Good morning, Nancy.
Good morning.

Man walking.

Put your left hand on top of your head.

Now the other one.

In the years since
my client's incarceration...

A 12-year sentence for manslaughter
during a bank robbery.

In the years since
Michael Bosworth's incarceration,

he's completed the Johns Hopkins
creative writing workshop.

In addition, I present the court
two letters of character reference

from nationally known authors.

I'll produce transcripts from the mothers
of two men he shot down in the past.

I'll also point out that Michael Bosworth's
IQ has been measured above 130.

The prosecution concedes that
Michael Bosworth is very intelligent.

But we also know
he always reverts to violence.

The charge before the court
is attempted murder.

It defies all reason that Bosworth
would jeopardise a flawless prison record

by attacking a guard...

I'm not a case history.

The defendant will speak
only when spoken to.

Bailiffs, sit this man down.

I'm just pro bono work
for her rich daddy's law firm.

Bailiffs, sit the man down.

I wanna go pro per.
I demand to represent myself.

My life is in jeopardy
from every guard in that prison.

And Nancy Breyers' defence is trivial,
unsuitable, weak and defeatist.

Mr Bosworth, if necessary,
I will have you gagged and bound.

Ms Breyers has represented you
diligently these past weeks.

You are fighting for your life.
You may not go pro per.

Your Honour, may I be permitted
to confer with my client in private?

I got nothing to say to you.

Permission granted.
I got nothing to say.

Man walking.

I'm gonna grab a sandwich.
You got it.

Stand right here.

Ma'am.

Hold it right there, buddy.
You stay here.

I am trying to think what more I can do
to convince you of my competence.

Please, I worked very hard to help you.

Please, I've worked very hard.

Relax, cowboy.

Hook him up. Hook him up.

Better do what he says.
Please put your hands behind your back.

Son of a bitch.

Whatever I do,
it's only because I need you.

Say you need me.
I need you.

I want you to act scared of me.
I am scared of you.

I knew something'd go wrong.
You got no faith.

Nancy. Hi. I thought you were
supposed to be in court this morning.

I gotta get going.

I'll wait for you...
Open your eyes and look at me!

I'll wait for you as long as it takes.

Nancy! Nancy!

My brother knows what he's doing.
Open the door!

Where's the lawyer?
Get outta here!

Nancy, are you OK?

Daddy!
Hey, Zack. How you doin'?

OK.
Is Mom in?

Come and see Mommy.

Hey, Mom! It's Daddy.
What are you doing in shorts?

It's almost winter. Go up and get changed.

You're not supposed
to be here till this afternoon.

Hey.

I'm surprised you guys
are talking to each other.

I love your hair like that.
It's beautiful when you wear it that way.

Come on.
I'm late.

Mom, Kyle will be driving me
to riding class after school.

If it makes you feel better,
she's harder on me when we're alone.

Hey, come here. I want to talk to you.

She still going out with Kyle?

Nora?

Nora?

I never liked that kid.

Kids his age are supposed
to be cocky, full of life.

You know what I mean?

Trouble is, Kyle thinks too much.
We can't all be full of surprises like you.

Kyle's reliable.
She says if she marries him,

she won't have to worry about him
running off with some female half his age.

Of course, I'm only quoting.
That is not fair, Nora.

OK, so Karen is 24 years old. So what?
Fair?

Is that what you still think
life has to be, Tim? Fair?

Jesus Christ!
When are you gonna grow up?

I am trying.

I came to tell you that Karen is over.
I've broken up with her.

Poor baby. Abandoned at her tender age.

I came hoping to talk with you.
What are we doing, wrestling?

You're never here when I pick up Zack.

We have nothing more
to say to each other.

You wanna talk to me, talk.
Then leave me alone.

They're at it again.
Go put on your pants, OK?

Do you need any money?
Anything you and the kids need?

Please, Tim, not that!
What do you want?

What I have always wanted.

Somebody I can trust.
Somebody I can depend on.

Not you.

I do want to tell you one thing.
I figured it out.

I took up with Karen
because she wasn't you.

Even dumb me figured that one out.

Now I've broken it up with her
because she wasn't like you.

I can't believe anything you say, Tim.

I don't blame you.
Are you sure you want to sell the house?

The kids are settled here, and
all the work you've put in and everything.

OK, I'm sorry.

Too many bad memories, huh?

And good ones.
Good.

One thing you've gotta believe, Nora.
I never wanted to hurt you.

You struck out there.

Hey, Zack, come on, let's go!

Zack.
There's a brontosaurus in the pool.

No way. They've been extinct
for more than a million years.

How about a kiss?

Don't forget to tell your English teacher
the difference between "lie" and "lay".

She'll flunk me for being a smart-ass.
I doubt it.

Can I get a kiss? Just a friendly kiss?

Bye-bye, Mom. See you later.

I'll call this afternoon. Will you be here?
I don't think so.

I'll leave a key under the mat.
You take care, now.

You too.

You sure?

Sorry.

See you later.

Hey, young fella.
Hi.

You wanna drive?
It'd be great.

Move over.
All right.

Go on.
Come on, Dad. Come on.

Let's go.
Bye, Mom! Bye! Bye, Mommy!

Now what?

Are you gonna take a swim?

I don't get it.
Won't the cops be looking for the car?

So they will, Albert, so they will.
But not this one.

Feast your eyes, boys.
It's a Jaguar.

We're gonna steal a Jaguar?
Where did you get the keys?

You know who God helps,
don't you, brother?

I never even rode in a Jaguar before.
Hey, I told you. That's my brother.

Mike, can I drive?
Sure, you can drive.

You can drive that beat-up old Cougar
right into the lake.

Take this!

Albert, can you whistle?
Sure.

I want you to whistle so I can hear you.

I don't want you to stop unless you see
somebody comin' down the road.

Hey, Albert!

Move the goddamn log out of the way!

Geronimo!

Whoo! Mikey! Whoo! Mikey!

Mikey! Mikey!

She's good. She's real good.

You gotta hand it to her -
she's holdin' up real well.

And I hate playing
good cop, bad cop. It's bullshit.

I was too hard on her.

The lady is a liar. Among other things.

How do you get that?
I've got a feeling.

Call it women's intuition.

Bob? Bob?
Yeah?

This is Carl Ornitz from the US Attorney's
office. He has some news for us.

Not news for the good of mankind,
I assume.

When Bosworth
was originally prosecuted,

a significant part of the government's
case was excluded from the trial

because of an inadmissible confession.

When he was being pursued
he broke into a liquor store.

He wanted to take the clerk with him.
The owner resisted. He was found shot.

A couple of weeks later,
Bosworth was arrested.

He confessed to the crime
before he was read his rights.

We think he confessed on purpose.

He was never tried for murder,
only for armed robbery.

The thing is he had a prior conviction
for burglary. The people were at home.

He held 'em hostage...
And?

And, as usual, somebody got dead.
Are you gonna file on her?

Better. I'm lettin' her go.

What are you talking about?
I haven't even done my affidavit yet.

Let's get a Title-3 for her phone.

Evidence won't help us with this lady,
even if we had cold proof.

Even if that marshal recovers, she'd waltz
into court and say she was mesmerised.

"He made me do it." Temporary insanity.

Look at her. She's too smart.

I want her to be free as a kite.

I want her to go to him
because she wants him.

Then we'll take the lovebirds together.

Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief.

I liked the one with the swimming pool.
That's pretty nice.

I think we should get the hell outta here.

Son of a bitch.

Yeah, my heating has gone.
My house was freezing last night.

What's the address again?
1448 Whitney Drive.

When can you get someone out here?
We're really backed up.

We'll get someone out there
as soon as we can.

Is that soon as in "real soon",
or soon as in "whenever we feel like it"?

Do I put it on the radio or not?

Yeah. OK, just get somebody
out here, please. Thank you.

Calm.

Good morning. You called about
a winter cover for your pool?

What? No, I'm sorry. This house is sold.

Unless my husband may have called.

Yes, it was your husband.
But, no. He'd have told me about this.

If you scream, your children will come
home and find you in a pool of blood.

Please, what do you want?

Hey, there's a swimming pool
in the back. And it's heated.

Someone left a bikini on the grass.
That's my daughter's.

Oh, yeah? How old? Is she cute?

Keys to the station wagon?

The keys?
I can help you. You're scared now.

The fear will pass.
You'll feel proud of yourself.

And I'll feel proud of you.

The keys.

No one's gonna hurt you.

I promise.

OK? You're gonna learn to trust me.

You probably can't absorb
any of this right now.

But you and I are gonna be friends.

Would you like to go upstairs
and put something else on?

Albert! What are you doing up there?

Albert, were you in Nora's bedroom?

You are never to enter that bedroom
without Nora's permission.

I parked the Jag in the garage.

Let's just take the car and go.
I don't like it here.

Then you leave.

You're only here because when I was
in prison, my brother needed your help.

I want you to go through the house.
Look for money and jewellery.

Nora, sit down. Sit down.
I wanna reassure you.

You have a daughter, May?
How did you know her name?

I was going through
your husband's letters, and... She's 15.

Then there's the younger child.
Zack, he's...

He's eight? They come home
from school around what time?

Nora, don't make me resent the kids
before I even meet them.

Zack gets dropped off around three.

By a carpool?
Yes.

Does the parent come to the door?

No. Picking the children up is hectic
enough without dropping them off.

Give me a break, lady.

Do you think you could
speak on the telephone without crying?

If you can, we can be outta here
a hell of a lot faster.

Yes, anything.
You're a strong woman, Nora.

Smart men love strong women.
What if they tap Nancy's phone?

She's a victim. They'd never suspect her.

I'm a very fair man, Nora.

I'd never hurt anyone
unless they were trying to hurt me.

I swear it.

Here's what I want you to say:

"Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.
Just called to gossip. Nothing important."

And I want you to leave her
this number. All right?

Now you try it.

Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.

Just nothing important. Just called...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

I want you to smile.
OK, there. That's it. Big smile.

You've got a beautiful smile.

You try it.

Smile.

Hi, this is Nancy. Please leave
your message after the beep.

Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.

Nothing important. Just called to say hi.

Call me back at 555-4810.

Bye.

Good girl.

Nora! Nora!

Come on, open up, Nora.

Open the door.

Come on. I want to apologise.

I'll camp outside.

I once waited in line two days.

Tickets for the World Series,
so I mean business.

Open up! I'm gonna break in,
like the big, bad wolf.

Nora!

I'm not gonna ask again.

Open up!

Hey! Anyone home?

Nora?

Hey. I wanna apologise for this morning.

Tim!
No! No!

Enough! Enough!

He was gonna use it on me!
Enough!

Albert, you're frightening Nora.
I don't give a shit.

Everything's under control.

Timmy's got the idea.

He's gonna do exactly as we say.
Are you gonna be all right?

What the fuck is going on?
Who are these guys?

He's gonna be just fine,
as soon as he figures out the rules.

Here's $500.

MasterCard. Visa. Take it. Take it all.

Are you considering the options now?
Force? Negotiation?

Maybe a little psychology?

What do you want?
I'm waiting for my fiancée.

I just want a place to relax.

What if the police followed you?
I won't lie to you.

If they touch me, they touch you.

Why here? Why my house?
Fate.

Besides, this isn't your house any longer.
I saw a "for sale" sign out front.

There's a kid out there.
"For sale" is a trouble sign.

We can leave now. Take me as a hostage.

You think before you act.
Mom, I'm hungry!

Hit him. You want to beat Tyson?

Yeah.
Duck and hit from the same side he did.

I'm not even past Bald Bull.

When you get your start button,
use it as soon as you get it.

Hey, Zack, what's goin' on?

Mom? Mommy!
Don't ever touch my kid!

Mommy!
Zack.

Let's all relax. I got
some questions I want answers to.

Do you have a gun in the house?
It's not safe with the kids around.

You're not around here
to protect Nora any longer.

Did you get a gun when Timmy left?

No guns.

So, is there any chance that anyone
from your office would be stopping by?

What does a man like you
do to have all this?

I was a corporate lawyer, but I quit
so I could defend psychopaths like you.

Wally, I want you to take the brat
into the other room. Now.

What are they gonna do to me?
It's OK. We'll play some TV.

I won't hurt him. It's OK.

Move it, Wally.
Mommy!

It'll be OK.

You were once a successful lawyer
and you gave it all up

to work for something more meaningful?

Gee, why did you do that?
You wanna know the truth?

I watched too many Westerns.
I wanted to be the sheriff.

Nora, what did you have
prepared for dinner?

I have a turkey.
Anything else you want?

I'd like to wash. Nora, you don't suppose
Timmy has any fresh shirts in the closet?

I like to dress for dinner.

How did he talk you into this, Wally?
Nobody talked me into nothing.

Really? Seems to me
you're in deep shit, kid.

A man is not a gentleman unless
he knows how to mix a proper martini,

or tie a proper bow tie.

Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.
Nothing important.

Just called to say hi.
Call me back at 555-4810.

555-4810.

Where's the heat in this place?
It doesn't work.

Better be careful with these things, Sheriff.

You could get yourself hurt.

Shouldn't your girlfriend
have called by now?

And yours?

Mike! Michael, it's the news!

Attorney Nancy Breyers
says it's a miracle

escaped killer Michael Bosworth
did not kill her.

Police report she's cooperating...
I knew we should get out of here.

She's cooperating.
I told you she would do that.

You heard that, right?
Now for the latest weather...

You're as thick as two bricks.

Don't you see that
the more she cooperates

the more they're going to
think she's a victim?

Will you do me a favour, Wally?

Don't think.
Don't talk to me like Albert.

I'm your brother.
Right, come here.

Don't you understand, huh?
Listen to me. Look at me.

I love her. She's the only person
that I'd die for.

Now you get it together.

Look at you. You're blushing.
Is he gonna come in?

He never does.

She's some piece of work.
Don't hurt her. Don't let him.

I didn't mean any disrespect.

I would never hurt
your daughter, or any girl.

That's the old spirit, Tim.
Take it all the way. Come on.

If that kid comes in here,
I'm gonna start with you.

Hi, Kyle. Hi, honey.

Daddy, hi.
Hi.

You mad at me?
Mad at you? No. I love you.

I love you. Hey, you know what?

Look, why don't I buy you guys dinner?
Just go and have some fun.

Mom wants you to spend the weekend
with me. I'll see you over at my place.

I can't. I work tonight, sir.

Take the night off.
I'll pay double time. Go on, take it.

Hey, May! May!

May! Come back. May!

There's nothing we can do, May.

Give me back my Walkman.

No!

Easy, Albert! Easy, easy! Easy, Albert!

What?
Easy.

What the fuck is going on here?

May, I'm getting really angry.

You wanna point your gun at someone,
point it at me.

Wanna threaten someone? Threaten me.
Sheriff, you just don't get it.

May, listen to me. You do as they say.

They're very dangerous.

They're fucking idiots.

Stop it!
No, Daddy!

Albert, put him down.

No! Daddy!

Stop it!

It's not over.
I promised Nora no one's gonna get hurt.

Nora, please sit down.

Zack.
Yes, Daddy?

Now it's way past your bedtime.

OK, Daddy.
Zack.

What?
What do you wanna do?

I don't know. Play Nintendo, maybe.
You're going to bed. We have rules.

You're not giving the orders
in the house any more, Timmy.

There's too many rules.
Zack, go play.

Live a little.

Good night, Mommy. I love you.
I love you.

Daddy, don't let him hurt us.
I know. Come on, come on.

Be strong, kid. I'm proud of you.
You're gonna be fine.

No, Daddy, please.
I don't want to go. I'm scared.

You're gonna be fine. Come on.

Come on.
OK.

OK, OK.

Hey, Zack, where you goin'?

I'm goin' to bed!

You live by too many rules.

I certainly feel sorry for Nora.
Take your hands off her.

Is that another rule, Tim?
You bet.

There's a guy out there!
I think he's a plumber or something.

From the heating company. Somebody
was supposed to come this morning.

You get rid of 'em.

I called you this morning.
You're my fifteenth service call today.

You have to pay whether I come in or not.

It's too late! My kids are already asleep.
You still have to pay. $48,06.

I have to get a cheque.

48 bucks, for not doing a damn thing.

That's why America's becoming a
second-rate country. I wouldn't pay him.

What difference does it make?
I thought you wanted him to go!

It's the principle.

You could have been 1,000 miles away.

Now you're trapped here.
You're tryin' to fuck me up.

I'm not listening.

Write another cheque.

You get rid of him.

Want a receipt?
A cancelled cheque will be fine.

You OK?

Liar.

Nora?

Hey! Hold it! I know how to use it.

Let her go!

May, go upstairs. Now.

Let her go, Wally.

Let her go, Wally.

Albert, huh? Albert for Nora?

I read your letters to Nora, Tim.

You both want to rekindle
your passion for life.

Hey, I know that feeling.
I know that feeling.

And you're both liars. Mendacity is
the great sin that's destroying America.

And I'm a living reproach to you,
cos I'm an honest man.

You wanna destroy me,
but you're no match for me.

It's a judgement call, Tim.

Huh? It's your move.
You wanna play this game?

But you gotta be willing to go all the way.

Come on. Come on.

Come on.

Don't hurt him!

I really like this family,
but you're pushing my patience.

He was gonna cut my throat.
So what?

Albert! Albert!

What are we doing?
You idiot!

You see what happens
when you lie, Nora?

You're lucky he's still alive.

Get Timmy upstairs now.

You need stitches.
May, help me with this. May!

Are you OK, Dad?
May!

Put your finger up there.

Tim, you can't go on
taking chances like that. You can't.

You just don't know...
There's nothing else to do.

Move your hand, Zack.
I'm gonna be OK.

Everything will be fine. They'll leave soon.

Rip me off some tape.
Why not shoot them with Mommy's gun?

What? You got a gun?
Where'd you get a gun?

I bought it when you left.
Why?

I was scared at night. I was afraid at night!

You got a gun?
Pull me off some tape.

Where's the gun, Mom?

Clipped on top of that cabinet.

More tape. Tape! Hurry, Zack.

I'm trying, Mommy.
Quietly, OK?

Here?
More.

Mom, the gun is not here.
It is up there somewhere.

One of the retards must have found it.

I'm sure Bosworth doesn't know, anyway.

May, remember when you jumped
from here to the garage roof?

She broke her arm.

I was a little girl then. I could make it now.

It's a closer angle from Zack's room.
Can you try it? Just jumping off.

Daddy, I'm too scared.

You know heights make him dizzy.
I won't let them take the chance.

What if they fall or get caught?
They're in the same situation as now.

Isn't it worth a chance?

Thanks.

Zack, don't try till it's light.
No. No!

OK.
What if Bosworth is telling the truth?

What if he really doesn't mean to hurt us?

Michael wants the children to sleep
in their own room tonight.

Zack, come on. I'll tell you a story.

Zack, I'll tell you a story.

Zack.

See you in the morning.

If they make it out tonight, we won't be
Bosworth's favourite family any more.

I hold you responsible
for everything that's happened, Tim.

He kept his word.

Nobody got hurt
until you broke your word.

Nora, everything that happened
up to now doesn't matter, doesn't exist.

Yesterday we were bickering about
who got to keep the golf membership.

You can't believe him, Nora.
You have to trust me.

You have to trust me.

I just wanna go to sleep.

I just wanna go to sleep
and never wake up.

Here.

I love you.

She's going to cross the state line.
Of course she is.

I hate it when you talk like
you already know what's happening.

Hate is a strong word, Bob.
Just stay with her.

The primary's stopping at a phone booth.

I can't make out the number.

I'm sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialled.

Please check the number and dial again.

Tell Tail-End Charlie to pick up
the number on that payphone,

call the phone company
and find out who she called at 7.15 am.

Goddammit. Stay with her.

This bitch is gonna get us killed.

We're losing her.

Let the state police book her,
but make sure they keep it quiet.

I want Bosworth to be expecting her.

While Romeo waits,
we'll have a chat with Juliet.

You answer it.

Hello.

Hello, Kyle.

I'll have to see if she's here. Hold on.

It's for May.

May?

May!
Wally, bring the kids down, now.

I'm here.

Hi.

Hi. I'm sorry, Dad.

I'm sorry.

You're sorry about what?

Sorry to be here with people like you.
May, it's Kyle.

Hello.
Hi.

I called you at your dad's.

He went out of town.

Do you want to meet me
at the lake in an hour?

No, I'm busy.

You were going to be with me today.

Well?

Hello?

What are you being such a bitch for?
Because I am.

Now, you can't stay here much longer.

Somebody's bound to notice.
People see things.

People see what they wanna see.

Hey, May, why don't you
make us some coffee?

Go on, honey. Go on.

I'll go with her.
It's OK, I'll go.

What about the other kid?

Go upstairs and get him.

Michael!

Hey, Mike! Mike!

Zack!

I don't know if you should be
climbing around like that.

Hey, that's a big drop.
Hello.

Hi.
How are you doin'?

Is Mrs Cornell in?

I'm Ed Tallent, her real-estate man.

Somethin' wrong here?

Nothing's wrong, real-estate man.
Get in here.

Ed! Christ, Ed.
What the hell are you doing here?

Ed, for God's sake.

I just came by to tell Nora there were
some problems with the closing.

I think that we may not be able
to make escrow by Christmas.

Zack, May. Go upstairs, now.
But...

Don't argue with me! Get outta here.

This is not good, Michael.

Now, look. Ed can stay with us till you go.
He won't be a problem.

There's a lady raking leaves,
looking over here.

Albert, now is not the time
to do something dumb.

I say he cannot stay here.
Albert!

You won't be here that much longer.

Ed can stay in the basement if you want.

We can all stay down there if it
makes you easier. I give you my word.

Come on, I swear it.

Now maybe you'll understand.

God. Oh, God.

What is she doing? Jesus Christ.
Calm down, Albert.

Albert, just calm down.

He doesn't care about you, Albert.
You're not part of his planning.

He's gonna kill you too.
You know, Albert, you're so dumb.

I can't take it here, Michael.

We're gonna go right now.
And I'm not foolin' around.

Albert, where did you get the gun?

Where'd you get the gun, Albert?

I found it.

Nora. Hey, Nora, did you lie to me?

I didn't mean to lie to you.

I didn't mean to lie, but you lied to us.
You said you'd be gone by midnight!

Shut up! Shut up!

Goddammit, Albert,
gimme the gun. Gimme the gun.

I can't handle this. It's too much.

I'm going.

Well, why not?

You can go.
What are you talking about?

It's best we split up now.

Do me a favour before you go, Albert.

Get rid of the dead.
You mean that...

I can go?

Yeah.

Yeah, you head south.

And we'll all meet up in Juárez.

What the hell's goin' on here, Mike?

I'm killing two birds with one stone.

Timmy and his family want us to leave.

Then they're gonna have to help us.

How?
You're gonna have to drop by the bank.

Ten thousand would be just fine.
I don't have that much money.

You gonna start lying to me again?
Someone's gonna have to go with him.

He's gonna go straight to the police!
What did I tell you?

Stop thinkin'. He's goin' all by himself.

He's mad, but he's scared.

Come on.

I'll see you guys in Mexico.

Mexico. Definitely Mexico.

I've never been alone.

Not since...

I met Wally when we were little kids.

Get the door.

Got only one thing for you
to think about out there.

Any red-light show,
any sirens, they get it first.

Not you, them. You think about that.

Good morning, sir.

Sorry.
She was next.

We usually require your wife's signature.

My wife's not well.
I've been banking here for 14 years.

I opened the account myself
and I want to close it out myself.

I'll have to talk to Mr Nelson.
Is he in? Good.

Mr Cornell? You know there's a penalty
for cashing these certificates out?

I know that. But it's unavoidable, you see.

I just need the cash. It's an emergency.

If you'll sign right there,
I'll cash you out, Mr Cornell.

Cashiers' cheque?
No, cash, please.

Cash.

And one more, please.

Very kind of you. Thank you.
It'll be a moment.

Here you are, Mr Cornell.
But please count it.

I'm sure it's OK. Thanks.

Thanks a lot.

Who's next, please?

The FBI announced today it will not
file charges against Nancy Breyers

in connection with the escape
of accused killer Michael Bosworth.

Breyers was not available for comment.

We'll keep you posted
with further information as it b...

She's in control.
So why doesn't she call?

She will.

She will?

What do you find so amusing?

You.

Wally.

Looks like you won
the Vietnam war all by yourself.

That's a good boy.

I knew you wouldn't take any chances.

What have you got?
I'm not sure.

A body's been found
in the south of the county.

A real-estate agent named Ed Tallent,
shot at point-blank range.

It may mean nothing.
Where was he found?

In a riverbed. His car is on the scene,
about five hours from here.

Probably does mean somethin'. Get me
the addresses of all his residential listings.

It's my opinion Bosworth believes
he can escape from anywhere.

I'd like to start settin' up
roadblocks in the area.

Request denied. Bosworth's in a house,
and there sure as hell are hostages.

That's the way he plays.

Your orders are to wait for me
to give you more orders.

Thank you, ma'am.

Maddox!

If you learn anything, don't drift away!

I'm just a cheap float in a stormy sea.

Yeah, it was beautiful. It was great.

I'll call you later.

Hey.

Which way are you guys goin'?

Sorry.

What college do you go to?

Fuck off.
Aw, come on.

I just need a lift a little ways. That's all.

Go away, please!
Come on.

Lisa, call the police now! Run! Run!

Get away from me!

We got a report of a man
covered in blood harassing two girls

at the gas station on Waxman Road.

We're there.

You, in the water!

Drop your weapon!

Hey! You, in the water!

Drop your weapon!

I'm not gonna tell you again!
Put the gun down!

Put the gun down!

That gun the kid was carrying
is registered to a Nora Cornell,

on Whitney Drive, which is right here.

Give me those residential listings.

On that call the primary placed from
the phone booth - it went to a residence.

Timothy and Nora Cornell,
1448 Whitney Drive.

You answer now.

Start talking.

What?
Is Michael there?

Yes, he is.

If this is a trick,
you can kiss your family goodbye.

Yes?
Michael?

Nancy?

Nancy! Where are you?
I'm close.

Did they believe you?
Of course they believed me.

Baby, you're brilliant. Oh, you're brilliant!

Oh, God, I miss you.

We're at 1448 Whitney.
How long will it take?

I can get there in less than an hour.
You just be careful. You stay calm.

Just think about us together.
I will.

I love you.
I love you too.

She's on her way.

She's on her way. It's almost over, Timmy.

I'll be out of here in less than an hour.

What about us?

Timmy, have I ever
broken any promises to you?

Let's go!

Where is she?
She's back at the command post.

OK, let's have it. But make it fast.

All right. Right now,
she's officially just an innocent civilian.

No charges.
If she cooperates.

And if you send her in there
and anything happens tonight,

they'll have our ugly asses in court.

No, only one ass is involved.

Mine.

And what's ugly about it?

We've got exigent circumstances here.
The rules don't apply.

We've got a ticket to ride.

I just don't think it's worth the chance.

The guy is a fuckin' maniac.

He's not afraid to die.
Maddox is right.

It's only a matter of time
before we go tactical on this shithead.

Listen closely while I pull rank on you.

We're doin' it my way.

We will discuss it no more, for ever.

Get it off her. He'll search her.

He trusts me.
Get it off.

Remember now, all you have to do
is to get him to leave.

Once you're well away from here,
stop at some rest room down the road.

We'll take it from there.
I understand.

If you don't, you know what's
gonna happen to you, don't you?

I told you. I want to live.

My knees are shaking.
I can hear your knees.

You do this, no charges will be brought.
You can't turn your back now.

If you do, we're gonna take casualties.
I know. I know.

You think she'll think straight
when she's with Bosworth?

She's got her brains between her legs.

I can be inside that house in one minute.
Flashbangs at the door.

We make a three-point entry, it's all over.
We're givin' that family a chance.

The way they played along, maybe
they don't have any chance coming.

You don't give a damn, do you?

If it goes sideways,
we'll waste the whole neighbourhood.

Don't forget to smile when you see him.

He might want me to...

Well, smile when you do that too.

Oh, God, I can't.

You can.

I'm not ready to die.
Then you make sure

you do just what I told you.

What happens when we come outside?

What if he realises what I'm doing to him?

I want a gun, or I won't go in. I won't.

I just put my ass on the line.

Now you get outta here.
My earrings are killing me.

I'm in a real bad mood.

You be careful.

I'm passing command to you.

If you fuck this up, you'll leave
your badge in a manila envelope.

'Cause I don't want to see you
when I get back.

I'm goin' to the observation point.

Subject is on the scene.

I know that they tried
to get you to betray me.

Let me introduce you to the Cornells.

I got this wacko in my sights.
I think I can take him.

That's Zack, and May.

And Nora. This is
the greatest woman in the world.

My God, what are you doing?
You must be insane.

You shut up!
Zack, go upstairs, now.

Nancy, I have somethin' that I wanna...

I wanna give to you. It's gonna keep us
together for the rest of our lives.

I can't take that.
This used to be Nora's.

What's going on?
Turn around.

I gotta get through to see somebody.
We got a problem with the traffic.

Hey!

Jesus Christ! We've got company.

Goddamn son of a bitch.

It's too late. See what he does.

May!
Who's that?

It's May's boyfriend.

Come on, May, open up.

Hi, Kyle. How you doin', kid?

I'm sorry to stop by so late, but I...

May and I had a fight, and if she could go
for a ride with me, I'd really appreciate it.

She may still be angry, pal. I'll ask her.

I'll wait for her here.
OK, you bet.

He wants to take May for a ride.
He won't leave without her.

That's one less we gotta worry about.
Then you call her.

May!

May, come down, please.

May, Kyle's outside.

He wants to make it up with you.
Now, you have to go. Now.

Go on with him.

I'm not leaving
unless my mom stays here.

Nora's comin' with me.

What for?
So you don't call the cops when we go.

Bosworth, you are so close.
Don't blow it.

If she doesn't go,
Kyle will make a scene. I know it.

Let her go, Mike, please.

You and I have a date with destiny, Tim.
You'll be comin' with me, after all.

I could trust Nora
more than I could trust you.

Dad, what about you?

We're gonna win if you do as he says.

I love you, Daddy.

I love you.

Go.

OK, OK.

You go with your boyfriend, May.

You go far away.

Otherwise I'm gonna kill your daddy.

Are you OK?
I'm fine.

I don't know what's goin' on,
but let's get outta here.

Right. You move it. You get the car.

Mr Cornell, I'm Special Agent Brenda
Chandler, FBl. We're here to help you.

You can't do that.
You'll get my family killed.

We're gonna let them drive away.

No, I'm going with them.
Bosworth and his brother and the girl.

You're hurt.
No, I'm not.

I'm OK.

Don't take long in there.
He's gonna go suicidal any minute now.

Why are you doin' that?
A wild idea. You have to trust me.

Mr Cornell.

If we have to go tactical,
we're gonna take casualties.

It's one more chance I'll have to take.

How come I didn't hear the car start?
No key.

Put your arms up.

What is this? Huh? What's this?

Huh? What the fuck is this?
I found it on the seat of her car.

I was... I was scared.

All right. You get goin' now.

I wanna say goodbye to Zack.

Hey, Daddy.
There's people with guns outside.

I saw them. I'm scared.
Shh.

You must be quiet.

You can't do this to me.
You've got to speak quietly.

Are they gonna shoot us?
No, no. They're here to help us.

I know you're scared.
But we mustn't let the men know.

OK, I'll be back soon.

Tim.
What?

Tim,

there's so many things I want to tell you.

And I don't have time to tell you.
I know. Me too.

This place is a tomb.
You two get out first. Get in the back.

Nancy, start the engine.
Don't turn on the lights.

Shit.
Nancy, what's wrong?

No!

Hold it! Hold it!

Hold it, Bosworth!

Where are you hit?
In the ego!

Get me a bullhorn!

What if they shoot Daddy?
They won't.

You betrayed me!
Michael, no!

Michael, please.

I did all this for you!

You shut up. Shut up. This ain't over.

You watch him.

This is Michael Bosworth speaking.
So before you start with your bullshit,

I want a car here to take three,
no, four people to the airport.

I want a plane with five hours of fuel.
I'll see what I can do on that.

Don't you start lying to me.
I know who's in charge out there.

You listen to me. I want all your people
out of there in ten minutes,

or I'll kill the whole family.

We can't negotiate him out.
There are four hostages.

Bosworth needs killing.
We don't violate the rules

until they don't work.

Everyone's alive. So far,
this is still a potential win.

Someone bring a four-door car
to the house. Now.

Be careful, Zack. Be careful, honey.

It's OK, Mommy, don't worry.

Be careful!
I love you. You'll be OK.

Drop him!

They're gonna get us outta here yet!

Wally!

Give me the gun.
Nora!

Nora!
You're dying, Wally.

You're dying. You're not going anywhere.
Nora!

Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

Goddammit! Get over here!

Get over here!
No!

Wally!

Oh, God.

I have decided
I love your family too much.

You're all coming with me.
The more the merrier, right?

You're through, Bosworth. It's over.

You stay right there
or you're going to kill your wife.

Tim!
It's OK, Nora.

Tim.
I'm still in control, Timmy.

Tim!
Nothing can happen to you, Nora.

If you never trusted me before,
you have to trust me now.

I'll blow her brains right across the room.

You know what size hole this calibre
bullet makes when it exits the other side?

He can't hurt you, Nora.

He can't hurt you, honey.

Your car is waiting, Bosworth.

Do not move!

Stay down!

Do not move! We'll come to you!

Nancy!

Blade, get her out of here, will ya?
