(eerie music playing)
(whimpering)


Following the sign
to Camp Crystal Lake

can only mean one thing...
bad luck.

For her, not for us.

You see in 1980 when
producer/director Sean Cunningham

released a little film
into the world called "Friday the 13th,"

not even he could have
imagined the success

or the fame or the carnage
that would ensue.

With 12 movies to date,

an endless body count

and over a half billion
in worldwide box-office dollars,

"Friday the 13th" gave birth

to one of the greatest
cinematic villains of our time.

She doesn't know what she's in for.

So lock up your cabin doors,
zip up your tents

and make sure that
your car does indeed start,

because tonight
he could be anywhere.

So you wondering
who I'm talking about?

His name was Jason.

(blood splattering)


For some of us,

the problems we have as adults
go back to our mothers.

In the case of Jason,

truer words
were never spoken.

(man softly)
Kill kill kill...

In the late '70s,
Steve Miner and I had made a couple

of children's movies

and neither one of them
was very successful.

And we had to do something
to keep the lights on.

And so we came up with this notion
of doing "Friday the 13th."

We had a title and a need

to make some money.
(shatters)

The thing about the story
is that it's so profoundly simple.

The longest part of the process
of creating the first "Friday the 13th"

was figuring out the venue,

so I had to find some territory
that was adult-free

so that these kids would be
on their own

and we could pick them off
one by one.

My character was sort of like

the Janet Leigh in "Psycho."

I'm the setup character
to follow,

but I didn't last too long.

We ran into the woods
where it was safe.

Cunningham:
We had this notion that these kids

would be out at a summer camp
and would be threatened

by some kind of serial killer.

We would then be surprised
to discover

who the serial killer was at the end.

Mrs. Voorhees,
who is mighty pissed off

that her son Jason

drowned while
a couple of counselors

were off boning somewhere.

The counselors weren't
paying any attention.

They were making love
while that young boy drowned.

The scariest moment
in the original movie

is when Alice realizes

that Pamela is the killer.

Kill her, Mommy!

Kill her!

And that's the beginning
of the chase at the end of the movie.


And when we think all is quiet

and she survived
that horrible Friday the 13th...

The boy, is he dead too?

Policeman: Who?

The one who attacked me, the one
who pulled me underneath the water!

Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

Then he's still there.

And he certainly was.

Lauren-Marie Taylor:
Before we started filming "Part 2,"

they had us watch
the original "Friday the 13th,"

which almost scared me off
to not doing the project,

'cause it really freaked
me out.

After the first one

Jason had been created,

so the notion of having a surprise

as to who it is or what it is
changed completely.

So what the stories became

was sort of a ritualized telling

of a group of young people
who go someplace

where they shouldn't go.
(gasps)

What are you kids
doing out here?

We come back to Crystal Lake
to open up this camp again.

The ghost of the past,

Jason comes to haunt them.

Todd:
And one by one,

Jason Voorhees kills us

and continues to do
what he does best.

"Part 2" was basically
his journey

of seeking revenge
over the death of his mother.

And he's got her
decapitated head

on his mantelpiece.

He just keeps killing and killing.

And that's the journey
that's taken us for 30 years.

It's remarkable.

Cunningham: I really thought
it wasn't gonna work the way it did,

and I'm delighted
to have been so wrong.

"Friday the 13th Part III"...
we get the gimmick movie.

"Friday the 13th III" in 3D,
and that is also the movie

where Jason will choose
his infamous mask.

The day after the events
in "Part 2"...

so it's technically
Saturday the 14th,

but don't tell anyone...
a group of teenagers

all go up to the cabin
to visit Chris Higgins,

little knowing that Jason

is still out there killing everyone.

Ugh!

Through all the 3D movies
I've ever done,

nobody talks about any of them.

All they ever wanna
talk about is when can we see

"Friday the 13th" in 3D.

Ryan Rotten: Four is where things
start getting interesting.

It starts to introduce
a protagonist Tommy Jarvis,

who we'll start seeing
in other sequels.

I was told that this was
gonna be the last of the series.

And this again would be
about death at the end,

because Jason was going to die.

Barney Cohen: Jason had been hit
in the head with an axe.

He had been carted off in an ambulance.
We pick him up almost in real time

arriving dead at a hospital.

And then Jason breaks out
of the morgue.

Leave me alone!

And then the kids
in the car arrive at the lake

and bump into us.
There's skinny-dipping

and all kinds of things.
Partying... we're partying on down

and then we all got killed.

In very quick succession.

My character Rob
had a sister named Sandra,

who was a counselor
at Crystal Lake in "Part 2."

This dude looks like
he's been hunting Jason for years.

The one time I saw the movie...
going to the opening night screening

on Hollywood Boulevard...

during the whole entire movie
just people screaming,

it was like this cathartic
experience for everybody.

It's a thrill ride.

I remember that we're supposed
to think Corey Feldman's

gonna pick up the torch
and be the next Jason.

"Part 5" was truly
a departure

because they went
in a totally different direction.

They decide they're gonna set it
in a halfway house

for weird fucked-up kids.

And there's this dude
and he's killing the kids off

and he's using Jason's mask.

We don't see Jason in that movie,
except for hallucinations,

flashbacks... that's it.

When the film opened
it was opening, I think,

in 2,000 theaters
across the country.

In 1984, that was a lot.

Frank Mancuso called me
late that night...

2:00, 3:00 in the morning,

so excited,
saying these numbers

are like the golden times.
This is unheard of.

Shavar Ross:
When the supposed Jason fell,

I love the part where
he just goes right through those spikes.

Because you can just see the dummy

just going right on the spike.

Another piece of advice,

don't allow the overweight
mentally-handicapped son

of the local ambulance driver
to get hacked to shit over a candy bar.

Because chances are
that driver's gonna turn

into a Jason clone
and try to take people out.

Adam Green: They brought him back
again in "VI," and he killed Horshack

at the beginning,
which was awesome.

And he was kind of like
Frankenstein because a lightning bolt

that came out of nowhere
brought him back to life,

and there was maggots on his face,
which was really cool.

I think it was extremely violent.

I mean, you look at it and you go,

"Wow, there's tongue-in-cheek
in this. There's rock music in this."

But Jason, in fact,
in this movie, bends people in half,

twists their heads off,
does a triple beheading.

I really didn't want it to be
just about you have sex and die,

'cause that had been done. It's sort
of like you're in the wrong place

at the wrong time kind of thing,

and also try to have the characters
have a sense of humor.

When Nancy's killed
and the American Express card floats

out of her hand, inevitably
there was always some clown

that would go,
"Don't leave home without it!"

Kevin Spirtas:
In "Part VII," the girl whose got these

extraordinary telekinetic powers

resurrects him by throwing
her anger and her energy

into the lake
where he's already been killed

from a previous movie.

She musters all of her
telekinetic ability to raise him

and thus begins the story.

That's what really made it different.
She had the psychic abilities

which he had not fought before,
but realistically,

the psychic stuff would have had
to have been in there anyway,

because this monster
kept coming back.

He's a surreal monster.

Jason, played by Kane Hodder,
I believe, for the first time.

"VII" starts the Kane Hodder era.

Everything about the way
Kane Hodder played him

makes him menacing
and yet he's human.

Elizabeth Kaitan: I remember thinking,
"Wow, this is Jason!"

I grew up watching this,
and here he is chasing me.


Since I was doing it for the first
time, there seems to be some anger there,

some differences that you
didn't see in Jason before.

The kids love
Kane Hodder's Jason.

Rob Galluzzo: The coolest
teaser trailer to a movie ever

was " Friday the 13th 8:
Jason Takes Manhattan."

You get this trailer
where you don't know what is it

and then they reveal that
it's Jason in the middle of the city.

I live in New York.
I was stoked. I was like,

"Oh my God. He's coming to New York.
He's coming to where I know."

When they first brought me in
to do the movie,

the first question I asked them was
does it have to be in Crystal Lake?

Can I take Jason out
of Crystal Lake?

The general plot
of "Friday the 13th Part 8"

is a young woman
and her graduating class

of Crystal Lake High going
on a big cruise to New York.

One by one,
the classmates are killed off.

The single most amazing thing
that I've ever done

as the character was shooting
the scenes in Times Square

in "Jason Takes Manhattan."

I felt like a rock star.

(raspy breathing)

"Part 9"...they went
from not having blood

to not having Jason.

There was something about Jason
transferring from body to body to body.

Joe Lynch:
Then Jason comes back to life

and to Crystal Lake
and is exploded

and becomes a bunch
of demon-hearted baby things

and decides to possess
a couple of people.

And then gets thwarted again by " 21
Jump Street" himself Steven Williams.

Adam Green:
He really wasn't in the movie.

It was kind of other people. Then if
he was in a mirror, you could see him.

And he could transport
into bodies.

But the best part was when
he was this little worm thing

and he went...
was it the girl from "Buck Rogers"?

Is that who she was? He went
in her pussy and that was awesome.

They basically tried
to create a mythology for Jason.

There are a lot of Jason fans
who to this day

are pissed off at me

for blowing up Jason.

James Isaac: "Jason X" takes place
400 years in the future.

And a group
of science students,

kids go on a field trip.

These students go on.
They're on the planet.

They're digging things up,
and of course they find Jason.

Anyway, Jason wakes up
and of course does what Jason does.

We set it up
that Kay-Em actually did kill him.

This time he got killed, right?

Then the nanobots
bring him together

and now he's part machine,

and so he's more unstoppable
than ever.

To this day, still,
when people mention that movie,

they're like,
"I love that fake boob scene!"

All right, the story
of "Freddy vs. Jason" is a hybrid story.

You're bringing these two
great characters together finally.

Tony Timpone:
It took them literally decades

before they came up with a story
that was strong enough

to support these two characters.

The premise of this movie
was for Freddy to use Jason

to get his powers back.

There came a point where
you had to choose a side.

And I was a Jason guy, always.

So for "Jason vs. Freddy,"
I didn't wanna see anything

but Jason kick Freddy's ass.

Lynch: If it wasn't for Alice killing
Mrs. Voorhees in that one film,

none of this would happen.

I like Jason Voorhees.
He has a backstory,

and he has a reason
for being the way he is.

What a messed up kid.

I think that just
in the overall energy

of trying to do it simple
and scary

was the thing that drove
the whole process forward.

After all that,
who could imagine that Jason,

the bloodthirsty
indestructible force of nature,

was at one time
an innocent kid

just like the rest of us?

Well, most of us.

Jason not only witnessed
his mother's beheading.

But he was shot and stabbed

and burned and sent to hell

and shot into outer space.

I think to really
understand Jason

you gotta go back
to the beginning...

who he is,
where he came from,

why he can't resist
a good kill.

(man softly)
Kill kill kill...

Does Jason have a soul?
I don't think so.

He is not mindless.
I think actually that's something

that the fans would like
to learn more about...

what's going on in his head.

Jason started
as a drowning victim.

That's as simple
as you can make it.

He's just a little boy
who was ignored

by his camp counselors
and couldn't swim very well

and drowned. And no matter
what movie you're talking about,

he's still a victim.

For any good villain,
there's always that sadness to them,

and that thing where you can
almost feel bad for them.

He didn't do anything wrong.
He didn't deserve to die.

Jason was the outcast. Jason was
the little kid who got picked on.

And now Jason's the one
who's getting the last laugh in a way,

or the last slash.

Who did it start with?
His mother.

I'm Mrs. Voorhees,
an old friend of the Christies.

The fact that she's a loon,
totally out of her mind

and also channeling her son
and going...

Kill her, Mommy.
Kill her!

The idea for the character
came out

of my own past.

Mrs. Voorhees
is the mother I never had.

She is the mother
who will kill people

to avenge her son's death.
But, hey,

if you're gonna have
a mother defend you,

she might as well be crazy.

Palmer:
They love Mrs. Voorhees.

And I've said to people,
I say, " Why do you love her

as much as you do
when she's supposed

to be this dreadful human being?"

And they say because
we understand why you did it.

Mrs. Voorhees was
really not a murderess.

All she was trying to do was
to protect other children

from being drowned.

One of the things that
really works for "Part 2"

is that you do have this kind
of passing of the baton

going from Mrs. Voorhees
to Jason.

Basically, he is fueled
by vengeance

for the death of his mother.

See, it's this seeking
righteous vengeance

that defines
the Jason character

and also separates
Jason Voorhees

from all the other horror icons.


King:
Jason's misunderstood.

What happens is

when he watches
Alice kill his mother,

I believe Alice unleashes
the monster in Jason.

You feel bad for anybody
who has to see

their mom get their head cut off
on a beach. I know I do.

Barton:
So he finds this potato sack,

throws it over his head,
cuts out his little eyehole

and does his thing. He starts
plying his craft for the first time

that he learned
from his mom.


I think he observed the camp
after many years,

kids coming and going.

I think at one point that's
when he decided to do what he did.

I think what he's doing
is protecting his home.

And anybody that walks
into his territory is kind of doomed.

Honestly, I don't think he's angry.
I think he's sad.

Poor Jason was brought
into this world

and he really had a tough start.

Kaitan:
If your mother killed a bunch of people,

you would be a very tragic child,
I would say.

It's like kind of a Ted Bundy
upbringing.

Here was this tortured soul

who lived for years

just on probably the revenge.

I think Ginny kind of understood

there's more to it than just
this demon guy.

Jason, Mother is talking to you.

By putting on his mother's sweater
and trying to speak like her,

it almost confused him
for a second.

King: You see him questioning,
is that my mother?

He wanted to believe
his mother was still alive.

I guess Jason was
a unique character.

He wasn't just somebody

who put on a facemask.

He was a whole creature.

Lynch: It's almost like Jason
is a personification

of the dark side of all of us.

I find in this character
elements of myself.

And there are monstrous elements
of myself

that are bent on self-destruction
and destroying others.

And there are parts of myself
that feel wronged

and I'm unjustly treated
and I'm the victim.

He just hated everything
about people.

His reason for killing
is just because he does.

Don't reason with him.
He doesn't reason with you.

It's all in his own head.

He just does it.

He's definitely
a tortured tragic soul,

but the truth is you can't go
around life with this badge

that you've been tortured
and kill and slash.

At some point,
it's gotta stop.

The main aspect

that enhances
the otherworldly character

of Jason is that
he's silent and faceless...

like death... the death mask.

It's plenty scary,
the mystery of the unknown.

What is behind that
potato sack?

In "Friday the 13th Part III,"

Jason wears, for the very first time,
a hockey mask,

which he has taken from Shelly

when Shelly made the bad mistake
of walking into the barn

carrying the hockey mask.

And the moment when he puts
on the hockey mask

and realizes it,
it's a great moment for the franchise,

'cause it's like,
"What was I thinking?

I should have been wearing
this all along. This is awesome."

This dock behind me,

this is where the legend
of Jason was born.

This is the first time
we saw him step out

in the hockey mask.

The birth of Jason.

There's something
to be said about

putting a mask on

and doing things
that you wouldn't normally do

with that mask off.

Katz:
Jason in "Part III" runs.

That's the one where he runs.
Jason's a bit of a manic hillbilly

in "III" still.
Got a little of that left over.

After that he becomes
the slow methodical stalker.

Todd Farmer: If he sees you,
he's not gonna stop.

It's like a beacon.
Once he's popped in on you,

he's gonna stay there
until he kills you.

And it doesn't matter
what he has to use.

He's terribly creative.
And he's got lots of weapons.

He really had a thing
for knives,

and he really had a thing
for machetes.

He likes to puncture
through the body...

He really likes spears.

...sawing off heads,
twisting heads, crushing heads...

Taylor:
He was really into anything

that would splash blood.

...punching heads off,
eyes popping out.

I mean, he's a showman.

It was really about
watching Jason do his thing.

He was the protagonist
in these films.

He has become
an anti-superhero.

So we just gotta come up
with a cape

for the Big J.

If we can just get him
to do some good stuff, though,

you know?
He's got the killing down.

Jason's always been
the underdog,

and everybody roots
for the underdog.

Roday:
It's every nerd's dream to get killed

and them come back
as a bad-ass

and start taking out
all the stereotypes

that pick on nerds.

Why do you do these stupid things?
I have to.

Carey More: I think he's a little bit
of a madman, perhaps.

Well, he seems
a little superhuman also

because he seems
to be able to revive

and take almighty blows
with hatchets and stuff.

Jason is a kid
who's just too stupid

to know that he's dead.

I think it's always
kind of inventive

how we would bring Jason back.
I always loved that.

It was almost like the cliffhangers
in the old serials.

How does he live
to see another day?

Something's gotta bring him back.
Why not lightning, right?

We can blow him up.
We can cut him up.

We can shoot him up. We can dice him up,
and he comes back for more.

It's great that as times change,
audiences change.

The creature, the monster, the villain, I
think is allowed to evolve.

Jason is the 21st-century killer.

He's good old blood and guts.

Shepherd:
I think that Jason is both a monster

and a victim.
This is a very deep character

that survived this many episodes
in killings and destructions

because he's larger than life.

He's still that little troubled

mentally-ill boy

trapped in the large body
of a killing machine.

He's become iconic in our lives.

Jason has no expiration date.



12 movies in three decades?

That's enough sequels
to rival box-office legends

like James Bond or Godzilla.

"Friday the 13th" defined

what is considered
the modern-day slasher.

Looking at this guy,
it's no wonder why.

But you know what?
It takes more than a body count

to make a "Friday the 13th" movie.

The formula is pretty specific
with a "Friday the 13th" movie.

The first thing you need
in a "Friday the 13th" film

is nubile young flesh.

You have a bunch of teenagers
and they cannot be accessible

by adult power authorities.

They can't come in
and save them.

You have to have a reason
for the kids to be out in the woods.

It's the " Let's run out
into the woods,"

and, " Ooh!
There's a killer loose."

The crazy old bastard.
(screams)

I'm the messenger of God.

You're doomed if you stay here.

These movies are made
for teenagers.

And so the point of view is
that anyone who is over a certain age

or in a position of authority
cannot be trusted,

because that's
how teenagers feel.

Steel:
They have almost, like, one

of each type of personality.

So that no matter
who you are

looking at the movie, you can
relate to one of those characters.

Cunningham: We want to have
these sort of beautiful teenagers

but which include all the stereotypes.

You know, the fat guy
and the high school jock

and the pretty cheerleader

and then the girl
with brown hair

who is sort of soulful.

The obnoxious teenager
who you just want to die so bad,

and when he dies, you all cheer.



I think every "Friday the 13th"
has to have the "promiscuous" girl

who is caught doing
something naughty

and she pays.

She's usually the first one to go.

And then they are picked off
one by one

and you have to figure out
as many different ways

of making the teenagers dumb

without being really stupid.

Because the great thing about
"Friday the 13th" and other horror films

is it gives a lot of people
in the audience a chance

to be way smarter
than the characters.

There has to be teenagers
having sex

and getting killed
while they're having sex.

Barton:
Jason likes to get you

when you're that much aroused.

It's like he takes
your sexual energy,

then he fucks you
with his machete.

For the most part,
the less sex you have,

the higher chance
you have of living.

Also has to be in the film:
a pair of breasts

every 15 minutes.

It's show time.

We were kind of short
on the breast thing, I think.

I can only count about three.

Three breasts?
We need more.

I needed the T&A for me.
To hell with the audience.

And then of course,
the important ingredient

is Jason.
(girl screaming)

Jason is an unstoppable force
of nature.

It's interesting how
he could just walk

and nobody could ever
get away from him.

It also kind of seems like
he's everywhere at once... at one time.

He notices everybody
all of a sudden

when they're just gonna
have a great time...

(imitates blade cutting)

And if you go back
and remember what it was

that caused Jason's drowning,

it was teenagers canoodling
and not watching.

If you're screwing,
you get killed.

We weren't doing anything.
We were just messing ar... ugh!

You have sex, die.
That's the premise.

That's the underlying theme

going through
the "Friday the 13th" movies.

I didn't have sex until I was 30
because of Jason.

That motherfucker was the best
contraceptive a guy like me could have.

Slasher movies particularly
are like Broadway musicals.

You can't go too long
without a song.

You can't go more than
10 minutes without a kill.

Kids went to see these movies
to see kids get killed.

The kills have to be
interesting and unique.

And even the cast,

the kids would come up to us,
"How am I gonna die?"

I think that's what
audiences came to see.

How is the next guy
gonna get it?


Help, somebody help me!

Charles: It's pure fantasy
and we know it's fantasy.

These films are better

than the gory

modern killing films

that are made
to look so realistic.

Usually at the end
of the movie there's some sort of

a jump scare.

The famous ending scene
was not in the original script.

They really didn't have
an ending so I said to Sean,

"Why don't we have Jason
jump out of the lake

and attack her?"

Lehman:
Alice has this look of hope

and she's just trailing
her fingers in the water.

And at the moment
when the strings just swell...



Bam!
That's where the trick is played.

The reason I think this has
gone is it transcends

a lot of different ages.

And the music is important

because you're sort of heightened
and scared

just with the music
and the visual all at the same time.

Music and score
is another character.

It's every bit as important
as Jason.

Harry Manfredini
took the minimalist approach

and it works
to a perfect effect.

Music in a horror movie
is crucial.

It can make or break a film,
and his score in that movie

was just untouchable.

Kill kill kill kill...

(imitating soundtrack)

(nonsense noises)

No no, that doesn't sound right.
That's not good. Let's start again.

And if you go to the end of the film,
you'll see a very close-up

of Betsy Palmer's

Mrs. Voorhees' mouth,

where she's saying

to herself, " Kill her, Mommy.
Kill her, Mommy."

And it goes back and forth
between her voice

and supposedly Jason's voice.

And I said, "Bingo, that's it."

So then I just went

and I took the consonant sound

of the K, "ki" from killer

and "ma" from mommy.

I went up
to a microphone and just went

"ki... ma."

And we ran it through
something called an echoplex,

and it ended up coming...
(imitates soundtrack)

When you hear that...
(imitates soundtrack)

you know you've got
a"Friday the 13th" movie.

It created all the conventions
of the slasher films that followed,

pretty much using the template
that was established

on that first film in 1980.

Obviously,
Jason Voorhees is a true

worldwide icon.

One could say that he's
as famous as the Beatles

or Madonna,
a veritable rock-star slasher

if there ever was one.
And what rock star

would be complete
without a greatest-hits compilation?

Does Jason have one, you ask?

Let's ask this guy.

(bones crack)
(screams)

What are you doing,
douchebag?

So Jason will kill with anything
he could get his hands on.

Lynch: It was another one
that you sit in the audience

and watch it with a crowd
and everyone just goes, "Oh, dude!"


The obvious most memorable moment
is with Kevin Bacon.

He's like on his knees
under the bed.

Me and my buddy Taso
are under there

and I'm pushing
the arrow through

and Taso was
pumping the blood,

but an accident occurred.
The tubes separated

from Taso's pump,
so he grabbed it and blew in it.

That's what made
the blood shoot out and gurgle.

My favorite kill of all:
Mrs. Voorhees slo-mo.

It doesn't get better than that.

The ultimate kill by Alice.
(screaming)

(mimics knife thrust)

We actually made a cast
of Betsy Palmer's head.

I attached it with toothpicks.

So the toothpicks
were just kind of holding it in place,

knowing that when I whacked it
with that machete,

it would go through
the toothpicks.

But if you watch the movie
when Betsy Palmer is decapitated,

her hands come up into frame
and kind of like a grabbing there.

They're Taso's hands
with hairy knuckles.

I don't have hair
on the back of my hands like he did.

I thought that was
a little weird in one shot.

One of the things that turned out
wildly effective

was the back-cracking
of the sheriff character.

(screaming)
(bones crack)

They dug a hole

and those weren't my legs.
They had a guy head down

in the hole with his legs
behind me.

But just that whole idea
of bending somebody all the way back

and hearing all this...
(knuckles crack) sound

drove them crazy.

A little sound design, a little
screaming, it all turned out great.

Wheelchair death in "Part 2,"

that was just fucked up.

He already gets your sympathy

'cause you're like,
"Oh, he's in a wheelchair."

But then he's gonna get laid.

And then Jason just goes,
"You're screwed!"

And not only does he get hit
in the face,

but he gets pushed backwards
down the stairs,

and the camera does this
great thing where it goes, "Weeee!"

(screams, gagging)
(grunts)

Bonnie Hellman:
I had a track around my neck

with a flexible steel blade
that pushed from the back

and then a false neck over it,
which took hours to put on.

Of course,
I was eating a banana

at the time, so they had my mouth
full of banana and blood.

It was such a messy little death.

Now cut that out right now.
That's not funny!

There was a cable
that was actually set up on the post

that ran across to where
she was standing.

The gun was rigged in such a way
that I actually hooked the gun

onto the cable and shot it

so it went straight
down the cable.

And in 3D with the glasses,
it's incredible.

We had to do it in one take

because the minute I hit the water,

the little prosthetic
would absorb the water

and just kind of slide off.

The hedge clippers to the eyes...

that girl had the best rack,
the best death

and her last name
really had Voorhees in it.

That was a pretty horrific
way to go.

That shish-kebab scene

is so original.

(gasps, grunts)

They attached this back to me

and then put the spear
through the latex

and had the blood
pumping out.

And they had a bed

which had a hole in it

and then she just
kind of came in, sat

and then put her head back.

It looked like I was lying
on top of her.

Before it got butchered
by the ratings board,

there was this amazing shot
where you saw the real girl

doing the last moment
that she could have

trying to push
the guy off of her.

It was such an effective
disturbing sequence.

You imagine Jason down there
like, "I can't wait."

What about the dude who goes
into a handstand

and gets the axe
right down the middle?



(muffled scream)

He took my head by force

and slammed it through
the wall of the Winnebago.

And how they actually did that
is they filmed it underwater.

They shot it in slo-mo,

pushing through
this piece of plastic.

You start asking yourself
is there something wrong with you

when you're spending your day
thinking up ways to murder people,

but I got over it.
They used a real spear.

And it missed me
by a speck.


(water gurgling)

I like it when he crushes heads.
(grunts)

We had a string
go straight to the eye

so we could just pull the string

and the eye would pop out
of the socket,

come straight
down the line toward camera.

That is horrifically gory,

but it's classic Jason.

Ryder:
My favorite kill in "Jason X"

is where he dunks
that chick's head in the ice.

We spent a lot of time on that...
prepping it.

And we not only
just storyboarded it out,

but we had to have a false sink
with the camera underneath

and a glass for the water
because I wanted to be able to see

the face come toward
the camera, not frozen.

And then...
Bam! Face salad.


That was technically
our most difficult kill.

I think his favorite thing
is smashing heads together.

My favorite Jason kill
that I've ever done

is the sleeping bag.

He bashed her against the tree,
I think, at least five times,

but we minimized it
to once.

And that was
actually more impactful.

Savini: I cut his brain in half
in "Part 4." I created the monster.

Thank you for letting me
kill the monster.

And this is...
Joseph Zito.

The...
Director of " Friday the 13th

Final Chapter."
I'm Erich Anderson and I played Rob.

And we're at the house
where we shot the movie.

This is really the site
of the death of Jason.

Right there.

Zito: We have a big
special-effects makeup group.

And they're all around.

They're all around
and they're pumping blood

and moving the tongue

and working all
of the parts.

The mask hits the ground,
and the machete is picked up here,

and Tommy ends up
taking the machete

and killing Jason
to die die die.

Girl: Tommy!

You maybe were expecting
something quick.

Tommy hits him in the head
with the blade, the end?

No, he slides down the blade.

(gagging, screaming)


Not too shabby.

But creating Jason's handiwork
is never an easy task.

Neither was creating
Jason Voorhees.

I should know.

So what does it take to create
an unforgettable movie villain?

I came up with the idea
for Jason's name

'cause originally it was
gonna be Josh,

but the more I worked
on the film and the creepier

the whole subject of that got,

I stuck with the "J"
and went to Jason.

Tommy Savini,
who of course

did all those
fabulous special effects,

gave me some Polaroids
to look at.

And he said,
"That's your son,

Jason.
He's a mongoloid."

I said, "He's what?"

His features were really a guy I used
to see in my neighborhood,

a homeless drunk guy,
one ear was lower than the other.

He was almost
a Quasimodo kind of guy.

Lehman:
The first thing they do is they take

a cast of your head.

There was fake teeth.
There was a glass eye.

One thing people often ask is,

"Was it specially made
to go underwater?"

and stuff like that.

No, it was just...

it was a latex prosthetic.

Daskawisz:
Once I put the bag over my head

and I ran in the woods,
I couldn't see anything

'cause the bag flopped
back and forth.

And he came up with this idea...
we'll put double-faced tape here

and here, and we'll hold it
right close to your eye.

This way you'll see where
you're going, and it worked great.

But from taking the tape
on and off,

I had started to develop burns
on my face.

Gillette:
First they cut off all your hair,

and then they started to build
the face with little rubber forms

they would glue on.
And they sent me to a dentist

that created dental plates
that would go in

that were sort of
the worst dental problems

anyone could ever have.

And they built the beard
and the hair,

and they taped off the eye.

It's sort of painful
to have all this stuff put on.

The scene of "Friday the 13th: 2"
where Jason

comes careening
through the window...

they built a platform
outside the house.

The platform was probably
four feet long.

So we coordinated
how many steps it takes.

So one, two, three... aggh!


At the time when this was created,
there was a serial killer

running around in Texas.

And he was killing people

with a potato sack on his head.

This could have been
the inspiration,

which I believe the potato sack
is a little scarier

than the hockey mask,

which of course
is now iconic.

Brooker: I didn't get any direction
from Steve Miner at all.

He actually came to me and said,
"You're just a mindless killer.

You're like
the living version of 'Jaws." '

I used to have to go in
and do about six,

sometimes seven hours
of makeup.

And it was 11 different appliances

that they glued to my face.

The bad part about it was
that as soon as they'd finished,

it was usually lunchtime
and I couldn't eat.

So they used to give me
Tiger's Milk through a straw.

Judie Aronson: Jason in our film
was played by Ted White.

And his way
of keeping the character

was kind of separating himself
from everybody else.

I don't remember really him having
a conversation with anybody.

I actually turned it down
to begin with,

and later on I did accept it.

After I accepted it, I did go down
and rent two of the "Jasons,"

and I watched Jason itself,

how he moved and so forth.

And I felt I'd like to play him
a little bit different.

I'd like for him
to move a little bit different.

Another way of doing it
would be the fast move,

to move faster,
and that's how I portrayed him.

That's what I wanted to do
with him.

Even when I was in full costume,
makeup, everything,

I stayed away
from the cast completely.

I'd sit by myself on the set.

I just stayed away
from everybody.

And I tried to keep in character
as much as possible.

I liked the mystique

of being by myself,

not being close to anybody.

The scene upstairs where
they hit me over the head

with a television set,

little did I know that that
TV set was gonna stay on my head.

I had no idea where I was.
I couldn't see out of that thing.

It was just a hand feeling
for the stairway.

You know, I was offered
the fifth one and sixth one.

I could have done either one of them
and I turned 'em down.

I'm sorry now
that I did turn them down.

Morga: In "5," I actually
played an impostor of Jason,

and I did have a couple moments
where I did

play the apparition

of Jason himself,

where those were supposedly
different Jason characters.

I just played Jason
through the whole movie.

In the film, obviously,
they had to distinguish in some way

so they used the blue
for the marks on the mask

for the impostor Jason,
where when I did the actual Jason

I was wearing the real mask

with the red marks on it.

The makeup with this particular
character wasn't too intense.

The Jason character, though,

was a pullover mask
with the face cut out.

All they had to do
was darken my eyes

and then put the hockey mask
over it.

We never talked about this.
It's really not in the script.

Any motivation...
there isn't any.

So I felt Roy was a little disturbed
to begin with.

The first time I put on
the green jumpsuit

and the boots

and I zipped them up,
I looked at myself in the mirror

and I thought, "Is this me?"

Bartalos:
One of the exciting things for me

was the creation of Jason's mask.

So we took a hockey mask

and kind of customized it.

We basically redesigned

some of the ventilation holes.

We created basically
a new positive.

From the positive, we made
a big block rubber mold

and from that,
created what's called a buck,

a heavy-duty cement wedge that

on the top
of it has the veneer

of the hockey mask

At that point,
using a real heavy duty plastic,

we did what's called
vacuforming.

The vacuforming draws apart

and we pull it out and bang,

we get Jason's mask.

C.J. Graham: When we portrayed it,
he got stronger.

Every opportunity
of a fight scene or a kill

enhanced his knowledge
of killing or his strength.

Every time he was shot and put down,
he came back stronger the next time.

You know, Tom was very adamant.
He did not want a machine on stage.

When you were on set,
he wanted to make sure

there was some human contact

and people could relate to it.

Jason just is indestructible.
When you put the costume on,

you really project it, and the
projection had to be through the body...

100% through the body.
Just a simplistic little movement

would create fear.

As soon as the mask
comes down,

it's very simple
to get into the character.

Nice thing about it
is you get to kill 17, 18 people,

you don't go to prison.

Buechler:
Every scar, every rip, every tear

that Jason ever had was

in the Jason
that we created for "Part VII."

As far as playing the character,
I wanted to just do what felt natural.

My goal was
to just add some more life

to the character,
even though he is kind of a zombie.

People ask me, " Why does
the makeup change so much

from movie to movie? The hockey mask
changes and everything else."

Basically, it's because it's
a different makeup-effects person

who designs it.

The first movie I did,
"Part VII,"

the makeup was real extensive,
many pieces.

It took about three
and a half hours a day.

It was hard to work in,
but fantastic makeup.

Über Jason...
it was an entire

one-piece suit

that did have a zipper
in the back, but very well concealed.

On the suit,
it limited my motion a lot

with the arm and the leg

that had the metallic pieces.

I still love the design
of that Über Jason mask.

He brought a lot to the role.

No matter who directed him,
no matter what movie he was in,

you could tell Kane's Jason
from other people's Jason.

Having Kane Hodder
play Jason four times

really established him
as Jason.

I think stepping into it,
I was a little leery,

because a lot of the feedback
the fans were putting out there

was negative, I think,
in the beginning.

But then when the movie
came out,

it became very very positive.

They were big shoes,
but I'm a big guy.

I remember the first day
he showed up on the set,

the first night we shot him,
and I turned around,

and there he was in full glory.

I mean, his boots were
like this thick,

and then you put on
everything else that he's wearing

and he was 6'8 ".

I'm not kidding you,
he scared the hell out of me.

My portrayal of Jason

showed another side
that you don't normally get to see.

In "Freddy vs. Jason,"
you see him actually interact

with his mother,
and you see him confronted by fears.

I just went back
to my childhood,

and I think I thought
a lot about Frankenstein...

not really alive,
but not really dead.

Even if you look at the movements,
the walk and stuff like that,

I think I used a little bit
of Frankenstein.

Even though people think
he just kind of stands there

and lumbers along
with his machete,

you have to feel
that there's a physical force

that could actually be as evil
and as powerful as he is.

Ew! Sorry, buddy.

I hope it was over quickly.

The truth is,
like this guy,

most people don't survive
their encounter

with our murderous mongoloid.

Still, there have been a few
that gave Jason quite a headache.

You know, the people that insist
on not going down without a fight.

It's a small group,

but they certainly gave Jason
a big run for his money.

Or his machete.

So whether it's Alice or it's Ginny
or it's Chris or any of these girls

who make it to the end, they usually
have some common characteristics.

The most important
is their chastity,

their purity.

They're generally not there
to just party.

And as a result,
they get rewarded

by being able
to live through it.

It was usually the outcast.
It was usually the good girl,

the one who didn't smoke pot,
who didn't have premarital sex.

She was always the one
who was able to take him on.

And I think that goes back
to the most primitive storytelling

of just good versus evil.

The archetypes for them are
the innocent girl next door.

I never felt like a victim.

As a matter of fact,
I felt very empowered by the role.

The women were stronger
in this film than the guys were.

She's a typical, regular gal.

She's like any teenager

or young adult trying

to figure out what they
wanna do with their life.

She didn't run with the pack

and she was different.

But that didn't mean
she was virtuous.

It just meant she thought things
through differently.

I would love the opportunity
to come back.

It's so much more satisfying

to watch a woman

destroy this tremendous evil.

Amy Steel, she was just so adorable.
She was so girl-next-doorish.

She would probably be
my all-time favorite "Friday" girl.

To know that I did one
of these films

where they get all these women in
that are so vulnerable

and to be the one that
people think was strong

and intelligent is just...
it feels good.

Ginny was written

in a more multidimensional
kind of way.

And there was something a little bit
separate about her than everybody.

She didn't need a group
of people around her.

She was strong enough
to stand on her own.

She wanted to figure it out.

Well, what would it be like today?

Some kind of
out-of-control psychopath?

A frightened retard?

A child trapped
in a man's body?

I think my favorite personally
was Lar Park-Lincoln in "Part VII."

Just the ability
to come in with the mind

and to manipulate Jason like she did...
I mean, she was equal.

Roday: The genius convention
of adding a character

with telekinesis

to give Jason
a new sort of foil

in the final battle
was pretty fantastic.

One thing that I didn't want
to do is I didn't want

to play a psychic, or someone
who felt they had telekinetic abilities,

like they were someone
going into a stroke

and doing some
cartoonish version

of what
she was dealing with.

Lar Park-Lincoln as Tina,
she's classic.

It was a different take
on the story.

That character gave it
a great brawl.

Park-Lincoln: She didn't back down.
She never really ran from him.

She chased him.
And we had that great street scene

where she goes right up
to him... I love the twigs

coming around his legs

and taking him down
that way.

The most worthy opponents
of Jason

from the movies that I did...
certainly Tina has to be there,

because she created
the most damage

to Jason and survived.

They also started a trend where like
the surviving girl's "love interest"

started making it through
as well.

I'm honored that I was a survivor.

If Jason wanted
to bring it on again,

I'd come back.

I would love
to tackle her again.

Although I think I would do it
with better hair serum.

So my hair
wouldn't be as frizzy

as it was throughout
the entire shooting of that film.

I think of the whole series,
I think Tommy Jarvis is probably one

of Jason's biggest adversaries.

Jason, don't you remember?

Remember, Jason?

Zito:
Tommy's an outsider, like Jason.

Tommy's a kid
that doesn't fit in.

So there is a relationship
between Tommy and Jason

when Tommy takes on
the persona and impersonates him

as a weapon to undo him.

I would love to have gone up
against Corey Feldman

just 'cause I'd like
to squeeze his head until it pops.

Tommy had a very unique
relationship to Jason

because at least at the end
of "Part 5," he actually

looks like he will become
the next Jason.

In "Part 4," which Corey Feldman
played so beautifully,

he ends up
in an insane asylum.

Is he monster or victim?
Well, he's a little bit of both.

He just wants to kill everybody.

He didn't get me though.
I ran him over with a tractor...

one of the very few brothers
that survived

the "Friday the 13th" series,
by the way.

They wanted
to kill me off in "Part VI,"

but we said,
"Nope, not doing that to us."


John LeMay's character...
another good one

because we had
a hell of a fight.

I did put up
a pretty good fight.

The electricity's going off
everywhere,

and I'm just breathing heavy
and sweating a lot

and smacking the hell out
of him. It was fun,

but surviving Jason is an honor.

In my obituary,
it'll say " John survived Jason,

but could not survive life."

Daggett: Rennie had
a special connection to Jason

because I think her evil uncle

was trying to teach her how
to swim when she was a little girl.

Peter Mark Richman:
I tossed her in the water,

which was a not-very-nice thing
to do for an uncle.

And she had
an inordinate fear

of drowning.

And she saw Jason
under the water.


I felt very empowered
playing the part, especially at the end

when I was the only one surviving
and there we were in the sewers.

And I felt like,

"All right,
this is a nice, tough,

accurate portrayal
of a girl's strength."

You didn't get me in the lake,

and you're not
gonna get me now!

I would probably go back
and do another "Friday the 13th."

If nothing else,
then just to make my boys happy.

Women in "Friday the 13th" movies

are always strong.
You know, they're strong characters.

And we wanted
to be true to that.

So Todd and I came up
with this idea of this robot

and making the robot female.

One of the most delightful things
about her

is like just unstoppable,
unflappable.

I feel very privileged in that
I got to survive that movie.

Even though he knocked
my block off and I was a head...

I was a talking head

for, I think, the last third
of the movie...

I feel like one
of the lucky ones.

I think most of the people
that have survived

have been women
because all of us directors

have a tremendous
amount of guilt

for what we've done
to all of these poor girls

in the movies.

I do think that the heroines
have a strength that's there,

but a real vulnerability

that attracts people.

People wanna love you
and they wanna cheer for you.

Steel:
If they were to ask me

to do sort of
the "Friday the 13th" survivors...

gonna take on Jason...
would I do it?

Hell yeah!

Wouldn't it be great

if the strong women
of the series came back

and took him on?

It would be great... so maybe
Adrienne and Lar and myself.

I think that it would be very
interesting if you had a triad

of the girls,
where you would have the powers,

an extremely strong one
and just a ballsy character.

It would be a dream movie for the fans.
And I think we could still pull it off.

We still have a couple
of good years in us.

Jason? Where's Jason?!

We took care of him.

(siren wails)


Please please
please, help me.

(girl screaming)

Yeah, bad luck
sure can be bloody.

It's not just the victims
on the screen that run into problems.

Over the past 30 years
there have been troublesome times

for the "Friday the 13th"
filmmakers as well.

Many had nothing
whatsoever to do

with our hockey-masked friend.

Paul?

Shooting my death scene
was a bit of a challenge.

That's where
the horror part came

into the filming with me.

From here down,
I was in the water.

There were points
where I just felt

like I couldn't go on anymore.

It was either 22 or 23º.
It was very very cold

and she had a bikini on
and she was freezing.

She was so cold
her teeth were chattering,

and this girl
was actually turning blue.

Aronson:
Ted White stood up for me

and demanded that we

get the shot now or else.

And it turns out that I had
gotten hypothermia,

and I was quite sick

for several days after that.

LeMay: A whole day spent
filming the end of the movie

where Jason's getting
sucked into the earth

and trying to drag me down
with him.

On the soundstage, they'd pretty
much created this large sandbox

with a hole in it,
which Jason would pop up,

grab me by the leg
and keep pulling me down.

And for some reason
that sequence took a half a day

with me screaming
at the top of my lungs

and just wearing my body out.

I thought every shot was gonna
be the last dang one, you know?

I thought it was it.
"We got this one, baby."

I don't think I've ever
been so exhausted in my life.

Man: Now, dirt demons,
everything up, moving.

Al Magliochetti:
The visual-effects climax,

all these demons came up
from below the ground

and started grabbing Jason
and trying to pull him down into hell.

And KNB had a very elaborate
sequence designed for that,

with all kinds of puppets.
And we had a very elaborate miniature...

which wound up not being used
because of technical problems...

that actually grabbed Jason

and started dragging him under.

Isn't that cool?
How many people get this going on?

On the final day of production

I got my action figure...

made by the hair
and makeup guys.

So this is my one-of-a-kind
action figure.

We shot the ending twice.

We actually did
another ending,

which most people
have never seen,

in which Dana Kimmell
comes up to the door

of the house in a dream,

and Jason comes
through the front door

and decapitates her.

This is the actual mask that
was done on my skin.

It's a little...

oh, here's a worm.

It's a little crumbly,
but it's split up the back

because as it was on my face
all the way around my neck...

I had a bald cap on...

they did the whole thing
right on my head.

And so to get me out of it,
they split it right up the back.

So it used to be something
like this, but...

Monoson:
My parents are away in the movie...

I had to be stoned.

And so I thought,
"Hmm, wouldn't that be interesting

to actually be stoned
on camera?"

So I go to my trailer
and I get stoned.

I'm a very paranoid
stoned person.

So it was the worst worst idea
I could have ever done.

And they knocked on my door
to go to the set.

I'm like, "What?!"
And they're like, "We're ready for you,"

and I'm like, "Okay."

So they take me
and I'm on the set,

and, actors,
don't get stoned and act.

It's absolutely the worst thing.

I was out of my mind.

Richman:
I do remember a scene

in my bedroom
where this girl comes on to me,

and I was getting
very keyed up,

turned on.

In the editing
they didn't show any of that.

And I was pissed off.

I was really...

having it affect me.

The MPAA really went after
the "Friday the 13th" films,

'cause they were asleep
when the first film was rated.

They kind of let it pass.
When the sequels came out,

and after all the criticism,
they had to be more stringent.

Probably the most heavily edited
was "Part VII."

The MPAA was just vicious
toward that film for some reason.

Ratings board raped my movie.

I equate horror

to telling a joke.

Everything's in the setup
and then the payoff

has gotta be,
"Whoa, that's great!"

We were telling the joke
and we weren't allowed

to give them the punchline.

So what you see

in the final cut of "Friday VII,"

which is not really my cut,
is a very watered-down version

of what we hoped it would be.

Rotten:
The MPAA was just responding

to a lot of parent advocate groups
that were coming out of the woodwork.

I mean, you had parents picketing
out in front of theaters

for certain films sometimes.

I think the MPAA gets crazy
when you combine sex and violence

at the same time, so I think that's
something you have to be careful about.

All the sequels
really went through the wringer

to secure R ratings.

Steinmann:
The MPAA,

after a lot heavy-duty fights,

insisted that we omit
47 seconds.

Almost every kill

was either off-screen

or minimized.

Ross: Tiffany Helm, there was a scene
that nobody knows about,

where she had her death scene.
I think they had to change it

because it would have
been rated X if they kept it.

Jason was gonna
go in for the kill.

Tiffany was gonna have
her legs up like this,

and he was just gonna go like...
couldn't show that.

Couldn't show that back then.
That was cut. Rated X.

X. Shoot it.

King: "Friday the 13th" was
the greatest experience for me,

and then slowly I realized

I had a stalker.

I had an ordeal with him
up close at one point,

which in itself
is a horror movie.

It's all okay now.
It's all good now.

And having
the three generations

of fans from
around the world that fly in

to wherever I am
at a city or a convention

that really talk to me
and care and tell me how much

it affected them
when they found out...

it's just a gift.

It's a beautiful thing and I don't
care how sappy it sounds.

I thank them.

Steel:
One of the scary moments on the set

was in Jason's lair

when I put the sweater on

and I talked to him
about Mother.

And he's supposed

to bring up this pickaxe.

So I got really anxious

and I brought the machete down.

She missed the pickaxe,

and she came down
on my finger.

Steel:
And he goes to the hospital...

I think he had the machete
through his chest or something

and walks into
the emergency room

and they're like, "Oh my God!"

Then he said, " No no,
it's just right here on my finger."

And I have 13 stitches
in this finger.

It's right here.
This right here, it's 13 stitches.

And then he came back

and we started all over again.

We stayed at the camp. At one
of our first nights in the cabins...

I think it was John Furey
and Bill Randolph

and Russell Todd...

knew where I was staying.

And they went
to the screen windows

when it was really dark out

and they started scratching
on the screen windows.

I fainted.
I actually fainted

flat on the floor

'cause I just went... (gasps)
Boom!

(rock music playing)

Though the counselors
at Crystal Lake

worked very hard to keep
the rules of the camp clear,

the same can't be said
for the "Friday the 13th" films,

which have had more
than their share of ambiguities

and inconsistencies,

leaving the fans longing
for more.

Oh, no way, Becca.

You so owe me a Wonderbra.
(giggles)

Well, okay.

Strip Monopoly's
so much fun.

Oooh!

Camp Crystal Lake rocks.

One of the things
that the "Friday" series

never really took pride in
was continuity.

How could it be Friday the 13th
if "2," "III" and "4"

are within three or four days?

I don't think Monday the 16th

has quite the same ring to it.

Cohen:
People send me Jason timelines

and show me categorically
where I'm wrong about certain things,

and where the writer of "VI" was wrong,
or the writer of "III" was wrong.

And you know what, so what?
I just don't know.

King:
The fans have told me

at convention after convention

that they felt "ripped off"

about the way Alice died
in "Part 2."

She didn't even see him.
It's like it could have been anyone.

As far as I'm concerned,
it was somebody else.

If Jason is who I believe he is

and who I think the fans
think he is,

it's not like he can look
her number up in the phonebook.

It's not like she would be listed
in the phonebook.

She got away.
But in the second one

he comes to her apartment
and kills her?

Now what I want to know is
how did Jason get a plane ticket?

There was a "Friday the 13th"
TV series.

LeMay:
The only thing that the series

and the movies

had in common
was the title.

It turns out it was about
people trying

to retrieve cursed artifacts

from a pawnshop.

I think a lot of people who were
really big fans of the series

didn't like the fact
that they stole the name

and tried to sneak a fast one
past everybody.

So beginning with "Part III,"

when Jason finds the mask

that everyone identifies
with him,

there's been some debate
over the years about

how that happened.

And the one thing that
everybody likes to take credit for

is who put the hockey mask
on Jason.

One day we were doing
makeup tests

on "Friday the 13th Part III."

So just for the 3D concept,

I must admit, in modesty,

that I put the hockey mask
on Jason.

I don't care
what anybody says.

They weren't gonna use that bag again
based on what happened

to me with the burns.
They had to come up with another idea.

That's why they came up
with the hockey mask.

I believe it was Peter Schindler

and Marty Becker were
Detroit hockey fans.

And it was their idea
to come up with a hockey mask

to cover the face up.

Every time
kids come to my door

wearing
the Jason hockey mask,

I figure, " Wow, this is
another 50¢ I didn't get."

They're all still bickering
about it, but you heard it here...

mine.

Katz: The end of
"Friday the 13th Part 2" is still

one of the most confusing endings
of that series.

Probably easily the most,
other than the toxic-waste

version of teenaged Jason.

Paul! Where's Paul?

For me, it wasn't a dream.

Maybe that's one
of the good parts of the movie

is that you get to decide that
for yourself.

On "Freddy vs. Jason,"
they went a different direction

with casting Jason

and didn't cast Kane Hodder.

And I was really surprised.

I really wanted to use Kane
and then Ronnie Yu decided

that he really kind of
liked this other guy.

And he was directing
the movie and I said, "Fine."

It was a shame at some level
that Kane didn't get to do it.

About our clothes, I mean...

that's slightly the weirdest thing
about our roles,

which were supposed
to be these sexy girls

and we're dressed
in these ghastly clothes.

Camilla More:
What about our hair as well?

Our hair put up in sort
of little librarian buns.

I mean, hello.

And the pink puffy shirts
with the shoulder pads.

Lynch: It's kind of like
Springfield for " The Simpsons."

It's like, where is Crystal Lake?
It would be nice to find out someday

where is this Crystal Lake,
'cause I'd like to go there and swim.

I can definitively answer
the question of where is Crystal Lake.

Crystal Lake is in
Green Valley, New Jersey.

And the reason we know that
is because in "Part III,"

Shelly and Vera go
to a country store

and in the store,
you can see in the back,

it says " Welcome to Green Valley,
New Jersey." Case closed.

Katz: "Jason Takes Manhattan"...
outside of having one of the great

teaser posters of all time,
which of course was then discontinued,

ultimately, the "I Heart New York,"

that's actually something
that's trademarked

by probably, I'm guessing,
the tourism bureau, if memory serves,

and that's actually a very valuable
license to them, ultimately.

Crystal Lake has changed sizes.
Somehow the boat gets

from this tiny little lake
to the Atlantic Ocean

to New York.

The cruise ship wasn't really
in the lake.

The cruise ship was on the ocean.
In my mind, I had it justified,

because I've seen places where
you can go from a lake to the ocean.

And we ultimately just said,
"No, let's forget it.

People may get mad at us for that,
but let's go for it."

Body switching
in "Jason Goes to Hell,"

I think that was a terrible
terrible decision.

Roday:
The fact that Jason turned into a slug

in "Part 9"...unacceptable.

Gordon.

The most rational character
in the entire

"Friday the 13th" series
is the dog in "Part 4."

You don't know whether Jason grabbed
the dog and threw him out the window.

The dog sees Jason
and the next shot is the dog

apparently jumping
through the window.

There was a big fight over
whether we could kill the dog.

I think he jumped,
but I was hoping

some people will
think Jason did it.

Maybe Tina from "VII" telekinetically
yanked the dog out the window.

Well, he was bound
to catch up with her... sooner or later.

If there's one thing
that we've learned

it's escaping Jason
is a rarity.

Over the last three decades,
his reign of terror

has gone beyond
the silver screen.

In fact, it's clear that Jason

has done more
than take Manhattan.

In fact, I'd say
he's conquered the world.

(gears grind)

Oh! That had to hurt.

Interestingly enough,

Jason did manage
to infiltrate the pop culture

in a big big way.
And I think that all started

with "Part III" in 3D.

I have the home-theater glass set,

so you can see it and watch it
and people would walk into my house

and I have them on,
and be like, " Hey, what's up?

I'm watching
'Friday the 13th Part III." '

Graham: From a merchandising
perspective, it's huge.

I cannot believe
the branding of Jason.

He is no less marketable
than Ronald McDonald

or Mickey Mouse at this point.

Jason is making money.

I mean, does he get
a percentage of the sales?

I'm very curious.

Jason Voorhees has been
mass marketed over the years,

starting with this Nintendo game
back in the early '80s.

Adam Green:
That was the worst game ever.

All you did is run around the cabins. And
there'd be like nothing, nothing,

Jason's in here! I'm dead.

My name's James Rolfe.
I have an internet show...

"The Angry Video Game Nerd."

The "Friday the 13th" episode
made its debut

on Friday the 13th,
October 2006.

Uh-oh, he's coming. Whoa!

Well, he scared the shit out
of me and now he's fighting me

like in " Mike Tyson's
Punch-Out!!"

They've created a hero image

of an individual that's unstoppable.

He's this super slasher hero.

There's no rhyme or reason,
you know?

He's been on lunchboxes
and thermoses,

and I think he was
in a Nike commercial.

(screams)
(pants)

Those I believe were banned
or pulled from the market.

There's been countless TV shows
that have parodied "Friday the 13th,"

from "MADtv."
Man: Jason Takes NASA.

Yeah, we've done a bunch
of "Friday the 13th" parodies.

The first thing we did was
a"Horror Movie Big Brother."

(chainsaw whirring)

We did a Scooby gang
investigates the mystery

of Camp Crystal Lake.
Zoinks!

When it gets referenced
on "The Simpsons"

or "South Park," that's like
your proudest moment.

Run!

I love the fact that "The Simpsons"
have Jason and Freddy.

They should be here by now.
Ah, what are you gonna do?

(switches channel)
When he got that MTV Movie Award,

it was absolutely invigorating
for all the fans

and also it was like, " Where have
we landed exactly as a society?"

We're giving a Lifetime
Achievement Award

to a masked predator.

Shortly after we did
"Jason Takes Manhattan,"

I was asked to do
"The Arsenio Hall Show"

in costume as a guest.

He pulled the whole interview off
by talking to someone who doesn't speak.

How are you?

That's good.
One of the rare things I've ever done

in full costume
besides the movie.

Miska:
Snow globes,

there's dolls,

there's even a haunted house
at Universal Studios in Florida

and in Hollywood.

One of the greatest thrills
that I've had as a Jason fan

was going to the Universal
Horror Nights last year.

Jason Voorhees is running after you.
It's a real guy

in the whole costume.
I kind of pooped my pants a little bit.

Hi, I'm John Murdy,
creative director of Universal Studios'

Hollywood's Halloween Horror Nights
and right now we are standing

in front of the Crystal Lake cabin
from "Friday the 13th: Camp Blood."

When you're designing
a haunted attraction like this,

there's basically three things
you look for.

One is that the property has legs.

Second is that
the characters are something

that you can achieve with actors,
and the third is that the environments

are strong and easily recognizable.
And "Friday the 13th" has all three.

So we were very lucky
when we worked with New Line,

we were able to get
all three of those properties

and basically turn our theme park
into a living horror movie.

In this case, he's got
a poor victim stuck in this vise.

His head's in the vise. Jason
comes in and gives the vise a crank.

We have a triggered audio effect
that sounds like his bones

in his skull are crushing,

and we tied this
into water spritz effect

so that the guests think "eye goo"

is shooting out
of the victim onto them.

This is for the wheelchair victim
that has the machete in his head.

Again, there's a secret door
for Jason back here

so he can make
a dramatic entrance,

and this poor guy
that you think is dead leaps to life.

When you're designing an attraction like
"Friday the 13th: Camp Blood,"

for us, what we really want
to do is we wanna deliver

to the fans
all their favorite kills

from the "Friday the 13th" series.

So this is a kill
from "Freddy vs. Jason."

This is the guy who gets
his back broken in half.

There's a performer that's laying here
with his head against the bed.

Jason comes storming
into the room.

He grabs hold of the bed, and he gives
it a good... (makes squashing sound)

With Jason,
they made countless toys.

Every year
there's new editions coming out.

The McFarlane stuff
and the Mezco stuff,

they all look great.
They're really well-sculpted,

articulated, awesome looking.
They're well-painted.

Who would have thought
there would be Jason dolls?

There was a great book
that came out a couple of years ago:

"Crystal Lake Memories"
about "Friday the 13th."

Peter Bracke did a great job.

He interviewed a lot of us
in the series,

from producers, directors
to actors, of course.

And it covers the series
from A to Z.

It was so fun to have come
to the book signing

and to see all the people

that are now a part of

this whole "Friday the 13th"
phenomenon.

It was a party for the launch

of the "Crystal Lake Memories" book,

and we signed all
of the books.

And then of course
Jason showed up

and cut the cake
with a machete,

and that was awfully fun.

An iconic brand
has been built.

Everybody knows Jason.

Everybody, all ages.

It's all over the world.

At Halloween,
there's always gonna be some kid

down the hall
wearing a hockey mask.

There's at least one kid
who comes down your street

who is Jason Voorhees,

and the funny thing is
he's up there with Santa Claus

in the sense
that everybody knows who it is.

Jason is a big icon.

I had a trick-or-treater
come to my house...

a little kid dressed as Jason.

And I went,
"I worked with him."

And the kid kind of looked at me
like he didn't understand.

And I asked my nephew,
'cause he's 13,

I said, "What is that?"
He goes, "That's the Jason mask."

And I said, " You know
I'm in one of those movies?"

And he said, " Oh, I've never
seen any of those movies,

but I know all about Jason."

In hindsight, it seems silly
there wouldn't be a backlash.

The critics were outraged.

Gene Siskel launched a letter-writing
campaign to Paramount.

"Friday the 13th:
The Final Chapter,"

an immoral and reprehensible
piece of trash...

When Roger Ebert said
that "Friday the 13th" was

"an immoral and reprehensible
piece of trash,"

I thought, " Two thumbs up.
Gotta see it." (laughs)

Kratka:
There's just so much in our culture

that gets labeled things
unnecessarily

or just unjustifiably.

And I think "Friday the 13th" s
were just...

they're scary movies.

As film critics,
shame on them for not appreciating

the fact that they are
artistic entertainment vehicles

for a very defined demographic.

We have fun reading reviews.
We know what they're gonna be like,

and especially if someone gets
particularly bitchy and clever,

it's great. In a way it's sort of like
the "Friday the 13th" movie itself:

if they're clever in the way
they're trying to kill you, you cheer.

What's more appealing
than forbidden fruit?

That's the oldest story
that there is.

So when you say
to a young 13-year-old,

"You can't go see that movie, young man.
It's a piece of immoral trash,"

I'm pretty confident that's the first
thing the 13-year-old's gonna go do.

As long as nobody's going out
and doing nothing crazy...

they never had to put
"Don't try this at home"

on the screen... so it's all fun.

It's not attracting psychos to it.

It really does attract

a very respectful
group of people.

Jason can survive anything,
even bad reviews.

If you're taking these films
too seriously,

you should probably
go have a Valium

or do something else.

I started the Screamfest
Horror Film Festival in 2001

as a platform to give
independent filmmakers a way

to further their careers and have
their work be shown to the industry.

I think some of the films
that we've screened in Screamfest

definitely have been influenced
by "Friday the 13th."

Most recently I would say
Adam Green's "Hatchet."

I think almost any slasher movie

post-"Friday the 13th"

kind of tipped their hat to it.

It's a great independent film.
And it's great to look back

and... what?
20-some-odd years later

to look back and see young filmmakers,
like an Adam, up and coming,

to have a film that's reminiscent
of "Friday the 13th."

So it's kind of cool.

I've been to a million conventions

and I see people
with Jason tattoos.

It's a lot of fun.

Come on, it's beautiful.

We bleed for this shit.

The fans are open to creating
their own mythology

about them too.

Man: He had just received
a surprise postcard from Jason,

inviting him to take part
in a slayathon.

Jason doesn't have a star
on the walk of fame.

This is terrible.
He's been around for 30 years

and he can't get a star?

Jason is a star!


Oh, sorry.
I didn't know anybody

was using this room.

(girl screaming)

Okay, I admit it.
I love this stuff.

But as we've seen,
so do millions of others.

I mean, after all a good killer
is never out of style, right?

Which is exactly why the original
terrifying legend

of Jason Voorhees
is being reimagined

and repackaged
for a whole new generation of fans.

It's exciting to see Jason up
to his old tricks.

(girl screaming)

So now after all of this time,

playing around with Jason

for all these years,

there comes a new look,
a new feel hopefully

in this new reimagining

or reboot of the franchise.

I hope the fans will enjoy it
from the same point of view

I enjoyed it from, which is

to see Jason

for the first time again.

To be able to work
with Jason Voorhees

and to see that mask...
I can tell you the first day

that he wore that mask on set,
we all got chills.

It was amazing,
and it was amazing to think

that here's this thing
that we've grown up with,

and it's right here
and we can touch it and feel it,

because when we watched it as kids,
it felt so far away.

It's made by people
who love the franchise,

but who are going at it
with many more resources

than we ever had
or ever dreamed of.

This remake centers
around this brother-sister story

between the Whitney character
and the Clay character,

which is played by Jared Padalecki.
It doesn't go so well.

There's enough characters in there
to actually bring some comedy into it,

so there's gonna be
obviously the crazy deaths.

They've already said
there's 13.

They've already said that,
so I'm not giving away anything,

but along with the deaths, you might have
some other lighter moments,

and it's gonna be a good contrast.

What I think makes
this one unique

is Jason being
more humanistic

and not sort of that
supernatural zombie.

He's a person.
We are coming into a time now

where everyone
is becoming more emotional

and in touch with their feelings.
So we give Jason this backstory,

and I feel like people can relate
to him more,

which almost makes the killings
and the deaths seem justified.

I think there's more heart involved.

That I think is exciting,
'cause it's a new face of Jason.

And you have to figure out
how to recreate

and keep renewing
this franchise.

And they've taken
sort of the best elements

of the first four
and wrapped it into one.

What the fans can expect to see
from the new "Friday the 13th"

is the best aspects
of the films they loved in the past

taken out and mixed up

and put into a brand-new film
for everybody.

I think they're gonna see
the intensity.

They're gonna see
over-the-top brutal kills.

We really strived to give audiences
kills that they hadn't seen before,

or, and maybe better,

kills they had seen
but we added something else to the kill.

And something else
that was in the original

that really hasn't been
in any horror movies lately,

our movie has a ton
of nudity in it.

They're gonna see
over-the-top

unique sex scenes.

It's gonna be an entertaining

wild roller-coaster of a ride.

We've gone to great lengths

to make the movie
feel very authentic,

to be very respectful
to the character.

I think this film is gonna
greatly satisfy all the genre fans,

not just the hardcore
"Friday the 13th" fans.

It's not only remarkably scary,

but very very funny.

The mythology will stay intact.

Jason is still Jason.

Our hope is that
the true fans

love the film as much as people
who've never seen the movie before.

We're hopeful
that all of our attempts

at authenticity
will have paid off for them,

and we suspect that they will,
but you never know.

I think, regardless,
they're gonna be pulled in,

and that's that.

I'm excited to be a part of this...

colossal franchise.

To just be a part of the name
"Friday the 13th" is

a little exhilarating
I have to say.

We all love Jason Voorhees.
I mean, who doesn't?

Reggie will kick his butt. Reggie
the reckless will kick Jason's butt now.

I will put the red suit on,
and I will whip Jason's behind.

I ain't playing.
We can only hope that the people

who loved "Friday the 13th"
in the first place will be satisfied

with this newer, slicker,
kind of cooler version

of the story.
On the other hand,

I think that you're gonna have people
that are gonna see this new version

as the first "Friday the 13th"
they ever saw.

And this will hopefully

set a new level of quality

so that the franchise
can continue forward.

(insects chirping)
(owl hooting)

Excuse me, miss,
is this yours?

I think you dropped...

she won't be needing this.

Over the years,
it's been the unstoppable Jason

that's kept moviegoers flocking
to theaters for a bloody good time,

but it's not just the fans
who appreciate

Jason's never-ending
reign of terror.

"Friday the 13th" has
had a life of its own.

It's quite amazing.

There are people
who just love this genre.

The "Friday the 13th" films
are an E ticket ride.

And I think people are constantly
ready to pay up for that ride.

On the night of its opening,
my wife said, "Let's go out to see it."

We went to six theaters that night,

and we couldn't get in.

We couldn't get in anywhere.
And I said to my wife,

"Holy cow, I think we really
did something here."

When I tell them
that I was in "Friday the 13th,"

it's so fun for me.

Thanks to "Friday the 13th,"

my 15 minutes keeps going.

Playing a character
that's known around the world

is an amazing feeling

and something
I'm really proud of.

There's really no putting
your finger on it,

but there seems to be a loyalty

and a fascination with it
that just drives it forward.

It's really the audience

that brings Jason back
to life every time.

The legend grows
from picture to picture to picture.

People like getting scared.
They don't know what's gonna happen.

They're just gonna wait... oh!

It surprises me
from time to time

just about how

the "Friday the 13th"
movies continue

and just go on and on. The
characters die, but the movie doesn't.

When you do "The Final Chapter,"
you expect for it

to be the final chapter.

This was the last one.
We were doing the very last one.

"The Final Friday,"

and I remember people saying
it's not gonna be the final "Friday."

That was 1992.

I get three, four, five
requests a week

for autographs and pictures
and so on from all over the world.

People still contact me.
They contact me about things

from the film
that I forgot about.

People send me things to sign...
big long posters.

I'm like,
"How did they get this?"

"Friday the 13th" has given me
a gift that

is just bigger than life itself.

I get the most beautiful stories

about how Alice's strength
has inspired

so many people
around the world.

I was 27 years old
and I was the lead in a movie.

Number-one-box-office movie
at Paramount for two weekends.

This was the best
first acting gig I could have gotten.

Because when you have a knife
coming at you,

you really learn how
to hit your mark.

I hope the audience is
having as much fun watching this

as we are making it.
Personally, it was an honor...

still is an honor
to be associated with it.

And it's really
great entertainment,

so I think that's
why he's still around.

I think the audience
wants to see more Jason

the same way that
they want to see more Bond.

The same way they want
to see more Batman.

I've found that
a movie that I really

didn't give 2¢ for

in the beginning
has brought me

into the world,
into the lives of people

who have viewed it
in a very special way.

Did you know that
a young boy drowned?

The counselors weren't
paying any attention.

His name was Jason.

Well, there you have it...
"Friday the 13th,"

a movie that was made
to keep filmmakers' lights on,

but made America
afraid to turn them off.

And one that singlehandedly
gave birth

to modern slasher cinema,

generating box office success
beyond anybody's wildest dreams.

You know,
"Friday the 13th" continues to inspire

and influence
emerging filmmakers

who try to capture
their own lightning in a bottle.

And on top of that,
I can probably proclaim

that Jason Voorhees
is a pop-culture icon

recognized the world over.

So here we are.
It's three decades later,

and "Friday the 13th" lives on.

And it's because of you
that Jason Voorhees

keeps coming back
to terrify audiences.

So let me return the favor.
I'll give you some advice.

If somebody invites you
to Camp Crystal Lake,

just don't go. (grunts)


You see what I mean?

My bad. Sorry.

(imitating soundtrack)

It's supposed to be...
"ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma."

Not everybody knows that.
True, but that's the way it sounds.

I showed them how I can fart
"ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma,"

but the camera
wasn't rolling,

so yeah.

(rock music playing)

I think if Vera had...
(screams)


Excuse me.

I thought it was Jason.

Kill her, Mommy!
Kill her!

And he's still there.

There's somebody
in this fucking room!

Why do you do
these stupid things?

I just want you to like me.

I got a date
with a soap on a rope.

Ted, Ted,
where's the corkscrew?

Come on, Sara,
strip and dip?

Bad news crews.

It's okay, guys.
He just wants his machete back.

Axel, you are the Super Bowl
of self-abuse.

This feels good!

Nobody's gonna touch that
fucking ray of sunshine.

I have seen enough
horror movies to know

any weirdo wearing a mask
is never friendly.

That's what's known
as screwing the pooch.

Ben, are you coming back or not?
And then...

You didn't get me in the lake, Jason,
and you're not gonna get me now.

My earring.

You could use a little
touch-up work first.

Man: And cut.

Melissa's a bitch.
I know... (laughing)

I can't even do it.

It's a real pain in the ass.

And you're gonna use that
for sure, I know.

I said, "It's a real pain in the ass."
You are gonna use that. I know that.

Finally he gets hacked to death
by Corey fucking Feldman?

Yo, Feld-dawg,
what the fuck?


I'm getting Haim
on your ass. Sorry.

(growls)
(screams)

I found it.

I didn't have a clue
as to what the plot was

in "Jason Goes to Hell."

A lot of shaving.

It's creepy.
It's so creepy.

Homoerotic... shaven.

(speaks gibberish)

Never show your breasts...

Here comes first Jason!

We're gonna go up to Crystal Lake
even though we've heard

that there's horrible things...
oh my God!

There's bananas everywhere.

It is a lot easier
to go watch Jason

than it is to watch Dick Cheney.

You give up?

Man: Never!

I don't know
what my lines are.

There's only one thing

that Jason knows,
and he knows it well.

(man softly)
Kill!
