Ernie?

-Glenda.

Samantha?

Yeah.

I'm Michael.

They sent me to come get you.

Great.

The boat's over here.

Okay.

I'll do this all by myself. That's okay.

That's fine.

I'm gonna go open the house.

Okay.

I wasn't expecting it to be furnished.

Well, they did die in here.

Water's good, electric is good.

You should be good to go.

How about wifi?

You gotta call it for the internet.

Takes about three weeks

Three weeks?

It's an island.

You ever drive a boat?

I filled it up yesterday.

Try to keep the gas half full.

You don't wanna get stranded out here,

especially with the storms we get.

And there's an oar here just in case.

As far as getting this thing going,

you wanna make sure it's in run.

This is run up here.

That's off.

Up is run.

Away from you is forward,

towards you, reverse.

And then when you wanna turn it off,

red button over here.

Anything else?

Best place to buy some
fresh fruits and vegetables?

Couldn't tell ya.

Anything else?

Not that I can think of right now.

All right. And be careful out there.

Especially late at night.

We don't need any more missing tourists.

I'm not a tourist.

Right.

Shut up and fish.

â™ª You're all alone â™ª

â™ª You're all alone â™ª

â™ª Oh, oh, oh â™ª

â™ª I don't give a crap â™ª

â™ª I'm taking it with me â™ª

â™ª I don't give a crap â™ª

â™ª I'm taking it with me â™ª

â™ª I don't give a crap â™ª

â™ª I'm taking it with me â™ª

â™ª I don't give a crap, crap â™ª

Yes! Yes!

Hi, it's Carl.

Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

Hi Dad.

I'm here and it's just like I remembered.

I wish you would come.

Think about it. Love you.

So I woke up
in the middle of the night

because I was stressed,

so I was walking from
my bedroom to my kitchen

to grab a glass of water,

and I just really looked and realized

that it was pitch black in my apartment.

I couldn't see anything, I
was trying to feel around.

And I went to turn the lights
on and wake up even more.

And then I was like, I
don't know, halfway there,

I accidentally kicked
something from the hall.

Like accidentally.

I'd really like to emphasize accidental.

And so I felt so bad.

Because, yeah, I couldn't see,

where I was, I was walking and...

Are you the girl on Elm Tree Island?

I am. How do you know?

No secrets around here.

Anyway, hey, I'm Mort.

I do boat repairs

so if you have any boat problems,

let me know.

It says Cliff.

Oh, I wrote it on the other side

That you did.

Thanks.

My pleasure.

I'd be careful out there.

I will. Thanks.

You must be Samantha.

I heard you were coming.

Yes, sir.

You officer Thompson?

That's Sheriff
Thompson, but call me Sam.

We keep it simple around here.

Were you the one who
found my grandparents?

Awful night. Just awful.

I'm sorry for your loss.

Thank you.

Your grandparents were a fixture

in these islands for 65 years.

This is only my second time out here.

First came when I was nine

and then my dad had a
falling out with them

and we moved out west.

Oh, I remember. Where's back west?

Vegas.

Oh, is it nice there?

It's hot.

Last night I came out and there was a boat

about a hundred feet out there

and I shot my flashlight at him,

he turned off his lantern and drove away.

Was it a male?

I couldn't tell.

Probably night fishing.
Did you call out?

No.

We deal with a few
drunk boaters around here

and an occasional fight at the bingo game,

but not much else.

Dispatcher on Radio]
Sheriff, got a call about

some teenagers in the cove.

Lacey kids again?

I think so.

All right. I'll head over.

And teenagers.

Nice meeting you.

I just stopped by to say hi.

You scared me.

I knocked.

I was in the shower.

Okay. Checking on you.

Feeling good?
I'm good.

Okay, good.

You were right about the internet.

Three weeks.

Sounds about right.

Okay, well, if I do need anything,

what's the best way to get ahold of you?

You'll see me. I'll be around.

Okay. I'll see you around then.

Okay.

Okay.

Hi, it's Carl.

Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

Can I help you?

Micheal?

911. What's your emergency.

That's an interesting story.

So you don't believe me?

What happened to the box?

I don't know.

It was gone after I called you.

Last night, someone was in my house.

You saw someone?

I saw a shadow,

and then I saw a boat
on the backside leaving.

Was anything stolen?

I don't think so.

Probably some kids playing a prank.

But Michael's boat?

My guess is he went diving

and the boat broke free from the anchor.

Yeah. Okay.

Let me be honest with you.

I don't know much about
what happens in Vegas

but some people around
here don't like change.

Maybe you rubbed somebody the wrong way.

So this is my fault?

I'm just saying it might
take some time to fit in.

Carol.

Yeah Sam?

Keep an eye out from Michael McKenzie.

Let him know we have his boat.

Will do, Sheriff.

Got a call out at the bingo hall.

Duty calls.

I'll send somebody out here
to collect Michael's boat.

You might wanna lay low for a few weeks

and don't upset any of the locals.

I'm on a way.

Are you gonna take a report?

I'll take some notes when I get back.

Have a nice evening.

Great.

Hi.

Can you help me?

Hello?

Hello?

Can you please help me?

Hello?

Huh!
Jesus Christ, girl!

Mort. I'm sorry.

What the hell are you doing out here?

I was looking for help

and there was this woman and I...

Mrs. Hunter. Forget it.

Just be wasting your time.

Why is that?

'Cause she's a mute.

And she don't like company either.

How'd you know I was here?

Saw you walking into the
woods as I was passing by.

Figure you might be in trouble is all.

I'm out of gas.
Huh.

Dangerous place to be running out of gas.

I can handle myself.

Yeah. Seems like it.

When was the last time
you filled this thing?

Two hours ago.

You can't burn a full tank that fast.

I know.

I think someone siphoned it
while I was getting food.

Best be going.

Meat don't last long in the sun, you know.

I'm vegetarian.

What now?

I only eat vegetables, fruits, nuts.

Some dairy.

Really? Like what?

A rabbit?

I guess so.

You still got my card?

Yeah.
Good.

You have any more of these
mysterious boat troubles,

you give me a call, okay?

I will. Thanks.

It's probably just a local teen

trying to get your attention.

With a dead rabbit?

I'll take it back,

dust it for prints.

This is funny to you?

I'm sorry. Bad joke.

I'll go around to the other islands

and see if anybody else
is getting these boxes.

Okay?

What about Michael?

Michael?

Did you find him?

Oh, Michael was never missing.

He didn't even know his boat
drifted away from his dock.

Okay. Thank you.

You have plenty of gas.

The sheriff came out here this morning.

Really?

You don't have a gas leak.

Someone left a box with
a bloody dead rabbit in it.

Now why the hell would
someone do something like that?

I thought you might be able to tell me.

Really? Why?

Yesterday you said I eat like a rabbit.

I say a lot of shit.

Just making conversation is all.

I don't care what you eat

Then tell me what's going on.

Why does everyone want me to leave?

Couldn't tell ya.

I like having you here.

What's the wolf all about?

Engine's fine.

Can't find anything wrong.

I can't talk to you about
this out in the open.

If you wanna know the truth,

meet me tomorrow, Crooked Creek, 2:00 PM.

That's all right. You can pay me tomorrow.

Might wanna buy an extra gas can though.

What do you want?

Mrs. Hunter?

I am so sorry.

I can't tell you how
bad I feel for almost...

Would you like some coffee?

Tea.

Danger.

What kind of danger?

This island is mine.

My grandparents left it to me.

Wolves.

I keep seeing that, what does that mean?

What is going on?

I'm not going to leave
because they don't like me

or I don't fit in.

This is my house.

I don't mean to be rude Mrs. Hunter,

but where I come from,

if you didn't stand your
ground, you became a target.

Mrs. Hunter?

It's Mort!

I just need to talk to you.

Help!

Don't move.

Turn around.

Now put the hammer down
and slide it to me.

Slide it to me, Michael.

Lay down on your stomach

and put your hands on your head.

Do it.

Why did you come here, Michael?

Why are you trying to hurt me?

Sheriff is on his way. Just
tell me why you're doing this.

Sheriff's not coming.

Michael.

It doesn't it have to
end this way, Michael.

Just tell me why.

Michael!

We found what seemed to be some sort

of shrine Michael made in
the attic of his house.

A shrine?

He had dozens of photos of you, candles,

a couple of pieces of your clothing.

I'm sorry, this might
be a bit much for you

to hear right now.

I can't imagine how shaken up you must be.

Probably be heading back to
Vegas after this ordeal, huh?

You ever been to Vegas, Sheriff?

No, ma'am. I like it right here.

So do I.

â™ª Time back when she wanted to say â™ª

â™ª You know it wouldn't matter anyway â™ª

â™ª Oh no â™ª

â™ª And you â™ª

â™ª You try â™ª

â™ª To work your way back
in to see my life â™ª

Hi.

â™ª Mama said what you wanna
be when you grow up â™ª

â™ª Doesn't matter that much
as long as your tough â™ª

â™ª Mama said what you wanna
