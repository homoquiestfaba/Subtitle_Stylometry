Forthose ofyou
who thinkyoucamehere today...

to hear us tell you
like these Negro leaders do...

thatyour times
will just get better...

that weshall
overcomesomeday...

I say toyou,
you came to the wrong place.

Becauseyour times will never
get better unless you make them better.

Those ofyou who thinkyou came here
to hear us tell you...

to turn the other cheek
to the brutality ofthe white man...

and this system ofinjustice
that's in place right here in America...

you thinkyou're gonna come here
and hear us tell you...

to go out there and beg
for a place at their lunch counter...

again, I sayyou came
to the wrong place.

We don't teach you
to turn the other cheek in the South.

And we don't teach you
to turn the other cheek in the North.

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches you to obey the law...

to carryyourselves
in a respectable way...

in a proud
Afro-American way.

But at the same time,
we teach you...

that anyone puts
their hand on you...

brother, you doyour best to see they
don't put their hand on anybody else...

again.

Time.

Just like that, Daddy.

Neverjump in one place.
Bad for the heart.

Forwards, backwards, sideways.

That's the most important thing.

I'm called Bundini.

Rhymes with Houdini.
He was aJew too.

Some people call me Fast Black.
Some call me Daddy Mac.

Gave Sugar Ray Robinson
my power for seven years.

Myvoodoo. My magic.

Now Shorty done sent me here
to work foryou.

Who's Shorty?
I call him Shorty.

Call him Shorty
'cause he like 'em circumcised.

Original people. Like Moses.
And I was a babe in a basket too.

Sonny Liston,
you ain't no champ! You a chump!

Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

Oh!
Rumble, young man, rumble.

Y'all wanna losey'all money?
Then you bet it on Sonny.

He know I'm great.
He will fall in eight.

Come on, you big, ugly bear.
I'll whupyou right now.

Two-ten and a half.
Two-ten and a half!.

The challenger, Cassius Clay,
two hundred and ten and a halfpounds.

Man, you sure that's right?
That's what the weight is.

Old, ugly bear, come on.
Let's go.

You got these folks fooled. I ain't
scared ofya! I ain't scared ofya!

Two hundred and eighteen.
Two hundred and eighteen.

Sonny Liston,
the champion ofthe world.

Two hundred and eighteen pounds.

Pounds ofwhat?
Pounds ofugly.

That man's so ugly,
when he sweat...

the sweat run backwards offhis forehand
just to stay away from his face.

Come on, you big, ugly bear!
I'll turn you into a rug!

Keep talkin'.
I'm gonna fuckyou up.

Ifyou whup me...

I'll crawl out ofthe ring and take
the firstjet airplane out the country.

Is that a promise, Mr. Clay?
You'll eat his words first.

Cassius, you're a 7-1 underdog.
Liston says he talks with his fists.

What doyou say?
You scared ofhim?

I'm gonna give Sonny Liston
talkin' lessons...

boxin' lessons
and fallin' down lessons.

Cassius, areyou a black Muslim?
Pat Putnam says in the MiamiHerald--

A man's religion is his own business.
What kind ofquestion is that?

Angelo, tell me--
Malcolm Xwas in town, then he left.

Was that so
he wouldn't embarrass you?

Yeah, Howard?
Liston doesn't likeyou.

Really can't stand you.
Says he wants to kill you.

Howard Cosell, you ain't
nothin' but an instigator.

Man, howyou get that way?
Cassius, nowyou're being truculent.

Ifit's good, I'm that.

You next. Soon as I'm done with Sonny
Liston, I'm fightin' Howard Cosell.

Y'all write that down right now.

That's good?

Wanna check that out?

Hey, man, when you get back?

I just got here.
I'm front row, seat seven.

I'll be sittin'
with Mom and Dad.

You should've stayed in the first place.
Nobody gotta hide when they're with me.

There's nothing wrong
with being cool, my brother.

He's right.

...and challenger, Cassius Clay.
Goodevening, ladiesandgentlemen.

Brought toyou
by the City Service Oil Company...

and its dealers
in 37 states and Canada...

known to millions ofmotorists
for Big Gallon gasoline...

and by new Wildroot,
totally new Wildroot in a new tube...

with a great formula that grooms hair
to look neat and natural, never greasy.

Another boxing milestone
is at hand.

Injust a few minutes,
Louisville's Cassius Marcellus Clay...

will be facing
the devastating punching power...

ofthe heavyweight champion,
Charles "Sonny" Liston.

...for the heavyweight championship
ofthe world.

Introducing, on my right--

And now the time has come.

Both challenger and champion
are in the ring.

The heavyweight championship
ofthe world is on the line.

Ifit goes past the first round,
there will be surprises already.

Sonny Liston wrapped in that
terry cloth towel ofhis...

wrapped around his head
swami fashion...

Iooking as malevolent
and baleful as ever.

But this man
is a professional prizefighter.

Make no mistake about it.

I want a clean fight.

When I say break,
stop punching and step back.

Doyou have
any questions, champ?

Any questions, challenger?

We're fine.
Touch gloves, gentlemen. Good luck.

Good evening,
sports fans across the nation.

Liston in the white trunks
with the black stripes.

Clay, an inch and a halftaller, in
the white trunks with the red stripes--

And Cassius Clay
is sidestepping.

There it is, champ.
Stay on your toes now.

And we can see that the champion
is the aggressor.

There's a shot under the heart.

Cassius Clay slips away.
And now Clay pounds a left.

Another left. A straightjab.

It seems to have stunned him.
And that's the bell.

And they're fighting after the bell.
And they're still fighting.

This round is over.

Break it up, ref.

There is no love lost between
the two contenders at this time.

Cassius goes back to his corner.
It's been an amazing round.

You can beat this guy.

I'm still here.

And Sonny Liston
is not taking the stool.

He's anxious to get back
into the challenger's face.

Take it to the body.
Kill the body, the head will follow.

This is a totally different fight
than Liston expected...

and anyone in this arena
will tell you.

There's a long, looping left hand.
Clay's eyes are wide open now.

Come on, Cass! Move!
Step back.

Come on, Cassius!
Come on, Chi-Chi!

I'm not prognosticating
anything...

but merely his survival
to thisjuncture--

Cass, hit him!

Break.

Let him go.

Sonny Liston is hurt.
He's bleeding from his eye.

He's defying the experts early.

We have to take a look at this man and
say he is not in awe ofthe champion.

He ain't nothin' to me.
And he know it.

This is it now.

Let me have that,John.

And now they're ready.

You gonna knock
the ugly offofhim.

That's gonna take a long time,
butyou can do it.

There he is. Get him off.
Doyourjob, ref.

Shake him.
Doyourjob, ref.

There it is.

Come on, ref.

Break.

There he is.
Clay slips around and out.

Up against the ropes.
Right above me now.

Too tight. Get in there.

My eyes. There's something in my eyes.
I can't see nothin'.

Come on.

What's going on?
Nothin'.

The guy's punchin' on the breaks.
Just take care ofit. We're fine.

I can't see nothin', man.
Just go and cut 'em off, Angie.

No, no. You can't fight
with no gloves on.

Just get up. Get up.
Try and do it. Come on.

I can't see, man.

Come on, Cass!
Dance!

Liston crouching,
hitting to the body.

It's like he's blinking,
like he doesn't see Liston.

Ref, you gotta doyourjob.

Hold it.

Stay away from him, Clay.
Stay away from him.

The champion, you can see,
is the aggressor.

Get him, Cass!
Come on, Cass!

Knock him up!
Clay looks all done.

Hold on to him!

Stop it. Stop. Break.
Knock him up.

Get on him.
Get on him, man.

You can see him now.
You go get him, man.

Clay lands a left,
but Liston ducked under it...

and took it high
on the forehead.

It's Clay coming on.

And Liston backs away.

And all the predictions
are going down the drain...

as Liston is listless.

And there's the bell.

We're coming up
to round seven.

Wait a minute!

Liston's not coming out.

The winner and new heavyweight
champion ofthe world is Cassius Clay.

Eatyourwords!
Eatyourwords!

Les, I'm going up into the ring.
Get back.

I'm the greatest thing
ever happened to boxing.

Cassius. Cassius.

I shook up the world!

It's a scene of
absolute bedlam in the ring!

I am the greatest.
I'm a bad man. I shook up the world!

Did he ever hurtyou?

I'm only 22 years old.
I ain't got a mark on my face.

I must be the greatest.
And you're pretty.

I must be the greatest.

Wait. Hold on. Hold on one second.
That's Sam Cooke back there.

Come on, Sam Cooke.
Let Sam Cooke in here.

The greatest rock-and-roll singer,
and I'm the world's greatest boxer.

Hello, Sam.

That mummy's
gonna get him, baby.

That mummy ain't gonna get him.
Yeah, he is.

He ain't scared ofthat mummy.
That mummy too slow to catch anybody.

What's going on, Sam?
Howyou doing, Cassius?

Don't believe that stuffon TV.
Don't listen to him.

Hey, congratulations, Clay.
Hey, thankyou,Jim.

Hell ofa fight.
You next, man. You next.

Go ahead and get some food, brother.
Cassius ClayversusJim Brown.

Biggest fight in history.

The mummy only has one eye.
One eye and a limp.

That mummy's 643 years old.

He can't catch nobody.
Look at him.

You gotta fall down 'cause that's
the onlyway the mummy could catch you.

Way to go, champ!

Yeah, you the greatest.
Thankyou, brother. Thankyou.

I'll seeyour next fight.
You'll see the next one?

Oh, yeah.
Well, you better get there very early.

You better get there very early
'cause that man's going down.

Ifhe talk a littlejive,
he's going down in five.

He talk a little more,
I might drop him in four.

Ifyou wanna have more fun,
do it in round one.

Oh, yeah. Hold on.
I'm doing the rhymin'.

The people really look up toyou. You
plan on being a champ likeJoe Louis?

Well, yeah, I'm gonna be
the people's champ.

Not likeJoe Louis.
Well, you know, not exactly.

My name is not Clay.

Clay is the name ofthe people
that owned my ancestors...

and I no longerwanna be called
by that slave name.

I am Cassius X.
Minister Malcolm.

What about the divisions
in the Nation oflslam?

This is the champ's time. I'm here
as a friend to support his victory...

so I have nothing you want.

I'm definitely gonna be
the people's champion...

but I just ain't gonna be the champ
the wayyou want me to be the champ.

I'm gonna be the champ
the way I wanna be.

...fornohomeis immune
to termites...

nomatterhow well
itisbuiltormaintained.

Hey, brother.
I was leaving.

I sawyour light on.
Whatyou doing up at this hour, champ?

Oh, man, I'm watching this program
on termites.

And them little itsy-bitsy things is
eatin' these people's whole house down.

Oh, man, look.

I've been invited to speak
at lbadan University in Nigeria.

You wanna go with me?
Hey, look, man.

You can have six million termites
in your house and don't even know it...

till you going to get something to eat
and you bust through the floor.

What'd you say? Where?
Africa. You been?

Africa.

All right, come on.
Let's go.

What is it?

You ever thought
you'd lose it?

I mean, really lose it?

When I was little, I tore out
this picture of Emmett Till.

They put the barbed wire
around his neck...

and strapped him
to that 75-pound cotton gin fan.

And they cut out one ofhis eyes
'cause he looked at some white lady.

Man.

I couldn't take my eyes to it,
couldn't throw it away.

When I heard about those...

four little girls who got bombed
in that Birmingham church...

the prohibitions ofthe Honorable
Elijah Muhammad prevented me...

from speaking
my thoughts in action.

Because Birmingham was part
ofthe civil rights struggle.

You know, begging for our place
at the white man's table.

But dead children
are dead children.

So the anger I felt
I had to contain.

I locked it up so tight...

my muscles seized.

I lost control
over the right side ofmy body.

My leg gave out.

Right arm gave out.
"I'm having a stroke," I thought.

But I had to hold it in
'cause all I wanted--

Brother, all I wanted to do
was find something and break it.

Break a part--
Break any part ofthis system...

becauseyou are so provoked
in your heart...

and your spirit
as a human being...

at dead children.

And I could do...

nothing.

Everyone knows
I can't do nothing...

anymore.

So Elijah Muhammad has suspended me
as a minister in the Nation oflslam.

Man...

you can fix that.

I don't know.

I'll trywhen we get back.

You get some rest, champ.

All right, brother.

Sit.

You know, only after
long service and high merit...

in the spiritual and physical rebirth
ofAfro-American people...

is one granted an original name.

Butyou are special.

A world champion.

So there is a gift
I wish to giveyou.

From this day forward...

you will be known
as Muhammad Ali.

What?
That's right.

You what?

Well, what's wrong with our name?
My name?

We-- We madeyou.

Ain't nobody made me.

No bow tie-wearin',
Arab-talkin' nigger gonna change that.

Ain't nobody in that ring but me.
I made me.

You don't know whoyou are.

I know who I ain't.
I ain't drinkin'.

I ain't going back on mywife
and for sure I ain't prayin'...

to no blond-haired,
blue-eyedJesus.

Paintin' those blue-eyed, blond-haired
Jesuses is what put food in you.

Steak and vegetables on the table.
It's dinner!

Go ahead.

Go ahead.

Hello?

Hereyou go, Daddy.

Thankyou, baby.

Yeah?
BrotherMalcolm.

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has given
the Muslim name of Muhammad Ali...

to Cassius X.

HerbertMuhammadhasbeenput

He will not be traveling
with you to Africa.

Healsoaskedme

Whaty'all done did

I am the pilot.
He's the copilot.

Here. Sit down, Mr. Clay.

Oh, man.

In Louisville, where I growed up,
they barely let black folks drive buses.

Muhammad!

Hey, brother.
What's going on, man?

Whatyou doing here?
I wasjust going to the airport.

Wejust got here now.
So whereyou going?

Liberia.

Say hello to Maya Angelou right here
and Ambassador Huang Hua.

And that is Taher Kaid.
He's the ambassador from Algeria.

Oh, man. Where should I go?
I wanna go all over this place.

Go to Algeria.
See Ben Bella.

Then go to see Mecca and Medina.
I just came from there.

Made my seven circuits
around the Kaaba.

I prayed at sunrise. Two million people.
Pilgrims from all over, man.

Dressed the same.
High and low, the same.

Blond-haired, blue-eyed Muslims,
Arabs, Africans, lndonesians.

Seeing brothersjust like us,
praying together, it was beautiful.

I drankwater
from the well ofZem Zem.

I prayed in the ancient city of Mena.
I prayed on Mount Arafat.

Youshouldn'thave quarreled
with Eliijah Muhammad.

Walking in their footsteps.

All ofus together.

You shouldn't have quarreled
with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

What?

You shouldn't have quarreled
with Elijah Muhammad.

Hey, Brother Muhammad,
look here.

Brother Muhammad!

Listen, I'm sorry
to keepyou waiting.

Into each life...

a little rain must fall.

And, you know,
every day cannot be sunny.

Every smile is not
a smile ofhappiness.

And every tear that is shed--

Sonji, Sonji, Sonji.

Whatyou keep saying my name for?
'Cause I love it, girl.

-How long you been working with Herbert?
-About a year.

I sell MuhammadSpeaks
over the phone.

What kind ofname is that?
My father named me after Sonja Henie.

What's your father do?

He was shot in a poker game
when I was two, so he don't do nothing.

And my mother died
when I was eleven.

Who raised you?
My godparents.

But I been offon my own
for a long time.

Whatyou doing tomorrow?
Go for a ride with me.

Oh, no, no. I gotta work.
I'm gonna square it with Herbert.

Herbert said you met the Beatles.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

Only one of'em is smart, though.
The fella with the glasses.

Oh, he is my favorite.

Yeah, folks was screaming
and fainting.

I said, "Man, is this how they act
when you get big?"

What did he say?
He said, "Champ...

And you know I got a man somewhere
out there that I don't mind crawling to.

Sometimes I wake up in the midnight
hour, tears rolling down my face.

And ifl look around for my man
and I can't find him...

I follow the Lord,
look a little higher.

Kind ofpray to the Lord.

Because I always believed that the Lord
could help me ifnobody else could.

But sometime
I think he don't even hear me.

So I have to fall a little lower
on my knees, look a little higher.

Kind ofraise myvoice
a little higher.

And this is what I say
when I call on my man.

I especiallywantyou ladies to listen
to me 'cause maybeyou can try this.

It might helpyou
every once in a while.

This is whatyou say

Honey, please.

Well, no,

But I may as well be.

I ain'tjoking.

I always know when I know.

You see this face?

You got a pretty face
for a lady's face...

butyou ever seen anything

Who wouldn't want

What, you five foot three
or something like that?

That's too small for me,
but I'm gonna make an exception.

Oh, well, thankyou.
Because ofyour spirit.

My spirit?
Yeah, girl. You too much fun.

Butyou got to be a Muslim.
A Muslim?

And howyou do that? Youjump over
a broom and, shazam, you're a Muslim?

I ain't never been
with nobody likeyou.

And, baby...

baby, you ain't never
gonna be with any other.

What?
That's right.

I wanna marry her.

True love.

You don't marry that girl.
She was a date.

Have some fun.

She's notyourwife.
You don't marry this girl.

Here's some management papers.
I need you to sign right there.

My fatherwould kill me.

Watch whatyou're signing, Ali.

This ain't got nothing
to do with you.

Anything's to do with me I say is to do
with me, fat boy. I'm still a Christian.

And get me a kosher cook. I want
that lady over at Malcolm's temple.

Lana Shabazz.
And put my brother on payroll.

Fifty G a year
just for drivin' andjivin'.

What doyou say, Howard?
Come on full-time as my photographer?

I'm not gonna be on the payroll.
I'm freelance. Emphasis on "free."

Muhammad, she's not foryou.

When I met her,
she worked in a cocktail lounge...

with a bunny tail
on her backside.

What the hell was you doing
in a bunny tail lounge anyway, Herbert?

Sellin' MuhammadPeeks?

You been saving it up training, Ali.
Your ass.

You should spread that stuffaround
a little bit beforeyou settle down.

No, man. Marriage is
the cornerstone of Muslim life.

Yeah, well, Sonji Roi is not a Muslim.
Well, she's gonna be now.

Youjust fix it up, Herbert.

Yeah. Okay.

So, whywe meeting?

I got Malcolm shoulder to shoulder
with Martin Luther King.

And we got Malcolm traveling all over
the world, getting Ben Bella and Nasser.

We were better offbefore
with Malcolm inside the Nation.

So we've decided
we wantyou...

to get Elijah Muhammad
to take Malcolm back.

That's ajoke,Joe.

When am I being reimbursed
for my expenses?

Dry-cleaning all these suits
is not free.

We gotta talk about this guy too.

Get me receipts, I'll reimburseyou
foryour dry cleaning.

Whatyou drinking?
What I'm drinking?

Come on, champ. This is water.
You know I'm a natural man.

You know.

What's going on? We're late.
I'm changing my damn clothes.

You gave me that look,
so I knowyou don't like what I had on.

What is this?
Whatyou wanted, isn't it?

A water glass with vodka in it.
No, that was before.

Before what, sir?
Beforeyou showed up. Get out ofhere.

I'm fine running around here
in these cute, short things foryou.

I am submissive toyou.

I ain't gonna be submissive to them
BrotherX's and Z's...

about what they think.

They ask me a bunch
ofquestions all the time anyway.

What questions?
Aboutyou and us.

And I ain't telling them shit.
You tell it like it is, sugar.

Took away my boy's name.
What they give him back?

Bad style.

I thinkyou drunk.
Daddy Clay, you're something else.

Now, that's a firecracker right there.
We're gonna have to workwith that.

A scale ofone to ten.
That's right.

I have one-- I had a ten--
Well, I didn't have a ten.

I had a five--
five good twos.

I don't drink. I don't smoke.
I converted to lslam foryou.

Okay? l--
All except the dress.

Whatyou doing in my pockets, man?
Getyour hand out ofmy pocket!

Hold it, my brothers.

Just be cool.

Be cool.

Brother, you crazy?

They killed Malcolm!
They shot Malcolm! They shot Malcolm!

They shot Malcolm!

Apparently, the unknownman...

walkedup

at the time
MalcolmXwas speaking...

openedfireathim
at veryshortrange.

The arena is surrounded by FBl.

The stands are only halffull.

The promoter has taken out
a million-dollar insurance policy...

due to Cassius Clay's membership in
the militant and radical black Muslims.

And, oh, by the way,
Sonny Liston is here too.

Touch gloves
and come out fighting.

Come on, son.

Come on, Chi-Chi.
Put a whupping on him now.

Ain't nothing changed.

Whup on him now.
Whup up on him.

Way to go!

There it is!
Sock it to him, baby!

Yes!

Get up!
Ain't nobody gonna believe this.

Get up!

Yes!

Confused.
We're confused.

Check his time.
Timekeeper's sounding it's over.

Check his time!

It is over!

I think the champ
was in a hurry.

Areyou okay?

What's wrong?

Whyyou all done up like that?

I'm out there dying foryou
out ofworry.

Worry?
Yes.

And all you can think about
is ifl look dull enough?

What ifl straightened my hair
and moved into some white suburb?

How I am says something.

You want me to go get her?

Not now.

Not right now, fellas.
Not now.

What I got to do?
About Sonji?

Have no contact with her
for 90 days.

Make a public statement
ofdivorce at the mosque...

and lslamic law
will be satisfied.

Satisfaction is not making it with
the woman who send you to the moon?

I'm the only normal person
left around here.

I'm a blackJew, I can't read
and I'm halfdrunk.

I need to talk toyou.

No, you can stay, Brother Herbert.
Brother? He ain'tyour brother.

Your brother's taking yourwife back
to Chicago. She's crying like a widow.

Well, I ain't dead.
Well, you may as well be.

You don't rememberyour name
orwhoyou are.

You gonna try for Germany?

You gonna try to get
stationed in Germany?

Everybody is trying to avoid Vietnam.
Whatyou talkin' about, man?

They changed your classification.
It's in the paper.

What?
Champ. Eskridge.

You're 1 A.

They tryin' to draft me in the army?
You know about this?

Okay, here we go.

All right, all right.
Hey, I got to go.

They started runnin'.

You know, so I went down there,
I did everything I was supposed to do...

You know, so I went down there,
I did everything I was supposed to do...

and I flunked
their draft board test.

Then without testing me again,
to see ifl'm anywiser orworser...

they decide
I can go in the army?

Cassius, in my opinion--
My name ain't Cassius Clay.

That is a slave name,
and I am a free man.

I am Muhammad Ali.

You know, I apologize.
I apologize toyou on the air.

Your name is Muhammad Ali.

You have a right to be called
whateveryou want.

I apologize toyou.

You sure make a lot ofmistakes
for a so-called educated man.

You reallywent to law school?
Yes, Muhammad.

And to think I gave up a lucrative
practice for the likes ofyou.

I'm the best thing
ever happened toyou, Cosell.

Without me, you'd be a tall white man
with a microphone in his mouth.

And without me,
you'd be a mouth.

We'll be right back.

You want some food for that thing?
How could you do such a thing?

'Cause it's funny.
To someoneyou revere.

That thing almost bit my finger off.
Mr. Bundini...

I'm glad you were here
to witness this-- this assault.

Have a little coffee
with your sugar.

They're coming afteryou...

because they're scared of
black militancy in the inner cities.

I ain't no H. Rap Brown.
I ain't no Stokely Carmichael.

All they are is political.

You're the heavyweight
champion ofthe world.

Here's the deal the government offered.
You do six weeks in basic.

You go to the reserves.
You don't go to Vietnam.

Now, the messengerwould not object
ifyoujoined under those terms.

I stay out ofjail and keep boxing.

Ifyou accept the induction,
life goes on.

Marvin DeckerAnderson,
US Army.

Marvin DeckerAnderson,
US Army.

Juan Raymondo Benitez,
US Army.

Pryce Marshall Benson,
US Marines.

Cassius Marcellus Clay,
US Army.

Mr. Clay,
I'm required to inform you...

that refusal to accept
a lawful induction order...

constitutes a felony...

under the Universal Military
Training and Service Act...

punishable by
fiveyears imprisonment...

and a $1 0,000 fine.

Doyou understand?

Yes, sir.

Federal Bureau oflnvestigation.

Mr. Clay, you're under arrest
for refusing induction.

Yeah.

Yeah, this is me.

No, you got to ask Chauncey Eskridge.
That's my lawyer. He's in Chicago.

No, I'm out on bail.

No, man, I ain't never
shot nothin' in my life.

No ducks, no geese,
no deer, no nothin'.

Yeah, I know where Vietnam is.
It's on TV.

Southeast Asia?
What, it's there too?

What do I think about who?

The Vietcong?

Man, I ain't got no quarrel
with them Vietcong.

Ain't no Vietcong
ever called me nigger.

Yeah, that's right.

You know whatyou're doin', Ali?

You know whatyoujust said?

Everyone, Europe to China,
every home in America...

everyone's gonna know what the
heavyweight champion ofthe world...

said about the US war.

So what? So what?
I ain't got to be...

what nobody else
want me to be...

and I ain't afraid to be
what I wanna be...

think how I wanna think.

I got almost nowhere I can
promote a fight foryou.

Plus I think they're gonna
vacateyou from the crown.

What?
Yeah, ifyou're convicted.

Oh, so they're gonna take from me
what no fighter in the world can.

And New York may revoke
your boxing license.

You sureyou wanna do this?

The next three to fouryears
are every heavyweight's prime.

There are few ofthoseyears.

What about Terrell?
We'll know about that this afternoon.

I gotta find us some venues fast.
I'll call you later.

You understand the issue is your
license to fight Terrell in Illinois?

Yes.

Then areyou prepared
to apologize...

aboutyour unpatriotic remarks
about the war?

You sayyou're the people's champion.
Yes, sir.

Doyou thinkyou're acting
like the people's champion?

Yes, sir.
I'm not gonna apologize toyou.

This is not a courtroom, and I do not
have to answeryour questions.

What about Terrell?
We'll fight in another state!

Areyou gonna dodge the draft?
I ain't draft-dodgin'...

I ain't burnin' no flag,
and I ain't runnin' to Canada.

I'm stayin' right here.
You wanna send me tojail?

Fine. You go right ahead.
I've been injail for 400 years.

I can be there
for four or five more.

But I ain't goin'
no 1 0,000 miles...

to help murder and kill
other poor people.

Ifl wanna die, I'll die right here
right now, fightin' you, ifl wanna die.

You my enemy. Not no Chinese,
no Vietcong, noJapanese.

You my opposer
when I want freedom.

You my opposerwhen I wantjustice.
You my opposerwhen I want equality.

You want me to go somewhere
and fight foryou.

You won't even stand up for me
right here in America...

for my rights
and my religious beliefs.

You won't even stand up for me
right here at home.

Which guyyou want to go first?
You, sir.

Tell Clay he gettin' on after me.
I'm the champ.

What?
I said you can get on after me.

No. What'd you call me?
I called you Clay.

You will announce it from right here,
from flat on your back.

What's my name?
What's my name?

What's my name? Say my name!
You gonna say my name!

Your mama called you Clay!
I'm gonna call you Clay!

I wantyou all to tell
all their aunts...

and all their uncles
and cousins and friends...

get toyour television set,
get toyour radio...

'cause I neverwanted
to whup a man so bad!

What's my name?
What's my name?

What's my name, motherfucker?
What's my name?

What's my name?

Thejury has found you guilty
ofrefusing induction...

into the United States
Armed Forces.

Does the defense have anything
it wants to say?

Yeah, I'd appreciate ifthe court would
just give me my sentence right now...

rather than waitin' and stallin'.

Verywell.

I sentenceyou to
the maximum sentence allowable:

fiveyears imprisonment
and a fine of$1 0,000.

Doubtless your lawyer
will lodge an appeal...

so whileyou're free on bond, I order
thatyour passport be surrendered.

I'll not haveyou benefiting yourself
by fighting abroad.

This court is adjourned.

Hold on. Watch this.
I've been working on this at home.

Hold on. Watch this.
I've been working on this at home.

Just relax.

See? 'Cause it's spooky and sometimes
people get scared and run.

Pay attention.
This is very spooky.

Go ahead.
Blow on that for me.

See, you don't need
to fight no more.

You don't remember me, doyou?

Yeah. I remember somethin'.
What's your name?

You know my name.
I knowyour name.

You came to my school
right beforeyou won the title.

I interviewed you
for my school paper.

I was eleven.

You had a long braid.

Yeah.

You called me "Little lndian Girl."
Wow.

Man, that was you.
That was me.

And I loved you then,
just like all them kids did.

I never stopped.
I still do.

Hey, did you see
that Ellis-Quarry fight?

Yeah.

We're gonna be in front of
the US Court ofAppeals next month.

We're gonna lose.

We'll appeal to the Supreme Court.
-Jimmy Ellis, the champ.

Man, I've been whupping on that boy
since I was 1 6.

All that's gonna happen,
they gonna give Ellis to Frazier...

Frazier's gonna kill him,
then what?

Where's the gate?
Then they got to let me fight.

Jimmy Ellis.
Fight that boy in a phone booth.

Fight him in the middle ofTimes Square.
You think that'd draw a crowd?

Champ, draw a crowd
or not draw a crowd...

it's not gonna make a difference
with your boxing licenses.

The ACLU's handling your case
against the New York Boxing Commission.

They've discovered that New York's
got actual ex-murderers...

and ex-rapists
currently licensed to fight.

But revokeyours?

They don't wantyou to fight.

Tijuana.
No.

State Department refuses permission
for the one-hourvisa.

No fight in Tijuana.
Look--

Can't fight here.
Can't fight outside the country.

I know people
in the restaurant business.

Theywant to start a chain.
Muhammad Ali Champ Burgers.

Muhammad Malts,
Fistful of Fries.

All ofthat.

Why do I wanna be
in the restaurant business?

'Causeyou need the money.

How much all this gonna cost?
Too much.

They do that toyou too, you know.

They bustyou out.

All right.

Go get me some
Champ Burgers.

Did y'all see that?
That manjust hit me.

Oh, you done messed up now, sucka.
You done messed up--

I don't wanna do nothin'
in front ofyour daughters, though.

I can't beatyou up
in front ofyour daughters.

Hey, champ, good to seeyou.
All right, ladies. Take care now.

All right now.
All right now.

You called me "Little lndian Girl"
'cause I wore my hair in a braid.

And then I said,
"Man, you scribble.

You can't even write.

Need to go back to school
till you learn how to do it better."

Now, whyyoujust havin'
a fresh mouth talkin' to me.

Soyou think that's funny, huh?

Telling me I can't write,
that I scribble.

Nowyou wanna try
to make up with me.

This will make everything better.
Shut up.

Mommy and Daddy

Whois theheavyweightchampion
ofthe world?

What's happenin'?

Hey, man.
We lost on the appellate level...

We'reheading to theSupreme Court.
We already got turned down there.

I'm petitioning on a conscientious
objection basis. Religious belief.

Ibelieve that they'llhearthat.

Where themoney

Herbertsayl'm runnin'on empty.
Now,justputaside...

"How did that happen?"

Then you go tojail for fiveyears.

Oh, I saw Bundini
when I was in Europe.

Yeah? How is he?
He's bad. He's in bad shape, man.

You better getyour belt back

Look at this.

Joe Frazier.
He can't up no gate.

Can't fill no arena.
They got to let me fight.

Fight.

Ifthat happens, promise meyou'll
put some new people around you.

Whatyou talkin' about?

Where Herbert and them
when we need 'em?

Gene Kilroy's dropping offgroceries
like charity.

We borrow money from my folks.

They're all overyou when you got it,
and then theyjust drop offyou...

when you don't.

Norton, he's big and strong,
but he ain't nothin'.

Hold on a second,Joe.
They're telling me we have a caller.

Go ahead, please.
Cosell, this is MuhammadAli.

It's Muhammad Ali.

Everybody knows
that I am the champ.

The crown is a lie. I know it's a lie.
Joe Frazier knows it's a lie.

And it's time for everybody
to stop lying and tell the truth.

Let's tellitlikeitis.
Withyourcourtandboxingproblems...

I would fightJoe Frazier for free
in a phone booth...

in the middle ofTimes Square
ifl wasn't broke.

Didyousayyou werebroke?
Howcanyoubebroke?

Youmademoremoney thanallprevious
heavyweights champions combined.

Whataboutyourmanagement?
Surely theyhaveprovidedforyou.

AIll'm trying tosayisit's time
foreverybodytostop lyin'.

MuhammadAliis the champ.

Get my son Herbert
on the telephone.

Muhammad, thankyou for calling in.
I'll relay that toJoe.

And telIJoe I said
he is very ugly.

Muhammadsays thathe will
fightyouanywhere, anytime...

andthat the championship reallyishis
until thatbattle ensues.

Mr. Ali has sporting blood.

Mr. Ali wants a place
in this sports world.

He loves it too much.

I am therefore suspending Mr. Ali
from the practice oflslam.

He may no longer appear in temple,
pray or teach...

or have any conversation
with any Muslim whatsoever.

Why didn'tyou call
an ambulance or a doctor?

Because he gave meyour number
when he checked in.

Normally, he's up there
making a lot ofnoise.

But now he hasn't answered the door
in three days.

What's that?
It's daylight.

Get me that short dog.

Give it to me.

What's wrong with you?

Ain't nothin' wrong with me.
My head ain't bad.

Leave me alone.
Leaveyou alone. You called me!

Yes, but that was a week ago.

Why areyou shamin' yourself?
Let me go, man.

Whyyou doin' that
toyourself?

Whyyou shamin' yourself?
Ain't nobody shamed.

Ain't nothin' wrong with me.

I'm flyin'.

The Sky Chieftalk through me.
I know the word.

You know low.
Yeah?

I know low where the king
is goin' back to his throne!

From the root to the fruit!
Them rhymes is old, Bundini.

You need to get some new ones.

God don't care aboutyou.
Don't care about me.

In all ofeverything, we don't mean
nothin'. He don't owe us.

We be.

And that's the onliest thing He did.

But that's good.
That's whywe free.

But free ain't easy. Free is real
and real is a motherfucker.

It eats raw meat.

It walk in its own shoes.

It don't everwaiver.

Yeah.

I-- I sold your belt.

I sold your belt to a barber
for $500 on Lenox Avenue.

That's how low I did you.
I couldn't help it. I got a crazy mind.

That belt sayyou the heavyweight
boxing champion ofthe world...

and I took that $500...

and I put it in my arm.

That's what I called to tell you.

I heard about the Nation stuff,
the courtroom.

Whatyou gonna do?

Take me back.

I could go down there and get the belt.
I can go get the belt.

Hey, champ.

$1 ,000 to the man that bring me
Howard Cosell's toupee dead or alive!

Don't bother me.
I'm a world-famous sportscaster...

and you're an ex-champion
with diminished skills.

I can't be seen with you.

How's it goin', champ?
Pretty good, man.

Muhammad, I'd do anything foryou.
You know that.

But I've got bosses who only
give a damn about Nielsen ratings.

I guarantee...

it will be a historical
and a momentous night.

Ifthey came to me tomorrow and say,
"We wantyou to fightJoe Frazier.

Madison Square Garden.
Millions and millions ofdollars.

Here's your license back."
I will tell them...

"I will never fight again."

Frankly, Muhammad, I'm surprised,
because unless you--

or until you fight Frazier--

Cosell, areyou losin' your hearing
along with your hair?

Don't put no question to it, man.
I done told you, I'm through fightin'.

I got a much bigger contender,
a much heavier opponent.

I'm fightin'
the entire US government.

Doyou think
you're going tojail?

I don't know. I don't know.

Joe Frazier told me on this show
that he could knockyou out.

See, thereyou go agitatin'.

You should've asked Smokin'Joe
what have he been smokin'?

That boy even dream he whupped me,
he betterwake up and apologize.

Ifl was togetin thering withJoe...

here's whatyoumightsee.

Ali comes out to meet Frazier,
but Frazier starts to retreat.

IfJoe goes back an inch farther,
he'll wind up in a ringside seat.

Ali swings with his left,
Ali swings with his right.

Just look at the kid
carry the fight.

Frazier keeps backin',
but there's not enough room.

It's only a matter oftime
before Ali lowers the boom.

Aliswings withhis right.
Whatabeautifulswing.

But thepunch lifts Frazier
clean outofthering.

Frazier's still risin',
and the referee wears a frown...

'cause he can't start countin'
till Frazier comes down.

Frazier's disappeared from view.
The crowd is getting frantic.

But our radar stations picked him up.
He's somewheres over the Atlantic.

Now, who would've thought
when they came to the fight...

theywas gonna witness the launchin'
ofa black satellite.

But don't wait for that fight.

It ain't never gonna happen.

Onliest thingyoucoulddo...

is wonderandimagine.

This has been another
sports exclusive from ABC.

Two. Go two.
OvertoJim McKay...

in Bern, Switzerland.

Howyou gonna go from me toJim McKay?
Listen, uh--

Did yourwife leaveyou yet?
No, she hasn't left meyet.

She's going to, 'cause I
told yourwife when I seen her...

I said, "Listen, whyyou
doin' this toyourself?"

Oh, man,Joe.
Who dresses you?

You look like the heavyweight
champion ofpimps.

Hey, shut up and get in.

Thatjacket's a mess, man.

Whatyou in Philly for?
Philly's my town.

Well, I just wanted to get
a little closer toyou, honey.

Man, fuckyou.

There'll be two undefeated heavyweight
champions, and they ain't fightin'.

What aboutyour license?
I can fight in Atlanta.

There ain't no state boxing commission
in Georgia.

It's all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta
againstJerry Quarry...

but we got to get this
steamroller movin' right now.

So what do I have to do?

All you got to do is announce
that after I whupJerry Quarry...

you gonna give me a title shot.

Come on, man.
Say it! Say it!

What I got and all I got,
I got with these right here.

Hell, man, I already got the title.

So I ain't got nothin' to win,
but I got everythin' to lose.

Yeah, butyou know
you ain't the real champyet.

You beat Quarry...

I'm gonna getyou in the ring.
I'm gonna kickyour ass.

By the way...

you need any money
or anything to tideyou by?

No, I'm fine.

Time!

Whatyou want?

Take me back, boss.

I'm clean.

This is a resurrection.
This is God's act.

And the prophet is goin' home.

Take me with you, boss.

I'll do anything.

Your hands can't hit
whatyour eyes can't see.

Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

Rumble, young man, rumble.

God ain't watchin'!
Ain't nobody but us!

God ain't watchin'!
Ain't nobody but us!

There it is!
Stay in his face!

Go, Muhammad!

There it is!

Now for the right. Boom!

Prophet is goin' home
to the throne.

That's howyou do it, Ali.

That's howyou do it.

You okay?
You're a goddamn Superman.

Ain't no kryptonite
in this ring tonight.

We wantJoe Frazier!
We want him!

We wantJoe Frazier!
And you deserve it. You deserve it.

This prophet is comin' home,
goin' from the darkness to the light.

Soak it in this
for about 20 minutes.

We don't need their management.

Hey, Herbert, we did good.
Doin' good tonight.

All praise to Allah.

The messenger has lifted
your suspension.

Congratulations.

Soyou're sayin'
I can be a Muslim again.

Yes.
I ain't never stopped.

Just like I ain't never stopped
bein' the champ.

I begged my father
to reinstateyou.

When? When you do that, Herbert?

After I promoted this Quarry fight
or after I won it?

We can get Frazier.
Man, I done already got Frazier.

We can get $5 million for Frazier.

We talkin' management,
talkin' money or talkin' religion?

When I got leery
and talked up why I'm broke...

then come the suspension.

Nowyou explain that one to me,
my brother.

That was my father.

Your father.

I loveyour father, Herbert.
I swear, man. I love the Nation.

But it don't own me.

You go on out there
and you make that Frazier deal.

My brother.
Yeah, your brother Herbert.

Go on somewhere,
make that deal.

And he accepts me.
I'mJewish, butyet he's Muslim...

and we still get along.

He understands me. He understands me
and he still allows me to hang with him.

He knows I like pork and white women,
but still allows me to be here with him.

Now, I can give up pork...

but them white women,
goddamn it!

Howyou deal with it, boy?

Hello?
Muhammad, it's foryou.

Thankyou, Lana.

Yeah?
Muhammad? Howard Cosell.

You TKO'd them.
Hey, whatyou talkin' about, Howard?

With Quarry?
No.

The Supreme Court ruled today...

vs. Cassius Clay...

aka MuhammadAli.

You won an eight-to-zero
unanimous decision.

You're free.

Congratulations.

I'm free.

The Supreme Court

What areyou talkin' about?

Eight-to-oh, unanimous decision.

The Supreme Court

AndFrazieris down again!

Hemaybe--
No, he's rising.

It's over!ltis over!

It'd be easy to get a fight
with Frazier now.

Only thing he's champion of
is gettin' knocked down.

George Foremanis
theheavyweightchampion ofthe world.

The Rumble in theJungle.
That is the name that I've given it.

Muhammad Ali and George Foreman
in Kinshasa, Zaire.

Don, Zaire?
Yeah, Don.

I mean, why not Antarctica,
somethin' like that?

What's wrong with New York City?

Becauseyou miss the significance.

See, I dream ofovercoming
400 years ofracial depression...

to the dawn ofa new day ofliberation,
financial and otherwise.

It will raise up the spirits
ofour inner cities.

It will rise up and fill with hope,
the souls...

the unrequited needs
ofthe black proletariat.

That is, the discouraged, dispirited,
denigrated denizens...

ofthe demimonde
that is called the ghetto.

Man, Don, you crazy.

You must've studied the whole
"D" section ofthe dictionary.

Good morning, sister.

Hi, brother.

Howyou doin', champ?

Why they saying that?
What they sayin'?

What that mean?
I don't understand.

It means--
What?

It mean, "Ali, kill him.
Ali, kill him."

The champ is here!

Ladies and gentlemen, the heavyweight
champion ofthe world has arrived!

The champ is here!

Hey, man.

He's quiteyounger than you.
Howyou feeling about that?

He's quiteyounger than me?
Well, we quiteyounger than you.

Whatyou talkin' about? Thirty-two
years old. Best shape ofmy life.

Hey, stop!
All right, back up.

Did you see Muhammad Ali?

Here's yourwater.
Oh, thankyou, hon.

Bottled water.
Frozen steaks.

Brought all that stuffin
like Africa's ain't got no steaks.

You could pick up parasites.
Mobutu eats it.

Mobutu's takin' care of Mobutu.

He steals all the wealth
and sends it to Switzerland.

What that got to do
with any ofwhywe here?

We are here 'cause Don King
got Mobutu to put up $1 0 million.

Don King don't care about Africa.
He's worse than Herbert.

Here come Herbert.

And Don King fit right in too.

Now he's a dashiki-wearin' rip-off.

Don King delivered the first-ever...

black-promoted
championship fight in Africa.

Don King talks black,
lives white and thinks green.

And you're defending him
and Brother Herbert?

'Cause clean-cut Muslims in a parade
on the South Side ofChicago...

ain't gonna get this done!

I got to put honkies with connections
and bad-ass niggas to it.

And now they matched you up
against George Foreman.

Doyou think they give a damn
ifyou get killed?

So that's whatyou think?

I just wanna know why
my Muslim husband...

is allowing himself
to get strung up on a cross.

Just tell me why.

Maryum's sick.

Maybe I ought to go back
to Chicago and look after her?

Sure.

Well, then I guess
I'll be back before the fight.

Ifthat's all right, my husband.

This fight is no contest!

He is entirely too slow to fight me.

I say that George Foreman
is a mummy.

He's too slow.
You know I name all my fighters.

I'm gonna call George Foreman
"The Mummy."

He fight like a mummy.

And when I see George throwin' punches,
this is what I hear:

Here come the left.

Here come the right.

But the mummy can't hit
what the mummy can't see...

'cause I'm too fast for him.

I'm too fast.

I'm too fast. I'm too fast.
I move too good for him.

I'll hit George Foreman so many times,
he'll think he's surrounded.

He gonna say, "Call the police!
It's five of'em in here!"

I'm bad, man. I'm bad!

Muhammad, I'm sorry.
I have to ask.

Areyou really
fast enough anymore...

to beat George Foreman?

Ifhe gets you against the ropes,
he can knockyou out with either hand.

Many people believeyou're not the man
you used to be ten years ago.

See, now, Howard...

I didn't even want to talk
about this, man.

Especially not out here
in front ofall these people.

But I talked toyourwife...

and she said you not the man
you used to be twoyears ago!

Champ.

Champ, George had an accident.
He-- He had what?

What areyou talking about?
He got cut right above his right eye.

His sparring partner's elbow
split it open.

Can he fight?
Not for six weeks.

This is not a humorous situation,
my champ.

This postponement could be long,
especially ifGeorge leaves.

You trying to
pull something here, Don?

IfGeorge leaves, he ain't comin' back.
George don't like it here.

How rightyou are, my suspicious
and short ltalian brother.

Look here, man,
my fiduciary responsibility...

to this first all-black promotion...

is analogous to a garden in the African
sun-- it must grow, it must bloom.

Cannot flower in the gloom and shade
ofpostponement to the Astrodome...

or any dome out ofZaire where it be
deprivileged oflight and bled ofwater.

'Cause what gonna be bleedin' out of
there is money-- a hemorrhage ofcash.

I'm talkin' about blood on the floor.

Double hotel costs, airplane,
travel costs, food and beverage.

So what doyou want us to do?
Muhammad Ali. The people's champion.

My black brother.

I need you.
I need your strength.

I need you to find a way
to get George to stay.

Be Moses in reverse.

Do not let my people go.
Keep them the fuck right here in Egypt.

Ifyou'll pardon my Swahili.
Lingala.

Saywhat?
They speak Lingala.

Ali wants his title,
and he wants it in Zaire.

Okay, all right, okay.
Let's take it back.

George go, George go.
Hell, I can getyouJoe Frazier.

Ali-Frazier 3.
That's the fight everybodywant to see.

We don't want Frazier, we want George.
Hell, I don't control George Foreman.

There's been an accidental injury
to George Foreman in training.

The truth is...

George knocked hisselfout.

That's right.

He did three rounds, realized
he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali...

and knocked hisselfout.

I predict that when the fight is set,
he might not show.

Oh, you bad.

That's right, I'm a bad man.
Ain't no doubt about that.

Yeah, butyou tell George
the same thing.

I heard you.
I been watching you.

I know he's your man, I knowyou got
him picked, but the man is in trouble.

The whole world was gonna know,
but now he ain't gonna show.

In order to ensure that George is ready,
we are thinking ofpostponing...

from September 24 to October 30.

What about the concert?

The concert will go on as planned.
Those dates are September 20, 21 --

I want all the helicopters guarded,
all the private planes, private boats.

I'm serious.
I want the airports--

I want President Mobutu
and all his paratroopers--

All you Zaireans,
y'all be on guard too.

Any strange boats creeping away,
they might be taking him out.

Bus stations.

And bus stations!

Right.
Watch the bus stations.

The elephant caravans-- They might be
trying to take him out on an elephant.

What'd you say?
Hell, I ain't talking toyou.

Hey. Hey, man.

Don'tyou never talk
to Angelo like that.

Don'tyou never talk to Angie
like that again.

Something wrong with you, man?

Thinkyou callin' some shots here?
You ain't callin' nothin'.

They all know.

All them ladies out there,
they know I'm ready.

I see fear in the eyes
ofhis followers.

This was supposed to be the fight
that Muhammad Ali was ended.

Supposed to be Muhammad was gonna fall.
Supposed to be my destruction.

Well, they miscalculated.
They misjudged.

They got it wrong.

Hold on a second.

What's your name?

Veronica Porche.

Porche. Like the sports car.

Yes.
Withjust a little something extra.

Hey, you with Don?

Don brought me here,
but I'm not with anybody, no.

Whereyou come from?
LA.

LA?
But my people are from Louisiana.

Louisiana.

What, you Creole?

We're Creole,
so I'm African, French and Spanish.

My mother's grandfatherwasJewish.

Well, they mixed all that stuffup
in there real nice.

I'm the onlywitch doctor here.
Bundini Brown.

Bundini Brown
is an authentic witch doctor.

You tell 'em.
The only one in the United States.

I'm real glad
you said whatyou did.

You made sure the fight stays here.

You know all them reporters
and writers in there...

they say George
is gonna kill me.

Whatyou think?

Mr. Ali? Mr. Ali?

We want thankyou.
Hey, fella.

Y'all wanna thank me?

Y'all gonna thank me?
What I did?

They thanking me for something.

Hey, you ever been down to Hong Kong?
Thailand? Taiwan?

No.
No? I can't go there.

Hi, Ruthie. How areyou?
Hi, champ.

What's going on?
I'm great. Howyou feeling?

When I go to sleep,
this closes up.

That's what happens. When I go
to sleep, all this rests together.

During the day, I got to think.

Get me out ofthis country.
All the women so pretty.

All of'em, they got hair come all
the way down to the back oftheir knees.

All of'em-- All of'em
about Veronica's complexion.

Every single one of'em.
Bad, man.

But ain't nothing like the sisters.

Ain't nothing like the sisters.

Come on. Why don't we go
take a ride or something?

Wanna come with me?

Ruth, tell us the truth.
Is this your kind ofguy?

More cushion for the pushin'.

What'd he say?

So whyyou so glad
we still here?

Making the fight stay here
in Africa--

Anybody can fight in Vegas.

Well, that's onejob.
I got two.

Got to whup George.

Islamic faith helpyou do that?

Listen, girl, as a Muslim
I am failed in the eyes ofGod.

I should've discovered lslam at 50,
'cause I'm weak on women.

First they take my eyes.

My heart follow.

Making me the lovingest husband
in the world...

and the most terriblest husband
at the same time.

Look atyou.

Green eyes.

Cocoa skin.

Okay, rest ofme, let's go.

Rumble, Ali.

Mrs. Ali.
Hello, Muhammad, Mr. Cosell.

Hey, when you get in?

And I learned we now have this suite
at the lntercontinental Hotel.

Muhammad, may I have
a word with you, please?

Yeah.

What's goin' on?

What doyou mean,
what's goin' on?

Doyou have to throw it
in my face?

Do I have to read about it? Do people
have to call me on the phone to tell me?

I didn't mean for that
to come out.

And I live with the casual ones.
I live with 'em.

So why doyou
disrespect me like this?

I respectyou.
I will always respectyou.

Doyou love her?
