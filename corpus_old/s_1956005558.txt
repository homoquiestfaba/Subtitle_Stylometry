GLOVER:
<i>Five bedrooms, tennis court.</i>

<i>It's almost 25 acres of woods.</i>

What's an acre?

Mom?

It's a measurement of land.

Uh, it's like the size
of someone's property.

GLOVER: I thought
Grandpa lived in the city.

He did.
Uh, he kept this place

as, like, a...
like, a vacation house.

So why are you selling it?

Because it's part
of the estate,

and that's what you do
when someone passes away.

But why are <i>you</i> selling it?

Because it reminds her
of everything she hated

about her father.

Really?

What? That's what you said.

Just because your grandfather
and I didn't get along

doesn't mean I hated him.
If you died,

I wouldn't sell our house.

Hmm. I would.

She's just ornery
'cause she was supposed to see

her boyfriend this weekend.
Whatever.

He's not my boyfriend.

Then why did he make you
a playlist?

Filled with... sex songs.

Oh, my God.
Shut up, freak. Mom.

Okay...
Mom!

Seriously, I'm gonna kill you.
Okay, enough,

both of you.

I know this is not
how you wanted

to spend your weekend,
but guess what.

Me, neither.

So, a whole playlist?

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

All right, we're here.

(GATE OPENING)

â™ª â™ª

Grandpa had horses?

SHAUN:
Mm-hmm.

Sold them after I left.

â™ª â™ª

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

(GROANS SOFTLY)

You grew up here?

Mm-hmm. What do you think?

Seems lonely.

(ALARM BEEPING STEADILY)



(STEADY BEEPING CONTINUES)

What's wrong?

I don't know. Stay here.

(STEADY BEEPING CONTINUES)

The power must have went out.

Hey, Jas, can you see if
you can turn that thing off?

I get first dibs
on the bedroom.

Whatever. Nobody cares.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hi, Maggie.

MAGGIE: You guys get in okay?
Yeah, just a few minutes ago.

I hope traffic wasn't too bad.

No, we missed most of it.
Oh, good. Good.

Listen, if it's
all right with you,

I'll drop off
the paperwork tonight.

We should be able
to have the house

on the market
as soon as next week.

Shaun, are you there?

Yeah, that sounds good.

Okay. Well, I just
want to say again

how sorry I was
to hear about your father.

All right, well,
we'll see you tonight.

(JASMINE GROANS)
(PHONE BEEPS)

Thank God there's
some cell phone service.

Girl, you just got
your phone privileges back.

Don't abuse them.

Listen, I'm gonna need
you and Glover's help

this weekend
to get the house ready.

(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY
OVER EARBUDS)

What? I heard you.

Good. You can start
by unloading the car.

Is that a request
or an order, madam?

I am your mother.
Is there a difference?


Now, please.

Thank you.
(SIGHS)

Mom...

Yes, Jas?

Never mind.

Hey, hey.

Look, it's not your job
to worry about me.

It's my job to worry about you.

Okay?

All right.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

(MECHANICAL THUMP, WHIRRING)

Did I do that?

(MECHANICAL THUMPING)

Glover, did you do that?

Glov? Glov?

(THUMPING AND WHIRRING STOPS)

(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

Glov?

â™ª â™ª

(QUIET THUMP IN DISTANCE)

â™ª â™ª

(OVER SPEAKERS):
â™ª I can't see anyone but you â™ª

Glover, is that you?
GLOVER (CALLS): In here!

â™ª Sha bop sha bop â™ª

â™ª Sha bop sha bop... â™ª

This place is a fortress.

What are you doing in here?
The downstairs windows

have retractable
polycarbonate shields.

It's a fully automated
security system.

Check it out.
â™ª Are the stars... â™ª

There's cameras in every room,
the yard, the driveway,

interior motion detectors,

exterior motion-activated
lights, electronic deadbolts.

Where's that music coming from?

This controls everything.

The music, the lights,
the whole house.

It's so easy,
even you could do it.

Hmm.

(MUSIC STOPS)

Awesome, right?

I guess some people
get paranoid in their old age.

So what does that make you?

Nearly paranoid?
All right, smart-ass,

find another place to play.

Come on.
I'm hungry.

SHAUN: I'll order a pizza.
That'll take forever.

SHAUN:
I think you'll survive.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

(LOCK WHIRS, CLICKS)

(LINE RINGING)

JUSTIN:
Hey. I'm still at the office.

Yeah, I figured.

Oh, looks like
most of the weekend.

How was the drive?

The, uh, the kids still alive?

For now.

How is it?

It's weird. (CHUCKLES)
I bet.

You okay?

Yeah. Tired is all.

Well, listen,
sweetheart, the...

the D.A. called this morning.

Justin, I don't want
to do this. Please?

Shaun...
No, don't.

I'm barely hanging on as it is.

He was the criminal, Shaun.
How could you have known?

From the moment your mom died,
you were on your own.

Your father needed someone
to blame, and he chose you.

You survived. You got out.

You built a family, a life.

Then why does it feel
like I never left?

What he did, what he's done,
is not your fault.

You don't have to pay
for his mistakes.

Babe, I just want
to get through the weekend

and come home.

You know I would be there
if I could.

I know.

I should go.

Sweetheart?
Yeah?

You'll get through this.

Call me tomorrow.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Jasmine!

Glover!

Can you hear me?!

Oh, oh.

I'm gonna get you out.
I'm gonna get you out.

Okay? Move back. Move back.

Mom!

(MECHANICAL THUMP, WHIRRING)

Mom!

I'm gonna get you out, okay?

(GASPING, GRUNTING)

(CAR ALARM BLARING)

(CAR ALARM CONTINUES BLARING)

EDDIE:
<i>She's the old man's daughter.</i>

That's bad fucking luck.

Mom's. Found it in the garage.
She made two calls.

One was to the father,
the other was local.

And Pete?
I don't know. He should've been back by now.

Did you call him?
No. He doesn't have a phone.

Thinks the NSA is listening
to him or some shit.

What do you want to do?
Thought you said

no one came up here without the old man.
Yeah.

That's the information
I was given.

The information you were given?

I was banging the assistant.
It's not like I knew the guy.

You knew he stashed
$4 million cash in a safe

somewhere in this house.

Or are you not sure
about that, either?

How about we ask the kids?

You know where the safe is,
sweetheart?

SAM: They never been up here.
I told you.

The old man didn't talk
to his family.

Clearly, you're
a fucked-up tweaker

with inaccurate information,
so why don't you

shut the fuck up.
Enough. Enough!

(PANTING QUIETLY)

Come on, now.

I'm not gonna hurt ya.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)



(SCREAMS)
(GRUNTS)


Bitch!




(GLASS CRACKLES)
(PETER GROANS)


Phone.

You have a phone?

EDDIE:
<i>Situation has changed.</i>

But the objective's the same.

We find the safe,
we get the money,

we get the fuck out.

What about them?

DUNCAN:
They seen our faces.

That's a problem.
What are you saying, man?

That we should solve the problem.
They're kids.

Jesus, Eddie, where the fuck
did you find this guy?

I found him
the same place I found you,

doing three to five in county.

Only he wasn't on his knees
in a shower stall.

Look, this is
way beyond a break-in.

The minute we cut
those phone lines,

the clock started ticking.

If we don't get them
back online in 90 minutes,

the security company's
gonna call the police.

Yeah. You're right.

And Pete should've been
back by now.

Maybe we should bail.

Can we open the safe
without him?

No. We can't.

(ELECTRONIC CHIMING)

What was that?
The intercom.

Stay with the kids.

(ELECTRONIC CHIMING CONTINUES)

(BEEP)
(CHIMING STOPS)

Hello?

(OVER INTERCOM):
Hello?

Who is this?

SHAUN:
My name is Shaun Russell.

I don't care who you are or
what you're doing in my house.

Please just let my children go.

Front gate.

supposed to be here, Shaun.

Sorry for that.

This has nothing to do
with you or your kids.

Then just let them go.

Okay? We'll just walk away.
No police.

No one will ever know.
I promise.

Can't do that, Shaun.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

But if you come back
to the house,

I will not hurt your family.

Then why'd your guy
try to kill me?

Is he alive?
I want to talk to my children.

I want to know
that they're okay.

about my guy, okay?

We're not gonna hurt your mom.

Just want to bring her back.

Mom?

Baby, are you okay?
Did they hurt you?

No.

Your brother?

He's okay.

Mom, I want to go home.

I know. I know.

Everything's gonna be okay.
Mom! They're coming...

Wait, Jas!

Now... is my guy still alive?

SHAUN:
Yeah.

Good.

That's very good.

What do you want?

I want you to listen.

EDDIE:
<i>Now, I imagine in this moment</i>

you're questioning whether
or not you and your kids

will make it out of this alive.

The answer to that depends on
who I am, what I'm capable of.

You're thinking,
"If not me, then...

"at least my kids.

"At all costs,

get them back,
no matter what I have to do."

But you know
there is nothing you can do.

You are a woman, alone,
at the mercy of strangers.

Your greatest weakness
is trapped here

inside this house with us.

We will work this out,
I promise.

But from this moment on...

you are going to have to do
exactly what I say,

or you and your kids
will not survive this night.

Do you understand?

Do you understand me?

DUNCAN (OVER INTERCOM):
She's gone.

What about Pete?
I don't know.

There's a lot
of fucking nature out here.

Find him.

Well, Duncan was right.
We do have ourselves a problem.

What about the woman?
The house is locked down.

She can't get within 15 feet
without setting off

the security lights.
So?

So, when she does,
we solve the problem.

Now, we're on the clock, okay?

Right now our priority
is to find that safe.

What if she goes
looking for help?

We have her kids.
She's not going anywhere.

Take the kids upstairs.

(MUFFLED GRUNT)

(LOUD GRUNTING)
Just calm down.

Calm down.


I'm gonna remove the gag.

If you scream,

I put it back and walk away.
You understand?


How many are there?

They're not gonna find you.

Not out here.

How much longer
you think you're gonna last?

So that's what you want to do?
You want to die tonight?

Help me. Please.

Four.

There's four of us.

What do you want?

A safe.

Somewhere in the house.

Are they gonna
kill my children?

I don't know.

Hey, listen to me.

I don't know you.

I don't know anything
about you.

But these guys,
they're for real.


So... you let me go,

I'll take you back.

We'll figure something out.

Okay?

You got no other way
out of this.

(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

Hey.
You're right. You don't know shit about me.

(MUFFLED GRUNTING)

(GLOVER GRUNTS)

What the hell
is wrong with you?

(DOOR CLOSES)

Where's Mom?

â™ª â™ª

Hi. It's Maggie.

Maggie.

EDDIE (OVER PHONE):
Let her go.

Get back to the house.

Shit. Shit.

(MUSIC PLAYING OVER CAR STEREO)

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Hoping â™ª

â™ª That we'll be
together soon... â™ª

Look. Somebody's here.

Is it the police?

(TURNS OFF ENGINE)
(MUSIC STOPS)

(CAR DOOR OPENS)
I don't think so.

Oh. Sorry.

Hi.

I'm looking for Shaun Russell.

I'm Maggie Harris,
the real estate agent.

EDDIE:
Right.

Uh, Shaun said you'd be coming.

She, um, ran into town

to get some groceries.
Oh.

Isn't that her car
in the driveway?

Yeah. She was having
some problems with it,

so I let her take mine.

I'm Mark, by the way.
I'm a friend from Chicago.

I just came to help out
with the move.

Oh. She didn't mention...
I'm sorry.

You want to come in?

You know, I don't want
to trouble you.

It's not any trouble at all.

I'm sure if she knew
you were here, she'd...

she'd come right back,
you know, for your sake.

I'm sorry?
It's just that you traveled all this way.

You might was well... come in.

No.

Eh?
Yeah, okay.

She just left, you said?
Yeah.

She shouldn't be long.

Um, actually, it's late.

I'm just gonna
call her tomorrow.

You sure?
Yeah.

SHAUN (QUIETLY):
Go, Maggie. Go.

All right. Good night.

Help us!

Help!



DUNCAN: Warm night.
(SCREAMS)

OPERATOR:
911.

(MAGGIE GASPS)

(KNIFE SLICES)

He killed her. Didn't he?

We have to get out of here.

Okay, if we can get
the lock open,

we can find a phone
and call the police.

(BREATH TREMBLES)

Glover.

We can't call the police.
They cut the phone lines.

I left my cell
in the other bedroom.

Holy shit, man! What the fuck
happened out there?

I told you
not to let her leave.

I didn't say
cut her fucking throat.

She was just gonna walk, man.

DUNCAN: What you think
is going on here?

We broke into this house.
We took those kids.

Cops come, and we're
staring at 25 to life,

whether this bitch is dead
or tied up in the basement.

Moms didn't show.

I had to make a call,
so I made it.

I didn't bring you on
to make fucking calls.

Those kids upstairs...
that's all Mom cares about.

She would never do anything
to risk their lives.

She was afraid.

And that... put us in control.

Now, any question that she
might have about our intentions

is gone, and that
makes her fucking desperate.

DUNCAN:
So what?

So fear I can manage.

Desperation,
whole different thing.

I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

Of course you don't.

From now on, just do
as you're fucking told.

From now on, I'm gonna do
what I gotta do to get mine.

EDDIE:
We have less than an hour

before the security company
calls the cops.

If we don't find that safe,
nothing else matters, right?

What about Peter?

We find the safe,
then we find Pete.

And Mom?

Did you understand
a word I just said?

Clean up your fucking mess.

You want the arms or the legs?

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

DUNCAN:
Come on.

I think I got it.

Ow. Shit.

This isn't working.

We'll keep trying, okay?

Just see if you can find
something smaller.

What happens
if they find the safe?

(THUMPING, CLATTERING
IN DISTANCE)

(SAM GRUMBLING)

Where is it? (GRUNTS)

Okay, what is this place?

Shit.


â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

(THUMP IN DISTANCE)

What?

Maybe the information
I got was bad.

Maybe there is no money.

The old man was under
investigation by the D.A.

Liquidated all his cash.

You don't do that unless you're gonna keep it.
I know.

But maybe the assistant
was lying.

Maybe she was...
trying to impress me.

Somehow I doubt that.

You know what I'm saying.

We did our homework.
The money's here.

It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

Yeah, you're fucking
telling me.

What-what is it?
What do you want?

He's a fucking psycho.

Don't worry about him.

Till he slits my throat, right?

He killed that woman out there.

Now, if I'm Mom,
I'm thinking...

I'm thinking no matter what
I do, I'm gonna be dead, too.

So maybe I stay before,
but now...

I know I got to go get help.

Moms don't run.

Not when their babies
are trapped in the nest.

Okay, look. You came to me.

You needed a crew.

Now... it's your turn.

So go find the safe and stop
wasting my fucking time.

Okay?


(QUIET TAPPING ON GLASS)

You got to be fucking
kidding me.

Yo! Eddie!

(LIGHTS CLICK OFF)
(WHOOSHING)

(QUIET CRACKLING)
Hmm? Oh!

(LOUD POPPING)

Holy shit!

She's shooting at us!

(LOUD POPPING CONTINUES)

(LOUD POPPING STOPS)

Is that Mom?

Those weren't gunshots.
(LIGHTS BREAKING OUTSIDE)

She took out the lights.

We should've killed them
the moment they walked in here.


Here she comes. Find her.

Where's the breaker box?
Back entry.

Go.

Come on. Come on.

(LINE RINGS)

Yeah. Get back here.

She's in the house.

Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait here.

I'm gonna go get my phone.
No.

I'm gonna call the police.
Please.

Glov. I'll be back, okay?

What if something
happens to you?

I'm your big sister.

It's my job to worry about you,
not your job to worry about me.

Whatever, freak.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

â™ª â™ª

(BOARDS CREAKING)

â™ª â™ª

Where's my phone?

(QUIET THUMP NEARBY)

(MUFFLED GASPING)
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

It's me, baby. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

Are you all right?
Yeah.

Glover? Did they hurt you?

He's in the other room, Mom.
I'm so scared.

I know, baby.
What are we gonna do?

We're gonna get your brother,
and we're gonna get

the hell out
of this house, okay?

Okay. Okay.

Shh, shh, shh.

(FOOTSTEPS IN DISTANCE)

Was that them?
Are they coming?

They're gonna kill us.
No, no, no.

I'm not gonna let that happen, okay?
Mom...

No, no, no, no.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

EDDIE (IN DISTANCE):
Shaun?

What if they can't get
the safe open?

If they can't get what they
want, why would they let us go?

What do you mean,
if they can't open the safe?

That's what they said.

EDDIE (IN DISTANCE): Shaun?
Are you sure?

All right, all right.

You got it?

Mom, Mom, you can't leave us.

Oh, baby, I promise you, it'll
be just for a little while.

Mom, Mom, Mom, no,
there has to be another way.

Jas, listen to me.
There is no other way.

You got to take care
of your brother, okay?

Mom, I can't. I can't.
Yes, you can.

Yes, you can.
You hear me? You can.

Oh, Mom.

Baby, you are strong,
you're smart.

You are everything
I could have ever hoped for.

You're my daughter.
You can do this.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

(DOOR CLOSES)


Where's your sister?

(TOILET FLUSHING)

Hello?

Eddie?

â™ª â™ª

(DOOR CLOSES IN DISTANCE)

â™ª â™ª

Tell me the kids are
still locked in the bedroom.

What if we...

EDDIE:
Where is she?

Where is she?

I don't know.


She was in the house,
goddamn it.

Tell me where the fuck she is.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
All I have to do is push.

Don't!
Wait, wait, wait. Please.

Please don't hurt us.

I'll tell you
where the safe is.

(LOW WHIRRING)

You knew this was here
the whole time...

and you're just telling us
about it now?

Not exactly.

My mom told me where it was.

Did she happen to tell you
the combination?

No.

But she wants you guys
to stop trashing the place.

SAM:
Hello?

Nice. You found the safe.

What?

(MUFFLED GRUNTING)

All right.
Let's go for a walk.

(MUFFLED GRUNTING)

DUNCAN:
<i>We'll use the kids.</i>

Take them to the porch.

Kill the boy,
and Mom will fall in line.

No fucking way, man.
We're not killing fucking kids.

You didn't have a problem
killing the old man, did you?

That was different.
Why?

Because you weren't driving the car?
No, because

if the D.A. had investigated
him and he told them

about the safe, this whole
thing would've been blown.

We didn't have a choice.
30 fucking minutes,

and the cops show up.
Either we do

what's gotta be done,
or we turn ourselves in.

Why would she tell us where the safe is?
Who fucking cares?

She's smart.

Knows how to handle herself.

She knows about Peter.

I did.

SHAUN:
Tree line, side of the house.

(LINE CLICKS)

â™ª â™ª

There she is.


Got to say, I didn't think
you'd make it this far.

Yeah, you and everybody else.

Growing up in this house,
the man your father was...

Guess I was wrong.
Still, you must be wondering

if I'm capable
of killing this man.

And that depends
on what you want

and what you're willing
to do to get it.

You know exactly what I want.

Otherwise, we wouldn't be
standing here.

Where are the other two?

In the house.

You're smarter than that.

Tell them to step out
into the light.

You heard the lady.

Now, your friend here,
he's losing a lot of blood.

I don't know
if you care about his life,

but I do know that you care
that he's the only one

who knows how to open the safe.

Listen, Shaun...

I want to end this
as much as you do.

Great.

You tell my children
to come outside.

And you don't touch them.

We'll walk into the woods,
and you don't follow.

When we're in the clear,
I'll let him go.

And how do I know
I can trust you?

You don't. But you know you'll
do whatever you have to do,

because there's
nothing else you can do.

You're a man at the mercy
of a woman, whose...

greatest weakness has a
fucking saw to his throat.

(SHAUN SHRIEKS)


Let her go.

â™ª â™ª


Keep running, Shaun!

You just killed your kids!

Their blood is on your hands!

SAM: The assistant kept
encrypted copies of his codes

at her apartment.

The computer runs
a dummy protocol.

Peter wrote a new code
that'll bypass

the safe security lock.

Theoretically.

(KEYBOARD CLICKS)
How long is this gonna take?

30 seconds.

If it works.

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

(LOCK CLICKING, WHIRRING)

(LOCK CLANKS, BEEPS)

We're in.

(BREATHY CHUCKLE)

So that's what
the American dream looks like.

Bag it.

(LIQUID SPATTERING)

Tie the kids to their beds.

Light the house on fire.

(MUFFLED WHIMPERING)

Just another family tragedy.

Hey.

Be honest, I don't like this
any more than you do.

But it has to be done.

And that bag
you're holding means

life without worry
from here on out.

No more 12-hour shifts.

No more sucking up
to those rich motherfuckers

who think they're better
than you are.

No more being on your knees.

Don't look at them.
(MUFFLED WHIMPERING)

They don't matter.
Look at me.

I said look at me.

We good?

All right,

let's get this done.
â™ª Sha bop sha bop â™ª

What the fuck was that?

(OVER SPEAKERS):
â™ª Sha bop sha bop â™ª

â™ª Sha bop sha bop... â™ª

This bitch doesn't know
when to give up.

Stay here.

â™ª Are the stars... â™ª

You find her...

you cut her in fucking half.

â™ª Sha bop sha bop â™ª

â™ª I don't know
if it's cloudy or bright â™ª

â™ª You are here â™ª

â™ª Sha bop sha bop â™ª

(MUFFLED GRUNTING)

â™ª Sha bop sha bop â™ª

â™ª Maybe millions of people â™ª

â™ª Sha bop sha bop â™ª

â™ª Go by â™ª

â™ª But they all disappear â™ª

â™ª From view... â™ª

Shut up!

(MUFFLED GRUNTING)

Shut up.

Shut up!

I'm coming. Mom's coming.
Mom's coming, okay?

I'll be right there.
I'll be right back.

Going somewhere?

No, I was just... just...

You were what?

There was a...

a noise.

Where?

I'm gonna drop the rope down.

Okay? I'm gonna drop
the rope down.

(DUNCAN GRUNTS,
SHAUN SHRIEKS)

(SAW CLATTERS IN DISTANCE)

â™ª â™ª

There's nowhere left to go.

(GLOVER GASPS)

â™ª â™ª

Shit.

No, you-you don't
have to do this.

First time is the hardest.

You got what you came here for.
Just... you can just leave.

She's right.

There's no reason
she has to die.

They all gotta die.

(JASMINE GASPS)

Go, go.

You're not a killer.

You don't want to do this.

Please.

I don't know, man.

Do it, or you're fucking next.

Go. Hurry. Hurry.


(EDDIE GRUNTS)

Stop!

Last chance.

Yeah. All right.

EDDIE:
Relax, kid.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

"We tie the kids to their beds,
light the house on fire"?

If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead already.

I want to get you out of this.

But you're gonna
have to trust me.

So just relax, okay?

Give me... give me the gun.

Put the gun down.

Shoot him! Shoot him!
Give me the gun.

Give me the gun.

Go! Go!

Keep going! Run!

Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!

We're almost there!

(CAR ALARM CHIRPS)

Okay, get in.
Come on, Glov, hurry.

Put your head down, Glov.

Get down.

Mom?
They got what they came here for.

They got their money.
They're gonna leave us alone.

Mom. Mom.

(GUNSHOT OUTSIDE)

EDDIE: I'm gonna get in the house, Shaun!
(GUNSHOT)

I will get in that house!

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

We're safe now, okay?

We're okay now, okay?
We're safe.

(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

Okay.

Mom?

Just stay here, okay?

Oh, no.

No.

No. Justin.

No. Baby, no.

Shaun? Shaun!

No! Justin!

Shaun.

Run! Run!
Shaun! Shaun!

Run!
Open the door. Open the door.

Run! Run!
What is going on? Open...

Open the door.
EDDIE: It's been a hell of a night.


So... where are the keys?

Who are you?
What do you want?

Where... are the keys?
My wife...

(BONE CRACKS)
(JUSTIN SCREAMS)

Daddy?
Kids, get back!

EDDIE:
I know you can hear me.

Obviously, you can see me.

Open the door,

or I am going
to kill your husband

in front of you
and your fucking kids.

You don't want to see him die.

Don't do it, Shaun!
Don't listen to him!

Look, you're
an impressive woman.

You've done everything you can.

You've done enough.

JASMINE:
Mom.

Mom, just give him the money.
He's gonna kill us anyway.

You don't know that, Mom.
You don't know.

You got to get out of here.
You got to take Glover.

You got to run
as fast as you can.

What?
You run as fast as you can,

and you don't stop for anyone,
do you understand me?

Mom... Mom,
what are you gonna do?

EDDIE:
Open the goddamn door!

Don't you hurt my family!

(HINGES CREAKING)

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

I know what you're trying
to do, Shaun.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

This isn't gonna work!

You're done!

(SWITCH CLICKS)

â™ª â™ª

So your plan was...
to draw me upstairs,

set the house on fire.

Sounds like something your dad
might have thought of.

Good plan.

The money is doused
in gasoline.

You come any closer
and I'll burn it.

You do that,
you and your kids are dead.

And you walk away with nothing.

Or... I could just shoot you.

And the money burns.

After all this,
is that what you want?

Shaun.

How far do you think
your kids'll get?

Your husband?

Now, you want me to believe

that you're capable of letting
your entire family die

just so I don't get
what I want.

After tonight, it's quite clear
you have no fucking clue

what I'm capable of.

Me and everybody else.

Right?

Glover, wait, wait.

Dad.

Drop it.

(CLIP CLATTERS ON FLOOR)

(GUN CLICKS)
(BULLET CLINKS ON FLOOR)

I meant what I said.

You're an impressive woman.

No. I'm not.

I'm just a mom.

Now, get the fuck
out of my house.

(KNIFE STABBING)

(BODY THUDS)

(KNIFE SHEATHES)

He had it coming.


(LOCK CLICKS)

See, I was walking
back here, thinking,

"Even though this bitch
ran me over,

see, I'm gonna make it quick."

And that boy, too.

It ain't his fault.

But, now, your girl,

see, I might have
some fun with her.

(POKER CLANKS ON FLOOR)

Now, I'm thinking,
let's make it a family affair.

Where do you think
you're going?


Daddy. Daddy.

(SHAUN GRUNTING INSIDE)

â™ª â™ª



All night trying
to get back into this house

to save your kids...

...only to end up
trapped inside with me.


I wish I had a mother like you.

DUNCAN: Get up here.
JASMINE: No, please.

Don't fight me.

Please don't. No.

Hold still.
Please don't.

Relax.
No.

No, you don't have to do this.

You don't have to.

It'll be okay. Relax.
Please.

All I want to do is push.
Please, don't. No, please.

Just hold still, huh?


(JASMINE GRUNTS)


SHAUN (QUIETLY): I do
what I can to protect my kids.

Do you have something to say?
Yeah.

You broke into
the wrong fucking house.

(KNIFE STABS)
(GRUNTING)


(BODY THUDS)


Come here, baby.
Come here. It's okay.

It's okay.

â™ª â™ª

JUSTIN:
Shaun.

It's okay. It's okay.

It's okay. It's okay.

I'm okay.

I'm okay now.

We're okay.

I'm okay.

I'm okay.
