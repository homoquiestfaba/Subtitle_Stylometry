TROUBLE OR ANYTHING.            

        THE FRONT IS IN TROUBLE.

          WE CAN'T DO OUR

HEY.                            

YOU GUYS UP FOR A               
PRE-GAME SHAKE AT THE SHACK?    

      Linda: WOW.               
      SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.       

<i>Heather:</i>                        
<i>YOU GUYS COMING?</i>                

             NO. Y'ALL GO AHEAD.
             I'M ON A DIET.     

   ALL RIGHT.                   
   I'LL SEE YOU AT THE GAME.    

   Hannah: WHAT IS WITH HER?    
   WHAT DID I SAY?              

UH, I DON'T KNOW.               

SHE'S PROBABLY ON HER           
PERIOD OR SOMETHING.            

DON'T EVEN SWEAT IT.            

WHAT DO YOU SAY, UH,            
YOU AND I BE ALL LIKE, HEY      

AND GO BACK TO MY PLACE         
BEFORE THE GAME?                

      UM, I ACTUALLY TOLD       
      LINDA AND HEATHER         

      WE'D GO GET A SHAKE.      
      DO YOU WANT TO COME?      

NO. I'LL PROBABLY JUST GO TO    
MIKE'S AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES     

OR SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT?        
LATER, BABE.                    

              BYE.              

       CAN WE SAY CHOAD?        

WOULD ONE OF YOU PLEASE         
TELL ME WHO THE HELL GINNY IS   

AND WHAT HAPPENED               
BACK THERE?                     

     UH, I NEED A SHAKE.        
     DIET'S OFF. LET'S GO.      

       ( ducks quacking )       

  HUH, OKAY, SO YOU KNOW HOW    
  SOMETIMES LIKE SERIOUS SHIT   

      GOES DOWN IN THESE        
      LITTLE PODUNK TOWNS       

    AND NOBODY EVER WANTS       
    TO TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN?     

YEAH. KIND OF LIKE MY           
MOM IS WITH MY DAD.             

            EXACTLY.            

   OKAY, SO LAST YEAR BEFORE    
   YOU MOVED HERE,              

THE PRINCIPAL'S DAUGHTER, GINNY,
WAS KILLED HALLOWEEN NIGHT.     

SHE WAS MURDERED?               

        NO. SHE DIED            
        IN AN ACCIDENT.         

IT WAS ALCOHOL RELATED,         
WASN'T IT?                      

THAT'S WHY YOU                  
DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME.         

I MEAN, WHEN WE MET             
BACK IN AUGUST,                 

YOU WERE STILL SO UPSET         
OVER YOUR DAD.                  

IT JUST NEVER                   
FELT RIGHT.                     

      SO WHY DID TINA GET       
      SO UPSET EARLIER?         

   I MEAN, WERE THEY FRIENDS?   

       <i> WE WERE ALL HER FRIENDS,</i>

  AND I GUESS IT'S STILL JUST   
  HARD FOR US TO THINK ABOUT.   

  I MEAN, GINNY WAS ONE OF THE  
  SWEETEST, SOFTEST,            

      MOST GENUINE PEOPLE       
      YOU'D EVER MEET.          

   I DON'T THINK THERE WAS      
   A SINGLE PERSON AT SCHOOL    

   WHO DIDN'T JUST ADORE HER.   

                 HELL, EVEN     
                 TINA LIKED HER.

SHE WAS ON THE CHEERLEADING     
SQUAD, WASN'T SHE?              

THAT, THAT'S WHY GRAVES         
LOOKED AT US SO WEIRD EARLIER.  

       I MEAN, GINNY WAS CAPTAIN
       OF THE JV SQUAD          

 SINCE WE WERE FRESHMEN, AND    
 THE APPLE OF HER DADDY'S EYE.  

                           YEAH!

            THAT MAN USED TO BE 
            ONE EASY-GOING CHAP,

         BUT HE'S BEEN GRIM AS  
         ALL GET OUT EVER SINCE.

YEAH. IT KIND OF                
REMINDS ME OF MY MOM.           

I MEAN, HE SEEMED TO BE HOLDING 
IT TOGETHER PRETTY WELL TODAY.  

                 YEAH. WELL,    
                 SOMEONE HAD TO.

                 OUR BUDDY, BEN,

      DAMN NEAR FELL APART RIGHT
      BEFORE OUR VERY EYES.     

WHO'S BEN?                      

       BEN YOUNGBLOOD. YOU KNOW,
       AS IN RICK YOUNGBLOOD,   

          THE HONKY TONKY FARMER
          DATING YOUR HOT MOM?  

             WAIT.              

  I DIDN'T KNOW RICK HAD        
  ANOTHER SON OTHER THAN MARK.  

  WELL, MARK WAS ACTUALLY       
  A YEAR YOUNGER THAN BEN WAS.  

     BEN WAS IN OUR CLASS.      

     WAS?                       
     WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?      

               AFTER GINNY DIED,

           BEN'S WAGON SNAPPED  
           RIGHT OFF IT'S HITCH.

     WHAT HE MEANS IS THAT      
     BEN WENT TO REHAB          

        AND NOT THE KIND        
        WHERE CELEBS GO.        

 JANITOR FRED FOUND A BUNCH     
 OF DOWNER MEDS IN HIS LOCKER.  

      SUPPOSEDLY, IT WAS        
      WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS MOM'S

PRESCRIPTION PILLS THAT SHE OD'D
ON WHEN SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE   

A FEW YEARS BACK.               

        DIARRHEA MOUTH.         

              GOD.              

NO WONDER RICK'S BEEN           
SO SYMPATHETIC TO MY MOM,       

BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE HE NEVER    
MENTIONED HE HAD ANOTHER SON.   

  HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO PUT    
  THAT ON HER AFTER EVERYTHING  

Y'ALL WENT THROUGH WITH YOUR    
DAD ANYMORE THAN WE DID YOU.    

       OR MAYBE HE TOLD HER, AND
       SHE JUST DIDN'T TELL YOU.

             PARENTS HAVE A     
             WAY OF HIDING SHIT.

                I'M JUST SAYING.
                OKAY?           

SO, WHERE'S BEN NOW?            

              HE NEVER RESPONDED
              TO THE REHAB.     

<i>HE JUST SITS IN THIS DARK QUIET</i> 
<i>ROOM PAINTING PORTRAITS</i>         

      <i> OF OLD GINNY GRAVES.</i>     

SO HE JUST LEFT HIM THERE       
IN THE NUT HOUSE?               

           IT'S NOT A NUT HOUSE.

    MORE LIKE EXTENDED STAY     
    IF HE WAS SUICIDAL.         

GEEZ, THAT'S HEAVY.             

DO YOU GUYS THINK I SHOULD      
SAY SOMETHING TO MY MOM?        

  DUDE, YOUR MOM BARELY LET     
  YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE AS IT IS.

   HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING 
   TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING LIKE,

            HEY MOM, GUESS WHAT?

   I TOOK SOME DEAD CHICK'S SPOT
   ON THE CHEER SQUAD TODAY.    

       RUNS OF THE MOUTH,       
       REMEMBER.                

 ALTHOUGH HE DOES HAVE A POINT. 

HEY, DID YOU GUYS               
SEE THAT?                       

 I THOUGHT I JUST SAW SOMETHING 
 BEHIND THOSE TREES OVER THERE. 

I DON'T SEE NOTHING.            

       OKAY. NOW, I'M OFFICIALLY
       FREAKED.                 

         CAN WE GET OUT OF HERE,
         PLEASE?                

      ( heavy breathing )       

SO, YOU THINK PETER WILL LIKEY? 

<i>AFTER ALL THOSE SLICES</i>          
<i>OF SAUSAGE AT BIGGIE'S,</i>         

   WHAT I THINK IS PETER IS     
   SAUSAGING YOUR STEPSISTER.   

             WHAT?              

            NO WAY.             

<i>Linda: WHY NOT?</i>                 

 VICKIE'S FREE LOVING           
 FEARLESS SCREAMS, "SCREW ME."  

 BECAUSE PETER WOULD NEVER BE   
 INTO A TREE HUGGER LIKE VICKIE,

AND LIKEWISE, VICKIE WOULD NEVER
BE INTO A JOCK LIKE PETER.      

ALL I'M SAYING IS I HAVE        
IMPECCABLE EYES AND EARS.       

 YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE
 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE.     

AND NEITHER HAVE YOU.           

JUST BECAUSE YOU BEEN SAVING    
YOURSELF FOR PETER PAXTON       

SINCE KINDERGARTEN DOESN'T MAKE 
YOU SOME DAMN FOOL IN LOVE.     

IT JUST MAKES YOU               
A<i> DAMN FOOL.</i>                    

       THERE'S NOTHING          
       WRONG WITH WAITING       

       UNTIL YOU'VE FOUND       
       THE RIGHT PERSON.        

UNLESS IT MEANS YOU'RE THE ONLY 
VIRGIN LEFT IN HOGEYE HIGH.     

    SO YOU THINK THAT PETER     
    WANTS TO SCREW VICKIE       

 BECAUSE HE THINKS SHE'S EASY?  

NOT BECAUSE                     
SHE'S EASY                      

BUT BECAUSE SEX WITH HER IS     
DIFFERENT THEN SEX WITH YOU.    

SEX WITH YOU IS LIKE            
SHOOTING A BUNNY,               

GUARANTEED TO BE                
GREETED WITH GUILT.             

     WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT      
     THAT TONIGHT               

      WHEN I HOOK UP WITH       
      HIM, WON'T WE?            

HUH, I'LL BELIEVE THAT          
WHEN I SEE IT.                  

YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THE ONLY    
GUY YOU'RE HOOKING UP WITH      

THIS WEEKEND IS JESUS COME      
CHURCH SUNDAY MORNING.          

    AND YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.     

       YOU HAVEN'T DATED        
       IN OVER A YEAR.          

THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S          
A LACK OF BROTHERS              

IN THIS HICK ASS TOWN.          

I DATED A FEW, BUT THEY'RE ONLY 
GOOD FOR ONE THING, THE BOOTY.  

      ( knocking at door )      

             ENTER.             

HEY, YOU GUYS MIND IF I CATCH A 
RIDE WITH YOU TO THE GAME LATER?

       BUT YOU NEVER COME       
       TO THE GAMES.            

 WELL, MAYBE I WANT TO SEE MY   
 STEPSISTER IN ACTION FOR ONCE. 

      OR JUMP IN YOUR           
      STEPSISTER'S ACTION.      

      OF COURSE YOU CAN.        

   THE ONLY THING IS WE KIND    
   OF HAD PLANS AFTERWARD.      

  THAT'S FINE.                  
  I CAN FIND MY OWN RIDE HOME.  

 SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THE     
 COSTUME BALL AFTER ALL, THEN?  

NOT THIS YEAR.                  

    APPARENTLY, TINA PLANNED    
    A PRIVATE PARTY FOR US.     

       AND WHY HAVEN'T I        
       HEARD ABOUT THIS?        

MAYBE BECAUSE TINA DOESN'T WANT 
THE WHOLE SCHOOL TO KNOW.       

             RUDE.              

           OH, SPILL.           

<i>WHERE IS IT?</i>                    

     I DON'T KNOW.              
     SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.      

     Linda:THANK YOU,           
     THANK YOU, THANK YOU.      

Krissey: YOU MEAN TO TELL ME    

YOU HAD YOUR HANDS ON OUR       
SCHOOL MASCOT UNIFORM,          

AND YOU DIDN'T BRING IT TO      
COME TRICK OR TREATING?         

         Jeff: SORRY. I HAD TO  
         LEAVE IT AT THE SCHOOL.

          SOMEONE GOT FAKE BLOOD
          ALL OVER THE PONCHO,  

           BUT HEY, IF YOU LIKE,

       I CAN GO GET MY COOL     
       TRAINER T OUT OF THE CAR.

           IT'S JUST DOWN THERE.

THANKS, BUT I NEED              
CANDY COLLATERAL,               

NOT A TRAINER WITH              
SWEATY TACKLES.                 

             YO, SMARTY PANTS.  
             WE ALMOST FINISHED?

                I GOT TO GET TO 
                THE SCHOOL SOON,

           AND I MIGHT NEED     
           YOUR HELP PICKING OUT

           AN OUTFIT            
           RIGHT AFTER THE GAME.

OOH, FOR A GIRL?                

                MAYBE, BUT YOU  
                CANNOT TELL MOM.

WORDS WILL NEVER HURT           

PROVIDED WE HIT AT LEAST ONE    
MORE BLOCK OF BIG HOUSES.       

                 HMM, FINE,     
                 YOU GOT A DEAL.

       SUCKA!                   

      THIS IS GOING             
      TO BE A LONG NIGHT.       

    MIKE, WHERE'S THE BOOZE?    

DIDN'T GET IT YET.              

       WHAT? DAMMIT, MIKE       
       YOU SAID...              

BABE, I GOT                     
MY BROTHER'S ID.                

WE'RE GOING TO TAKE             
CARE OF IT LATER.               

      YOU'RE ACTING LIKE        
      IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.      

 WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING 
 TO LOOK OLD ENOUGH BECAUSE YOU 

 WERE HELD BACK FOR TWO YEARS?  

  WHAT ABOUT YOU, BLAINE?       
  DID YOU DO WHAT I ASKED YOU?  

  ONLY THROUGH THE MASTERMINDING
  AND MANIPULATION.             

        IT'S OURS FOR THE NIGHT.

          ( doorbell )          

        Children:               
        TRICK OR TREAT.         

     Girl:                      
     WHERE'S YOUR COSTUME?      

COSTUMES ARE FOR PRE-ADOLESCENCE
AND PERVERTS, PRINCESS.         

   HAPPY HALLOWEEN, KIDDIES.    

            KEYS...             

   AND HAPPY HALLOWEEN, TINA.   

<i>Nancy:</i>                          
<i>HANNAH, COME ON IN HERE.</i>        

<i>YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE.</i>        

COMING.                         

HANNAH, I DON'T                 
WANT YOU GOING OUT              

AFTER THE GAME TONIGHT.         

BIG STORM'S                     
COMING THROUGH.                 

         BUT MOM, YOU SAID      
         AS LONG AS BLAINE      
         HAD ME HOME BY MIDNIGHT

                  THAT I COULD, 
                  I COULD GO.   

HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO GET        
A CHEERLEADING SCHOLARSHIP      

WHEN YOU'RE HANGING OUT         
WITH A BOY ALL THE TIME?        

    <i> MOM, BLAINE'S THE RUNNING</i>  
    <i> BACK FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM.</i>

             I COULDN'T GET MUCH
             MORE SUPPORT UNLESS
             I DATED THE MASCOT.

   BLAINE IS VERY SUPPORTIVE.   

   SUPPORTIVE OF ONE THING...   

GETTING INTO YOUR               
CHEER BLOOMERS, DEAR.           

        MOM, WE'RE JUST GOING TO
        GO TO BIGGIE'S BARBECUE 

              FOR A WHILE, OKAY?

                 NO COW TIPPING.

              NO HOUSE WRAPPING,

             NO MAILBOX BASHING,
             I PROMISE.         

      NO. MADE UP MY MIND.      

           MOM,                 
           IT'S HALLOWEEN NIGHT.

         I MEAN, DIDN'T YOU AND 
         DAD GO OUT AFTER GAMES?

I COULD'VE CHEERED              
FOR THE COWBOYS,                

BUT INSTEAD                     
I MARRIED YOUR FATHER,          

AND NOW HE'S GONE.              

I JUST DON'T WANT YOU           
THROWING YOUR LIFE AWAY         

ON SOME BOY LIKE I DID.         

YOU ARE A GREAT CHEERLEADER.    
YOU ARE THE BEST.               

YOU CAN GO AND                  
BECOME A COMPETITIVE            
JUDGE OR SOMETHING.             

TRAVEL THE WORLD,               
DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE.    

                   DO YOU REGRET
                   MARRYING DAD?

           I MEAN, DO YOU REGRET
           HAVING ME, TOO?      

NO, YOU KNOW THAT               
I LOVED YOUR FATHER.            

I DON'T REGRET                  
MARRYING YOUR DAD,              

AND OF COURSE,                  
I DON'T REGRET HAVING YOU.      

EVERYTHING THAT                 
I HAVE DONE IS FOR YOU.         

I MOVED US HERE FOR YOU         

SO THAT YOU CAN                 
HAVE A BETTER SHOT              
AT GETTING A SCHOLARSHIP.       

BUT I'VE HEARD                  
NOTHING BUT BAD THINGS          

ABOUT THESE NEW FRIENDS         
OF YOURS, AND I'M AFRAID...     

I'M AFRAID THAT                 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE           

A BAD INFLUENCE                 
ON YOU, OKAY?                   

SO, NO. YOU'RE NOT GOING        
OUT TONIGHT, AND THAT'S IT.

WAIT.                           
WHY DOESN'T SHE DRINK?          

  HER DAD WAS KILLED ON         
  JULY 4th BY A DRUNK DRIVER.

       -HOLY SHIT.

       OH, HEY, SHERIFF.        

        EVENING, LADIES.        

     HAVE EITHER OF Y' ALL      
     SEEN LINDA OR HEATHER?     

 NO. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF      
 THE GIRLS, NOT SINCE THE GAME. 

   -IS EVERYTHING OKAY?         
   -<i> YEAH. I'M JUST WONDERING</i>   

     WHAT KIND OF TOILING       
     TROUBLE LINDA'S INTO.      

   WELL, WE HAVEN'T SEEN 'EM.   

  THEY MIGHT BE AVOIDING        
  A SCHOOL DANCE AFTER THE WAY  

    GRAVES TREATED THEM         
    AT THE PEP RALLY TODAY.     

        YEAH?                   
        AND HOW'S THAT?         

     HE'S DROWNING              
     WITH HIS MELODRAMATIC      
     BOUT OF GUILT IS ALL.      

NOT THAT IT WOULD HAVE MATTERED 
IF THEY WOULD'VE SHOWED UP      

     CONSIDERING PRINCIPAL      
     GRAVES ISN'T HERE.         

     HE'S PROBABLY AT THE       
     CEMETERY WAILING OVER      
     HIS DAUGHTER'S GRAVE.      

                        TYPICAL.

    <i> Robin: BESIDES, YOU</i>        
    <i> SHOULDN'T BE INTIMIDATED</i>   

       BY A BARF BAG            
       LIKE BLAINE, JEFF.       

      YOU SHOULD JUST           
      ASK HER OUT ANYWAY.       

AND WHAT MAKES YOU              
THINK I'M SO INTERESTED         
IN HANNAH TO BEGIN WITH?        

    UH, BECAUSE LINDA           
    TOLD ME THAT YOU BOUGHT     
    A HOMECOMING CORSAGE        

   FOR A CERTAIN SOMEONE BACK   
   WHEN YOU THOUGHT HANNAH      

     HAD BEEN DUMPED BY         
     BLAINE FOR DANA STEEL.     

OKAY. I NEVER TOLD              
LINDA WHO THE CORSAGE           
WAS FOR, SO...                  

       WELL, SO,                
       WHO'S IT FOR THEN?       

     ( laughs ) YEAH.           
     THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.     

  LOOK, I SAY THAT YOU          
  OUGHT TO MAKE YOUR OWN        
  PASS PLAY ON HANNAH TONIGHT.  

              YES.              

   IT'S HAPPENING.              
   WE'RE MAKING THIS HAPPEN.    

                       OH, SHIT.

           PETEY'S TRUCK'S DOWN 
           THE OLD PARK 'N PUSS.

WHAT?                           

   <i> Blaine: I WONDER WHO THAT</i>   
   <i> OLD DOG'S BANGING TONIGHT.</i>  

          HE'S WITH VICKIE, DUH.

Blaine: OH, MAN!                

          GOD, NO WONDER HE KEPT
          THAT NEW ASS A SECRET.

YOU GUYS, WE DON'T KNOW         
FOR SURE PETER'S HAVING         
SEX WITH ANYONE, OKAY?          

    WELL YOU SURE AS HELL DOWN  
    DON'T GO DOWN THERE TO TALK.

                    I KNOW THAT.

              ( laughs )        
              GOD DAMN, HEATHER.

<i>FREAKING DUDE YOU BEEN IN</i>       
<i>HEAT FOR SINCE KINDERGARTEN</i>     

<i>IS BANGING YOUR SISTER?</i>         
<i>( laughs )</i>                      

            THAT'S SOME SPRINGER
            SHIT RIGHT THERE.   

    -SHE'S MY STEPSISTER.       
    -DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL.    

   PETEY DOESN'T LIKE           
   THEM CHURCH GOING CHICKS,    

    EVEN IF YOU ARE THE TIGHTEST
    PIECE OF ASS IN SCHOOL.     

           GET HIM IN ABOUT 10  
           OR 20 WHEN HE'S READY
           TO SETTLE DOWN.      

              I'M SURE HE'LL HIT
              YOU UP, ALL RIGHT?

  BLAINE. WOULD YOU PLEASE      
  STOP REFERRING TO OUR GENDER  

       AS PIECE AND ASS.        

              OH, BABY, COME ON.
              CALM DOWN.        

        IT'S JUST BULLSHIT      
        LOCKER ROOM TALK ANYWAY.

             BLAINE, SHUT UP    
             AND WATCH THE ROAD.

            OH, SHIT,           
            AND WE HAVE ARRIVED.

          BITCHES, WELCOME TO   
          THE PARTY OF THE YEAR.

           ( music )            

    Blaine: WHAT'S UP, BABY?    

               WELCOME TO HELL, 
               SHIT HEADS.      

      HAPPY FUCKING             
      HALLOWEEN, BITCHES.       

GOING TO OUR GRAVES             
REMEMBERING TONIGHT. HOLLA.     

     HOLY HICKS TOWN,           
     THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.     

         IF YOU ENJOY THE BOWELS
         OF LUCIFER'S LAYER.    

MIKE, YOU REALIZE YOU WERE      
DRIVING LIKE AN IDIOT, RIGHT?   

        SORRY ABOUT IT.         

            ANOTHER ROB         
            DONALDSON FREAK OUT.

             CHILL OUT, BIG RED.
             YOU'RE ALL RED.    

HANNAH, YOU TOLD YOUR           
MOM WE'D BE AN HOUR.            

<i>SHE'S GOING TO KILL US.</i>         

IT'S FINE, ROBIN, REALLY.       

WELL, I'M NOT EXPLAINING        
THIS ONE TO HER.                

COME ON, BABE.                  
LET'S JUST...                   

WE'RE HERE, RIGHT?              
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.            

COME ON.                        

      UH, BLAINE.               
      CAN I GET MY DUFFEL?      

         <i> Jeff: SO DO YOU GUYS</i>  
         <i> THINK I SHOULD LIKE...</i>

     I DON'T KNOW APPROACH HER? 
     WHAT SHOULD I SAY?         

       YOU NEED TO OFFER        
       TO TAKE HER HOME         

     BECAUSE HER MOTHER         
     IS GOING TO FREAK OUT.     

BLAINE, DID YOU                 
SEE MY CELL PHONE?              

IT WAS IN MY BAG EARLIER.       

               NO. I DON'T KNOW.
               MAYBE YOU LEFT IT

             IN THE GIRLS LOCKER
             ROOM OR SOMETHING. 

HEY, TAKE MY TRUCK, OKAY?       

TAKE MY TRUCK.                  
I'LL STAY HERE.                 

I DON'T...                      
I DON'T HAVE SERVICE.           

        OH NO. THE WOODS MUST BE
        BLOCKING OUR RECEPTION. 

                       WHOOPSIE.

GREAT. WHAT AM I                
GOING TO DO NOW?                

   NO. DON'T LOOK AT ME.        
   I CALLED THIS AN HOUR AGO.   

                WHAT DO YOU WANT
                TO DO, BABE?    

            WE JUST GOT HERE,   
            AND I'M NOT LEAVING.

      UM, IF YOU REALLY         
      NEED TO GO, HANNAH?       

<i>MAYBE BUBBA AND ROBIN</i>           
<i>CAN STAY HERE AND DRINK</i>         
<i>AND RIDE BACK WITH THE REST,</i>    

    AND I CAN TAKE YOU NOW      
    IF BUBBA DOESN'T MIND ME    
    BORROWING HIS TRUCK?        

YEAH. JUST, UH,                 
LEAVE IT IN THE PARKING LOT     

AND PUT THE KEYS                
IN THE TIRE.                    

UM, THANKS, JEFF.               

IT... IT'S FINE.                
I'LL... I'LL STAY.              

       I MEAN, MY MOM'S         
       ALREADY REALLY MAD AT ME,

AND SHE NEEDS TO LEARN          
THAT I'M ALMOST AN ADULT.       

                 THAT'S MY GIRL.

SORRY, DUDE.                    

SO LET'S GO CHECK               
OUT THIS HELL HOUSE.            

      DON'T CALL IT THAT.       

SPOOK HOUSE.                    

        STILL NOT FUNNY.        

               HELP ME OUT, MAN.

                  OH HEY, BABE, 
                  YOU COMING?   

I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.      

                      ALL RIGHT.

        ( eerie music )         

     HEY BRAD, HEY BROTHER.     

   YOU GIRLS ARE GOING TO       
   MAKE ME SO RICH SOME DAY.    

                        SHERIFF?

          THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
          WITH HANNAH, DOES IT? 

NO, NANCY. SORRY.               

I, UM, ACTUALLY CAME TO         
HAVE A WORD WITH YOU, RICK.     

IT'S ABOUT YOUR SON, BEN.       

           YEAH. WHAT ABOUT HIM?

BEN?                            
WHO THE HELL IS BEN?            

HIS REHAB HAS BEEN TRYING       
TO REACH YOU ALL DAY.           

IT WOULD APPEAR                 
THAT YOUR SON, UH,              

LEFT YESTERDAY EVENING.         

THE SHRINK SAY HE MIGHT'VE,     
UH, RETURNED HERE ON FOOT.      

I GUESS IT'S SAFE               
TO ASSUME                       

THAT HE HASN'T TRIED            
TO CONTACT YOU?                 

    RICK, YOU NEVER TOLD        
    ME YOU HAD ANOTHER SON.     

               HE'S SICK, NANCY,
               AND I DON'T LIKE 
               TO TALK ABOUT IT.

                HE LIVES IN     
                A CARE FACILITY.

DO YOU HAVE ANY                 
CLUE WHERE YOU SON              
MIGHT'VE GONE?                  

I GOT A COUPLE                  
OF MY DEPUTIES OUT              
LOOKING FOR HIM NOW.            

            WHY? WHAT DID HE DO?

HIS SHRINK IS                   
JUST CONCERNED                  

THAT HE MIGHT BE                
HARMFUL TO OTHERS.              

NOW, I'VE NEVER KNOWN           
YOUR SON TO BE DANGEROUS.       

PERHAPS YOU                     
CAN ENLIGHTEN ME.               

        YOU JUST TELL YOUR      
        BLOODHOUNDS TO KEEP     
        THEIR DAMN PAWS OFF HIM.

        HE'LL LISTEN TO ME.     
        I JUST GOT TO FIND HIM  
        BEFORE HE DOES ANYTHING.

YOU WOULDN'T MEAN               
ANYTHING HAVING TO DO           
WITH MY LINDA NOW, WOULD YOU?   

       NOW, LOOK HERE, SHERIFF. 
       I KNOW YOU COVERED       

      FOR THEIR ASSES BECAUSE   
      LINDA IS YOUR KID AND ALL,

                BUT BEN DON'T   
                SEE IT YOUR WAY.

          THAT DON'T MEAN HE'S  
          DANGEROUS NOW NEITHER.

YOUR SON WAS JUST               
AS RESPONSIBLE AS               
THE REST OF 'EM,                

AND FOR THE RECORD,             
MY DAUGHTER, HEATHER ZANN,      

ROBIN DONALDSON,                
THEY'RE GOOD GIRLS.             

THEY DIDN'T MEAN                
FOR IT TO HAPPEN.               

            I GET THAT, SHERIFF,

      BUT YOU GOT TO LET ME MAKE
      SENSE OF THAT TO MY BOY.  

THAT'S FINE, BUT I              
INTEND TO KEEP MY FAMILY        
AND MY JURISDICTION SAFE.       

             GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
             WASTING MY TIME.   

      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?      

       TO CALL MARK AND TELL    
       HIM TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT.

        YOU GET YOUR JACKET.    
        WE'RE GOING TO FIND HIM.

SORRY ABOUT THIS, NANCY.        

JUST KEEP HIM FROM              
DOING ANYTHING STUPID.          

                      THANK YOU.

             WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

WHAT'S GOING ON?                

                  WE SHOULD NOT 
                  BE DOING THIS.

DOING WHAT?                     
WE'RE TEENAGERS.                

THIS IS WHAT TEENAGERS DO.      

         AND WHAT ABOUT HEATHER?

             WHY ME AND NOT HER?

             I MEAN, SHE'S WAY  
             PRETTIER THAN I AM,

              AND YOU KNOW SHE'S
              IN LOVE WITH YOU. 

I DON'T KNOW.                   
HEATHER'S GREAT.                

SHE'S THE TYPE OF GIRL YOU      
TAKE HOME TO YOUR MOTHER,       

NOT JUST THE PARK 'N PUSS.      

              ( laughs )        
              YOU PIECE OF SHIT!

                 AND WHAT? I AM?

           YOU'RE A BIGGER SLUT 
           THAN I AM.           

( laughs ) NO.                  

WE AIN'T SLUTS.                 

WE JUST ROCK STARS.

     -NO THANKS.                

     Blaine: YEAH, BABY.

YOU GUYS KNOW

     SHE DOESN'T WANT ONE. OKAY?

   YOU GET THE LIGHTER FLUID,   

      AND YOU AND BUBBA GO

          BABE, THERE'S SUPPOSED
          TO BE A CHANCE FOR    
          RAIN TONIGHT.         

BABE, IT'S A 60%                
CHANCE OF RAIN,                 

BUT THERE'S 100% CHANCE         
MY LITTLE CHEERGINA             

IS GOING TO BE ALL CLOSED UP IF 
YOU JUST DON'T DO IT ALREADY.

TINA, YOU KNOW I DON'T          
LIKE KNIVES.

        SO I CAN MAKE A         
        JACK-O-LANTERN.         

TINA, THANKS.                   

     SO EASY.                   
     I KNEuW YOU'D LOVE IT.     

FINE. TRY AND HIDE              
YOUR BUSINESS,                  

BUT IT'S WRITTEN ALL            
OVER YOUR FACE.                 

YOU LOVE SOMEBODY.              

   MAYBE IF SOMEBODY HAD A      
   RELATIONSHIP OF THEIR OWN,   

    SHE WOULDN'T BE SO BROWN    
    NOSING EVERYBODY'S SHIT     
    ALL THE DAMN TIME.          

I'M SORRY,                      
WAS THAT A RACIAL SLUR?         

   TAKE IT AS YOU LIKE, DEAR.   

OKAY, GIRL. I'VE HAD            
JUST ABOUT ENOUGH.              

     HEY, LET'S GO EXPLORE      
     THE HOUSE.                 

I THOUGHT YOU                   
HATED THE HOUSE.                

       I CHANGED MY MIND.       

GIRL, YOU BEST BE GLAD          
I JUST WASHED MY UNIFORM.       

              BYE.              

DUDE, IT'S FUCKING              
GO TIME.                        

                  DON'T YOU MEAN
                  BLOW TIME?    

YEAH.                           
ALL RIGHT.                      

THAT WAS SO SWEET OF JEFF TO    
OFFER TO DRIVE ME HOME EARLIER. 

            <i> Robin: I KNOW.</i>     
            <i> JEFF'S A SWEET GUY.</i>

YEAH, BUT I ALWAYS              
THOUGHT HE DIDN'T LIKE ME.      

HE ALWAYS ACTS SO               
WEIRD AROUND ME.                

               HANNAH, MY SWEET,
               SWEET FRIEND,    

               SO CLOSE YET     
               SO VERY FAR AWAY.

      JEFF HAS ALL BUT PROFESSED
      HIS UNDYING LOVE FOR YOU, 

              <i> AND YOU THINK HE</i> 
              <i> DOESN'T LIKE YOU?</i>

         WHAT? NO WAY.          

                        YES WAY.

    BUT, I MEAN, HE WOULD'VE    
    TOLD ME, RIGHT?             

     I MEAN, BLAINE SAYS I      
     LOVE YOU ALL THE TIME.     

     IT'S EASY TO SAY I LOVE YOU
     WHEN WHAT YOU ACTUALLY LOVE

               IS SO VERY       
               ORIFICE SPECIFIC.

       EW, ROBIN, GROSS.        

             IT'S TRUE, BUT JEFF
             ISN'T LIKE THAT.   

          HE'S DEEPER THAN THAT,

               AND IT'S NOT EASY
               TRYING TO WEAR   

          THOSE KIND OF EMOTIONS
          ON YOUR SLEEVE.       

        BUT HE DOESN'T          
        EVEN TALK TO ME.        

          LIKE HOW HEATHER      
          DOESN'T TALK TO PETER?

         OH, WOW.               
         YOU'RE RIGHT.          

       HOW CAN I BE SO...       

                      OBLIVIOUS?

YEAH.                           

                WE'RE TEENAGERS.
                IT HAPPENS.     

          OKAY, CAPTAIN OBVIOUS,
          ARE YOU READY?        

             YEAH.              

             LET'S GO ROAST SOME
             MALLOWS, SHALL WE? 

          ( moaning )           

OH, HEATHER.                    

MY GOD, VICKIE.                 

OH SHIT!                        

<i>OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.</i>               

SO, WHO HAS A GOOD              
GHOST STORY.                    

<i>Linda:</i>                          
<i>OH, I GOT ONE.</i>                  

      ONCE UPON A TIME,         
      TWO BRAINLESS BOOBS       

      SCREWED WHAT LITTLE       
      BRAINS THEY HAD           

    RIGHT OUT OF EACH OTHER,    

 AND THEN THEIR LOVE CHILD WAS  
 UNLEASHED INTO THE UNIVERSE.   

          ( laughing )          

       Robin: OH MY GOD.        

    -MIKE'S CONDOM BREAKING!    
    -OH GOD.                    

THAT'S AS SCARY AS IT           
GETS ON HALLOWEEN.              

                 BROPHY, SHAKES 
                 ON THE DEFENSE.

SHUT UP, YOU KNOW I HATE        
IT WHEN YOU TALK THAT SHIT.     

NOW FOCUS ON MY ROCKING         
BODY WITH EVERY MOVE.           

    SO HARD SOMETIMES WITH      
    THIS ROCKING PHYSIQUE, BABE.

GOD, YOU'RE PERFECT             
FOR ME.                         

            BABY, WON'T YOU     
            COME INSIDE WITH ME?

            I THINK WE NEED SOME
            MORE MARSHMALLOWS.  

NO, WE DON'T.                   
WE HAVE PLENTY.                 

           THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH 
           WITH YOU AROUND, RED.

                  HEY, WATCH IT,
                  BOCHNER.      

        WHY DON'T YOU CHILL OUT,
        CAKE BOY?               

          COME ON, BABY, PLEASE?
          I NEED A HAND.

                   COME ON,     
                   BABY, PLEASE.

I THINK SHE MADE HER

<i>Jeff: BESIDES,</i>

YOUR SNOW BOOGERS

       WHY DON'T YOU SHUT       
       THE HELL UP?             

           HEY. DON'T EVEN THINK
           ABOUT IT, BLAINE.    

      YOU KNOW WHAT?            
      FUCK ALL Y'ALL THEN.      

        Hannah: BLAINE.         

            THAT PRICK          
            REALLY CHAPS MY ASS.

         OH, HANNAH,

I CAN'T BELIEVE

     YOU'RE NOT STUPID.

YOU KNOW, BLAINE? DON'T         
EVER CALL ME AGAIN. EVER!       

    Tina: OH, JESUS.

WHY DON'T YOU MIND

           IT WAS JUST ONE LINE,
           OKAY, AND LOOK,

   THAT WAS JUST SEX.           

       DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

       <i> BEN BE DOING THIS.</i>      

 DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING TO DO 
 WITH THE PRINCIPAL'S DAUGHTER? 

  <i> I THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE DIED</i>  
  <i> IN A DRUNK DRIVING ACCIDENT?</i> 

      Tina: DRUNK DRIVING?      
      WE KILLED HER.            

       Hannah: YOU WHAT?        

Robin: WHEN YOU ASKED IF IT WAS 
ALCOHOL, WE JUST LET YOU ASSUME 

      THAT IT WAS A DRUNK       
      DRIVING ACCIDENT.         

       Hannah: SO WHAT          
       THE HELL HAPPENED?       

    Heather: IT WAS AFTER       
    THURSDAY NIGHT JV GAME.     

        WE WERE HAVING A        
        HALLOWEEN PARTY.        

       Hannah: WITH WHO?        

       Jeff: ALL OF US,         
       OUT ON THE FIELD.        

    <i> Blaine: WE WERE WASTED.</i>    

 <i> THE GIRLS WERE FOOLING AROUND,</i>
 <i> DOING STUNTS AND PYRAMIDS.</i>    

      <i> WE WERE THROWING THE</i>     
      <i> FOOTBALL BEHIND 'EM.</i>     

     <i> THIS IS BEFORE HERMAN</i>     
     <i> WAS A SOPHOMORE.</i>          

    <i> BEN WAS THE MASCOT THEN.</i>   

     <i> Heather: AND WE FELL.</i>     

  Hannah: YOU GUYS WERE DRUNK.  

    THAT'S LIKE MANSLAUGHTER    
    OR SOMETHING, ISN'T IT?     

     Robin: AND YOU'RE ALL      
     STILL MINORS.              

AND CERTAINLY NOT               
WHEN LINDA'S DAD IS...          
WAS THE SHERIFF.                

  Blaine: IF BEN WOULDN'T HAVE  
  BEEN FOLLOWING GINNY AROUND   

     ALL THE TIME LIKE SOME     
     STUPID ASS PUPPY,          

     THEN NONE OF THIS SHIT     
     WOULD'VE HAPPENED.         

    <i> Heather: BEN DIDN'T WANT</i>   
    <i> TO BE THE MASCOT.</i>          

   HE ONLY TRIED OUT BECAUSE HE 
   WANTED TO BE CLOSER TO GINNY.

       HE NEVER LIKED US NO     
       MATTER HOW HARD WE TRIED,

<i>ALWAYS CALLED US</i>                
<i>GINNY'S FRIENDS.</i>                

Tina: IT'S BECAUSE BEN          
YOUNGBLOOD WAS A FUCKING FREAK, 

             AND THE ONLY REASON
             GINNY DATED HIM    

           IS BECAUSE SHE WAS A 
           MOTHER FUCKING SAINT,

    AND SHE PITIED HIS POOR     
    PATHETIC OBSESSION OVER HER.

<i>OKAY. IT DOESN'T MATTER</i>         
<i>WHO'S UNDER THAT MASK.</i>          

WHAT MATTERS RIGHT NOW IS       
THE REST OF US GET OUT OF       
HERE ALIVE, OKAY,               

       ROBIN, YOU               
       SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.       

Robin: YOU JUST LOST            
YOUR DAD TO SOME OTHER          
IDIOT'S NEGLIGENCE.             

HOW COULD I TELL YOU            
THAT WITHOUT YOU THINKING       
I WAS AWFUL.                    

          WHAT DO YOU CARE?     
          YOU SCORED HER COVETED
          SPOT ON THE SQUAD.    

      I DON'T GIVE A SHIT       
      ABOUT THAT.               

Mike: GUYS, LOOK,               
HE'S OUT FRONT.                 

   WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?   

   Jeff: I THINK HE'S CUTTING   
   YOUR CABLES.                 

    DAMN IT, BLAINE.            
    YOU AND I CAN TAKE THIS     

      MOTHER FUCKER OUT         
      RIGHT NOW. LET'S GO.      

     NO WAY, MAN.               
     HE'S FUCKING WITH US.      

       <i> HE'S GOT A FUCKING</i>      
       <i> BOW AND ARROW.</i>          

      HE WANTS US TO COME       
      OUT THERE, MAN.           

  YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT,         
  BUT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.   

YOU'RE SUCH A BITCH.            

         <i> SO WHAT DO YOU</i>        
         <i> PROPOSE WE DO, BLAINE,</i>

            SIT AROUND AND SNORT
            SNOW AND PRAY TO GOD

              HE DOESN'T COME IN
              TO KILL US FIRST. 

        THAT'S EXACTLY          
        WHAT I PROPOSE.         

 I MEAN, SHIT, SOMEBODY'S GOING 
 TO COME LOOKING FOR US, RIGHT? 

             NOBODY KNOWS WE'RE 
             OUT HERE, REMEMBER?

     YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE,      
     YOU KNOW THAT BLAINE?      

  LINDA IS DEAD. BUBBA'S HURT,  
  AND YOU'RE STILL OVER THERE   

    TRYING TO RIDE A FUCKING    
    WHITE HORSE.                

       -FUCK YOU, HANNAH.       
       -FUCK YOU.               

  Heather: GUYS, STOP. NOW,     
  CAN WE ALL PLEASE JUST FOCUS  

       AND TRY TO FIGURE        
       A WAY OUT OF THIS?       

     <i> Mike: GUYS, HE JUST</i>       
     <i> SKIPPED BUBBA'S TRUCK</i>     

       AND WENT STRAIGHT        
       FOR BLAINE'S CAR.        

   Robin: YOU CAN ONLY POP      
   THE HOOD FROM THE INSIDE.    

    HE CAN'T CUT THE CABLES     
    WITHOUT THE KEYS.           

 THANK GOD. THAT'S OUR ESCAPE.  
 YOU HAVE BUBBA'S KEYS?         

              NO.               

    WE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING     
    TO TAKE YOU HOME.           

         FUCKING BRILL.         

       MAYBE HE LEFT            
       THEM ON THE TIRE.        

     <i> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, THEN.</i>    

 MAYBE ONE OF US CAN...I DON'T  
 KNOW, RUN AROUND THE FARMHOUSE 

  AND CREATE A DIVERSION LONG   
  ENOUGH TO CONFUSE HIM         

    AND THE REST CAN GO GET     
    THE KEYS OFF THE TIRE       

    AND WHEN THE BAIT COMES     
    AROUND THE FARMHOUSE,       

      THEY'LL JUMP IN,          
      AND WE'LL TAKE OFF.       

        <i> BUT BUBBA CAN'T</i>        
        <i> DRIVE LIKE THIS.</i>       

         YEAH, GUYS. I DON'T    
         THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

             BUBBA CAN HAVE A   
             SERIOUS CONCUSSION.

Mike: SHE'S RIGHT. I MEAN,      
THERE'S NO WAY TO GET THE KEYS  

    AND BUBBA INTO THE TRUCK    
    IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME       

   IT'LL TAKE THAT CRAZY FUCK   
   TO GET AROUND THE HOUSE.     

     <i> Jeff: SO THEN HEAD OUT</i>    
     <i> TO THE WATER.</i>             

   THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN   
   DISTRACT HIM LONG ENOUGH     

  TO ESCAPE AND GET SOME HELP.  

  <i> Mike: DUDE, RUNNING THROUGH</i>  
  <i> THAT OPEN FIELD</i>              

  WHEN HE HAS A BOW AND ARROW,  
  IT'S A SUICIDE MISSION.       

  Jeff: IT WOULDN'T BE FOR THE  
  FASTEST RUNNING BACK          

   IN THE ENTIRE 3A DISTRICT.   

            HELL NO.            

         FINE. I'LL GO.         

 Mike: OKAY, BUT WHERE ARE YOU  
 GOING TO GO?                   

  Jeff: I'LL GO OUT TO THE OLD  
  CABIN ACROSS THE LAKE.        

  IF I CAN MAKE IT ACROSS THE   
  WATER, MAYBE I CAN LOSE HIM.  

             I'M GOING WITH YOU.
WHAT?                           

HANNAH, NO. YOU SHOULD GET      
THE TRUCK AND GO GET HELP.      

             I'M NOT LETTING YOU
             GO OUT THERE ALONE.

            I'M COMING WITH YOU.
            I CAN KEEP UP.      

HANNAH, I DON'T WANT YOU        
RISKING YOUR LIFE, OKAY?        

     I'M SICK OF EVERYONE ALWAYS
     MAKING MY DECISIONS FOR ME.

    I'M GOING. IT'S MY DECISION.
    IT'S FINAL.                 

FINE.                           
WHO'S GOING TO GET HELP?        

               I WILL. ROBIN,   
               YOU COME WITH ME.

WHAT? WHY ME?                   

           <i> Tina: DON'T YOU WANT</i>
           <i> TO HELP BUBBA?</i>      

   <i> NO, THAT'S NOT WHY SHE</i>      
   <i> WANTS YOU TO GO WITH HER.</i>   

  IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A FAT     
  ASS. ODDS ARE BETTER ON TINA  

 IF OLD BEN TURNS AROUND        
 AFTER HE TAKES JEFF OUT FIRST. 

       BLAINE, SHUT THE HELL UP.

Robin: OH MY GOD.               
HE'S RIGHT, YOU BITCH.          

        FINE. FORGET IT.        
        I'M NOT GOING BY MYSELF.

BABE, YOU KNOW                  
I GOT YOUR BACK.                

  YOU KNOW WHAT? FUCK IT!       
  YOU CAN ALL JUST LEAVE THEN!  

 MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN GO DOWN     
 TO THAT PUB AND GET SOME HELP. 

      -IT'S NOT VERY FAR.       
      -GOOD IDEA.               

              AND I'LL STAY HERE
              AND HELP ROBIN    

             SINCE THERE'S AN   
             OBVIOUS SHORTAGE OF
             BALLS AROUND HERE  

             WITHOUT BUBBA AWAKE
             TO PROTECT US.     

      SELF-RIGHTEOUS CUNT.      

  THAT'S IT. ONE MORE FUCKING   
  WORD OUT OF YOU BARTON,       

      AND I'LL NAIL YOU         
      TO THE WALL MYSELF.       

     HEY, MIKE. LOOKS LIKE      
     THE RAIN'S LETTING UP.     

             OKAY.              

WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU GUYS TO LEAVE
AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE    

  AND THEN WE'LL BOLT FOR IT.   

      OKAY. UM, THIS IS PROBABLY
      NOT THE BEST UTENSIL      

      TO BE CARRYING WHEN YOU'RE
      RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE,    

          SO KEEP EVERYONE SAFE.

      YOU GUYS BRING HELP       
      FAST, ALL RIGHT?          

YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?            

                           YEAH.

YOU GUYS READY?                 
                         YEAH.  

        ON THREE.               
        ONE, TWO, THREE.        

HEY, ASSHOLE.

            MIKE, LET'S JUST GET
            HEATHER AND BLAINE. 

         THE FOUR OF US CAN     
         JUST MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

                        COME ON.

NO. IT'LL TAKE FOREVER TO       
GET BACK TO TOWN ON FOOT.       

   -NO, WE CAN...               
   -BUBBA NEEDS OUR HELP NOW.   

I'M NOT GOING TO                
LEAVE HIM AND ROBIN.            

        WE CAN'T BRING THEM ALL.
        THEY'RE TOO BIG. THEY'RE
        GOING TO SLOW US...     

I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO

           ( scream )           

             DO YOU THINK HE'S  
             STILL FOLLOWING US?

I DON'T KNOW.                   

HE WAS HEADED THIS WAY          
WHEN WE LEFT THE HOUSE,         

BUT I DIDN'T LOOK BACK.         

          WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?

I GUESS WE CROSS.               

    GET ON THE OTHER SIDE SO    
    IT'S EASIER TO PUSH OFF.    

OKAY.

      LET ME IN.                

           LET ME IN.

 RENOVATIONS? WHAT A SHIT HOLE. 

              UGH.              

YOU CHECK IN THERE, AND         
I'LL LOOK AROUND OUTSIDE?       

MAYBE THERE'S

DISPATCH JUST GOT A DISTURBANCE 
CALL AT CHRISTY'S PUB           

    <i> DOWN ON COUNTY ROAD 696.</i>   

   WHAT KIND OF DISTURBANCE?    

   <i> MYRTLE SAID SOME TEENAGERS</i>  
   <i> WERE HARASSING HER,</i>         

 <i> SAID SHE SAW A FEW CARS</i>       
 <i> TURNING DOWN RANCH ROAD 3000.</i>

     BEEN HEADING OUT

   WHY AREN'T THEY BACK YET?

 THE WOODS LIKE 20 MINUTES AGO. 

       THEY OUGHT TO BE         
       LONG DEAD BY NOW.

             I THINK HE'S LOSING
             TOO MUCH BLOOD.    

<i>I HOPE YOU</i>

MAYBE BUBBA

WE REALLY DON'T

        ( eerie music )         

ROBIN, BEHIND YOU,              
BEHIND YOU.                     

          ( screams )           

SHE MADE IT.                    

                  OH, SHIT.     
                  WHERE'D HE GO?

         ( starts car )         

          ( screams )           

          ( screams )           

        ( screams ) NO!         

    I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU.     

           I PROMISE.           

                   ROBIN'S DEAD.

                I CAN'T LET YOU 
                GO OUT THERE.   

I HAVE TO SEE IF THAT           
TRUCK WILL STILL RUN,           

OR WE'RE ALL DEAD.              
NOW MOVE.                       

                 YOU PEOPLE ARE 
                 FREAKING CRAZY.

        IF YOU GO OUT THERE, I'M
        NOT LETTING YOU BACK IN.

I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.           

I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GO        
BACK. WHAT IF THEY'RE...        

         I'M NOT GOING TO LET   
         ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU.

                      I PROMISE.

            HEATHER?            

        ( water splash )        

          OH, FUCK ME.          

             FUCK.              

<i>GLAD YOU'RE HERE.</i>               

          ( screams )           

          ( gurgling )          

          ( coughing )          

        ( starting car )        

           I NEED HIGHER GROUND.

        ( eerie music )         

       ( beeping sound )        
       SHIT.                    

         ( door opens )         

          ( screams )           

         BURN IN HELL.          

          ( gurgling )          

           ( spits )            

IT'S SO QUIET NOW.              

    IF MIKE OR TINA MADE IT,    
    THE POLICE WOULD'VE BEEN    
    HERE ALREADY.               

THEY WOULDN'T                   
HAVE COME AND LEFT?             

        ALL THE CARS            
        ARE STILL HERE.         

         WAIT, IS THAT?         

  BUBBA'S TRUCK IS UP           
  AGAINST THE TREE OVER THERE.  

          -OH MY, GOD.          
          -SHH.                 

    WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.     

        LET'S GO UP ON          
        THE FRONT PORCH.        

        ( eerie music )         

               ROBIN,           
               ARE YOU IN THERE?

        HEATHER? BLAINE?        

         BUBBA'S STILL HERE.    
         BUBBA, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

STAY WITH HIM.                  
I'M GOING TO TAKE               
A QUICK LOOK AROUND.            

                           YEAH.

       ( hard breathing )       

            ( gags )            

    WE NEED TO GET              
    BUBBA AND GO RIGHT NOW.     

                     WHAT IS IT?

BUBBA, PLEASE.                  

                           JEFF.

BLAINE, UPSTAIRS.               

             HERE.              

HANNAH, WE NEED TO              
GET THE GIRLS AND GET           
OUT OF HERE, OKAY?              

     JEFF, WAIT. THERE'S        
     SOMEBODY ELSE IN HERE.     

       -JEFF, BEHIND YOU!       
       -UGH.                    

             JEFF.              

              UGH.              

             JEFF.              

( screams )                     

             JEFF.              

             JEFF.              

              OOH.              

           ( gurgle )           

          (starts car)          

          ( coughing )          

              OOH.              

             BUBBA.             

        ( police siren )        

NO, BUBBA.                      

            HANNAH.             

BUBBA? NO.                      

  HANNAH, WHAT HAPPENED HERE?   

I KILLED HIM.                   

<i>YOU DID WHAT?</i>                   

     I THOUGHT HE WAS BEN.      

       HANNAH, I KNOW           
       THIS HARD FOR YOU,       

      BUT I NEED TO KNOW,       
      WHERE IS LINDA AT?        

    UNDER MY FEET, ASSHOLE.     

          ( screams )           

         HELLO, HANNAH.         

RICK, WHERE'S MY MOTHER?        

                OH, SHE'S AROUND
                HERE SOMEWHERE. 

IF YOU HURT HER...              
I SWEAR TO GOD.                 

              DON'T NEED TO BE  
              WORRIED ABOUT HER.

         <i> IF I WAS YOU,</i>         
         <i> I'D START WORRY ABOUT</i> 
         <i> NOT HAVING ANY FRIENDS</i>

             COME MONDAY MORNING
             FIRST PERIOD.      

HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?          

     DO I REALLY NEED TO        
     GIVE YOU A LIST OF REASONS?

          I SUPPOSE THAT'S FAIR.

            FOR STARTERS,       
            IT'S HUNTING SEASON,

                <i> AND HUNTING'S</i>  
                <i> JUST PLAIN FUN.</i>

           SECOND, THERE'S THIS 
           WHOLE MESS THAT THESE
           HEATHENS CAUSED      

           THAT MADE MY POOR BOY
           GO ALL LOONEY FARM.  

             DAMN MEDDLING KIDS.

         MADE MY FIRST BORN BOY 
         GO TO THE RETARD HOUSE,

      TARNISHING MY FAMILY NAME.

FAMILY NAME? PLEASE.            

LOOK AT YOURSELF.               

I'M PRETTY SURE YOU             
BOTCHED THAT ON YOUR OWN,       

YOU BACKWARDS                   
WHITE TRASH PIECE OF SHIT.      

                 OOH. WHERE DID 
                 THAT COME FROM?

             I DIDN'T THINK     
             YOU HAD THAT IN YA.

YOU WON'T                       
GET AWAY WITH THIS.             

            WHY?                
            MY BOY, BEN, DID IT.

YOU'D FRAME                     
YOUR OWN SON?                   

             HE DON'T SPEAK NOW.

     IT'S NOT LIKELY HE'S GOING 
     TO BE ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING.

YOU, STAND BACK.                

              AW, DAMMIT, NANCY.

       THINGS WERE JUST STARTING
       TO GET GOOD AROUND HERE. 

YOU PROMISED ME.                

                   MOM, YOU KNEW
                   ABOUT THIS.  

HANNAH WAS NOT                  
PART OF OUR DEAL.               

         WELL, SEEING ME WITHOUT
         MY MASK WASN'T EITHER. 

       <i> I TOLD YA TO PUT A LEASH</i>
       <i> ON THIS BRATTY LITTLE</i>   

   SHOVEL SLAYER OVER THERE.    

       I TOLD YOU TO MAKE       
       SURE SHE STAYED AT HOME. 

I DID, BUT SHE DIDN'T           
LISTEN, DID SHE?                

                 MOM, WHAT DEAL?

HANNAH, BUTT OUT.               

          <i> JUST TELL HER, NANCE.</i>

         THE STIFF CAT'S        
         HANGING OUT OF THE BAG.

YOU TALK TOO MUCH.              
JUST SHUT UP.                   

       YOUR MOM WAS             
       FREAKED OUT AS ALL       

      <i> GET OUT RIGHT AROUND</i>     
      <i> THE TIME I STARTED MAKING</i>

              CARNE ASADA OUT OF
              SENORITA SANCHEZ, 

       BUT A HANDFUL OF         
       THEM HAPPY PILLS,        

         <i> AND THEN SHE STARTED</i>  
         <i> REALIZING THAT YOU WAS</i>

         JUST ONE STEP CLOSE TO 
         THAT CHEER SCHOLARSHIP.

THAT'S ENOUGH, RICK.            

WE'VE FINISHED EVERYTHING       
WE CAME HERE TO DO, RIGHT?      

NOW, HANNAH AND I AREN'T        
GOING TO SAY ANYTHING,          

SO WE'RE GOING TO STICK         
TO THE ORIGINAL PLAN.           

BEN DID IT ALL.                 
UNDERSTOOD?                     

      -ALL RIGHT, NANCE.        
      -UNDERSTOOD, HANNAH?      

              UGH.              

              MOM?              

              MOM?              

I MADE A MISTAKE.               

                MOM, DON'T TALK.

               PLEASE. JUST KEEP
               YOUR EYES OPEN.  

             KEEP LOOKING AT ME.

I JUST, UGH, OH.                

I WANTED A BETTER               
LIFE FOR YOU.                   

                 ( crying ) MOM.

MOM, WAKE UP.                   

                        WAKE UP.

           WHAT? YOU DON'T THINK
           I'M SMART ENOUGH     

               TO WEAR A BULLET 
               PROOF VEST UNDER 
               THIS HERE PONCHO?

        YOU RUN ON HOME, HANNAH.

     I'M GOING TO STAY HERE     
     AND BUILD A BIG OLD BONFIRE

      STARTING WITH YOUR MOTHER.

           ( crying )           

    IF YOUR MOM HAD HALF        
    THE SPITFIRE AS YOU DO,     

  WE WOULD'VE HAD               
  OURSELVES A REAL GOOD TIME.   

         LITTLE INDIANS         
         ALL IN A ROW,          

      TEN IS ENOUGH             
      JUST WANTING TO GO.       

    THEY'RE ONLY TEN LITTLE     
    INDIANS, YOU SON OF A BITCH.

     I THOUGHT I'D ALREADY      
     TAKEN CARE OF YOU.         

BEHIND YOU, ASSHOLE.            

JEFF, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?        

      ( ambulance radio )       

        ALL RIGHT, MISS WALLACE,
        I THINK THAT'LL BE IT.  

    IF YOU WANT TO HEAD OVER    
    TO THE AMBULANCE THERE,     

YOU CAN RIDE WITH YOUR          
FRIEND TO THE HOSPITAL,         

                 AND WE'LL MEET 
                 YOU THERE.     

ALL RIGHT.                      

WAIT. DETECTIVE IRONSIDE,       
DID THEY EVER FIND RICK'S SON?  

            YES, MA'AM. WE FOUND
            MARK SAFE AND SOUND.

          HE'S DOWN AT          
          THE STATION RIGHT NOW.

NO, NOT MARK, BEN,              

THE ONE FROM                    
THE INSANE ASYLUM.              

THE ONE THAT RICK WAS           
TRYING TO FRAME THIS ON?        

           OH, UM, I'M NOT SURE.

           I...I DON'T THINK SO.
           WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK. 

THEN, HE'S STILL OUT THERE.
