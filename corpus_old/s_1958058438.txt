[disembodied voice] You're doomed! Doomed!

[moody music]

[thunder clap]

[thunder clap]

[music stops]

[music resumes]




Hmmm?

I wonder what he meant by "Arbor Day"?


I can tell you about Arbor Day.

It happened a long time ago.

In color.

It started out

just like any other day.

[heavy breathing]


Whew!

swell place to plant our tree, Daddy?

Sure Elm.

The woods are full of great places to plant trees.

Weâ€™ll look for the best one, and weâ€™ll plant that baby!

Gee, Arbor Day sure is neat, Dad!

[Dad Laughs]

Well as a botanist, I think itâ€™s pretty neat, too.

Honey, honey... would you like me to take over?

Oh no dear. Iâ€™m feeling as strong as an ox.



What is it, Elm?

have so much hair on her face?


[gasping for air]



Iâ€™m gonna be OK. Iâ€™m gonna be alright.



Ohhhh boy.





Iâ€™m gonna be OK. Iâ€™m gonna be alright.

you wonâ€™t fill your pockets so heavy

you didnâ€™t need your wallet

you didnâ€™t need your keys

and you donâ€™t need spare change in the forest!




Happy Arbor Day!


Wow, this must be our lucky day.

[pick sound]

This sucks.

[bird tweets]

I gotta work on fucking Arbor Day!

I hate this fucking job.

[bird squawk]

Bingo!


[bird tweet]

[bird squawk]

Bingo.

Ah shit.

[sizzle sound]

[demeanor change] Howdy folks!



Say that sure is a beauty!

You know when I was your age

me and my daddy planted a tree just like that one.

You know that treeâ€™s still standing there today.

Sometimes I go back and look at that tree...

Itâ€™s like a piece of my past.

How come youâ€™re not planting trees today?


Mr. Ranger has a very important job.

He has to make sure the forest the forest is safe

for all the campers.


we share this forest with our animal friends.

Respect the woods, and itâ€™ll respect you.


Bye bye now, and you folks have a happy Arbor Day.

Assholes.


That oughta do it.

You know Elm, I think we picked a perfect location.

Thereâ€™s rich topsoil, ample
sunlight & plenty of water.

All the ingredients necessary
for a plant to grow up healthy.

Wow! Our treeâ€™s gonna last a
hundred million, zillion years!

Ha ha ha.

Well Elm, I donâ€™t know if it will be here that long

But it should be here for years
for us to come and enjoy it.


Look Daddy, a man in a bear suit!

[Bear sighs]



Look Daddy, a GRIZZLY BEAR!

[Bear snarls]


Come here, lilâ€™ fella. Cmon...

Iâ€™ve got a nice fig newton for ya.

Good boy! [kissing noises]

Here ya go [kissing noises]

C'mon. [kissing noises] C'mon. Thatâ€™s good.

Please Daddy I'm scared!

Relax Elmer, itâ€™s only a little bear.

[kissing noises]

What do you think a bear is
doing in this part of the woods?

Heâ€™s probably just a little hungry.

[00:08 07.23]Hey you know, it is mating season

Heâ€™s probably hungry for a little love.


Honey, not in front of Elmer.

Please Daddy, please!

Ah Elm, this guyâ€™s been around humans so long

heâ€™s probably tame as a kitten.

Please daddy! Please, please!

Relax Elmer.

Your father wouldn't feed the bear if it wasnâ€™t safe.

Câ€™mon Elm, heâ€™s probably more
afraid of us then we are of him

You watch this...




ELMER! RUN!!!!!!!

[ferocious roar]


No!

[growls and heavy breathing]

Please!!!

[Bear growls] [Mom whimpers]

[tearing sound] [scream]

[roaring sound] [frightened moans]

[blood curdling scream]


As a youth he witnessed his
parents being mauled by a bear.

His father was decapitated.

And they found traces of bear semen

in his mother's mutilated body.

God! What a horrible story!

Poor child.

Yes, and to add to the tragedy

the event occurred on Arbor Day

[dramatic bells]

making the holiday unbearable.

Poor kid.

Imagine...

not being able to celebrate Arbor Day.


Oddly enough the only day
of the year that his brainwaves

show any change is on Arbor Day.

The rest of the year he remains in a catatonic trance.

What the HELL is that?!?

Itâ€™s the New York Mets, Doctor.

"Itâ€™s the NY Mets, Doctor." The NY Mets.

And tell me missy,

Who are the mets playing their next home game, hmm?

The Cubs.

Who?

The Cubs, Doctor.

"The Cubs, Doctor."

The Cubs, Doctor.


And I take it you intend to remind poor Elmer

of his early childhood trauma, hmm?

Why donâ€™t you just run up to him and say,

"Look out Elmer, thereâ€™s a bear behind you!"

[growling sounds]

[snorting & roaring]

Donâ€™t you realize the mere mention of the word bear

can prolong poor Elmerâ€™s recovery?

Now exercise your sensitivity

and change that channel!




danger level that is elevated

That's better.


So youâ€™re saying that the only
day that Elmer's brainwaves

show any change is on Arbor Day?

[savage roars]

Yes, yes I did say that.

Well, correct me if Iâ€™m wrong doctor but

isn't tomorrow Arbor Day?

[dramatic bells]

Why yes. Yes it is.

We better prepare some type of restraint

as a protective measure.

It pains me to have to have to chain up

such a poor human being like this.


all these freaks should be chained up

just like animals

'cause thatâ€™s all they are.

They ainâ€™t no human beings.

Mr. Briggs

I thought I told you to mop up all of C-Section.

Maybe you should attend to your job

or I'll attend to it for you.

When youâ€™re through with that

then you may return and clean Mr. Jacobâ€™s room.

Have it done by midnight.

Yes, sir.

Oh and Briggs

In the future Iâ€™ll thank you

to keep your uneducated comments to yourself.

You know, he hasn't been the same

since he had his neck slammed in that car door.

Well some just donâ€™t understand

that crazy people are people too

they just need someone to look out for them

and take care of them.

Itâ€™s two o'clock, doctor.

Ooh I'm late.

[eerie music]

[door opening] [keys jingling]

[door closing]


Hi Freaky.

Whatcha starin' at?

Huh?

Whatâ€™s the matter? Bear got your tongue?

I know all about you freaky

And I bought you a present

Yeah, a surprise.

Look here.


You like it?

Happy Ar-Bear Day Freaky

Awwww.

Looks like your Daddy wasn't the only one

who lost his head that day, huh, Freaky?

And I bet your momma loved when that bear...

[clock chimes]

[ropes tearing]

[threatening music]

[choking sounds]

Hey! I was only kidding!

I really didn't think your momma enjoyed it!

I swear!

Hey, I'm sorry. Iâ€™m sorry. I didn't mean it.

I swear! Iâ€™m sorry!

Hey, Elmer...

[choking sounds]

[music intensifies]


[squishes & screams]


[more squishes & groans]


This is really taking a lot out of me.

[squishes/screams]


Ewwwwww.


[squish, splat, screams etc.]

[splat, tear, squish, scream]


[last gasp]

[body crash]



[rock music] [Arbor Day Theme]

Every year when the leaves turn green

You wanna blow off school, you wanna let off steam.

Cause you hate your job and you hate your old man

they donâ€™t wanna ROCK! They donâ€™t understand

that itâ€™s ARBOR DAY

A time to grow

'Cause itâ€™s Arbor Day

A time to reap what you sow.

My fruit is ripe and my branches strong

And I'll plant anybody who does me wrong.

Now I got some beer and I got some weed

What better day to plant my seed

than on ARBOR DAY

A time to grow

'Cause itâ€™s Arbor Day

A time to reap what you sow.

[smoking guitar solo]

[whizzing down the frets]

[guitar melting finale]

Sometimes you gotta stand up

for the things that you believe

Stand as tall as trees

Kill the enemies like weeds!

So I prune a bush in my baby's park

and my stem is hard, I want to make her bark.

'Cause she cuts my roots and she sets me free

She taps my sap like a maple tree.

And itâ€™s ARBOR DAY

A time to grow.

'Cause its Arbor Day

A time to reap what you sow.

Arbor Day

[slow music fade]


how much longer 'til we reach this place?


Last time I was out here I was so high on angel weed

It seemed like it only took ten seconds.


because my feet are killing me and Iâ€™m starving.

Well hey Jen, I got some nuts...



Charlie youâ€™re such an asshole!


Canâ€™t you take ze joke?

[irritating laugh] Good one!

Hey Stacey, chuck on some tunes.



for a special bulletin.

A crazed lunatic has just
escaped from the South Oaks

insane asylum. Police warn
he is extremely dangerous

and was last seen heading towards


All they play is news and commercials these days.


Theyâ€™re so creepy and they don't talk to anybody.

Just leave them alone. Theyâ€™re ok, they're just shy.

Look, sis!

A perfect specimen of Salt-spray Rose!

Ooh thatâ€™s a beauty, Bobby.

And look at the symmetry of the veni-structure!

Now thatâ€™s a marvel of
vegetive nutritional transport.

We'll have to put this one in the scrap book.

C'mon you two, join the party!

Hey we gotta be close.

I remember bumping into this stump last time.

Eureka!

This way dudes!


the way you sniff out drugs
you should work at the airport.


Iâ€™m telling you, Detective

weâ€™ve got to find this boy and quick!

In his mental condition

there's no telling what he might do.

Yeah, I'm inclined to believe you, Doc

after what he did to the attendant.

What was his name? Briggs?


Figures I gotta spend my Arbor Day

tracking down some psycho.

Please hurry, Detective.

I'm afraid he might be in some danger.

Suicidal tendencies are quite
common around the holidays.

Well no offense, Doc

but Iâ€™m a little more worried

about the other 4 billion people out there.

Voila!

I told you I'd find this place.

This place is awful.

Yeah, itâ€™s kind of creepy.

I dunno, I kinda like it.

[bad accent] It makes me feel right at home.


Don't worry, Sunshine.

After a few lines of my mystical guru powder

this place will look like the Taj Mahal.

I donâ€™t know guys, this place doesnâ€™t look too safe

the floors could be rotten. We could all get hurt.

Are you kidding, sis?

This building is at least fifty years old.

It must have been built

according to the old building codes.

I bet it's still as solid as a rock.

What's this kid know anyway?

You can believe him

Heâ€™s a whiz at calculus, biology, physics...

Not to mention mechanical engineering

psychology and chemistry.

Chemistry?

The only thing I remember
about chemistry is that time

I brewed up some wicked mushroom dust

for the Ted Nugent concert.

C'mon, trust me.

Hey you kids! RUN! RUN!

It's not safe!

The place is evil!

You'll all perish!

You're doomed! DOOMED!

Yeah!

And a Happy Arbor Day to you too, pal!

Iâ€™m starting to have second
thoughts about this place.

C'mon Smiley Face. There's nothing to worry about.

Holy Shit!

Look at this!

Jacobs? Who's that?

Wasnâ€™t that the guy that invented

blackjack moon rocks?

No.

But I remember that name
from one of my history text books.

As I recall, it had something to do with Arbor Day.

Bingo, kid!

Twenty years ago, Elmer Jacobs watched

his parents being mutilated

by a grizzly bear.

Now, heâ€™s a basket case in the looney bin at South Oaks.

Every year on Arbor Day his power grows.

And one day he'll escape

and come back to the only place he knows.

This house.

And he'll come back

for revenge.

Heâ€™ll come back

TO KILL!!!

Charlie you IDIOT!

[Charlie laughs]

C'mon guys, let's go in the house

before that nut comes back.

[phone ring]

Hello.

Yeah hi Honey, itâ€™s me.

Listen, I'm afraid I'm gonna hafta work late tonight.

But Honey, itâ€™s Arbor Day.

I just put the turkey in the oven

and Juniorâ€™s been waiting to plant that tree all day.

I know Honey. Donâ€™t you think
Iâ€™d rather be out planting a tree

with my son than chasing after some whack job?

I'm sorry, dear.

Itâ€™s just that Arbor Day has
always been so special to us.

Yeah Iâ€™m sorry too, Honey.

But sometimes a manâ€™s job has gotta come before

his turkey dinner

Even turkey with stuffing and brown gravy

on a bed of corn niblets in butter

and mashed potatoes with pearl onions

and tender glazed green beans

smothered in Hollandaise sauce

and a hot peach cobbler

with a scoop of french
vanilla ice cream and cool whip.

I also maid some triscuits and cheese whiz.

Well, maybe just a little nibble.

[door opening]



they neeed 'ze new cleaning lady.



[door closing]



You can say that again.


This is disgusting.

This place is filthy

[click, click]

And the lights donâ€™t work.

Pitbull, why did you drag us out to this shack?

Donâ€™t worry, Jen.

In just a few minutes,

you'll be able to see by the light of my silvery bong.

Hey Pitbull, why don't you try one of these beauties?

Whoa! Mintoid, Dude!


Whoa!



Maybe I'll just go look for the circuit breaker.

Considering this house is over 40 years old

it would be safe to assume a fuse box

would be located in the basement.

Well thank you Thomas Alva Edision.

This kidâ€™s a regular Whine-stien.

Heâ€™s just trying to be helpful.

Yeah Charlie, lay off!

Alright, look kid

Iâ€™m sorry.

I'm not such a bad guy.

Letâ€™s shake.




Aye yai yai yai aye.


I guess I'll check the cellar.

[squish, splat]


[sad music]

No one understands poor Elmer

No one understands.

Beneath that whacko killer

Thereâ€™s a frightened,

gentle man.

Denying people the love they need

is a selfish thing to do.

If we're not sharing

and not caring

Perhaps we're killers too.

Behind every killer

Thereâ€™s a heck of a guy.

Heck of a guy

And behind every cloud

Thereâ€™s a bright blue sky.

After coldest winter

comes the warm thaw of spring

warm thaw of spring

So take that troubled bird

underneath your wing.

So to criticize poor Elmer

is unjust and unfair.

Besides your parents were not

killed by a grizzly bear.

So there.

[music fades]


It was horrible!

Her viscera was smeared all over the basement.

Stacey always had a lot of guts. [laughs]

Charlie, this is serious.

OK if you donâ€™t believe me

come downstairs and see for yourselves!



Come downstairs and see for yourselves.

[door opening]


Let Charlie P.I. investigate!


I'm not going down there.

Come on. I really wanna see that viscera thing.

Really.

[door opening]

[creaky steps]

Oh my GOD!

It's freezing down here. [laughs]

I swear!

She was just here a second ago!

Hey Pitbull

I think Bobby's been getting into some of your dope.

You better check your Shangri-La pills.

See if oneâ€™s missing!






But it came from over there.

[eerie music]

[footsteps on cement]

[door opening]



Afraid of a little kitty cat?



in my lifetime.




ze numbskull!


Stacey's probably outside somewhere.


And fuses! My lucky day!


Stacey's probably outside somewhere!




[eerie bells]

[door slam]


Oh her viscera was smeared all over the basement.

Boo hoo hoo! [laughs]



Yeah, I'm kinda parched myself.

[clears throat] [exaggerated]

Anyone want a brewski?


I got my own.




Thank you.





Holy smokes! What are those kids still doing there?

I warned them! The house... it's evil!

Evil is everywhere!

Upstairs, downstairs

there's even a little bit under the sink there.

What are they doing? Those kids, they never listen.

The only way they'll their lesson is

when that crazy killer comes.

Then they'll know. And don't come crying to me

when that happens cause I told you and you just

wouldn't listen.

Holy smokes, that one there is really crazy.

Whatâ€™s he got on his hat there?

Look at that one with his wild hair...

he must be a Rock & Roller.

I hate those kids!


Those kids with their rock & roll and their

blue suede shoes

they need a good Finnegan pin

that's what they need!



[choking sound]

[running water sound]




[eerie bells]


hallowed be thy father, uh.

Give us this day our daily bread

and uh, a little butter, too.

Amen.


Ahh, thank you, Honey. This stuff looks great.

You must have been in the kitchen all day.

Oh these peas look good.

Yeah, you know you can't work a case on an empty stomach.

Thank you, thank you.

Boy this chicken looks terrific!

[whish, chop]

Would you like the last piece?

I donâ€™t know if I should.

Ah, what the hell, it's Arbor Day.

[bad accent] Gee Rachel,

Your brother is ze loco! [laughs]

I donâ€™t know, this is so unlike him.

Something must have given him a pretty bad scare.

Well a little shot of my lightning lotus liquid

should calm him right down.

I donâ€™t know you guys, itâ€™s getting kind of dark out.

I wonder where Stacey is.

Yeah. And Scruffy's missing too.

Gee, Iâ€™m getting kind of worried.

Iâ€™m gonna go out and look for her.

[creaky door]

Scruffy?

Scruffy?

Scruff?

Scruffy?

[annoying laughs]

[splat, squirt]

[eerie musical dirge]

I donâ€™t know, Jen. Maybe there is something wrong.

I mean, first that weirdo

and now everybody is disappearing.

Whereâ€™s Pitbull?

Weâ€™re all alone in this deserted house.


Hello, Operator?

Can you get me the police?

Seventh precinct.

[threatening music] [footsteps]

[metal grind]

No, seventh precinct.

I'll wait.

Hello, seventh precinct?


[shears drop]


Yes, can I speak to Officer Bradley?

Hi snuggles.


[metal screech]

Of course.

Do you miss me?


Just me and Rachel.

All alone

in this dark old house

with nothing to do.

Say, what time do you get off?

You're already off?

Why donâ€™t you and Jimmy Hamilton

slip on by here?

[hatchet on brick]

[dirt kick]

[dirt kick]

You have a date?

What do you mean you have a date?!!!!


[click, click, click]

[dirt thrown]

What is some whore you busted
out in front of the coffee shop?

No you shut up!

You wish!

[tape tear]


[muffled motor]

Thatâ€™ll be the day!

I wouldnâ€™t call for your help

if there was a homicidal maniac trying to kill me!

I hate you!!

OOH I HATE YOU!!!

[wire tear]


I think Iâ€™ll go see what Bobbyâ€™s doing.

[door creak]

Bobby?

Bobby?

Bobby?

[eerie music]

Bobby?


[music builds]

Bobby?


[trap closing]


Help with this!

What are you doing, Bobby!

The way Stacey's organs were torn out

would indicate a creature of super human strength.

We'll need something to combat this aberration.

Stop talking that nonsense.

The only psycho here

is the one you've created in your subconscious.

Then please explain. Where is everybody?

I donâ€™t know, theyâ€™re around somewhere.

No they're not. Theyâ€™re dead! I know it!

Bobby, I promise you they're ok.

I'll go upstairs and find them right now.

Please donâ€™t go, sis!

Alright Bobby, relax. I wonâ€™t go anywhere.

Iâ€™m gonna find the bathroom.



[creaky stairs]

This place gives me the creeps.

[eerie music]

Who's idea was this anyway?

Looks safe enough.

Hello? Anybody home?

[door knob rattle]

A bathroom!


with a light that works!

And a mirror.

Itâ€™s still disgusting

like everything else in this house.

[drum hits]

[music builds]


You asshole!


You scared the shit out of me. Where the hell you been?

I was just out back whipping up some pleasure pills.

Care to join me?

Sure.

Maybe we can whip up some pleasure of our own.

Cool.



So uh,

why do they call you Pitbull?

Because I grab on

and never let go.

See Bobby, that must be them upstairs.

No problem, Detective.

Valuable acres of forest are lost every year

by manâ€™s careless handling of fire.

If people would just take the time to

make sure that their matches,
cigarettes or campfires are out

we could all avoid the needless destruction

of one of the planet's most valued natural resources

the forest!

So, whadda ya say

ya give me a hand?

Uhh,

Yeah, sure.

C'mon, the fire is spreading!



Must be my lucky day.

Oh, Detective.

You must be here to see Rachel.

Yeah, is she going to be ok, Doc?

Oh.

My cd's are about to mature.

Well does that mean she's gonna be alright?

Oh, well sheâ€™s a remarkable girl.

I'm sure someday she'll be able
to put this tragedy behind her.

Of course, Arbor Day will never be the same for her.

It will never be the same for me either, Doc.

Hey!

How about a quick nine?

Sounds good.

He meant all that with those two words?

No.

I just made it up.

[both laugh]

No man could mean so much

by two words.

Excuse me, sir?

I found more stuff in the vault.

Throw it on the fire with the rest.

Ok.

[Arbor Day Theme]


Every year when the leaves turn green

You wanna blow off school, you wanna let off steam.

'Cause you hate your job and you hate your old man

they donâ€™t wanna ROCK! They donâ€™t understand

that itâ€™s ARBOR DAY

A time to grow

'Cause itâ€™s Arbor Day

A time to reap what you sow.

My fruit is ripe and my branches strong

And I'll plant anybody who does me wrong.

Now I got some beer and I got some weed

What better day to plant my seed

than on ARBOR DAY

A time to grow

'Cause itâ€™s Arbor Day

A time to reap what you sow.

[smoking guitar solo

[whizzing down the frets]

[guitar melting finale]

Sometimes you gotta stand up

for the things that you believe

Stand as tall as trees

Kill the enemies like weeds!

So I prune a bush in my baby's park

and my stem is hard, I want to make her bark.

'Cause she cuts my roots and she sets me free

She taps my sap like a maple tree.

And itâ€™s ARBOR DAY

A time to grow.

'Cause its Arbor Day

A time to reap what you sow.

Arbor Day

[music fades]




[scary bells]

You're doomed! Doomed!
