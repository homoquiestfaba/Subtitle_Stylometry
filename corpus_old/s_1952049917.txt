Oh, my, yes.
You've got the go-ahead, Mr. Wong.

There's precious life

Ah!

No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one.

I'm not crazy.

It's a $49 value.

No, it won't.
Yeah, it will. Shut up!

We'll run off, but not till after I win

One entry, please.

Bender, no! You can't beat
the best players in the universe.

You're not lucky enough.
Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky.

The scrap metal I'm made from

Yo, you see this over here over there?

But, Skip, that was your lucky robot's

While it is true that I did wake up
with only one foot this morning,

there is no proof that my
beloved Fanny was involved.

Aside from the hacksaw
I found under her pillow.

Well, what about that Bender guy?
You want I should give him the clamps?

Not yet, Clamps. Only one thing
can prove that he has my lucky foot.

Torture with the clamps
or a clamp-like device?

No. We are gonna sit tight and see
if he wins the poker tournament.

He does, that proves
he's packing my lucky foot,

What's the matter, Fry,
you scared? Or just crazy?


All right, all in.

Yes! Four aces!

Read 'em and weep,
and then tell me what they are.

Two kings. And with three on the board,
that gives Bender five kings.

We'll meet back here in 50 years,
our bodies broken and our lives wasted.

And you say these are free shovels?


I'm back, baby.

Bender! I thought the
Robot Mafia killed you.

Nah, they just shot us and buried us
a few times as a warning.

Bender was so brave.

He never stopped making out with me
the whole time they were shooting us.

I sure didn't.

I gotta get back to my husband, baby.
Will I see you tonight?

Probably not.

It's a 14-footer with a clown hazard.
What club you recommend, Baggy?

As on every hole,
I suggest the putter.

Your golf club sure is classy,
Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy.

(CURSING IN MANDARIN)

It is very nice.

I just wish Amy and I didn't have to
wear these sexist badges on our melons.

We're lucky even to play as guests, Leela.

Dad's club has a very

Is that my ball?
I think that my ball.

Great putt, Dad.
Okay, we're done.

Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place
so green in the middle of the desert?

Doesn't that waste a lot of water?

Nah, we got plenty water,
pumped directly from flamingo lake.


They'll be fine.

LEO: Oh, yeah, I love miniature golf.
Love everything about it,

except how damn miniature it is.

That's why I'm building the universe's

Indeed so. This whole

Hey, yeah! We could do each
other's toenails and make shivs.

That's crazy.
We've done nothing wrong,

other than killing and
dismembering the vice-president.

We need to make a choice, sisters.

We can either keep pestering criminals
like Leo Wong with silly slogans...

Yeah.
Let's do that.

Actually, I meant that to be
the less preferable alternative.

We can either chant slogans
or we can take action.

What was the first choice again?

I choose to save the environment by
sabotaging Leo Wong's golf course.

Who's with me?

Could we still use our bullhorns?

Absolutely.

But then, for reasons unknown...

Ooh. "Reasons unknown."

grabs the attention of me, the viewer.

For reasons unknown...

Nice.

...the Chee began to recede,

this knowledge were called prophets,

some, fruitcakes. We, the Legion
of Madfellows, are their heirs.

Hey, I'm on TV.

Well, that's the show.
Neat. What's it got to do with me?


Pooperdoodle!
I mean, pardon the omission.

You see, after untold eternities,
we have sensed a resurgence in the Chee.

FRY: Hey, that's the violet dwarf star
that Leela wants to save.

Freaking nailed it, corndog.

We believe this star
heralds a new green age,

and it's your destiny to be
its shepherd and protector.

Me? Why?

'Cause you got, like,
no delta brainwave, man.

The Dark Ones can't
groove off your thoughts.

Silence, Hutch!
You shall learn more in time, Fry.

But for now,
let's just say we have enemies,

enemies who can read
minds, except yours.

Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela.

No! If you tell anyone,
then their thoughts could be read,

and our enemies would
know of our existence.

For the sake of those you love,
you must keep this secret.

Do you foot-swear?
Okay. I foot-swear.

Good. Now, to save the
coming of the green age,

you must stop this man.

I know him. Leo Wong.
I work with his daughter.

Good, that will cut about
15 minutes of explanation.

You must gain Wong's confidence,
infiltrate his organization

and prevent him from
destroying the violet dwarf.

Looking for a job, eh?
Yes, sir.

Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at
the bottom and infiltrate my way up.

Sorry, no openings right now.

<i>What I need is security guard to</i>
<i>keep nutcases out of my office.</i>

I'm good at keeping nutcases.
I said no way.

<i>Security guard gotta be tough.</i>

<i>This idiot don't look like</i>
<i>he could handle those feministas.</i>

I look like an idiot who
can handle those feministas.

<i>He'll have to do better than that.</i>

I'll have to do better than that.

Hmm. You and I think a lot alike.

You really think you can
stand up to those eco-freakos?

Sir, with me around,
they'll be the least of your worries.

Stand by, men. And manly aliens.
Prepare to test fire King Kong hole.

(THUNDEROUS BOOM)

It workses.

Good job, men. And manly aliens.

Construction of
King Kong hole complete.

Typical.
Always King Kong, never Queen Quong.

What are those, hooks?
Get out of heres, you hookers.

This is my turfs.

Helpses!


LEELA: You go, gorilla!

Our top story.
The string of eco-vandalism

that began with a harmless
vice-presidential killing

has spread across the galaxy.

Why do you always get to
read the top story, Morbo?

Because viewers trust a deep male
voice and huge, throbbing forehead veins.

(BEATING RHYTHMICALLY)

Not all reaction to the crime
spree has been negative.

We spoke with several people who viewed
these courageous eco-feminists as heroes.

I just wish there was
some way to... Excuse me.


Some way to show I support 'em.
Send them some smokes or something.

So you make more than
twice what I do. What?

This just in: Root 2 News has
received a video communique

from the eco-feminists'
unknown hideout.

This is sub-commander L.,

den mother of the
Feminista Revolutionary Collective,

with a message for Leo Wong.

Leo, you're a parasite on the universe,
and parasites must be destroyed.

That's why we've adopted
this parasite as our mascot.


I know it's a little confusing.

The point is, even this
vicious leech has a right to exist,

because it's a part of nature.

And that's why a vicious leech
like Leo Wong must be exterminated.


Again, confusing.

We call on women
everywhere to join our struggle

against eco-chauvinist Leo Wong.

We especially need
good communique writers.

Feministas unite!

In other news...
Feministas unite!

<i>Feministas unite!</i>

Incredible. Absolutely incredible.

You're telling me this TiVo machine
can pause and rewind live TV?

These crazy broads
gonna ruin me, Nixon.

You gotta help me.
Send the army or something.

Something big that shoots.

Sir, I don't care if you
are my biggest contributor.

Our armed forces do not serve
your private business interests.

Sorry, I...


I'm just yanking your chain, Leo.
I'm on it like boring on Gerry Ford.

(MILITARY MARCH PLAYING)

Zapp Brannigan purporting for duty.

For the love of God, Kif,

Report, Brannigan.

Mr. President, I failed to identify
these curvaceous banditas

despite hours of staring
at their dossiers.

Yet, I seemed to have
stroked myself upon good luck,

for a patriot of the highest order
has volunteered to lead us to them.

(PLAYING DRAMATIC FANFARE)

(PLAYING DRAMATIC FANFARE)

These eco-feminists
are ruthless criminals

who'll stop at nothing
to save the environment.

I don't see how
a bending unit can catch them.

Not just any bending unit,
<i>Presidente.</i>

I happen to be brilliant,
fearless and short on cash.


Slush him, Kroker.

Bender here has identified the femdito
commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela,

whom I once made love at.

And he's willing to fink
her out for a few simoleons?

It's not about the money, Nixon,
though I'd like much more.

It's 'cause Leela's a threat.
A threat to my reputation.

She's committed 30 felonies
in 12 star systems.

If no one stops her, she'll break
my record for longest rap sheet.

(RASPY HOWL)

That's a despicable motive,
Bender, and I respect it.

(THANKING IN SPANISH)

Now, I could find Leela, but
you'll need to authorize a wiretap.

As many as you like.
I only need one.

Let's call it six.

Question. If you don't know where
Leela is, how can you wiretap her?

I'm not wiretapping her,
Greensleeves.

You see, like all women,
Leela has one weakness.

BENDER: Hello, weakness!

Hey, Bender, check it out.
I'm Leo Wong's new security guard.

I got an ID badge and a flashlight,
and I ordered this mustache.

Neat. Say, speaking of
whatever the hell you just said,

I need to make a cell
phone telephone call.

Can borrow your
cell phone telephone?

Okay, but don't
restart my Tetris.

I was finally about
to get one of those pieces

that looks like a backwards "L."

Okay, superstud.

Looking good, security.
No feministas getting past you.

No, sir. Not on my
mustache's watch.

Fry, I can't believe you're working
with my dad against Leela.

How can you claim to be
her friend and still want her in jail?

(CLEARS THROAT)

It's a tightrope walk,
I won't deny it.

It takes the kind of multi-sided
thinking your dad's so brilliant at.

You mean being two-faced?
Don't mind cranky-pants here.

She been cranky ever since
she was a fat little girl.

Dad!

Can I be brutally honest, Fry?
I always wanted a son.

That hurt, but I can take it.

(SPEAKS MANDARIN)

I knew you wanted a son!

Why do you think I became
a miniature golf champion?

Why do you think I wear
these stupid boys' sweat suits?

big, fat butt, that's why.

Now, sir, in fairness,
Amy's butt is actually pretty hot.

What is it with you men?

Why does everything
revolve around my butt?

'Cause it's so big and massive.

Sorry.
That's it!

Why don't you just adopt Fry and
make him the son you never had?

That'll replace the daughter
you don't have anymore!

(GRUNTS IN ANGER)

Whoa! What's with Big Butt?

She just hungry.

Here you go, Fry.
Thanks.

Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in
the wrong place and ended the game.


Great! Now Amy's gonna
tell Leela I'm a jerk.

If only I could explain
I'm on a secret mission against evil.

Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil.


What's going on in there?
A scary noise?

Hey, you're one of
Leela's feministas.

"Save the environment!
Wo-mandate Leo's retirement!"

That's terrible writing!
Stop making your point so ineffectively!

Take your mands off of me!


I'm on your side.


Please, can you take
a message to Leela?

What is it?

Just say her sweet goofbag is working to
save the violet dwarf star, just like she is.

Very well,
I'll fem-municate your man-formation.

Just tell her.


Well, this is it, old friends.
Planet Express is done for,

what with our
delivery crew missing

and the abysmal sales
of Tickle Me Bender.


<i>Quit touching my junk, pervert!</i>


Hold out your hands

When will it end?

I suppose.

Should we shout a clever slogan?

You mean something like,
"The best defense is a good fence?"

Yeah, something

I wish we could,

but our chief slogan writer is
back at the Honeybun Hideout.

Does "violet dwarf" rhyme
with "men are dorks"?

It does through a megaphone.

Is somebody here?

If you're the DSL guy,

Who gave you that message for Leela?

I don't know his name.

Then you are of no use to the Dark Ones!


Long lost brother, avenge my death.

<i>Eat only natural whole-grain bread.</i>


<i>Six, seven, eight</i>
<i>Lock the gate</i>

My dirty, shifty friend?
Hey, Fry, long time.


Welcome back to the
Legion of Madfellows, man.

Why'd you bonk me, you idiot?

You could have just
asked me to come with you.

And where are we? This doesn't
look like your regular dumpster.

All in good time!

I guess now is a good time.

We are on Mars,
in a forgotten cavern

abandoned by the native
Martians a million years ago.

FRY: Actually, it was five years ago.
I remember 'cause they washed my socks.

You have done well, Fry.

You have ingratiated
yourself with Leo Wong.

Yup, I kissed his ass
from cheek to shining cheek.

So, what do I do next?

As Wong security chief,

you will be on hand when
he attempts to destroy the violet dwarf.

You must not let that happen.

"Must let happen."

Not happen!

"Must let occur."

Let me tell you a story.
A story of two alien species

so ancient that compared to them
the human race is a mere college senior!

On a distant planetoid they evolved
to cooperate in their quest to survive.

Cooperation, because
life is a team sport.

GRAND CURATOR: But, over time,
one species evolved a better strategy,

and an evolutionary arms race began.

That concludes the audio-visual
portion of our head-clonk and lecture.

Wait, what happened
to the snakes and the frogs?

I need to know!


The frogs, or possibly the snakes,
evolved into vicious killing machines,

honed by the merciless forces of
natural selection and intelligent design.

We call these the Dark Ones!


These evil creatures preyed on all life,
driving species after species to extinction.

Meanwhile, however,

the second species evolved
to fend off the Dark Ones,

befriending and protecting
all other living things.

Even Celine Dion?
Probably.

We call these noble
beings the Encyclopods,

because their DNA incorporates

the DNA of every endangered
species they encountered,

so they can recreate
them if they go extinct.

Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe
can be used to recreate my old girlfriend!

Bingo.

<i>ANNOUNCER.:</i>
<i>Meanwhile, at the Honeybun Hideout.</i>

There! Now you know how it feels
to be locked up in a go-go cage.

What the hell are you talking about?

Shut your man-hole.

<i>(DANCE MUSIC PLA YING)</i>


I feel dirty.

Are you sure Fry is
working for your father?

It just doesn't seem like him to
be so evil, or to hold down a job.

It's true, Leela.
Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess.

But the Fry I know
wouldn't do that.

I'm gonna call his cell phone
telephone and prove you wrong.

Oh, no! Frida's been murdered!

(ALL GASPING)

Sweet she-cattle of Seattle.

HERMES: Not your
strong suit, woman.

Who could have done this?

Your dad? Nixon?

Fry?

No, never. I don't think.

Anyhow, there's a crazed
murderer on the loose,

possibly in the shadows
or hanging from the ceiling.

(ALL SCREAM)

So just stay calm while I call Fry.

(BONES CRACKLE)

So where are the Encyclopods
and the Dark Ones now?

When the life-giving
Chee receded,

only the toughest organisms
could adapt and survive,

like the Dark Ones.


Many more died out,
like the Encyclopods.

But, and this is the
great secret of our age,

we believe they
left an egg behind.

Is it edible?
We're not gonna eat it!

Not unless we find a second one.
No, Fry, we intend to hatch it!

And that's where you come in.

And here I am.

At long last the tide
of Chee has returned,

and its nourishing flow
has awakened the dormant egg.

That's good.

It's better than good. It's better.
With its massive stash of DNA,

the Encyclopod can reconstruct
every species that ever went extinct.

Imagine, all the animals that
failed evolution's test, alive again!

The dodo bird, the brittle-klutz,
the striped biologist-taunter.

So, where is this egg?
In the violet dwarf star system.

And what does it look like?
A violet dwarf star!

You mean, the whole star
is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi.

Alas! Even now, a Dark One is headed
to the star to ensure its destruction.

Dang! So what does
this Dark One look like?


We don't know. I admit
it's a horrifically grave situation.

Don't sugarcoat it, Nine.

The Dark Ones have
been evolving so long,

it could be anything or anyone.

Or anybody.

You mean, like, people?

Any people. It will kill the egg,

and every dude, woman
and child who knows about it.

Even our crazy caps will
be useless at close range.

That's why only you, with your
defective unreadable brainwave,

may be able to thwart them

and usher in a new
green age of wonder and...

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

You're on Fry-time. Leela!

Did you get my message?
What message?

<i>Didn't you see Frida Waterfall?</i>

kill Frida Waterfall?

What? No. I told her
to tell you that I'm...

Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones
got her. It's all true.

We need to talk, Leela.
Then I can explain...

Well, I can't explain anything,
but we should talk anyway.

Where are you?
Oh, no.

I'm not gonna expose

in the giant miniature golf course.

But the course isn't finished.
And there's no girls allowed.

Two can play at that game.

Or even four, depending on
the number of ball colors available.

As well as our XM Radio antenna.

Then this chase is over.

We'll simply disappear and reappear in

another part of the universe.

but you have to give me
something to go on or I...

(EVIL LAUGHTER)

Hello? Madfellows? I need to...

Hello? Madfellows? I need to...


Okay, Leo Wong's about to
destroy the violet dwarf.

So, whatever I need to know
to stop him, tell me now.

Alas! Stopping Wong
isn't the only problem.

One of the Dark Ones will try to
stop you from stopping him.

So, you must stop it from
stopping you from stopping him.

But how can I stop
it stop me stop him?

Stop it! Behold,
the Omega Device.


FRY: That's it?

The name "Omega Device" sort of
conjured up something cooler-looking.

Not that I'm disappointed or anything.

The important thing is what's inside.

What does that look like?
No one knows, man.

It was invented
by a blind inventor,

and the one dude he
described it to was deaf.

So the legend goes.

When activated, the device will emit
a localized blast of delta-band noise

to momentarily
disable the Dark One.

Like farting in a tent?
No, an elevator.

Which is why you must
strike the enemy at point blank range!

(ALL AGREEING)

But the Dark One could
look like anything or anyone, right?

Or anywhere.

So, what's your plan to recognize it?

We don't have one.
Got it.

And we don't dare
think of one neither.

'Cause if we do, the Dark Ones
might sense kind of the general vibe.

Even through our mighty foil.

Oh, man!
Anyone got some tape or some gum?

As my colleague indicated,
the plan cannot come from us, Fry.

We were counting on you

and your unreadable brain
to come up with something.

That was a mistake.
I see that now.

Freaky thing is, the Dark Ones'
thoughts are unreadable, just like yours.

Yes, if we dared unwrap our heads,

we could easily locate the one other being
whose mind we can't read. The Dark One!

But then the Dark One
would read our minds

and crush them
like blood pumpkins.

Wait. I can read minds
and my mind can't be read.

I have a plan.
Great.

Whatever it is, don't tell us.

Wait. Fry can read minds
and his mind can't be read.

So he can safely
scan for the Dark One...

Shut up! Shut up!

including gang leader, Turanga Leela.
AKA, the Notorious B-l-ltch.

We finished un-pinking
the ship, Hubert. Now what?

Now we get back to work.

And if that means destroying
an ecosystem or two, so be it.

I just meant without our good
friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robot.

Oh, boo-hoo. This is a business,
not a social club. Money talks.

<i>True wealth is</i>
<i>measured in friendships.</i>

Shut up, you.

Life goes on.

But I believe we'll forever
carry the pain on the inside.


Oh, no, a rooster!
That indicates it's the following morning.

How's that creepy crawler doing?

I'm sorry, femi-sisters,
but it pooped out around 3:00 a.m.

Poor thing couldn't take another bite.


Well, I guess we failed.

But what matters is, we tried our
best and we looked good doing it.

(DEEP THUD)

(ALL GASPING)

Bender, is that you?

Who does it look like?
My identical cousin Buster?

Yes.

You're here to break us out?
But you're the one who put us in.

But I'm Bender,
king of the combination shot.

I put you in so that by busting you out,
I could commit 15 felonies at once.

Put my rap sheet miles ahead
of yours on the all-time chart.

You are one devious bastard.

That's what it says on my vanity plate.

What about the sentries?
Already taken care of.

I sent them a cake laced with nutmeg.
That's a human sleeping drug, right?

No, it's a human baking drug.


Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows
men have one fatal weakness,

they can't resist hookers.
Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do.



Your eyes say no,
but your machine gun fire says...


Ladies and gentleman
and whatever,

welcome to my most environmentally
disastrous implosion ever.

A whole star system!


Kif, old boy, mind if I sit on
your shoulders for a better view?

Well, actually, sir, I was hoping...

Thanks.

(KIF GROANS)

My associate Philip Fry here will have
honor to blow this ugly, dirty star

into nice, clean black hole.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

Fry, careful those wires.
What you doing down there?

Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W.

That nice. Get between
the toes there, very dirty.

(SIREN WAILING)

(GUNS FIRING)

Well, so much for Plan B.

What's Plan C?

All situations have the same Plan C.
Bending, come on.


(WOMEN SCREAMING)


We're boned, Bender.
It's a brick wall.

Granted, it's not on
the list of approved bendables,

but I'm so great!

(DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE)

Dogs! The boning continues.

Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous.
We are go for cheesing it.



(GUNS FIRING)

Professor! Hermes! Zoidberg!

Scruffy. A janitor.

You helped us escape?

Even after we locked you in a go-go
cage like common go-go dancers?

I couldn't live with myself, Leela.
I call myself a scientist,

wear the white coat and probe
a monkey every now and again,

yet I put monetary gain
ahead of preserving nature.

Can you ever forgive me?

I reckon.

I could kiss you, Professor.
Okay, but watch out for my new grill.


Before the grand finale, as it were,

it seems only fitting that I,
Commodore 64 Zapp Brannigan,

say a few brief pages in honor of...

<i>GRAND CURA TOR.: Whatever your plan is,</i>
<i>Fry, I suggest you get on with it.</i>

<i>Get... Shoot, I got hot</i>
<i>sauce on my Number 9 shirt.</i>

<i>FRY.: Okay, locate the Dark One by finding</i>
<i>someone whose thoughts I can't read.</i>

And unaccustomed...

<i>ZAPP.: By God!</i>
<i>I'm the greatest speaker of all time.</i>

<i>They're suckling at the</i>
<i>teats of my every syllable.</i>

Allow me now...

<i>KIF.: His voice is like ear sandpaper.</i>
<i>I miss Amy.</i>

<i>NIX ON.: The one secret</i>
<i>no one ever suspected</i>

<i>is that I really did</i>
<i>stage the moon landing.</i>

<i>On Venus.</i>

<i>(LAUGHING)</i>

<i>(SIGHING) If I had all the money</i>
<i>in the world, I'd... Oh, wait. I do.</i>

<i>(EVIL CACKLING)</i>

<i>I'd like to thank the academy,</i>
<i>my agent, and most of all,</i>

<i>my operating system,</i>
<i>Windows Vista, for everything it...</i>

<i>System error.</i>

<i>Naked ladies. Naked ladies.</i>
<i>Naked ladies. Naked ladies.</i>

<i>I never should have taken that accent</i>
<i>elimination class from Jackie Chan.</i>

And so, as we obliterize this star,

let us remember those immortal words
once spoken by a great man, <i>moi.</i>

And I quote, "All good
things must come to an end,

"preferably in
a humongous explosion."

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

Let's pop this beach ball.

ALL: Ten! Nine!

Eight!

(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

<i>There's no one here whose</i>
<i>thoughts can't be read.</i>

<i>No one, except me!</i>

<i>My thoughts can't be read.</i>
<i>But that's crazy.</i>

<i>If I were the Dark One,</i>
<i>I'd know it, wouldn't I?</i>

<i>But, here I am, right where</i>
<i>the Dark One would be,</i>

<i>about to blow up the star.</i>

<i>Oh, God! Somewhere deep</i>
<i>inside of me, it's me!</i>

<i>I'm the Dark One!</i>


(ALL GASP)

<i>Put your hands in the air!</i>

Should we wave them
like we just don't care?

<i>That's optional.</i>

You girl punks gone too far this time.
Your parents should be ashamed.

Yes, you should!


Amy?
Amy!

<i>VOICE.: Destroy the star, Leo, hurry.</i>

You got it, Mr. Voice-in-my-head.


(BOTH GRUNTING)

I've gotta admit, Amy,
you got a pretty good swing.

Really? Thanks, Dad.


Okay, time to defuse
this star cracker once and for all.

Leela, wait.
You're making a mistake.

You have no idea
what's really going on.

What is really going on?

I can't tell you.

Then why should I trust you? Why?

Because... Because...

You're you. That's all I need to know.

No! Don't do it!
Fiddlesticks.

Leela, are you crazy?

We became fugitives
and jail-breakers to stop him.

And hookers, don't forget hookers.

Shame on all of you.

After everything we've been through
together, do you really think Fry would...

(ALL GASPING)

Goodbye, Leela.
I destroy myself to save you.


Where's the boom?
I was expecting a boom.

It didn't work. I'm the Dark One,
and it didn't do anything.

You're not the Dark One, I am.

Leela?

Not Leela, you moron. Me!


What did you do to me?

(ALL GASP)

Ew!

I am the Dark One.
The very last Dark One.

How is it possible
I couldn't read your mind?

Oh, I am momentarily disabled.

(THUNDER CRASHES)

(ALL GASP)


Somethings wondersful.

LEELA: The star and the asteroid.
They were an egg and a sperm.

Great modem of mercy.
Cover the children's eyes.

There are no children here.

Then move your fat head.
I can't see.

(ALL EX CLAIM)

The Encyclopod is reborn.
A new green age has begun!

So the legend foretold.

Look! Inside its pouch.
Extinct Tasmanian tigers.

AMY: And dodo birds.
LEELA: And white rhinos.

HERMES: And striped biologist-taunters.

What are you gonna do, shoot us?

Life!


These once extinct plants
and animals are my gift to the universe.

Through untold generations,
my race has treasured their DNA.

Treat them wisely with the knowledge
that all species are precious.

This is unbelievable. What's going on?

To answer that, I must tell you a story.

A story of two alien
species so ancient that...

(LEECH SNARLS)

(ALL SCREAMING)


Hutch, are you okay?
My sister's femi-necklace.

What?


Hey, how come I can't
read your thoughts anymore?


I shall avenge you, Hutch Waterfall.


After all these eons,
the Dark Ones are no more.

Will you preserve their
DNA, O Great Encyclopod?

I suppose I should.
Wait, where did it go?


What?

Well, at any rate, I shall
preserve the DNA of <i>Homo sapiens.</i>

I thought you only saved the
DNA of endangered species.

Farewell.

I guess he didn't hear me.

Well, looks like that wraps everything
up in a nice big, old, fat sack of...

I hereby arrest you
fugitives on 53 counts of fugivity.

Kif, round them up,
and spare me the weary sigh for once.

Kif.

KIF: Wait for me.

Well, this is the end. There was so
many things I wanted to say to you.

Like what?

Like this is not the end.
But mostly just, I love you, Leela.

(LOUD BANG)

Maybe I waited too long to say this,
but I love you, too. Wormhole!

Sweet topology of
cosmology, it's huge!

If we fly into it, it could take
us trillions of light years away.

There's no knowing if we'll ever return.

What do we do?
Should we go for it?

Into the breach, meatbags.
Or not. Whatever.

ALL: Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.
