Fidencio!

Shut all the doors!

I'll be with this woman.

Hail Mary.
Conceived without sin.

How long since your last
confession, daughter?

Father Salvador, it's Esperanza,
the mother of the girl who died.

Except she's not dead, Father.

What?

SaintJude told me.
My saint of desperate causes.

IThappened righTafter The funeral.

Look Dominga, how come I'm always
the one who ends up fixing dinner?

Esperanza.

Whoever told you your daughter died
of this unknown disease, lied to you.

Thank God I'd run out
of Easy-Off, Father.

If I hadn't, where the hell
could my saint have appeared?

That oven is so grimy, it's embarrassing.

What should I do, Father?
Clean it or leave it as it is?

For now let's keep
this miracle a secret.

Leave the oven as it is.

This kind of filth is not a sin.

Do you have a filthy sin to confess?

Not really.

Except cursing at my friend Soledad.
But it's not fair, Father!

I work all day in the hardware store
and come home to a pile of ironing,

and she's camped
in front of her soap opera.

Well, when you're hooked on a soap,
you're hooked.

Like me with Tania's Promise.
Do you watch it?

No, Father. I don't watch soaps.

All right, then.Just try
to understand your friend Soledad.

And say five rosaries,just in case.

And not a word about our miracle...

to anyone!

In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

Amen.

Hey, Father, can I tell Soledad?

No!
-Just her, I promise.

Not even her.

Father, don't be such a--
What?

How can I keep it from her?

You know we've lived together
since our husbands died.

We're like sisters.
We raised Blanca together.

You need a lot of faith to believe
in miracles, and not everybody has it.

By the type of apparition, it's clear
your saint wants only you to see him.

Otherwise he'd appear
before everybody...

on the side of the bridge,
like SaintJohn did five years ago.

Where were you?
You scared me!

The Espinozas came to give you their
condolences. I didn't know what to say.

I went to see Father Salvador.

So much grief.

What are we going to do with it?

We've been crying for no reason.

What?

Blanca is not dead.

What are you saying?

SaintJude told me. In person.

For God's sake, Esperanza.

You're all I have left.
Yes.

Don't go crazy on me, please!

SaintJude, you know I'm not crazy.

I just want my Blanca back.

I wore This slip
aTmy fifteenTh birthday, darling.

I'd stitch it a bit shorter.

Really?
Uh-huh.

Don't tell me you filled this out, Mom.

One always finds a way.

You'll see...

when you're fifteen you'll fill it out.

I'm sure God will give you
the breasts of an angel.

It's really shaping up.
It is.

I'm going to try the mantilla on you.

SainTJude,
you've always been aTmy side.

Tell me where my daughter is.

If all this is a lie,

Then she wasn'Tin The hospiTal
when I wenT To pick her up.

Good afternoon.

Afternoon. What's up?

I came to pick up my daughter.
Is this where you pay?

What's the patient's name?

Blanca Diaz. I'm her mother.

Hi.

Blanca Diaz.

Blanca Diaz.

She had her tonsils out.

Mrs. Diaz, haven't you been notified?

No. What happened?

You'd better go find Dr. Ortiz.

Doctor! Excuse me.

I'm so glad I found you, Doctor.
How is Blanca?

We don't know what happened...

but your daughter passed away.

Blanca.

Easy.

I got the news when I came in.

They have her in the morgue.

Can I see her?

I'm afraid not, Esperanza.

She died of a virus we're not
familiar with. We can't let it spread.

She has to be buried immediately.

Sign here, please. Here.

And your initials here.

Thanks.

Let them out.

But I have to see her, please!

''Do not open. Danger of contagion.''

Esperanza.

I'm very sorry.
Idiot!

Oh, dear!

SainTJude, are you lisTening?

You know I'll do
whatever you ask me to.

Are you listening?

Sorry I'm late, Father. It was my turn
to close the hardware store.

Hello, Fidencio.
How have you been, my child?

If I tell you SaintJude has reappeared,
can you keep it quiet?

Fidencio, leave us alone.

This time he appeared when I was
baking stuffed chicken breasts.

Esperanza, you must find your daughter.

Yes, SaintJude, but how?

Search for her.
Whatever it takes, find her.

Search for her!

I'm positive she's not there.

Impossible.

But Sir, it's my daughter!

I'm sorry, but I can't authorize
an exhumation,

even if God Almighty
orders it himself.

It was SaintJude.
Don't get confused! It's not the same.

All I ask is that you
open the casket...

to see if the body is there or not.
That's all.

Without orders
from the Forensic Service...

I can't exhume a little finger.

And don't lean on my desk,
can't you see the glass is broken!

I'll walk you to the door.
There's more people waiting.

If it was your daughter, you'd be
digging her grave with your fingernails!

What's wrong with you?

What do you want? A bribe?
Want to take your little bite?

Police!

I should have you arrested!
Crazy bitch!

Why do I need a permit,
with an order from above?

For God's sake, daughTer.!

I'm only following the orders
from my little saint.

What do you think, Father?

I think...

there's nothing more
to be done in a legal manner.

Just what I thought.

So I went to the doctor
for a forensic order.

Good morning.

Good morning, Mrs. Diaz.

I'm looking for Dr. Ortiz.

I'm afraid he doesn't work here anymore.

Dr. Ortiz? Are you sure?

Look...

they say he got sick
and they took him away.

Can some other doctor help you?

When did this happen?
Which day, precisely?

Father, can you believe he disappeared
the day after my girl died?

How do you explain that?

I don't know, a coincidence maybe...

or perhaps he caught the virus, or--

Or he took her! That's it!
The doctor kidnapped her!

SaintJude is right!
That's why he's a saint!

Careful, my child...

you have to know
how to read his messages.

It's very easy to misinterpret.

If you think the doctor kidnapped her,

be very careful in your search.

Every day I read stories like this
in the tabloids.

Oh, Father...

you mean the doctor
could have sold her into--

Don't even say it!
Don't even say it!

Think about what you can do.

Then tell me when I get back.

I need to excuse myself for a moment.

Are you going to the bathroom?

Yes, my child.

Holy Soul,
I believe the words of SaintJude...

but who did I bury?

Saint Anthony,
most miraculous of all...

who can find a grain of sugar
in the desert...

help me find my Blanca.

Father, what a scare you gave me!

Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt
your prayer, but it's time to close up.

Yes, yes. I'm sorry to take up
so much of your time.

It's all right,
my soap doesn't start until eight.

But just in case,

say five rosaries before daybreak.

Yes, Father.

And stay out of trouble.

Remember that I'm here.
I promise, Father.

Lord, I just don't know
what to do with Esperanza.

She tells me what she's done,
but not what she's about to do.

If nobody can stop her,
you've got to watch over her, I beg you.

Go away!

Get out of here!

Beat it! You stinking, wet dogs!

Please, Saint Isidro, don't make it
harder on me! Take the rain away!

You won't find any bones here!

Who's out there!

See, I told you. A grave robber.

Fuck off, dogs, let us work!
You get up here!

Leave me alone, you idiots!

It's my daughter in here!

This ground is mine!
My property!

I paid in perpetuity!

Here are your Tools back, Don Arlindo.

I needed a hand last night--
I don't know what's gotten into you!

I'm sorry, please don't get mad.
It makes you look ugly.

I've told you zillions of times
not to open the store at night!

And coming to work in this state!
You're a disgrace!

I don't know what's going on
with you, Esperanza...

and I hate to say this
after your tragedy...

but you can't work here anymore.

You haven't even finished the tax forms!

You're making a fool of yourself!.

Thank God!
I've been looking for you everywhere!

Soledad--
Don't even talk to me!

This is the last straw!

You're even in the newspaper!
What's the matter with you?

I'm only following orders from my saint.

Esperanza, sit down.

Look, I know we're devastated
by what happened to Blanca...

and sometimes we imagine things.

But isn't your saint
too busy with his miracles...

to worry about us?

You spent the night out of the house!

You've never done this before.

I went to help Father Salvador
with his herb garden.

I'd rather you not say anything
than tell me lies.

Just look at yourself,
walking around like this in public!

For the sake of your dignity,
you can't do this to yourself!.

Mama.

Mama.

You and I will always be TogeTher.

Saint Michael Archangel...

Divine Protector,
you must know that...

Blanca is in danger
and needs your help.

I've always prayed to you
for the victims of the drug lords...

but now I pray for my own daughter.

With all my strength.

Father, you always startle me!

Do you want to confess?
Yes.

Fidencio!

Go tell Dona Carmelita...

not to make my cocoa yet.
It'll get scummy.

Be with you in a second, folks.

Get started with your penance:
pray one rosary to begin with.

I haven't even seen you in Mass.

Father, it happened again!

My saint appeared for a third time...

to tell me my Blanca
was in a Pink House.

You know what he meant by that...

don't you?
Of course!

They must have her
in one of those dirty places...

one of those brothels that smell of sin,

pleasing men who come and go.

Men wiTh huge bellies
and lice in Their body hair.

Bricklayers wiTh repTile hands
ThaTdraw blood wiTh each caress.

Married bureaucraTs
cheaTing on Their innocenT wives.

Go ahead, my child.

Father.

Is it true they steal little girls
to sell to brothels?

Unfortunately, these types
never make it to my confessional box.

But they do exist?
Yes, my child.

They have her living in hell!

What should I do?

You can only search for the truth.

Come what may.

That's exactly what I thought...

so I got a job at 'La Curva'.

Have you ever been there, Father?
Esperanza!

It's that little blue hotel
with the red door, by the hairpin turn.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

I changed The sheeTs and washed
The baThrooms on The second floor.

I had To waiTfor couples To come ouT.

SomeTimes I cleaned one room
eighT Times in a day.!

I Told Soledad
I was working in a hoTel.

IT was half True, buTI didn'T
wanTher To worry abouTme.

Catch me!

I've changed sheeTs sTained wiTh blood,

booze, urine.

Covers were so ripped
I had to throw them away.

But not a trace of Blanca.

I'd smell the sheets,
but never the scent of Blanca.

For God's sake, daughter!

I want to confess on her behalf.

Forgive her. She must not be able
to come close to a church.

You know that I can't absolve
through third party confessions.

Don't be a pain, Father.
What have you got to lose?

I'll give her a temporary absolution...

until she can come in person.

So, do you know where she could be?

More or less.

I finally got a clue...

in 'La Curva;

Sure, they've got them young.

Really hot, too.

I don't believe you.

Thirteen, fourteen years old.

But you have to ask in advance.

They don't let just anybody have them.

How much?

Neither of us could afford it.
They come from all over.

Oaxaca, Veracruz...

Young girls.

How about from the north?
From the north too.

They have to be virgins though.

They are precious.

A marvel.

Excuse me, where is the place
you're talking about?

Hey, it's a secret.

But if you want
I'll whisper it in your ear.

What? Afraid to do this in public?

No.
Come with me upstairs.

I'm not what you think I am.

Then what are you doing in this joint?
You come here to pray?

The truth is...

Catch me!

So, we didn't come here to pray?

Give me that!

Let's see, let's see.
What happened?

Come on out of there. Come on.

You're making me late. I have to go.

And the secret?
What secret?

The place you were talking about
downstairs. Is it the Pink House?

That's up in Tijuana.
Only gringos go there.

They happily pay big bucks...

to bang teenyboppers.

All the way to Tijuana?
How can I get up there?

Listen, why don't you stay here?

At least we like them
all grown up in this place.

Here, take it. It's on the house.

Besides, you're out of practice, honey.

Jumping on customers like that.

May the Archangel Raphael
safeguard our journey...

in mind, body and spirit.

May the Archangel Raphael
guide us through all danger.

That kid is not a kid. He's a midget.

What's your name?

Paloma.

Travelling alone?
Uh-huh.

Where do you live?

In Monterrey, in Guadalajara,
in Mexico City, in Acapulco.

You?

In Tlacotalpan, Veracruz.

What are you going to do in Tijuana?

What everyone goes there to do.

And you?

Me too. Me too.

It's a long fuckin' haul, huh?

Yeah.

Listen, could I lie down here?

Sure, of course.

I'll be your pillow.

Can you hold this too?
Sure.

I'll take one of these, and a statue
of the Holy Child of Atocha.

How about a Juan Soldado?
He's the best.

Beautiful! I'll take one.

Oh, my God!

Grab him! Slimebag!

I fucked up! I could have
grabbed your suitcase too!

Don't worry.
This is the important one.

All right, kid.
See you around.

Are you sure you'll be okay?

I could ask the same about you.

Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
All right.

Boy, that fuckin' guy. Asshole.

I'm stuffed!

Excuse me.

Do you know
where I can find the Pink House?

They told me it's here, in Tijuana.

The Pink House?
Are you sure you got the name right?

Positive.

No. I don't think so.

Could you bring me the bill, please?

Look at you!
Who could have guessed!

Oh, my God!

Hey, it's my treat.
And I'm outta here!

Shit!

Oh, Holy Child of Atocha, forgive her.

Blanca could be in the same situation.

Ask for Cacomixtle.

Cacomixtle? As in ''weasel''?

Cacomixtle!

Good evening.
Good evening.

Someone told me I could get directions
to the Pink House here. Do you know?

Are you going to look for work there?

Yes, work.

Do you have any references?
They don't let just anybody in.

References? Yes, I have eight years
experience, with tall ones, shrimps...

white guys, black guys, Chinese--

That so? Maybe I can help you.

I've got a client who might know.

Really?
He should come by tonight.

Really? All right,
I'll come back tomorrow.

You got a place to stay?

I'm going to look for a hotel.

And what's this?

Jose Luis, please understand me.

Is the client here yet?

No, but I brought you a little present.

If you're a whore,
I must be Michael the Archangel.

What makes you think I'm not... that?
What's you angle?

What are you after?
Let me guess...

you need dough to cross the border and
you think you can make it hooking, huh?

Easy, right?
No, that's not it.

Women like you ruin
the reputation of the trade.

Reputation?

Reputation. And well earned.

Face a guy ready to pop his rocks...

and you'll run like hell.

Hooking is like killing:

sounds easy,
but not everybody's got the nerve.

May I?

So you're into costumes, sweetheart?
All right, then.

I meant what I said about killing.

But only the first time is tough.

Then it becomes a habit.

Like this, like this.

That's it!

In this profession there are
basic rules you've got to learn.

And the first one, baby,
is called intimacy.

I think the client's
not coming tonight after all.

Where should I leave them?

They're for washing.

Come here.

Come here!

The madame is called Trini.

Don't mention my name.

Say that Mr. Scott Haynes sent you.

Mister who?

Scott Haynes.

Thank you.

No problem.

Nothing like recommending
an experienced whore.

You're fucked.

Jealous?

The devil doesn't fall in love,
asshole!

Yes?

Good morning, sir.
I'm looking for Dona Trini.

Who's calling?

Mr. Scott Haynes sent me here.

The San Diego judge?

Yes. He says that maybe
I could work here.

Come in.

What a weirdo.

This isn't a whorehouse or a love hotel.

It's a service institution.

We only cater to important gentlemen,
like Mr. Haynes.

Our clientele is very demanding.

Are you tested for AI DS?

No, but--

I'll send you to Dr. Oseguera.
He examines all my girls.

Does this mean I'm hired?
You're on a trial basis.

Saint Theresa ofJesus!

Thank you.

Esperanza will stay in Yuriria's room.

That girl's not coming back!

Thank you.

You may only enter your own room
and the public areas of the house.

You understand
that this is my guest lounge.

Oh, one last thing.
Hide your little box somewhere.

Yes, Dona Trini.

This is your room.
You can do whatever you wish.

Your monthly rent
is three thousand dollars.

What? Three thousand?

Includes meals. Don't worry,
you'll make much more than that.

Listen, is there an oven in the kitchen?

She cooks too?
Yes, and really well.

I could make you
some fried pork and beans.

No way, Missy!
I'll bloat!

And the other girls?

You'll get to know them.

There are hangers in the closet.

And all these clothes?

They are Yuriria's.
But if they fit, help yourself.

Except for this one.

Please, SaintJude,
don't leave me alone!

I've made my way here.

I've done
what I never thought I could.

And not a signal from you!

I hope you're not the kind that goes
on binges. My budget's very tight!

No, Cesar.

Esperanza!

Fidencio? It's Esperanza.

I need to talk to Father Salvador.
Hurry, it's long distance!

Hello?
FaTher? IT's me.!

No, I'm in Tijuana.

Soledad came to see
if I knew where you were.

She wants to find you.

A lot has happened, Father.
I need to confess.

You know you can't confess over the
phone. More so if it's long distance.

You and your rules!

What if I call it a confession
and you call it a confidence?

All right. Go ahead.

I came to this house owned
by this Trini, and I met this gringo.

What?

You said I recommended you.

Forgive me, Mr. Haynes,

but I really needed the job
and somebody gave me your name.

Who is 'somebody'?
Yuriria.

She let me have her room, Mister.

Call me Scott.

Thank you, ''Escot'',
but you're not mad at me?

I won't, until I find out
if I made a good recommendation.

I'll spare you The deTails, FaTher.

I know I'm surrounded by filTh...

buT This man has been
good To me so far.

He's come back several Times.

What's this?

That's four thousand dollars there.

But the last time
you gave me three hundred.

I don't want you having other clients.

But four thousand?
You need more?

No, that's not it. But, why?

I want you only for myself.

He Told me I reminded him
ofhis moTher, FaTher.

''BuTshe musTbe as blonde as you';
I Told him.

''No, iT's The way you look aTme';
he answered.

What a crazy gringo.

So I haven'Thad To worry
abouToTher clienTs.

I jusTdo Things wiTh him,
buTI don'Tknow if They're sins.

If you feel a need of repentance,
then it's a sin.

If not, it's not.
You'll be able to tell.

I jusT wanTmy girl To know ThaTI'll do
anything To rescue her from her TormenT.

I don'Tknow how much
you know abouT women, FaTher,

buTyou wouldn'Trecognize me.

I never ThoughTI could look This way.

Enjoy. She's still tender.

Nobody can be suspicious
of whaTI'm doing.

Be careful, my child.!

Yes.

She is my daughter.

She's so blonde!

I've been able To search for Blanca
everywhere, excepTfor one room.

IT's nexT To Trini's salon,
buT Cesar waTches iTlike a bodyguard.

FaTher, I'm sure my daughTer
is jusTa few feeTaway...

buTSainTJude has forgoTTen abouTme.

He's so unreliable.!

Don't lose faith, my child.

I won't. I have to go now.
It's long distance! Bye!

Esperanza.!

Esperanza!

Lord.

I can't deal with Esperanza anymore.
She's got me crazy.

You know why you sent her down
this road, but I don't have a clue.

If Dr. Ortiz is dead, what do you want
with this poor woman?

It's an enigma I can't solve.

And she hung up on me!

That's why the Church forbids
long distance confessions!

It must be that girl.
I told her to come by in one hour.

Come in.

Ma'am.

I'm going to be straight with you.

Business is off, and the word
about your altar has spread around...

and lots of clients want to see you.
I need you to take care of them.

But Mr. Scott asked me to--

He doesn't have to find out.

Madame Trini, lying to Mr. Scott
won't fix the problem.

What this house need is a spiritual
cleansing, like we do back home.

Why risk your best client?

You'll see what a cleansing can do.

It's vital that I enter every single
room in the house, public and private.

Don't get fresh with me!

No wonder, Dona Trini.
Somebody cast a spell on you!

That must have been Cacomixtle!
But it's out now.

The evil. See?

I need to open every door...

to eliminate any spell
that they may have cast on the property.

Let's go!

Go away!

You must swear
that you'll keep this...

to yourself.

Amen.

Holy Virgin!

There are no girls locked up here!

You're not helping me find Blanca!

Forgive me! Forgive me!

Forgive me!

I don't know whether to hate you,
or to worship you!

First you order SaintJude
to send me on this search,

then you take him away
when I need him the most!

Give me back my Blanca!

Why did you waste my time there?
That Trini doesn't have any girls!

Dona Trini.

I didn't know you liked girls!

Don't be stupid, I don't like girls.
I'm looking for my daughter.

She was kidnapped.

No wonder they took her.

Though her mama is even prettier.

Do you know where she might be?

And do you know who her father is?
Or was it Immaculate Conception?

You don't know what you're
talking about. I'm a widow.

What a pity! Divorcees forget
their husbands quick,

but widows carry them
around their necks like holy medals.

I don't care for threesomes.

Do you have an idea
where she could be?

They might have taken her
to the other side.

You mean the United States?

SaintJude, what am I going to do?
I don't know what's worse,

that she's gone to the Other World
or to the First World.

There's a spot in Los Angeles...

you should check out.

The owner is my buddy, and he knows
where these girls might be working.

Ask for Doroteo.

But I don't even have a passport!

Since when has that been a problem?

PleaseJuan Soldado...

this is your land,
you've helped so many immigrants--

Please hold our hand.

So, are we gonna send you
to a paradise place?

No. I saw your ad.

Unfortunately, I can't choose
till I've interviewed everybody.

Well, let me know soon
so I can tell Mr. Scott Haynes.

What did you say?

Mister Haynes told me to see you.

You should have told me right away.
How do you know Scott?

We're practically related.

He got me out of a fuckin'jam.

They threw me in the can
and he got me out.

They thought I was some fucking guy.

Holy Virgin!

But, hey, ancient story.

I want you to help me with ticketing,
confirmation, money exchange, income tax.

I also sell tickets
for wrestling events, you know?

Yes.

So, what's your name?
Esperanza Diaz.

See you tomorrow at eleven.

Welcome to Paseo Travel.

This apartment's nicer
than the other...

but nobody wants it
because a guy was murdered here.

Don't worry,
I already washed it down,

redecorated, fixed it up nice.

I'll take it.

Terrific! We'll be great pals.
Come on, I'll give you the key.

If the job interests you, it's yours.

Cacomixtle and I
have done a lot of business...

and he always sends good material.

Come with me, I'll give you a tour.

This theater is unique.
There's nothing like it in the world.

Why? Because I created it.

Look, the girls go up these stairs.

Come.

And the clients
can do their browsing down here.

See? Clients can watch their individual
show through these sex-o-scopes.

Go ahead, take a peek.

And what's the show?

The girls put on their uniform...

and do what they normally do
when no one's watching them.

They dress, undress,
comb their hair, masturbate,

battle their cellulite.

But what's the point, Doroteo?

The violation of intimacy.

Please, SaintJude, tell me if I'm
getting warmer or getting colder?

I'm losing hope and don't know
in which oven to look for you.

How will I ever find Blanca
in this city? It's huge!

Vicenta, it's the man who called
this morning. What do I tell him?

Tell the bastard we'll check
for a direct flight and get back to him.

Yes, sir, and you're in luck,
I've got the last tickets.

But hurry! We close at six!

If you have any left, I'll buy you one.

I don't want to miss this match.
It's with the Angel ofJustice, right?

And he's fuckin' hot, man.
I was gonna go by myself...

but if you wanna see the Border Patrol
get stomped, tag along.

What about your night gig?

If they fire me, who cares?
I'll find another job.

Presents the season's
top wrestling match!

That's La Migra.

That's the bad guy, yeah?

Tonight's Referee: Furia!

Entering the ring,
the immigration monster:

Border Patrol!

Risking his Championship of All Masks
tonight and challenging from the heavens:

the Angel ofJustice!

We worship you!
We worship you!

Angel!

Give the pig a tombstone piledriver!

Border Patrol!
Border Patrol!

Look!

Tear him apart!

Slimebag!
How can you do that to him?

Give him a neckbreaker!

Grind his bones!

Hey! Watch it, fucker!

Don't mess with his balls!

Vicenta, careful!

Hide there, you idiot!

Watch out!

This fabulous combat
has come to an end...

with the victory
of the Angel ofJustice...

we'll know the identity
of Border Patrol!

There you have it,
the new champion:

The Angel ofJustice!

Good night.

What a catharsis!

You scared me!
Now what?

I'm looking for the wrestler.
I have his boot.

Angel, are you decent?

It depends.

There's a lady who wants to see you.

Okay.

Won't you be needing this?

You're making me feel like Cinderella.

Why didn't you catch me out there?

We haven't even been introduced.

Heaven forbid!
The Angel ofJustice, at your service.

My pleasure. Esperanza Diaz.

Can I walk you to your car?

No.

Well, I could give you a ride.

I won, you see, and there's a party
with my manager and the boys...

and whoever catches the boot.

How do you have any strength left
to dance after the beating you took?

I dished out more than I took.

I'm really sorry.

Does it hurt?

Here, let me rub it.

No! Don't take my shoe off!. Please.

Are you embarrassed?

But you were carrying my boot.

It's just that have a bad habit
of losing my shoes...

and these are my favorite ones.

Yeah?

Well you can't lose them here.

Who are you?

Don't ask. There's no hurry.

Are you?

Can we see each other soon?

God willing.

May I help you?

Yes.

Your foot!

No, no. You could get hurt.

It looked really awful when he gave you
the flying axhandle. Did it hurt?

The flying axhandle?

Yes, did it hurt much?
No.

Then...

Good night.

Good night.

Did you forget something?

My favorite one!

I'm glad you came back...

because I'm going to give you
the chokeslam, the powerbomb,

and then, I'll unmask you.

And I'll punish you
with the wristlock,

give you a Hurricane, and if you're
not careful, the Crucifixion.

The Crucifixion?

On this side...

Let's see. Catch me!

She gets the Neck Stretcher.

And she gives him the Head Vice!

But he escapes with a Tiger Pounce!

There she goes-- No, no wait!

What are you going to do to me?
Careful, my hair.

There she goes, like a shot!

Now I hold your arms.

And the Crucifixion.
The Crucifixion?

First we roll to our right.

Esperanza, that's a Spine Cracker.

Yes, sir.

And now, the mask!
What are you doing?

No, please, Esperanza, not yet.

You did this to the other guy.
Why can't I?

Off it goes!

But the wrestler covers his face.

She can't see him!

What happened?

Nothing. You unmasked me.

My name's Angel Galvan.

But not even my mom knows my true
identity, so, your lips are sealed.

Saint Anthony,

please don't play a bad joke on me
with this Angel guy.

I've never put your statue upside down
so you'd find me a man.

So, don't make me fall in love with him.

What if he's just playing around?

You send me off in search of Blanca...

and you put an angel on my path!

I can't look for my girl
and fall in love at the same time.

Why don't you two
get your act together?

Fucking whore!

Who do you think you're laughing at?
What are you doing here?

Shut up!

That's how I wanted to see you, slut!

Come here, fucking whore!

That's how I wanted to see you,
Peeping Tom!

Where are you!
Where are you!

Where are you, fucking whore?

There are no little girls here either!

What's going on?

Nothing.Just having a chat
with your friend from Tijuana.

Stop her!

You had to be another bitch!

You ended up all the way up here too?

It's amazing what one will do
for one's children, isn't it?

SaintJude...

please tell me
if I've understood your messages.

We've gone a little too far,
haven't we?

Saint Anthony, I guess
you'll have to wait. I'm sorry.

SaintJude, I'm going back home.

And you better be there.

Good lord!
Just look at you!

Look at you too!

Watch out!

You brought back a refrigerator!

Oh, Dominga. Dominga.

Mama, you and I
will always be together.

I brought you some presents.

Thank you!

SaintJude.

What did you do to the oven?

What do mean?

With this!

I just cleaned it. That's all.

Dammit!

Oh, my Lord!

How are you, Father Salvador?

Esperanza!

Where have you been?

In Los Angeles.

Look at you.

You've changed so much!

Do you want to confess?

I don't know what to do, Father.

I don't know what to do.

Our Father will never abandon you.

He's aware of everything you've done
to find your daughter.

Everything, Father.

Everything.

Mama.

Mama.

My little darling!

You and I will always be together.

Blanquita.

Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

now and at the hour of our--

Let's go outside.
I can't be in church dressed like this.

What are you doing here?

How did you find me?

There is only one Tlacotalpan,
Veracruz, Mexico.

But what are you doing here?

I have orders to find you.

Why did you disappear just like that?

Same way you appeared just like that.

Esperanza, come with me.

I can't, Angel.

Why did you leave so suddenly?

Things happen in a strange way.

Funny, I had to travel so far
to find what was in my own house.

What can I do to convince you?

My daughter!
