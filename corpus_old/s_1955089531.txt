This is the only photograph
I own from my childhood.

It was taken in 1955,
when I was 8 years old,

by my father
with a borrowed camera,

and it's the only thing
I have left from those days...

Except for my memories.

This is a true story.

This really happened to me.

By 1962,

I was 15 years old.

I had 2 brothers and 3 sisters,

no father, no money.

I was the man of the house,

and my mother, well...

She was one of a kind.

Christ!
You out of your mind?

What's the matter
with you, asshole?

All right, all right.

What's the matter with you?

What's the matter with you?

Mr. Owens to the
office immediately!

Mist... aah!

Fucking asshole!
You clean it up yourself!

He's the one that started it!

So did you!

Come on.
Back off! Back off!

He grabbed my ass!

OK, come on!

Oh, come on,
this wasn't my fault!

Owens scared me!

Look, I really need
this job, Mr. Nardin.

You can't do this!
I got kids! Come on!

You're fired.

I'm begging you, pl...
you're fired!

I told you,
I'm going to get money.

I don't have the money now, OK.

You'll get the money later.

I'll have all the money for you.

Get off my back.

Just lay off me on this,

or you won't get nothing, OK?

Just get off my back.

I'm going to get
the money for you.

You'll get the money, man!

Hi, kids.

Hi, mama.

Hi, mama.

Hi, mom.

Faye, how about letting your
old ma sit in her chair?

I don't feel so good, mama.

No? How was the movie?

Well, it was scary.

Flying saucers and monsters.

Annie cried.

Did not!
Did too!

Did not!

Did too!

Did not!

Did too!

Did not!
Did too!

Did not!

You two, pipe down.

Did not, did not!

Did too.

Look, mama.

Oh, isn't that pretty?

Isn't that mine?

I don't know.

Where'd you guys
get all this candy?

I just gave you enough
money to go to the movies.

You took your own popcorn.

Lynn?

I don't know.

Faye?

It wasn't me.

Murray.

Pipe down, you two.

You're giving me an ulcer.

Mrs. Lacey?
Your husband home?

No he's not.
What's the beef this time?

Mama, I was just...
You shut up.

We had a complain from
the phone company.

Your kid had a string of
their coin returns plugged.

That's what you collared him for?
Penny ante crap?

There's real crime,
and you're busting kids

for boosting nickels from the
goddamn phone company?

Tell 'em, ma.
You, pipe down.

I've had a rotten day,

a really rotten day,

and wouldn't be in the mood for this,
if it came with flowers.

You keeping him
or throwing him back?

He ain't worth the paperwork.

Just take this as a warning

and keep your Dillinger
off the street.

Watch the name calling
and get out.

I take care of my own.

Do that, lady, 'cause next time

we might not be
in such a good mood.

So the shoeshine business
has been good lately, huh?

Been doing real good
on tips, you told me.

Well, I did get...

who did you lie to?

Your mother.

Go get your father's belt.

That night,

my mother made a decision.

She didn't bother asking us
what we wanted to do.

She never did.

And once mama made up her mind,

there was no stopping her.

I'm thirsty.

Tomorrow morning we're moving
out of this toilet of a city.

Huh?

Don't "huh" me.

We're going to find
a decent town to live in

and a proper home,
a house of our own.

That's that.

I ain't leaving. I ain't
leaving the neighborhood.

One more "ain't,"
I soap out that mouth.

You're going.
We're all going.

I ain't...
I'm not going.

We're leaving this city.

I don't have the chance
of an ice cube in a frying pan

of making things better
as long as we stay.

I'm sick of moving around.

That's too bad.

You're the man of the house.

Have you forgotten
the promise you made me?

You swore you'd help me with
your brothers and sisters,

that I could
always count on you.

You gave me your word.

Yeah.

I know it won't be easy,

but I can't do it
without you, Shayne.

Now get some sleep.

I'll make you a promise.

You do this for me,

and we'll never move again.

Promise.

So we left L.A.

We sold everything we could.

What we couldn't sell or
fit into our '48 Plymouth

we gave away.

When most families take a trip,
they know where they're going.

Not us.

Mama just pointed the car,

sort of north and sort of east,

and away we went.

Ma, would you tell Murray
and Annie to quit it?

Would you two stop?

Haaa!
Mama!

Nobody gets the bunny.

I did not, Craig!

Yes, you did!

Did not!

Did too!

Mama, I
have to pee-pee.

You just did!

If you kids don't stop this,

I'm going to leave you
by the side of the road!

Annie, you just went.
Pipe down.

Did not!
Did too.

Pipe down, you two!

Did not!

Did not!
Did too.

I'm going to come back there.

You don't want me
to come back there.

Jimmy Johnson, K.I.F.I.

Shayne, leave it for a second.

I'd like to hear just one
song all the way through.

Sorry.

It's my turn up front.

It is not!
Is too!

Now don't you two start.

Murray, sit down.

You stink bug.

Is too.

Is not!

Pipe down!

Shayne, how'd you like
to take the wheel?

Sure.

Scoot over here.

Thanks.

Hey...

How about that place?

It looks like a nice place.

Nope.

I want some orange punch.

Why not?

It ain't the right place.

Then, what is the right place?

I'll know it when I see it.

See...

We'll be driving down this road,

and there's going to be
trees on either side.

And we'll go around the curve...

And there it'll be,

a perfect little town.

Then a little further
on will be our house.

Everything will be
buttoned up and beautiful.

Lynn?
Oh, honey.

Are you all right?

Give her
some kool-aid.

Murray did it.
Murray did it.

Don't spit in it.

Shut up, you little fink.

Cut it out.
Cut it out!

Booger eater, booger eater.

Murray, it better not have
come out of your nose.

See it!

Look at that house.

Yeah.

Mama said we would
find us a house this time,

not an apartment,
but a real house, all our own.

We saw lots of possibilities.

Right there. See?

See that deer?

Look at that. Look at all
that space right there!

Perfect for our house.

I want a pony.

Since we were dead broke,

one question kept nagging at me.

Even if we did
find our dream house,

what could we buy it with?

I wish we lived there.

Hurry up, Murray.

Look out!

We've got you.

Take that!

I can patch your radiator here,

but your water pump's gone.
It's shot.

These belts look like they're
about ready to give way.

And there's maybe one
tire in the whole bunch

that'll see you more than
100 yards down the road.

Will this cover it?

Oh, ma'am.
Your wedding ring?

I don't want to take it.

Don't worry about it.

Goddamn vagabond, Irish
Catholic son of a bitch.

Never gave me anything
but grief and kids.

I'm not sentimental about it.

Is it worth enough
to keep my car going?

Lady, this car's worth
more dead than alive...

But I'll do the best I can.

Everyday, for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner,

we ate egg salad sandwiches.

I haven't eaten one since...
Ever.

We drove through 3 states,

one after another.

By the time we reached Idaho,

we'd reached our limits

physically, mentally,
and mechanically.

Mine!
Mine!

Mine!
Mine!

It's your turn...

I'm not on you!

Shut up!

Mine!
Mine!

Shut up.
Shut up!

There, I broke one of...

Can it!

What is it?

At first,

I thought
we were out of gas again.

But there it was.

I'm not sure what it was,

but mama had
that look in her eye.

Wherever we were going,
we'd just arrived.

Oh!

Mama, you scared me.

Hey, ma,

come up here.

You can see everything.

Hey, mama.

Hey, mama.

All right.

All right, ok, good.

All right, I got it.

Mom, come up here.

Lynn...

Lynn, no, no, no!
Wait.

Murray, come on.
Let's get this guy.

Lacey tribe,

come on.

Hello?

Hello?

The berries are all done.

No more till next year.

All done.

All done.

We don't want any berries.

I want some berries.

Do you know
who owns that property

across the road from you,

the one with the
tumble-down house on it?

Well...
I'm the owner.

I want to buy it.

My name's Frances Lacey.

That's my tribe.

I'd introduce you to
them one at a time,

but life is short
and time is precious.

I don't know if it's for sale.

I want to buy it.

I want it so bad that I'm in
no position to negotiate.

You can take full advantage.
Name your price.

You rich?

I don't have a pot to piss in

or a window to throw it out of.

I have to pee-pee.

If that's the case,

how do you expect
to pay for the land?

Well, Mr. Moon,

I've learned that the dollar

isn't the only way to get things
done in this great country.

Let's talk.

You live alone,
Mr. Moon?

Yes, if it's any
of your business.

Well, here's what we'll do.

We'll wash your dishes,

do your laundry.

Dishes daily.
Laundry once a week.

Clean your house once a week.

My oldest son will give you eight
hours of chores each week,

plus any other work
you may need on call

at minimum wage plus 10 percent.

You pay me interest?

Mr. Moon, this
is slave labor.

Take advantage of it.

You know something?

I'm not so sure if I want
a smart lady like you

with a bunch of kids
for my neighbor.

Yeah, but...

Look at this place.

Takes a lot of work.

How do I know

you won't just
up and run off someday?

Well, if I did that,

then you'd have all that free
labor plus your land back.

But I'm telling you,
Mr. Moon,

if you sell me that land,

I'm building me and my kids a
house we ain't ever leaving,

at least not while
I'm still breathing.

So mama talked herself
into 3 acres of land

with a half-finished
shack on it,

and we kind of took over
Mr. Moon's life.

Mama negotiated
2 days of free repairs

that ended up lasting 2 weeks.

He never knew what hit him.

We had a lot of work to do.

It was already getting cold.

We had to get
a roof on and walls up...

if you call canvas tarp
a "roof" and old boards,

bye-bye, tumbleweed.

Pull over.

Pull it.

Over. Over. Over.

Turn which way?

This way!

Ok.

Ok.

Hurry, here it comes.

Here it comes!

Aah!

I'm going to get you!

Aah!

Aah!

Wait up, pals.

Come on!

Here, Faye.

Yay! Yay! Yay!

Yes!
Yeah!

Mama traded our tires
for some furniture.

Mr. Moon wanted the name of
the guy who bought them.

He said he wanted proof that he
wasn't the only fool in town.

So what do you know how to do?

I work.

I've done it all my life.
I work.

I learn fast, and I
do my share and more.

Yeah, well, I do need
another waitress.

Then you got one.

Minimum wage.

Your tips are your own,

and they ain't
much in this town.

I'll manage.
I always do.

I'll bet you do.

This here's Norman, my manager.

You'll be working under me.

I'll be working for you.

Frances.

Frances.

I tried to get any job I could.

I wasn't particular

as long as I could make money.

I finally got work at a dairy.

I don't know
who hated it more...

me or the cows.

This dumb blanket won't stay up.

I already got some.

Give me a hand, Lynn.

Hey, hey,
Mr. Moon's here!

Thanks.

What are you up to,
Mr. Moon?

You see...

I had all this

spare window glass.

A man with a greenhouse
keeps plenty on hand.

I used some of your wood.

Glazed windows.

And now I'm ready
to put them in.

I don't have the money to
pay you for this, Mr. Moon.

Well...

I'm not doing this

for the money,
Mrs. Lacey.

I do well enough

with the nursery.

Well, I want an
accounting of your time

and the cost of your materials

so I can give
you an I.O.U.

I don't like owing anybody,

but you backed me into a corner.

And I'd appreciate
it a hell of a lot

if you'd let me know next
time you decide to help out.

Come on.

Mama had promised
I'd do Mr. Moon's chores,

so I didn't have much choice.

But running his tractor was fun,

and that's how
I learned to drive.

Hi.

Hello.

How does that look, Craig?

Pretty good.

Let's sleep on the roof.

I want that room.

You can't sleep on the roof!

Mom, can I have my own bathroom?

Can I have a pink
princess phone?

Mom, can I have my own bathroom?

School was coming up,

so when the hand-me-downs
wore out,

the church basement
was our department store.

This wasn't so bad.

It was all we knew.

Lynn, what do you think?

It's beautiful.

You should get it.

Mama.

Oh, no, honey.

Annie.

Lacey tribe.

We need galoshes for winter.

You've never seen winter,
have you, Annie?

No.

Help her pick out a pair, Lynn.

Craig.

Here. Try this on.

Mom, look!

Good day, ma'am.

Uh, I'm Father Tomlin.

I think you may be new
to our little town.

Mom, look what I found.

Hope that we'll see you
at Sunday mass soon.

Try again, liberace.

Unless, of course,
your convictions

take you to another church.

Actually, we Laceys
are nondenominational.

Well, that's neither here
nor there at the moment,

but perhaps I could tell you

about our program
to help the needy.

We can provide without charge

an allotment of clothing for
each member of the family...

Murray, we didn't come here
looking for toys.

Come back here
and try on this sweater.

Uh, in addition to the clothing
items, basic food items...

mama, look!

Lynn, no.

Uh, basic food items and so on,

all without obligation,

religious or otherwise.

Well, thanks very much,
mister, uh... Father,

but we Laceys
don't accept charity.

We pay our own way.

Well, uh,

if... if you
change your mind...

Lynn.

Do me a favor. Take
this back, will you?

But it'll look so nice on you.

Take it back.

The really bad part

was when mama decided
to make our clothes herself.

Hey, Lacey, where'd you get
the howdy doody dresses?

They're not howdy doody.

My mama made them.

Where'd she get the material?

Did somebody shoot a
sofa and skin it?

"Howdy doody dresses"

"howdy doody dresses"

Murray still didn't seem
to fit into our world,

but then one day,

he found one of his own.

Stop the bus!

Stop the bus.
Stop the bus!

Stop the bus.

Get back in your seat, kid.

Stop the bus,

or I'll barf in your hat.

Eew! Eew! Eew!

I'll walk home.

You lost, boy?

No.

No.

I want some of this stuff.

You got money?

Mmm. No.

Well, how do you expect to pay

for the stuff you want?

Well, mister,

I've learned that...

I've learned...

That the greenback dollar
isn't the only way

to get things done
in this here great country.

Let's talk.

All right, son.

Let's find this stuff you want.

I need help around here.

Murray!

What's with the wagon,

and what's with the toilet?

I got a job.
I earned it.

Come on, give me a hand.

You got a job, and
you earned a toilet?

Yeah. So we don't have to
use the dumb old outhouse.

I hate the outhouse.

So for 3 days every week,

Murray came home hauling some
new treasures from Mr. king.

We never knew what to expect...

French doors, a gas stove,

a set of cracked China dishes...

In smelly old
Mr. king,

Murray found a kindred soul,

a fellow connoisseur of junk.

Come on.

Come on what is it?

What did you get
this time, Murray?

Couches and everything.

Wow.

I'm tired.

I got all sorts of stuff.

Mr. Moon?

Yes, miss Faye.

Where's Mrs. Moon?

Well...

She went on a long
journey ahead of me.

Why didn't you go with her?

I had to wait here
for the Laceys.

Every morning,
I went to work in the dark,

then I had to walk
4 more Miles to school.

Sometimes I'd get a ride,

but more often,
I'd walk all the way.

It gave me plenty
of time to think,

and mostly what I thought about

was how much I hated
Hankston, Idaho.

Eh, Murray!
Come on up here.

Come on Murray.

You ready?

Yeah!

Murray, that's disgusting!

Murray!

Just get to work.

I am.

Aah!

Murray!

Murray!

Murray!

Murray, you all right?

Huh?

Murray, come on.

Come on.
Look, Shayne!

Shayne, look!

Look, Shayne!

Shayne, look!

What?

Hold on.
This is going to hurt.

It's going to hurt all right.

Ow!

It should be all right.

You'll be all right.

I'm getting Mr. Moon.

It's all right.

Don't die, Murray.

Stay here.

But Mr. Moon wasn't
home to help us.

He had driven mama into town.

I had to carry Murray
to the hospital.

He was crying all the way.

What the hell happened?

Get him in the truck.

It's not my fault, mama.

He fell on a nail,
and he's bleeding.

Dr. Bartlett, you're needed
in room two.

Mrs. Lacey.

Yes.

You have a very
lucky little boy.

Another, oh,
2 centimeters or so,

and that nail would've
punctured his lung.

Is he ok?
He's fine.

Can I see him?

You can take him home.

Oh!

Just try to keep him in
bed for a couple of days

and keep that wound clean.

You give that to them upstairs.

Thank you.

Interesting kid.

You're ok?

I had made mama a promise.

I told her I'd keep it.

But I wasn't dad,

and I was sick of
pretending I was.

I knew that when
the house was done,

I was going back
to L.A.

There was more to do,
I had friends there,

and it was a lot warmer.

Warm it up for you?

Yes.

And he says, "you're not
here for the hunt, are you?"

Can I get you anything else?

We're out of here, Franny.

How about you and your
tribe helping us out

over on that remodeling job?

We'd be on the job site, not
loafing around over here.

Woh! Wooo!

I'm short of cash this week.

This will have to do for a tip.

You're kidding.

Dave, this means
more to me than money.

Let's go.

In Los Angeles,
mama worked her butt off

just to get us from day to day.

Now we all had to earn
enough to live on

and put something away
for our house.

We all worked on that house
every chance we got,

but there were some things
we couldn't do,

so mama hired contractors
for those jobs.

God help 'em.

Over here!

Yeah, sure,
we can take care of it.

I know you guys,

you buy your goddamn
wiring and your fixtures,

you mark it up 20, 50 percent,
and you soak me for it.

I want an estimate
for manpower only

and a list of what
material you'll need.

I'll haggle for
the materials myself.

Any questions?

I ain't got much time.

I got to get to my job.

I know you think
I'm a hard-nosed bitch.

Don't deny it.

I am when it comes
to this house.

But I also know
I'm at your mercy.

Treat me honestly
like I'll treat you.

I'll deal in cash,

so we may have to
do this piecemeal,

but there won't be
any corner cutting.

I want the best for this house.
The best.

Lacey tribe.

Show Mr. Whitman
your hands.

Every penny you spend is a penny

me and these
little hands earned.

Don't make those blisters
count for nothing.

There. I've tried it all...
guilt, fear, and pity.

You understand me now,
Mr. Whitman?

You're shirt.
You're skin.

Laughlin, get a haircut
or a dog license.

You look like an animal.

Stand up straight like a man,

not like some old woman.
There you go.

Lacey.

Yeah?

Just what the hell is that?

Well, my sister's red socks
got in with the whites,

and it turned the sheets and
pillowcases and the t-shirt

kind of pink.

Go get another one.

Well sir, this is
the only one I got.

What, are you kidding?

Lacey, I told you at the
beginning of the term

that you'd require a white
t-shirt, did I not?

Yes, you did.

White. Is that white?

No, sir, it's a little off.

A little off?

I'd call that titty
pink, huh, guys?

You're a shirt. You're a skin.
Let's go.

Let's move it, guys.

Let's go!
Lacey. Lacey.

Listen, uh, why don't you just
go play with the girls?

Better yet,
sit on the girls' bench.

Your titty pink shirt will fit
in a lot better over there.

Right over there
between the two girls.

All right, guys, come on!

Everybody over here.
Let's go!

Shirts, you're going that way.
Skins, that way.

Your grade depends on this.

Her name was Raymi,

and I couldn't have met her

under more embarrassing
circumstances,

but at last I had one good
reason to stay in Hankston.

You can't take that test.

You can't even read.

I can read as good as you.

Mom, Murray needs a compass
and protractor for school.

Can't he borrow one?

Mrs. Tipton said he has
to have a set of his own

or she'll flunk him.

I'll give you money
when you go back to school.

Mama,

I still feel sick.

Just stay in bed, honey,
and keep warm.

We'll save you something.

Wait, Shayne!

Mom, I need a new white
t-shirt for gym class.

Damn, Shayne.
Another one?

Yes.

Take the potatoes and the gravy.

Everybody sit down.

You see, it's gotten
kind of green.

Murray's green pants
got in with the whites.

Green, white, red, blue.
What's the difference?

What do you want, gold lami?

Everybody else's is white.

I got to have
a white t-shirt.

Don't you tell me
what you got to have.

You got to have a roof over your
head and food on the table,

and you got that. You're
not getting a new t-shirt.

Hi, Mr. Moon.

Hi, Mr. Moon.

Pumpkin.
Made them myself.

Still warm.

Mr. Moon,
please come in.

Sit down.
Let me take your jacket.

Thank you.

Happy Thanksgiving, Laceys.

Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Moon.

Faye's not feeling well.

Are you a praying man,
Mr. Moon?

I'm a failed Catholic...

But, yes.

We're not religious either,

but a taste of it couldn't hurt,

and who knows?
It might take

on one of these heathens.

Lord, we have much
to give thanks for...

But this year,

I have a special thanks.

Thank you,

for the Lacey family,

which came into my life,

and turned it upside-down

and made...

Made it much more interesting.

And my house,

is very clean.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.
Amen.

Give it back.

Busy.

Can you hold it?

I don't know.

It's freezing.

Hey.

I wiped that butt a long time
before you did, you know.

Next thing we're working
on is indoor plumbing.

Hey, there.

Hi, Norm.

Uh, Dave Pollock
left this for you.

Beautiful.

A 4-d fuse box
in perfect condition.

Don't get all hot and
bothered over a tin box.

Well, we make do
with what we got.

It's the best thing that's
happened to me all day.

How about I take you to
Crossroads after we close?

They got a band.

I got to get home to my kids.

Just a few minutes
kicking up your heels

one night in... How long?

I don't even remember.

See.

One drink, one dance,
straight home.

I got some old
electrical conduit

I'll throw into the bargain.

How much conduit
we talking about?

How much can you handle?

Norman, if it isn't connected
to this, I ain't interested.

But I will go dancing with you.

One beer, one dance,
and then home.

That'll be all for you?

There's mom.
Hi, mom.

Hi, mom.

Hi, mom.
Tips were good tonight.

Murray, get the jar.

What's that?

I saved you some supper.

Oh, well, I already ate.

Here's some ham
sandwiches for tomorrow.

I've been thinking.

This Christmas, we don't need
to get each other presents.

We'll get presents
for our house.

Like a television?

Well, maybe not like a
great big old television.

What about Santa?

Well, he'll get presents
for our house, too.

Can Santa bring a TV?

It's too big, dummy.

Shut up, Annie. I want a TV.

What do you think?

It's ok with me.

I like the idea.
Fine with me.

What do you think?

Sure.

Huh?

Sure.
You were late.

What?

I said you were late.
Where were you?

I went for a beer.

Really?

With Norm?

Yes, with Norm.

You listen to me.

You leave my private life
to me, Shayne Patrick,

what little I have of it.

This weekend we get the tree!

Yay! Yay! Yay!

When you're really, really poor,

everything you see

is something you can't have.

Shayne?
Yeah.

What are you going to
get mama for Christmas?

I don't know.

Maybe some stockings.

I saw her crying last night
when she ruined her last pair.

I thought we were supposed to
get presents for our house.

That's just talk, that's all.

You sure?

We wrote that letter to Santa.

Yeah. You know
how mom always talks.

Does that mean
I get a Bowie knife?

No.

Coming through.
Coming through.

Step aside.

Thanks.

Wait, wait.

When I was a kid,
we had an old bathtub.

It was so big,

I could lay down up to my chin.

My knees would
still be underwater.

I'd read for hours.

The books would get all fat and
crinkly from the dampness.

Did you live in
a house of your own?

Yeah. Lived there
until I left.

How's Santa going to come
if we don't have a chimbly?

It's chimney.

He'll have to come
through the keyhole,

like he did in Los Angeles.

Dummy!
You're the dummy!

Dummy!
You are.

No, you are.

The water's getting all gunky.

Look who's in it.

Why am I always last
to take a bath?

'Cause nobody wants to wash
after you've been in there.

Well, I'm done.

Not so fast, young man.

Let me see those ears.

I cleaned them.

Oh, Murray. You could
plant potatoes in there.

Ouch!

Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
I'm sorry, baby.

You're getting to be an independent
little snot, aren't you?

Hello again,
Mrs. Lacey.

Every year,

we pass out these presents

to the needy children...

needy children?
Good for you Father!

I suggest you find some.
There's none here.

I'm sure your children would
appreciate some gesture...

my children's gifts
are already under the tree.

Merry Christmas.
Good night, Father.

Let's get ready for bed.
Santa's almost here.

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Murray, look! Santa came!

Santa drank the milk!

Look! Look! Look!

Santa came!

Come on!

Presents!
I saw them! No!

Stop it. We have to
wake up mom first.

Come on.

Mom! Mom! Mom!

Ok! Ok!

Mom! Mom! Mom!

Where's mine?

Yeah, where's mine?
Where's mine?

Oh! Santa came!

Here. I found mine.

Oh, Lynn.

Thanks.

I wonder why this is so heavy.

Ready?

One...

Two...

Three!

Save the paper.

Why?

I bet I know what this is.

Oh, Lynn!

Did you make these yourself?

What's wrong?

They're presents for our house.

Remember?
We talked about it.

This is not a house.

This is not Christmas.

We live in a shack.

A shack!

We have nothing of our own.

Everything we did have, we either
sold it or left it behind...

we have nothing!

It's supposed to be
Christmas, goddamn it!

It's Christmas!

You watch your mouth,
Shayne Patrick Lacey.

Well, I like what I got.

All that money we earned,
and nothing.

You're mad 'cause you didn't
get a stupid t-shirt.

Shut up, Murray!

All they wanted was
some toys or a radio...

you know what?

You care more about this stupid
shack or this stupid house idea

than you do about any of us!

Go get your father's belt.

Go get it.

I'll get it.

Ooh. Merry Christmas.

I was going to...

Merry Christmas,
Mr. Moon.

I know you had told me
not to bring any presents,

but...

This is for the house.

Uh, Lynn,
get Mr. Moon his present.

It's a mailbox.

We got the spelling off
the contract,

and Shayne made it
in shop class.

Yes. Thank you.

What is this?

Plans.

The blueprints for
the rest of this house.

It's not like your picture.

It's one-story ranch
with 2 bedrooms,

but that can be changed.

It's a good, solid plan.

I really appreciate it,
Mr. Moon,

but we're set on
building our own house.

Merry Christmas.

You...

Are a stubborn woman,
Mrs. Lacey.

What's wrong in here?

Santa Claus hates me.

Mr. Moon...

Could you give me
a ride into town?

Yes, ma'am.

I'll be ready in a minute.

I'll be warming up the truck.

Merry Christmas.

Happy new year.
Happy new year.

Thank you very much,

and a Merry Christmas to you.

Excuse me, Father.

Oh, Mrs. Lacey.

I certainly didn't
expect to see you here.

Well, actually, Father,

I was hoping to take you up
on your offer.

Would you have any
of those presents left?

Uh, I took your advice.

I gave them
to a truly needy family.

So you have no gifts?

You know,

the best gift
that you could give them,

would be to bring them
all here to church.

Father Tomlin,
that was wonderful.

Thank you. I greatly
enjoyed that sermon.

I have money.
I can pay.

I'm... I'm sorry,
Mrs. Lacey.

We... we have none.
I'm sorry.

Is it warm enough in there?

Warm enough.

Why didn't you finish
this place, Mr. Munimura?

I started it for my boy.

He went into the Navy.

He was a pilot...

Flew jet.

Married a nice Japanese
girl from Hawaii.

They were going to move here

after their tour in Korea.

Munimura and son.

Korea...

He wanted to fight.

Michael wanted to prove

he was as American
as anyone else.

Chieko and I started this place.

It was going to be a surprise.

He didn't come back.

His wife went on with her life.

Chieko died the next year.

I'm sorry about the blueprints.

I shouldn't have said that.

I didn't even look at them.

No, no.

You have a right
to your kind of house.

Chieko and I started this place

so there'd be a family
someday here.

You and your tribe are
more than Chieko hoped for

as far as the number
is concerned,

but you saw something here
the day you drove up

in that rattletrap Plymouth.

Don't forget what you saw.

Merry Christmas,
Mr. Munimura.

Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Lacey.

Mama...

You didn't open the rest
of your presents.

Tomorrow.

Mama, come over here.

I got to finish the dishes.

Come on.
No, I mean it. I got to.

Oh, good. They fit.

Oh, good.

Oh, God, I'm so tired.

I'm just so damn tired.

W-well, maybe
you should go to bed.

It's not that kind of tired.

Sometimes I don't think I can...

I feel like I'm...

Pushing a car uphill...

a... a big car
like our Plymouth...

up a steep hill,

and I'm... I'm pushing
and pushing,

and... and I push,
and I look down,

and I can see
the ground under my feet,

and then I look up,
and I can see all you,

kids in the back seat.
Looking at me,

and... and I'm pushing...

But, mama, we're not in the car.

We're helping you push.

Yeah.

Yeah, you are.

Of course, mama.

We're the Lacey tribe.

It just feels like you're
pushing alone sometimes.

Here.

You open this one.

That's from Annie and Craig.

We helped, but just a little.

Look at that.

It was a long, long winter.

Mama and I were still fighting,

and being cooped up
in that shack didn't help.

There wasn't anything to do

or anywhere to go.

I like that one.

That's mine.
That's mine.

Look at that.

That looks...

oh! Look at that one.

Hello.

Hi, kids.

Hi, mom.

Hi, mom.
Hi, mom.

Oh, what a pretty picture.

Did you paint that?
Hmm-mm.

Who is that?

That's you, that's
Craig, that's Shayne,

and that's me,
and that's Murray.

Hey...
What is this?

What the hell are you doing,

you little snot, huh?

Shayne, watch it.

This is my history book.

You've ruined my book.

Who cares?

It's pretty.

You draw in it every day.

Yeah.
Naked women.

Shut up!
I'll smack you both!

Shayne Patrick,
watch your mouth.

Wait a minute.

Where's my homework?

Huh?

Where is it? Huh?

Shayne, I'm warning you.

I don't know!

Tell me! Tell me!

Get your father's belt.

Get it yourself.

No, mama.
Please, mama.

Listen to me.
When are you going to listen?

Stop it.
You're hurting me.

Stop it, mama!

Mama!

Stop it!

Stop it, mama!
Stop!

Stop, please.

I didn't speak to my mother

or look her in the eye
for 5 days

after she took
my dad's belt to me.

I didn't think she even cared.

You and I remember him best.

Craig and Annie are too young.

Do you ever get mad at him?

What...

For leaving us like this?

Sometimes.

I get mad at him for a whole
bushel basket of things,

but you can't really blame

that goddamn vagabond, Irish
Catholic son of a bitch

for dying, can you?

No.

Just...

Sometimes I wish things
were a little different.

You don't want to be
the man of the house.

I know what you have to give up,

the things you can't do
at school.

You don't have any friends.

You have responsibilities.

I was a kid myself
once, too, you know.

Wanted to go to parties,
have fun,

dance my life away,
dance with all the boys,

neck until the sun came up,

but this is what I got.

This is what happens sometimes.

You work with what you get,

and you try to make it better.

I'll pick you up
around 3:00.

Thanks. See ya.

Mom, it's cold.

Are you ok?

Yeah.

It's going to be beautiful.

We'll finish the first
floor this summer.

We'll do some exterior work,

then next year we'll start
on the second floor.

You'll have your own room.

It's going to be all
buttoned up and beautiful.

Yeah.

Mom...

Can I ask you a question?

Hmm?

Can I go on a date?

Sure.

I can?

I've been known to go on a date

once or twice myself, you know.

Really?

Mom...

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry about
being mad at you.

You know, for going
to dinner and...

Going on that date.

Mama went all out
for the occasion.

We went to the thrift shop

and picked out a jacket,
slacks, shoes...

They were used, but they
were the best I ever had.

You look nice, Shayne.

Oh, thanks, Faye.

You going to squeeze
her boobies?

All right. I'll get you.

I'll get daddy's belt on you.

You boys.

Oh, mom.
You look great.

Really?
Yeah.

You look really nice.

Look at you, Shayne.

Ain't he a handsome devil?

Looks just like his father,

that goddamn vagabond...

Irish Catholic son of a bitch.

Are you going to
the dance with Shayne?

I got my own date.

That's them.

You'll never get a date,
Murray, you stink bug.

Are you excited?
Yeah.

I'm nervous.
Are you?

Here.
Don't tell the others.

I knew what that money
meant to mama...

And to our house.

Bye, Shayne.
Bye, Shayne.

Bye, mama.
Bye.

Good luck on your date.

Ok.

That dollar meant more to me,

than anything she ever gave me.

You never forget
your first real date.

I didn't know how to dance,

much less how to ask a girl
to dance with me.

It sure was different
than practicing with mama,

but I had the first,
best time of my life.

"Oh, don't you know?"

"don't you know
you'll be my fool?"

"you got me cryin'"

"cryin' again"

"when will you let
this heartache end?"

"emotion"

"you gave me up then"

"why make me remember"

"what I wanna forget?"

May I have the pleasure?

Well, Norman.

Dance with me, Frances.

Well, let's go on inside.

It's cold out here.

Well, I'm a good
keeper-warmer.

Norman...
What?

Come on.
Let's go dance...

we're definitely kicking up
our heels tonight, but...

After.
After?

What is this?

This is the key to paradise.

You're presuming a bit,
aren't you?

I don't think so.

You're free, white, and
more than a nod past 21.

Thanks a lot.
Yeah, we both are.

We'll get it out of the way.

Save some awkwardness, and we
don't smell like cigarette smoke.

'Sides, I drink too much
when I dance,

and I ain't worth
a shit in the sack then.

Well, that's romantic
as all hell.

Look, it's paid for.

Why waste it? Come on.

Hey, what are you doing?

Either we go dancing
or take me home.

Oh! Don't act
like no virgin.

What?

A woman with six kids
has been around the block.

I don't roll on my back,

for every asshole
who scratches my belly.

You ought to. Not many
guys will make this offer.

I should be so lucky.

Come on, honey.

Let go of me!

Take your hand off me.
Take your hand off me.

Settle down.

This isn't going to happen.

Are we going to stand here
until the snow comes again?

Let go!

Don't tell me what to do!

I could make you.

You could try.

Come on, guys.
Let's go.

Come on.
Will you get out of there?

You're steaming up the windows.

Hey, guys.

Let's go.

Ha ha ha.

"Since I first met you."

"I pray..."

See you, lover boy.

Bye, Raymi.

Hey, mom, what you doing?

Sitting.

Go on in.

I'll be in in a minute.

Are you ok?
Yeah.

I'm fine.

How was your date?

It was all right.

How was yours?

Mom?

Mom?

What happened?

I just made a mistake,
that's all.

I don't know what it is,

but if there's a son of a bitch

within 70 Miles, he'll find me.

Been that way
since your daddy died.

Any horse's ass.

I just walk right up
to him and s-say,

"here I am, you asshole."

"Why don't you chew me up
and spit me out?"

Mom, I'm sorry.

It's going to be ok, ok?

I promise.

Honey, it's not your
fault, it's his.

Now go on, will you?

It's going to be ok, mom.

Come on.

It's going to be all right.

Was dad ever mean to you?

No.

He was the finest man
I ever met.

He treated me like a queen.

Promise me something, Shayne.

Promise me you'll never
beat on a woman.

Yeah, I promise.

Never beat on anybody.

It hurts,

inside and out.

Yeah.

I know it does.

Go to bed.

But...

please.

Go to bed.

What is it?

Annie.
Annie, wake up.

Are you all right?

All right.

You look beautiful today.

You mind me saying that?

It's true.
You really do.

Now... This spot
down here...

Ok.

Uhh!

Aah!

You hit my mother!

Aah!

Oh!

Crazy little bastard.

Call the sheriff!

Somebody!

Aah!

Say you did it!
Come on!

Say you did it!
Say you did it!

Say you...
say you did it!

Say it!

Say it now!
Now!

I never touched her!

Where'd you get the scratch?

'Cause she fights
just like you do.

Ohh!

Ohh...

Uhh...

Mr. hilliard.
Yeah.

Can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

Sure.

Um...

I can't work here anymore.

Why?

I quit. I can't work
here with Norman,

not after what he did to my boy.

Uh-huh. Well, Norman
doesn't work here anymore.

I let him go.

Really?

Yeah, really.

So if Norman's the problem,

you really don't have a problem.

And listen, Frances...

Why don't you take the day off?

And I'll see you in the morning.

Ok?

Things will get better.

You'll see.

Lacey tribe, may I have
your attention, please?

What do you want, Murray?

Just come here.
It's a surprise.

Too busy.

You're never too busy for this.

Come on, hurry up.

Yeah, hurry up.

One...

Two...

Three!

Aah! Ha ha!

Lacey tribe!
We're coming up in the world!

Indoor plumbing.
Who gets the first turn?

Ooh, I do.
I do.

I do.

Craig! Shayne!

Come down here!

Murray!

Come on!

Bye, outhouse!
Yeah!

Murray, what are you doing?

Dirty.

Ok, this is dirty.

Clean.

Annie, look at this spot.
It's dirty.

Whoopee-doo.
A little spot.

Look at that thing burn.

Yeah!

Yeah, cool!

Great!

Look at that thing burn!

Hanky.

All right!

Yeah!
Yay!

Yeah!

I don't have to go to that
stinking outhouse anymore!

I hate that outhouse!

What?

It's burning!

Craig, Annie,
go to Mr. Moon's!

Get him to call the
fire department! Go!

Hurry!

Murray, come on!

Come on, Murray!

Come on!

It's frozen.

Aah!

The red dress.

With the white bows.

Good for you.

Matching lipstick, too.

Hey, look at that smoke.

Where?

Right there. Isn't that
close to your house?

Oh, my God.

I'm going to get the money jar.

Boys, get down from the roof!

Murray, get out of here!
It's too hot!

Are you ok?

What happened?
I'm sorry, mama.

Are you ok?

Where's Lynn?

Mommy, Lynn went
back in the house!

She's in the house!

Lynn!

Lynn!

Lynn!

Lynn!

Lynn!

Lynn!

Mama, I couldn't find
the money jar.

Doesn't matter.
Are you ok?

Got to find it.

By the time they got there,

there was nothing
the firemen could do.

I even remember
the way they put it...

"the structure
was fully consumed."

I think the less you have,

the more it hurts
when you lose it,

and that fire hurt a lot.

Murray.

Sorry, mama.

I'm so sorry.

Oh, honey...

It's not your fault.

Not your fault.

I just burnt down our house.

Oh...

Listen.

It was an accident.

It was an accident, honey.
It's nobody's fault.

Oh, baby...

It's nobody's fault.

Come on.

Save the nails.

Unh!

Ha ha!

Oh. Lynn, everything's
going to be all right.

We can start over.

Ha ha!

Everything's going to be all
buttoned up and beautiful.

Bullshit!

Nothing's going to be all right.

You're only saying that...

"buttoned up
and beautiful."

Don't tell them that
if they're good,

everything will work out.

It doesn't work that way.

"Buttoned up and beautiful"?

You're always saying that!

And we believe it,
and it hurts us

every time we have
to hear it from you!

Don't lie to them!

I don't know what to
say to you, Shayne.

I don't know what
you want to hear.

I guess you want a different
family, a different life.

Well, it isn't going to happen.

This is what you got.

You think I don't want
something more?

Life isn't fair, buddy.

Sometimes it's just
goddamn lousy.

You want to go back
to Los Angeles?

Go on. We'll manage
without you.

You don't have to be the
man of the house anymore.

We'll manage just fine.

I managed without your dad.

I don't know how I did
that, but I did it.

We'll manage without
a lot of things.

Go on, get the hell out of here.

Mama.

Mr. Moon!

Mr. Moon!

Come on, pull up over here!

Mrs. Lacey,

I know you don't take charity.

You'll be getting a bill.

Let's go, let's go, everybody!

Mr. Munimura,
I can't accept this.

I can't owe people.
I can't.

We're going to do it

no matter what you say, Frances.

It's going to be ok.

Let's go to work!

Thank you so much.

Mama.

Mama.

Mama.

Look at all
the pretty toys you got.

My goodness.

I think we're level.

Come on!

I don't know. Should it go
over there a little bit?

Watch the fingers!

There you go.

So mama let them build it...

But just to where it was
before the fire.

After that, it took us six
months to finish our house...

And 4 years
to pay everyone back.

Ok Mr. Moon, come on!
Mom! Get everybody!

I took a picture
the day we moved back in.

This camera was borrowed, too.

Now I'll tell you something
else that's really true,

but you probably
won't believe it.

I've never been
back to L.A.,

and I still live
in Hankston, Idaho.

Whatever tore us apart,

building that house
brought us together...

Forever.

We...

Were the Lacey tribe.
