Hey...

NAGASAKU Hiromi

Takashi

What are you doing here?

I just finished work
Want a ride?

Yusuke Santamaria

Call if you're going to be late

EMOTO Akira

DOPPELGANGER

<i>As you can see, violent waves
are pounding</i>

<i>the beach here on the Kii Peninsula</i>

<i>As we heard earlier...</i>

What?

What?

Welcome back

How'd you get back?

What do you mean, how?

Weren't you just at
Home lmprovements

Home lmprovements?
Are you crazy?

What?

Oh, no, did I mistake
someone else for you?

How embarrassing

Takashi, can you get the phone?

I've got my hands full here.

Yes, hello?

<i>Nishimori Police here
ls this Nagai Takashi's residence?</i>

Yes, it is

<i>And you are...</i>

I'm Takashi's sister

<i>I see. You'd better come
straight to the Chuo Hospital</i>

Um, um...
Did something happen to Takashi?

<i>He just passed away</i>

What?

<i>The investigating officer
believes it was a suicide</i>

Oh, you have the wrong person
Takashi's here at home

<i>But,</i>

<i>we got your number
from his student lD</i>

Please wait a minute
I'll put him on the line

Takashi, will you come here?
There's a strange phone call

Takashi?

Oh, no...

Takashi?

<i>At Medical Cytech Corp.,</i>

<i>we continue to develop
visionary medical equipment</i>

<i>through unique ideas and
constant technical innovation</i>

<i>For individuals suffering
paralysis after a spinal cord injury,</i>

<i>were developing
the Artificial Human Body Chair</i>

<i>A simple sensor around the neck,
communicates your every wish</i>

<i>The ultimate nursing care robot</i>

<i>Its radical flexibility even
lets you chase a tennis ball</i>

<i>A little reading when you're bored...</i>

Shut that damned thing off

Yes

I'm sorry

Maybe my will's too weak

Maybe so

Takano, adjust the sensors

Yes

What are you doing. Aoki?
Record that data

Yes

Don't you think we should try
simplifying the information stream?

What?

I mean, the human will
is fairly complex

We've known that all along

Well, yes

The product's useless unless
it obeys commands universally

That's why it makes sense
to try simplifying it

I thought the point was to rep icate
the complexity of human behavior

Get with it

Yes

Say, Hayasaki

Didn't you once say you wanted
to develop a new pacemaker?

Yeah

Got any?
Good ideas?

Nope

Oh, right

Get to the point

What?

That project would be easier
to allocate funds for

Since when were you
my enemy?

What?

We're all on your side

You have no enemies
in this corporation

We a l ive off that b ood pressure
instrument of yours

Don't talk about the ancient past

Sorry

I'l get the funding
Keep on working

Try not to be such a perfectionist

Do you need that data?

No, I don't!
Who needs a useless log of failures

Here you are
Thanks

We all work too hard

You're right

Can I ask you something?

Sure, what?

Do you be ieve in paranormal
phenomenon, Hayasaki san?

No, I don't
That stuff on TV, right?

The brother of a friend of mine,
ki led himself recent y

Huh

And according to his sister,

he died because he'd
seen his doppelganger

Doppelganger?

Like a double
They say if you see it, you die

But,

some psychologists claim
to have similar cases

When people see
their exact double

I imagine her brother
was in denial

That he was burdened
with some terrible pressure

What's your opinion?

My opinion?
Sorry, I'm not interested

Hey there
Key please

Hey, it's gone
Didn't you take it?

No, no, I didn't
What?

Yeah, I'm much better now

What?

I haven't touched his room

I can't just throw away his things

Yeah, more or less

I'm fine
Don't worry

Yeah, yeah...
Thanks

I'l call you

Yeah, bye, now

The President wants to
promote you to management

What do you say?

I think it's a nice way of
kicking you out of research

Isn't it about time
you considered taking it easy?

A management position
isn't so bad, you know

Murakami, I'll never work
for anyone but myself

When you don't need me, fire me
Tell that to the President

All right, I will

It's just...

For you to continue your research,
we need a little ritual. You understand

No, no way

That machine isn't ready yet

Don't be so stubborn
It's your duty to report on your work

I'll write up a report
But I won't unveil the machine

I told you, it's just for the executives
A hoop to jump through

lf you have to show it to them,
just take it! Leave me out of it

I'll go make some coffee

Yeah

Are you OK?

Yeah

Is it Murakami san?

No, that's not it

Recently I've been...

You've been what?

Someone's been stalking me

Sta king?

Wow, that's a drag

Is it a woman?
Or a man?

Oh, thanks
Sure

Listen, Takano

Remember that...
Who was it?

The person you know
whose brother killed himself?

Yeah

How's she been, since?

She said things had settled down

Huh...

And her brother?

I mean that, the...

Doppel... ganger?

But her brother's dead

Oh, right, right, right

That's right
Silly me

Maybe I'm cracking up...

Welcome
Welcome

Anyone joining you?
Oh, no

Call me when you're ready

The same

What?

Like I said, the same

The same as what, sir?

What's that?

Coffee
That, then

Right away

Thank you

You're really stuck, aren't you?

Get out
This is my house

Huh?

I'll call the police

Like you're such a hotshot

Who are you?

Me? I'm you

I'm Hayasaki Michio

I'm Hayasaki Michio, too

What kind of nonsense is this?

Just hurry up and disappear

What do you mean? I turned up
here because fe t sorry for you

I'm overworked
I'm losing my mind

Hey, what are you doing?

I'm hallucinating

Man, you're uptight

I'm offering
to help you accomplish

what you can't do on your own

Hard to dream up
a better partner

I still hear him

You all right?

The figment's saying something
I can't listen

That's just it

This inflexibility of yours
has been dragging you down

Why the hell do I have to
listen to me lecturing myself?

You've got big plans, remember?

I have no intention of
discussing them with you

Neither do I

Get out

All right

And...
stop driving around in my car

I had to walk home
because of you

And you.

stop calling me a sta ker

Everything's ready.
Hayasaki san

Right

Let's begin

Are you OK?

Yeah

We pulled it off

Pulled what off?

That's not an artificial body

The way Murakami applauded
How tota ly humiliating

Can I say something,
Hayasaki san?

I think you need to consider
Murakami san's fee ings

You're a genius, Hayasaki san

No one knows that better
than Murakami san

In addition, you're
in a slump right now

Get to the point

We're all hoping,
all us employees are

That you'll come up with
another amazing invention

That's why

Murakami san and I are trying,
somehow, to pull you out of your slump

I'm hardly much use,
so it's not for me to say

But I'm incredibly proud
to be working with you

Let's work hard
And meet their expectations

They only think of themse ves

A heavy load, huh?
Their expectations

Yeah...

What are you staring at?

The budget's up 150%
No complaints, right ?

Right

Now you get to buy that
super computer you wanted

OK, right?
Sign off on it

When we perform that ritual
for our President next month,

let's give him a real nice shock

Leave everything to me

Hayasaki
You did this

Do you hate my way of
doing things so much?

You're incomprehensible

Hi, Takano?

No, no, forget it
I've been fired

No, no, it's fine I've been fired

Yeah, that's right

It's strange
I'm kind of relieved

Actually, I'd hit my limit

I see, he's still here?

He is

The doppelganger?

I don't know
But he's there

In my house
Even now

And what's this other brother
of yours doing at home?

Writing a novel

A novel?

Yes, the deadline for
the Newcomer's Award

that magazine sponsors
is coming up

Takashi always dreamed
of winning it

I see

But the Takashi I knew
was never that way

He was a slacker,
weak-willed.

totally dependent on me

Frank y, I'm happier
with the new Takashi

But...
My brother

probably met his ideaI self

and wound up facing
his own limitations

That's why I think
he killed himself

How are things with you?

I'm sorry. I wasn't istening
What?

Oh...
How are things with you?

Oh, my situation
is hardly that serious

I see

In that case,
you'll get used to it

You have no choice

Hey, lazybones
Off we go

This is hardly the time to
brood over the past

That's exactly the thing
that's holding you back

Hey!

Hey, off we go!
Hey

Off we go

Hey, c'mon, we're going
Hey

Hey, hey
Hold on now

OK, here we go

No

Why not?

I don't have a c ue
what's going on anymore

What'll we do with you?
Stop whining

No, no, no, no!

I can't do it alone

Leave me alone!

Hey

Hayasaki san
You still working?

Yes
What brings you here?

Not to worry

Shall I help you?

Huh?

Takano...

I'm sorry
It's all my fault

It's an honor to be of service

OK, OK, OK, stop

Thanks
Oh, no

Make up some story for Murakami
Yes

Here

Excuse me

I'll remember you...

for the rest of my life

Me, too

Takano

Yes?

What the hell have you done!

What?

To Takano,
by the door back there

Nothing

Liar!

I only did what you wanted to

I knew you did it

Did what?

I'll leave your lunch here

Don't bother me

My brother's gone

Really?

He's totally different

<i>He doesn't seem
to need me anymore</i>

Huh...

He's someone else
He's not Takashi

Even though he looks the same

Of course he is

What am I supposed to do?

ls Takashi finally, really dead?

Or will have to keep dealing

with that completely different,
other Takashi forever?

That's a tough one

Yes, it is

But, you know

I think the doppe ganger and
the self are entirely distinct

Oh, that's right, you said so, too
That he was a different person

So...

It's like having a twin,

or a chance resemb ance, so...

So...

So... right

I think it means your brother's
finally really dead

You think so?

Yeah

Awful

It's too awful

That's not what I meant

What did I do to deserve this?

I'm starting...
to not give a damn anymore

Sorry

Leave everything to me
OK?

What the fuck!
Hey! Get off!

Move!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry

Excuse me, I'm sorry

I'm sorry, I'm sorry

You, again

This thing's pretty handy

Don't touch my machine

Hey. hey, hey
Don't eat that crap

Look, I brought you
some yummy stuff

Wow, looks good

Did you do something bad?

Don't be such a wimp

I'm going to wind up
responsible for everything

The cops?

Why do you think like that?
It's just the opposite

Whatever you do,

as long as I get caught,
you're safe

Can't you even figure that out?

Not that I really care

Just get out of here
I've got a ton to do

AlI right, that's the way

OK, then
I'll be off

You are pleased, right?

What are you?

I was told to come here

What?

Your brother hired me

Wow, so this is
the artificial whatever

Pretty tacky

Shut up
Put that stuff over here

So, what do I do?

Sit here

For real?

Yeah, it's for real, real
You're an emp oyee. No back-talk

Try grabbing this

What?

Here goes...
Go

Grab it

You fuckin' around?

I am not
I can't grab it

Your wil 's too weak

Get out of there
Start over

You look exact y like him
Your brother

What?

It creeps me out
Like you're his double

Don't say that
Ever again, got that?

Lift both arms

Good

That's good, good, good

OK, now slowly try
raising them to your sides

Good

OK, lower them

Hey

Huh?

Hey

You can do it

Why'd you take 'em off
They're cool

Shut up

Whatever
Everything groovy?

Yeah, we l

Welcome

I'm not staying

Hey, you in a rush?

Yeah

Huh

Hey, Kimishima working out?

Kimishima?

Oh, oh, oh, him
Yeah, not bad

He wasn't easy to find
Just dumb enough not to find us alarming

Just get it over with
I'm busy

What's with the attitude!

What?
I'm bustin' my ass, too

Oh, I'm sorry
I'm always grateful

Fine. then

In that case

What?

It's time I...

Going so soon?

We can't be seen together

Let me know when
you need something

There's an equipment manufacturer
in Niigata, caIled MediCon Industries

Yeah?

I need to access their
confidential progress reports

Can you get those?

I can get 'em

I've heard they once tried
to develop something similar

Huh

I need more details

Sure
As soon as possible

I know that

I'm counting on you

Man, you are an asshole

There we go

Watch your step
All kinds of stuff lying around

Wow, this is...

So?

Yeah

What else do you need?

I worked here 3 years
I can get you anything
