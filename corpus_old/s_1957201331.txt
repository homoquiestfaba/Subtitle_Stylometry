I'm out of here!

Hey! Wait!

Hi!

Let's go!

Come on, man, we'll be
on the road all night!

How come you only hang out with babes?
Let's go.

Jazz, come here, man.

Wine.

Here, look.

You all right?

Hell, what's wrong with you?

What's up with you?

Nothing so far.

Did I hurt you?

It's okay, I'll survive.

You hit well, for a girl.

Yes? I'll take that as a compliment,
if it comes from a macho on a motorcycle.

I like it!

Hey, where are we?
It's a miracle!

What's up?
This engine makes figures.

Are you back?

What's new?

I don't know what he has again.

Maybe thereâ€™s too much weight on him.

Damn, what a mess.

It broke down again.

Again?
Yes, again!

Your big ass won't
get on my engine.

Not even on my engine.
Not with that sweat down his throat.

Very funny.

Pity.

Come on!

Set aside!

Hey, look at his house
that's weird!

Hey, you, wait!

You're late.

Here you go?

What happened to you?
You said you were an hour ago.

And you call that merchandise?

Not worth 500!

I donâ€™t want anything.

I understand. Negotiate.

Mae, Mae!

Come on!

Come on. Damn.
I brought them to 6 but ...

Be serious, Roscoe. This motorcycle
worth more than our house.

Well ...

If you ever need it
someone to fix it, call us!

We are the best in the area.

Can you fix something like that?

If we can? After we finish with the wheels
these, you will not recognize them!

Not me! His.

No, no thought, man!
Don't get your hands on my engine!

Come on, feel at home!
We'll fix it in an instant.

What is he saying?

It says before and after ...

Page 52 ...
Page 52.

That's 55.

Okay, it will be ...

Wait.

Put it here.
Wait, Mae!

You're pressing me again!

Yes!

It's not that far, Nick.
Yes it is.

No way.
Yes.

It's a long way from here.

Come on, Kathy, both of you
we know what will happen.

Couples break up when
I go to different faculties.

Is that what you want?
I didn't say that.

I'm sure there are some girls
who would be glad to hear that.

I am convinced.

Okay, I'll think about it.

I love you.

Yes Yes Yes ...

What the hell is this?

Don't ask me.

What's up?

What are you doing?
Good.

And the horse?

Since when do you care?
Wait a minute, do you know each other?

Not.
Yes.

How are you, Kathy?

Kathy ...

Kat.

Come on, we're wasting his time.

Don't waste my time,
I was just walking.

Then you are wasting our time.

Ok, I got it.
Be careful if you need me,

I'll be there.

Will not have.

We'll see.

Kat ... A few wise words ...

Give up that nothing,
and leaves with a hero.

Here you go ?

See you later, Dick.

It's Nick.

Yes, yes ... Nick.

What was that ?

Forget it, I've already forgotten it.

Where have you been ?

I exchanged a word with Kat.

The girl who was riding!

Did you find out his name?

Not only. I have more than that.

I have a black diary.

That's great. Very great.

Let's take a look at Kat's diary.

Hey, it's live!
Come on, let's sit down.

Come on, sit down.
Kathy, sit next to me.

<i> Thanks, Chuck. </i>

<i> You talked about successful people,
and I have one for you. </i>

Her name is Katherine Winslow,
and you all probably already know it. </i>

<i> Its results are remarkable. </i>

<i> In the last year in high school with an average of 4.0,
1600 points in the academic test ... </i>

What's the answer?

In this case, what is the question?

Hey, it's live!

Be quiet !

<i> I read articles that said it was normal
for teenagers to hate their parents. </i>

<i> But I'm not like that ... </i>

That's because they don't hate you either.

I can't believe I said that.

<i> I think people can
become what they want to become, </i>

<i> as long as they are willing
to work, and that's what I did. </i>

And with a little help.
"From whom?"

<i> My father's! </i>

<i> And what does he think about that? </i>

<i> I don't know, ask him. </i>

<i> Mr. Winslow ... </i>

Turn up...

Immediately.
Now !

<i> ... very proud. </i>

But it's not my merit
for Katy's results. </i>

<i> Me and her mother
We tried to be an example, but ... </i>

I can not believe.

A friend of yours?

Mr. Winslow, what do you expect from Katherine?
after you finish college? </i>

It's not up to me anymore,
she manages on her own. </i>

Thank you, Dad.
"It certainly will be."

And we are proud of her.
I'm Deborah Norris ... </i>

It's over.

It wasn't bad.
You were great!

Come on, I didn't think so.

You won't believe it
whom I saw on TV.

Yes.

I do not know.

Yes.

Dad, on TV
You don't look like a nerd.

Thanks, Tommy, that makes it easier.

Hello?

We are proud of you.

Hello!

Hello!

And Charlie ...

Yes, she's even prettier in reality.

By the way, Charlie,
did you call earlier?

It's not Alright.

Thank you again.

What is it, Dad?

Charlie wanted to know why Thrace
He can't look more like you.

Interesting, because Traci believes
I should look more like her.

It's not possible !
Sure.

Her old man doesn't believe that.

Your old man wants to eat.
What do you say about this ?

Nick, are you having dinner with us tonight?

I can't, I promised my parents.

Maybe another time.
Yes, definitely.

"What about my walk?"
Next time, Tommy. I promise.

You always promise.

You're a sucker.

Are we going to Sugar Shack tonight?

Is that a change?

You smile when you say that.
That's what I do.

Good.

Am I coming to pick you up at 8?

Good.
Good.

Goodbye, Mrs. and Mr. Winslow.
Goodbye, Nick.

My agenda is gone.

Do not look at me.

Tommy, and seriously,
I have all the data there.

Think about what you did today
and you'll find out where you left it.

Good.

I know I had it when I went to
service, because I put my check in it.

Then I went straight to Nick's house
and I didn't touch her there ...

Remain silent.

Nothing happened in the meantime,
because Nick brought me straight home.

I withdraw my words.
I know exactly where he is.

And I know exactly how to get it back.

You're in those lessons, V.
And serious.

The sum of the squares of the legs is equal
with the square of the hypotenuse.

What am I doing there?

So far, I'm coming out.

Roscoe, I can't believe it.

Hi, where's my engine?

He really is a genius.

Where's my engine?
How long have you been here?

Where's my engine?

Shall we stay?

You are welcome to stay
as long as you want.

Where's my engine?

What's with you ?
It's right here in front of your eyes.

Don't you see him?
Is that his engine?

Do you think it's funny?

Isn't that great?
"You tore him to pieces."

Yes, as I always said. Can not
Repair something if you don't disassemble it.

Great philosophy,
but can you fix it quickly?

That's exactly what I want to do.

And when is that?

Well ... I don't know, maybe tomorrow ...

Tomorrow?

Morrisey, I found it.

Did you find ?
Do you know the name of this place?

Yes I am sure.

I hope it's as you say.

I can't wait to get there
I'm starving. I'm getting french fries ...

You're thinking of something else
apart from food?

Did you think that would happen?

Not. And now that it's happened, I want to
to be sure that the job will be done well.

So let's go.
Come on!

We are all very impressed here,
but let's leave it for today.

He can find out which side ...

Who? him ? No, that's my job.
How do you think we're fixing something here?

Roscoe, stop.

I left here.

Where are you going ?

Across the corner.

What the ?

What are you doing lady ?

I can help you ?
I'm looking for Kat.

We don't have a cat (cat).

Kathy, your daughter

Do you want to see her?

Tommy, go inside.

What are you doing, trickster?

I am sorry,
Kathy isn't here right now.

You don't know where he is?
I am not sorry.

I know.
The Sugar Shack.

It's a club.
She's there with Nick, her boyfriend.

Sugar Shack.
I'm going to check.

Do you know where he is?
Tommy!

If not, I can show you.
Tommy, go inside.

See you.
Okay, partner.

I enjoyed
let me know you, madam.

Hey!
Hey and you.

Do you know where Sugar Shack is?
Sugar Shack?

Why ?
Because I want to know.

Who was it, darling?

A boy was looking for Kathy.

Who?
I don't know, I didn't ask.

Do you see that street over there? Go on the street
That, until you pass a large building ...

Leave him alone.
Listen.

You have to go about 4-5 blocks,
and then go on the bridge ...

Then around the corner,
You found Sugar Shack.

The spoiled ...

Go away !

They are good.
You do not want ?

Let's go.

"Do you know you're disgusting?"
I love you too.

We return in the evening to pay him a visit.

You will probably show up
in a soap opera series.

You were great.

Why don't you try dancing?

You try.
I have something else to do.

I know what I'm going to do.

Jazz, wait for me too.

This is a trick for
get to Nick ...

Are we having fun, or what?

Yes.
Aren't we drinking something?

I want a diet cola.

Diet cola, be serious, Kathy.

Nick, be serious.
Drive.

I'm a big boy,
and I'm still thirsty.

I like the band, they are great.

Kathy, do you want to dance?

You dance, or do your homework
in your head all night?

I'm not finished.

Jimmy.

The young officer, Jim.

Long time no see.

For about 20 years.

But you look great.

Doesn't it look great?

I think you did
One mistake, gentlemen.

My name is Gordon Winslow.

Now excuse me ...
Jim ...

The camera really doesn't put you off
in a better light.

But certainly
Your daughter looks good.

Sara ...
Sara Louis, are you?

It looks great, doesn't it?

Yes. Look great.
Good.

Okay, Jim?

Okay, what do you want?

What we want is some money.

About 500,000, to be more precise.

James, Jim, Jimmy, Jimbo. You got it
part. We want ours too.

What time ?

What time ? Because you know what?
You have until tomorrow to bring the money.

Hey V., look.

Man, I have an idea.
Come on, D.!

<i> I'm going to release some funky lyrics,
which sounds like this ... </i>

It's not what you say it's how you say it

Gimmie a microphone

on stage, I display it

Playin' me right, or you get played out

like polka-dots, and people will shout

dirt words, cause your a nerd

I'm first to 3rd, it's absurd
to think that' you've heard

better rhymes than these

I'm bringing soccer
MC, down to their knees

Tease your thoughts,
like a feather to a toe

Althought the beast is
slow, my grooves still flow

My rhymes are Sofa-Hot, it makes your heart dance

Melodic tones move your mind to a quick trance

Everytime I rhyme I find the audience is mine

Over every line

Sparkle like a gem with a golden voice

Why do they love you man?

I'm the people's choice

Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself

I wanna thank you, uh

Just thank you, baby

I wanna thank you, for lettin' me, be myself

I wanna thank you, uh

Just thank you, baby

Let's swing it

Commin outta my ears

The competition?

In tears!

Dance moves?

By the dozen

Battles?

Pasted up, 'cause I love 'em

Settin' up suckers like pins on a bowling ball

and you're all gonna fall

you won't hit, it's a
bottomless pit of rhymes

Coming straight from
the mind of a genius

And I can't be modest

When I make a dirty bet I keep it like I promised son

Shake like a leaf when you see me coming in

And frankly, you're better off runnin'... fast

And don't look back whack

Go take a nap

Get off the crack jack

Crowds move by the sound of my golden voice

Why do they love you man?

I'm the people's choice

Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself

I wanna thank you, baby

I'm the people's choice

You don't look bad.

Neither do you.

What ?

I was thinking.

What ?
To you and my agenda.

Agenda?

You have 24 hours to return it to me, as
You found it. Sorry, the way you stole it.

Otherwise, I'll call the police.

If that's all you want,
why did you dance with me

Let me show you I can.

What are you doing ?

You made me laugh enough for one night.

I hope you are happy. You made me
laughing in front of friends.

I am sorry,
it was not intentional.

But what was your intention?

I don't understand, at first you didn't want to go out,
and now, you're behaving like a slut ...

I talk with you !

You act like that bitch,
what is her name ...

And you don't drink, so that's it
You can't use it as an excuse, can you?

I'm willing to forgive you for that.

Hey, I said I'm willing
I forgive you for that.

Good ?

I forgot.

Nick, no!

I said no !

That's all you tell me
Lately.

Maybe it means something.

Maybe you're looking for a fat man,
or for that weird inside.

Do you know anything, Nick?
You really are an idiot.

Get in the car, Kathy!

I said get in the car!
Hey, I'm talking to you.

Come on, climb!
Hurry up !

What was that ?

Who were those?

I don't know, you bastards.

I think so.

I have to go.
So fast ?

So, what are you doing tomorrow?

I don't know what to do tomorrow, man.

What are we doing ?
I'm waiting.

Me ?
My agenda!

Good night.

Melted again!

Hi.
Hi.

Who was that?

It was the boy who brought me home.

Who is ?
What's his name ?

I do not know.
You do not know ?

No

What ?

What happens ?
Nothing, Kathy.

I recommend you in the future
don't go with strangers anymore.

Dad, if you'll let me explain ...

No need to explain.
Not to be repeated.

Good.

Thank you.
Good night dear.

Good night.

Don't worry, Kathy,
everything is alright.

"What's the matter, boys?"
Look who's here!

We play baseball on your motorcycle.

It's not mine, it's Sir D.'s.

Who is Sir D.?

My companion.

Take this, comrade!

See you later, sucker.

We don't want to wake mom and dad.

What are you doing here ?

You called me.

Seriously ?

Do not you remember ?

Just like I found it ...

Sorry, how I stole it!

So ...

Who is Monique?

Who?

You do not know ?
You have her phone number.

And that's you, isn't it?
John Van Owen.

Where from...
Give me that !

Where did you get that from ?
It slipped out of your pocket.

So, is it in the area?
Shall we call her?

No, wait, don't tell me.
She's your sister, isn't she?

This was your agenda,
and now you're taking things from me?

I made sure I got it
agenda back.

We're even.

Yes, we'll see.

Well

Well?

See you later.

See you now.

See you now ...

You can't stay here,
I need to change.

Change ...

Do you think I won't do it?

Kathy, my mother said ...

Tommy, get out of here!

You came back !
What's up buddy ?

Are you her new friend?

Tommy, get out of here!

Is the motorcycle outside yours?
Tommy!

Yes, have you ever been with one?
Not.

I'm going to go ...

Yes ? When?
Soon.

After you finish having sex?

Tommy, get out!
That's not funny !

Promise?
I promise.

Kat, if you need to
by me, I will be out ...

Damn !

Come on. Put your foot in here.

Hands, right here

How long have you lived here?
What is your occupation ?

Say it.
No, you say.

Good. How long
do you live here

Since I was born, why?

How is it ?

What do you mean?

You know, have parents
and stuff like that ...

A brother ... All this ...
It's nice.

You know you can count on them.

I presume.

What did you want to ask me ?
Leave it.

"Really, what did you want to ask me?"
Leave it.

Does not matter.

Where are you from ?

From around the area.

From the area?
Yes.

Don't say too much.

Not ?
Not.

It doesn't matter where you are from,
but where are you now.

And now, I'm with you, Kat.

Tell me ...
What the ?

How are you having fun around here, student?

Or are you too busy for that?

Not.

I don't think it's bad
to work hard.

Imagine.

What's important to you?

Be honest with yourself,
and disobey others.

If you live life for someone else,
It means you don't live.

This is the reality.

Imagine!
Imagine ...

Sometimes I want to do something wild,
because I never did.

Why don't you?

After you.

Well, thanks.

For what ?
For all.

What is this for?

To know the difference
between me and Monique.

I know the difference between
you and the rest.

Seriously ?
Yes.

Katherine ...
Father...

I haven't heard from you all day.
Your mother was scared.

I'm sorry, I didn't know.

You did not think !

You could at least give a call.

He couldn't, he was with me.
There were no telephones in the area.

Where have you been ?

It was on my engine,
we took a walk.

Yes I know.
I met his two friends.

What the ?

Who ?

Don't act like you don't know about
what is it about. I saw you last night.

Go away
and leave my face alone.

But Dad, you don't understand.

No, miss,
you do not understand.

Nick arrived at the hospital last night.
Looks like your friend put him in there.

Did you do that?

Yes. The sucker wanted to play baseball
with my comrade's engine.

Get in.
I'll take care of that.

But Dad ..

Inside! Now.

See you tomorrow, Kat.

I don't want you to approach her anymore,
tomorrow or another day.

Isn't that her decision?

Get the hell out of here.

He needs to know what's going on.

We need to tell him.
"What can we tell him?"

The truth.

Tell me, how do I do?

Concrete.

I had to tell you this
for a long time.

My real name
it's not Winslow.

It's Hacket.

James Anthony Hacket.
Jimmy.

Your mother's name is Sara.

We had just gotten married.

I was a cop, a novice.

And my partner, Walsh,
he wasn't a brain guy.

I guess it was me.
I was right, and Walsh, no.

So those in Home Affairs
they decided to do something about it.

I did what I thought was right.
Two more police officers were charged with Walsh.

They made some threats ...
Your mother was pregnant.

And when we were offered to join the program
for the protection of witnesses, I accepted.

In a week, I became
Gordon and Grace Winslow.

I had birth certificates,
college diplomas ...

I came here a little
after that you were born.

And that was his end
Jimmy and Sara Hacket, so far.

Last night...

I saw my friend
yours with two men.

The other two cops.
They saw me on TV.

What will they do?

They said to give them the money
I've kept them all these years.

What will happen ?

We can't be yet
than caring.

Especially with strangers.

He's a bad man, Kathy.
Stay away from him.

It's not what you think.

How do you know ?

Know. If you knew him,
You know that too.

That's what I want to say. I don't know him,
and you don't know him either.

I know you, Dad.

But that means I can
did he trust you

You lied to me all my life!

I didn't lie to you, I protected you.

Everything I did, good or bad,
I did it for you.

Can you say the same about him?

It's not fair.
You know.

I love you, Katherine.

I love you so much.

I gave up my life,
to give you a new one.

Father...

Are you sure about Johnny?

I want you to stay away from him.

Not only for your own good, but also for
the good of your brother, of your mother, and of mine.

What are you doing ?

I was in the area, and I thought
that maybe you want me to take you.

I have someone to go with.
Thank you.

Are you feeling alright ?
Yes.

Okay, see you tonight.
Not.

Not ?

Not. Not tonight,
not tomorrow, not at all, okay?

I understand.

You're too busy
What do you have to do with it, right?

Maybe so, and maybe I did
a good reason to do so.

I bet someone gave it to you
this motivation.

Tell me one thing ...

Who are you honest with now?

Sometimes I feel like I know you ...

But how can you know a person
which you just met?

You make me feel special, but from where
I know you don't do that to all the girls?

How do I know this isn't just?
Another town, and I'm another Monique.

Are you talking, or your father?

I.

I do not know.

Know something ?
You really don't know.

You don't know me at all.

Well ... You did it this time.

I don't know if Nick
he will get you back.

You could at least visit him at the hospital.

Or call him.
Who do you think You Are ?

Anyway, I don't think it's too late,
if she agrees.

You're kidding ? Do you think she forgives her,
after humiliating him like that?

No way.

Tell him how sorry you are
and how much you love him.

Johnny?

Johnny!

What do you think ?

You look like the world!

Thanks, I did it.

Shown.

What's up ?

"You mean Kathy?"
So.

Every time I talk about
you, he tells me to shut up.

And to me at school, when it happens
So, it means that the girl likes you.

Yes ?

She thinks I'm a little small,
but I managed to get here.

I was thinking maybe we could take a tour ...

You promised me, remember?

Yes. But not now, kid,
I'm a little busy, you know?

Let's go !
Yes !

Alright!

Come on, put it on!
I understand.

All right.
Help me a little.

She has nothing, Mae.
Roscoe, listen to me!

That piece won't fit in here.
Yes, it fits, Mae.

Thanks, Johnny, it was concrete!

Do you want to see my room?

I do not know...

It's fine. Kathy has to come
take me later from training.

Yes ? Should you be there?

I do not care. It's her fault that
I snuck in to come to you.

It's fine.
She does what her father tells her.

Yes.
See you.

Hey, Tommy, I'm gone.

All ?

Like yesterday.

See you later, buddy!

So what will we ...
Look what we have here?

What are you doing here ?
What you want ?

Why aren't you training?

What are you doing here, boy?

We are friends with your father.
We came to get some important documents.

Asa e. Act.

I do not know you.
I'll call the police.

You don't want to do this.
Dial 911!

9-1-1.

Don't come near!

I can locate these calls.
I saw it in "America's Most Wanted"!

Yes ? You saw the show
when did i show up

Help !

Back!
Come here, boy!

I'll catch you!

Stay away!

Don't come near me!

You're mine, baby.

Where did you think you were running, buddy?

Remain silent !
Help !

Help !
Help !

Shut up, you idiot!

Tommy?

I don't think you heard right.
We're leaving!

All.
I have ears, let's go.

Beat the plains.

You really fell in love.

Are we leaving or not?

Not until you say goodbye.

But I know you made me.

No way.
Not.

It's true. You think we want to see you
always wondering, what would have happened?

No, man.
You've already gone too far.

What are you doing, Kathy?

Nothing.
I was thinking.

Where's Tommy?

I thought he was with you.

Kathy, I asked you to go
after him at training.

I was, but he wasn't there,
and I thought he was with you.

Kathy, did you check into his room?

No but...

It's not here.
What the ?

It's like I told you
don't come here anymore.

I need to talk to Kat.

It's not here.

It's behind you.

Do you want to talk or not?

I understand.
You still do what my father says, don't you?

This is for you.

What is it ?

It's a tape.

<i> Hi, Mom, Dad and Kathy. </i>

<i> I recorded this
box to tell you </i>

<i> how much fun we have together
with my new friends. </i>

<i> They told me a lot about you, Dad, </i>

<i> and I don't think you behaved
right with them. </i>

<i> So I'll stay here until you do. </i>

<i> If you change your mind in the next
24 hours, I'll be home. </i>

<i> If not, no. </i>

So do what you have to do,
and everything will be fine. </i>

I told you he was involved, too.

Dad, it has nothing to do with this.

God, Kathy, you really believe it
Did he come to see you?

He came to bring us this tape.

I'll call the police.
Not !

These young people are on this street,
there must be something there.

Hi, Mr. Winslow.
What are you doing ?

What ?
What I said ?

Something happened to Tommy.

Tommy?
I just saw him.

Where?
They were going downtown.

Where in the center?

You were the mall ...
What do you call it on the street?

Growstreet ...
They were there.

Who?

Tommy and the guy from Sugar Shack.

It seemed to me that something was wrong,
Tommy looked scared.

You're wrong.
You are all wrong!

I know he has nothing to do with this.

How can you know for sure?

I trust him, Dad.

What does that mean?

He went too far.
I'll call the police.

Father...

We must be careful.

They'll do something.
I can not take it anymore !

Trust him, great!

It's an emergency, please!

Not !

Johnny, we need to talk!

We have to talk.

You need a psychiatrist.

Please listen to this.

What is this ?

My brother was abducted.

<i> So I'll stay here until then ... </i>

<i> If you change your mind in the next ones
24 hours, I'll be home. </i>

<i> If not, no. </i>

So do what you have to do,
and everything will be fine. </i>

Then no

We have to hurry.

Then no

That sound ...
I know that sound.

What sound?
Where is it heard?

Do you hear him?

Then no

That beating ...

You took me there, I was ...

On the job site!
Yes.

Where am I ?

Drive!

Where am I ?

Around here !
Where am I ?

Is he here somewhere?

I don't know, it can be anywhere!

Hey, fool, look at this.

Here's what we have here.

The Martians landed.

They're cute.
They have beautiful motorcycles ...

Take that thing out of my eyes.

You are ours.

Just because we can't hear them,
It doesn't mean I'm not here.

Forget it.
Let's go.

Who is the Martian leader?
Is he your leader too?

You're not even close.

You are ours.

Leaves...
And they're gone!

You know, kid, if your father
don't give in,

you will get a picture
on a can of milk.

Do you know what that means?

It means that my friend here,
the cute one, if he doesn't get what he wants,

he gets very angry.

I'm getting very angry!
Shut up !

After the whole thing is over
That, I will buy a house.

One exactly like this.

What was that ?
What the ?

To stay.

What the ?
You're confused, I don't hear anything.

I told you, officer,
my nephew is gone.

Do you have any idea where he is?

Back to Harward, where else?

That's right, he has an exam
important in chemistry, tomorrow.

That's his specialty, chemistry.

And a little and modern dance.

If it sounds like boarding school ...

What the hell ?

Hi, what are you doing?

Tommy! You all right ?

Mom, calm down!

Everyone is looking at us!

God, they made you
this hair?

No, I did it!

It's bad, isn't it?

I'll be there in a moment.

I didn't hurt anything, Mom.

Thank you.

It does not matter anymore.

See you later.

Not too late.
Good.

Do you know I left here?

I thought we were leaving!

What are you going to do, student?

I don't know, college doesn't start
tonight, smart!

Then let's go.

Kathy.

Do you know what you're doing?

I hope not.

I hope you like being loved
a motorcyclist,

because you will never see me again
on me or my car.

Imagine.

Hold on tight.
Where are we going?

I forgot something...
