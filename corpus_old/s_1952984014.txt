â€“Mom?
â€“I am here.

Mom!

You forgot that.

Are you sure
this is the right thing?

It feels like it'd be better
if we thought about it.

â€“Yeah, I do.
â€“We don't have any other option.

Okay.

If I get off early
I can pick you up.

It don't matter,
I will take a bus.

Don't worry.

â€“Have a good day.
â€“You too, Mom.

â€“How you doing?
â€“I don't know.

How we're paying
for all of this?

â€“We put up the house.
â€“I knew it.

It's because of you
I am still alive.

We decided it together.

What did you all
decide together?

To live on the street?

For 18 yearsâ€¦

your mother and I have been
paying on that houseâ€¦

just to fuck it all up.

Don't say that, Dad.

I am leaving, babe.

You got what
you have been waiting for?

Yeah, I got it.

Would it be right?

That's not your concern.

But if I make it back,
I going to make so much moneyâ€¦

you going to love me again.

When I turned five years old,
I got a little kitten.

It was so cute I took
it to bed with me every night.

I want a little lambâ€¦

and I will take it to bed
with me at night.

People don't keep sheep inside.

â€“I will.
â€“Didn't you hear?

We don't keep sheep inside
and we don't take them to bed.

My little lamb has to be
all white with black ears.

Why black ears?

So I won't get him mixed up
with the other sheep.

I will be able to recognize him.

Very clever.

Thanks, Mom.

Two million dollars, Jasper.

I get back $3 million in 3 days.

You said $2.5.

â€“I'll take it.
â€“You can count it.

I'm sorry to say, but
he'll need another operation.

Unfortunately
we can't always foreseeâ€¦

consequences
in this type of cases.

How much is this operation
gonna cost?

I assume it would be so much
as the past procedure.

All right.

Thank you Doctor.

So what's thisjob about, man?
Dope?

No. Nothing like that.

Listen, I am broke.
I am on the street.

Hey.

I haven't forgotten what you did
for me when I was away.

If this thing works out.
I will set you up. I promise.

â€“How long exactly will it take?
â€“One day.

Jesus. You make
all that cash in one day?

If I make it.

But you made it the last time.

That was last time.

As long as my luck doesn't
run out, you can count on me.

Do you still live at 135,
Kissam Avenue, Talbot Ohio?

Yeah.

Okay Vincent, I think
that about does it. Thank you.

I'm here to pick up a package
for William Harrison.

â€“ID please.
â€“Sure.

There is a train ticket
for New Yorkâ€¦

and the CPS receipt
for pick-up.

We know
about the envelopeâ€¦

we opened it
before your husband.

And?

There was no CPS receipt
in the envelope.

That's your problem.
I got enough for my own.

Okay.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Here it is. Harrison.
Picked up by Al Vincent Farrow.

Yeah, it's him.

What do you think?
How do I look?

You're very handsome.

They're gonna love you.

<i>â€“Hello?
â€“Mr Harrison?</i>

Yeah.

<i>Tomorrow at noonâ€¦</i>

<i>go to the PostNet store
by Grand Central.</i>

<i>â€“Hang on.
â€“200 West, 39th Street.</i>

Okay.

<i>With the key you found
with the cell phoneâ€¦</i>

<i>you'll open box 253.</i>

<i>Inside you'll find another train
ticket and more instructions.</i>

<i>The ticket is for Macomb, but
you'll get off one stop before.</i>

<i>One stop before.</i>

Ticket, please.

He's getting off at Macomb.

â€“What time do we arrive?
â€“Train gets in at 3:10.

Can I help you
with anything else?

No. Thank you.

â€“You free?
â€“Yeah, get in.

That'll be $77.

â€“Keep the change.
â€“Wow! Thank you.

Give me your phone.

Get in the car.

I brought him down here
and that's it. And I left.

You didn't see
anything else unusual?

No.

â€“Which number is he?
â€“Thirteen.

Stay in the middle
of the carpet.

Take your clothes off.

Take off the rest.

Get dressed.

Follow me.

Have a seat.

Who's that?

I can explain.

â€“I knowâ€¦
â€“Shut up!

Go get Jack.

You're probably wonderingâ€¦

what I'm doing here.
â€“Quiet!

Two million.

I'll bet $700Â·000 on number six.

What's going on?

Who is he?

The guy I picked up
at the intersection.

He's not who I was expecting.

â€“Well, he had the number.
â€“Harrison's dead.

â€“What are you talking about?
â€“He OD'd.

And who the fuck are you?

I'm an electrician.
I was working on his house.

â€“Did he tell you about this?
â€“No, I overheard him talking.

He was waiting for a letter
and it could be a lot of money.

I took it
and followed the instructions.

â€“Do you know what this is about?
â€“No.

No, I have no idea.

Follow me.

Do you think the cops sent him?

Maybe we should get out now.

If we leave
and the cops show upâ€¦

the others will think
we ratted.

We'd be dead men.

â€“Where you going?
â€“I should go talk to them.

Excuse me, gentlemen.

If it's a problemâ€¦

me being here, thenâ€¦

then I think I should leave.
I'll leave.

It's too late.

â€“Where are they?
â€“They're in there.

Is your man here?

Yes, he's here.
Everything's okay.

We start in a half hour.

We'll be right down.

â€“What if I don't want me here?
â€“You have to play now.

I don't know
what that means, butâ€¦

You'll find out.

Six hundred thousand
on number thirteen.

Good luck.

Attention! The first round
is about to begin!

You can have it.

I'm asking the guards to
please distribute the bullets.

One bullet to each player.

Hansâ€¦

we are born only once
and we die only once.

You must be philosophical, huh?

You are the descendant
of the great Schopenhauer.

I ask all the gamblers
To back up a little.

Please, gentlemen, back up.
Back up.

Thank you gentlemen.

Please, boss, have a seat.

Players!

Load your bullets
into their cylinders!

What going on, thirteen?

Do you have a problem,
number thirteen?

Watch out.

No, no one get up into the ring!

I ask you to step down
immediately!

He doesn't know how
to load his gun. Give it here.

Pay attention.
Open it like this.

Round.

All right! Enough!

Take your places!

Raise your weapons!

Higher!

Spin your cylinders!

More, more, keep it up!

Stop!

Aim!

Cock your hammers!

Number thirteen,
no turning around!

Players, all eyes on the bulb!

When the bulb lights up,
you shoot!

Number thirteen did not shoot!

Mr Joe Gerber, if your man
does not shoot, we will!

What the fuck are you doing?
Pull the trigger!

â€“Shoot! Shoot, son of a bitch!
â€“I'm going to count to three!

â€“Shoot!
â€“Shoot!

Two!

Everyone out of the ring!

Are you done
with your little drama?

How much are they paying you
to watch my ass?

What the fuck is it to you?

I'll give you fifty times more
what they're giving youâ€¦

if you let me
get out of here.

If you got that money,
why did you come here?

Do you think I waltzed
through the fucking door?

â€“What's going on, man?
â€“Get dressed, fucker!

<i>Gringo, gringo.
Where are you going, gringo?</i>

Hi, boss. Very nice to see you.

It must be really importantâ€¦

ifyou want to talk
this late.

Put him in the box.

Wait. What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

Damn it! Get me the fuck
outta here! God damn!

Unshackle his legs.

Are you in charge here?

You gonna tell me
what's going on?

I've been in this goddamn box
for two and a half days!

What's going on.
What do you want?

Give him a shower, a change
of clothes. Something fresh.

What are youâ€¦?

â€“And his stuff?
â€“What are you talking about?

Give it to him.

I can't do nothing foryou,
don't even think about it.

â€“It's not possible.
â€“Wait a minute.

Come on, come here.
Come here, man.

My man is out.
I wanna bet on yours.

Sure. I take
50 points off the top.

â€“You want some morphine?
â€“No.

â€“They all do it.
â€“I said no!

You lost your player,
didn't you?

Son of a bitch.

Sure you're betting
on the right man?

Don't worry about him,
he has what he needs.

I don't know what you deal
with this guy is, butâ€¦

I can do you one better.
60/40.

Sixty for you,
forty for me.

But you have to bet
at least $400Â·000.

The player number six
has the most experience.

â€“You know who I'm talking about?
â€“I know your player.

You made your offer,
I just made mine.

Let this gentleman
make up his own mind.

Sixty-forty it is.

Place your bets, gentlemen.

Your brother would fare better
if family visited more often.

A year's a long time
for someone in his condition.

I'm the only family
Ronald Lynn has.

I try to get down here
as often as I can.

To skip his medication,
even for a dayâ€¦

could be serious.
â€“Yes, ma'am.

Sign here and here
for Ronald Lynn's release.

Your brother's here. He came
to get you. You have to go.

â€“Did they take care of you?
â€“Yeah.

â€“Good.
â€“This is your new car?

Yeah. You like it?

â€“Yeah.
â€“Come on, let's go.

On your feet!

Move it! Let's go!

Now!

I said move it! Let's go!

Get him on his feet, now!
You! Get him on his feet!

On your feet, gentlemen!
On your feet!

Two bullets in each weapon!
Two bullets!

Players, load your bullets
into their cylinders!

Two bullets!

Higher!

Spin your cylinders!

Keep it up!

Stop!

Aim!

Cock your hammers!

Don't look me in the eye.

â€“Damn!
â€“Out of the ring!

Collect the weapons! Now!

You're pretty lucky.

The bullet is in the chamber,
he didn't have time to shoot.

Nice. One more round
like that and we're through.

Hans.

Hans.

Bring him to me.

Doctor to the ring!

He cannot continue.

Hold on! Is this a fucking
game or a slaughterhouse?

My player didn't die
in the game. He's still alive.

â€“What the hell was that?
â€“You know the rules, Mr Taylor.

Hans.

Hans.

When you start something, you
must stay with it until the end.

Nobody forced you to do this.

You are two for two.

You are great. You are great!

Listen.

About two years ago,
me and my boys, we hit thisâ€¦

armored car in Mexico.

My two partners,
they got blown away.

Had time to get rid of the truck
and hid the money.

If you had that money,
why are you out of prison?

You should've been
a gold mine for them.

Damn.

I didn't talk, okay?

If I would've talked,
they would've smoked my assâ€¦

and take the goddamn money.

They'll blow both our brains out
before we got out.

You got a better chance
of surviving in the ring.

I got a lot of fucking money.

I'm sorry,
I can't do that for you.

Give me something to write with.

â€“You sleep okay?
â€“Yeah.

â€“I feel much better now.
â€“Did you take your medication?

No.

Doctor says you're not
supposed to skip a dose.

Fuck her. I feel much better
without it anyway.

Tails. Always fucking tails,
you know.

My luck's fucked.

No, we're gonna make it. Don't
pay attention to that shit.

How much did we win
for the first 2 rounds?

$2.9 million.

We'll be standing behind
player 13.

I'd like to bet the $2.9â€¦

plus an additional $1.2.

I hate that fucking number.

Calm down.

â€“Just let it go.
â€“Calm down a little bit.

Forget about it.

He's shot two already.

He shoots three,
you get a bonus.

That would be wonderful.

â€“How much do I have?
â€“$1.1 million.

Listen, man.

I got all the detailsâ€¦

of where I buried the money
on this map here.

Listen to me, man.

I got a son.
He's doing some time.

He's got another, I don't
know, 18 months to go, soâ€¦

if anything happens to meâ€¦

and I don't make it
out of hereâ€¦

I want you to take this note
outta my pocketâ€¦

go get that money
and split it with him.

We got a deal?

Okay, you got it.

Number six.

Number three.

Eleven.

You can take him now.

You're going down.

What the fuck do you want?

All right, enough!

Mr Schlondoff, why isn't
your player in the ring?

â€“He must step up immediately!
â€“He'll be there, he'll be there.

The third round
is about to begin!

What's wrong?

Just a little case of the runs.

Get him up there.

Come on.

Give him his gun.

For the third roundâ€¦

I will ask the guards
to distributeâ€¦

three bullets to each player.
Three bullets!

Sir, please.

Can I please have
a chair for my player?

He's not feeling too well.

The guy wants a chair
for number three.

He's having
a hard time standing.

Get him a chair.

Thank you.

Raise your weapons!

Spin your cylinders!

More!

Stop!

Aim!

Cock your hammers!

Eyes on the bulb!

Out of the ring!

Collect the weapons!

Gentlemen, we are at the last
stage of our game.

The duel. On the table
there are five balls.

Three white, two black.

The black will designate
the duelists.

I will call the gamblers
representing numbers sixâ€¦

nine, thirteen,
seventeen and three.

I will ask that
you unwrap the ballsâ€¦

above your heads
so that everyone can see.

Gentlemen, good luck.

â€“Gentlemen, place your bets.
â€“Okay, wait, wait!

I'm not accepting any offers
under eighty-five percent.

Nothing less than $300Â·000.

Two million dollars.

Okay, slowly, slowly.

Hey, the game is over for you.

You're selected for the draw.

You mean I can go?

Nobody leaves
until the game is over.

After the duel.

Collect your money
and you're free to go.

â€“They will pay me money?
â€“Yeah.

Mr Gerber.

I would like to bet on your boy.

Our player has no experienceâ€¦

at this stage of the game,
it's important.

â€“How much do you want?
â€“I want eighty percent.

No, no, no, that's too much.

The two brothers are not
offering much better.

We're a long shot at 5 to 1.
You'd make more money.

Everyone is betting on them.

Yes.

All right.

We will do business.

Hey! Let him go!

What the fuck are you doing?
Nobody touches the survivors.

â€“Nobody!
â€“Fuck.

Hey, man.

You're looking for this?

All that money you thought
you'd be holding on to?

All that money?

Only thing you'd be
holding on to, Jimmyâ€¦

would have been your dick.

Okay, son?

Happy trails, partner.

What's going on between you?

I just want to get
the fuck out of here.

Get dressed and come get
your money. You're free to go.

<i>Happy trails to you.</i>

<i>Happy trails to you.</i>

It's almost over, Ronald Lynn.

If this works out well,
Jasperâ€¦

I want my fucking share.

Of course.

But there's not a lot of people
batting on us.

I don't think
we're gonna make much.

Shut your fucking mouth, cunt!
Shut your fucking mouth!

I fucking know you.

I know you.

Mommy and Daddy left you enough
money to look after me.

And you stucked me
in that fucking hospital.

That hospital costs me a lot.

You've earnt more money
out of meâ€¦

playing this fucking game
these past years.

â€“And you're a fucking waster.
â€“That's horseshit.

I ain't going back to Centerdale
and I want my fucking money.

Against the wall.

Against the wall.

â€“Shit.
â€“What?

Trigger is too fucking tight.
It's too big.

They're all the same.

Thirteen.

Six.

One.

Two.

Three.

â€“Good for you?
â€“Okay.

Players to the center
of the ring!

Raise your weapons!

Spin your cylinders!

Stop!

Aim!

Cock your hammers!

Eyes on the bulb!

Attention, gentlemen!
The duel will continue!

I will ask for an additional
bullet in each cylinder!

One, two, threeâ€¦

four.

One, two threeâ€¦

fourth bullet.

Players, please step forward!

Raise your weapons!

Spin your cylinders!

More!

Stop!

Aim!

Cock your hammers!

When the bulb lights up,
you shoot!

Gentlemen, the game is over!

It's finished!

And the winner
is number thirteen!

Congratulations, thirteen!
Congratulations!

Fuck! Fuck! Fuckers!

Well done, young man.

Well done.

Have a seat.

Six.

Seven.

Eight.

Nine.

Ten.

Congratulations.

One million, eight hundred
and fifty thousand dollars.

Do you realize
how lucky you are?

Your opponent won
his last three duels.

â€“Are you satisfied?
â€“Yes.

If you want,
we can give you a ride.

Where?

It doesn't matter.

We can drop you off at
the nearest train stationâ€¦

if you like.
â€“Yeah.

I'll get my things
and meet you downstairs.

Would you like a drink?

No, thank you.

Couldn't find him.

Get in the car.

Your total is gonna be $38.

Thank you.

Hi.

Officer Steller?

This is Claudio,
the cab driver from yesterday.

Yeah.

No, I just saw your guy.
Yeah, at the station.

No, he's here now.

That's him right there.

â€“He's on your side.
â€“That's your guy.

Blue jacket, seated.

Excuse me, sir.
Come with us please.

You want him uncuffed?

Uncuff him.

Leave us alone. Thank you.

Where did you hide the money?

What the hell
are you talking about?

Sit down.

I said sit down.

You're not under arrest,
Vincentâ€¦

and won't be if you tell me
everything that went on there.

â€“I never made it.
â€“Don't bullshit me.

I'm telling the truth.

Why did they pick you upâ€¦

if they were looking
for Harrison?

The driver didn't know Harrison.

When he pulled up,
I flashed him the signal.

The signal?

A piece of corkboard
with a number.

â€“Where did he drop you?
â€“Somewhere in the forest.

What happened?

When I got there, two guys
were waiting in a car.

When they saw me,
I knew I was screwed.

I told them
Harrison was deadâ€¦

that I was willing
to take his place.

But they didn't go for it.

Either they didn't believe me
or whateverâ€¦

but they
didn't want me there.

I saw one of them had a gun.

When he reached for it,
I reacted.

â€“I ran and just kept running.
â€“Did they chase you?

They chased me.
They shot at me.

But I just kept running.

I ran so hard I lost
the heels of my shoes.

If you saw them again, would you
be able to identify them?

Of course.

Could you take me
to that place in the forest?

I was in a panic.

I'd been running for hours,
it was dark.

How the fuck do you expect me
to remember where I was?

But if we took you
to that intersectionâ€¦

you'd get
your bearings, right?

The driver blindfolded me.

â€“You're lying.
â€“I'm telling the truth.

Put your boots back on.

Can I go now?

Twenty-two dollars, please.

<i>â€“Mom?
â€“Vince.</i>

<i>How's Dad? How's everything?</i>

<i>Everything's the same.
He was wondering about you.</i>

What happened?
Did everything go okay?

Listen, Mom, I sent
some money on the mail.

Certified mail.

<i>â€“Money?
â€“A lot of money.</i>

If you're not home,
have Clara wait for it, okay?

<i>What do you mean, money?
From where?</i>

I'll explain later, just
make sure somebody's home.

You're scaring me, Vincent.
Are you in trouble?

<i>No, everything's fine.</i>

Just make sure somebody's
home tomorrow, okay?

<i>Vincent, please tell me
what's going on.</i>

I love you.

$18.25.

How much for the lamb?

â€“It's not for sale.
â€“I'll give you $100 for it.

â€“For the lamb?
â€“Yeah.

It's snowing.

Yeah.

Going far?

I'm going home.

Where?

Ohio.

<i>We put up the house.</i>

<i>It'd be better
if we thought about it.</i>

<i>I'm here to pick up a package
for William Harrison.</i>

<i>I'm sorry to say, but
he'll need another operation.</i>

<i>With all that cash,
you'll love me.</i>

<i>My little lamb has to be
all white with black ears.</i>

<i>You're very handsome.</i>

<i>They're gonna love you.</i>
