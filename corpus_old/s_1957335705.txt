I don't know how
much time I have left.

[Isabella sniffs]
[Isabella sobs]

These 5G towers ever since
they've been popping up,

people have been,

[Isabella sobs]

acting so weird.

[Isabella sniffs]

I don't wanna say it's zombies

because that they don't,
they don't exist, right?

Like that's like impossible

but I don't how to
explain what I've seen,

what I've heard.

I'm so, I'm so scared.

I'm hungry and I'm scared.

I haven't left my house in weeks

and I keep hearing
things outside my house.

[Isabella sobs]
[Isabella sniffs]

[window thuds]

Shit.

[window thuds]

Oh my god.

[zombie growls]

[Isabella shrieks]

[Isabella mumbles]

I think it's gonna
come in the house.

[zombie shrieks]

[window thuds]

See,
[Isabella mumbles]

[window thuds]
[zombie growls]

[Zombie banging on window]

Okay, I don't know
what's about to happen.

Hey watch it.

You're gonna drop that plate.

We have dozens of
the bloody things,


Yes but that was a
present from mum remember?

From that dinner service thing.

You nearly finished?

Yeah, just a few knives
and forks and I'm done.

Why did he say

hands that do dishes are
as soft as your face?

It was my turn to
wash yesterday.

I've done it three
times this week.

My face is as rough as fuck.

Got my own bloody
bristles on a toothbrush.


And I love every
single one of them.

[Barney exclaims]
[Angie laughs]

Watch it.

[plate thuds]

[Barney slaps]

Hey, that hurt.

[Angie sighs]

You know what I saw at
the stores the other week?

Mango and passion
fruit very liquid.

What next?

Kumquat.

Kiwi.

[Angie chuckles]

Tomato probably.

Hey isn't the water
supposed to go down

the plughole a different
way in Australia?

Yeah, there a lot of things
differently in Australia.

We don't call it down
under for nothing.

[Angie chuckles]

No, seriously.

Yeah I think so.

It swirls to the left,
anti-clockwise here

and clockwise on neighbors.

You sure that's right?


No, you're wrong.

Clockwise on Coronation Street.

What about there
down [mumbles] up.

They don't really drink much
water down there do they?

Fiver says your wrong.

Wanna bet?

a five enough yet?

and look at this then.

[drain crackles]

Oh bollocks, missed it.

[waters splashes]

Yeah, see.

That's one plastic
five buck you owe me.

Oh balls.

Well I have to give
you later anyway.

I'm off into town now, need
to return these library books.

Oh, have you taken your phone?

Oh yes.

Thanks for reminding me.

All right Ang, see you later.

I'll look after India


and don't let them talk
you in turning an upgrade.

All right you.

Don't spend too long on
that you'll get square eyes.

[Man On Radio] And
rioting in Northern Sweden

appears to have spread to
the South of the country

and across the
border into Norway.

Swedish authorities have
issued a statement saying

that the situation
is under control

although there appears
to be a media blackout

in areas hardest hit by
the initial outbreak.

The social unrest and writing-

[Man On Radio] Two of
those received minor injuries

and were treated very soon.

Swedish authorities have
issued a plea for calm

following a second night of
rioting in north of the country.

The unrest appears to
have spread to the south

although Stockholm so
far appears unaffected.

Norwegian authorities report
an isolated pockets of trouble

in a small number of towns
on the border of Sweden.

[camera rattles]

[footsteps pattering]

Hello, can I help?

Yeah, can you have a
look at my phone for me?

It's frozen on the home screen.

I tried turning it
off and on again

but it just won't work.

Yes.

We've had quite a
few of those today.

They've updated the
operating system

and some of the older units
have frozen on the reboot.

Can you fix it?

It's an old model.

There's not much I can
do with it I'm afraid.

Have you thought
about upgrading?

No, I'm not in a contract.

How much for new one?

Look, we've got
a special one today

with discount in a
lot of the top units.

Much more affordable.

Let me show you.

This one is proving
very popular.

[ominous music]

Very popular.

[ominous music continues]

[Angie gasps]

You don't like it?

I'm sure there's something
here to catch your eye.

[ominous music continues]

[both groan]

you don't like it?

[Angie sobs]

Hey, calm down, calm
down, calm down, calm down.

[Angie breathing heavily]

Now what seems to
be the problem.

[ominous music]

[policeman laughs]

[camera bleeps]

So how are you feeling after
everything you told me today?

It still seems so real to me.

Seems?

Before, it was real.

Nobody else seems to
remember it happening.

I'm not sure.

Not being sure
is a good start.

When's Barney coming
in to see you?

This evening.

He's coming from work.

Well you do seem
much calmer now Angie.

How are you getting
on with quardraphine?

It makes me sleepy.

Okay.

I think we should stick
with it for a little longer.

Is that okay?

Do I have a choice?

It does seem to be working.

Doesn't seem so real now.

You've worked really,
really hard today.

Well done Angie, well done.

[ominous music]

[button clicks]
[laptop thuds]

And you're confident
of the outcome?

Yeah, it's the
progress is a bit slow

but yeah she's responding okay.

And we're nowhere
nearer to finding out why

she never responded to
the initial treatment.

You're always gonna
get the exception

but overall the results
have been outstanding.

And have they're been
any of the cases like this?

One or two right
across the country

but nothing around here.

Yeah, it's good
that she's responding.

I wouldn't wanna take
more drastic action.

Well, if she doesn't
continue to respond,

we're just gonna
have to kill her.

[ominous music]

little bit better.

[Isabella sobbing]

There's no way.

There's no way.

If anyone finds this I'm

[Isabella sobs]

I'm sorry.

You can't kill

I can't go out like that.

I can't go out like that.

Please know I tried.
[Isabella sobs]

I tried.

[Isabella sobs]

I'm not a coward.

[sobbing continues]

[Isabella breaths heavily]

[gun cocks]

[zombie growls]

[static crackles]

Hey guys.

I just wanted to pop in here

and say hello and ask
how you're holding up.

It's been like three
days, I don't even know

but it seems like a month.

I'm so tired of being indoors.

I really wanna go out
and get some sun but

they're saying that
we probably shouldn't

even be going outside.

So this is the best I've got.

I'm like literally so pasty
for the summer it's depressing

and my dogs keep
barking at things,

I don't even know what
they're barking at.

It's probably like there's
too many neighbors at home

or something or like children.

There's like lots of kids
home now too 'cause who knows?

Do you guys have any
insight on what's going on?

If so, sound off in the
comment section below

and if you have any tips for me

on how I can get
my nice summer tan

while doing whatever this is
for however long we have to

or using olive oil or
any kind of like products

that I can get from
home 'cause I don't know

if the maid's gonna come
back and get my grocery list

and what am I
supposed to do then?

It's like,

hello how am I supposed
to fend for myself?

Like I just literally don't.

So, just let me know
what you guys are up to.

Love you all, I
miss you so much.

Bye.

Hey guys, I am just
popping in again.

Oh my videos used to
be so much more fun

this is so not fun
but Muffy and Buffy

have to go outside and potty

and I can't even
take them for a walk

and now no one has
come by to check on me,

it's getting really
weird out here.

Like normally I'd
be really excited

that I don't have people
around but the other night

there was like this
really creepy person

and they were walking around
kind of checking on things,

at least I hope they
were checking on things.

Buffy what are you doing?

Oh my God Buffy does not
even know what to do.

Buffy is like, we
don't poop on property.

Like we just don't do this.

We're making due
with what we have.

There's not even anybody
golfing right now

What is happening?

Okay.

So and my pool service,
what is going on with that?

So like, yeah there was this
guy and he was like looking

over the fence and I thought
maybe he was paparazzi

but there was something
really weird about him.

Like, I don't know
if it's just the fact

that people can't get
proper nutrition right now

with the grocery stores overrun

but oh my God, what was
wrong with that guy?

And I don't even
know who to call.

Like what if he like
gets over my fence

and like actually
sees in my windows.

I'm such a private person
and I just can't right now,

it's just so much.

[Chloe sighs]

So does anyone have any advice
for like how to build things?

You know, like we just board
some things up or something.

Buffy.

Oh my God.

My dog is like so
lost right now.

We usually have like people
to help us walk them.

They don't just like go outside
and potty, like savages.

Just crazy, crazy,
crazy stuff right now

and starting to get
really worried and

yeah if you guys could
just give me some insight

on kind of like where you're at,

how are you holding things up,

how do you make booby
traps in case, you know

somebody wants to look
at me take a shower

or something we're
so weird but you know

people will take
advantage of hard times,

they really do.

Oh my God it's
getting windy now too.

[Chloe exclaims]

I have no help.

Oh, there goes my hat.

Okay I guess it's
time for me to go.

I need both hands
to hold this hat.

It's a really nice hat though.

So, I hope you guys
are having a great day.

Okay, I normally would not
let you guys see me like this

but that guy is back again.

My dogs were barking like
crazy and I, [stutters]

I don't know.

I just looked out the
window and I saw him.

I think it's the same
guy, I don't know

but it looked like it,

it looked like he was
trying to like dig.

Like he was trying to
dig under my fence like,

I'm literally shaking right now

and I would normally
charge for you guys

to see me like this but I
need someone to talk to,

I'm getting really scared like,

I've heard reports earlier

that it had something to
do with our cell phones

or like our WiFi or our
fucking what was it?

Oh pardon me, our network.

Was it a network coverage?

Is it my cell provider?

I think it might've been my
cell provider, I don't know.

I was only half listening,

I know I should have been
more diligent with this

but I don't know what to do

and I tried to call the
police but the lines are like,

I'm just getting
that busy signal.

I don't know

and I don't really have
any friends and like,

I don't know my neighbors, so
I don't know if he needs help.

Am I supposed to go
out there and help him?

Like usually someone
would tell me what to do

and I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

Oh.

[Chloe sighs]

I am so scared, I'm starting
to get really scared

'cause I don't...

I don't know if maybe
I'm imagining this

or if he's really like,
what am I supposed to do?

I really like, I have
a lot of windows and

I don't,

I'm gonna [mumbles]

I'm gonna keep,
[Chloe exclaims]

I can't even talk.

Like I'm just so frustrated.

I'm gonna keep trying
to call the police

if somebody like
knows what to do

I'm such a
non-aggressive person.

I've never hurt anybody, I've
never used a weapon before.

I don't even own a gun.

I don't even own a gun.

My dogs are like really small.

Oh my God I should find my dogs.

Oh my God like,

I haven't heard them
bark for a bit like,

holy shit I gotta go, I gotta go

I'm so sorry.

[static crackles]

Okay what it is people don't
seem to understand out there.

The world has gone
totally crazy.

No one understands
what's going on,

no one knows what's going on.

In other countries, in foreign
countries around the world,

it's all happening.

There's a 5G signal that
literally is emitting these waves,

is turning people into zombies.

I cannot stress this enough.

It's turning people
into zombies,

It's giving people corona virus.

The virus is mutating
and creating zombies.

You can get a piece of shungite,
you can put it in water.

Okay put it in here, look,

if you put shungite in water,
that is gonna protect you,

that's going to heal
you, that's gonna stop

your body absorbing these
5G negative radiation waves

that is pumping out
into the masses.

People need to understand this.

People need to understand.

[static crackles]

I swear I saw that
guy out here again.

I want you guys to
see him and tell me

if he looks sick or
what, what do you think?

Like, I just want
someone else to see him.

I know I'm not imagining
him, I know he's here.

God, I just saw him,
where did he go?

Fuck.

I just saw him.

I just saw him.

Oh my god.

Wait, wait, wait I think I
see him, I think I see him.

He's like,

oh my god.

Hey what are you doing?

He's just standing there.

He's just, he's right
there in the bushes.

Do you see?

Right there.

Right there.

He's like right
there by that tree

across the way at
my neighbor's house.

What are you doing?

Oh my god, he's
just standing there.

Wait, wait, what?

Who the fuck is that now?

What?

Oh my God I think there's
someone else there.

There's something
wrong with her.

She,

is she, she looks like,

I can't tell she's
really far away but

she's walking like she's hurt.

I just...

What do you want?

[engine revs in background]

I think that guy's
coming back over here.

I think that guy's
coming back over here.

Oh my God.

What do I do?

I wish you guys could see this.

I want you to see
these people like,

I think there's something
wrong with them.

I got, I don't even...

[Chloe exclaims]

who do I call,
like what do I do?

Like I can't get
through to anybody.

[Chloe gasps]

I gotta go.

Okay.

This might be my last video.

I think I heard
someone downstairs.

[Chloe exclaims]

I don't know, I don't
feel really good either.

[Buffy barks faintly]

Buffy.

Oh my god, I think
Buffy is out there.

Buffy.

[door clicks]

Shit.

Buffy.

Buffy?

[Chloe retches]

Buffy, come, get in
here, get, come on no,

No where are you going?

Come back.

Come, come.

Please come.

Come in.

Hurry.

Buffy.

Oh my god, what the fuck?

[Chloe groans]

[Chloe exclaims]

What is happening?

[Chloe sobs]

Buffy please come back.

What is that?

[Chloe gasps]

[Chloe retches]

Guys, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

[Chloe sobs]

[scratches on door]

Something's wrong.

Buffy?

Buffy.

[machete thuds]

[Chloe thuds]

[Chloe groans]

[Chloe groans]

What's happening?

[Chloe screams]

[static crackles]

Hey guys.

This is Scythe000

and I think this might
be my last blog post.

I keep checking the news to
see if anything's changed

but my Internet's failing.

My cellular reception
is almost gone.

This roll out's not what
they told us it was gonna be.

I can hear them outside.

I don't know if you
guys can see this

but they tried to get in.

I can't flip the camera,
take a look at this.

I don't know if you
can see that okay but

I managed to close
the window on it

and cut his hand off
but this is serious.

I don't know how
much more I can take.

I'm not able to
get any responses

from friends or family anymore.

You know, I originally did this

because I enjoyed connecting
with the world and yeah.

You know I'd get a thrill out of

being a YouTuber and a vlogger

and seeing people respond
and react to everything

but it's all going away.

This is real.

It's kind of crazy
to think about but

it feels like we're
seriously living

in a historical event here.

Something that's, I don't
wanna say apocalyptic

but if we as a
society get past this

it's gonna have lasting
effects for generations.

This is world changing.

You guys know that I have a
background in engineering.

This is not what they
told us 5G was gonna be.

It was supposed to simply
be using different spectrum

that we'd already been using
for different purposes.

Maybe different intensities,
no big deal, right?

It's not even supposed
to be ionizing radiation.

I don't know what this is

but there's more at work
here than we know about

and than what
they're telling us.

God, I keep checking
for updates but

I'm just losing my mind here.

I don't know if anyone's
even gonna see this report.

I'm walking around
checking carefully to see,

oh my God, I think I see
some down the street.

Oh my God.

I keep trying not to
make too much noise

because I'm just, I'm worried
they're gonna find me.

Think I can hear them coming.

This is no good.

I don't know if I
can handle this guys.

I really don't.

We've gotta get through this.

There's gotta be a better
way than just sitting here

and waiting to die.

I've been following all
the precautions but still.

[Scythe000 coughs]

Oh my God.

[Scythe000 coughs]

It must be happening.

[Scythe000 coughs]

I can't believe this.

It's not fair.

[Scythe000 coughs]

Oh my God.

[coughing continues]

It's not supposed
to end like this.

Guys, I shouldn't be infected.

Right?

It must've been the end.

Some, somehow 4G or the
5G has gotten to me or

something from the hand I
chopped off it's it's gotten in.

[Scythe000 clears throat]

Oh my god.

If anyone sees this,

please, please don't,

don't forget to like
and subscribe and share.

[Scythe000 coughs]

[phone thuds]

[static crackles]

Goddamn.

There is a lot of
them out there.

[Tommy hyperventilating]

I've never seen that
many out there before.

God, I hope they
didn't see me pull in.

This shit's getting crazy.

Fuck, fuck.

What the hell am I
supposed to do now?

That is way more than
I've ever seen out there.

Omaha, the only thing I
could think of is that

it's become one
of those hot spots

that they're talking about.

I heard talk like, you
know a couple of weeks ago

but you know what?

You know why I think
it was a hotspot?

It's 'cause of those
goddamn 5G towers.

Yeah.

They put them in like a
month, month and a half ago

and then that is when all
this stuff started happening.

[zombies growl]

Fuck they found me.

[zombies growling]

Shit, that sounds
like a lot of them.

[growling continues]

God, I don't know if
my doors can hold.

All right.

I don't know how
much time I got left

but I gotta show you guys
something real quick.

Okay guys this is what
I've been working on

for the past couple of days.

It hasn't been all that easy

'cause I've had
severe WiFi issues.

Okay.

Here is the first recorded
coronavirus death in Omaha.

Here, this is when
they started installing

those fucking 5G towers
and then shortly after that

the first known
zombie in the area

and if you look at the
rates that they're expanding

they're at the same rate
as the corona virus deaths.

They have to be connected,
they just have to be.

All right listeners,

first things first, don't
forget to subscribe.

Now, the only conclusion
that I can come to

from all this information
is that somehow

the 5G service is affecting

and mutating the corona
virus to reanimate

those poor fuckers
that died from it.

That's the only thing
that I can think of.

I mean, I don't know what
we're gonna do from here out.

The way those guys are
multiplying out there there's,

I don't know if anything
is gonna stop 'em.

We can't get out of
the house right now

there's way too many.

I don't know if I have
enough food to outlast it

and the worst thing is I'm
gonna run out of fucking booze.

This is terrible.

Fuck, fuck.

[door thuds]

[static crackles]

[Enrique panting]

[trash can thuds]

[gate clanks]

[door thuds softly]

[Enrique panting]

[door knob clicks]


Tool shed.

[door rumbles softly]

[Enrique panting]

All right.

[Enrique panting]

I think I can hold
up here for a bit.

All right.

Okay.

[Enrique exhaling sharply]

Okay, okay.

[Enrique panting]

My name is Enrique Montia.

This 5G shit is no joke.

People that died
from the beer virus

just get up and kill.

They're coming back to life.

I know it's hard to believe

but that's what the fuck
is happening right now.

[panting continues]

I don't know how much
time I have left.

[door thuds]
[zombie growls]

They're fucking here.

By the looks of it I
don't have a lot of time.

My signal is weakening.

That 5G shit is
getting stronger.

[panting continues]

I don't know.

[panting continues]

[door thuds]
[zombie growls]

Fuck.

They're gonna get in.

They're gonna get in.

Okay.

[panting continues]

One thing you gotta do

stay the fuck home.

Wash your fucking hands.

Wash your ass, whatever the
fuck it is you have to do

just do it.

[panting continues]

Okay motherfuckers,
you'll get your chance

but I ain't going
out like no bitch.

All right.

You guys will get your chance.

It's time to meet old penis.

All right.

[panting continues]

All right.

You guys want some,

come and get it.

[zombies growl]

All right, you want some.

[gun fires]

[static crackles]

Hey guys it's me
Tommy from Tommy's Blog

I'm still here.

Don't forget to subscribe.

We need to get all
the views we can get

we gotta get this
news out there.

All right.

It's been 34 days since the
first known case in Omaha

and for me, 15 days
since I've heard

or seen from anybody
in my family.

At this point, I gotta believe

that I'm not gonna
see 'em anymore.

Alive anyway.

All right here's my day so far.

I'm on my way back from
an unsuccessful supply run

and I really need to
get back to my place

because my phone is almost dead.

I was heading down the
street to the mini mart,

by the time I got inside there,

there was way too
many of them bastards

all the way around in there.

I was barely able
to get out of there

and back into my car before
they were all over me.

I think I've made enough
turns on my way out of there

to get rid of those with guys

but almost back to
my place now and man,

there are a lot of those
bastards around here.

Looks like when I get there

I'm gonna have to make a
run for it into the side,

the front is way,
way too obvious.

Okay, here we go.

You guys ready?

[ominous music]

Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

Okay.

All right guys.

I am in my storm cellar,
it's not a big spot.

I'm just hoping
they didn't see me

before I was able
to get in here.

This is the only
place I can hold out.

Oh shit.

Goddamn it.

I don't know if this door,

if it's gonna be
able to hold or not.

I don't know if I can
make it out of here people

but there's one thing

Subscribe, get the
news out, okay?

We gotta do this
and I want the hits.

Jesus I am fucked.

[static crackles]

Hey everyone,
Fred Stevens here.

I've had it.

I've had it.

I can't put on a good act
here for these videos.

I'm not gonna give you

a great entertainment
video today, okay?

I have lost everything

because of this stupid
fucking 5G bullshit

and let me tell
you, I am a vlogger,

a internet personality
kind of person

and I liked the idea
of faster speeds.

Having speeds faster
than speed of light

because I upload
a lot of videos.

I do a lot of posting
on social media.

So I was happy at
first I thought that

5G was gonna be a
good thing for me.

I thought that it was gonna
help me out in the long,

I thought I wasn't
gonna have to keep

siting the fucking
round waiting for things

forever that were
slow as shit to upload

because everybody always
wanted me to put things up

in for four fucking K.

Do you know how long it takes

to upload a fucking video in 4K?

Especially me.

I ramble the fuck on

so my videos were
pretty fucking long.

So for 4G you know, 4K.
4G wasn't fast enough

so I wanted 5G.

So then I could upload faster
and I could give you guys

my beautiful fucking face
and all its glorious details

in 4K but you always were
up my fucking asshole.

So yeah, I was excited about 5G.

I didn't think 5G was gonna
scramble everyone's minds,

turn people into
fucking zombies,

turn them into fucking
crazy walking dead.

Wasn't expecting that.

Who was expecting that?

Who thought that was
going to fucking happen?

And now there's zombies
outside everywhere.

Everyone, every day
more and more people

are turned into the
walking fucking deceased

and I'm sick of it.

I can't do a fucking thing.

I can't go anywhere.

Yes I've got lots
and lots of movies.

Yes I do.

I have lots of movies.

What's fun about that?

And what's fun when you
can feel the 5G singles,

the five, signals getting
stronger and stronger

and stronger and how much longer

till I turn into a
fucking walking dead.

How much longer till I turn
into a zombinoid zombie?

How much longer?

How much fucking longer?

You know what?

I don't even care anymore.

Here's the thing,
here's the thing.

It would be much easier
for me to just go outside,

leave my house and hopefully
turn into a fucking zombie

'cause you know what?

I'm tired of it.

I'm fucking tired of
being in this room,

I'm tired of being in here,

I'm tired of worrying
about trying to put up

some kind of a video to entertain
all of you fucking idiots.

I'm sick of it, I'm sick
and fucking tired of it.

I'm sick and tired of
Karen, I don't care anymore.

Here's the thing, I
don't give a shit.

I don't give a shit
what any of you do,

I don't give a shit
what I do anymore.

I don't give a shit
about making posts,

I don't give a shit about 5G.

All 5G did was destroy my life.

It killed my family,
killed my brother,

it killed everybody.

It killed every
thing that matters.

I got no lady friends,

maybe if I was in this
fucking war with a lady friend

maybe then that would help
but nothing helps, okay?

So I'm tapping off
I'm very fucking,

I don't even wanna get in.

I'm just gonna go out the door

and hopefully get turned
into a fucking zombie

'cause I'm tired of it.

I don't care anymore.

This is tiresome and
I'm not gonna perform

for any of you fucking idiots
anymore that's the thing.

My performances are over.

My content is done.

Find someone fucking else,
whoever else is there left

'cause pretty soon I'm sure

even you fuckers
that are watching

are gonna turn into
a fucking zombie.

The 5G, the 5G is
coming for you fuckers.

So let's just, let's just
set this fucking thing up.

[Fred mumbles]

Can you see me?

Can you see the fucking door?

Okay.

All right.

Show's over, don't need
the bowling hat anymore.

See you guys later.

Oh yeah, oh wait.

[Fred vocalizes]

My grand exit.

[zombies growl]
[Fred screams]

[static crackles]

I went to see my dad
because I wanted to give him

some of the shungite to
put in his house, to put,

put on his WiFi

and when I opened
the door, walked in,

I saw my dad and he had the
same shirt he always wears.

He was walking into the kitchen
and I put my arm on his back

and it was too late.

He already been bitten.

So as I reached my hand
out, he grabbed mine

and he bit my arm.

It was too late and it's
too late for me now as well.

I'd just like to say
to all of you out there

take this fucking
thing seriously.

Please, please.

Use this shungite because
this can save you.

This shungite can save
you I promise you please.

It's too late for me now.

I just hope I get to help.

Really hope I can help
someone else out there.

When the dead roam the streets,

the gates of heaven
have been closed

and a new master will
rise from the ashes.

[static crackles]

What's up non-believers,
it's Skeptic Steve here.

A bit of an, a bit of
an unusual video today.

As you may know we were we're
planning our next video.

We were looking, we were
looking at 5G zombie stories.

You've probably
seen them online.

[Skeptic Steve chuckles]

We thought it was,

we thought it was just nonsense

like everything else but

so you know how we usually
do our videos, me and Brad

we pour through research,

we go through every secondary
source that we can find

and we go out and we go
and see the site itself

and so we did for this.

We went and saw the 5G mast

and [chuckles] as
Brad always does,

he runs straight up towards it

and immediately he was,
you know, touching it,

making a point to the camera

of how silly these people that
believe this nonsense are,

of course but we were fine.

We were fine and we
got home and nothing,

nothing had happened.

Then a few days later,
Brad starts getting

aggressive, confrontational,

skin starts changing color

and it's exactly like they
describe in the stories,

it's exactly like they describe

in all the reports that I
read from around the world

and he starts,

starts hitting me.

So I did what any
rational person would do

and I picked up a hammer
that was next to me

and I smashed him over
the head several times

and I, I think...

See I went to the 5G mast too.

I went there too.

[Steve chuckles]

So I'm gonna start changing.

[Steve chuckles]

[zombies growl]

[growling continues]

Brad?

Oh.

[static crackles]
[ominous music]

crazy 5G zombie fucks.

No solicitors.

Shit, just keep your mouth shut.

It's less real if I
watch through the screen.

Hey Justin, if you're
still out there,

I've been walking
for hours today.

The world has gone to shit.

There was some kind of incident,

this damn 5G phone network
everyone has been raving about

has literally turned them
into raving zombie assholes.

All over the world

and to think we'll be
safe here in Australia,

5G has rolled up practically
everywhere, we're fucked.

So I figure, right?

All the wireless phone
networks around here

run through to a central
point, this tower.

So if I could jam it somehow,

I don't know it's just a theory

but if I could shut it down,

could it neutralize spread?

Let's try and find out.

Hey kangaroo I'm pretty
lonely, you wanna be my friend?

No, fine then, see you later.

[footsteps pattering softly]

[knocks on door]

[door squeaks]

I don't know what happened here

but I'll tell you something,
that's not cranberry sauce.

Do you remember that
time years ago Justin,

when we were younger,
place just like this.

We hold up with this two
country girls, sisters,

then their mama came
home with the shotgun.

Holy shit we we're
running our asses off

and you literally cut your
ass on a barbed wire fence.

We barely escaped.

Good times man.

Seems like some well powered
individuals have been here.

A gun would be pretty
handy today, wouldn't it?

But they're tough to
come by around here.

Thanks politicians.

Look at that, beautiful,
in the middle of nowhere.

Look at us now discovering
beauty out and about

because our faces aren't
glued to our phones.

Says the dude with his
face glued to his phone.

[zombie growls]

Crap what was that?

This nice, practically plastic.

[footsteps pattering softly]

What's the chance of 5G zombies

gonna pop out of here
and eat my 1G face?

Just had to be sure anyway.

Fucking useless.

[Wanderer sighs]

Nothing we guessed could
have ended up like this.

Before corona virus was
bad, well then 5G came along

and caused the perfect
marriage of mutation.

Anyway it doesn't
matter what happened

we all knew 5G was gonna be
bad news but no one cared.

They call us conspiracy nuts.

Always conspiracy
guy on Twitter.

Everyone thinks
conspiracies don't exist,

they're too far fetched unless

there's a politician or company,

all the shits for you to
hate, then you suddenly

miss the fucking
citizen reporter

connecting the invisible
dots as to why the object

of your projection must
be pulling the strings

behind some major bad mojo.

Well hey bucko, try this.

Soak your fruit in
boiling hot water

with vinegar mixed in and
what's the pesticides roll off.

Look, if I can do this,
shut the tower down,

things are gonna be different.

Let's just go back to analog.

Analog everything.

Analog phone, analog
news, analog movies.

That means video tape.

Analog ass, screw
your dating apps.

Barbed wire, great.

Shit I'm stuck.

I'm bleeding too.

This situation look familiar?

[ominous music]

Can you hear it?

I must be close.

It's splitting my brain open.

It's just over this
ridge I'm sure.

Fuck looks like a
misjudged the distance.

Mapping up didn't work
properly and why was that?

Not compatible with 5G.

Just gonna sit down
for a while, here.

[zombie growls]

I hear you Justin.

I'm sorry I couldn't
save you mate

but I'm glad you remember me.

[zombie growls]

[static crackles]

My name is Lucy.

I have a fiance Adam

and I'm starting
this vlog because

it's getting pretty
bad out there now

and I just wanna
document our story.

So corona virus has
been going around now

for the past few months

and it turns out
anyone who has it

is more likely to "change"

due to the "5G
waves" as they say

and changes for the worst.

People are essentially
turning into zombies

and it's a freaking zombie
apocalypse going on now.

So,

screw staying in this
crappy rented house

and I've been working
at a grocery store too

but honestly, screw that job.

Customers just like,
no one wears masks

or stays six feet away and

we just need to get away
from people, we've decided.

So we're gonna pack up our
things, our essential things,

we're gonna pack up
our camping equipment,

I'm gonna pack up this dog

and we're just gonna find
a spot probably somewhere

in the woods or
something, I have no idea.

Somewhere secluded though but

we'll camp out and see how
this all plays out I guess.

I'm stressed.

Okay, we decided to pack up
my car instead of his Jeep

although a Jeep would be nice.

His car, his Jeep
is kind of fucked

so we're just gonna take mine,

I just got mine serviced.

We just think it's better in
the long run to take mine.

So.

All right, come on here we go.

I'm coming.

Okay, we're on the road.

They've been playing this
weird broadcast on the radio

it's really creeping me out.

[Man On Radio] Indoors at
all times until further notice.

There is no known cure for
the virus at this time.

[Adam coughs]

Anyways.

[coughing continues]

We're gonna head towards
North Nebraska I think.

There's like a river and
some camping areas I think

before all this happened.

[coughing continues]

Might be blocked off.

[coughing continues]

It doesn't sound good

but

probably sneak
around or something.

[coughing continues]

We'll break in there, we'll
find something, right?

Yeah we'll find something.

It'll still be fine maybe.

We'll be fine.

We'll find a good place.

[Adam coughs]

Okay.

I'll update soon.

Let's play a game.

A game?

Right now?

Yeah.

All right.

I just wanna take my mind
off on this for a second.

Okay.

Let's play I spy.

All right.

Okay.

I spy with my little
something blue.


Dang it.

Okay, it's your turn.

All right.

I spy something white.

That road sign.

Congratulations, you did it.

[Adam coughs]

Are you okay?

I'm fine.

We'll just, we'll get to
the spot, we'll be okay.

We'll be fine.

It's your turn anyway.

Okay.

Well,
[Adam coughs]

I spy something black and white.

The dog.

Just forget it.

Okay, we just stopped at this
park and let the dog go pee.

We were gonna eat something.

I just peed by the
bush over there.

Good thing I bought
all that toilet paper

but anyways we're gonna
refresh, get back in the car,

everything's fine, we're
gonna get to our camping spot.

Okay, update soon.

Okay,
[Lucy exhales sharply]

car won't start.

[Adam coughs]

The electronics
are all fucked up.

[coughing continues]

It's also effectively
locked us in.

So, I don't know what to do now.

[Lucy exhales sharply]

It's fucking hot.

It's fucking hot in here.

Can I just feel your forehead?

[Adam coughs]

It's really hot.


I should sleep.


I'll be fine.

Just gotta sleep.

Adam are you okay?

Oh Adam, what am I gonna do?

[Adam exclaims]
[Lucy screams]

[static crackles]

[Gizmo coughs]

I apologize for my
absence as of late.

It's been about two
months since 5G went live.

About a month since
my last update.

I've, I had to keep moving
ever since the outbreak.

Nowhere's safe.

I don't understand why
everyone bought the lies,

welcomed it in, sure
corona virus sucked

and there were a lot
of deaths from that

but 5G was too good to be true.

Is a savior, high speed internet
gonna keep us connected.

No, it's gonna kill us.

It did kill most of us

and those of us that were
smart enough to stay away.

Now we're all that's left.

Well us and these

Military convoys.

[Gizmo sighs]

They come by about
every hour or so.

They're rounding us up
and I don't know why.

I don't know what
they do with us,

I don't know where they take us

but they're rounding people up.

[birds chirping]

I don't know if I can do this.

I don't know if I can
do this on my own.

[Gizmo sighs]

There's so much

that

that I had left to do.

So many fucking things.

If anyone gets this message,

[Gizmo coughs]

I am in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Please,

please come for me.

[Gizmo coughs]

Is that blood?

Fuck.

[Gizmo coughs]

[coughing continues]

[Gizmo thuds]

[Gizmo retches]

[Gizmo growls]

[ominous music]

[static crackles]

It's been 132 days
since quarantine.

Everything started out fine.

People were
secluding themselves,

they were wearing
masks and rubber gloves

when they had to
venture out but then

something changed.

The virus took over
and started to kill.

Rations started to become scarce

and gun sales started to rise.

It was every man for himself

but the scariest thing is
that the dead started to rise.

They started to
come back to life.

I don't know they think
it has something to do

with the 5G or
frequency or something

but they roam day and
night looking to feed.

Feed on human flesh.

Four days ago, my
family and I got bit.

Everyone died

but for some reason I'm
still here, I'm still alive.

There's no one around.

I'm all alone.

If you can see this, go
to the Hollywood sign.

I don't think that
they can climb

and I feel like
we'll be safe there.

We can scavenge for
food and build shelter

and be there together

but remember to
protect yourself.

Make sure you're armed
and I'll see you there.

Stay safe.

My name is Diego Garcia.

Two years ago my
life was perfect.

I was so happy, so excited,
everything was amazing.

I had the perfect job,
I got paid so much.

My wife had a great
job as well like,

we were just so
excited, so happy.

We were living
the American dream

that's what I would call
it, the American dream.

Where everything is
supposed to be amazing

but it was when the damn
fucking 5G cell service

started that's when
everything went down hell.

I never thought I would lose
everything I worked for,

everything I loved.

Everything I loved it was gone.

When the 5G cell
service came out,

everybody was excited, yes

but guess what?

There were no benefits, that
was the end for everybody.

I mean the beginning to the end.

Yeah.

Those, all of those
fucking damn viruses.

Yeah that's when
everything mutated.

Yeah, yeah

and all of this damn
viruses came out,

yeah everything popped up.

Yeah, the world started going
crazy, they lost their shit.

Yeah.

We hold in.

My wife die, she pass away.

Yeah and guess what?

It didn't end there.

It kept going.

How the fuck did this happen?

This was supposed to
be the best year yet

and the fucking government
all what they care is about,

yeah undocumented people.

Yeah they call him
illegal aliens.

Yeah.

Motherfuckers.

They only care about
building a wall,

a fucking wall for god sake.

They spent trillions of
dollars fighting a fucking war.

A fucking war.

Yes that's what they've done
for so many years now, decades

and guess what?

No one expected
this shit to come.

A fucking virus.

It's killed millions of people,
millions of people are gone.

So that is me.

I have no food, no
power, no cell service,

I have no water
anymore, this is done,

look at this, yeah this is safe.

The whole city, the whole
world is full of zombies,

fucking dumb zombies.

That's what they turned
us into, a fucking zombie.

[Diego speaks foreign language]

Yeah.

[Diego speaks foreign language]

I know that I never
gonna touch them again

or see them again.

Yeah, the fucking American dream

it turned out to be
a night fucking mare.

[Diego sobs]

[Diego coughs]

[Diego sniffs]

[Diego speaks foreign language]

[Diego continues speaking
in foreign language]

[Diego speaks foreign language]

[Diego sobs]

[Diego speaks foreign language]

[Diego sobs]
[Diego exclaims]

We're all gonna fucking
die anyways, yeah.

That's what the
government wanted.

They want it to end up,
end with everybody, yeah.

You didn't do anything to help.

No, nothing, nothing.

Yeah, remember your
power that you got

when you see the streets
full of zombies, yeah.

When the world is
destroyed by you.

[Diego sobs]

[Diego exclaims]

This is what you wanted.

This is what you get.

[Diego speaks foreign language]

Look at us, look at me.

[ominous music continues]

It's been six months
now since the uplink.

We've worked closely
with the Chinese

to create a wireless signal
to shepherd the pandemic.

The newly discovered millimeter
was hidden in the 5G signal.

It contained a harmful
form of radiation

to penetrate the
skin, weaken the cells

and make us more susceptible
to infection and create cancer.

The 5G towers themselves
transmitted radiation

and sucked oxygen
out of the atmosphere

and helped the slow up the
regular function of the body

and the initial idea was
simply, destroy the weak,

the elderly and the sick.

The rest of the
population will be more,

more susceptible to
our way of thinking.

Our new world order.

Obviously we failed.

Our COVID-19 mutated
due to the milli waves.

The disease was unstoppable.

Simply put,

we failed.

â™ª Possession â™ª

â™ª Premonitions of
morbid scenes â™ª

â™ª Crucified corpses
wired to machines â™ª

â™ª Stagnant flesh lives
waste and decay â™ª

â™ª Masticating fiends
are easy prey â™ª

â™ª In a land where
arrogance thrives â™ª

â™ª Simulation
stimulating the hive â™ª

[upbeat music continues]

â™ª Subjugation regulated â™ª

â™ª Thought control
ruling nations â™ª

â™ª Trending content satisfies â™ª

â™ª Just dopamine drips prepping
the mind for possession â™ª

â™ª Possession â™ª

â™ª Dead eyes hiding
binary minds â™ª

â™ª Disembodied digital life â™ª

â™ª Bit by bit all losing soul â™ª

â™ª Corporations fighting
for global control â™ª

â™ª Planned obsolescence
feeding the need â™ª

â™ª As vultures pick
the carcass clean â™ª

â™ª Machine learning

â™ª Victims of our own progress â™ª
