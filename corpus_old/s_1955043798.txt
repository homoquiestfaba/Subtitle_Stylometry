[female narrator]
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

<i>...or so the story has been told...</i>

<i>...a boy became acquainted
to a life under water.</i>

[instrumental music]

<i>Or as the locals would tell you...</i>

<i>...a boy became a fish.</i>

<i>The boy came from
an average suburb...</i>

<i>...of a great American city.</i>

<i>While other kids played typical</i>

<i>childhood games...</i>

<i>...our boy was holding his breath.</i>

[bicycle bell ringing]

<i>He held his breath everywhere.</i>

[music continues]

<i>As the boy grew...</i>

<i>...he dazzled all the town's people</i>

<i>with his spectacular ability.</i>

[music continues]

[music continues]

<i>And his legend grew.</i>

[band music]

<i>The summer before he was
to go off into the world...</i>

<i>...the town's people pled for
him to showcase his talents</i>

<i>one final time.</i>

[music continues]

Now, ladies and gentlemen

boys and girls

I give you...

...The Submarine Kid.

[applause and cheering]

<i>This was his final
goodbye to the town</i>

<i>before entering the real world</i>

<i>of endless responsibilities</i>

<i>and tedious obligation.</i>

[camera whirring]


[band music]

[clock ticking]

[camera whirring]

[clock ticking]

<i>As the minutes grew longer</i>

<i>the people got nervous.</i>

[intense music]

<i>But those closest to him</i>

<i>assured the rest of the crowd</i>

<i>that this was all part
of his grand exhibition.</i>

[music continues]

<i>But doubts was creeping in.</i>


[clock ticking]

<i>As the clock turned to 20
minutes past the hour...</i>

<i>...even the ones who knew him best</i>

<i>started to panic.</i>

<i>His girl was the first to
break away from the crowd...</i>

<i>...to search.</i>

[music continues]

[clock ticking]

<i>They all searched...</i>

<i>...and searched...</i>

<i>...and searched.</i>

<i>And they're still searching...</i>

<i>...to this day.</i>

[instrumental music]

Oh.

[female #1] He's here.

Oh.


[male #1] There he is.

[Mrs. Koll] Oh, look at you.

Welcome home, son.
Oh, Josh, careful, careful.

looks great. He looks great.

Oh, honey, we missed you so much.

We would have come to get you.
I know.

Well, why didn't you want
us to come to get you?

Come on, sweetheart. Come on.

What's up, dingleberry?

Hi.
Hey, you.

I love you.


I told your mom not to clean too much.

I know how you like for
things to stay the same.

Hmm.

[Mrs. Koll] Spencer, Emily, dinner!


Uh, well, I am just glad that he's home

so we get to see you more.

Hmm, well, that's the real reason

why I wanted him to come home

so I could hang out with you guys.

So, Spence, you must be
ready to get back to shop.

You know, if he was a girl
we were gonna name him Emily.

Ran into Marc the other day.
Really?

He said he could use some help down there.

[cell phone vibrating]

[Mrs. Koll] Who is it, honey?

Just the guys.

Oh, the rat pack.



Hey.
Yo, dude!

Hey, man.

Yeah. I'm home.

Oh, Nathan's?
No!

Uh-huh, there was just
a shooting over there.

Mom, he just got back from Afghanistan

I think he can handle Echo Park.

Uh, well, why don't
you guys just come here?

Oh, okay, I'll ask her. Hey, mom...

No.
Oh, yeah.

She says, "Go fuck yourself, Mailer."

Ooh!
Language. Language.

Okay. Yeah, I don't
know, I-I'll let you know.

Okay. Okay, bye.

We should go.

Okay.

Then maybe later I can show you...

I can go.


[Mrs. Koll] Well, why don't...
You don't have to go tonight.

I mean you could see them anytime you want.

You're back now... for good.

How do you know that?

What?

I saw it on the news.

Look, just-just don't
scare your brother, okay?

They're all back for good.
Wait a minute.

Cooper, you don't think that's true?

[Mrs. Koll] Oh, stop it,
Josh, of course it is.

Three times was enough.

They are not sending you back again.

I'm just sayin'...
Spencer!

[Mrs. Koll] Please will
you tell your brother?


Let's just go real quick.

I wanna show you the
apartment, it's really cute.

Uh... Let's just clean up here.

I'll tell you what, if I had
been at the desert that long

they'd have to tear me
away from your bedroom.

I can't believe he's goin'
out with his friend's tonight.

Hey, he's young, he
wants to see his buddies.

They can't send him back.
No, they won't.

They can't do that to us.
They won't, he's home.

He's fine, he said...
But we don't know...

Don't listen to Cooper, he doesn't know!

It's all rumors.
We don't know.

How can you know?

Hey, um, can we have the keys?

Can't Emily take you?
She's not going.

That's good. See you later.

[instrumental music]

Monogamy is an intellectual choice.

Amen!

We're all fucking animals,
okay? And that is my point.

And if you think that you
have total self control...

Hey, Paul, if you think that
you have total self control

then... I don't know, man

your girlfriend probably fucking hates you.

Doesn't matter to me 'cause
Imma be fucking her either way.

You're an idiot.
Hey.

Yo, fuck me, little brother.

All grown up and shit.

'Sup, Howie. Where's Toad?

Everything set?
How's your mom doing, Coop?

Uh, fine.
See, perfect example.

You think his mom doesn't have
self-control, you're a dumbass.

She's been ignoring your
little dick for years.

Yeah, well, you gotta put in the 50 years

if you wanna get the gold watch.

I mean think about how many of
us have rocked their hurricane

with Darla over there.

See, that is my point exactly.

We are not built to put
our seed in just one garden.

What does, uh, "Garden"
refer to in this context?

What the fuck do you think
"Garden" refers to, dude?

Garden!

Garden, vagina, garden, okay?

And if you think a woman
doesn't have a libido

then you, my friend,
are the fucking dumbass.

When's the last time you used your libido?

[all laughing]

What's up, puberty?

Big brother comes home, think
you can join the conversation?

Don't pick on him,
Mailer, you fucking bully.


There he is.

Get over here, get over here.

Spencer, you jarhead dick Jake Gyllenhaal

motherfucker, what's up?

Alright... clink, bitches.

Clink.
Clink it up!

Hmm.

Yeah.
Oh, you are ripped, dude.

Ah, I could still take him.

Back on base, I got into
fight with these two rednecks.

Could've used you.

Man, I wish I was there.
I could have translated.

So, uh, you're for good,
or... you're going back?

We'll see.

Hmm.

[upbeat music on radio]

I'm here right now.
Yes, you fucking are.

To our hero who's back... to stay.

Hey, hey, we're have a
true-blooded, whisky-drinkin'

turban-chasin', son of America right here.

Line up and pay your
respects. Buy this man a beer!

Just sit down, sit down.
Buy me a beer too.

I can see nothing's changed.

Uh, where's Toad?

Oh, dude, Toad, he's
fucking pissed at you, dude.

For not callin' him, he's pissed!

Yeah, he's been whining about it all day.

He's been acting weird lately.
He knew you were comin' back.

So...
So he left?

you talked with Toad?

I'm not sure he wants to see you, buddy.

Yeah, but Toad's a fucking
sensitive vagina, man.

Let's go in the back, let's
fucking forget about it.

I don't know if I'm in the mood.

What, you'd take down a sheikh
and now you don't party no more?

Fine.
Yeah!

That's more like it.

Dead man walking!
Let's go, come on.

I can't believe fuckin' Toad isn't here.

Are you gonna bitch about this all night?

Should have called us more, man.

Yeah. What, we're not good
enough for you, Spence?


how am I suppose to keep
getting hyped up for this shit?

[instrumental music]

Why didn't you call me, you asshole?


He was so damn sad.

I can't wait to tell
Emily how dumped you were.

Man, you wanna play with the winner?

I don't see a winner around.
I guess I'll play with you.

It's good to see you. Ah!

No!
What?

Back again, boogers!
Yes!

[pop song playing]


Spencer, take the shot!

[man on radio] Talon
to 1-1, take the shot.

Take the shot.

Take the shot, dude!

[people chanting] Take the shot!

Take the shot!
Take the shot!

Take the shot!
Take the shot!


Yes! In your face.
Whoa!

[indistinct chatter]



[door bell beeps]

Hey!

There he is.

Look at you.

Hey.

So you're back?

I'm back.

Let's see that badge of courage.

No.
Come on.

Who gives a fuck?

Alright, fine.

Yeah, that's a good one.

You're damn lucky.

Hey, you know that.

So, uh, you need a little help around here?


I'm trying to, uh...

...pull a few tricks to
get the business on track.

You know, this is a good
opportunity for you here.

How long are you back?
I don't know.

They say for good, but
that's probably bullshit.

I'd love for you to put in
some time here, you know.

Give you a chance to be a
part of a growing business.

Really?

Well, like I said there's a chance.

You've seen what the
neighborhood's turning into

and a new hip boutique pops up every day.

I gotta capitalize on this, right?

Because nostalgia is the new cool.

But only to a point apparently.

So no one's comin' in?
Exactly.

You know, I gotta make people feel

like they're-they're not
walking into a dungeon...

...or, or...

...if they are walking into a dungeon

it's gotta be a cool
fucking dungeon, doesn't it?

Improvise, adapt and overcome.

Hoo-rah!

Frankly, my, uh, my pockets are dryin' up.

I need a new sign for starters.

You know, somethin'
they actually look up to

from their phones.

I could do that.

Fantastic.

This is gonna be good for you. Believe me.

You know, idle hands and all that shit.

Can you start now?


Imma take this order to the post office.

Can you watch the shop
in case someone comes in?

Yeah, sure.

I'm gettin' some chow. You want somethin'?

No, I'm good.

Alright then.

I'll leave you to it.

[water splashing]


[door bell beeps]

[instrumental music]

[music continues]

Hi.


Do you, uh, do you work here?

Um, yeah.

Uh, do you possibly have any

old newspapers, magazines?

That kinda stuff?

Um...

...I'm sure there are
something like that around here.

Well, we have to find the right pile.

I know you.

I, I saw that article

about you in the paper.

I remember your picture.

Yeah.
So...

You guys all done over there?

Shot the bad guy and everything?

Something like that.

Well, glad to see you're back in one piece.

I just got here myself.

I'm Spencer.

Alice.

Alice?
Yeah.

Yeah.

Uh, yeah, sorry, I wish I
knew where that stuff was

I really just started here today.

Doing maintenance mostly.

I'm gonna build a new sign for the front.

Probably fix the whole Dewey
Decimal situation in here.


The guy who owns the place is out

but he should be back pretty soon, so...

Maybe I'll just...

...poke around and see if
I can find something useful.

Yeah.

[instrumental music]


The... These are perfect.

Oh, good.

You know like a... school
project or something?

Uh, no, I'm just tryin' to
find some images for a new book.

Oh. You're a writer?

Hmm, not exactly, it's
more like a scrapbook.

I've been scavenging for material.

So are you like in the
scrapbooking business?

Oh, no, I was working at
a pet store for a while.

They were jerks.

There comes a point
where you just have to...

...break away and follow your dreams.

That's probably true.

I mean if you find
something you really love.

Right?
Right.

So what do you love, Spencer?

Uh, wha...

I-I'm just asking, like...

Do you love bein' a soldier?
Marines, it's a bit different.

I don't know about that stuff.

Isn't it like you go
to school though, or...

If I wanted that, I guess, yeah.

Well, then w-why join?

I mean why-why go away?

Honestly?

Everyone's always asking
you what you wanna do?

What you wanna make?

The Marine Corp just gives you that.

You don't have to think about it.

It's not your decision
when you're a part of

something bigger.

Well, being a part of something bigger...

...doesn't make it better.

You know that, right?

Is that how you convince
yourself to leave the pet store?

[Alice laughing] Oh, no, I...

[clears throat] I got
fired because I hate cats.

[both laughing]

Yeah.
You know something?

Hmm?
I hate cats.

Really?

They're horrible. They're so mean.

Angry.
They scratch me. They...

Generally unpleasant and...
Horrible.

Wait, my parents had this giant cat

just would look at me and urgh... horrible.

My girlfriend has two, and they just...

Well... uh... I...

I-I guess I'll just, uh, I'll take these.

[instrumental music]

â™ª We're on our way home â™ª

â™ª On our way home â™ª

â™ª We're on our way home â™ª

â™ª We're on our way home â™ª

â™ª We're on our way home â™ª

â™ª We're on our way home â™ªâ™ª

[door opening]

Now, that was really nice.

Much better than the
first night, Mr. Drunkie.



I need to go.

Hey.

I don't care about the other night

I was just joking.

Don't you have work?

Yeah, but we can at least
have breakfast together.


I need to get to the shop.

Spencer...

...I've waited like...

...three years to wake up next to you

and eat breakfast with you in our place.

This is our new life.

It's finally here.

I wanted that too.

You don't want this anymore?

You wanted this the
last time you were back.

Don't do this to me.

Okay, I'm doing the
best that I can. Just...

Just talk to me please.

I don't wanna do this.

What do I owe ya?
No, no, no, come on.

You fight for freedom, I
serve organic eggs to hipsters

I'm buying you breakfast.

Yours is a nobler profession I promise.

There's a party this evening,
your presence is required.

I don't know, man.

No, but your presence is required, alright?

Mailer fucked this rich chick

she wants his balls again, we're goin'.

Okay?
Can I get back to you?

Only with a yes.

I thought that would take you a week.

I gotta find some other
shit for you to do now.

Maybe we could organize the books.

Don't get too ambitious.

I'm gonna take a quick break.

Yeah, well, you've earned it.

[Marc chuckles]


[dramatic music]

<i>[radio static]</i>

[knocking on door]

[breathing heavily]

Hey.

Hey!
I-I didn't mean to scare you.

That's okay, I...

Well, I just wanted to
say I saw the new sign.

Looks really great.

Caught my eye.

Thanks!

That's the hope.


That's just not true, transplant.

Well, it should be.

I pinned you for some Virginia Woolf fan

who loves the gloomy whether.

You are so...

Come on in, I'm just closing up.

I'm so what?

I don't know.

I don't know what you are.



[thunder rumbling]

Oh, damn it.

What?

It's just a little bit of weather.

I'm supposed to go to a party.

Oh, well, don't let me keep you.

It's at a mansion.

The Texan will be in top form.

The Texan?
You'll meet him.

Goodnight, Spencer.

Do you wanna meet him now?

What about your...
We're on a break.

So that means you can take
other girls to parties?

[upbeat music]

[rock song playing]

[male #2] Hey, Howie, go grab
that guy's bow-tie right there.


Masters of the evening...

...this is Mr. Spencer Koll.

Heads-up with the wardrobe
would have been nice.

This place is fucking crazy, right?

Yeah, who do we know here?

Oh, uh, Mailer's second cousin's godfather

knows the guy who owns this place.

Okay, and you hooked up with...
That guy's daughter.

Yeah, it was awesome.

I got it. The little bitch
is crying in the corner.

This is Howie from Texas.
Hello.

All the guys say I'm a stereotype of myself

or whatever the fuck that means?

Yes, we're all very proud
of our resident moron here.

Uh, pot, kettle, kettle, pot.

Eat my shit, Paul.


Spencer, I'm wearing a tie.

You might as well call
me a pussy vandal tonight.


Okay, settle down, champ, huh.

There is only coke in this coke.

Blasphemy!

[all laughing]

Spencer, this is Stephanie. Stephanie...

Hey!
What's up?

Guys, this is...
Alright, everybody.

Can we make a little bit of a moment here?

Can we raise our glasses

to the air

and can we clink it up, bitches.

[all cheering]

[rock song continues]



this chick's name was again?

Alice.
Alice, okay. Alice.

Well, if this is something
that you think you need...

...Spencer...

...fucking go for it. Do it.

Nobody knows better than you.

Emily was your perfect girl...

...this stuff is different.

I mean you can't be nice all of your life.

And if this feels real,
you might as well follow it.

Go for it.

I mean that's what you always said to us.

"Just follow what's real."

Well... real isn't always nice.

[indistinct chatter]

â™ª I guess this can't last forever â™ª

â™ª Maybe be one day I'll remember â™ª

â™ª I'll remember fantasy â™ª

â™ª Perfect like a tree â™ª

â™ª Maybe one day I'll remember â™ª

â™ª How I lived a fantasy â™ª

â™ª All the girls surrounded me â™ª

â™ª We were la la la â™ª

â™ª La la la la â™ª

â™ª La la la la... â™ªâ™ª

[indistinct chatter]

There you are.

Holy shit.

I know.

Who needs this much space?

Right?

I bet they haven't even read any of these.

[man on radio] <i>Talon
1-1, take the shot.</i>

Take the shot.

I say again, engage. I'll copy, over.

Take the shot.

You should build me a desk.

"Submarine Kid."

I-I love this book.

Really?

Yeah.


That's weird.

I know Thunder Lake.

I've never even heard of this.

You've seriously never
read "The Submarine Kid?"

No.

I know every word in this book.

Okay.

Go.

Once upon a time...

...or so the story has been told.

A boy became acquainted

to a life under water.

Keep going.

Hey, his phone's out.
Shit!

Dude is back for two days
and there's already a scandal.

Alright, guys, don't say shit
about this Alice thing, okay?

I mean he only told us 'cause he knows

we can keep this shit tight.

Is that her name, Alice?


They're on a break.


That's the news of the year.

The only one that would talk would be Howie

and he's not gonna remember shit.

You see, you see, you see.


[male #3] Howie, come on, man.


And they're still searching

to this day.

Impressive.

Let's find "War and Peace."

â™ª As long as we stay together â™ª

â™ª The mountain starts to fall â™ª

â™ª As long as we stay together â™ª

â™ª I can see it all... â™ª

Who are you?

I wanna steal this book.


You should.

They won't miss it.

<i>[radio static]</i>

[indistinct chatter]

Do you hear that?

It's not real.

[indistinct chatter in the distance]

[male #4] Fuck you, asshole!

[chatter continues]

Hey, look, dick, we gave
your cousin his bow-tie back.

Fuck off! You don't wanna
have the deal with us tonight.

Kick these assholes out of here, Joplin.

Fuck you, man!
Hey, hey, hey.

What's going on here?

This isn't your problem, commando.

Why don't you just step...
Hey, hey, hey!

Back up off my friend.

Slow down. I'm begging you please.

[tires screeching]


Take me home.

[breathing heavily]

I'm sorry.

What was that, Spencer?

You freaked out back there.

I'm sorry.
What am I doing?

I don't even know who you are.

That wasn't me.

There's blood on your shirt.


Oh, fuck.

Oh, fuck.

I'm sorry.

I fucked up.

I fucked up.


I fucked up.

I'm fucked up.

I'm fucked up!


I'm so fucked up!

Fuck!

Fuck.



Spencer?

Yeah.

This, uh...

Is this a pretty normal date night for you?

[both chuckle]

Take me somewhere special.

[crickets chirping]

[engine revving]

I've been coming here for 20 summers.

It's just...

...always felt like the place where I'm...

...supposed to be.

I can feel that.

It's, uh...

It's comforting.

Yeah. See, and you've only
been here for 30 seconds.

Yeah, it's comforting and...

...I don't know, I just always
felt drawn to this place.

It's almost perfect.

You wanna try something?
I think so.

It's kinda crazy.

Okay.

I'm ready for that.

[engine turns over]



[Alice screams]

[Alice and Spencer screaming]

Oh!
Oh, my God!

Holy crap! That was amazing!

Paul showed me that!

[both laughing]

I never actually did it myself before.

What? You can't tell me that!


Oh.

[Alice laughs]


This night is perfect.

Would you wanna live here
forever, Spencer Koll?

I could do that...

...Alice...

Shelley.

Shelley.

Do you wanna live here
forever, Alice Shelley?

I want that.

Yes.



<i>[radio static]</i>

<i>[static continues]</i>

[instrumental music]

â™ª Sing to me sweetly â™ª

â™ª I'll shut these sore eyes â™ª

â™ª And carry me on to the night â™ª

â™ª I've got this ghost â™ª

â™ª That just won't let go â™ª

â™ª You've got a way â™ª

â™ª To soothe my soul â™ªâ™ª

I don't ever want to go back.

I wanna stay here... with you...

...forever.

Sounds perfect.

Let's do it again.

You've just got to give
me a minute to reload.


I meant, um...

Oh!

[engine turns over]

[intense music]

Are you ready?

Let's go.

[engine revving]

[Spencer screaming]


[ECG beeping]

There he is, there he is.

He's coming up.

He came up?
Baby.

Hey, Spencer, I'm Doctor Fisk.

I want you to take it easy.

I don't want you to say anything now.

You were in that water
there for quite a bit.

You had a near drowning.

It appears you aspirated
a pretty significant

amount of water that was very cold.

[Dr. Fisk] <i>And we're fortunate
that your body has been trained up</i>

<i>in that sort of thing.</i>

So I just want to ask
you a couple of questions.

What's your name?

Spencer Koll.

Do you know what the date is?

Thursday, I'm not really sure.

Do you know what month it is?

June.
Good.

Who is the President?

Obama.

I think you're gonna do just fine.

I do wanna keep you here

for just a tad longer though, okay, bud?

I wanna keep an eye on the lungs

I wanna do some respiratory monitoring

and then we'll let you go.

Where is...
She'll be down in a minute.

The other nurses let her
know you're here. It's okay.

[Dr. Fisk] Don't over
exert yourself, Spencer.

We need you, so don't go away now.

[woman on PA] Doctor Hartgrove,
please call extension 4408.

Doctor Hartgrove, please
call extension 4408.

How the fuck did we let this happen?

We didn't.

You just don't dwell on it, okay?

Our job right now is to be here.

That's all we can do.
No.

Hey, how is he?

He's, he's alive, you
know. I mean that's good.

Where's everybody else?

Well, they're still passed out.

It was a real shit show.

Yeah.

Emily! Hey, Em...

[woman on PA] Attention please,
will the Garcia family please return

to the ICU.

Garcia family, please return to the ICU.

Hey, Em.

Is he awake?
Yeah. Just. Come on in.

We'll wait outside.

lungs were full of water.


Are you okay?

What were you thinking?

How do I know that you
didn't do this on purpose?

Good question.

What?

[instrumental music]

[breathing deeply] I
can't be here right now.

Spencer, stop it.

Spencer, stop!

<i>Stop!</i>
Let me go.

[instrumental music]


Fuck!

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

Fuck.


[music continues]

Hi.

[music continues]

<i>[Alice laughing]</i>


[both laughing]

Ah!

You're it.
Ah!

No, stop, that is not, that is not fair.

Two-person tag that
doesn't even make sense.

It was your idea.

Well, you should stop listening to me.

I'm pretty sure you're the
first woman in the history

of the world to ever say that.

Just kiss me.

Okay, if I have to.

Can we live here?

maybe, uh, want somewhere

that has, I don't know, a ceiling?

Some walls?
No, what for?

We need our own dog.
That's the first thing.

One, two, three, golden retriever.

Golden retriever.



Spencer, look at me.

Hey, hey.

Sir, you can't leave against
medical adviser not signing...

Where you going?
Excuse me.

I can't be here anymore,
I have things to do.

[Mrs. Koll] What things?
Wait-wait-wait, take it easy.


Let's go, I'll go with you.


Hey, Spencer?

Spencer. Spencer.

What the fuck happened last night?

I killed that girl, man. She was with me.

No one knows she was there, do they?

No man, you zipped off alone last night.

I think you might be a
little loopy right now.

This is exactly what I need.


She wasn't with you, man

so don't beat yourself up about it... okay?

You were a little tipsy, you
were high on fuckin' adrenaline.

The crash messed with your
memory stick, that's all.

Do you have her number?
There are no coincidences.

That's what I've learned.

She found this book at the party.

It was in the library and she recited

every fucking word of it from memory.

Holy Grail.

Destiny kinda shit.

I don't know what you're
talkin' about, man.

Look, I'll-I'll go check at the lake.

I need you to help me maximize
my extended breath-hold.

I'm out of practice.

Hold this.

Spencer, what is going on with you, man?

Press start when I go under.

Spencer!

Spencer! Spencer!

Okay.

Peanut butter... or...

...peanut butter and jelly?

How do you eat a peanut butter sandwich?

Doesn't it stick to your mouth?

I like it.

This jelly is so slimy.

You're slimy.
You're slimy.

No, you literally kinda slimy.


We should make a toast.
What to?


I don't know. You do it.

To long life.

Is that supposed to be ironic?


Okay. Uh, to peace on Earth.

You're boring.

Fine, I don't know.

To boobs.
Boobs?

Well, I guess that's something.

Clink.


Hey, hey.

Breathe.



What was my time?
Fuck you, man. Fuck.

You have to stop it when
I come out of the water!

Goddammit!

What the fuck?

What the fuckin' hell, stuntman.

Yeah, think of all the
times we could have like...

Halloween?

I really don't recall that night.

Well, dude, you were driving.

Well, if you remember it so well

why weren't you drivin'?

I'll punch you in the liver.


Are his parents home? Like,
maybe we should go in to garage.

The whole point was for
us to wait for him here.

Yeah, but if we're smokin',
then maybe we shouldn't do

that in a seedy alley, genius.

Cops patrol back here.

Would you at least grow a right nut, Paul?

Don't have to go for
both, I know that's a lot

to ask from you, but just
invest in half the package...

[knocking on window]

Jesus Christ!
Uh, come on.

You're like the fuckin'
seed of Chucky, man.

You know, Toad's been callin' me.

What the fuck is going on?

Uh, we saw it all. It's fine, okay?

Look, they pulled the car
out, there was no one in there

she couldn't have been with him.

Well, how can you be so sure?
I swear on my life, man.

We just came from there.

Well... then where is she?

Look, we saw him leave, we
didn't see her leave, okay?

What do you think, they had like

a secret rendezvous point or somethin'?

Calm down. It's nothin' to worry about.

Toad said that Spencer said...

Consider tangible evidence
versus the fucked up

post-accident mind of your hero, okay?

He's not working on a practical level.

Don't get on an edge about it.

No, not an edge, I'm
tryin' to figure out...

Chill out, bro, okay?

I'm done with the conspiracy theories.

Let's get some tunes goin'.

[upbeat music on radio]

Oh, you have to kill me.

What... cops?
Uh, girlfriend.

Oh! Crap, hide.

Let's hide.
Where do you wanna hide?

What, the glove compartment or somethin'?

Hey, you guys, come on.
Alright.

Oh. Hey.

Hey, guys.
Hey.

Hey, Emily.

We didn't even see you there.


Uh, no, uh, we're waiting
for him, he's still with Toad.

He told you to say that?

No.
No, it's true.

Why did you guys leave
him alone last night?

We didn't.

Ask Cooper, he'll tell you all about Alice.

You, idiot.

That's not a thing. I don't know
what I'm talking about. I'm...

I'm kidding. Cooper's such a nut.

Who's Alice?

Look, Em, we don't wanna
get in the middle of this?

Too late now, Cooper.

How you doin', Em?
Who's Alice?

I'm gonna take off with these guys.

up? Everything alright?

No, not really.
What happened at the lake?

Took a look around. She's not there.

Spencer was saying to me.

Spencer.

Okay, I just need to say this.

I've been thinking, and I
can't pretend like I'm not angry

and you need to understand that
I have every right to be angry.

I wanna give you whatever
space it is that you're needing

but I also wanna be there for you

because you clearly cannot
be here for yourself.

So let's just start with you doing

a much better job of talking to me.

[breathing heavily]

[timer beeps]

What are you doing?

I broke my record.

Are you even listening to me?

Most of the time.

Spencer, I'm trying to tell
you that I think you need help.

Yes, will you time me?

Who's Alice?

Where did you meet her?

At work.
When?

I don't know, what's the day.

Did you know her before
you broke up with me?

I didn't break up with you.
God, God, don't say that.

It makes it worse.

Did you know her?
Yes.

Did you sleep with her?
Em...

Don't act like it's not
an important question.

I didn't say no. Can't you just...

Can't you just what?

Figure it out, stupid girlfriend
or sometimes-girlfriend

or whatever it is that I am?

My God, Spencer, you were so good

and now lying and not
telling the truth all at once.

It's just a thing that happened.

So that's it?

You come back and it's
like five years together

that's just gone?

You had your freedom, and now you come back

and you're some kinda guy that
takes random girls to parties?

You don't think that I
know that I fucked up.

Whatever I'm feeling it's not about you.

The whole thing has nothing to do with you.

And you see this one. Did
he take out that tree too?

That's what it did to the car.

Where were you?
Spencer?

Sit down!
Hello, Spencer, how are ya?


I understand you had a bit
of an accident last night.

Yes, sir.

The main thing is we
just wanna get you back

where you need to be.

What if you get called back?

Your country and-and our family

need you to be ready for that.

Listen, now-now legally

you're just lookin' at
damage to the guard rail

a few private trees, things
like that, simple stuff.

No real harm done there.

But we know about the boy at the party.

Cell phone videos, all that.

Family lawyer has got in touch with us.

Now, luckily there's no brain damage.

Gonna be some reconstructive
surgery necessary.

I think it's much better...

...if we just sweep it
away, settle out of court.

Your parents and I'll
pay off all the bills.

[muffled voice] And you are gonna work off

every last cent, you understand me?


We can deal with that later.

I think what's much more important here

is that everyone's concerned about you.

The way I see it, Spencer,
the only way out is through.

Your parents are here, your
friends, they can all help.

But you're gonna have
to just look this thing

right in the face and deal with it.

Be a man. Say your I'm sorrys.

And move on.

This isn't a damn game.

Didn't they teach you discipline?

[knocking on window] Josh, please.

Spence, let's go.

[Mrs. Koll] Guys, no, not now. Not now.

You know, what, these
guys need to understand

the gravity of the situation.

They're half the problem.

Let's go, guys, come on.
Hey!

Come on, this way.
Come on.

We're getting out of here.


[instrumental music]


This is like the best day ever.

What is this?

I've got a surprise for you.

Where?

[instrumental music]


[people cheering]

[both chuckling]

This is heaven?

Or a dream?

Is this the book?

Alice, uh, are these people from the book?

Come on, you know the answer.

[both chuckle]

Just stop asking questions.

It's just a place like any other.

But can it last forever?

Can anything?

If you don't let it
end, it doesn't have to.


It'll never have to.

Right?

Only question you should be asking...


...is where should I be right now.

I know the answer.

Here.

With you.

[instrumental music]

I'm-I'm-I'm
starting to feel

like that might not be a victory, Spencer.

Why don't you wanna be back

with all those people
who are waiting for you?

Oh, I can't.
Why?

Because...

...I've...

...I've done things.

What-what-what
things?

Terrible things.

Spencer...
I can't breathe up there.

They never found my body, did they?

Spencer, oh my God.

Breathe. Breathe!

Wake up, breathe.


Mom?

Spencer, wake up.
No, no, let be back.

No, Spencer. Spencer!
Let be back.

Spencer, if you father sees you

doing this, he'll go crazy.

Look at me! Look at me.

Oh, baby.


Here, Spencer.
No, no.

I can't stay here.
Stop!

Spencer, stop it!
I can't stay here.

Please let me help you.


Spencer? Spencer?

Let's go. Come on, man.

Stop, stop.

Just stop, stop. Let's slow down.

Just slow everything down.
What for?

What for? Come on, you're
so intense right now.

Let's just... take a deep breath

and talk about where we go from here.

That's the theme of the day.

Yeah, well, do you
realize what you just did?

I broke five minutes, man.

The Submarine Kid broke twenty.

hold her breath forever.

Spencer, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

Just more practice then
I can stay with her!

Stop thinking about this shit! Quit it!

Let's just take your brother,
we can go to Nathan's.

On the way at least we
can get a case of beer

and a sack of weed and
fucking relax and talk about.

No, man! Let me do this!

Do what? Wait.

What are you doing?



[timer beeps]

Not good enough.


[instrumental music]

This can't be fucking happening.

No, no, no.

Fuck!

Fuck! What the fuck!

What the fuck!


Goddammit!

Goddammit! Let me back!




[music continues]


Fuck, Spencer!


I'm sorry, Marc.

I'm so fucking sorry.

This isn't about you.

I shouldn't have brought this here.

Don't apologize for this.

Can you talk to me?

What do you want me to say?

Just tell me the truth.

The only easy day was yesterday.

No, man, no bullshit.

I want the truth.

[instrumental music]


It's a book about me.

Spencer...

...I know you won't believe
me, but whatever this is

it's not your story.

You think you're escaping
the bullshit with this

but you're just going farther into it.

You're lost.

I was just like you. I
came back, I was a shell.

I had to retrace the steps.

It's hard work.

I know how tempting it looks...

...but just getting
out is not real freedom.

Obsessing over this kind of shit

is just an escape.

Deal...

...with what's real.

Tell me what's going on.

Spencer?

[instrumental music]

[door opens]


Did they hear me?
No.

This came for you.

It's from the marines.

You can open it.

Don't look up to me.

[music continues]

Are you okay?

Toad's coming to get us.

Get ready.

Where are we going?

[music continues]

This is my favorite place in the world.


This is my favorite place in the world.

Do you hear that?

You're my favorite place
in the whole fucking world!

You're almost perfect, you fucking lake!

[Howie howling]

â™ª Balls so hard
motherfuckers wanna find me â™ª

â™ª But first they gotta find me â™ªâ™ª

Look who worked off his hangover.

Yeah, took all fucking day.

Well, I'm here.

Take the beer.
Give me the beer.

Alright, guys, listen up.

I don't wanna get all
cheesy fucking sentimental

with you guys, but you are my brothers.

And I've been thinking ever
since this sister got back.

And no matter what the fuck happens...

...you know, no matter
how crazy this world gets

you guys are the one thing that I've got

that's never going away.

And God help me for the grief
I'm gonna suffer for this

but I fuckin' love each and
every one of you, alright?


[timer beeping]

Hey, come on.

Good girl.
Hey.

Hey, let's build a house.

I know how to do it.

We can't stay here.

I know everything.

I saw what happened to you.

I don't care.

You want me to be like him?

I am.

I can show you.

We can stay here.

Spencer, there's roads
waiting for both of us.

It won't be like this forever.

I love you.

The worst is almost over

and then we'll have perfection.

Look around.

Perfection.

Right?



You can't hide from her with me.

Wait.

Wait.



Hey, ten minutes and
fourteen seconds, dude.



He almost drowned in the sink right there.

This is not fucking okay.
Chill out, he's fine.

We were with him the whole time.

He's not fucking fine, Nick.

Does he look fucking fine to you?

He's coughing water all
over the fucking floor.

Stop, come on, come
on, come on, stop, stop.


Did you say ten minutes?
Hell, yeah, bro.

But I'm not sure it should
count since your ass passed out.

Fucking idiots. Come on, get up.

Well, what do you guys say?

Huh? Huh? Am I in line?

Let's check with the Russian judge.

Fuck off, Howie!

It's not funny!

Wow, he was actually mad.

I knew comin' up here was a bad idea.

Yo, what, hey.

What if he really just died right now?

I'd feel bad about that?
You-you'd feel bad about that?

You're the master of the
understatement, Howie.

Fuck!



he was trying to drown himself?

[upbeat music]

What the hell is matter with you?

I'm in love.

With something that's fake.

It's fake, it's a figment
of your imagination.

Can't you just...

...see her in your dreams or somethin'?


That's stupid.

No, what's fuckin' stupid
is you dunkin' your head

in sinks and having people time you.

That's fucking stupid.

It's a matter of opinion, man.

Spencer...

...you're scaring me.

You are playing some kind of game with God.

And if you keep going on like this...

...you're never gonna come up.

Fuck, man, draw a picture of her.

Or write a story, so
that maybe I can meet her

but just-just fucking stop this.

Stop it.


Spencer, you realize there's
people that actually need you...

...right?

What do you want?

I mean you wanna go away?

You wanna leave this place then do it, go.

But don't leave your life, I mean...

...do you hear the way
that kid talks to you?

Yeah.

Good. Hear it.

Because we all feel that way.

We all love you, Spencer.

Now, look me in the eye

and tell me that you're
not gonna disappear.

I'm not gonna disappear.

Don't fuck with me, man, I trust you.

Clink, bitch.

Hmm. Alright.

[man on TV] You can say that,
but what is his team going to do?

They have no identity. They
have no identity at all.

What I'm concerned about is
really the outfield player.

I mean, if-if he, if he can't get guys...

[door opens]

[indistinct chatter on TV]

[man on TV] It doesn't make any sense, Jim.

It doesn't, it doesn't make any sense.


Okay, they-they've got...

[man on TV] Well, that's my
point exactly, Tim, I mean...

[dramatic music]

[helicopter whirring]

[man on radio] Talon-11
Actual, Eagle-11 Actual

No joy under HVT, he's gone to ground.

Uh, move out the extract
towards Oscar Mike over.

Roger that.

Talon Actual out.

Fuck this day.

So when we get back to base,
the next round's on you.

Round's on your mom.

My mom will kick your ass, bro.

Your mom could kiss my ass.

[leaves rustling]

Shit!

Eagle-11, Talon Actual, we have
eyes on targets of opportunity.

...we are weapons-free, over

[man on radio] Talon-11, take the shot.

[radio static] Take the shot.

Fucking...
What's the plan, boss?

Eagle-11, let's take it, let's take it.

[indistinct radio chatter]

Roger that, weapons free.
'Weapons free.'

[man on radio] Do not take the shot.

I say again, do not take the shot.


[shouting indistinctly]


[intense music]


Come on, let's go!

Let's go now!



[shouting indistinctly]


Talon One is compromised.

Redirect for immediate medevac.

Position... one click south of original.

[indistinct chatter]

Let's get him out of here. Let's go.

Let's go. Move it, move it.

[dramatic music]


[water gushing]

Hey, Spencer?

Oh, shit.

Toad, Toad, Toad.

Toad, Toad, wake up.

Yo, read this, dude.

Wake up, man, he's out.

He's out, man. It's over, he's discharged.

Spencer?
Where are you?


you? It's time to celebrate.


Spence?

Spence?

Oh, shit!
Spencer!

Man, have you seen Spencer?

Check it out, man, he's done.

He's in the fucking lake.

[instrumental music]

Spencer!


Spencer!

No! Let me go! Spencer!

No, no, stay here.
Spencer!

Spencer!

[music continues]

[male #10] Spencer!

Spencer!

Fuck!

Spencer!

Fuck, man!

Spencer!
Spencer!

Oh, fuck! Fuck!

Fuck!

Spencer!

I've been working on something for you.

I've been training myself

like the kid did.

This way we could be together forever.

We can't do this anymore.

This has to be goodbye.

What do you want me to do, pretend

I'm in love with someone else?

I want you to stop pretending.

I stopped.

I pretended you were him, but you're not.

I'm becoming him.

Isn't that what you want?

It's not enough.

You see, you see this dress

this, this place...

...none of this belongs to you.

It...

...belongs to him.

I thought I could stop waiting

and find someone else

but it doesn't work that way, Spencer.

But he didn't die.

He went off to find something better.

Just like me.
No!

I waited.

I waited and I never got an answer.

I tried to make you into what I needed.

But it's not real.

But I can prove it to you.

I tried to be something else for you.

Just like you're trying to be for me.

But it's a mistake.

I'm not the thing you
needed so badly to want.

Give me my peace, Spencer.

It's the only thing, that'll save us both.

Just...

It's a fresh start when I go under.

You'll see so clearly this is all real.

It's everything we both wanted.

[instrumental music]

Go!

[music continues]

[timer beeping]


Somebody call fucking help!

How the hell did this happen?
How did you let this happen?


Huh? What was I supposed to do?

We need to get back out
there, we need to find him.

Ah! He promised me that
he wasn't gonna disappear.

Don't be stupid.

You are such idiots, you let him

jump in the fucking lake!

I hate this stupid, fucking lake!

Emily.

Come on, come on.

[instrumental music]

[timer beeping]

[beeping continues]

Ah! Alice, stop the watch.

I know that was my best time yet.


I counted to at least...

What?
