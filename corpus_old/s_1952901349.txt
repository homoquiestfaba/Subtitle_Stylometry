What do you think of
my latest masterpiece, Eliot?

I know it isn't
one of my best.

But it does remind me of
how pretty it was back here.

Oh, things are fine.

But I do miss you, Eliot.

[Elevator dings]

Good morning.

Mr. Eason, you're late.
Here's your mail.

Any calls?

Your mother... Twice.

Uh, Mr. Weller again.
He wasn't too thrilled

About the fact that
you never called him back.

Anything else?

And Mr. Backis
is waiting for you.

Richard, I know
that our bank

Has been doing business
with your father

And his company
for 50 years.

But we're, um...

Concerned about the
scope of this project.

Everything is going
according to plan so far.

Well, Richard, the board
approved the project

With your father
at the helm.

Since his passing,

There has been
the question of...

Whether I'm up
to the task.

Your father had
decades of experience,

And that experience is
what got this project
off the ground.

Since my father died,
we're on schedule

To break ground in
three weeks with no delays.

<i>[Intercom buzzes]</i>
<i>woman: Mr. Eason?</i>

<i>It's your mother, Richard.</i>

Well, have her
call me back.

<i>Honey, this is the third</i>
<i>time she's called.</i>

<i>She says that</i>
<i>it's important.</i>

<i>I think you should</i>
<i>take the call.</i>

Ok, put her through.
This will just take
a second.

Mom, I'm really busy.
<i>I need a favor.</i>

This new easel
isn't working for me,

And my old one's
up in the garage attic.

I can't right now.

I'm in the middle of
a very important meeting.

Ok, I'll just
go get it myself.

<i>But if I fall...</i>

If I break my hip--

Mom, I'm gonna have
to call you back.
<i>Fine.</i>

And don't climb
up that ladder.

Bye.

%% Find that someone special %%

%% give him love,

Hmm.

[Musical cell phone ring]

Hello?

Ella bear? It's grandma.

Hi, grandma, how are you?

You won't believe
what your father did.

<i>My guess is it's more of</i>
<i>what he didn't do.</i>

<i>I can't paint</i>
<i>with this new easel,</i>

The one your father
bought me.

And my old one is way up
in the garage attic,

And he says he's
too busy to come get it

For his own mother.

Yeah, grandma, I don't know
what you want me to do.

It'd take me a couple
of hours to get there.

Damn easel!

I never expected to be
a struggling artist

At my age.


That was a joke.

What's the matter?

Are you sure
everything's ok?

Yeah.

How are your classes?

They're ok.

You're doing well?

Yeah, my grades are fine.

Are you still
writing songs down

In that book of yours?

Sort of.

You sound so sad,
Ella bear.

Grandma--

Look, Ella,
there's no one
keeping you there.

<i>You can do</i>
<i>whatever you want.</i>

The world is open to
all of your dreams.

Whatever that means.
Thanks.

Bye.

[Phone beeps]

Mom?

Mom?

[Thud, clanging]


Mom, I told you not--

Not to climb the ladder.

Your father
isn't around anymore,

And you're too busy,

So how was I supposed
to get my easel?

Plus I found this painting
of Annie's point.

That's great. Now,
get off the ladder
before you hurt yourself.

I still have to get
my easel.

Get off. Step off.

I'll get it.

Come on.

Be careful.

Mom, why are you
limping?

I'm fine.

You could've fallen
off the ladder

And killed yourself.

I didn't fall, and
I'm still on the earth.

Now, will you please
just go up and get
my easel?

I always meant
to finish this one.

I know this is a very
difficult time for you.

But I can't be with you
24 hours a day.

I was asking
for five minutes.

Can't an old woman
get any help around
the house?

How would you feel about
getting an apartment?

Or one of those condos
down by the lake?

This place appraised
for much higher than
you expected.

Your father would
never hear of it.

Mom, this house
is too big for you.

It's my home.

Well, the yard's a mess.

And you left the stove on
twice last week.

Don't speak
to me that way!
I'm your mother.

I'm trying
to be helpful.

No, you're not.

Your father and I
built this house,

And I want
to stay here.

This just
isn't practical.

But I feel
comfortable here.

Mom--
that's enough, Richard!

I'm fine, and I'm not
going anywhere.

Now, if you have
a problem with that,

You should take it up
with your father.

[Playing guitar and humming]


So, what do you
think, mom?

Nursing school or
a songwriting career?

Everybody else seems
to have an opinion.

Here you are.

Thank you.

Oh, Louise!
You won't believe

What I found
in the attic.

My unfinished painting
of Annie's point.

Annie's point? Oh!

That's the place where
you and Eliot wanted
to build a house.

Oh, not just
a house.

Our <i>dream</i> house.

Come on, sweetheart.

We never got to it.

No.

[Dog groans]

I sat in that
hospital room with
Eliot for months.

And then, just a few
minutes before he passed,

He told me his one wish--

To be set free
at Annie's point

On our 50th anniversary.

You have an anniversary
coming up, don't you?

In nine days.

What's holding you back?

You're thinking of
dropping out of college?

Do you have some
sort of plan that
I don't know about?

I want to pursue
a songwriting career.

Ella, you're gonna have
lots and lots of time

For hobbies
and stuff like that
after you graduate.

Right now you've got
to have your degree.

Where did this
songwriting idea
come from, anyway?

I never heard you
sing a note.

Mom did.
Oh.

I see.
Well, trust me--

Even if your mother
was still alive,

You would not
be doing this.

You don't know that.

I've already paid
the tuition,

So please finish out
this year.

Dad, I can't.

Do you have any idea
how much it costs

For me to send you
to this place?

Yeah, I do.
But you don't know
what it's like for me.

Come on, Ella!
It's school!
It's not prison!
Dad!

I know you're going
through some sort of
teenage crisis,

But I am not gonna
let you throw away
your future

To follow some
stupid fantasy!

I knew you wouldn't
understand.

You don't care
about my feelings.

All you care about
is this stupid company.

You don't know what
you're talking about.

This stupid
company is--

Grandma said there was
nothing keeping me there,

And you know what?
She was right.

[Door slams]

Got good news
and bad news.

Your echocardiogram
showed significant blockage
on two of your arteries.

I certainly hope
that's the bad news.

It is.
The good news is,

With a fairly
routine bypass,

You'll be as good
as new. But--

I've never been sick
a day in my life.

But, to be honest,

After watching Eliot
in that hospital
all those months,

I never want to
set foot in one again.

I understand.

But this is
a serious situation.

Without the operation--

I could die?
Yes.

You could die.

We need to get you
into the hospital
as soon as possible.

Can I have
a day or two

Before I commit
to a surgery date?

Sure.

In the meantime,
we need to get you going

On a new blood pressure
medication.

It could make you feel
a little lightheaded
at first,

So try to take it easy.

Can I drive?
I wouldn't recommend it.

At least
not for a while.

Sorry about that, everybody.
What did I miss?

I was just telling
your mother--

I'll fill him in later.
Come on, dear.

Annie... Remember.

With this new medication,

No driving if
you feel lightheaded.

Thank you, doctor.

[Guitar playing]

[song ends]


Let's hear it again
for Kim Bobletta!

And now please
welcome... Ella.


Sorry. Whoops.

Are you sure Dr. Meldon
didn't say anything else?

It's just blood pressure
medication?

That's all.

But, now that
I can't go alone,

I need you to make
that trip with me.

Mom, that's
2,000 Miles away.

I've got a great car.

I can't do this
right now, mom.

I told you,
there's too much
going on at work.

As soon as
the project is over,

I'll take you there
myself.

That might be too late.

Too late for what?
Mom, what are you
not telling me?

Nothing. But with
the wedding anniversary
coming up--

I'll take you to a nice
dinner to celebrate your
wedding anniversary.

Why don't--oh!

Annie: Oh, my!

Mom!

What if I hadn't
been here?

What would you have done?

Ok, that's it.
You can't stay here
anymore.

This is not just
for my peace of mind.

It's for your safety.

What if you got someone
to stay with me?

For how long?
That's really expensive.

Your father and I
built this house

With our bare hands.

It's all I've got left.

He was my best friend.

We did everything
together.

We were supposed to leave
this earth together.

If I move to that place,
will you make me a promise?

Anything.

You have to take me
to Annie's point. Please.

I already told you,
as soon as--

I need a promise.
I promise.

And it has to be
all of us--
you and me and Ella.

Ok.
And we have to drive.

It'll force you
to spend time with Ella,

Get to know
each other again,

Get to be friends again.

Mom...
Whatever you want.

I've got to go
back to work, ok?

Just call me
if you need anything.

And no stoves,
all right?

I'll see you.

Dad?

Oh!
I'm sorry.

Oh, you should not
sneak up on me.

Dad, I said
I was sorry.

Yeah, but what
I'm telling you--
dad!

It's all right.
What do you need,
honey?


Do you like
construction?

Uh... Sure.

Did grandpa make you
work with him?

No. No, I think he just
always wanted me to...

Do whatever
made me happy.

He did say his door
would always be open,

And then one day
I just walked in. Why?

Just asking, I guess.

Mom would've been
46 tomorrow.

I know.

Remember the 40th
birthday party
we threw for her?

The surprise party?

Oh, some surprise.
She knew.

Yeah, but she pretended
that she didn't.

Out of all the places
we could've gone,

She wanted to go...

Roller skating.

My knees have never
been the same.

Dad?

I really don't think
that I'm making a mistake.

To tell you the truth,
I'm not really sure
what you're doing.

I know I have
some talent with music.

I just don't know--

[cell phone rings]

Sorry.

Hello?

Oh, yes, Mr. Backis.

No, no. We've avoided
that with Mr. Nucci.

Tomorrow? Um...

I'm supposed
to bring my mother

To a retirement
community tomorrow.

Mr. Backis, can I
call you back?

Thank you.

Ok, bye.

Do you want me
to go with grandma

To her new place?

It's not just
the work, Ella.

It's...

I understand.
I'll go with her.

Annie: I don't know
if Richard's gonna
keep his promise.

Maybe I should just
pack the car up

And head out
to Annie's point.

It's ridiculous,
isn't it?

I know I made
that promise to you.

I'm just not sure
how I'm going to
pull it off.

Well, we'll talk
more about this
in the morning.

Good night, my love.

You have all your pills?

Yes, Richard.

I wish I could drive you
to the orientation.

That's ok.

It's just that
I canceled on these
guys yesterday.

I said it's ok.

I know this is
all happening
really fast,

But you're gonna
like the place,
I know you will.

And just think--
you're gonna be

Practically neighbors
with Louise.

I'm gonna be fine.

Are you gonna be
ok to drive?

Ella's here.
I'll be fine.

Richard: All right.
So, I'll, uh...

I'll stop in later tonight
to get you settled.

Thank you.

You're a good son.

Thanks, mom.

Hey.

Make a right here,
grandma.

Gramm, you were supposed
to turn right there.

I probably should've
told your father.

I'm not moving in
there today.

What are you
talking about?

I thought about it.
I did.

But I truly
can't remember

What Annie's point
looked like.

And I need to be there
for my anniversary.

I'm going to California.

And I need you
to go with me.

What?
We're going
to California.

I can't.

Give me one
good reason why not.

My father.

Oh, I can handle him.

What are you gonna do,
stay here, pay rent,

Mope around? You want
to be a songwriter.

You have to have
something to write about.

It's not that easy.

You wouldn't want me to
drive there by myself,
would you?

That's not fair.

I'm an old lady.

I'd be all alone
for 2,000 Miles.

And all I have
is an old map.

Grandma!

I'm also on this
new medication.

I'm not even sure
I can drive on my own.

I don't have my guitar
or any of my clothes.

Oh, we can get those.

I have plenty of cash.

And there are always
credit cards.

Thank you, Ella bear.

Come on, Ella.

Let's live a little.

I thought you said
you couldn't drive.

It's just a little
further up this way.

Put that book down
for a second,

And grab that
small painting
behind your seat.

We weren't
much older than you

When grandpa moved us
from California

For a job he just
couldn't pass up.

We didn't have
a penny to our name.

But we had the world
in front of us.

And those trees.

They were like
a row of soldiers
welcoming us home.

What did you leave
back in California?

Everything.

My parents,
my baby brother,
you name it.

What happened with
your little brother?

We'll have plenty
of time for that.

If I'm not mistaken,
this should be it.

Ella: What happened
to the trees?

This is it.

Grandma,
this is stupid.

We can just barge in
on some strangers.

It'll be fine.

People are nicer
than you think.

I'll do the talking.

Good, 'cause I don't
want to be here.


Gotcha!

Uh...

Who are you?

Is your mother
or father home?

Mom?!

Two strange ladies
are here!

That's a good start.

I'm leaving.
Uh--

Can I help you?
Hi.

My name is Annie Eason,

And this is
my granddaughter Ella.

Can I help you?

I know this is gonna
sound unusual, but...

My husband and I
built this house
years ago,

And I was wondering
if it would be possible...

For me to have
a look inside.

We should be going.
Sorry to bother you.

You see,
we left something

Behind the nook
in the kitchen, for luck.

Would it be all right
for me to see

If it's still there?

I don't know.

Mrs. Hogan...
My granddaughter and I

Are on a Journey
across the country,

And I have
a heart problem.

So I figured we could
use all the luck
we could get.

We built the house
in 1960.

How long have you
been living here?

[Baby crying]

Um, five years
this July.

I hope you don't
mind my asking--

What happened
to those beautiful
trees out front?

This is how the house
came to us.

Are--are you sure
you know what
you're looking for?

Annie: I'm sure.

Mrs. Hogan:
Oh, my goodness.

Ella: What is that?

Annie: A 1919
gold Liberty coin...

Given to your grandfather
by his father.

When we left California,
he said,

"hide it someplace
in your first home,

And it'll bring you
a lifetime of happiness."

We call it lucky 19.

Just before he passed,
your grandfather said

He realized this coin
needed to come back
to the family.

Houses don't need luck.
People do.

Margaret, I cannot
thank you enough

For allowing us
in your home.

It's my pleasure.

Hold on a second.

I want you
to have this.

This isn't
<i>this</i> house, is it?

It sure is.

There used to be
trees here.

It was so beautiful.

I can't accept this.

Oh, it would mean
a great deal to me

If you could use
some of that money to
plant some new trees.

I can't.

I insist.

Thank you again.

No. Thank <i>you.</i>

[Baby crying]

Oh... There he is again.

I'm so sorry.
Have a great trip.

Sam!

I can't believe you just
gave her all that money.

Oh, your grandfather
would want the house

To look like it did
when we were younger.

Besides, it makes
you feel good

To do things
for other people.

Whatever.

And what did you mean
when you said

You had a heart problem?

Didn't I tell you?

Um... I need
bypass surgery.

What?!

Why wouldn't you
tell me that?

You wouldn't have
agreed to come
with me if I had.

Besides,
I feel great.

<i>[Rock music on radio]</i>

[turns radio off]

Do you have
a boyfriend?

No.

Had many dates lately?

No.

In my day...

A man would take you
to the movies,

Or for a soda,

And if he
interested you,

You'd spend
some time together.

But after a few months,

If he wasn't serious
about marriage,

You'd move on
to a man who was.

Kind of sounds like
an arranged marriage.

in lots of ways, it was.

Your grandpa
asked me to marry him

On our fifth date.

Women didn't have
the freedom that you have.

Some freedom. I've never
been on a second date,

Let alone a fifth.

You are a beautiful,
talented young woman.
Why not?

I'd rather not discuss
my love life

With my grandma.

Doesn't sound like
there <i>is</i> a love life.

Even more reason
to end the discussion.

So, to answer
your question, no.

No one is "courting me"
at the moment.

<i>%% ...The earth was</i>
<i>nowhere to be found %%</i>

<i>%% and the view from-- %%</i>

Why do you think you
don't have a boyfriend?

Grandma, please!

It's like with my music.

I'm in my room,
and I'm fine.

But you get me in front
of a crowd, and I freeze.

Same thing with guys.

I get totally terrified
when I talk to them.

You're just
not flirting enough.

I don't know
how to flirt.

Nonsense. Everyone
knows how to flirt.

Not me.

<i>[Country music playing]</i>

Whatever.

Mom?

[Phone ringing]

There are people here,

Oh, come on, girl.
Live it up.

Oh, this is
so embarrassing.

Please sit down.

Put down that notebook
for five minutes

And live a little.

This notebook
is my life.

What are you writing?

A song. What else
would I be writing?

How am I
supposed to know?

You never let anyone
look at that thing.

What's the song about?
Nothing.

Sounds like a hit.

May I see it?

I'd rather not.

Oh, please, come on.

These are great.

None of them
are done yet.

How does this one go?

I'm not gonna sing
for you.

Then I will.

%% When you find that

I'll tell you what--
I'd buy it.

You ladies have a
lovely evening.

Now, those were
real men.

And they really
liked your style.

Heh!

And it's good
to see you smile.


[cell phone ringing]

It's my dad.

He had to call
sometime.

I don't know how to
use these things!

Press the green button.


Hello?

Mom? Where are you?

I'm not telling.

Mom, I talked
to Dr. Meldon.

I know about the surgery.
This is serious.

You cannot just
pick up and leave.

I can,
and I did.

Is Ella with you?
<i>She sure is.</i>

When are you
coming home?

We're not.

<i>Be reasonable.</i>
<i>You're sick.</i>
I feel fine.

I cannot go chasing
all over the country
for you.

<i>Then don't.</i>

I'm sorry
I lied to you,

But I--I didn't know
any other way.

Please don't do this.

<i>We love you,</i>
<i>and we'll call you</i>
<i>tomorrow.</i>

And don't sell
my house!

'Cause I'm not
moving.

<i>[Click]</i>

He's gonna be mad.

He already is.


Hello?

Yes. Yes, good evening.

Um... I need
a bit of assistance.

Annie: I'm getting
a little tired.

I think I'll
let you drive.

Let's find
an ATM machine.

What's your pin?

Take a guess.

19?

1919. You got it.


You don't have
any money.

Try it again.


Same thing.

Well, it must be
the machine.

What happened?

My credit card
was declined, too.

I just gave him
our last $25 for gas.

You're kidding, right?

No, Ella, I'm not.

Great. We have no money
to get across country...

But that poor family
has $500 to buy trees

That they're never
gonna plant!

Stop it, Ella.

We're in a bit of
a pickle, that's all.

That's it.
I'm calling my dad.

Save your breath.
I'll call him.


[phone beeps]

[cell phone ringing]

Mom?

Just because you
don't agree with me,

You don't have to
sabotage our trip.

Tell me where you are,

And I'll reactivate
your credit cards.

You can't reactive it.

I <i>have to</i>
<i>reactivate it.</i>

In person.
You know that.

What was I
supposed to do?

Honor the dying wish
of your father.

Mom, I want you
to turn around
and come back home.

To what home?

I'm in good company.
I'm not coming back.

Are you at least taking
your medication?

If you're so concerned
about me,

How come you're
leaving me penniless?

Tell me where you are,
and I'll wire you
some money.

Oh, nice try.

Ok, may I please
speak with Ella?

She's not here.

<i>Richard:</i>
<i>Where is she?</i>

She's out getting
a gigantic tattoo

Of a dragon
on her back.

Ella wouldn't do that.
<i>Yes, she would.</i>

And I'm getting
a skull and crossbones
on my butt.

<i>Mom, are you</i>
<i>coming home or not?</i>

<i>Not. It's lucky for you</i>
<i>we're flesh and blood...</i>

Because what you've done
is almost unforgivable.

[Hangs up]

Why did you do that?!

Because I'm
a grown woman

Who can take care
of herself.

Now, get driving,
Ella bear.

We have to make
some money.

No, my dad is right.
You need surgery,

And we don't
have any money.
We have to go back.

Eliot, I made you
a promise.

And nothing is going
to stand in the way
of my keeping it.

You can count on me.

Ella, I'm making it
to Annie's point,
with or without you.

If you want to come
with me,

You're gonna have to
play by my rules.

Woman: Could you
please pick up?

This is important.
Pick up for one sec.

Brenda,
something's come up.
I have to leave town.

I'm gonna have both
cell phones with me.

But don't use
the personal number

Unless you
absolutely have to,

And transfer all
my business calls

To the business
number. Got it?

Honey, I've been here
for eight years.

I think I've got it.
Where are you going?

I'm not quite sure.
But I need you to
do me another favor.

Could you find out
where the last place

That credit card
number was used?

And you've got to call
Backis and Weller

And tell them I can't
make today's appointment.

You can tell them
yourself.

I was trying to tell you--
they're here early.

Man: I've been here
a lot longer than I planned,

But I want those contracts
on my desk by 4:00.


Mr. Backis.

Mr. Weller,
I am terribly sorry.

But we're gonna have to
postpone today's meeting.

Something's come up,
and I have to leave town.

Richard, let me
level with you.

Eason's line of credit

Is what we call
in the banking industry
"guarded".

Well, I'll take that
into consideration.

Now, if you'd like to
make a new appointment,

You can do that
with my assistant.

And, again, my apologies
for the inconvenience.

Uh, Mr. Eason? Are you
still going out of town?

Absolutely.

You gonna stay mad at me
the entire trip?

I can go longer than
you can without talking.

We'll start right now.

No one is talking.

Over 1,000 Miles to go,

And no one is talking.

Oh, we're smiling now.

But no one is talking.

You couldn't go
five minutes
without talking.

And you can't
stay mad at me.

I'm sorry I raised
my voice back there, but...

This trip is
more important to me

Than I can truly
put into words.

Do you understand?

I'm getting hungry.

Park the car.
I have an idea.

Ok, what's
your big idea?

I'll take your arm,

And you tell them
I'm a blind
caricature artist.

What?! No way.
That's crazy.

You want
to eat tonight?

Ok,
watch your step.

Hi. Lovely day
for a fair, isn't it?

Oh, it sure is, sir.

Oh. She doesn't
see too well.

Or... Really at all.

Excuse me.

Could I...

Oh.

From the contours
of your face,

I'd say you were Irish.

That's right.

How do you do that?

Ok, grandma.

There's no entrance fee
for this,

But we do request
a $5 donation, please.

Oh, we're not here
to shop.

I'm an artist.

She does caricatures.

But... But...

She can't see.

But that's
the beauty of it.

[Overlapping chatter
and laughter]

Here you are, son.
Thanks.

Man: That's amazing.

Oh, you don't know
the half of it.

Thank you.

How many is that?
16.

Who's next?

Ella bear...

That voice of yours
is really something.

That was the first time
I sang for anybody

Besides my mom.

Have you written
any songs for her?

Actually, that's
what I'm working on
right now.

Does it help?

With what?

Does it help you...
You know...

When you're feeling
down about her?

I don't know.

You know what I do

When I'm especially blue
about grandpa?

I talk to him.

Yeah, I--

I heard you
in the car.

I'm not embarrassed. I--

Sometimes I talk
about normal stuff--

My day...

My feelings.

Does it help?

Sometimes.

It makes me feel like
he's still with me.

Richard: Yes,
I'm aware of the fact

That they're not
technically missing.

I have their
itinerary with me.

<i>Man: Sir, they're</i>
<i>adults, not kids.</i>

Yes, I'm aware of
the fact that they're
too old to be runaways.

<i>Well, we don't</i>
<i>have the authority--</i>

What do you
suggest we do?

Wait until they break
the law or something?

<i>Let's hope it doesn't</i>
<i>come to that.</i>

Ok, thank you.
Thank you very much.

Same to you. Good-bye.

[Cell phone rings]

Hey, Brenda.
What did you find out?

<i>The card was last</i>
<i>used in Missouri.</i>
Missouri?!

Did Mr. Nucci call
to harass me, too?

Would you do me
a favor and get him
on the line, please?

<i>Don't forget to eat.</i>
Thank you. What?

<i>I said,</i>
<i>don't forget to eat.</i>

Yes. Yes, I'll remember
to eat something.

<i>Ok.</i>
Ok.

<i>Ok. 'Cause you</i>
<i>know what, sweetheart?</i>

<i>You are like a toothpick.</i>
<i>I mean, personally,</i>

<i>I like a man with</i>
<i>a little more meat</i>
<i>on his bones.</i>

Annie:
Did you know,

After all those years
of painting,

Today was the first time
I've ever actually
sold something?

Really?

I think we've done
quite a bit of living

In the last
couple of days.

How are you feeling?

I'm feeling
the same as I was

When you asked me
ten minutes ago.

That's why
I have these.

How did you know
grandpa was the one?

He touched my hand.

And?

Ella bear...

When your grandpa
touched my hand
for the first time,

I had to
actually look down

To see if it was
still there.

I knew right then.

That's it?

That sounds like
something out of
a cheesy romance novel.

I know it sounds silly.

Someday you'll know
what I mean.

So, tell me
about your brother.

How did we
get to that?

I don't know.
I mean...

These are all
the things that
I don't know about you.

There isn't
much to tell.

Ok, I sang
at that truck stop,

And I showed you
my notebook.

Now it's time for you
to do something that
you don't want to do.

Well...

Doug is almost 20 years
younger than I am,

And he lives
in California.

Why don't you
talk to him?

It's a long story.

I wanted to teach him
a lesson years ago.

I think he got the lesson,
but he never forgave me.

Have you ever been
skinny-dipping?

No.

I keep thinking about
that pool

By that big country club
when we were driving in here.

Why don't we chalk up
another first while
we're on the road?

What do you say?

No.
Why not?

Because you're sick,
and, no offense,

But the idea
of skinny-dipping
with my grandma

Doesn't sound like
a whole lot of fun.

It actually sounds
kind of creepy.

Well, I'm going
skinny-dipping.

Are you sure
you want to do this?

You only live once.

I don't know if I can
make it over the fence.

How did you
get over there?

The gate's open.

That works.

Ella:
How's the temperature?

Annie: Who cares?

Oh, it's beautiful
in here!

You didn't
finish your story.

Tell me about
your brother.

Doug was living with us

After my folks passed.

He didn't deal with
their passing all that well.

He was good kid,
but for a while there,

He always seemed
to find trouble.

One night he got
caught shoplifting,

And they arrested him.

I thought he should spend
one night in jail

Before we got him out.

Like I said,
to teach him a lesson.

When we finally
got him out,

He was awfully
mad at me.

We got into
a huge fight,

Said things I'm sure
we both regretted
our whole lives.

Then he packed
his bags,

Moved to California,

And I never heard
from him again.

Ella: What happened
to him?

Like I said,
he was a good kid.

He learned his lesson
and just... Lived his life.

Why don't we stop
and see him?

Doug?

I wouldn't know
what to say.

[Police siren whooping]

Oh, poo!

Man: Yes, officer.

We are always having
trespassers.

This is not a public pool,
you understand.

I understand, sir.
I'll take care of it.

I thank you.
Mm-hmm.

Uh, well, um...

That gentleman there--
that's Mr. Langelos.

Annie: Does he live
at the country club?

Uh, heh. Ma'am...
This isn't a country club.

It's his private
residence.

Oh, my.

My partner here will
drive your car behind me,

Save you a $100
impound fee.

Thank you.
Sure.

Officer: Just, uh,
come this way.

Thank you.


Ok.


Turn the other way.

Annie: One day we'll
look back on this

As our
"night in jail".


Boy, Doug would
find this a real hoot.

His goodie-goodie
sister in the can.

Grandma,
this isn't funny!

God, don't you take
anything seriously?

Oh, we'll be
out of here in no time.

We don't have money
for the fine.

We're gonna have to
call dad.

I'm sure he'll be
joining us

Sooner rather
than later.

Uh, you sure there isn't
anyone you'd like to call?

Uh, in a moment, son.

Right now...
Would you mind

Pointing me to that
bathroom over there?

Uh... Well,
miss Eason, um--

Oh, call me Annie.

Annie. That's really just
for police personnel only.

Now, you wouldn't want
your mother using that,
would you?

Uh, no, ma'am.

Could you find it
in your heart to...

Treat me like
your mother?
Just this time?

Uh...

What the heck.

[Door opens]

This way.

Where's your partner?

Oh, he's out
on a call.

Would you be a dear...

And make sure
it's clean?

I have a thing
about bathrooms.

Sure.

Yep, looks ok
to me, Annie.

Annie?

Let's go.
Annie?

No!
Ella Mildred Eason...

It's now or never.

[Tires screech]

Cross another one
off life's to-do list.

We're a regular
Thelma and Louise.

We're gonna
go to jail.

We've already
been to jail.

No, I mean,
<i>real</i> jail,

Where there's gangs
and murderers.

Don't be silly.

We're gonna get
caught, grandma.

Relax, Ella bear.

Relax?

How am I supposed
to relax?

You guilted me into
going on this trip
with you.

You--you lied
and told me

You need some kind
of heart surgery.

And then you broke us
out of jail.

You don't need me on
this trip with you.

You just need
a chauffeur.

That's not true.
Oh, yeah?

Well, that's how
I see it.

You're going through
a very hard time,

And it's hard to see
the light at the end
of the tunnel.

But trust me.
Trust yourself.
It will be there.

And as far as needing
a chauffeur,

I don't need a chauffeur.
I need a best friend.

And she happens to be
sitting right here
next to me.

Oh, come here.

Now, tell me
that didn't feel good.

That didn't feel good.

Ok, it felt
kind of good.


Just make that
the last thing

We cross
off the list.

Deal.

[Police sirens blaring]

Ohh.

I drove just about
all night.

<i>Brenda: Sweetheart,</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

Some small town in Kansas,
near Colorado.

I'm gonna send you
this email right now.

<i>I hope it helps.</i>
Brenda, I know.

I know that the project
is in jeopardy.

You're just gonna have to
stall them as best you can,
all right?

Ok, I'm gonna
send this to you.
<i>Fine.</i>

Ok, bye.

<i>Ok, bye.</i>

Excuse me.

Um...

Where are we?

Arizona.

About 40 Miles
from Nevada.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

What?

What you just did--
it's called flirting.

No, it isn't.

"thank you."

Stop it.

You should be proud
of yourself.

You're a good flirt.

Oh. Only two left.

Ok, we need to
get you some more pills

And some good rest.

I'll have all the rest
I need before long.

You know what?
I'm gonna call my dad.

The least he can do
is wire us some money.

Ella...
I'm going to call him.

What are you
looking for?

My phone.

Maybe it's in the car.

I left it on that
policeman's desk.

Oh, boy.

[Musical cell phone ring]

Hello?
Who's this?

Uh, this is the police
in rand junction.
Who is this?

This is Richard Eason.
Is everything all right?

You wouldn't know
Annie and Ella Eason,
would you?

Yes, that's my mother
and my daughter.

Are they all ri--

what have they done?

Why don't I tell you
where I'm at,

And we can talk
in person?

You're not from here,
are you?

It's the clothes,
isn't it?

Your car's Illinois
license plates.

I saw you drive up.

How long are you
and your mom in town for?

Oh, that's
my grandmother.

We're just...
Passing through.

I'm sorry. I didn't
even introduce myself.

I'm Scott tardy.

Oh, uh...
[chimes ringing]

Ella Eason.

Very nice to
meet you, Ella.

You, too.

If, uh...
You're staying in town,

And if you and your
grandmother want
something different to do,

It's open-Mike night tonight.
It's pretty popular.

Ok, I'll ask her.

Ask me what?

I thought maybe we
could come back later

For some coffee.

Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

This is my grandmother
Annie.

I told Ella
it's open-Mike night,

And we get some
pretty good singers.

Ella has the voice
of an Angel.
Grandma.

You didn't tell me
you could sing.

Annie:
I'm not surprised.

Would you sing
for us tonight?

No--
she'd love to.

Great. I'll see you
tonight.

What did you
do that for?

You have to sing
sometime.


He is so cute. Heh.

And you thought you didn't
know how to flirt.

Come on.

Richard: Listen, I can't
apologize enough for this.

It's all right.

It turns out the charges
were dropped.

They were?
Yeah.

It seems that,
uh, Mr. Langelos

Was a little taken
with your mother.

Ah, she was
skinny-dipping,
you know.

I mean, of course
I was, uh--

I was fixing
to let them go
before the escape.

Now, if this were
to get out,

I would be the butt
of all the jokes
in town.

So, uh... I'd just
as soon keep this
between us.

Well, I'd
appreciate that, too.

Thanks very much.

Have a safe trip.
Ok.

She really was?
Skinny-dipping?

Buck naked.


Richard: Brenda, did you
get the email I sent?

<i>Brenda: Yes.</i>

And you passed
the schedule and figures

On to Backis, Weller
and Nucci?

<i>Yep.</i>
Ok, then.

I don't know what else
I can do for them.

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
If they call again,

Tell them I've sent
everything they need

To keep the project
going forward.

<i>Ok.</i>

Now I have
to track down

My delinquent
mother and daughter.

<i>Don't forget to eat.</i>

Talk to you later.

%% Now, it's just
so hard to feel %%

%% to open up again %%

%% when it all seems
so real... %%

Good evening, ladies.

You both look
lovely tonight.

Thank you.
Thank you.

I saved you a table,
just in case.

Scott: The coffee's on me.

Ella, you go on
in 20 minutes.

I can't wait
to hear you sing.

Annie: Me, either.

Me, either.

Somebody has
a crush on you.

Yeah, well, he won't
after I vomit all over
his stage.

You're gonna be great.

%% Just fade away %%

%% and begin again %%

[applause and cheers]

First of all, I'd like
to thank you all

For coming down here
tonight.

We have a treat for you.

Do you remember
what I told you

About how I talk
to grandpa?

Now, close your eyes.

Go sing this
for your mama.

Please welcome... Ella.

[Light applause]

<i>[microphone feeds back]</i>

I'm sorry.

This is for my mom...

<i>[applause and cheering]</i>

[hangs up]

All that time, and--

Well, you just
blew me away.

Oh, your mother
would be so proud.

That was tremendous.

Oh! My purse.
I'll be right back.

Thank you.

Can I ask
where you're going?

A very
important place

On the California
coast.

What's it called?

I don't know
the real name, but...

My grandpa named it
Annie's point

After my grandma.

Is your grandfather
gonna be there?

I guess you could
say that.

It was
an absolute pleasure

Meeting you,
Ella Eason.

You, too.

I'd wish you luck...

But, uh, I don't think
you're gonna need it.

With what?

Just promise you'll
send me a copy

Of your first CD.

Heh. I promise.

That was true beauty
in there.

Thank you.

Oh, no. Thank <i>you.</i>

I couldn't have
done it without you.

Oh.

I only wish
mom was here.

Well, who knows?
Maybe she was.

I <i>do</i> know
your father was.

What are you
talking about?

I finally figured out
how to use a cell phone.

He heard every note.

Ha!

Ella: We've been in Nevada
for about an hour.

There's not much to it.

Annie: There will be.

What do you mean?

You'll see.

Ella: Wow!
This is amazing!

It sure is.
It's changed quite a bit

Since your grandpa
and I were here.

We'll pull in here.

Are you sure?

Positive.

%% I'm so happy to be here %%

%% when I look around,
it's clear %%

%% yes, it's perfectly... %%

Ok, I'll call dad.

Not yet.
I feel lucky.

You want to gamble?

I'd rather do that than
give in to your father.

Gramm, we don't
have any money,

And I think
we're probably
wanted fugitives,

And you're almost
out of medication.

What do you
suggest we do?

No.

Grandpa's father
gave it to him

To bring him luck when
he needed it most.

But it's your
lucky coin.

Exactly.

No, that's crazy.

It's the least crazy
thing I can think of.

Here it is, down here.

Dealer: No more bets.

24.

We have to go again.

Lucky 19.

%% What have you
got to lose? %%

%% Take a little Chance,
you won't be sorry... %%

No more bets.

28.

%% Oh, what have you

%% I'm on fire %%

%% 'cause you lit my fuse %%

Ella: Ok,
this is it, grandma.

As they say...

Here goes nothing.

Dealer: No more bets.

%% Ohh, what have you

19!

Aah! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

Ohh, gosh! Aah!

Ohh! Ohh!

Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

Ok, I am gonna go
get the coin back

From the pawn shop.

I'm still feeling lucky.

Ok.

Woman: Oh, no!

Are you ok, ma'am?

Oh, fine.

Just a little
excited.

[Ball rolling]

Um, last name Gordon.

First name Douglas.

<i>Operator:</i>
<i>Hold for that number.</i>

<i>805-555-0083.</i>



[cell phone ringing]

Mom?

Hi, Richard.
<i>Are you all right?</i>

We're fine.
We may be in a bit
of trouble, though.

Don't worry about it.

I've already been
to that little police
station in Kansas.

<i>It's been taken care of.</i>

Thank you.

Where are you?
Where are <i>you?</i>

I'm getting closer.

How are you feeling?

Oh, I'm fine.

I just got some more
of my medication.

<i>You didn't sell</i>
<i>my house, did you?</i>

Nope. Not yet.

Why don't you tell me
where you are

So I can wire you
some money, just in case?

We don't need money.

We're not far
from Annie's point.

I assume you know
where that is.

Mom--
see you there.

Mom?

[Hangs up]


Ella: I know that
you have this trip
perfectly planned out,

But we're going
on a little detour.

Annie: The last time
that happened,

Your father took me to
that retirement village.

Where are we going?

There's someone that
I think you should see.

[Turns engine off]

That's a nice house.

It sure is.

It's your brother's house.

I can't.

I'm sure he'll be
happy to see you.

Did you ever think that
you might owe it to him?

[Doorbell rings]

Don't be nervous.

Oh, that's easy
for you to say.

May I help you?

Annie?

Hi, Dougie.

This is
my granddaughter.

I guess she'd be
your great-niece Ella.

Nice to meet you.

It's really nice
to meet you, too.

Ohh.

Uh...
Who's this, dad?

Well, this is
your aunt Annie,

And this is your
cousin Ella.

Annie, Ella...

This is
my daughter Lucy.

Thanks for dinner.

Oh, you're welcome.
It wasn't much.

Lucy's beautiful.

She gets that
from her mother.

I'm sorry she's
out of town.

She would've loved
to meet you.

I'm sorry, too.

Eliot?

He fought so hard...

For so long.

He went peacefully.

He was a good man.

Very good man.

Uh, our son Richard

Took over Eliot's
construction company.

Oh, good for him.

That's good.

Annie... Heh.

I picked up the phone

To call you
a thousand times.

But, as each year
went by,

It just got more
and more difficult

To know
what to say.

Don't blame yourself.
I have a phone, too.

I never should've tried
to teach you that lesson.

And for that I've never
forgiven myself.

I'd be lying
if I told you

The price wasn't high
in not seeing you

And Eliot and Richard.

But, you know,
it made me
who I am today.

I work with kids,

Trying to help them
find direction
in their lives,

And I never would've
been able to do that
without you, Annie.

I never doubted
you'd make a success
of yourself, Doug.

I miss you.

Miss you, too.


So, what happened
with the cop?

Nothing.
My dad met with him,

And he dropped
all the charges.

He was so embarrassed

That an older woman locked
him in his own cell.

He's not gonna tell
anybody anything.

So, how long have you
and aunt Annie been driving?

About three days.

Who would think
it'd be fun to drive
across country

With their grandma?

I gotta tell you,
when she and I first
got in the car...

I would've rather
been anywhere else.

I mean, I never thought
that my grandma

Could understand
anything

That was going on
in my world.

And?

She taught me more
in a few days

Than I ever would've
learned in school.

You're in college?

I was.

Well, what happened?

I left.

So, you just quit?

Well, my music never
would've had a Chance
if I didn't.

What do <i>you</i>
want to be?

A writer.

That's awesome.

It would be awesome
to actually have
a book published.

A wise woman
once told me

That the world is open
to all of our dreams.

And what if they're
just dreams?

Well, you won't know
until you try.

You gotta do
what makes you happy.


Here's some
water, Annie.

Oh.

Thank you.

Those are
some big pills.

What are those for?

I'm just getting old.

Are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine.

It's been
a long Journey.

Nothing a good
night's sleep

And comfortable bed
won't fix. Ha ha!

Oh, it's really good
to see you, Doug.

Same here.

Now, you're sure
you're all right?

Oh, I'm fine.

'Cause I'm right next door
if you need me.

Fine.

Good night, Annie.

You need
anything else?

Oh, we're fine,
thank you.

Well...

Bye, Annie.

So, let's not let
another 30 years
go by, ok?

Ok. I'll talk
to you soon.

Wait, Annie.

I just--
I wish so much

That I could've talked
to Eliot one last time.

I'm so sorry I didn't.

But mostly,
I'm sorry that...

I wasn't there for you.

So, even if we
haven't spoken,

You were always
there with me.

Thank you.

Hey.

Happy 50th anniversary.

Thank you.

Have a nice trip.

Come back, ok?
Thank you.

I'm proud of you, Doug.

Eliot would be, too.

[engine starts]


Grandma, I think
we need to get you out
of this car for a while.

No.

But you look really
uncomfortable.

Ella bear,
in less than two hours,

I'll have more energy
than I'll know what
to do with.

Trust me.

Hey.

Annie: It's more beautiful
than I remember.

It hasn't changed
one bit.

It's as though we were
here yesterday.

Oh, your grandfather
looked so handsome.

I'm ready to take
grandpa home now.

Richard: Brenda?
<i>Yes?</i>

You got the three
wise men on the phone?

<i>Uh-huh.</i>
Great.

Put 'em through.

<i>Ok.</i>

Gentlemen.
<i>Hello, Richard.</i>

Are we all together?

<i>Yes, we're all here.</i>
Good.

<i>Listen, we'd like to</i>
<i>talk to you about--</i>

Let me start out
by saying that,

While I can certainly
appreciate your desire

To see these projects
through to completion,

What I do not appreciate
is being talked to

And treated
like an amateur.

My father put all
three of you on the map,
and your companies,

Without ever
letting you down,
and I won't, either.

But right now
my family needs me,

And I refuse to
let <i>them</i> down.

So, I will contact you
when I get back to town,

And when that happens,

I will fulfill
all of my obligations,

As I expect you
to fulfill all of yours.

We understand each other?
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

Excellent.
Have a nice day.

Are you sure
this is it?

I'm sure. Heh!

Is it how
you remembered?

It's beautiful.

Well, now I can see what
the fuss was all about.

Hey.
Oh!

Hi, daddy.
Hi, honey.

Annie:
Thank you, Richard.

I'm sorry you thought
you had to chase me

Clear across country.

But coming here was
very important to me.

When I started
this Journey,

I honestly believed
I'd soon be joining
your father.

I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

I'm sorry I made life
so difficult.

You were just
looking for support.

No, I was being selfish.

You were the one doing
your best to help.

But now that I'm here,

I feel reborn.

And I owe a lot
of that to Ella.

Ohh.

She's just like
her mother.

Well, and she's also
just like her father.

You're a good dad,
Richard.

Your father would be
proud of you.

Wow.

Yeah. Dad told me
about this.

He wanted you
to have it.

Thanks.

I'll only be a minute.


Oh, Eliot, we made it!

And on time!

Wasn't able to finish
the picture, Eliot.

I was afraid
I forgot what
the place looks like.

But it's the same,
isn't it?


Oh, I miss you,
my dear.

You could always
make me laugh.

I heard you sing.

I know.

You were really,
really good.

I wish your mom
could've heard you.

I think she did.

I miss her so much.

I've never been able
to let her go.

But that's no excuse
for me to be as hard
on you as I've been.

You're just
being a dad.
Yeah.

And, as your dad,

I need to
tell you that...

You don't have to go
back to school.

I just need something
else right now.

But I promise I won't
leave you in the dark
anymore.

I'll let you know
what I'm feeling...

Whether you like it
or not.


Let's go see how
your grandma's doing.

Mom? You ok?

Mom?

Grandma!
Mom!

Are you ok?

Can't an old woman
take a nap without a fuss?

Ohh, for a minute
there, I, uh...

Thought maybe...

You thought what?
Well--

That I came
all this way to die?

Are you kidding me?

Did you take
your medication?

What do I tell you
every time you ask?
Sorry.

You can be
a bit of a pest.

But I know
you mean well.

Shall we?

Happy anniversary, my love.
