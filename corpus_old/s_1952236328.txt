Would you please state
your full name and date of birth.

Robert Oswalde.

13th of August...

1961.

It´s the police!

Excuse me, please!

We´re laying new drains.
I think it´s covered in polythene.

So, she consented to sex with you?

She was begging for it, man!

If she was willing,
why did you use violence?

You know how these things happen.

No, I don´t know.

Some of them white thing,
them like it rough, you know!

Jesus, Frank, what is it with you
and red lights?

Have the Pakis murdered someone?

Shut your mouth and move that bike.

Nobody talk to him like that!
We live here, not you!

Are you in charge?
Yes, sir, for the time being.

Then, please, take it away.

We will, sir, as soon as possible.

Not "as soon as possible" - now!
I pay my poll tax.

It´s a suspicious death, sir.
All this has to be done properly.

Can you go with this officer, please?

I´ve just got to ask a few questions.

How did you know
that this girl wanted it "rough"?

I knew. The way she look.

Well, how did she look?

She had blonde hair...

...and she was wearing a red blouse.

And a tight, tight, black skirt,
like for you.

So she didn´t actually
say anything to encourage you?

But then, you did ram
her tights down her throat.

It´s just her word against mine.

It´s the doctor´s reports and
forensic evidence and her word!

How many other women have you attacked?
How long before you kill someone?

Kernan! If that is my Simone
that´s in there...

Nola, I´ve just arrived. Give me a chance
to find out what´s happening.

We won´t be issuing any statements tonight.
Now, go home.

You should all just go home!

You never did try to find my daughter!

You people should go home!

If it´s my Simone,
you can´t stop us from going into her.

Cordon it off properly. If it is Simone Cameron,
we´ve got a real problem.

Are Forensics here yet?

Yeah, they´re waiting for you, guv.

Were these slabs in place
when you bought the house?

Of course, yes.
You haven´t done any work yourself?

I´m telling you, no.

Thank you.
Down here, sir!

Right. Let´s take a dekko.

Look ´pon her now.
Sit down please, Robert.

She love it. Cock teaser, innit?

What she say I did to that bitch
is just turning her on.

Sit down, please, Robert.

The thought of a woman being humiliated
doesn´t turn me on.

Someone being frightened half to death.

But that turns you on, doesn´t it?

It must do.
Why else force yourself on someone?

You´re a very attractive man.

How tall are you?

6´4".
Oh, really?

Well, I´m sure a lot of women do fall for you.
But not this one.

Some women say no when they mean yes.
Ah! So she said no to you?

I said "some women".
She said no?

I´ve nothing to say.
That´s not begging for it.

Bullshit! She put words in my mouth.
Now let me ask you this.

That´s a good place to stop.
I haven´t finished yet.

Unfortunately, we´ll have to,
since it´s well after six.

Unbelievable!

Excellent, though I would just add
one word of warning.

Some of DCI Tennison´s
more unconventional questions

might get a less-experienced officer
into difficulties.

Remember, under PACE, no attempt
may be made to bully or threaten a suspect.

Finally, well done DS Oswalde,
for playing his part so convincingly.

And finally, tomorrow´s first sessión
will be on interviewing the victims of rape.

See you all at ten o´clock.

You´re too good at that, Detective Sergeant.
T´ank you, ma´am.

Are you having a drink later on?
Maybe. Or I might have an early night.

Might see you, then.

Looks like it´s a female, Oscar.

Oh, yes? What makes you say that, Mr Gold?

It´s wearing a bra.

Oh, God. That´s all we need.

Tony, take over till Tennison gets here.

But she´s still on that course, guv.
Not any more, she´s not.

Oh, great.

Already?

Yeah. Now what was it you were saying
about white women liking it rough?

Hey, that wasn´t me. I don´t think like that!

Oh, I know, I´m sorry.

Hey...

Know what I´d like to do now?

What?

Drink the entire contents of the minibar.

Why?

Dunno, I just feel like it.

OK. What would you like first?

Champagne.

Right.

Oh, God... That´s Dame Sybil.

Don´t make a sound.

Hello?

Hello, guv.

About two hours. Why?

Right.

OK.

OK. See you. Bye.

What´s wrong?
That was my guv. He wants me back.

Now.
What?

Yeah, he wants me to head a murder inquiry.

I´ll have to tell Thorndike.
Damn, it´s my lecture tomorrow!

Look, sod Thorndike.
Sorry, but there´s nothing I can do about it.

I know that.

What´s your problem, then?

What about us?
What about us?

I see.

Bob, I´m not saying
I don´t want to see you again.

Aren´t you?

Come on, this is hard enough as it is.

I hear you. OK? The Detective Chief Inspector
has given her orders.

What did you expect?

That´s unfair.
It´s not as if the love of your life is walking out.

I don´t like being treated like some black stud.

Is that what you think´s been going on?
Yes, I do.

Well, that´s in your head.

Is it?

I think you´d better go.

Don´t worry. I´m going.

I hope I can rely on you to be discreet.

You really are something else, aren´t you?

Bitch.

I don´t know anything about rape victims.

Then it´s time you did.

Attitudes like that mean only 8% of rapes are
ever reported. There are my notes.

It´ll be a help but it´s bloody annoying.

What can I do, David?
Isn´t another DCI available?

Yes, but Kernan wants me.

Why?

Maybe he thinks I´m a good detective.

But why this specific investigation?

The body was found in Honeyford Road
where the Cameron family still live.

It could be Simone Cameron.

Politically sensitive, certainly.

A word of advice.

Charges may be brought against the officers
in the Derrick Cameron case,

if it goes to the Court of Appeal.

Quite right too, if that boy was fitted up.

What are you getting at?

I´d be careful, if I were you.

This may not turn out to be such a prize for you.

Obviously, you´re a liberated woman.
Oh, thank you, David!

But don´t be too trusting
of our Afro-Caribbean friend.

That´s your advice, is it?

Good luck tomorrow.

Oh, and drive carefully if you´ve been drinking.

OK, ma´am.

Nola!

Go on home!

Not if it´s my Simone.
I don´t want to lose her a second time.

Natural plant fibre such as cotton

disintegrates and forms part of the diet
of the early inhabitants of the corpse.

But wool, like hair - they may be the same -
can be remarkably resilient.

How old do you think she is, Oscar?

She was still growing.
Still in her teens, I´d say.

How long before a corpse gets like this?

That I can´t tell yet.
Oh, come on, Oscar! Minimum time?

Two years? Don´t quote me on that.

So it could be Simone.

You see, you´re doing it already.

When were these garden slabs laid?

Before the Viswandhas came here.
About 18 months ago.

Who did they buy the house from?

He named some property developer.

Have these slabs been disturbed since then?

Not according to the workmen, no.
So she was buried before they were laid.

Our prime suspect has to be
whoever lived here when she was buried.

We need a definite date of death.

Is there any of that soup left?

Oh, if there is, could you get some out
to Nola Cameron? She´s still out there.

The rest of you go home.
I´ll aim to have a briefing at 10am.

Right, guv.

Can you get a shot of that for me?

Hands tied together at the back with...

...a leather belt.

Just a minute, madam.

My daughter, Simone! Simone!

Simone!
It´s all right.

Simone!

It was all arranged weeks ago.
I´d go with the CLO.

I can´t back out now, but it´ll be a nightmare.

I want you to be there.
Community centre, starts at eight.

No thanks, I´m trying to give up.
Christ! Since when?

Six days, five hours, and... about 15 minutes.

The meeting is supposed to be
about community policing,

but given what´s happening,

we´ll be dragged through the shit
about the Cameron family.

Phelps is coming down tonight.
He´s bound to have the media in tow.

He can smell a vote-winner for 50 miles.
Let´s face it, guv.

Nola may be jumping to conclusions,

but we can´t claim
to have done well by her family.

Not if Derrick was fitted up.
Let´s concentrate on the immediate problem.

Is it the Cameron girl or not?
I don´t know.

I won´t get anything from Oscar Bream
till tomorrow.

Yep?

Yes, I´ll hold.

If we could find out before tonight´s meeting,
our lives would be a lot easier.

I´ll talk to Forensics. And I want that garden
dug up in case there are any more bodies.

Christ, what do you want -
another Nilsen? Sir!

That´s right.

I thought she was
the very best person for the job.

It requires tact and...

I´m sure she´ll be able to cope.

I will do.

Goodbye.

Now, how in hell does the Commander know
what happened on your course already?

What do you mean?

That I brought you back to lead this inquiry.

Well, I´ll give you one guess,
and it involves funny handshakes.

Thorndike? Same lodge?
I´d put my money on it.

Make sure you vindicate my decisión.

I´ll do my best, sir.

We need a name for this operation.
Where are we up to in the A to Z?

I think it´s "N", guv.

Look up the first "N" for us,
then, would you?

No way, I am not opening a book.

We could all earn a few quid.

Because last time I was £75 out of pocket!

You know why that was, don´t you?

You talked me into it!

Right, as some of you are aware,

workmen digging in the back garden
of 15 Honeyford Road

have uncovered skeletonised human remains.

The hands were tied behind the back

and the body wrapped in polythene,
so it´s definitely a suspicious death.

Some of you will be aware
there´s a lot of speculation going on in the area

that it could be Simone Cameron,
a local girl who went missing a few years ago.

Put that up for me, Jonesy.

Her mother Nola, who still lives near number 15,
is completely convinced that it´s Simone.

I´ll get the forensic boys and the pathologists
to answer that as soon as possible.

But in the meantime, we´ve got to take
Nola Cameron´s fears seriously.

Unfortunately, the Cameron family have been
the centre of attention for some time now.

The eldest boy, Derrick Cameron -
remember him?

He was accused
of stabbing a white youth to death.

He was sent to prison on the basis
of a confessión made here in this nick in 1985.

Now there are doubts cast
upon the safety of that conviction.

In fact, a campaign led by Jonathan Phelps,
Labour´s by-election candidate,

to bring Derrick´s case before the Court
of Appeal, is gaining a lot of support.

So there´s a lot of anger against the police.
There always is.

We always take the brunt.

We can rule out the present owners.

So our priority is to find all former residents
of number 15.

Let´s get down there straight away.
Passports at the ready!

That´s out of order! Have you been listening?

I don´t want the Camerons, not even
the uncles and aunts, interviewed at all.

As far as the other residents go, if we go in there
expecting aggro, start leaning on people,

well, we´ll get it. So it´s easy does it.

You´re graduates of the Rank Charm School.
Except Frank!

I want a list of all former residents
of the Honeyford Road area

for the last ten years.
Ten years?

DS Haskons is our office manager.

Does he get a hat?
Tony, have you got a name for us?

The first "N" is Nadine St, guv.

Nadine, very nice. So it´s Operation Nadine.

Nadine, is it you?

All right, come on, let´s go. Jonesy!

Go on, love. Run along. Quick!

I´ll get all this stuff bagged up
for you as soon as possible,

so you can get Mrs Cameron to look at it.

Pullover remains.

Bra.

Label from her jeans.

Pants.

Trainers.

And so on. Not very helpful.

I´ve got a pair of those. Not cheap.

Looks like a piece of skull.
Send it over to Bream.

Adidas.

But we have found several coins,
the most recent of which is 1986.

But most promisingly so far,
the belt that secured her hands behind her back.

Very distinctive buckle.
Could have belonged to her, I suppose.

Or the killer.

Morning. Local CID.

Good morning. DC Lillie, local CID.

We´re investigating
a suspicious death in this area.

Excuse me.

Jesus Christ, here we go.

Shut your mouth!

Now, calm down! Calm down! Relax!

You wouldn´t wear them for tennis.
They´d do your ankles in.

What have we got on the property developer?

Has since gone bankrupt and disappeared.

Jane, a word.

Yeah, in a minute, guv.

My office. Now!

Kernan the Barbarian!

Burkin has just arrested
a young black lad for possessión.

Oh, God!

He´s doing his bloody house-to-house,
smells a spliff and barges in!

Pulls the lad out by the scruff of the neck.

I don´t believe it.

So now we´ve got bricks
thrown into the garden at number 15,

a reception full of people bleating on about

infringement of civil liberties
and police harassment!

With this bloody meeting,
I just don´t believe it!

Shall I take Burkin off this inquiry?

We can´t do that, Jane.
I´m up for promotion.

Promotion?

Chief Super. Right now,
I can´t afford to do my dirty washing in public.

My interview would be a nightmare.

I hope you´ll be recommending me
for your post?

Oh, do you?
Don´t take too much for granted.

Now, get this boy cautioned and released
and tear bloody Burkin up for arse paper!

Guv, he was blatant, almost blowing the smoke
in my face, as if to say, "Nick me."

That´s not the point.
What with the Cameron case...

Cameron´s a villain, deserves to be banged up!
Frank!

So he had to be leaned on to confess.
So what?

So what?

So our reputation goes down the toilet!

What reputation? They hate us!

I ain´t so keen on them.
One less on the streets isn´t no loss.

You´re making a fool of yourself.

If they don´t want to be part of our country,
why don´t they go home?

That´s enough, Frank! Just shut it!

An outburst like that again,
it´ll be a disciplinary matter.

Yeah? Then perhaps you´d better
take me off the case.

You won´t be off the case, Frank.
You´ll be off the force.

If you think fitting someone up cos
they´re black is OK, you shouldn´t be Old Bill.

Yeah. I´ll be right there.

Jesus, this is a murder investigation!

A young girl finishes up buried
in someone´s back yard like the family cat,

her skull smashed to pieces.

What difference does her skin colour make?

I want that boy cautioned and
released, and then get back to work.

This way, Nola.

Look at these things, and tell me
if any of them belonged to Simone.

Yes, they are all her things.

Nola. Take your time.
Look at them carefully.

<i>Yes. These are her things.</i>

We found this belt buried with her.
Do you recognise that?

Yes. This is her belt.
She always wore this belt.

I see.

And what about this watch?

That is hers.

I bought her this watch!

Do you want to sit down,
would you like a cup of tea?

No, thank you.

The experts will give us more information soon.

Your dentist has supplied
Simone´s dental records.

We can compare those,
and then we´ll know absolutely for sure.

Until then, I´m afraid these things
are all we have got to go on.

Are you sure you recognise all of them?

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.
I see.

Thank you very much.

A report just in from Gold.

He reckons Nadine´s body
was infested with maggots. Bluebottles.

So?

Bluebottles won´t lay eggs underground.

So she was above ground
before she was buried?

At least a few hours.

And she must have been killed in the summer,
because that´s when the flies are active.

And Simone went missing in February.

So when I go into this meeting tonight,
I´m none the bloody wiser.

I want Derrick Cameron´s case
to reach the Court of Appeal,

so that someone who´s been wrongly
imprisoned for six years is released.

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act

brought in stricter safeguards
for the interrogating of suspects,

but that was not much help to Derrick Cameron.

If that means a no-go area...

If that means a no-go area, then...
With respect...

...I can´t make any such assurance.

We don´t want to create no-go areas.

We´ve heard
from your Community Liaison Officer,

who is, of course, a white police officer...

That´s a racist remark, isn´t it?

...about sensitive policing, community policing.

Yet once again, local people
are being treated as second-class citizens.

If you are talking
about our current investigation...

I am.
...then it is being carried out...

In a hostile...

...in a hostile and intimidatory manner,

with violent arrests being made by your officers,

though no charges were brought.

One of my officers
was provoked into making an action

which in retrospect can be seen as being hasty.

Look, the most important thing is,
there´s a murderer out there walking free.

We have to find that person.
To do that, we need the help of this community.

Afterwards, myself and three of my colleagues
will be staying behind,

in the hope you can give us
some crucial information.

For example, who was staying
at 15 Honeyford Road before the Viswandhas?

We know that!
He left when Simone went missing!

Please, Mrs Cameron...

Please!

What was his name? Somebody!

I would like to ask Mr Kernan
about the heavy police presence

in the Honeyford Road area at the moment.

I´d like to ask him how
he´s got the front to come here in the first place,

when Derrick Cameron´s banged up
for something he didn´t do!

Let him answer!

I cannot discuss the details of that case,

but I would have thought my presence here is
indication of good faith.

The justifiable anger and unhappiness

at what has happened to Derrick Cameron...

cannot be so easily dismissed by a police officer
stationed at Southampton Row.

I´m not dismissing...
This is the fundamental question!

Is it possible to expect justice in this country...

if you are a person of colour?

Allen. A-L-L-E-N.

Listen, I don´t like the police.

Thank you.

But I tell you this, you should talk to the guy
that Nola mentioned.

Yeah?
White guy about 50. Worked as a builder.

Can you give me his name, sir?

We argued about parking space.

And in the morning
all my car was covered in brake fluid.

But don´t worry, I got my own back.

Go on, then, tell me.

I pissed in his petrol tank!

Dave Hardy or Hartley. Something like that.

Word is a family called Allen lived at No.13.
They might have owned No.17 as well.

Esme Allen still runs a West Indian takeaway
which is nearby.

Great. Give it another half an hour here,
and then call it a day.

My son study for his school exam,
my daughter Sarah study law at university.

Them think the worid´s at them feet.
They´ll never scrub floor or take out rubbish!

Let´s hope
they don´t come down to earth with a bump!

Mrs Esme Allen?

Yes, dear?

I´m DCI Jane Tennison.

It´s not bad news? Has someone
been hurt? Sarah? Tony?

It´s OK.
We´re just making some inquiries.

My Lord! You gave me a fright!
Is it about that poor Cameron girl?

Yes, that´s right. In a way it is.

Is there somewhere more private?

Take the lady downstairs.
I´ll look after the shop.

All right. Come this way.

I understand that in the ´80s, you and your
husband used to own No.15 Honeyford Road.

Yes, that´s right.

But you lived at No.17 with your family.

Yes.

I´m sorry to tell you this, but a body has been
found buried in the back garden of No.15.

My God.

So we´re very anxious
to trace the former occupant.

You think he killed poor Simone?

We just want to eliminate him from our inquiries.
What was his name?

David Harvey.

And do you have any idea where he lives now?

No. My husband might know, but...

We tried not to have anything to do with him.

I wouldn´t let my daughter go near that house.

We all knew what he was like,
particularly with young giris.

He wasn´t always like that,
but after his wife died...

I thought they were a lovely couple,
but after she´d gone,

drinking and cursing and, you know, carrying on.

I´d better speak to your husband
and whole family as soon as possible.

Yes. We´ll all be there this evening.
Fine, thank you.

It´s Harvey. Not Hardy, not Harley. Harvey.
H- A-R-V-E-Y.

We´ve got to start again.
I´m going to see Oscar Bream.

It makes a pleasant change, not being
up to the armpits in someone´s viscera.

Though this girlie is sorely taxing
my memory of anatomy classes.

There are 206 named bones of the body.
26 to each foot for a kick-off.

Luckily, most of those
were still inside her plimsolls.

Fascinating, Oscar, but is it Simone Cameron?

Absolutely not.

What?

As I said,

like Simone, in her teens, 15 to 16, but taller.

Simone was 5´7". This girl is 5´8", 5´9".

It looks as if she was all there,
no mutilation. Good head of hair.

Luckily, Paul here likes jigsaws.

Bit of the zygomatic arch?

Are you sure that it´s not Simone?

Yeah.

Want me to point out the differences?

No, thank you.

Fractured her wrist when she was younger.

Playing netball? Fell off her bike?
That´s for you to discover.

Don´t rub it in.

Do you know if she´s black or white?

No.
Shit!

I´ve been going up a dead end.

We´ve got a man who can do jiggery-pokery
with the skull to ascertain ethnic origins.

Better still, a medical artist
who could make you a clay head at a price.

Is he good?

He´s our very own Auguste Rodin.

Yeah, but is he good?

Naturellement.

That´s expensive, right?

Do you want to put it to Kernan?

No, sod it. Let´s do it.
OK.

How long before I get it?

Three weeks?
Fine.

I´ll pick it up in three days.

I´ll talk to him.
Perhaps if you were prepared to model nude?

That´s sexual harassment.

What isn´t these days?

How did she die, Oscar?

No idea.

The skull could have been smashed after death.

For all I know, she could have been buried alive.

DA Harvey.

No, Harvey. That´s H-A-R-V-E-Y.

When can you confirm it?

Yeah, it´s just I´m trying...

I´m gonna do some myself.

Have you got anything for me?

Nothing so far, boss.

But we´ve got more stuff from No.15.
Jonesy´s getting it.

Let´s hope it´s good, then.

Right, listen up. I´ve just come
from Oscar Bream at the path lab.

It´s definitely not Simone Cameron.

So we operate on two fronts:
Find David Harvey and identify "Nadine".

It´s a bottle of Scotch
for whoever gets David Harvey.

Guv. They found a plastic bag buried, as well.

Gold has definitely linked it to the girl.
It contained this.

The cloth is West African. Several yards of it.

And those ivory bracelets are Nigerian.

Yoruba amulets, supposed to ward off
evil spirits. Didn´t work for "Nadine".

They´re very old and very valuable

May I talk to Esme, your mum?

Yes, please wait here.

Mum, someone´s at the door for you.

Hello, it´s Jane Tennison.

Yes, come in.

This way.

This is my son Tony.

Hello, Tony.

And his daughter Cleo. Say hello, Cleo.

Hello.

Tony and his girlfriend
are doing the decent thing at long last.

Their daughter is to be a bridesmaid.
Lord, how times have changed!

You wanted to see my husband?

Yes, please. Thank you.

So when´s the happy day, Tony?

Uh...

Do you like my dress?

Yes, I do.

I think that´s lovely.

Tony, just a minute.
Could you have a look at this for me, please?

That´s a description of the dead girl.

Do you remember seeing anyone like that
in this area in the mid ´80s?

She might have been at school with you.
I´m a bridesmaid.

You are, aren´t you?

Have you ever been a bridesmaid?

Yes, I have, but never the bride.

No.

Come along, baby. Say bye-bye.

Bye.
Bye-bye.

Wedding boy!

What can I do for you?

And you have no idea
where David Aloysius Harvey lives now?

I´m afraid not.

You bought this property in 1989, right?
Yes.

And Mr Harvey obviously moved in
shortly afterwards.

With his wife.

After she died, he let things go.

Then you sold the property in 1989
with Mr Harvey as a sitting tenant.

Did that lead to any bad feeling
between you and Mr Harvey?

Some.

Not much.

The problem we had was that
he was very erratic in paying the rent.

Sometimes he had money, sometimes not.

I presume you had a set of keys to No.15?

Yes.

Did you do anything to the garden
as the owner?

No. Harvey laid the slabs.

I didn´t want him to,
but he did very much as he pleased.

And when were those slabs laid?

I´d say... 1986, ´87?

Because it´s almost certain that body was buried
before the slabs went down.

Yes.

I can see that.

Mr Allen, how can you afford two properties
with your pay?

Esme´s cafe has always done well.

It was her money that paid the second
mortgage.

And your son´s at public school?

That´s right.

When will you ever learn, Pop?

Black people aren´t supposed to own
businesses, houses, get an education...

This is my daughter Sarah.

Now, there´s no need to be rude.

I agree.

Sarah, you´re the law student. And you´re 20.

So that means in the summer of, say,
1986, you would have been...

Um...

14. Mathematics not your strong point?

Not particularly, no.

It´s my son David who´s a wizard at maths.

Did you ever see anyone like this
in the vicinity of Honeyford Road?

Yes, of course. Simone Cameron.

No, it´s not Simone. We´re sure about that.
Please look at the description.

Well, then, if it´s not Simone,

you´ll need to be a bit more specific, won´t you?

That´s if you can be bothered.

And what does that mean?

Well, the police aren´t exactly
noted for their... enthusiasm

when it comes to solving cases
when the victim is black, are they?

Was she black? It doesn´t say so here.

Maybe it´s you who´s jumping to conclusions.

When´s the happy day, Tony?

Two weeks away now.

Well, I´ll see you before then.
Thanks for your help.

Bye-bye. Thank you.
Take care.

Got anything on David Harvey yet?

Not yet, guv.

We´ve tried the electoral roll,
NHS, DSS, rates...

I´ve just finished working my way
through the phone book.

You know, Vernon said
he was erratic on paying his rent.

Did you check the credit-reference agencies?

No.

Yes!

Well done, boss.

Mrs Eileen Reynolds.

Got a pen?

Fancy a drink?

I should go home, really.

Right, the twins. Off you go.

Night.
Night, Richard.

Got you! Got you.

They´ve done the tests on the skull.

"Nadine" was of mixed race,
West African and probably English.

That explains the Nigerian bracelets, then.

Let´s see what David Harvey´s got to say.

Jesus, I hope the lift´s working.

You know,
you ought to give up smoking cigarettes.

Makes you feel a whole lot better.
Ah, here we are.

There´s nothing worse
than a born-again nonsmoker.

David Harvey?

Yes.

We´re police officers.
Can we have a word with you, please?

So why did you move away, Mr Harvey?

Had my first heart attack.

After I left hospital, I came here
to be closer to Eileen, my sister.

I didn´t want to live there anyway,
not after my wife died.

I only stayed on
because a big darky wanted rid of me so badly.

I should never have moved to this dump.
I´m a bloody prisoner.

Lift´s always on the blink,
the place is full of junkies and pimps.

That´s her. That´s the wife.

She was the gardener.
Lovely garden when she was alive.

I tried to keep it going after...

Oh, well. You know.

In the end, I paved it over.

I can tell you exactly when, as well.

I hired some stonecutting equipment.

Ah.

There you go.

Last week in August.

It was during all that week that I did the digging.

Took up the grass, levelled it all off.

I´d laid about half the slabs by the Saturday,

stayed with Eileen Sunday morning,
stayed on till the Monday.

And Eileen lives locally?

Now, but in those days she lived in Margate.

Anyway, when I got home on the Monday...

I finished laying the rest of the slabs
and cemented them in.

So, the only time
the house was left unattended was...

That must have been on Sunday 31 st August.

That´s right.

Notice anything unusual when you got back?
Unusual?

No-one else had been digging in the garden?
No extra earth anywhere?

No.

I must say, if someone asked me what I was
doing on the last weekend in August 1986,

I don´t think I could remember.

How can you recollect so clearly?

Because my wife died on that day
the year before.

Oh, I see.

Eileen asked me down to stay with her
so I wouldn´t be on my own.

Oh, that´ll be my lunch.

I spend that weekend with her every year.

Couldn´t manage without her.
She always sends my food over.

Good. My colleague will want to speak to her.

It´s not her. This is my nephew, Jason.

What´s going on?

We´re police officers.

You´re certain you don´t recognise her?

What do you want with my uncle?
Quite sure. I´ll tell you later.

You know he´s not well?

I´m fine, don´t worry about it.

What´s all this about?

Your uncle will tell you after we´ve gone, Jason.

Thank you very much, Mr Harvey.
We´ll show ourselves out.

Lying bastard. He´d learnt his alibi by heart!
Yeah, right.

He didn´t shuffle six years ago. If he could lay
those slabs, he could smash a young girI´s skull.

We´d better get a move on, then,
before David Aloysius Harvey dies on us.

Where´s DCI Tennison?

Following up a lead, guv.

OK.

Can I have your attention, please?

This is Detective Sergeant Bob Oswalde.

Bob´s joined us from West End Lane
to assist on Operation Nadine.

Where´s the medical artist studio?

First on the left.

Hello.
Hi.

I´m DCI Tennison. I believe
you´re making a clay head for me?

Come in.

It may not look like much at the moment,
but... I have high hopes.

She had the most beautiful skull I´ve ever seen.

Really?

Oh, yes. See this?

The orbicularis oris.
The muscle overlays the maxilla and mandible,

on the eminences
due to the incisor and canine teeth.

Its fibres surround the oral aperture.

Function: Closing of the mouth
and pursing of lips.

I´m a scientist. Otherwise, I´d say it´s the muscle
that allows you to kiss someone.

When will she be ready?

By the end of the week.

Hang on, hang on, why me?
Bob needs a desk.

No, that´s not an answer. Why me?

Because you´re only ever at your desk
to drink coffee.

Cos I´m out making sure
the streets are safe to walk!

Superlillie!

What is happening? Bad enough policing them,
let alone working with them.

Just cos he´s taller than you.

No, he ain´t!

Can you shut up and get on with some work?

Tony, can I have a word, please?

Yes, guv?

What´s Bob Oswalde doing here?

Why? Do you know him?

Answer the question, Tony.

He´s part of the team. Kernan brought him in.

Thank you.

Jane.

I want a word with you, guv. Now.

Thank you, Sharon.

What do you mean by co-opting someone onto
my team without telling me?

It seemed to me that a black officer
would be a... How can I put it? A useful addition.

Why didn´t you consult with me?

Actually, I consulted
the Community Liaison Officer,

who thought it was an excellent idea.

A black face prominent in this inquiry,
an antidote to the Burkins of this worid.

Are you saying you can´t use an extra man?
No.

Then what are you saying?
He wasn´t in the original team.

Now if I ask him to do something,
it can be misinterpreted.

I don´t understand.

It smacks of tokenism, political manoeuvring.

You should have asked me.
Pulling rank undermines me.

I was just trying to help.
Oh, bollocks!

Sir.

You can´t work with the man?

Yes, I can work with him.

My sources say he´s a good officier.
Yes, I´m sure he is.

What have you got against him?

Nothing. Well, we didn´t hit it off particularly well
on the course.

I don´t want you to marry him!

I don´t want him on my team!

He´s on the team already. I´ve made my decisión
and I´m not going back on it.

Get the man briefed and put him to work!

We´ll review the situation at the end of the week.

I´ll be watching the progress of this case
very carefully from now on.

Do you expect me to believe
this is a coincidence?

No. How many black detectives
did he have to choose from?

It´s nothing to do with me.
I wouldn´t ask to be the token black.

Don´t think what happened on that course
gives you any special privileges.

I don´t.

Don´t you dare tell anyone.

Jane, what do you take me for?

Don´t call me Jane!

Give me some credit.

What happened, happened. It´s gone.
Long since forgotten about.

Let´s not give it another thought.

Yes.

Right. I´ll see you in back in the incident room.
I´ll be along in a minute.

We could have the clay head tomorrow.
End of the week, at the latest.

So, after talking to Harvey, let´s concentrate
on Sunday 31 st August, 1986.

Has Harvey got an alibi?

Yeah, his sister Eileen. I´ll see her shortly.

But what we need now is a name,

to build up "Nadine´s" life story.
Then we can connect her to Harvey.

A couple of statements talk about
a girl staying in the basement at No.15.

Really?
Conflicting reports, but it could have been ´86.

Brilliant.

Better start on missing persons.
Bob, handle that, please.

Tony, speak with Harvey´s consultant.
Check he´s not just a bloody good actor.

If he is, he should win an Oscar.

Yeah, right. That´s it for now.

Nice one. I´m glad to see the boss
is keeping our coloured friend in his place.

Guv. Can I put someone else on mispers?

Why?

Ma´am, it´s ridiculous, a man of his experience...

No. He might find something
a more junior man might miss.

Don´t call me "ma´am".

Of course I´m sure!

Every year since his Jeanie died.
He wouldn´t have left until the Monday morning.

He´s a sick man. You shouldn´t hound him.

Mum, they have got their job to do.
He´s waiting for an operation, you know.

You´ll be the bloody death of him.

We´re trying to eliminate him from our inquiries.

You wouldn´t hound him like this
if he was a black man!

I´ve questioned your brother once, that´s all,

which is not surprising, considering
a body was found in his garden.

Rubbish! "Simone Cameron" this,
"Simone Cameron" that!

Was it Simone?
No.

Exactly. It´s my brother you should
be concerned about. He´s the one that´s dying!

Is that all for now?
Yes. Thanks for coming.

Come on, Mum.

Don´t pull me about!

Well, he´s in the hospital tomorrow,
thanks to you!

Mum.

One last thing. You said you and Mr
Harvey fell out because he wouldn´t move.

Yes.

Is there nothing else?

What? No.

But didn´t he sublet the basement
to a girl?

That had nothing to do with me.

What had nothing to do with you?

Whatever she was doing.
And what was she doing?

I don´t know, it was none of my business!

It was if she was a prostitute, Vernon.

Why?

As the landlord, you could have been done
for running a brothel.

How dare you use the word "brotheI".

What word would you use?

I was at work all hours. Esme was too.

A neighbour told us men were calling there.

I spoke to Harvey straight away,
but I had no proof.

Then, suddenly the...

...girl...

seemed to have gone.

Did you see her?

Yes.

Was it the girl whose remains we´ve found?

Is that why you won´t co-operate?

Listen.

My family are very upset.

It is an important time for us.

A wedding should be a time of joy.

I have cooperated with you in every way so far.

Then please answer the question.

Did she answer to the description
I´ve given you?

No. She was a white girl.

Not just light-skinned?
No. White.

Can you describe her, please?

Small.

Perhaps 5´2".

A tiny thing, really.

Blonde hair - bleached, I´d say.

Young, but not the girl you described.

Did you have sexual relations with her?

I did not.

And what was the relationship
between Harvey and this girl?

God knows.

I wouldn´t put anything past that man.

And when did all this happen, Vernon?

It could have been the summer
you´ve been talking about.

The Viswandhas´ brief´s been bending my ear.

He tells me Forensic are still poking around,
lifting up carpets, floorboards...

So?

Let´s get them out of there as soon as possible.

Of course.

Let´s see it, then.

Very nice.

Right, I want these photos to appear
everywhere in local and national press.

Show them to anyone who might be able to
help. Let´s get the Allens in to see this.

Vernon Allen confirmed there was a tom
working from the basement of No.15.

His description doesn´t fit our "Nadine",
but maybe Nadine was a tom, as well.

Perhaps Harvey was a small-time pimp.

He´s in hospital all day tomorrow,
so I can´t tackle him till the evening.

She doesn´t look like a prostitute.

No.

Well.

Ask around, anyway.

Vernon Allen has confirmed the whereabouts
of his family on 31 st August.

You know there´s that reggae concert in
Honeyford Park on the last Sunday in August?

Some of you made enough overtime out of it!

Vernon Allen says Esme was there and is
every year. She runs a West Indian food stall.

Tony Allen was also at the concert.
It´s an all-day affair: 10am to 10pm.

Vernon stayed at home with Sarah and David.

Tony returned home at about 9pm
so that Vernon could go to work.

I´ve checked with Vernon´s work records
and he definitely did do a late shift that night,

right through Sunday night
and late into Monday.

<i>By the time Esme had packed up
and got home, it was about 10:45.</i>

She says by the time she got home,
all the three kids were asleep in bed.

Obviously, I´d like these accounts verified
wherever possible, OK?

Perhaps that´s the link between
"Nadine" and Honeyford Road.

Sorry, what is?
Reggae Sunsplash.

Yeah, go on.

Harvey could have met her there. Or Tony Allen.

Perhaps the victim´s bag of African cloth
was a costume.

She might even have been performing
at the concert.

That´s a good point.

Well, that´s an interesting thought.
Worth following up.

Frank, Gary, go first thing tomorrow morning
to the Sunsplash organisers.

See if they can point you towards any bands

using musicians or backing singers
wearing African gear.

Right. Any more bright thoughts?
Nope.

No? All right, well, that´s it, then.

Why are you doing this to me?

What?

Treating me like the office boy.

I don´t know what you´re talking about.

<i>Why didn´t you send me
to see the concert organisers?</i>

You´re busy already. Besides, you didn´t want
special tasks because of your skin colour.

I don´t. I want tasks commensurate
with my abilities and experience.

Well, I want you to continue overseeing mispers.

But I would also like you
to arrange for the Allens to see the clay head.

Watch their reactions.

Thank you.

No.

Are you sure, Vernon?

Absolutely.

Esme?

No, dear. I´d remember if I had.

What a beautiful child!

Tony? What´s wrong?

Come, Tony. Sit down.

Calm down.

Don´t fuss.

It´s all right.

It´s very hot in here. He suffers from asthma.

I see. Have you seen her before, Tony?

No. I´ve never seen her.

You´re certain?

I´m certain.

Our prime suspect´s dying.
I won´t sit back and watch.

I don´t know why you´re so bothered.
It´s just another dead prostitute.

You don´t mean that.

I do, if it means climbing these poxy stairs again!

She´s someone´s daughter.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Anything we get from the old sod
is likely to be thrown out of court anyway.

He didn´t know what he was saying...

No.

I´ve never seen her before.

I did let out the basement room that summer.
I admit it.

Nothing wrong with that.

The big darky complained
about everything I did. He just wanted me out.

So why did you let the room, David?
Did you know the girl already?

No, I´ve never seen her before. Look...

...it seemed a very big house just for me,
and I needed the money.

So I put a card in the newsagent´s.

What was her name?

Tracy? Sharon? I don´t remember.

How long did she stay?
Couple of months.

Which months?
June, July.

Not August?

No, she´d gone by then.

Did you know she was a prostitute?

No.

Could she have been friends with this girl?

It´s possible.

Do you think she had a set of flat keys?
It´s possible, I suppose.

Could she and some friends have used the flat
that Sunday you were at your sister´s?

How should I know?

As you say... I wasn´t there.

Your father remembers her.
Bleached blonde, slim, about 5´2".

Well, I don´t!

Do you like reggae, Tony?

What?

I do. Reggae, soul, jazz. Do you like jazz?

What are you on about? Just leave me alone.
Don´t jump the rails.

I don´t remember any girl!

There you go, mate.

One last thing, David.
Could we have a photograph of you, please?

Why?

It´ll help to eliminate you from our inquiries.

Will I get it back?
Yes, of course.

One from the mid-´80s, if that´s possible.

Are you the photographer?

No, my nephew Jason.

Mmm. Very good.

Here.

Younger and fitter there, eh?

Thank you. I´ll get it copied and have it sent
back to you as soon as possible.

I´d remove that, David. That´s not very safe.

So somebody can get in if I collapse.

All the same. Thank you.

Thanks a lot.

You´d make a wonderful
Crime Prevention Officer.

Night, guv. I hope you get something.

Thanks. See you tomorrow.

I wouldn´t if I were you, dear.

Hello.

Hi, Rachel. Fancy something to eat?

Well, if he´s a pimp, I´ve never seen him before.

I´ll ask around about the blonde,

but it´s not much to go on.
You´re telling me!

Maybe she was one of those that tried it for five
minutes and decided it was no kind of life.

One of the sensible ones.

Still, I suppose someone might remember,
cos most of the giris who do that area are black.

This is a likeness of the dead girl.

Spooky!

No.

Never seen her before either.

OK.

Do your best, OK?

I always do.

See you around. Thanks.

<i>Jane Remember
Friday´s Emma´s first birthday</i>

<i>Don´t forget to send a card</i>

Haven´t forgotten, Mum.

<i>If you´re back by 1030 you can telephone me
Daddy sends his love</i>

Thanks, Daddy.

<i>Mike Kernan at 935
I was hoping for an update</i>

<i>Any results from your clay head?</i>

<i>It´s my interview tomorrow and they´re boud
to ask me about Operation Nadine</i>

<i>Particularly whether my DCI´s
come in on budget</i>

<i>Ring me tonight if you can
or drop by my office first thing Bye</i>

The organisers have given us the names
of the bands using backing singers.

Let´s tread carefully there, Jane.
We´re under the microscope.

How´s Oswalde getting on?

Fine.

What?

There.

How do I look?

Like a Chief Superintendent.

Good.

I don´t know nothing about it.

Do you want to look at them, sir,
before you answer?

I don´t know her!
Right, mate? DC Rosper, Southampton Row.

Look at the photograph before you answer!

You can´t make a man look at a photograph.
Can´t I?

I can nick him for obstructing police inquiries.

He wasn´t even with the band then!

Can I have a word, Frank?

Let me take a look.

Guv?

Your battyman want a word with you, Frank.

Freedom...

What did he call me?

I don´t know.

You do. I´m gonna nick him.

That´ll be a big help!

Perhaps the guv gave you this lead

to see if you can talk to a black guy
without arresting him.

That drummer might know something.
I´m going back.

Go on, but you´re wasting your time.

Guv?

Thought you´d like to know,

Forensics found a fragment of our girI´s tooth
between the floorboards of No.15.

Yes!
I think I might have found her.

Joanne Fagunwa. Mixed parentage,
went missing in ´85 from Birmingham.

Got a photograph?
With the file, that´s in Birmingham.

Get it faxed. If it looks promising, then go.
To Birmingham?

Did we check on when Mrs Harvey died?

August ´85, wasn´t it?
Boss, can we go?

Yeah, come on, let´s go.

Nice one, Bob.

Later.
Yeah, man, later.

Where´s Dirty Harry?

Eh?

Your partner.
Clint Eastwood.

Oh, yeah, sorry about that, man.

Do you like reggae?
Yeah - solid, guy.

Seen!

Cheers.

Peruse these at your leisure.

Wicked!

Cheers!

Vids from ´86. Apparently
two bands used girl backing singers.

Do I have what it takes,
or do I have what it takes?

<i>I´m not saying you killed her, David, but what I
am saying is that she was killed in your house.</i>

Are you all right, sir?

Shit. Call an ambulance, Tony.

Don´t move. Don´t move.

Hello? Can I have an ambulance?
Quick!

Jonesy, we´re going to the hospital,
so you can contact us there. All right.

We could lose this one, if Harvey croaks.

Right, come on.

Can I show you these photographs?

Yes.

Do you recognise these amulets, Mrs Fagunwa?

Yes. They belonged to my husband´s family.

He gave them to Joanne.

Then I´m sorry to tell you that they were found
with the remains of a young girl.

Can I show you a photograph
of a clay head we´ve had made?

Yes.

Does that look like your daughter?

Oh, yes.

It´s very like her.

It´s very clever.

I´m sorry.

How did she die?

Well, we´re not certain,
but the circumstances are suspicious.

Don´t tell me she suffered.

Please, please, don´t tell me that.

Reggae

How´s it going, Gary?

I´m having a skanking good time, skip!

Are you, indeed?

<i>Are you feeling all right?</i>

Her father died that year, you see.

I still don´t know why she left home.

She had everything.

She even had her own pony.
She had everything.

Did Joanne ever have any accidents as a child?

No. Well, you know, the usual cuts and bruises...

Oh, yes, she did. She broke her wrist.
She fell off her bike.

Anyway, she rejected it all.

She started having bits woven in her hair.
You know, beads.

Her hair isn´t even black, really,
it´s more a dark brown with gold threads.

She was almost blonde when she was little.

And her skin looks almost tanned,
more than anything else.

She was such a pretty little girl.

We´ve got so many photographs.

I keep meaning to sort them out.

I don´t think the local police treated
her disappearance seriously.

Just another young girl leaving home,
going to London. Loads of them do, don´t they?

I saw a documentary. It isn´t just Joanne.

Reggae

Yes! Yes! Yes!

She always thought the best of people.

Perhaps we protected her too much.

I don´t know.

Have you got children?

No, no.

Would you like a cup of coffee?

That would be lovely.

Perhaps if ours hadn´t been a mixed marriage...

Do you think that could have been the problem?

Made her go off like that?

That´s right. And Bob Oswalde called in.
He´s got a positive ID.

Joanne Fagunwa. He´s bringing Mum in now.

Brilliant.

Turn it down, please!

He didn´t look that bad.

He´s a very ill man, you´ve seen yourself.

He has great difficulty breathing, even lying flat.
He needs complete rest.

Dr Lim, we have reason to believe he was
involved in the murder of a 17-year-old girl.

I don´t mind what conditions you make,
but we have to talk to the man.

This I recognise.

It´s my one and only attempt at knitting.

Why her?

Why her?

Thank you for your kindness.

Do you think you´ll find out how it happened?
You know, find the person who did it?

I´m sure we will.

I wonder...

This may seem...

Could I buy the clay head
when your inquiries are over?

It´s just that...

Does that seem strange?

No, no. I´ll find out for you.

There´s nothing else, is there?

There´s nothing to remind me of my baby.

OK. Take care.

Did the Allens have keys to Harvey´s house?

I suppose they must have.

Where did Tony Allen go to school?

Have you seen this, Bob?

Is that the tape of Joanne?

You should have a look. I think I´m in love.

I was his head of year.
I remember him very well.

Bright lad. Did very well in the fifth form.

Good results, going on to A level,
sights set on a college place.

But when he came back in September, he´d
changed. He was surly and introverted. A loner.

Let me know as soon as he wakes up.
I will.

I spoke to him, the headmistress spoke to him,
I got Dad up. Nothing seemed to help.

Ah, there we are. September ´86.

I´m usually right.
Educational psychologist´s report. Help yourself.

I see Tony played in a band.

Did he? I didn´t know that.

We did our best,
but there was really no point in him staying.

The only person he related to was his Sarah.
He´d gone by Christmas.

I still see him in the supermarket from time
to time. Waste, really. Bright lad.

Hello?

<i>Jane?</i>

Who´s this?

<i>It´s Bob Oswalde</i>

<i>Jane Look I know this is a bit uexpected</i>

<i>but I want to talk to you</i>

Can´t it wait?
I´m expecting a call from the hospital.

<i>No</i>

All right.

This had better be good.

I´ve seen this.

There.

Your finger, very interesting.

There´s a better shot in a moment.

There.

Is that Tony Allen?

Tony Allen.

Jesus!

He concealed the fact he played
at Sunsplash and evidently knew Joanne.

The Allens had keys to Harvey´s house.
I´ve been to his school.

Wait, wait, wait. Let´s think this through.

Just cos he´s on the same bandstand
as Joanne...

Oh, shit!

This could be it.
I´m expecting Harvey to come round.

What´s this?

Last night´s dinner.
One of those frozen chilli con carne things.

What have you got for tonight?

One of those frozen chilli con carne things.

DCI Tennison.

<i>Where do you think you´re going?</i>

Oh, right. Good. She got a number?
It´s a call box, is it?

Two, three. Got it.

Tell her I´ll call her straight away. Thanks.

It´s not the hospital. It´s a snout of mine
trying to get through to me.

Right.

What are you up to?

Rachel. It´s me. What you got for me, darling?

Bye.

What the hell do you think you´re doing?
What´s this?

It´s lettuce. Well, it was, once.

You really need to eat some decent food.
What was the telephone call?

Anything interesting?
No, not really.

The girl who was at No.15 jacked it in soon after,
went legit.

No-one knows where she is,
but they´re sure she´s not on the game.

I took a look at Tony Allen´s school records.

Now, everything was fine until 1986.

He came back from summer holiday
a different person.

The psychologist´s report talks of anxiety,
depressión, low self-esteem...

What is it with you?

What?
What are you trying to prove?

Do you have any tomato puree?

No.

How can I work in these conditions?
It´s as if you´re trying to take a test.

You´re no different.
I watched you on the course.

You know they´re lined up wanting to see you
fall flat on your face.

Thorndike and the rest of the senior shits.

So you want to be the best, come out on top.
Well, I´m the same as you.

Which is why,
when I calmed down and thought about it,

I understood
why you´d treated me like the office boy.

And why you´ve gone off on your own?
Bob, you are a member of a team.

Am I?

Well, from now on you are.

OK. I don´t suppose
you´ve got anything to drink?

So let´s pick him up!
No. Not yet.

I know that boy´s involved in the murder.

You have no evidence.

I saw him with the clay head.
They were just on the same bandstand.

So he lied.

We´ll tackle him when the right time comes.

What does that mean?
It means, not yet!

I can crack Harvey. I´m sure he holds the key.

Except the bastard might croak on us
at any time.

I thought you´d go for this.
I don´t want to argue about it!

Obviously, the point is,
I shouldn´t have come here.

Well, no, you shouldn´t.
We said that at the hotel.

That´s not the point. All I´m trying to say...

Look, don´t bother.

Oh, hello, guv.
It went very well, since you ask.

Sorry, what?

My interview.
Oh, yeah, right. Good.

Any news on Harvey?

He´s regained consciousness.
I´m going to see him.

Gently does it, Jane.

Get him anything he wants -
solicitors, geisha giris, anything -

so his brief can´t suggest
you got his statement unfairly.

<i>Guv, apparently Harvey´s wife died
in October ´85, not August.</i>

So his sister´s been telling fibs.
So it would seem.

Let´s see what Harvey´s got to say about that.

By-election today.
Why are you not in your blue rosette?

Senior policemen are politicians
first and foremost, Jane.

Remember that, if you´re up for super.

Are we in?
Dr Lim is a bit jumpy, but, yeah, I think so.

Good.

I don´t want him upset. Any extra
pressure on his heart could be fatal.

Hello, Tony.

You don´t remember me?
Detective Sergeant Oswalde.

I´m doing a bit of shopping, and while I´m here,
perhaps you could look at this.

Do you recognise her? It´s Joanne.

Why don´t you people just leave me alone?

Because you´re telling us lies.
You knew Joanne.

No!

You were at Sunsplash together.

Better than that, you played in the same band.

Remember her African costume, Tony?
Her bracelets?

I don´t know what you´re talking about.

Oh, yes, you do.

I don´t.

Don´t you think it´d be a good idea
to talk to me, David?

Get it off your chest?

Why?

David, we know that Joanne -
that was her name -

we know that Joanne
was killed inside your home.

A fragment of her tooth was found in the house.

Doesn´t mean I killed her.

Your wife didn´t die in August, did she, David?

<i>Jeanie died in October 1985.</i>

What´s the point in lying, David?
Carrying all that guilt?

You know you´re a very ill man.

If you do tell me, nothing will happen to you.

It´ll never come to trial.

We´ll just be able to clear this whole thing up.

And most important of all,
you´ll feel so much better.

Yo, Tony!

All right?

What is wrong with you?
Why are you doing this to me?

Doing what, man? I´ve been shopping.

Leave me alone!

Just leave me alone!

You know, I´m a Catholic too, David.

It´s been a long time since my last confessión.

But the one thing I do remember
is that feeling of relief, you know?

A great weight being lifted off your shoulders.

I think we all want to believe in something,
don´t we?

We´d like to think we could just repent,
everything would be all right.

If only we could just turn the clock back
and make everything all right.

You´re dying, David.

Why don´t you just get it off your chest?
Just tell me what happened.

No more lies. It´s too late for lies.

Come on, you can talk to me.

Can I?

Of course. You can have your doctor
present, a solicitor, Jason,

your sister, anyone.

You know, I´m only 55 years old.

It´s a joke.

I´m sure the doctors will do all they can.

I´m very frightened.

Leave me alone!

Leave me alone!
