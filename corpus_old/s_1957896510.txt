[upbeat music playing]

<i>â™ª Gonna roll up my sleeves â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Gonna get up and go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Gonna make
something happen now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Gonna make it happen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Raise it up now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Build it higher... â™ª</i>

I'm here. Sorry, Mr. Taylor.

You were up 20 minutes ago.

Why are you still here?
Just get out there.

Okay.
Hold on, hold on. Come back.

This is a pub.
Pubs love holidays.

Uh, no. December just started.

Christmas starts the day after
Thanksgiving. Just blame the Internet.

So, it's either these lights...

or Janice's
sweater. You choose.

[objects clattering]

Fine.


Lila.
Stop.

They're so colorful.

They're cute. Stop. Here.

There you go.

You ready to do the thing?

I was born ready.
Okay, let's go.

Thank you, Lila.
Got you, Mr. Taylor.

-Hurry up. Before he comes.
-[Gail] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

Yeah. Excuse me.

<i>â™ª Do the top â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Raise it up now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Build it higher â™ª</i>

Phone. Phone. Phone.

[Gail grunts]

<i>â™ª Do the top â™ª</i>

Hey, everyone.
Name's Gail Travers.

I'm 25, um...

I'm from, well, everywhere,

and this is "For the
Crowd" by Everly.

And thank you so much
for this opportunity.

[exhales sharply]

[strumming guitar]

<i>â™ª Go fast, slow down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What planet am I on now? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know â™ª</i>

Requests only.

All right. Okay. All right.

Um, anyone have any
requests for me? Requests?

Anyone?
[man] Hey.

How about, uh, Pat Benatar?

Oh! You got good taste.

I think I got something for you.

<i>â™ª We're running with the
Shadows of the night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So baby, take my hand,
It'll be all right â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Surrender all your
dreams To me tonight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They'll come
true In the end â™ª</i>

[strumming guitar]

<i>â™ª You said "Oh, girl,
it's a cold world" â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you keep it
all To yourself â™ª</i>

worth a try, right?

Uh... five artists
picked to be opening acts

on iHeart Radio's
Christmas Eve Special...

plus a spot on a tour and
a three-year contract?

Yes. It's worth it.

And it would've looked
profesh on that stage,

but it will be just
as good from anywhere.

Because it's you.

You're the best.

I hope you're right.

I'm always right.

Will you please take these
off me? Take 'em off.

Okay.

Okay.

Yes. They look
way better on you.

'Tis the season.


Oh, here. Don't forget this.
Oh, God.

Thank you. All right, I'll see you later.
Bye.

[pleasant music playing]


You're good.


[sighs]
Okay. We're rolling.

<i>My name is Gail Travers.
I'm from Miami, Florida.</i>

<i>Or at least that's
what they tell me.</i>

<i>And this is "For the Crowd"</i>

<i>by one of my favorite
indie artists Everly.</i>

[exhales heavily]

<i>â™ª Go fast, slow down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What planet am I on
now? I don't know â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I show the world
only Pieces of me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Stay home, go out â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I knew back then what
I know now would I go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And when it's over,
I'm getting closer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Every time I'm
'bout To break â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Then I make the
same Mistakes again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's only when I'm here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That I just wanna sing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Like there's No
one else around â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Leave all of my heart â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Exposed and open
For the crowd â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, oh-oh-oh, â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Mm-hmm â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I just wanna sing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Like there's No
one else around â™ª</i>


Got it. [chuckles]

Yeah.
Thanks.

You are the real
deal, Gail Travers.

You should write your own stuff.

Hmm.
I bet it'd be wicked good.

I don't know.

I don't think I can
write songs like that.

I've tried. I've tried...

but they just never
felt inspired.

Inspiration finds you, you know?

You just have to let it happen.

Wait, what are you doing?

I'm editing it.
You're taking out your ritual?

It's you.

Show them you.

Done.

[both chuckle]
[Lila sighs]

They're gonna love you.

Lila, it's iHeart Radio.

Five spots out of, what,
hundreds of thousands?

Come on.
Hey. If it doesn't happen...

someone somewhere will give
you the chance you deserve.

And plus, right
place, right time...

it's bound to happen with you running all
over the place in this tin can of yours.

Hey! Cool it with the tin can.

Jewel is a sensitive princess.

Be nice.

[both chuckle]

Or what if you stay in
Tampa for a little while

and take a break from van life?

I could, but, you know...

it calls my name.

[laughs]
You're crazy.

I gotta go.

Wait. What about your lights?

Just put 'em in the back.
Okay.

Love you.
Bye.

[breathes deeply]

[Gail voiceover] <i>One-year

[upbeat music playing]

[laughing and shrieking
in excitement]

Okay! Oh, my God!


[breathing unsteadily]
Okay, okay, okay.

it! I got a spot!

No. No! [shrieking] Oh,
my God. You made it!

I know!


Thanks. Thanks.

God. Oh, my God.

[Lila over phone]<i> Okay, uh...</i>

You better text me every single
stop you make on the way, okay?

You can say it.

I told you so!

I'll talk to you later.

<i>Bye.</i>


Whoo!

That's right. I'm
back on the road.

It's just me...

my guitar and America.

I'll be hitting
up open mic nights

from Florida all the way to LA.

"Why?" you may ask.

Well, it's just one
long rehearsal for...

drumroll...

opening iHeart Radio's
Christmas Eve Special...

with some of the top artists
in the country. [chuckles]

Let's be real for a sec.

I was homeless before I
bought my bus, Jewel, here.

I had no idea where my voice
was going to take me...

and now I'm making by
debut on national TV...

thanks to you guys.

I gotta earn some
gas money, friends...

so, help your girl out.

<i>First stop, tonight,
at Catch and Go Brews</i>

<i>in Mobile, Alabama.</i>

<i>â™ª It ain't easy To

<i>â™ª What you can prove â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, no, but it felt harder â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Holding back

<i>Thanks for a great turnout.</i>

<i>What a hello from the wonderful

<i>â™ª Oh, if I can go the mile â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why can't I go

<i>Just booked one night at Little

<i>â™ª Why can't it be me â™ª</i>


So many new friends joining
us today. [chuckles]

Must find coffee.
My machine's busted.

#vanlife.

I'm still in Oklahoma...

if anyone has any food stop recs

along the way to Santa Fe.

Trying to line up the next gig.

Check in later for deets.



[guitar music playing]

<i>â™ª Hey, good morning,
Good looking â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The sun is hot And
my brain is cooking â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, it's a long, hot
day, But I have to say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's been real nice â™ª</i>

[cell phone ringing]

Good morning. Who's this?

[over phone] <i>It's
Walker with iHeart.</i>

Ah, it's nice to
meet you, Walker.

I'm... I'm so excited
for this opportunity.

<i>- Are you preparing a song?</i>
<i>- Yes,</i> yes. Song, um...

I love oldies...

anything soulful, I
can spin acoustics.

<i>Well, we'll need you
to perform an original.</i>

An original?

You want a new song?

An original new song?

I haven't written anything. I mean,
that's kind of a fast turnaround.

<i>- If you'd like to pull out...</i>
No, no, no.

I would not like to pull
out. No. Uh, I'll have one.

<i>- Excellent.</i>
Yes.

An original song.
In two weeks.

<i>- Think festive.</i>
Copy that. You got it.

I'll be there.
<i>- Great. See you in two weeks.</i>

Bye.

[inhales deeply] Okay,
okay, okay. Relax.

[exhales heavily]

[screaming]
[hums]


[breathes heavily]
Oh, my. Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

No. Oh, my God.
Oh, my, no, no, no.

God. Oh, my God.

Hey, hey, hey. Are you
okay? Are you okay?

-Are you hurt? Are you hurt now?
-I'm fine.

[breathing heavily] I
just killed a llama.


Did I kill him? It? Her?

Okay, calm down.
They? Do llamas have pronouns?

Calm down. Here, take
some food. Take some food.

No, no, no. I couldn't
possibly eat right now.

It's for Eddie.

This little guy, he perks
right up for a snack.

[pants]
Don't we all?

All right, here,
I'll go check on him.

Oh, my God. Are you going to drag
him off the road by its neck?

alive. And he's up.

Come on, Eddie.
[Gail] Hi, Eddie.

You silly little rascal.

I didn't get your name.

[breathing heavily] Gail.

Well, Gail, meet Eddie.

Well, you see, you
completely missed him

but this little guy just
loved playin' dead. Don't you?

Especially, when it's
time to saddle him up...

for the Christmas card
photos with the town folk.

Give him a hat and
he's good to go.

This gal here, though...

she is not good to go.

Where are you headed?

Santa Fe and then LA.

I don't think I can
get you that far,

but why don't I tow you
into my shop in town.

You're a lifesaver.

Oh, it's the least I could
do. Now, do me a favor

and you be nice to Gail now,
Eddie, okay? No spitting.

Uh, I didn't catch your name.
Oh. It's Savannah.

But people around here,
they just call me Van.

Oh.

A woman named "Van"
is gonna fix my van.

Where the hell am I?

Welcome to Harmony
Springs, Oklahoma.

[tools clattering]

I can hitch a ride

to the nearest Verizon store?

No Verizon on the
horizon here, darlin'.

Your best bet's gonna
be a gas station

that sells walkie-talkies

and that would be about
50 miles that way.

Can I borrow your phone?

Absolutely.

Here you go.

Buttons all work, just
call who you like.

I was gonna update my story.

Your what?
My story.

We all got a story, darlin'.

Hey, you play the guitar?
Yeah.

No.

No, no, no.

No. It's broken.

[groans]
[Van] Oh, I am so sorry.

What am I gonna do? This
is bad. This is so bad.

Oh!
It ain't that bad,

but it ain't good either.


Best mechanic in Oklahoma,

also happens to be my son.

[clears throat] Now,

I like her so I want you
to be optimistic, okay?

How is she lookin'?

If we cut deals for
everyone you like, Mom,

we'd run out of business.

I mean, I can fix it...

but a vintage ride like this,

it's gonna take a
minute to get the parts.

How long of a minute?

Um, two weeks.

Two weeks? No. No.
That's what I said.

And that's if they
get here on time.

Well, I mean, that puts
us just before Christmas,

so I can think of no better gift

than to have this
beauty running like new.

I have to report
to LA by the 24th.

LA?
Yeah.

On Christmas Eve? What's
so important in LA?

IHeart Radio.


If you whip him again, will
he get more optimistic?

He's gonna try his
hardest. Aren't you, Jer?

How much is this gonna cost?

Well, with the bumper, the axle,

obviously the body work,
you're looking at about...

2,600 bucks, give or take.

26...
Yeah.


[objects clattering]
I got... Ooh, sorry.

[Jeremy] My tools.
[Gail] Um...

I got $540.

So, is that your
checking or your savings?

It's my everything.

Credit card?

Yeah, as long as you have
a pair of scissors handy...

for when the bank
tells you to cut it up.

It's a start to cover the parts.

Didn't you hear me?
This is all I have.

Okay. Well, hey, do you sing
with that guitar of yours?

Yeah, I used to.


All right, we just added
a show to your schedule.

And if you're lucky...

it may just add a little bit
of cash to that bevy there.

I have a lot of work I gotta do.

Well, the shop is
closing early today.

Don't be rude.

Go wash up, all right?

And show our new guest
here some hospitality.

[keys jingling]

right, you comin'?

Do you have a phone
I could borrow?

Has anyone in this town
ever heard of a smartphone?

There ain't no use
for fancy around here.

Clearly.

So, tonight's Pass
the Hat night,

which means best
performance gets the pot.

The pot's gonna be 2,000 bucks?

Yeah, no. Far from it.

But it'll be a start.

[woman singing in Spanish]

Wow. This is some
serious karaoke.

Yeah. Uh, two mixed.

I'll have a shot.

A shot?

Two shots.


<i>â™ª I wanna wish you
A Merry Christmas â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wanna wish you A
Merry Christmas... â™ª</i>

Well, well. Who
do we have here?

Famous Gail Travers.
[Gail chuckles]

Famous, huh?

No, not famous.

Well, I'm Scarlet.

Is it too late to sign up?

I'm sure they could
squeeze you in...

but you gotta give a
little to win a little.

Oh, here. Let me.

Let's see if Little Miss
Famous stands a chance.

All right, give it up for
everyone's favorite, Rachael!

[bell clatters]

Always a killer.

Thank you.

[bell clatters]

Oh, what's this?

We have one more performer.
Her name is Gladys Travelers

Looks like we have a
last-minute performer slidin' in

just in the nick of time.

One Gladys Travelers,
come on down!

That's my cue.

[bell clatters]

[crowd clapping]


[acoustif feedback]
It's actually Gail Travers.

Gail.
All right, Gail.

What song is it gonna be?

Um...

Anyone wanna throw in a
little extra for a shuffle?

Did... Did she say "shuffle"?

Shuffle? Yeah?

Looks like we got a shuffle.

All right, get your
last-minute money in

and let's spin the dial!

Ooh, this is an
oldie but goodie.

"Wayfaring Stranger."

know that one really well.

If it's good enough
for Johnny Cash,

it's good enough for me.

Amen.

You mind if I play it myself?

Knock yourself out.

[bell clatters]

Get those votes in,

so we can see who's
gonna take home the cash!

Where did that come from?

I just got lucky with the song.

Where did you say
she came from again?

Um, ah, she, uh...

Her car broke down just outside of town.
Oh.

She missed, uh... She
missed Eddie by an inch.

creature has nine lives.

How lucky are we?

Where you headed?
Home for Christmas?

Not quite.

The votes are in,

and the winner is...

newcomer, Gail Travels!
[all cheering]

Go, darlin'! Whoo!


It's Travers. Thank you.

[MC] Congratulations!
Thanks.

Ah, here you go.

Gotta be honest with you, I
never thought I'd see that back.

You know, actually, take the whole
thing. Put it towards the repairs.

Look at you, winning.

You know what? I'm...

I'm actually gonna get going.
It's been a really long day.

Bye.

She's a little
stuck-up, isn't she?

Where are you going?

She's got nowhere to go.

So?


Where ya headed?

Home.

What, to that old bus?

Yes, that old bus.

shop doors are locked, right?

Oh.

If only I knew
someone with the keys.

Come on. I'll drive you.

Your girlfriend gonna
come after me for this?

Nah, I ain't got a girlfriend.

Come on. It's freezing.

[pleasant music playing]


Original song, huh?

About what?

just A girl in a bus â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A broken-down bus
In the middle of â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª In the middle of nowhere â™ª</i>


No.

[inhales deeply, shudders]


[birds chirping]


No, no, no.
[machine whirring]


[Van grunts]


You let her sleep in the bus?

Well, you know, she was pretty
insistent about it, Mom.

[Van clears throat]


Thanks.



This has a license plate,

not a street address, okay?

No more sleeping in a vehicle
that is under maintenance.

Insurance won't cover it.

Sorry about that.
Here. Take this.

And you just, I don't know,
add it to your collection.

Thanks.

Sheriff?

Yeah. Sheriff Jeffrey's out of
town for the next two weeks...

a little hunting trip,

so a man's gotta
wear a lot of hats.

Hmm. Oh, you mean jackets?


Look, I got a plan.
Well, here's my plan.

Uh, you know what, you go first.

Tell me your plan.
I get a job while you fix the bus.

When you're done, I'll have
two grand and be on my way.

So, what do you got in
a town like this? Diner?

Post office?

Phone operators?

You know that minimum wage
around here is $7.25 an hour?

That's gonna be probably around
300 hours over the next two weeks.

Okay. [smacks lips] So,
what's your awesome plan then?


A middle school?

What, am I dealing pot?

What kind of middle
school did you go to?

It smells like sneakers
and fruit snacks.

You better start talking. Oh!

where have you been?

The twins, they're recruiting

for their new rap
song music video.

Sarah, slow down.

And since when are there
oboe players in a rap song?

-[frantically] And then... And then they were...
-Hey.

-Why were they... No, but they were...
-Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.

Look at me. Look at me.
My eyes. My eyes, okay?

[breathing heavily]
Okay? Good.

Do as I do. Follow me.

[both inhales deeply]

[both exhales deeply]

Better?

Oh!

Are you the new music teacher?

No.
Yeah.

What?

[unsynchronized music playing]

[blows whistle]

[music stops]

I'd like you to meet our
new music teacher, Miss...

you are all mistaken.

Pleased to meet you.
I'm Principal Crosby.

Heard of your performance
last night at Gus's Bar.

Seems you're
qualified for the job.

Jeremy here will be more
than willing to step down.

Am I right?

You didn't think I came up with
this out of thin air, did you?

I've been trying to teach these
kids for the last two weeks.

I can't imagine
how that's going.

What happened to
the last teacher?

Teachers. Everyone
in town's tried.

Jeremy was our last resort.

Look, the performance for the
Christmas Gala is in two weeks.

And this is a jacket that
I'd happily hand over.

Does it look like I know the first
thing about Christmas? Or galas?

Jeremy has informed
me of your situation.

You prep these kids

and I'll cover the bus repairs.

And if the kids win,

perhaps you will
leave Harmony Springs

with three percent
of the cash prize.

You can win a gala?

Each school selects
teams to compete.

There's cash prizes, prestige.

Do we have a deal?

All expenses paid,

that engine purrs like a kitten,

and I make it to LA on time.

Yes, yes, and yes.

Well, let's meet these kids.

Thank you.

Write your name on
the chalk board.

I'm going to give
you apples every day.

If teachers were
apples, I'd pick you.


After the gala, we have to
shut the music program down.

What the hell are you
talking about, Stanley?

I'm sorry, son.

We just simply can't
keep the program going.

So, uh, you're just gonna do this
without talkin' to my family first?

Or me?

I'm sorry.

Chalk board.

My name is Ms. Travers,

and I'm gonna be
helping you get ready

for the Christmas Eve
Gala in two weeks.

So, let's see what
we're workin' with here.

Let's go around the room

and tell me your name...

Name, musical interest, and
favorite Christmas tradition.

I'll start. I'm Sarah Hughes.

I wanna be an opera singer.

I like leaving food out for
Santa's reindeer on Christmas Eve.

Sarah. Opera. Reindeer. Noted.

You and you.

We're Jeff and
Johnny. I'm Jeff.

I'm Johnny.

We rap. Hoping to one day rock
Harmony Springs with our flow.

[beat boxes]


<i>â™ª Reindeer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can of beer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Santa â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Montana â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Mistletoe â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A puppet show â™ª</i>

Nice.

And we set traps in our chimney
to see if we can catch a Santa.

Oh.
We've never caught one.

Oh, no.
Dear God.

There's only one Santa

and Santa doesn't actually
rhyme with Montana.

Just to let you know.

Benjamin still wets the bed.

Hey. Okay, okay, no making
fun of one another, okay?

That's rule number one.

We have to support each other.

Your turn.

I'm Benjamin Donovan.

I like to wear matching
pj's with my mom and dad...

while we decorate the Christmas
tree, and I can play the oboe.

Sort of.

Do you all have to play
instruments for this thing?

We don't have to.

Okay, good. 'Cause I'm
not a real music teacher.

Mm, we're not really
music students.

So, what are your
musical skills then?

And your favorite
Christmas tradition.

Well, uh, I don't have
any Christmas traditions.

Why not?

I guess I never stuck around long
enough in one place to make one.


Long story.

How about I show you
my musical skills?

[plays piano]

saints Go marchin' in â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, when the saints
Go marchin' in â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, how I want to be
There in that number â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When the saints go marchin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª In â™ª</i>

[music stops]

Wow.

If we sing like that, we'll win.

[chuckles]
[schoolbell rings]

[Sarah] See ya.
[Gail] See ya.

Bye.
[laughs] Bye.


[boy 1] I know, right?
[boy 2] She's great!

[blows raspberry]

[door closes]


[plays piano]


Were you hiding back
there the whole time?

Sorry. I'm scared of
strangers and loud noises.

But you have a great voice.

Thank you. What's your name?

Rosemary.

Nice to meet you, Rosemary.

I sing to my animals.

That's my skill,

but my mom thinks I need
to be around more humans.

Yeah, humans.

Well, I'm very excited
to hear you sing.

[Rosemary exhales]

Did you sing in all the places?

What?

All the places you
never stuck around

long enough to make traditions.

I did.

Maybe that's your
Christmas tradition.

Singing.

Everyone has one, even
if they don't know it.

[Van sighs] One day.

Hey, Mom. Dad.

Hey, buddy. I saw you got
the beams up. Looks great.

[chuckles]
[Van] Oh, it's wonderful, Abe.

Yeah, you can really see the
rooms starting to take shape.

So, you know they're shutting
down the music program?

Oh, honey. Yeah. Stanley
warned us it might happen.

I just wanted to wait until he
was sure before I said anything.

This meant everything to Parker.

I know, but there were, like,
what, four kids in the class?

There's five.
Five.

Five is not enough
to justify the cost.

I'm sorry.
[Abe] I'm sorry, son.

But how did Gail do?

She's got a way of making
things better, I guess.

What's this now?

Jeremy got the girl with
the bus to teach the kids.

Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

Gail, huh?

Like the wind.

Gail this, Gail that.

She's been here all of 12 hours.

Can y'all talk
about anything else?

Hey there, Scarlet.

How's the build comin'?

It's fine.

Uh, we were... We were
just discussing that.

We were talking about how
well it's coming along...

and what a great view.
Yeah. Yeah.

That's great, Van.

Blueberry peach.

Just how you guys like it.

Thank you, Scarlet.


[Scarlet sighs]

[pleasant music playing]

Livin' the dream.

Wow.

Thought I'd sneak by and get away with
spending a few more nights in there.

Guess not.
Mm-mm.

What are you doing
with my stuff?

Uh, I just put it in the box.

You can't stay in there
no more, unfortunately,

but my parents, they own a studio a
couple blocks away. You could stay there.

bunch of stuff layin' around.

Haven't had time to fix
it up to rent it out,

but it's got four
walls and a roof.

Ah... You'll be okay, old girl.

She better be in good hands.

She's in great hands.

My bus, I call her Jewel.

She's the only home
I've ever known.

Well, she is a gem.

I'm glad someone agrees with me.

What happened?

Splinter.

My tip box, it...

Yeah.
Tip box?

Someone really
special gave it to me.

I take it to all my gigs,

but it broke in the crash.

Sorry.

Speakin' of sorries,
I owe you one.

I was pretty mean the other
day when you came in there.

Any mention of big cities
makes my skin crawl.

So, sorry.

Apology accepted.

You weren't that bad.

I was pretty bad.

So, let me make it up to ya.

Take you to dinner now, and
go look at the studio later?

You know a way to a girl's
heart. I'm starving.

[upbeat music playing]

Smells good.


Oh! [laughs]

Of course.

It's you! Well...

Okay, my sons Johnny and Jeff...

they told me all about
their new music teacher.

They said, "She's
not a real teacher,

but she can sing and play
piano just like Beyonce."

And I said, "Does
Beyonce play piano?"

And they said, "If she did,
she'd play just like Miss Gail."

And then I said to myself,

"How do I know that name?
Why do I know that name?"

And now I get it. [laughs]

Let me get you a table.

Bruce! Get the
sauce by the door.

Come on, honey. This way, we're
goin' right to this table right here.

hear she almost hit Eddie?


No!
Yeah, right here.

You happened to Eddie?

Guilty. Guilty.
No. It's okay, darlin'.

Listen, that alpaca is
like half deer. I swear.

Something comes at
it, it just like...

Deer in headlights.

[both laughing]

[Rachael] Whoo!
[all laughing]

I'm just messing
with you, darlin'.


So, where you headin'
once your bus is done?

I have a gig in LA.
Oh!

And if it all goes well,
I'll tour all over the world.

She'd be on her way
to being a big deal.

Well, that's a huge
deal. With who?

They'll pair us with
the right fit, you know.

It's a good thing I'm used
to living on the road.

Well, listen. I am gonna get
you the Lumberjack platter.

You know, just a little
bit of everything.

No, no, no. Come on
now, that feeds six.

You can take some
home. [laughs]

Lumberjack platter?
What is that?

It's just a whole lot of food.

Plus, it'll make a great
photo for your Instagram.

I'm surprised you even
know what that is.

I ain't livin' in a hole here.

I gave it up.

I gave up all my social media.

Color me intrigued.

Sometimes when things aren't
working, you unplug for a bit

before you plug back in.
Hmm.

Life's no different.

I haven't been this
unplugged since I was eight.

Well, here we go.

Oh, boy.
Two Oklahoma extra oma palomas.

Now, you tell your friends
in LA about that. [laughs]

Wow.

To LA.

Oh, so now you're
pro big cities?

Can't make it big without
a big city, right?

Cheers.

Cheers.


know, I wasn't lying.

It's pretty messy in here.
[laughing]

Now, I know it's not much,

but it's warm.

And bathroom's back there, so...

If Rachael's barbeque wasn't
so good, I'd be outta here.

Um, I know there's some fresh
sheets in one of these boxes...

No, no, no. Not this one.

This one?
Yeah, I believe so.

I mean, I know there used to be.

Here you go. Oh.

[Jeremy clears throat]

Thanks.
Yeah.


Forgot to ask you,

uh, what song were
you teaching the kids?

Uh, never got that far.

This being our last song, I don't
know, pick something special.

Hmm.

Sounds like you miss it.

Kinda. Even if the
kids are awful.

Hey. They are not awful.

They're just...

unpolished.

Well, uh, the kids...

they're the heart of this town.

And the word is they
really love you.

That reminds me,
um, Stanley called,

so I guess your class
starts at 8:00 a.m.

I thought this was an
after-school thing?

Mm-mm. Christmas
break. Next two weeks.

So, good luck.
Hmm...

8:00 a.m.

When am I gonna write my song?

Miss Travers? Ew!

Uh, sorry. I'm just bringin'
in the rest of your stuff.

This, uh...

This good here?

Great.
Cool. Um...

Yeah. Good night.

Good night.

[dishes clattering]

Something smells really good.

[clicking tongue
and humming tune]

[Van] Well, good mornin'.
[Jeremy] Good mornin'.

About time y'all woke up.

[Abe] What do we have here?
[Van] It smells so good.

I know. I was
trying to be quiet.

[Van laughing]

Look at that.
Wow.

Whoa. [chuckles]

Thank you.
[Jeremy] Mm-hmm.

famous Jeremy flapjacks?


Boy.
Here you go, Mom.

'Cause you know first
one's always yours.

I have missed this.

Thank you.

Look at him.


[Rosemary clears throat]
Ooh.

Everything okay?

Uh, I have to write
my very own song.

A song good enough to impress some
of the best music people out there.

So,

it has to be perfect.

The animals on our
farm are messy.

Pretty imperfect, but I still
think they're beautiful.

Cracks happen in our lives just
to let the light in. You know?

You give the best advice.

What would you say to someone
who has a beautiful voice,

but they're scared
of showing it off?

the first cubbyhole.

The first book... Yeah, I
know, but I just don't like...

It's time to get focused.

Focusing.

Today we're gonna focus on the
instrument we already have. Our voice.

All right?

Everyone, get up.
Stand up. Get up.

Close your eyes.
Close 'em. Close 'em.

Now, place your hands
over your heart.

Breathe in.

[all inhaling deeply]

Breathe out.

[all exhaling deeply]

This is where you sing from.

Not your head or your lungs.

Your heart.

Now, set an intention.

How do you wanna
feel when you sing?

Now, stretch your arms
out in front of you...

and release it out
into the universe.

I feel it.

Someone's intention
smells like a fart.

Release your intentions
through your mouths.


Come on. Keep your focus!

Thank you, Sarah.

Okay, today we're gonna try
singing a simple A note.

One at a time. Just
like this, okay?

<i>â™ª La Benjamin, you first â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Try and match my pitch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª La â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª La â™ª</i>

That was great.

All right.

Believe it or not, an A can sound
different for someone with a lower voice.

Like Benjamin.

Johnny and Jeff, your
turn. Let's hear it.

<i>â™ª La â™ª</i>


Okay.

Playing to your strengths.
I love it. Love it.

Rosemary, your turn.

Just an A note.

Easy-peasy.

<i>â™ª La â™ª</i>

Mm-hmm. Okay, I
think I can hear it.

You just need to
get a little louder.

<i>â™ª La â™ª</i>

That was beautiful.

You just gotta get
it a little louder.

Don't worry. You're not
gonna scare anyone away.

All right, Miss Opera
singer, let's hear it.

[clears throat]


Wow. Wow.

Okay. Okay. Shh, shh.

We are gonna work on that.

All right, I have to
write my very own song

for a big show I have coming up

and I'm having a hard time.

What if we all write a Christmas
song together for the gala?

I could use the practice.

Do we have enough time for that?

Well, it doesn't
have to be perfect.

It just has to be ours.
[schoolbell rings]

[both] See ya.
Bye.

Great job today.

Bye.
Bye.

Hey, Sarah.

Everything okay?

I know I can't sing.

I've been trying

and I know I act like I'm good

but it's just pretend and I'm
not good at anything at all.

Hey.

Sarah, that's not true.

I bet you're good
at a lot of things.

You know what? I'm gonna
be gone for the show.

I'm gonna need someone to
be in charge while I'm away.

I think you would be
really good at that.

At what?

Making things happen.

We need lights,

stage direction, every
detail of the performance

needs to be organized.

That's what a
stage manager does.

Stage manager?

Mm-hmm. The best operas,

they're run by the best
stage managers in the world.

We're gonna need
someone really good

to be the boss.

Then call me "boss," boss.
Give me some.

Bye.
Bye.

Oh. [laughs]

Well, I can see why
he likes you so much.

Who?

Oh, you know exactly who.

What about Scarlet?

Let's just say it takes two
to agree to be a couple,

not just one.

Girl's been after him
since grade school.

Oh! Oh, how much
longer do we have you?

You know what?

I don't wanna know.

You want some cake?

Bruce! Get the cake!

[pleasant music playing]

[knocking at door]

Come in.

Hey.
Hi.

I, uh...

You never came in to
check on Jewel today,

so I just wanted to make
sure everything was okay.

Mm-hmm, I'm working
on some lyrics.

I have two songs to write now.

Oh, you're... You're
doin' an original song.

Mm-hmm.

The, um, last teacher
we had do that...

uh, kids really loved it, so...

Um...

Got you something.


An empty box.

It's a send-back box.

You put your broken phone inside

and they you send it out and
they mail you a brand-new one.

Actually, you know what? I can mail
it out for you tonight if you want.

You got the phone?

You know, I don't even know

where my phone is right now,
if you can believe that.

Oh, here it is.

Perfect.

I'll let you get back to it.

Yeah. Um...

You know, actually if you
get a break or something,

you know, later on
if you're hungry,

I know a great place for dinner.

Yes. Yes, I could eat that
barbeque sandwich every meal.

No, I was actually thinking of
something a little more close to home.

Hmm.

Okay.

Cool.

I'll, uh, see you later.

See you later.

This was so good.

Girl could stick around
for this kinda cooking.

So, you live here?

For now. It's just easier while
I build it for my parents.

This could be the sweetest
thing you could do for someone.

These walls you've created will hold
your family's most precious moments.

Never really thought
about it like that.

You should tell me
about your family.

I, uh...

I never knew my parents.

I never had a house.

I was a foster kid.

I grew up in the system
from the day I was born.

Run of bad luck got me
bounced around several times

until I hit 18.

I had my guitar, my music...

that was my home.

Sorry.

It wasn't all that bad.

I had this one foster dad

who taught me how
to ground myself

before I sing, you know.

Use the nervous butterflies
to find my voice.

Did he create the tip box?

Yes, he did.
Figured.

Where is he?

He moved to Canada...

without me, um, for a
business opportunity.

Foster kids can't
leave the country,

and we lost touch.

That's the system for you.

But what about you?

Childhood out here
must've been pretty great.

Yeah.

I mean, look.

Yeah, we had the biggest
house up on a hill, you know.

Nothing but green for
miles. It was great.

But we couldn't stay.

Not after my brother died.

But this, it's the least I
can do for taking him away.

Taking him away?

He was the star of
the music program.

Yeah. I mean, he
actually started it.

His voice was so good, Gail.

Like yours.

You know, which is why
I pushed him so hard.

I had this plan.

You know, go out to LA so
he can chase his dream.

I mean, I just got so
caught up in it all.

Became so self-centered.

And what happened?

We were at a party...

and it was getting late.

He had a gig the
next day, early,

and he was exhausted,

so I just threw him the keys.

And, uh, he...

probably fell
asleep at the wheel.

Hit a curb, lost
control, and that was it.

Last time I saw my brother.

I'm so sorry, Jeremy.

So, you went home,

and put on all your jackets?

What I'm doing is trying to fill
the hole that he left behind.

Parker was everything
to Harmony Springs.

Well, you can't blame yourself.


The reason why I stayed is because
Coldplay was gonna be there.

And I just wanted to
take a picture with them

to impress some girl
that I didn't even know.


Because of it,

we never got to see my brother
again over some stupid post.

Yeah, now, um...

[smacks lips]

Now, I get the whole
smartphone thing.

Hmmm.

I know what you
must think of me.

Desperate to update my story

for a whole bunch of
people I've never even met.

No.

I mean, it's a priority
for your career. I get it.

Hmm.

I'll tell you what, though.

I like the unplugged
Gail a whole lot better.

I do, too.

[indistinct chatter]

Did he kiss her yet?
I don't know.

Are they 12 years old?

This is too much.

Oh, man.

Wanna look at the stars?
Yeah.

<i>â™ª It's cold â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's cold outside â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's cold â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's cold outside â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We could light
a fire tonight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, from one, two, three â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You and me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Stars in the ocean â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª May turn into stone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The world keeps on spinning â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Far as we know â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All of the mornings â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They come and go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll be your shelter â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You'll be my
home, Home, home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Always you and me
Always you and me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We are home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I'll be your home â™ª</i>

You leave so soon.
Yeah.


Not so good.

She's a crier.

So, with this
singing gig you have,

what happens after the show?

Well, she's actually
gonna hit the road.

She's gonna go on tour now.

And yeah. She'll be on her
way to becoming a huge star.

Making some albums
and all that jazz.

Wow.
Hmm.

Yeah.

I spent my whole life
on the road, so...

kinda used to it.

So, who's gonna finish
getting the kids ready?

He's sitting right next to me.

Oh.
[Gail laughs]

Okay.
Our son?

Uh-uh. I do not think so.

That boy cannot sing a lick.

Don't worry. They're ready.

You have to get them
on the stage, okay?

Yeah. Gotcha.

He'll do it.

I'm gonna miss you all so much.

I should get going. I have
a few more things to pack,

finish the song.

I'll see you later, yeah?

Yeah, see you later.
Okay.

Here, no. I got
it. I'll get this.

First time in his life.
Go.

Go on now. Git!

-Thank you for dinner. It was delicious.
-[Abe] Thank you.

[Van] You're welcome.
[Abe] So glad you could come.

[Gail singing] <i>â™ª Christmas
trees and Mistletoe â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª City windows all aglow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Reindeers stuck
inside A globe â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All of these are wonderful â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All of these are beautiful â™ª</i>

Yeah.

This is Christmas.

[knocking at door]
Come in.


Am I interrupting something?

I just wanted to make
sure I bid my farewell.

What are you doing for Jer?

What?

You're not giving him a
thank you of any kind?

He's the gesture type.

I've been so busy, I didn't
even think about that.


You live in your van, right?

Mm-hmm.

So you're good
with small spaces.

Why don't I help you set
some of this stuff up?

Oh, my gosh.

Look.

I remember this being
right about here.

You sure he won't mind?

Girl, he's been dying to
tidy up this space. Trust me.

He did say they
haven't had time...

Exactly!

It'll take less than
an hour. Come on.

Oh, I just love this.

Perfect.

I love these movies.

Don't you love these movies?

Love you, Mom.

I love you.

[knocking at door]

Door's open.

Hi.

Thank you.

What... What did you do?

You said you hadn't
had time to fix it up

so I put it all together.

Why? Why... Why
would you do this?

I wanted to thank you.
No.

Make it look nice, I...

[door slams]
Jeremy!

[knocking at door]


Is Jeremy here?
Come on.

Come on in.
I really messed up here.

All right, breathe.
Breathe, okay?

Breathe, okay? Sit
down. Sit down.

Breathe. Breathe,
breathe. Okay.

Talk to me.
Scarlet said it would be a good idea.

Scarlet?

that girl a run for her money.

She's been after Jeremy since
the day that she decided

boys did not have cooties.

What happened?

We decided to fix up the studio
with a bunch of boxed up stuff.

You know, I thought it would be
a nice thing to do before I left.

Parker's studio?


I could never get him
out of that place.

He was always writing somethin'.

That explains why I've had such
good luck with my songwriting.

I've never felt so inspired.

Maybe it's not just the studio.

It must've been such a shock.

You know, seeing the
studio the same way it was

when Parker was alive.

I should've known.

There was all this music stuff
everywhere. I should've known.

Honey, honey, your
intentions were good.

Abe and I were...
[voice breaking]

We were lucky we had each
other when it happened.

Jeremy...

he just isolated.

He just threw himself
into his work, you know,

and he didn't give himself
time to process it and...

They say that there's nothing
worse than losing a child,

and I lost two that day.

Two.
I'm sorry, Van.

I'm so sorry.

He's come up for air for
the first time in years.

He's cooking again,

and he's playing
music when he works.

And there's a light
right back in his eyes.

And the only thing
that has changed...

is you being here.

Okay? It's gonna be okay.

I made you some tea.

Come on, it's
late. Take a break.

[clears throat]

We all miss him, you know.

Jeremy.

Jeremy?

Look at me.

Son...

you have been
drowning for so long

that you don't even feel it

when you pull the people that are
the closest to you into the undertow.

We all loved him.

So much.

But he would not want to
see you behaving this way.

I shouldn't have snapped at her.

It happens.

The question is, what
are you gonna do now?

[pleasant music playing]

[notification tones]

[clears throat]

Hey, guys. It's Gail.
I'm still in Oklahoma.

I've been, uh...

I...

I have nothing to say to
a faceless piece of glass.

I know. I know. I'm late.

IHeart Radio, they sent an...

Sent an email.

As stage manager,

I hereby declare the first
quarter of this class

dedicated to Jeremy Crawford

and his heart-felt
sincerest apology.

Hit it, Jeff.

<i>â™ª I'm sorry â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm sorry â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm sorry â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm sorry â™ª</i>



Say yes.

We wanted to give you
something special.

To remember us by.

Hope it fits.

What is this?

I sewed the snowman on myself.

Your Christmas tradition.

It's the same one.

Thank you.

Aw. Thank you, guys.

<i>â™ª Christmas tradition, yo â™ª</i>

Guys, this is
amazing. Thank you.

My tip box.

It may help.

I'm sorry for how I reacted.

Look at these.

Scarlet said that...
You know what? Doesn't matter.

You were right, I was wrong.

Well, a girl loves to hear that.


All right.

Hey. This county doesn't
know what's coming for them.

Okay?

Whatever happens at the gala...

just know you already
won in my eyes.

Here.

Don't peek.
Doing.

Go ahead.

Wow.

She's beautiful.

Yeah. Yes, she is.

Here.

Got something for ya.

What job's this one from?

Oh, no. This one's
actually mine.

I was thinking you could hold
onto it for me for a while...

and take it with
you on your travels.

Uh, you said something in
class earlier about iHeart.

Yes. They need a good recording
of my song, but I, uh...

I don't have anyone
to help me record it.

Mm.
[Gail strumming guitar]

<i>â™ª It's not the
stars On the tree â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Or the glitter and
gold I was missing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª This is Christmas â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª This is Christmas â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª This is Christmas â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, to me â™ª</i>


Gail, that was, uh...

That was beautiful.
It was really amazing.

Thank you.

Well,

it sent, so...

Thank you.

[guitar music playing]

I think it's time we
take off some jackets.


Good mornin'.

We need to talk.

[indistinct conversation]

I'm sorry. I should've been
honest with you sooner.

You should've.

Look, I'm sorry I pushed you
so much, Jeremy. I just...

I really thought
we'd end up together.

Scarlet...

we just weren't
right for each other.

I'm sorry.

You got a huge
place in my heart.

Always.

Bye, Jer.

[exhales sharply]


[clears throat]

Was this all some game to you?

What?

Am I some fling? To
make Scarlet jealous?

Some toy in your complicated
relationship? I mean, we just...

Why did I trust you?

It's not what you think.

I know what I saw.

Does it matter?

I mean...

you were always on
borrowed time here, Gail.

What is that supposed to mean?

The world needs to hear
that voice of yours.

You can't do that from here.

What you did last night...

you don't belong here.

There's nothin' for you here.



I don't want you here, Gail.

[sighs]
So, that's it then?

This is how we say goodbye?



My phone got destroyed.</i>

Um, I crashed Jewel.

I'm on my way to LA,

and, boy, do I have
a story for you.

I go live Christmas Eve.


[exhales sharply]
<i>- â™ª So go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With the wind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I won't try to stop you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And it doesn't mean â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That I don't want to... â™ª</i>

Is she gone?


Couldn't have been
the reason she stayed.

[sighs softly]

You should've heard her sing.

Oh, honey.

I'm sorry.

<i>â™ª Go your own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll stay here and cry â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just go your own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I'll stay here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And die â™ª</i>

[man 1] Gail Travers has
landed. Miss Travers has landed.

Hey, you Miss Travers?
Hi.

Great.

Follow me.

[man 2 over radio]
<i>What's your 20?</i>

[man 1] Stepping in.

Thank you.

[woman 1] Well, you know, I never
thought I'd be sitting here in this chair

ready for the new Sia album

and a mystery Christmas album at that.
[woman 2] I know, right?

But we like to keep things
interesting around here.

[woman 1] We sure do.
And you know what,

we're gonna take a
quick commercial break

and when we come back,
we're gonna talk about

our big Christmas Eve Special

and our five lucky
opening guests.


Let me see that video again.

Yeah. It's so good.

<i>â™ª Was missing â™ª</i>


<i>-â™ª This is Christmas â™ª</i> -[Sisanie
exclaims] Can't wait to meet her.

Have all five landed yet?


Hi.
Hi, I'm Miles.

With EP Records.
Nice to meet you.

Once iHeart puts you on the map,

we, the record label, will
take care of everything else.

And I sense a real
fast track to success.

I'm serious. It's in the

questions on the intro segment.

Can you handle that?
Already done.

Thank you.


Break a leg.
Thanks.

Gail Travers?

Hi, I'm Sisanie.
Hi.

So nice to meet you.

We're so excited that you're

Can we get a jacket?

-The look, it's... It's just not clicking for me.
-Flying in a jacket.

Fast, fast, fast.

Okay.



No, this is actually really cute.
That's...

My blood sugar's low.

I don't know, I'm all over the place.
That's Sarah, by the way.

Then who's Tiffany?
You fired her.

That does track.

Oh, you can go up now.
Mm.

[Walker chuckles] Lose the bag.

[indistinct chatter]

[Amy] Really?
[Sisanie] Just watch this.


<i>â™ª Christmas trees
And mistletoe â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All of those are
Beautiful, but â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Pretty paper
Pretty bows can't â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Keep you warm Or
hold you close â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Can't whisper to
you That you're home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Even though They're
wonderful... â™ª</i>

I feel like... I feel like
something's a little off.

<i>â™ª Nothing compares to this
Feeling I'm feeling right now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I was so lost in the blue But
I feel like I'm finally found â™ª</i>

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just need
a moment. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Sorry, sorry.
Okay. What, what's goin' on?

-Excuse me.
-[Miles] What are we doin' here?

I just need a minute. I
need... I need a minute.

Kirsty? Kirs...
My name is Gail!

Oh.
It's Gail.

Gail.
I need to... I need to go to the bathroom.

-Okay.
-[Miles] All right, great. Just get back soon.



[line ringing]

There.

-We won't need it.
-We could make us... That's true.

We won't need it.
Well, maybe, we won't.

[clears throat] Hello?

Hello?

Don't, who is it? Don't
tell me you have to

go to the shop.
Oh, hey, honey.

It's Gail. Hey,
hey, hey, honey.

<i>Are you okay? Is
everything all right?</i>

How many times have
you asked me that now?

Hurry up.

I sure wish I could
see your face.

You're gonna need a
new phone for that.

What's goin' on?

I didn't know who else to call.

I don't know what
to do. Everything...

Everything here is
just so different.

What do you mean?

<i>There's just so many
people. So many people.</i>

They're just trying
to plan my style,

my identity, my future...

There's just so many voices

that I feel like
I'm losing mine.

Oh.

Okay.

When you started singing,

what did you want
out of all of it?

<i>What do you mean?</i>

I want to sing
because I love it.

But why this way?

Fans.

Because?

Well, they're the only ones
who ever stuck around for me.

Oh.

That's not what fans are for,
that's what family's for.

<i>Now I know that you didn't have
one for a very long time...</i>

but now, you have us.

<i>And sweetheart, no matter how far,
no matter how long you're gone,</i>

<i>you can always come
back here, Gail.</i>

Harmony Springs is here for you.

<i>And listen, if those fans don't
love you for who you truly are...</i>

<i>I don't think you
really want this.</i>

Maybe you're right.

I'm probably overstepping here,

but, um, Jeremy told
me what happened.

<i>And I just... I just
need you to know that</i>

it wasn't what you thought.

<i>Jeremy told Scarlet
how he really felt...</i>

<i>about you.</i>

He just didn't wanna
be the reason that

you second-guess
this opportunity.

Okay. Well, we love you.

I love you, too.

All of you in Harmony Springs.

<i>- Oh, Van?</i>
Yeah?

Could you remind the kids
to sing from the heart

<i>tonight at the gala? The county
is not gonna know what hit 'em.</i>

I just wish that I could
be there to see it.

Thank you.

Bye.

[door creaks open]

[faucet running]
She's right, you know.

Your mom.

Oh, she's not...
She's not my...

Anyway, um, I'm sorry that
you had to hear all that.

You don't have to explain.

I've been exactly where you are.

But, Gail, you're good.

I mean, really good.

With or without
that record label.

Thank you.

And do you know how many times
people have tried to get me

to be cuter, girlier,

more country, less
country. I mean...

I can't keep up.

But I learned to hold on to
my favorite version of myself.

So you've got to hang on
tight to what makes you you.

You have to remember
that's what got you here.

And I promise if you do that,
Gail, the sky's the limit.

Thank you, Amy.

My travel agent's info,
it's in your inbox.

So, I want you to know, if
you need to get to that gala,

you got a plane ticket,
you got a car service.

Seriously, whatever
you need you decide.

But what about my bus?
It's handled.

Done.

Good luck, Gail Travers.

Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

Us girls gotta stick together.

Yeah.

'Kay, bye.


think I have an idea.


[cell phone ringing]

[clears throat]

Hello?

<i>Ma'am, this is Amy
Brown from iHeart Radio.</i>

<i>I'm thinking maybe you can
help me with somethin'.</i>

Deep breath.

Release your intentions.

I'm sure those are really
great intentions, guys.

You made it!
Yes!

How in the world could I
miss it? You guys look great!

Wow.

Okay, people. Look alive.
We're on in three minutes.

Okay, let's all head toward
backstage, okay? Come on.

Come on.
Okay. Come on, people.

I'll be there in a minute.
Come on. Let's go, let's go...

Okay.

Hey, what's goin' on, Rosemary?

It's just, there's... There's
a lot of people out there.

Our class was small and...

I can't sing in front
of that many humans.

Hey. Hey...

You taught me that being
perfect isn't better.

Whatever happens out there,

it's you.

And I haven't met one single
human who hasn't loved you.

Show 'em you, okay?

You got this.

You know...

the whole "If you love
her, let her go" thing...

doesn't work every time.

Sorry. That whole, uh...

[clears throat] That
whole Scarlet thing...

I know.

I know.

You... You know I took
Parker from his dream.

Couldn't do that with you.

He made a choice and
now I'm making one.

I always hoped that somehow my singing
would bring me to a home of my own.

I've never felt more loved
or seen than I do right here.

I always thought that I couldn't
write songs because I wasn't good...

but now I realize that I
just needed something...

someone to write songs about.

What's your plan?
Here's my plan.

I stick around and keep
teaching the music program,

if you'll have me.

Uh, I can't do that. We
just gave the job away.

Oh, man.

I'm kidding.
[chuckles]

You might just save the program.

Speaking of which,
we... We'd better go.

Come on, we got a show to watch.

Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.
