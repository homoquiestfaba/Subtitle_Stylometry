NARRATOR: It began as 
 a summer adventure.

We came to Transylvania 
 to study

the folklore of vampires.

We chanced upon an ancient 
 malevolent creature named

Radu, who coveted the 
 bloodstone, to which his

brother, Stefan, was 
 rightful heir.

I loved Stefan.

His heart was noble.

In vengeance, Radu slaughtered 
 my friends and mingled his

blood with mine.

Stefan destroyed him with a 
 stake through the heart,

infused me with his own 
 blood and lay me down

to be reborn a vampire.



Forgive me, Brother.

The bloodstone is mine.


Ah.



[heavy breathing]

Live long to me now, 
 pretty one.

Ah.

Ah!

[crickets chirping]

[owl hoots]

[crickets chirping]

[owl hoots]




[sobs softly]

[bone crackling]


[heavy footsteps]


[casket closes]

The bloodstone.

You bastard.

The bloodstone!

You bastard!


Bastard!


You will suffer dearly 
 for this.

[drum music playing]

[Radu breathing]

[Radu breathing]

[speaking romanian]

I need to make an international 
 call.

You must pay in dollars.

Yes.

[speaking romanian]

OK.

Wait there please.

Miss, miss?

Your call.

[phone rings]

[phone rings]

Hello?

OPERATOR: Just a 
 moment for your call please.

BECKY: Hello?

Becky?

Michelle?

Are you back already?

I want to come home.

Michelle, what's wrong?

 to be like him, Becky.

Be like who?

He bit me.

What are--are 
 you talking about?

Listen to me, if there is a 
 problem why don't you just

call the police?

No, no, no, I need did you.

Please come.

OK, calm down.

Where are you?

Bucharest, The Hotel Bucharest 
 please come.

I need you.

OK, 
 don't go anywhere.

I'll be there as soon as 
 I can get a flight.

OK, OK.

B--Becky?

Please hurry.



[Radu emanating sound]


[WOMAN SINGING, GROWLING 
 INCANTATIOUSLY]


Hmm, hmm, You.

You are forbidden here.

Mommy, have you no love in 
 your heart for your most

faithful son?

Curse you, Radu.

Leave my abode.

I bring you a sacred gift.

The blood of my father.

The king is but a memory.

And the bastard boy?

Dust.

The bloodstone, 
 give it to me.

The bloodstone was 
 stolen from me.

My Stefan's gone [inaudible].

Kill her.

Kill her.

And bring me the prize.

I'll bring you the 
 bloodstone.

But I cannot kill her.

You defy me?

I mingled my blood with hers.

I'll have her for 
 my plaything.

Come here, Radu.

Give me your hand.

Return to your father's 
 castle this night.

Burn the dead ones in a fire of 
 black thorn and cast their

ashes to the north wind.

Remain you there until 
 the moon is full.

For there will be horror.

Go at once!

But Mommy, the sun 
 draws light.

I will lie here and 
 leave at sunset.

No.

It is forbidden.

Go.

This instant.

[Michelle screaming]

Ah!

[classical music playing]

[Radu emanating sound]

[tribal music playing]

[classical music playing]

Money?

Yes.

Oh, oh, there you go.

[children begging]

I'm sorry.

I don't have any more.

Move on.

Can I help you?

Yes, please.

I'm looking for Michelle 
 Morgan.

Could you tell me she's 
 registered here?

One moment please.

May I help you?

Yes, I'm--I'm looking 
 for Michelle Morgan.

Could you tell me if 
 she's here please?

If you would be so 
 kind, sit there.

Someone will be soon 
 to help you.

Sit there.

[tires squeal]

[tires squeal]

Hello.

Hello.

Do you speak English, yes?

Yes, do you?

Mm, not so much.

I know from TV.

Um, Columbo, Streets of San 
 Francisco, Big Bird.

It's funny, that 
 Big Bird, yeah?

Uh, yeah.

Uh, you are looking for 
 Michelle Morgan, yes?

Oh my god, what's wrong?

Uh, Mel Thompson, US Embassy.

Has something happened 
 to Michelle?

Uh, please, don't 
 get excited.

Everything's going 
 to be just fine.

Please sit.

Uh, now, what is your 
 relationship to Ms. Morgan?

Um, um, she's my sister.

Your name please?

May I see passport?

Rebecca Morgan.

Here, who're you?

Uh, this is Lieutenant Marin 
 of the Bucharest Police.

And as I said it earlier, I'm 
 Mel Thompson, US Embassy Now,

this may sound a little 
 strange but yesterday

afternoon, your sister Michelle 
 was found unconscious

in her hotel room.

Then she walked away from scene 
 of the accident and

disappeared.

We think she may be suffering 
 from shock.

She appeared to be dead.

I examined her myself.

Obvious misdiagnosis 
 Lieutenant.

On behalf of the Department 
 of Police I apologize for

terrible mistake.

According to witnesses 
 at the accident, she

did not appear injured.

Now, we are confident she's 
 going to turn up.

Your sister's possessions.

One thing more.

Do you know, what is this?

Uh, it looks like some 
 kind of um, antique?

Looks expensive, huh?

You're not accusing her of 
 stealing it, are you?

Oh, no, no, no, no.

No evidence is stolen.

But before leaving Romania 
 show us the receipt.

Of course.

I'm sure Michelle has 
 it somewhere.

Thank you.

For you.

Thank you.

Nothing.

We will uh, find her.

But if you see first, 
 call me, yeah?

Ha, let's go my friend.

[women singing]

[women singing]

Yes, please, has Rebecca Morgan 
 checked in there yet?

[phone rings]

[phone ringing on other end]

Uh, hello?

[dial tone]

[eerie music playing]

[voices whispering]

MAN WHISPERING: 
 You are nevermore.

[heavy metal music playing]

(SINGING FROM INSIDE CLUB)

 grave he will rise.

You ride the night shrouded 
 in your desecrated veil.

You bring the sleep upon 
 your lips so pale.

Baptised in flame your 
 soul won't be reborn.

Entrapped, the souls cry 
 beneath the gravestone.

[heavy metal music playing]

 in heaven?

Do you believe in hell?

Do you believe in all 
 the things this

world will never tell?

It came to me in a dream, 
 nightmare of despair.

Shapes of memory haunt me now, 
 no faith you can ever repair.

[heavy metal music playing]

[crying softly]

Home.

Please, have some, Polenka.

I make it myself.

Uh, no thanks, Professor.

I'm on duty.

Thank you.

What is it?

Polenka, plum brandy.

A Romanian special too.

Noroc.

Mm, it's delicious.

Strongest alcohol 
 known to man.

Well, excuse me, Professor, but 
 about the American girls?

Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.

Madame Ovila and her 
 two friends.

They are in a monastery at 
 Prejmer doing research in the

neighboring villages.

What exactly did their 
 research involve?

Vampires, the legends 
 of Castle Vladislav.

Professor, could you tell 
 us what this is?

Hmm.

Hmm, interesting.

Once upon a time perhaps 
 I could have told you.

But now, sad to say, my memory 
 is going bye-bye.

Professor, is there 
 a telephone

there a--at the monastery?

Telephone? (LAUGHS)

Uh, then maybe you can show 
 it to us on the map?

Yes, yes, of course.

Let's see, Campoverde, 
 [inaudible]

highway here.

Monastary, here.

It's not easy to find.

But if you like, I'll come 
 along, show you the way and

have a Polenka with my 
 old friend Carl.

[music playing]

Uh, professor?

Huh?

Wake up, we're here.

Oh, oh, oh yes, yes, yes.

Carl!

Carl [inaudible], come and say 
 hello to your old friend

Nicolei Popescu.

Hello?

Is anybody here?

Michelle?

Mara?

Lilian?

[car horn beeps]

[ringing bell]

Hello!

Michelle?

Castle Vladislav, home of the 
 legendary king of vampires.

Wow, does anybody 
 live in there?

Not for many, many years.

The descendents lie 
 in tombs there.

And it belongs to the 
 Vladislav family.

But they left Romania a 
 long, long time ago.

Huh, let's go and see the older 
 part of the castle.

The descendants of Vladislavs 
 lie buried here in

unconsecrated ground.

Professor, what exactly is the

legend of Castle Vladislav?

An obscure old story about King 
 Vladislav, the vampire,

who made piece with the 
 people of the region.

I remember he had two sons.

But sad to say, I forgot 
 the details.

But don't worry.

I have it in a book somewhere.

What in the world?

That's a fresh grave.

No, professor, wait for us.

Oh, watch out.

Yes, please, be careful.

Wait, Professor, where 
 are we going?

This is my own secret 
 way into castle.

Want to come have 
 a look around?

I really don't think we 
 should go in there.

Why not?

It's unoccupied.

I am director of historical 
 museum.

I'm sure, Ms. Morg--

I would love to see 
 it, professor.

Good.

Nicolai Popescu comes 
 prepared, huh?

Come.

[ominous music playing]

This is a secret passageway 
 to main path of castle.

I discovered it years ago when 
 I was with the university.

Oh, man.

Now we are below the castle.

I think it's getting kind 
 of late professor.

Maybe we ought to head back.

Soon, my friend, soon.

The throne room is somewhere 
 on this level.

Someone's here.

You know, it's getting 
 dark you guys.

I think we should leave.

[Radu emanating sound]

[Radu emanating sound]

Michelle?

Lillian?

BECKY: Lillian?

Mara?

Anybody hear me?

[radu emanating sound]

Oh, you dared to enter 
 my father's house?

I've been told that this 
 place is deserted.

Please forgive us.

I am Nicolai Popescu, director 
 of historical museum.

Trespassers are 
 forbidden here.

Leave my house at once.

Yes, sir, we're very sorry.

Thank you.

Bye-bye.

Jesus, who was that guy?

A Vladislav, I suppose, come 
 to reclaim his heritage.

BECKY: Well, 
 I want the police to

look into him too.

MEL: Definitely.

[Radu emanating sound]

Well, I had a marvelous day.

Call me in the morning 
 and we will

find the Book of Vladislav.

Noapte buna.

Noapte buna.

(SINGING TO HIMSELF)

[Radu emanating sound]

[voices whispering]

[woman singing]

BECKY: Thanks 
 for everything, Mel.

Well, hey, aside from the 
 fact that we committed a

felony that could get me 
 permanently banned from the

 was my pleasure.

Get some rest, OK?

I'll call you first thing 
 in the morning.

Michelle?

Michelle!

[tires squeal]

[Radu emanating sound]

Michelle!

Wait!

Michelle, stop!

Michelle!

You're scaring me.

Stay there, Becky, 
 don't look at me.

Michelle, please, tell me 
 what's going on so I can help

you.

I shouldn't have called you.

You can't help me.

I can.

But you have to tell me 
 what's happening.

I can't.

Then tell me what this is.

[Radu emanating sound]

Give it to me, Becky.

I need it.

What's wrong with 
 you, Michelle?

You look sick.

I have to go now.

Tell Mom I'm sorry.

You're cold.

[Radu emanating sound]

Radu!

No!

[Radu emanating sound]

Michelle!

[dark choral music playing]

Pitiful little goddess of the 
 temple, the bloodstone is not

for creatures such as you.

No, please.

Please leave me alone.

You are my fledgling.

Embrace me as your master 
 and all that is

mine will be yours.

You killed my friends.

Spurn me and I will torment 
 you to eternity.

Soon enough you will beg 
 me for deliverance.

Patience, pretty one.

We have all the time 
 in the world.

[Mummy whispering]

I bear you an offering, Mummy, 
 the most holy of holiest.

What troubles you, child?

My hunger.

For love.

Love is for mortals, 
 not for such as we.

I loved my brother Stefan.

And always I had not 
 taken his life.

Tormenting him was such 
 a sweet pleasure.

Stefan yearned for peace.

You were his deliverer.

Now there's only 
 my fledgling.

And she resist my mastery.

Curse Stefan for polluting 
 her with his goodness.

Destroy her before 
 she destroys you.

My desire for her 
 is more sublime.

I yearn to see her.

Stefan, to eternity.

I turned in the papers for 
 two men to investigate


If big boss approves we will 
 have answers by next week.

I saw Michelle last night.

You did?

Where?

Outside the hotel.

She tried to run away.

But I caught up with her.

She begged me for the stone.

And then she ran off again.

Terrified, like someone 
 was after her.

More and more this sounds me 
 like a case of stolen goods.

Oh, where'd you learn that?

Columbo?

No.

Perry Mason.

Popescu's secret library.

All the precious books I saved 
 from the bonfires of books.

The book of Vladislav is here 
 somewhere, somewhere.

Let's get to work.

Aha, just as I thought.

The legend of King Vladislav 
 the vampire.

Here is the story of King 
 Vlad and the bloodstone.

The bloodstone?

The bloodstone?

A mythical relic said to drip 
 blood of the saints.

A stupid story, Dracula.

Bella Lugosi was Hungarian.

Like Zsa Zsa Gabor.

What are you talking about?

Zsa Zsa Gabor.

Zsa Zsa Gabor.

Here's in an etching.

It looks similar to your 
 sister's antique.

It looks exactly like it.

Look.

Please.

Could be stolen, yes?

Perhaps.

You mean like a--a reproduction 
 or something?

Or the real thing.

Excuse me, but mythical 
 objects, by

definition, are not real.

This story tells of the rivalry 
 between King Vlad's

sons, Stefan and Radu.

Radu?

She called that name last night, 
 as if he were standing

there watching us.

Hey, come on you guys, we're 
 talking fairy tales here.

Mel, I saw her.

Whatever is going on here 
 is not a fairy tale.

[heavy metal music playing]

 this message.

I'm deep within my heart.

Now it beats no longer cause 
 you ripped it all apart.

I am no mortal.

I am not a man.

Now I'm just a memory you 
 cannot understand.

BECKY: Goodnight, 
 thank you.

[Radu emanating sound]

Thanks, Mel.

For what?

For being here.

[Radu emanating sound]

[Radu emanating sound]

[heavy metal music playing]

 kill me, I kill you.

Guess who gets the prize?

I'm dancing in the light 
 of your sweet demise.

Won't you come and join me?

Won't you come with me?

Now let's make you suffer 
 for eternity.



[man screaming]

[slurping, blood dripping]

No.




[Radu emanating sound]

[phone rings]

[phone rings]

Yes?

Becky, help me.

Michelle, what's wrong?

Where are you?

Please help me.

Tell me where and I'll 
 come get you.

The park, behind 
 the atheneum.

I'm on my way.

[speaking romanian]

Excuse me?

[speaking romanian]

Michelle?

Stay there, Becky.

Let me help you.

It's too late.

Nothing can help me now.

I killed him.

I drank his blood.

Uh--

Oh, god.


What is it?

The dawn.

Help me please.

I don't want to die.

I love you, Michelle.

You're not going to die.


[Radu emanating sound]

Radu!

No!

Please!

No!

Who are you?

What do you want?

Run, Becky, get away.

Leave with my sister alone!

[Radu emanating sound]

Embrace me fledgling.

Accept your destiny.

You will remember this 
 as a day of joy.

-Michelle, don't.

[radu emanating sound]

MICHELLE: Go home!

The castle is too far 
 to race the sunrise.

We will rest here the day 
 and--and travel by night.

Fear not pretty one, soon your 
 mortal feelings will cease to

cause you pain.

If what you say is true, the 
 vampire Radu is here in

Bucharest and your sister 
 is his disciple.

Hey, come on, you guys.

You're getting a little 
 carried away.

Look, what we should do is call 
 Lieutenant Marin and get

him over here.

And we'll tell him 
 the whole story.

Oh yeah, he'd really 
 believe us.

I'm not even sure I do.

My point exactly.

Look, there's got to be a 
 rational explanation here.

I mean, this is reality.

Vampires don't exist.

There was blood all over her.

She said she killed someone 
 and drank his blood.

I'm sorry, I don't buy it.

The man who took her, 
 he looked like

some kind of ghoul.

It was the same man we 
 saw at the castle.

I read last night, the 
 legends of Vladislav.

There is the story about the 
 sorcerer, [inaudible], consort

to King Vlad and mother to Radu, 
 who was entombed alive

in a forest near Bucharest.

If indeed Radu is stalking 
 Bucharest, this may be the

place that he will sleep.

Will you show us where 
 it is professor?

Of course.

I will accompany you.

The tools of the fearless 
 vampire hunter.

We should need them 
 for our adventure.

Are you coming, my friend?

Vampire hunting?

Afraid not, professor.

Look, Rebecca, I like you.

And I know this has been a 
 terrible strain on you.

And I want to help you 
 any way I can.

But I'm also here representing 
 the US State Department.

And what you two are proposing 
 to do, it's just plain nuts.

The bloodstone, the legend, the 
 empty grave, what does it

take to convince you?

Call me when you come 
 to your senses.

You think this is crazy, professor?

Well, yes, a little.

Because you don't believe me?

No, because I do believe you.

Here lies a prison 
 of the damned.

No man shall enter the gate, nor 
 commune with inhabitants

of this unholy place.

Maybe Mel was right.

Maybe we should just 
 call the police.

There is nothing to fear 
 in the daylight.

Oh my god.

Heaven help us.

It's true.

What do we do?


[Mummy vocalizing]

[Becky crying]

[Mummy screaming]

BECKY: 
 (SCREAMING) No!

Please no!


[Mummy cackling]

[MUMMY CACKLING, BECKY 
 CRYING, SCREAMING]

No!

Please!

Stop!

No.

Michelle.

Ah, the sleeper has arisen.

Such a sweet reunion.

Let her go.

Silence!

Fledgling, attend your master.


No.

Let her go.

Abandon your mortality 
 fledgling.

It's just solves of 
 all your pain.

[Becky screaming]

Blood is our sustenance.

But fear and suffering are the 
 true pleasures for such as we.

There's vessel here which 
 feeds the leg.

Blood springs from it 
 like a fountain.

[Becky crying]

Drink with me fledgling, 
 savor the taste of your

sister's suffering.



[Mummy wailing]

You're going to make an 
 exceptional plaything.

Give me the dagger fledgling.

It's a magical object.

You must never, ever touch it.

Give it to me.

Or I will desecrate 
 her in ways that

will haunt you forever.

[Radu emanating sound]

[Radu groaning]


Hurry!

Hurry please.

Die you bastard.

Come on Michelle.

I can't.

The sun.

I'll wait for you till dark.

[Mummy emanating sound]
