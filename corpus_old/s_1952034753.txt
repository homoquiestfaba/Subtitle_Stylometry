DR. MURRAY:
How are you feeling?

Still feeling crappy.

The biopsy
doesn't look good.

Melody,
I'm very sorry, but...

it's cancer, laryngeal...

and it's inoperable.

The tumor is malignant
and it's growing rapidly.

It's causing an obstruction
in your trachea and larynx.

[HEART POUNDING]

What will happen?

Most likely you'll
lose your voice first,

and then,
as the cancer progresses,

you will find it increasingly
more difficult to breathe.

How much time?

I would say from
the looks of things,

you have perhaps
a month or two.

Is there anything--

You need to go home,
get your affairs in order,

and then you come
back here tomorrow,

and we're gonna set you up
with a counselor, okay?

I'm sorry.

Thank you.

Hi, Melanie.

Mr. Faddis,
I'm sorry I'm late.

Listen.
You're being downsized.

What?
Fired.

In that envelope
is your severance pay.

I've been here
for four years.

Four weeks' severance pay.

That's one week for each year
you've been with the company.

I don't understand.

Four weeks is plenty of time

to find a new job
in this environment.

Good luck.

Y-yeah.

You know, I don't

Well, yeah.

No, I think they're

Listen, listen,
I need to see you.

I can't tell you

Please.

Listen, I have to see you.

Later is kind of tough.

Hey.

Mel.

I'm glad you called.

I've been thinking.

If I really,
truly loved you...

[ANGUISHED SIGH]

Um, okay. Okay.

I need some time alone.

I need some space.

I'm feeling suffocated.

I mean, not me personally,
but my life force.

Do you understand?

[AUDIO BEGINS FADING OUT]

Honey, I--

I think we need

Okay, I'll see
you later. Bye.

Miss Wilder.

Miss Wilder?

Mel Wilder.

Ah, Manny Laffs.

What's wrong
with your voice?

Laryngitis.

Well, now, you understand
this is a short-term rental.

Short, long

Yes, yes,
but this one is short.

It's actually
kind of a unique sort

of New York-style

What?

How could you

We didn't do anything.

The question is
what did you do?

Do?
What did you change?

In your life,
what did you change,

what habits,
your diet, anything?

What did I change?

I changed everything.

I've heard of
something similar,

a type of remission wherein
the person changes so much

that the tumor no longer
recognizes the body as host.

being alive.

Well, I su--

I suppose I could use
the security deposit

as this month's rent.

Then you're gonna have
to be out, okay?

[CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY]


# Call upon my soul
within my house #

with you, it would be life

And life is over there,
behind the door

I could not die
with you...

For one must wait
to shut the other's gaze down

I cannot live with you

It would be life...

And life is over there

Behind the door

Hi.

Hey, how you doin'?

Good.
What's up?

How much will you
give me for this?

Fifty bucks.

Fifty bucks?
Yeah.

I paid $425 for this.

My mommy didn't love
me either. $50.

It's not that great.

Fine.
All right.

And what
about this?

Twenty bucks on that.

This is
a very fancy chair.

It's all right.


Jeez Louise.

Billy?

So, what do you think?

Thirty bucks.

Oi, girl.
What's up?

Hi.

What, you, uh...

Nickels and dimes.

Think you've got
a few quarters

Nah, I'm just funning you.
Just funning you.

Listen, babe,
why don't you

All right?
There you go.

Uh--
No, no.

I'm just gonna run
after the old Rasta dudes,

score some dime bag,
but I'll be right back.

Roll us a fatty,
we'll fire her up

and we can jam,
yeah, all right?

You know,
I-I don't think so.

I, uh...

Uh, wait, mister?


Oh, fuck off!

Can't believe it--
COP: Hey!

BUM: All right,
