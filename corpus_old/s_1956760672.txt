Damn shame.

Damn full ride.

I can live at home and, plus,
I get to stay in lovely Squahamish.

Hell-quahamish.
It's not that bad.

Okay, it's not that good either,

I spent four of the best years of my life

And look at you,

You're right.
Stay away from the liberal arts.

Not in the over-ten-page biz.

No, I'm not trying to cheat.

Nobody is. Whose class is it for?

No, it... it's not... Um...

What's this?
A letter.

Who writes letters these days?
I... I thought it'd seem romantic.


Can't help you.
I... I just need a few words. Good ones.

I'm not writing to Aster Fl...

To some girl.

It'd be wrong. A letter is personal.
It's supposed to be authentic.

That'd be awesome.
No! I can't be you being authen...

Get a thesaurus, use spell-check.
Good luck, Romeo.

[Ellie scoffs]
No, I can pay more for authentic.

She's like all three.

So what you're trying to say is...
I'm in love with her.

Have you ever spoken to her?

I'm not good with words.

But you know you love her?

I know I think about her when I wake up.

And when I'm doing my sprints.

And when I'm eating my mom's bratwurst
and when I'm saying my prayers...

That just means you're stubborn.
Not that you're in love.

No, it's love.

Love makes you screwy.

Don't you get screwy?

No.

[Ellie sighs, mutters]
This whole section needs...

Although, that fry thing does sound good.

A dangling modifier.

Oh, I get it.

Get what?

You've never been in love.

[Paul grunts]

You want a letter about love?
I'll write you a letter about love.

One that'll make herÂ fall in love with me,
not storm off in a huff like you're doing.

[sighs]
[indistinct TV chatter in French]

[in Mandarin] This isn't even American.
How are you going to learn English?

Shh.

No, I'm sure it's good.

I didn't cheat off of him.
No, I looked up "plagiarize."

I kind of cheated off him.
I paid you!

But this is good.
How?

It's...

It's like a game.
She's, like, challenging us.

But in a good way.

So, uh...

A major downer.

Ask her to hang out.
[Ellie scoffs]

You know, uh, hanging out.

But, like, what do you do?

It would look so cute on you.

[Aster] <i>"What they really want..."
</i>Oh.

<i>"...is to make you like them."</i>

Thanks.

<i>"Not like them as in, 'I like you, '</i>

No, dating is burgers

[Paul] It's a date, not a book report.

I got two of them signed when he came
to Powell's Books last year. [chuckles]

I drove all night to get there.

Oh, uh...

Cool.

You've probably already read it.

Thought you'd like one.
Uh, yeah, totally.

No, I... I love, uh...

Nazis.

<i>I mean, like, more of those Nazis.
Am I right?</i>

Uh, speaking of Nazis...

thank you for meeting me here.

My dad...

he isn't a Nazi exactly, but, uh...

he can be pretty strict.

You know, people talk.

Um, yeah. Talk. Ugh.


It's nice...

to make a new friend, though.

Oh.

A friend.

Good.

They use Reddi-wip.

Oh.

It's, uh... from a can.

Uh... but it's okay.

What about that date wasn't bad?
You have nothing in common.

Not yet, but...

Game over.

[Paul panting] I can't give up.

[boy] Chugga chugga Chu Chu!
[Paul] Hey!

Who are you calling "Chu Chu"?
[boy] Shit, let's get out of here!

and then drive away?

Yeah, you'd better run!

What?

you're into abstract art

and repressed British literature.

Yeah.
None of that is you.

It could be. I started reading
that <i>Remains Of The Day </i>book.

Really?
Yeah. I fell asleep a few times,

but I'm still reading it.

That's gotta count for something.

There are no points for effort.

Isn't that what love is? How much effort
you put into loving someone?

[thunder rumbles]

Well, whatever love is,

we just blew it with Aster Flores.
[phone chimes]

Yes!

No, I can do this.

We can do this.

[rain pattering on roof]

Okay.

I'll pay you double.

You don't have to pay me.

Don't be weird, dude.
Why else would you do this?

No, I've got savings.


Three weeks?
You told her you're slammed

with football training.
I... I did?

Yes. Also, you're in a debate
on who's the better Hepburn.

[Mr. Chu] Who there?

[in Mandarin] Ba, did we wake you?

School project.

Hi, Ellie Chu's dad.

We don't have time to school you
on everything Aster thinks you are,

so we have to be selective.
Deep versus broad-based learning.

Huh?
<i>- </i>We spy on her,

then cram you on her greatest hits.

Oh, cool.

Are you ready for this?
Yes.


Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

Shh!

So, in <i>No Exit,</i>
three people are trapped in hell.

A door opens, but nobody leaves.

That's nuts. He can't stand these people.

A door opens and he doesn't leave?

It's a metaphor for existence.

[Paul] Nana's not trapped in hell either.
[Ellie groans]

Hey! Hey, where are you going?

The hell's got into Munsky?

<i>You're like some marvelous, distant,
well, queen, I guess.</i>

<i>You're so cool and fine.</i>

I want to be loved.</i>

Key thing about <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>
is it's a plea for tolerance.

Check this out. I'm calling it
taco sausage. Do you want a bite?

No. So tolerance...

Two hand foods, one great taste.

Conversation is like ping-pong.

I hit one and then you...

What the...

Oops.

[crowd groans]

[screaming]
[giggling]

[crowd gasps]

[Aster continues giggling]

[instrumental spy music playing]

We're writing a profile
on the student we most admire.

Oh, cool, cool.

Views on women in the workplace?
Does Aster like lean meats?


I'm good cop.
Then how come you aren't smiling?

I'll smile when you follow the plan
that I carefully...

I'm surprised more kids
haven't asked to interview me. Huh.

I'm going in.
I'm going in with my smile.

<i>Looks like The Moose have a man open.</i>

<i>Oh!</i>


Not if it's not time to eat.

Now that's weird.

Hey, uh, can I ask you a question?

I don't want to try a taco sausage.

Why Squahamish?

Just, like, your dad seems so unhappy here
and you also seem kind of unhappy.

I gotta go.
No, no, no, wait.

No, you're not taking this seriously.
I have a ton of work I have to do.

No, just, you're so smart.
Like, too smart to, like...

Waste my time trying to win you a girl
who'll never look your way?

No, it just seems weird.
You're weird!

No... Yes.

Enjoy your happy life in Squahamish.
No, no...

The thing about <i>No Exit </i>is it's like how
what I really want is to run my own shop,

with new recipes. And... And FYI,
taco sausage is really effing good.

Okay, but I'm the fourth son

and my family's been making
the same sausage for 49 years

and it doesn't matter
if they're going broke, or out of style,

they're Nana's recipes.

If Ma can't haveÂ Nana,
at least she can make her sausages.

If I break away, it'll break her heart.
And it's either her heart or mine.


So I stay.

[Ellie scoffs]

[sighs heavily]

We had to go
where my dad could get a job.

He studied trains?

Engineering.

PhD, no less.

So, uh,

he became the station manager
at Squahamish.

To start.

The plan was to be promoted
to system engineer.

Or anything engineer.

Squahamish was a jumping-off point.

It turns out speaking good English
trumps having a PhD.

Or one from China anyway.

And my dad, he...

Doesn't speak very good.

He's not bad.
I don't speak very good either.

True.

What's your excuse?

How do you feel about pot roast?

I should get back to the station.

I know, but we've gotta eat.


[engine starts]
[boy] <i>Mom!</i>


Would you like to weigh in or are you
just gonna scream throughout the meal?

I'll deal with the dog wrestling.

Mom!
It's your fault!

[overlapping shouts]


[jaunty instrumental music plays on TV]

[cutlery clinks softly]


Match energy, match strokes,
and just say one thing.

Where were you born?

In Squahamish.

What about you?

Okay. Good. That wasn't so hard.

But where were you born?

I don't need talking practice.

It just seems
like a really short conversation.

[Ellie sighs]

I was born in Xuzhou, China.

When did you come here?

When I was five.

What do you like about Squahamish?
Uh...

I've never been anywhere else.

Me neither.

[Mr. Flores]
<i>How does Satan get his message through?</i>

Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers,
the immoral persons. [groans]

Does he write letters?

No, he causes us to question.
[phone vibrates]

Question our lives, our path.

Our very faith in God.

Satan plants the seed of doubt...
[phone vibrates]

...and, from that seed, grows sin.

Sin is everywhere.

We're lucky to live in a good town
like Squahamish.

But the world is changing.

Let us stay strong against Satan's call,

lest sin creep in and destroy
the good life God has prepared for us.

[school bell rings]

You know what it's like to finally meet
someone your age who gets you?

You know where else you can meet
people your age who get you?

College.



Do pineapple, owl,
caterpillar with glasses.


That doesn't mean anything.

Glasses make the caterpillar look smart.

Favorite food?

Braised pork over rice. Yours?


Does braised pork have five-spice powder?
How do you know five-spice powder?

I kind of creeped in your cabinets.

I'm always looking for new spices.

Giving up on the taco sausage?

Oh, no way. I've been writing to the paper
in Wenatchee for months now.

If I could just get the guy to taste it.

The gateway to greatness is Wenatchee.
Yeah.

Hey, you gotta try it.

What do the other Munskys think?

They haven't tried it.

Taco sausage has a nice ring to it.

Yeah, right?

Hey.

Yeah?

What was your mom like?

Young, funny, dead.

No, before she died.

Young, funny...

fun.

She sounds cool.

Yeah.

I bet she would've tried
the taco sausage.


[chattering indistinctly]

[rain pattering outside]

What do you like about Aster?

She's pretty...

and...

smart...

and she's never mean.

And she smells like fresh-ground flour.

Why?

Just wondering.

What else could I like about her?

I don't know.

[distant thunder rumbles]

How her eyes look right into yours.

How...

she twirls her hair when she's reading.

How...

her laugh...

busts out like she can't help herself
and she stops being so perfect

for just a few moments.

She has at least five different voices.

How you could live
in an ocean of her thoughts and...

feel like she knows,

like really knows...

I'm so stupid.

I just meant...
No, I'm so dumb.

No...
Like a real idiot.

Don't think that I...
No, what you said.

That's what you say when you love someone.

No, I... I was just talking.

I would never, ever actually...
No, it is.

And... And you don't even care.

I mean, I love her and I can't even...

Agh!

[Paul sighs]

You try...

harder than...

anyone I've ever met...

I mean, with the possible exception
of my dad with my mom...

to show a girl that...

you love them.

And if love isn't the effort you put in...

then...

what is it?

Yeah?

Yeah.

Do not! Ugh.

[Paul] It's kinda sweet.
[Ellie] Kinda trite.



Who outruns trains?

That girl's thinking, "Thank God I got out
before wasting my life on that idiot."

She looks sad.

Then she's a moron, too.

[bicycle spokes spinning]

[bike rattles]

practicing for the senior talent show.

A little freaked about it, but whatever.
Okay.

Aster. If she brings up immigration,
you've been talking about the recent...

I know.
When in doubt, if the name is Italian,

probably an artist.

If French, it's probably...
Hey.

<i>â™ª We could do it over and over â™ª</i>

Thanks.
<i>- â™ª And over again â™ª</i>

<i>- </i>Oh.
<i>- â™ª Over and over... â™ª</i>

Uh, sure.

I'm probably gonna crash and burn, but...

thanks for sticking it out with me anyway.

Well...

not like you didn't pay me.
[gentle scoff]

Well, uh...

thanks.

Hey.

You're not gonna crash and burn.

<i>â™ª Believe me... â™ª</i>

[sighs heavily]

You're totally gonna crash and burn.

<i>â™ª And now we're alone... â™ª</i>


[country music plays softly over speakers]

I was wondering...
What about the immigration bill?

Sorry, uh... go ahead.

No, no.

You.

Oh, uh...

The immigration bill.

Mmm?

Uh... right?


Yeah.

Come on, dude.

[country music continues softly
over speakers]

We don't have to talk about...

serious things.

Oh.

Okay.

What were you about to say?

Oh, uh...

It's still cool that we're...

friends.

Yeah. Yeah, it's cool.

Friends.

[music continues over phone speaker]


[phone vibrates]

You messaged me?

Uh, yeah.


[Aster texting]

[phone dings]


[phone dings]


[Aster giggles]
[chuckles]

[Aster texting]



You are...

No.


[Paul over speaker]
<i>I don't want to be just friends.</i>

Wait, what?

No, no. Bad. Sit!

Uh...

Oh.

I think you're pretty and funny

and smart and your laughter, it's like...

an ocean of thoughts.

Like five oceans of thoughts. Like five...

voice...

I like you.

[Gordon Lightfoot's
"If You Could Read My Mind" playing]

I don't... I don't know what to say.

Yeah, me neither.

I'm not a good talker.

That's okay.

[soft chuckle]

[patrons muttering]


<i>â™ª When you reach the part â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Because the ending's

Who rocked their second date?</i>

Number 86, Paul Munsky!
[music plays softly over speakers]

And now, his side-girl's gonna rock
the senior recital.


You're gonna be awesome.
I'm gonna be puking.

You're always playing for an audience.

On the side.

Not on stage, alone.

[Paul] You're gonna crush it.
Hmm.

Oh, did I tell you that some food guy
from the paper in Tukwila wrote me?

He must have heard about me
from the guy in Wenatchee.

He likes how my sausage sounds
and he wants to try it.

Boom! It... It's Munsky time.

Hey, look at you.


So...

what did you and Aster talk about?

Uh, I don't know.

You know, we got milkshakes and fries.

And we held hands.

It was, uh, quiet...

and...

nice.

And then she had curfew,
so we walked back to her car and...

I kissed her.

How...

does that...

happen?

What?

The kiss.

I kissed her.

How do you know she wants to be kissed?

Oh...

She gives you a look.

A look?

Yeah, like, um...

Um...

Okay, she gives you a look and,
when you see the look, you make your move.

Otherwise you look like a real putz.

Hmm.
And now we've got, like, a <i>date </i>date,

not just a friend date, when she gets back
from some youth group in Sacramento.

There are dressing rooms, you know.

I'll just get this.
Really?

Yeah.
No, it's just...


You know, without the jeans
and the flannel shirt...

you look weird.

Gee, thanks.

It just doesn't look like you.

Uh, all girled up.

I know.

Go to the dressing room.
I'll toss you some things.

But you're a dude.

I have a sister.

Go.

[horns playing on, off-key]

Well, our next senior
needs no introduction.

What up, Squahamish! Moose!

[crowd cheering]
Whoo!

You know who I am!

I know who I am!

Let's do this!
[band playing Berlin's "Masquerade"]

[cheering continues]
Whoo!

<i>â™ª The painted faces on the street â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Caricatures of long ago â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, they were young and oh-so sweet â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Down beyond the boulevard â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Knock on doors and empty halls â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª And still sometimes remember â™ª
</i>Oh, my God!

<i>â™ª The masquerade's forever â™ª</i>

[music continues, muted]
[crowd cheering]

Ellie Chu, three minutes till go time.
Last chance to pee.

<i>â™ª They reached for tomorrow â™ª</i>

[crowd sings along]
<i>â™ª But tomorrow's more of the same â™ª</i>


[soft laughter]

[crowd cheering]


Trig! Trig! Trig! Trig!

Trig! Trig! Trig! Trig!
[music stops]

All right, let's give it up next for...

Ellie Chu.


[students laughing]

[plays harmonious minor chords]

[broken string twangs]

[begins song again]

[broken string twangs]

[students snickering]

[overlapping whispers]

Next!


[soft clattering, sliding nearby]


[students whispering]

[plays soft notes]

[playing gentle, harmonious notes]

â™ª <i>Here we are</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Took so long</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Came so far</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I slept</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>To be found</i> â™ª

[song ends]


[applause continues]


When did Ellie Chu get kinda hot?

[frogs croaking, bugs chirring]

Hey.

Hey!

Come on.
Senior recital after-party! Whoo!

[hard rock music playing]
[people chattering]

The Chinese girl came!

[all] Chinese girl!
[girl] Ellie Chu.

I just wanted to tell you
we've had math together all four years

and I always wanted to say
that I like your nails.

Oh.

Yeah. Can't get the bike grease out.

They look badass.

Do you want to play Drinkers of Catan?

Okay. So it's like Settlers,
but just, when you cross a fairway,

you take three shots
and you just keep going.

[boys] Oh!
That's a lot!Â That's a lot!

That's so much!

I will trade you wheat for rye.

Oh, bourbon it is.



I want you to know...

that I can tell
I have been drinking spirits.

Because I have to pee far more often...

than would be indicated by plain punch.

So don't think
I haven't been monitoring the situation.

Cool, cool.
How many cups have you monitored?

Mmm...

Let's get you home.

Okay.

[Paul sighs]


[phone vibrates]

[exhales heavily]
[phone vibrates]


[basement door opens]

but you can leave it in his room.

I thought he'd like.

[phone vibrates]

[approaching footsteps]

[Paul's mother chatters indistinctly]

We went as far asÂ Sekiu once,

but we never made it
all the way to California.

You're quite the little traveler.
I would love to go to California.

[Aster chuckles]
Oh, it's Paul's Chinese friend.

I didn't hear you come in.

I was just, um, dropping off some books.

Aster was just dropping off... Tommy!
[loud whirring upstairs]

Hands off the grinder!

Tommy!

[indistinct shouts upstairs]
[door slams]

Hi.

Hi.

So, uh, you... you and Paul, you guys...

Oh, God, no. No, no, no.
He is, like, totally, 100% into you.

Oh.

You know about us?

He wanted to do some extra reading so...

I lent him some books.

He's doing extra reading?

For you.

That's, uh...

That's sweet.

It is.


I just kept...

talking about books.

I think I almost drove him off.

I can be such a nervous idiot.

You could never be an idiot.

I mean, Paul would never think that
about you, because he's way into you.

I should get back to the station.
No, yeah, no.

Oh, it's just some silly thing I made
on my trip.

I like this stroke off to the side.

Lonely,

but hopeful.

Yeah.

He'll love it.

Hey.

Can I come with?

To the station?

I already lied to my dad
about where I'd be.

I have the day.

[crossing bell dinging]

[train horn blares in distance]

You get to do that every day?

Twice. 6:40 a.m. and 11:40 p.m weekdays.
12:10 p.m. and 9:20 p.m weekends.

Give or take an hour.

That is awesome.

It's a real blast.
No, it's... it's so...

master of the universe.

A teeny-tiny universe. [sighs]

Oh, well. At least you rule something.

Hey, what about those?

My dad doesn't trust them.


Do you want to get outta here?

[Sharon Van Etten's "Seventeen" plays]

<i>â™ª I know what you wanna say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I think that you're all the same â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Constantly being led astray â™ª</i>

Where are we going?

<i>- â™ª You think you know â™ª
</i>To my favorite secret place.

<i>â™ª Something you don't â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Downtown hot spot â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Halfway up the street â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I used to be free â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I used to be 17 â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Follow my shadow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Around your corner â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I used to be 17... â™ª </i>[fading]

Whoa.

Right?

[birds twittering]

Are these deciduous trees?


We don't have trees like this
in Sacramento.

Everything's reversed, so...

things die off in summer,
turn green in winter.

Is that where you grew up?

Born there. Moved here.

My life story.

[water splashes]

Is that long underwear?

Yes.

I almost forgot.

There's no cell service here, so...

[man over radio]
<i>And the Lord said, "Let..."</i>

[rock music playing]

It's like no one can reach us here.

Ellie not here.

Oh, this is for you.

Taylor Swift's yacht saves the day.

[Aster laughs]

[music plays softly on radio]
You know...

I don't think I've ever hung out with
a girl and not talked about boys before.

Oh.

Sorry.
Don't be.

It's nice.

Paul's cool.


He's confusing.

It's like when I'm with him...

I feel...

I feel safe.

He's a sweet guy.

Then it's like he...

writes these things that feel...

not safe.

Not safe?

I overheard Trig
talking to my dad about...

our future wedding.

I mean,
he hasn't even asked me yet, but...

he's just...

so sure.

And maybe that's love.

I should marry Trig.

Oh.

Should I?


Oh, well.

God doesn't know either,
if it's any consolation.

I don't believe in God.

That must be so nice.

No.

It's not.

It's...

lonely.

Yeah.

I wish I knew what I believed.

I keep asking God for a sign.

And then Paul's letter
appeared in my locker.

I've...

never felt so...

[chuckles softly]

...understood.

It's... [scoffs]

It's silly, right?

No.

It's not silly.

You know what is silly?

What are you... No, stop!
[Aster laughs]

Come on!
No. I...

Did you layer?

I am a Russian doll of clothing.
[laughing]

[Chicago's "If You Leave Me Now"
plays softly on radio]

Gravity is matter's response
to loneliness.

Who said that?

<i>â™ª How could we let it slip away? â™ª</i>

I don't know.

<i>â™ª We've come too far â™ª</i>

Then you said it.
<i>- â™ª To leave it all behind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How could we end it all this way? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When tomorrow comes
And we'll both regret... â™ª</i>

My mom loved this song.

She said every song, movie, story...

has a best part.

[soft instrumental bridge playing]

Was that it?

Are you asking or saying?

[instrumental bridge cresting]

<i>â™ª A love like ours â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Is love that's hard to find â™ª</i>
That was it.


<i>â™ª How could we let it slip away? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We've come too far
To leave it all behind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How could we end it all this way? â™ª</i>

Hey.

I hope you find something good
to believe in.

<i>- I'm getting married, Walter.
You can't. You're a newspaper man.</i>

<i>That's why I'm quitting. I want to go
someplace where I can be a woman.</i>

[Walter] <i>You mean be a traitor.</i>
[woman] <i>A traitor to what?</i>

You're a journalist, Hildy.</i>

<i>A journalist? Hell, what does that mean?</i>

[in Mandarin]Â Paul made
a braised pork sausage. Pretty tasty.

Yours is in the microwave.

[TV chatter continues]


[garbage rattling]

[Paul sighs]


[indistinct sports radio chatter]

Hey. [soft chuckle]

Do you believe in God?

Uh... of course.

Yeah.

Yeah, no, of course.

I, uh... I got your painting.

It was... It was pretty.

Thanks.



[strings twang]

[sports radio chatter

Um...

Big game this week.

Uh, training.

I'll, uh...

I'll see you after?

<i>There's an awful lot of confusion

Hey.

All hail the pride of Squahamish.
Thanks.

Uh...

You, uh,
you didn't have to get me a Yakult.

Oh. Yeah, take one.

No, no, I don't, uh, want a Yakult.

Good.

Uh... Nah, I need to talk to you.

Okay. Uh, my hands are full. Could you...

Mmm.

So good.
Uh, hey...

What?

What are you doing?
You don't want me to kiss you?

No!
Why?


[Aster whimpers]

Aster.

Aster, this is not...

We're... We're not...

You...

Paul.
You, um...

Uh... [scoffs softly]

Um...

You like Aster?

[groans, sighs]

[breathes deeply]

It's a sin.

You're going to hell.


Ellie Chu.

[Ellie scoffs]


I know why you're always hanging around.

Popping up everywhere.

Okay,
it was just supposed to be one letter.

I didn't think...
You're in love with me.

Yes, Trig.

I am in love with you.

I get it.

[Mr. Chu] Get away! Go home!

Hey, hey, hey!
This is cashmere fleece, man!

Get out!
All right, all right, all right!

<i>â™ª Did we ever break the rules? â™ª</i>

See you next month.

Paul.

Sir?


mmm...

break up?

No, we weren't, um...

together.

She seems...

sad.

No, you don't, um...

see her.

See?

See what?

Who she is.

Could be.

Her.

[in Mandarin] When Ellie's Ma died...

I fell into a dark hole.

I didn't move for days.

A few days later...

I woke to find Ellie in the booth...

manning the switch.

She looked up at me.

Just 13... an adult already.

And I...

smiled.

[in English]
Have you ever loved someone so much...

you don't want anything about her...

to change?

You're late.
[Pastor Shanley mutters]

I had to grind something.

And to close our Easter services...

our final reading today
will be from Trig Carson.

[low murmurs]

"Love is patient.

Love is kind.

It does not envy.

It does not boast.

It is not proud."

Which is why...

I love...

this little lady.

[low murmurs]

And why she'll make me a fantastic...

wife.

[murmurs continue]

Aster...

will you?

[crowd applauding]

[Ellie] No!
[crowd gasping]

I, um...

Uh, um...

Love isn't...

It isn't...

Thank you, Ellie.

Everyone...
Love isn't pretending.

[crowd gasps]

Uh, I know, um...

because I've been pretending.

Only for a few months, but...

it sucks.


And I've been thinking about how much
it would suck to have topretend to be...

not you...

uh... your whole life.

I always thought
that there was one way to love.

Uh, one right way.

But there are more.

Uh, so many more than I knew.

And...

I never want to be the guy
who stops loving someone...

for loving the way that they want to love.

And thank you, Paul.

That was...

odd.

Now, let's give Trig...

[Ellie] I also have been pretending.
[crowd gasps]

I've been pretending that...

Don't worry, everyone, I, uh...
I think I know where this is going. Um...

Look, Ellie, I am so, so flattered, um...

but, see, you and I are never...
You know, Trig,

I have been writing your papers
for the last four years.

[crowd murmurs]

And if you'll forgive me...

I'm just gonna rewrite you one last time.

Love isn't patient and kind and humble.

Love is...

[stammers nervously]

Love is...

Love is messy.

And horrible and selfish and...

bold.

It's not finding your perfect half.
It's...

the trying...

and...

reaching and...

failing.

Love is...

being willing to ruin
your good painting...

for the chance at a great one.

Is this really the boldest stroke
you can make?

You.

Yeah.

[crowd exclaiming]

[Mr. Flores] Aster!

[door shuts]
Everyone, please, take your seats.

[overlapping chatter]
Everyone, take your seats.

Wait.

So I'm the good painting?

Mommy wants you to know, in case
you are gay, Mommy still loves you.

I'm not gay, Mom.
Thank God.

I might want to change
our sausage recipe, though.

Are you insane?

I love that recipe!
Whatever Dad said!

[overlapping arguments]

Now that is some divine intervention.

[turns on faucet]

[in Mandarin] This is a lot of dumplings.

Six days, 18 meals.

To Grinnell.

We didn't come here
so you could be like me.

We came here
so you could be like your mother.

[in English] You don't mean dead, right?

[in Mandarin] God, I hope not.

[crickets chirring]

[train horn blares in distance]



Yeah?

Yeah.

You need four portfolio pieces
for art school, so...

Art school?

That's great.

Yeah, well, nothing's great yet,

but we'll see.

What's going on with you?

Well...

I'm headed east to Grinnell.

I'm leaving tomorrow...
That's great, Ellie. Take care.

Aster!

I'm sorry.

It was just...

supposed to be one letter.

I never meant to hurt you.

Deep down, I probably knew the truth.

You really didn't use enough emojis
in his texts.

I don't know what they mean.

A puppy or...

a sausage...
I should have sent you a sausage emoji?

Fair point.

For what it's worth...

it's not like the thought
never crossed my mind.

You know...

if things were different.

Or I was different.

You could never be different.

"Am I sure I'm different?

How do I know I'm sure?"
Hey, I can be sure.

"I mean, what does God think?"


And on, and on, and on, and on.
And you know, you... you watch.

Okay? In a couple of years,
I am gonna be so sure.

Good luck with that.

[chuckles softly]

Find something good in Iowa
to believe in, heathen.

I'll see you in a couple years.

Yeah, Munsky Sausages is gonna blow up.

I might get to Iowa before you do.

I'd better get going then.
