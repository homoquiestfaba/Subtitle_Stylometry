No.

Dad, when can we

He loves that stuff.

Yeah, you guys

<i>So, I'd sent my manuscript

Uh, Neptune.
It's<i> Neptune's Oblivion.</i>

Though an interesting title
and thoroughly written,

we're not accepting manuscripts

Oh. Well, I could
cut it down a bit.

You could cut it in half and
there'd still be too many words.

Ah, Well, I know
it doesn't feel like it ends,

but that's because it all pays off in
the sequel, which I'm writing right now.

Oh, Lord, not more.

This isn't a subject

No.

This has been
my entire life this past year.

Good day, Mr. Parker.

We got you. Christmas!

Ralph?

It's almost 10:00.
Are you awake?

Uh-uh.
Mm.

[smacks lips, breathes deeply]

So, is this the list?

You know, the one you
woke me up about at 3:00 am?

Yeah.

That's my Christmas plan.

Okay. All right.

Well, you know,
some of these are good.

Yeah, sledding. That's great.

Maybe you and Mark
could do that.

You know, father-son outing.
Okay. Great.

But some of these are...

wax throwing?

Axe. Axe throwing.

With the tomahawks and stuff.
Okay. Even better.

Uh, "Make them catch and kill
their own turkey." Ooh. [chuckles]

Well, maybe we could combine
that with the axe throwing.

Could be fun
for the kids, I think.

Yeah, some of these

Why don't we just
keep it simple?

Like, we could go ice skating.
You know I would love that.

Oh, I know.

And, you know, maybe we just do
the usual Christmas stuff.

Really?
Yeah.

We probably should've trimmed
the tree before we brought it inside.

No, that's just a saying.

Nobody trims trees.

Besides, it's perfect.

[grunts, sighs]

Yeah. Kinda looks like
it's going through puberty.

No wonder they gave it

Now in.

Go in and up.
Why didn't you just point there?

[Ralphie] Looks good.
Yeah.

Keep it up, guys.
How come you're not helping?

We're having fun watching you.
Yeah.

When it's just us, it kind
of feels like child labor.


Oh, no, honey, it's not labor

Yeah.

Well, I can't reach that height!

Yeah, Mark, hold the ladder.

Just get up a little higher.
It looks really good.

What next?

We have the whole side

the one that faces the window.
Mm-hm.


Grandma! Are you sleeping?

No, just resting my eyes.

It was more fun with all of us.

Yeah. Grandpa always helped us
finish the tree.

You know what? You're right.
Yep.

All right. Here we come. Come on.
Okay.

[Ralphie] The tree topper!
It's not an angel.

We always have an angel.

Uh-oh!

Kids, come over here

Wait. Huh?


Building new traditions.

It's good.
Okay.

No doubt about it.

Around these parts...

[Ralphie] <i>Come on, take the bait.</i>
Mm.

<i>That's it.</i>

Okay.

<i>Hook, line and sinker.</i>

[all cheering]

[Sandy] Ralph, we're leaving in 15.
Okay.

[Sandy] How's it going up here?
Oh. Couldn't be better.

Look at this.

These obituaries
are so impersonal.

Well, make it un-impersonal.

This will be the last time most
folks ever give him a thought.

It's a lot of pressure.

Yeah.

If anyone can do it, it's you.

I gotta finish getting ready.
All right. I'll be down in a few.

Okay.

We're out.
Ah, you gotta be kidding.

All right. Well, get comfortable.
It's gonna be a while.

Gotta let it cool on its own.


Mom, can we play in the snow?

Yeah. Why not?

Bring your gloves.

[Ralphie imitating Mrs. Parker]
"No, honey, get the Plymouth."

Stinkin'...

[grunts, laughs]

That's not how you do it.

You gotta pack it tighter
if you want it to go further.

Here, let me show you.

You gotta pack it up.

Come on, you guys have
made snowballs before. Here.

If you want it to go far,
you gotta pack it. Pack it.

Push it. See, the tighter you
pack it, the further it will go.

Like this. Then it goes...

Good luck.

Like that?

Come on.

Mm.

I'm feeling no pain.
Well, whose side are you on?

Uh... me and Mark.

And you and Julie.

Stop. Take cover.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Now!

Wait for me. Oh! [grunts]

Oh, yeah.

That's a good idea.


No, no, no.
Head for cover! Run!

Want to bet?

Yes, we can!
No, you can't!


Get 'em, Dad!

Dad, you ran three stop signs.
Thank you, Mark.

He is your dad.

Everyone out, please.

No, Mom. We're at the hospital.

[Mrs. Parker] Oh, honey.

Come on, let's get you home.

I'll put some Bactine on it.

I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

No, it's okay, honey.

Because the doctor said it's just
gonna be a couple of days, tops.

Yeah. Better to be safe.

We don't want anything
to get in that eye.

Like a snowball?
[Ralphie grunts]

Okay. Let's get you home. Okay?

We'll get you safe.
Um, Ralph...

<i>that every dollar we had set
aside for Christmas was spent!</i>

<i>And now, just three days

That hurt?
No.

[dog barking]

<i>an impossible situation,</i>

<i>I did what any good parent
would do in a time like this.</i>

<i>Completely ignore the problem
and hope it goes away on its own.</i>

<i>Hey, Reuben. It's Ralph Parker.</i>

I just wanted to call
and let you know

that I'm close to completing
my follow-up manuscript.

I can probably have it
wrapped up in a few days.

So if you think it'll
make a difference...

haven't heard back on the one.</i>

Nothing yet, huh?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

Okay. Uh...

Do you know if they received
the fruit basket I sent?

I know. I know.
I'm getting to that.

Ralph, I know you'll write
a great obituary.

But right now,
we need to focus on Christmas.

Yeah, I know.
I'd love nothing more.

But I'm just a little hung up on the monsters
that stole presents from our children.

I had everything. I had
everything. Every gift.

You were a sight
to behold at Higbee's.

I was. I really was.

But then, you know, we get into
a snowball fight, we're having fun,

and then Mark says, "Hey, I
bet you can't hit me from here!"

And then she just came out of nowhere.
Ralph...

I mean, I didn't see her. She just sort of teleported.
Ralph.

Honey, everyone knows that you
did not try to bean our daughter.


This is, you know...

My dad made this all
look so easy.

Yeah, that's what
good parents do.

But that doesn't mean
it was easy.

So, look, I put together
all our cash

and what we have left
of the Christmas fund

and we can still
get the kids some presents.

How much do we have?

Including the change
from the ashtray...

$21.17.

<i>It was worse than I thought.</i>

<i>Things had sunk to a new low,</i>

<i>forcing us to attempt the most
delicate of parental maneuvers...</i>

<i>the lowering of expectations.</i>

[Julie] It's crazy.
Hey, kids.

So, this Christmas, we
thought it might be really fun

to focus a little more
on gratitude.

Yeah.

Wait, what's going on?


Well, that's what
we wanted to talk about.

Um, because Christmas isn't really
about how many great gifts you get.

Oh, no.
Isn't it?

[Ralphie] <i>They're onto us.</i>
No. It isn't, Mark.

Because this is part of Christmas,
right? And maybe the best part.

Mm-hm.

Yeah, all of us together,
enjoying delicious home-cooked...

food.

[flies buzzing]


Are you saying we're not getting
presents, just more casserole?


What your mom
is trying to help me say

is that there will be presents.
Mm-hm.

Yeah.
Just more likely not the ones you wanted.

Does this mean
Santa's not coming?

bail out! Eject, eject!</i>

No, no. Of course he's coming.

comes. [Sandy] Yeah. Yeah.

No, we just want you to keep
one thing in mind.

<i>Don't say it.</i>

It's the thought that counts.


<i>Kids can smell that stinker
from a mile away.</i>

So, Christmas is gonna suck?

I knew it! This means I'm
not getting a sled, doesn't it?

Okay, less attitude
and more gratitude, mister.

[door closes]

got the message.

Can you just go after Mark?

Sorry.

Wanna play Spades?

One-Eyed Jacks?

No, thanks, Grandma.

I have something important
I need to figure out.

Mark, let's go for a walk.

Come on.

Whoa! Did I hear
"on the house"?

No, you didn't.
[sighs]

Hey, how's your
Christmas going, kid?

It's okay, I guess.

I'm trying to focus on gratitude.
[confused grunts]

That's real low, Ralph.

Hey, Mark,

I'm ten.
Old enough. Come on back here.

Have some fun. Come on.

Any in here?

Nope. Nothing.

Hey. Come with me.


What do you want?

I'm fixin' to feed the lobster.

I found your puppy.

She must have

What's your angle?

If you want your adorable

There you go.

No way.

Yup.

You got it.
Just go right down there.

Well done, kid.

There you go.
Wow.

pork rinds. Put it on my tab.

No, out of pork rinds.

Jeez. What kind of bar
runs out of pork rinds?

Hey, you know, last week
they were out of corn nuts.

Wow.

[bully laughing]

Kids, you know, when
your father was your age,

he had a similar
sort of problem,

but he worked it out.

<i>Uh, the Scut Farkus Affair.</i>

Really? What happened?

Well, he beat the snot
out of that kid. [laughs]

That's what happened.

Wow!
Daddy beat someone up?

Wait, that story is true?

Is it so hard to believe?

Huh. Ralph.

Did he ever bother you again?
Nope.

Hey, you guys gotta
get this figured out.

You can't just
be a target for 'em.

Armoire.

That's not a word.
Yes, it is.

It's just a fancy
word for "cabinet."

You have one upstairs.
I certainly do not.

In Indiana, we say "wardrobe."

Come on, grab your coat.
What for?

I have an idea.

"Arm." For five.

Oh, boy!

Five whole points for Sandy.

Good for you.

It's hideous.

The worst.

<i>All my hopes were pinned
on one last publisher.</i>

<i>- Hello, it's Reuben.</i>
Hey, Reuben. It's Ralph again.

<i>- Ralph.</i>
Uh...

Wow. Still in the office
on Christmas Eve?

That's dedication.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

Um, I was just calling
to check in, um,

one last time, before Christmas.

<i>No. Ralph.
Um, not interested in it.</i>

I see.

<i>That was it. I had my chance.</i>

<i>And now... I had my answer.</i>

[dogs barking distantly]

Ralphie, are you all right?

Yes.

No. No.

That obituary is the hardest
damn thing I have ever had to write.

And I just found out why.

I'm no writer.

Just ask any publisher
in Chicago.

Nobody cares, Mom.

Nobody wants my book.
It's over.

Oh, Ralphie.
And an obituary?

How do you sum up a man's life
into a paragraph?

I can't do it.

Ralphie.

Ralphie, look at me.

Just forget about the
publishers and the paragraphs.

Forget about trying to write
the perfect words.

Life isn't perfect.

[shuddering breaths]

Your father certainly
wasn't perfect.

Just write about
the man you love.

Or don't.

It's up to you.

[the old man]
<i>He looks like a pink nightmare.</i>

<i>This is a lamp!</i>

<i>I had one when
I was eight years old.</i>

<i>Incredibly, the dam had broken.</i>

<i>My fingers raced to keep up

Yeah, fellas.

Oh, no, honey. It's okay. We

No! You said Santa won't

Did I say that?
[all] Yes!

Well, I didn't know
this was gonna happen.

I knew it. No Christmas.

Okay. You know what?

I'm gonna go out,

Ralphie, it's Christmas Eve.

Well, then I better hurry.
Well, uh... Everything's closed!

Well, you heard her.
Where are you going?

I am fixing this.

Ralph! Just give it up.

No! I am not giving it up.

Oh. And we're gonna

Put your hands up.
I said put 'em up.

It's okay.
I know the owner, Flick.

I just had to borrow
a Christmas star.

I left a note.

Well, that's a new one.

Wait.

Don't I know you?

Scut Farkus.

<i>- There he was, with those same yellow eyes.</i>
[evil laugh]

<i>Dear God,
he still had yellow eyes!</i>

<i>I hadn't said as much

Who's there?
You got visitors.

[door buzzes]


Sandy.

Wow, you look great.

I feel great, Ralph.

Better than ever.

Mark?

[in British accent]
Hello, Dad.

Why are you talking like that?

Oh, look. He suddenly cares.
[chuckles]

You never came home, Dad.
So things went a wee bit rotten.

Julie, is that you?


Brought you a present.
What happened to your eye?


Well, you did keep
one promise, Ralph.

It was a Christmas
we'll never forget.


Never forget.
[grunting]

Never forget. Never forget.
[gasps]

Never forget.
[laughs]

Never forget.

Never forget.

Ah, man.


That's the police station.
I think we just passed it.

Don't worry about it.

<i>I was very worried.</i>

<i>Oh, forget jail.</i>

<i>Scut was gonna kill me!</i>

You're looking kinda
jumpy, Parker.

Me? No. I'm fine.

Like busting into a bar
on a Christmas Eve fine?

Oh, I didn't want to do that.

I had to. I needed
that star for the tree

for my family for Christmas.

None of it makes any sense.

When we were kids,
life was simple.

It was all just fun and games.
Am I right?

Lots of laughs. [fake laugh]

Yeah, now I got some
devil spawn of my own,

running around all day
on that stupid snowmobile.

Between us... I think
they're worse than I ever was.

No. What are you talking about?

I mean, you...

You were great.

<i>Oh, no! This was it!</i>

<i>Kiss my sweet ass...</i>

This is home, right?

[dog barking]

Yeah, this is home.

Breaking into Flick's dump, huh?

You must've really
needed that star.

Yeah, I did.

Look, I appreciate you blowing
smoke up my dress like you did,

but we both know
when we were kids...

I was kind of a nightmare.


I was just trying
to be a tough guy, you know?

Like my old man.

But that day you handed my ass
to me... I mean, that got me thinkin'.

<i>Not sure where this is going.</i>

You know, I put all
that garbage behind me.

And look at me now.

I'm one of the good guys.

So I guess what I'm saying is...

I owe you, Parker.

Hey.

Merry Christmas, Ralph.

Merry Christmas, Scut.

You know, if anyone else but me
had answered that call,

you'd be rotting
in a jail cell all weekend.

How about that?


[siren wails]


[Mrs. Parker] Oh, Ralphie.
You found a star.

Yeah.

I miss him, Ma.

[Mrs. Parker] I miss him, too.

But I know he's here.

[Ralphie groans]
[Mrs. Parker sighs]

[Ralphie] I'll get the fuse.
No. No. You go to bed.

I've gotta learn to do these
things on my own from now on.

I'll be fine.
Okay.

Okay, so, go. Go on.

I'm going up.
Okay. All right.

Be careful, Ma.

Good night, Ralphie.

Good night.

[footsteps running]



Come on, it's Christmas!
There's presents under the tree!

We have to go see! Come on!

Okay, we're up, we're up.
Okay, okay.

Hurry up!
Faster!


you did it!

You got the star and Santa came!
[Mark] Look at it!

Is that a beer logo?
[Mark] Awesome.

Don't ask.

[laughs] Oh. Merry Christmas.
[Sandy] Oh. Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas, Ma.
[Mark] He ate the cookies!

Good morning.
[Julie] And the stockings are full!

[both] Wow.
Did you get extra presents?

No. Did you?

No.

"For Ralph. Love, Dad."

Oh.

"For Julie. Love, Grandpa."


Mom, these are all from Dad.

Yeah.

Last night, when I was
down in the basement

fixing the fuse, I found them.

He must've got them before.

Yeah. [chuckles] He did good.


[laughs] Well, come on! Let's open gifts!
[Ralphie] Yeah!

opened the gifts from my old man,</i>

<i>marveling at their
thoughtful perfection.</i>

An Easy-Bake Oven!

I can make Christmas cookies today!
[Ralphie] Yeah!

It even has a pom-pom.

[Ralphie] Wow.
Really pretty.

It is soft.
Yeah.

[Sandy] Ah...

Oh, lovely.
Wow.

Wow!

I'm admitting this,</i>

And, Dad, I have something for you.
Oh.


Ooh.
The gifts are great.

Thanks.
You're welcome.

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

[Mrs. Parker] Oh.

[laughing]
[Sandy] What?

Oh. A radiator.

Where did you...
I blackmailed Delbert.

It was easy.
[chuckles] That's my girl.

Thank you, sweetheart.

I love it.

[Ralphie]<i> Delbert Bumpus. The gift that keeps on giving.</i>
Oh, my God.

I can't wait.

Me neither.

[Mrs. Parker] Not until
the casseroles are finished.


Two plates, two forks.

Off you go.
You serious?

I'm serious.
Out you go. Come on.

Put some meat
on those bones. Go on.

[Julie] It never ends.
I know, I know.

[Sandy sighs]

You know, I've been thinking.

I mean, a year, it really
isn't that much time.

No, honey.

I'm going back to work.

Okay.

Great job!

Okay.


The wife and I loved your story.

The newspaper.

It's great!

It's my story.

How did they get my story?

Don't look at me.

I gave it to 'em.

What are you talking about?

Well, last night, after you
stormed out, the newspaper called.

They wanted the obituary
for the Sunday paper.

So, I borrowed your mom's car
and I dropped it off.

It's not an obituary.

No, I know.
The editor said the same thing.

Ralph, I read it. It's the
best thing you've ever written.

And besides,
I wasn't about to give them

the lousy three sentences
you scribbled on that notepad.

[phone ringing]
Oh, I'll get it.

Hello? Yes.

Yes, he's here.

It's for you.

Who is it?

It's the editor from the paper.

Hello?

Uh-huh.

Yes.

Yes, I do. All right.

Okay. Mm-hm.

Thank you.

Well, what did he say?

He wants to know
if I have more stories.

Ralph...

You did it.

I did it. I did it!

[all laughing]
I did it.

<i>I did. I actually did it!</i>

<i>I was a bona fide
published writer!</i>

<i>And they wanted more!</i>

[indistinct chatter]
[knocking on door]

I'll get it!
He also said it's gonna be syndicated.

What?
What does that mean?

It means it's going
in all the papers.

Even in Chicago?
Yeah.

Come on. Let's go read it!

Ralph.
[Julie] Wait for me!

Thank you, honey.
Of course.

[Mrs. Parker] Ralphie, you have visitors.
Go, go, go!

Okay. Okay.
Go!

Who is it, Ma?

There he is!
Hohman's own Ray Bradbury!

Oh, man! Good job.

Hey! Yeah, good stuff, man.
Thanks, buddy.

Mom loved it.

Had me read it to her twice.
Wow.

Thanks for the story, Ralph.
Hey, Larry.

Great excuse to get
out of the house.

Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

How do you feel about casserole?

I love it.
You must be hungry.

Casserole.

Hey, why don't you go check out

I picked up some gifts

Sandy!

Hey.
Hey. Merry Christmas.

I wanted!

Oh.

Cool! A saber.

Awesome!
Oh.

[Mrs. Parker] No, no, no.

Let's go. Go.

Come on. We need some dishes.
