[instrumental music]

You're late tonight, sir.

In all the years of coming here

I've never told you my name.

It's Walter.

It'd make me so happy
if you called me that.

Walter.

Ignacio.

Good evening.

The allure of that never
fades I'm happy to report.

Couple of bunches of hydrangeas?

You got it.

[music continues]

[indistinct chattering]

[music continues]

[music continues]

[indistinct chattering]

[music continues]

Goodnight, Walter.

Goodnight, Ignacio.

[intercom buzzing]

You've got to be kidding me.

Just ignore it.
That is not in my nature.

[intercom buzzing]

Yes?
<i>Help me!</i>

Sam?
<i>No. It might be a trick.</i>

Who is this? What's happening?

<i>Help me!</i>
I'm buzzing you in.

Get down there, I'm gonna call 911.

Not a chance.
Then I'm going.

Okay, okay, okay, alright, fine.

What is that?

Oh, hell.

Oh.

[indistinct mumbling]

Senseless.

Perfectly senseless...

My wife...

Call 911!
I already did. Jesus.

It's okay, the ambulance is on its way.

Just hang in there.

Make sure she gets this.
Jesus!


Her name is Marcia.

There is another guy out here!

Don't let go.

<i>I'm here.</i>

I was just...

[no audio]

[instrumental music]

[siren wailing]

[indistinct police radio chatter]

<i>A thinker who predates
Darwin and dares suggest</i>

<i>that an objective
analysis of what it is</i>

<i>to live as a human.</i>

A thinking sentient being

whose sole trajectory is toward the grave.

Particularly once children have been reared

would have us perhaps
choose not to be born at all.

Imagine that.

<i>Better not to live than
to live and suffer.</i>

But Eros seduces us not only into striving

for the falsely ethereal,
but worse, propagating

<i>and thereby subjecting
another generation</i>

<i>to the same suffering we endure.</i>

In short, to love and reproduce

is at some level a sinister enterprise

because we deposit offspring
into such a shitty world.

Anyway you look at it, grim stuff.

<i>So...</i>

...Friday then.

[indistinct chattering]

Just 10 years ago I was
certain the answer was no.

The Greeks had it right.

We're just atoms.

But who knows?

In your lifetime, not mine, thank goodness

we'll perhaps become immortal.

You believe in that stuff?

Our thoughts anyway. Measurable in bits.

Everything reducible to 2
symbols or their absence.

I used to believe in nothing.

Now I believe in everything.

My problem is how all of
this degrades our appetite

to keep asking what it could all mean.

Jill might have cancer.
Might?

A lesion on one of her ovaries.

Ah.

Does your mother know?
<i>We're not telling her yet.</i>

This puts me in a very odd...

Dad, is that really gonna be your response?

<i>Of course not, Adam.</i>

What can we do?

She doesn't want me telling anyone, so...

...this conversation is...

It's nothing personal, she
just doesn't want people.

No need to explain.

I just...

I'm here, Adam.

Always.

[instrumental music]

[indistinct chattering]

Oh!

[indistinct chattering]

<i>I told her, but she's like "You
promised me," so I'm hosed.</i>

What... what if I need that?

What?
The chair.

Oh, sorry. Um, hold on a second.

Dude, how many tickets do you have?

<i>Fuck you. No way.</i>

Excuse me...
<i>Hold on.</i>

I said hold on.

Can I just have this chair

until whoever you're waiting for gets here?

I didn't say that I was waiting for anyone.

Okay, I get it.

Um, excuse me, may I
please have this chair?

Why didn't you just ask in the first place?

<i>Dude, just buy the
ticket and I'll deal.</i>

No. I don't wanna pay for 2.

I need this chair and you clearly don't.

Who are you to determine what I need?

Alright, you keep your fucking chair.

<i>It's the only empty seat in here</i>

but you could stare at it while
you're killing fucking trees.

My book is used.
<i>Yeah?</i>

Well you're a selfish, lonely bitch.


[indistinct chattering]


[instrumental music]


[indistinct chattering]

The thing about Bobby is
he's an auditory learner

more than a visual one.

Come on, Marta.

You're really gonna choose now

<i>to talk about your
precious little Bobby.</i>

There's a line!

[music continues]


<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

Did you honk at me, Sarah?

I did, Marta.
<i>Un-fucking believable.</i>

And what if I needed to speak to Joan?

Uh, you could e-mail her.

Maybe I need to speak with her in person

because my son is having trouble.

Hire a tutor like the rest of us.

How do I know what to say to the tutor

<i>if I can't speak to his teacher?</i>

Which brings us back to e-mail.

I learn more in person.

Inflections.

Like I'm learning what a
shrew you are right now.

Shrew?

I wouldn't get the full
effect in written text.

Did you just say shrew?

[car horn blares]

Fuck off, Jane!

<i>Marta...</i>

...why don't you e-mail me?

Imagine that.

You're a cunt, Sarah.

Honk at me again and I'll deck you.

Just get me to 5 o'clock.

[instrumental music]

Hi, mommy.

Hey!
Here you go, Angie.

Did you do the math yet?

No, I'll just ask Hal.

Because he's a fucking genius!

Hal, I can't figure out this...

Jesus!
Get the fuck out!

Lock your door!
I said get out!

This is why we have locks!

[jazz music]

Really?
Are you seriously still here?

Help me with this problem, sicko.
<i>Call one of your...</i>

I did. None of them have done it.

None of them has done it.
Eat me.

Incest is taboo. Give me.

Not with your jizz hands.

"Find the ratio of radius
to circumference..."

It should never deviate.
It's Pi r to Pi r squared.

Oh, right.

That's so easy.

Have you and Amy ever...

I mean, have you guys...
I wish.

There's always holocaust literature.

Fuck you. I wasn't even...

Wailing away reading about the six million?

We will pursue this no further.

What about you?

I would have with Lucas, but he never tried

and I don't wanna come off like a slut.

Idiot.

Me or Lucas?
Both.

You think I should have
lost it to that douche bag?

He is a douche bag.

Thanks for telling me.

I hate all the guys who wanna fuck you.

I just said he didn't wanna fuck me.

Did you blow him?
Has Amy blown you?

I asked you first.
Yes.

[chuckles]
You had Lucas Rapp's tool in your mouth?

Okay, enough.

And he never tried to fuck you.

Never.
So he's gay.

Maybe.

Has Amy ever...
Handjob.

Were you thinking about Anne Frank?

[chuckles]
Watching footage of "The Long March."

What?

How do you know this shit?

You're a fucking freak.


Imagine if all the people
who built these brownstones

could see the city now.

Mm...

It's our ruin or our nirvana.

What's that supposed to mean?

Either we'll extinguish
ourselves... or become God.

Jesus, Hal.

What else is there?


[instrumental music]

You can still write.

<i>Shit don't go away.</i>

Just don't nobody wanna read it.

<i>Monica know you're down here?</i>

We broke up over a year ago.

Mission on your own then?

Maybe.
<i>Fuck that supposed to mean?</i>

Bringin' your obliquity up in here?

This ain't no motherfucking courtroom.

Just finish up.

Look at that.

<i>Boy in the day...</i>

...girl at night...


Nothin' better.

I have a friend outside
that's going to join us.

Friend? What kind of friend?

Helps out with this sort of thing.

Sort of thing?

I'm going to open the door.

Hello there.

What's going on, Jeffrey?

Jeffrey has asked me to
help to get you some help.

You a fuckin' narc?

I spoke to Dr. Barnes.

Who told my man about Dr. Barnes?

Your father.

Fuck you, man.

Hey Joe, Joe, where you going, huh?

Hey, hey, hey, hey!
No! Fuck you, Jeffrey!

<i>Fuck you, fuckin' narc
ass, mother fucker!</i>

Here's what happens in the next hour!

We pack you up, go to your
doctor, and him and you talk.

Well, you have to have an
appointment to see that motherfucker!

And what he say to do, you gonna do.

I'll do as I please.
I done took away that right.

Man, I'm gonna see the
police, I'm gonna tell 'em...

I'm gonna tell 'em you kidnapping me.

I know every police in this precinct.

Get you locked up on possession,
take days to even think about

remembering to give you a phone call.

So what you gonna do, do the jail route

or the doctor route?

<i>I needed to tell someone.</i>

By all means.

Look, the last thing I
wanted was for you to...

Then... then why do you do specifically

what I asked you not to do?

Because I am scared and
bewildered and confused.

What do you think I am?

If he says it's...
Then we tell them.

How?

When? What does one even...

This is what I am talking about.

Why I wanted to speak to
someone who's been a parent.

My parent who knows our kids.

Mrs. Zarrow?

Is this at all related to the fertility?

<i>Adam asked the same question.</i>

There are some studies that
suggest a connection between

progesterone and ovarian cancer

<i>but a large majority
that makes none.</i>

The truth of the matter is we... we
won't know for a couple of decades

given the uptick in the use of those drugs.

It will have been worth it.
Let's not go there.

<i>I'm gonna have to agree
with your husband.</i>

Dr. Nachtigal will
assist. He's extraordinary.

And it's...

<i>Friday.</i>
Friday.

The earliest I could get.

[train chugging]

Uh, Jill, Adam?
Hi, Ray.

You guys have a couple of minutes?

We're leaking on you again?

No. And I got your check.

I'm gonna go up if that's okay.
Yeah.

<i>Thi... this will just take a
couple of minutes, I promise.</i>

Really, Ray, it's not a good time.

It's about your kids.

What's of course hypocritical
is we're all alike.

How's that?

Over-educated, irrepressibly ambitious.

Moved out to the suburbs,
thought it would be perfect

but without the bank or
the law firm or whatever

what's left, but to polish our children

and obsess over every little offense.

More?

I think I'll switch to wine.

Stems are in the left cabinet.

You know her math challenged son

already says he's going to mommy's college?

<i>What college?</i>
Princeton.

Of course.

It's utterly heinous,
the level of entitlement.

As if I would already
know that Allie and Angie

were going to Dartmouth.

[both chuckling]

<i>This is good.</i>

I'll send you the website.

From all over the world right to your door.

The shipping fees are less
than what the taxes would be.

What I will say is next to no caregivers

all moms... but still

I thought by leaving Manhattan
I was through with it.

This is worse because all
of the conniving and ambition

are less artfully concealed.

Don't lose sight of how lucky you are.

[telephone ringing]
Morning on the other side of the world!

That will be husband.
I'll check on the girls.

Thanks, Mere.

Hello!
<i>Angie?</i>

Oh, you know, just keeping it all moving.

About to have dinner.

Meredith came out.

I know.

How's China?


Well, what do you want me to ask you?

I know.

Allie is sick, but it will pass.

When are you coming back?

No, no, everything is fine. I'm just...

You do want to come home though.

Promise?

No, I know, sure.

Girls, it's your dad!

<i>May I call you once I put them down?</i>

Okay, I-I'll try anyway.

Here.

Hi, daddy.

<i>Immediately.</i>

Mm.

[indistinct chattering]

Hello there.

I beg your pardon.

Can't a man greet a woman in the street?

Is it Friday?

Just mixing things up.

You were going to call.

Did you have lunch with Adam?

What did he want?
To catch up.

Where were you headed?

I'm craving chocolate.

Mind if I join?

You lecture today?

Schopenhauer's take on erotic striving.

By my age, he was living with poodles.

He said, "Marriage was to
reach into a sack of snakes

and find an eel."


Mine is a life in which
the thinkers I admire

contradict the reality I inhabit.

Well, that's a relief.

I'm gonna retire.

What?

At the end of the year.

My spring-load is light, then I'm done.

And you're telling me this
on a chance walk to the deli?

When else?
Why?

I always said when I was done I'd know it.

I've been suspicious for some time.

<i>Suspicion is hardly...</i>
I'm certain.

What are you gonna do?

Wake up and not have any idea.

I've got a decade left, maybe 2.

<i>I want possibility.</i>

It's all you've ever done.

And my life has been incredibly fulfilling.

I've been decent, honest, loyal.

I've worked hard.
Yes.

I've also been perpetually
and resolutely safe.

It's a threshold, Marcia.

There for a moment, then gone.

I've spent my life delving
into what it all means.

I wanna see for myself

without the reassurance of young adoration.

And will it be alright
if I still adore you?

More essential than ever.

Let's get you chocolate.

I really think we should give it an hour.

A half hour even.
Not happening.

Just to put it in perspective.

Particularly with the
sort of week it's been.

Hal! Ella!

Get your asses down here.

If you're gonna interrogate us like this

which based on the stories
you and dad have told us

will be patently hypocritical...

I swear to you, Hal, if you don't cut

the lawyerly bullshit, I
am gonna smack you so hard

you're gonna come to in New Jersey.

Jill...

Answer the question.

Once a week? More?

<i>Three times? Every day?</i>

Again, I'm sorry, I reject
the inquisitional tone.

Hal, if you ever wanted to do me a favor

just play ball here.

What the hell is going on?

You've been getting
baked daily it would seem

in full view of our neighbors.

But why the rage and hysteria?

Why do you cry every
day for the last 3 weeks?

Ella, please.
Seriously, you guys must have...

Oh, my God, it's all crashing down.

Guys, answer the question.

Fine. At least daily.

Even more than that. Whenever possible.

<i>Where do you get it?</i>
Mm-mm.

You're telling us, Hal.

Not unless you want me changing schools.

A kid in your class?

Yeah, would you rather
I buy it on the streets?

Would that make you feel better?

It's pot, dad.

Ultimately less potent
than the 4 glasses of wine

you drink every night.

And I'm first in my class by miles

what the fuck difference does it make?

Don't disrespect your father.

Did you seriously just say disrespect?

What is going on here?

Anyone?

<i>Go ahead.</i>

A tumor has been discovered on
one of your mother's ovaries.

Oh, shit.

<i>She is having a
procedure this Friday.</i>

<i>They'll have her in the
hospital for the night</i>

and in bed for a lot of the weekend.

So I think you can understand
why the timing of this...

So, um, I'm sorry, as
in, uh, as in malignant?

Jesus, Hal!

<i>Possibly, yes.</i>

It's largely now, it's just a
question of whether it's spread.

Look, guys, whatever
happens, we're gonna deal.


I know.

Just stop smoking pot
on the roof or anywhere.

We will.

You promise?

I promise.

[Ella sniffles]

You know this motherfucker
think I'm crazy, right?

Crazy is a tricky word, Joe.

You hear this shit?

Been dealing with that since grade school.

Motherfucker twists every word
that comes out of your mouth.

Okay, Shani.

Oh, fine-looking woman that Shani.

<i>That's enough, Joe.</i>
Fine habiliments too.

I said that's enough, Joe.

Oh, Shani don't mind being told she fine.

Got 'em kind of legs that don't stop.

Goodbye, Dr. Barnes.

Which one of you is Jeffrey?
I am.

I told you explicitly...
I know. I know.

First of all, I would like
you to meet Cedar Lemons.

And we truly appreciate you seeing us

after what I know must
have been an arduous day.

You lay that shit on, Jeffrey.

<i>That woman was a patient.
I'm running a practice here.</i>

We're truly sorry.

And there's no point to any of this

unless Joe is on board.

Joe is on board.

I need to hear that from Joe.

On board, doctor.

<i>I've heard that before.</i>

Uh, just got to make things right.

Get my equilibrium.
<i>Not in here, Joe.</i>

Oh, come on, doctor.
Joe, listen to me.

Not in here.

There's a bathroom down the hall.

Where you goin', bitch?

Wherever you go. Like wine on rice.

And you don't disrespect me

or Jeffrey or the doctor here, no more.

Shit's done. You got that?

Got it.

So he wants to shoot up and you allow that?

I run a psychiatric office, not a precinct.

How do you know Joe?

We grew up together.

You're paying for the muscle?

His father.
I met him.

Difficult man, but obviously smart.

Joe's smarter.

Would be tough to argue
that right at this moment.

You don't seem to like Joe much.

I love Joe.

I spent 4 years confronting
the tragedy that is Joe. Smart?

Imagine what he could have been.

We get him across the
street, I can keep him in

until he signs himself
out, which he will do.

You're gonna be there to pick him up?

I'm leaving for Delaware.


He'll be out of his mind with no money.

He has a history of theft.

<i>I know.</i>
And violence.

I'm not gonna follow him around
and clearly you're not either.

I need to do this.

Not just across the street.

Inside. Where he signs his name.

Just a second.

Just a second.

Joe.
Well, fuck you, man.

I'm just makin' sure I've
got everything I need.

My wife and my children
are expecting me at home.

I ain't stoppin' you. Familial bliss.

I get that shit.

<i>I'm going inside.</i>

See how that motherfucker treat me?

<i>Treatin' you straight.</i>

<i>What you know?</i>
I gotta be an expert?

You gotta know something.
You wanna tell me what's what?

Guy who got me clean was my uncle.

Never touched a needle in his life.

You saying you used?
<i>You hear what you want.</i>

Unh-unh, Joe, not here in the streets.

You gotta put that away.

One pop.

Last one of my life.

Son of a bitch!
That's right, you stay away.

<i>Give me the rig.</i>

I ain't goin' in that hospital

till you get your ass
out of here. You hear me?

I ain't going no place
till this motherfucker

extricate his hormone monster ass

from this situation!

Fine.
Wait, what?

You paid me to get him to the doctor.

He paid you?

Remune-fucking-ration?

You think I done this on
charity work, you junkie ass?

Nice meeting you, Jeffrey.

Good luck.


Now it's just you and me, huh?

Like the old days. Down in the basement.

You need to put that away, man.

Just give me 2 minutes.

<i>2 minutes.</i>

What's going on now, Joe?

Just thinking a little.

Maybe I'll go home.

You know, get...

...truly ready to sort this shit out.

Then we meet here tomorrow, first thing.

Tabula rasa.

Maybe we should go inside as planned.

Otherwise you're a danger to
yourself and others out here.

<i>Wouldn't you say so, Jeffrey?</i>

I would.

No! No!

<i>What's going on?</i>

No! No! No!

No! Let me go!

Let me go!

Jeffrey! No!

No! I tell you it's against my consent.

It's against my consent, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey, please!

Don't do this to me!

Jeffrey, don't! Motherfuckers, no!

It's against my will!

Jeffrey...

Oh, God!

No! No, Jeffrey!

Jeffrey!

Don't, please.

Please!

No!

Please, Jeffrey, please.

<i>Please, Jeffrey, please.</i>

<i>Don't do it!</i>

Don't. Please, don't!

Jeffrey, don't do...

Don't do it!

Please!

No! No!

No!

No!


<i>She trusted, right?</i>

<i>And her trust got broken.</i>

The loss of innocence?

Where did you get that?

Ms. Geller.

So, you're paying attention.

What's that supposed to mean?

Go ahead. Type it in.

She's asleep.

<i>How many chapters did you read?</i>

3.

She's gonna want you here every night.

Say goodnight to your Aunt Meredith.

She's not my aunt.

It's an expression.

See you soon, Allie.
Night, Mere.

Have that done when I get back.

No texting or
IM-ing or e-mailing

or any other kind of pseudo-communication.

This was amazing.

They're amazing.

You made the right choice.

You think?
Then why did you?

The city had made me numb.

Yeah, I get that.
Don't patronize.

That's harsh.
You'd switch places?

Conceptually in a second.

<i>Especially after 2008,
so let's not go there.</i>

I don't believe my husband is in China.

What?

When he called I heard
a siren in the background

it was definitely American.

Sarah...

You forget I spent a year and a half

in Beijing after B school.

I know of what I speak.
Did you say anything?

"Where are you and with whom?

Why do you spend so much time away?"

No.

Just because you don't know...

[scoffs]
No, you're right.

I shouldn't have said anything.

Because why would he?

You're right.

I can stay.

Europe will be humming at 5 a.m.

I know the drill.

I love you.
I love you.

[instrumental music]

[Sarah sniffles]

[music continues]

Ray is a prick and a narc.

You're gonna tell me that superannuated
hippie didn't smoke in his day?

That he still doesn't?


[Hal sighs]

You know mom's right.

We're, uh...

We're gonna deal.

I promise.

[music continues]

So what did you say?

Does it matter?

Maybe I want to know how you lie.

Wow.

<i>The usual?</i>

Thanks.
<i>And you?</i>

Uh, coffee and lox
platter, everything bagel.

Why wow?

It's, it was just a strong
statement, that's all.

What do you want from me, Sam?

This.

Right now.

Like your bagel.
My bagel?

Everything.

[instrumental music on speaker]

Is there coffee?

Oh, I thought you left.

I pushed my first meeting half an hour.

Not sure the girl will show anyway.

<i>Who is she?</i>

Graduate student I was telling you about.

Brilliant, but troubled.

How?

Not sure.

Inscrutable.

Eat out tonight?

I'm hosting the seminar dinner.

I hate the thought of
you walking home so late.

I'll be quiet coming in.

I might be up.

<i>Yeah?</i>

[woman singing in foreign language]

<i>The first time I came to New York</i>

<i>this is where my mum took
us before anywhere else.</i>

<i>[chuckles] I was so pissed.</i>

<i>Why? Where did you want to go?</i>

Shops, noise, the huge
buildings, theatres, streets.

Wha... whatever.
That doesn't sound like you.

Yeah, but then, when
we got there, I was like

"Oh, I get it."

You'll have to tell her you went.

"Oh, that's so sweet,
darling. Who did you go with?"

<i>You don't have to
tell her with whom.</i>

Jesus, I'm having the life
she never had the guts to.

A career.
<i>Oh, bigger than that.</i>

Like, she's never had a place of her own.

Imagine that.

From her parents, to
college and then in with dad.

And of course, I have yet to
live the only life she's known.

<i>Well, would you want that?</i>

I... I am 33.

Friends of mine are having
there kids in their 40s.

And they'll be in their 60s
when their kids graduate college.

Not for me.

You need to know that.

You've made that clear.

<i>It doesn't seem like it.</i>

Okay.

We have 4 days together.

3 and a half.

<i>We agreed that we... And
now twice this morning...</i>

I'm sorry.

I'll do right by us.


I just don't know what that means.

Can't that be good?

<i>Not knowing?</i>

[instrumental music]

[indistinct chatter]

It just seems so irrelevant.

Arguing interpretation
with the other 12 people

<i>that have read the same text as you.</i>

Millions would be more accurate.

Not these days.

Something must've kept you interested

through a master's program.

You become accustomed.

To abject despair?

To choosing a life that
relates directly to very few

but quite directly to everyone.

What if you're fooling yourself?

That very question is what it's all about.

Fooling ourselves?

At the heart of human interaction

is the agreement that we're
all going to fabricate.

Which is to say, agree on
certain precepts we call truths

but would be utter nonsense
to anyone not in on the game.

Consider language.

We call an elephant an elephant

with a certainty that will
go so far as to marginalize

even ostracize those who refuse.

Society depends zealously on
this, so we can structure it.

In this case, communicate with one another

even as each of us has his or her own

disposition toward elephants.

Why should philosophy
in any form be different?

Because ultimately who really cares?

<i>Everyone, regardless
of how few want to try</i>

to understand it, which is why
I've spent my life gorgeously

<i>and so can you.</i>

Why have you done this to yourself, Sophie?

To know that I'm here.

May I ask how?

Curling iron mostly.

<i>If to be wounded is to exist...</i>

...you're giving yourself
a pretty narrow endgame.


Have you sought counseling?

Been to health services?

There is a woman that
I've started to see, yeah.

<i>Is she aware of this?</i>

You have to tell her.

Will you come with me?

Well, you know Mr. Cohen
already makes me paranoid enough.

But that's 2 hours from now.

Besides, he's harmless.

All you have to do is
use the word dichotomy

and he'll eat out of your hand.

I still don't know what that word means.

He actually misuses it.

Specifically it's the rhetorical
contrasting of 2 opposing

or divergent ideas,
thus, the prefix dicho, 2

and then tomy, meaning to cut.

Make out with me.

Hal?

Yeah?

I think I'm ready.

This weekend...

...my parents will be away.

Is this 'cause my mom has cancer?

No, asshole.

It's because I want to.

So it's not a sympathy thing?

If you ask me that one more time

we're breaking up and you
can keep fucking your hand.

Wow.

Friday might be tricky

but I can just tell my
parents I'm staying at Greg's.

<i>I could spend a year
like this, every day.</i>

How do you fit it all into one life?

Mmm. You leave the world
with things still to do.

That's tragic.
Tragic is becoming satisfied.

[sighs]
Why didn't I meet you 20 years ago?

Mmm, the Atlantic Ocean.

Child abuse.

Where's that one from?

Malaysia.

This shape is incredible.
Mmm.

The lower and upper
sepals are for protection.

<i>This petal is the labellum
and it's always the largest.</i>

<i>It lies flat like that to make
it comfortable for pollinators.</i>

All that beauty is... is just
about making more of them.

<i>Right.</i>

Sam?

You've got to be kidding me.

What is it?
That's my daughter's teacher.

I'll take your picture.

<i>And that's my daughter.</i>

Come on.

[instrumental music]

[indistinct chatter]

<i>Sophie?</i>

2 months.

What made you start?

An accident.

With the iron?

Cigarette.

<i>Was it an accident?</i>

<i>I guess not.</i>

<i>Go on.</i>

I... it...

It concentrated me...

...to the exclusion of everything else.

<i>And that was good?</i>

It was like a drug.

What's everything else?


The world has just become...

...so inhuman.

Everyone's plugged in.

Blindingly inarticulate

obsessed with money, their careers

stupidly, arrogantly content.

<i>I can't talk to them.</i>

<i>I fight them.</i>

<i>I wanna destroy them even.</i>

I crave interaction.

I crave it.

But you just can't anymore.

They pull their devices
out for every little thing

to reinforce their
petty, convenient notions.

To decide where they are going to shop

what they're gonna eat, what
movies they are gonna watch

everything they ingest.

<i>Why does that upset you?</i>

Because what is left, oh, my God.

But that doesn't have to be you.

Okay.

It's like this is all a game

and I haven't been told what the rules are.

Or even worse, if I had

I am ill-equipped to follow them.

<i>All I can do is provoke.</i>

I become spiteful.

I'm just as bad as they are.

They? I'm, I'm worse.

I fucking hate myself for it.

I'm, I am so fucking lonely.

Why is the world so base?

Why is it so insensitive?

Why is it so selfish?

Why am I?

[instrumental music]

I am not for this world.

Fucking shit!

<i>You've been asleep a long time.</i>

<i>How long?</i>

From when they say you come in last night?

14 hour.

Seriously?

<i>It ain't up to me.</i>

But you could undo them, couldn't you?

Extricate my ass?

And lose my job?

Where you going?

Other patient.

I'm just hungry like a motherfucker.

We're gonna get you food, bring you water.

You got some crack I can smoke?

I'm afraid not.

You know, just a little bit.

Fire that shit up.

Motherfucker!

Motherfucker!

Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Fuck you! Fuck it!

<i>We were just out of school...</i>

...living uptown.

We both had really lucrative job offers.

She was gonna maybe go to London.

Chose the Far East instead to be with me.

The next logical step
was marriage and kids...

...and we just did that, kind
of without even discussing it.

2 hyper-educated young adults

making the most
significant decision in life

without a single real conversation.

We talked about movies we saw

more than the meaning of a future together.

I remember being, um...

...what would the word be...

...frozen when she was
pregnant the first time.

I thought...

...oh...

...you know, something is definitely over.

And I never stopped to enjoy it.

But you like having kids.

I love having kids.

I get home, you know,
usually too late for dinner.

She's... into her third drink

and I have about an hour before
the girls have to go to bed

and I go into their rooms with
a plate, and I-I don't leave.

Most of our interactions these days

consist of algebra and whatever

self-consciously
multi-cultural book

they're reading at the time.

As they get older, they get...

...quieter.

The older one, Allie, she's,
uh, she's getting belligerent.

Mmm.

Your wife drinks 'cause
you're not really there.

Yeah, that's obviously part of that.


Not exactly the raucous time
we were thinking of, huh?

[both chuckle]

Honest.

That's ironic.
Mmm.

I don't wanna go home yet.

You have to, Sam.

Just one more day.

She's not expecting me yet.

One more day.

Are there friends you can speak to?

Your father?

Your brother, Hal, isn't it?

What is this with me
needing to talk to anyone?

Just to know, others are
concerned and care about you.

And you believe that?

That people care about each other?

We treat people the way
we want to be treated.

It's just a compassion.

I don't consider myself compassionate.

I have no respect for my father

because he is bossed around by my mother.

<i>Now, I not only hate her</i>

but I resent her...

...because it's interfering with my life.

<i>All of this is natural.</i>

And... pretty fucked up too.

You're young.

You don't want your life interrupted.

I love her so much.

<i>Hello, Joe.</i>

Fucking let me out of here.

In about 20 hours, you will
be able to sign yourself out.

So let's skip the fucking hassle.

By law, I've got to hold you for 48 hours.

Hold a man that wasn't hurtin' nobody.

Come into his apartment uninvited

chuck him in a hospital, strap him down.

If you could kill yourself
right now, would you?


Ain't gonna kill myself.

<i>You'll be dead in a year.</i>

You told me that last year.

<i>Last year I gave you 2 years.</i>

We're right on schedule.

<i>Tell that nurse to
bring me my dinner.</i>

Not until I...
<i>I don't think you understand.</i>

You are not here anymore.

[indistinct chatter]

Is that what you were
expecting, Mr. Clancy?

It's opening up.

You want to try something else?

I'm good. Thanks.

Hello, Jeffrey.

You too?

Where is Devlin?
He's here. The full team.

Care to join me?

Think we can be nice to each other?

<i>I'm optimistic.</i>

Excuse me.
His name's Jerry.

First name basis.

Hey, Jerry, this is Rachel.
Yeah.

I'm arguing against her in the morning.

Make sure she is hungover.

[Rachel chuckles]

I'll just have a glass
of that and see a menu.

<i>Sure thing.</i>

[cell phone ringing]
Shit.

I have to make a phone call.

It'll be a second.


[telephone rings]

Yeah, who this?

Hey, buddy, how you faring?

How am I faring?

What am I, on a motherfuckin' yacht?

How are you, Joe?
<i>You fucking left town.</i>

I had no choice.

<i>You always got a choice.</i>

Even I know that and I'm
a motherfucking junkie.

<i>A case I've been
working on for 8 months.</i>

So, that's more important than your
friend that you just dumped in a detox?

To a company with $700
million at stake, it is.

Oh, so that is supposed to
belittle me, make me feel small.

What you workin' for Warren Fucking Buffet?

<i>Maybe you could've picked
another day to fuckin' commit me.</i>

Hasn't your dad been down?

<i>When I was asleep.</i>

Well, he'll be back.
For what?

<i>Says he kept you afloat
for the past 5 years.</i>

And pay for 4 years at Amherst.

You think I haven't heard that?

<i>When you comin' back?</i>

Depends on how long the case lasts.

Hey, man, how much, uh, you make a year?

<i>I read in the newspapers,
you motherfuckers can pull in</i>

<i>2 million plus if you're
a partner at a big firm.</i>

We are not discussing that.

Okay, so what are we going to
discuss because you called my ass.

I have to go, Joe.
Why you hanging up so fast?

I'm in a meeting.
<i>Don't go, man.</i>

I'll call you later.


Don't forget.

<i>You all I got.</i>

I'll set my alarm to it.

I'll be waiting up.

<i>Hey... hey, Joe?</i>

Yeah?

I love you, man.

I've gotta go.

[instrumental music]

So what was Ginsberg like?

Fantastic

No way...

[indistinct chatter]

When I decided...

Fucking call me.

[breathing heavily]

<i>Fucking call me!</i>

[music continues]

[cell phone vibrates]


Why didn't you wake me?

You should get the kids up.

Alright.

Hal, it's 6:45.


No, don't fuck with me this morning.

You know what's happening today.
I don't have the time or energy.

I'm gonna stay at Greg's tonight.

Pardon?

Greg's. He needs, uh...

Are you aware that your
mother is having surgery?

Yes, I thought you'd
want me out of the house.

No, you want to go to Greg's and get stoned

'cause it's harder to do that here now.

That's actually not the case.
We're gonna be together this weekend as a family.

That means while your mom
and I are at the hospital

you're home with Ella.

Okay. That's all you had to say.

I just wish I hadn't.


<i>The best thing you can do for
me is to ace that history test.</i>

I got it postponed.

Ella, don't do that.

You could take it with your eyes closed.

<i>Well, I'm not going to.</i>

What are you going to
do during that period?

<i>Talk with Mr. Werth.</i>

Can't you talk with him during a free?

I don't want to.

Why do you care? I'll take it next week.

I need to feel like your life is going on.

That it will go on.

I'd want it to stop for me.

You won't when you're a mom.

<i>Yes, I will.</i>

Just take the fucking test.

Honey, we should go.

Why do we always have to
play stringed instruments?

It's good for your brain.

So is math and science. So is reading.

<i>Presumably you're being
taught those subjects as well.</i>

They could teach them more and
ditch the hours of violin every week.

Besides, she doesn't let us play any notes.

What do you do?

<i>Spend the first 3 months</i>

learning how to hold the stupid instrument.

<i>You're joking.</i>

It's totally fucking lame.

Watch your language.

<i>And Mrs. Silver is
nationally renowned.</i>

As what?

As a violin teacher.

And your school happens to have the
top strings program in the country.

You know, families move to
Englewood just to go there.

Is that why we moved to Englewood?

No. I mean, I did check
out the school, but...


I hate New Jersey.
I love it.

You're a moron.

I wanted change.

So dad could be gone half the time
and you could get drunk every night?

Holy shit.

Angie, get out of the car.
<i>Why?</i>

<i>Just get out of the car.</i>

Go to Strings.

Don't you ever talk to me like that again

especially in front of your little sister.

You might be a fucked up
little monster, but she isn't.

Well, like you say, mom

smart people, girls
especially, are all fucked up.

You think I'm drinking too much?

<i>It's just wine mostly.</i>

I think you're not happy.

Not happy in the city working.

<i>Not happy in New Jersey not working.</i>

I don't know what...
Just don't drink anymore.

It's not that easy.

<i>Try middle school.</i>
Gladly.

Aren't there drugs you can take?

I'm on to about every one you can imagine.

So are all the moms you can see.

Except maybe Marta, though she should be.

<i>Real mature, mom.</i>

That will probably be the
highlight of my daylight hours.

I'm sorry.
No.

I am.

You should probably get going.

[car horn blaring]

Jesus, fucking sharks.


Gracie.
<i>Good morning.</i>

I need you to give me a hand.

Empty all these.

The ones with screw tops,
you can pour down the sink.

The ones with corks, you can have.

No, I don't drink.

Oh, give 'em to your husband.

Trust me, he'll be happy.

Now.

[bottles clinking]

<i>Are you sure about
these French ones?</i>

<i>He always say...</i>

If he cared, he'd be here.

[indistinct chatter]

Where the hell have you been?

I'm on time, aren't I?

For the meeting 2 hours ago?

[chuckles]
I'm sure you handled it fine.

I'm second fucking chair.

This is open and shut.

They should've settled.

All rise.

[cell phone ringing]

Counselor, I really hope
you're not going to use

that in my courtroom.

Just turning it off, Your Honor.

<i>Hello, you've reached Jeffrey.</i>

<i>Please leave your name,
number and a detailed message</i>

<i>and I'll get...</i>

Good morning, sunshine.

Speaking of which

where's that paperwork
I can sign myself out

to see some motherfucking sunshine?

What happened to a child like you?

Meaning?

Once you must was a good boy.

Done what him told.

How you gone so wrong?

I was 14...

...in the basement of my best
friend's house in Maryland

me and him snuck a bottle
of Sambuca down there

finished it between us.

I ain't never looked back.

This ain't Sambuca.

Discovered the good stuff a lot later.

And your friend?

Now he a fancy nigger lawyer
who don't answer my calls.

<i>Maybe him busy with him life.</i>
Oh, yeah?

You can't see you in charge of yourself

you can't do nothin'.

Do you think I don't know that?

<i>So why you here in a bed got straps?</i>

<i>But then, what do all these
thinkers we've examined this</i>

<i>semester have in common?</i>

If we truly explore to
find a common thread?

At the outset of a century
that would constitute

the bloodiest in human history.

Along with scientific and
technological advancements

that would literally make us like Gods.

Even as we began to dismantle
the very meaning of God.

They ask...

...what is a life?

Does to live any longer have a how?

Does it any longer have a why?


<i>Against a backdrop
of industrialization</i>

<i>people will contend with
alienation, dislocation</i>

<i>population on a mass scale</i>

and murder on a mass scale.

They'll consider the constraints of truth.

Whether metaphor or paradigm

with many concluding actual
truth has never existed.

<i>A nexus in the great human saga...</i>

<i>...when we dared to trade
the organizing bliss</i>

<i>of good and evil, right and wrong</i>

<i>as determined by a
creator for other opiates.</i>

<i>Communism, socialism,
capitalism, psychology</i>

technology, any learnable system

to replace what had begun to evaporate.

The 20th century. My own.

But also the one into
which each of you was born.

<i>For many, an era of hope
liberation, possibility.</i>

<i>For others of
abandonment and despair.</i>

<i>A most human century
in which we begin</i>

<i>really to understand
that Nietzsche was right.</i>

<i>We are beautifully...</i>

<i>...finally...</i>

<i>...achingly...</i>

<i>...alone.</i>


<i>In this void,
philosophy at its worst</i>

<i>becomes self-reflective...</i>

<i>...linguistic, semantic</i>

<i>relativism having
rendered any discussion</i>

<i>of right and wrong, good and evil</i>

<i>to be the quaint
concerns of another age.</i>

<i>At its most provocative,
it asks other questions.</i>

<i>Those concerned with locating
our stranded selves...</i>

...when meaning seems to have died.

He's expecting your call.

So you gonna sign me out or what?

<i>Nothing less, in short,
then why do we live at all?</i>

Call him. Go there.

<i>And what makes us who we are?</i>

They ask what now?

And we're still asking it.

What will fortify us as another century

your century commences?

Do we abandon finally the search for truths

that seem ever more
elusive, even silly to some?

The ethical? The moral? The good?

<i>Principles that by definition
can never be proved</i>

<i>when so much now can be proved?</i>

<i>Or is all this finally
and forever pointless?</i>

<i>Are we done?</i>

<i>We can destroy cities, alter
the planet irreversibly</i>

<i>speak instantaneously
face-to-face</i>

<i>from across the globe.</i>

<i>Create life where
there was to be none</i>

<i>even while intoxicating
ourselves with it all.</i>

And yet, how do we still seek purpose?

And where do we hope to
find it if we're so busy

convincing ourselves there needn't be any?

<i>And so we wander...</i>

<i>...eyes closed to the dark</i>

<i>while technology, science,
medicine and godlessness blaze</i>

<i>illusions around us.</i>

<i>With less to guide us now than ever.</i>

Seemingly omnipotent...

...but more human

<i>and just as afraid.</i>

<i>These quandaries do not
end with this course</i>

<i>in a week from today.</i>

They begin.

And I certainly haven't
taught these writers

for 30 years just so
you can drop references

<i>to existential thinkers
and their antecedents</i>

<i>at dinner parties.</i>

[all chuckling]

The crowd is untruth.

In an era darkened by the false

shade of imperviousness

you and those who pause to question...

...carry the light.

[music continues]

It's been a wonderful 34 years.

<i>Let's not be strangers.</i>

Either to one another or more importantly

to everything we've
learned from one another.

<i>May your best years be yet to come.</i>

And so for us all.

[all applauding]

[all cheering]

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Hey, what are you doing?

That's my purse!

<i>He's taking my purse!</i>

<i>Motherfucker!</i>

So I heard you gave quite the final lecture

in the survey course.

Well attended anyway. Students
I hadn't seen in years.


I'm sorry I wasn't there.

This is me, so...

You made a promise.

I know.
So?

I... I... I can't.

I'll make me a willow cabin at your gate.

Who's that?

Viola from "Twelfth Night."

I said it to my wife 46
years ago when I proposed.

You're gonna be late
getting back to her, so...

And later still the longer we tarry.

I can just get another one.

I can use cigarettes.
A moment at a time.

Hmm...

Sophie.


Thank you.

You're worth it.

<i>Where are you?</i>

I was with a student.

The one I told you about.

<i>Should I wait up?</i>

If you can.

I won't be 10 minutes more.
<i>Okay.</i>



[instrumental music]

You're late tonight, sir.

In all the years of coming here

I've never told you my name.

It's Walter.

It would make me so happy
if you called me that.

Walter.
Ignacio.

Good evening.
<i>Hey.</i>

The allure of that never
fades I'm happy to report.


A couple of bunches of hydrangeas?

You got it.

[indistinct chattering]

<i>Gotta have milk, don't you?</i>

Drink milk all my life.

Maybe you drunk milk too.

Look like you've lived a good life.

I have actually.

What's the secret?

You can't imagine how ironic it is

that you're asking me that today.

Perhaps it's as simple as
enjoying a glass of milk

or buying flowers for
your wife every Friday

which I've done for as
long as I can remember

and which I shall do now.

Could you loan me 5 bucks?

For?

Gonna buy drugs, which I need... awful bad.

Hungry too.

I'm gonna give this to
the man at the register

and tell him you can
have anything in the store

one can eat up to $5 worth

and that he is to keep the change.

Just like that?
Just like that.

And if you ever see me around here

I'll always do the same for you.

So long as I'm able.


Simplicity of the divine.

You've read Augustine?
Not everything.

<i>Don't worry, no one has.</i>

And in translation too.

I'd be lying if I said I
didn't need a moment to process

where this conversation
has suddenly veered.

Come on, man, just help
me out, 50 cents, anything.

Thanks.

Yeah, you better walk away, motherfuckers!

Yo, mister, let me get 50 cents, man.

I'll get you a cup of coffee.

I want 50 cent.
Sorry.

Maybe you should let these
young ladies get to their dog.

You gonna tell me what
to do in my neighborhood?

I've lived here 25 years,
but no, it's just a request.

<i>Thanks.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>
Have a good night, Walter.

Goodnight, Ignacio.

Excuse me. He bought that for you?

That he did.

Anyone who ask, he always.

<i>Buena suerta, ese.</i>

Gonna need that too.

<i>Hey, bud.</i>
Hmm?

You dropped somethin'.

[dramatic music]

Help! Help! Help!


Help me!

Help me!

<i>Yes?</i>
Help me, help me, please!

<i>Who is this? What's happening?</i>

<i>I'm buzzing you in.</i>


Hey!

No, you motherfucker.


No, motherfucker, this
ain't your fucking business!


You're doin' me a favor.

A favor?

End this shit for good.

[music continues]

Hal?

Ella?

Guys?

You're back?

Is it... Why didn't you call?

<i>Get Hal.</i>

Can you at least tell me?

No, not until you're both down here.

They think I'm gonna to be fine, honey.

It was just a big scare.

Oh, my God, oh, my God! Oh, my God.

Ah, careful, honey.

Go get your brother.

That might be difficult.

Are you fucking kidding me?

He's at Greg's getting stoned.

He's at Amy's. He hopes
losing his virginity.

Her parents are away for the weekend.

<i>He said he did a risk assessment</i>

and the benefits outweighed
the potential negatives.

Jesus Christ.

Honey, he can be in trouble in the morning.

Let's just be happy.
Pour me a glass of wine.

<i>You're a lot more
forgiving than I am.</i>

[cell phone ringing]

Mom?

â™ª If your clarinet should break â™ª

â™ª Do not cry a million lakes â™ª

â™ª Do not cry a million lakes â™ª

Okay.

â™ª If the wind surrounds... â™ª


â™ª Do not turn and twist about â™ª

â™ª Just wait it out â™ª

I love you, Hal.

I love you too.

â™ª If your hand should lose its grip â™ª

I love you. I love you. I love you.

â™ª Do not tremble do not sweat â™ª

â™ª For where then would you get â™ª

â™ª Where then would you get â™ª

[both chuckle]

I'm sorry.
It's okay.

â™ª Where then would you get â™ªâ™ª

[instrumental music]

[indistinct chattering]

A 6 centimeter vertical laceration

in the mid epigastrium.

[cell phone ringing]
Abrasions to the head.

You guys get service down here?

There is an air shaft.

Give me a sec, will you?

[indistinct chattering]

Mom? Where is he?
Oh, God.

Where is he...
In intensive care.

He lost so much blood.
But do they say if he...

<i>I don't know. I'm so afraid to ask.</i>

<i>Excuse me.</i>

Do you mind?
I-I'm sorry.

Are you the family of the man who, uh...

Yeah.

I was just, uh, speaking
with the police back at...

In... in any case, your husband
asked me to give you these.

What did he say to you?

Just, uh, just to give you those flowers

and that... that he never missed a Friday.

Anything else?

I probably misheard.

Please.

Please.

Cabbages.

I'm planting cabbages.

[siren wailing]

Oh, my God.

Perfect.

Thanks.

I'm sorry.

Mom?

It's from Montaigne.

"I want death to find me

"planting my cabbages...

"...careless of death...

...and still more... of
my unfinished garden."


[instrumental music]

[cell phone ringing]

Hello.

<i>Hey.</i>

Sam? Is that you?

<i>Yeah.</i>

I, uh, I miss you.

<i>I want to come home.</i>

<i>That's not gonna be so simple.</i>

For either of us.

<i>Forgetting that you're
not even in China.</i>

Sarah...
<i>Forgetting where you really are.</i>

Probably the city for all I know.

I don't even care at this point
which is terrifying in itself.

I'm not gonna be what
I've turned into anymore.

<i>Neither am I.</i>

I don't believe you, Sam.

<i>Anymore than you believe me.</i>

Sarah, it's been a strange night.

It should go without saying that I don't

really wanna know.

<i>No, it's not like that, I'll...</i>

I'll explain it when we uh...

<i>I don't want to see
you right now, Sam.</i>

You wanna come home?

Let's discuss it when you were supposed

to come back from China.

Okay.

<i>And start thinking if this is</i>

<i>where you really wanna be.</i>

[music continues]


<i>The issue is more
what the loss of blood</i>

<i>did to his brain function</i>

<i>in addition to the
trauma of being stabbed.</i>

We can keep his heart beating, but...

<i>Is-is my mother-in-law
aware of this?</i>

She certainly not leaving his side.

Alright. I'm gonna go in there.

Can I, dad?

Sure.

Well, at least he's not in any pain.
