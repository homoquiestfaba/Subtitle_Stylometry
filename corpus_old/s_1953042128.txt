Dr. Forrest,
please dial 1-1-8.

[Electronic beeping]

[Elevator dings]

[Beeping continues]

Honey that's right.
Good job.

[Gasping]
Okay.

Nice job, Erin.
Great job.

Thank you.
Great job.

[Beeping continues]

Okay, ohh...

[murmuring]
Great job.

[Gasps]
Good job.

It's okay.

[Beeping continues]

Doing a good job.
You're alright, okay?

Take some deep breaths.

Deep breaths and push.

[Beeping continues]

[Oxygen hissing]

You're gonna be fine.
You're good.

You're doing good.

Yeah.

Everything looks good,
doctor.

[Beeping continues]

Wait.
Wait a minute.

What?


You're doing fine.

[Beeping continues]

Push, okay?

Good. Good.

[Liquid sloshing]

[Monitors beeping rapidly]

What's the matter?

You're doing good.

Oh, it's hurting.
You're doing fine.


Oh...

Something's wrong, honey.
It doesn't feel right.


What... a scalpel!
No!

Honey...

[Liquid sloshing]

[Rapid beeping]

It's okay, honey.
[Gasps]

[Woman screaming]

No!

[Bell tolls]

[Animalistic roaring]






[Footsteps tapping]

How are you feeling today,
Tom?

Caretti, isn't it?

[Distant shrieking noises]

[Warbling noises]

[Flesh tearing]

[Crickets chirping]

[Car approaching]

[Woman speaking indistinctly
over police radio]

Where are you going?

Chief told me
to get to the new station.

It's getting a little crazy
in there, Caretti.

Where are you taking him?

Over to the new station.

You've got your hands full here.
Why is that?

They dumped the headless
horseman in your lap.

You're kidding me.
No.

Don't they got that
a bit backwards?

Oh, tell it to the chief.

Have fun.

Yeah, real fun.

[Over radio] All units,
148 North avenue...


[Indistinct radio transmission]


[Grunting softly]

[Indistinct radio transmission]

Oh, fuck...

[indistinct radio transmission]


Oh!

[Both grunting and moaning]

That's good.

[Both gasping]



[Lighter clicks]

You know,
you should quit those.

There's that look again.

What look?

All this sneaking around
is gonna be over soon.

Trust me.

Ah, trust you...

my boss,

who takes me into the office
for a quickie.

You know, the media already
has a nickname...

for Jenny Garrison's killer.

I heard.

I'll see you down there.

Hey, um, I...

I... love you.

Tom?

Tom?

Do you want to talk to me,
Tom?

Closure.

Right?

I'm here to help you.


Closure!

Closure!

Closure.

Can you talk to me,
Tom?

Have a seat.

Look at me.

Tom, if you talk to me,

I can get you
out of that jacket.

Talk to me.

We heard you say "magic".

over and over.

What's "magic", Tom?

Inkubus.

The dark stranger.

The one you least expect.

We saw you
holding your baby, Tom.

Help me to understand.

What would we do
without stairs?

We want to get you
out of that jacket.

And all you have to do
is tell me the story.

Tell me about that night
at the precinct.

[Telephone ringing]

Hey, Cole, all right?

Okay.

Why did they bring him here?

Hey, damned if I know.

All I got here is Tech,
Cole, one lousy laptop,

And two uniformed cops,
both of them knuckleheads.

[Water dripping]

What a dump.

Out of all nights,
tonight.

Why tonight?

Hey, lighten up.

Chief thinks you can
handle it.

You know, I could be looking
at a captain soon.


Hey, so listen,

Before you get your bunghole
all puckered up, right,

Lottery's up to $300 million.

If we win,
including you,

we only cut it seven ways.

Why do I feel like...

I've given you $300 million
already?

So what's another buck?

What do you got
on this kid?

About an hour ago,
hospital called up.

This college kid comes in.

He's soaked in blood,

like he took a bath in it.

Thing is,
he's got no injuries.

All the blood belongs
to the vic,

a Jenny Garrison.

He claims he didn't do it.

No fingerprints
other than his.

No signs of forced entry.

Let's talk to him.

[Clears throat]

Miles.
Hey!

[Fingers snapping,
whistles]

Miles?
This is detective Tom Caretti.

He'll be investigating
your girlfriend's murder.

Okay, Miles, so, uh...

where were you
when this happened?

We were...

you know.

Look, you need to tell me
exactly what happened.

We were kissing

And sort of pulling off
each other's clothes.


I went into my backpack,
'cause, you know,

I wanted to make sure
i had, uh...

yeah, a condom, good.


Hey, knock it off!

Or I'll have you
humping desks

From here to the new station,
all right?

Got it?

Sorry, Miles.
Go ahead.

I couldn't find one.

So I turned away
for a second.

You want to see these?

And then I felt...

the hairs on the back of my neck
stood up.

And then when I looked back,

He was standing
behind jenny.

Who?

I don't know who.

He says someone
just appeared there.

I didn't hear a noise.

No door or anything.
No footsteps.

He was, like,
out of nowhere.

[Blade slices]

Her head was swinging
back and forth...

like he grabbed her
by her hair...

and chopped it off
at the same time.

With what exactly?

He had something,

Something metal.

A sword maybe.

I don't know.

He had it,
and then he didn't.

Everything happened too quick.

Did you get a look
at the killer?

I couldn't see
his face,

Just shadows.

So a dark, shadowy figure?

Yeah.

And then what happened?

He jumped out the window.

What floor were they on?

Fifth.

Fifth?

I know how it sounds,

But that's what happened.

Right.


What did you do then?

I couldn't do anything.


Then I blacked out.

When I came to,
i was at the hospital.

Are you sure you don't want
to change your story...

before we submit the report?

Are you sure?

'Cause we dusted jenny's room
for prints.

We looked for signs
of forced entry.

And there is no evidence
whatsoever...

that someone else
was in there...

other than you and her,
all right?

We're cops.
We've done this for a while.

I've heard it 1,000 times.

Where's her head, Miles?

I don't know.
He took it with him.

Where's Jenny's head?

Last chance!

Jesus.

[Dramatic music]

¶ ¶

Oh, whoa!

Stop right there!

Meat, relax.
Calm down.

Take your other hand
out of your pocket...

slowly.

Would someone like
to relieve me of this?

It is evidence, correct?

[Handcuffs clicking]

Arms up.

You have the right
to remain silent.

We'll see who remains silent
after tonight.

Huh, my pretty?

Anything you say...

may be used against you
in a court of law.

You have the right
to an attorney!

If I cannot afford
an attorney.

One will be appointed for me.

Do I understand?
Why, yes, I do.

I can't cuff him.

He's got something
on his wrist.

Here.
Allow me.


What the hell is that?

Careful now.

You wouldn't want to, uh...

shing!
Put your eye out.

Cole, take that.

Mudge, bag.

Hello, love.

This one yours,
lieutenant?

Hey, pal!

Hope you enjoy
group showers...

and eating mystery meat
the rest of your life.

Just as long
as there's no bones.

I don't like bones
in my meat, meat.

All right, everybody,
just calm down.

Tech, write him up.

Have a seat.

Meat, Pax, why don't you
take Miles over there...

and put him
in the holding cell?

Why?

'Cause you're covered
in the victim's blood.

That's why.
Get him out of here!

He just walked in here
with her fucking head!

This is bullshit!


So why don't you relax?

It's gonna be a long night.

Indeed it is.

Well, let's get to it then,
shall we?

I'd like to make
my phone call.


What's the number?


[Line trilling]

It's ringing.

[Line trilling]

[Telephone ringing]

[Ringing continues]

This is Gil Diamante.

Mr. Diamante.

I'm calling you
from the old police station,

a place you once called home.

I don't know
if you read the papers,

But they're tearing the old girl
down.

Who is this?

Ohh...

I am stunned
you don't know.

It's me.

Inkubus.

Inkubus is dead.

You really believe that?

Remember my van.

Remember?

I brought her with me.

Put a cop on the phone now.

Captain Diamante.

Well, I... I haven't
been called that in a while.

It's Tom Caretti
in homicide.

You probably wouldn't
remember me.

I was moving up
when you were...

retired.

You mean when
they carted me off...

to the cracker factory,
don't you, Tom?

Sorry.

It's not like
it's a big secret.

So what's going on
over there?

Well, we gave this guy
his phone call...

and didn't know
what he was up to.

Sorry to disturb you.

No bother.

I'm plenty disturbed already.

Look, I'm gonna call
my caseworker.

We'll be over there
in half an hour.

Uh, okay.

Detective,

I have to caution you.

If there's even
the slightest chance...

that this guy
is the real Inkubus,

I advise you to keep your
hands up and your eyes open,

if you know what I mean.

So good to hear
his voice again.

I do miss him.

You're really pushing it.

Hey, Mudge,
we need that V.I.N. number.

Let's get out there
and move the van into a lot.

Hey, you got this guy?

I got it.

[Phone beeping]

[Line trilling]

Dr. Winstrom, please.

Emily, it's Gil.

I need you to come over here
right away...

and pick me up.

I'd like to get out of this.

Can you promise me...

that we'll have
a civilized conversation?

Yes.

Good.



Oh!
Oh, my god.

[Gagging]
Oh! Oh!



[Flies buzzing]

This shit doesn't happen
around here.

It's like we're in cleveland.

Oh, fuck.

Name.

You used to wear glasses,

thick ones.

But I don't see any evidence
of contact lenses.

Ah... ah.

Lasiks.

Name.

Ever lost something
really important,

just couldn't find it?

And when you did,
there it was,

right where you left it,

right before your eyes.

I'm only interested
in your name.

Well, then, if that's all
you're interested in...

Inkubus.

Cole, call the guys
and tell them to come up here.

Pax, meat,
get out here now.

Bring gloves and bags.

Fuck...

Jesus.

[Man speaking indistinctly
over police radio]

It's like he's some
throwback Nazi freak.

Go on the computer
and translate this.

Tech's on the computer.

Just do it.

No, that's correct.

I like the inverted "k".

Separates me from
all the other Incubi.

They're such rabble.

Date of birth.

Let's see, now.

When was Lucifer
cast out of heaven?

How old are you?

99 years, 364 days,
and change.

One might say
I'm pushing 100.

You look great.

Thank you.


Fuck-Head.

Address?

All of creation.

Super.

"Address unknown".


Oh, this is so boring.

Hey,

Want to have some fun?


Mr. Houdini loved that one.


There it is.

Right where you left it.

Might I suggest
zip ties?

All right.

Cut the shit.
Shut the fuck up.

It's fingerprint time.

[Chuckles softly]

Stand up.

There, hold it.

All right, next.

Had I known you were going
to be so thorough,

I would have had
a manicure.

Like I fucking care.

[Flies buzzing]

What the fuck?

Holy shit.
[Sighs]

Well, why don't you guys
start bagging this up?

Really?

Yeah.

Bring it downstairs
to the storage basement.

Jesus Christ.

Fuck me.


Better not get
any of this shit on me.

Join the force.

High-speed chases.
Catching bad guys.

All right,
give me the hand.

High five?


What the fuck?

I just got this cleaned.

We're gonna need
a bigger bag.

All right, time for you
to look pretty.

Turn your head
to the right.

[Camera clicks]

[Electronic buzzing and humming]

What the fuck?

All right, to the left.

[Camera clicks]

[Electronic buzzing and humming]


Holy shit.

Sit down.

[Keys jingling]


A little jumpy?

I don't like being alone
with this guy, all right?

Would you...

just take him
to the interrogation room.

All right, let's go!

Here, I ran that V.I.N.

And you know what,
do me a favor.

Please tell those two idiots...

to treat Diamante
with a little respect.

He's one of us.

Imagine responding
to a call,

and your wife
is split in half.

And while you're
mopping up the blood,

you find out
that your kid is gone,

Taken by that animal.

He's not a lucky guy.

Hey.

Can I talk to you?
We got a problem here.

I just ran his prints.

I got ten different names,

A different name
for each finger,

All deceased,

all victims
of violent murders.

And you're surprised?

Does anything fucking work
in this place?

Run it again.

I already did.

I got ten new names,
all deceased,

all victims
of violent murders.

We got to get him
out of here.

He's not going anywhere.

We'll take him
to the new station Tomorrow.

Run it again.

Please.

I don't like this at all.


Mind if I borrow
the computer?

Ha.

[Faint echoing murmurs]

[Haunting noises,
roaring]


This doesn't feel right.

What?
You getting sick?


So if no one
could ever describe him...

and he never left any DNA
or fingerprints at the scene,

how did they identify him?

He shot himself
in the mouth...

in a gas station,
in the bathroom.

And written on the wall
was a suicide note...

with Diamante's wife's blood.

[Footsteps approaching]

How you doing, captain?

I'm Tom Caretti.
This is Erin Cole.

Officer.

What the hell happened
to this place?

Looks like a real shit hole.

Well, we're in transition
with the new station.

And, you know, it's...

it's a shit hole.

Detective,
I'm Dr. Emily Winstrom,

Gil's caseworker.

I am to accompany him
everywhere,

and if he is put under
any undue stress,

we're leaving immediately.

Agreed.

I just need him
for the interrogation,

and you can observe.

If you don't want
to go through with this,

we can go.

No, I... I'd like to, Emily.
I need this.

Closure, right?

[Suspenseful music]

¶ ¶

[Music swells]

¶ ¶

I'm Tom Caretti.
This is Erin Cole.

Officers.

¶ ¶

He walks in
the front door...

with Jenny Garrison's head,

drives a stolen van
loaded with human remains.

Doesn't seem to make
much sense, does it?

Serial killer
I'd thought to be dead,

comes back to life
and turns himself in...

after 13 years.

Maybe I'm not so crazy.

Cole, what do you got
on this book?

Some of it's written
in an ancient dialect,

But the title is a direct
translation from German:

"Every hundred years".

May I?

What do you think?

One of my patients
was an old German woman...

who claimed she was impregnated
by a demon,

a demon who needed a human host
to regenerate.

At the end of its 100-Year
life cycle,

he would find a host,
plant a seed,

and die at sunrise.


She claimed the birth
almost killed her.

Her nightmares
were so intense,

She had to sleep
in four-point restraints.

A demon
that does the nasty,

it's, like, right out
of a comic book.

That demon is called
an Incubus.

So...

what is the subtitle
of this book?

Ihr gestalt ist meine.

"Your mind is mine".

Let's see
what he has to say.

Gil Diamante.

You look surprisingly well,
sir.

So...

we finally get to meet,
face-to-face.

Inkubus, right?

Oh, a staring contest.

You know what,
I can stare too.

I have all night long.

Ah, yes.

A good stare,

the summit
where souls connect.

I'm getting tired
of your bullshit, okay?

Before I ask any questions,

Is there anything
you'd like to tell us?

No.

How did you
get in here tonight?

Magic.

Magic?
Like David Copperfield?

no, no, no.

He's an illusionist.

Those are tricks,
misdirection, sleight of hand.

Real magic bends reality.

So how did you get
into Jenny Garrison's room?

Did you just
abracadabra yourself into it?

Yes, and then
I cut off her head...

and left for here.

Any reason?

It's what I do.

Besides, how else was I going
to attract your attention?

So how long has it been now,
hmm?

12, 13 years, Gil?

I'd almost forgotten
how good it feels.

Magic or killing?

Killing is magic.

You see...
it's Caretti, isn't it?

Detective Caretti.

Yes, well...

I had become frustrated

At not receiving the acclaim
i so richly deserve,

So I began using my mark.

The "k"?

Yes, the "k".

Even then, some glory hound...

attempted to take credit
for my accomplishments.

Let me see
if I get this straight.

This whole thing...

is about you getting credit
for what you've done,

kind of like
a little ego trip?

So why should we believe...

that you're not just
some fucking glory hound?

Well, if anyone should know,

it should be you.

You were the best.

You got the closest to me.

When Chris Dawson
was arrested for my kill,

It was you who proved
it couldn't have been him.

You knew you had
the wrong man,

Just like the man I killed...

that the cops ID'd
as Inkubus.

I can't wait to hear this.

Diamante and his team...

were getting close.

You were ruthless,

Relentless.

So I killed a vagrant
to throw off the scent.

You were right, Gil.

But nobody would listen.

So case closed.

I can't imagine the pain
you must have endured,

the humiliation.

But I do like to try.

Okay, we're done here.

Oh...

but there's so much more
left to tell,

all the ones
you don't know about.

Marilyn Sheppard
of Bay Village.

Caroline Connors
of Pennsylvania.

Elizabeth Short
of Los Angeles.

Ambrose Small
of Toronto, Canada.

Catherine Eddowes,
Mary Jane Kelly, all...

all of London town.

Marilyn Sheppard's murder...

was called
the Sam Sheppard case,

Because everybody thought...

her husband had committed
the murder.

Elizabeth Short,

the famous Black Dahlia
from Hollywood.

Shooting a little high,
aren't you, buddy?

Ambrose Small
was a millionaire...

who vanished into thin air
in 1919.

Those other five...

were the victims
of the Whitechapel murders,

1888, from hell.

Bit obsessed,
aren't we, Gilbert, mm?


You have not lost your touch,
sir.

So you're now
Jack the Ripper.

[Slaps table]

I am not finished here,
detective.

Benjamin Bathurst
of Norwich, England.

Jacqueline Forchet
of Gay Paree.

Sofia and Ernesto Giannini
of Firenze, Italia.

And my lovelies:

Lorelei, Adelaide,
Gretchen,

And the Gerhardt twins,
Heidi und Zelda...

from Cologne.

You won't find any records
of murders prior to 1800.

Your kind was a lot less
thorough back then.

1891, they were called
the Cologne murders.

Five teenage girls,
virgins,

were kidnapped
and their bodies mutilated...

and left in the woods
outside the city.

It was further reported that
their bodies had been bled dry...

and that the killer had both
bathed in and drank their blood.

Bravo.

Are you kidding me?

It's an acquired taste.

So why did you
turn yourself in now?

I am not turning myself in.

Gil, here, and I...

have some unfinished business
to tend to.

Sorry about the missus.

We're done here.

Most of those murders
that you just confessed to...

were done over 100 years ago.

You've lost your credibility.

The secret to immortality...

is found in the blood
of the innocent,

like, uh...
your lady friend there,

behind the glass.


Gil, I'm frankly surprised...

that you haven't inquired
about David.

Do you think your son

Would have lived up
to the die-Amante name?

My family name
is Diamante,

not Die-amante,
you fucking asshole.

You want to play games?

Yes!

Abra-fucking-cadabra.

[Door bangs open]

All right, guys.

Put this guy in a holding cell,
please.

You got it, detective.


Look, I was there...

i didn't believe it.

He plays these mind games.

He vanished right in front
of my eyes.

You see what he wants you
to see.

But I saw the truth.

What is the truth?

The truth is,

You don't believe me.


Fuck.

What's the matter,
my puss?

Missed your workout
this morning?

I don't believe this guy.

Oh, believe it,
pretty boy.

Why don't you call me
"pretty boy" again?

True beauty
is on the inside.

[Cuffs jingling]

What the fuck!

Cuff him!


Cuff me, pretty boy.

[Echoing, whooshing noises]

[Grunts]
Ah!

I'll show you "puss,"
you fuck-face.



All the murders
he has confessed to...

are either unsolved
or attributed to Inkubus...

except for two.

In the murder
of Philip Darrow,

His wife was arrested
and sentenced to death.

In the murder
of Caroline Connors,

Her husband was convicted
and died in prison.

In both cases,
the convicted murderer

Was the only eyewitness.

The convicted murderer
claimed that...

they saw a dark stranger
that appeared out of nowhere

And murdered the victims.

Listen to me.

Do not let that thing
out of your sight.

All right?

All your lives
depend on that.

Can we go now?

[Loud banging]

What was that?

Inkubus just hung himself
in his cell!

Oh, my god.

Oh, God, no.
Not again.


Go upstairs.
Lock the doors.

Fucker!
Relax!

Get him up there now.

Lock the doors.

[Shouting indistinctly]

Mudge, get Miles!

Shit, Inkubus must have gotten
into the storage locker,

And he got his wrist knife,
'cause it is missing.

You know what,
I need an A.P.B. on him now.

I need backup.
Now!

Captain, can I count on you?

Not a good idea,
Lieutenant.

My patient needs to leave now.

It's all right, Emily.

I can lend a hand.
What?

Listen,
he's got the experience.

We need all the help
we can get

Until backup comes here,
okay?

Get her in the break room,
barricade the door,

And don't let anybody in.

You ready for this?

I got your back.

[Indistinct radio transmission]

[Keys clacking]

Eighth precinct.

Eight precinct, come in.

We're all so fucked.

We're all gonna die.

You know that, right?

[Game show music playing
over television]

Hello, America,
and welcome to...

Whoa, hey, Doc.

Don't do that.
You'll blow my pump out.

Oh, sorry.

Sorry.

Will ya move?
Thank you.

Just a second.

Here, we have today's
winning lottery numbers.

7.

5.

13.

[Static crackles]

All units,
do you respond?

[Radio transmission crackling]

Hey...
want to have a little fun?

Eighth precinct,
do you read?

[Crackling and beeps]

Is anyone out there?


13.

6.

6.

8.

8!

I'll be god damned.

Go!

I love you,
little white balls.

6.

6?

I'll be god damned.

Stay tuned.
We'll be back for more.

One number off.

That's the difference between,
like, a free ticket...

and, like, 200 grand.

It's the story of my life,
Doc.

So, uh...

how long you been
head-shrinking?

Too long.

Why don't you size me up?

I'm curious.
Just...

We got time to kill.

Please.

And all due respect,
officer,

This really isn't the time
or the place.

You know what,

Everybody's on edge.

Just for a goof.
Sit down.

Caretti, I... I just sent
a distress call to all units.

Did not receive reply.

I'm going down
to the communications room.

[Static crackles]

Careful, now.

I'll be fine.

I got my weapon.

We're all so fucked.


Okay, um...

you...

have a lot of friends here.

You're very well liked.

That's pretty easy to tell.

Close to retirement.

Maybe you've mentally
checked out of your job already.

You got that right.

I'll be fishing in Alaska,

Lake Okeechobee,
Colorado.

You see...

retired already.

Good cops never retire.

I'm still catching stuff.

Where the hell
are those stairs?

[Echoing whispers]

Did you hear that?
Mm.

He toys with you.

He tries
to get in your mind.

Did you see that?

That's Jensen's old office.

[Faint clattering]


Where the hell are we?

We're in the same
fucking hallway.

That's what he does.

Abra-fucking-cadabra.

[Door slams]

[Faint haunting music]

[Switch clicking]

What else you got,
Doc?

You're a peacekeeper.

You don't like conflict.

Your parents fight a lot?

All right, yeah,
that's enough of this.

Perhaps that's why
you've never been married.

Maybe I'm just unlucky.


Very unlucky.

And your luck
is just about to run out.

[Blade rings]

Ah, ah, ah, ah.

[Dial clicking]

[Microwave beeps]

Hey...

hey, what are you doing
over there?

[Clicking and zapping]

Hey, what are you...

don't touch that!

What are you doing?

Ah! Ah!


Ahh!



Ah! Ah!

[Timer dings]

We're all so fucked.

You know that,
don't you?

We're all going to die.

Shut up.

[Exhaling deeply]

We're all gonna die.

Shut up!

We're all...

shut up and sit down!

[Footsteps pattering]

¶ ¶

What's going on?

How do we get upstairs?

[Door slams]

What would we do
without stairs?

Stairs are so important.


[Man screaming]

Ever lost anything
really important?

Just couldn't find it?

She needs my help.

Come on, tough guy.

Come on.

Live up to your name,
meat, come on.

You want some of this,
don't you?

What do you got?


Come on.

What are you afraid of?

Come on.

Let's see what you got,
huh?

Show me what you got.

Give it to me.

I know what you want to do.

Come on, meat!

Show me what you got.

Tough guy.
Tough guy, come on.

Kick my ass.

Come and get me, meat-pie.


[Blows landing]



[Door bangs open]


What's the matter?

No.
I'm fine.

Okay.
I'm fine.


Really, what the hell
is the matter with you?

I don't know.
What's wrong?

I don't know.

Are you saying...

your wife gave birth
to a demon?


I know everybody thinks
I'm fucking nuts.


Would you believe it?

Would you?

Tom, the facts are
that your wife was in labor.

She had a C-section.
She was hemorrhaging.

Do you believe it?

I was there.

That thing was not human.



Jesus christ.

[Static crackling]

[Static crackling louder]

[Indistinct radio transmission]



Caretti, Caretti,
do you read?

[Static crackling]

[Screen clicks on]

Hey!



Miles?

Miles?



Jesus.

I didn't do it.

It wasn't me.

Stop.


Please help me.
Please.

Please, stop.

Miles was right.

We're all gonna die.

[Flesh tearing]


[Body thuds]


You can't pull that trigger.

You can't even move.

There's nothing you can do
about this.

[Blade slices]

[Flesh ripping]


Don't fight it.

That's it.
That's it.


I've never been here before.

Let's just keep going.

There's got to be
a way out.

[Inkubus hissing and murmuring]

[Faint moaning]





Gil...

[inhales sharply]


Emily?

I laid your wife out
on the dining room table

Just like this.


She was so...

so very responsive.


Which is...

which is what you want,
of course.


It can become rather messy
when they fight it.

Ah, ah, ah.

Don't fight it.


The Dahlia
was my piece de resistance.

But your Nancy...

your Nancy was special,

because she was so special
to you,

which is why
I've decided to...

cut the good doctor here
in half...


As a short of tribute
to you, Gil.




You see,

You've ruined me.

You've spoiled me.

After you, I... I just couldn't
get excited anymore.

Ooh...

and now...

now I feel alive.


Thank you.

You fucking coward!

Take me!

You want me!
Take me!

[Snaps fingers]



No.
No!


Magic.

No!


Not again.
Not again.



Hey, Gil...


Oh, you better have not
lost your touch.

[Thunder crashing]

[Loud banging]

[Water dripping]

[Door slams loudly]

David?

So you know...

who I am?

Yes.

Have you been locked up
in that room all these years?

He takes me out.

Sometimes.

Has he ever taken you
out here?

Yes.

This is where I used to come
to think.

Mostly about you.

I never stopped
looking for you, David.

I know.

He pitied that.

He's a monster.
You know that.

All these years...

not knowing whether
you were alive or...

I'm fine.

He taught me.

He's a good father.

What did he teach you?

How weak people are.

You take one simple thing
away from them,

And their lives
are never the same.

They crumble.

He never wanted me
to be like that.

And are you,

like that?

No.

You look just like your mom.

Do you remember living with
your mom and me?

You're clinging to a life
that doesn't exist anymore.

That's all
I've had to cling to...

these past 13 years, son.

I am gonna beat him.
You know that.

You can't beat him.

Why do you think
he's never been caught?

He's a demon.

And what do people,
all people,

have to confront?


Their demons.

Is that what this night
is all about?

Yes.

Tonight,
you get closure.

[Thunder crashing]

Hello?

Is anybody out there?
Come back.

[Static and beeping]

23-09, go ahead.

Make sure they get here.

I'm gonna go on the rooftop,
okay?

Okay... wait!

Just be careful.
Okay?

I love you.

I love you too.

I wanted to tell you this
earlier at the office,

but you ran out so quickly.

I didn't get a chance...

what are you talking about?

The dark stranger...

that's the best
they could come up with.

Of course they couldn't
describe him.

How can you describe something
you can't see?

It has to justify
the awful deed it committed.

They could never explain him

Because they never
truly saw him.

They could sense
he was with them.

But how can that be explained?

He's never been caught...

'cause he's always the person
you'd least expect.

Listen, he's just...
he's messing with your mind.

I mean, this is one
big fucking nightmare, okay?

This isn't a nightmare.

It's all gonna be over soon.

It's all gonna be over soon.

Listen, I need you here,
okay?

Just until backup gets here.

I love you.
All right?

I got to go help Diamante,
okay?

Go, go.

[Thunder crashing]

You saw him tonight,

'cause he let you.

He's giving you the chance
to forget your old life

And live this one,
in this moment.

So where is Inkubus now?

David.

Where he always is.

Really?

You sure
you're thinking straight?

I've never thought
more clearly in my life.

You're not gonna kill
your son.

Put the gun down.
Shut up.

I'm calling the shots now.

You took everything
from me.

Well, almost everything.

You see, you never really took
full control of my mind.

I always fought you.

No, you're wrong.

He's in your head.

No, not anymore.

You killed my wife

And my son.

Dad!

Don't call me dad.

You are not my boy.


Captain, drop the gun now!

It's all right,
Detective.

I figured it out.

It's over.

That's great.

Just take it easy.

Don't do anything crazy.

Just lower the gun, slowly.

Closure, right?

It ends tonight, demon.

No!


No!


[Thunder crashing]


[Police sirens wailing]

It's horrible.

Horrible, yes,
but...

the facts are
your wife that died in labor.

And you have to accept that.


You're just like
everybody else.

You only hear
what you want to hear.

You think I'm a fucking loon.

How can we believe you,
Tom?

How can we believe
that demons

Are ripping people's spines
apart

And cutting people in half?

How are we going
to believe you?

There's evidence there.

The truth is that
you had a trauma.

The truth is that
you lost a baby.

You lost people
you love very much.

And you are dealing with it
by fabricating illusions...

and making up demons.

Your mind is creating
a reality that you can live in.

Your wife died in childbirth,
Tom.

She hemorrhaged.

They attempted a C-section...

deep breaths and push.

And it failed.

But the more you look
at the cold, hard facts...

for what they are,

The more you can achieve
closure...

honey, honey, honey!

Real closure.

This is bullshit!

My wife didn't die
in labor.

It was him.

Every 100 years,
he finds a host,

and that host
happened to be my wife.

You don't unders...
no, again, I'll tell you!

The demon came out
of my wife's stomach.

Tom,

do you realize
how this sounds?

There is a demon out there!

You don't understand!

I told you a million
frickin' times!

One more time,
there is a demon out there!

He is killing everybody!

There is a demon...
where are you going?

You need to talk to me now!

You wanted to talk.
We're gonna talk.

There is a demon out there.

Get out of here!

There is a demon out there!

I'm telling you!

There is a demon!
