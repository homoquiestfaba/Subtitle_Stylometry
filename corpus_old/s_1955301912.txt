Whew. Good job.

[laughs]
Thanks.

So on our TV show,

will it show us
having sex?

Oh, yeah, like, a lot.

Yeah.

I guess I feel

two ways about that.

I mean, I think

it's very important

to show two women...

I don't know...

Being casually intimate

with each other.

But also, like, it's us,

and we're, like,
real people.

We're a couple.

Yeah.

Well, but if

we don't do it,

then it's like

no actual lesbians

are on TV having sex

with other women,

and then there's

no women on TV

also, like,

having sex with
other women period.

I mean, like,
maybe that happens,

But then, like,

or they both die.

one of them dies,

Like they're warlords,
and then they die,

Or they, like,

and then they die,

sleep with a man,

or they're, like,
at school, and they die.

They are - an art professor,
And they die.

Was she a professor?

Anyway, my point is

I just want us to live.

[music playing]

CAMERON: You know - what else we should
Talk about

Is that when we drove

RHEA: Mm-hmm.

out here, we had...

We drove two cars - in tandem with
Walkie-talkies.

Walkie-talkies.
And we pulled off

At a scenic...
Like, in Utah?

Where we in Utah?

Who can ever tell?

Somewhere scenic,
and then this car

Drove up behind...
Third car.

To be in this rest area.
Indeed.

And then two dudes

got out of it.

And they were like,

on your walkies,

"Hey, we heard you

so we got off here,

to meet you."

and we wanted

And we were like,

"We're gonna
get killed here."

"We're gonna go."

I also wonder who had

a scarier surprise,

us...
Us or them?

Or them?
Were they were like,

"These seem like women - that might be
Interesting."

"Oh, check out
these chicks."

"Let's get off
and meet these chicks,"

And then there's
just these haircuts.

So would you mind

if I weasel my way

onto your show
for 10 minutes?

Oh, my God. Maria,

we'd love to have you.

Just yesterday,
Rhea and I watched,

Like, four hours
of your videos.

We only stopped
'cause my phone died,

But then I just kept
acting them out,

'cause I know them all
by heart.

Ohh! So Rhea's

your girlfriend?

Yeah, and my cohost

on the show.

Oh, you're both comics.

Yikes.

I mean, I mean,

that's great.

There's, um...

a lot of built-in

competition and...

Oh, it doesn't come up!

We never
talk about that.

I'm so excited to meet her.
[cell phone rings]

Oh, you know what?
I gotta get this.

It's, uh, my mom.

I sing her to sleep

every night with a lullaby.

[like rock ballad]
â™ª Yeah... â™ª

Why didn't you
introduce me?

I'm sorry.

She took a phone call.

It's fine. - Just add it
To the pile.

Oh, my God.
This is not that.

She totally
girlfriended me.

Not on purpose.

People only
ever talk to you.

"Thanks for

your show, Cameron."

inviting me to do

"Oh, you're - such a great host,
Cameron."

"Hey, do you
want the rest

Of my peanut butter - banana milkshake,
Cameron?"

I love peanut butter

banana milkshakes.

And I'm
lactose intolerant,

So the milkshakes are

kind of a fuck-you to me.

I am more than

just your girlfriend.

Agreed.

I am my own person.
Totally.

And you are
your own person.

And your person

my Whitesnake shirt.

is wearing

Well, I like how it

makes my arms look.

I can't even

under my jacket.

see your arms

But I'm still flexing.

Men and
women anymore?

Don't you think
that's stupid?

Am I right?
Danielle's coming tonight.

Oh, great.
So your agent

Is gonna think you
like Whitesnake.

I like Whitesnake.

Yeah, she's here to,

like, show an actor friend

me doing stand-up
so that, like,

There's a potential
opportunity.

I don't know.
I'm pretty sure

I'm gonna be in a movie.
Great.

Can Kent even do
less than 20 minutes?

I've never
seen him do it.

I know.
Give me your phone.

Come on. Nothing?

Do you foot the bill?

Nothing on double lights.

And I know you're,
like... you're wishing...

Hey, Danielle's here.

Oh, my God.
She's with...

Melina Marquez.

She didn't say

Melina Marquez.

her actor friend was

Melina Marquez
is at our show.

I love every movie
she's ever been in.

You love her arms

she's been in.

in every movie

It's like she's always
wearing a Whitesnake t-shirt.

Okay, thanks.

I'm Kent.
You were fine.



Okay.
That seems extreme.

One more time

taking his time.

for Kent, you guys,

Oh, well,

we got a great
next comic for you.

You guys
are gonna love her.

Let's hear it
for Sam Jay!

Sam Jay.
[cheering]

Have a great show.

I am so glad

to be here, guys.

Cameron,

that shirt is dope.

I got that shirt

17 years old

when I was

at a thrift store
for $2.00,

And then I lost it

of my dresser

in the back

until my mom
found it.

I cried when she
shipped it to me.

And now some woman

in a sundress

is gonna

of you in it.

post a picture

Oh, my God.

about this shirt.

I don't even care

I just care
about Melina Marquez.

Just switch with me.

I... Okay. I mean...


Still technically
my shirt.

Ah, so?

Oh, you look cute

in your little undie shirt.

This is
sexual harassment.

I am at work.

Well, you should sue me.

Well, your dad's
my lawyer.

Sounds like a real

conflict of interest.

Mm-hmm.


That smells like you.

Veggie bacon.

KENT: Dude,
I'm telling you, man.

It's like Pryor,
then Louis C.K.,

Then you, dude.

You're right there.

Thank you.

Yo, Cam,

why is your audience
so chick-heavy?

Seriously, there were,

in the front row

like, three girls

giving me
resting bitch face.

Like the whole time

the 17-minute mark?

or after you hit

Please don't say,
"Bitch face."

Why not? You know what?

I'm glad you said that.

Explain to me
the rape fantasy then, okay?

'Cause women,
you're in bed with 'em,

They want you
to call 'em bitch,

But then, like,
when you're anywhere else,

You can't
call 'em bitch anymore?

I don't even

unpacking this for you.

know how to begin

I'm not gonna try.
Please don't.

Just explain what the fuck

this is instead.

RHEA: Uh...


Rhea, you look

like James Dean.

Sorry for the insult.

Oh, God.

Why does Kent exist?

But seriously, though,

what is that poster?

Oh, I had it made
for the theater,

'cause we're more
than just girlfriends.

We're comics

with our own show.

We're James Deans,

remember?

He doesn't even realize

that's a compliment.

It is a bit much.

I like it.

I'm gonna do time, okay?

I just feel like
Melina's here.

Honestly,
I'm thinking about it

As if it's an audition

for her next movie.

Of course. - Why wouldn't
A stand-up comic

Go into outer space

with Melina Marquez?

Yeah, that's what
I'm saying.


Hey. Hey,

sorry I'm late.

Oh, hey, Dave.

What the fuck is that?

Hey, Rhea,
I'm next, right?

Yep. Mm-hmm.

Oh, Bob,

do you know Dave?

No.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Mr. Bob Herzog.

Give it up for Bob.
[cheering]

Hello, you gorgeous,

soulless fuckers.

Cameron Esposito,

everybody.

She's kind of funny.


Sexual assault's
been in the news lately.

I don't know
if you've noticed.

If this year's

taught us anything,

it's that society

a woman's been raped

will not believe

unless 48 other women

by the same guy.

claim they were raped

Yeah.

That's why I only

raped 47 women.


Cut it off right there.

That is it.

I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

Okay.
I'll be back.

Yeah. I got it in here.

Okay.
Like a certain person

That... I don't know...

not have heard of.

You might or might


Oh, I'm sorry.

We thought this

restroom.

was the women's

I am a woman.

Oh, of course. I...

You're in
a different shirt.

Yeah. It's my shirt.

They're all my shirts.

Oh.
I'm sorry.

Oh, no, no, no.

Come on in. Have a seat.

This is my office. Heh.

Yeah. So I'm so sorry

about earlier.

I feel like
I blew you off.

I didn't know
you were you.

Oh, no,
Cameron is right.

I'm too quiet.

She would never - let herself
Be ignored

Or seen

in her own clothes.

If I could tell myself

not to fall for people

that I would have

for the rest of my life,

to be telling jokes with

I wouldn't, you know?

Maybe one.

Six.

But that's
how I found myself

And a very good remedy

for U.T.I.s

and my comedic voice.

Wow.

I love your voice.

It's how I imagine

God's voice would sound.

Ohh.

There is no God,

but that's why you need

to speak up for yourself,

'cause you're super-duper.

You're fantastical, okay?

And, uh,

you can use my office.

Pens are free.
Great.

What's the Wi-Fi
password?

Uh, officepeepo.

Great.

Do you want to stay

for the rest?

Please no. Honestly,

I like comedy.

I don't think

RHEA: Ah, come on.

Oh, you're funny, though.

Thank you.

Hey, you wanna go home

and watch "Carol"?

For the third time
this week?

Okay, Therese.

[cell phone chimes]

Oh, God,

must be so hard.

being a stand-up

I could never
do that job.

Yeah. Babe, can you

drop me at the E.R.?

Some idiot broke his jaw

in a bar fight.

Sure. I'll spend time

without you.

with Cate Blanchett

Hey, are you okay?

Oh, yeah. I mean,

I just got sirred
in the bathroom,

But I did get to talk
to Maria, so...

Sweet.
It's okay.

I don't understand.

to use the word "bitch,"

If I'm not allowed

then what am I supposed

a crazy bitch?

to do when I meet

Ooh, I'm not okay

"crazy." Yeah.

with you using

Me either.

I'm surrounded.
Mm-hmm.

Yeah, man.
Read the room.

Uh, Maria,
you are on next,

So what do you need

to get pumped up?

Like French fries,
waffles?

Like, nothing.
Water?

I'm okay. I'm okay.

You know what?
I'll take a water, Cam.

Oh, yeah. Okay.

Thank you.

We gotta go.


[Bob continues indistinctly]

you know,

off the top of my head.

You guys are okay.
I was awesome.

Have a great night.
Thank you so much.


Oh, guys.

Keep it going

for Bob Herzog.

Man.

Hoo.

Spicing up the stage.

Spicy.
Speaking of which,

I'm wearing
a different shirt.

This shirt is also
a little spicy,

'cause it used to be

on your body. We switched.

We switched, 'cause

Whitesnake is a band

that only Rhea

knows about apparently.


Right, Rhea?

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm just, uh, reliving
past personal trauma

Through the, uh,
rape jokes

And rape conversation

tonight.

that's been going on

Oh, yeah. Yeah,

at this show.

a lot of rape

Not... That's

to say that,

the wrong way

but onstage and
conversationally.

Why is it that

the only dudes

that will talk

dude comics,

about rape are

and then it's just,
like, all the time?

All the time.
I mean, it is...

It's dude comics,
but then it's also,

Like, dude TV writers

and dude screenwriters

and dude book writers,

you know, writer writers.

Right, comic books,

all that stuff.

claymation,

All that stuff.

I think

is entertainment.

it's because rape

Yeah. I mean, what would

female characters be doing

if they weren't
getting raped?

Oh, um, wait.

Marrying a man...
Mm-hmm.

Or having a baby...

Yes.

Or she marries
a woman,

Then she cheats

with a man,

on the woman

gets pregnant,
has that baby,

Kisses a woman,
dies.


Those are
the stories.

Those are all
woman things.


Oh, but you know
what is not...

Hmm?
Just a woman thing?

Rape.
Oh, yeah.

That's
for everybody.

Rape is for everybody.

Kind of nice gift

to us all.

From statistically

mostly men.

Yeah, mostly men.

Gotta bring that up
at the end.

You guys, - we got a great
Final comic...

[cheering]
on the show tonight.

You are
gonna love her.

She's a personal
favorite of mine.

I admire her very much.

She's a real legend.

Let's hear it

Maria Bamford.

right now for


[growled whisper]
Gonna get you.

I'm getting you.

I'm getting you.


Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh, I would love

with someone.

to sleep in

That sounds
so romantic.

I don't know.

But we are

fostering a rooster,

and he knows

his job, okay?

Is there anything better

than Maria Bamford?

No, not at all.

It's like the show's

bananas all night,

and then just Maria.

I love doing this show.

I know.

I love doing this show

with you also,

'cause I love you.

Hey, gang, here's

I just overheard.

a funny thing

Um, "Final comic
of the night."

"Final comic
of the night"?

Oh, Dave,
we forgot about you.

Guys, I blew off
a Sadie Hawkins dance

For this
that I was chaperoning,

And you know how much

at school

I like the energy

when the girls are
asking the boys.

Ah, Dave, I'm sorry.
Hey, uh,

We'll go

tell everybody

out there and just

we have a surprise
headliner,

And you can go on
after Maria Bamford.

Oh, fuck you. - I can't follow
Maria Bamford.

Come on.
Yeah.

Actually that's, like,
legitimately a bad idea.

Is that funny?
How long you been doing this?

Like three years?
One year.

Rhea, don't...
I'm looking for something.

Oh, there. I found it,

looking for.

found what I was

MARIA: And if you're not...

You're being
a little baby.

Shut up.

No, you say that
for every show.

Just stop. Stop.
Shut up. All right.

I'll see you. I'll see you.
Yes. Call me.

Peww peww peww.
Girls.

Cameron.

Hey, Danielle.

Oh, my God.
Kent was just talking

About how wonderful

you are. He's so sweet.

He was?
Oh, yeah.

Yeah, he...
He's a huge fan of yours.

He's the reason I saw you

in the first place.

He said you were, um,

reckoned with."

"A force to be

Um, okay.

Yeah.

Hi, Rhea. How are you?

Hi. Good.

I love Whitesnake.

I mean,
w-whose shirt is that?

Is that yours?
It's mine.

Okay. Well, this is
Melina Marquez,

And I think

that the three of us

should have lunch
next week.

Such great stuff. Heh.

Yeah. No, you just

have such, um...

Like a presence.

It's great.

I... I like every movie

you've ever been in.

Okay.
[laughs]

She's...

Okay, we'll set up
the lunch.

Oh, this is Rhea.

This is Rhea.

Kent likes me?

That's what

of this situation,

you're taking out

that Kent said

about you?

something nice

Not that

just touched you

that hot woman

and studied
your pupils?

Did she look in my eyes?

Ecch. Yes, a lot.

You have to get
Maria offstage.

Okay. I'm coming.

Ugh. I know.

Oh, those hands

have been to space.

Fake space.


Give it up
for Maria Bamford!

You guys.

So good.
So good.

And actually
while you're at it,

Why don't we keep it going

I'm Rhea Butcher.

Thank you, guys,
so much for coming out.

Have a great

rest of your night.


Oh, thank you so much.

Yeah, for sure.

Maria, thank you

so much for doing the show.

Great job, you guys.
You were so wonderful.

Be careful.
Don't get raped.

It's not as funny

as you think.

Yeah. That is good advice.

Let's go home...
Mm-hmm.

And watch

movie.

a Melina Marquez

Sounds great.

Which one? - Where she goes
To space?

I don't know.
Or the deep sea?

How about when she's

in deep sea in deep space?

I know! How'd they get

the water out there?

[overlapping chatter]

There you go.

Ugh. That isn't

staying here?

No. I showed it to Mike.

He was like,

"No, I don't want that,"

and laughed and walked away.

God, some people
have no taste.

Well, I don't know
about that.

You guys valet?
Don't you know

Medicaid's gonna dry up

by the time you're 40?

Hey, uh, Bob, sorry

onstage tonight.

we dissected your set

Super rude.
I don't give a shit.

You're welcome
for the new material.

Oh, if you're

around this week,

maybe the three of us
could get dinner.

That sounds terrible.

Also, I'm going on tour.

You know, theaters,

several thousand seats,

you know,
venues worthy of me.

Actually, Cameron,

I don't have an opener yet.

Do you wanna come?

Yeah, that would
be awesome!

Cool.
Is that okay?

Yeah.
Yeah, totally.

Cool.

And, Rhea,

sorry for whatever
you went through.

I didn't know you were
a survivor of assault.

Thanks.

I am, too.

I am, too.

I am, too.

I am, too.

I am, too.

Wow.

Okay.

You still want to come

on the road, though, right?

Yeah, of course.

Sweet.
