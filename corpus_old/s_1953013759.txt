Words are tools.

We use the words

to create.

To create.

That doesn't necessarily mean to build.

It means, sometimes,

we use words

to chip away

at ourselves.

Ronnie?
Yes, baby?

Are you okay there, hon?
You know I am.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

Okay. I don't want you to miss your flight.
I'm coming out right now, baby.

Okay.

Hello.  How are you?

I'm in pain.

So, you...

you need something?

Yes.

I do.

Please,
concentrate on what you're doing.

Remember:

The train of thought,
the flow of ideas from your brain,

down to your pencil,

onto the paper,

into your eyes,

back into your brain,

and around again.

Daddy!
Hi, Daddy.    - Hi, Dad.

Team Princess.

Is anyone paying attention?

<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

I wasn't scared.
I know! I can see that.

So, enjoy your week of freedom, people.

And remember, every time you
crack open that "Farewell to Arms",

I have impinged upon your freedom,

and I am resolutely not sorry!

Dad, I need some money for the weekend.
Yes. Money. Money. Money.

Here we go.

Miles?

Bye, Dad.

See you soon.

Bye. Love you guys.

I love you!

<i>Timothy!</i>

<i>This, my friend,
is your friend, Richard.</i>

We'll be celebrating your
birthday on this holiday, yes?

See? I did not forget you.

Big Sur, sir.
You have all the info.

Just look for the
balloons on the gate.

Meow, meow,
meow, meow!

Turn my fucking music down.

Richard! Uh huh.
Come here.

God, you don't age.

What it up with that?

What, do you got a painting
of yourself in an attic somewhere?

What's the secret?

For old time's sake, huh?

Huh?
Maybe a drink.

To start anyway.

Lovely car, by the way.
Very you.

Yeah, I bought it from some guy
on the way from the airport.

I saw the sign, and POW!

Impulse buy.

Well, I intend to
destroy it in the next 4 days.

Some things never change, Richard.

What is it?

Timmy?

Jill's.

I've been wearing it again.

5 years ago this month.

God, has it really
been that long? Jesus.

I'm so sorry.

Every time I see you,
you say those words,

and I always believe you.

and you never try
to tell me to forget.

But,
per usual,

it is my job
to remind you

that this week
is about forgetting all that,

if only for a moment.

Hm? Mm-hmm!

Ho!

He lives!

You cannot be cynical, and expect
to have any kind of success,

Especially, if you claim
to be an artist.

I'm tired. Sick and tired

[Phone ringing]

Ronaldo's here.
<i>- Uh oh,</i>

my liver just had a heart attack.

Hey, you need anything else,

I'd be happy to pick it up
for you in the morning.

This is her.

So pretty.

She's all grown up, Ron.
It's crazy.

Hey,

is she getting cock yet?

I pray for your soul, Richard.
You cannot pray for a soulless man.

Oh, yeah? Ronaldo,
let me ask you this:

When your sixteen year-old
daughter's hot friends

come by,
do you ever

think about what
it might be like to...

to fuck them in the ass,
'til they're cross-eyed?

I told you! See? See?
Shut the fuck up.

Pass the blow.
Told you.

He never changes, huh?
I merely say what others think,

but fear to say.

You want some honey?
No, don't tell Mommy.

Oh my God, look at this!
It's the first time in the history of

Internet real-estate
photography,

the place is as big in real
life as it was online, huh?

Perfect. Let me know when
you want to settle up.

It's already settled.

The rich are different from
you and me, Timothy.

Thank you.

We've always been different.

Well, you're welcome,
by the way.

Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

I was there!
You were not there.

Of course I was there!
I would pop my head out, and--

And he gets busted.
I'm the guy!

I popped my head out,
and I just go...

to let you know, that I
was going to bail you out

So I said,
"How much for bail?"

And he looks at me, and he goes,
"That's him, right there!"

No, I wasn't!
The cop fucking busts me, and...

You weren't there. I don't remember you there.
I ran off.

No, you weren't there.

The doctor is in!

He certainly is!

What,
and how much?

Enough to treat the
illnesses at hand.

Welcome back!

Amanda,

during her pregnancy,
was getting incredibly...

nauseous.
And what do think it was from?

Do, tell.
I'm dying to know.

It was me.

It was my scent.
No, seriously.

Four months of her pregnancy,

I have to sleep in
the other room, okay?

But, I have
become a

professional masturbator.

What the fuck is this shit?
What are we talking about?

I see you guys
once a fucking year!

It's my life!

How's the world of dating, pal?
It is what it is.

Oh, come on.

You sedate them,
and then it's your right

and your privilege to take
what's rightfully yours, correct?

I hope you're doing that.

Why don't you tell us about

what you told me?
About that fucking 20 year-old blonde?

Thanks, Richard.
I don't think I can stay here for this.

Come on.

I don't think I can stay here.

When you told me, it just
sounded like you should

fucking get it off
your chest, you know?

It was a one-time-only thing.

The girl came in,

late in the day.
She was pretty,

to say the least, and

it had been a while for me, and I...

**

Yeah, but skip to the part where
you sent the receptionist home.

I did things.

I basically lost control.

Looking back on it,
I really feel that I

stripped her.

Oh, you fucker!

She gave me crabs.
Really?  - She gave you crabs?

I fucked her boyfriend,
Jeff Snyder.

That's so fucking funny.
What?

When I fucked Emily,
I gave her crabs.

which basically means,
I gave you the crabs!

Fuck off!

I banged her. When I banged her,
I knew I had fucking crabs.

Take your crabs back!

It's the gift that keeps giving, huh?
You still have them, sir?

You know how to get rid of them,
by the way? This is true.

Take a really good,
good lighter, and

you shave one testicle, and

you light the other testicle on fire.

The critters run
from the burning testicle

onto the shaved one, okay?

And then you just
take an icepick and you just

jam it into the fuckers!

Aah! Aah! True.

Is it possible to have a conversation
that's a little more serious?

No!
Why?

That's what I fucking hate, man.

These people. We cannot do and say
the things that make us feel good?

you lose all credibility.

Blah, blah, blah.
Come on.

You are pathetic, Ron, because

you don't need to participate in

have women, but, like,

the woman.

we're going to be here all day.

Fucking nice.
We're having a reunion.

Heave ho!

Let's do it!

Hey, Timmy, I think I got one!

So, this is a reunion, huh?

We all went to college together.

Jonathan and Richard

have known each other
since grade school.

We meet every year, somewhere.

That's nice. It's...

It's nice. It's good to catch up.
Sure is.

I left school when I was 14.

Sea kept me moving,
so I never had any reunions,

except with my wife,
after long fishing trips.

She died
eleven years ago.

Cancer.

So, I spent most
of my days out here

just drifting around,
trying to figure things out.

I realize that I was lucky
to have felt something that

looked, or smelled, or

resembled real love.

Most folks never taste that.

I tasted it,

and it made
every day anointed.

Nothing mattered,
when we were together.

And when we were apart,

I felt him.

I felt him,

like my own breath.

Do you believe in heaven?

I wish I did.

You still write?

Yeah, I write.
I write all the time.

I write...uh...

report cards.

I write on chalkboards.

I write to the school board
to ask for more money.

Sometimes, I write,
"Dear God, when you get a chance,

can you tell me

we both do, and

it's defined.
I know my role.

I still don't know

why I've done the things
that I've done.

I'm in trouble, Rich.

I'm in deep,

drowned in motherfuckin'...

trouble.

Want me to go get the food?
All right. Yeah.

Sounds good.

Uh, did you have a
large order to go?

Yeah, well, um...

Is there anyone else here
who might have my order?

Just one.

God damn, I bet you that's mine.

Would you like to pay now?

Well, yeah.

'Course.

Would you like to
come home with my order?

I'm working.

You should probably
work on your lines.

If I work on my lines,
would you consider my offer?

No.

She likes me.
She likes me.

Looks like you're
feeding an army there.

Walk out with me.

What?

Why don't you
take that apron off?

Throw it on the floor.
Walk around the bar.

Leave, with me, right now.

You're really high, aren't you?

You say that like you like it.

I'm gonna give you my number.

I'm in town for three days.

I have three friends.
We're harmless.

Fun.

Maybe you have three
friends; want to come over...

It's up to you.
Hey,

So, anyway, this rich guy
Greenberg moves into town.

and he's building this
ugly 25,000-foot mansion

right on the ocean
in front of my mom's house.

She tried to stop him legally,
but he just crushes her with his money.

Fuck, he's putting in a helicopter pad.

Hey, you know, if the guy
can live like a king,

then why the fuck not?

Why does total excess
equated with living like a king?

I mean, why do
people need all that shit?

'Cause the shit is there.

That's crazy.

You actually believe that?

I don't believe it. I know it.
No, you can't know something if it's a choice.

Where'd you learn that college bullshit,
from your philosophy professor?

No, I'm just saying,
people don't need certain things,

even though they might think they do.
How the fuck would you know what people need?

Who pays your tuition?

Huh? Who pays
your fucking rent?

Mom and Dad.
You're a little fucking infant

in diapers, you fucking bitch.

Why don't you come and talk
to me when the naÃ¯vetÃ© wears off, alright?

â™ª <i>Walking back to you</i>

â™ª <i>is the hardest thing that</i>

â™ª <i>I can do</i>

Jane.

Jonathan, do you have
any idea what time it is?

5:30 in the morning,
and Miles is sleeping.

I just want to hear his voice.

And you know that Daniel works late.

Yeah, so he can control
the fucking world's oil markets,

'cause he makes so much money,
and the rest of the country is so broke.

Are you drunk?

No, I'm fucking high.

I'm high as fucking shit.

You get together with your old friends,
and you can't even pretend that you're grown-ups?

I'm pretending you still love me.

Jonathan, stop.

I'm hanging up.

Jane, just...
just...

just tell him again how it went.

from you loving me, to not loving me.

â™ª <i>Just like honey</i>

â™ª <i>Just like honey</i>

â™ª <i>Just like honey</i>

â™ª <i>- Just like honey
Just like honey</i>

â™ª <i>- Just like honey
Just like honey</i>

â™ª <i>- Just like honey
Just like honey</i> â™ªâ™ª

Oh, it's that what it...

that's what paper is.

You gotta stay on top of it.
What kind of shit do you write?

Oh, I just write stories.
Things that mean something to me.

Ah, the personal stuff.

God, no, he's so great.

He's really amazing.

And, then, so, you...

you submit them, right,
to quarterlies? Crap like that?

My last one actually
ran in <i>The New Yorker</i>.

So proud!

And then, you'll write another one.
And then, you'll get the heat

behind you that will push you through

to write the novel.

To type the end.

And then? Fuckin'...

What?

I don't understand.
I mean,

is there something wrong that?

You published a book.
I'd love to be able to.

I was like that.

I was so fucking excited

about this,

and about that,

but you just...

you think it's going to be so fucking rosy.

So fucking rosy...

Well, Jonah's not like that.
No?

He doesn't think anything is
going to be one certain way.

He just loves to write.

You don't have to speak.
You live in some sort of

disillusionment.

because it's easier than being honest.

What are you hiding from, old man?

You think that he's going to
be like you when he's older?

'Cause it makes you feel
better about yourself.

I still love it.

Let me see your heart.

You look just like my sister, Jill.

You should ask her to come over.

I can judge for myself.

No, it's impossible.

She's dead.

How did she die?

You can tell me.
I killed her.

I killed her.

I killed my boyfriend.

I killed him.

I killed them in a car.

This place we live,

this is a state.

A stop on the way.

True nirvana only happens when you die.

They were lucky.

Death is something to attain.

Do you see them alive,

when you close
your eyes to go to sleep?

Let me be her.

Let me be her.
