  PLEASE DON'T.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WHEN YOU'RE A PRO,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

               ONE-TWO. ONE-TWO.

                  ONE-TWO-THREE.

              DIED ABOUT
              THREE MONTHS AGO.

              <i> ONE-TWO. ONE-TWO.</i>

OH, MAN. I DIDN'T KNOW.

I WAS INSIDE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

       WELL, I'M RUNNING
       THE PLACE NOW.

       THAT'S HOW IT IS.

WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIM?

       CANCER. LOOK, MAN.

        ALL THE STUFF
        THAT WENT DOWN WITH YOU,

     AND YOU JUST GETTING OUT
     OF PRISON, I CAN'T HAVE YOU

           UP IN HERE, MAN.
           KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

HEY, COME ON, MAN.

        NO, YOU COME ON, SUCKER!
        THIS IS HOW IT IS.

MAN, I REALLY NEED THIS.
IT'S ALL I'VE GOT.

               YOU LOOK PAST
               YOUR PRIME AGE.

MY MAN, ALL I WANT
TO DO IS TRAIN.

YEAH. IF DOC WAS HERE,
HE'D LET ME TRAIN.

                 DOC AIN'T HERE.

       NO.

NO, HE SURE ISN'T.

             <i> LET'S GO! ONE-TWO.</i>

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

               IT'S GOOD
               TO SEE YOU, TOO.

YEAH, WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING FOR YOU HERE.

         I NEED A PLACE TO STAY.

              <i> JUST FOR A COUPLE</i>
              <i> OF WEEKS.</i>

I CAN'T DO IT, VIAN.

   I JUST CAN'T.

WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED, I'M SORRY.

               IT'S JUST
               FOR A FEW WEEKS.

                I WON'T BE LONG.

 THEY LEFT THE HOUSE
 TO ME, YOU KNOW.

     IT'S IN MY NAME.

<i> HI!</i>

                     HI.

JIMMY, THIS IS, UH--
THIS IS YOUR UNCLE VIAN.

   HELLO. ARE YOU
   COMING IN?

NO, NO, NO.

HE'S JUST COMING BY
TO SAY HI.

           OKAY.

           MOM, I THINK
           HE WANTED TO COME IN.

DON'T YOU HAVE
SOME HOMEWORK

THAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING?

               I ALREADY DID IT.

                     VIAN!

  THANK YOU, GOD,
  FOR THIS FOOD

WE ARE ABOUT TO RECEIVE.

     AMEN.
               AMEN.

   HERE, SWEETIE.

             MM, THAT'S A REALLY
             GOOD MEATBALL.

YOU CAN STAY HERE
FOR TWO WEEKS.

IF YOU DRINK,
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

           I HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK
           FOR 12 YEARS.

                SINCE I WENT IN.

THAT'S GOOD.
GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

IT'S TOO BAD
IT TOOK WHAT IT DID

FOR YOU TO GET THAT.

                       THANKS.

            BROUGHT YOU
            A SLEEPING BAG.

   OH, THANKS.

          SO, I'VE GOT SOME WORK
          TO CATCH UP ON...

  SURE.

          SEE YOU IN A BIT.

HEY, UNCLE VIAN.

             HI, JIMMY.

I LOOKED YOU UP
ON THE INTERNET.

                 YEAH?

<i> YEAH. IT SAID</i>
<i> THAT YOUR RECORD WAS</i>
<i> 2 AND 7 AS A PRO.</i>

               YUP.

ARE YOU STILL GOING TO FIGHT,
NOW THAT YOU'RE OUT OF PRISON?

             I DON'T KNOW.

I THINK YOU'D DO
REALLY GOOD, UNCLE VI.

            THANKS, JIMMY.

I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO READING MY BOOK.

YOU LIKE TO READ?

          YEAH. YEAH, SOMETIMES.

OKAY. GOOD NIGHT.

             YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.

    HOW MANY PUSH-UPS
    IS THAT?

             A LOT.

    WELL, HOW MANY
    IS THAT?

             300.

    IS IT TRUE WHAT
    MY DAD SAID ABOUT YOU?

         WHAT DID HE SAY?

   THAT YOU WERE A PIMP
   AND A PUSHER.

         I DID SELL DRUGS ONCE,

            BUT I WAS NEVER
            A PIMP.

       IS IT TRUE THAT
       YOU KILLED A MAN?

                    YEAH.

         WHAT HAPPENED?

               I DON'T WANT
               TO TALK ABOUT IT.

                    <i> HEY.</i>

     <i> OH, HI.</i>

               <i> HI, HI. I WAS--</i>

          <i> I WAS TOLD TO SEE YOU</i>
          <i> ABOUT WORK.</i>

OKAY. UH, HAVE YOU
BEEN TO PRISON?

                    YEAH.

  OKAY, YEAH.
  UM, LOOK, MAN.

 I'M--
 I'M REALLY SORRY.

WE CAN'T HIRE EX-CONS.
IT'S, UH--

                     SURE.

IT'S AN INSURANCE
ISSUE.

                 YEAH, I KNOW.

   I'M REALLY--
                         NO.

OKAY. UH, I'M SORRY.

HEY. DON'T STOP RUNNING.

YOU WANT TO KICK?

JUST TRUST THE BALL
WILL BE THERE.

   BUT I HAVE TO STOP
   BEFORE I CATCH IT.

JUST KEEP RUNNING.
WHEN YOU TURN RIGHT,

TRUST THAT THE BALL WILL
BE THERE IN THE POCKET.

WHAT? WANT ME
TO CATCH IT FOR YOU?

                   SHUT UP.

                 HIKE IT AGAIN.

AND YOU SHOULD GO LEFT.

LOOK, JUST KEEP RUNNING, HUH?

KEEP RUNNING. OKAY, HIKE.

               YOU WANT ME
               TO THROW FOR YOU?

THAT WAS A GREAT CATCH!

      OKAY.

      AND...

<i> OH!</i>

             WHAT'S WRONG?

HAVING A HARD TIME
WITH MONEY, THAT'S ALL.

IT'S HARD...
BEING A SINGLE MOM.

                HEY, SORRY.

   IT'S OKAY.

 I KNOW THAT GOD
 WILL PROVIDE.

             YEAH, AND I'M GONNA
             WIN THE LOTTERY.

 YOU'RE PITIFUL.

  YOU KNOW THAT?
  PITIFUL.

<i> HEY, SWEETIE. I'M GONNA</i>
<i> GO TO THE MARKET.</i>

YEAH? YOU WANNA?

I DIDN'T MEAN WHAT I SAID
ABOUT THE LOTTERY.

                 THANKS.

   DOES IT MATTER?

            NO, NO. I JUST--

     AH. GOD, NO.

               WELL, I'M NOT--

            AH, I DON'T KNOW
            NOTHING ABOUT SIGNS.

THEN WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME?

             BECAUSE I THOUGHT
             IT WAS A GOOD LINE.

        YOU KNOW? I'M SO STUPID.
        IF I WASN'T STUPID,

          MAYBE IF I HAD GUESSED
          AT THE FIRST GUESS,

          THEN YOU WOULD'VE BEEN
          IMPRESSED BY ME.

           LOOK, CAN I HAVE YOUR
           PHONE NUMBER, MISS?

         NO.
                    NO? OKAY.

      NO. PUT THAT BACK, PLEASE.

HEY. I'VE BEEN LOCKED UP FOR
12 YEARS. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

          I EXPECT YOU NOT
          TO USE MY KID AS BAIT.

           I WAS HELPING HIM OUT
           WITH MY OWN VOLITION.

                WHAT? YEAH?

          WELL, I DON'T LIKE IT.

                   A BREAK, MOM.

  SHE'S THERE.

      SHE WANTS YOU
      TO GO AFTER HER.

WHAT IF SHE SAYS
NO AGAIN?

      YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT

     I DON'T MIND. I COULD
     PUT MY HANDS TO ANYTHING.

            COME BACK NEXT WEEK.

         YOU SURE YOU AIN'T
         GOT NOTHING?

                  DROP IT THERE,
                  GUYS.

        SURE, I'LL, UH--
        COME BACK. YEAH.

      QUIT THIS MORNING.

            HE WAS DOING
            TOO MUCH SPEED.

           YOU DON'T DO A LOT
           OF DRUGS, DO YOU?

      NO, NO.

              THAT'S GOOD.

           I'VE GOT A FEELING
           ABOUT YOU, YOU KNOW?

         MY INSTINCTS NEVER LIE.

      IF I GIVE YOU A JOB,
      YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING.

      YOU KNOW, YOU'D HAVE TO
      WAIT TABLES, WASH DISHES--

NO, I'LL SWEEP THE FLOORS,
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

    I DON'T MIND.

         OKAY. IT'S MINIMUM WAGE
         PLUS TIPS.

    THAT'S OKAY.

   ALL RIGHT. CAN YOU BE HERE
   TOMORROW MORNING AT 10:00 AM?

          SO, IT'S GOOD THAT YOU
          GOT A JOB, HUH, VI?

  YEAH. THANKS.

YOU THINK I COULD BORROW
THE CAR TOMORROW NIGHT?

         UH, WHAT FOR?
         WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO?

   I GOT A DATE.

          YOU CAN'T USE THE CAR.

WELL, IT WILL ONLY BE
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

           OKAY, JIMMY, CAN YOU
           GO TO YOUR ROOM,

          SO I CAN TALK
          TO YOUR UNCLE, PLEASE?

BUT I CAN JUST
STAY HERE AND LISTEN.

               GO TO YOUR ROOM.
               THANK YOU.

     I'M FEEDING YOU AND
     GIVING YOU A PLACE TO LIVE.

    I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH, VIAN.

     SURE. UH--

  BUT IT'S JUST
  A COUPLE OF HOURS.

                I JUST SAID NO.
                HOW MANY TIMES

            DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?

         OKAY!

IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

      WELL, OBVIOUSLY IT IS.
      OTHERWISE, YOU WOULDN'T BE

         ASKING ME OVER AND OVER
         AND OVER AGAIN.

      I MEAN, I DEPEND ON
      THAT CAR, VIAN, ALL RIGHT?

        I'M ABOUT A MONTH BEHIND
        ON MOST OF MY BILLS.

         DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
         WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR ME
         TO GET THROUGH THE DAY?

     I KINDA DO.

                    GOOD.

                       GREAT!

                      HI.

I BROUGHT YOU A PICTURE
OF GRANDPA SHERMAN.

THIS WAS TAKEN BY THE LAKE
THAT HE USED TO TAKE ME TO.

          HUH. YEAH, HE USED TO
          TAKE ME THERE, TOO.

WHY DO YOU THINK GOD
HAD GRANDMA AND GRANDPA
DIE IN A CAR CRASH?

          WHO TOLD YOU
          THAT GOD HAD THEM DIE?

MOM. SHE SAID THAT GOD
WILL NEVER TAKE ANYONE,

UNLESS IT WAS THEIR TIME.

                      YEAH.

        GOOD MORNING, BEAUTIFUL.

HELLO, WILLIAM.

         THESE ARE FOR YOU.

 THANK YOU FOR
 THE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS,

 BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP
 COMING BY LIKE THIS.

            OH, COME ON.
            DON'T YOU LIKE 'EM?

YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE ON.

     HOW COULD I MOVE ON
     WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME?

WILLIAM, WE BROKE UP
THREE MONTHS AGO.

YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
DOING THIS.

            COULD I HAVE A KISS?

    NO!

           SUDDENLY YOU'RE
           TOO GOOD TO KISS ME?

       LET ME GUESS.
       YOU'RE ALREADY HOOKING UP
       WITH SOME NEW GUY, HUH?

I'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK.

       COME ON. YOU CAN TELL ME.

    YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

           I COULD GIVE YOU
           A GOOD LIFE, SWEETIE.

GOOD-BYE, WILLIAM.

     AND THAT'S THE FLOUR. NOW,
     DON'T GET COCKY ABOUT THIS.

       ALWAYS MEASURE THE WATER.

    UH-HUH.

           THIS TAP WATER IS
           OUR SECRET INGREDIENT

            TO OUR GREAT-TASTING
            CRUST.

      WOW.

             SOME PEOPLE SAY
             IT'S THE OLD PIPES.

        MIGHT BE THE POWER PLANT
        DOWN THE ROAD,

       I DON'T KNOW. POUR IT IN.
       POUR IT IN THERE.

         ABSOLUTELY. FIRST TIME.

        THERE YOU GO! ALL RIGHT!

     AH. DID YOU REALLY DO
     A LOT OF COOKING IN PRISON?

         WHAT, NO? WHAT, YEAH,
         I WAS ONE OF THREE GUYS

             AROUND THE KITCHEN.
             YEAH.

  NOW, WHEN YOU WAIT
  ON CUSTOMERS,

YOU ALWAYS GOTTA TRY
TO HAVE A GOOD ATTITUDE.

I COULD DO EVERY JOB
HERE, OBVIOUSLY.

THE BEST WAY FOR YOU
TO LEARN REAL FAST

IS TO SHADOW ME, OBSERVE ME,
WATCH ME, OKAY?

                       SURE.

              LIKE, THERE'S ONLY
              US HERE.

HUH?

DON'T FOOL WITH ME, MAN.

                       I'M NOT!

ALL RIGHT, IT'S COOL.
IT'S COOL.

IT'S JUST A LOT OF GUYS
COME IN HERE,

AND THEY DON'T TAKE
THE JOB SERIOUSLY.

                       SURE.

BUT I KNOW YOU WILL.

              YEAH. HEY, LISTEN.

           IS THERE ANY WAY
           I CAN GET AN ADVANCE?

 YOU'VE GOT TO
 BE SHITTING ME, MAN.

           WELL, I'M LIVING
           WITH MY SISTER, AND--

         I'D ASK HER, BUT IT'S
         A LITTLE TENSE, AND I--

  YOU MET A GIRL.

                       YEAH!

         YEAH. HOW DID YOU KNOW?

DON'T FOOL WITH THE FOOLER!

I'M A PUSSY GANGSTER
FROM WAY BACK, MAN. COME ON.

ALL RIGHT. ONE TIME.
I'LL GIVE YOU AN ADVANCE.

PLEASE DON'T ASK AGAIN.
OKAY?

          AH, THANKS A LOT, MAN.

             ALL I NEED NOW
             IS A CAR. I MEAN,

            WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
            CATCH THE BUS

         AND MAKE UP A STORY I--
         THE CAR BROKE DOWN?

              I MEAN,
              WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

     I'D TRUST
     MY HIGHER POWER.

               HIGHER POWER.
               I HEARD ALL ABOUT

               THAT HIGHER POWER
               CRAP IN PRISON.

<i> ROLO!</i>

      HEY, BRO. WE GOTS TO ROLL,

          OR WE'LL BE LATE
          FOR THE MEETING.

JACK. HOW ARE YOU, BUDDY?
HEY, THIS IS VIAN.

HE JUST STARTED
WORKING FOR ME.

               HEY, MAN.
               NICE TO MEET YOU.

              HEY, YOU, TOO.

LISTEN, YOU THINK
YOU COULD HANDLE

THIS PLACE ON YOUR OWN
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR?

                      WHAT?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
                     <i> A MEETING!</i>

    WE'RE GONNA GO TO A MEETING,
    YEAH. I HATE PEOPLE

      WHO ARE LATE FOR MEETINGS,
      YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

      YOU'RE GOOD, RIGHT?

IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME
IF YOU WANT TO TELL HIM.

                 NO, NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T CARE.
SERIOUS. YOU KNOW THAT.

                YEAH, I GET IT.
                HE DOESN'T CARE.

          UH, MEN'S GROUP, LIKE,
          WE SIT AROUND, AND WE

        TALK ABOUT THINGS, AND--
        SEE YOU IN AN HOUR!

PEACE, BRO.

    HEY, HOW ABOUT THAT?
    WELL, NOTHING'S THERE.

  NO.
         NO? WAIT!

   HOLD ON A SECOND.
   THAT SEEMS--

            HEY, I'LL--
            I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

         MM, HEY.

         VI. LISTEN.

         JUST, UM...

         WHERE'D I PUT IT?
         HERE WE GO.

          GO AHEAD
          AND TAKE, UH--

          YOU CAN GO
          AND USE THE CAR.

                         OH.

            SHAME ON ME.

         YOU CAN'T PICK
         HER UP ON THE BUS.

                 WOW. THANK YOU.

                     THANKS.

          SURE.

HAVE A GOOD DATE, UNCLE VI.

                     I HOPE SO.

       YOU A LITTLE NERVOUS?

                      YEAH.

       YOU'VE BEEN LOCKED UP
       FOR A LONG TIME.

YOU'RE SOMETHING
                ELSE, JIMMY.

         CAN YOU TEACH ME
         HOW TO FIGHT?

                        NO.

              <i> THERE'S THIS, UM,</i>
              <i> GREAT PLACE</i>

        <i> JUST AROUND THE CORNER.</i>

SURE.

        AND IT'S SO NICE OUT.
        WHY DON'T WE JUST WALK?

YEAH? UH, YOU DON'T
WANT TO DRIVE?

        NO. IT'S JUST RIGHT
        HERE, UP THE STREET.

  OKAY.

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
EVENING.

            YEAH, IT IS.

            <i> THIS WINE IS GREAT.</i>

<i> OH, THAT'S GOOD. </i>
                YOU DON'T DRINK?

      NO.

        I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE

         YOU LIVE WITH YOUR
         SISTER AND YOUR NEPHEW.

YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

             SO, WHAT DO YOU DO?

   I'M A CHEF.

                        A CHEF!

YEAH. IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THAT?

           NO. NO, I THINK
           IT'S GREAT. I JUST--

       I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT
       YOU WERE IN CONSTRUCTION.

  MM. NOW YOU KNOW.

          YOU MUST MAKE
          GOOD MONEY DOING THAT.

      OH, YEAH.

            SO, WHAT SCHOOL
            DID YOU GO TO?

OH, HERE AND THERE.
YOU KNOW? LOCAL.

           IN CULINARY SCHOOL?

     WHAT?

               CULINARY SCHOOL.
               CHEF SCHOOL.

OH, YEAH, SURE.
SORRY. I, I THOUGHT

YOU SAID SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.

WHAT ABOUT YOU,
WHAT, WHAT DO YOU DO?

     ME? I AM A MORTGAGE BROKER.

        OH.

              YEAH. I KIND OF
              FELL INTO IT

              AND WAS REALLY
              GOOD AT IT.

       THEN THE COMPANY I WORKED
       FOR WENT BANKRUPT,

            SO I WAS DEVASTATED.

           UM, I DIDN'T THINK
           IT WOULD BE SOMETHING

         I LOVED DOING, BUT WHEN
         THE COMPANY WENT UNDER

             I ENDED UP GETTING
             A BETTER JOB OFFER.

             SO, IT ALL
             KIND OF WORKED OUT.

    YEAH.

        DID THEY MAKE A MISTAKE?

UH, NO, NO.
UH, NO, IT'S GOOD.

              WELL, THANK YOU
              FOR DINNER.

SURE. YOU'RE WELCOME.

              YOU HAVE TO COOK
              FOR ME ONE DAY.

YEAH.

               THAT WAS A REALLY
               GOOD PLACE.

IT WAS, YEAH.

I HAD A REALLY
GOOD TIME.

               YEAH. ME, TOO.

   THANK YOU.

                  SURE.

YOU ARE DANGEROUS.

            I COULD COME IN
            FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

ON THE FIRST DATE!

WELL, WHAT KIND OF WOMAN
DO YOU THINK I AM?

         ANYWHERE WHERE
         WE COULD WATCH SOME TV.

   I'VE HEARD
   THAT ONE BEFORE.

           YEAH? WELL, WE'LL
           LISTEN TO SOME MUSIC.

WELL, I'VE HEARD
THAT ONE, TOO.

                 COME ON.

           I WON'T TRY ANYTHING.

    THAT'S A LIE.

               HALF A LIE.

A LIE'S A LIE.

NO, I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY.

THERE IS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU.

              IS THAT GOOD?

        YEAH.

GOOD NIGHT, VIAN.

                 NIGHT.

                        BYE.

            CHECK THIS OUT.

       HEY. YOU MAKE THIS PIZZA?

     HUH? YEAH.

          IT'S NOT COOKED.

             WE WANT ANOTHER ONE
             THAT HAS HAM AND
             PINEAPPLE ON IT.

YOU GUYS ATE HALF OF IT.

YOU CAN SEE IT'S
COOKED ALL THE WAY.

       SO WHAT? IT'S NOT COOKED.

   I CAN'T DO IT.

        YOU JUST WORK HERE.

        THE HELL DIFFERENCE
        DOES IT MAKE TO YOU?

  IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

         NOW YOU KNOCKED IT
         ON THE GROUND.

         WHAT'S THE MATTER
         WITH YOU?

           HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON?

      CHUM BOY YOU GOT
      UNDERCOOKED OUR PIZZA.

            IS THAT TRUE?

  NO.
         WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

    IT FELL.

IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

           WE WANT A NEW ONE

           WITH HAM AND
           PINEAPPLE ON IT.

                 OKAY. I'LL MAKE
                 ANOTHER ONE.

               SEE THAT, DOG?

                THE CUSTOMER'S
                ALWAYS RIGHT.

                HEY, HOW'D IT GO
                LAST NIGHT?

  OH, IT WAS
  REALLY GOOD.

                  HUH. GET SOME?

  NO. IT WAS
  A FIRST DATE.

           YEAH. I'LL NEVER BE
           ABLE TO KEEP A WOMAN.

           I'M SERIOUS. AT FIRST
           IT'S ALWAYS GREAT,

            BUT THEN THEY ALWAYS
            END UP DUMPING ME.

THEN WHY DON'T YOU
DUMP THEM FIRST?

              I TRIED, BUT
              THEY CAN SENSE IT,

           AND THEN THEY GET ME.

                      HEY! HI!

                    HEY.

     WHAT'S GOING ON?

    MM.

            UM, IT'S A LOT WORSE
            THAN I THOUGHT.

OH, I'M SO SORRY.

              YEAH. IT'S OKAY.
              I DIDN'T COME

              TO BUM YOU OUT
              ABOUT MY DAD.

NO, I'M GLAD YOU CAME.
OH, THAT'S VIAN.

VIAN, UH,
THIS IS CHERRY.

                   HEY.

               HI.

HER DAD IS REALLY SICK.

                YEAH? SORRY.

YEAH. HEY, YOU WANNA STAY
AND HAVE SOME LUNCH?

             UH, NO. I WAS JUST
             DRIVING BY.

              GOTTA GO SELL
              MY JEWELRY.

 WHY?

          I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE,
          YOU KNOW.

THERE'S GOT TO BE
ANOTHER WAY.

            I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
            AROUND LATELY.

           IS THERE A NEW GIRL
           OR SOMETHING, OR...

NO, NO. WELL,
I'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT,

TRAINING HIM, BUT NO
OTHER GIRLS, YOU KNOW?

         SO, YOU THINK WE CAN
         HANG OUT OR SOMETHING?

YEAH. I'D LOVE
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

IT WOULD BE GREAT.
OH, DON'T CRY.

OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

          NO, IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW
          MY DAD'S SICK,

             AND I DON'T HAVE
             MONEY, SO...

OH... YOU KNOW WHAT?

YOU KNOW...

 YOU KNOW, I COULD...

I COULD GIVE YOU...

     600?

             YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T
             HAVE TO DO THAT.

I KNOW. I WANT TO.

I, I--
IT'S AN HONOR.

              ARE YOU SURE?

I'M 100% SURE.

                  OKAY.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TONIGHT?

               I DON'T KNOW.

LET'S GET TOGETHER.

              OH. YOU AND ME?

YES. 9:00.
                   OKAY.

9:00, CASEY'S, OKAY?
ME AND YOU.

                   OKAY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

           THANKS. OKAY, THANKS.

BYE NOW!

                  BYE.

       DON'T SAY A WORD!
       DON'T SAY A WORD.

   I WASN'T GOING TO.

       YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
       WE HAVE SOMETHING.

       WE'VE GOT SOMETHING
       GOING ON HERE, MAN.

        <i> THIS PLACE IS</i>
        <i> PRETTY COOL, HUH?</i>

 SURE.

         I'M GETTING THE CLUB
         SODA. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

        YES. CLUB SODA
        IS GOOD.

                TWO CLUB SODAS,
                JIMBO.

  ALL THOSE SCHOOLKIDS,
  YOU JUST--

   YOU JUST LET THEM
   ACT LIKE THAT?

          THE AFTER-SCHOOL CROWD

              IS A BIG PART
              OF OUR BUSINESS.

   WHAT, THEY DO THAT
   ALL THE TIME?

          NO, IT'S JUST
          A HAZING THING THEY DO

             TO NEW EMPLOYEES.

    WHAT'S HAZING?

        WELL, THEY GIVE YOU SHIT
        FOR A LITTLE BIT

         AND THEN THEY BACK OFF.

THAT KID IS OUT OF LINE.

          HIS FATHER IS THE D.A.

         SO?

             SO, YOU WANT TO GO
             BACK TO PRISON?

      AH. I SEE HOW IT IS.

    YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE
    IN A BAND.

YEAH? WHAT KIND
OF BAND?

    ROCK 'N ROLL, OBVIOUSLY.

       YEAH. YEAH,
       THAT WAS MY DREAM.

        NEVER THOUGHT I'D
        WIND UP MAKING PIZZAS.

   WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BAND?

         WELL, TURNS OUT
         I'M A LITTLE TONE DEAF,

       BUT WE STILL GOT A LOT
       OF AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES,

       WHICH I SCREWED UP 'CAUSE
       I WAS DRUNK ALL THE TIME.

          I REMEMBER ONCE WE HAD
          THIS SHOW IN TIJUANA,

         AND A LOT OF BIG PEOPLE
         CAME TO SEE US.

      I'M OUT IN THE PARKING LOT
      TAKING A LEAK, AND A COP--

          AND HE'S, LIKE,
          "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

         I'M LIKE,
         "I'M MAKING A COCKTAIL.

          YOU WANT ONE, SUCKER?"

          SO, THE GOOD COP BEATS
          THE CRAP OUT OF ME,

          TAKES ME TO JAIL. SO,
          I DO KNOW A LITTLE BIT

         ABOUT LIFE BEHIND BARS.

           SIX HOURS. BUT IT WAS
           A MEXICAN JAIL,

       SO THAT'S LIKE DOG YEARS.

      WOW.

              ALL RIGHT.
              YOU WANT TO BREAK?

  NO, YOU GO AHEAD.

                           COOL.

HEY, IT'S ME AGAIN.

 SHE STILL DOESN'T
 PICK IT UP.

            HAS SHE EVER
            STOOD YOU UP BEFORE?

       YES.

         WELL, SHE'S A STRIPPER.

             WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

  I KNOW, BUT...

YEAH, I WANT TO
BELIEVE IT BECAUSE...

              YOU REALLY THINK
              HER DADDY'S SICK?

   PROBABLY NOT.

THERE'S ANOTHER TIME
I FELL FOR HER BULLSHIT.

YOU KNOW, I...
I HAVE TO LET HER GO.

I KEEP THINKING IF I DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

 THEN SHE'S GOING
 TO CHANGE.

              A LEOPARD NEVER
              CHANGES ITS SPOTS.

           I GOTTA CATCH MY BUS.

I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE.

               SURE. LET'S GO.

  UH, HEY, WE ALREADY
  ATE DINNER, SO--

                 <i> HEY, I'M OKAY.</i>

    OH, THIS IS ROLAND.
    I WORK FOR HIM.

HEY. UH, BETHLEY.

             BETHLEY. WELL,
             THAT'S A COOL NAME.

THANKS FOR GIVING
MY BROTHER A JOB.

                    <i> YEAH, YEAH.</i>

              BEST GUY WE'VE HAD
              IN A LONG TIME.

           I MEAN, I'M GRATEFUL.

YEAH? YEAH, I'M GLAD
IT'S WORKING OUT.

                YEAH. IT'S GOING
                VERY WELL.

       OKAY. THANKS
       FOR THE LIFT.

         OKAY. BYE, AND I'LL
         SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

<i> YEAH!</i>

              I'LL SEE HIM
              IN THE MORNING.

          LOOKING, LOOKING GOOD.
          LOOKING...

       DRIVE SAFELY!

                      <i> ALRIGHTY!</i>

HI, JIMMY.

           I BROUGHT YOU A BOOK.

AH. "OLD MAN AND THE SEA."

              YEAH. IT'S ONE
              OF MY FAVORITES.

      THANKS.

                GRANDPA SHERMAN
                GAVE IT TO ME.

     YEAH?

 WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

              THIS OLD MAN
              AND A KID IN CUBA.

      YEAH?

WHAT HAPPENS?

              THEY GO FISHING.

               GRANDPA SHERMAN
               GAVE IT TO ME

           AFTER WE WENT FISHING
           AT THE LAKE.

YEAH,
AND WHAT HAPPENS?

               YOU HAVE
               TO READ THE BOOK.

        OH.

SURE, I'LL READ IT.

IF YOU SAY IT'S GOOD,
I'LL READ IT.

             HOW'S YOUR NEW JOB?

OH, IT'S NOT BAD.
NOT BAD.

              IS YOUR BOSS COOL?

      YEAH.

                  THAT'S GOOD.

            YOU KNOW, SCIENTISTS
            HAVE JUST DISCOVERED

            A STAR THAT ORBITS
            AROUND A BLACK HOLE,

          AND THAT STAR MOVES IT

               OVER 6,000 MILES
               A SECOND.

YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE,
JIMMY.

                         OH.

        HEY, SWEETIE.

                AN EMERGENCY,

           IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT
           HE HAD TO GO TO.

                CAN I HELP YOU?

UH, NO. NO,

 SURE, I GET IT.

          SO, IS THAT THE PLACE
          YOU'RE A CHEF AT?

 YEAH. YEAH,
 THAT'S THE PLACE.

 I DON'T KNOW,
 IT'S A LITTLE...

I KNOW IT'S NOT ALL
THAT FANCY, YOU KNOW.

           I LIKE IT.

      NAH.

OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

                   WHAT?

I'VE NEVER HAD A MAN
MAKE ME BREAKFAST BEFORE.

                HUH? WELL, GOOD.

AND I'M VERY HAPPY

YOU STOPPED BY
LAST NIGHT.

                  YEAH. ME, TOO.

            OH, SHOOT. I'M LATE.

             LISTEN, UH--
             YOU GO BACK TO BED,

              AND I'LL BRING YOU
              BREAKFAST.

IF YOU'RE LATE, TAKE OFF.

                     OKAY.

             I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
             ENJOY.

               THANK YOU.

     SORRY.

               YEAH.

            HEARD THAT BEFORE,
            VIAN.

             SOUNDS LIKE
             YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF
             A REAL GIRLFRIEND.

             IS THAT YOUR FIRST
             POON SINCE PRISON?

YOU'VE BEEN BANGING
STRIPPERS FOR TOO LONG.

COME ON,
           MR. SENSITIVE.

I REALLY LIKE HER.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK

ABOUT HER LIKE SOME
DUMB PIECE OF ASS.

             YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.
             I'M SORRY.

YEAH. LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, RO.

YOU EVER THINK ABOUT
MAKING THIS PLACE

A LITTLE NICER,
MAYBE FIXING IT UP?

YOU KNOW,
RAISING THE PRICES?

GET A LITTLE
DELIVERY SERVICE GOING?

               WOW. LISTEN
               TO THE JAILBIRD

            SOUNDING LIKE A REAL
            ENTREPRENEUR.

              GET A LITTLE TASTE
              OF THE GOOD LIFE,

        AND SUDDENLY THE WORLD'S
        ALL SHINY AND BRIGHT.

  SCREW YOU.

           BUDDY, I LOVE THE WAY
           YOU'RE THINKING,

             BUT YOU'RE LIKE ME.
             YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT

               TO THINK BIG
               TO BE BIG, RIGHT?

   YEAH. SURE.

       JUST KEEP DOING IT, MAN.
       GIVE ME SOME MORE IDEAS.

             I'M GOING TO WRITE
             IT DOWN.

OKAY.

           HEY! WHO DOES A GUY
           HAVE TO KNOW

           TO GET SOME SERVICE
           AROUND HERE?

DON'T TALK
LIKE THAT IN HERE.

             SORRY, NEW GUY.
             SHALL I HAVE A WORD
             WITH MY FATHER

          AND GET THE DEPARTMENT
          OF HEALTH DOWN HERE
          FOR A LITTLE VISIT?

   HEY, LET'S
   TRY THIS AGAIN.

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
THIS AFTERNOON, HUH?

        UM, TWO CHICKEN PARM
        SANDWICHES.

RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A SEAT?

   I'LL BRING IT
   RIGHT OVER.

                THAT WAS GOOD.

   OH, YEAH. YEAH.

      HEY, LITTLE JIMMY.

               GOT ANY NEW BOOKS
               FOR US?

      LEAVE ME ALONE, LEE.

            OH, THAT'S ON WAY
            TO TALK TO A FRIEND.

            I NEED TO BORROW
            SOME MONEY.

              DO YOU HEAR
              WHAT I SAY, BITCH?

    I CAN'T HELP YOU.

         LET'S TAKE A LOOK
         AT THE LITTLE BACKPACK,

                SHOULD WE?

OW!

         WHAT ARE YOU
         LOOKING AT?

         I'LL KICK
         YOUR ASS, TOO!

THAT IS SO COOL.

           UH-HUH. YEAH,
           THAT WOULD BE NICE.

           JUST HAVE SOME DINNER
           AND JUST HANG OUT.

YEAH. MAKES ME FEEL
REAL GOOD

THAT YOUR SISTER
INVITED ME, YOU KNOW?

                      YEAH.

HEY, I WONDER
IF I COULD BRING CHERRY.

              YOU'RE NOT STILL
              SEEING HER.

NO, BUT THIS MIGHT BE
A WAY FOR US TO GET BACK
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

               IS THIS A JOKE?

I KNOW.
I'M VERY LONELY.

                       WELL...

HEY...
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK

ABOUT BECOMING BUSINESS
PARTNERS WITH ME?

               WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

WELL, THE OLD GUY
THAT OWNS THIS PLACE,

HE LOVES ME, BUT HE'S
GOING TO BE SELLING SOON.

HE SAID IF I CAME UP
WITH 30 GRAND

FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT,
HE WILL CARRY THE NOTE.

I'VE ALREADY SAVED 15 GRAND,
SO ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO

IS COME UP WITH 15 GRAND,
WE'RE BUSINESS PARTNERS.

WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

          HEY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE
          A CAR. WHERE THE FREAK

              AM I GOING TO GET
              15 LARGE, HUH?

I DON'T KNOW...
                       JEEZ.

FAMILY OR FRIENDS?
I DON'T KNOW.

                        YEAH.

THE PROBLEM IS,
WHOEVER BUYS THIS PLACE

IS PROBABLY
GOING TO FIRE US.

                       YEAH?

 YEAH.

         SHOOT. MAYBE I SHOULD
         GO AND STICK UP A BANK.

SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
I WOULD'VE DONE

 BACK IN THE DAY.

                     NO KIDDING.

YEAH. I GOT PRETTY BADASS
BEFORE I QUIT DRINKING.

                        WOW.

YEAH, IT'S CRAZY.
LITTLE METHAMPHETAMINE.

YEAH. MY SISTER WAS A DEALER,
SO I GOT IT FOR FREE.

HEY! YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS
OPEN FOR BUSINESS?

                YEAH. WHAT
                WOULD YOU LIKE?

I'D LIKE A LARGE
WITH EXTRA PEPPERONI

AND EXTRA CHEESE.

                   SURE.

               THAT'S 16.67.

 ALL RIGHT.

I FORGOT MY WALLET.
CAN I GET YOU TOMORROW?

    COME ON, LEE.

    YOU KNOW WE DON'T
    DO THAT FOR ANYBODY.

           OH, NO. I, I'LL
           TAKE HIS WORD FOR IT.

  BUT IF HE STIFFS US--

                 HE'S NOT GOING
                 TO STIFF US.

        OKAY.

  THANK YOU.

           SURE. YOU'RE WELCOME.

                     YES!

<i> WHAT ABOUT ME?</i>
<i> CAN I PLAY?</i>

            ALL RIGHT. UH, OKAY.
            YOU'RE THE FIRST.

              YOU'RE THE SECOND.

    YOU'RE GONNA
    GET ME IN TROUBLE.

MOM, CAN I HAVE
SOME MORE CAKE?

       OH, HONEY, NO, NO, NO.
       SUGAR'S GOING TO KEEP YOU
       UP ALL NIGHT.

     BETHLEY, THANK YOU
     SO MUCH FOR DINNER.

  I CAN'T EVEN TOUCH DESSERT.

               I KNOW. I HAVEN'T
               BEEN INVITED

         TO A HOME-COOKED DINNER
         IN A LONG TIME.

     NO? THEN YOU'RE GONNA
     JUST HAVE TO COME OVER

MORE OFTEN FOR DINNER, ROLAND.

       HEY, YOU MIND IF
       I CHANGE THE MUSIC?

                 SURE, GO AHEAD.

                   ALL RIGHT.

OH, YOUR SISTER'S GREAT!

                    YEAH.

    HOW LONG HAVE YOU
    LIVED WITH HER?

                OH, NOT LONG.

           I LIVE IN THE GARAGE.

    OH, YOU CONVERTED
    THE GARAGE?

                HUH. SORT OF.

                 COME ON,
                 I'LL SHOW YOU.

               WOW!

<i> YEAH. TAKE A SEAT.</i>

        YOU, UH, YOU'RE
        QUITE THE DANCER.

             AH, YEAH. I USED TO
             DANCE A LOT.

              NOT SO MUCH
              ANYMORE, YOU KNOW.

YOU KNOW, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO GET GOING.

                     WHAT?

               WELL, THE PARTY'S
               JUST STARTED.

I KNOW. I KNOW.
I'VE GOT TO GET UP EARLY.

            IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

I HAVE A CARDIO CLASS
AT 8:00 A.M.

                 WELL, SKIP IT.

                 SKIP IT ONCE.
                 YOU'LL BE FINE.

I WISH I COULD.

BUT WE'LL TALK
TOMORROW, YEAH?

                     SURE.

     ALL RIGHT.

                   OKAY.

     GOOD NIGHT.

                 UH, GOOD NIGHT.

                   GOOD MORNING.

MORNING, JIMMY.

                ME AND MOM ARE
                GOING TO CHURCH.

                DO YOU WANT
                TO COME WITH US?

AIN'T NOTHING FOR ME
THERE.

             IF MOM WILL LET ME,

              WILL YOU TAKE ME
              TO THE LAKE LATER?

 SURE, I WILL.

HOW'S THE LAKE?

IS IT STILL THE SAME?

             YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

GRANDPA SHERM USED TO
TAKE ME HERE ALL THE TIME.

HE SAID IT WAS MAGIC.

HE PUT SOMETHING SPECIAL
UNDER THE ROCK HERE.

               IT SURE IS GOOD
               TO HAVE A FRIEND.

DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY FRIENDS AT SCHOOL?

         NO. I DON'T HAVE THAT
         MANY FRIENDS AT SCHOOL.

             THAT'S WHY I'M SO
             GLAD YOU SHOWED UP.

         IT SURE IS GOOD TO HAVE
         A FRIEND IN LIFE.

  YEAH. I'M GLAD
  WE'RE FRIENDS.

              DID YOU EVER THINK
              THERE'S SOMETHING

           BIGGER THAN
           THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD?

      I DON'T KNOW.
      LIKE THE UNIVERSE?

               LIKE, IT'S SO BIG
               AND AMAZING,

          BUT NO ONE CAN SEE IT,

            AND JUST EVERYWHERE.

COME ON.

                  GO FOR A PASS.

   HOW DID YOU
   FIND THIS OUT?

                I HAVE PEOPLE.

  HE WAS IN PRISON?

                 KILLED A GUY.

        WHAT?

           SECOND-DEGREE MURDER.

       BEAT A GUY TO DEATH.
       SPENT 12 YEARS IN PRISON.

                JUST LOOKING OUT
                FOR YOU, JO.

               THIS IS AN EX-CON
               MURDERER.

              HE SHOULD AT LEAST
              HAVE THE DECENCY

          TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

 I WANT YOU TO GO.

             YOU DON'T WANT
             TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

     JUST GO.

                  BABY, LISTEN--

DON'T TOUCH ME. JUST GO.

           HEY, I THINK I'VE GOT
           SOME BAD NEWS.

             WHAT?

       I THINK THE OLD MAN FOUND
       A BUYER FOR THIS PLACE.

  <i> YEAH?</i>

         YEAH. WERE YOU ABLE TO
         COME UP WITH ANY MONEY?

HEY, I TOLD YOU, I DON'T
HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY.

               WELL, HE'S
               GOING TO SELL IT.

WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

                MAYBE GET A JOB
                AT ONE OF THOSE

                FAST FOOD PLACES
                OUT BY THE MALL.

YOU THINK THEY'LL HIRE ME?

                  PROBABLY.

            HEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL
            WITH YOUR SISTER?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

              I MEAN, SHE SEEMS
              REALLY COOL.

HEY, YOU KEEP AWAY
FROM HER.

WHAT THE F IS SO FUNNY?

             I ASSUME
             WE'RE ADULTS HERE.

SHE'S NOT FOR YOU.

            A LITTLE JUDGMENTAL,
            COMING FROM YOU.

HEY, YOU GO OUT
WITH BIMBO STRIPPERS.

SHE'S A GOOD WOMAN,
OKAY?

SHE HAS A SON.

HER HUSBAND RAN OFF
WITH SOME SKANKPOT.

WON'T EVEN PAY CHILD SUPPORT.

               AND YOU PUT ME
               IN THAT CATEGORY?

  NO.

       WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK
       ABOUT THIS ANYMORE, OKAY?

         I ONLY BROUGHT IT UP
         OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOU.

GOOD. SO NOW YOU KNOW.

                    <i> YEAH, I DO.</i>

KEEP THE F AWAY FROM HER.

             OR WHAT, YOU'RE
             GONNA KICK MY ASS?

YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

         IS THAT A THREAT, VIAN?
         ARE YOU THREATENING ME
         RIGHT NOW?

BACK OFF, ROLAND.

          YOU KNOW WHAT?
          MAYBE I MISJUDGED YOU.

   MAYBE WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER.

   YEAH? WHAT?

YOU'RE GONNA FIRE ME?

JUST BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO OFF
WITH MY SISTER?

         YOU USED TO BE THE BOSS
         IN PRISON, I'M SURE,

         BUT YOU'RE NOT
         THE FREAKING BOSS HERE!

                    I AM!

HEY, FORGET YOU, ROLAND.

I DON'T NEED THIS SHAM.

           THAT'S GOOD,
           BECAUSE YOU'RE FIRED!

YEAH? SCREW YOU!

                SCREW YOU!

     SCREW YOU!

YEAH, I'M JUST
DOWN THE STREET.

    YEAH.

I COULD COME OVER
AND SAY HI.

YEAH? THAT'S COOL.

SURE. I'LL BE THERE
IN TEN MINUTES.

 YEAH. BYE.

               <i> WHAT'S GOING ON?</i>

NOTHING. I'M JUST
GETTING READY FOR WORK.

                WHAT'S WRONG?

I, UM... I DON'T THINK
THIS IS WORKING.

              WE JUST STARTED
              SEEING EACH OTHER.

   IT'S NOT YOU.

              <i> WHAT IS IT, THEN?</i>

 I JUST CAN'T
 DO THIS ANYMORE.

I'M MESSED UP, AND
I SHOULDN'T BE SEEING
ANYONE RIGHT NOW.

              BUT WHAT DID I DO?

NOTHING. NOTHING.
I'M JUST...

 I'M IN A BAD PLACE,

AND I NEVER SHOULD'VE
GONE OUT WITH YOU

IN THE FIRST PLACE,
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

              THERE'S SOMETHING
              GOING ON,

          AND YOU DON'T WANT
          TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS.

         SO, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

                CAN I HELP YOU?

           YEAH.

               WHAT DO YOU NEED?

           I, UH...

        AH, NOTHING.

               YOU'RE AN ABACUS?

     I DO! I HAVE A STONE
     IN THE NECK. OH, MY GOSH.

                   <i> HEY, VI.</i>
                           <i> HEY!</i>

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

         HAVING A CUP OF COFFEE.

   GET OUT OF HERE.

                    NO, COME ON.

         YOU KNOW WHAT?
         I TRIED TO TALK TO YOU,

            BE STRAIGHT ABOUT
            LIKING YOUR SISTER--

GET THE HELL OUT OF HER!

                <i> HEY! HEY! VIAN,</i>
                <i> THAT'S ENOUGH.</i>

          WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

                  MAYBE YOU NEED
                  TO GO, OKAY?

            YOU GET OUT OF HERE,
            ALL RIGHT?

   THIS IS MY HOUSE, OKAY?
   YOU DON'T EVEN PAY RENT HERE.

                YEAH, ALL RIGHT?
                YOU DON'T KNOW
                WHAT IT'S LIKE.

           YOU DON'T KNOW
           WHAT MY LIFE IS LIKE,

         WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH,
         WHAT IT'S LIKE

            TO RAISE A KID ON
            MY OWN WITH NO HELP!

    SHUT UP.

         WHERE WERE YOU, HUH?
         SO YOU DON'T GET TO SAY

         ANYTHING ABOUT HOW I DO
         THINGS. DO YOU GET IT?

             YOU LOST THAT RIGHT
             A LONG TIME AGO!

                YEAH! OH, YEAH,
                THAT'S GREAT.

                JUST LEAVE!

     DON'T EVEN DEAL WITH IT
     'CAUSE IT'S WORKED OUT

     SO WELL FOR YOU
     YOUR WHOLE LIFE!

         UNCLE VI, I BROUGHT YOU
         A CUP OF COFFEE.

        HEY, JIMMY.

        THANKS.

     MM. IT'S NOT BAD.
     DID YOU MAKE IT?

                   YEAH.

            YOU EVER READ
            THE BOOK I GAVE YOU?

ABOUT THE OLD MAN?

              YEAH, "THE OLD MAN
              AND THE SEA."

  NO, I HAVEN'T
  STARTED IT YET.

         I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT,
         ESPECIALLY THE END.

    YEAH.

                 WHAT'S WRONG?

    OH, I JUST WANT
    TO BE SOMEONE,

    MAKE SOMETHING
    OF MY LIFE.

 THOUGHT I COULD BE
 A FIGHTER, BUT,

I DON'T KNOW. JUST...

IT PRETTY MUCH SEEMS
I'VE AMOUNTED TO NOTHING.

   JUST SOME...

  BROKEN DOWN GUY
  LIVING IN A GARAGE.

     BUT UNCLE VI, YOU'RE
     THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD.

 YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
 JUST A KID.

WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW?

        HEY, GO GET US
        A TABLE, WOULD YA?

               WHAT DO YOU WANT?

           I WANT A LARGE
           EXTRA CHEESE

           WITH SAUSAGE
           AND MUSHROOM.

        HEY, WHERE'S VIAN?

                 HE DOESN'T WORK
                 HERE ANYMORE.

              WHY?

                    HE MOVED ON.

   HE'S THE BEST GUY
   YOU EVER HAD!

        WELL, HE DOESN'T WORK
        HERE ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

                       SIT DOWN.

           WHAT, UH-- WHAT
           DO THE TESTS SAY?

THERE'S SLIGHT
HEMORRHAGING
ON THE BRAIN.

                 OH, NO.

THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL
IN BRAIN TRAUMA.

           UM, WHEN WILL HE
           COME OUT OF THE COMA?

WELL, THAT I CAN'T
TELL YOU EXACTLY.

              DAYS? ARE WE
              TALKING WEEKS?

ONLY TIME CAN TELL.

               OUR FATHER
               WHO ART IN HEAVEN

           HALLOWED BE THY NAME.

            THY KINGDOM COME,
            THY WILL BE DONE

  ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.

      GIVE US THIS DAY...

                  OH, JIMMY.

               JIMMY, I LOVE YOU
               SO MUCH.

          WHAT TIME IS IT?

                   I DON'T KNOW.

                <i> SOMETIME</i>
                <i> IN THE MORNING.</i>

  OH. I'VE GOT TO CALL WORK
  AND TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED.

         I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

                         SURE.

THIS IS A HOSPITAL?

                  HEY, JIMMY.

I WAS DREAMING AND
IN THE SPECIAL PLACE.

EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.

THE LAKE...
AND THE ROCK!

THE ROCK IS RIGHT THERE
FOR YOU AND MY MOM!

                     SURE.

I SURE COULD GO
FOR SOMETHING TO EAT.

DO YOU WANT TO EAT
WITH ME?

                   SURE.

              ANYTHING YOU WANT.

 PEOPLE CAN BE
 SO SILLY,

 ALL TRAPPED UP
 IN THEIR MINDS,

AND FISHES JUST KEEP
SWIMMING, AND GRASSHOPPERS

ARE TALKING NICE,
VERY NICE.

HEY!

SWEETHEART!

       I KEPT TRYING TO TELL YOU
       I WAS OKAY, MOM.

    YOU DID. YES, YOU DID.

      BUT I HAVE TO GO HOME NOW.

     YES! OF COURSE,
     I'M GOING TO TAKE--

  I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME.
  BABY, I LOVE YOU.

  I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

           I LOVE YOU, TOO, MOM.

            LOVE IS REALLY GOOD.

        OH...

     BABY? JIMMY?

JIMMY? NO, NO, NO, NO.

JIMMY? JIMMY, COME BACK.
COME ON, HONEY.

COME ON, SWEETHEART.
COME BACK. VIAN--

               GO GET SOMEBODY.
               GET THE DOCTOR.

               WE NEED A DOCTOR,
               PLEASE!

HEY. COME ON, BABY.
COME ON.

COME ON, SWEETHEART,
WAKE BACK UP.

                    I, I DON'T
                    UNDERSTAND.

      A SURGE. IT'S NOT
      COMMON, BUT IT DOES HAPPEN
      WITH PEOPLE IN A COMA.

     A SUDDEN SURGE OF ENERGY,

         A BRIEF MOMENT
         OF CONSCIOUSNESS,

    AND THEN THEY LAPSE BACK
    INTO THEIR COMA STATE.

             BUT WHY, AND WHY
             FOR JUST A MINUTE--

IT'S NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD.

                 IT DOESN'T MAKE
                 ANY SENSE.

                   YOU OKAY?

              NO.

         I'M NOT OKAY.

I'M GONNA GO INSIDE AND...

   TAKE A SHOWER
   AND THEN GO BACK.

               I'LL GO WITH YOU.

      DEAR GOD,
      I WANT TO SAY A PRAYER

    THAT YOU WATCH OVER JIMMY

    AND THE REST OF MY FAMILY.

  I KNOW THAT, WHATEVER HAPPENS,
  IT'S YOUR WILL,

     AND I HAVE TO TRUST THAT.

  AND ALTHOUGH I FEEL ALONE,
  I KNOW THAT YOU'RE THERE, GOD.

            I DON'T...

     I JUST DON'T KNOW
     IF I'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

       I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.
       I DON'T KNOW HOW.

                  HELLO?

                   YES.

                  YEAH.

               VIAN? VIAN!

HE'S GONE!

               HE'S GONE.

                  AH.

        OH, MAN. THAT'S GOOD.

                    HI!

SIS!

                    OOH.

WE HAD A DEAL YOU COULD
STAY HERE IF YOU DIDN'T DRINK.

                THAT'S OKAY.

  YOU NEED TO GO, VIAN.

            WHERE AM I GONNA GO?

HUH?

   I NEED YOU TO LEAVE.

           IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

        IT'S NO BIG DEAL AT ALL.

                   COME ON.

DON'T. DON'T COME NEAR ME!

                WHY ARE YOU
                SO UPTIGHT? HEY!

              MY FREAKING SIS--
              MY SISTER, HUH?

            AH, WHERE AM I GONNA
            GO, HUH?

         I GOTTA FIND SOMETHING.

DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO DRINK?

      I HAVE SOMEONE COMING OVER
      IN A FEW MINUTES.

 YOU HAVE A NEW GUY
 ALREADY? WOW.

THAT DIDN'T TAKE
BUT A HOT SECOND

FOR SOME OTHER SUCKER
TO START GIVING YOU
THE HARD ONE.

               YOU KNOW WHAT?
               YOU'RE DRUNK,

             AND I THINK
             YOU SHOULD GET OUT.

I NEED A PLACE TO STAY
FOR THE NIGHT.

  CAN I STAY HERE
  FOR THE NIGHT?

                       NO.

   OH, COME ON.

               DO YOU HAVE
               ANY SELF-RESPECT?

HEY, WHA-- YOU KNOW,
I DON'T NEED YOU.

 I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT.

YOU KNOW, I'D COME
OVER HERE THINKING

MAYBE, MAYBE WE HAD
SOMETHING GOING.

AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE DON'T.

WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
GOING, DO WE?

                 NO, WE DON'T.

I DON'T NEED YOU.

IF YOU WANTED
TO BE BACK WITH ME,

 I WOULDN'T EVEN WANT
 TO BE WITH YOU.

YOU, YOU JERK MY CHAIN

AND ACT LIKE
YOU'RE INTO ME.

  WHAT A JOKE.

YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO DRINK?

                 NO. GET OUT.

 DON'T YOU CALL ME.

YOU DON'T CALL ME NO MORE.

I'M DONE WITH YOU.

ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE CLOSING AT 10:00,
SO START WRAPPING IT UP!

  WHAT THE HELL?

 WHAT THE FREAK
 YOU'RE DOING, VI?

LEAVE ME ALONE.

         LEAVE YOU ALONE?
YES.

         ARE YOU STUPID
         OR SOMETHING?

       I TOLD YOU NOT
       TO FREAKING COME HERE,

          NOW GET YOUR STUFF
          AND GET OUT!

            SCREW YOU.

HEY, MAN! WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

               GET OFF OF ME!

                 <i> YEAH, HIT HIM!</i>

                 <i> HIT HIM AGAIN!</i>

          ALL RIGHT. THAT'S
          ENOUGH, THAT'S ENOUGH.

               COME ON! COME ON!

      DON'T BRING YOUR FOOT
      BACK IN HERE!

          SCREW HIM, MAN!

   DID YOU SPEAK TO THE COPS?

                  <i> CHARGING YOU</i>
                  <i> WITH FELONY</i>

          <i> AND ASSAULT</i>
          <i> WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.</i>

             YEAH.

    GUESS I'LL BE GOING AWAY
    FOR A LONG WHILE.

   THAT'S OKAY.

 YOU GUYS CAN LEAVE.

   JIMMY'S FUNERAL
   IS TODAY.

    I WISH I COULD MAKE IT.

YEAH, I KNOW YOU'LL
BE THERE IN SPIRIT.

         HEY, VIAN. YOU KNOW
         THOSE MEETINGS I GO TO?

   YEAH?

         WELL, I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

               I'VE BEEN SOBER
               18 YEARS, AND--

 STUFF YOUR MEETINGS
 UP YOUR FRICKING ASS.

I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO SEE MY SISTER!

      LET'S GO.

              HEY, UNCLE VI.

      JIMMY?

               IT'S OKAY.

 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 IS THIS A DREAM?

           I CAME TO TELL YOU
           THAT'S IT'S ALL OKAY,

             AND EVERYTHING
             IS PERFECT.

BUT YOU'RE NOT ALIVE.

                 I'M RIGHT HERE.

                I TALKED TO YOUR
                MOM AND DAD.

                THEY SAY
                THEY LOVE YOU.

              GRANDPA SHERM,
              HE SAYS HE'S SORRY

               THAT HE BEAT YOU.

YEAH? WELL,
IF HE'S SO SORRY,

HOW COME
HE NEVER TOLD ME?

            HE DID. HE WROTE YOU
            IN PRISON,

                WHEN YOU WERE
                TOO MAD AT HIM,

                THAT YOU DIDN'T
                OPEN HIS LETTER.

HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

                   I KNOW.

I'M SORRY FOR
WHAT I SAID ABOUT YOU,

ABOUT YOU
JUST BEING A KID.

             IT'S OKAY.
             I KNOW YOU LOVE ME.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

              I HAD A FEW THINGS
              TO TELL YOU.

   MAN...

  I'M SO HAPPY
  TO SEE YOU...

EVEN IF THIS IS SOME
KINDA WEIRD DREAM.

            MY MOM, SHE NEEDS
            YOUR LOVE RIGHT NOW.

I'M GOING BACK TO PRISON.
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

        JUST TRUST THAT YOU CAN.

TRUST THAT I CAN DO WHAT?

               THAT YOU CAN DO
               ANYTHING.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, JIMMY?

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

               JUST TRUST THAT
               IT WILL BE THERE.

TRUST WHAT WILL BE WHERE?

   I'LL SEE YOU LATER, UNCLE VI.

         YOU HAVE BEEN
         RELEASED.

                      BY WHO?

       I DON'T KNOW.
       THE WATCH COMMANDER

       WANTED ME
       TO RELEASE YOU.

                WHAT'S GOING ON?
                WHO GOT ME OUT?

      LEE. REMEMBER
      THE LITTLE PUNK

    THAT USED TO GIVE YOU
    A HARD TIME?

    HE CAME IN FOR A PIZZA
    AND ASKED ABOUT YOU.

       I TOLD HIM
       WHAT HAPPENED.

  HE SEEMED UPSET, SAID
  HE WAS GOING TO TALK

     TO HIS OLD MAN,
     THE D.A.

     HE GOT YOU OUT.

 ALL RIGHT? LET'S GO!

                    YEAH.

I'LL BE OUT IN THE CAR.

                    OKAY.

                   HI THERE.

               I'M TRULY SORRY.

               I'M SORRY
               FOR EVERYTHING.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING.

               I HAD NO RIGHT...

          TO TELL YOU TO STOP
          GOING OUT WITH ROLAND.

    YEAH.

YEAH, YOU DIDN'T.

  SO, UM...

WHAT, WHAT'S, UH...

 WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

          I'M GOING TO GO TO
          THE MEETINGS WITH HIM.

 THAT'S GOOD.

               YEAH.

YOU KNOW, I'M GIVING HIM
ANOTHER CHANCE.

        I CAN LEAVE IF YOU WANT.

WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, GONNA LIVE IN--

           I'LL STAY WITH--

  IN A SHELTER?

            OH, I'LL STAY
            WITH ROLAND.

          I CAN STAY WITH HIM.

HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM.

            THAT'S GREAT.

     YEAH.

           DID YOU SAY YES?

YEAH, I DIDN'T HAVE
AN ANSWER.

IT'S SO SOON, YOU KNOW,
AND THIS WAS BEFORE--

     JIMMY.

          WELL, HE'LL BE LUCKY
          TO HAVE YOU.

OKAY, WHAT'S WITH YOU?

 WHY THE SUDDEN
 CHANGE OF HEART?

           IF I TOLD YOU, YOU
           WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

                DO WHAT?

I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN LIVE--

I DON'T KNOW, VI.
IT JUST...

YOU KNOW, JUST...

 IT JUST KILLS ME,
 YOU KNOW?

I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO. I DON'T KNOW

HOW TO KEEP GOING,
YOU KNOW?

LIKE ROLAND,
HE DRIVES YOU OUT,

BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

I CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN.

FEELS LIKE MY SKIN IS BEING
RIPPED OFF MY BODY.

            HEY, COME HERE.

             I LOVE YOU,

            AND I WILL DO
            ANYTHING FOR YOU.

     THANK YOU.

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU,

BUT I KNOW IT'S GOOD.

THAT MAY BE THE ONLY LIGHT
I HAVE RIGHT NOW.

                  THE ROCK.

HE PUT SOMETHING SPECIAL
UNDER THE ROCK HERE.

          WHAT'S UNDER THE ROCK?

THE ROCK, IT'S RIGHT THERE
FOR YOU AND MY MOM.

                THIS IS BULL!

              ONE MORE TRY.

                 WOW.

NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE
TAKE THE MONEY?

               NO, I DON'T WANT
               YOUR BLOOD MONEY.

   JIMMY LEFT IT
   FOR YOU!

             VIAN, TELL ME WHERE
             YOU GOT THE MONEY.

  I TOLD YOU.
  JIMMY CAME TO ME,

  LIKE, IN A DREAM
  BUT MORE REAL.

 HE SAID OUR FATHER,
 SHERM,

SHERM LEFT IT FOR HIM.

YOU KNOW DAD,
HE NEVER TRUSTED BANKS.

             I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
             GOING ON WITH YOU,

             BUT I DON'T WANT
             YOUR MONEY.

IT'S OUR MONEY.
IT WAS JIMMY'S MONEY,

AND JIMMY LEFT IT FOR US.

               I DON'T BELIEVE
               THAT STORY,

               AND YOU SHOULD BE
               DISGUSTED

           THAT YOU MADE THAT UP
           ABOUT JIMMY.

I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S TRUE.

NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE
TAKE THE MONEY?

               NO, I WON'T,
               AND I DON'T WANT

               TO TALK ABOUT IT
               ANYMORE.

                SO, WHAT'S
                SO IMPORTANT,

            YOU COULDN'T TELL ME
            OVER THE PHONE?

I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR COMING OVER HERE DRUNK.

IT WAS DISRESPECTFUL,
AND I'M SORRY.

                   GREAT.

                 IS THAT IT?

     YEAH.

  I MEAN...

I REALLY LIKE YOU,
AND...

I JUST WANTED TO
TELL YOU THIS IN PERSON.

              I REALLY LIKE YOU,
              TOO, VIAN.

         I JUST DON'T THINK
         WE SHOULD DATE ANYMORE.

               I THINK WE'RE
               REALLY DIFFERENT,

              AND I DON'T SEE
              HOW IT WOULD WORK.

       OH.

      OKAY.

WELL, THANKS FOR
SEEING ME IN PERSON.

               YEAH, OF COURSE.

<i> HI.</i>

             WE'RE NOT OPEN YET.

THIS PLACE STILL FOR SALE?

                 I FIRED YOU.

I KNOW, AND I DESERVED
TO BE FIRED. I--

I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR BEING A CREEP

ABOUT YOU AND MY SISTER.

IT'S JUST I REALLY LOVE HER,
AND I THINK SHE LOVES YOU,

AND I THINK IF SHE HAS YOU
GOING TO CHURCH, WELL--

       WHAT'S WRONG WITH CHURCH?

WELL, NOTHING. NOTH--
NOTHING'S WRONG WITH CHURCH.

         THEY GAVE OUT FREE
         SNOW CONES LAST SUNDAY.

    OH.

I WANT TO GO TO
A.A. MEETINGS WITH YOU.

                   GOOD.

              WE'VE BEEN SAVING
              A SEAT FOR YOU.

HERE'S MY 15,000.

  WE'RE PARTNERS.

                   YEAH.

              WE'RE PARTNERS.

       YEAH?

                          <i> YEAH.</i>

     HEY!

     HOW WAS CHURCH?

                   IT WAS GREAT.

          I PRAYED IN CHURCH
          ABOUT YOUR STORY,

       ABOUT JIMMY IN THE DREAM.
       I BELIEVE YOU.

   MY NAME IS VIAN MCLEAN...

        AND I'M THE MAN
      WHO KILLED YOUR SON.

       AND I'M HERE TODAY
  TO TELL YOU THAT I'M SORRY,

     AND I WILL DO ANYTHING
      THAT YOU ASK OF ME.

      I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR YOU.
