Also in the news, at
the California-Nevada border...

the grisly discovery
of 19-year-old Danny Phillips...

found dismembered
this morning...

in the trunk
of an abandoned car...

some seventeen miles south
of Lake Tahoe...

where police say...

they are withholding
certain grisly details.

The big news, of course...

is still that robbery
out of Las Vegas...

where police report an estimated
one million dollars in cash...

was stolen from a casino there.

The money
was reported missing...

approximately 2:00 a.m.
yesterday morning...

along with a small briefcase...

Excuse me:
It was being transported in.

Excuse me:

Alberto Bertoli,
owner of the casino...

Looking for a hank belt.

There an interstate around here?

Sixty miles. You'll see it
when you get there.

...just picked it up
and walked away.

Where the hell am l, anyway?

On Capitol Hill...

the president's health bill
came under attack again.

White House sources say
the heat will continue...

until a referendum
can be reached.

Excuse me.

What's going on?

What'd you say?

What's the trouble?

Me and my wife
was driving along...

and we came across
that Chrysler over there.

So, what's the fuss?

Let the sheriff tell him
if he wants to, Manny.

You shouldn't be saying
anything.

Mr. Winneman...

what we'd like you to do is have
you go with Trooper Lee...

down to the station
and give us a statement.

Then we can send you
on your way.

OK.

Where you coming from?

Traveling through to San Diego.

From where?

Carson City.

Well, I got a strong
piece of advice for you.

Keep going, straight through.

At least until
you get to the interstate.

Don't stop to make
any new friends.

How's that?

We got a homicide
in the trunk of that car.

You don't even want
to think about it.

Yeah.

** Who's that I hear **

** Whisperin' in my ear? **

** Sugar, look who's here **

** Your old loverboy **

** Who's that I see **

** Sneakin' up on me? **

** Sweet misery **

** My old loverboy **

** If you knew him like I do **

** You wouldn't look at him
twice **

** Heartbreaker by nature **

** A warm embrace,
but a heart of ice **

** So, that is why **

** Just pass on by **

** That devil smile **

** Of my old loverboy **

** Don't be a part **

** Of his trail
of broken hearts **

** Stop before you start **

** With my old loverboy **

** My old loverboy **

** My old loverboy **

** Oh, boy **

Thank you.

Pardon me.

Oh, God.

You're not too neighborly,
are you?

I said...

you're not too neighborly,
are you?

I beg your pardon?

You got a kink about watching
people fry in the desert?

Hey, look...

I didn't see you out there,
and when I did, it was too late.

I'm sorry. How the hell
did you get out there, anyway?

Look, let me buy you lunch.

I mean it.
It's the least I can do.

I look like a goddamn used tire.

It's on me,
so have whatever you want.

I don't know your name.

Adrian... your friend for life.

How the hell did you get dumped
in the middle of nowhere?

A fella in a big rig picked me
up about where you passed me.

But he got a little too devoted,
you know what I mean?

So, you got out?

Looks that way.

You a fag?

I don't mean any offense
if you are.

I mean,
if it weren't for homos...

none of us fellas
would ever get a ride.

I've thumbed enough miles
to know that.

Is that right?

Yeah.

A fella in a fancy suit
must have a name.

Jack.

You know, Jack, I can usually
tell in about two minutes...

all I need to know
about a person.

Like what?

Like, is he a loser?
Does he shoot dope?

Does he like to wear
ladies' underwear?

Are you telling me
you're a psychic...

or that you like to look
at people's pants?

You're a funny guy, Jack.

Here you go. Coffee, iced tea.

Do me a favor, would you?

If one of you boys
stole that million dollars...

leave me a big, fat tip,
all right?

What million dollars is that?

That case of money
from the Vegas casino.

He could be passing
right through here.

Is that right?

Deputy says so.

Says if he's smart,
he's headed for the airport...

with his head on a swivel.

A swivel? Why is that?

Got away
with all that mob money.

Ooh.

Not much a person wouldn't do
for a million dollars, huh?

I wouldn't know...

but I'd like to hear
more from you about that.

You ready to order?

What do you think about that,
Jack?

Hear what, uh, Patsy here says
she'd do for a million dollars.

Anything.

I didn't say that.

Did... did I misunderstand
what's being said, Jack?

You ready to order,
you let me know.

I love a woman
who can take orders.

You know what? I could have
your ass thrown out of here.

Jingle bells, anything you want
to do on my ass is fine with me.

Aw, come on, now, jingle bells.

What are you doing?

You got a problem with
the way I handle myself, Jack?

No. I just want to know what
the hell you think you're doing.

You got something
to be nervous about?

I just like to lay
all my cards on the table.

I told you once, Jack.

I can tell about people.

Now, what you got in there, huh?

Papers from the front office?

Executive memos...

you're Ioyally carrying
across the state line?

I don't think so.

Now...

you just sit tight a minute
while I go right a wrong.

...warn that the killing is
extremely similar in design...

to the discovery
of a ninteen-year-old male...

found dismembered yesterday
south of the state line.

Officials are not willing yet
to comment...

on the possibility
of serial killings.

Speaking of the state line...

the theft of what is now
estimated to be...

close to one and a quarter
million dollars in cash...

from the Pot O' Gold Casino
in Las Vegas...

continues to make headlines.

Reports confirm
the money was in a briefcase...

that was left momentarily un...

Join the picnic, sir.

You're kidding me.

Tanker jackknifed
five miles up the interstate.

The junction is closed off
for clean up.

What is it, for criminy's sake,
plutonium?

It's going to be a while.
There's a chemical spill.

You know what's behind you.

There's food and lodging
in Watson.

I just came from there, yeah.

That's all you got
within fifty miles...

or you can join the block party.

Hey, hey, hey: Hey:

I'm in the armpit of the world.

What am I supposed
to sound like?

It's a hundred degrees...

and I've been driving
in circles for two days.

I am tense, for criminy's sake.

What do you think
old craphead is going to say...

when I don't show up
for that meeting?

Well, he is a craphead, Mommy.

You think he needs another
reason to look the other way...

when the regional manager job
comes up?

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Look, I might still stop
at the cabin.

I don't know. I don't know.

All right? L... I'm really tired.

I want to lay down. Yeah. Yeah.

Uhh...

Hey, man, I wouldn't stay here.
Check that shit out.

God.

Jack?

This a bad time, Jack?

I brought you something.

What?

Jack.

I figured you'd be long gone
by now.

Must've lost your appetite
in a big hurry, huh?

I'd hate to think
it's because...

you didn't like me, Jack.

I mean, you can see...

what an unfriendly place
the world can be.

What are you doing?

Tch.
I got no place to sleep, Jack.

You're crazy.

I'll tell on you, Jack.

I'll tell everybody
what you got in that briefcase.

Don't worry.

I'm a man
with a secret or two myself.

Like I said...

I brought you something.

Is that front door locked, Jack?

Deadbolt, too.

Hey, you don't have to leave.

Keep me company.

What the hell is that?

It goes by many names.

That stuff is disgusting.

You put enough of that in you...

and you're going
to goddamn fall apart.

You know all about it,
don't you, Jack?

Yeah, people scream evil
like a motherfucker...

unless it's their own...

then it's cool.

Do you know
what they would do...

if they found you in here
with that?

I would lose everything...
my house, my car, my job.

Your briefcase.

You know, Jack...

there are two places
they send people...

for having too good a time...

one is church,
the other's prison.

I've done time in both, Jack.

Enough time
to know true boredom.

And boredom is its own kind
of misery, now, isn't it, Jack?

And boredom is why
we look for that thrill.

And when we find it, we take it.

And while we're wondering...

whether to piss on ourselves
or laugh...

Ohh...

Ohh. We're getting off.

Hey, Jack...

I read you.

I read you, man.

Repression is a dangerous thing.

It's deadly.

Ohh...

God.

God.

Yes. Yes.

Car trouble?

Tch. Try it again, Jack.

Sounds bad, Jack.

OK, try it again.

Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk,
tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

Ooh.

Tch.

How long since
you had your plugs cleaned?

How long since you had plugs?

You don't get it, do you, Jack?

I got your license number...

and I got the best damned
eyewitness description...

of you on this highway.

So, the first time I see...

these taillights
taking off down the road...

priority one, Jackie boy...

is an anonymous call
to the nearest state trooper.

You don't think I'd do it?

Try me.

Get out of the goddamn car.

** Feel so down **

** I said you're driving
much too fast **

** Living in this town **

** Has made you
so heavy on the gas **

** Just be calm, you said **

** I always... **

You a married man, Jack?

Come on, man.

I'll show you mine,
you show me yours.

I got a family
like everybody else.

You know...

I bet nothing you do
is like everybody else, Jack.

What line of work you in?

I sell paper products.

What, like, plates?
Paper plates?

Straws and shit?

Huh.

What's a fella in paper products
take home, anyway?

I'm not going to say to you.

Careful, now.

Don't bust your ass climbing up
to that higher moral ground.

What do you think I am, Jack?

The devil?

What are you, anyway?

Just some angel who got a little
tarnished around the wings?

Uhh.

No, no, no, honey. I'm not
trying to sound mysterious.

I'm just still in the middle
of gosh darn nowhere.

Yep. Yep.
I've done nothing this time out.

No.

Uh, my credit card's
over the limit.

That's right.
I'm selling nothing.

E-mail is putting us right
out of business, floppy disk.

It's... it's just
driving me crazy, too.

Well, I...

Yeah, well, yeah.

About those sprinklers, you
know, you just put on the water.

Go out back there
until I come home.

I'll figure it all out
with you, OK?

There a problem?

This your car?
Nah.

Then it's not your problem.
Uh-huh.

Yep.

Massachusetts.

Yeah. Just... we left Boston
three weeks ago.

Boston.

Yeah, I got to go to Brazil...

to check out the rain forests
before they cut it all down.

That's my girlfriend Dahlia.

Hi. Excuse me.
I'm going to bust.

Hi. I'm Adrian.
My friends call me Dusty.

Dusty,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

Wait, wait.
Hold on a sec. Hold on.

You got a water hose
you needs to replace.

That's a brand-new company car.

You're the boss.

I got to hang up.
I've got to go, honey. Bye.

Hey, you been keeping
your ear to the radio?

There's some kind of a nut
running around...

cutting people up
in itsy bitsy pieces.

You heard about it?

What are you telling me?

Where'd you find that thing?

According to the radio,
this ain't the best time...

to be filling out
your dance card...

if you know
what I'm talking about.

I just had those hoses replaced.

Just telling you what I heard.

Now, you want
that hose or not?

No.

Jackie boy. Now, here's some
people who know how to travel.

This is Gerald
and his very fine lady Dahlia.

They're out seeing this country
the only way there is to see it.

This is Jack the man.
We have to go.

What?

We're late.
We got to make up for lost time.

Hey, Jack,
what are you talking about?

I thought maybe we could get
something to eat with them.

I mean, you are a little
hungry, aren't you, Jack?

No. What's it come to?

41.70.

We're not that late, Jack.

We're not that late, Jack.
Keep the change.

Jack...

Catch you later.
All right.

Yeah. Nice to see you.
See you later, Dusty.

She's a cutie pie.
Yeah, yeah.

Yeah. Ahem.

Honey?
Yeah.

You think they're lovers?
No, baby.

Ha ha ha:

What the hell are you doing?

Talk to me, Jack.

We don't look right together,
get it?

What?

Everyone
within a hundred miles...

knows about the Hatchet Man
and the goddamn money.

Do you understand?

What'd that guy
say to you back there?

What, do you think
I'm some dumb ass old man...

that you can drag around
on your psycho circle jerk?

Jack, I was looking to do
a little business, all right?

Gerald and Dahlia
got a traveling pharmacy...

in that old van,
and I want some.

Yeah? That's too bad, because
if you want to go with me...

you might as well throw
that syringe out the window.

My rig
don't fly out the window, Jack.

Get out of my car.

Don't hurt my feelings, Jack.

Get out of my car:
Get out: Get out:

Get out:
Get out, God damn it: Get out:

You feel better now, Jack?

If we're going to do this,
we're going to do this my way.

You get that?
I got it.

Drive on, Jackie boy.

Shut up. Don't talk.

Ahh.

You got parts?
Mm-hmm.

Some.

Yep.
Looks like your water hose.

Yeah.

Come on back.
OK.

Harliss:
We got people coming in:

My husband.

That's Woolly, our tarantula.

He poisonous?

Not one bit. They just look it.

Ooh, sweet Jesus.

This is Victor, our boa.

He's a big old boa.

Yow.

Wow. What about this fella?

That's our gila... gila monster.

He poisonous?
Well, yeah.

Digestive tract is so slow
the waste backs up inside them.

Makes their venom toxic.

So, what are you
telling me there, Harliss...

he's so full of shit
he's poisonous?

Sinks his teeth into you,
they don't let go.

They're like vice grips.

That's just to make sure...

their venom
gets into your bloodstream.

Here. Keep the change.

Thanks.

Miss me?

Come on, Jack.

Let's head on down
that long Ionesome highway.

Hey, Jack...

you ever hear the phrase
"dead man walking"?

They use it in prison.
You know what it means?

On death row...

whenever any of the boys
get escorted anywhere...

the guards all yell,
"Dead man walking:"

Every gun in the joint
gets cocked... chunk-chunk...

everyone stops
what they're doing...

they grab a piece of the wall,
and they let the man pass.

You know why?

'Cause he could
slit your throat...

and all they could do
is shoot him.

And so what? He's already dead.

Well, that's me, Jack.

That's how I feel all the time.

Oh, yeah. This is for you.

It's a souvenir...

from the Creepy Crawly Zoo.

You gotta respect
who I am, Jack...

what I bring
to this little relationship.

See, I'm crazy, Jack.

I am the dead man walking.

You're an idiot.

You sound spooked there, Jack.

Doesn't Jack sound spooked?

Get rid of it.

You are not seeing
my position here.

Now, speed up.
You're slowing down.

I said speed up, Jack.

Jack, give it the gas.

Uhh:

I want you to know, Jack...

I am one dangerous,
crazy motherfucker.

Ohh:

Uhh.

I want to know
you respect me, Jack.

That's all.

Oh.

OK, Jack?

OK... Jack?

Huh.

You've got to go...

and I don't want to see you
around here again.

Don't play me, Jack.

You know what I am,
and I know what you are.

That ain't never gonna change.

Now get us out of here
before you kill the both of us.

Ha ha ha ha:

Let's go, Jack.

Ahh.

Hey...

I'm tired.

I want to eat, then go to sleep.

Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Jack, get with the program.

And tonight, the program is fun.

Oh, man.
Jackie boy, look at that.

Fun, fun, fun tonight.

No.
What?

You can't.
We've already been seen...

with them a bit
too much already.

Jack, there ain't even
a prairie dog awake out here.

What's wrong with you?
I'm getting back in the car.

Why are you trying so hard
to convince yourself...

that you're having
such a bad time?

Listen, I don't care at all
what you do with those people.

Jack...

Ahem.

Don't do it, Adrian.

Please don't do this.

Please don't do this.

We're partying, Jack.
You got that?

Mm. We're partying.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So, the thing is, I drop.

I mean, I crash to the floor
like a heap, right?

I still got the goddamn needle
stuck in my arm...

but the thing is... the topper...

I am dead.

I'm talkin' really dead.

They're taking my pulse,
but nothing's there.

They call an ambulance,
and two paramedics later...

I am on my way
to the county hospital...

to get a tag on my toe...

when I sit up...

and ask for a Snickers bar.

No: Ha ha:
Oh, get out: Ha ha:

Get out: Ha ha ha ha:

Yeah, I'm telling you.
See, I had done so much shit...

I shocked my system so badly...

that my vital signs,
they dropped to nothing...

put me in a coma.

Now, what makes you want
to go to the edge like that?

Oh, I thought you knew,
baby doll.

The edge...

is where it's at.

So, how much of, uh...
this and that other...

have you got, exactly?

How much we got's a lot.

You traveling
with that kind of money?

Might be.

What about your partner?

What about him?

He makes me nervous.

Nah, don't worry about Jack.

He's just strange.

I'm gonna go for a walk.

She likes you, man.

What are you tellin' me,
Brother Gerry?

I'm sayin' that, uh...

Dahlia...
she's her own woman, you know?

She, uh...

she does what she wants.

And you got nothing to say
about it?

Uh-uh.
We don't do that, you know?

So...

what do youse do?

You want to go to the edge
with Dahlia?

Then you got to do it her way.

And, uh, what way is that?

It's the more, the merrier,
you know?

I don't like Gerald doing it,
either.

Really.

Not the heroin, I mean.

It's just a high
he can't reach anymore.

Then why let him try?

I don't know.

I don't tell him what to do.

You have a purple aura.

It's purple and yellow.

l... I can see it change.

That's the conflict.

I'm not joking.

There's...
some kind of terrible trouble.

Well, that's how Gerald and I
decided that we were family...

'cause we both had
the same aura.

You don't know what a family is.

How could you do the things
you do and be a family?

Heh. I don't know what you mean.

I mean, get away from me.

You take Gerald,
and you get the hell away.

Fuck. Whew.

Gerry? Gerry?

We're leaving.

We're leaving right now.

Get me out of here.

Come here.

We are so.

What do you think you're doing?

What do you think
you are doing, Jack?

I'm dead.
I'm going back to the motel.

Bullshit.
You tried to scare her.

You're trying to scare them
both away, you asshole.

This is it, Adrian.
This is what, Jack?

We're done.
We're not done.

We're just starting.

You think this is coincidence,
our paths crossing like this?

We attracted each other.
We were like magnets, Jack.

The two of us
colliding in time...

bound together
by our little secrets.

You think this is coincidence?

I'm going back to my motel room.

I want you to come with me.

I think you're a liar, Jack.

I think you want to party.

You're just afraid
you might like it.

You be careful now.

You be real careful
this is what you want to do.

Adrian, listen to me.

Let's just get out of here now.

You think you can take me, Jack?

Come on with it.
This is wrong.

You want to get bloody with me,
Jack?

Come on with it.
This is a mistake.

You made the mistake.

Putting your hands on me
like that was a mistake.

You think you know
right from wrong?

You think you know what that is?

You got as much right
to moralize...

as Jack the fucking Ripper.

Adrian.

Get in the van:
What?

Now:
Adrian:

Oh, my God:
Get in the van:

Now:

Adrian:

Shh.

It's OK, it's OK.

It's OK.

Adrian.

Go back to the motel, Jack.

We have to talk.

Go away, Jack.
You're scaring these kids.

I want you to come with me.

Adrian.

Catch up with you later, Jack.

Adrian, don't do this.

Adrian.

We need to talk:

No, we don't.

Mmm.

Adrian.

Decided to join the party,
Jackie boy?

Close the door, Gerry.

Close it and lock it.

Jack.

Aw, Jack.

Ahh.

Tch. It was beautiful.

I thought about you, Jack.

Could you feel it?

Jack...

Christ almighty.

Mmm.

What you trying to do
to yourself?

I'm going to take a shower,
so we can get out of here.

You're right, you know.

We should not hang around.

Hey, Jackie boy, why...

why don't you go to the van?

Huh?

You know you want to.

You OK, little buddy?

What the hell is this?

We can't just keep
wandering down the highway.

They find that van, and they're
going to come looking for us.

Aw, bullshit, Jack. Nobody
saw us with them last night.

I don't know that they didn't,
either.

You got a death wish?
Maybe you do. I don't know.

I have no intention
of being questioned...

at some police checkpoint.

You want to, go ahead.

This your place?

Inherited it.

Wanted to sell it.

Then Carol and I stayed out
here, fell in love with it.

There's a kitchen, bedrooms...

bathroom.

Our own little fortress.

What, is this it?

That's all we'll need.
To get into trouble out here...

you have to come screaming
and begging for it.

You were already coming here...

weren't you, Jack?

Even before I showed up.

I'm going
to turn the water on...

and light the pilot
for the heater.

You turn the radio on.

Dealer takes one.

Ahem.

Ahem.

I'm in for two thousand more...

and I'll raise you...

ten thousand.

OK. Here's the two.

Ten...

and I raise you twenty.

I'll see your twenty...

and I'll raise you...

Unh.

Fifteen.

You really are dumb, aren't you?

Well, we'll just have
to see now, won't we?

Your call.

Flush, Jack.

Ow.

Pair of deuces... oops...

and we three kings.

You piece of dog shit.

You're right.

I really should've run into you
a long time ago.

Ah-um. Ahem.

You wouldn't be cheating,
now, would you, Jack?

That's
a hundred thousand dollars.

And you have lost...

a quarter of a million dollars.

Now, how are you going
to pay that back?

Life's a bitch,
and then there's you, huh, Jack?

Get that shit away from me.

Time to dip into the Gerald
and Dahlia memorial drug fund.

Oh, you're just
a slow-motion suicide.

Ahem.

If you want to kill yourself...

why don't you
just get it over with...

instead of waiting
for somebody else to do it?

You think I don't know
how I got here, Jack?

Well, you don't look
like a junkie.

Then what do I look like,
Jack...

Mr. Everything Comes Easy...

Mr. Football Star...

Mr. Class President?

You could look like a prince
and still be white trash.

You make me sick.

You got a problem with me, Jack?

You got the problem, kiddo.

Have another drink, Jack.

How many CCs of that nitro
you do every day anyway, huh?

A hundred? Two hundred?

Shit.

You think I'm the stupid one,
Jack?

Put that needle in your arm.

I don't think you know
a goddamn thing.

I've lived in places
you wouldn't shit in, Jack.

I've done time with men...

who'd off themselves
and the whole world with them...

like they're doing
everybody a favor.

And you know what I know, Jack?
What I know from that?

Man is just a thing.

He eats, he sleeps, he fucks.

And all the rest
is just passing time.

Now, how much
of those things he does...

depends on how big
that hole is inside him.

You know the hole
I'm talking about, Jack?

That one.

It rips open inside everyone...

when they suck in
their first screaming breath.

It's why babies scream, Jack.

We think
it's a demon inside us...

the great white whale,
the prince of darkness...

but it's not, Jack.

It's just a big empty hole.

And I see men try
to fill it with women...

with other men...

with the good book...
thank you, Jesus...

with money, power...

and everything
you can think of on the planet.

And you know
what finally separates...

the men from the boys,
Jackie boy?

The wisdom...
the knowledge of the ages.

You know what it is, Jack?

That hole... it can't be filled.

We pretend, because
no one's got the balls...

to live with the truth...

the truth being
that inside that hole, Jack...

is what we really are...
nothingness.

Just a need, Jack...

the truth that we ain't any more
noble than we are knowable.

And every dark place in us...

every rabid fucking impulse
we have...

is just the nature of the beast.

Now, if you can live with that,
do it...

or else sit back,
have another shot...

and let me do the same.

Ohh.

Ohh. Ahh.

Unh.

You want
a little lesson in life?

Just for you, kiddo.

The monkey doesn't shit
where the crocodile sleeps.

You're the one
with the needle in his arm...

Iooking for a new daddy, right?

What's he supposed
to come along and do?

Finish
what the first one started?

Well, here he is.

Father knows best.

It goes by many names...

crank...

crack...

croak.

Uhh.

I bet you there's not even
a name for this.

But you can think of one...

on your last trip
to Never Never Land.

Maybe, by rights, you should
end up in little pieces.

Maybe that's all
you really want.

I don't know.

I'm not a shrink.

But this is exactly
how you should go out.

Don't you think?

You can make this
as messy as you want...

but if I were you,
I'd hold still.

It's just a shot, little boy.

In a second,
you won't feel a thing.

Please don't kill me, Jack.
Please don't kill me, Jack.

Off to see the wizard.

Unh. Uhh. Uhh.

Unh:

Unh.

Unh:

Unh:

Jack. Thought that was you.

For Christ's sake.

You know, I couldn't
for the world of me...

figure out who the hell
would be knocking out here.

Heh heh heh.
Put a scare into you, did I?

Well, folks
down at the market...

saw you drive through
this afternoon.

How's Carol?

Not on this trip, no.
Oh, really?

Well, listen, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

Little David...
he's my new deputy.

You remember Greg Brewer,
deputy sheriff...

big guy, about 6'2"?

Well, this is his son David.

David, this is Jack,
good fishing buddy.

The sheriff's
always looking out...

for this place.
Don't you worry.

I try.
Appreciate it.

Yeah, well, that's one
of the reasons I went on by.

Jack...

we got to talk.

Sure.

Now, hold on a minute.
Busy night.

Now, listen, you been hearing...

all that hatchet killer crap
on the radio?

A little bit, yeah.

Well, he could be out this way.

Paul and I go way back.

The sheriff's going to be on
vacation for the next 3 weeks.

I just want you to know
I take my job very seriously.

No one likes to talk about it...

but these places are so isolated
they're pretty easy targets...

for squatters, burglars,
what have you.

You see?

Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

Now, apparently, this nutso
could be just about anywhere.

I mean, they tell me
they've got...

troopers and feds
crawling all over the place.

You be glad
you don't have Carol...

out there with you tonight,
Jack.

Well, I'm going
on vacation next week.

Let me tell you
what I'm going to have...

little David do here for you.

Now, we usually
check these places out...

about this time,
just after dark.

You see, I figure
the little squatter problem...

...sometime after dark.

How long you going to be here?

About until tomorrow.

Uh...

the old Kingsley place...

three miles off,
there's an old junction...

on the old Jones Road.

Yeah, well, about...
about three months ago...

Was it three months already?
How long ago was it, David?

March. Mid-march.

March?
Was it that far back? Jesus.

Four months ago.
I guess it was four months ago.

Seemed like yesterday
was what it was.

Well, anyway,
David was out on patrol...

The house on the left side.

Damnedest thing he ever saw.

Thought it was
an apparition or something.

You know, well,
it turned out...

She's a bottom feeder.
She's MTV, you know?

Out of a light gene pool
or something, for Christ's sake.

You know the type?

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

Yeah, get that, will you, David?

Anyway...

people end up doing
the weirdest damn things, Jack.

I can't tell you.

My job...

gets weirder every day.

It's Charlie Juarez's.

Oh.

Old Charlie's specialty
is domestic disturbances.

You see what I'm talking about?
I mean, it never stops.

Come on, little David.
Got a big night of work ahead.

Oh, Jack...

say hello to Carol.

I look forward
to seeing the both of you...

The next time you come up.
Right.

Hey, Jack...

you better lock up everything
before you turn in tonight.

I don't believe in the Bogeyman,
but he might be out tonight.

We'll see you, Jack.

That's two, Jack.

That's all you got.

You can't kill the devil, Jack.

You ought to know that.

You know,
you really are a sick man, Jack.

Here I am...

the one single body...

on the face
of this shit-eating planet...

who would accept you...

for what you really are.

And you try to kill...

and bury me.

You going to tell me
why you do it, Jack?

I've been dying to ask.

You tell me why...

and I'll tell you...

how I walked off
with all that money...

from the Pot O' Gold Casino.

People spend
their whole lives...

thinking that someone
is going to come along...

and take away all their misery.

For a precious few...

I am that someone.

I like that.

Every boy needs a hobby.

Didn't want to do me,
did you, Jack?

I just have one little question
for you, Jack.

Why do you cut them up
into little pieces?

Why do you do that?

For the fuck of it.

Uhh:

In other news, the body count
has risen to six...

in the brutal string
of serial killings...

along the rural highways
of both Nevada and California.

The killer, who even police
and federal investigators...

are now tagging
the Hatchet Man...

may have claimed
his fourth and fifth victims.

Two bodies found in a van...

with Massachusetts
license plates...

are thought to be his latest.

Authorities are doing
everything they can...

but are suggesting
that at this point in time...

hitchhiking
or ride sharing in the area...

What happened to your eye?
It's just a scratch.

Hey, Mr. Powell.

Ooh.

Say, hey, Billy.
