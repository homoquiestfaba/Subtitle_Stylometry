>> TODAY ALONE, I GOT 17 PHONE
CALLS FROM MY LOCAL RESIDENTS

CLAIMING THAT THEY HAVE
LYME DISEASE.

>> WELL, FRANKLY,
UP UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO,

UNTIL 1975,

THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY HAD NO
IDEA WHAT LYME DISEASE EVEN WAS.

ALL WE KNEW WAS THAT IT CAUSED
PSYCHIATRIC DISTURBANCES

AND SEVERE
NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS.

>> EVEN SO, IT SEEMS
THAT OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS,

THIS DISEASE HAS BECOME
NO LESS DEBILITATING,

ESPECIALLY HERE
IN THE TRI-STATE SUBURBAN AREA.

>> I ASSURE YOU
THAT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY

IS VERY CLOSE TO DEVELOPING
A TREATMENT FOR LYME DISEASE

BECAUSE WE NOW KNOW THE SOURCE.

>> THE TICK, RIGHT?

>> WELL, TECHNICALLY,
THE INFECTION STEMS

FROM THE BLOOD OF THE DEER.

THE TICK IS JUST
THE TRANSMITTER.

>> WELL, IN ANY CASE,
WHAT PRECAUTIONS

SHOULD PEOPLE BE TAKING?

>> [sighs]

OKAY, LET'S HAVE 'EM.

>> GIVE ME LIBERTY
OR GIVE ME DEATH.

>> HEY, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

THE LAST THING WE NEED
IS FOR HIM TO GET SICK.

HE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE NEXT DOOR

IN ALL THOSE WEEDS
WITHOUT THE TAPE.

>> YOU NEED A HAIRCUT.

>> OH, SORRY, MICK,
ALL GONE.

>> TICKS, I CAN HANDLE.

BUT YOU,
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

>> [giggles]

>> * YOU *

* YOU WITH A TICK
IN YOUR HAIR *

>> I'LL BE OUTSIDE.

>> HEY, DON'T GO FAR.

YOU'RE PARANOID.

>> I'M SORRY, MICK.

I JUST--YOU KNOW,
I HAVE THIS BAD FEELING

IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH.

>> IT'S A TRADITION.

BESIDES, YOU KNOW
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME
WITH HIM LATELY.

>> YEAH, WELL,
HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

>> [whispering]
WE DON'T ACTUALLY KILL ANYTHING.

I EVEN STARTED USING BLANKS
LIKE YOU ASKED ME TO.

>> LISTEN, MICK,
IT'S JUST DANGEROUS NOW, OKAY?

LOOK AT CHARLIE.

>> CHARLIE?

I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF WE FOUND OUT

THIS WHOLE THING
WAS PSYCHOSOMATIC.

OKAY, LET'S JUST FORGET
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE THE ONE
THAT LETS HIM DOWN.

[rocks crunching]

>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

STILL WITH
THAT STUPID QUARTER TRICK?

>> NO.

>> YOU KNOW, THEY SAY NO MATTER
WHERE YOU ARE ON LONG ISLAND,

YOU CAN ALWAYS HEAR THE TRAIN.

CAN'T GET FAR ENOUGH AWAY.

>> YEAH, I HEARD THAT.

>> NO, YOU DIDN'T.

I JUST TOLD YOU.

[train rumbling]

[train horn blowing]

[plucked string music]

* *

>> YOU.

FUCKING GUY.

SO YOU--WHAT ARE YOU DOING
F-FRIDAY, SATUR--

WHAT ARE YOU--

I'M BUSY FRIDAY.

YOU KNOW YOU WANT THIS.

DON'T LIE.

DON'T LIE TO ME.


YOU'RE SOMETHING SPECIAL.

YEAH, YOU ARE.

>> SCOTT, BREAKFAST.

>> UH, COMING.

[leaves crunching]

[gun clicks]


>> HEY, HOLD ON.

>> WHO'S THERE?
>> I'M COMING.

DON'T SHOOT.

OH, WOW.

NICE SHOT, MR. BRAGG.

>> I TOLD YOU
NOT TO COME AROUND HERE.

THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
YOUR HEAD.

>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE BEST SHOT IN THE UNION.

>> DOESN'T MATTER.

ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

HERE.

YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD SHOT.

YEAH, I COULDN'T GO THIS YEAR
ON THE HUNTING TRIP,

BUT, UH, HOW'D YOU DO?

>> I DON'T KNOW.
MY MOM WOULDN'T LET US GO.

>> WELL, THAT'S A FUCKING SHAME.

IT WAS ABUNDANT, I HEARD.

DEER AS FAR AS YOU COULD SEE.

>> MM-HMM.
>> YEAH?

YEAH, I STILL HAVE
QUITE A BIT LEFT OVER

FROM TWO YEARS AGO, YOU KNOW?

AND I CURED IT MYSELF.

>> OH, REALLY?
>> MM-HMM.

YOU WANT TO--
YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

>> UH, SEE WHAT?

>> THERE IT IS.


YOU GOT YOUR SHANK,
YOUR HOCKS,

SHOULDER.

THOSE ARE RIBS,
REALLY GOOD RIBS.

AND THAT RIGHT THERE,
THAT'S THE ASS.

>> THE WHAT?

>> THE ASS.

>> DO YOU REALLY EAT THAT?

>> WELL, YEAH.

THAT'S THE BEST PART.

>> YOU LIKE ASS?

>> YES, OH, YEAH.
HERE.

TELL YOU WHAT.

THERE YOU GO.

>> YEAH, I JUST DON'T WANT IT
TO GO BAD IN THE LOCKER.

>> YOU'RE TURNING DOWN
A PIECE OF ASS?

>> WELL, I MEAN, I--
I SHARE A LOCKER WITH SOMEONE,

AND I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'D WANT

A PIECE OF ASS
IN THE LOCKER, YOU KNOW?

>> [laughs]

>> HEY, SCOTTY.

>> HI.

>> YOU TAKING THIS TO SCHOOL
WITH YOU TODAY?

>> OH, OH, YEAH, I--

>> YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU
GO FIND ADRIANNA?

>> [snickers]

NICE SUIT.

>> YEAH, MY MOM MADE ME WEAR IT.

>> YOUR MOM STILL MAKES YOU
WEAR THINGS?


I WOULDN'T GO BROADCASTING THAT
IF I WERE YOU.

>> THE SWEATER...

LOOKS NICE.

>> THIS SUIT, THOUGH,
IS KIND OF--

JUST DOESN'T FIT ME
THE WAY--

>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA BE LATE.

LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
IN THE CAR, OKAY?

>> WELL, NO, I CALLED A CAB.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

>> WHY, ESPECIALLY NOW,
ARE WE WASTING MONEY ON CABS

WHEN I HAVE
A FLEXIBLE ENOUGH JOB

TO DRIVE YOU TO THE STATION
AND PICK YOU UP?

>> BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO PUT YOU OUT, ALL RIGHT?

I HAVE ALL THESE INTERVIEWS
ALL OVER THE CITY.

>> EVERY DAY,
YOU HAVE AN INTERVIEW.

>> MELISSA, LISTEN.

THIS THING--THIS THING,
IT'S KICKED MY ASS.

YOU KNOW THAT.

SOMETHING GOOD IS GONNA HAPPEN.
I PROMISE.

REALLY.

>> OKAY.
>> YOU LOOK NICE.

>> DON'T FORGET
TO TAKE YOUR PILLS.

>> YOU HAVE A NICE DAY.

[door clicks shut]

[high-pitched droning]

[car engine revs]

[furnace droning]


[bell rings]

>> EVER SINCE HE GOT SICK,

HE SPENDS MORE TIME
WITH THE STUPID DEAD DEER

THAN HE DOES WITH US.

IT'S HUMILIATING.

>> WELL, MAYBE BECAUSE HE
DOESN'T HAVE A JOB OR WHATEVER,

IT'S--YOU KNOW, IT'S HIS WAY
OF MAKING UP FOR IT.

YOU KNOW, LIKE, HE, UH--

HE HUNTS FOR FOOD OR WHATEVER.

>> THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING
OBSERVATION AND ALL, BUT NO.

I DON'T THINK SO.

>> I MEAN,
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GUYS

ARE THE MUNSTERS OR ANYTHING.

>> I, UH--I GOT TO GO.

I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

[plucked string music]

* *

>> IT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM,
MR. PATEL,

RIGHT HERE ON LONG ISLAND.

UH, IN ALL HONESTY, MR. PATEL,
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF INTEREST,

BUT AS THEY SAY,
NO CIGAR.

I TOLD YOUR WIFE,
IF YOU'RE THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT,

YOU HAVE YOUR PICK
OF EXPOSURES.

THE SUN DOES RISE
IN THE EAST, YES.

WHERE DOES IT RISE IN INDIA,
MR. PATEL?

[slams phone]

>> WHAT'S THE MATTER?

>> IT'S--IT'S JUST BEEN
A ROUGH COUPLE WEEKS.

[exhales nervously]

YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR MY SOB STORY.

>> WELL--WELL, LOOK,
WE'RE FRIENDS FIRST, RIGHT?

>> I'M SORRY.

I'M JUST A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.

>> I UNDERSTAND.

>> CHARLIE'S...

CHARLIE IS NOT THE GUY
THAT I MARRIED.

>> WELL, WE ALL CHANGE
SOMEWHAT, NO?

>> YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT, GOD, WHY ME?

I MEAN, A BUS, A ROBBERY,
AN ACCIDENT.

BUT LYME DISEASE?

>> HEY, LOOK,

YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
WHO HAS LYME DISEASE, RIGHT?

[flashbulb clicking]

>> SMILE.

OKAY.

>> ENJOY YOURSELF NOW,
DICK WEED.

[makes farting noise]

FARTLETT.

>> OKAY, LOOK AT THE BIRDIE.
LOOK AT ME.

>> I WILL FUCKING DESTROY YOU
THERE, BLUE EYES.

TODAY I'M GONNA SHOVE
A TELEPHONE POLE

SO FAR UP YOUR BUNG--

>> COME ON.
GIVE ME A SMILE.

>> [cackles]

[makes farting noise]

>> I THINK BLAZE SALADO
IS INTO ME.

>> WHATEVER.

>> WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO?

I MEAN, HE'S SO MINT.

BUT I DON'T KNOW.

>> HIS REAL NAME ISN'T BLAZE.

IT'S SOMETHING REALLY DORKY
LIKE BARRY.

>> [makes farting noise]


HEY, FARTLETT.

WE NEED TO TALK.

>> WE DO?
>> YEAH.

UNLESS YOU'RE TOO SCARED.

>> NO, I'M NOT SCARED.

>> GET OVER HERE,
YOU LITTLE DICK.


NICE SUIT, FARTLETT.

>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

>> I SEE YOUR NIGGER-RICH DADDY

DRIVING ALL OVER TOWN
IN HIS PORSCHE,

AND I WANT SOME MONEY
FOR MY OWN, OKAY?


>> TODD, WHAT THE FUCK?

LET HIM GO.
YOU'RE SUCH AN ANIMAL.

>> $20 EVERY FRIDAY.

OH, YOU'RE A MOTHERFUCKER.

GET THE FUCK OVER HERE.

GET THE FUCK OVER HERE.

ADD $20, ASS WIPE.

>> ASSHOLE LOSER.

>> SLUTTY WHORE.

>> SCOTT, ARE--
ARE YOU OKAY?

DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL YOUR MOM OR SOMETHING?

>> NO, I'M FINE.

>> WELL, HOW ARE YOU
GONNA GET HOME?

>> JESUS, JUST GET
THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

>> WELL, I'M JUST SAYING I CAN
CALL YOUR MOM IF YOU WANT.

SHE CAN BRING YOU AN ICE PACK
OR SOME YOO-HOO OR SOMETHING.

>> JUST--WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

JUST GO.

>> FINE.

>> [sobs]

>> I MISSED THE FRICKING BUS.

>> THIS IS THE BEST BIRTHDAY
PRESENT I COULD POSSIBLY GET.

BUT IN YOUR LETTER,
YOU SAID

THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE
TILL NEXT WEEK.

I MEAN, I'VE GOT IT--
LOOK, RIGHT HERE.

>> IT'S OKAY.
MA, I KNOW. I KNOW.

I GOT OUT A WEEK EARLY.

I JUST FORGOT TO CALL
IS ALL, OKAY?

>> OKAY, YOU KNOW, I JUST--

I--YOU KNOW ME.
I LIKE TO BE PREPARED.

YOU KNOW,
I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THAT.


OH, HONEY, YOU LOOK SO THIN,

YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU GOT
RICKETS IN YOUR BONES.

I MEAN, WHAT DO
THEY FEED YOU THERE?

>> UM, PRETTY MUCH
THIS KIND OF STUFF.

>> OH, GOD ALMIGHTY.
>> I'M SORRY.

NO, IT'S GREAT. I LOVE IT.
IT'S GREAT. THANK YOU.

[phone rings]

MM, BEFORE I LEFT,

MY COMMANDING OFFICER TOLD ME
I MIGHT BE ACTIVATED

BECAUSE OF THE FALKLANDS,
SO BASICALLY I'M HERE

TILL TOLD OTHERWISE.

>> OOH, THE BALKAN ISLANDS.
I SAW THAT ON TV.

>> BALKAN, FALKLAND.

>> HELLO?

HI, HONEY. HI.

>> ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH, JIMMY.

>> OH.

[sobbing softly]

[tires screech]

[rock music playing on radio]

* *

[tires squealing]

>> SO YOU LEARNED ALL THAT
IN THE ARMY?

>> TO FIGHT?

NO, THEY TEACH YOU
HOW TO KILL THERE.

>> WITH YOUR HANDS?

>> HANDS, YOU KNOW, GUNS,

KNIVES, GRENADES, WHATEVER.

>> SO DID YOU HAVE TO REGISTER
THEM AS LETHAL WEAPONS?

>> WHAT, MY HANDS?

I THINK THE ARMY
DOES THAT FOR YOU.

>> FUCKING "A,"
THAT'S COOL, JIM.

SO YOU HAD TO CONTROL YOURSELF,

LIKE, YOUR INSTINCTS.

THAT IS AWESOME.

>> OH, BUT ABOUT YOUR EYE...

>> OH, YEAH, NO,
I'LL TELL MOM

I WAS PLAYING DODGEBALL
OR SOMETHING.

>> GOOD MAN.

DOES IT HURT?

>> OH!

I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

SO LUCKY YOU GOT JIMMY TODAY,

'CAUSE IF THAT SHIT WAS ME...

CALL ME FARTLETT?
YEAH, THAT'S COOL.

CALL ME FARTLETT. WHATEVER.
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY.

YOU HIT A GUY LIKE THIS,

BOOM, DEAD.

WAH-WAH-WAH.

BAH.

MOLLY MOLLOY,

BORN IN DUBUQUE, IOWA.

HAS A DOG NAMED STELLA
AND FEEDS IT RED MEAT ONLY.

ADRIANNA BRAGG,

15,
NOW IN THE 11TH GRADE,

SYOSSET HIGH,

NO DOG.

>> SCOTTY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

COME DOWN
AND EAT ALREADY.

>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

>> OH, MY GOD.

>> I'LL BET I MAKE THE COVER
OF <i>ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST.</i>

>> AND IT'S YOURS?

>> NO, I BOUGHT IT
FOR THE RAG HEADS UP THE BLOCK

THAT JUST HIT THE LOTTO.

YES, IT'S MINE.
IT'S OURS.

HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU.

THIS IS GONNA BE
THE LAUNDRY ROOM RIGHT HERE.

THIS IS THE KITCHEN.

I PUT IN ONE OF THOSE CENTER
ISLANDS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

SCOTT, THIS IS GONNA BE
YOUR ROOM.

>> WOW, LOOKS LIKE
THE <i>MILLENNIUM FALCON.</i>

>> YEAH, MICK, IT'S, UH--
IT'S VERY MODERN.

>> YEAH, IT'S MODERN.
IT'S ULTRAMODERN.

I USED THE BEST ARCHITECT
ON THE ISLAND.

>> REALLY?

IS THERE STILL TIME TO--
I DON'T KNOW--

MAYBE, UH, TAKE THE EDGE OFF
SOMEHOW?

>> TAKE THE EDGE OFF?
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

>> NO.

>> YOU MEANT <i>MILLENNIUM FALCON</i>
IN A GOOD WAY?

>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

>> CHECK THIS OUT.

THIS IS WHERE THE SUNROOM
IS GONNA BE

WITH THE EASTERN EXPOSURE.

GET THAT MORNING LIGHT
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT--BEAUTIFUL.

THE WINDOWS ARE DOUBLE-PANED,
PLATE GLASS, SLIGHTLY TINTED.

THEY COST A FORTUNE,
BUT THEY ARE--

smooch--
BEAUTIFUL.

>> YEAH, BUT WOULDN'T IT
JUST BE CHEAPER

IF WE BUILT A SUNROOM
ON OUR HOUSE?

>> WE DON'T HAVE THE ACREAGE
ON OUR PROPERTY.

WE COULD BUILD
A TENNIS COURT HERE.

>> WE DON'T HAVE ANY
TENNIS PLAYERS IN OUR FAMILY.

[train horn blows]

>> MAYBE YOU COULD LEARN.

>> WE COULD PUT
A TENNIS COURT IN NOW

IF I WANTED TO LEARN, MICKEY.

>> WELL, YEAH, WE COULD PUT IN
AN ABOVEGROUND POOL TOO.

BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL
BE BACK IN QUEENS.

>> IT WOULDN'T BE
SUCH A BAD THING, WOULD IT?

>> TO BE BACK IN QUEENS?
>> YEAH.

>> COME ON, MOM. DON'T ARGUE.
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

>> WE'LL BE INSIDE.

>> [sighs]

YOU COULD HAVE
AT LEAST WARNED ME.

I MEAN, A DECISION LIKE THIS
YOU MAKE WITHOUT ASKING ME,

MOVING OUR FAMILY?

>> IT'S NEXT DOOR.

WE'RE NOT MOVING.
WE'RE UPGRADING, YOU KNOW?

IN WITH THE NEW.

OUT WITH THE OLD.


>> WHAT IS IT WITH QUEENS?

SHE'S LIKE DOROTHY
IN <i>THE WIZARD OF OZ.</i>

>> IT'S DIFFERENT THERE.

SHE HAD HER NEIGHBORS AROUND
TO COMPLAIN TO.

TAKES HER MIND OFF THE PROBLEMS.

>> WHAT PROBLEMS?

SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEMS.

>> YOU SOUND LIKE DAD.

>> I DO?

THEY DON'T EVEN FUCK ANYMORE.

>> WHAT? HOW THE FUCK
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

>> YOU KNOW THE RUBBERS
UNDER DAD'S BED

WE USED TO USE
AS WATER BALLOONS?

>> EW, YEAH.

>> THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THERE
IN OVER A YEAR.

>> OKAY, WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

THAT'S SICK
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT,

AND SECOND, SHE'S COMING,
SO SHUT THE FUCK UP.

[chuckles quietly]

[serene acoustic music]

* *

>> FOUND THEM
IN MY WINDOW WELL.

>> WHAT IF THEY HAVE PARENTS
WHO WILL BE WORRIED

IF THEY DON'T COME HOME?

>> YEAH, IF FROGS WORRY,
I GUESS.

>> WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD
HAPPEN IF I DIDN'T COME HOME?

>> THEY'D LOOK FOR YOU.

>> WHO?

>> I DON'T KNOW.

MAYBE THEY'D SEND
BLAZE SALAD FUCK.

I'M KIDDING.

REALLY, I'M--YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY
HE NEVER ASKED YOU OUT.

>> IT WAS WEIRD
SEEING YOU GET YOUR ASS KICKED.

>> WELL, HE'S BIGGER THAN ME.

WASN'T A FAIR FIGHT.

>> YEAH, BUT--I DON'T KNOW--

I FELT LIKE YOU WERE,
LIKE, MY, UH--

MY LITTLE BROTHER OR SOMETHING.

>> REALLY?

YOUR BROTHER?

>> YEAH.

>> YEAH, I BETTER GO.

>> WHAT? NO, COME ON.

I'M--I'M KIDDING.
I WAS JOKING.

I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T MEAN IT
IN A BAD WAY.

NO, I WAS--
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

>> I'M NOT MAD.
>> GOD, YOU'RE BEING SUCH A...

>> NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SMOTHER IT WITH SOMETHING.

THEN YOU CAN PULL IT OUT.

>> SHUT UP.

CAN YOU JUST SHUT UP
AND LET ME DO THIS?

[slow heartbeat]

[heartbeat quickens]

>> [exhales heavily]

>> WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

[foot stomps]

>> IS IT A BAD ONE, DAD?

>> YEAH.

>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
A BAD ONE?

>> DEER TICK.

>> OH, MY GOD.

OH, MY GOD.

>> YEAH.

>> WELL, WHERE DID IT HAPPEN,
OUTSIDE OR IN THE HOUSE OR--

>> I DON'T KNOW.

IT'S FILLED WITH BLOOD.

>> OH, MY GOD.

SCOTTY, I'M SO--

>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
YOU FEELING OKAY?

>> I'M SO SORRY.
>> YEAH, I'M FINE.

>> HE'LL PROBABLY HAVE
TO GET A--

>> WHAT?

>> BLOOD TRANSFUSION.


I'M KIDDING.

IT'S NOT A BAD ONE.


>> THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

>> WHOO.

>> CHARLIE, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE HIM HOME, OKAY?

STOP SCRATCHING.

LET ME SEE.

>> IT'S NOT A BAD ONE.

ALL RIGHT?

>> WOULD YOU TAKE HIM HOME?

>> COME ON.
COME ON. LET'S GO.

LIGHTEN UP.

>> LOOK AT IT THROUGH HERE.

>> LOVELY.

>> [groans]


OKAY, OKAY, DON'T--

>> IT'S NOT FUNNY.
>> I'M JUST KIDDING.

YOU'RE HURTING MY ARMS.

JESUS.

>> COTTON BOWL,
A YOUNG JOE MONTANA,

ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE.

HE FELL ILL...

>> ALL RIGHT.


WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

>> WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?

>> WHAT DOES THIS FEEL--
THIS FEELS LIKE

JUST A PERPETUAL ACID TRIP
IS WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE.

>> [laughs]

>> WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?
I'M KIDDING.

YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT AN ACID TRIP IS.

>> [snickers]

>> HEY, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT AN ACID TRIP IS?

>> NO, I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.

>> GOOD.

GOOD.

NO, IT CHANGES.

I MEAN, SOMETIMES,
IT FEELS LIKE, UM,

THE FLU,
AND OTHER TIMES, IT'S WORSE,

LIKE, UM, YOU KNOW,
MY HEAD'S ON FIRE KIND OF.

YEAH.

HEY, UH,

YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO TELL
YOUR MOM ABOUT THE TICK.

>> [chuckles]
>> RIGHT? NO TICK?

>> RIGHT, NO TICK.
>> NO TICK?

>> NO--NO TICK.

>> BRENDA.

HI.

>> OH, MELISSA, HI.
>> HI.

HOW ARE YOU?

HOW'S YOUR NEW HOUSE?

>> OH--OH, IT'S--
IT'S COMING QUICKLY.

YEAH, I'M VERY HAPPY
WITH IT.

>> SO I'M SEEING YOU TODAY,
RIGHT?

>> OH, WHY WOULD YOU BE?

>> WELL, MICKEY SAID
THAT THE BOYS

WERE COMING OUT TO THE SITE.

I JUST--WELL, I FIGURED YOU
WERE COMING ALONG WITH THEM.

>> RIGHT.

YEAH, UM,

GOD, WELL, IT'S THANKSGIVING,
THOUGH.

AREN'T--ARE YOU WORKING TODAY?

>> INDIANS, YOU KNOW.

THEY HAVE DIFFERENT HOLIDAYS
THAN US.

HEY, HOW'S SCOTT DOING?

I'M SORRY. I WAS--

I WAS GONNA CALL YOU.

>> I'M SORRY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

>> HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT THE TICK?

>> STOP PICKING.

>> MOM, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW SICK YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN?

DO YOU?

>> I JUST LOOK LIKE
A TOTAL DINGUS.

DID HE CALL?

>> DID WHO CALL?

>> DAD.

[train horn blows]

>> NO.

>> ARE YOU MAD?

>> JUST DON'T START LYING
TO ME SCOTT, OKAY?

>> NO, I DIDN'T LIE.

YOU DIDN'T ASK ME ANYTHING.

>> YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME,
SCOTTY.

JUST TELL ME NEXT TIME, OKAY?

THAT'S IT.

>> MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
HAD A GIRL.

THEY TELL THEIR MOTHERS
EVERYTHING.

>> WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
ASKED GOD

FOR A MOTHER WHO DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT HER CHILDREN.

[phone ringing]

LOOK, JUST DON'T ARGUE
WITH ME RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

I'M SORRY.
I'M VERY TIRED.

HELLO.

YEAH, THEY'RE BOTH HERE.

JIMMY'S ASLEEP.

LOOK, WAS THERE ANY REASON
I WASN'T INFORMED

OF THIS LITTLE FIELD TRIP?


YEAH, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT,

UH, AND I DON'T HAVE TIME
ANYWAY.

DINNER'S AT 4:00 SHARP.

GO WAKE YOUR BROTHER.

>> THE IDEA IS TO PRESELL OFF
THE MODEL, AS MANY AS I CAN,

THEN BORROW FROM THE BANK
TO BUILD.

THIS IS, UH, SCOTT STREET,
AND THIS IS JAMES.

>> NOBODY CALLS ME JAMES
ANYMORE.

>> HAD I KNOWN, JIM,
I WOULD HAVE NAMED YOU,

YOU KNOW, BOARDWALK, PARK PLACE,

LEXINGTON, MADISON.

>> WHY DON'T WE JUST MOVE HERE?

>> WELL, THIS
IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING

FOR PEOPLE MAKING
$20,000, $30,000 A YEAR.

THAT'S NOT US ANYMORE.

>> WELL, HOW MUCH
DO YOU MAKE?

>> THAT'S A BAD HABIT, SCOTT,

ASKING PEOPLE HOW MUCH MONEY
THEY MAKE.

YOUR DAD, IT'S OKAY.

BUT BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR,

WE WILL OFFICIALLY
BE MILLIONAIRES.

AND YOU CAN QUIT
THAT ARMY SHIT,

MAKE SOME REAL DOUGH, RIGHT?

* DA DA-DA DA-DA DA-DA
DA-DA DA-DA DA-DA DA-DAH *

[music playing loudly]

[smoke alarm beeping]

>> OH, JEEZ.

OH.

OH.

AH.

GOSH.

OH.

I'M SORRY. I MUST HAVE
FALLEN ASLEEP UP THERE.

HOW IS IT?

>> UH, SAD TO SAY,
THIS BIRD HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS.

OW.

>> OH, I...

WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?

OH, GOD, WHAT A WASTE.

AH, WELL, AT LEAST
WE HAVE EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

YEAH?


OH, I'M SORRY.

>> DAD'S SITE IS AWESOME.

>> HOW NICE.

>> YEAH, IT'S--IT'S HUGE,

LIKE, THE SIZE OF SIX
FOOTBALL FIELDS TIED TOGETHER.

>> WOW.

>> YEAH, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
LIKE A MODERN-DAY LEVITTOWN.

YOU SHOULD GO OUT THERE.

REALLY, IT'S AMAZING.

DAD SAID BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR,
WE'LL BE MILLIONAIRES.

>> MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS.

JIMMY, DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW WE USED TO LAY OUT

ON OUR ROOF IN QUEENS,
REMEMBER?

>> OH, YEAH, YEAH,
AND WHAT'S-HIS-NAME,

THE OLD NUT NEXT DOOR--
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

>> OH, GEE, UM, VELTRY.

>> VELTRY, RIGHT.

OH, YEAH, HE'D JUST SIT
IN HIS WINDOW FOR HOURS,

LURKING LIKE--

>> YEAH, EXACTLY, LIKE THAT,
WITH THAT FACE.


>> DID YOU BURN ANY TURKEYS
BACK THEN, DOROTHY?

>> DOROTHY?

YOU--YOU SAID DOROTHY, RIGHT?

WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

>> BECAUSE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS CLICK YOUR HEELS TOGETHER,

AND YOU'RE BACK IN QUEENS.

>> [inhales sharply]
AH.

ON THAT NOTE.


ANYBODY UP
FOR A HOT GAME OF MONOPOLY?

>> [laughing] YEAH.

>> GOOD, 'CAUSE I AM.


SHIT. SHIT.

I'M--GOD DAMN IT, I'M--

>> ALL RIGHT.

WOW.

>> SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL
SO STUPID, YOU KNOW?

>> IT'S OKAY, MOM.

[atmospheric xylophone music]

* *

>> HI, DAD.
>> HEY.

>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

[dog barking]

>> UM...

NICE SHOES.

>> COULD YOU--
COULD YOU ZIP THIS UP FOR ME?

>> UH, SURE.

SWEETIE, DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE KIND OF COLD

WITH--WITH ALL
THE BACK EXPOSED LIKE THAT?

>> DAD, DAD, COME ON.

IT'S FINE.
I HAVE A JACKET.

AND IT'S A CHURCH PARTY.

>> THE--THE STRAP THING,
THE PINK--

>> YES.
>> YOU CAN SEE IT.

>> DAD, SINCE WHEN DID YOU
BECOME SUCH A SQUARE?

>> BUT DO YOU KNOW
THAT YOU CAN SEE IT?

>> YEAH, YEAH, IT'S--
IT'S PART OF THE DRESS.

>> THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE--
THAT'S THE LOOK?

>> THAT'S WHAT THE GIRLS
ARE WEARING THESE DAYS.

>> OKAY.

TELL ME WHY YOU THOUGHT
I WAS CRAZY.

YOU'RE NEVER HAPPY.

YOU HATE DAD.

AND NOW I DO TOO.

I, LIKE, LIKED YOU.

IDIOT.

THAT YOU WEREN'T HAPPY

ON YOUR WEDDING DAY?

>> TELLING ME
THAT YOU FELT TRAPPED

MINUTES BEFORE THE CEREMONY

DIDN'T EXACTLY BRING
A FUCKING SMILE TO MY FACE.

>> I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TUX.

>> SO THIS IS ALL JUST
SOME BIG MISUNDERSTANDING?

>> MAYBE, MAYBE.
>> OH, OKAY.

YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE?
WELL, NO MORE.

I MADE MY DECISION.

I WANT YOU OUT
OF THIS FUCKING HOUSE.

>> THIS BOY DOES NOT HAVE
THE LUXURIES YOU DO.

HE'S LESS FORTUNATE
THAN YOU ARE.

>> YEAH, HE'S STILL
A FUCKING ASSHOLE.

>> SCOTTY, GOD DAMN IT.

>> OW.

WHEN JIMMY CAME HERE,
HE ALMOST KILLED HIM.

HE DIDN'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

>> WHAT, JIMMY BEAT
THIS BOY TOO?

>> YES, A LONG TIME AGO.

AND I HEARD YOU SAY "FUCK"
1,000 TIMES LAST NIGHT.

>> WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
>> "FUCK, FUCK, MOTHERFUCKER."

>> SCOTTY, STOP IT.
>> YOU KNOW, FUCK THIS.

OH, YEAH,
I'M SURE YOU GIVE A SHIT.

FUCK YOU. FUCK DAD.
YOU GUYS FUCKING SUCK, MAN.

[train rumbling, horn blowing]

>> I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO DROP BY AND SEE THE PLACE.

>> WHEN I PICKED HIM UP
FROM SCHOOL TODAY,

HIS PRINCIPAL INFORMED ME THAT
HE'S BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A WEEK.

>> THIS O'LEARY
GONNA PRESS CHARGES?

>> NO, NO, THEY'RE NOT, UH--

MICKEY, THEY'RE NOT
GOOD PARENTS.

>> WELL, PUNISH HIM.
YOU KNOW HOW.

>> BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

>> LOOK, WE ALL NEED
TO LEARN

HOW TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR OUR ACTIONS.

WE SHOULD AT LEAST PAY
FOR THIS BOY'S MEDICAL EXPENSES.

>> FINE.
>> HE DID HIT ME FIRST.

>> NO, THAT WAS MONTHS AGO.

>> AND HE CALLED YOU
A NIGGER-RICH SAVAGE.

>> FUCK HIM
AND HIS MEDICAL BILLS.

>> THAT WAS MONTHS AGO.

AND, WHAT, YOU'VE BEEN WAITING

FOR THE RIGHT TIME
TO POUNCE HIM?

>> [quietly] NO.

TODAY HE CALLED ME FARTLETT.

>> HE CALLED YOU WHAT?

>> FARTLETT.

>> SCOTT, SCOTT,
YOU DON'T THINK.

WHAT DID I TELL YOU
WHEN I BUILT THE SITE

ABOUT PEOPLE BEING JEALOUS?

DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

>> I DON'T HAVE TO FUCKING
LISTEN TO YOU ANYMORE.

FUCK YOU.

[door clicks open and shut]

>> MICK.

>> WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT?

YOU DON'T NEED ME
TO PUNISH HIM.

>> NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

>> WHAT IS IT ABOUT, THEN?

SOME TWISTED WAY FOR YOU
TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD?

>> NO.

LOOK, DIVORCED
AND SEPARATED PARENTS

LET THEIR KIDS
GET AWAY WITH MURDER

BECAUSE THEY FEEL GUILTY
THAT THEY BROKE UP THE HOME.

BUT IT'S A TRAP

'CAUSE THE KIDS WIND UP
FEELING RESENTFUL,

AND EVEN WORSE, ON DRUGS,
GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE.

>> [laughs]

I MEAN, I'M OUT OF THE FUCKING
HOUSE 18 HOURS AND 45 MINUTES,

AND YOU'RE
DR. FUCKING RUTH NOW?

>> SHE'S A SEX THERAPIST, MICK.

AND I SAW IT ON <i>DONAHUE.</i>

IT IS TRUE.

>> HE'S MAD BECAUSE
YOU THREW HIS FATHER OUT.

IT'S NORMAL.

>> IS IT NORMAL THAT NOW HE SAYS
HE HATES HIS FATHER?

IS THAT NORMAL TOO?

>> THEN YOU ACCOMPLISHED
WHAT YOU SET OUT TO DO.

>> AND WHAT'S THAT?

>> TO PIN THE WHOLE THING
ON ME.

>> OH.

WOW.

I CAME HERE FOR HIM,

AND NOW YOU'RE MAKING IT
ALL ABOUT YOU.

WOW.

>> SHE STILL AWAKE?

THAT'S GOOD.

THROW ME DOWN ONE.

>> ONE WHAT?

>> THE SMOKE,

I COULD SEE IT
FROM MY WINDOW.

>> SINCE WHEN DO YOU SMOKE?

>> DON'T BE A TIGHT-ASS.
THROW ME ONE.

THIS THING ISN'T GONNA LIGHT
ITSELF, YOU KNOW.


THESE ALWAYS REMIND ME
OF MY DAD...

WHEN HE WAS DYING OF CANCER.

I WAS YOUR AGE.

HIS DAD DIED FROM IT TOO.

HE WAS SO HELL-BENT
THAT HE WAS GONNA GET IT,

HIS NERVES WERE SHOT.

THE FUCKING DOCTORS
ACTUALLY TOLD HIM TO SMOKE.

LYING IN THAT BED, 80 POUNDS,

STINKING UP THE WHOLE ROOM.

AH, WHAT DID THEY KNOW
BACK THEN, RIGHT?

HEY, COME ON DOWN.
WE'LL GO TO CARVEL.

WE'LL GO GET A SHAKE.

>> NO, I'M TIRED.

I HAVE SCHOOL TOMORROW.

>> YOU'RE SUSPENDED.

>> STILL, MOM WILL GET MAD
IF I GO THIS LATE.

>> IT'S NOT EVEN 11:00.

COME ON DOWN.
SHE'LL NEVER KNOW.

>> THEN I'LL BE A LIAR TOO.

[train wheels clicking]

>> I NEVER LIED TO HER, SCOTT.

SHE JUST NEVER BOTHERED
TO ASK.

IT ISN'T SOME STATE SECRET THAT
WE HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING ALONG

AND FOR A LONG TIME TOO.

PEOPLE DO STUPID THINGS
WHEN THEY'RE TRYING

TO GET SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T FIT TO FIT.

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

BUT I'VE ALREADY LOST ONE KID

BECAUSE OF MY PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE OTHER.

>> WELL--WELL, THEN WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO FUCK HER, DAD?

>> IT'S TOUGH
TO BE A MAN, SCOTT.

YOU GOT TO MAKE MONEY
TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE.

YOU GOT TO BE A DAD
TO YOUR KIDS.

YOU GOT TO BE A HUSBAND
TO YOUR WIFE.

THE MONEY PART I GOT.

THE DAD PART, I'M BATTING .500.

THE HUSBAND PART...

THEN OTHER PEOPLE
COME INTO THE PICTURE

AT THE RIGHT OR THE WRONG TIME,
AND THINGS HAPPEN.

I WAS UNHAPPY.

I AM UNHAPPY.

BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE OKAY.

NOW, PLEASE, COME DOWN HERE

BEFORE FUCKING CARVEL CLOSES.

>> I CAN'T.

[ambling acoustic music]

* *

>> HERE IT IS.

OH.

OKAY.


I MEAN, YOU'RE GROWING SO FAST.

HERE, LET'S PUT IT ON.

OH, NICE.

WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
A SAINT'S NAME,

BUT IT'S TOO LATE
TO CHANGE IT NOW, HUH?

SO STAND UP STRAIGHT.

LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

GOD, YOU LOOK LIKE A PRIEST.

>> MOM.

>> OKAY, HOW ABOUT, UH,
YOU KNOW,

YOU LOOK LIKE AN ANGEL.

THERE YOU GO.

HEY, LISTEN TO ME, SCOTT.

SCOTT.

I KNOW YOU'RE MAD,
AND THAT'S FINE.

BUT, UH...

I HAVE MY FLAWS TOO.

OKAY, BABY?

OH, MICKEY, THE TIE.

>> COME ON OVER HERE
FOR A MINUTE.

>> I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU--
>> OH, SURE.

>> HAVE A SEAT.

I NEED TO SEE THIS.

YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
IS FUNNY?

HOW THEY SAY THAT TODAY

IS THE ACTUAL DAY
YOU BECOME A MAN.

[church bell tolling]

I MEAN, HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?

>> IT'S JUST A CEREMONY.

IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN
ANYTHING LITERALLY.

>> WELL, DON'T RUSH IT, OKAY?

IT'S NOT ALL IT'S CRACKED UP
TO BE.

ALL RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT, WE GOT TO CUT
THIS GODDAMN HAIR OF YOURS,

FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

OKAY.

LET'S NOT KEEP GOD WAITING.

[static buzzing]

>> IT'S MUGGY TONIGHT, HUH?

I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT COMING.


ALWAYS THE PARTY POOPER.

IT'S ALL RIGHT.

I'LL BRING YOU HOME
SOME LEFTOVERS, HUH?

[high-pitched droning]

[furnace droning]


[high-pitched droning]

>> [whispering] WOW.

[upbeat funky music]

* *

>> * NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE *

* ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS A BAND OF GOLD *

* ALL THAT'S LEFT
OF THE DREAMS I HOLD *

>> YOU KNOW, I HAD, UH,

 <i>DONAHUE</i> ON THE TV SET
THE OTHER DAY.

AND THEY WERE SAYING HOW PEOPLE
WHO GET SEPARATED--

UH, AND THEY DIDN'T SAY
WHAT NUMBER,

BUT A PERCENTAGE OF THEM,
A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THEM

END UP GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

>> HUH.

>> COULD BE BULLSHIT.
I DON'T KNOW.

YOU, UM--

YOU WANT TO, UH,

HELP ME MAKE A FEW OF THESE GUYS
IN THIS ROOM JEALOUS?

>> HI.

>> NICE PARTY.

>> YEAH, YOU KNOW MY DAD.

EVERYTHING'S GOT TO BE BIG.

>> COME TALK TO ME.

>> I GOT TO TELL YOU,

IT'S GETTING AWFULLY LONELY
OVER THERE.

YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
MAYBE TONIGHT,

BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION,
I COULD, YOU KNOW--

>> MICKEY...

LOOK, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
THE FATHER OF MY CHILDREN.

AND I RESPECT THAT.

BUT IF YOU WANT
TO SPEND THE NIGHT,

IT'S GONNA BE ON THE COUCH.

YOU GOT THAT?

>> I'LL TAKE IT.

>> I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
TALKING TO ME.

>> I'M ON THE FENCE.

>> WELL, IF IT MEANS ANYTHING,

TECHNICALLY,
I'M A MAN AS OF TODAY, SO--

>> PLEASE, A MAN?

I HEARD YOU'RE STILL
A BALD EAGLE.

YOU KNOW, NO PUBES.

>> WHO SAID THAT?

>> ME.

I JUST MADE IT UP
AND TOLD ANYBODY WHO'D LISTEN.

I'M JUST KIDDING, JERK.

SILK?

>> UH, I DON'T KNOW.

>> IT'S NICE.

CAN I TRY IT?

>> SURE.

>> SEEMS LIKE FOREVER AGO
SINCE I HAD MINE.

SO MUCH HAS CHANGED.

>> IT WAS ONLY LAST YEAR.

>> IT'S DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS.

A LOT CHANGES IN A YEAR.

>> WELL, YOU KNOW,
A LOT CHANGED FOR ME TOO.

>> YOU KNOW HOW I ALWAYS SAID
I DATE OLDER GUYS?

WELL, IT'S NOT TRUE.

I MEAN, IT'S TRUE, BUT...

I NEVER LET THEM,
YOU KNOW...

I'M STILL A VIRGIN.

WELL, WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

>> WELL, SO AM I.

>> DUH.

LET'S GO INSIDE.

>> [exhales deeply] FUCK.

>> ALL RIGHT,
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

YOU NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR TELLING
YOUR DILL WEED FRIENDS

THAT YOU FINGERED ME, YOU KNOW?

>> I'M SORRY.

>> AND, UM,

YOU'RE NOT GONNA, LIKE,
USE ME OR WHATEVER, RIGHT?

>> N-NO.

ARE WE GONNA,

LIKE, DO IT?

>> [snickers]

DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT?

>> SORRY.

>> [snickers]


>> WHAT'S WRONG?

>> [snickers]

NO, THAT--THAT WAS A GOOD THING.

>> UM, COULD--
COULD YOU HELP ME?

>> [grunts]

[static buzzing]

[birds chirping]

[high-pitched droning]

[intense high-pitched droning]

[intense high-pitched droning]

>> HEY, HEY.

SO...

HOW DO YOU FEEL?

>> I, UH...

UM...

>> AFTER LAST NIGHT.

YOU CAN TELL ME.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
DO YOU FEEL

A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY, UH--

'CAUSE I KNOW YOU JUST--
YOU'RE A DIFFERENT PERSON.


YOU'RE OFFICIALLY A MAN
IN THE EYES OF THE LORD.

>> [sighs deeply]

[high-pitched droning]

>> I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

THIS ISN'T A MARRIAGE.

EVERY DAY,
YOU LOOKED AT ME IN THE EYE,

AND YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU
WERE GOING OUT TO FIND A JOB.

WHAT DID YOU DO,

PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK
DOWN IN THE BASEMENT?

SO YOU'RE A 150-POUND BABY
I'M CARRYING ON MY BACK?


I NEVER KNEW
I COULD HATE ANYBODY

AS MUCH AS I HATE YOU, CHARLIE.

DON'T IGNORE ME.

I MEAN, I DON'T MIND WORKING.

BUT IF I WANTED TO BE
THE--THE--THE BREADWINNER,

THE GODDAMN MAN OF THE HOUSE,

BELIEVE ME, I WOULDN'T HAVE
PICKED YOU TO BE MARRIED TO.

IGNORE ME, CHARLIE!


[high-pitched droning]

[birds chirping]

>> [groans]

[high-pitched droning]

>> WHAT?

>> NOTHING.

[high-pitched droning]

[bus engine rumbling]

[engine backfires]
