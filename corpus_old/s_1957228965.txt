[Narrator] The following dramatization

is inspired by an actual event.

Composite and fictionalized
characters have been used.

(dramatic music)

(door banging)
(dramatic music)

You failed.

Okay, good.

The island Napoleon was first exiled to?

Oh, wait, I know that one.
All right.

Um...
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

(imitates buzzer)

Elba.
(students groan)

Roman god of war?

Ares.
Ares is a constellation.

I'm looking for a god.

(imitates buzzer) Mars,
like the candy bar?

Maybe you've heard of it?

We are in trouble here, kiddies.

I know you guys got a lot on your minds.

Date to the big dance.

Football game, winter break.

But next Monday, we gotta face the music.

So, I suggest we suck it up,

and we show everybody in
the world that nobody,

and I mean nobody

messes with Kenny Kroft's Johnson Jackals

Academic Decathlon Team!

(bell rings)
All right?

(class applauds)
Nobody!

Now get outta here.

Wake up, now.

Hey, hey, hey, hey,

I wanna see you all here tomorrow at two.

None of this senior ski day routine.

I'm stuck here,

you guys are stuck here, all right.

Stopping by.

Hey, Aaron.

Look,

you gonna bless us with
your presence, you know.

Girls won't participate.

I knew you knew those answers.

Then there's no problem.

Hasta manana, Mr. K.
Yeah.

Okie dokie, Aaron.

[Mimi] Where you been all night?

Hand me my cigarettes.

You don't need them.

You know what they told you.


I don't need no advice from you, mister.

What I need

is for you to

start pulling your weight,
and get yourself another job,

'cause your rent is going up.

What?

My what?

Mom, I'm paying more than
my fair share already.


Listen.

You are a grown man.

I can't do this alone anymore.

If I don't get my medical
premiums in on time this month,

Mr. E. Walsh is gonna cut me off flat.

And then what's gonna happen?

Why you always asking me?

(coughing) Where you going?

Where you going?

Where the hell you going?

(upbeat music)

â™ª Day after day â™ª

â™ª Trying to even the score â™ª

â™ª Tire crossed the road â™ª

â™ª More of the horde â™ª

â™ª Not gonna break it down,
gonna break it down â™ª

â™ª No one to hold â™ª

â™ª More off than this
world, more of this world â™ª

â™ª And it's somebody else's car â™ª

(tires screech)

â™ª Nobody's in my sight â™ª

â™ª Nobody's in my sunrise â™ª

Five, six, seven, eight.
Check 'em out here

trying to bust a move.

Girlfriend got two left feet.

[Frankie] I mean, she's gonna
make a fool outta herself.

Go help her out.
I'mma do that.

Go Travis, go Travis, go Travis,

can't play out here, get the way out here.

(all talking at once)

Oh shit.
Nicole!

Oh, all right, get off,
off my boy, off my boy.

Ah, incoming freshmen.

(kids laughing)

[TV Reporter] An 11-year-old girl

was the latest tragic casualty

of gang violence in Los Angeles today.

The child was asleep in her bed.

I was watching that.
Big city.

That's what you want.

Looks real beautiful.

It doesn't have to be L.A.

We live in a big country.

It could be any other city.

Like where, San Francisco?
That's a very pretty town.

So a freeway can fall on
us during an earthquake?

Or how about your beloved New York,

so the girls can go to
school with metal detectors?

I grew up here, and I'm not leaving.

You know?

Maybe they're right.

Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a cop.

I mean, I'm a podiatrist's
son, for god's sake.

I wasn't even able to have a BB gun.

You'll shoot yourself in the eye.

I'm not laughing, Skip.
Yeah, but you will.

I want you to laugh, Margaret.

My father is a great judge of character.

And he never would have hired you

if you weren't right for this job.

Yeah, but unfortunately, your
father is no longer sheriff.

Unfortunately, he's not calling the shots.

And day after day after
day, I'm stuck in an office

with a bunch of rednecks
who think that your husband,

their father, is a joke.

All right, guys, sit
down, listen up, will ya.

We got today's hot list,

we got two OTL's on the hit parade.

We got Susan Dixon, juvenile runaway.

She's 14 years old--
Let me guess.

Last seen in the company of her boyfriend.

(officers laugh)
That's right.

Last seen in the company of
her boyfriend, thank you.

See, it's not our job to comment.

We just go out, we find
her, we just bring her back,

so we can do it all again next week.

The Watkins Brothers out by Route 14

have been duking it out again.

Let's see, Matt and Crawford,

you wanna stop by the
steakhouse along about noon

and talk to those boys, thank you.

Last and least, we got
the Johnson High School

homecoming dance tomorrow night.

Yeah, we need a babysitter to go out

and make sure that these esteemed scholars

don't drink themselves into oblivion,

and rearrange our telephone poles.

So, I took a drawing, and guess who won?

Skippy!
(officers applauding)

Thank you everybody,
meeting's dismissed.

Have a good one.

We're counting on you, big guy. (laughs)

(televisions playing)
(dramatic music)

Look, ma, don't forget
to pick me up after school.

There's a reading at the
college I wanna check out.

Aaron, this is getting
to be a real drag.

I can't structure my days around
you, I have my own classes.

When are you gonna get your license?

It's been two years.

I'm tired of playing chauffer.
Fine, fine.

I'll walk,

but, don't expect me to help
you with your homework anymore.

You are so lucky I need you to pass.

Aww, Aaron, are you sure
you won't reconsider?

Look, Ma, don't start.

I got kicked outta high school

for wearing a granny dress and no bra.

Oh my god!
I refused to shave my legs,

and I certainly wasn't gonna
go to any school dance, but,

you know, sometimes I regret it.

I'll take my chances.

Love you.
Oh, honey.

(bell rings)

(students chatting)

Sir,

howdy do?

[Aaron] I don't think so.

[Girl] I got it.

What about your brother?

Are you serious?
He's perfect.

He fills up the tux,

you do not have to be nice to him,

and you know he's not gonna attack you

at the end--
Okay.

I'm not going to the homecoming dance

with my little brother. (giggles)

Well, you're not staying home.

You're not giving them the satisfaction.

I couldn't care less
what they think, actually.

Hope they're happy together.

They're perfect for each other.

Losers.
(dramatic music)

[Girl] Who's car we taking?

Yours.
Yeah.

Whoa, no wait, we can't take mine.

(kids groan)

If they got my license plate
pulling out of the parking lot,

my parents would kill me.

They'd lock me in my room until I'm 47.

47, Sam.
Uh huh.

Fine, we'll take my car for a change.

My dad knows I'm ditching anyway,

so.
Whoa!

Wait a second, you told your old man

that you're ditching
school, and he said okay.

Yeah, after a two-hour argument.

We're ready to go?

Who's car we taking?

I changed my mind.

It's too crowded.

Know what?

Think I changed my mind, too.
Me too.

See ya.
Bye!

Here you go, ladies.

Take all you need, but use all you take.

And remember what they say,

you're only cheating yourselves.

[Sam] I can't believe
I'm copying homework.

I'm not supposed to be here, anyway today.

[Boy] Oh, Kroft, Kroft.

Hi, Mr. Kroft.
Jennifer.

Good morning, Mr. Kroft.
Let's take a walk.

Close the door.

Aaron,

I turn in my midterm grades
three weeks from today.

Have a seat.

Unless you do a major turnaround

the second half of the year,

you're not gonna graduate.

That's not a good thing, is it?

No, it's not.

You know,

when I was growing up, I had
this friend, Bobby Powell.

Best natural baseball player I ever saw.

Guy could roll out of bed,
stroke a double up the alley.

Never trained a day in his
life, never thought he had to.

You know what happened?

Everybody caught up
and finally passed him.

(bell rings)

All that natural ability
right down the drain.

A wise ass attitude
and a handful of talent

only take you so far.

And if you refuse to do
your homework assignments,

you're not gonna get a diploma.

It's just a piece of paper.

(dramatic music)

So, I'll station myself
right here in the parking lot

that way I'll able to

intercept any child who
is thoughtful enough

to bring his own liquid refreshments.

Everything is under control.

Principal Dresser's
out there with a deputy.

He must be getting serious
about kids cutting out.

[Teacher] Come give me
a hand with these beakers.

[Aaron] Uh, hey, want
me to give you a hand?

[Jimmy] Better let the master do it.

I'll take care of it.

Thank you.

I thought he took off.

Did the cops ground him or something?

Transportation problem,
nobody wanted to drive.

[Teacher] Okay, class
open your books to page 118.

(dramatic music)
(knocking on door)

[Mimi] Jason.

Jason?

You can't hide in there forever.

I need you to ride up to the store

to pick up my prescription.

Yo, Mr. Substitute,

I don't know who gave you them wack notes,

but you better go check with
Principal Dresser or something,

'cause this is not Spanish.

This here is Chinese.


Your kung fu's good, but mine's better.

Very funny.

I'm sure you have a bright future

as a standup comedian.

We've got 55 minutes together,

so let's not make this any
more painful than it has to be.

Everybody open your books.

Okay, senor.

[Jason Voiceover] Dear mom.

I want you to know that I don't blame you.

I'm sorry for acting mean sometimes.

I know you've always
done the best you could.

No matter what people tell you,

none of this is due to bad

parenting.

Social uprising isn't just
a part of our distant past.

What about what happened in L.A.

after the Rodney King verdict?

Jennifer?

I don't know if that was
a social uprising, I mean,

I bet that most of the
rioters didn't even know

who Rodney King was.

They were just using it as
an excuse to steal stuff.

[Kroft] Okay.

(dramatic music)

[Jason Voiceover]
Sometimes the disappointment

is too much to take.

I love you.

(dramatic music)

(siren blaring)

Hey, what about my cousin, Leo?

Maybe he'd drive up for the weekend.

No. (laughs)

I'm not going.

Besides, he's not gonna
come all the way out here

just for me.

What about Aaron Sullivan?

He's kinda cute.

In a weird way.


(dramatic music)

[Jason Voiceover] Forgive me.

(dramatic music)

Excuse me.

Hello.

[Jason Voiceover] P.S., if I die today,

bury me someplace beautiful.

(dramatic music)

And since there's injustice everywhere,

nowadays when it's so
tough on the streets,

you do it to me, and I'll do it to you.

Just like the Old Testament says,

and eye for an eye, and
a tooth for a tooth.

All right.
Good stuff, huh?

Powerful, intelligent, concise writing

from our boy, Travis.
What, what? (laughing)

Y'all just jealous.

[Teacher] Audrey, you're up, come on.

(dramatic music)

I'm outta here.

Watch this.

(speaking foreign language)


Ladies and gentlemen,
in tonight's main event,

all the way from South
Central L.A., we have

the scrappy Have Nots taking
on the undisputed champion

Haves for all the marbles.
(imitating crowd cheering)

Remember me?

Dr. Livingston, I presume?
(class laughs)

I'm supposed to go to Copper Lake

three times a week for night school.

(imitating buzzer)
Answer is

what the hell are you talking about?

I wonder who forgot their
homework in Mr. Harkin's class.

(dramatic upbeat music)

Get back in your seats,
everybody just, just calm down.

Stay here.

Stay here, I'll be right back.

(dramatic upbeat music)

(kids screaming)
What did he do?

What's going on out here?

(gun firing)
(kids screaming)

[Teacher] Everybody get
under your desks, now, do it!

â™ª Question the hearsay â™ª

â™ª Blessing, one, two, three â™ª

â™ª Help, does anybody understand this â™ª

[Man] Students, hurry up!

â™ª Outside â™ª

â™ª Looking me in â™ª

[Teacher] Please, don't shoot!

Please don't shoot!

â™ª Hot sauce â™ª

â™ª I can see you to be saved â™ª

â™ª And now your arms are
like clubs in rain â™ª

[Teacher] No, please don't shoot.

Please don't shoot me.

â™ª Just don't want to pray â™ª

â™ª Is anybody listening â™ª

Okay, I want everybody quiet.

No, just stay back.

Hear me, I'm gonna get help.

Just stay back.
No Miss Davis!

Stay back.
Oh my god!

(gun fires)
(girls scream)

â™ª Just in one, two, three â™ª

â™ª Is anybody listening â™ª


(sirens blaring)

[Officer] Tape off this area.

You go right here around the cruiser.

Out to the front of the car.

Go, go, go!

[Officer] All right,
come on, let's go, move!

[Boy] Don't shoot!

Oh, you come here, don't move.

Okay.
Don't move!

I want the teachers out of the building.

If I see any police,
I'm gonna kill everyone.

Move it!

Move it.

Go.

Go.

Get up there.

(sirens blaring)

There's no other shooting?

Why would someone do
something like this?

Let's not worry about
why, let's worry about who.

Miss Richard's just saw
a man entering the building

with weapons and guns all over him.

Hey, Eckert!

Eckert, come here.

I want you to look at a
teacher, Miss Richards.

She had some contact with the gunman.

Mr. Dresser, why don't you go
with him and point her out.

I know who she is.

My daughter has her for English.

Man, I'm sorry, I forgot.
That's all right.

She's not here.

I let her ditch to go skiing.

Had a big fight.

I'll go find Miss Richards.

Fine!

Fine!
Coming, coming.

Look, gather together

all the kids who were in
the building at the time,

and take them someplace for debriefing.

Where exactly?

You're a cop, for crying out loud.

Figure it out.
You can use the cafeteria.

I'll show you where it is.
Thank you.

All of you, get back, get back!

Get back!

Don't move!

Don't move!

Sit down, sit down!

Everybody, sit down!

All of you, sit down!

Sit down!

[Boy] Don't know, I
don't know what he wants

or who this guy is.
Shut up!

I said shut up!

You two, what's your names?

Frankie.
Willie.

Move it, come on!

Get over here!

Come on!

Come on!

Come on!

Get over there, get there,
get up, get over there!

Now listen, I want you
at the top of the stairs,

and I want you at the bottom.

Okay, and if you see some cops,

or you try to escape
and you don't tell me,

people are gonna die.

You hear me?
Mm-hmm.

You hear me?
Yes sir!

Move it, move, move it now!

You tell them not to screw around!

I mean it!

[Willie] He's not screwing
around, they better get back.

You tell them if I
see anybody with a gun,

I'll start shooting people.

He sees a gun, he's gonna kill people.

If he sees any of you guys,

he's gonna light this whole place up.

Copy that, over.

He's got a room full of kids up there,

and he's threatening to
blow up the building.

Ellis!

Cut the power of that wing.

Gary, I spoke to Miss Richards.

She got a look, average this,
average that, nothing much.

Who's our hostage negotiator?

Do we even have one?

Yeah.

Yeah, I sent a guy to the
FBI course last summer.

[Eckert] God help us.

(crying) Where's my mother?

I need my mother.

Jen, come on.

Come on, we gotta get outta here.

(Jennifer crying)

(sirens blaring)

Okay, everybody listen up.

Now, sooner or later,
they're gonna come for us.

And when they do, just everybody
just cooperate with them.

Okay?

[Girl] Why do you
think they're doing this?

Help, help!
What's wrong, Jimmy?

[Jimmy] I've fallen and I can't get up.

(kids laugh)

He wants everybody to
come into the other room.

[Kid] What?

He says if you don't come now,

he's gonna kill five of my friends.

Okay, um, everybody come on, let's go.

Remember, just like we talked about.

Everybody just, just
keep your mouths shut.

Come on, come on.
Not you, Mr. Braddock.

No, I'm not gonna let them--
Please, he said no teachers.

No--
Mr. Braddock.

You said it yourself.

We better do what they say.

[Willie] Hurry.

Okay, uh,

just do what they say,
everything's gonna be--

[Willie] He wants
everybody in a straight line.

[Mr. Braddock] Okay.

[Officer] We got the south side.

[Officer] Can we get
some tear gas in there?

[Boy] It's okay, Jennifer.

Come on.

Come on, you gotta try, come on.

I told you to shut up!

Get in there.

Get in there, move it!

Gimme that, let go of that.

Just do what he says.
Get in there, go, go, go!

Get over there.

Get in, get in, go!

Go!

Go!

Go!

Move it, go!

Go!

Will you shut up?

I told you to be quiet.

[Aaron] Please, it's gonna be okay.

(cymbal clangs)

Don't!
Hey, hey, easy!

Don't, don't!
Easy, easy.

I wasn't trying anything.
Get back!

Sit down!

Don't move!

I'll do whatever you say.

Get down.

(dramatic music)

You want me to make an example outta you?

Sit down.

You people better pay attention
to who's in charge now.

(dramatic music)

[Officer] All right,
Charlie, I'm gonna go--

(people chatting)

[Officer] Ellis, keep those people back.

My son.

Ma'am?
My son goes to this school.

Just calm down.
You know, you know my son.

You know Travis.

Don't you know my son?

He...
Calm down.

Oh my god.

Travis!
Wait.

(sirens blaring)

Richard?
Where are you?

[Man] Ellie?

Where's my baby?
Travis?

Travis?

(dramatic music)

Travis?

Do you know my son?

(people chatting)

Travis?

Do you know my--
Make way.

(dramatic music)

[Girl] I need help.

[Officer] Make way.

Richard!
Wanna talk with you.

(dramatic music)
(people chatting)

Bring it in, bring it in!

Set it down there, get back,
get back to the stairs.

Set it down right there on the desk.

Sit down.

Sit down!

No, get back.

Go to the stairs!

You.

Me?

You!

Yeah you, get up here.

Get up here, open it.

Open it.

(suitcase beeping)

Get it.

Hello?

Hello, I'm Skip Fine, I'm
from the Sheriff's department,

and who am I talking to?

Aaron Sullivan.

Hi Aaron, now listen.

I know you've got a problem up there,

and I'm here to help you.

So, if you just tell me
what it is you want--

Keep an eye on those stairs!

[Skip] We can get it for
you, you can come on out,

and then we can let all
those kids go, okay?

Uh, I think you got the wrong--

Who is it?

[Aaron] I think you got the wrong guy.

What do they want?

I'm, like, one of the prisoners.

How long till the FBI gets here?

They promised less than 30 minutes.

Well, they better hurry.
Okay, now Aaron,

could you do me a favor please?

Would you ask the gentleman with the gun

to please get on the phone--
What do they want?

So I can speak to him directly?

Oh, hold on.

It's for you.

It's the cops.

Set it down.

Get back, get back.

What?
Hi, this is Skip Fine.

I'm with the Sheriff's
Department, I'm a negotiator.

Who am I talking to?

Never mind.
I don't care

if it's your real name or not,

I just don't wanna feel
like I'm talking to the air,

you know?

He wants a name.

I need a name!
Uh, George.

(kids laugh)

I'm George.

Hi George.

My name is Skip.

I'm a negotiator with
the Sheriff's Department,

and I'm here to help you.

Oh yeah, well, Mr. Kroft,
man, he wanted to help me too.

Okay, and who is Mr. Kraft?
Kroft.

Mr. Kroft, he tried to help me pass,

and then he flunked my ass
with one fricking grade.

Knocked everything down, all my dreams.

You know, it is very apparent to me

that this really upsets you.

Upsets me, you're
damn right it upsets me.

It ruined my life.

I worked my ass off for those grades.

This maniac had Kroft as a teacher.

So, pull the yearbooks,

and have the teacher who saw him

see if she can pick him out.

Okay?
Got it.

[Jason] Turned out that
paper was not in there,

and he says, "Buzz, you failed!"

What are you staring at?

Okay, now look--
And he wants me to go to

Copper's Lake tonight to
go three nights a week

without a car?

I didn't have a car, man.

I just got one.
Okay, all right, but look.

Why don't we start fresh

right now.
It's too late.

It's not too late, George, come on.

Listen, we--
(dial tone rings)

(dramatic music)

Come on, come on, keep looking.

Maybe something rang a bell.

He couldn't have positioned
himself more strategically.

There's no way we could even think about

before nightfall.
What are you looking at?

Huh?

You know me?

Did I have a class with
some of you people?

You morons, you weren't
even here when I was here.

Look at this garbage they force you to do.

It don't mean crap in the real world.

Who's room is this?

Mrs. Yules.

Oh, that bitch.

She insulted my sister one time.

Even came to my house
and knocked on my door.

"Beth Copeland here?

"Beth Copeland here?"

Last name,

Copeland.

Jason.

(dramatic music)

[Girl] He's gonna kill us, he's crazy.

No he's not.

He's just trying to scare us.

That doesn't mean anything for sure.

What was that?

What was it, huh?

I heard somebody say something.

Now who was it?

(dramatic music)

Was it you?

It was me.

I...

My friend's not feeling well,

and she needs to go to the bathroom.

What's wrong with her?

She's

pregnant.

What the hell you doing in school?

Please?

Can't you just let her go?

I mean,

it's just one person.

(dramatic music)

She doesn't get better
later, I'll send her down.

But if you're lying to me...

You can go to the bathroom.

But you got five minutes,
you understand me?

And if you don't come back,

or you're late, you're gonna
kill some of your friends.

Frankie!

Keep an eye on her, she's
going to the bathroom.

(dramatic music)

She's got two minutes.
(dramatic music)

[Officers] Come with
us, let's go, this way.

This way.

[Jason] What the hell is that?

Frankie, I hear something.

Get up here, or I'm gonna shoot somebody!

(dramatic music)

Just keep going.
Hold it, I can't.

Watch your step.
He's gonna kill everybody!

[Officer] That's it!

Let me go!
Here you go.

I let her go to the fricking
bathroom, and what happens?

What did I say was gonna
happen if she didn't come back?

(gun fires)
(kids scream)

(phone beeps)
(dramatic music)

[Boy] It's the law.

Get it.

Hello?

Uh, George.

This is Aaron.
Aaron, Aaron,

is everything all right?

Is everything okay up there?

He shot the clock.

He shot the clock,
okay, he shot the clock.

How'd they get so close, huh?

You were supposed to be watching them.

What was I supposed to do?

They just came up and got her.
Don't screw with me Frankie.

You, get downstairs, go!

Run!

Get over there and watch.

Now, listen, uh, Aaron, tell me this.

Without letting him know are there more

than 10 people in that room with you?

Uh-huh.
Okay.

Are there more than 20?

Aaron, are there more than 20
people in the room with you?

Is he standing very, very close to you?

What's he saying?

They wanna know where you're standing?

You tell them I'm right in
front of a room full of people

with a loaded shotgun.

Aaron?

Aaron, now please listen to me, never

never tell him what I'm telling you, okay?

Lie to him if you have to, okay?

I can't do this by myself.

We're gonna become a team now, okay?

You listen to me, man.

I'm gonna start sending
them down in pieces,

and it's your fault.

Now, just give me a second.

Just explain to me what it is that I--

(dial tone rings)
You keep this under control.

I'm gonna write that down.

(dramatic music)

(sirens blaring)

[Officer] Anyone over here?

(people chatting)

Hey, hey.
Listen, listen,

I wanna talk to everybody all at once.

Listen to me, I'm gonna talk
to everybody all at one time.

Listen, if you can just
let me through now.

I'm gonna talk to everybody.
Where's my son?

Just give me a second.

Now, listen every...

Dammit.

Listen, if you all just
please settle down.

What is going on?

Please?

I just wanna see my son.

We have a trained negotiator
who is talking to the gunman,

and we have every reason to believe

that this thing is gonna
be settled shortly.

Very shortly?
Shortly?

Very soon, but we don't know.

It depends.

[Officer] I'm gonna need
a little bit of help, okay?

A lot of us didn't
do well in high school.

Let me tell you, I'm for one, you know.

I can't even spell.

[Jason] It ain't just that.

It's the other disappointments.

But then, George, let's
not make another one.

You know, there is still
time to end this peacefully.

And no one else has to get hurt.

(crying) Oh yeah, right.

The minute I walk through that door,

you guys wanna shoot me down like a dog.

Nobody is gonna do anything
of the kind while I'm here.

I mean, no one has died yet, George.

Don't you wanna keep it that way?

What?

(dramatic music)

I said no one has died yet.

Kroft.

I shot him up close.

Yeah, you did, but he's gonna make it.

(dramatic music)

I made a point, right?

I mean, I taught him.

You certainly made a point.

But why don't you just tell
me what is it that you want?

What are you thinking about?

(object clatters)
What's that noise?

I heard something?
George,

we will check it from down here.

I will send one of my guys--
Frankie, come here!

Go check it out, man.

Don't lie to me.
All right.

Go!
Okay.

(dramatic music)

Please,

don't shoot.

I'm a student.

I'm coming in.

Oh my god.
What's going on?

What's going on?

(everyone talking at once)

Who's down there, Frankie?

Are you talking to someone?

Listen, you better bring them
back by the count of three.

I'm gonna kill someone.

One!
(cocks gun)

Oh my god!
Two!

Don't, don't shoot!

I found him!

We're coming out.

(dramatic music)

Fine?

Brown, FBI.

He's an experienced negotiator.

[Brown] Why don't I take a crack?

Be my guest.

His name is George.

We have to make a move and soon

before he realizes there's
other people in that class.

Can you get in there?

We'll come down from the
roof, take out the window.

He'll hear that.

Maybe yes, maybe no.

But the door to the room's closed.

If you can keep him busy on the phone--

[Eckert] It's a crap shoot.

Let's rock and roll.

(dramatic music)

[Officer] You up there, Mike?

Okay.

(dramatic music)

[Officer] Perimeter is secure.

(phone beeping)
(dramatic music)

Hello George, my name is Kyle Brown.

I'm with the FBI.

I'd like to try to help you.

Oh, yeah, right.

Now, suddenly everybody wants to help.

George, if you'll
just work with me here,

I'm sure we can clear up
this whole misunderstanding.

Listen, I'm warning you.

I don't want any FBI guys trying anything.

I know about you guys.

Don't screw with me.

I absolutely will not.
You better not

because I got a room full of kids with me.

Now, that sounds like a lot of people

for one man to watch.

Why don't you send some of them out.

Oh, so they can tell you where I'm at?

George, everyone out here
is very, very concerned,

but no one will do
anything unless I say so.

(dramatic music)

[Girl] Who's that, who's that?

Back from the window.

I don't think so, man.

(knocking on window)
(dramatic music)

George?

Don't move, don't move!

(dramatic music)

George, talk to me, George.

(dramatic music)

[Officer] Get that
ladder around to the side.

Roberts on three!
Up there, Mike?

Okay.

(helicopter blades whirring)
(people shouting)

Hey.

Hi.

Hi, how'd you get past the blockade?

Who's gonna stop me.

That's a stupid question.

They told me you were
the contact to the gunman.

Yeah, but, the FBI got their gopher.

They have no right to
pull you out of there.

I didn't know what I was doing.

I couldn't live with

a room full of dead kids on my conscience.

[Woman] Come on, get a move on it.

Fine!

Fine, get in there.

He'll only talk to you.

You can do it.

You'll be great.

[Man] Let's go!

[Officer] Try to station this area here.

[Swat Leader] Okay, right.

[Officer] Okay, I thought
you had him on this side here.

Okay.

You lied again, Frankie.

You knew they were out there,
why didn't you tell me?

One more time, and that's it, all right?

Get the phone!

Get back to the stairs, go, go!

[Skip] Hi.

Who am I talking to?
Charlie Brown, speaking.

(people laugh)

No really, who's on the line?

It's that other cop, the
one you wanted to talk to.

Tell him I don't wanna hear
that FBI guy's voice again.

[Aaron] He doesn't wanna hear
that FBI guy's voice again.

Ah, no problem.

And tell him to turn on
the power and the heat.

It's freezing in here.

And he wants you to turn
on the power and the heat.

All right, power and heat.
And some aspirin.

Aspirin.

Is that okay, 'cause I
have kind of a headache.

Yeah, and some aspirin.

And, um,

some pizza?

(kids groan)

What?

Hostages always get pizza.

I've seen it in the movies.

[Jason] I only got five bucks.

That's okay, the cops will pay for it.

It's part of the rules.

Who wants pizza?

I do.
Yeah, I do, man.

[Girl] Me.

[Girl] Me too.

All right, but we all
gotta agree on a topping.

[Kids] Pepperoni, vegetarian,
anchovies, pepperoni,

Canadian bacon, black olives.

All right, give me the phone.

Extra garlic.
Ham.

Hey, listen up.

We want 15 extra large pepperoni pizzas

and we want five six packs of
root beer and five of cola.

And we want a thing of aspirin.

And we want them here in 15 minutes.

(kids cheering)
Okay, 15 minutes.

Okay.

Does anybody know the
number for the pizza?

That's his room, don't go in there.

No you don't have a right to be in here.

(upbeat music)

And he, just, oh, he, he
wouldn't do this thing, right?

I mean, just, just yesterday,

there were kids in the back yard, and he,

one of them had an air rifle.

And he shot, he shot a bird,

and he,

Dana, what for?

He wouldn't,

he wouldn't

do this.

And these, they're just targets.

He likes to go to the range.

He had four...

He cried when they're--

No, get outta here!

Get outta here, all of you.

I don't want you in here.

No, no, those are his, his secret books.

(dramatic music)

(Mimi coughing)

Miss Copeland.
He likes to read.

We'd like you to take a
ride with us over to Johnson.

No, I can't.

I can't go, I can't. (crying)

(dramatic music)

Anybody's a senior?

You're the only one?

Who's not gonna graduate?

You're screwed.

Take it from me.

You can't get a job.

No job, no money.

No money, no nothing.

I had a good job,

240 bucks a week,

installing the microchips
in the computers.

I mean, that's the most important part.

I mean, without the chip, there's nothing.

And then they canned me
'cause of no damn diploma.

I just gave you all A's.

(kids cheering)

Check this out.

[Woman] You got a call on line six.

Well, that's great. (scoffs)

We got a room full of hostages

who have no sense of their own mortality,

and a suicidal gunman who
only wants to talk to a local.

You know, wait a minute.

I don't need a play-by-play.

I didn't ask for this job.

He wanted me on the
phone, okay, I'm so sorry.

So, either grab an oar
and start to paddle,

or get out of the boat.

Wait a minute.

We're all on the same side here.

I'm here to help.

We're all waiting.

Look, this kid absolutely wants to believe

that he hasn't killed anybody,

and that's exactly what we should keep him

and everybody else in that room believing.

Yes, but what about the families?

I got them in the gym, we
need to tell them something.

It's not right.

Our responsibility is to the children

that are alive in that room.

Can't we pull the families aside

so they don't mix with anyone?

What happens if they talk
to other family members

who then in turn talk to the media?

What if it was one of your
kids up there in that room?

Then my daughter would
still be lying there

an hour from now.

(dramatic music)

Okay.
Okay.

(dramatic music)

Gotta calm down, you're
gonna make yourself sick.

They've got my baby in there.

Mine too.

But,

it's not gonna do any
good to get all worked up

until we know something.

Okay.

Aww.
Okay. (crying)

(dramatic music)

George?

It's probably none of my business, but,

well, I was just wondering.

You think maybe you're putting
a little too much importance

on this diploma thing?

Oh yeah, smart guy?

Try talking to me after
you've been beat up

in the real world awhile.

I'm probably gonna get the chance.

My grade point average is so low,

I have to bend over just to look for it.

You know, there's, there's time.

We're young.

[Jimmy] Hey, uh, can we go get the TV

from Mr. Braddock's room?

Come on.
Yeah.

Yeah, go, get it.

All right, cool.
All right.

[Jason] We can watch
ourselves on the news.

Tell Randall to cut the
cable to the building.

Are you kidding?

It says right here in the manual.

Here, isolate the subject
from the outside world.

I don't want this kid
getting any information

that doesn't come from me.

Please move now.

I don't know who's worse.

[Aaron] Your boyfriend's
not too bright, is he?

He's not my boyfriend.

But, I always used to
see you guys together.

Yeah, well, ancient history.

(phone beeping)

[Jason] Get it.

I, I gotta go.

It's for me.

Hello?

Aaron, are you alone on this line?

Yeah.
Okay.

Now, without counting,

can you tell me how many people
are in the room with you?

[Jason] Are they screwing around?

What are they saying?

[Skip] Tell him that the pizza is here.

[Aaron] They said the pizza's here.

[Skip] And that we only have five pies

and three six-packs of cola.

But we ordered 15 pizzas.

Are they screwing around?

Look, they only got five pizzas,

and they messed up on the root beer.

They only got cola.

Listen, I got a lot
of hungry people here,

and that's not gonna be enough food.

Hey, listen, George,
you know what it's like

to order pizza on a Friday afternoon.

The rest will be along here shortly,

you know, and if they're
not, hey, they're free.

It better be.

Now listen, I'm gonna send some
of my people down to get it,

and you better not screw with them.

I wouldn't do that.

Okay, now listen.

You know, the thing is that
since all the food is not here,

and I know that you don't
want anybody to go hungry,

you know what I was thinking?

Why don't we send some
of the hostages out,

that way you'll have
enough food for everybody.

I know you don't want
anybody to go hungry.

Forget it, no way!

Tell him you want the pizzas first.

I can hear the phone.

I want the rest of the pizzas,

then we can talk about
the other stuff later.

Oh, by the way, if you're
thinking about drugging the pizza,

don't bother, I'm not eating any.

Uh, George, George,

before you hang up, can I ask
him if they could call my mom

and tell her I'm okay?

She's probably all freaked out.

Go ahead, man.

Hey, Skip, hi, it's Aaron again.

Um, look I was wondering if
you could call my mom for me

and tell her I'm okay?
Okay, now the thing is

we've contacted her,

she already knows.
Her name's Peggy Sullivan,

she's listed.

Hold on, I'll ask.

Uh, George,

they wanna know if it'd
be all right with you, um,

if we got some pens and paper,

and everyone wrote their
name and phone number down,

so they can contact all our parents

and tell them we're all all right.

(dramatic music)

[Officer] Yeah, they're
coming, they're alone.

Get ready.

Come on, come on.

Quick.
How you guys doing up there?

Is everybody okay?

Here's the list of names.

Which one of you guys is Skip?
Let's make it quick,

I don't want him to get suspicious.

Now look, inside the lid of
this cooler is a video camera.

What, oh, look at that.

How'd he get that in there?
Pay attention.

Now look guys, all you fellas have to do

is keep the lid up,

and just point it in
George's general direction.

Then forget about it.

Don't make it a big deal.

You understand?

62 kids in there.
Okay, it's ready.

You guys are doing a fine job up there.

I just want you to know
how much everyone down here

appreciates it.

Here you go, good luck.

[Eckert] Come on, get going.

(dramatic music)

[Officer] Matt.

What?

[Officer] Your daughter's in there.

(dramatic music)

No, no she's not.

(dramatic music)

That's not right.

She's not here.

She's skiing.

I said it was okay.

(dramatic music)

Trav?

Travis?

Travis?

Travis.

Oh.

Look, bro, why'd he have to do that?

(dramatic music)

Trav.

Trav.

Why did he have to go and do that?

[Jason] What's taking
so long down there?

Hurry up!

[Aaron] Frankie.

Frankie, we gotta go.

[Jason] I'm gonna shoot somebody

if you don't get up here now.

(crying) Damn, man.

(dramatic music)

[Jason] Quit screwing
around and get up here.

It's taking too long.

Frankie, he's gonna freak out.

(dramatic music)

This thing really works.
Great picture.

There he is.
Bingo.

I don't see her.

I don't see her, if she's up there,

then why don't I see her?

Because she's probably in the back

being quiet like a smart girl.

Oh, don't close it.

[Jimmy] I don't know what's
wrong with this stupid thing.

What is it, what is it?
Wanna see?

Hey, we got the radio,
we can try some tunes.

So, try the radio?
Yeah, put 'em on.

Oh, thank you kid.

This is really helpful.
This is bull, man.

[Brown] 12 gauge?

And what is that, .357?
The rest of that pizza

better get here.

They're screwing with us.

I don't want any,

anyhow, so--
Why?

It' snot drugged, they
know I'm not eating any.

Well, it's not that, it's just,

I'm a vegetarian.

We only got pepperoni.

Well, why didn't you say something?

Look, I don't wanna go along with the

cops or anything, but

we don't have enough food for everyone.

Maybe we should let a few people go.

Well, how many, I mean,

what 10, 15?
15 sounds pretty good.

Fine, pick 'em.

Well, I mean, I really
think it would be better

if you picked them.
Look.

You either pick them right
now, or you can forget it.

Look, just take the bad ones.

And please, make her one.
(girl crying)

[Aaron] You need to get
out of here, you need to go.

Lot of people.

Frankie.

[Boy] Come on.

Please go, I'll be the only one, I'll go.

Come on, it's time to go.

Frankie.

Come on.

You gotta get outta here, okay?

[Boy] We outta here.

Yeah, you.

What about me?
Me.

Hi.

Did you wanna go?

You can let someone else go.

Right here, come on.
I'll go.

Eric, can you let us go, man?

My name's Aaron.
Yeah, right, Aaron.

Look, I'll give you my disc player, man.

You're so dead.

If we ever get outta this
place, your ass is mine,

you understand that?

Huh, huh, what?

(upbeat music)

[Aaron] Come on, come on, let's go.

Let's go, come on.

[Girl] Oh, please.

[Aaron] Go.

Go, go, come through.

Go.

Go on.

Go on.

[Girl] Thank you.

[Radio DJ] 40 minutes of nonstop music

on Hot 97, with the Lakers accelerating.

Hey.

Hi.

So,

why didn't you go?

Why didn't you go?

You could have picked yourself, you know.

I guess I didn't really think about it.

Yeah, right.

I guess I just kinda wanna
see how it's gonna turn out.

It's messed up, huh?
We interrupt this broadcast

for a special report--
Shut up!

[Radio Reporter] With
some new information

on the growing crisis
at Johnson High School.

Oh my god.

[Radio Reporter] As many
as six students are dead,

and nearly 20 others are wounded

in what may be the worst mass
killing in state history.

That is the latest--
They said no one died!

They said no one died.

Somebody changed the channel.

[Radio Reporter] The
FBI are on the scene

where apparently 200 students
are still being held hostage.

Sam, dear?
The gunman is believed to be

Jason Copeland.

(dramatic music)

Hey, where the hell do
you think you're going?

All you're gonna do is get her killed.

Well then, do something!

Do something!
Hey, hey.

If the phone starts him now,
he could pull the trigger.

(phone ringing)

Hello?
Hey Skip,

I got a serious problem here.

I don't know what to do.

I need your help.

You better talk to him.

(dramatic music)

Come on, George, don't.

George, please don't.

Okay, don't do this.

Don't do this.

[Skip] Hi George.

Cut the crap.

You know who I am.

[Skip] Okay, that's true.

I just wanted you to be
comfortable enough to tell me your,

your name yourself.

So, what is your real name?

Jason.

Okay.

Hi Jason, how are you?

Not good.

You lied to me.

You told me nobody died.

And that's the truth.

I don't know where you got
the other information from.

Father.

Lord in heaven.

The radio, that's where.
Thy kingdom come.

(praying softly)

[Jason] They said a lot of people died.

Okay, what you have
to understand, Jason,

is that media loves to
sensationalize everything.

They make everything bigger.

That's their job.

The truth is

nobody

has died.

Liar.

My heaven.

I am not, Jason.

I am not lying to you.

I want you to listen very,
very carefully, okay son?

What if you did kill all those people?

You would not, look,

you would not be in this school anymore.

You would be in the morgue.

'Cause no matter what you say,

we could be in that room,
(snaps fingers) just like that,

as fast as we want.

But I really believe that at this moment,

that just as necessary,

I really believe that
we can work this out.

(dramatic music)

(heavy breathing)

How?

How?

[Skip] That's what
we're gonna do together.

(dramatic music)

Okay.

Let's get Matt a cup of coffee.

Decaf.

Bill,

I want you to contact the radio
stations, and you make sure

that nobody broadcasts
anymore injury reports.

(mellow music)

Come on, stop crying.

I wasn't really gonna shoot you.

Look, I lost my temper.

You wanna go to the bathroom?

Go ahead, it's all right.

Why don't you see if
anybody else wants to go.

And then,

you be in charge.

Go.

I said, go.

(phone beeping)

Yes.

Just, Skip, hold on a minute.

Skip?

You know, listen to me.

I'm not coming out until we talk

about what's gonna happen to me.

I'm not gonna spend the
rest of my life in a jail.

Tell him what he wants to hear.

You know what I was thinking, Jason,

there's a very good possibility

that there might not be
any jail time whatsoever.

You guys,

I'm gonna send you to the bathroom, okay.

But don't come back.

Look, look, come on.

I know I'm not gonna get
slapped on the wrist for this,

but if you stick me in a fricking cell,

don't you think I'm gonna go
crazier than I already am?

All right, well then, let
me ask you this question:

what do you think an
appropriate punishment would be

for Jason Copeland?

(mellow music)

They're back.
It's just all a mistake,

you know?

I mean...

(kids chatting)

Pick Frankie.
Okay.

[Radio DJ] Four non-stop hits on Hot 97.

Hey, Frankie.

Frankie, you've been up here a long time.

Why don't you go down to the
bathroom and wash up a little.

Okay?

Come on, let's go.

Come on.

Frankie, don't come back.

We'll be down soon.

What, Sam, you're not going to pick us?

Jealous?

Excuse me?
You heard me.

Drop it, Kathy.
No, no.

It's just that I don't expect
to find my best friend or my--

Hey, hey, are you guys demented?

[Sam] You know what,
just go, both of you.

Just get out of here.

(dramatic music)

You know how some people were born

winners,

and some losers?

[Skip] I do.

But let me tell you something.

You're not alone in this
feeling of not belonging.

I totally understand that.

I deal with it every day.

Hey, Jason?

Um,

you know what, I have
to take a break here.

All the coffee is starting to get to me.

I gotta go to the men's room.

I'm gonna call you right back.

Is that all right?

Is that all right?

Okay.

All right, thanks buddy.

(intense dramatic music)

Hey ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

You're getting ready to
take him out, aren't you?

Sniper's in place, we've got the shot.

Yeah, but that's not necessary.

The kids are leaving the room in droves.

He's ready to give up.

What happens if the sniper misses?

Won't happen.

Can you guarantee that?
Can you guarantee

he won't short circuit again?

Look, you've got a shooter in place.

If he goes south, you can
pop him just like that.

I'm this close, Sheriff.

I'm asking you, please,
let me finish my job.

(dramatic music)

[Officer] Red light.

(dramatic music)

Repeat, red light.

Red light.

You better be right,
because if we did it my way,

we'd be sending in the
clean up crews right now.

[Skip] Now, I've seen a lot
of judges show compassion,

especially after a guy like
me stands up and says, look,

he really had a tough time.

You know, he just kind of
lost it there for a bit.

Judges really consider that.

Look, how much time do
you think I'm gonna get?

All right, well, that's
a very good question.

I can only guess at that.

I would say that you would get, um,

approximately,

probably under five years.

And you know that most of
that could counseling time.

Well, that's what I need, man.

I need more counseling than jail time.

That's right, I agree with you.

And I hope that you are not
picturing those big, you know,

stone fortresses.

This is kind of like a
detention home, you know,

and they even have programs

where you can go out during the day,

and go to school.
Skip, Skip, listen.

I can't be stuck in with gang members.

[Skip] If you want me to, I
will use my contacts for you.

You mean that?

All right, how do I know you're
gonna keep your word, huh?

[Skip] Have I ever lied to you before?

Will they put it in writing?

Listen, I want everything I agree to,

you to put in writing,
and then I'll come out.

Okay, we have no problem
with a written agreement.

But before I can send
that up to you, Jason,

I'm gonna need a good
faith release of hostages.

[Jason] All right, I'll send down five.

And then when the contract
comes up, if I like it,

I'll let the rest go.

Well, I don't think five is gonna do it.

We were thinking more in terms of 10.

Seven.
How 'bout 15?

10.

How 'bout this: five guys, 10 girls.

It'll look great in the press,
you get rid of all the girls,

and it's a smart move on your part.

All right.
Okay?

All right, you know what I was thinking?

Look, you've got 45 kids up there.

Why don't you just send down
an even half, all right.

Keep 20, send the rest.

Okay.
Great, great, all right,

then I'll tell you what.
You pick kids.

I'll start drawing up the contract,

and I will send it up

as soon as we start
seeing the kids come out.

And I'm gonna call you right back, okay?

Okay.
Okay.

What?

[Brown] You're terrific.

[Skip] What?

Well, you missed your calling.

All that wheeling and dealing,

you should have been a used car salesman.


What, what's so funny?
I was a used car salesman.

Get outta here!
That was my job before this.

(laughing) It's perfect.

(dramatic music)
(parents chatting)

[Man] They're letting them out.

(dramatic music)
(people shouting)

Samantha.

Where's Samantha, Kathy?
She's still in there.

Her and Aaron were the ones
that helped us get out.

Kathy?
Daddy?

You know, you know my son, don't you?

You remember him?

You remember Travis, have you seen him?

Have you seen him today?

He left in a gray sweatshirt
this morning, what had a hood.

Did you see my son, please?

Please?

Don't you know who he is?

Do you know who he is?

(dramatic music)

How's it look.

Huh?

What do you think?

One to five years.

That's sounds pretty good.

No, no, no, no, as soon
as I walk through the door,

they're gonna rip it up, man.

And then it's gonna be my
word against theirs, right?

Well, how about if you have all of us

sign it as witnesses,

and I can go downstairs
and make a bunch of copies.

They can't possibly rip them all up.

That'll work, that'll work.

No, no, no.

Hey, you, come here.

Let her do it.

Here.

Get the kids to sign it,
and make a bunch of copies.

Does he believe this?

(dramatic music)

(door rattling)

Frankie?

Oh my god.

(dramatic music)

We'll be right out.

(dramatic music)

[Boy] Yeah, I know.

[Girl] I'm gonna ask
for the credit cards,

and a car. (laughing)

Here you go, bro.

Frankie, where's Samantha?

Chill man, I sent her home.

I thought you left already.

You don't think I'm just
gonna let him walk away

after what he did to Travis, do you?

What, I'm just gonna hurt him.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

There's nothing in here
about the private cell.

We agreed.

Yes we did, yes we did.

It's an oversight on my part, Jason.

You know what, it's arranged.

It's all arranged.
Do not do this.

Now, we are almost outta here.

Do not sink to his level.

Talk to the police, we'll need them.

Forget him.
Get off.

(dramatic music)

Jason, Jason, why don't
you kind of stand up

and stretch your legs, you
know, get the blood going.

Hey, what are you doing?

Frankie!
Frankie!

Jason?

You're gonna try to kill me, Frankie?

What did I ever do to you?

(dramatic music)

What you done to me?

Why don't you ask Travis
what you did to him!

Why don't you talk to Travis!

Don't listen to him Jason.
Talk to Travis.

He doesn't know what he's talking about.

Please, he's a troublemaker.

He always has been, I swear to God.

We just gotta get him outta here, okay.

(dramatic music)

Frankie.

Frankie!

You listen to me.

Now, he will get what he deserves.

I promise.

I promise.

I guess it's too good for him.

(dramatic music)

(scissors clatter)

Bye, let's go.
Okay, bye.

Bye Jason.
Bye Aaron.

[Boy] See you guys.

Bye now.

Good luck, man.
Bye Jason.

(kids chatting)

[Girl] See you tomorrow.

Hey, hey.

Can you stick around for a minute?

(dramatic music)

Thanks for all your help.

(dramatic music)

[Aaron] Good luck.

It's all right.

(dramatic music)

(phone beeping)

Skip?

Jason, you have done just a great job.

Let's not have any slip ups now, okay?

Now, first thing I want you to do,

take all of your guns and
just put them in the corner.

All right.

All right, make sure that
you have absolutely no weapons.

And then I want you to
call me one more time.

Okay.
Are you ready?

(dramatic music)

(parents and kids shouting)

Frankie.

Frankie.

Where's Travis, baby?

Where's Travis?

He's coming out, right?

Mrs. McGill?

He's coming out, right?

Mrs. McGill?
He's coming out, right?

[Principal Dresser]
Can you come with us?

He's coming out.

Travis,

my...

He's coming out.

Mrs. McGill,

why don't you--
Don't!

Don't you Mrs. McGill me.

And don't you sugarcoat nothing.

Is my son dead?

Yes.
Is my son dead?

I'm so sorry.
Is my son dead?

No!

No!

You're lying!

You're lying!

You're lying! (crying)

My son!

My son, oh God.

Oh god.

Oh god please.

All right.

Um,

I'm ready to come down now.

Skip?

I was hoping that

maybe that you could come up here,

and maybe you could walk down with me?

I would really like
that, son, I really would.

But I can't.

But I promise you this.

I will be the first face you
see when you step outside.

Okay.

Now look, I feel
really silly about this,

but there's one more precaution.

Could you take off your shirt?

That way everyone will see that there is

absolutely no concealed weapon.

Look, man, I don't
want any cameras on me.

I don't want people taking
my picture with my shirt off.

I just don't want any mistakes.

Okay.

(dramatic music)

All right.

I'm ready to come down now.

(dramatic music)

I promised him.

I promised him.
Just wait.

I said I was gonna--

You've done everything you can do.

(dramatic music)

[Officer] He's turning around.

He's going back up the stairs.

â™ª The left and right â™ª

[Officer] Here he comes again.

We can't see behind his back.

Where's the weapon?

Don't move, move!

Look out, he's got something in his hand!

(everybody yelling)

Put the cuffs on him, now!

[Jason] Skip,

Skip!

[Officer] Get him up, come on.

â™ª You got the legacy â™ª

[Officer] Get the doors.

Let's go, come on.

Open the door.

We're bringing him out.

Come on, Sheriff, let's go.

Come on, let's go!

Get out of the way!

(upbeat music)
(people shouting)

I didn't know!

I didn't know they were gonna--

It's Skip, it's Skip!

Excuse me!

Listen, I am so sorry.

[Officer] Get him in the car.

Let's go, move!

(sirens blaring)

(dramatic music)

[Reporter] Now that Jason's captured

and is going into custody--
(people talking)

You did some job, huh?

Skip?
Yep.

You did the job.
Oh no.

We were some team, huh?

Yeah.

(dramatic music)

I heard he killed Mr. Kroft.
Yeah.

He was the only teacher that
ever bothered to talk to me.

[Mrs. Sullivan] Aaron?

Hi mom.
You're okay.

(dramatic music)

Your son is one solid citizen.

Well, I should have known

if anyone can talk his way
out of trouble, it'd be Aaron.

I'll see ya, huh?

Yeah.
Yeah?

Yeah. (laughing)

(dramatic music)

(mellow music)
