You fuckin son-of-a-bitch!

You're not even human!

Who made Ji-young and
Eun-joo bitter enemies?

You fuckin son of a bitch!

Stop them!

How dare you try to
sneak off by yourself!?

It is my fault and that's why
I cant' bear to stay here anymore!

It's your fault they're both dead!

Just what do you think
you're doing?

Kyung-min, what's wrong?!

You all right?

Look at here.

Kyung-min!
Breathe slowly, slowly.

Slowly, slowly.

What's wrong! Kyung-min!

Wake up! Wake up!
Ko Kyung-min!

Thoracotomy.

It isn't a hack job,
this was a bona fide surgery.

The breast bone and pectoral muscles
were cut without hesitation.

This is the work of a pro.

Do you have any idea
who it might be?

Do you think it's true
what Kyung-min said?

That this is all because I messed
with the cadaver?

That's what caused people to die
and Kyung-min to go crazy?

Ki-bum, I want to hear
what you have to say.

<i>The driver who was missed
is founded in couple of days.</i>

Ki-bum, you told me to
follow my heart, right?

<i>The heart influences
the movement of the body.</i>

<i>The heart is influenced by
outside waves.</i>

<i>When a person's state of mind
and body are weakened,</i>

<i>and the brain waves encounter
certain types of waves,</i>

a person can commit
the most heinous act...

What do you mean?

I've seen this happen before.

And these people have one thing
in common. They don't remember anything

and they all claim that
someone's trying to choke them.

They usually try to hurt themselves
and others.

Are you saying only Eun-joo's prints
were found on the scalpel

because an evil spirit had possessed her
and forced her to do that to herself?

Well,

whoever did it.

We may find ourselves alone
in the autopsy classroom

like Eun-joo and Ji-young.

Hey you!

You looking at me?

I've been there like three times!
Stop, Myung-ja.

I just came out of the grave, fuck!

I dare you! Assholes!

But we can'tjust let this go, right?

We can't take this just lying down.

Professor Han.

Do you ever regret it?

You're asking me this now?

I said this before, truth passes us by.
But faith preceeds us.

That faith is starting to suffocate
us all.

Two students have already died

and they were both sutured together
as if Yoon-ho did it himself.

But it's nothing compared to what
you did to me back then.

Just what are you trying to say?

Guess you'll just have to
wait and see.

The heart is missing.

Who could have done this?
And why?

You think it was some organ
smuggling attempt?

Lift her hand.

What are you doing here?

So you think the spirit of
this dead woman has killed two students

because she's out for revenge?

There's no proof yet but the cadaver is
definitely the key in this case.

There's no record of her at all and

all the victims have
the same scar as her...

Her name is Yoo-kyung SUH,
26 years old.

She signed over her organs before death.
We have her paperwork

and her family's consent
so that's why we have her cadaver.

The reason
there's no record of her is that

I turned over the originals to the police.

I understand your concern and fear.

But acting like a bunch of
superstitious fools is not becoming of

future medical doctors.

Do not become a disgrace to our
profession and our school.

But we've all been having
the same nightmares.

If we are bound to help those
in pain then what if the spirit

in our dreams needs.

So that's why you're a necrophilia.

What?

Weren't you treated in highschool
for showing unnatural attachment

for corpses and were diagnosed

with high possibility of
developing necrophilia?

That, that was...

The police are on this, you kids
need to get back to your books.

Now get out of here.

Sun-hwa! Sun-hwa!
It's not true!

I told you.
My father owned a funeral home

and I became used to seeing him work.
My mom didn't like that

and that's why she sent me to
therapy.

Ki-bum,

I don't think I know you anymore.

<i>We may one day find ourselves alone
in the autopsy classroom.</i>

Sun-hwa!

Sun-hwa, are you OK? Sun-hwa?
Wake up! Wake up Sun-hwa!

You all right?

Wow, you're pretty strong.
I'm pretty heavy.

I've been working out for a day
like this.

Ki-bum.
Huh?

Mentally disturbed is similar to
being possessed, right?

I'm not crazy!
Are you drunk?

I'm not drunk...

Ki-bum.
Huh?

I'm saying this for the first time,

but my father's like that too.

Like what?

My father's in the mental ward too.

I see.

But he was a great father.

So sweet and caring. Like you.

What happened to being sick of it.

But he's a serious case now.

'Cause you know what,
he killed my mom.

And I almost died in his hands too.

My father, the sweetest man,
still doesn't know what he's done.

That's why I keep having dreams of
being choked by him.

I keep thinking
that all these deaths have to do with him.

I'm so scared... I...

Don't worry, you'll be fine.
I promise you.

Nothing's going to happen to you.

Trust me, OK?

Ki-bum.
Huh?

Let me down.

I'm sleepy.

Ki-bum,

Have you been up all night?

Did you sleep ok?

Do you recognize him?

We have to find him.
He's probably dead though.

Sun-hwa, what's the 'cut' order?

Is that her last known address?

Where is that?

Like you don't know.

What do you mean?
It's a red light district.

What?

Hey, print this out for me.

Hey, Ki-bum.

I'm with my friend, Hyung-jin.

Listen to this!

The Technician, that slime ball
lied to us.

Yoo-kyung Suh, my ass.

Her name is Yoo-mi Jung.

And you know what?
She died 20 years ago.

She was admitted here
20 years ago.

How do you remember her?

Where did you get this photo?

It's our class's cadaver.

What? Your cadaver?

Do you know who this is?

That's Yoon-ho Suh.

Yoon-ho was the most talented doctor
of us all but he didn't get

the recognition he deserved
because of people's misconceptions.

I think because of that, he took
a special interest in this woman

who was a deaf mute.

<i>He told me several times that
he was going to leave with her.</i>

<i>So when he disappeared,
I figured that he'd left with her.</i>

Yoo-mi couldn't even express herself.

I dreamt about her.

I'm so sad.

I need to be free.
I need help.

The Technician's probably the one
that removed her heart in the first place.

There's something wrong about him.

I know he's been threatening my dad.

You mean Professor Han?

Let's go search his office.

There's nothing.

What do these vengeful spirits
want from us?

We've cut open a body
that harbors an angry spirit.

Did it work?

These are hearts...

What has he been doing?

Artificial heart.

Look at this shit.

What's this?

She was here?

That asshole turned her over to us
to get rid of the corpse.

I will consider the health and
well-being of patients as my first priority.

I will practice medicine
conscientiously and with dignity.

And even under duress,

I will not use my knowledge
in an unethical manner.

You all right?

We're not immune from this.

We may someday become as ruthless
and cold-blooded as this.

Sun-hwa, you want to go find her?

Do you think anyone will remember
back that far?

Our lives depend on this,
we have to find out.

You all right?

I won't go that easily! Fuck!

She lived here 20 years ago.
Do you recognize her?

Here...

Why do I look that old?

By the way,
what happened to her 20 years ago?

Hey little sis,
what are you doing here?

No, nothing...

Not bad but could use more make-up.

Hey you!

Ki-bum, no!
Why you!

Hey!

Sun-hwa!

Sun-hwa!
Sun-hwa!

Sun-hwa!

Sun-hwa!

You gonna pay for that water you
lousy bitch?

Try having some customers that
runneth over! You lousy bitch!

Sun-hwa!

Sun-hwa!

All the men in this neighborhood are
her daddies.

Who knows which one?

She thought this was the world and
gave out to whoever,

whenever...

<i>Then one day, she resisted
a real jerk-off and he stabbed her.</i>

Hello? Yes, it's Ki-bum.

Sun-hwa is somewhere else.

Yes. What? How?
Okay, yes.

What? What happened?
Kyung-min's disappeared.

What?

Sun-hwa's father had a seizure and
while they were tending to him,

he vanished.

Fuck.

Sun-hwa's still in danger.

Where the hell is she?

Penny for your thoughts.

My dear friend!

What's up?
Got some good news?

Meeting with an old friend is
good indeed.

You, me and Yoon-ho,
we were tight.

Let's drink for old times' sake.

<i>She was so quiet and couldn't talk,</i>

<i>so I don't know
what got into her That day.</i>

<i>She was like an angry animal,
fighting all the while she was bleeding.</i>

<i>The good-for-nothing
bums here got scared and left her</i>

<i>for dead at the hospital.</i>

<i>That was her first time out
in the real world.</i>

Grab her arms, we need to move her!
Yes.

Miss, Miss!
She's bleeding too much.

Get the E.R. Ready!

I know what you're going through.

You must have thought this through,
butjust give it another minute.

Everyone in this hospital is going through
a tough time.

Calm down!

We can't let you die here.

Doctor!

<i>If what we'd heard was right,
she was better off there than here.</i>

<i>Doctors are there to treat
those who hurt.</i>

Was someone here?
The Chief.

We had a drink
since you were late.

But he left at exactly 11 PM.

Wants to spend time with the Missus.

Really?

It's been 20 years, right?

Since you and the Chief got
so much attention for inventing

the first artificial heart.

What brought this up?

Why, do you regret anything?

No, not at all.

They were the most meaningful times
as a doctor.

It takes balls to commit murder
in the name of faith.

Just what have you heard?

The Chief said so.

He said
the nightmares opened his eyes.

Nightmare? What nightmare?

This is reality, not a dream!

We did inflate the facts,
you know that.

You made me believe you'd support me!
Now you sneak behind my back...

The other side joined hands with
the engineers and had superficial success.

In a backward country like ours,
it's enough to make those

bureaucrats stand up
and make a fuss.

We don't have much time, right?

Bone saw.

What are you doing?

Give me that!

No!
Let go now!

No!
Now!

Are you all crazy?

Yoo-mi!
This is none of your business.

Bone saw.

Bring the artificial heart.

What, what's wrong?

So were you both successful?

The patient died but we found
a crucial flaw in that surgery.

That wasn't surgery.
It was an experiment.

More than a thousand lives were
saved because of her.

She was suicidal to begin with
and she was a prostitute!

One day, Yoon-ho showed me
his shriveled leg.

A disease from heaven
he can bear with as fate.

But a disease from another person is
hard to overcome and harder to cure.

My work is to help them.

They may be dead...
but there's work to be done.

This also involves your sister.

She's already dead,
this has nothing to do with her.

I know it will be hard on Sun-hwa
when she finds out the truth.

But it's better than dying for the sins
you both committed.

I'm not talking about the surgery!

Think! Doesn't Sun-hwa remind you
of someone? So smart, so sharp?

Yes, don't worry too much.

He hasn't shown up at his house.
Damn!

What's he up to?
What's he trying to do?

Kyung-min's a good guy!

It's not a matter of good or bad!

Did you ever notice anything?

Nothing before the outburst.

But why did he do that?
Do what?

Why did he have a relapse?

You think the Technician's possessed?

That's right. The way they were killed.
TThink about the sutures.

He's not the Technician for nothing.

He was the first one to encounter
the spirit of that woman!

We made history together, right?

You...

We worked so hard, right?

Professor Han!

I think faith is a tool that
supports the truth.

Is the truth what you were after
when you abandoned me to

join the engineers?

It was because of what we did.

We committed an abominable crime.

We'll see about that...

Letting the truth out now
doesn't erase the curse.

If you really have a conscience,

then you should will yourself
to die like the others did.

That asshole Han will pay for this.

I don't know about this.

What do you mean?
We're going to the classroom.

You think Sun-hwa will be there?
Of course.

And Kyung-min may show up too.

Fuck, what was the order again?

But last time, it happened
in her room.

You're starting to look like
a cadaver to me.

You think you look any better,
ass wipe?

You ready to rock and roll?

Fuck ya. Let's split up.
I'm going to the dorms this time!

Sun-hwa!

Sun-hwa! Sun-hwa! Are you OK?
Sun-hwa Min!

It's you...

It's me, Ki-bum! You'll be okay.
You'll be fine.

Do you trust me?

Yes, I trust you. I believe you.
So please get up!

No! Sun-hwa!
Open your eyes, Sun-hwa!

Get up! Sun-hwa!

Open your eyes, Sun-hwa!
Get up! Sun-hwa!

Open your eyes, Sun-hwa!
Get up! Sun-hwa!

It's over... It's over now.

<i>I didn't do it! It wasn't me!</i>

Ji-young wanted to
get out of there!

Vagus! Solius!

She was there all alone!

Deltoid! Plantaris Tendon!

You're alone too!

Sub-clauvis! Hyper-cena!

No, no, no!

I know who you're with!

Ventricle! Thorachotomy!

We're all gonna die right?
All five of us!

One! Two!

Three! Four!

Five!

Thorachotomy!

You did it!

You killed them!

Father!

Sun-hwa. Sun-hwa, please!

<i>And these people have one thing in
common. They don't remember anything</i>

<i>and they all claim that someone's
trying to choke them.</i>

<i>That's why I keep having dreams of
being choked by him.</i>

No, my father couldn't have.
He wouldn't have... That's not him.

My father is a good doctor.

Kyung-min, my father...

Date, October 27, 1985.
Sunday, 5pm.

Surgery, insertion of pace-maker
in the left ventricle

and prevention of blood clot.

Sun-hwa.

Patient name, Yoo-mi Jung.

Surgeons on call,
Ji-woo Han and Sang-hun Park.

I know that.

It wasn't easy for me either.

I always carried the burden of
what I did.

We never anticipated the outcome.
No one did.

But it's over now.
We can get over this,

right?

You'll be fine.

Everything will be okay.
Give me the papers.

Sun-hwa, do you know who I am?

I'm your...
There's two things you don't know.

First,

doctors are supposed to help people.

Second,

I am here precisely
because I am your daughter.

Sun-hwa.

You should have never had me.

I don't need a father!

<i>Why are you so good to me?</i>

<i>Because I want to.
It makes me happy.</i>

<i>You're a good person.
But I'm not good for you.</i>

<i>I don't want to make you unhappy.</i>

<i>Happiness is not easy to find.</i>

<i>It's not a goal but it is what it is.
And it isn't easy to achieve.</i>

<i>But I have it when I'm with you.</i>

<i>I have no right to love you.</i>

<i>Look at me.</i>

<i>Look at my leg.</i>

<i>I had a nightmare
last night.</i>

My heart hurts.

I need your help.

Ki-bum.

I'm sorry for not accepting you before.

I guess I didn't know how I felt.

But...

<i>But I've been waiting for this moment
to pick up the scalpel again.</i>
