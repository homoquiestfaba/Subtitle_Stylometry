 - Breakfast is on the table.

        [knock on door]

    <i> We're burning daylight.</i>

            Come on.
           Let's go.

              Zac.

         <i> - I'm coming.</i>

           [bleating]

   - We gotta get this done
         by nightfall.

           Go on now.

           [humming]

         - Mom, look.

         [hen clucking]

       <i> Look who got out.</i>

           Come here.
     <i> - I'm gonna go around</i>
           <i> this side.</i>

           [clucking]

            Come on.

     - Oh! I got you girl.
           I got you.

            Oh, yes.

       <i> Okay, watch this.</i>

       <i> - Is she asleep?</i>

       How'd you do that?

       <i> - It's a secret.</i>
       <i> I can't tell you.</i>

      - Come on. Please.
            Tell me.

            - Okay.

        The first step..

          ...is catch!

           [laughing]

      [instrumental music]

        - You finish up
         this last bit.

          - Yes, sir.

       [music continues]

      [crickets chirping]

      [instrumental music]

            <i> - Zac?</i>

             <i> Zac?</i>

       [music continues]

      <i> Where do you think</i>
        <i> they're going?</i>

         <i> - Who knows.</i>

        - I bet I could
       make it up there.

      - No way. It's dark
       and too far away.

        - You dare me?

         I bet I could.

          - Oh, yeah?
  Even if you did, then what?

        - I don't know.

           Anything.

       Meet other people.

       Maybe people like
          you and me.

     Would you go with me?

Seems like everything I need
     is already right here.

      Why would I wanna go
        someplace else?

           [gasping]

           [choking]

           [groaning]

          - Oh, God.

           [groaning]

           [choking]

            Breathe.

      Elizabeth, breathe.

           [gasping]

            [sighs]

           [panting]

        [knock on door]

           <i> Come on.</i>

    I know you two were out
          last night.

 <i> And I know you were out there</i>
   <i> doing what we all decided</i>

        <i> a long time ago</i>
  <i> would be best left behind.</i>

      Now you've gone and
     drudged up everything

   that comes along with it.

      So you can trust me
        when I tell you

        I catch you two
       doing that again..

      ...there's gonna be
        a price to pay.

       You understand me?

             - Yes.
          - Yes, sir.

            <i> - Zac.</i>

  <i> I'll need your help tending</i>
   <i> the horses this morning.</i>

Eva, you let your mother sleep.

          Come on out
   when you're done in here.

      [instrumental music]

        [birds chirping]

    <i> - This thing we have..</i>

  <i> ...we never asked for it..</i>

    <i> ...but it's part of me.</i>

      <i> It always has been.</i>

     <i> But he doesn't see it</i>
           <i> that way.</i>

      <i> What is this place?</i>

        <i> Why are we here</i>
      <i> and not out there?</i>

   <i> It's almost like a dream.</i>

         <i> I want out..</i>

       <i> ...but the wall..</i>

     <i> Dad says it's to keep</i>
       <i> other people out.</i>

    <i> But I don't believe him</i>
           <i> anymore.</i>

   <i> We're the only ones here.</i>

    <i> I think it's just meant</i>
        <i> to keep us in.</i>

       [thunder rumbling]

         - Let's pray.

       [thunder rumbling]

          - Dad? Dad?

          <i> - Mom? Mom?</i>

         - Zac, help..

           Grab her..

      Eva, pull the chair.

          <i> That's it.</i>
        <i> Hold her legs.</i>

       <i> - Get ready to..</i>

             <i> Easy.</i>

             Easy.

          <i> That's it.</i>

          <i> That's it.</i>

          [indistinct]

        <i> Nice and deep.</i>
         <i> All the way.</i>

          <i> You got it.</i>

          <i> You got it.</i>

          <i> That's it.</i>

          <i> That's it.</i>

          <i> That's it.</i>

            Alright.

            Alright.

      You're in our home.

      You had a fit, okay?

     <i> It wasn't a big one.</i>

    [footsteps approaching]

         Time for bed.

         - Is she okay?
       <i> - She'll be fine.</i>

          <i> Right now,</i>
 <i> she's gettin' ready for bed.</i>

    <i> Which is where you two</i>
      <i> should be. Come on.</i>

          I had hoped
  we'd made it past all that.

          - So did I.

     <i> - It was right before</i>
         <i> you were born.</i>

  One of those summers where..

   ...cicadas were screaming
         all day long.

    Tons of 'em everywhere.

  I used to like to catch 'em,
       keep 'em in jars.

            One day,
    I had a whole jar full.

   I went inside the kitchen
       to show mom and..

 ...she was just layin' there..

     ...shaking like that.

       I dropped the jar,
cicadas were flying everywhere.

  I kneeled down to help her..

        ...I put my hand
         on her belly..

       ...and everything
       just stood still.

     I could hear her heart
      pounding in my head.

      Everything stopped.

   And just like that, boom,
     everything went black.

     And I woke up outside
       in the front yard.

           [rattling]

           [buzzing]

     - You waitin' to see
       if I have another?

         - No. Sorry.

        - It's alright.
     You're right to worry.

          I don't know
    when it's coming either.

   But you know none of this
         is your fault.

             Right?

              Hey.

      Why don't you go out
 and run around, go for a swim?

   I can handle dinner, okay?

           - Really?
        - Yes, really.

        - Are you sure?

          - Eva, go.

              Get!

      [instrumental music]

       [music continues]

       [music continues]

      [shallow breathing]

     <i> - I don't understand.</i>

  <i> What service is she to you</i>
        <i> in this state?</i>

     <i> What do I have to do</i>
         <i> to stop this?</i>

       <i> There was a time</i>
        <i> when I thought</i>

        <i> they might be..</i>

       <i> ...gifted by you</i>
          <i> in some way</i>

   <i> with some divine purpose.</i>

           [thudding]

        <i> But I'm scared.</i>

    <i> They together might be</i>

           <i> somethin'</i>
     <i> against your desire..</i>

      <i> ...somethin' worse.</i>

    - Come on, keep goin'.

              Now!

           [laughing]

       <i> - And I am asking</i>
         <i> for your help.</i>

    <i> I'm asking for clarity.</i>

      [instrumental music]

           [creaking]

       Zac, you go ahead,
       wait in your room.

       What were you two
        doin' out there?

    - We were just playing.

            [sighs]

    - How did you get out?

  Well, you're done with this.

          Turn around.
         Face the wall.

             - Why?
       - Move. Let's go.

           - Come on.
            - Dad..

          - Come on.

            - Dad.

           [sobbing]

       - You hold still.

     <i> Don't you dare move.</i>

          [door opens]

           [sobbing]

           <i> Stand up!</i>

    I put my trust in you..

    ...and you let me down.

   <i> Get up against the wall.</i>

             <i> Get!</i>

         - I'm sorry..

        - Be still now.

   - I'm gonna talk to Eva,
       we're not gonna..

        <i> - Goddamn you.</i>

          [hammering]

         [Zac grunting]

    - Dad, I'm sorry. Dad!

        Stupid. Stupid.
        Stupid! Stupid!

        <i> Eva, we're not</i>
      <i> doing this anymore!</i>

           [sobbing]

       [heavy breathing]

           [groaning]

            <i> - Eva?</i>

             <i> Zac?</i>

          [door opens]

            [groans]

         Are you okay?

         - I hate him.
           - I know.

     - I hate him so much.
  - I know. He's just scared.

     I have to go help Eva.

            [groans]

    This won't happen again.

        - I'm so sorry.

      - No, you didn't do
        anything wrong.

           I'm sorry.

           [sniffles]

           [rattling]

    What is wrong with you?

            [sighs]

          What are you
     trying to teach them?

           Answer me.

   They're children, Daniel.

     They're our children.
   - They're more than that.

       - Yes, they are.

     But that doesn't mean
 you can treat them like that.

     No one deserves this.

  - What am I supposed to do?

       They don't listen.

   And it's starting to take
     its toll on all of us.

    - I know you're scared.

        I'm scared too.
         I'm horrified.

   I might be leaving you all
  sooner than I ever imagined.

       - Don't you talk
       like that. Please!

     Do not talk like that.
       - It's the truth!

 And it has absolutely nothing
        to do with them!

    - I will let them down
   when I am good and ready.

       - I already did.

         - Elizabeth.

           Elizabeth!

           [grunting]

        - Are you okay?

       - We can't, Eva.

      - What do you mean?

     - It's not worth it.
  We have to do what he says.

You'll get over it. Come on.

      - Eva, I'm serious.

            - Fine.

  - Come on, get out of here.
           Let's go.

            - Hey.

            - Hey.

       - I was thinking
     about goin' swimming.

  - That's nice, but I can't.

        - Zac, come on.

         - What, Eva?

      - You're just gonna
        live like this?

            Come on.

      - I got work to do.
         - Seriously?

              Zac!

     - I'm done with this.

   I'm not doing that again.

        - You alright?

        [bird chirping]

 Did you fall out of your nest?

      - I really believed
    we could make something.

            I mean..

     ...could make a life.

  Live the way we wanna live.

          Raise the..

        ...kids, the way
      we wanna raise kids.

     - This is everything
         I ever feared.

 <i> All those stories were true.</i>

          <i> It's hard.</i>

           [sniffles]
 - Your children aren't trying

 to make loving them difficult.

      All they ever wanted
        was to be loved.

       They're children.

          [whispering]
            - Zac?

              Zac?

         [mellow music]

           [gasping]

          - Shh, shh.

    Alright, I'm right here.

              Hey.

             Okay.

 <i> I need you to breathe for me.</i>

        Breathe for me.
         Come on, now.

         Come on, now.
      You breathe for me.

            Come on.

     Come on, now. Don't..

           Elizabeth.

       Come on. Breathe.

           Elizabeth.

         You got this.

           [sobbing]
   You can do that. Come on.

            [crying]

      - What's going on?

        - Your mother..

       - What happened?

   - Where's your sister at?

        - I don't know.
     She's not in her room?

 - Zac, I need you to go ahead
     and get in the closet.

            - Why?

 - I can't do this right now.

          <i> You go on.</i>

  <i> We can talk about it later.</i>

          - Hey, dad.

   Hey, dad! What's goin' on?

   - You go ahead and close
      the door behind you.

             Go on.

         - What is it?

         - She's gone.

             Stop.
    - I wanna be with her.

    - I should've done this
        a long time ago.

  Don't make this any harder.

   Get away from that window.

           [grunting]

           <i> Come on.</i>

          <i> - Eva! Eva!</i>

           <i> Eva! Eva!</i>

           [thudding]

 <i> What's going on? Let me out!</i>

      [instrumental music]

       [music continues]

           [panting]

           [pounding]

   <i> What do you want from me?</i>

       <i> What do you want?</i>

        [Zac screaming]

      [instrumental music]

       [music continues]

          [inaudible]

       [music continues]

           <i> - I fear</i>
      <i> for your soul, Eva.</i>

       [music continues]

          [footsteps]

           <i> Zac! Zac!</i>

    <i> Let go or your fingers</i>
      <i> are coming with it.</i>

   <i> Now you gotta be thirsty,</i>
     <i> so do not spill this.</i>

           <i> Come on.</i>

           <i> Good boy.</i>

  <i> Oh, it's gonna be different</i>
           <i> now, Zac.</i>

     <i> It's gonna be better.</i>

        - You're gonna
       be okay, sweetie.

  Everything's gonna be okay.

      [instrumental music]

       [machine beeping]

         - I'm sorry.

       - There you are.

        Are you alright?

           It's okay.
    I'm not gonna hurt you.

  Let's see if we can get you
       back to your room.

       - Don't touch me.

         - It's okay.

    John...I need help here.

      [instrumental music]

          [footsteps]

     <i> - I hope that by now</i>
      <i> what you're feeling</i>

    <i> is something different</i>
          <i> than anger.</i>

        [door unlocking]

    <i> You can go ahead and..</i>

     <i> ...clean yourself up</i>
       <i> and come on out..</i>

   <i> ...whenever you're ready.</i>

      [breathing heavily]

        - Where is Eva?

      - She's gone, Zac.

        <i> - Where is she?</i>

     - I took care of her.

     They're both at peace.

      - What do you mean?

    <i> - You know what I mean.</i>

         - You didn't.

    - Go see for yourself.

      [instrumental music]

       [music continues]

           [sobbing]

        - You're awake.

        Are you alright?

   We were worried about you.

           I'm Jamie.

            That's..

 ...Frank and Paul over there.

       They're good guys.
           I promise.

      You feeling better?

          Listen, uh..

      ...I saw that thing
         on your wrist.

           It's okay.

     I'm not trying to pry.

     We didn't call nobody.

        You looked like
   you were gonna be alright.

           We figured
     you had your reasons.

  So I decided to wait and see
   if you wanted help or not.

          - I'm okay.

          - Alright.

           I getcha.

        I've been there.

  We don't have to call nobody
      unless you want to.

     You just let me know.

           - Thanks.
    I appreciate your help.

       - You're welcome.

 Come on over and sit with us.

  <i> You don't have to run off.</i>

         [guitar music]

       Â¶ When you finally
        start dreamin' Â¶

   Â¶ And everyone can tell Â¶

      Â¶ Close your eyes Â¶

     Â¶ Let you drift away Â¶

        Â¶ I'll make sure
       you feel better Â¶

      Â¶ With the stillness
        that you know Â¶

         Â¶ From a time
  when you still had a million
             days Â¶

    - He's good, isn't he?

     Â¶ Be true to yourself
    through and through.. Â¶

       You look just like
        my daughter does

      when the TV'd be on.

     Starin' there, frozen.

      I'd do little dances
      in front of the set

      and she'd just lean
      her little body over

      till she could see.

  Â¶ Keep love in your heart Â¶

   Â¶ Until the day you die Â¶Â¶Â¶

            Get up.
            - What?

           - Get up.
        - What is that?

   - It's the cops. Damn it!
             - No.

         - I was just
      getting comfortable.

      - Ah, shit. Again?
        These assholes.

You think we should book it?

       <i> - I sure as hell</i>
          <i> ain't gonna</i>

         <i> cut my ass up</i>
     <i> climbing out of here.</i>

          Unless this
     one's done somethin'.

    - I didn't do anything.
          <i> - You sure?</i>

          - I promise
     I did not do anything.

       <i> - What's goin' on</i>
       <i> down here, people?</i>

   - Y'all are not supposed
        to be down here.

    - Just the four of ya?

  - Well, yeah. It's just us.

   - Alright. Step outside.
            Come on.

         What the hell?

      [instrumental music]

            <i> - Why?</i>

    <i> Why would he blame us?</i>

   <i> What makes him so afraid?</i>

          <i> What is it?</i>

       [music continues]

 <i> Mom always saw it as a gift.</i>

      <i> She never doubted.</i>

       <i> But he's scared..</i>

         <i> ...and weak.</i>

 <i> I don't know how he can live</i>
         <i> with himself.</i>

     I wanna make him feel
          what I feel.

    [song playing on radio]

    - Hey, you got a light?

           - A what?

          - Figured.

    <i> Say, you have a lighter</i>
          <i> I can bum?</i>

      So what's your deal?

      You just move here?
      Run away from home?

             What?

        - I don't live
    with my family anymore.

          - No shit.

  Me and this dingus just got
           yanked out

      of our parents house
      again the other day.

          > How come?

   - My mom can't stay clean
    long enough to have some

dumbshit walk through our house

tell us if it's livable or not.

        Which it isn't,
   but that's not the point.

    - My dad threw me out.

      - You got any place
            to stay?

       - No, not really.

 - Well, you can hang with me
            tonight.

 Then I can see if you can come
  to the girl's home with me.

    They feed you at least.

           Just come.

          - Alright.

  - Okay, well, let me begin

         by explaining
       what I'm here for.

   <i> All the girls here, Eva,</i>

have their -- their own stories

     as how they got here.

       And I would guess
     that yours is similar

       <i> to most of them.</i>

      <i> Now Danny tells me,</i>
          <i> Eva, that..</i>

         - It's E-va.

            <i> - E-va.</i>

    Danny tells me that you
  didn't have a place to stay.

 So we're happy to provide that
  for you for a little while.

           You know,
     this is a safe place.

      <i> Everything that you</i>
   <i> and I talk about in here</i>

      <i> it'll stay between</i>
          <i> you and me.</i>

            - Okay.

           <i> - Great.</i>

         <i> Why don't we</i>

           start with

       where you're from.

      - W-what about it?

  <i> - Well, Danny tells me that</i>

   <i> she met you around town.</i>

  <i> Have you always lived here?</i>

        <i> Did you grow up</i>
        <i> somewhere else?</i>

       - Somewhere else.

  - So how'd you end up here?

    - I ran away from home.

 - That's a very brave thing,
              Eva.

       New places can be
       very intimidating

    especially on your own.

 Why don't we talk a little bit
         about the home

    that you ran away from?

  Who did you live there with?

            - Um..

    My brother and my father

        and...my mother.

        [dramatic music]

    <i> - Are they still there?</i>

      [music intensifies]

             <i> Eva?</i>

   <i> Are they all still there?</i>

            - Yes.

      - Gets any colder,
  we're gonna have to chop up

        some more wood.

    You know, you gonna have
   to talk to me eventually.

     You can't keep talking
    to that horse everyday.

  - What is that you want me
            to say?

          - Anything.

       Whatever you want,
    whatever's on your mind.

       Might make things
       better between us.

     - In the end...like,

   they start, like, spending
  more and more time together

  but he starts getting weaker
          and weaker.

      [indistinct chatter]

   So then, he, like, dies..

      - She's doing a lot
         of things now.

     Uh, she like to dance
           or play or

       she loves singing.

         And she's as..

          [indistinct]

 - Who the hell does she think
            she is?

     Nobody even likes her.

       Well, just 'cause
       our families' here

     doesn't mean anything.

  <i> - Okay, girls. Goodbye hug</i>
 <i> and let's line up at the door.</i>

          <i> Hustle up.</i>

            <i> Come on.</i>
       - What the hell?

         Get off of me!
        - Danny! Danny!

  - Get off of her. Stop it!

       - Just ignore her.
 - What the hell do you know?

       Your dad threw you
        out on your ass.

   - I'm just tryin' to help.
   - I don't need your help.

     I don't need anybody's
         fuckin' help!

           - Enough!

        [dramatic music]

      [music intensifies]

        [dramatic music]

        [birds chirping]

          [footsteps]

     - I know you're upset

       about everything.

        I'm upset, too.

   Son, I don't think you got
       the full picture.

  Look, when I was your age..

  ...I struggled to understand
          this place.

     Walk along that wall.

            Wonder..

     ...what it all meant.

       <i> I plagued my dad</i>
        <i> with questions.</i>

 <i> He told me stories about your</i>
      <i> great-grandparents,</i>

  <i> their kin and their friends</i>
    <i> who claimed this land.</i>

   Their community had been..

         ...fractured,
    had been destroyed by..

    ...unexplained deaths..

       ...disappearances,
    sometimes it's children.

     <i> Tore families apart.</i>

  <i> Having theirs, they -- they</i>
   <i> came here trying to make</i>
        <i> a fresh start.</i>

    <i> And now we are the ones</i>
         <i> that remain.</i>

      Oh, when I was a kid

    those stories filled me
         full of fear.

  But as time went on, I grew.

  Life was...normal, orderly.

<i>Then your mother and I started</i>
<i>talking about having children.</i>

   <i> Those stories came back.</i>

         <i> I was scared.</i>

       And your mother..

     ...she said they were
          just stories

    they were just folklore.

       And you were born.

          And you were
    a happy, healthy child.

       We were so happy.

       Few years went by.

    And then along came Eva.

             And..

  ...things started happening.

   Your mother fell ill and..

    And we...been struggling
          ever since.

        - It amazes me.

  <i> And after everything you've</i>
     <i> done to this family.</i>

   That you can sit in here..

    ...and talk, and talk..

      - Zac, I'm telling
         you the truth.

         I'm not saying
    I'm without fault here.

    I'm not. But I need you
         to understand.

  - Understand how delusional
            you are?

          - Not to..
      Sit down. Sit down!

  - You want me to understand
      for you killing Eva!

         - Zac, stop!

    I need you to calm down.
         Listen to me.

    I need you to understand
           something.

    I will never forgive you
        for killin' Eva.

    I need you to understand
      who I think you are

  and what you are capable of.

        - Let go of me.

          - Zac, Zac,
      what are you doing?

            Zac, no!

      What are you doing?

           [grunting]

           [panting]

           [panting]

        I'm sorry, son.

        [intense music]

       [music continues]

           [panting]

        [birds chirping]

        [intense music]

         [music stops]

        [dramatic music]

   <i> - I always wondered what</i>
 <i> it would be like without him.</i>

       Part of me thought
   it would feel kinda good,
           you know?

        I keep thinking
    I'm gonna see you wave.

        When I wake up..

    ...when I turn around..

          You and mom.

 Even dad, if you believe that.

     But I know that isn't
         gonna happen.

    I'm just gonna have to..

  ...learn to live with that.

        [dramatic music]

        [wind whooshing]

           [rumbling]

      [instrumental music]

            <i> - Zac!</i>

            <i> - Eva?</i>

           [sobbing]

        - Goodbye, mom.

           Thank you.

              Hey.

      [instrumental music]

         I've an idea.

Â¶ I'm the king of my own land Â¶

  Â¶ Facing tempests of dust Â¶

  Â¶ I'll fight until the end Â¶

    Â¶ Creatures of my dreams
           raise up Â¶

     Â¶ And dance with me Â¶

      Â¶ Now and forever Â¶

       Â¶ I'm your king Â¶Â¶Â¶
