of the dance team.

That's who I'm tryin' to mess with.
Oh, that one girl?

She's super.

(tapping on window)
Oh, yeah, that's her.

See? She already peeping.

What's up, Legs?

GIRL:
No, I ain't scared of...

GROUP: â™ª I ain't scared of
lions and tigers and bears â™ª

GIRL: Nah!

Here comes that little tomboy.

Oh, we back in.

â™ªâ™ª (stereo: woman singing,
indistinct)

BOY:
You comin'?

Easy, girl.

(vacuum whirring)

You ready to go home?
Let me lock up.

Lionesses! Lionesses!
Don't mess! Lionesses!

(shouting continues)

(man shouts)

GIRL: Donte's showing
off for you.

(girls laughing)

(shouting in distance)

(cheering in distance)

(cheering continues)

Hey. Ready to go
hit these stairs?



Keep going.

Throw right here. Wide.
Throw it wide. Wide.

Nope. Straight.

I saw you dancing earlier.

I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

I don't know.

Well, the only way
you can lose a fight...

If you don't get in the ring.

Remember that.

Okay?
All right? Okay?

â™ªâ™ª (percussion)

â™ªâ™ª (continues)


â™ªâ™ª (woman singing, indistinct)


WOMAN: All right.

Let's see what
the new girls can do.

Crabs, on the floor.

Hey, Guns.
We're Crabs.

If you're gonna show up,
just know, there's work to do.

We expect you here for three-hour
practices three times a week.

At home, practice.
At school, practice.

Stop thinking like an individual
and start thinking like a team.

This...
is your family now.

We've won the citywide competition
the last four years in a row.

If any of you Crabs
can't keep up,

we'll have to ask you to go.

Let's start easy
with the clap back call.

Stand at attention.

Drop your arms.

Hands on your hips.

The moves are...

step, around, step, step.

Around, out.
Up, cut, up.

Back, back, back, back.
Snatch.

Punch, punch.
Around, down.

Step, step.
Around, punch.

Five, six, seven.

Go. Step, around.
Step, step.

Around, out.
Up, cut, up.

Back, back, back, back.
Snatch.

Punch, punch.
Around, down.

Step, step.
Around, punch.

Five, six, seven, eight.

Step, around.
Step, step.

Around, out.
Up, cut, up.

Back, back, back, back.
Snatch.

Punch, punch.
Around, down.

Step, step.
Around, punch.


That's enough of that.
Everyone on the floor.

You Crabs look a mess.
You better start practicing.

Are you ready?
Cue the music.

(laughing, chattering)

Anyways, so, what up
with you and Donte?

Donte is Donte.
He's disgusting.

But you were just so in
love, like, a week ago.

Yeah.
That was a week ago.

Thoughts change
and people change.

I bought this top a week ago,

and I don't even
like it anymore.

But how have you been feeling?

I got sick in class earlier.

Really?
Yeah, I had to leave.

So... are you
gonna tell him?

I don't know.
Would you?

All he cares about is boxing.

I wouldn't trust guys like that.

What is that supposed to mean?

He's Donte.
He does what he wants.

Yeah, but what about
what I want?

Can I use the sink?

Not now.

Bitch.

(lock unlatches)

(laughter, chatter)

(girl laughing)


It's gonna be simple as that.
Plain blue and black.

And then, say, you got your
"Queen City" on the back of that?

It's just gonna say...
It's just gonna say my name.

Mine might just be my initials on mine.
That's it?

It's gonna be like my trunks.

Simple. Feel me? People understand.
Like, they'll know.

He knows everything.

By the time... By the time we're
about to go out of town,

they should be shipping in, 'cause
them'll take five to eight.

Dang. I didn't even know you was coming.
It's okay.

I seen you up
there dancing, Tiny.

You need to tell your friends to
come turn up with us. - Man, shut up.

Lionesses be like,
"I know how it go, man."

Hey. Hey.

Hey, hey.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Hey, hey.
Oh, man.

He's outtie.

Your girl's here.

He better hold that down.

Probably don't even
know what he did.

What's up, Bae?

You gonna do me
like that though?

LEGS: I told you I wanted you
to go to the clinic with me.

You and this clinic stuff.
You're trippin'.

You're coming with me right now.

So now you're trying
to call me a ho?

You know what, Donte? Just get out. Go
ahead. Go with your little friends.

You acting stupid.
Go ahead. Go eat your pizza.

What you staring at?

(grunting softly)

(door opens)

Hey. Toni, right?

Yeah.

Maine's little sister?

Yeah.

Mind filling these up
for me before practice?

Sure.


Hey, Guns.
You got a tattoo yet?

It's Toni.

Yeah, but you got the muscles.

Let's give her the flower one.

This good?

I guess.

I'm Beezy, by the way. And
that's Maia, Legs' sister.

Should be ready.

Hands go up!

ALL:
Mouths go shut.

We should be
practicing right now.

Y'all want to do
a set of stairs?

ALL: No.

Sorry, Coach. I just... I
need to get some water.

COACH: All right. Let's start
with the clap back stand.

GIRL: Let's go!

Everyone spread out.

Face forward.

We're gonna go over stand three.

COACH:
One more week, ladies.

One.

Keep going.

Do it again.
Five, six, seven. Go.

Do it again. Five, six, seven.
Go. Come on, ladies!

One.

Do it again.

Five, six, seven. Go.

One.

Do it again.
Five, six, seven. Go.

Step. Go harder.


Is she okay?

Somebody call 911!

COACH:
Somebody get her water!


I heard from Maia. They're
keeping Legs overnight.

Do they know what happened?
She didn't say.

You got a ride?
Yeah. I got a ride.

(switches clicking)

(girls chattering)

Think she's gonna be back
for competition?

I used to. I'm sure Legs
has that on lockdown.

Don't you think we
should... I can do it.

Legs taught me her stand
routines the other day.

I can handle it, Diamond.
Don't mess!

GIRLS: Lionesses. Watch
me for the new steps.

The count's to eight.
Five, six, seven, eight.

GIRL: April? April!
GIRL #2: I like the blue.

Hips?
Thirty-five.

Bust?
Thirty-two.

Pants?
Double zero.

Waist?
Twenty-eight.

Latonia? Latonia.

Girl, you're straight as a nail.

Waist?
Twenty-three.

Pants?
Twelve.

You're so skinny.
Turn around.

Next!

125?
125?

I think you're like 132. You're
probably seven pounds over.

I was fighting 130.

I gotta lose five pounds
for this weekend.

Let me grab my stuff,
then we can go home.

Yeah. She in the hospital.
She was going crazy.

But me and her?
We're through.

How's your sister? Good. She just
came back from the hospital.

That was so scary. Karisma's freaking out!
April just texted me!

Come on! Come on!
Let's go see what it is!

(girl screaming)

(screaming continues)

GIRL: Call 911!

Call 911!



MAINE:
You girls crazy.

Yeah, but today Karisma had the
same thing happen. And the twins.

Karisma is the crazy one
out of all of them.

Don't start acting like her.

Ew. How can something
even smell that nasty?

At least the girls' stuff
never smelled that bad.

Look.

I busted Donte's nose.

What?
He's gonna kill you.


So, do you work here?

No. I'm just
helping my brother.

Oh. Did you know they didn't
come to school today?

Yeah.
That's pretty crazy.

You gonna stay on the team?

I don't know yet.

I think you should. I don't
think they can kick you off.

Even if we're really bad?
You're not the worst.

(clicks tongue)

Bah!

(rhythmic clapping)

â™ªâ™ª (humming)

COACH: We've all been under
a lot of stress lately.

Legs and Karisma are both
home and doing much better.

Diamond has a card going around,

so make sure y'all sign it in the
locker room before you leave today.

I know we have a
competition coming up,

but I've decided it's better for
everyone to take the day off.

I know, I know!

So sorry, ladies.

Practice is canceled for today.

Uniforms are in, and we can
pass them out on Friday.

(footsteps approaching)

Hey, Toni,
don't you live over there?

Yeah. Why?

You gonna walk home?

My brother's finishing up the laundry.
I gotta wait for him.

Oh, yeah. I gotta wait
here for Lorraine.

Hey! Can you show me
how to do a pull-up?

Sure.

It's really easy.

Start with your arms like this.

Make sure you got a good grip.

Use your stomach.
I am!

No, tighter.

Ow.

Now, imagine there's a huge rope
pulling you up. Not you, but the rope.

What?

Starting your own boxing gym?
Just waiting for you.

If you helped me out, we could
have been out here earlier.

Can I wait with Beezy till she gets
picked up? Her ride's running late.

Pretty please?

All right. I don't want
you out here by yourself.

Huh.

If Mama call, let her know
I'll be cooking dinner.

Call before you leave.


Shh. Shh!

Shh!



It's perfect. (whispers)
Grab a second one.

(clicks tongue)



Stop.

Let me hear you say.

Lionesses. Lionesses.
Don't mess. Lionesses.

In stride, one pride.
Lionesses. Lionesses.

Pride takes the prey.
Let me hear you say.

Lionesses. Lionesses.
Don't mess. Lionesses.

In stride. One pride.
Lionesses. Lionesses.

Take the prey.
Let me hear you say.

<i>Lionesses. Lionesses.
Don't mess. Lionesses.</i>



Shh! Do you hear that?

I think someone's in here.


Toni! This isn't funny.

Toni.

Boo!

(liquid dribbles)
Ew! Beezy!

Please don't tell.

You think Legs and them
are really okay?


I don't know.

Think it's contagious?

Probably.

Maybe it's some kind of...
boyfriend disease?

(water trickles)

I'm fine though.

Yeah.

Me too.

I just want to compete.

Yeah. I'm sure
somebody'll figure it out.


You won't tell, right?
I won't.

(uniform clicks in dryer)

WOMAN (faint):
To our captains...


We are doing everything we can. We think
it may actually be in the water system.

Well, we've been drinking the
water for, like, forever.

Well, we'll deal with this and do some
tests and hold a press conference.

What I really want
to know right now is...

Tell me what these episodes
are like for you.

Well, I had mine first and...

There's a possibility these episodes have
been caused by unsafe water in the building.

So don't drink
out of the water fountains.

We'll be having a sample
tested soon.

So for now, just use
the boxing gym.

There's a water cooler
in there that is safe.

Also, since your captains have been sick, we
had to drop out of this weekend's competition.

(all groan)

However, however,

you can try on your uniforms and
start practicing for the parade.

(scattered clapping)

It's okay? You can
take it from here?

Uniforms.

Five, six, seven, eight.


GIRL: What's your name?
(chattering)

Why won't you let me watch you dance?
Because.

Don't you have a boxing tournament?
It's in... two weeks.

Oh. Well,
I'll let you know.


Move.

(clicks tongue)
So you with them now?

Yeah.

Five, six... Let's get
back to practice, ladies.

You was all, like, boom.
And boom. (chuckles)

Let's practice parade.

We can practice right here.
Okay.

Five, six... Five, six, seven.

Maia.

Stay on beat. Five, six...
Five, six, seven, eight.

Toni, this is parade.
You have to smile.

Five, six, seven.

(chattering on TV)

MAN: <i>You know, there's something
awfully screwy about this.</i>

<i>Or my name isn't Larimore!</i>

(continues, indistinct)

(ice clatters) ELMER FUDD:<i> Sorry
I had to plug you, Mr. Duck.</i>

<i>But I'm a sportsman. A great,
great sportsman.</i> (chuckles)

You're growing up fast,
lil' Legs.

Where'd you get those?
From a friend.

You gonna do this or what?

How long do I have to hold the ice on for?
Till it feels numb.

I think it's okay.
(flicks lighter)

Okay.

This was your idea.


Toni, you're crazy. I can't
believe you didn't scream.

Here you go.

Do I put them in now?



I don't... think
I can do the other one.

I can do it.

Ready?

(door opens)

MAINE:
You ready? Come on.

How the girls doing?
Fine.

Fine?
That's it?

Aw, Mama gonna kill me. Where
you get some money from?

I did it myself.
Give 'em to me. Now.

They're mine.

You know what?

You're on your own when we go home.
You're on your own.


Are you sure you did it right?
Yes.

Boom.
Are you positive, Beezy?

I'm positive.
I bet you were cryin'.

No, she didn't even scream.
I did.

You screamed?
But it wasn't you.

Yeah, but it was scary.


Oh, I got moves.
Let's go.

I want to see this.
I want to see this.

BEEZY: They're cute.
GIRL: Thank you.

Are they real?

Get back. What!

GIRLS: Ooh!

GIRL: Turn, turn.

YOUNG GIRL: You do it.
Dance, Ley Ley.


Hot Sauce. Come on, girl.
You can do better.

Shake! Put the peanut
butter on that butter.

REPORTER:
<i>seizure-like symptoms.</i>

<i>Some of the girls have even
been hospitalized.</i>

<i>But health officials have
yet to release a diagnosis.</i>

<i>West End residents fear the illness
may be caused by contaminated water.</i>

<i>City officials say they are working with the
county health department to investigate.</i>

<i>In the meantime, the community center is
only using bottled water for drinking.</i>

<i>That's an attempt to curb what
residents are calling "the fits."</i>

<i>We'll keep an eye on the story.</i>

Come on! Faster!


Faster. Faster.

Faster. Faster.
Faster. Faster.

(girls talking, indistinct) Faster.
Faster. Faster. Faster.

KARISMA: Channel 12 keeps calling
to see if I'll do an interview.

DIAMOND: They didn't call me.
LEGS: It doesn't matter.

We're not gonna be interrogated
on live television. Psst!

DIAMOND: They don't believe us.

LEGS:
Let 'em think what they want.

Hey, K, are you still shaking?

Sometimes when I wake up.

DIAMOND: So what was it like?
GIRL: Yeah, how did it feel?

Come on!
Shh!

Actually, it's kind of
like competition.

When you're really nervous
right before the performance,

and you kinda
forget the choreography?

I mean, well,
your body knows it, but...

I don't know. It's like you
almost just stop thinking.

It's like time stops,
and you're just floating.

(continues, indistinct)


(door closes)

Other hand.

We were all just in the locker
room, and Madison went crazy.

What do you mean, crazy?

She started shaking
all over the place.

Was the whole team there?
Pretty much.

You guys talkin' about Madison?

It was crazy.
She was like... (grunts)

And her eyes was like...

And then her tongue was like...

She dropped to the floor,
was shakin' a lot.

Shaking. Shaking.
She twisted for a little time.

Twist. She got like that
and then like that.

And then, zombie.

She was, like, choking
and a zombie so she was like,

bleh-bleh, bleh-bleh.

Blah, blah-blah. (chokes) Choking.

And then she was doing it again.
Spinning around.

It was live.
Everyone's getting sick.

Pretty much all the older girls.

Maia, can you do mine?

Yeah.
Give me your hand.

He's filling up a container!

They look like astronauts!


I can't breathe.

LEGS: Is that Kira?
KARISMA: She's in the kitchen!


Shh. Shh.

Breathe in. Breathe out. Are
you just gonna stand there?

It'll be okay. Breathe in. Breathe out.

(stick rattles)

Hey.
Hey.

You okay?

Just thinking about everything.
Yeah.

Are you nervous?

About the parade?

You know it's gonna
happen to us.

Just thinking about what
my sister said, you know?

What do you mean?

I just... I just want
to know how it feels.

Aren't you scared?

Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
It'll happen to us anyway.

It hasn't happened
to any of the boys.

Yeah, but we're not them.

LEGS: Maia!

Coming!
See ya.

(ball bouncing)

(vacuum whirring)

(whirring stops)

MAINE: You know I just got done vacuuming.
What's up with you these days?


One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

COACH: All right! Lookin'
good, ladies. (sighs)



(chattering echoes)

(all gasp)

Maia.

Maia. Maia.

Maia. Maia.

Do you think we should
go see if Maia's okay?

I don't care. What do you
mean, you don't care?

Maia wanted it to happen to her.

Huh?

I don't want it to happen to me.

You've been drinking the water.
You still think it's that?

What do you know about it?

What do you know about anything?

I'll tell Maia you said hi.

What are you trying to do?
Break your wrist?

What do you care?

Dang, dancing must've
really got you weak.

Girl...

Dang. Hold up.

Come on now, Tone. What's wrong?

I'm scared.

Scared?

Scared of what?
It's all in your mind.

Trust me.
They gonna get better.

(breathing deeply)

(breathing deeply)

(breathing deeply)

COACH: Everyone! Please! Ladies!

WOMAN: Which is why I'll be talking
with your daughters today,

discussing what's happening
in their lives,

trying to see if there's any warning
signs that may have caused all this.

Any patterns.

Like I said, I'm still
doing my degree.

WOMAN (shouting):
Is it the water or not?

WOMAN #2: I did read the report
that came from the city.

There is nothing wrong with the water
in this building. It is safe to drink.

Have you gotten sick yet?

No.


BEEZY:
Where are your earrings?

They were infected.


Last time I came on my period...

Bianca?

Your turn. GIRL: I don't want
to talk to her about that.


WOMAN (shouts):
Help! Help! Help!

Somebody help, please!


You think it'll happen again?

I don't know why everyone's making
such a big deal out of it. I'm fine.

It was crazy though. It was
like watching it from above,

like I had two sets of eyes.

Was yours like that, Maia?

No. Mine was,
like, serene.

What's that mean?
Peaceful.

It didn't look peaceful. It looked scary.
Did mine look scary?

I didn't see.

WOMAN: Bianca?
That's me.

Your foster mom gave me a call.
How you feelin'?

She's feeling better.

That's good. You think you
can get yourself to the car?

You're good.

Feeling better, Beez? What
do you know about it?

(car door opens, closes)



(pulse quickens)

(pulse slows)

GIRL: Mine? It was... (imitates
popping) Like pop rocks.

Really? Mine was terrifying. Like I
never want to go through that again.

Mine must've
happened in my room.

My mom came in, my teddy
bears were everywhere.

y'all see Legs?

She was still twitching at the meeting.

(chattering, giggling)


(punches landing)

Get this hand.
This hand.

Step back.
(hits landing)

Keep workin'.

Slip, slip.
