(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Shh! She can hear us.

Who?
Your mother!

Every year, she tears
the house apart

looking for her
anniversary present!

She's consumed by
the thrill of the hunt
and won't stop until...

(THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS)


(TEETH CHATTERING)

(FOOTSTEPS DEPARTING)

BOTH: Phew!


Hello, boys!
Just tidying up!


Okay.
Where is it?

No idea what you're
talking about, darling.

I'm just having
a conversation
with our son.

Hmm. Well, see
you at brekkie.

See? She's relentless!

Just once, I'd like
to surprise your mother.

She always finds it!

You've gotta help me hide
your mom's present!

It's a big
responsibility, Kick.
Can you handle it?

Of course, Dad. I'll...


MOM: Where is it?
Why is there so much junk
in this house?

I'll never find my...
I mean, still cleaning!

She'll never
stop looking!

MAN ON RADIO:
<i>The Mellowbrook Swap Meet!</i>

<i>Bring your old junk,
swap for new junk,</i>

<i>or just get Mom
out of the house.</i>

That's a great idea!
Thanks, radio!

I'll take her to
the Swap Meet!

She might not stop looking
for her gift, but she sure
won't find it!

I'm entrusting you with
this responsibility.
Now hide it well, Kick!

Present!

(CERAMICS SHATTERING)

Ah-ha!

There.
Good luck finding that.

Be gone, lowly peasant!

I've come to rescue
young Betsy from
her dungeon chamber.

Yeah, yeah, have fun.

Hey, Kick, thanks
for taking care
of that thing.

While I'm gone,
why don't you sit
in my chair?

Wow. Really?

Okay, dear.
Let's get swapping!

Where is my present!

Come on now, hon.
Or we'll miss all
the good swapping.

Be good, kids!

Hey! How come you get
to sit in Dad's chair?

Totally saved
Mom and Dad's
anniversary.

Dad asked me to
hide Mom's present.

You? But that was my job!

Yeah, Brad.

Yeah, Brad.

Yeah, Brad.

It was your job, Brad.
And you got fired.

I let Dad down.
And now you're gonna
get all the glory!

Okay, dillweed.
Where'd you hide it?

Save it, Brad. I'm a rock.
I'm not telling you...

Quiet! It's Burping
Betsy's nap time!

Tell me where Mom's present
is or the board gets it!

Old Blue! Whoa!

Okay, fine!

It's inside a baby doll,
inside a violin case,
inside a baby carriage!

You mean the baby carriage
that's inside Dad's car?

Yes, the baby carriage
that's inside Dad's car!

They're gonna swap
Mom's necklace!

Dad's never gonna
trust me again!

Like he doesn't
trust you!


that necklace, dillweed!

And get back Dad's trust!

Yeah, redemption!

Huh?

Empty.

Can't let Dad see me.

(CLEARS THROAT)
Hello, kind sir.

I am looking for a doll
inside a violin case
inside a baby carriage.

Oh, I wish I could
help you, buddy.

But I just swapped
my last one

for this nifty
microcassette recorder!

Note to self. Invest in more
doll/violin/carriage combos.

Hey! Stop that!

Gotta find the doll
before Brad.


I win, Brad.


Aw, biscuits.

Excuse me, ma'am,
where'd you get
this carriage?

Some dreadful man dressed
like a mall cop.

Where's the violin case
that was in the carriage?

Pretty sharp board
you got there...

It's not for swapping.
Where's the violin case?

Sorry, bub. I don't
start talking till
you start swapping.

DAD: (ECHOING) <i>It's a big</i>
<i>responsibility, Kick.</i>

<i>Sure you can handle it?</i>

<i>Sit in my chair.
My chair... My chair!</i>

Stay alive. I'll be back.

Now where's the violin case?

Swapped it to Magnus.


Thanks for the tip,
dillweed! (LAUGHS)

Mr. Magnuson!
Who has the violin case?

Bwar! Boy in black
swapped it for his heart.

He say he not
using it anyways.

Emo Kid.


DAD: This way, dear.

They're heading home.
I've got to find that doll.

I left something really
important in there.

I just need
to look inside.

Come on. Hurry up!


Like my dreams.

There it is.

I saved the day.
Love me, Father!

Give me the necklace,
you crazy doll.

KICK: Ha! That's not it.
The doll in the basement
wasn't in a box.

That doll was mint condition.
In its original box.

It's worth more than all
these others combined.

I've never even pulled
the string to make her talk!

<i>I'm Burping Betsy!</i> (BURPS)

(BETSY BURPS)

Quiet!
It's Burping Betsy's nap time!


I know where the doll is!


Not so fast. You're gonna
have to pay for this doll.

Uh, uh, can you
break a thousand?

Oh! Why, of course.

Brad Bucks?
BRAD: Yeah, Brad.

Take them all.
I need this board.

Present! Present! Present!

Brianna, have
you seen Kick?


Burping Betsy!
You're sick!

Yes!

Yes!

Yes. This'll pay for the doll.

Ooh, and this, too.

Wait! Can't we swap
the doll for the necklace?

Sorry, kid.
No reverse swapsies.

Pleasure doing
business with you.

Way to go, dillweed!
This is all your fault!

Now Dad's gonna see I'm
way more responsible than you.

None of that
matters now, Brad.

Mom's anniversary is ruined,
and Dad's never gonna
trust me again.

Hmm, remind me, dillweed.
Who's responsible
for the gift?

Hmm? Not me!
I "got fired,"
remember?

It's your problem now!

All right, Kick!
I need that necklace!

Your mother's
about to burst!

Um... Well, Dad,
about that present...


(IN DEMONIC VOICE)
Who said "present"?


My Burping Betsy doll!
Oh, it looks brand-new.

Harold! You had it restored!

Just go with it, Dad.

I'm so glad
you like it, Honey!

Like it? I love it!

It looks just like it did
when you won it for me
on our very first date.

Oh, this is the best
anniversary present ever!


And so much better than
some predictable jewelry.

Of course.

I wouldn't buy you
some dumb jewelry.
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

But, Dad! It was my idea
to trade the necklace
for the doll!

Can I have some
responsibility back now?

You some want some
responsibility,
do you, Bradley?

Oh, yes, Father!
Ever so much!

DAD: Oh, Bradley! Don't forget
to fix Brianna's dollhouse,
you responsible man, you.

Yeah, responsible Brad.

So, Kick, can I count
on you to hide Mom's
present next year, too?

Sure thing, Dad.

(BELL RINGS)

What are you
gonna get, Kick?

A slice of pepperoni pizza
topped with a slice of pizza.

They can do that now?

It's Pizza Friday, Gunther.
Think big.

I would like a single
slice topped with
a Cornish game hen.

BOTH: Tuna surprise?
On Pizza Friday?

What kind of weirdo would
serve tuna surprise
on Pizza Friday?

Surprise! Who's buzzed
for tSTUDENTS: Aw! Ee?

Hey! What happened
to Pizza Friday?

Tonight is the regional
spelling bee.

My champion Kendall needs
a lot of omega-3s for memory.

And what food is
rich in omega-3s?

Tuna! T-U-N-A, tuna.
From the Greek <i>thynos.</i>

Such a good
little speller!

I don't know what I would
do without my Kendall.

Celebrate?


Gunther? You okay?

It looks like
food poisoning.

It must be from
the tuna surprise!


Please, Kendall.
Snap out of it.


Do you think maybe
you could move
your lips a little?

I could talk off-stage,
you know, like I do with
Emo Kid on the debate team.

Let's try it! C-A-T...

This is hopeless.

What will I do without
my champion?

There's gotta be some student
left who can take her place.

(ALL GROANING)

Should have stuck
with Pizza Friday.

You! You've got
to take her place!
You're the only one left!

Me? Nah. Spelling's
not my thing.

Besides, what's
the big deal?

Forty years ago
we lost the spelling bee,
and it was my fault.

<i>The word is "principal."</i>

<i>Would you like to
hear it in a sentence?</i>

<i>That won't be necessary!</i>

<i>P-R-I-N-C-I-P-L-E.</i>

(IN SLOW MOTION) <i>Wrong!</i>



I should have asked
for it in a sentence!

That day I made a solemn vow
to train a champion and
win back the trophy.

Kendall was going
to be that champion.


But now that chance is ruined.

Brilliant summary
of your shameful past.

Too bad it's not
a summary bee.


It's pronounced "Rival."

And prepare to lose once
again, because my school
has a new student.

Javier!

It's Javier!
Jav-a-who-now?

He's undefeated
in six continents!


S-T-O-P!

Javier might be new
to the area.

But he is no stranger to
the language of language.

Tuna surprise?

No, thank you.
I see you are in trouble.

So many sick spellers.
(STUDENT RETCHING)

<i>Au contraire,</i> I have
my champion right here.

Really? You cannot
outspell me.

This is not your
baby stunting.

Spelling is a real
challenge for real men.

And your cheap, unfashionable
helmet will not protect you.

Tonight, defeat is spelled

M-E-L-L-O-W-B-R...

(TRILLING TONGUE)

We'll see who...

O-O-K.
And now Javier walks away.

Please say yes, Kick.

I'm in. But if I win,
I want Pizza Friday back.

Deal.

Forever.
Done.

And Tuesdays.

What am I,
made of Pizza Friday?

Let's do this thing.

Javier is going
down in defeat.
D-E-F-E-E-T.

We've got a lot
of work to do.

Time for my rigorous
spelling boot camp!


Well, none of that worked.

You're clearly a horrible
speller, and that was
a complete waste of time.


True. It is a complete
waste of time when you
are up against Javier.

How did you even get in here?
Show me your visitor's badge.

Visitor badges? We don't need
no stinking visitor badges.

I kid you.
They are right here.

See you boys later.

Yeah, bye.

It's hopeless!

There's no way Mellowbrook
is going to beat Javier.

Oh, this is more
humiliating than
my last doctor's visit.

Principal Henry,
I've got some bad news.

Your haircut is terrible.

Can I get
a second opinion?

No.

We will beat Javier.
But we've gotta try
something different.

I learn by doing.

What's the word?

"Adrenaline."

What am I supposed
to do with this again?

Throw it as hard as you can!


Remember that time
I painted your
office camouflage?

Oh, you demon!

Keep it up! Perfect!

A-D-R-E-N-A-L-I-N-E!

Adrenaline!

Great job! Perfect!

The word is "vault."

V-A-U-L-T!

Vault!

(CAR ALARMS BLARING)

The word is "balloon."

B-A-L-O... (GRUNTS)

Um, B-A-L-U? (GRUNTS)

B-A-L-L-O-O-N. Got it now.

We're almost out of time.

Okay! Well, I'll just
meet you at the bottom.


Thorny, T-H-O-R-N-Y!

Glue, G-L-U-E!

Grizzly, G-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y!

Incline, I-N-C-L-I-N-E!

Buckle, B-U-C-K-L-E!


For a while there,
I thought I was a goner.

If I said anything...

Don't worry about it.
Your secrets are safe with me.

Thank you, Kick.

Good evening, Kick.
I wish you the best of luck
in the competition.

Javier can spell for hours.


<i>Welcome to the Annual State
Regional Spelling Bee!</i>

<i>One speller from every
school will compete.</i>

<i>Misspell a single word</i>
<i>and you'll be</i>
<i>eternally frozen.</i>

<i>Oh, I mean disqualified.</i>

<i>The first speller may now
come to the microphone.</i>



<i>And we're
down to the last two.</i>

You're gonna do it, Kick!

Remember, ask for
the word in a sentence.

You're gonna spell lightning,
and you're gonna burp thunder!

<i>Ole!</i>

<i>The final word
is "principal."</i>

<i>Would you like to hear
it in a sentence?</i>

<i>That won't be necessary.</i>

<i>P-R-I-N-C-I</i>

<i>P-L-E.</i>

<i>That is incorrect.</i>

(ALL GASPING)

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

No!

<i>Mr. Buttowski?</i>

<i>I'd like to hear
the word in a sentence.</i>

<i>"Principal,"
as in, "Kick Buttowski,</i>

<i>"the principal would like
to see you in his office."</i>

Principal.
P-R-I-N-C-I-P-A-L!

<i>That is correct!
Mellowbrook wins!</i>

(ALL CHEERING)

Well done.

While you are
a horrible dresser,

you are
a worthy opponent.

I bow to you.

But you won't be
so lucky next year.

And besides,
there is always
<i>La</i> fair <i>de ciencia.</i>

(SIPPING JUICE BOX)

I couldn't have
done it without you.

A job well done,
Mr. Buttowski.

This calls for some
tuna surprise.

Mmm... (SCREAMS)

Kick, the district-wide
principals' square dance
competition is tonight.

I've never lost.

I'm on it.

(BANJO MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey, Kick.
How do you spell "relief"?

I don't know, Gunther.
How do you spell "relief"?


That's how.
