INVICTUS
timing & subtitle by pee-jay
[created using the movie script]

Let's go!

Come, boys. Tackle! Tackle!

All right.

Good work, boys. Keep it up.

"Mandela! Mandela! Mandela!"

Who is it, sir?

It's that terrorist, Mandela.
They let him out.

Remember this day, boys.

This is the day our country
went to the dogs.

Come. Let's go. Come.

<i>I'm now in a position to announce</i>

<i>that Mr. Nelson Mandela will be released</i>

<i>out of Victor Verster prison</i>

<i>on Sunday the 11.th February</i>

<i>at about 3:00 pm.</i>

<i>There's Mr. Nelson Mandela.</i>

<i>Mr. Mandela, a free man, taking his
first steps into a new South Africa.</i>

<i>This is the moment the world
has been waiting for.</i>

<i>...and the top news of the day
here in South Africa</i>

<i>and around the world.</i>

<i>The recent release of Nelson Mandela
from prison</i>

<i>has triggered a power struggle
between the ANC and their black rivals</i>

<i>There are reports that the
government has been</i>

<i>secretly providing Arms to these groups,</i>

<i>contributing to the violence that is
erupted through out the country.</i>

<i>South Africa appears to be
on the verge of the civil war.</i>

<i>Mr. Mandela has traveled to Durban
in an effort to persuade</i>

<i>a hundred thousand angry young
ANC supporters</i>

<i>on the front line to make peace.</i>

<i>Take your knives, and your guns,
and your pangas,</i>

<i>and throw them into the sea.</i>

<i>After four years of talks,</i>

<i>the day black South Africans
have been fighting for</i>

<i>has finally arrived.</i>

<i>For the first time they're free to
cast their vote along side whites.</i>

<i>And estimated twenty three million
people went to the polls today.</i>

<i>I, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela,</i>

<i>do hear-by swear to be faithful</i>

<i>to the Republic of South Africa.</i>

<i>Never, never and never again</i>

<i>shall it be that this beautiful land</i>

<i>will again experience the oppression</i>

<i>of one by another,</i>

<i>and suffer the indignity</i>

<i>of being the skunk of the world.</i>

Madiba!

Madiba!

Here he is. Like clockwork.

It makes him such an easy target.

Yes. Good morning.

"Mono Tata"
How are you?

We're sharp, Madiba.

Good.

Linga, how's your mother?
She's much better. Thanks.

Good. Very good.

Linga, watch your left.

Madiba. Madiba.

All right.

What does it say?

It says, “He can win an election,

but can he run a country?”

Not even one day on the job
and they're after you.

It's a legitimate question.

<i>Today marks the beginning of a new
era in South Africa</i>

<i>as President Mandela takes
office in Pretoria,</i>

<i>facing issues that range from
economic stagnation</i>

<i>and unemployment to rising crime.</i>

<i>While at the same time balancing
black aspirations with white fears.</i>

I never thought I'd see the day.

I feel sorry for you, son. You've
got your whole life ahead of you.

What's it going to be like now?
Don't be so gloomy.

Now I added vitamins.

There's a horrible flu bug going around.

You tell Nerine, when you get home.

Thanks, ma.

I'm telling you, Francois --

look at Angola, look at Mozambique.
Look at Zimbabwe.

We're next.

They're going to take our jobs
and drive us into the sea.

Just you wait.

Good morning.
Morn.

Good morning.
"Good morning"

Good morning.

Good morning, everyone.
Good morning.

Brenda, you've had your hair done.
I like it.

Thank you, Madiba. We need to talk about
your cabinet appointments and ministers.

Give me one moment, please.
Yes, Madiba.

After you, Comrade President.
Thank you, sir.

<i>Office of the President, good
morning.</i>

Brenda, please assemble all the
staff for me.

All those who haven't already left.

Right now? All of them?

Yes, please.

Yes. Madiba.

Ladies and gentlemen if you'd like
to follow me, please.

The president would like to speak
with you.

Here he comes.
Yeah.

He wants the satisfaction
of firing us himself.

I'd like you to stay out here.

But, Madiba... - I cannot talk to
them hiding behind men with guns.

Gooie more almal.

Good morning.
How are you this morning?

Fine.
It's good to see you.

Thank you for coming on such short
notice.

Some of you may know who I am.

I couldn't help noticing the empty
offices

as I came to work this morning.

And all of the packing boxes.

Now, of course, if you want to leave,
that is your right.

And if you feel in your heart

that you cannot work with
your new government,

then it is better that you do leave,

right away.

But if you are packing up because
you fear that your language,

or the color of your skin,
or who you worked for before,

disqualifies you from working here,

I am here to tell you,

have no such fear.

What is verby is verby.

The past is the past.

We look to the future, now.

We need your help.

We want your help.

If you'd like to stay,

you'd be doing your country
a great service.

All I ask is that you do your work

to the best of your abilities,
and with good hearts.

I promise to do the same.

If we can manage that,

our country will be a shining light
in the world.

Thank you.

Molo, sis.

It's still morning?

Yeah. So, now, when you get a chance,
can we get the schedule for the month?

Yeah.
We need to plan security.

Office of the President, good morning.

Yes sir.

We will do have that ready for you.

We need more men.

Did you talk to Brenda about it?

Yes. Yesterday.

That must be Jessie, with the schedule.

Come in, beautiful.

What is this?

Mr. Jason Tshabalala?

That's me. Am I under arrest?

Captain Van Eck and team
reporting for duty, sir.

What duty?

With the Presidential bodyguard.
We've been assigned to this office.

Here are our orders.

You're Special Branch, right?

You'll see that they've been signed.

I don't care if they're signed---

Just wait here.

Sorry to disturb you, sir.

You look agitated, Jason.

That's because there are four Special
Branch cops in my office.

What did you do?
Nothing.

They say they're the Presidential
bodyguards.

And they have orders signed by you.

Oh yes. Oh yes.

These men have special training by
SAS.

They've a lots of experience.
They protected De Klerk.

Yes, sir. But it doesn't mean that they
have to come---

You asked for more men, didn't you?

Yes, sir. I asked---

When people see me in public,
they see my bodyguards.

You represent me, directly.

The rainbow nation starts here.

Reconciliation starts here.

Reconciliation, sir?
Yes. Reconciliation, Jason.

Comrade President...

Not long ago these guys tried to kill us.

Maybe even these four guys in my office
tried and, often, succeeded!

Yes, I know.

Forgiveness starts here, too.

Forgiveness liberates the soul.

It removes fear.

That is why it is such a powerful weapon.

Please, Jason,

try it.

Sorry to disturb you, sir.

Just a minute.

Two copies of the schedule.

Thank you, Jessie.

Jason, can we get rid
of these guys, now?

Here's the schedule for the month.

Let's look them over for assignments.

Right.
What?

Hey, Jason. Can I talk to you?

How can we trust them?

We can't.
That's what Madiba wants, okay.

Let's go.

Are there any special orders or
conditions?

No. Oh, yes.

Madiba doesn't like it if you don't
smile when you push people away.

Seriously?

Yes, seriously.

It's the new South Africa.

Madiba?

That's the President's clan name.

That's what we call him.

We'll call him Mr. President.

Can we go through the schedule now?

Can you gentlemen come closer?

How's he going to do all this, huh?

When does he take a break?

He says he rested enough in prison.

Here's a headache.
What?

The rugby match.

England against Springboks
at Loftus Stadium.

Well. That's gonna be a headache for
England, that's for sure.

We're going to donder them.

I don't care about the game.

All I care about is that
the President'll be exposed.

Yeah. To thousand drunken...
Sports fans?

Yes.

Sports fans.

Who didn't vote for him.

Who probably hate him.

Who came out of the womb
with guns in their hands.

What?

<i>Let's welcome captain, Francois
Pineaar!</i>

<i>and his squad of team Springboks
here in Loftus.</i>

<i>Today's game RAF is from New Zealand.</i>

Hey, Guys.

I want your eyes on the crowd
at all times.

He's taking the middle of the field.

He's going to walk in, shake hands,
and walk back. And that's it.

You got it?
Yeah.

Okay. Let's go.

<i>Ladies and gentleman,</i>

<i>it is our pleasure xxx today</i>

<i>at Loftus Versfeld</i>

<i>our newly elected President,</i>

<i>Mr. Nelson Mandela.</i>

Good luck, captain.

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.

Good luck, son.
Thank you very much.

Good luck.
Thank you, sir.

Good luck, Chester.
Yes sir.

Good luck.
Thank you.

Sir.

Stop him.
No. Stay with him.

Thank you for honoring our new flag!

It's a pleasure, sir.

Thank you.

How are you. How are you.

Good to see you.
Thank you. Thank you.

Good to see you.

Madiba. Madiba. Madiba!

You're delaying the rugby, sir.

Oh, yes, of course.

Why didn't you stop him?
Well. You try next time.

Does he do that sort of thing
all the time?

Ask my ulcer.

Good thing it was just a cup.
And good thing he never saw it.

Oh, he saw it. He sees everything.

I hate rugby.

Yay!
"That's right"

With you. With you. Keep on running.
Outside . Outside. Come on.

Come on.

<i>...Team England scored...</i>

<i>England, 11</i>

<i>South Africa, 0</i>

These English mean business.
We need to focus!

Come on. We need to focus. Focus!

Come on.

Why don't we do a little work
while we watch.

We have a lot of promises to keep.

Yes, we do.

It's not too late,

if the boys can just pick up their game.

If they don't, heads will roll.

C'mon you bloody bastards!

Where do you want go first,
for foreign investment?

Where the money is.

America, England, Saudi Arabia.

How long before the World Cup?

About a year.

Now, it's time enough for
improvement.

Mr. President...

...I wouldn't get my hopes up.

We're a damn disgrace.

Do you see all those old
apartheid flags?

It's a disgrace.

It's also a constitutional right.

Along with the apartheid anthem. I know.

But it's time people moved on.

Look at this.

All of the whites are cheering
for the Springboks.

All of the blacks are cheering
for England.

I used to do that on the island.

We would cheer for anyone
but the 'boks.

It made warders very angry.

Of course it did.

Sorry I'm late, how's it going?

Very badly.

Maybe it's just as well.

Why?

I've just been at a meeting of
the National Sports executive.

There's strong support to drop
the Springbok emblem

and colors altogether

If they're playing badly.

Maybe it's a good time to make a change.

This could be the last time we have
to look at the green and gold.

Shit.

<i>Francois Pienaar's team came
to Loftus Versfeld stadium</i>

<i>this afternoon,</i>

<i>unprepared and arrogant.</i>

They left 80 minutes later with
their tails between their legs,

like whipped mongrels.

And I, for one, am glad.

Not because they lost, but because
there's now no way to ignore the fact

that we are completely
and utterly unprepared

<i>to reenter the world of top-notch
international rugby.</i>

<i>The Rugby World Cup is now
less than a year away,</i>

<i>and I, for one, am relieved
that we are the host nation,</i>

<i>and therefore qualified automatically
for the tournament.</i>

Somebody gets the axe.

<i>Because I'm not sure that we would
get in on merit alone.</i>

Who's it gonna be?

<i>Pienaar's team played without discipline,</i>

<i>without strategy and without courage.</i>

<i>And therefore...</i>

He's trying to get them to drop me.

He's just bitter because the Springboks
were boycotted when he played.

Maybe, but people listen to
what he says.

<i>they brought shame upon our nation,</i>

<i>and I, for one, can say without fear
of contradiction,</i>

<i>that today, these fifteen so-called men</i>

<i>did not deserve to wear
the hallowed green and gold.</i>

Here's your muti, Madiba.

I warmed the milk tonight.

You're too good to me, Mary.

Your daughter called, to cancel
her visit this weekend.

All right. Did she say why?

No, she didn't.

She said to tell you she was sorry.

I see.

Do you need anything else tonight?

No, Mary. Thank you. I'll go to bed.

Good evening, Tata.

Good evening, Mary.

Hello. There you go.

Oh, yes.

Some nice pants for you.
God bless you.

There you go.

There you go.

God bless you.

You're a very lucky boy.

It's a real Springbok practise jersey!

I mean, I know It's a bit big, but
it's warm and it'll last for ever!

C'mon.

C'mon. Take it. It's yours!

Why won't he take it?

If he wears it, the others will beat
him up.

Because the Springboks
are playing so badly?

No. Because, for them, the Springboks
still represent apartheid.

...and now, for the next item
on our agenda.

The NSC executive proposes a vote
on the following motion

that as a prominent symbol
of the apartheid era,

the colors, emblem and the name
of the Springboks

be eliminated immediately

and that all sports teams
representing South Africa

shall be known forthwith as
the Proteas.

Now, Comrades, we will submit
this motion to a hand vote.

In the event of a close count,

we will go to a written ballot.

All those in favor of eliminating
the Springboks,

raise your hands.

Viva! Viva!

Viva Proteas! Viva!

"Viva!"
Viva Proteas! Viva!

"Viva!"
Viva Proteas! Viva!

"Viva!"
Avanza!

"Ole"

Both units to their cars. Right now.

What do I tell the Japanese
trade delegation?

I delegate that decision to you.

Do you want me to inform the VP?

No.

We should at least include
the Minister of Sport.

No.

I strongly advise against doing this.
Especially on your own.

It gives the impression of autocratic
leadership.

You risk alienating your cabinet
and your party.

Your advice is duly noted.

Madiba, the people want this.

They hate the Springboks. They don't
want to be represented by a team

they cheered against all their lives.

Yes, I know. But in this instance
the people are wrong.

And as their elected leader,
it is my job to show them that.

You're risking your political capital.

You're risking your future as our leader.

The day I am afraid to do that is
the day I am no longer fit to lead.

At least risk it for something
more important than rugby.

Tell the boys that I want to go to
Eersterust, very fast.

We in the executive'd like to applaud you

for your diligence and your courage.

Please, join us in our anthem.

¶ Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika ¶

¶ Maluphakanyisw' uphondo lwayo ¶

¶ Yizwa imithandazo yethu ¶

¶ Nkosi sikelela... ¶

Comrades, comrades, members
of the choir---

we would only interrupt such beautiful
music for something truly important.

Please, welcome, President Mandela!

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Why thank you. Please.

Smile.

Brothers, sisters, Comrades,

I am here because I believe
you have made a decision

with insufficient information and
foresight.

I am aware of your earlier vote.

I am aware that it was unanimous.

Nonetheless, I believe we should
restore the Springboks.

Restore their name, their emblem
and their colors, immediately.

Let me tell you why.

On Robben Island, in Pollsmoor Prison,

all of my jailers were Afrikaners.

For twenty seven years,

I studied them.

I learned their language,

I read their books,

their poetry.

I had to know my enemy,

before I could prevail against him.

And we did prevail, did we not?

All of us here we prevailed.

Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner.

They are our fellow South Africans,

our partners in democracy.

And they treasure Springbok rugby.

If we take that away, we lose them.

We prove that we are what they feared
we would be.

We have to be better than that.

We have to surprise them

with a compassion,

with restraint,

and generosity.

I know.

All of the things they denied us.

But this is no time to celebrate
a petty revenge.

This is the time to build our nation

using every single brick available to
us---

even if that brick comes wrapped in
green and gold.

You elected me your leader.

Let me lead you now.

Who is with me on this?

Who is with me?

Twelve votes.

Twelve!

A luxury.

We only needed one more yes than no.

What if you hadn't got it?

Well, as you know,
that is the parties decision.

I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got
problems everywhere we look.

Housing, food, jobs,
crime, our currency.

You can't keep interrupting affairs
of state to placate a minority.

But, I must.

That minority still controls the police,
the army, and the economy.

If we lose them we cannot address
the other issues.

So, this rugby,

it's just a political calculation?

It is a human calculation.

If we take away, what they cherish---

the Springboks, their national anthem --

we just reinforce the cycle of fear
between us.

I'll do what I must to break that
cycle.

Or it will destroy us.

This beer tastes like shit, man.

It's not the beer.

Take another.

Everybody take one.

Boys,  I'd like to propose a toast...

To the taste of defeat.

Drink it.

Remember this.

And promise yourself, never to taste
it again.

You're right. It tastes like shit.

Here's the schedule for the
overseas trip.

Let me see.

$ Speaking Afrikaans $

What did he just say?

He asked when we were supposed to sleep.

As well as other basic human functions.

Hey.

If Madiba can do it, we can do it.

In a common struggle

that has brought about our emancipation

and pushed back the frontiers of racism.

The millions of our people

say thank you, and thank you again.

I come here with a message.

<i>People of the Unites States of America:</i>

<i>Open your markets to us.</i>

<i>And come invest in our country.</i>

<i>...and in Japan, President Mandela
met with Japanese officials.</i>

<i>As he concluded a gruelling trip
to the Far East...</i>

And in related news, it was
announced that President Mandela

will visit South Africa this week.

Stop it, old man.

Hey. It's cold, man.

Morning, Madiba.
How are you?

Fine. Thanks.
Morning, sir.

How is your family, Hendrick?

Top shape, sir. How about yours?

I have a large family.

42 million.

I don't think I'll walk today.

We never, never ask him
about his family.

But he asks about ours all the time.

Think about it, man. He's separated
from his wife, his children...

How often do you see them here, huh?

He's not a saint, okay. He's a man,
with a man's problems

he doesn't need us reminding him
about them.

Good morning, Madiba.
Good morning.

Thank you very much.
Enjoy it.

Oh, yes.

Very good.

Very good.

Brenda, good morning.
Good morning, Madiba.

I like that dress.

Thank you.

This is for you.

What is it?

Your pay checks. You haven't been
collecting them.

What's wrong?

This is terrible.

It's what De Klerk got.
Plus an increase for inflation.

<i>Today, President Mandela announced that,
in his opinion---</i>

Thanks.

<i>---his salary is too high.</i>

Dead right. They're all overpaid.

<i>He has therefore decided to donate
a third of his monthly income to charity.</i>

Give me the houses and cars they give him
and I'll donate a third of my salary too.

You would not. Not in a million years.
Pienaar, Hallo.

Hang on a moment, please.

<i>President Mandela said that
he wished to set an example</i>

to other leaders and Cabinet Ministers.
Yes. Of course.

Why thank you. Thank you
Fat chance.

They're lining their pockets as fast as
they can.

Must be his girlfriend, Nerine...

He knows I'd bloody kill him.

What?

Who was that?

Well. I told you. It was
his girlfriend. - Shush.

I've been invited to tea.

With who?

The President.

The President of SA Rugby?

Count your fingers after he shakes
your hand, boy.

The President.

He wants me over for tea,
week after next.

Mr. Francois---

you must tell Madiba that
the bus service is very bad,

and too expensive.

He must do something about it.

Good night everybody.
Good night, Eunice.

Thank you.

What the hell does he want with you?

I don't know.

<i>What?</i>

Francois, relax. You've met him before.

I shook his hand on the rugby field.

And you didn't even vote.

Come on, Nerine.
He's still the President.

I play rugby. What am I going to say
to the guy?

Say to him, thank you for inviting
me.

What if I pull something stupid in
front of him?

You won't, okay? I'll pick you up
right here.

Bye.
Mr. Francois...

Francois, a picture please!

Yeah. Okay. Over here. Okay?

Mr. Pienaar... Mr. Pienaar...

Come on, guys.

See who's coming for tea?

My nephew wants me to get his
autograph.

Who?

Francois Pienaar.

Who wants to escort him in?

Hey. No autographs, okay?
I know how to do my job, okay?

Who's this Francois Pienaar?

You can't be serious? He's the captain
of the Springboks.

I like soccer, myself.

Well, you know what they say about
soccer---

It's gentleman's game played by
hooligans.

One the other hand, rugby's a hooligan's
game played by gentlemen.

Ja, ja, I've heard that one before.

It wasn't funny the first time.

Can I ask you a question, Lieutenant?

Yeah, of course.

What's he like?

When I worked for the previous President,
it was my job to be invisible.

This President--- when he found out
I like English toffee

he brought me some back from his
visit in England.

To him, no one's invisible.

That's where you wait. One of his
assistants will come for you.

And the bathroom's over there,
if you need it.

Okay. Thanks.

What are our chances in the World Cup?

I mean, for real.

We'll do our best.
That, I can guarantee.

<i>Office of the President.</i>

So, what is he like?

Well, he's not as big as he looks on TV.

And we don't stand a bloody chance in
the World Cup.

Mr. Pienaar?

Right this way please.

Go in.

Francois,

what an honor.

I'm so excited.

Thank you for coming all this way to
see me.

Yes, sir. Thank you for inviting me,
Mr. President.

So, tell me Francois, how's your
ankle?

My ankle?

I was told it was hurt.

Has it healed?

The truth is, sir, you never really play
at a hundred percent, no matter what.

Ah. Yes.

In sports, as in life, yes?

Yes sir.

Ah. Please, sit.

Take this one.

Looking into the light hurts my
eyes.

Mrs. Brits,

you are a shining light in my day.

Yes sir.

Mrs. Brits, this is Francois Pienaar,
captain of the Springboks.

Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits.
Aangename kennis.

Shall I pour, sir?

No. No. I'd prefer to do it myself.

Thank you very much, Mrs. Brits.

How do you like your tea, Francois?

Just milk, please.

The English have given us many things,
including rugby,

but afternoon tea, that is the greatest.

"Alien."

Thank you, sir.

You have a very difficult job.

I do?

I have a trading business.

Captain of the Springboks.

A very difficult job.

Not compared to yours, Mr. President.

Well, no one's trying to tear my
head off while I'm doing mine.

Yes, sir.

Tell me Francois,

what is your philosophy on leadership.

How do you inspire your team to do
their best?

By example. I've always taught to
lead by example, sir.

Well. That is right.

That is exactly right.

But how to get them to be better than
they think they can be?

That is very difficult, I find.

Inspiration, perhaps.

How do we inspire ourselves to
greatness,

when nothing less will do?

How do we inspire everyone around us?

I sometimes think, it's just by using
the work of others.

On Robben Island,

when things got very bad,

I found inspiration in a poem.

A poem?

A Victorian poem.

Just words.

But they helped me to stand, when
all I wanted to do was to lie down.

But you didn't come all this way
to hear an old man

talk about things that make no sense.

No, no, please, Mr. President.

It makes complete sense to me.

On the day of a big match,
say a test,

in the bus on the way to the stadium,
nobody talks.

Ah. Yes.

They're all preparing.

Right.

But when I think we're ready,
I have the bus driver put on a song

something I've chosen, one we all
know.

And we listen to the words together

and it helps.

I remember when I was invited to the
1992 Olympics in Barcelona.

Everybody in the stadium greeted me
with a song.

At the time the future--- our future---
seemed very bleak.

But to hear that song, and the voices
of people from all over our planet

made me proud to be South African.

It inspired me to come home and do
better.

It allowed me to expect more of myself.

May I ask, what was the song, sir?

Well,

it was Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika.

A very inspiring song.

We need inspiration, Francois.

Because, in order to build our nation,

we must all exceed our own expectations.

So? What's he like?

He's not like anyone I've ever met
before.

Well? What did he want?

What did you talk about?
You talk about rugby?

What did you talk about?

Francois, it's like talking to a
brick wall. What did he say?

I think he wants us to win the World Cup.

Excuse me.

What do you think?

It doesn't matter what I think.

Yes, it does.

Okay.

I think he looks like one of the
policemen

who forced us out of our house
when you were in jail.

I don't like seeing you shake his hand.

And I'm not the only one.

You criticize without understanding.

You seek only to address your own
personal feelings.

That is selfish thinking, Zindzi.

It does not serve the nation.

Zindzi, wait, please.

Zindzi, I...

Here.

Give this to your mother for me, please.

What is it?

It's a bracelet I found unpacking.

Why don't you just throw it away?

I don't have the right, doesn't
belong to me

If she left it, she meant to throw it
away.

Mrs. Pienaar said you were finished with
the paper.

Ja. Of course.

Let's go.
Go. Go.

Hey!

Here we go.

Hit! Yes.

The World Cup is played every four
years.

Sixteen teams qualify from around the
world.

Four pools of four teams,

each playing in nine different
venues around the country.

Two teams will advance from each
pool to the quarter finals.

The Ivory Coast qualifies.

That's wonderful.

According to the experts, we'll reach
the quarter finals, and no further.

According to the experts, you and I
should still be in jail.

<i>You make a personal appearance in
the finals,</i>

<i>and at the opening match between
the Australia and the Springboks.</i>

The finals will be broadcast to over a
billion people around the world, live.

A billion people watching us!

This is a great opportunity.

I reckon you've knocked the stuffing
out of them today.

<i>And now! Come on, boys.</i>

I haven't even begun.

<i>All right. And now...</i>

We may not be the most talented team
in the world...

but sure is we're going to be the
fittest.

Let's go again, guys.
Come on, boys.

Brenda.
Yes, sir.

Please get the head of South African
rugby for me.

Right away.
Thank you.

Yes. Come on.

Guys, listen up! Dr. Ledges wants
a few  words, please.

Afternoon men.

Good to see you all working so hard.

I have a short announcement.

As part of the PR buildup to the
World Cup,

you will be conducting coaching clinics
in townships all over the country.

I know, I know, you have plenty on
your plates already---

but this is a request from the top.

The very top.

Thank you.

This is complete crap, man.

What is this, huh? Are we some sort
of circus act now?

We didn't talk about shit like this.

They expect us to play our best,
to give our bloody all,

then they add to our bloody
workload...

He's right.

What do you think about this, Chester?

I try not to think. 'Cause it interferes
with my rugby.

See! Now there's a rugby player.

Talk to them, cappie.

You gotta make them understand
we just don't have the time for this.

Ja.

I'm not going to talk to them.

Why not?

We've become more then just a rugby
team.

And we might as well get used to it.

Is this you speaking, or Mandela?

<i>Yeah, exactly, huh?</i>

You know me better than that.

You know, times change.

And we need to change as well.

<i>Oh, that's great.</i>

Shit.

Ja.

I'm glad I don't live here.

Don't forget, we've got cameras on
us at all times.

What a bloody joke.

"CHESTER CHESTER CHESTER"

Chester--- I reckon you're up.

What am I supposed to do?
What you do best.

Let rip.

Who wants to play rugby?

Who here knows the first rule of
rugby?

Me.

What is it? - You hit another
players when the Raf isn't looking!

No, no, no. The first rule of rugby

is you can only pass the ball
backwards or sideways.

All right? Do we practise that?

"Ja"
All right. Form a line.

Let's go, boys. Here we go.

Get ready.

Keep your hands up.

Okay.

Like this, like this.

I'm here so I make it like this.

Now, you run.

There you go.

...and then catch it. Right.

So, I want you in groups of three,
okay?

All right. One, two, three!

...and in addition to the nationwide
PR campaign,

we propose that all retail outlets
charge

a nominal fee for plastic bags.

We believe that this will generate---
Ah. Excuse me.

Mr. Minister, if you'll forgive me.
This all sound excellent,

and we will return to it, but...

if you'll indulge me for just one
more minute---

<i>Well. Soccer is usually their favorite
sport here. But things changed today.</i>

<i>When a group of local kids really took to
the Springboks in a surprise visit...</i>

<i>...Francois Pienaar...</i>

You see that,

that picture is worth any number of
speeches.

This is Johan De Villiers reporting Live
from Cape Town airport

where the Springboks' flight has
just landed. - Okay. - Thank you.

<i>The green and gold have just one week to
put the finishing touches</i>

<i>to their gruelling training program</i>

and I, for one, must admit to being

cautiously optimistic.

I say cautiously, because in my
humble opinion

this Springbok team has been
over-practised on the field,

and over-committed off it.

<i>Which makes beating a powerhouse
Australian side</i>

<i>in next week's Cup opener a tall
order,</i>

<i>especially as this is
an inexperienced team</i>

<i>with a history of coming up short in
big matches.</i>

<i>This is Johan de Villiers, Live in
Cape Town,</i>

<i>returning you to the studio in
Johannesburg.</i>

<i>Thanks Johan. The update---</i>

Around the world--- objectively---

what are they saying about our
chances to beat Australia?

Everyone thinks they'll beat us.

And if they do, we'll have to go
through England and the All Blacks

just to get to the Final.

So it is very important that we beat
Australia.

Thank you.

Madiba, the Cabinet Ministers are here
to brief you on the trip to Taiwan.

Oh, yes.

I'll be right out.
Thank you, sir.

¶ Matters not the circumstance ¶

¶ We rise above, take a chance ¶

¶ I thank whatever ¶

¶ Whatever gods may be ¶

¶ 9,000 days were set aside¶

¶ 9,000 days of destiny ¶

¶ 9,000 days to thank gods ¶

¶ Wherever they may be ¶

One week, boys.

We want snipers on top of the stadium
and the surrounding buildings here.

No problem.

We want those two approaches
completely sanitized.

Two approaches?

We're not going to decide which way
he comes in until the very last moment.

We want uniforms, plain clothes,
sharp-shooters...

And sniffer dogs.

And if you need more men,
we have an army unit for you

on standby at Silvermine.

We're not going to take chances,
gentlemen.

The President's going to be exposed.

Much too exposed.

Brenda...

...I have been studying.

For the summit in Taiwan? Good.

No. Not exactly.

Test me.

They look like thugs.

Block out their names.

See if I can recognize them.

Andre Joubert.

Gavin Johnson.

Did I get them right?

Yes, Madiba.

That's the way I used to study in
law school.

Unfortunately,

Chester is far too easy to identify.

But that will change.

It must.

Go.
Go. Go. Go.

Team meeting. After dinner.

C'mon, Springboks!

Round. Gather round.

Pass it away.
What's this Francois? Homework?

Ja, ja.

Make sure everyone has got one.

What is this?

We need to learn this song.

We can't just mouth the words
anymore.

Nobody cares, as long as we're
winning the matches.

You're wrong. They do care.

It's their bloody song, not ours.

Flippin' terrorist song, man.

Yeah, they used to arrest you for
singing it.

Right, and now it's one of our
anthems.

I can't even read it or pronounce
the words.

All right, guys. It's optional.

Take it if you want to.

It means "God Bless Africa".

Which you have to admit, we could
use.

Tell us, Mr. President, have you
always been a rugby fan?

People do not realize that I played
rugby myself,

when I was a student at Fort Hare.

It is a very rough game.

Almost as rough as politics.

How do you think the Springboks
will do?

I think they will do very well.

Their level of commitment is tremendous.

Now, it's been said that you used to
support any team

that played against the Springboks.

Yes, well, obviously, that is no
longer true.

I am one hundred percent behind our
boys.

After all, if I cannot change
when circumstances demand it,

how can I expect others to?

¶ And it's not just a game ¶

¶ You can't throw me away ¶

¶ I put all I had on the line ¶

¶ And I give and you take ¶

¶ And I played the high stakes ¶

¶ I've won and I've lost ¶

¶ But, I'm fine ¶

¶ Hear me say I'll wise up 'til the end ¶

¶ Hear me say I'll stand up for my
friends ¶

¶ And I crash to the ground ¶

¶ And it's just my own sound ¶

¶ I drop in the blink of an eye ¶

¶ I'm colorblind ¶

Francois.
Welcome Mr. President.

Gentlemen...

forgive me for interrupting your
work

the day before such an important
match,

but I just wanted to come and wish
you good luck, in person.

Sometimes, very seldom, as President,

I am allowed to do what I want.

Mr. President, this is---

Oh, I know, who this is.

Andre, good luck.
Pleased to meet you. Thank you, sir.

Brendan, good luck to you.

Kevin, good luck.
Thank you.

James.
Mr. President.

Good luck.
Thank you.

Japie
Thank you, sir.

Good luck.

Did you ever imagine this?

Good luck.

How could I?

Thank you. Good luck.
Mr. President.

Good luck.
Thank you.

Good luck to you.

Good luck.

Good luck, son.

Good luck. Hennie...

...Good luck.
Thank you.

But where is Chester?

He's injured, sir. His hamstring.
We're trying to keep it quiet.

Well, will he be out for the entire
tournament?

With hamstrings, who knows?

We'll miss him.

The whole country will miss him.

Well, gentlemen...
Mr. President, sir---

Yes, Hennie.
This is for you. From us.

I'm honored, gentlemen. Truly
honored.

And you must know that your country
supports you, completely.

Good luck to you all.
"Thank you, sir"

Francois, walk with me.

I have something for you.

It has helped me through the years.

I hope, it helps you.

Thank you, Mr. President.

Thank you.

It's time for bed, Tata.

I'm going to stay up awhile.

The country is excited tonight.

You need to sleep. The doctor said.

The doctor has no sense of occasion.

<i>...and the good result here today...</i>

<i>...black and gold...</i>

<i>It's over!</i>

Thank you.
Hey.

You know what's the best thing about
you being the captain?

The honor?
No.

You don't have to share a room.

Nerine... No, I can't... I can't...

Come on, Francois. It's been weeks.
 I can't. I need to be really angry.

I know, it's working. I need to be
angry tomorrow.

What is this?
A poem.

From President. - How does a poem
help you play rugby?

The same way your visit does.
Inspiration.

All right. Come on. With you.

What happened?
We scored.

Come on.

Go!

We won.

We did?

Very good.
That was beautiful, Tata.

What do you say to this?
Well. That was fantastic!

You must be very happy!

Any man would be happy to be dancing
with a beautiful lady like you.

Mr. President, you're exaggerating.

Not at all.

My father was a Xhosa,
so he was a polygamist.

As you know, I am not.

But when I look at you...
I envy my father.

"Say, one, two, three, four! Hey!"

Coach's run, six a.m.

What?
Pass it on.

Coach's run, six a.m.

Six.

Drink up.

Joe. Coach's run, six, six a.m.

Hey, guys. I hope you're not going
to be this slow next week.

Hi. - I like to see you.
Cappie? What's going on?

A change of pace. Come.

Bloody boy!
There you go. Good.

Come.

<i>Bye-bye.</i>

That's what they used to do, smuggle
gravel in from the yard

throw it across the floor so they
could hear the wardens come in

Oh, wow.

Can we see the President's cell?
Yes, of course.

Wow. Can you believe this?

Now, the number on the door...

46664 means, he was the 466th prisoner
to be intend here in 1964.

We've done it up just the way it was.

Come with me.

"Out of the night that covers me,"

"Black as the pit from pole to pole,"

"I thank whatever gods may be"

" For my unconquerable soul."

"In the fell clutch of circumstance"

"I have not winced nor cried aloud."

"Under the bludgeonings of chance"

"My head is bloody, but unbow'd."

"Beyond this place of wrath and tears"

"Looms but the Horror of the shade,"

"And yet the menace of the years"

"Finds and shall find me unafraid."

"It matters not how strait the gate,"

"How charged with punishment the scroll,"

"I am the master of my fate:"

"I am the captain of my soul."

Look at that.

Tata? Madiba?

Sir?

What happened?

It's simple exhaustion, but it'll lead
to worse if it's not treated.

He needs a complete rest.

And I don't mean just simply shifting
the affairs of state to his bedroom.

No phone calls, no visitors,
no meetings. No politics.

You know him. He won't do that.

Then I'm going to put him into
hospital. In isolation.

No. Not yet. I'll threaten him with
hospital if he doesn't behave.

I'll cancel everything.

And I'll come back tonight to make
sure he's not waking.

Don't cancel the trip to Taiwan.
Not yet.

What was that mean?

Chester's back.

<i>All right. All right. That's enough.
All right.</i>

Madiba, this is the delegation---

I know who this is.

Welcome.

Thank you for coming so far to see me.
Thank you. How do you do?

I'm fine. Welcome.
Thank you very much.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen please
apologize. The game is delayed.</i>

<i>...in the semifinals, South Africa
against France...</i>

This is it. Let's go.
All right. Go.

<i>...International business alliances.</i>

<i>Strong industries have developed in
shipping and computers</i>

<i>Our information...</i>

Please, excuse me.

<i>Yes, Mr. President, of course.</i>

<i>Gentlemen, let us continue  in ten
minutes...</i>

This is good. Very good!

So, who is our next opponent?

The All Blacks play England tomorrow.
Then, we'll know.

I see.

You will make sure that my schedule
is free for the entire match.

Oh, yes, Tata.

This is good. This is very good.

<i>...black team mates come to
congratulate big fella yet again.</i>

<i>Lomu is becoming one of the most
intimidating...</i>

Why don't we do a little work while
we're here.

Just enjoy the rugby.

<i>...World Cup semifinal against
England.</i>

So, let me understand this.

The All Blacks are killing a team
that thrashed us last year?

Thanks for reminding me.

Yet again.

We're gonna really have to tackle
a lot better than the English are.

Yeah. That's sure.
That's sure.

We do.
Ja.

<i>That is Lomu's second try this
afternoon.</i>

<i>This guy really likes scoring tries
against the English...</i>

Are those the judicial appointments
for the Free State?

They'll keep until after the match.

<i>Here's the kick.</i>

I'm the President, you know.

<i>And the conversion is good!</i>

Are you watching this guy?
He's about your size, but...

How much does this Lomu weigh?

120 kilos.
Shit.

Same as me.
Yeah., but you're slow.

Lomu looks for contact every time
he gets the ball.

Ja.

It's good for us.

Ja.

I will break my arm,
my leg, my neck,

but I will not let that frickin' guy
go.

With you, cappie.

With you, captain.
With you, cappie. With you.

...when you pass it, yeah? Grab this.

Run!

Yes.

Still think I'm wasting my time with
the rugby?

<i>...he's in the clear and he will...</i>

Brenda, please tell the Minister
of Sport

I'd like the full report on
the All Blacks.

This rugby, it's still strictly
political?

Oh yes. Oh yes. Of course.

Hello, Francois.

Don't lose them. I won't be able
to get more.

Thanks, Francois.

Me, mom, Nerine--- wait,

and the fourth?

Who's it for?

The All Blacks beat Ireland 43 to 19.

I see.

They beat Wales 34 to 9.

I see.

They beat Japan 145 to 17.

145 points, in one match?

It's a new international record.

They beat Scotland 48 to 30 in the
quarter finals.

You saw the match with England.

Yes.

45 to 29. And it was not that close.

They seem unstoppable.

If the opposing teams play them
straight up, Jonah Lomu runs wild.

If they focus on Lomu, that leaves
others free.

And, also, there's the business of
the haka.

A Maori war dance. Yes.

It's very powerful.

My sources tell me that half of the
All Black matches

are won before the first whistle,
because of it.

How can we beat them?

I have the coach's number.
Maybe, you could call him and ask.

No. no. I don't want to distract
their focus, even for one minute.

But, how can we win?

Maybe we won't. They're favored
two-to-one.

Madiba, we've already exceeded all
expectations. On and off the field.

It's not enough. Not now.
Not so close.

This country is hungry for greatness.

I brought one of your mom's protein
shakes.

Thinking about tomorrow?

No,

tomorrow's taken care of,

one way or another.

I'm was thinking about how you
spend 30 years in a tiny cell,

and come out ready to forgive
the people who put you there.

Go home, man. There's nothing more
you can do today.

Have I ever mentioned to you that
I hate rugby?

Once or twice, yes.

I just want to get him through
tomorrow, safely.

That's all.

We all do.

The tickets sold out long before
the team became popular.

it's not exactly going to be the
rainbow nation out there.

And that's the reality.

Now, all it takes is one idiot
trying to make a statement,

or one fool who thinks that he hears
god speaking to him through the radio.

It's happened before!

But not today.

Not on our watch.

And not today.

Hey. Flag face. Flag face.

Flag face?
Bugger off!

We're at Ellis Park on this historic
day,

where, even this early, crowd
expectation is at fever pitch...

<i>because their beloved green and gold</i>

<i>have somehow managed to defy all
expectations.</i>

<i>But now they come up against a team
unlike any they have played before.</i>

<i>These All Blacks are possibly one of
the greatest international sides ever,</i>

<i>with a player in Jonah Lomu
who is as dominant as any</i>

<i>this correspondent has ever seen.</i>

Madiba!

Final approach, Captain.

Let it be noted that I'm taking
control of the aircraft.

Duly noted.

I take full responsibility for what
happens from now on.

Do you see that jet, to the east?

<i>Did they get clearance for this?</i>

Not from us.

Where is he?

<i>VIP box.</i>

Get him out of there. Now.

No time.

What the hell was that?

Boka!
Yeah.

Come on!

<i>...World Cup Finals.</i>

<i>Please welcome the South African
Springboks!</i>

<i>And New Zealand; All blacks.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome</i>

<i>The President of the Republic of
South Africa</i>

<i>Mr. Nelson Mandela.</i>

<i>Dr. Nelson Mandela, the President of
South Africa</i>

<i>in the rugby jersey with the number
six on its back...</i>

The All Black's won't like it.

Francois, your country is very
proud of you.

Thank you, sir.

Good luck.
Thank you.

...Mr. President.
Mr. President. Thank you.

Good luck to you, son.

Good luck to you, son.

<i>Both teams are out there with
Dr. Mandela.</i>

Chester, I want you to know that
your whole country is supporting you.

Good luck.
Thank  you, sir.

Good luck, son.
Thank you.

<i>What a dramatic moment here in
Ellis park.</i>

<i>I don't think I've ever seen so many
flags in one stadium.</i>

Hi.
Their captain.

I'm honored, sir.

Mr. President...

Yonah?
Yes. Jonah, sir.

Nice to see you.
Yes. Thank you.

I'm a little afraid of you.

<i>...and that's big Jonah Lomu.</i>

<i>A big day for him.</i>

We're all together now.
Yes.

Good luck.

"Nelson... Nelson... Nelson..."

"NELSON... NELSON... NELSON..."

<i>...Dr. Mandela just lifting his cap
to the sixty-two thousand people....</i>

"Nelson... Nelson... Nelson..."

...wonderful aerial shot of...

<i>...Ellis Park Stadium...</i>

<i>Very emotional moment for both
teams.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the national
anthem of South Africa.</i>

<i>South African National Anthems.</i>

<i>What an unbelievable spectacular
year in Johannesburg.</i>

Perhaps we should make a little
wager.

All your gold, for all our sheep?

Well I was thinking more along the
lines of a case of wine.

<i>The celebration's over. We now come
to the big game.</i>

<i>And we'll wait the Haka of
New Zealand.</i>

<i>...that's the challenge, laid down by

<i>New Zealand as best team gets
in the final of the tournament.</i>

Hey! Get out of here.
Hey!

Put it down!

...knocked him down and stole the
ball...

<i>...put into play by New Zealand.</i>

<i>Now here's the chance for them on
the outside...</i>

Engate.

Right.

Come, boys.

What the heck are we doing?
Lomu is killing us.

Forwards, we must start scrumming.

We must disrupt them at the first
phase.

We can't allow Lomu to get the ball
and space.

He's frickin' killing us.

But listen, if Lomu gets the ball,
whoever is there... James, Joost...

Hit the fucking guy. Hold on to him.
Hold it.

Help will come. Help will be there.

<i>...the big Jonah Lomu and give
him some time and space...</i>

Oh! No!

<i>...most of the opportunities have
gone New Zealand's way...</i>

Go. Go. Go!

Listen up. Captain...

<i>...first blood to New Zealand...</i>

Empty. Thirty four.

<i>...such an important kick for
New Zealand...</i>

<i>... score now: New Zealand 6,
South Africa 3.</i>

<i>...It's a great kick from...</i>

<i>Thirteen minutes gone now. Six points to
three New Zealand beats South Africa.</i>

Come on!

<i>...twenty-one minutes gone now...</i>

<i>...South Africa goes into the lead
for the first time in the match...</i>

<i>...advantage for South Africa 9:6...</i>

<i>...attempt for New Zealand...</i>

Boys. It's all right.

<i>Unsuccessful kick. The score remains
9:9.</i>

<i>...that's closing score nine point
all.</i>

<i>And now, there will be a five
minutes' break.</i>

<i>Twenty final minutes in the World Cup.
We're gonna have an extra time.</i>

<i>Extra time.</i>

So, what does this mean?

Extra time. Twenty minutes.

I don't think I can take it.

<i>Oh, this will be a test of great
character,</i>

<i>in these last twenty minutes of this
match.</i>

Who's the fittest team on this field?

Who's the fittest team on this field?

Engate.

Right.

New Zealand 12, South Africa 9.

<i>xxx in reserve, because...
High, high above the crossbar.</i>

<i>Penalty against green.</i>

Francois...

Too many guys off their feet.

Oh, yes.
Speak to your team.

Okay.

Heads up!

Look in my eyes.

Do you hear?

Listen to your country.

Seven minutes.

Seven minutes.

Defense, defense, defense!

This is it!

This is our destiny.

Come on.

Come.
Come on.

How long before the end?

Seven minutes.

<i>This will be the longest seven
minutes for both two teams.</i>

<i>...can hear the big man coming...</i>

Now!

<i>...has he got 'em?...</i>

<i>...great play there...</i>

Chester, will you lead us in
a prayer?

Thanks Lord, for getting us into
this final.

Thanks for no serious injuries.

and most of all, thanks for the win,
amen.

"Amen"

Good game.

Francois... a few words...

Great game, but you could've done it

without the amazing support of 63,000
South Africans here today.

Ja. We didn't have the support of
63,000 South Africans.

We had the support of 43 million
South Africans.

I want to thank you for what you
have done to our country.

No, Mr. President, thank you for what
you have done for our country.

This route's too crowded.
Change to route C.

Okay.

It's no hurry.

No hurry at all.

Madiba says it's no need to hurry.

"I thank whatever gods may be"

"For my unconquerable soul."

"I am the master of my fate:"

"I am the captain of my soul."
