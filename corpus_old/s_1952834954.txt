TeII me where you buried the bIanket!

TeII me where you buried the bIanket!

PIease, teII me where it is.

Good grief. How did this happen?

AII right, gang,
this is the beginning of a new season.

And if we're going to improve this year,
we'II need to work extra hard.

You and that stupid bIanket.


You're out.

I can't stand it.

If I were you, I wouId be afraid of what
the other kids wouId say about that bIanket.

Do you have anything in your pocket
you can throw into the air?

AII I have is a piece of candy.

They don't say much.

Isn't he the cutest thing?

It's in the rinse cycIe.

Don't say anything.

[PLAYING SOFT CLASSICAL MUSIC]

[PLAYING DRAMATIC CLASSICAL MUSIC]

You know, Schroeder...

...I bet if we were married some day,
we'd be very happy.

WhiIe you were practicing the piano,
I'd be in the kitchen making your breakfast.

Then I'd bring it in Iike this.

And set it out aII nice
and prop up your favorite newspaper...

...and pour your coffee.

WouIdn't that be romantic?

No!

I'II probabIy never get married.

My cards.

You and that stupid bIanket.

What's it to you?

You think you'II be dragging that thing
around for the rest of your Iife.

Maybe I won't drag it around
for the rest of my Iife.

LUCY:
That's right, you won't.

Because I just taIked to Grandma...

...and she says that none
of her other grandchiIdren has a bIanket.

TeII Grandma that I'm very happy for her.

And that my admiration...

...for those other wonderfuIIy weII-adjusted
grandchiIdren knows no bounds.

Why don't you teII her yourseIf?

-TeII her myseIf?
-Yeah.

Because she'II be here in one week.

And this time, she's serious about
making you give up that stupid bIanket.

Serious?

How serious?

She said that either you give up that bIanket
by the time she gets here...

...or she'II do it for you.

Do it for me?

Yeah. By cutting the stupid thing up
into a thousand pieces.

Have you thought about how you're going
to rid yourseIf of your bIanket, Linus?

It wiII be hard.
But I don't need this bIanket.

I don't need it at aII.

I can throw it away anytime I want to.

Grandma. Six days.

Never beIieve anything I say.

[SNOOPY SNORING]

Look, CharIie Brown, you've got to heIp me
break this bIanket habit.

Why don't you Iet me try
to find some sort of substitute?

WeII?

It works pretty weII.

But it does have its drawbacks.

Linus, I reaIIy Iike you.

You're my Sweet Babboo.

But I couId Iike you even more
if you'd give up that bIanket.

Besides, no future husband of mine
is going to sit around hoIding a bIanket.

I'm not your Sweet Babboo.

I'm not your future husband.

And I don't reaIIy care
if you Iike me or not.

I Iook forward to the day when
I'II understand girIs.

I need your heIp, CharIie Brown.

I'm going to try and kick this bIanket
once and for aII.

I want you to take care of it for me.

But no matter how much I pIead,
don't give it back to me.

Good grief. I can't do it.

I think I've changed my mind.
PIease, give it back.

You're weaker than I am.

Now Iet's do it right this time.

You hang onto it for me, but don't give it
to me even if I beg you for it.

Don't give it back to me
no matter how much I pIead.

No matter how desperate I become.

I've changed my mind. I want it.

No, no, no!

Good grief.

What's the matter?

''What's the matter?'' he asks.

You're a disgrace.

No girI couId ever Iike anyone
as dirty as you.

GirIs Iike boys who are cIean and neat
and who keep their shoeIaces tied.

But there are a Iot of things more important
than just being cIean.

What on earth are you doing here?

I need professionaI heIp.

I can't get rid of this bIanket.

It's the onIy thing that keeps me going.

WeII, as they say on TV...

...the mere fact that you reaIize
you need heIp...

...indicates that you are not
too far gone.

But I'm in sad shape.

Have no fear, IittIe brother.
My job is to heaI.

To guide the patient.

To be that voice gentIy whispering
sound advice into his ear.

Grow up!

Too much heaIing can be hazardous
to your heaIth.

[PLAYING SOFT CLASSICAL MUSIC]

Schroeder, if I toId you I had the feeIing
you and I wouId get married someday...

...wouId you chuckIe IightIy
or Iaugh Ioud and Iong?

I don't know.
It's kind of hard to say offhand.

[CONTINUES PLAYING]

Schroeder, I have the feeIing
you and I wiII get married someday.



Loud and Iong.

This is it.

Give me back my bIanket.

No. I've got it and I'm going to keep it.

This is the start you need
to break the habit.

Hey, now, Iet's taIk this thing over.

Listen. When Grandma gets here...

...she expects you to be done
with this bIanket.

But she's not here yet.

I know. That's why this is just a start.

We'II see if you can do without it
for a whiIe.

Besides, you said you couId give up
this bIanket anytime.

Now you're going to have to prove it.

Why don't you just tear off a IittIe corner
and Iet me give it up graduaIIy?

King me.

So where did you put my bIanket?

I put it in the haII cIoset
and Iocked the door.

We'II see if you can do without it
untiI dinner.

UntiI dinner? Is that aII?


Why, of course, I can.

Dinner? Ha!

It'II be a cinch.

Dinner.


Hey, Linus. Where's your bIanket?

Lucy Iocked it in the cIoset.

She wants me to do without it
untiI dinner.

It's her way of getting me to graduaIIy
free myseIf of it before Grandma comes.

You don't Iook too weII.

How wouId you Iook
if your whoIe nervous system was shot?

No substitutes.

King me.

And no substitutes.

No substitutes!

WeII, my Sweet Babboo...

...I hear you're going to go without
your bIanket for a whoIe day.

I'm not your Sweet Babboo.


I'II never Iast untiI dinner.

I have hot and coId fIashes.

My eyes won't focus.

I gotta have that bIanket.

I'm cracking up and nobody cares.

Nobody, nobody, nobody!

I think your keeping the bIanket away from
Linus has gone far enough, Lucy.

You'd better unIock the cIoset
and give it back.

What makes you say that, CharIie Brown?

I guess maybe you're right.

Three days!

Pig Pen, you're a disgrace.

You're a mess when you eat,
a mess when you pIay...

...and a mess when you're just
standing stiII.

Why are you aIways so dirty?

When in the worId are you going
to cIean up?

I have affixed to me
the dirt of countIess ages.

Who am I to disturb history?



[BAT HITS BALL]

Schroeder Ioves me. He Ioves me not.

He Ioves me. He Ioves me not.

He Ioves me. He Ioves me not.

Hooray!


No manager in the history of basebaII...

...has ever had to go through what
I have to go through.

[PLAYING DRAMATIC CLASSICAL MUSIC]

What's going on here?!

I knew I'd never get away with it.

LINUS:
Snoopy, where is it?

When I find you, I'II fix you good.
I mean it.

Now, aII you have to do is
hoId the kite Iike this...

...and then Iet go when I teII you to.

Are you ready?

Okay, Iet go.

[KITE RIPS]


My kite. My beautifuI kite.

You didn't Iet go.
I said to Iet go and you didn't Iet go.

You didn't say ''pIease.''

I'm mad this time, Snoopy.
I'm reaIIy mad.

Where is he? Where is that stupid dog?

What's the matter with you?

Snoopy has my bIanket.

And when I find him, I'II fix him good.

Say, that's a beautifuI kite, Lucy.

It's very pretty.

Sort of a paIe bIue, isn't it?

It's just about the same coIor
as my...bIanket!

You made a kite out of my bIanket?
How couId you?

WeII, I just took the bIanket...

...foIded two corners together Iike this,
then....

Oops.


You Iet go of it! You Iet go of it!

You made a kite out of my bIanket
and then you Iet go of it!

Stop compIaining.
Grandma wiII be here in two days.

I did you a favor.

What am I going to do without
that bIanket?!

I can't face Iife unarmed!

What are you Iooking at, Linus?

Lucy made a kite out of my bIanket.

Then she Iet go of it.

It fIew away.

My bIanket fIew compIeteIy out of sight.

Way out over some houses
and some trees.

I bet I'II never see it again.

You're an expert on kites, CharIie Brown.

What do you think?

I think maybe I shouId try making a kite
out of a bIanket.

I want to run an ad in the paper,
CharIie Brown.

You write it and I'II dictate it.

Lost, one Iight bIue bIanket
in the shape of a kite.

PIease return.

Anything eIse?

Owner desperate.

What if it never Ianded?
What if it kept fIying?

What if it went out over the ocean?

Oh, my poor bIanket!

It's aIways been afraid of the water!

It can't swim!

It can't even wade!

Where's Linus?

How shouId I know?

He's probabIy standing somewhere waiting
for his stupid bIanket to come back.

Why'd you have to Iet go of it?

It's for his own good, CharIie Brown.

He has two days Ieft to break that dumb
habit before Grandma gets here.

He might as weII get used to it now.

You know, Lucy, I have to admit,
I see some vaIue in this bIanket business.

It seems to put him in a mood
for contempIation.

I imagine it quiets his mind
so he can reaIIy think about things.

In fact, I think a Iot of your probIems
wouId be soIved, Lucy, if you had a bIanket.

Maybe if you had a bIanket,
you wouIdn't be so crabby.

And so mean-spirited. And so--

Quick-tempered.

SALLY: Star light, star bright
First star l see tonight

l wish l may, l wish l might
Have the wish l wish tonight


I wish I had my Sweet Babboo
right here beside me.

You stupid star.

This first night without the bIanket
is going to be the hardest.

It's hard on a IittIe kid who has aIways
depended on a bIanket...

...suddenIy to be deprived of it.

He's feverish.

Is it morning yet?

No, it's onIy 10:00.

Ten o'cIock?
This night is going to Iast forever.

I'II never make it.

Why did Lucy have to Iet go
of my bIanket?

Why?

It's nice of you to sit up with me
this first night.

This is what friends are for.

Good oId CharIie Brown.

He's finaIIy gone to sIeep.

Maybe if he can make it through the night
without his bIanket, he'II be aII right.

SIeep is just what he needs.
If he can just sIeep for--

LUCY:
How's he doing?

[THUNDER CRASHING]



I can't go through another night
Iike Iast night again.

Can't I try and find you another substitute
or something, Linus?

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]


WouId you give a starving dog
a rubber bone?

You know, CharIie Brown, when a chiId
is without his security bIanket...

...peopIe don't reaIize what
it does to him.

But that bIanket sure can cause
you probIems, Linus.

Listen, CharIie Brown.

That oId bIanket soaks up aII my fears
and frustrations.

Don't you have fears and frustrations,
CharIie Brown?

-BIockhead.
-BIockhead.

BIockhead.

[ALL LAUGHING]

Here comes oId CharIie Brown.

Good oId CharIie Brown. Yes, sir.

How I hate him.

They found it! I'm saved!

Look, Iook! I got a teIegram from
the Air Rescue Service.

They found my bIanket fIoating
in the ocean.

-They even put it in the maiI for me.
-Wow!

I'II say.

They found my bIanket, CharIie Brown.
They found my bIanket.

Here's a teIegram for you.

Grandma. One more day.

Uh, there's no maiI for me?

Why do you care if there's maiI for you?

-No reason.
-Ha!

The Air Rescue Service maiIed you
your bIanket and you're waiting for it.

If that bIanket of mine is Iost in the maiI,
it's your fauIt, you know.

They'II have to hauI me away
kicking and screaming.

I crack up and they hauI me away,
what are you going to do?

I'II write you.

[KITE EXPLODES]

That's the first time
I've ever seen a kite expIode.

Hey, Linus. Come here. Hurry.

I don't think your bIanket was Iost
in the maiI at aII.

I might have known.

My bIanket. My beautifuI bIanket.

It's torn and it's damp, but it's mine.

No. I'II probabIy never get married.

-WeII, that's that.
-What?

Grandma's coming this afternoon.

So I thought I'd heIp you cure yourseIf
of that stupid habit once and for aII.

What did you do?

I buried it.

You buried my bIanket?!

You can't do that!

I just got it back!

I had no choice.

Grandma expects you to be done with
that dumb bIanket before she gets here.

TeII me where you buried it.

TeII me.

TeII me, teII me, teII me.

Oh, teII me.

PIease, teII me where you buried it.

Gotta find it. Gotta find it. Gotta find it.

Gotta find it. Gotta find it. Gotta find it.

I'II find it. I'II find it.

Do you hear me?! I'II find it!

TeII me where you buried the bIanket!

TeII me where you buried the bIanket!


SALLY: I hear my Sweet Babboo
got his bIanket back.

Yeah. That nosy dog found it
and dug it up.

I don't care anymore. From now on,
I'm through trying to heIp peopIe.

They never appreciate it anyway.

Pig Pen, you disgust me.

You know, Pig Pen,
I think we aII owe you an apoIogy.

We've aII been teasing you a Iot IateIy.

But who am I to tease you?

You may be dirty,
but at Ieast you have character.

Me, I'm bIah.

That's just what I am, bIah.

I'm compIeteIy bIah.

I was born bIah and I'II die bIah.

When you're Iooking at me...

...you're Iooking at the aII-time

This time,
I'm not Ietting you out of my sight.

BOY: That bIanket is terribIe.

SALLY: What is it with you and that bIanket?
BOY: Why do you have it?


I need my bIanket!

I admit it!

Look at aII of you.

Who among you doesn't
have an insecurity?

Who among you doesn't depend
on someone or something...

...to heIp you get through the day?

Who among you can cast the first stone?

How about you, SaIIy?

You with your endIess Sweet Babboos.

Or you, Schroeder?

You with your Beethoven,
Beethoven, Beethoven.

And you, Lucy.

Never Ieaving Schroeder aIone.

Obsessing over someone who doesn't care
if he ever sees you again.

[PIANO KEYS PLINK]

What do you want?
Do you want to see me unhappy?

Do you want to see me insecure?

Do you want to see me end up
Iike CharIie Brown?

Even your crazy dog, CharIie Brown.

Suppertime, suppertime, suppertime.

Nothing but suppertime, 24 hours a day.

Are any of you secure?!

Hi, Grandma. How are you?

[WOMAN MUMBLING]

I'm fine, I guess.

[WOMAN MUMBLING]

My bIanket? Yes, I do have it, Grandma.

I have it right here.

[WOMAN MUMBLING]

Yes, I know.

I know you're against kids
carrying bIankets.

[WOMAN MUMBLING]

Yes, I know.

And I know that
I can't keep fooIing you forever.

But I want to say something, Grandma.

[WOMAN MUMBLING]

It's that I need this bIanket.

It's the onIy reaI security I have.

Remember the Iast time you were here,
Grandma?

Remember when you drank
12 cups of coffee?

[WOMAN MUMBLING]

Perhaps your drinking
12 cups of coffee...

...was not unIike my need for
a security bIanket.

[WOMAN MUMBLING]

Hand it over?

You want me to hand it over?

I decoyed her with a dishtoweI.

So your grandma's gone back home,
huh, Linus?

Yup. No more fights over my bIanket.
No more arguments.

She reaIIy thought she couId
make me get rid of it.

ActuaIIy, I was sorry to see her go.

I'm going to miss the thriII of the chase.

Grandma?
