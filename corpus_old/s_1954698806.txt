          <i> Make It Pop.</i>

      <i> The air conditioning</i>
    <i> system has malfunctioned</i>

           and sprung
             a leak.

             Who is
      responsible for this?

     I don't think I've ever
    seen you and masked girl

        in the same place
        at the same time.

        I'm Masked Girl.

   <i> â™ª Ever, ever, ever, ever â™ª</i>

          It was you!?

       You're Masked Girl!

          And you lied
         to me about it?

     I wanted to tell you--

        --but you didn't.

             Jared.

          I don't want
       to hear it, Corki.

   You know, I don't know what
   could hurt more than this.

   Except maybe this hangnail
    that's been keeping me up

         at night. but,
   that's a whole other story.

             Drama.

           And not the
          kind I teach.

     <i> This is the all clear.</i>

      <i> I repeat, all clear.</i>

    <i> Students, please return</i>
    <i> to your original rooms.</i>

          Social order
       has been restored!

   <i> Okay everyone, the sooner</i>
   <i> you get back to your rooms</i>

    <i> the sooner I can have a</i>
    <i> hot bath and contemplate</i>

        my life choices!

         Okay, let's go.

             Nice going, newbie.

           Jared is so
         done with you.

            Oh yeah?

  We'll see who he likes better
    when my girl locks a spot

      on Homecoming Court.

What?

                   That's right!

 Kiss the crown goodbye, because
   Corki is going all the way.

          Right, Corki?

               Um.

 She's still getting the hang of
 the whole witty-comeback-thing.

   Sharpen your pencil, Corki.

         Because you're
     about to get schooled.

        Yeah, well, maybe
    I enjoy getting schooled

        Because I value a
         good education.

           It was a good effort.

              She'll work on it.

        You really think
         this will work?

It has to.

If we let Valerie
tell us what to do,

we'll spend high school
in almost cool limbo.

And I am not
almost anything.

        Hear that, girls?

   It's the sound of a someone
    not making an impression

       on student voters.

          You're out of
       your league, Corki.

         No freshman has
      ever beaten a senior

         and you're not
     going to be the first!

    â™ª Make it pop! Woo, Woo â™ª

    â™ª Make it pop! Woo, Wooâ™ª

      â™ª I can't wait, no â™ª

      â™ª I can't wait, no â™ª

       â™ª I can't wait no,
 I can't wait no, I can't wait â™ª

      â™ª So, make it pop! â™ª

        â™ª We're bout to,
      we're bout to blow! â™ª

     â™ª Wait till we drop! â™ª

           â™ª Oh yeah,
       we're ready to go â™ª

    â™ª Ain't gonna stop, when
   is it time for the show? â™ª

   â™ª We make it, you make it,
          we make it â™ª

          â™ª M-m-m-m-m-
         make it pop! â™ª

<i>Why is</i>
       <i> Valerie like that?</i>

Deep-seeded
insecurities stemming

from a
perfect childhood.

            That makes no sense.

      It makes total sense.

       All perfect people
      are hiding something!

              I thought you said
               you were perfect.

             I'm the
     exception to the rule.

                  Don't worry
                  about Valerie.

   She's just jealous because
     you might actually win.

     But it was Masked Girl
    who was popular, not me.

            We're not
        giving up, Corki.

We just need a
brilliant campaign,

      which means we need a
   brilliant campaign manager,

           which means
           we need me.

         You guys really
     think I stand a chance?

        Of course you do.

     You just need a total,
        irrational belief

       that everything you
         do is awesome,

      no matter the reality
        of the situation.

               That's called
               being delusional.

       Nooooo, it's called
        being a dreamer.

         Or a web celeb.

                  Or delusional.

                 A little higher
                 on the left.

                         <i> Right.</i>

                        Heather!

                             No!

       When I said "right"
   I mean the left is correct.

        This is my left.

    I know because it has my
      left bracelet on it.

             Right!

          I remember my
        homecoming days,

     when we would re-unite,
partake in gluttonous endeavors,

            frolic in
        the fall leaves.

            No one's
        listening to me.

          Lovely job on
      the banner, Heather.

           Keep it up.

     Mr. Stark, that's what
        the rope is for.

         Let's give this
           a test run.

Ouuu!

      Thank you, thank you,
        you're too kind.

    Of course I'll autograph
     that for you, Heather.

       Um, Valerie, that's
        permanent marker.

           Lucky you!

           I love it!

<i>This is</i>
          <i> a disaster!</i>

        I just received a
    last minute cancellation

     from the Homecoming DJ.

   <i> I think we have different</i>
    <i> definitions of disaster</i>

           Mr. Stark,
     earthquakes, monsoons,

           dates that
         dine and dash,

              What?

              What?

      Those are disasters.

But without music, how will they
   be overtaken by the rhythm.

    They'll just dance like--

        Eeeehhhh, eeeeh!

             --that.

         Please don't do
       that in my office.

      Just find another DJ.

              But--

         You can go now.

                  This paint job
                  is ugh,

                     It's really
                     something.

       Man, where did
        Mr. Stark go?

           Hey Caleb!

          Oh hey, Jodi.

         How's it goin'?

          Hey, have you
         seen Mr. Stark?

               No.

          So, listen...

   I've been thinking and the
    homecoming dance is soon,

       so, since I'm going
       and you're going--

   Hey, you know what, this is
      great small talk but,

       I really gotta go!

                 Corki,
                 for homecoming!

This is what it
takes to win.

   Posters, buttons an online
     campaign at warp speed.

I'm averaging 75 new
fans an hour.

    And people laughed at my
    daily finger excersises.

   If we play this right, you
    could be crowned a queen,

     in a Jodi Mapa design.

            You really think so?

       â™ª We're gonna take
     down the whole system â™ª

        â™ª Right now we're

                  Let's do this!

                         Button?

      Corki for Homecoming,
       get a free button!

                   I'm so sorry.

It's okay.

           I mean it.

           I am sorry.

      I never meant to
         lie to you,

   I just couldn't let anyone
know it was me behind that mask.

              Why?

          I can't say.

  It's kind of like how I never
      tell anyone about the

 black-and-white artsy photos of
   flowers I take on weekends.

             You do?

    Let's change the subject.

      Too much information.

            Would you
         wear my button?

              Sure.

      So apology accepted?

        I'm a bigger man
       than most, so yes.

        Nobody's perfect.

        Even Masked Girl?

          Now you'll be
     looking at me all day.

   Especially my chin region.

  Mr. Stark, I've been looking
       for you everywhere.

          I heard your
        DJ bailed on you.

              Hmm.

      No, Come on, I've got
       tons of experience.

            Two years
         as a house DJ.

       Impressive, where?

      My family's basement,
      I went on every night

      and my Nana loved it.

   Well, DJ'ing a MacKendrick
         Prep homecoming

      is a different beast
      entirely, Mr. Davis.

  It's about striking a balance
   between old and new music,

      Mmm, catering to all
       tastes and styles--

              I'll play at least
              10% show tunes.

Twenty.

                        Fifteen.

Welcome to the prestigious
world of a high school DJ.

                            Yes!

Ahem!

Stop that.

Stop that, don't.

Hmph!

    My campaign is working--
  people are talking about you.

   That doesn't look like the
 friendly kind of talk we want.

They're nervous.

Probably too awestruck
to meet you in person.

          Hey, newbie.

          Nice try with
          the campaign.

That Masked-Girl-thing was cute,
    but it's so two-days-ago.

        Better luck when
        you're a senior.

                         Sun Hi!

                 We have to
                 get those down!

          Don't worry.

        No way that many
   people have seen them yet.

     Well this looks like an
    inordinately large amount

          of equipment.

   I'm going to make this the
best Homecoming ever, Mr. Stark.

      I just need access to
      the main power system

 so I can connect my subwoofers
   to the tactile transducers.

Caleb. I'm hearing a lot of
"Untz Untz Untz"

But I what I wanna be hearing
5-6-7-8, ta-ta, ta-ta,

     annnnnnddd jazz hands!

  You're not familiar with the
   "Caleb Sound Effect Theory"

          where more is
        better, are you?

               No.

  You will be, then you'll know
   I'm the man to do music for

   The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

      One thing at a time,
           Mr. Davis.

      One thing at a time.

       Caleb, I'm going to
     the dance this Friday,

     and I'm going with you.

             Got it?

      Wow, that felt good.

              Jodi, I don't know
              what to say.

If you know
what's good for you,

  you'll say that you've never
     felt more excited about

anything in your life.

     I'd like to say that--

       But I can't be your
      date, I'm DJ-ing it.

        You got the gig?

       Pretty cool, right?

              Yeah.

      That's great, Caleb.

             Thanks.

     So technically we'll be
     at the dance together--

           Just not--

            together.

  Hey, let me know if you have
    any song requests, okay?

         Sure, will do!

           If that was
         any indication,

       it would have been
      fun dancing with you.

    This Homecoming election

    shouldn't be about cheap
      mudslinging tactics.

       It should be about
      character and ethics.

   That's why, moving forward,
   I will continue to conduct

        my campaign with
    integrity and positivity.

   Because it's the right way,
     it's the honorable way,

            it's the
      MacKendrick Prep way.

           Thank you.

     I see you're using the
 personal touch and reaching out

          to the voters
         one at a time.

Um Val,
there's a door there.

             Look on
        the bright side.

       No one saw her make
      fun of you this time.

          I'm quitting.

                 You can't quit!

  Someone needs to show Valerie
    and her peppy goon squad

          that how they
       behave isn't cool.

      I don't want to prove
      anything to Valerie.

         I just want to
        be a nice person.

        Didn't you listen
          to my speech?

        Of course I did.

          It was about
       Homecoming, right?

 Look, I know you mean well, but
   every time you try to help,

        the Spirit Squad
        just get weirder.

         I know, right?

       We're a good team.

              Ugh!

      If Caleb won't go to
       the dance with me,

           at least my
       dress can be there.

         Maybe, I should
            take you.

       A couple of dummies
       on the dance floor.

          Why did I ask
       Caleb to the dance?

       What are you doing?

         Definitely not
       hugging this dummy.

Hey, check this out.

          This dress is
         gonna be sick!

 It's my statement that I don't
 care about going to Homecoming.

      I'm not going either.

             What?!

     That means my statement
 about not going won't be going!

             Arghhh.

           Move over.

             Arghh!

             Selfie!

              Ahh!

         What'd I miss?

            Neither of us is
            going to Homecoming.

        Ugh, yes you are.

  We still have a shot at this
  thing, nothing is impossible.

         Except kissing
         your own elbow.

     Believe me, I've tried.

Good pep talk,
Sun Hi.

Especially the part that made me
 picture you kissing your elbow.

            Sad song.

              Yeah.

     It's an original piece.

  "Literal Interpretation of My
    Current Emotional State."

             Catchy.

      Things that bad, huh?

     I don't want to run for
    Homecoming Court anymore.

      Well, if that's what
       you think is best.

         Too bad though.

     I was coming around to
     the idea of you and me

          on Homecoming
         Court together.

            You were?

         Uh-oh, too much
          information.

           I gotta go.

  I talked to Jared, I'm going
      to stay in the race.

That's great,
Corki.

At least my
dress will be there.

         Oh, no, Corki.

     Your campaign to become
    invisible in this school,

    <i> didn't exactly work out.</i>

      I can still see you!

      Sun Hi, don't do it.

              Argh.

      Fine, If that's what
        you want, Corki.

   I guess sometimes in life,
 it's best to just admit defeat

         and walk away.

            Glad you
      finally smartened up.

     I'm impressed, Sun Hi.

           You handled
       that very maturely.

Our little girl
is growing up.

              It was bound to
              happen eventually.

             Or not.

              You.

Oh Valerie!

You match
your bathrobe!

        This isn't over!

   I guess the guy at the joke
      Store wasn't kidding

     when he said, a little
        goes a long way.

  Sun Hi, I told you this isn't
  how I want to conduct myself.

    I'm not like them, I want
    to stay true to who I am

       and what I believe
         no matter what.

          It's time you
     start respecting that.

                  It washes off.

                     Eventually.

Check it out, some
    Corki fans in the crowd.

         I'm gonna need
           more power.

     It'll be fun to see you
  get on the Homecoming court.

            You mean
         you're coming?

              Yeah.

         I don't need a
        date to have fun.

          Great, Jodi.

         Just don't plan
        on talking to me.

 I'll be busy getting mobbed by
 fans after my solo performance.

       And then Mr. Stark
    will cast me as Dorothy,

          and my career
        will be launched.

          Ah, it's good
            to be me.

   This could end up being an
  awesome Homecoming after all.

         What was that?

      That would be another
        safety violation.
