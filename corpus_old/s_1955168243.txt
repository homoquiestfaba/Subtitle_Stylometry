    Dr. Lane:<i> Hello, Sharon.</i>

           And Nolan.

I am really happy that you could
  meet with me this afternoon.

       I understand that
      you gave your mother

  quite a scare two days ago.

        And I was hoping
  that you could share with me

       what you remember
      about that evening.

      Well, I can tell you
       that it was by far

the scariest moment in my life.

       Both of our lives
     passed before my eyes.

       My son is the most
       important thing--

 Sharon, you know, we have had

         an opportunity
       to talk about this

and you told me what you believe
    led up to these events,

       but, Nolan, I want
       to hear from you.

     All right, then let me
  start with an introduction.

 My name is Dr. Cassandra Lane
        and I have been

   a practicing psychiatrist
      for nearly 18 years.

        I have been with
      this hospital for...

    about 11 of those years
    specializing in juvenile

      and young adults who
    are considered at risk.

              So.

      Could you tell me a
     little bit about you?

   Commentator:<i> The home side</i>
        <i> is going now,</i>

      <i> crowds loving it,</i>
       <i> now the big guy.</i>

   <i> Hitting .342 with 92 RBI</i>

        <i> and 36 homers.</i>

        (cheering on TV)

    Okay, honey, your dinner
  is wrapped in the microwave,

   the timer is set, all you
   have to do is press start.

             Nolan.

    Are you listening to me?

   Dinner's in the microwave,
          press start.

     Emergency numbers are
      on the refrigerator,

       don't go outside,

 don't answer the phone unless
    I hear the special ring,

       and don't open the
      door for strangers.

    Okay smarty pants.

   I'll call you on my break.
          I love you.

       Love you too, Mom.

          Commentator:
   <i> Three, we're tied at two.</i>

     <i> More baseball after</i>
       <i> these messages.</i>

       Hey, what are you
       doing back there?

    Nothin', just wanted to
  see if I could play with ya.

       Are you any good?

           -I guess.
         -Here, catch!

     Throw it back, doofus.

          Boy: My lip!

       You busted my lip!

      I'm gonna kill you.

           Grab him!

        Hey, watch where
     you're going, stupid!

         You shouldn't
      have been in my way,

     you little shit, move!

     What did you call me?

         -You heard me.
          -(laughing)

     -What did you call me?
   -Man: Hey, hey, hey, hey!

   Break it up, break it up!

         He started it!

      Well, I'm ending it.

        All of you guys,
      get outta here, now.

         It's not over,
       you little freak.

           Man: Sam.

           Sam! Son?

        Come back here.

           Hey, hey.

       What do you want?

Thanks for sticking up for me.

    I didn't do it for you.

       Where do you play?

             What?

        Wherever I want.

    No one can tell me where
      to go or what to do.

       I'm going down to
    the batting diamond.

          Can I come?

      It's a free country.

        Sam: All right,
    let's see what you got.

              Wow.

    I'm not that good.

    You can say that again.

         Try it again.

  And this time, concentrate.

       For Christ's sake,
         what was that?

            I quit.

         I should play
     football or something.

 I saw the way you were running

      when those assholes
        were after you.

         Football ain't
       your sport either.

          Now come on,

  we're gonna toss this thing
    until you get it right.

       You would do that?

       If you're going to
      hang around with me,

        I can't have you
     throwing like a girl.

           (applause)

     Coach: Come on, Nolan.

           (applause)

  -Coach: Nice, there you go!
          -(applause)

        Coach: Atta boy!

      Mountaineers, baby.
         Good job boys!

           Good job!

       You keep this up,

       and you just might
        hold that trophy

   at the end of the season.

          Team: Yeah!

    With Nolan's arm, coach,
   there's no might about it.

         No, this ain't
        no one-man show.

       We, we are a team.

      -That's right coach.
         -Coach: Yeah.

  And remember, there is no...

      Team: ...I in team.

              Aww.

             -Aww.
          -(laughter)

     Go on, get outta here.

  Get outta here, you deserve
      an extra free night.

     -Nolan: Thanks Coach!
       -Coach: Good job.

    Teacher: Show of hands.

       Who read Act Two,
    scenes one through four?

       All right, so what
       did you conclude?

     One at a time, please.

    What was that, Nolan?
       I didn't hear you.

              Sir?

 What do you think Romeo meant

          when he said
    "I have a soul of lead,

    that so sticks me to the
    ground I cannot move."?

  Well, clearly, he's in love.

          How's that?

He says "I have a soul of lead."

    Doesn't sound like love.

    Well, his heart is heavy
     and he doesn't want...

         He can't move.

  See, I think he's paralyzed
      by his overwhelming

   love for this girl and...

  Because of that, he doesn't
    wanna lose sight of her.

            Teacher:
Excellent interpretation, Nolan.

           Very nice.

           Very nice.

           Pop quiz.

              Hey.

              Hey.

    Um, so, I was wondering.

        Wondering what?

      I was just wondering
         if you'd like

to come to my game on Saturday?

        You play sports?

          (chuckling)

    Hmm, you don't look
    like a football player.

   And judging by your arms,

       you're definitely
        not a wrestler.

             Wait.

      Are you that pitcher
 everyone's been talking about?

      Aww, that's too bad.

     I was hoping you were
       a football player,

       because baseball's
        just so boring.

     I'll see ya in class.

     <i> I am never gonna let</i>
     <i> him hurt you again.</i>

     Do you hear me, baby?

        He will never,
      ever hurt you again.

 Daniel:<i> Open this door Sharon,</i>

  <i> or I'm gonna break it down.</i>

       <i> -I swear to God!</i>
          -(crashing)

        Sharon:<i> Daniel,</i>
 <i> you're drunk, leave us alone!</i>

      (indistinct chatter)

          Hey, fence.

           (laughing)

        Really, really?

        All right, break
      it up, break it up.

         Hey, nice save
       today, Tommy boy.

   -That was good stuff, man.
            -Thanks.

 You actually totally saved us.

   Sure I did, everyone knows
    you got that rubber arm,

so it must be that lucky glove.

         Hey, remember,
     there's no I in team.

         -No I in team.
          -(laughing)

      You guys are crazy.

       Hey, so, we gonna
     party tonight or what?

    Parents are outta town,
      so I got the pickup.

       That's what's up!

       Guys, let me talk
        to my mom first.

     I'll catch up with you
    guys in a minute, okay?

     Yeah, yeah, mama boy.

        Remember tonight
    we're going to a party.

           (laughing)

         I'm after you.

           Hey, Mom?

       Oh, let me guess,

         you wanna hang
       out with the guys?

            You know
     everything, don't you?

   Sometimes I feel like you
    got like psychic powers

or something, it's kinda creepy.

       Yeah, I just know
    what "Hey, Mom?" means.

You sure that you wanna pass up

  on my world-famous meatloaf?

         Mom, it's just
       me and you though.

   It's not like there's some
other guy joining us for dinner.

 Look, I'll probably be hungry
    when I get home anyway,

     so just leave a plate
    in the microwave for me?

             -Okay.
        -Love you, Mom.

           Love you.

          Hey, Nolan?

        Oh, thanks Mom.

        You're welcome.

       Dude, I don't know
     about this, all right?

 Oh, my gosh, Thomas, shut up!

    If I want your opinion,
     I will give it to you.

       We don't even know
        who this guy is.

      I told you already,
     we did time together.

  In the third family, before
   the wanker family got me.

      He looks out for me.

       Relax man, I know
        what I'm doing.

            (laughs)

   -Hey, dude, put that down.
    -Just relax, it's fine.

       -Sam, put it down.
           -Shut up!

 Hey, put that shit down, man!

            Spence:
 Man, y'all boys in luck, man.

       Check it out, man.

         I got some...

     Got some Purple Haze.

        Got some Skunk.

   You know I got that Molly.

           (laughing)

    Got a bottle of 'Contin.

         Well, shit, if
      y'all real serious,

       got a few packets
      of that bling bling.

           Sam: Yeah.

      And some fine China
   that my boy traded me for.

             Hello?

    You act like y'all ain't
    never seen drugs before.

   Y'all have partied, right?

        -Yeah, we party.
  -Yeah, we party, right guys?

      Man, I ain't talkin'
         no pot, girls.

      Everybody smoke bud.

      Shit, even my lawyer
        burned it down.

       I'm talking about
        the type of shit

     that'll make you fly.

        Well, we haven't
      tried any of those.

           -Man it...
     -Sam: Tommy, shut up.

      Is Spence gonna have
     to babysit you girls?

        How much scratch
       y'all puttin' up?

        Scratch, dough,
     moolah, bread, money.

              -Oh.
          -Tommy: Oh.

          One second.

         I've got $32.

         What you got?

            I got...

           I got $60.

          $32 and $60.

    Where's your money, Sam?

       -I don't have any.
       -Are you serious?

     I'll get it next time,
           it's cool.

            -Really?
     -Don't worry about it.

    Nah, nah, it's cool man.

That ain't bad, that ain't bad.

        Sam: Let's divvy
        up these sticks!

         Let's see, one
       for each of y'all.

        All right, let's
     see these real quick.

       All right, Thomas,
       you get this one.

         All right, you
       get this one here.

       Tell ya what, hook
     him up first, my man.

    Spence: Uh-uh, the tip,

  burn the tip first, brother.

      Burn the tip first.

           By itself?

  Spence: Burn the tip first.

     All right, all right.

Spence: Spin it around, man.
You know I like rotisserie, man.

        (Spence laughs)

             Yeah.

          -(coughing)
          -(laughing)

  Sam: The party has started.

       Yeah. Light it up!

           (coughing)

           (laughing)

   Get 'im, get 'im, Thomas!

          Where is he?

     -Don't worry about it.
     -Change your tampons.

      That's my boy, Fred.

          All right,
   There he is, there he is.

         Look at this,
       look at it, look.

          Whoa, whoa.

   It's time to go, let's go.

       We just got here,
       shut the fuck up.

            Already?

             Yeah.

        Sam: Hey, Nolan.

   You're such a lightweight.

      Passed out already.

    Nolan: All right, later.

           (laughing)

           Sam: Safe!

           Hey, hey.

      Tell your mom I said
     "What's up,<i> Mamacita?"</i>

          I love you!

Ready, Thomas? Here we go, baby!

          Okay, Nolan.

All right, you know what,

  we're gonna just talk about
   this in the morning, okay?

        No, I know, Mom.

  -Hey, have I ever told you?
             -What?

 That you are my favorite girl

      in the entire world?

           Thank you.

    Let's aim for bed, okay?

          You got it?

            (sighs)

         (pan sizzling)

        You should eat.

           (sighing)

        I want a shower.

    Tommy: I feel like shit.

   Yeah, I pitched like shit.

  Sam: You can say that again.

         Last night was
      pretty crazy, guys.

     But it was fun, right?

            (laughs)

      If I could get this
    pounding out of my head.

 I think they make some kind of

       a hemorrhoid cream
     for that, don't they?

          -I'm sorry?
      -Sam: You heard me.

          (Sam laughs)
            (groans)

  -Tommy: That's what you get.
         -Sam: Thomas.

  I think those were the first
 balls you hit all day, homie.

    Thomas: Really? Really?

           Hey, Sam,
     you know what I heard?

           Sam: What?

 Your mom hits a lot of balls.

   Really, who told you that?

       I didn't hear it,
      I found out myself.

      Really, really, huh?

          -Dehra: Hey.
             -Hey.

     Two creams, one sugar?

      Oh, God, thank you.

        You're welcome.
       How's Mrs. Kanda?

        In and out.

   You know they're offering
  overtime for the next shift.

     I have not had a good
   night's sleep in a month.

       Same here, but...

   With three boys and Jeff,

        I need all those
        hours I can get.

       Hey, how's Nolan?

        Sorry I couldn't
      make it to the game.

      Jordan got a fever.

         I heard Nolan
     really put a spankin'

  on them Clayton County boys.

           (laughing)

        He was terrific.

        I was so proud.

    Till he came home in the
  middle of the night, drunk.

       Oh. Is that what I
    have to look forward to?

       That is the least
        of your worries.

            Thanks.

        Hey, when you're
        done with that,

 can I have the overtime sheet?

        Done. All yours.

            Awesome.

            -Mm-hmm.
          -Three days?

Dehra: Honey, I got three boys.

           -I don't.
      -Dehra: Hungry boys.

           (cheering)

        Let's go, Nolan!

        Come on, Nolan!

          -(cheering)
   -Coach: Hey, there ya go!

             Yeah.

   Come on baby, push, push!

       Push Nolan, push!

          Yeah, safe!

      There ya go, Nolan!

           (cheering)

       There ya go, baby!

           (laughing)

   Way to go guys, way to go.

Way to go, way to go, way to go.

        All right.
           All right.

  Hey, nice meeting you guys.

   See you in a second, yeah.

              Hey.

          So you uh...

Still think baseball is boring?

        Did I say that?

        You need to put
       ice on this later.

           Yeah. Oh.

      Mom, this is Rachel.

    My second biggest fan.

          -Hi, Miss...
       -Sharon: Adamson.

      It is a pleasure to
       meet you, Rachel.

And I'm assuming that you're not

      gonna be celebrating
     like last week, right?

 Well, actually, I was thinking
   of going to catch a movie.

     If only I knew someone
        to accompany me.

  Is that how guys ask today?

           (giggles)

My gosh, the ego on this child.

 I raised you better than that.

             -Mom.
        -Don't "Mom" me.

           (sighing)

  Rachel, would you like to go
  see a movie with me tonight?

        I would love to.

          Much better.

 It was a pleasure to meet you.

     Nice to meet you too,
         Mrs. Adamson.

 I don't care how big you get,
you'll always be my little boy.

      I'll be at the car.

 She's always embarrassing me.

     Doesn't every mother?

    She means well, I guess.

        Gotta love her.

             So...

   Pick you up around seven?

         Don't wash it.

         Don't wash it.

           Nolan, oh!

Nolan's got a girlfriend.

   Nolan's got a girlfriend.

        Man, shut up.

           (laughing)

   Did she really just write
    her number on your hand?

             -Yeah.
         -Oh, my word.

        Hey, so are you
     still on for tonight?

              No.

      Dude, I have plans.

     We were gonna go out.

      Sam. It's one night.

        And I'll let you
       know how it goes.

  Mom, I need my jeans ironed!

  And my blue shirt, you know,
the one with the button missing.

           (spitting)

          (yells) Mom!

     Thank you, I love you.

  Hey, Thomas, what's up man?

<i>What's going on over there?</i>

        It's my sister's
        birthday party.

      She just turned 10.

      (indistinct chatter)

     Hey, what time is this
      princess party over?

 Not for another couple hours.

      What the hell, man?

        Can't you leave
      early or something?

            <i> Nah.</i>

 Plus my dad caught me sneaking
    into the liquor cabinet,

        so grounded from
        using the truck.

 Thomas, you are such a douche.

       What the hell am I
      supposed to do now?

       You can go play in
    traffic for all I care.

          I gotta go.

          -Hey, Pops?
           -Dad: No.

         You don't know
      what I'm gonna ask.

          Oh, I know.

   Look, I just wanna borrow
the car for a couple of hours

      to go meet the boys
     for burgers at Dick's.

          Not tonight,
      Annalise is cooking,

 I don't wanna hear her mouth.

      Woah! What the hell?

    Hold on to the freaking
        ball, you idiot!

   (sports commentary on TV)

  Hey, why don't you sit down
here and watch the game with me?

     I mean, you're always
    holing up in that room.

          Commentator:
     <i> Fumbled! Recovered!</i>

         Like you care.

        What'd you say?

    -Commentator:<i> Touchdown!</i>
             -Yes!

      Yes, yes, yes, yes!

 Yes! That's the way to do it!

          Hello, Sir.

       You must be Dylan.

       No sir, I'm Nolan.

             Nolan?

            (laughs)
   I'm just kidding ya, kid.

     Rachel: That's enough.

      Hey, all right, all
      right, put it there.

            Mm-hmm.

          -You ready?
             -Yeah.

 It was great meeting you, sir.

     Pleasure was all mine.

  I hear you the strongest arm
        in the country?

     Bet you the recruiters
       are all after ya.

        Yes sir, I guess
      you could say that.

             Yeah?

    Did my daughter tell you
   I am the Athletic Director
          over at GTI?

     -No, sir, she didn't.
          -She didn't?

             Daddy.

      Can I at least know
      if I like him before

      you start recruiting
     him for your program?

           (chuckles)
 Y'all kids have a good night.

        -Thank you, Sir.
            -Mm-hmm.

           After you.

Have a good night, see you soon.

        Man 1: (on film)
   <i> Stay right where ya are.</i>

         <i> Don't move.</i>

   <i> Stay there now, steady.</i>

            <i> Now...</i>

       (tires screeching)

            -(crash)
        -Sam: Oh, shit.

   Pick up, pick up, pick up.

            Come on!

 Come on Nolan, come on, Nolan.

      (cell phone buzzing)

        Man 2: (on film)
    <i> Boss! Oh, Boss! Fuck!</i>

        Man 1: (on film)
<i>Take it easy, what's the matter?</i>

      (cell phone buzzing)

            (sighs)

            Come on.

      (cell phone buzzing)

 Hey, I'll be right back, okay?

        Man 1: (on film)
   <i> I can't understand why you</i>

   <i> have this terrible fear of</i>
  <i> animals in you. What is it?</i>

        Man 2: (on film)
   <i> When I was a little baby,</i>

 <i> I was scared by my piggy bank.</i>

        What is it, Sam?

        Bro, hey, Nolan,
    I'm on Pike Street, man.

  I just wrecked my dad's car.

        Goddamn it, Sam.

 I don't know what to do, man.

   I need you here right now.

     Sam:<i> Just hurry, okay?</i>

All right, I'll be right there.

            (sighs)

    What are you doing, Sam?

      What if someone sees
        you, what the...

      I'm already screwed,
      what does it matter?

 Sam, come on, get off the car.

  Come on, let's go, get off.

   And cut this shit out too.

       Go get in my car.

              Sam.

        We're just gonna
        leave this here?

 Yes, we're just gonna leave it
    here for an hour or so.

 We could say someone stole it.

           Stole it?

  What are you talking about?

 What the fuck are you saying?

Stole it? It's right here.

 We're not gonna say shit, Sam.

        What we're gonna
       do is we're gonna

   get in my car, we're gonna
    drive back to my house,

     drop it off, run back
       here, and then...

       Call the cops and
        say that someone

         ran us off the
       road or something.

      I've been drinking.

      Okay? They're gonna
        send me to juvi.

   Damn it, are you serious?

       Oh, my God. Shit.

        All right, look.
          God damn it.

           Chew this.

    I'll say I was driving.

     You'd do that for me?

         Yeah, I would.

    No more screw-ups, Sam.

 I swear bro, you have my word.

     Look at me. I mean it.

           All right.

        Get your fuckin'
    hands off me. Let's go.

  Police Officer: So you mean
     to tell me you didn't

     get a good description
        of the vehicle?

      No, it was too dark.

 I think it was a pickup truck.

 The lights were really bright

         and they were
   shining down on us, so...

        What about you?

        He was driving,
    I was just riding along.

              Hmm.

       We'll see what we
      gotta do about this.

         What the hell
    were you thinking?

  I should beat the shit outta
   you for stealing the car!

        Do you know what
       could've happened?

       Ma'am, I need you
      to calm down, okay?

 Look, I know you're upset and
 I understand why you're upset.

        I swear to God,
   if this was your fault...

       Annalisa, shut up.

      Annalisa: What? I've
     had it with this kid!

 He-- we are calling the state
  first thing in the morning!

   I've gotta cook and clean,
   take care of a foster kid,

   and keep this house going.
      I need that to work!

       Sam's dad: Listen,
      wash dishes by hand,

    you know that's the way
     people used to do it.

      Annalisa: Well, gee,
    I would take some money

       and hire to get it
      fixed but you bought

      -the kid a new mitt!
     -Dad: I've had enough.

I've had enough, I'm outta here!

        Annalisa: Don't
     you walk away from me.

      Sam's dad: Goodbye!

        Annalisa: Don't
     you walk away from me!

    And what are you lookin'
      at, you little shit?

           Sam's dad:
    Get back in the car now.

       So you're not the
   parents of this young man?

   We're his foster parents.

       Boys will be boys.
             Right?

        I mean, he's not
       a bad kid, really.

    He did say his friend
    was driving the vehicle,

        and someone ran
       them off the road.

   It actually happened to me
  when I was around their age.

      Towing company will
        be here shortly.

Stay out of trouble, all right?

      Have a good evening.

       Is everybody okay?

 I don't understand, I thought
 you were going to the movies.

   Bill, I am-- I'm so sorry,

       just give me your
     insurance information

      and I promise I will
    take care of everything.

    There's nothing here the
insurance company can't handle.

           Thank you.

            Come on.

             Pops.

       I'm really sorry.

              -Hi.
             -Hey.

           What's up?

     Just waiting for you.

      -Yeah, by my locker.
             -Yeah.

         -Is that okay?
             -Yeah.

        I like that.

         You want me to
        take your stuff?

         Rachel: Sure.

       How was your day?

          Well, long.

  Yeah, I feel that, for sure.

             Yeah.

  Yeah. It's nice to see you.

            You too.

     Hey, how are you doing
    in Mr. Lodholtz's class?

         I don't know.

        I just need a C.

             -A C?
             -Yeah.

           It's hard.

 Yeah, I know. I'm telling you.

 I'm not doing too good either.

             What?

         Yeah, all this
    simile, metaphor stuff,

the classic versus contemporary,
     it's kicking my butt.

            -Really?
            -Mm-hmm.

      That's weird because
        I could've sworn

     that I saw your grade
      on last week's exam

       and you got an A.

              Yes.

        Yes, I did.

  It's hard though, I mean...

           -Shut up.
          -(laughing)

       -You wanna study?
             -Yeah.

             -Yeah.
             -I do.

        You busy today?

              No.

   Coach:<i> What I just saw out</i>
     <i> there on that field</i>

        was despicable!

    That's not what we are!

 We don't play ball like that!

You wanna be hoodlums and thugs,

   take it out on the street!

       Because you're not
       gonna do it here!

    I will bench your asses!

    One-by-one if I have to.

         He started it.

       You got something
      you wanna say, Sam?

    Then get outta my sight.

You're sacked for two games.

   Nolan and Sam: But coach.

       Nolan, you're this
     close to joining him.

   You know, and as for you,
     the ump shared with me

what was going on at the plate.

            Mm-hmm.

    If I hear anything about
     that happening again,

     you are off the team.

    Do I make myself clear?

           Yes, sir.

      So the rest of you,
    6:00 am, you got poles.

             Nolan.

            I know.

            I know.

            (sighs)

          Nah. I don't
       think you do know.

       Are you willing to
      sacrifice everything

   you've accomplished out of
   the loyalty for a friend?

Coach, he's not just my friend,
        he's my brother.

He's what's gotten me this far.

I can't just turn my back on him

      because he fouls up
      every now and then.

              Son.

   You have a God-given gift.

   It was gonna reveal itself

 whether Sam had any influence
            or not.

       You came into this
       world by yourself,

      more than likely you
    will leave by yourself.

     Nowhere is it written
     that you owe it to Sam

  to sacrifice your hard work,
          your talent,

  your opportunities for him.

     Coach, you don't know
    how hard Sam has had it.

         Is having it.

       I understand him.

      Let me talk to him,
       he listens to me.

         Yeah, well...

 Son one day you're gonna learn
 that you can't save everybody.

  -Especially from themselves.
            -Coach.

           I'm sorry,
    but you've got it wrong.

       Sam is a good guy,

      he needs somebody to
       keep him on track.

And if you can't do it, then...

             -Hey.
   -Hey, what did Coach say?

            Nothin.

          Come on man,
      don't be like that.

    Not now Sam, all right?

        Well, screw you.

           Screw me?

            Really?

       We agreed no more
        shit, remember?

      God, how many times
    do I have to put my ass

 out on the line for you, Sam?

   You can't even go one day
 without some sort of screw-up.

      I need a break, man.

 What's that supposed to mean?

  Just for a while, I need to
 put a little space between us.

             Yeah?

    If I'd have left you out
    there throwing baseballs

       breaking windows,
        you wouldn't be

half the athlete you are today.

 Just for a little while, Sam.

      I just need a little
   space to myself, damn it.

         Oh. I get it.

    Now that you've got that
   new slut of a girlfriend,

   you don't need me anymore,
          is that it?

         What the fuck
       did you say to me?

         You heard me.

 What the fuck is your problem?

             Do it.

             Fuck.

   I am not sure about this.

      Geez Thomas, you are
      such a little bitch.

     Look, I'm getting it.

   If you wanna party, do it.

    If you don't, fuck off.

          (door slams)

       -Sam: Hey, Thomas.
             -What?

            Nothin'.

           (knocking)

      "My only love sprung
       from my only hate.

    Too early seen unknown.

      And known too late."

         What's wrong?

       Nothing, I'm just
    thinking about the game,

            and Sam.

     It's going to be okay.

      It's not like it was
      a real loss, right?

             Right.

 Y'all will get 'em next time.

           (laughing)

       Look what I found.

        Spence: You are
     a dead son of a bitch!

             Fuck!

     Get that away from me.

           You know.

       That's the problem
        with you Thomas.

     You're a little pussy,
 you're scared to take chances,

         you're scared
     to live a little bit.

      That's why you don't
       have any friends.

  That's why you'll always be

        a fucking loser.

       What are we doing?

            Get out.

 Just chill out, I was kidding.

   Get outta the truck, Sam!

            Get out!

        You wanna fight?

     You think you can just
     bully me all my life?

  I am not your fucking bitch!

              God!

        (dialing phone)

         (ringing tone)

      (telephone ringing)

             Hello?

  Nolan:<i> Hey, what's up, man?</i>

    <i> Anything jumping off?</i>
    <i> What you getting into?</i>

        What are you so
        amped up about?

            Nothing.

Do I sound amped? That's weird.

        Hey, have you--
    have you talked to Sam?

             Yeah.

    <i> I saw him earlier.</i>

        But I dumped him
       about an hour ago.

       What do you mean?

    Tommy:<i> Look man, I can't</i>
    <i> get into it right now.</i>

       Ears in the room.

    Parents have this
     church thing to go to,

   <i> so I'm watching the brat.</i>

     Look, man, I gotta go,
           all right?

    I'll talk to you later.

             (beep)

 Â¶ (muffled rock music plays) Â¶

 Turn down that fucking music!

          -(knocking)
             -Shit.

   Great, you're who wrecked
        our fucking car!

   He's in his room, playing
     that damn video game.

    Ah, you got the game on.

           Who's up?

           -Dodgers.
             -Yeah?

         Cardinals are
       playing like shit.

        How's your mom?

          She's good.

  -Just working a ton though.
             -Yeah.

 I see she's letting you drive
   again after the accident.

    You know you didn't have
   to do that for him, Nolan.

     You know, I think he's
    up there waiting for ya,

 why don't you go check on him?

            (sighs)

            Thanks.

        Oh, my God, Sam.

     Today was incredible.

  Shakespeare himself couldn't
    have written it better.

     There's something just
     so amazing about her,

           the way--
     the way she smells...

         And her eyes!

She's just so badass, man!

              Sam.

 Are you even listening to me?

         Okay, come on.

           (sighing)

      Look, I know we both
     said some things today

      that we didn't mean.

         And the way I
      reacted was stupid.

      But you know, Coach,

   he was on my ass and I...

      Sam? Man, I'm sorry.

              Sam.

              Sam?

          Oh, my God.

        Oh, my God, Sam?

              Sam.

      Sam, buddy, come on.

      Stop fooling around
         man, come on.

             -Sam?
       -(heart pounding)

              Sam?

        Bill come here!

              Sam!

    Dr. Lane:<i> Nolan. Nolan.</i>

 So what I'm trying to identify

      is if you think that
       this use of drugs,

        this addiction,

      is a result of your
      best friend's death?

     Or would you say that
    you could trace it back

 to other events in your past?

      What do you plan on
    doing with that, Sharon?

         Leave, Daniel.

        I am just asking
      you to please leave.

    I don't wanna hurt you.

 What are you gonna do, Sharon?

     What are you gonna do?

       What are you gonna
      do with it, Sharon?

        Daniel, please!

           (sobbing)

             Fine.

    That's all right.

          Hey, Sharon.

  You wanna see my curve ball?

       (glass shattering)

         I am so sorry.

I know you were his best friend.

      But you gotta know,

   nothing you could've done

would've prevented this, Nolan.

         (Dad snivels)

   It was outta your control.

      No, I turned my back
       on my best friend.

       That's the kind of
      friend I was to him,

he needed me and I wasn't there.

         Nolan you need
      to hear me on this,

     Sam made his decision.

  If anybody failed in seeing
    what was going on here,

 and doing something about it,

           it was me.

       I was charged with
        protecting him.

         And I didn't.

     I'm sorry, I gotta go.

            Thomas.

 -Let's go, take me over there.
             -What?

     He's the reason Sam is
      dead, you know that.

       Nolan, Sam is the
    reason that Sam is dead.

   Besides, I don't wanna be
    around that guy anymore.

       He literally makes
         my skin crawl.

             -Fine.
            -Nolan!

         Come on, man.

That guy is a maggot, you don't
   know what he's capable of.

             Nolan.

             Nolan.

            -Nolan.
       -Rachel, not now.

            -Nolan!
   -Rachel, I don't... What?

  I've been trying to call you
  for the past couple of days

  and I just... I'm not trying
    to nag you or anything,

      but I just want you
        to know that you

don't have to be alone in this.

     I know, Rachel, look,
     I just need some time
        to myself, okay?

           To think.

   Well, I can come with you.

 -Or you can come to my house.
            -Rachel.

        It's whatever--
      I don't really care.

            Rachel!

    Look, I can't right now.

       I gotta take care
      of some stuff, okay?

      I'll call you later.

      How was the funeral?

      You know, I know...

 That it seems like everything
  is spinning out of control,

    but you gotta know that
    God has a greater plan.

     What kind of God plans
    the death of a teenager?

       We were all given
     the gift of free will.

God did not choose that for Sam.

        Mom, Sam didn't
     choose to die either.

     He was just trying to
    make himself feel better

   after I let him down, Mom.

 Okay, this was not your fault.

        And I won't let
       you blame yourself

     for something that you
    had nothing to do with.

     Mom, it had everything
         to do with me.

    If I hadn't told Sam...

             What?

        I need the car.

   Why, where are you going?

    Mom, I just need to take
    a drive. I need the car.

          I cannot let
      what happened to Sam

         happen to you.

  Rachel wanted me to come by.
     I'm gonna go see her.

      I know you're having
  a hard time accepting this.

 But you're gonna have to learn
   to accept that he's gone.

    And there is nothing you
   can do to bring him back.

          I love you.

And if anything happened to you,

     I would lose my mind.

Do you want me to lose my mind?

              No.

         What the fuck?

Boy, what the fuck is you doin'?

    You fucking killed Sam.

   Get the fuck away from me!

         What the fuck
     is you talkin' about?

    Get outta my crib, man.

           (grunting)

       Oh shit, oh shit,
       come on man, stop!

         (Spence yells)

         Come on, man!

    -This is all your fault!
          -What, man?

  Sam jacked me for my stash,
    I didn't give it to him.

   Besides, I thought he was
   trying to make some bread.

   I didn't know he was gonna
   go all Heath Ledger on me.

  Liar, you're a goddamn liar!

     You're a fucking liar.
    Don't fucking lie to me!

           (groaning)

           Fuck that!

     That's what you want?

    Boy, you don't know who
 the fuck you're dealing with.

   I would've never hurt Sam.
  He's like my little brother.

   And I was looking out for
 him before you even knew him!

   Back when he was too small
    to look out for himself!

I knew Sam better than anybody.
       He was my brother!

    You don't know what the
   fuck you're talking about.

     -I should be with him!
             -What?

            Come on!

       He needs me there!

      The fuck? You crazy!

             Fuck!

          Get up, kid.

         Come on, man.

        Don't be laying
      out here all night.

         What the fuck.

           Look, man.

You need to get your ass up.

  Either get back in that car,

       and drive the hell
        away from here,

      or come inside, man.

     Because you're drawing
    attention I don't need!

             Fuck.

     Come on man, come on.

        Now toughen up!

  It's always been me and Sam.

What the fuck am I gonna do now?

           Look, man.

     If you're waiting for
      me to say something

     all profound and shit,
  it ain't gonna happen, man.

    I ain't built like that.

   If you wanna feel better,

I can help you there, man.

  But it's up to you, brother.

             Fuck.

      (inaudible chatter)

     You see, the classics
     are very much like...

       A romantic novel.

             Nolan.

          (slams book)

           (laughter)

        Am I boring you?

            No, Sir.

    If I catch you sleeping
       in my class again,

    I'm gonna write you up.

          (bell rings)

             Nolan.

   I noticed you haven't been
    as focused as of lately.

    Is everything all right?

    Yeah, everything's cool,

      I've just got a lot
     going on with practice

   and helping my mom around
      the house, you know?

      I understand you're
      dealing with a lot.

     I know you're having a
  hard time with Sam's death.

           I get it.

        If you ever need
      someone to talk to,

     my door's always open
       to you, all right?

 Thank you, I appreciate that.

          Absolutely.

         Oh, and Nolan?

   I meant what I said about
    sleeping in my class.

           Yes, Sir.

       See you tomorrow.

      Teacher: All right.

              Hey.

            Rachel.

    I called you yesterday.
         What happened?

      I was busy studying.

  Yeah, well I thought we were
  supposed to study together.

      We were supposed to
   study together on Tuesday,

     but today's Thursday,
     so that would mean...

   I know, I know, I'm sorry.

       I've been so busy
     lately, I lost track.

        Busy doing what?

You know you're not the only one

        that's ever lost
        a friend before.

       Mourning is not an
       individual sport.

 Look Rachel, I don't need you
  ragging on me too right now.

         -Stop, Nolan.
             -What?

     You don't get to walk
    away from me right now.

Why do you keep pushing me away?

            I mean,
   what's going on with you?

    What's going on with us?

       Nothing, I just--
    I have a lot on my mind.

    Well, you look horrible.

     Like you haven't slept
      or showered in days.

    And I saw what you made
     on the exam last week.

    And now Coach is pulling
      you from the lineup?

 So that's what this is about?

        You liked being
      able to say that you

        go out with the
       star athlete, huh?

            Stop it.

     If you don't wanna be
   with me, then that's fine,

     but it's obvious that
    you need help right now.

        And you know no
     matter what's going on

    between the two of us, I
 don't wanna see you like this.

      You don't know what
     you're talking about!

       In fact, you don't
       know what I need,

     or anything about me.

      The only person who
       knows those things

      is Sam and you don't
      look like Sam to me.

        No, I'm looking
       at him right now.

      Don't you ever talk
      about Sam that way.

        -Do you hear me?
             -Stop!

      You don't know him!

   You're gonna get yourself
      kicked off the team.

     You shut the fuck up!

   I don't need either of you

     telling me what to do,
           all right?

     -Just leave me alone!
        -Boy: Chill out.

        Dude, fuck off!

     Â¶ (rock music plays) Â¶

            (knocks)

          Yo, Spence.

      Hey, what's up, man?

      Good afternoon, sir.

    Welcome to Spence Mart.

  Man, get yo ass inside, man.

  What do you wanna start at?

      All right, tell me,
   what's the deal with this?

     That's the Maui Waui.

           (laughing)

            (coughs)

      Nolan: I don't know
     if I'm feelin' it yet.

   I can see it in your damn
    face you're feelin' it.

         I can't tell.

  If you can't tell, you high.

     You trying them rings?

         Get the peace.

        The white lady.

        Here, a little,
      right on your hand.

       Come on, come on.

       How do you do it?
        Just like this?

       Right, real quick.

             Shit.

           (snorting)

        (Spence laughs)

        (Spence laughs)

             Yeah.

 Bring you right back up, man.

           -Oh, man.
             -Yeah.

           (sighing)

            Spence.

        I wanna do this.

    Hey, put that down, man.

 That's for the big boys, man.

 You are not allowed, come on.

        Big boys?

   Spence, I'm not even that
     much younger than you.

      Hey, listen, why do
     you care, if I buy it?

-You hear what the fuck I said?
          -It's fine.

         I said that's
       not for you, okay?

     I don't ever wanna see
 you touching that shit. Ever.

        <i> Comprendes?</i>

Sorry man, I just thought that--

         Hey, I don't--
   I don't need you to think.

I just need you to do as I say.

      God damn, you ruined
     my fuckin' high, man!

             Shit.

  Ain't it time for you to be
getting home or something, man?

         Come on, man.

     Giving me more trouble
       than you're worth.

           (sighing)

        You still here?

           (knocking)

              Hey.

          What are you
       doing here, Nolan?

    Nolan: (sighs) I...

          Just leave.

          -Leave now.
      -Rachel, I'm sorry.

    Yeah, and you should be.

   I'm a real person, Nolan.

    You can't just treat me
   like one of your friends.

 I thought you were different.

            I know.

    And that's why I'm here.
  I'm here to apologize, okay?

    Look, it took me an hour
   to find the perfect card.

  Then it should take you less
 time to get back to your car.

              Dad!

       Give us a minute,
        baby doll, okay?

      Sir, look, I just--

      No, we need to talk.

 You ever smoke a Cuban cigar?

            No, Sir.

    That's not what I heard.

Matter of fact, I heard that you
        and your friends

      will smoke anything
       that'll light up.

         Is that true?

    Sir, I think that lately
  I've been given the wrong--

      The wrong what, boy?

       The wrong address?

Cause the family that lives here

  is an educated family, they
   are a hard-working family,

they are a family that believes

       that you shouldn't
     put shit up your nose.

     They're a family that
     sees through bullshit.

      Sir, I don't know--

       Don't speak, just
    stand there in silence.

  That's my daughter in there.

         You get that?

          My daughter,

       she belongs to me,

 and she belongs to her mother.

       Not to some little
       punk with an arm.

  You know if it was up to me,

 there wouldn't be a next time.

  But if there is a next time,

        if you decide to
       open up your mouth

  and disrespect my daughter,

   I will come to your house
   in the middle of the night

      and I will drag you
     and your drug buddies

      out into the middle
         of the street

  and I will beat your asses.

     -Do you understand me?
             -Yes.

         Don't answer,
      just nod your head.

      God gave you a gift.

      He gave you a gift.

  And you can choose to either

      smoke those batters,

    or you can smoke crack.

      The choice is yours.

       You're headed down
      an empty road, son.

        It's a dead end.

And I'll be damned if I let you,

    I repeat, if I let you,

   take my daughter with you.

 I'm gonna give you 30 seconds
    to get off my property.

              27.

              23.

         (door creaks)

             Dehra:
   <i> Hey, lady. You doing okay?</i>

 You don't look like yourself.

     It's nothin', just...

      Dealing with a lot.

          Is it Nolan?

        Why do you ask?

        Just heard that
      he hadn't been doing

 so well since his friend died.

    If you need anything, or
  need to talk about anything,

       I'm here for you.

  What are you tryin' to say?

        I'm saying that
       maybe you've done

   all that you can do under
   the circumstances, Sharon.

       Maybe it's time to
    bring in a professional.

   Well, if you're suggesting
   that he needs counselling,

   you can stop right there.

 I don't know where you've been
    getting your ideas from,

      but I am his mother,

   and I am very confident...

   Listen, I'm not trying to
tell you how to raise your son,

     by any means, come on.

        I'm just saying
       that sometimes...

            Sharon?

            Sharon?

   Sometimes the people that
     are the closest to us,

      are the least likely
      to see the situation

     for what it really is.

     You have no idea what
    I've been dealing with.

   And I would appreciate it

     if you would just deal
       with your own kids

 and stop listening to gossip,

    because my son is fine.

       So just back off.

        Sharon, I didn't
      mean to offend you.

    (footsteps approaching)

            (knocks)

             Nolan?

            <i> Nolan.</i>

     <i> What are you doing?</i>

    <i> Open this door, Nolan.</i>

     Open the door, Nolan.

     I need to talk to you.

       Mom, I'm not doing
    anything, just go away.

           I'm fine.

     I can't do that, baby.

 Can you open the door, please?

    <i> Let me in, sweetheart.</i>

    Let me help you, honey.

        Okay, let me in!

        Let me help you!

      Nolan:<i> Mom, I don't</i>
<i> need your help anymore,</i>

   <i> I'm not a kid, all right?</i>
     <i> Just leave me alone!</i>

           (bubbling)

            (coughs)

    <i> I'm not a kid anymore.</i>

  If you don't open this door,

  I am gonna call the police!

       Sounds great, Mom,
     call the fucking cops.

        (heart beating)

     Open the door, Nolan.

    Can you let me help you?

    Sharon:<i> Mommy knows that</i>
     <i> you're hurting baby.</i>

       I feel great, Mom.

            (pants)

      As a matter of fact,

      I'm gonna go flying.

  What are you talking about?

      I'm gonna go flying!

             Fuck.

             Nolan!

        Open this door!

           Dr. Lane:
     So would you say that
 your falling out of the window

     or thinking you could
     fly out of the window,

      would you say that's
       an isolated event?

        Or would you say
        that it could be

        a part of other
      events in your past?

        I don't have an
        addiction, okay?

 I'm not addicted to anything.

  I can stop whenever I want,
     I just got a bad load.

      You got a bad load?

             Yeah.

    Well, Nolan, I have been
    doing this for 18 years,

     and I have to tell you
  that 99 percent of the time,

        that's not true.

         Honestly, Mom,

 this isn't gonna happen again,

      I promise you, okay?

       I've been dealing
     with a lot right now.

      You both know that.

   I'm better now, I just...

           I'm sorry.

        My son has never
      been in any trouble.

     I just think that he--
  he's going through a phase.

  Well, you know what I think?

      I think that you are
    aiding in his addiction

 by rationalizing his behavior.

           And Nolan,

    I think you're in denial
     about your addiction.

             Yeah.

    That's what it is.

      Yeah, you're wrong.

       This is bullshit.

       Excuse me, Nolan,
    we're here to help you.

     That's why we're here.

              We--

       Sharon, I know you
     think that all of your

protection and love can overcome

   all of Nolan's challenges,

     but I am here to tell
     you that his addiction

   is beyond your influence.

   I know that you have more
    knowledge in this area.

       But I know my son.

   And he's not just my son,

 he is my best friend and if--

       if we have made it
       this far together,

         we can make it
     through this together.

             Fine.

       You choose not to
       continue therapy,

       I can't force you.

  But I want you to know that
    it is against my advice.

      I'm not saying that

 we won't continue with therapy

     but my biggest concern
       is getting my son

    back home and in school.

      That's your choice.

     But I am asking you to
  please get him in a program.

 Because that is the way he'll
    be able to move forward,

         he'll be able

  to have this successful life
       you want for him.

       I just don't want
     to push him too hard.

     Nolan is not as tough
    as he comes across.

     Well, this is my first
    time assessing your son,

     but please believe me,

    he is much tougher than
    you give him credit for.

           Thank you.

    And I will be in touch.

   And he is not equipped to
 make this decision by himself.

         He is a minor.

  Well, how long is the wait?

        So you're saying
      that there are only

       two beds available
        and that my son

 would have to apply for a bed?

      Okay, well how long
        does that take?

          Three weeks.

  Well, my son needs help now.

     Today, not in 21 days.

       Your pamphlet says
      you can help today!

          You know...

          I'm a nurse,

 I know that my son is not the
 only kid with a drug problem,

    I'm not an idiot, but if
  you can't get him help now,

then that is false advertising!

          This is it.

          This is it.

 I want you to go out there and
 do exactly what we practiced.

  That's it, no more, no less.

    Blood, sweat, tears.

  And leave nothing to chance.

        Yeah? You ready?

          Team: Ready.

             -Yeah?
          -Team: Yeah.

     Let's get on the bus.

           Let's go.

          Hey, Coach.

What are you doing here, Nolan?

       I'm here to play.

        You're in no
       condition to play,

 you know that as well as I do.

       Coach just give me
    the chance to show you

    what I can do, you won't
   regret it, I promise you.

  Son, I warned you about the
 consequences of your actions.

       I am here for you,
       but off the field.

        I can't let what
      you're going through

      affect the others by
    having you on the team.

 So you're just writing me off?

      Yeah, you know what?

      I don't need you or
      this bullshit team!

             Nolan.

             Nolan!

         And Mom, just
     rest, lots of fluids,

and two of these every 12 hours.

      And he will be back
     to himself in no time.

          -Thank you.
        -You're welcome.

        See ya, buddy.

          Hey, Sharon,

       I'm so sorry about
     our last conversation.

    I was completely out...

      It's getting worse.

              How?

        He doesn't come
        out of his room.

         I took all the
      locks off the doors.

    I check my bank account,

        $400 is missing.

             No...

And I cannot get him into rehab,

  there are no beds available.

    What about Doctor Lane?

      Oh, my god, if I...

       If I even bring up
    her name, he flips out.

     Okay, okay, come here.

You sound like you're giving up

and there's something we can do.

            (knocks)

        Nolan: Hey, man.

         Boy, what the
      hell you doin' here?

    Look man, I need some...

           (sniffing)

        Woman:<i> Spencer?</i>

        Hey, who's that?

       That's my mother.

        -You got a mom?
             -What?

        Hey, look, man,
       I'm just messing.

      Dude, what the fuck?

      Speaking of mothers,
shouldn't you be with yours?

        What you worried
       about my mom for?

        Because all good
     little boys need to be

        spending quality
      time with they Moms.

  Matter of fact, you need to
  get yo ass up off my porch,

     and back to your mama.

        Hey, look, man.

     You gotta hook me up,
   you know I'm good for it.

     Hook you up? Man, get
    the fuck up outta here.

       Hey, listen, look.

     I got a gold bracelet
  and a 36-inch TV in my car.

    What can that do for me?

         Come on, man.

    All right man, go
      get that shit, man.

       And when you come
     back, wait right here,

      don't knock on this
      fuckin' door again.

   Got ya, got ya, thank you.

              Hi.

           (sighing)

        You sure you're
       ready to do this?

    I have no choice.

     If I don't do it now,
      I'm gonna lose him.

  I cannot lose my only child.

            I know.

   Okay, well we're all set.

  See you at the house, okay?

             Okay.

        Dehra: Bye bye!

  Where are you gonna put them

       when you take them
        outta your bag?

      Doctor Morris needs
   them on the second floor.

           Methadone?

     In your personal bag?

        I told you he's
    tougher than you think,

        and this is much
      bigger than you are.

      What the hell do you
 plan on doing with these? No!

       What would you do?

     To keep your child on
    this planet another day?

        There are better
         ways to ensure

    that he's gonna be okay.

  Would you just listen to me?

    If you get caught taking
  that outside this hospital,

you know you'll get put in jail.

    It's a federal offense,
        you're a nurse,

         you know that.

      Thank you Cassandra,
      for your assistance.

I'm taking it into my own hands.

            Sharon.

       I understand your
       frustration, I do.

 And you know I'm here for you.

 If we do the right things now,

      Nolan will be fine.

     Thank you. Thank you.

    Please don't do this.

             Don't!

           Thank you.

     You're putting me in a
   really bad position here.

           Sharon...

         What the hell?

            (sighs)

        -Rachel:<i> Hello?</i>
            -Rachel.

        I wanna see you.

              No.

      I don't think that's
    such a good idea, Nolan.

     Rachel:<i> I have to go.</i>

     Rachel, wait, Rachel!

          (door slams)

  Help me with the groceries?

    No, the ones in the car.

       Hey, how ya doin?

   Just a couple more things.

            Sure.

           (grunting)

       (Sharon shushing)

    Sharon: I'm trying to...

              Hey.

   If you're gonna do it, you
might as well do it right.

        30 day supply of
  buprenorphine and syringes.

     You really think it's
     gonna take that long?

     I don't know, Sharon.

     I'm far from being an
     addiction specialist.

    What I do know though,

  is that in order to give him

  a chance to really recover,

  you gotta keep him isolated.

     At least until you get
      him into a program.

           All right.

        What's going on?

         (Nolan yawns)

              Mom?

     Mom, what's going on?

        I'm helping you.

              Mom?

             What?

       You're helping me?

            (snorts)
   Mom, get these off of me!

           (groaning)

     Did you do this to me?

              Mom?

 Ok, I know that you're upset.

      But this is the only
      option that I have.

      I can't stand by and
     let you kill yourself.

          Mom, you...

          Oh, my God.

    Mom, you don't know what
     you're talking about.

   Mom, take these off, now!

         No, we will...

    Get through it together.

 I won't let you do this alone.

        I'll be with you
     every step of the way

         and we'll get
      through it together.

  No, you let me go now, Mom.

    You can't do this, Mom.

     This has to be against
     the law or something.

             Fuck!

       Mom you don't have
     the right to do this.

           Yes, I do!

        I'm your mother.

    And I would do anything
        to protect you.

      Even if it kills me.

 I have to get you well, Nolan.

              Mom?

             Nolan!

    Nolan, stop it, you're
      gonna hurt yourself!

 Mom, you've got me chained up,

       what do you expect
       from me. It hurts!

           (groaning)

    Mom that hurts. Why do
   you keep doing this to me?

    It's to calm you so that
    you don't hurt yourself.

   You can't go cold turkey.

   Mom, I just wanna go home.

       Please, stop this.

       Listen, I promise
      it'll be different.

      I'll stop, I swear.

         I can't, baby.

      Not until the poison
     is outta your system.

         We should eat.

   Look, I have soup for you.

    Mom, I don't want soup.
        I wanna go home!

           Get away.

     You're not going home.

           (sniffles)

   You're not going anywhere
    until you're clean.

 You have a problem and this is

         the only way I
      know how to fix it.

        To keep me
    handcuffed to the wall?

     You gave me no choice!

      You think I want to
      treat you like this?

      Can you loosen these
      handcuffs at least?

   They're killing my wrists.

            Please?

              Ow.

         Sharon: Sorry.

         You gotta eat.

       If you don't eat,
     you can't get better,

    if you don't get better,
       you can't go home.

             Here.

   At least have some water.

    You need to drink this.

            Come on.

          I hate you.

         If you need to
      go to the bathroom,

    I have a bedpan for you.

          I love you.

   Tommy: Hey, Mrs. Adamson?

         Hello, Thomas.

   Hey, I was just wondering
       if I could stop by

         and see Nolan.
      Or is it a bad time?

   I am just on the way out.

       Oh, I, we just...

       I haven't seen him
       around in a while.

        Well, he's doing
        much better now.

  He went to spend a few weeks

   with my parents in Kansas.

 Wanted a break from everything

and we just thought it was best
  that we didn't tell anyone.

             Okay.

The next time that you see him,

      can you please tell
       him that the team

 -misses him and we said hello?
         -Sharon: Yes.

  We hope he gets better soon.

   Thank you, Thomas. I will.

            (groans)

       (distorted voice)
    I been watchin' you boy.

      You learned to throw
          a curve ball

       just like your Pa.

           (tapping)

       (distorted voice)
       You got scouts...

   Coming out to your games?

       I bet you think...

you're gonna get a scholarship.

 And then it's off to the pros!

           (laughing)

 (distorted voice) Well, I got
    some news for you, son.

  You ain't no better than me.

        (glass breaking)

(distorted voice) You're a chip
     off the ol' dung heap!

        That's my blood
  flowing through your veins,

     which means you ain't
      never gonna be shit!

            (crying)

       (distorted voice)
    Just like your pa.

      What are you doing?

       Stay away from me.

       (distorted voice)
          So let's see

         what you got.

         No, get away!

         (yells) Nolan!

         (yells) Nolan!

         (yells) Nolan!

           (groaning)

       -You're not real.
        -Sharon:<i> Nolan!</i>

        <i> Where are you?</i>

       Nolan, answer me!

           (groaning)

       Daniel: She tried
     to ruin it for me too.

      I'm nothin like you!

    Just stay away! Go away!

            (crying)

        You can't escape
        your fate, boy.

   It's just a matter of time
 till you end up just like me.

            (crying)

           (shushing)

           It's okay.

      (cell phone ringing)

      Hey, how's it going?

        I thought he was
        locked up tight.

  He could've died out there.

 I don't know if I can do this.

      <i> It's a lot harder</i>
       <i> than I thought.</i>

         Okay, Sharon,

    when I told you all you
     had to do was call me,

          I meant it.

            I know.

   I am just so used to doing
     everything on my own.

      <i> You ask people for</i>
   <i> help and they feel like</i>

       they can criticize
       you or judge you.

     Trust me, I have made
    plenty of mistakes,

  I have no room to judge you.

     <i> Sharon, let me help.</i>

        Could you bring
        me some bandages

         and supplies?

      I don't think I can
     leave him alone again.

       Okay. No problem.

    If I leave now, I can be
with you within the hour. Okay?

     <i> -I'll see you soon.</i>
             -Okay.

           Thank you.

         I need a shot.

         It's not time
       for another shot.

       You haven't given
      me one in two days,

  I need another one now, Mom.

        Come on, please.

           Tomorrow.

          (screaming)

              -No!
        -Give it to me!

          (screaming)

  This is not the way a mother
 is supposed to treat her son!

          Look at me!

       Can't you see what
      you're doing to me?

    I am trying to save you.

       You're killing me.

  Sharon: I am protecting you.

              No.

 You're trying to ruin my life.

    Just like you did Dad's!

        Yeah, you're the
       reason he's dead!

       That is not true.

        Do not say that.

 Yeah! That's what's happening.

      You are all I have.

     Everything I have ever
     done has been for you.

     I have done everything
    I can do to protect you!

        No, you didn't.

         You were only
      protecting yourself!

   Why didn't we just leave?

       You were just too
    young to understand--

     You're a lying bitch!

           (groaning)

        God, I'm sorry!

     Just get away from me!

      Just leave me alone!

           Mom! Mom!

     Give me the gun, boy.

      You're too little to
      have such a big toy.

    I said give me the gun!

            (groans)

       (distorted voice)
  I said give me the gun, boy!

            (groans)

           (gunshots)

     Sharon: Baby, wake up!

        Wake up, Nolan!

        (screams) Nolan!

 Give me the key to the cuffs,
        give me the key.

        Please, wake up.
         Wake up, baby!

  Sharon: He's not breathing!

  I gave him the wrong things!

       Let me get at him.

            My baby!

           (sobbing)

         (screams) No!

            Wake up!

      Sam: Come on, Nolan.

   Trust me. She'll be okay.

    Nolan: I've missed you.

               Â¶
