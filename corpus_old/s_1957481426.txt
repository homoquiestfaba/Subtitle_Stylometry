[christmas music playing]

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:06.572
â™ª it's beginning to look
a lot like christmas â™ª

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:10.609
â™ª everywhere you go

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:13.145
â™ª take a look
at the 5 and 10 â™ª

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.447
â™ª glistening once again

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:19.485
â™ª to candy canes
and silver lanes aglow â™ª

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.188
â™ª it's beginning to look
a lot like christmas â™ª

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:25.190
hi! Merry christmas!

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.127
Hi! Good to see you!

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:29.695
â™ª the prettiest
sight to see â™ª

00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:31.363
â™ª is the holly
that will be â™ª

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:34.767
â™ª on your own front door

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:36.635
hi! Good morning!

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.137
Hi. Merry christmas!

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:39.805
I thought you were
going to the city.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.207
Oh, I am. I just
had to swing by and grab some...

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.108
Red velvet cupcakes.

00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:45.010
Uh huh.

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:46.111
Your sister and simon's
favorite.

00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:48.147
-Best in utah.
-You betcha.

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:48.814
-Thank you, daddy.
[doorbell chimes]

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.816
-you bet.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:51.650
I have a couple more
christmas errands to run

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.519
and I'm off.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:58.323
Okay. Here you go, valerie.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.359
Peppermint hot cocoa.
Exactly 4 marshmallows.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.227
You remember everyone's order.

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:04.129
But I ask you this,

00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:05.564
what if I suddenly wanted
2 marshmallows?

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.132
Oh, I would advise
against that.

00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:09.668
No, 4, is the perfect number.
I should know.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.303
I've been managing this place
since I was 16.

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:13.872
Since she was 6,
if we're being honest.

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:16.008
Are you still going
to France this year?

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:17.843
Oh, I'm sorry, was that a...

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.711
No, no, no. That's okay.
Yes. I am going to France.

00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:21.146
And never coming back.

00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:23.549
Oh, daddy, stop it!

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.485
I...It'll be a little bit
different this year.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.253
I mean, uncle dave and I
used to go every year

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:30.155
for the last decade,

00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:32.024
so, it feels like a tradition
at this point,

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:34.593
but I'm still working out
the details.

00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:36.695
Well, here's to nothing
being the same without him.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.831
Here's to that.

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:39.898
-Have a good day.
-You too.

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:41.900
-Thank you. -Bye bye.

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:42.768
[doorbell chimes]

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.573
I know mom's being brave.

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.608
How's she doing really?

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:51.043
We have had many
conversations

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:52.578
about your uncle's theater.

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.179
She's still thinking
of selling it?

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:57.015
We have talked it through
so many times.

00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:58.717
She thinks it's for the best.

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.920
Well, then, swift family rules.

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:02.588
We're all here to support her.

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:03.355
Yeah.

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:26.411

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.568
young jen:
Watch. Jin...Gle bells.

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:52.638
Jin...Gle bells!

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:55.407
1, 2, 3.

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:59.945
1...2...3.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.747
And then we have
a flourish here!

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:03.682
Jen: Meg, focus.

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:06.151
We've already practiced it
this way.

00:03:06.187 --> 00:03:09.321
Right, jen. But it needs an
extra something.

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:10.255
And if you keep changing it,
we'll never be ready.

00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:28.140
You really know how to push
your sister's buttons,

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:29.808
don't you?

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:33.378
I think our dance number
needs something.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.847
Is it jet packs?
Christmas in space?

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:37.649
[meg giggles]

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:39.051
we'll put fishbowls
on your heads,

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.385
and rig you up
and fly you around.

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:42.988
[makes whooshing sound]

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:46.558
give it the old uncle dave
joie de vivre!

00:03:46.627 --> 00:03:48.994
Ooh! I sound like
maurice chevalier.

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.663
Joie de vivre.
Joie de vivre.

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.665
I'm gonna keep working on it.

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:56.335
I know I have a good idea
but

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.403
it takes me a minute
to figure it out.

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:00.005
When I opened this theater,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.540
do you know
what I was gonna call it?

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.709
The hazelwood show palace.

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:06.812
I know, yikes, right?

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.013
And your mom said
to name it something

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:09.214
that had a little more meaning.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.515
So you called it the madison?

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:13.485
After grandpa madison.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.687
The point is,
your mom was right.

00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:16.655
And I rely on her
for things like that.

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:55.560
[doorbell chimes]

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:00.365
thanks. Oh, so sorry.
Go ahead.

00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:02.634
I'm...Wide load. (chuckles)

00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:05.470
can I just put this
right here? Thanks. Ah.

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.940
Oh, this is cute. Ooh!

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:09.975
-Oh! Oh, oh!
-Oh, my gosh.

00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:11.143
Whoa!

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:13.045
Oh, wow.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.880
I just saved you some real

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:19.084
embarrassment, and like uh,
$50.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.286
I kind of think I'd have
managed to save it myself.

00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:22.554
I'm known for my cat-like
reflexes.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.589
Hmm. Is that right?

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.092
I stand by the value
of my assist.

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.160
What's in the case?

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:30.562
Snacks.

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:32.798
-It's a tuba.
-Oh.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:35.934
It's the basis of the brass.
Strength of any good song.

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.337
You play tuba? Professionally?

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:39.838
Oh, no, no.
Not professionally.

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:41.773
-No.
-Ah.

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.443
I played in high school. I
do really enjoy it though.

00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:46.178
But every year...
[cell phone rings]

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:47.779
...I come here and meet
my nephew and my sister

00:05:47.815 --> 00:05:49.614
at the christmas brass
concert, so this year...

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.184
I'm sorry. I gotta take this.
Hello. Sorry.

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:54.119
No. Good.

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:55.420
Ah, yeah. No wait.
When did that happen?

00:05:58.025 --> 00:05:59.191
Right. No. I'll be right there.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:00.992
Yeah. I'll come right now.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.427
[doorbell chimes]
-cool.

00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:03.295
Yeah, no. It was nice
to meet you.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.964
Nice to...That was good.

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.632
I'm actually
gonna get some hats.

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:08.633
[brass band plays
christmas music]

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:31.289
[simon inaudible]

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:35.527
oh! [inaudible]
there she is.

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.062

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:43.969
I was the best tuba player in
the hazelwood marching band.

00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:46.371
I dug this out of the attic,
and I just thought...

00:06:46.407 --> 00:06:48.140
How hard can it be?

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:49.908
How hard can it be?
Very hard. It turns out.

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:51.576
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:54.012
But the looks on your faces,
oh! So worth it.

00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:56.348
Okay. I got us

00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:57.649
some fun christmas hats.

00:06:57.684 --> 00:06:59.918

00:06:59.987 --> 00:07:02.487
These are something!
Here.

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:04.689
Uh, no. You two are enough.

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:06.491
Put it on.
Rules of the season.

00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:07.392
Someone gives you
a fun christmas hat,

00:07:07.428 --> 00:07:08.493
you gotta put it on your head.

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:10.429
Did they re-write the rules?

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:11.663
Because I swear last time I read
it, there was nothing in there.

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:12.898
-Come on.
-Put it on.

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:16.568
Both: Oh! You're so cute.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.036
Look at our guy!

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.207

Jen: It'll be cute.

Oh, my gosh!

Okay. [inaudible] we changed
decorations--

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:28.380
okay.

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:30.348
...This year, but I really need

00:07:30.384 --> 00:07:31.917
your honest, first
impressions, okay? Promise?

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:32.918
Yes. I'm scared.

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:38.056
Oh. It's beautiful!

00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:39.558
You like it?

00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:41.626
It's simple. Spare.

00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:43.462
Well, I wasn't going
for spare

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.031
necessarily, as much as
a modern, classy,

00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:48.900
understated.

00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:50.569
-It's incredible.
-Yeah?

00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:52.037
Yeah, this is what dad
always talks about.

Build a community

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:55.574
both: And the people
will gather! Yes! ?

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:57.909
-Look.
-Is that for me?

00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.578
Got it for mom for christmas.
Come on.

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:00.779
-Ooh.
-We have some work to do here.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.214
What?

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:03.715
Let's wrap them up.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.786
Oh! Oh, simon.

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.088
You may not remember,

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:12.123
but uncle dave used to put
out these little figurines

00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:13.291
for each of the children
at christmas.

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:14.826
Except that two of them

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:16.828
are missing,
so the actual presents--

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:17.596
-oh, no!
-...Are the new additions.

00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:19.831
Okay.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.266
-So, we have some shopping to
do.
-Yeah.

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:23.068

Always a pleasure.

And you, sir?

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.141
Joe: Okay, be honest about
the hors d'oeuvres.

00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:31.977
Oh, joe. I don't think
you've met my sister meg.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.345
Meg, this is joe.
Our new general manager.

00:08:33.413 --> 00:08:34.513
Well, new-ish.

00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:35.747
Uh, we have met.

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.482
He likes tubas,

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:39.150
but he's a little clumsy.

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:41.186
Oh. So you're
jennifer's sister, huh?

00:08:41.255 --> 00:08:42.687
Mm-hmm.

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.289
Cat-like reflexes here.

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:45.423
Tell me about those contests.

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:47.526
Great salt, it's a

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:49.928
local magazine, every year,
they pick 3 restaurants,

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:52.597
to do this whole competition.

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:54.499
They compete to throw
the best christmas party.

00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:55.867
-Yeah.
-I love it.
Who chooses the winner?

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:58.036
The magazine. Everybody
gets a ton of publicity,

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.772
and if you win, the magazine
will donate $25,000

00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:01.439
to the charity of your choice.

00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:03.308
Whoa.

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:04.876
And for us,
it's big mountain food bank.

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.611
I mean, it would mean
lines out the door.

00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:08.213
It takes us to a whole
next level.

00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:09.548
It'd be amazing.

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.149
-Wow.
-Yeah.

00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:13.785
I'm so excited.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.855
And this is delicious.
Is that chervil?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.723
You can taste the chervil.

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:20.292
Oh, uh, professional
herb taster.

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:21.226
Yeah, jen didn't tell you?

00:09:21.295 --> 00:09:23.995
Uh...

00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:27.732
Kidding. (laughs)
it's a joke. I was joking.

00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:35.006
Jen:

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.975
I know.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.243
I mean I love hazelwood
at christmas.

00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:39.411
-Yeah.
-But salt lake city.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:40.312
I know, it's amazing, right?

00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:42.681
It feels so good.

00:09:42.716 --> 00:09:43.481
Why don't you stick around
for a few more days?

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:45.317
You know I'm offering you

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:47.385
the world's most unreliable,
inflatable bed.

00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:48.720

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.890
Both: Every time!

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.092
So, are you still going
to France this year?

00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:56.528
Yeah. Without uncle dave.

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:59.331
Oh...You two loved
traveling together.

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:02.434
I loved hanging out with all
of his friends in paris.

00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:03.368
I loved that he spoke
terrible french.

00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:04.836

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:06.771
Yeah, he'd be like, mare-si.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.207
-[meg laughs]
-he was the best.

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:10.508
But, I just think I gotta go.

00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:12.577
Yeah.

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:15.113
I think I might need
to stay for awhile.

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:17.949
Be honest. You have a secret
french boyfriend, don't you?

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:21.286
How dare you bring up jean-louis
at a time like this.

00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:25.423
Have you ever felt like you
just needed the next thing?

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:27.125
-All the time.
-Really?

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:31.763
So what is the next thing?

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:32.764
Uncle dave used to say that
big decisions take time,

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.466
and I think for me, distance.

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:36.101
Hmm.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.769
Like today, I got in the car,

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.938
and I was driving here,
it just

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.306
felt like anything was possible.

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.208
Yeah.

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:44.409
I mean, whatever's next for me,

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:46.478
I don't think it's in hazelwood.

00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:47.912
Well, when you're ready
to figure it out, I'm here.

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:50.281
I know you are.

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:51.583
[meg giggles]

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:52.984
look who I found.

00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:55.286
Hey. What are you doing here?

00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:57.222
Are you doing some
last minute christmas shopping?

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:58.423
Oh, I usually like to take a
stroll
through the christmas market

00:10:58.458 --> 00:10:59.991
before the dinner rush.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.660
Yes. Magic.
Well, take a walk with us.

00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:03.228
Sure.

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:05.230
Actually, simon and I
have to go pick up

00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:07.065
a secret christmas present
for somebody.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.667
Are you pointing at me?

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:10.001
-What? No.
-She's pointing at me.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.336
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:13.672
-See you later!
-A christmas surprise!

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.607
Jen: What are christmas tapas?

00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:17.809
Um, impossible to describe.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.144
Okay.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.779
It's a rotating menu.

00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:21.813
So the only thing
you know for sure

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.615
is that it's going to be
delicious.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.651
Oh, I think I'm going to have

00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:28.486
the rosemary potatoes,

00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:29.654
and the green beans
look really good too.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.122
-Christmas dinner.
-Both: Yes!

00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:32.624
Hi there.
What can I get for you?

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:34.259
So hard to decide.

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:34.859
Do you guys have
a sampler platter?

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:37.862
Yes. Oh, hey.

00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:39.631
You're back. You were...
You were here yesterday.

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.199
Yes, I was.

00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:43.535
And the day before.

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:47.172
Yes. Correct.
Everything here
is so good looking.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.007
[jen giggles]
-wait, no, no.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.276
What I meant is that
everything here

00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:53.278
looks so good, and I'll have
the sampler platter.

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:54.612
Uh, two of those?

00:11:54.648 --> 00:11:56.214
Yes, please. Thank you.

00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:57.716
Great.

00:11:57.784 --> 00:11:59.317
You are deeply smooth.

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:01.219
I'm obvious.
It's my super power.

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:01.720
[jen giggles]

00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:06.057
okay. So today I have combined

00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:08.326
the red potato
rosemary coquettes,

00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:10.061
and the turkey and gravy
on a biscuit

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.996
and green beans
with a dash of spice.

00:12:12.032 --> 00:12:13.965
Thank you so much.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.400
-Thank you. Tell your friends.
-Mm-hmm.

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:17.802
And keep coming back.

00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:19.637
I'll see you again tomorrow.

00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:20.705
I am counting on that.

00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:29.214
Thanks for being my wing woman.

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.015
Oh, I didn't do anything.

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:32.884
I just stood there and giggled.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.018
Well, what could be more
helpful?

00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:34.319
[jen giggles]

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.232
mm.

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:50.668
Mm.

00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:54.272
Meg: I mean, why don't you
just stay longer?

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:56.941
-Really?
-Yeah. Stay as long as you want.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.445
I mean, I would love it.

00:13:00.514 --> 00:13:02.413
I might have to borrow
some clothes.

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.849
I love that you're even
pretending to ask.

00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:05.884
You're wearing one of
my sweaters right now.

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:08.286
Shoot.

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:13.091
feel like I should stay too

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.426
and help joe and the staff
plan the party.

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.595
But I don't want to disappoint
mom and dad.

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:18.563
Well, ulmer and sprig
feels like

00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:19.898
a pretty well-oiled machine.

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:21.533
You deserve to enjoy it.

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:23.802
What are you--

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.537
-that's better.
-Really?

00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:26.070
Goes with the sweater.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:32.076
Alright, so then,
I'll help with the madison,

00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:34.112
and help with mom and dad,

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.580
and you just stay
and take some space.

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:36.414
I'm glad you're here.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.984
What's happening?

00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:41.452
It's so cute.

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:42.587
-Is it?
-It's your new look.

00:13:42.622 --> 00:13:43.621
It's who you are now.

00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:46.090
[both laugh]

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:47.926
-whoo! Alright, here.
-Yeah?

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:49.961
Give these to mom

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.162
and have her open them
one at a time.

00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:53.965
Oh, that's a good idea.
That's so sweet.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.968
Also, go to the antique booth
at the christmas market

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.336
Ã´cause they might have some
more of
those christmas village pieces.

00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:00.572
-Oh, I will.
-Okay.

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:03.241
Simon, drive safely. I love
you guys.

00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:04.242
-Love you!
-Love you, too.

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:04.909
Seatbelts.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:10.181
Go, simon! Whoo-hoo!

00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:13.751

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.992
that's all that I have.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.160
But I can get you
something else.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.028
That's a lot of mistletoe.

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:24.829
Hey. I thought you
were going back to...

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:27.465
Yeah. Change of plans.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.833
Gonna stick around for another
couple of days. What is this?

00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:31.369
Uh, just uh, buying some holly.
For the party.

00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:35.540
Holly has red berries.
This is mistletoe.

00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:38.443
So unless this the theme of your
christmas party is kissing,

00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:39.644
which, by the way,
sounds like a very fun party.

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.045
No, no, no.

00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:42.881
People would love that.

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:45.283
Yeah, no, I honestly thought
this was uh...

00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:47.118
-Oh, no, honestly.
-Holly.

00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:48.686
Honest. Honest mistake.
Happens with greenery.

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:53.157
Okay, um... Uh, pine garland.

00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:54.192
I never really got
the whole mistletoe thing.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:57.662
When I was in high school,

00:14:57.697 --> 00:14:59.130
I had a huge crush
on this guy named justin leach.

00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:00.899
Oh, I went to the christmas
party,

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:03.368
and I stood underneath
the mistletoe for hours.

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:04.469
-Full size. Thank you.
-Waiting.

00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:07.038
He's married now. Not to me.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.207
To this woman who's like,
amazing.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:10.041
-Got it.
-You want me to carry that?

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.043
You got any more?

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.411
I can carry it.
Here. I can carry it.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.014
So, this party.
Tell me the plan.

00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:18.483
Well, I've been working really
hard to get us nominated.

00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:20.585
I put aside some money
for a budget.

00:15:20.654 --> 00:15:23.154
Obviously, the food is ready,
uh the decorations, and...

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:24.522
Photo booth.

00:15:24.557 --> 00:15:26.357
The photo booth?

00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:27.358
You're not gonna have a photo
booth?

00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:30.528
I hadn't...Considered uh...

00:15:30.563 --> 00:15:32.697
Photo booths are kind of hokey.

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:34.332
No. Especially not a christmas
one.

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:35.667
Do you throw a lot
of christmas parties?

00:15:35.702 --> 00:15:37.902
Sometimes. Yeah.

00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:40.838
Well, or engagement parties.
Bridal showers. I'm--

00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:42.707
sort of the town busybody?

00:15:42.742 --> 00:15:45.510
-What? No.
-I'm sorry. I'm just...

00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:47.412
I've always thought of myself
as cheerfully helpful.

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.713
Although I guess
that's what you'd think

00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:49.681
if you were the town busybody.

00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:51.182
You know what?

00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:52.750
The photo booth is a good idea.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:55.453
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:56.587
Victoria: Okay, team.

00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:58.623
Cookies, frosting.

00:15:58.692 --> 00:16:00.758

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:03.194
(both laughing)
come here.

00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:05.697
And the world's most delightful
kid sister.

00:16:05.732 --> 00:16:07.031
You know victoria too.

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:09.033
Oh, yeah.

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:10.301
She and jennifer used to
come home from college,

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.270
and I'd follow them around
like a puppy.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:15.106
Turns out, she was cooler
than both of us.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.376
Alex: We started
a tradition last year.

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:20.478
Free cookies with every order
during the holiday season.

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:24.215
Automatic cookies.
Who doesn't love that?

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.049
[christmas music plays
behind inaudible chatter]

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.656
thank you very much.

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:36.461
Draw and outward.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:38.563

00:16:43.603 --> 00:16:44.302
huh?

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:48.973

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.909
â™ª o christmas tree
o christmas tree â™ª

00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:52.677
meg: Oh, okay.

00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:56.414
alex: Make it christmassy.

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:58.616
Your reindeer is wearing a
sweater.

00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:01.152
She's festive.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.187
You know, we should consider
a cookie decorating

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:04.322
station at the party.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.690
-Yes!
-Love that!

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:08.092
Hold up.
We agreed to keep it simple.

00:17:08.128 --> 00:17:09.794
This is a big opportunity for us
and the food bank.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:13.031
You need to come volunteer
with us.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.133
It's got a lot of heart, that
place,
but running on a shoestring.

00:17:15.168 --> 00:17:16.334
I would love to,
and you know another thing

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.369
we could do
for the christmas party--

00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:20.371
you know, while I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.340
jennifer and I have a plan.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:23.841
Food for a distinguished palate.
Hmm?

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:26.177
Multiple courses, huh?

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.179
And string music.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:33.384
Hmm.
Very prim victorian christmas.

00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:36.687
Listen, I love this place, but
judging by the decor alone,

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:38.956
I feel like it could use
a little life.

00:17:38.992 --> 00:17:42.193
We agreed on a plan as a team.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.694
We don't want to bite off
more than we can chew.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.229
Victoria:
No, I'm with meg on this one.

00:17:45.298 --> 00:17:46.164
All in favor of adding
more ideas?

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.037

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:56.541
okay. Alright.

00:17:57.644 --> 00:18:00.344
S going on with you?

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:04.682
Ah...The family's good.

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.684
Meg: Yeah.

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:07.752
My sister's having triplets
in a few weeks.

00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:09.854
Three times the joy.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.289
And three times
the cribs and toys.

00:18:11.324 --> 00:18:13.091
(meg laughs)

00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:16.327
anyway, I also applied
for a dream job

00:18:16.362 --> 00:18:18.162
I'll never get.
It's with naidre miller.

00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:19.530
The naidre miller?

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.499
Yes. Yes.

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:23.668
It's in l.A.
Closer to my family.

00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:25.970
You know,
even though it's feeling

00:18:26.005 --> 00:18:27.438
like I'd be leaving
your sister in a lurch,

00:18:27.474 --> 00:18:29.107
she's been really supportive.

00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:30.875
Yeah, that's jen.

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:33.444
She always wants
what's best for people.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.847
Hey, I'll make myself useful.
I got it.

00:18:35.882 --> 00:18:37.115
-Thank you.
-Where's it going?

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:37.782
-Table 10.
-10. Got it.

00:18:40.854 --> 00:18:40.985
Where am I going?

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.192
Hello there, sir.

00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:50.728
Well...Wait. You're not
jennifer.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.897
No. I am not. But I am
wearing her sweater.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.499
I'm her sister meg.

00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:56.200
Resemblance is...Stunning.

00:18:56.236 --> 00:18:57.702
Oh. (giggles)

00:18:57.737 --> 00:18:59.670
-I'm frank.
-Hi, frank.

00:18:59.706 --> 00:19:01.506
You must be a regular here.

00:19:01.541 --> 00:19:02.540
It's good to have
a neighborhood place.

00:19:02.575 --> 00:19:04.809
They take care of me.

00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:05.977
Plus they go heavy on
the rosemary and the--

00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:08.146
-chervil. Yes.
-(frank laughs)

00:19:08.181 --> 00:19:10.047
we grew up in a restaurant
and my uncle

00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:11.315
ran this movie theater,
so it's really all about...

00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:13.151
Joe: Meg?

00:19:13.186 --> 00:19:14.085
...People coming in--
-can I...

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:15.686
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Excuse me.

00:19:15.722 --> 00:19:17.321
Hope to see you again, meg.

00:19:17.357 --> 00:19:18.156
You, too, frank.
You're a delight.

00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:24.595
Nice guy.

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.330
Yeah. Lots of people eat alone.

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:27.899
It's fine to just--

00:19:27.934 --> 00:19:31.202
oh, no.
I was just being friendly.

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:33.037
It worked out. He likes herbs,
I like herbs.

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:35.907
Listen. I wanted you to know
that I heard your ideas.

00:19:35.942 --> 00:19:38.576
And I am very, very excited
about those ideas.

00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:40.678
But, in the interest
of simplicity...

00:19:40.713 --> 00:19:42.513
I was thinking simple too.

00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:44.215
Juggling elves. Holiday karaoke.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.784
Clowns bowling in santa hats.

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.020
I'm joking. That was a joke.

00:19:49.055 --> 00:19:50.922
You didn't laugh. Huh.

00:19:50.957 --> 00:19:52.557
Look, if we take on
too much and fail,

00:19:52.592 --> 00:19:53.858
we won't get the prize money.

00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:57.428
Or the publicity. You know?

00:19:57.463 --> 00:19:59.230
I want umber and sprig
to take the next step.

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:00.698
To grow.

00:20:00.733 --> 00:20:02.767
Yes. And I do, too.

00:20:02.802 --> 00:20:04.135
I know my sister does as well.
I promise.

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:06.771
But it's more than that.

00:20:06.806 --> 00:20:09.440
We have some time
before dinner service.

00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:10.575
Are you up for a field trip?

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:19.984
Here it is.

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:22.220
Wow.

00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:23.788
So, I'd been volunteering here

00:20:23.823 --> 00:20:25.890
for a long time,
and then your sister and her

00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:27.592
staff started showing up
once a week,

00:20:27.627 --> 00:20:28.392
and just one big, fun group.

00:20:28.428 --> 00:20:30.795
Hmm.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.230
I got to know them, and one
thing led to another,

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:35.299
and uh,
then I asked your sister

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:37.501
if she needed someone
to run the place.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.469
Out of the blue you just asked
to run a restaurant?

00:20:38.504 --> 00:20:40.171
Well, I have a resume.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.306
It's kind of always
been my thing, you know.

00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:44.742
You know, bars, restaurants,
you name it,

00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:46.410
always make the best jobs.

00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:48.145
And I knew
working for your sister

00:20:48.181 --> 00:20:49.480
would let me carve out time
to volunteer here.

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:51.449
Mm.

00:20:51.484 --> 00:20:53.017
And there's just so much
need right now.

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:55.186
So, we do what we can.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:58.322
Joe! I wasn't expecting you.

00:20:58.358 --> 00:21:01.792
The place looks great.
And that sweater.

00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:05.162
Oh, yes. I am like sleigh bells
and sensible shoes. Listen

00:21:05.198 --> 00:21:07.832
[bells jingle]
-[meg laughs]

00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:10.534
you have to be jennifer's
sister.
I'm maryanne.

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.169
Meg. Nice to meet you.

00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:14.472
So, we were chosen

00:21:14.507 --> 00:21:15.373
for that contest
I was telling you about.

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:17.441
Oh, wow!

00:21:17.477 --> 00:21:19.277
And if we win, it's $25,000

00:21:19.312 --> 00:21:20.444
to the charity
of our choice.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.179
I know you have plans to build.

00:21:22.215 --> 00:21:24.949
Ok, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to cry.

00:21:24.984 --> 00:21:27.652
I...Any act of kindness, and
here come the waterworks.

00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:29.153
No, it's good. Let it out.
Feel the feelings.

00:21:29.188 --> 00:21:31.022
Well, wait. We haven't won yet.

00:21:31.057 --> 00:21:32.690
I know,
but it would mean so much.

00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:34.625
See, right now,

00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:37.028
we pre-pack
boxes of food for people.

00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:39.697
But we want it to be
more like a grocery store.

00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:41.365
Where people can come in
and choose.

00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:43.534
Oh, I'd love that.

00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:45.303
There are these places that
are popping up everywhere.

00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:46.637
There's one in santa barbara.

00:21:46.673 --> 00:21:48.205
One in nashville.

00:21:48.241 --> 00:21:49.640
They call it the store,
but I call it

00:22:00.753 --> 00:22:03.187
already needs
some adjustments, of course.

00:22:03.222 --> 00:22:06.424
I figure we could put
produce here,

00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:08.859
and the refrigerator section
here.
I mean,

00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:11.896
it's big enough, right?

00:22:11.931 --> 00:22:14.732
Wow, this would be so amazing.

00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:16.567
Well, hopefully the prize
money will allow for that.

00:22:16.602 --> 00:22:18.703
Well, with the
$25,000 seed money,

00:22:18.738 --> 00:22:21.005
I mean, we would qualify
for a ton of grants,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.341
and nonprofit matching funds.

00:22:23.376 --> 00:22:26.510
It'd be a lot of work,
but it'd be so worth it.

00:22:26.546 --> 00:22:29.113
We will work so hard
to make this happen for you.

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:29.413
Maryanne: Oh, thank you.

00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:34.618
But if we get the word out
to enough people,

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.587
if we get the right publicity.

00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:38.422
Yeah, we can't get ahead
of ourselves.

00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:40.591
We're a small staff, meg,
with limited resources.

00:22:40.626 --> 00:22:42.026
Well, but you have me.

00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:43.294
For how long?

00:22:43.363 --> 00:22:44.428
Hey, joe. You got a minute?

00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:53.137
[phone rings]

00:22:53.206 --> 00:22:55.139
meg?

00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:56.907
Does my name not come up
when I call?

00:22:56.943 --> 00:22:58.876
I hope I'm listed in your phone.

00:22:58.911 --> 00:23:00.644
Very funny. Alright.
How are things there?

00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:02.913
-Honestly, it's amazing.
-Yeah?

00:23:02.949 --> 00:23:05.716
I love this city!

00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:07.318
And joe showed me
the food bank,

00:23:07.387 --> 00:23:09.787
and I'm really enjoying myself.

00:23:09.822 --> 00:23:11.822
Oh, maryanne's a real
ball of fire, isn't she?

00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:14.325
Oh, she's great! I love her.

00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:18.129
And I want to help your staff
throw a blow-out party.

00:23:18.164 --> 00:23:19.730
So, I was thinking,
what if I didn't

00:23:19.766 --> 00:23:21.632
go back to hazelwood?

00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:24.402
I think that's really smart.

00:23:24.437 --> 00:23:26.070
You don't think mom and dad
are gonna be upset

00:23:26.105 --> 00:23:28.439
if I stay here
for a couple more days?

00:23:28.474 --> 00:23:29.974
I think they'd be glad
you're trying something new.

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:35.279
Oh, sister swap. I love this!

00:23:35.314 --> 00:23:36.981
I do too. Alright,
I'm gonna tell joe

00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:38.582
that you're helping out, okay?

00:23:38.618 --> 00:23:40.751
Oh, no, no. Let me.
I can handle it.

00:23:40.787 --> 00:23:43.954
Okay, alright. Well, um...

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.156
I love you. Call me
if anything comes up, okay?

00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:46.023
I promise I will.

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:47.158
I love you, too.

00:23:47.193 --> 00:23:49.160
Bye.

00:23:49.195 --> 00:23:49.593
Also, I'm never giving back
this coat.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.200
I've just never seen you
take a night off before.

00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:57.635
Everything okay?

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.203
Yeah. I...I have a date.

00:23:59.272 --> 00:24:01.338
-But if you need me...
-No, no, no.

00:24:01.374 --> 00:24:05.042
No! I'm happy for you.
Take a chance, man.

00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:06.110
Thank you.

00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:07.278
Good luck.

00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:08.779
Alex: Thank you.

00:24:08.815 --> 00:24:10.714
-Hey there.
-Hey.

00:24:10.783 --> 00:24:11.982
Is that the rsvp list
for the party?

00:24:12.018 --> 00:24:13.818
Uh, yeah, slow going so far,

00:24:13.853 --> 00:24:16.654
but uh, we'll catch up.

00:24:16.689 --> 00:24:18.355
We should get a mailing list
and send out an email blast.

00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:20.357
Also, bear with me,

00:24:20.393 --> 00:24:22.193
what if, in terms
of the decorations,

00:24:22.228 --> 00:24:24.862
what if we go big?

00:24:24.897 --> 00:24:25.863
I'm sorry,
am I missing something here?

00:24:25.898 --> 00:24:27.465
Do you work here now?

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.834
Oh, uh, sort of.

00:24:29.869 --> 00:24:32.002
I had a little chat
with jennifer,

00:24:32.038 --> 00:24:33.838
and I'm gonna be helping out

00:24:33.873 --> 00:24:35.005
with the planning of the party.

00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:37.374
Well, uh...

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:43.080
I don't want to end up with
20-feet of mistletoe, so...

00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:44.815
Why don't we meet
in the morning? Go shopping.

00:24:44.851 --> 00:24:45.349
-Perfect!
-Perfect!

00:24:49.555 --> 00:24:50.354
Ow.

00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:01.899
-Hey.
-Hi.

00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:02.933
-You wanted to meet me here?
-Yes. Come on in.

00:25:02.969 --> 00:25:03.634
Alright.

00:25:05.238 --> 00:25:08.806
Oh...Wow!

00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:11.242
Oh, my sister told me
about this installation

00:25:11.277 --> 00:25:13.310
but I didn't know
it would be so beautiful.

00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:16.747
Yeah. People come from all over
every year to see this.

00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:18.716
I think we should get an artist

00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:20.251
to do an installation
for the party.

00:25:20.286 --> 00:25:21.418
Yeah, meg, I...

00:25:21.454 --> 00:25:23.821
No, come on.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:24.955
You said people come
from all over the place.

00:25:24.991 --> 00:25:27.157
They'll flock to our party.

00:25:27.226 --> 00:25:29.660
Throw in a couple of
activities. Come on.

00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:31.462
Yeah, but after yesterday,
I'm a little worried

00:25:31.497 --> 00:25:34.798
about what you mean
by activities?

00:25:34.834 --> 00:25:37.434
A good christmas party
needs things to do.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.336
-Take weddings. For example.
-Mm-hmm.

00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:40.938
They're fun because you get
to watch the groom dance

00:25:40.973 --> 00:25:43.807
with his mom.

00:25:43.843 --> 00:25:44.808
Someone throws something
you can catch.

00:25:44.844 --> 00:25:46.277
Cake in the face!

00:25:46.312 --> 00:25:47.745
Yeah, but for a christmas
party--

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.748
it's the same thing.

00:25:50.783 --> 00:25:52.182
A party where you stand around
all
day in your formal clothes,

00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:55.085
that's a party you leave.

00:25:55.121 --> 00:25:57.354
That's a middle school dance.

00:25:57.423 --> 00:25:58.322
Did you go
to a middle school dance?

00:26:00.326 --> 00:26:01.692
Were you not fun?

00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:03.627
I was fun.

00:26:03.663 --> 00:26:06.864
But my family
kept christmas simple.

00:26:06.933 --> 00:26:08.666
You know, my parents
liked to travel a lot,

00:26:08.701 --> 00:26:11.669
and I...I honestly liked to
volunteer over the holidays.

00:26:11.704 --> 00:26:13.604
Oh, yeah. My sister told me
about the holiday traditions

00:26:13.639 --> 00:26:15.673
of the wait staff.

00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:16.941
And no matter what,
I always make sure

00:26:16.976 --> 00:26:18.475
that it was for everybody.

00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:20.511
Because we have to build

00:26:20.546 --> 00:26:22.513
the community
that we want, right?

00:26:22.548 --> 00:26:23.981
That's what our party
should be about.

00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:26.450
It should be about community.

00:26:26.485 --> 00:26:29.853
You know, a big celebration,
you know.

00:26:29.889 --> 00:26:31.522
-Get 'em dancing.
-Get 'em dancing, huh?

00:26:31.557 --> 00:26:33.190
-Oh.
-Yes.

00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:34.391
Oh, dancing, huh?

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.694
Whoo!

00:26:36.729 --> 00:26:37.861
Yeah, well, we don't have much
time before the lunch rush,

00:26:37.897 --> 00:26:39.897
and this is a little more

00:26:39.966 --> 00:26:42.066
elaborate than the holly wreaths
that I was thinking.

00:26:42.134 --> 00:26:44.568
I'll get a quote for
the poinsettias.

00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:46.136
That guy looks like
he might know.

00:26:46.172 --> 00:26:46.804
Yeah, wait, but uh...

00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:58.682
Hey, frank.
You have a good lunch today?

00:26:58.718 --> 00:27:00.918
As it always is.
A good routine is the key

00:27:00.987 --> 00:27:02.720
to a healthy life. And...

00:27:02.755 --> 00:27:05.022
Sometimes you get free cookies.

00:27:05.057 --> 00:27:07.891
holiday travel coming up?

00:27:07.927 --> 00:27:13.831
Um...No. Not so much anymore.

00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:16.367
I have a daughter,
but we celebrate separately.

00:27:16.402 --> 00:27:18.669
Oh.

00:27:18.704 --> 00:27:21.238
Alex, how'd the date go?

00:27:21.273 --> 00:27:23.240
Yes, I was curious
about this as well.

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:24.742
Was it stressful trying to
figure out what to wear?

00:27:24.777 --> 00:27:26.877
-I always find that part
stressful.
-Where'd you go?

00:27:26.912 --> 00:27:31.682
-It was fun. And he's great.
-Oh.

00:27:31.717 --> 00:27:34.385
And I invited him to our
volunteer shift tomorrow.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.120
So I'm gonna need you
to play it cool, mom and dad.

00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:38.188
Frank: Y'all volunteer?

00:27:38.224 --> 00:27:40.858
Together? Where?

00:27:40.893 --> 00:27:42.292
The big mountain food bank.

00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:44.561
We take a shift once a week.

00:27:44.597 --> 00:27:46.130
You should come and join us
sometime, frank.

00:27:46.198 --> 00:27:47.598
-I'd love to.
-Great.

00:27:47.633 --> 00:27:48.532
Tomorrow morning. 8am.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.103
And you, mister.

00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:53.437
We have a date with some
wreaths and trees.

00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:54.038
Ah.

00:27:56.409 --> 00:27:58.308
Joe: Hey, look at this beauty.

00:27:58.377 --> 00:28:00.310
Okay. So in a fantasy world,

00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:02.312
in addition
to the poinsettias,

00:28:02.381 --> 00:28:04.381
what if we have one
really big tree,

00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:06.717
like enormous, tall, and fat.

00:28:06.752 --> 00:28:08.819
Where would the people stand?

00:28:08.888 --> 00:28:11.955
Have you seen the rsvp list?
We've got 18 people coming.

00:28:11.991 --> 00:28:14.124
I think we'll be able
to make room.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.794
But we have one big tree that
we can all decorate, right?

00:28:16.829 --> 00:28:18.562
Not as a kid.

00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:20.397
I always wanted
an enormous tree,

00:28:20.433 --> 00:28:21.799
but my parents
wouldn't let me get one,

00:28:21.834 --> 00:28:23.067
because they were afraid
it would take up

00:28:23.102 --> 00:28:23.934
too much space
in the living room.

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:26.136
-Me too.
-Really?

00:28:26.172 --> 00:28:28.505
Yeah. But, I would always say

00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:30.174
we can cut the bottom out

00:28:30.242 --> 00:28:31.675
and we can make

00:28:31.744 --> 00:28:32.943
a wreath.

00:28:32.978 --> 00:28:34.311
Out of the scraps.

00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:35.779
Both: Great minds.

00:28:35.815 --> 00:28:37.081
[meg laughs]

00:28:37.116 --> 00:28:38.649
so this is what small town

00:28:38.684 --> 00:28:42.352
christmas traditions are.

00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:45.289
You and some ski patrol dude
making wreaths together.

00:28:45.324 --> 00:28:46.590
Well, I'm from
a very small town,

00:28:46.625 --> 00:28:48.358
so there's one
ski patrol dude,

00:28:48.427 --> 00:28:50.160
and he's older than my dad.

00:28:50.196 --> 00:28:51.495
-[joe laughs]
-what about you?

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.130
You bring a lot of women

00:28:53.165 --> 00:28:54.865
to the old wreath-making table?

00:28:54.934 --> 00:28:56.800
Because getting your hands
full of sap

00:28:56.836 --> 00:28:59.269
and making something with
questionable
artistic taste

00:28:59.305 --> 00:29:01.271
is a solid date.

00:29:01.307 --> 00:29:03.607
Well, you can't beat
the pine scented air.

00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:04.942
[cell phone buzzes]

00:29:07.813 --> 00:29:09.546
oh, uh...
I gotta take this.

00:29:09.615 --> 00:29:11.048
Yeah, sure. Go take that.

00:29:11.117 --> 00:29:13.684
We're about done here.

00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:14.685
We can hang these wreaths up
at the restaurant.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.720
It'll be beautiful.

00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:18.822
We can put it up on the wall,
and we can...Okay.

00:29:18.858 --> 00:29:19.523
Joe: Hello?

00:29:21.861 --> 00:29:24.962
Hi. Psst. Excuse me.

00:29:24.997 --> 00:29:27.464
Could you help me get like

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.467
a big centerpiece type tree,
like a

00:29:30.503 --> 00:29:33.003
double wide,
but it's kind of a surprise.

00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:35.539
No. No, it's no problem.

00:29:35.574 --> 00:29:38.308
Okay. Thank you.
Merry christmas.

00:29:38.344 --> 00:29:42.045
Sir, um,
I'm looking for a tree

00:29:42.081 --> 00:29:44.148
that's kind of uh,
double wide.

00:29:44.183 --> 00:29:45.549
-Like this one?
-Yes.

00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:46.316
Okay.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.153
And uh...It's a, it's a
surprise. So shh. Okay.

00:29:57.263 --> 00:29:57.995
[facetime rings on cell phone]

00:30:05.571 --> 00:30:07.671
hey, meg!

00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:09.439
Oh, hi, everybody.
I miss you!

00:30:09.508 --> 00:30:10.874
Are you decorating the tree?

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.210
We are! How are you?

00:30:13.245 --> 00:30:14.077
Um...

00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:17.247
Wait right there.

00:30:20.286 --> 00:30:23.287
Then all of a sudden,
it just hit me like a wave.

00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:24.888
And as much as I wanted
to be there

00:30:24.924 --> 00:30:26.456
for their big night
at the theater,

00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:29.393
I suddenly didn't.
I wanted to be here.

00:30:29.428 --> 00:30:31.895
And you feel okay about it?

00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:33.964
Well, like always,
jen listened.

00:30:34.033 --> 00:30:35.933
Mm-hmm.

00:30:35.968 --> 00:30:37.601
And she let me
feel my feelings.

00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:40.904
And then she had precisely
the right thing to say.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.039
Sisters are amazing.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.876
Sisters are amazing.
[meg chuckles]

00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:47.444
thank you guys once again

00:30:47.479 --> 00:30:49.613
for volunteering
tomorrow morning.

00:30:49.648 --> 00:30:50.948
Hey, we wouldn't miss it.

00:30:50.983 --> 00:30:53.250
Oh, uh, meg.

00:30:53.285 --> 00:30:56.086
I still need a photo for the
email blast invitation.

00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:57.921
Yes. I'm gonna get that for
you tomorrow, I promise.

00:30:57.957 --> 00:30:58.922
Wow. The party's in 7 days.

00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:00.724
No.

00:31:00.759 --> 00:31:01.725
They don't give us
a lot of time

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.893
to plan this thing, do they?

00:31:02.928 --> 00:31:04.661
Well, that's the fun part.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.462
-Good night, guys.
-Bye.

00:31:05.497 --> 00:31:08.098
Good night.

00:31:08.133 --> 00:31:10.334
Hey, I had fun playing christmas
elf with you today.

00:31:10.402 --> 00:31:11.401
Maybe tomorrow
we can go down...

00:31:11.437 --> 00:31:13.070
-Early morning.
-Oh.

00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:15.305
Yeah, I told maryanne
I would go by

00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:17.474
and pick up some supplies
before we show up. No.

00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:19.109
And it's on the way,
so, yeah.

00:31:19.144 --> 00:31:20.077
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:31:20.112 --> 00:31:22.179
Okay.

00:31:22.248 --> 00:31:23.847
Good night, joe.

00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:24.848
Good night, meg.

00:31:29.922 --> 00:31:31.321
Good night, joe.

00:31:31.357 --> 00:31:33.257
Would you stop it.

00:31:33.292 --> 00:31:35.158
[victoria laughs]
I don't want to be rude.

00:31:35.194 --> 00:31:36.760
It's polite to say
good night to someone.

00:31:36.795 --> 00:31:38.462
I don't...
I want to be professional.

00:31:38.497 --> 00:31:39.329
-Yeah.
-That's what you do, say
goodnight

00:31:39.365 --> 00:31:40.797
my, my person that I work with.

00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:41.965
That's what you say!

00:31:42.001 --> 00:31:43.333
Of course, you do.

00:31:52.044 --> 00:31:53.110
All these boxes
have stuff in them.

00:31:56.582 --> 00:31:59.783
Hey, alex. How you doing?

00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:01.385
Christmas tapas.
How are you?

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.086
Good to see you.

00:32:03.122 --> 00:32:04.721
-You too!
-Joe. Welcome aboard.

00:32:04.757 --> 00:32:05.756
-Thanks.
-Oh, uh...

00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:07.624
We brought muffins.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.661
Well, look at this crew.

00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:11.828
There's a lot more
than normal, right?

00:32:11.897 --> 00:32:13.830
Yes. This is martin.

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:15.332
-Hi!
-And frank.

00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:17.267
Hey!

00:32:17.303 --> 00:32:19.336
Oh, well, thank you all
for being here.

00:32:19.405 --> 00:32:21.438
There's so much to do, and I
really appreciate the help.

00:32:21.473 --> 00:32:25.108
-Put us to work.
-Here. Corn.

00:32:25.144 --> 00:32:27.077
No one can find the red
food coloring.

00:32:27.112 --> 00:32:29.012
But we found
the green food coloring.

00:32:29.081 --> 00:32:30.314
So we figured, oh,
that'd be fine, right?

00:32:30.349 --> 00:32:32.082
-It wasn't?
-No, it was not.

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:34.651
But only because I had
swapped sugar for salt.

00:32:34.687 --> 00:32:36.153
So it was green,

00:32:36.188 --> 00:32:38.689
and it was salty.

00:32:38.757 --> 00:32:41.792
Henceforth known as the great
grinch cake christmas.

00:32:41.827 --> 00:32:43.660

00:32:43.696 --> 00:32:45.595
My nia's like that.

00:32:45.631 --> 00:32:47.597
-Is that your daughter?
-Yeah.

00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:49.366
So artistic.
Such a way with words. Just...

00:32:49.435 --> 00:32:53.036
-...Capable. Smart. But uh...
-Hmm.

00:32:53.105 --> 00:32:56.440
I was too strict.
I know that now.

00:32:56.475 --> 00:32:59.843
I worry too much.

00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:02.646
I wanted to protect her so
badly,

00:33:02.681 --> 00:33:05.315
but she needed
to spread her wings, so...

00:33:05.351 --> 00:33:06.683
If I had it to do over, I'd...

00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:08.986
You know, I'm rambling.

00:33:13.892 --> 00:33:15.892
Is that why you don't celebrate
christmas with her?

00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:18.495
It's not just that.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.232
We're both pretty stubborn.

00:33:22.301 --> 00:33:24.001
I got another box here.
It's ready to go.

00:33:30.976 --> 00:33:33.410
People just...
Tell you things, huh?

00:33:33.479 --> 00:33:36.246
Yeah. I have that kind of face.

00:33:36.315 --> 00:33:38.081
It means I get to hear
some great stories.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:38.815
Hmm.

00:33:40.753 --> 00:33:45.589
What if we united them?

00:33:45.657 --> 00:33:48.525
Bring frank's daughter into
the cafÃ±. 01:33:55:15
--:--:--:-- I don't know .

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.228
I mean, it's very kind,

00:33:51.263 --> 00:33:53.663
but that feels like
it be a tiny step too far.

00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:55.699
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

00:33:55.734 --> 00:33:58.268
Hey, we're about done here.

00:33:58.337 --> 00:34:00.837
I've gotta run one errand
before the lunch rush.

00:34:00.873 --> 00:34:01.838
Have you done your
christmas shopping yet?

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:10.247
Oh! This is so perfect.

00:34:10.282 --> 00:34:11.915
It is.

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:13.717
Here you go.
Thank you so much.

00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:15.685
-Oh, thanks. Merry christmas!
-Merry christmas.

00:34:15.721 --> 00:34:18.355
We're adding to my uncle dave's
christmas village

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:20.290
-as a present for my mom.
-Ah.

00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:21.958
It's also a good way
for her to remember him.

00:34:22.027 --> 00:34:23.126
You're heading home
tonight, right,

00:34:23.195 --> 00:34:24.628
uh, for the theater opening?

00:34:24.696 --> 00:34:27.197
Actually, no.
No, and jennifer

00:34:27.232 --> 00:34:28.632
was really cool about me
needing to stay here.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.967
I just can't imagine

00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:32.269
going back to the theater
without
uncle dave, you know.

00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:33.970
Yeah.

00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:36.873
Telling stories
with sound effects.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:38.575
[joe chuckles] 01:34:45:00
--:--:--:--
-Popping his popcorn. -Yeah.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.977
Also, it kind of feels like

00:34:41.046 --> 00:34:43.280
there's something here
that I need to learn.

00:34:43.315 --> 00:34:45.048
When I first started here,

00:34:45.084 --> 00:34:47.617
I felt I was supposed
to be here.

00:34:47.653 --> 00:34:48.919
-You know.
-Mm-hmm.

00:34:48.954 --> 00:34:51.388
I mean, I don't know why.

00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:53.757
But there's just so many things

00:34:53.792 --> 00:34:55.592
I didn't really know how to do.

00:34:55.627 --> 00:34:56.893
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:59.463
Such as?

00:34:59.498 --> 00:35:04.167
Well, I learned I like being
part of a team, you know?

00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:05.769
Finding new ways to create
deeper connections

00:35:05.804 --> 00:35:08.572
with the restaurant, community.

00:35:08.607 --> 00:35:10.140
You really are
a big picture guy, aren't you?

00:35:10.175 --> 00:35:12.776
The details on the other hand,

00:35:12.811 --> 00:35:13.844
the decorations, the publicity.

00:35:13.912 --> 00:35:15.112
Hey.

00:35:15.147 --> 00:35:17.013
I'm learning.

00:35:17.082 --> 00:35:18.648
As a matter of fact,
I told maryanne

00:35:18.684 --> 00:35:20.183
to give me the food bank
donor list.

00:35:20.252 --> 00:35:21.785
As soon as alex is done
with that email blast...

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.487
Invites away.
[exploding sound]

00:35:23.522 --> 00:35:24.921
[exploding sound]

00:35:26.825 --> 00:35:28.125
frank: You know, I'm really

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.427
enjoying myself
this morning, meg.

00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:32.028
Well, I just hope that we win
this party challenge

00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:33.597
so we can help give even more.

00:35:33.632 --> 00:35:34.831
What do you mean?

00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:37.267
If we win the prize money,

00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:38.935
it's gonna go towards expanding
the food bank

00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:39.302
into kind of a free
grocery store.

00:35:39.338 --> 00:35:41.271
Oh.

00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:42.939
Food banks are amazing,
and at the store,

00:35:42.975 --> 00:35:44.274
people have even more
choices.

00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:46.510
Wow. That's awesome.

00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:51.148
Okay! I got you a gift

00:35:51.183 --> 00:35:52.816
that you're really gonna love.

00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:56.119
This is a double wide tree.

00:35:56.155 --> 00:35:58.688
And I got you a gift that
you're really gonna love,

00:35:58.724 --> 00:36:01.358
it's a double,
double wide tree.

00:36:04.563 --> 00:36:05.829
What, are we
selling these things now?

00:36:05.864 --> 00:36:07.664
So let me get this straight,

00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:10.300
uh, you got me a tree, and I
got you a tree.

00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:12.836
Great minds think alike, huh?

00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:14.304
We should take these out back,
put them in some water.

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:17.541
Now hold on. One second.

00:36:17.576 --> 00:36:19.809
Let me just...(strains)hold on.

00:36:19.845 --> 00:36:21.144
Frank?

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.047
Don't move.

00:36:24.082 --> 00:36:26.983
This is a perfect picture
for the email blast

00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:29.019
for the food bank donor list.
They'll love it!

00:36:29.054 --> 00:36:31.421
Ha ha! Yes!
[camera clicks]

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.822
yes. Look at this picture!

00:36:32.858 --> 00:36:35.492
It's so good!

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.527
This is so great.

00:36:37.563 --> 00:36:39.896
Ah, maybe we should start
coordinating

00:36:39.932 --> 00:36:42.432
our screwball mistakes.

00:36:42.501 --> 00:36:44.434
This was the best possible
kind of screwball mistake.

00:36:44.503 --> 00:36:45.835
I agree.

00:36:48.774 --> 00:36:50.173
Actually, maybe you're right
about
trees in the restaurant.

00:36:50.209 --> 00:36:52.108
Maybe we should
put them in the back.

00:36:52.177 --> 00:36:54.444
Dinner prep is handled.

00:36:54.513 --> 00:36:55.879
Everyone in the kitchen
knows what to do.

00:36:55.914 --> 00:36:57.914
This place could run without me.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.916
Which is good 'cause I could
use a break.

00:36:59.952 --> 00:37:01.551
Up for a quick walk?

00:37:01.587 --> 00:37:03.553
Oh, look at these decorations.

00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:06.556
Yeah, salt lake knows how
to do business, for sure.

00:37:06.592 --> 00:37:08.758
Any news from jennifer?

00:37:08.794 --> 00:37:11.294
She's loving spending
so much time with simon.

00:37:11.363 --> 00:37:12.562
I think the theater
really lit something

00:37:12.598 --> 00:37:14.197
inside of her, you know?

00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:17.467
--Hmm.
-What?

00:37:17.536 --> 00:37:19.703
I know it's everyone's first
christmas without your uncle,

00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:20.470
and I'm glad jennifer
and simon are doing well.

00:37:20.539 --> 00:37:22.772
I'm fine. Really.

00:37:22.808 --> 00:37:24.641
I am. I'm having fun.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:26.576
Helping out with the party.
Helping the staff.

00:37:26.612 --> 00:37:28.245
I almost don't want to leave.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.913
But you are, right?
Off to France?

00:37:29.948 --> 00:37:32.415
[cell phone rings]
-I'm...

00:37:32.451 --> 00:37:35.085
-Oh, sorry.
-No problem.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.586
-I have to take this.
-Okay.

00:37:36.622 --> 00:37:37.754
I'll see you
back at the restaurant?

00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:39.256
Of course.

00:37:39.291 --> 00:37:39.923

00:37:43.128 --> 00:37:46.162
take two. It's christmas.

00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:46.963
Thank you.

00:37:49.635 --> 00:37:52.235
Have you seen how many rsvps
we've gotten?

00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:54.504
Oh, wow! This is

00:37:54.573 --> 00:37:56.306
-way too many.
-Really good news.

00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:57.974
This is 20 over what
the restaurant will hold,

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.010
and it's still growing.

00:38:00.078 --> 00:38:03.346
Aw. Well,
it's a real party now.

00:38:03.415 --> 00:38:05.248
Where are we
gonna put all these people?

00:38:05.284 --> 00:38:07.751
And how much christmas cheer
can we spread

00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:10.320
if everyone is waiting outside
trying to get in?

00:38:10.355 --> 00:38:12.622
That's a really good
problem to have.

00:38:12.658 --> 00:38:15.358
Some may even say this
is a christmas miracle.

00:38:15.427 --> 00:38:16.960
I wish I had your optimism.

00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:18.428
Honestly, me too.

00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:20.096
Meg, joe.

00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:24.301
I have news. First...

00:38:24.336 --> 00:38:25.869
I got the job!

00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:28.204
The naidre miller?

00:38:28.273 --> 00:38:30.774
What? Congratulations,
victoria!

00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:32.008
We know how much
you wanted this.

00:38:32.044 --> 00:38:33.777
Thank you.

00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:34.978
I mean, it's terrible for us.

00:38:35.013 --> 00:38:36.112
We're never gonna be the same.

00:38:38.116 --> 00:38:39.182
But we're thrilled, victoria.

00:38:39.217 --> 00:38:41.184
We really are thrilled for you.

00:38:41.219 --> 00:38:43.286
And my sister jane
is having triplets.

00:38:43.322 --> 00:38:45.055
-Yes!
-Whoa.

00:38:45.123 --> 00:38:46.623
I'm so excited to get them
little matching outfits.

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:48.058
No, no, no, no.
She's having them right now.

00:38:48.126 --> 00:38:50.226
As we speak.

00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:52.829
Right now? Is everything okay?

00:38:52.864 --> 00:38:55.398
Yes. Triplets come early.
It's normal, I guess, but,

00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:57.133
but she's going to need help,

00:38:57.169 --> 00:38:59.869
and the job starts soon,
and...

00:38:59.905 --> 00:39:01.204
I have to go.

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:01.871
Tomorrow.

00:39:03.508 --> 00:39:04.841
Tomorrow.

00:39:04.876 --> 00:39:06.910
You're leaving?

00:39:06.978 --> 00:39:08.178
-You're gonna go.
-Okay.

00:39:08.213 --> 00:39:09.846
Okay.

00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:12.749
Of course. Congratulations.

00:39:12.818 --> 00:39:14.150
-This is good news.
-Yeah.

00:39:14.186 --> 00:39:14.984
Yeah. I'm excited for you.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.586
It's huge!

00:39:16.655 --> 00:39:18.188
And don't worry
about this here.

00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:20.256
-Yes.
-We got this.

00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:21.391
-We have totally got this.
-We got this.

00:39:21.426 --> 00:39:23.326
Thank you, guys.

00:39:23.362 --> 00:39:23.993
[joe sighs]

00:39:26.198 --> 00:39:27.564
both: No chef.

00:39:34.172 --> 00:39:38.108
Uh, it's time to call jennifer.

00:39:38.176 --> 00:39:40.510
No. No, I know she needs
to be there.

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:42.746
And my parents need her there.

00:39:42.781 --> 00:39:45.281
And tonight's the opening
of the theater. Just...

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.282
-We can handle this.
-How?

00:39:46.351 --> 00:39:49.285
What's the plan?

00:39:49.354 --> 00:39:50.186
I-I don't know yet.

00:40:10.842 --> 00:40:11.241
[doorbell rings]

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:26.589
hi.

00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:27.924
Hi. I brought coffee.

00:40:27.993 --> 00:40:30.026
Oh. Not cocoa?

00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:31.428
Listen, cocoa is delicious.
I like cocoa a lot.

00:40:31.496 --> 00:40:32.929
But why is it every December

00:40:32.998 --> 00:40:34.330
that's all anyone
ever offers me?

00:40:34.366 --> 00:40:36.332
Why are we suddenly not allowed
to drink coffee?

00:40:36.368 --> 00:40:37.600
It actually sounds like
you could use some coffee.

00:40:37.669 --> 00:40:39.035
Come on in.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.504
Thanks.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.373
So...

00:40:43.408 --> 00:40:44.908
[door closes]

00:40:44.943 --> 00:40:47.177
I came by today
to tell you that

00:40:47.212 --> 00:40:49.245
I didn't tell jennifer yet.

00:40:49.281 --> 00:40:50.547
I appreciate that.

00:40:50.582 --> 00:40:52.015
You know, I'll tell her

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.750
at the hazelwood
park tree lighting.

00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:54.684
But it's my job to tell her,
uh, today.

00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:56.586
If she finds out that we
replaced

00:40:56.621 --> 00:40:58.254
a new head chef
with someone else,

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.557
well, that wouldn't make me
good at my job.

00:41:00.592 --> 00:41:02.959
You know what? Just tell her

00:41:03.028 --> 00:41:03.960
that I've been interviewing
the whole time.

00:41:04.029 --> 00:41:05.261
You absolutely have.

00:41:05.297 --> 00:41:07.530
-Wow.
-Yeah.

00:41:07.566 --> 00:41:09.132
You know what, I'll call her.

00:41:09.201 --> 00:41:11.601
I'll call her up,

00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:14.037
I'll tell her that the search
process is well underway,

00:41:14.072 --> 00:41:15.472
and then I'll counter with
the really good news

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.373
that we've got so many rsvps

00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:18.608
that we've outgrown
the restaurant.

00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:21.778
That doesn't feel better.

00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:23.313
I have a lead on a new chef.

00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:24.647
Oh! You do?

00:41:24.716 --> 00:41:26.449
Jesse collins.

00:41:26.485 --> 00:41:27.817
I know that name.
Why do I know that name?

00:41:27.886 --> 00:41:28.885
Head chef at chez barrel.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.588

Revolutionized the grilled

00:41:33.258 --> 00:41:34.657
He's the guy who built that
big like ice...

00:41:34.726 --> 00:41:35.725
[cell phone rings]

00:41:37.796 --> 00:41:39.462
it's jennifer. You get it.

00:41:39.498 --> 00:41:40.797
I'm not gonna...

00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:42.932
You get it! Tell her!

00:41:42.968 --> 00:41:44.567
I don't know what to say!
Hello, hi, jennifer!

00:41:44.603 --> 00:41:46.636
Jennifer: Meg?

00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:47.971
you're saying. Write it.

00:41:48.006 --> 00:41:49.973
Let me ask you a question.

00:41:50.008 --> 00:41:51.641
When you pick up the phone
to call me,

00:41:51.676 --> 00:41:53.476
how am I listed?

00:41:53.512 --> 00:41:55.745
Does it say my name?
Does it say meg?

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.514
Is it my name that you
click on when--

00:41:57.582 --> 00:41:59.249
jennifer:
What's the expiration date

00:41:59.284 --> 00:42:00.483
on this phone bit of yours?
Is it soon?

00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:02.085
No, it is not.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.152
How was the madison?

00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:05.922
Well, it was 10 degrees

00:42:05.957 --> 00:42:07.991
inside, and the projector broke.

00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:10.693
Also, there was a small fire.

00:42:10.762 --> 00:42:12.629
And then, I got a call
from victoria,

00:42:12.664 --> 00:42:15.098
my now former head chef,

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:17.100
who I'm happy for, but also...

00:42:17.135 --> 00:42:18.668
Yes. I was gonna call you.

00:42:18.703 --> 00:42:20.169
I was gonna call you,

00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:21.504
but I didn't,

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.706
because...

00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:25.642
-Joe wouldn't let me.
-Jennifer: What?

00:42:25.677 --> 00:42:26.876
-Hey!
-Hey.

00:42:26.945 --> 00:42:28.344
Are you kidding?

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.779

00:42:29.814 --> 00:42:32.215
I'm totally kidding.
I'm kidding.

00:42:32.284 --> 00:42:35.818
He did want to call you, but
I told him no because...

00:42:35.854 --> 00:42:38.655
Of um, the madison.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.557
Alright, let's just talk about
this when I get back.

00:42:40.625 --> 00:42:41.658
-For now, just tell me-
-you're coming back here?

00:42:41.693 --> 00:42:43.726
Jennifer: Well, yeah.

00:42:43.795 --> 00:42:45.128
I have to help
find a head chef,

00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:46.563
and I have to check on
the christmas party,

00:42:46.631 --> 00:42:48.631
and make sure the staff
is okay.

00:42:48.667 --> 00:42:50.567
Oh, no, no.
Joe has a lead on a chef.

00:42:50.635 --> 00:42:52.468
Tussy...

00:42:52.504 --> 00:42:53.670
-Lollins.
-What?

00:42:53.705 --> 00:42:55.738
Collins...

00:42:55.807 --> 00:42:57.507
Jes-jesse collins.

00:42:57.542 --> 00:42:58.808
Jennifer:
The grilled cheese guy?

00:42:58.843 --> 00:43:00.510
Yes. With the michelin
asterisks.

00:43:00.545 --> 00:43:02.645
Number signs. I mean, stars.

00:43:02.681 --> 00:43:04.981

00:43:05.016 --> 00:43:07.650
So, see, we have this
completely handled.

00:43:07.686 --> 00:43:09.652
Jennifer: Okay,
but the second

00:43:09.688 --> 00:43:11.721
anything else goes wrong...

00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:13.256
-I'm gonna call you.
-Jennifer: Call me.

00:43:13.325 --> 00:43:14.924
I'm gonna call you.
Of course. Obviously.

00:43:14.993 --> 00:43:15.892

00:43:15.927 --> 00:43:17.927
I love you, too.

00:43:17.996 --> 00:43:19.762
Bye.

00:43:19.831 --> 00:43:22.999
Nailed it.

00:43:23.034 --> 00:43:24.934
A little to the left.

00:43:25.003 --> 00:43:25.768
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's good.

00:43:25.837 --> 00:43:28.104
That's perfect!

00:43:28.173 --> 00:43:31.240
Hey, what are we doing
for the ornaments?

00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:33.376
Oh, just in time.

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:35.745
It looks great in here.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.779
-And I brought the ornaments.
-Alright. Alright.

00:43:36.848 --> 00:43:38.581
Yes.

00:43:41.419 --> 00:43:42.585

on the ornaments.

00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:44.420
Oh.

00:43:44.456 --> 00:43:46.456
I've always wanted to do
an angel tree.

00:43:46.524 --> 00:43:47.790
Ah, but never had time
to set one up.

00:43:47.859 --> 00:43:49.926
You know, the board

00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:51.861
has been asking for years
to hire some extra help.

00:43:51.896 --> 00:43:53.596
-Hmm.
-I agree with the board.

00:43:53.632 --> 00:43:56.532
You do need some help.

00:43:56.568 --> 00:43:58.901
Joe: Guys, guys, guys.
Come here.

00:43:58.937 --> 00:44:02.405
Uh, jesse collins is here.
Fingers crossed.

00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:07.310
W-w-wait. If you can

00:44:07.379 --> 00:44:09.579
lock in jesse collins as our
chef,

00:44:09.614 --> 00:44:12.315
I will go full town
busy body and make sure

00:44:12.384 --> 00:44:14.050
that we can fit 200 bodies
in here for the party.

00:44:14.085 --> 00:44:17.086
Okay. Alright. Jesse!
Jesse.

00:44:22.293 --> 00:44:23.559
Hey, if you need a bigger space
for your party,

00:44:23.595 --> 00:44:25.395
why not use mine?

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.063
The food bank is a big building.

00:44:27.098 --> 00:44:28.498
Capacity is 300.

00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:30.633

-Thank you, maryanne.

00:44:36.341 --> 00:44:37.106
Oh! Hey, meg.

00:44:41.279 --> 00:44:42.478
Oh, hi, there.
Welcome to umber and sprig.

00:44:42.514 --> 00:44:44.647
Table for one?

00:44:44.683 --> 00:44:47.150
Actually, um, this is gonna
sound a little weird.

00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:49.485
Oh. I live for weird.

00:44:49.521 --> 00:44:52.021
I got this email
from the food bank

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.123
inviting me
to your christmas party.

00:44:54.159 --> 00:44:57.527
We love an in person rsvp.

I...Recognized my dad.

Oh! You must be

Yeah. I...He called me

00:45:08.306 --> 00:45:09.839
and left a message
a couple days ago.

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:12.341
Um, and then this photo,

00:45:12.377 --> 00:45:14.444
and I thought, well, actually,

00:45:14.479 --> 00:45:17.447
I thought, maybe if I come down,

00:45:17.482 --> 00:45:18.715
I'm not sure what I thought.

00:45:18.783 --> 00:45:21.484
Joe! Come here!

00:45:21.519 --> 00:45:24.654
[meg giggles] this is nina.

00:45:24.689 --> 00:45:27.557
-This is frank's daughter.
-Oh, wow.

00:45:27.625 --> 00:45:29.392
You know, frank, he's gonna
be in here any minute.

00:45:29.461 --> 00:45:30.460
-Yeah.
-He told me about you.

00:45:30.495 --> 00:45:33.162
I think he misses you.

00:45:33.198 --> 00:45:38.000
You know, I...I'm not sure
this was the best idea. Um,

00:45:38.036 --> 00:45:39.802
-actually, I should go.
-Oh...

00:45:39.838 --> 00:45:41.804
This was a mistake.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.473
You don't have to...Go.

00:45:43.508 --> 00:45:45.074
I wish we could get them
back together.

00:45:45.143 --> 00:45:47.877
That's very kind of you,

00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:50.179
but I don't know if frank
wants to just

00:45:50.215 --> 00:45:52.548
show up and see his daughter
out of the blue.

00:45:52.584 --> 00:45:54.083
Well...

00:45:57.021 --> 00:46:00.356
I don't want frank to spend
christmas all by himself.

00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:02.558
Who says he will?
I mean, for christmas eve,

00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:04.427
I plan on having dinner here at
the restaurant with the staff.

00:46:04.496 --> 00:46:07.396
On christmas day,
I'm handing out coffee,

00:46:07.432 --> 00:46:09.699
and cinnamon rolls
at the food bank.

00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:11.434
Just because you're not spending
christmas with family,

00:46:11.503 --> 00:46:13.870
doesn't mean
you're spending it alone.

00:46:13.905 --> 00:46:16.439
Well, right. Of cour...

00:46:16.508 --> 00:46:19.008
Wait, you don't
see family at all?

00:46:19.043 --> 00:46:21.177
Oh, in January.

00:46:21.212 --> 00:46:24.113

it's easier to get away.

00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:29.619

ah.

00:47:24.142 --> 00:47:26.309
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:47:26.344 --> 00:47:28.010
Brought you a refreshment.

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:28.644
-Oh, thanks.
-You're welcome.

00:47:32.417 --> 00:47:34.517
Jesse collins turned us down
I'm afraid.

00:47:34.586 --> 00:47:36.319
Says he likes where he is.

00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:38.254
Oh, oh, man.

00:47:38.289 --> 00:47:39.589
He called you at midnight?

00:47:39.624 --> 00:47:41.157
Ah, these are chef's hours.

00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:43.526
This is when
all the fun stuff happens.

00:47:43.595 --> 00:47:44.827
How could he not want to
hang out with this bunch?

00:47:46.998 --> 00:47:48.965
I mean, build a community...

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.701
And the people will gather.

00:47:51.769 --> 00:47:53.936
Your sister says that
all the time.

00:47:53.972 --> 00:47:54.704
She got it from my dad.

00:47:57.308 --> 00:48:00.676
That and his knack for
decorations.

00:48:00.712 --> 00:48:02.478
he goes all out, wow.

00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:03.112
It is pretty.

00:48:09.854 --> 00:48:11.787
Well, I guess, um...

00:48:11.823 --> 00:48:15.458
I'll cancel my trip
for the tree lighting,

00:48:15.493 --> 00:48:17.793
and I'll help you find a chef.

00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:21.998
Ah, yes. The famous hazelwood
tree lighting.

00:48:22.033 --> 00:48:26.702
Hang on.
Hazelwood is an hour from here.

00:48:26.738 --> 00:48:28.304
Yeah.

00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:29.138
And we'd go through...

00:48:31.476 --> 00:48:34.410
Are you up for a road trip?

00:48:34.479 --> 00:48:35.745
I have an idea.

00:48:36.748 --> 00:48:53.462
[glasses clink]

00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:54.297
-yeah.
-[giggling]

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.470
oh! Christmas decorations,
and look at the horses!

00:49:01.539 --> 00:49:03.539
We should take a carriage ride!

00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:03.973
-Focus.
-So hard to focus.

00:49:04.042 --> 00:49:06.108
Listen.

00:49:06.144 --> 00:49:08.210
If we can convince julie
to come to umber and sprig

00:49:08.246 --> 00:49:09.578
until we find a chef
replacement--

00:49:09.614 --> 00:49:10.313
problem solved.
And we can celebrate

00:49:10.381 --> 00:49:11.747
with caramel apples!

00:49:11.783 --> 00:49:13.950
And if she says no.

00:49:13.985 --> 00:49:15.384
Then we'll eat the caramel
apples and our feelings.

00:49:19.157 --> 00:49:21.590
Joe miller. Look at you!

00:49:21.626 --> 00:49:23.225
How are you?

00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:23.726
You didn't tell me
you were coming.

00:49:23.761 --> 00:49:25.094
Surprise!

00:49:25.129 --> 00:49:26.162
-Hi.
-How are you?

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.897
I'm fine. How are you?

00:49:27.932 --> 00:49:28.931
-Good. It's good to see you.
-You too.

00:49:28.967 --> 00:49:30.399
-You look great.
-Thanks.

00:49:30.435 --> 00:49:32.601
-It's been a long time.
-It has been.

00:49:32.637 --> 00:49:33.602
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:49:33.638 --> 00:49:35.604
Merry christmas.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.605
Nice to meet you. I'm meg.
Nice to meet you, too.

00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:38.174
-So.
-So.

00:49:38.242 --> 00:49:39.775
Meg and I drove up from salt
lake

00:49:39.811 --> 00:49:41.477
-on a whim because
-oh.

00:49:41.512 --> 00:49:43.946
We have something exciting

00:49:43.982 --> 00:49:45.414
that we want to discuss with
you.

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:48.818
Oh! Okay. Um, you know,

00:49:48.853 --> 00:49:49.952
the lunch rush should take
just a little bit,

00:49:49.988 --> 00:49:51.587
can you guys come back?

00:49:51.622 --> 00:49:52.755
-Of course.
-Yeah.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:54.123
We can entertain ourselves.

00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:55.658
-We can.
-Okay. Okay, great.

00:49:58.596 --> 00:50:00.696
Meg: It's hard to relax
when there's work to do,

00:50:00.765 --> 00:50:03.766
but look at us now.
Smiling even.

00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:05.267
So this is what people
with free time

00:50:05.303 --> 00:50:07.436
and social lives do.

00:50:07.472 --> 00:50:09.171
Grabbing a bite.

00:50:09.207 --> 00:50:11.207
-Going on a date.
-Right?

00:50:11.275 --> 00:50:12.675
When was your last good date?

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:16.178
Ooh. It's been a minute.
Or longer.

00:50:16.214 --> 00:50:17.279
I'm not opposed
to going on them,

00:50:17.315 --> 00:50:19.348
um, I just, I feel like

00:50:19.384 --> 00:50:21.050
I need to figure out
what's next for me

00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:23.119
before I focus on sharing
that with someone.

00:50:25.156 --> 00:50:26.522
[hose whinnies]

00:50:26.557 --> 00:50:27.523
is that,
am I overthinking that?

00:50:27.558 --> 00:50:29.392
No, no, no.

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:33.996
I understand.
I wanna meet someone.

00:50:34.032 --> 00:50:35.831
Eventually have a family.

00:50:35.867 --> 00:50:40.036
But most dates I go on,

00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:42.304
everyone's in such a rush.

00:50:43.074 --> 00:50:43.739
Hmm.

00:50:54.185 --> 00:50:56.352
If you had come sooner,

00:50:56.387 --> 00:50:58.687
I would've absolutely
said yes, but

00:50:58.723 --> 00:51:00.356
they upped my hours
last week.

00:51:00.391 --> 00:51:01.657
Meg: Oh.
So sorry.

00:51:01.692 --> 00:51:03.492
Well, at least let us buy

00:51:03.528 --> 00:51:04.827
some of your caramel apples
for the party.

00:51:04.862 --> 00:51:06.195
-Yes. Absolutely.
-Joe: Okay.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:09.365
So no chef.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.067
Well, victoria set us up
pretty good for now.

00:51:11.102 --> 00:51:13.335
I have faith in the staff.

00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:14.737
At least for a few days.

00:51:19.944 --> 00:51:21.444
Meg: Here it is.
The heart of hazelwood.

00:51:21.512 --> 00:51:23.079
My parents' bakery.

00:51:23.114 --> 00:51:24.613
Oh, it looks so pretty
all lit up.

00:51:24.682 --> 00:51:28.551
Actually, I think I know
what to do with that tree.

00:51:28.586 --> 00:51:29.952
Pull out. Let's keep driving.

00:51:34.792 --> 00:51:37.693

00:51:37.728 --> 00:51:39.762
You know, this is the
perfect place for this guy.

00:51:39.797 --> 00:51:43.432
Was there always a tree
in the theatre?

00:51:43.468 --> 00:51:44.567
Young meg: I think that's
spanish.

00:51:44.602 --> 00:51:46.135
No. El is spanish.

00:51:46.204 --> 00:51:47.470
La is french.

00:51:47.538 --> 00:51:49.939
La like falalalala?

00:51:49.974 --> 00:51:51.073
But it's a nasal thing.

00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:52.108
It's gotta be like...La.

00:51:52.143 --> 00:51:53.909
La?

00:51:53.945 --> 00:51:55.811
Yeah.
Close your nostrils thing.

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.646
See? No matter what you say,
they understand it.

00:51:57.715 --> 00:51:59.415
Your bad french got us into

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:01.784
some of the worst places
with the best people.

00:52:01.819 --> 00:52:03.252
I'll be so excited to see
them when we get there.

00:52:03.287 --> 00:52:04.920
They're such good friends,
you know?

00:52:04.956 --> 00:52:06.655
If I could live...

00:52:06.724 --> 00:52:10.126
-Why don't you?
-Move to paris?

00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:11.093
Eh, things have gone
a different direction.

00:52:11.129 --> 00:52:13.062
If I had the option,

00:52:13.097 --> 00:52:16.765
then maybe, but I mean,

00:52:16.801 --> 00:52:20.136
I have this.

00:52:20.171 --> 00:52:22.638
I love being here.
I mean,

00:52:22.673 --> 00:52:24.406
it's home.

00:52:24.442 --> 00:52:26.075
L'home.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:28.611
-Yes.
-Right?

00:52:28.646 --> 00:52:30.279
L'home. L'home.
L'home.

00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:31.847
Uncle: L'home.

00:52:31.916 --> 00:52:33.482
Meg: That's very strange.

00:52:33.518 --> 00:52:34.250
Meg?

00:52:37.355 --> 00:52:40.956
Yes. Yes.

00:52:40.992 --> 00:52:44.160
There was always a tree
in the madison theater.

00:52:44.195 --> 00:52:48.497
Can I ask why he didn't
leave it to you?

00:52:48.533 --> 00:52:51.267
Oh. (chuckles) uh, well,
we talked about it.

00:52:51.302 --> 00:52:53.836
Um, my family's always had

00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:56.172
restaurants and theaters
in these places

00:52:56.207 --> 00:52:58.107
that became like
little communities.

00:52:58.142 --> 00:52:59.708
That's not you?

00:52:59.777 --> 00:53:02.044
Oh, no. That's totally me.

00:53:02.113 --> 00:53:04.146
I live for that
kind of thing.

00:53:04.182 --> 00:53:06.849
This place just always felt
like it was his.

00:53:06.884 --> 00:53:09.285
Also, I think it's
just too hard

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.452
to be here when he's not.

00:53:13.191 --> 00:53:13.856
Isn't he?

00:53:20.198 --> 00:53:22.464
Seems like he's pretty good
at the details.

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.466
Kind of like something
you live for.

00:53:26.704 --> 00:53:29.205
He did. Yeah.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.373
You know, people leave

00:53:31.409 --> 00:53:32.808
pieces of themselves behind,
you know.

00:53:32.843 --> 00:53:35.177
Not just in places.

00:53:35.213 --> 00:53:36.679
But in the people they love.

00:53:40.184 --> 00:53:41.083
Part of me feels like
I could've taken it over.

00:53:43.421 --> 00:53:44.320
Look at this ticket.

00:53:47.525 --> 00:53:49.692
[crowd cheers]

00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:52.661
oh, tree lighting
is starting up.

00:53:52.697 --> 00:53:53.996
Think I'll join them.

00:53:56.033 --> 00:53:58.834
Hazelwood, are you ready

00:53:58.869 --> 00:54:00.536
to light this christmas tree?

00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:01.503

00:54:05.543 --> 00:54:06.508

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.680

[band plays christmas music]

00:54:17.922 --> 00:54:19.788
â™ª you better watch out

00:54:19.857 --> 00:54:21.557
â™ª you better not cry

00:54:21.592 --> 00:54:24.093
â™ª you better not pout, I'm
telling you why â™ª

â™ª he's making a list

00:54:32.403 --> 00:54:34.303
â™ª and checking it twice

meg! We're over here!

00:54:45.583 --> 00:54:47.316
Hi! Hey, jen!

00:54:47.385 --> 00:54:49.985
Meg and joe?
Wait a minute.

00:54:50.054 --> 00:54:51.620
Who's running the restaurant?

00:54:51.656 --> 00:54:52.655
Alex is in charge
of the kitchen.

00:54:52.723 --> 00:54:53.756
We went to fort morgan farms...

00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:55.224
It's totally under control.

00:54:55.259 --> 00:54:56.625
...To see if maybe julie
wanted to take...

00:54:56.661 --> 00:54:57.493
Wait. One at a time.
What's happening?

00:54:57.561 --> 00:54:59.795
Jesse collins turned us down.

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.664
Meg, you said everything
was under control.

00:55:01.732 --> 00:55:03.265
-It is.
-We just...

00:55:03.301 --> 00:55:04.600
It sounds worse than it is.

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:06.969
I-I promise. We have a whole
plan.

00:55:07.004 --> 00:55:08.304
Wait, so do you have any
other

00:55:08.339 --> 00:55:10.639
prospects for the chef position?

00:55:10.675 --> 00:55:11.640
Are we promoting someone?
What are we doing?

00:55:11.676 --> 00:55:13.575
-Um...
-Well...

00:55:13.611 --> 00:55:15.144
No one's quite ready
to take over,

00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:16.779
but I have some ideas.

00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:18.981
What was I thinking?

00:55:19.016 --> 00:55:20.449
I never should've left
for this long.

00:55:20.484 --> 00:55:21.350
Alright, we're going back
to the city.

00:55:21.419 --> 00:55:22.751
We gotta figure this out.

00:55:22.787 --> 00:55:24.253
Okay, well, what about
the theater?

00:55:24.288 --> 00:55:26.255
-Wait...
-You don't have to...

00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:27.356
Jen, we really,
we have it under control.

00:55:27.425 --> 00:55:28.791
-Yes.
-We really do.

00:55:28.826 --> 00:55:30.292
I'm sorry, meg,
but can you understand

00:55:30.328 --> 00:55:31.593
how it doesn't
seem that way to me?

00:55:37.802 --> 00:55:38.600
Excuse me one minute.

00:55:57.421 --> 00:55:58.787
Jennifer: Simon,
I understand, but--

00:55:58.823 --> 00:56:00.289
no, no. I get that you're
trying to come up

00:56:00.324 --> 00:56:02.324
with what we're doing next,

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.525
and if we have to go back
to salt lake after this,

00:56:03.594 --> 00:56:05.427
and this is all just

00:56:05.463 --> 00:56:06.528
a really good dream, that's
okay.

00:56:06.597 --> 00:56:08.163
I just really
want to make sure

00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:09.264
that we can do this
tomorrow.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:12.935
Okay. Well, I'll turn around

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:13.969
and come back as soon as I
get everything in order.

00:56:14.004 --> 00:56:15.204
I love you.

00:56:15.272 --> 00:56:16.271
I love you, too.

00:56:25.282 --> 00:56:26.682
Meg?

00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:29.151
You can come out now.

00:56:29.186 --> 00:56:32.054
What? No, I'm not--
I just...

00:56:32.123 --> 00:56:34.390
I just wanted to make sure
that this pole was secure.

00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:36.158
The structure
of these whole buildings.

00:56:36.193 --> 00:56:37.526
Of course.

00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:38.727
-Critical.
-Yeah.

00:56:38.796 --> 00:56:40.662
How'd you know I was there?

00:56:40.698 --> 00:56:41.230
You know, I see a lot more than
people give me credit for.

00:56:41.298 --> 00:56:43.165
Come on.

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.969
So, staying in hazelwood,
are you?

00:56:47.004 --> 00:56:48.570
What's that about?

00:56:48.639 --> 00:56:51.974
Are you kidding?
I love it here.

00:56:52.009 --> 00:56:53.175
I mean, we almost have
the theater up and running.

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:54.910
Mom is happier and more relaxed

00:56:54.979 --> 00:56:57.012
than I've seen her in years.

00:56:57.047 --> 00:56:59.715
With the exception of
last night, but that's on me.

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:01.517
Yeah, no. I wouldn't worry
too much about that.

00:57:01.552 --> 00:57:03.152
You guys always bring out
the best in each other.

00:57:03.187 --> 00:57:06.522
Hi! Mom, do you have those
lattes for joe and me?

00:57:06.557 --> 00:57:08.424
Gee, it was good to see you

00:57:08.492 --> 00:57:09.191
at the tree lighting
last night.

00:57:09.226 --> 00:57:11.560
Mm, I had the best time.

00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:13.228
Thank you for lending joe
the couch.

00:57:13.264 --> 00:57:15.197
Joe, we just hope
you were comfortable.

00:57:15.232 --> 00:57:17.533
Oh, it was perfect.

00:57:17.568 --> 00:57:19.568
How often do you get to sleep
next to a christmas tree?

00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:21.603
having you.

00:57:21.672 --> 00:57:23.439
Oh, thank you.

00:57:23.507 --> 00:57:24.706
The more chance we get to
spend time with you,

00:57:24.742 --> 00:57:27.376
before you go to France,
the better.

00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:29.077
Have you bought that
return ticket yet?

00:57:29.113 --> 00:57:30.913
Dad, I know you think
I'm being reckless.

00:57:30.948 --> 00:57:33.348
We have said no such thing.

00:57:33.384 --> 00:57:35.284
If you are sure that this
is what you want to do,

00:57:35.352 --> 00:57:36.852
we support you.

00:57:36.887 --> 00:57:37.553
Thank you.

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:42.057
Well, uh, we should
get on the road.

00:57:42.092 --> 00:57:43.959
Mr. And mrs. Swift.

00:57:44.028 --> 00:57:45.461
-Bye, I love you.
-It was a pleasure.

00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:45.894
-Yes, sir.
-So nice to meet you.

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:48.263
Alright.

00:57:48.299 --> 00:57:50.799
Radio: â™ª we wish you
a merry christmas â™ª

00:57:50.868 --> 00:57:53.268
â™ª we wish you
a merry christmas â™ª

00:57:53.304 --> 00:57:55.871
â™ª we wish you a merry...

00:57:55.906 --> 00:57:58.373
You know, these are classic
christmas
tunes playing here.

00:57:58.409 --> 00:57:59.141
Want to sing along?

00:58:02.313 --> 00:58:04.046
Sorry. I was just trying
to think through

00:58:04.081 --> 00:58:05.481
this chef problem,
that's all.

00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:07.916
Maybe you can send someone
from paris.

00:58:11.088 --> 00:58:13.155
I'm just surprised

00:58:13.224 --> 00:58:15.224
you haven't mentioned
this trip at all.

00:58:15.259 --> 00:58:16.992
Well, I wasn't trying to
keep it a secret.

00:58:17.061 --> 00:58:18.327
-Mm.
-Or anything.

00:58:18.395 --> 00:58:20.162
To be honest,

00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:21.296
I don't even know if
it's what I want.

00:58:26.136 --> 00:58:27.503
There's gotta be someone
right in front of us.

00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:30.572
Chef position.
Someone we're not...

00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:34.243
Hold on. Hold on.

00:58:34.278 --> 00:58:35.844
I have an idea.

00:58:35.913 --> 00:58:37.779
[phone rings]

00:58:37.815 --> 00:58:40.782
hi. Oh, hi. It's me.

00:58:40.818 --> 00:58:42.584
Um, listen, I need you
to find

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.520
my sister jennifer's article

00:58:44.588 --> 00:58:46.755
from great salt magazine
from last year.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.124
And also, talk to me about
the red velvet doughnuts.

00:58:57.201 --> 00:58:58.934
So you think this is
our new chef?

00:58:58.969 --> 00:59:01.203
I mean, martin's great.
I like the guy.

00:59:01.272 --> 00:59:02.971
But I don't think he's ready
for a kitchen like ours.

00:59:03.007 --> 00:59:05.340
His food is best
I've had here.

00:59:05.376 --> 00:59:06.508
Plus, we already know he
fits in with the staff

00:59:06.544 --> 00:59:08.677
which is always a gamble

00:59:08.712 --> 00:59:09.177
when you're hiring
off of an interview.

00:59:09.213 --> 00:59:11.313
That's true.

00:59:11.348 --> 00:59:13.615
-Hey, all. Back--
-hey!

00:59:13.651 --> 00:59:15.017
Wait, you're...
You're jennifer swift.

00:59:15.052 --> 00:59:17.619
Mm, yeah.

00:59:17.655 --> 00:59:19.721
Martin: Wow, okay, uh,
your article last year

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:23.125
in great salt about uh,
hospitality,

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.026
and community building,
like that--

00:59:24.061 --> 00:59:26.628
yeah.

00:59:26.664 --> 00:59:28.196
That is always what I've
believed
restaurants can be.

00:59:28.232 --> 00:59:29.998
Wow. Well, thank you.

00:59:30.034 --> 00:59:32.568
-Thank you so much.
-Of course.

00:59:32.636 --> 00:59:33.802
Um, we'll each have one
of everything, please.

00:59:33.837 --> 00:59:37.072
-Oh, wow!
-Mm-hmm!

00:59:37.141 --> 00:59:38.006
You know, I would
come here every day!

00:59:38.042 --> 00:59:40.208
Of course!

00:59:40.244 --> 00:59:43.912
You know what?
We need someone immediately.

00:59:43.981 --> 00:59:45.347
I say, let's do it.
Let's make him an offer.

00:59:45.382 --> 00:59:46.682
Yeah?

00:59:46.717 --> 00:59:48.383

00:59:48.419 --> 00:59:51.053
okay.
I'll make him an offer.

00:59:51.088 --> 00:59:51.853
Great.

00:59:57.695 --> 01:00:00.162
Are you two...

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:02.564
-Is there...
-Between us? (coughs)

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.433
what? Like a romantic...

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.768
(meg coughs) no. We are--

01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:08.337
work in the store.

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:10.072
I'm just gonna...

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:11.340
Get some water.
(clears throat)

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:17.879
hey, joe. What's going on?

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:19.881
You know, you know
your sister's vision.

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:21.750
And beyond that, you know,
you uh,

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:23.585
push things
to the next level.

01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:24.186
It's been amazing to watch.
And helpful.

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:26.188
Thank you.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:28.557
Martin can cook, I think
the staff and I

01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:30.225
can help him
find his way around.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.593
Bigger kitchen.

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:33.962
So what's going on here?

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:36.865
Well, I was thinking
to myself yesterday,

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.233
on the carriage ride,

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:40.235
that you and I,

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.407
we fit.

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:49.111
Yes. I was thinking it too,

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:50.479
but you said that you wanted
something more permanent.

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:52.214
I know. Um...

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:56.585
And, and you're going off
to France, and uh...

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.488
Maybe not. I don't know.

01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:01.456
Either way, you know,
um...

01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:03.058
Either way,

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:05.560
I have a chef I gotta

01:01:05.596 --> 01:01:06.728
hire and train.

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:11.933
And so, I'll see you
back at the uh...

01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:15.137
Oh, you...

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:20.075
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:20.909
It's complicated.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.480
Come on.

01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:27.816
I'm sorry I didn't trust you,

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:28.583
you really do know
what you're doing, meg.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:31.753
Thanks.

01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:33.689
You okay over there?

01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:37.092
I am. You know,
the longer I'm here,

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:37.526
the more I think maybe
instead of going to France,

01:01:37.594 --> 01:01:39.661
I should

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:42.798
use that money to start
something of my own.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:44.299
I mean, I'm worried that
without uncle dave,

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:46.301
France is gonna feel...

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:48.103
Like hazelwood.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.871
But with better cheese.

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.273
[jennifer chuckles]

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:53.008
you know,

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.310
one thing
I know about grief,

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.646
is that you will get to
the other side of it.

01:01:57.681 --> 01:02:00.849
And it's good to do
what feels best

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.117
while you're
moving through it.

01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:04.186
Maybe for you, that's cheese.

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.353
it feels best

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.122
just sitting here with you.

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:08.323
I'm glad you came back.

01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:10.525
Mm. Me too.

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:12.127
And I'm really excited
to sit next to you

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.195
tomorrow night
and watch a movie.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.196
Yeah.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.799
This is a really good space.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:31.680
Oh, look at her. Wow!

01:02:31.715 --> 01:02:33.715
Whoo!

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:37.185
Hi! (laughs)

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:39.488
oh, hi. Uh, I'm an 8.

01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:40.689
-8. Perfect.
-Yeah.

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:42.924
-Thanks.
-Alex: Hey, meg swift.

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:44.426
-Hello!
-Martin: Hi there!

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:48.997
Meg! Yay! Come on!
Whoo!

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.400
Aah! Whoo! (laughs)

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.903
okay. Oh!

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.338
-Oh!
-Aah!

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.439
You okay? (laughs)

01:02:57.508 --> 01:02:59.374
yeah. I'm good.

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:01.343
No jennifer?

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:02.410
Oh, no. She had to go back
to hazelwood.

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:03.779
Oh, okay.

01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:05.413
I told her we had it.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.549
We got it as long as you
hold on to me.

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:10.018
Oh, you having fun
with your ice skating?

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:11.353
oh, I'm having a blast.

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:13.355
Yeah, seems like it.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.524
And if I take the job,

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:17.626
you're sure you're okay
working together?

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:19.694
Well, the way I see it,

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:21.897
we're both smart,
reasonable people.

01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:23.932
I just, I don't want to risk

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:27.269
whatever...This is for--

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:34.709
just take the job.

01:03:34.745 --> 01:03:36.378
We'll work out
whatever happens next.

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:37.078
Yeah?

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:41.383
Okay.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:43.385
Announcer: Alright, everyone.
Grab a partner

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.754
because it's time for
the mistletoe skate.

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:47.055
â™ª but when you sing

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:52.227
thank you!

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:54.896
â™ª the little things,
like how we flow â™ª

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.938
what you said earlier...

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:04.406
It's like you said before,
you know,

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:05.907
in order to add someone
to your life,

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:09.678
you have to know
what you're looking for.

01:04:09.746 --> 01:04:12.180
And uh,

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:15.283
it's obvious,
you're still searching.

01:04:20.691 --> 01:04:22.924
And so I guess,
we'll throw the best

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.359
christmas party this city's
ever seen.

01:04:27.798 --> 01:04:28.763
Yeah.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.287
Maryanne: I don't want to
disturb anything,

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:53.955
but just think about it.

01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:54.756
Joe: I will.
Thank you, maryanne.

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:02.764
-Hey.
Hey.

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:04.699
Everything okay?

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:07.669
Yeah. Just some uh,

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:08.203
some things for me
to think about, so.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:11.940
It's nice in here, right?

01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:14.342
Yeah. You were right.

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:15.944
The wreaths and the garland
are beautiful.

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:17.479
-Simple, tasteful.
-Oh.

01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:20.615
Not prim or victorian?

01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:22.717
Not until we start
bringing in

01:05:22.786 --> 01:05:23.652
the tiny cakes
with small, ornate spoons.

01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:26.888

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:28.957
We're okay?

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:34.195
Yeah. Yeah, I think
you were right,

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:36.998
I-I don't know
what's next for me.

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:39.034
But the more I think,
about it...

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:44.372
I mean, look at this place.

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:47.075
It has been

01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:50.645
a memorable time,
you know?

01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:52.580
The more I try to pin down
what's next for me,

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.649
the more I think it's,
it's here.

01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:57.852
The restaurant, the people,

01:06:01.224 --> 01:06:03.258
and then I think,
oh, good job.

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:05.260
Meg, you've just imagined
yourself

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:07.696
directly into your
big sister's life.

01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:09.230
And that's not what I want.
I want

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:10.498
something that's mine.

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:12.600
Hmm.

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:13.668
And on and on I go in
my brain around and around.

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:20.075
You know, I have to go.

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:21.543
Um, I have to swing by
the restaurant

01:06:21.578 --> 01:06:23.111
before I head to hazelwood.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:23.845
I'll ride to the restaurant
with you.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.547
Okay.

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:26.081
Yeah, I got a few things
to pick up.

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:28.083
Okay.

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:30.185
Hey, that lunch rush
is kind of taking...

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.853
It's happening. She's here.

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:32.754
Frank's daughter
waiting at his table.

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:36.524
-Okay.
-Yeah.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:37.258
-We gotta be cool.
-Yeah.

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:38.360
Frank's here.

01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:41.429
He's here. Hi.

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:43.732
Uh, frank, how-how are you?

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.400
We have some exciting things
on the menu today

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:46.434
you're gonna enjoy.

01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:49.037
Nina.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.114
How are you?

01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:00.949
-[meg whispering] okay.
-Okay.

01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:02.550
No, wait. Hold on.
Just stay. Be cool.

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:05.320
Just, let's just feel it.

01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:07.155
Just feel it.

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:08.089
I had no idea
you'd be here.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:09.591
[nina inaudible]

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:10.892
I better tell everybody.

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:13.094
Sounds good.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.629
Okay, for frank
and his daughter,

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:16.464
let's send out our very best.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.266
Let's start with
the christmas tapas,

01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:19.434
move on to the soup,
maybe with a garnish--

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:21.302
I got this. Use me.

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:22.470
Really? Okay.

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:29.277
I don't know
what else to do.

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:30.645
Nina, wait.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.480
I came here out of love,

01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:34.315
and you do this every time.

01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:35.617
Frank: Nina...

01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:37.452
Nina: Every time.

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:38.853
Frank: Why do you have to
be a hot head?

01:07:38.922 --> 01:07:39.154
Nina: Oh, gosh, dad.
You'll never change.

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:48.496
Hey.

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:52.767
Some things just...
Take more time, I guess.

01:07:52.803 --> 01:07:53.668
Is there anything we can do
for you?

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:56.004
No. No. Don't worry about me.

01:07:56.039 --> 01:08:00.475
I'm back tomorrow.
But today...

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.875
Today, I'm just not hungry.

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:09.851
Should we...Go after him?

01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:12.787
No. I think I've done enough
meddling for today.

01:08:15.992 --> 01:08:16.791
I gotta get on the road
to hazelwood.

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:42.584
Nobody in this family
does anything by themselves.

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:44.018
Oh, yay!

01:08:44.054 --> 01:08:44.819

01:09:54.124 --> 01:09:54.889
I'll be back.

01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:20.615
Uncle dave: You know, people
aren't always

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:22.650
gonna listen to your ideas
or change their mind,

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:23.151
but that doesn't mean
you stop believing in them.

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:28.256
Uncle dave:
It takes a little patience.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:29.657
And you gotta look
for the right time.

01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:33.828
And then you show 'em
what you got.

01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:35.496
You see? The two of you
working together.

01:10:35.532 --> 01:10:36.831
Always the best plan.

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:37.932
[girls giggling]

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:41.469
I love you.

01:10:41.504 --> 01:10:42.670
I love you, too.

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:49.110

01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:52.880
what if we kept everything

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:55.717
exactly the way it is
right now?

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.318
Hmm.

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:59.821
Whoa.

01:10:59.856 --> 01:11:01.656
Two sweet old ladies
sitting on a countertop.

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:03.191
Emphasis on the old.

01:11:03.226 --> 01:11:04.692
True.

01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:06.694
All I need is you, me,

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:08.730
and a comfortable place
to sit down.

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:11.332
And snacks.
[meg laughs]

01:11:11.368 --> 01:11:12.734
oh. Snacks!

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:15.003
Yes!

01:11:15.038 --> 01:11:15.803
Here.

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:19.907
Nailed it.

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:22.076
Hey, have you been down
to the basement?

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:24.012
It's huge. You know,
it's big enough

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:27.248
for like a working,
restaurant-sized kitchen.

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:29.317
A movie theater/restaurant's
a good idea.

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:30.585
I know, right?

01:11:30.654 --> 01:11:31.486
I cancelled my flight.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:32.920
What?

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:34.922
I love salt lake.

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:36.424
Whatever's next for me,

01:11:36.493 --> 01:11:38.559
I think it's in that city.

01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:40.161
I mean,
if I could work for you,

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:41.763
for a little while...

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:42.563
Oh, my gosh,
well, truth be told,

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:44.232
we should probably

01:11:44.267 --> 01:11:45.600
both: Just go into business
together.

01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:47.335
Wait. So that would mean
we...

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.936
...Pool our resources while...

01:11:49.005 --> 01:11:49.904
...We run the restaurant
together and...

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:51.773
You build the kitchen.

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:53.207
And we keep the madison
in the family.

01:11:53.243 --> 01:11:54.175
And then we build
whatever's next...

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:54.909
Both: Together.

01:12:20.437 --> 01:12:21.235

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:29.877
whoa!

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:37.552
Time to whip up
a batch of brownies

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:40.121
and cuddle up in front of
your favorite cozy flick

01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:41.923
because you're not going
anywhere.

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:43.758
A surprise christmas
snowstorm

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:45.760
has snarled traffic
all over the region.

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:47.929
Expect it to last
through tomorrow

01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:48.730
in downtown salt lake city,

01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:55.002
ooh hoo hoo!
It's really cold!

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:56.237
-Close your eyes.
-Whoa!

01:12:56.272 --> 01:12:58.940
Oh, my gosh.
Is this a prank?

01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:00.608
Am I about to be
sprayed with water?

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:02.577
No. Why would I,
why would I do that?

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:03.578
Just come with me.
Stand here.

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:04.779
What's happening? (laughs)

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:07.148
now. You were right.

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:08.816
A good party needs things
for people to do, so,

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:10.685
our team and I came up
with a few of those.

01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:11.953
Voila.

01:13:11.988 --> 01:13:14.088

01:13:14.124 --> 01:13:15.289
First, we have

01:13:15.325 --> 01:13:17.291
a cookie decorating station.

01:13:17.327 --> 01:13:18.860
Your suggestion.

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:21.429
I am gonna make
an entire fleet

01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:22.830
of reindeer cookies
complete with

01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:23.498
tiny, little
ugly christmas sweaters.

01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:28.002
You said photo booths
were hokey!

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:29.871
And I stand by that.

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:32.273
Does it work?

01:13:32.308 --> 01:13:34.842
Of course, it works.
Here. Here you go.

01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:36.310
You just press this button.
Here, sit.

01:13:36.346 --> 01:13:37.779
-Sit here.
[meg laughs]

01:13:37.814 --> 01:13:39.614
ready? Say cheese!

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:42.850
-Cheese! (laughs)
[camera clicks]

01:13:42.886 --> 01:13:45.653

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:48.656
See? We make a great team,
right?

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:50.224
Yes. We do.

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:52.126
Speaking of which...

01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:53.461
No, wait. I have something
I want to tell you.

01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:56.063
I'm not going to France.
I'm gonna stay.

01:13:56.132 --> 01:13:59.033
Right here.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.369
Details are still being
worked out,

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:03.371
but I'm gonna go into
business with my sister.

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:08.342
Wow. So you're...Staying.

01:14:08.378 --> 01:14:14.148
Yeah. Which, I think,
is good news, for us.

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:14.982
I hope.

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:18.319
Maryanne:
Oh. There you are.

01:14:18.354 --> 01:14:20.021
We have a problem.

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:22.690
The roads are in terrible shape,

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:23.558
and they're asking anyone
who doesn't need to travel

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:25.726
to stay home.

01:14:25.762 --> 01:14:27.728
Are people gonna be able to
get to the party tonight?

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:29.430
[cell phone buzzes]
-I don't know.

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:31.666
It doesn't matter.

01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:33.167
The magazine just cancelled
everything.

01:14:36.506 --> 01:14:37.171
Oh...

01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:46.781
In consolation for cancelling
the parties,

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:48.749
great salt will be
splitting the prize money

01:14:48.785 --> 01:14:50.418
among the chosen charities.

01:14:50.453 --> 01:14:51.552
Wow! So we're still
gonna be getting

01:14:51.588 --> 01:14:52.253
a good deal of money.

01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:54.288
Sounds like it.

01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:56.290
Is that gonna be enough
for you to start the store

01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:57.992
oh, probably not.

01:14:58.061 --> 01:15:00.328
But it will feed a lot
of people.

01:15:00.396 --> 01:15:01.429
More than last year.

01:15:01.464 --> 01:15:03.898
Oh, and joe.

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:05.399
Once you're onboard
full-time,

01:15:05.435 --> 01:15:07.301
maybe we can use
some of the money

01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:07.768
to start the outreach program
you wanted to start.

01:15:07.804 --> 01:15:09.136
Full-time?

01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:10.905
Uh...

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.507
Uh, I got...

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:13.908
Stuff to...Yeah.

01:15:16.646 --> 01:15:18.980
Yeah, um...

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.983
Maryanne offered me
a full-time position.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:23.451
It's longer than the hours
at the restaurant,

01:15:23.486 --> 01:15:25.620
but it's absolutely
what I want

01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:28.456
and uh, I accepted.
She said that

01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:29.457
I could stay as long
as I need to,

01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:30.791
until jennifer finds someone,

01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:33.261
but since that's gonna be you...

01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:36.264
This is great.
You're gonna be so happy.

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:37.431
It's perfect!

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:43.638
We should probably

01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:50.211
figure out the uh... Wait.
Um...

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.446
What does this,
what does this mean about us?

01:15:52.482 --> 01:15:53.848
You and me?

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:54.549
[door opens]

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:01.222
what is this?

01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:03.124
This is rosemary potato
croquettes.

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:04.992
And a bite-size
turkey and stuffing

01:16:05.028 --> 01:16:07.995
on water crackers
with a cranberry reduction.

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:10.331
Yeah, did you guys
not hear about the...

01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:10.898
Oh, yeah. We-we saw the post
about
the party being cancelled

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.667
on our way here.

01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:14.068
We thought we'd see
if maryanne

01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:15.870
can't find a way
to distribute these.

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:17.705
All this food is not
about to go to waste.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:21.909
Hold on. I have an idea. I
have to make a phone call.

01:16:21.978 --> 01:16:24.178
I'm gonna...I... 02:16:32:17
--:--:--:--
You know wha t? This is... I'm
gonna...

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:24.979
Be back.

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.982
Nobody move.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.387
[door slams]

01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:35.323
alright, uh, we have to move.

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:37.892
Yeah. (laughs)

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.560
I'm gonna start taking down
the christmas decorations,

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.028
you guys should get that food
in the fridge.

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:44.198
Well, if the problem
is transportation,

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:46.200
maybe we could combine
our resources.

01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:49.904
So, meg's staying.
That's...

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:52.707
I don't know. Is she?

01:16:52.742 --> 01:16:55.076
Meg makes decisions faster than
any person I've ever met.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.611
Says the guy who just
changed jobs

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:58.179
in the blink of an eye.

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:00.448
What is this
that you're doing?

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:02.583
And you would have room
for all of us?

01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:04.218
Great!

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:06.687
Joe: Okay.

01:17:06.723 --> 01:17:09.724
You have told me
to put myself out there.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:12.693
Over and over and over.

01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:13.594
You're embarrassing
about it honestly.

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:14.595
But this is different.

01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:15.763
No, it's not.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.032
It's the same.

01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:19.634
Maybe things are moving
a little fast,

01:17:19.702 --> 01:17:21.369
but that's just how
these things go.

01:17:21.404 --> 01:17:23.104
If you miss this chance,

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.038
you might not get
another one.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:27.575
Yeah.

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:31.145

01:17:31.214 --> 01:17:32.413
everything up!

01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:33.247
The party's back on!

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.886
[meg laughs]
-alright.

01:17:41.457 --> 01:17:43.157
Meg: Hi!

01:17:43.226 --> 01:17:45.126
You can start setting up
over here.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:46.494
Yeah, we can't use
the whole space.

01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:48.295
Yeah, we had to leave room

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.764
for the other restaurants
in the contest.

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:51.599
Joe: She combined forces
so people

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:53.334
can walk here so no matter
how bad the roads are,

01:17:53.403 --> 01:17:54.568
or if they can't be driveable--

01:17:54.604 --> 01:17:56.937
one party, everybody is welcome.

01:17:56.973 --> 01:17:59.640
Not an invite list,
not a magazine

01:17:59.676 --> 01:18:02.076
with a mysteriously
judgmental editorial board.

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:03.577
Anyone who can get here safely

01:18:03.613 --> 01:18:05.479
is welcome.

01:18:05.515 --> 01:18:07.481
[festive music plays]

01:18:07.517 --> 01:18:08.082
[camera shutter clicks]

01:18:18.528 --> 01:18:19.660
this looks amazing!

01:18:19.696 --> 01:18:21.429
[meg screams]

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:23.030
you guys! How are you here?
The roads--

01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:24.765
the roads were terrible.
Yes.

01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:26.534
But we are mountain folk,

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:27.802
and we know how to put chains
on the tires.

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:30.037
We would not have missed this.

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:32.373
It just took
a little bit longer.

01:18:32.442 --> 01:18:33.474
Mom, you hate driving
in the snow.

01:18:33.509 --> 01:18:34.842
That was brave!

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:37.211
Brave? That?

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.281
You girls keep doing things
that inspire you.

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:42.049
And those things always seem
to help other people.

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:43.851
That, my darlings,
is bravery.

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:46.387
-Hi.
-Hi! (squealing)

01:18:46.456 --> 01:18:48.622
-hi!
-Come on in!

01:18:48.658 --> 01:18:51.992
So good to see you!

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:52.827
â™ª bring in that
holiday love â™ª

01:18:52.862 --> 01:18:54.195
[camera shutter clicks]

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.363
â™ª I've got that feeling

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.466
â™ª I want to give
from the heart â™ª

01:18:58.501 --> 01:18:59.633
thanks, meg.

01:18:59.669 --> 01:19:01.635
Oh, maryanne.

01:19:01.671 --> 01:19:02.837
I really wish we'd won you
that contest money.

01:19:02.872 --> 01:19:04.872
I'm sorry.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:06.907
Well, we'll get there
one way or another.

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:08.042
And jennifer, I hope
you don't mind

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.543
that I hired joe to manage

01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:11.245
the food bank. He's perfect.

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:12.379
As I assume you already know.

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:14.648
He is perfect,

01:19:14.684 --> 01:19:15.683
and I'm so thrilled
for you both really.

01:19:15.718 --> 01:19:16.917
And now I get my sister.

01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:18.586
Also perfect!

01:19:18.654 --> 01:19:21.021
Oh...Will you

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:21.989
just excuse me for one second.

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:22.823
Sure.

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:28.362
You're here.

01:19:28.397 --> 01:19:30.698
Dad called again, and
I gave it some thought,

01:19:30.733 --> 01:19:32.399
and this time,
I called him back.

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:33.834
And he invited me here.

01:19:36.773 --> 01:19:38.005
Nina.

01:19:43.346 --> 01:19:45.846
I'm just...Thank you.

01:19:45.882 --> 01:19:47.848
No. It's christmas

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.617
you know, and it's better
with family.

01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:51.952
And I've missed you.

01:19:52.021 --> 01:19:52.920
Dad.

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:03.531
[microphone squeals]

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:05.032
hello, everyone.
Everyone? (giggles)

01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:08.302
merry christmas.

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:10.704
On behalf of
the big mountain food bank

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:13.274
and the other charities
represented here today,

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.875
I'd like to thank
these three

01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:16.877
amazing restaurants

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:18.579
for putting this party on

01:20:18.614 --> 01:20:20.948
and all of you
for braving the snow.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:22.216
[cheers and applause]

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:29.890
and now, a new friend
of the food bank

01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:30.257
would like to say
a little something.

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:35.329
Hello, everyone.

01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:38.966
This christmas,

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:40.568
thanks to the attention
and care of everyone,

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:42.136
at umber and sprig,

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:45.072
well, I'm not alone.

01:20:45.107 --> 01:20:50.678
I'm here with friends and...
I have my daughter nina.

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:52.947
And in honor of that kindness,

01:20:52.982 --> 01:20:54.949
I'm committing to fund
whatever it costs

01:20:54.984 --> 01:20:57.818
to turn the big mountain
food bank

01:20:57.854 --> 01:20:59.186
into the store
they want it to be.

a place for people
with food insecurity

01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:12.166
can get whatever they need.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.267

01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:17.504
and I want to dance
with whomever asks.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.807

Hi!
Wanna take a photo with me?

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:44.465
It is your favorite thing.
