Do you love her?

I know you do.

It's 5 kgs of cocaine.

I'm giving it to you.

Oh, but it fucking belongs to me.

Because I have something
that belongs to you.

You have 12 fucking hours.

CROSSING POINT

Nice. Nice

 Trey.
 I'm on vacation.

We're smuggling drugs in Mexico.

No, I wouldn't call it "smuggling".

What do you think the cops
are gonna call it down here, huh?

 I don't know. "Gringo ??."? I don't know.
 You're a fucking idiot.

Well, we made it through,
so I suggest we smoke it.

 Of course you do.
 Relax Michael.

It's Mexico, not Switzerland.

What do we have here?

Another gringo.

Well, detonated.

I do not know why keep coming here.

 What do we have?
 Nothing.

Nothing?
Nothing.

I was not with the wallet?
Not Identity or mobile.

Check digital and dental records.
Try to identify him.

I will ask Hector to search for missing persons.
Yes.

He did not come alone.
No.

Tony.

How are your children?
Very well.

And wife?
Let's taking.

Hey, aren't you going to surf?

The waves are too big for you, today?

Oh, my God.

Michael!

Let me go!

Let me go!

This is the place. Be ready.

Let's move.

Watch out.

And now?

We wait.

She's so fucking hot!

Are you sure
about this girl, honestly?

If she says "yes",
I'm gonna settle down with this one.

What?

No way.

After just six months?

Micheal, are you...
You're kidding, right?

So I guess you are not coming
to the club tonight.

There you go.

Ready? Come on.

Are you ready?
Affirmative.

Roger that. Let's move.

Door!

Tony!?
Keep 'em busy!

Tony, are you there?
Move!

Tony!?

Damn it! Call reinforcement.
Copy that.

Come on, let's go!

What's the situation?
Tony and the others died.

You look beautiful.

Thank you.

I told you this place is amazing.

Surreal, almost.
Not a lot of people around, huh?

You see those luxury hotels?

Unfinished.

Yeah, they overbuilt.

Pay-time.

Well, just when their economy crashed,
the president declared war on drugs.

The media blew it out of proportions,
tourists got scared.

They stopped building.

I wanna meet your family.

Can I?

Please.

Sure. Let's do it.

Just let me get me bag from the room.

I'll see you in the lobby.

Do you really think that?
Fuck, no, man.

?? for the night, bro.

Here!

Hello, sir.
Come on.

Uh, what do you call the ??

Excuse me.

Hi.

Did you, by any chance, see a young woman?
She is wearing a pink dress.

She's about 5'7".

No, sir. I'm sorry. I didn't see.

Alright. Thanks.
You're welcome.

Hello?

Go to the hotel entrance.
You have two minutes. Come alone.

Get in! Come on!

Come on!

Oh, yeah!

I love you! I love you!

Paulina.

We lost.

You're gonna deliver it
across the border to San Diego.

If it's lost, stolen
or you get arrested, she'll die.

If it's damaged in any way,
she'll die.

It is there.

Thank you.

If you try to go back to your hotel
or contact the police, I'll know.

Because I'll be watching you,

And I your fucking throat myself.

Destination?
Tijuana.

Sign here, please.

Good morning, our last stop
will be in the central area.

The day is very hot,
keep the windows open, please. Thank you.

Valence.
We can we see mais tarde?

By noon.

Can Be.
Come alone. I'm working.

Are you okay?

You don't look good.
I am fine.

Wait.

Your eye is bleeding.

Can I?

Excuse me, sir.
Can I clean your boots?

For 20 pesos, you've the shiny new.
It's okay.

Is that the best you can do?

Look who is talking.

Look at you. You look like a mouse.
You smell like one.

Hey, I'm sorry about your partner.

Who told you that?

The street have ears.

Something bad happened?

Tell me, what were you doing in Baja?

I just came down for my friend's surf.

What?

I live a mile from the beach and never go.

Maybe I should.

Yeah, you should.

What do you know about the gringos
found dead at the border?

The gringos are not my problem.

Maybe, they came looking for a problem
and they found it.

Or maybe they put where they should not.

Perhaps.

But I think it has something to do with drugs.

They found something?
There were drugs in the blood?

No. I seemed to do this,
but there are coincidences that can not be ignored.

People are taken.

They get one and force the other
to cross drugs.

They can not cross themselves?

Because it is stolen.

Or a broken cartel controls the entire north.

How many dead?

Many.

We arrived in the central area.

Thank you for traveling
on the green bus.

Thanks. For cleaning me out.
Tenham a great day.

Hey! Stop that girl!

She stole my backpack.

I want it back.

Kill him.

Come on!

Finish him.

Fuck him, fuck him off.

Come on! Come on!

Yeah!
Yeah, yeah!

Come on! Come on!

Yeah!

Hey, wait a minute.

Release the dogs.

Enough!
Shut up, Lucy!

Bring him up!

That was one hell of a move
you pulled down there.

But if you were me,
I would have let the train blow you.

It'd cut you right in half.

This does not belong to you.

Cartel often wrap their dope
in a specific manner.

It's like a signature.

For example,

The Venegas Cartel
wraps their dopes like a cocoon.

La Sombra wraps their dope crisscrossed.

This is crisscrossed. Unbroken seal.

Anyone of us try to move this dope...

It could start a war...

or be a death sentence.

What makes it less than worthless to me.

In fact, it is a liability.

I do not care who blocks you.

I have to take it across the border.
American bandit.

Carrying a dope in Mexico?
You've to be willing to die.

Are you willing to die?

Yes.

And how did you plan
on carrying this across the border?

I'm American. I'll just walk.
Or I'll buy my way across.

Why is the Americans' answer to everything is money?

Listen.

I appreciate what you did for my niece.

I really do.

But you're going to have to leave. Now!

This...

It puts us all at risk.

It's all yours.

Just in case you need a plan B...

Here.

Mermaids. They are going to tell the guardsmen
that you need to see Pedro.

Anybody ask you who sent you,
you tell them with a straight face:

"None of your damn business!"

Understood?
Okay.

You pull this, they'll understand.
Why are you helping me out of this?

Because saved my niece here.

Even after she tried to jack you.
That takes heart.

Do you know how to use it?

You take this part,
you slam it on someone's face.

Then all you have to do is point.

If travel with drugs in Mexico,
you're going to need this.

Thanks.

The border is that way.

Just look for the metal arc RevoluciÃ³n.

Gringo.

Be careful.

Take it easy.

What you want?

Michael? Olivia!? Hello!

It is better to ask someone to open the door.
There's a guy at back in the hall.

But you can leave a message.
I'll call you back.

Dude, when you get this give me a call.

Great.
Please.

Michael? Olivia?

Try it again, dude.

Hi, this is Michael.
I'm not here right now.

But you can leave a message.
I'll call you back.

This is voice-mail again.
Are you kidding me?

Okay.

Reception. Can I help you?
Yeah, Hi, uh...

I need some help.
We are actually looking for our friends.

Hector.

How much is a coyote these days?

About 10,000 or 15,000.

Why? Are you thinking of being one?

I do not blame you.

The NSA also tracks serves up $10,000?
Yes.

Do me a favor.

Bring me the list of names of all the Americans.

I need you to be more specific.

Men.

18 to 35.

In our region in the past 24 hours.

Uh, is there any suspicion of murder?

No. Homicide, maybe.

ACCESS RESTRICTED. ONLY WITH VALID PAPERWORK.

We need to look into your bag, ma'am.

Hello?
I see you're making progress.

The next time we speak,
you'll be on the other side.

Don't try anything stupid.
Hey, wait. I wanna talk to her.

I need to know if she's okay.

Hello?

APARTMENT FOR RENT

You're looking for something to steal?

I thought of going through drugs,

but I guessed you have that over already.

Get in. I'll take you to plan B.

Come on.

Are you sure you wanna ride with me
and these drugs?

I'm not planning
on getting caught, are you?

I'm sorry trying to steal your bag.

You were an easy mark.

Not, really. Thank you
for pulling me off the track.

I owe you my life.

What's the deal with this guy, Pedro?

He's a coyote.

He will help you to get across
but I don't trust him.

Why not?

You have money?

Not much.
You need money.

A good coyote is expensive.

Do you want me to come with you?
No. I got this.

But thank you.

I still owe you.

We're even.

How can I help you?

I need to see Pedro.

Who sent you?

None of your fucking business!

AndrÃ©s, huh? Get in there.

I'm here to see Pedro.

Go do something.

A gun?

I think you might sit down yourself. Sit down.

Andres is who gave you this pistol or you are so bad-ass motherfucker you took it from him.

I guess the former?
He said you could help me.

I need to get across the border.
Hey, I thought white boys cross the border legally.

It must have something to do with this bag, right?

I have to get across the border cross.
Are you gonna help me or not?

So ,what are you gonna do?
Hop the fence like a goddamn ???

Hey, you need a pro to take you, okay?

It is an hour's drive to the East
over the roughest terrain Mexico has to offer.

You'll be dodging criminals,
out-laws, dirty cops, federals,

not to mention the cartel,
whose land will be trespassed on.

Listen to this:
you do not know where to cross.

I don't give a shit
what's in the bag. Right?

Kinda give a shit
but listen to me and notice,

you screw the wrong motherfucker
down here,

they'll cut your face off
and preach on a soccer ball.

I'm that "wrong motherfucker".

Did you understand what I said?

Yeah?

Okay, when to cross?
As soon as possible.

Hours or days?
Hours.

How much money do you got?

About $500.

$500?

$500!!?

You are joking with me, right?
You need $10,000!

Now, there is a problem 'cause of this.

You take your ass up ??
right now, okay?

Go to the bank, get the money.

Don't forget the money.
Bring your ass here as fast as you can,

will return to the US until the late afternoon.

Deal?
Okay.

Are you forgetting something?
Leave the bag.

Oh, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna need my passport.

It's not what you're gonna need.
I'm gonna tell you what you gonna need, okay?

You're not gonna need this fucking bag.
The bag is collateral. Alright?

It's safer here with me.

You get it?
Take your passport.

Get out of here.

Get the fuck out, man.

Rosy, cheer us out here.

Will you cash all of these? Okay?
Okay.

Start with this one.
Max out what you can.

Mr. Taylor, is everything alright?
Pardon.

Do you mind to take off
your hat and glasses?

I wonder if this is some sort of emergency?

No. No emergency.
Just a rough night.

As you understand the interest
and fees on cashing are very high.

Perhaps, I could arrange
a wire-transfer from another source.

No. No, that's fine.

Just give me the money, please.
I'm in a hurry.

On cash withdrawals
of more than $10.000...

we'll need you to fill out some forms.
Yeah. It's fine.

Come with me, please.

TORPEDO MOVING

What do you think of them?

Who? The pudgy?

Look at them.
They barely fit in the elevator, imagine the tunnel.

Just a thought.

Hey, baby.
He is on his way.

He is paying for the coyote.

I want more this time.

You okay where we agreed.

Mateo.

I want more.

Hey. Hey, relax scared man.

Come on, this is... You don't know
the treat, man? It's for the business.

Alright? Be cool. There.

Hey! My fucking money?
You got the money?

Good.

Hey, you know what?
You can tell my probation officer...

I'm going to Mexico?
I will miss on Wednesday at 15h.

Hey, boss!
I think I found something.

What did you find?

Michael Taylor.

Hello?

Have you heard anything?

Okay. We'll... We'll be up here.

Come on up.

Thank you.

Wars and conflicts.

They do not come from your desires that...

American?
Yeah.

Uh, my name is Gabriel.
I am from Nicaragua.

You know Nicaragua?
I do.

May I ask you a question?
Sure.

What are you doing here?

Just trying to get across.

Same as you.
Uh, huh, no. "Same as you"?

Well, you're not same as me.

You are American.
You're going home.

I don't want any trouble.

I'm just trying to get across.

Perhaps, we're same.

Or they think Scripture
says in vain:

He jealously desires the Spirit
who lives in us.

However, it gives us the greatest grace.
So I said, God resists the proud...

Hi, gentlemen.
Hello.

Do you recognize this person?

Yeah, that's him.
Yeah. It is Michael Taylor.

Excuse me.

Hi, Jesus.

Yes, that's him. I will send friends home.
Very good.

Do they know
why he drew the money in Tijuana?

They do not know.

They do not know.

We discover something about Olivia.

Olivia?
Olivia Duran, his girlfriend.

She is Mexican?
Yes.

We investigate,
but found nothing.

No address, no phone.

Her mother died in childbirth in Tijuana.

We don't know much
about her father.

We know that she entered
several times in the USA.

We are checking.

Tell his friends
that everything will be fine.

Good job.

Submit to God.

Resist the devil
and he will flee from you.

How much longer?
Not long, Michael.

Cleanse your hands, sinners.

How do you know my name?

Gringo!

FIRST CHURCH OF MEXICO

Brothers, do not speak ill
of each other.

He who speaks evil
of a brother...

If you judge the truth,
then it does not meet...

...it is able to save
and to destroy.

Is that you? Who are you?

Please, please!

Don't... Don't hurt me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

They were going to kill me.

Let's go.

What you want? Huh?

I want to talk to Pedro
to see what happened to the American.

The American? Why?

I just want to know if he went through.

It's okay.

I'll call.

Thanks.

ALSO ON THIS SIDE THERE DREAMS

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Good luck.

This is crisscrossed.
Unbroken seal.

Hey. My fucking money?
You get the money?

Hey, you know what?
You can tell my probation officer...

I'm going to Mexico?

Pedro.

I think we got
a rabbit on the run here, huh?

I'm American.
We will see about that.

On your knees, boy. Now.

Easy now.

I'm reaching for my passport.
Okay.

What do you think?

Okay. Get up.

What are you doing out here, boy?
It's a long story.

How about making it a short one?

What happened to your face?
He took a beat up there?

What's in the bag?

I asked you what's in the bag.
It's my belongings.

Show Us.

This is America. You have no right...
Show us what's in the bag!

Now!

Thank you.

Open.

You. On the ground, now!

The passport. Throw it to me.

Now, cuff yourself to him.

You should be ashamed.

Throw me the keys.
No!.

Really?

Hey! Where are you going? Hey!

What do you think you're doing?

Hey!

He was just at the border, man.

Now it looks like he's turning around.
What's going on?

Look, your fucking boyfriend
is getting ?.

I thought he was being followed.
Or maybe his backpack was stolen, man.

Hey, you're still paying me!
I did my part.

Mateo.

Anytime you fucking go back
to where I found you.

He could have been jumped.

Is there a problem, my friend?

No. I'm on schedule.
If you don't make delivery,

she's not the only one that's gonna die,
do you understand me?

You've less than three fucking hours.

I'm looking for an American,
Michael Taylor.

He drew $12,000 from a local bank
to pay a coyote.

We believe that he
is being forced to be mule...

with drugs stolen from a cartel.

Do not be afraid of retaliation.

We find this  American, and the supplier,
we will do a favor to the cartels.

These are the most common points of crossing.

If he came to one of them,
it is too late.

You switched it, you son of a bitch.
Hey, relax. Just put the gun down.

And you tried to have your men kill me!
Put the gun down.

I'm not going out like that.
Okay. It's cool

What you want from me?
I want it back!

Hey, fuck you.
I can't do this, alright?

Okay. Okay.

Alright. It's up here.

Alright.
Just don't shoot me, alright?

I like my head.
I don't wanna lose it.

Hey, look. Look.
This isn't yours.

It's not yours. It's not, okay?

They will want back and will want to know...

They will want to know who gave you this.

So they are fucking gonna kill me.

And they're definitely gonna kill you!

Hey, look. Look, smart-ass.

You tell me yourself.

I told you I didn't trust him.
Good call.

My uncle called Pedro
and sniffed out his bullshit.

He's going to get the sewers ?.

AndrÃ©s protected you.

We don't take that lightly around here.

Are you gonna come clean now?

They kidnapped my girlfriend.

And told me to take these drugs
across the border.

An hour left before they kill her.

Well, how's that funny?
I wish someone ?.

Listen, I'm running out of time.

We're gonna take the tunnel.
It's simple as that.

Valencia.
Jesus. It is the terminal 4.

I believe that the American
has just appeared.

Follow me.

This way.

This way.

It's gonna be okay.
You'll get her back.

Where is it?
You are standing on it.

You're on your own from here.
Thanks.

Now we're even.

You need to go, Michael.
Go! Now go!

Move! Please, go, Michael!

Go, go, go, go.

Baby, it's all coming together.

Cheers.
Cheers

Mateo.

The kid is in US soil, man.
We need to get our people in place now.

Are you sure you can't give me
something extra this time?

Don't worry. I'll make you.

Michael Taylor,
I've been looking for you.

Jesus Valencia, Tijuana Police.

I know they have Olivia.

You know who's got her?
We're close.

If we're together,
we can find them.

No, if I talk to the police,
they'll kill her.

Can I help you, Michael.
I can't take her chance. I'm sorry.

You do this on your own,
neither one of you will survive.

This guy don't like loose ends.

You help me find them...

I'll let you walk.

Give me the gun.

I don't have much time.

You don't need much time.

We set a sting op on our side,

Mr. Valencia has Mateo's residence in Tijuana.

He's telling the truth. He say when you're
the US side of the border near the crossing...

Don't give him a chance to ask you questions.
You ask him about Olivia.

Say, she is still alive?
Say, you wanna speak to her.

Probably, he'll refuse, but it's okay.

When he tells you where to make the drop,
you keep it nice and slow.

If he says you need 30 minutes,
you say you need 45.

You gotta buy us as much time
as you can, Michael.

Do not know.
They're tracking the phone, I think.

He is. But don't worry,
this place does not exist.

Hey, kid, come on. Hey.
Keep it together.

Hang in there.
Just a bit long, okay?

We do this every day.

You're gonna be okay.

We've an incoming.

Fucking idiot.

So, backtrack this number to an address in Tijuana.

It is registered to a Mateo Fuentes.
And guess what?

He's on our watch-list.

Is that him?

Just give me another minute to trace.

Hello?

You made it?
I did.

Where the fuck are you?
San Isidro.

Very good friend.

You got my shit?
I have it.

Okay.

What about Olivia?
I wanna talk to her.

You can talk to her after.
It's what we agreed.

Tell me what to do.

Go to Chicano Park,
look for a lady, Guadalupe.

There will be a bin with a red X.

Make the fucking drop inside
and get the hell out of there.

When do I get to see her?

After we verify the product.

I need more time.

I'm on foot.
Take a damn taxi.

You have 30 minutes
or she is dead.

I got him.
Okay, time to go.

I'll ? the trace.
We're all clear, Jesus.

We're going to get this guy.
We're going to bring back Olivia unharmed.

I'm going with you.

The drop will be made
â€‹â€‹in 30 minutes or less.

Make sure you check the fucking bag
before you get out.

As soon as the drop is made,
kill him.

Hey, Mateo.

He just dropped the bag bag, but...
But what?

He's just standing there.
He's not fucking leaving.

Get my shit
and slice his fucking throat.

What? Right here?
What the fuck did I just tell you?

Just fucking do it!

Just fucking do it, man.

We got movement.

Wait for my call.

Hey, white boy!

Freeze! Freeze!
Hands on the floor. Now! Now!

On your knees! Now!

Hands! Hands!
Hands on the floor. Now!

Copy!

Hey, something is fucking wrong, man.

What the hell!
Where the fuck is my shit!?

Boom!

Move!

Let's go! Let's go!

What the fuck...

Stop right there!

You fucking bitch!

It's okay.

It's over, man.

Michael!

You're safe now.

Michael, I wanna go home.

Michael.

So, you just took?
Yeah.

It's mine.

The guy tried to kill me, so I figure
he at least owe me that much.

My hero.

Hello?
Michael, this is Jesus, Tijuana Police.

We found a copy of Mateo's phone logs
and found his connection to you.

It's Olivia Duran.

We're tracking your phone.
We're on our way to you.

If you're with her,
you are in danger, Micheal.

You understand me?

No, that's great!

We're actually just on our way
to meet her family.

I'll call you later.

Okay.

Who were you talking to?
Just the guys. Checking up on us.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

I'm just gonna go the bathroom
and I'll be right back.

They still have to chose you
for a reason.

This was "Between War and Love".

One of my favorite.
Let's continue.

Michael?

I can smell it.

I know you're back here.

You know, I have to tell you.

I've done this before.

And you made it more interesting
than any of them.

But you had to mess it up,
didn't you?

Why couldn't you do
what your were asked?

You cost me Michael.

And now what?
You're gonna turn me in?

Not gonna happen.

If you needed money,
you could have asked.

I would have done anything for you.

Men just wanna use me
for my body. That's it.

And you're no different.

So, you wanna
do something for me now?

Well, you can.
You can burn.

Michael, what are you doing?

You are insane?

Micheal, you don't have to do this.

You always have a choice.

Michael, help me!

Come here, Micheal!
Help me!

Michael, help me!

Hopefully! Hopefully!

Michael, what happened?

Where's Olivia?

Be careful.

I've secured her in the back.
She is covered in gasoline.

She's a lighter.

She killed the clerk.

She's back there. Go!

Thank you.

You saved me twice.
I was just doing my job.

Michael, there's something for you
in the glove compartment.

Good luck.

Dropping the gun, cowboy?

Something like that.

This is why
you came all the way here?
