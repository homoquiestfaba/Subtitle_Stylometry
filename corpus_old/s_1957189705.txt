[male #1]
Son of a fucking dog, man.

People losing their
fingers right and left.

Methylene Chloride stinking
up the god damn place.

Lousy coffee.

You're only 20 minutes
late and they dock you.

You gotta bring your
own coffee, man.

Oh.

Hey, man,
nice scooter.

Thanks.

What year is it
anyway, man, a '56?

It's got a lot of mismatched
stuff but it's a '57 basically.

So you work here, huh?

No, I've just been visiting
the place everyday

for the last six years.

Ooh, glutton for
punishment or what?

Pays the bills.

Oh, listen man, I'm sorry.

I-I didn't mean anything
by it, really.

Just kinda had a fucked
up first day.

Don't worry about it.

Joe Mosely.

Dave Coleman, hiya.

It's really a cherry bike.

'You do all the
work yourself?'

All but the machining.

Kind of inherited
it from my old man.

Yeah? I don't have
any family left.

They were all killed
in a car wreck.

Oh, shit.
'Yeah.'

That's why I ride a bike.


So, uh, what do you do for
fun around here, anyway?

<i>[John Doe singing

â™ª Grass smokes stashed up â™ª

â™ª Up in the sky â™ª

â™ª I work this job
until the day I die â™ª

â™ª Never had kids,
lost my wife â™ª

â™ª All I got left is
this damn motorcycle â™ª

â™ª Why can't people
get together? â™ª

â™ª My heart's a bloody mess,
but my head light as a feather â™ª

â™ª Gas or beer they don't know,
now or never â™ª

â™ª Beer, gas, ride forever â™ª

â™ª One dark hill

â™ª The night crawls over

â™ª If I knew what I'd lost
I might be able to find it â™ª

â™ª Someone said something

â™ª Get behind it â™ª

'Hey, if you like this place'

'I gotta take you
to this place I know.'

Got the most beautiful women
in the world, right?

And it's got a casino.
It's in Nevada.

You know, getting lucky is the
most perfect way to get rich.

Hey, you don't got
to fuck anyone over.

You and me, we ought to ride
out and hit the old jackpot.

El Dorado, dude.

Yeah, right. I got three
weeks to six day shifts.

Listen, this place, it's
called the Three Queens..

No, Four Kings, Two Jacks,
something like that.

It-it, this real nice
family runs it, right?

And they make you feel all
safe and happy and warm..

...and lucky.

Hey, you want a beer?
Absolutely.

I'll be over there.

Let me get two buds.

'Monkeys attack, prepare
to meet your doom clown.'

[male #2]
Here you go, sweetheart.

Come on, you little monkey.
Whoa, watch out for the medfly.

'Fly like a scud, come on.'

Here's your change.

Yeah. Yes, yes.

[short circuiting]

Oh!

Ah!


Dave?

[male #3]
'I told Louis, those
circuits were overloaded.'


Dave.

[soft music]

Shit.


[telephone ringing]

Hold on.
'Hi, is it Joe?'

'May I speak to
Joe Mosely, please?'

'Joe, are you there?'

'What's going on?
Joe, Joe'

'Joe, can you hear me?'

'I think we have
a bad connection.'

'What's happening?
What are you doing?'

Yeah.
'Hi, Joe. It's Angie Abbot.'

Angie, who?
'Angie Abbot from the plant.'

Oh, yeah. You're working
with personnel, right?

'Is this a bad time to call?
Some kind of..'

No, it's not a bad time to call.

'Well, you sound
kind of weird.'

No, there's just
some idiot that

I thought was gonna
jump off the roof.

'I heard about that guy that got
electrocuted and everything.'

'I thought, maybe you'd
want some good news.'

I could use some good news.

'I do the data entry
for benefits and stuff.'

Uh-huh.

'I can get that guy processed
as an accidental death'

'on the shop floor.'

What's so great about that?

'Well, didn't you fork out a
bunch of money for his funeral?'

Yeah, the cremation and shit
cost about 300 bucks.

'See, if you want, I can do
this thing on the computer'

'so that you can
get reimbursed.'

'Alright, yeah, great.'

'You don't sound very happy
or grateful or anything.'

'If I were you, I'd be hugging
and kissing me right now.'

'I mean, you just can't
go around paying'

'for stranger's funerals
everyday of the week.'

Yeah, I know, I know
I can't go around paying

for stranger's
funerals every day.

'You barely even knew him.'
He seemed like a cool guy.

And you know that if
no one claims the body

then he gets stuck
in some refrigerator

'Ew.'

Then he gets just shoved
in with a bunch of John Does'.

'Why didn't you call his family?
They live in St. Marina.'

What?
'Yeah.'

'Their address and number
are on the computer.'

'Said he didn't have family.'
'Well, he does.'

'You should call them.'
'Well, shit. I'll call 'em.'

'What are they gonna say when I
tell them I cremated their son?'

[doorbell ringing]

Uh, hi. I'm Joe, I called
Mrs. Coleman earlier about Dave.

Yes.

Look, I didn't
know him that well

but he'd seem like
a real nice guy.

Right, thank you.

Um, he had a last
wish before he died.

Sorry?

He said he wanted
to ride out to Nevada.

Some place called,
El Dorado or something.

And I thought,
well, you could..

Fine, thank you.

...do something.

Thank you.

Good evening, my name
is Mr. Andrews.

And welcome to the
Barstow, Motel 9.

How you doing, Andy?

Mr. Andrews.
'Whatever.'

Got a single for the night?
Certainly, fill this out.

I'll need to see your
major credit card, please?

I don't have
a major credit card.

I'll need to see two
pieces of identification

and the registration
for your vehicle.

What's-what's that?

Five gallon, fat bug.

Keep it inside this.

We don't want any grease
spots on the furniture.

Do we?

No, we don't
want that Andy.

Mr. Andrews.

I'll just keep this
to ensure against damages.

Putting you in room 236.

Go around the back and up
the stairs, to your left.

Don't you have anything
on the first floor?

I'm sorry, Mr. Mosely.

We have a policy
of distributing our guests

'evenly throughout
the facility.'

And we already have someone
registered on the first floor.

Well, I'd like to keep
an eye on my bike.

I'm sorry, Mr. Mosely.

Can't deviate from policy.

Look, if I go to bed right now
and check out before dawn

then no one will know that you
let me slide on the rules.

I didn't get to be
a management trainee

by breaking rules, Mr. Mosely.

I have ethics.

Ethics instilled in me
by a healthy fear of God.

Have a great night, Andy.

[woman on TV]
'Here's a re-enactment.'

[man on TV]
'Fred Nieman, a postal employee
in Shipsburgh, Alabama.'

'Went on a rampage today.'

'Planting letter bombs
in the mail boxes'

of all the homes on his route
which received correspondent

from Planned Parenthood
of America.

Right before detonating a bomb
in his own carrier bag.

Mr. Nieman proclaimed,
"Long live the unborn."


[male #4]
'Ah.'



Ah.

What the fuck are you doing?

Nothing.

And you have the nerve
to call this a Motel 9?

There's no wrapping on one
of my drinking glasses.

'There's no bath
soap in my room.'

But, I...

Don't gimme some excuse like
there's two bars of hand soap.

'Cause there's supposed
to be one of each

not two of one,
god damn it..

Were your accommodations
alright, Sir?

Huh? Oh, yeah, fine.

What do I owe you?

'$21.95.'

Can I get my license
and stuff back?

Pardon me?

Over there, my pink slip,
license, union card.

The guy last night,
took 'em from me.

Why?

Why, um..?

I think 'cause
he was an asshole.


Is there a map of Nevada
over there?


Do you have a map of Nevada?

I'm terribly sorry, Sir.

We used to have them.
But we ran out.

But I believe they're on order.

And I-I think they'll be
in sometime this month.

Forget it.

You know, I'm something
of a gazetteer

when it comes to
the Great Basin.

Perhaps, I could help.
What the hell is a gazetteer?

A geographical dictionary.

Oh, really?

You know where El Dorado is?

No.

Great.

Well, it's only a hobby.

Oh, he forgot his change.

Hey, I'll give him the change.
I'll give him the change.

I'll give it right to him.

Hey, I got your
nickel back for you.

My name is Sam.

Joe.

That's your bike?

Yeah.

Pretty fucking cool, huh?

It's a Harley Davidson, huh?

Yeah.

It's-it's classic?

Yeah, it could be.

Does it run good?

Yeah.
'Alright.'

Hey. uh..

What were you doing?
What?

Never mind.

Bye, Joe.

[instrumental music]

[telephone ringing]

<i>[Angie]
First mail.</i>

<i>Hi, this is Joe Mosely.
Can you check...</i>

<i>- Hi, Joe.
Who's this?</i>

<i>Angie.</i>

<i>Oh, hi, I need to take
a couple of sick days.</i>

<i>What's wrong?</i>

<i>Well, nothin' really.</i>

<i>I just need some
time off so I can...</i>

<i>Oh, Joe. You don't have any more sick days left.</i>

<i>Damn.</i>

<i>Want me to add on some for you?</i>

<i>- How can you do that?
On the computer.</i>

<i>Oh, really?</i>

<i>That-that'd be great.</i>

<i>Joe, I was thinking that when you go back</i>

<i>maybe we could do something together.</i>

<i>You mean like a date?</i>

<i>You know, it's kind of risky for me</i>

<i>to be doing this computer thing.</i>

<i>- Yeah, but, um... - So, what about Friday night?</i>

<i>Friday?</i>

<i>Uh, yeah, I guess
I'll be back by then.</i>

Morning.

Can I get a draught?
Sure.

'Where you headed?'

Nevada, some place
called El Dorado.

You know where's it's at?
Nevada?

You know, I had a great run
up in Nevada one time.

Must have been '61, '62.

'My buddy Nelson come out.'

'He had a DSA and I had
a, I had an Old Indian.'

Whoops, course that was
long before I got married.

Since then, I haven't
done much ridin'.

Hell, I ain't done
any ridin' at all.

I had an old lady.

She used to spit rocks every
time I'd go on a run.

Where's she now?
Gone.

But not forgotten.

Send her $600 a month alimony

for the last six years.

That's a lot of money.
I heard that.

You know, me and Nelson

we used to go up to
Pyramid Lake to go fishing.

Of course, I don't do it now.

'Cause I got this fish up there
called Cui-ui or something.

It's like a Indian name.

These Cui-uis' are
like prehistoric fish.

I'm not talking about the kind
of fish that's prehistoric

I'm talking about each one
individually, is prehistoric.

'That makes them old.'

And when they get old,
they get big.

And when they get big,
they get feet.

When they get feet,
they get dangerous.

Not only they can swim on water,
they can slide around the top.

'They could jump up in the air''

Hey, Joe, come on,
check out my new bike.

Joe, come on.

And you too.

1968, Triumph Bonneville 750.

All original parts.
Yeah, special.

Yeah, look at those hot pipes.

Pretty, hey, look.
Triumph Bonneville 750.

Yeah.

Boy, that's a classic.

Think so? It's pretty
fuckin' cool.

What do I owe you
for the beer?

No, forget it.
Just keep riding.

Alright.

You think I could
ride with you?

It's a free road.

See you.
Wait-wait up.

Wait.

[instrumental music]

I wasn't too sure
about this bike.

You know? I mean it looks
kind of fucked up.

It's not all sturdy like yours,
but it's tight man, it's tight.

Yay! That is great.

[engine sputtering]

God!

'Power, freedom.'

First bike I ever owned, man.
It is perfect.

Fuck!

Hey.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Why did you stop?

Is your bike busted?

No.

I got some tools.

Guy who sold me the bike threw
in some wrenches and stuff.

Look, I got wrenches.

Then what's wrong?

I need a ribbon.

Oh.

So, on your way
to El Dorado, huh?

Yeah, if I get there.

What's it to you anyway?

I don't know, I just..
We're out here. I figured.

You don't have
to hang around...

I'm not gonna leave you
in the middle of nowhere.

Are you followin' me?

You're not going anywhere.

Yeah, but first, you're on
the roof outside my apartment.

Then you're at
the same motel as me.

And now you show up
with this bike.

This bike was
a great deal, 500 bucks

and the guy threw in a set
of wrenches and this jacket

helmet and everything.

Oh, yeah, what about the motels?

I always stay at Motel 9,
I figured you were into 'em too.

Really.

Aright, look, I was
kind of following you.

I don't know much about bikes,
I figured you could help me out.

You know, if something
goes wrong.

It's kind of funny that yours
is the one that broke down.

Yeah.

Hey, could I get one?

'Can I smoke?'

Thanks.

Yeah, started smoking
when I was seven.

Never buy 'em though.

'When did you start?'

Pretty worried about
your bike, huh?

I'm worried about being
on the middle of a desert

with somebody who doesn't
have his own cigarettes.

Okay.

I'll just save it for later.

Ya, do that.

Hey.


Hey, it's gonna stop, Joe.

Lovely day.

A bit warm though to be sitting
in the middle of the desert.

I know, my friend broke down.
Maybe I can help.

Yeah, uh..

What do you need?
Eighth-inch rivet.

Yeah, he needs an
eighth-inch rivet.

Well, I got a lot of fixing
paraphernalia back in my place.

You got any beer?

I have some Cristal.
Wow, speed?

Champagne.
Oh.

Speed kills, or worse.

It makes you psychotic.

You got it?

People love it, because
it makes them feel

they're in control
of their destiny.

What you oughta be on a look out
for is transcendent reality.

Seeing in and seeing out.

Okay, push it up here.

'Okay.'

[both grunting]

Speed kills.

'You know where a place
called El Dorado is?'

[male #5]
'There's an El Dorado Canyon
up near Mt. Charleston.'

'Oh, great.'

'I'll ride back here
with the bike.'

See ya.

Forget it.

I'm not leaving you alone
with that guy, he's nuts.

I'm fine man.

I'm telling you,
the guy's insane.

Look, how slow he's driving.
Fucking crazy.

Just get lost, will you?

No way, I'll make sure
you're alright.

Joe, wait up.

'It's cool, that crazy guy knew
where El Dorado is, huh?'

'Yeah.'
'Mountain dew, alright.'

Man, I haven't had one of these
since I was like six years old.

I had this friend Corky.

And he used to drink
'em all the time.

'He said it improved
his burping.'

Anyway, he had this sister.

And every day, man,
she was such a bitch.

She'd come home after school
everyday and take his

afterschool snack.

A Marlboro box, please.
Okay.

Anyway, um, his snacks
were usually like, um..

waffles or something,
you know?

But, do you always
smoke Marlboros?

Yeah, can I get a pack
of Marlboro's, please?

Could I get two packs, hard
packs of Marlboro's, please?

On me.
Two pack?

You always smoke the hard pack?

'Cause I think you're
supposed to get

more tobacco from
the soft pack.

'Cause they cut 'em.

I mean, they make then shorter
so they can close the lid.

Of the hard pack, I mean.

You know, 'cause they're suppose
to fall out of the soft pack

a lot easier.

Do you want anything else?
Uh, no, thanks.

You sure?

We got chicken fried steak
on special today.

This is fine.
Okay.

[horn honking]

[police siren]

'What are you doing?'
'What's that?'

'Help. Ah, help me'

'What are you doing?'

You just stay right there boy,
don't you move it.

I didn't do anything.
Shit.

'Ah, help.'

You're hurting me,
I didn't do anything.

When was the last time
you passed through here?

I never been here before
my entire life.

Don't bullshit me.

Uh, maybe, I went to, uh,
I took a bus to see my

Grandma Mooney in Wisconsin.

Joe, help me.

Officer, let him off.
He's not hurting anyone.

Well, he could be.

He bears a sinister resemblance
to a vicious criminal

that's been around
in our area.

And since when is it a crime
to look like somebody?

'Yeah, what the guy do anyway?'

Unlawful re-pass and remove.

What?
Huh?

Dine and dash.

I'm gonna let you go with
a warning this time.

He didn't do anything.

[gun barrel clicking]

You don't realize what's
happening, do you?

'Cause if you did, you'd be
shitting in your shoes.

Wouldn't you be
quaking with fear?

I want you to look around,
just look around.

Tell me what you see?

A whole society that's obsessed
with feeling good and happy.

But underneath
that moronic veneer

lurks a thirst for blood.

Yes, my friend.

An invidious potential..

...lawlessness...and despair.

Existential and otherwise.

The sooner you weasels
open your eyes

to the hideous truth.

'The sooner you wish
you were dead.'

'That guy is insane.'
'Let's get outta here.'

Hey, how come you don't
wear a helmet?

Those are bullshit man.

[soft music]


[music continues]

Hey, your key, man.

Don't forget your key.

[bell ringing]

[speaking indistinctly]

Oh, man, you sure
wouldn't rather hit

a Burger King or something?

No, this place is cool.
Hey, hey, cool cats.

Just in time for
the platter party.

[snapping fingers]

Hi, I bet you're a wild one.
Uh, no.

They had a lot of places
like this in 50's?

Oh, yeah.

Everyday after nursery school
I just hop on my tricycle.

Goin' down to Muscle Beach

and have milk
and cookies with Elvis.

Cool.

[male #6]
'Bacon double cheese burger.'

'Coney Island Dog.'

Black cow.

Meatloaf sandwich.

Sprite.

'Tender omelet.'

Spaghetti dinner.

'A bowl of soup.'

French toast.

Monte Cristo baby.

Uh, chef salad, diet plate,
decaf coffee.

And a hot fudge sundae.

Hi, I'm Caspar.

What do you guys want?
'It's okay, man. We can...'

No, put their order on my tab.

My name is Sam.
He's Joe.

I'd like some French fries.

And a root beer float
and a-and a paddy malt.

That's al...alright.

Just coffee.

Well, that ain't enough
for no swashbuckler.

'Give the man a steak sandwich'

couple of eggs
and strawberry shake.

No, really, I...

You don't like strawberry,
I understand

I don't either.
Make it vanilla.

And bring out a chocolate one,
just in case.

'And an ice water.'

So, what do you guys do?

We ride.

Outlaws, huh?

Yeah.

What about you?

Me?

I'm Symbionese.

Cool.

Cool.

[bell ringing]

Here is the steak sandwich.

Here's your paddy malt
and fries..

'Come on.'

Wow.

Free food for the bar.

Thanks.

[female #1]
'What?'

'Oh my god.'

'Coward people.'

Stop that man.

Son of a bitch.

Monte Cristo you, baby.

[screaming and shouting]

Interesting guy, huh?

Uh-huh.

Listen.

Where does someone,
"Symbionese" come from?

I don't know, man.
Sounds Middle Eastern to me.

Must be cool.

How much further to El Dorado?

I think it's too far.

Let's stop in Vegas
for the night.

Cool, they got a Motel 9 there.

I'm sorry, I don't think..

This is bullshit, Lady.

Come on, I see this
commercial all day on TV.

We're never sorry..

[female #2]
'If you'd only made
a reservation.'

I'm a member of the, of the
Frequent Sleeper Club.

And we really appreciate
your loyalty.

Lady, can't you just
kick someone out?

Come on, please, can't...
Honey, honey, look.

Across the street I can see
they still have rooms.

You can't see anything.

Argh.

[engine idling]

Hey, it's a crazy
kinda evening tonight.

I hope everyone is with
the one they love.

I know, I am.

â™ª Spring time
and the city is..â™ª

'Hey, man. What is it
with you and Motel 9?'

These guys are kinda
funny, huh?

Where do you think they
get their suits from?

Hey, Sam.

How come you stay at
Motel 9's all the time?

Okay.

I'm a regional inspector
for the chain, you see?

I travel around to make sure
they're doing everything okay.

I mean, you have no idea
how many of these places

they fold the towels in half.

I mean, they're supposed
to be folded in thirds.

'And there's this
pillow problem.'

'Th-they're different
sized pillows.'

They-they put the-the sheet is
supposed to be all the way up.

Folded over and the pillows
are supposed to go on top.

'Whoa, whoa, whoa.'

If you know so much,
you're such a hot shot.

Why don't you just snap your
fingers and go command a room?

'Cause I'm working under cover.
I'm a spy for the head office.

â™ª What does it matter â™ª

In fact, I don't think
it's a bad idea

if I go across the street
and stake the place out.

Someone could be checking out
in the middle of the night.

[male #7]
'Goodnight, folks.'

See you.

[man #7]
Folks, your attention, please.
Live from Orlando.

'It's Ms. Labia Mirage.'

[instrumental music]

[crowd applauding]

[female #3]
'All you've got is yourself.'

And yourself is inside
your body.

And your body is your own.

That's cool.

It's really cool.

Boo.

'I thought you might me hungry''

Yum. Thanks, Kitty.

Why do you like sex?

I don't know.

Um.

'Cause it feels good.

Most of the time, I think,
people take it too seriously

like it's a consummate
and sacred.

I mean, the most
holy thing about it

is that it's human.

Yeah, but what about animals?

They just do it to breed.

Humans know about affection.

Does that mean we
should get a room?

Can we get the check?

Sure.

Thanks.

Hey.

You wanna come with
me to El Dorado?

The legendary city
with gold conquistador.

Yeah, I guess so.
Well, maybe some other time.

I gotta stick to my schedule.

Hey, hey, Sam.

Time to go.

This is Ms. Labia Mirage.

And she's dancin'
her way to the Yukon.

Time to get going.

You know what they say,
conquistador?

No, what?

Stick with the one who can
see the truth of your soul.

Don't take any wooden nickels.

Bye.

Bye.

[engine idling]

Hey, Mr. Motel 9.

How'd you like that
parking lot? Huh?

<i>[Joe] Angie, I'm not sure, I'm gonna be back on Friday night.</i>

<i>[Angie]
Really? Oh, darn. I told my
parents you're coming over.</i>

<i>- Your parents?
Yeah.</i>

<i>But they're home every night.
We can do it on a Saturday.</i>

<i>[Joe]
Well, I...</i>

<i>[Angie]
And Joe, my dad really likes
it when guys wear suits.</i>

<i>- But uh...
See you Saturday.</i>

Is this where we're goin'?

This is El Dorado,
doesn't it?

[guitar music]

This isn't it.

[birds chirping]

It says, "Eldorado Canyon".
Yeah, but it's not El Dorado.

What do you mean?

What do you mean,
what do I mean?

You see a casino?

You see any of the most
beautiful women in the world?

This is fucking great.

There's no fucking casino.

There's no goddamn women.

You trying to pick up a date
at a camp ground?

I should've known.

I should've fucking known.

I burned 200 bucks
on this goddamn trip.

I got no more sick leave left.

And there's some jailbait
computer scam artist

trying to blackmail me
to go out with her.

Goddamn it!

She probably didn't even do
what she said she was gonna do.

I can just kiss
my job goodbye.

[guitar music]

'You hear that?'
'What?'

â™ª I don't even know good bye â™ª

â™ª Come â™ª

â™ª Show me where â™ª

â™ª The water lies â™ª

â™ª I don't need
no preacher â™ª

â™ª To show me God â™ª

â™ª I can't see it â™ª

â™ª Shinin' in your eyes â™ª

â™ª I'm walkin' â™ª

â™ª Over the hill â™ª

â™ª I haven't got it
together yet â™ª

â™ª But before I'm over
the hill I will â™ª

â™ª Look in to see the light â™ª

â™ª Hopin' I can last all night â™ª

â™ª Hopin' that I live
to see the light â™ª

[inhaling rapidly]

Like to smoke?

Othello Jones.

Sam.

Joe.

That song, man.

It's beautiful.

You're too kind.

'Once upon time,
in Ancient Rome'

'there was
a band of gladiators.'

'Now, you know,
gladiators were all slaves.'

'But these particular gladiators
were Ethiopian Saints, as well''

'This was during the decline.'

It was about 1 AD
or so. AD.

'These gladiators refused
to perform their battles'

'for the ruling class.
Now, it didn't matter to 'em'

'that they would be
crucified or burned'

'or shot with slings
and arrows.'

They wouldn't die
for support.

They-they get killed
anyway though. Didn't they?

Well, everybody dies.

It's part of life.

But these gladiators

they don't waste
their deaths.

'And maybe,
because they were martyred'

'or maybe,
because they were right.'

Their convictions were passed
down through the ages.

'They could see the truth.'

'Touch souls.'

'So, how'd you like Vietnam?'

What?

You're, I would say,
37, 38 years old?

Yeah,
I didn't go.

Our lottery number
was 348.

You were lucky.

Yeah, maybe, so.

Definitely.

You-you got to stay here
and go to Woodstock

and everything.

Nixon years when
everybody's partying.

Nixon, he's-he's that guy

who's always
on the cover of Time.

No, man.
He was a President.

How am I supposed to know
all that history from the '60?

I wasn't even born
till 1970.

You start learning now.

George Reagan, he makes Nixon
look like a real decent guy.

That's George Bush.

Well, I, uh, I get 'em
kinda confused myself.

Hey, man, thanks, uh,
for these sleeping bags.

And the food.

It's nothin'.

Listen, would either of you guys
happen to have a Roman candle?

Yeah.
I-I have one.

Thanks.

Goodnight.

That guy is insane.

Insane?

You think
everybody is insane.

No, I don't.

Yeah, you do.

No.

[wood rustling]

El Dorado.

What a joke.

Why do you wanna
go there, anyway?

Because of this.

You're sellin' drugs?

It's ashes.

Met this guy ...ve.

And he had the coolest ride.

It's a 1965, Electra Glide.

He just died.

On a bike?

'No''

'Playing some video game''

Wow, which one?
'I don't know.'

Poor fucker.

'He said, he wanted
to go to some place in Nevada''

El Dorado.

So, you've been searching
this whole time

to do somethin' righteous
for a friend?

Guess so.

That's cool.

That's really cool.

I thought finally,
by now, I mean

I gotta get back
to my job.

No, you gotta keep going,
you gotta find it.

Dave. Dave, wouldn't have
wanted it like that.

'You gotta find it.'

You said
El Dorado?

Yeah.
Okay.

I don't see
an El Dorado.

Could it be, could it be Elko?
It could be Ely?

Yeah, guess I could have
heard him wrong, you know.

We'll get up, first thing in
the morning, the crack of dawn

we can go tomorrow
and head straight to Ely.

You-you'll only miss
one more day of work.

You call and tell him, you broke
both your legs or something.

Okay.
Why not?

Hey. Why is this instrument of
potential torture still intact?

What?

It's your responsibility,
as campers

and as honorable men
on this planet

to cut through the connections
of these nooses

waiting to happen
before discarding 'em

in a proper refuse container.

What the fuck
are you talking about?

I'm talking about negligence
and murder.

People throw shit anywhere.
It ends up in the lake.

Duck dives down
to get some food

gets caught in
one of these things and drowns.

Curious baby beaver sees
one of these things floating by

it's dam, sticks his head
through it, swims off.

Beaver starts to mature,
next thing, you know

you got a strangled
adult beaver.

You wanna kill innocent
little water creatures?

No, sir.
No.

Good.

What the fuck was
that all about, man?

Saving little
water creatures.

Hey, look,
that insane guy is gone.

Hmm?

What do you think we oughta do
with these sleeping bags?

Keep them.

Keep them?

You only wanna stay
in Motel 9's.

Oh, yeah. We're going
to Northern Nevada.

Hey, listen, there's 12 Motel 9s
in Northern Nevada.

The one in Ely
has got 48 rooms.

Ride, ride.

'Come on, Joe.
Let's go.'

'We got ground
to cover.'

'The open road''

'The sky,
desert, bee''

'gas, ride forever''

The open road.

[upbeat music]

[music continues]

<i>[Joe] Hi, Angie, it's Joe. I got some bad news.</i>

<i>[Angie]
Oh, no. What?</i>

<i>[Joe] Well, the thing is, I-I broke my legs.</i>

<i>[Angie]
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?</i>

<i>[Joe] Hey, they're just hairline fractures.</i>

<i>I'll be fine, in a day or two.</i>

<i>[Angie] You poor thing. Do you want me to get you some workman's comp?</i>

<i>[Joe] Fuck, yeah, it's like free money.</i>

Hey, Joe.

If you suddenly got
a bunch of free money

what would you
do with it?

Buy another Harley.
56.

What would you do?

Exactly what we're doing?
Just hangin' out ridin'.

Did you and your dead friend
go on a bunch of rides together?

No, I didn't know him
that long.

Watch this.

[tires screeching]


Sam!

[Sam coughs]

Oh.

Ouch.

No..

No..

Are you okay?

Did you break anything?

My shifter.

'What are you doing?'

Taking you
to the hospital.

'What? No way.'

No way am I riding on the back
of someone's god damn bike.

Not even yours, Joe.
Don't be stupid.

I would rather walk and crawl
through this burning desert

on my bleeding
and torn knees.

'20 fucking miles.'

Uh, but..

No.

Joe.

Uh, there's..

[Sam grunts]


Hi, I'm Max.
Shh.

[crowd applauding]

Hey. Hey,
I need some help.

Is there a machine shop,
around here?

Hey.

Hey, wanna go to a meeting?
Huh?

A very happening one,
not far from here. Come on.

So, all the cappuccino,
you can drink.

Lot of famous Hollywood
celebrities go there. Come on.

One step at a time.

[male #8]
'I know how it is.'

'I've been there.
We all have.'

Start out, you roll
through a few stop signs.

Remember Billy Idol.

'Next thing you know'

'you're making lane
changes without signal.'

Then you fall in
with bad company.

Bunch of shiftless punks who got
no respect for the speed limit.

'One day your hay-fever
is acting up on you.'

So, you take
an antihistamine.

Get on your bike,
don't even think about it.

But you're ridin'
under the influence.

You bottomed out.

This is bullshit!

[man on radio]
'...finds that
the most common effect'

'of prolonged drug use
on young people today'

'is averse
to Christianity.'

Welcome to Oscar's house
of dead meat.

What will it be?

Uh, my friend here could use
a shifter for his bike.

Got one right here.

Wow.

Is this a dream?
If you believe in nightmares.

'Joe, I should go
I think.'

Oh, do not mind him.
It's called gallows humor.

Yeah, but it isn't funny.

Only, if you're in love
and waiting to die.

My name's Oscar.
This is my wife, Celeste.

I've got cancer,
she's got AIDS.

Joe, I think
we should go, now.

Oh, no, no!
Come on!

'Take a load off.'

Let me fix
your bike.

Let him fix
your bike.

'It's really weird''

I ain't done
any smack in years.

I was a secretary
in an insurance office.

Cleaned up,
straight.

You sure?
No, thanks.

I was bored
out of my fucking mind.

Real recovery
success story.

When I found out
I was gonna die young

I figured,
I got nothing to lose

so ...broke into operations
at the test site.

Test site?

Where they test
all the nuclear warheads.

You must've driven
right past it.

You've got
some sauce on you.

Anyway, I was
really pissed off

they were spending more money
to make people sick than well.

So, I broke in...and I chained
myself to the controls.

'Oscar started writing to me
from the underground'

'while I was in prison.'

'A woman after my own heart.'

I grew up 30 miles
from the test site.

I was dying the minute
I was born.

So is everybody.

[Oscar laughing]

So they are.

But I wanted
to change the world.

He was a revolutionary.

'I guess, you think
there's peace on earth.'

A million people in jail.

And they're building
more prisons than schools.

Hey, look, it's better
than it was, okay?

Did this kid suffer
a head injury recently?

[engine revving]

Are you sure
you're okay?

A lot better
than those guys.

They're insane.

No, they're not.

Hey! What are you doin'?

I'm just hanging out
with Dave.

That ain't funny.

Where's the cap?
I don't know.

'It's around here somewhere.'

What did you
take it off for?

I just wanted to get
to know him a little better.

Oh, here.

Now, come on.
We got to get to Ely.

It's 200 miles from here.

So?

Well...that's where
the nearest Motel 9 is.

They got 48 rooms there.

[engine revving]

They got safe parking
and everything.

HBO, free coffee
between 7 and 11 a.m.

'Donuts and air conditioning.'

Sam...you're fucking weird.

<i>[Pray for Rain's "Valley of Zoom" instrumental]</i>

<i>[Joe] Hi, Angie, it's Joe.</i>

<i>[Angie]
You're coming back
tomorrow, right?</i>

<i>Yeah. Good.</i>

<i>'Cause you know something?
I really miss you.</i>

What are you doing?

It's fucking raining,
man!

No, it isn't!

Wait! Where are you going?

Wait!

Joe.

Why are you
stopping here?

See that sign?

No.

It's right there.
I don't wanna stay here.

Fine, we'll go to the one
across the street

but the bar might
still be open here.

Come on, please. Another hour
and a half and we'll be in Ely.

There's a motel 9 there.
My treat.

Hey, fuck motel 9's!

My idea of a treat right now,
is a few beers, a warm bed

'and some TV!'

Joe, come on.
You got to!

Hey, I don't
got to do anything!

What about Dave?

Dave is in no hurry, man.
I wanna get some sleep.

But, what if that
casino is in Ely?

It'll be there tomorrow.

Hey, man,
I'm going without you.

Fine, fucking go.

Alright, then, you asshole.
I'm going. Fuck you!

No, fuck you!

Pussy!

[engine revving]

[thunder rumbling]

Is that a cocktail
lounge in there?

It's a room.

I've got a bottle
of Wild Turkey.

Somebody left behind,
last month.

Come on
and have a drink.

Have a seat.

Thanks, man.

So, if this
isn't a bar

what is it?

It is what anybody
wanna make of it.

Sometimes, it's a mason
meeting hall.

Sometimes,
the odd fellows.

There aren't too many people
around here, anymore.

You oughta visit
our cemetery.

My favorite one
is Fanny Peterson.

They loved till death
did them apart.

He killed her.

Death is the answer
for a lot of people.

Answer to what?
Whatever they're looking for.

Mostly, it's about love.

Either lost or yearned for.

'You know what I'm sayin'?'

Me, I spent my whole life
sitting on the sidelines.

Stayin' out of trouble.

'Goin' to work.
Payin' my taxes.'

Watchin' a lot of people die
tryin' to make their connection.

You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, sure.

Like, love connection,
or somethin'.

Chuck Woolery.

Boy, he's a funny guy,
isn't he?

That's right, kid.
He died from it.

I did.

'Real love and friendship,
more dangerous than death.'

Now, I'm so old

I sorta wish that I had lived
a little more reckless.

Yeah.

Find yourself
a friend, kid.

[engine revving]

It's your birthday, son.

So, have some fun
when you unwrap

and shoot your...aim.

'Birthday, son,
so have some..'

A guy riding a beat-up
Triumph, stay here?

Yep, sure did. You bet.

Is he still here?
No, sir.

Did you see which way
he was headed?

No, sir.

Is there a casino
around here, called, uh

Four Kings or Three Queens
or somethin'?

We don't go in for that
kind of stuff around here.

We're Mormons.
Oh.

Could I get you
a room or something?

'No.'

Thanks.

Be careful.

That highway 50

it's the loneliest
road in America.

<i>[Pray For Rain's 'The Loneliest Road In America']</i>

<i>[Joe]
Angie, listen, I'm gonna need
a little more time off.</i>

<i>[Angie] Why don't you just come out and say you don't wanna see me.</i>

<i>[Angie] You know, if it wasn't for me, you'd be out of a job.</i>

<i>[Joe]
I know. I promise I'll head
back tomorrow. If I don't...</i>

<i>[Angie]
My mom's been holding dinner,
for 3 days now.</i>

<i>[Joe]
Just one more day,
I mean, come on.</i>

<i>[Angie]
Well...alright.</i>

<i>But, promise, you'll call me
tonight, okay?</i>

<i>[Joe]
I promise.</i>

Hey, conquistador.

How are you doing?
I'm off tonight.

Well, get on.
Let's go somewhere.

So, how've you been?
I've been better.

You on your way
to the Yukon?

Yep, 43 more gigs,
4,000 more miles.

'Remember that guy, Sam?'

Your friend, right?

He has the weirdest thing
about motel 9's.

'Why?'

Fuck if I know.

But he's really alright.

How come you're not traveling
with him anymore?

He went to look
for a motel 9.

You know,
I think the place

I'm supposed to play tonight
is...wait a minute, let me see.

It is.
It's a motel 9.

Oh, really?
Yep.

[pleasant music]

[horse galloping]

Hey, what's the name
of this town again?

Jackpot.

That's fucking it.
What?

That's what he said.
Who?

Dave.
He said Jackpot.

Ride out and hit Jackpot.
El Dorado, dude!

Hey, look, and there's
the motel 9.

'And, that looks like
Sam's bike.'

Double O-1, double O-2.

What room
did the guy say?

Double O-4.

Hey, Sam!

Sam!

Shit.

You can come and stay
in my room if you want.

No, it's okay. Maybe, I'll look
for him, down in the bar.

Okay. Well, I gotta get
ready for work.

'Come see my show later?'

Yeah, sure.

[firecracker whizzing]

Sam?

Sam.

You are so fucking passive, man.

You listen to any goddamn shit,
and some fucking stranger

on the street's
gotta dish up for you.

You go east fuckin' Jesus and
back with some fuckin' gas can

filled with ashes of somebody
you barely even knew!

When it comes to
hanging out with somebody...

Hey, fuckin' cool out!

Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

When it comes to sticking around
for somebody who's lost

you're a fuckin' useless
sack of shit, man!

I mean, look at you. Even your
fuckin' bike is lame, man.

If you were cool, you'd have a
'56 Harley instead of that '57.


I didn't really mean it
about your bike.

It's alright, man. I'd rather
have a stock '56 anyway.


I fucking hate being alone.

Me too.

So, my grandma tells me

that they both
committed suicide.

That's supposed to
make me feel better.

Jesus, man.
Better than what?

Better than knowing
they abandoned me.

They checked into a Motel 9...
under fake names, right?

Never heard from 'em again.
'Fuck, man.'

So, that's your thing
with ...tel 9's, huh?

Yeah, that's my thing.

'Life is such a pain
in the ass.'

'I mean, you want it
to mean somethin''

and, be real and shit.

And, then all you get is...
like, some job and an ex-wife.

Then you start
feeling old, man.

You can't get anywhere either.

Oh, shit!

What?

I forgot
to call Angie.

Who's Angie?

[male #9]
'Where do you think
you're going?'

Just put it on my tab, man.

[woman on phone]
'Personnel.'

Could I speak to Angie?

'Just a minute.
Angie, it's for you.'

Who's Angie?

[woman on phone]
'Hold on a second.
She'll be with you in a minute''

'Hello?'
Hi, Angie. It's Joe.

'Little late to be calling.'
I know, I forgot.

But, uh, I'm calling you now.
'What for?'

To say,
I'll be home tomorrow.

'You're unemployed. I tore up
your workman's' comp forms.'

What?

'And I reported you
for absenteeism.'

Why?
'I thought you liked me.'

'I bought a hat for you.'
'Will you stop...'

'And my mom ruined
a whole bunch of good food.'

'She wanted us
to get married.'

An-Angie?

I hardly even know you.
'Tell that to my mom.'

Mom...

[dial tone]

Shit!

She tore up my workman's
comp forms

and then, reported me
for absenteeism.

Who's Angie?

'What?'

Nothing.

Nothing makes any difference
anyway, right?

You tell me.


It's your last supper, Caspar.
Free food for the poor!

You're under arrest.

Get off me, man!
God damn it!

Six more meals
and I would've made Guinness.

You have the right
to remain silent.

It's entrapment.
The marquee says free buffet.

Anything you say,
can and will be used

against you,
in a court of law.

You're an asshole!
You're a miscreant.

You have the right to have
a lawyer present at questioning.

Death to the fascist insects
that prey upon the people!

[officer #1]
'If you cannot afford
to hire a lawyer...'

I can't even afford food!
Come on.

[officer #1]
'The court will appoint one.'

I'm quite willing to carry out
the executions

of your daughters,
if I had the chance.

Death to the fascist
media empire

'that's working
another world tonight!'

Damn, man!

Just when you think
you got problems..

'Then death
to the fascist bugs!'

Give me liberty
or give me death!

No, no, no, no, no.

Poor, dead Dave.


You know what
his last words were

before he got fried
on the video machine?

He said, "Everybody
gets lucky at Jackpot!"

Alright!
Whoa!

Hey! Yeah!

Hey! Don't lose it all
in one place, pal!

Let's do it for Dave!
Whee!

How you doin'?
How you doin'?

How much
should we get, Joe?

How much
do we got, Sam?


[rock music]

â™ª Now today, made a promise â™ª

â™ª So sweetly â™ª

â™ª And you've got the situation
well in hand â™ª

â™ª As a smile grows upon your
face so discreetly â™ª

â™ª Like a shadow
across the land â™ª

â™ª Now today up is up
but tomorrow you're up â™ª

â™ª Maybe coming down â™ª

â™ª Tomorrow may come crashing â™ª

â™ª On your head â™ª

â™ª And spin your little world â™ª

â™ª Around it â™ª

â™ª It's time to come on down
to the roadside â™ª

â™ª You know the waiter â™ª

â™ª Down by the roadside â™ª

Dave wouldn't want it
to end like this, man.

Are you listening to me?
Now, don't screw this thing up.

Okay.

'Cause I got a plan.
Let me do the talking.

Okay.

Hey, again.
Hi.

You know, a close friend
of mine, Mr. Da-David Coleman.

Formerly of San Moreno,
California. He suggested that...

Dave Coleman?

Yeah!

That's right,
Mr. David Coleman.

He said that you'd lend us extra
money just in case we needed it.

Well, of course.
How much do you need?

Uhm...300?

Thousand.

Oh, 300,000 is more
than we have in our bank.

I'm afraid we're not
that large of an organization.

You know,
he meant 3,000.

Oh, well,
now, that we can do.

That's one..

...two..

'...and, three.'

Thank you!

'Good luck.'

Hm-m-m.

But you don't absolutely
have to pay it in cash.

We do accept certificates of
deposit, or treasury bills

Or jewelry, titles
to motor vehicles.

No fucking way!

Joe, you can't.

We got no choice, man.

[Labia Mirage]
'Hey, conquistador.
How's it going?'

'Don't ask.'

Our policy is one half
of the blue book value.

What are you doing?

Cashing in our bikes.

Ha! You're joking, right?

Nope.

But why?

Blame it on Dave.

Sir, the value of these
two motorcycles divided by 2

adds up to $2,800.

I'm going to need another 200
to expunge your debt.

Did you say $2,800?

You know, my bike is worth
8 times that much?

I spend 13 years
building that bike.

I'm terribly sorry, sir.

But I'm still gonna need
another 200.

You think if I had $200,
I'd be selling my bike?

Joe, Joe, come on. Come on.
Take it easy, Joe.

Will this help?

I hate this job, sometimes.

It's wonderful
when I can pay people out.

But when I have to take
people's money and valuables

away from 'em..

Oh, dear. Here's ten bucks,
just walking around money.

Come on, come on, Joe.
Come on.

Are you alright, Joe?
What do you think?

[man snoring]

Shut up, asshole.
Heh.

Hey, Joe, we got ten dollars.
Terrific.

You wanna keep it?
No. I'll lose that too.

Miss Mirage.
Miss Mirage.

The bus will be here any minute.
Felt you need these.

Thank you.
Sure.

Hey, I wanna pay you
back that 200.

Don't worry about it. I've got
another gig tonight at Idaho.

I'll make it up.

No, really, like,
I'll send it to you.

How?

Well..

...uh, Miss Labia Mirage,
care of Yukon.

Ha. It's Prudence.

[no audio]

I got your stuff.
Thanks, man.

Well..

"Well", what?

Well, let's go dump Dave.

[insects chirping]

Here.

Here?

Should we do something?

Like what?

I don't know, pray?

Pray?

[clears throat]
You know, like a moment
of silence or something.

Maybe we'll get
a sign.

I don't know, man.

The only sign I'm gettin' is
that it's a long way back to LA.

Let's go.

W-wait, Joe, hold on.

[melancholic music]

So, when did you start believing
in religious stuff?

I don't.

It's a stupid idea.

You know what's stupid is
losing your job and your bike.

Just so you can dump
what's left of some stranger

out in the middle
of nowhere.

What's stupid, is searching
every Motel 9 across America

trying to find
two shithead parents

you barely even remember.

Did you really think
you'd find 'em?

No.

[vehicles approaching]

Huh, so much
for rush hour.

[female #4]
'Hey!'

You guys!

Hey!

'Hey!'

Which way is Idaho?

It's about five miles
that way.

Do you guys got a smoke?

Give her
a cigarette, Joe.

Aren't you a little young
to be smoking?

What are you?
Her dad?

Lucky he's not. I'd kick him in
the shins right now if he were.

Here.

My name is Sam.

I'm Gloria.
He's Joe, right?

Why you goin' to Idaho?
I'm not really going to Idaho.

Too many Right-To-Life-er's
and Neo-Nazi's.

I just have to get to a state
where I won't be extradited.

Huh?
I'm a refugee.

I ran away from this reform
school called Camp America

that my parents
put me in.

What'd they do that for?

I came home from a BDP concert
at 1 o'clock.

And they freaked out.
They kept screaming

that I was in the clutches
of a Satanic cult

organized by narco-terrorists.

No shit.

They didn't even let me sleep,
and drove me to the airport.

We live in Houston. And sent me
to this witch, Mrs. Gorren.

Along with a check for 15 grand.

So I can learn
some "decent values."

$15,000?

Hey, brain washing's
expensive these days.

Bummer was, that was supposed
to be my college fund.

[vehicle approaching]

I'd better get going.
So, where are you going?

Well, where I really
wanna go is Haiti.

There's more under-educated
people there than anywhere else

in this hemisphere.
Except for maybe here.

I figure I could teach kids
to read or something.

'But it'll be hard to get a
visa, plane ticket or anything''

So, I figured I'd hitch up
to Alaska and watch sea otters.

It's turning into one big
oil swamp up there.

Where you guys headed?

Back to LA.
What for?

Well, I gotta try to get my job
back. Get another motorcycle.

Oh, I'm thinking of getting
into Psychotherapy.

Later.

So, what's wrong with that?

You're just a couple of
self-indulgent pussies

burrowing into your own
stupid, little cocoons.

You probably love that
"Don't worry be happy" song.

I hated that song.

There's a whole world
changing out there.

I guess if you wanna
die in the vine

with the Empire in decline,
it's up to you.

She shouldn't be hitch-hiking
you know.

She's so young and...

Insane?

No...smart.

Hey, wait.
Wait up.

'Comin'?'

Nah.

Gonna miss you, Joe.

Yeah, don't worry
about it, man.

I'll call you
when we get somewhere.

You can't call me.

You don't know
my last name.

Where you headed?

Idaho, maybe Alaska.
