Cassandra was not the one.

It appears she was not.

Youâ€™ll be entering
your 100th year.
We must find the one.

I am more than aware of
what will happen if we do not.

We donâ€™t have much time.
Youâ€™ve got ancient blood that--

Thank you for
the reminder, Logan.

Iâ€™m aware of my lineage
and what I must do.

Los Angeles.

The City of Angels.

Let us hope that I find mine.

â™ª Iâ€™ll make you burn,
then Iâ€™ll make you
fall asleep â™ª

â™ª Youâ€™ll feel dead
when youâ€™re laying under me â™ª

â™ª If I take a shot,
baby, will it sting? â™ª

â™ª Just turn me on,
and Iâ€™ll do my thing â™ª

â™ª Wonâ€™t let you crash,
and I wonâ€™t let you bleed â™ª

â™ª Youâ€™re like a virus â™ª

Hey.

Hey, let me help you with those.

So, this is the place, huh?

Yeah.

I know itâ€™s not much,
but it does keep the rain out.

Iâ€™m sorry.
I didnâ€™t mean to be rude.

Itâ€™s just like the pictures
you sent me online.

Hey, no offense taken.

Great first impression, huh?
Yeah.

Iâ€™m Caleb.
Iâ€™m Paul.

Itâ€™s really nice
to finally meet you.

Letâ€™s take your stuff inside
and get you settled,

and Iâ€™ll show you
around the place.

Sounds like a plan.

Hey, dude, dude.
Not on the grass. Come on.

Home sweet home.

This place is really...

great.

Well, I mean,
itâ€™s functional,

but what more does
a college student need, right?

Not much more, I suppose.

So, uh, first time
being away from home.

Iâ€™ve been on my own
about two years now,

and I love my freedom.

If you donâ€™t mind my asking,

how did you find
such a great place so cheap?

You know, I mean,
I have my connections.

Actually, um, my parents
used to own this place,

so itâ€™s all paid for
free and clear.

Pretty sweet deal.

Yeah, no shit.

Besides, I have no desire
to be anywhere else.

Iâ€™m a California boy
through and through.

Sure beats living in Ohio.

Doesnâ€™t it smell there?

Donâ€™t remind me.

Let me take you to the bedroom.

Itâ€™s really great-- you
letting me stay here for free.

Hey, like I said,
this place is all paid for,

and utilities donâ€™t cost much,
so you can pitch in with those.

Sounds more than fair.

I was actually gonna
have some coffee.
Care to join me?

I can show you
the neighborhood a bit.
My treat.

That sounds nice.

Itâ€™s a pretty
friendly neighborhood.

I can see that.
Quiet, too.

Yeah, and theyâ€™re
pretty receptive

to, uh,
all types of people.

Good to know.

Not bad.

This was a really great idea.
Thanks.

Hey. My pleasure.

So, what did you do
in high school?

Basketball? Football?

Swimming was my thing.

All-state champ
three years in a row.

Impressive. You could be
the next Michael Phelps.

I have hung up my Speedo.

Focusing solely on academics.

Mmm. A brainy jock.

So few in existence.

Oh, we are a rare breed.


Oh, another beautiful
California day.

Even though I canâ€™t
feel the heat of the sun,

Iâ€™m so pleased that the myths
about vampires and the sun

were just that-- myths.

Yeah. Skin still tans
pretty well, too.

You two can be absolutely
ridiculous at times.

Sorry, Logan, weâ€™re not
as old and mature as you.

Or as fat.
Children.

Both of you.
Forever and ever.

What did you see?

It was a person.
A male.

Someone who will
cross our path?

Yes. Someone who will be
very important to me.

The one?
Donâ€™t be stupid.

He found the one.
Tara?

I donâ€™t know if she is.

What did he look like?

I-- I cannot remember.

But I will know him again
if I see him.

I think there was a connection,

and I think he felt it, too.

[snapping fingers]
Are you okay?

Are you okay?

Yeah.

That was really weird.

Uh...

Sorry about that.

Hey, itâ€™s okay.

But are you okay?

Um, what were we talking about?

Classes tomorrow.

Great. I canâ€™t believe
I just got here,

and I have to jump
right back into classes.

Are you sure youâ€™re okay?

You look a little pale.

I will be.
Maybe, just, um,

rest a little
when we get back to the house.

Okay. Um,
letâ€™s head back then.

Come on.

Hello?

Whoâ€™s there?

Iâ€™ve seen you before.

And I have seen you.

Who are you?

I would like to know
the same of you.

I donâ€™t understand
whatâ€™s going on.

Dreams are often subject
to interpretation.

Is this a dream?

Would you prefer a nightmare?

No.

Weâ€™ll meet again.

Morning.
Hey. Morning.

Coffeeâ€™s ready.

Awkward.

Um, let me go
throw something on.

Hey, itâ€™s not a big deal for me
if it isnâ€™t for you.

Weâ€™re roommates, right?

So, you ready
for your first day?

I think so. I didnâ€™t get
very much sleep last night.

Homesick?
Nothing like that.

I had a weird dream.

You remember any of it?

I feel like
I should remember it,

but every time I try,

nothing comes to me.

Well, youâ€™ll have plenty
to take your mind off it today.

I took the liberty of looking up
your classes online,

and we have some
classes together.

Excellent.

I hate being
in new situations

with everybody staring at me.

Mmm.

So, howâ€™s the first
few hours been?

Pretty good, and I think
Iâ€™m getting into college life.

Ah. Just wait until
the parties start.

Thatâ€™s true college life.

â™ª SOS â™ª

â™ª SOS â™ª

â™ª Doctor, doctor,
doctor, doctor â™ª

â™ª In my chest â™ª

â™ª In my chest â™ª

â™ª Monster, monster, monster â™ª

-â™ª Send me an SOS â™ª
-â™ª SOS â™ª

â™ª Send me a doctor â™ª

Who are they?

Um, I donâ€™t know.

I mean, Iâ€™ve never seen them
on campus before.

Hi, my nameâ€™s Jasin.

Youâ€™re new here,
arenâ€™t you?

Just moved here yesterday.

Hi, Iâ€™m Paul, his roommate.

I did not mean
to come across forward.

I fancy myself a welcome wagon
of sorts.

Itâ€™s not a problem at all.

How rude of me.
Paul, did you say?

Yeah.

Let me introduce my brothers.

This is Logan, Dane, and Adam.

Brothers?

Something like that.

Hey, guys. Iâ€™m...Paul.

They donâ€™t say much.

I saw you in class
earlier today.

It looks like
weâ€™ll be seeing each other
every morning.

I suppose so.

Can I expect coffee
every morning?

You just never know.

There you are.

Hey, guys.

So, who are your new friends?

I am just neglecting
my manners completely today.

Iâ€™m Caleb. This is Paul.

I think you were in one of
my classes this morning.

Iâ€™m Tara.

Possibly. Was it psych?

I thought you looked familiar.

Yeah. Small world.

So, will I see you tonight?

Actually,
I was just getting ready

to ask my new friend here

if he would like
a tour of the city.

Youâ€™re new to L.A.?

Fresh off the boat.

How about it, Caleb?

Uh, yeah,
that would be great.

Well, I suppose
I can take a rain check.

We donâ€™t have anything
planned this evening, do we?

Um, no. No.

I mean, go have fun.

Are you sure?
What if he came with us?

Would that be okay?

Go. I mean, Iâ€™ve seen the city
a thousand times.

So, you know,
weâ€™ll catch up later.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

We are roommates, right?
Weâ€™ll be seeing each other
in no time.

Itâ€™s bound to happen.

So this evening.
I can pick you up.

I donâ€™t have a car,
so that would be great.

Uh...

Uh, here is where
Iâ€™ll be staying.

I put my cell on there, too.

Excellent.

I think we should go anyway.
Your first class
is about to start.

Uh, we have this one
together, right?

Yeah.
Uh, excellent.

Iâ€™ll be there around 9:00.

Iâ€™ll see you this evening.

That was interesting.

Iâ€™m sorry?

Heâ€™s a fine catch
for sure, but...

Let it be, Logan.
Mind your own business, Adam.

Jasin finding the right one
is my business,
in case youâ€™ve forgotten.

We all need this.
Remember, his fate
is our fate.

Letâ€™s not dwell on it
for the moment.

So, what, are you having
second thoughts about Tara?

There is something about Caleb.

Something I cannot describe.

His blood.
Iâ€™ve never inhaled
such a fragrance.

Oh, heâ€™s definitely appetizing.

He is off-limits.
Do you all understand?

He is not to be harmed
in any way.

You think heâ€™s the one.

Anything is possible.

I must feed before tonight.

Itâ€™s getting late.
Yeah.

Trevor, whereâ€™s the spot
youâ€™ve got all picked out?

Relax. Itâ€™s close.

Itâ€™s worth the wait.

[clicks teeth]
Wow.

Isnâ€™t this worth the wait?

Speaking of waiting, Eli,

you wanna know what Iâ€™ve
been waiting a long time for?

What?

To kiss you.

Whoa. Awkward.
What are you getting at?

Iâ€™m getting at

I think that the three of us
make a nice couple, donâ€™t you?

Two of us make a couple,
but three of us--
Enough, Trevor.

Eli, do you find me attractive?

You know I always have.

Jen, youâ€™re my girlfriend.
Whatâ€™s the deal?


Would you be interested
in sex in the outdoors?

Here?

Jen,

I thought we only
talked about this.


Are you sure? With Eli?

I think Iâ€™m picking up
on what youâ€™re hinting at.

Okay. Jesus, Trevor.
You wouldnâ€™t pick up
on what Iâ€™m hinting at

if FedEx delivered
an invitation to your door.

Okay? This is not a hint.

I am balls-out asking.

Pardon the expression.

I follow you, Jen.

Okay.

So, now,

to get to me,

youâ€™re gonna have to go
through him first.

Huh?

I want you guys

to strip down

and then give each other
a nice big kiss.

Iâ€™m getting hot
just thinking about it.

I want you guys to start
taking your clothes off,

or Iâ€™m gonna start
putting more clothing on.

Yes.

Pants, boys.

Okay.

[mouths words]

Okay.

Now you guys
better kiss each other.

Well, what do you know?

Ah, the shy type.
I like that.

We donâ€™t want any trouble.
Weâ€™ll leave.

Yeah, the place is all yours.

Ah, we were hoping
youâ€™d stick around.

Six guys, one girl.

Alone in a field.
Sounds like a party to me.

You wouldnâ€™t wanna leave
the party now, would you?

Open your eyes.

I said, open your eyes!


Your blood smells weak,

but I have not fed
in a very long, long time.

So I will sacrifice
my own palate

in order to satiate
the nerving hunger

building inside of me.

[screaming]
[screaming]



Now I will not crave
his blood tonight.

[shower running]

â™ª Iâ€™m crushed and lonely â™ª

â™ª It cannot be the end of â™ª

â™ª â€™Cause I wonâ€™t-- â™ª

[wolf whistle]

Yeah, right.

No calls.

What time is it?

Nearly 9:00.

So, uh, what are you guys
gonna do?

I donâ€™t know.
It happened really fast.

Iâ€™ll say.
Whatâ€™s that supposed to mean?

Nothing.

I mean, neither of us
know this guy very well,

and Iâ€™ve never seen him
around campus before.

Heâ€™s extending the proverbial
olive branch,

trying to meet new people.

Right. Except that
he didnâ€™t invite me.

Are you jealous?

No, of course not.

Donâ€™t be stupid.
[phone ringing]

Hello?

Are you outside?

Do you wanna come in?

Okay. Iâ€™ll be right out.

Wait.
Heâ€™s been sitting outside?

Donâ€™t wait up for me, okay?


Well, have fun.

Donâ€™t forget
we have classes tomorrow.

Thanks, Dad.

Good evening.
Hey, there.

Nice night, huh?
Even better now.

You didnâ€™t have to do that.

It would do my mother proud
to see I have not

totally abandoned
all of my upbringing.

Wouldnâ€™t want to disappoint
your mother, would we?

So tell me a few things
about yourself.

You get right to the point.

Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m always bad
with breaking the ice.

I just jump right in,

hoping to avoid
any awkwardness.

How about I just hit you
with a blizzard of questions,

and you can answer which ones
you feel comfortable?

Sounds fair,
only if I can do the same.

Where are you from?

Ohio.

Oh, youâ€™re a long way from home.

That was kind of the point.

Why is that?

I just wanted to get away
from the whole Midwestern world.

I wish I understood
what that meant.

I was the all-star swim champ
in a small town.

I was kind of treated
like a god.

That doesnâ€™t sound too bad.

It got very demanding,
very tiring.

It just wasnâ€™t my thing.

The perfect all-American boy.

Something like that.

Okay. Next question.

Whatâ€™s the story
with you and your roommate?

Paul?

I answered an online ad
for a roommate.

We started sending e-mails
back and forth.

I really donâ€™t know
that much about him.

And you trust him enough
to move into his home.

He seems harmless enough.

He seems...nice.

I probably shouldnâ€™t.

Donâ€™t wanna put on
the freshman 15.

You look great.

Thanks.

So let me ask you a question.

Um, whatâ€™s your last name?

Gavlin.

And where are you from?

Ah, thatâ€™s two questions.

Just playing catch-up.

Fair enough.

I have been all over,
but I was born in London.

No accent?

No. My family moved to
the States when I was only two.

Not enough time
to develop the accent.

Are you going to be swimming
for the school?

No interest.
Purely academic.

The other three guys--
who are they?

Just some very close friends.

We have been together
a long time.

Uh, they are like brothers
to me.

Itâ€™s good to have
a close circle of friends.

And Tara?

She and I have been dating
for several months now.

Uh, but I wanna know

more about Caleb--

Caleb...

Donovan.

Caleb Donovan.

Well, thereâ€™s not much to tell.

I really just wanna focus
on school while Iâ€™m here.

Graduate, good job,

uh, make the most out of life.

Travel,
the whole nine yards.

That sounds like
the perfect plan.

I have my own plan
for the future.

Really? What is that?

Maybe weâ€™ll save that
for another time.

I had a really
great time tonight.

As did I.

So Iâ€™ll see you tomorrow?

I believe that is possible.

Um,

see you tomorrow.

Hey.
Hey. How was your morning?

Not bad so far. Yours?
Just a few pages.
Nothing major.

Yeah. Itâ€™s already the first few
days of class, and theyâ€™re
starting full force, huh?

So whatâ€™s for lunch?
I donâ€™t know,

but I was thinking
of something nice and greasy.

Cafeteria foodâ€™s pretty lame.
Yeah.

Do you wanna go off campus?

No. I have another class
in 20 minutes.

Okay. Well,
maybe this evening.

Dinner?

Yeah.
A big greasy hamburger,

French fries,
double-chocolate shake.

Thatâ€™ll take
a few days to work off.

Well, Iâ€™m gonna go
to the house.

Iâ€™ll see you later.

[Caleb]
So glad this day is over.
Yeah. No shit.

Jasin!
Oh, boy.

Caleb, I was looking
for you today.

Hey. I didnâ€™t see you
in class this morning.

Would you mind if I borrow him
for a few hours this evening?

Um, we kind of already
have plans.

I promise to have him back
before midnight.

We did have plans
to go to dinner.

You know what?
Itâ€™s okay. Go.

I mean,
weâ€™ll catch up later.

Are you sure?
I mean, we did have plans first.

Itâ€™s fine. I have some work
to get started on anyways.

Have fun.

Hop in.


[Men muttering]

[muttering continues]


Itâ€™s so peaceful here.

Yes. One of
my favorite places.

I had a really nice time
last night.

As did I.

I was hoping it wouldâ€™ve
lasted much longer.

I guess Iâ€™m rather selfish
that way.

Nothing wrong with that.

Paul doesnâ€™t seem
too pleased with me.

Why do you say that?

I get a sense he is not a fan.

Iâ€™m sorry you feel that way.

Donâ€™t be sorry.

Ah.

[metallic clank]
Ah. Yeah.


Jasin!

Did I hit something?
You-- You hit something.

Go, go, go. Shit.

Shit. Are you all right?

Weâ€™re fine.
You sure, man?

We were shooting cans, and,
you know, a stray bullet
went off.

No harm done.
Jasin, I saw.

You are free to inspect me
if it will make you feel better.

Okay.

So-- So weâ€™re cool?

Yes.
Youâ€™re all right?

No need for further apologies.
Weâ€™re fine.

Weâ€™re all good.
All righty.

Iâ€™m fine.

You got hit.
I saw you get hit.

Itâ€™s what you think you saw.

Go ahead.
You will find not a mark on me.

It all happened so fast.

However, I do feel
this has put a strain

on the afternoon.

I should say so.

Come. Iâ€™ll take you home.

Surfing?
Hey.

Um, sort of.

How much do you
really know about Jasin?

Donâ€™t start that again.
Itâ€™s getting a little old.

No, Iâ€™m serious.

Look, I appreciate
your protective nature,

but Iâ€™m a big boy.

But how much
do we know about him?
Indulge me.

Okay. Heâ€™s not
a California native.
Heâ€™s 20 years old.

He likes long walks
on the beach
and puppy dogs and rainbows.

What do you want me to say?
Look, Iâ€™m fucking serious.

Come on.
I mean, I went through
the school directory online.

I couldnâ€™t find anything
for a Jason Gavlin.

He doesnâ€™t have a Facebook page,
and I couldnâ€™t find him
on Google.

Do you hear yourself?
What is this paranoia?

I donâ€™t have a Facebook page.
Does that mean thereâ€™s something
wrong with me?

No. I mean,
Iâ€™m just worried, okay?

Well, you donâ€™t have to be.

Jasinâ€™s a good guy,
and I like hanging out with him.

Iâ€™m sorry if you donâ€™t
feel the same way.
But Iâ€™m concerned.

Youâ€™re getting too close
too fast.
That is none of your business.

You donâ€™t understand.
Thatâ€™s because you arenâ€™t
making any sense.

Wait a minute.
Youâ€™re jealous, arenâ€™t you?

Jealousy has nothing
to do with it.

Youâ€™re full of shit.
You canâ€™t stand the fact

that Iâ€™m hanging out with Jasin
and youâ€™re not.

You are jealous.

You know what?
I am jealous.

Iâ€™m jealous of him
and jealous itâ€™s not me
spending all that time with you.

Whatâ€™s your fucking problem?
It should be me, not him.

Look, itâ€™s just not like that
with us, okay?

Weâ€™re just friends
and roommates.

But we could be more.

I mean, what is so fucking
special about Jasin, huh?

Why are you so drawn to him?

Itâ€™s none of your business.

Why canâ€™t you
just be my friend?
I have friends.

This is too much.
I have to go.

Please donâ€™t leave.
Letâ€™s talk about this.

This is too intense for me.
I have to clear my head.

Then go find
your precious Jasin.

I mean, I hope you two
will be very happy together.

Why donâ€™t you just
go live with him?
Thatâ€™s a good idea.

When you come back,
your stuff will be packed.


Ohh!

Paul is becoming
a very big problem for Caleb.

You want us to pay him a visit?

Caleb has left the house.

Heâ€™s angry, confused.

I will not have him
feeling this way.

What do you want us to do?

I need to find Caleb.

Itâ€™s time he knew
the truth about me.

And youâ€™re sure heâ€™s the one?

Make it clean.

Penny for your thoughts.

Hey.

You look a little upset.

Everything okay?

Anything I can do?

Keep me company.

Did something happen?

Paul and I had a fight.

Youâ€™re right.
Heâ€™s not a big fan of yours.

Told you so.

He crossed a line today--

one I didnâ€™t wanna
cross with him.

Things are just a little
confusing for me right now.

How can I make it better?

Your being here makes it better.

I am pleased to hear that.

Caleb?

I wanna apologize.

Caleb!

Caleb!


Are you leaving already?
You just got here.

Hey-- Hey, guys.
Um, have you seen Caleb?

Heâ€™s occupied at the moment.

Youâ€™ve become a little bit
of a problem for Jasin.

[chuckling]
What do you mean?

You shouldâ€™ve stayed
away from Caleb.

Look, Calebâ€™s my friend.

Iâ€™m trying to find him
to apologize.

Well, heâ€™s more than that
to Jasin.

Yeah. We will not allow you
to stand in their way.


â™ª Ooh, babe â™ª

â™ª I wanna take you
on the West Coast â™ª

â™ª And light your fire
down on East Coast â™ª

â™ª So I can make you
fall in love with my smile â™ª

â™ª â€™Cause, babe â™ª

â™ª Should I get down
on my knees â™ª

â™ª And beg you
pretty, pretty please â™ª

â™ª You know, so you wonâ€™t
leave me, me, me, me, me, me â™ª

â™ª Where you are â™ª

â™ª Come with me,
Iâ€™ll tell you who we are â™ª

â™ª Where you are â™ª

â™ª I will always be
where you are â™ª

â™ª â€™Cause thereâ€™s no one there
for you anytime â™ª

â™ª Baby, take the chance â™ª

â™ª Hereâ€™s the starting line â™ª

â™ª Where you are â™ª

â™ª Come with me,
Iâ€™ll be where you are â™ª

I knew I was right about you.

What, you knew
that Iâ€™d put out?

No.

I knew that you were the one.

I donâ€™t understand.

Itâ€™s rather complicated,
but I promise I will tell you.

Whatâ€™s wrong with now?

As I said, itâ€™s complicated.

I can handle complex situations.

Iâ€™m sure you are more
than capable.

Something wrong?

I just donâ€™t think things
are working out with Paul.

Youâ€™re-- Youâ€™re right.
Heâ€™s not a big fan of yours.

I was not put on this earth
to please everyone.

I can live with that.

He freaked out on me.

He started going off
about how youâ€™re not

in the school directory
and stuff like that.

He does know that hacking
is a punishable offense, right?

He kissed me.

Did you kiss him back?

No.

Well, his lips were on mine,

so I suppose so.

What I mean is,
when he kissed you,
did you accept it?

No, I pulled away.

Then you did not
kiss him back.

I suppose so.

Let me show you what I mean.

What the hell was that?

Iâ€™m sorry.
I did not mean

to be so quick about
revealing my secret to you.

I suppose I just
could not resist.

You truly have no idea

you are the one.

What the fuck
are you talking about?

Like I said,
itâ€™s really complicated,

but you need to know the truth.

I am...

You are what?

Even if I tell you the truth,

your mind will not be able
to comprehend it.

You said you wanted me to know.
Tell me.

Itâ€™s more complicated
than just blurting the word--

I donâ€™t care.
You tell me the truth.

I am a vampire.

What? What?

What the hell
are you talking about?
If youâ€™ll let me explain--

Like I said, itâ€™s complicated.

Please, if you will
let me explain.

No. Stay away from me.

No...

Shit.

[vampires laughing]


Whoo-hoo-hoo!

[howling]
Yeah!

Burn, baby!
[mutters]

Did you take care of Paul?

Would you expect anything less?

Itâ€™s amazing
how some humans burn.

I do not find that
the least bit comical.

Sorry.

Yeah. Sorry, Jasin.

By the look on your face,
I can see that he didnâ€™t
accept the truth.

What makes you believe
I divulged anything to him?

Oh, you slept with him.

The way youâ€™ve been going
on and on

about this connection
that you have...

You love him.

And you told him,
didnâ€™t you?

I did.

Let me guess.
He had the exact same reaction

that Cassandra did.

Cassandra accepted
the initial idea
of being with a vampire.

Itâ€™s still unclear to me
as to what changed with her.

What about Tara?
You were convinced

that she was the one
before Caleb was even
in the picture.

What happened?

This decision is greater
than any other

Iâ€™ve been forced to make.

I must be sure
to choose wisely...

with my heart.

Are you sure thatâ€™s what
youâ€™re choosing with?

What are you implying?
Logan, you know that
Jasin is sincere.

Heâ€™s not just thinking
with his dick.

Let a vampire be in love.

If heâ€™s not,

then weâ€™ll all soon perish.

I do not wanna think about that.

He will make the right decision.

Mind your own business,
both of you.

I have been through this

with him more times
than you can count.

Weâ€™ve all been part of
this coven for many, many years.

We stand behind Jasin
and his decision.

Thank you for your loyalty.

Caleb...is a phase.

Taraâ€™s the one
youâ€™re supposed to be with.
You know that.

I believe that decision
is left up to me,
is it not?

Jasin,

I know how you feel
about Caleb.

I know that you think
that he is the one.

But how can you be sure?

Youâ€™ve only known him
for a few days.

Are you challenging me, Logan?

I do not wanna die
because you canâ€™t figure out

who you wanna spend
eternity with.

But I donâ€™t have a choice.

You created me,

and I perish when you do.

I agree that it is not fair,
but I did not write the rules.

I am bound to them more so
than any of you.

Then why donâ€™t you just
make Tara one tonight?

Sheâ€™s ready
to be turned, and--
Enough discussion.

Evening, boys.

Did I come at a bad time?

Everything is as it should be.

How are you this evening?

Come on, guys.

Why donâ€™t we give them
their privacy?

Something wrong with Logan?

Nothing at all.

So, are you going to make me
a vampire tonight or what?

Not tonight.

Soon, I hope?

I will follow you
to the ends of the earth.

Paul?

Paul?



What the hell?

Ow. Damn it.

I didnâ€™t mean to startle you.

And Iâ€™m sorry about the pot.

I wasnâ€™t sure
how to get your attention.

Shouldnâ€™t you be in a pile
of dust or something?

Youâ€™d be surprised
how many myths are false.

Like the myth
about vampires existing?

Yes. Well, I can assure you,
that one is true.

Howâ€™s that?

Can we talk?

Do vampires drink coffee?

I would love some.

I thought you said
youâ€™d love a cup.

Iâ€™m on my third already.

Iâ€™m sorry.

That is rude of me.

It must be stone-cold by now.

Itâ€™s okay.

I really do not need it.

I do not sleep.

Okay. So, letâ€™s say
I believed you.

What is a vampire doing
in California?

The sun would destroy you,
wouldnâ€™t it?

As I said earlier,
thatâ€™s just a myth.

Only the elder vampires
are affected by the sun.

Elder vampires?

There is so much to tell.

I will get to that.

Well, where are your fangs?

What, are you saying
thatâ€™s a myth, too?

No. Fangs are a necessity.

Shit.

So, why didnâ€™t you

suck my blood?

I mean, donâ€™t get me wrong.
Iâ€™m happy to be alive.

But...

Shall I start
from the beginning?

They say thatâ€™s the best place.

Iâ€™ll condense
some of the details.

The story is as old as I.

How old are you?

I am forever frozen
at the age of 20.

However, I have walked
the earth as a vampire

for nearly 100 years.

Iâ€™m all ears.

Uh, nearly 100 years ago,

an elder vampire named Naran

found me near death,

lying in a street.

I do not even remember
the city, state

or country Iâ€™m from.

I remember his eyes,

and then the pain
of his fangs in my neck.

And the years passed.

He and I were together as one.

He filled my head with stories
of the elder vampires

and their legends.

He taught me everything
about being a vampire.

He taught me to hunt.

And he taught me about love.

Have you--

Have you ever killed?

Another truth among the myths.

Yes, vampires are sustained
by human blood.

We can survive on animals
but only for so long.

You said he taught you
about love.

Yes.

I was Naranâ€™s chosen one.

In order to stay immortal,

an elder must choose
a companion,

another who will complete them.

Like yin and yang,
if you will.

And you were his chosen one.

I was for a time.

As an elder vampire,
Naran would not be satisfied

with only one mortal.

Even after he turned me,
he was not fulfilled.

He found another

and turned her into a vampire.

What happened to him?

I have no idea.

He left me in England,
and I have not seen him since.

So, you think Iâ€™m
your chosen one?

Yes.

See, because I was turned
by an elder,

I must do the same

or I will not survive.

But I thought that vampires
were immortal.

I mean, you are over
100 years old.

Very true.

However, without a companion,

upon our 100th vampire year,

we cease to exist.

Thatâ€™s a new one
to add to the list.

Yes. Odd as it is,

it is very true.

What about mirrors?

You think this hair
gets this way on its own?

A mirror does help.

Crosses?
As you can see,

Iâ€™ve always been partial
to their religious significance.

Garlic?

Myth.

Stake through the heart?

You saw that a bullet
did not pierce my skin.

Do you really think
a sharpened piece of wood
could do the trick?

Point taken.

As for the sun,

we hybrids still have
some traces of human blood,

so weâ€™re not affected
by its rays.

I donâ€™t make the rules.

Dane, Adam, and Logan
are also not affected.

I created them.

Theyâ€™re vampires, too.

Weâ€™re a small coven.

I needed companions,

and they have been aiding
in my journey

for my eternal mate.

Pretty tight group.

Very much so.

So...

Yes?

How do you kill a vampire?

Why? Do you wanna kill me?

No.

Decapitation
is the only sure way.

Decapitation.

Uh...

So what will happen to me?

Are you going to turn me?

Uh, yes,
it has come to that.

I will not force you.

If you feel for me

the way I feel for you,

you will choose
to be with me forever.

And if not?

Tara is aware of my true self.

She was to be
the one originally.

What happened?

Truth be told,
you happened.

I cannot explain it,

but you have this tremendous
pull over me.

So I would become a vampire.

Yes, that is the idea.

This is all too much.

First, Paul goes missing,
and now this.

How long do I have to decide?

My 100th year as a vampire
is tomorrow, midnight.

Are you kidding?

I have to decide
in that short amount of time?

I will not force you
to make any decision

you do not want to.

Look, I am aware
of the weight of all this.

That is why Iâ€™m giving you
the choice.

The choice I never had.

You truly have no idea
the impact youâ€™ve had on me.

This is all happening
so fast.

Why donâ€™t you take a few hours
to think things over?

I will honor your decision
either way.

A few hours.

I will leave you
to your thoughts.

Wait.

Thereâ€™s so much to think about.

How...

What?

Iâ€™m sorry for how quickly
this all came about.

I wish there was more time.

Can I call you tonight?

That would be perfect.


You seem angry about something.

Youâ€™re being foolish.

How is that?

Youâ€™re not thinking clearly.

Tara is the one.

I chose her myself.
You were happy with her.

Yes, but my heart
knew differently.

I cannot explain it.

So youâ€™ve said.

Youâ€™re being ridiculous.

Your time, my time

is almost over.

Iâ€™m aware of what could happen.

If Caleb decides
this is too much for him,

I will accept Tara as the one
and turn her tomorrow.

Why canâ€™t you do it now?

Why must you wait
till the last possible minute?

It is my decision.

I am aware
of the ramifications.

We die, too!

You know that, right?

This is not just about you.

I think you should calm down.

How am I supposed to calm down

when my lifeâ€™s in danger?

Caleb is a plaything.

Tara is the one.

Why?
Because you say she is?


Are you sure
you wanna go there?

Whatâ€™s the problem, guys?

Iâ€™m not afraid of you.

You do not want
to die now, do you?


Are you threatening me?

You initiated this,
and I will gladly finish it.


Back away.
Letâ€™s not lose our heads.

Logan, if Caleb is the one
that Jasin wants, let it be.

Jasin is willing to let us die
for a piece of meat.

Break it up.

Now.

This isnâ€™t over.

This canâ€™t be good.

He just needs to calm down.

Do you think he meant it--
it not being over?

Is-- Is he gonna try something?

I cannot be certain.

[answering machine beeps]

Hey, Jasin, itâ€™s Caleb.

Um, I just really
would like to see you.

Can you come over
when you get his?

Did I keep you waiting?

Were you out here
the whole time?

I was across town.

Serious?

Another perk of being a vampire.

Whatâ€™s wrong?

You have to invite me in.

Really?
I know.

Another very old vampire myth.

However, it is one of the few
we hybrids must follow.

But you were in my backyard.

That was outdoors.

It was not where you live.

I donâ€™t make the rules.

I invite you in.

Have you given
any more thought
to our earlier discussion?

I have,

but Iâ€™ve been
a little distracted.

Paul isnâ€™t answering his phone.

I think heâ€™s ignoring me.

Didnâ€™t you two have a fight?

You could say that,

but it seems
a little unlike him.

You havenâ€™t known him that long.

Maybe it is just like him.

So, about our
earlier conversation.

Thereâ€™s just so much
to consider.

What are your feelings
for me?

Itâ€™s funny.

Iâ€™ve never felt this way
about anyone,

ever.

I feel the same.

What about Tara?

If she truly were the one,
I would not be here right now.

Would you give yourself
to me freely?

I...

[knock at door]

Whatâ€™s going on?

Big trouble.
Thatâ€™s putting it mildly.

What are you both talking about?

Logan has completely lost it.

Whatâ€™s going on?
Hey, Caleb.

So, ready to become one of us?
Stay focused, Dane.

What has happened?
Whatâ€™s Logan done?
Logan has taken Tara.

He sent us to find you.
If you donâ€™t meet him
tonight in the meadow,

heâ€™s gonna kill her,
and heâ€™s gonna hunt you down
and kill you, too.

What? Wait.

No. Sorry, man. We donâ€™t have
enough time to explain.

Oh, you shouldâ€™ve seen him.

We couldnâ€™t stop him.
Heâ€™s more powerful
than either of us.

May they come in?

Yes, of course.
You can both come in.

Logan has taken this too far.
You shouldâ€™ve seen
the look in his eyes.

Oh, darker than normal.
I will not fight him
unless I must.

I cannot let him harm Tara.

Is he more powerful than you?
I donâ€™t wanna lose you.

I created Logan.

He was my first transformation.

He is a very powerful vampire.

He threw Adam through a tree.
It didnâ€™t hurt.

Stay focused, guys.

If he wants me to meet him,
so be it.

You must stay behind.

Bullshit.
Iâ€™m not staying here.

You are a stubborn one,
arenâ€™t you?

Damn straight.
I donâ€™t wanna lose you.

Donâ€™t worry, Jasin.

Weâ€™ll help protect him.

If we donâ€™t die
in the process.

I do not think that Logan
means to hurt Tara.

It is more than likely
a plot to get Caleb.

Caleb is the true target.

You must stay here.

So be it.


It does not have
to be this way.

Look what you did.

Poor Tara.

Sheâ€™s heartbroken.

I think sheâ€™s more frightened
of you at the moment.

I donâ€™t wanna die.

How can you choose him...

...over her?

Sheâ€™s so perfect and beautiful.

I can smell her blood.

Itâ€™s so sweet.

Maybe Iâ€™ll drain her
right here...

before I kill him.

Try to stay calm, Tara.
He will not harm you.

Donâ€™t count on it.



I donâ€™t want to kill you.

You donâ€™t have a choice.

Either you kill me

or Iâ€™ll kill him.

Then Iâ€™ll burn your body.


You caused this!
You caused this!


You leave me no choice.


Is she gonna be okay?

Her heartbeat is slowing.

She will be one of us
before the night is over.

Can I say the same for you?

As you can see,

I will do anything for you.

Will you die to live forever?

Will you die
to live forever with me?

Yes.

â™ª I, I like the way you,
way you taste, taste â™ª

â™ª And I like the way
you say my name, name â™ª

â™ª Ooh, baby, is this
a phase, phase â™ª

â™ª You got me wrapped up
in your chains like a slave â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª I â™ª

â™ª Canâ€™t wait

another sky-y â™ª

â™ª Donâ€™t make me
another victim of your crime â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª I â™ª

â™ª Canâ€™t wait
to take you tonight â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª Iâ€™m â™ª
