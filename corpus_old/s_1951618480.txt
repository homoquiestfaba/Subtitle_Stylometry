No, Lee used to drag me<i>:</i>

She made me quit fighting

What do you think of all this,

Well, for civic reasons,
I hope the LAPD is ridiculed

<i>formerly of Sioux Falls,</i>

No visible bruising

Eectangular abrasions

And, oh!
A puncture wound, here,

On the palm of the right hand<i>:</i>

Investigation of upper half
abdominal cavity reveals
no free-flowing blood<i>:</i>

Intestines, stomach,
spleen, liver, all removed<i>:</i>

Is it all right to smoke,
Doctor?

She won<i>'</i>t mind<i>:</i>

Lower half of cadaver
reveals removal
of all reproductive organs<i>:</i>

Both legs broken at the knee<i>:</i>

Questions<i>:</i>

What<i>'</i>s your best guess?
Well, here<i>'</i>s what she wasn<i>'</i>t,

she wasn<i>'</i>t raped
and she wasn<i>'</i>t pregnant<i>:</i>

In terms of the nitty-gritty,

the cause of death
is either the mouth wound here

or she was beaten to death
with something like
a baseball bat<i>:</i>

What about her insides?

They came out posthumously<i>:</i>

I say then he drained
the blood from the body

and washed it clean,
probably in a bathtub<i>:</i>

We would like to

Neither of you<i>'</i>d have lasted

You want to hear my alibi?

Betty came west in <i>'</i>43,

I promised her three squares
and a five-spot,
she kept the house tidy<i>:</i>

She live with you then?

I gave her the boot in July<i>:</i>

Moved to Santa Barbara<i>:</i>
Sent me a postcard

Some soldier

That<i>'</i>s the last

Keep your fucking panties on<i>:</i>

Was that soldier

They were all her boyfriends<i>:</i>

Any names, Mr<i>:</i> Short?

Look, Tom, Dick, Harry,
it don<i>'</i>t matter<i>:</i>

She said she was looking
for movie work,

Hollywood Boulevard

in those black get-ups

I mean, who wouldn<i>'</i>t get

Who wouldn<i>'</i>t?


We just got handed the entire

Hey, Johnson,

What do you want to do?

BUCkY: So, how do you want
to play this, Sarge?

Fritzie usually does
the talking<i>:</i>

Why don<i>'</i>t you let me
try and talk to her?

All right, first question,

does a Lorna Mertz
live here?

She used to<i>:</i>

She skipped town this morning<i>:</i>

But I<i>'</i>m holding this suitcase
till she ponies up
the back rent<i>:</i>

Is this it?

Miss Short moved around
quite a bit, too, didn<i>'</i>t she?

Was anybody threatening her?

Poor Betty<i>:</i>

Her problem wasn<i>'</i>t
too many enemies<i>:</i>

It was too many friends<i>:</i>

I gathered that<i>:</i>

Okay,
let<i>'</i>s change the subject<i>:</i>

All right<i>:</i>

How about the world
of high finance?

How about the movies?

You girls are all trying
to break in, right?

Darling, I<i>'</i>m in<i>:</i>

Congratulations<i>:</i>
How about Betty?

Maybe once<i>:</i>

Maybe not at all<i>:</i>

She came around
last Christmas,

bragging about
getting her big break<i>:</i>

Guess after all
those screen tests,
she finally got a part<i>:</i>

But,

she had a tendency to<i>: : :</i>

Stretch the truth?

No<i>:</i>

She fucking lied<i>:</i>

Do you know the names
of any of her boyfriends?

What is it?
You can tell me<i>:</i>

Well,

I do remember,
before she split,

her and Lorna<i>: : :</i>

Mertz?

Yeah<i>:</i> Her and Lorna Mertz<i>:</i>

I mean I don<i>'</i>t want to
tell any tales out of school

but I do remember them being
up on Hollywood Boulevard

speaking to this older woman<i>:</i>

And she,

she was wearing a man<i>'</i>s suit
and had a man<i>'</i>s short haircut<i>:</i>

But it was just that once<i>:</i>

Miss Saddon,
are you saying they
were talking to a lesbian?

Why don<i>'</i>t we take
a look inside Lorna<i>'</i>s bag,
and then maybe you can go<i>:</i>

<i>Are you looking for a girl</i>

<i>No, no: That's all right:</i>

Mister,
my father is Emmett Linscott<i>:</i>

He built half of Hollywood

<i>"</i>Footsie

So what<i>'</i>d you talk about?

When?

When you were playing footsie<i>:</i>

Lorna talked about her stupid
boyfriend back in Hicktown,
Nebraska, or wherever<i>:</i>

Betty talked about the latest
issue of <i>Screen World:</i>

Starlets, Hollywood dreams,
the whole sad nine yards<i>:</i>

So, did Betty ever tell you
about a movie she was in?

On a conversational level,
they were right up there
with you<i>:</i>

what do I have to do to keep

Maddy<i>'</i>s my pretty one,

What kind of a name
is Bleichert? Dutch?

German<i>:</i>

A great people, the Germans<i>:</i>

Hitler was a bit excessive<i>:</i>

But mark my words
that someday we<i>'</i>ll regret

not joining forces with him
to fight the Eeds<i>:</i>

You know,
I killed a lot of your
countrymen during the war<i>:</i>

Mr<i>:</i> Bleichert, have you
met Balto in the hallway?

Yes<i>:</i> Very realistic<i>:</i>

EMMETT: An old friend
stuffed him<i>:</i>

We were in the Scots Eegiment
together<i>:</i> Georgie Tilden<i>:</i>

He wanted to work
in the flickers<i>:</i>

When did you move here?

1920<i>:</i>

Hollywood was a cow pasture
but the silent flickers
were booming<i>:</i>

Georgie got work
as a lighting man,
me building houses<i>:</i>

Georgie introduced me
to Mack Sennett<i>:</i>

I helped him build
that housing project
he was putting up

underneath
that god-awful sign<i>:</i>

Hollywoodland<i>:</i>

I used to love
the <i>Keystone Kops:</i>

Me, too<i>:</i>

Old Mack knew how
to squeeze a dollar dry<i>:</i>

He had extras moonlighting
as laborers and vice versa<i>:</i>

Georgie and I used to drive
them over to Hollywoodland

after 12 hours
on a silent flicker<i>:</i>

Then put in another six hours
by torchlight<i>:</i>

He even gave us movie credits
a couple of times<i>:</i>

EMMETT: Mother<i>:</i>

Are you feeling well?

Would you like to contribute
to the conversation?

Did you know, Mr<i>:</i> Bleichert,

that Eamona Boulevard
is named after me?

I didn<i>'</i>t<i>:</i>

When Emmett married me,

for my father<i>'</i>s money,

he promised my family
that he would use
his influence

with the City Zoning Board

to have a street named
after me<i>:</i>

But all he could manage

was a dead-end block

in a red-light district

in Lincoln Heights<i>:</i>

Are you familiar with
the neighborhood,
Mr<i>:</i> Bleichert?

I grew up there<i>:</i>

Yes, well,

then you<i>'</i>ll know
that Mexican prostitutes

expose themselves
in windows<i>:</i>

I hear many of them
know Mr<i>:</i> Linscott by name<i>:</i>

That<i>'</i>s enough!

I will sing for my supper

when Mayor Bowron comes
to dinner,

but not

for Madeleine<i>'</i>s male whores<i>:</i>

He<i>'</i>s a common policeman<i>:</i>

My God, Emmett!

How little you think of me<i>:</i>


I<i>'</i>m sorry<i>:</i>
I<i>'</i>m really so sorry<i>:</i>

Mr<i>:</i> Bleichert<i>:</i>

(DOG BAEklNG)

BUCkY: You kept your name
out of the papers<i>:</i>

Until the wedding<i>:</i>

Your mother would love that<i>:</i>

She<i>'</i>s a snob<i>:</i>

The kind who takes pills
the doctor gives her

so she doesn<i>'</i>t have to admit
to being a hophead<i>:</i>

Do you want to know a secret?

Sure<i>:</i>

Daddy bought
rotten lumber

and old movie sets
from Mack Sennett

and built houses
out of them<i>:</i>

That<i>'</i>s how he really made
his money<i>:</i>

He<i>'</i>s got firetraps
all over L<i>:</i>A<i>:</i>

His good friend Georgie,
maimed in a car crash,

while running Daddy
some errands<i>:</i>

And now he throws him scraps,

odd jobs, tending
Daddy<i>'</i>s rental properties<i>:</i>

You don<i>'</i>t have
to tell me this<i>:</i>

I like you, Bucky<i>:</i>

I didn<i>'</i>t tell you
all about Betty<i>:</i>

You didn<i>'</i>t?

Don<i>'</i>t be mad at me<i>:</i>

Last summer, I heard about
a girl who looked like me<i>:</i>

I got curious<i>:</i>

I left notes
at a couple of places,

<i>"</i>Your look-alike
wants to meet you,<i>"</i>
things like that<i>:</i>

I left my number<i>:</i>

She called<i>:</i>

That<i>'</i>s how I met her
at LaVerne<i>'</i>s with Lorna<i>:</i>

And that<i>'</i>s all of it?

Yes<i>:</i>

Tell me something<i>:</i>

Why<i>'</i>d you want to meet
Betty Short anyway?

I<i>'</i>ve worked hard to be loose

but the way people
described Betty

it was like she was a natural<i>:</i>

<i>"Don't walk out on me,</i>
<i>Richard:</i>

<i>"Say you care:</i>
<i>Say that you: : : "</i>

<i>MAN: Miss Short:</i>

<i>There is a pause</i>
<i>after "care":</i>

<i>Are you familiar</i>
<i>with the English language?</i>

<i>I try to be:</i>

<i>Okay:</i>

<i>Let's try it again:</i>

<i>And remember,</i>
<i>go back to the beginning,</i>
<i>you're begging him:</i>

<i>Begging:</i>

<i>He's walking out on you:</i>

<i>You're begging him:</i>

<i>So, come on, let's do it:</i>

<i>We're running out of</i>
<i>film here: Let's go:</i>

<i>Richard,</i>
<i>don't walk out on me:</i>

<i>Please say that you care:</i>

<i>Say that you think</i>
<i>that I'm beautiful,</i>

<i>and that you love me:</i>

<i>Miss Short, you know,</i>
<i>this is a very sad scene:</i>

<i>Do you think you're capable</i>
<i>of playing sadness?</i>

<i>Sure:</i>

<i>I can do that:</i>

Keep your hands
where I can see them<i>:</i>

Jesus<i>:</i>

I ain<i>'</i>t out one week, and<i>: : :</i>

You<i>'</i>re here for a drug deal
with Morrie Friedman<i>:</i>
I know that<i>:</i>

Look, I<i>'</i>m just looking
for a place to take a piss<i>:</i>

Lee Blanchard<i>'</i>s here<i>:</i>
Did you know that?
Blanchard?

Man-oh-Manischewitz,
I ain<i>'</i>t seen Blanchard
since my fucking trial<i>:</i>

Yeah,
but he<i>'</i>s been on your mind<i>:</i>

And you<i>'</i>ve been on his mind<i>:</i>

I<i>'</i>m thinking that you let
the word out there knowing
he<i>'</i>d come down here<i>:</i>

Look, maybe
I flapped my trap at trial<i>:</i>
Maybe I was thinking revenge,

maybe talking trash
to my cellies,

but all I know is
what I read in the papers,

and when that fucker
killed them niggers<i>: : :</i>

Finish up<i>:</i>

I don<i>'</i>t know
what his version is<i>:</i>
What<i>'</i>s your version?

Sir, all this between
me and Blanchard

is that I fucked this
big-tittied Dakota cunt
named kay Lake<i>: : :</i>

MAN: Hold it, pal<i>:</i>

(GUN FIEING)

Blanchard, behind you!

BUCkY: Blanchard!

(LEE SCEEAMING)


No!

Here<i>:</i>

My apologies,
Officer Bleichert<i>:</i>

My men are instructed
not to take any chances,
and you did have a gun<i>:</i>

The guy
with the choke rope,

I assume DeWitt brought him
for muscle<i>:</i>

No identification,
nothing left of his face
after he hit the fountain<i>:</i>

You understand why we must
handle things like this, huh?

It<i>'</i>s your building<i>:</i>

Uh-huh<i>:</i>

Come on<i>:</i> Bring him in<i>:</i>
Get him in here<i>:</i>

Officer?

See what we got here?

I can<i>'</i>t think of another way,
can you?

Come here<i>:</i>

Come on<i>:</i>

Come<i>:</i>

Want to say something?

Fire and Ice<i>:</i>

Fire and Ice<i>:</i>

FEIEDMAN: Excuse me?

Nothing<i>:</i>

Just do it quick<i>:</i>

What happened?
What happened?

What happened?
What happened?

<i>BUCKY: Stolen witness reports,</i>

<i>medical records,</i>
<i>autopsy photos:</i>

<i>Lee had turned his life</i>
<i>inside out</i>

<i>and my dad's apartment</i>
<i>into the Black Dahlia's</i>
<i>House of Horrors:</i>

<i>I confessed</i>
<i>to the only priest I needed:</i>

How long have you known
about this?

I don<i>'</i>t know<i>:</i>

Why show me now?

I don<i>'</i>t know<i>:</i>

He<i>'</i>s not coming back,
is he, Buck?

Stupid son of a bitch,

getting himself killed
over a little mope
like Bobby DeWitt<i>:</i>

Damn<i>:</i>

Did you tell kay?

Well, that<i>'</i>s as far
as it goes, then<i>:</i>

Mo Friedman was right<i>:</i>

Our boy doesn<i>'</i>t need
any more headlines<i>:</i>
Neither does kay<i>:</i>

This<i>: : :</i>

I want you to
stick with me here<i>:</i>

We are going to make
something of this<i>:</i>

<i>MAN: What's a sexy girl</i>
<i>like you so sad about?</i>

<i>Nothing:</i>

<i>You've got tears</i>
<i>running down your face:</i>
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

<i>Just a bad day:</i>

<i>It's all right:</i>
<i>You must have a lot of fun:</i>

<i>You look like you have</i>
<i>a hell of a lot of fun:</i>
<i>Oh, I sure do:</i>

<i>I'm a fun-Ioving gal:</i>

<i>You got any special guys</i>
<i>that you, you know: : :</i>

<i>I have a fiancé:</i>

<i>Yeah, I met him in Florida:</i>

<i>And it was one</i>
<i>of those things that was: : :</i>

<i>Gosh, I don't know</i>
<i>if you've experienced</i>
<i>this before,</i>

<i>but it was love</i>
<i>at first sight:</i>

<i>Yeah, I get it</i>
<i>about five times a night:</i>

<i>(MAN LAUGHING)</i>

<i>That's what it was:</i>

<i>He asked me to marry him</i>
<i>that night:</i>

<i>And then, the next day,</i>
<i>he was just gone:</i>

<i>Well, that "ask you</i>
<i>to marry him" always works:</i>

<i>No, he promised</i>
<i>he'd come back:</i>

<i>He was an Air Force captain,</i>
<i>which is why he had to leave:</i>
<i>He went overseas:</i>

<i>And you know</i>
<i>what he used to do?</i>

<i>He used to write me</i>

<i>such beautiful, florid,</i>
<i>romantic love letters:</i>

<i>Oh, a poet:</i>

<i>Just a decent guy:</i>

<i>So, what happened</i>
<i>to Prince Charming?</i>

<i>Well, the night that</i>
<i>he was supposed to come back,</i>

<i>he was called to</i>
<i>do one last mission</i>

<i>and his plane crashed</i>

<i>over India:</i>

<i>And now he's dead:</i>

<i>Boy, you sure know</i>
<i>how to tell a funny story:</i>

<i>Yeah, I sure do:</i>

<i>(ELIZABETH LAUGHING)</i>

<i>Okay: Should I read</i>
<i>into the camera?</i>

<i>Yeah:</i>

<i>Okay:</i>

<i>I'm told that</i>
<i>I'm very photogenic:</i>

(PHONE EINGING)

I<i>'</i>m collating the kA update

Anything new
you need him to add?

No<i>:</i>

Dolph<i>'</i>s tonight?

I<i>'</i>m going to kay<i>'</i>s<i>:</i>

Wednesday nights
were the nights she<i>'</i>d make
Lee and me a big dinner, so<i>: : :</i>

We haven<i>'</i>t done it since<i>:</i>

We<i>'</i>re going to try<i>:</i>

Should we say something?

We haven<i>'</i>t said anything<i>:</i>

To my supercops<i>:</i>

I feel like I haven<i>'</i>t said
anything right<i>:</i>

Haven<i>'</i>t done anything right<i>:</i>

There<i>'</i>s nothing to say<i>:</i>

There is<i>:</i>

There is<i>:</i>

He saved my life<i>:</i>

He saved my life,
and I saw him there
and I couldn<i>'</i>t<i>: : :</i>

Dwight<i>:</i>

I couldn<i>'</i>t move<i>:</i>

I couldn<i>'</i>t move<i>:</i>

I didn<i>'</i>t move<i>:</i>

I never move<i>:</i> I<i>'</i>m sorry<i>:</i>
I<i>'</i>m so sorry<i>:</i> I<i>'</i>m sorry<i>:</i>

Kay, I<i>'</i>m sorry<i>:</i>

I<i>'</i>m sorry<i>:</i>

I could<i>'</i>ve saved him<i>:</i>
I could<i>'</i>ve saved him<i>:</i>

<i>"</i>Shoddy home construction?<i>"</i>

I cut my foot
on a bathroom tile<i>:</i>

You got it in you
to replace a few?

Yeah, of course<i>:</i>


Dwight<i>:</i>

Dwight<i>:</i>

I<i>'</i>d always wondered
where he kept it<i>:</i>

Were you ever
going to tell me?

He<i>'</i>d given all his money
to Ben Siegel and he<i>: : :</i>

He wanted to buy us a home<i>:</i>

I didn<i>'</i>t know
there was any left<i>:</i>

Were you ever
going to tell me?

Something<i>'</i>s burning<i>:</i>

Bobby did do
the bank job, Dwight<i>:</i>
Don<i>'</i>t get the wrong idea<i>:</i>

I don<i>'</i>t know
what kind of idea
I got right now<i>:</i>

Things were getting really
bad between me and Bobby,
and I had to get out<i>:</i>

I knew this guy that Bobby
made me be with once<i>:</i>

He was a hophead
who let it slip

that he sometimes snitched
to the cops for dope money<i>:</i>

And that<i>'</i>s how you met Lee?

I told him what Bobby was
doing to me, how he cut me
and pimped me to his friends

and I told him about
the bank job and where
Bobby was hiding the money<i>:</i>

And then last year,
the guy<i>: : :</i>

The hophead?

Yeah<i>:</i>

Lee had given him $1,000
for introducing us<i>:</i>

He found out
that Bobby was getting out,

and he threatened to tell him
that we stole from him<i>:</i>

He wanted money that
we didn<i>'</i>t have, Dwight<i>:</i>

He wanted $10,000<i>:</i>

What were we going to do?

Promise me, promise me
you<i>'</i>ll forgive him
for DeWitt<i>:</i>

Forgive him
for the bank<i>:</i> Please<i>:</i>
It doesn<i>'</i>t matter to us<i>:</i>

What was the guy<i>'</i>s name?
It doesn<i>'</i>t matter<i>:</i>

Kay, tell me the guy<i>'</i>s name<i>:</i>

It was Baxter Fitch<i>:</i>

<i>BUCKY: Baxter Fitch,</i>
<i>and then DeWitt:</i>

<i>Lee killed them both</i>
<i>and took the bank money,</i>

<i>making me witness, stooge,</i>

<i>weak point</i>
<i>in a fairy tale triangle:</i>

KAY: You<i>'</i>re so good
at some things<i>:</i>

Dwight, he loved you<i>:</i>
He loved both of us,
Dwight, so much<i>:</i>

This had nothing
to do with us, Dwight!
Nothing! Don<i>'</i>t run out on us!

<i>BUCKY: The basic rule</i>
<i>of homicide applied:</i>

<i>Nothing stays buried forever:</i>

<i>Corpses: Ghosts:</i>

<i>Nothing stays buried forever:</i>
<i>Nothing:</i>

Family<i>'</i>s in Laguna<i>:</i>

But you know that<i>:</i>
You<i>'</i>ve been watching<i>:</i>

<i>Lee and Kay had lived in sin,</i>

<i>not because their shack job</i>
<i>was against department regs</i>

<i>but because the ghosts</i>
<i>of their past had forced them</i>
<i>to choose love over passion:</i>

<i>The veneer of a fairy tale,</i>

<i>only a band-aid</i>
<i>to cover a fractured life:</i>

<i>I didn't believe</i>
<i>in fairy tales:</i>

<i>It was a reunion</i>
<i>of avowed tramps,</i>

<i>old rutters who knew</i>
<i>they'd never have it</i>
<i>as good with anybody else:</i>

<i>MARTHA: Have you met</i>
<i>Balto in the hallway?</i>

<i>EMMETT: An old friend</i>
<i>stuffed him:</i>

<i>We were in the Scots Regiment</i>
<i>together: Georgie Tilden:</i>

<i>He wanted to work</i>
<i>in the flickers:</i>

What?

Nothing<i>:</i>

You miss them?

Mother<i>'</i>s insults?
Martha<i>'</i>s pornography?

I just never imagined
Georgie so<i>: : :</i>

The way your father
described him<i>:</i>

Different<i>:</i>

They were young<i>:</i>

He died last year<i>:</i> Angina<i>:</i>

Daddy paid to have him
buried at the family plot
in Scotland<i>:</i>

That<i>'</i>s very nice of him<i>:</i>

BUCkY: I don<i>'</i>t get modern art<i>:</i>

I doubt modern art
gets you, either<i>:</i>

But I do<i>:</i>

Kay, what the hell
are you doing here?

What am I doing here?

How could you?
How could you?

You follow me here,
after what you<i>'</i>ve done?

What have I done? Nothing!
You lied to me!

I lied for you!
I lied for us!

What could I do but lie,
Dwight?

You could have
told me the truth<i>:</i>

She looks like
that dead girl!

How sick are you?

You<i>'</i>re going to end up
like Lee<i>:</i> You will<i>:</i>

But I will not<i>:</i>

(CAE DOOE CLOSING)

(CAE ENGINE STAETING)

<i>KAY: She looks like that</i>
<i>dead girl! How sick are you?</i>

<i>You're going to end up</i>
<i>like Lee:</i>

<i>BUCKY: The set</i>
<i>was enough to tie</i>
<i>Linscott to the porno movie,</i>

<i>but not to the murder:</i>

<i>For that, I needed</i>
<i>to stop worrying about</i>
<i>who killed the Dahlia</i>

<i>and focus on where:</i>

<i>EMMETT: Georgie</i>
<i>introduced me to Mack Sennett:</i>

<i>I helped him build</i>
<i>that housing project</i>
<i>he was putting up</i>

<i>underneath</i>
<i>that god-awful sign:</i>

<i>MARTHA: Hollywoodland:</i>

<i>BUCKY: Lorna Mertz said</i>
<i>it was shot out of town:</i>

<i>People lie:</i>

<i>CORONER:</i>
<i>Oh, a puncture wound</i>
<i>in the palm of the hand:</i>

(WATEE FLOWING)

<i>I say then he drained</i>
<i>the blood from the body</i>
<i>and washed it clean:</i>

MADELEINE: I don<i>'</i>t
want to go to Europe<i>:</i>

EMMETT: One of my foremen
said the goddamn pipes
are spewing gas<i>:</i>

There<i>'</i>ll be hell to pay<i>:</i>

It<i>'</i>s about time I showed
the three of you good old
Scotland<i>:</i>

I don<i>'</i>t want to go
to Europe, Daddy<i>:</i>

You<i>'</i>re always talking
about how dreadful
and provincial it is<i>:</i>

Yeah, but it<i>'</i>s got
what you need, lassie<i>:</i>

What is that, Emmett?

Saps like me?

Or is that what you needed?

Oh, laddie<i>:</i>

You killed Elizabeth Short,

and the two of you
covered it up<i>:</i>

You made that stag film
with Lorna and Betty<i>:</i>

I<i>'</i>ve seen the set<i>:</i>

I found it all<i>:</i>
Put that gun down, laddie<i>:</i>

You<i>'</i>re not the shooting type
and I<i>'</i>m not the dying type<i>:</i>

(MADELEINE SCEEAMS)

You might be half right<i>:</i>

Jesus Christ, Bleichert<i>:</i>
That<i>'</i>s a Ming<i>:</i>

Great<i>:</i> Let<i>'</i>s talk art<i>:</i>

Let<i>'</i>s talk <i>The Man Who Laughs:</i>
I<i>'</i>ve seen the movie<i>:</i>

I<i>'</i>ve got you<i>:</i>

So you don<i>'</i>t
like my taste in art<i>:</i>

I don<i>'</i>t think
that<i>'</i>s a crime<i>:</i>

Stop! Georgie did it!

Oh, that<i>'</i>s rich<i>:</i>

Blame it on the poor,
dead gardener<i>:</i>

No, Bucky<i>:</i> It<i>'</i>s true<i>:</i>
Believe him<i>:</i>

Georgie was always sneaking
around Daddy<i>'</i>s properties<i>:</i>

He saw them make the movie
and he got crazy about Betty<i>:</i>

More<i>:</i>

There are so many
pretty things here, Emmett<i>:</i>

All right<i>:</i>

Betty called,
short of cash, as usual<i>:</i>

I put Daddy on
and he offered her money
to date a nice man he knew<i>:</i>

You must<i>'</i>ve known
he was a sick fuck then<i>:</i>

Well, he was passive<i>:</i>
I mean, he liked
to touch dead things<i>:</i>

I mean,
his father was a surgeon<i>:</i>

Did you know that?
Famous in Scotland<i>:</i>

We didn<i>'</i>t know
he<i>'</i>d go crazy like that<i>:</i>

EAMONA: Liar!

Liar!

You did him enough damage,
Emmett<i>:</i> Now you let him go!

I would appreciate it
if you just stopped shooting
things, Officer, though<i>:</i>

The rich don<i>'</i>t own art
just for themselves<i>:</i>

We safe keep it
for future generations<i>:</i>

How did Emmett damage Georgie?

What did he do
to make him go so crazy?

Who made what made who crazy?

It was Madeleine<i>:</i>

She was 11 years old,

and she looked
just like Georgie<i>:</i>

Eamona!

Shut up, Emmett!

That<i>'</i>s right, Officer<i>:</i>
George and me<i>:</i>

Not that Emmett cared
about that<i>:</i>

But he was her father<i>:</i>

And for that,

he ruined George<i>'</i>s face<i>:</i>

When he got out of hospital,

I gave him the Hugo book
as a present<i>:</i>

He had worked construction
on that movie with Emmett<i>:</i>

It was always
one of his favorites<i>:</i>

That<i>'</i>s right<i>:</i> My book<i>:</i>

My picture<i>:</i> My Gwynplaine<i>:</i>

What about Betty Short?

Well, that was
the cruelest joke of all<i>:</i>

He was obsessed with her,
you know, that filthy film!

<i>BUCKY: And your husband</i>
<i>bought her for Georgie:</i>

He<i>'</i>s a shy wee lad,
but l<i>: : :</i>

It<i>'</i>d make him very happy,
I think, if you<i>'</i>d take him
out on a wee date<i>:</i>

<i>BUCKY: What did you do,</i>
<i>Ramona?</i>

<i>RAMONA: I was</i>

<i>waiting up in Hollywoodland:</i>

Oh, gosh<i>:</i>


It was the second swing,

woke her up<i>:</i>

<i>She looked so like my Maddy:</i>

<i>It was</i>

<i>the cruelest joke of all:</i>

(EAMONA CHUCkLING)

We<i>'</i>ll ruin you in court<i>:</i>
You know that<i>:</i>

Over what? Some little slut?

(EAMONA GEOANS)

<i>BUCKY: It was</i>
<i>neat enough for the papers,</i>
<i>but that didn't make it clean:</i>

<i>The rich lived differently:</i>
<i>I guess they get</i>
<i>to die differently, too:</i>

Hello, Officer Bleichert<i>:</i>

Did you come to pay your
respects or fuck my sister?

I came to talk to you
about Lee Blanchard<i>:</i>

He came here, didn<i>'</i>t he?
Asking about your sister
and the Dahlia?

Tell me<i>:</i>

<i>Adios</i> yourself back
to the Halls of Tripoli,
shitbird<i>:</i>

I<i>'</i>ve got business
with the lady<i>:</i>

Bucky<i>:</i>

Lee knew everything about you
and Elizabeth Short<i>:</i>

He knew everything,
didn<i>'</i>t he?

I don<i>'</i>t know
what you<i>'</i>re saying<i>:</i>

I went by your house today<i>:</i>
I talked to your sister,
Martha<i>:</i>

She told me that a policeman
named Lee Blanchard came by
the house

asking questions about
you and Elizabeth Short<i>:</i>

She told him that
the two of you were close<i>:</i>

Martha was always
jealous of me<i>:</i>

He was blackmailing
your father<i>:</i>

No<i>:</i> I beat up a wall<i>:</i>
For messing up Nash<i>: : :</i>

So,

on the night that
he went to the Olympic
to settle an old score

<i>you tracked him there:</i>
<i>Like a dog:</i>

I<i>'</i>ve been pointing my gun
at a lot of people this week<i>:</i>

I haven<i>'</i>t had a chance
to shoot anybody yet<i>:</i>

What do you think?

I think you<i>'</i>d rather fuck me
than kill me,

but you don<i>'</i>t have
the guts to do either<i>:</i>

You<i>'</i>re a boxer, not a fighter<i>:</i>

You<i>'</i>re a murderer<i>:</i>

Of my partner<i>:</i>

A murderer?

Of Lee Blanchard?

You should thank me
for Lee Blanchard<i>:</i>

If it weren<i>'</i>t for me,

you wouldn<i>'</i>t
have had the balls

to fuck your partner<i>'</i>s girl<i>:</i>

You don<i>'</i>t talk
about them, okay?

Wait<i>:</i> I forgot<i>:</i>

You don<i>'</i>t fuck her anymore

because you<i>'</i>d rather
fuck me<i>:</i>

You don<i>'</i>t talk about them<i>:</i>

You chose me over her<i>:</i>

You<i>'</i>ll choose me over him<i>:</i>

He was going to take
Daddy<i>'</i>s money and leave,

leave all of you<i>:</i>

You<i>'</i>d never shoot me<i>:</i>

Don<i>'</i>t forget who I look like<i>:</i>

Because that girl,

that sad, dead bitch,

she<i>'</i>s all you have<i>:</i>

No<i>:</i>

<i>BUCKY: Madeleine was wrong:</i>
<i>I had others:</i>

<i>Ones I'd loved</i>
<i>and ones who'd loved me:</i>

<i>People I'd betrayed and people</i>
<i>I needed to protect:</i>

<i>And, for the first time</i>
<i>in my life,</i>

<i>I had people that knew that,</i>
<i>for the briefest of times,</i>

<i>in the darkest of places,</i>

<i>I had been so,</i>
<i>so good at some things:</i>
