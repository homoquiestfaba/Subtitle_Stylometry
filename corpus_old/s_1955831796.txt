GIRL: No, no, no, no.

I said I was sorry.

Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

Sorry. I'm sorry.

Okay, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I said I was sorry.

And I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm--I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. Sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I-I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I-I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I...

[ crickets chirping ]

GIRL: You disgusting bitch.

No. No. No. No.

[ splash ]

[ cheering ]

Yeah, Nicole!

Yeah, get it!

Whoo!

Kristen, I'm looking at you.

All right, come on.
You're up new girl.

Let's see what you got.

No, I--I don't have
a swimsuit.

Don't be lame.
It's just your undies.

Whoa, we don't have
all night, losers!

Come on.
Show us what's under there.

Come on. Just--

No, okay,
I'll go if you stop that.

Come on. What?
[ laughs ]

Here she goes.

[ cheering ]

Yeah!

[ cheering ]

[ music playing ]

[ screams ]

[ overlapping chatter ]

Sorry.
It's a little too back.

No, keep going.

Yeah.

Oh, I just--
Come on.

Ah.
Come on.

You can't hang, Nicole.
Face facts.

That's a fact, punk. Gah.

Unh. Yeah. Yeah.

[ laughs ]

Gotta take a photo of this one.

No, no, no. Okay, all right.

Get ready for your punishment.

Punish me. Punish me, baby.
I'm cool with that.

Careful what you wish for.

Do you guys
have a bottle opener?

[ laughing ]
It's a twist-off.

What is this, your first party?

[ bottle cap clinks ]

[ laughs ]

[ girl laughs ]

Hey, girl, isn't this
the most epic night ever?

Yes.

We have to document this.

[ camera clicks ]

Perf. I'm posting it.

[ chuckles ]

Ah, you've discovered Jake.

Hey, Jake.

Shh.

What?

Come play quarters
with me and new girl.

She's got the hots for you.
[ laughs ]

Thanks, but I--
I gotta head home.

She'll make it
worth your while.

Sorry. She's an idiot.

I know.

Hey, rain check, definitely.

Screw Jake.
We'll have our own fun.

Come on. Let's rage.

[ piano music playing ]

[ crickets chirping ]

[ cell phone chimes ]

[ camera clicks ]

Mm, take another shot.

[ laughs ]

Oop.

[ chuckles ]
Dang.

Cheers.

Ah.

[ sighs ]

[ coughs ]

Hey, you know
my friend Amber, right?

She goes to Sacred Heart.

[ panting ]

No. Why?

It's just I've called and
texted her a bunch of times,

and she hasn't responded
in, like, 10 days.

That's weird.

I know.

It's starting
to freak me out a little bit.

I'm gonna look her up
on Facebook.

I don't know.

Hmm.

"Found an old friend
still online, sent her a note.

Dare you to do the same."

What the hell?

[ laughs ]

Oh, my God. No way.

Dude, her profile is still up.

[ scoffs ] No way.

Who is that?

Morgan Rose.

She, uh,
went to our middle school,

was the biggest
freak whore ever. God.

We're back.

Let's see
how bad Amber burned her.

[ laughing ]
Oh, my God.

Dude, that is, like,
so fucked up.

Damn.

We have to do it, too. Okay.

[ typing ]
Mm...

Take that, bitch.

Your turn.

Light her up.

I could never top that.

Okay, look,

school is starting,
and we need to show

these underclass bitches
who runs shit, 'kay?

Consider this practice.

And trust me, she deserves it.

But...

Go on.

Dude, you're, like,
really good at this.

Oh, my God.

I can't post that. That's...

You did it. I'm proud of you.

[ laughs ]

Come on.
Let's take another shot.

[ birds chirping ]

[ dog barking ]

[ sighs ]

[ sighs ]

Oh, no.

I think
we can stop pretending.

I know you flirt with boys
on the computer

and stay out 'til 4 A.M.

Sorry if I woke you up
last night.

Sorry?

It's your senior year.

I want you to have fun.

Um...

hey, are you sure
I can't go with you?

The old house
already sold, honey.

We're just going to sign
some papers.

This is home now.

[ knock on door ]

Hey, girls.

[ laughs ]
Hi.

Jane, the cab's here.

Oh.

Okay, sweetie, we'll call
when we get to Grandma's?

Okay.
Okay, and I left you money--

On the counter, yeah,

and you left food in the fridge.

And you left me
all the phone numbers,

even though I have them
on my phone...

I know.
as well as my email.

We're dinosaurs, I know. Bye.

Hey, no parties.

[ footsteps ]

Maybe one party.

Little one. You know,

somebody needs
to break the place in.

Okay. [ laughs ]

[ chime ]

[ laughing ]

[ school bell rings ]

[ overlapping chatter ]

[ P.A. squeals ]

Welcome back,

and let's give a big warm
Jefferson High welcome

to all of our new students.

Morning.

Isn't this awesome?

My God, you're a huge hit.

I've gotten, like,
a million texts about you.

No, no, I--

Are you serious, 'cause--

Oh, my God, please, 'kay?

Haters gonna hate.
It's no big deal.

Okay.
You're on my team now, okay?

You look nice.

Thanks.

We'll work on yours. [ laughs ]

My mom gave me this skirt.

I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

Um, hey, this is
totally random. Uh--

Yeah?

Why did Amber want us
to burn that girl so bad?

Just cause. Okay?

I tried to delete
the comments,

because I felt really--

Kristen,
you're so paranoid. God.

Yeah,
but that's the weird part.

I actually couldn't do it.
Okay, and it just--

Just listen. Drop it already.

Hot senior chicks.

How does it feel to be on top?

I don't know.
Feels pretty awesome, right?

Yeah.
I mean, almost as awesome

as the end
of my party was, loser.

Mm, I'm the loser, huh?
Mm-hmm.

I mean, it was pretty awesome.

I mean,
you're welcome for that, Nicole.

Jake.
Hmm?

I don't know.
Why don't you try being cool

and show the new girl to class?

Have fun.

So, uh,
I saw the pics from the party.

Don't worry about it.
But it's--

You weren't doing anything
that embarrassing.

[ school bell rings ]

Maybe I can show you
around town sometime.

Just message me.

Yeah, o-okay.

Um, my--my Twitter is KriiisTEN,

but it has like,
three Is in it,

and then the--
the last three letters,

they're capitalized.

I should just ask Nicole
for your number.

Yeah, just do that.

Thanks.
Uh, your class...

Yeah.
is right there.

Duh.
Yeah.

[ both chuckle ]

Yeah.
Thanks.

Okay, hit me up.
Okay.

[ chuckles ]

â™ª ...verses,
check this â™ª

â™ª Hey

â™ª Boys my age
are still kinda geeky â™ª

â™ª Too much forward,
that's a little creepy â™ª

â™ª I wanna find somebody
with something he can teach me â™ª

â™ª Looking for a perfect 17

â™ª 19 wants to get
too freaky... â™ª

â™ª On a scale of one to ten,
I'd say what I like in men â™ª

â™ª Looking for a perfect 17

[ static crackling ]

What the heck?

Nicole.
[ gasps ]

Dad, what the fuck?
You scared me.

[ scoffs ]

I need to tell you something.

What's wrong?

It's about your friend Amber.

[ crickets chirping ]

Hey.

Come on.

I'm so sorry.

I should have known
something was wrong.

I should have noticed something.

No, don't, okay?

Don't blame yourself.
It is not your fault.

It just
doesn't make any sense.

Okay, Amber was the last person
to have ever--

She would--She would have
never done anything like that.

You heard what they said
about her, right?

That she just went insane.

Like hearing voices, insane,

saying that somebody
was gonna hurt her.

Amber wasn't afraid of anybody.

How did--How'd she die?

Her dad left her alone
for, like, five minutes

so he could
go sign some paperwork

to have her admitted
into an insane asylum.

When he was pulling
back into the driveway,

she jumped off the roof and...

landed headfirst
onto his windshield.

Like, what would
make her do that?

What would make her do that?

[ bird squawking ]

[ chime ]

[ whirring ]

[ screams ]

[ screams ]

[ screams ]

[ screams ]

[ screams ]

Is there somebody in here?

I'm gonna call the cops!

Hey...

can you come over?

Yeah, right now.

[ sighs ]
I checked the whole house.

There's no one in there,

and there are no cameras.
All the doors are locked.

Can I see this video?

No.

My computer
just, like, fried afterwards.

I can't even turn it on.

What do you think's happening?

Honestly, I think it's
just a weird glitch, you know?

Did you know her, Morgan?

Amber and Nicole
went to middle school

with Morgan at St. Francis.

They said she was different,

didn't get along
with the other kids.

She left school
in eighth grade,

and a few weeks later, they
found out she killed herself.

Everyone who went to St. Francis

made clear
you just don't talk about it.

Wait. Then, who's doing this?

I mean, who's running
her profile?

I don't know, but you
really shouldn't worry about it.

I mean, just stay off-line
for a while. It'll go away.

Come on. Let's get out of here.

Where do you want to go?

Um, we could see a movie.

I'll bet you
"Hunger Games 15" is out by now.

[ chuckles ]

Or we could throw
another party.

No. Definitely not.

Seriously, after cleaning up
Nicole's house,

yeah, I'd rather see
"Hunger Games 1000."

[ laughs ]

Let's go.

Come on.

Seat belt.

Ha ha. You wish.

You're reckless.

Just a little bit.

[ cell phone ringtone plays ]

So I guess, um,
Jake's been hanging out

with your girl Kristen a lot.

Yeah, it seems like it.

Hey, do you think
he really likes her,

or he's just sprung up
on her right now?

Honestly, um, I don't know.

It's hard to read that kid.

How 'bout you, though?

How you been holding up?

Not so great.

Definitely not
getting any sleep tonight.

Listen, um, I know that you
and Amber were close,

and I just
wanted to let you know,

if you need anything,
I'm here for you.

Thanks, but it's okay.

I just--

Well, I just want to feel
back to normal, you know?

Yeah, I get it.

You want to see
one of my latest videos?

Well, I mean, if you insist.

Um, okay,
I'm gonna send you a link.

Watch it, and let me know
what you think, okay?

Okay.
Okay.

GIRLS: Oh, pick me!
Pick me!

[ girls chattering ]
[ grunting ]

[ laughing ] Oh, my God.

Ah? Ah?

[ laughs ] I told you.

See? I told you
it would make you feel better.

Thanks. I needed that.

[ laughs ]

I--I think I know
how you can repay me.

Oh, yeah? How?

Send me a sexy pic,

like old times.

I don't know.

I'm not really in the mood.

Come on.

Seriously...

just one, to help you sleep.

It'll make you feel better.

Clint.
Good night.

Clint, hold up.

[ garbled audio ]

H-Hold on.

[ beeps ]

Okay.

[ owl hoots ]

[ camera whirs ]

[ camera whirs ]

[ crackling ]

[ screams ]

Oh, my God!

[ screams ]

[ panting ]

[ gasps ]

What?

[ buzzing ]

[ buzzing continues ]

What?

[ buzzing fades ]

In the witch hunts
of the 1600s,

victims were targeted
for many reasons.

Some were denounced
by a personal enemy.

Others were singled out,

because they seemed strange.

And some were targeted, simply
because they were vulnerable.

All right, pop quiz.

Everybody, pencils out.

Hey, hey, does your test
say anything about, um--

No cheating.

No, but, like,
does your test say--

I said no cheating!

[ screams ] Oh, my God!

Cheating bitch!

[ screams ]
[ class yelling ]

Get her! Get her!

[ screaming ]

Oh, my God!

[ gasping ]

[ class murmuring ]
What's wrong with her?

Nicole!

It's okay.

NICOLE: Oh, my God!

You're okay.

[ laughter ]
Shh.

What--What is going on?

Everybody, stop laughing!

Someone call the school nurse.

Oh, my God! Help me!

[ school bell rings ]

Oh, I'm kinda busy.

I want to go to have, um--
I'm gonna sign up for band.

Oh, okay, yeah.

Um, I have
one homework to do.

How are you doing in--

[ scrape ]

[ chime ]

Is someone there?

Is someone there?

[ panting ]

[ projector whirring ]

Who's there?

Uh...

Come on.

It's not funny.

[ screams ]
[ screams ]

[ panting ]

[ cell phone buzzes ]

[ breathing deeply ]

[ girl laughing ]

[ laughter fades ]

[ voices whispering ]

[ whispering fades ]

[ laughter resumes ]

Hello?

[ faint scream ]

No. [ panting ]

Go away. No. [ panting ]

Go away.

No. [ panting ] Go away.

[ panting ] Go away.

[ panting ] Go away.

[ screams ] No.

[ scream repeating ]

[ panting ] Go away.

[ panting ] Go away.

Go away.

[ screams ]

No. [ panting ]

Go away.
Oh, my God.

[ screams ]

No. [ panting ] Go away.

No. [ panting ]

Go away.

No. [ panting ] Go away.

[ panting ]

Go away.

[ panting ] Go away.

[ screams ]

Oh, my God.

[ gasping ]

[ scratching ]

[ screams ]

[ line ringing ]

Pick up. Pick up.
Pick up. Pick up.

[ line beeping ]

Damn, Nicky.

Nicky?

Hey, it's me! Where are you?

[ thump ]

[ door creaking ]

Nicky!

[ distant scream ]

Come on.

Come on. Open up. It's me.

[ voices whispering ]

Nicky?

[ slam ]

[ creaking ]

Don't let her open it!

Put it down.
What are you doing?

Put it down. Put it down.

She's in there
just waiting for us.

Nicky, stop. Put it down.

She'll never
let you take it back.

She'll never leave you alone
until you just break!

This is the only way out,
Kristen.

It's the only way I can do it.
Stop. Stop.

Stop! Nicky, stop!

[ screams ]
Stop! Stop!

[ overlapping chatter ]

[ dispatch radio chatter ]

[ sobbing ]

I just, um--

I don't believe it, you know?

You shouldn't be here.

You shouldn't be here.

This doesn't make sense.

Everyone thought
it was because of...

that video or Amber...

and that she
couldn't deal with it.

But there was something else,

something she wouldn't tell me.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

You're Kristen Shaw?

Yes.

I'm Detective Preston.

Look, I know this is
about the last thing

you wanna talk about right now,
but I have to ask you.

I already told your partner
everything that I know.

Did Nicole ever use drugs?

CLINT: Really?

Look, I need to know
what she was doing

and who she was doing it with.

We'll talk later,

and I'm sorry
about your friend.

I know you know
what it is, Kristen,

but she wouldn't tell me.

I know you know what it is,

so tell me, Kristen.
Look me in the eyes,

and tell me what happ--
Hey!

Back off, dude.

Seriously?

Seriously.

[ Kristen crying ]

She--She--She...
Come on.

[ crickets chirping ]

[ sighs ]

Okay, what if
it was someone she knew,

someone just messing with you?

She's in my mind.

Jake, she--
she was in Nicole's, too.

She drove Amber insane.

I can't believe
I'm saying this,

but why would she haunt you?

You didn't even know her,
Kristen.

Amber found
Morgan's profile online,

that it was still up,
and she posted on it,

said some mean shit,
and Nicole did, too,

and then I did.

And we're the only three people

that have posted on her page
since she died.

Do you know
anything else about her,

like where she lived or who
her parents were or where--

The kids who went to her
school said all kinds of shit.

I don't know
if any of it was true.

What about the teachers
at St. Francis?

I mean,
they must know something.

Look, you gotta stop thinking
about her teachers,

stop thinking about her.

You're in shock.
You need sleep,

and when you wake up--
Sho--

I can't fucking sleep, not now.

Yeah, they're for anxiety.
That's perfect.

Yeah, my Mom would notice.

Hey.

Okay, please let me help.

What, do I just take one?

Two.

We can find out more tomorrow.

[ kisses ]

Come on.

[ traffic honking ]

[ school bell rings ]

[ overlapping chatter ]

[ students laugh ]

[ telephone rings ]

[ telephone rings ]

[ door closes ]

[ clock ticking ]

[ shirt rips ]

What the hell?

[ wind blowing ]

Wish I hadn't been such a dick
to the Goth kids.

[ door creaking ]

[ clock ticking ]

[ door creaking ]

Someone there?

Hello?

[ panting ]

[ voices whispering ]

[ flashlight crackling ]

Fuck.

[ laughter ]

[ girl crying ]

[ liquid oozing ]

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

She won't let me stop!

[ screams ]

[ panting ]

[ siren passing ]

She came to me for therapy,
back when I was in residency.

I've seen a lot
of anxious, depressed kids.

I never met anyone like her.

She...

just knew things
about everyone she met.

She never realized
how much it scared other people.

I had an idea of how

she could control
her interactions with others.

I, uh--

I encouraged her to go online.

First, it was wonderful.

She was
making connections and...

growing up to be
the most beautiful girl.

That's when she met a boy...

or at least
someone claiming to be.

They never met in real life.

He told her
he had a crush on her,

wanted her
to send him a picture.

You can guess what kind.

She just wanted to have
someone in her life so badly.

And this boy, whoever it was,

he was the one that leaked it
to the rest of the school.

The things they said
to her after that, I--

In person, it was bad,

but online...

just too much.

I can still hear her screaming.

[ wailing ]

[ sobbing ]

[ sobbing fades ]

So what--what happened?

I mean, how did she--

Her grandmother
lost faith in us...

said we didn't understand.

She took Morgan away.

Three weeks later,
Morgan was dead.

Okay, uh,
well, her grandmother, then,

I mean, who is she?

She was some kind
of fortuneteller.

Where did she take Morgan?

Said they were gonna find
someplace safe

for people like them.

People like them?

That's all I know.

Ah, I'm so glad you're here.

Look, I--I don't know
what to do.

Okay, he--he's--
I'm just happy you're safe.

We'll figure this out,
I promise,

but right now,
we really have to hurry.

What are you talking about?

Come on.

Oh, man. Fuck.

He's not answering.

What do we do, text him?

Yeah, just--
just fucking text him.

I want to know what he's doing.

Unlock the goddamn door!

All right.

Found out
something you want to know,

but first, tell me what
you've been hiding about Nicole.

Huh?

Tell him.

Amber and Nicole
weren't crazy, okay?

S-Something was after them.

Something named Morgan?

How did you know that?

This was Amber's.

Okay, it says spirits

can't cross anything
made of cold iron.

That's why old cemeteries
have iron fences.

It keeps the dead inside.

Now, Amber, she used nails.

She drew shit in iron filings.

Okay, her grandmother said
she wanted to keep Morgan

somewhere safe, right?

Yeah.

Well, if she believed
in this cold-iron thing,

I know where they went.

All right,
then hit the gas, Magneto.

No. No,
someone has to stay behind

in case we don't come back.

Wow.

Fuck you guys, then.

Good luck.

[ distant siren blaring ]

[ Jake sighs ]

[ dog barking ]

"Maya."

[ bird squawks ]

[ doorbell rings ]

[ lock clicks ]

Hi.

Uh, um...

we--we'd like
a reading, please.

I'm closed.

It'll be a quick one--

Just--I have cash.

What's so important you need
a reading at 11:00 at night?

She's being haunted.

Evil spirits stay up late.

Can't be too careful.

What makes
the spirit of a person

stay in this world
after they die?

There are many reasons.

Shit.

Mrs. Rose, her...

What if the spirit
was a psychic?

When they were alive, I mean.

It's time you told me
why you're really here.

It's about your granddaughter.

What do you want with her?

It's her soul.

It's not at rest.

Mrs. Rose...

Call me Maya.

Morgan had the gift
like no one else in our family.

She felt what you felt.

She saw through your eyes.

She was too young
to understand all that.

The other children
left her alone,

but she was never lonely.

She could feel their presence.

When she got older,
she wanted to have friends.

That doctor told her
to use the computer,

said it would be
a way to reach out.

At first, it seemed good.

Then the picture.

And at the end,
she wasn't hurting just herself.

A psychiatrist
couldn't save her.

I took her back here
to try myself.

I tried everything I knew
to help her...

[ Morgan yelling ]
to get inside her mind...

and quiet her.

[ no audible dialogue ]

But I couldn't.

Then I lost her.

I told myself her pain was over,
she was free.

I don't know
what else I could have done.

Something's changed.

Morgan's not the same girl
that she was when she was alive,

and, Maya, I need
to find out what happened.

And how we can make her stop.

There is one thing...

but I can't do it alone.

[ lantern clatters ]

Is this a sÃ©ance?

Kristen will enter a trance.

Morgan has chosen you.

She has entered your mind,

and now you will enter hers.

[ ringing echoes ]

Give me your hands.

Close your eyes.

[ wind blowing ]

Breathe in, long and slow.

[ breathing deeply ]

Draw in the breath of life
deep within you.

Now, as you exhale,

let it leave you
like it left her.

Release your own spirit
from your body...

and draw hers in.

[ screams ]

It's all right.
It's all right.

It's all right.

Just keep going.

Just keep breathing.

Close your eyes.

You're doing fine.

That's good.

With each breath,

you are letting go
of the living world.

Now...

feel the eye within your mind

opening to her sight.

[ wind blowing ]

[ camera clicks ]

[ ringtones chiming ]

[ laughing ]

You disgusting freak.
You bitch!

Kill yourself, Morgan.
Nobody fucking likes you.

You're a disgusting whore.
[ yelling, jeering ]

[ crying ]

[ voices murmuring ]

You're fucking disgusting.

Look at yourself.

You should
fucking die, Morgan.

Just die.

You should fucking
kill yourself, Morgan.

You're so fucking disgusting.

[ no audible dialogue ]

[ yell ]

[ grunts ]

Are you okay?

What happened?
what did you see?

All that hatred
got inside of her.

It was like a disease.

She couldn't tell the difference

between the voices that
were in her head and her own.

They told her
she was a monster, and--

and that's exactly
what she became.

Well, how do we stop it?

MAYA: It's too late.

There's nothing
we can do for her.

What, for her?

What about us?
She's gonna kill us!

Whoa, what are you
talking about, "us"?

You--Wait.
You didn't even know her.

No.

No, you couldn't have.

My God.

It was you!

You--You told me that she
went after anyone who posted.

I thought it was a psychopath
just out for revenge.

I went on,
and I told him to go to hell.

I was just trying
to draw him out.

I gave you the pills
and made you go to sleep,

and I went, and I got this,
and I waited.

What the--

But it wasn't a psycho.

It was her.

You...

you have to stop her!

Even if I could,

I'd rather die.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
She's never gonna forgive us.

[ wail echoes ]
She's coming.

I can hear her.
She's coming for me!

Jake.

Oh, fu--You have to help us.

[ screams ]

[ objects clatter ]

Jake!

[ footsteps thumping ]

Jake?

[ panting ]

Jake?

[ sobs ]

[ iron objects clinking ]

[ whoosh ]
[ gasps ]

[ wind blowing ]

Jake?

Jake, where are you?

Jake, please say something.

[ running footsteps ]

[ voices whispering ]

[ laughter ]

Fucking whore!
Fucking kill yourself.

[ screams ]
Fucking kill yourself!

You fucking bitch!
Nobody fucking likes you!

Slut!

[ screams ]

[ sobbing ]

[ screams ]

[ panting ]

[ door creaks ]

Jake?

God, are you in here?

Come on.

Oh, my God. Jake. Thank God.

We have to get out of here.

I knew this would happen.

What are you talking about?

I knew.

Jake, no.

No, no, no, okay?

You don't have to do anything.
Just put the gun down.

No, Jake, stop. Stop.

Stop. You were just a kid.

You didn't know
what you were doing.

She's right behind you.

No, Jake!
[ gunshot ]

[ body falls ]

[ crying ]

[ oozing ]

Come up now.

It's all right.

No.

I would never wish this
upon you or him.

This vengeful spirit
is not my granddaughter.

This is not what she would want.

I don't know
if I can free you from her,

but I want to try.

It'll be painful,

but in the end,
you won't see her anymore.

What about Morgan?

What's gonna happen to her?

If you don't shut her out,
she will destroy you.

I can't just leave her.

I need to help her.

I have come this far.

I need to help her.

Please.

She's upstairs.

[ stairs creaking ]

[ screams ] Help me!

[ sobs ]

[ screaming ]

[ panting ]

Go away. No!

[ panting ] Go away.

[ screams ]

No.

[ panting ]

No. [ panting ] Go away.

[ panting stops ]

It's okay, it's almost over.

[ laughs ]

Morgan.

I'm here.

[ screams ]

[ birds chirping ]

Honey, can I get you anything?

Will you at least talk to me?

We never should have left her.

[ sighs ]

There was--There was no way
we could have known.

She was our girl, Michael.

[ sobs ]

Our little baby girl.

I know. Come here.

[ thump ]

[ gasping ] No.

I don't...

Morgan.

Morgan, shh.

It's okay.

Morgan, it's okay. Shh.

They're not real.
They're not real.

They're not real.
They're not real. I am.

Morgan, shh. It's okay.
I'm not going anywhere.

I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.

You see?

You see?

They're not gonna hurt you.

They're gone, okay?
They're gone.

Shh, it's okay.

I'm not going anywhere.

They won't come back.

They won't come back,
won't come back.

I'll stay with you until
they never come back, okay?

I'm here. I'll stay.

[ crackling ]

Shh, it's okay.

I'm not going anywhere.
