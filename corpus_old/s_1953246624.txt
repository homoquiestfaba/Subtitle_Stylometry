I'm off men,

Right now...
in my life.

Are you completely
in the closet?

I'm 100% straight.

You sold the house?

I need the money.

Re-shoots.

Get in the car,
you're going to destiny's.

You look like
you need a good shag.

Married.

You're free to have

An affair.

What does the web site say?

First rule
in the "wife of" handbook

Check your jealousy
at the door.

Someone must
have stolen my journal

And is selling off
little tidbits.

He's figured out that
it's the hollywood ex-wife.

He pretty well
described you to a tee.

I'm the hollywood ex-wife.

When people find out,
they are going to be pissed.

I just want to apologize

To liz's mom

And eve's mom

And my mom.

I'm so sorry to everyone.

It was all my fault.

I was the one
who brought my stupid journal

To that stupid party and
left my stupid birken bag

Lying where anyone could
rifle through it.

I'm so sorry
for what happened.

What was that?

Where is everyone?

I poisoned the well,

Pooped where i eat

And every other metaphor
that means

The people i see
every day hate my guts.

I'm a pariah

And i don't know what
to do.

And i'm not sure i ever will.

It's been said that hollywood
is just high school with money.

And that kind of nails it.

Popularity
is still the highest calling

To which one can aspire.

But now the popular kids
are the ones

That have three picture deals
instead of football trophies.

And the geeks are the ones
with the movie that tanked

At the box office
over the weekend.

Oh!

Useless!

But one thing
is exactly like high school.

Nobody likes a tattle-tale.

Excuse me.

Oh!

I overheard you confessing
last night

To liz in the bathroom.

Even my husband didn't know

That i had put stella
and stanley's ashes

In my breasts.

I am so sorry.

Is it so crazy
to love your dogs?

No.

To mourn them
when they die?

No.

To want to keep them as close
to your heart

As you possibly can

Forever and ever?

Uh...

Is that so crazy, molly?

Uh...

Have you ever lost a pet?

Well,
obviously not.

You broke the confidentiality
code of starting gate.

There's no confidenti--

It's implied.

Now i've convened
with all the committee heads

And we have voted you out.

Stripped
of all committee membership

Of the starter gate parent
association.

But i'm the head
of two committees:

Snow day and car pool.

No longer!

Carrie bergen is now
in charge of snow day

And leana unger
is the new car pool head.

Your vest.

Finally a makeup so smart

It knows your perfect shade.

Smart shade makeup from almay.

Breakthrough shade
sensing technology

Starts out white
and adjusts to right.

Matching your skin tone.

And try new
smart shade concealer...

From almay.

Mankind can wait.

This superhero is building his
own capital one credit card.

I want airline miles,

A low interest rate,

And a heroic picture
of my family.

Surprise!

Mmmm... guacamole.

Personalize your card
at capital one card lab.

Choose your rewards,
interest rate,

Even upload your own image
at capitalone.com.

Honey?

What's in your wallet?

Rton's
"more where that came from"

I wanna be your satisfaction

Be your number one

And just when you think
i can't love you any better

Well, i have just begun

'cause there's more
where that came from

There's more where
that came from

Get more for less.

It's target.

Hey.

What's with
the pouty face?

Are you upset or are you
going for a look?

I don't know what
to do with my face.

Okay, being despised
is a new experience.

Were you at the meeting?

Yeah, let me
tell you something...

There are some bitter hoes
in the p.t.a.

You're not even allowed

To show up for snow day.

The whole thing
was my idea.

There's never been fake snow
at starting gate.

I'll take pictures
for you and then meanwhile,

You have some fences
to mend.

You know
how sorry i am.

Aww...
not me, ma.

We're fine.

Thank you.

What kind of cupcake basket
says, "sorry i told the world

"you do threesomes
with fat people"?

One with a prius
in it.

Hey!

How bout one
with a teddy bear?

Look everyone
knows dizzy land works

Out of that coffee bean
in west hollywood.

Let's all go kick the crap
out of him.

Tomorrow, 3:30 on,
i'm good.

I'll bring the crowbar.

Why make
a big, ugly scene

When you can fix it
with cupcakes?

Oh, oh.

How's the crush going?

Oh boring!

Do we really have
to hear more

About rodney's
impossible dream?

You guys ever hear
of the dl?

The dalai lama.

The daily lantern?

The dreaded leopard.

This isn't a game show.

It stands
for the down low.

It's a thing
with some black guys.

They consider themselves
straight,

But they have sex
with men.

Sounds gay to me.

No.

Oh, yeah.

Shut up!

You're right,
it's not that interesting.

I'm late for work,
talk fast.

Rodney, when?
how?

Who started it?

Why would he think he
was straight?

You cannot breathe a word
about this.

Oh, of course not.
no.

Look who
i'm confiding in.

Me and my mates were

Always into a bit
of skullduggery.

Nothing serious.

A bit of thievery
now and again.

Mum...

Mum used to box me ears

With a hug and a wink,
if you know what i mean.

But uh...

When dad came home
from the r.a.f.

Well, all bets
were off then.

He needed somewhere
to put all his anger and rage.

And i guess i was
the logical choice.

It's okay.

I weren't much good
for my old man...

But i was good for that.

Oh, please.

You're kidding, right?

You're not really trying
to get away with this.

That whole speech was
from his movie,

The laddy
from nottingham.

Excellent!

You're wasting
our time, david.

Joan, please escort mr. shay
back to his room.

I knew it;
you're a fan.

I am a fan.

Julie, this is
so sudden.

With peter o'toole,
he played your dad

Unless you were too drunk
to notice.

Oh.

Mm-hmm.

It's...

You, kenny.

Where's jayden's room?

Right
over there.

Oh.

This is lovely.

Is jayden going to sleep
in a box?

Relax, she's not here
'til friday.

Just make sure

That mr. octopus is
on the bed when she comes,

Okay?

Mm-mmm.

You know where he is,
right?

Pretty sure it's not
in storage.

It's not an "it",
it's a "he"!

Oh, for god's sake,
kenny.

This is a tough transition
for her.

What are you going
to do

If you can't find
mr. octopus by friday?

We'll bring daddy teddy
from your house.

No, daddy teddy
can't leave my house!

Why not?
is he agoraphobic?

What are you
getting so crazy about?

I need to know
that when jaden comes here

That you are going
to put our daughter first.

You get distracted,
kenny, by shiny objects.

But mostly by yourself.

Molly, come on.

Have i ever
let you down?

Find...

The friggin'...

Octopus.

Hey, i can say that it's
from both of us, right?

Oh!
trying to hide, molly?

I'd like to hide too,
since you told everyone

I was a chubby-chaser!

But you've made
that impossible.

Well, maybe
if you didn't scream.

Did you get my cupcakes?

What kind of a low-life
exposes

Her so-called friends

For her own
self-aggrandizement?!

Hi, honey!

How was school?

Look, i understand
that you're upset.

I'm going to go home,
i'll call you,

And we'll discuss it.

What kind of a degenerate

Are you?!

Can we stay calm?

You've got a lot of nerve

Showing up here!

I'll talk
to you later.

Why was
that lady shouting?

It was just
a misunderstanding, honey.

It's okay.

But she was so mad
at us.

She wasn't mad at you.

She was mad at me.

But mommy's going
to fix it.

Hello.

Are you all right?

I've been better.

I'm going to shut down
that web site.

When i'm finished
with dizzy land,

He's not going
to know what hit him.

How late is he
at that coffee bean?

I've just got
to figure out

What i'm going to do
with jayden.

Go home,
be with your kid.

Give you a chance
to calm down.

Tomorrow morning we'll go
when the girls are at school.

Right after drop-off.

First thing.

Okay.

Thank you.

Again.

Damn.

Where'd it go?

You're using a knife?

I'll see to it
that you're not splitting

Any more pills at destiny's.

Ouch.

Pill cutter.

Gloves.

Joan, are you ready

For this?

David shay says
you are vital to his recovery

Because
of your refreshing honesty.

I want you to focus all
of your attention on him.

We'll divvy
up your other clients.

No way,
i'm very attached to, um,

What's-his-name
and the other one.

Can i persuade you
to work through the weekend?

Will you give gary

All the menial mindless tasks

For the next two weeks?

Done.

Hey, if anyone should
be doing menial mindless work

It's you.

Why?

Because you are...

Menial and mindless!

Okay.

So you'll do it?

I'll think about it.
think yes.

I'll uh--
i'll owe you one.

Wow.

You're absolutely sure these
are ashlee simpson's

Blood results?

What kind of low-life

Exposes innocent people

For their own
self-aggrandizement?

Pace yourself.

Molly kagan!

The hollywood ex-wife
in the flesh.

I'm dying.

Those things i wrote
were private.

Oh, honey, there is
no private anymore.

Haven't you noticed?

You listen to me.

Listen to me!

I am going to get
an injunction

Against you.

And then i'm going
to bring

Down the wrath
of god on you.

I love it!

The hollywood ex-wife
threatens me

With "the wrath of god".

It writes itself.

Don't type that.
why are you typing that?

"with me right now
is none other than the ex-- "

Stop that...
stop that!

Molly, molly, moll--

Give it to me,
give it--

Ah!

Oh no!

Oh no.

Good golly,
miss molly.

D"mzm?o?mzm?ozmzm?ozm?o?ozmzmzm?o?ozm?ozm?o?ozm?ozmzmz

Morning kids!

Oh! pancakes.

I knew you'd be happy.

Bisquick shake 'n pour.

Just add water,
shake, and pour.

Bisquick shake 'n pour.

Shake, pour, make.

Making your home look like
a picture in a magazine...

With walmart's
prices on the new

Better homes and
gardens collection,

You can do anything.

See the entire line of

Better homes and gardens
furnishings,

Only at walmart.

Save money.
live better.

Walmart.

Something soft and smooth.

Or something natural
for a healthy look.

Chapstick.

Because healthy lips
should never go naked.

I went to calcutta
for three months,

Came back with malaria.

My wife never
gave me a straw.

She also never
gave you malaria.

I see.

Straw of guilt.

Keep your head
still.

Okay, i want to ask you
some questions.

Yes, i noticed you at school

Before you came
to writing class.

No, that's not what i--

Really?

I want to make sure
that your cognitive ability

Is okay.

Shoot.

Who was
our first president?

George washington.

What's the capital
of france?

"f".

Who's the secretary
of the interior?

Um...

I think you
have a concussion.

Are my pupils dilated?

Let's see.
you're fine.

Um...

Just make sure you
put the ice on there

For another 20 minutes.

Ow.

Not bad for a guy
with a pulled groin muscle.

Don't be telling anyone
where that happened.

Don't need that
on the internet,

"devon marsh sidelined by his

Hot, sexy wife".

"...who cannot
get enough".

What's that smell?

That's j-lo.

I don't know j-lo.

The perfume, devon.
who you been kissing?

You must wear j-lo.

Don't start with me,
baby.

I might've got
some samples.

I gotta go.

I bet you debbie
from dodgertown

Got some samples too!

Bye.

You're
the featured video.

I love the title,
"mohammad moll-ee".

That's your teacher?

I want to go
to school.

I really hate today.

I hate that i can't turn
on an electrical device

Without seeing myself
doing something stupid.

I hate that-that-

Liz has to pick up jayden,

Because my daughter doesn't want
to be seen with me.

And i don't think tomorrow's
going to be much better, either.

I've got an idea.

Come to destiny's
with me on the weekend.

Anthea owes me,
they've got a spare room,

No cell phone,
no tv, no internet...

No clogged toilet.

I don't have a clogged
toil-- oh.

No, i'm not running away.

Although now i kind
of want to.

Staying put,
i can handle this.

And since when
do you work weekends?

Oh.
doesn't pappy mind?

The only thing pappy minds
is the thought

Of having sex with me.

What do you mean?

He's given me up
for lent...

Or forever--
whichever lasts longer.

Can he not,
you know...

Stand me?

Oh no, no, no.

No, it's not physical.

He'd just rather
watch charlie rose

Than sleep with me.

Which may have been going
on for years.

But i was too drunk
to notice.

Well, and--
so that's that?

No more sex?

No, no, no,
this is the best part,

He said
i can have an affair

As long as i don't
fall in love.

Good deal, right?

It's cruel.

No, it's brilliant.

He's thought long and hard
about this,

How to keep me
without having me.

If i were you,

I would have sex
with the first thing

That walked
through that door.

Oh...

What about
the second thing?

Oh...

Maybe i should've
left buster in the car.

The kids are out back.

Thanks for
picking her up.

Come on in,
you know everybody.

Is this
your clubhouse?

Is there
a secret handshake?

Yeah.
and no boys allowed.

Good.

Devon has been acting
a little crazy

Ever since he's been
on the dl.

Devon is
on the dl?

Yeah.

He's got a strained groin.

It happens.

That's
what i tell him,

Just give it a rest,
baby.

But he just--
he wants

To get
out there every night.

And you're-
you're okay with this?

Every player spends time
on the disabled list.

Disabled list?

Yeah, it's where they
put the injured ball players.

What did you think
being on the dl...?

Oh, oh!

You guys really don't know
anything about baseball.

Oh, your flowers
have just closed up.

Kenny's here.

I wish it wasn't
kenny's weekend.

Jayden!

Get your stuff together.

Daddy's here!

You want
to see something?

I'm going to bring
down the wrath of god on you!

Oh.

Wait one second, this is
my favorite bit right here.

Oh bang, that hurt.

You know you're all
over the web, right?

Whoa, whoa,
what's that?

Ah.

Mr. caterpillar.

But mr. octopus is
at your apartment, right?

Mr. caterpillar is better
than mr. octopus,

More legs.

Jayden will be fine
with it.

Did you
set up her room?

Yes, molly.

Does it have a bed
in it?

Oh...

I knew i forgot something.

I'm kidding.

Oh, do you think
this is funny?

It happens
to be very important

That jayden feel good
about your apartment.

That she feels safe.

And at home,
just like she does--

Bitch!

You're worried
about jayden at my house?

At least we don't have
drive-by cupcakings.

Oh don't try and
turn this around on me.

Why are you yelling?

Um...

Sometimes your father's tone
sounds like yelling, honey.

It'syourtone.

Um...

We were just uh...

Um, we were just talking
about mr. octopus.

Which daddy can't find
right now,

Because of the move.

So if you think that you're not
going to be able to sleep

At daddy's new house
without him,

It's-- it's totally fine.

We understand.

You're not fun anymore.

I want to go to daddy's.

Okay, okay.

Hop in.

Seatbelt.

We'll see you
sunday night.

Molly kagan,

Mother of the year.

The offer's
still open.

Take me to rehab.

So i got a pain reliever
for my sore shoulder.

For band practice...

Need another one
for headaches.

Different pains,
different pain relievers.

But now advil is my every pain reliever.

Works wherever i hurt.

I'm all advil.

The new coffee-mate
world cafe collection.

Italian sweet creme,

Tiramisu,

Hazelnut biscotti.

Three delicious flavors

That'll make any moment
magnifico,so stir it up

With new flavors from coffee's
perfect mate.

In malibu there are more homes
for rehab

Than there are hotel rooms.

And they have better food,

Incredible views

And spa treatments
to die for.

Just don't expect too much
from the mini bar.

Maybe you and pappy

Should go to counseling.

Why?

So i can hear more
about his feelings?

I'm sick
of his feelings.

Don't do anything
you'll regret.

Just something
he'll regret.

Well take a look around.

I've got to go
and search david shay's room

I haven't found
any contraband yet,

But um, he's got
the best damn dark chocolate.

You got a light?

Oh... no, sorry.

I don't smoke.

So uh, it can't
be coke or diet pills.

You don't look puffy enough
for an alchy.

I'm guessing

Valium?
painkillers?

No, i don't really have
that kind of problem.

That's not going to go down well
at the meetings.

No, really.

I'm just here avoiding
my life.

Valium's a lot cheaper.

I'll rember that
for next time.

This is the one place
you can't smoke.

Which i suppose
explains the smoking.

Oh wow.

I've always wanted
to do that

Ever since
i saw grease two.

Yeah, that's almost
worth smoking for.

Hello, julie!

Woo!

Come have a splash.

Sorry, have to change the
batteries on your toothbrush.

What does it take?

Double as?

You're too clever
by half, julie.

Whoo!

Yee-haw.

It's the last time.
i mean it.

Come on, jayden.

I wanna talk to you
about a little something

I got going,
called "blood canal".

It's going
to be huge.

I hear
it's unreleaseable.

No, it uh--

We're reshooting
a few key scenes,

We're adding
an evil american president

For foreign.
oh, great.

But those-those scenes could use
the zach mcneill touch,

If you know
what i mean, huh?

Well, i'm really
into my novel right now.

O- oh.

No offense, zach,
but a novel

Is pretty much a speck
on a fly

On a piece of crap
up an elephants ass.

None taken.

Daddy, daddy.

That boy called me pig ears.

And he told me i grew up
on a farm.

Well you tell him,

That he's
a hyundai-driving loser,

Who's going to end
up sweltering

In some hell-hole in the valley,
north of ventura.

North of...?

Ah, just tell him
to go blow it out of his butt.

I can do that.

Good girl.

I'm such a better father
since the divorce.

The only five-star chef
who can cook without booze.

I need you out
of the pool.

God, i hate that man.

Can i come back next
visitor's day?

I'm not going
to be here.

I'm not a real addict,
remember?

You've sworn off men,
and yet your fingers

Are just tingling
to call up zach

And see how his head is,
placing you smack dab

Into the danger zone
of broken resolve.

Am i wrong?

I think she needs
at least another week here.

I think the best thing
for my resolve

Is watching my friends'
screwed up sex lives.

I'm not screwed up
about sex; felix is.

You're screwing someone
who's screwed up about sex,

Which makes it screwed up
once removed.

And i'm going
to screw somebody

Because pappy's screwed
up about sex.

Which makes it screwed up
once removed

From the husband's side.
ha!

Out!

It is so dreary.

Why can't we just have therapy
in the pool?

It's equine therapy.

Just get out.

Give me a laugh
and i'll think about it.

At least the horse's
won't bore you

With stories of how they woke up
in their own vomit.

Excellent.

Head to your room to change,
and i'm right behind you.

17 days
and counting,

Then he'll be gone,

Gone from my life
forever.

Never to be thought of
again,

Until i read about how
he's offended another minority.

Never to hear
his odious accent

Or see him splashing
away in the pool.

He's perfect.

He's mentally repellant
yet physically attractive.

He'll shag anything.

I certainly fall
withinthatrange.

And when
it's over he'll go out,

Take up drinking again
and he won't rember a thing.

God, i hope i didn't wear
my granny pants.

Wait, joan.

No, i know what you're
going to say,

He's a disgusting homophobe

And i should have nothing
to do with him.

But that's exactly why
he's perfect.

I've got
to stop this.

It's her choice.

It's a lousy one.

Oh, what a relief.

I lost him.

Well you're a woman
on a mission.

Unfortunately,
it's a misguided one--

Like vietnam misguided.

I'm calling pappy's
bluff.

Is that what this
is about?

Yes.

No.

I'll do you.

I want to make mad,

Passionate, heterosexual
love on you.

But you're
as gay as a balloon.

Well i did it once
in high school,

And i don't remember
any complaints.

Now get undressed,
young lady.

Because rodney
is taking you to heaven.

All right, rodney.

If anyone can take the air out
of your balloon,

It's joan mcallister.

Should we get
a room or--

You know what straight women say
about men like you?

No.

It's such a shame.

So drop those boxers

And let's make magic.

You must really hate
david shay.

Why should he be rewarded
for being a bigot?

Rewarded,
that's sweet.

Don't worry.
you're safe.

Pappy said not to sleep
with someone

I might fall
in love with.

And i'm crossing david shay
off the list.

Okay, if-- you haven't
changed my mind.

All right,
you know what?

Just forget it really--
just--

So i guess we're
on the same schedule

With our kids.

It's usually not my weekend
with skylar,

But the ex wanted
to go to cabo

With her
new boyfriend jeff.

Ah.

Boyfriends really screw up
the schedule, you know?

Yeah.

You could bang out these pages
at starbucks--

Not doing it.

It's a bitch
when the wife dates,

Isn't it?

Molly date much?

Uh, there was
this homeless guy once.

You sure--
yeah--

Homeless guy?

Blow it out of your butt.

And don't come around
anymore.

Everyone hates you.

That's my girl.

I've never seen any kid take
on donny spielberg before.

Donny who?

Spielberg's nephew.

No, no, no, no, no.

Jayden, out, out, out.

Why?
uh, be--

Do you know who
that was?

Come on,
out, out, out.

You're lying.
it's okay, we'll be back.

All right.

I want
to ride the horse.

I guess he didn't read
the brochure.

Equine therapy isn't
about riding;

It's about communicating
with your horse.

It's some nonsense
about basic equestrian

Ground skills,
whatever those are.

Bringing to light patterns
in our lives,

Whatever those are.

And then all sorts
of deep,

Meaningful things
will happen.

Whatever they are.

What a crock of crap.

Well said.

Wow, you're pretty good
at that stuff.

Did you grow up
around horses?

Oh, i'm-- i'm sorry,
i didn't mean--

You want to try it?

Me?
oh, no, no.

I'm just
an observer.

Chicken.

She is really
shut down.

Why don't you try
lifting his hoof.

Yes, honey,
give it a try.

Yeah, don't you want
your patterns revealed?

Okay.

Okay.

Clear your mind
and lift it up.

It's not moving.
i wonder what that means.

Okay.
come on.

Okay, lift your paw
for ma.

It's a hoof.

Oh, right.
hoof.

I'm more of a dog person.

I don't have much experience
with, um, horses.

That's okay.
it's not about the horse.

Okay, obviously the horse
is tired.

He's been
lifting his leg all day.

Is it the horse
or is it your life?

I'm pretty sure
it's the horse.

The horse isn't stopping you
from anything.

You're stopping you.

Think about it.

Think about it.

Hate you.

Hate you too.

Okay, we can do this.

Okay.

Okay, baby.

Kids are resilient.

Divorce builds
character.

I never
really apologized.

Cupcakes make
everything better.

I put some
in my boobs.

I'd like
to screw all night

And then vacuum.

I am so
getting you fired.

Your worst symptoms...

Sinus pressure,

Nasal congestion and pain.

You can suffer
through them...

Or you can power
through them.

With advil cold & sinus.

It combines
2 super powers--

The power of advil...

Plus a strong decongestant...

In a power through formula...

You can get
at the pharmacy counter.

So don't suffer through
your sinus symptoms...

Power through them.

With advil cold & sinus.

Ask for it

At the pharmacy counter.

There are some things
money can't buy.

For everything else there's
credit or debit mastercard.

Fan of the game, wherever
there's a game.

If i can give birth
without an epidural,

I can get
that friggin' hoof up.

Hi.

Hey, there.
it's me again.

Hey, look,
i know--

I know that we had
some issues before.

Muchacha.

Oh, muchacho...
sorry.

How about--

How about you lift
that leg for me now?

Huh?

Almighty.

Uh, pinch his tendon.

The leg will come
right up.

Do you have horses
at home?

Which home?

Mom and bill's
or dad and sheila's?

Divorce is tough.

I know.

Hey...

Is this yours?

Yes.

Oh, i'm sorry.
i didn't see anything.

Good.

Is that why you came
out here?

Because of something
in the letter?

I came out here because i like
horses a lot better than people.

They don't ask irritating
questions, for one.

Okay look,

I'm really, really sorry.

I did see some
of the letter.

Why are you so upset?

About the lyrics
to "oklahoma"?

I mean it's--

It's kind
of a fun song.

Do you really want
to know?

My mom sent them
to me.

Because instead
of telling people

That i'm drying up
in some rehab,

She told everyone that i'm away
at musical theatre camp.

I have to learn the song
before i go home.

Oh, wow.

I didn't see
that coming.

So do you want
to say something now

About how she's just trying
to protect me,

Or how she
really loves me?

No.

She sounds
like an asshole.

Sometimes perspective
is the most sobering

Treatment of all.

Okay good, he's here.

You see him?

Right there.

You remember what to say?

Why do i have
to apologize, daddy?

He started it.
i know,

But sometimes daddies
make mistakes,

And this was one
of them.

Hey.

I'm sorry i told you
to blow it out of your butt.

There we go,
okay.

Everybody's happy?
everybody's friends.

All right?

No need
to ever mention it again.

Like at the family seder
or anything.

Don't worry, we don't talk
about losers at passover.

Pig ears!

You okay? yeah, thanks daddy.

Mm-hmm?

You're leaving.

But you haven't danced
with your inner child

In the serenity tent.

This place is for people
with bigger problems

Than being banned
from snow day.

So you're ready
to get back in the game.

Yeah.

I learned from my horse

That i need
to face the music.

Mm-hmm.

I also learned
from my horse

That i've
got it pretty good.

And i learned
from my horse

That i need to be
with my daughter right now.

Did you have sparky?

You know,
you did it again.

You took care of me.

Oh.

I wish i could
do something for you.

But i don't know what.

Nobody does.

There is no group
for this particular problem.

Hey.

I'm here for you.

Whatever you need.

And you do
what you need to do.

I don't even know
if i can.

What are my options?

We already know i'm not big
with the 80 and over set.

You...

Are a very
desirable woman.

Aw.

Not you, too.

Come on.

Hey,
do me a favor.

That girl desperately needs
someone to talk to.

Oh, god.

You know how i feel
about caring.

I know.

But unfortunately for you,
you're really good at it.

Joan...

Great job
covering david shay.

Okay, gary,
you've got your sarcastic voice.

Why?

He just went awol.

Someone left the barn door open
last night

And one of the horses
is gone.

Oh, i gotta deal
with this.

Who the hell
left the barn door open?

I've got to go pick up
my daughter.

At her dad's.

Don't worry,
she won't turn out like me.

You're not done yet.

Bye.

Mommy!

Hey!

Oh gosh.

How are you, honey?

Daddy found mr. octopus

And he let me watch "the
40-year-old virgin"

And he threw a spielberg
in the pool.

You threw a spielberg
in the pool?

Yeah, the kid
was mean to her.

I'm trying not to think
about it, though.

Whoa, whoa.

Uh, what're you doing?

Confusing messages.

You can lead a horse
to rehab,

But you won't
let a man drink.

Very good.
now get off...

'cause this turf's going
to ruin my heels.

Make me.

I'd rather not.

You know, the upside
of not having children

Was avoiding this kind
of a tantrum.

Oh!
oh!

You know...

I've paid extra
to have you all to myself.

You may have been
shortchanged.

I don't think so.

All right.

Here we go.

Honey,
what's up?

I don't want to go.

But you were looking
forward to it.

What if people start yelling
at you again?

We'll get through it.
we've got each other.

Jayden you have
two parents

That love you unconditionally.

And you can always come
to us no matter what

And we'll work it out.

But right now,
no running away.

We've got to face it.

You have to face it.

I didn't write a diary
with mean things in it.

Not a bad point.

You're right.

I've got to face it.

Will you help me?

The chick
with the doggy boobs--

She's got
a pretty good arm.

How's your head?

Got the whole executive
branch memorized.

Mm.

You want me to peg her?

Nope.

I'm cool.

Cover me.

Ah!
