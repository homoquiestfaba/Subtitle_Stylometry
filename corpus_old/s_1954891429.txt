"Proof of the Devil (2014)" ^ (Run time : 01:11:00)

How do I look?
Ghastly.

Are we rolling?
Yep.

Okay.
Eddie Daniels,  DIRECTOR

Eddie Daniels
DIRECTOR

3 years ago, the police of
Orleans Parish, Louisiana,

started finding bodies,
in pieces.

The work of a serial killer,
nicknamed, "The Butcher."

A long man hunt ended 
not with an axe wielding maniac,

but a 17 year old boy,
Jesse Winters.

After his capture,
Jesse was tried as an adult,

found guilty of 22 murders
and sentenced to death.

On his 18th birthday,
he was executed at the

Louisiana State Penitentiary,
by lethal injection.

The curious thing about his case,
however, was not the murders,

but rather, his legal defense.

Jesse's mother insisted,
that he was innocent.

She claimed that Jesse had
been possessed for over a year

and that varies exorcism
attempts had failed.

His final exorcism
performed by now,

excommunicated priest,
Father Robert Tomlin,

was the last time his mother
saw him before his arrest.

Now, for the first time
outside the courtroom,

we can show the tape
of Jesse's failed exorcism.

Now, the images you're
about to see, are graphic.

And we advise younger, sensitive
viewers to look away.

Case # 42 Jesse Winters
Property of Baton Rouge Police Department

You're not welcome into
the body of this child!

You're not welcome,
I cast you out!

You're hurting him!
No! It's the demon I'm hurting!

Jesse.

Oh, Christ.
There's no pulse.

Don't do this, Dr. Winters!
Leave us alone!

Stop it!
You'll put us all in danger!

Get away! We're leaving, Rob!
Don't!

Don't do this!

Jesse, stop!
Don't do this! Jesse!

Jesse, stop.
Don't hurt me.

I would never hurt you.

Jesse escaped and began
his murderous rampage.

Starting with his own father.

But this documentary
is not about Jesse,

it's about his mother, Kate.

Kate Winters claims
that she can prove

that Jesse was indeed
possessed by a demon.

How?

For the first time on camera,

Kate is going to herself,
become possess by a demon.

Will it work?

Or is she a fake?

<font color="#ff7575">THE EXORCISM TAPES</font>

Day 1

Yes, uh.
We got turned around at the exit.

We're on the way
to your house now.

Probably 5 minutes.

Okay.

We're a few minutes late
and she's already calling?

She's fucking crazy, Stu.

Nah.
She's not crazy.

When rich people are crazy,
it's called eccentric.

Her son killed 23 people.

Don't raise a child like that
unless you're fucking crazy.

Everything look good?
Yep.

Well, double check it,
because I swear, Joey,

if you bring me a bunch
of out of focus shots

you'll never touch a camera again.

Well.
She can just...

chill the fuck out,
'cause we're almost there.

Alright.
We're here.

Alright, guys.
Let's be professional.

No laughing. No joking.
No comments.

No matter what kind of
weird shit you hear, okay?

This lady is paying us a lot of money,
so let's just do our job.

Alright.

Okay.

I baptized Jesse.
I knew him his entire life.

He's just a perfectly normal kid.

And this thing at the end,
that wasn't Jesse.

So, yes,
Absolutely, he was possessed.

That's why Jesse kill people.

No, it was the demon inside him
that killed those people.

How many exorcism have you done?

Quite a few.

But I will tell you, there was something
very different about Jesse's case.

Something like I've never seen before.

This demon was stronger,

more in control.

So, this is the scene of the infamous
Jesse Winters's exorcism.

Yes.
Any regrets?

None.
I take full responsibility for everything.

The tapes. My excommunication.
Everything.

So, what went wrong?

I didn't have enough time or trust
or faith.

Jack didn't understand like Kate.

So, what do you think about
what Kate is doing here?

I think this documentary is a great thing

People need to know what happened.

No, not the documentary.

I mean, what do you think about
Kate becoming possess herself.

What?

What are you talking about?
How can she even do that?

Well.
We're going to find out.

Are you all out of your minds?

Look, even if this were possible.

you saw what that demon
did to Kate's husband.

Not to mention all the other poor souls.

This isn't a game.
Look.

You and I both know that
nothing is going to happen.

You do not even realise what
you're getting involve with,

what's at risk, son.

It's a good TV.

I can't be a part of this.

Please.
Leave my house.

One more question.
Get out!

If you're smart, you stop
this before it's too late.

I'm going to say it.

Say what?

You just got us kicked
out of a priest's house.

How's that even happened?

Priests are the most
forgiving people on Earth.

He's not a priest anymore, remember.
He was excommunicated.

Still, we'll be going
straight to hell for that.

No way.
Not on my own.

I'm bring you all with me.

Speaking of which.

I really appreciate.
I really appreciate you getting me this job.

Come on, Sty.
You don't have to thank me for that.

I know,
but I needed it.

The money, you know.

Hey. There's no one I rather
go to hell with than you guy.

Kate Winter's Home

Is this how the stars do it?
Of course.

So.
Where exactly are we?

This is Jesse's bedroom.

He was so sick,
especially at the end.

There are a lot of
bad memories in here.

I can't believe I'm in
the Butcher's bedroom.

What did you say?
The butcher.

That's what the media called him.

Don't you ever say that again.

That's my son we're talking about.
I'm sorry.

You got it?

Yeah, sure.
You're the boss.

Alright.
Follow me.

Oh, hey.
Where do you want this equipment?

Put the equipment in here.

My room is down the hall.

Ms. Winters, can I have a moment.
Sure.

Dr. Ben Hatcher
PSYCHYATRIST CENTRAL UNIVERSITY

This is Dr. Ben Hatcher

He is a psychiatrist I hired
to prove I'm not crazy.

Do you have to
film me right now?

As a matter of fact, Dr. Hatcher,
I do.

From this point forward,
everything has to be filmed.

What if I object?

Then I'll replace you.

You sought me out, Ms. Winters,
not the other way around.

Yes, I did.

But the footage comes first.

Hey, uh. Where do you
want me to put these cameras?

Hey, Joey.
Give him a hand.

Put them up where
I showed you earlier.

What's this?
Legal releases.

Sign,
and have you assistants sign as well.

Why?

So, if something goes wrong,
you don't sue the hospital.

Or Ms. Winters.

Or me.

Dr. Hatcher,
where does all this go?

Down that hallway, turn left.

Do you like the music?
Yes, it's nice.

It was Jesse's favorite.

Can you tell me
what I'm looking at here?

I'm going to use these items
to summon a demon to possess me.

You're sure this is going to work?

Absolutely

Done my research.

It's going to work.

Can you give us an idea
what to expect when you do this.

The same thing
that happened to Jesse.

I can't believe you're so calm.

I'll be terrified if I were you.

Do you have any children?
No.

Then you wouldn't know
what it's like

to have the world labeled
your only son a monster.

Did you read what they say
about me in the papers?

And then they celebrated
when they executed a child.

I thought Jesse was 18.

He was my son.

If I can prove that
a demon can possess me,

then the would will have to accept
that my Jesse was innocent.

I think we're done here.

What a creepy fucking kid.

Looks like a killer to me.

This is exciting.

Yeah.
Sure.

It's exciting.

Fucking eccentric.

Eww.
What the hell is this?

Who told you to open that?
This is a biohazard.

Do you have any idea how unsanitary
it is to keep this in the kitchen?

Never mind why you have it
in the first place.

Don't worry, it's not human.
That's not the point.

What are you doing?

I don't want to talk about it.

Dr. Hatcher.
We're ready for the interview.

Jesse had a very tragic story.

He should not have been
sentenced to death.

He had a mental illness.

You don't believe
he was possessed.

No.
I do not.

If you don't believe Kate's story,
then what are you doing here?

Ms. Winters hired me as a consultant to lend
some credibility to this undertaking of her's.

I'm going to monitor her
mental and physical health

Why?
Simply put.

It's my job to determine whether or not
Ms. Winters can be possess by a demon,

or if she is in need of actual therapy

What are the odds that
something happens to Kate?

Nothing is going to happen to her.

I suspect she's currently suffering
from a mild level chronic depression.

This is why she is using her
religious fantasy as a crutch.

It's my hope that going through this
experience we can get her pass this,

and get her off this crutch.

Tell me a little about
your qualifications, Ben.

I'm a psychiatrist and a professor in the
department of medicine at Central University.

You're also an author.

Can I get an autograph?

Done your research on me.

Yes, I have written a book.

And was it a best seller?

It did okay.
It's more of an academic textbook.

Academic? You try to disprove the
existence of God, miracle, demonic possession.

It doesn't sound academic to me.
You're over simplifying.

In my book, I wrote about several
cases studies where some supernatural behavior

was really just a
manifestation of mental illness.

So, yes.
It is an academic book.

Faith and religion are the
last lies of an insane world.

In it's quest for true understanding,

humanity has to abandon the monsters
under the bed and the angels in the sky.

What's your point?

Those are pretty strong words
especially for a former priest.

I was never ordained.

What happened?
Why did you lose your faith?

My faith isn't relevant. My scientific expertise
is the only thing that matters here.

Well, I disagree. I
think it's all relevant.

I'm here to certify Ms. Winters
is mental sound.

And that is the only thing
you and I are going to discuss.

The rest of my life
is non of your business.

I see why she wanted
you for the job.

I'm glad my resume
meets your approval.

So. Have you guys made
anything I might have seen?

'Ghost chasers ".

Is that on TV?
Used to be.

Well, that's too bad.

Yeah. Producers were
a bunch of amateurs.

It's so good,
it could put insomniacs to sleep.

Oh. I guarantee this
project will be memorable.

It already is.
Enjoy the food.

If there is anything else you need,
just let me know.

Ms. Winters, aren't you
going to eat anything?

Oh, no. I can't eat anything
before the ceremony tonight.

You want to do that tonight?
Well, at 3 AM.

I have to get a blood sample.
I need a baseline psychiatric profile.

So, let's get it.

Okay.

I got it.
You just finish your dinner.

You know, Sarah.
You have a nice face, for a camera.

Thank you.
Any interest in acting?

No.

Alright, Kate.

I'm going to ask you a series
of questions

to measure a baseline brain functions
and cognitive awareness.

Okay.

Can you tell me what
you're drawing right now?

Symbols that will allow me
to summon a demon.

What is your full name?
Catherine Elizabeth Winters.

And where are you right now?
In my house, my bedroom.

What is your earliest memory?

When I was 6, my father
took me to a Dodgers  game.

You don't remember
anything before that?

Not off the top of my head.

Alright, Kate.

As far as I can tell
you are mentally healthy.

Great. Let's get started with the ceremony.
Okay, let's clear the room.

No, you all must participate.

Whoa, uh uh.
I did not sign up for this.

You participate or you get out
of my house right now.

You must all put your hands
on the altar.  Including you.

Dark Lord.

You humble servant,
Kate Winters

awaits you.

Dark Lord.
Judge me worthy.

Judge my worth,
and convey to him, The Morning Star.

He who binds the light.

Dark Lord, judge me worthy.
I offer my soul to you.

This is my offering, my body.
My body is yours.

I am yours.

Jimmy, listen.
I got some great footage, man.

 It's amazing.

She did the ceremony and she...

she painted the walls with blood
and stabbed some animal heart.

It's crazy.
This is some good stuff.

I even ripped a few pages
from her creepy ass book.

I was planning on faxing them to you.
So, let's talk numbers.

No, that's a fucking price
for a Youtube video.

This is real, man.
This is like an exclusive.

Come on, man. How am I
suppose to pay these guys?

No.
If you don't pay me,

how in hell am I
suppose to pay them?

No, I know but...
Hello?

Hello?
Jimmy!

Shit!

Hey.
Can I get you to come inside?

Is there any alcohol in here?
No.

Give me the keys. I'm going
to get something to drink.

Why?
So you can wreck my car again?

Jesus Christ, man. What the
hell have you got me into?

Stu, I got you a job thatâ€™s
going to solve all your problems.

I showered twice
and I still feel gross.

Yeah, and never tell me about it.

Do you want to get out of here?
I was going to get a drink, maybe.

I don't know.
You guys going out?

No, I'm going to bed.

Yeah, I probably should to.
I got an early morning.

You are a fucking cock block,
you know that?

Good night, Stu.

Day 2
Dec 12th 2010

How was your night?

Not good.
It was unfortunately quiet.

What did you expect to happen?

I expected this morning that
you should be talking to a demon.

Why is it so important you become possess?
I don't know what I could have done wrong!

I did everything I was suppose to.

Isn't it more likely that
Jesse was in fact mentally ill,

and that there was no demon.

No. I have to figure this out.
I must have missed something.

Okay. Why don't you tell me about...
We'll do this later.

Kate.
Just one more minute, please.

So,  Dr. Hatcher.
How was your night?

So. How did you guys
sleep last night?

Like shit.
I have fucking nightmare after nightmare.

Yeah.
That stuff really got to me.

My grandma once told me a story about
somebody who did something like this.

Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

In her hometown in North Carolina.
Apparently she was some kind of witch.

People she didn't like,
she just killed them, from a distance.

With her mind, huh?
That's the the dumbest shit I ever heard.

My grandma never lied.
It's true.

She put a curse on them and then
they would die the next day.

Sounds like a small-town tall tale.
Yeah. Maybe.

Ha, ha.
It's funny.

Stu, are you okay?

Stu!

I think he's choking.
Stu!

Are you alright?

Not funny.

I was waiting for you to
give me mouth-to-mouth.

Next time, I hope you really choke.

Oh, come on.
It was just a joke.

What?
Where are you going?

Unlike you guys,
I have work to do.

That was funny, right?
You're a real dumb ass, Stu.

Come on.

Oh, Jesse.

I failed.
Why?

What's going on?
She's just working thought something.

You're not going to stop her?
No, she need to work through it.
(Why? What else do I need to do!)

Jesse.

Can you help me.
I have to do this.

Ha ha ha!

What am I missing, Jesse?
What am I doing wrong?

I have performed the ceremony.

I said the god damn words!

Kate, what are you doing?

I don't know what I am doing wrong?
What am I missing?

I wouldn't know.

That's it.
What's it?

He was sick.

Kate, are you okay?
I am now.

I just had to get that
out of my system.

Thank you.

Is the door locked?
Yes.

Ben can't know about this, okay?

If he knows I'm doing this to myself,
he would call me insane.

And probably try
to have me committed.

Don't even worry about it.

I'm weakening my body
so that it will speed up the process.

And then the damn thing
can take me.

I want to ask you what happened
in Jesse's room this morning?

I was just looking
for answers.

I'm a little concern about you.

I'm not confident we
should continue this.

Do you think I'm crazy?
I don't like using that word.

And what word would you use?

Insane?

Mental ill? Deranged?
Depressed? Confused?

Do you feel any of those
words describe you?

You remind me of my
poor dead husband.

God bless his soul.

You know, Jack was a doctor too.
He was brilliant.

You don't mention of him often.
No, and I'm not going to.

I don't need you to tell me I have
unresolved issues with my dead husband.

Kate.

I lost somebody once.

She was, very close to me.

It was hard.

I felt a lot of anger.

Who was it?
My sister.

I remember Jesse
when they killed him.

The look in his eye.

When his veins
filled with potassium chloride.

You know in the weeks
before he was executed,

the demon wasn't in there anymore.

And he didn't remember
what he had done.

And he didn't know why
he was being executed.

That's my memory of Jesse.

But you have to grief,
and move on.

God, why?
Why are you stop this?

Why?
I did everything I was suppose to!

Please! Please!
Just let the damn thing have me!

What happened?
I don't know. The door just flew open.

It must have just
been the wind.

How the hell did
this blow over here?

Is that how this is?

Check the weather.

I think there might be a big storm
blowing through today.

It happened.

Just clean this up.

 So. Is this the weirdest thing
you've ever seen?

Huh.
Hardly.

I once monitored a homicidal sleepwalker.
That shit was terrible.

Yeah. We were once on a shoot where
this guy claimed he could hear ghosts

and they told him all
sorts of scary things.

I don't believe in ghosts.

Come on, Stu.
That guy was a pathological liar.

Okay. Well. Maybe that one was a hoax,
but we have seen unexplainable things.

We are witnessing one right now.

Come on. All I'm saying is that,
I had a few ghostly encounters.

Well, Stu.
I work in reality, not reality TV and...

Since working for Dr. Hatcher,
I find more often than not,

people claiming to see ghosts
have Avery real problem.

Honestly, you show a lot of the same similarities
to a few very unfortunate patients I have treated.

You might want to consider
a therapy after this study is done.

I did... No, I don't think...
No, I...

Relax.
I'm just messing with you.

Not going to happen.

It's going to happen.
I'm wearing her down.

Father Tomlin?

I'm Dr. Ben Hatcher.
Thanks for seeing me.

Absolutely.

Now, I don't meant to be rude.

But I'm not sure that it's a good idea
for you to see Kate right now.

I know what Kate is trying to do.
I just can't ignore it.

Everyone has their own processes,
when it comes to grieving

<i>I'm not talking about this documentary.</i>

I'm talking about Kate's soul,
about her trying to become possess.

I understand your believes, Father.

But at this point of her therapy,

this is exactly what she needs
to be separated from.

Yes. But, you don't understand.
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

Kate.
What is he doing here?

You know, you need to leave
or you will ruin everything!

Kate. I came here to stop you
from doing this.

Why would you stop me?

Don't you understand
this is all we have left?

This is the only way that
the church will accept you back.

I don't care about that anymore, Kate.

Don't you realize
what you're risking?

You know what?
It doesn't matter.

Because it's done.
The ceremony is done.

This won't bring Jesse back.

There's nothing you can do.
You're wrong.

Because if I succeed, then the world
will have to  believe me.

The world doesn't care.

Get out!
Hey.

Get out!
Hey.

You get the fuck out of my house!

You all are in so much danger
and you don't realize it.

When you come to me for help,
pray it won't be too late.

Get out!

Just leave her alone.

She needs to be alone right now.

Get the damn thing
out of my face.

This could get out of hand quickly.
Yeah, I saw that.

I didn't know that she would be prone to hysteria.
She could become violent.

Where is the sedation kit?
I'll go get it now.

What' going on?
What's happening?

What's going on?
What's happening?

The door won't open.
Is there a key?

It's not locked,
it just won't open.

I want to see the footage from this room
first thing in the morning.

Kate, open the door!
Please.

Kate?
Kate?

Are you okay?

I feel wonderful.
It finally happened.

Day 3

Kate, what happened to your arms?
Did you do this to yourself?

Don't be ridiculous.

You know what, guys?
I think we're done here.

I am considering emitting
you to the hospital.

No, you don't decide
when this is over.

Actually, I do.

One phone call and the police will be here
to escort you to the hospital.

You just try it and
see what happens.

We're not going to stop
just because you...

Excuse me,
I'm talking to my patient.

Dr. Hatcher?

Yes, what is it?
You need to take a look at this.

That's not right.

Has anyone tempered with this equipment?
Of course not.

What's going on?

The machine is not
recording your heartbeat.

Demons don't have heartbeats.

Don't be ridiculous.

Do we have an extra monitor?
No.

What?

Your don't have a heartbeat.

I'm going to call Sam about
getting some new equipment.

Eddie, I would like to
speak to you in private.

What kind of game
are you playing?

Game? What the hell
are you talking about?

You think this is a joke?

Oh, I see.

Have you run into something you can't explain
with your fancy medical degree?

Ben. Can I have you
back in here, please.

We are not through here.

It's normal.

Exactly.
Everything is normal.

What was it like?

What?
The possession.

You said that the demon came last night.
What was it like?

It's like being touched by fire.

Where's the demon now?

Inside of me.

I don't feel good.
I need to lie down.

Are you okay?
I'm fine.

I just need to lie down.

I know you can't get this on camera,
but believe me the smell is disgusting.

I don't understand.

How can all the food
go bad all at once?

No clue.

It was fine yesterday.

You know what?
I'll finish this up.

Sarah. Why don't you go
get some groceries.

Are you sure?
Here.

I'll go with you.

Help you carry the bags.

Okay, sure.

Like I said.
She's a peach.

So. What's going on with Kate?

She's a little warm.

What does that mean?

It means she has a fever.

I hope she is up soon.

Sicken pigeons ain't as interesting
as satanic symbols on the wall.

You're crazy, Stu.

It's a true story.

What did you all get?

Some fruit and stuff,
a peach for one.

I can see your cards.

It doesn't matter.
You suck at poker.

Oh, yeah. Well, it
doesn't matter, because

this pot is coming home
with me.

Ah.
Shit.

I am a poker god.

You really are a shitty winner.

Alright.
Deuces wild and two down.

Deal me in.

Deal me in.

Okay, sure.

Aren't you going to
look at your cards?

No.
I know what they are.

3 of clubs, King of diamonds.
Yeah, right.

Okay.
Try that again.

Jack of heartsâ™¥

Lucky.

Queen of diamonds.

Damn.

6 of hearts â™¥

5 of spades.

Nice trick.

2 of clubs.

No.

2 of clubs.

No, you got it wrong.

That card is the 2 of clubs.
It isn't.

You're lying, Stu.
I'm not.

Are you trying to make
a fool of me?  Huh?

You think this is your big break,
you piece of shit.

Where are you going?
I'm out of here. I'm leaving.

Wherever you go,
they'll find you.

What the fuck
are you talking about?

Your gambling debts.

How'd you knew about that?

Okay.

How much are you in for?
I think we have enough for one night.

You don't have... You have no idea...
Stu, calm down.

You told her, didn't you?

Of course not.
Come on, man.

This is bullshit.
This is fucking bullshit!

So, Ben.

Tell me about your sister.
What?

You heard me.
How did your sister kill herself?

Oh, by the way. You might just
want to go ahead and fuck Stu.

Because it's all he thinks about.

And he really can't do
very well at his job.

Kate, we should get you to bed.

You know, suicide is a sin.
Kate.

Don't you, altar boy.
Stop this.

You know what they do
to pretty girls in hell?

Kate, enough.

I don't-I don't feel right.

Maybe we would just go?

No.

If they are playing a joke on us,
this is a waste of our time.

I don't know if it's a joke.

If that woman really needs my help,
we need to stay.

 We can't just leave her alone
with these vultures.

What if she's in on it?
No, she is not in on it.

They're indulging her,
feeding her fantasy.

Then, why don't we
just get rid of them?

One reason I'm not getting rid of them
right now is what it would do to Kate.

She needs to move
past Jesse's death.

This whole thing
is part of that process.

What's Kate?

She's sleeping.
What do you want?

I got proof she ain't crazy.

Really?
Show him, Stu.

Crazy, right?

Let me ask you a question?
Yeah, sure.

How stupid do you think I am?
You got to be fucking kidding me.

What? You don't
believe your own eyes?

No.
I don't believe you.

You don't believe me. Then,
what do you think is going on?

I think you are taking advantage of that
poor woman with your stupid parlor tricks.

She is clearly mentally ill.

So that makes your little magic show
not only unethical, it's illegal.

Hey, you know...

When this is all done.

I'm going to have the police
confiscate your footage.

And I'm pressing charges.

We're not dealing with
a crazy woman anymore.

We're dealing with a fucking demon.
Exactly.

This is not a documentary about
the mother of the Butcher.

She was right. It was a demon.
Eddie! He wants to send us to jail.

Don't worry about it.

No. No.
I'm done. I'm leaving.

We can 100% prove that
the devil exist and you want to quit?

You step one foot out of that door
and you're not getting a fucking dime.

And when they come to collect,
I'm not going to bail you out.

You are a son of a bitch,
you know that.

Just looking out for you.

Day 4

What's that?
Rehydration fluid.

How are you feeling, Kate?
Are you going to fuck him?

Excuse me?

You have a real soft spot
for losers, don't you.

I guess you're feeling better.
Much.

He calls you a peach.
You know that, right?

You heard him say that?
Of course.

Because you eat a peach real slow
and when you're done,

drop it in the trash.
And Sarah.

I appreciate it if you tell him to keep
his vulgar comments to himself.

Ready to get this
legendary moment on camera?

<i>Sarah, I want to feel my cock
in your mouth...</i>

Ah.

Don't ever come fucking near me again.
Any of you, you hear!

So. How did it go?

Fuck off, man.
Ha ha ha.

Just turn the fucking camera off.



Ben kicked us out.

Go see what you can get
from outside.

I want to ask you
a few questions.

Quid pro quo.
You answer my question, I answer yours.

Okay.

Your sister's in hell,
you know that, right?

Is that you question?
No.

My question is,
do you miss her?

Of course.

She misses you.
She needed you, Ben.

She called out for you
when she was dying.

Okay, my turn.

Shoot

Who am I talking to right now?
Isn't it obvious?

Why aren't you
answering my question.

Do you really want me
to answer your question?

Do you really want to know
who you're talking to?

I don't think you do.

Because if you knew
who I really was...

... it would destroy that lie you
tell yourself that let you sleep at night.

You know what I think, Kate?

What?

I think you want to believe
that you are possessed.

Because if you're possessed,
your son is innocent.

Oh, he was innocent, alright.
That's what made it so sweet.

It was so much fun just to hear
him wailing and crying in prison.

He was so confused.

You know in prison they can corrupt the body
in ways you wouldn't even think were possible.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

You want to know what
they did to him in prison?

No.
I don't.

That can't be real.
Un fucking believable.

How'd you guys do it?
Do what?

The paint.

What're you talking about?
We didn't paint anything.

What are you doing?
Moving on, Ben.

I'm done grieving.
What do you mean?

Just doing what you said.

I want to talk to you, Eddie.

It looked real.
It was coming from the painting.

Are you sure it looked real?

But, trust me,
it's not.

It's a magic trick.
Okay?

I like you, Eddie.

And I want to make sure
this little project of yours

is everything you want it to be.

Thanks, Kate.
I appreciate that.

Don't call me Kate.
You know I'm not Kate.

Okay, sure.

I've been talking to a few
colleagues at the hospital.

Kate is clearly developing
some kind of delusional disorder.

We need to commit her.
Okay. When?

Tomorrow morning.

You just keep the cameras rolling and
I'll promise I won't harm a hair on you head.

Deal?
Deal.

Excellent.
Here's to good TV.

What's going on?

I need you to stay out of our way,
or this officer will arrest you.

What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

Joey, Stu. Make sure
you get every bit of this.

You are not putting this on tape.
The hell I'm not.

You're about to violate
my civil rights.

This isn't about you, you moron.
We're taking Kate to the hospital.

What's the charge?

Where is Sarah?
Sarah!

Sarah, will you please help them
if they need assistance?

Okay, Kate's outside.
You have the sedation kit?

Thanks.

Officer, I can handle this.

But, please feel free to arrest
any of these gentlemen

if they take 1 step
outside of that door.

Good morning, Ben.
Good morning, Kate.

What is she doing?

Didn't your sister, Mia,
shoot herself in the head?

Kate. We need to take you to
the hospital for further testing.

Okay, you might as well.
It's already over.

Get ready.

Sarah!

Sarah.

Put it down.
I can't, Ben! I can't!

She's in my head! Get
her out of my head!

Just put the gun down.

Can we talk about it?
No, it hurts. It hurts.

I have to turn it off!
I have to turn it off.

No, Sarah.

No.

NO!

Okay, guys.

We need to go.

Come on.

CHURCH OF GOD

Why don't we just
turn her to the cops?

Because I don't want
more people to get killed.

You really think
Tomlin can help her?

I don't think anyone else can.

So, you are a believer?

Sarah would never
do that to herself.

<font color="#cb9696">God
bless our
Home</font>

Who is it?
It's Ben. Ben Hatcher.

So she succeeded?
Yes.

I warned you, son.

I know.

Can you help her?

Where is she?
She's in the car.

Okay, I'll prepare.

Give me the camera.
You open it.

Insurance.

Okay, Joey.

Hey? What, what!
Grab her.

Joey.
Shit.

Shit. Joey.
No, no, no, no.

Shit.

Untie me, Eddie.

You said you just wanted me to film.
That was the deal.

I'm going to enjoy peeling
the flesh from your bone.

And I thought you were
going to let me live.

That was before you disappoint me.

In case you hadn't noticed.

There is one and a half
priest in the next room.

I have seen the movies.

All I have to do is wait,
and I'll get my happy ending.

Don't talk to her, Eddie.

It about time, Father.
I've wanted to catch up.

I'm glad you're filming this.

No one would believe it
if we didn't have it on camera.

I have something I
want to tell you, Ben.

Kate's still here,
behind the body.

Ben, please help me!
Ben, please. Please help me!

Yes, tell them how he failed you.

Oh!
You, son of a bitch!

Everything has consequences, demon.

I can't stand by while you
torment this child of God.

I'm not tormenting her.

I'm just raping her soul.

No, I'll find your name.

Why does it matter?
Every demon has it's weaknesses.

We find it's name,
that's how we defeat it.

I have no weaknesses, Father.

No, you sound overconfident for
somebody strapped to a bed.

Still doing therapy, Ben?

What's your diagnosis?
Daddy issues?

It's obvious. Hubris is your weakness.
Exactly, it thinks it knows everything.

Well.
I'll tell you what I do know.

I'm going to corrupt this body
and then this soul

and you're going to watch,
helpless.

In the name of Jesus Christ,
tell us your name!

How about you just guess?

Dominus imperat vobis.
(The Lord commands you.)
Tell us your name!

The Lord commands you.

You wish to know my name?

Throughout time I have
collected many names.

The Lord commands you.
Shut up!

Tell us your name.
NO!

The Lord commands you.
NO!

The Lord commands you!

Nooooo!

The Lord commands you!

TELL US YOUR NAME!

You wish to know my name?

Throughout time I have
collected many names.

In this century, in this place,
you know me as Satan.

But you know me as the Butcher.

Last time you were excommunicated.
This time you'll die.

Run away!
I know where I'll find you!

What's going on?

It's the same demon

The same on who had Jesse.
The exact same one.

Maybe the thing was lying.
You don't understand.

It knows Kate.
Maybe that was Kate talking.

No, you don't understand.

A demon can't lie about it's name.
Why not?

When god created the universe,

he gave man dominion
over all of the angels.

Satan is a fallen angel.

We can command a demon even as
powerful as him to do our bidding.

So, if we ask him
to reveal his name, he must.

Oh god.

Father Tomlin.

You're the last remaining
hope for Kate.

I have done what I could,
but I have reached my limits.

Now, If you don't do
anything to help her,

there is no one else who can.

I think we should leave.

What?
She committed murder, Ben.

We have it on camera.
She needs to go to prison.

That's not Kate.
Kate would never...

How the hell do you know
what Kate would do?

She's the one who
wanted to be possessed.

Now I say,
she got what she wanted.

We're not leaving
until this is over.

None of us!
Whatever. Try and stop me.

You don't get it, do you?

There is no where you can go
where he won't find you.

There is no escape from this!
Your coward!

I can't believe he puts his
fucking hands on me, man. Fuck!

Hell, no.
Uh uh.

He ain't getting away
with that shit.

I'm not going to die like this.
Fuck.

Come on, Eddie.
Think, think, think, think, think.

I wonder if this
fucking door is open.

Hello, Eddie.

You're going to exorcise me on your own?
No.

Then what do you want?

I'm going to cut you loose.

Know what?
I'm not going nowhere.

But you said you wanted me to untie you.
That was then.

If you want to get out of this,

your hands are going to
have to get a little dirty.

What do you want?

Kill the priest,
and the good doctor too.

I can't.
It's your choice.

If you want to live,
you know what you have to do.

You alright?
I'm fine.

Are you sure?
I'm fine.

Father?

I failed Jesse.

In the name of god,
let's save Kate.

That's my boy.

Lord, have mercy.
Christ, have mercy.

God, the son, redeemer of the world,
have mercy on us all.

From all evil, deliver us, oh Lord.
I can feel your fear.

You're afraid.
I can feel your fear.

Lord, save your servant, Kate.
I trust in you, oh Lord.

I'm not Kate.
I am Lucifer, the Morning Star.

You will remember my name forever.
For I shall burn it into your eyes.

And you will wear it as brand for
all eternity as you rot in hellfire.

What's happening?

Don't worry, son.
The demon's afraid.

He's trying to scare us.
I'm not afraid.

You are afraid.
You are a sorry to saintship.

I was afraid, but I fear no longer.
God is my helper.

The Lord sustains my life.

All 10 minutes is that
I'll laugh at your life.

Then I'll personally defile
your soul for all eternity.

Lord, save your servant, Kate.
Let the enemy have no power over her.

And the son of iniquity
be powerless to harm her.

It's no use, priest.

Lord, send your aid from your
holy place and watch over her.

Lord, heed my prayer.

It doesn't matter.

You will fail because you're
an insect before my power.

You are nothing more
than an insect.

And he is coming and he
will return you to hell...

Kill !

Kill ! Kill !
Ah!

I'm sorry, Ben.
I had to do it.

No!

What would Mia say if
she could see you like this?

Shut your mouth.

Suicide is a sin.
Don't you fucking say another word.

You know what they do
to pretty girls in hell?

How could you do this?

A demon like me
is responsible for Mia too.

You're not going to win this.
You can end it.

Take the knife
and finish it.

That's right...

You heard me, old man.
There's no getting rid of me.

What If I call the cops?

Sure, call the cops.

There's nothing I like more than a
more bodies to rip apart.

You can't escape everytime.

Eventually, you'll wind
up in jail, like Jesse.

No, I won't.
Kate will.

She will rot in the cell until they drag her
kicking and screaming to legal injection.

And I'll find someone else.

There are far more
deserving souls in prison.

Take the knife and finish this.
It's the only way to set Kate free.

What's with you?

I can't murder you.

What're you going to do now?
Sit around? Until this body rots?

No.

No.

When time began,
the word was there.

And the word was
face to face with God.

And the Word was God!

Not this again.

How about you untie me.
I got some place I need to be.

Silence, demon.

Oh!
Silence, demon!

You sound like Father Tomlin.

I want you to take me.

Excuse me.

Can you think of a
better vessel to corrupt?

Can you imagine how much power
you would have using my soul.

You would do that for Kate
after everything she's done?

I walk this path myself.

I could have ended this.

All of this.

But I'm going to fix it.

You don't know what you're asking.

I command you to possess my soul.

Ben?

Oh, Ben. You poor fool.
You thought you could control me.

Dr. Hatcher...
Gaze upon your first victim.

The woman you sacrificed your soul for.

You killed him!
You killed my baby!

You killed my baby!

Kate.

Sorry, Ben.
It had to be done.

That's the proof.

To the families of those who were
hurt in order to make this video,

Your loved ones were
martyred in truest sense.

Their sacrifices made, so that
the world would know the truth.

That my son Jesse, was innocent.

The infamous Kate Winters' video
continues to make headlines tonight.

State and federal law enforcement officials
are combing through the video

to find out if the
gruesome footage is real,

and to determine if there have
been any other victims

besides those depicted in the footage.

Kate Winters, the mother of the
infamous serial killer, The Butcher,

is wanted for questioning.

But, so far there are no leads
as to her whereabouts.

Kerry Marshall has the story.

I'm standing outside the now
vacant home of Kate Winters,

mother of the Butcher.

In week following the release of her
disturbing and violent documentary,

no one has seen
nor heard from her.

News team 8 took to the streets
to find out what do you think.

I think it's real.
I just don't see how it could be fake.

So, you believe that this is
definitive proof of the Devil?

Well. If the devil does exist, 
then he isn't hiding it.

She used to be such a 
wholesome community, right?

Are you concerned for
your family's safety?

Absolutely. I don't think the cops are 
doing near enough to find this woman.

I mean, why is she still out there?
Why is she still on the loose?

It is absolutely a fake.

Have you heard a little movie 
called "Paranormal Activity"?

Because it's basically the same thing.

Police have reported that the people
in the video are missing.

So? That doesn't mean it's not 
some kind of elaborate prank.

I mean,

if you were going to kill a bunch of people, 
you wouldn't put it on camera..

Do you think the 
Kate Winters' video is real?

Oh, absolutely, I do.
Very much so.

All of it? 
The murders, the supernatural part?

Absolutely. 
Let me read something to you,

as from the Book of Revelation.

And the fifth angel sounded,

and I saw a star fallen from 
heaven unto the earth:

and to him was given 
the key to the bottomless pit.

That's the beginning of the end times.
And we are there, we're in Revelation today.

We're living it. 
We're breathing it.

This video is real and it is the
beginning of something beautiful.

My friends and I think it's real.

I mean, her son killed all those people, 
why wouldn't she do it.

At this point, we're not going to release 
a statement on an open investigation.

We can say that the footage 
is being analyzed very carefully.

The people in the video
have been reported missing.

We will exhaust all efforts to locate them 
before opening any type of investigation.

We reached out to the local diocese 
of the Catholic Church for comment.

But, so far have
received no response.

For Channel 8 News,
I'm Kerry Marshall.

Back to you, Graham.

Thank you, Kerry.

We'll have more for you
as the story unfolds.

I'm Graham Ulkins, 
for Channel 8 News.
