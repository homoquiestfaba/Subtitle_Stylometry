-Hello?
-So what do you think?

-About what?
-About tomorrow.

lt's our first day of high school.

lf we want to be popular,
we just have to be proactive.

Calm your proactive ass down.

Saying you want to be popular
guarantees it isn't gonna happen.

I'm gonna get a girIfriend.
You think that's possibIe?

Anything's possibIe, Wade.

Just don't be needy.

<i>Y</i>ou got to let it come to you.
And one more thing.

From now on,
I don't want you caIIing me Ryan.

CaII me T-Dog.

-T-Dog?
-Yep.

-What does the ''T'' stand for?
-l don't know.

-But it sounds better than R-Dog.
-<i>Y</i>eah.

You know, Iike, if a hot girI
went up to you, and she goes,

''Hey, have you met T-Dog?
Man, did you see what T-Dog did today?

''Man, that T-Dog is crazy!''

That sounds like a guy
every woman would want to know.

-Hey, do I need a nickname?
-You have one. SkeIetor.

That was Iast year.
I Iook good now. I'm fiIIing out.

AII right, name one part of your body
that fiIIed out, Wade.

Name one part of your body
that isn't fiIIed out, huh?

I'm not trying to offend you.

l'm just saying you shot up too fast
and you're freakishly skinny.

Oh, yeah? WeII, you're too fat
and that's equaIIy unattractive.

-You wanna go there?
-I'm sorry.

It's just, I want things to go weII,
you know?

-Sorry I said you're freakishIy skinny.
-It's okay.

<i>Y</i>ou just are.

Hey, go to sIeep!
It's 3:00 in the morning!

-What are you, crazy?
-Sorry.

-ls that your stepdad?
-No one.

-Give me that phone! Give it!
-It's...

<i>Y</i>ou're in high school now.
Don't take his...

Go to sIeep.

How about some
chicks on the waIIs in here?

It's Iike a nerd paradise.

Time to make the donuts.

Hoo-rah!

Touchdown!

We won! We won the game!
And Wade Ioses again!

-Get out of my room!
-Dad said get up.

He's not my dad. He's your dad.

Fine, the guy who does your mom
says get up.

-Just Ieave!
-Loser!

Morning, sunshine. First day of schooI.

-Mom!
-Oh, my God!

Since when did you start
sIeeping naked?

I'm in high schooI now,
don't you remember?

I don't Iike eIastic squeezing
on my ass when I sIeep!

Okay.

Hey! What are you doing
in this shower?

Dawn? RacheI, that's right.
Nice to see you.

Put your hands up
Put your hands up

l'm the best white rapper
you've ever seen

A hair!

-Oh, my God!
-Look at that.

Thank you, Iadies!

What's up, winners? You stoked?
PedaI to the metaI?

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

AII right. Who's a winner?

-I am!
-I am!

Morning!

-Look at you, with your magic stick.
-What do you think?

Magic is stupid.

No, no, honey.

-Mom!
-What?

You forgot the sausages!

-I'II get the sausages.
-Come on. I'm hungry.

AII right, I'II get the sausages.

Excuse me, Iisten,
I'm reaIIy sorry to bother you.

My famiIy and I, we just ran out of gas

and we're trying to get to the kids
to SeaWorId.

And, I, Iike an idiot forgot my waIIet.
If I can just...

-Your Iegs work okay?
-Yeah, why?

You shouId waIk somewhere
and get a job.

-HaroId...
-I'II take care of it.

That's what I have, a job.

We'II get to SeaWorId
one way or the other.

We're on our way to church.
Maybe that's where you ought to go.

Thank you. Have a great day.

-Can you heIp out a veteran?
-Not today.

-Get away from the car.
-Honey, roII up the window.

Get away!

-What's your name?
-DriIIbit.

Listen, DriIIbit, I wasn't born yesterday.

I don't want you using this on
any marijuana or rye whiskey, okay?

-You got my word on it.
-You know what?

-I'm gonna write ''not for pot'' on there.
-You don't have to write.

Yeah. ''Not for pot.''

You're gonna feeI pretty siIIy if you try
to buy weed with that, won't you?

Remember, put your best foot forward.

PeopIe decide what they think about you
in the first five seconds.

So, Iet me smeII your breath.

Minty.

-You swipe on some deodorant?
-Yeah.

-You dust the nuts?
-No, Jim. I did not dust my nuts.

I'II never get tired of that one, Dad.

You know, you shouId hit the weights
with the boys and me.

-I'II pass.
-We'II get you in the gym.

We'II beef you up. Look at these guys.
Show them. Give him a gun shot.

Give him a crab.

Worship the sun.

-Yeah, Iook at these guys.
-They're freaks.

Not in my house!

-Have a great day.
-Okay, I Iove you, Dad.

l love you, too.
Have fun at school, Ryan. Bye.

-So what'd your dad say?
-He toId me to have fun.

Wow, great parenting.

I don't know how
we're surviving without him.

-Sorry.
-It's okay.

-He's a piece of shit, anyway.
-Thank you, honey.

-EnchantÃ©.
-HeIIo.

You got room for two
in this IittIe speedster?

I am in a rush now. But I hostess up
at Moon Shadows on the one.

So if you get up there just, you know,
ask for me. I'm Jessica.

-Thanks, Jessica.
-Yeah.

'Cause our chef, Louis,
aIways makes too much chowder.

So he'II set you up with
a nice pIastic bowI of it out back.

-You're Iate today.
-Hey, get a job!

-You get a job.
-I aIready got one, giving money to you.

-How're you doing, Mrs. LampaneIIi?
-AII right.

-You Iook beautifuI today.
-You're a Iiar. But it works for me.

-Go on, get out of here, you nut!
-You earned it.

And don't spend it on food. Porn onIy!

First day of high schooI.

-It's kind of scary.
-Yeah, it sucks taking the bus.

Sure, Iast year we were the oIdest
so we got to sit in the back of the bus,

but now we'II probabIy have to sit
in the front with the Iosers.

We'II be aII right.

You have to have a proactive attitude
if you wanna be popuIar in high schooI.

PeopIe decide what they think of you
in the first five seconds.

I think you're a dork.

Oh, Wade.

-Oh, no.
-This is uncooI.

We can't start high schooI Iike this.

You got to be shitting me. Come on.

-PIease, am I dreaming here?
-No.

We're never aIIowed
to buy the same shirt again!

Whoever sees it first gets to buy it.

You guys shouId wear
red ribbons in your hair, too.

See? We both Iook Iike dorks.
Go change.

No! I'm the one who was
pIanning on wearing this.

Wade, I run the miIe in 21 minutes!

How fast do you think I can go?

-Go! Hurry!
-I'm going!

Wade, bus!

-Perfect!
-Come on!

What a way to start high schooI, huh?

Let me guess.
Two-for-one saIe at Hot Topic?

-Losers!
-Dorks!

We're dead.

First day of our high schooI careers.

AII right, Iet's Iight this fuse
and see what happens.

-Let's go, man.
-AII right.

Are you guys part of a bowIing team?

Last one.

Hey, at Ieast it'II be easy
to find each other.

Yeah. I'II just Iook
for the kid with the same shirt.

-Come on!
-No, you have to spin it a few times first

to get it to work.

Thank you.

No, wait! Wait!

-What are you guys doing? Guys!
-Now, shut it. Move!

-No, thanks.
-Guys!

-Get out of the way!
-Man!

-Here we go.
-But that... That's not for me.

-That's for my books!
-Okay, here we go.

-In there.
-I am not a book!

-Get in there!
-This is bad.

-This isn't my Iocker! PIease!
-No, this is good.

At Ieast we know we're not
the biggest dorks in schooI.

-PIease, pIease, pIease!
-Maybe we shouId say something.

It's survivaI of the fittest.

I've got to say something.
I got to. I have to.

Say something? It's hiIarious.
The kid fits in the Iocker. Come on.

-That's not funny.
-Somebody, heIp!

This is the dumbest thing
I've ever done.

-HeIp! PIease!
-Stop!

-I mean, you don't have to, but...
-Harry Potter.

You need to keep your big mouth shut.

Yeah, that's what
I've been trying to teII him.

-Hey!
-Run! Everybody run! It's not safe here!

Hey, check this out.
Matching shirt geeks.

Oh, my God.

Yo, Ron, these bitches
reaIIy wanna wear the same shirt.

Let's make them
wear the same shirt, huh?

Sounds good. Yeah.

The fat one here, the skinny one there,
and just Iet go.

There.

You better keep that shit on,

'cause if I see you trying to take it off,
you're dead.

And you know what happens
if one of you dies? Both of you dies.

'Cause you're Siamese queers, bitches!

That's very cute.

You Iook Iike those VeIcro monkeys
who hug each other.

How was schooI, Wade?

We made so many friends,
I can't even remember aII their names.

-Great! You got to be in it to win it.
-I am in it!

Great.

Yeah!

-Yeah.
-So schooI went weII, huh?

Oh, it was great.
It couIdn't have gone better.

It was the shirt, right?
I'II have to get you more of those.

Hey! What are you doing?
That's my stuff!

This is city property.

Nobody's supposed to be
camping out here.

Your stuffs in the dumpster
around the corner.

That's where I eat! You don't put
a man's beIongings where he eats!

-My taxes pay for your saIary.
-You don't pay taxes.

-You don't even have a job.
-What eIse you wanna remind me of?

That I don't have good heaIth care?
That I don't beIong to a good gym?

Where's the compassion?
Protect and serve. That's what it says.

-Compassion?
-Yeah, compassion.

You wanna know
what I have compassion for?

The homeIess who are mentaIIy iII,
the homeIess who are drug-addicted.

Buddy, you're just a jackass.

Oh, guy hits a IittIe bit of bump
in the road and he's a jackass?

Maybe I shouId go smoke some crack
and get your sympathy.

-Go back to the ViIIage PeopIe!
-Back up!

Damn!

AII right, today is the first day
of our high schooI careers.

Yes, it is.

There she is.

That's the girI who came up to me
at my Iocker.

-WeII, make your move.
-What move? I don't have a move.

AII right, thanks for signing up.

How're you doing?

Is this your first time signing up
for the Heritage CIub?

-Yeah, it is. Okay, bye.
-Bye.

What'd you sign up for?

-Photography and Asian Heritage.
-Asian Heritage, huh?

-I Iike your commitment.
-Yeah.

-I Iike it a Iot.
-Hey, buddies! Remember me?

-Hi.
-Oh, Jesus H.

Oh, God.

Guys, why aren't you wearing them?

-Why are you taIking to us?
-I just wanted to say thank you

for heIping me out yesterday and aII.

You guys are definiteIy the type of
peopIe I'm gonna want to hang out with.

-Yeah.
-Hi, I'm Emmit Oosterhaus, by the way.

-Hi.
-Wade. That's T-Dog.

T-Dog? Dude,
that's a reaIIy cooI nickname.

Hey, can you guys give me a nickname?

We need to ditch this guy.
He's Iike a stray cat.

Once you feed him,
he'II never go away, okay?

Hey, no secrets, T-Dog.

I'm off to U.S. History.

-U.S. History.
-Hey, Iook!

The Siamese queers had a baby.

I guess that makes them tripIets,
now doesn't it?

WeII, actuaIIy,
we stiII wouIdn't be tripIets, see.

You see, they'd be my parents,
and I'd be the baby.

Don't get smart with me.

I said you're tripIets and I think that
you guys need to get into his shirt

-and be tripIets.
-We can do that.

You know what? Emmit, shut up.

Look, you reaIIy have to
do this crap, guys?

Come on, give us a break.
It's the second day of schooI.

Hey, I Iike this kid. Yeah.

DoubIe Stufs got an attitude.

Yeah. We have to do this shit
because it's hiIarious.

This schooI is boring.

Watching you freak out amuses me.

And, yeah, it's just the second day
of schooI. So guess what?

It's gonna keep coming
and coming and coming!

Party time!

-Stop peeing on me!
-Wait! Wait! No!

He pissed himseIf. What a Ioser.

HeIp.

HeIp me!

-Is that Mario Lopez, dude?
-Whoever he is, he's cute!

Take his pants off! Pants off!

-Up, down, up...
-Write your name!

No! PIease, don't! No! Don't!

Bernie?

-Come on, give me one match, here.
-That's funny.

-AII I need is one.
-Yeah, I Iike it.

-WiII you just give up?
-Damn it! Look at that.

God, I can't even get one card!
Not one thing!

State of CaIifornia just robbed me, Don.
You saw it.

You'd think... Where's my quarter?
Did you see my...

-You're aIways Iooking at me.
-Is the piII bottIe... I forget,

-is that the castIe or is that a rook?
-Don, did you just take my quarter?

No, I didn't take your quarter, DriIIbit.

Not my fauIt you can't keep track
of your finances.

I don't know why you're spending aII
your money on this dumb stuff, anyway.

You're unbeIievabIe.
I got to get out of here.

You know,
I can't take this anymore, man.

Rich peopIe don't Iike us,

and the tourists are scared of us.

-When they see Bernie, they're terrified.
-Terrified.

They're not scared of me, I'm sexy.

-Sanitizer?
-Yeah.

Yeah. Thanks, man.

I just get... I'm Iike a bird.
I just wanna fIy north. I want to...

I'd Iike to go to Canada.

What was it Iast year? I think it was,

-''I was gonna go to IceIand.''
-ReykjavÃ­k.

-No, no.
-Where's that?

Yeah, but the thing about Canada,
if you go high enough north...

-That's right.
-...the government pays you

-to take the Iand.
-That's the truth.

Yeah. Lookit, man,
the beer's twice as strong.

They don't Iock the doors,
that shouId appeaI to a man Iike you.

And what about
a British CoIumbian girI?

Does that sound Iike
a pretty potent mix?

Yeah, that's not too bad.
I kind of Iike that.

Okay, now, man, check this out.

One-way fIight to Canada, $287.

You got to throw in 50 bucks for bribing,
what're they caIIed,

-the FederaIes, the...
-Mounties.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Mounties.

Another...
I want a good winter jacket, 80 bucks.

So we're taIking $387 and it's a new
Iife for your oId hombre, DriIIbit.

I dig it, man. FoIIow the dream.
Chase that thing.

How you gonna come up
with that kind of money, though?

Get a job.

I was an Army Ranger.
There are a Iot of peopIe dying for that.

Watch this kid pIay Hendrix.
He reaIIy jams. Look at him.

Oh, yeah, there he goes.

Yeah, I Iike how he Iooks
a IittIe bit Iike Hendrix.

Yeah! I'm gonna give him a buck.

-I'II give him a coupIe bucks.
-A buck? Give him a compIiment, man!

Give me a buck!

Why is he in my house?

Are we trying to attract
after-schooI buIIies?

I'm here because
Wade invited me to be here.

Because I'm your friend now.

This fantasy Iand you Iive in,
Emmit, are there rides?

Stop picking on him, aII right?
This is our guy.

I don't want him to be our guy.

WeII, the good news is, I think I found
a soIution to our probIems.

-KiII Emmit?
-No, bear with me.

This might sound stupid,
but I was on the Internet Iast night

and there's a bunch of sites where
we can hire a professionaI bodyguard.

-What do you mean by bodyguard?
-Like he beats up kids that bother us.

A bodyguard? Wade,
that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.

We shouId just be men
and fight these kids!

Are you serious?

Of course not. I've never been in a fight.

Have you seen those
high schooI fights on YouTube?

Kids are brutaI.

He gave us an earthquake
when we were peeing in the urinaI.

He shoved me in a Iocker.

And he put my head in his shirt
and caIIed us Siamese queers.

How's that funny?

It's not funny. It's just, it's rare that,

you know,
kids say things that surprise me.

Siamese queers.
I'd never heard that one.

-What wouId you Iike me to do?
-We reaIIy just want it to stop.

So are they pretty much free to say
whatever they want?

Or am I aIIowed to defend myseIf?

Oh, no. PrincipaI DoppIer,
I thought this was gonna be anonymous.

In this country, we give the accused
the chance to face his accusers.

Terry, come over here for a second,
wiII you?

Now we've known each other for...
Yeah, have a seat.

-What's your take on this?
-Hey, guys, hey. How's it going?

Be poIite! There you go.

-Wade.
-Hi.

Hey, T-Dog. Give me a pound.

Yeah. PrincipaI DoppIer, sir,
I was reaIIy excited

about starting this new schooI year.
I'm not gonna Iie.

Who knows?
I, maybe, was hazing them a IittIe bit,

but I'm sorry.

I reaIIy am.

You know, I appreciate you taking
responsibiIity. It's refreshing.

-He doesn't mean it!
-We need to caII his parents in.

-Now.
-He doesn't have any parents.

WeII, not in this country, anyway.
They Iive in Hong Kong.

-He's an emancipated minor.
-What does that mean?

It means he's IegaIIy an aduIt.

He answers to no one.

He's above the Iaw.

-What a nightmare, huh?
-Yeah.

Oh, crap.

Oh, no.

-Run.
-Go! Go!

-Run! Go, go!
-Hurry.

Wait for me!

Go, go!

-Do you think he sees us?
-No.

Open the door! Open the door!

What do they want?

Just keep driving, Mom.
It's none of our business.

Let's go, Iet's go!

Have you guys Iost your mind?
Come on, Iet's go!

Go, go, come on!

-Come on.
-Oh, no!

-Run! Run!
-Go!

Get them, baby!

There! The garage!

You gonna rat on me, boys?

Try to get my parents invoIved
in this situation?

Now I have to make it my mission
to destroy you punks!

Hey! You kids get the heII off
my property!

I'm gonna give you three seconds,
then I'm getting my shotgun!

-No!
-You better get out of here right now!

-PIease don't!
-No! PIease!

One! Two! Three!

-Go! Go!
-And stay out, you gang bangers!

CharIes, chai Iatte up.

-Hey! Get off my computer!
-Keep your shirt on.

Come on.

If this doesn't work,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

When it works,
you're going to kiss my ass.

How are we gonna know
which one's the bodyguard?

Have you ever done
this kind of thing before?

I worked for the hardest gangstas
in the worId.

Kee Lo-Lo, Chenobee.

HeII, I stiII work for Tupac,
even though he dead.

I am IsraeIi MiIitary Secret Service
Antiterrorist Squad.

So when I kiII this kid,
do you want me to do it quickIy,

-or do you want him to suffer?
-Suffer.

If you hire Tiger's Protection Services,

not onIy do you get the Tiger,

but you get the protection
of his entire pride.

Do you Iike hip-hop?

What the heII you impIying
I Iike hip-hop for?

'Cause I'm dressed this way?
I Iike country. You Iike country?

That's the kind of music I Iike. AIabama.
Gimme some of that.

Some Brooks and Dunn.
The Dixie Chicks, bitch.

Kids hiring a bodyguard
to take care of a buIIy?

Stupidest thing I ever heard.

Back in my day, if a kid was getting
beat up, it was caIIed chiIdhood.

Pick somebody, anybody.
I'II go beat their ass

right here, right now, and then you can
ask them for a goddamned reference.

How about you, Iady?

I'II kick your ass right now!
CIose. CIosed.

-Yeah!
-This is very disturbing.

You want an ass kicking?

What do you do
when you're not body guarding?

I work at Raging Waters.

I sense great hesitation.
Wait one moment. Excuse me.

I'm going to borrow this.

-PIease don't do that.
-Oh, God damn!

-$2,100 a week.
-$10,000 a week.

-$2,100 a week.
-$10,000 a week.

We're hoping you'd say, Iike,
around $100.

-Not interested.
-I hate kids Iike you.

I can't heIp you. No one can heIp you!

-Susan, your doubIe espresso's up.
-I'm Susan.

I'm DriIIbit TayIor.

U.S. Army Ranger, bIack ops operative,
decorated marksman,

-improvised weapons expert.
-Are you stiII in the miIitary?

I was discharged.
Unauthorized heroism.

Yeah. They caII it an army of one
in the ads, but they don't mean it.

UnIess they mean the whoIe army
working together as one.

But they certainIy don't want one man
out there kicking ass

Iike an army of one,
which is the way I took it.

As a bodyguard
I protected three Vice Presidents,

Bobby Brown, SyIvester StaIIone...
Not as tough as he Iooks.

So what's the story?
Who do you guys need protection from?

It shouId be easy for you.
Just a high schooI buIIy.

Yeah. Run into a few of those in my Iife.

-What'd you do to provoke him?
-WeII, he's fat, and he's a dork,

-and I'm awesome.
-Shut up, Wade.

By ''awesome'' do you mean
scared, skinny and IoneIy?

Yeah.

Yeah.

-So how do we know you're Iegit?
-Come here. Go on, come here.

I'm not gonna bite.

I want you to Iook at my eyes.

Take a good Iook.

Come here! What do you see?
You Iooking?

-What the heII have you seen?
-You want some?

These eyes have seen
unspeakabIe horror.

That's my evidence.

That's how you know if a guy's Iegit.
You need some evidence, too?

I've seen things you wouIdn't beIieve.

I've watched C-beams gIitter in the dark
near the Tannhauser Gate.

Isn't that Blade Runner?

Look cIoseIy 'cause it's aII in there.

Boo!

So, how much do you charge?

$387 a week.

-One second.
-I say yes.

I'm not even sure if I'm avaiIabIe.

-He's good.
-No! No! He's weird.

You know, we might be abIe
to work up to that.

But right now, we've onIy got $83.

Okay, weII, give me that now
and we'II figure out the rest Iater.

You know what this is?

It's a wing.

And you're under it.
AII three of you, right there.

Okay, here's the mission pIan.

Using my expertise at steaIthy
and covert ops, I'II infiItrate the schooI

where I wiII watch over you
Iike the Lord aImighty himseIf.

CarefuI.

Like the good Lord,
I'm gonna use some mysterious ways,

so you're not aIways gonna see me,
but I'II be there.

EspeciaIIy when you don't see me.

But first, I'm gonna need some suppIies.

-I want to go in and get...
-Like nunchucks?

Maybe.

But a Iot of stuff, I'II just get from
just what's Iaying around the house.

You'd be surprised.

Anything can be turned into
a weapon of mayhem or destruction.

-Even a puppy?
-EspeciaIIy a puppy.

Germans used them in WorId War I.
Da Hunden Stormen. Lightning Dog.

They'd attach dynamite to them.
RommeI did it. Jerry bastard.

-Now, Iisten. One thing that...
-This is my house.

Wow.

-We can go in. Nobody's home.
-Let's hit it. DepIoy, soIdiers.

-SoIdiers? CooI. You hear that, T-Dog?
-BeeIine, front door! SingIe fiIe!

Officers first!

You, get me a bowI of cereaI.
Go on. Scram.

-Okay, this I'm gonna need. Right here.
-What for?

You take that,
my mom'II rip my head off!

At ease, Casper!

Okay. Observe its momentary
refIective bIinding capabiIities.

Bang! You're defenseIess.

SiIver aIIoy,
one of the strongest ever constructed.

ProbabIy stop an armor-piercing buIIet
at point-bIank range.

You don't reaIIy think
it couId come to that.

You teII me.

FiIkins is a whack job.
He aImost ran over us with his car!

-He's a menace.
-Yeah, I was my dad's favorite, too.

He once cut a kid's arm off
with a samurai sword.

-BIaded weaponry?
-Yeah.

Okay. I'm not gonna take any chances.
You're now on orange aIert.

Okay, now this wiII be good
for video surveiIIance.

This is good.

You take the guts out of this
and use it for wiretapping.

I think we can use this as a...
I don't know, as a timekeeping device.

I think I'II wear it on my wrist, possibIy.

You think you might need this?

This piece of crap's not worth anything.

As a weapon. It's too obvious.

Testing, one, two. Mister Taylor?

-Testing, one, two.
-Can you come back now?

Guys, you got to go far back!
I can hear you!

Testing, testing, one, two.
Can you hear me now?

-They work pretty good.
-These are great.

-Yeah.
-These are invaIuabIe.

-They get a IittIe staticky, though...
-Yeah.

...I think, some pIaces in the house.

Why you need aII this stuff for?

I thought we were gonna give
FiIkins a beat down.

I am gonna beat him down,

but sometimes
after that first beat down,

then they get a IittIe, you know...
They want a IittIe payback.

I'm home!
Who wants griIIed-cheese sandwiches?

-Go! Go! Mom! Mom!
-Okay.

-Exit! Exit!
-Go, out the back, out the back, go.

Just 'cause you don't see me
doesn't mean I'm not there.

-Shut the door.
-Act naturaI. Hey, Mom.

-Hey, Barbara, how you doing?
-Hi, boys.

-Who's your new IittIe friend? Hi.
-Hi.

-Hi. Emmit Oosterhaus.
-Hi, Emmit Oosterhaus.

-He's not our friend.
-Yeah, he is.

He's Iike our hamster.

SmeII Iike something?

-Ryan? You washing?
-Yeah. You?

It's a funny smeII. It's aII right.
GriIIed-cheese sandwiches.

Hey, come on! Buzz us in!

You're gonna wanna see this!

Big money coming in!

This ain't a bunch of
aIuminum cans here.

Where do you want it?
PriceIess treasures.

Go set them down there.

So you don't think those kids
are gonna miss this stuff?

No. They got two of everything.

They got the iPod, the iPod Nano.
And I don't care if they do,

'cause after this IittIe transaction,

weII, the oId DriIIbit's taking his act
to the Great White North.

-What?
-Yeah, I'm going to Canada.

WeII, that's stupid.
You're gonna cut out now?

-I'm going...
-These kids are a cash cow, DriIIbit.

You need to hang in there.
You don't cut and run.

You got to get in there and miIk this.

Okay, come on back.

AII right, I'II teII you what.
I give you $125 for the whoIe Iot.

What?

I just heard you say
you took it from some kids.

So? Don't get aII righteous on me.

HaIf this store you guys got
from crackheads and thieves.

Hey. Who the heII
do you think you are, man?

Let me teII you something.
Those peopIe are our customers!

We're not that harsh on them,
so you shouIdn't be!

How wouId you Iike it
if we caIIed you a crackhead?

You have caIIed me one.

-Have we? Have we?
-I think I might have.

-Drillbit? Drillbit? Come in.
-What is that?

I'm sorry, hoId it just a second.
D.B. one-four-niner-eight, come in.

-Just take this.
-We just wanted you to know

that Emmit was holding out
on some bar mitZvah money.

Emmit, l don't care how many times you
get bar mitZvahed, you're not a man.

-l am a man.
-No, you're not.

-DriIIbit! MiIk it, miIk it.
-So we'll have another 50 bucks for you

-on Monday.
-Grab the udder and miIk it.

Ten-four, good buddy.
I wiII see you tomorrow.

Commence radio siIence in three, two.

Today's the officiaI start
of our high schooI careers.

Last week's history.
Nothing good came out of Iast week.

-We became best friends.
-Nothing good came out of Iast week.

There's the sword. Man, we're so dead.

-Where's DriIIbit, Wade?
-Hey. CaIvary's here.

-PIease, where have you been?
-Yes. What's up, man?

Where's my money?
Where's my money?

We got 40 bucks we promised,
pIus we got an extra 1 7.

I soId my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

Okay, this is gonna be sweet.

I can't wait to watch
you kick FiIkins' ass.

I can't wait to watch
you kick FiIkins' ass.

-Yeah. What, is he here?
-Yeah, over there on his car.

I want you to be
the Iast face he ever sees.

What are you gonna do?

-What am I gonna do?
-Come on.

I want you to gnaw on his skuII.

-What's the pIan?
-Shut up.

Guys, I'm gonna check this dude out.

Yes.

Excuse me.

Yeah.

Just got to kind of stand here
for a second.

AII right. Hey, take it easy, man.

He's thin, but sinewy and muscuIar.

He's got a Iow center of gravity which
means he's fast Iike a jack rabbit.

He didn't take a shower today
or yesterday. He's got bad breath.

He's got a coupIe of cavities
which is not improving...

This is serious. I thought
you were gonna go kick his ass.

Yeah.

Look at Tommy Trigger Finger.
You want the bIood and the guts.

WeII, it doesn't work that way.

I can't just kick his ass.

PhysicaIIy, I can,
but if you kick a buIIy's ass,

then maybe you guys Iive tiII Iunchtime.

And then what?

''Teach those victims how to kick
the buIIy's ass and they Iive forever.''

Steven SeagaI.

So you're gonna teach us
how to beat him up?

-Like train us?
-So we're gonna beat up FiIkins?

What I'm about to show you are
top-secret bIack ops fighting moves.

And it's aII about technique.

I don't care if you're taIking about

karate, tai chi, kung fu, praying mantis,

kung pao, Panda Express.

It's aII about technique.
I want you to watch my technique.

It's pretty fIawIess.
Come on, Ryan, charge me.

I'm serious. Try to kiII me.

Come on. You ready?
Go! Yeah. Come on.

I got you!

I got you! I got you!

Damn it!

Okay. Tripped right there.
That was the bear hug.

Okay. Wade. Come on!

Here you go! Watch the eIbows!

Don't! Stop!

Okay. Last but not Ieast. Charge me.

Everyone, up! CircIe me!

Come on.
Let me see some fight from you.

Okay, you guys ready for the bIizzard?

-Go get him, boys!
-Yeah. Go, get it, aII three of you!

I caII truce! Truce! Back up! Three's
too many. Three's too many. Stop.

Wow, one of you
reaIIy charIey-horsed me.

Okay.
Now it isn't aII orientaI martiaI arts.

Sometimes you give
a IittIe Mexican judo as in

''Ju don't know who
you're messing with, homes.''

Come on, Ryan, one more. Last one!
Show me your mettIe. Come on! OlÃ©!

Wow!

Ryan!

Man down!

Ryan!

Was that my fauIt?

Hey! Check this out.

Dude! You feII Iike 60 feet.

Jeez, that was crazy.

What is this?

This is a strategic outpost.

I got these posted aII over the city.

Don't even Iook at it, okay?

Now Iet's get back up there
and get to work.

What's this for?
To wash your baIIs in the morning?

No. Look Iike a squeegee to you?

Or does it Iook Iike a weapon
with a straight edge

and a IittIe mop to cIean up the bIood?

T-Dog, Emmit, this way.

-Where's DriIIbit?
-I don't know.

-Wait up.
-ShouId be right up here.

Man down!

Take this.

-Take a swing at my head.
-Oh, no.

Wade, come on. Just hit me.

-But it'II hurt.
-Wade hit me.

-I'II do it.
-Shut up.

I feeI no pain,
'cause I have a trained mind.

-Go!
-Come on.

-Let's beat it.
-Come on, come on, come on, Iet's go.

-Hey, DriIIbit. We couId make s'mores!
-No.

-How much does a Hug Me Bear cost?
-No.

-Where'd you get the kids, DriIIbit?
-I won them in a poker game.

Order up!

-How's this part of the training?
-It's caIIed buIking up.

-I'm aIready fat.
-Hey. You're not fat.

I don't want to hear you say you're fat.

Words Iike Iard ass, fat pig, butterbaII,
IandsIide, mudsIide.

I don't want to hear that.
What are you tipping the scaIes at?

180.

What?

Whenever you're ready, boys.

Okay, one of you guys
got to pick this up,

'cause I'm stiII on the cIock.

FiIkins. FiIkins.

Avoidance technique!
Avoidance technique!

Come out here, Capone!
<i>Y</i>ou want to fight?

<i>Y</i>ou want to fight,
you and me, right here?

This is very important. See that?

What's the matter? Afraid to
come out from behind your men?

-He has a hoIdback guy.
-Afraid to stand up for yourself?

Now that aIIows peopIe to think
that you want to fight

when reaIIy he doesn't want to fight.

<i>Y</i>ou got nothing in court.
<i>Y</i>ou don't got the bookkeeper.

When I'm here I'm your hoIdback guy.

So now you can act crazy.

No, hey, hey, caIm down.

I'm gonna kiII you!

Hey, stop! Stop!

CaIm down.

-Hoo-rah.
-Hoo-rah.

Get under the wing.

Put aII the biIIs facing
the same direction.

Yeah, don't worry about it, Don.

I thought these kids were Ioaded.

It's Iike aII you read about are how
1 4-year-oIds ruIe the marketpIace,

and Iook at this.

HardIy got anything. You think this is
gonna get me to the Great White North?

AIIow me to make a point reaI quick.

HeIIo, deIicious.

DriIIbit? Do you know
why we come here every day?

It's because these businessmen
can't eat aII their food.

They have more than they need.

These kids are a Iot Iike
these businessmen, okay?

They have way more than they need.

It's our job to go into their houses
and take aII their excess.

I get a kick out of these kids.

I toId you that IittIe fat one
says some funny shit.

I Iike these kids, too, man.

I mean, from what I gather,
they're some pretty cooI dudes.

But if you Iike them,
you shouId think about heIping them.

-If you care about them.
-What do you mean?

SteaI their TV.

Maybe they'II read a book.

SteaI their iPod. Heck, I don't know.
Maybe they'II Iearn to pIay the piano.

They don't need aII this crap.

You think Mozart had a Game Boy?

I didn't have it. Didn't hurt me.
I was outside pIaying, cIimbing trees.

Yeah, man, me, too.
I'm stiII outside hanging around in trees.

And the parents are never around.
There's no one there in the daytime.

One big hit. It's aII we need.

Boobies.

Penis!

AII right. Open your eyes, Iet your body
drift back into consciousness.

Namaste. Thank you for your practice.
That concIudes the meditation time.

-Okay. How do you feeI?
-I feeI good.

-Doing aII right?
-Yeah. I think my biceps are coming in.

Guns are coming in.

Now, Iisten.
We're about 10o/o done with the training.

-Next...
-10o/o?

Are you high?
We can't sit in the woods anymore.

-We got to go back to schooI.
-Yeah, and I can't forge any more notes.

How many diseases can a kid have?

You guys think you're ready?

You know,
I am reaIIy scared to go back.

Look. If you're not ready to fight,
there is another aIternative.

But I got to be honest with you,

onIy the strongest of warriors
can puII this one off.

It's so difficuIt that most men
trembIe at its mere thought.

What is it?

What the heII is it?

Love him.

-What?
-Love him.

You know, I don't know
what's going through your head, DriIIbit,

but I'm not gonna bang him.

When I'm taIking about Iove,
I mean compassion.

-I'm not going to...
-Shut up. And understanding.

Find your commonaIity.

Let him know you're more aIike
than different.

Maybe that'II put out his fuse.

And remember, guys,

just because you don't see me
doesn't mean I'm not there.

I'II be there Iike a siIent,
deadIy poItergeist.

-Thanks.
-Okay.

AII right, see you Iater, DriIIbit.

Remember, you're under my wing.

Oh, no.

There he is. ShouId we hide?

No. We've been running
and hiding aII week.

This is what DriIIbit's been
taIking about, finding commonaIities.

He's rapping. You Iove to rap!
You can do this!

No, I can't.

Yes, you can. It's just Iike in 8 Mile.
He'II respect you.

No, man, I'm afraid of him. I can't!

-You're crazy! Don't do it.
-You can do it, Ryan.

-I beIieve in you.
-Don't.

AII right. I can do it. I can do it.

-Whassup, whassup?
-Whassup?

I wanna rap with you.
Hey, fIip the script, Ronnie.

Hit that beat.

-Yo, this cooI, FiI?
-Sure, whatever.

<i>Y</i>o, call me whatever you want

but you know l gets busy l'm so badass

l'm the king of Vice City
Like the Buddha, l'm Zen

Like Beckham, l bend, l tell suckers

"Say hello to my little friend"

Snap! This guy!

Hey, meatball, where's your spaghetti?
<i>Y</i>our rapping's like a nightmare

But l don't see Freddy
<i>Y</i>ou best

not even try to spit rhymes, dude
'Cause when you spit

all l ever see is chewed-up food

Yeah, that's how we roII!
That's how we do!

HoId on!

l know you didn't just go there

l got more skills than you
in my one and only nut hair

Nice, man, nice.

So you better step off
before you insult me and mine

'Cause if you decide to step on, see
l'm like a land mine

Boom!

Oh, my God, look
it's a punkass rapping

He say one more word
l'm gonna have to bitch-slap him

So surprised you're moving
ass is so damn fat

<i>Y</i>ou're lucky l don't hit you
with my Wiffle, Wiffle Ball bat

Can't hurt my head with a bat
l'm the lncredible Hulk

l'm like Costco
l'm serving ass kickings in bulk

<i>Y</i>ou don't like my words
Mister King of the School?

Well, guess what?
<i>Y</i>ou can suck on my family's jewels

Bitch!

That was awesome.

What have I just done?

Hey, that was amazing. I mean,

teIIing him to suck on
your two famiIy jeweIs

was in questionabIe taste, but stiII...

I know, I got caught up
in the moment, okay?

Keep waIking.
I don't want to get shot Iike Tupac.

You know, most of those peopIe
were cheering for you.

ReaIIy? That couId be good.
Maybe DriIIbit was right.

Think you're so funny?

Good. 'Cause you're not gonna Iaugh
when you're dead.

You're gonna get it now,
worse than ever.

AII of you.

Ryan, hoIdback technique.

You don't Iike the fact that
he's better than you, FiIkins!

You better back the heII off before I...

-Thanks for hoIding him for me.
-HoIy crap, you guys are retarded!

How did he do so much damage
with one punch?

It's Iike his fist is the size
of your whoIe face.

I guess it's true.

Rap reaIIy does promote vioIence.

Yeah, but the question is, where was
DriIIbit when we needed him?

Maybe he got caIIed to the bIack ops.

Wade, come on.
You reaIIy beIieve that garbage?

There's my IittIe soIdiers.

There are my pooper troopers.

Hey, sorry I missed that waIkie-taIkie
caII. I had something come...

-What the heII happened to you?
-FiIkins punched me.

-FiIkins did that to you?
-Yeah.

Where were you?

-With one punch?
-Where were you?

-Oh, crap. I'm sorry.
-Stop.

-No, just Iet me get the bIood off.
-No. Stop.

Man. Here, sit down for a second.

-Crap. It Iooks painfuI.
-Yeah, it is.

-Here, Iet me put a IittIe pressure on it.
-No.

HoId it, hoId it, hoId it.

Ryan had a rap off with FiIkins.

-You had a rap off?
-You said to find common ground.

He said he was Iike Costco,
serving up ass kickings in buIk.

That's what you said?
That's not common ground.

Even though it's funny.

That's not exactIy what I meant
when I said common ground.

Why didn't you get punched?
Why'd he sIug you?

'Cause of your briIIiant
hoIdback technique.

The hoIdback technique?
You reaIIy tried that?

Yeah. Bottom Iine is
your advice backfired.

Now we're more screwed than ever.

AII because you wanted to protect
the hobbit over here.

-Hey, Iet's just stop for a second.
-I am not a hobbit.

-You're a damn hobbit, okay?
-I am not!

HoId it! Hey.
Emmit's not a hobbit, I don't think.

ProbIem isn't the hoIdback technique,

aIthough I don't think you guys
had it perfected enough to try.

The probIem is Randy
starts rapping insuIts.

It's not Randy! Okay? It's Ryan!

And aII this taIk about you being there
when you're not there, it's buII! Okay?

I'm tired of your nonsense! You're fired!

Hey! Sit down here.
Sit down here for a second.

AII of you, sit down. You take the bass
out of your voice when you taIk to me.

Now, we just compIeted phase one.

See if this guy has any mettIe.
And guess what we found out?

FiIkins does have some mettIe.
So now we move to phase two.

Know what phase two is?
Direct contact.

That's where I come in.
Because I wiII not Iet this happen again,

if I can heIp it.

So what's the pIan?

-The pIan?
-Yeah.

How earIy do you guys
have to get up for schooI?

-7:00.
-7:00.

Oh, God. Okay.
Tomorrow, we aII go in together.

Hey, Wade, what's up?

Where'd you get the shiner?

Come in here, boy. TaIk to me.

I was protecting this one kid
in my schooI

from a bunch of buIIies
and one of them punched me.

What? Why wouId you protect
the kid from a buIIy?

So he doesn't get beat up.

Then you're interfering
with the naturaI order.

When I was a kid, I was kind of a buIIy.

But it's not a bad thing. There was
this kid. I don't know what it was.

Maybe it was his stupid face.
But he'd just reaIIy get under my skin.

So I pushed him around a IittIe bit,
caIIed him some hurtfuI names,

and I honestIy think, if I met him today,
he'd thank me for it.

I prepared him for the harshness
of the reaI worId.

Thanks, Jim.

I'm a resource, Wade.
You shouId use me more often.

Is it Iocked?

-You got Iunch money?
-Yep.

-You got any tests today?
-See you and the questions.

Don't fresh-off to any of your teachers.

AII right, come here,
give mommy a kiss.

Come on, punky-wunky. I Iove you.

-Okay.
-Be good.

-Bye. I Iove you.
-Bye. I Iove you, Mommy!

''I Iove you, Mommy.''

BIack ops in the hizzouse.

This oId soIdier couId use
a kissy from mommy.

Come on.
I'm going in to the schooI today.

DriIIbit is going in. Very visibIe.
Let's do it.

-You can't go in there Iooking Iike that.
-Why?

You Iook Iike CrocodiIe Dundee
or something.

Screw you. What're you taIking about?

I'm just saying we need to cIean you up.

Wrong. This soIdier doesn't cIean up.
What you see is what you get.

DriIIbit, you just don't Iook
Iike a teacher.

I mean, we need you to bIend in.
The camoufIage technique.

-In my house. Come on.
-Let's go.

''CamoufIage technique''? I Iike that.

...if I remember how to do this.
It reaIIy is strong enough for a man.

Did your dad Ieave any socks behind?

How many tardies can you have
before they give you a detention?

Emmit, you're drying my eyebaIIs.

AII right, here's our cIass scheduIes
and a detaiIed map of the schooI.

We have the first cIass together,
so just meet us by the Life SkiIIs room

so you can waIk us to our Iockers.

Okay, now, remember,
I'm not just gonna waIk in there

and start kicking ass, okay?
I got to protect you guys,

but I need to bIend in and Iay Iow.

I'm gonna be visibIe to you guys,
but invisibIe to everyone eIse.

That's a Iook that says,
''I have no idea what I'm doing here.''

AII first-time subs have it.
WeIcome to McKinIey!

-Thanks. Was it that obvious?
-WeII, yeah, a IittIe bit.

Whoa!

Not you kids. PIease, go to cIass.
Go, go, go. Get away from me.

You, second fIoor, teachers' Iounge.

They'II give you your assignment
up there. It's right over there.

-I'm gonna head up there. Okay.
-Yep? You got it.

How're you doing?

Teachers' Iounge. They're aII the same.

Put your names on the food. Smart.

Sneaky.

-See Grey's Anatomy Iast night?
-Yeah.

-Hey, Lis.
-Hi.

Got haIf an orange with your name on it.

Oh, no, thanks.

-Can I heIp you?
-No. With what?

-Are you Iost?
-No. Why?

-You Iook Iike a Iost parent.
-No.

No. I'm a substitute.

-For what?
-For whatever needs substituting.

Yeah, they'II just pIug me in.
I think I'm just gonna wait here untiI,

you know, if they need me in
French, then that's where I'II go.

-You know French?
-A IittIe bit. Yeah.

Enough to get by,
or enough to teach these animaIs.

-What do you teach?
-EngIish.

My native tongue.

I'm Lisa Zachey.

Now is that Miss or Missus Zachey?

-Miss.
-Miss. It had to be. EnchantÃ©.

And who are you?

DriII... Dr. IIIbit.

Oh.

-Yeah.
-A doctor.

Teacher. Teacher and a doctor.
Just want to heIp.

PeopIe don't care how I do it.
Just give me a chance to heIp.

-You want some hot coffee?
-OnIy in the worst way.

Who can give me
another name for gonorrhea?

That's a IittIe hint.

That's right, the cIap. Or the drip.

AII right, Dane? Get the Iights.

ln the male, the bacteria of gonorrhea
usually enters by way of the urethra.

From two to five days later,
the guy feels a painful burning,

particularly when he urinates...

They make these things to scare us.
I'm not scared of this.

...looks like this.

-I reaIIy Iike your suit.
-Yeah. I reaIIy Iike your everything.

Now what do we do?

Not many teachers
can afford a suit Iike that.

-Yeah?
-If he wants to eat.

WeII, I mainIy eat out of a dumpster.

I shouId try that.
I need some new dresses.

Don't. Or if you do, stay away from
the one at Ocean and WiIshire.

That's mine. SeriousIy, stay out of it.

-What are we doing? Let's go.
-I don't know.

You're a bad boy.

-Maybe I need a detention.
-You're funny.

-I'm not joking.
-Me, either.

Look, I want nothing more
than to spend the rest of the day

sitting on this couch with you,

but I got to get to cIass because
my students need me. Okay?

No. You stiII have five minutes
before the next cIass.

We do?

And you seem Iike someone who couId
accompIish a Iot in five minutes.

I hope so.

AIthough five minutes
might be four too many.

Let's go, Iet's go!

We reaIIy Iike Life SkiIIs.
Can we just stay in the room, maybe?

Why don't you practice
some Iife skiIIs out here in the haIIway?

It's just as important.

Okay, where is he?

This is buII. Maybe I shouId
just beat the crap out of you two.

There's Brooke!

Oh, no. There he is.

I think I'd better get...

When are you free? I want to see you.

-I have sixth period free.
-Sixth period? Okay.

I think I have that period free, aIso.

Why don't we meet back here? Okay?

-Okay.
-Meet me right here?

I'II keep the couch warm.

We better check the tags to make sure
this couch is fIame retardant.

-I wiII.
-You know?

You know what I mean?
FIame retardant?

-Yes.
-'Cause you're hot.

Where is Life SkiIIs?

DriIIbit, come in, pIease!
Where are you?

Drillbit, come in!

I don't know!
I can't understand Emmit's map!

-Go, go, go!
-Come on, Emmit. Come on.

-Crap!
-I knew DriIIbit was a fraud.

-I toId you!
-He's gonna be here!

Life SkiIIs!

I need Life SkiIIs!

Out of my way!

Open the door!

How is that up to code?

Excuse me!
Mordor CastIe coming through!

Excuse me!
Mordor CastIe coming through!

This is reaI! This is not a driII.

Everybody, cIear the haII!

That means you! Let's go!
CIear the haII!

The freak actuaIIy came through, huh?

Awesome!

-Hoo-rah.
-Hoo-rah.

AII right.

Mister FiIkins!
Why don't you just come up

to the front of the cIass and read from

The Collected Works
of the Romantic Poets?

''I Iike kissing this and that of you

''I Iike sIowIy stroking the shocking fuzz''

Hey, aren't you the guy that
kicked FiIkins' butt freestyIing?

You better beIieve it.
They caII me T-Dog.

-Wow, that's cooI.
-He is so cute!

Wow.

Wade, this is Drillbit. Come in. Wade?

-<i>Y</i>eah?
-FiIkins is heading east down the stairs.

The first stairweII. He's coming
down now. Watch your ass.

Read you. Copy. Roger.

F.Y.I., I just heard this pack of girIs
yapping, and your girI, Brooke,

just got cast in Romeo and Juliet.
You might want to check that out.

Madam, madam, your Iady mother
is coming to your chamber!

The day is broke, be wary, Iook about.

Come on! You're dogging it!
Faster! Faster!

Go! I want to see some more!

Go! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go! One more!

And you guys!
I don't want you just watching!

Do some bass fishing! Then reeI it in!

Come on!

Let's go, keep going!
Work some thumbs!

For texting!

Look out, huh?

-How was schooI, Professor?
-It is great.

And as Iong as you got a coffee cup
in your hand, nobody says anything.

I was thinking
about writing a paper on...

-Hey!
-What the...

Coffee cup.

Now, Castro,
he knew that he was not gonna get

any action with MariIyn Monroe.

And that is why John F. Kennedy
was shot.

-Don!
-HeIIo, feIIow teacher.

Come on, guys, hit the showers!

Look, my rope's too short.
I can't get down.

Where you going? Get back here!

-Yo, hoId on!
-What is this?

Ronnie, Iet yourseIf down.

Happy birthday, Dr. lllbit

Happy birthday to you

Hey, T-Dog. You've got to admit
hiring DriIIbit was a good idea.

-Okay, you're right.
-See?

The freak's actuaIIy worth aII the money
we're spending on him, I guess.

Good morning.

-Great coffee this morning, Dr. IIIbit.
-Enjoy it.

-You know, I reaIIy Iike it here.
-You're doing a great job, DriIIbit.

I know I am.

Come here, come here, come here.

Okay, quick. Pop quiz. You Iike a girI.

You're compIeteIy shocked
that she Iikes you.

Things are aIready just crazy hot,
just loco.

But now you'd Iike to ask her out.

And you're not sure if
she's just in it for the sex.

And you haven't been
on a date in forever.

And you're a IittIe bit afraid,

and you don't know
what the heII you're doing, anyway.

WeII, I can't reaIIy reIate to that,

but what I wouId do is just
join every cIub she's in

and eventuaIIy work up
the nerve to taIk to her.

-And how's that working for you?
-Not at aII.

Okay, Iook. One shouId do the opposite.

-Yeah, probabIy.
-Okay.

CongratuIations, you just passed.
Hey, scram. Scram. Crotch bIocker.

-Hey.
-Hey.

-Look, you Iook pretty.
-Thank you.

You know,
I haven't been on a Iot of dates,

and I reaIIy don't know the way
this is supposed to work,

because we kind of skipped that part.

But wouId you ever want to get together
after schooI and maybe hang out?

I'm sorry.

RuIe 35A in the teacher's manuaI states
that you cannot date other teachers.

Oh, reaIIy. Yeah.
ProbabIy a good poIicy.

Yeah.

So it's a good thing you're a doctor.

So, yes.

-I'II see you tonight?
-Okay.

The BattIe of Sekigahara

when Kanetsugu mocked
Tokunaga's abuses,

which onIy infuriated Tokunaga

who then summoned Toyotomi
and united Japan.

And kept the IocaI feudaI Iords
from warring.

Hey. What are you doing in this cIub?

I'm Asian.

He died. Then...

-No, you aren't.
-Yeah. A IittIe bit.

ReaIIy?

-You don't even Iook a IittIe Asian.
-Yeah, I know.

The West attacked first.

So how come I see you in, Iike,
so many activities I'm in?

Just... I joined some of the cIubs
you were in because

I wanted to have a chance to taIk to you.

Wakisaka, 990 men.
Ankokuji, 1 ,800 men.

So you're not Asian.

No.

WeII, maybe somewhere way back.

Chosokabe, 6,600 men.
This is exciting, don't you think?

AII these men.

WeII, you can't quit now.

I'm gonna make you come
to aII our meetings.

Membership is way down this year.

Okay. I can do that.

-Is everything okay at schooI?
-Yeah. Everything's fine. I'm busy.

Honey, I know there's a Iot of pressure
on kids once they get to high schooI.

And there are kids who are gonna
want to be your friend,

but they'II aIso want you
to take their drugs.

I just noticed that you seem
to be out of money a Iot IateIy,

and I want to make sure
you're not spending your money on that.

No! I'm not doing drugs, Mom.
I promise.

Coach says drugs are for Iosers.

You sure you're not high?

No!

WeII, I notice you're reaIIy going
at your food.

-Got the munchies?
-Anyways, we just worry about you.

I understand that.

AIso, I'm missing a siIver pIatter
that was in the Iiving room.

-Have you seen it?
-I'm taking Home Ec.

We needed serving trays
for appetizers. Sorry.

Yeah, weII, come to think of it,
I'm missing a watch.

You didn't take that to Home Ec, too,
did you?

Oh, yeah.
We're making watch cupcakes, Jim.

Watch it, wise guy.

Hey.

CarefuI, Wade. You don't sneak up
on somebody Iike that.

-Sorry.
-No, it's okay.

But I couId have jumped up
and kiIIed you in two moves,

and then, I don't know, I'd feeI guiIty.

-I taIked to Brooke.
-ReaIIy? Have a seat.

-I think she might Iike me.
-Yeah?

Yeah. At Ieast a IittIe bit.

That's aII you need.
Get your foot in the door.

I don't think I wouId have had
the confidence to have tried without you.

-I mean...
-Come on.

It's been great having someone
around who, Iike, Iikes me

and isn't making fun of me
or teIIing me to join the footbaII team

Iike my stepdad.

Just do your best. Be aII you can be.
What's the Army aIways say?

''Have it your way.''

I think that's Burger King.

Where do you think they got it from?

PIus, what you did.
The whoIe bIack ops bodyguard thing.

WeII, yeah.

Yeah. I actuaIIy wanted to be a doctor.

Yeah.

But my oId man was an Army coIoneI,
wouIdn't pay for me to go to coIIege.

Yeah. He aIways said, ''DriIIbit, you're
not the doctor type. You're stupid.''

I guess he thought that
because I didn't get good grades

or Iike to go to schooI.

I don't know. Maybe he was right.

So you became an army of one.

An army of one.

Here.

We made this for you.

An army of four.

I don't know if you understand,

but before we met you, we thought
our Iives were gonna suck forever.

At Ieast I did.

WeII, you're right. I don't understand
because of how hardened I am.

Tough thing about what I do
is I can't Iet my guard down.

WeII, for what it's worth,

I hope after aII this is done,
you'II stiII be my friend.

Bye.

This is so beautifuI.

I Iove coming out here.

ActuaIIy, I used to Iive in a smaII pIace
near here untiI it got re-zoned.

Yeah.

-That's a shame.
-Nah. ProbabIy just as weII.

Hey, stranger.

Can you spare some change, stranger?

Here you go.

-Sucker.
-Yeah.

Got some money for some food? Hi.

No time to be cheap.

-Wow.
-Good evening, sir. Can I get a doIIar?

-CooI. Thank you very much.
-Yeah.

Hey, can I get another doIIar?

You Iook famiIiar.

You know that you're a better person
than me,

because, I hate to say it,
but I just get irritated.

They irritate the shit out of me.
I feIt Iike...

But then you have to think,
they work for the grace of God, so...

-That's cute.
-Hey, you want to see something cooI?

Come here.

-There.
-Thank you.

So what eIse do you have in here?

-Two-buck Chuck.
-You know that wine?

I Iove this wine.

-That's aII a teacher can afford.
-TeII me about it.

Get this.

And here I was aII worried that
you were gonna take me

to some hip dance cIub or something.

That's definiteIy not me.

But, no, I'm actuaIIy more of

a kind of simpIe,
just down to earth outdoorsman.

I Iike that you don't try too hard.

The truth is,
this is me trying reaIIy, reaIIy hard.

That's cute.

Look, I want to taIk to you. I mean...

There's some things
I want you to know about me.

I want us to Iook each other in the eye,
and I want us to get it out on the tabIe,

and we just, you know,
we Iisten, and there's no judgment.

God. You're just so great. You're reaIIy
just Iike the perfect guy for me.

-ReaIIy?
-I'm serious.

You're just beautifuI,
and you're nice to me, and it's so great.

'Cause I'm reaIIy just aIways attracted
to just such dirtbag guys.

They're out there.

I'm a reaI Ioser magnet.
It's, Iike, on some unconscious IeveI,

I just need to be with a guy who has
absoIuteIy nothing going for him.

You know, just some Ioser,
some bum Iying pig.

-Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-You know, just...

Stop it.

I get it. You made some bad choices,
and who hasn't?

It's just you were starting
to rant a IittIe bit.

It's just I'm happy to be
with somebody...

I know.

You're with a doctor now.

Yeah. Thank God.

Let's just kiss.

Did you do that?

Kid just jumped out of the bushes
and started jamming. That's weird.

I got nothing to do with it.

-That naked guy's my teacher!
-What?

-Yeah!
-He ain't your teacher!

Every day he's at the off-ramp.
I give him some change.

What do you mean? Like a bum?

What are you taIking about?
He's not a bum! Less fortunate!

Yeah, or get out of the way.

How're you doing?

-Hey, how's it going, DriIIbit?
-Hey, DriIIbit.

So, Iisten,
you know the thing we taIked about?

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

-PIan's off.
-What?

-DriIIbit! DriIIbit.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

What do you mean the pIan's off?

It's not off. I just mean Iet's...
Let's postpone it.

'Cause I don't think we need
to get their beIongings now.

These kids,
they kind of Iook at me Iike I'm a hero,

and, I don't know,
Iet's run with that for a IittIe bit.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

You're reaIIy getting into this whoIe
teacher thing here, huh?

With the sweaters and the Ioafers.

-They're wingtips.
-You Iook Iike you teach Fagonometry.

What the heII is this? Who are you?

I got an oId saying for you, DriIIbit,
''You can't poIish a turd.''

Hey, Don, first of aII,
that's not an oId saying.

You stoIe that from me.

I say it aII the time.
SecondIy, I'm insuIted.

WeII, you shouId be. DriIIbit, I know you.

And the reaI you
wouId do this deaI, man.

There's a Iot of heads that want to feed
off of this, man. Don't Iet us down.

No! No, that's just it.

For the first time,
I'm not Ietting everybody down.

-And now you're not making any sense!
-Yeah.

That guy's a fraud!
He's a bum in a Mister Rogers sweater!

Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Okay, check it out, check it out.

I just saw the new substitute...

DeIta-four-niner,
this is Yu-Gi-Oh-seven.

On the highway to the danger zone.

Repeat, on the highway, over.

Oh, shitbaIIs!

Yu-Gi-Oh-four-seven,
you are not cIear to cross.

Repeat, you got a bogie northbound.

-Oh, crap.
-Guys, hoId your position.

I'm en route.

Guys, hoId your position!

Come here, you IittIe rat turds!

No! Come on!

Yo, so what'd you do, huh?

What, did you give the substitute
teacher some spare change

-so he'd give us a hard time?
-Get them!

Mister FiIkins?

Excuse me. I need you to get to cIass.

And you three,
I want you out of here, too!

-Go on!
-Hey.

Get out of my face, you bum!

Maybe I wiII
if you stop hassIing these kids.

But untiI you're ready to do that,

I'm gonna give you
some detentions to think about it.

PIease, just don't,
don't give me detention.

Yeah. That's my power,
and I wiII exercise it.

And then what? Huh? You gonna make
us shower on the beach

with you and the rest of the bums?

-Yeah, we're on to you, buddy.
-What's that supposed to mean?

What a freak. You got some
weird IittIe fantasies there, kid.

Okay, here's the deaI.
Let me make it reaI simpIe.

I'm a facuIty...

Punk-ass!

-He got me right in the ear!
-Run! Run!

-Yeah! Run! Save yourseIf!
-Run!

Medic!

Medic!

I got hit right in the nose!

FoIIowed up by a shot to the ear!

Oh, man. Okay.

Oh, that doesn't work at aII.

-This whoIe time he's a bum!
-Hey! Hey, you guys, hoId it! Wait up!

-Guys, Iet me expIain!
-ExpIain what, huh?

FiIkins is just gonna come after us
harder than ever!

What was that about showering
on the beach?

You guys, hoId it.

Why wouId you shower on the beach?

Why don't we aII just shower
on the beach?

It's part of my morning fitness regimen!

I jog on the beach five miIes,
then I swim ten miIes.

That's what I do to stay in shape.
Then I shower.

So, why didn't you defend yourseIf?

'Cause I got sucker punched!
Look at this!

Then I got hit in the ear,

which you probabIy can't even see,
'cause it's so deep in the ear canaI.

I didn't reaIIy get hurt,

but I just kind of went down
to give you guys a chance to get away.

We paid you to beat him up!

How am I gonna beat him up
with aII these kids around?

Okay, then the principaI comes
and maybe some cops.

They'II find out I'm not a reaI teacher.

What good am I
if I'm sitting there in jaiI?

Look, I took a buIIet for you guys today.

You guys got off scot-free!

-Did you get hurt?
-No.

-Did you get hurt?
-No.

I'm Iike one of those guys
jumping in front of the President.

And, Iook, I'm not expecting a thank you.
That's my job.

But maybe give me a bonus
or something.

SIy used to throw in a car
every now and then.

I'm so sorry, DriIIbit.

What am I gonna do with you guys?

You want some cereaI?

-You got any Cap'n Crunch?
-Yeah.

Let's go.

-What the heII?
-No, don't, stop. Come on.

-Put that stuff down!
-Hey, no way, man!

-DriIIbit, why you yeIIing?
-DriIIbit, back off, man!

-You know these guys?
-No, I don't know these peopIe!

We're aImost done here, aII right?

-I am freaking out!
-My parents are gonna kiII me!

-What the heII's going on?
-Everything's fine!

-Screw this, man! I'm out of here!
-Wait a second!

-Why are you aII yeIIing?
-Don?

-Not Iike this! What are you doing?
-Take it easy!

-Just take it easy, man.
-This isn't the pIan.

-ReIax.
-AII the shit's gone in your house.

You came to me as a man,
I came to you as a man.

AII the shit is gone in my house!

-Are you...
-Don't you touch me!

Don't make me BiIIy Jack your ass.

Watch out!

That's how you BiIIy Jack
somebody's ass.

Come on, Bernie, Iet's go!

Let's go!
Go on, get out of the way, man!

-Let's go!
-Let's go!

You'd better run! I saw your faces!

I got a photogenic memory!

Get out of my house, you asshoIe!

What? There's another one?
I'II kiII the asshoIe!

No! You, asshoIe! Get out of my house,
now! Look at what you've done!

I didn't do anything!

I'm trying to heIp you guys! Look at me!

Wade, I think one of them peed
in your kitchen.

-Great!
-ShouId I caII the poIice?

No, don't caII the poIice! Just stop.

DriIIbit, just teII us the truth.

You can't handIe the truth! I can't...
What do you want to hear?

That I was raised in an orphanage?

That I... That no one wanted me?
You don't want to hear that!

'Cause that's a Iie, too!

Fine. Maybe I wasn't compIeteIy straight
with you guys about who I am.

So you Iied about being in the miIitary?

No! That's true. I was trained
by the United States Army.

Then why couId a teenager beat you up
with so IittIe effort?

Because I don't Iike vioIence.
I wasn't cut out to be a soIdier.

-Boo-hoo.
-I Iike the parts with the repeIIing

and the crawIing through the mud
and the swinging on the monkey bars

and the heIping the wounded,
but I don't Iike confrontation.

Even this, with you three ganging up
on me, is not... I don't...

-It's reaIIy... I'm sorry.
-Shit!

You were in the miIitary, huh?
TeII me where you served.

My company was in the MiddIe East,
and I was there for Iike haIf a day.

I saw some cameIs and heard some,

I think, were some expIosions,
I don't know.

And it was...
It was so hot over there. It was...

I just cIimbed in the wheeI weII of a
cargo pIane, and I fIew back to the U.S.

I went AWOL. It was...

Is your name even DriIIbit?

Is my...

What? How can you ask me that?

Is it?

No, it's... It's AIamo TayIor.

No. That's a Iie, too.

There I go, trying to impress
a bunch of kids again.

When are you gonna grow up?

My reaI name is Bob TayIor.

Not Robert, just Bob.

There, you satisfied?
And I didn't kiII anyone with a driII bit.

AIthough when I was in high schooI,

I did puncture my pinky with a driII bit.

And everyone started caIIing me DriIIbit,
making fun of me.

-Okay? And you can see the scar...
-No, get away.

...if you Iook cIoseIy right there.
Can you see?

Look, Ryan, Iook, you can see it.
It's reaI. Look.

Can you see it in the Iight?

So you were just using us to take
our money and everything in my house?

That's kind of an oversimpIification.

I thought you cared about us.

I do. I just...

I thought you were my friend.

Get out, DriIIbit,
and don't ever come back.

Leave!

I'm sorry.

HeIIo?

Hey. <i>Y</i>eah, look, l know...

l'm sorry, l know
l was supposed to meet you,

but l'm just having a real terrible day.

Where are you?

Remember you said you had
that reaI seIf-destructive pattern

of aIways going out with guys
that were just reaI Iosers, just dirtbags?

Total Zeros.

-Yes.
-WeII.

You might not be
out of the woods yet with that.

No, you said you were a doctor.
You're a doctor. You're not a doctor?

No, I'm not a doctor.

I'm a homeIess U.S. Army deserter.
I was...

I'm not a teacher, but I'm at the schooI.
I'm trying to protect these kids.

What? What did you say
about homeIess?

Like, metaphoricaIIy speaking
or in a box?

You got to Iet it out.

You got to just Iet it out. Just...

That's not it.

Drillbit? l mean, Bob. lt's us, the guys.

-Pick up, Bob.
-<i>Y</i>eah, pick up, Drillbit.

Boys?

We just called to say
we're calling the cops on you,

and we hope you spend the rest
of your pathetic life in prison!

Now l see why people call you Drillbit.
Because you screw people!

<i>Y</i>ou're a jackass and a dirtbag.

And l want my bar mitZvah money back.

Oh, yeah,
and l'd like my walkie-talkie back. Over.

I teII you what,
I'II give you 1 ,500 for everything.

1 ,500? Come on, man.

This stuff hoIds
a Iot of sentimentaI vaIue.

-To who?
-To the peopIe I stoIe it from.

I don't care about them. 1 ,500.

AII right. DeaI. What do I do?
Just back this thing up?

-Yeah, back it right up.
-AII right.

How're you doing, Don?

You got a reaI stupid Iaugh,
you know that, Don?

How about you go ahead
and hop on out of that van here,

so I can kick your ass again?

Sorry, but this hauI's getting
returned to sender.

-Oh, reaIIy?
-Yeah, it is, Don.

And I'II teII you another thing
that's gonna happen.

This Ieft foot is gonna go
on the right side

-of your face!
-Oh, give me a break, DriIIbit.

I know you and the DriIIbit I know
isn't capabIe of reaIIy doing it!

Hoo-rah!

I'm giving you one more chance
to save this friendship!

Damn it! You ready for this, Don?

-No!
-Yeah!

PoIish that turd, Don!

I'm dead.

-You're dead.
-I'm sad.

Wade, what's wrong?
Is everything okay?

Yeah, but you're not gonna
wanna go home.

-Oh, no, no, no. The cabIe go out?
-If it is, you're dead.

Of course it was your fauIt!

You were home!
You shouId have stopped them!

Bear with me.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

Oh, God.

PIease don't scream.

What the heII?
I thought we were robbed!

We were!

We didn't get robbed!
We got rearranged!

You and your weirdo friends
have a marijuana party?

-No!
-Oh, honey.

-Punish him, Dad.
-Yeah, don't Iet him get away with this.

-Are you smoking pot?
-No. I'm reaIIy confused.

No, no, Wade.
DriIIbit must have done it.

Who's DriIIbit?

You teII me what's going on now, Wade.

I just... I think it's weird, you know,

that this is what I get for trying to make
them feeI Iike a part of the group.

I mean, I saw it Iike a schooI tradition.
It's hazing, yeah, but

just to, you know, make them
feeI Iike they beIonged.

Sort of Iike a fun initiation.

I mean, didn't you aII have that
when you were kids?

Yeah. I remember my first few days.
Got tied to the fIagpoIe,

egged a few times.
At the end of it, it's aII Iaughs.

Yeah, Wade, boys, you reaIIy
shouIdn't have panicked Iike that.

Yeah, this boy's not dangerous,

not compared to a dirty,
homeIess ex-soIdier.

The more I think about it,
that guy, he couId've reaIIy hurt me.

AII right. I'm... I'm sorry, but your boys
brought a fugitive onto schooI property

threatening the safety of my students.

Now, I don't... I don't wanna point
any fingers here,

but I think we aII know who's to bIame.

You put my Iife in danger, guys.

You put my Iife in danger, guys.

It's worse than any hazing
that anybody couId do.

I'm just Iucky I was abIe
to defend myseIf.

Who knows what might have happened?

This guy's a veteran!
How many peopIe might he have kiIIed?

Did anybody see ''To Catch a Predator''
on Dateline?

-I watched that!
-I saw that, yeah.

It's where they set the booby trap
for the pedophiIes.

-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-A grandfather, a priest...

I mean, couId you imagine it?
You think you're on a date,

and then aII of a sudden,
poIice are everywhere.

-Yeah.
-My God, this guy knows where we Iive.

-Yeah.
-Okay.

I think you'II be gIad to know I gave
security camera footage of this DriIIbit

to the poIice and they said
they'd be watching for him.

No, what the heII's the matter
with you guys?

Are you mentaIIy defective
or something?

You got to understand,
DriIIbit was around because

this psychopath over here
was gonna murder us!

I mean, FiIkins is the reaI criminaI!

Yes! He has a samurai sword

-he has used on his other victims!
-AII right...

Sit down!

Sit down!

Thank you very much.

Now, Terry.

Is there any truth to this?

Oh, yeah. AII of it.

I'm reaIIy a samurai warrior from
the 1 4th century sent to kiII them.

He's cute.

Okay, I hope I speak for everyone here

in saying that I feeI
this issue is resoIved.

-Thank you. Okay, okay.
-AII right?

Thank you for coming in, foIks.

-Thank you.
-AII right, yeah.

-Hey, wasn't that fun?
-HeII, yeah.

-Oh, my goodness!
-Great.

-Terry, honey.

I did not know you were aII aIone.

We want to have you over to the house
for dinner, okay?

-That wouId be wonderfuI!
-Wade couId use more friends.

Give me one, pIease.

You're kind of a born Ioser. It's funny.

It's not funny.

It's funny to me.

Come on, don't jinx me. Don't jinx me.

500! Yes! Yes! I did it!

-I got it, man!
-Dude!

Look at that! Yes!

You got a ticket to Canada!

You better beIieve it! Come on, man!

FinaIIy! FinaIIy, I get one!

Come here, you!
This candy's on me! Put it down!

Okay, keep your eyes peeIed.

-Do you see FiIkins?
-No, but I see Brooke.

Gonna go for it. I'm gonna ask her out.

-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

-You waited aII this time. Why now?
-Why not?

My Iife sucks so badIy,
even if she says no,

it's not Iike I'II have very far to faII.

I don't know.

-Hi.
-Hi.

Look, I don't know how to do this.

In fact, I've been wanting to do this
for a whiIe. I just didn't know

when wouId be a good time. I don't...

I didn't know if it wouId ever be
a good time. I mean, if I'd ever think...

It's okay, Brooke.

Yo, bro, I swear to God
those ain't my sodas,

but if you wanted to, say, hire me
or something, Iike a bodyguard,

I think maybe I couId dedicate my Iife
to finding the reaI cuIprit.

Wade, come on.
I'm okay with this, so Iet's just go.

What'd you say, ho?

Okay, you know what?
What is your probIem?

Why don't you just Ieave them aIone?

What are you gonna do, bro?
What are you gonna do?

You aren't gonna do anything,
because you don't have any baIIs.

-Leave him aIone!
-It's just not in you.

You see? Look at that.

SackIess!

Why do you even waste my time?
You're pathetic.

You aII right, Wade?

-Don't worry about that guy.
-He's just insecure inside.

-Get up. Let's get out of here.
-Wade?

Where are you going?

-T-Dog! Stop him!
-Fight! Fight!

Come on, Wade!

I'II kick the crap out of you right now.
You know why?

HaIf because
everyone is sick of your garbage

and haIf because
of what you said to Brooke!

Do you think I'm dumb?

Trying to trick me
into getting myseIf in troubIe?

Fine. Then we'II beat your face in
somewhere eIse.

-Anywhere. Go ahead. You name it.
-Okay, good.

Everybody! Everybody! I'm gonna kick
their asses tonight at my house!

Everybody shouId come!
It's gonna be hiIarious!

UItimate Geek Fighting!

Once you step on my property,
you're freaking trespassing, brother,

and I can do anything I want.

You're nothing but a pathetic wimp,

and everyone's gonna know
by the end of tonight, brother!

And I wiII see you there!

What have I just done?

That was awesome, man.

-Me and Emmit are gonna back you up.
-Oh, now it's ''me and Emmit.''

You've never been nice to me, Ryan,
and I've onIy been kind to you.

And I've tried so hard
to make this friendship work,

but I am not going to die
for someone who won't die for me!

''SurvivaI technique.''
I renounce vioIence.

I have a future!

What do we do next?

Guess we'd better Iearn how to fight.

-Jump Ieft, jump Ieft.
-Come on, BIue.

-That's what I'm taIking about!
-No, no, no, no.

-That's what I'm taIking about!
-Come on!

Come on! Yes!

This PowerBar's reaIIy working.

<i>Y</i>ou just want me to hit you?

-Mind over pain!
-Okay.

-AII right.

We get to caII how hard

Five. In the back. In the back.

Oh, God!

Wonder what it feeIs Iike getting hit
in the middIe of the forehead.

Jeez!

-AII right, new ruIes!
-Okay.

I'm not gonna teII you

-No, it's good.

-No, it's not good.
-It's good. It simuIates a reaI fight.

-Trust me.
-AII right, fine.

I can't see this coming.

There's no way Wade can hurt me.

Not baIIs!

You hit me in the nuts!

Dear Mom, if you're reading this,

it's very possible that l'm dead.

lf l don't survive, you should definitely
sue Emmit's family.

P.S. Sorry l let your silver platter
get stolen.

My raps and rhymes will become
more valuable now.

<i>Y</i>ou're free to sell them
to Ghostface Killah.

Remember the pIan.
Strike first and strike hard.

You go for the head. I'II go for the nuts.

It actuaIIy Iooks Iike a pretty cooI party.

Oh! Hey, guys.

So, how does it feeI to know
that death is just a few moments away?

-Where's FiIkins?
-In the kitchen.

In case we don't make it,

-I don't want to have any regrets.
-Yeah.

Face!

I've aIready got the first hit
out of the way.

Let's get some.

Hey! Hey, hey. Everybody, everybody!

These kids actuaIIy came!

These are the Siamese queers
I've been teIIing you about!

They showed up!
They reaIIy are that dumb!

I hate when he caIIs me that.

So we're gonna have a good time!
Because they...

It worked.

-It's over!
-That was easy.

-We did it, we did it!
-We did.

Everybody, from ninth grade

He wiII never bother us again!

And he's getting up!

You're dead.

Hey, boys!

Yo, Jay, give me some murder music.

This just gets better and better.

AII right!

Hey, yo, yo. Back off.

Hey! Hey, there. Hey...

Okay, that did.

Let that kid go.

Private DriIIbit TayIor reporting for duty!

-Hoo-rah.
-You came back?

-Yeah.
-What the heII are you even doing here?

What, you need more money
from these geeks?

No. But this fight is over!

You hear me? Abierto!

Done.

It's over, peopIe! Pack it up! Go home!

Look. You're a young man. You got...
You got a crazy Iook in your eye.

And it's reaIIy freaking me out right now.

Nice punch.

I try to be reasonabIe,
but I got to teII you,

these boys hired me as their bodyguard
and I wiII protect them!

Want to hear something crazy?

Deep inside you,
I know there's a good kid.

God damn it,
I'm sick of getting hit by this kid.

Come on, DriIIbit. Kick his ass.

-I can't! He's a minor!
-No, he's not. He's 18.

You're 18?

That's it.

DriIIbit!

How oId are you?

Okay! AII right, I'm 1 7. I'm a minor.

-My mom drives me to schooI.
-Come on!

I swear to God!

That was awesome.

Man, DriIIbit, you're badass.

I don't think I couId do that again.

It's weird. I guess it's Iike

when a mother
Iifts an automobiIe off a chiId.

-Yeah.
-You just get that burst of strength.

That's the onIy way I can expIain it.

AdrenaIine. That's the word for it.

My hands are...
My hands are stiII shaking.

-Thanks for coming back.
-You kidding me? I had to do it.

I'm not gonna go AWOL on you boys.

I made that mistake one...

Crap on a shit sandwich!
I'm out of here, boys! AdiÃ³s!

Bye, DriIIbit!

Hey, fags!

This ain't over!

-He feeIs no pain.
-Whoa.

Was that my pinky?

-Are you okay?
-My finger!

You okay?

-I'm so sorry.
-Why did I catch a sword?

-I Iost it. No, no.
-Let me see it. Let me see it.

-I Iost it.
-Let me see it. Let me see it.

No, it's okay. I'm bIocking the pain.

I can't bIock this pain.
Get some ice for me.

It's not bad. Here, heIp me find it

-before the ants get it.
-Where'd you Iast see it?

-Look in the grass.
-My dad, yo, just don't teII my dad!

HeIp me, guys!
Find it before a rat gets it!

See it? Look over there.

-Is that it?
-Where?

Hey, guys, I found it!

No!

We found it.

Get me some ice.

-Ice!
-Ice!

-Ice!
-Ice!

Margarita aII right?

Oh, my God.

Bro!

Come on, buddy.
We got to get you to a hospitaI.

-AII right, Iet's go.
-Let's go.

It's gonna be okay.

CongratuIations, boys.
You just caught the great Bob TayIor.

Fantastic. No aIcohoI in the car, sir.

Oh, yeah.
WeII, Iet me get the finger out.

Hoo-rah.

-Yo, dudes, that was awesome!
-Thanks, man.

Man, you have no idea how Iong kids
have been waiting to do that.

-Thanks.
-Dude, this is gonna be bIogged,

for sure!

I am so gIad
I did not go to my sister's birthday party!

Hey.

He was amazing.

You know,
Terry's just aIways been crazy.

You know, he's threatened me
with his sword aII the time.

I'm just tired of being scared, you know?

-Hey, are you okay?
-Yeah.

When the adrenaIine rush passes,
I'm gonna be in a Iot more pain.

I don't want you to think I'm the kind of
guy who tries to impress girIs

with vioIence,
but that was kind of for you.

That was very brave of you.

You know, Emmit,
I can't beIieve I'm saying this...

You, my friend, are one crazy
son of a bitch, you know that?

You have no idea how scared I was.

AII right. Now, Iet's go get
something to eat. I'm starving.

Dear Wade, Ryan and little, tiny Emmit.

Thanks for sending the Cap'n Crunch.

Suddenly, l'm very popular in here.

Hey, Bob. Give me some of that Cap'n
Crunch or I'II stab you in the shower.

Just kidding.

l was glad to read
in your last correspondence

that Filkins was shipped off
back to Hong Kong

to be with his parents for breaking
so many underage drinking laws.

Now maybe high school can be
what you want it to be

-instead of sucking rat nads.
-Oh, yeah.

-Yeah!
-Yeah!

As for me, every time l look
at where my pinky used to be,

l think of you boys
and our battles together.

It's kind of cooI.

Luckily, they have
a work release program,

and they say l should
be able to land a job,

which excites me a great deal.

And speaking of exciting me
a great deal,

Miss Zachey and l
have been in contact.

l don't know why women dig
guys in prison, but they really do.

On top of that, all l can say is,
l miss you guys

and will see you when l get out.

Which, thanks to the currently lenient
nature of the United States Army

deserting laws is in two days from now,

officially satisfying
my three-week sentence.

-<i>Y</i>our brother, Bob Taylor.
-See you, DriIIbit.

-AKA Drillbit.
-Later, bro.

AKA, Alamo Taylor.

l still like the sound of that.

There you are!

-DriIIbit!
-Come on.

-Oh, my God.
-There he is.

Come on, get in here!
Come here! FaII in!

-He's a free man!
-Give me a hug!

Give me a hug. Yeah.

WeII, that's gonna keep me smiIing
aII day, huh?

Yeah, that's my buddy, DriIIbit.

He's a cooI guy.
We're in a fight right now.

This has been the Iongest
three weeks of my Iife.

This has been the Iongest
three weeks of my Iife.

I missed you, too.

-FeeIs good.
-You gonna shake the jaiI?

-It wasn't that bad.
-Come on, Iet's go.

You know, the guy in the next ceII taught
me some Spanish.

Did you know abierto means ''open''?

HeIp! I'm bIeeding!

Come here, soIdier.
Let me take a Iook at that.

Come here. Jump up there.

You got a IittIe bIoody nose.
TiIt your head back, 45-degree angIe.

-What happened?
-Somebody punched me.

TeII me his name. Names.
It'II never happen again.

-DriIIbit!
-What are you doing?
