NARRATOR:
During the Civil War, the only
lawmen in Southern Texas--

the Texas Rangers-- disbanded
to fight for the Confederacy.

Ranger Captain LeanderMcNelly
was also the local preacher.

He left his family and ministry
to fight alongside his men.

After the war, McNelly
returned to a defeated Texas

and found his wife
and three sous gone--

taken by bandits.

In the ten years
since the war's end

bandits have overrun
southern Texas.

Now, the governor
is looking for McNelly.

They say he wants to
recommission the Texas Rangers.

( horse whinnies )

Leander...

you know,
that's a right pretty spot

for a resting place.

Who's the grave for?

The grave's for me.

Wait too long

ground'll be froze.

Leander, come spend the winter
at my ranch.

You rode down,
we'd have a place for you.

Be like old times.

I don't reckon
I'll last the winter.

Governor said
he sent some of his men.

you wouldn't show at the door.

Said maybe you'd auswer for me.

The governor
just wants to talk with you.

you don't got to say

yes or no
or it's a cold September.

All you got to do is see him,
Leander.

( stagecoach rattling )

Hyah! Hyah!

And never underestimate
the importance of the name

that you choose for a product.

"The Dunnison and Sous

"Automatic Drawer

for the Tabulation
of Financial Trausactious."

That just about tells the story,
doesn't it?

Every shopkeeper in the country
will want one

( chuckling )
--before they even see it.

Well, that's good, because
the prototype doesn't work.

It's a prototype, son,
it's not supposed to work.

That's why they call it
a prototype.

Look at this.

I've already come np
with a solution

to the prob...

It's for your mother.

Why didn't you mail it
while we were in Austin?

you'll see.

( men hollering and whistling )

( mooing )

Past 4:00, Marshall.

We should get started

before these buyers
get even more nervous.

I got a bad feeling.

you just got to border
country today, Marshall.

you'll get used to it.

Coming down.

There you go.

Lincoln!

Mother? Jake?

Oh, thank goodness.

Oh...

( chuckling )

Look how tall you've gotten.

--Nice hat.
--Little brother.

What? you're going
to be a lawyer?

--I just might.
--How beautiful.

Oh, you still quick?

Come on, boy.

( quiet laugh )

( clanging )

I'd like to thank

all of you for coming here today
for the first

of what we hope

will be many
cattle auctious

here in Las Coli...

King Fisher.

( horse neighs )

( slow hoofbeats )

What's your business here,
Fisher?

Come for my beeves.

This here's an auction.

you're welcome to bid
when the time comes.

I bid 50.

50 what?

50 of them.

( hoofbeats thundering )

( horses neighing )

( horses whinny and burr )

( guus cocking )

FISHER:
Marshall, I don't
think you understand.

around here,
I'm the law.

Now, I'm taking
my beeves home.

I can't let you
take these cattle.

MAN:
All right, all of you,
fan out!

Come on! Come on!

Hyah!

( whistling and shouting )

Come on, let's
get out of here!

( crying quietly )

( iusects chirring )

( bird keening )

( fire crackling )

( bird cawing )

( man groaus )

( floorplanks squeaking )

Is anyone here?

Don't move and I'll shoot!

Don't move and you'll shoot?

What does that mean?

If I don't move,
you're going to shoot me?

Who are you?
What are you doing here?

My name is
Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.

you understand, I'm not
one of the men who did this...

so I'll be on my way.

( whimpering softly )

I can't lift it free.

I can help you.

Put down the gun.

( hammer uncocks )

I'm from Missouri.

We was on a cattle drive

and stopped for supplies,
and we got ambushed.

They stole all the cattle
and killed everybody.

Didn't kill you.

I was trapped...

and they didn't see me

and I'm damn lucky
that was the case

otherwise, I'd
be dead too.

So, where you headed?

Browusville.

Browusville?
What's there?

Texas Rangers
are recruiting.

Texas Rangers?!

I'm going with you.

We'll get them bandits.

It's a long way
to Browusville.

I got a horse.

Name's George Durham.

( coyote howls )

( bird hooting )

Not so used

to sleeping under the stars,
are you?

( howling and barking )

Well...
there's nothing to it, really.

just, uh, dig yourself
a little hip hole

and then you fill a bandanna

full of saw grass

and stick that
underneath your head.

It's the Lord's country,
Lincoln.

Yeah... Lord's country.

Land this beautiful...

ain't no wonder

everybody's
killing over her.

( coyote howling )

She's been here
a long time before us.

She'll be here

a long time to come.

you are a philosopher,
George Durham.

( horses whinnying )

DRIVER:
Hyah!

Brownsville.

MAN:
We're going
to protect

you people,
least you can do

is contribute supplies.

you want a starving army?

Who's going to keep
the crops safe then?

you fellas there

grab all the grub
you can carry.

Get your irons and fall in.

We're riding south
to kill bandits!

( townsfolk murmuring )

Afternoon, Rangers.

What's your business here?

By order of the community

I've got a vigilance committee
formed.

Nary a Yankee, nigger
or Mexican among us.

unless you have
the authority of the state

disband and disarm these men.

They won't have it.

We aim to protect
our land.

Men who want to protect
their land

they can apply to hire from me.

Governor's commissioned
the Rangers

to do the
protecting, mister.

Now, you disband these men.

you from San Antone?

'Cause you
sure as hell

remind me
of this preacher there.

It was some years ago...

some preacher man.

I don't recall no time
in San Antone.

No, I suppose you don't.

Men, you can keep your guns
to guard your homes

but that means
go home.

( crowd murmuring )

I'll give you one minute
to take a vote.

Hey, Preacher...

vote's in.

Preacher...

( gasping )

say me last rites, Preacher

before he takes me.

I ain't no preacher.

Company's making camp,
two nights in Brownsville.

Any of you men interested
in taking on the star?

West end of town's
where you'll find us.

you look for me,
Leander McNelly

or my associates

Sergeant
John Armstrong

or Frank Bones.

( snarling )

DRIVER:
Hyah, hyah!

( wagon squeaking and rattling )

Whoa-whoa. Whoa.

?Habla ingles?

?Mexicano?

The big villas are north, yes?

you asking or telling?

That is what we want.

I thought the cattles,
you drive them north, too.

With many peoples.

With iron trains.

That is what we want.

These beeves
don't speak ingles.

They speak, uh...
espanol.

( chuckling )

What do you want for her?

The tigre is not for sale,
senor.

What about her?

She is my wife, senor.

What's she do?

What's she do?!

She acrobat, senor.

She spins and balances
and juggles.

Well, if she can juggle
three balls in the air

without dropping one of them,
you can keep your tomcat.

( chuckles )

Perdita, andele.

Mas alto.

Mas alto, Perdita.

( screams )

Catch it!

Hyah!

( screams )

( gunshot )

( chuckles )

Name?

Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.

Where you from,
Mr. Dunnison?

From Philadelphia, sir, as a boy

but I spent the last three years
traveling with my father

a salesman and inventor.

Where's he now?

He's dead, sir.

He was shot down by bandits.

Ain't no revenge riding,
Mr. Dunnison.

Yes, sir.

Saddle up.

When Frank here says
draw, you draw.

Takes longer than
a half a second

means you're dead.

That Ranger badge
is your target.

Sarsaparilla.

Most boys draw on sarsaparilla.

Draw, damn it.

The gun doesn't seem
to be loaded, sirs.

Son, you might want
to cock the hammer.

How'd he do?

Nine seconds.

Seen worse.

Gentlemen, you've been gracious
to grant me your time.

I wish you the best
in your endeavors.

Give my best to Philadelphia.

just so there are
no hard feelings either way

I didn't come here
for a mouth's pay

or to execute
some bandits

like they did
my family.

I came here
because you sent out for men

who wanted to protect
their land.

I have no land
but the patch

my own two feet stand on

but I would want that land
to be lawful, sir.

you put that down in writing,
Mr. Dunnison?

Sir?

That high-minded talk.

you write like that, too?

In English, French or Latin?

Well, shit, Mr. Dunnison.

I only know Spanish,
Cherokee and Comanche.

$40 a mouth in a state scrip
and found.

you'll get your pay
from Sergeant Armstrong.

you'll get your orders
from me.

We'll sell you the boots,
sell you a gun

sell you a steed.

but it'll run you $40,
Mr. Dunnison

so you better last a mouth...

'cause you're in debt to me
already.

Here you are.

Thanks.

Wear it proud, son.

Sergeant.

( stnttering ):
Name's Sam from
S-S-San Antone.

I never been
to S-S-San Antone.

Randolph Douglas Scipio

from around
the Texarkana way.

My daddy staked
some land out there.

Turned out to find himself
a copper mine

so they killed my daddy.

you shouldn't be able
to just shoot a man

and claim his land.

Yeah.

Yeah, I aim to
change that.

So, uh, Sergeant say

whether he'll use you as
a rifleman or a scout?

A rifleman or a scout?

Well, every white
boy I met yet

says Sergeant
made him a rifleman.

Every colored, like me

Sergeant made a scout.

Well, every war
I ever heard of

scouts get killed
before the shooters

'cause they're the stupid son
of a bitches sent out front.

And if I don't meet
some white boy scouts soon

President Grant's
going to be hearing from me.

Sure.

A strongly worded letter's
always best.

They say I'm a scout?

you see this star here?

I'm gonna show them
I'm a shooter.

Dunnison.

What do you think, huh?

( snorts )

George!

Lincoln! Lincoln!

Lincoln!

We're Rangers!

We made it!

( laughing )

We're not sleeping
under the stars.

We got a tent.

Oh, it's nice, too.

you got to see it.

( laughing )

It's a tent!

I got my be...
I'm on the left!

BONES:
Fisher's been splitting

his men into several bands.

They've been
raiding ranches

all along this trail
on the way to Mexico.

GnARD:
Captain? Mr. Dunnison's
reporting, sir.

Send him in.

Captain.

Sergeant said
you wanted to see me.

Thanks, Frank.

Take a seat, Mr. Dunnison.

Notebook and pen are yours.

Every word I say,
you write it down.

Something slips by,
slow me down.

Understood, sir.

October 26.

Company now
fully outfitted

with 30 men,
orphans mostly.

youngest 15.

We'll leave tomorrow
and train on the trail.

Fisher split his men
into smaller raiding parties.

Lord hope that we're
not attacked directly.

( McNelly coughing )

Scant trail
experience

weakness with weapons...

Expect desertions along the way.

Expect... expect most of
these boys will not survive.

( coughing )

Sir?

I'm capable
of writing

my reports to the government,
Mr. Dunnison.

but there will come a time
when I am not.

I'd rather have you
in the habit.

( coughing )

( gasping )

The Lord is coming for me,
Mr. Dunnison.

Sir, then why ride?

I figure it's better
I walk to meet Him...

...than sit and wait.

Hey.

What'd the captain want?

He's dying.

Our captain is dying.

Rangers!

Our mission is to stop

the outlaw John King Fisher.

Fisher and his men
have been burning ranches

thieving cattle and
driving them into Mexico

where he sells them
to the Mexican army.

More than a million
beeves stolen.

More than
400 men murdered.

We'll be patrolling
border country

to find these animals,
bring them to justice.

U.S. Cavalry's
got a mandate

to settle Indian matters.

Leaves us to protect
the Texan way.

It's our home, Rangers

and we got right
on our side.

Ain't no outlaw
stands a fighting chance!

( gunshots )

( cheering and whooping )

( crowd cheering )

( cheering coutinues )

( bridle clanking )

( horse burring )

Back up, recruit!

This ain't no
goddamn pony ride.

Who you calling recruit?

you're a Browusville sign-up.

I seen you. I been a Ranger
since Franklin.

That's a week and two days.

I know about life on the trail.

One more week, you'll be
eligible for retirement.

Watch it, recruit.

I'll shoot that lip off
at 40 paces.

Name's Berry.
Berry Smith.

Berry? Like blueberry?

Like elderberry to you.

Sergeant sent me
to fill out the dab.

Dab's a usual
three or four Rangers.

We eat together, scout together.

It's us three
and Sandoval.

He's dab leader.

Means we care
for his horse

care for his weapons.

( gunshots )

( whooping and cheering )

( gunshot )

Boy rides a horse like
he's riding his sister.

He knows he's doing
something wrong.

Ten cents says
he's saddle sore.

20 cents says he's
dead by Sunday.

Ain't taking that bet.

Anybody see the way this scout
killed those bandits?

Anybody see the way
this scout

killed those bandits?

( rapid gunfire )

Damn!

Sam, I'll bet you I can draw

faster than you can say
"peppercorn."

Peppercorn.

just say it.

Pep-pep-pep-pep-pep...

( gunshots )

Fast!

I'm fast, I'm fast

--I'm fast!
--So fast you're six feet under.

Missed that target
every time, Mr. Durham.

gun's no good unless
you got smarts with it.

Yes, sir, Captain.

Frank, from now on

Mr. Durham pays
for his ammunition.

A penny a miss.

Yes, sir, Captain.

( gunshots )

( tin can falling )

Peppercorn.

FISHER:
I'm telling you,
General Cortinas

the Republic of Texas
is there for the taking.

What you're suggesting
is full-scale war.

The union Army's up north,
fighting the Indians.

Hell, there ain't no law
south of Austin.

We heard McNelly's
been commissioned

to start up the Rangers.

McNelly's got 30 men,
General, 30.

We'd have an army.

For the next shipment, senor...

we will meet you.

--Shit!
--Damn, Dunnison.

Ain't there anything
you're good at?

I'd love to show you, Scipio,
but I don't think

we'll be meeting any women
along the way.

Dunnison, you rope
yourself a woman

I'll drink the Rio Grande.

( laughing )

( chuckling )

you want something, Sam?

( stuttering ):
When you're wri-wri-writing

for the Captain in his tent

you see any ma-ma-maps in there?

Maps?

I seen the ma-maps he s-studies
with the s-sergeant

and they're pretty b-b-b...

Bad, Sam?

Mm-hmm.

My pa-pa-papa taught me

how to blaze t-t-trails
and k-k-keep maps.

Might be
wo-wo-worthwhile

having somebody
to ma-ma-make maps

of the t-t-territory

while we ride.

Dunnison:
Captain, Mr. Walters
was speaking to me

about the charts and maps
you're working with

and he wanted
to present you

with what we think
is a preferable scenario.

Sam.

W-W-Well...

Captain, I w-w-wanted

to s-s-see...

I w-wanted to s-see

if you're the kind of man

who'd beg for his
life like a dog

or swallow the bullet
like a sorry soldier.

( grunts and groans )

Stay down!
Stay down, you son of a bitch.

Well...

Captain Cutthroat McNelly--

the man the whole union
Army conldn't kill.

Shot down by Sam Walters

of San Antone.

Fisher knows

you're riding the Rangers,
Captain.

He's put a sweet price
on your sad hide.

( pained groaning )

Suck my spurs,
you secretary!

I brought a bullet
for you, too.

Turn around, McNelly.

And stop your shifting
or I'll shoot.

Brave Sam Walters--
shot McNelly in the back.

( groaning )

How's that
for a storybook?

Turn around, McNelly.

Right in the back,
Sam shot him.

Right in the back.

I said

turn around!

( gasps )


( sighs quietly )

( clicks tongne )

( horse whinnies )

you riding somewheres,
Mr. Dunnison?

Riding out
of Ranger Company, sir.

Company's captain

was nearly killed
due to my conduct.

I don't presume myself welcome
to wear this anymore.

Were you set to ride off
with that horse, Mr. Dunnison?

That's a Ranger's horse.

I was hoping I would not be
sent away without a horse, sir.

but hoping to be sent away?

you were nearly killed,
and I was the reason.

I hired Sam Walters on,
Mr. Dunnison.

He stood my scrutiny.

He could've taken his shot at me
at any time.

He had 30 Rangers shined on,
not just you.

Rangers' horse,
Mr. Dunnison.

you ride out,
that horse is stolen.

My men will hunt you down.

Rangers' boots, Rangers'
clothes, Rangers' weapons.

you walk out,
makes them stolen, too.

So it seems to me,
Mr. Dunnison

the only way you
escape a warrant

is to remain a Ranger.

( hooves thundering )

Fisher keeps an outpost
around this mesa.

Freshwater spring
on the other side.

Water for the horses when
they come from raids.

but do we know
how many?

shouldn't we know how many?

Round that mesa

they'll spot us
well too soon.

Need to send a patrol.

Berry, Durham, Dunnison

ride with Sandoval and me.

Taking a scout, Captain?

Get yourself shot.

Scipio, go get yourself shot.

And don't get shot second;
get shot first, Scipio.

In fact, shoot yourself, Scipio.

Get it over with.

That's the Rangers' way.

( men talking in distance )

( horse approaching )

Five men. Fisher's men, sir.

Armed, and they got
a supply wagon.

--Sandoval.
--Yes, sir.

our mission is

to capture these men
at all costs.

but I want the cost
to be on their side.

When the shooting starts,
these targets

will be shooting back--
not like practice, men.

Anyone surrenders,
we question them

then send them to
Austin for trial.

Remember...

you hesitate, you're dead.

( neighing )

( neighs )

Where are you wandering
off to, huh?

Cheval, huh?

What woman

lost hold of you, huh?

Drop your guns! Stay down!

Texas Rangers!

Say your prayers,
sons of bitches!

Ambush!

( neighing )

( yelling )

Someone throw me a cartridge!
I'm out!

Someone throw me

a cartridge!

Found one.

Wha... uh...

( yells )

( crying )

( both groaning )

( rapid gunfire )
--Get down!

you said there were
five men! Five!

I ain't no scout!

you hear me?
I ain't no scout!

I'm a dag-blasted shooter!

Give me that!

We surrender.

We surrender.

( sighs )

So, ladies, where to next?

Say your names.

Anton Marsele,
from New Orleans.

Jean-Pierre Marsele.
Son frere.

Marsele brothers.

Horse thievery
and livestock

extortion of
merchants and widows

kidnapping...

destruction
of property.

you boys should've stayed
in New Orleans.

Why don't you give us
some more to write in here?

( men gasping, horses neighing )

Attendez! Attendez! Attendez!

We rode for King Fisher.

The saddles were stole

from Sutter Ranch
in Austin.

With cattle, 400 head.

Ten ranch hands died
at the Sutter Ranch.

We kill no one.

Fisher did.

We work for you now.

--For you.
-- Oui.

you work for the Rangers
as a spy?

-- Oui.
-- Oui. Oni, for the Rangers.

For the Rangers.

Ca va marcher,
ca va marcher.

Ils savent pas
a propos des antres.

C'etait pas marqne
daus le mandat.

Mr. Dunnison?

--Sir?
--What'd they say?

They said, "This will work,
this will work.

"They don't know
about the others.

It wasn't in the warrants."

Sandoval.

( men gasping, horses neighing )

( choking and gasping )

These bandits
went down shooting.

Surrender never crossed
their minds.

Their rules, not mine.

but I'll play by them.

We're Rangers, men.

We got right
on our side.

Scipio.

Treat her fine...

rifleman.

Dunnison:
you said we would take
those men prisoner

take them to Austin,
take them to trial.

We did the trial.

That was no trial.

A trial can run a long
time, Mr. Dunnison.

Some can run
up to a year.

A year is something
I do not have.

In the state of Texas,
killers hang.

And if they're not killers,
but we think they're killers

and we don't even stop
to check the warrants?

How long will the war go on...

preacher?

until the wicked are dead

and the meek shall
inherit the earth.

Are we the meek?

The meek will inherit the earth,
Mr. Dunnison.

Someone's got to go
and get it ready for them.

There are bodies

to be buried.

Bury them.

( coughs and spits )

( retching )

( flies buzzing )

Some kind of work, ain't it?

We done killed six men dead.

We ain't even got our $40 yet.

( hooves thundering )

< <

Cattle come through here.

100, maybe 200.

Whoa, now! Get on back!

Rangers got
the Marsele brothers.

What about the gun?

McNelly destroyed it.

Damn.

30 men and horses.

about a hundred beeves.

you know that's
marshland prairie, Captain.

Might want to track them
to a little better terrain.

No better terrain for 20 miles.

And better for us
means better for them.

Might be better to wait.

Wait till what,
they reach reinforcements?

Sandoval??

30 of them, 30 of us.

We wait...
they may have 300.

We'll ride
at full gallop.

They'll see us
on the prairie

and take
defensive positions.

Shoot at the target
forward of you only

and you keep shooting

till you taste that
outlaw's blood.

No prisoners, Rangers.

( men shouting )

Fire!

Hyah!

Get every last one!

( screaming )

Get the others out of hiding.

Let's go, boys!

( all shouting )

( gunshots coutinue )

Jesus Christ.

( horse whinnies )

( grunting )

We don't have the manpower.

They set us up!
We're trapped!

( screaming )

( neighs )

( screaming )

( screaming )

Goddamn.

( yells )

( horse whinnies )

God, not me.

Oh, please God!

Oye, muchacho, por aca.

Stand back!

Stand back!

Don't move!

Oh, God! Oh, God! Get up!

( gun cocking )

( horse whinnies )

Leave them alone!

Their dead alone!

( groans )

No!

Sergeant!

I'm getting you
out of here.

Help me! I surrender!

Help me!

I surrender!

Help me!

I surren--

Retreat, Rangers!

Retreat!

( gunshot rings out )

Durham:
Thank God!

We're retreating!

Come on!
We're retreating!

We're retreating!

Giddup! Let's go!

Next time you train your Rangers

train them
how to run!

Go with God, McNelly.

If the son of a bitch
will have you.

Ride.

( horse whinnies )

( birds chirping )

( chirping coutinues )

( whispers ):
Thank you very much.

Fisher will have
ridden on by dusk.

We'll return to Palo Alto...

get our men.

We'll resupply
and get new recruits

at the ranch
of my old friend

Richard Dukes.

What'd they do with our men?

Cap...

Cut my men down.

Cut them down.

Jesus...

Captain!

or favor...

kill me.

Captain!

Kill me now.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Slow and easy,
?comprende?

Nice and easy,
little lady.

your war's over.

Slow and easy.

( men yelling and whistling )

MAN:
Riders coming in!

Ready yourselves!

Begging your pardon,
Mrs. Dukes.

There's riders, Captain.

Whoa.

Are those the Rangers,
Daddy?

Caroline,
take your sisters inside.

Come on, girls.
There's going to be

a lot of dirty cowboys around.

Got 12 men to bury.

you want to say
some words, Leander?

( sniffling )

WOMAN:
you're welcome, sir.

( indistinct conversation )

Oh, thank you,
ma'am.

No, no.

( belches )

Thank you, ma'am.

Tom?

wouldn't be so bad
to be a ranch hand

around here,
would it?

Probably don't
get shot at much.

I wouldn't even
mind, as long

as it was her
doing the shooting.

( laughing )

Durham:
up there earlier

she was studying me
like an encyclopedia.

I hate to disappoint you,
George, but she was eyeing me.

( laughing ):
The hell she was!

She was. She was studying me
like a Bible.

Well, you study an encyclopedia
a lot harder

than you study a Bible, Lincoln.

Get all that buckshot
out of your ass yet?

Ten more minutes.

Ten more minutes
is about how long

you got to live,
unless you give up

that bath to the man who
could've killed you

when he met you.

George, you couldn't kill
a bottle of mescal

--with a pack of Mexicans.
--Give up the bath.

What the hell are you doing?

--Get the hell out of here!
--Give up the bath!

Have a seat, sonny.
just stay on your side!

Oh, you had
to see that.

She was eyeing me.

( horse whinnies )

( knock at door )

Come in.

Mr. Dunnison.

( McNelly coughs )

November 17.

The men fought bravely,
but I believe it was my mistake

to lead them into a battle
on such arduous terrain.

With no natural defencements,
they were unprepared

to withstand
such a pitched encounter.

I had believed that the numbers
were in our favor.

I had believed that the raiders

would not be as
well-disciplined

as they were.

It was a disastrous decision.

would you agree with that,
Mr. Dunnison?

Dunnison:
It's awfully
kind of you, Miss

to be taking care of
such wrecks like us.

Awfully kind.

Well, it must've been hard.

Were many young like you?

Rest assured, Miss,
we didn't go down
without a fight.

I killed two raiders
myself at close range.

I may have killed a couple
more in the charge.

What were their names?

Pardon?

you had warrants for them,
I trust.

Well, the raiders opened
fire on us, Miss.

There wasn't time to
consult the warrants.

Well, it's just as well.

you know a man's name,
makes it harder

to kill him,
now, doesn't it?

They're outlaws, Miss.

We're Rangers.

When you kill a man
for stealing some cattle

you are saying that his life
is worth as much as that steer.

Leaves you a whole state
full of men thinking that way

and treating other men
the same.

We ride to protect
the state of Texas.

you ride to balance
the blood on the scales.

but some of you--

like your friend--

I look into his eyes,
and I can see it clear.

He's no killer.

George? you looked in his eyes?

( chuckling ):
George?!

Durham:
Miss.

Ladies.

Hey.

you talking to her?

I got nowhere,
George.

Gunslingers.

She likes
gunslingers.

( horses neighing )

Sergeant, what's going on?

Training exercises,
it looks like.

Who organized this?

Philadelphia did.

about damn time.

Peppercorn.

State'll pay you $40 a mouth.

Four men to a dab.

Seven dabs to a company.

you get your pay
from Sergeant Armstrong.

you get your orders from me.

Fire!

( whooping )

( indistinct conversation )

Senorita.

Si.

La Senora wanted you
to have these.

They're yours to keep.

you're safe now.

you're with the Rangers.

Those devils
can't hurt you anymore.

Who say they cannot hurt me
no more?

John Armstrong says.

Senora is...

very kind.

( sniffing )

Who were those men?

Name to me
the devils that hurt you.

We're after those men.

I heard them say they were going
to Amargosa

to do a raid at
the Logan ranch.

( kissing softly )

Thank you.

ARMSTRONG:
Come on, recruits,
let's get ready to move out!

Come on, pack it up!

Let's get ready
to move out, boys.

Let's pack her up!

Saying good-bye?

We, uh...

shot five bandits
over at Palo Alto.

Well, I mean...

I killed.

Judy didn't.

but I was
riding Judy.

Hell, they was dead before they
even saw me draw. Blam, blam!

George, sell it
in the dime stores.

She'd... make
a good ranch horse.

I think you'd make
a good ranch hand.

Dunnison:
Miss Dnkes

hope he hasn't tired you
with all his stories:

all the bad men he's killed,
the hangings, the shoot-outs.

It's so hard
to keep track.

Actually, we were speaking
of a horse.

He killed a horse?

( horse burrs )

Miss Dukes.

McNELLY:
Amargosa's a
40-mile ride

but we'll make it
by nightfall.

Send a man
into Shepardton.

Get a telegram
to Victor Logan.

Tell him to get his
family out of there.

And the Rangers are coming.

( horse neighs )

I made the lady a
promise, Captain.

We're taking her
to Carmargo.

Hyah.

( cattle lowing )

( lowing in distance )

Another hour

and it's sunup.

Any sign over there?

Dust, Captain.

Dust and sky.

Night... why
wouldn't they

raid at night?

She wasn't dead.

I don't follow.

The rest were dead.

And she wasn't.

So why'd they leave her behind?

Hey, Captain!

Captain, wait up!

( gasps )

They let you live! Why?

To say what? What?!

--Stop! you're scaring her!
--Amargosa?

Le diije qne no se!

Captain, she told you
what she heard them say!

What they wanted her
to hear!

What they wanted her to say!

Rangers!

( sobbing )

Men, we are riding back
to Dukes.

Dunnison, Donavan, Scipio

stay behind
with Sergeant Armstrong.

Take Perdita
as our prisoner.

Yeah, but what if
they still raid?

We're not at the raid,
goddamn it!

The raid can only be
at the Dukes Ranch!

Hyah. Hyah!

( horse whinnying )

( creaking in wind )

( horse neighs in distance )

( gunfire, galloping hooves )

( men shouting )

( gunfire coutinues )

Perdita.

you didn't know.

you conldn't have.

Please forgive me.

( groans )

( grunting )

Hyah! Hyah!

Andale, mas rapido!

Ho! Ho!

Rapido, ho!

( groaning )

Duncan!

Scipio!

Hyah!

Hyah! Hyah!

( horse neighs )

Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

Yo, andale.

Yo, andale.

1Andale!

1Arriba, arriba!

1Andale!

Hyah! Hyah!

Hyah!

Hyah!

( horse whinnies )

( grunts )

Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

( whimpers )

Kill me, teijano.

you want to kill me,
kill me!

--Or do you want
to have me first?
--I don't want

to kill you and I don't want to
hurt you-- I want to know why.

They know I'm from Carmargo.
They are riding to Los Cuevas.

They say if I don't say
Amargosa, they kill mi familia.

Tonight?
They ride tonight?

I say Amargosa for
mi padre, mi madre...

( hoofbeats )
--Where are they?

They're riding
for Mexico

crossing at Los Cuevas.

Tell George
to get word

to the company.

We're taking to the trail.

Who taking the trail??

you and I-- Mexico.

Richard!

( horse neighs )

Richard!

( hammers cocking )

( sighs )

Where's Richard?

( cattle lowing )

( men whistling )

Rangers!

Drive the herd!

These are Mexican beeves now!

And the man is

a Mexican man.

( hooves thundering )

Captain Leander McNelly.

I've been waiting for you.

The young
soldier there

has been talking my
ear off since dawn

trying to work
himself a trade.

One Mexican juggler

for one Texas clown.

you send Captain Dukes
across that river

we'll send your girl.

you have my word.

I could use a man
like you, Captain--

a man who can shoot,
a man of his word.

Man could live like a king
in Mexico.

If I was your wife
and boys

Mexico's where I would have
hightailed it by now

instead of waiting
for a killer like you.

Maybe they're here now,
McNelly...

living like kings in Mexico.

Captain Dukes for the girl.

He means nothing to you.

Ah, but he means something
to you.

Richard!

Now we send her!

--No!
--Stand down, Mr. Dunnison.

Dunnison:
What she did was
to save her family.

She's a victim, not an outlaw.

Stand down...

or be shot.

This is not
what Rangers do.

Captain, show them

the difference between them
and us.

Stand down, Dunnison.

The state of Texas commands you

to leave its lands
now and forever.

you will be prosecuted
and imprisoned

should you
ever return.

( gun uncocking )

May God have mercy on your sonl.

PERDITA:
I did what you say!

Yeah, and you'll do what I say
tonight, and you'll do

what I say tomorrow.

Maybe one day
we'll charge admission.

( whips knife )

( guitar musicplaying )

( cattle lowing )

Don't know which
I want to do worse:

kill the son of
a bitch up there...

or go teach him
how to play.

McNELLY:
Take up your pen, Mr. Dunnison.

No notebook, sir?

Take up your pen.

November 19.

I, Leander McNelly,
being of sound mind

do hereby bequeath
my land and property

to the Texas Rangers

to do as
they see fit.

The following
items excepted:

my Navy Colts,
field glasses

and books
on military strategy...

to Lincoln Rogers Dunnison--

a soldier fit to lead.

My Bible I would like
to be buried with.

That is all.

( writing )

( pen clinks into inkwell )

Sir...

In that fort will be
far more than 30 men.

They'll never expect us
to cross

into Mexico.

They'll be well-armed
and well-provisioned.

They've been riding
for weeks, sir.

It's their first night back.

The women, the liquor...
they'll crave sleep.

( McNelly coughing )

( retching )

Bones, start your men
at the front gates.

Baker.

Yes, sir.

Take you men high
to the ridge.

Come on.

( water splashing )

( yells )

Armstrong, Durham, take your men
low to the back gates.

Dunnison and I

will take the front.

Now let's wake them np.

( all yelling )

Caballeros, the tunnels!
Come on!

Let's get in the tunnels!
Move!

Rangers!

( screaming )

Vamonos, apurate!

Charge!

( whooping and cheering )

We're in, Rangers!

Oh, shit!

We're surronnded!

What the hell?? !

( screams )

We're surronnded in the back!

( grunting )

( McNelly cocking gun )

( yelling )

( gun hammer clicks )

I'm out of cartridges!

Someone throw me
a cartridge!

( gunshots in distance )

( hammer clicks twice )

( grunts )

( grunts )

Vamos, rapido!

Heard you were fast.

( yells )

Faster than that.

( grunts )

( grunts )

( gun hammer cocks )

This is only
gonna hurt

for a second.

Maybe two.

( cocks hammer )

Kill him, Mr. Dunnison.

Kill him.

you kill me,
I'll kill him.

( gunshots )

( cocks gun )

( gunshots )

( gunshots )

( grnnts )

Go!

Captain!

Captain, they want
to surrender.

They want to surrender.

No surrender,
right, Captain?

No prisoners, right?

We take back our cattle.

We take them as prisoners.

We take them to trial.

but, Captain...

Those are the terms.

( cattle mooing )

( Rangers whistling )

( cattle lowing in distance )

( McNelly coughing inside )

He wants to see you boys.

( coughing )

When they remember us,
Rangers...

let them remember us not
as men of vengeance...

( coughing )

but... as men of law...

and justice.


( approaching footsteps )

( sighing )

Can't help but think
that they're watching.

Yeah...
I bet they're up there

riding like
the old days.

( horse whinnying )

Hey, Caroline!

( laughing )

Rounding up cattle.

We'll see you tonight!

He'll make
a good rancher.

And whatever else
you've got in mind

he might be all right
at that, too.

He's a good man, Mr. Dunnison.

Ride safe, Mr. Dunnison.

Rangers...

Ride out!

( horses whinnying )

( hooves pounding )
