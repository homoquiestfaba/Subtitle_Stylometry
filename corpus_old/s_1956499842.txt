Two rooms.

You only have two customers.

Slow season.

Well, how do you make a living?

Low overhead.

Occasional opportunity.

The "occasional opportunity"?

You know, where
youâ€™re standing,

thatâ€™s for employees only.

Oh.

Pardon.

Bad neighborhood.

Yeah, it must be.

Shotgun and...

whatever youâ€™ve
got underneath your shirt.

All right.

You guys took your time
circling around...

Yeah, we had to drive
about half a mile

send your picture,

you know,
get confirmation.

Internet sucks.

Should have come in.
Got free Wi-Fi.

How long you had this place?

About a year.

Friend of mine
left it to me.

What we hear,
you donâ€™t have any friends.

Not anymore.

Standing still for a year,

you had to know that
was gonna be too long.

I had obligations, and...

you get tired.

Thatâ€™s something you
should have thought about

in the first place.

You know the story?

We donâ€™t give a shit
about the story.

We hear lots of stories.

See, heâ€™s not gonna
appreciate it, but you might.

A short one, yeah, sure.

Buy you a beer.

You can cut me off
if you get bored.

Me and Franco...

Hey.

On the way,
inside an hour.

Okay.

Hey, you good?

You know anything
about rice cookers?

What?

They come in a travel size.

Think itâ€™s over-priced, though.

What? You want me to do some
research on rice cookers?

Sure.

You know what?
Nah, Iâ€™ll do my own research.

You know what?
Tell me what you find out.

Jesus, you need to get laid.

Who says I donâ€™t get laid?

Hey, Dad.

Hey.

What do you know
about rice cookers?

Not much.

Iâ€™m thinking about getting one.

Why?

I travel a lot.
I eat a lot of rice.

Is rice expensive?

Almost never.

So...

Youâ€™re smart.

Youâ€™re a smart young woman.

Something only
a dad would say.

Well, Iâ€™m sure.

Iâ€™m sure you U Penn
would disagree, right?

Grades are fine
and I got the check.

Thank you.

Didnâ€™t seem like much.

Tuitionâ€™s covered and
I work at the lab a few nights.

Should you be working?

I mean, shouldnâ€™t you
be focused on...

Mom worked through college.

Sheâ€™d have wanted it to
be easier for you.

Iâ€™d rather it wasnâ€™t
too easy, you know?

True.

I donâ€™t know what
your schedule is like,

but Iâ€™ve got a
break coming up.

Yeah, yeah.

Um... yeah, uh-huh.

Yeah, right.

Look, I know...

What did I do, Dad?
Why canâ€™t I see you?

No, you didnâ€™t do anything.

Five years.

Itâ€™s been five years.

Someday Iâ€™m gonna tell
you the reason

and youâ€™ll wish I hadnâ€™t.

Jesus! What am I supposed
to do with that?

This isnâ€™t normal!
The money--

The moneyâ€™s what
Iâ€™ve got right now.

Look, Iâ€™ve gotta get
back to work.

I love you.

I love you too, Dad.

All right, Iâ€™ll buy you
the fuckinâ€™ rice cooker.

Rifle on the other side
of the hot zone.

Two UFOs sitting in a car.

Well, maybe the object.

Without an advance security,
I donâ€™t know.

Maybe police?

No. No, the police
have been managed.

It is definitely
not the police.

-You sure?
-No, no.

Iâ€™m an asshole
who hasnâ€™t kept you alive

and safe for 10 years.

Right down this plate.

78AJUG.

78AUG.

78AJUG.

Take this fuckinâ€™ seriously.

What the fuck...

What?

Call me back.

Hey!

Two is better than one, honey.

Do I make her...
Do I make you nervous?

No, baby, not at all.

No oneâ€™s nervous.

Just thought you might want
a little taste of home.

How you end up down here?

Thereâ€™s a story there.

Storyâ€™s not as sad
as youâ€™re thinking.

Not as different from mine
as youâ€™re thinking.

Which is why I canâ€™t
have you come up here

and make me fall
in love with you.

Go.

Itâ€™s unlocked!

Okay if I turn on a light?

No.

Okay.

Hey.

Walk over to that window.

Take off your top.

Anything under the skirt?

Thatâ€™s good.

Now open the blinds.

Itâ€™s a blue Skoda.
See it?

Theyâ€™re gone, baby.

You know them?

Keep looking out the window.

They cops?

-No.
-How do you know?

I just gave the mean
one a blow job.

That makes them not a cop?

He paid.

They have guns?

I didnâ€™t see.

Theyâ€™re the type that might?

Yeah.

Are you jerking off?

Maybe.

The roof across the street,
the one with the construction.

You see it?

Yeah.

Can you get up there?

Yeah, but itâ€™s empty.
Itâ€™s an empty building.

Nah, my friendâ€™s up there.
Heâ€™s working late.

Close the blinds.

Put your clothes back on.

So you really donâ€™t wanna fuck?

No, not since
my daughter was 14.

You have a phone?

-Here.
-All right.

I want you to go up on the roof
and say hello to Mr. Sanchez.

Whatever he wants, itâ€™s on me.

Like a joke?

Yeah.
Yeah, like a joke.

After, you can have the rest.

Okay.

Thank you.

Bye.

Blue Skoda.
Itâ€™s a rental.

Got a couple names, but
they wonâ€™t mean shit to you

because they donâ€™t
mean shit to me.

-American?
-Out of Miami.

You got a bad feeling about
this, get the fuck out.

I leave without knowing what
the fuck is going on,

then I donâ€™t know what
the fuck is going on.

-Who else is down here?
-What do you mean?

Other tradesmen.
Whoâ€™s active here?

Well, shit. You know,
let me check Facebook.

None of yours?

You know I would
have mentioned it.

Would you?

Probably not,
but Iâ€™m telling you...

Hello?

Let me say hello to my friend.

Itâ€™s for you.

No way.
No way you saw me.

I recognized your
puke green MSR.

You supposed to do me before
or after I take the shot?

Kind of a moot point now.

Come on, Sanchez.

Tits at the window was a
good fuckinâ€™ move, man.

But Iâ€™m always
improving on you.

You donâ€™t think Iâ€™d shoot you
right through her?

Iâ€™m the one person in the
world that knows you wonâ€™t.

One chance. Come over.
Iâ€™ll buy you a beer.

Nah. I donâ€™t drink, Viejo.

Shit, Viejo.
You shoulda took the shot.

Sheâ€™s dead anyway.

But you always did leave
the dirty work for me.

Nah... not like that, Viejo.

So what now?

Window maybe?

You go for the door?

I got all day while you
move the dresser.

Start running, you
double-dealing fuck.

From what? You?

You canâ€™t make a decision
about a fuckinâ€™ rice cooker.

Well, thatâ€™s why you
tipped the target

and sold them Sanchez
to double on me?

Youâ€™re the target,
you asshole.

Who?

I never ask. You know that.

It was money.

And youâ€™re past
your sell-by date.

You donâ€™t fuck anymore,
you donâ€™t drink,

I would have walked away.

You should have
let me walk away.

You try and then a
year or two later,

the pangs of conscience get
worse and worse and worse.

You know it, and then you
go off and tell someone!

Yeah? Yeah? Well, you shoulda
taken a chance, Dean, now, now--

Now, now, now what?

If you make it outta
that room,

youâ€™d better
fuckinâ€™ ghost.

Because the day
youâ€™re spotted,

someone goes to U Penn
to the Ridgeman Dorms.

And then God
knows whatâ€™s gonna--

Fuck you!
Fuck you, Dean!

Fuck you!

Dad...

Hey.

Iâ€™m sorry.

Oh, donâ€™t apologize.

You have nothing
to apologize for.

You grew up so well,
I just figured being around

wouldâ€™ve fucked things up.

But maybe I fucked
up anyway, yeah.

Maybe thereâ€™s just
no right answer, no.

I know you love me.

I know youâ€™re doing your best.

I am. I did.
I am doing my best.

I just, um...

I just want us to be good.

Weâ€™re great, Dad.

Okay, then.

Okay, Dad, goodnight.

Goodnight.

Tell me itâ€™s done.

Yes, sir.

You all right? I know
the two of you had history.

Oh, that was years ago,
not that it wasnâ€™t weird.

Someday youâ€™ll do the
same to me, right?

Not if youâ€™re smarter
than he was.

Should be a red Renault.

Up on blocks?

No one steals a stripped car.

Payment is in the shifter box.

Problem?

No, theyâ€™re here.

Hey, man, you sure
about this shit?

I got GIA certificates.
Donâ€™t worry.

What... what are
GIA certificates?

It means the diamonds
are legit.

Itâ€™s how the client
wanted to pay.

The guy in Panama is set
to convert them for you.

Killing this phone now.
Talk to you in a month.

Hands, fuckface!

Yeah.

Hey.

Hey, come on, man.
Stripping a stripped car?

Doesnâ€™t make sense.

Ah, fuck!

Try me.

-All right.
-You fuckinâ€™ angry?

And I believe
he intended to shoot you.

Looked that way, didnâ€™t it?

Who gave me up?

All right, thatâ€™s good.
Itâ€™s a good sign.

Yeah?

If you were gonna dump me
on the side of the road,

youâ€™d tell me, right?

Unless...

You can shut up now.

Oh, shit. I see.

Itâ€™s G-Manâ€™s snitch and
he doesnâ€™t trust you.

Hey, man, seriously, man.

How long we been
working together, man?

You still canâ€™t speak
decent fuckinâ€™ Spanish?

I know enough to know
when Iâ€™m being rat-fucked.

Hey, I donâ€™t give
a shit which one of you

I make a deal with, all right?

Oh, motherfucker!
That was a good one!

You want me to shut
the fuck up, buddy?

Youâ€™re gonna have to
hit me harder than that.

Thatâ€™s just turning me on.

Jesus, Miguel...

Miguel... youâ€™re just
encouraging him!

Itâ€™s a long fucking
ride, you know.

It keeps me awake.

Oh, yeah?
Long ride to where?

Huh?

Where we going?

Look, the diamonds
are worth 250.

First one of you
kills the other,

Iâ€™ll bump it another 250.

Thatâ€™s 375 more than
either of you is expecting.

You know Iâ€™m good for it.

I got it.

Oh, shit, look.
Heâ€™s thinking about it.

You better act fast. Your man,
heâ€™s thinking about it.

â€™Cause heâ€™s gonna trust a greasy
piece of shit like you, hmm?

Oh!

What the fuck are
you doing, man?

Hey, man, come on.

This making you
fuckinâ€™ feel better? Relax.

Fuckinâ€™ relax.

Iâ€™m relaxed.

Hey, you know what?
G-Man is trying to figure out

how to fuckinâ€™ shoot you
from the back seat...

Just pull over, man.
Let me break his jaw.

Itâ€™s just words, man.

What the fuck you
care about words?

Pull over. Let me break
his fuckinâ€™ jaw!

500! 500! 500!
Just get this shit movinâ€™!

Just get--

What?

Now weâ€™re riding around
with a dead fuckinâ€™ body, man.

Itâ€™s not the first time.

Pull over. Weâ€™ll throw
him in the trunk.

Clean up a little.

Quit fucking with me.

Seriously, how much money
have we made together?

Not this much, man.
Not all at once.

Fuck you, man, fuck you.

Exactly. Thatâ€™s what
Iâ€™m afraid of, man.

Exactly that.

So, what?
Whatâ€™s the plan here?

You just gonna drive
around all night?

This car doesnâ€™t
run outta gas?

You know what?
Itâ€™s okay, man.

Just empty your fuckinâ€™ gun
and itâ€™s fine. Itâ€™s fine.

Empty?

You fucking kidding me?

Iâ€™m not fucking
kidding you, motherfucker!

You know weâ€™re
through after this.

Yeah, Lance, I fuckinâ€™ know.

No.

Iâ€™ll fuckinâ€™ shoot you, Lance.

-Youâ€™re gonna anyway.
-No, Iâ€™m not.

Then unload your gun.

Iâ€™m not fuckinâ€™ doing that.
You crazy?

â€™Cause I can trust you,
but you canâ€™t trust me?

Well, you shot the
fucking guy, man--

Because he was getting
in our heads!

He got us here!

Well, Lance...

Here we are.

Partner?

Yeah.

Here we are.

Okay, man.

Fuck!

Thatâ€™s it.

Tell me youâ€™re not
gonna run, partner?

Not while I got the diamonds!

Sorry, Miguel.

Agh!

Open the kit.
See what we got.

Not a lot.

Well, do what you can.

We gotta figure out a story.

What happened?

It...

...got a little messy.

Oh, Lance.

Oh, weâ€™re okay, weâ€™re okay.

He shot me.

Not through and through, is it?

The bullet come out
the other side?

Is there a hole?

No.

Right on the money, huh?

My man was right on the money.

And all it cost was
a little part of my soul,

the part I wasnâ€™t using.

Miguel was bad,
bad as me...

but I shouldnâ€™t
have shot him.

You killed him for me.

He didnâ€™t give me a choice.

But if Iâ€™m being honest,
I knew he wouldnâ€™t.

Even if he knew why,
I needed it all.

I think I would
have been better if I--

No.

Nothing is better than this.

Yeah? Yeah?

Listen to me, Aranaâ€™s
meeting us at Hotel del Franco

with a new passport
and papers.

Get you on the plane to Bonn.

I come by with a
new passport in a week,

new identities
for both of us.

Then...

Then?

Itâ€™s fucking happening.

A year, but
itâ€™s happening.

Thereâ€™s no way she could
have followed me here.

Puta! Iâ€™m not going to kill you!
I love you!

Fucking love you!

Arana gets the biggest diamond.
Thatâ€™s his payment. Got it?

We are doing this together.

Please!

Iâ€™ll meet you at the hotel.

Hey, Ericson!

You think being a
cop protects you?

You think being
an American protects you?

You fucked my woman!

Iâ€™m gonna fucking kill you!

Go. Go!

Come out...

Street. One night.

Iâ€™m supposed to ask for ID
and a credit card.

Okay.

If you need anything...

You here all night?

I was gonna say, "Dial 00."
Yes, I am.

Bourbon and tequila
and bourbon.

And beer.

Tequila and beer.

Thought you were the clerk.

Clerk, bartender,

security guard, owner.

Owner? What happened to Franco?

You know Franco?

No. I read the sign.

I won this place
in a poker game.

Really?

It was a long game and it turns
out itâ€™s not worth that much.

Is that why you do
everything yourself?

I have people during the day.
At night, though...

You like the quiet?

I donâ€™t get
much sleep anyway.

Bad dreams?

What makes you say that?

Everyone has bad dreams.

Thatâ€™s not your real answer.

Thatâ€™s what you came up
with right after

you wished you hadnâ€™t
asked the question.

You talk to all your hotel
guests like this?

You know a man named Arana?

Spanish for "spider", right?

I donâ€™t know him. Iâ€™m supposed
to be meeting him here.

Meeting a guy named Arana?

Nothing good can come of that.

You mean, a woman like me
meeting a guy named Arana?

Well, I think youâ€™ve met some
Aranas in your time,

probably some Snakes
and Lobos too.

What makes you say that?

Just... the way you drink,
how nervous you are...

How nervous youâ€™re not.

Francoâ€™s dead, isnâ€™t he?

The back of your neck,
that scarâ€™s from a knife.

The one on your hand,
thatâ€™s from a bullet.

Maybe I had one
really bad day.

You have the eyes and
the hands of a violent man.

I know, because
I know violent men.

So the questions are...

did Franco die by
your hand and why?

And does a violent man
really think

heâ€™s gonna find peace
behind a hotel desk?

What are the answers?

Those arenâ€™t my questions.

Iâ€™ll bill your room.

Your business is
worse than mine.

Itâ€™s all about the quality,
not the quantity.

Does it get lonely wandering
around that empty hotel?

I see people walk in,
take one look around

and walk right back out.

Maybe Iâ€™m turning them away.

Mm.

Me too.

Only tonight, this guy wanted
to fall in love with me.

Thereâ€™s always that danger.

Seen Gigi?

Not for a few hours.

She must have
gone home, then.

Guess Iâ€™ll do the same.

You know, I see
you almost every night

and steal your cigarettes.

You never once asked me
to throw you one.

And you never once asked me
how I ended up down here.

You never asked me either.

Thatâ€™s what we like
about each other.

So whatâ€™s the pitch?

The pitch?

Iâ€™m not delusional enough
to think you find me
irresistible.

No.

Youâ€™re a man who understands
the mechanics of this world,

but not its appetites.

It has got me this far.

Would you walk out
of here tonight?

Where would I be walking to?

Would you?
For the right reason?

Whatâ€™s a right
reason look like?

When you played
cards with Franco

and he put the deed
down to this place,

what gave it value to you?

Money, pleasure?

So weâ€™re not
discussing reasons.

Weâ€™re negotiating payment.

Would you prefer a cause?

You donâ€™t strike me
as a cause.

More of a rabbit hole.

A rabbit hole.

I fall into you
knowing full well

thereâ€™s going to be
a hard landing.

Iâ€™m getting out of a
difficult situation,

becoming a new person,

a person I thought
I would have been by now.

Arana is giving you
a new identity,

way out of the city?
The country?

It has to be quickly, tonight.

Because youâ€™re using
someone elseâ€™s money.

-I donâ€™t see it that way.
-But someone does.

Youâ€™re right.

Iâ€™ve known Aranas and Snakes.

I know how to handle them.

But they donâ€™t know
that at first.

At first, itâ€™s easier
to have someone like me around

to deal with
the Snakes and Aranas.

But you couldnâ€™t have planned
for that, for me being here.

A plan is just an action
that you sit and contemplate

for so long that it
becomes complicated.

Iâ€™d rather move from
opportunity to opportunity.

I saw your knuckles,
your scars.

And I recognized
an opportunity,

same as you saw in me.

Iâ€™m not the guy
you think I am.

You donâ€™t want to be,
but you are.

If I could go,
I would, but I canâ€™t.

Canâ€™t or wonâ€™t?

You think Iâ€™d say no to you
if I had the choice?

Well, it seems like you are.

It really is canâ€™t.

Though I donâ€™t like my chances
with you... or her.

Sheâ€™ll kill me.

And me, if she smells
your perfume.

Behind the staircase, thereâ€™s
an exit out into the alley.

I have to go back
to my room first.

For money you
donâ€™t think is hers?

Itâ€™s worth way
more than this hotel,

way more than
what Franco died for.

Thatâ€™s not gonna make
me move any faster!

All right, all right.

Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m sorry.

Donâ€™t shoot, donâ€™t shoot,
please.

-Oso!
-Sorry. Donâ€™t shoot.

Iâ€™m sorry.

This was Francoâ€™s place.

Yeah, he sold it to me.

When was that?

Uh, about a week
before he disappeared.

You got proof?

You need it?

Do you know who I am?

Not specifically,
but you are a type.

I am a type.

Are you a type, too?

Yeah, the kind that doesnâ€™t
want to get shot.

Good, because the
whores may like you,

but they answer to me.

A girl came in traveling light,

probably offered to fuck you
not to tell me sheâ€™s here.

Well, now I wish she would
have shown up a little later.

Yeah, Room 27, up
the stairs on the left.

She in?

I donâ€™t know.
I was in my office.

You know, I donâ€™t have
all the answers.

Ola?

Um... Ola?

You could have given her
any key, any goddamn room.

The one with your
suitcase in it.

Sheâ€™ll sit and wait a while.

Buys you time
to get out of here.

Sheâ€™ll hunt me down
and kill me.

I donâ€™t think so.

You donâ€™t either.

You think you can talk
your way out of this,

probably have before.

Now the questions are,
should you?

And is your friend worth
more to you than

whatever you stole
from her?

Theyâ€™re not my questions,
of course.

You might want to go out
through the alley

and come back in through
the front.

For appearances sake.

Mm.

Salud.

You fuck her?

Either way, sheâ€™s going
to say that you did.

And then?

We already killed
her lover tonight.

So here we are.

I wouldnâ€™t be
sitting there too long.

I was thinking the same thing.

You think that thumb trick
would work a second time?

Think itâ€™s the only trick
I know?

Love.

Whatever she thinks
will make it stop.

I wasnâ€™t waiting to start.

Of course.

You donâ€™t
mean shit to her.

You get that, right?

Not to her.
To you, though.

Do you think you can run
far enough, fast enough?

I think Iâ€™m pretty light
on my feet.

Not with her hanging
onto your fucking legs!

Whatâ€™s the offer?

What do you want?

You just made an argument
for killing you.

Donâ€™t ask me what you
think your fucking
goddamned life is worth.

She took jewelry,
maybe $100,000 in cash,

hidden here
somewhere for sure.

Shoot her and itâ€™s
all fucking yours.

I donâ€™t have
anything against her.

You donâ€™t have
anything against me either.

I kind of donâ€™t like you.

And I did enjoy fucking her.

Just kill this
fucking bitch so we can
walk out of here, please.

You picked the wrong
one this time.

Heâ€™s not a killer.

Sheâ€™s right.

Bullshit!

Because you were looking
at the scars,

not at the man who
lost the taste for it.

Now get your purse and
get out of here!

-And then what?
-She gets a head start.

And you get what she
stole from me?

Maybe.
Back up!

-Fuck, no!
-Fuck, yes!

No! Fuck, no!

-Fuck you!
-Fuck, no!

You fucking bitch!

You bitch.

I assumed you had
a gun in your purse.

I did. I just got
to the knife first.

We need to get rid of the body.
Bring my car around back.

Clean up the blood
the best you can.

And then roll her up
in the bedspread.

Okay.

First, though, the money
and the jewelry.

It goes in the safe until
after sheâ€™s outta here

so you donâ€™t get the idea
to leave me with this.

And after?

I donâ€™t take money
I didnâ€™t earn.

I know it sounds
unlikely but...

Youâ€™re just gonna
have to wait and see.

And the rest?

Thatâ€™s all.

Except for what you were
gonna pay Arana in your bra

on your left breast where
you kept me from touching you.

I mean, Iâ€™d love to
go looking for it.

But nowâ€™s not the time, is it?

You might want to clean
yourself up a little too.

Two rooms.

You only have two customers.

Slow season.

How do you make a living?

Low overhead.
Occasional opportunity.

The "occasional opportunity".

You know, where youâ€™re standing,
thatâ€™s for employees only.

Oh. Pardon.

Bad neighborhood.

Yeah, it must be.

Shotgun and whatever you
got underneath your shirt.

All right.

You guys took your time
circling around...

Yeah. We had to drive
about half a mile

to send your picture,
get confirmation.

Internet sucks.

Shouldâ€™ve come in.
Got free Wi-Fi.

How long have
you had this place?

About a year.

A friend of mine
left it to me.

Well, we hear you
donâ€™t have any friends.

Not anymore.

Standing still for a year,

you had to know that
was gonna be too long.

I had obligations, and...

you get tired.

That something you
couldâ€™ve thought about

in the first place.

You know the story?

Nah, we donâ€™t give a shit
about the story.

We hear lots of stories.

See, heâ€™s not gonna appreciate
it, but you might.

A short one?
Yeah, sure.

Iâ€™ll buy you a beer.

You can cut me off if
you get bored.

Me and Franco...

-Franco like this place?
-Yeah.

This is him.

He had a different
name before.

He changed it after
he bought this place.

Cheaper than buying a new sign.

Actually, a lot
more expensive.

See, me and Franco
used to be you and you.

I guess I was you because
Franco wasnâ€™t an asshole.

The organization
found us doing PMC work.

PMC?

Private Military Contractors,

mercenaries,
ex-Rangers, ex-Seals.

Which were you?

Franco was a Ranger.

I was a... truck driver.

Saved his life,
more by accident

than anything else,
if Iâ€™m being honest.

He took me under his wing.

You know, youâ€™re not helping me
keep this story short.

Our people hired
you and Franco?

Is it okay if I
fix myself a drink?

Please do.

Turned out we were working for
them and didnâ€™t even know it.

Cameroon.

I learned why they called
them "blood diamonds".

Franco was a genius
at that shit.

How to track people down,

when to kill them,
when to let...

What did the
organization tell you?

That you stole money.

That would be part of
the cautionary tale.

So after Cameroon,
Franco and I are sent

all over the world
taking care of shit.

Ah! Thatâ€™s me and him.

Right.

Seven years ago, Mexican Border
Patrol seizes the shipment.

Me and Franco were sent
south with a bag of money.

Cops tried to haggle for more.

So the organization says,
"Teach â€™em a lesson!

Burn the shipment!
Bring back the money!"

Which was good and well.
Nothing new.

Except it was
a shipment of girls,

Eleven, ten.

Nine years old.

Yeah, so...

Aw, this is bullshit.

Now why the fuck would
I make up a story like this?

So I wouldnâ€™t kill you.

Jesus Christ!
You are fucking dim.

I was you, remember?

I heard plenty of stories,
worse stories!

Itâ€™s all secondhand.
Itâ€™s abstract to you.

Itâ€™s not staring at a cage
full of little girls

and know...

light them on fire,
or never go home.

So you kept the money
and bolted?

And cut the girls loose.

Any one of the three things
was enough to get us killed.

But my feeling is
setting the girls loose

was what really
pissed them off

because then they had
to send someone else

to hunt them down
and round them up.

And do what we didnâ€™t.

Someone with a tolerance for
that kind of heinous shit.

Maybe even an appetite for it.

So they died anyway?

All of that was for nothinâ€™.

Didnâ€™t seem like it at the time,
not for Franco, especially.

He took one of the girls.

No, you assholes,
not like that!

A switch flipped,
rolled him back past

working for the organization,
back past the merc shit

in Cameroon, back to the guy
he imagined heâ€™d be

when he signed up to
fight for his country!

He wanted to be a good guy,
a decent guy.

Bought this place,
bought a new identity.

He raised that girl
like a daughter.

This guyâ€™s fuckinâ€™ dead.

Yeah, I poisoned him.
Weâ€™re almost to that part.

Relax.

If Iâ€™d been able to pull
that trick twice

we wouldnâ€™t
still be talking.

Letâ€™s just do this, man.

/You want to hear
the end, donâ€™t you?

I mean the thought of
walking out of here

and never having
got to the point?

Franco and the girl?

His daughter for all
intents and purposes!

And just like
any other daughter,

she turned 17 and decides
that she hates him.

Gets involved with some asshole,
convinces her to mule E.

Doesnâ€™t even make it out of town
before sheâ€™s picked up

by this tag team local
policia and federal agent,

Miguel Garcia
and Lance Ericson.

What happens next
is anybodyâ€™s guess.

Suffice it to say
the pills disappear.

Then the girlâ€™s body
turns up in a field...

naked, tortured...

cut into pieces!

So what do you think Franco,
hardcore soldier,

mercenary, professional killer
like your own bad selves,

what do you think
he does next?

He goes after the motherfuckers.

Goes after the motherfuckers!

So insane with grief,
he forgets every lesson

he ever taught me about
patience, about stealth.

And I didnâ€™t stop him.

I didnâ€™t stop Franco.

Just like I didnâ€™t stop...

Heâ€™s an unguided missile.

And these cops donâ€™t
exist in a vacuum.

Theyâ€™re on the payroll
of a very bad woman...

A woman who doesnâ€™t
give a shit about

anybodyâ€™s adopted daughter,
his boss,

who also happens to be dead

rolled up in
a bedspread upstairs!

So thatâ€™s why you
been here a year?

Yeah.

Getting even for your
dumb ass friend fucking up

getting even for his
dumb ass not-even-daughter?

I take it back, man.

That is the saddest fuckinâ€™
story Iâ€™ve ever heard.

Iâ€™m not surprised
you see it that way.

You cut it close,
settling accounts

right before we found you.

I let you find me.

You wanna die?

Well, letâ€™s just say
Iâ€™ve had a good meal,

and Iâ€™m
not hungry anymore.

And because the money wonâ€™t
do me any good anymore,

thereâ€™s a safe in my office.

Cash, jewelry,

plus about $250,000
in diamonds.

This is the combination.

You should have listened
to your own story.

Thatâ€™s not enough
to buy us off.

-Itâ€™s not even close.
-I know.

Itâ€™s motivation for the person
Iâ€™ve really been talking to.

You had to hear
the fucking story, huh?

Letâ€™s go!

Ah!

Woo!

Come on.

Almost worth seeing what you
think you can do with that.

But I been trying to
get the fuck outta here

for the last half hour.

In my day, a professional
wouldnâ€™t use a strange gun

without checking it first.

Letâ€™s go get your stuff.

Youâ€™re Arana.

I used a cutout to deal
with your girlfriend,

but, yeah, pretty much.

Bad news is, I donâ€™t have
a new identity for you.

Good news is, with her dead,
you donâ€™t need one.

You couldnâ€™t have known.

Not everything.

You leading her to me
was definitely Plan B.

Plan A was her and
Lance killed each other.

And maybe me.

I would have felt
badly about that.

Not badly enough.

No.

Took them out of Cameroon.

Never felt right
about spending them.

And those two out there?

Bought me some time
before their people

send the next pair
looking for me.

I hate to cut this short,

but I have a few last things
to do before I go.

Go where?

What if Iâ€™d killed Sanchez?

There was a Plan C.

I didnâ€™t kill those girls.

I couldnâ€™t.

You didnâ€™t stop it.

No.

I didnâ€™t.

I havenâ€™t been right since.

I havenâ€™t been able
to look at my daughter.

You want me to say Iâ€™m sorry?

You want me to say anything
other than fuck you?

Oh, well, you donâ€™t
have the right.

No, I donâ€™t.

The guy you hired me through,

when he finds out
that Sanchez is dead,

heâ€™s gonna go
after my daughter.

Her numberâ€™s in there.

Itâ€™s the only number in there.

Thatâ€™s not my problem.

You set this in motion!

What do you expect me to do?

What you seem to do best.

Just think of something.

Oh, for Christâ€™s sake.
