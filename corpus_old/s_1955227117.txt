WOMAN: Once again, you've judged
a reflection of yourselves.

Your children will rise up

And kill you.

Your own children saw...

What you've done.

They see what you're doing
to your world.

They see that you lie.

They see that you kill
your own love every day,

That you lock your love
in prisons,

That you lock your concern up,
that you lock your truth up.

The truth is locked up.

And now you've judged yourselves
once again.

L.A. will burn to the ground.

Los Angeles will burn
to the ground.

Friday night in Los Angeles,

A movie actress
and four of her friends

Were murdered,

And the circumstances
were lurid.

MAN: Two of the bodies
were found inside the house,

Uh, one in the vehicle,
and two on the front lawn.

*

LINDA: I don't know
how it happened,

How it all came to this,

Something we could no longer
control.

*

[Squish, blood splatters]

Who's that?

It's Linda.

Oh.
Come sit with me, honey.

Later, George.

[Children shout playfully]

LINDA: A month ago,
this place was paradise.

We were a family.
The ranch was all about love.

What are you up to?
Oh, not much.

I just, uh, thought I'd
take Tanya on a walk.

Oh, cool.
Uh, but it's not mommy time.

Just this once?
It's so pretty out today.

You know the rules.

You'll see her at dinner.

*

I love you, baby.

Charlie says it's on
for tonight.

And this time,
you're not just watching.

*

LINDA: Leaving my daughter

Was the hardest thing
I've ever done,

But I had no choice.

[Engine starts]

[Engine revs]

[Women singing indistinctly]

* ...will stay the same

* Time is love
and love is free *

* Life is living,
can't you see? *

* Hand in hand
and arm in arm *

* We go our separate ways

[Horn blares, tires screech]

Aah!

[Car door closes]

[Knocks on door]


I need your help.

Oh, yeah?

What about your "family"?

I'm not with them anymore.

Oh, I thought Charlie was
your savior,

"Christ come back to Earth"?

I had to get out.

Where's Tanya?

She's... still at the ranch.
You left her there?!

I had to! Okay,
you don't understand.

No, I do understand that
you took my kid and split

And took my money, okay!

I need you to come with me
to get her.

Pfft.
I can't do it alone.

Something happened,
something bad.

There's no way in hell
I'm going to that ranch.

That Manson guy is crazy,
all right?

He's a freak!
Bob, please!

You left her there!
You get her!


LINDA:
I was desperate, scared.

I had nowhere else to go.

[Engine rumbles]

My only choice was to get back

To the very place
I'd escaped from.

WOMAN: You're not going
anywhere.

Yeah? Who's gonna stop me?

You are 16 years old!
You are not going to California!

What is this all of a sudden?
What happened?

Ask your husband.
[Dog barking]

What did he do?

Doesn't matter.

Linda, tell me.

He's just an ass.

He's not that bad.

Yeah.

You don't know anyone
in California.

I'll be fine, mom.

*

LINDA: I bounced around
for a few years.

It was pretty easy to get by.

There's always someone
who'd let you crash.

And L.A.?
It's basically paradise.

*

Bob and I fell in love
and got married.

We scrounged around,
lived on communes,

But we got by.

It didn't take much
to make us happy.

Then I got pregnant.

*

Where are you going?

South America with Mateo.
I told you.

No, you didn't.

I was gonna do that trip
with you, remember?

Linda, it's not a vacation,
all right? It's business.

So you're just taking off?

What about me and Tanya?

I can score stuff down there
cheap, all right? I have to.

You took the last
of the money.
I need cash!

Maybe ask your mom
if she can wire you something.
My mom?

I haven't talked to her
in years. You know that.
[Engine starts]

They're gonna leave without me.
I have to go. I'm sorry.

[Engine revs]

*

[Indistinct conversations]

[Utensils clatter]

[Indistinct conversations
continue]

*

[Lowered voice]
Follow my lead.

*

Over there, in the corner!

[Women gasp and scream]

Come on.

MAN: Come on, come on.
[Woman gasps]

Saw it in a movie.
It works every time!

Follow me, little birdie.
Come get in the car.

Why did you do that for me?

You're down to loose change,
right? Been there.

So what's your name?
I'm Linda. This is Tanya.

Hey, do you guys need
a place to crash?

Um...
Hey, come to our ranch.

Spahn Ranch out in Chatsworth.
You'll love it.

A ranch? Like, a real one?

Yep! And more...
drugs, guys, food.
[Engine starts]

And Charlie.

Who's Charlie?

Everything.

Seriously, you'll love him,
and he'll love you and you.

[The Seeds' "No Escape"
playing]

* Nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide *

* I can't kill
this pain inside *

* What can I do
when your love's gone? *

* All I can do is
I just live on *

* No escape from your heart

* No escape from your lips

* No escape from you, baby,
you bring the tears *

* No escape from you, darlin'

Wow.
[Children shouting playfully]

Right?
You haven't seen nothin' yet.

Hi. I'm Leslie.

Hi.

You're the only
Gemini here.

Good energy.
That's outta sight!
[Child shouts playfully]

Hey, I'm Patty.
Hi.

Do you like dollies?

Ooh. Yeah.

Welcome, both of you.

Thank you.
Hey! How are ya?

Hi.
I'm Lynne.

But everyone calls her
"Squeaky."


This place used to be
a real movie ranch.

That's George Spahn.
He owns it now.

Charlie worked a deal with him
to let us stay here.

We help with the chores,
we get free rent.

Why do they call her Squeaky?

Well, we've all got
our signature sounds, right?

[High-pitched moaning]
Ah. [Laughs]

[Engines rumbling]

[Engines turn off]

What do we have here?

SUSAN: This is Linda.

I'm Bobby. That's Tex.

We're, uh, gonna take a swim
later if you're up for it.

Come on, guys, her some room.


That's a cute kid
you got there.

Thank you.

SUSAN: Come on. Come on.

*

You can go check out
the rest of the place.

I'll watch Tanya for you.

Are you sure you don't mind?

We all help each other.

Okay. Bye, baby.

TANYA: Bye.
Bye.

You can sleep here.

Yeah, it gets sort of tight.

And we don't pair up.
Everyone's with everyone.

Charlie says when you couple up,
you act like you own each other.

Where's Tanya's daddy?
Were you guys shacked up?

He split?

Pretty much. Yeah.

Possessions, man.

Here, we don't own anything.
Makes us free.

I like that.

People come and go,

But...

I've got a good feeling
about you.

So do I. [Chuckles]

[Front Page Review's
"Silver Children" playing]

* Silver children

* They shine brightly

* Silver children


[Continues moaning]

*

So what's he like?

Who, Charlie?
Mm-hmm.

He just... he knows stuff
about the world, about life,

About what it means,

Why we're really here.

He's full of love,
which is bizarre.

What do you mean?

Well, I mean, he was in prison
most of his life.

He's only been out
the last two years.

What'd he do?

Doesn't matter.
It's not important.

We've all made mistakes.
I know I have.

Yeah, me, too.

But he'll love you anyways.

I mean, that's what
family's about.

[Dog barking in distance]

You've come a long way
to be here.

[Floorboards creaking]

*

You have a father thing,
don't you?

How did you know that?

I can feel it.

No more fear, Linda.

You feel that?

That's you...

Inside me.

I'm here now.

Mm.
[Woman laughs]

[Fire crackling,
crickets chirping]

I was working at this bar
in North Beach.

It was a real dive.
[Lighter clicks]

Were you a waitress?

Mnh.

"Exotic entertainer."


In other words, a stripper.


But I went to this party
one night after work,

And, uh, Charlie was there.

He had a guitar,
and he was singin',

And he was surrounded
by a bunch of girls.

And I just thought,
who the hell is this guy?

What song?

"Shadow of Your Smile."

No! Tony Bennett?
That's hysterical!

You never told us
that before.

Well, you never asked.


But I just had to get
his attention.

And... I play a little.

Yeah.
Mm.

When he was finished, I asked
if I could borrow his guitar.

And when I was done,

He said it was even better

Than the song I played
in his dreams.

And it was right then,
I knew, I knew,

Charlie was something...

I'd been waiting for.
I didn't know what it was.

I just knew he was it.

So intense. [Laughs]

I was working
in an accountant's office.

No way.

But get this... before that,
she was gonna be a nun.

Yes.

I know, right?
It's... it was my parents' idea.

I left home because...

There was nothing
to keep me there.

Just... strangers occupying
the same house.

Charlie saved us
from our parents

And gave us back to ourselves.

Mm.
Anyway, um...

I was in this coffee shop
on my lunch break,

And I didn't know
that he was there.

He was outside...

Charlie's eyes, they...
they weren't looking at me,

They were looking into me.
SQUEAKY: Exactly.

PATRICIA: Next thing I knew,
I was outside.

He took my hand,

Put it on his heart,

And he said I was beautiful.

No one had ever
said that to me before.

And suddenly, I wasn't alone.

CHARLIE:
No one should be alone.


You know,
you gals have been so good.

We're gonna go out tomorrow.

We are?

Where?


Well, you'll just
have to wait and see.


[The Turtles' "Happy Together"
playing]

* Imagine me and you, I do

* I think about you
day and night *

* It's only right to think about
the girl you love *

* And hold her tight,
so happy together *

* If I should call you up
Hey, hey, hey! Charlie!

What's up, man?

LINDA: Everyone wanted
to be around Charlie.

* Imagine how the world
could be... *

Like the party didn't start
until he got there.

* So happy together

* I can't see me lovin'
nobody but you *

* For all my life

* When you're with me, baby,
the skies will be blue *

* For all my life

* Me and you and you and me

* No matter how they tossed
the dice *

* It had to be

* The only one for me is you

* And you for me

* So happy together

* I can't see me loving
nobody but you *

* So happy together

* Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba

[Song ends]


This is so good!
Mm-hmm.

Have you tried the shrimp?
You have to try the shrimp.

A meatball. Try a meatball.

[Indistinct conversations]

Is that...

Dennis Wilson?

No way.

This is his house.

Charlie knows
all the Beach Boys.

That's Terry Melcher.
He's producing Charlie's record.

CHARLIE:
* Your soul is see-through

* I'm looking into you,
look into me *

* Lookin' at you

*

* Inside your mind,
you toss and turn *

* I don't know why
you got to hurry *

* When I'm calling your name

*

* Break through the chains
that tie you down *

* Forsake the circus
and the clowns *

* I'm calling your name

*

* Truth is always
turned up loud *

* Like a voice above the crowd

* Can you hear me now?

*

Whoo!
[Song ends]

[Cheers and applause]
Yeah!

MAN: Whoo!
Yeah, that's all I'm saying.

Whoo!
You took the lead, man.
I just followed him, brother.

I just followed him.

*

LINDA: There are moments
I'll never forget...

Good ones, perfect ones.

They don't happen much.
At least, they didn't for me.

I finally found my home,

A family that loved me.

I wanted it to last forever.

* He sang

* "Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy,
hurdy gurdy, gurdy" *

* He sang

*

LINDA: We shared everything.

We made love day and night.

The outside world disappeared.

Time didn't exist.

Charlie and the ranch
became our universe.

*

[Children shouting playfully]

[Laughter, waves rolling]

[Child screams]


Come here, Zeozose!

Zeozose?

Yeah. Charlie named him.

Zeozose Zadfrack.

Is he the father?

Spiritually, yeah.

Is everybody havin' fun?

ALL: Yeah!
Whoo!

Well, it's about to get better,

'Cause I got goodies.

CHARLIE: * My hopes, well,
they're high *

* Like the flames in the sky
that you breathe *

* That's the fire

* In me

[Sets down guitar]

Charlie, I want you to know,
I'm ready for this.

Do you trust me?


Do you love me?


I died for you.

Would you die for me?

Yes.

[Inhales sharply]

Your love...

Your spirit...


Overwhelms me.

Charlie, are you crying?

Jesus wept
when he saw Jerusalem.

I weep when I see you?

[Inhales sharply]


[Breathing heavily]




Charlie?

[Door creaks]

Who are you?


I don't know.

Yes, you do.

The strong got no need
to prove it to the phonies.

Your strength

Is within you
if you accept it.

So...

Who are you?

I'm yours.

SQUEAKY:
Why'd you bail on us, man?

I didn't. My mom is sick.

I-I should've left a note
or something.

I just... got really scared.

Where are you?

Uh, Texas. I think.
Is Tanya okay?

Yeah, yeah,
she's... she's fine.

But, um, it's just Charlie.
He's freaking out.

He thinks that you might
rat us out to the cops.

Would I have left Tanya if I was
gonna do that? Come on.

No, no, that's... that's
exactly what I told him.

It's just...
[Gunshot in distance]

MAN: Yeah! Whoo!

It's just, you better
come back quick.

It's getting crazy around here.

What do you mean?
I-I can't talk.

Squeaky, make sure Tanya's...
[Line disconnects]

[Dial tone]

[Receiver banging]

[Cries and sniffles]

I'm starving.

Do you know what I would do
for a cheeseburger right now?

Oh! And French fries.

Mmm. Strawberry ice cream,

On a sugar cone.

[Women screaming]

LESLIE: What are you doing?

Bet you're not thinking about
food now, are ya?

Hey, girls.

It's time to pay the bills.

[Women giggle]

Go with 'em.

It'll be fun.

LINDA: Living on love
didn't bring food or money,

So we hustled.

*

That's your lifeline
right there.

See?

Branches all the way
to the bottom.

That's good.

So I'll live to see
another day?

Mm-hmm.

There's other ones, too.

They tell you
all sorts of things.

Oh, yeah?

Like what?


Which car?

Oh, crap! Uh...

The Lincoln! The Lincoln!
Quick! He's taking a piss!


[Car door slams,
engine starts]

Whoo!
Whoo!

Yeah! We're still grooving!
We did it!

Aah!
How did you do that?

[Laughter, screaming]

Okay!

Whoo! [Laughs]

Aah! [Laughs]

[Garbage rustling]

I can't believe they would
throw this out.

It's not even opened.

SUSAN: Charlie calls them
the "haves."

People who have too much
and waste it.

We're supposed
to take it back.

Aah! [Giggles]

Table for two, please.

Right this way.
Smoking or non-smoking?

ALL: * Hand in hand
and arm in arm *

* We go our separate ways

* With our eyes
we say goodbye *

* Our hearts will
stay the same *

* Time is nothing,
love is free *

* Life is living,
can't you see? *

* Hand in hand
and arm in arm *

* We go our separate ways

* Hand in hand, we all...

TEX: [Clears throat]
Here you go.

Look inside, okay?

MAN: Yeah. Cool.

All right.

Why don't we, uh...

Why don't
we sweeten the pot here?

Looks like someone's about
to be initiated.

CHARLIE: Hey, Sarah.

Come over here for a second.

SARAH: Hi, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Hey, girl.


Listen, um,
that's my friend Andy.

So why don't you take him
on over to the bunkhouse?

Uh, I, um...

But I love you.

Well, this is how
you show your love.

Charlie, couldn't I just...

Hey, hey.

You're free to do
what you want.

Everybody here is.

Right?
Mm-hmm.

So if you wanna leave,
I'll still love you.

No, I don't...
Charlie, I don't wanna leave.

If you wanna stay
and be a part of this family,

You gotta pitch in.

It's your choice.

All right?
[Mouths word]


*

*

[Birds chirping]

[Door bangs]

[Latches click]


This right here, boys...

Is the beginning
of Helter Skelter.

If you're talking
Armageddon...

a lot more guns than this.

Don't worry, Tex.

I got it covered.

[Gun clatters]

*

Let's go to bed.
[Door creaks]

It's time to cut
the apron strings.

The kids sleep here.

Charlie says we're
too possessive of our children.

Everyone here is her mother,
her father.

And that's what the family's
all about.

This is what's best for her.

There's a reason for everything,
Linda.

You have to trust us.

SUSAN: Do you?

We're not gonna make the same
mistakes our parents made,

Are we?

No.


No.


Say good night.

LINDA: Night, baby.

[Patricia chuckles]

You'll get used to it.

I promise.

I felt the same way
when I first got here.

It's time to get dressed.

Why?
Right on.

Creepy crawler time!

What is that?

Come with us,
and you'll see. [Giggles]

[Creedence Clearwater Revival's
"I Put a Spell on You" playing]

Whoo! [Squeals]

Okay, is Charlie really making
an album with Dennis Wilson?

Yeah, he's gonna be bigger
than the Beatles.


Okay, well, maybe not
the Beatles...

but famous.

Hey, pass them back.
I've already taken three.


Keeps your energy up.

Steal whatever you can find...
Watches, wallets, jewelry.

Oh, but before we go, we mess
with their little piggie heads.

How do you know
no one's home?

We don't.

That's what makes it fun.

* I ain't gonna take
none of your *

* Puttin' me down

* I put a spell on you

* Because you're mine

* All right

*

[Monitor beeping steadily]


Oh! This is even better
than last week.


What'd you get, Linda?

Um, I know we said
take everything...
Open it!

Far out!

It's where my mother keeps
her jewelry.


LESLIE: Charlie'll love that.

[Laughter continues]

You will follow me
into the desert,

Into the bottomless pit,

Until the Angel of Death passes

And Helter Skelter is over!

[The Seeds' "Can't Seem
to Make You Mine" playing]

* I can't seem
to make you mine *

LINDA: We were wasted
all the time.

Mescaline, mushrooms, speed.

It made the crazy stuff
start to seem normal.

Everything becomes normal
when it's all you know.

I feel dizzy.

Drink some water.

Sarah, can you breathe?

SQUEAKY: I think she O.D.'d.

TEX: Hey,
she's gettin' pale, man.
CHARLIE: Just move. Get back!

Is she breathing?
Is she gonna die?

Shut up!

[Whispering indistinctly]

[Indistinct whispering
continues]

[Breathing heavily]
MAN: Far out.

She'll be all right now.

LINDA: In our eyes,

Charlie could perform miracles.

Charlie was magical...

A god.

LESLIE: I love you, Charlie.

I love you.

*

LINDA: People came to the ranch
all the time.

Gary Hinman was Bobby's friend,
a local music teacher.

Charlie said he was going to
use him on his record.

Gary!

Welcome.

Thank you. This place is...
pretty special.

Uh-huh.

Would you like to join us
in saying grace?

Yeah, you bet, Charlie.

Life is God.

Birds. Bugs. Trees.

The sun.

Some people,
they got God up on a cross.

And they're all kneeling down,
hoping that when they die,

They're gonna go to
a better place.

But guess what? Death...

It doesn't exist. [Laughs]

It's life, baby.
That's the truth.

And how do I know?
Because I...

I'm a messenger of truth.

And you all you here...

You're my church.

Amen?

WOMAN: Mm.

Amen, brother. Let's eat.


Whew!
[Charlie laughs]

So, Gary, so you been listening
to "The White Album"?

Yeah, I heard it.

Those boys from Liverpool
are geniuses,

Talking about how
there's gonna be a race war.

A race war?

Well, look at
the Watts Riots, Gary.

I mean, we gotta be prepared.

It's all there.
It's in "Helter Skeltter."

Really? I-I didn't get that.

[Utensils clinking]

"You say you want
a revolution"?

Uh-huh.
I do, man!

And you better believe
happiness comes from a warm gun.

I mean, don't you watch
the news, read the papers?

The... the blacks are...
Are pissed off,

And... and it's all gonna
go down real soon.

Do you... do you think
you're special, Bobby?

No, man.

[Chuckles nervously]

Not at all.
W-Why... why you ask?

You're taking more than
your share of peas.


We are all equals here,

But apparently, one of
our family members thinks

That he's the prime minister
and president

Of all the world's peas!
[Slams table]

I don't even like peas,
so, Bobby, you can have mine.

No, no, that's not the point!

[Spoon scrapes plate]

GARY: It's okay, Bobby.
It's fine.

Sorry, Charlie.

Just feel your remorse, son,
and let it go.

You'll make it up
to me later.

So, Gary, I heard that your pop
recently passed away.

I'm so sorry to hear that, man.

Gonna fly with the...
The angels, right?

Thanks, Charlie.

Did he leave you any money?

*

[Engine rumbling]

[Engine stops]

Terry.

[Car door closes]

Good to see you.
Good to see you.

How you doing?

So listen...
[Clears throat]

Columbia is gonna
respectfully pass.

There's no record deal.
I'm sorry.

CHARLIE: No, man, that's bull!
Terry's out there.

Even though I spoke to the label
several times, Charlie.

And I'm sorry,
but they're just not interested.

But you... you said
they were interested!

You said my music was better
than Dylan's!

I don't think I ever
said that.

You calling me a liar?

No, man. No.

No, but getting a record deal,
it's not...

It's not easy.

I told you
it was a long shot.

You promised me.

Bad things happen to people
who break promises.

Whoa...

Is that some kind
of a threat?

Threat?

It is what it is.

[Cocks gun]

Jesus.

Charlie...

Should we go?
No. No, wait.

Charlie...

Get off my ranch...

Pig.

[Engine starts]

*

*

Hey, man.
We don't need Melcher.

We can get our own deal.

Find a new label.

You think so?

Yeah.

What do you think, Tex? You
think we could find a new label?
[Trunk creaks]

Charlie, I think it's anything
you put your mind to.

You guys...


You're so smart.

You're so... goddamn smart.

Maybe you should run
this family.

No way, man.
Not without you, Charlie.

No?

Well, then show me
what you can do!

Goddamn it!
Enough of this talk!

Talk! Talk!

Do something, damn it!
Do something!

I'm sick of this talk! Talk!
We can make our own record,
right?

What did you say?

Man, I said,
we can make our own record.

[Crowbar thuds]

Our own record.

That's it!
That's it, man!

Yeah!

Whoo! You know it!
You know it!

[Laughing, whooping]

We're gonna make our own record!
[Women laugh]

And when it goes gold,

They're gonna be begging me
to record for 'em!

Whoo!
That's it! That's it!

Yeah!
Whoo!

Whoo-hoo!

Whoo!
Yeah!

Yeah!
Whoo!

Whoo!
Whoo! Hoo-hoo!

*

MAN: 30 seconds...
[speaks indistinctly]

[Radio static]

Contact right.
Okay, engine stop.

Tranquility Base here.

This is so cool.
The Eagle has landed.

Nobody's ever been
there before.

Like, your footprints are...
Are the only ones there.

That's crazy.

Very, very fine grain
as you get close to it.

It's almost like a powder.

The moon walk's a fake.

It is?

It's a government P.R. stunt.

Make the country forget
about poverty and Vietnam

When what they ought to be doing
is preparing for Helter Skelter.

Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Blackie's revolt against
the white man.

And if Blackie don't start
the revolution himself,

We're gonna start it
for him, right?

Yeah.
Uh-huh.

Right on.

ARMSTRONG: That's one
small step for man...

'Cause you're my soldiers.

One giant leap...
[TV turns off]

All of you.

[Object thuds]

Unless you don't believe it.

Go to the wall, stand there.

Give me your knife.

But I do believe, Charlie.
I do.

[Breathing heavily]


If you're gonna make others
bleed for the cause,

You gotta be able
to bleed yourself.

You think I got good aim?

You better pray I do.

I believe! Charlie!



[Inhales sharply]

[Continues crying]

I...

[Gasps sharply,
exhales]


[Breathing heavily]

I see that you do.

And I forgive you.

Thank you.
Uh-huh.


You're welcome.

[Exhales sharply]
Come here.


*

* It's a beautiful life,
so let it be *

* Just believe what you see

*

* Don't recall your sorrow,
darlin' *

* Everything you want
is callin' *

* I'm callin' your name

*

* Break through the chains
that tie you down *

* Forsake the circus
and the clowns *

* I'm calling your name

*

* Your soul is see-through

* I'm looking into you

* Look into me

* Look at you

*

* Inside your mind,
you toss and turn *

* I don't know
why you got to hurt *

* When it's calling your name

When'd you learn my song?

Uh, past week.

I wanted to surprise you.

You got a real good voice,
Susan. I always thought so.

Thank you. [Laughs]

Maybe you should get a record
contract with Dennis Wilson.

No, Charlie, I couldn't do that.
You wrote this song.

That's why you're gonna be
so famous.

Oh, yeah? So... so I can write
songs, but I can't sing 'em?

No, that's not what I meant.
[Chuckles softly]

You have a great voice.


Relax, girls,
I'm just messing with you.

[Tex and Charlie chuckle]

So where are we on that Ford?

You got that thing up
and running yet?

Yeah, just two things.
The subframe needs to be fixed.

And, uh...
plus the engine needs...

[Guitar thuds]

*

[Children crying]

What's the matter?
Why are they crying?

They're fine.
I mean, they're okay.

They haven't had breakfast.

It's almost noon. Why not?

'Cause we're low on food.
I'm trying to ration it out.

Does Charlie know?

He's too freaked about
his record deal.

And we're also out of money.
They've gotta eat.

I know, okay?

I'll handle it.

[Door closes]

[Birds chirping]

[Air hissing]

*

Hey there.

Um, just got a flat...
[Clears throat]

Right out
in front of your place.

Could you give me
a little hand?

I'm not so good
with tire stuff.

Or car stuff.

Well, yeah, sure. Yeah.
[Clears throat]

Let me just, uh...
I'll grab my... stuff.

You live in Topanga?

Oh, no, I'm just headed down
to the beach.

Hey, when you're done with this,
why don't you come?

Yeah, sounds good.
I'll, uh, grab some beers.

LINDA: I heard Bob was back
from South America

And had made a big score.

I thought maybe this would help.

I mean, it had to.


There you go.

Mind if I, uh, go wash up a bit
before we head down there?

Oh, get you all
hot and bothered, did I?

I'll be right back.

[Tools clattering]

*

*

Come on! Get in!


I got it! Whoo!
Aah!

Here we go! Whoo!

Whoo!

It's about $5,000.

This girl.

She came to us
only a few weeks ago,

But her generosity...

And loyalty...

See, this is
what I'm talking about.

This is what family
really means.

She deserves our gratitude.

Thank you, Linda.

Thank you, Linda.

We love you.

[Vehicle approaching]

That's Bob.
He must have followed us.

Everybody inside now.

[Engine stops]

Linda!

What's going on, man?

Where's Linda?
I said get her.

She took my money!

What money?

Panhandling must be
pretty good.

Oh, you Manson?

You must be the man
who abandoned our lovely Linda.

Cough it up now,
or I'm calling the cops.

Whoa. Hey, hey.

There's no need for
the pigs, man.

We got your money,
and you can have it.

But you gotta kill me first.

Hey, stick it in.

Man, the money's yours.

Come on.

You got what it takes, Bob?

You got what it takes
to kill a man?

You're crazy.

I never tried to be
anything else.

So come on.
Twist and turn, baby!

You people are
out of your minds.

You can keep the money.

And Linda!

She's one of us.
She's not yours to give.

[Engine starts, revving]

Ugh!

I know. My butt is
sticking to the seat.


Who is that guy?

They call him Lotsapopsa.

Charlie has to make a big score
before Helter Skelter.

So we'll be ready to go
to the desert

When it all goes down.

When will that happen?

Soon.

Charlie says we're gonna go
to Death Valley.

It's funny that
they call it that.

Isn't it?

'Cause it's gonna give us
life.

*

[Electric Banana's "A Thousand
Ages from the Sun" playing]

* As you smile at me

* A thousand ages from the sun

* Since our time's begun

[Door closes in distance]

Oh, hi.

It's okay.

*

* Today is spent in grace

* And the clouds,
they spin and turn *

* It's your universe

* You could turn the world
upside down *

* Change the colors everywhere

[Door creaks]
[Breathing heavily]

What is it?

Um, Charlie just killed someone.

LINDA: That night,
everything changed.

But Lotsapopsa?

Yeah, well, he thought Charlie
and Tex burned him.

He started choking Charlie.

Then Charlie shot him
in the gut.

It was self-defense.
Charlie had no choice.

What if the cops come
for Charlie? Come for us?

Well, we cover for him.

We tell the cops that
Charlie was here. We...

No, there were no witnesses.

We were gone before
he bled out.

Then everything's okay.

No! It isn't.

It's not the cops
we have to worry about.

It's the Panthers.
Panthers?

Lotsapopsa was one of 'em.

[Breathing heavily]

[Wind blowing]

[Fire crackling]

Armageddon is here.

Don't ask why,
don't be frightened.

Pain isn't a bad thing.

It's good.
It teaches us things.

Now trust in me.

As I've trusted in you.

The black man is
gonna be on top.

And it's comin' soon.

And the black man
is gonna win

'Cause he's got nothing to lose.

They're gonna need
someone to lead them

Through the desert.

A Moses.

That's you!
That's you, Charlie!

A Moses with a vision.

Yeah!
Yes!

A Moses to lead them
to the promised land!

ALL: Yeah!

Now I want all of you
to get up and dance

Like it's your last day
on Earth!

Like it's your last night
to dance with freedom!

My soldiers! My family!

ALL: Yeah!
That's right!


*

WOMAN: * Ooh, ooh, ooh

* Ooh, ooh, ooh


LINDA:
It was a rush, a calling.

We thought we were eternal.

CHARLIE: I would kill for you.
Would you kill for me?

ALL: Yes, Charlie.
WOMAN: Yes.

CHARLIE:
Would you die for me?

ALL: Yes!

[Drums pounding]


LINDA:
I've never seen so many guns.

Charlie must've gotten more.

A lot more.

[Gunshots continue]
Whoo!

That's how you do it, Bobby!

Okay, if you wanna stab,

What you wanna do is aim
for this gut here.

Once you're in, turn.

CHARLIE: Time doesn't exist.
Life doesn't exist.

It's all the same thing,
baby! It's all the same!

Everything's the same!
[Women giggle]

You are perfect.
You are perfect.

You are perfect.

[Imitates gunshot]


What was it like?
When Charlie killed Lotsapopsa?

One minute,
he was yelling about his money,

Next minute,
he's lying on the floor.

I thought he grabbed Charlie.

Yeah, he did, sorta. Yes.

Who cares?

How much blood was there?
What was it like?

Was it like a big pool of red?
Yeah, there was.

If the Panthers are coming,

Why don't we just take the kids
and go to the desert?

Are you questioning Charlie?

I don't think she was.
I'm not talking to you.

I'm just thinking
about Tanya.

I've got a kid, too, remember?

You don't see me
wanting to leave.

[Imitates gunshot]

I'll give 'em this.

They know the power of an image.

See, that says strength.

It says, "don't mess with me."

The cop piggies,
political piggies,

The Panther piggies.

They're all gonna burn
when Helter Skelter comes.

If there's one thing
I learned in prison,

Is that when the odds
are against you,

Your best weapon is
the element of surprise.

[Gasps, breathing heavily]

Now one little move,

And I'm holding her head
in my hand.

That's how you kill
in close quarters.

No muss, no fuss.

Now if your enemy's
coming at you...

[Gasps, breathing heavily]

Charlie!

I don't... uh...



Hmm. [Sniffs]

Hey, hey.

I do the thinking.

Now you gotta prove
yourself to me.

*

Come here, baby.

Come here.

Come on, man, we're brothers.

When one brother's in need,

The other one's
gotta come through.

I don't have any money.
Aah!

You said your old man
left you some.

It's already gone.

I spent it. I bought...
I bought a car.

I had bills to pay.

You expect me to believe that?

I'm telling you, Charlie.


[Blade zings]


We got a war to fight, man.

What war?

Now if they're gonna come
after us...

They're gonna
come after you, too.

Who's gonna come after me,
Charlie? Oh, God!

Ah!

Bobby! Oh, God.


Help me, man!

Take care of him.

Charlie.


You guys, just leave.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

You know me.
Don't believe him.

I swear to God.
He's gonna blackmail Charlie.

No, I won't.
Don't. He's lying.

Bobby, you know me.
We're...


[Gasping and choking]

[Gasping and grunting]

[Grunting stops]

The Panthers.

They'll think
it's the Panthers.

It's gonna be cool, man.

What if they don't blame it
on the Panthers?

It was just some scribbling
on a wall.

Bobby, take these.
I'm looking at the gas...

Hey!

Just ditch the car,

Go up north, and lay low.

The cops will find him
in a couple of days

And they'll go after
the Panthers.

Then you can come back.

Were you way freaked?

Hey, whatever's necessary to do,
you do it.

Watching him
struggling to breathe,

And then helping him die...

It was amazing.

LINDA: They were constantly
searching the news

For anything
about Hinman's murder

And how it connected
to the Panthers.

Bobby got arrested.

Are you sure?
How do you know?

He was, uh, sleeping by
the side of the road.

Cops came along, ran the plates.

What? It's illegal to sleep
in your car now?

It was Gary's car?
It was what?

And the knife he used.
They think it was in there.

That'll ruin us.

We still have to help him.

He goes down, we all do.

Linda!
Yes!

Are you gonna join
the conversation?

We have to tell Charlie.
Charlie's not here right now.

What do you mean
he's not here?

Charlie drove to
the Bay Area last night.

What if the cops come?

If Bobby rats us out.
Well, what about the kids?

He wouldn't do that.
How do you know that?

I'll take care of it,
all right?

We'll wait till
Charlie gets here.

*

[Knock on door]

Mom?


You wanna...
wanna talk about it?

Well, you must be hungry.

How about if I make you
some mac and cheese, huh?

You love mac and cheese.

Come on, sweetheart, I want you
to sit down right there.

You know what? I think
I've got a Fanta in the garage.

You want one?

Where's the phone?

Honey, you know where
the phone is.

It's in the kitchen.

[Rotary dial clacking]

[Phone rings]
Hello?

Leslie, it's me.
It's Linda.

Give me.
The police raided us!

You should've seen it.

They were just crawling
all over the place.

Well, what about the kids?
Is Tanya okay?

But get this,
the cops had no idea.

They arrested us on
grand theft auto charges,

But they had to let us go
for insufficient evidence.

Where is Tanya?
Well, you left, remember?

The Malibu police took her.

Hello? Linda?

[Receiver thuds]

Who's Tanya?


Mm. We could bust Bobby out.
With what, Patty? A tank?

What good would that do?
Okay, okay.
Sorry for thinking.

I just talked to Charlie's
friends in San Francisco,

And nobody's seen him.

Well, then what do we do?
Everybody just shut up!

I left those prints
on Gary's wall

So that the cops would think
it was the Panthers.

Yeah, but they already
arrested Bobby.

Yeah,
'cause Bobby's an idiot.

Ugh.

Um...

What if...
someone else gets killed?

And the paw prints get left
on their wall?

The pigs see that,
they'll have to let Bobby out.

They'll... they'll...
They'll know that it wasn't him.

You mean kill again?

Yeah. To save Bobby and Charlie
and the whole family.

And who would we go after?

Does it matter?

LINDA: We were lost.

Terrified.

With Charlie gone,
it got even worse.

Okay, baby.

You can sleep when
we're in the car.

[Door opens]

You're leaving us?

I have to.

You understand, don't you?

Why don't you take him
and come with me

Before this gets worse?

He belongs here...

Like I do.

That old lady?

At the house?
She reminded me of my mother.

She died of cancer
when I was 16.

That's awful. I'm sorry.

I held her.

Just a tiny, little thing
like a wounded bird

Waiting to die.

The day my mother died,

Light went out of my life.

And then I met Charlie.

Because of Charlie,
I met you.

Light came back on.

And now
it's going out again.

Was I that light for you?

More than the other girls?

[Voice breaks] How did
the world get so crazy?

Okay, sweetheart.

Go back to sleep now. Okay?

*

[Horn honking]

[Engine stops]

[Car door closes]

I had to get away
for a little while

To clear my head, but back now.
So we can keep going.

What's up?

I asked you a question.

[Clears throat] They arrested
Bobby for Hinman.

He's gonna rat us out.

I should've known
not to trust him.

Charlie, please don't freak.
Don't freak?!

Oh, no! You better freak,
little girl!

What if we kill someone else?

Leave the same prints,
same everything.

Then they'll have to let
Bobby go, right?

Who came up with that?

You?

We all did.

It was all of us.

Maybe it's not a good idea.
We would...
No, it's not a good idea.

It's far out, man.


[Continues laughing]

Helter Skelter
starts tonight.


*

Linda.
Is your license still good?

Yeah.

Then you're driving.

There's a house
in Beverly Hills.

It's Terry Melcher's old place.
The one on Cielo Drive.

Oh, I know that place.
I've been there.

Who lives there now?

Don't matter.
They're rich pigs.

It's just gonna be you,
Tex.

Oh, man. It's on?

It's on.



Now you do what Tex says,
you got it?

And leave a sign.
Something witchy.

[Engine starts]

*

LINDA: I wanted to drive
to the beach.

I wanted to get stoned
and lay on the sand

And start all over,
all of us together.

I kept hoping my friends would
wake up from this nightmare.

But they didn't.

We didn't.

ALL: * Hand in hand
and arm in arm *

* We go our separate ways

* With our eyes we say goodbye,
our hearts will stay the same *

* 'Cause time is nothing,
love is free *

* Life is living,
can't you see? *

* Hand in hand and arm in arm,
we go our separate ways *

* Hand in hand...

[Singing indistinctly]

*


Hey, man. Uhh!

This is gonna be good.

Hey, just wait here, okay?
Be lookout.
[Dog barking in distance]

Let's go!


[Crickets chirping]

[Gate clanks]

*

[Woman screams
and shouts indistinctly]

[Object clatters]

MAN: No, stop! Aah!

Stop, please! Stop!

Aah! Please!
Aah!


[Screaming and grunting]

[Shouting indistinctly
and crying]

[Shouting indistinctly]

[Engine sputtering]

[Engine sputtering]

Move, move, move.

[Screaming, cheering]

[Shouting indistinctly,
cheering continues]

Charlie's gonna be so hurt!

Oh, oh! I threw the whole round
in that guy. [Laughs]

They squealed like a pig, man!

[Laughter and screaming]

Toss it, toss it!

Oh, all right! I'll toss 'em.

Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yes!

[Whooping and laughing]

Thank you, lady!
Thank you, thank you!

Friday night in Los Angeles,

A movie actress and four of
her friends were murdered.

And the circumstances
were lurid.

The movie actress was
Sharon Tate, 26.

That was Sharon Tate?
The actress?

Sharon Tate,
you hear that, Charlie?

We're gonna be famous.

REPORTER: The police
searched the premises.

They was no evidence
of robbery.

No suggestion of motive,
and there are no suspects

At this time.

I wanted suspects.
That was the whole point.

How else are
we gonna get Bobby out?

You remembered to put the paw
prints on the wall, right?

To blame it on the Panthers?

Um...

It all happened so quickly,
Charlie.

You idiots.

If you want something done
right, you gotta do it yourself.

Tonight. No mistakes.

And this time...

There will be blood
on these hands.

Charlie, I...

Please don't make me.

Let me do it.

You said one day
I could prove myself.

*

LINDA: We didn't know
where we were going.

Charlie was just
looking for someone to kill.

In one of those houses,

There were people who would be
dead in a few minutes,

And they had no idea.

[Sighs and sniffles]

[Engine turns off]

REPORTER: what seems like
an odd, religious life.

Five persons including
actress Sharon Tate

Were found dead at the home
of Ms. Tate and her husband,

Director Roman Polanski.

Ms. Tate, who starred in
"Valley of the Dolls,"

Was eight months pregnant

And was found in a nightgown
with a rope around her neck.
Hi.

Who the hell are you?
Reports are the other end
was attached the body...

What do you want?
Please leave.

The door was open.
You shouldn't do that,

Not in this day and age.

[TV turns off]
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

You're the guy
who killed those people.

I'm not a killer, man.

I just want money.

See, we're all brothers
in this world.

We're all connected and we all
help each other out.


So what do you think?
Can you help out a brother?


I've got some money
in the den.

Well, that's good.

You can have it all.



Who else is here?

My wife. She's asleep.

You're gonna be okay.
I promise.

Please don't hurt her.
Please.


Give me your gun, Tex.
Wait, why?

'Cause no guns.

Do it right this time.

[Car door opens]

[Car door closes]


[Lighter clicks]


Don't feel bad for 'em.
Dying's easy.

It's livin' that's scary.

Let's go.

Without them?

They'll find their way back.

[Engine starts]

"The LaBiancas were found
with their wrists bound

"Behind their back.

Multiple stab wounds were
inflicted on their upper torso."

I left a fork in his stomach.
Sticking right out of him.


Oh, "The savagery of the crime
has drawn an eerie comparison"

"Of the killing of Sharon Tate
and her housemates

"On the evening of August 8th.

"The LAPD homicide detectives
reject any notion that

The two events are,
in fact, related."

in blood on the wall.

What more do we have to do?
Well, I made a list.

Paul Newman, Liz Taylor.

Sandy Koufax.
Who?

Sandy Koufax.
He pitches for the Dodgers.

Mm, Sinatra, Walt Disney.

Maybe even Elvis
when he comes back into town.


We're gonna kill them all.


LINDA: When I returned to LA,
I was afraid they would find me.

But I had to take the risk to
get Tanya back.

Tanya. Hey, baby.
Sweetheart.

We were less than 10 miles
from Spahn Ranch...

10 miles closer than
I ever wanted to be again.

But having Tanya with me
was a miracle.

The only good thing I had left.


*

[Sea birds calling]


No!


Get up. You need to see this.
They're under arrest.

Manson and the others.
What?

They changed them with
seven counts of murder.

The wandering band of members
of a so-called religious cult

Has had three of its followers
arrested in the investigation

Of the murder of Sharon Tate
and six others.

And the Los Angeles police
said they would ask

Murder indictments
against several others...

[Telephone rings]
Don't answer it.

Why not?
It could be them.

Who?
The family.

Honey, they're in jail.

They're everywhere, Mom.
You don't understand.

Police said they were
a pseudo religious cult

Who call themselves
"the Family."

People who worked on the ranch

Said they were
heavy drug users.

Tanya's asleep in my room.

Where are you going?

You heard what they said.
Possibility of other arrests.

Well, no one mentioned
your name.
What if they do?

What if Charlie
or one of the girls

Tells them what I did?
You didn't kill anyone.

So what? I drove the car.
I watched them.

I watched them do it
and I never tried to stop them.

I still don't understand,

How they made you do
something do horrible.

They didn't make me.

No one did.

Be a really good girl
for grandma, okay?

I'll be back soon.

I love you.

LINDA: I knew what we did
was wrong.

I needed to make it right
by telling the truth.

My daughter shouldn't be
a fugitive for something

She had nothing to do with.

I was there. I saw it happen.

I drove the car,
and I did nothing to stop them.

[Camera shutters clicking]

I'll do whatever you feel
is necessary.


Help me make some sense
of this, Linda.

God knows I can't.

I think you're asking
the wrong person.

Oh, no. I'm pretty certain
I'm asking the right person.

Here's an ex-con,
a little nobody.

How does a guy like that
get all of you

To do his bidding?

Have you ever felt like
a nobody?

Sure. I mean, I suppose.

I don't think
that you have.

I don't think you've ever
wondered if anyone

Would really care if
you just... disappeared.

What if someone finally
made you feel like you mattered?

[Voice breaks]
Wouldn't you want that?

Not enough to kill for it.

Sometimes the only thing
that makes sense is no sense.

WOMEN: * ...we always are,
I'll see you soon again *

* Time is nothing,
love is free *

* Life is living,
can't you see? *

* Hand in hand and arm in arm,
we go our separate ways *

* Hand in hand we always are,
I'll see you soon again *

Oh, Linda.

We are everywhere.

[Camera shutter clicks]


* Time is nothing,
love is free *

* Life is living,
can't you see? *

* Hand in hand and arm in arm
we go our separate ways *

* Hand in hand we always are,
I'll see you soon again *

* Hand in hand we always are,
I'll see you soon again *

*
