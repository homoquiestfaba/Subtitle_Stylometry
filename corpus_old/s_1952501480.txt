(MACHINE GUN FIRING)

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>(SINGING) I have crossed
the mystic desert</i>

<i>To snap pictures
of the poor</i>

<i>I've invited them
to brunch</i>

<i>Let them crash out
on my floor</i>

<i>There's sunshine
in my veins</i>

<i>My kitchen's
filled with flies</i>

<i>I'm crying out in vain</i>

<i>Like a little African child</i>

<i>Trapped in me</i>

<i>There's a little
African child trapped in me</i>


<i>All of these blowjobs
in limousines</i>

<i>Why do they matter,
what do they mean</i>


<i>To the little
African child trapped in me?</i>

<i>This is Zoe Salmon,
and I'm on the set</i>

<i>of international
rock star Aldous Snow's</i>

<i>new music video,
African Child.</i>

I was watching
the news one day

and I saw footage
about, well,

a war in I think
it was Darfur

or Zimbabwe or Rwanda,
one of them.

<i>And I just thought,
"This isn't right, is it?"</i>

<i>And I made some phone calls.
It turns out, it isn't.</i>

<i>ZOE: Aldous' longtime
girlfriend and mother of
their son, Naples,</i>

<i>model pop star Jackie Q.</i>

<i>He's really passionate.</i>

<i>He's never been to Africa,
but he's really
passionate about it.</i>

And about, like,
potentially going there.

When they were
putting together
this costume, I said,

<i>"Imagine an African,
white Christ from space."</i>

And this is what
they came back with,

an African,
white space Christ.

<i>That's how it...
Well, that's just
the concept, you know.</i>

<i>Obviously, I'm not saying
I'm an African,
white space Christ.</i>

<i>That would be...
That's not for me to say.
That's for other people...</i>

<i>That's for
other people to say
if they think I'm...</i>

<i>They think
I'm like Jesus.</i>

<i>(SINGING) Ride me inside me
supertight</i>

<i>Boom boom
Shake the room
like it's dynamite</i>

<i>Ride me inside me
supertight</i>

<i>Boom boom
Shake the room
like it's dynamite</i>

<i>Ride me inside me
supertight</i>

<i>Boom boom
Shake the room
like it's dynamite</i>

<i>ZOE: Jackie, you've had
multiple hit singles,
an amazing modeling career,</i>

<i>and your very
own perfume line.</i>

<i>How do you find balance
with your family life?</i>

<i>JACKIE: Naples is a darling.</i>

Really cool!

<i>JACKIE: He's so gorgeous.</i>

<i>And Aldy's the best father.</i>

What do you love
most about Aldous?

I just love his
energy and insight.

The way he says
my name and...

Jackie.

<i>Oh, don't.</i>

<i>You have a huge
album coming out right
now, African Child.</i>

Everyone is so
excited about it.
You must be, too.

When people look back
at musical history,

<i>they'll say,
"Sergeant Pepper,
African Child. "</i>

<i>That's what
they'll probably say.</i>

<i>(SINGING)
Trapped in me</i>

(SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

<i>Jackie, Aldous,
welcome back to
Showbiz Tonight.</i>

Great to see you!
How are things going,
Aldous?

Fantastically.
To tell you the
truth, Brooke.

<i>I'm happy in a way
I didn't think was
truly possible for me.</i>

Great. And you, Jackie?

<i>I'm actually
a bit bored,
you know.</i>

<i>We've been sober now
seven years together.</i>

<i>And it's been a real
adjustment for me,</i>

you know,
the difference
in lifestyle.

You know,
he works out all day

getting every part of
his body really hard.

<i>Except one part's missing,
you know? One part.</i>

I think that
through all that...
Jackie. Have you
been drinking today?

<i>I've had a few
fucking drinks, yeah.
Just a few drinks.</i>

Yeah.
But that...
You know, whatever.

<i>You know, arrest me.
But it's really boring.
Jackie. Jackie.</i>

The old Aldous would have,
you know, had his way
with you.

<i>Would've bent you over
that pretty little chair
and had his way.</i>

<i>And now we'd be
having a three-way.</i>

<i>You'd be coming over
for a cognac later,
I'll tell you that, sweetie.</i>

<i>But that's not
happening anymore.</i>

<i>Do you want me
to start drinking again?
Is that what you'd like?</i>

Do you want to
return to that?
Maybe you should.

<i>I'll do lines
off her forehead</i>

<i>while I'm in her
up to my nuts.</i>

<i>If that's what you want.
I'm just saying.</i>

<i>Tell you what,
time to invest
in Jack Daniel's,</i>

<i>'cause Aldous Snow
is off the wagon.</i>

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Drinking gin
at half past 5:00</i>

<i>Chatting up the bird
with the dodgy eye</i>

<i>I vomit Jäger
on her pasty thighs</i>

<i>Do a runner
when her fella arrives</i>

<i>Drop the pills,
I'm off me crust</i>

<i>Meet the lads,
I'm coming up</i>

<i>The misbehaving
singer appeared on
MTV News this weekend</i>

to leak some
exciting info.

<i>Let's get fucked,
let's get fucked</i>

<i>Let's get fucked up
on the town</i>


<i>Let's get fucked,
let's get fucked</i>

<i>Let's get fucked up
on the town</i>

<i>MAN: Aldous Snow's
father and former manager,
Jonathan Snow,</i>

<i>has written
a tell-all book.</i>

<i>Well, I managed Aldous
for the first two
years of his career.</i>

<i>Yeah, he managed me
while I was in his testicles.</i>

<i>The minute he ejaculated,
the management ended.</i>

(REPORTERS SHOUTING)

<i>No, I don't fucking miss it!
I'll show you what it's like.</i>

<i>Yeah, you're watching
Aldous Snow on TMZ!</i>


<i>Let's get fucked,

Let's have fun up on the town</i>

Let's have fun up on the town</i>

<i>Called a cab, back to mine
Same routine every time</i>

<i>Okay, I'm up. I'm up!
(MUSIC STOPS)</i>

Hey, Daph, how was work?

<i>I can't talk.
Too tired.</i>

Is that blood
on your scrubs?

Probably.

<i>This guy's heart
just went, like...</i>

<i>It was like
something out of Saw.</i>

You want me to
get you an Ambien?

Oh, God, no. I have to
be back there at noon.

At noon?
Mmm-hmm.

<i>That sucks, babe,
I'm sorry.</i>

<i>It's okay, sweetie.
It's not your fault.</i>

Okay.

What do you want?
Whale, wave or
mountain stream?

DAPHNE: All of them.
Really loud.

There you go.
(WHALE SOUNDS ON RADIO)

Thank you, sweetie,
I love you.

<i>You're welcome.</i>

I got you an eggy thingy.

<i>I took a bite out of it
and it's kind of cold,
but it's still good.</i>

<i>Thank you.
You're welcome.</i>

You want to tape
ourselves having sex

for two hours
before I go to work?

<i>You're so funny.
I love you.</i>

No? Are you sure?

<i>I've always wanted to
have sex with the Lone
Ranger I the Hamburglar.</i>

<i>No, I'll see you tonight.</i>

Okay. Have a good day.

I love you, Aaron,
so much.

<i>Good night.
You're funny.</i>

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Oi! I'm a love dealer
You want to score</i>

<i>I'll give you my number
So give me a call</i>

<i>You're looking so Ionely
There's no need to be</i>

<i>Let me introduce
you to my family</i>

<i>What's up?
How's it going?</i>

<i>What's up, man?
I went to that Jay-Z
listening party last night.</i>

Was it crazy?
Was it insane?
Was the album incredible?

<i>I don't know.
I got there late.</i>

But there was this
sweet after-after-party

<i>back at Jay-Z's house.
It was insane.</i>

<i>I ate cheese off
some girl's titties.</i>

<i>Just lie to me
and tell me it wasn't
the best night of all time.</i>

Yeah, it was, man.
That party was dope.

<i>Yeah. Dude,
I used Jay-Z's bidet.</i>

Yeah. We went into
their bathroom.

Jay-Z and Beyoncé
have these two bidets
right next to each other,

so they can sit
there and hold hands

<i>while they get their
bungus's cleaned out.</i>

<i>You used Jay-Z and
Beyoncé's matching
his and hers bidets?</i>

<i>Jigga Man's bidet.</i>

Did you hear?
Killtown Records just fired
80% of their employees.

<i>So what? I'm safe.
I'm safe.</i>

<i>I'm in the jazz game.</i>

<i>Sergio doesn't even
know your name.</i>

<i>Good.
I'm like background noise.
Just like jazz.</i>

Let me put it
like this, little boys,
replaceable, replaceable,

replaceable, jazz.

We gotta thicken
our revenue stream.

We gotta thicken
our fucking stream.

We gotta thicken
the fuck out of that
stream right now.

Shit is serious out here.

The music
business is failing.
The bubble done pop!

(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

Whose phone is that?

<i>It's my phone, man.
That's your phone?</i>

<i>It's mine, yeah.</i>

Answer it.

Definitely.
(CLEARS THROAT)

<i>What's up, bro? Yeah.
No, I can't talk right now.</i>

He forced me to answer it
in the middle of this meeting
in order to humiliate me.

<i>Yeah,
he's actually staring at me,
he's really pissed right now.</i>

<i>Swear to God,
I'm not joking, man.
Yeah, 6:30.</i>

I gotta go right now,
though. Bye.

I apologize about that.

Throw that phone
out of my office.

<i>Please don't
make me do that.</i>

Throw the phone
out of my office.

Throw that fucking
phone out of my office!

Right on.

(CELL PHONE CLATTERS)

<i>Y'all think this
meeting is for me.</i>

<i>No. No,
this meeting is not for me.
It's for y'all.</i>

<i>See, see,
I'm gonna be all right.</i>

<i>I'm straight. I got
villas in Brazil, Tahiti,</i>

East Hampton, Westhampton.

Sergio gonna be fine!

Fuck the recession.

I own 20 Koo Koo Roos.

WOMAN: Twenty-one, sir.

I own 21 Koo Koo Roos.

<i>Y'all don't own
one Koo Koo Roo.
Not one.</i>

<i>Not one.
Y'all are fucked.</i>


You all are fucked!

<i>SERGIO: He's not wrong.</i>

<i>Everyone loves chicken.
I'm doing fine.</i>

Please, people,
help me help you.

<i>Y'all need to come up
with some brilliant ideas
right now.</i>

<i>Who's first?</i>

MATTY: Me first, Sergio.

<i>There's this Taiwanese
phone company, TEC,</i>

<i>it's got great valuation,
it's a steal, dude.</i>

<i>We buy that shit,
we're not just
selling the ring tones,</i>

<i>we're selling
the fucking hardware,
bitch.</i>

Does this look like
a telephone company
to you?

We make records here.
This is not
Cingular Wireless.

<i>Anybody here know
anything about Cingular's
wireless broadband,</i>

any of that
fucking phone shit?

No.
Well, you know something,
you should.

<i>Don't be proud
of your ignorance.
Now tell me something good.</i>

I just discovered
the next Alicia Keys.

I swear to God above,
I can vouch for her.

SERGIO: The next
Alicia Keys.
Yeah.

What was your
last discovery?

Chocolate Daddy.

<i>I couldn't hear you.
What'd you say?</i>

Chocolate Daddy.

Yeah, Chocolate
motherfucking Daddy.

He discovered
Chocolate Daddy.

How much did
Chocolate Daddy sell?

Fifteen thousand units.

Fifteen thousand units.

<i>I'm proud of every unit.</i>

<i>I'm proud of those units.</i>

<i>I'm telling you,
this girl is...
Shut the fuck up.</i>

<i>This girl...
Don't talk.</i>

She got a...
Shut the fuck up, man.
Please.

<i>I'm not gonna
talk anymore.
Shut the fuck up!</i>

Fifteen thousand units!

You made me vouch
for Chocolate Daddy!
Fifteen thousand units!

I got six fucking kids!

You know how much
money that is to put
them through school?

You know
how many Air Jordans
six black kids wear?

<i>I'm sorry for my outburst.
I'm having a panic attack
right now.</i>

You. What you
so quiet for?

Just thinking of ideas.

<i>SERGIO: That's what we need.
We need ideas.</i>

Share.
Share with the group.

AARON: Okay.

Next month is the
10-year anniversary of

<i>Aldous Snow Live at
the Greek Theatre,</i>

which is one of
the highest selling
live albums of all time.

And if we did some sort
of anniversary concert...

I did the figures,
and it can generate

millions of dollars
in revenue.

So you think one show
is gonna change our game.

Well, we simulcast
on HBO, Facebook.

We charge them
each a million bucks
to co-sponsor the event.

<i>And that'll jump-start sales
of his back catalog,</i>

which we can re-release,
re-master, with
additional tracks

<i>and a live DVD
of the concert.</i>

Come on.
We need a game changer.

And Aldous Snow is not it.

Aldous Snow
is one of the last
remaining rock stars.

<i>With all due respect,
maybe a game changer's
not what we need.</i>

<i>He's a real musician,
and we have a chance
to make real music,</i>

<i>and that's how
we can succeed.</i>

And personally,
I think it would kick ass
to see him play live again.

<i>That's why we're all
in this business, right?</i>

<i>To... 'Cause we're fans?</i>

<i>That's really nice.</i>

<i>Now I need y'all
to listen to something
that's a game changer.</i>

Play that shit.

(RAP SONG PLAYING)

This is a game
changer right here.

Hey.

Hi.
Hi.

<i>I'm so tired.
Oh, my God.</i>

You look pretty.

Thank you!

It was such a crazy day.

<i>I can't wait to watch,
like, a hundred hours
of Gossip Girl.</i>

Me, too.

Yay!

Or instead of that,

<i>we could go see The Pixies
and The Mars Volta
play a show.</i>

<i>I don't think I can do
it tonight.</i>

I have to be back
at the hospital at,
like, 6:00 a.m.

<i>And who's Mars Volta, again?</i>

Oh.

(PSYCHEDELIC TRANCE PLAYING)

<i>I don't think
it's worth me
being tired over.</i>

<i>Just stay and watch
Gossip Girl with me.</i>

Okay, well,
then if you fall asleep,

then I get to go
to the concert?

<i>If you stay,
I'll have sex with you.</i>

<i>I feel like
you're blackmailing me</i>

<i>with your genitals.
That's not fair.</i>

Well, then do it to me.

<i>Listen, if you don't
go to that concert,</i>

<i>you don't get any
of my penis tonight.</i>

<i>I think
I'm gonna stay home.</i>

<i>Doesn't work
with the penis.
No, it's not fair.</i>

<i>Blackmail does not
work with the penis.
It doesn't work.</i>

<i>(SINGING) Inside you
are the stars unfurled</i>

<i>I've crossed me heart
and I've crossed the world</i>

<i>And I need you here
And I need to be inside you</i>

<i>Inside you</i>

<i>Inside you</i>

<i>There's got to be
some part of me
inside you</i>

Aldous Snow wants
to do the show.

<i>He's interested
and available.
Really?</i>

I want you to go to London
and pick him up.

<i>Then I want you to
take him to New York
to the Today Show</i>

to make the announcement
about the concert.

Then bring him back here
for the show at the Greek.


Are you...
Are you serious?

<i>Don't smile like that.</i>

It makes you look
like an 8-year-old boy

who just discovered
his first boner.

<i>I don't have one, so...</i>

This is your fucking moment!

You only get one
moment in life.

<i>It's not hiding
in some cubicle,
answering some fucking phone.</i>

Can you handle it?
Yeah. I can handle
the moment.

An artist
is the slipperiest,
most conniving

motherfucker on
the face of the earth.

<i>That's why you have
to watch your tushie</i>

while, at the same time,
you make them feel
like a star.

<i>It's called mind fucking.</i>

You ever been
mind fucked before?

<i>I don't think so.</i>

<i>I'm mind fucking you
right now.</i>

You are?

Can you feel my dick
fucking your mind?

<i>I don't... I can't
really feel anything.</i>

<i>See, that's it.
That's the art of it!</i>

<i>I'm mind fucking
the shit out of you.</i>

<i>I hope you're
wearing a condom,
'cause I have a dirty mind.</i>

That was a joke.

This is no time to joke.

Mind fucking is
not no joke.

You have to mind fuck
Aldous Snow.

<i>He's a drug addict, Aaron.</i>

You have to
show him balance.

People want to
see him fucked up,

<i>but they don't
want to see him
too fucked up.</i>

If this is fucked up
and this is sober,

<i>right here,
that's the perfect balance
right there.</i>

Not here. Right here.
Okay.

Do you like his music?

<i>I love his music.
Except for African Child.
That album sucked.</i>

<i>No. No. No.
You love African Child.</i>

<i>Your mother loves
African Child.</i>

<i>It's your girlfriend's
favorite album.</i>

<i>You love African Child.
You bought 10 copies
on the first day.</i>

<i>Okay. Yeah,
I love African Child.</i>

So lie to him.
No.

<i>We don't lie to people.
We don't do that.</i>

We just believe
in valid truths.

Okay.

<i>Do you like African Child?</i>

Hell, fucking no.

It was the most racist,
condescending shit ever made.

What the fuck you calling me?
A house nigger?

Do I look like
African Child?

<i>I don't... No.</i>

You just called me
a fucking house nigger.

(CLEARS THROAT)

<i>No. I don't think
you're a house N-word.</i>

<i>No. I wasn't...
No, I don't like
fucking African Child.</i>

<i>But if he asks me if
I like African Child,</i>

I love that shit!
I play that shit
in my fucking sleep.

<i>I wake up to it and
I brush my teeth to it.
I love African Child.</i>

Okay. I got it.

<i>But, no,
I don't love African Child.</i>

<i>Don't ever ask me
that fucking question again.</i>

Okay. I understand.

From the minute you
touch down in London,

you have 72 hours
to get Aldous Snow

to the Greek Theatre
in Los Angeles.

Do you understand me?

Yes. Definitely.

Your flight leaves
in three hours from LAX.

Please, do a good job.

AARON: Where is she?

Right there.

Hey.

Hi, sweetie.

<i>I have amazing news.
Let's go get some coffee.</i>

I think I was asleep.

<i>Go back to sleep.
I'll carry you
to coffee, okay?</i>

<i>You're funny.</i>

<i>You're funny.
You're funny.</i>

Sergio was
just so awesome.

<i>He was like,
"You got one moment,
and here's your moment."</i>

<i>And it was like 8 Mile.
You know? And he's
letting me do this!</i>

I mean, I get to
spend one-on-one time
with Aldous Snow.

Aldous Snow! I mean,
how awesome is that?

<i>Wow, that's awesome.</i>

I feel like I have
all these ideas for
his sound specifically.

<i>You know, I could help
resurrect the guy's career.</i>

<i>You know?
I mean, it's incredible.
It's, like, my dream.</i>

I have some kind
of big news, too.

I got offered
a residency,

a place in
a residency program,
at East Seattle General.

So, if I rank it first,
then I can get matched there,

which is pretty good.

Like Seattle, Seattle?

<i>Yeah. It's really,
really nice there.</i>

<i>And it's a bigger staff,
so they have better
call schedules,</i>

<i>so we could actually
spend some time together.
It's so nice!</i>

<i>(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry.</i>

You want to... You want to...
You want to move to Seattle?

Well, yeah.
To work in the hospital.

To work in the
hospital there, yeah.

What am I gonna do
in Seattle?

<i>Oh, my God, there's tons
of music stuff in Seattle.</i>

Nirvana!
Nirvana came
from Seattle.

<i>Can you not see how
it's a little alarming</i>

<i>that you've just decided
that I'm moving to Seattle?</i>

Do you have
an extra scalpel?

Do you want to
cut my balls off

<i>and put them in your pocket
so you don't just
metaphorically own them,</i>

you can physically
hold them in your pocket?

<i>I mean, I feel like
a '50s housewife right now.
Like my dreams don't count.</i>

<i>You're like
Michael Jackson's dad.
You're abusing me right now.</i>

<i>Okay. You know what?
We should just...
We're gonna table this.</i>

<i>We're gonna table
it because I can't...</i>

Guess what.
Just on a side note,
I had an idea today.

<i>You're moving to Africa.</i>

<i>Listen. You know how hard
I've been working for this.</i>

You know I am killing myself
in this internship.

This hospital will be
beautiful in Seattle,
and it will be good for us.

<i>That's all I'm saying.
I'm not trying to be hurtful.</i>

<i>I'm just saying
that I think it will be
good for us,</i>

<i>so we're moving to Seattle!
I don't want to
move to Seattle...</i>

<i>We're moving!
We're moving to Seattle.</i>

<i>No. We're not
moving to Seattle.</i>

Great.
So maybe we should
just take some time.

Are you having your
period or something?

<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

Are you on your
period or something?

Are you fucking
kidding me?

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey! Aaron Green,
yeah? From Pinnacle.

Hey, man! Hey!
Yes.

Wow. What?

Okay. Oh, two. Right.

Europe.

Europe. Yeah.
So, the Greek concert.

In about three days?
Three days.

Yeah, Aldous is
really excited. We all are.
This is fantastic.

<i>(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
I'm so ready!</i>

What?
Cheerio!

Great.

<i>I'm sorry, I'm nervous.</i>

Okay, come in, come in.

<i>Cool.
He's gonna be a moment.</i>

Just go and wait for him
outside on the terrace.

<i>(WHISPERS) I shouldn't
have done that.</i>

AARON: This is awesome.

Hey!

<i>I'm Aldous Snow,
the rock star.</i>

Oh, man! I mean,
your place is great!

This is gonna be
so much fun.

<i>We're gonna
travel together...
Who are you, mate?</i>

<i>I'm sorry.
I'm Aaron Green.</i>

What are you
doing in me house?

<i>I'm from Pinnacle.</i>

<i>I'm here to take you to
the 10-year anniversary
show at the Greek.</i>

<i>That's not for
another two months.</i>

Mum?

<i>Yeah?
This joker's here</i>

to change the date
of the Greek concert.

Why would they do that?

Why would they do that?
Duffy!

Yeah?
Remember that concert
in Los Angeles?

<i>Yeah.
It's supposed to be
in two months, isn't it?</i>

Yeah, two months.

<i>Two months, right, exactly.
They've changed it.</i>

What?

We had spoken about it.

<i>I've never seen you
before in my life.</i>

<i>I don't like change.
I don't like it
when things change.</i>

<i>It's unsettling,
isn't it?</i>

Would you like a biscuit?

Or a lolly? Codeine?

Mum, Duffy,
just objectively,
is this fair?

No.
No.

<i>It's not, is it?
I'm not being
unreasonable.</i>

No.
No.

He is.
Yeah.

Yes.

Sorry I changed the date.

Finally!

<i>Finally, he admits it.
That's my bad.</i>

<i>That's better.
That's better that
you've apologized,</i>

<i>'cause now we can
start to rebuild.</i>

Duffy?
DUFFY: Yeah?

Get us a couple
of lagers, mate.

<i>It really is
so nice to meet you.
I'm a lifelong fan.</i>

This lager hits the spot.

<i>We should probably
get going if we're gonna catch
that 6:00 p.m. Flight to JFK.</i>

Aldy, by the way,
whatever happened
to Jackie?

She was such a darling girl.
She was so polite.
I always liked her.

Did you? I really
liked Dad. Where is he?

<i>Fuck off, Aldous.
Your dad's a piece
of shit moocher.</i>

You see how she
talks about me dad?
Imagine that.

Anyways,
we really should get...

He had a heart attack
last month, my dad.

Look how she mugs him off.
Disgusting.

Well, if you like
the bastard so much,

<i>why don't you go
and visit him when
you're in America?</i>

<i>Perhaps I will.
Perhaps I'll pop over
and bond with him.</i>

<i>You'd like that,
wouldn't you?</i>

<i>Yeah, I'd love that.</i>

Cut you out of the equation,
you old bag.

We really...

<i>We should get going
if we're gonna
catch the flight.</i>

<i>I'm only joking.
I love you, Mummy.</i>

<i>I'm your special
little soldier,
ain't I?</i>

<i>Yes, you are.
You're my special
little boy.</i>

To Bushmills!
Wow.

Cheers.

<i>AARON: Hey, so, Aldous,
for the Today Show,</i>

they want to know
what song you want
to play.

Say it was up to you, Aaron,
what would you have me do?

<i>That's your call.
You're the artist,
you know,</i>

whatever you
feel like playing.

<i>I'd be really interested,
'cause you're, like,
a legitimate enthusiast.</i>

<i>I'd like to know what
you'd be into doing.</i>

If I had to choose,
all-time favorite

<i>would be The Clap.
That's a classic.</i>

<i>You know, that's...</i>

<i>That's, like,
my childhood right there,
you know.</i>

<i>Okay. Well,
I suppose the obvious choice
is African Child, right?</i>

MAN 1: Yeah.
MAN 2: Great tune.

<i>Yeah, I love African Child.</i>

<i>The song's awesome.
I brush my teeth
to it, you know?</i>

I think maybe
we should run to
the airport right now,

<i>'cause we're getting close.</i>

Change it to the next one.

Should we get out of this
bourgeois shithole?

(ALL LAUGHING)

<i>I disagree with
what you're saying!</i>

Bollocks!
I disagree highly!

Oh, no.

Hey, move into...
Make Aaron famous.

Aldous, here!

AARON: Hey, look,
the car service is here,
with all the bags.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Change it to the next one.

<i>So we're going
on the next one?</i>

This is why
we delay flights.
For this!

<i>What's up, man?</i>

Hey.

<i>I'm here with Aldous Snow,
so we have a table
in the back.</i>

Great.

Feel free to bring
Professor Snape.

<i>Come by. We'll play some
late-night Quidditch.</i>

Just leave it. Yeah.

Right?
Not everyone cares.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Excuse me.

Aldous. Hey. Sorry.

Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me.

<i>What? What are you doing?
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.</i>

<i>What's this?
Listen, hey, listen.</i>

<i>It's just getting super close
to that 12:00 a.m. Flight.</i>

<i>Aaron.
I don't...</i>

See them two girls?
Just there?

I want to fuck
them two girls.
Do you?

Yeah, they seem awesome.

They seem, like, cool.
Sure. Why not?

<i>I don't want to
think about that
right now, man.</i>

<i>That's cool. I just
want to leave here,
please.</i>

<i>You're in a long-term
relationship, right?</i>

No, just ended, actually.
See, my...

<i>Brilliant!
So, doesn't it make sense
that we would stay here</i>

and have possibly
the time of your life?

Fuck!

<i>Okay. What'd you prefer,
blonde or brunette?
Blonde or brunette?</i>

<i>I don't know.
What was your ex?</i>

Brunette.
Blonde it is.

Here we go!

Thank you.
Cheers.

Do you want to go to
the loo for a minute?

Why?

Oh, yes!
Oh, God.

<i>(TOILET FLUSHING)
My butt's getting wet!
My butt's getting wet!</i>

<i>I'm falling in the toilet!</i>

<i>I'm falling into the toilet!</i>

That was great. Awesome.

(ALL CHEERING)

Chase me!

<i>It's better
than Christmas!</i>

No, shut up.

ALDOUS: Go on, Aaron,
give her both barrels!

All right.
Can you give me
the key, please?

I love you.

<i>MAN: We've seen not
much of that today.
(PHONE RINGING)</i>

<i>Toss it!</i>

<i>And there it goes.</i>

<i>The hoop goes wide.</i>

Oh, no.

(HORNS HONKING)

<i>We're fine.
We got 35 minutes to catch
an international flight.</i>

<i>I wouldn't worry about it.</i>

Your mouth is smiling,
but your eyes look all sad.
Why?

Will you excuse me one sec?

Do you mind
driving faster,
please?

Would you like me to take
the Chiswick Roundabout

through Hounslow
and Staines?

What is this,
fucking Middle-earth?

Just take us to
the airport, okay?

AARON: Come on!
All right, sir.

Run! Run! Run!

Run! Just, try and keep up.

<i>ANNOUNCER: Final
boarding call...
Just keep up.</i>

<i>Hold the plane!
We're here!</i>

Aaron. Aaron.

<i>Aaron, you're sleeping.
Stop sleep.
Aaron, you're asleep.</i>

<i>You're asleep.
You're asleep, Aaron.
Here's your drink.</i>

<i>(GROANS) My leg.
Don't sleep so often.</i>

Cheers, mate.

Thank you for
waking me up.

<i>Why do you think
people keep saying
my music's shit?</i>

<i>I don't think that's
the case. Is it?
Is that the case?</i>

Yeah, a lot of negativity.
Lot of sniping
and snidey remarks.

<i>People are, "Yeah, he's shit,
he's a has-been, he's over,</i>

<i>"he's in his
greatest hits era."</i>

<i>Don't listen to that shit.
I love all your albums.</i>

<i>Do you love the album
African Child?</i>

<i>Yeah, of course.
I love African Child.
It's awesome.</i>

<i>Aaron. NME said
that African Child</i>

was the most detrimental thing
to happen to black culture

since the Rodney King
beatings.

Are you serious?
Yeah.

<i>I read in Rolling Stone
that African Child
came third</i>

behind famine and war

as the thing that had
been most damaging
to African life.

I find that hard
to believe,

but they say any press
is good press, right?
I mean...

Come on, mate.
You know, open up.

It seems as if
on your last album

you kind of went in
the studio and just did

whatever the producer
asked you to do.

<i>Right.
Yeah, no, that's exactly...
This is good.</i>

Aldous Snow needs
to be two guitars,

a bass and a drum kit
and his incredible voice.

<i>Vocals, yes! Yes.
And that's it.</i>

<i>And that's what
we want to hear.
That's what I love.</i>

<i>That's what all
your fans love.</i>

<i>It's just every artist
has this one album</i>

<i>that's just not good,
and that's it.</i>

<i>Honestly, I listen to
that and I'm just like,</i>

<i>"What is this piece of
shit I'm listening to?
Do I even know this artist?</i>

<i>"What the fuck
was he thinking?"</i>

<i>Don't fucking
talk to me like that,
you little prick.</i>

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

In future, if someone
asks you to give them
a critique of their work,

<i>don't rip out
their fucking gizzards</i>

and hold it in
front of their face.

What are you?
What do you know?

<i>I'm sorry.
Look, I don't know what
I'm talking about.</i>

Yeah, what you did
was very spiteful.

But it was also very
brave and very honest,

and I respect you
for doing that,

but the content of what
you said has made me
hate you.

<i>So there's a layer
of respect, admittedly,</i>

for your truthfulness,
peppered with hate.

Hateful respect.

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>It's over.</i>

<i>WOMAN ON TV: Scalpel! Now!
MAN: But, Doctor!</i>

Hey, I think I used
to have sex with her.

Yeah, yeah.
No, I did, I did.

(ANNOUNCER READING)

<i>Love is blind
Love is blind, love is blind</i>

<i>Aaron. I haven't performed
in three years, you know?</i>

<i>I need a drink if
I'm gonna do this show.</i>

<i>I feel tired.
I don't even want
to do it.</i>

<i>You'll do great.</i>

<i>We have, like, 14 minutes
to get to the Today Show,
so step on it.</i>

Aaron.

<i>Here's a photo of you
being sick last night.</i>

And so it is.

<i>Who's this guy?
He's really cute.</i>

<i>That's Naples. My son.</i>

The only thing that makes
me happy, the little twit.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hey, Sergio.

The 7:00 a.m. Flight!
What the fuck?

<i>You have lost control
of this shit.</i>

What you think?
Hold on.

<i>I mean, come on, player.
Lose the pink, man.
It's not gangsta.</i>

<i>That's your problem, man.
You always trying
to be gangsta.</i>

<i>What are you talkin' about?
The name of the song
is called I'm Gangsta!</i>

<i>You're five zippers
away from Thriller.</i>

<i>And you're one shirt away
from Carlton, motherfucker.</i>

Fuck off, Sergio.

<i>You can fuck me all you want,
but you gonna change
that goddamn pink.</i>

Aaron, listen,
your job is to keep him sober
for the next 30 minutes.

Hey, I feel like
a little whiskey.
Do you mind?

Thanks.

<i>I'm not gonna wear
this hat on the program,</i>

so whatever you do
to my hair now
is irrelevant.

I kind of feel like
getting a buzz on also.
Do you mind?

ALDOUS:
You enjoying yourself, mate?

<i>Goddamn.
This ain't cool,
what you're doing.</i>

<i>'Cause I need
that for the show.</i>

<i>This isn't cool.</i>

<i>Don't be a bitch, dude.
Let me get my smoke on.</i>

<i>Economist Paul Krugman
stops by to give us his
take on the economy.</i>

<i>Hey. I'm Aaron.</i>

Do you have any
idea how late you are?
You smell like a hobo.

<i>But first, our interview
and performance</i>

<i>from British rocker
Aldous Snow.</i>

<i>We'll be back right
after these messages.</i>

<i>MAN: And we're
in commercial.
Thanks, guys.</i>

Meredith! Hello,
this is Aldous Snow.

It is such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

I was getting
a little worried.
I know you

changed your flights
quite a few times.

<i>I didn't think you'd make it.</i>

ALDOUS: I apologize
for our tardiness.

<i>The culprit is
this gentleman.
He's Aaron Green.</i>

<i>That's why we're late,
because of him.</i>

Aaron!
Hey.

Come meet Meredith.
Hey, Meredith.

<i>Oh, my gosh.
It's lovely to meet you.</i>

My mom loves your shit.

There, see?

He looks after me.

<i>MEREDITH: I am here with
Aldous Snow of Infant Sorrow.</i>

Ready, one, take.

Aldous, tough question.
You were famously sober
for many years.

Now you are
famously not sober.

Are you on
something right now?

Yeah.
You are?

Yeah.
Several things?

<i>I'm just mucking
around, Meredith.
I've never taken drugs.</i>


<i>I love them.</i>

<i>Aldous,
I'm worried about you.</i>

Are you Paul Krugman?

Yeah.

My dad loves your shit.

Thank you.

<i>Hey, you're doing great, man!
You're doing great. So good.</i>

<i>I don't know the lyrics
to African Child.</i>

<i>You're funny as shit, man.</i>

<i>I need you to get the lyrics.
I'm serious.
I don't know the lyrics.</i>

<i>I can't remember
what the lyrics are.</i>

<i>They're, like, the most
simplest lyrics ever.</i>

Are they, mate?
What are they?

Yeah...

<i>(SINGING)
Across the mystic desert</i>

<i>Is a desert that is mystic</i>

<i>No! That's not the lyrics.</i>

<i>I don't know.
Thirty seconds.</i>

Thirty seconds.

<i>I will figure this out.
Don't worry.
You started this.</i>

(SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

<i>MEREDITH: I am here
with Aldous Snow
of Infant Sorrow.</i>

<i>I understand that
African Child was
commercially disappointing.</i>

<i>Who knows
the lyrics to African Child?
Who knows the lyrics to...</i>

...artistically fulfilling.

Yeah, but it was also
critically disappointing.

Yes.

<i>Hey, man.
What's up?</i>

<i>Do you know the lyrics
to African Child?</i>

<i>I don't know the lyrics.
I just pound the drum
and do the Africa face.</i>

<i>I need the lyrics
to African Child!</i>

<i>I need the lyrics
to African Child!</i>

<i>ALDOUS ON TV: Yes, in a way.
Although, in another way, no.</i>

<i>MEREDITH:
Well, we all want you...
We want you to sing.</i>

<i>What are the lyrics
to African Child?</i>

<i>ALDOUS: I guess I'm gonna.
Okay, he's gonna sing.</i>

<i>We'll be right back
with Aldous Snow.
I'm gonna.</i>

(CHEERING LOUDLY)

It is a wonderful day
here in New York City.

We are seconds away
from Aldous Snow

performing live out
in Rockefeller Plaza.

<i>I can't...
Sorry, Meredith!</i>

Oh, boy.

<i>And now, Aldous.</i>

<i>Thank you.
I'm Aldous Snow.</i>

<i>And this is African Child.</i>

<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

Take three.
Can you hit the delay?

<i>Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.</i>

<i>I want to...
Do you remember The Clap?</i>

<i>Play The Clap.</i>

<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

<i>(SINGING)
We got the clap</i>

<i>You got the clap
We cooked the rocks</i>

<i>You took the smack
Ah, yeah</i>

We love you!

<i>We got the itch
You got the scratch</i>

<i>Burns, burns, burns
Like the head of a match</i>

<i>You took the front,
I took the back
Ah, yeah</i>

<i>We got the clap</i>

<i>We got it</i>

<i>I got the clap!</i>

<i>I got the clap, too!</i>

<i>I'm so shitfaced.</i>

<i>What's going on?
My gosh.</i>

<i>We got the clap
You got the clap</i>

<i>Wiped my face on
the welcome mat</i>

<i>We got the clap
Can't be beat</i>

<i>Got it off
the back of a toilet seat</i>

<i>Shake your hips
Mind your feet</i>

<i>We got the clap</i>

<i>We got it</i>

Oh, no.

Tell the West Coast
they gotta trim the balls.

Ready, one, take.

<i>We got the clap
Can't be beat</i>

<i>We got the clap</i>

<i>We're gonna be performing
at the Greek Theatre in
two days! See you there!</i>

Aldous!
Aldous!

Pandemonium!

Oh, man!
That was awesome!

So cool.
I enjoyed that.

<i>I couldn't have
done it without you,
do you know what I mean?</i>

<i>The Clap. Great idea!</i>

You rocked that shit!

It was amazing.
It was crazy, man.
That is so fucking crazy.

Oh, man.

Central Park is beautiful.

Are you sure you
should do that, man.

<i>We're on our way
to the airport.</i>

<i>Let's go jogging!</i>

Come on, join in with me.

<i>No, I don't...
This... You know...</i>

Please!
For us, our friendship.

(UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Thank you. Thank you
for that. I'll use it.</i>

I would grind that.
I would ride
the shit out of her.

Yeah,
I would kiss her face.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

<i>Don't take it.
Don't take it.</i>

Who is it? Sergio?

<i>Shit, it's Daphne.
Worse.</i>

<i>Hey, Daph.
Hey, sweetie.</i>

<i>What's up?</i>

<i>Listen, I'm just calling
'cause I wanted to apologize.</i>

<i>I just slept for,
like, 20 straight hours</i>

<i>and I'm feeling really bad,</i>

<i>and I just wanted
to say I'm sorry
about what happened.</i>

I was out of my mind.

<i>Okay.
Really?</i>

Yeah. Thanks.

<i>So, I'd like to
make it up to you</i>

when you get back
from your trip.

<i>Wait, what's up?</i>

I would like to
make it up to you.

<i>Fun Daphne got us
tickets to Radiohead.</i>

<i>Wait, what's up?</i>

Can you hear me?

I thought we broke up.
You broke up with me, right?

Aaron, we live together.
We have a home together.

How could you think
we were broken up?

<i>Because that's
what you said.</i>

<i>You really think that
we're broken up right now?
What have you been doing?</i>

<i>You know,
you're so holier-than-thou
about being a doctor.</i>

<i>You know, just 'cause
you're a doctor doesn't
make you a good person.</i>

<i>The Nazis have doctors,
Daphne.</i>

They had Nazi doctors
that fixed Nazi legs

so they could walk around
being angry, okay?

So...
What are you
talking about?

<i>ALDOUS: Aaron!
Is it your girlfriend?
Let me have a go.</i>

<i>Aaron is very busy now.
Press seven for fellatio.</i>

<i>Here you go.
Don't hang about.</i>

<i>There's pussy
everywhere, mate.
I can't do them all.</i>

Hey, that was Aldous.

<i>You know,
here's some medical advice
from your Nazi doctor.</i>

Herpes is incurable.

I labored under
the myth of monogamy
for seven years with Jackie,

and it was pointless.

So you only slept
with Jackie?

No. No. I mean,
I slept with other people,

but I always
told her about it.

Monogamy.

I realize now my dad
was just a realist.

I used to be angry...
All right, love.

<i>I used to be angry
'cause he abandoned me,</i>

but really, he was
just being a realist.

<i>You can't remain
in that situation.</i>

<i>Your dad lives in,
in Vegas, right?</i>

<i>Mmm-hmm.
That's right, yeah.
He lives there, yeah.</i>

You should invite him...
Hello, love.

Your dad should...
Nice.

You should invite
him to the show.
You want me to get on that?

<i>I don't know
if we really have that
type of relationship,</i>

you know,
me and my dad.

<i>He always wants
something from me.
It's a bad idea.</i>

<i>Well, I'm sure he'd love
to come see you perform.</i>

<i>Let's put it this way.
If I had a concert,
my dad would come.</i>

He would come,
like, five hours early

and ask all the roadies
what town they were from,

and if he knew
anybody from their town.

<i>He'd be proud.</i>

<i>He's good.
He's a good man.</i>

Yeah. Yeah.

<i>I hate to be a downer,
but it's getting really late.</i>

We have a flight
early in the morning.
Do you mind if...

Yeah, yeah, right.
Hey, Aaron!

Have you ever drunk absinthe,
like from the 1900s?

No.
Picasso drank it.

Oi!

Absinthe!

<i>All right, well,
we'll take one shot</i>

<i>and then we'll go
back to the hotel?</i>

Just a little sip
of naughty water,

and we go back
to the hotel. Simple.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Aaron! You lost control,
motherfucker.

<i>Stampin' on an
African child!</i>

Do you like it when
I whip you, Aldous?

Why is Moby whipping us?

Whee!

Whee!

<i>Look, I'm eating
my own head.</i>


<i>(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING
OVER PHONE)</i>

I accept your apology.

<i>GIRL: What's
Aldous Snow like?</i>

<i>AARON: He's the best.
Hello?</i>

<i>It's sort of like...
I'm basically</i>

like his new producer
or whatever.

That is so amazing
for you!

<i>Hello?
AARON: Why are your
boobs different sizes?</i>

<i>'Cause the left...</i>


<i>AARON: I don't
care either, Daphne.</i>

<i>You live in Seattle,
I'll fucking live
in New York.</i>

(GROANS LOUDLY)

<i>ALDOUS: Look how
beautiful you are.</i>

<i>Do you see how
beautiful you are, Jackie?</i>

<i>I like being so close.</i>

<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

(ALDOUS SINGING)

<i>Jackie Q, Jackie Q
I love you</i>

<i>Jackie Q</i>

Fucking hell.

<i>Jackie Q, Jackie Q

You silly bastard.

<i>I love you.
Why don't we
make a sex tape?</i>

<i>'Cause I don't want
to make a sex tape.
Yes.</i>

Fucking hell.

<i>Come on, it'll be fun!
Please, Aldous, come on.</i>

I will not call you.

<i>Let me marry you.
Please, Aldous.</i>

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

<i>ALDOUS: Jackie?</i>

Is that you, Aldous?

<i>No, Aldous Snow
has got better things</i>

<i>to do first thing
in the morning</i>

<i>than call up
an ex-girlfriend.</i>

<i>What are you doing?
Where are you?</i>

Just in our old flat,
actually.

In New York.

<i>You with anybody?</i>

Some affable nitwit.

Where are you now, Jackie?

<i>Los Angeles.</i>

<i>What are you doing?</i>

Sleeping next
to Lars Ulrich.

Lars Ulrich?
From Metallica?

Yeah.

<i>Why?

<i>What's Lars packing
in the drumstick region?</i>

<i>I can't tell you
that right now.</i>

<i>He's sleeping
right next to me.</i>

<i>What are you so interested
in Lars for, Aldous?</i>

<i>You jealous?</i>

<i>No. I don't get jealous.</i>

I miss you, Aldy.

<i>I miss you. I miss you.</i>

I miss you.

<i>Listen,
why don't you be a good girl
and put the phone down</i>

<i>next to your vagina,
'cause I need to talk to her.</i>


<i>Hello?
Is that Jackie's vagina?</i>

Hello, Aldous.

<i>All right.</i>

<i>How are you?
I've missed you.</i>

<i>I'm very well, thank you.
I've just come back
from Brazil.</i>

<i>What's the weather like?</i>

<i>It's quite wet
down there, actually.
Fuck off.</i>

I really miss
your cock, Aldous.

<i>I'm gonna come
and see you, Jackie.</i>

<i>I don't think you should,
but I do, I really
miss you, Aldous.</i>

<i>I'm stuck here
with a hard-on.</i>

<i>I don't know
what to do with it.</i>

<i>Hey, babe.
Who's on the horn?</i>

<i>It's Mum. She's just
calling up from London.</i>

<i>LARS: Let me
take care of this.</i>

<i>Oi, Aldous.
It's Lars.</i>

<i>"I'm ashamed that
you're with a drummer,
Jackie.</i>

<i>"I'd always dreamed
that you would marry
a front man.</i>

<i>"With charisma.
Razzmatazz.</i>

<i>"Rough around the edges,
but with stars in
his eyes, you know."</i>

<i>Jackie,
your mom kind of sounds
like a Monty Python skit.</i>

Give me the phone back.
Okay. Okay, okay, sorry.

<i>Darling,
I've gotta go, all right?</i>

<i>I'll see you later.</i>

<i>I'm coming to see you.</i>

<i>(SHUSHING) Don't say
anything else, all right?
I gotta go. Bye.</i>

Get up.

<i>I can't be here
anymore now.</i>

Huh?

<i>I can't believe
we're actually on
time for a flight.</i>

Hey, can you
pull over, mate?

Actually, we, we have
a flight to catch.

Yeah, no, just pull
over here off Linden.
I want to get a pretzel.

Dude really wants
a pretzel.

<i>He's not getting
a pretzel, is he?</i>

Not the kind you
put mustard on.

Go, please.

Next in line!

You two traveling together?
Okay.

You mind coming in
back for a quick exam?

Just come this way, please.
Thank you.

I need you to put this
into your bottom hole.

What?

Put this into your rectum.

Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

What the fuck, man?

<i>What are you doing?
We're in the middle
of the airport!</i>

<i>It's a necessary
part of your job, Aaron.
Don't be complicated.</i>

<i>I won't do it.
I won't do it. No.</i>

Put it in!
Relax your anus.
Stop! Just stop!

<i>Aaron! If you don't do it,
I ain't gonna do the concert.</i>

<i>I'll just get on a plane
and go back to London.</i>

The only logical thing
to do in this situation

is to put this
deep in your asshole.

COP: Please keep
the line moving, sir.


My phone is ringing.

Your phone is not ringing.

<i>It's Sergio.</i>

<i>It's not Sergio.
There's no one there!</i>

Aaron, stop pretending
to talk to Sergio!

Right, mate. Hello!

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hey! The couch
is not for jumping!

Aaron, my superstar.
Great news.

The concert sold out
in 10 fucking minutes.

<i>Hey, so I'm having
a possible health issue
with the talent.</i>

What kind of health issue?

<i>His eyes ain't rolling
to the back of his head,
are they?</i>

<i>No.
Babe! I don't see
no string cheese!</i>

All I see is Babybels
and chocolate pudding!

WOMAN: Baby,
look in the dairy drawer!
Next to the Go-Gurts.

<i>I don't see no Go-Gurts!</i>

<i>You need to put these shits
where I can see them.</i>

<i>He wants me to
put drugs up my ass.
And I don't know what to do.</i>

Then you put
the drugs up your ass.

<i>What's the problem?</i>

<i>Please don't
make me do that.</i>

<i>This is the opportunity
that you've been waiting for.</i>

You are now in
the power position.

You hold all the power
in your ass.

<i>He will do whatever
you want him to do.</i>

<i>Isn't that enabling him?</i>

<i>Yes, that's what we do.</i>

<i>It's only a little bit

<i>Nobody's gonna die.</i>

<i>You know what

<i>(SINGING)

<i>Come on, mate,
we ain't got all day.</i>

<i>It's not recreational!
It's not meant to be a hobby!
Just get it up!</i>


Close the door behind you!
Hurry up!

Why did you do this to me?

Out of love.

Are you sure
you should be
doing this stuff?

<i>Have you got
an anti-drug message that
you're gonna convey now?</i>

<i>I just feel like
it couldn't hurt
to not be on heroin.</i>

<i>Couldn't it? You know,
I used to be sober.</i>

When I was sober,
I was worried about,

<i>"Is this the twilight
of my career?"</i>

<i>"Is the mother of my child
a cruel, evil, brilliant,
savant, idiot genius?"</i>

<i>You know,
"Am I bringing up my
kid the right way?"</i>

<i>Now, I'm just
worried about drugs.</i>

<i>Your life's to-do list
must be a baffling document.</i>

<i>You're worried about
so many things, Aaron.</i>

<i>You're worried about
will we get to the show?</i>

Will I perform well?
Will you get the credit
that you deserve?

Mine has on it
but one word.

Do you know
what that word is?
Oh, no.

I have to sneeze.
What?

I have to sneeze.

<i>But I'm terrified
that my bowels will
evacuate if I do.</i>

If you sneeze,
it is very important

that you clench
at the same time.

Aaron.

<i>I'm gonna sneeze.
I'm gonna clench
and sneeze.</i>

<i>Listen to me.
Dude, I'm gonna
clench and sneeze.</i>

<i>Don't close your eyes.
It's impossible to sneeze
if your eyes are open.</i>

Open your eyes.

<i>You're being selfish.
I'm gonna clench
and sneeze.</i>


Is it still in?
I think I broke a rib.

Hello, to you.
Hi.

<i>I'm just checking
if flight 51 is on time.</i>

<i>Let's see.</i>


<i>Hello, gorgeous.
That flight to
Vegas left yet?</i>

Not yet.

Well, stick us on
that then, please.

Two first-class tickets?

No.
Yeah.

<i>Yeah, switch us
onto the Vegas flight,
me and him.</i>

All right.
No.

I want to visit my dad.

It was your idea.

<i>That's not what I meant.
I meant after the show
to see your dad.</i>

<i>You didn't specify.
He didn't specify.</i>

Yeah, well, I... You know,
I did that special favor
for you earlier.

So, maybe you
could return that favor
and we could just go to LA.

What favor?

You know.
The favor that
I did earlier.

<i>My mind's a blank.</i>

Oh! He means
the heroin.
Nope.

<i>His bum's
all full of heroin.
He doesn't mean that.</i>

<i>No, no, no.
I'm a terrible drug addict.</i>

Mule!
No.

<i>He's a mule!
No.</i>

<i>You're the devil.
Perfect.</i>

All right,
I want my package now.

<i>I'm not gonna
give you the drugs</i>

<i>until we're in Los Angeles,
post-show.</i>

<i>Just to clarify,
are you saying you're
withholding my narcotics?</i>

<i>You made a huge
tactical error
and now I'm in control.</i>

Okay.

Are you ticklish?
Okay, stop.

Okay, stop.
Give me the package.

Seriously stop!
Seriously stop!
Seriously stop!
