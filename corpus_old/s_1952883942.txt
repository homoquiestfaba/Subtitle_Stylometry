It hurts.

Much sorry.

It was my fault.

Try to sleep now.

Why have you brought me to that

It was with Bob when we
met,

now with me.

Do you and Bob know that?

What to do with you?

Bob is a dangerous character!

I do not want to find me while
karam his girlfriend.

Let me worry about me.

I once saw Bob
killed a man.

When did this happen?

When we were in Soledad.

Mexican.

You and I have also killed the man.

First: we shot it, we did not
killed by the hands.

Second, we killed him and why
sitting here.

And thirdly, the plan is now to be Bob
kill.

Which will mean that Bob killed
at least two people,

and who knows what everything is done
for which we do not know.

Your point is ...?

My point is ...

I think your friend
Betty is not worth the risk

which incur.

You know nothing about it.

I know that she was with Bob.

I know that she was with you.

How do you think is persuaded
Holland to appear exactly where

where we wanted?

You mean that was the
Holland?

For one hundred thousand dollars and I would
a fight with the Netherlands.

Good. This conversation is over.

fair.
