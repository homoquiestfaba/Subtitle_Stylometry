Today as a matter of fact.

â™ª Hey we're gonna take what we can â™ª

â™ª You're gonna sit up and let them know â™ª

â™ª Just find the courage... â™ª

Surprise!

Happy Birthday Abby.

Oh my baby's 16.
I can't believe it.

Bob are you crying?

What? No Sue.

I've got an eyelash in my eye.
Oh.

Look it's your first
16th birthday picture.

Ech Dad.

What? I like it.

It's going to go
on our family Web page.

No.
Come on sweetheart.

Make a wish.

Okay.

You know what I wish?

I wish my dear sweet family
would finally understand

they can't just barge into
my room any time they want.

I'm not a kid anymore.

I need privacy and boundaries.

I need my own space.

I've been looking forward
to this day all my life

and now that it's here I wish
you would all just get out

and stop spoiling it.

Love you.

I don't know.

Mm. Ow. Ow! Eww.

I'm 16 finally.

Today is going to be magical.

Told you she wouldn't like it.

I don't understand her.

She's probably nervous
about her Sweet 16 party.

Oh Bob the party lights.
They're in the garage.

I'm on it.

Wow. Thanks.

Ah-ah.
It's for your sister.

Too yellow.

Too blue.

Too pink.

Too nighttime.

Too daytime.

Too...15.

Perfect.

Hey Abs.

Hello. Knock much?

What?

Mom made you a special
birthday breakfast.

Aw that's sweet.
Just put it over there.

Not you. The food.

Two secs.

â™ª This is your breakfast â™ª

â™ª Da na na na no â™ª

â™ª But I'm gonna eat it â™ª

You do realize
that's not a real guitar.

â™ª Da na na now â™ª

Mike!
Whoa.

Can I have a loan?

No you cannot have a loan.

I have been saving up for
my Sweet 16 party tonight.

The best Sweet 16 party ever.

Ah yes. Wish number 15.

What?

Abby's 16 wishes.

When I'm 16 I'll have
the best party ever.

Hey that's private.

Yeah not really.

You honestly thought
you'd get all this today?

I'm an essentially
hopeful person.

The first one's hilarious.

The Joey Lockhart.

He's an international pop star
with about a bazillion fans.

Why would you even wish that?

I was 7.
You were delusional.

You were 5
and wore a cape to school.

The other wishes are more
realistic like wish number 3.

No no no.

Sassy.

Mm not a good idea Abs.

Why not?

If you decorate your room
the way you dress ouch.

Ucch.

And what's with
the mug shot on 16?

It's not a mug shot.

It's Logan Buchanan.

Your crushed
on the quarterback?

How clichÃ©.

For your information
he's also in the drama club

and once attended
Chess Masters.

I know. I was there.

He wanted to buy my chem notes.

He's perfect.

And if I get my wish
he'll talk to me today.

Aah! Ha ha ha!

Ohh. Krista Cook.

Cool car.

It's perfect!
I love it!

It's not cool.
It's terrible.

I don't know what I did
to deserve this.

Why was Krista of all people
born on the same day I was?

Yeah that must be annoying

how she always gets better stuff
than you for her birthday.

â™ª Ohh â™ª

Sync by Hana.Bean
www.Addic7ed.Com

I don't know
why she hates me so much.

Ever since the third grade

she's always trying
to ruin my birthday.

Which is also her birthday.

Why are you still here?
Get out.

Dibs on the bathroom.

Excuse you.

â™ª Golden hair a perfect face â™ª

â™ª There's something missing â™ª

â™ª Are you theirs? â™ª

â™ª Hard and sad â™ª

â™ª That someone's listening â™ª

Come on Abs. You've
been in there for a year.

32 minutes.
Most girls take twice that.

Hold your horses.

Perfect.

It's all yours.

Shouldn't have
skipped breakfast.

Today is going to be perfect and
nothing not even Krista Cook

is going to ruin it.

Wow. it's a major infestation.

Looks like it's been building
for about oh 16 years

by the looks of it.

How long will it take
to get them out?

Several days.
A year at the most.

A year?

Oh.

I managed to save this.

Ohh.

This can't be happening
not to me not today.

Daddy I left some clothes
in my gym locker.

Please please please
drive me to school.

I don't think so Pumpkin.

Sweet. Hey Krista.

Hey can I ride?

Hop in.

Buckle up.

Great.
I'll just take the bus.

By myself on my birthday.

Hmm.

Here.

Mm.

Thanks Jay.

You look pathetic.

Nice to know I can count on
you to state the obvious.

Sorry about your house.

How'd you know?

Krista texted
the entire junior class.

That's just peachy.

What's this?

Happy Birthday?

Not really.

Come on.

It's beautiful Jay.
Where's the other half?

Best friends forever.

Oh Jay that's sweet.

Do you like it?

I love it.

It's the best thing that's
happened to me all day.

That bad huh?

Yes.

I've been planning
for this day for eight years.

I mean this was
supposed to be the day

I started acquiring
all of the wonderful things

that come with being
grown up...

things like freedom
and privacy and respect.

But what do I get?

Wasps. Wasps.

Even my backyard is infested.

Where am I going to have
my Sweet 16 party?

You could use my basement.

Ew. No.

All right.

Well the day is young.

Good things could still happen.

Like what?
Like taking the bus?

I hate taking the bus.

This is the worst birthdays
in the history of birthdays.

Today wasn't supposed
to be like this.

Today was supposed to be...
magical.

Abigail Jensen?

Y-Y-Yes.

This is for you.

Happy Birthday sweetie.

Don't open it.
Why?

Real mail is delivered to
your house not your bus stop.

So?
It could be a bomb.

It's not a bomb.
It's a birthday present.

And I'm opening it.

"Make a wish light a candle

and watch your Sweet 16
birthday wishes come true."

Great.

Candles.

Not even a stupid gift card.

Wait there's something else.

Hold this.

What are you doing?

Read wish number 8.

"When I'm 16..."

I'm lighting
one of these candles.

What if something bad happens?

What if something good happens?

And look if it's a joke

the worst that can happen
is we take the bus.

Here.

Ladies and gentlemen

Joey Lockhart!

You Abby Jensen?

Yes.

â™ª Hurry up â™ª

â™ª Put on my pretty shoes â™ª

â™ª Hurry up â™ª

Happy Birthday Abby.

â™ª Pretty girls can choose â™ª

Thanks.

â™ª Here we are just us girls â™ª

â™ª All of the stuff having fun â™ª

â™ª In the princess world â™ª

â™ª The princess world â™ª

â™ª The princess world â™ª

Oh what just happened?

I've had a crush on him
since I was 7.

When I'm 16
I'll meet Joey Lockhart.

What are you talking about?

It's wish number 1.

Look Jay. The candles work.

Yeah but we're still
stuck taking the bus.

Maybe not.

I lit candle number 1 and wish
number 1 on my list came true.

I think the numbers
on the candles

correspond with the numbers
on my wish list.

Give me number 8.

When I'm 16 I'll have
my own car preferably red.

No way.

Way.

Check it out.

Gosh this is fun.

I can't believe it.
This is my dream car.

It's all yours sweetie.
Want to drive?

Yes.
No.

Come on. I have my permit.

My dad lets me practice

in the Hasty Mart
parking lot all the time.

Yeah at midnight
when it's empty.

Abby when a total stranger
drives up to you on the street

and offers you a car
you can't just take it.

She's not a total stranger.
You look very familiar.

Well we're not doing this.

Why not?
Yeah why not?

Because...
you don't have a driver's license

until you take the test
after school.

Good point. I'll drive.
You two get in.

What? Not until you
tell us who you are.

I'm Celeste. I'm here to make
Abby's 16 wishes come true.

Oh. Well that explains
pretty much exactly nothing.

Come on Jay.

This is the most wonderful
amazing magical thing

that's ever happened to me.

50 years from now when you're
looking back at your life

don't you want
to be able to say

you had the guts
to get in the car?

I'm going to regret this.

Yes! Get your stuff.
Come on. Get in the car.

All right go go go.

Just so we're clear you're
some kind of magical being

like an elf or a fairy?

Sure. Why not?

You don't sound so sure.
Jay.

You just do birthdays
or other events too?

He babbles when he's nervous.

Why don't you relax Jay
and enjoy the ride?

Hold on.

Yahoo!

Whoa! Mommy!

Whoo!

That was awesome.

Have we landed yet?
What's it look like?

What does what look like?
Her home planet.

Sorry Jay.

The only alien planet you'll be
visiting today is high school.

I already have my license.

My dad has connections
at the DMV.

Yo Logan check out that ride.

Hey Jensen did you
get new wheels too?

Uh...

Yeah. These are my new wheels

which I bought myself for
my birthday which is today.

Cool.

No way this is yours.

What can I say?

I'm a saver
not a spender like you.

Oh man.

I got to make some bank.

Umm...

What are you doing?

Saving you from more
humiliation.

What?
I'm not humiliated.

This is the best birthday ever.

Look. Wish number 15.

When I'm 16 I'll have
the best party ever.

If the candles keep
working like this

my party's going to be sick.

Hey party tonight at my house.

You're all invited.

Come on.

Come on. It's okay.

It's okay.

Want to make some cash?

Yes.

Put these up everywhere.

Meet me at the voting table
after first period.

Okay. You go find
some real clothes to wear.

I'll tell Miss Hackl
you got a late time okay?

Thanks Jay.

Ugh.

Ew.

When I'm 16...

For me? Thank you.

Okay.

Wish number 2. All right.

Okay.

What?

What's going on?

Come on.

Uh Miss Duffy.

Jensen.

I'll take that.

Keep it up Theodore and
you'll be president one day.

You really think so?

Absolutely.

Ohh!

So you can tell the future too?

Oh no. Just gave Ted hope.

Come on in.

So what's up sweetie?

What's up?
You know what's up.

That's why you're here pretending
to be the counselor.

Why didn't that
stupid candle light?

Because of the rules.

The rules?

Oh boy. You don't
get out much do you?

What are you talking about?

The candles are magic
and all magic has rules.

One candle
and one wish per hour.

You lit candle number 1
at 7:58 this morning

and Joey Lockhart showed up.

Then you lit candle number 8
at precisely 8 A.M.

Your wishes were two minutes apart
but within different hours.

Oh. So now I have to wait...

27 minutes. - ...
before I make another wish.

Great. You could have printed
that on the box you know.

Any other magic candle rules
I should know about?

Only one but it's a doozy.

The magic in the candles
expires at midnight tonight

so no more wishes after then.

Oh and all the wishes you've
made by then become permanent.

At midnight.
Yeah.

So at midnight that gorgeous
car out there is mine forever?

Absolutely.

And in 26 1/2 minutes I'll have
cuter clothes than Krista Cook.

Yeah.

She really can't stand you.

Oh.

You know about that?

I shouldn't do this but...

Read for yourself.

â™ª Oh yeah â™ª

Oh no.

I couldn't.

Well maybe just a page or two.

I suggest 10 23 and 37.

Oh.

Be a little more careful where
you light those puppies.

Thanks.

Hmm.

Whoa.

Good stuff?

You have no idea.

Thanks for voting for me.

Krista!

I know you've loathed me
since we were 8 years old

but I didn't know
you've been keeping score.

Where did you get that?

From the Birthday Fairy.

Right. Give it to me.

When we were 10
I had my first sleepover

so you decided to have one too

but you paid everybody
to come to yours.

You have no right
to read that. It's mine.

Well then why
is it all about me?

When we were 12 I entered
the school talent show

with my baton twirling act.

So you entered too
juggli 12 batons.

Every year you' competed with
me and every year you've won.

You've tortured me
since the grade.

Can you just give it a rest?

Don't play innocent with me.

You know what you did.

And for this I'm going to make
sure nobody comes to your party.

Here.

What's this?

It's an invitation to my Sweet
16 birthday party tonight.

Everybody's going to be there.

Now if you'll excuse me I
have some campaigning to do.

Krista you don't
need to campaign.

You're the only name on the
ballot running for president.

Well then I'm sure to win.

Why are you doing this?

You're not even interested
in student government.

And you are?

Well I... I didn't think so.

Ahem.

Hey Krista.

So they said you needed
help with something?

Hand these out for me.

Sure.

Thanks.

She's doing it.
She's ruining my birthday.

Again.

Just don't let her get to you.

You're right Jay.

I'm going to put an end
to her reign of terror.

Right about now.

List. Hurry.

When I'm 16 I'll have
the cutest clothes in school.

Hi-hi.

Celeste it's beautiful.

I know right?

I've been waiting for you
to make this wish.

I just love shopping
especially when it's free.

I don't even know
where to start.

That's what I'm here for.

Now close your eyes
and let me work my magic.

Ever since the third grade
whatever I did Krista did better.

She's never satisfied unless
she's winning and I'm losing.

But today I decided she's t going
to make me miserable anymore.

I have a plan and this
wish it's the first part.

Would you say
Krista Cook always has

the cutest clothes in school?

And shoes and handbags.

Not anymore.

That top is not an original
you-know-who is it?

It is.

Shut up.

Oh those shoes
are so to die for.

I hate you.

Want to have lunch near us?

Sure.

Yay. I totally just want to
sit next to that handbag.

You mean this handbag?

I got it for my birthday last year.

You're not all that Jensen.

Yoo-hoo Abby!

I'm so sorry.

Give me that old thing.

This one's so hot it
hasn't even come out yet.

Thank you so much.

I'll just ship you
the rest of the collection

when the infestation's over.

Auf Wiedersehen.

I know what you're doing
and it's not going to work.

I'm just trying to have the best
birthday of my entire life.

Well good luck with that
because it's not over yet.

All right everybody.
On the track in five.

Late again Jensen.

Yes Miss Duffy I am late.

I had to go back to my locker
for this.

I see.

That's still no excuse
for tardiness

but that is a beautiful bag.

It's for you.

Me?
Mm-hmm.

I was saving it
for your Christmas present

but look it matches
your track suit perfectly.

Ha ha! It actually does.

Happy Monday.

Well Happy Monday to me.

Well ladies what do you say
instead of running killer laps

we all have a nice friendly
game of volleyball?

Way to go Abby.

I'm going

How are you feeling?

I'm fine.

I had a weird nightmare.

Oh honey that was real.
Abby Jensen creamed you.

Oh and you're wanted
in the principal's office.

Run along.

Yeah that's so true.
That's so true.

Makes my day.
Yeah.

You wanted to see me
Mr. Smith?

Yeah. Yeah.

Ms. Cook
the election's over.

How can it be over?
A lot of people haven't voted yet.

Actually we had a 100% voter turnout.

Whoop! Ooh!

What's going on here?

Good morning students!

I'm very pleased to announce

the winner of the most votes
for the Student Body President

is Abby Jensen!

Yes!

I just want to thank
everyone who voted for me

and made this dream possible.

No. It's not possible.

Her name isn't
even on the ballots!

Let... go.

That is all.

Whoa. Wow.
You all right?

Abby was a write-in.

Better luck next time Krista.

Ha!

I finally beat Krista Cook.

Had a little help.

I know. Isn't it amazing?

This day just keeps
getting better and better.

Yeah for you.

I know right?

â™ª Oi â™ª

â™ª Java â™ª

â™ª Oi â™ª

Can we just do this experiment?

We both need extra credit.

Nah.

I'll just give the teacher some
strappy sandals and a pashmina.

No. Just give it a rest.

What's wrong with you?

I don't know.
This whole wish thing.

You're changing too fast Abby.

I can't keep up.

What do you mean?

You've always been
allergic to volunteer work.

And now all of a sudden
you're Student Body President?

What can I say?

The people spoke
and they wanted me.

The candles spoke and you have no
idea what you just wished for.

Yes I do.

Being president
is like an honor.

Being president is
an important job Abby.

It should do to someone
who really wants it.

Oh like who? Like Krista?

No.

Well I'm sure
I'll do just fine.

I'll have you to help me.

Come on.
You can't be mad at me.

Why not?

Because it's my birthday.

Because we're best friends.

Because I'm Student Body President
and I get free lunch. Ta-da!

No way.

Way way. Every day.

Now hand over
your goofy glasses

and let your commander in chief
buy you a sandwich.

What kind of sandwich?

Any kind you want.

Come on.

There she is!

You see? Ha ha.
They love me.

What have you done now?

Wish number 10.

I looked in the mirror and I
was tired of being invisible.

When I'm 16 I'll be popular.

Oh hi Joey.

Abby smile!

Sure I'll sign it.

I loved that wish.

Right.

Okay people make a hole!

Here she comes!

Back up. Come on.

Move your hair.
Thank you. Okay.

Peeps.

And I don't have to do a thing.

Just show up.

They're planning
your birthday party.

Mm-hmm.

Their dads
are business partners.

Apparently
they own half of Vegas.

They're throwing my party
at one of their hotels.

Not to rain on your birthday
parade Abs but Vegas?

That's not really your style.

And your basement is?

Hey I have foosball.

Good point.

Look this is my one and only
Sweet 16 birthday party.

I... I want it to be
spectacular.

I don't have anything to wear.

Well we both have
a free period right now.

Let's go buy you a dress.

We can't. The wasps are holding
my party money hostage.

I'll supply you the cash.

You'd do that?

Sure.

Jay you're the best.

We can't go.

I don't have my license yet.

A reading from the Wish List
of Abigail Jensen.

Wish number 7... When I'm 16...

Abigail Louise Jensen?

Yes.

This is highly unusual.

My driver's license!

And there ya go.

Thank you so much!

Oh lighten up Harry.

You needed to get out of
that cubicle anyway.

But we really don't
do this kind of thing.

I know.

But wasn't it fun?

My cubicle was fun.

â™ª My baby â™ª

â™ª Goin' for a ride â™ª

â™ª Ride and ride and ride â™ª

â™ª Ride and ride and ride... â™ª

Jay?
Yes Abs.

This is now officially
the best 16th birthday

in the history
of 16th birthdays.

Abby you can't afford
a hanger here.

Not true.

Since I don't have
to pay for my own party

I'm spending every penny I
saved on the perfect dress.

Come on!

What do you think?
It's nice.

No. Too disco.

What about this one?

You're... It's beautiful.

But do you think Logan
will like it?

How should I know?

Touchy.

Why don't you just light
No. 16 right now

and make the stupid wish?

Poof.
Logan Buchanan is yours.

It doesn't work that way.

Uh yes it does.

It's worked that way all day.

I want Logan to like me for me

not because I put some magic
birthday spell on him.

I'm trying this on.

And these.

I'll take these.

I really feel for you.

Wasting your time on kids
like that.

A customer's a customer.

Oh trust me.

They won't be buying anything.

Look Jay.
It's perfect isn't it?

Sure.

Well I love it and I think
Logan's going to love it too.

Good. Sold.

Can we go now?

Don't be so grumpy.

I'm sorry.

This is a store
not a playground.

Exactly.

I like this one.

I'm sure you do.

Why don't you kids just come
back with your parents?

We're not kids. I'm 16.

Congratulations.

Now give me the dress.

No we're buying it!

Jay show her your money.

My wallet... You out.

Hey!
You can't do that!

Watch me.

But we're customers!

No you're children.

Get that dress off now.

Wish number 9...

When I'm 16 people will
stop treating me like a kid.

When I'm 16 people will stop
treating me like a kid.

Um excuse me where's my friend?

There was a boy here

but he left with a girl in
the cutest little yellow car...

Wait. He left with Krista?

It appears so.

Turn around.

That outfit is all wrong.

It's far too young for you.

And suddenly really tight.

Let's get you into something
more age appropriate.

Let's try these.

But I don't have any money.

Oh we'll just put them
on your charge account.

I have a charge account?

Is everything all right

Oh yeah.

Everything is just fine.

Sorry Miss Duffy.

Do we know each other?

Yeah.

Ah you're the new
substitute teacher

which means I don't have to
babysit those little monsters.

They're all yours.

Psssst!

Psssst! Jay!

I'll be right back.

Oh great.

Leave me to wrangle
the Blob all alone.

Okay go.

Yes?

Get out here!

What's wrong with you?

Excuse me?

You left me stranded
on my birthday.

What kind of a best friend
does that?

Best friend?
What are you talking about?

Oh hi.
My name is Abby Jensen.

Have we met?

Yeah.
A long time ago I think.

Shut up.

Stop it.

I'm not your best friend.

I'm a sophomore.
You're a... woman.

Thank you but I'm just
four months older than you.

Yeah in dog years.

Listen I'm in the middle of
an important experiment...

And I'm in the middle of
an important birthday!

I'm sorry. I gotta go.

No wait... Let go.

Jay Kepler!

You're the worst
best friend ever!

I don't understand.

Am I being expelled?

I'm sure they'll
explain everything.

Mom? Dad?

What's the truck for?

Are we moving?

Just come with us.

Not until somebody tells me
what's going on?

Abby you can't go to
high school anymore.

What? Why not?

Because it's time you grow up.

Bob.
What?

Sweetheart while the
house is being fumigated

there just really
isn't room for you.

So your dad and I were talking...
We found you an apartment...

A what?

An apartment.

To live in.

By myself?

It's a very safe neighborhood.

Is that what you call it?

I call it pricey.

Your dad and I paid
the security deposit

but the first month's rent
is your responsibility.

Okay I'll get the last load.

You're going to need
a full-time job.

I circled some good ones...

What? No. I can't go
to school and have a job.

Oh well if you're ready
for college... Bob!

Yeah!

She wants to go to college!

No not yet!

Never mind.

Okay.

Mom I'm just a kid!

I can't live here by myself!

Abby don't be so dramatic.

Lots of girls your age
have their own apartments.

I moved out when I was 18.

But I'm not 18.

No you're 21.

22 today.

Happy Birthday sweetheart.

What are you talking about?

Let's go Sue.

No! Don't go!

Just remember we did this out
of love... Yeah tough love.

Bob!

You'll be fine Pumpkin.

Dad Dad...

Mom...
Come and visit anytime.

Except Wednesdays.

Wednesday is our bowling night.

High school memories?

No.

When I'm 16...

Let's get you into something
more age-appropriate.

You're the new substitute
teacher.

Stop it!
I'm not your best friend.

I'm a sophomore.

You're a...
woman.

No you're 21.

22 today.

Happy Birthday sweetheart.

Oh no.

No no no.

This isn't what I wanted!

Celeste!

Celeste I need to talk to you!

Right now!

The list.

There's gotta be a wish.

That's it! Wish number 3.

That should do it.

When I'm 16 I'll decorate
my room the way I want.

Yoo-hoo!

Decorator's Delight!

Celeste!
I'm so glad you're here... Me too.

Okay. Nice.

Lots of potential.

I need your help.
You sure do.

Maybe some wallpaper...
No no wallpaper.

Paint then.

Let's look at some samples.

No listen to me.

Your magic candles
made a mistake.

Candles don't make mistakes.

People do.

I made a wish but it
wasn't really my wish.

How about some curtains?

No!

Oo bad decision.

You need privacy.

You're alone.

You're a woman... No I'm not!

I'm not a woman!

I'm 16 years old!

I made a wish... wish number 9.

I didn't want to be an adult!

I just wanted to be
treated like one!

The candles have
their own logic.

They don't always give you
what you want.

Sometimes they give you
what you need.

And sweetie
you need drapes pronto.

I don't need drapes!

I need my life back!

I just wished away my friends

my Sweet 16 party
my senior prom...

I missed graduation!

I need to take that wish back!

Oh sweetie.

I'm afraid that's not possible.

The candles and your
wishes go together.

Since there's no do-over
wish on your list...

I'm afraid when midnight
comes this is your life.

But...

Decorator's Delight.

Uh-huh.

On my way.

Slipcover emergency.

Gotta run.

What? No no no!

Wait!

Celeste Celeste...

You tryin' to run out
on the rent?

No!
Good.

First month is due
in three days.

Pay up or move out.

Move out.

Move out.

Stupid wishes!

Why did I ever write you down!

I'll just change one.

Ha!

Gotcha!

I hate sushi and I always will!

Hey...

What about you
Wish No. 14?

When I'm 16...

There you are sweetheart.

Mom don't you ever knock?

I need privacy.

What?

I need privacy.

Hold on a minute.

Bob come here a minute.

Tell your dad.

I need privacy.

One more time.

I need privacy.
I need privacy.

I don't understand a word
she's saying. Do you?

No. Then again I never do.

This has to work.

Please understand.

Abby!
Hi Daddy.

Honey look who it is.

Hello sweetheart.
Hi Mom.

Shouldn't you be at your own
place unpacking those boxes?

Yeah but I missed you guys.

Aw that's sweet.

But we're kind
of busy right now.

Your turn dear.

What's the use?

22 cards in my hand
and I still can't play!

Can't this wait?

Of course it can.

What's up?

Well um...

I have something
important to discuss with you

and I thought if you really listen
to me you might understand.

Bob.

What? I'm listening.

We're listening.

Even if it sounds crazy?

I listen to your father
all the time.

What's that supposed to mean?

Go on sweetheart.

When I woke up this morning
I was 16 years old.

I thought this was going to be
the best day of my life.

Then this Birthday Fairy
appeared and gave me these.

Would you look at this hon.

Well that brings back
memories doesn't it?

What?
What memories?

Your father took me to the
Lucky Duck Chinese Restaurant

on the night you were born.

I had the orange chicken.

We thought it was an omen.

We always felt so lucky

to have a daughter as
wonderful as you are.

Really?

Really.

Then you'll understand when
I say I need to come back

and live with you
and go back to school..

I'm not ready to have my own
apartment and my own job.

Please tell me you understand.

Abby look behind you.

Ever since you were
a little girl

all you wanted was to be
exactly what you are now.

Beautiful and independent.

I remember the day
this photo was taken.

You wanted a grown-up
birthday party.

All dressed up in my
high heels and pearls.

You were never happier.

But being grown up is different
than dreaming about it isn't it?

Yes.

We understand you.

You do?

Of course.

You're scared your childhood
is over and with it

all the best times of your life.
Yes!

You probably want to just turn
back the clock and start over.

Yes! Yes!

That's exactly
what I want to do!

We know how that feels.

Then I'm still your
little girl?

You'll always be our
little girl Pumpkin...

Look! Wasps!

Time to go Pumpkin.

Drive safe.

And don't forget these.

But I thought you
guys understood.

We do understand Adulthood
could be tough.

Sometimes it gets
a little buggy.

Bye now sweetheart!

Love you!

So that's what that feels like.

Hi Logan.

Hey.

Cool ride.

Yeah you said that
this morning.

Huh?

So...what are you
doing here?

Party.

Right.

I wasn't invited.

Huh.

Hey!
Yeah?

Will you do something for me?
Sure.

Take a picture of me
with your car.

Okay.

Thanks.

It's what I want
when I'm your age.

There ya go.

Cool.

Oh man that's hot.

I can't wait to show Krista!

Joey Lockhart!

Get off of me!

Get off!

You have to believe me Jay.

You're my best friend and
it's my 16th birthday

and I got these magic
candles at the bus stop

and this big car pulled up
and Joey Lockhart got out

and kissed me... I don't know her.

You were there!
You saw him!

Let go.

Not until you listen to me.
Give me five minutes.

Four.

Okay.

I know this is hard to believe

but we're best friends
and I can prove it.

So?

Look at your key ring.

"Happy Sweet 16. Love Jay."

You gave this to
me this morning.

For my 16th birthday.

Abby.

You remember?

I think so.

So you believe me?

Yeah.

I do.

He believes me!

Whoa.

Volume.

This doesn't change anything.

And when midnight comes
I'm stuck like this forever.

Here lemme see the list.

Here ya go.

Okay you've used 1 2
7 8 9... Skip ahead.

I can't believe
you wasted a wish on sushi.

I was 8.

I had a very
unsophisticated palate.

Had?

You're a great best friend Jay.

I know.

C'mon.

Most of these are
kind of useless

since you're already an adult.

That leaves 15 and Logan
Buchanan... Yeah about that...

15 was always my favorite.

"When I'm 16 I'll have
the best party ever."

But you're not 16 anymore.

Hey.

I kinda have to make an
appearance at Krista's party.

Do you maybe want to come
with me?

Not as my date or anything.

No.

Of course not.

Well?

I'd love to go with you Jay.

Okay.

Great party.

Ladies first.

Mike?

Give a shout-out to my
big sis Abby everybody.

You're super old Abs
but you're still cool!

So Mike can really play?

Yeah.

Something just clicked
with him this year.

He got serious about
playing guitar.

He's getting paid really
well for this gig.

Wait.

Did I miss something?

I mean besides senior year?

Jay you're here!

Hi! I'm so glad
you could make it!

Yeah.

I'm...Abby Jensen.

I know silly.

We're neighbors?

Yes.
Neighbors.

Your party looks awesome.

Thanks to your parents.

They found all these amazing
decorations in their garage

after their house
was infested by wasps.

I guess they were left over
from your Sweet 16 Party

but never got used
for some reason.

So they just gave them to me!

Lucky you.

I know right?

And you're just in time
for the big celebration.

Thanks for coming everybody!

Man this is a dream
come true for me.

What's happening?

Jay Kepler
ladies and gentlemen.

Our new Student Body President!

Thank you.

I want to recognize my campaign
manager Krista Cook.

What all of you don't know is
that I really wanted this

but I was too afraid to try.

I couldn't have done it
without your help Krista.

Thank you so much!

1 2 3 4...
Have fun okay? Mm-hmm.

So you're Student Body
President?

Yep.

I was Student Body President.

Oh yeah.

Weird.

I thought with me out of the
way Krista would win for sure.

Krista?

She's hates competition.

Krista?

Our Krista.

Yeah.

I think without you in her life

she just didn't have a reason
to compete for anything.

She's kind super helpful a good
listener and a great friend.

You guys would like each other.

If y'know you were
the same age right?

â™ª Look around it's dead of night â™ª

â™ª You've been losing every fight â™ª

â™ª Your hope is feeling broken â™ª

â™ª Your feet are rough â™ª

â™ª They're scraped and bruised â™ª

â™ª But still have strength
to take you through â™ª

â™ª Into the dawn â™ª

â™ª Just close your eyes â™ª

This was supposed
to be my party.

â™ª ...and push right through â™ª

â™ª I know it's tough right now â™ª

â™ª This was meant for you â™ª

â™ª When the clouds are gone â™ª

â™ª Not a shadow in sight â™ª

â™ª You'll be drenched in the sun
with open eyes â™ª

â™ª Oh oh oh... â™ª

â™ª Oh oh oh... â™ª

â™ª Now at the beach the waves still crash â™ª

â™ª The tide can grab and pull you back â™ª

â™ª And the sun may be covered in gray â™ª

â™ª The sand will itch the salt can burn â™ª

â™ª The hurricane will take its turn â™ª

â™ª Until the dawn â™ª

â™ª Just close your eyes and push
right through â™ª

â™ª I know it's tough right now â™ª

â™ª This was meant for you â™ª

â™ª When the clouds are gone â™ª

â™ª Not a storm in sight â™ª

â™ª You'll be drenched in the sun â™ª

â™ª With open eyes â™ª

â™ª So close your eyes shut them tight â™ª

â™ª Let it be and it will fade away â™ª

â™ª Fade away â™ª

â™ª Let it be and it will fade away â™ª

â™ª Push on through there's strength in you â™ª

â™ª Let it be and wish it all away â™ª

Large pepperoni pineapple
for Jensen.

I didn't order a pizza.

I know.

I just thought
you could use a friend.

Oh sweetie.

Dry those tears.

I'm starving.

You are?

Sure us magical beings
have to eat too.

This day didn't go
like I thought it would.

I can't believe I wasted
my wishes on things

like beating Krista Cook.

Yeah.

She's pretty nice now that she
is not out to destroy you.

Don't rub it in.

She's a really good friend
to Jay.

Better than I was.

I didn't even know he wanted
to be Student Body President.

How could I have been
so thoughtless?

All I could think about

was having parties and
clothes and popularity.

I can't believe those things
were so important to me.

You were 16.

But I didn't appreciate it.

Ever since I was little
I wanted to grow up.

I thought it was the only way
to get what I wanted.

I guess I didn't realize
what I already had.

You still have
this little number.

Wish 16.

All those years I saved it
for something really special.

Of all the wishes on this list

this is the one
I wish I could change.

Wow that gum is still
really fresh.

Maybe the rules
don't know about gum.

There's only one way
to find out.

I wish I could start
this whole day over again.

Surprise!

Happy Birthday Abby.

Look.

Your first 16th
birthday picture.

This is a great picture!

This is the best picture I've
ever seen in my entire life!

Thank you thank you thank you!

You're welcome Pumpkin.

Make a wish sweetheart?

I wish for exactly this.

Everything is perfect.

Wasps!

Yeah.

I saw one crawl up the AC vent.

No not one. Thousands!

Nesting up there for 16 years!

Sweetheart we know.

No you don't know.
You can't possibly know

that the house is going
to be totally infested

and the wasps will
take over the cars

and you and Dad'll have
to live in the driveway

but then Joey Lockhart
will come and kiss me

and I will get candles
and wishes

and some really
gorgeous clothes

and everything will look
like it will be okay.

But then I will make
a really stupid wish

that I didn't mean to make

and I will have to grow up and
live alone and miss my party

and this will turn into
the worst 16th birthday

in the history of
16th birthdays!

You have to call
the exterminator now!

Okey dokey.

All done.

Whoo that was some wasps' nest.

Celeste?

Hi Abby.

You know her.

Yeah we just met this morning.

When Abby called me.
You're very lucky I showed up when I did.

So the wasps are all gone.

Like they never happened.

Everything is going to be okay?

Better than okay.

Wait.
What do I owe ya?

Consider it a Sweet 16 gift.

Happy Birthday Abby.

Thank you.

For everything.

Go on down and start making that
special birthday breakfast

you have planned for me Mom.

I'll be right there.

â™ª Da na na da na na now! â™ª

â™ª Da na na da na na now! â™ª

Hey!

This is for you.

I was saving it
for my Sweet 16 party

but I think you need it more.

Whoa!

For what?

A real guitar.

I think you're really talented.

Thank you Abs.

I love you Mike.

Thanks for the yummy
breakfast Mom and Dad.

Love you!

Love you too.

Krista! Krista! Wait!

Get back.

We need to talk.

I have nothing to say to you.

I have one quick question.

No you cannot have a ride.

I don't want a ride.

I want to understand.

What did I ever do to you?

Go away.

No.

Not until you answer me.

Why don't you like me?

You really don't know do you?

Not a clue.

It was in third grade.

Jay and I were best friends.

Then you moved to town.

It was my birthday.

Jay and I made a pact...

Cheese!

Best friends forever!

Yeah!

I stole your best friend.

On my birthday.

After that Jay and I
did everything together.

Without me.

That must have been
so horrible for you.

It was.

I can't imagine how you felt.

How I felt?

I felt like a loser.

Krista if I could turn back
the clock and change that day

I would.

I am so sorry.

You are?

Any chance you can forgive me?

I don't know.

I made my own vow that day.

Which was...
I vowed to win at everything

so you'd never get anything
you wanted ever again.

Wow.

You did a great job.

Thank you.

Hey imagine if you used your
powers for good instead of evil.

Like what?

Do you really want to be
Student Body President?

Honestly?

No.

It's exhausting having
to win all the time.

If you want to drop out

I know somebody who would
love to take your place.

Hey Krista.

Hey Abby!

Boys.

Cool ride!

Thanks!

Weird.

You're a terrible best friend.

No I'm not.
Yes you are.

I had to take the bus by myself.
Where were you?

I got a ride.

You two.
In one vehicle.

And it didn't like explode?

Nope.

We have a surprise for you.

Why? It's not my birthday.

No it's mine...
And mine...

And all we want is for
your dream to come true.

What dream?

You're now the only person running
for Student Body President.

So you'll win for sure.

Think so?

Absolutely.

Jay Kepler
ladies and gentlemen.

Our new...
Student Body President!

Go Jay!

Thanks everybody.

Let's hear it for the hosts
of this little party

Abby and Krista!

Huh?

You really like him don't you?

Making you suffer was a bonus but
I would have liked him anyway.

Well I happen to know
he really likes you too.

Really?
Really.

Go talk to him.

About what?

Ask him about the red sports
car he wants to drive someday.

Okay.

That's okay keep going.

When I'm 16 I will have my
own car preferably red.

You don't get that wish.

I didn't know what it was.

Jensen!

Wha...bltha...hello?

Bye now sweetheart.

Ow!

Hold on guys!

I will get you to school

I can't keep my eyes open.

Yup still going.

Ahhhh!

Who's the cutest?

Me!

Okay I got it.

What?
