You're romantic.

You know what I mean?

Besides, you just give

About sex, about romance...

A pretty girl

who she can't see...
silly questions...

and based on their answers...

she picks one to date,

That's it.
That's the show.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

CHUCK: Well, he led

BARRIS: Hooten-fuckin'-nanny.

PENNY: What do they know?

Probably about 70 to you and me.


It's nine years

Uh-huh.

I'm sorry about your show.

Jesus, Phoebe, that's...

Yeah. No, I'll hold on.

Is that your mom?
My sister.

Come here. Oh, yeah.
I got you these.

Listen, Pen, I'm not...

I want to tell you something.
I talked to a psychic today.

A what?
A psychic.

And she said that you are
gonna be very successful.

Oh, really?
Mery successful.

Tea leaves.

Say that again, Phoebe.
I missed it.

Tuvia? No, why would I

She did?
Who's Tuvia?

Oh, your niece.

Ha ha ha:

I'm back in town for a while,
and I thought maybe...

TUMIA: Jesus,

CHUCK: We could go out
and get an ice cream cone.

He's so convincing
when he's... Heh heh...

when he's talkin' with you...

he could convince you
of anything, you know?

He's one of
the very few guys...

I'd like to have on my side
in a street fight.

CHUCK: You wanna fight,
you big pile of shit?


[Grunting and shouting]

You're a pretty angry
young fella.

Can't fight worth a damn,
though.

CHUCK: Hey. Scnew off. Queen.

Don't tlink I laven't seen you

in tlat ban fon a week now.

Kind of a loner, I'd say.

Fairly bright,
a tad antisocial.

Mad at the world.
Can I buy you lunch?

a schoolyard half a block down.

Why don't you go trollin' there?

JIM: I can teach you
at least 30 different ways...

to kill a man with
a single blow, Mr. Barris.

It might help
in future bar fights.

Just a thought.

Oh, and there's money in it...
good money.

CHUCK: I figure
if I can keep afloat...

until I come up with
the next game show idea...

then all would be copacetic.

That sounds great, Chuck.

I've never known
a television producer before.

I'm impressed.


What's this money and a deal
you were talking about?

JIM: I work
for a government agency.

We're always looking for good,
enthusiastic men...

to help us carry out
our directives.

What kind of work?
What government agency?

Problem-solving work.

The Office
of Diplomatic Security.

I never heard of it.

Is that the fuckin' CIA
or something?

Ha ha ha ha ha:

JIM: Please be discreet,
Mr. Barris.


Is this the fuckin' CIA?

Yeah. Hell, I'll be a spy.

Where do I sign up?
Are you fuckin' with me?

You're fuckin' with me,
aren't you?

JIM: Hardly.

And you wouldn't be working
for the company.

You'd be an independent
contract agent.

Independent.

No official tie to any agency.

Understand?

Why me?

Well, as you know,
I've been watching you.

For quite some time, actually.

I've only let you know about it
for the last week.

I'm happy to report
you fit our profile, Mr. Barris.

Are you interested in the work?

What's the profile?

JIM: Are you interested
in the work, Mr. Barris?

Yeah, sure.
I wanna be a secret agent.

A contract agent, whatever.

Get to fuck beautiful
Eastern European women...

What we do is very serious,
Mr. Barris.

It's essential in quelling
the rise of communism...

and allowing democracy
to get its rightful foothold...

around the globe.

You understand?

Uh... sure.

Yeah, uh...

Yeah, OK. That's good.

I'm not killin' people.
My future's in television.

You're 32 years old,
and you've achieved nothing.

Jesus Christ was dead
and alive again by 33.

You better get crackin'.

I have ideas for shows.
Good.

Why don't you spend another
six months developing them...

while you're staring

How do you know all this?

I know everything

I know which hand

I'm here to tell you, this is

You're making

Umm... mmy daddy is Welsl...

mmy mmamma's Hunganian...

so I guess
that makes me well-hung.


Baclelon nummben two...

I play the trombone.

If I blew you,

BACHELOR NUMBER TWO:
Wlat would I sound like?


All niglt. Ool.

Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

Ool. Ool.

Ool. Ool. Ool.

Ool.

Tlat's nice. Don't stop. OI.

[lmitates trombone]

Blow it. Baby.

[lmitates trombone
playing shakily]

[Shoes squeak]

CHUCK: Heh heh.

Chuck, quite frankly,
these episodes are unairable.

CHUCK: Look, Larry,
the show's spontaneous.

It's unscripted.
That's its charm.

I can't help what people say.

HANK: Be that as it may,
we can't have black men...

getting blow jobs
on national television:

The point is not
that he's black, Hank.

HANK: Well. I know tlat.

GOLDBERG: Cluck. Tlat's it.
We can't ain tlis stuff.

If you can't netain
youn spontaneity on tle slow...

witlout tlis lewd conduct.
it's oven.

It's finisled.
You'ne listony.

Now, fix this fucking thing,
or we got a problem.

Hi, folks.
Before we begin taping today...

I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Peter Jenks...

of the Federal
Communications Commission.

OK?

Thank you, Mr. Barris.

I don't know if any of you
are aware of this...

but it's a federal offense...

to make lascivious remarks...

on a television
network broadcast.

The penalty...

for this disgusting...

un-American... behavior...

is one year in prison...

or a $10,000 fine...

or both:

Anyone...

making a sick subversive
remark tonight...

will be arrested immediately.

l, then,
will personally escort...

the offender
to federal prison...

for booking
under edict number 364...

of the Broadcasting Act
of 1963.

And it's a long drive
to that prison, baby.

Just you and me.

No witnesses:

CHUCK:
OK. Lave fun. Evenybody.

All niglt.

They gave everybody jackets
with their names on them...

and when we got number one
ratings on Saturday nights...

everybody got a gold plaque.

And so, he was a good boss...

and obviously
had the common touch...

because he really knew
what people wanted to watch.

BARRIS: We ained
and becamme a big lit.

A plenommenon. Neally.

CHUCK: Hey, baby.

I got a story to tell you.

Asshole.
I know, I know.

Uhh. I got
a little story for you.

LORETTA: I'm busy.
We're in the middle...

of a bachelorette crisis
out there.

CHUCK: Sit down, relax.

Take a load off.
Make yourself at home.

I just got a call
from the network.

You want a drink?
You got any weed?

CHUCK: I wisl. No. No weed.

Then I'll have a drink.

[Chuck sighs]

LORETTA: Bad news?

"The Tammy Grimes Show" is being
pulled from Saturday night.

Oh, not Tammy.
Ha ha ha ha.

They want me to put
a primetime version...

of "The Dating Game"
on in its place.

That's fucking great.
Yeah, it's great...

but they say the daytime version
is not hot enough.

They want me to make it
more exciting for nighttime.

I got 48 hours.

LORETTA: Wlat lave you got?


I don't have a clue.
I got nothing. Bupkus.

Tlis is a big deal. Lonetta.
My big bneak.

I know. [Exhales]

Don't blow it.
Oh, thanks for the help.


[Slow jazz music playing]

JIM: Let me
ask you something, Chuck.

Jesus. What the...
What are you doing here?

JIM:
I've been put in clange...

of a fainly lange
wet openation...

and I could use youn lelp.


Have you noticed, Jim?
I got a TM show on the air.

I don't need to kill people
for hire anymore.

I know you don't need to,
but you like to.

Bullshit.

Think of it as a hobby...
something you do to relax.

You can be
an assassination enthusiast...

a murder bug.

I got important things
to think about here.

I don't have time
to fuck around with you.

This is serious work
we're talking about, Chuck...

serious work.

How about I help you out
with your little show...

you help me out
with my little operation?

Tit for tat.
That's the kind of guy I am.

Oh, yeah.
You're a piece of work.

I've seen this "Dating Game"
of yours, Chuck...

and I do have a thought.

What, now you're
a big television producer?

JIM: I'm John Q. Public
when it comes to TM...

and that should make my opinion
of value to you.

CHUCK: All right,
let's hear it, then.

JIM: What do you have?
Some couple gets sent...

to some second-rate
shit-can restaurant...

setting you back 50 bucks?

That's not
too exciting a prize...

for us vicarious living boobs
out in TM land.

What's your point?
Up the stakes, Chuck.

Send them
to some exotic locale...

Europe, Southeast Asia,
for example.

The network's not going
to let me send...

two unmarried kids
on vacation together.

JIM: Send them with a chaperone.

CHUCK: That's...

That's not half bad.

JIM: I'm telling you.

Sometimes you could be
the chaperone.

Say we have a job
for you in Austria.

You, a successful
television producer...

chaperones a young couple.

While there, you take care
of some company business.

It's a perfect cover.

TM producer by day,
CIA operative at night.

I got money, Jim.

I don't have to kill people
for money anymore.

Chuck, when I said
you fit the profile...

very little of that meant
you needed the money.

You liked it with Renda.
I saw it in your eyes.

You liked it,
but you botched it.

You could be
a great warrior, Chuck.

BACHELORETTE:
Baclelon nummben tlnee...

if we wene fixed up
on a date...

and I ignoned you...

DIRECTOR: This guy's
never been on a date.

[Snaps fingers]
Ready, four. Take four.

Well. I'mm not used
to being ignoned...

but I would...
I'd give you youn space.

The only date this guy's
had is with his right hand.

[Both laugh]

Ready, one. Take one.

[Audience laughing]

Bachelor number three,
what if I pick you...

DIREC TOR:
God. Sle's going fon tle tlnee.

Ready. Foun. Take foun.
[Snaps fingens]

The only way
that you could be ugly...

is by what you say or do.

I don't know.
From where I'm sitting...

I think you're beautiful.

DIREC TOR: I can't believe it.

BACHELORETTE:
Baclelon nummben tlnee...

Well... l'll ask her
what she likes to do...

and if she doesn't know what
she likes to do...

then I'll know
she hasn't done it yet.


[Game show music playing]

BACHELOR NUMBER THREE:
Wly don't you talk to len?

You can do tlat.
Sle's neal sly.

You lave to tell len.
Tlat's younjob.

Tell her that I think
she's real pretty...

and I want
to be her boyfriend.

I'm shy, too.

You got to tell her that, Chuck.

I used to skate
when I was young.

I told her that.
She didn't even look at me.

You got to talk to her, Chuck.
It's your job.

She picked me,
not those other guys.

You're the chaperone, Chuck.

She called me gay.

I'm not gay.
You got to tell her that.

You're not doing your job
very well.

I mean,
I know it takes time...

for people to get
to know each other...

but this is ridiculous.

They thought he was...

They sort of walked
a straight line...

because they used to talk
about him...

saying, you know,
"This guy, he can turn on you."

You know,
and I never saw that side...

but a lot of the crew thought
he could turn on them.

Chuck?

[Slow jazz music playing]

JIM: Helsinki is wondenful
tlis timme of yean.

Especially tle snow.

It affonds one solitude...

even in a city full of people.

Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

By you.


Helsinki is wonderful
this time of year, isn't it?

Yes, it is.

Oh, I'm sorry. Um...

Excuse me.

Helsinki is wonderful
this time of year, isn't it?

Especially the snow.
It affords one solitude...

even in a city full of people.

Hey...

I'm Chuck. Ahem.

So I gathered.

CHUCK: And you are?

Here you are, Chuck.

At least give me
a made-up name...

something for me to cry out...

during those dark nights
of the soul.

Cry out, "Olivia."

That's "Twelfth Night."

Mery good, Chuck.

I'm pleasantly surprised.

You're not like
the other murderers.

[Dramatic music playing]

MAN: Hene.

CHUCK: Do you have it?

Do you have it?
Oh, sorry.

CHUCK: Don't worry.
We're not going to cheat you.

Chuck?

[Music fades]

[Exhaling, whistling]


[Beethoven's
"Moonlight Sonata" playing]

CHUCK: Olivia?

It's Patricia, actually.

PATRICIA: So. Tlen I spent
a yean in Openation: Claos...

inside the anti-war movement...

nudging it towards violence
to discredit it.

That was fun.

CHUCK: It sounds fun.

So, tell me, Patricia,
why did you come here tonight?

Ahem.

I don't know.

You're kind of cute
in a homely sort of way, and...

It's lonely when
the civilian you're fucking...

calls out the name
on your fake passport.

CHUCK: All the information
I have about myself...

is from forged documents.

Nabokov.

[Glass shatters]

[Objects clatter]

Wait, wait.

I got to go into the bathroom
and take care of something.

Leave the microfilm in, baby.

OK. See you, Chuck. Bye.

JIM: Cluck.

You don't look too good.

Mr. Barris, do not ever again
jeopardize one of my missions...

by having a game show contestant
standing around as a witness.

Is that understood?
You're welcome, pal.

Do I make myself clear?

Fuck you.
They're my contestants.

You are a bloody amateur.

You're a faggot.
Chuck.

OLIVER: Tell mme. Mn. Bannis.

Yeah, I got it.
Let's have it, then.

Don't distract me.

[Music playing faintly]

I think

and we've fucked

And you think I'm cute,

And you always come to me

right after this message.

You know what the sad part
about it is...

Barris has a reputation...

for lowering
the bar of television...

and the standards and all...

but he had a great feel
for what people wanted...

and he couldn't take
the criticism.

BARRIS: Tlings stanted

[Woman laughs]

Well, I'm glad to meet you.
I've seen "The Gong Show."

Oh. Yeah, well...

I think you're the most
insidious, despicable force...

in entertainment today.

How dane you subject
tle nest of tle wonld...

to your loathsome views
of humanity?

Yeah... I don't think
it's that loathsome.

What is it, then?

To mock some
poor lonely people...

who are just craving a little
attention in their lives...

to destroy them?

I mean, they're still people.

Tley still desenve a little

Oh, that's right.
You created "The Dating Game."

How's show biz?

Well, it's hit and miss.

I got a new show called
"Operation: Entertainment"...

which I believe
is really, really gonna kill.

It's sort of a Bob Hope
visiting the troops thing...

but it's weekly.

Instead of Bob Hope,
it's like Flip Wilson...

Chuck. Tch.

Why do you do what you do?

Hmm?

I like to think that
I bring joy and laughter...

to millions of people.

It's a very important thing,
I think...

in these difficult times.

I'm not saying the show is
as good as it can be yet...

but, uh...

KEELER: No. No.

Wly do we do wlat we do?

Hmmmm? [Laugls] Comme on.

I got my feet wet
in World War II.

Germany.

The pleasure of killing
was exhilarating.

Later in life, I...

couldn't find a place
to fill that void...

to get that
same rush of energy.

So I started up
my own business.

"Whatsoever your hand

"do it gladly...

"because there is no work,

"or wisdom in the grave."

Who is that, Carlyle?

No, it's the Old Testament.

It's God.

It's amazing
you should quote him.

He's my hero.

Killing my first man...

Hello?

You were supposed to meet me
at the Palm two hours ago.

Oh, fuck, I forgot.
You forgot. Really?

Keeler's dead. Did you know?
Yeah, I heard.

What did you hear?
I heard he took himself out.

Is that right?
Did Byrd tell you that?

He said he was depressed.
I was gonna tell you, but... Hey:

Who is this?

I don't get stood up.
Do you understand?

Fun: Excuse me.

[Both laugh]

So glad... Penny. Patricia.
How'd you find me?

Are you serious?
This is what I do for a living.

What does she mean?

You're dead in my book,
strawberry dick.

Strawberry dick?
I'll see you around.

Nice to meet you, Penny.
I've heard a lot about you.

Why don't you stay
for a cocktail?

Penny...

And... and... you know, man...

I'm giving you
one more chance. Get it?

This really is the hardest part
of the job for me.

CHUCK:
Tley killed mmy babies...

I pushed them into the world...

through the birth canal
of my imagination...

Iovingly... tenderly.

Where's the humanity
of these people? Huh?

Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em.

They're fucking bastards anyway.

Yeah. What am I gonna do now?

WOMAN: Oh, baby.

Oh, yeah. Feels so good.

PENNY: Cluck?

CHUCK: Sle's. Ul...

PENNY: Tlis is oun louse.

It's one tling to go elsewlene
fonyoun pussy needs.

But tlis is oun louse.

It's my house, Pen.

It's our house.

I found it with you.
I decorated it with you.

I spent six fucking months...

waiting for the fucking plumber
to fucking come.

CHUCK: I'mm sonny.

You're such an asshole.

[Starts engine]

No, I'm not saying that.
That's not what I'm saying.

PENNY: Then what
are you saying, Chuck?


around or not?

Do you even like me?

Of course I like you.

Penny...

How much?
What?

I need to know
how much you like me.

I don't know what that means.

How much? How can I rate
a person in that way?

You could if you felt it.

If you felt it,
it would be easy.

You would just...


spread your arms
as wide as they would go...

and say, "This much, Penny."


Everything's complicated, Pen.

You know, nothing's
black and white like that.

Do you want me around or not?

Because if you don't, it's OK.
Just tell me.

Hey, hey...

I love you, Penny, in my way.

Maybe not in that crazy
head-over-heels thing...

but what is that anyway?

Romantic love...

isn't that just an illusion?

You just said
you loved me, right?

JIM: Hi, Chuck.

Hey, Jim, what do you want?

How's work?
Great.

Any new game show ideas?

Dozens. Why are you here, Jim?

We need you to find the mole
and take him out.

Yeah.


Yeal...
I'mm done killing people.

I just want
to ententain people.

I'mm out.

No, you're not.

Hey, I got an idea.

If you want him so bad...

why don't you do it?

Why don't you kill the mole?

Any problem with killing, Jim?

I just don't fit the profile.

What fucking profile?
There is no fucking profile.

OK. There's no profile.

There's no profile.
OK.

You had a twin sister,
stillborn...

strangled

I'm trying to think of

but you have me at a bit
of a disadvantage, Chuck.

I don't have your files

Come on, Jim.

I'm out.

As long as the mole's alive,
you're a dead man.

How do I know it's not you?

You're a fairly bright guy.

You'll figure it out.

[Knock on door]

Well...

Iook who comes out of hiding.

CHUCK: I started thinking,
Trish, you're the only woman...

in the world
who really... who really knows me.

I know I screwed you over
in the past...

and I'm sorry. I...

[Piano concerto plays]

I just want you
to know that...

I hate myself for how...

Goddamn, I hate myself
for how I lived, Trish.

PATRICIA: Nietzscle says
wloeven despises oneself...

still respects oneself
as one who despises.

CHUCK: Shit,
I never thought of that.

I can't even despise myself
with any insight.

The insane asylums
are filled with people...

who think
they're Jesus or Satan.

Mery few have delusions
of being...

a guy down the block who works
for an insurance company.

All right.

What is this stuff?

I wanted to be a writer once.

I wanted to write something...

that someday some lesser person
would quote...

but I never did.

I'm the lesser person, Trish.

I never say
anything meaningful...

that wasn't said
by somebody else first.

I am disposable.

I disposed of people,
and I'm disposable.

I've been thinking about you
a lot lately, Chuck.

Oh, yeah?
Mmm.

I've missed you.

You could have fooled me.

Well, I've mellowed.


Boston is a beautiful city.

We could start over here,
normal life together.

Sell insurance.


Yeah: That sounds good.
That sounds right.

Look at that.

I could learn to love
that skyline.

Did you see
I got your picture framed?

Oh, yeah? Where?

Look.
Oh, hot dog:

To life.

To life.

You devil. Isn't that sweet?

Oh...

Hey, what about splitting
our time in New York?

Fuck. I just bit...

It's just a... [Gags]


[Gasping, grunting]

PATRICIA: No, that's too quick.

You're supposed to get to
the bathroom and throw up first.

God, Chuck, you should have
seen Oliver's face.

It was just... well...
if I do say so myself.

I got a nice snapshot of it,
actually.

Mmm...

You know, Keeler was easy.

Traveled halfway around
the world for a night with me.

Hmm...

[Chuck panting]

OK... Let's see...

Chuck, you've put on weight.

Come on.

I nearly blew it with Byrd.

Never farm out a job
that you should do yourself.

Do you want a laugh?
He thought you were the mole.

He was going to kill you.
What an idiot.

"I'm not at all the person
you and I took me for."

Hmm. Sounds like an epitaph.

Your handwriting, too.

You see, Chuck,
I save everything.

All of your lovely notes.
Mmm.

[Labored breathing]

You know what?

I like Carlyle best, too.

I really do. Yeah.

Say hi to the boys
when you see 'em.

Ooh...

Oh...
