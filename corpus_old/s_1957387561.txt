(hum of traffic)

(jackhammer clanging)

(soft snoring)



(flushes toilet)

Hi, Mom.

No, everything's fine.

(clears throat)

Yeah.

I was just thinking
about that cabin

that Uncle Andy used
to take us to when I was a kid.

Do they still own that?

What are you doing this week?

(tired grunt)

I don't know, nothing.

Great.

We're gonna leave.

Where are we goin'?

It's this beautiful old cottage
in the middle of the woods.

I used to go there
for holidays

and sometimes
in the summer.

Does your uncle
still live there?

No, he never lived there.

He just owns it.

So it's like
a real summer home.

Yeah.

It's kind of weird
to think about now, right?

Hm, must be nice.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Since we rare â™ª

â™ª Still over here
like I'm meant to be there, â™ª

â™ª but I'm right where I want â™ª

â™ª Our execution is styled â™ª

â™ª if you stare
when they watch me stunt â™ª

â™ª I want the earth
in my lungs, â™ª

â™ª but I feel like
I'm breathing in Hell â™ª

â™ª Ain't no such thing
as too much... â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Ayo, take this exit
right here.

Why?
I want to see somethin'.

It'll be worth it.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(camera clicks)

The Midwest ain't shit
but a straight line.


But it does get pretty
sometimes.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

We're almost there.

Awesome, 'cause I need
to crap so bad.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

This is it?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Mm, no...

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

What do you mean?

(crickets chirring)

But why would they renovate it?

Look, I can't...

Why would they do that?

That's bullshit.

What's goin' on?

They tore down
the old cottage,

and then they built this.

Thought your uncle
didn't even come here anymore.

They're gonna rent it out
as a vacation home.

Oh...

I'm sorry, that sucks.

Yeah! It does suck.

You still wanna stay?

Yeah.

We'll stay.

(birds chirping)

(item rustling)

(water flowing)

(branch cracks)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(cattle bellowing)

Looks like
someone's burning something.

How far does
your uncle's land extend?

I don't know.

Pretty far,
from what I can remember.

Nature is so... big.

For real.

I'm tired.

(sleeping bags rustling)

Look!

Hm?

(crickets chirring)

Wow.

Come on.

Let's go.

Come on.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Hey.

Hey.

Do you wanna fuck?

Do you mind
if we didn't tonight?

I'm really tired.

Okay.

(distant sounds
of nocturnal creatures)

(coyote howls)

(owl hoots)


(door opens)

(abundant nature sounds)

Do you want me
to make you a PB and J?

Who... what... what is this?

Hello.

Who are you?

I'm a person.

You don't look like a person.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

That's hurtful.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I wanted to say hello to Brynn.

Wait, what the fuck?

You know her?

Yes.
How?

It's been a long time.

Yo, what the fuck
is he talkin'...

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Hey.

Hey. Are you okay?

I can come back later.

Hey, you want to take
that fuckin' mask off?

This is my face.

Hey, mask man,
you gotta go.

Okay, I'll... I'll leave.

I'm sorry.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Hey, let's get you to
lie down, all right? Come on.

(soft, escalating
whooshing sound)

Maybe he really left.

Maybe.

He said
he was coming back though.

Yeah.

It knew your name.

Did you tell that thing
your name?

No, he acted like he knew me.

That freaked me out
even more than how he looked.

You sure
you didn't ever, like,

hang out with cults
or something, like,

when you were a kid?

No. I don't think so.

Might be some
repressed memories.

Shut up.

Oh, God.

Here we go.

Hello.

What do you want, man?

I want to talk to Brynn.

Yeah, well, she doesn't
want to talk to you.

No, it's okay.
It's fine.

Are you all right?

Yeah.

You seemed disturbed.

I was.

You scared me.

Why?

You're... scary.

You don't remember me?

No.

It's been a long time,

but I thought
you were here to see me.

I'm sorry, I don't mean
to hurt your feelings.

I just don't know
what you're talking about.

I understand.

Hey, man, um,
what are you supposed to be?

What am I?

Yeah, with the mask
and the woods and everything.

What's your species,
your name?

There's no need
to name things in nature.

To identify
a natural thing

is like addressing
a ripple of water.

So you don't have a name.

When you were here before,

you decided
my name was Rue.

You can call me that
if you want.

Rue?
Yeah.

Okay.

I'm Laika.

I'm sorry,
this is my boyfriend Laika.

Are you in love?

Yeah.
Sure.

I have to go now.

Okay.

(crickets chirring)

I'll pour it.
No, I'll pour it.

That's... that's enough,
that's enough!

Mm.

(video plays on phone)

Hey, guys, if I get a million
likes on this video,

I will eat this bagel,
I swear to God!

Oh, my God.

Hi.

Hey.

Damn, whiskey makes
you smell so good.

(agreeable moan)

No.

I don't really feel good.


I'm sorry.

Uh... are you okay?

No.

Oh, do you need anything?

No, I don't need anything.

I'm fine, obviously.

Whoa, hey.

It's a joke.


Hey.

It was a joke.

(vomiting, coughing)

(fire crackling)

I think Rue left a gift for ya.

What's this?

That was nice of him.

You want to do anything today?

I don't know.

Well, actually,
we could go on a picnic.

We could do that.

Yeah, I wanna go on a picnic.

Where do you think he lives?

I don't know.

The woods or something.

(Brynn laughs)

Yeah, but is it, like,
a house or a hut or a treehouse?

I think he lives in, like,
a interdimensional hammock.

What?

What the hell is an
interdimensional hammock?

It's like a hammock that exists
between two parallel universes.

Oh, right.

Come on.

I just hope he don't pop up
out of nowhere anymore.

So, do you, like, eat food?

Not really.

Word.

(hawk cries)

What do you do in the woods?

I make sure that things grow.

Like a... like a groundskeeper?

I don't really know
what that is,

but I think so.

You take care of the woods.

Yeah.

So where are you from, man?

I've always been here.

How long is that?

I couldn't say.

Nature doesn't keep track
of time.

That's not true.

Trees have rings.

Mammals know
when it's winter or spring.

Laika...

I'm just saying.

It's not like
nature's some void

where nothing means anything.

That's not what I meant.

That's what it sounded like.

Say what you mean.

I'm sorry.

I wasn't trying to be a dick.

I didn't think anything of it.

Why are you being
that way to him?

Like what?

You're kind of being an asshole.

Am I?

Yeah, you are.

You're being a dick,
starting fights.

He's a weird dude.

He says weird things.

So I'm not weird?

You're not weird?

What's so weird about him?

He doesn't believe in time.

And he says he's known you
since you were a kid.

And you don't remember
any of it.

That's weird.
That's a weird thing.

Just don't think
you're being very nice.

I don't understand why
you're being nice at all.

Because I'm a nice person.

Are you?

What the fuck does that mean?

You can be a bitch.

Like in a good way.

That's our whole dynamic.

You're a bitch,
I'm an asshole.

That's our thing.

Sorry I'm not being enough
of a bitch for you.

Jesus.
You know what I mean*.

You know what, that... that...
that doesn't make any sense.

I'm taking a walk.

Ow, shit!

Fuck!


(water rushing)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(water trickling)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Hey, it's Vera.

I was... I was just callin'
to see how you're doin'.

And it just seems like
you kind of disappeared

these past few months, so...

Yeah, well,
I hope things are going well.

And... call me back
if you want, okay?

All right, bye.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(door slams)


Fuckin' weird shit.

This is you?

What?

You've been burning the fires?

We noticed them
when we first got in.

Yes.

How come?

Just for warmth?

Mostly.

Okay.

Come on.

I'll show you something great.

â™ª Ready to stop when you are â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª I'm ready to stop
when you are, yeah â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Yeah â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Yeah â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Do you know
how you were born?

I don't really know
where I came from,

but I know I had a family.

I remember that.

You do?

Yeah.

I just had an image
in my head of this forest

and your family, I think.

That's so weird.

You did meet them
when you were a child.

Where did they go?

I don't know.

One by one they all left.

Without saying why.

Do you miss them?

Sometimes.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(eerie low rumble)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

What's in there?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Anything.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(crunching footsteps)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Jesus.

What is this place?

Did you make it?

No.

It's a place between places.

Why would I like this
as a kid?

It's kind of scary.

You weren't scared
of the dark yet.

It's very peaceful.

Sometimes I come here
when I'm done with my work.

I like to listen
to the silence.

(water flowing softly)

This was your favorite spot
to swim.

What?

It's true.

I would swim here?

It's pitch-black water.

It's very clean.

You adored it.

Wow.

Yeah.

Yeah, I...

I loved this pond.

I liked it because it was
the perfect temperature.

You used to say
it was like lying on the...

On the kitchen floor.

Whoa.

This is crazy.

I'm remembering.

We used to play here
all the time.

Yeah, we did.

I would always...

I made things.

That's very easy here.

Holy shit.

You try.

See if you remember.

I have no idea.

Pick something up.

Anything?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(wings fluttering)

It's like you never left.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Still good at making things.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I haven't been told that
in a long time.

You don't still make things
where you're from?

Not really.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

We say I do...

I want to.

But it's hard.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I don't see
why you couldn't do so now.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Sometimes the world
seems like

if you're not built right
it's designed to hurt you.

That sounds terrible.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(train bell clanging)

It's Vera.

I was... I was just callin'
to see how you're doin'.

And it just seems like
you kind of disappeared

these past few months.

Hey.

Hey.

You called back.

I did.

(soft crackling sound)

What's happening
to that thing?

The forest is taking it back.

That's terrifying.

It's just becoming
something else.

Why didn't you leave the woods
with the rest of your family?

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean
to upset you.

There's nothing
to be sorry for.

I should have had more tact.

It's hard for me sometimes.

I say the wrong thing
and then fuck up

what I'm actually
trying to say.

I don't think
you fuck anything up.

(Brynn laughs softly)

What?

It's just funny
to hear you swear.

You seem so old-world
or something.

I like it.

You do?

Yeah.

Fuck.


Fuck!


Oh, shit.

What time is it?

I completely lost track.

Is that bad?

I've been gone
since before Laika woke up.

He might be worried.

Would he worry?

Probably.

He seems somewhat...
unconcerned to me.

Well...

you're wrong.

Okay.

Look, I just...
I need to get back.

Can you please take me back...

to the normal forest?

I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said...

No, it's okay, I just...
I really need to get back.

Please, can we go?

(footsteps rustling)

Do you want me
to walk you back?

No, it's fine,
I just need to get back.

Just hold on for a second.
Don't fucking grab me!

(smoke bellowing)

(crickets chirring)

Hey.

Where the hell you been?

I'm sorry, I was in the woods
with Rue all day.

You wanna wait
for me to wake up

next time you decide
to disappear?

Look, I'm sorry,
I know I lost track of time.

I thought we were coming
out here to chill out,

not for you to hang out
with some dude in a fucking mask

all day.

Okay, he's... he's not some... dude
in a mask.

You don't know what he is

because all he does
is talk in circles.

He never says anything real.

Fuck you.


(door opens, closes)

Look, I'm really sorry.

I didn't mean to worry you.

I should have kept
better track of time.

Yeah, you fucking should have.

Don't...

Look, I'm fucking trying
to apologize,

and you insist on continuing
to be an asshole.

I'm not being an asshole.

I'm pissed.
I'm not being an asshole.

What is this,
are you jealous

that I'm... that I'm
in the woods with Rue?

Is that what this is?
I'm not anything.

You just said you were pissed.

Well, what were you guys
even doing?

Were you just out there
touching trees and shit?

Yeah.

Yeah, we fucking...
we touched trees.

It was great.

Um, I'm gonna go to bed.

Yeah, I'm going to bed too.

What?
Yeah.

Maybe you'll hate-fuck me.

Is that the only way
I can get laid anymore?

Oh.

So... so that's what this is?

I'm just saying,
like, we don't...

No, you...

you said
what you're just saying.


Well, I'm gonna sleep
in the car tonight.

Hey, wait...
No, no, um... you know what,

I hope you have a lot of fun
with yourself tonight

since I'm obviously
so useless to you.

Asshole.

(door slams)

(door opens)

(crickets chirring)

(door closes)


God.

(can opens)

Oh...

Fuck me!

God.

(can smacks, door closes)


Damn it!


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(can opens)

(phone vibrating)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(phone clicks)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(fire crackling)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(thunder cracking)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Good morning.

Morning.

Where are we?

I just thought we'd take
a Sunday drive

but not on Sunday.

Whatever day this is.

That sounds nice.

I'm still upset.

I get it.

This is a nice thing to make me
not think about that though.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(leaves rustling)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Look.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Some big-ass trees.

The biggest-ass trees.

God, I love them.

We could take one home with us.

Really?
Yeah.

(birds chirping)

We couldn't though.

Not really.

We could plant one.

Plant one?

Yeah.

We'd have to wait
for it to grow.

I got time.

You have time?

(leaves rustling)

(ambient whirring)

(birds chirping)

(door opening)

(door closes)

Um...

I'm sorry...

for, uh... last night.

I know.

I get it, I know things
have been weird.

Yeah.

It's been...
it's been really weird.

And...

Can we...

Can we just spend some...

Can we just hang out, just us,
the last few days, you know?

You mean, without Rue.

I... I just don't think you should
spend that much time with him.

Fine.

If that's what you want.

Okay.

(deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(crickets chirring)

(door opening)

(footsteps rustling)

Hey.

I'm sorry about what I did.

You didn't deserve that.

I shouldn't have tried
to make you stay.

I understand
why you were angry.

That doesn't change
how I responded.

Is your face okay?

Yeah.

Did I hurt you?

No.

This place isn't like anything.

It's like...

the absence of things.

That's true.

It's like...

what could be.

What could be?

I don't know.

Anything.

(crow squawking)


(door opens)

Hey, morning.

Hi.

You been up for a while?

Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

Huh.

(gentle footsteps)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(snapping sound)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(door opens)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(dish clinking)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Morning.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Thanks.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(crickets chirring)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

What's happening to your arm?

Nothing to be concerned about.

Can I?

It's okay.

(smoke bellowing)

When you first arrived here,
I saw you playing in the woods,

but you couldn't see me.

I didn't have a form
like you did.

So, all of this...

I wanted you to see me.

Oh.


(wind howling)

(door closes)

You can just stay
in the forest tomorrow night.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(door opening)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(door closes)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Hey.

Hey.

Um...

how's everything going?

It's okay.

Um...

I gotta talk to you.

Okay.

I don't...


I...
Just say it.

I...

I don't think we should...
do this anymore.

Okay.

I think maybe...
you have some things

you can figure out
on your own, and...

...I thought I could help
with that, but...

...I just make things worse.

You don't.

I feel like I do.


Well, we...
you can't take my car,

so it's a good thing
you did this now.

I'm just...
I'm gonna take the bus back.

If you could...
drive me to the stop,

maybe?

Let's go.

(car beeps)

(car beeping)

(door opens)

(sighs, door closes)

This is yours.

(keys jingling)

(engine starting)

(wind howling)

(truck honking)

Bye.

Bye.


Oh.

Hi.

Hi.

How are you doing?

Not super great.

I'm sorry.

Laika left.

I know.

I'm sorry that happened.

I don't think you are, but...

Needed to happen, I guess.

I am sorry.

You found an oasis
after you grew up.

I think that's why
there's tension between us.

It's hard to know
that someone you loved

lives in someone else now.

I was so happy as a kid.

Then I grew up and I...

...felt ruined,

felt like I'd changed, and I...

I didn't get a choice in it.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

When it was good,

you made it seem like
that was okay to feel that way.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

That's just how life was.

I'd share it with somebody.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

It would somehow be better.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I don't think
that you're ruined.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Thanks, Rue.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

What's happening to your arm?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I was walking in the woods,

and...


...I got to the pond.

Are you...
And...

Are you trying to come up
with something right now?

(wind howling)

No.

Well, you're not very good
at it, so don't do it.

Just tell me what's going on.


Follow me.

(ambient rumbling, crackling)

I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

I understand.

Just so fucking exhausted.

Are you afraid?

Yeah.

Well, can't you do anything
about it?

I don't have the answers, Brynn.

What about your family,
where are they?

Maybe it already took them.

Maybe that's why they left
in the first place.

They knew our home
would get eaten up.

They just never thought
to tell me.

I've been here
for a very long time,

not doing much of anything,

and it's probably a good thing.

That's not true.

You've been taking care
of an entire forest by yourself.

Maybe.

Or maybe I've just
been fooling myself

into thinking
the forest needed me.

You're important.

I'm sorry I couldn't make you
a new home here.

That's not your job.

(ambient rumbling, crackling)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I need you to take something.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Take care.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(rumbling intensifying)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(birds chirping)

(flames crackling)

(insects chirring)

(keys jingling)

(engine starting, car beeping)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª And I'm sorry I was evil â™ª

â™ª I don't do that anymore â™ª

â™ª I just copy other people â™ª

â™ª Try to forget
what was before â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª This is the punishment â™ª

â™ª For one and all â™ª

â™ª It's exactly what I wanted â™ª

â™ª Don't call it off â™ª

â™ª Here is the punishment â™ª

â™ª It's all I have â™ª

â™ª How I always get excited â™ª

â™ª Don't call it off â™ª

â™ª There was a siren at night â™ª

â™ª that was ringing in my head â™ª

â™ª But I wasn't listening â™ª

â™ª So I did do what I did â™ª

â™ª I hate that I was fake â™ª

â™ª Now there's something else â™ª

â™ª instead of something â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Don't call it off â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Don't call it off, off â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Don't call it off, off, off â™ª

â™ª Don't call it off â™ª

â™ª This is the punishment â™ª

â™ª For one and all â™ª

â™ª It's exactly what I wanted â™ª

â™ª Don't call it off â™ª

â™ª Here is the punishment â™ª

â™ª It's all I have â™ª

â™ª How I always get excited â™ª

â™ª Don't call it off â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Don't call it off â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)
