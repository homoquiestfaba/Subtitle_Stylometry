ON THE iCARLY WEB SHOW

WHO TALKED

TO THE IDIOT FARM GIRL?

&gt;&gt; YEAH.

&gt;&gt; REMEMBER GIBBY?

&gt;&gt; NO, I DON'T REMEMBER GIBBY.

EVEN THOUGH I DID
THE iCARLY WEB SHOW WITH GIBBY

FOR FOUR YEARS,
I HAVE NO MEMORY OF THAT.

WHO'S GIBBY?

&gt;&gt; GIBBY WAS THE KID WHO ALWAYS
TOOK HIS SHIRT OFF.

AND SOMETIMES HE'D GO,
"UH, GIBBEHHHHHH."

REMEMBER?

&gt;&gt; HEY, SAM,
REMEMBER THE TIME...

&gt;&gt; HEY, BOBBY?

&gt;&gt; YEAH?

&gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT TIME
YOU ASKED ME

WAY TOO MANY QUESTIONS
SO I TOOK YOUR PANTS

AND I SLAPPED YOU
ACROSS YOUR OWN FACE

WITH YOUR PANTS?

&gt;&gt; SAM, THAT'S NOT NICE.

&gt;&gt; WELL...

&gt;&gt; BOBBY LOVED WATCHING YOU
ON THE iCARLY WEB SHOW,

SO YOU SHOULD
ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS.

&gt;&gt; HEY, CAT?

&gt;&gt; SHUT UP, I'M BUSY.

&gt;&gt; SO, WHAT WAS IT LIKE
MAKING THE iCARLY WEB SHOW?

&gt;&gt; AHH, IT WAS FUN.

WE DID A LOT OF WACKY STUFF,
I GOT TO GO TO JAPAN,

I MET THE FIRST LADY,
WE GOT KIDNAPPED

A COUPLE OF TIMES.

&gt;&gt; KIDNAPPED?

&gt;&gt; BY WHO?

&gt;&gt; SOME PSYCHO CHICK, NORA.

&gt;&gt; WHERE IS NORA NOW?

&gt;&gt; WELL, SHE'S LOCKED UP
IN PRISON

SOMEWHERE NEAR SEATTLE.

&gt;&gt; DERSHLIT, PLAYTIME'S OVER.

I'M TAKING YOU
BACK TO YOUR CAGE.

&gt;&gt; OKIE DOKIE.

YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY STARTING
TO ENJOY IT HERE IN PRISON.

&gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU ENJOY.

JUST...

&gt;&gt; HEAR WHAT?


&gt;&gt; CHICKEN?

WHO LET A CHICKEN IN THE PRISON?

&gt;&gt; SPLOOSH.

&gt;&gt; HEY, CAT?

I DON'T GET IT.

&gt;&gt; WELL, I LOVE CRANBERRY JUICE.

AND MY FAVORITE FRUIT IS APPLES.

SO, I FILLED THIS FISH TANK UP
WITH CRANBERRY JUICE,

AND I'M SOAKING
THE APPLES IN IT.

&gt;&gt; YOU GET IT?

&gt;&gt; NOPE.

&gt;&gt; I'M MAKING CRAPPLES.

&gt;&gt; CRAPPLES.

&gt;&gt; WANT TO TRY?

WHAT'S IT TASTE LIKE?

&gt;&gt; LIKE CRAPPLE.

&gt;&gt; RIGHT?

â™ª BUT IT'S ALL GOING TO BE â™ª
â™ª JUST FINE â™ª

â™ª (JUST FINE) â™ª
â™ª YOU AND ME â™ª

â™ª WE'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE â™ª
â™ª HMMM... â™ª

&gt;&gt; NEAR SEATTLE, WASHINGTON,
A DANGEROUSLY PSYCHOTIC

YOUNG WOMAN IS STILL
ON THE LOOSE AFTER ESCAPING

FROM PRISON TWO DAYS AGO.

THE WOMAN, NORA DERSHLIT,
WAS SERVING A FIVE-YEAR SENTENCE

FOR A PRIOR KIDNAPPING.

[TIMER DINGS]
&gt;&gt; IT'S READY.

&gt;&gt; HO YO.

I'M HERE
AND I'M NOT LEAVING TILL MONDAY.

&gt;&gt; HEY.

DID YOUR MOM ALREADY LEAVE TOWN

&gt;&gt; YEAH.

HER CAR BROKE DOWN,
SO THEY TOOK MY...

&gt;&gt; HEY, NO.

[SPEAKING SPANISH]
HEY, DICE, I NEED YOU

TO GET ME A MEXICAN
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

&gt;&gt; EASY.

YOUR NAME OR A FAKE NAME?

&gt;&gt; FAKE.

MAKE MY NAME
SAMATIO PUCKATITO.

&gt;&gt; I GOT IT.

&gt;&gt; HEY.

WHO WANTS TO TRY
MY HOT CRAPPLE PIE?

&gt;&gt; LET'S ANSWER TOGETHER.

&gt;&gt; LET'S SING THE ANSWER.

â™ª NOBODY â™ª
&gt;&gt; HEY, YOU WANT TO SNUGGLE?

â™ª NOBODY â™ª
&gt;&gt; HEY, YOU WANT TO SNUGGLE?

&gt;&gt; BABE, COME ON,
THERE'S PEOPLE HERE.

GET OFF.

&gt;&gt; HELLO, GIBBY.

&gt;&gt; WHOA. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

NORA?

&gt;&gt; THAT'S ME.

&gt;&gt; WAIT, WAIT,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN PRISON

FOR A COUPLE MORE YEARS.

&gt;&gt; RIGHT, I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE,
BUT TWO DAYS AGO, I ESCAPED.

&gt;&gt; WOW. GOOD FOR YOU.

&gt;&gt; HOW'D YOU ESCAPE?

&gt;&gt; BABE? BABY.

WHY DON'T YOU JUST
ANSWER THE TRIVIA QUESTIONS?

&gt;&gt; SO, GIBBY, I DON'T WANT
TO INJURE YOU...

&gt;&gt; COOL.

&gt;&gt; BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO LOCATE AND DESTROY CARLY,

THEN SAM, THEN FREDDIE.

&gt;&gt; AH, FUN.

&gt;&gt; SO, WHERE WOULD I FIND CARLY?

&gt;&gt; SORRY, DUDE, SHE'S IN ITALY.

&gt;&gt; AW. THAT'S TOO FAR.

WHAT ABOUT SAM?

SAM PUCKETT?

&gt;&gt; SAM'S NOT THAT FAR.

SHE'S JUST DOWN THE COAST
A WAYS IN LOS ANGELES.

&gt;&gt; LOS ANGELES.

&gt;&gt; YEAH, I CAN TEXT YOU
HER HOME ADDRESS IF YOU WANT.

&gt;&gt; YES.

I WOULD LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.

&gt;&gt; NO PROB.

&gt;&gt; LATER, GIBBY.

&gt;&gt; HEY, GOOD LUCK.

&gt;&gt; HOLA CHICAS.

SAM, YOUR DAY IS ABOUT
TO GET MAJORLY BUENO.

&gt;&gt; YEAH.

&gt;&gt; MIRA ESTO.

&gt;&gt; [GASPS]
YOU GOT ME

A MEXICAN DRIVER'S LICENSE.

&gt;&gt; SHH.

&gt;&gt; WHOA.

&gt;&gt; WOW.

CONGRATULATIONS,
"SAMATIO PUCKATITO."

&gt;&gt; MUY QUESO.

&gt;&gt; AH, MY LITTLE DICE MAN.

HOW MUCH DO I LOVE THIS KID,
HUH?

I TELL YOU, I'D BE LOST
WITHOUT THIS LITTLE

FUZZY-HEADED MOP FACE.

&gt;&gt; WELL, IT SEEMS
THAT SAM PUCKETT

IS QUITE FOND OF THE YOUNG BOY
WITH THE GLORIOUS HAIR.

[PHONE DINGS]
&gt;&gt; AH, JEEZ, I BETTER

GO TO GOOMER'S APARTMENT.

&gt;&gt; [GROWLS]
&gt;&gt; WHAT FOR?

&gt;&gt; HE SAYS,
"DICE, PLEASE COME OVER.

I THOUGHT I WAS IN THE BATHROOM,
BUT I WASN'T."

&gt;&gt; OH.

&gt;&gt; OH.

&gt;&gt; YEAH, LATER.

&gt;&gt; [GRUNTING]
SO LARGE.

NO ONE HELPING ME.

&gt;&gt; HEY, YOU NEED SOME HELP?

&gt;&gt; OH, HELLO, LITTLE BOY.

&gt;&gt; HI.

WHATCHA TRYING TO DO THERE?

&gt;&gt; OH, I'M HAVING TROUBLE
PUTTING THIS INFLATABLE KAYAK

INTO MY CAR.

&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LET THE AIR OUT OF IT?

&gt;&gt; OH, NO, NO, NO.

&gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S NOT GOING
TO FIT IN YOUR CAR.

&gt;&gt; MY CAR'S INTERIOR
IS A LOT ROOMIER THAN IT SEEMS.

CHECK FOR YOURSELF.

&gt;&gt; OKAY.

IT'S REALLY NOT THAT ROOMY
IN HERE.

HEY, LET ME OUT.

MY FRIEND GOOMER
WENT TO THE BATHROOM SOMEWHERE

THAT'S NOT A BATHROOM.

&gt;&gt; TOO BAD.

I'VE GOT AN APPOINTMENT...

WITH REVENGE.

&gt;&gt; BUT...

WHAT ABOUT YOUR KAYAK?

&gt;&gt; ANSWER, ANSWER, ANSWER.

&gt;&gt; DID YOU FIND DICE?

&gt;&gt; NO, HE WON'T
PICK UP HIS PHONE.

DID YOU LOOK FOR HIM?

&gt;&gt; YEAH.

I WENT TO INSIDE OUT BURGER,
AND TUBBA CHICKEN,

AND I WENT TO CHUB-WAY,
AND ROCKIN' RIBS.

[PHONE RINGING]
&gt;&gt; IS THAT DICE?

&gt;&gt; NO, DANG IT.

IT'S GIBBY.

WHAT, GIBBY?

&gt;&gt; HEY, SAM, GUESS WHAT?

&gt;&gt; I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

&gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT GIRL,
NORA DERSHLIT?

&gt;&gt; YES, I REMEMBER NORA.

WHY?

&gt;&gt; SHE BUSTED OUT OF PRISON.

&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW?

&gt;&gt; SHE CAME TO SEE ME
AT THE MOVIES.

&gt;&gt; SHE CAME TO SEE YOU?

FOR WHAT?

&gt;&gt; LET'S SEE,
SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO LOCATE

AND DESTROY CARLY, THEN YOU,
AND THEN FREDDIE.

&gt;&gt; AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?

&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY.

I TOLD HER CARLY'S IN ITALY
AND NORA SAID

THAT WAS WAY TOO FAR.

&gt;&gt; GOOD.

&gt;&gt; AND THEN I TOLD HER
YOU WERE IN L.A.

AND I GAVE HER YOUR ADDRESS.

NO.

OKAY, THIS IS BAD.

&gt;&gt; WHO'S NORA?

&gt;&gt; SHE'S THAT INSANE CHICK
THAT KIDNAPPED ME,

NORA DERSHLIT.

&gt;&gt; BUT I THOUGHT
SHE WAS IN PRISON.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
&gt;&gt; WHO'S THAT?

&gt;&gt; AH!

WHAT'S IN THE ENVELOPE?

&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

&gt;&gt; WHAT'S IT SAY?

&gt;&gt; "I HAVE YOUR FRIEND, DICE."

&gt;&gt; OH MY...
&gt;&gt; "AND IN CASE

"YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
HAIR'S A LITTLE PIECE OF HIM."

&gt;&gt; [GASPS]
&gt;&gt; SIGNED, "NORA."

[PHONE RINGING]
HELLO?

&gt;&gt; DID YOU MISS ME?

&gt;&gt; NORA?

&gt;&gt; SO, YOU REMEMBER MY VOICE.

&gt;&gt; WHERE'S DICE?

&gt;&gt; OH, SAM,
NO "HI NORA, I MISSED YOU?"

NO "HOW WAS PRISON?"
NO "SORRY FOR CAUSING

"THE SOCIAL WORKERS
"TO SEND MY CHICKEN

TO A FOSTER FARM?"
&gt;&gt; THEY TOOK YOUR CHICKEN AWAY

'CAUSE YOU'RE A LUNATIC.

&gt;&gt; YOU BETTER WATCH IT,
SAM PUCKETT.

I HAVE YOUR YOUNG FRIEND, DICE,
AND I HAVE PLANS FOR HIS HAIR.

&gt;&gt; HIS HAIR?

&gt;&gt; SHH.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN HIS HAIR?

&gt;&gt; BYE, SAM.

[DIAL TONE]
&gt;&gt; POOR DICE.

&gt;&gt; HE'S SO HOSED.

&gt;&gt; NO.

NO, WE JUST GOT TO FIND HIM.

&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT SHE WON'T TELL US
WHERE HE IS.

&gt;&gt; I KNOW. SO...

SO WE JUST GOT TO TRY TO,
YOU KNOW, FIGURE OUT

WHAT NORA WOULD DO.

&gt;&gt; YES.

&gt;&gt; WE GOT TO THINK
HOW SHE THINKS.

&gt;&gt; YES!

&gt;&gt; AH!

&gt;&gt; YES?

&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHO COULD REALLY
HELP US THINK LIKE A DISEASED,

EVIL, CRIMINAL MASTERMIND?

&gt;&gt; WHO?

&gt;&gt; ANOTHER DISEASED, EVIL,
CRIMINAL MASTERMIND.

&gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU WANT
TO SEE MY PATIENT?

&gt;&gt; WE NEED TO ASK HIM
SOME QUESTIONS.

&gt;&gt; WHY IS HE HERE
IN THIS HOSPITAL?

&gt;&gt; HIS MOTHER BROUGHT HIM HERE
FROM SEATTLE.

HE HAS A VIRUS.

VERY CONTAGIOUS.

THAT'S WHY HE MUST BE
KEPT DOWN HERE, LOCKED AWAY

FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION.

&gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF VIRUS?

&gt;&gt; IT'S CALLED PORCUPOX.

WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT IT.

ALL WE KNOW IS THAT
IT CAME FROM A PORCUPINE.

&gt;&gt; WHATEVER.

JUST LET US TALK TO HIM.

&gt;&gt; IT'S THAT WAY.

THE LAST ONE.

GIRLS.

DON'T TOUCH THE GLASS.

&gt;&gt; WHY NOT?

&gt;&gt; I JUST CLEANED IT.

&gt;&gt; I JUST CLEANED IT.

&gt;&gt; COCKADOODLE DOO,
THE COW SAYS MOO.

&gt;&gt; SAMANTHA PUCKETT.

&gt;&gt; 'SUP, NEVEL?

&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU HERE?

&gt;&gt; OKAY, SO, WE HAVE
THIS FRIEND, DICE.

&gt;&gt; YOU MEAN THE YOUNG BOY,
AGE 12, WHOSE FULL NAME

IS DICENIO J. CORLEONE,
SIXTH GRADE,

MAGNIFICENT HAIR?

&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT DICE?

&gt;&gt; I KNOW A LOT OF THINGS
ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS.

&gt;&gt; WELL, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO DICE?

&gt;&gt; TELL ME.

&gt;&gt; SOME WEIRD GIRL TOOK HIM.

&gt;&gt; HER NAME IS NORA DERSHLIT.

HERE, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

&gt;&gt; SAM!

SAM LISTEN TO ME,
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

SAM, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

&gt;&gt; PUT YOUR HANDS BACK.

&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS?

&gt;&gt; IT'S THE NOTE NORA GAVE US.

&gt;&gt; [CLEARS THROAT]
"I HAVE YOUR FRIEND, DICE.

"AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
HAIR'S A LITTLE PIECE OF HIM."

&gt;&gt; HERE'S THE PIECE OF HAIR
SHE PUT IN THERE.

&gt;&gt; THE BOY DOES HAVE
AMAZING HAIR.

&gt;&gt; WE KNOW.

&gt;&gt; WE JUST NEED TO FIND HIM.

&gt;&gt; THEN WE MUST
LOOK AT THE CLUES.

&gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE ANY CLUES.

&gt;&gt; WRONG, SIR.

SEE THIS?

NOTICE THIS STAIN?

&gt;&gt; IS IT KETCHUP?

&gt;&gt; NO.

THIS HAS MORE FLAVOR
AND THE TANG OF...

PINEAPPLE.

THIS STAIN WAS MADE
BY DONKEY SAUCE.

&gt;&gt; DONKEY SAUCE?

THE ONLY PLACE
THAT HAS DONKEY SAUCE IS...

ALOHA BURGER.

&gt;&gt; CORRECT.

&gt;&gt; SO, YOU'RE SAYING,
IF WE HAPPEN TO FIND A DONKEY

EATING A HAMBURGER,
THEN DICE IS SOMEWHERE

IN HA-WAI-AYE-AYE?

&gt;&gt; OKAY, THIS GIRL MAKES GIBBY
SEEM LIKE A GENIUS.

&gt;&gt; JUST TELL US WHERE DICE IS.

&gt;&gt; WE REALLY CAN'T KNOW
FOR SURE.

BUT...

THE PERFECT PLACE
TO HIDE A PERSON WOULD BE

IN AN ABANDONED HOUSE.

AND WITHIN ONE MILE
OF ALOHA BURGER,

THERE ARE
THREE ABANDONED HOUSES.

&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW?

&gt;&gt; I'M STUDYING FOR
MY JUNIOR REAL ESTATE LICENSE.

&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; THERE IS ONE ABANDONED HOUSE
ON CROSBY STREET,

ONE ON STILLS LANE,
AND ONE ON NASH AVENUE.

LOOK IN THOSE HOUSES THREE,
AND YOUR FRIEND DICE,

YOU SHALL SEE.

&gt;&gt; GREAT.

WE JUST NEED TO CHECK OUT
THOSE THREE VACANT HOUSES

ON CROSBY, STILLS, AND NASH.

&gt;&gt; LET'S HURRY.

&gt;&gt; SAM! SAM, WAIT!

GET ME OUT OF HERE!

&gt;&gt; HEY, GIRL.

I'M GETTING HUNGRY.

&gt;&gt; HELLO, DICE.

HOW'S THE HOLE?

&gt;&gt; CAN I GET
A SANDWICH OR SOMETHING?

&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; WHATEVER SANDWICH YOU GOT.

TUNA SALAD, PEANUT BUTTER.

I JUST NEED FOOD.

&gt;&gt; LOOK IN THE BASKET.

&gt;&gt; HAIR CONDITIONER?

&gt;&gt; IT PUTS THE CONDITIONER
IN ITS HAIR

IF IT WANTS THE SANDWICH.

&gt;&gt; WHO'S "IT"?

&gt;&gt; YOU'RE "IT".

&gt;&gt; I'M NOT PUTTING
THIS CONDITIONER IN MY HAIR.

&gt;&gt; IT PUTS THE CONDITIONER
IN ITS HAIR OR ELSE

IT GETS THE HOSE AGAIN.

&gt;&gt; AW, MAN, AGAIN WITH THE HOSE?

&gt;&gt; THAT TEARS IT.

&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST

WASTING HOSES.

&gt;&gt; OH, DEAR.

SOMEONE'S AT THE DOOR.

&gt;&gt; WAIT.

IT'S STILL HUNGRY.

&gt;&gt; HELLO, GIRL.

HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU SEEN MY FRIEND DICE?

&gt;&gt; NO.

&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SURE?

&gt;&gt; OH, WAIT.

IS HE A LITTLE YOUNG PERSON
WITH GREAT BIG FAT HAIR?

&gt;&gt; YES, HE HAS BIG HAIR, MA'AM.

&gt;&gt; WELL, I KNOW NOTHING.

HEY, HEY, BEFORE YOU GO,
YOU WANT TO COME

CHECK OUT MY BASEMENT?

&gt;&gt; WELL, SURE.

OH!

&gt;&gt; CAT! WHOA, ARE YOU OKAY?

&gt;&gt; YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT.

LUCKY I LANDED ON THESE HOSES.

&gt;&gt; WELL, WELL.

GET IT?

YOU GUYS ARE DOWN IN A WELL,
SO I SAID, "WELL, WELL."

&gt;&gt; THAT'S GREAT FUN, BUT...

I THINK YOU KNOCKED ME DOWN HERE
BY ACCIDENT, SO, COULD YOU

PLEASE GIVE ME A HAND?

&gt;&gt; CAT, IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

&gt;&gt; HAIR BOY'S RIGHT.

YOU BOTH ARE MY PRISONERS.

&gt;&gt; WAIT. I THINK THAT'S NORA.

&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US?

&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I HATE SAM PUCKETT
AND YOU TWO ARE HER FRIENDS.

SO, FIRST,
I'M GOING TO SHAVE DICE'S HAIR

AND MAKE IT INTO A WIG
FOR ME TO WEAR.

&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LIGHTS?

[CHICKEN CLUCKING]
&gt;&gt; MAURICE, WHERE ARE YOU?

&gt;&gt; WHO WANTS CHICKEN?

&gt;&gt; SAM PUCKETT.

DON'T YOU TOUCH MY CHICKEN.

&gt;&gt; OH, I'M ALREADY TOUCHING IT.

&gt;&gt; YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE.

&gt;&gt; LET'S MAKE A DEAL.

YOU THROW A ROPE DOWN
SO CAT AND DICE CAN CLIMB

OUT OF THAT PIT,
AND I WON'T PLUCK,

COOK, EAT, DIGEST,
AND POOP OUT THIS CHICKEN.

&gt;&gt; NO.

WHY DON'T YOU AND I FIGHT?

&gt;&gt; [GASPS]
&gt;&gt; AND IF YOU WIN,

YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
MAY GO FREE.

&gt;&gt; COOL.

LET'S DANCE.

&gt;&gt; BUT IF I WIN,
DOWN THE PIT YOU GO.

&gt;&gt; SAM, DON'T DO IT.

&gt;&gt; THERE'S NO SANDWICHES
DOWN HERE.

&gt;&gt; JUST HOSES.

&gt;&gt; SO...

READY TO BATTLE?

&gt;&gt; YOU READY TO BLEED?

&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK
I'LL BE INJURED.

YOU SEE, SAM,
I'VE BEEN IN PRISON

FOR TWO YEARS LIFTING WEIGHTS,
GETTING STRONGER AND ANGRIER.

AND WHAT HAS
SAM PUCKETT BEEN DOING?

OH, BABYSITTING.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE.

&gt;&gt; COME ON, COME ON, SAMMY.

COME GET A TASTE OF NORA.

YEAH.

OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

READY, SET...

NO FAIR GRABBING MY FOOT.

&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, SORRY.

&gt;&gt; YOU LET GO RIGHT NOW.

&gt;&gt; OKAY.

&gt;&gt; [SCREAMS]
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?

&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE'RE FINE.

&gt;&gt; I'M NOT FINE.

[ALARM RINGING]
&gt;&gt; OH, MY G...

EMERGENCY.

EMERGENCY!

NEVEL PAPPERMAN HAS ESCAPED.

&gt;&gt; COCKADOODLE DOO,
THE COW SAYS...

&gt;&gt; WE KNOW WHAT THE COW SAYS.

&gt;&gt; SO, WHAT HAPPENS TO NORA NOW?

&gt;&gt; SHE GOES BACK TO PRISON
IN SEATTLE.

WE'RE GONNA PUT HER
IN MAXIMUM SECURITY.

SHE WON'T BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

&gt;&gt; OH, YES I WILL.

I WILL RETURN
AND I WILL BOTHER SAM AGAIN.

AND THAT GOES
FOR ALL THE FILTHY iCARLYS.

AND YOU DIRTY SAM AND CATS.

I'M A CHARACTER
THAT NEVER DIES.

&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.

I REMEMBER YOU,
FROM THE iCARLY WEB SHOW.

&gt;&gt; THANKS.

&gt;&gt; HEY, REMEMBER THAT GUY
WHO ALWAYS USED TO GO "GIBBEHH"?

&gt;&gt; GET OUT OF HERE.

ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HIT UP

SOME ALOHA BURGER?

&gt;&gt; DONKEY SAUCE.

&gt;&gt; YAY.

&gt;&gt; MISS PUCKETT.

PHONE FOR YOU.

&gt;&gt; ME?

PUCKETT.

&gt;&gt; SO, DID YOU FIND
YOUR BIG-HAIRED FRIEND...

DICE?

&gt;&gt; NEVEL.

&gt;&gt; HELLO, SAM.

&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU?

&gt;&gt; OH, I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.

YOU MIGHT SEND PEOPLE
TO LOOK FOR ME.

&gt;&gt; NEVEL, TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE.

&gt;&gt; OH, I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T DO THAT, SAM.

YOU SEE...

I'M HAVING AN OLD FRIEND
FOR DINNER.

&gt;&gt; NOT JUST ONE OLD FRIEND...

CHECK IT.

DOUBLE HEADER.

HA.

&gt;&gt; SAM, I GOT TO GO.

&gt;&gt; NEVEL.

[DIAL TONE]
&gt;&gt; I TOLD YOU

NOT TO BRING THAT THING.

&gt;&gt; COME ON,
LET'S GO GET SOME TAPENADE.

&gt;&gt; OOH, ALL RIGHT.

BUT WE'RE SPLITTING THE CHECK
THREE WAYS.

&gt;&gt; AW, DUDE.

&gt;&gt; WHOA.

INFLATABLE KAYAK?

I COULD USE THIS
AT MY BEACH HOUSE.

MY LIFE'S GOING GREAT.

[OVEN BELL]
&gt;&gt; MMM...
