What are you doing here?

Who has touched you?

Imhotep!

My priest!

Pharaoh's bodyguards.

You must go! Save yourself!

-Only you can resurrect me!

I won't leave you!

Get away from me!

You shall live again!

I will resurrect you!

My body is no longer his temple!

Come with me
my Princess Anck-su-namun.

The language of the slaves...

Kill them all!

Kill them...

...and wake the others.

With your death, Anck-su-namun shall live.

And I shall be invincible!

The Book of Amun-Ra.

Destroy him!

I command you to destroy him!

Give me that book!

Now you die.

Now it's your turn.
