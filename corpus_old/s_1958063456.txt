Happy Birthday to you!

You live in a shoe!

But that's not so bad...

'cause it's a Jimmy

Choo.

Show me your coin.

Ta-da.

"We rarely see someone fail..."

"...who has thoroughly
followed our path."

That'd look good next to yours.

You keep it. You've earned it.

And, happy second
birthday to you.

Sounds like something out
of Alice in Wonderland.

The day you were born, and
the day you got clean.

Here's to the newborn.

Cheers! It's gonna be
a hell of a year.

Fuck, yeah.

I love you, baby.

Aww. Okay...

Make a wish.

So it's just this head?

Of a woman, yeah.

And the guts hang out?

While it's floating in the air.

That's gross. That's gross.

Uh, what about your fairy tales?

The dude-bros,
forcing themselves
on princesses while they sleep.

No, I mean...

I've never heard of
it... the, uh...

Penanggalan. Is
that how you say it?

Or Arp. That's... what
my Ba used to call it.

Your grandma?

Yeah, my grandma.

That woman was obsessed
with my virginity

for some reason, you know?

Sure.

I mean, I don't know.
I don't know.

Yeah, she wanted me to be a
doctor. Or someone who builds
shit.

I dunno. Something like that.

So she told you about
this vampire thing?

Yeah, I mean it was it was
like a vampire. See,
I was supposed to be pure
so she told me all

these disgusting stories
to scare me. I was
only 10 years old. So, basically,
they're abstinence PSAs.

Gotcha.

Just because I wanted
to be an actor.

So, she thought you were, uh...

A slut. Bad girl. "Don't
be a slut..."

"...Or the floating head will
come eat your baby."

"Suck your fetus
right outta ya!"

So, so gross.

Oh, my grandma. She
loved talking about

fetus cannibalism.

You still had sex, though?

Of course. All the time.
Yeah, but that's
not the point. Tell
me about your mom.

She fuck you up with
fairy tales too?

Nah...

My mom never told me
stuff like that.

Oh... so...

She went for the good-old
warm and fuzzies.

The Old Man Who Sees You
When You're Sleeping.

Yeah, right.

Oh, no. Or the capitalist
propaganda...

THROW-UP A BODY PART!

PUT IT UNDER YOUR PILLOW!

GET SOME MONEY!

Or, the, umm... the
Giant Mutant Bunny,
Who Profiteers Off Of
Eggs. The classics!

Mm-hmm.

Oh, my god!

We're talking about my mom!

Well, that's when you
know you've made it.

Where? To Freud's couch?

Ah! Freud's full of shit.

So what did you mean?
"I made it"...?

A real...

Relationship.

I dunno. My mom was just... Mom.

That was scary enough.

You make her sound
like a Succubus.

She was.

Couldn't be all that bad.

Oh, just wait till
you meet her...

Chocolate is
Massimo's favorite.

Oh, I know. He's quite
the Chocoholic.

I bet she was a badass.

Things were better
before Dad left.

Did she ever call the cops?

They didn't do much. Figured
he went down to Mexico.

Mom said he was into a lot of
nasty shit with a lot of nasty
people.

Drugs?

Drugs. Money. I dunno. He just
fell off the face of the Earth.

I'm sorry.

Yeah, but... Crate's
been good to her.

Oh, yeah.

Your Stepdad.

Zeb Crate.

Vino?

Oh, no. Thanks.

Uh, she doesn't drink.

Crate knew my Dad.

Helped set me up.
Odd jobs, here and there.

You live around here?

Uh, no. She's got a place
in the Valley.

So... you two aren't, uh...?

No! No, we're not
living together.

Well... not yet.

Um...

Zeb's a real Chocoholic too.

Mm-hmm. Goddamn right. Love
me some Chocolate.

And you're an... Alcoholic...

Right?

Zeb...

Oh, that's okay. That was
a long, long... really
long time ago. That's
why I have this.

Oh, well...

Good for you, honey.

What do you do?

I'm a bartender.

Really?

Uh, over
in Beverly Hills.

Sounds risky.

Are you fucking kidding
me...? - Shh...

Massimo...

Did I say... Anything?
He meant that as a compliment.

So you know a little bit
about this? - Oh, yes.
That's Chorazos. Uh, that's a
pretty swanky...

...pinot noir you have.

Goddamn right, it is.

Well, we love it.

It's from the Carpathians.

Where?

Transylvania. - Oh,
where the vampires live.

Something like that.

I never
drink... alone.

Okay, Dad jokes.

I'm sorry. I've
got to split.

Thanks for coming by, babe.

Nice to meet you both.

Call you tomorrow?

Sounds good.

So...? What
did you think?

Um... she's...

Nice, right?

She's very... - What'd
you say she does again?

I don't think I did say.

So what does she do?

Yes, honey. What was it again?

She's a bartender, mom.
Oh, that's right.

So, she ever consider doing
anything else? Like a...

That's very
brave.
...career... Or a...?

Real job?

Well, the pay's pretty good.
She's an actress, and...
she's amazing. She's gonna be a
big star

Is that so?
Yeah, that's so.

That's nice.

It's not like she
works in a dive
bar downtown. She works
in Beverly Hills.

Well, what about?

What about me?

Maybe she can get you a job.

A job?

He's got a job!

I just thought he could...

Could what?!

Don't talk to her like that!

It's okay honey, um...

So you want me to hear him out?

Yes. You need
to hear me out.

Just listen to your father.

Jesus Christ, he's
not my father.

Aw, honey... I just...

I've already heard it,
mom. All of it.

That's not what this is about.
Course not.
No one is saying...

I'm not with Tien for a job.

Did we say that?!
No, we didn't.

Did we say anything even
remotely close to that?

Honey, we just want
what's best for you.

"Tien"... "Tien"...
That's, uh, Chinese?

Vietnamese.

So she's got like a... work
visa, or something?

She was born here.

That's nice. Her parents
live here?

Yes, mom. They were born here.

I meant, do they live
in California.

You know, your
uncle was in Vietnam.

What? What uncle?

His brother, honey.

They tortured the shit
out of him in a camp.

What is this? Jesus Christ,
what is this shit?!

Hey, watch your language.

Just... get out of here.

Honey, we just...!

GET THE FUCK OUT!

Honey...

Wait in the car.
Please!

Wait for me in the car.
It'll be fine.

Please don't do anything...

CAR!!

What've you told her?

Nothing.

Did you tell her what you do?

Tien doesn't know shit.

Break it off.

What?

You heard me.

You can't be serious.
This
is not open to discussion.

FUCK YOU!!

Who do you think you're talking
to? I'm not some
fucking politician. I
am king and country.

She's the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

I am the best thing
that's ever going
to happen to you. Alright?

Don't you see it?
She's playing you
for the money. For MY money!

It's not like that!
She's a drunk.

All right? Can't you see
what's gonna happen?
You're fire, she's gas. You are
heading for one big boom!

Look what she did for me.

That is the badge of a weak man.

You're not weak.

Fine.

Don't forget who pays the bills.

You made your point.

And that stuff about
a job. She's
just blowing smoke up your ass.

All right? You got one purpose
in this life and
that's whatever the
fuck I say it is.

Get out.

Break it off.

Fuck.

Go away!

Said go away.

Massimo?

Tien?

Who are you?

Well, hello to you too.

Can I come in?

Ah, Chorazos.

No, no wine.

Something I gotta tell
you, and you should
listen, cause it's gonna
change your life.

Massimo!

"Messy Massimo."

Are you okay?

What do you mean?
I've been trying
to get a hold of you for a week!

A week?

Babe, what's going on?

Tien, I...
You know, I was gonna try
to get a hold of your parents,
but you never gave me their...

I can't see you anymore...
It's not gonna work.

Why? I... I don't understand.

I'm sorry. I didn't want
this to happen, not
like this... Jesus, fuck!

Talk to me. What's going on?

What's wrong?
You won't understand!

What's going on?

I fucked up... Babe, I
fucked up real bad.

Please don't do this!

Honey.

NO...! Get the fuck out!

We just love you.

You're not my mom.

Baby, I'm
not going anywhere.

Stop it!

Is it the job?

What?

For Crate?

No, it's not that...
Don't call him.
Don't call Crate. I'm telling
you, don't call him.

I don't know what else to do!

Okay... All right... okay, we
can... we can handle this...

How deep are you in?

What do you mean?

Crate. I know what's
going on. I can help you.

No, no. It's not Crate.

I'm coming over.

No, don't do that!

WHY?!

YOU CAN'T! Just...
look, I'm sorry...

WHAT IS GOING ON?!

What the hell was that?

Honey?

Who's that?

Who're you talking to?

I'm Tien. Who are you?

Thought you told her.

Who are you?

Who do you want me to be?

I'm Sofia. He didn't tell you?

Tien... there's... something
I need to tell you...

You don't need to tell her shit.

Take a hint.

Good boy.

A week?

The transformation takes
time. We've got plenty of it.

I can't remember anything.

Look on the bright side.
All those habits of your's...

...those appetites...

...can't hurt you now...

Indulge them.

You're cute.

No, I can't!

Oh, baby. I could
just eat you up.

Baby...

I'm not going anywhere.

Why are we here?
You wanted to be discreet.

Yeah, but I
choose the place.
And not at fucking night.

It was a hot day.
You ever think the
sun is having a midlife crisis?

You look like shit.

It's been hard for
me. - How so?

Going outside.

Oh, yeah? Well, excuse
the fuck out of
me. All right. Sorry
I cut into your

nightlife you millennial
soyboy piece of shit.
Did you count it?

You wouldn't want that.

Good boy.

Just took my cut.

Well, that would be counting it.

Here. Your mother wants you
to have that. Consider
it a bonus.

Like a raise?
Something like that.

There any more?

How's that?

I mean, that's not
much of a raise.

So we're gonna talk about money?

Look, if you want to
talk about money...

I've more than earned it.

We're not gonna talk.

I don't wanna talk
about the money.

You should know,
it's about Tien.

We're not going to talk
about her either.

Maybe we should.

You are
a cock-sucking
little cockroach.

Be a pro. Do it right,
or don't do it at all.

Go ahead... Please.

You are one dumb son of a bitch.

Contact said for me to take
the car and the bag...

So get the fuck out.

Why're you
still going out
there? - I miss the sun.

So did my ex...

Till about... Lincoln.

Ex?

Believe it or not, vampires
like monogamy.

What happened to him?

SHE didn't care for

LA, the people, the 21st
Century. She just
ripped your own guts out.
Nickel's worth of

free advice, stay away from
people you care about.

So that's why you don't
want me calling Tien?

Just looking out for you.

That the only reason?

You've got her eyes

So how was the job?

There was no job. - Oh, no?

THERE WAS NO JOB!

Was there ever a job?
Course not.

Those even taste good?
Course not.

There was a job.

I knew it. - Knew what?

Knew you'd do this.
WHAT?

Lie to me. Then double
back. Then double back
on the double back.

I just told you the truth!

You said there was no job!

And there wasn't, until
there was...

He's my father... I owe him.

Oh, my god. I'm your father now!

Stop babying me.

I'm not here to baby you.

Look, I get it. You don't want
me doing mortal things.

Don't you do that. Don't
you fucking do that!

Guess what? - I know
what you're thinking.

GUESS WHAT?!

THERE'S NO CURE!

I'M NOT GIVING UP!

I'm out of here.

If only.

I'm not gonna play
a rousing game
of "bounce around the point".

Bounce out the door. Forever.

It's not my job to carry
your ass. You're not
even a good lay.

OW!!

What the fuck was that?
Did you bite me...?
You're gonna fucking bite
me?! For fuck sake!

That hurt, you little shit!
Think I'm fucking meat?

You think it's fucking feeding
time? Fuck you!

You can go FUCK YOURSELF!

Baby...

I'm not going anywhere.

Sounds like something out
of Alice in Wonderland.

Happy second birthday to you!

Sounds like something
out of Alice and Wonderland.

Here's to the newborn.

Let's call this what it
is. Next time you go
out, you're going
with a handler.

A fucking handler. You
should be ashamed of
yourself.

This is kindergarten bullshit
we're talking here.

Hi, it's Tien. I'm
out right now,
making the dream come true.

Crate? - Yeah?

What day is it?

So, you
know what to do.

You cunt.

Hi, honey.

Get out.

You don't get it.
Oh, what's that?

This isn't something you can
wiggle your way out of.

I'll tell Tien.

Bad idea. - I will.

I told you to burn her number.

I'll tell her everything!

And tell her what... exactly?

You bitch.

She wouldn't believe you anyway.

I can at least tell her
to get a crucifix.
Those don't work.

She can pick up garlic pills!
You're an idiot.

Why me?

Honey, you're tired. You're
still transitioning.

No, I want to know! I think
you owe me that.

I don't owe you shit.

You ruined my life!
Not much to ruin.

Answer me, goddammit!

DON'T PUSH IT!

Could give you the long story.
That we've always
been here. That we're legion.
That we suck the

blood of all thy race. But you
know that. You've got Twitter.

So that's it?

That's all, Messy. And all there
ever will be. So, long story
short, your blood

smelled like cherry syrup,
and I was famished.

Gets easier, once your
tear ducts fall off.

So is there like
a rule book or something?

We're not Shriners.

Come on.

Nine times out of ten, the
sun doesn't mean shit.

But it hurts.

Yeah, I figured that
out for myself.

Then why go out?
I have to work.

For what? For food? That's done.

But I'm hungry all the time.

You know why.

Okay, what is this?

That's O-Ayer,
or the O.A.E.

Supposedly,
it's the first
word of the first name...

...of the first being
born in the universe.

So bullshit.
Maybe.

Gobbledegook!

Okay, you know what? Lay off!

Okay, so... it's... it's
like your religion?

It's a big part of our history.

O-Ayer isn't male or female. It's
not really consciousness as we
think of it. It's more like
this thing that...

...permeates existence.
Creepy.

It's a metaphysical
concept. It's not
like there's something
actually...

...out there.
Tell that to the Pope.

A lot of people did. In the 12th
Century. They were burned.

Friends of yours...? What else?

Like Holy Water?
Something like that.

There's nothing like
that. No stakes.

No crosses. Everything
is just marking time.

What do you mean?

Nothing can stop you... but you.

Sounds like an infomercial.

Fine! Then fuck off!

No! I... I want to hear it.

You got to know all the
tricks. It's a game.
Mind-over-matter,
like an athlete.

Mind-over-matter.

Here... Let me show you.

Hold your hand over that.

Bet I can get it first.

You're like a mile away.

Then it should be easy.
One... two... three!

Jesus!

Soon you'll be able to do that.

Shit.

Whatever you think you
had, it's gone.

You pissed it all away. Now
you gotta stay active.

What d'you mean?

Hunting.

You gotta stay on the prowl. Otherwise
you start to lose track of time.
Faces, places. Even
your own name.

I can't.

Most blood-born, shall we say,
contagions... they affect
the body. This affects
everything else.

What about animal blood?

That's anemia. That's
a slow death.

That's not gonna cut it.

When the time comes, you'll
know what to do.

Besides, Job did his whole
submissive, dominatrix
dance with his Creator,
and didn't get shit.

At least you'll get laid.

Oh... Oh, Jesus...
Fucking Chirst!

Can you feel her?

No.

Concentrate.

Her perfume.

What about it?

It's bad.

She's at the...
Coming!

Hello?

Hey there.

Hi.

Open
it... Open it...

Are you gonna let me in?

Open
it... you've gotta!

Yeah, I mean. Yeah,
of course, I'll let
you in. Course I'll
let you in...

DO IT!

Okay!

What's the matter?

Nothing... nothing.

Aww... uh huh, No need
to be nervous.

You're right. I'm,
I'm, I'm sorry...

Uh, don't be sorry.

Um... Do you have a toilet?

Uh, yeah... it's... uh...

Are you okay?

Uh huh.

What's wrong with your lip?

Oh, no. Uh... nothing,
nothing... nothing.

Okay.

I'm... I'm gonna make
a quick call.

Yeah.

She's
not calling anyone.

I know.

You can feel it,
can't you? You can feel her.

She's got no one to call.

What
else do you feel?

She's got a kid.

SOFIA Ignore that.

A boy.

Ignore it!

She doesn't know where he is.

So
she's got no one.

No.

Perfect. Hah.

She's AB Negative.

Good.

Smells thick... Like
Maraschino cherries.

What
does that tell you?

I don't know.

You got this.

I don't know!

Concentrate.

High glucose.

She's hyperglycemic.
Never given blood.

Very good.

She's had gonorrhea.

Doesn't matter.

I don't like it.

You will.

Her perfume is terrible...
Candy?

Oh! Heh. Hi there.
Are you peeking?

Sorry... sorry... sorry.

No problem. We all
have our kinks.

I'm sorry.

Mister Shy-Guy, Mister Shy-Guy,
Mister Shy-Guy.

Um...

How about a drink?

No, that's cool.

Wine?

No, no. Its okay.

C'mon.

No, it's okay. Really.

Soda. I got soda.

Oh...

Uh, in a can?

Of course.

And it's in there...? Okay.

Uh, sorry I don't
have any... Diet.

Oh, that's all right.

Regular is fine.

Just, you know, that's
a lot of sugar.

Yeah.

Wow. Thirsty girl.

Uh huh.

Do you have a trash?

I, uh... I recycle.

Oh...! Oh, which one is it?

It's the, uh, the...

It's the small one?

Yeah? Hahahaha. Oh, my
god, you're so cute!

Mmm... You know, I used to have
a bae, and he had three
big bins, but they were like
all sorts of colors

for all his shit.
But they were big
though, like they were
big, I mean BIG big.

Yeah, it's pretty common.

Oh, I don't think so.

Yeah, no... it, it is...
it's standard.

Standard?

Uh, pretty standard.
Look, I, um...Look,
I gotta tell you something.

Hey!

Hey, who's that? Is that your
sister...? Cause she's hot.

She's, uh... she's out of town.

Yeah? Relax. Let's get this
shirt off. You know, you've
got me for an hour, but
you could have me for

the whole night for $200.

Yeah...? Cool.

Yeah? You got the cash?

Yeah, I got it.

Do you want the $200?

Yeah, I got all that.

Okay, baby... Let's
do some shots.

Shots?

Yeah, let's do some shots.

Hey...!

Everything okay?

Hey, I put a record
on the player.
Got something
better here.

Oh, shit. Is that the
shit?
Let's, um, let's party.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's party.

Ah, I like it.

Hahaha.

Mmm... this is gonna be juicy.

Tell me something.
What up?

Candy is not your real name.

Sure, it is.

No, it's not. I know it's not.
Okay, how do you
know that?

I can smell it.

Okay, that's really weird.

Why is that weird? - Well,
it's just really weird.
I mean, but I like weird, so...

Hah.

So what's your real name?

What do you want it to be?

Why do you...? Why do you...?

C'mon, just lay back.

You shouldn't have left him.

What...? What're you
talking about?

He's your son.

Who the fuck are you?

You gotta call him.

What...? What the
fuck is going on?

I'm sorry. You should go.

Shit! - What? What's
going on? What is it?

Um... where's my shirt?

Fuck your shirt!

Hold on!

Where's my money?

It's gonna be okay.

Mom?!

What're you doing?

I have to tell you something...
Who are you?

I... I... I'm...

Uh, this is Candy, mom. She's...

Your father is dead.

Oh, shit.
Crate?!

I didn't know where else to go.

Hang on, hang on...
I'm sorry.

WHO'RE YOU?!

Hang on. Crate wasn't even
sick. Mom, Mom...

What happened? Just
tell me. Mom?!

Hey, hey. Give her a
second. Sit down.

There was an accident.
I was in the car...
He was driving. They said
he didn't suffer.

My dad died in a car accident.

I know.

Mmm, that was fun.

You crazy cunt.

Oh... don't act so precious.

C'mon... it's supper
time.
supper time... supper time...

Good morning, honey.

What's wrong, honey?

Fuck you.

Man, you need to lighten up.

Lighten up?

Okay, I get it. Ground rules.

I'm gonna kill you.

How?

Saved by the dinner bell.

That's not gonna happen.
Not gonna be anymore

goddamn dinner bells.

Oh, yeah? Wait till
you throw up that
breakfast I made you. Believe
me, it's not because

of my cooking.

Hello...? Yeah, Sparks
and Third...
In an hour. Yeah, got it.

Why do you keep doing that?

You don't owe anyone
anything, anymore.

Told you. Feel free to leave.

I'm not gonna do that.

I love you.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Wow. You know, you're
an asshole!

Oh, I'm the asshole?

That guy is not worth your time.

No shit. But I'm not giving
up on my mom or
my life or any of it,
just to please you.

That's what I thought, until
my dad tried to burn
me at the stake.
Oh, yeah? What'd you do?

Take a wild guess.

You don't even know me.

Universal donor...
Inflamed veins.

That's nothing.
It's nothing.

Came from The Scots. Clan
Ronald Mc-fucking-
Donald. You're a clown! Yeah,
right. I don't know you.

What?

Got an idea.

Okay, now you're just
fucking with me.

What the fuck are you
supposed to be? Some
sort of fucking weird mime?

Yeah, Massimo the
Mime. Who're you?

I'm Gage. As far as
you're concerned...

I'm your guardian fucking angel.
Drive, mother fucker.

Whatever.

There's a virus out there.
The world... has gone
bug-house.

Tell me about it.

Chinks, fucking eating monkey
brains. They found an elephant
with syphilis.

Who in their right mind
would fuck an elephant?

There goes my Friday night.

I got it, I got it. Listen...

If somebody was to fuck
an elephant...
You know, I
could put on some music...

The right person for
that job is Crate!

Yeah, Crate is right-as-rain.

Yeah, you're lucky.
Oh, yeah? How's that?

Crate... Takes care of his
own... Took care of me
when I was in prison.

You were in prison?

Never thought twice.

What were you in for?

Doesn't fucking matter.
Telling you,
your dad's a fucking saint, kid.

He's not my dad.

He's not your fucking dad?
That's fucking cold,
kid. Ice cold. Fuck.

You should probably work on
that fucking attitude.

Yeah! You're probably right!

You know, it's all right.
I'd do anything
for fucking Crate. Fuck you.

So, Massimo. How's this go?

Grab the stuff.

Yeah.

Go to the unit.

And then? - That's it.

Is it?

What's the supposed to mean?

I mean, you're out here
all day. - So?

So, four to six hours is a long
time. It costs us money, kid.

It's a full tank out
here. I gotta eat.

And that's it?

You want a fucking inventory, or
something? Like a manifest? Like
I'm some fucking trucker,
or something?!

You need to calm down,
sweetheart.

Fuck!

Fucking cunt.

Cigarette?

Nah, man.

...Fuck.

Yeah, I remember this place.
16-years-old, doing
runs through here.

Young, dumb, and full of
cum. Right over there.
Used to be a whorehouse.
Everything legal.

You could do anything.

You think that's
what's going on?

You tell me I'm wrong.

Haha! Ha...! You got me!

Yeah, boy.

Guilty as charged.

You like that freaky-deaky
shit, huh?

Freaky-deaky.

That explains the get-up.

They got a pill for that
these days, young man.

So who's your favorite?

Favorite?

Everybody's got a
favorite bitch.

Candy.

Candy... Sounds sweet.

She was.

Was?

Not gonna see her anymore.

Well... She sounds like one
stacked pancake. She
look anything like this?

How did you get those?

Cuz, cocksucker. That's
my fucking job.

Listen...

We know you've been
tasting, kid.

No, I don't.

No... you don't? - Nope.

No, you don't
take a taste?

No.

You stupid fucking cocksucker!

Are you fucking telling
me you don't
fucking taste?!
No, sir!

Look at me, you fucking
little junkie!

You think I'm a clown like you?!
Huh? You think I'm a fucking
clown? I see the

track marks on your fucking
arm...! Huh?!

You think I can't smell
the cancer? - The
fuck did you just say, weirdo?

You got a year... tops.

Fuck you, you little cocksucker!

The fuck you think you
are, you fucking

piece of shit!

Hahaha! Look at you , motherfucker.
Your dad was too much
of a pussy to do what
needed to be done.

Not me, motherfucker.
Good night.

Christ!

You fucking bit me,
you cocksucker!

Goddamn. Fucking homo.
You fucking bit me?!

What the fuck?

Queer fucking bit me.

Fucking cocksucker.

Shhh... shhh, it's okay.

Tien? Are you here?

All right.
Are you here?

For now.

I can't see. - I know.
It's gonna be okay.

What is that smell...? Oh, god.

What did I do? What is that smell? Oh,
my god. What did I do? Oh, shit.
Oh, god. Someone, please,
someone help me.

Well, it is about time for you
to lay in your native soil.

Shhh. I'm right here.

Stop it!

What?

You're not her.

What the fuck is this?
It's calming.

Well, aren't you hot
shit? I can't see

fuck all in here.

I gotta use the can.
Where's it at?

Yo! Earth to fuck-head.

I heard you. - Then
you know what to do.

What's that? - Answer me.

I did.

You didn't say shit.

And that was my answer.

Fuck you.

You got eyes.

No, you answer me when
I talk to you.

Piss yourself.

How's that?

You do it all the time anyway.

Say that again. Say it again!

Kidney's aren't what
they used to be.

You son of a bitch.

Lot of blood in that piss.

How'd you know that?

You oughta
get that checked.

I oughta kill you.

I'd like to see you try.

Look at this place.
Fucking pigsty.

So who's this tough fuck?
You know, when you
were a kid, you had
some respect.

Kids are stupid.

No. Kids listen. They understand.
Jesus, Mary,
and Joseph. I mean, have
you learned nothing?

Not a goddamn thing.

That just makes me
tired all over.

Guess you wasted your
time. - Did I?

Besides that was a lifetime
ago. - Not to me.

Cause you're old.

See, what is that?
What?

This smart-ass, piss-poor
mouth of yours.

New me, I guess.

How can you be so arrogant?
I gave you everything.

You didn't give me shit.
Your whole life.

Get in line. - I made you.

Didn't do a very good job.

That breaks my heart.

Nah, I think the cholesterol
will take care of that.

Shut up! What I do is
between me and God!

And the DNA of the 53
women you fucked...

54, if this new blonde
works out.

What is this psychic shit, man?
Where are you getting this?

Look, how would you like it
if I told you something
that you don't want to hear.
Thrill me.

About your mom. - My mom?

She sleeps next to me
every night. Okay?

And I got all the numbers,
all the addresses.

Good for you.

Including that little
piece. Tien.

You think
that's leverage?

I got more.

I'm shaking.

Yeah, you should be... Tien
know about your moonlighting?

Oh, you mean the whore.

I bet she doesn't.

So tell her.

Just like that?
Doesn't mean shit to me.

I'm not buying it. No, that's
not gonna cut it.

Not trying to cut it.
You can't protect her.

I don't care.

Don't try to poker face me.
You don't have the face.

One call. One text.

I press one button, and those
two are best friends.

You act like you're talking
to Messy Massimo

right now... Everything's
changed.

Just like that?
All bets are off.

I don't believe that.
In fact, if I was you

I'd be pissing myself.

I'd be fucking shaking.

You got nothing.

And what do you got? What's
with this attitude? You got
an ace up your sleeve?

sleeve

Is she here? That's it, isn't
it? Son-of-a-bitch.

Tien...? Tien?!

Hold it!

Cute.

Get over there.

So now what?

What was that?

Just marking my territory.

This was meant to be a social
call. All right?

Nice and civil.
With a gun.

Is that how you took care
of my associate?

The hit man?

It was a friendly conversation.

Also with a gun.

So what happened to him?

Like you said. All friendly.

What happened to Gage?

Gage had it coming.

Look, I put my ass on the line
for you for 20 fucking years.

That's just the blink of an eye.

I went into the arena

over and over. I was
your gladiator.
Gladiators die.

You could've been a Made Man.

But now...

You're just an asshole.

You're the one who sent Gage.

Believe me... I didn't
want that.

But you got sloppy. Now, I'm
gonna make a deal with
you. Same deal I made
with your Dad.

You're gonna walk out that
door. You're gonna go down
to Mexico, and you're gonna
never come back.

No calls. No contact. Just
gone forever, all
right? Otherwise, you're
gone forever.

Just like that?

You disappear. -In a puff of
smoke, poof. What's your
answer? -Fly away on
leathery wings.

Don't be an idiot.

What deal did my Dad take?

Bet I can grab that gun
faster than you... No.
Here. Put your hand out.

You're a dumb shit.

One... - Don't
make me do this.

Oh, I'm gonna
get the gun.

Oh, you think so?

It's what it is... Two...

I never liked you.

THREE!

Chewy.

No, no, no, no! No!

Relax.

What did you do? - A favor.

Oh, my god! - He
was going to kill you.

He killed your father.

You're lying!

You know, it's true...
You can hear it.

No, no, no.

The voices.

Stop it!

The transformation is complete.

Get out of my head!

What're you doing?

It's over.

No! We're the last ones!

You need me.

You need me.

I'll take my chances.

You know...

Your blood is as good
as gold to me.

Maybe the most precious
thing in the world.

But I think I'm just gonna
let it run out.

Because I'm done taking
anything from you.

You're nothing but a waste.

Massimo?

Hey, babe.

Where are you?

Home, sweet home.

Are you alone?

For now.

Okay, great. Stay there.
I'm coming over.

I'm not going anywhere.
There's
something I gotta tell you.

It's your funeral.

Where are you?

What's the matter?

Nothing, I... - You
waiting for an invitation?

You did that all by yourself.
That's good, I think.

Massy... You okay?
Never better.

You want, um, You want something
to drink? I mean, everything's
kind of laying around here, so... I
mean, I tell ya... It's been hell.

No! Nothing! I'm... I'm fine!

And the bottle of Chorazos is
already gone. It's just gone.

I have been so worried
about you.

So you don't want some wine?
Forget the wine!

What's going on...?
Have you been sick?

More or less.

Oh, yeah. You feel cold.

Do you have any other symptoms?

What're you a doctor now?

Well, ever since you
broke up with me...

It's hard for me to focus
on anything else.

Let it go.

You know, I've been thinking
about what you said.

The text I sent you.

Yeah, about the tests.

And?

It's gonna be hard for you
to hear, but I went and
I took them. All of them.
There were about ten.

I even took the AIDS test.

And they found... nothing.

That's something.

Wait, there's more.

You should go.

Just listen to me.

Please, just go.

I'm not leaving.

You're lucky it didn't get you.

You're not listening to me.

Stay here and something bad
is gonna happen to you.

The hospital... They
ran a DNA test.

DNA test?

I gave them some
of your clothes.
They found something
really rare.

Holy shit!

You can't stay here!

Wait! - She's coming.
She's coming...

She's coming... She's
coming... Sofia is...

There is no Sofia!

What?!

No, no, you...

Just listen to me.

You saw her!

When?

When she said I couldn't
see you.

There is no Sofia.

You talked to her.

I was talking to you.

What's going on?

Get... Get away! Just get away!

Honey? Who is that? Who're
you talking to?

Get away, get away, get away.

Sofia.

Who are you talking to?

Who are you?

Um... I'm Tien... Who are you?

Who are you...? Who are you...?
There's... she's, um...

She's...

Tien, there's something...
There's
something I need to tell you.

I was talking to you,
Massy. We were on the
phone. You were talking
to no one. There was

no one there. You were
talking to no one.

But that's not what happened.

You don't remember?

I saw... I saw...

What did you see?

There... there was
this creature.

What?

I won't let it take you.

Massy...

Where did you see this creature?

I can't remember.
I can't remember.

I can't remember.

I can't remember,
I can't remember,
I can't remember.

I can't... I can't remember.
I can't remember.

It happened that night.

When we made love.

Yes, yes. That's it...
We were in bed. We
started talking about
the Penanggalan.

Crate knew my Dad.

Helped set me up. Odd
jobs, here and there.

Hey... what's... what's wrong?

Hey... what's going on...?
What's the matter?

Baby?!

Are you okay?!

What's going on? Babe!
Are you okay?!

Baby, what's going on?

What's wrong?!

You disassociated for an hour.

I did?

You didn't remember anything,
like nothing
had ever happened.

But then... we were
good for a while.

And then that Sofia thing
started happening.

Break it off.

What?

You heard me.

You can't be serious.

This is not open to discussion.

Fuck you!

I'm so sorry, Tien.
I'm so sorry.

Shhh, it's not your fault.

Don't you see it?
She is playing you.

For the money.
For my money!

I had to protect you.

Oh, god...

You know, I found out
about your father.

He went to Mexico... he's dead.

I know. I'm sorry.

You're gonna walk out that door.
You're gonna go down to Mexico.

You're gone forever.

Crate killed him.

No, no, no...

He died in a hospital.

What...? What?

He must've found out he had
the same thing you did.

What're you talking about?

It's a rare genetic disease.

No... no...

It affects the nervous system.
Causes hallucinations.
Blackouts. It's hereditary.

Hereditary?!

He must've been trying to find
a cure. That's why he left.
They didn't know what it
was about back then.

All the things I've seen, they
were just... Oh, my god!

Don't you see? None of
this is your fault.

You were born with it!

Everything I've done!

But you haven't done anything.

Oh, my god...

You take these pills. You
take them twice a day.
They stop the hallucinations.
You don't have to

live this way. There's a cure.

There's no cure!

Baby... I'm not going anywhere.

Nice try... you cunt!

Ahh!

I'm gonna kill you.

It's... not... real.

Stop it!

You're not Tien! You're
not Tien!

Please...

...stop...

I'm gonna rip your
fucking face off!

Oh, my god.

I'm so sorry, I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry, I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry, I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

It's okay. It's okay.

You're just sick.

You're just sick.
