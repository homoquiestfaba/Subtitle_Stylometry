Have you seen Francis?
-No, not lately.

It has been a while, right?

The social worker asked you
to come by.

Shut up. I don´t have the
right to anything.

There is mail for you.
Should I bring it?

You have been gone for 5 days.
Don´t you want to live together anymore?

Because I go out late, I don´t
want to move yet. Stop whyning.

Did you come here to drink something,
we haven´t talked in a while.

Have you got any money?
-Yes, I´ll buy. Where are we going?

Give up, I´ll play again.

You know that girl?
-Sure. A first class whore.

I believe that immediately.
Can´t you introduce me to her?

Nadine, phone for you.
It´s Francis.

Don´t stand there like that,
I´ll lose my concentration.

Will you be late tonight?
-I don´t know. Stop whyning.

There´s nobody here.

It´s a week now.
Its ok.

Manu...

Manu, come please.
Where is Radouan?

Where is Radouan?
-Come here.

Are you watching that junk
again?

I thought you wouldn´t come to eat.
-Shut down that tv.

You are totally insane.
If you were a guy...

Go to the kitchen.

I want to finger myself here.
I have had enough of doing it in my room.

Where are the papers?
-In the basket.

Do you smoke nowadays?
-No, it´s for you.

A gift from King Radouan.

Do you deal like your brother, fucking Radouan?
-Relax.

I am relaxed.
But the whole neighbourhood is talking about it.

You are so scared that the cops
will arest you.

He´s not the type
to jump at everything.

Something happened between us.

I shouldn´t have done
it immediately the first night.

I don´t understand
why he doesn´t call back.

I think he´s affraid of me.

A girl with character scares men.
They feel less virile.

They are all sissies, that´s what they are.

Manu, come please.

You haven´t seen Radouan?
-No. We don´t live together.

Tell that dick that he´s wanted.
When we find him, he´s dead.

What did he do wrong?
-When we find that dick, he´s dead.

it´s ok.

Don´t talk like that
or you will die!

No jokes, we will come and
find you. Understand? Fuck off now.

Do you still have some stuff?
-Or did you smoke everything?

Bah, you really are hopeless.

Are we going to drink something?

Have you got any money?
-I just got my welfare.

Are you French enough
to get that? 

I'm going to my brother's.
-I don´t want to see him.

What are you still doing
with that damn junkie?

Can´t you do anything
with your shitty life?

Mind your own business.

There are always problems with you.
You are a piece of shit.

Can you lend me 300 francs?
-Your are daring.

Work. You know what that is?
-There's no work in France.

Thanks.

Come, lets go.
-Did you get hit, Manu?

You saw that. So what?
-You should have hit back.

I wouldn't take something like that.
-I am prepared for anything.

We will buy some beer and 
go for a stroll on the quay.

You want me to come?

Yes, that would be nice.

There are some things...
I need to talk to you about.

Maybe you can tell me what
I have to do.

I have an importane meeting
now...

...but I will ask what time the
last train leaves.

OK.
-You will give me the address?

Juvisy, Hôtel de la Gare.
You can´t miss it.

They have seen your porn movies.

With all those nice details,
I think it´s gross.

You help everybody,
then you have to hear something like that.

If you didn´t want to tell it,
you should have shut up.

I´d rather have you know it.
-Well, I know it now.

I could care less.
Shit on them.

Bring them to me, I´ll make 
them stand in a row and shit on them.

Give me a beer..

You want to be a rebel?

Shall I show you what
I do to rebels?

You haven´t had enough yet?

Stay down.

Take her out of there.

Lets go!

Take off your pants.
Strip or I'll kill you.

Exchange?

Turn around. On your hands and knees.
Hurry.

Shut up.

It´s like I am fucking a zombie.

Move your ass a bit.

What do you think you have
between your legs, asshole?

I´ve had enough. Bitch.

Manu. How could you?...
How could you let him take you like that?

How could you, Manu?

They can have done much worse.

Were still alive, right?

How can you say that?
How can you say that?!

Because I don´t care about
their stupid dicks.

I have had more in me.

You wouldn´t leave your car behind
with valuable stuff in it either.

I can´t keep dicks out of my pussy,
there´s nothing valuable in there.

It´s only a dick and were only
girls. It will be alright.

Damnit.

I will make you come.

You are touching my whiskey without
asking and you didn´t even put it back.

Be happy there´s still something in it.

It´s always the same.
With everything I say,

you give stupid answers.

If you want to live together,
there has to be dialog and respect.

And you can´t cope with that.

You really don´t have some stuff?

What´s up with you?
Don´t you have enough of being down?

Will you give me a Jack?
-No.

Come on.

Here you go, little princess.

Damnit asshole.

Kill him.

Waste him.

Stop it. It´s a poor guy.
-mind your own business.

Fuckers. Don´t you see he´s
a poor guy?

Don´t you see he´s whyning?
Is he your sweetheart?

Do we have to waste you too,
bitch?

Leave her alone. Understood?
I will only tell you once... ok?

You, come here.
-No. I don´t want that. They will kill him.

Come here.

Hurry up,
Mother Teresa.

Your big friend Francis called.

What do you see in that dirty junk?
-What did he say?

Nothing. He was totally stoned.
And I don´t want to see him anymore.

When did he call?

He will be here for a few days
and then he´ll squat for 3 weeks.

He makes a mess, eats everything
and spills coffee everywhere.

And he shouts at me too.

He´s whining because I threw his
stuff away...

...because when he doesn´t have enough speed,
he wants to filter it twice

I don´t want to see him again.
-Please, be quiet now.

Stop it please.

You´re a fucking idiot.

How did you get those bruises?

From dickheads like you.
They always like to hit me...

...otheriwse they don´t feel alive.

Did you have a fight again?
You´re always stoned.

They didn´t rape you, right?

You haven´t been raped, right?!

Who?
-That guy is a real pain in the ass.

He´s my best friend,
shut your fucking mouth.

Your best friend?
And you are his best slave...

...and he doesn´t give a shit about you.
Your best friend.

Who was it?
Who did it?

It doesn´t even come to your
mind, to ask how I am doing.

You are so dumb you make me puke.

You don´t look thát traumatized.
Damnit, you make me puke.

Slut..... Slut.

Good evening.

Can I have the number of Francis Godot´s
room?

Number 26, second floor.

He only payed for 1 person.

I only come for the evening blowjob.

How is it going?
-I am without Subutex.

Basic stuff.

Can you make a nice prescription for me
with nice...

...handwriting.

The above right, three boxes of eight.

I know. I have done it so many times
I know it by heart.

Didn´t be rude on the prescription. 
That will cause suspicion.

Now is not the time to 
whine to me about that.

There´s something I really can´t
forget. Do you remember Noëlle?

You know how she rode her
bike over the border, full of acid.

I have to get her false papers,
but I can´t get them.

I have to be at the Luxeuil station 
buffet on the 13th at 12 o´clock.

Where´s that?
-In the Vosges.

First class.
But I can´t be there.

You have to give her the papers.

She´s driving across the border,
with the stuff, her acid.

You have to take care of it.

Now a days there are enough
people with problems.

I am going downstairs for a while and my...
Thank you.

It´s nice of you to come.
-That´s normal, isn´t it?

Have you seen it...

...there´s pharmacy near the hotel.

You know how to choose good hotels.

I am asking you something.

At the moment there are no trains.
Insane.

This is going to be a long night.

Fuck, no trains till tomorrow
night.

You aren´t very social...
Where are you going?

To Paris.

To Paris?

Can you drive a car?
-Yes.

If you can drive, I have a car.
And I want to go to Paris.

Will you wait for me in Paris?
-Not really.

That´s convenient.

That´s very convenient.

I am in a very shitty position.

I bet you'll say again that
you´re having bad luck.

I want to see the sea. Take me there.

That´s what the car is for,
with gas to go back again.

Can I ask you something?
-What?

Have you done any porno movies?

Yes. How did you know?
Is your boyfriend a fan?

I don´t have a boyfriend.
I'm crazy about it myself.

That´s one point for you.

God damn. I'm thirsty.
Stop please, I have to drink.

Further down the road is a gas
station - There's the sign.

Good news.

But you better not do something
to me.

I really won´t do anything.

If you want, you can take the car
now and drive away.

I am going to eat. And you?

I don´t know. Eat with you.

Funny how we met eachother,
isn' it?

No, it´s not funny at all.
It was now or never.

We can see it like that too.
-We can go on a journey.

With your 10,000 Francs?
-I don´t want to go anywhere.

And I have to be in the Vosges 
on the 13th.

I don´t want to screw Noêlle.

We can stay together till then.

Too bad for her.
-Damn, I am scared.

What a funny feeling.

It´s going pretty fast actually.

You were standing to close to me. 
I could have shot off your arm.

Because of that experience were
getting better.

What did you think about it?

Immediately afterwards I felt bad.
Really bad.

I wanted to sit down and cry,
end of the world atmosphere.

But now...

...I feel very good.
I would almost feel like doing it...

Again, right?

Awkward.
We don´t know if they are looking for us.

Don't forget that 
cops are stupid by nature.

But they're also very diligent.
And we weren´t very cautious either.

You have to be sharp.

From now on we have to drink a lot.

And catch some guys.

The more you fuck...

The less you think and
the better you sleep.

What would be fun...

...is if you do 69 with us.

Fuck off.

Did you see how that dick went down.
With his expensive suit. Hello... Boom.

The face he made.
-Stupid fuck.

Where are we going?
-How would I know.

Where luck takes us.

And we´ll let the "you can fuck off" 
side of our souls go it´s own way

I have cut myself everywhere.
-It´s crazy like that.

You don´t know anything, it´s cool.

We are far from the Vosges.
We have to be there at the 13th.

What do we have to do there?
It´s far away, it´s cold and ugly.

We have an appointment there
with Noëlle, right?

Yes, I forgot.

I would advise you to use the Beretta 92f, 
with the Pachmayr grip, totally stainless steel.

It´s one of my favouite guns.

It´s very virile.
I think it´s great.

You push the magazine deep
into the end...

...you pull the sledge back,
unbolt on the side.

And the gun is ready to fire.

Remember to push the magazine
into the end hard.

Pull the sledge and unbolt 
on the side.

And if your husband....

And if his wife
likes to shoot dickheads?

We don´t have the right answers
at the right time.

But we do have the right actions.
That´s a start.

And we aren´t doing it that bad.

No. But those people are going to die.

The dialogs need to have some level.
Crucial to death.

Will we prepare some lines?
-Ofcourse not.

Then we wouldn´t have any ethics.

Don´t forget to buy some drinks.

Did you buy drinks?
-Yes.

As a kid I spilled my drinks on 
purpose to get my mom mad.

She got sick of it.

Damn, I am getting anxious to fuck.

Thanks.

You´re not playing?

You want some coins?

You will bring me some luck.

Only your dick, nothing else.
-But that´s dumb. Safe sex.

Can´t do that anymore.

I can´t do this.
It´s against my principles.

You can´t get it hard.
That´s boring.

I don´t know what´s wrong.

Maybe if you do it with your
mouth for once...

You are lucky I have a female
concious, pal.

Bitch.

That´s filthy.

I don´t get what´s so funny about that.
Damnit.

I chocked myself..

Bitches.

Filthy fucking whores.

I didn´t say you could leave.

What we didn´t like about you,
was your condom.

You have been revealed, pal.
Your a condom dick.

You can´t just go around fucking
unknown girls.

Because you never know who 
your dealing... pal

With killers of condom-dicks.

Yuck... Terror in the city.
-Is our picture included?

No one will recognize us
with that.

We are just two girls,
one big and one small.

Do you want to feel my balls
against your ass?

Fucking bastard.

Do you know the way to Biarritz?

No, I don´t see the signs.
You´ll have to tell me the way.

Me? Are you crazy? Just drive.
I have to tell you.

Will you just leave me like that?

Hello. Can we get a room?

The best looking room.
-The best...

There´s no better room.

Are there drinks in the room?
-No, but we have drinks down here.

How much?
-For the best room? 800 Francs.

This is a nice Hotel. Very nice.

OK...

See you later maybe.

Don´t you think it´s weird
that nothing is happening?

You always have strange thoughts
about "nothing happening".

That we are sitting in a hotel
doing nothing after all this.

Like everything is allowed.

Tactically, it´s not good to
think about things like that.

Right.
We have to remain mentally strong.

Why not start ruining your
Jack with Coke.

I do what I want.

Excuse me....

I am thisty.
You are thirsty? You want a beer?

Good evening.
One beer, please.

Good evening.

Where are you going?

To the room.
-I am going with you.

Thanks, bye.

Damnit.

Too bad for them.

Good evening.
-Gendarmerie.

Do you have your license and registration?
-Ofcourse

They should be in my purse.

Sorry.

I hope you are not leaving me?
I also know who you are.

For being on the run like this,
you don´t look that scared.

That´s because of our shortage
of fantasy.

You are going too far.

Everyone is scared to die or
to end up in prison.

It´s not about that.
Nobody escapes from it.

I don´t know, but on tv
they said you shot a man...

...and a woman without a reason.

Does it have a better morals
if we want money?

We don´t have extenuating
circumstances.

If I would have met you on the bus,
I wouldn´t have wondered that much.

That´s the ultimate trick.

Come, girl... Come on.

We are going to bed.

Are you coming?

Are we going to bed?

Good night, girls.
-See you tomorrow.

He reminds me very much
of my brother.

Reminds me of the house
we will get sometime.

Thank you.

You too?

Why don´t you go passed the border?

Too silly. And what would we
do somewhere else?

I don´t believe is somewhere else.

You can´t just sit here without
doing anything. That can´t be.

Yes it can.

You can´t just wait 
untill they catch you.

I am hesitating between jumping
from something or burning alive.

But to just sacrifice yourself
is too arrogant.

After our first meeting in Vosges
I vote for a jump without a cord.

It´s a miracle that we´re
still here.

I want to end it just as good
as it all started.

A joke has to have a good
point.

You will have to push me before
the jump. I´m too affraid.

I don´t get it.

Don´t worry, I will push you.

We should write the press
a letter too.

"They jumped without a cord."

Or else they will just make up something.
-Yes, communication is important.

Concentrate.
I don´t have all day.

Now I missed it.

Concentrate please.

Don´t talk to me like that.
You think your brave?

What kind of guy is it?
-An asshole. I am glad you are paying him a visit.

Did he do something to you?
-Getting on my nerves.

I wouldn´t gladly get
on your nerves.

And the volt is there.

The dick lives in a huge castle.

Good morning.
-Hello, sir.

We work for the inquiry firm Lpsos.

Would you be so kind to answer some
questions about culture-consumption?

Sure. Come in.
-Thank you.

There we go.

I am ready.

Then we can start immediately.

I don´t have a tv,
but I have heard about you.

I had someone else in my mind though.

I wouldn´t have expected
to meet you either.

I won´t ask how you know me.
-That would be misplaced.

I don´t know anyone like you.

You must be different than others.

What you do, is...

...extremely violent.

You must have suffered very much
to become violent like that.

I don´t know what you went
through...

...and I don´t know why 
I trust you.

Open the safe, pal.
-You are an open book to me.

I would be glad to make a deal
with you.

Get out of the way, asshole.

Unbelievable what he was talking
about before he opened that damn safe.

You already look a lot worse,
fucker.

No, I won´t kill you.
-Thank you.

Hey, sis...

...kill that son of a bitch.

Good evening.

Champagne, please.
-Later.

I will have a walk around
-Here.

Fuck off.
Keep your dirty hands off me!

This a fuck club here,
not a Mosque.

Act like a pig, dickhead.

Act like a pig!

Strip those pants.

Yes, they must have coffee.

And with a little luck,
we will get some bread too.

Then we can stay together.

This is not the moment to give up.
I can´t use that.

Don´t move!

Where is she?
-Back off, nothing to see here.

Don´t move.
-Please move back.

Don´t move.

Where´s your friend?
where is your damn friend?
