12 is the magic number.

12 is divine.

12 is both the beginning
and the end of time.

You must hurry.

When it comes to building clocks, father,

there is no such thing as hurry.

Leave us, please.

The nazis have made a breakthrough.

Impossible.

The prophesies are True.

The end times are here.

The scriptures say,
"There shall be upon this earth

"a distress of nations.

"the power of heaven shall be shaken.

"Nation will rise against Nation,

kingdom against kingdom."

Luke 4:22. You know your apocalyptic verse.

Claims of the end of
days are as old as time.

Ever since the apostles wrote
those lines 2,000 years ago,

every generation had thought it
applied to them and them alone,

and every time, they've been wrong.

Yes, but never before have the dead arisen.

Make eye contact with no one.

The nazis
appropriated this place a year ago.

They began their experiments
almost immediately.

Were it not for our unnamed "Friend,"

We would never have known.

It's only a child.

Born of no womb.

Run!

Hey!

Halt! Halt!

Halt!

Halt!

The nazis cannot be stopped now.

They will come for us.

Then we must fight back.

We are too weak to fight back.

But we may not be in the future.

As Rosicruicians,

we know the most important
thing for us to do now

is to preserve that thing

that lies in the tunnels
below this cathedral.

We can't do this.

A hundred generations have kept it hidden.

We're not worthy to make this decision.

If we don't, and it falls into nazi hands,

it will mean the end of
mankind as we know it.

There is an SS convoy
two minutes behind me.

If we leave now, we might still beat them.

Praise god for you, brother.

That's it.

Godspeed.

They're here!

Barricade it!

It is up to god now.

Not even god Can help anymore.

Only the 12 can.

â™ª So we'll start slow â™ª

Seriously, you gotta try this.

No, seriously,
I don't I have to try it.

You don't even know what
kind of meat that is.

And I don't care...

on account of its deliciousness.

Well, careful 'cause you
got a little hoof there

in your teeth.
Mm? I like it.

Yeah?

It's your fault

'cause you introduced
me to street food.

Yeah, that was when we were
young and in New Delhi.

Where, it turns out,

they're not known for
their health inspectors,

and you ate everything off the carts.

Well, that was before.
Before what?

Before I had something to lose.

Hmm.

You're never gonna
lose me, Hank Galliston,

no matter how hard you try.

All right, then.

Let's go back and get six
more with everything.

Come on. We got shopping to do.

What is it today,
parts or pieces?

We're hunting for treasure.

I mean, look at this.

Imagine what's it's seen, the
hands it's passed through.

Any way to find out who?

Not really. I mean,
things just wind up here.

You know, found in someone's
attic after they die

or picked up in a garage sale.

Their stories lost to history...

Really?

Making fun of me now?

No! I'm not making fun.

I'm making fun with you,
'cause, like, we're a team.

Oh, is that it?
Don't you have, like,

a, you know, magazine to be putting out?

I should be getting back.

I have played hooky long enough.

Well, I'm gonna be at the
shop later if you wanna...

you know,

play a little somethin' else.

It's a deal.

I love you.

I love you,

even with my hoof breath.

See ya, honey!

Hello!

We're on deadline!

Who has got a story to pitch?

Well, we've got a ton of news
feeds coming out of Romania

about a family of werewolves.

Werewolves? Come on, guys.

What do I tell every reporter
on their first day of work?

Don't start with the headline.

Start with the facts.

Which is why we're starting
with these facts...

That there are people with

a really inappropriate
amount of body hair.

Mm-hmm.

They're also the symptoms
of hypertrichosis,

a congenital condition

that causes uncontrollable
hair growth.

It's the same thing
that brought us...

Julia Pastrana,

the "Werewolf woman."

Been doing this a long time,

and one of the
things I've learned

is that the first answer
might not be the right one.

But it could be the answer
to selling more magazines.

People dig a little
mystery, Hank...

a tease, an intellectual
reach-around...

Things like spontaneous
combustion in Budapest.

Or... Or skunk apes in Arkansas.

I swear, you put one of
these on the cover...

No, you know what?

I am not gonna pay for you to
go skunk aping in Arkansas.

Well, it's really not
as dirty as it sounds.

And the point is, if you send us,

you get to chill at home
with Laila for the weekend.

Yeah, and we'll stay in one
room to keep costs down.

No, we won't.

What would make
Laila and I happiest

is knowing that our favorite
reporters are safe,

typing in their laptops,
in Brooklyn.

Right, because tothing dangerous
ever happens in Brooklyn.

The answer's still "No."

Okay, fine, but, you know, when The Post
scoops up this whole skunk ape story,

just remember who was there
at the beginning. - Okay.

Hey there.

Shh! There's somebody
in the shop.

What are you talking about?

Laila?

They're trying to get in.
Hold on. Talk to me.

Call the police.
Honey, call the police!

Hey, Arron, call the
police. Don't ask.

Just get 'em to Laila's shop now!

Okay, listen, I'm on
my way. Okay?

You hear me?

They're breaking in.

Laila, what's going on?

I've gotta fight 'em. There's
nothing else I can do.

No, no, do not fight them! Okay?
I'll be there in two minutes.

Laila?

Aah! Laila!

Laila?

Laila!

How'd you get in?

Call the police. Honey,
call the police! Aah!

All right, Mr. Galliston,
we have your statement.

When a D.I.C. gets assigned to
the case, you'll get a call.

Wait, wait. You're telling me we're
still waiting on a detective?

We're doing everything we can.

You just asked me
seven generic questions

and took pictures on an
8-year-old cell phone.

That's everything that you can?

Sir.
I-I'm sorry,

but it just doesn't add up.

I mean, if they
wanted easy money,

there's a liquor store
right down the street.

Big money... There... There's
an art dealer next door.

Laila repaired old timepieces,

which, as far as I can tell,
none of them are missing.

In fact, the only thing that is
missing right now is my wife!

No. It's all right. It's okay.

We're gonna find her, Hank.

Laila would've taken the train
back from the Flea Market

to the shop, right?

Yeah. She... She hates taxis.

She's always saying it's cheating.

Okay, so it probably would've
been the "L" or the "G," right?

You know, they've got
surveillance cameras

at almost every station now.

Maybe whoever did
this was following her.

Hank?

Sorry.

Just, we keep asking "how."

If we want answers,
we have to ask "Why."

W-Why her?

Why the shop?

"Why" will drive
you crazy, Hank.

She must've come home before
she went to the shop.

Sorry to come by so
late, Mr. Galliston.

We're here to discuss the
incident on Bedford Avenue.

FBI?

We would've called
first, but we...

No, no, no. It... It's fine.
Please, come in.

No, I grabbed these because
I figured the could help.

I just felt like I had to...
Had to do something.

Well, it looks like

you guys were doing a
whole lot of "something."

Oh, this is where you
tell us to back off,

let you do your job?

No, no, no. This is where
I say, "I get it."

When you lose someone
that you love,

the hardest thing
is to do nothing.

May I?

Police have any new leads?

Not as many as we do.

I don't understand.

We don't know much about
your wife, Mr. Galliston,

but we know quite a bit
about who might have her.

You see, we've been
working on this case

for a very, very long time.

This was taken

from the traffic camera across
the street from the shop.

Is that him?

Oh, God.

Laila.

Who is he?

Name "White Vincent"
mean anything to you?

No.

He started out as
French Foreign Legion,

ended up the highest-end
mercenary in the world.

He's on every no-fly
list that we've got.

The fact that he's
operating on U.S. soil

is obviously a problem.

What would a guy like that
be doing taking my wife?

Actually, that was gonna
be my question to you.

W-What do you mean?

Well, there's only so
much we can tell

from credit card receipts,
travel records,

about a woman, and so I...
A woman?

You... You're talking
about Laila?

She's the victim here.

Well, that's certainly
how it would appear,

but part of my job is to
look beyond appearances.

I believe you do the same
thing at your magazine.

So we were wondering if you
had any other information

that might help us conduct
our investigation.

Investigating who?

My wife is not a terrorist.

She owns a clock shop.

And yet she's been kidnapped

by one of the world's
most dangerous men.

You don't find that odd?

You know, you had me
when you came in here

with your "fed with a
heart of gold" thing.

That was a nice touch.

She means something to him.

I need to know what
that something is.

We can help each
other find Vincent.

We want the same thing.

Unless you have something
more for me,

I gave the police
my full statement.

You can get it from them.

I think you know what to do

should anything additional
occur to you.

Hmm.

Hank, are you okay?

Laila Must've bought this today.

What are you doing?

Guy was looking for something.

Typical movement.

Bushings.

Clicks. Gong wire.

You're with somebody long
enough, you soak stuff up.

Escapement.

Regulator.

Quartz.

Quartz isn't right.

Hey, what's that?

A diamond.

And suddenly, we have a motive.

Pretty tiny motive.

And a...

flawed one at that.

Um, Hank?

If that's not a motive,

then... maybe this is.

What?

And if I'm not mistaken,

that right there is
a treasure map.

I'm telling you, that is
definitely a treasure map.

It's not a treasure map.
Treasure maps don't exist.

They were invented
by Robert Louis Stevenson,

and then the myth was cemented
by "B" Hollywood movies.

Uh, "Goonies" was
not a "B" movie.

Well, then what else
would it be then?

Okay.

I'm gonna say... near Eastern.

Old. Mm-hmm.

If we could read the
writing, which we can't,

it would tell us what
this map leads to.

Well, I think I know
where this is going.

If you can't do something
yourself, find somebody who can.

The priest.

You have any idea what
you've got here?

The language is...

a dead strain of Demonic,

reserved only for
the priestly elite.

But it doesn't fit 'cause
that language died

in the 2nd Century.

2nd Century?

We're looking at a map of
the Western hemisphere.

They didn't know about
the Western hemisphere

in the 2nd Century.

Meaning, some wing of the Church
has secretly been using it

for 2,000 years.

We're rewriting history
books here, Hank.

But it doesn't explain Vincent.

I mean, why would a mercenary
like that want this?

'Cause it's a treasure map?

Doubt it.

The Rosicruicians weren't
the materialist sort.

Rosicruicians?

A secret society of
Christian mystics.

They're still in existence,
hidden throughout society,

readying themselves
for the Apocalypse.

Father, that spot on the map...

if it's not treasure,
then what is it?

"New Bartholomew."

A city?

A city? Not... Not with
these coordinates.

This is in the Arctic Circle.

Hello?

She says you have the clock.

Please, just tell me.
Is she okay?

Do you know, Henry
David Galliston,

that you lived before?

You're just a shadow of the
past cast forward in time.

Is she okay?

Your name is no more "Henry"
than mine is... you know,

whatever they're
calling me these days.

I don't know what you're talking about.

It's good that you don't, brother,

because if you knew the real
truth, you'd lose your mind,

as I've lost mine.

Listen to me. Okay, uh...

The, uh... I'll do you a solid.

Okay, the FBI is onto
you in a big way.

So why don't you just let her go?

Okay? No... No...
No harm, no foul.

Oh, there's plenty of harm here,

plenty of foul.

What are you doing?

No, no, no!

Don't hurt her!

The clock comes to me on this day,

or she dies...

On this day.

No!

Yes! Yes!

Yes. Just... please don't hurt her.

The park, between Pine and 23rd.

Bring the clock at 4:00.

And, Hank,

you've seen enough films

to know not to get
the police involved.

If I could still advise caution?

Now what we have here is a
profound historical import.

To yield it to a madman...

We're talking about my wife here.

This guy's a pro.

We mess with him, she's dead.

I've known you since grade school.

I married the two of you.

This is not easy for me to say.

But if the guy's a pro,

you think he's gonna let
someone who can I.D. him go?

Then what?

We've got the one thing

motivating him to keep her alive.

We stop him before he
gets it, she might live.

He wants the clock, we
bait him with the clock,

but we hold on to the diamond.

What's he's asking?

Cash. Lots of it.

Vincent's got swimming
pools full of cash.

Maybe he wants another one.

Why does it always feel like
I'm playing poker with you,

Mr. Galliston?

It would be so much easier if
you just tell me the truth.

I am telling you the truth.

Of course.

Tell you what.

As long as your info gets us Vincent,

I'm gonna pretend like I
actually believe you.

This is your rendezvous spot,

which we're pretty certain
he'll be nowhere near.

Good choice... Half a dozen
30-story buildings

with direct sight lines.

A couple of hundred
windows per building,

and suddenly he's in any
one of a thousand places,

waiting to see if you've
engaged law enforcement.

When he sees that you're
alone... And you will be...

Your phone will ring,

and he will give you the
real rendezvous spot.

We will be sitting on that call,
we will locate him from it,

and we will bring him down.

My wife comes first. I
wanna be clear about that.

I can't promise you that.

I can promise that
we'll do our best.

I can also promise you that
this will be your best

and maybe only chance of
getting your wife back alive.

I want you to take it.

No, I couldn't.

Keep it locked in
the parish safe.

Okay? I want it a million
miles away from the drop.

It's the only leverage we have.

Anything hits the fan...
Anything... You call me.

We're gonna get her back.

All right?

You don't have to scrub me.
I'm... I'm all alone.

"Scrub" you?

God bless you and your
Hollywood films.

The monument 200 yards ahead
of you... Get there, please.

Skype number. He's doing
it through the Internet

so we can't track the cell's G.P.S.

Smart but not genius.

The Internet leaves a footprint.

We go after the router.

Exactly.

158 Pine.

We have a hit on the top floor.
I'm on my way.

Blanket anything within
100 feet of that signal.

Yeah?
Good.

One more stop, and the game
of red rover will be over.

Come around to the
other side of the park.

There's a coffee shop
around the corner.

That's right. Just like that.
Keep on coming.

Sorry?

Keep on walking.

You mean like I-I am right now?

Yes. Just like you're
walking right now. Hurry.

He can't see me.

Something's off.

Clear.

Clear!

Where is she?!

Where is she?

He was broadcasting to
somewhere else.

He wanted to distract us...

Because what he
wanted wasn't here.

He knew somehow.

Mickle!

No!

Mickle?

Hey.

Help!

You're gonna be okay. You're gonna
make it. You hear me?

What are they saying?

They're saying it's not good.

Mr. Galliston!

Unh-Unh. We are done.

I told you it wasn't certain.

You told me you could put a trace on him,

and now he's in the wind.

He... He got what he wanted.

And what exactly is that?
Don't start with me.

Poker time is done. We
checked your bank account.

Financially, you are
a dust mite to him.

This was never about money.

You wanna arrest me? Arrest me.

But what you should
be doing right now

is looking for a killer... One
who, at this very moment,

is probably putting a
bullet into my wife's head.

Don't believe that.

Don't believe what you just said.

He doesn't need us
anymore, Rachel.

He got what he wanted.
He doesn't need Laila.

Hank...
It's logic.

A guy like that, he
eliminates loose ends.

Well, then screw logic, Hank.

Logic is the compass...

That as of right now

will get you exactly nowhere.

He's right.

Now it's all about believing.
You've just gotta believe.

After all this, she wants
me to have faith.

Yes.

You've got two ways you can go.

You can believe she's
dead and quit,

or you can believe she's
alive and find her.

Even if I have faith,

it's not gonna
create any options,

which we have absolutely
none right now.

That's not true.

Okay.

Think about it.

There's only one place left

that we could possibly
find him and Laila...

New Bartholomew,

whatever the hell that is.

I'm in.

Arrange travel.

With pleasure.

For me and me only.

Whoa. Whoa. What?
Wait.

You are better served investigating

who made the clock.

Where that thing came from
may answer the "Why,"

because If for whatever reason I
come back here without Laila,

I'll need another lead

and another lead
and another lead

until we find her. Got it?

Yeah.

Oh, and everything happens
in this office...

On the phones, online.

No flights. Not even a text.

I'm telling you, it's a
mistake not to bring us.

It's a bigger mistake
to get you hurt.

I've had enough collateral
damage on this one

to last a lifetime.

Flight gets you into
Whitefish, and then you've got

a 200-Mile drive across
the tundra after that,

where you can hire
a pontoon plane

to fly you the rest of the way.

If you leave now, you can
just make your flight.

Thank you.

Good luck.

Huh. Figured I wasn't done with you.

We're just finding it very curious

why a man who's in the
throes of an abduction case

is flying off to Canada.

What's in Canada, Mr. Galliston?

Bunch of ice, lots of beer,
reindeer. There's...

Hey, quit being pigheaded!

I'm with the FBI. I could
be a resource to you.

I don't trust you, lady.

Feeling's reciprocal.

Tell me what you
see, Mr. Galliston.

A Fed looking for glory,

trying to bring down number
one on the Watch List.

Maybe you see a
social counselor...

An ex-social counselor that
would like nothing better

than to be a social
counselor again.

Maybe you see a widow.

Russiyana 71 mean
anything to you?

No.

It was a flight that went
down outside of Moscow

four years ago.

All 270 people onboard died.

They blamed it on
Chechen separatists.

Guess who the bomb maker was.

Vincent.

My husband was on that flight.

Condolences,

and I mean that,

but you're making a
massive assumption

about you and I being
the same. We are not.

My wife is not dead.

Change of heart?

Let's just say that

the alternative is no
longer an option.

Then you of all people
should know what it's like

to have your heart ripped out

and to listen to bureaucrats
tell you that

they're trying... Really
trying... and all the while,

that thing is out there
that did you injustice,

and nothing is gonna happen

unless you do something about it.

You're going after Vincent.

I know it, even if
I don't know how.

He's lethal.

I'm trained with a gun and I'm
licensed to travel with it.

That alone makes me
a resource to you.

If I refuse?

Well, then you're just
gonna have to pretend

that you don't see me
sitting across the aisle.

Hey.

Oh, right. Hey, come here. Check it out.

Look at this.

"Norbert Peter Steinke IV."

"Uhrmacher"? What's "Uhrmacher"?

"Clockmaker."

So you got a guy's name?

No, I got a guy.

How many Norbert
Peter Steinke IV's

you think there
are in this world?

Exactly two.

We got one in Switzerland
who's 9,

and one in Bavaria who's 93.

Guess which one's capable
of making a clock.

So you got a phone number,
an e-mail? Come on!

No, I got an address.

The only way we get to this guy

is if we do it the
old-fashioned way.

Go knock on his door.

No.

You heard what he said. We stay
right here. There's no trip.

That's adorable, but no.

No.

Taxi!

J.F.K.

He's gonna kill us.

Clock goes round and
and round and round

until one day...

It doesn't.

That day is tomorrow, dearie.

Excuse me.

Is that plane for hire?

Yeah.

Can I make it that far North?

That's right on the circle.
Something special up there?

Well, that's what
we aim to find out.

Will you fly us up there?

I'm bettin' you know the guy who
came through here yesterday,

asking the exact same thing.

Did he have an accent?

That's him. Couldn't fly
him 'cause of the weather.

Well, our friend... Did he
have a woman with him?

Didn't see one.

He coulda had one in the
four-by, I suppose.

Impression I got, he was in
such a hurry, he couldn't wait.

He was gonna drive up there if I couldn't
fly him, which, of course, is nuts.

Take you a whole day, if the
tundra's even passable.

Will you fly us?

If your money's green,
my plane's got wings.

Okay, hang a right up here.

Hi. Are you Norbert
Peter Steinke IV?

The one that made
clocks in the '30s?

Wait, Wait, wait. Hey, we
came a long way to see you.

I don't care.

But we found one of your clocks.

I've made plenty of clocks.

I think this is a special one.

Dear Lord.

Are you sure these
are the coordinates?

Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

What do you see?

I don't know.

I thought that clock
was lost to time,

and yet you have
found one of them.

You're a Rosicruician.

These are matters you don't
want to be involved with.

Trust me.

We're not leaving until
you give us some answers.

Has blood been spilled?

Yeah.

Then it is just as it was.

They are looking for
the clocks again.

Willing, again, to kill.

Clocks? As in multiples?

Talk to us. We know about
the map inside the clock.

Why did you make it? What...
What is new Bartholomew?

Is it a city?

New Bartholomew isn't
a place, you fool.

What would Vincent
think is out here?

I think the only thing that
matters is that he's on his way.

None of this makes any sense.

According to him, it isn't
supposed to make any sense.

He said I'd lose my mind.

New Bartholomew is...

Was...

Was a man.

You're telling me the map leads to a man?

Who? Why?

12 numbers on the clock.

12 men to save the world.

12 apostles.

12 apostles? What are
you talking about?

The men Christ entrusted with
the salvation of mankind.

Yes, and that happened
2,000 years ago.

No.

It was in 1938.

In 1938,

Europe was in flames.

The very future of the
world was in doubt.

So the Church...

We did something that
has never been done

in 2,000 years.

We appointed 12 new apostles...

A new Luke, a new Peter,

a new Bartholomew.

And they were given a secret...

One that not even the Pope knew.

A secret that could bring
about the end of the world.

Executed. All of them.

And if they ended up up here,

they were way, way off course.

No, they ended up exactly
where they wanted to be.

The Apostles are scattered to
the four corners of the globe

to keep that secret as far away
from the Nazis as they could.

One clock was made
for each apostle.

I made the clock for
new Bartholomew.

He was a holy man.

He was a noble man.

He was a Nazi officer.

You said that he had a secret.
What... What was it?

Only the 12 knew.

It was something hidden
beneath the cathedral.

But there were whispers

that it was a secret the
Nazis could never know

because the Nazis
had figured out

the first steps to eternal life.

They had a way

to render God irrelevant.

Do you know,
Henry David Galliston,

that you lived before?

That you're just a shadow of
the past cast forward in time?

The Nazis' reign ended,

but the experiments didn't.

Neither did the
search for those clocks.

You must find these clocks,

and you must do this

before the enemy does,

because if those
clocks resurface

and blood has been spilled,

then a storm is coming.

It will pit Science
against Religion,

country against country.

The whole world will be drawn up

into this storm.

It will be unholy

and like the world has
never, ever seen before.

And that storm is called...

Zero Hour.
