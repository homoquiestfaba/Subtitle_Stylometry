"But that was all
still to come in Maggie's den.

"The silence on the phone

"It was the silence
I still hear,

"Always in the middle
of the night

"When I'm walking down

"An empty highway,

"Or holed up in
the last darkened amtrak car,

"Looking out the window

"At the distant,
twinkling lights.

"Some call it longing,

"But I call it silence.

"That night, though,
on the phone,

"I heard my brother's voice.

"'Hello? Hello?

"'Anthony.

Hello?'"

Thank you.

[Light applause]

Thanks for coming.

From my brother, Sean.

It was great.

Oh, thank you.

Thanks.

Watch this.

Lubbock,
amarillo, fort worth...

What time you getting off?

Thanks, doll.

Thank you.

Where to next, capitan?

Hobbes.

Hobbes.

Same city, different name.

There's a college there.


No.

College?

Yeah, it's coed there.

Pussy. Sweet.

How far?

Like seven hours.

So we have time
to get a hotel tonight.

Motel.

Yeah.

Can I see that pie?

Here, Sean.

I actually ordered it for you.

You mean
'cause it looks gross

And you don't want to eat it.

What's that?

What?

What is this?

It's a souvenir.

Wildcat?
Oh, that's great.

It's a souvenir.

"He held her,

"Taking her nervous, fragile,

"And unsteady hand,

"Putting it onto
his bustling chest.

"Looking deep
into her chocolate eyes,

"Marco said,
'you're shaking esmeralda.

"'My love, don't be nervous.

I will be careful.
I will be tender.'"

I will fuck
you in the butt.

Sean.

How much
is the room gonna be?

$35.

These are free, right?

Yeah, no, go ahead.

Thank you.

203?

Yeah. You got it.

Thank you.

Upstairs to the right.

[Lock beeps]

Come on, I got to piss.

Killing me, Sean.

[Sean urinating, groans]

Yeah.

Ooh.

[Cell phone rings]

What the fuck?

[Phone beeps]

What?

Well, call her back.

Uh, can I get the key?

You want anything, or...?

No, I'm good.

All right.

[Distant moan]

Shit.


[Laughter on TV]

Oh, that's very funny.

Oh, bunny has won $17,303!


[Continues indistinct]


That new,
mystery challenger.


[Basketball commentator
speaking indistinctly]

[Telephone rings]

Hello?

Hey there.

Hi.

What are you doing?

I think you have
the wrong number.

Hmm. I think I got
the right number.

Sean, this is stupid.
I'm hanging up.

Who's Sean?

Tell me what you're doing.

I'm watching TV.

Who are you?

I'm Nicole.

Hi, Nicole.

What's your name?

Hmm. I like that name.

Davy.

Yeah, um,
it's a good name.

Listen...

Where are you calling from?

I'm in your motel room.

I don't think so.

What are you wearing?

Um, clothes, I guess.

Seriously.

Tell me.

I'm wearing
blue basketball shorts

And a gray sweatshirt.

It's, uh,
it's turned inside out.

It's my favorite sweater.

Let me ask you a question.

Yeah?

What are you wearing?

Nothing.

Okay.

Is that okay?

That I have no clothes on?

Yeah, it's okay, i...

What is this, exactly?

I'm horny, Davy.

Listen, this is weird.

I... i don't understand this.

I want to tell you
what I would do

If I had you
here with me right now.

Listen, i... i don't think
I can do this.

If you don't want it,

All you have to do
is hang up.

Well?

I'm lying on my sofa,

And I'm holding the phone
with my right hand.

I'm moving my other hand
very slowly

Down my body.

Mm.

I feel so smooth.

My fingers
are reaching my pussy now.

Mm.

I'm touching myself.

Just around the edge.

I like teasing myself
a little bit.

Yeah?

Mm-hmm.

Davy, what are you doing?

Are you there?

Yeah.

Talk to me.

Tell me what you're doing.

I'm, um...

I'm touching my privates.

Are you hard?

Yeah.

Good.

Can you do something for me,
Davy?

Can you pull down
your basketball shorts?

Pull your dick out.

What?

Come on, Davy.

Take them off...

Now.

Are they off?

Yeah.

Mm.

Tell me what
you want me to do now.

Okay, um...

I want you...

I want you
to put your fingers

Inside of yourself.


Okay.

Mm. Keep going.

And I want you to...

Put your fingers
inside of yourself

And... and push them
in and out.

And take your other hand...

Uh-huh.

And... and start rubbing

On... on your clit.

Oh, yeah?

Oh, God, Davy.

Okay.

Oh, God.
Do it faster now.

I am.

Oh.
[Moaning]

I want to...

I want to hear you.

Oh, God, okay.

Oh, I'm sucking so hard.

Oh, God,
it feels so good in my mouth.

I'm rubbing your dick
with my tongue now.

Mm,
pushing it down my throat.

Oh, my God.

I want you to do something.

Okay.

Okay.

Talk to me.

Tell me how it feels.

Oh, God.


Mm, come on, Davy.

I'm... I'm... I'm fucking
your mouth right now.

Uh-huh.

And... and it feels warm,

And you're, um...

My... my cock is hitting
the back of your throat,

And it...
It feels really nice.

Oh, it does?

Yeah.

Mm.

Oh, God.

It feels so good.

Please... please tell me
you feel good, Nicole.

Oh, God,
I feel really good, Davy.

You do?

Uh-huh, I do.


Oh, God.

Oh, God.

Are you... are you close?

Don't stop.
I won't.

I'm gonna come.

Oh, God. Me too.

Come in my mouth.

Okay.

Oh, me too.

[Both moaning]

[Both breathing heavily]

Hey.

That was great.

It was.

You have a nice voice.

I... i do?

Mm-hmm.

It's really sexy.

[Lock beeps, door opens]

Okay.

[Telephone rings]


Hello?

Mm. Miss me?

Nicole?

Dude,
who the fuck is that?

It's no one.
Go back to sleep.

Do you know
what time it is?

Sorry, babe.

It was nice, you and me.

Can I call you later?

Give me your number.

I'll call you.

Okay.

[Kevin drew's safety bricks]

*

Almost ready?

* you can never really
start from the start *

* the ending begins
inside of the heart *

* the people, they love
to remember your name *

* it's a hospital bed
but it's all just the same *

[Indistinct voice speaking]

All right, now let's, uh,

Let's give a warm
new Mexico welcome

To writer
Davy, um, Mitchell.


Um, hi.

My name's Davy Mitchell,

And I'm gonna be reading, um,

From my collection
of short stories

Called things people do
to each other.

Um...

This is a story called
woman in red.

"Before I flip back
to begin at page one,

"I fished another tape
from the little pile

"And popped it in.

"'Shitty opera.'

"But it wasn't shitty at all.

It was beautiful."

"Then she called him...

"A liar.

You dirty liar."

Hi, Davy?

Hi.

Oh, hey.

Yeah.
I thought it was really great.

You were, tonight.

Thanks.

I'm, uh, I'm Josie.

I'm Davy.

Yeah, I know, dummy.

So, um,
I really like how you...

How you write about yourself.

I don't write about myself.

I know a lot of writers do.

They write about themselves,

But I write about other people,

Okay?

Yeah. Mm-hmm.

I'm sorry. I didn't...

I'm sorry.

I'm a writer.

I take my writing...

Maybe too seriously.

No, that's good.
That's...

And I had, like,
five beers anyway, so...

Oh.

So what is this whole thing?

Is this, like,
what you guys do for a living?

Oh, no, we're just, uh...

We're going around, I guess.

So you're just
two brothers in a car,

Armed with only your talents,

The dark, lonely,
and endless road

Stretched out in front of you?

No limits, no limitations,

Just whatever you want,

Whenever you want?

Yeah, it's just like that,

Only much less exciting.

How about your brother?

Um, he's, uh,
he's just along for the ride.

God.

Um, so, hey, what do you do?

What do you like?

I'm an English major.

Hey, me too.
I was an English major.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

It's kind of miserable, huh?

For me.

It's miserable for me.

Probably, it...

That's... that's okay.

Yeah.

[Cell phone ringing]

Hello?

Hi there.

Hell... hello?

Hello? Hello?

Nicole?

Hi.

How are you?

Good.

And horny.

You?

The same.

Mm-hmm.

Good luck.

Are you... are you there?

I'm here.

Good.

And didn't lose my number
or anything.

Well, look who's excited.

Yeah.

Where are you?

I'm, uh,
I'm in the alley of a bar.

Yeah?

Are you all alone?

Y-yeah.

Good.

I was hoping you would be.

Um, can you speak up?

I can't really
hear you that well.

Uh, I, um, I can't.

My boyfriend's next door.

Oh.

Um...

Don't worry.

He's not gonna hear us.

I got wet
just dialing your number.

Are you touching yourself?

I am now.

[Door opens,
indistinct chatter]

What about you?

Nicole, can you
give me your number?

I got to call you back.

You leaving a girl
out in the cold?

No.

No, it's nothing like...

And I'll call you right back.

I'll call you.

I call shotgun.
Sean.

Yeah, that's right.

I don't call shotgun,
'cause I'm driving.

Sean. Sean.
What's up, dude?

No.

I wasn't.

What are you doing?

I'm hopefully getting laid.


Your car's a piece of shit.

Oh, thank you.


Come on.

Yeah, no, I got the door.

[Cell phone rings]

Hello?

Hi.

Hi.

Davy?

Yeah?

I'm ready to fuck.

Okay.

[Both moaning]

Thanks for that, babe.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, my God.

Really soon.

Wait.
You're all about sex.

Can't we talk a little bit?

You know, like, cuddle?

Okay.

Um, what do you
want to talk about?

I don't care.

Anything.

What do you think
I look like?

Um...

I think you have long hair,

And it's strawberry blonde.

And you have brown eyes

And big, red lips.

Am I close?


No comment.

Well, what about me?

What do you think
I look like?

Uh...

Well, you're white.

Pale, maybe.

Uh-huh.

Short hair.

You could say that.

Blue eyes.

They're green.

But close to blue.

Tall.

You're handsome.

Very strong features.

And nice arms.

All that from my voice?

Well, am I right?

No comment.


So do you really
have a boyfriend?

We're not that serious.

Don't worry.

Well, it kind of feels
like we are.

You could hardly call him
my boyfriend, Davy.

We just fuck.

Well then why aren't you
with him right now

Rather than pretending
to be with me?

Because.

I like this better.

So, Davy,
why are you phone fucking me

In the middle of the night?

And partly?

Because
I like it better too.

I've been on the road
for the last couple months.

Oh.

Are you in a band?

Uh, no.

Not nearly as exciting.

It's, uh, a book tour.

I knew you were
an intellectual.

What does that mean?

It was just...

In your voice.

I feel like I can hardly

Consider myself
an intellectual.

Jerking off
in the back of a station wagon

In a parking lot
in new Mexico

Doesn't really qualify.

Well,
when you put it that way...

So how old are you?

I'm 28.

Me too.

Really?

Where do you work?

I'm a secretary

At a funeral home.

Wow.

That must be...

That sounds
like a good job.

It's really sad.

Actually,
I have to sort of

Disconnect myself
from it all

To even deal with it.

Yeah,
now that I think about it,

It could be depressing.

Yeah.

My mom, she, um,
she died last year.

We were really close.

Oh, I'm... I'm very
sorry to hear that.

It was hard.

I set the whole
funeral up at work.

It was just...

I should quit.

That's...
Really, I should.

I should just...

You know what?

I think you should.

Yeah.

You know...


I got to get going, though.

That night
that you called me?

Yeah?

How'd you know
I was gonna be there?

I mean,
what made you call me?

I didn't.

I just needed someone
to be with.

I called a random number,
and...

There you were.

Good night, Davy.

Good night, Nicole.

So, Josie,
did my brother tell you

About his girlfriend?

No.

That's for me.
I don't need that.

For you too.

There you go.

Okay, yeah.

I'll just...
See you later.

[Seatbelt clicks]

[Stereo playing softly]

You been acting
like such a fuckin' brat

Since the minute
that we hit the road.

I'm getting sick of it.

Oh,
you're getting sick of it?

What?

At least I have a girlfriend
to cheat on.

You just made a joke
of this whole thing.

You're just doing this,

To fuck girls.

What is so wrong
with that, dude?

Oh, I'm sorry!

I'm not gonna
fuck girls anymore.

You know what I'm gonna do?

And I'm gonna get me
a little cardigan,

And I'm gonna walk around

So that they'll think
I'm smart.

Then we can be
fuckin' twins, man!

How does that sound?

[Cell phone rings]

Hello?

Hey.

I missed you.

Let me call you back.

I'll call you.

I'll call you later.

Wait.

What?

I missed you too.

Good. Bye, Davy.

All right.

What?

Yeah.

Sure. Who's that?

"Some call it longing.

"I call it silence.

"That night, though,
on the phone,

"I heard my brother's voice

"Clear as a trumpet.

"'Hello?

"'Hello?

"'Anthony.

Hello?'"

Thank you.

[Scattered applause]

I think I'm gonna leave
new Mexico soon.

Why?

Nicole, are you okay?

You sound upset.

It's just me and my boyfriend.

We...


It's been happening
a lot lately.

Well,
I'm sorry to hear that.

We argue all the time

About the stupidest shit.

He's an ass.

You deserve better than that.

Thank you, Davy.

That means a lot.

Hey,
that's what I'm here for.

We should meet sometime.

Oh, i... i don't know.

Just to see each other.

Uh, maybe.

I just...

I think that, um...

But right now it's just...

There's something
so special about this,

And I just... i don't think

We should mess with it,
okay?

Hey.

Hold on a sec.

Okay.

Hey.

What you doing?

Nothing.

Just, uh, sitting by the pool.

Hmm.

Were you on the phone, or...?

What?

No, I'm just kind of sick
of being inside all the time.

Wanted to...


Get out here
and get some fresh air.

Can you get me
a couple beers?

Oh, yeah.

You know,
I have, uh, the game on,

And I got a cot for you

If you want
to just take it inside

And hang out.

Yeah, it's kind of
nice out tonight.

Probably sleep
in the wagon again.

Yeah.

Gotten used to it.

Hear that.

You sure?

Yeah.

Oh, Davy.

I want to make you come.

Oh, I'm really close.

Oh, my God.
Your pussy feels so wet.

Mm.
Oh, fuck me, Davy.

[Grizzly bear's
on a neck, on a spit]

Sean, stop.

Sean, stop.

Oh, my God.

Aah.

Emerge from the shit box.

Do you want anything?

Um, yeah, I'll take a water.

Is that all you want?

Do you want something to eat?

No, just water's cool.

So nothing to eat?

No beef jerky?

No, thank you.

Just a water.

[Cell phone rings]

What are you doing?

Restricted number?
Hello?

Davy?

Do you want
to leave a message?

Sean, hey...

She wants you.

She hung up.

Just out of curiosity,

Who is that?

Who is it?

It's a friend of mine.

You don't know her.

What are you doing?

What are you...
in gallup?

Yeah.
That's cool.

No, you don't know her.

So how'd you meet her?

I haven't actually
met her yet.

She could be anybody.

With 1,000 cats,

Sells shit over the phone
for a living

With a little earpiece thing.

You jerk off, like, every time
you talk to her, don't you?

It's not just sex.

We... we talk about things.

We talk about...

My God.

Are you hungry?

Not now.

I can't believe

Davy?

I wish you were here
with me right now.

Yeah.

It'd be so nice
if we could sleep

In the same bed together.

It would be.

Yes, I did.

I, um, told him about us.

You did?

Yeah.

I wanted him to know.

That's... that's nice.

Davy, um,
can I ask you something?

Yeah, of course.

What is it?

Why do you want
to know that?

'Cause I'm... I'm curious.

Why don't you tell me first?

This isn't a game.

Fine.

At the same time,

On the count of three.

No, I just want to know
more about you, Davy.

That's all.

Okay.

Okay.

Three... Two... One...

Three.
15.

Say something.

It's okay, d...

It's okay.

Does that include me?

No, I never...

I never thought of you as...

That's all right.

Davy, it's...

I feel like there is.


Do you want
to talk about it?

Relationships.

What about them?

Relationships,

They don't always work out
so well for me.

You don't have to be
that hard on yourself, Davy.

There's all these girls

That I really
want to be with...

But I just never
do anything about.

What do you mean,
exactly?

I don't know.

I guess...

I just can't live up

To what they want from me.

You know what?

I think it's a good thing.

It's sweet.

So many guys sleep around.

You're special that way.

Really?

Of course you are.

You're a good person,
Davy.

I'm lucky to have you.

You're the closest thing
to a girlfriend I've ever had.

Wish I could grow
a better beard.

You know, like dad's.

Mm.

Her name's Nicole.

Okay.

[Rock Plaza central's

Hey, I'm glad you came.

All right, man.

Don't forget
Sarah's party. Friday.

Okay.

Yeah.

7:00, right?

Yeah, not this Friday.
Next Friday.

And bring a gift.

All right?

Yeah.

Get out of here.


So, um, must be nice
to be home.

Yeah, it's kind of
lonely, though.

Be a lot less lonely

If I could call you
when I wanted to.

I... i can't, Davy.

He's been getting suspicious

Of all this time

I've been spending
with you on the phone.

Well, we could have a code,

Like, ring once
and then hang up.

Can't we just
fool around some, babe?

That's all I want right now.

It'll be nice
with you in your home,

Just all by yourself,
with me.

Just the two of us.

What are you wearing?

A blood pressure monitor.

Okay, here it is.

This is a pulse monitor,

A blood-pressure machine,

And a thermometer
all in one.

[Distant music,
people talking]

[Rings doorbell]

Davy!

Happy Birthday.

Oh, thank you.

You look so good.

Come on in.

Hey, Davy's here!

Hey!

Everybody, it's cake time!

Oh, no.

Don't sing
Happy Birthday to me, please.

I'm so sorry.
This looks lovely.

Okay, wait...

I made it for you.

Thank you so much.

Thank you all so much.

[Turns music up]
Whoo!

* you know me so easy

* oh oh

* you know me so hard

* oh oh

* your life is like museums

* oh oh

* my life you judge

* oh oh

* oh, baby, don't caress me

* oh oh

* sometimes
we're [Indistinct] *

Oh, Davy, dance with me.

Oh, no, that's okay.

Oh, please, please,
dance with me.

Yeah, I'm just
gonna get a beer.

Oh, no, come on.

I'm... I'm gonna get a beer.

Oh, okay.

They're in there.

Davy.

Samantha. Hi.

Davy. Davy the temp.

The one and only.

Yep.

That was a stupid
thing to say.

The one and only.

Who talks like that?

Don't worry about it.

So have you been here long?

Just for a few minutes.

It's been a while.

I know.

It's... it's great to see you.

So no dancing, huh?

Not really my thing.

Uh-huh. Most people
who say that just can't dance.

Not true.

They get in the way
of my moves.

That's not
terribly convincing.

Why aren't you dancing?

Um, because I prefer
peanut butter and a Martini.

Thank you.

No problem.

So how was the trip
with your brother?

Was it the kerouacian fantasy

That you both
hoped it would be?

Um, I'm gonna ask you
for a favor.

Of course.

Can you not
talk about the trip?

You want some?

No, thanks.

People use peanut butter
to train dogs not to bite.

You put it on your fingers,

And they learn
to lick and be gentle.

It's kind of like, um...

I'm sorry.
I have a tendency to talk...

No, you know,
I never had a dog.

My parents wouldn't let me.

And now my landlord
won't let me.

I guess it just
wasn't meant to be.


Um...

I don't know if you told me,

Or if I just forgot.

I don't think
we talked about it much.

So what's it like?

Oh, it's hard to say.

I write about people.

Things people do.

Things people do
to each other.

I sound like an asshole,
don't I?

A conscious asshole

Is hardly an asshole.

What does that mean?

I don't know.

Does it matter?

I write short stories.

Mostly about my family.

Do you write about yourself?

Mm, that's true.

Yeah. What?
What?

I...

You really should
try some of this.


Sorry.

Okay.

It's good, huh?

Mm-hmm.

How was the party?

It was okay.

Who is she?

She's a friend of Sarah's.

Is she one of your three?

Yeah.

Oh.

What happened with her?

It was just kind of like
a one-night stand, really.

What do you mean
by "kind of"?

I just feel like
I should tell you, i...

I asked her out on a date.

Are you there?

Are you touching yourself?

No.

I can change that.

I don't want to.

Oh, come on.

I'm trying to talk to you.

Davy...

Look, I'm really tired.

Can we, um...

Yeah.

Sure. Um...

If I shut off my phone,

Just call me tomorrow.

Okay.

Bye.

Look, I'm really sorry
about the last time.

Huh?

You know, the last time
I saw you, before my trip.

I'm sorry about that,
the, uh...

Oh, stop.
Don't even mention it.

Okay.

Why'd you go?

What?

On your trip.

Um, truth is is

It seemed exciting at first,
you know.

The two of us
out on the road,

Meeting people, traveling,

Living on peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

Yeah.

Do you regret going?

No.

[Cell phone rings]

Oh, I'm sorry.

Someone important?

Uh, no.

No, not at all.

Well, I read your book.

You did?

Yeah, Sarah gave it to me.

I really liked it.

Really?

Are you sure?

'Cause you don't have
to do that thing.

You know, like pretend i...

No, I don't do that.

I really enjoyed it.

It was insightful,
and, you know, easy to read.

I'm easy to read?

Yeah, I had you pegged

Before you walked
into that kitchen.

And what was that,
exactly?

So, what?

Are you gonna get back
to writing soon?

I think I'm...

Don't say that.

Well, it's...

I'm okay with it.

Really.

Well, you know what
I'm gonna say, don't you?

Don't give up?

Don't give up.

[Cell phone rings]

Hi.

Hey.

How was your date?

Well, it wasn't a date,
really.

Well, you didn't answer
when I called.

You seem weird about
this whole Samantha thing.

And it's not fair.

All along
you've had a boyfriend,

And now I feel guilty, and...

I'm starting to believe
there isn't even a boyfriend.

Why would I make someone up?

What's his name then?

Aaron.

I'm driving.

I'll call you back...

Call me back in, like,
ten minutes, okay?

[Phone clicks]

Hello?

[Keys jingling,
cell phone rings]

This is fucked up, Nicole.

This isn't right.

The girlfriend
I've never seen?

The girlfriend who won't
give me her phone number?

The girlfriend
I can't even prove exists?

That girlfriend?

This is silly, Davy.

If this is so silly, Nicole,

Then why don't you get
Aaron on the phone

So I can tell him
who you're fucking

Behind his back
every night.

Don't do this.

Do what?

I need more than this.

Stop, Davy.

And who I can be with.

Stop being...

Being...
What am I being, Nicole?

Being what?

So mean.

Mean?

You won't even give me
your phone number

For Christ sakes.

How would you feel?

If you don't want this,

Davy, I'm sorry.
I'm...

[Phone clatters]

[Distant phone rings]

[Cell phone rings loudly]

Hey, I thought
you weren't gonna call.

Look, I'm really sorry
about the way I acted. I...

Davy? Sorry?

Oh, Samantha. Hey.

I didn't recognize
your number.

It's okay.

It's my work number.
It doesn't show up.

Listen,
I'm having your brother

And Sarah over this weekend.

You should come.

Okay. Yeah.

I have my own thing
I want to do,

Which is solar panel
installation,

And I've been
saying this forever.

And I don't understand

It's not a bad idea.

It's not gonna catch on.

It is gonna do well.
It's the future.

Is awesome, but...

That was a great dinner.

It really was.

Totally getting a chubby.

It was fun.

I like it, but I'm, uh...

Not that experienced
at cooking.

We should do it sometime.

You could be my sous-chef.

That'd be fun.

Chop.

Hey, Sean and Sarah,

That was a wonderful dinner.

I felt so adult eating it.

You almost look like one.

It was great.

Thanks.

So...

So?

Okay, a game.

Let's play a game.

Two truths and a lie,
right?

Two truths and a... yeah.

No, let's...
Let's not play that.

Yes.

Yeah.

It'll be fun.

No, let's play, um...
Scattergories.

'Cause that's fun.

We're doing it. Sarah.

Should I?
All right. I will.

Um, all right.

Two truths and a lie.

One...

I'm very much in love
with my boyfriend.

Aw.


That's a lie.

Two...

Um, I've been to India once.

And, three,
I've made out with a girl.

I know this one.

That's not fair.
You're out this round.

Uh, two... two or three?

Two's the lie.

We go with two.

Really? You ready?

Yeah.

Nope.

I was India when I was seven.

Du-dum.

Is it nice there?

Really? You've never
kissed a girl? Really?

No.

Do we want to fix
this little problem right now?

No, I think we're fine.

Okay.

It's your turn.

How about I go last?

I'll go last.

No.
I'm gonna do you right now.

Nice.

Sick.
That's really sick.

Thank you.

Davy still has
his baby blanket.

And he calls it Shirley.

He likes embarrassing me.

Well, now we know.

Okay.

So we're gonna
get rid of that.

Ah, uh, ugh, okay.

I'm starting over.

One. Um...

You'll like this.

Davy's first word was,

And I quote,
"interesting."

Wait, that's, like,
four or five syllables.

I know.

It's four syllables.

Okay, okay.

Once in junior high school.

Sean.
Jesus. Sean.

A guy? Really?
No, it wasn't a real kiss.

It was a dare,
and he was my best friend.

Sean, you know.
You were there.

He was the one daring me.

Yes, it was a fake kiss.

It was a fake kiss.

It was just a prank.

Hey, you embarrassed me.

Are you happy?

Just let's play
a different game.

Well, no, I mean, one more.
One more.

Yeah, it's only fair.
You're doing great.

Number three.

Number three...

Yeah, royally.

All right, so I'm just gonna
give you guys the third truth.

Sorry, dude.

While we were
on our road trip,

Um, Davy had this,
like, really fucked up

Phone sex relationship

With this girl
that he never met

Named Nicole.

You're such a prick.

Oh, no, come on.
Don't be shy.

There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

It's okay.

No,
you've got me curious now.

It was...
It was a stupid thing.

Come on, Davy.

We don't have to...
Let's uh...

I don't... i don't want
to talk about it, okay?

It was stupid, and...

Thanks for that, Sean.

You know what?

It's my turn now.

I just did you.

No, I want to do you.

I just did you, Davy.

No, I'm gonna do you,

And I get three truths too.

So sit down, Sean.

All right,
now it's a game.

Let's do it.

Okay, let... let me think
here for a second.

Davy, make it good.
Get him.

Okay. Um...

Okay, first, um,
when we were kids,

We were sleeping over
at this friends of ours' house,

And Sean pissed in his sleep.

It gets worse.

And so we had
to call our parents

To come get us
in the middle of the night.

And he, um,
he pissed so much

That, uh, they couldn't even
clean the couch.

Our family just had to buy
a new one for 'em, so...

Oh.

Okay, number... number two.

The first thing
Sean ever jerked...

He masturbated to,

Was a breast cancer
self-exam pamphlet.

I'm not even gonna ask

That's pretty amazing.

It was really...

So wrong.

Yeah.

Number three, um,

When we were on our road trip,

One night, Sean, um...

Well, we were at this bar,
and, uh...

Well, it's not really
that embarrassing,

But it's the truth,
at least.

No, tell us.
Yeah, yeah.

We were at this bar,
and there...

We were talking
to a bunch of college kids,

And there was
this really drunk girl,

And we were drinking,
of course,

And, um, there...

Sean was so drunk
that he threw up all over,

And I had to carry him
out of the bar.

That's really disgusting,
Sean.

It wasn't really a good one.
I'm sorry.

Hey.

Uh, well, let's play, uh,

Let's play
scattergories or something.

I don't know.
That would be fun.

I'll... okay, I'll go quick.

Okay.

Uh, okay, one,

I...Have, um...

I said I would be quick.

Okay, one...


Um, I have been locked
in a public bathroom overnight.

Two,
I have had sex in public.

Three...

Three.

Three, there's someone
in this room

I'd very much
like to kiss again tonight.

All right.

Oh, hey, no!

No, stay away from me.

Save me.
Don't let him near me.

Yeah.

He's gonna get it tonight

When we go home.

I am totally insulted now.

Thank you very much.

That's it. I'm out.
I'm sure you're lovely.

Thank you guys for coming,
though.

A wonderful evening.

This was beautiful.

We'll talk.
Okay.

Oh, I'll walk you out.

Let's get
your jackets and stuff.

Bye, Sarah.

Sure you guys
don't want to do this?

Get out of here.
You're awful.

Okay.

It was stupid, really.

Well,
do you still talk to her?

Nah, we don't really
talk anymore.

We didn't really talk much
to begin with.

Sean likes to make a big deal
out of those things.

What about that bathroom story
you were starting to tell?

What happened?

Uh, it was at work.

Um, it was awful.

So what happened?

Um, they found me
the next morning,

And I was a frantic mess.

I think
that I convinced myself

That I was not gonna be found

Until I had starved to death,

And, I mean, looking back,

I don't even know why.

I just tricked myself
into being completely terrified

When there was nothing to be
scared of in the first place.

Did you have a panic attack?

Yeah, like, a very long,

12-hour panic attack.

So, did...


Sorry.

No, it's okay.

Okay.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

You don't look comfortable.

No, I'm fine.


Mm.

Sorry.

I... i have
to use the bathroom.

Okay.

Okay,
so where... where is that?

Bathroom?

It's, uh, down the hall,
to the left.

[Door closes]


What's going on?

Nothing.

I'm... I'm good.

What is it?

I'm just, uh, well,

I'm... I'm feeling...

I just feel tired.

Look, I can't do this.

I thought that I could,
you know,

After the first time,
I thought I could brush it off,

But I can't.

I'm sorry.

I think you should go.

I'm really sorry.

I just...

Wait, your coat.

Hey.

Sarah, hi.

Hi.

You okay?

Here, come in.

Just wanted
to bring this over.

It's lasagna.

Thanks.

This... this is great.

I'm sorry.

It's just you haven't

Oh.

I'm sorry.

I've been busy.

Um, take... take a seat.

Well, are you...
Are you working?

Uh, no.

It's kind of a slow season
for temps right now.

I meant
have you been writing?

Oh.

No.

Oh.

Um, sit down, or...

Thank you.

Um, I don't know.

What is it?

Uh, I mean, we haven't
seen you in a month.

We've missed you.

Nothing.

This is embarrassing.

No.

It's not.

And I'm not here
to embarrass you.

Hey, what is it?

Nothing.

Was it what happened
with Samantha?

Oh, God.


It... it wasn't Samantha.

Was it the phone girl?

Yeah.

She stopped calling.

For how long?

Like six weeks.

Oh, I'm sorry.

It's okay.

It was my fault.

Davy,

I don't want this
to sound mean, but...

This whole thing,

It's just a fantasy
that you've created.

I'm fine.

Right, well, I know you,

And you're not fine.

[Upbeat music]

*

[Woman crying]

Fuck you.

Jesus.

[Engine faltering]

[Horns honking]

[Cell phone rings]

Hello?

Davy. Hi.

Nicole, it's you.

Been a while.

I know.

I've, uh,
I've been thinking about you.

I know.

Um, yeah, I was...

I want to meet you.

Okay.

When?

Hi.

How can I help you?

I'm checking in.

I have a reservation.

Just for one night?

For now.

Okay.

[Cell phone rings]

Hi.

Hi.

How was your trip?

It was good.

It was really good.

Well, I'm glad
you got in safely.

Me too.
How are you doing?

You sound nervous.

I do?
Yeah.

No.
I'm not.

I'm not nervous at all.
I...

I made reservations
at this restaurant.

It's called gianni's.

Uh, Davy.

I could either
meet you, or, uh...

Davy, listen.
If...

Yeah?

I can't make it tonight.

What?

I'm sorry.

Something's come up.

Say something.

I don't understand.

I came here to see you.

That's the only reason
why I came here.

Could we meet tomorrow?

Would that be okay?

I leave tomorrow, Nicole.

Let's meet at 2:00.

That'll give us enough time.

There's this place
off the highway.

Um, it's called
fairweathers.

Okay.

Okay. I'll be there.

Bye.

Bye.

Hi.
Hi.

Table for one?

I'm supposed
to meet a friend.

I don't know
if she's here yet.

Oh, okay.

Well, it doesn't really look

Like there's anybody waiting,

But you're welcome
to take a look around.

Thank you.

I think I'm gonna
have a seat at the bar.

If, um, if anyone comes in
asking for Davy Mitchell...

Mm-hmm.

That's me.

Okay. Will do.

Thanks.

Nicole?

No, sorry.

John?

No.

Yeah.

Are you sure no one's
come in and asked for me?

No, no one's come in.

Davy?

Hi.

I'm Aaron.

It's nice
to finally meet you.

Is it okay if we, um...

Go and sit down?

Please?

Hi.

Hi.

Two?

Yeah.

Uh, do you mind if we
have, like, a corner booth?

No, of course.

Thank you.

How's this?

This is fine.
Thank you.

Your waitress should be
with you in a moment.

Thank you.

Thanks.

She was nice.

I'm sorry, Davy.

Yesterday, i...

I just thought
a nice place would...

It's...

It's not easy being here.

I just...

This is embarrassing.

D-do you mind if...?

Do you...?

I'm sorry, i...

I really...

Really, really am.

It's okay.

You can stop apologizing.

Hi, you two.

I'm Amanda.

Hi, Amanda.

Um, water.
Okay.

Glass of water.
Thank you.

And you?

I'll have that
right up for you.

Could you bring two?

Sure.

That bad, huh?

So, uh...

Am I the first one
you talked to?

As Nicole?

Why do you do this?

I don't know.

I was 13.

The first time.

And there was this guy.

I was just
starting high school.

And I had a crush on him.

He was the first...

First guy
that I actually felt...

Something for.

I mean, it was...

All new and exciting to me,

And I just...

I... i couldn't
do anything about it.

Are y'all ready to order?

I'm good with drinks for now.

Okay.
Thank you.

Thank you.

Do you mind if i...?

Oh, no.

Thank you.

S-so...

I called him one night.

Jesse.

And I, um,
put on a girl voice,

And pretended I was one

Of the cheerleaders
from school,

Nicole.

And it worked.

He actually talked to me.

Thinking I was her.

So you just kept it going?

I just
got into the habit of it.

And i... eventually,

I just got really good
at the voice.

That's for sure.

How long do they last?

Well, um...

Sometimes it's just one call.

Um, other times
it's a few days, a few months.

One guy lasted a few years.

Sometimes it's...

Just sex.

Sometimes it's...

It's more.

Either way,
they mostly ended up

Flaring out at the end.

So I ended up, um,

Keeping, like, a couple
of guys going at once.

You mean you've been
cheating on me this whole time?


No.

So how do you keep them going?

Why do they keep
taking your calls?

Why did you?

Boredom, mostly.

Oh.

So you come here a lot?

Hardly ever.

Is this
where you meet... Guys?

Nicole guys?

Yeah, but not many.

I mean, what's happened?

Well,
there was, um, one guy,

He got really,
really angry with me,

Outside in the parking lot,

So, um, I got scared,

So I came in and I waited.

And eventually he came in
and he sat down with me.

And what happened after that?

Uh...

We went to his, um,

Motel room, and...

We had sex.

What?

I just... i can't...

I mean,
talking to Nicole, she's...

You.

Her, i...

Was the most sexual person
that I've ever known.

But you're so shy.

I don't understand it.

I've done a lot of things
I'm not proud of.

Like?

No.

I'm not gonna...

No, come on, Aaron.

Aaron, you can't do that.

Just tell me one.

Okay.


One guy, um...

Fucked his wife
while I listened.

She didn't know.

I don't...

I don't know why I did it.

I... i think 'cause I thought
it was gonna be...

Exciting?

And he wanted to leave
his wife for Nicole,

And I just decided
to stop calling him, so...

When was that?

That was, like,

Four years ago.

Around the same time
my mom died.

I thought your mom
died last year.

Yeah, I lie about that.

I really like talking
about her with people,

But I think
they would think I was weird

If they find out
it was four years ago

And I still
can't get over it.

Do you really work
in a funeral home?

Unfortunately,
that's true.

You see that woman
over there?

The blonde one?

Mm-hmm.

She was stood up.

That's so sad.

When she first came in,

I thought she was you.

I'm sure that
would have been a relief.

Yeah.

What did you...

You know, think of

When you saw her?

I thought we'd be back
in my hotel room by now.

Yeah.

What?

I don't understand
why you do this.

I mean,
you're a handsome guy.

I would think
you would have no trouble

Finding a guy to be with.

Thing is, I'd like
to be in a relationship.

It's just...

It's just really hard...

To find something,

Something so serious.

I mean,
living here where I do,

It's...

I just really don't fit in.

Maybe I'm looking
in the wrong places.

You know,
at bars and at clubs.

You know,
that whole thing.

But people
just don't seem to get it,

That... that politeness

That there is between
a man and a woman,

You know,
the time right before

They actually sleep together?

Like if you see a girl,

You know right away
if you're gonna,

You know, fuck her or not.

But that doesn't mean
you're going to.

I mean,
you take her to dinner,

Maybe a couple of times.

To a movie.

But no one...

That's why
it's so much better

With me on the phone.

It just works.

Earlier when I said

I kept taking your calls

'Cause I was bored?

Yeah.

I was lying.

I like talking...

To Nicole.

It's... it's okay.

I have to use the bathroom.

I'll be right back.


Aaron.

* I have told

* myself I know

* a thousand ways

* to leave this place
