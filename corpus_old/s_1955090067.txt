Ray.

Ray.

Ray, Ray, Ray...

Home's the other way.

Remember?

I gotta go!

Go ahead, DeeDee.

I gotta go!

I said, go ahead, DeeDee!

Kent?

You awake?

Kent?

Good morning.

Here, take two of these.

There you go.

Here.

What? No more vikes?

Kent, you gotta take your
meds when you're supposed

to or you're gonna
run out of them.

I mean it.

Here.

This rash doesn't look so good.

Hey!

I'm done!

Hey, Todd. Todd!

I'm moving it in a sec.
Don't worry about it.

Todd, wait.

She's screaming
a lot today.

I'll see what I can do.

Now I don't wanna
have to do it.

But if she doesn't stop,
I'm going to call the police.

Lucky for you, here I am.

Ha! That says reserves.

You're not a real cop.

Real enough to arrest
you for trespassing.

Now get off our property.

Get off our property.

Parks his damn bus in
my driveway every day.

How's the aquarium coming?

Leaks, spills.

You gotta take everything
into consideration.

Yes, sir.

Complex.

What's complex about it?

Nothing, I was just...

It just seems like you're
doing a ton of work on it.

Got your laundry, Todd.

Thanks, ma.

Yeah, another one of these
Gulf War veterans died and

they don't know why.

Cause unknown.

Let me see that.

She's getting into
the walls again.

Cause unknown,
my Irish ass.

What the hell is she doing
inside those walls anyway,

for Christ's sakes?

Who's in the walls?

Your sister.

There's nothing
in these walls.

No insulation.

Things rattle
around, maybe a mouse.

How your parents bought a
house with no insulation,

I'll never understand.

You gonna...

Give me the phone.

Yeah, hello.

Well how do you
know that for sure?

Right.

Okay.

Alright. Bye.

Willy Crum is fooling
with DeeDee again.

I heard it on the news
so it must be true.

Yeah, big joke.

Fooling?

What do you mean fooling?

It's nothing.

Settle down.

That was the box factory.

They're tired of it.

Who the hell are
the box factory?

Who the hell are they?

What's he doing?

Nothing, it's nothing.

Now stop it.

I'm gonna slap him.

No, you're not.

He's retarded
for god's sakes.

I don't care that
he's retarded.

Willy Crum. Willy coming?

Hey, sweetie, look at you.

You got dressed.

Good girl.

Where Willy?

-Sweetheart.
-Let me get you some breakfast.

Sweetheart, you gotta
stay out of the walls.

I'm not. Where Willy?

Come and sit down.

DeeDee, is that guy
messing with you?

I'm not.

Bathroom!

-Bathroom!
-Just sit down.

Sweetie.

No bathroom now.

Bathroom.

-No bathroom now.
-Bathroom.

-DeeDee...
-No, bathroom.

Alright, alright.

-Take it easy. Take it easy.
-Leave her alone.

DeeDee. DeeDee.
Ed, leave her alone!

DeeDee, don't.

I'm going to the bathroom.

Now that's enough.
That's enough!

No, bathroom!

I am warning you!

-Going to bathroom.
-Now stop it!

Ed, do you remember what
happened the last time you

tried to stop her?

Bathroom!

DeeDee.

-I got it.
-Okay.

Alright, that's good.

-You got it?
-Yeah.

Would someone
come up here?

Are you okay, Kent?

Hey, hey.

Hey, you alright?

I've been better.

Pain.

No, I got it.

Just help me...

Get around the base.

I've been killing
it on reserves.

I was out with these
two cops last night.

I made three arrests.

I almost took out my
gun, but I didn't.

I wish you'd seen it.

Mind if I smoke?

No.

DeeDee's acting up again.

Insane.

She...

She knocked dad
right on his ass.

Aw, I wish I
could've seen that.

He went down
like a ton of bricks.

Smashed together.

Nope, no, no, nope.

I got it. I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

Okay.

Check it out.

What?

What is it?

You remember?

You shut 'em out
and had four hits.

You were great.

That was the night everybody
said you were going to the show.

Todd.

Todd.

Can I have the cigarette?

Yes, here.

Man.

You should do
something with this.

I'll see you in a little
while, champ, alright?

I'm not really gonna
call the cops, Todd.

But hey, we're
old, you know?

Yeah, I know,
Mrs. Salisbury.

I'm sorry, too.

Merry Christmas.

Hey, Willy!

If I thought you were
messing with my sister,

I'd wipe the
streets with you.

Ed, Willy's at the door.

Can you let him in?

Alright,
come on in, Willy.

Stop right there, son.

Stop right there.

Don't go running through
the house, Willy.

DeeDee.

Willy.

Stop right there, son.

Willy, you can't
touch DeeDee anymore.

But there's cookies.

Have a cookie, Willy.

It isn't right.

There's apples?

Alright, have
an apple, Willy.

Willy, did you understand
what I just said?

Don't eat the core.

Willy...

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

Okay, alright.

Cut it out.

Alright, come on.

Let's go.
The van is waiting.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

Come on. Come on.

Okay, let's load up, folks.

Not one.

Alright, Crum, no snacks
if that continues.

Willy, come on.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

Bye, mommy.

Bye, sweetie.

Bye!

Just one.

Just one.

Not one.

Alright, come on.

Everybody back to work.

Let's go, come on.

What's going on in here?

Hey!

How's your brother doing?

Good.

Great.

Better.

I never see him.

He doesn't get out much.

That's too bad.

The hell of a ball player.

Absolutely.

He was the best.

Should've gone pro.

Went to Iraq instead.

Well, can't play for the
Yankees, might as well go

play for Uncle Sam.

How come you never played?

I did.

Yeah!

What...

What can I get you?

I'll have a
glass of red wine.

Red wine.

And an application.

I'm looking for a job.

Well, I wish I
could help you.

What's your name, honey?

Jessie.

Why don't you
put your...

your number down, Jessie?

You know, if I hear of anything,
I'll let you know.

Drink's on the house.

Hey, thanks.

-She's new in town.
-Mhm.

She's got no wedding ring.

You want me to
introduce you?

No.

No, no, never
been good at that.

Thank you for calling
the Veteran Affairs

claim assistance hotline.

If you're calling to
request a copy of a

document relating to your
VA record, please submit

the signed, written statement to
your local regional office.

If you would like to speak...

Lift 'em.

Going to dance?

Yeah, honey.

Going to Christmas dance?

Yes, I said yes.
Lift your arm.

Christmas dance at the
box factory, I'm going?

Yes, I said yes.

You're going to the Christmas
dance at the box factory.

Lift this arm.

I am, jerk.

Willy, too?

I don't know, honey.
Stop moving. Stop moving.

I love him.

Willy Crum, he's
the one I love.

Keep... keep your arm up,
just another...

I am. I hate you!

There is no reason to
act this way, okay?

No one is hurting you.

Now stop playing
with the water.

I'm not, alright!

DeeDee, I am warning you,
stop hitting the water!

You're like a jerk!

I want Willy.

License and registration, ma'am.

Get in bed and turn over.

DeeDee.

Did Willy Crum put his
fingers in you again?

No, sir.

Finger.

DeeDee.

If he does that, or if he
tries to do that again,

don't let him and
tell Mr. Jenkins.

I love him, you know.

Jesus Christ.

John F. Kennedy.

Not tonight.

John F. Kennedy!

Mowing Jesus' lawn.

His brother, Bobby.

Mowing Jesus' lawn.

Pope Paul.

The lawn.

Pope Pious.

The lawn.

Pope John.

The lawn.

Pancake, the cat
the car smashed.

The lawn.

They're all mowing
Jesus' lawn.

Jesus loves them.

Yeah, honey.

Cause they do the lawn.

Yeah, let's get to sleep
before Jesus looks down

for some new helpers.

He won't, will he?

Not if we move along.

Willy Crum, he
loves me you know.

I know.

I know.

Everybody knows.

They're sending a bunch of
weapons inspectors back to Iraq.

I wish I was going.

Bet your butt I'd come
back with a good war story.

There's no such thing.

What about dad's?

We're enjoying
ourselves...

I don't need to
hear that again.

Hear what again?

We were just trying to
remember your war story.

Todd.

Nothing to remember.

What are you
talking about?

We were enjoying
ourselves on the beach.

Come on, dad.
You tell it.

No.

We'd only been in
country a few weeks.

We hadn't seen
any action yet.

I'm taking the entry exam for
the police force next week.

Again?

I'm gonna ace
it this time.

Did you get smarter or
did the test get dumber?

Todd, let your dad eat.

No, I gotta good feeling.

I'm doing really
good on my patrols.

The reserves.

You gotta do the volunteer
stuff if you wanna get

into the academy.

I do all the same things.

I assist on arrests.

I carry a gun.

No pay though.

That day is not far off.

The cops don't
want you, Todd.

The military turned
you down, too.

You're just not that
kind of material.

Face it.

I love you, ma.

-Love you, too.
-Yeah.

Real nice, Ed.

He's not being realistic.

The situation
with Willy Crum,

we have tried
everything to stop it.

They're in love.

Love to a...

Retarded person.

It's still love.

Mentally
challenged adults.

When my daughter was
born, it was retarded.

I'll stick with
that, thanks.

My retarded daughter
has feelings.

Of course.

I don't trust you agreeing
with me so you can stop it.

Every time an alarm
goes off, he goes off.

He does it for DeeDee.

He does it because he
can't help himself.

You can't blame
DeeDee for that.

You see how
disruptive it is.

Yeah, not so good for
the box business?

What do you pay
these people?

Twenty bucks a week?

I resent that.

Mrs. Kendall, we're providing
a community service here.

Yeah, but you have to
allow for their behaviors.

DeeDee placed this in a
box on its way down the

assembly line.

For Willy.

It's a used maxi pad.

I can see that.

It's a gift.

It's how she shows
her feelings.

It's not sanitary.

Don't tell me that my
daughter isn't sanitary.

I keep that girl clean.

We're not saying you don't
take good care of DeeDee,

Mrs. Kendall.

What if I keep her
home a few days?

Mrs. Kendall...

DeeDee cannot come back
to the box factory.

This will explain
everything.

Sweetheart,
we're just gonna go home.

-No, I wanna go Willy.
-We're gonna go home.

You didn't do
anything wrong, okay?

-No.
-Come on, don't fight me, baby.

I don't wanna go.

Willy!

Please, please, don't
give me trouble.

-I wanna stay here, mommy.
-Okay?

No, no, no. I know!

I don't wanna go!

I wanna stay with Willy!

Honey, stop.
Stop it.

-Mommy, no! I'm not gonna go!
-Calm down.

Honey.

-No!
-Stop.

-No!
-Stop!

-No.
-Stop it!

Stop! Sweetheart, let go.

No!

Stop!

DeeDee, no!

DeeDee!

DeeDee!

DeeDee!

DeeDee!

They used to bring them in
and hook 'em up for you.

I'll take a
Jack and ginger.

Hold the Jack.

Good for you.

Good for me.

Nice to see your
face in here again.

You, too.

Yeah.

Kent's stuff's over there.

Your other boy comes
in here sometimes.

I wouldn't know.

There they are.

Alright. There you go, Ray.

Look at these two
peas, Mark, Jamie.

Alright.

Can I come in?

Thanks, sorry.

Does this bus go all
the way to Tottenville?

No, that's
actually the 59.

It's a much larger bus.

You know what, I
need to get off.

I'm so sorry.

No, no, no.

Don't worry.

I'll take you.

Are you sure?

Happy to do it.

You...

New in town?

It's that obvious?

Well...

I don't mean anything
by it, it's just

it's kind of a
forgotten place.

That's what I'm
looking for.

What's your name?

I'm Jessie.

Hi...

I'm...

Shit!

Un-fucking-believable.

No, no, no, I have this.

-Get out of here, man.
-I have this.

What is this?

-It's a silver star.
-It's a silver star?

What the fuck am I gonna
do with a silver star?

No, it's silver. It's
gotta be worth something.

What the fuck
are you doing?

What the fuck
are you doing?

That's your fucking
silver star.

I don't care, it
doesn't mean anything!

Get on the bus.

No, stop it's my...

No, no, no!

I need something.

I need something.

I know, I know, I know.

Get on the bus.

Get on the bus.

Stay on the bus.

Ray, please no singing
right now, Ray.

Please.

I know, I know, I know.

Just get in the seat.

Just get in the seat.

Just stay in the seat.

Fine! Okay, okay, okay!

Quiet!

Fucking quiet!

Can you let me off please?

It's all alright.

Everybody's alright.

Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

I don't wanna go
in there and die!

I don't wanna go in there!

Yeah.

Alright.

-Alright.
-Alright?

Come on.

What are you looking at?

Go inside.

-Okay, I know.
-Honey, come on.

What are you looking at?

I'ma go inside.

Okay.

No need to tell
your father.

Great.

Don't waste your
time reading that.

We have to consider
institutionalizing her.

No.

It's bad enough with Kent
pulling his act upstairs

all these years.

It's not an
act, he's sick.

He came back from
the war sick.

How is it you don't
understand that?

Okay.

What is that?

What was what?

She's in the
walls, I tell ya.

She's tied to a bed
for Christ sakes.

Look, Elaine...

It's not just that she can't
go back to the box factory.

It's the whole program.

Medication is part
of that program.

We can't afford
her medication.

She's gonna go
off her meds.

Don't you remember what
happened the last time?

It took five of them
and a strait jacket.

Jesus, they had to shoot
her with a tranquilizer

gun like a damn animal!

I'll find a way
to make it work.

I'll get her in
another program.

She's been in three programs
in the last two years.

Remember how much fun we
all used to have when the

kids were little?

We'd eat dinner together for
Christmas, go to the dance.

We were good dancers, Ed.

Everybody said.

And Kent was
everybody's favorite.

Girls couldn't
get enough of him.

They knew he was a caring
boy, a loving boy.

In his Marine blues.

They swooned.

They fell like spent
flower petals at his feet.

That was fun.

Will we ever do
that again, Ed?

Yeah, Kendall.

K-E-N-D-A-L-L.

The doctor knows me.

I don't care.

My kid needs help.

He has to talk to me.

Go and get him.

Hold on, baby.

Hold on. I can't...

Doctor Mooney, it's
Elaine Kendall.

Yeah, it's about Kent.

He's run out of his meds.

No, I know it's six days
until his next prescription.

No, I don't care
about the law.

You have to help us!

Hello?

Hello?

Motherfucker!

Alright, baby.

Come on, we're
gonna go out.

Come on.

Come on. Sit up.

Come on, we're gonna go
someplace and get some meds.

Come on.

Thank you.

It's gonna be Christmas
this Saturday, DeeDee.

You know what that means?

Willy Crum put
his finger in me.

You tell him not to.

Big fish are gonna be
swimming in this tank soon.

That's Christmas.

That's the day
God's son was born.

Fish?

Fish, yeah.

You know, DeeDee, enough
piranha can shred a full

sized horse down to the
bone in under a minute.

Yup.

And those horses that are
getting eaten up after a

while they don't care
because they go into shock.

Shock.

Shock is when you hurt so
bad that you don't feel

anything anymore.

It's a gift from Jesus.

John F. Kennedy.

Sug.

Not now, honey, not...

John F. Kennedy.

Okay.

Mowing Jesus' lawn.

Joe DiMaggio.

The lawn.

Sid, the dog that
ate the rat poison.

Doing the lawn, baby.

They're all
doing the lawn.

Jesus loves them.

Well, he tolerates
their money.

Mommy's here.

Okay.

Slow down.

It's all okay now.

Mommy's home.

Mommy's here.

Hey, kid.

Hey, pop.

They gave him a shot of
Demerol at the hospital.

Great.

Yeah, that was the nicest
people in the whole world.

We'll go back there.

That was a keeper.

Gave me enough meds til
next week, then I'll get

his refill.

Even better.

Because I was still...
That I was sick.

You know?

No fooling.

They knew their business.

They just...

Psychosomatics.

Psycho psychotics.

Psycho traumatic.

Gobbley, whoop-di-do!

Just to peel our shit,
right to the vein.

You!

Okay, okay, take
it easy, Kent.

Go easy.

Woo!

I forgot all these years.

What?

Just how pretty
your eyes are.

I knew it.

You're married.

All the good ones are.

I'm sure that he
does not deserve you.

Okay.

Okay, let's go, bud.

Okay, kid, let's go.

Upstairs.

Look at that, daddy-o.

Look at that.

That was the Christmas
spirit in that hospital.

Let's go upstairs.

Okay.

I'm going.

-Alright.
-Okay.

Tell me your war story.

No, no, no.

Not now.

We were enjoying
ourselves.

Yup, on the beach.

Okay.

That's all now.

Come on, champ.

Let's call it a night.

You must hate me.

I don't hate you.

You don't come
up here no more.

I'm here now, Kent.

But you don't no more.

We were enjoying
ourselves on the beach,

it was getting dark.

We'd been in
country a few weeks.

But we hadn't seen
any action yet.

We just finished building an air
strip so we were celebrating.

Drinking beers, smoking,
goofing around, you know.

And hey, it was.

And after a while, everybody
went back to the camp.

Except you.

Except me.

I stayed down
on the beach.

I wanted to look
at the stars.

That's when I saw them.

They came out of the west.

Four Chinese minks.

They came in tandem, two
by two, and they dropped a

shit load of bombs on us.

Resulting in heavy
shrapnel dispersal.

That's right.

Heavy shrapnel dispersal.

See?

You know the rest
of the story.

No, come on.

Come on, there were
bombs everywhere.

The bombs were everywhere.

And I ran back to the camp
and they were all dead.

All of them.

Dead in their hammocks.

Shredded.

They were wrapped in them.

Wrapped in their blood-drenched,
charred hammocks

like sausages in
their casings.

I was the only
one left alive.

I was the only
one left alive.

I wonder why you never
got a medal for that.

Fuck!

Here you go.

You ever seen one
of these before?

Yeah, sure.

That's a silver star.

They give it to
you for bravery.

And they forget
all about you.

How you doing?

Todd!

No, no, no!

I didn't do anything, man!

I'm not gonna hit you.

I just wanna talk.

You holding?

Alright.

Yeah.

Just take all of it.

Yeah, man.

Merry Christmas.

Alright.

You may visit on the
weekends, but we do ask

for twenty-four
hours notice.

What if we wanna bring her
home for a couple of days?

Well, not in the
first six months.

Routine is very
important, Mr. Kendall.

They have to get used to
the idea that this is now

their home.

What about at night?
Where do they sleep?

Most sleep two,
three to a room.

They get used to it.

I dropped my picture.

I'm not supposed
to leave the car.

Aw!

Sure, I'll get it for you.

Here you go.

I'm not finished yet.

Do you like rabbits?

Sure, I do.

You can have this one.

Wow.

Are you all by
yourself our here?

Yeah.

You are?

Hey, excuse me.

Can I help you?

Yeah, I was trying to
help the little girl.

He asked me if
I was by myself.

Come on, Annie.

Let's go.

Come on. You're coming
with me, let's go.

Wait, this is a
misunderstanding.

Okay.

I'll send someone else
out to take your order.

Come on. Watch your step.

I said, don't talk to
strangers, right?

Hey.

Hey.

Todd.

I got you something.

Are those oxy's?

Thank you, Todd.

Thank you.

Just don't pull that shit
like you did on my bus again.

Mhm.

I don't want people
seeing you act that way.

I'm sorry.

I get so cramped up here.

I get so fucking
swallowed up here.

Then I run out of meds.

I get suffocated.

Go easy on those.

Alright, they gotta last
you to your next refill?

Who's your decorator, bro?

How come you never
hear nothing on all

these claims you got
against the Marines?

Because they got an
answer for every problem.

The rash, your problem.

The long's your problem.

No, it can't be linked to
anything specific.

Yeah, no, no, it's not the
inoculations for anthrax

and the others.

No, it's not the
radioactive shells.

That wouldn't cause the pain
that you're describing.

We recommend psychiatric
counseling.

It's standard.

It's standard.

Don't worry, here's
another form.

Yeah, but I hear some people
get their claims approved.

They wear you out
and hope you die.

They're gonna
win this one.

Don't say that shit, man.

I hate when you do that.

You're lucky I don't have
something more contagious.

Some guys, they come back
so radioactive that they

affect their
entire family.

Glory to the pats.
Some war memorabilia.

Give me that.

Give me it.

What is this?

It's just a picture.
Give it to me.

No kidding.

What are you
doing with it?

Give it to me.

Okay.

We, were following the
action after we liberated

Kuwait.

Just a young guy
looking to live.

You must have helped
him out a lot.

Yeah.

We all helped him.

We killed his
family by mistake.

However it happened,
they died.

I know.

I get it.

Get some rest.

I woke up...

I woke up and I did
know what was happening.

I did know.

He was on top of me.

What are you
talking about?

His mouth...

on my cock.

I really didn't
have to do anything.

So I just went with it.

Go to sleep, Kent.

Stop talking
and go to sleep.

I just needed you
to know something.

Go to fucking sleep, Kent.

My company command
that walked in...

Go to fucking sleep, Kent!

They did it!

They drove me out of the Marines
for that night with Izzy.

No, no, no!

No, because
it's a mistake.

My job, the bus, the
reserves, if they ever

find out I got some fucking
loser junkie for a brother.

No, I need 'em
for the pain, man!

I just need 'em
for the pain!

It's for the pain, Todd!

Alright.

Dee, take these cigarettes
up and put 'em on Kent's

night table.

No.

He'll be looking for
'em when he wakes up.

Then get ready for bed.

No.

Don't give me any guff.

What'd you do to your thumb?

It's nothing.

I went to Sunrise,
Staten Island today.

Had a look around.

Without telling me?

There's a chance they
might take DeeDee.

You went there
without telling me?

They got a really nice
bed there for her, honey.

Sunrise is no
place for DeeDee.

The people there are
much worse than DeeDee.

She's better off
dead than there.

So what do you wanna do?

You wanna keep her here
with us and then she flips

out and the cops come and
then health and human

services come and they
haul her off to some

dumping ground that's
worse than Sunrise.

Atleast Sunrise is clean.

You should've told me
about Sunrise, Ed.

You should've told me that!

I'm coming up DeeDee.

Okay, DeeDee, sleep.

I am, jerk.

I hate you.

I know, baby.

Think you're big.

Yup.

Settle down now.

Mommy, out. I don't wanna!

Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ.

John F. Kennedy.

Mowing Jesus' lawn.

His brother, Bobby.

Mowing Jesus' lawn.

The parakeet I ate.

By mistake.

Yeah.

Mowing Jesus' lawn.

The pope.

The lawn.

The other pope.

That big lawn, baby.

Kent's in his bedroom.

What did you say?

Kent's in bed.

He's mowing Jesus' lawn.

I'd like to do it.

Just a little longer.

Why didn't they
shoot for Kent?

They're not gonna
do that, Elaine.

Why not?

He was...

He didn't qualify.

He's a veteran.

He fought for his country.

They owe him that!

-Mom, don't...
-Elaine.

Elaine.

Elaine.

Stop it.
Stop it.

-Let go of me.
-We have to stop.

-Let go of me.
-Elaine!

Stop!

Stop!

I want you to go over there
and shoot for my son.

He's a veteran.

He's just like you.

He's a marine.

If you knew my son,
you'd shoot for him.

Please, sir, your wife.

Please?
Please?

Please.

Please?

Please?

Bastard.

Heartless bastard.

Look what you're doing.

Get DeeDee and go home.

Okay.

Listen to your mother.

Ma'am.

Ma'am.

I'll shoot off a few rounds
for your boy if you want.

Yeah?

Thanks.

Could you shoot seven?

Heck, ma'am, I'll shoot all
twenty-one if you can stand it.

I can stand it.

What are you doing?

I'm gonna go to bed now.

Ed, you can sleep in
the bedroom any...

anytime you want.

I, I'm in no
shape for that.

Snoring and everything, I...

I don't mind.
Not so much.

I know. I don't
think I-I can.

Maybe just tonight.

I can't, honey.

What am I gonna do now?

I'm gonna make
you some tea.

Jesus Christ.

Willy.

My god, DeeDee!

Dee!

DeeDee!

Willy!

Hold up! Hold up!

Willy!

Willy!

Willy!

Willy!

Willy!

Willy!

Willy.

Willy.

Willy.

Willy.

Okay?

Yeah.

She'll be alright.

Sh!

Did you hear that?

Hear what?

I didn't hear anything.

There it is again.

I heard it.

Me too.

Sh! Sh! Sh!

What the fuck?

No, don't, don't.

I knew it.

Just one.

-Willy.
-Just one.

Get out of the wall and come
into the house the right way.

I am not letting that
maniac into this house.

DeeDee here?

DeeDee coming?

I need to talk to you.

Keep an eye on him.

I got him.

Have you seen enough?

Did this do it for you?

This is why we have to
put her away, Elaine.

Yeah, sure, right.

Put 'em all away.

Put every little different
thing out of sight.

Like you did
with your son.

I'm going out.

He was dying up there, Ed.

The least you could've
done was watch.

I watched.

How could you miss it?

Any of it?

What are you gonna do?

I really wish
you'd said we.

What are we gonna do?

Go get, DeeDee, would you?

I gotta take Willy back to
the assisted living center

and he won't come with
me without your sister.

Want me to come?

No.

Make sure your
father gets home.

I will.

Nobody should ever
lose their boy.

Merry Christmas, guys.

How's it going tonight?

Willy, what do you want?

Hamburger? Hotdog?

Yes.

We'll have...

Just give him a minute.

Okay.

Willy.

Willy, honey.

Willy.

That's just his thing.

You like to dance?

Me too.

Hey, speaking of which we
are supposed to give these out.

Willy won't make
it this year.

I wish I could
sleep like that.

Yeah.

So we'll have...

Two hamburgers,
two hot dogs...

A large fry, a coke,
and a coffee for me.

Thanks.

Coffee.

Great, I will put that in
and I can come right back

with the coffee.

I've never seen
you run before.

Hell of a day?

Willy.

Willy.

DeeDee needs
love and care.

Do you understand?

Just one.

No, no, no, honey!

Honey.

Let her sleep.

Because I'm thinking of letting
you spend more time with her.

DeeDee?

Yeah.

DeeDee.

Remember the night
he got that trophy?

Yeah.

Empire State awards.

Every scout from
the east was there.

Joe DiMaggio stopped
by our table.

He said Kent had the best
swing on him that he'd

seen in any kid from New
York in twenty years.

He meant it, too.

Joltin' Joe DiMaggio.

The Yankee clipper.

They'll never be
another Joe DiMaggio.

If we let you be
around DeeDee,

you have to believe
in her special-ness.

You understand?

Part of that is having
respect for DeeDee.

And that means not putting
your fingers in her.

You understand?

But you have to
have respect.

Respect.

Respect, Willy, yeah.

You have to respect
for anything to work.

DeeDee.

Yeah.

Yeah.

DeeDee.

I think I may
have killed him.

What?

I gave him some pills.

I didn't know he got
booted up at the hospital

and I gave him some oxy.

A lot of it.

Jesus Christ.

I said some awful
things to him.

I got in an argument and I
said some not nice stuff

that I shouldn't.

You didn't kill him, Todd.

He took care of
that on his own.

You know what happened
with Kent in the Marines?

He got injured.

Yeah, but...

He got sick.

Something got him sick.

The VA they're not
telling me anything.

Tell you what?

Why he didn't get a
military funeral.

It don't make sense.

Everybody gets one.

Let it go, dad.

Todd.

If you know anything,
please tell me.

He got kicked
out of the core.

For what?

I don't know.

Well how do you know
he got drummed out?

Because he told me.

Told you what?

That he got dishonorably
discharged.

Damn liar!

He's a decorated veteran.

Okay.

A bona fide hero.

You can stop being
jealous of him.

He's dead!

Stop, dad.

Stop.

Just stop.

You knew nothing
about, Kent.

You didn't know a god
damn thing about him.

You and your
fucking war stories.

You put that
shit in his head.

You wanna know why your son
got kicked out of the core?

You wanna know?

Answer me!

You don't wanna know.

You don't.

I never got a medal for
the Denang air raid.

I know the story.

No, you don't.

I wasn't on the beach.

I was on a nearby hill
attending radar and I was

on the only one on duty and I
got shit faced and conked out.

And the migs made it
through the radar and

massacred my company.

The only medal that I got
was the combat medal.

It means that you killed some
other poor son of a bitch.

It's not a flashy
medal, it's humble.

And it should be because
there's nothing more

humbling than killing.

Where is everybody?

Picking up Willy Crum.

For what?

Christmas dinner.

I couldn't talk your
mother out of it.

You gotta be kidding me.

No, it's what she wants.

What happened
to the piranhas?

Turns out, they're
illegal to own.

Who knew.

These are angel fish.

They're monogamous.

They should live a long time
if they don't eat each other.

I don't remember most of
last night so if I got a

little Irish on you...

Yeah, I was wrecked.

Right.

Right so...

No need to mention
it to your mom.

Any of it.

Great.

Great.

-Just one.
-Not one.

-Just one.
-Not one.

Alright, you guys,
okay. Come on.

That's enough.
Settle down.

Come on.

Let's all sit down.

He's my boyfriend.

We know, sweetie.

I love him.

He's funny alright.

Yeah, he's a
laugh a minute.

Ed.

You wanna say a prayer.

Sure.

God, we thank you for this
food and we ask you to

take really good
care of Kent.

Amen.

-Amen.
-Amen.

Okay.

Alright.

Looks amazing, mom.

There you go, Willy.

Not one.

Just one.

-Not one.
-Just one.

Hey, none of that, DeeDee.

-Not one.
-Just one.

I mean it, both of you.

Willy, you wanna go back
to the center or you wanna

stay here for dinner?

Just one.

Not one.

Not one.

Okay, you can whisper,
but just once in a while.

He's my boyfriend.

He's cute.

That's for certain.

Yes, baby.

I love him, you know.

I know, sweetheart.

You better.

Thanks for the warning.

Come on, dude...

-Willy.
-Willy.

For god's sakes.

Come on, mom, we're in
the middle of eating.

Willy Crum put
his finger in me.

His finger is in you?

You see, Ed, there's worse
things than being fingered.

The Christmas dance,
we going or what?

Hey, hold on there, champ.

Going to dance?

Yeah, DeeDee, we're going
to the god damn dance.

I'll get the tickets.

Okay.

Mrs. Kendall.

They're not
allowed in here.

What the hell is going on?

Mr. Kendall, it was made
clear to your wife that

DeeDee is no longer
welcome at the box factory.

There won't be a problem
tonight, I promise.

How can you promise that?

Hey, let me make
you a promise.

You don't let my family
into this dance, you're

gonna need a lot more than
a fucking neck brace.

Please escort the Kendall's
off the premises.

I don't want a scene here.

It's too late for that.

Hey! Hey!

Don't touch him.

Don't touch my father.

-Let go of me.
-Alright.

Stop.

Stop.

Come on. Come on. Come on.

Ed, look.

Look.

Forget it.

You okay, son.

Yeah, are you?

Yeah, I'm good.

I don't know
what I'm seeing.

You're seeing the same
thing I'm seeing.

They calm each other down just
like any two people in love.

Hi.

Hi.

What's your name?

This is Annie.

Hi, Annie.
I'm Todd.

Hi.

This is my daughter.

That's my family.

Do you like rabbits?

Actually, I have a rabbit.

Do you wanna dance?

We do.

Do you wanna?

Yeah? Let's do it.

Alright, you gotta lead
though because I'm terrible.

We'll keep DeeDee home.

We'll find a way to pay
for her meds, alright?

I didn't give her
any meds today.

She should be
jumping out windows.

But she's not.

Come on.

Where we going?

I'm gonna dance
with my wife.

Come on.

I admire you, Elaine.

It's like more
than anything else.
