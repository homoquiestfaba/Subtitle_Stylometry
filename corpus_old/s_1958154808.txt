Have you ever wondered what happened to

Harry Pattern your
favourite childhood Idol?

Yes that's me.

I played in a few
other films like

Averages

A Hard Die remake.

Or John Wig.

[Flash sound effect]

[Music playing]

[Bell sound effect]

Hollywood asked me
to be in a reboot but

I'm old and audiences
is need young

energetic actors to
play the lead not a

bum like me.

[Footsteps sound effect]


[Mug Drop]

Recently I lost my wand.

So I use anything I
can find to create magic.

Well let's try this pen

[Magic sound effect]

[Pen Drop]


[Chip... chipâ€¦chip.]

[Mug Drop]


[Door open sound]

I need to take a
break from acting

for many years I
followed each story

every single script
and nobody asked me

"Hey Harry do you
have any stories to tell?"

Nope no one asked me that

I didn't have a
chance to tell my

stories to express
what was in my mind.

[Birds chirping]

So I started to write.

[Birds chirping]

And I write a lot.

[Birds chirping]

[Music playing continuous]


Jessie?

Hey, you must be Drew


You want sit down?

Thank you.

Lie.

At Graceland.

At Graceland I look like I was
the world's youngest elves fan oh

Cheers to that.

Cheers. [Cheers the bottle]

Hmm.

[Bottle Drop]

So Emerson said
you go to a lot of

concerts who's
your favourite band?

All time or like right now?

Right now. Maybe "Wolf pack"

I love them.

Yeah? I just I just
saw them when I

was visiting
friends in New York.

No way where?

Prospect Park

I was at that show.

What or the first
or second night?

Uh...

it was it the one where the girl
ran up on stage and she changed.

Insecurity tackled
her oh my God yes.

Yeah.

That was insane.

So we go and ring
the doorbell her

parents let us in out
of the pouring rain

and then my brother
sees a picture on

the mantle with
the little girl in it

No.

And he goes

that's her that's
the girl we picked up

[Chair creaking]

And then the wife
the she starts sobbing

uncontrollably

the husband he the
husband says she died

15 years ago

then he takes his hand
and puts it on my shoulder

and he says this
happens every year since

Oh my God.

On the day she died.

[Music playing continuous]

I have chills [Laughing]

look I feel like Goosebumps.

You feel cold?


Here let me hear my sweater

I told you it was in the wash

Oh...

I can't believe you're
wearing the shirt.

I thing I love this shirt.

[Heavy breathing]
[Hangers sound]

You found one?

[Heavy breathing]

[Dropping hangers]


Jesse?

I forgot everything
at work I gotta go


[Door closes]

Every single one

not even a plain
white tea? I thought I

found one and
then I unfolded it and

there were cartoon
pubes drawn on the

bottom. That's pretty funny.

Thatâ€™s not funny. It's insane.

Why don't you just
ask him about it?

I panicked I just
left. [Footsteps]

Are you sure this isn't another
classic Jessie move where

you you know find the flaw in an

otherwise perfect
guy? he had at least at

least four shirts with
the word suck on them.

Okay I'm just saying
you did dump a guy

once because he
wore cufflinks? they're

strangely formal it's like wrist

hearings

didn't you say he
was an ER doctor who

helped uninsured
children? yeah and after

your first date you
said you had never

felt so close to
another person so

quickly.

You said that.

[Heavy breathing]

and

wolf pack

ugh... I know.

Wolf pack.

[Heavy breathing]

maybe you're right

[Heavy breathing]

[Heavy breathing]

just go talk to the guy

I'm glad you called.

I'm excited to finally
be able to cook for you.

[Heavy breathing]

Can I talk to you
about something?

Yeah what's up

With all these
dirty joke shirts?

It's all you wear. [Laughing]

yeah they're hilarious

are they?

[Drop spoon]


I don't know

[Music playing]

I spend my day in
Scrub's operating on

kids [Music playing continuous]

sometimes I have
to tell their parents

they didn't make it

it's a lot

[Music playing continuous]

so when I get a
chance to wear some

street clothes I
guess I like to have a

little fun with it

Oh.. [Heavy breathing]

that's actually so so sweet

I'm an asshole.

[Music playing continuous]

I'm glad we talked about this.

I'm glad you're here.

[Music playing continuous]

Bon appetite.

Uh... [Laughing]

[Music playing continuous]

[Flash sound]

[Music playing continuous]

[Flash sound]

[Music playing continuous]

I can't do this.

[Music playing]

Each day seems to
be the same I wake up

I drink some mushroom
coffee and I go

for a walk

[Music playing continuous]

The only difference
is that each day a

different dog barks at me

[Music playing continuous]

[Dog growling]

[Magic sound]

[Duck quacks]

[Music playing continuous]

[Dog growling]

[Magic sound] [Dog growling]
[Music playing continuous]

[Goose clucks] [Music
playing continuous]

[Music playing continuous]

[Dog heavy growling]
[Music playing continuous]

[Magic sound]

[Donkey brays] [Music
playing continuous]

[Music playing continuous]

But I want to be remembered

as a good guy

[Pen drawing]

Of course Thanks girl.

[Music playing]

So Gareth

Alexandra

I heard you study philosophy.

What got you hooked?

The

this might sound
a little bit weird but

when I was in kindergarten I was

diagnosed with ADHD
it's made me think

and feel differently
from the other kids

in my grade this
inspired me to sort of

figure out why the
world made me this

way

one of the benefits
of having ADHD other

than being really
hyper is that you get

fixated on these things

small things I got
fixed on reading

books different
books about different

people's views on
the world and it sort

of made me realise
like Jim Morrison

would say that I was

thrown into the
world this way which

made it my destiny
to be a philosopher

what about you Alex? [Laughing]

what do you study? I'm sorry
if I'm overwhelming you too

much no

um this kind of Energies

[Music playing continuous]

Hot.

[Music playing continuous]


[Heavy breathing] I
go to York for psych

I guess to why I
chose a screw path

that's because you
only needed to see in

high school to
get in but I'm in a

sorority so that's
kind of memories

You know what I'm saying?

Yeah cool

so

Have you decided
on dinner yet by any

chance?

Hey.

Hey

[Music playing continuous]

[Music playing continuous]

[Magic sound]

[Pen creak]

no it's just stupid
a flammable dildo?

Children are probably
going to watch

this

noooo... I need to write
something else [Pen creak]

when you hear anorexic I
know what you [Music playing]

think young girl
teens maybe early 20s

definitely Rich
parents that beg her to

eat dinner and when
she won't they cry

and group hug and
check her into a posh

rehab where she
meets other Rich Young

equally dark and
quirky people and they

do shit like goat
yoga and Equine

Therapy all fucking day then she

Instagrams her thigh
gap and hashtags it

with things like size
double zero skinny

fat Anna Mia thinspo
ugly and self-hate

maybe in a lifetime
movie none of that's

me

Okay maybe the
Instagram thing only when

I need reassurance
but otherwise not me

your grateful narrator
is definitely not

rich

in fact I'm super
late on my rent right

now which is really
pathetic because I

just live in a shitty
room I found on

Craigslist in this
house owned by a

creepy old dude who
looks like he wants

to rape me or eat
me with a glass of

Chianti

I know what you're thinking

she doesn't look
anorexic she's way too

fucking fat

well I'm in recovery
asshole so how

about a little support

but I am a starving
artist ah pun

intended

so it's totally
acceptable to be poor

and spottily employed at 24 25.

Okay 26 to 36 it's
probably a good thing

I've had to struggle
so much you know it

makes me a richer
actor builds character

it's going to happen
for me soon though

I know it

I'm a very positive
optimistic person

and I'm not one of
those actresses who's

never done anything

I was just on
three episodes of a

relatively successful web series

it sucks because
I'm five foot eight and

a quarter so my
weight never sounds

skinny no matter what
my best weight was

106 which was really
an accomplishment

but unfortunately it
doesn't sound very

dramatic everybody
flipped when the

Olsen twins got
down to like 80 pounds

but they're wet
maybe five feet tall and

it's five pounds
for every inch so

comparatively I'd
be equivalent to their

80 pound alleged
skinniness at 120

pounds so unfair
why am I weighing

myself if I'm supposed
to be in recovery

of course I weigh
myself every day how

else are you supposed
to know how you're

going to feel about
yourself that day

totally kidding I know
my value is not a

number on the scale blah blah

mother fucking blah [Bell sound]

so anyway not to
worry your big boned

narrator has got
her shit together

oh that's Mandy she
wanted to walk with

me today

should I wait?

Oh she'll catch up.
So Mandy and our

other friend Shelly
and me were all best

friends in high school
but they were the

popular cheerleaders
National Honor

Society life at the
parties I was the

third wheel who
always got a little too

drunk at the parties
and everything that

came with that

they were supposed
to have peaked in

high school I
believed those after

school specials
that told me things

would get better
after high school when

I could be my real self

but everything
keeps working out for

them

Fuck. Maybe I'm the
one who peaked in

high school nope
nope no more feeling

sorry for myself I promise

[Music playing continuous]

oh I already ate

Lizzy you look
great which obviously

means I look fat I
guess I don't really

worry about it anymore

380 maybe 400
calories in a slice

200 for half wine
140 calories of glass

there's vodka in my
room 65 calories a shot

[Music playing continuous]

You are so lucky to be single

you don't have
someone checking on you

every five minutes
yeah renting a room

from creepy Chianti
Craigslist's guys way better.

So. Have you gotten a job yet?

I know you're still
doing the acting thing

but I mean like a job job

I'm sorry did I order
judgment on my pizza?

Yeah I have a lot of leads

tell me about you

what's it like being
a mom just get past

the pizza be stronger
than the pizza

another glass of
wine is better it's in

vodka if I need it

not gonna lie

but it is just

so 400 plus one of
the most amazing 270

or 280 plus BMR of
about 13.50 so 2150

burned so

um have you been
on Instagram today?

No.

Why?

Okay

I'm gonna tell you
something but I don't

want you to go on
one of your downward

spirals

then maybe you
shouldn't say it like

that

Shelley booked a
series regular on TV.

No fucking way. Wow.

[Music playing continuous]

you both have been
doing this a really

long time so you
know how hard that is

[Music playing continuous]

or that entitled lucky ass
bitch can go fuck herself.

Of course of course

of course doesn't
that give you some

sort of Hope

you guys have the
same agent right

[Music playing]

Yes we have the
same fucking agent.

Why would he get
Shelly that audition

and not me?

She's not fucking cankles

he probably wants to fuck her

or he wants to fuck with my head

of course he's still mad at
me from what [Car door closes]

I know showed that
one audition that was

totally not my fault

he's a psychological
ninja gaslighting

narcissistic
motherfucker. Elizabeth

[Music playing continuous]

you're bloated
struggling narrator is

sick of everybody emotionally

waterboarding her

[Music playing continuous]
[Fast talking sound]

You might think
I'm crazy for riding

alone at 2:30 in the
morning but I'm not

what else am I supposed to do

I'm not one of those
people that says

I'll start tomorrow

that's how 70 percent
of Americans got

to be overweight or obese

[Music playing continuous]

I know I'm not
worried about anybody

attacking me or
anything I'm so fat and

gross right now
nobody's gonna try to

rape me

right now you're
probably thinking I

look like a hopeless
whiny pitiful mess

maybe you can't stand
me right now maybe

you're like can
she fucking shut up.

I get it

I completely fucking
agree [Drop the bottle]

you're worthless fat
ass narrator knows

exactly how shitty
of a person she is

[Music playing continuous]

[Music playing continuous]

[Music playing continuous]

You know how some time you
have one bite and you just can't stop

I guess that's kind
of what happened

last night

but don't worry
you're self-deprecating

narrator has got
it totally under

control

I just need to outrun
my fuck up just

not eat today then
I will be healthy and

optimistic and
positive and shit.

I will

I'll I'll start tomorrow

[Music playing]

Yeah...

Lord Voldemort on
the toilet that could work

but how am I going
to hide his nose?

Also he needs to be shaved

anyway

Uh...

that was something

I didn't know I
could write so many

stories in less than
an hour it has the

potential to be a nice

pattern the brain
not only receives

information but
also interprets and

patterns it I can
tell I'm pleased with

myself [Stomach sound]

oh shit. I knew I should have
drunk five [Stomach sound]

mushroom coffees
in her own time will

not slow down when
something unpleasant

lies at the bottom
of your stomach.

I'll finish the other
characters some other time.
