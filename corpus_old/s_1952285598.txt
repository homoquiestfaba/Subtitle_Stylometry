          Mike Bonanno:
          <i>ARE YOU READY?</i>

          ( chuckles )
    I'M EXTREMELY HAPPY
        TO BE HERE

        BECAUSE TODAY IS
    A VERY HISTORIC OCCASION

      FOR ALL OF US AT DOW.

    AND I AM GRATEFUL.

      LET'S WALK THAT WAY.

         I AM GRATEFUL.

              Mike:
         <i>YOU'RE EXTREMELY</i>
         <i>PLEASED AT THE--</i>

      I'M <i>EXTREMELY</i> PLEASED
        TO BE HERE.

     YES, EXTREMELY PLEASED
    TO BE HERE, STEVE.

              Mike:
 <i>THIS IS MY FRIEND ANDY...</i>

         ( door thuds )

      - HI. <i> BONJOUR.</i>
      - <i>BONJOUR, MONSIEUR.</i>

     <i>...AND MY NAME IS MIKE.</i>

     <i>TODAY I'M HOLDING</i>
           <i>THE CAMERA.</i>

     - AND IS IT OKAY IF--
     - Woman: <i>YES.</i> <i> SURE.</i>

      - IT'S A GOOD THING
        TO KNOW.
      - EXACTLY.

              Mike:
       <i>ANDY IS ABOUT TO GO</i>
       <i>ON LIVE TELEVISION </i>

             <i>IN FRONT</i>
      <i>OF 300 MILLION PEOPLE.</i>

       <i>THEY'RE GONNA THINK</i>
     <i>THAT HE REPRESENTS</i>

   <i>ONE OF THE LARGEST COMPANIES</i>
         <i>IN THE WORLD...</i>

     <i>WHICH HE DOESN'T.</i>

          <i>AND THAT'S WHY</i>
       <i>HE LOOKS SO NERVOUS.</i>

    SHOULD I TYPICALLY
          JUST LOOK...

      - Woman: <i>YEAH.</i>
      - ...RIGHT INTO
        THE CAMERA?  OKAY.

    ( sighs, mutters )
         LET'S SEE HERE.

              Mike:
       <i>ANDY'S ABOUT TO TELL</i>
         <i>A REALLY BIG LIE</i>

      <i>WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY,</i>

          <i>IS GONNA WIPE</i>
         <i>$2 BILLION</i>

     <i>OFF ONE COMPANY'S</i>
           <i>STOCK PRICE.</i>

         <i>BUT BEFORE</i>
     <i>I TELL YOU THIS STORY...</i>

      - ONE MINUTE.
      - <i>...I GUESS </i>
       <i> I SHOULD TELL YOU</i>

       <i>HOW WE GOT OURSELVES</i>
       <i>INTO THIS SITUATION.</i>

         <i>( big band music</i>
         <i>playing )</i>

     - HI, MY NAME'S MIKE.
     - AND I'M ANDY.

    AND THIS IS A MOVIE
    IN WHICH THE TWO OF US...

              Both:
         FIX THE WORLD.

            ( yells )

     <i>AREN'T WE FIXING</i>
     <i>THE WORLD?</i>

        - YES.
        - WELL, COME ON.

        - ( both laugh )
        - I'M SCARED.

        - UH-HUH.
        - ( both laugh )

            NOW WHAT?

          Mike's voice:
          <i>WHAT WE DO IS</i>
     <i>PASS OURSELVES OFF</i>

       <i>AS REPRESENTATIVES </i>
       <i>OF BIG CORPORATIONS</i>
          <i>WE DON'T LIKE.</i>

     <i>( mouse clicking )</i>

      <i>WE MAKE FAKE WEBSITES</i>
      <i>THEN WAIT FOR PEOPLE </i>

 <i>TO ACCIDENTALLY INVITE US</i>
         <i>TO CONFERENCES.</i>

        MY NAME IS FRED.
      I'M FROM HALLIBURTON.

        MY NAME IS
    HANNIFORD SCHMIDT.

    I'M WITH THE WORLD
    TRADE ORGANIZATION.
        I'M FROM ARIZONA.

             MY NAME IS
             FRANCISCO GUERRERO.

    ORBOLOO HOCHMANKS.

         Hundreds of oil
    and gas executives
    were duped today.

      Louisiana officials
      are taken for a ride
         by the Yes Men.

      - The Yes Men.
      - Man: <i>The Yes Men,</i>

   <i>antiglobalization activists</i>
      <i>that travel the world</i>

          <i>pulling pranks</i>
       <i>at corporate events.</i>

             Man #2:
       <i>...a bunch of lefty</i>
          <i>protestors...</i>

        ...world-renowned
        troublemakers...

     Sick, twisted, cruel--

          Man: <i>And what</i>
      <i>they do is they like </i>
      <i>to take absurd ideas,</i>

   <i>and they present these ideas</i>
       <i>in all seriousness.</i>

         ( all chuckle )

         The group has done this
         many times before.

        They have a track record
        of getting away with it.

     So how did this happen?

Equity International says
the imposters showed up...

              Mike:
          <i>AT HOME IN OUR</i>
 <i>UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS,</i>

           <i>IT WAS TIME</i>
     <i>TO START PLANNING</i>
     <i>OUR NEXT MISSION.</i>

          Tom Foreman:
     <i>Tens of thousands</i>
       <i>of Iraqis have died.</i>

    Worries are growing
      among top government
      and business leaders

         about the surge
         of food riots--

            Foreman:
 <i>Markets continue to shake.</i>

       <i>Unemployment is up.</i>

     Oil companies reported
     the highest profits in
    the history of the world.

              Mike:
     <i>BUT WITH SO MANY THINGS</i>
           <i>GOING WRONG,</i>

         <i>WHO SHOULD</i>
     <i>WE GO AFTER NEXT?</i>

     <i>WE GOT OUR ANSWER WHEN </i>
     <i>A TEXT MESSAGE ARRIVED.</i>

            ( thuds )

      Mike: <i>DOW CHEMICAL HAD</i>

 <i>JUST BOUGHT UNION CARBIDE,</i>

      <i>A COMPANY THAT BECAME </i>
      <i>INFAMOUS IN THE 1980s.</i>

           <i>YOU REMEMBER</i>
           <i>THE 1980s-- </i>

           <i>CHALLENGER, </i>
           <i>CHERNOBYL...</i>

             <i>BHOPAL.</i>

             <i>BHOPAL?</i>

             <i>IN 1984</i>
       <i>WHEN UNION CARBIDE'S</i>

         <i>PESTICIDE PLANT</i>
       <i>AT BHOPAL EXPLODED,</i>

      <i>AT LEAST 5,000 PEOPLE</i>
     <i>DIED WITHIN WEEKS</i>

     <i>AND 100,000 MORE REMAIN</i>
          <i>SICK FOR LIFE.</i>

  <i>IT WAS THE BIGGEST INDUSTRIAL</i>
       <i>DISASTER IN HISTORY,</i>

 <i>BUT UNION CARBIDE SETTLED </i>
 <i>WITH THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT</i>

     <i>FOR $470 MILLION,</i>

           <i>MEANING MOST</i>
     <i>OF THE VICTIMS GOT</i>
      <i>LESS THAT $1,000 EACH.</i>

        Warren Anderson:
 <i>NOW I JUST WANT TO SAY TO</i>
  <i>SHAREHOLDERS OF UNION CARBIDE</i>

    THAT I AM CONFIDENT
        THAT THE VICTIMS

          CAN BE FAIRLY
    AND EQUITABLY COMPENSATED

    WITHOUT A MATERIAL
         ADVERSE AFFECT

ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION
  OF UNION CARBIDE CORPORATION.

         Mike: <i>THERE WAS</i>
      <i>LITTLE ADVERSE AFFECT</i>
       <i>ON THE SHAREHOLDERS</i>

          <i>BUT IN BHOPAL,</i>
   <i>PEOPLE CONTINUED TO SUFFER.</i>

     <i>WHEN DOW ANNOUNCED</i>
   <i>IT WOULD BUY UNION CARBIDE,</i>

         <i>THERE WAS</i>
 <i>FINALLY HOPE FOR JUSTICE.</i>

     <i>DOW SAID IT WOULD </i>
     <i>COMPENSATE VICTIMS</i>
   <i>OF CARBIDE'S PAST NEGLIGENCE</i>

     <i>AND PROMPTLY PAID </i>
     <i>OVER $2 BILLION...</i>

       <i>( record scratches )</i>

     <i>...TO 14 ASBESTOS</i>
       <i>PLAINTIFFS IN TEXAS.</i>

     <i>DOW COULD DO FOR BHOPAL</i>
   <i>WHAT THEY'D DONE FOR TEXAS,</i>

           <i>BUT WE KNEW</i>
          <i>THEY WOULDN'T.</i>

          <i>SO WE DECIDED</i>
     <i>TO DO IT FOR THEM.</i>

         <i>WE SET UP A FAKE</i>
      <i>DOW CHEMICAL WEBSITE,</i>

          <i>DowEthics.com,</i>
         <i>AND WE WAITED...</i>

      - <i>AND WAITED...</i>
      - <i>( clock ticking )</i>

          <i>...AND WAITED.</i>

     - <i>THEN ONE DAY</i>
      <i> WE GOT OUR CHANCE.</i>
     - <i>( bell dings )</i>

            Computer:
          <i>You have mail.</i>

              Mike:
      <i>WE'D JUST BEEN INVITED</i>

         <i>TO A CONFERENCE</i>
 <i>ON INTERNATIONAL FINANCE.</i>

 <i>SOME OF THE BIGGEST BANKS</i>
   <i>IN THE WORLD WOULD BE THERE.</i>

       <i>THESE WERE THE KIND</i>
  <i>OF BANKS WHO HELPED COMPANIES</i>

     <i>LIKE UNION CARBIDE</i>
     <i>AND DOW DO WHAT THEY DO.</i>

       <i>A COMPANY MIGHT SAY</i>

      <i>"WE'RE GOING TO BUILD</i>
          <i>A SHODDY PLANT</i>

   <i>IN AN UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRY</i>

          <i>WITH A CORRUPT</i>
          <i>LEGAL SYSTEM. </i>

     <i>THE PLANT MIGHT EXPLODE</i>
      <i>AND PEOPLE MIGHT DIE,</i>

          <i>BUT WE'LL MAKE</i>
         <i>A LOT OF MONEY."</i>

           <i>AND THE BANK</i>
       <i>COMES BACK AND SAYS,</i>

             <i>"GREAT!</i>
       <i>SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN."</i>

         <i>WHAT COULD</i>
          <i>WE POSSIBLY DO</i>

     <i>TO SHOW BANKERS</i>
     <i>WHAT WAS WRONG </i>
     <i>WITH THIS LOGIC?</i>

           <i>SO RIGHT NOW</i>
           <i>I'M PAINTING</i>

              GILDA
      THE GILDED SKELETON--

            ACTUALLY,
      THE GOLDEN SKELETON--

     THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE
IN THE DOW CHEMICAL LECTURE

    IN LONDON AT A FINANCIAL
    SERVICES CONFERENCE

             <i>IN JUST</i>
     <i>A FEW SHORT DAYS.</i>

          THE ONLY GOOD SKELETON
          IS A GOLD SKELETON.

              Mike:
          <i>IN CASE GILDA</i>
     <i>DIDN'T SCARE THEM ENOUGH</i>

      <i>WE HAD A BACKUP PLAN.</i>

     WE RENTED A THEATRICAL
     PYROTECHNICS UNIT HERE

     - <i>SO THAT WE CAN...</i>
     - OH YEAH, THANK YOU.

   <i>...MAKE A BIG PUFF OF SMOKE</i>

          - AH!
          - OH MY GOD.

               Mike:
               <i>WE ARE ON OUR WAY</i>
               <i>TO A CONFERENCE</i>

            AND ERASTUS HAMM IS
            GOING TO BE SPEAKING

        AT THE CONFERENCE
        AS DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY.

          Mike's voice:
       <i>OUR PLAN WAS TO HAVE</i>
         <i>DOW DEMONSTRATE</i>

     <i>FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER</i>

 <i>EXACTLY HOW THEY CALCULATE</i>
  <i>THE CASH VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE.</i>

         <i>WOULD THIS MAKE</i>
     <i>THE BANKERS THINK TWICE?</i>

           <i>IT WAS TIME </i>
           <i>TO FIND OUT.</i>

              Andy:
       <i>THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</i>

        ON MAY 1st WE ARE
RELEASING THE BETA VERSION

      OF "ACCEPTABLE RISK,"

        THE WORLD'S FIRST
  MARKET-SMART RISK CALCULATOR,

           <i>TO HELP YOU</i>
     <i>FIND OUT INSTANTLY</i>

         WHAT RISKS ARE
      OR ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE

     <i>FROM A BOTTOM-LINE</i>
      <i>BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE.</i>

     <i>WILL PROJECT X BE</i>

      <i>JUST ANOTHER SKELETON</i>
          <i>INHE CLOSET,</i>

      <i>SOMETHING YOUR COMPANY</i>
         <i>COMES TO REGRET?</i>

          <i>OR WILL IT BE</i>
     <i>A GOLDEN SKELETON?</i>

         COMPLEX CASE
        IS I.B.M.'S SALE

          OF TECHNOLOGY
     TO WORLD WAR II GERMANY

      <i>FOR USE IN IDENTIFYING</i>
       <i>CERTAIN POPULATIONS.</i>

     <i>THIS WAS VERY BAD,</i>
         <i>OF COURSE,</i>

    BUT NO ONE CAN DENY
      THEY WERE PROFITABLE.

     AND ALTHOUGH THE ISSUE
    REMAINS A SKELETON
         IN THE CLOSET,

      <i>IN RETROSPECT, IT IS </i>
      <i>QUITE CLEARLY GOLDEN.</i>

     NOW YOU MAY HAVE HEARD
  THE JOKE "HOW MANY AMERICANS

      DOES IT TAKE TO SCREW
        IN A LIGHT BULB?

              12--

     ONE TO CLIMB THE LADDER
  AND 11 TO FILE THE LAWSUIT."

          ( all laugh )

      "WHAT ABOUT INDIANS?
         OH, JUST ONE."

        ( silence )

      WE WOULD, OF COURSE,
      NEVER WISH TO IMPLY

    THAT AN INDIAN LIFE
      IS WORTH MORE OR LESS
          THAN ANOTHER.

        I MYSELF BELIEVE
        IN THE SANCTITY
          OF ALL LIFE.

     <i>BUT THE MARKET HAS</i>
          <i>ITS OWN LOGIC,</i>

       <i>AND IF WE'RE WILLING</i>
         <i>TO LIVE WITH IT,</i>

      <i>WE MUST MAKE THE MOST</i>
     <i>OF THE CHOICES IT MAKES.</i>

     <i>BECAUSE IF THERE'S</i>
         <i>ONE THING</i>

     THAT WE AT DOW WANT YOU
    TO REMEMBER TODAY,

          IT'S THAT
          THE ONLY GOOD SKELETON

    IS A GOLD SKELETON.

OOH!
( audience applauding )

                SURPRISE.
                ( chuckles )

            THIS IS GILDA.
            SHE'S THE MASCOT

      <i>FOR THE DOW</i>
      <i>"ACCEPTABLE RISK" PROGRAM.</i>

           <i>GILDA IS HERE</i>
           <i>TO BASICALLY TELL YOU</i>

       <i>THAT IF YOU HAVE</i>
       <i>A SKELETON IN THE CLOSET,</i>

                IT MAY NOT BE
                JUST A SKELETON.

      <i>IT COULD VERY WELL BE</i>
      <i>A GOLDEN SKELETON AS WELL.</i>

                 <i>AND AS YOU MOVE</i>
                 <i>INTO A FUTURE</i>

              <i>OF EVER-INCREASING</i>
              <i>COMPLEXITY</i>

             <i>AND EVER-INCREASING</i>
             <i>OPPORTUNITIES,</i>

             <i>DOW ACCEPTABLE RISK</i>
             <i>CAN ASSURE YOU</i>

          <i>THAT YOUR TOUCH</i>
          <i>WILL BE THE MIDAS ONE.</i>

        ( sneezes )

          <i>AND I'D LIKE TO FINISH</i>
          <i>WITH A LITTLE POEM.</i>

        "I'D RATHER BE
        HANDSOME THAN HOMELY,

        I'D RATHER
        BE YOUTHFUL THAN OLD,

             IF I CAN'T HAVE
             A BUSHEL OF SILVER,

         I'LL DO
         WITH A BARREL OF GOLD."

         SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
         WE HOPE YOU COME UP

<i>AND GET A CLOSER LOOK.</i>
<i>( applauding )</i>

        - ( murmuring )
        - THANK YOU.

     - THANKS A LOT.
     - <i>THANK YOU.</i> <i> THANKS.</i>

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HERE IS A KEYCHAIN.

 <i>THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</i>
 <i>ABSOLUTELY.</i>

    - THANK YOU.
    - UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T
      HAVE A CARD ANYMORE,

      - I RAN OUT OF THEM.
      - OH WONDERFUL.

        YES, YOU WERE ONE
    OF THE EARLIER SPEAKERS.

    - THANKS.
    - YES.  IT'S A PLEASURE.

<i>THANK YOU.</i>
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING.

        IS IT APPLICABLE--
        IS YOUR MODEL APPLICABLE
        TO ANYTHING?

        I MEAN, CAN WE USE IT
        IN RISK MANAGEMENT?

         <i>OH, ABSOLUTELY.</i>
         <i>YEAH YEAH YEAH.</i>

            I'LL HAVE OUR
            RISK-MANAGEMENT GUYS
            TAKE A LOOK AT IT,

          'CAUSE WE DO A LOT
          OF INTERESTING THINGS.

        WONDERFUL.
    THIS IS INTERESTING

        - THANKS A LOT.
        - THANK YOU.

    - OKAY, TAKE CARE.
    - YES, HELLO.

             HELLO.

        - Andy: <i>MM-HMM.</i>
        - AND YOU--

              Andy:
          <i>THAT'S RIGHT.</i>

         <i>( Andy laughs )</i>
     <i>YEAH, WELL-- YEAH.</i>

    - ( all chuckle )
    - IS THAT RIGHT?

 <i>WELL, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH--</i>

       <i>YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY</i>
           <i>WHAT I SAID.</i>

              <i>IT'S--</i>

     <i>DID YOU FIND THAT NOT--</i>

              <i>OKAY.</i>

              Mike:
           <i>REFRESHING?</i>

     <i>WE MEANT TO BE SHOCKING,</i>
     <i>NOT REFRESHINGLY HONEST.</i>

         <i>TO US, THIS WAS</i>
      <i>ABOUT AS REFRESHING AS</i>
 <i>THE KOOL-AID IN JONESTOWN.</i>

              Man:
   <i>The mass suicide and murder</i>
   <i>of more than 900 Americans </i>

             <i>who took</i>
 <i>cyanide-laced fruit punch</i>

         <i>from their</i>
         <i>spiritual father</i>

             <i>and then</i>
     <i>laid down to die.</i>

              Mike:
         <i>THAT'S THE THING</i>
          <i>ABOUT CULTS--</i>

         <i>WHAT'S SHOCKING</i>
           <i>TO OUTSIDERS</i>

           <i>SEEMS NORMAL</i>
           <i>TO INSIDERS.</i>

             <i>IS THIS</i>
       <i>WHY UNFETTERED GREED</i>

          <i>SEEMED NORMAL</i>
           <i>TO BANKERS?</i>

     <i>AND IF SO, WHO WAS</i>
      <i>THE CULT LEADER HERE?</i>

             <i>THIS IS</i>
         <i>MILTON FRIEDMAN.</i>

     <i>WE WERE TOLD THAT </i>
     <i>HE WAS THE WORLD'S</i>

         <i>MOST INFLUENTIAL</i>
         <i>ECONOMIST.</i>

    DID GOVERNMENT PLAY
         A ROLE IN THIS?

          VERY LITTLE.
         ONLY BY KEEPING
         THE ROAD CLEAR

         FOR HUMAN GREED
        AND SELF-INTEREST

     TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE
        OF THE CONSUMER.

              Mike:
   <i>IN THIS BOOK, FRIEDMAN USED</i>

         <i>THE WORD FREEDOM</i>
         <i>374 TIMES.</i>

         <i>BUT BY FREEDOM,</i>
       <i>HE DIDN'T MEAN THIS.</i>

         <i>HE MEANT THIS--</i>

           <i>THE FREEDOM</i>
         <i>OF CORPORATIONS</i>
         <i>TO PROFIT,</i>

         <i>NO MATTER</i>
     <i>THE RISK TO PEOPLE</i>

     <i>AND WITHOUT INTERFERENCE</i>
         <i>FROM GOVERNMENT.</i>

      DR. MILTON FRIEDMAN--
          A SCIENTIST,

        A CAREFUL THINKER
      AND A GREAT TEACHER--

         George W. Bush:
       <i>A HERO OF FREEDOM--</i>
         <i>MILTON FRIEDMAN.</i>

    I SOUGHT OUT DR. FRIEDMAN

AND HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE
          AND PRIVILEGE

         OF MEETING HIM
  AND HIS ECONOMIST WIFE ROSE.

            WE'VE ALL
         BECOME FRIENDS,

             AND NOW
    I CALL HIM MILTON.

              Mike:

              Mike:
       <i>BUT THOUGH FRIEDMAN</i>
     <i>HAD NOW ASCENDED,</i>

      <i>HIS FOLLOWERS CARRIED</i>
         <i>THE FLAME.</i>

    OKAY, SO WE SHOULD
          GO IN THERE?

      - Man: <i>YEAH.</i>
      - GREAT.  THANK YOU.

     Andy:
     <i>WE'RE KIND OF</i>
     <i>ON A QUEST.</i>

    WE WANT

        PRIVATE PROPERTY,
        RULE OF LAW

    AND A MARKET UNRESTRICTED

          BY GOVERNMENT
     REGULATION AND CONTROL.

        WHEN WE SEE
      COMPANIES DEMONIZED,

         WE SHOULD WORK
         AGAINST THAT.

        WHEN WE SEE
         THE FREE-MARKET

          <i>WE MUST WORK </i>
          <i>AGAINST THAT.</i>

          MORE WEALTH LEADS

    GREATER INNOVATION

        AND, BASICALLY,
        ALL GOOD THINGS.

        - WEALTH.
        - MONEY.

        - PRIVATIZATION.
        - WEALTH.

    - MONEY.
    - INDIVIDUALIST FREEDOM.

        - PRIVATIZATION.
         - FREE MARKETS.

  - OWNERSHIP.
  - AND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.

     CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM.

     WEALTH AND PROSPERITY.

          DON'T PUT ME

    I HATE WASHINGTON.

         PUT UP A SCENE
         IN OUTER SPACE
          OR SOMETHING.

        I WOULD SAY
        A WORLD IN WHICH

         MAN IS TREATED
      AS AN END IN HIMSELF

    RATHER THAN A TOOL
    TO BE MANIPULATED

            BY THOSE
      WITH POLITICAL POWER.

              HOW CAN
              WE REPRESENT THAT?

            IS THERE
            A SINGLE IMAGE OR...

    A SERIES
    OF IMAGES?

          I THINK THAT
         THE IMAGES ARE

            OF MEN--

    JUST THE PROSPERITY
        OF FREE MEN

         FOLLOWING WHAT
    THEIR HEARTS AND DESIRES

         LEAD THEM TOO.

      - I THINK
        WE CAN FIND THAT.
      - SOUNDS GOOD.

              Mike:
         <i>NOW THAT WE HAD</i>
     <i>OUR NEW FRIENDS AT EASE</i>

     <i>IT WAS TIME TO ASK THEM</i>
   <i>THE REALLY TOUGH QUESTIONS.</i>

WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO PEOPLE WHO HARP ON

THE BHOPAL CATASTROPHE
OR OTHER TRAGEDIES?

          Man: <i>BHOPAL IS</i>
     <i>AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE.</i>

    THAT FACILITY HAD CREATED
    EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

     FOR AN INDIAN EMERGING
    TECHNOCRATIC CLASS.

         IT HAD CREATED
        VALUE ADDED

          AND TAX BASE
    FOR THE COMMUNITY,

    AND SOMETHING LIKE
    3,000 PEOPLE DIED.

        THAT'S A TRAGEDY,
BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS RISKS

            OF GOING
        INTO THE FUTURE.

              Mike:
     <i>"THERE ARE ALWAYS RISKS</i>
 <i>OF GOING INTO THE FUTURE"?</i>

          <i>FOR THOUSANDS</i>
       <i>OF PEOPLE IN BHOPAL,</i>

       <i>THERE</i> WAS <i>NO FUTURE.</i>

        LET'S SEE.

WHEN WE GET THERE, I THINK.

         ( door thuds )

      - HI. <i>BONJOUR.</i>
      - <i>BONJOUR, MONSIEUR.</i>

You're watching BBC World,
    our main headlines.

     <i>The world's worst</i>
       <i>industrial accident</i>

    is being remembered
         in India today.

          It's 20 years
     since deadly gas leaked

      <i>from the Union Carbide</i>
          <i>chemical plant</i>

           <i>in the city</i>
           <i>of Bhopal. </i>

      <i>At least 18,000 deaths</i>
   <i>are attributed to the leak,</i>

             <i>and many</i>
         <i>local people say</i>

     <i>that the contamination </i>
     <i>has never been properly</i>
           <i>cleared up.</i>

    YEAH, SHOULD I TYPICALLY
          JUST LOOK...

      - Woman: <i>YEAH.</i>
      - ...RIGHT INTO
        THE CAMERA?  OKAY.

        The factory
        still exists here

         and that's been
         a real problem

         for the people
      living here locally.

         <i>The site--</i>
         <i>I've been to it,</i>

          <i>and it's full</i>
         <i>of toxic waste.</i>

      <i>People who are living</i>
         <i>in these houses,</i>

         <i>they've all got</i>
         <i>a story to tell</i>

          <i>about that day</i>
          <i>20 years ago. </i>

    Many of them lost members
        of their family,

      and they say they are
      continuing to suffer

     because of the tragedy.
    And they're saying

          <i>somebody needs</i>
       <i>to answer for this.</i>

   <i>Legally, what they're saying</i>
      <i>is they want to pursue</i>

     <i>the company to try</i>
      <i>and clean up the site.</i>

     <i>But whether the company</i>
      <i>will accept liability</i>
         <i>seems doubtful.</i>

      Well, joining us live
        from Paris now is
        Jude Finisterra.

         <i>He's a spokesman</i>
     <i>for Dow Chemicals,</i>

         <i>which took over</i>
         <i>Union Carbide.</i>

       <i>Good morning to you.</i>

          A day of commemoration
          in Bhopal.

            Do you now accept
            responsibility

            for what happened?

        Steve, yes,
      today is a great day

      for all of us at Dow

          and, I think,
     for millions of people

        around the world
            as well.

          It's 20 years
    since the disaster

    and today I'm very
     very happy to announce

     that for the first time
        Dow is accepting

    full responsibility
for the Bhopal catastrophe.

             We have
    a $12 billion plan

        to finally,
          at long last,

        fully compensate
          the victims,

      including the 120,000
    who may need medical care

     for their entire lives,

    AND TO FULLY AND SWIFTLY

            REMEDIATE
     THE BHOPAL PLANT SITE.

      Now when we acquired
  Union Carbide three years ago

          we knew what
        we were getting,

         and it's worth
          $12 billion.

          $12 billion.

        We have resolved
  to liquidate Union Carbide--

  this nightmare for the world
  and this headache for Dow--

     and use the $12 billion

    TO ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE
          THE VICTIMS.

          Jude, that's good news
          that you have finally

    accepted responsibility--

             some people
             would say too late.

        It's three years,
        almost four years on.

        When we acquired
          Union Carbide

          we did settle
        their liabilities

      in the United States
          immediately.

        And we are now--
    three years later--

         prepared to do
    the same in India.

         We should have
    done it three years ago.
      We are doing it now.

          I WOULD ALSO
      LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS
    IS NO SMALL MATTER.

     THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
        IN HISTORY

  that a publicly-owned company

        of anything
      near the size of Dow

          has performed
            an action

     which is significantly
    against its bottom line,

         simply because
it's the right thing to do.

      Our shareholders may
take a bit of a hit, Steve,

        but I think that
  if they're anything like me,

      they will be ecstatic
        to be part

             of such
    a historic occasion

         of doing right
  by those that we've wronged.

        Just to reiterate
      what Jude Finisterra,

          the spokesman
    for Dow Chemicals,
         has just said:

      he says Dow Chemicals
        now fully accept

          <i>responsibility</i>
 <i>for the events in Bhopal.</i>

      - GREAT.  THAT'S IT?
      - WELL DONE.

             GREAT.
    NOW THEY WANTED...

         - NOW YOU DO--
         - ...RADIO.

         I CAN TELL YOU
        ONE THING:

        WE'RE NOT GOING
        OUT OF BUSINESS.

        WE WILL CONTINUE
        TO MAKE PROFIT;

      WE WILL SIMPLY MAKE
      SLIGHTLY LESS PROFIT
          THAN NORMAL.

        BUT WE ARE DOING
        THE RIGHT THING.

      WE'RE COMPARING HERE
    THE VALUE OF MONEY

          TO THE VALUE
         OF HUMAN LIFE,

          AND THERE IS
         NO COMPARISON.

        ( woman speaks )

    EXACTLY.  I MEAN,
    HOW OFTEN DOES DOW
    GET TO-- YOU KNOW.

          ( chuckles )
      I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE

    A DOW SPOKESPERSON
        OTHERWISE.

              GOOD.

        OH MY GOD.
        OH MY <i>GOD.</i>

    I'M GONNA HAVE A SERIOUS
     NERVOUS BREAKDOWN NOW.

"DOW ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY
    FOR BHOPAL-- SPOKESMAN."

     - Mike: <i>WHERE'S THAT?</i>
     - Andy: <i>IN REUTERS.</i>

        "CONGRATULATIONS.
        YOUR APPEARANCE--

          EVERYONE HERE
    AT B.B.C. CHEERED."

        IT'S OVER AN HOUR
  AND IT'S STILL HEADLINE NEWS.

      HELLO, THIS IS JUDE.

    WHO HAS SAID THAT?

    PERHAPS THEY'RE NOT
        IN COMMUNICATION

         WITH THE DOW--
    WITH THE DOW LEADERSHIP.

         ( phone rings )

             HELLO?

          YES, THIS IS
        JUDE FINISTERRA.

              SURE.

             RIGHT.

              SURE.

             RIGHT.

          LET ME JUST--

      YES, COULD I ASK YOU
        TO EITHER--

      TO HOLD FOR A MOMENT?
        OKAY, THANK YOU.

         ( whispering )

      WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY
          IT'S A HOAX.

         IT'S AN HONEST
         REPRESENTATION

           OF WHAT DOW
         <i>SHOULD</i> BE DOING.

         Maria Ashanin:
  <i>This morning a false statement</i>

     <i>was carried by BBC World</i>

     <i>regarding responsibility</i>
     <i>for the Bhopal tragedy. </i>

     <i>The individual who made</i>
          <i>this statement</i>

     <i>identified himself</i>
      <i>as a Dow spokesperson </i>
      <i>named Jude Finisterra.</i>

           <i>Dow confirms</i>
          <i>that there was</i>

       <i>no basis whatsoever</i>
         <i>for this report.</i>

    Well, earlier today
     we carried an interview

    with someone purporting
    to be from Dow Chemical,

         a company which
    subsequently bought
  the plant from Union Carbide.

         This interview
         was inaccurate

             <i>and part</i>
 <i>of an elaborate deception.</i>

              Andy:
           <i>TAKE A LOOK</i>
          <i>AT THIS NOW--</i>

          LOOK AT THIS.
         THIS IS THE TOP
         OF GOOGLE NEWS.

    "DOW SAID ON FRIDAY
  THERE WAS NO BASIS WHATSOEVER

 IN A B.B.C. WORLD REPORT SAYING
THEY HAD ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY

        FOR INDIA'S
        BHOPAL DISASTER."

    THAT'S A FUNNY SENTENCE.

          The hoax was
        an elaborate one

            involving
         a fake website.

Down Chemical
was quick to issue
a series of statements

denying all knowledge
of Jude Finisterra.

      Also tonight, backtracking
      because of this man...

        WE'RE GOING BACK
    TO THE B.B.C. TELEVISION
        STUDIO RIGHT NOW

          THAT WE WERE
         AT THIS MORNING

        BECAUSE THEY WANT
         TO TALK TO US.

          OKAY, WHAT DO
    THEY WANT TO KNOW?

    WELL, LET'S GO SEE.

             <i>( woman speaks )</i>

            - YEAH.
            - HI.

        - HI.  SORRY.
        - ( all laugh )

( man speaks )

         IT DIDN'T OCCUR
          TO US AT ALL.

        WE GOT CONTACTED
          BY YOU GUYS.

 <i>( man speaks )</i>

    - YEAH, I DID HEAR THAT.
       HAS IT GONE BACK UP?
     - Man: <i>I'M SURE IT HAS.</i>

Well, the prank
which briefly
knocked 3% off

Dow shares comes
20 years to the day

after the chemical leak

from the Union Carbide
plant in Bhopal.

              Man:
         <i>Today's unlikely</i>
      <i>corporate humiliation </i>

      <i>of a US chemical giant</i>

          <i>was all about</i>
       <i>reminding the world </i>

       <i>that Bhopal remains</i>
     <i>an unhealed sore.</i>

      Well, earlier I spoke
        to Andy Bichlbaum

and I asked him what he did
      when he got an email

     from the BBC asking him
        for an interview.

    Essentially, Dow has been
    promulgating a hoax

        by which they've
        convinced people

    that they can't do
     anything about Bhopal,

     that they cannot accept
         responsibility.

And we wanted to prove that
     that was not accurate.

            Nevertheless,
            a pretty cruel
            trick to play

             <i>on the people</i>
             <i>of Bhopal.</i>

     - Well, we--
     - Did you think about
       the people of Bhopal

        when you decided
        to peddle this stunt?

    Yes.  Yes, we did.

     Well, that surely is
     the tragedy of today.

      You spring upon them
      the hoax that they--

            they actually
            suddenly believe

            that they have got
            a payout from Dow,

    then an hour or two later
    they find it's untrue.

         Let's put this
          in contrast:

    We may have given people
    two hours of false hope,

    Dow has given them
     20 years of suffering.

         I mean this is
     what we're faced with.

      Are you expecting
      the next knock at the door
      to be Dow's lawyer?

             No idea
        what Dow will do.

              Mike:
 <i>DOW'S LAWYERS DIDN'T CALL.</i>

      <i>AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE</i>
 <i>LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME</i>

     <i>THAT 20 YEARS ON,</i>
   <i>BHOPAL WAS NEVER CLEED UP.</i>

   <i>BUT THE MEDIA ALSO REPORTED</i>

         <i>THAT MANY</i>
     <i>OF THE VICTIMS IN BHOPAL</i>

     <i>CRIED TEARS OF JOY</i>
      <i>UPON HEARING THE NEWS.</i>

      <i>HAD WE ACTUALLY UPSET</i>
  <i>THE PEOPLE WE'D MEANT TO HELP?</i>

          <i>THERE WAS ONLY</i>
       <i>ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.</i>

          HERE WE ARE.

      <i>BHOPAL IS A BIG CITY.</i>

           <i>THERE'S OVER</i>
      <i>A MILLION PEOPLE HERE.</i>

     UNFORTUNATELY WE HEARD
FROM A LOT OF NEWS REPORTS

        THAT THE VICTIMS
         HERE IN BHOPAL

      WERE EXTREMELY UPSET

         BECAUSE WE HAD
    RAISED FALSE HOPES

    ABOUT THEM ACTUALLY
    GETTING SOME COMPENSATION

         <i>AFTER 21 YEARS.</i>
     <i>WHAT DO YOU THINK</i>
           <i>THEY'LL DO?</i>

 WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
 WHAT'S THE LOCAL CUSTOM HERE?

      ( yelling in Hindi )

    - ( mimicking choking )

         Mike: <i>WE'RE HERE</i>

                THEY WERE LIVING

        OR WERE THEY SLEEPING

         <i>WE GOT THE NEWS</i>

          WE FELT THE NEWS WAS
          TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE...

UH-HUH.
...AND DOW WAS TOO BAD
  FOR THE NEWS TO BE TRUE.

      - YEAH.
      - STILL, WE THOUGHT
        MAYBE IT IS TRUE,

        MAYBE THEY'RE JUST
        SEEING SENSE IN THIS.

    FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WE WERE
    UNDER THAT IMPRESSION.

YEAH.
DID PEOPLE CRY...

          - WITH JOY?
          - I CRIED.

    - OH NO.
    - LOTS OF PEOPLE CRIED.

WERE YOU KIND OF ANGRY
AT FIRST, THOUGH,

WHEN YOU HEARD
  IT WAS A HOAX?
NO, I WASN'T ANGRY.  NO.

    WOW.

      - DO YOU THINK
        IT WAS WORTH IT?
      - TOTALLY WORTH IT.

          <i>WE ARE SAYING</i>
         <i>NO MORE BHOPAL.</i>

         <i>WHAT PEOPLE HAVE</i>
     <i>GONE THROUGH HERE,</i>

     <i>NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD</i>

          I THINK WE'RE

          AND IT'S BEEN
    A LITTLE BIT OF A--

          A BIT OF A--

    WELL, A BIT OF A--

      A MAZE GETTING HERE.

          A LITTLE--
          WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?

          WE GOT LOST.

    THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED.

    WE'RE TRYING TO MEET UP

HERE HE IS.

                     HERE HE IS.
                     OH MY GOD.

          Mike's voice:
      <i>RAJKUMAR KESWANI BROKE</i>
       <i>THE DISASTER STORY.</i>

             <i>IN FACT,</i>
     <i>HE BROKE IT YEARS BEFORE</i>
      <i>IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.</i>

    SO YOU HAD ALREADY
    PREDICTED HOW MANY TIMES

THAT THE DISASTER WOULD
HAPPEN BEFORE IT HAPPENED?

WHEN YOU HEARD
IT WAS A HOAX,
THE THING THAT WE DID,

WERE YOU, LIKE--
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF IT... AT FIRST?

    I THOUGHT THAT WAS
    A WONDERFUL THING TO DO.

        WE WERE PUT
        INTO A SITUATION

         WHICH WE NEVER
        THOUGHT OF,

        THAT WOULD
        ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

    SO IT IS JUST LIKE
      BEING IN THE HEAVEN.

 <i>( guys laughing )</i>

        SO IF ONE--

      IF I'M EXPECTING HELL

      AND SOMEONE PUTS ME,

 <i>I GOT A CALL FROM MY CLERK</i>
   <i>IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT--</i>

        DOW CHEMICAL MADE
        SOME ANNOUNCEMENT

      THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS
  OF DOW CHEMICAL DIDN'T LIKE,

        BECAUSE DOW STOCK
        WENT DOWN,

       <i>THE S&P 500 FUTURES</i>
         <i>WENT DOWN.</i>

  I HAD TO GO ROLL OUT OF BED.
     MY CLERK'S FREAKING OUT

      BECAUSE MY POSITION'S
        GOING AGAINST ME.

    MY FRIEND TELLS ME
    HE THINKS IT'S SOME
        GLOBAL CONSPIRACY

        OF TRADERS
    TO TRY TO SCREW US,

        AND HE FINDS OUT
        IT'S TWO JOKERS.

              Mike:
     <i>THE EFFECT OF OUR</i>
  <i>BIG ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE B.B.C.</i>

     <i>WAS THAT DOW STOCK</i>
       <i>LOST OVER $2 BILLION</i>

          <i>IN 23 MINUTES.</i>

          THIS TELLS ME
    ALL THE NEWS THAT'S

    SO ON DECEMBER 3rd
      IF I WAS SITTING HERE

         WATCHING THIS,
          IT WOULD SAY,

          "DOW CHEMICAL
        DECIDES TO SETTLE
    WITH THE BHOPAL PEOPLE."

         AND PEOPLE THAT
    OWNED DOW CHEMICAL
        WOULD BE LIKE...

        ( screams )
             "SOLD!"

EVERYBODY WE TALKED TO
ABOUT THAT WAS REALLY HAPPY

THAT DOW WAS DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

    SURE.  SURE, OKAY.

         I'M NOT SAYING
     THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE.

      I'M JUST SAYING THAT,

       <i>SURE, IT SEEMS LIKE</i>
           <i>A GOOD THING</i>

          <i>UNLESS YOU'RE</i>
 <i>A DOW CHEMICAL STOCKHOLDER</i>

      AND YOU'RE EXPECTING
         THE $20 BILLION

    TO GO TOWARDS A DIVIDEND
    TO COME BACK TO YOU

         OR TO COME BUY
    SOME NEW CHEMICAL PLANT.

         AND IT'S GOING
      TO THESE PEOPLE THAT,

     AT LEAST AT THIS POINT,
  AREN'T ABLE TO GET ANY MONEY.

          YOU COULD SEE
     HOW THEY WOULD BE UPSET
    ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?

              Mike:
     <i>WE WERE CONFUSED.</i>

     <i>AS KIDS, WE LEARNED THAT</i>

         <i>IT WAS BAD</i>
       <i>TO DO SOMETHING BAD,</i>

          <i>AND IF YOU DID</i>
          <i>SOMETHING GOOD</i>

     <i>YOU GOT A REWARD.</i>

      <i>YET WHEN WE ANNOUNCED</i>
  <i>DOW WOULD DO SOMETHING</i> GREAT,

         <i>THE MARKET GAVE</i>
         <i>DOW A SPANKING.</i>

           <i>SO HOW COULD</i>
         <i>WE GET COMPANIES</i>
      <i>TO DO THE RIGHT THING?</i>

  - <i>( alarm blaring )</i>
  - Mike: <i>WE NEEDED TO CHANGE</i>
   <i> THE RULES OF THE MARKET,</i>

 <i>BUT THAT MEANT REGULATION,</i>

          <i>AND REGULATION</i>
     <i>MEANT GOVERNMENT.</i>

       <i>THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS</i>

          <i>GOVERNMENT WAS</i>
       <i>DRINKING FRIEDMAN'S</i>
      <i>FREE-MARKET KOOL-AID.</i>

             Reagan:
     <i>FREE MARKETS ARE WORKING</i>
      <i>MIRACLE AFTER MIRACLE</i>

       <i>OF ECONOMIC GROWTH.</i>

            Clinton:
           <i>OPEN MARKETS</i>
       <i>AND RULE-BASED TRADE</i>

       <i>ARE THE BEST ENGINES</i>
           <i>WE KNOW OF.</i>

    THEN THE GOVERNMENT
          STEPPED BACK

AND LET THE FREE ENTERPRISE
    SYSTEM DO ITS WORK.

     THEN THE BETTER WE DID,

         THE MORE ROBUST
        OUR ECONOMY GREW,

        THE BETTER
      I DID AND THE BETTER
        MY BUSINESS GREW.

       <i>THE LEADERS OF MOST</i>

           <i>DID WHATEVER</i>
       <i>THE FREE-MARKETEERS</i>
           <i>RECOMMENDED.</i>

 <i>AND WHAT THEY RECOMMENDED</i>
           <i>WAS SIMPLE.</i>

    THE SOLUTION IS <i>NOT</i>

  TO HAVE GOVERNMENT INTERVENE
    OR REGULATE IN SOME WAY.

  IN FACT, MOST PROBLEMS WILL
  SOLVE THEMSELVES IF IGNORED.

     LET FREE PEOPLE WORKING
  IN FREE MARKETS ADDRESS THEM.

              Mike:
   <i>FOLLOWING ADVICE LIKE THIS,</i>

     <i>GOVERNMENTS AROUND</i>
     <i>THE WORLD GOT RID </i>

         <i>OF A WHOLE BUNCH</i>
       <i>OF REGULATIONS MEANT</i>
     <i>TO PROTECT PEOPLE,</i>

         <i>LIKE IN BANKING.</i>

         ( stammering )
    I'M CONFIDENT THAT

    THE DEGREE OF HARM
      OR SPILLOVER EFFECT,

        WHATEVER SUBPRIME

      THAT THE MARKET WILL
        DEVISE WAYS

    Global warming is silly.
    It's not a serious issue.

Warmer is healthier,

warmer is
more pleasant

and that's why states
like Arizona keep gaining
population rapidly.

    THERE ARE BENEFITS
    TO GLOBAL WARMING.

    COLD-RELATED DEATHS

    WHAT WITH CLIMATE CHANGE
          AND ALL THAT,

          <i>IT'S PEOPLE--</i>
          <i>DEAD PEOPLE. </i>

     <i>THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM</i>
     <i>TO USE THAT FUEL.</i>

      IT'S CALLED VIVOLEUM,

        AND HERE WE ARE,
        MAKING VIVOLEUM.

              Mike:
         <i>AS LEE RAYMOND'S</i>
         <i>ASSISTANT,</i>

         <i>ANDY WOULD</i>
       <i>ANNOUNCE VIVOLEUM--</i>
       <i>EXXON'S NEW BIOFUEL</i>

         <i>TO BE MADE</i>
         <i>FROM THE VICTIMS</i>
     <i>OF CLIMATE CHANGE.</i>

          <i>AND HE'D EVEN</i>
     <i>HAND OUT A SAMPLE.</i>

    SO IT STARTED OUT,
    WE MADE ONE REGGIE,

        AND THEN WE CAST
A BUNCH OF REGGIES IN WAX.

        THAT'S HUMAN HAIR
          RIGHT THERE.

              Andy:
          <i>THIS IS A LOT</i>
         <i>OF EXPERIMENTING</i>

        TO FIGURE OUT HOW
     TO MAKE A CANDLE SMELL
        LIKE HUMAN FLESH.

OW!  I LOST
A REGGIE.

            - QUICK!
            - OW!

              Mike:
      <i>WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE</i>
      <i>THAT THE OIL MEN KNEW </i>

     <i>WHAT THE CANDLES </i>
     <i>THEY'D BE HOLDING</i>
          <i>WERE MADE OF.</i>

     <i>SO WE'D SHOW THEM</i>
         <i>A TRIBUTE VIDEO</i>

         <i>TO REGGIE WATTS,</i>

         <i>A TERMINALLY ILL</i>
          <i>EXXON JANITOR</i>

       <i>WHO HAD VOLUNTEERED</i>
     <i>TO BE TURNED INTO FUEL.</i>

    I THINK I'D LIKE TO BE--
        I THINK I'D LIKE
        TO BE A CANDLE.

        I THINK A CANDLE
          WOULD BE FUN,

      BECAUSE THERE'S JUST
SO MANY USES FOR A CANDLE.

  THERE ARE SIX BILLION PEOPLE
      ON THIS EARTH TODAY.

      WE'RE PROBABLY USING
      THE ENERGIES, MAYBE,

          OF A BILLION
        OF THOSE AT BEST.

        THEY HAD ME TEST
    A HELLFIRE MISSILE ONCE.

      THAT WAS PRETTY COOL.

     WE SIMPLY HAVEN'T FOUND

      THE MIRACLE FUEL YET
      TO REPLACE PETROLEUM,

         <i>BUT WE'LL</i>
       <i>EVENTUALLY GET THERE</i>

     <i>IF GOVERNMENT GETS</i>
         <i>OUT OF THE WAY.</i>

    - THIS IS HOW IT WORKS.
    - Mike: <i>WE HAD HIS</i>
     <i> MIRACLE FUEL,</i>

       <i>AND OUR GRANDFATHERS</i>
       <i>WERE TURNING OVER IN</i>
     <i>THEIR MASS GRAVES.</i>

     <i>( dramatic music plays )</i>

        Announcer:
 <i>CTV news with Barb Higgins</i>
         <i>and Darrel Janz.</i>

    Good evening.
    A bizarre situation today

            at the GO EXPO
            energy conference
            at Stampede Park.

Organizers and hundreds

of Alberta oil and gas
executives got duped.

         Male reporter:
      <i>They had been promised</i>
       <i>a major announcement</i>

       <i>from a major player</i>
     <i>in the energy industry.</i>

 <i>Attendees paid $50 a head</i>
       <i>to hear this speech</i>

     <i>from the National </i>
     <i>Petroleum Council,</i>

       <i>a group that advises</i>
      <i>the White House on oil</i>
         <i>and gas matters.</i>

              Man:
       <i>WELCOME TO GO EXPO'S</i>
     <i>KEYNOTE LUNCHEON.</i>

         PLEASE WELCOME
        S.K. WOLFF.

    FIRST I NEED TO SAY
HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO SEE,

        ON ALL THE FACES
        HERE TODAY,

    THE CHILDLIKE EXUBERANCE
    OF A GREAT INDUSTRY

         IN FULL FLOWER.

           <i>AND WHY NOT?</i>
           <i>WITHOUT OIL,</i>

   <i>AT LEAST FOUR BILLION PEOPLE</i>
          <i>WOULD STARVE.</i>

    AND STARVING WOULD BECOME
         THE NEW BLACK.

     BUT I'M NOT HERE TODAY
TO PAT US ALL ON THE BACK.

            I'M HERE
      TO SPEAK OF PLAN Bs.

              Mike:
     <i>AS ANDY BEGAN OUTLINING</i>

      <i>EXXON'S TOUGH SOLUTION</i>
     <i>TO CLIMATE CHANGE,</i>

     <i>10 VOLUNTEERS PASSED OUT</i>

     <i>300 HUMAN FLESH CANDLES.</i>

       <i>THIS VIGIL WOULD BE</i>
          <i>LIKE NO OTHER.</i>

     WHO FIRST HAD THE IDEA

         TO USE THE OIL
OF A RECENTLY-LIVING ANIMAL

             <i>TO LIGHT</i>
     <i>HIS OR HER HOUSE?</i>

           <i>EVEN TODAY,</i>
     <i>SHETLAND ISLANDERS</i>

          <i>CUT THE HEADS</i>
     <i>OFF THEIR PUFFINS</i>

          <i>AND PUT WICKS</i>
          <i>IN THE STUMPS</i>
         <i>TO MAKE CANDLES.</i>

WE AT EXXON FIRMLY BELIEVE

    THAT A FREE MARKET WILL,
IF LEFT TO ITS OWN DEVICES,

      <i>ALWAYS FINDS SOLUTIONS</i>
         <i>TO THE DILEMMAS</i>

       <i>THAT HUMANITY FACES.</i>

        WE'RE CALLING OUR
    NEW TECHNOLOGY VIVOLEUM.

              Mike:
 <i>AS ANDY BEGAN TO DESCRIBE</i>
       <i>EXXON'S NEW BIOFUEL,</i>

      <i>THE CANDLES WERE LIT.</i>
       <i>A STRANGE ODOR ROSE</i>
          <i>INTO THE AIR.</i>

WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS
AN ARTIST'S RENDITION

OF AN ADVANCED
LARGE-SCALE PLANT,

 <i>THE VIVOLEUM FEED STOCK</i>
 <i>IS RENEWABLE, UNPRECIOUS</i>

 <i>AND RESPONDS TO THE NEED</i>
 <i>OF A SHRINKING MARKET</i>

 <i>WITH GREATER SUPPLY.</i>
 <i>THE DANCE OF CAPITAL</i>
 <i>APPEARS IN FULL FLOWER.</i>

              Mike:
       <i>FINALLY IT WAS TIME</i>
 <i>TO INTRODUCE REGGIE WATTS,</i>

     <i>THE DYING EXXON JANITOR</i>

       <i>WHO HAD VOLUNTEERED</i>
     <i>TO BE TURNED INTO FUEL.</i>

AND NOW WE BEGIN
THE TRIBUTE VIDEO
TO REGGIE WATTS.

     I WORKED IN MAINTENANCE
          FOR A WHILE.

  I MOVED UP TO MAINTENANCE 2.
I STARTED DOING CLEAN-UP--

      <i>toxic spill clean-up.</i>

          AFTER I HEARD
         FROM THE DOCTOR
      THAT I WAS GONNA DIE,

     <i>I felt like I had</i>
      <i>something to live for.</i>

        ( man speaking )

        I THINK I'D LIKE
        TO BE A CANDLE.

       <i>There's just so many</i>
     <i>uses for a candle.</i>

    I MEAN, LIKE IF YOU WANT
    SOMETHING ROMANTIC,

LIKE THAT'D BE NICE TO KNOW
I WAS A CANDLE ON A TABLE.

     YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE--
 WHEN THEY FIRST MET EACH OTHER

        ON A DATE.
    I THINK THAT'D BE GREAT.

 <i>THIS IS A FUNERARY OBSERVANCE.</i>
     <i>I MEAN, THIS GUY DIED.</i>

 - SWITCH THIS OFF BEFORE I DO.
 - THIS MAN DIED!

         "IT'S PEOPLE."
        ( laughs )

          IT REALLY IS.

        HOW IS IT?

      THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
        GENTLEMEN.

      THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

              Mike:
         <i>I'M VERY SORRY,</i>
     <i>BUT WE'VE BEEN CUT OFF.</i>

APPARENTLY WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO HAVE A FUNERARY OBSERVANCE

FOR A MAN WHO'S DIED
TO MAKE A PRODUCT POSSIBLE.

AND I'M-- I'M BEING--
WHY-- ARE YOU ALLOWED
TO DO THAT TO ME?

I-- WHAT--

<i>( scattered applause )</i>
Man: <i>GOOD JOB.</i>

    THE REMAINING 20 IS JUST,
    YOU KNOW, BINDERS--

         BONDERS TO KEEP
          IT TOGETHER.

    WE HAVE TO THINK--

    - COME WITH US, PLEASE.
    - SURE.

      - WOW.
      - Man: <i>BOY, OH BOY.</i>

          ( chatting )

NOW!
THANK YOU.

        - HEY.
        - SHUT IT DOWN.

    - DON'T TOUCH MY CAMERA.
    - SHUT IT DOWN.

     <i>NOW.</i>

              Mike:
       <i>HAD WE ACTUALLY MADE</i>
          <i>THE OIL PEOPLE</i>

         <i>THINK ABOUT WHAT</i>
         <i>THEY WERE DOING?</i>

       <i>IT WAS HARD TO TELL.</i>

      <i>AND THERE WASN'T MUCH</i>
   <i>TIME LEFT TO FIGURE IT OUT.</i>

       <i>BIG OIL WAS ALREADY</i>
      <i>DESTROYING THE PLANET,</i>

         <i>AND NOT JUST BY</i>
   <i>SPEEDING UP CLIMATE CHANGE.</i>

     THIS HOUSE RIGHT HERE,
     IT USED TO BE ON THIS SIDE.

      - YEAH, BUT WHERE?
      - IT WAS OVER HERE.

            IT MOVED OVER THERE.
            I COULD ONLY TAKE IT
            TWO OR THREE DAYS

               <i>A WEEK COMING</i>
               <i>DOWN HERE TO WORK</i>

          <i>AND THIS YEAR</i>
          <i>FOR HUNTING SEASON,</i>
          <i>I DIDN'T KILL NOTHING.</i>

         <i>I JUST WASN'T</i>
         <i>IN THE MOOD TO KILL.</i>

    AND I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING
    ELSE THAT WAS DEAD.

    JUST WASN'T IN THE MOOD.
        I MEAN, YOU KNOW.

NOT THAT I'M A BIG KILLER,
BUT I LIKE KILLING STUFF.

         - YEAH.
         - ( laughing )

    IT'S REALLY JUST AMAZING.
     WHEN YOU GO DOWNRIVER,

    SOME OF THE PONDS WE USED
    TO FISH IN ARE NOW ALMOST
        LIKE A BAY.

              Mike:
 <i>FOR DECADES, THE GOVERNMENT HAD</i>
   <i>IGNORED SCIENTISTS' WARNINGS</i>

 <i>AND LET INDUSTRY CARVE UP</i>
           <i>THE WETLANDS</i>

          <i>THAT PROTECTED</i>
     <i>NEW ORLEANS FROM STORMS.</i>

           Mark Davis:
         <i>ABOUT A MILLION</i>
          <i>ACRES OF LAND</i>

         <i>HAS DISAPPEARED</i>
           <i>SINCE 1930.</i>

IT WAS DONE CANAL BY CANAL,
     OIL FIELD BY OIL FIELD,

          PORT BY PORT,
        PARCEL BY PARCEL.

            IT WAS, IF YOU WILL,
            DEATH BY 1,000 CUTS.

         THE GOVERNING MINDSET,
         CULTURALLY AND LEGALLY,

       <i>WAS IF THERE'S AN IMPACT,</i>
       <i>WE'LL DEAL WITH IT LATER.</i>

        AND IN SOME WAYS
        THIS IS A PREVIEW

OF WHAT THE REST OF THIS COUNTRY
    AND THE REST OF THE WORLD
     HAVE IN STORE FOR THEM.

         <i>( wind roaring )</i>

              Mike:
     <i>WHEN KATRINA HIT,</i>

 <i>THE WETLANDS WEREN'T THERE</i>
      <i>TO DIMINISH ITS FORCE</i>

      <i>AND THE LEVEES DIDN'T</i>
         <i>STAND A CHANCE.</i>

       <i>SO THE REAL CULPRIT</i>
       <i>FOR THE DESTRUCTION</i>
          <i>OF NEW ORLEANS</i>

           <i>WASN'T JUST</i>
         <i>A BIG HURRICANE,</i>

       <i>BUT GREED DRESSED UP</i>
           <i>AS PROGRESS.</i>

  WHAT PRODUCED THIS TREMENDOUS
IMPROVEMENT IN TECHNOLOGY?

      IT WAS SELF-INTEREST
OR, IF YOU PREFER, GREED--

     THE GREED OF PRODUCERS
 WHO WANTED TO PRODUCE SOMETHING

         THAT THEY COULD
        MAKE A DOLLAR ON.

              Mike:
         <i>GREED HAD CAUSED</i>

     <i>THE BIGGEST CATASTROPHE</i>
       <i>EVER TO HIT THE U.S.</i>

      <i>AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT</i>
         <i>WAS HANDING OUT</i>

       <i>BILLIONS OF DOLLARS</i>
     <i>IN REBUILDING CONTRACTS.</i>

         <i>IN OTHER WORDS,</i>
       <i>LETTING GREED SOLVE</i>
           <i>THE PROBLEM.</i>

         THERE HAS BEEN
      THIS IDEA THAT IT IS
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY

TO REPLAN THE CONSTRUCTION
         OF NEW ORLEANS.

     <i>IT'S BETTER TO LEAVE IT</i>
          <i>TO THE MARKET.</i>

              Mike:
 <i>WE WANTED TO TAKE A CLOSER</i>
      <i>LOOK AT HOW THE MARKET</i>

         <i>WAS FIXING</i>
       <i>THE U.S. GULF COAST.</i>

        WE'RE ON OUR WAY
        TO THE GULF COAST
    RECONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE

    AT THE WASHINGTON
    CONVENTION CENTER.

     WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO
    A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

          WHO ARE BUSY
RECONSTRUCTING NEW ORLEANS.

    - <i>( honks )</i>
    - YEAH, WATCH OUT.

  THERE ARE MANY SILVER-LININGS
  TO THIS HORRENDOUS DISASTER,

       <i>AND WITH IT HAS COME</i>
 <i>AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.</i>

    I'M OPTIMISTIC WHEN I SEE
    A ROOMFUL OF FOLKS

WHO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
      OF THE OPPORTUNITIES.

     AND THAT'S A GOOD THING
      FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE.

    IT'S A GREAT THING.

WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE THE ISRAELIS SAY:

ONCE IN A WHILE
A GOOD CRISIS IS NOT BAD;

 <i>YOU COME UP</i>
 <i>WITH NEW THINGS.</i>

              Mike:
       <i>WE WERE SEEING A LOT</i>
          <i>OF NEW THINGS.</i>

     <i>BUT WASN'T THIS SUPPOSED</i>
      <i>TO BE ABOUT GULF COAST</i>
         <i>RECONSTRUCTION?</i>

WE'RE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED
IN GULF COAST RECONSTRUCTION.

         AND, UH, IS THIS--
         DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING
         TO DO WITH THAT?

THIS IS FOR BOMB DETONATION

AND AMMUNITION STORAGE.

          PERIMETER
          AND PHYSICAL SECURITY,

              MAINLY ANTI-RAM
              ROADBLOCKERS.

             Woman:
   <i>THIS PARTICULAR UNIT CAN BE</i>
  <i>USED IN MILITARY APPLICATIONS.</i>

            WOW.  SO IT'S A REAL
            CATASTROPHE TOILET,
            BASICALLY.

              Mike:
  <i>ALL THIS STUFF WOULD BE GREAT</i>
  <i>FOR THE PEOPLE OF NEW ORLEANS</i>

     <i>IF THEY WERE GONNA</i>
           <i>FIGHT A WAR.</i>

       <i>WHERE WAS THE STUFF</i>
      <i>ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE?</i>

    - <i>( Middle-Eastern</i>
     <i> music playing )</i>
    - <i>AH, HERE IT WAS.</i>

           <i>THE PAVILION</i>
     <i>FROM CENTRAL ASIA.</i>

             KYRGYZ'S PEOPLE ARE
             READY TO HELP

        THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA,
        MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA.

         <i>BY ERECTING YURTS</i>
         <i>THERE FOR THEM AS</i>
         <i>A TEMPORARY SHELTER.</i>

AND HERE'S THE YURT.

          - OH MY GOSH.
          - THIS IS IT.

YOU CAN COVER IT UP.
YOU CAN BUILD A FIRE--
YOU CAN OPEN IT UP.

AND IF THERE'S A FLOOD,
YOU CAN JUST TAKE IT UP
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

THEY'RE INTERESTED IN SENDING
  ONE FREE OF CHARGE...
GREAT.

  - ...TO LOUISIANA AS A TEST
    IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.
  - THANK YOU.

             - YEP.
              - NO!

              Mike:
  <i>THE YURT WAS THE ONLY SOLUTION</i>
 <i>HERE ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE.</i>

     <i>BUT THE GOVERNMENT REPS</i>
   <i>DIDN'T SEEM VERY INTERESTED.</i>

         <i>THERE'S NO MONEY</i>
         <i>IN YURTS.</i>

 <i>WE DECIDED WE COULD OUTDO</i>
   <i>EVERYONE AT THIS CONFERENCE</i>

     <i>AND BEAT THE FREE MARKET</i>
         <i>AT ITS OWN GAME.</i>

   <i>WE WOULD INVENT THE ULTIMATE</i>
       <i>DISASTER TECHNOLOGY:</i>

 <i>A DEVICE SO SOPHISTICATED</i>

     <i>IT COULD PROTECT ANYONE</i>
 <i>FROM PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.</i>

 <i>BUT IT WOULD COST SO MUCH</i>

      <i>THAT ONLY THE RICHEST</i>
   <i>BUSINESSMEN COULD AFFORD IT.</i>

      - THEY KIND OF
        JUST FLATTEN OUT.
      - YEAH.

      <i>THE ONLY QUESTION WAS,</i>
     <i>WHAT COMPANY WOULD MAKE</i>
          <i>SUCH A THING?</i>

       Newsreel announcer:
       <i>You've got to think</i>
           <i>Halliburton.</i>

              Man:
      <i>For they are the ones</i>
       <i>who do the research</i>

         <i>to make the mud</i>
     <i>to build the tool</i>

     <i>to run in the well</i>
         <i>to make the test</i>

         <i>to log the zone</i>
       <i>to set the packers,</i>

         <i>cement the pipe</i>
     <i>and fire the gun,</i>

          <i>to perforate,</i>
         <i>to pump the gel</i>
      <i>that carries the sand</i>

      <i>that props the frac, </i>
      <i>completes the well to</i>
     <i>produce the crude</i>

       <i>that runs the world</i>
     <i>for all the people</i>
     <i>all over the earth</i>

      <i>who live in the house</i>
         <i>that oil built.</i>

              Mike:
       <i>HALLIBURTON HAS BEEN</i>
         <i>THE WORLD LEADER</i>

       <i>IN EXTRACTING PROFIT</i>
   <i>FROM EVERY KIND OF DISASTER.</i>

      <i>THEY MADE BILLIONS OFF</i>
     <i>THE FIRST GULF WAR</i>

         <i>AND ITS SEQUEL,</i>
     <i>AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS</i>
          <i>OFF KATRINA--</i>

           <i>ALL PAID FOR</i>
     <i>BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,</i>

     <i>WHOSE VICE PRESIDENT WAS</i>
      <i>ONCE THEIR OWN C.E.O..</i>

         <i>IF ANYONE COULD</i>
         <i>MAKE A KILLING </i>
       <i>FROM TOTAL DISASTER,</i>

     <i>HALLIBURTON WOULD</i>
           <i>BE THE ONE.</i>

THIS MORNING WE GOT UP
REALLY EARLY,

DROVE UP
TO THE VERY FANCY HOTEL

WHICH SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS
BECAUSE THEY THREATENED US

IF WE USE THE MATERIAL...

( laughs )
WITH THEIR NAME.

BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT--
WHAT'S IT CALLED,
BASICALLY, THE HOTEL?

RITZ-CARLTON.
<i>RITZ-CARLTON, THAT ONE.</i>

     - HOW ARE YOU DOING?
     - I'M NORTHROP GOODY.

      I'M HERE WITH HALLIBURTON,
      WITH FRED WOLF.

                I'M JUST HELPING
                DEMO A PRODUCT.

                 <i>WOULD EITHER</i>
                 <i>ONE OF YOU MIND</i>

          <i>HELPING US</i>
          <i>DEMO THE SUITS?</i>
          <i>WE HAVE THREE OF THEM.</i>

     SO YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY
    STEP INTO IT, PULL IT ON.

IT'S KIND OF LIKE A COVERALL.
I'LL WEAR IT.

    - YOU'LL WEAR IT?
      ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
    - I'LL WEAR IT.

     - NO PROBLEM.
     - YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT.

 - YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD SPORT.
 - NO PROBLEM.

              Mike:
      <i>THE CATASTROPHIC LOSS</i>
         <i>CONFERENCE</i>

 <i>WAS FOR INSURANCE PEOPLE.</i>
     <i>THEY KNEW NUMBER</i>

     <i>AND WE WERE ABOUT</i>
     <i>TO SHOW THEM SOME</i>
       <i>PRETTY SIMPLE MATH.</i>

           <i>WITH GILDA,</i>
     <i>WE'D TRIED SCARY.</i>

           <i>WITH REGGIE,</i>
         <i>WE TRIED GROSS.</i>

         <i>NOW WE WOULD GO</i>
         <i>FOR RIDICULOUS.</i>

    UH, WE REALLY APPRECIATE
     BEING INVITED TO SPEAK
         ON THIS PANEL.

      UM, A LOT OF YOU WORK
  WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY,
        OF COURSE.

      INSURANCE HAS BECOME
        EXTREMELY WORRIED

        ABOUT SOME GRAVE
      NEW DANGERS TO PEOPLE

 THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE WORLD
        AROUND US TODAY.

    AND I'M OF COURSE TALKING
      ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE

        AND THE DISASTERS
         THAT IT BRINGS.

      BUT I CAN PERSONALLY
          GUARANTEE YOU

  THAT LEVEL HEADS WILL ALWAYS
     BE ABLE TO TURN LEMONS

         INTO LEMONADE.

CONSIDER THE BLACK PLAGUE.

     <i>THIS WAS AN UNSPEAKABLY </i>
     <i>ROTTEN EVENT, OF COURSE,</i>

    IN WHICH ONE-THIRD
     OF EUROPE'S POPULATION
      DIED IN GREAT AGONY.

    NO ONE, OF COURSE,
     WOULD WISH SUCH A THING
      ON ANY CIVILIZATION.

        YET WITHOUT IT--
WITHOUT THE BLACK PLAGUE--

     THE OLD BUSINESS MODELS
OF EUROPE WOULD NEVER HAVE
         BEEN OVERTURNED

      BY THE ENTREPRENEURS
      OF THE RENAISSANCE.

   <i>AND WHAT WOULD THE WORLD BE</i>
      <i>WITHOUT THE MONA LISA?</i>

    OR CLOSER TO HOME,

            HOW ABOUT
        THE GREAT DELUGE?

  THIS WORLD-ENDING DISASTER--
        LITERALLY--

    WAS SURELY SEEN AS
     A TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE
    BY NOAH'S CONTEMPORARIES,

        AND PERHAPS
        BY NOAH HIMSELF.

    YET NOAH WAS READY
    TO SEIZE THE DAY.

AND AT THE END OF THAT DAY,
    NOT ONLY WAS THERE
    A WHOLE NEW WORLD,

     BUT NOAH FOUND HIMSELF
 WITH A MONOPOLY OF THE ANIMALS.

  FOR THOSE OF US IN POSITIONS
  OF RESPONSIBILITY, HOWEVER,

     WHO MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE
    CHARGE IN A CRISIS,

  <i>EVEN MORE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS</i>
          <i>ARE NECESSARY.</i>

           <i>I'D LIKE NOW</i>
 <i>TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUE,</i>
       <i>DR. NORTHROP GOODY,</i>

      <i>WHO'S THE HEAD OF OUR</i>
     <i>EMERGENCY PRODUCTS</i>

         <i>DEVELOPMENT UNIT</i>
         <i>AT HALLIBURTON. </i>

      <i>AND DR. GOODY WILL BE</i>
      <i>SHOWING SOME MOCK-UPS</i>

<i>OF SOME ITEMS THAT</i>
 <i> HIS UNIT HAS DEVELOPED.</i>
<i>( applause )</i>

WE WANT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING
TO BE ABLE TO SAVE A HUMAN BEING

  NO MATTER WHAT MOTHER NATURE
         THROWS AT HIM.

AND SO THIS IS THE ANSWER.

     <i>THIS IS THE HALLIBURTON</i>
           <i>SURVIVABALL.</i>

      IT'S THREE EASY STEPS
FOR DEPLOYMENT: SUITING UP,

         <i>INFLATING</i>
 <i>AND OF COURSE LAUNCHING--</i>

          LAUNCHING OUT
OF A BUILDING. AND WE HAVE
      AN ARTIST'S RENDITION

 <i>OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE </i>
 <i>IN HOUSTON WHEN WE LAUNCH</i>
     <i>OUR SURVIVABALLS.</i>

          IN THE EVENT
     OF EXTREME CATASTROPHE,

         THERE MIGHT BE
    A SCARCITY OF RESOURCES.

     <i>IN THIS CASE, WE'VE GOT</i>
      <i>A SURVIVABALL HERE...</i>

  - ( moos )
  - ...THAT'S GOING UP
    AND EXTRACTING RESOURCES,

          IN THIS CASE,
         FROM AN ANIMAL.

       <i>YOU DON'T WANT TO BE</i>
     <i>EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS,</i>

  <i>BUT YOU STILL WANT TO BE ABLE</i>
       <i>TO EXTRACT RESOURCES</i>

     <i>FROM, FOR EXAMPLE,</i>
              <i>A COW.</i>

     <i>THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE</i>
     <i>TO GO UNDERWATER,</i>

          <i>RATED AT 50'.</i>
         <i>THEY CAN BE USED</i>
     <i>IN ANY CONDITION.</i>

 <i>IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER</i>
      <i>YOU'RE IN A LANDSLIDE</i>
          <i>IN CALIFORNIA</i>

      <i>OR EVEN IN THE ARCTIC.</i>
 <i>OF COURSE ANY OTHER CONDITIONS,</i>

      <i>WHETHER IT'S TSUNAMIS</i>
          <i>OR TORNADOES,</i>

    THE SURVIVABALL IS
     DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND.

     <i>BUT THE BEST PART </i>
     <i>OF THE SURVIVABALL</i>

          <i>IS THAT PEOPLE</i>
           <i>NEED PEOPLE.</i>

  <i>AND SO OUR BIGGEST INSPIRATION</i>
   <i>FOR THE WAY THAT A COMMUNITY</i>
           <i>SHOULD WORK</i>

     <i>WITH SURVIVABALLS</i>
       <i>COMES FROM BIOLOGY.</i>

    UM, AS SOME OF YOU
          PROBABLY KNOW

     AMOEBAS GATHER TOGETHER
 AND ACTUALLY FORM ANOTHER BODY.

         THEY AGGREGATE.
     AND SO THESE ONE-CELLED
            ORGANISMS

          COME TOGETHER
        AS A SINGLE BODY.

          FOR EXAMPLE,
     HERE'S A RAFT FORMATION

         <i>OF SURVIVABALLS</i>
     <i>IN THE OCEAN-- FLOATING,</i>

          <i>COMMUNICATING,</i>
      <i>EXCHANGING NUTRIENTS,</i>

    DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTION.
          LAST OF ALL,

   <i>THIS IS LITERALLY THOUSANDS</i>
         <i>OF SURVIVABALLS</i>

         <i>DANCING THROUGH</i>
           <i>THE STREETS.</i>

          ( applause )

     <i>AND WE'LL BE HAPPY</i>
      <i>TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS</i>

         <i>SO IF THERE ARE</i>

     <i>ANY MORE TECHNICAL ONES</i>
     <i>FOR NORTHROP HERE</i>

         <i>OR GENERAL ONES.</i>

                         <i>YEP.</i>

    IF YOU COULD DEMONSTRATE
    THE TURTLE POSITION, PLEASE,
    THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

              BASICALLY
              IF YOU DUCK DOWN--

            YEAH, A VISOR,
            HEADS-UP DISPLAY,
            THE WHOLE THING.

         - YEAH.
         - WELL, YEAH.

            HI.

     - NORTHROP.
     - CAREY.  HOW ARE YOU?

             IT DOES.
             THAT'S IT.

MUCH MORE SO
THAN KATRINA.

              YEAH.
      YEAH, WELL, I MEAN...

              Mike:
      <i>WE'D DONE ALL WE COULD</i>
       <i>TO SHOW THESE PEOPLE</i>

           <i>WHAT SUCKED</i>
       <i>ABOUT LETTING GREED</i>
     <i>RUN OUR FUTURE...</i>

    - OH DEAR.
    - <i>...BUT INSTEAD</i>
     <i> OF FREAKING OUT,</i>

          <i>THEY JUST TOOK</i>
       <i>OUR BUSINESS CARDS.</i>

HELLO.  WONDERFUL.
AND IF YOU WANT TO TAKE
ONE OF MINE HERE?

       <i>OUR EFFORT HAD BEEN</i>
         <i>A FAILURE.</i>

IT'S NOT VERY
WELL ARTICULATED, REALLY.

     <i>AND COME TO THINK OF IT,</i>
     <i>ALL OF OUR EFFORTS</i>
     <i>HAD BEEN FAILURES.</i>

   <i>( orchestra music playing )</i>

          <i>BUT YOU KNOW,</i>
 <i>A YES MAN NEVER GIVES UP.</i>

     <i>WE KNEW WE COULD DO IT.</i>

     <i>ALL WE NEEDED WAS</i>
      <i>A WHOLE NEW APPROACH.</i>

 <i>MAYBE MAKING FUN OF STUPID</i>
     <i>IDEAS WAS A STUPID IDEA.</i>

       <i>WE HAD TO GET SMART,</i>
     <i>BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WITH</i>
     <i>THE REALLY STUPID IDEAS</i>

      <i>WERE VERY VERY SMART.</i>

           <i>FOR FRIEDMAN</i>
     <i>AND HIS FOLLOWERS,</i>

      <i>DISASTER WAS NOT JUST</i>
      <i>A CHANCE TO GET RICH,</i>

     <i>BUT AN OPPORTUNITY</i>
         <i>TO PUSH THROUGH</i>

         <i>ALL KINDS</i>
      <i>OF UNPOPULAR POLICIES,</i>

         <i>LIKE PRIVATIZING</i>
         <i>PUBLIC SCHOOLS,</i>

          <i>SHUTTING DOWN</i>
     <i>PUBLIC HOSPITALS,</i>

       <i>AND KICKING PEOPLE </i>
       <i>OUT OF THEIR HOMES.</i>

       <i>THIS IS THE LAFITTE</i>
         <i>HOUSING PROJECT.</i>

   <i>IT SURVIVED KATRINA INTACT.</i>

     <i>THAT WAS LUCKY FOR</i>
 <i>THE THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS</i>

     <i>WHO WANTED TO COME HOME</i>
           <i>AND REBUILD.</i>

           <i>SO WHAT DID</i>
     <i>THE GOVERNMENT DO?</i>

           <i>THEY DECIDED</i>
         <i>TO TEAR IT DOWN.</i>

THE DISASTER FOR US
STARTED AFTER THE STORM...

UH-HUH.
...WHEN PEOPLE FOUND OUT THAT
  YOU WERE GONNA BE MAROONED

 <i>IN A STRANGE FOREIGN CITY,</i>

 <i>WANTING TO COME HOME,</i>

AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING
TO TAKE YOUR HOME AWAY.

 THIS WAS OURS BEFORE THE STORM.
     AND WHEN STORMS HAPPEN
        EVERYWHERE ELSE,

    PEOPLE GET A CHANCE TO GO
 BACK HOME-- THIS IS HOME TO US.

 WHY DO THEY TAKE AWAY OUR PRIDE
 AND JOY?  THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
    PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH.

          Wade Rathke:
       <i>THERE'S A WHOLE CITY</i>
       <i>THAT'S WASHED AWAY. </i>

     <i>NOW YOU'VE GOTTA REBUILD</i>
         <i>THE WHOLE THING.</i>

      PART OF WHAT THIS WAS
WAS IF YOU EVER HAD AN IDEA

  THAT YOU COULDN'T GET THROUGH
        BEFORE THE STORM,

WELL, THE STORM MEANT THAT
  EVERYTHING WAS TOSSED SALAD.

    SO IF THIS IDEA HAD BEEN
  ROUNDLY REJECTED BY THE CITY

          AND BY VOTERS
          AND WHATEVER,

      <i>BUT NOW'S YOUR CHANCE</i>
         <i>TO SNEAK ON IN.</i>

              Mike:
       <i>WHEN RESIDENTS TRIED</i>
   <i>TO COME HOME AFTER KATRINA,</i>

      <i>THEY FOUND THEMSELVES</i>
     <i>LOCKED OUT BY HUD,</i>

     <i>THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S</i>
     <i>DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING</i>
     <i>AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT.</i>

         Pres Kabacoff:
      <i>THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</i>
      <i>CAME UP WITH A PROGRAM</i>

          TO DISMANTLE
         PUBLIC HOUSING

        AND PRIVATIZE IT.

         <i>AND THAT'S</i>
     <i>WHAT WE'RE DOING.</i>

     <i>AND SO YOU'VE GOT</i>
   <i>TO DEVELOP A NICE COMMUNITY</i>

     SO THAT THE POOR HAVE
     AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE
        IN AN ENVIRONMENT

    WHERE PEOPLE WORK,
      THAT THEY'RE PART OF
      THE AMERICAN DREAM.

          <i>AND YOU'LL GET</i>
     <i>A NUMBER OF FOLKS</i>
       <i>THAT ARE NOT USED TO</i>

      THE TYPE OF LIFESTYLE
        THAT WE ALL LIVE,

      WHERE TRASH IS THROWN
          ON THE GROUND

         <i>OR CURSING OFF </i>
         <i>OF THE BALCONY.</i>

         THE IDEA REALLY IS
         TO PROVIDE ROLE MODELS,
         ESSENTIALLY,

    - FOR POOR FOLKS, RIGHT?
    - ABSOLUTELY.

              Mike:
          <i>ON THE B.B.C.,</i>
         <i>WE TRIED TO SHOW</i>

       <i>THAT COMPANIES COULD</i>
       <i>BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY. </i>

 <i>AND WE'D LEARNED THAT THEY</i>
             <i>COULDN'T</i>

   <i>UNTIL GOVERNMENT MADE RULES</i>
         <i>TO CONTROL THEM.</i>

          <i>YET EVEN HERE</i>
         <i>IN NEW ORLEANS,</i>

   <i>WHERE HELP WAS MOST NEEDED,</i>

   <i>GOVERNMENT WAS ALSO DRINKING</i>
 <i>THE FREE-MARKET KOOL-AID.</i>

          I BELIEVE IN
    A MARKET-DRIVEN PROCESS.

     ECONOMICS, CAPITALISM--

      IT'S GONNA TAKE OVER.

    AND THE MARKETPLACE
      IS POISED TO RESPOND.

              Mike:
     <i>SO THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T</i>
      <i>BELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT.</i>

 <i>WE KNEW WHAT WE HAD TO DO:</i>

         WE <i>WOULD BECOME</i>
         <i>THE GOVERNMENT.</i>

      <i>AND WE WOULD FIND OUT</i>
     <i>WHAT WOULD HAPPEN</i>

     <i>IF GOVERNMENT DID</i>
     <i>THE RIGHT THING. </i>

        WE ARE PREPARING
     TO GO TO THE GULF COAST
    RECONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE

 - AT THE PONTCHARTRAIN CENTER
   IN KENNER NEAR THE AIRPORT.
 - LET'S GO.

 - YOU SHOULDN'T DRIVE.
   SOMEBODY ELSE SHOULD DRIVE.
 - OKAY.

SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE SHOULD
BE SAYING WE ARE FACING
A STATE OF EMERGENCY.

I'M GOING TO SPEAK AS HUD,
     AS THE DEPUTY ASSISTANT

    OF SECRETARY OF HUD
      WHO COULDN'T MAKE IT,

    AND C.N.N. IS GOING
     TO BE COVERING IT VE.

              Mike:
         <i>THIS CONFERENCE </i>
         <i>WAS TAKING PLA</i>

     <i>ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY</i>
           <i>OF KATRINA.</i>

   <i>A THOUSAND CONTRACTORS WHO </i>
   <i>WERE REBUILDING NEW ORLEANS</i>
         <i>WOULD BE THERE.</i>

WHAT'S THAT?

OH MY GOD.

     MAYOR RAY NAGIN COMING
          IS A BIT MORE

        THAN WE EXPECTED
          WOULD HAPPEN.

              Mike:
 <i>WHEN WE HATCHED OUR SCHEME</i>

     <i>WE TOLD THIS GUY--</i>
 <i>THE CONFERENCE ORGANIZER--</i>

       <i>THAT WE REPRESENTED</i>
       <i>ALPHONSO JACKSON,</i>
       <i>THE HEAD OF HUD. </i>

   <i>WHEN THE MAYOR AND GOVERNOR</i>
      <i>FOUND OUT THAT JACKSON</i>
         <i>WOULD BE THERE,</i>

 <i>THEY HAD TO BE THERE TOO.</i>

           <i>ONCE AGAIN,</i>
       <i>THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER</i>
     <i>WOULDN'T SHOW UP,</i>

     <i>BUT HIS ASSISTANT WOULD.</i>

      <i>WOULD THE MAYOR NOTICE</i>
 <i>THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG?</i>

          <i>AND WHAT WOULD</i>
      <i>THE CONTRACTORS THINK</i>

         <i>OF HUD'S RADICAL</i>
 <i>NEW APPROACH TO PUBLIC HOUSING,</i>

      <i>AN APPROACH THAT COULD</i>
         <i>COST THEM MONEY</i>

     <i>AND EVEN PUT SOME</i>
      <i>OF THEM OUT OF A JOB?</i>

           <i>( applause )</i>

...OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT
OF HOUSING AND URBAN
DEVELOPMENT.

        SO IT'S AN HONOR
    TO SHARE THE STAGE

      WITH OUR TWO PARTNERS
          IN RECOVERY,

        WITH RENE OSWIN,
        REPRESENTING HUD,

WHO'S DEFINITELY ONE
OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT PARTNERS
IN THIS REBUILDING EFFORT,

AND MAYOR NAGIN OF NEW ORLEANS,
WHOSE CHALLENGES ARE ENORMOUS.

     AND I ALSO WANT TO STOP
         AND THANK RENE,

      WHO'S HERE FROM HUD.

HUD HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE
INCREDIBLE PARTNER WITH US.

  WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF DOING
SOME REALLY UNIQUE THINGS,

         SOMETHING THAT
WE COULD HAVE NEVER TACKLED
IN THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS,

      AND NOW WE ARE POISED
    AND POSITIONED TO ENHANCE

          <i>PUBLIC HOUSING</i>
   <i>IN THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS.</i>

      <i>YOU KNOW, THERE'S LOTS</i>
 <i>OF INFORMATION OUT THERE,</i>

           <i>THERE'S LOTS</i>
   <i>OF MISINFORMATION OUT THERE.</i>

        BUT I HAVE
      A FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF

    THAT TRUTH AND LIE CANNOT
     STAY IN THE SAME PLACE
        AT THE SAME TIME.

      REMINDS ME OF A STORY
          I ONCE HEARD.

   <i>TRUTH AND LIE WENT SWIMMING</i>
  <i>ONE DAY IN LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.</i>

    THEY WENT SKINNY-DIPPING,
SO THEY LAID THEIR CLOTHES
          ON THE BANKS.

     AND THEY WERE OUT THERE
HAVING A REALLY GOOD TIME.

   <i>BUT THEN LIE ALL OF A SUDDEN</i>
       <i>JUMPED OUT THE WATER</i>

     PUT TRUTH'S CLOTHES ON
    AND STARTED RUNNING DOWN
        ESPLANADE--

     ELYSIAN FIELDS AVENUE.

     TRUTH GOT OUT THE WATER
 AND STARTED RUNNING AFTER LIE.

    SO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
        WHAT YOU HAD WAS

    A WELL-DRESSED LIE BEING
     CHASED BY NAKED TRUTH.

           <i>( applause )</i>

          THAT'S QUITE
     A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW.

  NOTHING LIKE THAT TO MAKE YOU
      FEEL A BIT NAKED, EH?

    UH... DEAR FRIENDS,

  IT IS WITH THE GREATEST JOY
  THAT I ANNOUNCE TO YOU TODAY

    A BRAND-NEW DEPARTMENT OF
 HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT.

          EVERYTHING IS
         GOING TO CHANGE
      ABOUT THE WAY WE WORK

        AND THE CHANGE IS
    GOING TO START RIGHT HERE
      TODAY IN NEW ORLEANS.

            UNTIL LAST WEEK,
            OUR M.O. HERE AT HUD

      WAS TO TEAR DOWN PUBLIC
      HOUSING WHENEVER WE COULD.

                 LIKE MANY FOLKS
                 IN WASHINGTON,

         WE THOUGHT
         THE PROJECTS CAUSED
         CRIME AND UNEMPLOYMENT.

         WE WERE WRONG.

        WHEN WE TORE DOWN
ST. THOMAS AND REPLACED IT
    WITH MIXED-INCOME FLATS,

            ONLY ONE
     OF 27 FORMER RESIDENTS
    EVER MADE IT BACK.

     AND THE REST HAVE FACED
         MANY PROBLEMS,

          IN SOME CASES
    EVEN HOMELESSNESS.
      IT JUST DIDN'T WORK.

          WE WON'T MAKE
        THAT ERROR AGAIN.

         THIS AFTERNOON
         WE WILL BEGIN TO REOPEN

     ALL PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS
     IN NEW ORLEANS

      AND ALLOW
      THESE AMERICANS TO BE PART
      OF THEIR CITY ONCE AGAIN.

       <i>BUT OPENING DOORS--</i>

        THANK YOU.

        BUT OPENING DOORS
        WON'T BE ENOUGH.
          AS YOU KNOW,

  THE MAIN REASON NEW ORLEANS
  WAS SO VULNERABLE TO KATRINA

    WAS THE DESTRUCTION
        OF THE WETLANDS.

         I AM VERY VERY
    VERY PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE

      THAT EXXON AND SHELL
     HAVE AGREED TO FINANCE
    WETLANDS REBUILDING

  FROM PART OF THE $60 BILLION
      IN PROFITS THIS YEAR.

       <i>AS J. STEPHEN SIMON,</i>
  <i>EXN VICE PRESIDENT, WRITES,</i>

         "EXXON MOBIL IS
     EARMARKING $8.6 BILLION

 <i>FROM REVENUES OUR COMPANY</i>
     <i>HAS MADE IN THIS REGION,</i>

      SO AS TO ASSURE THAT
     EXXON MOBIL NEVER AGAIN

    HAS A HAND IN DESTROYING
    A LARGE AMERICAN CITY."

      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
    WE WILL REBUILD NOT
        JUST NEW ORLEANS,

         WE WILL REBUILD
    THE AMERICAN DREAM.

    PLEASE COME JOIN US
 AT THE LAFITTE HOUSING COMPLEX

      FOR A RIBBON-CUTTING
      CEREMONY IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE PLENARY SESSION.

          THIS IS WHAT
    WE'RE ALL HERE FOR,
    SO LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN.

        LET'S BRING
        NEW ORLEANS BACK.

              Man:
         <i>I THOUGHT IT WAS</i>
         <i>VERY UPLIFTING. </i>

  THIS HAS BEEN A BIG PROBLEM.
      A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT
          TO COME HOME

    AND THEY HAVE BEEN
        UNABLE TO DO SO,

    SO I THOUGHT IT WAS
    A VERY POSITIVE MESSAGE.

      OH, VERY ENCOURAGING.
  AND WHAT'S REALLY ENCOURAGING

    IN PARTICULAR IS NOT ONLY
    GETTING PEOPLE BACK HOME

    AND HELPING THEM REBUILD,
    BUT THE RECOGNITION

      THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL
      WITH MOTHER NATURE.

    AND THAT EXXON IS GOING
    TO MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT
          CONTRIBUTION

    TO RESTORE WETLANDS IS--
     IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING.

           <i>( applause )</i>

              Mike:
      <i>THIS WAS ENCOURAGING.</i>

 <i>WHEN THE CONTRACTORS HEARD</i>
       <i>THAT THE GOVERNMENT</i>

         <i>WAS GOING</i>
      <i>TO DO THE RIGHT THING,</i>

       <i>EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT</i>
     <i>COST THEM SOME BUSINESS,</i>

          <i>THEY CHEERED.</i>

       <i>FRIEDMAN WAS WRONG.</i>
     <i>GREED ALONE DIDN'T RULE</i>
         <i>THE WORLD.</i>

HI.
HI.  MY NAME'S STEVE STRADER,
  WITH W.W.L.

      - MIND IF I TALK
        TO YOU OVER HERE?
      - ABSOLUTELY.

     - DO YOU HAVE A CARD?
     - NO, NOT TODAY.

              Mike:
     <i>AND THIS TIME WE'D</i>
      <i>GOTTEN AWAY TH IT...</i>

 - ALL RIGHT, THANKS.  BYE-BYE.
 - <i>...OR SO WE THOUGHT.</i>

THE CITY AND THE STATE
BOTH SAY THEY'VE NOT HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS,

THAT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
COMES AS A SURPRISE TO
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

AND THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.
WHY WOULD HUD DO THIS

WITHOUT CONSULTING
THE CITY AND THE STATE?

WELL, IT'S SUCH A--
WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS
WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH THEM.

YOU HAVE NO CARDS.
YOU SAY YOU'RE NEW
TO THE AGENCY?

         I HAVE A CARD, BUT IT'S
         BACK AT THE OFFICE.

I'LL GET IT TO YOU.
WHERE IS YOUR P.R. TEAM?

  - Mike: <i>I'M RIGHT HERE, HI.</i>
  - UM... THERE.

     - HI, YOU'RE WITH HUD?
     - YES, I AM.

    - DO YOU HAVE A CARD?
    - THERE'S AN ENTIRE HUD
      HOUSING PROJECT THERE

    - LEFT UNFINISHED.
    - YEAH.

      THERE ARE SOME SAYING
      THAT THIS IS A FARCE,

      THAT YOU'RE NOT TRULY
    WITH HUD AND THAT THIS IS
NOT AN ACTUAL ANNOUNCEMENT.

        WELL, THEY CAN SAY
        WHATEVER THEY WANT.
        WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

    - WHERE IS YOUR OFFICE?
    - IN WASHINGTON.

      WHERE IN WASHINGTON.

HE DID JUST-- HE JUST
JOINED THE AGENCY
FROM FRANCE.

         - HE'S A--
         - FROM FRANCE?

YEAH, HE'S BEEN
A SPECIAL ATTACHE

TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF THE INTERIOR IN FRANCE.

                WHY ARE YOU
                SO SKEPTICAL?

    WE JUST HEARD THE SPEECH
      AND I HAVE A NEWSCAST
          VERY SHORTLY.

        I NEED TO CONFIRM
            IF IT WAS

          A REAL SPEECH
        FROM HUD OR NOT.

THE GOVERNOR AND THE MAYOR
    KNEW NOTHING OF IT.
    THEY WERE SHOCKED.

     WE DESPERATELY NEED TO KNOW
     IF THIS IS REAL OR NOT.

     HE'S STANDING RIGHT HERE,
     THE MAN WHO JUST APPARENTLY

             COMMITTED THIS HOAX
             ON YOUR DEPARTMENT.

     I'M ON THE PHONE
     WITH HUD RIGHT NOW
     AND THEY SAY YOU'RE A LIAR.

    OKAY, WELL, THEY CAN SAY
    WHATEVER THEY WANT.

     - I'M SORRY.
     - THEY CAN SAY
       WHATEVER THEY LIKE.

          "THEY CAN SAY
          WHATEVER THEY LIKE."
          BUT YOU WORK FOR THEM

    - DON'T YOU,
      AS A DEPUTY SECRETARY?
    - THAT'S RIGHT.

NOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN
DISCOVERED, DO YOU WANT TO
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU DID IT?

                IF YOU'RE TRYING
                TO MAKE A POINT,
                WHY DON'T YOU

                COME OVER HERE
                AND TELL ME WHY
                YOU DID THIS?

            ALL RIGHT, MAN.
            I'LL CALL YOU
            IN A FEW MINUTES.

              BUT IT IS A HOAX--
              A MASSIVE HOAX
              PERPETRATED TODAY.

     - YOU JUST PULLED OFF
       A HECK OF A HOAX.
     - THANK YOU.

IT-- I MEAN, I WOULD
SAY THAT, YOU KNOW,

HUD IS PULLING OFF
A HOAX BY PRETENDING THAT

TEARING DOWN AFFORDABLE HOUSING
IS WHAT'S GONNA SOLVE IT.

I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
THEY'VE BEEN DOING UNTIL NOW.

THIS IS A TIME WHEN
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE
CLAMORING TO GET BACK IN.

THEY WANT TO GET BACK
INTO THEIR HOUSING AND
THEY DESERVE TO BE THERE.

        IT'S CRAZY.

     - AND WORTH LYING
       TO ALL THESE PEOPLE?
     - OH, ABSOLUTELY.

ABSOLUTELY.
ACTUALLY TELLING THE TRUTH.

THIS IS ACTUALLY TRUTH-TELLING
WHERE NORMALLY THERE
WOULD ONLY BE LIES.

      <i>( jazz band playing )</i>

HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE
TO REMEDIATE WHAT YOU
SEE HERE TODAY

AND MAKE IT INHABITABLE,
SAY, NEXT WEEK?

    JUST TAKE OFF THE--
    TAKE OFF THE COVERS HERE.

OH YEAH, THAT'S
A GOOD START, YEAH?

         - ABSOLUTELY.
         - THAT'S IT.

             FINALLY
      WE WILL BE REOPENING

         PUBLIC HOUSING
    FOR THE RESIDENTS--

        FOR THE WORKFORCE
  THAT'S GOING TO MOVE BACK IN

        AND AGAIN REBUILD
          NEW ORLEANS.

     Sick, twisted, cruel--

    those are all words used
      to describe the prank

     on Louisiana officials
and about 1,000 contractors

      in New Orleans today.

        I'm deputy
      assistant secretary,

     to-- of the assistant,

    essentially, of Secretary
        Alphonso Jackson.

            Reporter:
  <i>Rene Oswin can't get his title</i>
 <i>right or his relationship</i>

     <i>to HUD secretary </i>
     <i>Alphonso Jackson.</i>

          ( cheering )

           <i>After taking</i>
      <i>the mayor for a ride,</i>

  <i>these contractors followed him</i>
  <i>to a makeshift ribbon cutting</i>

          <i>at the Lafitte</i>
         <i>Housing Project.</i>

Mr. Oswin, you're not even
on the directory of HUD.

You're not even listed--
don't have a phone number.

              It's come to that,
              has it?

        It's come to that.
        Thanks for being the one
        to break the news.

        HANO, the Housing
    Authority of New Orleans

    says this is simply
    a cruel cruel joke,

      trying to give people
     some kind of fake hope

that they were going to be
    able to move back.

         <i>( man speaking )</i>

            ...THIS WHOLE
            PRESS CONFERENCE.

        I GUESS IT'S JUST
    TO CALL THEIR HAND.

      I RESPECT THIS HOAX,
    BECAUSE MAYBE IT'LL TAKE
        A HOAX LIKE THIS

     TO BRING THEM OUT HERE
        TO SEE WHAT WE'RE
         GOING THROUGH.

SO IF THE HOAX WHAT IT BE,
     A HOAX IS WHAT WE GOT.

        AND I AIN'T MAD.
        I'M GRABBING ME
         SOME BARBECUE.

            Juakali:
           <i>I THINK WHAT</i>
         <i>YOU GUYS EXPOSED</i>

      IS THE FACT THAT HUD
COULD DO THESE GREAT THINGS

    IF THEY WANTED TO.

        SECONDLY, YOU GOT
 THE ATTENTION OF THE RESIDENTS

      SO NOW THEY'RE GONNA
          BEGIN TO ASK,

      <i>"WELL, WHY AREN'T YOU</i>
      <i>DOING THESE THINGS?" </i>

     <i>AND NUMBER THREE,</i>
  <i>YOU'RE CREATING A CONTROVERSY</i>

    TO FEED OFF, TO ORGANIZE
    AND TO BUILD A STRUGGLE

    TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

        SO IN MY OPINION,
      EVERYTHING Y'ALL DID

         WAS EXCELLENT.

              Mike:
   <i>IT HAD ALL BEEN WORTHWHILE.</i>

             <i>WE WERE</i>
       <i>ON TOP OF THE WORLD.</i>

      <i>BUT THEN REALITY BEGAN</i>
           <i>TO SINK IN.</i>

       <i>WE'D MADE A SPLASH,</i>

          <i>BUT WE HADN'T</i>
         <i>FIXED THE WORLD.</i>

 <i>THE FREE MARKET WAS STILL</i>
     <i>DESTROYING NEW ORLEANS.</i>

       <i>ALL OVER THE WORLD,</i>
 <i>PEOPLE WERE LOSING THEIR HOMES.</i>

       <i>CLIMATE CHANGE KEPT</i>
          <i>GETTING WORSE.</i>

          <i>AND IN BHOPAL,</i>
   <i>PEOPLE CONTINUED TO SUFFER.</i>

     <i>WE REALLY DID NEED</i>
     <i>TO FIX THE WORLD. </i>

      <i>BUT IT WAS GONNA TAKE</i>
     <i>MORE THAN TWO GUYS</i>

         <i>WITH CHEAP SUITS</i>
     <i>AND FAKE WEBSITES.</i>

          <i>IT WOULD TAKE</i>
         <i>MILLIONS OF US.</i>

     ( shouting in French )

              Mike:
     <i>BUT EVEN AS OLD REGIMES</i>
         <i>WERE SWEPT AWAY,</i>

     <i>WE KNEW THAT REAL CHANGE</i>
       <i>WOULDN'T COME EASY.</i>

         <i>AFTER ALL,</i>
       <i>THE FREE-MARKET CULT</i>
         <i>WAS STILL HERE.</i>

        - WEALTH.
        - MONEY.

        - PRIVATIZATION.
        - WEALTH.

         - MONEY.
         - FREE MARKETS.

        - PRIVATIZATION.
        - OWNERSHIP.

     A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.
     NOW WE CAN AFFORD THAT.

              Mike:
       <i>REMEMBER THESE GUYS?</i>

     <i>THEY'RE NOT GOING AWAY.</i>

      <i>AND NEITHER WOULD WE.</i>

     <i>WE NEEDED A REALLY</i>
         <i>AMBITIOUS PLAN,</i>

     <i>BECAUSE ALL WE EVER READ</i>
     <i>IN THE NEWSPAPERS</i>

     <i>WAS HOW WE NEEDED TO PUT</i>
 <i>EVERYTHING BACK ON TRACK,</i>

     <i>BACK TO HOW IT WAS</i>
      <i>BEFORE IT FELL APART.</i>

          <i>BUT HOW IT WAS</i>
         <i>WAS THE PROBLEM.</i>

      <i>WE NEEDED TO SHOW WHAT</i>
   <i>REAL CHANGE COULD LOOK LIKE.</i>

     <i>SO TOGETHER WITH A WHOLE</i>
         <i>LOT OF FRIENDS,</i>

 <i>WE WOULD BLANKET MANHATTAN</i>
       <i>WITH 100,000 COPIES</i>

 <i>OF OUR VERY OWN NEWSPAPER.</i>

           <i>WE'D CALL IT</i>
      <i>"THE NEW YORK TIMES."</i>

   <i>EXCEPT OUR "NEW YORK TIMES"</i>
      <i>WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT</i>
         <i>DIFFERENT.</i>

   <i>OURS WOULD BE SET SIX MONTHS</i>
          <i>IN THE FUTURE.</i>

     <i>IT WOULD SHOW WHAT</i>
           <i>COULD HAPPEN</i>

         <i>IF WE SET</i>
      <i>OUR IMAGINATION FREE.</i>

        THINGS HAVE
        GOTTEN PRETTY BAD
        AND I THINK IT'S HARD

        FOR PEOPLE TO IMAGINE
        THE WORLD WORKING
        ANOTHER WAY.

        SO WE'RE TRYING TO,
        AS REALISTICALLY
        AS POSSIBLE,

             PRESENT THIS WORLD
             AS IT COULD BE.

              Andy:
       <i>THEY JUST BROUGHT UP</i>
         <i>THE PROOF</i>

 OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND IT
  LOOKS UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE.

 <i>REALLY GOOD.</i>

      The obvious question:
how the heck did you do it?

     Andy, do you want to start?
     How long were you working
     on this thing

 - and how many of you?
 - There were a lot of us.
   It wasn't just the Yes Men.

It was a large group of people.
We were just one of many groups.

   <i>It was an idea that sparked</i>
 <i>a lot of people's imaginations.</i>

           <i>They wanted</i>
       <i>to see this happen.</i>

 And that's sort of the message
     of the paper as well--

        is "Great.
        We elected Obama
      and that's fantastic,

      <i>but now the real work</i>
             <i>begins."</i>

              Mike:
     <i>The idea was to put out</i>
  <i>something that was optimistic,</i>

       <i>that says we can do</i>
     <i>all these things.</i>
             <i>Why not?</i>

  We created the system that we
have now, so why not create
    a good one instead?

      - WOW, VERY GOOD.
      - LET ME TIE YOU UP.

     - THIS IS THE BIG DAY.
     - <i>"NEW YORK TIMES."</i>

      7:00 A.M. RUSH HOUR,
        THIS IS THE TIME

        TO GET THE PAPERS
        OUT THERE.

Woman: <i>FREE "NEW YORK TIMES."</i>

SPECIAL ISSUE.
SPECIAL ISSUE.

        "NEW YORK TIMES,"
     FREE "NEW YORK TIMES."

         SPECIAL EDITION
    OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES."

              Man:
      <i>FREE "NEW YORK TIMES."</i>

          IS THIS REAL?

     - IT'S FAKE, RIGHT?
     - WHO PUBLISHES THIS?

        CAN I GRAB
      ANOTHER ONE OF THESE?

             - WHAT?
             - WHAT?

"NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE
ACT PASSES."

       <i>SO THE PATRIOT--</i>
       <i>THE PATRIOT ACT REPEALED.</i>

             Woman:
   <i>"MAXIMUM WAGE LAW SUCCEEDS."</i>

    GOOD LUCK WITH THAT ONE.

  THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
BUT... IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

IT'S A DREAM NEWSPAPER.

     <i>RIGHT?</i>

 <i>IT'S LIKE YOU WAKE UP AND ALL</i>
 <i>THE THINGS THAT YOU WANTED</i>

    BECAME THE NEWS.

         THE WAR'S OVER!

              Mike:
     <i>OUR FAKE NEWS WAS A HIT.</i>

NEWSPAPER!
NEWS FROM THE FUTURE.

     <i>BUT WOULD THE REAL NEWS</i>
           <i>PICK IT UP?</i>

YOU DON'T WORK
FOR "THE NEW YORK TIMES."
WHO IS IT THAT YOU WORK FOR

HANDING THIS OUT?
A GUY NAMED JOHN-- JOHN SMITH.

      - YEAH, JOHN SMITH.
      - JOHN SMITH?

    IT'S "THE NEW YORK TIMES,"
    SPECIAL EDITION.  IS THERE
    ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT?

YEAH, IT'S NOT
"THE NEW YORK TIMES."

     <i>Read all about it.</i>

  <i>"The New York Times" declares</i>
     <i>the war in Iraq is over.</i>

Some commuters got
their hands on what
looks like a special edition

of "The New York Times."
As you might have
guessed though,

     - <i>it's a fake.</i>
     - ( speaking German )

      ( speaking Russian )

    We printed a paper
    with the headlines
     that we'd like to see.

        So if these were
          the headlines

that people were so excited
      to read this morning,

     let's make them happen.

           Lili Taylor:
         <i>WE'RE GONNA HAVE</i>
     <i>TO EXERCISE SOME MUSCLES</i>

    THAT WE EITHER DON'T HAVE
     OR THAT HAVE ATROPHIED.

         OR SOMETHING--
         A CIVIC MUSCLE,

     <i>A THRIFTY MUSCLE, </i>
     <i>A GENEROUS MUSCLE.</i>

         Medea Benjamin:
      <i>WE'VE GOT TO TAKE BACK</i>
         <i>OUR GOVERNMENT.</i>

  MARCH INTO CITY HALL AND SAY,
"HERE, WE'VE GOT T SOLUTIONS."

       Frances Fox Piven:
       <i>WE CAN THINK OF THE</i>
          <i>DIFFERENT WAYS</i>

     THAT WE CAN CONTRIBUTE
     TO A MOVEMENT THAT SAYS

        BUSINESS AS USUAL
        IS UNACCEPTABLE,

          <i>BECAUSE PEOPLE</i>
          <i>ARE BEING HURT</i>

       <i>AND WE'RE NOT GOING</i>
     <i>TO PLAY THE ROLE--</i>

        THE SUBSERVIENT,
          ROUTINE ROLE

      THAT WE USUALLY PLAY.

  - LET'S GO!
  - WE'RE GOING, WE'RE GOING.

          ( cheering )

MAKE CHANGE HAPPEN.
PUT YOUR EFFORT ON THE LINE
TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

AND THAT'S WHAT,
KINDA, WE DID HERE.

AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE--
IT'S WHAT...

YEAH, IT'S KIND OF, YEAH.

      - OH BOY!
      - NO, I KNOW, YEAH!

            AND IF A FEW PEOPLE
            AT THE TOP CAN MAKE
            THE BAD NEWS HAPPEN,

             THEN WHY CAN'T ALL
             OF US AT THE BOTTOM

          <i>GET TOGETHER</i>
          <i>AND MAKE THE GOOD NEWS</i>
          <i>HAPPEN FOR A CHANGE?</i>

              <i>I MEAN, FOR REAL?</i>
