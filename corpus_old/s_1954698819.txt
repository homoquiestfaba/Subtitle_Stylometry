Hey, Taryn.

Breakfast is ready!

Ooh, that looks good.

Thanks, hon.

Um... No butter?

You're on a diet.

Oh, right. How could I forget?

Ew. Guys, get a room.

You know, I'd be happy
just to get a waffle.

Have a wonderful first day,
senior.

Thanks, will.

Mom, this looks great. Thanks.

Smile. Mom, lease don't! No!

You ready?

Yes. I'm just gonna have
a quick breakfast.

No, are you <i>ready, Taryn?</i>

You've got college applications,
s.A.T.S, the prom.

This is going to be
an exciting year.

Well, I'm not holding my breath
for that.

Taryn,
you're a very smart girl.

You just need to focus.

I'm just making sure

you're dotting your I's
and crossing your t's.

That's all. I am, mom.

I'm dotting and I'm crossing.

I also think that you could
spend a little more time

prepping for your s.A.T.S.

Rather than messing around
with your phone.

Do you really need
to follow me online?

It's my job.
I have to keep tabs on you.

Mm. Great.

Hey, come by the office today
and say hello.

You'll be at school?

Yes. They asked for parent
volunteers for first day.

Oh. Lovely.

Oh, don't freak out
when you get your schedule.

Remember I told you colleges
like interesting electives?

I signed you up for yearbook.

Thanks.

Bye.

Bye.

"Class of..."

Class of awesome.

I was just gonna go
with the school year.

Here you go.
Booked, blurred, digged.

Wouldn't that be "dug"?

Boom. "Class of awesome."

Oh, yeah. So very awesome.

What's wrong? You're not
embracing the awesome.

Just same old.

Your mom? Yeah.

She's all over me about s.A.T.S
and applications and...

University of michigan? Yes.

Sucks, but it'll all be worth it
when we're there together.

How do you feel about christmas lights?
Elena...

I was thinking
we can line our dorm room

with white christmas lights.

You know, I'm thinking
I'm just gonna try

and get through
the school year first,

hopefully make track team,

maybe come up with a date
for the prom, you know,

before I start thinking
about white christmas lights.

Taryn, we're the dream team,
okay?

We're gonna kill it in college.

I'm not really killing it
in high school, so...

So use your senior year
to find your bliss.

Did you really
just quote joseph campbell?

You know, your thing.

You know, I am who I am.
I'm kind of a done deal.

So mix it up.

For example, check it.

Do you like it?

Holy crap!

Your hair is blue!

Wow!

You've
really taken nonconformity.

To a whole new level.

Well, you could do the same.

No, I don't think that blue
would suit my complexion.

Well, if you're worried
about being that girl

who always plays it safe,
who never gets into trouble,

who never makes it past
second base...

Third. I've been to third base.

Whatever.

All I'm trying to say is this
is your chance to mix it up.

You want people
to see you different,

you got to <i>be</i> different.

Find your freaking bliss.

And where does one look
for bliss?

Behind you.

Hey! Oh!

I missed you guys.

Hey. Yo.

Nice run this morning, Taryn.

You got fast over the summer.
Oh, thanks.

How was wayland?

Caledonia.

Nice memory.
Caledonia was boss.

Life-guarding,
horse-riding, decent cabins,

hot girls, cool kids.

I've got some summer pictures
on my phone, too.

Oh. You and rayna?

No. We broke up in july.

You and rayna broke up?

Yeah. It was just time,
you know?

We need to get to homeroom.

Wait. It's not even...

What is wrong with you?

Ryder just told you
that he's finally free.

Why are you running away?
He's into you.

Yeah, into me enough
to talk about

the "hot girls" in caledonia.

He likes me as a friend...
Just a friend.

No. Worse.

He likes me as a guy friend.

Do you think
it's actually possible

that ryder thinks that I'm a guy
with boobs?

Okay, first,
you barely <i>have</i> boobs.

Thanks.

Who's that?

New girl, I guess.

Her name's nina.

She got kicked out
of her last school.

I hear she's crazy
into some hardcore stuff.

Hardcore like an affair
with the principal?

I don't know. I just know it's
weird and it's hardcore. G.P.

Later, courtney.

Seriously...

Don't start.

Why are you nice to her?

Because she matters.

Not to me.

Come on. Let's go to homeroom.

I'll meet you there.

Are you okay?
Do you want me to call 911?

No. Is something...

I'll call 911. I'm... I'm cool.

It's... it's all good.
Just give me a second.

Look, do me a solid, okay?
Don't tell anyone that I was...

What the hell are you doing?

Uh, nina was helping me find
a contact lens.

Nina and you?

Yeah. Yeah.

Well, don't worry
about your contact.

I'm sure mommy has a whole stash
of personal items for you.

Yeah, it's... hi,
there, new girl nina.

I'm courtney,

which you would have found out
by the end of the day anyways,

'cause that's the way it is.

I'm going to offer you
a helpful heads-up.

At this school,

being nice gets you
a one-way ticket to g.P.

What do you mean g.P.?

General population.

Nice. It's no big deal.

It's just, like, courtney's
nickname for people who are...

Average, mediocre,
less than 100 followers online.

Look, nina, here's the deal...

People like shiny, new things.

That's you.

You're an asset.

Hang with me,
and you won't have to worry

about climbing
the social ladder.

You'll already be on top.

Jenny? Yes.

Steve?

Taryn, I'm meeting with your mom
at lunch

for the fundraiser
if you want to join us.

Lunch with her mommy?

Sure. Maybe.

And... nina, I assume?

That's me.

Great. Welcome to tec voc.

Everyone else, welcome to a
final year of homeroom with me.

Uh, since you all know the drill
by now

and we have 10 minutes
till first period,

anyone want to volunteer to give
nina a quick tour of the school?

I got this, ms. Moore.
Nina and I already talked.

I'll give her the grand tour.

Great.
You girls go ahead and...

Actually, Taryn's going to
give me the grand tour.

What?

I don't know.

Ready, Taryn?

Yeah.

So, um, the cafeteria
is on the other side of campus,

but, I mean, you'll probably eat
at the sundial.

Oh, is that where you eat?

No. I'm not really invited.

Um, english and also calculus

are in the homerooms
on this floor,

and then one up
is math and science.

Hey, I don't care. Oh, sorry.

No. I just meant

I can figure out classrooms
and stuff by myself.

How about you, you know,
show me the good stuff,

like where to sneak off campus,

which janitor's closets
are left unlocked,

best places to hook up
without getting busted.

I don't really know.

Seriously? And you're a senior?

So, you're from central?

Word gets around.

They didn't kick me out, if
that's what everyone's saying.

Oh. Is that
what everyone's saying?

My mom got a better job...

...which means we got
a better house.

This is supposed to
be a better school,

so here I am,

being all better
at the better school.

Cool gym.

So, what do you think?
Do you like it here?

Mm, I wouldn't say that.

Yeah. Feels kind of
like a prison, doesn't it?

But they all feel like that.

Different walls,
but the same message...

Keep your grades up
and your heads down.

Yeah, well, sounds about right.

Good news is that in a year,
none of this will matter.

Why?

Because we'll have escaped,

be the hell out
of this high-school crap.

That's why.

Then why make the prison
even worse?

I mean, courtney could make
your life miserable,

and you don't even know me.

Girls like courtney
are a dime a dozen.

They're at every school.

They're all the same,
and they all suck.

Besides, it was cool of you
not to rat me out

for my little game
in the bathroom.

Well, you know, I'm just glad
that I found you,

because, I mean,
I don't know about at central,

but, I mean, if they found out
you were doing drugs,

they would just...

Uh, what? I'm not into drugs.

Oh. You didn't take something?

No. Please. That's for people
who want to be out of control,

which is the last thing
that I'm into.

So what are you into?

Maybe I'll tell you sometime.

No. No. She's not going
to chapel hill.

No, she's not going
to syracuse, either.

No, all of those out-of-town
schools are way too expensive.

Yes, I have heard
of scholarships.

But I only got the last
four years alone with her.

I don't... I don't want to send
her hundreds of miles away.

I'm home!

Oh, Taryn's on her way in.
I-I'll talk to you later.

I love you, mom. Bye.

Hi!

Hey.

How'd it go?

Fine.

Really? How was yearbook?

It was fine. Just fine?

I was gonna use that hour
for a study period, mom.

I'm already taking
four a.P. Classes.

I'm not worried about that.
Well, I am.

Well, that's because you always
worry about the small stuff.

You should just worry
about the stuff that matters.

Hey, everyone. Hey.

How are you? I'm good. You?

Good. Fine.

So, how'd it go?

Fine.

That's the third "fine"
I've gotten in five minutes.

Mm-hmm.

Hmm.

Heidi? Taryn?

I'm just trying to help her
figure out her life.

Mom won't back off
trying to ruin my life.

Whoa.
Can I call a truce, please?

I'm going to my room.

What happened?

I don't know.

Yo, Taryn, what's up?

Let me guess... latte?

Decaf. Cool. Give me just a sec.

Hey, Taryn.

Nice to see you
off school property.

Your mom's really easing up.

Yeah, well, shstill
wanted me home for dinner.

You and your parents
eat dinner together?

Yeah, every night without fail.

Seems nice. Yeah, not really.

So, how's it going?

Oh, fine.
Uh, that steve guy asked me out.

No way!

A month and a half into school,

and you're still
the hot, new thing?

People see who you want them
to see.

Yeah, right.

How do you get that to happen?

What's with him?

What do you mean?

Oh, come on. Ryder, right?

You're always drooling over him
like a piece of steak.

No, I'm not.

A piece of chocolate, then.
What's the deal?

We've been friends forever,

and I wish that it was
different, but it's just...

Yo, Taryn, drinks.

Stop.

You're pretty, you're funny,
and you're cool.

Just go make him see that.

How?

Take control.

Show him
that there's more to you

than fist bumps and high fives.

Flirt a little.
Connect with him.

Ask him about his day

or tell him something cute
about yours.

Just try it.

Can't hurt, right?

Right.

Decaf latte and a spiced chai
for your friend.

So, how's school?

Cold.

My homeroom heater's jacked up
or something.

Oh, ours is the same way...
Freezing,

and then you go out
into the hallway,

and it's like way too hot.

Yeah. Someone really needs
to fix it.

What?

Are we really talking
about heating systems here?

Hey, ryder. Hey, courtney.
Can I get you a refill?

No. Just wanted to make sure
you got the 411 about my party.

Yeah, I heard. I'll be there.

Cool. Yeah, my parents
are going out of town.

My brother scored a keg.

Everyone's gonna be there,
so, you know... epic.

Oh, I am so sorry.

Am I interrupting
something here?

No. I-I was just
gonna go anyway, so...

I'm sorry.

You're sorry?

Wait.

Taryn, just wait a second.

Taryn, wait!

Hey, wait. Hold on. She's just
trying to piss you off.

It's fine.

I'm not the kind of girl who
takes the lead. Whatever.

Only because
you've never tried.

I can help you with that.

I appreciate it. Really, I do.
But I can't compete.

I mean,
I can't make ryder like me.

I'm not like courtney,
and I'm not like you, either.

But you could be.

I know a way to get
a little extra shot of mojo,

just a little boost to make you
feel like you can do anything.

What are you talking about?

Have you ever heard
of the choking game?

Yeah.

But, I mean, like...
Let me guess...

Anyone who's ever tried it dies
or ends up brain-dead.

Pretty much.

Yeah, well,
the people who believe that

also think that beer and sex
were invented by satan.

True.

But wasn't there that kid
in ypsilanti who died doing it?

Yeah, well, I mean,
how many people die every day

from getting in a car
or slipping in the shower?

You can make anything
seem dangerous

if you spin it the wrong way.

So you...

Do the choking thing,
like, a lot?

Please. At my last school,
it was bigger than booze.

And you don't have to get
an adult to buy it for you.

You have all the control.

Get control of yourself,
get control of your life.

It's the easiest thing
in the world.

Make people see
who you want them to see.

<i>Please come and pick them up</i>
<i>at the front desk.</i>

Oh, heidi,
I forgot to tell you that, uh...

That dinner got bumped
to the 23rd.

Okay. No, wait.
I can't go that night.

Why not?

There's a seniors' parents
meeting at the school.

Well,
this is my partner dinner.

I think you can miss
one parent/teacher meeting.

No, I really can't.

They're going to go over
college applications

and transitions
from high school into college,

and it's just a very important
night for Taryn.

Yeah, okay, well,
this is important to me.

Okay. I know.

Heidi, talk to me.

I mean, really talk.

Don't just rattle off
your to-do list.

What's going on?

She's becoming so...
I don't know.

I... she doesn't tell me
anything anymore.

She's almost 18.

Well, she never says anything
at dinner.

She's in and out of the house
so fast.

I'm home!

Hi. Do you want some breakfast?

No, got to get ready
for school.

See what I mean?

She's asking for her space.

Maybe we should give it to her.

Well, that's not
my strong suit.

Really? I didn't notice.

You're kidding. Okay, okay.
I'm gonna back off.

I'm sorry.
Can I have that in writing?

Thank you. Write it down.

For now. Write it down.

Okay, fine. I'll write it down.

Heidi is backing off. Mm-hmm.

Early much?

I just went to the gym.

I've still got to
get ready, though.

Being a runner must give you
some stellar breath control.

I guess.

Oh, that's right. You go more
for the ryder sightings.

So, um...

With your, uh...
Your choking...

You're interested?

Let's call it "curious."

Great. But I don't want to talk
about it over the phone.

Come over before school.

On my way.

So, you smoke any weed?

It doesn't do much for me.
Maybe I got the wrong kind.

What about you?

No, it makes me paranoid,

and I go through
way too many cheetos.

So, do you drink?
Mm, sometimes.

Next time you're at a party,
check out the drunk girls.

They all think they look cool,

but really,
they're stumbling and slurring

and throwing
their boobs around.

That's why
I like flying better.

Just cutting off the oxygen to
your brain for a couple seconds.

Is that all?

Relax.
It's not like you hang yourself.

Look, when you're hungry,
doesn't your body let you know?

Same thing when you're thirsty?

And when you're tired?

My body lets me know.

Think about it.

If you wanted
to commit suicide,

could you physically do it
by holding your breath?

No. Why?

Because I'd pass out.

Before...?

I died. Exactly.

When you need to breathe,
your body lets you know.

It's medical. It's science.
You're in control.

And being that in control,

being able to trust yourself
like that, it's...

It makes you able to have
control anywhere...

School, at home, with ryder.

There's this one girl
I've heard of

who can hold her breath
for like seven minutes.

She's kind of a legend. You can
find her on like all these...

Hi, girls.

Mom, don't you knock?

This is Taryn.

Hi, Taryn.
Nice to meet you.

Nina, pink or black?
For my date tonight.

First date or second? First.

Then pink.

Great. Thanks.

I thought you liked the guy
from yesterday.

He was okay.

This one's from
a more elite dating site.

He seems smarter
and definitely cuter.

I stocked up on frozen dinners.

Of course you did.

Don't wait up for me.

Nice to meet you, Taryn.

You guys eat frozen dinners?

What? She buys the good ones.

We'd better get to school.

That's the one good thing
about being in yearbook...

Seniors get a key.

Yeah.
Who needs a janitor's closet?

So, how often is it empty
at lunch like that?

Taryn, where were you?
I couldn't find you.

Hey. Sorry. Uh, we were just...

Working on a school project.

Uh, your hair's looking
really good, elena.

Thanks.

I'll see you later.

Dinner at 6:00? Yeah, great.

Great.

So, yesterday, all "checking in"
to street buzz.

Way to be proactive
on the ryder front.

I was just meeting nina.

New subject... your birthday.
What are we doing for the 1-8?

Sleepover?

Dude...

Sleepover with beer?

This is an important birthday.
You know that, right?

Yeah. Good point.
The age of escape.

I was thinking more along
the lines of the age where...

Taryn, hey.

Hey. Hi.

You bailed in a hurry
last night.

Oh, yeah. I-I remembered
I had to go do something.

Oh.

I'm going to class, Taryn.

Wait. I'm coming.

I'll see you.

I'm not much for subtleties,
but that was a thing.

I don't think so.

Ryder is hot, smart, and nice.

Look.

The vultures are swarming.

For real, ask him out already.

I'm not there yet.

Yeah, well,
you'd better work faster

if you want some of that.

I know.

Can I get you girls anything?

We're fine, mom.

Yeah. Thanks again for dinner.

Sure. You're welcome. I'm glad
you could join us, nina.

Yeah, me too.

Mom...

Looks like your mom
is pretty cool.

Yeah, well,
looks can be deceiving.

So you're like a stepford kid?

Everything's all perfect in
here, like from a magazine.

Bet you have something cute

in your uber-organized closet
for courtney's party.

Well, I haven't been invited
to courtney's party.

So?

You know ryder's gonna
be there, right?

Do we have to
go over this again?

All you have to do to belong
is act like you belong.

Owning the joint is believing
you own the joint.

I just want
to get out of the joint.

I can get you out for a minute
or two... or even less.

It's your call.

Okay, let's do it.

Only if you want to.

I want to.

Great.

So, I'm just gonna put my thumbs
right here...

Sorry, sorry.
I just wasn't ready.

Okay, let's do it.

No.

No?

No.

You don't really seem
like you want to,

and that's totally cool.

Look, I'm not some pushy boy
trying to talk you into sex.

There's no pressure here,
no deadlines.

When you're really ready
to try it, we'll try it.

And if not, no big.

Thank you.

In the meantime,
you can be my wingman!

Here. Come on.

Here.

Don't worry. You won't hurt me.

So how will I know
when to stop?

I'll put my hands
on your wrist.

When I've had enough,
I'll let go.

And when I let go, you let go.

It's my body, so I know
what it's telling me.

You have to trust me. Cool?

Okay.

Trust me.

Unless I drop my hands,
don't let go.

Don't... let... go.

Go.

Am I doing this right?

Nina? Nina?

I-I don't... talk to...

Say something, please, nina.
Nina!

I think I should let go!

I think I should let...
Nina, ta...

I think I should let go!
Nina. Nina?

Nina?

Nina?

Nina?! Nina?!

Oh, my god.

Nina!

Nina!

Holy crap. That was awesome.

What is going on in here?!
I heard screaming.

Mom, nothing! We're fine!

Are you girls sure you're okay?

Mom, we're fine!

Yeah, never better!

I'm sorry. It was
a rocking song on the radio.

I'm sorry we worried you.
It was my bad.

We're fine.

Okay.

Oh, my god, you're a pro!

Really?

That was okay?

That was better than okay!

You were like my parachute,
my safety net.

Because you were doing it,

I could totally go
to that other place.

Normally, I only get a grayout,

but that was a full ride,
total blackout.

You're a rock star!
A rock star?

To you, maybe.

Me now, ryder later.

Act like you believe something,
and everyone else will, too.

Anyway, I better get going.

See you at school!

Good night.

Good night, nina.

Taryn...

What was really
going on in here?

We were just hanging out.

Are you sure?

Yes. Mom...

Come on, tar... mom!

We have a deal, right?

You, me, and only the truth.

Okay. Well...

I like this guy,

and he's never really shown
before that he likes me,

and so nina said
that I should talk to him.

And so I did,
and he sent me a text.

And I got really excited
about it,

and I guess I just...
We were too loud about it.

I'm sorry.

I know it's silly, but...

What?

You just haven't talked to me
that much about boys before.

Track, yes.

Actually...

I think it's really great,

and I'm glad you have a friend
to share it with.

Nina seems like
a really great girl.

Yeah, she is.

Cool.

Here we go with the boys.

Hey. Hey.

I thought you had
something to do today.

I do. I did. It's done.

Mysterious much?

Check it.

Someone's favorite indie band
is playing at wilson's chapel.

Oh, my gosh! Greer!
I love them!

Check the date.

My birthday.

Told you I'd come up with
something cool for us to do.

Wilson's chapel...
Isn't that a bar?

Yep. And that's the other part
of your present.

My cousin is scoring us
fake I.D.S.

Shut up. Right?

Oh, my gosh! You rock.

Thank you. And yeah, I do.

Is that a new shirt?

Yeah. It's, uh... it's nina's.

What's that?

Uh, youth hostels in europe.

Don't tell me
you're actually considering

that gap-year thing.

I'm actually considering
the gap-year thing.

We had plans.

No.

You had plans, elena, and...

I'm still trying
to figure mine out.

What about our kick-ass
dorm room at u of m?

Do you want
to escape that, too?

I think that I need to see more
before I can make a decision.

Maybe travel is my bliss.

Maybe crazy is your bliss.

Ask him out already.

Hey. How's it going?

Good. Hi. What's that?
Medical terminology?

Yeah, I'm just trying to get ahead
of the game for college next year.

Oh. I thought you were going
for a football scholarship.

No. I'm gonna be premed.

Oh.

Have you forgotten how you and I
used to nerd out together?

No, I just...

Now you do football.

Yeah, and now you wear contacts.
We're still the same people.

Well, not completely.
I'm not a latchkey kid anymore.

Well, I still am, only
I don't spend every afternoon

in your basement playing
video games these days.

Which means I'm still
reigning champion.

You wish! I won the last game.

Right.

Oh, you're making me miss
my empty house.

Now my mom is home all the time.
Seriously all the time.

Well, maybe I could talk
to your mom

about leaving the house
more often.

It's rayna.

I thought you guys broke up.

She texted me, asking to talk.

Go ahead.

I can call her later.

Oh, it's cool.
You should talk to her.

You want me to talk to her?

Well, I mean,

if you want to talk to her,
you should talk to her.

Hey, rayna. No, you're not
interrupting anything.

Hey.

I'm ready.

Cool. Meet me before homeroom
tomorrow, okay?

There's something fun about
risky public behavior, you know?

I do know.

So, you're sure you're ready?

To grow some balls? Yeah.

I am ready.

Good. Because I'm not
going to touch you.

What?

This is about you,
you trusting yourself.

Feel this?

That's all the power you need.

Right here.

It's yours.

Ready?

Go.

Keep holding.

You've got this, Taryn.
Keep holding on.

Don't give up.
You're so strong.

You're stronger
than you think you are.

Keep going, Taryn!
Keep going, keep going!

You are stronger than you think
you are. Keep going!

Keep pushing for it!

Keep going, keep going,
keep going!

Taryn?

Taryn?

Hey. How are you?

Amazing.

That was amazing.

Oh... my... god.
You guys are so busted.

Hey, I got your text.
What's wrong?

I saw courtney talking
to ms. Moore.

Hey, it's okay. Relax.
I can't relax.

If my mom finds out about
what we were doing...

...she will freak out.

She won't get
that it's not a big deal.

And then I-I'll have to forget
about my car and track team and...

Hey, no one's freaking.

Courtney's probably
just talking to her

about school or something.

Yeah, right.

Maybe she's sucking up
to get better grades.

Who the hell knows?

Better get to class.

Why?

You mean here?

Concrete floor
is too dangerous.

Don't worry.
We'll find somewhere better.

Besides, do you really want
to go sit in calculus?

Okay, anyone whose butt
is not in their chair right now.

Is officially late.

Um, okay, guys, I looked over
your pop quizzes

from last week,
and not super-impressive...

All better?

Yeah.

Come on. Let's go.

You're kind of a natural at it.
You know that, right?

Must be all the running
or something.

You see how when you come
close to the edge,

you just don't care about
all that stupid crap anymore?

If courtney narcs us out,
we'll just say she's lying.

There's no proof,
and it's two against one.

Act like you believe it.

I've got something for you.

What is it?

A couple cool websites.

But check them out later
when you're alone.

Websites for...

Yeah. And not
the "you're gonna die" kind.

These are underground websites.

You have tbe invited

through special hidden links
to get there.

Ooh, clandestine.

Totally not
"general population."

Oh, my gosh, Taryn.
This is so amazing.

Right on time.
What did I tell you?

See? You worry too much
sometimes.

Incoming. Go for it.

Now that you're not
a pansy anymore.

Hey, Taryn. You look great.

You sound surprised. Come on.

You know I've always thought
you're pretty.

You just amped it up a notch
or something.

Thank you.

Are you going to courtney's party?
Why?

Because I'm going. It would
be cool to see you there.

I can't.
I have this thing with elena.

Could you get out of it?

I wish.

Missed you at lunch.

I ate at the sundial.

Oh.

Hey, what are you up...

Oh, it's nothing.

It's just a social-networking
site. It's no big deal.

I've got something
that <i>is</i> a big deal.

Check this.

Cool.

"Cool"? Did you even see it?

Yeah. I said it's cool.

What the hell?

What?

I just scored you a fake I.D...
A really good fake I.D.

You don't even care?

Let me guess.

Nina can get you a better one
or something?

What are you talking about?

And what does nina
have to do with this?

I don't know.
It just seems like nina

has something to do
with everything these days.

Well, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that I
wasn't allowed to have other friends.

I didn't say that.
That's not what I...

Are you high?!

No. God, what are you, my mom?

Dude, your eyes are all red.

Yeah, because I was up late,
filling out applications. Happy?

No, actually, I'm not happy.
And I'm not buying it.

You're not being yourself.

Well, maybe this is myself.
Maybe I found my bliss.

I mean, isn't that what you wanted
me to do in the first place?

This isn't your bliss.
This is <i>her</i> bliss.

God, you're acting so weird.

That is priceless,
coming from you.

What's that supposed to mean...
Coming from me?

Well, I know you get off
on being all,

like, anti-establishment
and whatever,

but that is not the way
to make friends.

You know, when you act
all like... like what?

Like the blue hair

and the whole
"I don't conform" thing.

I mean, you're really
not doing yourself any favors.

You mean when I'm myself?

I'm going to go do
something alternative,

like hang out with people
who don't suck.

Hey, hon.

Dinner's almost ready. Cool.

Oh, speaking of,

where would you like to go
for your birthday dinner?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Anywhere you want...

The most expensive place
you can imagine.

You know what? Bankrupt us.

I don't really want to think
about it right now.

Well, we know you have plans
with elena that night,

so we'll just take you out
the next night.

Um, I'm not sure
if I have plans anymore, so...

Oh, really? Why not?
Nothing. It's just...

I don't know.

What is that?

It's nothing.

Is that a hickey?

Mom, do you have to
be so nosey?!

Honey, just give her a second.

What? I am her mother.
I have a right to...

To what?! To invade my privacy
all the time?! No, you don't!

Okay, you don't get to talk
to me like that.

So now you're gonna tell me
how to talk, too?!

Taryn.

That's it. Keys.

What?! Now!

But I didn't do anything!

Now!

Fine!

God!

Car is a privilege,
not a right.

Damn it.

You need to calm down, honey.

I mean, Taryn's
a responsible kid.

She's gonna start dating
at some point.

Maybe it's now.
Maybe it's in college.

It's not about that.

It's about her thinking it's
okay to talk to me like that.

Yeah, it's called hormones.

It's more than that.

She has a whole different
attitude.

It doesn't mean anything.
All teenagers act like that.

My daughter doesn't.

Well, clearly she does.
She's not perfect.

I know that.

Do you?

Because you don't always act
like you do.

When did you get to be
such an expert on kids?

I think I know enough.

She's my daughter, will,

and I know that something
is going on with her.

I'm gonna go search her car.

Hey.

Afterglow is good, huh?

Totally.

What a rush.

Gets your mind off school
for a little while, huh?

But I'm still worried that
courtney's gonna narc us out.

Oh, stop ruining the moment.

I am telling you,
we're covered.

Oh, hey!
I just sent you a cool link.

Open it up on a bigger screen.

Okay, hold on.
I'll just put you on speaker.

Do you got it?

"You have been invited
to play the game."

Yeah.

So, what am I looking at?

See the green dot?

That's you
in your neighborhood.

Click on it.

So, all the other dots are...?

People playing nearby.

See anyone you know?

Bryce from school.

No way.
Is he playing right now?

Naughty boy.

No, check out summit street.

There you are.

Cool, right?

Yeah, totally cool.

Okay, I'm out. See you later.

Okay. I'll talk to you later.

What's going on?

Taryn, we need to talk.

We know what's happening.

What do you mean?

You...

Turned 18.

Happy birthday!

Thanks, guys.

What happened in here?

Uh, never mind, never mind.
Happy birthday, Taryn.

Happy birthday, honey.

I'm going to the bathroom.

Oh, here.

Hey, hey.
What the hell are you doing?

I-I acted calm, didn't I?

Heidi,
what are you looking for?

I don't know.

If I knew what I was looking
for, I'd know where to look.

You look in there.
Heidi, stop it.

You're not gonna find anything.

She's acting like a teenager.

Between high school
and her hormones,

it's a wonder she's still
on her feet.

Give her a break.

We're talking about a kid who's
never even been in detention.

Stop it. Put it down right now.
Put it down.

I just... Look at this room.

We're talking about a girl

who's been a neat freak
her whole life.

And... and... and look at this.
Do you see what I mean?

And now...
Please, just stop it.

Please.

I just have a feeling
something is off.

Okay.

Why weren't you in homeroom?

I had better things to do,
I guess.

Right. Looking up youth hostels
in liechtenstein or whatever.

Taryn, we need to talk.

I'll pick you up at 8:00.

Wait. What?
You still want to go?

I'm not so alternative

that I abandon my friends
on their birthday.

Where were you?

I was feeling sick.

Um, but I wanted
to drop this off.

I know it's a few days late.
Why are you doing this?

Taryn, consider this
your opportunity

to have a conversation with me

before I have to get
your parents involved.

Okay.

So talk. What's going on?

I'm not sure.

Look, I know your class load
is heavy,

but you've always been able
to handle it before.

Now, what is this about?

You failed my test last week,

and now I'm getting grades
from your other teachers...

Low c's, high d's?
Taryn, this isn't you.

I know. I'm sorry. I just...
I've got a lot going on.

Well, you need
to pull it together,

'cause you know there's
not gonna be any track team

with this gpa, right?

Okay.

You've always been
a good student, Taryn.

Don't let it slide now,
when you're so close to the end.

Yes, ma'am. Okay.

No freaking way.

My mother knows
my locker combination?

Can you stop?!

Do you have the ability
to just stop?

What are you talking about?

Everything.
I'm talking about all of it!

Can you stop trying to live
for me and stay out of my life?!

You need to settle down.

Well, you need to stop invading my
privacy and leave my stuff alone!

Well I let things go
as long as I could,

but there's only so long
you can act this oddly

without, you know,
expecting something to change.

I went through your bedroom
because you...

What?!
You went through my room?

Yeah. Your bedroom
is in my house.

But it's my bedroom.

Under my roof, my rules.
Oh, my god!

You need to butt out
and get a life!

Seriously, I can't go
a single day

without you trying
to get in the way somehow.

What, would you rather have a
mother who's not around at all?

Yes. That would be amazing.

You know,
I've actually changed, mom.

My life is getting better.

Well, you don't seem
all that happy to me.

Are you angry with me because
I've been trying to help you?

I'm upset with you

because you're always
trying to live for me.

I-I'm just trying to help you.

Can you please just find a hobby
or an activity or anything?

Just come up with anything,
seriously.

Come up with anything
that doesn't involve me.

You need to get a life

so that you'll stop trying
to live mine for me.

And don't wait up. Taryn...

Elena's taking me out
for my birthday,

which you've
pretty much ruined.

Don't tell me.
You changed your mind?

No, but I need you to pick me up
from somewhere else.

Not at your house?

No. Definitely not at my house.

Let me guess... nina's?

Is that a problem?

Yeah. I'm not picking you up
at nina's.

She has a car.
She can drive you.

Fine. Whatever.
I'll see you there.

Fine.

Thanks for picking me up.

Not a problem.

Sorry about your mom...
And elena.

Yeah, well, this is
pretty much turning

into, like,
the worst birthday ever.

Hey. You're in control now.

If you don't like the way things
are going, you can change it.

True, but I just don't know
where to start.

Yes, you do.

We'll, uh, have
a little private party

before we go to courtney's.

I'm not going to courtney's
party, remember?

I'm meeting elena
at wilson's chapel.

No worries! I'll get you there
on time, I promise.

Come on.

We'll just go there for a little
while, make an appearance.

Courtney is, like, the last
person I want to see right now.

Well, we're not going
for courtney.

Come on.
You're gonna look so hot,

ryder won't know what hit him.

In this? I don't think so.

I've got the perfect outfit,
and it's yours.

Consider it
my birthday present.

Thanks.

Come on.
We'd better get started.

Holy hell.
You almost went three minutes.

Yeah, well,
my teacher kind of kicks ass!

Just wait. You'll end up like one
of those legendary breath girls.

Yeah, screw everything.

Screw my grades. Screw my mom.

Screw it all.

Especially screw your grades.

You are so far ahead
of the finish line,

you can afford
to relax a little.

And how about this
for a birthday?

This is not g.P.

You are not g.P. Anymore,
not looking like that.

Thanks to your wardrobe.

That's not it. You belong here.

And you know what I think?
I think tonight's the night.

The night?

<i>The</i> night for you and ryder.

I don't know.

All right. Come on.

Wait. Where are we going?

Just to find an empty room,
have a little shot of fun...

Just a little
confidence booster.

Okay, but I'm going first.

Absolutely.

Love the outfit.

Too bad it's so last season.

Keep drinking!

Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

You'll follow your mom
to rehab.

G.P. Alert. Get him out.

Come on. Let's do this.

You do this.

Right, 'cause you'd hate it
if we did it together?

Hey.

Taryn, I thought you had
something to do tonight.

I do have something to do.

Follow me.

O-kay.

Where are we going?

Come on. It's, uh...

Let's go over here. Whoa.

Okay, this is a little... whoa.
What are you doing?

Shut up.

Okay. Whoa. Are you drunk?

No. Come on!
What are you doing? Stop.

Don't you want this?

Taryn, I'm serious. Stop.

What's wrong with you?

Come on. Ryder.

Stop.

I thought you wanted this.

Who <i>are</i> you?

Don't worry.

By tomorrow,
he'll be kicking himself

for not taking you up
on your offer.

Ahh.

Yeah, but he looked so...

Hey, courtney. Great party.

Better than the ones
at your old school?

Almost the same...
Music, a keg, dancing,

by midnight somebody yakking
on the carpet.

Well, at least this one's free
of general pop.

Really, courtney?

Still with your
general-population crap?

What are you...

So what if you caught us
under the bleachers?

You know, what we were doing
was not generation population,

and that is something that you,

with your bitchiness
and your queen bee,

you would not even have
the balls to...

Okay. Hold on.

Taryn, chill.
I-I wasn't talking about you.

The bleachers...
I'm cool with it.

Sometimes I do it with nick.

You do?

Yeah. It's not like
you invented choking.

I just didn't know
you were into it.

I didn't actually bust you,
did I?

Are you kidding me?!

I thought when nina tagged you
in her "check in,"

she was just messing around.

But, no, you actually blew me
off for this stupid-ass party.

Okay, freak. So not worth it.

Taryn's a big girl.
She can handle it.

Come on. Let's go do our thing.
I'll spot you.

Thanks. Last time I flew,

I fell,
almost cracked my head open.

Tell me about it.

Elena, I'm so sorry. I was just
coming here first, and...

Who <i>are</i> you?

My Taryn doesn't come
to stupid parties

with stupid people
and blow me off.

I don't know why I'm even trying
to stay friends with you.

God. Why did I think
it was a good idea

for us to be roommates?

We are not gonna be roommates.
I know.

You're screwing around europe.

No. It's not just that, okay?

I blew my s.A.T.S.

I did not just whiff them.
I blew them.

And I'm not filling out
an application

for university of michigan,

because even if I get in,
I don't even want to go there!

'Cause I don't know what I want
to do or where I want to go.

It might not even be college.

But it's gonna be
my own choice,

and I'm gonna live my own life
no matter what!

Great party, courtney!

Thanks, courtney!
See you monday!

Taryn, hey.

What gives?

First, you jump me,
and then you avoid me,

and now you're trying to sneak
out of courtney's house?

Just leave me alone, okay?

I don't understand.

You used to be funny,
and you used to be normal.

You never used to
look like <i>this.</i>

I've changed.

Yeah. For the worse.

Where's the girl I liked,
the one I gave that cupcake to?

You gave me that cupcake?

Who else would it be?

Why do you think rayna and I
even broke up?

What do you mean?

Because all I ever did
was talk about you.

You did?

It doesn't matter now, Taryn,

because you're not that girl
anymore.

Get in.

Hey, I've been looking
all over for you.

You could have told me
you were leaving.

I don't need to run
everything by you.

Hey, what's with the attitude?

Is this about elena? You need
to get over her already.

It's not just elena, okay?

Your thing with ryder?
Whatever.

So he's the kind of guy who
can't handle a strong chick.

You don't want a guy like that.

He's exactly the guy I want,

and

that's why I did all of this
in the first place.

Fine. Then we'll go
play the game,

and we'll figure out
how to get him.

We just did that.

So, what,
you're just gonna give up?

I don't know. I just...

In case you forgot,
you used to live in loserville

with your pretty bedroom
and your perfect mom

and your zero social life.

People used to call you
"general population."

Now you get to go to actual
parties, like a real person.

Wait, Taryn.

Look, some people just can't
roll with change, okay?

You should be thanking me for
showing you a way to escape.

Thanking you?

I don't even want to be
around you right now.

I know, I know,

but she's never
just not come home before.

You drove by the school, right?

What about the track at the gym?
Maybe she went for a run.

No.

No, no.

Elena's not answering her phone.
No one's answering their phone.

Hold on.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

She's here. Please come home.

I'll just assume that
I'm grounded or whatever.

Where have you been?
I've been worried sick.

I was at a party.

With elena?

She was there, yeah.

Really?

Because elena called here
last night three times

looking for you.

Well, she was there
eventually, okay?

No, it's not okay.
None of this is okay.

And, yes, you are
definitely grounded,

and there are going to be
a lot of changes around here.

I don't care if you're 18.

Fantastic. More change.

Taryn, talk to me.

I'm fine.

No, you are not.

Yeah, well, it's senior year.

I mean

everything's supposed to
be angsty and different.

I know.

But <i>you</i> seem different.

Look at me.

I'm listening.

Talk to me, please.

You can tell me. It'll be okay.

Whatever it is, it'll be okay.

Everyone's mad at me,

and they're right.

And then I try to change things,
and nothing's working.

Well, you're... you're 18.
You're barely 18.

You're not supposed to have
everything all figured out.

But you make it
seem like I have to.

Will you come sit down with me?

Taryn, please,
come and sit down.

After your dad died,

I hated

that you had to come home alone
after school every day.

I-I-I just couldn't stand
that you were so young

and you knew how to use a key

and the microwave
and the washing machine.

And when will and I got married

and he offered to let me
take a break from working,

all that guilt went away,

and I was able to focus on you.

I guess I did that
a little too much, huh?

Well,
I'm sorry that I told you.

That you needed to get a life.

I get it.

You need your own life, right?

Taryn, things change.

And since they do,
they can change again.

I'm just glad she's okay.

And I'm glad we finally talked,
got things out in the open.

How you doing?

Not too good.

I messed up.

Yep.

No, I mean, I also had
a fight with nina,

and I just want to make...

I just want
to make things better.

I really think that it's time

that I started to try
to make things right.

So, what do you want
to do about it?

Why don't you give her a call?

I tried, but she didn't answer.

I don't think that she wants
to talk to me right now.

Well, that's your decision.

What?

Really?

45 minutes.

Thank you.

Well, she looks rough.

Guess that's not surprising.

How are you?

Just so you know...

I'm scared.

You're never scared.

I'm always scared.

I'm just...

Better than you at faking it.

That's why I wanted you
to come to michigan with me.

I'm scared to be by myself.

I'm scared to start over.

All I want to do is start over.

I'm sorry.

You're gonna be fine, you know?

Wherever you end up going.

Will we be fine?

Eventually.

Hey, Taryn...

You know when I told you that
you should follow your bliss?

I didn't mean...

I know.

You should keep looking for it.

Watch it.

We're back to that? Nice.

Seriously?

After what happened to nina?

Nina was stupid.

She thought she was in control,
but she wasn't.

And you are?

I'm not nina, okay? I'm smart.

Nina was smart, too, you know?

Yeah, well, not everyone
who chokes ends up like nina.

Bye, Taryn.

Courtney...

I'm around.

Just so you know...

I'm around.

Thanks for coming.

I just figured that if I drove

that I would keep going
and I wouldn't stop.

You're doing the right thing.

What the hell
are you doing here?

Maria, you must be so upset.

You have no idea how I feel.

Please...
What is wrong with you?

Wait a minute. I thought
you were nina's friend.

Nina was doing this a long time
before she met Taryn.

She's the one that got
my daughter into it.

But this...
This is no time for blame.

It's my fault.

It's not.

I shouldn't have moved her
during senior year.

I should
have paid more attention.

I did nothing
but pay attention.

It didn't make a difference.

I just...

I can't believe
nina was doing this... thing,

this awful thing, all the time.

And I never knew.

How could you know?

Even when I knew something
was going on with Taryn,

I-I-I would have
never guessed this.

I didn't even know this existed.
Did you?

No.

Taryn really wanted to be here.

You know, you're the only ones
who've come.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Hey, nina.

I'm sorry.

I know I haven't come to see you
in like two weeks.

I wanted to come... visit you
at the hospital,

but I figured
that you didn't want to see me,

so I just waited
till you came here.

I hope that's okay.

You look good. I like the top.

It's...

Nina, are you okay?

Are you okay?

Nina?

Nina, you were right.

You came to the school, and...

You saw me in a different way.

Everybody else just saw
the same, old Taryn.

And you were right for that.

And I just...

I wanted things
to be different.

I wanted to feel in control.

But you were wrong, too.

You were wrong
about what to do...

And how to handle it.

And I was wrong
for going along with it.

It's not fair.

It's not fair.

I'll see you later.

Nina, I'm here.

I'm here.

There you are.

I'm here. I'm listening.

I'm listening. Talk to me.

Talk to me.

I'm listening. Talk.

You beat me here.

Hey. Yeah.

I already ordered, so...

Thanks for coming.

How's nina?

Um...

Not good.

When she choked, she hit her
head, and... it's not good

at least she didn't die.

Yeah, well, this is worse.

I'm sorry.

For which part?

For all of it.

Mostly for the party.

I screwed up.

And...

I mean, I was so stupid
for jumping you like that.

To be fair, a lot of guys
probably wouldn't complain.

Yeah, well, I still screwed up.

Can we start over?

From where? How far back?

Elementary school?

I mean, isn't that where
we were friends and it was easy?

I don't think that
we can rewind that far.

Here you go, hon. Enjoy.

Maybe we can go back
to the part

where you liked me
and I liked you,

before everything got crazy
and screwed up.

Is that doable?

Yes.

And maybe we can try
that thing again.

What thing?

I think I found my bliss.

What?

I'll tell you later.

Hey! That was mine!

Oh, my god!

I'm sorry.

Yeah, you are.
