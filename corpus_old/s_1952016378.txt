I spoked to a
professional person, who has told me

that what was happening to me,
was what they described as

a pre-meltdown penultimate.

<i>This are perhaps
the last haunting words</i>

<i>of director Damien Cockburn,</i>

<i>the director of the film
Tropic Thunder, a film</i>

<i>that like a cinematic Titanic,
was doomed to sink,</i>

<i>taking with it it's cast and crew,
before it even come ashore</i>

<i>on the shores of the American cinema.</i>

<i>War, a theme that has inspired
countless directors</i>

<i>and Hollywood productions.</i>

<i>But what is war?</i>

<i>What is it mean
to take another man's life?</i>

<i>War is murder,</i>

<i>or institutionalized genocide?</i>

<i>What is it in our nature, that
compels perfectly rational human beings</i>

<i>to kill one another?</i>

It turns!
And action!

<i>None of these questions
interested me.</i>

<i>What interests me
is making a documentary</i>

<i>about making of a film,
that led to it's on unmaking.</i>

Hello.

I am documentary filmmaker, Jan JÃ¼rgen.

For many years,
I have been fascinated

by the most magicalist of all
places, Hollywood.

As a boy growing up in Wiesbaden,
Germany,

I would go to the cinema,

and marvel at the larger than life
film gods on the silver screen.

Mark Hamil, James Garner,
and of course, Barbara Hershey.

But I also remember
thinking to myself:

"Is there are a more forbidding
sinister side to Hollywood,

"than the lies perpetuated
by the studio system?

Of course,
these are the questions of a child.

But that question
still lingers to this day.

<i>Last year I was ask to document
the making of a Vietnam war classic</i>

<i>called Tropic Thunder.</i>

What you're about to see, is it
unflinchingly as possible a look

at the making of a Hollywood nightmare.

My nightmare:
Tropic Thunder.

<i>In the fall of 2007,</i>

<i>the renowned Broadway theater director,
Damien Cockburn</i>

<i>was shooting one of the most
expensive Vietnam war movie ever made.</i>

Roll camera, please!

<i>Costing well over 300 million,
and filming on location in Vietnam,</i>

<i>Tropic Thunder boasted one of the
most unlikely cast of all time.</i>

Don't fucking whine.
What do you think, I am a dick?

<i>Cracking under the pressure
of a blockbuster filmmaking,</i>

<i>Damien and his cast suddenly
and mysteriously disappeared.</i>

<i>Rumors abundant</i>

<i>about the whereabouts of actors
Tugg Speedman and Jeff Portnoy...</i>

<i>Studio's head,
Les Grossman refuses to finance</i>

<i>additional search effort saying, quote:</i>

<i>"I spend all the money
I am going to spend on this film. "</i>

<i>But what actually happened
to the cast and crew of Tropic Thunder?</i>

<i>To answer these questions,
we must take a journey,</i>

<i>not just in the heart of the conflict
that was the Vietnam War,</i>

<i>but also a journey into madness.</i>

<i>In 2005, Damien purchased the rights</i>

<i>to an obscure memoir,
called Tropic Thunder,</i>

<i>written by retired army sergeant,
and Vietnam veteran,</i>

<i>John "Four Leaf" Tayback.</i>

<i>Four Leaf, named such because of
it's incredible luck in battle</i>

<i>was the platoon sergeant of an
elite handpicked group of soldiers,</i>

<i>code named:
Tropic Thunder.</i>

<i>Sent on suicide mission
behind enemy lines,</i>

<i>the men of Tropic Thunder
never returned.</i>

<i>However, Four Leaf
miraculously survived,</i>

<i>and single handedly
completed the mission.</i>

<i>But in the process
he lost every single hand.</i>

<i>The studio director, Les Grossman,</i>

<i>chairman and CIO of ImagiCorp,</i>

<i>sensing commercial success,
snapped up the auction of the script.</i>

<i>He wanted to go in the production
immediately.</i>

<i>Virtually overnight,</i>

<i>Grossman lavished over 140 million
American dollar on the film.</i>

<i>Flushed with cash,
Damien's confidence</i>

<i>seemed to grow exponentially
in proportion with the new budget.</i>

How would you describe
yourself directorially?

I often get asked this question,

and the most succinct way,
to describe myself:

50% Werner Herzog,

50% Hal Ashby,
and 50% Peter Bogdanovich.

Yes, but that's 150%.

Yes, I guess it is.

<i>With set built, and the crew in place,
Damien began casting the film.</i>

<i>The first actor to be cast was
the reclusive Australian Method actor</i>

<i>and notorious bad boy
from down under, Kirk Lazarus.</i>

<i>No doubt, because of his award cache,
Grossman offered him the lead.</i>

Every day, than I wake up,
I thank my father

for being an abusive alcoholic.

Because it was that exact
kind of environment,

that I find, makes great talent.

<i>Lazarus total commitment on past roles</i>

<i>had been borderline unnerving.</i>

<i>While in Ireland, preparing to play
the gay priest in "Satan's Alley",</i>

he was once found circumcising an
adult male behind a pub in Belfast.

<i>However, Lazarus, who have claimed</i>

<i>that was no acting challenges left
for him, shunned the part of Four Leaf,</i>

<i>and insisted instead
to play the black sergeant,</i>

<i>Lincoln Osiris.</i>

<i>In preparation, Lazarus went to
extraordinary and controversial lengths,</i>

<i>when he had his skin surgically
altered in a Singapore clinic.</i>

<i>The results, however,
were simply astonishing.</i>

<i>He was a true carbon copy
of the original man.</i>

<i>During pre-production,
we visited him on several occasions.</i>

<i>Never once did he dropped character.</i>

But you got to walk a mile
in a man shoes.

Thats what I did. I walked a mile
in shoes, thats right.

Now, this are 1977 sneakers.

That's what you gotta do.

There is a myriad of black actors
we could cast,

but that's what people do.

Who else are you thinking?

The list is endless.

Denzel Washington,

Sidney Poitier.

I could go on.

<i>Damien seemed blind to the pitfalls
of casting a white actor</i>

<i>to play the part of an African American.</i>

We talked about,
whether if it was racist or not.

We came to the conclusion

that it definitely not racist,
so that was reassuring.

<i>The race no longer an issue,</i>

<i>Lazarus demanded,
that the actual family</i>

<i>of the real Sergeant Osiris,</i>

<i>flown from Galveston, Texas
all the way to Vietnam.</i>

<i>His commitment to the role
was breathtaking.</i>

It's working.

It's working.

<i>Back in L.A., Les Grossman
and his producer, Rob Slolom,</i>

<i>continued their search
for the role of Four Leaf.</i>

<i>Smelling a bargain, their top choice
was action colossus Tugg Speedman.</i>

<i>Speedman "Scorcher" franchise
grossed over 3.4 billion worldwide.</i>

<i>However, Speedman's fee,</i>

<i>which used to be 25 million
dollars of picture,</i>

<i>had fallen sharply
just under five million.</i>

Here we go again.

Again!

<i>The reason? Several failed attempt
to expend his appeal to audiences.</i>

<i>Simple Jack, the story of an
intellectually challenged horse whisperer</i>

<i>was a nauseating and cloying
attempt, not just to win awards,</i>

<i>but also respect in Hollywood.</i>

I like, when we touch heads.

<i>He desperately needed to revive
his anemic career.</i>

Wake up, Pom-Pom.

<i>Many people questioned,
whether Speedman had the intelligence</i>

<i>to tackle the complexity of such a role.</i>

You have been casted
for the role of Four Leaf.

What is it about this American hero,

that made you so desperate,
to play this role?

It's an interesting exploration
of the American... thing.

One more question...
Thank you.

You are going to be allowed
to push hair?

<i>Speedman got the part.</i>

<i>The next role to be cast
was the part of Fats.</i>

<i>Again, Grossman inserted
himself in the process,</i>

<i>by inexplicably casting
celebrity train wreck,</i>

<i>and known drug addict, Jeff Portnoy.</i>

<i>A man-child who had made millions</i>

<i>on its ability, to make
himself fart on command.</i>

Gross!

<i>Portnoy first become known
to the American audiences</i>

<i>in his hit television series:
Heat Vision and Jack,</i>

<i>where he played a
maverick genius astronaut</i>

<i>whose best friend was
a talking motorcycle.</i>

Knowledge is power.
For real.

<i>His fame went global, when he began
starring in a string of pre-pubescent</i>

teenage fart comedy's,
such as Fart Club,

<i>and his flagship franchise:
The Fatties.</i>

<i>Portnoy frequent and dazzling
public meltdowns</i>

<i>didn't seem to matter one bit.</i>

Fix it, fucking dope.

<i>His run-ins with the law,
drunk driving convictions,</i>

<i>and his continued intravenous
drug problems made him a risk.</i>

<i>He was virtually uninsurable.</i>

<i>Damien, obviously devastated by
Grossman hideous casting choices,</i>

<i>seemed determined to remain optimistic.</i>

We got a lot' em.
We got Little Timid.

We got Commando.

There is also Holly Go Lightly.

I'm sitting up wind.

I'm sorry about that.
No, but the wind...

sometimes changes direction.
Let me go this way.

Yeah, but it still looping around,
hitting me in the face.

<i>In their search for
guaranteed box office success,</i>

<i>the ImagiCorp nonsensical
casting choices continued.</i>

<i>I was puzzled yet again,
when I overheard Damien bragging</i>

<i>about casting Al Pacino
for the role of Motown,</i>

<i>the black 19 year old from Detroit.</i>

<i>I later learned, that they were casting
the rapper, Alpa Chino,</i>

<i>singer of the hit single
"I Love Tha Pussy".</i>

Say hello to my little friend!

<i>In his contract with the ImagiCorp,</i>

<i>he was also promised
product placement in the film,</i>

<i>for his line Bust-A-Nut energy bars
and Booty Sweat energy drinks.</i>

I work with Tugg Speedman.
I love' em.

Thank you, Les Grossman,
for giving me the job.

<i>With Mr. Chino now playing Motown,
there was just one person left to cast,</i>

<i>Brooklyn.</i>

<i>Snatching the role was
a complete unknown,</i>

<i>Kevin Sandusky.
His only credit to date,</i>

<i>was a surprisingly touching
pharmaceutical commercial,</i>

<i>for a teenage erectyl dysfunction
medication, called Prom Night.</i>

<i>Five days away from
the first day of shooting,</i>

<i>and with his platoon finally in place,
Damien frustrations began to mount.</i>

<i>To encourage realism
and close bond with the actors,</i>

<i>Damien arranged
for a 5 day survival boot camp,</i>

<i>with Gulf War veteran,
Drake "The Stick" Longwood.</i>

<i>Sadly, only Sandusky
was eager to attend.</i>

Jesus fuck! Oh, fuck!

Sorry. Sorry, Damien, I'm sorry.

You better be fucking sorry,
because you're fucking dead.

Get down and give me fucking 50.
Can l take a break?

Get down, motherfucker, and do it.

Do what he says.
Who the fuck are you?

I am the director.

Oh, no! My God!
Damn.

<i>The boot camp experience itself</i>

<i>seemed to be an omen
of things to came.</i>

<i>Finally, the first day of filming
had arrived.</i>

<i>Damien spent the whole night prying,</i>

<i>putting the finishing touches
on the script.</i>

<i>He arrived on the set
in fantastic spirit.</i>

<i>The choppers had landed,
the effects team was in place,</i>

<i>the camera was ready.</i>

<i>Everything was going willingly.</i>

<i>Everything, except for the actors.</i>

<i>Lazarus refused even
to acknowledge Damien's presence,</i>

<i>unless he was wearing fatigues.</i>

<i>Sandusky, perhaps traumatized
by the boot camp, was acting erratic.</i>

<i>Alpa Chino refused to leave us alone,
believing we were a crew from MTV.</i>

That's MTV?
No. We just...

Yeah. Yo, we going to do
a small show, agree?

Check this out. Yours boy, Alpa Chino
doin' it real big. We're doing the same.

Deal every day on my new movie, Tropic
Thunder, you know how we do it, baby.

<i>He continually heckled us,
looking for free publicity.</i>

Damn, Booty Sweat from
Alpa Chino on sale soon.

<i>And Portnoy, sadly, was clearly
and actively still abusing narcotics.</i>

You go and get' em.

<i>Worst of all,</i>

<i>Speedman, was yet to even step
a foot outside his trailer.</i>

<i>Work came to a virtual standstill.</i>

<i>Finally, Damien was pressed
to do something about it.</i>

It's a fuck, it's a cunt.

Fucking 200,000 dollars
fucking breakfast.

This is ain't gonna be pretty.

Hey.
What's coming on?

Nothing, just dropping by,

to make sure the captain is shipshape.

What is that?

Desperate Housewives.
Alright.

You ever seen this show?
I know, I heard about it.

It's fucking awesome.
Oh yeah?

My girlfriend got me hooked.

Are you ready?
Kind of. I be right out.

OK. And get me the seasons
from Desperate Housewives.

Are you sure?
Yes, I'm hooked.

OK!
I only watching two minutes,

and I'm frigging hooked.
You will hate me.

I will hate you, if you
don't show up on the set.

Yeah. Fuck.

Yeah... I think that...

As David said to Goliath:

"I think we understand each other."
Oh, hey.

Are you...

They...
The Survivor is here?

The season one.
Call me, if you want season 2.

Don't hate me.
I don't.

Come here.

Just like Big Brother or something?

<i>After several hours of waiting,</i>

<i>Speedman finally emerged,
to commence work.</i>

Keep rolling, and go!

<i>However, when the cameras rolled,</i>

<i>it became apparent, that he yet
to learn any of his lines.</i>

<i>To all present, it was clear
that the press-on would be madness.</i>

<i>Lazarus seemed to be
at breaking point.</i>

We gonna be here all day,

all lookin' at you,
fucked up again. Alright, hotshot.

<i>By 4 o'clock, Speedman had cost
to production 1.6 million dollar.</i>

<i>Also, behind the scenes,</i>

<i>the cultural differences
between Vietnamese</i>

<i>and the American crew
began to bubble over.</i>

<i>Nowhere was this cultural divide
more clearly illustrated,</i>

<i>than in the mind of the film
special effects and stunt coordinator,</i>

<i>Cody Keith Underwood.</i>

What was this place like
before your came here? Was it...

This place was incredible. This is
an animal sanctuary here, first off,

and I believe, it's a sacred land. The
bush was thick, the wildlife was thick,

so it took us, maybe,

six or seven days, basically
just to get that shit out of here,

and just get it ready for what we are
doing. Something like that, right there.

I'm not trying to be dirty,
but that kind of stuff,

honestly, almost give me a boner...

There is Mother Nature, who is
obviously way bigger, than we are,

but here we are taking a piss on
Mother Nature face right here.

This is how we show, that we are human.

It's our instinct, to just

fucking crack out of it,
and beat her in the little mouth.

Look at that. Thats beautiful.

I don't know how long those
trees had been growing for...

But look what I'm fucking doing to him.

I win. I just beat nature today.

<i>What happened to the theme
of courage, heroism,</i>

<i>and arrogance
of America foreign policy?</i>

<i>Almost uniformly,
people seemed indifferent</i>

<i>to this subject matter altogether,
making idiotic statements,</i>

<i>that, from a P.R. perspective,
would do more harm than good.</i>

The only difference between this film
and Vietnam is that with this film,

we're gonna win.

<i>Day 2 started out even
worst than day 1.</i>

<i>Adding to the tension, the actual man,
"Four Leaf"Tayback</i>

<i>had traveled to Vietnam
for the first time in 30 years,</i>

<i>with the express purpose
to advising Speedman</i>

<i>on his POW scene.</i>

<i>I was just sitting down
to interview Four Leaf,</i>

<i>when my producer,
Friedrich, slipped me a note.</i>

<i>Tugg Speedman wanted to
participate in the interview.</i>

<i>It was the first time, when Tugg had
willingly sat down in front of my lens.</i>

<i>I was happy to accommodate.</i>

<i>It was also the first time
the two men had met.</i>

It's been extremely difficult to learn
how to use the hooks?

I am holding an espresso.

Four Leaf,

how hard has it been,
since you lost your hands?

When I lost these,

it was like I saw through

these, for the first time.

Then I begin to realize that,

I have never really used these.

And I'm trying to explain to him,

that he has to use something

in himself, somewhere.

I have to find another coffee.

This type, he looks like a Buddha.

I want to rub his belly for luck.

<i>Shortly after I turned off my camera
for these interviews,</i>

<i>some alarming news came over the wire.</i>

<i>A tropical typhoon
was threatening the coastline,</i>

<i>and was projected to slam hard
somewhere in the Southeast Asia.</i>

<i>By morning, the threat of typhoon
had became more dire.</i>

<i>The first signs of what was to came
began to show themselves.</i>

<i>Despite this, Damien whipping his crew
onward like sled dogs</i>

<i>demanded work continue.</i>

Mr. Cockburn, are we cutting?
No, we are still rolling.

Still rolling.
Still rolling.

<i>But by noon, the situation
was hopeless for the film.</i>

<i>Speedman fled to Hollywood
in his private plane.</i>

<i>Lazarus, again refusing
to drop character,</i>

<i>charted a C-130 cargo plane
to airlift himself, his fake family,</i>

<i>and thankfully,
myself and my crew,</i>

<i>back to his fake real hometown,
Galveston, Texas.</i>

<i>It was here that we chose
to raid out the storm.</i>

<i>But the storm had seemed
to had come to Texas with us.</i>

Hey, I heard that!

<i>Lazarus, more than ever,
did not seem himself.</i>

<i>He was acting erratic, refused to sleep,
and was suffering explosive outbursts.</i>

I'm the fucking king of the mountain!

You're crazy.
I'm crazy?

Damn! Holy shit.
What? Yeah?

<i>Something was terribly wrong.</i>

What we are seeing,
is an acute form of P.P.S.D.

I never heard of this.

I'm sorry. Post-Platoon Stress Disorder.

<i>The first documented case
was Charlie Sheen.</i>

<i>And when you have an actor,
like Mr. Lazarus...</i>

Hold on, don't move. We cool. What?

<i>...it would be unusual,
if he didn't suffer from this disorder.</i>

I gave you life.
I gave you a coat.

These fucking chips,
that's all me too, baby!

It's all my shit!
I run this shit!

<i>The same diagnose has been given
to Colin Farrell after "Tigerland",</i>

<i>Jim Caviezel after "Thin Red Line",</i>

<i>and incredibly, even Robin Williams
after shooting "Good Morning, Vietnam".</i>

<i>I was grateful at the end of it,</i>

<i>when we were able to return
to the madness of Vietnam.</i>

<i>Upon our return to Southeast Asia,
I was stunned.</i>

<i>Total devastation.</i>

<i>All the sets has been smashed,
like children's toothpicks,</i>

<i>and an entire battlefield
was washed in the Mekong river.</i>

<i>In just under two weeks
and five days of shooting,</i>

<i>the production had lost
almost 240 million dollar.</i>

<i>All that he showed for it,
was several discombobulated scenes</i>

<i>and a script, that was in ruin.</i>

<i>Les Grossman, in a rage,
called the accounting to say,</i>

<i>he was pulling the plug
the following morning.</i>

<i>Faced with such an impossible deadline,</i>

<i>there was little hope
in reviving the film.</i>

<i>Later that night, however,
in a brilliant move,</i>

<i>Damien did something
that was both politically sawy,</i>

<i>and economically feasible.
He courageously chose to shot</i>

<i>the most heartbreaking
and moving scene in the script.</i>

<i>It was Speedman's monologue.</i>

<i>Set it night, in a trench,</i>

<i>Four Leaf, knowing his man
an being led to the slaughter,</i>

<i>he is faced with the task of urging
his men not just to fight,</i>

<i>but to fight bravely and to the death.
If Damien could pulled off,</i>

<i>Les Grossman would certainly see
the film Oscar potential,</i>

<i>and loosen the purse strings yet again.</i>

<i>Damien seemed calm.</i>

<i>The mood, by contrast,
was thick with anticipation.</i>

Four Leaf comes in and talks to them,
almost like a Christ-like figure,

if I could say that.
Yes, you can.

He is an almost Christ-like figure then.
I said that.

There is a wonderful speech
where he said:

"Death is, but a moment.

Cowardice is a lifetime of affliction."

The idea, that death being
a moment, is just...

both terrifying and yet
strangely comforting.

Just be discreet. He knows
that we maybe coming. Follow me.

Hey, don't mind the guys,
they just covering, so...

Reality show.
Reality show.

I wanted to talk to you...
Okay, okay.

...About the speech.
Shoot, daddy.

I was wondering, maybe you could
skip some of my lines I got,

some of the other guys.
Because it feels a little bit like...

I don't know, it's a little bit talky.
You hear me?

Yeah, it's a lot of words, but...

I liked you to say:
"Death spring not from darkness.

Yet be not afraid gentlemen,
for hope is its handmaiden.

Do not fear death,
because death is only a moment.

Cowardice is a lifetime of affliction."

That's what I am saying.
For me, I know my audience understand.

They don't understand words,
like "affliction" and "cowardish".

It's cowardice.
What is that mean?

What do you mean?
It's like a female coward.

Not "cowardess", it's cowardice.

Cowardess?
I-C-E, ice...

Okay, but you're understand
that while we have this conversation,

I gonna get popcorn and take a piss.

Oh, boy.

You know, it should be like:
"Look, we are going out there, right?

We gonna... kick some ass, right."

Or should be like:
"Tomorrow is gonna suck.

Suck up and deal.

Cock the gun.

Don't say it, do it. Maggots.

Over and out."

High five. Don't say it, do it.

I...
"Over and out".

I don't know, what that means.
"Over and out"?

That we say on walkie-talkie,
when we finished talking.

No, sorry. Excuse me.
I know what "Over and out" means.

Yeah, it's something
that everybody knows.

Fucking cunt!

<i>The following morning,
after a fruitless night of shooting,</i>

<i>Damien had become uncooperative.</i>

I don't care no more.
You're part of the machine.

You're part of the machine.

You think you are outside,
but you're part of the machine.

Deal with it, dude.
I don't give a shit. So...

<i>He seemed to be almost totally unhinged.</i>

Shoot that.

Put that ass as an attachment,
and send it as an email to Les Grossman.

<i>- Good night, Vienna.
But in moments of this exchange,</i>

<i>word came down, that
Les Grossman had pulled the plug.</i>

So, it's finally over.

No, it's not over.

This is just the beginning.

This is just the beginning.

<i>These cryptic words
would come back to haunt me.</i>

<i>In what would be
my final interview with him,</i>

<i>it was clear that something inside
of Damien had completely shattered.</i>

I am in a place, now, which is...

Umm, it's a place of total clarity.

I don't feel anger, I feel just...

Love, perhaps.
I feel... Yeah, I feel love.

I don't bear any kind of...

Resentment.
Resentment or grudge...

I am calm and I feel united...
With yourself.

Yeah, but let me fucking finish.
Interrupting me, Jesus!

Anyway, I am feeling better.

<i>Damien was anything but feeling better.</i>

<i>Early the next morning
roused from my slumber,</i>

<i>I received urgent and terrible news.</i>

What? What is it?

<i>Damien and the cast
had gone missing.</i>

What?

<i>The greatest fear of
every documentarian,</i>

<i>is that they themselves
will become their own subject,</i>

<i>but with this new developments,
I had no choice.</i>

<i>I leaped into action,
and hatched an action plan.</i>

<i>Find Damien and the cast.</i>

<i>They were last seen boarding a chopper,
that had flown in a north-west direction</i>

<i>into one of the most lethal and
dangerous part of Southeast Asia.</i>

<i>We had many kilometers to cover,
and the jungle would be unforgiving.</i>

<i>However, by nightfall,
we had made faint signs of progress.</i>

We just come across this,
which appears to be some blood.

I going to touch it.

I don't like touching things,
it's dirty, but i am going through.

Yes, thats blood. I will try it.

Yes, it's blood.
Taste like iron.

<i>Two more hours
we trekked through the jungle,</i>

<i>and just when we were about
to turn ourselves back,</i>

<i>we came across the most
tantalizing piece of evidence so far.</i>

Looks like a video recorder.

There is a tape inside.
It's very exciting.

<i>I returned to the hotel with pits
in my stomach, eager to play the tape.</i>

<i>Damien was indeed on the tape,
and so was the rest of the actors.</i>

<i>But also there was something
so shocking and so awful</i>

<i>that I questioned whether
my eyes were actually lying to me.</i>

<i>Worst of all, it had actually
happened to human beings.</i>

<i>The thought, that people
had experienced this,</i>

<i>made me question life, God,
humanity and the point of living.</i>

<i>Several weeks after shooting,
I even became suicidal.</i>

This is probably the single most

disturbing,

awful and disgusting film I ever seen.

I watch it one more time.

<i>Let's go, and make
the greatest war movie ever!</i>

<i>- Yeah!
Yeah!</i>

<i>Yes!</i>

<i>And watched again, I did.</i>

What is important, it's not the amazing
footage, which you will never see,

but instead the lives of artists
who tried to make Tropic Thunder.

<i>I remember them as the
human beings they were,</i>

<i>not the grotesque pieces
of human remains they become.</i>

<i>What is it, that drove Damien
to the edge of lunacy?</i>

<i>Why did the cast sabotaged itself?</i>

<i>And finally, what about Hollywood,
the land of false promises?</i>

What is the answer
to all of these questions?

I will never tell you.

What I have showed you,
is in the end, the truth.

Not this spoon-fed
Hollywood version of it.

This time, unlike Hollywood,
you must decide for yourself,

what is real and what is illusion.

But be warned, you may
find yourself a prisoner to Hollywood,

and it's torrential rain of madness.

From out of the dark
is the South Central g., ready

hand steady on a bloody machete.

A devil is on my shoulder.
Should I kill it? Hell, yeah!

I slice Jack, took an ax,
and gave that bitch, Jill, forty wacks.

With my hip-hop, it don't stop,

until heads roll off the cutting block.
