â™ª Put your hair up in the air â™ª

-â™ª Live it up â™ª
-â™ª Hey! â™ª

â™ª Everyday you wake up singing â™ª

-â™ª Turn it up â™ª
-â™ª Woo! â™ª

â™ª The party's just beginning â™ª

â™ª All together, you and me â™ª

â™ª Hair in the air, we're a family â™ª

â™ª We got everything we need â™ª

â™ª Hair in the air cos we're proud to be â™ª

â™ª Celebrating who we are â™ª

â™ª Yeah we made it through the dark â™ª

â™ª Harmony is everywhere,
Put your hair up in the air â™ª


â™ª Put your hair up in the air â™ª

this has been a strange day.

What was supposed to be
a harmonious pillow harvest

led to an all-out pillow war,

which got a tiny bit out of hand.

[Troll monster roars]
[Trolls scream]

But when we discovered a mysterious box,

we realized the craziness had just begun.

It's a wooden chest filled with Troll wigs
and masks of us.

And look, some sort of journal,
detailing our habits and routines.

That's silly.

Why would anyone hide a box like that
out here in the middle of nowhere?

I'll tell you why.

Because someone's pretending to be a Troll
to spy on us.

There's an imposter in our midst.

And based on this journal,

I'd say he or she is learning
our weaknesses,

maybe to steal something,
or maybe lead a full-scale invasion!

There's not an imposter.

This is Branch, remember?

He's always spouting off
paranoid conspiracy theories.

No, I don't.

Satin is actually Chenille.
They were switched at birth.

The Man in the Moon
is actually a little boy fishing.

The birds have formed an alliance.
They're teaming up against us.

[Trolls roar with laughter]

You'll regret this!

And remember that time he told us
eating too much sugar

would make our teeth fall out?

What a kook!

Oh, that was for real?

Oh, Mr. Dentist!

Guys, I'm not paranoid!

This is clearly
a hidden chest of disguises

that someone
didn't want us knowing about.

You say "chest of disguises".
I say "emergency costume party box".

An emergency costume party box?

Who on earth
would have something like that?

-I do!
-[female Troll] Oh, I do!

-[Smidge] Yeah!
-[male Troll] Oh, me!

I don't know, guys.

As much as I like teasing Branch,

it is strange that someone
would hide their costume box

all the way out here.

Yeah, we all enjoy mocking Branch.

But that journal is awfully weird.
Maybe we should hear him out.

OK, we can do that,

or we can forget about it and sing a song!

Sing a song!

But--

-â™ª Just look around you â™ª
-[Trolls]  â™ª Ooh ah! â™ª

-â™ª  The blue sky's shining  â™ª
-[Trolls]  â™ª Ooh ah! â™ª

-â™ª Love surrounds you â™ª
-[Trolls]  â™ª Ooh ah! â™ª

â™ª  [Poppy]  Your friends are smiling â™ª

â™ª Yeah â™ª

-â™ª  Every day our dreams come true  â™ª
-[Trolls] â™ª  Ooh ooh ooh ooh... Woo!  â™ª

â™ª Life is great, life is grand â™ª

â™ª Don't listen to Branch!
Don't listen to Branch! â™ª

â™ª We're celebrating â™ª

-â™ª We party all night â™ª
-[Trolls]  â™ª Ooh ah! â™ª

-[Poppy]  â™ª There's no debating â™ª
-[Trolls]  â™ª Ooh ah! â™ª

â™ª True colours shine bright, yeah! â™ª

â™ª  Got non-stop fun, hugs on demand  â™ª
-[Trolls]  â™ª Ahh ahh... Woo!  â™ª

-â™ª Life is great â™ª
-[Branch] â™ª  Just quiet down â™ª

-â™ª Life is grand â™ª
-[Branch]  â™ª You're way too loud â™ª

â™ª Don't listen to Branch â™ª

â™ª Don't listen to Branch â™ª

-[Poppy]  â™ª Celebrate â™ª
-[Branch]  â™ª I'm on defence â™ª

â™ª Sing and dance â™ª
-[Branch]  Oh, it's common sense â™ª

â™ª Don't listen to Branch â™ª

â™ª Don't  listen to Branch!
Never listen to Branch! â™ª

Ah, my chakras are realigned.


Haha! Great song, guys.

Never forget. Life is great!

Poppy, are you OK?

Life is not great, Branch.
There's an imposter in our midst.

What? What happened to
"emergency costume party box"?

Emergency costumes of other Trolls?

Get your head out of the clouds.
I said that to put everyone at ease.

But you accused me of being paranoid.

You... You sang an entire song
assailing my character.

I had to really sell it.

I didn't want anyone to freak out.

And Trolls have a long history
of freaking out.

-[dance music]
-[Trolls cheer and giggle]

-Ooh, we've run out of glitter.
-[music stops]

So it's up to us to find this imposter

and make sure
he or she doesn't mean us any harm.

And I think I know where we can do it...


The can't-miss event of Picnic Week.

-Everyone will be here.
-Meep.

The imposter is likely wearing a wig,

so we just need to give everyone
a little hair tug on the down-low

to find out who's pretending,

assuming he or she
is still here in the village.

Oh, they are.

No-one goes to all the trouble
of making something like this

and then leaves without it.

Here, I wrote down every Troll's name.

We'll each take half
and won't stop until every head is tugged.

Every head?

-Ow!
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

You're clear.

Oh, Biggie, it's SO good to see you.

Uh... Ow!

OK. Gotta go!

Well, that was odd.

Man, I'm beat.

Hmm?

Hmm.

Got my second wind!

-Oh, no. You have a bug in your hair.
-Ow!

-Now yours.
-Ow.

and offer them a hug â™ª

â™ª Then grab their hair
and give a firm tug! â™ª


â™ª I give those tugs
about a five out of ten â™ª

â™ª So just for good measure,
yank 'em all again! â™ª

-Ow!
-What the...!

What's that, Aspen?

You think you can beat Smidge
in a hair tug-of-war?

-I didn't say that.
-What?

Oh, you are going down, boy!


What's that, you five other Trolls?

You think you can beat Smidge
in a hair tug-of-war?

No way!

-It's on, punks!
-[they scream]

[Smidge cries out]

Hey, Fuzzbert, slap me some hair.

-[Fuzzbert grunts and groans]
-[Branch screams]

-[beeping]
-Huh?


-[beeping]
-Uh...

Oh!

No imposter is worth all this.

Branch, buddy,
boy, have I got something to show you.

Sorry, Archer. I'm kind of busy.

Oh. But what if I told you
saw someone suspicious?

I'd say show me. Immediately.

-What if I said it was someone mysterious?
-I'd still want to see it.

-Shadowy and strange?
-[Branch] Archer!

Oh, sorry. Got excited. Follow me.

-[Branch] What the...!
-[THUD]

[muffled shouts]

-Troll, Troll...
-Ow!

-Ow!
Bergen!

Ah. Darn. You got me. I'm up again.

Troll, Troll, Troll.

Well, none of you are wearing wigs.

I don't think you understand this game
at all.

-Branch...any luck?
-Gah

Oh. Poppy. Uh...no.

Actually I was just following Archer,

looking for someone
"shadowy and mysterious".

-Turns out it was his shadow.
-Ow.

-Poppy, what if there is no imposter?
-What?

Well, maybe we should try
looking at this more...optimistically.

Whoa! Sorry.

You being optimistic,
my whole world just turned upside down.

Very funny.

Seriously,
maybe I was being paranoid earlier.

Yes, the box we found is really weird,
but Troll Village is a weird place.

-[firework squeals]
-[Trolls cheer]

I guess what I'm trying to say is:

â™ª Life is great,
so don't listen to Branch â™ª

â™ª Don't listen to Branch!
Don't listen to Branch! â™ª

Well, that was odd.

But, yeah, he's right.
Look at all the great stuff happening:

Trolls relaxing, Trolls sunbathing,

Branch tied up, Trolls playing games...
WAIT, WHAT?

IMPOSTER!

[laughs... gasps]

[Grunts... falls silent]

[Trolls scream and gasp]


But how are you...? I just...

Archer Pastry took the journal
and tied me up.

He's not a Troll.

He is a master of disguise
and could be any one of you.

Oh my guh!

Imposter!

It's happening: the freak out.

Take shelter behind me, children!

-No way. You might be the imposter.
-Yeah? Well, you might be the imposter!

Or you. How about you?
I'm not the imposter, you're the imposter!

[they scream]

-It could be anyone.
-It could be you.


You're the imposter!

You give one-armed side hugs.
What kind of Troll does that?

-Argh!
-Meep!

After all we've been through.


There's a shape-shifter.
He's here to take our souls!

[steady tapping]

Trolls, there may come a day
when our courage fails,

when we stop partying
and make that face Branch makes sometimes,

like an upside-down smile.

It... See? That one. Right there.

But today is not that day.

Today we work together
to find this imposter. Got it?

Yeah!

Tell us what we should do, Poppy!

Turn to the Troll next to you
and pull each other's hair.

-For the village!
-Ow!

Ow! Ow! Ow!


Oh, I laugh so I don't cry.


What? No, I'm not!

Not that Aspen Heitz. This Aspen Heitz.

He won't let me pull his hair.

Total mind-bender. Whoa.

-[Gasps] It's Branch.
-[Trolls gasp]

-Guys! That's not the real me!
-[Guy] Oh right. Right.

-[yelps]
-[Trolls gasp]

-I can't take this.
-[Mr. Dinkles] Meep.

Argh! Uh! Ya! Huh!

-Meep!
-Urgh!

-Ya!
-What a kook!

-Huh!
-Ow! That's actually me.

Well, you did it. You caught the imposter.

So what do you wanna do with him?

I want some answers.

So,

tell me everything.

[drum roll]


We know you're not a Troll,
and...we know you've been spying on us.

What we need to know now...

is why.

Hm. The silent treatment, eh?

Fine. We have ways of making you talk...

called Icebreaker Questions!

[Trolls cheer]

Biggie, if you could travel the world
with three people,

who would it be?

-[Trolls murmur]
-Mr. Dinkles, uh...Mr. Dinkles...

Uh...

and Mr. Dinkles.

Satin, what's your worst habit?

Well, I lose my toothbrush a lot,

so I use Chenille's.

[Trolls laugh]

OK, Archer, name five things
you'd take with you on a desert island.

[gentle piano music]


Well, gee, if you really mean that,
I guess I'd say...



Oh... Oh, you Trolls!

You should see the looks on your faces!

Oh, seriously, you need to see this.

-Does anybody have a camera?
-Ooh, I do.

No, Biggie, don't.

You actually gave me one!

-Bravo, Trolls, bravo!
-[Smidge growls]

Oh, man, all my friends are gonna have
a field day with this place. Wooh.

Friends? What friends?

Oh, no, are the widdle twolls confused?

Fine, I'll explain.

I was spying on you because I'm a scout.

A scout? For who?

We'll want his statement on record.
Scrapbook this down.

First of all, you're right.
We're not Trolls.

In fact,
we're distant cousins of the Bergens.


Some call us marauders.

But we prefer the name The Party Crashers!

[party crashers] Wooh! Wooh!

only caring about one thing,

where we're gonna throw down next.

[Trolls scream]


until we've drained the land
of its party resources,

and then we move on to the next bash.

See? Real fun happens when you don't care
about the consequences.

So you just show up out of nowhere,
and use up everyone's party supplies?

-And without RSVP-ing?
-[Trolls gasp]


And when I escape,
oh, and I will escape,

I'll lead my friends here

to the best-supplied party hot spot
of all time,

Troll Village.

[thunder crackles]


then, who knows,
maybe I could direct them somewhere else.

Oh, so sell out someone else
to save our own hair?

Not on my watch, pal.

Ooh! Not on my watch, pal.

-Stop that.
-Stop that.

-I'm serious.
-I'm serious.

I'm... [laughs]

OK, I see what you're doing here.


Yeah, he's not gonna get angry.

I AM!

Smidge, is this really necessary?

That depends.

Do you want Archer dining
on a Smidge fist casserole?

-Um...
-Then yes.

OK, listen up, guys.

If we wanna make sure
Archer stays locked up,

so he can't lead the Party Crashers here,

we need a guard rotation.

Forgive how crude this presentation is.
I made it on the fly.

As you can see, I broke us
into groups of six by birth date,

not alphabetic order cos, duh, right?

-Anyway, if you look here--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Easy there, schedule nerd.

-We're not keeping Archer locked up
-We're not?

Of course not.

If Archer's locked in there,
and we're out here,

how can we be friends?

Friends?

If we make him our buddy,
we protect Troll Village.

Poppy, no one can make that guy our buddy.


Guys, we can make any enemy into a friend,
we've just gotta

find a way to win him over.

Archer, I'm gonna need you to follow me.

It's time you faced the music.

Huh?

Happy Archer Pastry Day!

[Trolls cheer]

[dance music]

Let me guess.

You created a holiday in my honour
to persuade me to be your friend?

Oh, Trolls.
Oh, this is sad. It's just so sad.

See? He's just going to use this
to push our buttons.

I bet you'll change your tune when you see
the super thoughtful gift we got you!

Really?
Well, in that case, I'll just have to

re-gift it.

[cries out]

Your move.

Hi, we're the improv team,
The Split Ends,

your Archer Pastry Day entertainment.

To get started, we need a suggestion
of a thing from our guest of honour.

Poop!

Oh.

Uh, what about something
a little more fun?

-Like clowns.
-OK, a clown.

Made out of poop!

the suggestion of a place?

-Poopville.
-[Trolls sigh]

And scene.

Time for the Archer Pastry Day Anthem.

-And a one, and a two and a--
-17, 11, one million six!

Honour him by ignoring him.

Three point one four one five
nine two six five three--

â™ª [Trolls]  Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh  â™ª

â™ª I see those walls
I wanna break 'em down â™ª

â™ª So I can know you inside and out â™ª

â™ª If you just take a chance,
And believe in your friends â™ª

â™ª I can show you how â™ª

â™ª Let me feel the rhythm of your heart â™ª

â™ª Let me see inside your soul â™ª

â™ª If you open up your eyes you'll find â™ª

â™ª There's a friend outside your door â™ª

â™ª There's a friend â™ª

â™ª outside your door â™ª

[Archer sniffs]

Archer? Are you...crying?

What? No.

I just never heard
a song like that before. It...

-It... It was...
-Touching?

Ugh, no. Stop.

Why is everyone looking at me?
Don't... Don't look at me!

See? It's working.

Won't be long now
until Archer is a true friend.

-[wind howls]
-Archer? Archer?

[Archer laughs]

Later Trolls.

He's gonna get away!

He'll lead the Party Crashers right to us!

It's OK. I've been preparing
for something like this.

Scramble the jet critters!

[alarm wails]

It's game time!

-I'll serve up the sundae.
-And I'll put the cherry on top.

and these guys are the best of the best.

[Branch sighs]
Which is still not very good.

[Archer laughs]

[laughing wildly]

-[Poppy gasps]
-[they grunt]

Archer, come back right now.

Or what?

I know all your weaknesses.

Queen Poppy declared a cannonball contest!

[Trolls cheer]

-Cannonball!
-[Trolls] Cannonball!

-[Trolls] Cannonball!
-[Poppy and Branch scream]


[Branch and Poppy scream]


Don't worry. I'll be back, Trolls.
With friends!

Well, that's it.
Troll Village is done for.

No. We still have one move left.

-Now we're talking.
-Ready the Smidge for launch!




Huh? [screams]

-[Smidge growls in water]
-[Archer screams]

[Trolls cheer]

Hey, we caught Archer. High-five!

Yeah. Whoo-hoo.

-What's wrong?
-[sighs]

I guess we can't make any enemy
our friend.

Poor Twolls.

Did I ruin your dweam
of making me your fwend?

Oh. I'm so sowwy.

You gonna cwy? Huh?

Gonna shed wittle tears to think of me
locked up in here all alone, aw...

Wait. What?

Hey! It's about time you showed up!

Branch? What are you doing here?

It's our shift to spend time with Archer.

Like you said, we can't become friends
with him if we're out there.

So Branch decided groups of us
should take turns

spending time with him in here.

Yep, I worked it all out
on my friendship rotation, see?

Because we can make any enemy our friend.

It just might take more than one day.

Pfft. A day?
I can do a day with you Trolls.

Or, it might take a week.

-I can do a week.
-Or a month.

It could take a whole lifetime
of Troll positivity,

but we will make you our friend.

No! No! Noooo!
