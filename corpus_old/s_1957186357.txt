Do you...

Do you not know that your bodies

are temples of the holy spirit?

Who is in you.
[eerie music]

Whom you have received from God.

You, [clears throat] you are not
your own.

You were bought, you
were bought at a price.

Therefore, honor God with your
bodies.

There will be terrible
times in the last days.

People will be lovers of
themselves, lovers of money.

Boastful.

Proud.

Abusive.

Treacherous, rash, conceited.

Lovers of- lovers of-

Lovers of pleasure rather
than lovers of God.

Having a form of Godliness
but denying its power

Have nothing- have nothing
to do with such people.

They are the kinds [clears
throat] who worm their way

into homes and gain control
over gullible women.

[woman sings]

not fear,

though the earth give way

and the mountains fall
into the heart of the sea,

though its waters roar and foam

and the mountains quake
with their surging.

Glad the city of God,

the holy place where
the Most High dwells."

[eerie music]
[muffled chatter and singing]

[door slams]

"He breaks the bow and shatters
the spear.

He burns the shields with fire.

For persecution or famine
or nakedness or sword.

As it is written.

For your sake we face death all
day long.

We are considered as
sheep to be slaughtered."

purpiceps.

The dark-purplish buds
on this head of wheat

are the so-called sclerotia of
sordico,

from the genus purpiceps.

This indicates the beginning
of the sexual stage...

[motorcycle engine roars]

Once winter is over,
the sordico will sprout

to mushroom-like structures,

which will create the sexual
spore stage,

which takes place throughout
the spring season.

This stage will be discharged

from the fruit bodies
by the fungus and dicem-

I've got purpose, Jim,
god damn it. [clear throat]

I've got purpose, Jim, god damn
it.

I've got purpose, god damn it,
Jim.

[clears throat]

Give me...

Damn it, Jim!

Give me a fucking chance!

Damn it, Jim, give me a, give me
a fu-

[Narrator] After the
infection takes hold,

the asexual spore stage is
created.

This is called the purpolia
stage,

which creates its spores in a
honeydew-

A fucking chance!
[tense music]

Just give me a fucking chance!


caused by sordico of wheat

is referred to as sordicism.

There are two types of
symptoms that can occur

in cases of serious poisoning.

[driver sighs]


sordicism

is common in grazing farm
animals.

It causes gangrene to
occur by constricting

the blood vessels that
lead to the extremities.

Convulsive sordicism is
characterized

by disfunction within the
nervous system,

where the animal twists and
contorts its body in pain.

Trembling and shaking.
[driver whispers]

Typically, when a bovid
becomes infected by sordico,

it must be put down,

and the entire crops from
that season destroyed.

Symptoms of gangrenous
and convulsive sordicism

can occur in varying degrees
in any animal or human

who has consumed sordico.

In the Middle Ages, unaware of
the risks,

the common folk of Europe
rarely made the effort

to remove the sordico from the
wheat,

so the fungal wheat flour was
often baked into the bread.

There are extensive accounts
of these ignorant peasants

suffering from burning
sensations in their limbs,

amputations due to gangrene,

dizziness, nausea, and,

if consumed over a long period
of time, gradual insanity.

These symptoms were titled Godly
flames,

as many considered them
a punishment from God.

A tribulation for the sins of
the people.

Do you know how to get to

Big weirdy weirdo.

No idea.

Pardon my French,

but I didn't come all the way
down here

to Albuquerque to get fucked.

To get fucked, bucko.

Hey, Jim.

Remember that night in Vegas,

when we met those two broads at
Caesar's?

Well, there's something I never
told you.

There's somethin'...

Hey, Jim.

I'm sorry and please pardon my
French,

but I just get nervous around
cool guys,

and when I got on that plane, I
just-

You hate me.

Hm?

I've just been crazy
pre-occupied.

It's fine.

I swear, it's fine.

I swear, I swear, I swear.

You hate me.

Yes.

I 100% don't hate you, it's
totally fine.

We're both distracted right now.

I repulse you.

I totally get it.



[distant owl hoots]

Hell of a haunch.

Thanks to you.

Yeah, that's what eating raw

and burning 35,000 calories
a month will get you.

Yeah, that and a stomach full
of acid.

Did you take your-

Yes!
All right.

Rylie?

Sorry!

What the fuck?
I'm sorry!

[engine roars]

Hello?

Hello?

Hello?
Hello?


Yeah, what the-

Shh.

Yeah, who is, who's there?


Can we help you?


[Rylie sighs]

Oh, great.

[tense music]

[zipper unfastens]

Sorry if I scared ya!



Between Cedar and Hillside.

Oh, you're kidding.

Nope...

Two of you in there?


there?

Yeah?

So, do we need to pack up?

Yeah.

All right.

What, what's your name?


What, what was that?

Eulis!

I, I can't-

E-U-L-I-S.

Oh, Eulis.

Do you know anything that
might be open this late?

Like a motel or...

[distant creaks]

[hurried footsteps]

Not right in town that I can
think of.

There might be something further
north.

[hurried footsteps]

Might be something further
north.

Okay.

Thanks.

I'll come back around,
next couple hours.

Make sure you're outta here.

Yeah, we'll be out in a bit.

Make sure to douse that fire.

Yeah, will do!

Get home safe.

Yeah, thank you.

[dark abstract music]

[engine roars]

[distant owl hoots]

We're probably gonna have
to drive out a couple miles

before we get any service,

but I think I can get
us into town on my own.

[engine turns]

Nope.

Fucking nope.

Sam.
[engine churns]

Fucking nope!

Sam!

Did you leave the hazards on?

Did I leave the hazards on?

[percussive vocal music]

Once we get to the main road
that should bring us into town.

Worst case, we call AAA from
there.

Be home by five AM.

worst case.

Oh, that's the spirit.

I have 47% battery, how much do
you have?

30.

Is it on low power?
Yes.

All other apps-
All apps are off.

down?

Whoa, what the...

Jesus Christ.

What the fuck?

[suspenseful music]

We couldn't just do a nice day
hike, nope.

Will you just give it a rest,
Sam?

[Sam mumbles to himself]
Just, will you shut up?

Excuse me?
Just shut up.

Wait.

Sam?

It's okay, I forgive you!

Idiot.

Nice.

Look.
What?

There.


No, the darkness surrounding
the light.

God, come on.

I'm something tonight?

[woman hums melodically]
[jaunty music from TV]

Not to mention the five-
Shh!

If you shush me one more-
Just shh!

[bulb crackles]


What's that smell?

[door creaks]

Hi!
Oh, hi there.

Hi.

We're so sorry to bother you.

We were just wondering if we
could maybe borrow your phone?

See, we were camping a little
ways in, near the wheat fields

and the land owner told
us that we had to leave.


Yeah, so we were all set to
drive home,

and then our car wouldn't
start and we weren't able

to track down any cell service.

[distant owl hoots]

So, we were wondering if
maybe we could use your phone

to call AAA for a jump?

Hi, I'm Sam.

Hi, Sam.

Should...

Oh, please, please!

Where are my manners?

Ah, thank you so much.


Hi, Sam.
Hi.

I'm Karen.
Hi, Karen.

[door slams]

AAA won't do you any good over
here.

Take 'em two-three hours just to
get here.

Not worth it just for a jump.

Now, my neighbor, Pete, he
could be here in 30 minutes.

Settle for a T-bone steak

and a glass of milk for
compensation. [chuckles]

Wouldn't have to spend a nickel.

That'd be great.

Are you sure that he's
awake? It's already-

Pete?

Karen.

I've got a sweet couple here.

Had their camping trip wrecked

by some scum sucker over by...

Did you get his name?

Eulis.

You-us?

Eulis.

E-U-L-I-S.

Oh, Eulis. [chuckles]

You know a, a Eulis?

Eulis.

Eulis!

[oil sizzles]
[jaunty music from TV]

Oh, okay.

Okay.

Okay.

So I'll see you in a bit.

See ya in a bit!

And if you've got your teeth in,

I'll fix ya a cut and a fresh
loaf.


All right, my dear.

[dark percussive music]

Did he say how long he might
be?

Eulis?

Pete.

Oh!

Pete.

We don't wanna overstay.
Oh, please, please, please.

He shouldn't be more than 30
minutes.

Worst case, 45, since he's
gettin' on.

No, that's great, that's
perfect.

Perfect. [chuckles]

[dark percussive music]

[radiator rattles]

Again, thank you so...

[oven buzzes]

Oh, my goodness!

Where are my manners?

You two must be stravin'!

Actually, a little.

Actually, I think we're fine.

Oh, you're a couple of sticks.

Come on, come on!

Come on, Rylie.

You're a stick.

[Rylie sighs]

[siren wails on TV]

Oh dear, oh dear.

I always overshoot at low heat.

Is there any spinach in the
house?

[dark abstract music]

["Pop! Goes the Weasel"]

It gets so hot when I cook,
so I leave it open. [chuckles]

Have a seat!

[Sam gasps]

Hello.

Hi.

[siren wails on TV]

[door squeaks]

[door closes]


Sit down. [chuckles]

Have somethin' for ya in 10-15
minutes.



You like steak?

Oh, Sam is actually off
red meat as of recently, so-

Well, I, I-
How do you like 'em?

No, I'm sorry, he's
actually off red meat.

I had a physical a few months
ago

and my cholesterol is not great.


Doctor suggested that I-
He can't have any red meat.

Any dairy, sugar, salt.

Maybe a little piece of
chicken once a month, but that-

A quarter chicken once a
month.

He suggested-
You can't have it.

[man sneezes]
Bless you.

And I'm actually a
vegan, believe it or not.

[Karen sighs]
[eerie music]

[door slams]
[Karen chuckles]

Oh, boy.

I take a three and a half,
but an eight feels so good.

I've gotta get 12s.

Oh, [chuckles] perfect.

[Karen chuckles]

Do you need some help?

Where's your restroom?
What?

Take a left out of the
kitchen,

then a right before the stairs.

[Karen chuckles]

[Karen hums softly]
[somber music]

[oil sizzles]

[ominous tones]

So, were you at all
affected by the sordico?

[Karen hums softly]

Karen?

Hey, Karen?
What's that, dear?

affected by the sordico,

a little while back?

The sordico?

The cattle deaths, from
the Sordico of wheat?

Oh, right, right.

The sordico. [chuckles]

How do you know about all that?

I'm getting my doctorate in
botany.

I'm doing my thesis
project on the resurgence

of sordico in New England crops

and their life cycle in
this particular climate.

Must've really disrupted
the industry over here.

At least the meat trade.

Oh, [chuckles] sure, sure.

We were one of the top meat and
wheat farmers in the county.


Now we trade with the farmer
nearby.

Our veggies for his meat and
grain.

Have you ever considered
moving?

[knife thuds]
[dark percussive music]

You like cardamom?

Love it.

[Karen sniffles]

Sorry.

Did something happen?

I love Christmas music.

[corn crunches]

[laughter from TV]

[Sam and Karen laugh]

So, is Pete pretty close, you
think?

Sam, would you like some-
Hey, Karen?

You think that Pete is pretty
close?

fast.

Wouldn't say more than another
30.

He's gettin' on.

He may look like a chunky monkey
now,

but he used to come in at an
even 400.

Who's that, Pete?

Gunni.

My son.

Got kicked.
[Gunni grunts]

By a bull, about six months ago.

Right in the face.

Hasn't been the same.

God, I'm sorry.

Oh. [chuckles]

A little butter won't hurt him.

Thank you.

Left, right, left, right,
left, right.

So, what do you do, Sam?
Well, I'm, uh-

He's an actor.


Waiter/actor.
Actor/waiter.

In between waiting jobs.

He's just getting too many
auditions.

Can never remember the
specials.

I've got the same problem with
scripts.

[Karen and Sam laugh]

Well, this weekend, he's
my research assistant.

[Karen chuckles]

Was that your bear trap out in
the woods?

[distorted chatter from tape]

Hey, Karen?

Oh, come on, buggy boy, just a

Baked 'em yesterday!

Oh, I'm stuffed.

Yeah, me too, thank you.

[Gunni slurps]

Oh, Sam.


[camera snaps]

Sorry again, about Pete.

He tends to fall asleep,
just outta nowhere.

Even in the middle of
conversations, sometimes.

Like a narcoleptic?
Nope.

don't mind just calling for-

Oh and if you get a
hankerin' for anything,

go back upstairs!

There's plenty of leftov-.
[distant clunks]

[suspenseful music]

That's our dog, Earl.

We keep him in the barn, a
little ways in.

Bad with people.

There's no, uh, online or
phone service over here,

but if you're desperate,

you might try a little
further in, that a way.

Cellular phone wise.

I think some sorta
tower might reach there.

right.

Gunni usually sleeps down
here.

I'll keep him up with me
tonight.


You know, maybe we should
just...



Right this way.

Sam.

Right this way.


Got your own bathroom back
there.

You even have a TV. [chuckles]

Think we had a couple of...

[static hisses]

Oh! [chuckles]


your hospitality, Karen.

You've really saved our butts.

â™ª Oh my honey, yes, oh my honey,
yes â™ª

Yeah, really. Thank you
for everything, Karen.

â™ª To the leader man, rag and
music man â™ª

â™ª Oh my honey, what, oh my
honey, what â™ª

Sounds like a cricket got in.

[clears throat]

I'll call Pete, first thing.

If he doesn't haul over in 15,

I'll snag his cables myself.

We really appreciate it.
Yeah, thanks again, Karen.

Nighty night. [chuckles]

â™ª Come on along. I'm goin' along
â™ª

â™ª Come on along. I'm goin' along

Rylie.

Sam.

We are livin' in a... [coughs]

Livin' in a time of tribulation.

Eul', darnit with that!

To put it simply.

We have perverted God's divine
love,

through abuse of his gifts.

[Gunni sneezes]

We were overindulgent in God's
feed,

and so he took it away.

Forcing us to seek a
more immediate source,

so that he may not forsake
us in the end times,

which, my babies, are
nearer than you may think.

But we have been given an
opportunity for absolution.

A second chance to sustain life
entirely

through consumption of what we
can access

of our own flesh and available
earth,

so we may be judged in his
image.

Now, that's what I call mercy.

So...

Came up with a sorta
redemption-type program.

A rationing effort.

We've had a number of
participants

over the years.

I think we've worked out all the
kinks.

Just about.

This little sweetheart's
been with us for a while now.


[eerie music]

If there was ever someone
who needed a good sortin'...

Quite the pig. [chuckles]

But from his gluttony,

we were blessed with two cheeks

and a beefy round.

[Gunni screams]

He's also taught us a heck
of a lot about perseverance.

And loyalty.
[Gunni groans]

And now that we're done with his
bottom,

we gotta take from the top.

[hums melodically]

[fire crackles]

You've probably been wonderin'

this thing.

[strained breaths]

[lid creaks]

This is our daughter.

My god.


[eerie music]

Let's get this old girl fed.

Shall we?

See how you compare to Buggy
Boy.

Bless us, O Lord, and these, thy
gifts,

which we are about to
receive from thy bounty.

Through Christ, our Lord, amen.

won't try to run off.

Oh, look at Gunni there.

Sweet as a baby chipmunk, and

Well, a little pressure, maybe.

Then it's bright eyes and sweet

Hi, Sam.

Let's start with the

Get those out of the way.

Open up, darlin'.

Come on.

Just like Popeye.

Oh [scoffs].

Come on now, Sammy boy.

Open up, sweetie.

Come on, my love.

Just a bite to start.

Make room for the Lord.

Breathe him in.

Breathe him in.

Do you not know that your bodies

are temples of the holy spirit?

Who is in you.

Who you have received from God.

You are not your own.

You were bought at a price.

Therefore...

Honor God with your bodies.
