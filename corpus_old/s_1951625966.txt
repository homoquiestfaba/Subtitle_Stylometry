My friend just bought
one of those.

Let me drive it.
Fantastic car.

It's a fantastic day.

Okay, at 3: 00 this morning,
you were singing campfire songs.

And now look at you.
What is with you, Jeana?

Tom. I think we're
gonna get to know
each other better.

You're gonna sleep
with Tom Lindeman?!

Yes! Yes, okay?

Why?

I'm in love.

Why?!

I don't know,
because he's smart and
handsome and wonderful...

Ach! He's on television!
So what? Everybody is!

I n two weeks, I'm gonna be
on a cruise in South America.

[Camera clicks]

We're gonna make love,
and we're gonna watch sunsets.

And it's gonna be
like we're the only
two people in the world.

You know, if he was
the last guy on Earth,
maybe I could see it.

No, wait, I can't.

You used to like men.

Yeah, I used to eat dirt
when I was a kid, too.
I outgrew it.

Okay.
So you like
girls now. Great.

But this is about me, Oaroline.
L... I started dating when
I was 15 years old.

That's zero
in ten years.

Yeah, I've dated some losers,
and I've had my heart broken,
but I still believe in love.

And I found, I found Tom.

Oan't you just
be happy for me?

Wait, let me think.

M mm, no.

Tom Lindeman
tonight or any night.

Exactly.
Thank you.

Listen... I need a word.

No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

It's varied? Diverse?

How about "rich"?

Rich, thank you!
You're worthless!

"Rich" cultural background.

See that?
Savin' my ass
on the first day.

We're gonna
get along real good.

Susan wants you plugged in.

Nah, she just wants me.

Oops. Oops.
Should I say that
on TV? H i, Susan.

You're shooting me from
the waist up, right? 'Oause
we don't wanna see the blue jeans.

Tell Lindeman to stop
yakking and get ready.

He's there. You're fine.

'Oause anchormen
don't wear blue jeans.

Looking good? Blue skies?

Clear.

Olear. Another clear,
cloudless day in Tom's nostrils.

How much time you need?

I need five seconds,
is all I need.

Alright. Here we come.
Ready, remote...

How's that chlamydia,
Susan? Joking. Joking.
Oh! Oops.

Three, two...

And, and, and...
Take remote!

Hi. This is
Tom Lindeman.

If you can't get him
to listen to me, I'm just
gonna take to him next time.

And I don't care if
he's pickin' his nose and
the whole world sees it.

Ready VT-1.

Boys. What's this golf game
doing on here again?

M ust be a virus.

Yeah. This, uh, virus keeps
getting in there and setting up
Championship Golf Challenge.

Really? You boys
are the challenge.

Hey! Hey! How many times
do I have to tell you
this is not a cup holder?

Ha ha ha!
Ow!

You... you...
You...

I'm gonna get that
noon anchor job.
I can feel it.

That's great!


I can't believe
you bought a house!

Yup!

I feel old.

I n you go.
Thank you.


You saw that?

Yeah.

I tape you every night.

M mm...
Well then, uh...

From the future most
recognizable face in town
to his most devoted fan.

Opens my door
any time you want.

It's beautiful.

U h... Tom?

Yeah?

I think I need
a little more time.

Okay. Give me about
ten minutes to set up
the bed.


That's a joke.
A defense mechanism.

Oome from rejection.

I'm not rejecting you.

Good.

What... U m...
Okay!

Jeana?
Jeana, come on!

I was joking.

Half-joking!
I want it to be special.

Not like this.

Okay, okay.

I know you're not comfortable
getting physical with me.

Oan you tell me why?
Is it me?

I can't believe
what she said to me.
I mean...

it's unbelievable.

I mean, I believe it because
now it all makes sense,
but... wow!

Blue skies?

[Anchorman gives the news]

...proposal draws the ire
of animal-lovers all over.

Good evening, everyone.
Thanks for being with us.

And ready, remote,
ready or not.

She's 25 years old,
okay?

Tom! Tom?

She seems to know
all the moves.
She's right there.

But... Ha ha ha...
Yaahh!

Tom?

And now we go to Tom Lindeman,
standing by live. Tom?

And, take remote.

Get this:
My girlfriend... okay? Me!

My girlfriend?

Is a virgin.

I'll be having sex
with a complete virgin.

Aaaahhh!


I love live TV!
Oh, yeah, baby!

You're on! You're on!

Hi, this is Tom Lindeman,
coming to you live
from downtown.

[Phone rings]

Hello?

What?

No, but
Station 50 called.

They wouldn't tell me.

What did he say?

Tell me! Guys...!

Oh, wait. I think
I hear her coming in.

Did you see
the news?

Oh, yeah. U m...

Your granny's
on the phone.

H i, Grandma. What?

I'm your favorite
granddaughter now?

When'd this happen?
Hey, Grandma,
can I call you back?

Get this:
My girlfriend... okay? Me!

My girlfriend is a virgin.

Kill, Jeana. Kill!

[Crowd cheers]

[Door opens and closes]

I guess you saw it, huh?

Everybody saw it.
You told the whole city.

Oome on, I didn't
mention your name.

You didn't have to.
Everyone I know
has been calling me.

Would you talk to me?!

I made a mistake.

And I feel horrible, I do.
But you said so yourself...

your virginity's
not a major thing.

It's not.
It's a minor thing.

But it's
my minor thing.

I was just tellin'
my camera guy.

You gotta admit,
it's a little unusual.

What? I just
never did it with anyone,

It's not like I didn't try.

So you're saying
the effort was there,
you just lacked the aptitude?

It just hasn't
worked out. U h...

I'd be with a guy and
we'd be headed that way,
and... stuff would happen.

"Stuff"?

Stuff.

Like his ex-girlfriend
would come back from Ohina.

Or he'd have a court date,
and I'd never see him again.

Or... I'd get
the chicken pox.

You're supposed to
get chicken pox when
you're a kid,

but I would get them
when I tried to sleep
with someone.

Anyway, I was just hoping
you'd be a little more careful
with the information.

I know, I know.

What do you wanna do?
You wanna break up
over this?

No. Do you?

No.

So, come on, relax.
We'll order a pizza.

I'm not hungry.

What are you doing?

I wanna
make love with you.
What's wrong with that?

Nothing.

It can be the lead story
at 11: 00

How humiliating.

It's okay.
I'm fine.

You must wanna
kill yourself.

Or someone else.
Seen this?

"Our favorite reporter,
Tom Lindeman, told everyone...
and I mean everyone...

that his girlfriend's a..."

Oh, my God!

"Whoever she is,
let's hope she doesn't
hold a grudge."

Hold one.

You have to get even.

For women
everywhere.

You know what really gets me,
is that technically he never
really apologized.

You broke up
with him, right?

Of course she
broke up with him.
She's not stupid.

Excuse me.

Oan you tell me
where this is at
right here?

You're lost.
You're not even close.

Sweet.

Well, since I'm here,
can I get, uh, can I get, uh,
some French Sumatra please?

Whole beans.

Okay.

You don't break up with
someone when you've
been brought together

by something as powerful
as the triple-sneeze incident.

The what?

The triple-sneeze.
How I met Tom.

You crashed into his car.

But it was a meaningful crash.
I was driving along,
and I sneezed three times,

and then I hit him.

Yeah. You should hit him now.

I've never sneezed three times
before in my life. I've never been
in a car accident.

And I didn't hit the fat
weather guy from Channel 10,
I hit the dreamy reporter,

the guy I was fantasizing
about all that time

when I was trying
to get over Oharlie.

I mean, things like that
just aren't coincidence.

You bump into a guy like that,
and it means something.

Oh, sorry!
I'm so sorry!

I'll get it.
She pushed me.

It's okay, it's okay.

I'm... I'm really
not that clumsy.

Oh! Ooh!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Uh... French Sumatra?

Yeah, it was.

That's her favorite, too.

He's not... uh, it's not.

My favorite.

Good morning!

She seems so normal.

I mean, you know her
better than I.

Howcomes
you couldn't tell?

Well, gee, I guess I missed
the big "V" stamped
on her forehead.

Whatever you're thinking,
don't say it.

We'll take it nice and slow
since you haven't seen
the software before.

And you haven't seen
the hardware before.

Yeah, Lawrence, that was
a real exciting newscast.

Like watching your own
autopsy. Listen, can we
just talk about work?

Oh, forget it!

Animals!

Oh, my God! Six hundred
firefighters know my sex life!

Technically,
it's an anti-sex life.

I'm not going anywhere
with you.

What?!

You've made my life
a nightmare!

You think mine's
been a joyride?

I'm off the anchor list.
I don't even know
why you're upset.

Apparently virginity's "in."

I don't care about what's in!
I care about my private life,
and the fact that you told

a few hundred
thousand people!!

So you're not going?
No!!

Fine!

Norma, I need...


No, no.
Jeana.

Those aren't
your tickets!

Ha ha!

Ha!

I'm not going.

Are you sure,
honey?

Yes. When can I get
my money back?

U h, okay...
U h, let's see.

Oh, dear.
Oh, okay.

The cruise departs
13 days from now.

Deadline for refunds
was yesterday.

I paid $6, 000
for that ticket.

Actually, it was 6, 082.

But you could've gotten it
all back if you would have
had cancellation insurance.

I did! We did. You got
the insurance, right?

Well, actually,
it says here that he didn't.

Yeah, I thought I'd
save us a few bucks.
'Oause...

Gimme my ticket,
you oaf!

Oh, so now I'm an oaf?

Give it! I'm the one
who's been saving
for years!

I had this all planned
before we met!

I paid you $6, 000
for that ticket!
My half! Uch!

Actually, um,
it was $6, 082.42.

That you would have
been refunded.

If you would have had
the insurance.

If he wasn't an oaf.

So you guys
broke up, then?

No.

Why does everyone
assume that?

It's just tradition.

We'll work it out.
We just need to talk.
Everything'll be fine.

Good!

[Russian accent]
N ick, look at this.
Oan you believe this?

They're calling me
"a local bright spot."

That's great,
Zsa Zsa.

"A personality
to watch."

And you know
what else?

Me and Tom
are back together.

He's taking me on
a Brazilian cruise. It's...

He's what?

Oh, Jeana, hello.
You did... you didn't know?
She didn't know.

That is so like Tom.
I can't believe this.
I mean... Isn't he funny?

Oh, look. Tom's twin.

The cruise tickets.
Let's find them.

We should break something.
Oome on, it'd be good therapy.

No.


Does daddy
like mommy?

I think daddy
likes mommy a lot.

Where'd mommy go?
Where's mommy going?
Yes!

(Zsa Zsa)
Daddy, don't spank me!

Ay!


Aah!

Whoa. She's hot.

[Music blaring]

(DJ over radio)
Great stuff, huh?

So I've been getting calls
all night about that thing on TV,

Tom Lindeman
telling the whole world
his girlfriend's never had sex.

Turns out this buddy
of mine knows Lindeman,

happens to know that
this girl's name is Jeana.

Let's see what else
we can find out.
[Phone dialing]

(Tom over radio)
Lindeman.

My name's Tim.
I'm a friend of Jimmy Debbs.

Ha ha, sure.

I work in TVproduction
and Jimmy said maybe you could
get me in the door at Channel 8.

I can help you out
with that.

Great, thanks.
Oh, before I forget,

Jimmy said you're dating
this girl I went to college
with, uh, Jeana...

Yeah, Jeana Summers.
Ah, that's it.

Drive off
a really high cliff.

You went to college with her?
Have I got questions for you.

Why would that be?

Twenty-eight new messages.

Hey, Jeana. We met three years
ago at the trade show. What's up?


It's Domination Deluxe.
We provide a valuable service

to men in Northern California,
and we're looking for
a few good vir...

Alison Farmer, host of Channel
Eight's public affairs talk show...

...and I'm thinking,

m... maybe you haven't
met the right girl yet.
Come to mama.



(girl talking rapidly)
All my friends look up to you,
and we're all waiting, too,

So you're our hero. I mean,
you should go on Oprah.

And my mom says I should
copy everything you do... the
way you eat and sleep and talk.

So what are you gonna
do right now? I mean...

Channel 8 News.
May I help you?

He seems so nice
on television.

It's special effects.

Oh. I don't blame you
for not sleeping with him.

Gee, thank you.

Neither do the other
ladies in the office.

Listen, this trip was supposed
to be the highlight of my life.

It still could be, right?
I mean, I could meet
a guy on the cruise.

Oan't we just switch
the reservation?

Well, I'm sorry,
but the policy is strict

because the cruise line
can't resell your ticket
when you cancel this late.

So basically I need
a boyfriend who'll
betray me sooner.

That would work.

And this opportunistic person
can have my ticket?

Yes, I'm afraid so.

He wrote us a check
for the total amount.

But I'd suggest legal action
and have the perfect lawyer
for this.

It's my cousin Maggie.

She used to have
a little drug problem,
you know,

but she's, like,
all clean and sober now,
she's, like, a a lawyer,

and she's doing great.
She's perfect.
[Clicks her tongue]

Look, you cheating S. O. B,
you talk to my client again,

and I will rip your lungs out!

Sorry. That one kind of
tries my patience.

He's cheating on his wife.
Kind of like my husband
cheats on me!


You know what?
Maybe I should go.

No, no. I'm sorry. Okay,
lemme get a look at you.
H mm, you're pretty.

You sure you're a virgin?

Doesn't matter. Okay.
I need you to look hurt.
I need you to look vulnerable.

The jury will hate him.

Eh, God, I was
a virgin once. Didn't take.

You know, a lot of people
think lawyers don't have sex.

But I went to this
lawyer convention,
and let me tell you something:

This lady here...
several attorneys. At least
that's what they told me.

Enough about me.
How can I help you?

Oh, th... that's okay.

No, no, no. Listen to me.
You deserve me.

We are gonna burn this guy!
Okay, let's have a little fun.

Let's put him on the bonfire,
see how high the flame gets.
Who's with me?

She sounds perfect.

Yeah, but I can't sue until
he takes someone else,

so I'm getting those tickets
back. How do I do it?

Put out a contract on him?

Hmm. Too expensive.

I'll chip in.

Ever notice how your advice
about men always includes
death and destruction?

M mm. A girl can fantasize,
can't she?


Oh, I know. J ust fix it
so he doesn't wanna go.

Hey! Wait up!

He'd give up those tickets
for some big story!

He needs to save his career.
And so I've devised
the Phony Fire District Scandal.

We make believe
we're doing inspections

of the software companies so
that we can steal the software.

You guys convince him
the evidence is on
our computers.

So that when he comes
to me for the access,

I trade him the information
he wants for those tickets.
Both of them.

I've seen you
around the club.

Great.

# Up in the air #
#Oooh, oooh #

#Karate Boo-ga-loo, baby #

You know, don't you?

Word gets around.

On what,
the Virgin Alert Network?

How do you guys
find this stuff out?

Hey!
That's personal, okay?

Oh, personal?

[Bobby Oaldwell sings
The Girl I Dream About]

# The girl I dream about #

# The love I've waited for #

# I know her inside out #

Well, Glen,
for your company's needs,
I'd go with these guys.

This is fascinating,
and I think we should, uh,

discuss this in more
"depth" at my house.

Excuse me?

Let me explain
something to you, Jeana.

You haven't slept
with anyone yet 'cause
you haven't met the right guy.

I still haven't.

You gonna stab me
with that fork?

God, I'll bet you're
a real tiger when
somebody turns you on.

[Glenn screams]


Oheck, please.

No, bad girl! Oome on!

Hey! A little help,
please?

I don't wanna
get hit by a train.

Have a seat.
Grab the wheel.

That's good.

Just pull on that
emergency brake
in the middle there.

Got it!

Thank you.

So what's wrong with it?

It's outta gas.
The gauge is busted.

Why don't you
get it fixed?

Well, 'cause I like her
the way she is.

Well, I'll see ya.

Well, hang on. U h.

The only way I know
how to thank you is...

Know where I can get
a couple spoons?

I gotta go.

Oan't let this melt.

Look, no offense,
but you're a guy,

and it starts with ice cream
and deep conversations

and "Oooh, I'm so sensitive,"
but eventually, the true male
comes out,

and you'll start taking money
out of my wallet and hitting
on my best friend.

Or it comes out right now,
and I have to punch him
in the nose right here.

Well, with an attitude
large enough to crush
a small country having arrived,

I think it's safe
to call it a day.

Yeah, well, the gas station's
12 blocks that way.

Perfect.

"Professor Stewart Schell
says post-initial copulative
regret syndrome...

or losing it
and then wanting it back...
is becoming more common."

Well, listen to this:
"One result of this week's
public discussion

"has been the formation
of VAG U E, or Virgins
Against Guys U nder-Evolved.

"VAG U E was organized
by local women who
discovered a common bond

in their anger over
Lindeman's blunder."
You got company, girl.

[Shouting, talking]


H i. You don't
know me,

but, the thing is,
I live upstairs and
can I borrow your window?

Sure!

Oareful, darling.

Next time,
I'll bake cookies.

I joined that group...
Virgins Against Guys,
whatever...

What for?

Not because I'm pure
or anything. I just wanted
to support your cause.

It's not a cause.
I'm not making
a political statement.

Boy, are you edgy.

L... I just wanna find a guy

who wants to wake up
with me as much
as they wanna sleep with me.

Yo might try Finland.

Seriously.

Lmprovements?

You wanna
get this guy, right?

No! I want those tickets,
and I want out of here.

We're just goosing it up.

Wait a minute.
I'm the woman.
I'm the schemer.

The thing is,
you're not that good at it.

I'm not?

It wasn't a bad first effort,
it's just that we have more
experience

with this sort of thing.

So, just what
have you done?

You're better off
just knowing the first level.

Oh, there are levels now?

Relax. It's under control.

Don't forget the nude pictures
the guy from Utah sent you.

[Over the phone]
Alison Farmer again,
Channel 8.

You gotta come on my show
and tell everyone
where to get off.

Oh, My God. I am looking
out the window, and there's
a tornado coming.

And an earthquake.
Gotta go.

[Phone rings]

Hello.

H i, it's Tom.

How could you
give that photo
to the newspaper?

I didn't.

It's the one
on your desk.

Really?
H uh, you're right,
it's gone.

Thanks for noticing.
By the way, great
performance on the radio.

Okay. That was a trick,
and I'm gonna kill
J immy Debbs.

Oh. You wanna know
what my favorite part was?
Really?

It was Zsa Zsa
telling me that you guys
were back together.

How could you do that
after all we had?
After the way we met?

What are you talkin' about?
You crashed into my car.

What do you want?

I'm comin' over tonight
to get my stuff.

Thanks for the warning.

[Phone rings]

Lindeman.

Give me my ticket back!

You cancelled.

And if "no refund"
is good enough for
the cruise line, then...

Twice she hangs up on me.

You should give her
her money back, man.

You're missing the clues.
Olearly, she still wants
to go with me.

I hate him.

We don't want that shit no more!
One, two, three, four!

We don't want that shit no more!
One, two, three, four!

We don't want that shit no more!
One, two, three, four!

Face it, man.
You're just another
women's issue.

Right up there
with menopause
and maternity leave.


[Talking, shouting]

How's this story
affected your life?

What is your stance
on sex education?

I am never
talking to you people!


H i, Jeana.
Wendy Sagen,
President of VAG U E,

Virgins Against Guys
U nder-Evolved.
Isn't it great?

You on the cover,
our group picture inside.

We have to work together
to end male domination
of social and political...

Listen, I've had a rough day.

Jeana, let us hear your story.
We really need you to speak
at our rally.

You know what?
Wait here.

They're all monsters,
you know!

Most men are criminals!
I know! I have brothers!

It's like I'm some kind
of freak or something.

What's wrong with people?
Don't they get enough
on Jerry Springer?

Tom has made
his choice, hasn't he?

So why don't we both
just be big people.
Okay?

Gee, thanks for the advice.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

Bye, Nick.

Bye, Jeana.

Does this have dairy in it?

It's okay. I'm with
the fire department.

'Oourse she wants me back.
That's why we're here,

so she can deny it to my face.
Women love these games.

If you say so.

"A map to your stuff."
What the hell is this?

It's a map to your stuff,
man.

Oh, come on!

That was
my favorite racquet!

She is playing hard-to-get.

I bet I know where she is.

[M umbo Gumbo plays
Restless]

# And I'm restless #

# I got to find my way #

# Whatever the price,
You know I will pay #

Come on, Jeana.
Break those balls.

This is great.
A little sanity.

Fleeting, though,
it may be.

Come on,
let's get outta here.

Listen...

Watch it, lgor.
Genghis.

N ice bonfire.
I'd say we're even.

Yeah? We say you
owe her a cruise ticket.

Why don't you
let these two
work it out?

Who the hell are you?

I'm friends with Tom.
And Jeana.

Wrong. You can't
be on both sides.
It's us or them

And "us" is leaving.

I just have
to talk to you...

Let go of her,
you animal!
Hey, everybody!

Everybody, it's the reporter
who violated his girlfriend's
privacy on television!

U nbelievable!
I pity your girlfriend.

Yeah. How could
you do that, huh?

The guy made a mistake.

You broads expect us
to be perfect all the time.
I'm sick of it.

"Broads"? You don't know
what we're talking about,
mister!

Hey, don't point at me.
Don't call me a broad.

Toots?
Aargh!


# Ooooh ##

Will you unpack already!
My goodness.

Well, hello.

This is perfect.

The cruise ship...

the beaches...

the sun...

and me.


A fight broke out today
at a public rally at
the State Capitol.

Members of a group
supporting women
who are virgins

clashed with a construction
worker who allegedly
whistled at a woman.

Tensions have been high
between local men
and women since...

Isn't that
your grandmother?

It is.
The whole city's
off its rocker.

Wait. How can
your grandmother
be a virgin?

(Wendy on TV)
It goes beyond
the issue of sex

and one woman's privacy

We're sick of the construction
workers, the mechanics,
the car salesmen,

all the males
that are insensitive
to half the population.

The trouble with men
in this country is that
they're in this country.

Can't we ship them
all to France?
[Crowd cheering]

It's not that complicated
at all, man.

If a girl doesn't wanna
sleep with me, that's cool.

A train runs through
this station every 45 minutes.
[Crowd boos]

(TV anchor)
And in other news,

several nuclear warheads
are missing from
a launching site near Moscow.

Don't worry. I'm leavin'.

You're a photographer?

Yep. That way,
when they arrest me
for stealing your purse,

I can take my own
mug shots.

Listen, I'm really so...

Look, I got a gig out at,
um, El Dorado H ills.

Wherever that's at.
So...

Hey!
Hey!

There were six reporters
here looking for you,

so I just gave 'em
your home address.

J ust kidding. Actually,
I gave 'em a fake address.

So they'll probably
be back any minute
to kill me.

H mm. Ooffee?

Listen, I'm sorry
about the other day.
That wasn't really me.

U h-huh.

You're never clumsy
and you're always
in a good mood, huh?

It's a powerful drug,
denial.

I am in a good mood.
I've just had a lot
of creeps in my face lately.

And so you assume
that every guy is one, huh?
It's funny how women do that.

It's because men
are such men.

You know,
they're at least 60% of
the relationship problems.

Sixty percent, huh?
I didn't know that.

Maybe 70.

Think this thing'll
make it to El Dorado H ills?

I don't know.

I'm new here,
and I don't even know
where El Dorado H ills is.

Let's take my car.

It's just that every guy
that looks at me lately
wants... a date.

I wasn't asking
for a date the other day.

As a matter of fact,
I haven't been on a date
in three years.

You're kidding.

Nope.
It's not worth
the trouble.

I always run
to the next guy.

Yep. You end up
regretting it, too,
huh?

I can tell by the reaction
from the innocent little
frozen dessert the other day

that you've been
through the ringer,
what... three times?

Pretty close.

Actually, you nailed it.

I take it
you've been burned
by a woman or two.

Try six.
So don't put it all on men.

Six? You're
a slow learner.

Anyway she broke it off
four hours before the wedding.

No!
Yeah.

She always did like doing
things at the last minute,
God bless her.

Oh, my God.
So what'd you say to that?

Well, I would call
the bakery where
she worked,

and I would disguise my voice,
and I would order pastries.

[Foreign accent]
"Oan I get five pastries?
I need them now."


She gained 12 pounds
eatin' the leftovers 'fore
she figured out it was me.

Oh, no!
Oh, terrific!

Hold it.

Okay.

[Camera clicks]

Perfect. Perfect.
There you go.

Beautiful.

# I don't know why #

# You wanna follow me tonight #

# When the rest of the world #

# With whom I've crossed
And I quarreled #

Okay.

# Lets me down so #

# For thousand reasons
That I know #

# To share forever the unrest #

# With all the demons
I possess #

# Beneath the silver moon #

I never knew my feet
looked like this.

Yeah, well, it's amazing
what you can see
when you really look, huh?

Yeah. It is.

So, I saw you
dancing with that friend
of the bride up there.

Did you get
her number?

Didn't get her name.

She liked you.

I know.

Fascinating.

You really gave up
on us, didn't you?

That's right.

This last guy,
we had these moments

where it seemed like
everything was possible.

It seems to me
that men and women
only really get together

by some great
cosmic accident.

Yeah. A fluke, huh?

My parents are divorced.
My roommate.

I don't know anyone
who has what they want
romance-wise.

Well, this is great, huh?
Sharing each other's
painful experiences?

I'll tell you what.
I'm having a root canal
next week.

I'll give you a call
and tell you the details.

Oheers.

Animal crackers,
fireflies...

Kick the can.

Right! Right! Me, too!

So, um, when
do I get to see
my wedding photos?

Your what?

The photos I took.

Oh! The photos you,
uh, yeah, yeah.

I'll tell you what. Here
is my business card.
You just call.

May I?

Yeah.

Oh, wait.

My roommate's been
getting these weird calls,
so we changed our number.

U h, lemme...

I'll get the door.
Sorry.

Okay. Mary Beth.
Great red hair.
Great smile.

Broke your heart in
so many pieces you had
to pick it up with a dustpan!

Remember that?

Why can't I remember that?

# But baby I was lonely #

# I don't wanna fight #

So you bumped into him
just as you were saying
how meaningful that could be.

And he reads a lot,
and thinks, and smells good.

And he's got a sexy voice.
So what? He's the enemy, right?

Well, we've been
workin' together.

We need to
know each other.
So let's bond.

Enjoy, fellas.

Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

H i, guys. Welcome
to Firehouse.

My name is J ulie,
and I'll be your waitress.
You're Tom Lindeman.

Yes, I am.

Don't talk to me.
Your waiter
will be right with you.

Did you see that?
A week ago,
women loved me.

[Breathes into his hand]

Well, I guess people
can wise up in a week, huh?

I don't think it's in me
to be this bitter,
male-bashing person

like that lawyer.
Or you.

I like men.
Not the ones I've met.

You'll be much happier
once you accept

that all the romantic notions
you've had your entire life
are crap.

And the gender
you were counting on
to create your bliss

is really just hot
to get you in bed
and move on.

Your divorce is the most
depressing thing that's
ever happened to me.

At first, it was
like this... feud?

Yeah, a feud,
'cause I had to win.

I had to win. I had to get her
to go on the cruise with me
to save face.

But now, I don't know,
I mean, now it's just
kinda like...

You're in love with her.

Love? You think?

Yeah. I can hear,
I can hear it in your voice,
the way you talk about her.

You're right.

I'm in love with her.

'Oause she fries my stuff,
and I should be angry,

but I get, I don't know,
excited and everything,

and I guess I'm thinking
about her.

You gotta tell her. H m?

Maybe after she cools off.
I'll give her, say, ten years.

Then there was Kathy,
right? Oh, my...

See, this is what
I'm talking about, right?

This woman comes into my life,
and I've forgotten what all
the other ones did to me.

So this girl you met,
she a babe or what?

You don't divide 'em into
babes a... a... and non-babes.

Yeah? What, then?

I don't know. I mean...
There's "her", and then
there's everybody else.

"Her"?

Yeah...

Yeah, but she said she's done
with men. I think that she's
hung up on this guy.

Well, take your shot.
He's probably
some loser.

[Hoof beats approaching]

Why the long face?

[Over answering machine]
Hey there. It's, uh, Paul,
and, uh, this is my voice.

Listen, this gallery in,
in Midtown is showing
my photos,

and the opening's Friday night,
and maybe if you're
not doing anything,

you know, or, or, you know,
maybe if you wanna bring
your roommate,

and I swear,
I'm not hittin' on her...

It's just, just that I don't know
anyone here and it'd be,
uh, it'd be nice

to have some
people come, so...

Now, let me stress,
this is a, uh, this is
a non-date type of activity.

No dates for anyone.

Farnham Gallery at, uh,
8:00 P.M., so there you go.

Um, talk to you later,
if you want. Bye.

What am I doing?

Well, it would be wrong
not to support the arts.

The woman is diabolical.

[Tins bang]

This is why you don't trust
women, 'cause they're crazy.

'Oause they hide things
and they're secret.

What?

Nothing.

Don't worry. Those tickets
are in a very safe place.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

I got a tip on this story.

Firefighter says there's
something fishy going on
in the Fire District.

Gonna ride along
with them later today.

That's very interesting.
Let's go.

Okay.

My boss won't talk to me.
Women despise me.

I don't know
what's going on any more.

I need this story.
I need my pride back.

This'll do it.
Our guys do an inspection
of the software company.

They're in the computer room,
they get the building manager
flustered,

he doesn't realize
four guys go in
and only three come out.

So one guy stays back
and then what?

He dials out on the modem.
It's so simple.

These places have
all the security to keep
people from getting in,

but there's nothing to prevent
someone from getting out.

So he dials out to...?

The mastermind.

No one sees this guy.
He just pays our guys
to do the job.

Once the connection's made,
he dials out on the modem,

hacking into
the computer system.

Okay.
I gotta see this.

No. They see you,
I'm... I'm dead.

They won't.

And three come out.
Very smooth.

Whoa!

Jeana, look at this.

I just had sex
on my lunch hour.

This waiter at Dominick's,
out by the dumpster.

It was so hot.

So I'm not one of you guys
any more. I'm outta the club,
okay?

Yeah. Funny you should
say that. Oheck out
the celebrities page.

"Yeah, I had sex
with Jeana Summers.
We were both pretty wasted"?!

Who the hell's this?

The drummer from
Deadly Barter. Jeana,
this doesn't look good for us.

Get me Alison Farmer.
I'll do her show.

So, basically
you're a romantic?

Was. Now, I'm in recovery.

H m! But you're not
mad at men?

No. I'm mad at God
for making me attracted to men.


It's just that everyone
looks at you differently when
they discover you're a virgin.

And they have all these weird
opinions about what that means.

When I was in high school,
my virginity was admirable.

When I was in college,
it was "cute".

Now that I'm older,
people just find it
incredibly strange.

That's her? That's
your virgin girlfriend?

Shhh! Be quiet!

What do you want?

I'm just surprised.

At what?

You made her out
to be this, like, this, this...

...instead it's this big fight
between men and women.

You don't, you don't think
her ears are a little big?

Are you kidding? She's fantastic.
You can't even see her ears.

I'm just sick
of the whole virgin-fest.

That's not the real issue.

What is?
Love.

Respect. Oaring.

And these are words that
nobody's mentioned since
this whole thing started.

All my friends say
their first time was awful.

It shouldn't be awful.
It... it should be astonishing
or superlative.

It should be something
that's worth waiting for.

It's hard enough being
single and scared and alone.

And then you have people
smacking you in the face
every day

with what a fool you are
for believing in love.

Maybe if you wait
a little longer,
take a little more time...

She is so wise,
so together.

M m-hmm.

...the right person
comes into your life,
and it's a whole new thing.

It's too bad you
just don't know who
that person's gonna be.

Me.

Your boyfriend revealed
your biggest secret on TV.

Now here you are.

Come on.

Tell us a secret
of Tom's.

I don't think he has any.

There's not much
going on inside there.

What?! There's a lot
going on inside here.

"So wise, so together"...

Okay, she doesn't know
how I feel. I gotta talk to her.

No, no, no, no, no.
You don't wanna
go in there now.

Look at her...
she's all worked up,
and she's emotional.

J ust, uh,
let her cool down.

Okay. You're right.
You're always right.

She's gonna be at
the health club 'till 7: 00,
so I'll talk to her after.

She is photogenic,
though. Wow!

She'll be at the health club
until 7: 00. I have to tell her.

"I know you're Lindeman's
girlfriend. " She'll hate that!

H i. I'm Oarl.
Welcome to the club.

H i, how are you?
I'm just here to talk
to someone.

Well, you can talk to me.
U h, tell me, what exactly
are your fitness goals?

I'm just looking for...

We've got a Premium
Membership you might
want to take a look at.

Oan I just...

No, no, no.
We don't let non-members
wander around the club.

She's probably just
right around the corner.

Ah, that's great.
You know, we got
full cardio...

Free weights.
Pool, aerobics...

U h-huh, right.
What's it gonna take?

Hah!
I'm glad you asked.

This is the cardio area.

Hey!

I know you.

Well, what...
I didn't know you...

Paul here
just joined the club.

Thank you, Oarl.
Oan you give us
a minute?

You know, I haven't
finished my tour yet.

Okay. Hey! You know what?
You're gonna love this.

It's so far out there.
I, um... I know...

I know...

[full band playing
romantic music]

[Music dies down]

I know, uh, I was
pretending to be cool,

but I would love it
if you'd come to my opening.

I'm coming.
You are?

Yeah. It's, uh,
this Friday, right?

Yeah. Terrific, great.
Alright, it's a date.

Excuse me?

Oh, no. No, no, no,
not "It's a date",
like it's a figure of speech.

Not like, not like
what you thought.

Not like a date.

Why don't we?

I think we should.

You know, you
shouldn't stop like that.

You need to warm down
before you...

You don't date.

It's against
your religion.

Our whole friendship
is based on the fact
that you don't date

and I won't. You said
yourself it's a mistake
to run to the next guy.

Okay. But not if it's me.

U m...

I'm... I'm not coming.

Wha... wha... whoa.
Why not?

I think I should be
by myself. Really.

Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

Is that all it is?

What else?

I don't know. Something like you
still have feelings for that guy
you were seeing.

Get serious.

What if he called you
tonight?

I wouldn't care.

That's not
what your face says.

Oan l...
Jeana...

Hey! I haven't finished
the tour yet.

Oarl, will you shut up!
Jeana, please?

If you've gotten him
out of your system,
then why this big feud?

Who called it a feud?

Well, n... no
specific person.

Oome here.

Listen to me.

My life has been
a catastrophe lately.

I don't want to get
into details, and you
don't want to know.

Believe me. The truth is,
I am thrilled you don't know.

You are?

This friendship is
the only thing in my life
that's working.

Oan't we just leave it be?

Yeah. Yeah, sure.

Thanks.

So... maybe
I'll show up on Friday,

but that's the best
I can do.

She said "friendship",
man. You're history.

Now, how 'bout
those abs?

We should be the town
of the toast, and you're
busy thinking or something.

I got a lot on
my mind, Zsa, Zsa.

Like what?

A certain computer geek?
I don't need this.

You know, I have a shoot
with Fabio in the morning.

[Cell phone rings]

Lindeman.

Hey, it's Randy
at the Fire District.

You saw how the scam works.
Now you need the list
of companies they're hitting.

Who has the list?

It's in the inspection files
in the computer system.

But only the computer people
have access to all the files.

Really?
Very interesting.

Alright.

This is the most
sexual-looking food
I've ever seen.

I wish you'd come with me.

Wow!

It's an opening.
People dress up.


I would kill myself
for you.

I would kill mys...
I would kill myself for you.

I can't.

H i.
Hello, love. Oome on in.

Have a nice time.

Wow!
You look terrific.

Really.

I'm running late.

For what?

It's private.
Not for broadcast.

I'm working on a story about
bogus fire department
inspections

and, uh... I really
need some information.

Me, help you?

You have every right
to hate me.

What are we
doing here?

You love this place.

That's what I mean.

[Organ playing
stadium music]

[Crowd cheers]

Whoo!

I'm not having fun.

Then you're crazy.
Look at this, it's perfect.

Okay.
[Clears throat]

It is dirty pool
bringing you here.
We had great times here.

But where can we go?
We had great times
all over this city.

I thought we were gonna
talk about business.

Jeana, I've broken up
with plenty of women

and this is the first time
I've ever done it

and thought about
that woman constantly.

Okay. You know
how you divide things up?

There's "her", and then
there's everything else.

"Her"?

You.

Ugh. I screwed that up.

You know, I wrote some things
down here, some notes,
and, uh...

Okay. Okay.

I don't know.

I'm not very good
without a script,
but l... I wanna be.

Good.

For you.

I'm supposed
to be someplace.

Lemme explain.

Listen, we discuss
the district or I'm leaving.

Okay. Alright. You win.

I need those
inspection files.

Well, then,
what's in it for me?

Wait a minute.
Both tickets?

One of them belongs to me,
and I'll trade you the files
for the other one.

That hardly seems fair.

H uh. "Fair"?
When'd you learn that word?

Okay. Alright. I know
we're having this fight,

but if we could just step
around it for a moment...

Oh! You can't step around it!
It's the same thing! You want
something for nothing!

You're the reason why
relationships don't work!

Okay. Blame me for
the world's problems.
Are you giving me the files?

Are you giving me
the tickets?

I'll stop by and
pick them up tomorrow.

[They exchange goodbyes]

I wanted to see
your pictures.

I got some at my place.

Okay.

That's a nice dress.

Thanks.

Yes, ma'am. It went
really well, actually.

No. Well, I can't really
talk about that right now.

Because she's right here.

Yeah. I'll talk
to you later, Mom.

H mph. Wrong number.

I kinda told her about you.

Would you like some tea?

Yeah.
Okay.


A little hot.

These are wonderful.

Thanks.
Thank you very much.

I took that one at, uh,
my granddaddy's ranch
in Texarkana.

Here's a nude one
of my mom.

I'm joking.

[Fake accent]
I call thees one
"The Agony of De Feet."


They're so in love.

[Joan Jett and The Blackhearts
play Crimson and Clover]

# Ah #

# Now I don't hardly know her #

# But I think I could love her #

# Crimson and clover #

# Ah #

# When she comes walking over #

Thanks.
I'll be going now.

What?

I have to go. I'm sorry.

We've got something here.
You don't feel that?

I don't want to!
But you do.

If I stay, we'll ruin
everything. I know it.

I'm not asking
for anything tonight.

Hey, I'm not asking for anything
this year. J ust don't go.

# Yeah #
#Ba-da-da-da-da-da #

# My, my such a sweet thing #

# Ba-da-da-da-da-da #

# I wanna do everything #

# Ba-da-da-da-da-da #

# What a beautiful feeling #

What this movie needs,
Oary Grant.

Walter Matthau.

Walter Matthau, hm?

M mm-hm.
I see how you are.

We didn't say no kissing,
did we?

Not yet.
Maybe we should.
I n ten seconds.

Okay.

I should go home
and change.

No, no, no.
You look great.

Move over just a bit.
Right there. Alright...

Scoot over here.


M mm. Together forever.

Oh, really?

Well, on film.

Let me get one more,
real quick.

Hey, Jeana!

You guys
know each other?

You guys know
each other?

Yeah.
We work together.

But you're
a still photographer.

On the weekends.

My camera guy!

Oh, my God!

Then you know,
you know everything.

That is, uh,
fairly accurate.

I thought you were
the only guy in the world
who didn't know.

You're the guy
he's been blabbing to
in the first place.

Right. Jeana...

And you didn't tell me!

You didn't want me
to tell you!

What's this? The same
dress as last night?

What? What does
that mean?

It means,
you know, that...

She went home with
someone she barely knows.

What exactly
are you trying to imply?

How do you know what
dress she had on
last night?

Because what
you're implying is none
of your business to imply.

You were with him
last night?

How long has this
been going on?

You wore this dress
to see him.

I didn't "see" him.

You said she had
big ears.

(Jeana) What?
(Marty) That's just weird.

What were you doin'
together last night?

What's the difference?
There's a big difference.

Gimme that.
No.

I didn't plan on seeing him,
and you weren't honest.

God, you're just
as much a guy
as the rest of them!

L... I can't believe
I did it again.

I don't even
like popcorn.

My camera guy!

Hey, guys, guys!

Gimme the ball!

You told me that I was
in love with her.

That was before I knew
that your "her" was my "her".

As a matter of fact,
I can't even believe that
I have the same "her" as you.

Hey, wait a minute!
You two are ridiculous!

At least you have
somebody to fight over!

I have no one!
I just have my... my...
my work, my midget porn,

and...

Yeah, that was
kind of personal.

[Bob Woodruff
featuring Lucinda Williams
sing There's Something There]

He didn't go for it.

There's a backup plan.

Backup plan,
as in what?

As in Ken and Barbie
don't make it to
the airport tomorrow.

J ust say "Plan B"
and it's on.

I couldn't do that.

You okay?
I mean, for real.

For real?
I'll let you know.

# So hold on to me #

# We're both a little scared #

# We can't deny
There's something there #

You wouldn't give me
a chance the other night,

and then you go sleep
with some guy
you just met?

Wait. Who said that l...?

You trying
to get back at me?

I'll give you the files
for the tickets,

and then we never have
to speak to each other again.

Ha ha! I don't think so.
"A", you're the last person
I'd give 'em to now.

And two, I don't care
about that story any more.

You need that story!

This whole thing
has pumped up our ratings
like you wouldn't believe.

My boss loves me.

I start anchoring the
noon show as soon as
I get back from the cruise.

Fine!
Fine!

Fine. You and the mannequin
have fun on my vacation!

Fine!

At least she has sex.

I'm not going.

Of course, neither are they.

[Picks up phone, dials]

Randy? Launch Plan B.

H i!

Oh, hi.

H mph.
N ice bunch of girls.

I'm desperate,
desperate I tell you.

And I'm starting over.
So I won't be going
to Vegas with you, Jack.

I won't be seeing you
in Vegas, Jack.

Sweetheart?

Yes?

I'm here to
break up with you.

No.

Not 'till after our cruise.

I need those tickets.

Kiss me, Grandpa.

They're in this room,
aren't they?

What?

This must be worth
a couple thousand.


It's 3, 500, plus tax.
So whatever you
are thinking, don't.

If you don't
give me the tickets,
I rip this in half.

Booooo!


Losers!

H i, my name's Oaroline.
I'll be your roadblock
for the evening.

Yeah, you look
like a roadblock.

You're unbelievable!

Watch it, shorty!

You're invited outside.

Alright, let's go.
Ladies first.

Anybody see any
ladies around here?

I'm so tired of this.

Good.
Then let's go to Rio.

For the first time in my life,
I'm in love with someone.
You.

Do we have to do
this right now?

I've been thinkin' so hard
that I've been getting
nosebleeds.

I've been thinkin'
about you and me

in the same place
at the same time,
all the time.

J ust...

J ust give me
another shot, Jeana.

Will you marry me?

Sit here.

"Will you give me
another shot, marry me?"

Did that sound stupid?

It's not so smooth
you should lead off with it.

Ach, sorry. I just didn't
have time to rehearse,

and all I know is that
all this crazy stuff
happened between us,

but somehow I love you,
and I really think that that's
how it's supposed to feel.

Do you remember
the first time that
you told me about this trip?

How excited you were?
Let's just start right there.

Right there.

I'm not your girlfriend
any more.

Then come as a stranger.
We'll share a cabin.

We don't even have to
talk to each other or look
at each other.

Let's just stop being
enemies. It feels wrong.

No boyfriend-girlfriend,
no sex. J ust acquaintances.

Okay. Yes.

I just wanna get
far away from here,
that's all.

If you even so much
as look at me the wrong
way and it's Tom overboard.

Okay. I'll pick you up
tomorrow morning at 8: 00.

Stay.

Hey, tough girl.

What do you call
two lesbians...

[groans in pain]


[Crowd cheers]

[Door closes]
[Keys jingle]

Oh! No. I've gotta
call Randy.

What a rumble, huh?
I barely got out before
the cops got there.

We got 'em good
for you, though.

For me? I didn't
want a war.
This is you.

You and those
virgin whackos
stirring things up.

Oh. You didn't start this?
I didn't almost get punched
in the face tonight for you?

Oaroline you always get
punched in the face by
every guy that you talk to.

I just wanna get along.

Is that what your
big plan was all about?

You were the one
who pushed me into that.

Pushed you?
I merely gave you
a great idea!

Who said "Jeana,
don't let him get away
with this,

Jeana, you have
to get even"?

I don't know why I listen
to your advice about men
anyway.

Your marriage
was a disaster.

You're right. It was.

That's why I try
to help my friends
avoid the same mistakes.

Aw, Oaroline,
I'm sorry.

[Door closes]

Oh...

Oh, no!

No! No!

(male voice)
Hello, you've reached
Fire Station 50.

We're out on a call right now.
If you'd like to leave
a message...

Aaargh! No!

Engine 50, you know
what to do.

And let's get this right,
gentlemen. Jeana's
counting on us.

You got it.
No problemo.

Jeana, come on!
We're late!

I'll be right down!

Or if you want,
we can go with the...

more classic shot,
something like that.

I have to, uh...

I have to go. U m,
keep these and look...

I'm so sorry. L... look
at these, and I will,
uh... I'll call you.

I know he's on a call.
That's why I'm calling
dispatch.

Get him a message.
Tell him that Jeana
says call it off.

What? No! L...
Great!

Uch!

Ow!

Ouch!

Oh!

Hey, sweetie.
What do you say
we take the long way?

Hey, guys?
Randy put you
up to this, right?

U h, no.
Never heard of him.

But if you can
get back to your vehicle,

we can finish this training
exercise and get you
out of here.

Ah, training exercise.
How clever.

Yeah. If only I'd made
the Fire Department.

I look good
in uniform, baby.

Think she's
too tall for me?

Yeah.

She did what?

She went to the airport with
whats-his-face five minutes ago.

What airline?

I don't know.
What am I,
her travel agent?

Uch, I can't let her
go with him.

Okay, um...
Okay, look. Just get
to the airport and start there.

Alright. Thanks.

Where is the airport?

So we're not going
to the airport?

That cat's been
up there a long time.

So we're not going
to the airport?

Well, we're not going
to that airport.

I got us seats
on a charter jet.

We're going
to another airport.

So they'll wait for us?

Well, no,
there's passengers,
you know, on the flight

besides us,
so, no, they
wouldn't wait.

Relax. It's quality
time, honey.

So I come
to the l-80 split...

Yeah...

...and I stay to the left.

Sure.

Oh, God!

Ha ha ha!
Fake cat!

Fake cat.

Alright.

[Engine starts dying]

Aaah!

Not now, not now.
Dammit!

What're you
doin' to me, man?
What're you doin' to me?

Fix the gas gauge!

We need to do something
or we're not going.

Well, at least we're
not going together.

I'm serious.

Alright. I'm serious,
too. U h...

We'll get there.
This is temporary.

We have to do something.
We... you have to do something!

We need to go through
a lawn or a back yard
or something,

because we need
out of here!

I do like it rough,
but I'm not gettin
arrested for you!

Talk to him.

U h, hi, I'm Tom.

You originally
from Sacramento?

Oarmichael.
Oarmichael's pretty.

Hey, look at it like this:

There's a three-sided
poly gon

and associated with
each vertices is a name:

Jefferson, Hamilton,
and Franklin.

What's a vertice?

It's a point of a
geometrical construction.

Oh!

Thank you very much.

Look at this.
First the Datsun, then
the Gremlin, and now you.

Well, guess what?
You're fired.
I'm getting a new car.

Hey! Hello! H i!

We're here for, uh,
The charter jet.

Too bad it's not
here for you.

Man!

It's like everybody
wanted us to miss
that plane.

You have no idea.

That story you're
working on, it's fake.

What?

I made it up for the tickets.

Wow!

You musta really wanted
to stop me from goin'
without you.

I didn't want you to go.

You... you didn't
wanna go with me?

You're surprised?
I've never been more furious.

You told the whole world
my biggest secret,
and you didn't apologize.

Wait. That's what
this was all about? You
wanted me to apologize?

Yeah.

Wh... why didn't
you just say so?

I wanted it to be your idea.

Oh...

'Oause, you know,
it's funny.

If you had slept with me
just once, none of this
would have happened.

You're never gonna
marry me, are you?

I should've been crushed
when that plane took off,

but I wasn't.
I was relieved.

Let's face it, it's over.

Hi.

You ever watch
Ohannel 8?

Virgin.

What are you
doing here?

Oh, don't ask.
Long story.

Listen, I'm sorry, Oaroline.
I was such an idiot.

Well, me too.
We... we shouldn't talk
about men, I guess.

Somehow, I don't see
that happening.

Well, don't listen
to me so much.

You know, uh,
recent events
got me thinking.

So...
I called old Adolph.

You called your
ex-husband after
two years?

M m-hmm.

I apologized for driving
his truck into the lake.

What did he say?!

He said he's really lonely.

Oh, he misses you...

No, he misses the truck.

[Intercom rings]

Yeah?

Caroline, it's Paul.
Can I come in?

U h, no, l... I just
got out of the shower.

Well, do you have
an overseas
number for Jeana?

Some way
I can get ahold of her?

'Cause I really
need to talk to her.

U h, no, I don't have
a number for her.
But, um...

What would you
want me to tell her
in case she calls?

Tell her...

Tell her that I want
our night together
to last forever. Okay?

Tell her that I am done
blaming women, okay?
This was my fault.

I tried to tell her,
but she didn't want me
to know, you know,

and I didn't want
to disappoint her.

You know? I never
want to disappoint her.

You can understand that,
can't you, Caroline?

Yeah, I can.

I've been alone pretty much
all the time in the past
three years,

and l... I've done
a lot of thinking, and
l... I got to know myself,

and what I want, and it turns out
who I want. L... I, that's why
I chased her to the airport.

I've never chased
anyone before.

I walked into that
coffee shop by mistake.
Alright?

I was lost. And it turned out
to be one of those
cosmic accidents

she's always talkin' about,
you know? Like a sublime
event, you know?

Something arranged
by the gods so that two
people are happy. And l...

I've been waiting,
just like her,

okay, for my something
superlative and astonishing.

And then she ran
into me.

J ust tell her...

Tell her I love her.

Like never before
and never again.

Going out
for several hours.
Door's unlocked.

Well, that
was subtle.

Million Things]

# Than a million things #

# About you #

# That I adore #

Oh!

Sorry.
I'm sorry.

It's okay.

# And if words
Could describe you #

# They would have #

# To pick a number #

# And wait in line #

# I'm waiting #

# Waiting for you #

# To say you do #

# And I hope
You understand "no," too #

# But please come #

You okay?

Actually, um...

I'm seeing spots.

There's one right here
and right here.

U h, have you

What?

Never mind.
