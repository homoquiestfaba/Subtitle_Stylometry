Hey, got your message.

Is everything okay?

I'm coming over.

Jesse what...
Don't come any fucking closer

Okay

Okay, I...I just wanna talk

You don't understand okay. Uhm...I'm...

I am confused

I've been having these feelings but...

but I know know that it's a sin
and that it's wrong

but, look, you gotta promise
not to tell anyone, okay?

Where are you parents?
What?

Where are your parents?

What the fuck does that matter?

They probably told the whole 
goddamn church about me

He did hit you again?

It was my fault
 No Jesse, it' s not your fault

I deserved it
My dad, he can help

Don't you get it

He's already signed me up
for his correctional therapy

What?...What therapy?

You should know golden boy

I'm gonna pop to the fucking pious

He's gonna fix me with his Jesus powers

Look Jesse, you're drunk,

you're not thinking straight

It's going to be okay,
I can tell

But you can't

I'm a freak

Don't!

Listen, just listen
No, it's gonna be okay.

I'm calling someone for help
No...I love you

Don't hit me

No Jesse,

I love you for you
