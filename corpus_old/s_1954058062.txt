Wait, come back.

Please!

Please, help me

OPEN GRAVE

Help me!

He has no food, he has no water.
He's not one of us.

We have to take care of us right now.
But...

Drop your weapon.
Drop your gun.

Both of you, please don't.
He's here to kill us.

Gonna blow your fuckin' head off! Drop your gun.

I won't put it down. You put yours down.

Do it!

Put your gun down.

Tell him to put his gun down.
Lukas!

Tell him to put his gun down!
Lukas, please!

This your house? Huh?

Whose house is this? You kill those people in the pit?
Fuck you!

You killed those people, who are you?

I...I don't remember.
That's bullshit.

Who are you?

I-I woke up in the pit...and I
don't remember anything before it.

She helped me. Okay. This woman
helped me. I need to talk to her.

You let him out? You stupid?

Yeah, easy!

Do you know me? Why'd you let me out? And you...

Get your hands off of me!

What's wrong with him?

Help me!

Just breathe!

What's wrong with him?
He needs to breathe.

Hey, then!

Here, here, here, here.

Look at me, you will be okay.

Here's water, drink it.

Okay, okay, okay.

What the hell's goin' on?

Do you people know each other?

You just need to breathe.

Breathe.

Hey!

Who are you, man?

I don't remember who I am.

None of us do.

Okay, we have no phone and no computer.
There's no way to contact the authorities.

All we have to go on is-is these.

So we know our names.

I'm Sharon.
Hi.

Mi-Michael.

Youve met Lukas, so this must be Nathan.

Nathan.

Nathan.

I'm Nathan.

I don't know my name, I didn't have ID.

We also have keys.

I have a Nissan.
I have a key.

Do we have cars ?
No.

There's no cars. I looked around outside, there's nothing.

Can you understand what she's writing?

She's writing over and over things. Can you read this?

What language is this?

She-She can't...

understan...She can't understand you.
Hey, she helped me, okay?

Do you know me? Why did you help me?
Right? I tried it.

Stop trying, you're freaking her out. It's just...

You know me. Okay, you helped me out
of the pit. Don't look at these fuckers.

It doesn't matter what you say, because she couldn't...
Hey, shut up!

She doesn't understand you, okay?

Well, is she deaf?

No, she's not deaf.

Alright, she can hear you, she
just doesn't understand English.

She's mute.

But she acts like she knows us.

We all woke up in this house a half hour
before we found you and she was already here.

Anything else?

I'm Catholic, apparently.

And that's it?

Well, you also had a gun.

Yeah, you had a gun, too.

I didn't dig it up out of a pile of dead people.

We're all in the same boat here.
No, we're not in the same boat.

We were in the same boat. He was
in the boat with all the corpses.

I don't trust you.

I don't trust you.

I don't trust any of you.

Have you checked the house?

Yes.

We both have this.

Why? What happened? What happened to us?

I know. What happened?

Where's the girl.

I need to talk to the girl.

Guys, I need to speak to the girl.

I need ya to look at something for me. Look at this.

Did you do this? Did you write this?

Yes, you wrote it. Okay. What does it mean?

Guys!

What is this?

Now we have some ammunition.

Well, I suppose to kill so many
people, you need a lot of bullets.

What?

Maybe you're a cop.

I say we, eh, take some of these
and go and have a look around outside.

No.

We load up and protect ourselves in here.

We'll go in the morning.

Showers work.

We haven't found any medical supplies.

You can use proxide on that.

Or you're looking at serious infection.

Do you need a help?
I'm okay.

Okay.

There's some clothes in the bedroom. I'll get you some.

You won't need that anymore.

I prefer to hang onto it, if you don't mind.

Suit yourself.

I'm okay, thanks. I'm okay.

I'm okay.

I am not okay.

Who are you?

My name is...

Remember.

Guys, the girl run off.

There she is.

Should we follow her?

Shit!

Okay, gun guy, lower those weapons.

Yes?
In order to

Yes
Just...Yes, yes.

Alright, stay with him and make
sure we don't miss the house.

Okay.

Where the fuck is she?

I don't know.

Maybe she's leading us out of here.

Might be a city or something.
We're nowhere near a city.

How do you know ?
That.

What do you mean?
Stars are too bright.

We're miles from anywhere.

After you.

Go.
No, please, I insist.

Fuck off, go!

Would you two hurry up. We're losing her.

What 's that smell?

Oh, my God!

Who does this?

Someone likes to decorate.

Another one?

Look at this.
What is it?

I can read Latin.

Let me try

No...Nothing

I mean, physically, I can do stuff.
So.

And my hands remember. My body remembers.

My mind's a complete blank.

You know this place?

You know, this house.

No.

I know these books.
Oh.

Medical, biological reference books.

I mean...

From different countries, different periods in history.

They all relate to human or animal anatomy.

Wait a second.

What is it?

Oh, my God.
What?

What?

I can speak French.

I think this is your house.

She's feeding her like a baby.

Fuck me.

You used me.

Jesus, she knows you.

Sharon, you sure. I don't trust him.

I recall him!

Someone is watching us.

What?

I'm not just leaving her in there.
We have to.

She was tied up for a reason.

It is inhumane.

She attacked you. Did you
forget this. She's a crazy woman.

You're unbelievable.

Listen.
What?

There is a camera in the shack,
we need to find the monitoring center.

Only building we've seen so far is the house.

It's Italian.

It means "A man with a lot of
keys has a lot of things to hide".

Turns out, I know a few languages.

Congratulations.
Hmm.

"When they're all effect cometh the smile."

That's crazy.

We both know Latin?

You know, I have the strongest feeling I know you.

Really?
Yeah.

Yeah.

And I feel like I know Sharon, too. I mean, not as

familiar as I feel with you, but it's there.

But then I keep thinking maybe she's my girlfriend.

Or my sister. She could be my
sister and that'll be pretty gross.

You think she likes me?

I-I don't have time for this, okay?

I-I gotta get this door open.

Try to find some tools, like a crowbar, or something.

Get it in there and try and pry it open.

You're not gonna pry that open with a crowbar.

How do ya know? You haven't even tried.

No, that's a reinforced iron door, you're
not gonna get it open with a crowbar.

What about your keys?

Where'd you get those keys, Gendarme?

I found 'em.

Where'd you find them?

Downstairs. In a living room
with all the books you can read.

So, what's in here, Nathan?

I see.

I'm not trying to make an enemy here, okay? It's just...

We can't bash the door in now.

Everybody's tryin' to sleep.

It's been a long night.

I think you should get a couple of hours rest.

Locked doors will still be here when you wake up.

We need to find the cars
I think he's got a point.

You know, you think he's got a point, mate. I wasn't here

when you had the meeting to make him boss. Okay?

This time, no, I'm going with you.

You-You need me.

Why?

Why? Because I'm the best shot.

How do we know?

Jesus Christ, Michael.

What the hell ?
How 'bout that? You know now?

Stay here and guard the house.

Why won't they listen to me?

Because of what you just did.

Is he dead?

I hope so.

This fence must run the whole way around the house.

What's that smell. I can't handle it.

Lukas?

Somebody's put 'em all around the house.

Maybe it's a warning.

The white knight.

I want 'em to listen to me.

No doubt...I could have helped them.

It is my job.

It comes...

It IS my job.

How would I have this?

And who are you to me?

My wife? Girlfriend?

If I knew what was going on, because it's...

I'm not like the others, they're all smart.

But I'm...I'm here to do something.

How do we know one other?

My quiet girl.

This thing between us...

It's important. I know it.

Get in the house, get inside now. Now!

Just-Just move. Go!

Go inside.

Okay. Now you go in here, lock the door. Close it!

Now!

What'd you think, which way?

Really? You're throwing rocks?

They're our cars.

Please, help!

Please!

Pleeease!

Please

Please!

Ohhh!

Okay, shhh.

Please, help!

I'm sorry.

OHHH!!

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

It'd be easier if you were silent.

Please!

Help meee!

Come on.

Got a quarter tank.
Battery's dead here.

There's fuel inside.
Yeah, it's okay, Nate. We can push start it.

Nate?

What's the matter?

Headache. Nothing.

Okay, this is little low on
gas, but I think we should just

try and drive out of here and see what we can find.

There's no way.

What?

You're not with us.

I could be the one taking the photo.

Guys, we need to get help.
We don't need anything.

We'll end up with fuel in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

Let's get back to the house, figure out what's goin' on.

He's got a point.

Sharon?

Guys!

Michael.
Michael!

Kill me.

Help me move him!

Guys, support his head.

Oh, Lukas, stop the blood.

Michael, I need you to look at me!

Michael! Michel, don't be dead.

Michael! Breathe!

Sharon, he's...
Michael!

Too much.

Try, Michael.

Michael!

Michael!

Please.

We were in the hospital, we could of...

I just need...

Leave him here. Don't touch the body.
What's wrong with you?

John! Don't go!

We're gonna bury him, right? I mean,

we're not just gonna leave him lying there like...

It's my turn, we're gonna bury him for it.
Something is happening on the 18th, that is tomorrow.

We don't have time. I'm gonna to the...
Wait!

I think we should all stay together.
Yeah.

To be honest, I'm not sure.

Neither am I.

Lukas?

Nathan, come on.

We need to stick together.
I won't make that call.

I didn't have keys.

I can push-start your car. Can I please have your key?

Thank you.

I will go.
What?

No one should go alone.

Come on now.

It's already there.

Okay, now!

Yes. Here we go. Hup, okay.

Stop! Stop!

Hey, up there on the left.

Hello!

It's too quiet.

This is empty.

Yeah! This, too.

Did you see that?
No, what?

There's a kid.
Where?

Hello!

Hello!

Hello!

Goddamn it, there's no one.

Sharon?

What's your name?

Come on, open the door.

Do you-Do you recognize me?

Do you recognize this lady?

Go away, Jonah, they're coming tomorrow.

No.
No, no, come back, please.

No.
No, he knows me.

He-He-He called me Jonah.

All these languages and not one of them yours.

Okay? Hey?

Let me help you.

Get over here.

What's up?

Piece of crap!

My head.

I know you.

I know you.

Okay. Lukas?

Lukas, stop it, you're...Lukas, get off of her.

Lukas!

Stop it, stop it!

Okay.

Hey, relax.

Lukas, stop. Stop it!

Okay.

Are you okay now?

I'm okay.

I'm okay.

I can hear him, Sharon. He's still in there.

Fuck yourself.

Hey!

Call your dog off.

It's okay.

I'm not kidding around now, buddy. Call this dog off.

I'm gonna sic my dog on you, Digger not here.

Don't test me. Don't fuckin' test me.

Just-Just-Just open the door.
Okay. Yes, Just..

Go away!
What are you doing?

Stand back.
Stop it.

He knows me.
Jesus!

Leave us alone, Jonah!

But he cannot get away!

Do you hear that? I'm not going away.
Stop it!

Here.
Darn you.

Stay out of this, Sharon.
Stop it!

Stay out of this.
Stop it!

Jake, this isn't helping, please. This is not gonna help.

Stand back.
Jesus!

How do you know me?
I don't need to see you,

Let me go. Let me go.

Please, please we do need some answers. Okay, please.

Please, you can come out.

Damn it.

Out of the way!

I can feel it.

Stop! What the fuck are you doing?

I'm gonna cut the fucking door.
It's a child!

He knows me. He knows my name.

I, eh, I don't even know my name.

This isn't  you.

Okay, symptoms.

Headache, nausea, hyper-ventilating.

Marisus.

Violent.

Yes. Do you think that...?

I wish I could speak your language.

Well, erh, there was a woman.

She was-She was tied up.

She was blind in one eye.

She had, eh, eh, bad eye.

The one you were feeding. They told me about it.

Yeah.

I need your help.

Please help me.

I know this place.

She escaped.

I think there's a path around the lake.

I need to know where it leads.

I'm goin'.

My name is Nathan. Nathan.

Nathan's my name.

I remember.

You called me Nate.

Trees, cracked by lightning.

Two trees.

Either side of the path.

And...And...

Tree trunk.

I'm in the front.
Nate!

What is happening is your fault.

No, I never even...
...a fucking babysister.

Stop it, you...

Stop it!
...a cyclops.

Not my fuckin' fault.

I didn't do this. I didn't do any of this.

You have the only type. Come on, help me, Nathan.

Nathan, act like normal.
Vicki.

John, handle this.

You married?

You know.

Don't leave me alone, please.

Not going to hurt you.

Don't leave me alone.

I know I can trust you.

You can trust me.

I had your hand.

I remember you smiling at me.

I remember you.

Let me innn!

I'm not going to hurt you.

Helen.

Your name is Helen.

I'm sorry about-about your daughter.

We wanted to help.

Day 96, eh, this is subject 143,

who I captured in the woods.

He's the first positive result that I've had, and, eh,

he's responding to the injection, I believe.

It proves that I'm onto something.

And then, eh, one unfortunate side
effect is a period of unconsciousness.

followed by acute memory loss, but...

You don't remember anything.

...two stages that he's going...the
first stage is a rest cycle...he looks, eh,

...calm, almost dead...heartbeat
decreases to thirty beats per minute...

I don't know why it's wearing off so quickly...

I-I just...I need it to hold.

I need it to hold.

Why is he not responding? It should work! It should work.

Look, I'm trying everything.

Her blood should...

Now you can see...

It looks like...

Something from in his head...

He's got increased strength.

Do you remember your family?

I can't remember my mother, who
doesn't remember their own mother?

I know that I know you.

I feel like I know you.

Sometimes, I, eh...

I feel like I might of...

I've done some things I wasn't proud of.

That I might not...like the man I was, you know?

Watch out!

Where the hell did that come from?

What's that sound?

Be careful, I've got a bad feeling about this.

Don't...I don...
Excuse me!

I don't like it.

Excuse me!
No! Shhh.

Let's go.

Please...
Okay, maybe you were right.

Come on.

Come on.

Oh, my God, they're coming.

Please! Get out of here! Get out of here!
Fuck it!

Put it in reverse. Put it in reverse.

Goddamn it. They're right on me.
They're right on me...Goddamn...

What?

They don't like this.

The smell or something.

It's just hysterical.

Someone hung 'em up on purpose.

They're being used like scarecrows.

Be careful.

You're a sick fuck.

I knew it was you.

Lukas, put your fuckin' gun down,
man. You're losing your mind.

What you did to me?

Who are you?
What are you talking about, man?

Lukas...what are you doing?

It's him, Shar.

That's all I need.

I told you. You shouldn't have let him out.

He was doing experiments on us, or something.

He had us all in prison.

He's a murderer.

John?

What's he talking about?

What's on the tape?

I-I don't know.

I can't remember.

I was-I was trying to tell you, in the car, and...

I've been having some memories...

Bad memories, of doing really bad things.

For God's sake, Sharon. Can you trust me, please.

I wanted to tell you.

...I just know how. I saw it...

You knew me and, like I knew you, and...

Sharon?
Please, I was hoping...

maybe I was somebody else, because I knew you.

Please.

You stay back!
I just...

Okay.

You don't fuckin' move or I shoot you where you stand

and hang you from the next fuckin' tree.

Watch it. Come on, Sharon. Watch it!

Have a look.

What is it, Shar?

What's on the tape?

I have some needle marks on my arm.

See?

I bet they're on you, too.

What's that? Is that for me?

Lukas, Goddamn...
You shut the fuck up!

Okay.

I don't remember. Did I do that?

Lukas, did I do this to her?

I'll kill you.

I just want to know what I did. I'm
not sure. I remember pieces, but I don't...

Lukas, please listen to me. Okay, I will-I
will turn around. And I wouldn't hurt you.

No.
Sharon, please don't hate...

You crawl.

Get into the pit with all your victims.

Twisted fuck!

No, not in there, man. Come on.

Go!
No!

Okay. Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

Lukas!

Take it yourself.

Who are you?

Did you get blood in your mouth?

We'll try, okay? We'll try.

We'll pack up and get the fuck out of this.

Give me your key. Give me your
keys. I'll go and get your car.

What about Nathan?

Did he know?

Who?

Nathan.

No, no.

The one in the pit is the one who did this.

It's-It's John.

Lukas.

You okay?
No, I'm not okay.

I'm all fucked up.

Because your Nazi boyfriend's doing experiments on me.

Lukas.

You need to sit down. You don't look well.

No, no. You're safe with me.

You are safe now.

Do you hear me? You're safe with me.

I...I'll take care of you. Okay?

Lukas.

My hand...
You're scaring me, okay?

I'll take care of you, too.

You're safe with me.

They tried to take you away from me, but you're safe now.

Lukas. Please.

Hit me.

You're sick.
I'm okay.

I'm okay.

Lukas.
Don't touch him!

I told you. They won't protect you.

Remember.

Where are you?

Look at me. Look at me!

Look at me!!

Remember me. You love me.

You know me!!

Beautiful girl.

Get off of her!

March the 18th.

There's no time left.

The kid knew me.

We need to get back to that building.

You need to stay away from me, I
may not be safe to be around you.

I need answers.

Get in the house.

Go!

Jonah?

Hello?

Please be careful with this.

This is our last chance.

We only have a couple of days.

Last chance.

Last chance for what?

The 18th.

Come on, man, think. What happens on the 18th?

You have to follow the main road.

They'll meet you there.

Do not stop for any...

Where were you going?

Goddamn it, who were you meeting? Come on, man.

You have to follow the main road.
Fuck!

...fuck is going on?

I'm not gonna hurt you.

I just need to get 'em.

Give 'em to me.

Just hand 'em to me, you crazy bitch.

No, no. No!

You gotta be kidding me.

Jonah!

You!
Hey.

Do you know me?

'Cause...that kid knows me.

You are one of them. Stay away from my family.

No more needles.

Is this your daughter?

You hurt us all, Jonah.

I leave you your life, 'coz I'm not like you.

Run and hide.
What?

What do you mean?

Wait, hang on, hang on. Listen. Wait.

Wait, wait, listen, please. Just hang on.

I just want to talk to you.

Please, just tell me. What did I do?

Please, I just want to talk to you!

Where are you going?

Overgrown brain.

Possible reason for a headache.

White matter is decomposing.

The army will meet you there.
They know what to do with it.

The army.

What does the military have to do with this?

You're Jonah Cook.

Jonah Cook.

Sharon?

Stop!

Stop!

Lukas.

You suppose that you're sick.

Calm down, man. This will help you.

I was helping you.
Go away.

Lukas, I was helping you!

I was helping all of you.

Lukas? Lukas?

I'm remembering things. My name is-is Jonah.

Do you remember me, I'm a doctor. You've been infected.

I need to inject you with this.

It can help you.

Look at me, you remember me. Look at me.

Look at me, look at me, look at me.
Please, just give me your arm.

I was just trying to help. The dose has worn off.

I need...No, no!

Come on, man!

Lukas.

Fuck!

...help you, Lukas!

Lukas? Come on.

I need you to...Lukas.

Look at me, look at me.

Stay with me, stay with me, come on.

I ...

I have a headache in my head

And I cannot run away from it.

I know you...Jonah.

Yeah. Yeah, I know you, too. Come on.

I know you. Look at me.

Look at me. I know you.

I want to say thank you, Jonah, and

to all of you for saving my life.

And, also, you give me my memory back. I...

I've really missed them. Well, most of them.

Memories.
To memory.

To memory.
Memory.

How'd she get out, Nathan?

Nathan, did you lock up?

Go check the other cell. Be careful.

They haven't all been treated.

Why am I here, Jonah? Why am I here?

You gonna play big brother, now?

Don't go down there!
It's my fault!

It's not my fuckin' fault. I didn't do this.

I didn't do any of this.

Help me figure it next time.

Take it yourself.

Jonah.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Jonaaaaah!

Jonaaah!

Jonaaah!

Sharon.

It's me.

It's me.

I remember.

What was that?

Tell me what to do!
Get down!

Come on. Come on, Shar. Come on.

Where is...forgotten what the purpose
or source? Do you copy, do you read?

They're everywhere. They're out of
control. They've escaped. Do you copy?

Michael, gather the group up
in the house and inject yourselves.

That's crazy. It's not finished. We didn't test it.

Sharon! Sharon, listen. You've no time.
You have to inject yourself. If you...

Oh, shit!

I've been bit.

We're not going to remember.

My name is Jonah...

No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on.

Okay.

All right.

Did you see that?

Yes. Okay.

Where'd they come from?

Scarecrows didn't stop 'em.

Oh, my God, they're everywhere.

Take this, kill some.

Here we go. Go!

Oh, my God!

Fuck!

Shit!

I had to tell Jonah.

Jesus!

Just in case he doesn't remember.

In case we don't make it.

We are here to help.

But we failed.

The plague spread.

Sharon.

Sharon, please remember.

The 18th, we're out of time.

They're coming.

They're coming.

18.

The rescue party.

They're coming on the 18th, the dawn of the 18th.

The 18th. We're...Hey!

Hey! Don't shoot!

We're-We're safe.
Are we?

It's over.

Sharon, it's over. Hey!

We're alive in here!

Don't shoot.

Sharon! Come on!

Come on!

Hey! We're alive!

Hello?

Standing by for orders.

Green light. No survivors.

There was, of course, no rescuers.

Please.

No, wait.

I'm so sorry. I'm...

I remember.

I remember

That was my brother. That was my brother.

Sorry.

Wait. Wait, we need her...

Sharon?

Sweetest! Oh! Oh God!

You okay?

Is she dead, too?

Fuck!

Put this on, put this on. Hold on.

Come on, the soldiers are coming.
We need to hide. Come on, come on.

Hurry up, they're coming. Come on, we gotta hide.

Come on, come on. That's it.

There, that's it.

Come on, come on.

Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

Hang on. Hang on.

I have to stop the bleeding.

Look at me. They will find us.

Okay. Give me your arm, 

Jonah?
give me your arm. I need your arm.

We're just gonna hide.

And we'll pretend we're dead, then wake up, okay?

Jonah.
Yes.

Jonah, listen to me.

What is this?
You have to read it.

Jonah. Remember this. Read it.

This time, you have to do it right. Please.

Hey. I mean seriously.

Please, you will tell them. Don't forget.

Please!

I love you.

I will never forget you.

I love you, too. We need to sleep, okay.
I know you.

I'm scared.

I don't want to die.
You won't die.

You won't die. This will work. I won't forget you.

I'm Jonah.

My name is Jonah.

Unit 2, return back to base.

My love,

I remembered everything.

We were doctors on the verge of finding a cure

for an awful plague that has cast the world into darkness.

Help me! Please, help me!

The mute woman is the answer.

Her blood is immune to the virus.

You must protect her.

You'll find death and madness everywhere.

And you have to fight to finish what we started.

We have no time, Jonah.

There are still people waiting to be saved.

I know your memory will come back to you.

When it does...

Remember I love you.
