Piece of shit.

Expecting company, Rollins?

That's your little lady friend
coming over for the night?

Huh?

Zip it, Jelly.

I ain't in the mood
for your shit tonight.

Well whoever they are,
I hope they brought snacks.

I'm hungry as a
motherfucker, man.

Deputy Rollins?

And you are?

Soaking wet.

Freezing.

Mind if I come in?

Yeah.

Thanks.

Henderson County?

Unfortunately.

It's a little drafty in
here, don't you think?

Sorry, I'm Deputy Adams.

Don't mean to drop
in on you like this,

but in the current state I
didn't have much of a choice.

You drove all the way
out here in this storm?

Yeah.

It was coming down in sheets
when I got off the bridge.

I could hardly see three
feet in front of me.

The roads are about to
flood, so I had to pull over.

Where are you headed?

Huntington.

Transporting a suspect.

Huntington.

Uh-huh.

That's five hours from here.

Yep.

Like I said, the roads
are starting to flood.

Got the suspect.

I figured what better place
to hole up than a county jail.

For the night?
Is that a problem?

No, no.

I'll call the sheriff
and square it all away.

Be my guest.

Good luck getting through
to anyone in this, though.

Look, I'm not trying
to cause any issues.

Just let me lock up my guy.

As soon as this storm clears,

I'll get out of your hair, yeah?

What kind of offender?

The violent kind.

And?

Murder.

Where's all your people?

It's just me on the weekends.

I'm new.

Just transferred from records.

So being the last man
on the totem pole,

it's just me and
Jelly for the weekend.

Who's Jelly?

God damn, Rollins, you
lucky son-of-a-gun, you.

Henderson County, huh?

I need to spend more
time down there.

That's enough, Jelly.

Is Jelly his real name?

No.

Why do you call him that?

Come on in
here and I'll show you.

He's in for indecent exposure.

The sheriff wanted to get him
in front of a judge today,

but the storm took
care of all that.

So he's with us for the weekend.

Lucky you.

Yeah.

He likes to wiggle
his, uh, you know.

Yeah.

Yeah.
I got that.

So my guy, you got another
cell block I can use?

What's wrong with this one?

Yeah, what's
wrong with this.

Shut up.
All right.

My guy don't play
well with others.

Well we've got the women's
block but there's issues

with the locks.

We'll put him in Block B.

How's that?

As long as nobody
fucks with him.

I don't think it
will be a problem.

All right.

I'll bring him in.

What the hell did
you say this guy is in for?

Murder.

What kind?

The triple kind.

Twice.

What the hell is this?

That's his property.

Well, I can lock it in the
cage for you, if you want.

Do you have anything
to eat around here?

Don't get your hopes up.

The damn thing just eats change.

Let me try.

This is the last of it.

You were saying?

How the hell did you do that?

A woman's touch.

Do you have anywhere where I
can rest my eyes for a bit?

Smart ass.

Psst.

Hey, man.

What did they get you for?

You know me, they got me for
rocking out with my cock out.

You know what I mean, huh?

Guess not.

How about that fine-ass lady
cop you came in here with, huh?

Man.

Rollins is a lucky dog,
I'll tell you that.

Spend the night with here, whew.

Did you try anything
freaky with her?

Anything?

Nothing?

Not even during the patdown?

Dude, that's like
the best opportunity.

I guess not.

Hey you know, that reminds me

of a friend I had over
in Granbury one time.

So get this.

He gets pulled over, right.

Apparently he fucks his
way out of the ticket.

I mean, if that's true, that
shit is pretty epic, huh?

Well, he was known to
over-exaggerate things a little bit,

so,

you don't talk much, do you?

I get that.

Yeah.

Neither does Rollins.

I swear the guy's got
a stick up his ass.

Well either way I hope
you ate before you came

because apparently
the kitchen is closed.

Yeah, the cook went
home or some shit.

Everybody is freaked
out over the storm.

Man, I tell you what,

I'm so fucking hungry
I could eat my watch.

But that would be
time consuming.

Nothing?

Damn, man.

You got that wrapped up tight.

Just talking to
myself here, Jelly.

All alone.

Hey, man, you got any toilet
paper in there with you?

You know, the stuff that they
give you when you book in?

It's paper thin.

I mean mid-swipe your
finger breaks through,

goes right up your ass.

You know.

Nothing?

Not even a handkerchief?

Tissue?

It's kind of an emergency.

Extra pillowcase?

Come on, man.

Help me out here.

Oh shit.

Well it ain't the Ritz.

Well like I said,
everybody went home,

so we should be alone.

Welcome to paradise.

What's with
all the empty offices?

Layoffs.

The county is moving
all those departments

by the end of the month.

Shit.
Yeah.

Well this works.

I just need to get a
couple of hours of shuteye.

Wake me if anything happens.

What would happen?

On second thought,
maybe I should.

No, I
got it, I got it.

It's my cell, my responsibility.

Well he's my suspect.

So tell me about him.

You could write a fucking
movie about that guy.

Kids.

A woman in her 70s.

It makes no difference to him.

When I found him, he was
sleeping a dumpster, with nothing

on him but a knife and these.

Risperdal.

The same shit they give
psychopaths and serial killers

when they're trying to calm
them down for questioning.

I know what it is.

I cleaned out the
infirmary last spring.

He killed six people?

Yeah.

A bus driver, a family
of three and two others.

When we pulled him
out of the dumpster,

brought him in for questioning,
he confessed, to all of it.

Just like that?
Yep.

That's strange, right?

Yeah.

I was bringing him to
Huntington for his psych eval,

and that's when El Nino
happened, so here we are.

Is he a rancher?

I doubt it.

No ranchers I know have that
much time for killing sprees.

Like I said, he don't
play well with others,

so, I don't mind staying up.

No, I got it.

I'll take care of it.

I can handle it.

Jelly and I will
hold down the fort.

Jelly?

Yeah.

He's a good guy.

He just has an unhealthy
obsession with his pecker,

that's all.

Okay.

Hey, do you have
any paperwork I can file

for all this shit?

I ain't going out in this storm
to get you damn paperwork.

Besides I'll be out of you
hair before you have time

to file it.

Fair enough.

Hey, the infirmary?

They got any meds in there?

Just aspirin and mild sedatives.

Why?

I feel a cold coming on.

I'll see if I can get
you some dry clothes.

No way.

You got it to work?

Magic touch.

What do you want for it?

You gonna keep your
dick in your pants

while we got guests?

Fuck it.

Yeah, whatever you say, man.

Come on.

Okay.
I love you, Rollins.

Yeah, I bet you do.

Don't say I didn't
do nothing for you.

Love you.
Yeah.

Did you really kill
all those people?

Hey!

I'm talking to you.

Silence is golden.

Hey, Rollins.

What?

I've got to
drop a deuce, man.

Tough shit.

I mean, it's
a real code brown

over here, you know?

It's a big thumper dumper
four emergency, bro.

Hurry every chance you get.

What the hell is it?

Can you hurry me out,
I've got to shit.

I've got to shit real bad.

What's wrong with the
toilet in your cell?

Oh nothing.

It's lovely.

Fine facilities.

There's just no toilet paper.

What am I supposed to
wipe my ass with, huh?

Sit tight.

Where are you going?
I'll get you some.

Hey!

Hey!

Get up!

Up!

Up!

Get up!

Hands against the wall!

Hands against the wall!

Don't move.

Stay there.

Stay right there.

Jesus fucking Christ.

Oh my God.

Get your fucking head
up against the wall.

Right there.

Don't you fucking move.

Hey.

Hey, Rollins.

Rollins, what's going on?

Don't move!

You've got
to talk to me, man.

Stay right there.

Don't move!

Getting a little
worried over here.

You stay right there.

You stay right there!

Hey, where are you going?

Where are you going, Rollins?

Rollins, don't leave me
in here with this guy.

Rollins.

What happened?

What happened?

Where have you been?

Where the hell is the
bathroom in this place?

The bathroom?

Come with me.

You need to see something.

Ohhhh.

How long has he been like that?

10, maybe 15 minutes.

Singing that damn song
the whole time, too.

Hey!

Hey, shut up with that.

What about the arm?

I told you, he's
putting holes in it.

Didn't you search him when
you took him into custody?

Huh?

Is that how they do it
in Henderson County?

What the fuck is it
with both of you all?

I talk to him; He doesn't
say a god-damned thing.

I talk to you, you don't
say a fucking thing either.

I want to hear
some answers, now.

Just not here.

Whoaaa.

Shit, shit, shit.

I didn't think the smokes
where that big of a deal,

given the gravity
of the situation.

Situation?

The luck it took to
bring that motherfucker

in after three years on the run.

Two of my guys lost their
lives to that motherfucker.

I was sparing you
the details earlier,

but those other two that
he killed, they were cops.

Jesus.

I wasn't going to let
anyone bring him in.

And I was racing the
storm on top of all that,

and I just, I fucked up.

All right?

But it is what it is.

Don't tell me you never
cut corners trying

to get where you're at.

Okay.

The Risperdal keeps
him stable, right?

Why don't we just
give it to him?

Keep him calm for the next few
hours till the storm passes

and you two can get
the fuck out of here.

No way.
Why not?

Because that lunatic is
somehow more dangerous

on that shit.

Trust me, I've seen it.

He's a fucking loose cannon.

He'd kill us all before
midnight given the chance.

You don't think I can hold
him another eight hours,

do you?

I didn't say that.

Yeah, you did.

Maybe not with your
mouth, but you did.

Huh?

That little comment
about cutting corners.

All I'm saying,

is you don't know that slippery
motherfucker like I do.

Listen, I'm sorry.

All right?

I didn't plan on
bringing him here.

Shit happens.

But this is what you
signed up for, right?

Better than pushing
record cards all day.

Either you're a deputy or
you're just pretending to be.

You have to make that
fucking choice tonight.

Hey, look, uh,

hey, Mr. Marlborough Man.

You know, I know you've
had a busy day and all,

but your friend Jelly
over has got an emergency.

Is there any chance you can
roll me your toilet paper?

I'm begging you, man.

I'm in a lot of pain over here.

Oh, yes.

No, no, no, no, no.

Oh, got it.

Listen, my friend.

I don't care what Rollins
and pretty coplady say,

you're a saint.

You're a lifesaver.

I love you.

I owe you one, man.

I really do.

Whew.

Oh God, oh.

Whew.

So Russell, tell me
everything about him.

He wet the bed until he was 15.

That was the first sign
something wasn't right.

He spent his teen years
lighting things on fire.

Just any inanimate
object he could find.

It was just small
stuff at first,

but like any junkie,
the sensation fades.

Right?

He moved on to bigger stuff.

Animals.

He used to film it, too.

You can just about
guess the rest.

Impulsivity, a need for control,

sheer lack of guilt and remorse.

Plus his parents used to
just think he was special.

The shrink went for it.

It's crazy how something can
be right in front of your face

and you just don't see it.

Pisces?

What?

Well I read most serial killers,

they usually kind of
turn out to be Pisces.

Well, what are you?

Me?

I'm a Leo.

Shit.

It's okay, it's
just the breaker.

This building is
over 50 years old.

Backup will come on any minutes.

How do you know?

See?

But the cell doors?

They're on a different breaker.

It should be okay as
long as it stays on.

So you don't know for sure?

Shit.

Where are you going?

Oh.

You've got to be kidding me.

The day just keeps
getting better and better.

Hey, Rollins?

You out here?

This isn't funny, man.

Marlborough Guy?

Anybody?

What the fuck's happening?

Oh, fuck.

He's gone.

So's Jelly.

Oh, man.

So the cell doors, they
were knocked offline

because of the storm.

What about the exits?

Windows?

Doors?

Rollins, the exits?

Exit doors only
open with my key.

Storm or no storm.

No one gets out of
unless I say so.

All right, so he's
locked in with us.

Jesus, is that a good thing?

I sure as shit ain't
spending another three years

of my life tracking him down.

Shit.

God damn it.

What are we going to do?

The lines are down.

Can't call for backup.

You're sure he's
locked in here, right?

That's right.

He'll be looking to kill us.

Just for the fucking
inconvenience we've caused.

He won't be happy with just
one body under his belt.

And he'll be looking for these.

It's his fix.

So we stick together
at all times, right?

We can clear this building
room by room until we find him.

Then we'll lock him somewhere

where the locks
can't go offline.

Either that, or we kill him.

Kill him?

It's better than him killing us.

Yeah.

Fuck, does this
place have an armory?

I got this out of the squad car.

Oh, thanks.

So this is it?

This is all the
firepower you've got?

Yeah, we're a small county.

We don't have any action here.

Okay, good.

At least we know he
don't have a gun.

Wait.

The hat.

The fucking knife.

Yeah, how do you think
he killed your friend

in Cell Block A?

He got in when the door
was knocked offline.

God damn it.

So, where do we start?

Lead the way.

Clear.

Clear.

Clear.

Are you clear?

Nothing.

It's clear.

Check that one right there.

Clear.

Clear.

Clear.

It's clear.

Clear.

It's locked.

The sheriff's
already cleared out.

Check it anyway.

It's clear.

Check it out.

Here we go.

It's just mice.

It's just mice.

Fucking rats.

Oh shit, you scared me.

You scared me.

Me, too.

Get down!

Get down!

Fuck!

Are you all right?

Ah!

The fucker just cut my neck.

You'll be fine.

Did he get away?

Yeah.

We need a way to
section this area off.

How the hell are we
going to do that?

Can you lock this corridor down?

By hand.

Okay, do it.

I'll cover you.

We'll keep him out of this wing.

Did you see that
handprint on the wall?

He's hit.

If we're lucky it
will set off a trail.

Follow the blood.

All right.

That's it.

Let's do it.

All right.

That takes care of the north
end and the women's block.

So he's not in any
of those two places.

I locked the cage.

He can't get back in
there without a key.

I'm going to try
the phones again.

See if I can't get a line out.

You know it's useless, right?

Well excuse me for trying.

Better than being stuck here

with Russel Fucking
Scissorhands.

Nice.

I told you.

God damn it!

It's been hours since
it started raining.

They don't call it

the storm of the
decade for nothing.

Where are we going to go now?

We just keep clearing
the building.

It's two against
one, we'll find him.

Some fucking first day.

Yeah.

You know I was about to call in.

Take the weekend
to think it over.

Go to the stockyards.

Stockyards?

Yeah.

Cowboy camp.

I used to sleep there on the
weekends when I was younger.

During the summer.

You were a cowboy?

Was.

Tell me why you became a cop.

What?

Why?

Just do it.

I think we have bigger
fucking problems here.

I mean of all the places to
go and start a life, why here?

Where am I going to go?

I was born in this town.

That's the way it is.

You start a life here,
it ends the same way.

My family's been doing
it for generations.

I figured being a deputy
was the best thing

to do for the community.

A way to give back to something
that's given so much to me.

Given so much to you?

Like what?

You know, like what?

Help me understand
what you mean.

You see right through
it, don't you, Adams?

I stayed for my father, family.

Truth be told, I wanted
to be a team roper.

I wanted to travel.

I wanted to do anything
besides grow up

and live in a shithole town
like this the rest of my life.

But life finds a way
of getting in front

of the things you want
and makes you settle

for the things you need.

So what did your daddy think
about your new career choice?

Don't matter what he thinks.

He's dead.

But he'd have done anything
to keep me off of that rope.

Keep me off of the arena.

Living that life that he led.

But I fell for it,
hook, line and sinker.

Why wouldn't he want you
to follow in his footsteps?

Hard living.

Ain't no money in it.

Well if you don't
know what you want,

you ain't never
going to find it.

You'll always settle for less.

You'll wander around
aimlessly wondering

how the hell did
life land me here?

How do you know this?

Huh?

Your vast experience?

I was talking about you.

Not me.

Tell me.

I'm a Texas gal.

Coke really means Doctor Pepper.

Can't have the Alamo
without "Lonesome Dove",

and all the roses are yellow.

I like a beer just as
much as the next guy but,

Rollins, what I am
ain't about valor.

I live my life
like my daddy did.

His daddy before him.

Eight seconds at a time.

Only I do it with the
fucking handbreak off.

Come on.

We've still got work to do.

How long have you
been a deputy, Adams?

Longer than you.

Everybody's been a
deputy longer than me.

Six years.

You spent half of your
career chasing this asshole?

Something like that.

Ready?

Yeah.

It's the weight room.

We circled back around.

I'm right behind you.

Anything?

Nothing.

All right.

Let's knock it off the list.

You can lock the
door on our way out.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

What is it?

I don't fucking
know, but I heard it.

Whoa!

Where are you going?

I heard someone in the hall.

Yeah, no shit.

But what did you say?

Stick together, right?

Don't tell me you're
afraid of the dark.

First we check here,
then we'll check there.

Okay?

Together.

All right?

Excuse me.
Fuck.

Adams?

Adams!

Adams, open the fucking door!

Adams!

Adams, open the fucking door!

Adams!

Fucking bitch!

Fuck!

What did she tell you about me?

Where is it?

Where is it?

I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

You don't know what
I'm talking about,

you are so full of shit,
your eyes are brown.

Son, I can tell
when a man is lying.

I'm looking at
your fucking eyes.

You are a liar.

Fuck you.

I should tell you, these work.

Where the fuck
did you get those?

Huh?

What the fuck did
you do with her?

Hey.

I'm asking the questions.

You are tied to a
fucking chair by me.

Fuck you.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Hey, look at me.

You wanted to fuck
her, didn't you?

Fuck you!
Yep.

You thought you was
going to fuck her.

I tell you what, you respect
me, or you respect this.

Now you tell me
where the fuck it is.

Right now.

Or so help me, God, you will
not have blue eyes anymore,

you get me?

Okay, okay.

Okay!

Okay what?
Okay.

Just get Adams.

Get Adams.

Get Adams!

Adams!

You want me to get Adams?

Get Adams.
And bring her here?

She'll know what
you're looking for.

Yes.

She can help you find it, man.

She can fucking
help you find it.

Interesting.

Well, I guess I
better go get Adams.

Okay.

Motherfucker.

Here she is, pretty boy.

Adams, stay.

All right, your boy here
wants to play games,

so let's play some
fucking games.

Please tell him where they are.

How about Operation.

That's fun and games.

Wait.

This is your last chance.

No.

Please don't.

Wait!

We'll give you
whatever you want, man.

I still don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

Tell him where it is, Rollins.

Please, just tell
him where it is.

Tell him where it is, Rollins.

Please.

What?
You have to.

What the fuck are
you talking about?

He's going to kill me.

Please.

Wait!

All right.

I was in records, man.

I know where everything
is in this building, okay.

Okay?

Okay?

Okay.

Okay.

Yeah.

We're gonna find it.

We're gonna find it.

I just don't know
what it is yet.

This bitch knows.

What?

The buckle.

What?
The belt buckle.

What the fuck are
you talking about?

Whoops.

You went a little
heavy, don't you think?

You said
make it believable.

You two motherfuckers.

You're in it together, huh?

Surprise.

Abner Outlaw.

You know him?

Of course you do.

All those nights spent
at the cowboy camp.

You heard the stories, right?

I know them.

So what?

So you know that Abner could
do anything in the arena.

Generation after generation
of championship rodeo.

And just like all the Texas
Rangers before him, he wore it

on his belt.

One buckle more than the rest.

His great grandfather's
1920 gold-plated Cow Palace.

I don't have anything
to do with that.

I think you do, records boy.

He was here three weeks ago.

He came in on D and D.

He spent a night in
the tank on his way

to Colorado Springs
for a PRCA auction.

When he booked in,
he had the buckle.

And when he checked out, gone.

Why don't you just ask him?

Hmm?

We know that it's
here, record boy.

Abner had a suit
against your sheriff

and this county because
it was stolen here.

By who?

I've got nothing
to do with this.

I'm fucking brand new.

Smart money says you
know where they hid it.

Who?

Your sheriff.

Why the fuck would he
do something like that?

Because Abner Outlaw's buckle,
sold to the right buyer

is worth over a quarter
of a million dollars.

You planned this.

You've been planning
this all night.

Well he's finally catching on.

Yeah, you know what?

I've been planning
this night all week.

So here's what's
going to happen.

You're going to take me
to the property room,

because you know
where that is, right?

You know where they hide things

they don't want no
one else to see.

Right?

Crazy bitch.

And one more thing.

Ah, Jesus fucking Christ!

Jesus Christ!

Why the fuck did you do that?

You crazy bitch.

Three is a crowd.

But look on the bright side,

if you play your cards right,

you might get his share.

You smell good.

So you want to have some fun?

Hey, whoa.

I said property.

This is your office.

I know that.

You think if he wanted
a $250,000 belt buckle

he'd just leave it
out in the open?

I'm looking for keys
to the basement.

Was any of it true?

Russell?

The pills?

Jesus Christ, are you
even a real fucking cop?

Russell is crazy.

Well, he was crazy.

I met him up in Reno.

He came in handy
when he needed to.

He was a fucking junkie.

He'd sell that buckle
in three months

and be out on the street,
looking to score again.

Can't trust a guy like that.

As for me, I'm a rodeo girl.

Rodeo?

Yeah.

You and me, we have
something in common.

Two peas in a pod.

I grew up on a horse farm.

I still love to ride.

Dressage, events and
jumping, all of it.

The problem was, the minute
the oil rigs dried up,

my daddy lost it all.

The farm.

300 acres.

The house not long after that.

The horses were all that
we had left to sell,

and that's what we did.

I guess it's a no-brainer.

The choice between livestock
and putting food on the table.

So that's what
all this is about?

Jesus.

And I thought I
had daddy issues.

I traded horse trials
for tie-down calf roping,

so don't you fucking
tell me about issues.

Most the guys my age couldn't
hang for as long as I did.

So what happened?

I heard all the
same story as you.

Outlaw's stuck.

I laid the charge
on breaker myself.

And you in here alone.

A deputy for all of 36 hours.

Easy to convince.

And Jelly?

Who the fuck cares?

Right?

Collateral damage.

Shit happens.

Yeah, I got it.

Now there looks like
there's a reason

for both of us to get
the belt buckle, huh?

Isn't that right?

Oh, no.

That buckle is mine.

You've been planning
this night all week?

I've been planning
this shit all month.

Oh, shit.

First night on the job, eh?

Hmm.

The rain stopped.

I guess we have a
decision to make.

Not really.

I ain't going in
with no partner.

Put the gun down and
get on your knees.

No chance.

You have me pegged
all wrong, Adams.

You don't know a thing about me.

Well I do know you're just
pretending to be a cop.

Kind of like me.

You shouldn't have come here.

Fuck.

Adams!

Where are you?

Oh, Adams.

Jelly is looking for you.

Where are you, you crazy bitch?

Adams.

Oh, shit!

Die, bitch, die!

Get up.

Get up!

Against the wall.

Against the wall.

Whoa, little lamb.

You're under arrest.

You have the right
to remain silent.

Anything you say can and
will be used against you

in a court of law.

You piece of shit.

How long did it take
you to learn that?

Come on, motherfucker.

Rollins.

Fucking wild animal.

Oh, Rollins.

Shut up.
No, no, no.

You- - Shh.

Hey, hey you don't- - Shh.

Shh.

You don't have to
put me in there.

Oh, no?

Why?

Why not?

No please.

Please don't put me
in there- Oh, no.

You'll like it in there with

all that mumbo jumbo the fuck

you were talking about earlier?

Huh?

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

What, what?

Hey, what?

Why?

If you had- - Huh?

If you had it this
whole time, why did you,

why did you wait?

Why?

Well, before you killed him
Jelly was my escape plan.

All he had to do
was take that buckle

and meet me after my shift.

I had his charges dropped.

Fuck all that now, huh?

You trusted him?

Yeah, more than you.

Get your fucking ass in there.

Fucking animal.

Turn around.

Is that how you like it?

Shut the fuck up,
you sick freak.

Turn around.

After all this is over,
I suggest you get help.

All right.

If you fucking
need anything, Hey!

Get your shit out of my face.

Rollins, Rollins,
Rollins, Rollins,

Rollins, Rollins, Rollins.

Whew whee.

Look at that.

Just, just let me.

Is this was everybody died for?

Just let me touch it.

I just want to
touch it one time.

Just let- Get your
hands out of here.

It ain't much when
you look at it.

It's a damn shame.

Well, adios, Adams.

Hey, hey.

What are you, what are you
going to tell the sheriff?

Let me think.

I'm not.

You are.

Rollins.

You and me, you and
me, we could be a team.

No, no.

You're a smart girl.

You'll figure something out.

Rollins, Rollins!
Fuck you.

Fuck!

Rollins.

Rollins.

Oh, Rollins.

Hey, cowboy.

Rollins.

Give it to me.

Uh-uh.

Fucking snake.

Looks like we have
a decision to make.

What do you propose?

You let me out.

Yeah?

Then we can settle it up.

50-50.

70-30.

Nope, nope.

No, no, no, no, no.

No!

I have the key.

50-50.

Fuck you.

Stay in there.

I don't give a shit.

Okay, okay, okay.

Yeah, yeah.

Okay.

Because then the sheriff
comes and nobody wins.

We sell it when I want.

To who I want.

Where I want.

Do you understand that?

Say it!

Sir, yes, sir.

I should have my
fucking head checked.

You and I are going to
have some fun together.

No we aren't.

Yeah.

Fucking bitch.

You know, Rollins, I'm curious.

Is that how you do
it in Tarrant County.

Hmm?

Is that how you
search your suspects?

Bitch.

Yeah.

Well, I'm out.

You shouldn't mess
with a Texas girl.

Later, gator.

Yes.

No, I understand.

Well I have seller
with me at the moment.

So I'm going to have
to get back to you.

Understood.

We'll be in touch soon.

Sorry about that.

Lots of call this time of year.

Well, all right.

There she is.

All right.

Are we good?

What did we agree to?

250.

250 sounds about
right for this piece.

250 bucks.

What's all this?

Some kind of joke?

It's $250.

And this is a counterfeit.

No, no, no.

That is Abner Outlaw's buckle.

We agreed to $250,000.

Because this, this is
Abner Outlaw's belt buckle.

Okay, well, look here.

Each Cow Palace original
dated prior to 1945

is engraved with the year and
the finish number on the back.

This buckle has
neither of those.

I'm sorry.

It's nothing more
than a counterfeit.

This is, this is
Outlaw's buckle.

It's a fake.

No, it's not.

I'm sorry.

You can go and try and
find another buyer.

But I've been doing
this for 25 years,

and what I just handed
you is more valuable

than what I'm taking
in right here.

I'm sorry.

This is his buckle.

Fuck!

Jesus Christ, Abner.

You scared the shit out of me.

I didn't expect you
to be here this fast.

If Sheriff comes
looking, you call me.

Rollins!

Rollins?

Rollins!

How are you doing
in there, Jelly?

Shit.

Rollins?

Shit.

Shit!

Shit.
