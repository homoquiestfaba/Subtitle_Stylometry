Where are you?

You sound far away.

Yeah...

well.

What's wrong?

Listen...

I'm...

<i>What is it?</i>

I'm taking off baby.

<i>I can't do no more.</i>

Can't do what?

<i>What?</i>

I guess I'm sayin' goodbye,
that's what I'm doin'.

Goodbye?

What you're sayin',
you don't love me anymore?

<i>I can't...</i>

I mean I gotta go.

You're joking me aren't you baby?

<i>No, I ain't sugar.</i>

Ain't nothin' wrong with you.

It's just...

us I can't handle.

<i>I'm sayin' goodbye.</i>

Don't say that...

please don't go.

I can't do no more.

I gotta go.

<i>Please...</i>

Please..

<i>"Up In Flames"</i>

I fell for you baby...

like a bomb

Now my love's gone...

up in flames

We're history baby

Read it in a book

It ended in the fire

That started with the look

I fell for you baby...

like a bomb

Now my love's gone...

up in flames

My head's full of smoke

Heart's full of pain

That tender love is gone

Gone up in flames

You should've shot me, baby

My life is done

You could've shot me, baby

Shot me with a gun

I hear those sirens...

scream my name

I know my love's gone

Up in flames.

<i>"I Float Alone"</i>

Floating through this darkness

All alone

Love is gone in darkness

Cold as a stone

Searching through the shadows you have known

Love's gone

Bare as a bone.

Trying to hold the memory face

You seem to have vanished without a trace

And in this darkness

This empty space

I float alone.

Now the night is falling

You have gone

Sad dreams blow through dark trees

Love's gone wrong

Clouds of sadness raining all night long

Love's gone 

The end of our song.

I float alone.

<i>"The Black Sea"</i>

<i>"Into the Night"</i>

Now it's dark

Into the night

I cry out

I cry out...

your name

Into the night

I search out

I search out your love.

Night so dark

Where are you?

Come back in my heart

So dark

So dark.

Into the night

Shadows fall

Shadows fall so blue.

I cry out

I cry out for you.

Night so dark

Where are you?

Come back in my heart

<i>"I'm Hurt Bad"</i>

<i>"Pinky's Bubble Egg"</i>

In the far away world of Pinky's Bubble Egg,..

things changed

I know one thing

I wasn't alone

I could hear you

I wasn't alone

I could hear you coming closer

Pinky's Bubble Egg

Repeats in the dead hunger

Darkness my heart was stuffed in a trunk

Beating like hell

Saturn fell rolling

The Twins Spoke

<i>"The Dream Conversation"</i>

I like to tell you all about a sad dream.

It's the Dream of the Broken Hearted.

Where are you?

You sound far away.

Yeah... well.

What's wrong?

Listen... I...

What is it?

I'm taking off baby.

I can't do no more.

Can't do what?

What?

I guess I'm sayin' goodbye,
that's what I'm doin'.

Goodbye?

What's that mean,
you don't love me anymore?

I can't... I mean... I gotta go.

You're joking with me,
ain't you baby?

No, I ain't sugar.

I ain't nothin' wrong with you...

It's just... us... I can't handle.

I'm sayin' goodbye.

Don't say that...

Please don't... go.

I can't do no more.

I gotta go.

Please... Please..

Do you remember
our picnic lunch?

We both went up
to the lake

And then we walked
among the pines

The birds sand out
a song for us

We had a fire
when we came back

And your smile
was beautiful

You touched my cheek
and you kissed me

At night we went
for a stroll

The wind blew out hair

The fire made us warm

The wind blew the waves

Out on the lake

We heard the owl
in a nearby tree

I thought our love would last...

forever.

<i>"The Final Battle"</i>

<i>"The World Spins"</i>

Moving near the edge of night

Dust is dancing in the space

A dog and bird are far away

The sun comes up and down each day

Light and shadows change the walls

Halley's comet is come and gone

The things I touch are made of stone

Falling through this night alone

Love don't go away

Come back this way

Come back and stay
Forever...

and ever

Please stay

Dust is dancing in the space

A dog and bird are far away

The sun comes up and down each day

The river flows out to the sea

Love don't go away

Come back this way

Come back and stay
Forever...

and ever

The world spins
