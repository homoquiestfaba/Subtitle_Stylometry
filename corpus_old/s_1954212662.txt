I know you.

But you're not here to see me.

Someone will hear us. They must.

I mean, no one wants me to die.

Someone will hear us.

Is someone there?

Please. I have a wife.

A wife or a secretary?

Don't make me.

Don't make me...
I wasn't going to shoot you.

But now I have to.

Why?

You tried to kill me.

No, I didn't.

And you'll try again if I let you go.

No, I won't. I promise.
I don't believe you.

A man's word...

I don't want to die.

It's part of a process.

I can pay you.

It's not me you should have paid.

Anyway, you talk too much to shoot me.

After killing, I used to have to wait
an hour or so before I could eat.

Cuter than when you were ten.

I suppose that's progress.

You grew up different than I thought.

But so did I.

You don't have to say anything.

Michelle, how much of the
forest do you remember?

I remember it was autumn.

Never give this back to me.

How's the English coming?

I have a new teacher.

I would practice with you,
but it gives me a headache.

You can still practice with me.

And how do you say "eye"?

Drink?

Same as last time.

What's this?

Superstructural fittings, a fuse,
an initiating charge...

a main charge of high explosives
and a bomb case.

We wanted it assembled.

So assemble it.

The other half of my payment?

Now?

You have something better to do?

Present perfect tense expresses
action which began in the past...

but continues in the present.

Past perfect tense expresses action
which began in the past...

and was completed in the past.

Come on.

Future perfect tense expresses action
which will begin in the future,

and be completed by a specific
time in the future.

You must be kidding!

Don't be rude.

Behave.

Help!

We won't say anything about this.

She just left.

Always making a racket.

It's a talent.

Depends on your line of work.
Wait.

In horseracing today,
the results from Vincennes:

The third race was won easily
by number 16, Avril Doré.

Got any money I can borrow?

That's too much.

That's okay, take it.

I'll pay you back.

You working?

You looking?

Really?

I saw Michelle Tillier again.

You want to get a drink?

No, I'm going to see her.

Why don't you come?

Me?
Yeah.

Jean-Pierre!

Best just to let him go.

Like you know what's best.

It's been a long time.

Got any money I can borrow?

That's too much.

You're right.

I'll pay you back.

I won't hold my breath.

You're mixed up in something.

And you're not?

Not like you.

You trying to make me feel better?

Sorry.

Is this business?

All business. Nothing personal.

Do I know you?

Who do you work for?

How can you live like this?

It doesn't help with you dropping
your garbage about.

You're an incredibly stupid man.

Do you know who I am?

The English teacher.

I don't have many students anymore.

Michelle.

Oh... that.

I knew it was something.

Thought you were here to kill me
or something...

in your big black coat and everything.

The thing is, that was something
that just happened.

I guess I wasn't thinking.

Just like I'm not thinking now.

I should warn you that I work for
a certain type of professional.

Sure.
I'm armed.

So am I.

Which leg?

The tibia is a big bone and will heal quickly...

but it will always hurt on cold days like today.

Let's go. This one here.

It is you who is stupid.

Scream as loud as she did.

No one will hurt you again.

Okay.

One, two, three...

four, five, six...

seven, eight, nine, ten!

Do you know why we're here?

All the hotels were full?

Why did you break his leg?
He wouldn't tell us.

Legs are important.

How many hits did it take?

Why didn't you finish him off?

There must be a weakness in you.

Then why don't you try letting me go?

Careful.

Seeing how you owe me
for the English teacher...

I'd like you to do something for me.

I'm not interested.

It's not breaking anyone's leg.

I want you to find something that's missing.

Missing or stolen?

Both.

What's inside?

None of your business.

You would have been dead.

You've got the wrong guy.

You can help me or not, but one
way or another you owe me.

I hate to be hit!

You can kill him, but I'll shoot you.

There's a weakness in me, remember?

Obviously temporary.

The fridge is full, make yourself at home.

Woman?

One cannot be blessed every night.

I can't go to my place anymore.
It has rats.

You need a good exterminator.

What did you think of Michelle?

I don't know.
A woman who gets beat up like that...

Everyone has to go through
whatever they have to go through.

Even you?

Especially me.

Me?

Yes, you, too.

Heard anything about a missing briefcase?

Why?

Everybody's been asking me.

You're a good person to ask.

A little bit too good.

It's a talent.

Depends on your line of work.

Thanks for the ride.

Tell him I'll pay him his money.

Relax, he knows you're my friend.

Smells good.

Indeed.

A little more thyme, please.

I don't tell you how to break heads,
so please don't tell me how to cook.

Somebody asked me about a briefcase.

A briefcase?

Is it yours?

Then you shouldn't concern yourself.

I was just curious.

That's not like you.

So you haven't heard anything?

Some customers were speaking
about a briefcase.

What did they say?

I don't know, it was busy.

The waiter couldn't eavesdrop
as much as he would have liked.

People speak at a dinner table.
You have to remember more.

All I have to do is cook.

You're right.
It doesn't need more thyme.

Of course.

They said something about a briefcase
being thrown in the trash.

Has the trash been picked up yet?

You're all dirty.

Was there anybody here in the last few days?

Every day I wake up frightened.

Just like you.

Did you find anything?

Somebody probably just made a mistake.

Just like you're making one now.

How did the job in the forest go?

He owed me money.

Why is he still alive?

Being in the forest again...

I know.

But I trusted you.

Put him out of his misery.
Do me a favor.

Of course you're angry.

But so am I.

Don't touch me, I'm dirty.

What happened?

I quit my day job.

Oh, shit.

"Oh, shit" is right.

Come.

Slowly.

Will you be joining me?
Of course.

I sometimes blame all my
violent tendencies on...

Violent tendencies?

Violent.

So the next generation trying to
muscle their way into the business.

That's right.

New, but not improved.

Some things don't need improving.

It's a game of character.

The rules are simple, but precise.

I have a choice. I can either get
myself closer, or knock you away.

This is the part that always
reveals people's nature.

Wasn't your ball a little further over?

I don't know. You think?

Should we measure?

Like me, you might have to learn
the game the hard way.

I don't know where she is.
She always came to my place.

Who would know?

It's not who would know.

It's who would tell you.

What am I supposed to do with this?

I'm sure it can't be too hard to assemble.

You need some crutches.

But I'm saving this for Jean-Pierre.

I'll sign his cast.

Did anyone follow you here?

Of course not.

SHIT

I can't say that I'm completely
sorry to see you.

You'll change your mind.

You want to go get a drink?

You think Noel would approve?

Don't get mixed up in his affairs.

That's why you're here.

I would be careful.

Why the concern?

I'm just trying to avoid
carrying out the next step.

She must like you.

It worked, you coming here.

I'm going to get serious.

I said "careful", not "serious".

I settle disagreements in a bad way.

Right now we are disagreeing.

14-to-1, three races...

How much do I owe?
A lot.

You think this is a good idea?

You sure?

Okay, but we split the winnings.

I mean it.

Just one more race.
I've got enough.

I promise, I've got enough!

I think they must have painted it blue
to look like the sky.

How do you feel?

I don't know, I haven't tried to move yet.

Then don't.

You want some?

No more apples.

What's all this?

What I see.

I want to remember everything I've seen.

I do everything I can to forget.

Well, not everything...

What do you want me to say?

If you can't talk to me, who can you talk to?

True.

Where did you get the case?

It's not all that simple.

Simon showed me how to
make some extra money.

He was good at those things.

Simon had found the briefcase.

It was an accident.

Who was Simon?

It's not important.

We shared cigarettes and drank together.

I didn't love him.

It never snows when you want it to.

Do you know what you've done?

We shouldn't open that.

You need to leave.

Now.

What?

Nothing.

Yeah, nothing.

Straight across is America.
We could always go there.

And leave France?

Absolutely.

We can split up and try to meet,
or go on together.

What do you want to do?

It's up to you.

Brittany has nice crepes.

Delicious.

Then I better come with you.

I don't know who set the bomb.

It's just as important to know who didn't.

It wasn't me.

And you...

Why didn't you speak up when
Claude cheated at pétanque?

I didn't necessarily want you to win.

I'm thinking about leaving for a while.

Leaving?

Okay.

It's okay?

Yes.

When you were a kid, did you ever play
that game where you fall back?

What?

The game where you fall back and trust
the person behind you to catch you?

I don't like games.

They can teach you a lot.

I'll catch you. Close your eyes.

Just try it.

I can't.

Trust me.

When I fell, no one caught me.

I called a taxi earlier.

Why don't you take it?

No more games.

You look Ionely.

Just tired.

He didn't ask to see me?

That's a nice restaurant.

My girlfriend and I used to
go there for omelets.

When we were still going out.

That means I'm single.

THE TAXI DRIVER

You look tired.

Just Ionely.

Andre said to mention his name.

I'm warning you.
No drugs here.

We need a nice room with a big bed.

We don't like you either.

He just doesn't know us yet.

Our first hotel room.

Hopefully, our last hotel room.

Bastard.

That's okay, we weren't going to pay anyway.

Who gets the bed?

I'll arm-wrestle you for it.

Are you serious?

But you can't possibly win.

Hey, no cheating.

I don't need to cheat. Ready?

Do you want me to try for real?
For real.

I'll just outlast you.

Never.

Sometimes we're like kids.

Except we know more.

I haven't told you what's inside the briefcase.

I don't care what's inside.

What's inside?

A key.

What else?
That's it.

A key to what?

A locker.

What's in the locker?

Something important.

Either tell me or don't.

I don't know. It's important enough
to keep a key in a briefcase.

It's locked.

I can see that.
What's the combination?

I don't know.

Then how do you know what's inside?

Simon told me.

Why did you take it anyway?

I was curious.

You can't get away with things like that.

Sometimes I can.

So can you.

Don't you think someone will want it back?

Don't you think I know what I'm doing?

We're going to lose each other
because of that briefcase.

We're not going to lose each other.

Thank you.

I wish we had that drink.

The only rule is that you can't touch my ball.

You're not showing any respect.

I'm trying.

And I'm trying to see that you don't
end up dead in the gutter.

The gutter isn't so bad.

But being dead is.

Let's start with what you know.

Then we'll move on to how you can help me.

Trust me, I wouldn't be much help.

We'll forget about the money you owe.

Stop it.

I haven't done anything yet.

I'm innocent.

The first sign of guilt.

Careful.

I don't like to lose.

It's your turn.

You slept well.

You're up early.

Scouting our next hotel.

Looks Ionely.

It is.

I'm tired of this photo crap.
You should've told me earlier.

Where's the briefcase?

It's you that wanted to put him
out of his misery.

Strange that you pay your respects.

It's the least I can do.
It's because of me that he is here.

It's because of both of us.

The guilt will fade.

Or become a part of me.

Here. Maybe you'll be the one
putting them on my grave?

And maybe it won't be too long.

You're not old.

You don't have to be old to die.

But it helps.

You're so young.

You can always tell by the hands.

Somebody cut me when I was young.

It made me old.

How did the job in the taxi go?

He got away.

On his own, or did you let him?

Claude.

I let him.

Do me a favor.

Favors are serious.

Yes, favors are serious.

Don't cut me!

What kind of man do you think I am?

Old.

You'll take responsibility for your mistake?

Yes!

We're going to need some more flowers.

I've been waiting a long time.

It's difficult to wait.

Claude wants to see you.

Tell him to wait.

You're always so...

He's always so what?

Indifferent.

There doesn't seem to be anything
indifferent about your leg.

Terrible.

How long do you normally have
to wait before you can eat?

Eating isn't the problem.
It's the sleep.

It's everything.

I actually feel bad hitting a cripple.

Then don't think of him as a cripple.

Shoot her.
I'm just a messenger.

Shoot both of you.

Noel asked for you.

Doesn't mean she has to
walk out of here alive.

I would owe you a favor.

Favors are serious.

Deal.

With him, I won't sleep for a week.

That's the price for being... indifferent.

Maybe it doesn't look so bad...

You look terrible.

You think?

Do you know where Michelle is?

No.

Heard anything?

How well do you know Michelle?

What do you mean?

Never mind. I see you're in a bad mood.

Getting worse by the minute.

Can I stay at your place for a couple of days?

Sorry, but I have a new girlfriend.

Your girlfriend, is she nice?

What do you want me to do?

You look pale.

I am.

It's just a broken window.
Let's get back in the car.

Are we done?

Come on. It's cold out here.

But I trusted you...

If you move, I will shoot you,
and I don't want to.

I believe you.

Why did you do it?

The money.

The combo has been changed.

What is it?

I don't know.

I said, what's the combination?

You're repeating yourself.

So it starts...

Just answer his questions.

And what?
You'll just let me walk away?

We'll let Michelle live.

She's probably the only one
who knows the combination.

What's the combination?

Michelle doesn't tell me anything.

And you don't ask.

They're so dumb.

Yeah, aren't they?

One of you knows the combination.

Which one do I have to hurt
before the other tells me?

Now you're being rude.

Start with him.

Now how are you going to untie him?

He may not be a thinker,
but he's a great hitter.

He does it the right way.

Looks like someone just
did it to him the right way.

Let me know when you're ready to talk.

I hate to be hit.

Take off the gloves.

Six, one, nine.

What?

Six, one, nine.

Careful.

I mean, it's probably nothing...

but someone might have booby-trapped it
with explosives or something.

Someone like you?
Someone exactly like me.

You.

Open it.

You think I'm stupid?

Have him open it.

You've just made an incredibly huge mistake.

Wait.

Not until we check the key.

Here's the money I owe.

You said you would pay me back.
I'm just holding you to your word.

Thanks.

You should get help for your problem.

It's not a problem.

I see. But you've been avoiding me.

Wouldn't you?

Probably.

Maybe I can lend you a hand...

Lend a hand?

You know, whatever you need.

It's probably not a good idea.

I need to lend a hand.

Need can be great.

Exactly.

You sure?
Yes.

You'll wait here to see who shows up.

That's for the money?

The money is for what comes after.

Okay.

That just leaves one more thing.

Even though this is your choice,
you need something to remember.

No, I have a good memory.

Nothing is done to you that hasn't
already been done to me.

That doesn't make it right.

That just makes it what it is.

Where are you going?

I'll do anything you want.
Just like Veronique?

You lied to me.

I lied to myself.

Do you want to know everything I've done?

No, it wouldn't matter if you told me.

It's nice to see you again.

You, too.

We didn't lose each other.

Has Claude been gone a long time?

Don't worry about Claude.

There are five important parts
that make up a bomb.

Superstructural fittings:
Like fins, kopfrings, etc.

A fuse.

An initiating charge.

A main charge of high explosive.

And a container for holding the bomb.

There must be something else.

There would be something else,
if this was the right key.

Sometimes the tables turn...

the guilty becomes the victim of the injured.

Violence without conscience.

Where's Claude?

Noel wants to see you.

Don't go.

It'll be fine.

Has anything ever been fine?

He doesn't have a choice.

You don't have a choice.
He has a choice.

You've already taken the
choice away from me.

Stay in Metro Porte des Lilas until I come.

Relax, he likes you.

Don't be naive.

I heard there was an explosion.

It wasn't me.

I'm sure none of this has been you.

But sometimes you have to bury a bone...

to see which dog digs it up.

I don't care about the key or the briefcase.

That's the difference between
you and Michelle.

I told her that no one would hurt her again.

You shouldn't have told her that.
You limit your options.

What kind of options do I have now?

None.

Everything is wrong.

I'll scream.

I know.

Jean-Pierre is coming.

Leave Jean-Pierre out of this.

You're going to mess everything up.

It's not too late to do the right thing.

Now it's too late.

Andre, calm down.

He cut me.

He's dead now.

I don't believe you.

Have I ever done anything for
you to doubt my word?

No, but I've never been
on your bad side either.

You don't have to do this.

It's too late. You'll kill me.

I won't. You have no idea what it's like.

Unforgivable.

I forgive you.

Ever do something that you
really didn't want to do?

Makes you feel ugly.

And most of the time it's a mistake.

I make lots of mistakes.

Me, too.

I need an ambulance. My boyfriend
just swallowed some poison.

34 rue Dumoncel in the 14th. Sixth Floor.
His name is Andre Dupont.

I won't be here when they come.

Is there anyone you want
to speak to one last time?

What?

You don't have much time.

Why me?

Mistakes.

How could you?

For the money.

The money...

Plus I owed a favor.
