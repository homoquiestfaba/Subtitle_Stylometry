  [fluorescent lights buzzing]

              Hmm.

             Hmm.

            Hmmmmm.

          Let's leave.

        Oh, come on man.
        Let's keep thrifting.

          I'm finding
    some pretty good stuff.

All I found is this weird doll,
          Diver Diva.

    Oh, Diver Diva's great.

      She tells you facts
        about the ocean.

         But watch out.
    [singsong] She's sassy!

       [girl]<i> The Pacific</i>
     <i> is the biggest ocean.</i>

         <i> It's massive,</i>
  <i> kind of like your forehead!</i>

           <i> [giggles]</i>

   Oh, come on, man, Pickle,
  you can find anything here.

      You just gotta hunt
      for the good stuff.

          Okay, okay.
        Hmm, let's see.

      Scuba gear, boring.
  Oh, hey, is that a toaster?

    Oh, yeah, come to mama,
          sweet baby.

       Hey, what's this?

       - [gasps] Peanut!
       - What'd you find?

   It's the cassette version
       of Tinfoil 2000's

       -<i> Linens on Fire! </i>
        - Tinfoil 2000?!

   [electronic music playing]

            Pickle,
            you hit a gold mine!

This album is basically
our childhood.

It helped us navigate
those dark days

before everybody figured out
how cool we were.

   [electronic music playing]

      [Peanut]<i> Track three</i>
    <i> got me through</i> the talk.

   <i> â™ª Rage, rage, pump, pump,</i>
   <i> fist, fist, punch, punch â™ª</i>

   [Pickle]<i> Track six got me</i>
  <i> through my first heartbreak.</i>

      - [computer chimes]
  - "Let's hang out sometime."

           [bleeping]

           [whimpers]

    <i> That's when it was time</i>
<i>to turn those splashes of tears</i>

     <i> into buckets of rage!</i>

    - [humming out-of-tune]
          - [sobbing]

   The 12 songs on that album
    defined our whole life.

        [gasps] Peanut!

       This tape has a--
          [stammering]

          Bonus track!

          Bonus track?
     <i> That</i> wasn't on the CD.

      Pickle, it's like we found
      a brand-new

      - Tinfoil 2000 song!
   - [electronic music plays]

      - Oh, hey, Big Duke!
          - Big Duke!

     [whispers] Psst! Guys!
       I'm on the phone.

       [both whispering]
           Big Duke.

           Big Duke.

          - Big Duke.
          - Big Duke!

      Uh-huh, yeah, okay.

      You'll have to quit
        your squawking.

  I'll get back to you later,
         Mr. President.

        Hey, what's up, honkers?

       One tape, please.

    This is the greatest day
          of my life.

And, uh, two of these?

        Not a whole lot going on
        for you, huh?

            - Nope!
   - No, no, no, not really.

     Ready to meet your destiny?

      - What do you mean?
   - I'm gonna play the tape.

Pickle, the van doesn't have
a tape player.

                Watch and learn.

                      [grunting]

        - Don't say it.
That's okay, man, look, okay?

We just gotta think
about who do we know

who has the most banging
system in town.

That-- uh, that's
retrofitted for cassetteses.

   - [hip-hop music playing]
     - [grunting to music]

           Better, better, yeah.
           [grunts]

   Okay, McSweats, so can we
    listen to our song now?

                 As you can see,

       this is a top-of-the-line
       machine.

           How about you fellas
           just hold your horses

           and just watch ba--
           watch the bottom
           drop on this?

McSweats, we don't
have time for that!

                [grunts angrily]
                I don't care.

  Oh, great, thanks, McSweats.

                 I-i-ntercepted.

 Oh, come on, man, I just want
     use your tape player.

            First y'all gotta do
            something for me.

              Okay, are we live?
              Hey, America.

    My name's McSweats,
    and this is my audition tape

            for<i> Extreme</i>
            <i> Black Belt Warrior!</i>

       [stage whispers]
       Okay, give me a close-up.

          Apologies in advance
          for blowing your mind.

            <i> Ichi, ni, san, shi.</i>

           [screams]

          Oh, my gosh,
          we gotta do something!

This is terrible!
Quick, get the tape!

      - Get the tape out!
 - Stop! I can't! The buttons!

 - They're all jacked up, man!
 - We gotta take this
 to a professional!

      [warbling electronic
         music playing]

          Oh, yeah,
          this'll be no problem.

    - Thanks a lot, Lazer--
     - Oh, hey, thank you--

Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lazer!
We need you to<i> fix</i> this.

             What? I'm basically
             a scientist,

             and even I
             couldn't make this
             thing work again.

Come on, there's a track
on that tape we gotta hear!

     Ugh! Look, I can't make
     your cassette stop playing.

        The tape's gonna get
        shredded no matter what,

        but maybe if you replace
        the speaker,

           you can at least
           still hear the track.

           Check the bottom
           of the lake.

            We just
            dumped one of those
            stereos last week.

    You guys just dump stuff
          in the lake?

         That's, like,
      our drinking water.

 We're called the Gadget Dump!

         What the brown
   did you think we do here?!

   [warbling electronic music
           continues]

  [gasps] That's the baseline
          to track 10.

   We're running out of time.

       Man, how the heck
        are we gonna get

  - to the bottom of the lake?
        - You know what?

         Remember back
      at the thrift store?

  They had those two big boxes
         of scuba gear.

We can go back and get those.
Yeah, let's go, man!
Let's do it!

  - Hurry up! Hurry up,
    dude! Let's go!
  - Okay, geez.

     Hey, sorry again, man.

      There's only one box
         of scuba gear,

          and one box
   of five Cuban sandwiches.

     Yeah, hey, no problem.
 "A," I like Cuban sandwiches.

 "B," I think I found something
  that'll do the trick anyhow.

    <i> Magellan was the captain</i>
       <i> of the first ship</i>

  <i> to circumnavigate the globe.</i>

       <i> What have you done</i>
        <i> with</i> your<i> life?</i>

   [warbling electronic music
           continues]

            [gasps]

Peanut, the tape's on track 12!
We only have a few minutes left!

 Then let's find that speaker.
           [grunting]

  <i> Some scientists say lampreys</i>
   <i> have the greatest suction</i>

     <i> of all sea creatures,</i>
     <i> but I think it's you.</i>

    Ugh, smells like plastic
            in here.

        [muffled speech]

             What?

        "I can't hear."
          Oh, got it.

    These emojis are getting
         real specific.

            Okay, Peanut,
            we have five minutes

            to get down there
            and find that stereo

             or we'll never hear
             that bonus track.

I can't hear you!

 [electronic dance music plays]


           - [roars]
     - [muffled] Lampreys!

            [grunts]

           [gasping]

Peanut, are you okay?

               [muffled]
               Look, the stereo!

                        Huh? Oh!

The stereo!

Oh, no!

    â™ª Dootly doot doot doot,
        I love my job â™ª

      We gotta get that speaker!

             [grunts]
             I can't get a grip!

one of these guys! These guys!

      Oh, yeah,
      pretty good there, rookie,

             but check this out.

               Hey, look at me,
               I'm a tapir! Agh!


        [muffled]
        Oh, come on man, don't--

         [both scream]

Hey, why do we have
to dump the truck, too?

              Look, I don't make
              the rules, Kent!

          Let's get out of here!

   [warbling electronic music
            playing]

  We can still pull this off,
            Peanut!

            [grunts]

        [man]<i> Exclusive</i>
   <i> [stammering] bonus track.</i>

           We did it! We're only
           gonna hear it once,

            but at least we'll
            hear it together.

      [dance music plays]

                      Oh, right.
                      [grunts]

             This thing is stuck
             on your fat head.

           What are we gonna do?

I got it!

     You're right, you're right.
     We'll call it off.

       We can't hear
       the bonus track together,

   - I don't want
     to hear it at all!
   - [muffled shouting]

    Stop being a Diver Diva!

       I'm not listening
   to this song without you!

       - Peanut! Peanut!
     - Pickle, stop! Stop!

    Pickle! Pickle, no more,
       come on, stop it!

           - Peanut!
           - [gasps]

   Finally, some circulation.

           - [gasps]
        - [music stops]

            [moans]
     Oh, we were so close.

  <i> The octopus has nine brains.</i>

      <i> Looks like you don't</i>
         <i> even have one.</i>

    Pickle, no, whoa, whoa,
   Pickle, hold on a minute.

            Peanut,
   shut your voluptuous lips

       and let me mourn.

        Look, I recorded
  the whole thing on my phone.

    - Wha--?
    - Yeah, that's what
    I was trying to tell you

      when you were about
to throw the stereo in the lake.

   Oh, my beautiful baby boy!

You ready to finally meet
your destiny?

          Ready as I'll ever be.

  [Pickle and Peanut shouting
       over dance music]

Actually, it sort of has
a flow to it.

                   Like a remix.

I love it.
It's perfect, Pickle.

       I guess it all worked out
       in the end, huh?

It always does, buddy.
It always does.

     [hip-hop music plays]

Oh, hello,
and welcome to a special

behind-the-scenes look
at<i> Pickle and Peanut.</i>

      Let me just slip out
   of this old costume here.

        [sighs happily]

    Oh, yeah, it feels good
  to get out of that fat suit.

    Now, we're not just here
          to give you

      a little sneak peek
       behind the scenes.

         We're here for
    a special purpose today.

    Now as everybody knows,
   one of my biggest passions

      outside of the show
      is raising awareness

 for my boneless cats charity.

    It's a little-known fact
  that one in every four cats

        is actually born
         without bones.

  [Peanut] When Pickle told me
      about this problem,

 I knew we had to take action.

    Plus with our gargantuan
      celebrity cachet...

     We'll raise the money
          in no time.

    Because everybody knows
   that we have the best fans

      in the entire world.

        You guys are insatiable.

       Unquenchable. Bottomless.

So to raise money to change
the sweet little kitties' lives,

     - we're throwing a...
  - [both] Clip-show telethon!

And we got
our number-one man

running the deck,
ain't that right, McSweats?

         Yeah, I'll do
     whatever you guys want

 as long as you keep paying me
 in that sweet black licorice.

Oh, man, take it easy
on that stuff there, McSweats.

Now roll those titles.

           - [grunts]
     - [upbeat theme plays]

     You know, oftentimes,
   we often ask ourselves...

 What makes you guys so hungry
 for so much<i> Pickle and Peanut?</i>

      Our torrid platonic
          friendship?

That's right, remember the time
we took our friendship vows?

            I will never forget.

[blows kiss]

Thank you for being here,
Pickle.

    I trust our friendship,
 and I cherish our friendship.

  Thank you for that, Peanut.

    I trust our friendship,
 and I cherish our friendship,

     [both exclaim happily]

        Hey, look,
        donations are coming in.

Well, if you like that,
you know what else
they're gonna love?

                        No.

 Well, it's not just about us.

    How about all the people
      we met along the way

  that you fell in love with?

Roll the clip.

       <i> â™ª Champion horse â™ª</i>

     - [crowd] It's Philip!
     - [metal music plays]

I guess I'm always just gonna be
  the bully to you guys, huh?

    - That makes me so mad!
          - [screams]

         [man] Scampi!

    <i> â™ª Scampi, Scamp, Scamp,</i>

    - You're the best, Ryan!
          - [screams]

     - [man, flatly] Ryan.
      - [screams continue]

  Hey, looks like those clips
     did the trick, Flopsy.

   We're gonna reach our goal
          in no time.

           - [meows]
         - You said it.

Not only do we have a bunch
of crazy friends,

we also got to see
crazy places.

   - Like the sunbaked wilds
   of Australia.
   - [groans]

 - â™ª You can't make a cookie â™ª
 - â™ª You can't make a cookie â™ª

 - â™ª You can't make a cookie â™ª
â™ª Without the chocolate chip â™ª

Oh, that was kind of
a strange clip to play

from that
action-packed episode.

            Oh, no, no, sorry,
            wrong clip.

            Check this one out.

         [slow motion]
 â™ª You can't make a cookie... â™ª

     They're getting deep.

            [Peanut]
    Oh, yeah, that's exotic.

Oh, no!

    - No, wait, wait, wait!
  - Peanut, friendship tunnel!

   We're never gonna be able
to help these cats at this rate.

    I think we might just be
    on the wrong track, man.

    The stuff is just going
    right over their heads.

 - What are we gonna do?
 - We gotta go for
 the lowest common denominator.

    We're talking slack-jaw,
 mouth breather kind of stuff.

             Okay?
  We're talking action clips.

Hey, McSweats, why don't you
crank up the intensity?

I'm afraid not, boys,
this young man's

black-licorice levels
are off the charts.

One more sweet bite
and his blood

would've turned
into a delicious
black jelly.

Wait, hold on, hold on,
we're doing a fundraiser here.

He needs to stay here
and do the action clips.

       No, this man<i> needs</i>
     to go to the hospital.

    - Well, maybe we can get
    a second opinion?
    - Hmm?

           [shudders]
      You dark merchants.

All right,
now run those action clips!

   [muffled] You're the boss.

          [screaming]

       - Don't sting it!
       Don't sting it!
       - [screams]

          [explosion]

        [both screaming]

     - No, no, no, no, no!
          - [screams]

           - [roars]
       - Six-point buck!

          - [screams]
          - [coughing]

    [screaming and grunting]

      [Peanut] Okay, yeah,
       that's the spirit.

But what are we gonna do
to take this to the next level?

   What are you guys doing here?

   [both] Melissa Joan Hart?

        [singsong] That's right!

            I thought you guys
            weren't allowed

  - back on company property.
  - They said never come back.

        And technically,
         we never left.

         â™ª Loophole! â™ª
        [trills tongue]

Wait, that's it!

We need to use the power
of our celebrity guest stars.

Hey, MJH,
you were on our show once.

           Uh, I was
           on your show a bunch.

          - Uh, what?
    - Check out these clips.

   - [electronic beat plays]
      -<i> â™ª They call her â™ª</i>

   - [man] Melissa Joan Hart.
      -<i> â™ª They call her â™ª</i>

      - Melissa Joan Hart.
      -<i> â™ª They call her â™ª</i>

      - Melissa Joan Hart.
         -<i> â™ª Pi-pi-pi â™ª</i>

Hey, wait, where was I
in all those cli--

Never mind, never mind.

If that's what the fans want,
that's what the fans want.

      Yeah, and actually,
     you guys never paid me

    to be in those episodes.

       - [buzzer buzzes]
         - [both gasp]

Yeah, thanks, I'm gonna go blow
       this pocket change

   on some, uh, luxury SUVs.

            â™ª Bye â™ª

  [engine revs, tires squeal]

            - Ahh...
         - [horn honks]

Dang, that's a sweet ride.
Hey, don't give up, Peanut.

There were other guest stars.
      - Oh, that's right,

 Hey, what about Little Chugger
        the face train?

        Everybody loves
       a little chuggin'.

    [deep male voice]
    There's no problem
    when you've got friends.

           [screams]

          - [screams]
      - What's going on?!

Mm, uh, hey, guys.
Good news and bad news.

Good news is I'm feeling
a whole lot better.

Bad news is I puked
sticky black licorice

all over this AV equipment.

Ain't no more clips
coming out of this
bad mama jama.

           - Oh, no.
 - In other bad news, I guess,

           this doctor is
           riding the black rope
           to pleasure town.

         He may never come back.
         He may not want to.

      [somber music plays]

        - [sighs sadly]
          - Peanut...

Oh, sorry, cats.
Sorry, Pickle.

I guess my star doesn't shine
bright enough to help anybody.

       Oh, come on, Peanut.
       Here, have some licorice.

Get that outta here, man!

        I'm not getting
      on that junk again.

         This clip show
       was a stupid idea.

            Oh, hey,
     don't talk like that.

Your stupid ideas have gotten us
into a lot of stupid situations,

              but we always find
              a stupid way out.

Yeah, but how are we
supposed to have

a clip show
without the clips?

  Well, there's one other way

        we can show them
         our memories.

What are you talking about?

          I'm talking about
          a direct mainline

          right
          into our subconscious.

Wait, wait, hold on,
you can't mean--

      Yes, we let everyone

   into the friendship tunnel
            at once.

I don't know, Pickle,
that sounds so dangerous.

We're gonna be sore
for weeks.

     - [pan flute playing]
     - Our friendship
     is the only thing

       that's gonna save
      these Dumpster cats.

You know what?
You're right.

I trust our friendship,
and I cherish our friendship.

    I trust our friendship,
 and I cherish our friendship.

             [both]
       Friendship tunnel!

    [electronic music plays,
           no voices]

          Friendship!!

     [dub-step music plays]

         [music stops,
         both panting]

      - That was amazing!
 - Yeah! Let's check the chart!

  [buzzer buzzes, both groan]

      Guess it didn't work, huh?

I'm sorry, Flopsy.
Wet Tissue.

               Puddles. Bonesey.

    That's kind of ironic.
    We really let you down.

We tried so hard!

And I just--
I don't know what else--

      [Lazer] Will you two
   lady babies quit sobbing?

          [both] Huh?

            [Peanut]
 What are you guys doing here?

            We saw your pathetic
            failure on TV,

    and I want to help you out
    with your soggy-cat problem.

       [both stammering]

   Yeah, I'll help you guys.

Oh, runk-a-dunk,
I'll help you, too.

                 I'd do anything
                 for you boys!

        [all chattering]

    - Oh, thank you so much!
      This is amazing!
    - Thank you, everybody!

Oh, my gosh,
you guys really do love us.

Wow, we really are
the world's biggest stars.

Listen, every penny
of your generous donations

are going directly to
the enrichment and betterment

of these poor cats' lives.

      Yeah, starting with
      the bare-boned essentials.

      [upbeat music plays]

          [horn honks]

             [both]
  Boom-ba-boom-boom-boom-boom!

        Boom boom boom!

      Boom boom boom bo--

  Boom-ba-boom-boom-boom-boom
  boom-ba-boom-boom-boom-bo--
