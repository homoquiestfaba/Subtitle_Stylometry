<i>***One-piece swimsuit</i>

<i>On a beach in boston,</i>

<i>Instead of the cumbersome
dress and pantaloon combination</i>

<i>That was popular for women at the time.</i>

<i>She was arrested for indecency.</i>

<i>As someone who has always been known</i>

<i>To make daring fashion choices,I
see a lot of myself in her.</i>

So what ms. Kellerman designed was

the precursor To all modern swimsuits.

So not only would she be a
fascinating feature subject,

But we could do a whole
accompanying photo spread--

A hundred years of swimwear.

And...

I got the suit.

Unitards don't really scream sexy.

More like,um...

1970s magician.

That's the first smart thing you've said

Since half the staff had
to rescue you from a cult.

Snap!

I'm sorry. We'll be
keeping that a secret.

Betty,write the feature.
No photos,please.

And since we are on the
subject of the swimsuit spread,

Everyone knows we're
shooting in the bahamas.

That is essential employees only.

Matt hartley will be
drawing up the list.

So stop sending me tacky flowers,

And do your sucking up to him.

I am fine with tacky flowers.

Or,uh,better yet,cupcakes.

Basically,I can be bought.

That's all.

This will be my last shoot at "mode.

" I've told you many times before

That people will die at my
hands if things are not perfect.

And this time,I ain't playin'.

She ain't playin'!

Oh,that was fun.

Scaring the minions
for sport one last time.

It's not for sport,marc. I'm serious.

Oh,okay.

I thought you just Might want
to take it easy in the bahamas,

What,with the connor and nico fallout.

Fallout? My daughter betrayed
me,the love of my life died.

All things considered,a bad day.

Oh,I'm sorry,willie. If
you want to talk about it--

do I look like a girl?

Now is not the time to take things easy.

You're only as good as your last shoot.

the magazine business is shrinking.

And I am not cheap.

Ugh,one of the only "c"
words in the english language

Never used to describe you.

The other's "cuddly.

" Well,fortunately,the
editor-in-chief Of "isabella"

is stepping down Due to
life-threatening health issues.

And I have it on good authority

That the job is between
me and penelope graybridge.

Penelope graybridge?
Oh,I've heard of her.

She's beautiful and unstoppable.

and she's a junkie.

well,try to get her picture on

one of those "I lost
me to meth" billboards.

This job is my only option.

I didn't really mean it when
I told people to bribe me.

Didn't you,a little bit?

Well,maybe a little bit.

But with one spot left,I thought
I'd get some better stuff.

This is just stolen office supplies.

Hey,that's my stapler.

Not anymore.

I'll trade you.

Oh,my god. You,too?

It's not a bribe.

I mean,yes,I would love
to go to the bahamas.

But I'm not essential to the shoot.

This is just a thank-you gift

For helping me get
daniel out of the cult.

You're a good friend.

So we're really friends?

Yeah. I think we're friends. Don't you?

Yeah,definitely. Friends. Great.

I've gotta get back to
work. Thanks for the pail.

Yeah. Thanks for the stapler.

<i>bus driver... Move that bus!</i>

justin,you gotta come in here.

They just gave these
people their new house,

And there's,like,18 people
shaking uncontrollably.

Hey,bobby. What are you doing here?

I just came to get some water,you know?

Oh,no,no,not this show,hilda.

This makes me cry like
a baby. Turn it off.

You know,chicks kinda
dig it when you cry,right?

Hey,don't call girls
chicks. You hear me?

All right. I'm gonna go do my homework.

So why did you drive justin home?

Ah,high school can be rough,you know?

I just want to make sure
nobody bothers the kid.

Not on my watch.

see?

Try to act all tough guy,

But I've always known there's
a big softy under there.

Ooh. Bicep. It's not so soft.

All right. I got my water. I'm gonna go.

Okay.

Okay.

Come back if you get...

Thirsty again.

<i>you're a good friend. Betty</i>

I left something out of your gift.

It's all of your favorite colors.

Wait. Where's betty's stapler?

Okay,you can use that
bikini but not that model.

You know what? You came
in at the perfect time.

I'm just finishing my
list for the bahamas,

And I've got one spot left.

How'd you like
to go? - But--

You can be an associate
stylist for the shoot.

oh,my god. Oh,my god.
A promotion! Thank you.

okay,but... I have to ask
you,is this just a work thing?

'cause you're kinda big
on the mixed signals.

I know. I'm sorry.

Look,I have a great
time when we're together.

But sometimes it's hard
to think about you and me

When other people are around.

So it might be nice to get
together away from other people.

I totally agree.

we're talking about betty,right?

<i>Bahamas Personnel ****</i>

<i>Amanda Tanen Associate Stylist</i>

amanda? Amanda?! Amanda?

Amanda's going to the bahamas?

I wonder what she's gonna do there.

I guess she could not
answer the phones at atlantis

As well as she doesn't answer them here.

Did you not notice how
I hunched my shoulders

And averted my gaze
upward when you approached?

Learn how to recognize social cues.

Just getting coffee.

Co-worker coffee,Not "I want
to sleep with you" coffee.

Subtle.

Okay. That was weird.

is something going on between them?

Here's another social cue.

That means,"I'm not
going to talk to you.

" Marc,you know something.

And you might as well just tell me,

Or I'll just chase you out of the
elevator And through the streets.

okay,fine. But only because you have
sturdy legs And I'm in heels today.

I will tell you one
thing and one thing only.

Amanda has wanted to
tap matt for a while now.

and they went on a date recently.

And they're probably gonna
hook up in the bahamas.

Hey,look at that. I told you everything.

***** That he kept me off the list

Because he didn't want to feel
guilty about sleeping with her.

Yo. Language.

I've heard the word "sleep" before.

I thought you were over matt.

I am over matt.
She's not over him.

Well,you know,if I was you,

I would get myself to the bahamas,

Grab a fistful of that skank's
hair And take back my man.

I don't want to go to the bahamas.

That way,I don't have to have their
relationship Shoved in my face.

I wish me and archie
could go to the bahamas.

A little island
vacation--

That is exactly what we could use To...

Get the juices flowin'.

Okay,that I don't need to hear.

I can get you the "mode" rate
if you want. You'd love it.

They're putting everyone
up at the cove atlantis.

Oh,my god. You have to go.

Shakira's gonna be there this week.
I love her.

She goes under the name sidney lumpkin,

And I need you to get
this signed for me.

"my life with shakira.
yeah.

is that cute?

You got married!

My photoshopped life is so
much better than my real one.

So cute.

I'm not going to the bahamas.

Is it just my imagination
Or is everyone around me

pointing and whispering?

Oh,don't worry. They'll
stop once it grows back out.

I was talking about the cult,but thanks.

Now I know how you feel about my haircut.
Sorry.

I should probably just lay low
Until this whole thing blows over.

Oh,come on,daniel. Who cares?

You're about to go to the bahamas.

Given everything you've
just been through,

I think you should
do the exact opposite.

Get out there. Try and
be your old self again.

But wait. You used to be pretty
judgmental of my old self.

Wait. In fact,you're the one
who coined the term "man slut.

" oh,come on. People were calling
you "man slut" way before me.

And you know what?

Being a little man slutty
might be therapeutic.

I feel stupidly old-fashioned,

But I just can't do the
collars the way you do.

Thank you.

Now get me my beer,woman.

You are gonna more than
thank me in a second. - Wh--

I got a surprise for you.
Okay. Now?

I mean,I-I just showered,but,uh,yeah.

no,not that.

Here!

Atlantis? Paradise island?

Yes! Betty can get us a discount.

Justin is gone with
friends for the weekend.

So I figured it would be a good
way for us to, You know,reconnect.

Oh,hilda,I can't. I have a strategizing
meeting upstate this weekend.

And it might look bad
to voters,too,you know,

Taking a vacation in this economy?

It's not a vacation.

It's two days.

Oh,come on. You know
I would go if I could.

But at least now,you won't have to
deal with All my weird germ issues,

Like not being able to touch
a hotel bedspread,right?

right?

Yeah,okay.

Do what you need to do.

All right. I'll see you later,all right?

oh. Oh,hey,matt.

Which heels go better
with my bikini--

These or these?

I like those.

you're not gonna wear
that on the plane,Are you?

You're right. I'll freeze.

Do you have my messages?

That's great.

It's the same thing.

Be sure to pack the
portfolios in my carry-on.

I want us to work on the flight.

wouldn't want any downtime.

And do not pack your bathing suit.

I don't want any temptation to relax.

God forbid.

What is up with the muttering?

Why do you seem dissatisfied serving me?

it's not fair,willie. Everyone else is
gonna be there having fun except for us.

And what's the point? We don't
even have jobs to come back to.

Marc,I will get that
position at "isabella,"

And as usual,you will be my
assistant. Think positive.

I am. I am positive I need a vacation.

Oh,I meant to mutter that.

Congratulations,betty.

You're going on a trip.

And this time,you won't
be hidden in a wheel.

You're working for me in the bahamas.

Muttery,you just got a vacation.

Oh,um,actually,I-I
don't think I can--

Leave with tomorrow's group.

I can see myself in your glasses.

So,uh...

Yeah.

Hold on.

Excuse me.

Shh. Please don't say
anything,'cause nobody knows I'm here.

I got it.

I love you so much.

Thank you.

Shakira! I'm jealous. Love you. Bye.

{a6}<i>don't***</i>

I'm freezing to death,papi.

Please,if you loved
me,you'd let me be warm.

Oh,no,no,no,no! No,no.

Bobby?

Hey,this-- this was
on the floor of my car.

Justin must have left it,you know?

Whatever. Come in. I
can't talk right now.

The knob broke off.

I tried to turn it up 'cause
it's like alaska in here,

But of course it broke.

Look.
Look at this.

Look,let me take a look at it.

This is the worst weekend of my life.

I should be in the bahamas right now.

But,no,my boyfriend has
to,like,strategize or something.

And miss you in a bikini? That's...

That's a bad call.

All right. Come on. Paper towels?

All right,all right.
You know what to do?

You kidding me? I've
done this a million times.

All right. You just gotta
turn this little thing--

Damn!

Why'd you turn that up so high?

everybody,light it up,go,rihanna ?

Ooh,a bikini. How fresh.

We'll set the fashion
world on fire with this.

And this one doesn't
know what it wants to be.

It's the anne heche of swimwear.

Get rid of all of them.

I want new options.

Has one thing gone right today?

Ou found a wrangler for the models.

And they're terrified of her.

,The locals say she caught
a shark with her bare hands.

<i>breaking news! Fashion alert!</i>

Hover over the shoulder
of the phoapgrapr.

His confidens is bugging me.

<i>thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

<i>It is with humble
gratitude that I announce</i>

<i>My new position</i>

<i>As editor-in-chief of
"isabella" magazine.</i>

Penelope graybridge.

<i>And I couldn't have done any of it</i>

<i>Without my beautiful
daughter and my husband.</i>

<i>How could a girl get so lucky?</i>

Hi,amanda.
betty. What are you doing here?

Wilhelmina asked me to come.

You seem alarmed to see me.

No,I don't.

Really?

Are you sure? Because
I'm giving you the chance

To be upfront about whether or not

You might be dating a
certain guy That we both know.

We're talking about matt,right?

Yes.

Amanda. Amanda,come on.

Let's just talk about this.

this is the only empty stool.

I know we're not exactly
friends,So we don't have to talk.

Hi. Drink.

Is it so much to ask For a
little meaningless vacation sex?

But little
known fact--

There are no gay people in the bahamas.

I have scoured the gym,the
spa,the private beach.

Not a waxed chest Or a
condescending attitude to be found.

What about those two guys right there?

Totally gay.

European. Rookie mistake.

This is the worst gaycation ever.

Can I ask you a question?

Du you add the word
"gay" to any regular word

Just to kinda make it your own?

Gaybe. Gaybe not.

well,if it's any consolation,

I'm kinda trying to meet someone,too,

But apparently,I've forgotten how.

Well,this is your lucky gay.

okay. I'll stop that now.

but seriously,I can help y,u.

Girlselove it when a straighty
is down with the pink team.

Who-- who do you
have your eye on?

this girl over here.

Excuse me,pretty lady.

My straight friend here is
trying to set me up with guys.

How's that going?

Uh... Not so well.
I could use your help.

Okay. What about those two?

They're european.

<i>I'm g yo this gain't easy.</i>

I'll let you slide for that one.

I'm susannah.
Daniel.

Cheers.
Cheers.

amanda,I want to talk about this.
I don't.

Why didn't you just tell me
that you were dating matt?

Because I knew you
would get all vulnerable

And push your glasses up your nose

And make me feel bad that I like him.

Well,you should feel bad.

What if I still have feelings for him?

Well,what if I have
feelings for him,too?

Why do your feelings count
more than my feelings?

Because I was dating him first.

Isn't there,like,a girl code about that?

Not for pretty girls.

And you only got interested in him
again When I started liking him.

No,that is not true.

I've been trying to figure
out how I feel about matt,

But it's hard to do when someone
else Is already all up in his pants.

Said it.

I'll race you for him.

Um... But I'm--
I'm fully clothed.

So am I.

We're not children.

Then I guess I win.

Oh,god. Yes!

Whoo-hoo! In your face! I win!

Oh,come on,amanda. Don't be like that.

You'll find anothellmillionaire
to date in five minutes.

Is that really what you
think this is for me?

Betty,did it ever occur to you

That I might actually have
real feelings for matt?

No...

Because you're only
thinking about what you want.

And what is that? One
minute,you want to be his friend,

And the next minute,you want him back?

What about what matt wants?

He invited me.

betty?

Betty,what are you doing here?

Helping wilhelmina,Which I
should probably get back to.

But,uh... This is good.

I'm fine wit. It.

So all hell has broken loose,

And no one can find
wilhelmina to deal with it.

Which should worry me, Because
the only way wilhelmina slater

Would disappear from a shoot

Is at the hands of bin
laden or anna wintour.

But I'm on my first
vacation in five years--

okay,marc. I can deal with it.

I just hadhey heart crushed.

I t I can push that aside And
pretend like it never happened.

That'd be great.

* oh,baby *

* oh,baby * * keep on *

* my baby * * keep on doing it *

* right on * * oh,oh,oh *

* right on doing it *

* you got it together,keep on doing it *

* I'm never,never gonna give you up *

* I'm never,ever gonna stop *

* stop the way I feel about you *

* girl,I just can't live without you *

I hate to admit it,but
I rather enjoyed that.

You let me think you died.

You believed that? Oh,I'm so sorry.

I'm over it.

* I'll see you through it *

* I'm never,never gonna give you up *

* I'm never,ever gonna stop *

* stop the way I feel about you *

* girl,I just can't live without you *

* I'm never,ever gonna quit *

Still can't believe you're here.

And I still can't believe
you ate a cheeseburger.

Never repeat that to anyone or you die.

I'm so sorry I put you through all that.

I'm here with you now. So...

Let the mending begin.

So how soon can we get away?

The boat comes back for us tomorrow.

What'll we do in the meantime?

I was thinking we could
spend the afternoon

Having hot,secret sex.

Again?

Oh,my.

you are back and better than ever.

That never usually happens to me.

It's okay.

Uh,my wife died recently,so...

Yeah,you mentioned that.

Man,it's like africa hot in here.

Will you do something already?

Yeah,give me two more secs,please?

You said that a half-hour ago.

Man,I'm a bitch when I'm hot.

Yeah,you're kind of a bitch

When you're cold,too,you know?

That's part of my charm.

Do me a favor,all right?

Take your charm and go get me

A pair of needle-nose pliers,please.

I got you a pair of needle-nose pliers.

I also got you a hammer,a potato peeler

And four different
kinds of wrenches,so--

well,it's just that these things

Are a little confusing,okay?

They make it this way
so that you gotta call

One of their service
reps to come fix it.

you don't know what you're doing.

Yeah,I do.
Oh,my god.

You are a terrible radiator repairman

And a terrible liar.

So what are you even doing here?

I told you. Justin left a
"playbill" in my car,okay?

Justin would sooner leave me in a ditch

Than leave a "playbill" anywhere.

I came to see you.

Bobby...

I'm in a relationship.

Yeah,are you happy?

What kind of a question is that?

See,I've known you forever.

I know what your face looks like

When you're happy to be with someone.

I think about that face all the time.

Maybe I'm out of line,

but I'm not seeing that face These days.

Now you tell me I'm
wrong,I'll walk out the door.

You're wrong.

Okay.

Well,then,look,you should call somebody

That knows how to fix
this,all right? 'cause I don't.

Fine.

Wilhelmina. Hello.

Next time at least buy me a drink first.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh,wow.

I forgot that this was a topless pool.

Is this a topless pool?

Uh,anyway,uh,uh,some
updates--

The model wrangler passed
out in the dolphin key.

Apparently her method of
keeping the girls sober

Was to down their drinks herself.

Also the new swimwear is
here for your approval.

C-can I get you a robe or something?

Betty,betty,betty.

Oh,take the stick out.

Everythiil will be taken care of.

Um... How?

Tonight you can watch
the models at cain.

And tomorrow w wll wing
it with the swimwear.

"wing it"?
Oh,it's island time,betty.

Jump on board,man.

Now scat.

Here you go.

This is amazing.

When did you do all this?

Oh,I,um,set it up before we left.

Well,I am on board...

And on the pill.

That was a joke.

to...

Our first real date.

Bring it.

You okay?

No.

Look at me. I'm hot.

I'm actually having a really hard time

Not ripping my own
clothes off,But you're...

Not kissing me Like someone
who feels the same way.

Amanda,I would love to
rip your clothes off.

Oh,thank you.

But I have to ask you a question.

Do you still have feelings for betty?

'cause I don't want to get
in the middle of something

That's unresolved.

Betty has made it perfectly clear,

She just sees me as a friend.

You didn't answer my question.

Okay,betty's not in
the bahamas for work.

She's in the bahamas for you.

No. No,she's not.

She still has feelings for you.

And if you still have feelings for her,

Then now would be a really
good time to tell her.

how did things go with susannah?

Uh,great. I mean,wow.

Not to talk out of school,

But we did things I've
never even seen in movies.

Easy there,tiger. Anytime a
guy overcompensates that much,

It usually means the other
person wasn't into it.

Oh,no. She was... She was into it.

Oh. Oh. You couldn't
get the rooster to crow.

oh,marc. That never happens to me.

I-I can get turned
on anywhere--

elevators,atms,pharmacy...

Got it. -
Golf courses--

okay
Even once at a bris.

I mean...
Well,look,maybe the problem is,

You're trying to be who you were before.

And you've changed since molly.

When that happens,you know,it's...

Hard to go back.

You're really smart.

No,wilhelmina is really lucky
to have you working with her.

Thank you.

Would you please tell her that sometime?

oh,noi'not sure.

I think that guy over there
might be playing for your team.

oh,my god. You're
totally right. Good job.

So if you'll excuse me...

Refill. I've seen my future,

And it's needlepoint and
double-a batteries in bulk.

Okay,console her because
matt doesn't love her.

And you console him because
his weiner's not working.

bye.

Oh,my god,daniel.

Wait,daniel. What happened?

When we were dating,you
could get turned on anywhere.

Remember the shapiros' bris?

I know. That's what I was saying.

I...

Look,I'm sorry about matt. I
know you really cared about him.

yeah. pretty stupid.

No,any guy who doesn't see
how great you are is an idiot.

You didn't see it.

Yeah,but we all know... I'm an idiot.

Very true.

Hey,girls. How we doing?

Having fun? Yeah.

High five. No five? Okay.

Gula,no drinkin'.

Sorry,girls. Wilhelmina's rules.

But I know you guys are
hungry,so maybe I'll...

sneak you some shrimp later,okay?

come on,let's dance. Let's dance.

It'll be fun,right?

Like the party girls. Yeah.

Look at us.

See? This is fun.

Just a bunch of
attractive,single ladies...

Dancing,not drinking.

Hey,ladies.

Oh,yeah,actually,I'm with them.

Um,I'm their chaperone!

Hey,babe.

Sorry....

Matt...

Wait. What about amanda?

She's the one who sent me.

Okay,okay. You made your point.

I can't believe I met a
gay guy in the bahamas.

Where are you from anyway?

Oh,you're funny.

You know I do lighting for "mode.

" I can't believe I'm coming back

from the bahamas With a boyfriend.

Hey,you know,I'm really glad
you came after me last night.

I'm glad you were Just sitting
in your car waiting for me.

Don't you know by now?

I'll always wait for you....

I took the liberty of ordering breakfast

Before you head off to the shoot.

Oh,I like
my new life--

Waking up with you,eating food.

As soon as the shoot gets going,

You slip away,meet me in the cabana,

And then robert will get us to the boat.

That's room service.

So...

That happened.

ah Kinda crazy.
Yeah.

But... Good,right?
Yeah.

Oh,I'll get it.

That's weird.
Hello.

the models are gone.

What do you mean,"gone"?
I mean no one can find them,

And no one can find willie either,

And everyone's coming to me because
they assume That I'm her assistant.

I'm sorry. I know
that's driving you crazy.

No,it's
okay. I--

oh,hi,matt.

I tried to have an anonymous
fling in the bahamas,

And I ended up with someone from "mode.

" Troy? He's always liked you.

That was gula. The models are fine,

But some of them got on
a boat with some guys,

And now they're in cuba.

What?
Gula--

she's our cover model.
The photo shoot starts.

Well,I've got nowhere to be.

so I will be here to
help you solve this.

I might have just solved it.

Oh,come on.

So for the cover,

We would be shooting you
in a bikini on cove beach,

But this isn't just any cover.

This is our fearless issue.

I don't know.

Every magazine has a
bikini shot on the cover.

I mean... That doesn't
sound very fearless to me.

Well,you're right,yeah.

Here's another way we could go.
Really?

I'm telling you,I wear less
than this on a ski slope.

Wow. You look amazing. Hips don't lie.

Don't do that.
Sorry.

Okay,let's go.

* on three *

* you can have it all *

* anything you want,you
can make it yours *

* anything you want in the world *

* anything you want in the world *

* give it up to me *

are you happy?
I'm happy.

Oh,good.
Everything's good?

If you're happy,I'm happy.
That's good.

Now tell me if you need anything.

Okay. Oh,excuse me just one second.
Okay.

Hi,wilhelmina.

Um,so I had to make a couple of changes,

But I assure you,there
were good reasons.

It's not terrible.

Really? Thank you.

So if you'll excuse me...

You're lookin' good,shakira.

Dps don't lie.

Oh,no. She doesn't like

Who pitched that?
I have do idea.

Everyone,stay seated.

Move in! This is the fbi.

Come out of the cabana
with your hands up.

It's too late. Someone tipped off
the fbi. They swarmed the boat.

Well,then strap on a scuba
tank. We'll swim away.

You have to say it was you
that turned me in. - But--

Use it to get back to "mode.

I guess we actually did this right.

"mode" magazine. How can I help you?

The bahamas proofs just came in,

And not that you care about
other people's opinions,

But the entire staff is buzzing
about how great they are.

Oh,champagne.

I thought that you'd be more...

Heartbroken?

That is reason enough for me.

And since everyone
thinks I got him arrested,

Well...

There's something I need to tell you.

As his assistant.

Thing is,I don't want to.

I know it's not a job
as an editor,but...

Somehow I think...

Daniel will actually try
to make it happen for me.

Um,turkey sandwiches,

But I thought it would
be nice For us to stay in.

The "we slept
together,let's talk" lunch.

I'm just scared,matt.

We've been through... A lot.

And... What if it doesn't work out?

I really don't want to hurt you again.

I don't want to hurt you either.

Look...

There's no way to know
what's gonna happen.

But I do know I want to find out.

Yeah. Me,too.

Good.

Maybe that's all we
need to know right now.

Oh,yeah. I was gonna
call you about them.
