Come on!
This is heavy!

Come on.
We have no time now.

Everything must be set right...

or the master will be unhappy.

Let's go. Come on.

Madam, since I've been
serving you for 24 years...

may I ask you,
why must you do this?

Please.

At least not on your birthday.

I'm 40 years old.

It is time to do something.

Otherwise,
I'll feel sorry for myself.

You're not gonna tell me something's
wrong with the banquet, are you?

This is so tight,
I could hardly breathe.

Madam, everything's fine
with the banquet.

Good.

I had a strange dream last night.

I dreamed that my lord
had taken a second wife.

He was so happy.
You know how it is.

A man is happier
the more wives he has.

Are you suggesting
that I should consider...

May not be such a bad idea.

I will do it then.
Madam!

Madam Kang is dying!
Her blood is everywhere!

Come quick!

Mother, may I?

Go, go, go.

Don't disturb me.
I'm busy.

Madam Kang is dying.
Her baby refuses to be born.

No, you will not go.

Ailian, it is your
40th birthday party.

Lord, madam is worried
that it might damage...

our young lord's marriage
to the Kangs' daughter...

if she does not
go over to help.

It will be a while
before the guests arrive.

I will personally make sure
that she is not late for the banquet.

Be late...

and you will no longer
belong to the Wu family!

Hey! Come back here!
Stop right now!

Communist, come back!

Be careful, madam.

I'm sorry.

Sorry. No men are allowed.
Someone is in labour right now.

Thank God you've come, madam.

Meichen.

It's Ailian.

Can you hear me?

Sorry, Ailian.

Forgive me for not telling you.

Too embarrassed.

It's all right.

It's good fortune
to have a baby, even after 40.

No, please!

You can't go in!
Don't let him come in!

He can't go in there.

Father, I beg you.
Mother's dying.

The foreign doctor has come.

Where's the hot water?

Mr Kang, I've studied medicine.
I can help.

Leave me alone.

Doesn't he know that it's forbidden
for men to see such things?

What if I can save her life?

Madam Kang will lose all face.

She would rather die than have
any man but her husband see her there.

What good is face if she dies?

Pray for her.

I must talk to you before I die.

Please, take care of Lin Yi for me.

Is she still conscious?
Yes.

Andre, no!

I'm sorry.

Get out! Get out!

Get me a pan of hot water
and some fresh towels.

Now!

Has your mother returned yet?

Where is she?

Lord.

Old Lady was wondering
why we couldn't start yet.

She's losing patience.

You tell her we're almost ready.

What are we going to do?

Women. Never trust a woman!

I heard you shouted at Madam Wu.
Did I?

You know their family.
They own half this town.

You know that I needed her help,
and she did help.

I've worked too hard here
to let you make trouble for me.

Father! Father!

My master wants
to give this to you.

I appreciate your master's kindness,
but I cannot accept this.

Please give it back to him.

How dare you
make all of us wait for you!

Madam Kang will live...

and there is a foreign man,
a priest.

Go apologize
to my mother and guests.

We talk after dinner.

Let her be, my son.
Come sit by me, my daughter-in-law.

Let us begin.

Enjoy your meal.

If I were him, I'd spend money
on a concubine, not a banquet.

The Japanese have virtually
taken over Manchuria.

Maybe they will be satisfied,
then leave us in peace.

They will never
make it that far south.

Fengmo, here comes
your future bride.

Welcome, Mr Kang.
Please, follow me.

I can't wait
for your wedding banquet.

Daughter-in-law, what kind of a girl
are you going to find for my son?

I haven't thought about that yet.

Tell me, why do you want
another woman for your husband?

I think it is time
for me to retire from my duties.

What do you mean?

I somehow felt...

my husband deserves
a younger wife.

She's crazy.

My mother tried to kill herself
when my second mother came.

And my second mother took poison
when my third mother came.

She arranged it all for him.

I can't believe it.
Congratulations!

Thank you.

You have such a wonderful wife
to arrange a concubine for you.

That's really something.
Let's toast your first concubine.

What?

What are you talking about?
Stop pretending to be shy.

We just heard your wife say...

you deserve a younger girl.

But...
Second wife.

You must invite me
to the wedding banquet.

Come on! <i>Gan bei.</i>

Let me get some more wine.
Just call a servant.

No. It's my pleasure.

They said you are
giving me a concubine.

Why didn't you tell me?

Don't you like the idea?

Is there anything else, madam?

No. You can leave now.

Good night.

Ying?

You can call me in the night
if you need anything else.

Will you be jealous of her?

I'm 40 years old today.
I'm no longer young.

I like your hair's fragrance.

You had too much to drink today.

Who is she?

And how old is she?

Is she pretty? Look.

I want someone just like you.

It will be all right.
Trust me.

She will serve you better than I.

Will you still take care of me...

when the new one comes?

Since that day I marry you...

twenty-four years ago...

it has been my duty to serve you
and make you happy.

I thought...

I would hold you like this
until I died.

Father of my sons?

Father of my sons?

Let's talk about it tomorrow.

I think it might be better
to put you into younger hands.

Tomorrow. Do it.

I want to go to sleep.

Can we talk just a minute?

No.

Do it now.

Please.

Do it!

Aren't you coming to bed?

No.

I have a bed ready.

Hurry up. Hurry up!

Hey, you, stop!

Time to eat.
My God!

It's very funny.
What time is it tonight?

10:00.

My father is going to kill me
if he finds out I'm doing it again.

Then don't get caught.

Wait.

Who are you?
What are you doing here?

The matchmaker brought me here.
Matchmaker?

Oh, no! One is broken.

Thank heaven you're here!

I was terrified!

Stupid, stupid girl.

I told you to follow me.
Why don't you listen?

This girl is so perfect
for your family.

Her mother left her,
and her foster mother raised her...

in order to get a dowry.

If not for the war,
she wouldn't give her up so quickly.

If you could be so kind...

to add another, say,
50 pieces...

Fine. I need to speak
with her alone.

Of course, madam.
I'll leave her to you.

Go. Go!

What is that in your hands?
I told them to bring nothing.

I brought you some fresh eggs,
15 of them.

Not one is older than seven days.

Come closer.
I would like to see them.

But one got broken on the way.

Her feet are so big,
like a monkey's.

She's a country girl.

Must have gone barefoot
since birth. I think...

I hope you like them.

I had nothing else.

Do you think
you would like to stay here?

The matchmaker
told my foster mother...

that I will not starve here.

She told me to please you
above all else.

That necklace is very beautiful.

It's the only thing I have
from my real mother.

What is your name?

I have no real name.

My foster mother called me
Little Orphan when I was small...

and Big Orphan when I got big.

I can give you a name
if you wish.

Chiuming.

It means "bright autumn."

You will bring the brightness
to my lord's autumn.

Yes. I like it.
Don't you?

Mother, do you think a young girl
would suit a family like ours?

It's very generous of your wife
to arrange it for you.

More grandchildren will make
the Wu family even greater.

There is a law
forbidding concubines now.

These matters are not for children.
Grandmother.

I'm not a child.
I'm 18 years old.

The Kang family
has requested that...

Fengmo will receive
some foreign education...

before he marries the daughter.

Ask the priest from the orphanage
that you met at the Kangs'.

He can teach Fengmo.

I do not want to be married!
Fengmo.

The priest can come in,
but not his god.

Madam Wu has requested
that I come for an interview.

He's here. The foreigner.

The same man you met
at Madam Kang's.

And he said
you sent for him.

Send him in.

Don't stand there
with your mouth open like a fish.

It's a pleasure to see you again, lady.
Please forgive my rudeness.

Please sit down.

I should thank you
for saving my best friend's life.

We did it together, didn't we?

How would you prefer
I address you?

I forgot to ask
your name last time.

May I borrow your brush?

You can call me Andre.

You can write in Chinese?

Yes.

How long have you been here?
Three years.

Have some tea.

What country are you from?

I was born in America,
but China is my home now.

What made you come to China?

My church asked
for volunteers, and...

well, here I am.

I have heard
you have an orphanage.

Why would a foreign man like you...

like orphanage work?

It's a job for women.

Why should such a pleasurable and
important job be done by women only?

Do you miss your family?

I don't have a family.

Your parents didn't
arrange a wife for you?

No. I'm not married.

Is it because of your religion?

Yes. I'm a priest.

Sister Shirley tells me you're looking
for a tutor for your youngest son.

Yes. How much are your fees?

I don't require any fees.

Thank you for your kindness, but...

it would put the Wu family
in a lower position...

if you didn't accept the fees,
wouldn't it?

No, not at all.

We all have the same position
in the eyes of God.

Then we should give
the money to your god.

I'd rather not take money, but...

I will accept
some clothing and food...

for the children
of the orphanage.

That can be arranged.

Thank you, madam.

Classes will begin
the week after the wedding.

I hope you understand,
our Old Lady...

does not want you to talk
about your religion in your class.

Grandma!

Is he your grandson?
Yes.

I have three sons
and two grandchildren.

I'm sorry. Ying?

Where's Ying?
It's all right.

I like kids.

Come, come.

Come here.
I don't bite.

What is this?
A lion? A dog?

Get out of the way!

Young Lord,
this is your teacher.

It's a pleasure to meet you.
Congratulations on your wedding.

It's my father's wedding.

I'm sorry.

Madam Wu
invited me to this wedding.

I would never think...
Congratulations, Mr Wu.

You see, in America,
men have only one wife.

You're not in America now.

Forgive me.

What do you think
about getting a second mother?

I think it's disgusting.

My father has young wives.

But I'm the daughter
of the first wife.

Great.

Foolish thing!

What is there to fear?

Just lie back...

and it be over soon!

Consider how lucky you are.

Do you have a home to run to?

Or a mother to give you rice?

Just obey your duty...

and you can grow fat
and comfortable...

like me!

Your hands...

are like a washboard!

Please forgive me, lord.

You are hurting me!

What's wrong with you?

Stupid girl.

Take off your clothes.

Come...

over...

here.

Lord, I beg you, please don't!

Open your mouth.

Lord, please, I beg you!

Good morning, lady.
From now on...

you must call me Elder Sister,
not lady.

Yes, lad...

Elder Sister.

You are a member
of the Wu family now.

Sweeping the floor
is the servants' job...

not yours, child.

Yes, Elder Sister.

I hope you understand...

I put the entire happiness
of our lord in your hands.

Fengmo, what do you want?

I've just come to see you, Mother.
How are you feeling?

I'm quite well. Why don't you say
good morning to your second mother?

Good morning, Second Mother.

You should know the family rules.

Send a servant to let me know
before you come.

She's so young,
and Father is so old.

Send her home.

This is not something
for you to decide.

Mother, this is wrong.

Andre says that
even in Western countries...

everyone is supposed to have
a monogamous relationship.

Well, how does a foreigner
know about Chinese?

Fengmo, police! Move!

Let's go!

Stop!

It was my father-in-law's library.

My husband had it closed
after he died.

I've read most of the books here.

<i>Dream of the Red Chamber.</i>

You don't know
how many times I've read this.

Do you think a woman is capable
of learning as much as a man...

or is her mind inferior?

Inferior?

No, but they certainly
are different.

Do you think a woman is happier...

if she reads less?

I don't know.

But I do know that a book doesn't know
whether a man or woman is reading it.

If this is satisfactory,
I'll have them clean it for you.

It's perfect.

Madam?

Young Lord is in jail.

Why?

They said he is involved
with Communist activity.

Nonsense! I have to go get him.

Madam, you are a woman.
You can't.

But how can I tell the lord?

We're expected at
Madam Chiang Kai-shek's reception...

for the American ambassador
to Nanking.

Here's the invitation.

He is suspected
of being a Communist.

Without an order from
the Shanghai police bureau...

I can't release him.

Are you suggesting that I tell
Madam Chiang...

that you would prefer
to keep her guest in jail?

May I have your name, please?

Is that really a letter
from Madam Chiang?

Yes, it is, thanking me
for opening up the orphanage.

How did you know
he couldn't read English?

I took a chance.

The lamp is the sun.

The Earth.

The moon.

So, the Earth moves...

Around the sun.

And the moon moves
around the sun. Yes or no?

Yes and no.

Excellent.

My grandmother is the sun.

My father is the Earth.

My mother is the moon.

And I cannot escape their gravity.

Interesting.

My parents don't care
if the Japanese are right next door.

And our government is more interested
in making money from the war...

than in fighting them.

So what are you saying?

This concubine thing
makes me sick.

She's just a girl my age.

This place stinks
like a mouldy tomb.

They want me to be like them.

I must get out of here.

Then why don't you go?

Saying and doing...
two different things.

Let's get back to astronomy.

It's important to keep studying,
no matter what happens.

Fengmo, you're a very lucky
young man.

A total lunar eclipse...

occurs once every 18 years
in the same place...

and we can see one tonight.

When the Earth blocks the sun's light
from reaching the moon...

the moon seems to disappear
in the Earth's shadow.

Here.

My mother likes to look
at the stars too.

It's beautiful.

Mother.

Andre's brought a telescope.
We've been looking at the moon.

Both hands.

I can't see anything.
No, try again.

Is that better?

Mother, why don't you
come to class?

Chiuming can come with you
if you think it doesn't look right.

She can study too.

That way you won't be
the only woman.

I'd be honoured
if you joined us, lady.

I do not know how to keep
from getting pregnant...

when I sleep with the father
of my sons.

Another baby will surely kill me...

but how do I compete
with my husband's younger wives?

Fengmo's tutor told him
American men...

can only have one wife.

It is so pitiful you had to find
a concubine for your husband.

The girl...

where did you find her?

You like her?

Does he like her?

I like her.
She's an ordinary girl...

but a good one.

You sound like you hired a maid.

Meichen, I feel like a frog...

living in a well...

only seeing the small portion
of the sky.

I have wanted to visit you
many times, Ailian...

to discuss our children's wedding.

But since that foreigner is there, it
would be too shameful for me to meet...

He saved your life, Meichen.

Besides, he's just a priest.

Fengmo even suggested
that Second Lady and I...

should join the class with him.

You seem so changed, Ailian.

You got one!

I caught a duck!
There he is!

Madam, I believe this is yours.

Thank you.

Please, go away.

Go away.

Good-bye, ladies.

It's all right.
He's gone.

He scared me to death.
Did you see his hairy chest?

No wonder they say
that foreigners are half animal.

My little precious!

My poor little baby.

Are you all right?

Lady! Lady! I must speak to you
about the foreigner.

He must have starved to death
in his past life.

It's because of your generosity
he takes all the leftovers...

you usually give to the servants.

Mother, the day after tomorrow
is Andre's birthday.

We must have a banquet for him.
A banquet?

Young Lord, he's not family.

I don't think Old Lady
and your father will agree.

I have an idea.

Foreigners like a huge cake...

with a candle in the middle
for their birthday.

All right.
We can make one for him.

But how big?

Big enough.

I saw these yesterday.

I thought you might like them.

Come see. Take it. Take it.

I like the way you massage me.

Take a seat.

I've been worried about Fengmo.

Perhaps you should attend
a few classes...

and make sure everything's
all right with him.

You must be joking.
I would fall asleep.

Why don't you go?

Perhaps...

if Chiuming came with me.

I will tell my mother.

I can't relax with her!

She doesn't know how
to comfort me. You could.

No, you must not think
of me that way.

It is unfair to Chiuming.

Unfair?

You are so naive.

She's just a puppet.

How could you buy a puppet
with a heart?

She cannot compare with you.

I only do this because you made me.

Do it, now.

Now.

Ying!

Madam, I'm here.

I'm too old.

I can't take care of you forever.

Any questions?

I have a question.

I hope you don't mind.

Not at all.

Have you ever seen your god?

I thought we were prohibited
from discussing religion.

This is not religion.
Why don't you tell us?

No, I have never seen Him.

How can you believe
in what you can't see?

Faith.

He's in everything.

In bread. In water.

In sleeping. In waking.

In feeding the lost children.

Teaching Fengmo and Chiuming,
and talking to you now.

Faith.

<i>Is it selfish if any individual
puts his happiness...</i>

<i>before the happiness of his family?</i>

<i>But if a person is unhappy,
how can he serve his family?</i>

<i>A question.</i>

<i>Are all Chinese marriages arranged?</i>

<i>Marriage has to be arranged.</i>

<i>- Why?
Marriage is a family matter.</i>

<i>And family is the most important
obligation here.</i>

<i>Our sorrows and joys
belong to the family.</i>

<i>What happens when we die?</i>

<i>That's always a very good question.</i>

<i>When we die...</i>

<i>our soul will be free.</i>

<i>Then I can't wait
for my soul to be free.</i>

<i>I always wonder...</i>

<i>why Western people
like to go to church...</i>

<i>to confess how guilty they are.</i>

<i>Well, I always wonder why Chinese
people like to pray for more money...</i>

<i>sons and beautiful wives.</i>

<i>Are people in your country...</i>

<i>allowed to do things that
are forbidden by society?</i>

<i>In theory, everyone's equal...</i>

<i>and has the right to pursue
whatever makes them happy.</i>

<i>I don't think
I have that kind of right.</i>

I've got something to show you.

I brought a photo of my sister
and my mother...

so you can see
how Western women dress.

That's my mother and sister.

They're so beautiful.
You must miss them very much.

Is that you?

You were so cute.

Big and hairy now.
Like a bear.

Who is laughing so loudly?

Your son and your wives, lord.

They are having classes.

Here's the birthday steam cake.

Be careful. It's hot.

Long life, teacher.

How did you know
it was my birthday?

We made a cake for you.
Eat it while it's hot.

I put a lot of sugar, sweet beans
and dried fruits in there.

I had to steam it for two hours.

The candle kept falling down.

It's all right now.

But be careful.

Hey!

Why did you blow out the candle?
I worked so hard.

I made a wish.

Doesn't it smell delicious?

You first.

You don't like it?

No. I like it very much.

We just want you to feel
you're at home.

Fire!

The orphanage is on fire!

God!

Stay there.

It's too late!

Give me some water.
Give me some water!

Are you all right?
Elder Sister!

Breathe. Are you all right?

Where are they taking them?

Our lady has ordered
to move the children...

to the Wu compound.

Let it go.

You gained two kilos.

But it's all in your ears.

It's mine! It's mine!
You can't get me.

Children.

What have you done?
He's dead.

You killed him.
He's dead.

You killed him!

Here's something sweet.

I hope the children
enjoy their watermelon.

Madam, thank you.
We appreciate it very much.

Never mind.

Thank you.

You're alive.

That's all that matters.

You know, I think
Second Wife is distracted.

Her heart is somewhere else.

Once she has a baby,
she will be part of the Wu family...

and her heart will be settled.

Madam, would you send me away
if I said something...

that might make you angry?

Have I ever sent you away yet?

Go on.

I think you should not have risked
your life saving that foreigner.

People are talking.
About what?

Unmentionable things.

If I hadn't gone into
that burning orphanage...

Andre...

I mean, that foreigner
and his children would be dead.

I think we should not let Old Lady
find out about what happened.

Very strange.
Those foreigners...

they like to hold your hands
to show their appreciation.

Makes me embarrassed.

Madam, if I were you...

I would not let that foreigner
touch one hair on my body.

You even let him stay
on our compound.

And the servants, they do not like
serving people from the orphanage.

You should see lord's face.
He's not happy with this either.

What else?

I think you should arrange
for Fengmo's marriage...

and make the orphans go away
from this house as soon as possible.

I thought I had lost it.

I knew it was yours.

The clasp was broken, so...

I fixed it.

Thank you.

Why don't you put it on
so you don't lose it again?

Let me help you.

It's the only thing
you have from your mother...

isn't it?

Electricity. It sounds good.

But it's a waste of money.

Hey, bring me some tea.

Wu, how 'bout your new wife?

Don't be so shy.

You're part of the club now.

We all have several wives.
Isn't that so?

I'm so used to the first wife.

Second Wife, she doesn't
know how to take care of me.

I have an idea.

Come with us
to the flower boat.

There you can really relax, huh?

No, my mother would never allow me.
Your mother?

Come on!

In the dark there's no difference...

between a concubine
and a flower girl.

That's right.

No, no, no, I can't.
I can't.

Leave him alone.
Go home to your wives.

We'll go there without you.

Let's go.

Is my son gonna be absent
from the table tonight again?

Chiuming, where has your husband
been the last few nights?

Ancient, he's been going out
with Mr Kang.

Daughter-in-law...

I hope you haven't been so busy
attending classes...

and taking care of the orphans...

that you have neglected
your duty to the others.

Yes.

Let's eat.

There's my father. Look.

Fengmo, there's your father too.

Hey, don't let him get away.
I can't.

So shameful.
Grab him. Bring him back here.

Awful. I really wish I wasn't
from this family.

Madam! Madam!

Old Lady says she's not going.
She's afraid of this electricity.

Lord says he cannot go either.

Should I still put the basket
in the boat?

No, we cannot go without them.

Mother, everyone is going.

The Wu family will lose face if your
mother appears without your father...

at the celebration.

Maybe I shouldn't go.
No.

We are going.

Just wait till Old Lady
finds out about this.

Electricity!

And so...

we bring our humble town...

into the modern age.

Electricity.

Electricity.

Why?

Can you tell me why?

Could you translate?
I don't understand the dialect.

All right.

This is a story about a girl...

who had to disguise herself
as a boy...

in order to go to school.

In the three years,
we shared the same window.

My feelings for you...
I can understand.

My feelings for you grew
as deep as the sea.

In pairs birds fly.

Lovers' shadows...

forever entwined.

Your smile makes my heart break.

But you know my father
has already arranged my marriage.

A thousand words in my heart.

Still, to express my feelings...

I know not where to start.

What?

Nothing.

I miss you.

I cannot sleep at night.

I miss you.

They flew away together.
I eat but do not taste.

I miss you.

I pick up the brush
but cannot write.

I miss you.

Without you my life is a waste.

I miss you.

They were separated...

and died from love sickness...

and were buried together.

A pair of butterflies...

emerged from their grave...

and flew away together.

If I cannot be with you
in this life...

Then I will be with you
in the next.

You know the story?

All love stories end the same,
don't they?

This is a Western butterfly story.

It's one of my favourite operas.

Just listen.

Why do all love stories
end in tragedy?

Someday you will understand.

No, Mother, I want to know.

Is love a sin?

Love is never sinful.

It's the most beautiful feeling
we can have.

I'm sorry. I think we're forbidden
to talk about this topic.

What if love is forbidden?
Fengmo, stop it.

Teacher, Mr Wu would like
to speak to you.

Let's stop now.

I hope you understand.

It is not appropriate
to talk about relationships...

between a man and a woman
in my house.

What's wrong?

Father, some boys threw stones
and mud at us.

They said we are bananas...

yellow on the outside,
white on the inside.

They say you like that rich Wu lady.

It's all right.
Let's wash up.

It's all right.

I have been concerned
about the rumours.

It's not only your face.

It affects all of our reputations.

"Create in me a clean heart,
O God."

Now that you have enough
foreign education...

you will marry the Kangs' daughter
on the moon festival.

I do not love her.
Love?

Nonsense.

Your marriage was decided
before the two of you were born.

If you force me, I will join
the Communist army.

Then you are not my son.

You must be careful
of the foreigner.

You do not know who he is
and what he really is up to.

I don't understand
why you trust him so much.

Old Lady wants to move that
foreign devil out of the Wu compound.

Lady, I'm so concerned
about you.

It seems you don't
watch out any more.

Are you listening to...

Good evening, Elder Sister.

What are you doing here
at this hour?

Where is Fengmo?
I haven't seen him.

I just saw you right here with him.
It's not true!

You think I'm blind?

I hope you understand.
Your job is to serve your husband.

He doesn't like me.

He kicks me out of the bed.

I don't know what to do.

He goes to the flower boat.
You lie again.

It's true. I swear it!
It's true.

It's also true you're Fengmo's second
mother. Who do you think you are?

I shouldn't have brought you here.

Daughter-in-law...

is the priest still living
in the servants' quarters?

The orphanage
is being repaired, Mother.

We give you money to run the family,
not on someone else.

Teacher?

I have a question.

Can't it wait until class?

If we die,
our soul will be free, right?

Yes, that's true.

I heard you saved the foreigner from
the fire and went to the opera with him.

Does the priest teach class
about men and women?

Move him out of my house.

<i>Help!Somebody help!</i>

Second Lady has killed herself!

Stay here!

What is he doing?

She's conscious.

Let me die!

Stupid girl. She can't even
play dead correctly.

She's going to be all right.

I have to speak with you.

Thank you for saving her.

I can't imagine what would have
happened today without you.

I have one request.
Anything.

Let her go.

I can't.

It's beyond my power.
You brought her here.

You can set her free.

I'm sorry. I can't.

How can I face my family?
What would people say?

What would people think if they knew
Fengmo was in love with her?

How did you know that?

She told me.

She'd rather die
than live here any longer.

Shameless.

Ruin the name of the Wu family.

She seduced my son.
Seduced?

You brought her here!

If I didn't, she could have
died of hunger.

Why are you so cold?

You sacrificed that young girl...

on the bed of a man
old enough to be her father!

Did you really think you could free
yourself by imprisoning another?

Who do you think you are?

A saviour?

You come to China
to save our Chinese children...

to save us?

Why don't you go to your country
to save yourself and your country first?

I thought I knew you.

Good-bye, lady.

<i>A long time ago...</i>

there was a little frog who lived
at the bottom of an old well.

He thought...

the sky was just
this little patch of blue...

above his head.

He had no idea...
Madam Wu!

Where's my son?
Where's my grandson?

Where's my daughter-in-law?

Heaven! Are you trying
to break my old bones?

Ying!

Where the hell are they?

I will go look for them.
Go, go!

Why don't you come home
with me?

Two wives not enough
for you, Mr Wu.

Come home with me.

She is free now.

You can be free too.

But...

she is young.

Times have changed.
And you're so old.

The other day...

when you gave me that birthday
dumpling or whatever it was...

that's the first time I celebrated
my birthday since I was a child.

I feel like I belong here now.

Come.

Here. Can you walk?

Let me help you.

Put me down.

Let me take a look.
I'm fine.

Let me see.
I'm a doctor, remember?

It's all right.
Let me see.

Maybe you sprained it.

Does that hurt?

Yes?
It's all right.

It's all right.

Why are you crying?

<i>Where have you been?</i>

On your knees!

Beg for forgiveness
from your ancestors.

Ancestors, I beg
for your forgiveness.

Apologize for driving
your second wife away!

Forgive me for driving
my second wife away.

Beg for forgiveness
for breaking the family rules!

I beg for forgiveness
for breaking family rules.

Beg for forgiveness
for losing face.

I beg for forgiveness
for losing face.

Beg for forgiveness...

Great Grandma!

It is a blessing that
she did not live to see this war.

I've heard the Japanese have killed
hundreds of people in the north.

May I pray for her?

Pray then.

My mother can have
one more heaven to go to.

Forgive me, Father.

Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

You are not really leaving,
are you?

I am.

Where are you going?

As far away as possible.

Fengmo, I'm sorry.

It's hard for me
to explain to you.

You're my son.

But I think only you
can understand.

Mother...

how could you?

How can I understand you...

when you bought a girl
to warm my father's bed?

How can I understand you...

when you drove Chiuming
to try to kill herself?

How can I understand you...

when my father visits
the flower boat every night?

How can I understand you
when you betray us with my teacher?

Because...

it has taken me 40 years...

to feel the way
you feel about Chiuming.

I have come to say good-bye.

I am joining the Communist army.

So you've decided.

You can find Chiuming in the
missionary school near Wuxi church.

How's your mother?

Changed.

Go see her.

Thank you for all you have done.

Take care of my mother.

God bless you.

I've heard...

you sent a message
to tell the foreigner...

to come for my care.

Yes.

I told the servants
not to give him your message.

Why?

I'm not dead yet!

Children! Children, in the house!

Put your things down!
Inside! Inside!

In the house, hurry!

Quickly, in the house!

Get in, hurry!

Under the bed!

Now! There's no more time.

Now! Go down!
Get on the boat!

Get on the boat!

I'm not leaving.

You want to die?

I'm not leaving with you.
Get on the boat!

You don't understand.

I'm sorry.

Come with me, woman.

Now!

Not this time.

I've served you for 24 years.
Not any more.

Listen! You belong to me.
No. I belong to nobody.

You're nobody without the Wu family!

Don't leave me alone!
I'm scared!

If you no longer care for me,
think of your sons!

My lord is looking for her!
They had a fight and she disappeared.

Take the children.
I'll meet you at Wuxi church.

It's too dangerous.
The Japanese have taken the town.

She must be trapped there!

Daughter?
Where are you, daughter?

Last night a foreign priest
asked me...

if I was still alive
to give this to you.

He was here?
He saved our lives.

Tell me. Where is he?

Tell me the names that
Father Andre had given you, children.

Honesty.

Kindness.

Faith.

Truth.

Humanity.
Mercy.

Light.
Grace.

Sunbeam.
Star.

Dawn.

Charity.

Rose.

Mother, I don't have a name.

Your name will be Love.
