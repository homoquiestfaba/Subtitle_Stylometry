This is it.

Oh.

You can do this.

Woman: 5,6, 7, 8.

Barrel turn! Barrel turn!

And pirouette!

Stop! Enough!

What is wrong with you guys?
You look older than me!

We open in three weeks.
This is <i>not</i> hard.

It's music, it's movement,

It's passion.

Just let your body
<i>feel</i> the beat.

Just dance.
It's gonna be okay.

Ohh!
Oh, these knobby knees!

See? Not so difficult.

Oh, my gosh,
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

Just because you're my daughter
doesn't mean you can be
late for rehearsal.

Oh, harper.
Is it the knee again?
Uh-huh.

Come on,
let's help her up.
I'll get some aspirin.

Are you sure
you're okay?
I'm fine.

Why were you late?

And don't tell me
it's that wedding stuff again.

The ceremony is Saturday.
We've been very busy
with the--

I know, and I agreed
to let you have
the weekend off

As long as it
didn't affect rehearsals.

Today is Monday,
the investors are coming,

And we have to show them
that we're ready.

I'm dropping out
of the show.

What are you talking about?
You can't drop out.
You're the lead.

Marco and I discussed it,

And after the wedding I want
to stay in Italy with him.

Pumpkin, we go on
in three weeks.
You can't stay in Italy.

This show is gonna
make you a star!

Oh, I see. This is
his idea, isn't it?

No. We made the decision
together.

Well, you didn't
discuss it with me.

Amanda!
Where is that aspirin?!

Help me look
through these bags.

Not one of you
has any aspirin?

How do you call
yourselves dancers?

Come here. Julia.

Go see if the korean market
is still out of aspirin.

If so, buy booze.

As for the rest of you,
if you value your careers
and your lives,

Keep searching.

Harper:
<i>You've only</i>

Known him three months.
I love him.

I know how you're
feeling right now.

I did this whirlwind romance,
got totally swept away,

And look what happened to me.

After your father left me--
you threw him out.

Whatever dad
did or didn't do--

There wasn't much
he didn't do.

I'm not gonna let you
ruin your life

By trading in your dreams

For some ridiculous
fairy tale in Italy.

I want the fairy tale!

A role like this only comes
around once in a lifetime!

A love like this
only comes around
once in a lifetime.

What's that?

Hmm.

"vitality tonic."

Eighty proof.

The playboy prince?

Is this who you want to
give everything up for?

He's young, gorgeous,
italian,

He's the heir to
a textile fortune--

Women throw themselves at him.

And boy,
does he catch 'em!

Not anymore.
He's done playing the field.

He's left that all behind.
He promised.

Promises. What about
the promise you made to me

To come back
after the wedding
and be my star?

I know. I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna
change my mind.

You are contractually
obligated to perform
in the show!

You're gonna sue me?

For our own good.

Mirabella!

Mirabella, you cannot
walk out on me!

You are <i>so</i> banned
from my wedding!
You wouldn't dare! Ohh!

I'm getting on a plane tonight,
and I don't want to
see you there!

You can't ban me!
I'm your <i>mother!</i>

Amanda, aspirin!

I've got something
for you.

Aramid o'malley's
astonishing vitality tonic.

Never heard of it.
It's eighty proof.

Well, that'll work.

Oh.
Thank you, julia.

We're already over schedule.

We can't postpone the show.

Harper, the investors
are showing up in two days.

Reschedule. Tell 'em
we'll be ready on Monday.

What?! No!
The wedding
is on Saturday!

If it happens.

Harper, you cannot
stop this wedding.

She's under his sway.
She's not thinking clearly.

Runs in the family.

Harper, are you flying
all the way to Italy?

Don't get on that plane,
harper.

<i>â™ª ( pop music</i>
<i>sung in italian ) â™ª</i>

Ohh!
Ow!

Excuse you!

Knee hurts.

Oh. Uhh.

Aspirin.

Where is that aspirin?

Ah...

"look younger than you feel."

That does me no good.

Hmm.

Not bad. Kind of minty.

Whoa.

Whoa...

Whoa.

Ooh-whoa.

Whoa!

Oh!

Oh...

Whoa! Ah...

Whoa! <i>Whoa!</i>

( coughing )

( turns on faucet )

Aaaah!

Aaah!

Aaaah!

Oh, god! What's happening?
Is this a blood clot?

Am I having an aneurysm?

What the hell
is in this stuff?

I'm...

I'm young.

Oh...

My...

God.

â™ª clock strikes
upon the hour â™ª

â™ª and the sun
begins to fade â™ª

â™ª there's still enough time
to figure out â™ª

â™ª how to chase
my blues away â™ª

â™ª I've done all right
up till now â™ª

â™ª it's the light of day
that shows me how â™ª

â™ª and when the night falls

â™ª the loneliness calls

â™ª oh, I wanna dance

â™ª I wanna feel the heat

â™ª oh, I wanna dance

â™ª and I wind up feeling down

â™ª I need a man

( cell phone rings )

Amanda.

Who's this?

It's me.
<i>Harper?</i>

Are you okay?

You sound weird.
<i>Ahem.</i>

Ahem! My throat is
a little swollen.

I must have caught
something on the flight.

How's the knee?
<i>It's, um...</i>

Better. A lot better,
actually.

That tonic really
did the trick.

One of the dancers found it
here in the theater. Why?

I had the tiniest,
sort of miniscule,
you know...

Harper.

Reaction.

What kind of reaction?
Are you sick?

I am definitely feeling
very strange right now.

You should go
to the doctor.

Amanda, I am fine.
I'm fine. I just--

I need you to figure out
where this stuff came from.

<i>I'll see what I can do,</i>
<i>but you need to come home</i>
<i>right now. We need to find</i>

A replacement
for mirabella <i>today.</i>

Yeah. I came here
to convince mirabella

That marco is not worth
giving up her career for.

And now I know
how to prove it.

What are you going to do?
<i>I'm going to seduce marco.</i>

<i>You're going to seduce</i>
<i>the playboy prince?</i>

I'm going to show her
that lover boy here
isn't cut out to keep promises.

Just find out what you can
about that tonic

<i>And call me back.</i>

Excuse me, sir.

I'll have you know that
I'm an almost-married woman.

Oh, that's all right,
I'm an almost-married man.

And this is how you choose
to spend your last few
precious hours of freedom?

Hours?
I only need five minutes.

Ew!
( both laughing )

What do we have here?

Put that down!
No, no!

In a marriage
there are no secrets.

We're not married yet!
Not for a couple of days.

So we do have secrets!
You started your novel?

No!
Oh, great!

Like father, like daughter.
No!

He's not a novelist.
He teaches comparative
literature at nyu.

Besides, I'm gonna stay in bed
with you all day
and have six kids. Stop!

They're my vows.

Sorry. Sorry.

Hmm. So...

How are yours coming along?
Great!

I mean, that's really
important to you, right?

That we both
write our own?

Yes.
It's very important.
It's the <i>most</i> important.

It's the one chance we have
to stand up in front
of everybody

And say how we really
feel about each other,
speak from our hearts.

And I do love you
with all my heart.

Me too.

â™ª I wanna tell you

â™ª but there's
so many words to say â™ª

â™ª I wanna tell you
but the words get in my way â™ª

â™ª it's all there
on the tip of your tongue â™ª

â™ª my heart's so full,
brain goes numb â™ª

â™ª so I'll just ask you,
do you? I do â™ª

â™ª me too
â™ª so I'll just ask you

â™ª do you? I do
â™ª me too

â™ª wish I could tell you

â™ª that you make me
feel like I shine â™ª

â™ª and I'm so proud
to be yours and to
call you mine â™ª

â™ª it's all there in
the beat of my heart â™ª

â™ª just open your mouth
and start â™ª

â™ª so I'll just ask you,
do you? I do â™ª

â™ª me too
â™ª so I'll just ask you

â™ª do you? I do
( knocking on door )

Noelle: Mirabella?
Come in!

Seating emergency.
Total disaster. Come quick.

Just a minute.
I'm gonna change.

Sorry, duty calls.

Noelle:
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

I don't even know
who this person is.

Young harper:
Am I in the right place?

Surprise!

And--and you are?

You don't remember me?

Debbie hayworth.
Second cousin once removed.

Aunt marjorie's side?
Ohh. Okay,

Your grandmother
and my great-uncle--

I'm sorry,
too many details.

You must be on
my mother's list.

We played together
all the time as kids.

Remember the treehouse
uncle eddie built in
the back of the barn?

Of--of course!
The old treehouse!

God, it's been forever.
You look so...

So much like my mother
when she was young.

Really?

Yeah,
the spitting image.
It's weird.

It's <i>really</i> weird.

Aunt marjorie always
said the same thing.
And--and I said,

"well, if I have to
look like somebody,

I'm so glad
it's aunt harper."

I mean, is she just
a timeless beauty, or what?

And--and so talented.

Aunt marjorie always
called her "superstar."

I really hate to break up
the family reunion,

But we have
a rehearsal dinner
nightmare on our hands.

See?
Oh, gosh, these
italian family feuds.

They last for 700 years.

And I don't know where I'm gonna
put my great-aunt birdie.

She came in
all the way from boston.

Interesting color scheme.
Is that...Puce?

Bold choice.

I thought your mom said
you were going with

Dusky rose
and gold accents.

No, that's what her mom
<i>wanted</i> her to go with.

Pink and gold are classics.

Old-fashioned.

Tasteful.
Boring.

Oh, my gosh!

Debbie,
you fixed it!
Thank you!

Oh! You have <i>got</i> to come
to my bachelorette party.

Bachelorette party?

Oh, yeah, we're family.
You have to come.

We have champagne
and mani-pedi's.
Mani-pedi's.

Yay!
Yay!

Well, I'll get
settled in, then.

Okay.
All right.
All right.

We'll see you
for mani-pedi's.

All: Mani-pedi's!

Amanda!

The tonic.
What have you got?

We have a bigger problem.

I spoke to the investors.

Amanda, the tonic.

Harper, this is serious.

You need to come home
right now. I can't do this.

I am in a situation here,
amanda. I need information.

What kind of situation?
How crazy

<i>Is it over there?</i>

( camera snaps )

I'd say it's getting
pretty crazy, don't you think?

Who's that?
She looks familiar.

Are you in my office?
What?

<i>Look around.</i>
<i>( sighs )</i>

Aaaaah!

<i>Amanda!</i>

<i>Amanda.</i>

Amanda?

Who is this?

It's <i>me,</i> amanda!
Now focus! The tonic!

No, you're not.
That is impossible.

You have worked
for me for 15 years.

<i>We have mounted</i>

22 productions together,
and turned

<i>Three unknowns</i>
<i>into broadway stars.</i>

And help me figure out
what is in this tonic
that turned me young,

I will fire you
without hesitation or regret!

Now pull yourself together!

Oh, my god. It <i>is</i> you.

Thank you.
What have you got?

<i>Um...</i>

Oh, god. The stuff
is really old, harper.

It was used for

<i>Rheumatism, gout, um...</i>

Melancholia, and impotence.

What about side effects?

Well, I've already
looked online.

The company's been
out of business
for decades.

Find out: Does it wear off,
and if so, can I take more.
You got it? Find out.

( exhales )

The things I do
for my daughter.

Hi.

Hello.

Debbie hayworth.

Marco vitturi.

You must be related to
mirabella. You look like her.

She looks like me.
We're second cousins.

Once removed.
Aunt marjorie's side.

Right. Listen to this.

"dear mirabella,

"you are so beautiful.

"I want to never sleep
or even blink again

"just so I can stare at
your beautifulness forever...

Until I die."

Too over the top?

Wow. That is, um...
Yeah, that's really bad.

It's terrible.

But it was mirabella's idea
for us to write our own vows
for the wedding,

And...I don't know,

I have no idea
what I'm gonna say.

Looks to me like
you can't <i>stop</i> figuring out
what to say.

True enough.

Love can make you
a little crazy sometimes.

That's not your reputation,
you know.

Yeah. I know.

Must be really hard
to give that up.

Not really.

Mirabella must be
very special to you.
Oh, she is.

She has this--

I mean, she's so--

When we first met,
I was like--

Oh, god.

She's--everything.

So it's kind of hard,
you know, to--

She has <i>the</i> most
beautiful blue eyes.

Yeah. Yeah,
she got those
from her dad.

And this beautiful smile
where one side of her mouth
kind of turns up--

Kind of like yours.
Think she's got a secret?

Yeah, right.
Something, uh...Secret.

Oh, and she--she has
these beautiful hands.

Oh, dancer's hands.

You're...A dancer too?

Runs in the family.

I'm--I'm sorry, have--
have we met before?

Not in this lifetime.

Are you sure? Because--
oh, I'm sure.

You would definitely
remember meeting me.

You know, for second cousins,
you and mirabella...

Yes?
It's strange how much
you remind me of her.

This is so going to work.

Noelle, how many times
did you lose your virginity?

I have no idea, but hey,

If the stars align
I might lose it again
this weekend.

( laughter )

Seriously though, em,
you're so lucky to have
found a guy like marco.

He's so hot and rich...

And hot and rich! Hello!

Okay, mirabella,
it's your turn.

Oh, no.
Somebody else go.

But your story's so good.

Okay. She was 16 years old,

She told her mom
she was spending the weekend
at a friend's house--

I'm that friend,
that influence--
and instead,

We snuck off to paris!
What?!

I mean, wow.

And there,
after staying up all night

Walking the banks of the seine
hand in hand,

Talking until sunrise,

Whispering their life stories
to each other--

Noelle, no!
You have got
to be kidding me.

Our dear, sweet,
innocent mirabella

Laid herself down
with that hot, sexy
french man

And gave up
her precious flower.
At sixteen?!

It was very romantic.

By the end of the night
we knew everything
about each other

And we were like
two ships passing.

And he was really very sweet.
Wait a second.

How the heck did you
get out of the country
without your mother knowing?

Her mom was at
an out-of-town preview.

Her dad gave us permission.
We told him it was
a class trip.

My mom didn't even
notice I was gone.

Okay, that is not fair.
She's a very busy woman.

A single mom,
a demanding career--

Debbie, my mom is, was,
and always will be

Way too self-centered
to think about anybody
but herself.

She took you to dance classes
three times a week
when you were a kid.

Noelle:
What are you <i>doing?</i>

The sun is very bad
for your skin.

So, mirabella, tell me
about this french guy.

Did you think
you were in love with him?

Okay, uh, no.
I mean, it was
a great experience,

But it wasn't like
how it is with marco.

Right. Marco.
The playboy prince.

I'm sorry. I just--
I read that.

He retired that title
when he met me. Besides,
he's not a real prince.

( laughter )
but he is a real italian.

I wouldn't worry too much
about that, though.

Not every italian guy
has to have a mistress,
right?

Right?
I'm not worried about it.

I knew marco was the right guy
right from the very beginning.

â™ª I made it through
the wilderness â™ª

â™ª somehow I made it through

â™ª didn't know
how lost I was â™ª

â™ª until I found you

â™ª I was beat

â™ª incomplete

â™ª I'd been had

â™ª I was sad and blue

â™ª but you made me feel

â™ª yeah, you made me feel

â™ª shiny and new

â™ª like a virgin

â™ª touched for
the very first time â™ª

â™ª like a virgin

â™ª when your heart beats

â™ª next to mine

â™ª gonna give you
all my love, boy â™ª

â™ª my fear is fading fast

â™ª been saving it all for you

â™ª 'cause only love can last

â™ª you're so fine
and you're mine â™ª

â™ª make me strong

â™ª yeah, you make me bold

â™ª oh, your love thawed out

â™ª yeah, your love thawed out

â™ª what was scared and cold

â™ª like a virgin

â™ª touched for
the very first time â™ª

â™ª like a virgin

â™ª when your heart beats

â™ª next to mine

â™ª whoa, whoa, whoa-oh

â™ª whoa-whoa, whoa-oh

â™ª whoa-whoa-oh

â™ª like a virgin

â™ª touched for
the very first time â™ª

â™ª like a virgin

â™ª when your heart beats

â™ª next to mine

â™ª like a virgin

( cell phone rings )

Hello?
<i>Harper?</i>

Any good news, amanda?

Okay. Okay, okay.

<i>The good news.</i>
<i>The trunk that the tonic</i>

Was found in was owned
by some old vaudeville guy,

Tom dorian.
<i>Never heard of him.</i>
<i>Is that it?</i>

And now the not-so-good news.

The investors found out about
mirabella leaving the show.

Oh, no! How?!
<i>One of the dancers</i>

Spilled, and it gets worse.

They're going to recast her.

They can't do that.
<i>Yes,</i>

They can. Look,

<i>I told the investors</i>

<i>Mirabella'd be back</i>
<i>for rehearsal on Monday,</i>

But if mirabella is not
back here for it,

They're going to replace her.
And you.

We don't need a new lead.
Mirabella is coming back.

( laughing )
whoo!

And they wouldn't dare
replace me.

Why am I scared?

Don't say anything to anybody.

Tell them I will
be back on Monday

<i>With our star.</i>

This wedding is
not going to happen.

â™ª I make it through
the wilderness â™ª

â™ª somehow
I made it through â™ª

â™ª I didn't know
how lost I was â™ª

â™ª until I found you

â™ª I was beat, incomplete

â™ª I'd been had,
I was sad and blue â™ª

â™ª but you made me feel

â™ª yeah, you made me feel

â™ª shiny and new

â™ª like a virgin

â™ª touched for...
The very first time â™ª

I-I can't believe
you just did that.

I can't believe
<i>I</i> just did that.

I've had too much to drink.

Oh, my gosh,
I am so sorry!

I don't know
what came over me!

Maybe it was the champagne--
no, no, no,
you don't understand.

I swore I was through
with other women, for good.

Debbie, mirabella dared me
to be a better person,
and I thought I could.

Because she believed in me
more than anyone has

In my entire life.

But now this?

I don't think I can be
the man she wants me to be,

Or the man she deserves.

I'm not good enough
for her. Right?

I'm sorry, debbie,
this isn't your fault.
It's mine.

I have to go.

Oh! This is it.

Can you believe
I'm getting married tomorrow?

No, I really can't.

Debbie, what's wrong?

Nothing. Nothing.

I'm fine, it's just
this is the first time
I've seen you in your dress.

It seems like just yesterday
you were a little girl.

We. <i>We</i> were little girls.

Dancing around
the back yard together,

Playing with
each other's hair...

This is the most
beautiful you've looked
in your entire life.

Are you happy?

Yes!

How could I not be?

I'm getting everything
that I ever wanted.

But you're giving up
your dream to be a dancer
to stay here with marco.

( laughs )
debbie.

Can I...
Can I tell you a secret?

I never wanted
to be a dancer.

That was my mom's dream,
not mine.

What? Never?

I mean, maybe for
a little while,
when I was a kid.

I mean,
I worshipped my mother.

You remember, she was
this big glamorous star

And everyone loved her.

And I wanted to be
just like her...

For a while.

What happened?

I grew up.

I can't believe
you never said anything
to your mom.

Well...

I didn't want
to disappoint her.

When my mom blew her knee out,

She wanted me
to be the big star that...

She couldn't be anymore.

And when I met marco,

I finally realized
I can't live my life for her,

No matter how much I love her.

It was like...

The first time
marco and I met,

I could hear this little voice
telling me,

"this guy's the one."

Ya know? Like...

The future was talking to me,

Telling me I had already
spent a whole lifetime with him.

Does that sound crazy?

No.

It's the most romantic
thing I've ever heard.

Woman:
Senorina mirabella?

Oh. You know, I forgot
to thank you for standing in
for noelle today, debbie.

I--

I have no idea where
she could possibly be.

Debbie, where are you going?

See you at
the rehearsal dinner!

( speaks italian )

Scott: Dude,
you gotta slow down.
I can't keep up.

But wait a sec.
She said <i>she</i> kissed <i>you?</i>

Why are we freaking out
about this?

Because I didn't stop her--
and I should have.

I shouldn't have even
put myself in a situation
where that could have happened.

I broke my promise
to mirabella.

Dude, you only have to feel
guilty <i>after</i> the wedding,

That's the whole point
of getting married.

Sage advice from the guy
who defines a long-term
relationship

As a three-day weekend in aspen.

I promised her
I was done with other women.

I don't know,
maybe I'm just not
cut out for monogamy.

I've got a number
of two swedish flight attendants

Who can meet us on your boat
in three hours!

What? I'm not
judging you, man.

You weren't there.
She was like
some fairy creature.

She put a spell on me.

She had these
soulful brown eyes,
like a gypsy.

And she smelled like
the perfume my mother
used to wear.

It was weird. There was
something about her,

Like...Magical.

I have to cancel
the wedding.

Oh, god, what have I done?

I've got to fix this.

Name?
Ryan hutton.
Father of the bride.

Is harper hutton here?

She is not on the list.

About fifty,
eyes like a tiger shark.

The unmistakable aroma
of chanel number 5 and pure evil
gives her away.

Not on the list, sir.

Keep an eye out.
She'll never be able
to stay away.

I got your back.
Thanks.

( voices outside )

...About my age,
about this tall?

Ryan.

Mirabella: <i>Debbie,</i>
<i>are you in there?</i>

Something's happened.
Debbie?

<i>Can you come out?</i>

I need to talk to you.

Not feeling well!

Why don't you
talk to noelle?

That's just it,
I can't.

<i>She and marco</i>
<i>kissed last night.</i>

Just a sec!

<i>Debbie, what's wrong?</i>

I thought--you know,
didn't we sort of bond?

<i>I haven't seen noelle</i>
<i>all day. She disappeared.</i>

<i>I know it was her.</i>

Debbie, are you okay?

Not so good!

I shouldn't go through
with it, right?

<i>He kissed another girl.</i>
<i>He broke his promise to me.</i>

What choice do I have?

Oh...Oh...

Debbie?

<i>I can't go through with it.</i>

Right?

Oh...Ohh...

Oh!

Uhh! Uhh!

Ohh!

<i>Hi, this is amanda.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

Amanda, where <i>are</i> you?
Call me back.

I need to know does this stuff
work more than once! Ohh!

Mirabella!
Dad!

I'm so glad you're here!

Oh, honey.

Is she here?
Dad--

I'm telling ya,
she won't be able to resist.

Honey, what's wrong?

Dad, I think
mom might have been right
about marco the whole time.

Your mother hasn't been right
about anything since 1987

When she said,
"let's name her mirabella."
noelle: Look who it is.

Hi, noelle.

What's wrong with her?
I don't know.

Pre-wedding jitters,
I guess.

Have you talked to her?

Harper: <i>Oh!</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

Sounds like an elephant
passing a kidney stone.

Has to be debbie.
Who's debbie?

Mirabella's cousin,
debbie hayworth?

Never heard of her.

Ooh. Too many
tequila shooters.

Debbie, are you all right?
Mm-hmm.

Okay, well, then you need
to suck it up,

Because I have got a hangover
that could bring down a t-rex.

After the dance-off
is all a blur.

And where
is mirabella?

â™ª so I guess it's over

â™ª there's nothing left to say

â™ª take the ring
off my finger â™ª

â™ª and just call it a day

â™ª thought we had forever

â™ª but that was yesterday

â™ª you're such a liar

â™ª wish I saw it
on your face â™ª

â™ª but you did it so well

â™ª can somebody just

â™ª tell me how

â™ª how can I remember
to forget â™ª

â™ª when my heart
just won't let me â™ª

â™ª make myself unlove you

â™ª tell me that
it's not true â™ª

<i>â™ª I know all the reasons</i>

â™ª I just can't
believe them â™ª

â™ª and pretend we never met

â™ª how can I remember
to forget? â™ª

â™ª wish that I could hate you

<i>â™ª so I could let you go</i>

â™ª wish I never met

â™ª the one I want the most

<i>â™ª I could fill an ocean</i>

â™ª with all the tears
I've cried â™ª

â™ª tell me you
were joking â™ª

<i>â™ª just a dream</i>
<i>I had last night â™ª</i>

â™ª but I'm wide awake

â™ª and I want you so much

â™ª right now

â™ª how can I remember
to forget these emotions â™ª

â™ª and all the plans we made

â™ª like we'd never happened,
make my heart unbreak â™ª

<i>â™ª I know it's really over</i>

<i>â™ª but I just don't know how</i>

â™ª how can I remember
to forget â™ª

â™ª when my heart
just won't let me â™ª

â™ª make myself unlove you

â™ª tell that it's not true

â™ª I don't want to leave you

â™ª I just can't believe, no

â™ª and pretend we never met

â™ª how can I remember
to forget? â™ª

â™ª forget

â™ª oh

â™ª ooh

( sniffing )

Hmm. Chanel number five.

Harper?

Harper.

Oh, my--

This is not
going to end well.

( door opens )

What are you doing?

Why aren't you getting dressed
for the rehearsal dinner?

I'm leaving.
Marco and noelle
kissed last night, remember?

Moonlight magic. Gag.

My mom was right
about him, debbie.
He's never gonna change.

Have you...
Talked to him yet?

No. I know that I have to--
don't. Don't!

This could all just be
normal jitters. Cold feet.

It's not just about
a kiss, debbie.

Marco can't--

He can't express
his feelings for me.

Every single time
it comes up, he clams up.

I just-- I think
that I made a big mistake.

I don't think that
he's ready for marriage.

That is not true.
It's not true. Marco <i>loves</i> you.

Look, I know how you're feeling.
My ex cheated on me.

And I bet that
you dumped him.
Oh, I did. But....

I didn't dump him
because he cheated,

I dumped him because he cheated
and lied to me about it.

I gave him a chance
to come clean,

But by then it was too late.

That's terrible,
debbie. I'm sorry.

Listen, I speak
from experience.

If marco tells you the truth
about what happened,

You will know that
it was just a stupid mistake

And he is so sorry.

Can you handle that?

I don't know.

We have this huge dance
in front of everyone

At midnight after
the rehearsal dinner.

It's a vitturi
family tradition.

Okay. Give him until
midnight, then.

Can you do that?

Okay, until midnight.

Good.

How'd you get so smart
about this stuff?

Because I have an old soul.

It's gonna be okay,
pumpkin.

"pumpkin"?
My mom calls me that.

Does she?
That's so funny.
My mom calls me that too.

All right, well,
I gotta go.

But debbie,
what if he doesn't--

Doesn't tell the truth?

Mr. Hutton.

I'm so glad you're here.

Marco.

Oh, I'm sorry I missed
your bachelor party.

I hope you
behaved yourself.

Well, actually,
I messed up.

I got drunk, and I don't know
how it all happened,

But it ended up
with me kissing someone
who is not mirabella.

But it didn't mean anything,
and the other girl
kind of kissed me, really.

But I made this promise
to mirabella that I was
through with all that.

And now I don't
know what to do.

Sit down.

I want you to
look me in the eye
and tell me the truth--

Do you love my daughter?
Absolutely.
With all my heart, sir.

All right, then.
I can help you fix this,

But you have to do
exactly what I say.

I know I have to
tell her the truth.
<i>No.</i>

Don't tell her the truth.

You'll only end up hurting her,
and I don't want that to happen.

Believe it or not,
I was once in your shoes--

And <i>now</i> look at me.
You're divorced.

Exactly.
Because I told the truth!

You know, your divorce
is why mirabella is
so worried about me.

It was really hard on her.
I know it was.

Telling mirabella the truth
won't change anything.

I don't want to lie to her.

If you love her,
you    <i>ha</i>to lie.

You can't tell her the truth,
no matter what.

Clear?

All right.

Hey, where ya goin'?

To talk to a ghost.

Oh! Where did that boy go?

Harper.

It <i>is</i> you!
It is not!

What the hell's
going on here?

How can--how can you
look like this?

I'm sure I don't know you,
so if you'll just excuse me--

Harper, your ass.
What?

I recognized it
in the bathroom.

I know that ass.
I fell in love with that ass.

God help me, I spent
the better part of the eighties
worshipping that ass.

Really?

It <i>is</i> you.

Hello, ryan.
It's been a while.

I need a drink.
I'll get it for you.
Come.

I also need a priest.

Gotta be a priest
around here somewhere,
this is Italy.

Where are
all the priests?

Oh, my god. Will you stop
being so dramatic?

I have a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

There is <i>nothing</i>
<i>reasonable about this--</i>
<i>or you.</i>

Okay, just take
a deep breath--

Don't--
don't tell me what to do.

Where are you going?

To find a cop.
This can't be legal.

( coughing )

W-what happened?

You're going to be
very angry.

Distinct possibility,
if you're involved
in any way.

My knee was the size
of a grapefruit, ryan,

And--and there was this tonic,
and it is <i>magical.</i>

And I took a sip
and I turned young.

Amanda found it
in the back of the theater--

Lord knows how long
that's been there--
but I had no choice.

So in a way,
it's kind of like fate.

And I hated marco,
I hated him,

But it turns out
he really loves her,
and she really loves him back,

And okay, I admit,
I originally came here
to stop the wedding--at first.

But    <i>the</i>you know,
as it turns out,

I, um, I kissed him...
Of course.

And now it's all gone
terribly wrong somehow.

Well, then,
you haven't
lost your touch.

This isn't a joke, ryan.

Seriously, harper, how could
you do something like this
to our daughter?

I know, I know,
it's terrible.

Are you mad?
Hold on.

Did you drug me?
Of   <i>cours</i>i drugged you.

You were gonna drop the dime
on me. Plus, I really need
your help with this.

You...Drugged me!

I was <i>thinking</i>
<i>about our daughter!</i>

Oh, sure you were!

Wha--

Aaaah!

Right.

Ryan?

Ryan!
Hmm...

Ryan. Ryan.
Huhh!

What did you
do to me this time?

Whose voice is that?

Is that--(coughs)--

hey, that's <i>me.</i>

Why do I sound so weird,
harper?!

Oh, my god.
Harper, this...

Is a miracle.

I know, I know,
you're young,

I've been there,
I've done that.
Listen to me.

Yeah!
I have ruined our daughter's
one chance at love.

So I need you to
help me fix it.

Yeah, well, you can check that
off your to-do list,

Because I already fixed it.
What do you mean?

Marco spilled
the whole can of beans.

I told him no witness,
no crime. Just deny
till he dies.

It's all good.

No. Ryan! No--

Ryan!!!

Mirabella overhead marco
talking about the kiss.

He   <i>ha</i>to confess.
Uh-oh.

Yeah. I told her that
if he tells her the truth,

That means he loves her
and she can trust him.

So if he doesn't tell her,
she'll just think he's
trying to cover it up

And that means
he'll cheat on her again.
We have to fix this.

Wow. To see your mind at work
is at once fascinating
and repugnant.

Oh, my god.
You are completely useless.
I remember why I divorced you.

It was not a divorce--

It was an exorcism!

You cheated on me!
One time!
Mid-life crisis.

And then you lied about it.

And when I told the truth,
you kicked me out!

We do not
have time for this.

Where could marco be?
Think, ryan.

Think? I can't think
because I'm 30 years younger
than I was 20 minutes ago!

I can't believe
you got me into this!

Wait-- yes, I can.

Okay, look, I just read
this guy's diary on the plane,

Oh my god,
I hope I'm not too late.

Look, whatever happens,
do <i>not</i> take a third dose.

( disconnects )

Mirabella.

Wow. You look...

What's wrong?
Nothing.

What's wrong with you?
Nothing.

So we're both good.
We're great.

Look...

I don't want any secrets
between us.

That's not the way
to start a marriage.

I totally agree.

So...You would tell me the truth
about anything stupid

You might have done
in the past?

Distant, recent, whatever?

Well, um, mirabella,

What I'm trying to say
is that, well, I...

Wait! He's gonna tell her.

Um...

Of <i>course</i> I would.

If I had something,
you know, to confess.

( grunts )

Damn.

Mirabella...

Young harper:
I've seriously messed this up.

And how.

Okay,
what's our plan?

Ha! "our" plan?

Would you stop, <i>please,</i>
look what I can do!
How long does th<i>ohh! Ow!</i> Last?

And help me? We only
have until midnight when
the rehearsal dinner ends.

I can't help it.
This stuff <i>really</i> works.

Of course it works.
It's--(gasps )--

Oh, my gosh, the tonic!
I left it at the bar!

Hmm.

No! No, no!
Where is it?
I don't see it.

( gasps )
what?

Oh. What happened?

Oh, aunt birdie.

She must have chugged
the whole bottle.

What's that
gonna do to her?

I don't want to know.

Aunt birdie?

( gasps )

Oh, my god.
What?

There goes great-aunt birdie.

Proud matriarch
of the hayworth line.

Wow.
She's got some moves.
Runs in the family.

You have really
screwed this up.

( music, chatter )

( whispering )

Hey. I am debbie,
and you are...?
Angus.

Angus?
Angus.

Okay, we only have
until midnight to
get this fixed, <i>angus.</i>

Hey. I know it goes
completely against
your nature

And ever fiber of your being
is screaming at you
to do the opposite,

But you have to
tell the truth.

Let marco off the hook
for this kiss, harper.

Tell him <i>you</i> kissed <i>him.</i>

He's gotta understand
none of this was his fault.

It's the only way
to fix this mess.

You're right.

Ugh!

God, I <i>hate</i> it
when that happens.

Noelle: No, I'm serious.
You look <i>amazing.</i>

Oh, the bride-to-be is here.

Mirabella.

Hey.
Mirabella: Hi.

Thanks for ruining my life.
I thought we were
best friends.

Excuse me?
Back up a sec.
You can drop the act,

Because I know that
you and marco kissed last night.

What are you <i>talking</i> about?

I heard him and scott
talking about it
under the bridge.

"soulful brown eyes,
full of life,
embracing the moment."

Mirabella, I was
really drunk last night,
but I wasn't <i>that</i> drunk.

"mirabella,
you're so lucky!

He's so hot and rich,
<i>and</i> hot and rich!"

Okay, fine!
I was plastered.

After I left you guys, I--

I hit up the bachelor party...

And I can't remember
much after that.
Convenient.

We've been best friends
since seventh grade.
I would never hurt you.

Besides, I'm not
the only one around here
with brown eyes.

The jig is up!
No, no, no! She can't
find out it was me!

What do we do?

We have to
convince her

That there's no way debbie
would have kissed marco.

Okay, how do we do that?

Hey! Hey, hey--
hey, wait.

We lay it on thick.

Come on.

No. No.

â™ª so we back in the club

â™ª with our bodies rockin'
from side to side â™ª

â™ª side, side to side

â™ª thank god the week is done

( cheers, applause )

Bravo! Bravo!

Amazing!

<i>( line out ringing )</i>

( phone ringing )

<i>( line out ringing )</i>

No, don't--
hello?
<i>Dad, where have you been?</i>

I've been looking
for you everywhere.

Hey, honey. What's up?

<i>Where are you?</i>

Who    that guy?
And how did I miss him?
Uh....

<i>Upstairs. Uh, I'm...</i>

Jet lagged.

<i>You sound weird.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

I do feel
very strange right now.

<i>I'm not myself at all.</i>

I'm gonna
go find marco.

Dad...
<i>What is it, honey?</i>

<i>I'm so confused.</i>

<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I can go through</i>

With this wedding.

It's just that mom said
mthat he would never
mbe faithful to me.

<i>And then debbie said</i>
<i>the way I could find</i>
<i>if he would be</i>

<i>Is if he confessed to</i>
<i>kissing noelle last night,</i>

<i>Because that would mean</i>
<i>that he's sorry,</i>
<i>and he didn't.</i>

And I think that it speaks
to a larger character flaw,

And on top if it all,
he can't even tell me
how he feels about me.

Honey, listen.

<i>People are human.</i>
<i>They make mistakes.</i>

I made a lot of mistakes
with your mom.

And she definitely
punished me for it.

But I never stopped loving her

Through any of it.

<i>Even asset seizure?</i>
<i>All the lawyers</i>

In the world weren't able
to change the way
I feel about her.

So then why
did you cheat on her?

( sighs )
because I was selfish...

And lonely and...Insecure.

Your mom was a real star,
honey.

When she blew out her knee,
I wasn't sad. I was thrilled.

I thought, finally

I don't have to share her
with the rest of the world.

But that didn't happen.
She went right back to work

And became
the star choreographer,
the one everyone

Wanted to work with,
everyone adored.

And there I was,
still nobody,

Holding her coat
at parties.

Dad, I had no idea.

What I did to her was
the biggest mistake of my life.

I think I must have always
hoped for a second chance.

But I never thought
I'd get it.

I never felt I deserved it.

After you cheated on mom,
she couldn't trust you anymore.

<i>And now I know why.</i>

And I can't trust marco.
<i>No--</i>

He loves you, honey.

<i>Really?</i>

Where's the proof?

<i>He can't even</i>
<i>talk to me anymore.</i>

I can't go through
with this wedding.
I'm going home.

Mirabella--

Damn.

â™ª ( dance music )

Oh, no! Not now!

Hello?

Mrs. Hutton?

What are you doing here?

I know I'm not
supposed to be here.

If you came to stop the wedding,
you're too late.

The wedding's not happening.

I know. I spoke to debbie.
She told me everything.

What? W-why?
We're very close.

You were right about me
all along.

I broke my promise to her,
and then I lied about it.
When mirabella finds out--

Marco, shut up.

I flew all the way here
to tell you.

I know debbie.
I've known her
all her life.

She's a rare
and beautiful creature--

Incomparable, actually,
one of a kind.

But she has a problem
letting go.

She loves mirabella.

They used to be
very close...

When they were younger.
Really?

Debbie pushed herself on you.
She wanted to prove that
you weren't good enough.

But why would she do that?
She doesn't even know me.

She...

Had her heart broken
a long time ago.

She loved a man
more than she wanted to,

And it made her feel
out of control, and...

And he cheated on her.

I don't know, I guess
she just stopped believing
in love after that.

And when mirabella
met you...

The playboy prince?
It was like deja vu.

Debbie expected
the worst from you,

And when the worst
didn't happen on its own,
she made it happen.

She made a <i>terrible</i> mistake,
and she is so sorry, marco.

I know I never
approved of you,

But I was wrong--
I should have
given you a chance.

You're a good man.

Don't give up
on mirabella.

I think she might have
given up on <i>me.</i>

Go. Look for her.
Tell her how much
you love her.

I don't think
she'll believe me.
Prove it to her.

Find a way.

I'll try.

Oh, ryan, look at you.

The tonic didn't
last very long, did it?

Probably from trying
to keep up with you
on the dance floor

Like back in the day.

I knew I still
had it in me.

now I have proof.

Oh, my gosh. Proof!
Wha--

What?

What are we doing?

We're looking for a book.
A big book.

What's in the book?
Marco's wedding vows.

We have to find it--

( men speaking italian )

What the hell
are you doing?
I'm trying to hide you.

Ryan, they're on marco's side.
They don't even know me.

Oh. I didn't think of that.
I'm sorry.

Apology accepted.
Actually, you're still
a pretty good kisser.

You're not bad yourself.

It's locked!
Why is it locked?!

How important is it
to get into this greenhouse?

The future happiness
of our daughter may
depend on it.

All right.
Get out of the way.

Ohh! Oh...

That was a bad idea.
Are you all right?

Ahhh. Yeah. Yeah.

Oh...

I'm so sorry, harper.
For what?

I don't know.
For all of it.

Everything I didn't do,
everything I did.

Well, it was
a long time ago.

Not so long.

Ever since we split up
I feel like I've been living
someone else's life.

I love you, harper.
I miss you.

I want to come home.

I love you too,
you idiot.

( laughs )

I always have.

Now let's finish this--
for mirabella.

( sighs )
which ones are the vows?

I think all of them.

Grab as many as you can.
And do what?

We have to find mirabella.
You have to show these to her

So you can prove that
marco really loves her.

You think
that's gonna work?
It has to.

Come on.
Right behind you.

Where are you going?

Where does it
look like I'm going?

Wait.
I-I have to tell you--

What?!

Go ahead, marco,
tell me how you really
feel about me.

You're--you look--um...

Well, um...Um--

Wait. Give me a second.

I'm sorry. I don't know
what's wrong with me.

Whenever
I'm around you lately,
I can't speak.

I know. All right?
About the kiss.

So there's nothing
left to say.

But there is.

I love you <i>so</i> much.

I know what
I did was wrong.

I should have never
let it happen.

So then why <i>did</i> you?
I don't know.

But all I can think about
since it happened
is how much I hurt you.

Oh-- this way.

Come on.

Marco: <i>...So beautiful...</i>
<i>This is crazy.</i>

<i>I can--I want to never...</i>
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

What?

Just talk to me.

Tell me right now
in your own words
why you want to marry me.

It's them.

Wait!

What is this?

Here, take some.

"to mirabella
on our wedding day."

Are these...
Your vows?

( both laughing )

â™ª I want to tell you but
there's so many words to say â™ª

â™ª I want to tell you but
the words get in my way â™ª

â™ª it's all there on
the tip of your tongue â™ª

â™ª my heart's so full,
brain goes numb â™ª

â™ª so I'll just ask you,
do you? I do â™ª

â™ª me too
â™ª so I'll just ask you

â™ª do you? I do
â™ª me too

â™ª I promise
I will be there â™ª

â™ª as the years go by

â™ª and I'll be faithful to you
till the day I die â™ª

â™ª just to have
and to hold your hand â™ª

â™ª makes me the luckiest man

â™ª so now I ask you,
do you? â™ª

â™ª I do
â™ª me too

â™ª so now I ask you,
do you? â™ª

â™ª I do

â™ª so many pieces of paper

Both:
â™ª crumpled up and thrown away

â™ª so many
"I'll do it later's" â™ª

â™ª I gotta the nerve
â™ª gotta get the nerve

â™ª why such
crazy behavior? â™ª

â™ª gonna say my vows today

â™ª I can't wait

â™ª oh, oh, oh, oh

â™ª oh, oh, oh

â™ª oh, oh, oh

â™ª do you?
â™ª I do

â™ª me too

â™ª oh, oh, oh

â™ª oh, oh, oh

â™ª oh, oh

â™ª do you?
â™ª I do

â™ª me too

Oh.Did it!
You are still
one amazing woman.

Still?
<i>Always.</i>

Oh, harper,
thanks god!

Amanda!
I have been driving around
these back roads for hours.

This place is
impossible to find.
What are you doing--

Move away from that bottle.
Why? What--

Harper, the third dose
is permanent.

Permanent?
Yes, as in "forever."

And that's a bad thing
because...?
( sighs )

What?

I mean, we're talking
about immortality here.

This is an unimaginable gift--
to be young forever?

You can't just throw this away
without even considering it.

No, no, no.
It's not a gift,
it's a <i>curse.</i>

There's only
one dose left here.

You were going to be
the biggest star broadway
had ever seen.

The stage, the fans,
the spotlight...

And it all would have
happened for you, except...

My knee.

You can have that
all back now.

You can be the new star
of your show.

I could, couldn't I?

And you really
want that for me?

I just want to
make you happy, harper.

That's all I've ever wanted
from the first day we met.

I've just never been
very good at it.

So...Yes.

If this is what
makes you happy,
this is what I want.

No, no, no, no.
Don't be crazy, harper.

You will lose everything.
Can you really say goodbye
to mirabella forever?

Never see your grandkids?

Come on. You can't
give all that up.

It's your choice,
harper.

You were the most handsome man
I'd ever seen.

Noelle: Girl, I cannot believe
but you look so hot! Married.
Thank you.

Mom.

What are you doing here?

Hi, mrs. Hutton.

I'm gonna leave you two
to talk.

I know. I'm banned.

But I've had time
to think about it.

I've just been so wrong
about everything.

I was--
I was wrong about marco.

So wrong.
He's a wonderful guy.

And he loves you,
and love is what
really matters.

I mean, everything else
fades away, but love lasts.

And I'm so proud of you
for knowing that...

And following your heart.

You still mad at me?

Can I come to your wedding?

I couldn't do it
without you.

Oh!

Oh, I love you so much,
pumpkin.

I love you more
than you'll ever know.

How did I ever get
such a smart girl?

I guess I had a good teacher.

Wait.
What about the show?

( laughs )

Today is about
celebrating your dreams,
not mine.

Today my daughter
is getting married! Ha!

Who are you
and what have you done
with my mother?

Oh...It's just
a brand-new me.

Oh. You have got to see
cousin debbie.

She reminds me
so much of you.
Really?

Then she must be
quite a girl.

Come on.

Man: You may now
kiss the bride.
