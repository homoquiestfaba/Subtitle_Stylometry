<i>When you grow up in a big city like
Miami, you can easily get lost.</i>

<i>Beyond the skyscrapers and
palm trees in my neighborhood.</i>

<i>Just a few miles away from South Beach, but
the difference between heaven and earth.</i>

<i>When you grow up in a place like this,</i>

<i>very quickly realize that should speak louder,</i>

<i>if you want to meghalljanak.</i>

<i>Because everyone has a voice.</i>

<i>And there comes a time when you have
to shout, fight for what you want.</i>

<i>Me and my friends just came out this time.</i>

<b> <i> STEP UP REVOLUTION 4 </ b></i>

I say 50% chance to get to jail tonight.

Yeah, maybe.

Are you ready?
You're kidding, right?

<i>The band.</i>

Guys, look at this.

Look! - But the king!
â™ªCome on, we're late!

I did not pay what they are doing.

Immediately turn.
It would be nice!

The new manager kÃ¶tekedhetnÃ©k.

What's up, guys?

Just be careful!

<i>News of the day today, the
transformed Ocean Drive</i>

<i>some say it was art, others
that the public nuisance.</i>

<i>Started normally, and cars and
people appear out of thin air...</i>

<i>I hope the police find them and imprisoned.</i>

<i>The most amazing thing I've seen.</i>

<i>We love you, whoever you are</i>

I love you too!
It was crazy! - Where's the waiter?

There is a table for two, a 10 minute wait!

Yes, it is horrible.
The guests are not waiting at the demons.

You must be the new manager. I'm Sean.

I'm your boss, not your boyfriend!

If you have parked the guests kirÃºglak.

Do not worry, man. I'm still your friend.

You should shoot because of the shirt.
â™ª... and what do they want?

<i>Whether we love or hate, there's
the question everyone's lips:</i>

<i>Who is this band?</i>

Devastating am tonight!
Good! Come on, man!

Take a drink, take us up chicks...
Do you see what's in Ireland?

<i>Employees DO NOT SHORE CLUB.</i>

What do you say?

Look at all the workers!
Hey, man!

What's up, dude?

Sorry...

Sorry, give me a drink?

Hey. You give me a beer?

Sure... why not?

I think you're new here.
What?

I said, you can be new here.
Sort of... Yes.

I'm here melÃ³zom. - Are you serious?
â™ªUnfortunately.

Can not be that bad.
Low fizu, no drop.

And the guests ignored.
Something good just to be here.

Well...

The lovely waitresses.
Are you serious?

Where is it?

You know what? On the house.

Where are you going?
To dance.

Wait, wait ...!
What are you doing?

Accompanied by a lady on the dance floor.
Can you dance?

I? No. I do not know how to?

I'm going to my drink in my hand, and
you're dancing around me to look good.

Well... I get it. Come on, look good.

I look like?
No, that's terrible.

That's all you got?
I do not.

Okay, your turn.

I promise I will not laugh... a lot.

Hey, where you going?

And assume that Cinderella's gone.

Hey dude, what's up?

How are you, Ricky?
Very good, as always. Here you are.

When I asked for money for the drinks?

Just promise me that you're dancing
with mother. Jason scares.

Check it out!

Look... Jesus!

This is awesome!
Let me see that I have.

20 thousand visitors off more than five hours.

I think this is cool? Mercury has
been working in the band diagram.

I will not assume that you
know when you do not speak?

The Jedi powers.
Yeah, right.

A much deeper connection between us.

Agyig brain... face to face.

Sean, you should think about the next dance.

I agree.
Take power ourselves.

Increase the vision.
What is the competition...

When I was not much older than
you, it was not even jutub.

You mean: Youtube, yes?
Please...

Look, Ricky. The first of 10 million 100
thousand dollars to get viewership.

Even if you win, the money
will not last forever.

I do it to learn the material. Introduction.

If we are already known,
then the juice is decided.

Exactly! - Yes!
First, get the money, right? - Yes!

Then the power!
So be it!

You know what comes next after the right, Pam?

The next dance?

Soon. Do not bother with this now.

Tonight we celebrate!
Yes!

It's early, Kate.
Come on, Sean, move!

10 more minutes, okay, honey?

Okay... just this once.

I was afraid of... if you feel
the rhythm, I can not stop.

There is a new step for you.
It's called a "motion ocean."

It's the ocean, and now comes the movement.

You can try it out. Ocean and motion.

Together.

Ocean and motion.

Ocean and motion.
â™ªI got you now!

<i>Bill Anderson, the real

Whip some eggs if you want.
Do not be. You'll have to go.

So what? Have you seen?

Oh, it was rated the best.
Mom, what are you talking about Sean?

The uncle stopped the traffic on
Ocean Drive street yesterday.

Sara, go brush your teeth.
Five minutes after we leave.

Cool...

Would you stop? I do not want
her to think you're doing good.

So what?

Again, there were in the news yesterday.

What do you do if arrested?
They will not catch it.

Why are you being like this?
Because you do not have much chance to win.

If you have one at all.

Why do not you go back to
school to learn the profession?

Come on! You never wanted
to do something else?

The Tesoka the flashmob professional dancer.

I talked to my friend, Jessica.

Take a look into it. A freight
forwarding company is working

and there is a management training program.

Should start from the bottom, but if you
faring, shall be paid in the evening school.

Please, think about it.
I do not think about it.

We're going to win the race!

And you can recognize us.

You have to...

Sara, come on!

Yeah... Let's hope, for now
just a cat meowing or.

I knew you did.

I came to Miami for one purpose.

Demon to transform the target of the
most popular restaurants in South Beach.

And that's just the beginning.

In the coming months, I want to build
a new hotel and residential colonies.

And then feelÃ©pÃ­teni largest hotel in Miami.

If I work hard, I'll be grateful.

Mr. Ryan, for example, the
University has been working for me.

And now CEO of the demons.

Open up already!

Young man, all employees were asked
to be here 20 minutes early.

Okay, dude, I'm sorry. I have
problems with the alarm.

I accept the apology, but
it does not work here.

What?
Do not bother staying on.

In this area, the inaccuracy
is not acceptable.

More than 1 year in melÃ³zom!
Call security to kikÃ­sÃ©rjÃ©k?

The trust has two faces.

If you do not meet the above requirement
does not owe anything in return.

Anderson The company's customers
expect quality and that I ask.

Thank you.
We thank you, Mr. Anderson.

Okay, I get to work.

How can you say that?
The paternal instinct to oppose.

I do not understand why.
Put yourself in my place.

As if rewarded to stay out of the university.

I went to college because you wanted it.

So it's all because of Winwood?

One of the best modern dance
group in the world, Dad!

You know what I think about it.

How many dancers will be successful? One
of the thousands? One in ten thousand?

Yes.
It is one thing to dance as a child,

and others, if you try to
make a career out of it.

Thanks for the support.

I want my eggs Benedict. Fruit yogurt you ask?

Yogurt is a small woman.

Hello.

My God! I'm so sorry!
It's okay.

Emily, most people give up everything

the chance that you do not want to accept.

If you work hard enough, could lead to a firm.

I do not understand your attitude...
I'll get another fruit juice.

Emily, I'm talking to you!
I heard that.

Make you a deal. Or you're a professional
dancer at the end of the summer,

or go back to Cleveland to work for me.

I used to want the same. Do you remember?

Emily and her father against the world.

What has happened?

We still want it, Dad.

More.

Just like if you wanted,
what I want for myself.

I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

What are you doing here?
I'm done with the job, and I heard the music.

My name is Sean. You Emily, are not you?

We met at the club. - I know.
â™ªDo you know?

It's weird. It did not seem, when...
Besides your father did.

My father can not be everything.

Sorry, but I'm angry.

By the way, great... the dance.
Thank you.

It was good. A bit boring.
What are you talking about? Killer dance well!

Not enough.

Why?

A trial. We have to prepare for a number.

I do not know.
Try it.

It's called Win Wood.
Olivia Brown from.

Yes, very cool. - Do you know the Win Wood in?
Yes... I danced.

And extraterrestrial technology
is, it's called internet.

Yes, I'm sorry.

Anyway, it does not matter.
Will not be successful,

I make a suggestion?
Of course.

Put into club music. That girl was not boring.

I can not do anything. There are rules.

Attempt to circumvent them.

What are you doing Friday night?

Why?
Neek want to show you something.

What is it?
Trust me.

Come Friday night at 8!

Thanks, but I prefer to do it alone.

I see.

Your father would not like it.

Um... get dressed up!

What a day, huh.
â™ªI wanted to talk to you about today morning.

I went out with him, but...
Oh, man...

You do not need it.

You'd be unemployed.

We're doing a few rallies, we were
differences and win the money.

Okay?
Yeah, all right.

Fine.

I think I realized that doing the next dance.

Are you ready?

I thought you did not even ask me, man.
â™ªPrepare the garage.

<i>Movements of Ocean Drive has a
large viewing figures on YouTube.</i>

But the next flashmob <i> somewhat complicated.</i>

So, there are two main entrances and exits

and a back, which leads to the street.

The van is waiting for us out there.
This escape route.

To put the dancers unnoticed?

In a word I'm saying, man: camouflage.

<i>Security guards are everywhere.</i>

Jennifer Gibgot <i> Director supervises them.</i>

This is a phenomenal show and I want to...
â™ª<i> What about the music?</i>

<i>I thought I could go to work with Penelope.</i>

The last gentleman of music was too loud.

So, be good, and no loud music.
â™ªNot loud music... I see.

<i>Sure many visitors will bring us.</i>

<i>That's right, the band will be
pushed onto the mark in the art.</i>

Thank you!

Thank you!
â™ªThanks to everyone for coming.

I can only imagine how
difficult it is to dance test.

Especially when I danced.

I understand that I am a freak.

But do not forget! If everybody could do it,

I would not be Winwood.
â™ªName the dancers

who had been invited to
be a student at Winwood.

At the end of the summer, each dancer
will dance on a selected number.

Then select a man and a woman who can join us.

And new students are:

Viera Williams, Josh Torres, Melba Watson

Mubi Shakira and Emily Anderson.

Thank you and congratulations!

Emily, where did you learn?

The Maxter at Breguet, New York.

A good technique is almost perfect.

Is absolutely no difference.

Honey, lack of originality,
so I suggest, perhaps more.

You have to do it, okay?

Thank you!

We have arrived!

What is this mystery?

It's pretty pathetic way of
cheating her out of the girls.

It's not a date. I promise.

Come, we must hurry! By
the way, you look great!

Still not a date.
You look good, too.

Why are we here?

I thought, I need some encouragement.

Wait!

<i>This time we took control of the

<i>Objects come to life,</i>

<i>Surprised the visitors last night.</i>

<i>The police investigation continues,
there are many unanswered questions.</i>

Of these, the two most pressing <i>: who
is this band and why are they doing?</i>

You have not spoken? Guests are
not kaveredhetnek the staff.

I want it.
I do not know what you're talking about. â™ªI want to join the band.

I can not talk about it here. Maybe
I can help you with tÃ¡ncodban.

But the band... not for you.
This is a weak excuse.

Hazardous what we do for you?

If you go to jail, your
father would be very angry.

You said that you have to break the rules.
Too much is at stake.

We have to win the race.
What kind of competition?

YouTube gives 100 thousand for
the first 10 million views held.

It would be great if bevennÃ©tek a dancer.

Sean! Guests waiting!
Immediately turn.

I have to go.

You need to make your way to Winwood.
â™ªAnd which is the only way I can do it,

If I take the risk and make
changes in my dancing.

The band would not agree. Especially
when you know who you are.

Who says you need to know?

Always a job, dude.
How you doing, bro?

What's going on?
I want you to meet someone.

Emily, she Eddy, co-founder of the band.
And my best friend.

Nice to meet you.
Hey!

What are you doing here?
Connect the following tÃ¡ncunkhoz.

Educated about the race
and what's up here. Help!

Sean, can I talk to you?

Dude, what the hell is this?

Fucking good dancer.
So what?

You got slammed so easily?

How do I know that sound?
I guarantee it.

No! Just trust in those who are here.

What's the problem? You told me that I
should have a girl in the choreography.

Worth a try. Plus a handy man.

Come on!

Can you make the next dance?

Yes, I think so.
All right.

Because you lead the dance.

You said that I am the dancing?
Yes, I do.

Yes Hello.

Come, meet the members.

Eddy our computer technician.

<i>Understands everything that is
computerized or computer language.</i>

<i>He is our eyes and ears.</i>

Penelope <i> the hottest DJ in South Beach.</i>

<i>He composed all the crazy mix of dances.</i>

He moved <i> everything.</i>

<i>Jason just returned from New York. He
was a member of the "Pirates", a team.</i>

<i>He deals with the effects. </ s></i>

Mercury <i> famous street artist.</i>

<i>No one ever heard him speak.</i>

You know, a picture is worth a thousand words.

Iris <i> there is a lot of shooting.</i>

<i>Wants to raise the artistic level of

<i>Adrian Sly and the leaders

<i>Other members from around the world to.</i>

<i>Every style of dance.</i>

<i>Bring it all together. The band's lair.</i>

<i>Wake people from everyday life,</i>

We'll hit you and <i> and where you least expect.</i>

When the band <i> speaks, everyone listens.</i>

I still change your mind.
No, you do not need.

Are you ready, are you?

911 Emergency <i>.</i>

What do you think? Quite inspiring?
I!

Thank you.

May I steal?
It's yours.

Can szalszÃ¡zni?

Do you think?
Okay, let's see whether you can keep up with.

Oh, it was good.

You did well.

Not bad.

I like it here.

Not exactly a luxury hotel.
No, that's right. You're lucky.

Lucky? â™ªlt would have been
growing up in such a place.

I grew up in hotels.

We look different, but are all the same.

A clean, sterile, temporary.

Here people really live.

It's beautiful.

I love it.
Want to see more?

It's your boat?
No, but I can take you for a ride.

When you bring up the band?
Eddy's idea of â€‹â€‹the band.

How long have you know each other?
Ever since I can eat.

We're practically brothers.

Ricky's parents went to the
restaurant every night.

Played with, which we knew.

Then my father left us.

My mother remarried. Since
then, the family's modest.

It was here, after mother left my father.

My father and I were inseparable.
And what happened?

Created their own ideas
that you wish to access.

It is very difficult to accept my views.

You should do what you want.
It's not that simple.

Why?
Not you, Sean!

I want to be like you. I do what I want.

To break the rules.
Like me?

Real life is. Eddy with what
we are invisible in the city.

Therefore, we started to
do the demonstrations.

This helps you to have a listen.

We exist. The city is ours.

Find embarrassing?
I do not. Not at all!

Hey, Ricky!

What has happened?

Ever heard of Global Properties
of the Anderson company?

Yes. Why?

That guy is Anderson doing some improvements.

Luxury hotels, fancy shops...

Buying the coast on this side of the river.

This is a bar, a house, a shop,
where your sister is working...

All is lost. Named "El Frente del Rio".

Can you believe it? This is the
same garbage, he fired me.

You have no right to come here
and take away everything.

You can not oppose that?
That's not my decision.

The space is rented, just like everyone else.

Many people here live on.

Now all burn. Everything!

Emily!

Where are you going?
Talk to my dad.

It can help you?
I do not know, but we must try.

We have to tell your friends to my father.
They deserve it.

I do not know. Eddy has
little to lose and control.

Ricky and I have not seen him like this.
Just pouring oil on the fire.

Can you tell me where you've been?

I went with a friend and was too late.

That is an unknown boy spend the night?

There was no ur.
Just do not repeat!

I have an appointment.

New investment in boot from Spring Garden?

Why do you ask?

My friend, Sean, lives there.
It's getting better!

In the dirt you spend the night?
No thanks!

Dad, you should see! The same
families living there for decades.

Every time I build something,
something must be destroyed.

Someone's house or business.
This is the price of progress.

The transaction is complete. Negotiating
with the city council next Thursday.

Should have given their blessing to it, at
the end of the month we start the work.

Please, do not do it!
Agree!

I will not say it, how to dance...

You do not say... it's the company management.

Five-minute break, girls.

Emily...

Where are you?
Here I am. Just...

You're not here!

When I look at you, I see a
leaf floating in the studio.

Take control, Emily!

From the beginning again!

Where have you been?

Emily has an idea for the next dance.

Just what was missing to come
mgmondja Cinderella and what to do.

The next dance would work. We
are looking at over 4 million.

And what if the size of the YouTube audience?

You know you can win the race, made money,

but it will not change anything. Believe me.

There are 4 million people who watch you,

but not fully disclose anything important.

I do not have it as long that you enjoy doing,

and not away with you if you break the law.

And what do you suggest?

Enough with the art showbÃ³l.
Getting into the art of protest!

The plans show a week in the local government.

The council must approve the start.

I think you should skip.
You want to break the meeting?

I'm in!
How do you know this?

The city council shall be public.

And the development of a
technology and the Internet.

Well said.

Think about it. Instead
of a hunt scene, we hear.

Okay, I'm listening. What's the plan?

More dancers need.

<i>Sit down, gentlemen.</i>

<i>Thank you for being here.</i>

We are excited about the show because.

Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Bob Cooper.
Cooper and Mackie from

One of the largest marketing
company EgyeÃ¼lt States.

<i>Bob agreed to come in person...</i>

Immediately <i> present a more detailed plan.</i>

First of all we would like to draw your
attention to our plans for coastal restoration.

Okay...

I think we should go...

I apologize. I do not know
whether this practice.

We find out what the problem is.

Then visszemegyÃ¼nk the meeting.

Nice tie.

What the hell is going on here, Trip?

What is the purpose of this?

I should fear this band?
I do not.

Only stupid kids.

Just some stupid kids have?

Yeah

<i>flashmob was designed to disrupt a meeting</i>

Yes! Motion of the ocean does.

We are grateful for it.

I do not know what to say... Thank you!
We are very grateful!

Have you seen the video with the kids...
Dance is a universal language.

8-10 million views! We are number one!

The community side of the band,
Anderson lost his support.

The Council's latest survey showed
that if you do not vote for,

Anderson does not approve the plan.

Thumbs up! That's right, Emily!

Do not hurry! Okay!

It takes shape.

I like it!

Do not worry, you can do the test.

I am grateful for the help.

Did he say anything to your father?
No, but I think it worked.

Bad it would be if he knew I was there.

I do not feel bad for having sabotaged
the expansion of your father?

Asserting that the terrible and greedy
father, stealing their neighborhood?

Yes, I feel guilty.

But as much as I love my father,
sure to find a different location.

Happy, believe me.

What is your relationship?
You have to go to a full-Ball.

Trip asked me to be his partner.

You think you can get closer to my father.

As you can imagine, that I refused.
'd Like you to come with me.

Of course, I'll be there. Just on the
other side of the table, tray in hand.

Even rehearsed?
I do not.

Only one?
I do not think I have the time.

Come on!
No!

Can I come in?
Yes.

To go to the dance?
Good.

After 2 days will be the final test.

Good luck!
Thank you.

Are you okay?
Yes.

I've had two difficult. I'm
glad that you're here for me.

Emily and her father, against the world!
Is it true?

Yep.

I'll let you sleep. Good night, my dear!

Good night, Dad!

I hope that it is important,
otherwise you have somebody veins.

Yo Eddy!
What's up?

What are you trying to show?

Where's Sean?
Check it out!

I found the recording prÃ³bÃ¡jukrÃ³l.

<i>Would be bad if he knew I was there.</i>

<i>Not feel bad for having

What the fuck?
Googled.

Emily Anderson. With his daughter.

It's crazy!
What?

Maybe we should call Sean. Explain what's up.

No! I have a better idea.

I think it will be better for everyone.

Here is my beautiful little girl, I'm sorry.
I'm glad you came.

Or too occupied dÃ¶ngetÃ©se the boss's daughter?

Emily!
You used me!

I swear, I did not know
what she wants Eddy.

Stop it! They can not
do anything without you!

Emily!
Fuck off!

Sean lied! You lied to us!

It's true. I lied, Eddy. I tried
to protect the girl you like.

They are timely.
Shut up!

Morons! You do not know when to stop.

You are all over the news.

We excluded.

It's impossible! Visit there.
I received an email from them.

They do not want their
names included in the mix.

Nonsense!
Anderson denounced.

We're doomed.

We both got a lesson today.

Hell! Apokolba you and go!

It's too late. We get there.

What did you think, what? I
thought his blessing upon you?

You and the princess lived happily ever after?

I can not believe that after
you have suffered together,

You choose the lying bitch for me.

I asked them not to tell who the father is.

I knew I was too stubborn to not care.

Perhaps much you think you are,

but he would not do this as you are.

I'll let you!
Let go of me, man.

and I'll call you back.</i>

I did not mean to offend you.

Forget it!

The plan was approved, and will soon begin.

Where's Sean?
In the morning he took his stuff.

No new posts <i>.</i>

Where do I put this box?
I.

Emily Anderson!

I thought you prepare a duet.

I changed my mind. No one will.

Emily!

Emily?

What are you doing here?

I need to know... Failed?

What are you going to do?
To meet my promise.

I'm going to work for my father.
Do not do this! Do not give up!

But you? When will the next flashmob?

The houses were demolished.

Right here.

This is anger among you, not good.

Yeah I know. I did not start.

But befejezhetnÃ©d. Just sift the fire.

I lied to him, Ricky.
You are young.

Have not met the right girl,
so you do not know what it is.

But one day you'll find him.

And when you find it, do not
lose hope, as your friend.

Go and fix it.

Please.

What are you spying on, man?

What is it?

Big mistake and there is no excuse.

It's just... I do not know.

I thought it was you and me
against the world we are.

I began to feel that losing you.
But never mind, it was stupid.

I'm sorry.

Not only is your fault.

You should not have to lie.

So, I got my best friend back?

I do not know. I hope you do not expect a ring?
Not at all.

I broke one of my teeth, crazy bastard.

From now on, only this
hundreds of times a fist.

Wait!

Hi, Sean!
What are you doing?

I'm sorry, bro!

MindÅ‘nk sorry.
Yes. The band is not the same without you.

The band and all, a good thing
we did something wrong.

Maybe there is way to fix this.

To get a chance.
What is.

To achieve our goal of being
the band lÃ©rtehoztuk.

To be heard.

Do not let it stick to a simple tournaments.

You have to give people to
make their voices heard.

The problem is that they need more sound.
Much more.

This will not be a problem. Many
people like to have more than lana.

That's right!
So you're dealing with.

5,6,7,8 ...!

Warning! Stop! 2 Step down here.

Again!

<i>Stand up!</i>

Will wonder if it works.

We need all the help possible.

Jason! What's up?
All right! Listen...

I am going to some big one in Miami.
I need some fireworks.

What do you think?
Good. What were you thinking?

Figyuzzatok!

Ã–teletes, right?

Imagine a mass of people who
are doing this more than once.

What about the costumes?
I know!

So, got the costumes?
Spoken!

You see, my friends, today is our day!

What a beautiful day it is in the area,

prosperity will soon enter a new era.

Thank you!

<i>Hard road led to this, it was a lot of talk...</i>

<i>- I'm glad you're here. -...
some misunderstanding.</i>

Soon we'll go back to Cleveland
and back leave this city.

<i>I am proud to have worked with
my dear friend Bill Anderson,</i>

and offer our cooperation as a symbol of...

...a shovel, which is...
â™ªWhat is happening?

I think it's broken. What about it?

Bastards!
What happened?

Ladies and gentlemen...
What the hell is this?

A few weeks ago I asked who this band.

The band we are. Miami gang.

And Miami is just as valuable as a culture.

If you destroy a culture, destroy the city.

There is something important to say.

Let us express ourselves in the way we do.

Why did not you do anything?

Yes

Oh, my God!

We did it!
Not yet.

There is something else.

Get back!

Come! Do not you think it's time
to fight for what you want?

Emily?

Bravo!
Come here!

Andy, my son! I am Robert Alexander "third".

But you can call me Moose.
Moose?

We saw clearly that this community has to say.

And we came to help, to tell.

Mr. Anderson?

We can not destroy the
quarter megakadÃ¡lyzoni...

We wanted to show you...
but what will odaveszni.

I'm sorry, Bill. The things
do not go as expected.

Right! Because the plan has changed!

Maybe find a way for you to build
on the area, not to destroy it.

What do you think?

Why Moose?

The question that should
be asked, why not, Moose?

I told you!

Sorry!
Not now, Bob!

I wanted to talk to her, not you.

Bob Cooper, owner of the advertising company,

I hired Mr. Anderson. No offense,

but the greatest of our clients as Nike.

Yes?
They are looking for something unique.

Something special for the new campaign.
The team would be your superior.

Are you ready to make the
world get to know the band?

What do you think?
What do you think??

Where do I sign?

Look what you did! Brought people together!

You can be vaalki who violate the rules.

I'm in!
