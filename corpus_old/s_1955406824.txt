(deep swishing)

(birds flapping)

(eerie dramatic music)

(water gushing)

(gears creaking)

All right, you boys.

I know you're both new so this may seem

a bit strange and
unfamiliar to ya at first.

Just gotta pace yourself, that's all.

That's the key.

Keep the sewage flowin'.

That's the idea.

Somethin' bad comes into the trap,

it's our job to fish it out.

Fish it out, dump it in the bins.

That's it.

Basic.

Hey, five bucks.

Save it for your retirement.

Aw, that's nothin'.

I once fished a kilo of
heroin out of the trap.

Turned it over to the police, of course.

Yeah, find all sorts of stuff.

Diamond rings and necklaces.

Wanna know a little secret?

My Lizzie's engagement ring?

Got it right here.

Yes, sir.


I once fished a woman's hand out

with her fingerprints cut off.

And embryos.

Embryos?

[Man] You know, don't want it around.

Flush it down.

Bullshit.

Oh, we get 'em.

Four or five a year.

Sometimes like they ain't got
no arms and legs and shit.

You know, deformed.

Sometimes we get things don't rightly know

what the hell they are.

I reckon I've seen just about everything

that can come out of a sewer pipe.

Aw.

What?

What the hell is this?

(dramatic music)

[Man] Come on, Martin.

What is it?

Eh, it's just one of them thangs.

Holy shit.

Man.

(flesh squishing)

[Man] So what is it?

Well, like I said.

It's a, one of them thangs.

What do we do with it?

I'll take care of it.

That's my responsibility
as head of the shift,

so you two can relax.

Everything's under my control.

(suspenseful music)

Well, that's the whole point, George.

I knew you had bicephalic fetus.

I sold it to you.

That's why I know that
two-headed darling's a boy.

This one I got now is a girl.

You'll have a matched set.

(muffled speaking)

Well now I think we're
talking somewhere along

the lines of $12,500
dollars with free delivery.

(muffled speaking)

Yes, George.

(muffled speaking)

Honey, honey, I know the two-headed babies

ain't as rare as they once were,

but you can't exactly pick
one up at Sears, now can you?


(phone ringing)

International Medical Specimens, Inc.

Elvina speaking.

(muffles speaking)

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Okay, now.

Hold on.

I'll see if Ms. Yost is free.


(muffled speaking)



Hi, hello?

Um, Ms. Yost, she's like on
another call sort of thing.

Do you think you can hold?

Yeah, yeah, I can hold.

[Elvina] Okay, sweetie.

Honey, honey I gotta tell you.

When I first looked into
those two pairs of baby blues

peeking out at me from that
bottle of denatured alcohol,

I thought of you.

But you know, your Belinda doesn't believe

in the hard sell.

I mean, you ain't interested.

I pick up the phone,

this little two-headed angel's gonna be

flying to somebody else.

[George] All right, fine, fine.

All right, so what should I do?

What do you want me to do?

Come down there with the cash?

Georgy boy.

This is a no deposit, no
return kind of business.

Want to come on down, take a look?

[George] Yeah (muffled speech).

That's fine.

You like the little angel,
you give me a certified check.

Cash and carry.

(muffled speaking)

Well, I look forward to seeing you, too.

Right.

[George] All right, have fun.

Yes, baby, you got it.

You are so good.


Elvina, was that guy from
the sewer still on hold?

Ah, well, he's still on the line,

but I can't, um--

[Ms. Yost] Fine, fine, fine.

I think the hold thing ain't workin'.

Nevermind.

Martin, angel.

Long time no hear.

Where have you been hiding yourself?

[Martin] Well, you know,
I've been working in the sewer.

Uh-huh.

[Martin] But I found this
thing and I'm interested in it.

It's kind of like--

Mmm-hmm.

[Martin] It's got two eyes, two mouths.

Say that again.

[Martin] It's got two
mouths, two ears, two eyes.

[Ms. Yost] No, no, no.

Just describe it.

(muffled speaking)

Yeah.

[Martin] It's got two heads.

Yeah.

(muffled speaking)

I'll be right down.

Elvina, call Mr. Lazar.

Tell him may have something
really hot coming in.

Tell him to meet me
down in cold storage in,

oh shoot, an hour.

Well, what about Dr. Lorca?

I mean, I've got, I mean I
thought we was supposed to--

Honey, if I wanted a
thinking receptionist

you'd be working at Burger King, okay?

Now pick up the phone and call Mr. Lazar.

I've gotta run.

Well, can I take...

(door slamming)

lunch?


(phone beeping)

Hello? Dr. Lorca?

Um, this is Elvina Shaw from--

[Dr. Lorca] How are you?

Well, you know, you know how
you told me to call you if--

(muffled speaking)

Why yes she is.

Just like you suspected, I bet.

Uh-huh, Mr. Lazar.

That's right.

Uh-huh.

Sure, sure.

As soon as I find somethin' out.

Uh-huh.

Well, thank you.

Sheila, this world is
full of dishonest people.

Due tell, Doc.

I have paid this
woman, this Belinda Yost,

a costly retainer for years to guarantee

that I will have the first opportunity

to buy her unusual specimens.

Don't have to tell me.

I write the checks.

And now she has gone behind my back.

And to whom do you think?

Smithsonian?

Oh-ho, that would be bad enough.

But she's sneaking behind
my back with that gauche,

undiscriminating collector
of medical garbage.

Napoleon Lazar.

How can I continue to do business
with this dishonest woman?

Doc, you want my opinion?

Perhaps.

You say the world is
full of dishonest people.

I say if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

[Man] So, has Ms.
Yost said anything more

about the specimens?

[Elvina] Um, nope.

[Man] Nope.

Ah, well.

Well, Ms. Yost.

The, the Napoleon.

Just hold on one sec and I
want to show you something

that'll knock your socks off.

When I leave in the
middle of a board meeting,

I expect to have my socks knocked.

Have I ever disappointed you?

Occasionally.

Oh, now, don't be like that.

Well, Marty boy, have I made you happy?

You sure have.

If I find anything else--

You just give me a call.

Elvina, why don't you show Martin on out.

Um, yeah, sure.

Come on.

And close the door on your way out.

Sir, you're about to spend
a huge quantity of money.

Well, it's always good
to know these things.

In fact, I'm gonna tell you
exactly what you're gonna do.

In about 60 seconds you're gonna pick up

your portable phone and
you're gonna call someone,

and you're gonna have them deliver to me

a certified check for $650,000 dollars.

How eccentric of me.

In addition, you're
gonna sign some documents

I got tucked in here somewhere.

Said documents constituting
a guarantee to purchase

no less than $250,000
dollars of medical specimens

from me per year for the next 10 years.

How generous of me.

I give you a check,

I agree to purchase a
quarter of a million dollars

of your medical leftovers?

Per year for the next 10 years.

Per year for the next 10 years.


My goodness.

Whatever has come over me?

Napoleon, you're sweet,

but I can see right through you into

the other side, my friend.

I got three drunks, two
junkies, and six fat people

in my immediate family alone.

I know when someone's hooked on something.

I know all the signs.

I just name my price
and I won't negotiate.

If the air's too thin for you,

then there's no reason
for me to open this box.

I won't get more from
anybody else, I know that.

But this is what I want.

And if you won't give it to me,

then I'll take less from Lorca.

Don't mention that medical fraud,

that cadaverous Castilian dilettante.

Honey, you're either in
the game or you're not.

Open the box.

(dramatic music)

May I?

Please.

It's real, all right.

Don't think I would've
bought it otherwise.

It ain't no Piltdown, baby.

(dramatic music)

(phone dialing)

Alfonse, a 10, please.

You are to go to Mr.
Willitson at our special bank.

You are to have him
draft a certified check

for $650,000 dollars made
out to Ms. Belinda Yost.

That's right.

Repeat please.

[Alfonse] Ah, $650,000
dollars to Belinda Yost.

That is correct.

You are then to hand carry
that check to me here

at International Medical Specimens.

Estimated time, please?

Make it snappy, nappy.

[Alfonse] I think about two hours.

Thank you.

That will be acceptable.

And Alfonse, don't be late.

You'll have your check within two hours.

Honey, you just made
me a very happy girl.

The documents, please.

(suspenseful music)

[Sheila] Yeah, Doc?

The little pigeon is on his way.

[Woman] Roger Wilco.

Over and out.

(suspenseful music)

What? What?

This is my private road.

Oh.

Yes, yes.

Are you alive?

Hmm?

You know, you shouldn't be here.

Hey, you.

Don't move, little froggy.

Ah, what is this?

It ain't Candid Camera.

Open the door.

You try anything funny,

I'll fill you with so
many holes people will be

able to read through ya.

My wallet is in my inside pocket.

Move.

Shut up.

Up against that tree.

[Napoleon] Just what
do you plan on doing?

[Sheila] Not answering stupid questions.

Move!

[Mr. Lazar] Hey, what are you doing

walking around like that?

With no top on?

I'm free.

I'm proud.

I'm woman.

Now wrap your arms around that tree.

You realize, of course, you're
gonna go to jail for this.

I know.

That's why I keep comin'
back to a life of crime.

It's 'cause I like being in jail.

Trouble is they keep letting me out.

Think I'd get a longer
sentence with murder?

How amusing.

I happen to have an
excellent sense of humor.

Sit tight for me.

Wait, there's nothing of value in there.

Where you goin'?

The beach?

It's um, it's a biological specimen.

It's, it's dangerous, contagious.

Wow, it's cool.

Bet this'll be a real
ice breaker at parties.

No, no, no, wait.

You can take anything else.

Take the car.

[Sheila] I already got a car.

[Napoleon] Listen, listen.

I'll give you more money.

[Sheila] What are you gonna do?

Write me a check?

See you around, froggy.

No, no, no, wait.

Come back, please.

Please.

Come back, you thief.

Please.

You ho.

I'll kill you.

I'll kill you!

Come back!

Come back!

(dramatic organ music)

It's magnificent.

I've never seen anything like it.

No one has.

There never has been anything like this.

Never.

It's, it's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

Quickly, one of the large jars.

Can do.

(dramatic music)

There you are, my treasure.

This is your new home.

Here you will be appreciated, loved.

(kiss smacking)

Doc, you two want to be left alone?

Yes, yes, I think we do.

I won't be having dinner tonight, I think.

Well, I will.

See you later, Doc.

Sheila?

Don't forget the preservative.

Can do.

And Sheila, thank you so much for this.

My pleasure, Doc.

I always knew I'd make
a great highway robber.

I'm going to go take care of the car.

(eerie dramatic music)

[Recording] Warning.

Acid bath.

Please stand clear.

Three, two, one, bye.

(liquid bubbling)

(eerie dramatic music)

Right, okay.

Let me just see if I can get
this straight in my head.

There were these guys who
sell freaks in bottles,

and you're like this Class A, 
big time freak collector.

Biological oddities.

Right.

And like your job is sellin'
the freaks in the bottles

that this guy buys.

That's right.

You're like the chief freak broker

in this freak collecting underground.

Remember the skeleton
of the Elephant Man?

Michael Jackson wanted to buy it?

He didn't get it.

He didn't come to me.

Yeah.

Now my problem is you
sell this really hot shit

freak to him for some undisclosed sum,

and somebody rips it off at gunpoint.

And keeps me handcuffed to
a tree for the next 14 hours.

So why don't you go the police?

Well.

The thing is, Mr. Kantor,

although what we do is
not considered illegal,

it has a, oh, what's the word?

Creepy?

Unsavory reputation.

The legal situation is,
oh, a rather gray area.

And we want to keep it gray.

That's no police.

We know where my specimen is.

We can't be sure.

Oh, I can be sure.

It was stolen by one of the most depraved,

immoral and covetous creatures
on the face of the earth.

Dr. Emilio Lorca.

I take it he has an
interest in this stuff?

I'm a serious collector.

Lorca is a dabbler, a dilettante.

So how did this Lorca guy
know that you had this goober?

I would very much
like to know the answer

to that question myself.

[Mr. Kantor] Could your
phone in your office be bugged?

I check my offices bi-monthly.

This is a business that
requires discretion,

and the last time was only two days ago.

Your receptionist?

My receptionist is a performing
chimp in human disguise.

She's too stupid to be dishonest.

Ms. Yost, I have yet to
meet a person that's stupid.

Is she the cupcake out
in the waiting room?

Yeah, she's the cupcake.

Elvina.

Send her in.

Hi, Elvina.

Hi, there.

You know what's goin' on here?

Um, well.

Take your time.

Ye, yeah.

Yeah, you do.


Yeah.

Okay, now.

Listen carefully.

Dr. Lorca, he was arrested earlier today.

He told the police that
you helped him steal

the freak from Mr. Lazar here.

That fucker!

He told the police that you were the one

who actually stuck the
gun in Mr. Lazar's face

and left him handcuffed to a tree.

Nuh-uh.

Not me.

All I did was I...

He said the whole thing was your idea.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

I'm sorry, baby, but it
looks like jail for you.

Doc's a respected man.

You're not.

He's cuttin' a deal right now.

You know, it would go a lot
easier for you with the judge

if you'd just confess.

No, no I swear on my honor.

Cross my heart, hope to die.

All I did was just tell
him about the specimen.

I didn't know nothin' else.

And I put up with your
typing for three years

'cause I thought you were too stupid to

stab me in the back.

You're fired.

You're fired from everywhere.

You're fired from the fucking universe.

Huh?

The police don't know
anything about Dr. Lorca.

I lied to you.

Yeah?


Yeah!

Well, well, I lied to you, too.

(slap smacking)

Ow!

You ungrateful little poodle dog.

Well, it was all your fault.

You broke your word to Dr. Lorca.

He was supposed to have first dibs.

And what are you?

Defender of the fucking public morals?

Oh, you're an evil, corrupt person.

She takes drugs.

She doesn't wear any panties.

She, she, she has sex in her
office with all these men

all on her desk.

You ungrateful little poodle dog!


[Mr. Kantor] Ladies, ladies.

[Elvina] Oh, get off of me!

Ladies.

Ah!

Fucking ladies, knock it off!

Knock it off!


Ms. Yost, hey, Ms. Yost.

Normally I'm all in for a good cat fight,

but seeing how's you are
paying me $160 dollars

an hour for my time,

you might want to
consider calling this one

a draw for right now.

[Elvina] Well, I think
I'm gonna leave now.

No, actually I think you're gonna stay.

'Cause even though they
haven't caught Dr. Lorca yet,

it's still a possibility.

And that makes you an
accessory before the fact.

I'm a what?

It means when you called Dr. Lorca

and told him about the goober,

you helped him to steal
it in the eyes of the law.

Nuh-uh.

No, uh-huh.

So if you want to stay out of the clutches

of the highly immoral and sexually diverse

females at county jail,

your full-time job from now until I say so

is getting back the aforementioned freak.

You understand?


Look, do what I say, you stay out of jail.

Got it?

Yeah.

So, you see?

My suspicions were firmly grounded.

That intellectual fraud Lorca is probably

pawing my specimens right now with his

thick, clumsy fingers.

Touching it, probing it, violating it.

Inserting instruments
into the most private--

We get the idea, nappy.

So what do we do now?

Simple.

You call up Dr. Lorca
and you tell him you need

to talk to him about a new specimen.

Something he's sure to be interested in.

But you need to come over
and see him in person.

Now you don't want to let
on that you suspect him.

He'll even know that Mr.
Lazar here got robbed.

Make it convincing.

Make him want to invite you over.

That'll be as hard as
force-feeding chocolate cake

to a fat boy.

Then what?

All four of us take a
little ride over to Lorca's

and get back your goober.

Aren't you glad you
installed the closed-circuit

camera like I told you?

Yes, you're very clever, indeed.

You see?

Lazar is with him, as you expected.

But who is the other man?

[Sheila] Muscle, I'll bet.

Should I tell them to get lost?

No, that might drive them to the police.

They have no proof.

I'll see them in the parlor.

Everything is under control.

(dramatic music)

(glass breaking)

[Mr. Kantor] It's quite a
little castle you got here, Doc.

[Mr. Lorca] Yes, it
originally stood on the Rhine.

I had it torn down and reassembled here

with modern conveniences.

[Mr. Kantor] What do you
keep in all these rooms?

[Ms. Yost] Maybe we
should take a little tour

of your castle.

[Mr. Lorca] Really?

With or without my permission?

[Mr. Kantor] Ah, come on, Doc.

You're too smart to play dumb.

You see the cast of characters here.

You know what's goin' on.

Of course.

I admit, I spoke to your receptionist.

You and I had an arrangement, Ms. Yost.

I had the right to assure myself that that

arrangement was being honored,

which it was not.

Did you have the right to
send your vixen to waylay me?

I never saw you before
in my life, froggy.

Slut.

You cheap slut.

Hey, now slut I don't mind.

But I'm a costly slut.

Deal with it.

Ribbit.

Hey, hey, now settle down.

Settle down.

Do you mind?

The fact that Ms. Shaw
spoke to me is not evidence

that I committed any crime.

Certainly not evidence that you could take

to the police.

Certainly not evidence that would get you

a search warrant.

We don't want to go to the police

unless you force us to.

Then of course, we will.

But then maybe nobody gets the goober.

You go to jail,

and you could lose your entire collection.

Even if I were to believe that you would

go to the police, go to
the police with what?

At which point Dr. Lorca then told me

that he meant to steal the
specimen from Mr. Lazar

and that further he intended to employ

his female assistant whose name is Sheila

in furtherance of his plans.

Well, shoot.

I don't want to go to jail.

There are lesbians there.

I always thought that
was one of the advantages.

So you see, Dr. Lorca,

if I don't get it, no one will have it.

Ms. Yost, I am prepared
to match whatever

Mr. Lazar offered you, to the penny.

Well, Dr. Lorca, you must
understand that it really--

It's not up to her.

The specimen is my property.

She cannot sell what
is not hers to sell.

I had the right of first
refusal on any specimen.

A right for which I paid.

Gentlemen, that's a matter
for the courts to decide.

Don't be childish, my little Emilio.

You know, I always find it amusing.

A man like you inherits what?

$50 million dollars?

And starts to think he's really wealthy.

Well, I'm afraid that
you're playing all together

outside your league.

Reconcile yourself.

Some things are simply
too rich for your blood.

I am a serious committed collector.

Not some amateur.

I, sir, am a gourmet of the unusual.

You are nothing more than a gourmand.

I have the most complete collection of--

Of biological trash.

You come here barking at
my door like a mongrel.

Very well.

I challenge you.

Even a man who putters
through life in a creaky

succession of little
lime-green Honda Civics

knows the superiority of the Rolls Royce

when he sees it with his own eyes.

I will show you my specimens.

If you can claim in good conscience that

a single specimen of yours surpasses one

of my own in perfection,

then I am prepared to assure you that your

missing specimen will be returned.

If not, then you will
disappear from my life forever

and I will hear from you
and your cohorts no more.

And matters stand as they are.

Do you accept my challenge?

Gladly.

(dramatic music)

So what's with all this
table-sittin' stuff anyway?

It's just part of my
incredibly cute persona.

Gotta admit, you are pretty cute.

With the vest and the hot pants and stuff.

You know, most women would
be a bit uncomfortable

seeing company dressed like that,

but you pull it off nicely.

Thank you.

So what's with you and the Doc, anyway?

You were like raised
by wolves or somethin'

and he found and educated ya?

No, I answered an ad
in the Sunday Herald.

Doc was looking for a personal assistant.

You know, someone to clean the castle,

take care of his
specimens, keep his books,

write his checks.

And he hired you?

I must say, it worked out rather nicely

for the both of us.

Well, I have to admit,

there aren't many places
in this big, wide world

for someone as eccentric
and potentially dangerous

as myself fits in.

I can't argue with that.

I mean, that look would definitely not fly

for say like a dental hygienist.

Man, these little bitty
sandwiches are good.

What's in there?

Salmon?

Salmon pate and watercress.

I made the pate myself.

[Ms. Yost] Well, I'm
glad to see you're enjoying

your little sandwiches at $160
dollars an hour, Mr. Kantor.

I look to serve, Ms. Yost,

but my services are no longer required.

[Ms. Yost] I want you to know
who the hell is keeping you.

So where are we at, Doc?

Where are we at, you ask.

Well, I am here sampling some of Sheila's

delicious pate and watercress sandwiches.

He's so sweet.

You, Mr. Kantor, and Miss Elvina Shaw

are cooling your collective heels.

Sheila is being her usual charming self.

And Mr. Lazar is in my
study having his soul

slowly and inexorably
crushed in a hydraulic press.


(dramatic music)

This planarian.

This planarian.

It's five times larger than
any specimen known to science.

Oh, and the condition.

I can count the spines
on the anterior palps.

My collection, my life, a sham.

You're inhuman.

Then you admit defeat.

Yes.

No, that was only part of your collection.

What about the human specimens, hmm?

And you think I would
have lower standards

for our own species than for flatworms?

Oh, no talk.

Just show me.

Very well.

Right this way, please.

Follow me.

What?

Me, too?

By all means, especially you, my dear.

Uh! My babies!

They're gone!

Where are they?

Arrrhh!


Candella, candella, candella.

What's all this fighting about?

Emilio.

Emilio, let go of
Napoleon's ear right now.

Can we act civilized, please?

Are you listening to me?

Don't just stand there.

Stop them!

What for?

The Doc's winning.

Kantor, do you mind?

Ah hum, excuse me.

Mr. Lazar, you roll Doc Lorca over on top.


All right, Doc.

Let Napoleon down or I
start breaking some fingers.

Now!


Now can we all settle down here?

I swear to God, you two.

Make me ashamed to be
in this line of work.

You'll never get away with this.

Neither will you.

Where are my babies?

What have you done with them?

I don't know what you're talking about.

[Mr. Lorca] Liar!

You were in the study alone.

No one else could've touched them.

Quite down, you two.

Behave yourselves.

Listen, you were only out
of the study for a minute.

How could he have found this place,

hidden the goobers,

and got back out in that length of time.

I don't know.

Perhaps Mr. Lazar can answer
that question himself.

And look, there's alcohol
splattered all over the place,

and there is none on Mr. Lazar.

[Ms. Yost] Look on the floor.

It's just splatters.

No, no, no, no, look.

(suspenseful music)

Ah.

Nothing inside.

And just what are you suggesting?

That my specimens broke
out of their bottles

and climbed through the wall vent?

No, this is all together too conveniently

theatrical a display for my tastes.

I want my babies back and none of you

are leaving here until I get them.

(dramatic music)

(specimens gurgling)

(specimen murmuring)

You knew your pitiful
collection of human oddities

could never match mine.

So you staged this absurdity.

You intended this all along.

Well, you Castilian
swine, the deal is off.

I want my specimen back.

Wait a sec, wait a sec, wait a sec.

You think you can hide behind your lies

or this buffoon.

[Mr. Kantor] Hey now, hold on.

You caught me by surprise.

I will never let that happen again.

I said wait a second.

I don't care what any of you says.

This is just not normal.

Yeah boy, there's
today's understatement.

[Mr. Lorca] That's enough.

I will have my babies back.

Sheila, seal the castle.


What did you just do?

Just listen.

(shutters slamming)

(specimen murmuring)

(dramatic music)


This is some major fucked up shit.

[Ms. Yost] Ah, you noticed.

Good, I'm glad I'm
getting my money's worth.

[Mr. Kantor] I should
be charging you hazard pay

for like psychological trauma.

[Sheila] Aren't you glad you installed

the case-hardened steel
shutters like I told you?

I believe the original intention was

to keep people out, not in.

Works both ways.

Enough of this nonsense.

Open the doors.

Emilio, I am very disappointed in you.

[Mr. Lorca] Really?

Well, the disappointment is mutual.

Now listen carefully, everyone.

No one is leaving here until
my specimens are returned.

What? Me, too?

Oh, no.

You can go.

Oh, thank God.

So now how do I get out of here if--

She was being sarcastic, you moron.

Huh?

Well that's not very funny.

Stealing is one thing,

but kidnapping is something
all together different.

And assault and battery.

I shouldn't have to point
out that we outnumber you.

Plus, Mr. Kantor is armed.

Uh, no, I'm not.

What?

I don't carry a gun.

I don't even own one.

$160 dollars an hour
and you don't have a gun?

Who the hell do I look like?

Mannix?

You want a bodyguard, get a bodyguard.

You pay me for my skills and investigator,

my experience and my mental prowess.

Oh, Christ.

Well, even though Mr.
Kantor doesn't have a gun,

he's clearly a match for
the both of you physically.

You can fight, can't you?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Plus, with the four of us,

we outnumber you four to two.

Actually it's 11 to four.

What?

Me, the Doc, and nine
silly little millimeters.

As in nine millimeter
semi-automatic shoots

a clip of 20 slugs in half a second.

Aren't you glad I had you buy it for me?

Indeed, I am.

Please, everyone.

Sit down.

[Elvina] What, me too?

[All] Yes!

[Elvina] All right, all right.

Now, I am not, despite recent events,

an unreasonable person.

However, let me make it perfectly clear

that if my specimens
are not returned to me

and in perfect condition,

none of you are going to
get out of here alive.

And rest assured,

if they have been harmed in any way,

whatever you have done to
them, I will do to you.

I'm glad you're not being unreasonable.

Mr. Kantor, Mr. Kantor.

Every man has an overriding passion.

A thing for which he will do anything.

A thing for which he will kill.

For men like me, even like Mr. Lazar,

it's the pursuit of
biologically unique oddities.

For Ms. Yost, it's money.

For the ineluctable Ms. Shaw, who can say.

Bingo, perhaps.

Huh?

Enough, please.

Now, my dear Sheila is
going to take you upstairs

to a little room we have.

More of a storage closet, actually.

You will be locked in.

Then we will search this house.

If we find my babies in good condition,

I will be inclined toward leniency.

Otherwise.

Now before we drag this whole thing out,

does someone perhaps
have something to say?

Yeah.

I think all of ya, inclusive,
are off to see the Wizard.

First of all, there's no way any of us

could've pinched your little goobers.

Second of all, even if we did, who cares?

Third, the whole freak thing?

The buying, the selling, the trading?

It's weird.

Fucked up.

So why don't we just go home.

You two guys can get yourself a life.

Collect stamps, join the Y, 
go into local politics,

go on a date, somethin'.

[Ms. Yost] Well that
was pretty pathetic.

[Elvina] What, me too?

[All] Yes!

All right.

Everybody's yelling at me.

You try and do the right thing.

You try to help somebody out
and this is what happens?

[Sheila] Come on, pigeons.

This way to the coop.

Oh, don't be so gloomy.

It's the Van Gogh look.

It's probably already infected.

Ms. Yost--

Look, we're all adults here.

Don't be laying no grief on me.

I gotta pee.

Don't let us stop you.

What? What?

In front of everybody?

That, that's gross!

Pfff, pfff.

Hey, knock it off!

Hey, baby.

You want to come up and
try this for awhile?

You don't like it?

Move.

Ah, talk about a dog shit day.

Goes to show ya, you work for squirrels,

you end up nuts.

All right, pass me up something heavy.

How much do you weigh, Elvina?

Huh?

Hey, knock it off.

My arms are gettin' tired.

Excuse me.


(plaster and wood cracking)

All right, stand clear.

(plaster and wood cracking)


Well, sure knew how
to build 'em back then.

Well, what are we gonna do now?

Damn.

(eerie dramatic music)

(specimen banging)

What the hell's that banging sound?

(specimen murmuring)

(specimen banging)

(specimen murmuring)


Hey, hey.

[Ms. Yost] What? What is it?

Hey, listen.

[Mr. Lazar] Where is it coming from?

It's the other side of this wall.


(specimen murmuring)

(specimen banging)

[Ms. Yost] Who could it be?

More of Lorca's prisoners, no doubt.

He may have dozens for all we know.

Well there's a comforting thought.



(specimen murmuring)

(specimen banging)

I don't suppose anybody
here knows Morse Code?

Unless it's a telegraph
operator on the other side

of the wall it really doesn't matter much

now does it?

I guess not.

Hey, other side of the wall?

Can you hear me?

Knock twice if you can hear me.

(specimen knocking)

Are you prisoners, too?

Knock twice if you are.

(specimen knocking)

Hey, so are we.

We're locked in this closet.

Are you locked in, too?

Knock twice if you are.

(specimen murmuring)

Can you get out of your room?

(specimen murmuring)

(specimen knocking)

If you can hear you,
why is he knocking at all?

Why doesn't he just answer?

Maybe he's a deaf mute.

Elvina, if he were deaf, how
could he hear the questions?

Well, maybe he, I don't know.

Right, clear out of my way.

All right, you out there.

We're locked in this closet,

and as you probably know,

the entire freaking castle is sealed up

tighter than a locked jaw.

It don't look too good
for us and it probably

don't look too good for you, either.

You help us, we'll help you.

What do you say?

(specimen knocking)

All right, can you get
out of wherever you're at?


All right, baby.

This is the $64,000 dollar question now.

Can you unlock this door and get us out?

Does that mean you can't?

(specimen murmuring)

Am I boring you?

[Mr. Kantor] Listen.

Hey, are you out there or not?

(specimen knocking)

Honey, honey, can you unlock
this door and get us out?

(specimen murmuring)

How's it coming?

What the hell?

Doe la the open?

You know what?

I bet it's a kid.

Maybe a little kid.

I can't make head nor tails of that.

It says door locked.

How open?

Listen up.

You need to get a crowbar.

It's a metal bar with
an edge to slip between

the door and the jamb.

You understand?


How many of you are out there?


What the hell?

Four of them?

(loud rattling and banging)

My babies.

It makes no sense.

None of them could've gotten
upstairs without being seen

unless someone would have
had to walk through this room

in order to reach the rest of the house.

Where could they be?

Unless, unless he put them
in the acid bath after all.

Perhaps his over-inflated
ego couldn't accept

utter defeat at my hands.

Perhaps my babies...

Doc, can I give you some advice?

Yes, yes.

Someone upstairs in
that closet has to have

a pretty good idea what
happened to your babies.

Let's motivate them.

Yes, and we'll start with Lazar.

I think they've got it.

Do you have it?

Do you have the crowbar?

Okay, stand back.

(door creaking)

That's it.

It's coming!

Keep it up!

I'll pay you a $100,000
dollars if you can

get me out of this house.

(door creaking)

(specimen murmuring)

(specimen grunting)

(door creaking)

Uh, uh.

It's, it's magnificent.

Look, my specimen.

My specimen.

It's alive.

[Mr. Kantor] You know,
suddenly this closet

doesn't seem so bad.

[Mr. Lazar] Do you
think they're dangerous?

[Mr. Kantor] I think
that would be numbered

among the possibilities, yes.

Ms. Yost, I've got to have them.

What?

Listen to me, all of you.

I'll give you a million dollars each

if you help me catch them
and get them out of here.

Are your brains fried?

What are you talkin' about?

[Elvina] I'll do it.

What?

For a million dollars?

I'll help.

Hey, I gotta look to the future.

I mean, since I'm unemployed.

I'm in.

For two million.

What?

Hey, if she's getting a million,

I'm worth at least two.

Very well. Done.

I take it you're sitting
this one out, Mr. Kantor?

Can we all hold on a second here?

Hasn't anybody noticed anything strange?

[Elvina] Like what?

Like the fact that these
freaks are like alive?

I mean, that's a little bit odd.

Even for you.

You guys are all Dr.
Lorca's freaks, right?

You were all pickled in bottles, dead?

I mean, somebody correct
me if I'm wrong here,

but this is not normal.

These guys no longer
fall into the category

of being like biological oddities.

Of course I understand that.

They are unique biological oddities.

(specimen murmuring)

My babies!

You're, you're alive.

Get one of those blankets.

No, no gun.

We can't risk injuring them.

Doc, this is really not normal.

[Mr. Kantor] That's what I said.

Get away from them, Lorca.

They're coming with me.

Really?

And where do you think you're going?

I'm gonna give them the
home that they deserve.

Gourmet food, sophisticated entertainment,

the finest education, a gymnasium.

Anything, anything you want.

Don't listen to him.

Who kept you safe in your bottles?

Who tended you?

Who loved you?

Don't listen to that man.

To him you'll never be more than another

notch in his belt.

Oh, don't believe him.

All he wants to do is
put you on a pedestal.

I, I respect you.

Wow, this is really weird.

I want to help you
develop your full potential.

(specimen whimpering)

Now see what you've done?

You've upset him.

Calm down, my baby.

My little baby.

I've upset him?

It was you--

Ah, hell.

I'm gonna throw the blanket.

(specimen screaming)

Sometimes it just takes a woman to--

My babies.


My jewels!

My ass!

Ah, God damn it!

(specimen squealing)


[Sheila] I'll get 'em!

Stop! Stop!


[Both] Don't hurt them!

I'm doin' my best, Doc.


Get your hands off of him.

It's your attendant
that's doing him harm.

Stop it. Stop it.

You're hurting him.


You see?

He knows who loves him.

(gun firing)

Get back!

Run! Run!

(gun firing)


(specimen murmuring)


Are you okay?

Sure, why not?

No reason.

No reason at all.

Is there any other way
in or out of this place?

No, not with the windows sealed.

Damn.

(specimen murmuring)

(door creaking)

Oh, crowbar.

[Sheila] Don't worry.

Deadbolt runs from side to side

through the ceiling and the floor.

He's not prying it open.

I guess the Doc believes in security

when he's sleepin'.

Not really, but I do.

This is my room.

[Mr. Kantor] Ah, nice room.

Very tasteful.

[Sheila] Well, I'm a
very tasteful person.

(door creaking)

(specimen grunting)

I guess they've quit for now.

(dramatic organ music)

(eerie dramatic music)

[Ms. Yost] Ah, ah, ah, ah.

Mmm, mmm, mmm.

I must confess.

I'm finding this process--

[Ms. Yost] Ah.

Rather stimulating.

Yeah, nappy?

Uh.

Well, I gotta tell you,

normally having my ass admired by some guy

who's richer than God would get my juices

flowing lickety split,

but to be perfectly honest, I'm just, oh,

not in the mood.

Just as well, I suppose.

The atmosphere is hardly conducive.

And of course we need to
talk about my specimens.

Honey, as things
stand now it's more like

we're their specimens,
if you catch my drift.

Oh.

Well, the first cause of
action is immobilize Lorca

and that dangerous assistant.

Then we scour the house,

and when we find the specimens,

I will convince them to come with us.

Or if necessary, take them by force.

Ah!

I see you got this all planned out.

[Mr. Lazar] For their
own good, of course.

Of course.

And of course, your
assistance will be of

enormous value to me.

Ah!

Value?

Oh, monetary value.

Uh.

Enormous.

[Ms. Yost] Uh.

[Mr. Lazar] Enormous.

[Ms. Yost] Uh.

Monetary value.

Uh.


Oh, nappy, you're really
speaking my language now.

Why Ms. Yost, I've never
seen you looking nicer.

Do me a favor?

Make this one a quicky, will you, you two?

I gotta pee.

Oh, and remember this is my bathroom.

A little hygiene would be appreciated.

I'm sure that the key to this matter

is my most recent acquisition.

This being is almost certainly responsible

for the revivification of the others.

So we kill him, the others are paste.

Is that the idea?

Kill?

Of course not.

Are you insane?

I mean that the new one is
the one we must reason with.

Persuade.

Their recent actions
were merely self-defense

in response to Ms.
Yost's irrational attack.

I truly believe they
do not mean to harm us.

No doubt they are hiding
some place now, terrified.

(specimens squealing)

(dramatic music)

Look, can we at least agree not to enter

into open combat 'til
all the little goobers

are locked up nice and safe?

Can we do that?

[Mr. Lazar] And who
exactly is gonna be doing

the locking up?

The rightful guardian.

[Mr. Lazar] Well, I
believe you're going to

monopolize the discovery
that should be, should be--

[Mr. Larco] Monopolized by you?

[Mr. Lazar] Yes.

Well, let me warn all of you.

This house is still sealed.

And only Sheila and I
know the proper code key

that will unlock the doors and windows.

This house is impervious.


[Mr. Kantor] Oh, what now?

Are you still out there?


Can you tell us what you want?


[Ms. Yost] You're
not planning on opening

that door, are you?

They stuck a note under the door before.

They can do it again.

Can you write down what you want from us?

We don't want to hurt you.

(pencil scribbling)

[Mr. Lazar] Listen.

(pencil scribbling)

How could they know how to write?

It makes no sense.

They did it before.

(specimen murmuring)

And is it a friendly message?

[Mr. Lazar] It's gibberish.

No, it isn't.

The message reads, "You hurt bad.

"Scared, hurt.

"We no stay.

"We go.

"You let us go.

"We no go, you die."

That certainly seems pretty clear.

[Mr. Larco] It is clear
that we are dealing in essence

with a single dominant intellect.

[Mr. Kantor] You mean
that double-face one.

[Mr. Larco] Yes.

If in fact this being is
only a day or two old,

then it has absorbed
human speech and reading

and a fairly sophisticated
level of comprehension

in just a matter of hours.

In addition, it seems to have some sort of

tentacle hormaphic power,

though it does not appear
to have influenced us.

It is an altogether new
kind of intelligence.

Perhaps a new species.


(specimen murmuring)


[Elvina] Mmm, mmm, oh, ah.

Mmm, mmm, ah, ah.

Mmm, mmm, ah, ah.

Mmm, ah, ah, ah.


Ah, get it off!

Ah! Ah! Ah!

No, please!

Ah! Ah!

Hold still, pinhead!

Oh, sorry, Doc!


[Both] Get him!


Oh, sick!

Somebody watch the door.

[Elvina] That pervert!

Pervert from hell!


[Mr. Kantor] Wait a second!

Don't go runnin' around!

Hold on, blondie, where are you goin'?

[Elvina] Help me! Help me!


Help me!

[Mr. Kantor] It got up there.

Where are you?


(glass breaking)

Jesus fucking Christ!

Did she hurt them?

No, no, I think they're okay.

Then get out of my way!

(specimen whimpering)

Little ones, I'll take you out of here.

But first you have to kill them.

Hey, hey, hey.

No, no, no, no, no.

Not all of them.

Just those two.

But first, you've got
to force them to tell

you the key code.

Don't listen to him.

It's dangerous out there.

Stay here with me.

You'll be safe.

I'll take you out for drives.

(specimen murmuring)

Come back.

[Ms. Yost] Excuse me.

Jesus, all we need is
a guy in a white suit

and a butterfly net to make
this freakin' scene complete.

Come out, come out little ones.

Come to papa.

Wherever you are, don't listen to him.

I'm your papa, me!

(specimen murmuring)

There, there you are.

Don't be afraid.

I'm not going to hurt you.

This is your home.

No, no, no.

You belong to me.

I'm the only one who's worthy of you.

Get back, you interloper.

No, he's mine!

[Both] No!

[Mr. Larco] You fool!

You bastard!

[Mr. Lazar] You're
nothing but a cheap fraud.


That's enough.

Let's settle this once and for all.

If you're man enough.

I was man enough to deal with you

before I collected my first
spheroid bryozoan colony.

No more words.

Steel only.

En garde.

(swords clanging)


Ah, excuse me, boys.

I'll just keep looking.

(swords clanging)


(dramatic music)


[Mr. Lorca] Ha, first blood.

[Mr. Lazar] Only fools
talk of fresh blood.

It's last blood that counts.


(swords clanging)

Watch my cyclanthera.

Sorry.

(swords clanging)


Go Doc, go Doc, go.

Man, if you can't stab him, nobody can.

Hell, Doc's my team.


[Mr. Lazar] I have you at last.

Our rivalry has come to an end.

And I am the victor!

(long tone)


Doc!


Hold on!

Hold tight!

[Mr. Zorca] Please, my specimens.

Please take care of my specimens.

Wait up first.

I'm taking care of you.

Come on.

Climb up, climb over,

come on.

Yes, yes.

Ahh!

No, no!


Come on, come on.

He's gone.

Where all that fuckin' acid
come from, I don't know.

But he's gone.

Come on, let's get the hell out of here.

No, beat it.

What?

You just stay back.

Stay away from me.

I mean it!

What the hell are you doing?

Doc said to take care of his specimens.

I'm gonna fucking take care of them.

What are you trying to do?

Kill yourself?

Just shut up!

All right, you little bundles of fun.

I know you can hear me so listen up.

You know what this is?

This is the way out.

You punch this number in
the panel in Doc's chair

and all the doors open up.

Come on.

Now we can all die together.

Come on, little babies.

Come on.

That's it.

That's it.

Come on.

One big, happy family.

Come on, you little bundles of fun, you.

That's it.

Come on.

Come on, you little angels.


Oh, good fucking riddance.

Well, what are you waiting for?

Let's go.

[Mr. Kantor] Yeow.

Nasty.

Looks like I'm not
gettin' paid for this job.

You got a car?

[Mr. Kantor] Yeah, you
plan on comin' with me?

[Sheila] No point stickin' around here.

No offense.

Looks like I'm gonna start
hittin' the want ads again.

[Mr. Kantor] Jesus.

[Sheila] I'm gonna go pack a few things.

(acid sizzling)

Sorry I don't have any
tables to sit on in here.

Just the usual bench seat.

I'm adaptable.

You know, I bet I'd be a
really good private detective.

You'd be great on surveillance the way

you just blend right in.

Well, I was thinkin'
more along the lines

of you being the brains,
me being the muscle.

You know, I can be very
loyal to the right employer.

So I noticed.

(suspenseful music)

(specimen murmuring)

(dramatic instrumental music)

(eerie dramatic music)
