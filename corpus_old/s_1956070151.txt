Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold 1995

Are you sure this is a good idea?

We will never know, unless we try.

But the dose has increased a lot

If there is no pain there is no gain

? Some friends?

This can also be dangerous
Yes

Ah ÙŠ you have a friend

Everything will be fine, I am aware that the dose is high
but we must see what we are capable of

TalvÃ©z I'm right n

But what about the dangerous part

Well, we should see what this thing does.

Bring the camera

Here is Doctor

Let's take some before and after photos

Look at the little bird

THE ATTACK OF THE MODELS OF 150 METERS

Wilson come here, come on.

Good.

Stu, no more snow.

Beautiful, that, good.

Great.

Stay like that.

Great... you know girls, if it were up to me, they would have my vote

But it's not like that.

When can we meet Mr. Gordon?

He is not supposed to personally select one of us.

Wilson, can you move, please.

In the house on the weekend.

? Really?

? This weekend?

He has invited everyone to his ranch in Malib.

He wants to know each of them personally.

And he wants us to do a special photo session on the beach.

And then you will choose me for the model.

It's a competition, it can be any of you.

What competition?

You really are a bitch.

Thanks.

,,, WILSON !!!

Could you please get out of my way? Thank you.

Good girls, beautiful, stay there.

Good.

That's it.

Good, another one.

Good girls, let's do it without a bra.

Look how snowy he got.

Leave him alone.

I think he likes you.

Great, to your girls locker room.

I think we all have the chance to win.

What do you think Inga?

Same.

The two are going to lose.

How can you be so sure?

Have you looked at a mirror lately?

What is that supposed to mean?

Hey, calm down, we have not finished n.

I mean, have you looked in the mirror lately?
?how old are you?

? 30?

I look in the mirror all the time.

I'm beautiful.

Is your chest shrinking?

Our records say it has been a year or since you stopped the program.

And obviously it works.

You are hermonsa.

I know it worked and worked well.

But I have to put it back on him.

Grace is praised, we require a waiting period of 5 years before restarting the envelment program, you know.

I know everything, program of envellecimiento, highly experimental.

Highly secret

But why the hell do you want to go back to the show?

She is an extremely attractive woman.

? I need to remind you how I looked before I started with this?

No, you do not need to remind me.

Before.

And later.

Look, I've noticed changes.

Changes in my body.

Do these look smaller?

They seem good to me.

Does this seem firm to you?

Definitely, without doubts.

I can feel it.

My faces are getting old.

That's how old Grace is, Grace, it happens to everyone.

My body is changing, I know.

And now I have the opportunity to be the model of a or.

And my breasts are shrinking.

Help me.

Although I would like to do it, it is very risky.

I beg you.

Look...

He has been using the drug of envellecimiendo.

That works with cell growth.

The alternatives for the body can be radically altered.

Using them for a short period, it's safe.

Do not bore me with the details Doc, just make it beautiful.

If you start with the program so soon, I can not tell you what can happen.

Please.

Your life may be in great danger.

By favorsito.

This suitcase contains 30 doses of the formula.

I can take only one dose a day.

Neither more nor less.

Any other dose can be fatal.

Whoever is out of my way, do you understand?

What to do here?

S doing some final touches.

Now, who are you looking for?

We were going to send those to Mr. Gordon.

Then, send them out.

Betty, destroying the photographs is not going to make you win the competition.
I know it is a brainiac, but it makes me feel better.

Good, good, tomorrow will be a long day.
TalvÃ©z if I sleep with him.

With that, it will be enough.

? Sleeping with who?
Bob Gordon.

I have the whole weekend to work on that.

Betty, let me give you a warning about Bob Gordon.

Stay away from him.

He has a girlfriend, who is extremely jealous.

But, you can sleep with me.

How good will that be?

So I like it

? Yes?

Bob speaks Eric, I'm in Lab 4,
I think you should come here.

What's up?

Hurry up

? Eric?... Eric?

Oh, God, what have we done?

What devil is going on?

You will not believe this.

Why we do not look.

I would not do that if it were you.

Open that door.

What is that noise?

Good...

I have... I have good news and bad news.

No, this is terrible.

What is the good news?

That's the good news.

Oh, God.

We should call Gobierto for this.

Without the Government.

Come here and they will take you all.

This is serious.

As well as losing our paycheck.

We can deal with this.

We need to call.

A good exterminator.

An excellent Exterminator.

Hello, hello.

Miss Grace, it's Dr. Lindstrom, I need to see her immediately, it's that...
Ha, she sends you e.

I'm not home now, but you can leave me a message and a credit card number.

It's Dr. Lindstrom, I need to talk to you, about... from...

Well you know that..., call me when you hear this message, it is urgent.

If you do not hear that message on time it may be too late.

We wish we knew where you are.

Look at this place.

It's incredible.

I wonder if you live only here.

You know, he looks like a fan of architecture.

I would say that Mr. Gordon sold some magazines.

Yes I did.

It has 9 holes.

Bob Gordon, owner of PlayThing magazine, a pleasure.

Betty, Betty Bennet, It is November.

I was saying what a wonderful home you have here.

Well, thank you, I appreciate it very much.

Inga, Inga Sorensen.

He is urinating ..
I know, Julio is urged, I will never forget him.

I'm very horny to meet you.

Good, and you should be marching March.

My friends call me Angel.

Angel.

Betty... Inga...

I am very happy because they could come.

Let's go inside and I'll give you the tour of the PlayThing mansion.

And of course we will arrive just for dinner.

Rosita, the suitcases.

We can help you.

No, nonsense, she can alone.

? Are you sure?

We do not care.

No, no, no, I'm the right kind of man.

Well, what do they say if we go in and start the tour?

Well you pray, here we are, the mansion n Plaything.

One of the most friendly places in the world.

Rosita, does not look very friendly.

Well, I do not pay much attention, it's always the same.

Good servitude is hard to find.

Servitude, Rosita, not her is not servitude,
I do not need servitude. She's my girlfriend.

Well the rooms are on the west side.

And the east wing in the night.

I would like to propose a toast.

For you three prayers.

The finalists the tenth contest is Ordered Plaything of a o.

It has always been a difficult decision.

But when looking at you, I must say that this is or is not an exception.

? We will not take photos on the beach?

Your beach

It has its beach plropia.

No, it's only 4 miles from it.

I can suggest a small dessert.

And then have a good night sleep.

You can suggest anything you want.

You know I want the best of you.

I like to meet people.

Rosita... dessert.

That looks delicious.

I do not want a big piece.

Thanks.

Rosita, sometimes she gets a little jealous.

But, do not worry, she has never hurt anyone.

I apologize a moment.

She has never hurt anyone.
I told them to stay away from him.

Not that you say it.
So that's your game.

Sleeping with him to be chosen the model of the o

You are so predictable.
Yes, I saw you touching it under the table, bitch.

Or, this can last for hours.

I think I'll make up my nose.

I know it after I saw you did not touch it first.

Putilla.
Slippery.

If you pray, excuse me...

You plan to stay.

Yes, this is exciting me.

Sow
Cow.

Maraca.
Putilla.

You already used that.

Mark, what a surprise.

I thought we could have a few drinks, and discuss the morning session.

I'm really tired.

You know, I spoke well of you Bob.

I hope you appreciate it.

If I appreciate it, but not tonight.

? Safe?

Wow, what a surprise.

I thought we could have some drinks, and discuss the morning session.

? What?

Let me guess, you spoke well of my Bob, and now you want to see if I appreciate it.

? How do you know?

You used that line 6 months ago in the Pleybunny session.

Let me ask you something, I used that line with Inga before?
Many times.

But I do not think the allas used with Angel.

You know, I think you're right.

Thanks.

Neither mention it.

Here you are.

Everything's over
All.

I have a confession to make.
What.

I'm drunk.

I like that in my women.

I have another confession.

Confess me.

I've always told Wilson that I think you're handsome.

Well, that's a coincidence.

Why?

Because, I also think that you are pretty.

? Deveras?

Deveras.

Should we be doing this?

I feel a little stunned.

I feel the same.

Stunned.

Passionate

"See you on the beach... Mark"

The beach

Oh, God... the photo shoot

Beautiful.
Now, look towards me.

One more.

Do not be panic

Do not be panic

Be phoenix

What am I going to do?

That's it, stay that way.

Beautiful.

Cari or this is to break the heart.

I'm sure this will work

Good, look at me.

Make love to the camera.

Look at the lens, that's it.

Beautiful.

That's it, stay that way.

Mmmm, Angel was late.

I can go find her.

I mean, it's just so...

We can give you 5 more minutes.

Good, stay like that.

What size are these?

Wilson, can you remove it from there?

One more.

Launch them, throw them.

Great.

Hey, here you are.

Hello.

What a pleasure you came.

Sorry to be late.

Do not worry, we are just beginning.

Are you not using tacos?

? Should I?

No, no, no, that's what...

You seem... higher

? S ÙŠ?

What vitamins are you taking?

I do not know

Good, good, come together.

That's it.

You are taller than me.

Well you pray, let me see some skin.

Great, beautiful.

Recharge.

I'm sorry you are praying, take a few minutes.

? Do you feel good?

Good, good, is that I had a few drinks last night

I'm fine.

Mark.

Come on.

Mmmm, it seems that competition is becoming easier

Shut up.

Do you think it gets better?
It seems to me that it's fine.

No, she does not seem well.

Well Wilson, I'll come back and I'll bring help.
I also.

I go with you.

S-S hurry up.

Hurry.

No, no, no, no, it's incredible, you'll love it.

Mr. Gordon, we need an ambulance, right away.

It's Angel, fainted on the beach.

Wait a moment, please.

What?

? Where is it?
I was here with Wilson.

WILSON.

You are probably on a side giving mouth-to-mouth breathing.

WILSON.

Hey, here I am.

Where is Angel?
?He is okay?

Define well.

Hello angel.

Ooooo... my...
God.

E-e-e-ste is Bob Gordon, cancel the ambulance.

Wilson, how the heck did this happen?

I do not know, she only grew it, and it grew and grew.

I'm scared.

Do you have any idea that... how is this?

All I remember is feeling a bit dizzy.

When I woke up...

... help me, I'm huge.

Good, good, let's calm down, it's all right Angel.

We will take care of you.

Well, what are your references are or...?
Sticker.

Dick Stricker.

Pretty boots.

I could take them from my desk, please.

Rat leather.

Genuine rat leather.

Perd n.

I made them myself.

You need other references.

Do you have any idea of the type of problems we have?

He has a rat.

It is not an ordinary rat.

I never heard.

You can not smoke in this building.

When can you start?

Take the one, not more.

Any other dose can be fatal

We must do something.

Call someone.

? Who?

I do not know, a Doctor.

You know I have a funny feeling that you will not find
_ giant women in the yellow pages

In addition, we must keep it a secret for now.

Why?

I want you to tell Angel that we will send him specialists
That will give us the time we need.

? Give us time?

What are you talking about?

Never learn what you owe.

Marky I'm talking about the great image.

I'm talking...

The model of 150 meters.

? Do you have any idea how much this chicha costs in sales for Plaything?

Boby, have you gone crazy?

60 million.

? So much?

Maybe so.

It is is...

It's... like a million for a foot.

Yes.

And you could have one of those feet if you help me.

What do you say Marky?

No, take your time, think about it.

? 60 million?

Come on, you tell me she's cute with you, just use it a little.

I can do that, I can do it.

? For how long?

It's enough to exploit it.

And after charging.

I will call some friends that I have in the Government.

And they will get her out of here.

What will you do?

Marky, what do you care?

I do not know, experiments, I think.

What difference there is, I have a contract with her.

So keep this quiet, okay?

The first thing I will do.

I will take pictures and I will throw it to the public.

We will make a fortune.

It was not a dream

Hey.

What are t and Bob plotting?

What do you mean?

I heard them talking about Angel.

Look, keep your mouth closed on this.

Do not you worry about her at all?

Wilson, we're talking a lot of direct.

I care about her.

I need to remind you that I am the one she cares about.

She's hot for me, not you, partner.

Face it.

Partner.

You gain something... you lose something.

I smell a rodent.

This is where we lost it.

The rat has been seen in many places in the building, we have not been able to record it.

Good.

I want to go in, I have work to do.

It's time for fun.

Come on Micky.

Come and look for it.

You're a little kid, are not you?

Angel, dear.

Angel, are you here?

? Where is that big fool?

? Angel?

? Mark?

How do you feel?

I'm scared.

Do not worry, everything will be fine.

I confide in me.

We will return to normal soon.

? And what if not?

What will happen to me?

Here, are you for you?

? Can you contact my Doctor for me?

His name ed Paul Lindstrom.

He has a clinic in L.A.

Tell him what happened.

Yes, yes, sure, what you want dear.

What will happen to me?

Everything will be fine, Bob is calling specialists.

I hope they come soon.

? Is it okay?

Good.

I think it's the flowers.

Better the boto.

Yes, you must be careful.

? Is it okay?

Yes, it's about relaxing, I'll see you later.

? Mark?

Do you want to enter a moment?

I do not think it's a good idea for now.

TalvÃ©z later.

Do not be afraid

TalvÃ©z measures 150 meters, but I'm still a woman.

It is that I have a tremendous headache at this time.

How about tomorrow?

? Did you believe it?

Everything.

The whole story.

He asked me to make his Doctor.

What did you say?
I told him I would.

But it is something comical.

I can not remember the name the type.

Good boy.

Doc, where do you want this?

I want her on the third floor, something funny happens, come on.

Are you sure it's okay?

Nothing hurts him.

Do not be ridiculous, those men are professionals.

Come on.

Well girls, the good news is that Angel will be fine.

I'm making it as comfortable as I can.

I even sent a specialist to come see.

And what about the competition?

Well, I'll need a few more days to decide.

You will understand, but this does not mean that the contest is over.

It's a delay, but this is resolved.

Meanwhile, I want you to keep the closed vocals about Angel.

? When can we see it?

I do not think it is prudent to disturb her
the poor one is very upset.

A n does not know anything about Angel Grace.
Nothing is answered by the answering machine.

Jur that I heard something.

? That is absolutely necessary?

We do not know how big that rat is.

Be careful with that thing.

Good.

Come on.

It's enough, I resign.

Ready for today's action.

I brought my camera to take some pictures.

I'm very tired.

I really want to start with modeling, not as soon as possible.

TalvÃ©z ma ana, could you locate Dr. Lindstrom?

Look, it's 12 o'clock, I should be here already, I'll ask Bob later.

I want to be normal again, that's all.

Cari or t you are normal, except for the part of the 150 meters.

I feel so extra to.

How Godzilla or something.

You are much more beautiful than Godzilla.

No without makeup.

That reminds me, I have something to make you happy.

WILSON.

Wilson, bring it.

? Bring that?

Something Bob ordered to do specially for you, I hope you enjoy it.

Wilson, come on.

Hey...

What is that?

Lipstick

Thanks.

And how is the food?

You know what I really need now.

? What?

? Can I help you?

Yes...

Can I order 250 Fatburgesas?

Please.

Do you want fries with that?

Yes.

? To serve or carry?

To carry.

Definitely to carry.

Yes, of course.

I hope this works.

Well let me show you.

Here is Angel Grace and here is the rat.
I know, the differences do not tell me.

We'll do this to that.

And do it small or again.

Care.

You did it.

We did it.

Yes, we did, right?

Now we need to locate Angel Grace.

Well, this presents a problem.

At least Angel is not a rat.

It's not what I hear.

Wilson, what time is it?

It's too late.

Listen, we need to talk.

Listen, I do not have much time

If they know I was talking to you, I will have serious problems.

Who are they?

Mark and Mr. Gordon.

What are you talking about?

Angel, they're just using you.

Plan to continue with the model and explore.

And then turn yourself in to the government to get tested.

But it will bring specialists to help me.

They told you that, just to keep you here.

I do not think so.

I try to make you see.

? See what?

That Mark does not love you.

But I do.

Wilson.

I do not want to be hurt Angel.

I am a woman, I can take care of myself.

But...

You're wrong with Mark.

I know you care about me.

And I'm glad that you too.

Yes... I better go.

Do me a favor...

Follow up with the Clinica Lindstrom in L.A.

And talk to Dr. Paul Lidstrom

And ask him, why has not he arrived?

Who is Dr. Lindstrom, Angel?

He's my Doctor.

And I told Mark to tell him it was an emergency and I told him that...

? And what if Mark did not make the call?

Mark would not do that to me.

? O s ÙŠ?

What are you doing?

I'm doing the same thing as you.

I was hungry.

That's not the kitchen, it's Bob Gordon's bedroom.

? Really ?, I had no idea.

That's wrong

What are you doing here?

I was also hungry.

49 beer bottle on the wall

49 beer bottle.

But a bottle fell.

49 beer bottles on the wall

You know, I can not stand the drunks.

Give me a beer.

Friends, do not allow friends to drive drunk.

? Yes?

And friends, do not allow friends to walk home either.

Good point.

? Did you see that?

? What?

I do not know.

They were like a pair of giant legs.

Yes... sure.

Let's go.

I swear I saw something.

? You smell?

It's like perfume.

Shut up, you're still drunk.

There is something out there.

No, it's probably a tremor or something.

Excuse me.

Can you tell me the way to the village?

What idiots.

Or yes, you could see them in the sky as clear as water.

They fly in the sky like lightning flashes, like flying relamists.

? That was before or after being abducted by aliens?

Before, I never saw them coming.

? Say that the leader has a name?

Or yes, so I can say your name e-e-e-ra Regie.

? Regie?

Yes, Regie.

Well, you never know what you want to say, in another language.

I think it was Regie.

You know, it sounded like Regie.

When I asked him he said...

What's your name, mate?

And he looked me straight in the eye and said... Regie... Regie.

As same.

And he said he was going back tonight.

The mother ship has, that must be like now.

That's why I called your newspaper.

For you to tell how it was.

Nothing affects you Se or.

Yes the daily inquisitor.

Integrity is his middle name.

I have a client.

10 and make it fast

I know what I saw.

And you saw it also because you were with me.

Shut your mouth, fine.

What did he just say?

Do not believe what we saw.

What was it?

It was a woman, a giant woman.

? How big?

It was there, it was about 100 meters.
Shut up.

We did not see anything,?

Not started a n.
Well, hurry up, we want to leave here.

You should also leave.

I can not leave, I'm waiting for the mother ship.

Are you all crazy around here?

Only me.

Hey, do not they want your fuel?

Where is it going?

To look for a woman, and exit the mother ship by me.

They are late.

WELCOME TO SEASCAPE

Hello.

Would it bother you to give me a drink?

Take everything is orita, I can not anymore.

Thanks.

Do not mention it.

What will I do?

Yes, Daily the Inquisitor.

What do you want?

A lot

What the hell are you doing there?

Look, something happened.

I will need one more days.

Flying saucer or not, it was supposed to come back yesterday.

Someone said that I saw a giant woman.

We have a date, now take the next flight and leave there.

If I know it sounds crazy, but I think it's worth investigating.

Well, investigate that giant woman, but
better be right, it's better.

He's good boss, I'll find her.

Hehehe, nothing surprises me.

You know, I'll need more money, say 100.

? Hello ?, Hello?

? Hello?

Hello.

? Dr. Lindstrom?

Angel asked me to contact him.

Something happened and needs your help.

What happened?

I do not know how to say esop, but... I grew up a little.

? Where is it?

I'm on Gordon's property.

The Plaything mansion, do you know where it is?

Yes.

Betty.

What's going on here Wilson?

What do you mean?

Do not look at me like that.

I am an armored person.

You know that.

I want a direct answer about this contest.

Do you want an answer?

Yes.

Look at the central page, read it and cry.

I will become a millionaire.

We could take a pair with you standing up.

? As?

Perfect.

I'm glad you decided to take these pictures.

I trust in you Mark.

Yes, of course, could you move a little to your left ?, please.

On the right, yes same.

Great.

As same.

Good.

This is great.

Great, yes, same.

Stay like that.

Stay like that.

Good.

One more, one more.

Upss, forgive n.

Perd n.

It's fine, it was hot.

Come on.

Here we go.

Good, good.

Great.

As ÙŠ.

Put them together, well, well.

It looks good.

Good, move to the right now.
Good good good.

Come on, smile, smile, come on baby.

Likewise, it looks tight.

Yes, Good, good.

If you have it, like that, well.

Good, one more, one more.

Here we go.

Stay like that.

I'm telling you, Angel somehow arranged it.

How would she want to have 150 meters to be the model of a or?

Yes, definitely.

Nobody wants to win so much.

She jokes what she wants, but that does not change that she arranged it.

Have you seen the size of her breasts?

How could I not?

Betty, calm down, it's just a contest.

Be the Plaything of the year, it is not just a contest.

I have worked all my life for this.

And now Angel grows a few meters and is selected over me.

How would it have happened anyway?

We should find out.

? How should we?

Well, he cheated us both.

You must do something.

Come on.

You cover the sun.

Good.

Hello Angel.

She looks pretty today.

Pretty as a photo.

Where is Mark?

Well he's...
I'm here.

I will give you the pictures of money.

? How are you?

Good, I think.

I am anxious because these specialists arrive.

Yes, I can not imagine that it takes so long.

I want them to arrive soon, I want to be normal again.

I'm sure I know.

If someone can help you with Bob's specialists.

I hope you're right.

I would hate it to be another lie.

Ha, another lie.

Those specialists do not exist.

? Or are there?

Betty, where are you?

Betty, are you here?

Sure, there are specialists, Angel.

You do not know what you're talking about

She knows exactly what she is talking about.

Hey, what side are you on?

I'm on the side of her.

Angel, there were never any specialists, they lied to you all the time.

And do not bother to say goodbye.

I resign.

M-look, Angel, Bob and I, we only care about you.

We always wanted to do the best for you, dear.

How could you do this to me?

You will be famous.

? How?, A phenomenon.

An act of circus.

No, no, you will be...

Bigger than Elvis.

Do not listen to them.

Look around you, there are many beautiful people.

But t, you're unique.

Do not bet.

I thought you would go out with yours, cheating, right?

Well, think again.

No.

You can not, I will win this contest.

This can not be happening.

Are you Dr. Lindstrom?
Yes.

There is no time to lose, help me with this.

? This will make it normal again?
Yes.

The tranquilizer will make them slower, enough to apply the cure.
Come on.

Baby, this month I can pay the rent.

Angel, it's me, Dr. Lindstrom.

I have a cure.

Dr. Lindstrom, help me.

We will make them normal again.

Help me.

You are not stopping them.

It is not stopping.

I better go.

Hello.

God, I mat.

No, it's just a tranquilizer.

Come on, returned to my car.

? Is it okay?

Mr. Gordon.

No, no.

This seems painful.

Stamina

Sorry, I could not warn you about Betty.

? Where were they?

I do not know.

Can you walk?

I will return it to the house.

Vac ÙŠ o.

This is not a good se al.

BIGGERING BITCH
VODKA
FOR TODDLER WOMEN TODAY

It's not what you think.

Save who can.

Two giant women, we need reinforcements, immediately.

No.

I do not know how big they are, they are giants.
