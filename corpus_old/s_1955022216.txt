[Indistinct shouting, camera

[Shutters clicking]

Turn around.

Look over your shoulder.

That's a good girl.

Turn around and look over

Your shoulder.

[Indistinct shouting


This is fun.

Do you think this is fun?

No. No... this is literally

My worst nightmare.

I mean, I hate having my photo

Taken.

Yeah, me too, actually.


My grandma bought me this dress,

And I thought I really liked it,

And now I feel so

Self-conscious.

No, you look beautiful.

Really?

Yeah.

Oh, that's so sweet.

[Indistinct shouting]

These people are making me so

Uncomfortable.

I feel like I'm gonna be

Attacked by them.

I know. I know.

It makes me not actually want to

Be an actress if this is what it

Is.

Really?

I have the same feeling.

I'm actually thinking of

Becoming a history teacher.

Just Jesse... Jesse alone,

Please.

Oh, yeah. All right, cool.

See you around.

Okay, yeah.

Seriously, you look great.

Oh, thank you.

Hey. Michael ausiello from

Tvline.Com.

Congratulations on the movie.

How are you holding up?

Uh, my palms are really

Sweaty, and I think I forgot to

Put deodorant on, so...

Anyway.


It gets easier.

Champagne?

Oh, I'm not really much of a

Drinker.

I'm sorry.

Halley, you're needed over here.

Oh, just one second.

You go.

You're famous now.

Oh. [Chuckles]

Actually, you know what?

Can you give me just one second?

I'm sorry. [Chuckles]


Hey, Michael?

You want to try it in my butt

Again?


Halley... No. I don't.


We only have a couple weeks

Left to get this draft done if

We want to submit it to the

Sanddunes screenwriters lab.

Yep. Good point. Good point.


Yep, that's fun.

You want to drunk-dial Ryan?

Halley, we're not calling

Your brother.

Stop watching

"Dancing with the stars" and

Help me write our screenplay.

And put that camera away.



This conversation tomorrow

Unless I videotape it.

Maybe you shouldn't drink so

Much.


[Cork pops]

Did you just open that

One-handed?

I'm that talented.

[Up-tempo music plays]

Ah! Aww!

Whoo!

Okay.

Yes!

Did you see that foxtrot?

Yep.

Ooh!

Ralph macchio is trÃ¨s foxy!

I've loved him ever since he

Played the sexually confused

Best friend of Eric stoltz in

"Naked in New York."

Really?

I've only seen him in

"The karate kid."


Hey!

Macchio should be in my movie.

What... you mean our movie?

Yeah, right, right, right,

Right, right, right, right.

What part would he play?

Your part?

Halley!

Just kidding!

That's it.

Mm-hmm.

Um...

Are you fully erect?

Yeah.

Um...

Your penis feels really small.

Halley!

Okay.

Never mind. Whatever you say.


[Clears throat]

Are you... are you not

Attracted to me anymore?

Halley.

Yeah, see, no, your penis is

Getting smaller by the second.

I bet Ralph macchio wouldn't

Have any trouble getting it up

With me.

Oh, my God.

Okay, that's it.

What do you mean "that's it"?

What are you doing?

What?! What?!

What are you doing?

Michael.

What?

Michael, what are you doing?

Aah!

I'm leaving.

I'm confused.

What does that mean?

Okay, you know what?

Okay, yeah, I know that you're

In the new "men in black" movie,

But I think someone in this room

Is being a little overly

Dramatic.

You've been treating me like

Shit for a really long time,

Halley.

I love you, but I can't let

Myself be treated like that.

I'm sorry.

You're just not the person I

Fell in love with on the set of

"The messenger."

What?

Ugh.


What are you doing?

[Voice breaking] I look

Really beautiful when I cry.

Are you gonna put some

Clothes on at least?

[Normal voice] It's just a

Medium shot.

You can't see my cooter.

Jesus.

Halley, you're so self-involved.

All you do is... is videotape

Yourself, think about yourself,

Talk about yourself, write about

Yourself.

Google myself.

Google yourself, drink

Alcohol by yourself.

But it's delicious!

You have a drinking problem,

And you have a thinking problem.

You have a rhyming problem.

You're not funny.

You just don't think I'm

Funny because you don't have a

Very good sense of humor.

That's why "the messenger"

Wasn't funny at all.

Okay, yeah.

Well, you think that I don't

Have a sense of humor because I

Didn't find this card funny.

How is that funny?

A picture of you in bed with

Some other guy?

I don't even know who that is.

And you photoshopped my

Brother's head onto his body.

It looks like he's entering you,

Halley.

Michael, did you even take

The time to read what I wrote

Inside?

Look.

"I love you so much I would

Never sleep with your brother."

So there you go.

That's beautiful.

You should write greeting cards

For a living.

Oh, Michael!

You know what? It's funny!

No, it's not.

Yes, it is!

Is this just because of what I

Said about Ralph macchio?

He's like number 23 on the

Ifdbpro star tracker.

Halley, you know I don't care

About that stuff.

Yeah, that's why you're

Number 20,526.

Really?

Yeah.

You want to play that game?

Sure.

Let's play that game.

Great.

Um, let's see here.

Halley feiffer... oh, look.

You're number 10,101.

Exactly!

That's why we need the karate

Kid to bring up the curve!


You think you're so great?

Why don't you do something about

Your own career?

Oh. Yeah...

He's way more famous than you!

That's not my fault!

Some amazing things together.

I feel so blessed.


Really, I do.

Girl, we are the blessed

Ones.

You could've signed with anyone,

You fresh-faced little munchkin

You!

Ooh!

[Both laugh]

Oh, my God! Gina!

Hey! Did you get my message?

Hi, halley.

Uh, yes, if you can just give me

A minute.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, hey, mamie!

Hey.


Thank you.

So, I hug. We hug.

Gina.

Okay.

[Both laugh]

Now, do you need any help

Getting to all your meetings

This week?

Jessica can book you a car

Service.

Oh, no, no, no. That's fine.

Thank you. Thanks.

Are you sure?

Yeah, yeah.

Okay, well, if you need

Anything, you let me know.


I'm always here.

I have no social life.

Phbt!


Okay. Thank you.

Bye, Jessica. Bye, Gina.

Oh, wait! I hug, we hug.

We're hugging? Okay.

I dropped my...

Oh, I got it! I got it!

Oh, my God!

My brother dates him.

The gay guy from "ugly Betty."

Really?

Michael's a client.

Oh, he's so sweet.

Ah, yeah, I know.

He's gonna be the man of honor

At my wedding.

Not your brother?

Do you want to keep it?

What? Oh, no, no, no.

No, keep it.

Really?

Totally.

Oh. Thank you.

Okay. Bye.

Bye!

Oh! She's so sweet.

You look beautiful!

Love you, gummer.

Okay, let's do this.

Trifles, really.

Um, okay.

So, you just signed

Mamie gummer?

She's meryl streep's daughter.

People say I'm the poor man's

Her.


Um, can you give me her e-mail?

Halley, nothing I said on the

Phone has changed.

"A," can I have a piece of

Your baguette?

Mmm.

"B," I have a really exciting

Movie idea that I need your help

With.

And "c," spring-clean your

Canvas.

I have eaten hundreds of dried

Fruits.

I'm sitting on the toilet with

Diarrhea oozing out of me

Slowly, like a mister softee.

The diarrhea...

Symbolic of my career.

The dried fruits?

You guessed it. That's you.

I was in the biggest indie of

The last century...

Noah baumbach's

"The squid and the whale."

I mean, ring-a-ding-ding-dong.

I know you love ding dongs.

Listen to me.

Can you listen?

I took a six-week course on

Listening with Austin Pendleton.

"The squid and the whale" had

A limited release six... or

Seven years ago... and you

Played a supporting role.

Um, aloha?

I was the only

Sympathy-garnering character in

A movie populated exclusively by

Narcissistic literati, little

Miss "I'm smarter than my"

Client."

I'm sorry.

I don't need to make fun of the

Way you think and speak to when

It's already obvious enough that

You can barely fit into that

Chair.

Aah! Sorry!

I haven't had a drink yet this

Morning.

No one will hire you because

You drink too much.

You're starting to get a

Reputation.

I am so sorry.

Have you forgotten who my father

Is?

World-famous

Pulitzer prize-winning satirist

Jules feiffer.

Most people don't even know

He's still alive!

I can get you in touch with

People in our h.R., and they can

Help you find a rehab that takes

Your insurance.

Re-hab?


You mean like a publicity stunt.

I like it. I like it.

Halley, no.

Not a publicity stunt.

You are a great actress, and I

Have much faith in your talent.

But you have become rude and

Unruly and impossible to work

With.

You need to make a significant

Change in your life, and if you

Don't, I can no longer work with

You.

Shh! Shh, shh, shh!

Are you done?

Okay, great.

I'm gonna come in next week, and

We can finish this little

"Intervention" once I have a

Tasty drink under my belt.

I'm letting you go.

Fine. [Sniffles]

Fine.

You want to know why that's

Fine?

I'm gonna take this piss-poor

Attitude of yours and spin a web

Of gold with it!

I'm writing my own movie.

In fact, it's basically already

Written!

That's right!

I'm starring in it, and it's

Gonna get into the sanddunes

Screenwriters lab.

Oscar gold, here comes mama!

And guess who's not getting 10%?

Fatty McGee! And that's you!

[Door opens]

* see, oh, you pretty thing *

* you demon, psycho, bat shit *

* whack job, insane *

* c-r-azy *

* c-r-azy *

* they'll throw you away

If you go all the way *

I should have never let you

Into my life in the first place.

You don't understand how

Talented I am.

I'm gonna be the biggest movie

Star you ever heard of!

* throw away the key *

Ryan, Ryan, hey, Ryan?

I have to talk to you, like,

Right now, Ryan.

Oh, my God, Ryan.

Are you there, ry...

Geez, halley, what?

Oh, my God, I have something

Really important to tell you.

What? What?

What's the matter?

Oh, my God.

Ooh. Whoa. God.

If you didn't like sticking your

Penis in other boys' mouths, I

Would totally smunk your donk.

That's disturbing.

Why?

Because you're my sister.

Okay, I have something

Vitally crucial to tell you, but

Before I do, do you have any

Alcohol?

Sure, I think we have

Something, but geez, halley,

It's like not even noon.

So, what is it? What's going on?

Oh, my gosh.

Hmm?

It's not dad, is it?

No, no, no.

I know he's like 100, but it's

Not him.

All right, then what is it?

I feel, like, nervous.

I kind of feel, like, sad all of

A sudden.

I know. Me too.

Me too.

Okay.

Are you ready?

Yeah.

Oh, don't make that face.

All right.

Throwing caution to the wind...

Okay.

You're so pretty.


Okay. This is hard.

Okay, what is it?

All right, I'm just gonna go

For it.

Do it.

Will your boyfriend...

Three-time teen choice award

Nominee Michael urie, the gay

Guy from "ugly Betty"... play my

Boyfriend in my movie?

Look. [Laughs]

Aah!

Open it. Open it.

It's my screenplay!

Aah! Can you believe it?

Open it again.

It's my screenplay!

What? Isn't that awesome?

Where are you going?

Ryan, what are you...

Did you see... Ryan, did you

See... ry... i just went through

My flipcam and transcribed

Everything that happened between

Me and Michael chernus.

It's gonna be next year's

"Blue Valentine."


What are you... Ryan!

It took me all night and two

Pitchers of sangria to assemble

That genius packaging.

Oh, that is what you wanted

To talk to me about?

Yeah.

You made this sound so

Urgent!

I thought somebody had died.

Somebody did... my career!

Uh-huh.

Ryan, why are you

Minimalizing this?

I am the most pathetic

Out-of-work actor on the streets

Of New York or maybe even the

Planet.

That whore bag mamie gummer

Pretends that I'm a stranger

Even though I pole-danced for

Matthew broderick at her

Birthday party.

That was Haley Joel osment!

Aah! Stop correcting me,

Ryan!

You didn't even go to college!

I have been at Juilliard for

The past seven years.

Oh, so you're getting your

Master's in air?

That is not nice.

You know what?

Ryan, why are you doing this?

You always make everything about

You, Ryan.

Halley, look.

What?!

You have worked with the most

Incredible people, and you've

Never even had formal training.

I mean, I've never even had an

Agent.

Well, neither do I, anymore,

And I always liked that your

Career was worse than mine, and

Now I think we're on the same

Level, and that makes me want to

Fucking kill myself!


No, Ryan... this is rude!

I'm not drunk enough yet.

Look, halley, why do you want

Michael?

Why can't you just put me in

Your movie?


How is that funny?

Ryan, you can't play my

Boyfriend.

You're my brother.

Halley.

What?

It is 2011.

Nobody cares if ice skaters are

Siblings.


We'll just get, like, a body

Double for the sex scenes, and

If we need to kiss, we'll cut

Away or something.

Okay, do you really need me

To spell it out for you?

I guess I do.

This is very, very sad.


That was my blanket.

Can you read?

Yep. I can read.

Great.

Great.

I need somebody famous!

Okay.

The script is, honestly, more

About Vanessa Williams than

Anything else.

Vanessa Williams?

You never once mentioned she's

In the script.

Well, she is now.

Hey, what is America ferrera

Doing post- "Betty"?

Maybe she could direct it?

There is no way America is

Available.

She's way too famous.

But actually...

Michael is looking to branch out

Into directing.

What?

The gay guy from "ugly Betty"

Directs?

Then I could be in it.

Oh, my God!

The gay guy from "ugly Betty" is

Gonna direct my movie?

I'm gonna be the best

Michael chernus ever.

Ohh!

[Crash, bell rings]

Halley?

I'm still biking.

All right, just put this on

Here.

Just hold that there for a

Minute, okay?

Okay.


Okay.

Yeah, just...

Oh, I like that. Harder.

Mmm, smooth that.

Oh, yeah, it feels good.

Oh, yeah. Harder. Harder. Mmm.

Okay, miss feiffer...

Oh, you know my work?

No, you ask me that every

Time... I've not seen your

"Whale" movie.

Fine, fine, fine. What?

It's just a minor cut this

Time, but you should really

Think about cutting back on your

Drinking.

I wasn't drinking.

You've called 91116 times

With alcohol-related injuries.

There, now I can see your

Beautiful brown eyes.

Please don't touch me.

This isn't a joke.

You could really hurt yourself.

[Smacking lips]

Could you get out of my

Ambulance now?

Will you lift me out and

Gingerly place me on my bike?

No.

Okay.

Mnh-mnh.

Help! Oh!

I think I have vertigo.

I'm falling.

My bones are melting because of

Radiation.

I was in chernobyl.

I'm an orphan.

Bye!

[Siren wails]

We need to talk to the gay

Guy from "ugly Betty" right away

Before I get another concussion.

Well, I think I agree with

Him.

You should probably cut back on

Your drinking.

Ryan! [Sighs]

Some of the greatest artists of

All eternity had alcohol and

Drug problems... river Phoenix,

Janis joplin, Marilyn Monroe.

Maybe you should try drinking

More.

You might become a better actor.

But they all died.


To be number one on the star

Tracker.

Really?

No.


[Indistinct shouting]

I have to cheat. I'm losing.

I don't care if you're

Losing.

[Door closes]

Shh, shh, shh.

Hey, babe.

Hey, baby.

Hey, babe!


Hey, halley.

How'd it go?

Oh, you know. Pretty good.

Oh!

Halley, you look so cute.

Thank you.

I got my head bandaged.

Oh, yeah. What happened?

Oh, um, just an amazing

Meeting with Darren aronofsky

For "black swan 2"... so many

FouttÃ©s.

But anyway, Ryan has been

Chomping at the bit to ask you a

Dire straits question, right,

Uh-huh.

So, um, halley and I have been

Working on a screenplay idea.


It's more like a comment on real

Life.

Mm-hmm.

Mm. Cool. What's it about?

Uh, what's with the camera?

Oh, um, you know what?

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

It is part of the process.

'Kay.

Um, it's basically a simple

Love story, centering around

Halley and me as her

Ex-boyfriend, Michael chernus.

We're the leads.

[Both laugh]

And, um...

Vanessa Williams.

Uh-huh.

So, uh, you guys play boyfriend

And girlfriend in this, uh,

Movie?

It's okay. He's gay.

No one will care.


Okay, actually, halley, could

You not film me right now?

I don't really feel comfortable

With that.

Did you see

"Capturing the friedmans"?

Yeah.

This is like that.

Okay, whatever.

So, what halley and I were

Just pondering today over

Cycling, boxed wine, and

Ambulance visits...

Would you be in to directing it?


Direct what?

What is there to direct?


Babe, can I talk to you in

Private for a second?

Um, okay.

I really don't understand

What it is you're asking me to

Do here.

Well, first off, I would just

Like you to support me.

I do support you.

Oh, okay, great. Thanks.

Thank you.

And secondly, I need you, more

Than anything, to help us with

This because I have had a lot of

Rejection, and I just need to do

Something important.

And if we don't do this as a

Team, it'll never happen, and I

Will never amount to anything

More than Jules feiffer's son

Who went to Juilliard for a

Decade and dated that... that

Gay guy from "ugly Betty"!

Okay, okay, okay. Shh.

Let's just say that I will help

You guys brainstorm this movie,

Okay?

And we can take it one step at a

Time.

Okay, great. Thanks.

Thank you.

But the sanddunes screenwriters

Lab deadline is in two weeks,

And we have to make that

Deadline.

What... [Sighs]

Well, what do you have to do for

The deadline?

Um, the first 10 pages of

Your script, a letter of intent,

And, to set ours apart, we want

To film a five-minute teaser

Trailer.

Teaser trailer?

Support me!

Okay. Okay.

God, does halley have to play

Herself?

Couldn't we get, like,

Mamie gummer?

Michael!

Okay, okay, okay.

I will help you guys with your

Teaser trailer.

We'll see how that goes, and

Then we'll move from there,

Okay?

"Dealsies."



Halley. Oh, no!

Oh, my God!

Halley! Oh, halley!

[Siren wails]

Bye!

Thank you for my bandages.

See you soon.

Text me if you're lonely.

What are you doing for

Thanksgiving?

Why did he say that was your

Last 911 visit?

I think he has a drinking

Problem.

It's really sad, actually.


Tracee! Oh, my God!

Tracee!

Aaaah!


Oh, my God, I haven't seen

You since the show ended.


Errands for Ben stiller?

Yeah, he has me running all

Around town, buying specially

Engraved iPods for his

Housekeepers.

Oh, you are so lucky you get

To assist such a dreamboat of a

Movie star.

Does he ever... Ask about me?

No, halley.

His experience on Broadway with

You was not very positive.

Okay.

Well, if he does ever change his

Mind about my hj offer, I will

Totes check my avail.

What's up with your face?

Um, it's for a part.

Are you gonna meet Ben stiller

Right now, by any chance?

Yes, he's rented an holistic

Colonics studio for his whole

Family and staff for labor day,

So we're gonna go have dinner

And then go over there... why?


Please, can I come?

Please, please, please, please?

No, halley.

Please, please, please.

No.

Please, please!

No!

Hey, halley, we're gonna go

Back upstairs!

Okay! Bye, master urie!

So good seeing you.

Thank you so much for directing

My movie!

Bye, tracee!

Bye, urie!

What movie?

I'll tell you all about it on

Our way to meet master stiller.

Can you see my tits in this

Thing?

Yeah, your nipples look

Really good and hard, like

Little baby fingertips.

Really?

Mm-hmm.

[Cellphone beeps]

Thank you!

Who are you texting?

Okay, so, I'm texting with

Stiller.


I know... but he says he's

Not coming to dinner now that

You've crashed.

What?

Well, halley, the last time

You saw him, you asked him if

You could make a semen milkshake

With his seed.

I make a really good shake.

But regardless, did you ask him

If he wants a life-changing role

In my movie?

[Cellphone beeps]

Yeah, he said his eardrums

Were clicking last night, so he

Didn't get much sleep, so he

Can't do the movie.

Lame.

Thanks.

Oh!

No! No, no honey, no sugar, no

Fructose.

I have an eating disorder.


Way to set a boundary,

Girlfriend.

I'm so proud of you.

I think it's so progressive how

Open you are about your

Anorexia-bulimia.

Thank you!

You know, they do say that the

First step to recovery is

Actually admitting that you have

A problem.

Yeah.

Well, maybe we can be roommates

In rehab.

[Both laugh]

'Kay, I'm gonna go to the

Bathroom, change my tampon, and

Maybe wash my hands... brb.


Hey, this is Jesse.

Uh, leave a message.

I'll get back to you as soon as

Possible.

Thanks.


Hey, Jesse, it's halley

Again.

Um, I have some very exciting

News to tell you.

Um, there's some superamazing

Stuff going on in my life right

Now.

I could really use a friend to

Share all this bounty with.


Anywho... [Laughs]

I was just having a drink and

Thinking of you.


I remember how much fun we had

In between setups on

"The squid and the whale."

That must seem like a million

Years ago for you... you've done

So many movies since then.

But, um...

Sometimes when things are really

Good, you can feel really

Lonely.

I wonder if that's how you felt

On Oscar night.

I hope it isn't, but, um...

If it is, I just want you to

Know...

You're not alone. [Laughs]

Anyway. [Laughs]

That's all. I love you.

Hope you're doing good, peanut.

[Indistinct conversations]

Are you okay?

Oh, yeah, totally.

Um, so, now that the

Stillmeister is out, who's gonna

Play Ryan's part in my movie?

Tracee, we have to get someone

More famous than Ryan.

I mean, can you imagine walking

Down the street and passing a

Movie poster with Ryan's face on

It?

Ew! No one would go see that

Movie.

Let me lob this idea to you

And see what you buy.

In exchange for an executive

Producer credit, how would it

Tickle you if I were to contact

My dear friend and genius

Ralph macchio?



Stay golden, pony boy.

Stay golden.


Don't die on me, Johnny.

Don't die.

Come on, Johnny, don't die.

Don't die on me, Johnny!

Don't die!

Johnny, come on!

So, this is what you get, huh?

This is what you get for helping

People?

Oh, bastard!

No! [Crying]

That was a dramatization of my

Favorite scene from

"The outsiders" starring

Ralph macchio as a gentle beast.

Wow.

Hand me the karate kid on a

Silver platter wearing only a

Doily, and you've got yourself

An e.P. Credit.

We are gonna win oscars.

Cheers.


* there's no business

Like show business *

* like no business I know *

* nowhere could you get that

Happy feeling *


* when you are feeling that

Extra bow *

* there's no people

Like show people *

* they smile when they are low *

Mr. feiffer, so good to see

You.

Thank you for letting us shoot

At your house.

* that night you open *

* and there you are *

* next day on your dressing

Room, they've hung a star *

Mm! Is this my prop beer?

Yes, ma'am.

Oh, awesome.

Can we swap it out for a real

Beer?

[Both laugh]

N-no.

Okay, what about a light

Beer?

No... okay...

Listen, my friend worked on

"Harry and the Hendersons," and

She said that John lithgow does

Coke on all his sets.


She said that John lithgow

Does coke in the middle of

Scenes while they're filming,

And you cannot even tell.

Okay.

Okay, it's my dad's country

Estate, and I can do whatever I

Want, so...

[Can opens]

Hey, halley. How's it going?

Tracee, how do you think it's

Going?

There's no rosÃ©, there's no

Birthday cake.

I know I specifically asked for

A claw-footed bathtub, complete

With resplendent bubbles.

And, ugh, low-fat muffins?

Serves me right to ask the

Anorexic-bulimic girl to stock

The craft services table.

Okay, look, um, we still

Haven't heard from macchio.

No. No. No. No!

I can't shoot any scenes with my

Brother.

He's terrible.

It would be like doing theater

In Los Angeles.

Okay, just start shooting

With that.

And you know, okay, once we get

Ralph... and we will get

Ralph... we'll just impose him

In with reshoots or green

Screens or mirrors or cgi or

Something.

Okay, I'm trusting you with

My life, tracee.

The sanddunes screenwriters lab

Deadline is in 10 days.

My word is my oyster.

Hey, halley.

Oh, hey.

Hey.

Um, can i... can I talk to you

For a second?

Yeah. Totally.

Can I get a p.A. To make you

Some coffee or something?

We have a gevalia maker.

Whoa! A gevalia maker?

Yeah, stiller's idea.

Wait. What?

Yeah, he wanted it, according

To tracee.


Yeah. Cut us a check.

Isn't that rad?

No. Shut the front door.

Wait. Tracee didn't tell you

That Ben stiller is subsidizing

The film?

[Ding!]


Um, anyway, what I wanted to

Talk to you about was I would

Just love it if, you know, for

The rest of today, you could...

You could really try to stay

Focused because, you know, this

Really means a lot to me.

Aww, that's so sweet.

Thanks.

You know, it's like my one

Chance.

So exciting.

It is. It's very exciting.

And I think that you and I

Should, um, you know, be able to

Trust each other.

I took a weekend-long

Workshop on trust at an ashram

Upstate.

And action!

We're not even on set.

I'm walking, walking to set,

Walking on to a hot set.

What?

What's a hot set?

"The untitled green-lit"

Halley feiffer vehicle promo

"Trailer project."

Head of roll. Scene one. Apple.

Take one. Marker.


Everybody settle.

Here we go, and action!

Hey, Michael, you want...


[Breathing machine hisses]

All right.

Yeah, going again... sorry.

Yeah, we're going again.

Hey, Michael...


[Breathing machine hisses]

Cut, cut, cut!

Mnh-mnh.

Nope.

Uh, nurse Martha?

Can you...


Can you fix my mustache?

Yes, halley?

Hi. Um, can we unplug dad's

Breathing machine real quick?

It'll just be for, like, a

Second.

Uh...

Dad, is it okay with you?

No, uh, halley...

Dad?

No, no. It's fine.

We don't need to unplug the

Breathing machine.

Really?

Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

Why don't... just head back to

Set.

It's totally fine.

You're the boss.

All right.

Going again.

Can you move?

Can you... is everything

Okay?

Yes, Ryan.

It's not about you.

All right, going again.

"The untitled green-lit"

Halley feiffer vehicle porno...

Um, vehicle promo trailer

"Project."

Take two. Mark.

Here we go.

Very still, and action.

[Keyboard clacking]

Hey, Michael.

You want to try it in my butt

Again?

[With accent] Halley... No,

I don't.

We only have a couple weeks

Left to get this draft done.

Wait, no. Cut! Cut!

Ryan, why are you talking like

That?

[Normal voice] Because I

Did a little research.

Googled chernus.

He's eastern European... from

[With accent] Russia.

Chekhov, smirnoff, boleslavsky.

Wha... no, stop it!

You sound like an asshole!

Didn't you listen to

Austin Pendleton's dialect tapes

Like I told you to?

Aghh!

Michael, I can't do this,

Michael.

Hal... halley?

Yeah?

I can't do this. This is...

Stop it, Ryan!

This is horrible.

We have to stop now.

It's okay, halley.

Let's just keep going.

It sounds okay?

Yeah, it's fine.

Don't believe you.

Let's keep going, okay?

Let's keep going, okay?!

Okay! Don't have to yell.

Thank you, Michael.

Yeah.


Michael."

Here we go.

Yeah, can you just give me

One second?


Michael?

She's really thirsty.


All right.

I'm ready to go again.

Here we go.

Ready?

Yes. And... Action.

Hey, Michael.

You want to try it in my butt

Again?

Yep, so... i just did that.

Moving ahead.

Halley, please.

Moving ahead!

Um, you want to drunk-dial Ryan,

Cocksucker?


Yeah, that's really funny.

Cut, cut.

Tracee.

Could you go in there, please,

And smell her beer for me?

Yeah. Copy that.

No. I'm ready to go again.

Now.

All right. Flying in!

Stepping on to a hot set.

Wait. Tracee, what are you

Doing in this scene?

You come in later.

You're not in this scene.

You come later.

Yeah, I know.

I need your prop.

But why? I love my prop.

Yeah, I know you do, sweetie,

But I need to take it.

No.

I'm sorry, honey.

What? No!

Yes!

No!

Halley!

[Both arguing]

Stop it!

Aaah!


Jesus.

No, tra...

Ow! Ow! Ow!

[Audio feedback]

Ah, shit! Oh!

Halley, you hurt me!

Well, you hurt me every day!

Let's keep making the movie.

I am so good right now.

Halley.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

All right.

Everybody's here.

There's too many people.

I don't understand.

This is supposed to be a closed

Set, Michael.

Ryan.

Ryan. Babe, are you okay?

No, she really hurt me.

Tracee, give me some rosÃ©!

No, no, no. No rosÃ©.

No, no. What?

Oh, no.

Oh...


Ohhh.

Halley, come on!

[Electricity crackles]

Get it off! Get it off!

Something's burning!

Okay, cut.

It's not good at all.

Halley?

I love you guys.

Just a little bit right here.

Hola. Hello.

Bongiorno. Jambo.

My name is halley feiffer, and I

Am not an alcoholic.

I just really love drinking.

[Indistinct greetings]

Me es aquÃ­ pronto because I'm

Making a movie and my puta

Brother and his gay boyfriend

Said I have to come here if I

Want to keep being in the movie

So...

Oh, and since you're all

Wondering, that was me in

"The squid and the whale" so

Please respect my anonymity

Apropos of that.

Do you want a 24-hour coin?

Are they free?

Oh, yeah.

Oh, then definitely.



Okay.

We're passing this really

Slowly.

Thank you.


[Coins jingle]


Wha... Natasha lyonne?

Teen choice breakout star from

The "slums of Beverly hills"?

Uh, that's why it's

Anonymous.


I'm so sorry!

I will totally respect your

Anonymity apropos of your

"American pie" films.

All right.

Why don't we close out with a

Serenity prayer?

Pass those back.

Oh, I'll do whatever you say.

And I'm happy to hear about

Your dog.

Later.

Yeah, later.

Uh, you got a sponsor?

What? Oh, no.

I've never had sex with a woman.

Huh?

Sorry, I was just enchanted

By your voluminous eyelashes and

Impressive rÃ©sumÃ©.

What did you ask me?

Do you have a sponsor?

Um, oh! No.

I'm not really an alcoholic.

Yeah, well, you look like an

Alcoholic.

Listen, if you want somebody to

Talk to, you know, just to

Answer your questions, take you

Through the steps, I'd be happy

To work with you.

Really?

Yeah.

Or if you just want to go grab a

Drink or something, you know.

Hit me up. Just kidding.

I don't drink anymore.

Anyway, here's my number.

Is this your agent's number?

No, it's my cellphone number.

Think you can smoke in here?

Uh...

Ehh.

Mmm.

Bye, guys!

Keep coming back!


I'm talking to you.

Oh, my God, Ryan.

This 12-step thing is so

Awesome.

I totally got Natasha lyonne

From "but I'm a cheerleader" to

Be my sponsor!

I'm gonna go to every meeting in

Town and find my entire cast.

'Kay, bye!


[Brakes squeak]

[Engine shuts off]

Oh, God, no.

Aaah!

Ah! Oh, my Buddha!

Aah! Aah! Aah!

This isn't happening.

Ben! Ben!

Big hug, big hug.


Ben!

Remember me from Broadway?

Remember me from Broadway?

Hi, Haley.

Oh, it's halley, but you can

Call me whatever you want.

How are you?

What are you doing?

You look so good.

You look so tan.

Were you in Hawaii?

I know you have a house there.

Was it nice?

Did you go snorkeling?

Anyway, how are you?

What are you doing?

Are you on your way to a

Meeting?

Like a big movie meeting?

What are you meeting about,

"Greenberg 2"?

Do you need someone to fill in

The greta gerwig role?

She's so hot right now.

Oh, my God.

I'm obviously so jealous of her,

But just trying to be nice.

Can you go?

Oh, yeah.

Bye.

Bye. Oh, no, no! Wait!

Just roll down the window really

Quick!

Really, really quick!

What?

It means a lot that you're

Talking to me because I really

Thought you would never speak to

Me again after I asked you to

Throw your hot dog down my

Hallway.

Sorry, sorry, sorry.


Wha...

I can't do this.

You're too upsetting to me.

Don't...

Hmm. Muscles.


Oh!

No, this hurts a little bit, but

In a good way... in a good way.

Anyway, I just wanted to say

Thank you so much for funding my

Film.

It's gonna kick ass at

Sanddunes.


Uh-huh. What film?

What film? Hello!

"The untitled green-lit"

Halley feiffer vehicle promo

Trailer project"?

You're the executive producer.

Tracee was swiping your cards

Yesterday like precious at a

Kfc, and we just thank you so

Much.

We could not have done it

Without you.

Beep! [Laughs]

Got your nose.

So cute.

Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry.

Wait a minute, tracee?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tracee.

Tracee.

Yeah, tracee.

You know tracee.

I fired tracee two days ago.

You fired tracee.

Yeah.

I don't understand.

She stole from me.


Freak show.

Of all the streets in New York.

[Bell dings]

Grr!


Tracee!

Get your fat-ass, sorry-ass ass

Face down here!

Halley?

I need to talk to you a mano

Our mano!

Okay, hold on to your

Chihuahuas.

I'll be right down.

Hi, halley.

How are you?

Wow. You look really pretty.

I know I do.

Now shut your bloated face and

Listen carefully to the words

Spilling from my silvery lips.

You...

Are...

A...

Genius.

[Exhales deeply]

I thought you were mad at me!

How could little old me be

Mad at such a ravishing acorn?

You secured funding for my film

By extortionating Ben stiller.

I have never seen such

Ingenuity... such

Resourcefulness...

Huh?

Such resolve.

Ah!

The word "no" does not exist

In your dojo.

Ahh.

Mmm.

Tastes like a fairy do.

You made this film a priority

Against all odds.

You set your eyes on the prize,

And you didn't let go until the

Fat lady sang, and you don't

Even know how to sing.


Mmm!

Cupcakes.

[Both gasp]

Hollywood? Ha ha!

More like halleywood.

Ah!

And it's all thanks to you.

I'm gonna teach you well,

Grasshopper.

Can we go upstairs?

Oh, I can't.

I just can't.

Oh, yes.

I can't. I just...

Yes. Oui.

Ohh! Yes!

I can't!

[Both screaming]

[Baby cries]

[Camera shutter clicks]

[Screaming continues]

[Door closes]

You want some coffee?

Um, do you have half and

Half?

No, just almond milk.

That's fine. Two splendas.

So Michael and Ryan say we

Can't resume principal

Photography unless you stop

Drinking.

Did it. On it. Love it.

Natasha lyonne's my sponsor.

Next!

[Glasses clink]

Tasha? Really?

She was sparkling in the

Ephron sisters'

"Love, loss, and what I wore"

Off-Broadway.

Do you think she'd be willing to

Do our movie?

On it... totally on the

Burner.

As soon as I finish my four-step

Inventory, I'm totes gonna ask

Her to make a special cameo

Appearance.

Well, snap, snap, girlfriend,

Because we have to start

Shooting this kitten wagon

Before stiller lawyers up and

Presses charges.

Could we kidnap him?

Brills.

We only have a little less than

A week to finish the trailer,

Edit it, and get that bitch

Postmarked and in the mail for

The sanddunes peeps in L.A.

Ugh. And I have to shoot it

With Ryan?

Actually, I have a little

Surprise stewing on the stove

For you.

Just give me one hot sec.

Hmm.

Uh! Driver!

This is good.

[Clears throat]

Okay.

[Door opens, closes]

Um, sir?

I'm just gonna hang in here

While she runs out and grabs

Something real quick, if that's

Cool?

You can keep the meter running.

Yeah, yeah.

That's fine, fine.

Take your time, come on.


Where are you from?

Pakistan.

Hot.

I was a doctor back home, you

Know.

Okay, could you stop

Bragging?

It makes me uncomfortable.

Hey, this is Jesse.

Uh, leave a message.

I'll get back to you as soon as

Possible.

Thanks.


Hey, Jesse.

It's halley again.

I was hoping to catch you on the

Phone so I wouldn't have to tell

You in a message, but, um, I

Wrote a script, and it looks

Like Ben stiller is producing

It.


So that's very exciting.

Oh! Gotta run.

We have a meeting with stiller

Right now.

Okay.

Oh! Oh!

[Muffled yelling]

Shh! Shh! Shhh!

Okay, we're all set.

Just take us back home now,

Please.

Thank you.

Back home.


[Indistinct shouting]

So, what's this bubbling

Surprise about?

Ooh!

It turns out macchio loves

Freckly blondes with impressive

Family pedigrees.

[Indistinct shouting]

So he's agreed to meet with you

For a half-hour about the movie

Tonight!


Ugh!

Ow! Ow!

Ohhh, okay.

Let me go!

Shh! Shh!

There, there, stiller.

There, there.

Tracee!

Tracee, you're fired...

Again!

I know.

Bitch.

I will end you!

All right, so, tracee,

When/where is this macchio

Meeting to occur?

Your pad. 7:00 tonight.

I gave him the addy.

Perf!

You have to seal the deal.


Thank God I just got my cootchie

Vajazzled.

[Muffled grunting]

Oh! I forgot!

I per diem-ed this bottle of

Champagne for you for tonight.

Oh, but, tracee, remember, I

Can't drink anymore.


You can deal with your drinking

Problem anytime, but the

Deadline for the screenwriter's

Lab is in a week, so get your

Priorities straight.

[Grunting continues]

I hate you guys!

Well, what do we do about

Ryan?

Oh, he will be so happy that

We got Daniel-San to be in your

Film.

He will totes sacrifice his role

For something so vital.

I'm powerful, and I will end

You!


Totes. "Migotes."

Halley, I'm gonna smack the

Freckles off your stupid face.

* put it in, pull it out *

Wow.

Wax on, wax off.

Wax on, wax off.

Let me know if you need a

Hand with that wax.

Konnichiwa, sensei macchio.

Um, I-i-i have a question for

You.

I have both reservoir tip and

Non, if that's what you're

Asking.

It's noted.

But what I wanted to know, is it

Cool if my scene partner from

Austin Pendleton's acting class

Sits on your couch while we have

Our meeting?

You see, we're working on... on

"Streetcar," and I couldn't find

A Starbucks in this area, so

I...

Is that cool?


Your scene part... oh.

Is that cool?

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Of course.

Great.

Yeah. It can be a party.

Hi.

I'm mamie.

This is halley feiffer.

Oh.

Halley feiffer.

You're Jesse eisenberg's friend.

Oh, my God.

He loves you. [Laughs]

He speaks so highly of you.

We... we were just potlucking on

The vineyard.

Hi.

Ah.

I love your outfit.

It's so fun.

So fun.

Are you...

Is it, like, a costume party or

Something?

Yeah.

Well, Jesse really wouldn't

Stop talking about halley while

We were snapping lobster claws.

He thinks she's awesome.

You should totally do her movie.

Well, what's the part?

You'd play my boyfriend.

Nice.

Do we get to have sex?

Oh! Ralph!


Listen, I need to know what to

Tell my wife when I bring home

An std, you know?

I'm just... I'm just kidding.

He's so bad.

So bad.

Hey, you like me that way.

'Cause you're my blanche, and I

Will... Take you sexually.

Stanley. Stanley.

[Southern accent] But,

Stanley, you're my husband.

[Normal voice] I was just

Being Stella.

Both: Oh.


Listen, uh, what's, uh, what are

You shooting?

What is it?

Just a short film or...?

Very short.

Well, mamie has great taste.

We all enjoy the talents of a

Dead, gay writer, so, uh, before

We hold you up from your costume

Party, why don't you give me the

Script?


One second.

She's adorable.

She's funny.

Ooh. Look at that.

Okay.

[Bells jingle]


It's my screen...

Wow.

Flashy.


I'll give it a read.

I promise.

Great.

Right away.

It was really nice to meet

You.

Finally.


Have fun at your party.

I'll see you.

She's really talented.

And hot.

Did you see those legs?



Come on.

[Door closes]

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.


[Birds chirping]

[Indistinct conversations]

Good morning.

Good morning, Sean.

What a beautiful day.

Oh, bye, dad.

Thanks for making yourself

Scarce.

Good morning, everyone.

I've arrived.

Ah.

I love an early call time.

Good job, you.

Can't wait to start shooting.

* daddy issues *

* daddy, daddy, daddy *

* oh, daddy issues *

* boys call me crazy and I don't

Know why *

* daddy issues *

* daddy issues *

* I am the apple of my daddy's

Eye *

* daddy issues *

Ow.

Um, guys, where's tracee?

Doesn't she know she's in the

Scene?

She's not picking up her

Phone.

Does anyone have eyes on our

Director?


I hate tracee.

All right. You know what?

That's okay.

I know a better actress who's

Much prettier and famouser.

[Cellphone rings]

Oh, hi, Natasha. Natasha lyonne.

Hi. It's halley.

Are you busy right now?

Oh, you are? Um...

Oh, no, no, no.

I'm fine.

It's just... oh...

[Fake sniffling]

[Voice breaking] I'm going

Through a really rough time, and

I might...

I might drink.


Oh, really?

Oh, thank you so much.

Um, I'll text you the addy.

Okay, great.

Thank you so much.

Morning, halley.

Oh.

Oh.

You seem rested and... and

Perky.

Oh, you know, it's just one

Day at a time.

Wow.

Your 24-hour coin.

I'm gonna get enough to give

One to each and every member of

This fantastic crew.

That's so awesome, halley.

And I just called Juilliard to

Tell them I am not going to be

Returning this fall.

I think this movie is truly a

Game-changer for us both.

Yay.

Yay.

Hey, guys, uh, we got to skip

To the bedroom scene because

Tracee's not here.

So, could you just get dressed

For that, please, halley?

Uh, sure.

Can we wait like an hour?

No, we cannot wait an hour.

You need to get dressed right

Now.

[Radio chatter]

Oh, my God. That mustache.

Do you want to touch it?

No.

Director's headed to set.

Ugh.

Come on, macchio.

[Both moaning]


[With accent] Oh, yes.

Yes.

Are you fully erect?

Yes.

Your penis feels really

Small.

Halley!

Ugh! Ryan!

I cannot act with you if you're

Talking in that stupid voice!

[Normal voice] Could you

Just not tell me how to

Interrupt my character?

Michael urie is the director,

Not you.

Halley.

What?

Stop telling Ryan what to do.

Thank you!

Ryan, don't... don't do the

Accent.

See?

You don't need to decorate

Your performance.

Okay.

All right, guys. Focus.

Remember the given

Circumstances.

All right.

This is the last night of

Your relationship.

You love each other, but you're

Tearing each other apart.

Okay. Here we go.

[Both trilling, rambling]

Okay.

And action.

[Both moaning]

Are you fully erect?

Yeah.

Your penis feels really

Small.

Halley.

[Moaning continues]

What... wait.

Why is there somebody back

There?

Who is in the back...

Who is back there?

What the frick?

We're holding?

Uh... H-hold. Hold!

What...

Oh, shit.

I'm sorry.

Is that Ralph macchio?


Ralph?!

Aah! [Laughs]

Oh, my God!


My God!

Okay, uh, cut. Cut.

Holding. Holding.

Um, class...

This is Ralph macchio.


You might remember this teen

Dream from such blockbusters as

"My cousin vinny,"

"The karate kid," and

"The outsiders," in which he

Played a young, cretinous yo-yo.

Um, master macchio, this is

Team feiffer.

Go, team!

Hey, everyone.

Hi, Ralph.

Hi.

Uh, can I get some sides?

Oh! Yeah! Yeah!

Here, um, um, here are Ryan's

Sides.

Thanks.

What are you doing, halley?

Well, Ryan...

He's Ralph macchio.

I mean, let's call a spade a

Spade.

Oh, Ryan.


I don't understand why you're so

Upset about this.

I mean, he's Ralph macchio.

He's famous, so he's our real

Star, and... You're not famous,

So you're worth nothing.

Wait, what?

Wait. What... what's going on?

Technical difficulties.

Holding.

Halley.

Holding.


Babe, just don't waste your

Breath.

She's not worth it.

She's clearly mentally ill.

Okay, alcoholics are the

Elite of the mentally ill.

Hey.

The gay guy from "ugly Betty."

I worked with you.

Hi, Ralph.

I can't believe that I

Trusted you.

I worked really hard on this.

This was gonna be our chance.

My one chance.

Oh, Ryan.

You can't make an omelet if you

Don't even have a chicken.

And one day, you will be a

Chicken.

I can promise you that.

But right now, you're more like

A tiny, preemie, chickety

Thingie that was ripped out of

The uterus of a raped preteen

Chicken who shouldn't have been

Having a baby anyway.

I can be a chicken.

Babe, babe, don't waste your

Breath.

Just let it g...

Oh, no, Michael!

Where are you going?

We have a movie to make.

I mean, I scored Ralph macchio.

I scored a bona fide teen

Heartthrob.

Halley.

Celebrities don't make a movie

Great.

Heart is what makes a movie

Great.

And you have no heart.



I'm sorry, everybody, but that's

It.

Sorry for wasting your time, but

You can go ahead and pack it up.

This movie's wrapped.

What?

Yeah.

Wrapped?

No. Wait...

No, guys, that's fine, because

We still have Ralph macchio, so

I'll just make my movie with

Ralph!

Right, Ralph?

I will snap you in half.

Did you ever see

"The karate kid"?

I mean, all the action

Sequences?

Just like that.

Just like... huh?

You know what?

This is all tracee's fault!

She's the one ruining this

Movie, not me!

It was her idea to replace Ryan

With Ralph macchio!

Halley!


Tracee.

No, tracee, i...

No! [Sobs]

All right, well...


I was in

"The squid and the whale."

* hushabye *

* now it's time

To close your little eyes *

* I apologize

If I forgot to say good night *

* it's dreamy time *

* and we can find a brand-new

Paradise *

* where everyone is nice *

* and we can fly *

What?

Ugh.

Halley.

Halley.

Huh.

Natasha?


So, I guess you drank.

Oh, my God.

Nata... i... whoa.

I can't even believe you're

Here.

Thank God.

Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

Do you think you can

Convincingly portray the role of

My ex-boyfriend Michael chernus

In my movie?

Let's put this barleycorn

Down.

Why don't we go downstairs and

Natasha, I don't have time

For coffee.

The sanddunes screenwriters lab

Deadline is in three days.

All right.

Put the screenwriters lab on the

Back burner for a second.

If you don't want coffee, we can

Get you a nice green juice

Maybe, kale smoothie...

Pffft!

Kale smoothie?

Spinach with lemon ginger,

Some cayenne pepper.

I don't think so.

I think I'd rather die.

Yeah, well, if you keep this

Shit up, you might die!

What are you...

Natasha, I don't have a drinking

Problem!


I went to your 12-step

Meeting, and you guys were

Really, really nice.

It's a little boring.

And now my break from drinking

Is done, and I'm fine.

Obviously. Look.


I'm drinking.

Nothing's happening.

So, thank you so much for your

Help.

But just because you can't drink

Anymore doesn't mean that I

Can't, okay?

Is this how you drink?

Do you want to smell the

Bottle?

Get that shit away from me.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

Hey.

Back in the '90s, I was supposed

To be the Sundance kid, but I

Was too boozed up.

That's you!

I'm different and younger!

We were all younger.

Hey, if you want my help, you

Know where to find me.

If not, good luck, all right?

Oh, break a leg!

What? Is this a fucking

Important movie?

No, nata... okay, Natasha.

Come on, Natasha.

Natasha.

Oh, fuck!

Ow.

Yeah?

I need help.

That's a start.

It's gonna be all right.

Thank you.

Okay.

* we'll be starstruck and

Sunblind *

* cocksure and tongue-tied *

* as we fly by, they'll cry out

"Won't you please be mine?" *

* hushabye *

* never mind the bad things in

Your life *


* here's your lullaby,

Honey *

I'm sorry.

Oh, God, Ryan, I'm so, so sorry.

I never should have replaced you

With Ralph macchio.

I love you so much.

I think you're so talented.

Um, I've spent the last 12 hours

In 12-step meetings, and I've

Actually stayed.

I've actually listened.

And I really want to change.

I really want to try to stop

Drinking.

A day at a time.

Oh, God.

I'm proud of you.


Thank you.

Thank you.

Um...

When you come with me to

Los Angeles, we can make a pitch

To the sanddunes people and

Convince them in person as a

Team to make our film.

Our film?

Yeah.

Our.

Bagel?

Oh, no carbs.

I'm a movie star now.

You're so cute.

All right. Let's start packing.

Like, right now?

Yeah, we got to go.

The deadline's in like eight

Hours.

Okay. [Laughs]

Really?

Yeah, I'm not fucking around.

Here. Let me take that.

[Airplane passes over]

Okay.

Okay. Okay.

Here's the elevator.

Okay. Press it. Press it.

Come on.

This is taking so long.

It's okay, Ryan.

It's okay. We can wait.

It's okay. It's okay.

Come on!

This is taking so long!

Okay, let's go, let's go,

Let's go!

[Fast-forward speaking]

[Keys clacking]

[Telephone rings]

Can you hold the door?

Hold the door! Hold the door!

Get out of the way.

Okay, I need a break.

Okay. Let's take a break.

Oh!

I'm so tired.

I'm so tired.

Are you okay?

Are you okay?

Oh, Ryan. Ryan.

I think that's sanddunes.

I think it's right there.

Where?

Ryan, right there.

Okay, let's go.

Let's go.

All right. Go. Go.

Let's go.

Can you hold the door?

Hold the door! Hold the door!

Hold the door.

Go, go.

I'm gonna leave my suitcase.

Okay.

Leave it.

Hi. Hi.

Oh!

I need water.

No, no time for water. Hi.

Are you guys okay?

Yeah.

We're here to see the... the

President of the sanddunes

Institute screenwriters lab of

The sanddunes institute.

For?

We have an idea.

What are you talking about?

I was...

She was in

"The squid and the whale"!

"The squid and the whale"?

Noah baumbach's cinematic

Masterpiece?

Ring-a-ding-ding-dong.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I-I didn't recognize you on all

Fours.

Um, Jesse will be so excited to

See you.

Jesse?

Jesse eisenberg.

He's our guest celebrity judge

This year.

[Door opens]


Halley?

Oh, God.

Jesse.

It's like seeing an angel.

[Both panting]

Come on.

I hate it when you talk to me

Like that.

I love it when you tell me

That you hate things that I do.

Okay, all right, why don't

You guys get up off the floor?

No, we like being on the

Floor because it shows our

Deference to you.


Jesus Christ. Okay.

Okay.

Oh. Hey.

It's fun down here, right?

Right. Right.

Yeah, how you doing, Ryan?

Hey, Jesse.

It's really great to see you.

You look handsome.

Thanks.

So, what are you guys even doing

Here?

And I'm sorry I never returned

Your calls.

It's just, your messages kind of

Freaked me out.

I know, and I'm so sorry.

I freak myself out.


I call you drunk, and I make

Up these stories about how great

I'm doing and...

I just want you to think I'm

Cool.

And obviously, you know, I

Haven't been that cool.

But I really am trying to

Change.

And part of that change is

Taking my life into my own

Hands.

Please let us pitch our movie

Idea for you.

I don't know.

Please?

Please, please, please.

Please?

Please, please, please.

Please?

Yeah, please?

Please?

All right. What the hell.

It's five minutes.

Aah!

Oh, thank you, Jesse!

They legalized gay marriage,

Jesse!

Okay, now, do you have a

Flamethrower, three tea cups,

And an accompanist?

Yeah, and three tea cups?


No, we don't have tea cups.

That is fine.

We will do it a capella.

Okay.

Do you want to loosen up?

Yeah, yeah.

All right.

Here we go.

Okay.

Okay, I'm gonna drop you

Down, ready?

Get down on your knees.

Okay.

Okay, I'm gonna push your

Head.

Push it in.

All right.

[Both groan]

Okay.

And a-five, and a-six, and

A-five, six, seven, eight.

Both: * we wrote a movie

Starring both of us *

* it's amazing *

* I play me *

* and I'm Michael chernus *

Both: * there's a foot cam

And anal *

* b-u-u-u-u-u-t *

In comes Ralph macchio *

Oh.

That's a wrap!

[Notes play]

Both: * then it's dramatic *

Natasha lyonne *

* Jesse, so sorry for

Drunk-dialing your phone *

Throw us a bone *

[Notes play]

Bang!

Okay, that's it.

Aah! [Laughs] Thank you!

Thank you, guys.

Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you.


Thank you. Thank you.


I'm completely confused here.

Um...

Yeah, me, too.

I'm not sure what it is you

Want.

I mean, I don't mean to be

Dense, but what... what is the

Movie idea?

I don't... i don't get it.

Um... I got it.

Yeah, it's basically about...

A girl in the ballet, and she

Has to play two different kinds

Of swans, and one is really nice

And sweet, and the other's very

Dark and sexy.

And how does she play both,

Basically.

Halley...

Okay, you're right.


That song has nothing to do with

Our movie idea.

No, Ryan's right.

Yeah.

Oh, my God.

Yeah, my whole life I've just

Been trying to do the least

Amount of work possible.

Trying to trick people into

Giving me things I don't

Deserve.

Do you want to talk to her?

Yeah.

Um, again, I don't mean to be

Obtuse, but I think we're

Probably all just wondering.

What... what is the movie?

We don't know.

We don't know.

We have no idea.

Yeah.

We're totally unprepared for

This meeting, and it really

Breaks my heart because I have

[Voice breaking] Dreamed about

This moment my whole life.

You know what, Ryan?

It's okay.

Let's go.

We finally have humility.

Uh, okay. Goodbye.

Halley, thanks a lot.

Bye, Ryan.

Have a good flight.

So, that's it?

Yeah, you're not gonna try to

Stop us?

Oh, no, I think we've got it.

Yeah.

Yeah. Thank you.

I'm not sure exactly what we

Got.

Jesse.


Sorry.

I'm... I'm not really sure what

It is you want us to say.

I don't know.

Don't forget your keyboard

Application.

Ryan.

I don't know.

Bye. Good luck.

Great energy.

Hey, guys.

Hey, wait up.

Listen, before you go, for

Whatever it's worth, you both

Seem to have such a unique

Connection, and I think maybe if

You looked into that, you might

Have an interesting story.

Whoa. Whoa. Okay.

Oh. All right.

Okay. Thanks, guys.

Whoa, thank you, Ryan.

Thank you, Jesse.

Thanks. Okay.

Thank you so much.

Really, it's time to go now.

Oh, come on.

Shut up, Facebook.

That's cute. Thank you. Okay.

Thanks.

No, no. Don't do that.

Oh.

Okay. Thanks. Okay.

Hey, halley, come here for a

Second.

I still think you're cool, okay?

All right.


Now get out of here, scamp.

So, Michael chernus, the last

Part of my ninth-step amends is

Something that is really, really

Difficult to tell you.

A year ago, i... Violated your

Privacy in a major way by, um,

Turning the intimate details of

Our life together into a 10-page

Screenplay and five-minute

Teaser trailer.


Betraying your trust this way.

My living amends to you is my

Sobriety.

In my sobriety, I will work

Every day to treat you with

Respect and dignity.

Okay, wait. Hold on.

You what?

That's what your movie was?


Huh.

Well, you certainly did a lot of

Fucked-up things.

And I've spent a lot of time

Being angry with you.

But...

After we broke up, I decided to

Make a lot of changes in my

Life, too.

I, uh, I cleaned up my act.

I got my own place.

And I'm learning to let go of my

Anger.

I love you.

Always have.

Huh.

I know that it took guts to

Apologize like you just did.

I've never seen that in you

Before.

Well, I have never seen that

In you before.

What?

Your chin!


Your chin.


'Cause you shaved.

'Cause you...

Because I shaved. Yeah.

I never saw the... yeah.

Because there was...

There was hair there.

Yeah. Uh-huh.

That's funny.

It was a joke that...

It was funny.

You just didn't get it.

Want to go get a froyo before

Your big night?

Yeah.

Yeah?

Totes.

I totally do.

Okay.

Come on, you.


You didn't really like that

Joke?

You tell a joke?

I thought you quit that.

Just 'cause you don't drink

Doesn't mean you can't like

Jokes.

[Camera shutters clicking]

All right, you got this.

[Cheers and applause]


Aww!

Aww.


Ryan, my genius brother, will

You help me make my movie?

Yes.


So, Ryan has to ask you a

Dire straits question, right,

Halley and I have been

Working on a new screenplay

Idea.

It's more like a comment on real

Life.

Would you be into directing it?

Yes.


"The untitled green-lit"

Halley feiffer vehicle promo

"Trailer project."

I'm ready to go again. Now.

All right, guys. Focus.

Focus.

Wow.

Yeah, halley, I need to take

Your...

What? No!

Tracee, no!

Aah!


Whoopsie Daisy.

Yeah, you were such an idiot.

I remember.

Get me some more rosÃ©.

Aah!

No. Cut.

That's a wrap.

This movie's over.

You can pack up your gear and

Take off.

We're done here.

What? Michael! No!

[Slow evil laughter,

[Thunder rumbles]

[Glasses clinking]


[Cork pops]




We wanted to make it more

Like "capturing the friedmans,"

So we added some mysterious

Eroticism.

* sometimes the sun goes

'Round the moon *

* I see the passion in your

Eyes *

* sometimes it's all a big

Surprise *

Mom?

Ryan, uh, why you calling me

Mom?

I'm really worried about my

Feelings towards halley.

I think they turned sexual.

Ryan, who's halley?

[Fake sobs]

And where's Michael?


Mommy.

What's that thing in my face?

Get that camera out of my face!

Aah! That's Vanessa Williams!

* ...You're looking for *

* it's the one thing you can't

See *


Children!

It is I, world-famous satirist

Jules feiffer!

Hey, dad.

Hey, dad.

Hi.

What are you doing?

This is incest, the last taboo.

You are besmirching the feiffer

Kingdom.

You two should kill yourselves.

He's really good, isn't he?

You two should kill

Yourselves!


Not her fault.

[Both sobbing]

[Gun cocks]





Oh, yeah.

Oh, my God.

[Gun cocks]


[Both cheering]

Oh, we worked so hard.

We're so awesome!

It was so good!

Yes, we are!

We're so good!

We're so good!

Yes, yes, yes, yes!

Both: Us! Us! Us! Us! Us! Us!

Us! Us! Us! Us!

I love us so much.

You are so vital.

* hey, my vagina is eight

Miles wide *

* absolutely everyone can come

Inside *

* if you're ever frightened... *

I'm Michael ausiello for

Tvline.Com.

We're here at the premiere of

"Capturing the feiffers."


Let's get their reaction.

Hi. How was the movie?

Don't want to [Bleep] talk

About it!

Hi. How was the movie?

Your reaction to the movie?

[Speaks foreign language]

Hey, what did you think of

The movie?

I'm gonna throw up.

Oh.

What did you think of the movie?

Guys are [Bleep] sick!

Reaction to the movie?

Um...

Reaction to the movie?

No.

Hi. Reaction to the movie.
