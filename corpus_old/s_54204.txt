protection we needed.

You win some, you lose some.

But you live...

You live to fight another day.

You think you're a man
with that gun in your hand,

don't you?

I'm a man without it.

Put the gun down.

(Puts gun down)

Put up your dukes.

Now you're a man.

Your uncle picked up a gun too.

He had to find out
the hard way.

22 years old.

You got a choice.

These are all you need.

Alright?

What's up, man?

What's up, Red?

Ah ah ah! Get your ass up.

Take your ass home.

I'm not scared of you.

All these niggers around here

might be scared of you,
but I'm not.

You take your ass home.

No, fuck you.

You're lucky I'm not a man.

Otherwise l'd kick

Shut up!

Deebo, man, you trippin'.

What you say, little nigger?

Man, that's a female.

Shut your little

Put the gun down, son.

DEEBO: Huh?

Put the gun down, son.

Yeah. Put that gun down, son,

This was all the protection

You win some, you lose some.

But you live...

That's right.

(PHONE RINGS)

CRAIG: Hello?

JOI: Why you can't
call nobody back?

Which one of your hos

has somebody
shooting at you?

I don't know why
I waste my time

on your old
stupid ass anyway.

I don't know either.

It's over. Bitch!

(DIAL TONE)

Yeah, I got your money,

and I don't appreciate

you sending your punk ass,buster
ass, jheri curl ass friends

to shoot at me and my homie.

They liked to got dealt with.

Don't be calling here like you
some straight up "g",

'cause I'll cut your balls off

and hand them to you, partner.

I had to warn you too many times
about my money, Smokey.

It's the principle
of the whole thing.

There's principalities
in this.

Well, yeah. I got
your money anyway,

and you sell that shit
yourself next time

'cause I'm going to rehab.

I'm through with this shit.

I was just bullshittin',
and you know this, man.

RAP SONG:
# You know it ain't no stopping

# All the dogs I'm dropping

# It's Friday night,
so everything is popping

# I got spin
that's been on the head

# So let the games begin

# Yakety yak, don't talk back,
go to a song

# Calling up earl
on the car phone

# Mac 10
just got out of court

# Roaming through the hood
in a super sport

# Bumper too short

# 18's got the rear view
mirror's vibrating

# And deep dish dating

# You know how we do it,
ain't nothing to it

# But the floss of the crowd,
Harris & Ross

# 'Cause if you fuck with ours,
we leave scars

# On a "g" right course,
living like stars

# Might hit the highway
on the Vegas run

# Fool, 'cause it's Friday

# Oh, yeah, throw
your neighbourhood in the air

# If you don't care

# Oh, yeah, throw
your neighbourhood in the air

# If you don't care

# Standing outside
on the Friday

# Living on the edge

# 'Cause we all
got them hard heads

# It seems like we all away

# For the drive-by,
playing tag with Satan

# But we chillin',
yeah, we ready and willin'

# You hear about
the latest west side killing?

# But we slippin', say trippin'

# For dipping, pistol gripping,
never slipping

# Big g's
trying to hang out

# But old "g" said, take
your little ass in the house

# My big homie just got out

# Used to be damned,
now we just crack dead

# He's about
as hard as Darth Vader

# In his sweatshirt,
khakis, and chuck taylors

# Just seen them
in the driveway

# Getting beat like a smoker,
fool, 'cause it's Friday

# Oh, yeah, throw
your neighbourhood in the air

# If you don't care

# Oh, yeah, throw
your neighbourhood in the air

# If you don't care, fool

# Why must I be like that
and chase the cat?

# Or settle for a hood rack?

# Do be brave

# No dreadlocks flying
in and out of town

# With half a chicken
and a cock

# And I love her

# 'Cause she dared
to fuck around

# With the underground

# Pussy hound, and her ass
is big, round, and wide

# Jacked up,
making niggers down the rye

# Smoking in dope,
playing that super Nintendo

# Hear a rat-a-tat
on my window

# There goes that
pelvic thrust

# Don't trust a rubber,
'cause it's bound to bust

# In the oven, in the nappy

# I had on 2, so I was happy

# 'Cause that HIV will
make your dick hang sideways

# And that ain't cool, fool,
'cause it's Friday

# Throw your neighbourhood
in the air, if you don't care

# Oh, yeah, throw
your neighbourhood in the air

# If you don't care. #
