<i>[subway train rattling]</i>

[faint music playing]

What the fuck is taking
so long, man?

God, this is taking forever!

Does anything fucking
work right anymore?

I got somewhere to be!
I got a meeting!

<i>[indistinct announcement
on PA]</i>


I'm just fucking with you.
I don't have anywhere to be.

I don't have a meeting.
I don't even have a job.

Hey, what about you there,
Miss Lonely Heart?

You got a job?

You remind me
a lot of my mother.

It's okay, I get it.

You're a sick puppy,
aren't you?

<i>[ethereal music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[breathing jerkily]


Something's not right.

[grunts softly]

Some kind of bug.
[exhales deeply]

Let's explore it.


True tactile displacement.

Experiencing
powerful resistive force.


[panting softly]

Experiencing haptic feedback
in the mouth.



[panting heavily]

Experiencing haptic feedback.

[cell phone ringing]

<i>Hey.
What are you doing?</i>

Working.
<i>On a Saturday night?</i>

What do you want, Mom?

<i>I just saw a mouse
in my living room.</i>

It's the heat.

<i>In the summer,
it's the heat.</i>

<i>In the winter, it's the cold.</i>

They always have
their reasons.

<i>Yep, I-I saw it crawling in
out of my vent.</i>

That's how they travel,
through vents.

It's like that movie "Alien."

<i>Yeah.
Well, I sealed the hole.</i>

He'll find another hole.

<i>Well, what, then,
set a trap?</i>

No, what if it gets trapped
in a place you can't find it

and then it sits there and rots
and stinks up the place?

<i>I'll just set the trap
somewhere I can reach it.</i>

What if it's a mouse
with a lot of fight in it

and it doesn't die right away
and it runs to a place

you can't find it
and it dies there?

<i>Oh, dear God.
How would you kill it?</i>

I'd shoot it,
cut off its head,

and stick it on the lawn.

<i>You always take things
too far, Jean.</i>

Make an example of it.

<i>This is why
you don't have a boyfriend.</i>

<i>I tell all my friends
it's because you're so smart.</i>

<i>Men don't like smart women.
I would know.</i>

That's not the reason
I don't have a boyfriend, Mom.

<i>You need to get out more.</i>

<i>Working from home
is no way to live.</i>

Well, maybe by the time
I finish my work,

your girlfriends
won't have to rely

on their drunk,
abusive husbands anymore.

Maybe neither will you.

<i>That's enough.</i>

I got to go, Mom.

<i>You know, I just read
an interesting article online.</i>

<i>It says it's not too late
for women over 35</i>

<i>who are thinking
about freezing their eggs.</i>

<i>It's very mainstream now,
especially in your industry.</i>

<i>[music playing faintly

I'm just fucking with you.
I don't have a meeting.

I don't even have a job.

What about you there,
Miss Lonely Heart?

You got a job?

You remind me
a lot of my mother.

It's okay.
I get it.

You're a sick puppy,
aren't you?

I'm a sick puppy, too.

That's why I'm gonna spare you,

even though you are
pretty fucking ungrateful.

Hey, guess what.

I'm so fucking full of love,
I feel like I'm...

[gasps, screams]

<i>[ethereal music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>I keep having
this recurring dream.</i>

I'm a fetus in the womb.

I've got a sword
and a dog named Ringo,

like Toto from...

"The Wizard of Oz"
or something.

[person chuckles]

And my mother is nine months
pregnant with me,

and she's trying to abort me...

like, stabbing herself
all over,

And... and Ringo's barking,
trying to get her to stop,

and I'm in the womb,
like, sword in hand,

skillfully defending myself,
and...

I escape from the womb...

and my mother...

she's dead.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

And then I wake up.


You must have been Ringo.

[train bell chimes]

[train whooshing]


So when do you have
to bring this in?

They want me to put it
on tape for tomorrow.

What's your point of view?
[sighs]

What are you coming in with?

I mean...

Like, self-loathing,
self-hate, um...

No? No?

Self-hate...

needs to be fuller.

It's a mother-daughter
story moment.

I know you understand that.

I know you do.

You're just
not connected to it.

Yeah, I thought I was.
Mm-mm.

These aren't your words.

The words must be
like gasoline.

Say it like it will
set you on fire.

Say it like you have shit

in your mouth.

Do you understand?

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah, I think...
I think so.

Don't think.

Do.

[cell phone bloops]

[siren wailing,
horn blaring outside]

<i>Hi, you guys.</i>

<i>I'm so excited to be</i>

having the season finale
with you guys tonight.

We will be watching.
We'll be live-tweeting.

Thank you, thank you, thank you
so much for supporting us,

for loving on us,
for watching with us.

So tonight 9:00, 8:00 Central,
be there or be square.

Bam.

[breathes deeply]

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

[indistinct chatter,
traffic droning]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>I escape from the womb,</i>

and my mother...

She's dead,

and then I wake up.

You must have been Ringo.

Okay.

Was that weird?

Yeah, no,
it felt a little off, right?

I just don't want
to overstep, you know?

No, no, no, please.

I mean, it's not how
I would play it,

but that could just be me.

Okay, okay, um...

I just thought that,
you know, this is a difficult...

Mm-hmm.

A difficult conversation
for her to have,

and, you know, it's... it's hard
for her to talk about,

so I didn't want to go crazy.

I know.

And I mean,
it's... it's...

Her mom is trying to kill her,

but in the end,
she has to kill her mom.

I mean, that's...

It's horrible.

[subway train whooshing]

They have you reading
for the sister now?

Yep.

Everything okay?

Everything's fine.

You don't have to say
everything's fine

when it's not.

[breathes deeply]

Uh...

Soldiers,
when they get back from war,

then they have PTSD.

You ever wonder why?

Because there's no time
for feeling

when all you're trying to do
is not get shot.

You are dark-skinned...

Black woman in America.

Just right out of the gate,
you're at war,

trying to survive.

Are you saying
I have PTSD?

I'm saying for you
to get to this point,

you've overcome real pain.

But overcoming and dealing
is not the same thing.


When was the last time

you spoke to your mom?

We text.

You need to talk to her.

<i>â™ª He's a man â™ª</i>

<i>[Andrew Lloyd Webber's

<i>â™ª God, God, I'll never know â™ª</i>

[subway train whooshing,
screeching]

[muttering indistinctly,
grunts]

[breathes angrily]

You're beginning
to catch the anger,

but...
[exhaling angrily]

You need to go deeper.

What's underneath the anger?

Are you kidding me?
Mona...

your look,
it will get you into the room,

but your ability
to reveal yourself,

that will keep you there.

How can you even say
that to me, Wanda?

Mm-mm-mm, you need to live
in your pain.

Oh.

You need to live
in the trauma.

Look, don't, okay?
Don't.

Okay, Mona, Mona, hey...
just breathe.

You are fine.

This has nothing to do
with you personally.

This is not about
your sense of self

or your being
or your worth, even.

You just need to live
in the... look!

I am not your mother.

The casting director's
not your mother.

The director
is not your mother.

Do not get us confused.

You're not under attack.

[voice breaking]
I don't think

I can do this much longer.

Well, maybe you shouldn't.

Have you thought
about going back?

Being a minister again?

Mona.

[pounds on door]

What this world
has to offer you is temporary.

What Jehovah has
for us...

is forever.

Stop it.
Mm-mm.

I'm not gonna argue
with you, Mona.

Me neither.
We have a meeting tonight.

I am going to get prepared.
You are going to get ready.

Come with me, Mona.

Right.

Because God forbid

something conflicts with your
fucking meeting, right?

Okay, we're not gonna have
that type of language

in my house.
What, what's the problem?

Yes, Mom, I curse now!

Oh, and how does that
make you feel?

Great.
I am proud of it, yeah.

I am so proud, and I am done
trying to make you proud of me.

And how does that
make you feel?

Oh, it's great.

Is it great?
I'm a working actor now.

Oh, mm-hmm.
Yeah, on a big TV show.

You were!

Right.

But how would you know
since you refused to watch it?

Oh, I could barely watch
such a horrible show!

Well, it saved me from you.

Oh, come to meeting.

Your congregation praying and
crying for you to come back.

Do you hear yourself?

You always have
to be in control.

It always has to be your way.

Oh, sounds like
someone I know.

Even when it is your way,
okay?

Even when I give it to you!

You want me to be
in the full-time ministry,

I become a full-time minister.

That was not enough for you.
I am never enough for you!

I gave you everything!

I gave you everything
that I could possibly give you,

and now you still come to me
and say that wasn't enough?

What can I do?

You can love me.

You can love me.

You can love me, Mom.

Enough.
No, no!

You don't get to say enough!

You don't get to decide!


What do you want
from me, Mona?

Look at me.

Look at me.

Look at me!

My father chose another family,
and my mother chose God,

so what am I supposed to do?

How am I supposed
to walk in the world

when the two people
who are supposed to love me

choose something else?

Hmm?

[sobs softly]

I'm so sorry, Mona.

Oh, G...

Okay.
Okay.

Okay.

I think we're done here.

[chuckles softly]

<i>[hopeful music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[subway train whooshing,
screeching]

[indistinct chatter]

Just trying to be nice,
you know?

Sorry?

What the hell have you
ever been sorry for?

What the hell could you
possibly be so worried about?

You're wearing
a $10,000 Cartier watch.

I don't have anything
in common with you anyway.

What the fuck is taking
so long, man?

<i>[indistinct announcement
on PA]</i>

God damn!

Does anything fucking work
right anymore?

I got somewhere to be!
I got a meeting!

I'm just fucking with you.
I don't have a meeting.

I don't even have a job.

What about you,
Miss Lonely Heart?

You got a job?

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>I believe the money I make
belongs to me and my family,</i>

<i>not some mid-level
government bureaucrat.</i>

<i>This is America, okay?</i>

I think owning a gun
doesn't make me a bad person.

It makes me
a responsible parent,

and I think being
a minority or gay or whatever

doesn't make you
noble or a victim

or entitled to anything.

<i>Sorry.</i>

Okay.
<i>No, you know what?</i>

<i>I'm not sorry... there's nothing
wrong with what I'm saying.</i>

<i>There's something wrong
with people who think</i>

<i>there's something wrong
with what I'm saying,</i>

<i>and I'm not just gonna sit
here and let the sick liberal</i>

New York City school system
brainwash my kid

into thinking there's
something wrong with him

just because he's
a white "cisgender male."

No, fuck, no!

You're rambling.
Explain to me what happened.

Did I tell you
that one of his classmates

came out as being a lesbian?

Yeah, so what?
She's ten years old.

I mean, my kid has to come home
and ask me about things

he's not even old enough
to understand.

<i>I mean, they can't just stick
this shit in my kid's face.</i>

Did he hurt her?
<i>What? No.</i>

She just said that
he said something

that made her uncomfortable.

<i>What'd he say?</i>
Nothing.

He just repeated something
that some other kids had said,

something stupid
that some kid said.

I mean, kids say stupid things.
That's what kids do.

<i>Right, but what
was it he said?</i>

Nothing.
It was a separate incident.

It had nothing to do with it.

<i>There was more
than one incident?</i>

No, just two.

Why was he suspended, Ruth?

I don't really have
an answer, you know.

I don't... the principal
wouldn't tell us what happened.

<i>The other kid's parents
don't want it to be public.</i>

Well, what does Jared say
when you ask him what happened?

<i>He says they were just
horsing around.</i>

I don't know.
He doesn't really remember.

I mean, it's all been
extremely traumatic for him

and for me and David,
all of us.

It would be really nice
if you came over for lunch.

I got work to do.
It would mean a lot to Jared.

<i>Why do I always have
to come to you?</i>

Because you don't
have children.

All right,
it's an hour on the train

to get to you and an hour back.

That's two hours of my life
spent in a subway system

that is in total soul-crushing
disrepair and decline.

Uber... I'll pay for it.
<i>Thanks.</i>

I'd rather pay some mid-level
government bureaucrat.

Might put that money back
in the city and fix the train.

It would mean a lot to me.

[doorbell rings]

[dog barking]

<i>[uneasy music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Hi.
Hey.

Oh, hey, Mariah.
Hey, crazy girl.

Mariah Carey, the dog's name
is Mariah Carey.

I'm not calling her that.

You can't name a black
and white dog Mariah Carey.

It's an homage.
Come help me set up the table.

Shame he hung himself.

Poor guy.
What for?

He always struggled
with depression.

Depression?

She was sleeping
with half of France.

Come.
Hi, Gabe.

Hi, David.

[sighs deeply]
I can't.

What, what now?
Every day it's something new.

What happened?
Jared says... comes to me.

He says, "Mommy, did Daddy
make Black people into slaves?"

[laughs]
It's not funny.

It's actually
pretty depressing.

Well, what do you say
when he asks you that?

I tell him no,
Daddy did no such thing.

That's it?

What do you mean
that's it?

I tell him, "Don't listen to
what they teach you in school."

So then he says to me,
"Mommy, did I do something bad?

Did I do something bad
to the Blacks?"

And what do you say to that?

I tell him, of course, no,
he did nothing wrong.

He has nothing
to be ashamed of.

Yeah, but do you
explain to him

what he's really asking about,
the history?

What history?

You know what history
I'm talking about.

The one about how
the Great Society destroyed

the Black family...
that history?

Do I talk to him about
how before 1965,

when LBJ started subsidizing
single mothers,

the out-of-wedlock birth rate
among Black people in America

was at 20%
and that now it's at 70%?

Where do you get this shit?
I do talk to him about that.

You talk... you talk
about out-of-wedlock birth

with your ten-year-old?

I don't have to
defend myself.

I don't have a problem
with anyone, gay, Black.

I named my dog Mariah Carey
because I love Mariah Carey,

and I'm pretty sure my dog
is gay, and I love my dog.

What I have a problem with
is everyone telling me

how bad my son is, everything
that's wrong with him.

He's just...

he's hearing different things
in here and out there,

and... and that's clearly
confusing him.

That's causing him to lash out,

and... and that's alienating him
from people.

It is not my fault that right
now we're living in this moment

of groupthink social justice
fucking warrior mob nonsense.

Groupthink?

And that that's what
the school is teaching.

That is not my fault.

So he was suspended
from school for two days

because of groupthink?

Why do you have empathy
for everyone in the world

except for me?

Why do you care what I think?

Do you hate me?

Why would you say that?

If you think you have
all the answers,

why don't you go talk to him?

He's upstairs.

Just try to keep your agenda
out of it, okay?

Just try to make it about him?

<i>[gunshots on TV]</i>

I just landed in a ship,

and this guy
was, like, a snowman.

There's another one.
See, that's what it looks like.

And then... oh, that one.

Great, yes.

Too close, too close.

There's a guy up there.
There's a guy.

Hey, are you a pescatarian?

I am.

Why?

I just don't like
to eat meat.

How come you don't have
a girlfriend?

<i>[gunfire on TV]</i>

My mom says it's because
you don't have a job.

I think it's because
you're better than everyone.

You're a good kid, Jared.

That's not what my English
teacher says.

Yeah?

What does
your English teacher say?

My English teacher's
just terrible.

Why... why is your
English teacher terrible?

Just...

He's inappropriate,
very inappropriate.

In what way?
The way he acts.

How's he act?
He talks.

Like, it's weird...
whoa, whoa.

What... what's weird
about the way he talks?

He's, like, really gay.

Go, go.
Oh.

He sits with his,
like, legs crossed.

Oh!
I-I see.

Why's he have
to act like that?

Um...

Why does he have to stick
that in our faces? Gross.

Also, he's, like, Black, so
it's, you know, even weirder.

Hey.

Zone, zone, zone.
Zone, zone, zone!

Hey, Jared...
Behind these trees...

Jared.
What?

It's okay.
Where'd he go?

You can talk to me.
[sighs]

He sent me
to the principal's office.

Why'd he send you
to the principal's office?

He hates me.

Everyone at school hates me.

Why don't...
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.

Why don't you tell me
what happened?

I don't really remember.

Jared, what did you do?
I didn't do anything.

How do you know you
didn't do anything...

How do you know
you didn't do anything

if you don't remember
what happened?

Oh, someone's there!
Someone's there! Yes!

All right, all right, Jared.
Eliminated.

There's another guy behind me.
There's another guy.

Jared, look at me.

Don't hate me, Gabe.

Lunch is ready.

No!
He was right behind me.

Mom, he was right behind me.
I could have killed him!

I could have killed him!

So, Gabe,
what's new with you?

I'm making a documentary.

What about?
Police brutality.

Oh, boy.

Easy, now.

Can we maybe not talk
about politics for once?

Actually meeting
a regional organizer

for Black Lives Matter
tomorrow.

Oh.

How's that feel?

How's what feel?

Being
a cultural appropriator.

TouchÃ©.

See, this is what
your side loves to do.

You avoid dealing
with the message

by bullying the messenger.

Black Lives Matter
is a racist message.

All lives matter.

Yeah, Gabe, why don't you
make a movie about that?

Mariah Carey, no.

Can I make that one?
Yeah, might as well.

[dog barking]
It's just so adversarial,

as if our lives don't matter.

Hey, hey, hey!
Down!

Mariah Carey.
Mariah Carey, down, down.

No one's saying your life
doesn't matter, David.

It's just bad marketing.

Unarmed innocent people
keep getting killed by cops,

and you're talking
about marketing.

Who's innocent?
Oscar Grant was innocent.

Oscar Grant had a record,

illegal possession
of a handgun.

Don't tell me
these people are innocent.

He was shot in the back lying
facedown on a subway platform.

It was a freak accident.
Except it keeps happening.

Trayvon Martin was also
a freak accident?

Trayvon Martin
wasn't killed by a cop.

He was killed by an idiot.
Tamir Rice, Eric Garner...

Eric Garner is dead
because he was selling

untaxed cigarettes
and resisting arrest.

The guy was the size
of a Mack truck.

It took five cops
to restrain him.

How could anyone know
that he had asthma?

Because he was screaming,
"I can't breathe."

See,
even the marketing there,

the "I can't breathe" shirts,
it's just so accusatory,

pointing a finger at me

as if I was the one
who was choking him.

You keep...
Down.

You keep talking
about marketing.

Well, because it is marketing

that is driving the culture
wars in this country, Gabe.

We created the conditions
in these neighborhoods,

and then we send cops to them,

and you sit here and defend
them when they kill a kid

that could just as well
have been yours,

and that makes you complicit,
so yes, yes, David,

the marketing is pointing
a finger at you.

Okay, we didn't create
these conditions, Gabe.

We're Jewish.
We came from ghettos, too.

Jews enjoy the privileges
of being white.

Only in New York.

What's happening is that
people like you and the media

are using people like
Eric Garner,

isolated incidents,
to justify your agenda.

Freddie Gray
was an isolated incident?

Mike Brown was
an isolated incident?

Freddie Gray had a knife.

Mike Brown was fighting a cop
over control of a gun.

If you do that,
you might get shot.

12 times?
Unarmed kid shot 12 times?

Okay, relax.
Don't tell me to relax.

I just don't think that
you're appreciating

how difficult it is
to be a policeman

in these neighborhoods.
Try being Black in them.

Because you would know.

We know what it's like to be

part of a persecuted minority.

Yes, which is exactly why

we, of all people,
should understand.

Gabe, we picked ourselves up
as a people

because of strong family values

and a culture
that prioritizes education,

not because we said
our lives matter.

When these kids are
playing basketball,

my kid is doing his homework.

Okay, I don't even...
That's just racist.

Oh, my God, racist, really?
Racist... that's not racist.

First of all, there's nothing
wrong with playing basketball.

You're gonna play
the race card?

Second, you're not taking
into account the history.

There's your history,
and there's my history.

You're a numbers guy,
right, David?

Sure.

Kid born in
a poor neighborhood

with high levels of crime
is less likely to go to college

and more likely to end up
in jail or shot by a cop

than a kid born
in this neighborhood.

The Black people
who work for me,

they would be so annoyed
by this argument.

They're more likely to end up
in jail or shot by a cop

than a kid born
in this neighborhood,

than a kid born in this house.

That has nothing to do
with your family values.

That's... that's just math.

There's your math,
and there's my math.

No, there's not...
you can't have your own math,

your own history,
fucking alternative facts.

What's the point of even trying
to fucking talk about it?

Don't curse
in front of my kid.

Right, cursing,
because that's his problem.

What do you know
about problems?

You generate no income.
You're responsible to no one.

I have an income, but it's
not your kind of income.

I volunteer.

I'm responsible to people,
just not your kind of people.

Oh, we should put a statue
of you up in Central Park.

Why don't we knock down
the one of Christopher Columbus

and put one of you instead?

My teacher says

Christopher Columbus
was a bad man.

Your teacher's right.
Ignore your uncle.

Stop it.
He's my brother,

and I love him,
but he's a loser,

and these ideas
encourage him to be one.

I'd rather be a loser
than a bigot.

Go upstairs, Jared.

You should hear
some of the things

he was saying to me upstairs.

What do you mean?
What were you saying?

Seriously, what do you
have him reading, "Mein Kampf"?

Loser.
I'm a loser?

You talk about money

as if you've ever made any...
get a job.

I'm raising a child.
Raising a child is a job, Gabe.

Guys!

How does it feel, Gabe?

How does it feel to be
a complete disappointment?

Well, you didn't turn out

the way you were
supposed to either, so...

Is that why you don't
have a girlfriend?

Okay, enough.
Because you're a faggot?

Jared.
Jared.

Jesus!

Are you serious?

Get out!
Now!

Get the fuck out of here!
Let me see your face.

Oh, my God, are you bleeding?
Let's go upstairs, come on.

Come on, you'll be okay.

Are you fucking kidding me?

[dog barking, door slams]

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Okay.

Sit down.

It's a little cold.
Let me see it.

Oh, God.
Oh.

It's still pretty red.

Does it still hurt?

Yeah.

Okay, I'm gonna go
get you something for the pain.

Mom.

Tell me right now.

What?

What happened?

What are you talking about?

I don't want to hear
you don't remember.

But I don't.

Tell me right now, or you're
never playing "Fortnite" again.

[sighs]
Mom!

You better tell me
what happened, Jared,

and it better be the truth.

Mom, I'm scared.

<i>[melancholy music]</i>

We used to do patrol
in the morning in Kabul.

And the rule is, like,
whoever's driving

got to pick the music.

And, uh,
I had this buddy Booth.

He was from Little Rock,
Black dude.

He would play, like...

like, Masta Ace and Goodie Mob.

Some Wu-Tang.
That was good.

Wu-Tang is good driving
around...

and shooting.

[subway train rattling]

Hey, you know, I'm just
trying to be a nice guy.

You don't have to be all, like,
"ugh," about it, you know?

You know, I can tell
you have no clue who I am,

but you don't have
to ignore people.

You know, even if
I'm just somebody or nobody,

like, today's Mr. So-and-So

could be
a big deal tomorrow.

The tables turn pretty fast
in this world,

you know what I mean?

I'm just trying to be nice,
you know?

Sorry?

What the hell have you
ever been sorry for?

I beg... I beg your pardon?

What the hell are you
so worried about?

You're wearing
a $10,000 Cartier watch.

I don't have anything
in common with you anyway.

What the fuck
is taking so long, man?

<i>[indistinct announcement
on PA]</i>

God damn!

I got to be somewhere!

This is taking forever!

Does anything fucking work
right anymore?

I got somewhere to be!
I got a meeting!



I'm just fucking with you.
I don't have anywhere to be.

I don't have a meeting.
I don't even have a job.

Hey, what about you there,
Miss Lonely Heart?

You got a job?

[subway train rattling]

You remind me
a lot of my mother.

It's okay.
I get it.

You're a sick puppy,
aren't you?

I'm a sick puppy, too.

That's why
I'm gonna spare you...

even though you are
pretty fucking ungrateful.

Hey, guess what.

I'm so fucking full of love,
I feel like...

He's got a gun!
Whoa!
