<i>NO RITUALS, NO MAGIC.</i>

<i>IT ALREADY DWELLS</i>
<i>IN ALL OF US-- THAT'S IT,</i>

<i>THAT'S THE BATTLE.</i>

<i>THIS IS WAR.</i>

<i>THERE'S NO NEUTRAL GROUND.</i>

( playing harmonica tune )

Man:
<i>NEVER NEVER COME UP...</i>

COME ON.

( chattering )

AH!
ASSHOLE.

NO.  OW!
EASY, BUDDY.

WOULD YOU RELAX?
COME ON.

I DON'T LIKE
BEING OUT HERE.
IT CREEPS ME OUT.

NO ONE ASKED YOU
TO COME.

WE'RE TRESPASSING.
DO YOU HEAR THIS SHIT, BABY?

WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID OF ANYWAYS?

JANET HOBBS
CAME OUT HERE
FIVE YEARS AGO,

WENT MISSING,
NEVER CAME BACK.

YEAH WELL, JANET HOBBS
WAS A NUTJOB.

SHE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.
I DON'T SEE WHAT THE BIG
DEAL IS ANYWAYS.

IT'S JUST AN OLD HOUSE.
I THINK YOU'RE JUST SCARED.

AND I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINISHING
ALL BY YOURSELF TONIGHT.

YOU SERIOUS?

THE GRANVILLE PLACE
IS HAUNTED.

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?
MARTHA MAY?

CRAZY CHICK FROM THE '80s,
POSSESSED BY A DEMON.

( screaming )

( demonic voice )
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

 <i>( wind blowing )</i>
<i>- IT DID ALL KINDS</i>
<i>OF FREAKY SHIT TO HER.</i>

<i>( thunder crashes )</i>
<i>- ( screaming )</i>

YOU ARE
SO FULL OF SHIT.

MY MOM
WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
WITH THAT LADY.

SHE HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH THIS GUY
FROM ACROSS TOWN.

( exhales )

SHE COULDN'T
HANDLE THE GUILT.

( creaks )

IT DROVE HER CRAZY.

( shaky breath )

I HEARD SHE COMMITTED
SUICIDE OUT THERE.

THAT'S A LIE.
OKAY, THEN WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED, WISE-ASS?

THE REAL QUESTION IS

WHAT'S THE TOWN
HIDING FROM US?

<i>( coyote howls )</i>
<i>-</i> <i>( wind gusting )</i>

I WANNA SEE IT.

Woman:
NO!  FORGET ABOUT IT!

ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

I WANNA SEE
WHAT'S OUT THERE.

( moans )
SUSIE, NO.

WE'VE GROWN UP WITH THESE
STORIES OUR WHOLE LIFE.

AREN'T YOU CURIOUS
WHAT'S OUT THERE?

THAT'S JUST IT,
IT'S JUST STORIES.

THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE.
IT'S LIKE--

IT'S LIKE
A BAD PLACE, MAN.

<i>IT'S LIKE...</i>

VERY BAD.

Woman #2: <i>SUSIE!</i>
<i>- SHE'LL BE DEAD BY MORNING.</i>

( chuckles )

<i>- ( footsteps )</i>
<i>- ( owl hooting )</i>

( kisses )

( creaking )

HELLO?

Susie:
THIS PLACE IS
FREAKIN' CREEPY.

WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS SHIT?

( scoffs )
ARE YOU JOKING?
I MEAN THIS IS

FREAKIN' WEIRD.

WHO THE HELL WOULD
EVEN LIVE HERE?
HEY HEY.

I MEAN--
HEY HEY HEY!

WE'RE FINALLY
ALONE NOW.

YOU PROMISED.

<i>( bangs )</i>

THAT'S TOO ROUGH FOR ME.

IT'S TOO ROUGH
FOR ME.

SOMETHING DOESN'T
FEEL RIGHT.

NATHAN?

<i>NATHAN!</i>

<i>NATHAN?!</i>
<i>- ( moans )</i>

( gasps )

NATHAN?

NATHAN.

<i>( birds chirp )</i>

<i>( engine stops )</i>

SHERIFF HENDRICKS, RIGHT?
YEAH, WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE.

I'M MICHAEL BRODIE,
THIS IS MY WIFE RACHEL.

NICE TO MEET YOU.
HI.  YOU TOO.

HAVE ANY TROUBLE FINDING US?
YOUR TOWN DOESN'T REALLY
APPEAR ON MOST MAPS.

IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO SEE
WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT
OF YOUR FACE.

( laughs )
I'M--

I'M JUST MESSIN' WITH YOU.
NOT EVEN ON MOST MAPS.

LISTEN, I-- UH, I--
I REALLY APPRECIATE

WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

OH YEAH, GLAD TO HELP,
GLAD TO HELP.

IT'S NOT EVERY DAY WE GET
A BIG-CITY DETECTIVE HERE.

THE TRUTH IS MY DEPUTY
BAILED TOWN LAST MINUTE,

SO I WAS BOUND TO HIRE
THE FIRST PERSON
THAT CALLED.

( laughs )
MOST FOLKS WHO COME HERE

ARE USUALLY RUNNING
FROM SOMETHING.

THAT OR THEY GOT
NO PLACE ELSE TO GO.

I'M NOT RUNNING FROM ANYTHING.
WE'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING NEW.

AIN'T WE ALL?
AIN'T WE ALL?

ANYWAY, WINTER MONTHS ARE
USUALLY PRETTY QUIET HERE.

POPULATION JUST
UNDER A THOUSAND.

<i>WE'RE JUST SIMPLE FOLK</i>
<i>REALLY, JUST--</i>

IT'S THE WAY
I LIKE TO KEEP IT.

ALL RIGHT.

IT'S REALLY AMAZING.

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

UGH.  ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS THE PLACE.

THERE YOU GO.

THANK YOU.

YOU'RE WELCOME.
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

YEAH, THIS IS ONE
OF OUR SUMMER RENTALS.

UH, THE FAMILY DOESN'T
COME UP TILL JUNE

SO YOU GUYS ARE WELCOME
TO USE IT UNTIL YOU
FIND A PLACE.

OKAY, THANK YOU.

UNIFORM, GUN, BADGE.

ALL RIGHT, I GUESS
I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS ALONE.

LET YOU GET SETTLED IN.
THANK YOU.

THANKS.
YOU'RE WELCOME, WELCOME.

UM, I'LL PICK YOU UP
IN THE MORNING?

YEAH.
WELCOME TO GLENWOOD BAY.

( breathes deeply )
WELL, HERE WE GO.

HERE WE GO.

( waves lapping )

I MADE US BREAKFAST.
YEAH.

<i>( phone ringing )</i>

THIS IS MIKE.

<i>UH-HUH.</i>

WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY DO?

REALLY?
( snorts )

NO, OKAY,
I'LL BE THERE.

I'LL LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

( sighs )

WHAT WAS
THAT ABOUT?

IT WAS HENDRICKS.

FIRST DAY ON THE JOB,
ALREADY A MISSING PERSON.

I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
HAVE BREAKFAST TOGETHER.

I'M SORRY, RACH, YOU KNOW
THERE'S A MISSING PERSON.

I'M ALREADY LATE.

MMMM.

HAVE A GOOD DAY.

( rushing water )

( heavy breathing )

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

<i>( footsteps )</i>

( heavy breathing )

( sniffles )

<i>( child laughing )</i>

Rachel: <i>HELLO?</i>

<i>HELLO.</i>

ARE YOU OKAY?

MY HUSBAND AND I

LIVE IN THE HOUSE
OVER THERE.

I SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

MY SISTER LEFT ME HERE.

I HAVE TO GO.

WAIT UP.

HOLD UP.
LET ME JUST--

...HELP YOU.
 <i>( wind gusts )</i>

<i>( glass breaks )</i>

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

Mike:
SO WHO'S
THE MISSING PERSON?

Sheriff:
SOME LOCAL TEEN GIRL.

IT'S WEIRD.
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY WE GET
TO DO REAL POLICE WORK.

YEAH, WHAT'S THAT?
THAT?

THE LILY AMONG THORNS.

IT'S A SHIELD TO THOSE
WHO WALK IN INTEGRITY,

GUARDING THE PATHS
OF JUSTICE AND...

...AND WATCHING OVER
THE WAY OF HIS SAINTS.

IT'S PROVERBS 2,
VERSE SEVEN AND EIGHT.

YOU A RELIGIOUS MAN?

GOD-FEARING.
YOU?

( scoffs ) NO.

NOT ANYMORE.

<i>I REALLY DON'T</i>
<i>SEE THE POINT.</i>

EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
IN MY OPINION.

THAT'S A LONELY WAY
OF THINKING, SON.

YOUR CHOICE.

I CARE ABOUT THIS TOWN.

THE GOOD LORD HAS
BURDENED MY HEART

AND I SEE IT AS MY DUTY
TO PROTECT 'EM.

Woman:
<i>SUSIE WENT OUT</i>
<i>NIGHT BEFORE LAST</i>

AND SHE HASN'T COME HOME.

Sheriff:
<i>WAS SHE ALONE?</i>

THERE WAS A PARTY
OR SOMETHING.  I...

I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY WENT.

( whispers )
I TOLD HER WE COULDN'T
AFFORD IT.

HEY.

IT'S OKAY, MARGO.

GO AHEAD.

SHE WANTS TO GO
TO THE UNIVERSITY.

I TOLD HER
WE COULDN'T AFFORD IT,
SHE STORMED OUT

AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I SAW HER.

I'VE BEEN WORKING
AT WAYNE FLEENER'S,
THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT,

AND I'VE BEEN
SAVING EVERY PENNY
THAT I CAN AND I--

IT'S JUST--

DO YOU MIND
IF I KEEP THIS?

CAN YOU TELL ME
IF SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND,

A BEST FRIEND?
UH, YEAH.

THERE'S THIS KID
NATHAN MILLER.

SHE KNOWS I DON'T APPROVE.
AND WHY IS THAT?

'CAUSE HE'S GOT
ONE THING ON HIS MIND

AND SUSIE'S NOT VERY GOOD
AT TELLING HIM NO.

SHE'S DEAD, ISN'T SHE?

NO.  NO NO NO NO.

LET'S DON'T JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS, OKAY?

I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

I USED TO SPEAK
WITH SOMEONE
IN SAN FRANCISCO,

BUT I'M FINE.

MY HUSBAND, HE INSISTED
I COME SEE YOU.

OUR DAUGHTER WAS
KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

WHAT HAPPEN TO HER?

( loud splash )

( rushing water )

( gasps )

<i>YOUR DAUGHTER HAS BEEN</i>
<i>A HUGE PART OF YOUR LIFE.</i>

IF YOU WEREN'T THROWN
OFF-GUARD BY THIS,

THEN SOMETHING
WOULD BE WRONG.

MY HUSBAND BLAMES ME
FOR HER DEATH.

HAVE YOU FORGIVEN YOURSELF?

THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN
THE SAME SINCE.

HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

HE WON'T TOUCH ME.  HE--

HE'S MARRIED
TO HIS JOB.

HE DOESN'T CARE.

I THOUGHT MOVING HERE
WOULD CHANGE THINGS.

AND WHY DID YOU
MOVE HERE?

WE NEEDED A CHANGE

AND MICHAEL LET ME DECIDE.

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

I WENT TO SEE
DR. FARNELL TODAY.

ARE YOU TAKING
YOUR MEDS?

THEY MAKE ME NUMB.

( mouths )

( faint scream )

( gasping )

<i>( wind gusts )</i>

( creaking )

<i>( school bell rings )</i>

WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE HER?

ARE YOU THE NEW GUY?
YOU'RE KINDA CUTE.

MISS WILCOX.

MILLER-COMMA-NATHAN,
HER BOYFRIEND.

THEY LEFT THE PARTY EARLY.
YEAH, WHERE WAS THE PARTY?

CAMPFIRE IN THE FOREST,
NEAR THE OLD GRA--

IT WAS NOTHING,
MR. POLICE-OFFICER-MAN.
NOTHING.

WAS THERE DRUGS, HUH?  BOOZE?
HAVING A GOOD TIME?

WE DON'T KISS AND TELL.
THEY'RE-- THEY'RE FINE, MAN.

WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

SHERIFF HENDRICKS, I MEAN,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE US.

WHERE WERE THEY GOING?

WHAT'S A MAN LIKE YOU DOING
IN THIS HICK TOWN ANYWAY?

MISS WILCOX!
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO?

WHY DON'T YOU
ANSWER THE QUESTION?
HELL IF I KNOW.

SUSIE DIDN'T TELL ME.
YOU DON'T KNOW, HUH?

I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK YOU'RE LYING.

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

<i>( gusting wind )</i>

HELLO?

YOU AND SUSIE DUDLEY,
AS I UNDERSTAND, WERE
VERY GOOD FRIENDS?

<i>A LOT OF HISTORY THERE?</i>

DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN TO SUSIE?

YOU TELL ME.

ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THAT I'M KEEPING--

<i>WHAT I'M SUGGESTING</i>
<i>IS MAYBE</i>

HER DISAPPEARANCE
IS DISTURBING TO YOU.
( scoffs )

BUT THIS IS
TOTALLY LIKE SUSIE.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
<i>SHE'S ALWAYS RUNNING AWAY.</i>

SHE AND HER MOM WERE
ALWAYS AT IT.  I DIDN'T
THINK IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

JUST WANTS
THE ATTENTION.

WHERE'S HER BOYFRIEND
NATHAN?

I'LL GO PULL HIM FROM CLASS.
Sheriff: YEAH.

SO TELL ME
ABOUT FRIDAY NIGHT?

SUSIE'S MOM SAID
THERE WAS A PARTY?

YEAH, WE WENT
TO THE BOWLING ALLEY.
 <i>YOU'RE LYING TO ME!</i>

OKAY, YOUR FRIENDS TOLD ME
THERE WAS A CAMPFIRE
BY THE WOODS.

<i>WHY ARE YOU LYING?!</i>
<i>- IT WAS NOTHING.</i>

THEN WHY LIE ABOUT IT?

Sheriff:
<i>MISS COOK.</i>

IF YOU WANT TO KEEP
ON TRACK WITH ATTENDING
THAT IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL,

I'D ADVISE YOU TO ANSWER THI--
 <i>IT WAS JUST THIS</i>
<i>SENIOR-YEAR THING</i>

<i>WITH A FEW OF US</i>
<i>HANGING OUT IN THE WOODS.</i>

Sheriff:
<i>IT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE?</i>

NO SIR.

CAN I GO BACK
TO CLASS NOW?

EH, YOU KNOW
THERE'S NO NEED

TO SCARE THE HELL OUT
OF THESE KIDS, MICHAEL.

JUST FOLLOWING
YOUR ADVICE, HUH?

AND OUR DUTY
TO PROTECT THIS TOWN.
MURDER?

MICHAEL, WE HAVEN'T HAD
THAT KIND OF TROUBLE HERE
IN A LONG TIME.

LOOK, PEOPLE TALK--
ESPECIALLY THESE KIDS.

LAST THING I WANT IS
A PANIC, YOU UNDERSTAND?
<i>( door opens )</i>

LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT WAS ALL ABOUT,

<i>BUT, UH, WE GOT</i>
<i>ANOTHER PROBLEM.</i>

NATHAN MILLER DIDN'T
SHOW UP FOR CLASS TODAY.

<i>( cawing )</i>

( slams )

<i>( wind gusts )</i>
<i>- ( laughter )</i>

( screams )

Man:
<i>SOME LOCAL FISHERMAN</i>
<i>FOUND HIM NAKED,</i>

CURLED UP ON A BANK
THIS MORNING.

THEY BROUGHT HIM HERE.
( muttering in Spanish )

Mike: WHERE ARE HIS FOLKS?
BOTH DECEASED.

THE BOY LIVES
WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER.
HEY HEY HEY.

HEY HEY, SHE DROWNED.
SH-SHE-- SHE DROWNED.

<i>SHE DROWNED,</i>
<i>SHE DROWNED, SHE DROWNED,</i>
<i>SHE DROWNED.</i>

IS SHE DEAD?
SHE DROWNED!
SHE DROWNED.

SHE DROWNED,
I HEAR SHE DID.
I DON'T KNOW.

SHE DROWNED, SHE DROWNED!
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

SHE DROWNED!

SHE DROWNED!

SHE DROWNED.

HEY, HE DOES THIS
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

<i>SHE DROWNED.</i>

A HOUSE DIVIDED UPON ITSELF

WILL FALL
INTO WRACK AND RUIN.

<i>IN THE GREAT ABYSS</i>
<i>THE SEVEN PRINCESSES DWELL!</i>

IT'S A TRICK, IT'S A TRICK!
TH-- THEY'RE FAKIN' YA.

THEY-THEY WANT TO REACH OUT
FROM HELL.

BRING YOU BACK.
BRING YOU BACK TO HELL!

DRAG YOU
INTO HELL-LLL...

Doctor: ALL RIGHT!
<i>HELL...</i>

LOVELY TOWN
YOU GOT HERE.

LIKE I SAID,
HE DOES THAT EVERY DAY.

HERE'S OUR BOY.

HASN'T SAID A WORD
SINCE HE'S BEEN HERE.

COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE.

Mike:
ANY BLOOD,

BRUISES OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT?

<i>NOT A TRACE.</i>

SOMETHING SCARED
THE HELL OUT OF HIM.

HEY, NATHAN.

HEY, NATHAN,
IT'S SHERIFF HENDRICKS HERE.

WE'VE GOT A FEW QUESTIONS
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU.

YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
AT ALL ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT

IN THE WOODS
WITH SUSIE DUDLEY?

YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

NATHAN?

NATHAN!

POSSIBILITY HE MIGHT
BE FAKING, DOCTOR?

THAT'S HIGHLY DOUBTFUL.

Mike:
<i>YEAH, BUT IS THERE</i>
<i>A POSSIBILITY?</i>

W-- ( sighs )
WELL--

OF COURSE THERE'S
A POSSIBILITY, BUT--

<i>"REVERTAR</i>

<i>IN DOMUM</i>
<i>MEAM UNDE EXIVI."</i>

WHAT THE HELL'S HE DOING?
I-I DON'T--

( screaming )

NO NO!  NO NO,
DON'T CUFF HIM,
DON'T CUFF HIM!

IT'S TOO EARLY!
SHAW, EITHER HELP OR GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

I'M JUST TRYING
TO DO MY JOB!

Sheriff:
GET HIM UP.

<i>( owl hoots,</i>
<i>insects chirping )</i>
<i>- Mike:</i> <i>I'VE GOT ALL DAY, SON.</i>

<i>WHERE IS SUSIE DUDLEY?</i>

WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL ME NOW?

<i>NATHAN!</i>

<i>HEY!</i>

<i>SUSIE DUDLEY--</i>

WHERE IS SHE?

I WANNA KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

<i>"REVERTAR IN DOMUM</i>

<i>MEAM UNDE EXIVI."</i>

ALL RIGHT,
YOU LISTEN TO ME,
YOU LITTLE SHIT!

HUH?
DID YOU SEE SOMETHING?

YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

YOU TELL ME.
I NEED TO KNOW!

BRODIE!

EASE OFF.

YOU KNOW, SON, FINDING
SUSIE DUDLEY'S NOT GONNA
BRING YOUR DAUGHTER BACK.

WHAT THE HELL'S
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

IT JUST MEANS
THERE'S SOME THINGS
IN THIS DAMNED LIFE

YOU'RE NOT
IN CONTROL OF.

YOU WANT ME
TO WRITE THAT DOWN?

I THINK YOU'RE FORGETTING
WHOSE OPERATION THIS IS.

( snickers )
YOUR GAME'S A JOKE.

WHAT IS IT YOU'RE AFTER, SON?
I WANT THE TRUTH.

YOU CHASE THE TRUTH

LIKE A RADICAL CRUSADER.

I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
DO YOU?

YEAH.

WHY DON'T YOU
EXPLAIN TO ME

WHY SOME PUNK KID'S
SPEAKING IN A DEAD
LANGUAGE.

<i>SUSIE DUDLEY'S</i>
<i>STILL MISSING.</i>

I HEARD HER BOYFRIEND NATHAN
DONE IT.

I HEARD HE WENT CRAZY.
MY DAUGHTER'S FRIEND
TOLD HER ABOUT IT.

WELL, SHERIFF HENDRICKS
AIN'T SAYING A WORD,

BUT I HEARD
SOMEONE SAW SUSIE

SNEAKING AROUND
THE OLD GRANVILLE PLACE.

<i>I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,</i>

SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT
ABOUT THAT HOUSE.

DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND.

THERE'S SOMETHING
EVIL OUT THERE.

IT'S CURSED
AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE.

Nathan:
<i>Revertar in domum</i>
<i>meam unde exivi.</i>

( clicks )

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

"I WILL RETURN TO MY HOUSE
FROM WHICH I CAME."

HE'S TALKING ABOUT
UNCLEAN SPIRITS.

UNCLEAN SPIRITS?

YOU REALLY BELIEVE
IN THIS HOCUS-POCUS?

THE HOUSE HE'S REFERRING TO
IS THE BODY.

THE DEMON RETURNING
TO THE PLACE WHERE
IT ONCE DWELLED,

BUT ONLY IF
IT'S AN EMPTY VESSEL.
AN EMPTY VESSEL?

SOULS.

LUKE 11, VERSE 26,

THE DEMON GOES
AND GETS SEVEN OTHER SPIRITS
MORE EVIL THAN ITSELF,

AND THEY ENTER AND DWELL
WITHIN THE VACANT SOUL.

THE PERSON ENDS UP FAR WORSE
THAN THEY WERE BEFORE.

YOU EVER SEE
ANYTHING LIKE THIS?

( breathes heavily ) NO.

S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

MAKE OF THAT?

I BELIEVE THAT
THERE ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS
OF EVIL IN THE WORLD.

NO RITUALS, NO MAGIC.

IT ALREADY DWELLS
IN ALL OF US.

THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE BATTLE.

THIS IS WAR.

THERE'S NO NEUTRAL GROUND.

"BETHY BANKS."

PROBABLY MAKE IT EASIER
IF YOU TALKED ABOUT IT.

NOTHING.

RACHEL JUST LIKES
TO RATTLE MY CAGE.

MMM.  FROM WHAT
I SAW LAST NIGHT,

IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING
WAS RATTLING HERS.

SHE BLAMES HERSELF

FOR OUR DAUGHTER'S DEATH.

WHO DO YOU BLAME?

YOU SEE GOOD PEOPLE
GET SHIT ON ALL THE TIME

AND HE LETS IT HAPPEN.

SO I SAY TO HELL WITH HIM.

WHAT GOOD PEOPLE,
MICHAEL?

THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
GOOD AND EVIL.

THAT'S THE GAME.

THE CURSE.

BUT REALLY WHO IS
INNOCENT WHEN STANDING HERE
BEFORE THE ALMIGHTY?

WE ALL FACE THE ENEMY
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

JUST EXILES
WANDERING AROUND.

YOU'RE ANGRY.
UNDERSTANDABLE.

DON'T MAKE IT WORSE

OTHERWISE YOU GIVE

RACHEL, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
YOU...

LET YOUR HOUSEHOLD FALL.

OKAY, RACHEL,
STOP THIS, HUH?

WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?
WE WERE NEVER ENOUGH.

EMILY NEEDED A FATHER.

RACHEL, THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU KILLED HER!

HEY!
YOU KILLED YOUR BABY GIRL.

( laughing )
DO NOT SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT!

YOU'RE A FAKE.

WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU, HUH?

GIVE YOURSELF UP FOR HER!
CLEANSE HER!

SANCTIFY HER

BY WASHING HER
OF WATER WITH THE WORD.

NEVER HAS ONE HATED
THEIR OWN FLESH.

HOLD FAST.

ONE FLESH.
STOP THIS, HUH?!

LIES AND TRICKS.

YOU DECEITFUL BASTARD.

( gags )

( screaming )

STOP IT!
STOP IT.

GET OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT OF HERE!

YOU'RE NOT WELCOME!
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME!

<i>YOU'RE NOT WEL--</i>
<i>( shouts )</i>

( growling )
STOP IT.

STOP IT!

( screaming )

STOP IT.

( roars )

( panting )

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

Mike:
<i>I SHOULD'VE STOOD</i>
<i>BY HER SIDE.</i>

<i>I SHOULD'VE</i>
<i>LISTENED TO HER.</i>

<i>I CAN'T EXPLAIN</i>
<i>WHAT I SAW.</i>

( sniffles )

I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
I BELIEVE IT MYSELF, BUT...

I KNOW I CAN'T
CONTROL IT.

THE MIND'S A PRISON
OF YOUR OWN MAKING.

FUNNY THING ABOUT
THAT LITTLE FELLA--

SO SMALL TO BE CARRYING
ALL THAT WEIGHT BY HIMSELF.

YEAH, BUT HE'S STILL
CARRYING IT.

YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE, MICHAEL?

SHOW HER.

IT JUST AIN'T RIGHT.

THE MAN'S BEEN THROUGH HELL
AND BACK WITH HIS WIFE.

HIS WIFE?
I'D LISTEN TO HIM.

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

IT PROBABLY AIN'T
MY PLACE TO SAY.

<i>THIS TOWN IS</i>
<i>FULL OF SECRETS.</i>

<i>WE'RE ALL JUST</i>
<i>CREATURES OF HABIT.</i>

<i>WE DON'T LOOK TO RIGHT</i>
<i>OUR WRONGS.  WE JUST--</i>

<i>WE JUST LIVE WITH THEM.</i>

HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY STRANGE
PATTERNS WITH YOUR WIFE?

FITS?  BLACKOUTS?

SELF-MUTILATIONS?

<i>( door opens, shuts )</i>

YOUR WIFE WROTE
THAT PHRASE...

<i>20 YEARS AGO.</i>

<i>SHE WAS</i>
<i>A PATIENT HERE.</i>

I-I WAS JUST AN INTERN,

BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

WE BROUGHT HER IN
AND WE OBSERVED HER
VERY CLOSELY--

<i>BLANCH RACHEL BANKS.</i>

<i>( little girl laughing )</i>

Mike:
<i>THIS IS BULLSHIT.</i>
<i>YOU'RE BOTH--</i>

<i>YOU'RE BOTH FULL OF SHIT.</i>

THE BOTH OF YOU,
YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT!

WE GET SO TANGLED

IN OUR REGRETS
OF THE PAST.

WE THINK WE CAN
JUST BURY IT FOREVER,

CREATE A NEW IDENTITY,
START OVER.

BUT THE TRUTH...

<i>WILL SURFACE.</i>

I DARE YOU
TO GO INSIDE, BETHY.
MOM SAID NOT TO GO INSIDE.

YOU'RE SUCH A MAMA'S GIRL.
NO, I'M NOT.

I HATE YOU!

BLANCH, BLANCH, NO!

( slams )

Where is
your sister-- Beth?

Am I my sister's keeper?
( static buzzes )

Why are you angry?

<i>If you do</i>
<i>what is right,</i>

<i>will you not</i>
<i>be accepted?</i>

Where is your sister?
 <i>( voice whispers )</i>

Her blood cries out
to me from the ground.

( screaming )

No, leave me alone,
please!

( shrieking )

( screaming )

Mike:
NO NO NO NO NO.

RACHEL, RACHEL.

<i>THIS CAN'T BE--</i>

<i>THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.</i>

IT'S AN ANAGRAM.

"ASMODEUS."

Shaw:
<i>FROM THE BOOK OF ENOCH.</i>

IT'S A HEBREW WORD
WHICH MEANS "TO DESTROY."

ASMODEUS IS REFERRED
TO AS ONE OF THE SEVEN

PRINCES OF HELL.

<i>A FALLEN ANGEL</i>

<i>CAST DOWN TO THE EARTH</i>
<i>FROM THE WAR IN HEAVEN.</i>

A-- A DEMON OF LUST,

HATE AND JEALOUSY,

RESPONSIBLE FOR TWISTING
MEN'S DESIRES.

THE COPS NEVER FOUND
HER BODY.

WHAT BODY?

WHEN THE POLICE
DISCOVERED YOUR WIFE

SHE WAS INSIDE
AN ABANDONED HOME,

SHAKING UNCONTROLLABLY.

<i>WE BROUGHT HER IN</i>
<i>AND WE OBSERVED HER</i>

<i>VERY CAREFULLY.</i>

SHE DIDN'T SPEAK

FOR WEEKS.

<i>AND WHEN SHE</i>
<i>FINALLY DID TALK,</i>

<i>SHE SAID THAT</i>
<i>HER SISTER BETHY</i>

HAD BEEN RAPED
AND KILLED.

SHE WAS LYING.

( slams )

BLANCH, THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

BLANCH!

( shrieking )

SHHH.

( sobs )

( screams )

<i>( alarm ringing )</i>

<i>( insects chirping,</i>
<i>owl hoots )</i>

ARE-- ARE YOU
TELLING ME THAT MY WIFE

IS POSSESSED BY A--
THE MIND IS A POWERFUL THING.

SHE DID
EVERYTHING SHE COULD

TO BLOCK IT OUT.

( exhales )

HENDRICKS!

SON OF A BITCH.

<i>( keys rattling )</i>

MY GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED?

<i>WE'RE ALL JUST CREATURES</i>
<i>OF HABIT.</i>

<i>I-- I WANTED HER.</i>

WE GRASP ONTO IT.

CAPABLE OF

ANYTHING.

I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF.

( screaming )
DON'T TOUCH ME!

NATHAN, NATHAN!
( fabric rips )

PLEASE!
GET OFF ME!

( gasping )
DON'T!

I CAN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF
FOR WHAT I DID.

I KILLED HER.

<i>( insects chirping )</i>

<i>( wind gusting )</i>

HENDRICKS?

HENDRICKS?

<i>( music box playing )</i>

<i>( music stops )</i>

<i>( melody playing )</i>

<i>"MARTHA MAY HENDRICKS</i>

BEGAN TO BE DISTURBED

<i>BY SCRATCHING SOUNDS</i>
<i>THAT CAME FROM THE BASEMENT..."</i>

<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

"...AND OBJECTS WERE
OFTEN FOUND TO BE MOVED

<i>WITHOUT EXPLANATION.</i>

SHE REPORTED TO HER HUSBAND

THAT SHE'D FELT
REJECTED AND ALONE..."

( moaning )
<i>"...AND HAD BEEN INVADED</i>
<i>BY AN INVISIBLE ENTITY."</i>

( creaks )

<i>( Martha May whimpering )</i>

( record scratching )

( gasps, shuddering )

<i>( wind gusting )</i>

<i>( low growl )</i>

"WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS
OUT OF TOWN,

MARTHA MAY CLAIMED

SHE WAS BEING ATTACKED
BY AN UNSEEN FORCE."

( gasps )

( screaming )

<i>"...FOLLOWED OUT</i>
<i>TO THE GRANVILLE ESTATE,</i>

<i>WHERE AN EXORCISM</i>
<i>WAS ATTEMPTED."</i>
<i>- ( screaming )</i>

S-U-E-D-O...

"SHE KILLED HERSELF
WITH A BLADE

AFTER A FAILED ATTEMPT
OF EXORCISM

BY FATHER CALLAHAN
OF CORNERSTONE."

NO!

FATHER CALLAHAN.

"MARTHA MAY HENDRICKS
IS SURVIVED

BY HER HUSBAND
DEPUTY JED HENDRICKS."

( exhales )

<i>( bag dragging )</i>

( humming )

( humming stops )

HOW COULD YOU
COVER THIS UP?

HOW COULD YOU LIE
ABOUT THIS?

YOU THINK
YOU KNOW A LOT, BUT...

YOU DON'T KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY.

I KNOW YOU'RE HIDING
BEHIND THIS.

I WASN'T
ACTING UNDER GOD'S
AUTHORITY AND POWER

WHEN I DID
THE DELIVERANCE.

WAS I WRONG?

ABSOLUTELY.

WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU WANT FROM ME?

MY WIFE

NEEDS YOUR HELP.

( chuckles )

I CAN'T.

LOOK, THIS-THIS--
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE

FOR REDEMPTION
RIGHT HERE.

NO ONE ELSE HAS SEEN
THIS BEFORE.

I NEED YOUR HELP.
I'M BEGGIN' YOU.

I SWORE I WOULDN'T
DO IT AGAIN.

PLEASE.

I CAN'T.

I'M SORRY,
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

YOU'RE A COWARD!
THAT'S ALL YOU ARE!
YOU'RE A FAKE!

OH MY GOD.

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

( demonic voice )
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

<i>( wind blowing )</i>

( screams )
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

( gasps, moaning )

YOUR WIFE IS
A WHORE IN HELL.

( grunting )

YOU TOOK EVERYTHING
FROM ME.

Mike:
<i>RACHEL!</i>

PUT THE KNIFE DOWN, OKAY?

RACHEL.
RACHEL?

OH, SHE'S NOT HERE
RIGHT NOW.

( gate slams )

WE CAN WORK
THIS OUT, OKAY?

( grunts )

( growling )
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

S-U-E-D-O--

S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

( shrieks )

( yelps )

( breathing heavily )

I'VE WANDERED
THROUGH THE DESERT

AND FOUND NO REST.

"SWEPT AND GARNISHED,

BUT STILL EMPTY."

RACHEL!

RACHEL!

<i>( rattles, wind gusting )</i>

Demonic Rachel:
<i>"GO PROCLAIM THE WORD.</i>

<i>WHOEVER BELIEVES</i>
<i>WILL BE SAVED."</i>

<i>IF YOU DON'T, YOU DIE.</i>
<i>YOUR BLOOD SPILLS.</i>

<i>( laughter )</i>

<i>"OH, IN MY NAME</i>

<i>THEY WILL CAST OUT DEMONS,</i>

<i>SPEAK IN TONGUES,</i>
<i>PICK UP SNAKES."</i>

<i>AT THE RIGHT HAND</i>
<i>OF GOD I SIT.</i>

ALL AUTHORITY ON EARTH
HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ME.

RACHEL!
<i>( wailing )</i>

RACHEL.

IT'S ME.

IT'S MICHAEL.
( soft sobbing )

HEY, SWEETIE,

LISTEN,

IT'S GONNA
BE OKAY, OKAY?

( screams )
HEY!

RACHEL!
( speaking Latin )

RACHEL, LISTEN TO ME!
( screams )

RACHEL, IT'S ME!
( screaming continues )

IT'S ME!

RACHEL!
"I SAW SATAN FALL

<i>LIKE LIGHTNING</i>
<i>FROM HEAVEN.</i>

BEHOLD,

I HAVE GIVEN YOU AUTHORITY
TO TREAD ON SERPENTS."

RACHEL!

( shouts )

( seductively )
LIE WITH ME, PRIEST.

TAKE MY BODY.

TASTE IT.

( breathing heavily )
I KNOW YOU WANT TO.

FATHER,

GIVE ME STRENGTH.

( cackles )

YOU'RE WEAK.

( growls )

TASTE MY BODY, PRIEST.

TOUCH IT.
( moans )

"YOU WILL NOT SURELY DIE."

HELP ME, FATHER.
I LAY MY FEARS AT YOUR FEET.

I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.
YOU RAN AWAY!

A SCARED-SHITLESS PRIEST.

<i>YOU ARE A COWARD!</i>

A FAKE!

( roars )

( laughs, pants )
GIVE ME YOUR NAME!

YOU WANNA TOUCH ME.

YOU WANNA TASTE ME.
GIVE ME YOUR NAME.

GIVE ME YOUR SEED, PRIEST!

HA!
GIVE ME YOUR NAME!

( screaming Latin )

( growls )

FEAR ME.

<i>DOUBTS AND LIES, PRIEST.</i>

DOUBTS AND LIES!

YOU FAKE!
COME ON, PRIEST.

OH, YOU CAN DO
BETTER THAN THAT.
I KNOW YOU CAN.

COME ON, HIT ME.
HIT ME REALLY HARD.

<i>( bones cracking )</i>
<i>- "ANOINTED GUARDIAN CHERUB,</i>

IN THE MIDST OF STONES
AND FIRE YOU WALK."

( screaming, groaning )

"I CAST YOU AS A PROFANE EVIL
FROM THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD.

AND I DESTROY YOU!"
<i>( bones crack )</i>

( screaming continuously )

"YOU HAVE COME
TO A DREADFUL END AND SHALL
BE NO MORE FOREVER!"

ALL OF THIS I GIVE TO YOU,

IF YOU BOW DOWN

AND WORSHIP ME.

YOU'RE A FAKE.
WHO IS YOUR MASTER?

SEVEN DWELL INSIDE ME.

YOU'RE A COWARD!
SAY HIS NAME!

HIM I KNOW.

YOU I DON'T.

( screaming,
bones cracking )

"I SAW HIS SPIRIT COME DOWN
FROM THE SKY LIKE A DOVE."
SAY HIS NAME!

( hisses )

( growling )

YOU'RE A COWARD.
SAY HIS NAME!

<i>SAY HIS NAME!</i>

HIS NAME!
"YOU HAVE COME
TO A DREADFUL END!"

SAY HIS NAME.
SAY HIS NAME!

YESHUA!

( deep voice )
YESHUA!

YE-SHU-AAA!

( panting )

<i>( birds chirping )</i>

THIS CHANGES THINGS,

DOESN'T IT?

HEY,

I THINK YOU'RE
GETTING BETTER.

YOU KNOW I'M NOT.

NO.

WHY ARE YOU HERE?

'CAUSE WE'RE
ON THE SAME SIDE, RACHEL.

I LOVE YOU

AND I WILL SPEND

THE REST OF MY LIFE
SHOWING YOU THAT.

YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

I'M SORRY.

YOU WERE THERE

<i>AND YOU KEPT IT</i>
<i>A SECRET.</i>

YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS A KID

MY DADDY TOOK ME
TO THE RIALTO

TO SEE "THE MAN WHO SHOT
LIBERTY VALANCE."

MMM!
JOHN WAYNE,
JIMMY STEWART,

<i>LEE MARVIN.</i>

WHEN 'OL LIBERTY COME
STROLLING THROUGH TOWN,

HE'D JUST TAKE WHATEVER
THE HELL HE WANTED.

THAT IS
UNTIL RANSOM STODDARD
HAD THE COURAGE

TO STAND UP
FOR THE TOWN.

HE GOT BEAT DOWN,
KICKED, SPIT ON,

BUT HE LOOKED FEAR
IN THE EYE WITH COURAGE

AND INTEGRITY.

THAT STUCK WITH ME.

DIDN'T GIVE AN INCH.

WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR WIFE?

JESUS CHRIST,
YOU GOTTA HELP US.
I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU!

I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T DO IT!
I'M SORRY!

YOU CAN NEVER SATISFY ME

<i>THE WAY THAT HE DID.</i>

<i>I CARRY HIS SEED</i>
<i>INSIDE OF ME.</i>

( sinister laughter )

<i>YOU'RE WEAK.</i>

<i>( low growl )</i>

HENDRICKS, DON'T DO IT.

Martha May:
<i>YOU'RE A FAKE.</i>

<i>COME ON DO IT.</i>
<i>DO IT!</i>

HENDRICKS, NO, STOP!
( screams )

NO!

MARTHA MAY, SHE BROUGHT
THAT DEMON INTO OUR HOME

WHERE IT DWELLED
AND-AND-AND SEDUCED HER

AND TORTURED HER.

MICHAEL, TEMP-- TEMPTATION

TO GIVE INTO EVIL,
IT COMES FROM US

AND ONLY US.
SHE KNEW WHAT SHE DID.

THERE'S NO ONE TO BLAME

BUT THE S-- SEDUCING

AND-AND-AND LEERING
FLARE-UP OF OUR OWN LUST.

<i>THAT'S WHERE MY WIFE</i>
<i>FOUND FULFILLMENT,</i>

BUT IT WAS A LIE!

SHE ALLOWED EVIL

TO-TO-TO FLOURISH

AND THAT BECAME
THE REAL KILLER!

YOU KILLED AN INNOCENT PERSON.
SHE WAS NOT INNOCENT!

SHE WAS IN THE ARMS
OF ANOTHER MAN!

( moaning )

I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

THAT'S A LONELY
WAY OF THINKING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

FUNNY THING ABOUT
THAT LITTLE FELLA--

SO SMALL, STILL CARRYING
ALL THAT WEIGHT BY HIMSELF.

BUT HE'S STILL CARRYING IT.

<i>WE ALL HAVE OUR...</i>

<i>TROVE OF SECRETS,</i>

REGRETS.

THAT WAS THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE, MICHAEL.

THERE'S NOT A DAY GOES BY
I DON'T RUN IT OVER

AND OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AND OVER
AND OVER...

OH GOD, I WISH
I COULD STOP MY ANGER,

<i>THAT BLADE.</i>

PRIDE COMES...

( sighs )

DISGRACE FOLLOWS.

Sheriff: <i>I--</i>

I REALIZE I DON'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES ANYMORE.

I'M DONE.

I'M FINISHED.

<i>"WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM,</i>

<i>WHO WILL DELIVER ME</i>
<i>FROM THIS BODY OF DEATH?"</i>

<i>I'M FINISHED.</i>

MIMIC THE ONE WHO

TOOK A STAND,

DIDN'T GIVE AN INCH.

I'LL BE DAMNED.

<i>YOU A RELIGIOUS GUY?</i>

Mike:
<i>GOD-FEARING.</i>

Callahan:
<i>I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE</i>

<i>DIFFERENT LEVELS</i>
<i>OF EVIL IN THE WORLD.</i>

<i>NO RITUALS.</i>
<i>NO MAGIC.</i>

<i>IT ALREADY DWELLS</i>
<i>IN ALL OF US-- THAT'S IT,</i>

<i>THAT'S THE BATTLE.</i>

<i>( wind gusting )</i>

Callahan:
<i>THIS IS WAR.</i>

<i>THERE'S NO NEUTRAL GROUND.</i>

<i>( dramatic music playing )</i>

<i>( music fades )</i>
