They found another one.

There's going to be
no treasure left

by the time she gets here!

Mark the location!

That's the Frenchman!

And over there, Kristos.

They're all coming.

All except one.

All right, follow Kristos.

When he dives,

we dive.

Maybe we'll get lucky

and find whatever it is
that's down there.

Hey, look at that, Jimmy. Look.

Why isn't she slowing down?

-You were asking?
-I knew it.

-Whoa!
-Whoo!

Hello, boys.

You're all wet.

Half the world's raiders
are already here,

Half the world's raiders
are already here,

and you make us wait.

But you know
I can't resist a bit of fun.

Huh.

Lara, tell us,

what's all this fuss about?

What does everybody think

is down there?

Well, I don't know

what everybody thinks
is down there,

but... I think
it's the Luna Temple.

The Luna Temple?

My sons-- if it's
not on television,

forget it.

It's a temple built
by Alexander the Great.

Who was Greek,
in case you don't know.

Yeah, yeah.

Alexander collected treasures

from all over the world.

He stored them in two places.

The majority went to his library
in Egypt,

but his
most prized possessions

went here-- the Luna Temple.

By law, no one was allowed
to record its location.

And in 330 B.C. it was...

...swallowed by the sea.

Destroyed during
a volcanic eruption.

Lost forever.

Until yesterday.

Ah.

If even half the temple

is intact, it will still be

the greatest find
since the pyramids.

The others head
into this area here

along this shelf.

And that's based

-on the currents?
-Yes.

Ah. This, Gus,
was why I was late.

Oh.

It's a geological,
taken two hours after the quake.

The epicenter was here
five miles northeast of us.

But look at the currents
along the shelf now.

Wait. They've shifted.

So, while they're
all diving there,

the ruins will actually be...

Here.

Let's go.

Something wrong?

First, Alexander doesn't record
the temple's location.

Then God wipes it from the Earth
with a volcano.

Now even the currents change.

Lara, maybe this temple's
not meant to be found.

Everything lost
is meant to be found.

Don't worry.

It's unbelievable!

Whoo!

Oh, my God.

This is huge.

Wonderful.

Jimmy, this is wonderful.

Do you see what I see?

Oh, my God.

-Oh, my God.
-It's incredible.

Nicky, look at this.

We're going to be rich.

Hey, Lara,

what do you say
to two handsome Greek partners?

Well, when you find two,
let me know.

Hey, she's talking about you.

No, you.

Pack the gold coins.

Give me that.
Give me that.

Lara, what is that?

It's mine.

What is she doing?

Lara, that column
is collapsing!

Aftershock!

I think that's
a sign to leave!

Two minutes.

Lara, we need to leave now!

Lara, we need to leave now!

We've got to move!

Keep packing.

This thing is gonna collapse!

You take those two.

We have to hurry up!

We've got to go.
We've got to go now! Come on!

Okay.

Lara!

Lara!

Lara, it's us.

Hillary and Bryce!

She's disorientated.

That's normal after three days.

Nice day for a dip?

Gentlemen...

there is an expression:

"It's not nice
to fool Mother Nature."

Yet that is precisely
what I've been doing

for some time now.

Whether it be sarin gas
for Mr. San...

improved typhoid

for Mr. Krev to use
in the Balkans...

enhanced cholera
for Mr. Duvalier.

But...

while these weapons
serve their purpose,

there have always been
limitations.

Stable diseases aren't lethal.

Deadly ones burn out
too quickly.

Mother Nature can only be fooled
so much.

Deploy my weapon,

and your enemies--
however great--

will collapse from within.

Rather like Mr. Monza
is collapsing right now.

What the hell is going on?

Monza told Ml6
about this meeting.

That's why the change
of location.

He was going to turn
me over to them

and then seek
asylum in the West.

A smart man would have
known I was on to him.

He would never have
got on the plane.

But I knew you would, Mr. Monza,

because you actually
thought you could fool me.

That, gentlemen,

is the sound
of a traitor dying.

That was an accelerated form
of Ebola,

deadliest disease known to man.

Highly contagious.

However...

as with all known diseases,

there exist stockpiles
of antiserum in the West.

There is no antiserum

for what I am offering you.

No treatment.

No vaccine, no cure.

The modern world has never seen

anything like
what I've uncovered.

"Uncovered"?

Yes, I've branched out.

Archaeology.

Zero-seven-seven-four-four

six-eight-one.

That is the account
at the largest bank in Bern.

$1 00 million each,
if you please.

Where's Chen Lo?

He's got the orb,
but Ml6 is on to him.

How?

He doesn't know,
but rather than risk

bringing it here,
he's waiting.

I have just told
a cabin full of men

about Pandora.

The clock cannot be reset.

Tell Chen Lo to bring
the orb to me at once.

You'll find the killers!

Don't take it out on me!

Ya!

Ya!

Ya!

Bryce! What have we got?

Well, I haven't even finished
loading the images

from your camera yet.

What about references to an orb?

I took the liberty of checking.

Historical inventories
of the Luna Temple

do not list any orb.

Then I want you both to list

every orb ever mentioned
in Greek history.

Every one?

Ha!

Ah...

Ya!

That's...

Iiable...

to be...

...thousands.

Then we'll read thousands.

Start with that one.

Perhaps you gentlemen would
like some tea while you wait?

No, they wouldn't.

Tea is for guests.
The door is for intruders.

Lara, these men are from Ml6.

Yes, I can tell

from their soft hands
and pressed suits

that these are the men
who make decisions

and leave the dirty
work for others.

I have no interest in...

His name's Chen Lo.

Along with his brother Xien,

he runs a ring of Chinese
bandits known as the Shay-Ling.

They deal in guns,

diamonds, antiquities,
anything that Chen Lo

can sell on the black market.

They followed you from the
moment you arrived in Santorini,

where they killed your friend,
Gus, and sank his boat.

Why?

For this.

After you were
picked up at sea,

our listening post in Malta
intercepted that fax.

It was sent from Chen Lo
to a man named Jonathan Reiss.

What, the scientist?
Won the Nobel Prize.

He's now
the foremost designer

of biological weapons
in the world.

His creations have been
at the heart

of every act of bioterror
in the past 1 5 years.

Reiss's disdain
for life is legendary.

He has no political agenda.

He doesn't care
who his weapons kill, or why.

A modern-day Dr. Mengele.

We know Chen Lo followed you
in order to obtain the orb,

but we also know that
he'll deliver Reiss.

What we don't know is why.

Candidly, that terrifies us.

Reiss is not to be trifled with.

Pandora's box.

Reiss is going to use the orb
to find Pandora's box.

Do you mean the Greek myth?

Pandora's given a box by God,
told not to open it.

She does and unleashes
pain into the world?

That's the Sunday school
version, yes.

How do you think life began?

Shooting star,
primordial ooze?

In 2300 BC,
an Egyptian pharaoh

found a place that he named

the Cradle of Life,
where we, life, began.

And there, he found a box,

the box which brought
life to Earth.

The pharaoh opened the box,

but all that was left inside
was the Ramante, or anti-life.

The plague which came as
the companion

to life.

Companion?

Nature is about balance.

All the world comes in pairs.

Yin and Yang.
Right and wrong. Men and women.

What's pleasure without pain?

What did this plague do?

It leveled the pharaoh's army.

The pharaoh's son dispatched
his finest soldier

to take the box and transport it
to the end of the world.

2,000 years later, Alexander
the Great reached lndia,

where his army was ravaged

by a plague,
after one of his men

found a box among some remains.

India? That's where
the pharaoh's man brought it?

Mmm. Alexander felt
that the box was too powerful

to be trusted to any man,

so he returned it to its home
in the Cradle of Life.

And it has never
been seen since.

And this... Cradle of Life
is where?

No one knows.

Alexander found it using
a map that was with the box.

A map he then hid
from the world.

But the name he gave
this map was Mati.

And the literal translation
for the word "Mati" is "eye."

The orb is the map,

hidden in the Luna Temple
by Alexander.

And Reiss will use it
to find Pandora's box.

And when he does,
when he opens it,

he will unleash a weapon
more powerful

than you could ever imagine.

The markings definitely form
a pattern, but...

even if I figure out
what they represent,

we still can't read
the whole map,

because... we've only got
a partial view of it, you see?

Well, we have to figure out
how to read it.

Right. Thank you.

On behalf of Her Majesty,

we formally request
that you find

and recover this box
before Dr. Reiss.

Oh!

Well, now that I have
Her Majesty's permission...

Tell me where
to find the orb.

Last we heard, it was
somewhere in China

with Chen Lo
and the Shay-Ling.

Finding them will be
next to impossible,

but we'll assign two
of our best agents to help.

I don't want them.

With all due respect, expertise
in archaeology doesn't...

I didn't say that
I don't need help,

but your agents
will never get me

to Chen Lo in time.

I need an insider,
someone who knows

the Shay-Ling.

Their methods, their hideouts.

I need Terry Sheridan.

Not in a million years.

Not if he were the
last man on Earth.

Terry Sheridan--
formerly a commander

with the Royal Marines,
turned mercenary and traitor.

You don't honestly expect me

to put that man on the trail
of a weapon

he can turn around and sell
to the highest bidder?

Open.

I am your host...

Armin Kal.

Welcome to Fantasy lsland.

Croft.

Hello, Terry.

So, what do you think
of my new place?

It's not quite Croft Manor.

What? A key to your heart?

To a flat in Zurich.

You can pick another city,
if you want.

Your record will be expunged,

your citizenship restored.

By?

Ml6.

Ml6.

Now, would that make me Faust...

or the Devil?

Well,
you can pick one,

because Ml6 will also arrange
a new identity.

Oh, yeah?
You think I need their help?

Oh, having two faces
doesn't count.

So, what do I have to do?

You need to take me
to the Shay-Ling.

The Shay who?

There's a man named Chen Lo

who took something from me,
and I want it back.

Yeah, now, is that you

or Ml6?

Also, I've arranged
for the government

to wire you five million
in sterling when we succeed.

You can call it

second-chance money.

Or life insurance, for you.

I don't need any.

You and l, working alone?

Well, it's easier
to see through you that way.

So, what if afterwards,

Ml6 decides
that me back in the world

isn't such a great idea?

Then I feel sorry for whomever
they get to come after you.

Do you have authorization
to kill me, Croft?

Anytime, for any reason.

So, why don't you
just do it, then?

What is it they say?

"Hell hath no fury."

You're not that good.

The Shay-Ling
are like ghosts, Croft.

They move constantly,

and their home
is the most remote

mountain region in China.

Region?

You'll have to do better
than that.

Get me into China,

and I'll get you
to them in a day.

No guns, no money,

no weapons of any kind.

Talk about taking
the fun out of life.

The Shay-Ling have spies
all over China.

We have to get into
the country undetected.

So, we slip into Beijing,
and we go by truck.

Truck? Hmm.

I was thinking about something
a little faster.

A little faster?

Well, this is a little faster,

but the Chinese
will track the pod.

There won't be any pod to find.

Will there be
any of us to find?

Ready? Now.

Ready for what?

The ditching was good, Croft.

I'll give you that.

But we're never going to find
a vehicle in a place like this.

Oh, it's so lovely to see you.

So, is everything ready?

Yes.

Your clothes, guns

and knives are over there.

And I took the liberty
of tuning your bike.

May l?

Yes.

Lara.

Ah, what is
the happy couple up to?

Accessorizing.

Where are we on reading the orb?

All maps have a key, Lara,
a scale, a legend, yes?

The orb's key,
it's not on the orb.

It must've been lost.

Or is somewhere in the temple.

Go through every image I took.

Start with the ones
near the orb.

The key must have been linked
to it in some way.

Right.
Bye, then.

It's unlike Lara
to take a partner.

Where are you two going?

We'll take a nice little trip.

Breathe some fresh mountain air.

Stop by my friends,
the Shay-Ling.

The Shay-Ling watch
all the roads.

We'll have to go

around the back.

We'll go straight.

Maybe you didn't hear me.

The Shay-Ling have
men on every road

from here to Lo Yang.

Not every road.

A bit rusty, are we?

Oh, I think it's coming back.

I expected more from a Scot.

I don't expect anything

from an Englishwoman.

Good, 'cause you're not
going to get anything.

Fun's over.

From now on, it's by foot.

Best to reconsider
that "no gun" rule.

No.

Okay.

And don't be looking at my ass.

So, where do I fit in?

What do you mean?
You're the guide.

I mean, when you think back

on the vast scheme

of your
hugely adventurous life...

where do I fit in?

Was I the love of your life,

or just another bump
on the road?

Was I time well spent?

Four months?

More good than bad?

Come on, it had to be
more than that, am I right?

You're right.

It was five months.

-You're laughing at me.
-No, no.

At the fact,
I used to find you charming.

I am charming.

Hmm.

You're late.

Tilt your head back.

Do it!

You might see again
in an hour. Maybe.

What's this?

It's not there.

There's no orb.

Is there anything
you can tell me about this?

Hello.

I take it you didn't
like your messenger.

I didn't.

But I did like the men
I lost in the temple.

You underestimated
Lady Croft.

I underestimated how much
this orb is worth.

There's so many horrible
diseases in the world...

things we are particularly
susceptible to as children.

You never know
when you could be holding

Iittle Shiho or Tai by the hand

as a mysterious ailment
ravages their bodies.

You kill them, and I will give
your orb to Lady Croft.

My men tell me

she is a few miles away
from here, as we speak.

I wonder how much she would pay.

I'll pay you an additional
12 million dollars.

It will be yours,
once you've delivered

the orb to me,
along with Lady Croft's body.

I don't think you know
where they are.

You're impossible,
you know that?

I think you pretended to know,
so I would get you out.

This isn't a tomb, Croft,

and the Shay-Ling
aren't mummies.

They're killers.

But if you don't trust me...

I'm sorry to have to do this,
but you're wasting time.

You want to shoot me?
Shoot me.

Personally,
I'd rather you do it...

than them.

Well, Terry...

what part of
"Never come back again!"

didn't you understand?

You wanted to find
the Shay-Ling.

Come on!

The only way to get into their
place is as their prisoners.

Ah, you might have told me
that little gem before.

Ah, you would have believed me?

Make Chen Lo a better
offer than his buyer.

He'll cross them.

Even if his buyer
is Jonathan Reiss?

You might have told me
that little gem before.

Were you really
going to kill me?

Oh, I bet she would have.

I have seen her in action.

Didn't Terry tell you?

The last time any of us saw him,
he was riding away with a truck

full of my Ming vases.

And sitting next to him...

was his sister.

Well, how is she?

You... shouldn't
have come here.

It got me out of prison.

Besides, the lady
has a good offer.

Better than Reiss.

Really?

Should I take it?

Take it.

Or, better yet,

you and I ransom
her and the thing

back to the British for triple.

Let's talk.

Not you, Terry.

Lady Croft and l.

You wait here.

Catch up.

I'll be four minutes.

Terrific.

There's something

I think you will appreciate.

This is the largest group

of terra-cotta warriors
I have found.

The King of Chin made them
for use in the afterlife...

to fend off enemies
he made in this one.

Hmm. Sounds like we
could both use a set.

I would be happy
to sell some to you.

I hope you're as entrepreneurial
with the orb.

You lost men, I lost men.

I see no reason
we should both lose again.

If I want double what
Reiss offered me?

Is it here?

It's worth a lot.

Well, then, if you know that,

you know Reiss
will also kill you

the moment you give it to him.

And your government will
guarantee my safety?

No.

But I will.

That must hurt,
saying that to me.

Take the offer.

You presume to give me orders?

Take the offer,
before it expires.

No.

Then I will have to force you.

Then I will have to kill you.

Oh...

Has it been four minutes yet?

That was nice.

It's too bad
you're on the wrong side.

Tell me where the orb is,
and it spares your life.

The flower pagoda, in Shanghai.

9:00 p.m.

This is mine.

Now we're even.

Now!

Remember that "no gun" rule?

I reconsidered!

I know there's a staircase
we could've used.

I am alone

Then I swore

¡ÓWhen you were
the last... high¡Ó

¡ÓHigh...¡Ó

Lara, are you all right?

Smashing.

I'm on my way to Shanghai,

and I need you to look
at something for me.

It was in the Luna Temple
near the orb.

And I'm betting it's the key
to those markings.

She's holding some sort
of musical instrument.

It's sound.

That's brilliant.

The key must have been linked
to it in some way.

I'll start decoding

-the images we have.
-Good.

You get us the rest.
Bye, Lara.

-Bye.
-Miss you.

Oh, well.

Just like old times.

I think that's the first time

you've actually smiled
because of me.

Why did you do it?

I started thinking.

I was tired of doing things
somebody else's way,

and it was always going
to be somebody else's way.

So, you abandon your men
and betray your country?

Leaving my men and my country,

that didn't actually hurt
as much as I thought.

But leaving you did.

Mm.

You're a hard act to follow,
Croft.

You know why you and I get along
so well?

No.

We are two of a kind,
me and you.

We are nothing alike.

I don't think we're alike,

but I do think we're a pair.

Opposite sides
of the same coin.

My men have the roof covered.

Why don't you set down
in the square instead?

That way, my men will also
have things covered.

Okay, fine.

Okay, Sean, let's go!

They're landing in the square.

We're in the wrong position.

Stairs?

No time.

-Rooftops?
-No.

I've got a plan.

Stay here.

Wait for my signal.

Here's the money!

Come and get it!

Wait for my signal, huh?

Give me that box!

You give me my money first!
Come on!

Give me that box now!

No, just toss it.

You first!

Quick! Get us out of here!

Take us up!

Take it up!

Go! Run her over!

Yeah?

We tried it your way.

Now we do it mine!

Bring it to the top
of the pagoda now!

Okay!

I got you!

Come on! Come on!
Hold it up!

Come closer!
I can't reach it!

Raise it higher!
Higher!

My regards to your brother!

We're too late.

Croft, what are you doing?

Take us up!

Move! Go!

Let's go! Move!

I'm getting tired of you
pointing that thing at me.

Are you okay?

Never better.

Looks like we lost the orb.

Please. You don't think
I'd go vaulting into thin air

for nothing, do you?

I put a tracer on the crate.

Got it. Look.

Impressive.

A weapons lab

in the middle of the city?

No way.

He must've dumped that crate.

No, it's here.

One of the buildings?

No. It's exactly
where we're standing.

There's a part of me that always
allowed for the possibility

that Pandora's box
was just a legend,

but now I know it's there.

She escaped.

She has no idea where we are.

We take no chances.

Have everything we need
to manufacture an antidote

transferred to the jet.

I need an out for two people.

Mid-city. Soon.

What, are you crazy?

Are we set?

Piece of cake.

¡Ó...angels cry¡Ó

¡ÓTears from the moon¡Ó

¡ÓFall down like rain¡Ó

¡ÓI reach in vain...¡Ó

¡ÓI would've done¡Ó
