Hyah!

[ Bird cawing ]

[ Thunder rumbling ]

[ Laughing ]

Oh, my lord.

[ Laughs ]

[ Indistinct conversation ]

Let's go.

Dear friend, join us in drink.

Yes, brother.

You've had a long journey.

You must be thirsty.

This is no time for levity, Jason.

Malachy, it's your father.

He's ill, and I think he may be dying.

We need to leave.

[ Inhales sharply ]

Unlike you, Jason, your brother
never had a problem with

spoiling a perfectly good time.

You tell me...
Why should I leave?

He was the one who sent me away.

Get up now, or you will know
what it feels like to be run through.

Nobody told me I had to
bring you back alive.

Join us and drink.

Or meet the devil.

You know, the last man who
told me that is in his grave.

Jason.

So you will not drink with us.

[ Both grunting ]

This is not the time, Malachy.

You look well. Excuse me.

[ Grunts ]

Enough!

It's been too long, Erik.

[ Laughs ]

Brother!

Brother, do you honestly think
we've just been drinking and

whoring our way around the continent?

But of course we've done that.
Of course.

We've also been practicing our skills.

Every day. Every day.

Well, almost every day.

Almost every day.

[ Laughing ] Oh, you
are as good as ever.

Now, are you ready to leave?

Now I guess I have no choice.

[ Sighs ]

Hyah!

Hyah! Hyah!

Hyah!

[ Thunder rumbling ]

I cannot believe what has
happened to the kingdom.

I've never seen anything
like this before.

Come. We must hurry to
your father's side.

Time is short.

Hyah!

[ Sighs ] The gates are open.

Not when I left.

With this sword, I declare you
sovereign in place of your

father, who died defending
his people and his kingdom.

May you be worthy of this
ancient and holy symbol of rule

and serve and honor your people.

I should never have returned.

These people need a leader.

They need you.

[ Voice breaking ] I
have no bond with them.

You do.

I am a warrior, not a politician.

This is your birthright.

You are our king, Malachy.

As it was meant to be.

[ Bird cawing ]

[ Sighs ] I've never seen
it like this before.

Well, it stands to reason that
was the worst they ever had.

Erik, this is pathetic.

As I've already told you, it's
been like this for a long time.

It wasn't like this when I left.

You were gone, Jason.

How could you know?

Come, now.

We're here. We're together.

We can restore the kingdom.

Your father tried.

It took him years...
Tried to what?

To lose the respect of his people?

Look at them, Erik.

They do not mourn him.

Why would they?

Your father died trying to
save Dragonoff, Malachy.

Perhaps we should just
go back to the castle.

Perhaps a king should know his people.

With the greatest of respect,
sire, now might not be the

safest time to do that.

[ Scoffs ]

[ Gasps ]

It's okay.

You need not fear me.

Here. Take it.

Meat! They've got food!

[ Insect buzzing ]

We'll take it from them.

You have food!

Give it to us!

You will hang for this, maggot!
Erik, no!

They attacked us because
they are hungry.

We cannot blame them for that!

If you do not make an example out
of him, you will have anarchy!

Go!
Guards! Chase!

You will have to trust my judgment.

He's only been king for one day.

Give him time, brother.

[ Breathing heavily ]

We must go.

[ Thunder rumbling ]

And I doubled the guard on the gate.

No one will be able to walk in as we did.
Good.

I've also placed 20 sentries
at various points around the perimeter.

And I put locks on all of the doors.

You did?

So why is that door open?

Apparently that wasn't
enough, brother.

How did you get in here?

I can see you're not
impressed by my magic trick.

Perhaps something a
little more complicated.

Unfortunately, the effects don't
last for long, and afterwards,

the meat...Is terrible.

What do you want with us, magician?

My business is with the king.

I'm here to help him, and you,
defeat the scourge that killed

his father and has all but
destroyed the kingdom.

And you are?

Kramer.

Heinrich Kramer.

And what is this scourge you speak of?

Witches, gentlemen.

This man is clearly mad, Jason.

Throw him off the parapet.

Let's see what he has to say.

We could all do with a
bit of cheering up.

Perhaps he has some more magic tricks.

So you are suggesting the
failure of our crops is because

of witchery?

I do, sire, yes.

Explain yourself.

With pleasure.

What are these things?

That is a rapture stick.

Rather, it is a piece of one.

It is the prize of my collection.

Careful with that.

And this... this is the Belles
Finificus, my book of witches.

I found it in the ruins of a village.

Hundreds of people... men,
women, children... killed.

Terrible.

I've been trying to translate
it with some little success.

These are the tools of my trade.

And what trade might that be, sir?

I am a witch hunter.

I collect the signs of the dark forces
and record what I learn in my book.

There is much evidence of the
witches I seek here in Dragonoff.

And that fragment you hold in
your hand is one of the most

powerful conveyors of the dark
forces that I have found.

A witch's most-valued weapon.

With it, they can conjure the
blue fire of lightning, can

convey themselves as if on a
gust of wind, and, fortunately,

few of the items in my
possession are of use to anyone

who has not invited the
dark forces into his soul.

How convenient.

So I understand correctly, you
are here to warn us of witches.

And you wish for me to believe you?

Without proof, sir, I cannot.

Your father tried to silence me, too.

His refusal to heed me killed him...

As surely as if it had
been by his own hand.

How dare you speak such treason!

He was hiding something.

Why else would he keep you
ignorant of the state of the

kingdom for so many years...
sending you off as a child,

keeping you away.

You are either a very brave
man or a very foolish one.

There must be some...
Logical explanation for this blight.

Some strange manifestation of the plague.
Something.

I find it incredibly hard to
believe that all of our troubles

of the kingdom are because
of witches and spells.

There is no drought.

No disease.

Yet field after field is burned brown.

That is because the witches
are devastating the crops.

I can help you restore your kingdom.

My father... he tried, and he failed.

Are you implying that you could
succeed where he could not?

I need your assistance in
battling the dark forces.

I want you to go after the
witches and their queen with me.

I can teach you what I know,
but I cannot do it alone.

And why did you not enlist
the help of the villagers?

They won't believe me.

This is absurd.

There are no such thing as
witches, merely an invention.

Fairy tales told to naughty children.

There are no dark forces
coming to claim us.

You are much like your father.

Don't make the same mistakes he made.

Let me prove it to you.

This day, have your pages call your
people to assemble in the town square.

As entertaining as that
promises to be, I think not.

Well, if nothing else, he could
bring the rabbits back to life.

Let's give him a chance.

Very well.

You will have your chance.

My brother and I are watching you.

You'll be mindful of that, lunatic.

People of Dragonoff, I know
what causes the ills that have

befallen the kingdom.

It is witches who
move freely among us.

This book has shown me how to
root them out and eradicate them.

You must listen to me.

The end of days is near.

I have seen it with my own eyes.

It is witches that ruin the
crops and witches that threaten

the village.

They are among us even now.

There is only one way
to end the starvation.

We must burn the witches
... each and every one.

Theirs is an evil... I
believe the lack of food

makes your mind play tricks on you.

[ Laughs ]

We will feed you and give you water.

And you may continue on your journey.

Make it happen.

One meal for one man will
not make a difference.

My mind is sound.

You cannot ignore what
you see around you.

The kingdom and all its
inhabitants will perish unless

you heed my words.

You do not believe now, but I
will show you that mine are not

simply the words of a starving madman.

This powder, now the color of
oxblood, was once as bright as

that which flows through your veins.

It is of the witches themselves,
and will unmask the evil ones.

Erik.

You must stop this!

You! Stop this now!

[ People screaming ]

The powder has shown us our devil.

It is she!

The dust says she's a witch.

She must be burned.

Stop this!

What you've shown me is not proof.

It's nothing more than
misfortune carried by the wind.

Citizens, I have found
what ails your kingdom.

You must burn this witch.

Burn her!
Stop this!

He's mad!
I beg of you, believe me!

Believe me!
I am your king!

You must stop this!

Do what your dead king would not
and what your new king will not.

Burn her! Burn her!

Let us pass through!

Make way for your king.

Stop!

Let her go!

Let her go!

Make way for your king!

I beg of you, no!

Let her be.

Justice is being done.

Why do you still doubt?

You! You!

This is your doing.

You've taken the life
of an innocent woman.

I had no choice.

This is only the beginning.
She is but one.

There are countless others.

You are your kingdom's only hope.

You must act!
Hope? Hope?

I cannot even stop my own people
taking the life of a guiltless grandmother.

They care nothing of
hope and nothing of me.

She's here.

At long last, it is time.

Revel now, for time is short!

The red queen...Is coming.

[ Woman vocalizing ]

[ Thunder rumbling ]

It is blood!

From the heavens!

My God.

I still don't believe this charlatan.

You saw it with your own eyes.

The same as I did, Erik.

There has to be some
plausible explanation.

And what might that be?

Look, our only priority right
now is to defend the kingdom.

We must prepare for anything,
plausible or otherwise.

If this threat is real, and I
still don't believe it is, how

are we to battle a coven of
witches with swords, bows,

arrows, and potions?

Mock my potions if you will, but my powder
did exactly as it was meant to.

It saw beneath the benign
exterior to reveal the evil

presence within.

That's how they've infiltrated your
kingdom, sire... in the guise of innocence.

Well, enlighten us, Heinrich.

If they're so powerful, how do
you propose we defeat them?

Well, my book has shown
me some secrets.

Don't despair.

[ Scoffs ]

We cannot simply just stand here
and wait for the witches to attack.

He's right.

If what we saw today was any
indication, they have great power.

We should ride at once and
take this enemy by surprise.

It is our only hope of defeating them.

I've seen witches
here, here, and here.

Now, my book, I'm sure, shows
the location of their fortress.

So far, the translation of that
part has eluded me, but there is

this representation of a village.

I believe we'll find it here,
at the very edge of our land.

That's two days' ride from here.

That's where we saw the
worst of the devastation.

Very well.

We will leave immediately and
send word back when... if... we

find witches.

I am coming with you.

Your kingdom needs its leader.

Stay here where you're safe.

The kingdom will be
defended by its king.

Mile after mile of devastation.

We have water, yet the crops fail.

The witches leech the plant's
energy to fuel their dark magic,

like a vampire bat sucking
life from the land.

What's that?

[ Shrieking ]

Aaahh!

Should there not be guardsmen
patrolling this area?

Indeed there should be.

By the gods, they'll pay with
their lives for leaving their posts.

Calm yourself, brother.

I'm sure there's a
perfectly good reason.

Let's hope so.

For their sake.

Go now.

Get the witch hunter's book.

Pry it from his dead
fingers if you must.

Do not return without it.

Aaaahhh!

Still no sign of them.

It's quiet here.

Yes, too quiet.

Whoa.

Make way!

I said, "make way!"

By the gods!

I like this wench.

She's spirited.

Where are you and your friends from?

Casi.

Perhaps you've heard of it.

We find the pickingsasier here.

I should kill you right now.

You fight well, madam.

But you're clearly outmatched.

I would suggest you reconsider.

Leader of murderers and thieves
who've killed two of our men.

You were right.

The blight has affected them, too.

They fight well.

They would join us for a good cause.

Besides, we could use a few good men.

I am Malachy, your king.

I offer you this choice.

Join us.

We fight witches.

They intend to destroy the
kingdom and every one of us.

Or die here on this day.

Witches?

What nonsense is this?

You take me for a fool.

We've seen their terrible
power with our own eyes.

This fighting must end.

We are not enemies.

The threat is real.

Join us and you will
live or die with honor.

If you do not, I promise
you only a coward's end.

Make your choice.

We will join your quest.

I'm honored by the opportunity
to serve my king.

Ho!
What brings you so far from the castle?

We expected to see you
earlier in our travels.

But you were not at your post.

Two strange women approached us.

They attacked us, tried to draw
the very breath from our bodies.

They dragged us from the road.

We had to kill them.

Witches.

They flew through the air
on a cloud of red mist.

So they are dead, which means
we cannot question them.

Yet you are still not
at your appointed post.

While they pleaded for their
lives, they begged us to take

them back to their village where
others of their kind would pay

for their release.

It's not far... just across the mountain,
about half a days' ride.

We can take you there.

Finally, you may be of some use to us.

We camp here tonight.

We must make a good plan of action.

Learn as much as we can of this
... this witchcraft... if we

wish to have any hope of
bringing an end to this.

The book speaks of the hive-like
interconnection of their souls.

So it stands to reason, we take down
their queen, the rest will follow.

Then we must strike at
her first and swiftly.

What's this?

A fierce weapon for such a timid man.

I designed that crossbow with
a mechanism which rapidly

reloads the arrows.

It's fitted with a flame.

The arrow tips are coated in
animal fat which ignite when

they're ejected.

Fire is one of the witch's
greatest weaknesses.

This is good to know.

And what is in that?

Oh.

This is the greatest secret of all.

[ Chuckles ]

Ahh.

Delicious.

Continue with your story.

The village where everyone was killed?

Before he breathed his last, the
village elder was able to tell

me of a settlement of
devil-women and their leader,

the red queen.

Here is a passage about her.

It speaks little of who she
is, but there is this.

Erik.

She certainly has the
beauty of a queen.

Beauty, perhaps.

But from what I've been able to
translate, it seems she has no

capacity to feel love
... only pure hatred.

It could be the devil himself.

Herself.

Well, whatever it is, we need
to kill it before it kills us.

"Death will come to the one who
rules the fiery coven only"

if the essence she once shared
in love returns to her in full

"with grace and sacrifice."

A riddle.

"But take heed, for her power
grows if she partakes but little

of it."

[ Gasping ]

The queen will be pleased.

How would you like to be a toad
in your precious forest, witch hunter?

Aah!

Witches.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Please, sire. Spare me.

Don't listen to him.

He's been possessed.

He's not the man you knew.

I'm no demon.

From this moment on, we must trust
our instincts before our minds.

Leave nothing to chance.

Kill him.

[ Grunts ]

Jozefa?

Yes, my queen?

Do you bring me news of our sisters?

Surely they have retrieved
the hunter's book by now.

If they had, then they would be here
entrusting it to you, mother.

Surely so, my dear.

Unless they were dead.

Perhaps the new king has killed them.

Otherwise, they'd be safe within
the walls of this castle, and

the book would be here with me now.

I told you to retrieve the book.

Didn't you understand?

It must be destroyed.

Yes, my queen.

And the new king remain
unharmed in the doing of this

simple deed.

I see the resemblance.

I do.

Without it, I might not believe
you were my own blood.

I saw what those men did to Baba.

Barbarians.

You couldn't have helped her.

Could you?

But you have something
for me, haven't you?

Yes, m... [ Gags ]

He's coming, isn't he?

You're certain?

Hmm.

You abandoned our sisters
in the field, didn't you?

You never abandon the coven, Jozefa.

Never.

Speak to me. Speak.

They possessed the
bodies of the soldiers.

They did not need my assistance,
so I came to be by your side as

you had commanded me, mother.

What happened to them later
was not within my control.

I see all.

There is nothing that
remains hidden from me.

Nothing!

The coven fights as one.

There is no one beyond our walls who
ouldn't burn a witch given half a chance.

No sister shall stand alone.

From this, we do not stray.

We do not stray!

No, mother, we do not stray.

Their hosts have been killed, so their
essence is lost to the coven.

So be it.

Oh, leave me!

I'll retrieve the book myself.

[ Horse whinnies ]

[ Growls ]

Your highness!

Kramer, is this another
of your tricks?

Look at the eyes.

It's the same unholy red as
the mist of the fiery coven.

They are bewitched.

Kramer!

With this, be still!

Hurry. We must flee.

The effects might not last for long.

[ Sheep bleating ]

I hear no church bells.

And where's the steeple?

This town is cursed.

I've heard stories of travelers who have
come to trade and never return.

The picture.

Yes.

The men have their instructions.

They are ready.

We must find the red queen at once.

The book... Keep it safe.

The knowledge within it is
our only chance at victory.

We'll be fighting magic
borne of the devil himself.

We must fight for the people.

For the kingdom.

And for the memory of my father.

And for those innocent ones who've
died at the hands of these demons.

For those, too, madman.

Greetings, gentlemen.

Welcome.

Greetings.

It's a good morning for
trade, wouldn't you say?

Indeed.

I am Hobart, leader
of Cadistan village.

It's very rare we see
strangers here in Cadistan.

Your men, they seem weary.

Indeed.

Perhaps some refreshments
before market.

Your goods and horses will be
safe here until you return.

That's very kind of you.

Thank you.

Please, follow me to
the meeting house.

You can rest there.

You must be hungry.

Ale, my friend.

That's what I need.

Something's not right.

I'm gonna stay here, see
what I can find out.

Good. We'll be inside.

Look for the queen.

Meat, gentlemen. Dine.

Oh, you are a beauty, aren't you?

[ Laughs ]

Here, ladies.

[ Indistinct conversations ]

Here, right here.

M-more food.

Mmm. Mmm.

[ Laughs ]

Do you always dine so well?

And so early?

[ Chuckles ]

We have visitors so rarely...
It's cause for celebration!

More ale!

Yes, more ale!

I'll best you every time, traveler.

All right, then.

Best of three.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

This sport is childish.

How about something more challenging?

What do you have in mind?

Your blades are certainly
sharp, my friend.

Are you sure you know how to use them?

The last man who said that
to me is in his grave, sir.

[ Laughs ]

What shall we wager?

Nothing.

This is for honor.

For honor then.

May the first strike win.

Do you trust him?

No.

Have you noticed the numbers
increasing in the room?

Yes, I have.

Certainly doesn't seem like blight
and plague has affected this village.

Hmm. Definitely not.

We're wasting our time here.

The madman was wrong.

There are no witches here.

Come now, gentlemen.

This is a fight for honor.

Do not leave before it is satisfied.

We must go.

No more fighting.

I cannot let you leave, sir.

Do not offend me, since I have
shown you so much hospitality.

We appreciate your generosity.

Sire!

A devil that is free.

They are surrounding us.

How easily men are lured.

How easily they succumb
to flattery and ale.

Why do you toy with us?

Toy with you?

You came here to slaughter me.

You're after the blood
of the entire village.

You and your kind have
devastated the crops,

endangered my people, and you
intend to destroy my entire kingdom.

What would you have me do?

Your kingdom?

Now that you have set me free,
I'm simply here to take back

what is rightfully mine.

For decades I've been locked behind
the walls of this wretched village.

We know what you are.

And we will stop you.

[ Scoffs ]

Your pathetic army is no match for me,
even with your precious book.

You should give it to me now.

Save yourself a little bloodshed.

Give it to me.

You will have to kill me first.

Where is it?

Right here.

How do we kill them?

We don't. Let's go!

Sire, it's time to leave.

Damn it!

They're surrounding us!

Stay together.

Kill them.

Come on!

Behind you!

Erik!

Aaahhh!

Erik!

[ Weakly ] Jason... fight...
For the honor of our family...

For our king.

[ Exhales sharply ]

I swear it!

Aaaaaaah!

My king...

We must go.

I cannot leave him.

There's nothing you can do.

You must save yourself
and your kingdom!

[ Breathing heavily ]

Next time.

[ Scoffs ]

Take this one back.

I'll deal with the rest later.

The red queen is sure to pursue us.

We have unleashed hell.

Come on!

[ Breathing heavily ]

Good morning, pretty boy.

My, you're quite a catch, aren't you?

Go to hell.

Oh, such language.

I'm beginning to see why my
daughter is so taken with you.

[ Grunting ]

Oh, save your strength.

I think I found a use for you.

I'll tell you nothing, hag.

Torture me all you wish.

Torture?

Hmm. Indeed.

Aaaaah!

Aaaah!

[ Gasping ]

[ Grunting ]

I hope you're ready to
see your kingdom bleed.

[ Scoffs ]

[ Moans ]

Sire, you must talk to your people.

Let them know what's happening.

Prepare them.

They'll listen to you now.

Let them see your compassion.

People of the kingdom! Come!

Listen to your king!

I must warn you of the coming danger
that threatens every one of us.

What you have all been through,
no people should suffer.

I see your hunger, and I
understand your fear.

But we cannot, we must
not succumb to it.

What we have all seen, the death
of our comrades, our friends, it

was not the work of plague or blight.

This was the work of witches, witches
with whom we have fought already.

Witches with whom we have battled.

What happens to this
kingdom happens to you.

But it happens to me, also.

Because it is in my heart, my
blood, and in my soul, and for

that, I ask you, my people, to
help me fight this evil... this

unholy evil... that comes to
threaten every one of us.

How can we fight them?

We're too weak.

And what will you tell
your children, sir?

That they should die a
convenient death of starvation

while they sleep in their beds
at night, or they should stand

strong and fight this
evil that comes for us?

They are witches.

We have no magic.

What we have is better.

We have our witch hunter.

He showed me that we can
fight magic, and we can win.

Together with his book and our
strength, we will fight the

red queen and we will win.

We will send her and her
army of evil back to hell!

[ All cheering ]

Uhh!

You fight well.

There are few who can match me.

Particularly ones so beautiful.

When she gets what she
wants, she will kill you.

Pretty words can't save you.

She'd have done so already
if she'd intended to.

She intends to trade you for the book.

[ Scoffs ]

It won't work.

My king doesn't bargain with evil.

Then you will die.

I'm already dead.

I gave my word to protect what
is good and what is right.

And I have tried to
do that and failed.

It doesn't matter what
happens to me now.

Foolish.

Is your life so unprecious to
you that you would give it away

so freely for your king?

Because he would die for me.

Is there nothing in your life
important enough to die for?

I'd die for my queen.

Why?

I heard her speaking to you.

You're nothing to her.

She will kill you when
you're no longer useful.

You have to know that.

[ Sighs ]

Think and do what's right.

Let me go back to my kingdom.

[ Chuckles ]

If you help me, I'll help you.

I can promise you that.

You have something?

Here.

This one says "the ones who deal
the fatal blow must look the

ruler in the eyes and repeat
these words... 'not of my

mother, nor my father.

I am borne of light.

My faith, it surrounds me,
protects me from your might.

The earth, the water, the fire,
the sky... in our elemental

"combat, you shall die.'"

[ sighs ]

I fear... I fear I have
no command of sorcery.

Think of it like a prayer.

One that might save your
life and your people.

My lord... a strange cloud
approaches from the west.

Gather your men and your weapons.

I'll meet you by the castle's gate.

I have a plan.

His book, and then they
will leave us alone.

And you believe that?

None of this will end until
the red queen is dead.

And you know it.

Ready the archers.

Light the torches.

Ready? Go.

And prepare for battle.

[ All shouting ]

Sire...
You cannot stay here in the open.

Go.

Hide.

And if you die, who
will lead this battle?

Who will restore your kingdom
when the enemy has been defeated?

You have no heir like your father did.

I will fight for my people.

I'm of no use to them
behind locked doors.

Go.

You are a better, wiser man
than your father ever was.

I want to fight by your side.

You are a brave man, madman.

[ Laughs evilly ]

This is what the mighty king
Malachy calls his army?

We will make quick work of you.

Ready your weapons.

The prisoner, my queen.

[ Grunting ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

King Malachy!

Make yourself known.

Deliver me the witch
hunter and that book!

Why should I trust you, witch?

You know we have more power than you.

All I want is the witch
hunter and that book.

In exchange, I'll return your friend.

He's worth something, isn't he?

Do it and it'll be over.

Do you really think that
blackmail would make me betray

my people?

Your witch hunter is a charlatan!

Charlatan?

The north tower. Now.

My witch hunter seems to bother you.

Something's happening.

Let them eat fire!

Now!

Fire!

Get him!

The book.

Our future depends on it.

Make it safe.

You idiot.

Why'd you let him go?

I was trying to protect you, mother.

I'll show you how it's done.

Find the book!

Ready yourselves!

Forgive me, your highness.

You did not help me in life.

Perhaps you will do so in death.

[ Floor creaks ]

[ Grunts ]

What have you done to them?

They're under the red queen's control.

They're her slaves now, so she'll
do what she wants with them.

What will you do?

Kill you.

It's her wish.

You enjoy what little time
you have left, pretty boy.

[ Spits ]

[ Grunting ]

King Malachy.

Please...
Don't embarrass yourself anymore.

You are still king...
For the moment.

Why didn't you kill me?

Kill you?

You have the kingdom.

[ Scoffs ]

Why would I destroy the one thing
I have wanted all these years?

Next to escape from that dismal village,
I have waited only for you.

Me?

Why me?

Because you, Malachy, you're my son.

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Laughs ]

You're my son, Malachy.

My father told me my mother was dead.

Indeed.

A small part of me died giving
birth to you and your sister.

Look. Look.

No!

Your father was desperate for an heir.

When your sister was born, he
was disappointed, but it didn't

trouble him for long.

You arrived only minutes
after your sister.

Your father had his heir.

That night, you became ill
and were taken from us.

I did what any mother would do if she had
the power, but he was afraid of my magic.

He banished me.

I begged him... begged him... to
let me take you and your sister.

He allowed me to take my
daughter, but not his son.

"I curse you and your kingdom."

I have saved your son, and
this is how you thank me?

"You will regret this betrayal
until your dying day."

He lied to me.

He told you I died in
childbirth, didn't he?

Yes.

Oh, you are my son.

Otherwise, I would have killed you.

What do you want from this?

I was given a powerful gift ... the same
gift that you were born with.

There is no stronger bond than
that of mother and child.

Don't you feel the... the blood
running through your veins?

Oh, accept your parentage.

Together, we can reign in the triumvirate
of mind, body, and soul.

And sister is sword?

Yes. Jozefa.

She has the gift of dark
magic, just as you do.

We will be stronger than any
other ruler in the world.

Huh?

Never.

[ Scoffs ]

Look into my eyes.

See the truth.

I'm not going to hurt you.

Oh, don't be afraid.

It is not fear I feel for you.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Tell us where the book is, fiend.

Never.

Maybe you'd like to be
more comfortable, then.

[ Breathing heavily ]

No!

Nooooo!

What is it?

Your witch hunter has more
spirit than he displays.

Once more... where is that book?

Why do you reject this
power I'm offering you?

Why?

Because I am my people's king.

And I will die for them
before I tell you.

The people of your kingdom
will be my slaves.

I will rule them as I see
fit until you join me.

This is your doing.

Take him to the dungeon.

[ Grunts ]

You have a choice.

Or is killing me gonna help
you please your queen?

And then what?

Who else will you have
to murder for her?

Silence.

You're her executioner,
and nothing else.

[ Sniffles ]

And the king, your friend...
Is my brother.

But you, you are nothing.

If you will not give us the book,
then there is no use for you.

And what happens when you
are no longer useful?

Leave us!

Jozefa.

Jozefa!

I know there's good in you!

I can see it in you!

Jozefa!

[ Grunting ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

I have failed you, my friend.

No.

We must keep the book safe.

If we give up our knowledge of the black
arts, we will doom all humanity.

No. No.

Remember where you came from.

It's there you'll find what you seek.

I come from the devil.

The red queen...
I am her son.

My father banished her.

He kept the dark truth
from all of us for years.

Her son?

Do you know what this means?

Yes. That I am cursed.

No. You are blessed.

Remember what the book said.

"Death will come if the essence
she once shared in love..."

"It will return in full
with grace and sacrifice."

Yes, of course.

That's it.

Her blood, her essence,
flows through your veins.

You...You are the one.

Only you can kill her.

Jozefa!

Please!

Please, Jozefa!

I must ask, mother, when were you
going to share the good news

that I had a brother?

Is that all that troubles you?

I thought you were going to moan
about having to get rid of that

rather handsome young man.

No, it would have been nice
to know that I had a brother.

Someone to protect me.

Someone to share secrets with.

You know all about secrets,
don't you, my queen?

You grow tiresome, my child.

Why are you doing this?

I have waited years for
your brother to return.

Now the day has come when all that was
taken from me is about to be restored.

My triumvirate is only complete
when all three of us are together.

What?

Are we all to sit side-by-side
doing your evil bidding?

Enough.

Or what?

Will you have me killed, too?

What will that do to your plans?

Do you want to just take
that down for a moment?

I'm not a murderer.

You and I must kill the red
queen, whatever the cost.

Do you know where the
king's being held?

I'll take you there.

I will... I will kill you
for what you did to him!

I will kill you for
what you did to him!

Calm yourself!

Calm yourself. Calm yourself.

Calm yourself.

Not at her. Listen to me.

She's with us now, okay?

You're alive. You're alive.

We have to go.

We have to hurry.

We have to hurry.

Release him!

He was a great man.

[ Gasps ]

[ Sighs ]

My wait is over.

The time has come.

Make ready.

Show her no fear.

And show her no mercy.

How dare you interrupt the ceremony.

But no matter.

At last, my power will be complete.

It is not power we bring, mother.

It is death.

Children.

Do you not feel the energy
of the triumvirate?

We are together, stronger.

We will rule the world as one.

It ends here.

Now.

The light races through our veins.

We are here to kill you.

My will.

Jozefa!

Do not doubt our conviction, mother.

You are no match for us.

Your power is no match for mine.

I have taught you too much,
perhaps, but not everything.

Jozefa!

Jason!

What have you done to him?

Aaaaaah!

Aaaaah!

Jason!

Jason! Remember who you are!

She's not with us.

I am your king!

Are you with me?

I'm with you, my lord.

Mother.

I cannot, and I will not, allow
you to destroy my kingdom.

You're my son.

Malachy, we must do it.

[ Woman vocalizing ]

"Death will come to the one who
rules the fiery coven only"

if the essence that she once
shared in love returns to her in

"full with grace and sacrifice."

Not of my mother, nor my father.

I am borne of light.

My faith, it surrounds me.

It protects me from your might.

The earth, water, the fire, and
sky... in our elemental combat,

you shall die.

[ Grunts, gasps ]

Aaah!

We are victorious against
the army of evil.

But our victory has
come at a great price.

Today we honor a warrior, a
brother, and a dear friend.

A friend whose loyalty to the
kingdom, to my father, and to me

will keep his memory strong
for people and king to come.

Today we enjoy our freedom.

We live with hope.

We must let his sacrifice remind us always
that together we are strong.

Together...
We are Dragonoff.
