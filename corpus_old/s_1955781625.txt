I actually think it's getting
cooler each semester.

Last semester I regret...

They're all making me mad.

It's totally true.

Your teachers are really cool.
Trust me.

He did not.
He did not say that.

Girls please.

Brittany...
Show Haley your shoes.

They're so amazing.

No way!

Those are so cute.

No way. I love those.
Did you order them?

Those are so cute.

You're so lucky.

Those are so cute.
Aren't they amazing?

I am so totally jealous.

I wish my mom would get me
something cool like that.

My aunt got them
for me in New York.

They're one of a kind.

Absolutely nobody here
has them.

You're so lucky.

Ok Brittany this is your stop.

Uh no it's not.

Of course it is.

Not unless we got
a new front door

and they changed
the street numbers.

Are you sure?

Well is this anybody's house?

Nope. No.

See you tomorrow!

Wait!
It's almost 4:00!

No. I'm sorry but...

Mom!

What's going on?

Jordan.
Ahh.

Zap zap.
There. Done.

Now move it.
How did you...

It's taken me 3 months...

We're gonna clean.

It'll be pretty now.
Ok? Yeah.

We won't
do it again. Sorry.

Yeah yeah. Sorry.

Ow!

Uhh!

Heh heh.

I think you can safely cross
pop star off your list.

Homework done?

Yeah. Pretty much.

Ah then this game
is pretty much over.

Mom!
Better get started.

Jessie homework check.

You're kidding right?

Humor me.

I finished 2 hours ago.
This is just extra credit.

Although it would be
a lot easier to concentrate

if someone wasn't having
band practice next door.

Hmm.

â™ª The door â™ª

â™ª the door is closed â™ª

the door is closed on.

The door is closed...

Homework check.

Um my homework?

Mm-hmm.

Oh it's fine.
Really fine.

Oh the guitar.
Mm-hmm.

Um well you see I was just
coming up with one of those um

pneumonic memory
devices... thingies

for my geography quiz tomorrow.

Hmm.

So what does "the door
is closed on" stand for?

â™ª The door is closed on â™ª

well that obviously
stands for the States

that ratified
the little known...

Beyonce amendment.

Yeah uh door.

Delaware Ohio Oklahoma r...

Rhode island?
Rhode island!

Yes. See? That is exactly
what I was going to say.

See how helpful this is?

Hmm.

"The door is closed
on my dreams.

Life is being lived
far away."

First draft?

I don't know what

the fact that it's 8:30

and you still haven't
started your homework or...

Or that you really
feel this way.

Brittany...

Are you really that unhappy?

Mom...

Uhh!

Must you be so dramatic?

It's just a song.

Ever heard of a little
thing called teen angst?

Please don't give me
sad mom eyes.

Ok. Fine.

Do I want to be here

where nothing but
nothing ever happens?

No!

Or do I want to be out there
where exciting things

are always happening?

Yes!
Hardly a secret.

And yet I'm the one
accused of being dramatic.

If you want to do
something with your life

why don't you help me in my
save ashbrook house project?

So the complete
opposite of exciting.

I recycled for you.

I sold candy to save
the whales for you.

I thought you did it
for the whales.

I don't know any whales.

Please don't make me
help you save

a 100-year-old house
that nobody wants.

Ok. Fine.

What if I promise
to continue on

with my sad dreary
boring monotonous life

as if I'm completely
thrilled by it?

Deal.

Hello?

Jordan cahill's coming to town.

He's filming
his next video here.

Right here in the neighborhood.

Jordan's coming to town!

When did this happen?
How exactly do you know...

Wow.

Bet you really wish you'd
finished your homework now huh?

Heh.

Let's go people!

Don't forget.
I have a rally at 3:00

so you have to get coo to
karate and soccer by 5:00.

Oh and we have jessie's
science fair at 6:00.

3:00 5:00 and 6:00. Good.
Fairly light day.

Briefcase.

Oh honey that looks so...

Complex.

Hardly mom. It's just
recombinant DNA.

But I'm missing
3 nucleic acids.

Could they be small
round and something

you might use to play
fetch with the dog?

Mom!

Hey does this say

"please please put me
in your music video"?

More like please please
put me in a sweater.

Has anybody seen my brief...

Ha ha.
There's no way.

Oh come on dad please.

No. No!
Everybody's wearing...

Just a few teeth marks but
other than that good to go.

Oh mom they're
slobbery. Gross!

Have you seen what your daughter's
planning to wear to school today?

Cute. I think
she looks adorable.

Adorable? Oh!

Well played.
Thank you.

Check the counter
next to the phone.

I can't find my karate uniform.

Check the dryer.

Mom help!
It's broken!

Come on come on.
Cooper!

But it's still wet!

Well hang it out the
window when I'm driving.

Come on we're gonna be late.

Ok guys see you later.

Bye! Drive safely.

Ok.

Remember your seatbelt.

Ok. I think this
is definitely...

The one.

Hello? Oh no!

Wait!

No. Kind of funny was the
first time it happened.

Now it's just tragic.

Welcome to the land
of the middle child

a couple miles West of the
island of misfit toys.

Brittany!
Guess what?

Jordan's here and we're all
gonna be in his video.

You said guess.
Whatever.

I went online last night
and I found your shoes.

Uh my shoes?

You can't. You see
they're only from

this one little store
in New York.

Well that little store
has a Web site.

They're gonna be here tomorrow.

I got 2 different colors.

I wanna get some too!

We'll all match.

Brittany isn't that so cool?

Yeah. The coolest.

Good morning Jordan.

My cousin minnie thought she saw
him eating at Doug's diner.

But I said...

Excuse me.
I'm 214.

Cute. Is that
your boyfriend?

Ha. No.
Not exactly.

That's Jordan cahill.

Oh right. Sorry.
My bad.

Who's Jordan cahill?

You don't know
who Jordan cahill is?

'Fraid not.
I've been living in Europe

off and on for the
last couple of years.

Guess I'm not up with
the latest trends.

Apparently ponytails are back.

I'll have to make
a note of that.

So long story short.

But sports
just aren't my thing.

I'll wait over there
until you're done.

Actually the sun's
better over there.

You're on the goal with Aarons.

But I... uhp.
Could I please...

Uhp.

Move it.

All right let's go!

Hurry up hurry up!

Line it up kick the ball let's go!

Right through!

You're supposed
to try and catch it.

Yeah right.

Come on let's go!

Go! Lob up with that!

Hi. I'm Brittany.
I know you probably met

like a thousand
brittanys already.

There's actually
7 in our class.

I was thinking of
changing my name

to something more exciting

like Paris or...

Natasha.
Right.

I don't know if
I'm exactly a natasha

I was thinking something
like maybe arabella

or Naomi or francesca.

Uh no.
Natasha's my name.

Oh. I can see that.

It's nice.

So what are my chances
of getting out of this

with a dramatically
twisted ankle?

Not good. Mrs.
Dilemma's tight with the nurse.

Color me shocked.

So you really lived in Europe?

Well my dad
works over there so...

Summers breaks long weekends.

The rest of the time I'm with my mom.
New York.

New York City New York?
I love New York.

Not that I've ever been there.

The whole concept.

I really see myself
as more... [Gasps]

Uhh!

So what are you doing here?

I was apparently quite horrible
to someone in my past life

and my mother was transferred.

Ooh.

You're serious?

This whole athleticism
thing happens every day?

Yeah.

Oh good. Only 41/2 more
years till college.

Hopefully I'll get time off
for good behavior.

So what's the deal
with this Jordan guy?

Well he's ok I guess

but everybody else
is in love with him.

Well who wants to be part
of everybody right?

Right.

I'm home.

Good. You can help me
load this stuff...

Hello.

Mom this is natasha.

She's from New York.
Natasha this is my mom.

I'm just from here.
Nice to meet you.

Thanks. So um what's
with all the posters?

Oh please don't even
get her started.

She's trying to save
some old decrepit house.

I mean local landmark.

We'll be upstairs
in my... actually

you know why don't you let
her tell you all about it?

It is really kind of
fascinating.

Natasha's socially aware.
You're socially aware

aren't you? You seem like
you'd be socially aware.

She talks when she's nervous.

I noticed.
Ok. I'll be right back.

On the floor.
Have a sit.

â™ª A new day â™ª

â™ª it's a new day â™ª

â™ª as the sun comes up â™ª

â™ª start a new day â™ª

â™ª as the moon falls down â™ª

â™ª sleeping away â™ª

â™ª all the dreams of him â™ª

â™ª but memories fade â™ª

â™ª on the run â™ª

â™ª feeling numb â™ª

â™ª as the sun comes up â™ª

â™ª start a new day â™ª

â™ª as the moon falls down â™ª

â™ª sleeping away â™ª

â™ª all the dreams of him â™ª

we let them demolish
this beautiful old house

and we're losing the last
connection we have to our past.

We're thinking about
making a human chain.

I know. All she needs
are some humans.

You know it really was
kind of fascinating.

Totally amazing.

The city had a certain
Je ne sais quoi.

we went to tons of concerts

lots of theater and the
most amazing shopping.

It's official.
You're living my life.

Actually now I really
am living your life.

Well at least until
I can convince my mother

she's made a horrible
horrible mistake.

Hey do you play the guitar?

Oh. No not really.

Oh too bad.

You've got that whole

coffee house poetess thing going on.

Really? I do?

Knock it off you little creep!

Aah!

Because I'm actually
more into writing

than I am into playing.

Don't look at that!

Why not?
You're really good.

"An island of hope
in a sea of sameness."

I love that.

Really? You do?

Because no one has ever...

Hello.

Jordan's coming to Lafayette!

No way. That's just around the corner.
I'll be there in...

So...

Um you remember
that Jordan guy?

Well he's filming
just down the street

and I know it sounds
really lame

but...
we should go.

Really?

I mean you sure?

Yeah.

Watching all of his crazed fans

make complete fools
out of themselves

should be hilarious.

"Oh Jordan
I love you!"

Please.

Right.

Jordan I...

Love you!

Wow you're really good at this.

Uh thanks.

You know I figure
as long as we're here

we might as well...

There he is!

Love that hat.
Picked out that hat.

The hat works.
Am I wrong?

Jordan hey hey. Perfect.
That's exactly what I need you to do.

Check this out.
Come on. Look.

You see your reflection.

You splash your reflection.

You turn to camera.

You strike a pose.
You flip your hair.

You do that thing
in the music video

the girls join in
and boom! Big finish.

Next thing you know we're back
on the bus to civilization.

You got it?

No I don't got it all right?

What does any of this
have to do with the song?

I said I don't want to do
any more strut-strut-snap

girls appear out of nowhere...

Flip your hair stuff.

I couldn't agree
with you more bro.

That's why this time
we're keepin' it real.

Look the dancers don't come in

until after the hair flip
this time.

Places everybody.
Let's roll.

Roll camera.
We have speed.

Take one.

Playback!

Playback!

Camera one
let's go. Action.

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª ooh ooh â™ª

â™ª oh yeah â™ª Jordan I love you!

â™ª Girl â™ª

Jordan!
Jordan!

â™ª You're the fire in my soul â™ª

â™ª yes you are â™ª

â™ª oh girl â™ª

â™ª I need you
more than you can know â™ª

â™ª uh-huh yeah â™ª

â™ª baby you mean â™ª

â™ª the world to me â™ª

â™ª drive me crazy â™ª

â™ª can't you see? â™ª

I'm sorry. I can't do this.
Ok cut! Cut!

Len!

Stand by everybody!

Stand by please.

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

Hold on hold on!

Jordan I love you!

Looking great.

I don't want to
sing the song len.

It sounds like
everything else I've done.

Exactly.

Eddie where are my lyrics?

I don't know if you've read
the reworked lyrics I wrote

but I think they work
a little...

I read 'em and they are incredible...

For someone else.

Jordan your fans
want songs about love

getting it
finding it losing it.

They love you.

Someone peel the girls
off the window.

They're gonna leave a mark.

Ugh. Raisins. I'm not
a big fan of raisins.

Argh.

Pick out the raisins

and fire whoever
put them there.

See what I do for you?

I'm still not
doing the song len.

Ok. Ok. Hey
take your time.

Whatever you need.

You take your time Jordan.

Look I need a serious
attitude adjustment

by tomorrow or else.

Ok? Run run.
Run run.

Hey man you know
why don't we just...

Let's get outta here.

All right? And please...

Please remember to
download all my files...

To disk.
I know I know.

You've told me the same thing
every day for like 6 months.

I'm sorry man it's just my
whole life is on that thing.

Have a little faith.

I got your back man.

Thanks man.

Hey hey hey.

Suppose I want
to download everything

from a hand-held
to a disk.

It was kind of a bust.

We only saw him for
like 2 seconds.

I think I did some permanent
damage to my vocal cords.

Sorry.
Oh don't apologize.

Thanks to you I'm already
having more fun here

than I thought I ever would.

Unh! Man!

Jordan come back!

Guys wait up!

Guys I dropped some stuff!

Guys!

Hey guys wait up!

Jordan cahill I love you!

Talk about
your brushes with fame.

That was definitely
more of a trampling.

Are you ok?

Yeah yeah I'm fine.

Brittany!

I'm trying to call you.
Why don't you answer?

Oh sorry my phone
must be on silence.

Um...

Guys this isn't my phone.

Has anybody seen my phone?

Augh! Why isn't
he answering?

I just know that stupid roadie

who mowed me down has it.

He's not answering because
he's too busy calling China.

Please hold. Not a problem.
Not my phone.

Don't say that.
My dad is going to lose it

if he finds out I
lost my phone again.

Don't worry. He can't be
that hard to find.

He is on a bus
with a national icon.

Well they're staying at that
swanky hotel out by the freeway.

Well it's the only
decent hotel around.

Where else
would they be staying?

The only question is...

How are we going to get there?

I'm guessing a cab
is out of the question.

True.

But...

I've got the next best thing.

Sorry.

Sorry.

Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry.

Are you sure
she has her license?

She can build a rocket
that will get you to the moon

but that whole
hand-eye thing...

No talking ok?

You're distracting me.

Sorry!

But he has to be.

No one by that name.

No luck. He's not
even staying here.

Are you sure?

Yeah that's what the guy said.

Oh please. Let me
take care of this.

What are you gonna do?

You just have to act like you belong
and not take "no" for an answer.

But what if the answer
really is no?

Excuse me.

I just gave your
friend an answer.

But it wasn't an honest answer.

You've got photographers
on the street

and reporters in the lobby.

We know he's here.
You know he's here.

So let's just skip
this little charade.

Kip... may I call you kip?

My name is David.

Sure why not?

Hurry up!

Brittany
get over here! Now!

We're not some crazed
Jordan cahill fans.

Yeah. We don't even think
he's that cute.

Though definitely
cuter in person.

Yeah totally.
So much cuter in person.

I saw his hair
and it was like...

My point is...

One of his flunkies
has something of ours

and we'd kind of like it back.

So until we do
we're not leaving.

Knock it off jessie!
We'll be there in a minute!

Hurry up!
It's almost dinner!

Like I said
we're not leaving...

Very soon.

Eddie here.

I'm sorry to bother you sir.

Yeah. Raisins
get people fired.

Ok before you throw them out

be sure to give them
a lovely parting gift.

They're only like
the 1oooth fan

to use that excuse to get
up here to see Jordan ok?

Oh we need Mayo too.

Who was that?

Some schmo at the front desk

says a couple of girls were
trying to convince him that...

Convince him that what?

Hey look!
The thing! It fell!

Come on! I know you can
walk faster than that!

Oh man!

What are you doing anyway?

You were in there forever!

Hey stop those kids!

They got my phone!

That was a total waste of time.

Tell me about it.

Ok nobody distract me.

Wait!

Wait!

Oh no!

What was that?

My brain rattling
around in my head?

I don't see anything.

Ok. Whew.

Hey...You got
the wrong phone.

Unh...

Unh.

Hi.

Hi.

Hi.

Hey you don't happen to remember
Jordan's cell phone number do you?

Please remember.
Nope.

He's changed it so many times
who can keep track?

Doesn't matter though.
He's here.

Jordan Eddie is looking for ya.

Hey don't I pay you
to keep track of him?

I shouldn't have to tell you.

I'm playing.
I'm playing.

What's up?

Nothing.

What's up with you?

Eddie...

I'm sorry. What?

Heh heh.

You go first.

I'm sorry. What were
you going to say?

I'm sorry for pulling that full-on
rock star act this afternoon.

Dude you're a rock star.

It's what you do... throw hissy
fits trash hotel rooms.

Do you think I was wrong?

That song is about nothing.

Yeah.

But I mean it's got a good beat

something you can dance to.

Look I mean 3 years ago

you were singing
in your basement.

I was backing you up.

Now you're singing
in stadiums man!

I'm backing you up!

You got everything
you ever wanted.

Is this what I wanted?

Oh man you are like the whiniest
rock star I've ever met.

Let me know if you ever
want to change places

and that includes
dating Penelope.

Penelope. Oh thank you
for reminding me.

Eddie...

Did you do something
to your forehead?

This thing is like a gazillion
times nicer than mine.

You'd think somebody
would want it back.

I mean tv Internet access.

Well you need a password
for most of it.

I used to have one just like it
when I lived in Madrid.

You lived in Madrid?

And my dad won't even
let me have Spanish rice

because he thinks
it's too spicy.

Whose phone is it?
What happened to your phone?

Oh you're gonna be so busted
when dad finds out that...

Get out!

Ok.

It's you.

I mean it's your phone.

I mean...

Here.

Hello?

Look you little thief
I want my phone back!

Just return it and there
will be no questions.

I didn't steal your phone!

I tried to bring it back
and I got yelled at

for being 20 minutes late
for dinner

so if anybody
is stealing it's you.

Whoa hey calm down.

I am calm!

I am calm.

I'm sorry. I guess
I was just afraid

about it falling
into the wrong hands.

The wrong hands?
It's just a phone.

And all I want is my...

Um hang on. I've got
another call coming in.

No no see you don't have
another call coming in.

I have another call coming in.

Ok. Yeah right. Sorry.

Do you really think it's her?

We'll call you back.

No no don't don't
don't don't don't!

Hello? Madonna?

It's her!
It's her! It's her!

Hi! This is...

Hello?

She hung up.

Maybe we shouldn't have
screamed like that.

Brit...

You know whose phone
this is don't you?

This...

Is Jordan cahill's phone.

Aah!

I don't know why I did that.

Natasha?

Your mom's...

Here.

And Brittany yours is
highly suspicious.

Thank you so much for letting me
stay over for dinner Mrs. Aarons.

Don't do anything
till tomorrow. Promise?

Promise.

Promise.
She promises.

Honestly.
Let's go.

What part of reality
don't you understand?

All I'm saying is

I just don't think
you know Madonna.

That was me caring for one
second what you think.

Oh but don't worry.
I'm over it.

Natasha you are so funny.

Isn't she funny?

Yeah! Not.

Bye-bye.

Ok first off
you don't know Madonna.

You didn't even
talk to her. I did.

And second

you can't tell anyone
about this phone.

It's like a total
invasion of privacy.

I've been thinking about it all night
and we've got to give it back.

You really are impossible.

"Oh natasha nothing
ever happens to me.

"Oh natasha
my life is so boring.

"Oh natasha...

Do I really say
"oh natasha" that often?

The point...

Excitement has fallen
into your lap

and you want nothing
to do with it.

It's him.

Pick up pick up pick up.

Hello?

Where have you been?

I called you like a
million times last night.

Why didn't you answer?

Sorry. Lights out
at 10:00.

We know whose phone this is.

Listen I am sorry
for yelling at you

and I am sorry for
taking your phone

but can we please please
just meet and trade phones?

Sure no problem.
But first we want to talk to Jordan.

What?

Yeah fine
no problem. Sure.

Hey Jordan can you
come here for a sec?

Yeah here I come.

Hey how's it going?

Ok Jordan just for
security purposes

could we get you
to sing a few bars of...

Your multi-platinum hit

the live recording not
the dance version remix.

Yeah sure no problems.

â™ª Penel... â™ª

wrong.

They sweeten my voice in post.

Look you little twerps.
I need that phone back.

No Jordan no phone.

For all intents and purposes

I am Jordan.

I handle every aspect
of Jordan's life.

Just give me back that phone.

Repeat after me...

"No Jordan
no phone."

Fine. But can you at least
give me Gwen Stefani's number?

Jordan keeps asking for it.

Gwen Stefani?

Save ashbrook house!

Honk to save ashbrook house.

This is what I get for not having
more after-school activities.

Yeah well this is what I get

for not having
any other friends.

This place is so cute...

An island of hope
in a sea of sameness.

Not exactly what
I was going for.

Besides unless
my mom can generate

some serious
community awareness

next week it will be a gas
station and a coffee place.

Wait isn't there a coffee
place just 2 blocks over?

Yeah but I could walk
to this one.

Honk to save ashbrook house.

Honk if you feel sorry for me.

Honey! Hey
good job sweetie!

Jordan's getting
his hair done today.

Ok thank you.

Highlights.

So?

So...

Hello it's Louise.

Oh hello Louise.

This is natasha Jordan
cahill's personal assistant.

Jordan's people.

What are you doing?

Yes I'm sure
you're very excited.

Id just like to go over a couple
of ground rules with you Louise.

Uh-huh.

Never look Mr. cahill
directly in the eye.

Always kneel before
you speak to him.

And remember
he only eats raisins.

Got that?

Oh and Louise

he wants all of
his hair cut off.

Yes. You want it all off?

That's right.

Ok. Bye.
Thanks. Bye!

No no no no no not his hair.

We cannot cut
Jordan's hair off.

Oh relax. No one's gonna
let her cut Jordan's hair.

And voila!

Aah!

What have you done?

Raisin?

Thanks mom.

So I was like there's
no way I got one wrong.

Check it again.

And so he did and I was right

so he had to raise my grade
and lower everyone else's.

Oh honey!
I know!

I knew I didn't get one
wrong though.

I mean heh you know?

Dad can I get a cell phone?

No. Ask me
in a couple years.

I want to get
one of those new ones...

With tv reception

and Internet access.

You know kind of like
that one that Brittany...

Whoa! Whoa!

Honey are you all right?

How many times have I told you
not to lean over in this chair?

Sit.
I'll get it.

I'll get it.

Ok. From what
I can tell

the world is coming to an end

and a boy named Jordan
cut his hair.

What?

And the golden mane is gone.

Let's hope his fans
don't go with it.

No word yet from Jordan's
record company or management.

I can't believe we did that.

I can't believe they did that.

No Penelope it really
doesn't look that bad.

That bad?

Not that bad?

I am holding you
personally responsible.

What did... me?

It's not Eddie's fault.

It's just hair.
It'll grow back.

Besides this is how
I used to wear it.

Before you were famous.

Don't you get it?

The hair was the money.

Then dress it up and make it
sing your lousy songs.

Heh. Everyone has to
have an image.

Part of yours was...Oh.

Oh.

New song new look new image...

Heh. I'm a genius.

Crisis averted.

Will be the premiere

of a whole new
Jordan cahill image.

We'll just have to have a
couple of days of reshoots.

Call Rolling stone.

tell them if they
give us the cover

we will give them the exclusive
on Jordan cahill's new look.

You're still writing.

You're now turning.
You're walking.

Good. That's a start.

Cool.

So I guess I'm off the hook.

Eddie...

I know what really happened
this afternoon.

The salon said that someone called
from my personal cell phone.

Jordan I can explain.

Thanks.

I mean I was gonna tell...

Thanks?

All I ever do is whine about
wanting to make some changes

but never do anything about it.

Half of my career has
been about my hair

and now it can be about
me and my music.

Thanks for giving me
the push I needed.

You're a good friend.

Well yeah. Sure.

I mean that's
what I'm here for.

Oh hey can I get my phone back?

Yeah sure.

There you go.

Thank you.

Um it's not working.

Oh man my bad.

You know after
I called the salon

and downloaded all your
data like I always do

I must have forgotten
to charge it!

I am such a fool!

Eddie! Eddie!

Don't beat yourself up.
It's ok all right?

I'll have to call Penelope back
from the hotel phone.

Thanks.

You know...

I really don't look half bad.

Whew.

He writes his own lyrics?

I can either pummel you
within an inch of your life

for being in my room again

or you can help me break
the password on this thing.

You know you've got
dirty socks under here

that are older than I am.

Password.

What's this guy's birthday?

4-1-82.

You're in.

He uses his birthday?

Nah.

He's over 14.

Everyone over 14 just uses
the factory setting.

They're amazing.

They're moving
and spiritual and sweet

about wanting to see
the world live life...

They're about the same things
I write about.

You two were practically
separated at birth.

See his version
of More than me

is all about feeling
trapped and isolated

and wanting to be different.

What are you wearing?

Oh just a little something
I threw together.

Cute.
Thanks.

Anyway he misses his dogs
and his girlfriend

and he loves playing
flying saucer golf.

Wait. What's that quaint little
expression you used before?

Oh I remember!

Invasion of privacy?

Don't you understand?

See the Jordan we see
isn't the real Jordan.

They're forcing him
to do all this stuff.

They?

I don't know "they."
His people.

Like that guy who won't
give me my phone back.

We need to help him.

Why should we help him?

He didn't even call us to thank
us for the fabulous haircut.

So operation
save Jordan was launched.

Of course there was no reason

I couldn't make a few
positive changes of my own.

â™ª If I were you
I'd be taking it easy â™ª

â™ª kick back and relax
for a little while â™ª

â™ª I'll still be here tomorrow â™ª

the first thing to go
was that tacky Vegas wardrobe.

Much better.

â™ª Reach out
for a comfortable chair â™ª

â™ª 3 jumps throw your arms
in the air â™ª

â™ª 'cause it's a good life â™ª

â™ª so why y'all trippin'? â™ª

â™ª the good life's
slippin' away â™ª

â™ª it's a good life â™ª

â™ª so why y'all trippin'? â™ª

â™ª the good life's
slippin' away â™ª

I might still have
writer's block

but I knew how to
brighten up Jordan's day.

â™ª It's a good life â™ª

â™ª so why y'all trippin'? â™ª

â™ª the good life's
slippin' away â™ª

â™ª and if your boss
is givin' you pressure â™ª

please? Please?

No!
Please!

No.
Please!

No.
â™ª what's your pleasure? â™ª

â™ª in time you'll be singing
like a lark â™ª

â™ª pretty soon you're sorry â™ª

â™ª watch out for all â™ª

â™ª somebody
will heed your call â™ª

â™ª reach out
for a comfortable chair â™ª

â™ª 3 jumps throw your arms
in the air â™ª

it's amazing what new hair
will do for your attitude.

â™ª It's a good life â™ª

â™ª so why y'all trippin'? â™ª

â™ª the good life's
slippin' away â™ª

â™ª yeah it's a good life â™ª

â™ª so why y'all trippin'? â™ª

â™ª the good life's
slippin' away â™ª

â™ª it's a good life â™ª

â™ª why y'all trippin'? â™ª

â™ª crazy â™ª

â™ª can't you see? â™ª

â™ª give me your love â™ª

â™ª I'll give you my heart â™ª

â™ª it felt like forever baby â™ª

â™ª right from the start â™ª

I'm sorry.

â™ª Bright as the moon â™ª

I'm sorry guys.
Len it still isn't working for me.

Thank you.

You two think you're
pretty smart don't ya?

Well not really. I mean
my grades were decent.

Heh. Thought you'd
get away with this

and I wasn't gonna even notice.

It wasn't us I swear.

Besides remember I said
I wasn't this smart?

Mmm.

Although you gotta admit
he does seem a lot happier.

Heh heh heh.

Oh yeah.
Warms my heart

to see him walk off the set

with a smile on his face.

2 years ago Jordan was a nobody

playing in a basement band

and you were nobody's friend.

One more surprise...
just one more...

And it's back to the basement
for the both of you.

Do we understand each other?

Yes.

Excellent. Now I want you
to be a good little minion

and go convince our star to sing
the song I want him to sing.

Go go go go.

Hey Eddie.

â™ª I'm not gonna
give up my tears â™ª

â™ª and let love pass me by â™ª

â™ª I know I'll find â™ª

â™ª what I'm praying for â™ª

Brittany!

I loved it!
It was great!

Did you really like it tasha?

Because it totally
just came to me.

I'm serious. I loved it.

Well usually it takes me
forever to write a song

but this one...
no no. I liked the part

where you said "through
the open door."

Yeah.
It's a...

It's totally great.

Well listen I think
I hear a banana split

calling my name so I'll
talk to you tomorrow ok?

Bye.

Oh I know I know.

How stupid am I to care so much
about a condemned old house?

It's not stupid.

A tad obsessive perhaps...

More sympathy less levity.

Hey...

Since when is it
stupid to care?

You're fighting for
something you believe in.

It's one of the reasons
I love you so much

and it's what makes you you.

Much better.

I just wish I could
make people understand

that that house...

Is the last thing that makes
our little corner of suburbia

the least bit unique.

An island of hope
in a sea of sameness.

You know the other day

I pulled into
the wrong driveway.

Really?

Well don't give up yet.

After the big rally on Saturday

who knows what'll happen and...

Oh I know.

7 people are scheduled
to attend Saturday's big rally.

8 if I could get at least one
of my own children to show up.

Well I'd probably
only count on 7.

Yeah.

It's all right.

Ok Brittany now
it's my turn to talk.

This has got to end
do you hear me?

And I got a news flash
for you little missy.

You're not helping Jordan.

You're destroying him.

Uh this isn't Brittany.
I'm calling Brittany.

Who's this?

Uh wrong number!

You know him?

I know Jordan.

Natasha I've got
to talk to you.

I had the most brilliant idea.

What's everyone...

Do you really know
Jordan cahill?

Ok you can tell me.
Tell me.

So do you know Jordan
or don't you?

Yes.

I so wanted to tell you.

I have his phone.
I know everything there is to know

about him.
We made him cut his hair.

You did that?

Totally.
Actually it was...

Something had to be done
about that unruly mop.

It wasn't even your idea.
It was mine.

The new clothes the new look all me.

I can make him do
anything I want.

Oh and I talked to Madonna!

So did I.

Can we meet him?
Please please please?

That's my brilliant idea.

Uh wait.
Where's natasha?

Who knows? Who cares?
What's your idea?

You can all see Jordan tomorrow

at the save ashbrook
house rally.

Is he going to sing?

If I say so.

What?
That's the deal.

Jordan sings at
the rally tomorrow

and I give the phone back.

No. There's absolutely
no way. It's impossible.

He has to. I've
already told people.

Well that's not my problem.

But it has to be your problem.

Natasha where are you?

Ok fine.

If Jordan's not there tomorrow

I'll erase everything
on his phone.

Including his address book

his to-do list

oh and all the songs
that he's written.

No no no.
You can't do that.

Those are the only
copies I made.

I never downloaded them.

And that's not my problem.

So 2:00
he'll be there?

Yes. He'll be there.
Excellent.

Whoops. Gotta go.
It's the girlfriend.

Hi Penelope.

No. This is
Brittany.

Let's just say I'm a friend.

Flying in on Saturday?

Ooh no. Saturday's
bad for Jordan.

I'm pretty sure
he's already booked.

Ok. Bye-bye.

I just can't believe
Jordan cahill

is really going
to come to my rally.

You can believe it.

We are so proud of you honey.

How'd you even pull this off?

You know this isn't really

supposed to be
my night to clear.

Jessie please.
Your sister's trying to tell a story.

You just have to know
who to call.

I explained what it was for

and they were more
than happy to help out.

Well I'm still amazed
you even got through.

I'm not.

You can be excused mister.

Oh I am just so excited!

This is going to be
a real protest rally

with songs and speeches
and celebrities!

With all the press
and the publicity

the city's going
to have to declare it

an historical landmark.

Oh! This is going
to be so much fun!

I don't know if fun
is the right word.

I'm guessing Jordan's gonna
be a little depressed.

Depressed? Why would
he be depressed?

He just broke up
with his girlfriend.

Or actually they're saying

that she broke up with him.

No.

Do you sense we're not
getting the entire story?

Lately nothing seems
to be going right

for the prince of pop.

He's now hairless loveless

and insiders tell us

his new video
is behind schedule.

Is Jordan's reign
finally coming to an end?

No!

We're supposed
to be helping him.

Wow you must feel horrible.

Ooh!

Hi Brittany.

I was beginning to wonder if I
was ever going to see you here.

Hi um is natasha here?

I called her like a
gazillion times last night

but she never answered.

She's in her room.
You can go on up.

Thanks.
Brittany...

I just wanted to tell
you how happy I am

that natasha met you.

She is so shy

sometimes it's hard
for her to make friends.

Shy? Yeah right.

And by the way we are
going to have a barbecue

if you want
to swing by tomorrow.

Natasha's dad's coming home.

Home? Here?

Of course here.
He's been traveling lately.

Paris? Rome? Madrid?

Actually mostly around Buffalo.

Stationery sales keep him
on the road all the time.

It'll be good to have him home.

Sure.

I've been living
in Europe off and on

for the last couple of years.

The rest of my time
I'm with my mom.

Mom this is natasha.
She's from New York.

The city had a certain

we went to tons of concerts

and the most amazing shopping.

I used to have one just like
that when I lived in Madrid.

I-I'm sorry
I just...

I don't know why
but I thought...

Never mind.

Hey!

Why didn't you call me back?

We are in serious trouble.

Look we're not
in anything together.

Ok maybe I shouldn't
have told people

that Jordan would
come sing at the rally.

But you've got to help me.

Why should I help you?

So you can take all
the credit again?

You think I want the credit

for breaking up
Jordan and Penelope?

Ha. Wow.

Is there anything you won't do

to be the center of attention?

Me...Me?

Your mom thinks
that you have no friends

because you're shy.

Well I know the real reason.

It's because you're a liar.

Me? Me?

What about you?

"Oh I'm not really a Jordan cahill fan.
" Please.

You love him.

"I lived with my dad
in Europe. I'm fabulous."

Your parents
aren't even divorced.

Your dad is a salesman.

So? And I never
said they were.

And I am fabulous.

It's the only reason
you even talk to me.

I talked to you

because I felt sorry for you.

You talked to me because
you thought I was cool.

More like pathetic.

Ok well if I'm so pathetic

then how come you're so
desperate to be just like me?

Nice outfit.

Yeah. "I wanna be
different.

I wanna stand out."

Well newsflash.

There's absolutely nothing
unique about you.

That's not true.

Calling me a liar?

Your life's a lie.

I should've never
listened to you.

I should've just given the
phone back when I wanted to.

Oh like this is all my fault?

What is going on here?

Yeah. Have fun
at your rally!

Say hi to Jordan for me!

â™ª Did I hear you say â™ª

â™ª whatever? â™ª

â™ª turn and walk away â™ª

â™ª forever â™ª

â™ª was it my mistake? â™ª

â™ª or did we just â™ª

â™ª get too close? â™ª

â™ª until we meet again â™ª

â™ª I think you better learn
to live â™ª

â™ª for the sake of living now â™ª

â™ª until your heart
is breaking â™ª

â™ª give your all
and don't hold back â™ª

â™ª tell the truth
and don't forget to laugh â™ª

â™ª laugh â™ª
â™ª till your body's aching â™ª

â™ª cry â™ª â™ª cry â™ª

â™ª till your hands are shaking â™ª

â™ª wherever you go â™ª

â™ª wherever you go â™ª

â™ª whatever you do â™ª

â™ª don't live a whatever life â™ª

do not yell at me!

I am sorry that
I kept the phone.

I am sorry that I said
Jordan had to sing.

And I'm sorry that I threatened
to erase all of his songs.

I'm sorry for everything.

I just wish none of this
had ever happened.

And I wish you'd told
me that an hour ago.

What?

Because then I wouldn't have
had to tell Jordan the truth

so he could come sing
at your little event

then he wouldn't have found out

that his life is being
controlled by 2 teenage girls

then he wouldn't have
disappeared.

Disappeared?

What do you mean
he disappeared?

I mean
that's it. Ok?

He ran away.
He had enough.

And it's all your fault.

Nice job!
Wait! No!

This can't be my fault too.

Was that him?

Who? Jordan?
No. He's long gone.

Ok.

Hey guys.
We going somewhere?

Yeah. Going on
a little field trip.

We are going to find that
ungrateful little punk

before the press
gets ahold of this

bring him back here and
talk some sense into him.

Ok. Just curious but how
do you expect to find him?

He has his phone
on him doesn't he?

Oh yeah sure.
Why don't you give him a call?

I already tried that.

See I'm not going to call him.

I called the phone company and
activated his global find.

See those high-end phones

have a global tracking device
in them so you never lose them.

Well there is a thing?

Did everybody know
about this thing?

Shut up and get in the car.

Oh!

You got a minivan?

It's all they had.

Did you find him?
Is he ok?

I'm fine.

Jordan?

I hear you have my phone.

I am so so so so so so sorry.

I never meant for you and
Penelope to break up.

Oh. Don't blame
yourself for that.

We were breaking up
with or without you.

Taxi!

And I love your songs.
I'd never erase them.

More than me
Is so beautiful.

Yeah right.

No. The version
you wrote.

I kind of might have accidentally
broken your password.

Not real big on boundaries huh?

Again. Sorry.

But why don't you
record that version?

Well that's the multi-million
dollar question literally.

Taxi!

Uh you're never gonna
catch a taxi.

This is the suburbs.

Yeah. I'm starting
to figure that out.

The record company owns
me and my next 6 albums.

If I want to record

I have to record what len says.

But you can't just give up.

You're Jordan cahill.

There he is!

Hey what are you doing
with Jordan's phone?

Chase her. Hurry up.

Chase her.

Aah!

â™ª Hey hey â™ª

â™ª hey hey â™ª

â™ª hey â™ª

anybody home?

Mom and dad are setting
up for the rally.

Hey! Shouldn't you
be there?

I'm leaving if you
want to come with me.

Please please pick up.

I can't.

I'm not home.

Oh!

I am so sorry.

Everything you said
about me is true.

I just wanted
to be your friend.

And I just wanted you
to like me.

And you've traveled
all over the world.

And you have such great friends

and you're so good
at everything you do.

And you're so cool

and you have all
these great clothes.

I think I was just
jealous of you.

Oh shut up.
I was jealous of you.

Shut up. [Gasps]
I didn't tell you.

I talked to Jordan.

Really?
What did he say?

He ran away.
He's getting out

of the music business forever.

Because of what we did?
No. Actually

I think he loved
everything we did.

Well except for the threats

and the extortion but pretty
much everything else.

It's his record company.

They won't let him record

any of the wonderful
songs that he's written.

That's so wrong.

Hey isn't he supposed
to be singing

at your mom's rally
in about an hour?

That's probably not
going to happen.

And I was so finally
starting to like my life.

It could still happen.

But we've got to find him
and get your phone back.

Not really all that worried
about my phone right now.

No. I've got
an idea.

Cooper!

I'm never wrong.

Later. Let's go.

Yes!

Jordan please just stay
right where you are.

We'll be there
in like 5 minutes.

I swear. I don't think
he trusts me.

I'm really sorry about this.

Where's Jordan?

I might have
forgotten to mention

the part about the thugs
trying to stop us.

You think?

Aah!
Aah!

Aaaaaaah!

What're we going to do?

Let's cut through
the McDonalds' yard.

That way!

Brittany?

Hi Mrs. McDonald.
Hi Devon.

Hi.

Brittany...

Yes Mrs. McDonald?

Can you babysit Thursday?

Um Thursday.
Yes. Sure.

See you then.

Slow down.
Wait up.

I'm wearing these cork sandals...
fabulous for everything

but walking
and eluding bad guys.

Aah!

Thought maybe
you could use this.

But how did you know?

Back of the door.

Thank you.

Stay out of my room
you little brat.

Oh I don't do helmets.

But this looks really pretty.

Amazing. A completely
new direction for Jordan.

Oh watch out!
Careful.

Sorry. My assistant is
driving like a maniac today.

Ok. Bye.

Do you know CNN's number
off the top of your head?

Why? You just
promised

channels 7 5 and 11 an exclusive.

Exclusive is
a very relative term.

Whoa! Look out!
Aah!

â™ª Trying to make some sense
of it all â™ª

â™ª but I can see
there is no... â™ª

combed cotton
acid washed jeans...

Fabulous for everything but riding
on the back of a mountain bike.

Hang on.
We're almost there.

Hey do you think we could... no!

â™ª I don't that I can
take any more â™ª

â™ª clowns to the left of me â™ª

â™ª jokers to the right â™ª

â™ª here I am... â™ª

sorry! Gotta go
find Jordan!

Your phone is at
123 orange blossom.

Your phone is at
124 orange blossom.

Wait wait wait!
That was orange blossom!

No. That was
lemon blossom.

125 orange blossom.

126 orange blossom.

137 orange blossom.

â™ª ...Slap you on
the back and say â™ª

â™ª please â™ª

want some?

No. Kinda busy.

â™ª Ple-e-e-ease â™ª

aah!

You did that on purpose!

Where are you?
I told you to wait.

What do you mean
you got hungry?

Relax. I'm only
2 blocks away.

Yes. I'll stay
out of sight.

Bye.

Oh cool.

I haven't had
one of these in years.

Uh-oh.

He should be
around here somewhere.

Isn't that...

Come on.

Hi. I'm Brittany.
The girl from the phone.

Oh hi Brittany.

I'm starting to think
that you were right.

I should've waited.

Oh and this is natasha.

Hey.
Hi.

Oh before I forget...

When I was on your phone
j-lo called.

It's her birthday next week.

Casual. No presents.
Thanks.

Soccer practice is
canceled for tomorrow.

Good. I'm so behind
on my homework.

Think we can maybe uh...

Oh sure.
Follow me.

Oh here. I think
this belongs to you.

Thank you.

And as nice as this is

pink just isn't my color.

Then what was that
you were wearing

in the Take my heart
Video?

Um before you get too attached

just one quick thing.

Brit...

Hit universal set.

All right.
Now the whole world

has your lyrics
to More than me.

what do you mean?
That's not possible.

Well maybe not the whole world

but pretty close.

Hello?

â™ª Oh yeah â™ª

â™ª and you â™ª

â™ª help me rise above â™ª

â™ª the pain? â™ª

Jordan!

Jordan I love you!

â™ª I've been so lost â™ª

â™ª baby now I'm found â™ª

â™ª ever since you â™ª

â™ª been around â™ª

aah!

Someone just sent me the lyrics
to More than me.

that was supposed to
be a world premiere.

We haven't even finished
shooting the video yet.

Wait a second.

These aren't even
the right words.

Wait. These are
Jordan's lyrics.

And it says that he's
premiering it today.

This afternoon.

This afternoon? Ha!

No no no.
There's no way.

There's the bike!
They're in the park!

Ah ha ha!

Come on. Just give
the guy a break.

Len this is wrong.
You can't do this.

He's got a right not to sing.

Definitely he has
a right not to sing.

He doesn't sing for me
he doesn't sing at all.

Boys...

No. Wait!

Grr!

Let go of me.

Ok. Ok.

Where are they?

Sorry. Sorry.

Um I'm not so sure about this.

The singing or the driving?

Both.

But I'm trusting you two.

I owe you that.

You gave me my life back.

And maybe ended your career...

And life.

Apologies.

No. Not... not ended.

Actually you brought it
full circle.

This is where it began.

You grew up here?
You grew up here?

Hey.
Trying...To drive.

Um no but a place
just like here.

I spent the whole time
desperate to find a way out.

Now that I'm out I...

I don't know what
I'm searching for.

An island of hope in
a sea of sameness?

Hey that's pretty good.

Do you uh do you mind
if I use that sometime?

It's not mine.
It's Brittany's.

She writes songs.
No I don't.

She does too.
Does not. Does too.

Do not. Does too.
Does not.

Does too. Do not.
Does too.

Ok. Maybe a little
but not like you.

Well I certainly hope it's
something you're going to pursue.

Eh. Someday
if I ever get out...

You can be stuck
anywhere you know

but you can't blame
the location.

You can only blame yourself.

Suburbs are just
a state of mind.

Sorry.

Are you sure you don't
want me to maybe...

I'm fine.
I'm fine.

Thanks but if you
could just not talk

that would be great 'cause
I'm driving. Thanks.

She has control issues.

And legend has it

that president Truman
once used the bathroom.

And those are the 57 reasons

why ashbrook house
is so important to me.

But it's already 2:3...

Actually I just thought
of another one. Ha ha.

That brings us to number 58.

Where's Jordan?

Yeah.
We want Jordan.

We don't care about
your stupid old house.

Now just one minute.

This house
is very important to me.

Jordan or no Jordan.

Did she just say "no Jordan"?

I knew it.

We're so out of here.

Right. Like Brittany actually
knows Jordan cahill.

We want Jordan!

We want Jordan!

We want Jordan!
We want Jordan!

We want Jordan!
We want Jordan!

We want Jordan!
We want Jordan!

We want Jordan!
We want Jordan!

You're drooling on yourselves.

Hi. You must be
Brittany's mom.

If you can give me
just like 2 minutes

we're gonna try
to save your house.

Sure. Um yeah.
Just uh...

It's that...
where you...

I'm Brittany's mom.

I know.

Congrats.

Uh-oh.

Trouble has just arrived

on the wings
of a tacky minivan.

Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

Isn't she fabulous?

Mmm. Not half
as fabulous as you are.

Thank you.

Mom...
Mm.

Ok. Sorry.

Ease up there young lady ease up.

Thank you.

I'll take care of the press.

Exhaustion.
Publicity stunts?

Ooh. Despondent over the
breakup with his girlfriend.

Great. Sympathy factor.

I want you to find Jordan

and make sure he doesn't
go through with this.

Yeah. Uh...
But how?

You're his best friend Eddie.

That should count
for something.

Oh and Eddie
if you can pull this off

I'm prepared to make you
part of the organization.

Maybe even let you
manage the tour.

I'm on it.
Mm-hmm.

Come on Jordan.
The porch is this way.

Uhh. How can you
be nervous?

You were on the grammys.

Yeah. I know but this
is all about me.

It's... it's personal.

And it's a really good feeling.

I'll be fine.

Thank you.

No. Thank you.

You know what?
Hang on just a second.

I forgot something.

I'll be right back.

Jordan...

What're you doing?

I'm just doing
what I think is right.

You want to
sacrifice everything

that you've been working for?

Everything that
we've been through?

You realize this could
be the end for us.

Yeah.
I realize that Eddie.

I'm sorry.

Fine. You do
what you gotta do.

But I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

Eddie wait!

Ladies and gentlemen
if I could have your attention

for just one second please.

This should explain everything.

I would like to introduce

my best friend
in the whole world

Mr. Jordan cahill.

No!

What is going on?

I'd like to thank everyone
for coming out here today.

I know this isn't
the biggest cause.

It's not going
to change the world.

But that doesn't mean
it's not important.

We spend our whole lives
chasing after things.

"I'd only be happy if"
dot-dot-dot.

But I think a lot of the time

we forget
what we're leaving behind...

Our past our home

what makes us unique.

This song...

Is dedicated to what's
special in all of us.

It's not what's out there.

It's what's in here.

â™ª Ba-la la â™ª

â™ª ohh â™ª

â™ª you take away
the lonely pain â™ª

â™ª oh yeah â™ª

â™ª and then walk so far â™ª

â™ª and we can't â™ª

â™ª see â™ª

â™ª this place anymore â™ª

â™ª take a day off â™ª

â™ª give it a rest â™ª

â™ª so I can forget about
this mess â™ª

â™ª if I lighten up a little bit â™ª

â™ª then I will be â™ª

â™ª if I lighten up a little bit â™ª

â™ª then I will be â™ª

â™ª over it â™ª
