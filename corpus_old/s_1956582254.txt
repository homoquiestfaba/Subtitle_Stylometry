Mm-hm.

DOYLE:
Any sharp objects, needles,

knives I need to know about?
No, sir.


What's up with all
the aggression, man?

What did you
just say to me?

Keep your mouth shut.

Nothing.

DOYLE:
That's what I thought.

Running your mouth.

I could blow your head off
right now.

No one
would even care.

[SHUDDERING BREATHS]

Anything going on
back there?

Nah. We're clear.

I am so tired of coming

to keep your mouth shut

and listen
when an officer's talking.

You understand me, boy?

Anything?

Nothing. Nothing.
Really?

He's clean.

to tell me so badly?

That no one's here.

I thought I heard

I got spooked.

Just wanted

You know, wasting police time
is a criminal offense,

but I'm gonna

She gonna glue it.

[FAUCET RUNNING]

Ah...

So that's where you went.

Did you really get footage

of them cops
killing them boys?

Yeah.

So, what you gonna do?

I'm gonna get it into

No, no, I'm good.

I need to upload
this footage first.

No. Somewhere else.

Talk to me.
What the hell happened?

I was rolling with Brown.

He got a call
on his cell,

and next thing I know,

we're at some
abandoned power plant,

and there are narcs killing
what I can only assume

were drug dealers.

They tried to kill me,
Kevin.

Holy shit.


All right.

So, what are you gonna do?

I'm gonna upload the footage,

and once it's in
the system, I'll call I.A.

I.A.? No, no, no.

Or the Feds.
Whoever deals with this.

Slow down.
Think about that.

That's gonna
make you a rat.

So?

Just think about it
for a second.

You want to can
Malone's ass?

Fine. I mean, get him
and Smitty off the street.

Yes, but have
the captain do it.

All right? Nice and quiet.
You bring in I.A.,

and, I mean,
your career's over.

a blue in the city

that's gonna
have your back.

[CONTINUES

How do you know
it was Malone and Smitty?

What?

You just named them.
How do you know?

I don't know. I mean,
you must have said.

No. No, Kev.

I said "narcs."
Jesus. Come on.

Partner, look at me,
all right? It's me.

[TIRES SQUEAL]

All right, take it easy.

It's me. All right?

Jesus Christ.

Are you armed?

I was.

Put it in park.

Empty your pockets.
Come on...

Empty your pockets.
Come on.

You are making
a monumental mistake.

No, I don't think so.

Where were you taking me, huh?
To Malone?

I'm taking you to the Fourth.
Oh, bullshit!

Why did Malone
murder those kids?

I'm not saying shit.

Yes, you are.
No.

I'm asking you why.

I'm telling you
I am not saying shit.

Goddamn it!

I am not playing
with you.

All right? I will shoot you!
All right!

[BREATHES HEAVILY]

He didn't murder them.

Okay?
He silenced them.

What are you talking about?
They're his sellers.

Look, every drug bust,
Malone splits the take.

Half goes into evidence,
half back on the street.

That's how it works.

Why kill them?
Have you seen the news?

The chief, the mayor,

they're cracking down
right now.

Six cops just got
busted last month.

Malone's
cleaning up the shit

before the spyglass
turns on him.

Brown rolled up

She got trigger-happy.
She shot a kid.

Now she is in the wind.

You're telling me West killed
a kid and now she's a ghost?

Yeah.

Problem is,
it wasn't just a kid.

It's Darius Tureau's nephew.

That's a problem.
Why didn't you call it in?

It wasn't that...
I told him not to.

My guys got

I don't know if you've

I.A. is looking

Cap, I'm all over it, okay?

We're looking for her

she's out there alone,

she's dead.
She won't live the night.

No, you can't touch him.

Triple-Nines.

Unofficially, it was a cop.

is a liability...

Yo, let me ask you

Now, how could you

I tried.
MALONE: Shut up.

Who is she?
Let me see.

Alicia West

from the Ninth Ward.

In and out of juvie.

Joined the Army
when she was 17.

Two tours
in Afghanistan.

Jesus Christ.

You know that?

You know that?
She said she was in the Army.

MALONE: Graduated the
academy with honors.

No family, no kin,
no emergency contact.

Woman is a ghost.

She gets that camera back
to the station,

and each and every one of us
is going to prison. Understand?

This is your fault.

Why'd you
bring her here?

I should drop you
now,

you stupid
son of a bitch.

BROWN:
You kidding me?

MALONE:
You.

Did you let her go?

Did you let her go?
No.

You didn't let her go?
No.

What else you know
not in those papers?

I-I don't know.
What else?

Friends.
She got a guy she's banging?

She got somebody?

Say something!
All right.

I don't know, man! Look,

I would tell you, all right?

You know I would tell you.

The only person
that I've ever seen

that she even maybe knows is
this-this guy at this market.

That market, is it...

St. Claude
and Andry?

Yeah. How'd you know that?

MOUSE:
There's nothing out there.

When's the last
time you slept?


I don't remember.

You should probably
get some rest.

It's gonna be
dark soon.

You got
to leave out.

Can I ask you
something?

Why did I become a cop?

Yeah.

I was gone a long time.

Lived in a lot
of different places, and...

after a while, I stopped
seeing enemies or allies.

I just saw people.

Not good, not bad. Just...

folks trying to figure
life out like I was.

And then, after my mom passed,

and I was here, home...


I just wanted to help.

Food banks and
