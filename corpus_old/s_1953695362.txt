<i>(Gull caws)</i>
<i>- Man: You know,</i>

some people
don't like Brooklyn.


Me, i...

I think it's the land
of opportunity.

It's a place, you know,
where a man can

rise up and

build his dreams here,
you know?

It's-- overcome

<i>any obstacle that fate</i>
<i>sets in his path.</i>

For instance,

an obstacle that has been
set in my path

is the federal bureau
of investigation.


And by striving

to overcome that obstacle,

i found that the FBI...

Are suspiciously

well-informed as to...

The time and place...

Of certain
confidential transactions

on which
my business depends.

And a number of these transactions
occurred on your watch.


<i>Which makes me wonder if--</i>

if you might be the source
of that information.

(Mumbling)
(Laughing)

Okay.
<i>(Chair scraping)</i>

Well, this concludes
my introductory remarks.

I'm now going to turn

the proceedings over
to Mr. white.

<i>He's going to crush</i>

<i>and mutilate</i>

various portions
of your body

until he's convinced

he knows your thinking
on this matter.

(Chuckles)
(Grunting)

Yeah.

Man: You wanna talk?
This what you get right here.

(Moans)
Yeah, baby!

Hey, rat, look at me. Look at me!
<i>(Choir singing)</i>

Look at me, bitch!
Man: Whoo!

That's how you do it.

Woman: <i>Greg?</i>

<i>(Classical music playing)</i>

Greg, you don't
wanna be late!

Greg?

Greg!

Never marry, my son.

Your father's parting
words of advice.

I heard that.

(Men laugh)

Is your brother
home yet?

<i>(Rock music playing)</i>
<i>- (Laughs)</i>

(Girl laughs)

Hey, that's a lot
of salvia.

Guy:
<i>Oh, that's a lot, dude.</i>

Oh, dude, it's all right, calm down.
(Groans)

Oh, there he goes,
there he goes.

He's gonna trip out.

Come on, come on!
Shit, dude-- (Shouting)


It's the Internet
superstar.

10,000 hits
since last night.

Dude, check it out.

<i>(Laughter)</i>

Oh my God.
I can't feel my fucking hands!

<i>(Shouting, swearing</i>
<i>from phone)</i>

Woman over p.A.: <i>Bobby kroupa,
please report to the principal's office.</i>

<i>Bobby kroupa,</i>
<i>please report to the principal's office.</i>

Hey, Dylan.
What's up, guys?

Dylan, my man.
What's up, dude?

All right.
What's going on, man?

All right. See you after practice, all right?
Yeah.

<i>(Car honks)</i>
<i>- Give it up, d.</i>

Oh shit!
Give it up, d!

Get the fuck off me!
Where's that secret bang for tonight, man?

You'll know when i know, dude.
Hey, man, give it up

or you're gonna have to carry me home.
I ain't playin' with you.

Brooklyn somewhere, man.
I told you, i don't know yet.

Man, Brooklyn? No.
Yeah.

You're shittin' me right now, no.
I'm shitting you not, man.

Delacorte's opening
a club out there.

A sorta last-outpost- of-the-empire kind of thing.


So that's that guy
you're talkin' about, right?

That be throwin' all those amazing
parties and stuff like that?

That's the one, yeah.

Hey, too cool, man.

Too cool for you, man.
Just don't embarrass me, dude.

Who, me?
Hey, is Chloe gonna bring that new girl with her?

I don't know.
You gotta ask her, Dylan.

I need her to be there.
I need her to be there. She's gorgeous.

Can you ask her or something like that?
(Girl laughs)

Dylan: <i>She's right there, man.</i>
<i>Why don't you ask her yourself?</i>

It might be better. I know she likes me.
I'm just sayin' in general.

Hey, guys.
What's up, Chloe?

Get a room.
Mmm, hi.

What's up, Jessica?
(Huffs)

We've been
through this, Sam.

You're way
too young for me.

You just turned 18
last week.

Well, then you're a week too late, right?
(Laughter)

Chloe: <i>All right, so?</i>
<i>- Dylan: So?</i>

<i>What's up with this secret plan of yours tonight, huh?</i>

I'll pick you up like,
uh, like 9:00, okay?

I don't know.
It depends on where we're going.

Mm-hmm.
We're going to Brooklyn.

Chloe: <i>Brooklyn?</i>
<i>- Yeah, it's in Brooklyn.</i>

What? As in Brooklyn?
My parents don't let me go to Brooklyn.

Why would you tell
your parents?

Who's this?
She's fine.

I mean, it could be fun.
It could be like a safari or something, right?

(Laughter)
<i>Shut up! Right?</i>

It's a Simon delacorte deal, guys.
It's gonna be good.

Chloe: <i>Babe, that's tight.</i>
<i>- Dylan: So 9:00?</i>

Chloe: <i>Yeah,
I'll see you at 9:00.</i>

All right.
Bye.

Jessica: <i>Come on.</i>
<i>- Girl: Okay, let's go.</i>

(Girls laugh)
Hey, so I'll see you later, Jessica, all right?

She's feelin' me, man.

Aw, he's too much.
He is so sweet.

I don't why you have to be so mean.
Then you date him then.

He's cute.
Don't get me into this whole thing!

Dylan's cute, come on!
But look at you:

"Oh yeah, Brooklyn sounds
like a great idea.

That should be fun."
Shut up!

"Pick me up at 9:00, baby!
I'll be waiting for you."

Shut up.
It's gonna be so much fun.

Man, i cannot believe
you're hittin' that.

Can't-- just can't believe it.
What can i say, man?

Sweets come
to the sweet, my friend.

What can i say?

You were all over him.
All right.

How do i dress
for Brooklyn, okay?

I don't know. Barney's?
Uh, duh, scoop?

Oh! Totally scoop.
Yeah.

Girl, you are so ignorant.
You so ghetto.

(Laughter)
All right, you guys, we need a cab.

Look, right here.
Okay, here.

Where to, ladies?
70th and Madison.

All right.
Here we go.

Yo, man, i gotta bounce.
Give me the ball.

Go-- go long.
Get outta here.

Whoo!
It's on tonight!

So how was your day, master Dylan?
(Chuckles)

Hey, uh,
this thing tonight,

this is an opportunity that i got you,
you understand?

Yeah, i know.
No, i just wanna tell you something.

You know,
up here with your friends and school,

you're the big man. But, uh,
where I'm taking you...

Okay?
I know, i know.

You're Gandalf,
you're Xavier.

I bow to you.
Whatever. Look, just follow my lead, you hear me?

I know, all right?
Okay.

<i>(Rock music plays)</i>

Greg: There he is.
Oh, there you are.

Oh, ma,
you're lookin' hot!

How was school?
School was excellent.

I aced my chemistry test,

and Ms. somerset said she might
read my essay out at assembly.

<i>That's wonderful,</i>
<i>sweetheart.</i>

News to warm the cockles
of a father's heart.

And there is nothing like warm cockles, right?
(Greg laughs)

Ms. somerset did always have
a soft spot for you jocks.

Well, look who came in
for a visit.

Good to see you too, Dylan.

Logan is home
for the whole weekend.

Isn't that a nice surprise?
Aw, sweet.

Doesn't Harvard need you
on weekends too though?

Translate emergency
Latin or something?

(Speaking Latin)

Well, look at you.
You are getting so smart.

<i>What does that mean?</i>
<i>- Yeah, Logan, what does that mean?</i>

Didn't you say something
about being late?

Oh! Oh, yes yes yes,
we have to go.

Oh, hey, wait, you're not
taking Ernie, are you?

I just need him to take me and
some friends to a party later.

Dude, where would you go?
It's not like you have any friends.

I'm supposed to pick up Lindsay at her thing at bam.

Then take a cab!
Hey, don't fight, boys.

Work it out, you two.
Dad!

â™ª Bye!

Hey, see ya, dad, mom.
Have a great time.

Listen, you smart-ass fuck,
I'm going to this party.

Find your own
goddamn ride.

Yo, and that Latin, huh?
What's that mean?

It means
"when did the assholes

make you their king?"

<i>(Techno music playing)</i>

<i>â™ª So love me or leave me...</i>

Here's to Brooklyn, baby.

Brooklyn!
(Excited chatter)

<i>â™ª I feel good</i>
<i>with you gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm too fly to just die</i>

<i>â™ª wipe that hate</i>
<i>from your eye â™ª</i>

â™ª and should i change my number
<i>or move real far? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Because no matter where i go</i>
<i>it's like there you are â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª and should i be a paranoid,</i>
<i>have to watch my back... â™ª</i>

(Cheers)
Whoa, hey!

Oh ho ho ho.
We got more space!

Bitch, hey,
where you going?

(Laughter)
<i>Sam, chill.</i>

Girl, this is my side!
Hey hey hey!

Hey!


You ready to party, huh?
Hell yeah!

Whoo, come on!

Have that.
(Gasps) It's a full bottle.

(Cheers)
Dylan: <i>Yes!</i>

Yes!
Are you ready?

<i>â™ª Ever i want right now,</i>
<i>yes, I'm free... â™ª</i>

Jessica: <i>Ooh, vikings.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

I don't know what that is,
but it's gonna be go-oood!

Somebody went to a pharm party, right, dyl?

Not exactly.

Hey, don't i always
come through?

Yes!
You do.

Always coming through.
Always!

All right then, okay!
That's mine though.

What do you want?
Yeah!

A little something really--
yo, could we turn this music up, please?

Turn it up. Dude, the whole way.
Turn it up.

All the way, all the way.
All the way!

Whoo!
<i>â™ª my mind...</i>

<i>â™ª It's my dilemma,</i>
<i>should i change my number... â™ª</i>

Um, I'm good.
I'm just gonna smoke a joint tonight, yo.

A joint?
(Laughter)

You're joking.
That shit is so last year, man.

Last--
Jessica: <i>Awww.</i>

(Sniffing)
Jessica: <i>Yo, you guys!</i>

Hey, yo, dude,
what's your brother doin' here, man?

<i>What's up?</i>
<i>- He's an asshole, that's what.</i>

Actually, I'm doing you
a favor by dropping you off.

Oh, fuck you.
I don't know. He's kinda cute.

Can we invite him
back here?

Sam: <i>Come on, man!</i>
<i>- Yeah, come on, Logan.</i>

Come on back here.
Come on, baby! Have some fun with us.

The ladies love you
back in here. Come on.

<i>Hold on, hold on, hold up.</i>
<i>- (Laughter)</i>

He's such a tight ass.
Jessica: <i>Tight ass.</i>

<i>(Laughter)</i>

This you usual Friday night?
<i>(Muffled cheer)</i>

Come on.
They're kids, all right?

<i>(Vocalizing)</i>

Yes yes yes yes!

Oh shit, look at 'em!
Go buck wild!

That's what I'm talkin' about!
Whoo!

Yo, my-- my turn. My sh--
i got my shot right here.

I'm ready for a shot.
Drink it.

Whatever.

Yo, that's fucked up.
That's funny.

I was tryin' to--
(Laughter)

Dylan: Shit, man, that's rough.
<i>(Phone ringing)</i>

No, shut up, shut up.

It's my dad.
Turn the music down. Shh!

Turn it down!
Quiet!

Hi, daddy.

Daddy? (Snickering)
<i>Hi, daddy.</i>

That's crazy, man.
Oh, it's you.

Shh.
What do you want?

A fuckin' mess? All right, cool,
then you clean it up.

What, are we suddenly
on the planet of no maids?


All right, you know what?
Tell my dad.

Yeah, good luck with that.

Oh my God.
Yo!

<i>- (Laughter)</i>
<i>- (Music volume increases)</i>

Stepmom-- whatever.
Yo, turn this shit up.

You're too cool for me.

Is that a cop?
<i>(Muffled cheer from back)</i>

No, I'm all right.
We're all right.

What happened, Ernie?
What?

What?
You.

You used to always be
the one to keep us in line.


Oh, look at the college boy coming
home and telling me my business, huh?

It's not easy, you know.

10 years I've been around
picking you kids up,

making sure you're okay

when your dad was off
on his business trips

<i>and your mom was off doing</i>
<i>whatever the hell it is she does.</i>

<i>(Horn honks)</i>
<i>- Hey, come on. Let's go!</i>

Go back to Jersey!

All that caring and all
that stress, you know?

But old Ernie was there, right?
Ten years of doin' this shit

and I'm tired, you know?
I just, uh,

I'm still behind the wheel,
you know? I'm still opening doors.

<i>(Cheers)</i>
<i>- Oh my gosh.</i>

<i>Ernie's fed up.</i>

<i>(Woman vocalizing)</i>

Whoa, Brooklyn!

Hell's yup!

<i>(Club music thumping)</i>

<i>(Honks)</i>

<i>(Kids laughing)</i>

Dylan:
<i>Whoo, yeah!</i>

Come on!


Ernie, what are you doing?

I'm just gonna make sure
it's all right.

Sit tight, sit tight.
I'll be right back.

Let's go! Party!
Jessica: <i>Party!</i>

Girl: <i>Here we go! Party!</i>
<i>- Let's go. Come on, kids!</i>

I'm not waiting in that line.
Not a problem. We're not waiting.

Go right up.
Right up to the front.

Brooklyn, make some noise!

You know what it is,
you homeboys! Break your needle!

Ladies, put your hands up.
You know what it is, man.

Thug: <i>Whoever's talking to the feds</i>

This guy's moving all around--
canarsie, Harlem, midtown.

There's only one man
doin' that.

The collector.

Hey, yo, <i>jefe?</i>

I got a source
that'll soon tell me

who the fuckin'
<i>raton</i> is.

My cousin, who works
for the Brooklyn task force,

he's bangin' this hot chick

Please. Save the story.
<i>(Door opens)</i>

Hey, yo, Simon.
Yeah, smalls.

<i>You got a visitor.</i>

Fellas.

Ernesto.

How delightful
to see you, man.

Good to see you.

Sorry it took so long.
The traffic was fucked.

It was unbelievable.
Simon: Yeah, huh?

Whew!
So i brought that kid with me tonight-- Dylan.

I figured you guys
could have a little chat.

<i>(Hip-hop music playing)</i>

<i>Move it to the left a little.</i>

<i>Me, i like that.</i>
<i>I like that right there.</i>

<i>New York, baby,</i>
<i>let's go, let's get it.</i>

<i>â™ª if we want a hand, we'll earn the stage show too â™ª</i>

Look, Simon,
i know the clubs have been good to you,

but this kid could
bring in whole new markets,

you know?
He's... he's got contacts in all those,

you know,
ritzy private schools on the eastside.

Right? These are rich kids,
lots of expendable income.

Simple economics, you know?

Huh?
You know my weaknesses.

Let's meet this young man of yours,
shall we?

Great.
You won't regret it.

<i>(Muffled music thumping,</i>
<i>people chattering)</i>

<i>(Keys clink)</i>

<i>(Dance music playing)</i>
<i>- Sam: Yo yo, this is crazy.</i>

This party's nuts though.
This is crazy.

See that pink?

You were right, man.

Hey, yo.
Yo!

You Dylan?
Yeah.

Mr. delacorte
wants to see you.

That's that guy
you've been talking about.

I know him!

Okay, big man.

Babe-- Simon?
Yeah, i gotta do something.

I'll be back in a minute,
i promise, okay?

This way, homeboy.
Son of a bitch.

You!

This is
fucking cool, man!

You know, Dylan wanted
me to go with him.

I-- i decided
to stay.

Why?

Gotta make sure you're good.
You know, this is Brooklyn.

Yeah, Brooklyn's dope.
<i>Anything could happen.</i>

I'm just being prepared.
I'm always prepared. See this?

What you gonna do,
cologne them to death?

No, this is pepper spray.
This is some serious stuff.

Don't!
Give me that before you hurt yourself.

Guess I'm gonna have
to protect you now.

Then I'm winning.

D.J.: <i>All right, ladies,</i>
<i>you know what it is, man.</i>

<i>We party here till 6:00</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

<i>Ain't no rules,</i>
<i>ain't nothing to worry about.</i>

<i>â™ª I'm the man 'round here</i>

<i>â™ª if you ask about me,</i>
<i>I'm the man 'round here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm the man</i>
<i>'round here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª if you ask about me,</i>
<i>I'm the man 'round here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª yeah, I'm the man</i>
<i>'round here... â™ª</i>

<i>(Rapping in patois)</i>

Hey, Dylan!
Dylan!

Logan:
<i>Excuse me.</i>

D.J.:
<i>Brooklyn, stand up!</i>

<i>Ladies, take your</i>
<i>panties off, man!</i>

This must be the enterprising young
man I've been informed about.


You only get one chance
to make a first impression.

Now Ernie here tells me that you
wanna be in business with me.

Absolutely.
Absolutely!

<i>(Laughter)</i>

Privilege sure does build confidence,
doesn't it?

Ernie: Mm-hmm.
Why?

What? - Why do you want to be
in business with a man like me?

I mean, you obviously
don't need the money.

But this isn't about
circumstances, is it?

Black, white...
<i>(Phone ringing)</i>

...rich or poor...

Yeah, what's up, primo?
Circumstances are for faggots, aren't they?

Yeah.

Yeah, all right,
thanks.

You see, men are guided
by their desires.

You desire to leave
your circumstances.

Oh yeah.
You desire to turn your back

on the safety net
of vanilla-land over there

and get a little-- a little downtown sprinkled on you.

<i>Maybe have some excitement,</i>
<i>take some risks,</i>

maybe make a little pocket change
you don't have to ask daddy for.

That'd be
a good thing, right?

Hey, boss...

See, Ernie...

Ernie here is different.

(Chuckling)
He has needs.

He needs to feel important.
Yeah, fuck right, he does.

See, Ernie,
Ernie needs

to be more than just
a chauffer.

That's why he's
brought you to me.

And Ernie needs to be
more than just my collector,

and that's why he's introduced me into your world.

That's right.
That's right.

He also needs
to prove to the FBI

that he knows all
about my operations,

and that is why
Ernie's a dead man.

Simon--

Holy fuck, man!
Dude, what the fuck is that?

(Screaming, coughing)

Dylan:
<i>Whoa, man!</i>

(Moans)
Jesus Christ, man! Yo, listen to me!

I-i did not mean to--
(Mocking stammer)

No. See, Dylan--

you didn't think.

You just desired.

<i>- (Blows thudding)</i>
<i>- (Ernie groaning)</i>

Shit, man.
Dude, you can't do this.

No, see, i can

because this is my world

and my desires rule.

I can-- i can pay you.
Look-- what?

Let me pay you, man!
I'm sure you can.


Kill him.

Logan: No, wait! Stop! Run, Dylan, run!
(Gunshots)

<i>(Gunshot)</i>
<i>- Save it, save it, save it.</i>

Save it, save it. Get rid of him.
<i>(Ernie coughs)</i>

Ernie: <i>Please, Simon.</i>
<i>- We got a small problem.</i>

Oh God.

<i>â™ª It's the time</i>

<i>â™ª to get the fever going</i>

<i>â™ª it's the time</i>

<i>â™ª to get the fever going...</i>

Yo, watch yourself!
There they are, there they are.

Let's go-- over there.
Go go!

We gotta go! Let's go! Guys, come on!
We gotta get outta here!

Chloe!
Come on, let's go!

Sam:

Run!
Chloe: Dylan, slow down!

Go go go go go!

Go!
Shit, it's closed.

Jessica: Wait wait wait.
Logan: <i>Over here!</i>

We can get through. Come on.

We can get through.

Chloe: They're coming, hurry.

Chloe: Dylan!

(Sam coughing)

Shit!
All right,

somebody better tell me what
the fuck is going on here!

(Sam coughs)
Oh God. Ernie--

oh shit!
They fuckin' killed Ernie.

<i>What the fuck?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

And they're gonna kill us!
Chloe: <i>Oh my God.</i>

Oh my God, oh my God.
Gotta call the cops.

Shit, i don't have a signal.
Holy shit.

Hannah!

We left Hannah!


Girl: <i>Come on!</i>
<i>- (Knocking)</i>

<i>Girl in the bathroom?</i>

Come on.

Come on!
(Retching)

The girl's been
in there forever.

We left Hannah.

And, Dylan, what the fuck are
you talking about, killing us?

Man, what the hell did you guys do up there, okay?

What the fuck did you do?
Listen, Chloe, it's all right.

It's all right.
We just gotta go get up top and call the cops.

I don't see 'em, guys.
I don't see 'em.

Maybe they're
not coming.

Of course they're coming,
you dumb shit!

Get the fuck off me, man!
They're gangsters.

<i>We saw what they did.</i>

They're coming and they're gonna keep coming

until they kill us all.
Oh, that's my fault, huh?

Logan:
Who's fault is it?

You okay, Sam?
Yeah.

Look, man,
i didn't know, okay?

You didn't know?

<i>Dylan, what were you doing?</i>
<i>- That's enough.</i>

Tell me!
That's enough!

What the fuck did you think you're doing down there?

Look,

while we're here arguing,

what do you figure they're doing?
<i>(Gunshot)</i>

Fuck!
You missed?

Shit!
Fuck you, all right?

You're a fuckin'
pussy, bitch!

<i>(Thugs arguing)</i>

<i>(Kids shouting)</i>

(Screams)
Go go go.

Come on-- Sam, Sam!

(Shouting in Spanish)
What the fuck?

Speak English.
What'd you say?

(Groans) Don't start with me, boss.
You're in America now.

<i>It's your fault.</i>
<i>- All my fault?</i>

We had them and you let them go.
Bro, you had 'em!

If you was good
at some shot--

what's going on?

The kids-- they ran down the platform.
I think they went

behind that blue construction thing back there.

So relax, okay?
They've done us a favor.

Most of the train stations
this part of Brooklyn

are either shut down
or sealed off.

Bones, take chulo,

go out to the club and handle that
shit before the cops get there.

Yo, boss, why i gotta go with him?
He crazy, boss.

Hey, chulo, why don't
you do what you're told?

Come on!

All right.
You got your flashlight on you?

Yeah, boss.

All right.

Let's go hunting.
<i>Whoo!</i>

Whoo!

Jessica: Chloe?

(All shouting)

Logan: Guys, come on,
keep running.

Where the fuck
are we running?

Chloe: Ow!

Jessica: <i>Chloe!</i>
<i>- Shit, come on.</i>

What is this?!
Fucking shit.

Chloe: What?
Dylan: Huh?

What?
There still might be a way out, right?

There has to be.
There has to be.

I don't even know, man.
I don't think anybody's

been down here for years.
You see this?

Maybe we can get out
upstairs.

(Bangs)
No! Fuck.


We just have to get upstairs
and just call the cops.

This can't be happening.
Honey, are you all right?

(Sam coughs)
Are you okay?

Yeah.
<i>(Metal rattling)</i>


Hey, i, uh...

I had a good time tonight.

Me too.
(Chloe mutters)

Somebody give me a hand over here.
<i>(Metal scrapes)</i>

Yeah.

Okay.


It's a phone or something.


There's no way out.
(Grunts)

We gotta go.


Shh.
<i>(Distant shouts)</i>

There they go,
right there.

What-- what is that?

What?
What is that?

I don't know,
but we gotta go now!

Now-- let's go.
Come on.

Shit. Oh.

<i>(Fence rattles)</i>

What-- oh my God.

Whoa.

Those pills...

<i>(Thug speaks)</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

Come on.
<i>(Jessica shouts)</i>

We gotta go on the tracks.
Sam: Shhh!

We gotta go on the tracks.
Man, no!

On the what?
We gotta go on the tracks. Come on!

There's no other way to go.
Are you crazy? Shit.

<i>Come on!</i>
<i>- Sam: Fuck, man! Shh shh shh!</i>

(Whispering) Quiet. Come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

Logan: Come on, Chloe, we gotta go.
I can't go down there.

Sam: We don't got a choice.
You gotta go!

Sam, listen to me-- Sam, Sam.
We don't have a choice!

I can't go down there, okay?
I can't go down there!

Hold on just one second!
(Sobbing)

Okay.
I can't go down there.

I know you're scared, okay?
Chloe, I'm scared too.

But we have to go.

Okay. Okay.

Come on.
Logan: Girls, they're coming.

We have to go now.
Sam: We don't have a choice. Okay, let's go.

We have to go right now. Let's go.
Come on.

Come on, let's go.

(Shouts)
Go go go go!

Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go. Move!

Logan:
Come on, come on, come on.

Let's go,
let's go, come on.

Come on.
Jessica: Come on, Chloe!

(Guy coughs)

(Jessica shrieks)
It's on. Get over here, come on.

Get over here.
What the fuck was that?

It's on. If you touch it, you die.
Just stay away from it.

What?
It's okay, be careful.

Come on, we gotta keep going, you guys.
Let's go, come on!

We gotta go.
We gotta go, come on!

Come on.
(Sizzles)

Stay with me.
Just follow the light.

You guys handle everything at the spot?
Everything cool, <i>jefe.</i>

All right, good.

Let's keep moving.

Smalls.

Ha, this rich kid's
got balls.

I'm gonna enjoy ripping 'em off
and feeding 'em to him.

All right, let's go.


Jessica: Come on, Chloe.
My feet are killing me.

Take your shoes off then.
Oh yeah, right, and walk--

(screams)
(Rats squeaking)


Sam: I got you. Don't worry about it.
I got you. Come on.

Oh my God!
We gotta go. Yo, it's just a rat!


Jessica:
Careful, Chloe.

Chloe: You guy--
Jessica: You okay?

Hey, look up ahead.

Jessica:
What?

Ah shit.

What?

Think it's an exit?

It's worth a shot.

Come on.

Come on.
(Grunts)

Go go go go.
Okay.

(Chloe grunts)
Oh gross.

(All panting)

Everybody stay close.

Ugh, what is
that smell?

Logan: <i>Hey,</i>

that could be
our way out.

Where?
Oh, go.

Chloe:
<i>Please. Oh this is so...</i>

(Chloe sniffles)
Oh.

Oh Jesus.

Looks like
someone lives here.

Chloe: <i>Gross.</i>

<i>(Chloe groans)</i>

What are you doing?

There's a staircase.
It's gotta lead out.

If the exit's locked,
your "friends" could trap us in there.

Hey, what did he mean
"your friends"?

Logan: <i>Cover your eyes.</i>
<i>- Chloe: What? (Shrieks)</i>

Shhh! Keep your voices down.
They could be close.

What?

If they come this way,
just take off.

What?
What about you?

Hey, stay here
with the girls.

Hold it low to the ground.
Give me some light going in.

When I'm out of range,

turn it off!

Oh man.


Shh-shh-shh.

Oh man. Dylan?

Dylan?
Shh.

Chloe:
<i>What does he mean?</i>

Why did he call these
gangsters your friends?

Shut up, Chloe.
Logan said just keep your voice down, okay?

<i>I know.</i>

(Grate screeches)
(Grunts)

What did he mean?
Would you shut up?

Just shut up.
Dylan, i just need to know what he meant.

Stop freaking
asking me questions.

I'm freaking asking you questions
because I'm freaking out.

I don't fucking know, okay?
Just shut up.

Dylan, just tell me. What?
Jesus!

What?

Fuck you!

You know what, Dylan?
You really suck sometimes.

(Neck cracks)
(Sighs)

I'm so glad i never
had sex with you.

Get off me.
I said get off of me!

Stupid bitch.
(Gasps) What?

Oh!

<i>(Chloe sobs)</i>

What?
"Sweets come to the sweet."

Sh-hh--
oh, fuck you.

Ain't no justice.

Let me see the light.

Okay, let's go.

Don't pay attention to him.
He's an asshole.

Yeah.

So...

You never did it
with Dylan?

Nope.

But everybody thinks--

we're, like, going at it
every two seconds. I know.

That's what you're supposed to think, dummy.

Why?

Because there's no such thing
as a cool virgin,

that's why.

You know, Dylan said
i was being stupid,

but i, um...

I just wanted my first time
to be special.


I don't think
it's stupid...

To want your first time
to be special.

Yeah.

Well.

Probably never gonna live
to do it anyways now, so...


<i>(Water flowing)</i>

<i>(Jessica whispers)</i>
<i>Logan!</i>

Where's he at?

You okay?
Yeah.

He's taking
a long time, guys.

I don't even know
what he's doing.

No way back.

<i>(Bottle clatters)</i>
<i>- Shit.</i>

<i>(Chloe gasps)</i>
<i>- Sam: Oh shit.</i>

Dylan: It's okay.
Sam: Shit, go.

Logan!

Hydraulic pressure?

Shh shh shh.

Oh fuck.

Logan!
Shh shh!

Chulo, bones,
you guys take this side.

We're gonna continue
down this path, okay?

Hey! The first whiff
you get of these kids,

you hit me on my walkie,
understand?

Let's go.

<i>(Rats squeaking)</i>

Jess!

Come on, that's it.
We've gotta go.

Let's go, let's go.
Logan!

Oh shit, we're under
the east river.

There's no way out.

<i>(Jessica whispers)</i>
<i>Logan, they're coming!</i>

Logan!
What about your brother?

He'll catch up.
No no, he's your brother.

No, let's go, come on.
Your brother.

He'll catch up.
Come on.

Logan!
Let's go. Now!

Come on, come on,
come on.

Let's move.
Come on.

We should go
this way.

Ugh, it smells
like piss down here.

Anybody home?

Looks like bums been
sleeping back there.

(Rats hiss, chitter)
(Yelps)

Ah!

<i>(Rats squeaking)</i>

(Chulo laughing)
I'm not going if there's rats there.

Let's go.
And it's crazy for me to be scared of some rats?

Hurry up.
Chloe: How can i hurry if i can't see?

Just keep moving.

Chloe: <i>Shit!</i>

Dylan:
Oh shit.

Jessica:
Shh shh!

Ahhh!

Jesus!
(Chulo laughs) Dead end, motherfuckers!

All right, children,
now get your hands up on your pretty little heads.

We're gonna meet
the man.

Get 'em up!
(Gasps)

Let's go.
Get him outta here.

Let's go!

Come on, let's go.
Move!

Come on, let's go.
<i>Muevete!</i>

(Chloe whimpers)
Yeah, i could watch that all night long!

Get off me, you pig!

Ah!
<i>What?</i>

Yo, don't even try
to be a hero.

Turn around.
Move it, move it.

You like the way
that feels?

Huh?

You like that?
No.

You don't like that?
No.

No, please.
Huh?

<i>Please.</i>
<i>- I got something that you might like.</i>

(Whimpers, sobbing)

Please stop.
You wanna feel it?

No.
Go ahead. I'll let you.

Say it, mama.
Go ahead, say it.

"I loved it
when you hit me.

It makes me feel so good
when you hit me."

(Sobbing)
Huh? You like it rough, don't you?

Leave her alone.

What's the matter?
Nothing.

Feeling left out?
No no.

Girls always battling
for attention, huh?

Jessica: <i>I'm not, I'm not.</i>
<i>- Come on, man, get off her.</i>

<i>(Jessica sobs)</i>
<i>- The fuck did you just say?</i>


Oh. Chulo.

This little pussy's
got nerve.

Come on, man.

That your girlfriend?

Come on.
You ain't even got the fuckin' balls

to stand by your woman.

You fuckin' faggot.

That must mean
she's up for grabs. Huh?

Say it. Say it.
Uh...

Say i could have her.

Say it. Shh.

Say it. Go on.

Say it.
I could have her.

(Whimpers) Yo, man--
if you don't say it,

I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out.
Say it!

Bones, bones, bones.

Stop torturing
the punk.

Yeah, we'll have
our fun later.

Let's get them back.

Let's go.
(Chloe whimpers)

Put your hands up on your head!
Let's go!

<i>(Girls whimpering)</i>
<i>- Chloe: Okay.</i>

Bones:
Let's go! Move!

(Walkies chirping)
Yo, d, we got 'em.

Excellent.
We're bringing 'em to the tunnel entrance.

All right, we'll meet you there.
You got all five of 'em, right?

Uh, what?

Run! Run!
(Sam grunts)

(Bones grunts, groans)

Get outta here! Go!
Hurry! Get outta here!

Shit!
Dylan, get them outta here!

Get outta here!
(Girls shrieking)

We gotta go, Sam!
(All shouting)

Dylan:
Come on, Sam! Sammy!

Come on, Sam, we've gotta run.
Look out!

(Gun cocks)

Whoa, come on.

Oh shit.

(Echoing gunshot)
(Moans)


I'm gonna have fun
with you.




Sam...

Sam.


(Chulo moans)





(Yells in Spanish)

Ahh, shit!

Fuck, my eye!


Fucking pieces of shit!

Logan.
(Screams)

Come on.

Come on.

This way.

Logan?

Oh my God,
what happened?

Where's Sam?
Dylan: He can't be far behind.

Come on, let's go.
Jess, come on.

Where's Sam?
Jess, come on, we've gotta go.

Logan, where's Sam?
Jess, we'll find him.

Come on, we've gotta go.

Logan, please tell me
where Sam is.

<i>Jess, come on.</i>

Logan, where the hell
is Sam?

Where the hell is Sam?

Jess, come on.

Oh fuck.

What happened?

Small: <i>This fuckin' dude is barbecue!</i>

Chulo: <i>They-they jumped us.</i>
<i>- What the fuck happened?</i>

They jumped us and Bo--
bones--

and we got one of those
motherfuckers!

What's that, some kind
of fucking trade-off?

Small:
<i>Damn, bones.</i>

<i>What a way to go out.</i>
<i>- (Chuckles)</i>

It's almost funny,
ain't it?

<i>They're still running</i>

because they still think
they're alive.


<i>But they're dead.</i>

Every last one of 'em.

Wait!
<i>(Logan vomits)</i>

Dylan: What's wrong?
<i>(Logan grunts)</i>

Logan.
What's wrong, Logan?

(Sighs)
Jessica: <i>What happened?</i>

What happened back there?
Where's Sam?

He's dead.
What?

They killed him.
Dylan: What?!

No, they didn't.
No, he's-- no, Sam's not--

no, Sam's not dead.

You sure?
Yes.

I'm sure, Dylan.

I watched him die.


I watched the light
go out of his eyes.


What, are you--
you surprised, huh?

(Chloe sobbing)
What did you think would happen?

Who the fuck did you think
you were dealing with?

Dylan, what is
he talking about?

Go on.

Tell her.

Tell her why
your friend died.

Tell her why we're
all gonna die

in this fucking rat-infested
subway tunnel!

Dylan, what is
he talking about?

(Girls sobbing)
Know why you were invited to this party?

Huh?

No.

Jessica:
<i>No.</i>

No.

It was so Dylan could
have a little sit-down

with delacorte and his gang to
peddle their filthy fucking drugs

in your school.
Isn't that right?

Oh, Dylan, no.

No.
You and me, man.

You and me, we were born
with everything.

Everything!

This is the best you can do?
I'm sorry, all right?

I'm sorry Sam's dead.

(Jessica sobs)

Chloe:
Sorry?

You just don't get it.

I didn't mean
for this to happen.

Chloe!
I can't.

I can't.
No, this is way too much, Dylan.

Chloe, listen to me.

Jess.


Get off me.

You selfish asshole.


(Chloe sobbing)

<i>(Rumbling)</i>

Wha--

you feel that?

Yeah, i feel it too.

Logan: <i>It's getting closer.</i>
<i>- Oh no.</i>

(Chloe gasping)
A train.

<i>(Rumbling grows louder)</i>

Chloe: <i>Come on.</i>
<i>- Jessica: We've gotta get out of here.</i>

<i>(Horn blasts)</i>
<i>- Run!</i>

Chloe: Go!
Oh shit!

Come on, let's go!
Hurry!

Chloe:
Go! Go!

Go go go!

<i>(Horn blaring)</i>
<i>- Jessica: Go, Dylan!</i>

(All shouting)

Dylan!
<i>(Horn blares)</i>


...fuck with you.
What the fuck is going on there?

(All pant)

He got anything in his pockets?
He ain't got shit--

yes, he do.
Yes, he do.

Look at this little
pretty thing he got here.

Hey! Hey, man!

(Speaks Spanish) So pretty.
(Dylan coughs)


Man, what the fuck
you looking at, man?

<i>Man, go ahead and give me</i>
<i>some of that money.</i>

You got
a motherfucking watch!

You got the motherfuckin'
cellphone.

<i>Gimme some of that</i>
<i>fucking money, man.</i>

Go ahead, my nigga man.
Hey, walk with that, man. Walk with that, man.

Man, where the hell am i?

I got a motherfuckin'
gold card, baby.

I'm a member now. Ha!
What you know about that?

If you're gonna try to use 'em,
you're just gonna get arrested anyway. Just--

uh!

The credit-- let me have
my wallet, please.

I'll give you these
motherfucking credit cards

if you give me
that sweater.

<i>(Molemen laughing)</i>

What you wanna do, white boy? What you wanna do?
Shit shit.

Take your time if you want.
Lucky we ain't kill his ass.

Get your shit
and get outta here, man.

(Both muttering)

Look like this is shit--
this cashmere shit.

Oh, you ain't gettin'
this watch back!

(Speaks Spanish)

Fuck it.

Somebody got in here
to write on the walls,

so there must be
a way out.

Chloe, where are you going?
<i>I think i found a door!</i>

If the train got him,
we'd have seen him, Logan.

Yeah.

He'll turn up.
You'll see.


It's not like he'd be
worried about me.

That's why he's Dylan
and you're you.

Yeah.

You know, everything's
just come to him so easy.

It-- it's made him
spoiled and arrogant.

You left out selfish
and corrupt.

Yeah.

He's got some good stuff
in him too though.

<i>(Footsteps)</i>
<i>Damn it,</i>

the hallway down there
is blocked off too.

Come on.


Someone please help me
get out of this place.

Hey, man,
how do i get out of here? (Sniffs)

Which way
is the way out?

Hello?

Why the fuck doesn't anyone talk?
Do you speak?

Can someone please tell me
how to get out of this place?

Please!

Will somebody please
help me get out of here?

Come with me.

<i>(Footsteps)</i>

The way out
is that way.

All right, man.
All right, thanks, man.

But if you want
to find your friends,

they're that way.

How do--

hey, how do
you know?

Hey.

Hey.

Hey!
How do you know?

Hey!

Chloe: The hallway down there is blocked off too.

<i>(Chittering)</i>
<i>- (Gasps)</i>

Shh, i hear something.

<i>(Chittering continues)</i>
<i>- Shh.</i>

I hear it too.

Oh shit.

Oh shit, oh no.

I can't do this anymore. I can't do it anymore.
No no no.

I just can't.
Shh. It's okay.

No, it's not.

No, it's not.

It'll be okay.

I can't die here.

Shh.
Come on.

I don't-- i just-- i can't.
Shh, Chloe.

I can't die
in a subway tunnel.

(Hisses)
(Screaming) Get it off me!

What was that?
What-- what's wrong?

I hate those things! I hate those things!
Shh shh.

Oh God!
Quiet, Chloe, be quiet.

Be quiet. Shh shh shh.
I can't.

Quiet quiet quiet.

There's no sign
of 'em.

You think they bought it
in the tunnel?

If a train hit someone
down here, we'd know.

They gotta be
around here somewhere.


(Clicks tongue)

Hey.

You continue
on down this way.

I'm gonna go take a look
back down the tunnel.

No.
Smalls, go with him.

Make sure he doesn't
get his ass killed.

Huh-uh.

<i>You</i> fucked up.

I'll lead.

This is bullshit.

Logan: <i>Come on, shh shh.</i>
<i>- Chloe: I can't, i can't.</i>

Quiet, keep quiet.

They're coming, they're coming.
(Loud sobs)

Oh no! No!
Chloe, shh shh!

No, please.
Shh shh!

(Sobbing)
Shh shh!

Yo, come on, man.

I hope d lets us loose
on these shit stains.

<i>You fucked up.</i>
<i>- (Clicking sound)</i>

What is that noise?

I don't know.
<i>(Squeaking)</i>

Chulo: Wait till i get that one sucker that hit me.

Oh my God, it's done. I'm bringing him in pieces.
(Hissing)

(Muffled scream)
Shh shh.

Oh, and that one mama?
Ha ha, the brunette?

Yeah, definitely gonna
have my way with her.

(Muffled whimpering)
(Hissing)

<i>(Distant bang)</i>
<i>- Small: No, wait wait.</i>

Check out this door.
<i>You heard that?</i>

<i>(Bangs)</i>
<i>- Yeah. Where that come from?</i>

Over here.
Back this way.

Back this way.
Let's go, let's go.

<i>(Squeaking)</i>
<i>- (Chloe whimpers)</i>

(Chloe grunts, whimpers)


Get 'em off.
(Hisses)

<i>(Moleman coughing)</i>

<i>(Water dripping)</i>

Shit.
Oh shit!

(Panting)
Logan: Oh fuck.

(Yelps)
Oh shit!

Jessica:
<i>Be careful, it's wet.</i>

(Chloe and Jessica grunt)

All right.
We're back at the tracks.

They gotta lead us out.
Chloe: Okay.

How we gonna go--
i knew it! We're not getting out of here.

We're never fucking getting out of here!
No no no, don't.

<i>There's fucking sparks flying on the water!</i>
<i>- We'll find a way across!</i>

We cannot cross that water!
Calm down!

<i>Shit!</i>
<i>- It's all right. Chloe, please, look at me.</i>

I'm gonna get you out of here. We'll find a way.
Logan, there--

how?
You gotta calm down.

Jess! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

No sense in pretending
we have any other option, okay?

Shit.
Let's go!

(Chloe whines)
Just be careful. It'll go all the way across.

Come on, Jess.
Oh shit!

(Metal groaning)

<i>(Sparking)</i>
<i>- Shit, hold on!</i>

One, two, three.
Okay. (Whimpers)

No no, i can't! I can't!
No no no no, we don't have a choice.

I have like zero upper-body strength.
It doesn't matter.

Just a little more, come on.

That's good,

(Molemen scattering)

This him?

So apparently you're
the man in charge.

I understand that, uh,

you helped a young man
escape from me.

Is that right?

(Groans)
That smarts, doesn't it?


(Gun cocks)
I'm speaking to you,

you dumpster-diving,
rat-eating fuck!

Now i would like to know
where the kid went.

<i>Don't stop. Just keep moving.</i>
<i>Keep moving.</i>

Jessica: <i>Come on.</i>
<i>- (Creaks, whimpers)</i>

I can't, i can't, i can't.
Come on, Chloe!

I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die! I'm slipping.

(Screams)

Chloe: Am i alive?
(Creaking)

<i>Come on, Logan.</i>
<i>- Chloe: Logan, come on.</i>

(Metal groaning)
<i>Come on. Okay.</i>

(Gunshot)
Logan!

Can't let Simon
have all the fun.

Jessica, run!
<i>Oh my God, Logan!</i>

Man, you fall in that, it's a wrap.
<i>(Girls shriek)</i>

This is how we do it
in b.K., baby.

(Pounding, panting)

(Dylan yells)

(Grunting, yelling)

<i>(Gun cocks)</i>
<i>- Hold it! Let him go.</i>

Fuck you!
He's my brother, man.

You think i won't do it?
Let him go!

Dylan: <i>Shoot him.</i>

(Dylan shouting)

Shit, come on, man.
We gotta get outta here before the others get here.

Let's go.
Come on, come on.

Let's go.

(Dylan sniffs)

I don't see a way out, guys.

It's so dirty.

There it is.

"Exit," that has to be

the most beautiful word
in the English language.



Let's get out of here.

Fucking cold!

Chloe: Oh,
the first thing I'm gonna do is take off these shoes.

Oh God.

Look at this. Let's go,
let's go. Come on.

Okay.
(Chloe laughs)

Well, congratulations,
boys and girls.

You and your little friends here
have led me on a merry chase.

<i>Uh, I'll even</i>
<i>do you one better:</i>

You've ruined my entire
fucking evening.

Look, just leave us
alone, okay?


I feel your pain, babe.
I do.

But, see, i didn't come
knocking on your world.

You came knocking on mine.
(Chulo yells)

Jessica: Logan! Stop it!
(All yelling)

Shit, <i>maricon.</i>
<i>- Dylan: No!</i>

(Girls yelp)
Run!

Get outta here!
You fucking bitch.

Dylan: <i>Go.</i>
<i>- (White grunts)</i>

Ba ba ba ba ba ba.

(Shrieking)

Jessica: Come on, they're coming!
<i>(Chulo yelling)</i>

Go go go! Go!

Oh my God!
(Chloe shrieks)

(Gagging)
(Grunting)

Huh huh?

Welcome to Brooklyn,

Come here,

Jessica: Stop!
Get off of her!

(Chulo screams)

Oh, you girls are really starting to turn me on!

Fucking pretty boy.
You really want to fuck with me?

(White grunts)

(Cocks)
Fuck this hand-to-hand combat shit!

(Screaming)
Oh God.

Stop.

(Dylan grunts)

What the fuck are you gonna do now?
(Dylan choking)

You little

(Dylan grunts)
Huh?

(Shrieking)

Where are you

Get off me!


Fuck yeah--
(Sprays)

Argh-hhh!

(Chulo screams)

You know, there's

about a man's face
before he dies.

You motherf-- ow!
