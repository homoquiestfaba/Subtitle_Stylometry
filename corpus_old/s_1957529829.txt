[suspenseful music]

[train horn blaring in distance]

Good evening, and allow
me to welcome each of you

to the annual Night of the
Locusts.

[suspenseful music]

Please take a moment to
introduce yourselves.

I trust that you have
hydrated and remained

physically and mentally ready.

You will find the target
location

for your run in your respective
packages.

There will be two unwilling
players at the target address,

one male and one female.

[man talking indistinctly]

[Man On Radio] Say something.

Now, there's no
security system in place,

it was deactivated 87 days ago.

Always remember your oath and
the laws

that you've sworn to obey.

Enjoy the evening, fellow
Locusts.

And God bless.

[suspenseful music]

[train horn blaring in distance]

[solemn music]

[insects chirping]

Isn't this a surprise?

How long are you here this time?

Honey, Liz just got into town.

She's gonna stay with us for a
few days.

Obviously.

I did the math.

How was work?

I'm a mortgage bonder, Liz,

Do you really want to know how
work was?

Yeah, I didn't think so.

Jess, a minute.

What the fuck, Jess?

She's had a brutal 48 hours.

How long has she been here?

Did you leave her alone?

No, god dammit, she just got
here.

She just got through telling
me what she's gone through.

How could you let her back in
here?

We agreed on this.

That man laid his hands on
her.

He is so much bigger
and stronger than her.

He could have killed her.

If her story's even true.

She's a liar, Jessica!

Last time she left him, we lent
her money

to get back on her feet,
she fucking robbed us

and ran right back to him.

Just...

Listen

This is different.

She really wants a new
beginning, okay?

We are the only safe place she
has.

How many more second chances?

How many more this times?

Hi, honey.

Sorry, I was...

Daniel, thank you for having me.

I'll only be here a
little while, I promise.

I know you've done a lot for me
already.

We're happy you're here.

I'll be out of your hair soon.

[tense music]

I can't deal with this.

You have no idea.

I have far more important
things to worry about it.

I don't need this shit too.

What could be more
important than family?

Finding a way to pay for all
this.

Honey.

Do better.

Why don't you do something?

All you do is spend my fucking
money.

[tense music]

Oh, there you are.

Here I am.
Come on.

[computer beeping]

Mr. Roebuck.

I was just getting ready to call
you.

I bet.

Been quite a day for you.

How many of those have you had?

This is my first.

Hmm.

I think you're a liar.

I'd say you're about three
in, and you're a vodka man.

Yes sir.

How'd you know?

We're not talking on
the telephone, Daniel.

It's called video chat.

I can see you.

You know, I'm a scotch
man, myself, single malt.

It's not too high brow and
not trash liquor either,

but it gets the job done.

Is there anything bothering you,
Daniel?

Anything you want to get off
your chest?

No.

It's just this thing with
my wife and her sister,

but don't worry, it'll be fine,
it won't distract from work.

Oh, there's nothing more
important

and more infuriating than
family.

Murray.

Was that the name of your
fish in middle school?


Well, anyway, that's what I've
been

calling the mailman, and
his name is probably John.

It's true, it's terrible.

I've missed you!

Oh.

I'm so happy you're here!

Okay, okay.

Missed my Liz.

Hmm.

Wow.

Look at all this.

Look what you did, Jess.

Well, it's not all what
it looks like all the time.

How are things?

I mean...

I don't know, I mean...

It's been an emotional roller
coaster.

Yeah, Daniel.

I don't appreciate you running
out today.

We were all waiting for a full
report

on your interview, and...

You disappeared.

Yes, sir.

Sorry about that.

I needed to clear my head.

Get home, recoup, you know?

That interview was more an
interrogation.

They tore into me.

What exactly did you tell
them?

Nothing.

Nothing, sir, at all.

Any questions they had
about the off-shores,

I said I had no knowledge.

Any questions about the board
meetings off the book, I said-

What meeting, hmm?

Right, right, that's what I
said.

What meetings?

Our board members would
never hold meetings

without some documentation or-

Daniel.

Do I have to remind you
that if this continues,

anything should become of
this pesky investigation,

you're front and center in the
crosshairs.

Yes, I understand, sir.

And do you think that
your wife and her sister

would like this piled on top
of their melodramatic baggage?

I don't think so.

His mood swings, I just,
something big

must be going on at work.

I don't know, he doesn't
talk to me about it.

He just comes home and boozes.

He gets boozy, Liz, it's not
hot.

I promise I won't be here very
long.

I've been looking at some
inpatient-outpatient rehabs,

and this time I'm really
gonna stick to it.

I promise I have some Suboxone,
so I won't get symptoms,

and it's just temporary.

I know.

Look, it's not just Daniel's
house, it's my house too,

and you can stay as long as you
want.

Thank you.


Yeah.

What's he saying?

"Please, I just want to talk.

I'm really sorry.

I love you."

Give me the phone.

Do not respond to that psycho.

I'm not gonna respond.

Don't take my phone away, Mom.

I'm serious, Liz.

Don't engage with that man.

You're safe here now.

I promise you I was a
champ in there today, sir.

They have nothing to
bring any sort of charges.

You'll be proud of me.

Well, that's that's good to
hear, champ.

Oh, I got a note today...

That there's someone
from the tech department

is coming by your house tonight.

Fellow by the name of Isaac from
IT.

Are you two buddies?

Yeah, Isaac.

No, no, no, no.

He's coming by later tonight
to set up the generation

and [indistinct] computer here,
so I can

continue working from
home, log in from here.

I'm pretty slow at kinda setting
stuff up,

so he's doing for me.

Danny, when I called
you a liar earlier...

I believe that.

I just don't know how
good of a liar you are.

[man talking indistinctly]

The hell?

[computer buzzes]

Fuck.

More shit to add to the list.

[speaking foreign language]

[Daniel shouting indistinctly]

Oh god.

That is my cue.

Hey.

I'm really, really glad that
you're here.

Me too.

Don't text that fucker back.

Radio silence.

Radio silence.

[light music]

â™ª You've got that twinkle in
your eyes â™ª

A phone signal?

I was getting a signal
earlier, but it's weird now.

[knocking on door]

Jess.

[knocking on door]

Jess.

â™ª It's a beautiful thing
when you come out â™ª

â™ª Grinning on the other side â™ª

â™ª I hitched a ride with the
devil â™ª

â™ª And I got down on â™ª

[heavy metal music]

â™ª Super new machine â™ª

[Daniel murmuring]

[man singing indistinctly]

[music stops]

[light music]

[man singing indistinctly]

[tense music]

[man coughs]

[suspenseful music]
[man singing indistinctly]

Jess.

â™ª I hitched a ride with the
devil â™ª

â™ª And I got down on his level â™ª

â™ª And he saw his [indistinct]
that he didn't know â™ª

[man singing indistinctly]
[suspenseful music]

Hey, what's up?

â™ª Became you â™ª

â™ª I was lost in thought â™ª

â™ª Swimming in [indistinct] â™ª

â™ª Making up a new definition of
a sinner â™ª

â™ª Getting pretty good
at pretty bad living â™ª

â™ª I was running wild â™ª

[muffled music]

[clock ticking]

[speaking foreign language]

[man singing indistinctly]

[tense music]

Ain't we some sexy mother
fuckers?

[men chuckling]

So what now?


Oh yeah, fuck yeah,
I'll kick that shit in.

No no no, first Troy.

What?

What?

First Troy.

Oh, come on, unmarked.

First Troy.

Unmarked?

Tell us the law.

The law.

All right, well fuck, it just
means

Eisenhower called dibs or
something.

Fuck all that shit.

Unless one of you two overrules
me,

there's a lot of time left on
that clock.

I wanna have some fun.

What do you have in mind?

First Troy granted.

[light music]

[gentle music]

Hold on, my boot's untied.

Go ahead.

[tense music]

[man coughs]

[suspenseful music]

[train signal dinging]
[train horn blaring]

[tense music]

[Daniel murmuring]

[light music]

â™ª To the river â™ª

â™ª The sunshine â™ª

â™ª Leave it all â™ª

[Liz whispering indistinctly]

â™ª Something else â™ª

â™ª To complete me â™ª

â™ª I need your love â™ª

â™ª Sell me your love â™ª

â™ª I want your love â™ª

â™ª I feel your love â™ª

[tense music]

[light music]

â™ª Sell me your love â™ª

â™ª I want your love â™ª

â™ª I want freedom â™ª

â™ª I need your love â™ª

â™ª I need your love â™ª

[Liz crying]

[tense music]

â™ª I want your, I want â™ª

â™ª Please â™ª

â™ª I need your â™ª

â™ª I need, oh â™ª

[country music]

â™ª I know there's trouble when I
go â™ª

â™ª But I'm already on my way â™ª

[woman singing indistinctly]

â™ª But in my heart, I know it's
your way â™ª

â™ª Turn up the radio â™ª

[woman singing indistinctly]

â™ª I know I should just give up â™ª

â™ª But I guess old habits die
hard â™ª

â™ª I wake up in the morning â™ª

â™ª Sun shining down on my face â™ª

â™ª One more, one last night with
you â™ª

â™ª Made for one hell of a day â™ª

â™ª And in a few more hours,
I'll meet you again â™ª

â™ª And you know I won't take it
too far â™ª

â™ª I know you're bad for me â™ª

â™ª But I guess â™ª

[foot thuds]
[Liz gasps]

[tense music]

[clock ticking]

[suspenseful music]

Oh.

Sorry.

Long-time listener, first-time
caller.

Reveal.

It's my third run.

Was fucking memorable.

A place off a remote
island right off the coast.

It's a family of four.

If you could call it a family.

So fucking dysfunctional.

The head of the family?

Guy's been in and out of federal
prison

his whole fuckin' life,
nothing but a con man,

being chased by the feds, by
everybody.

Even hired his own private
security guard.

Thought that was gonna help him.

Not that night.

We took all five of
them, melt 'em all down,

line them up perfectly by the
pool.

And I noticed a machete
right there in the garden.

I picked that fuckin' machete
up,

grabbed him by the back of his
head,

and I took that machete
and I swung it so hard,

and with one fuckin' swoop...
[camera clicks]

[woman screaming]

Reveal.

[light music]

[knife thuds]

[suspenseful music]

[man singing indistinctly]

A lot of went sideways on that
one.

Rained all night.

Was a frat house.
[thunder crashing]

Bunch of drunk, high
fraternity guys, you know?

Should have been easy.

No security, everything went
wrong.

The layout was wrong of the
house.

Right in the middle of it,
six other fraternity guys,

they show up drunk off their
asses.

Got sloppy, we were outnumbered.

And then one of the
brothers had a mini stroke

or something in the middle.

Just wasn't up to it.

We had to disengage.

The only incomplete run I've
ever been on.

Integrity hasn't been the
same since One passed the torch.

Agreed.

And this run.

Nixon.

[tense music]

[Daniel murmuring]

You're booze tastes like shit.

Do you like tickle pain?

Do you have tickle pain?

I saw him shoot shit up his
nose.

This run could go sideways
because of him.

I did a run with Eisenhower
before.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Four years back.
[camera clicks]

this little diner off the main
road.

Three employees, closed at
midnight,

but usually took about an hour-

I didn't ask for a reveal.

Of course.

And here I am pissing on the
laws.

You ever have a duplicate?

Of course not.

That's not supposed to happen.

Well, someone's getting
sloppy at the top.

My eye on Nixon.

Good.

Two runs from the executive
branch.

I salute you.

Thank you, brother.

Protect the run.

Protect the Locusts.

[insects chirping]

All right, I got the
perfect shot, don't worry.

Corner pocket.

[Daniel murmuring]

You won't feel a scratch, don't
worry.

Corner pocket, here it comes.

One, two...

Pacing myself.

I'm pacing myself, don't worry.

He's fine, it's fine.

Jesus Christ, [indistinct].

[man singing indistinctly]

Nothing yet?

We did a run before, you and I.

You?

And me?

No, I don't think so, my man.

It was four runs ago.

You were there.

That's not I, amigo.

Besides, run paths, they
never ever cross again.

Reveal.

What?

You heard me.

Reveal.

[Eisenhower laughing]

Oh, shit.

Look at this motherfucker.

All right.

Sure, pal.

Come on.

Let the interrogation begin.

Come on.

Do your thing.

Oh, no no no.

See, now I know you're fucking
up,

'cause that one right
there, that one I remember.

[tense music]

That's four years ago, and
that was a Christmas party.

Fuckin' serious?

Right now?

Fuck, man.

Fucked, fuckin' jam.

It's like a win-lose with that
fucking...

[tense music]

Please, like nobody's ever
done drugs in your car before.

One star.

[tense music]

[train signal dinging]

A lot of shit changed for me
that night.

See, we terminated 12 targets
that night.

The first two I pushed right off

the top of that motherfucker.

Now don't get me wrong, I like
that shit

because I happened to
pick out the cutest bitch

in the whole bunch, right?

And you should have seen the
look on that bitch's face

when she fell over.

But that's the thing,
it's the look on her face.

I got it for what, one second?

Two seconds at most?

[woman screaming]

[camera clicks]

And then that's it.

Just watch her fall.

And hit the cement from 10
stories up.

And what the fuck is the fun in
that?

[tense music]

[woman singing indistinctly]

See, if I'm gonna kill a bitch,

I want to see it in her eyes.

I want to see a fear.

I want to feel her struggle.

Now, what I learned about
myself is that I like to kill,

and I like to kill 'em close.

I like to hear 'em take their
last breath.

I like to feel 'em struggle.

Right?

I want her to look at me and
wonder

what the fuck is going on.

So many questions in the
last few seconds of her life.

Who is this dude?

What's happening?

Why me?

[insects chirping]

[woman singing indistinctly]

So I remember that night,
but I don't remember you.

So no, Chief.

We didn't have no runs together.

You satisfied?

[bathtub draining]

[tense music]

[gentle music]

â™ª Oh, marigold â™ª

[tense music]

[Jess screams]

â™ª Oh marigold â™ª

[record scratches]
[music stops]

[tense music]

[suspenseful music]

[triumphant music]

Good evening, and allow
me to welcome each of you

to the annual Night of the
Locusts.

I trust that you have
hydrated and remained

physically and mentally ready.

You will find the target
location for your run

in your respective packages.

You may open them now.

Please take a moment to
introduce yourselves.

[Nixon grunting]
[tense music]

Hey.

He's fine.

He's good.

Still breathing.

Why don't you take your turn
upstairs?

Okay.

[tense music]

Fuck.

What's up, guys?

She come out yet?

Truman, you and Eisenhower
go take your turn downstairs.

Whoa whoa, this is just about
go down.

I said the both of you go
take your turn downstairs now.

Let the unmarked stay up
here and take his turn here

You two, downstairs, now.

[tense music]

Time till the nation?

Just under 30 minutes,

Male target's already been
eliminated.

What?

No no, what the fuck?

We still have 30 minutes.

Who called that vote?

It wasn't a vote.

Unmarked did it on his own.

Fuck!

I knew it.

And he had a cell phone.

That's okay.

The jammer will do its job.

That's not the point.

How many more strikes are going
to give-

Dealing with it.

You have the floor.

All brothers assembled,

All in favor of the
compromised being eliminated,

show your marks.

[doorbell ringing rapidly]

[tense music]

door?

Shh!

[tense music]

What's up with your shit
tonight?

Couldn't get the buzzer to work

and my phone doesn't have a...

Oh.

Hello.

What's up, buddy?

Is Daniel here?

I was supposed to meet up with
him.

Sound asleep, already in bed.

Really?
Yeah, like a baby.

I just talked to him a couple
hours ago.

He asked me to come up and
install

some software on his computer.

Awesome.
I'm Isaac, I'm an IT.

I'm his cousin.

Cool.

Family staying in town.

That's always nice.

Actually, we kinda usually
hang out a little afterwards.

His place is a lot nicer than
mine.

Fantastic.

Okay.

Maybe next week.

Next week?
Yeah, have a good one.

Oh.

Oh...

[insects chirping]

[tense music]

Dan.

[Isaac growls]

Fuck that guy.

[tense music]

Come on.

Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

Hello?

Daniel?

Hello?

[suspenseful music]

[tense music]

[Isaac screams]

[light music]

Kennedy, chip holder.

Truman, timekeeper.

Eisenhower, the gammer.

I'm Nixon.

I don't have anything in my box.

Am I'm supposed to have
something in my box?

What, you're an unmarked?

Yeah, I mean, I don't
have any of those marks,

but I should do something,
right?

It's your first run.

You're the student.

Just be ready.

We'll give you duties
throughout the night.

Let's have some fun.

[Nixon laughs]

Can you come out, please?

Can you come out?

I'm tired of fucking
waiting for you to come out.

Come out, just come out, it's
okay.

Come out, please.

Will you fucking come out,
please?

Fucking come on.

Any progress?

No, she's fuckin'...

No, she's still in there.

Who was at the door?

It's only a guest.

It was handled.

Okay.

Could have asked me to help.

So tell me, how did
you find the Locusts?

How did I find the Locusts?

What do you mean?

Am I supposed to answer?

Me, you're asking me these
questions.

Why do I pr...

What?

My name was submitted to the
guild,

by a high-standing member
in excellent standing, okay?

High level?

Now I got the phone call,
all Xs pop up on your phone.

I answered the...

I answered the questions.

Obviously I answered them
correctly, because here I am.

So Truman says he thought he
saw you

with a cell phone earlier.

Why would I have a phone?

No way, man, I know the rules,
come on.

That guy's fuckin' on crack
or something, he's high.

Maybe you should be
asking him some questions,

because I think that clock is
messing with his mind, man.

Come on, man, you're
fucking freaking me out.

Let's just get in here and
get this taken care of.

Why don't you head
downstairs and take another

crack at the pool boy?

I want a turn at this bitch.

Okay.

[suspenseful music]

[Nixon murmuring]

[solemn music]

Five minutes until
elimination.

All right guys, we got what we
came for.

[tense music]

Now at this time,
affirm to your brothers

by raising your right
hand that you are tonight

forever abiding by your oath.

You are not in possession of any
firearms

and you are free from any
communication devices.

That the only time peace will be
held

by the evening's timekeeper.

Always remember your oath and
the laws

that you have sworn to obey.

If those oaths are broken, your
brothers

will protect their own oaths.

[tense music]

[door closes]

Don't come out.

Wait, please.

There's somebody
upstairs, under the bed!

There's somebody upstairs, an
unknown.

I'm serious!

She's gonna ruin everything.

You fucking guys.

The one time I'm fuckin'
telling you the truth!

Don't, please.

[ominous music]

Go on, go!

Upstairs under the bed!

Fuck...

[Nixon murmuring]

[Nixon murmuring]

[Liz shouting]

No!

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

[tense music]

[Jess wheezing]

You got the unknown, right?

She went downstairs.

[tense music]

Now, for your selected level,

there is no security system in
place.

It was deactivated 87 days ago.

The gate security code is
six-five-six-five-seven.

However, you are encouraged
not to use that as an entrance,

the gate could be deactivated by
using

the same code when prompted.

Per your selected level, there
will be two unwilling players

at the target address,
one male and one female.

Timekeeper, start your clock.

You have 180 minutes, no more.

[man singing indistinctly]

[clock ticking]

[clock stops]

Time.

Now, you have been
given your assignments,

and each of you know the pledge
binding you to this evening.

As always, we appreciate your
membership

and your generous
donations over the years.

It gives us great pleasure to
facilitate

this evening for all of you.

Just remember, protect
yourselves, but above all,

protect all Locusts by
first protecting the run,

and you will be protecting
all future runs.

Enjoy the evening, fellow
Locusts.

And God bless.

Woo!

Yeah.

[train signal dinging]

[suspenseful music]

[Nixon murmuring]

Come on, you can't leave me
here!

I'll be fine.

Please.


Come on, please.

Come on.

Come on, please.

No, no, don't leave!

[Nixon murmuring]

Please, no!

[tense music]

Cutting it close, Locusts.

Elimination report.

[solemn music]

[Liz crying]

I'm sorry.

Two targets, one visitor,
eliminated.

And an unknown in the upstairs
closet.

Eliminated?

Clock ran out.

You guys are killing me.

Run intel was bullshit.

A visitor, an unknown-
I got it, I got it.

And your rogue?
Inside.

Law followed.

His first and last run.

Let's hope you guys
didn't come up with seven

in the oh fuck slots.

Between you and me,
there were five unmarkeds

on first runs tonight.

The One's grandson was
on one of those runs.

She's all gassed up and ready to
go.

I know it's chilly, but shed
those

and don't forget the gloves.

I've got clean and pure
clothes here ready for wear.

You guys have a good 365.

I've got work to do.

Extra work, thanks to you guys.

Did you not hear us?

The intel was-
Yeah, yeah.

[tense music]

Fuck.

Bad run.

Hey.

What happened?

Who are you?
Are you okay?

Don't come any closer.

I'm with the gas company.

There's been all kinds of crazy
stuff.

What happened to the-
What are you doing here?

The neighbor smelled gas
and called the gas company,

but what the hell's going on
here?

No no, don't come any closer!

I'm here to help you.

Are you okay?

Stay back, stay back!

Honey, I'm here for
you, I'm here to help you.

[Liz crying]

What happened?

Are you okay?

She's dead.

Who's dead?

Tell me what happened.

[Liz crying]

Tell me about it.

Let me help you.

Tell me, what happened, sweetie?

What happened?

[Liz sobbing]
Shh.

It's okay.

[Liz murmuring]

[fire roaring]

[triumphant music]

â™ª The minstrel boy to the war is
gone â™ª

â™ª In the ranks of death you'll
find him â™ª

â™ª His father's sword he has
girded on â™ª

â™ª And his wild harp slung behind
him â™ª

â™ª "Land of Song" said the
warrior bard â™ª

â™ª "Tho' all the world betrays
thee â™ª

â™ª One sword, at least,
thy rights shall guard â™ª

â™ª One faithful harp shall praise
thee" â™ª

â™ª The minstrel fell but
the foeman's chains â™ª

â™ª Could not bring that proud
soul under â™ª

â™ª The harp he loved never spoke
again â™ª

â™ª For he tore its chords asunder â™ª

â™ª And said, "No chains shall
sully thee â™ª

â™ª Thou soul of love and brav'ry â™ª

â™ª Thy songs were made
for the pure and free â™ª

â™ª They shall never sound in
slavery" â™ª
