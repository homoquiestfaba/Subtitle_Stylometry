Whooo!

 or snowshoe â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª She is ready to explore â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª From Kaktovik
 down to Juneau â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª Always wanting
 to learn more â™ª</i>

Yeah!

<i> â™ª Together
 with her best friend Tooey â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª Always by her side â™ª</i>

 And Trini!

<i> â™ª Discovering the outdoors â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª Molly of Denali â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª She's Molly of Denali â™ª</i>

MOLLY:
"Spring Carnival."

AUNTIE MIDGE:
Walter! Two weeks!

Two weeks
until the Spring Carnival!

Time to get the picnic tables
cleaned up.

Tell Maurice to pitch in.

<i> Mahsi'choo!</i>

MOLLY:
Okay.

Time to unpack!

Sign for the
snowshoe race?

Check!

What about
the frybread contest?

Check!

Oh!

The water balloon contest!

I wonder if we'll finally
win this year.

We'll have to put in
some serious practice.


Big Red!

Ah!

Now I'm ready to MC!

â™ª â™ª

Hello, old friend.

(through megaphone):<i>
 Shalak naii!</i>

Time for the tea-making contest!

Now it feels like spring.

Uh-huh!

â™ª â™ª

Somebody's perfecting
their throwing technique

for the water balloon contest.

Yup!

It's all in the wrist.


Hello.

(Atsaq shouting on phone)

Oh, dear.

Is Auntie Midge okay?


No problem.

I'll get the plane fired up.

What happened?

Atsaq said Auntie Midge
had a fall.

Is she okay?

Yes, but we're gonna take her
to the hospital in Fairbanks

just to be safe.

â™ª â™ª

(engine starts)

â™ª â™ª

The doctor said
Auntie Midge is fine,

but she broke her hip and they
recommend a hip replacement.

She's getting
a brand-new hip?

You can do that?

Yup.

Lots of people have them now.

It's pretty amazing, right?

In a month or so, Auntie Midge
will be good as new.


Hey, Auntie Midge!

How are you?

Pretty good, considering.

I'll be home in ten days--
new hip and all.

So you'll be back
for the Spring Carnival!

Uh... yes...

But I won't be able to come.

No walking on ice
in case I slip.

Doctor's orders.

Don't worry,
Auntie Midge.

We'll handle everything
for Spring Carnival.

<i> Mahsi'choo,</i> Walter!

Molly, can you give your dad
my bullhorn, Big Red?

He's gonna need it.

Sure!

Feel better, Auntie Midge.

(phone chirps)

Poor Auntie.

Isn't there some way
she could come?

I wish.

But I don't think so.

She has to be extra careful
not to slip while she's healing.

â™ª â™ª

Auntie Midge
has never missed

Spring Carnival.


I wish there was a way
for her to be there.


Maybe the hospital...

Aw, man...


You were saying?

Well, I was thinking
the hospital must have some way

of helping people
with a new hip

get around.

You're right!

They must help people with this
problem all the time!

Let's check out
their website.

(keys clacking)

Hey, Tooey!

Listen to what the website says.

You'll have to speak up.

I'm wearing a towel.

(both laughing)

What did you find?

So the website says,

"Patients will need
mobility assistance

using a walker
or a wheelchair."

"Mobility assistance"?

Huh?

What's that?

Hmm...

Sometimes there's a clue
on the page

about what the words mean.

Like this!

A walker.

It's helping her walk.

And a wheelchair
helps you move.

I bet mobility assistance
means helping to move around.

Could we get her
that walker thingy?

Mom said Auntie Midge can't walk
on ice till she's all better.

And there's gonna be a ton
of ice at the carnival.

Too bad she can't just
dog sled around.

Wait a minute!

Maybe she could!

But she'd have to stand
to drive the sled.



What if we build a sled
with a chair on it,

so she can sit?

Listen to this.

"Patients need armrests
on chairs to help them

"sit down safely.

TOOEY:
"Often, patients
need a swivel seat

to help them transfer
to a vehicle."

A dog sled's kind of like
a vehicle.

But what does swivel mean?

Let's watch this.

Seems like swivel
means turn!

I get it.

Like my chair.

Woo-hoo!

I'm swivelin'!

And my head!

â™ª Swivelin' â™ª

â™ª â™ª


We can totally build this
for Auntie Midge.

Ah!

With a little assistance
from Mr. You Know Who!

MR. PATAK:
I'd be honored to help,

but... what is it?

It's a sled chair
for Auntie Midge,

so she can
come to the carnival

without worrying
about falling.

TOOEY:
I added the cup holder.

Hmm...

Well, we can't have a carnival
without Auntie Midge!

Let's get to work!


Yes!

Yes!

(phone chirps)

Guess what, everybody!

We're building Auntie Midge
a one-of-a-kind sled chair,

right, Mr. Patak?

Uh... yes.

(dogs barking)

Hey!

Here comes Tooey
with the dogsled!

TOOEY:
Whoa!

Perfect!

Let's get started!

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

It's done!

<i> Nizii!</i>

It's beautiful!

Not bad!

All set for a test run!

Okay!

Pretend I'm Auntie Midge.

I back up to the chair

and use the armrest
to lower me down.

Now I-- wait for it--

swivel!

Swivel!

Okay, test run.

â™ª â™ª

All right.

And we are... rolling!

Here... I... go!

Hike!

Woo-hoo!

â™ª It's working â™ª

Yes!

Yes!

Gee!

Uh-oh!

Molly!

Eject!



You okay?

Yeah, fine.

But the sled chair's not.

We gotta improve the design
to make it safe.

But the carnival's tomorrow!

We'll never finish in time!

Um...

Tooey?

I know, I know.

Never say never.

â™ª â™ª

(feedback shrieks)

(through megaphone):
One hour, folks.

One hour and the carnival
officially begins!

(plane flying overhead)

Mom's back with Auntie Midge!

â™ª â™ª


Good to be home.

Even if I'm missing
Spring Carnival.

You never know.

Look!

(dogs panting)

TOOEY:
Whoa!

(chair squeaks)

Welcome home, Auntie!

Introducing...

Your very own
sled chair!

Ooh.

Ahh!

My what?

The kids built it
for you!

With a ton of help
from Mr. Patak.

Now you can MC at the carnival,
like always!

It's got a seatbelt
and a swivel lock now.

It's kid-tested,

Mr. Patak-approved.

Want to try it out?

â™ª â™ª

(chair squeaks)

Well, I'll be.

My clipboard!

And the medals
for the races.

And Dad said you're going
to need this back.


Wow.

You kids went all out.

We can't have the carnival
without you.

â™ª â™ª


Well, then, let's not keep
anybody waiting.

Hike!

Woo-hoo!

(all cheering)

Yeah!

â™ª â™ª

Whoa!

(through megaphone):
Is everybody having fun?

(all cheering,
Auntie Midge laughing)

Hike!

â™ª â™ª

(through megaphone):
Go, go, go!

Lift those feet!

â™ª â™ª

Mmm... delicious.

Oscar, your frybread's
almost as good as mine.

â™ª â™ª

(through megaphone):
And it's down to the last
two teams.

What a contest!

â™ª â™ª

(Trini grunts)

(both yelp)

(snowball splashes loudly)

Oh...

(all groaning)


(feedback shrieks)

And we have a winning team!

Vera and Trini!

Congratulations!


(all cheering)

MAN:
Hooray!

Guess we should have spent
more time practicing.

Maybe.

But I think we spent it
on something

even better.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, everyone!

Molly here to answer your
questions about life in Alaska.

Heather from Maine asks,
"What's a land acknowledgment?"

Let's ask my friends
in Anchorage.

ALL:
Hi, Molly!

GIRL:
Today we are having fun
at the museum.


Yay!

GIRL:
Hey, what does that say?

"This is<i> Dena'ina Elnena."</i>

I wonder what that means.

GIRL:
Let's ask when we get inside.

GIRL:
What does that sign outside
mean?

That is a land acknowledgment.

And if you want to learn
more about it,

you can go into the atrium,
okay?

GIRLS:
Thank you.

WOMAN:
You're welcome.

â™ª â™ª


Ooh, I got this far!

I got this far!

GIRL:
Hey, guys, this is where
we're supposed to go.

GIRL:
This is called
a land acknowledgment.

The text here simply reads,
"This is Dena'ina homeland."

The Dena'ina people are
the people native to this land.

GIRL:
We didn't know what the word
"acknowledgment" meant,

so we had to figure it out.

GIRL:
Well, the word has "know" in it.

To know something means
to understand it.

We know
that Alaska Native people

have been living here

for hundreds and thousands
of years,

and still live here today.

So it's really important
to remember that.

And that's what
"land acknowledgment" means.

Everything we can see here
is Dena'ina homeland.

There's 1,000 mountains!

GIRL:
It would be so cool to do
an acknowledgment at our school.

â™ª â™ª

GIRL:
We decided to say a land
acknowledgment to our school,

so everyone can know
about the Dena'ina people.

Today, we are going to read
a land acknowledgment.

<i> "We acknowledge
 that our school</i>

<i> "is built on the homeland
 of Dena'ina...</i>

<i> ...for their care for the land,
 water, plants, and animals."</i>

GIRL:
Good job!


ALL:
Bye, Molly!

<i> Mahsi'choo!</i>

Thanks for asking
and see you next time!

MOLLY:
"Tooey's 'Hole-i-day' Sweater."

(phone chirps)

â™ª â™ª

Ho ho ho!

Welcome to Santa's workshop!

(lights buzzing)

Hmm?


One moment, please.

Hey, everyone!

â™ª Happy holidays â™ª

From way up north
in Alaska.


In case you can't tell,

I get really excited
about this time of year.

I love the lights.

(lights buzzing)

I found the
burned-out bulb!

Yeah!

(phone chirps)

MOLLY:
I love exchanging presents.



(phone chirps)

And all the different kinds
of decorations.

â™ª â™ª

(phone chirps)

â™ª â™ª

(phone chirps)

MOLLY:
But of all
the holiday traditions,

my favorite one is...

(bells jingling)

MOLLY:
Tooey's holiday sweater!

Happy holidays, Molly!

Happy holi...

Wait a second!

Why are you so happy?

I thought you didn't like
wearing that sweater.

I don't, but look!

It's too short!

The sleeves, too!

Yeah!

â™ª The last year
in this sweater â™ª

â™ª The last year â™ª

â™ª In this sweater â™ª


(Tooey singing, Molly laughing)

No, Luka!

The sweater is not
for pups!



I can't believe how long
it's been around.

My Grandma Elizabeth

made this sweater
for my oldest brother, Jay.

And then,
when Jay outgrew it,

my other brother, John,
had to wear it.

Then, when John couldn't fit
in it anymore,

it was my turn.

And the only way to get out
of wearing this sweater

is if you outgrow it.

So...

â™ª The last year
in this sweater â™ª

BOTH:
â™ª The last year
in this sweater â™ª

(Luka panting, kids singing,
bells jingling)

(panting, whines)


Luka, no! Down!

(fabric tears)

Oh, no!

What?

Grandma's sweater!


She'll be so upset!

This sweater's supposed to go
to my little cousin Benji next.


Now the Christmas tradition
is ruined!

(Luka growls)


Maybe Auntie Midge has some yarn
we can use to fix it!

Hey, kids!

(Tooey yelps)

Why do I get the feeling
something's up?

I was dancing and Luka
got excited and jumped up.

And he didn't mean to do it,
but...

Oh, no!

I know!

Grandma's holiday sweater!

She's going to be so upset!

I know.

We were going to see
if Auntie Midge

could fix it for us.

There might be time!

Mom's picking up Grandma
from the airport in Fairbanks.

That's two hours away!

But...

Hmm...

That sweater's made with qiviut.

It's really rare yarn.

I doubt Auntie Midge has some.


I don't want to ruin
Grandma Elizabeth's holiday.

Hmm...


Don't worry.

I have an idea!

â™ª â™ª

Dad, where are you taking us?

I have a friend
who lives nearby.

She owns a musk ox farm.

I thought we needed qiviut,
not musk ox wool.


Qiviut is the yarn
made from musk ox.

Oh!

Oh!

Maybe she'll trade some musk ox
wool for that caribou blanket.

Gee!

â™ª â™ª

GRACE:
Hmm.

A hole in Grandma's
special sweater, huh?

Ha, that's rough.

â™ª â™ª

Well, I'll tell you what.

I've been looking for a present
for my husband,

and I think this blanket
is just the thing.


But...

We don't have any yarn
right now.

Oh.

Oh.

But we do have plenty of wool.

â™ª â™ª

Follow me.

â™ª â™ª


(rumbling in throat)

So that's where
my sweater comes from?

Yes, siree.

â™ª â™ª

The musk ox on your sweater
looks just like him.

And all this time I thought it
was just a picture

of a really hairy cow.

GRACE:
Actually, Tooey,

musk ox are more related
to sheep and goats

than they are to cows.

Ah!

Ah!

Is there anything
we can do to help?

The wool gets caught on shrubs
and on the fence.

Why don't you two
take these bags

and collect some?

On it!

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

TOOEY:
Do you think this is enough?

That should be plenty.

If you need more, come on back.

I made a little kit for you.

You'll need this to spin
the wool into yarn.

Thank you.

Happy holidays.

ALL:
Happy holidays!

(dogs panting)

We're gonna have
this sweater fixed

in no time!

We're never gonna fix
this sweater!

Why?

What's wrong?

This book Grace gave us.

It was in her
yarn-making kit.

<i> "Yearning for Yarn:</i>

<i> A Sweat-Less Guide
 to Sweater Making."</i>

Sounds good so far.

Just wait.

â™ª â™ª

Oh, wow.

This looks really
complicated.


I really wanted to fix this hole
before Mom and Grandma got...

(Elizabeth
laughing)

<i> Apa'urluq.</i>

My grandson.

(both gasp)

I know!

<i> Aling!</i>

Oh, no!

What happened?

Sorry,<i> Apa'urluq.</i>

I was dancing and Luka
got excited and jumped up.

Luka didn't mean to, but
he tore a hole in the sweater!

MOLLY:
But we can fix it.

We got two bags of qiviut!

Yeah!

Only first we have to figure out
how to spin it into yarn.

Oh!

Honey, this is wonderful.

Do you know
how to spin wool into yarn?

Not yet.

But we can learn to do it
together.

Oh, man!

We're gonna be

reading this book
the whole holiday.

Well, we only really need
to read about qiviut.

Let's see if there's an index.

It's usually in the back.

An index?

Yes.

It's an easy way to find

different topics in the book.

It lists things

in alphabetical
order.

Found it!

Look for "Q" for qiviut.

TOOEY:
"N," "O," "P"...

"Q"!

"Qiviut, spinning of,"
page 56.

â™ª â™ª

"Now that your wool
has been washed..."

Oh!

Guess we have to wash it first.

Back to the index!

Back to the index!

"Qiviut, spinning of,
washing of," page 52.

"Fill the sink with cool water.

Add light
dishwashing liquid."

â™ª â™ª

It's dry!

Now what?

"Once your wool is dry,
it's ready for carding."

Oh, look!

There are pictures!

â™ª â™ª

Looks good!

Are we ready to spin?

Yes!

Woo-hoo!

Yay!

â™ª â™ª

(bells jingling)

â™ª â™ª

Here is your first ball of yarn,
Grandma Elizabeth.

<i> Quyana.</i>

Now let's get
this sweater fixed!

MOLLY:
Well?

How does it look?

Now let's see if our
hard work paid off.

(bells jingling)


Honey!

You look so handsome!

I'm glad we were able to fix
your sweater, Grandma Elizabeth,

but... it's ginormous!


You kids brought me
so much wool,

I was able to fix the hole
and make

the sleeves and hem longer,
too!

You'll be wearing it
for years to come!

Oh, yay.

Uh... thanks.

Yay!

My favorite holiday
tradition is saved!

Oh!

Now let's get
a family photo.

â™ª â™ª

Well, there goes my last year
in the sweater.

I know.

But think how happy you're
making Grandma Elizabeth.

And me.

â™ª â™ª

Okay, everybody!

Say, "Musk ox"!

Musk ox!

Musk ox!

(phone camera clicks)

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª
