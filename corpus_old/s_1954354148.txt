IT ALL STARTED WITH A SECRET.

WE ALL HAVE THEM.

EVERYONE'S IS DIFFERENT.

MOST SECRETS DON'T CARRY MUCH
WEIGHT.

BUT SOME...

SOME SECRETS CAN DESTROY
EVERYTHING YOU LOVE.

WHY?

WHY, DAVID?

WHY?!

ARE YOU WATCHING
THE SUNRISE ALONE?

THAT'S NO FUN.

>> NO, I WAS JUST THINKING.

>> ARE YOU GETTING COLD FEET?

>> NO.

NO, I WAS JUST THINKING HOW

LUCKY I AM TO HAVE YOU.

AWW.

FLATTERY WILL GET YOU
EVERYWHERE.

DO YOU WANT TO GO EXPLORE THE

CITY WHILE I FIND JILL?

NO, I'D RATHER EXPLORE YOU.

WE HAVE A TRADITION, REMEMBER?

FOR EVERY NEW STAMP ON THE

PASSPORT, WE NEED TO LEAVE OUR

MARK ON THE COUNTRY.

HOW MANY STAMPS DO YOU HAVE
NOW?

NOT NEARLY ENOUGH.

THAT WAS SO CHEESY.

WHAT? WHAT WAS CHEESY?

"INTERNATIONAL EFFORT"?

WELL, WHAT IS IT?

DAD!

UH..

HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

I PAY YOUR CREDIT-CARD BILLS,
REMEMBER?

I ALWAYS KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

DAVID, WHAT A SURPRISE.

GINA, YOU DIDN'T GET ANY OF

MY VOICEMAIL MESSAGES,

APPARENTLY.

MESSAGES? NO.

LAUREN, THIS IS GINA.

SHE WAS MARCELA'S SISTER.

WELL, I'M STILL HER SISTER.

HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO MEET YOU.

DAVID'S TOLD ME SO MUCH

ABOUT MARCELA.

IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS AN
AMAZING WOMAN.

SHE WAS.

UH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME,

DAD.

YOU THINK WE WANT TO BE HERE?

WE HAVE A WEDDING IN EIGHT DAYS.

YOU'RE NOT MISSING THAT, AND

YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT GONNA MISS

YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR AT --

WELL, I'M NOT GOING HOME.

JILL, I'M NOT MARRYING DAVID

WITHOUT YOU THERE.

SURE YOU'RE NOT.

JILL.

OKAY, WHY DON'T WE RELAX A
LITTLE BIT?

DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX, GINA.

YOU'RE HER AUNT.
YOU KNEW SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

HOME A WEEK AGO.

YOU COULD HAVE PUT HER ON A

PLANE.

OKAY, DON'T BLAME HER.

JUST GRAB YOUR STUFF.

WE'RE FLYING OUT OF BOGOTá
TONIGHT.

NO, WE'RE NOT.

MY PASSPORT'S BACK AT GINA'S IN
MEDICI.

IT'S TRUE.

OF COURSE IT IS.

HOW FAR IS THAT?
UM --

HEY.

THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY GOOD.
WHO IS THIS?

RAMON.

RAYMOND.

MY CAMERAMAN.

AND, UH, MY BOYFRIEND.

THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY GOOD,
EITHER.

I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE ANGRY,

BUT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

SHE'S 18 NOW.

SHE'S TESTING A LITTLE BIT OF
INDEPENDENCE.

JUST GIVE HER SOME SPACE.
THAT'S IT.

I'LL GIVE HER SPACE AFTER
COLLEGE.

SHE'S SUCH A GREAT KID.

CAN KEEP HER CLOSE SO I CAN KEEP

AN EYE ON HER, MAKE SURE SHE'S
SAFE.

THAT'S ALL.

CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.

YOU WENT BACKPACKING THROUGH

EUROPE WHEN YOU WERE IN COLLEGE,
RIGHT?

THAT'S WHEN YOU MET MARCELA,

HMM?

WAS THAT SAFE?

>> WHY WOULD SHE SUDDENLY WANT

TO SKIP THE WEDDING?

HAS SHE SAID ANYTHING TO YOU?

YEAH.

AND?
AND WHAT?

WHAT DID SHE SAY?

LET'S HEAR IT.

OKAY.
YOU'RE ON HER FACEBOOK AS "A

GOLD-DIGGING BITCH MARRYING MY
DAD."

WHY THE HELL WOULD SHE SAY
THAT?
I MEAN --

NO, NO, NO, NO. SHUSH.

I COMPLETELY GET IT.

I'M NOT TRYING TO REPLACE

MARCELA, AND I NEVER WILL.

WHY IS HE STILL WITH US?

RELAX A LITTLE BIT, PLEASE.
I TOLD YOU.

HE'S MY CAMERAMAN.

HE'S A GOOD GUY.

HE'S JUST HER SUMMER BOYFRIEND.

WHAT'S ALL THE FUZZ ABOUT?

OF COURSE, THAT'S WHAT MY SISTER
SAID ABOUT YOU AT FIRST.

THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT.

I DON'T WANT HER HAVING BABIES

AT 18 LIKE US.

COME ON.

SHE WON'T, BELIEVE ME.

OKAY, REMEMBER THAT TRIP TO

VEGAS?

YOU AND MARCELA WERE TAKING
SHROOMS.

YOU USED TO DO THAT, RIGHT?

NO.
YEAH, RIGHT.

SHH.

NO, I WASN'T.

I BET YOU DO. 

AND MY SISTER WENT ALL CRAZY

ABOUT THE PARK BUSES.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT JILL NEEDS

TO KEEP HER SPIRIT ALIVE.

SHE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HER.

SHE SAYS YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT

HER ANYMORE.

IT'S IMPORTANT FOR HER.

GINA, ARE YOU SURE THIS ROAD
IS SAFE?

ISN'T FARC AROUND HERE?

FARC? NO, NO.

NO, WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF MOST OF
THEM?

"MOST"?

SORRY, SORRY.

WELCOME TO COLOMBIA.

GINA, WHY DON'T YOU LET, UM,

DAVID DRIVE FOR A BIT SO YOU CAN

HAVE A REST?

DO YOU WANT ME TO?

I DON'T MIND.

OKAY.

FANCY WEDDING, HUH?

SOUNDS LIKE BUSINESS IS GOING
WELL.

I'M GLAD.

>> BETTER TO BE THE AGENCY OWNER

THAN ANOTHER PHOTO JOURNALIST

SLUGGING IT THROUGH WAR ZONES.

HAVE YOU SEEN HIS PICTURES?

YEAH.

YOUR BOOK WAS FANTASTIC.

I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THE BEST

I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, I
SWEAR.

YOUR SISTER USED TO TELL ME I

SPENT TOO MUCH TIME DOCUMENTING

LIFE AND NOT ENOUGH TIME LIVING
IT, SO I'M WORKING ON THAT.

GOOD.

I LIKE YOUR BRACELET.

REALLY? HMM.

HERE. YOU CAN HAVE IT.

DON'T BE SILLY.

IT'S A GIFT.

AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING

TO REMEMBER FROM MY COUNTRY.

THANK YOU.

THERE YOU GO.

IS IT OKAY IF I SMOKE?

OH! 

NO, NO, NO, NO.

NO ONE'S SMOKING, OKAY? SORRY.

AND, JILL, PLEASE SPEAK ENGLISH

SO LAUREN AND I CAN JOIN IN THE
CONVERSATION.

OH, SHIT.

CAN YOU GRAB MY PASSPORT OUT OF
MY BAG?

YEAH.

BUENAS.

BUENAS.

BUENAS.

CONNECTICUT.

CONNECTICUT.

HE ASKED WHERE WE'RE GOING,

NOT WHERE WE'RE FROM.

WHAT'D HE SAY?

FLASH FLOODS.

HE WANTS US TO TURN AROUND.

OKAY. OKAY.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

HE'S WRONG. HE'S WRONG.

HE'S A LOCAL.

I KNOW THIS.

I KNOW THIS ROAD PERFECTLY.

WE SHOULD FIND THE MAIN ROAD

LIKE IN ABOUT 10, 12 MILES.

YOU SURE?

YEAH. YEAH.

I'M SURE. LET'S GO.

WHY WOULD YOU LET JILL GO

ANYWHERE WITHOUT HER PASSPORT?

NOW WE MIGHT NOT MAKE OUR
FLIGHT.

WHERE'S THE MAIN ROAD?

IT SHOULD BE COMING UP.

YOU SAID THAT HALF AN HOUR
AGO.

IS THERE A MAP IN THE

GLOVE BOX?

DAVID! DAVID, WATCH!

D-DAVID!

JESUS!
IT'S OKAY.

EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

SHIT. COME ON.

WE'RE GONNA HAVE

A HOUSE.

COME ON!

OKAY, OKAY, EVERYBODY JUST STAY

CALM, ALL RIGHT?

WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

FELIPE.

ASK HIM IF HE HAS A

CELLPHONE.

HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

OH, I'M GREAT.

IT'S BEEN A GREAT HOLIDAY SO
FAR.

I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED, BUT I'M

JUST GONNA DO A SELF-EXAM AND

I'LL LET YOU KNOW, OKAY?

YOU'VE GOT A CUT ON YOUR EYE.

I'LL BE OKAY.

THERE GOES OUR WEDDING PICTURES,
RIGHT?

OW. GEEZ.

COULD I GET A-A GLASS OF WATER?

UH...

GRACIAS.

GUY'S CREEPY.

HE JUST TOLD ME MY MOM'S ROSARY

WON'T PROTECT ME.

THANKS.

THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.

UM, DO YOU HAVE ANY WOOD FOR

THE FIREPLACE?

I CAN GET IT FOR YOU.

HE DOESN'T WANT US TO GO.

YOU GO. I'LL STAY WITH LAUREN.

GALLOWS HILL.

WHAT?

THIS WAS A HOTEL.

THIS WAS A HOTEL?

IT'S PROBABLY JUST AN OLD

PHONE.

IT'S PROBABLY JUST AN OLD
PHONE.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

WAIT. I REALLY THINK WE
SHOULD STICK TOGETHER.

DON'T LEAVE.
LAUREN.

PLEASE.

I'VE BEEN HOLDING IT SINCE
THE CAR, OKAY?
I HAVE TO GO.

I'LL STAY WITH YOU, LAUREN.

OKAY, HURRY BACK, PLEASE.

WOULD YOU MIND IF I HAVE A

LOOK?

YEAH.

OH, SHIT.

YOU SHOULD GET SOME X-RAYS RIGHT
NOW.

THEY'RE ONLY GONNA TELL ME
THAT I'VE GOT TWO BROKEN RIBS.

ARE YOU SURE?

'CAUSE IT LOOKS BAD.

I'M A NURSE, GINA.
I KNOW WHAT BROKEN
RIBS FEEL LIKE.

OKAY.

WE SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO
THE CAPTAIN.

THIS IS...

SO, YOU GET A GOOD LOOK?

OKAY.

COME ON.

I SAW YOU LOOKING AT MY AUNT'S

TITS.

SO NOW YOU WANT TO SPEAK

ENGLISH.

OKAY.

OUR CAR IS WRECKED.

LAUREN IS INJURED.

AND WE'RE TRAPPED IN A HOUSE...

WITH A PSYCHO KILLER.

AND YOU'RE WORRIED THAT I WAS

ADMIRING GINA'S TITS?

YOU LOVE ME.

SHUT UP, YOU MORON.

HEY, I WAS THINKING.

MAYBE MAKE SENSE FOR YOU TO GO

HOME NOW.

VERY NICE.

WIN THIS ONE.

BE QUIET.

THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL THERE.

COME!

LISTEN.

WE NEED TO FIND HER.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?

WHERE'S JILL?

SHE WENT LOOKING FOR A
BATHROOM.

JILL.

I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

HERE. HERE.

SHH.

WE HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE.

HELP ME.

RAMON, COME ON.

WHAT IS THIS?

A BATHROOM?

WHAT THE HELL?

IS HE LIVING HERE?

I DON'T LIKE THIS, JILL.

OH, MY GOD.

ANA MARIA.

FELIPE?

>> Sí.

>> AAH!

WHAT ARE YOU TALK--

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

YOU CRAZY FUCK!

SHE'S JUST A LITTLE GIRL!

AAH!

WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING DOWN
HERE? WHY'D HE HAVE A
GUN ON YOU?

DAD, HE'S GOT A LITTLE GIRL
IN THERE.

WE HAVE TO GET HER OUT.

WHAT?

LOOK.

POINT THIS AT THE LOCK.

OKAY.

JESUS.

OH, MY GOD.

PUT HER DOWN.

WHO IS SHE?
HER NAME'S ANA MARIA.

FELIPE HAD HER LOCKED IN THE
BASEMENT.

WHAT?!
WHAT?!

OH, MY GOD.

WHAT HAPPENED?

HE HAD A GUN POINTED AT JILL.

WE SHOULD TIE HIM UP IN THE
OTHER ROOM.

GIVE ME A HAND.

THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

GINA.

I'M GONNA CHECK THE BOX,
OKAY?

LOOK, GINA, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE IS DOWN THERE.

WE SHOULD STICK TOGETHER.

I'LL BE FINE.

CHECK TO SEE IF HE HAS A CAR.

AUTOMOBILE. ENTIENDES?

A CAR.

JILL, DON'T GO FAR.

I MAY NEED YOU.

I WANT TO ASK HIM SOME QUESTIONS

WHEN HE WAKES UP.

I'M SO SORRY THAT THIS HAS

HAPPENED TO YOU.

BUT WE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU AND

GET YOU HELP.

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.

WHERE IS YOUR MAMA?

FELIPE.

DON'T WORRY.

I WON'T LET HIM NEAR YOU.

WE CAN'T LEAVE YET, BUT WE'LL

FIND A WAY OUT OF HERE.

YOU HUNGRY?

OKAY. GINA!

JILL?

STAY THERE.

GINA?

JILL!

ANA MARIA.

I TOLD YOU I DON'T SPEAK
SPANISH. JILL!

I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH!

WHAT'D YOU DO TO THE LITTLE
GIRL?

JILL!

JILL, I NEED YOU NOW!

WHAT'S HE SAYING?

HE SAID WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.

ANA MARIA?

ANA MARIA?

ANA MARIA!

OPEN THE DOOR.

ANA MARIA, I NEED YOU TO OPEN

THE DOOR.

ANA MARIA!

ADIOS, PAPA.

VAMOS.

VAMOS!

ANA MARIA!

HAS ANYONE SEEN ANA MARIA?

>> I THOUGHT SHE WAS WITH YOU.

YOU OKAY?

RAMON IS GETTING FELIPE'S CAR.

WE'RE GETTING THE HELL OUT OF

HERE.

WHY'D YOU TAKE HER OUTSIDE?

SHE WAS THERE ALONE.

I DON'T KNOW WHY.

GINA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE

HELL HAPPENED DOWN THERE.

WHAT MATTERS IS THAT WE GET

LAUREN AND ANA MARIA TO THE
DOCTOR, OKAY?

PUT THAT AWAY.

THE OLD MAN'S CAR IS DESTROYED.

CAN IT BE FIXED?

>> FELIPE HAS TO HAVE SOME KIND

OF TRANSPORTATION.

I MEAN, HE CAN'T SURVIVE IN THE

MIDDLE OF NOWHERE WITHOUT ONE.

I'LL GET HIM TALKING.

DID YOU HEAR THAT?

YEAH.

WHAT WAS THAT?

I-I-I...

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.

DAVID, LOOK AT THIS WRIST.

HE SLASHED HIS WRIST BEFORE

HE ATTACKED US.

DAD?

DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON?

HEY.

EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

LOOK, WE NEED TO GET

ANA MARIA TO A DOCTOR.

I HAVE NO IDEA HOW BAD THOSE

INJURIES MIGHT BE, AND...

SO WHEN -- WHEN THE STORM LETS

UP, LEAVE US HERE AND YOU AND

RAMON NEED TO HIKE INTO TOWN.

WHAT ABOUT YOU?

I'LL BE FINE.

LOOK, IF MY DAD HAS TO PUSH ME

IN A WHEELCHAIR DOWN THE AISLE,

WE ARE STILL GETTING MARRIED.

UH...

OKAY.

ALL RIGHT.

DAD.

YEAH?

I NEED YOU.

DAD, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

WITH THIS PLACE.

WHY ARE ALL THE PHONE LINES CUT?

WHAT WAS HE TRYING TO HIDE?

WHAT'S HE TRYING TO HIDE?

THAT HE'S A PEDOPHILE, JILL.

I DON'T THINK THAT'S IT.

LOOK, THAT BOX LOOKED LIKE IT

HADN'T BEEN OPENED IN A LONG,
LONG TIME.

HOW'D SHE STAY ALIVE IN THERE?

WELL, I GUESS HE SHOVED FOOD

UNDER IT.

WHERE?

IT WAS SEALED SHUT.

OKAY.

LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT

BOX.

GINA.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I NEED HER SIDE OF THE STORY.

OKAY, THIS IS AMAZING, LAUREN.

THIS IS CRAZY.

THIS MIGHT BE ALSO HEALING FOR

HER, YOU KNOW?

SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK, SO
STOP FILMING HER.

AND DON'T BULLSHIT ME THAT THIS

MIGHT BE THERAPEUTIC.

I'M GONNA BRING YOU SOME MORE

ICE, OKAY?

THANK YOU.

SURE.

AAH!

AAAH!

SEEN THIS SYMBOL.

IT'S IN FELIPE'S JOURNAL.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

I DON'T KNOW.

IT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF

LANGUAGE.

ANA MARIA COULDN'T HAVE

WRITTEN THAT.

IT'S TOO HIGH.

THAT POOR GIRL.

LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

WHO IS THAT?

WHOEVER IT IS, THEY'VE BEEN

DEAD FOR A LONG TIME.

SOME WRITING ON IT.

IT'S IN SPANISH.

HERE.

THAT WAS HIS WIFE.

IT SAYS SHE WAS THE LOVE OF HIS

LIFE.

THEN WHY DID HE KILL HER?

WE THINK HE'S LIVING DOWN HERE.

LOOK AT THIS.

IS THAT ANA MARIA?

LOOKS LIKE HER.

1978.

DAD, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

SHE'D BE ALMOST 40 YEARS OLD
NOW.

WE NEED TO TALK TO ANA MARIA.

DAVID!

JESUS.

WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
GINA.

HUH?! IS SHE OKAY?!

I JUST FOUND THEM LIKE THIS.

GINA WAS ON THE FLOOR, AND

ANA MARIA WAS DEAD.

ANA MARIA, LISTEN TO ME.
ANA MARIA.

>> SOMEBODY SLASHED HER THROAT.

WHAT -- WHAT HAPPENED?

GINA.

>> COME ON. WAKE UP.

HUH? WHAT HAPPENED?!

WHO DID THIS?!

SOMEONE'S HERE IN THE HOUSE.

YOU SAW SOMEONE?

NO, BUT I FELT, LIKE, AN

ELECTRIC SHOCK, LIKE A TASER,

AND -- AND I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE.

THEN YOU GUYS FOUND ME.
THAT'S ALL.

ALL RIGHT.
FROM NOW ON, WE STAY TOGETHER.

STORM WILL LET UP IN THE
MORNING.

WE'LL LEAVE THEN.

NO. WE NEED TO GET OUT
OF HERE RIGHT NOW.

WE STAY HERE, AND WE STAY
TOGETHER.

I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE
RIGHT NOW.

FOR ALL WE KNOW, FELIPE COULD BE

HIDING AN ACCOMPLICE SOMEWHERE.

GINA'S RIGHT, DAVID.
LOOK, IF THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
HERE --

NO, IT'S BETTER TO STAY IN
THE HOUSE THAN WANDER AROUND IN

THE STORM OUTSIDE.

IT'S GONNA GET DARK SOON.

GUYS, I DON'T KNOW.

ALL I KNOW IS THAT LITTLE GIRL

SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME, OKAY?

I'M GLAD SHE'S DEAD.

HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
SHE WAS JUST AN ABUSED LITTLE
GIRL.

YOU THINK SO?

FELIPE DIDN'T SEEM ANGRY WHEN WE

LET HER OUT OF THE BOX.

HE SEEMED TERRIFIED.

AND THEN HE TOLD ME THAT MY

ROSARY WOULDN'T PROTECT ME?

PROTECT ME FROM WHAT?

AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE ANCIENT

MARKINGS INSIDE THE BOX, HUH?

WHAT DID THEY MEAN?

THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

DAD.

DAD, COME ON.

YOU SAW THAT PHOTO.

DOESN'T TAKE A BOX LIKE THAT TO

LOCK UP AN ORDINARY LITTLE GIRL.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

WHAT PHOTO?

WHAT IS THIS?

LOOK AT THE DATE.

THAT CAN'T BE HER.
LOOKS JUST LIKE HER.

THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

YOU'VE ALL LOST YOUR MINDS.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE, BUT ALL THIS SHIT STARTED

HAPPENING WHEN WE LET ANA MARIA

OUT OF THE BOX.

ALL I CARE ABOUT NOW IS GETTING

THE FIVE OF US OUT OF HERE

SAFELY, SO WE LEAVE IN THE

MORNING.

HERE.

KEEP AN EYE ON THEM.

MAKE SURE NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS.

I'M GONNA GO TAKE CARE OF

ANA MARIA'S BODY.

WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

YOU OKAY?

YEAH.

YEAH, I'M OKAY.

OKAY, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

I WON'T STAY HERE DOING NOTHING.

GIVE ME YOUR CELLPHONE.

THERE'S NO SIGNAL.
I'LL FIND IT.

HEY. WHERE YOU GOING?

I'M GETTING US OUT OF HERE.
NO, WAIT. GINA. GINA!

YOU GO WITH HER.

HEY.

YOU STAY WITH ME IN CASE THERE'S

SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE, OKAY?

WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

DAD.
DAD, I SAW SOMEONE OUTSIDE.

STAY HERE.

THANK GOD IT'S YOU.
YOU PULLED US OVER ON THE ROAD,

REMEMBER?


WHAT?


OKAY, LISTEN, WE GOT INTO AN

ACCIDENT IN OUR CAR.

OUR CAR.

WE HAD TO WALK HERE. WHAT?

FELIPE IS, UH...

VAMOS!

MY DAUGHTER!

SHE SPEAKS SPANISH!

VAMOS!
>> SHE CAN EXPLAIN, OKAY?

>> GO!
>> OKAY, WAIT, WAIT.

FELIPE!

JILL!

OH, MY GOD.

COME HERE, COME HERE.

JUST EXPLAIN TO HIM WHAT

HAPPENED, OKAY?

HE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE FELIPE
IS.

OKAY! WAIT!

I'LL SHOW YOU.

VAMOS. VAMOS!

GO!

RáPIDO!

HE HAD A LITTLE GIRL IN A
BOX.

HE TRIED TO ATTACK US.

JUST TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED!

WHY YOU LET HER OUT?!

AAH!
THAT WASN'T US!

TO THE BASEMENT RIGHT NOW!

RIGHT NOW! GO! I SHOOT!

GO!

VAMOS!

RáPIDO!

OPEN THE DOOR!

OKAY, GET IN. GET IN.

GET IN, I SAY!

DON'T TOUCH HER!

STOP RIGHT THERE.

LET'S GO.

DO WHAT HE SAYS.

VAMOS.

JESUS.

QUICKLY.

OKAY.

GO!

WHERE IS THE OTHER WOMAN?
GINA?

SHE LOOKED FOR HELP!

GO IN.
NO.
GO IN.

NO. DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

LISTEN TO ME.

YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO US.

WHY ARE YOU SO SCARED?

IT'S JUST US.

GO. GO IN! GO IN!

GO IN!
DAVID!
DAD!

AAH!

LET HIM GO.

IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WITH

YOU?

ANSWER HER.

AFTER YOU GO IN THE BOX, I

WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU
HAVE.

LIKE HELL WE'RE GOING IN
THERE.

JILL, TAKE LAUREN UPSTAIRS.

FIND GINA AND RAMON.

WE'RE TAKING HIS TRUCK AND

GETTING OUT OF HERE.

COME ON. LET'S GO.
GET IN THE BOX.

COME ON. NOW. IN THE BOX.

GET IN.

LISTEN, YOU WENT IN THE BOX.

I TRUST YOU.

YOUR FAMILY IS IN DANGER.

WHY?

SHE'S OUT.

WHO?

FELIPE'S DAUGHTER?

SHE'S DEAD.

SHE IS NOT DEAD.

SHE'S NOT EVEN A LITTLE GIRL.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

WHO WAS WITH ANA MARIA WHEN

SHE DIED?

GINA AND LAUREN.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

WHAT DOES THAT MATTER?

BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS NOT

YOUR FAMILY ANYMORE.

HOW IS THAT SIMPLE?

WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

PLEASE.

LET ME SHOW YOU.

DAD, I CAN'T FIND THEM
ANYWHERE.

WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

THE HAND.

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S THE OTHER WOMAN.

MMM.

DAVID, YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME

IF YOU WANT YOUR FAMILY TO
SURVIVE.

GINA.

GINA.

HER NAME WAS ELENA.

SHE WAS A BRUJA.

A WHAT?

A WITCH.

THE SPANISH PRIESTS, THEY HUNG

HER HERE IN GALLOWS HILL IN THE

17th CENTURY.

30 YEARS AGO, FELIPE FOUND AN

OLD MAN SEALED AWAY WITH THOSE

ANCIENT SYMBOLS.

HE LET HIM OUT.

YOU SAID ELENA WAS THE WITCH.

SHE CANNOT BE KILLED.

IF YOU KILL HER, SHE WILL GO

INSIDE OF YOU.

WHEN SHE WENT INTO HIS DAUGHTER,

FELIPE BUILT THAT BOX TO HOLD
HER.

FELIPE WROTE DOWN EVERYTHING HE

FOUND OUT IN THAT DIARY.

WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT LISTEN

TO HER.

SHE KNOWS ALL YOUR SECRETS.

SHE WILL USE THEM AGAINST YOU.

WE ARE TOO LATE.

THE BOY MUST HAVE SHOT HER.

SHE'S INSIDE HIM NOW.

YOU SAYING RAMON KILLED GINA?

KEEP HIM AWAY FROM YOUR
FAMILY.

SHE'LL DO ANYTHING TO LEAVE.

OH, MY GOD.

THESE ALL HAPPENED RIGHT
BEFORE THE INN CLOSED DOWN IN
'78.

WHAT DOES -- WHAT DOES THIS

MEAN?

AUTO-DA-Fé.

IT SAYS HERE IT'S THE BURNING

OF THE HERETIC.

THE SPANISH INQUISITION KILLED

THOUSANDS OF INNOCENTS THAT WAY.

APPARENTLY THIS ONE WASN'T SO

INNOCENT.

>> AAH!

AAAAH!

A WITCH? REALLY, DAVID?

LOOK AT ALL THIS RESEARCH

FELIPE HAS DONE.

WHAT ARE ALL THOSE NAMES?

THESE ARE THE SAME NAMES THAT

ARE ON THE NEWSPAPERS.

LOOK.

HERNANDEZ, PEREZ...

MORALES.

MORALES?

LIKE CAPTAIN MORALES.

THESE ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF

THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR

THE HANGING OF ELENA.

THE WITCH.

OPEN THE DOOR!

RAMON IS COMING! HE'S WOUNDED!

WHO ARE YOU?

WHY IS YOUR NAME IN FELIPE'S

JOURNAL?!

MY ANCESTOR!

HE WAS PRIEST THE HANGING OF THE
BRUJA!

PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR!

SHE KILLED MY FATHER, DAVID!

COME ON! PLEASE!

JILL, GO TO THE KITCHEN AND
GET ME SOME WET RAGS.

YEAH.

>> WHERE'S RAMON?

I SHOT HIM IN THE LEG TO SLOW
HIM DOWN.

HOW DO WE MAKE THIS STOP?

SHE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL SHE
KILLS EVERY DESCENDANT.

SHE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.

YOU'RE JUST IN THE WAY.

YOU STILL HAVE MY CAR KEYS?

YOU TAKE YOUR FAMILY AWAY FROM
HERE.

SHE DOES NOT WANT YOU. ONLY ME.
I AM SORRY.

THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

I LET HER OUT OF THE BOX.

NO, NO.

I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WITCH.

YOU SAVE YOUR FAMILY.

JILL!

JILL, IT'S ME! OPEN UP!

GINA?

OH, MY GOD.

GINA, YOU'RE ALIVE?

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

WHAT HAPPENED?

>> OPEN THE DOOR.

I WAS HIDING.

RAMON TRIED TO KILL ME!

 OPEN UP!

GINA?

AAH!

AAH!

NO!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I HAD HIM.

SAVING YOUR LIFE.

YOU CAN'T KILL HIM.

COME ON!

REMEMBER, YOU SEE RAMON, IT'S

NOT RAMON.

IT'S THE BRUJA.

YOU DO NOT KILL HER.

YOU WOUND HER.

YOU SLOW HER DOWN.

YOU MUSTN'T KILL HER, FOR YOUR

SAKE.

IF YOU KILL HIM, YOU DIE.

COME ON.

GINA'S DEAD.

FUCK!

BITCH!

FUCK YOU!

JILL, COME ON.

DAVID, NO!

 DAVID!

IT'S ME, RAMON!

DAVID, IT'S ME!

YOU GO GET MORALES.

I'LL KEEP RAMON HERE.

HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

I JUST HANDCUFFED HIM TO THE
TRUCK.

YOU GOT HIM. OH, MY --

NO.

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

NO!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

COME ON,
DAVID!

COME ON!

DAVID, SEE YOU SOON.

WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID TO

MARCELA.

GIVE ME THE KEYS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

GIVE ME THE HANDCUFF KEYS.

GIVE ME THE KEYS!

PLEASE!

DAVID!

WAIT.

>> DAVID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

HE'LL TRY TO KILL US AGAIN.

COME ON. COME ON.
BREATHE!

WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SAVE
HIM?

THE WITCH!

IF WE KILL HER, SHE SOMEHOW

TAKES OVER YOUR BODY!

WHAT?

DAD!

LAUREN!

STAY WITH ME, BABY!

STAY WITH ME! LOOK!

YOU HAVE TO FIGHT IT! COME ON!

YOU'RE STILL IN THERE.
YOU CAN FIGHT IT.

STAY WITH ME.

LOOK AT ME!

LAUREN!

COME ON! DON'T LEAVE ME!

THE ROPE! HIS ROPE!

GO GET SOME ROPE! QUICK!

AAH!

HURRY!

PLEASE. PLEASE.

HERE.

GET HER FEET.

 IT'S ALL YOUR
FAULT, DAVID.

GOD IS PUNISHING YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY FOR WHAT YOU DID.

OH, MY GOD.

YOU KILLED HER, DAVID.

DAD.

SHUT UP!

OH, HE TURNED OFF MOMMY'S

MACHINE BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T DIE

FAST ENOUGH.

DAD, WHAT IS SHE TALKING
ABOUT?

SHUT UP!

DAD, DID YOU DO THAT?

HELP ME, JILL. PLEASE.

IS THAT TRUE?

I HATE YOU!

JILL!

WHAT?!

WE NEED TO GET HER BACK TO
THE HOUSE.

IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE
HER.

PLEASE. PLEASE.

JILL!

I NEED YOUR HELP.

>> EL CAPITAN.

DID YOU MISS ME?

ELENA IS INSIDE OF HER NOW.

WE MUST TAKE HER BACK DOWN TO

THE BOX.

FOR HOW LONG?
FOREVER.
NO.

NO, THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY.

DAVID, SHE'S NO LONGER LAUREN
ANYMORE.

YOU CAN'T SAVE HER.

 HE'S LYING.

I CAN GET HER BACK.

YOU GIVE ME ANOTHER BODY, AND

I'LL GIVE YOU LAUREN.

FELIPE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED

HIMSELF FOR ANA MARIA.

ONCE THE WITCH HAS YOUR BODY,

YOU ARE DEAD.

THINK OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

>> PLEASE, DAVID.

WE MUST STOP HER NOW.

COME ON.

POOR LAUREN.

UGLY AND ABUSED, LOCKED AWAY.

YOU GONNA GIVE UP ON HER JUST
LIKE YOU DID MARCELA?

>> AAH!

D-D-DON'T SHOOT!

I SHOULD HAVE SHOT HER.

NO. YOU CAN'T KILL HER.

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

I SHOOT HER, I DIE, SHE TAKE MY

BODY.

WITH NO BODY...

WITHOUT -- WITHOUT A HOST,

SHE'LL DIE?

GO. BRING HER OUT.

I KILL HER.

YOU -- YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER,

YOU -- YOU'LL BE SAFE.

GO QUICK.

OKAY.

HOLD.

COME ON.

YOU WANT ME?!

I'M RIGHT HERE!

GIVE

YOURSELF TO ME AND I'LL LET JILL
LIVE.

IF I KILL YOU, I GIVE

YOU MY BODY, YOU PROMISE TO LET

JILL LIVE?

YES.

I KNOW ALL YOUR SECRETS, DAVID.

AAH!

I'M NOT GONNA KILL YOU.

WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

JILL! RUN!

>> AAH!

AAH!

COME ON. COME ON.

DAVID!

TO THE BASEMENT. LET'S GO!

COME ON.

SHE'LL COME DOWN HERE.

SHE HAS TO.

LAUREN'S BODY IS TOO WEAK.

SHE'LL NEED ONE OF US.

IT'S NOT GONNA BE YOU.

IF WE BOTH GRAB HER, THEN WE
CAN PUT HER BACK.

NO, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

YOU STAY AWAY FROM HER.

I'LL GET HER BACK IN THE BOX.

IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO
DESTROY HER.

IT'LL BE OKAY.

MY LITTLE PUSS-PUSS.

GATITA.

WHAT?

YOUR MOTHER USED TO CALL YOU

THAT WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE.

YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

ONE DAY, YOU STOOD UP ON THIS

CHAIR AND YOU SAID, "I AM NOT A

LITTLE KITTY, AND MY NAME IS

JILL."

REALLY?

DAVID.

YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME.

SHE WAS SO...

PASSIONATE.

SO STRONG. REMEMBER?

I REALIZED TOO LATE THAT'S WHY I

FELL IN LOVE WITH HER.

SHE WASN'T GONNA GET ANY BETTER.

SHE KNEW IT, TOO.

I'M SORRY.

I'M SO SORRY.

YOU'RE A LOT LIKE HER, YOU KNOW?

YEAH?

DAVID!

LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO HIDE,
OKAY?

PROMISE ME YOU WON'T COME OUT
UNTIL AFTER SHE'S GONE, OKAY?

I LOVE YOU, DAD.

I LOVE YOU, GATITA.

FROM THE MOMENT YOU WERE BORN.

OKAY.

DAVID.

I'M FINISHED WITH THIS BODY,
DAVID.

AND NOW I WANT YOURS.

MARCELA?

NO. NO.

SHALL I

CONTINUE?

DON'T.

IT'S NOT YOU.

MORE?

IT'S NOT YOU. NO.

IT'S NOT YOU!

GIVE YOURSELF TO ME!

YOU ARE TOO WEAK TO PUT ME BACK

IN THE BOX!

I CAN'T.

IT'S MARCELA, BABY.

MARCELA.

MARCELA.

MARCELA.

PLEASE.

 MARCELA.

LET ME GO.

MARCELA.

KILL ME AGAIN.

I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

I CAN'T.

I CAN'T.

>> YOU ARE USELESS TO ME.

YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GONNA

DO WITH YOUR BODY.

YOU DON'T KNOW ALL MY
SECRETS.

NO!

>> NO!

>> DAD, DAD, SHUT THE DOOR.

SHUT THE DOOR.

WHAT DID YOU DO?

COME ON. PLEASE.

PLEASE!

JUST DO IT!

I LOVE YOU, DADDY.

NO, WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

NO, NO!
DAD!

LISTEN TO ME.

I WON'T LEAVE YOU.

YOU HAVE TO GO!

NO, YOU HAVE TO GO!

YOU HAVE TO GO!

I LOVE YOU.

I'M SO SCARED, DAD.

NO, DEAR GOD. TAKE ME.

NO, NO. JILL. JILL.
JILL.

NO!

TAKE ME.

TAKE ME.

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ME!

AAH!

 DON'T LEAVE ME

HERE TO DIE.

LIKE MOM.

IT ALL STARTED WITH A SECRET.

WE ALL HAVE THEM.

EVERYONE'S IS DIFFERENT.

MOST SECRETS DON'T CARRY MUCH
WEIGHT.

BUT SOME...

SOME SECRETS CAN DESTROY

EVERYTHING YOU LOVE.

I'LL BRING JILL HOME.

I WILL NOT QUIT.

I WILL FIND A WAY.

I WILL GET MY DAUGHTER BACK.

DADDY.
