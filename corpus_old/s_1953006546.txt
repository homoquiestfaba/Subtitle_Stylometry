For the love of God,
please ask me the question now.

Geography.

"What is the second largest city

in the Soviet Union?"

Moscow is the largest.
Any fool would know that.

A clever man might say Novosibirsk,

'cause it's the capital of Siberia.

Might be overthinking things.
Might.

Uh-oh.

Is it St. Petersburg?

Yes, I believe it is St. Petersburg.

Thank you. Thank you.
I am a trivia god.

I am so sorry, buddy.

Beg your pardon?

It's Leningrad.

And it's my turn.

Leningrad is St. Petersburg.
They're the same city, Paul.

No, I said which Soviet city,
not which Russian.

And during the Soviet era,
it was Leningrad.

Says so right here on the card.
See? "Leningrad."

Yes, it does say that on the card,
because this game is from 1984.

Yeah.
I will not be denied

my sweet-tasting victory

just because you can't pay $40
for another Trivial Pursuit.

Money has nothing to do with it.

I've had this game since I was six.

Playing with a new edition
would feel like...

like Alex Trebek
without his moustache.

It just wouldn't feel right.
I like him without the moustache.

You like that moustache on him?
Oh, yeah.

Let's say we ask
the sultry young Shelly.

James.

Shelly!

Yeah?
Hi, Shelly.

Alex Trebek's facial hair...
what say you?

<i>Sine qua non?</i>

I don't speak geek, dude.

It's not geek.
It's Latin.

I can teach you
if you wanted to learn.

You guys want another
round of drinks or something?

Not for me.

I have a date with
my endless dissertation.

Dissertation?
Constipation.

Come on, Paul.

The night is still young,
the grog is flowing,

the women are scrumptious
and, more importantly,

we have more time
for another trivia game.

I can't.
Classes start tomorrow.

I have to finish
this thesis from hell if it kills me.

You've been saying that
for eight years.

It's time to stop screwing around.

It's time to be a man.

And what, pray tell,
are you going to do after graduation?

I don't know.
What do you mean by "after"?

What do you mean by "man"?

Good night, James.

Free hug?

Yeah.

All right.
Thanks, man.

You're welcome.

Free hug, dude?

Uh, no.

Oh. I... Hello?

Excuse me.

Hi.

Hi.

Do you know how to get
to the Natural Resources Building?

There it is.

Did I mention I'm incredibly dense?

And a freshman?

Well, that's okay.
They're one and the same.

They've done tests and everything.

"They"?

Yeah, the guys that
do the tests on all the...

Oh, on the stuff. Right.
Yes, on that.

Okay.

Better get to class.
Okay.

Thank you.
Sure.

Actually, you know what?

I have class in this building too.
The Bible as Literature.

Yeah. Me too.

Really?
Yeah.

Apparently, the professor
is famous in Ann Arbor.

I'm Paul, by the way.

Oh. I'm Naomi.

You want to sit together?

I don't know anyone.

I totally would.

I just... I kind of
have to sit back here.

There's assigned seating in college?

Just for me. I'm a TA.

Oh.

So you're old?

Yes. Yes, I am.

Oh. Okay.

Bye.

Paul, <i>bonjour</i>.

Lucas Brannstrom.

I haven't seen you
since that Foucault seminar.

No, it's...
Paul, it's not "Foucault."

It's "Foucault."
It's in the throat.

But it's very difficult for you Americans
to pick up the subtleties of our language.

You're not French.

No, I'm Swedish.

But Foucault visited
Stockholm many times.

Hey, I didn't realize they were letting
comp lit guys TA this semester.

Well, I've wanted to work

for this professor
for a very long time.

He's very selective.

How many times have you
been a TA in this course?

Five.

Oh.

That is amazing.

You must be a very gifted scholar.

Hello, folk!

Good morning
and a rich welcome to you.

Marvelous to be with you.

I expect that you're as happy
to be back as I am

after the languid ease
of the summer,

lounging on the beach
and so on, eh?

Back to the urgency
of the life of the mind.

Yea, nay?
Yea.

Yea.
Yea.

Many of you I recognize.
Some I haven't seen yet.

I'll get to know your faces
and attach names to them

by about the second
and third day of class.

Hi.
Hi.

And then if you're absent, you see,
I'll miss you the first day.

Hi. Good to see you.

Your name?
Naomi.

Naomi. Thank you.
Welcome.

Hi. Ciao.

I'll get over to those

on the other side
of the room next day,

and soon I'll have names and faces

and the intimate details
of the lives of each of you.

This is English 401,

the Bible in English,
The Bible as Literature.

Let me begin

by inviting you on a journey

and inviting you
to take that journey

with an open mind

to your first, or a fresh,

confrontation

with collections of texts...

collections which are variously

in the Jewish and Christian traditions
called "the Bible."

It's a journey into
the heart of those texts,

a journey into the heart
of our culture,

and a journey, as well,

if you choose to make it so,

into the heart of yourselves.

My name is Elliot Tarson.

I'll be your companion
on this journey.

I'd like also to introduce

my four colleagues
in the course,

your section leaders.

First, there is Nick Laroussa

and Jessica Young

and Lucas Brannstrom,

and my own brilliant son...

forgive me, I'm so proud... Paul,

who has been with me
in the course a number of times.

Could you stand for a moment
and say hello

so that the whole group
gets to know you?

Hello.

Wonderful.

Paul, you are the professor's son.

Yeah.

Hey, Mom.
Hey.

Got the ketchup
for the loaf of meat.

Perfect.

Oh, and I want a full update
on class today.

Class was great.

Good.

Your father is in the study.

He wants to talk to you.

Okay.

Hey, Dad.

Fantastic lecture today.

Oh, you do know how
to flatter the old man.

Paul, I want to have

a discussion with you for a moment.

Sit.

Um, okay.

I ran into your advisor earlier,

and I must say I'm worried

that you haven't made adequate
progress towards your degree.

Dad, I've been working
on my dissertation a lot.

I mean, a lot.

Were you working on it a lot

when I saw you the other day

going into the pub
with your friend James?

Paul,

I instructed Dr. Hoguefeld

that this is to be your last semester

of funding from the department.

Wait. What?

It's time for you to take your degree.

Dad, my dissertation...

I still have to look
over Hoguefeld's notes,

and... and... and I haven't
even started on Whittier yet.

Okay.

I've been kind of stuck.

Oh, son, that's nothing to be
embarrassed about at all.

You mentioned Whittier.

I touch on Whittier in Chapter 32

of the <i>Tarson Guide</i>.

It may be of help to you.

Yea?

Yea, nay?

Yea.

"My opinion on this topic
matter are opposing heroes

is biologically and mentally 'retardment."'

This is a 16-year-old
in my SAT class.

16. He does not know
the correct word for retarded,

and he wants to go to college.

This is what my genius
is wasted on in test prep...

"retardment."

I'm gonna graduate.

Yeah, yeah, I know.

Really. I lost my funding.

I have to graduate this semester.

What are you gonna do?

This.

Trivia and beer.

The god of geekdom

has rewarded our lifetime
of worshipping his nerdy altar.

Yes! I knew you'd be down.

Of course I'm down.
Jesus, I work in test prep.

I have no life.
What about you, though?

You're gonna graduate?
What about your dissertation?

No, to hell with it.
I am so sick of all this

giant life-altering crap.

That is the beauty of trivia, my friend.

It is trivial...
totally and absolutely meaningless.

Okay. So what you're saying is
that we need to do this

precisely because
we do not need to do this.

Yes.
That's compelling.

Six big rounds of hardcore,

no-holds-barred trivia
at bars all over the city.

We are talking hollow glory.

We are talking pointless honor.

We are talking groupies who
are vaguely unattractive at best.

Groupies?

Yes, groupies.

I foresee one difficulty... sports.

Sports?
Sports.

Sports is an essential part of trivia.

I mean, I can list and diagram
every organelle inside of a cell,

but I have never once attempted
a stuff shot in a basket hoop.

Okay, all right. Relax.
I'll figure it out.

This is not gonna be easy.

We're talking about practice, training,

honing our intellects
every single day.

If we're gonna do this,
we're not gonna half-ass it.

We're gonna need both cheeks.

Of course. But that's
the best thing about this.

At the end of the day,
none of it matters.

I mean, who gives a crap
whether we win or lose?

But we will win, won't we?

Yeah, sure. Maybe.
All right.

Yeah!
You need to work on that.

Come on, Tarson.
Get your head in the game.

Hello, folk!

Welcome.

This is...

This is English 401,

Section 12 of
the Bible as Literature.

My name's Paul.

And in case you missed it,

I am, in fact,
the son of the man,

the myth, the legend,
Professor Tarson himself.

Okay, let's get started.

Let's pull out your
<i>Tarson Guides</i> to Chapter 1.

Excuse me?

If you have a question,
please raise your hand.

Excuse me.

Thank you.

Yeah, can you please tell us
a little bit more about yourself?

Uh, well...

I think I said
I'm Professor Tarson's son.

No, I mean,
something about you.

We all know who your dad is.

I mean, what else do you study?

Do you study
other ancient religions

or just Scriptures
from the Bible or...

Well, okay.

I'm a doctoral student in English lit,

but, yes, I do study the Bible.

And that is study,
not preach, per se.

Specifically,

my dissertation investigates
the King James Bible

and the many points
of intersection

within Western literary canon,

with a focus on

the significance
of language and communication

as a locus to the transcendent,

while embodying complex tropes

and even perhaps

both communal
and individual identity,

which, not surprisingly,

lends itself to a vital tension

of the static versus the dynamic...

Sorry.

...as is often

made manifest in the pre
and postmodern era.

What the hell?

Hands, please.

Okay, but what do you hope
to get from it?

I mean, why do you study the Bible?

Okay. Naomi, I know
that you're new at this,

but this class is not about religion,
it's about literature.

That's not what I mean.
What I mean...

And it is imperative that we approach
this topic dispassionately.

That's not possible.
It's absolutely possible.

Trust me. Okay?
Moving on.

Look, I don't know a thing
about the Bible, okay?

My parents are atheists.
Never read it before in my life.

But I see how important
that book is to so many people,

and I want to understand that.

I mean, that's why I'm here.

That's why I'm studying the Bible.

See?

The Bible absolutely saved my life.

Really?
Yeah.

I read the Bible every night
before I go to bed, religiously,

and I'm not even religious.
If we could...

I remember the first time I read the Bible,
when I was four years old.

There's something about the stories.
I mean, Heston in <i>The Ten Commandments</i>.

One of my moms is a rabbi.

I just need the credits.

Enough.

That's enough.

I'm the teacher in this class.

Me.

And we have
a lot of work to do.

So, if you wouldn't mind

pulling out your <i>Tarson Guides</i>
and turning to Chapter 1.

She sounds positively succulent.

She's a student.
Oh, come now, Paul.

Are you gonna tell me
that you've never fantasized

about having a sexy young sultress

in your office hours alone?

She's got a plaid school outfit on,

knee-high white stockings,

ruffled pink panties,

brand-new penny loafers,
oiled leather, lace.

You bend her over your hard oaken desk,
teach her the ways of the gun.

No.

Really?

That's the whole reason
I became a teacher.

It's unethical.
It's unprofessional.

It's completely against university bylaws.
Besides, she's a freshman.

Aha. Forbidden fruit,
ripe for the plucking.

Virile, nubile, tactile...

Okay, can we talk about trivia, please?

Fine. And what, might I ask,

have you determined
about our sports dilemma?

The guy is a sports genius.

I went to Catholic school
with him back in the 4th grade.

The fourth grade?

You're telling me you haven't
seen this guy in 15 years?

How do we know he's any good?

He was the class jock.
In fourth grade.

James, you should've seen the way
this guy dominated kickball.

He could kick that thing for miles.
Yeah, in fourth grade.

He's the only athlete
I've ever been friends with.

Would you please
give him a chance?

Uh, Izzy.

Izzy Dasselway.

Oh, God, no.
Hey, man.

Thanks for coming down.
Long time no see.

You ready for this action?

You ready for this?

I'm Ice, bitch.
Right now.

Do it. Do it. Do it.

Uh, okay.

This is, uh, James Koogly.

It's a pleasure.

Ice will get in your head.

And when Ice is in
your goddamn head,

you ain't gonna get the Ice out.

I am freakin' Ice...

Oh, shit.

All right. Welcome all
to the first annual

Ann Arbor Pub Trivia Tournament,

sponsored by L'Italia wine

and Sex Candy,
edible prophylactics.

Sex Candy. Tastes so good,
you'll buy it for the meal.

I'm Brian Collins,
and this is my lovely assistant, Shelly.

Oh, yeah.
Hey, Brian,

is that a pen in your pocket,
or are you excited

to do some trivia?

Yes. Yeah.
I'm excited to do trivia.

Team name.
What's our team name?

I have been brainstorming
about this, okay?

What do you think
of Apostles of Angst?

Or... Okay, okay.

Or The Many Secret Loves
of Anais Nin?

Ice Tigers.

The name is Ice Tigers.

Okay. That, uh...

That's intriguing, but perhaps...

Right now, trivia contests
are being held

at other inferior bars
all over our great city.

The top three teams
from each bar

will go on to compete
in the next round

until the championship,
where the final six teams

will compete
for ultimate supremacy.

Oh, hey, look who it is.
It's Paul, huh?

You're the ultimate scholar,
I hear, right?

Hey, is Daddy gonna come
and help you out on the team tonight?

'Cause looking at the team,
you're definitely gonna need it.

Hey, Brannstrom,
you comp lit pricks think you're so cool

just because you study literature
in two different languages.

Yeah, that's about right.
We do.

Damn Swede.
Yeah.

The first half of tonight's contest

consists of 20 questions
worth one point each.

Here we go.
Question one.

"What ruler famous for his laws

"created the ancient empire of Babylonia

in 16th century BCE?"

Hammurabi. Next.

"What is the largest bird of prey
in the Western Hemisphere?"

And, no, it is not Shelly.

What about the penguin?

They catch fish with their claws.

Andean condor.

One minute left.

"What Baroque composer is best known
for his classic work <i>Messiah?</i>

Was this composer born "ba-roke,"
or did they just die "ba-roke"?

20 seconds.

Five, four, three, two, one.

Right. The next category is sports.

Ice is all over this shit.

"What professional golfer

won the first ever Green Jacket
awarded to a Masters Champion?"

Izzy?

Ice.

Five seconds.

Ice has no idea.

"Ice has no idea"?

Ice is supposed to be
the stinking sports expert.

He is.
But not golf.

Okay, okay.

There are a lot of other sports.

It's okay.
Next question.

"Who captained
the French national soccer team

that won the 1984 Olympics?"

Who is it?
Soccer.

What the shit do they think Ice is,

a goddamn Euro-fag?

Okay, Ice.

Are there any sports
that Ice does know?

The big ones...
basketball, football...

"What is the name
of the first Japanese player

ever to play for
the American major leagues?"

Yeah, pretty much just
basketball and football.

And kickball.

I'll take these. All right.

All right. At the end of the first half
of tonight's contest,

in first place so far,

with an impressive showing
of 18 out of 20 points,

we have Den Mördaren
av Kultur och Himmelak-Själ.

Tied for second
and third place, with 17 points,

are the Sig Apes...
Yeah!

...and Moo Shu Dork.
Yeah!

And in fourth place,
with 15 points, the Ice Tigers.

And, no, fellas, the first Japanese
baseball player in the US

was not Noriyuki "Pat" Morita.

This is absolutely ridiculous.

Those frat morons
are beating us.

If we keep this up,
we're not gonna make it

to the next round of the tournament.
Wait.

No. No.

Men, we can do this.

It's gonna take a little luck,
but I believe in the Ice Tigers.

Now, come on.
We have an entire half to go.

That is 20 more questions, right?

The final half of the contest
consists of only one question.

Damn.

And the category is sports.

Ah, <i>mutatis mutandis!</i>

Don't mess with the Ice in Latin!

I shit Latin!
Okay, okay.

Calm down. Calm down.

Now, I didn't know
if it would come to this,

but I think it's officially time
for my special trivia pen.

What's so special about it?

Well, it's got my name on it...

Paul.

Ice digs.

The final question is an identification.

"Name each of the colleges

that goes with the school mascots
pictured here."

Ice. Shit.

Oh, and one last bonus.

You see that little box
at the bottom?

That's double or nothing.
You check that box,

you get them all right,
you get double the points,

worth a possible 20 total.

But you get even one of them wrong,

and you get nada.

This is all Ice.

Are you...

Ice, do it.

Ten seconds left.

All right. Here we go.

This is it.

In first place, with 38 points,

an impressive showing,

our first qualifier for the next round

of the Ann Arbor Trivia Tournament,

Den Mördaren
and blah, blah, blah.

Good for you, dude.

Jackass.

Our next qualifier,

in second place tonight,
The Sig Apes.

This is a travesty of competitive trivia.

There's one more spot.

And our final qualifier,
in third place with 35 points...

and I didn't think these guys
were gonna pull it off...

The Lice Floggers.

Wait. Who?

Oh. Sorry.
Ice Tigers.

We won!
Yes!

Nobody shits the Ice.
Ice is in your head.

We're number three,
mucus mucockis!

I'm a qualifier.

I've never qualified
for anything in my whole life.

I work in test preparation.

That's right.

Let's get a drink.
Yeah.

Yeah.

Right on.

Hey, Naomi. Hey.

Oh, is it okay for me to speak,
or do I need to raise my hand?

Listen, I'm really sorry about that.

I get nervous when I talk
in front of people.

So maybe we can try again?

To talk.

To talk?

Yeah.

About the Bible.

Do you want to come
to my office hours?

I have a better idea.

Let's talk right now.

I can't right now.
You remember?

I have to sit with the TAs and...

I know.
Not in there.

Out there.

Wait. You mean...

Yeah. I heard
you can skip in college.

Apparently they don't even
take attendance.

I can't.

I'm a TA.

I have to be at lecture.
I can't skip.

Okay.

Later, Teach.

According to Richwell...

Are there questions
of me before I begin?

Excuse me. Hi.

Sorry, sir,
but lecture is about to start.

Listen, I gave it some thought,

and I think spending
the morning outside

would have definite
educational value.

Okay.

A story which is there is...

It's okay.
I'm her TA.

...and which,
in a long family line...

Gotta go.

...right to the point
which we associate with Rebekah.

What, is this, like, the first time
you've ever skipped class?

What? Come on. No.

It's okay.

It's my first time too.

So... the Bible.

Yes.

Hey, what's that?

What? Oh, that.

It's just some crap the university does
to help the kids relax.

Only morons do it.

Sweet.

No... Okay, seriously?

You don't understand.
I have no physical coordination whatsoever.

Oh, so you're useless?
Not useless.

Look, I'm great at trivia.
Do you play Trivial Pursuit?

Oh, so you're useless
and a giant geek.

Got it.

Come on.

Jump!

Are you okay?
Oh, yeah.

Hey, whatever happened to

"I just want to understand what makes
the Bible so important to people"?

I do.

That's why I'm working on my own religion,
thank you very much.

Little Thingie-ism.

"Little Thingie-ism."

The belief in life that only
the little things matter.

Okay.

"Okay"?

Like when someone
reads you a story.

Or when you're taking a bath,

and you've been in there
for way too long,

and you look down
and you have those ugly,

crinkly, pruney fingertips,

and it makes you laugh
just like that.

Or you're busy moon bouncing
when you should be in lecture hall.

Yeah, sure.

It's not like you're paying
to go to school or anything.

Oh, yeah. Well, why don't I just
spew a bunch of nerd speak

and call it a day?
Careful.

Try this.

Take it easy.
Boom!

Okay.
Bring it.

All right.

You're such a dork.

I'm okay. I'm okay.

You know, you never answered
my question in class, by the way.

What's that?
Why do you study the Bible?

I don't know.

I never really thought about it, honestly.

I don't like to teach.

Hate it, actually.

Okay. Well, then,
why would you...

Okay, I was an undergrad,

and I thought about doing
a lot of different things,

and then I took
my dad's Bible as Lit class.

Your dad's Bible lit class?
Yeah.

So, you went here as an undergrad?

Yeah. I've lived in Ann Arbor
my whole life.

What?

What a loser.
I would've gone crazy.

I couldn't wait
to get out of the house.

What? Wait a minute.
Where are you from?

Bloomfield Hills.

Bloom... Come on!

That's, like,
45 minutes from here.

It is a really long 45 minutes.

Oh, please.
Listen, listen.

Ann Arbor is a great place
to spend your life, okay?

Okay.
You out-of-towners all come in here

for your frat parties
and your football games.

By the way, I've never been
to one of those games. Not one.

And I am proud of it, because there's
a lot more to this city than that...

things that you can only
learn through time,

through experience, commitment.

I could show you a few things.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

You just asked me out on a date.

Yeah. Yeah, I did.

Good.

Good.

And we are totally going to a game.

You've really never been
to a Michigan game?

Never.
That's just weird.

You're weird.

Next question.

Okay.

"What award does the winner of
the PGA Championship receive?"

Starts with a W.
Hey!

Okay.

The...

Ends with an "er" sound.

"Er."

All right.

Sounds like a swan, okay?
Think about a swan.

Swanamake...

The Wanamaker Trophy.
Yes! Yes!

You is the Ice.

God! <i>Vigilantibus aequitas</i>.
Shit.

No hints. No hints.

I understand that you want us
to improve, okay?

But is the implementation
of torture really necessary?

This isn't torture.

I got this from a friend of mine
in the psych department. It's science.

Maybe I should use this
in my test prep class, huh?

You think these clamps
would attach to a human nipple?

You're not in grad school, slicky?

No, slicky ain't
in grad school, thank you...

Wait. What do you do, huh,
oh, spastic homunculus?

The lumberyard.

The lumberyard.
Jesus Chri...

I'm teammates with
"Hacksaw" Jim Duggan over here.

What do you guys think
about getting team shirts?

Ice. Yes. Shit.

Oh, damn it.
I gotta run.

What do you mean you gotta run?
Where you gotta run?

Ice, you're in charge
of team shirts.

Done.
From now on,

we meet here every morning
at 9 a.m. To practice.

No more third place.

We got a shot to win this bad boy.

Wait, wait. 9 a.m.?
Don't you have class then?

Yeah. Apparently they don't
even take attendance.

That's how ice skating goes.

That I know...

We're number two!

Okay.

Here. Stop here.

Okay.

This is where I went
to grade school and high school.

Father Gabriel Richard.

Three blocks from the university?

Father Gabriel Richard founded
the University of Michigan.

Besides, it's at least 20 blocks
away from my preschool.

That's a big deal.

Come on.

Oh. I'm catching up.

Hey, leave your bike here.

Okay.

Come on.
Okay.

Almost there. Okay?

Yeah.
And this is it.

The infamous rope swing.

Oh, awesome.

When I was a kid,

I used to come up here
all the time

and watch my friends
swing out and let go.

What about you?

Not once.

Bye.

Oh, my God.
It's freezing.

My nuts are the size of peas!

What are you doing?

What do you think I'm doing?

What...

Here goes nothing.

Oh, my gosh.

Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm awesome.

Wow.

It's worse than I thought.

What's that?

This is an original edition.

Yeah, that's right.
You wanna play?

I'll go easy on you, I swear.

What does this tell me about you?

About the real Paul Tarson?

Absolutely nothing.
That's the point.

Really?

What?

Nothing.

Read me something.

What?
Something from the Bible.

Oh, come on. You've got your paper
on the brain. It's due in two weeks.

I would really like
to hear your favorite story.

Please?

All right, all right.

"Now, the serpent was more subtle

"than any beast the Lord God had made.

"And he said to the woman,

"'Did God really say you shall not eat
from the tree in the garden? '"

"And the woman said to the serpent,

"'We must not, or we will die.'

"But the woman saw the fruit
was pleasing to the eyes,

"so she took it and ate it

"and gave it to her husband to eat."

"Then they heard the Lord God
walking in the cool of the garden,

"and they hid.

"The Lord God
called to Adam and said,

"'Did you eat from the fruit
I commanded you not to eat? '"

"And Adam said, 'I did.'"

"So the Lord God banished him
from the garden of Eden..."

"...to work the earth
from which he'd been taken."

Thank you.

When I was a kid, my dad was...

away at lectures a lot
and conferences,

always surrounded by
students and academic bigwigs,

that kind of thing.

So the only time that
I really had him to myself

was when he was reading me
Bible stories,

like that one.

He, uh...

He could really bring them to life.

All of them...
Solomon, David, Moses.

And, well, it was amazing.

It was like the two of us were
really there, together, you know?

That's the reason.

That's the reason I decided
to study the Bible.

That's beautiful.

Although it's not like having his wife

turned into a pillar
of salt did Lot any good.

It's not like God
turned him into a deer.

Get it?

Deer, salt... lick.

Oh, God.

Okay. Okay.

Don't forget to leave your papers
on the chair as you leave.

Thanks.

Hello. Good to see you.

Good to see you.

Hello, David. How are you?
Good to see you.

Professor, good to see you.
Hi, Alison.

Hey, Dad.

What brings you to this side
of the building?

So sorry to intrude, son,
but I couldn't wait

to tell you the good news.

Good news?
What's going on?

I'm going to retire.

What? Why?

Well, it's getting time for me

to cultivate my garden, son.

And with you

finishing your doctoral dissertation,

at last,

this is an ideal time
to pass on my legacy.

Dad, what's going on?

A new assistant professorship.

And with your unique knowledge

of my work and this university,

there's a genuine chance

that you could be appointed
in my place.

Take your place?
