Not until they get me

Jack, you got a second?
Not now.

Chelsea cops got caught
running numbers again.

The <i>Globe</i> and the <i>Herald</i> ran it today.
We got nothing.

Come on. Don't you have an assignment?

Okay, what about the new suspect
in the mail truck robbery?

Every other paper covered it.

You see that? That's the crime desk.
I got six guys working that beat.

Okay, Susan,

you're on must-have housewares.
[Susan] Thank you.

Mary, you got the fashion and style

[Mary] Mmm.

Ellie, you're on candidates' wives.

Who's that?

Uh, that is Holland's girl, Jean Cole.

is she a reporter or a nurse?

She's working undercover.
Got some story on nursing homes.

[Jean sighs]

Here. Use mine. I'll fix this one.


What are you working on?

Story on patient abuse.

That sounds important. How'd you get it?

I asked for it.

And they just gave it to you?

That's usually how it works.

Not around here, it isn't.

Sorry.

No.

Mrs. Slesers, right around the corner.

It was in your paper.

[police radio chatter]

[door closes]

[phone ringing]

Jack? I think I found something.

Three women were strangled
over the last two weeks.

I don't see the interest.
These are nobodies.

Who do you think our readers are?

And that's just it. Why would anybody
go around killing three nobody women?

And how do you plan to find that out?

Well, let me profile the victims.
See if there's any connection.

Kid, you're not covering a homicide.

Why not?

Because you don't have the experience
covering homicides.

How am I supposed to get any experience
if you won't give me a shot?

No.

Oh, come on. It's slow.

I'll do it on my own time.

All right.
But you're still on the lifestyle desk.

Uh, Loretta McLaughlin,
with the <i>Record American</i>.

You're the super? You found Ida Irga?

Yeah, that's right.

Uh...

Did it look like someone broke in?

No. No, the door was locked.
I had to use a master key.

Anything else unusual when you went in?

No.
Those details don't belong in your paper.

No, no, I... I'm not gonna print
anything disrespectful.

I'm... I'm just trying to get a sense.

You really wanna know?

I found her on the floor
with her legs spread open,

ankles strapped to a chair.

There was a broom handle
stuck between her legs.

You mean...
Yeah.

He tied her stockings
in a bow around her neck.

A bow?

Uh, you know who's working
the Anna Slesers homicide?

I'm with the <i>Record American</i>.

They're out. Why I never seen ya before?

I was working a different desk.
You know when they'll be back?

No clue. They're up to their eyeballs.

Yeah, I bet. Any suspects?

Talk to Corsetti. He already covered it.

I'm doing a different story
about how the murders are connected.

You mean the bows?

All three had bows around their necks?

I didn't say that.

No, I already confirmed Ida Irga.
Are you confirming Blake and Slesers?

I'm not confirmin' nothin'.
Why don't you take a hike?

Only one I can confirm is Ida Irga.

What about the autopsy reports?

DA won't release them.

Wasn't one of them in Lynn?

Helen Blake.

Well, that's Essex County.
Different county, different DA.

Corsetti,
you know the medical examiner in Lynn?


See if you can get
the Helen Blake autopsy.


Okay. [sighs]

Excuse me, I'm looking for Officer Dougan.

[officer 2] Dougan? No, he's not here.

You know where Foley's is?

[door creaks]

Officer Dougan?

Yeah.

Uh, Loretta McLaughlin
with the <i>Record American</i>.

Uh, you took the call for Anna Slesers?


I need to ask you a detail
about the crime scene.

I don't think I'm supposed
to be talking to the papers.

No, it's nothing like that.

Uh... Just wanna ask
about the stockings around her neck.

Did you see if they were tied
in a single or a double-hitched knot?

There's no way I could tell by looking.

I would've had to roll her over, and...
I'm just a patrolman.

I don't touch the bodies.

Did it look decorative?

In a real sick kind of way, yeah.

Thank you.

I just confirmed Slesers.
I've got confirmation on all three.

<i>All right. Get back here and write it up.</i>

<i>What do these three women have in common?</i>

<i>Three shadowy patterns of attack.</i>

<i>Three knotted loops

Or any of 'em.

You beat the whole damn city.

I can't believe it. This is incredible!

The story's bullshit.

Been getting calls all morning
from my guys in the department.

[buzzer sounds]
[Phyllis] <i>DA's office for you.</i>

Hold my calls, please.


You never should've sent her out on this.

Jesus Christ.

Ah, what can I do for you, Commissioner?

Was it your idea to send some skirt
down to the station house?

Well, her name's Loretta.
She was workin' a story.

Is that what you're callin' it now?

Hanging around the bar,
flirtin' with my guys?

Never even identified herself

Now I've got every old lady in
the fuckin' city tying up my phone lines!

Just tell me what we got wrong,
and I'll print a correction.

It's barstool gossip, for Christ's sake!

Half the news in the city's
barstool gossip.

What the hell did we get wrong?

Homicide has been workin'
around the clock on this,

and we've got nothin'
to connect the murders.

What about the stockings?

Only one of the victims in Boston
had that.

The other one looks like a suicide.

We got sources for both women...
Sources!

It was a couple of dipshit beat cops
trying to bed that girl you sent down!

I'm telling you this as a friend.

If you keep running this story,
you're gonna end up embarrassing yourself.

[chattering]

Shut the door.

I am catching hell over this story.

Now, Commissioner McNamara
says the whole thing's gossip.

Same with Corsetti's sources.

I confirmed every word of that story.

You identified yourself as a reporter?

Of course I did.

Even at the bar?
Especially at the bar.

I'm killin' the follow-up.

We beat everyone in the whole damn city,
and you're... you're just gonna drop it?

Yes, I am.

The story is good.

The story is a headache

Not yet? It's 40 minutes to deadline.

There's no listings

Is there only one killer?

any person into their home

they are a proper person.

Especially women living alone!
Are you confirming the story...

Keep your doors locked,

Are you confirming the story

Is there only one killer?

I don't care if it's one killer or four.
We're gonna catch whoever did this.

You're gonna let that asshole bother you?

You don't mind being called a fluke?
By that jackass?

Let 'em sell their papers. You still got
the biggest story in the city.


over the past three months.</i>

<i>By number and by nature,
these stranglings are beyond anything</i>

<i>ever seen before
in the criminal history of the city.</i>

The murders are clearly premeditated.
All elderly.

All lived alone. It's a pattern.

<i>The crimes themselves are insane.</i>

<i>He ransacks the apartments
but doesn't take anything.</i>

<i>He leaves his victims posed
with a bizarre air of ceremony,</i>

<i>each left with a decorative garrote
around her neck.</i>

<i>In every case,
there is no evidence left behind,</i>

<i>no clue as to how he selects his victims.</i>

<i>He seems to come and go as he pleases,
committing his crimes in broad daylight.</i>

<i>It's highly organized behavior.</i>

Probably escalated over time,
and now he's lost control.

Barriers are down.
He'll almost certainly repeat.


What's this?

This is all for you two.

"I'm one of the many who can't sleep.

I find myself awake all night and too
frightened to leave during the day."

"Every day is an eternity,
every night a horror.

Nobody knows what a woman alone feels."

"No one knows fear as we know it."

The Boston Phantom...</i>

<i>The Boston Strangler must be caught.</i>

Guess he's got a name now.

Shit.

[chattering]
[chuckles]

Mmm.
Thanks.

So, uh, how'd you become Holland's girl?
He poach you from one of the other papers?

He got me a job
when I graduated high school.

I was working at a lunch counter
down by the courthouse.

He covered a trial
the summer before my senior year.

I got to know him pretty well, and so he
offered to get me a job when I turned 18.

Back then, just living through the day
was an accomplishment.

I wore my school clothes when they first
sent me out on assignments.

I didn't have money for anything else.

Holland took pity on me
and lent me money for a new suit.

I never wanted to let him down after that.

I learned to hold my own,

and he started sending me out
on bigger and bigger stories,

and it just became my life.

I really can't imagine
doing anything else.

It's crazy to think your whole life
can turn on a chance encounter.

My senior year, I, uh...
I lined up with all the other girls

to register for nursing school.

But my English teacher, Mrs. Welker,
she... she pulled me out of the line

and had me apply for a scholarship
to go to college.

And that was it.

I'd be changing bedpans
if it wasn't for her.

Thank God for Mrs. Welker.

Another woman turned up. I've gotta go in.

You gotta be kidding me.
It's New Year's Eve for Christ's sakes.

Who's gonna take your mother home?


Go. I'll deal with it.

[footsteps departing]


Mom had to go to work.


There's Joe.

[shutter clicks]

Hey, hey, asshole. Come on. Come on.

That's enough.


That guy came to my door earlier today.

He said he was here
to paint the apartment, so I let him in.

All of a sudden, he tells me I'm pretty
and asks me if I thought about modeling.

I got nervous,
told him my husband was home.

I pretended to go back and get him,
and when I came back, he was gone.

What time was this?

Uh, this afternoon. Three o'clock.

Could you describe him for me?

Uh, normal. White guy, dark hair.

He had workman's clothes on.

He just looked regular.

[professor on phone]
<i>She doesn't fit the pattern.</i>

<i>To switch from all elderly women
to a young girl is unheard of.</i>

<i>When these guys establish a type,</i>

How sure are you?

<i>That's the going theory

<i>But no one really knows.</i>

Did you know they were gonna do this?

You really think this is smart?
With that lunatic still out there?

I don't know what to say. All right?

Stanley was supposed to shoot
the damn crime scene.

Yeah. Right.

I'm gonna go have a cigarette.

I'll be right back.

Hey.

Got a smoke?

Been reading your stories.
They've been pretty good.

Well, have you got any leads?

Off the record.

Off the record? More than we can handle.

Are you close to making an arrest?

These people have no idea
what they're up against.


Uh, the whole department,
as far as I'm concerned.

The whole police department?


There's no motive, and then he takes off
without leaving a shred of evidence.

Guy's as careful as he is deranged.

Nice talking to you.

I don't think so.
School took up most of her time.

And the choir.
It's where a lot of her friends were from.

At church?

At BU, where she was studying.

Oh. That's where I went.


I always thought she'd end up
being someone like you.

You know, with a job she loved,
living on her own terms.

I admired that about her.

She was doin' all the things I wish
I could've done with my own life.

You have kids?

Yeah. Uh, three.

Maggie's nine.
The boys are seven and five.

when she was that age.

Only way I could get her to calm down
was by singing to her.


I'm sorry, I just...
I just can't stop thinking about it.

What he did to her.
What that must have been like for her.


[choir vocalizing]

with her boyfriend.

She was taking advantage of her freedom.

Did you meet any of the guys
she was seeing?

Yeah, but they were all harmless.

It's her ex that she was afraid of.

Uh... Sorry, who is that?

Daniel Marsh.

Why was she afraid of him?

He was harassing her.

He had just gotten kicked out of Harvard,
was acting really erratic.

He'd call in the middle of the night,
show up unannounced. Things like that.

And when was this?

Right up until around when it happened.

[doorbell buzzes]

Daniel Marsh?

Yes?

Loretta McLaughlin
with the <i>Record American</i>.

You knew Beverly Samans?

Come inside.

[door closes]

Come in. Come in.

It's just back here.

[machine rattling]

We can talk just back here.

Uh, I've just remembered that I've got,
uh, another appointment.

I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to come back another time.

[door slams]

[Loretta pants]


[footsteps approaching]
[doll] <i>Please take me with you.</i>

Here's everything on Patricia and Nielson.


You okay?

Yeah.

Don't stay here all night.

I'm serious.

I won't.


Wait, what did you say his name was?

No, you called me.

Runnin' a hotline for the mentally unfit.
[Loretta chuckles]

That's everything.

All right. Give me some time. I gotta
wade through this pile of shit first.

Don't wait on these.

They're good leads.

[detective] Boston Police Department!
[gasps]

Gordon Nielson?

[Nielson] Yes.
[detective] Hands on the wall.





as your secretary?


with her outside of work?

Yes.

the night she was murdered?

No.

Can I have an update, Detective?

We caught Nielson removing evidence
from Patricia's apartment.

He failed two polygraph tests,

but the DA still doesn't think
he has a case,

and there's nothing tying him
to the other murders.

So, what about Daniel Marsh?

Who? The Harvard psycho?

He's batshit crazy, I'll give you that,
but we got nothin' on him.

Well, he was harassing Beverly
the week before she was killed.

Uh, you can't charge a guy
for getting high

and calling his ex-girlfriend
in the middle of the night.

What, so that's it?

I-I don't think you understand
what I'm dealin' with here.

I'm gettin' a hundred tips a day,

I got thousands of sex offenders
to screen,

and now the commissioner just ordered
a raid on every gay bar in the city.

I'm doing all I can,
but I'm not playing with a full deck.

I'll see ya later.

[car door opens]

How many gay bars in Boston
are there anyway?

There can't be that many.

Way to miss the point, Jack.

The point is Commissioner McNamara's
not up to the job.

What does that mean, exactly?

His head's shoved up his ass.

They won't coordinate
with other police departments,

connections are being missed,

and good leads
are falling through the cracks.

Isn't some of that to be expected?


Oh, I'm sorry, Jack, am I keeping you up?

Will you cut the shit already?
What's the story?

The city can't protect its women.
Come on.

What? You don't think it's true,
or you don't think it's a story?


You can't go after someone's livelihood
because you're impatient.

Ten women are dead,
and these assholes don't have a clue!

You don't have a story. You have a grudge.

How many women have to die
before it's a story?

That's enough.

These are good men busting their asses.

I'm not waging a war
on the police department.

[footsteps departing]

[chattering on TV]

Where you been?

I had to work late.

Oh, my God. Get a plate.
You're gonna make a mess.

I'm not gonna make a mess.

Sit down. I gotta talk to you anyway.

Look, I've had a long day. Can't it wait?

Loretta, sit down.

I took a new position at work.

It's better pay, but I have to be
in the Connecticut office part-time.

Part-time?

A few days a week.

How long's this been in the works?

Couple weeks.

And when were you gonna tell me about it?

A lot of long days lately.
Hasn't exactly been a good time.

How are we supposed to manage
with you gone half the week?

You're gonna have to do your share.

What more could I possibly do
short of quit my job?

Is this your way of telling me
to stay home? Is that what this is?

Come on.
Have I ever asked you to stay home?

No, you just do
something like this instead.

What, I'm free to do what I want as long
as it's on your terms, isn't that right?

You are unbelievable, you know that?

My... My sister's right about you.
You're just...

What?

Say it. Say it.

Most people would be happy
their husband got a promotion.

[slams table]

[line rings]

[Phyllis on phone] Record American.

Loretta McLaughlin or Jean Cole.

<i>One minute, please.</i>

[phone rings]

Loretta.

My name's Detective Linski, I'm with
the New York City Police Department.

I'm calling about a murder we had
down here couple of weeks ago.

Looks like it could be linked
to the stranglings.

Older lady.

Yeah, she turned up dead in a hotel room,

strangled with stockings
tied around her neck.

People from the hotel
saw the guy she was with.

Couple of nights later he shows up
at the hotel bar, so I pick him up...

still in his pocket.

<i>Only took me 45 minutes
to get a confession.</i>

<i>His name is Paul Dempsey.</i>

<i>Lives up in Maine,
but I can place him in Boston</i>

<i>at the time of the first five murders.</i>

Uh, I'm assuming
you went to Boston Homicide with this?

First call I made.
Couldn't get anyone to call me back.

<i>Couple of weeks go by,
so I make the trip up there myself.</i>

<i>Figure I'll just tell 'em in person.</i>

Couldn't get anyone to meet with me.
Can you believe that?

Detective drove four hours
for a homicide I'm working,

I'd walk out of my kid's christening
for that.

I don't know what the hell
they're doin' up there.

Turns out Paul Dempsey was a suspect
in a murder in Maine

four years
before the first Strangler murder.

The victim was an elderly woman
found strangled

with her stockings tied around her neck.

It could be the original Strangler murder,

but no one can get Boston Homicide
to look into it.

And this cop in New York
will go on the record?

Already did.

We're not running a hit job
on the police department.

They're blowing the investigation.
How long can we keep ignoring it?

I don't know how many times we have
to tell you, but we're not doing it.

I don't know, Eddie.

I mean, she's right.
We can't keep looking the other way.

You really wanna use this paper
to tear down the police department?

If anyone else was blowing it this badly,

we'd have put it on the front page
a long time ago.

All right.

You want to run with this?
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

But it's your neck on the block.
You understand?

All right.

[thunder rumbling]

is conducting the largest manhunt</i>

<i>in the city's history,</i>

and yet no trace, no trail,
no trip up has been detected.

<i>Without sharing evidence,
police may overlook a common denominator,</i>

<i>a missing link,
a clue that could identify the killer.</i>

Unless a centralized effort is set up
to catch the Strangler,

he will remain today
as he did one year ago,

a faceless, formless,
flawless executioner.

Holy shit.

Tomorrow's gonna be interesting.

Nice knowin' ya. Fun while it lasted.

[newscaster on TV] <i>The attorney general
held a press conference today</i>

<i>to announce that he is assuming command
of the Boston Strangler investigation</i>

<i>after a critical story
in the</i> Record American <i>.</i>

<i>He has appointed
Deputy Attorney General John Bottomly</i>

<i>to oversee the investigation.</i>

[commentator on radio]
<i>To suggest the Boston Police Department</i>

<i>is leaving any stone unturned is absurd.</i>

<i>And all this
because a couple girl reporters question</i>

<i>the credentials of our police department.</i>

[scoffs]
<i>I mean, what the hell do they know</i>

<i>about police work?</i>

[crickets chirping]

[Loretta] No, don't touch that!
[gasps]

Go back to bed.

[footsteps running]

Oh.

Someone came to the house?

They put it in the mail slot.
It was just me and the kids home.

You think it was a deranged cop
or some deranged asshole?

Well, I'm not exactly pleased
about it either way.

Where are you going?

Now, I didn't say anything when you put
our pictures in the paper,

but you and I both know what that was.
That was a stunt.

And I know you wanna sell your papers...
Calm down.

But at what cost?

There's more than one lunatic out there,
and you're gonna get us both killed!

You take it out!
I'll handle it.

They're not puttin' our picture
in the paper anymore.

I need a drink.

I don't know what
I'm supposed to do anymore.

[Jean] About what?
About everything.

You know, it's like I get to do half
of everything I really want

and everyone around me
still feels shortchanged.

James has had enough.

And my... my poor kids are spooked.

You know, most of my paycheck
goes to the babysitter now?

Who cares?

You're gonna make yourself crazy
worrying about everyone else all the time.


You can't be apologetic, not about
the things that are important to you.

How come you're so calm about everything?

Now, you've got kids.
It must be crazy for you too.

How do you keep
everything so under control?

My life's a three-ring circus.

The wheels have been about to fall off
since our youngest was born.

So, what do you want to do
about this story?

You sure you want to keep going with this?

[cash register dings]

Boston Police are keeping us in the dark.

They won't talk to any
of the other departments.

And they sure as hell don't want our help.

Would you go on the record with that?

Yeah. Go ahead, print my name.

Print this too.

Couple weeks ago,
we get a call about this guy,

was harassing these girls
in their apartment.

Then Boston won't share
any information with us.

So we just let him go.

I come to find out
he's one of their prime suspects.

We had him, and we just let him walk away.

What was his name?

Off the record...

Albert DeSalvo.

He's famous over in Cambridge.

Famous for what?
[sighs]

Making himself unwanted.


Brian, coffee?
Thank you.

Guys, coffee?

[desk officer]
All right, whose file you need?


Which one?
Sorry?

All the DeSalvo brothers
graduated from jail.

Which one ya need?
Albert.

[desk officer] Figures.
What, you know him?

Every cop in Cambridge knows him.
Al's a world-class creep.

Just got nabbed on rape charges
over in Malden.

He's in custody?
Yeah.

They got him up in Bridgewater right now.
Have fun.

the Green Man and the Measuring Man.

They called him the Green Man
'cause he put on green workman's clothes

and posed as the maintenance guy,

say he needed to check something
inside their apartments.

And, uh, what about the Measuring Man?

with this one,

but he'd pretend to be a modeling scout.

And he'd convince these girls to let him
in so he could take their measurements.

You wouldn't believe
how many people let him do it.

He told me I had a nice figure.
He said his agency would hire me.

He just needed to take some measurements.

But he didn't have a measuring tape.

He just used his hands.

<i>I got this horrible feeling.</i>

<i>My whole body just froze.</i>

[church bells tolling]



You remember Sophie's neighbor?
[Jean] Mm-hmm.

Uh, she said a man came to her apartment
the day Sophie was killed.

Now, first he said he was there
to paint the apartment,

and then he asked her
if she ever thought about modeling.

The Green Man slipped
into the Measuring Man. It's DeSalvo.



I can't be caught dead
talking to you right now.

That bad, huh?
No, I'm serious.

If you gotta call me at the station,
you say you're my sister Sally, all right?

What do you have for me?

It's not him.
Well, it has to be him. Look...

I mean, Sophie's neighbor said
he came to paint the apartment,

but then he slipped up
and started talking to her about modeling.

I mean, those are the two cons
DeSalvo is famous for.

I worked DeSalvo for weeks.
I loved him for it. It's not him.

What makes you so sure?

He was in prison
for the first six murders,

didn't get out
until after Sophie was killed.

Whoever was in that lady's apartment
wasn't DeSalvo.


What you're feeling right now,
that's every day for me.

You know how many people
I've gone down the rabbit hole with?

It's a dead-end every time with this case.

You get your teeth into something

and then your bottom falls out at three
in the morning, and you got nothin'.

And while I'm making myself crazy...

he's out there somewhere...

laughing at us.


[rain pattering]


[rain continues]


You still stuck on DeSalvo?

Everything lines up with him.

His history,
the progression of the crimes, everything.

in prison for the first six murders.

Have you seen the actual release records?




Look at this.

Oh, my God.

DeSalvo petitioned the judge
for early release.

He said he had to get back
to his wife and kids.

The judge let him out for good behavior.

So, he was out in time?

Two months before the first murder.

<i>A 33-year-old father of two
is considered a prime suspect</i>

<i>in the Boston Strangler case.</i>

<i>The suspect is presently confined
in a state mental hospital</i>

<i>for allegedly assaulting a woman
last December.</i>

We got beat.


A hotshot defense lawyer.
One of those press hounds.

How the hell did DeSalvo
get a hotshot lawyer?

I don't know.
You want me to go do your job for ya?


What's on the docket tonight?

about how Albert DeSalvo

got a high-priced defense lawyer.

Would someone familiar
with the investigation care to comment?

No.

when you went to question him?

[birds squawking]

Wouldn't let us interview him.</i>

<i>So, I brought Sophie Clark's neighbor in
to ID DeSalvo.</i>

She didn't recognize him?

Not only did she not recognize him,
she ID'd someone else.

Who?

George Nassar.

<i>Murdered a gas station attendant
during a robbery.</i>

Schizophrenic with a genius IQ.

And?

It's not him.
Been in custody for over a year.

[reporters clamoring]

a sigh of relief tonight.

The career of the Boston Strangler
is over.

[reporter 1] Is it true Mr. Bailey?
[reporter 2] He's telling the truth?

only the killer could know.

When I quizzed DeSalvo,
he went five for five.

[reporter 3] Mr. Bailey!

When you've done as many interrogations as
I have, you develop an ear for bullshit.

[reporters laughing]

And was law enforcement
a part of this process?

That's all I'm gonna say right now.

We're still negotiating his confession.
If you'll excuse me.

[shutter clicks]
[reporters clamoring]

[reporter 4] Will he confess?


The date is February 14th, 1964.

Albert, please state your full name.

Albert Henry DeSalvo.


because you intend to confess
to all 13 Boston Strangler murders.

Is that correct?

Yes.

Tell me about your first victim.

How did you pick Anna Slesers?

I didn't pick her in advance.

There was a parking spot
in front of the house.

If there hadn't been a spot,
I never would have got her.

what color robe was she wearing?


Hear about DeSalvo?

No. What?

They sent Bottomly
to take his confession last night.

Bottomly interviewed him for five hours.

And?

No one knows. He hasn't said a word.

Can I have a word, please?

I'll catch up.

What's going on with DeSalvo?

Nothing.

If he confessed,
why haven't they charged him?

Bailey used you guys
to pressure the attorney general,

and then he set one condition
for DeSalvo's confession.

Yeah, and what's that?
They're not allowed to use it in court.

They didn't agree to that.

They didn't have a choice
after you put DeSalvo on the front page.

But they think they can get life
on the rape charges.

And they're just gonna ignore the fact
that 13 women were killed?

That's all I got.

And I haven't even
told you the punch line yet.

You know how Bailey's gettin' paid?

He got DeSalvo a five-figure book deal.

A tell-all from the Boston Strangler.

Everyone just wants it to be over.

[footsteps departing]

They're washing their hands of it,

and that headline you're about to run
makes it easy for them.

Come on.
The murders stopped. The guy's in jail.

What the hell else you want?

They botched the biggest investigation
in the city's history,

and you're just gonna let them
sweep it under the rug.

Aw, come on, Loretta.
How much trouble you gonna cause me today?

Well, clearly not enough.

Get outta here. Just take the week off.

I'm not taking the week off.
I'm not asking.

The police are washing their hands of it,
and you expect us to move on.

Loretta.
We're not doing it.

I took a new assignment.

You've gotta be kidding me.

with you people.

Don't get it twisted. If there's
another murder, I'll drop everything.

But until then, we cover the news.
We don't make it.

[footsteps departing]

[footsteps approaching]

Place looks nice.

[Beverly's parent]
Oh. Sunlight always helps. [chuckles]

Been reading your stories. You think
they're finally gonna charge him?


That's what I want to talk to you about.

There's gonna be a story
in the papers tomorrow.

They're not gonna charge Albert
with Beverly's murder.

Or any of the murders for that matter.

I don't understand. If he confessed...

They made a deal with his lawyer, and
they can't use his confession in court.

But they have him on other charges.

And... And they're gonna make sure
that he never gets out of prison.

[Beverly's parent]
But what about my daughter?

It's not right
to just give up on her like this.

How can they do that?

[actor 1 on TV] <i>The price is Â£20,000.

[singing on TV continues]

[phone rings]

Yes?


Speaking. Who's this?

Detective DeLine, Michigan State Police.

I don't know if you're aware, but we had
six women strangled near Ann Arbor.

When was this?

We found the sixth victim last night.

Uh, you said they were strangled.
Anything else in common?

All the crime scenes were damn near
identical to the Boston Strangler.

<i>I've read your stories.</i>

I think it's safe to say
that you're an expert on the case.

<i>So, I wanted to ask you, do you still
think that Albert DeSalvo is the guy?</i>

What are you doing?

What do you think
you're gonna find out there?

When is this gonna stop, Loretta?
When are you gonna let this go?

Be careful, will you?

[footsteps departing]

Thanks. So, uh, have you got any suspects?

If I did,
I wouldn't be telling a reporter.

Off the record.

Off the record,
I wouldn't be telling a reporter.

You could've saved a lot of trouble
if you'd just called first.

Well, how about the case files?
Mind if I take a look?

How many cops let you look
at open case files?

Not many.

[DeLine grunts]

[DeLine sighs]




[meteorologist on radio] <i>...also like snow.</i>

<i>We're gonna have quite a bit,

<i>Looks like we'll have snow

<i>We can expect at least several more
inches ending later in the day tomorrow.</i>

<i>Then, clearing tomorrow night,
becoming mostly...</i>


Yeah.

I'm gonna have to call you back.

Daniel Marsh's ex-girlfriend was killed
by the Boston Strangler.

He was my favorite suspect for her murder,
and he's here in Ann Arbor.

Won't you have a seat?

Off the record,
he's our prime suspect right now.

You're the second person from Boston
to report him.

Are you gonna charge him?


Why didn't you say something earlier?

Because we're not having
this conversation.

Who was the other person who reported him?

The medical director from Bridgewater.

Uh, Dr. Robey please.



Uh, Loretta McLaughlin
with the <i>Record American</i>.

<i>What can I do for you?</i>

Uh...

Why did you report Daniel Marsh
to the Michigan State Police?

<i>I'm sorry.
I can't discuss one of my patients.</i>

He was a patient of yours?

<i>Yes.</i>

At Bridgewater?

<i>Well, yes. That's where my patients are.</i>

<i>Is there anything else
I can help you with?</i>

No. Thank you.

[line rings]


I need you to call in a favor.

<i>I thought you weren't speaking to me.</i>

I'm not.

<i>All right, what?</i>

I'm Jean Cole, Deb McNulty's expecting me.

Be quick. I don't wanna get fired tonight.


He was arrested
for assaulting his girlfriend.

Dr. Robey evaluated him at Bridgewater
and had him committed.


They were in there together
for three months in the same ward.


Daniel Marsh, we know you're in there!

Come out with your hands up!

[floorboards creaking]

All right, Daniel. Just write down
where you were on each of these days.

Just answer the question, Daniel.

Where were you
when these women were murdered?

I was going to school in Boston.
You know that.

What about Bridgewater?

You ever spend any time
with Albert DeSalvo?

Are you charging me?

Just answer the fucking question, Daniel.

If you are not charging me,
I want to leave.

You want to leave?

There's a dozen reporters out there
that just got tipped off. Go ahead.

If they put my name in the paper,
I'll just start over somewhere else.

[reporters clamoring]

[officer on phone] <i>Homicide.</i>

Uh, Detective Conley, please.

He's got to lay into him a little more.

It was pretty close.
[footsteps approaching]

Detective Conley,
your sister Sally's here.

Cashing in, huh?

Oh, why don't you save it? You've been
cashing in since the beginning.

Oh, that's pretty damn cynical,
even for you.

So, what do you want?

I just got back from Michigan.

I heard.

You don't care to know?

No, I don't.

I need DeSalvo's confession.

You gotta go see Bottomly for that.

I know you made a copy.

[Jim] How do you know that?
Oh, come on.

I bet you stayed up every night
listening to those tapes.

If we were right about DeSalvo,
what are you so afraid of?

Go home. Spend some time with your kids.

How do you just stop caring
after all this?

When you realize
you could give up your whole life for it,

and no one would give a shit.

Go home.

[bell rings]


[Bottomly on headphones]
<i>This is John Bottomly.</i>

<i>The date is February 14th, 1964.</i>

<i>Albert, please state your full name.</i>


tell me about your first victim.</i>

<i>How did you pick Anna Slesers?</i>


<i>There was a parking spot
in front of the house.</i>

<i>It makes you think about
what goes into this kind of selection.</i>

Like, why is this girl home
and that one's not?

What is it? Is it fate?

I'd like to ask you about her clothing.</i>

<i>Can you tell me what color robe
she was wearing?</i>

Aren't you on a new story?

Get over yourself. Let me listen.

what color robe was she wearing?</i>

<i>Yellow. Or maybe it was, uh, red.</i>




So, when you entered the apartment,
can you tell me what you saw?

Well, the kitchen was on the left.




[paper rustles on recording]

The kitchen was on the right,</i>

Bottomly just showed him
the crime scene photo.

Any lawyer worth a dime
would pick this apart.

I'm looking for Richard DeSalvo.


Look,
Al's not talkin' to reporters anymore.

Al's had it tough.

Whatever my brother did,
he never meant to harm nobody.

He loves his family,
always been good to them.

Look, I know there's more to his story.

But there's nothing I can do

I'll float it by him,

<i>Hi, Loretta. It's Albert.</i>

You know, my brother said
you come to see him.

I told him that I knew you

you girls knew more than the police.

Uh, why don't I come down there

The thing is, I'm not giving my story away

I got really screwed over
on that book deal.

<i>I listened to your confession, Albert,</i>

and, uh, I think
there's more to your story.

Well, like I said,
I'm not talking to reporters anymore.

Don't you want people to know the truth?

<i>I don't give a damn about that.</i>

I've got a family to support.

I don't think you understand
how screwed over I got.

Well, what are you holding out for,
Albert?

If everybody already screwed you over,
then what've you got left to lose?

<i>Why would you let them get away with it?</i>

Come here tomorrow at visiting hours.



[metal clanks]

[phone ringing]


Hello?

<i>Hey, it's Jack.
A report just came over the wire.</i>

<i>DeSalvo was killed in his cell.</i> [sighs]

<i>I'm sorry, kid.</i>

[birds squawking]


You get anything?


My guys at the <i>Herald</i> said
he got killed over drugs, but...

No, that doesn't make any sense.

[reporters clamoring]

He was in there with them.
He knew what they were up to.

[phone rings]

Hello.

I need you to take down an address.

If I don't call back in an hour,
give it to the police.

What the hell are you doing?

426 Columbia Road. Got it?

Got it.

Loretta...

Shit.

[doorbell buzzes]

[footsteps approaching]

I'm lookin' for Harrison.

He's down at the end of the hall.

[resident 1 coughing]

[resident 2 moaning]
[muffled thudding]


Yeah.

I-I'm a reporter with the <i>Record American</i>.

I want to ask you some questions
about Bridgewater.

Me and DeSalvo were in the same ward.
I saw him every day.

And what about... him?

Yeah. He was in my ward too.

They were always together.

Marsh and DeSalvo?

And Nassar.

George Nassar?

Yeah, the three of them were always
working on DeSalvo's confession.

W-What do you mean working on?

They coached him.
They were at it every day for weeks.

<i>They had a stack of newspaper clippings,</i>

<i>and they would quiz DeSalvo
about the details.</i>

<i>I remember Marsh sayin',</i>

<i>"You gotta get it so deep in your brain
that you believe it yourself."</i>

But what did they care
if DeSalvo confessed?

Reward money.
That's why Nassar got his lawyer involved.

I'm not shittin' you.

He's willing to confess
to the whole thing.

<i>His lawyer organized the whole thing.</i>

You mean F. Lee Bailey?

That's right.

He told Albert that he could get him
a book deal, make him rich and famous.

Albert thought he was gonna make
a million bucks off it

and support his family.

You got a smoke?

So, you wanna know about Albert.

How did you know each other?

We were cellmates.


Yeah, for a couple months.

It's an awfully strange coincidence,
don't you think?

You're the one
who gets picked out of the lineup,

and you just happen to be
DeSalvo's cellmate?

Maybe I just got one of those faces.

Were you in Sophie Clark's building
the day she was killed?

No.

I don't kill women.

And I got no reason to lie about that now.
I'm doin' a life sentence.


I wouldn't exactly call it that.

I was just helpin' him remember.

Thirteen murders,
that's a lot to keep straight.

Why were you helping him?

Reward money. Ten grand a victim.

So, the more murders he confessed to,
the more money you'd make?

Well, might as well take credit
for all of them.

Make a little extra money.

It was a lot of extra money.

And regardless of what you think,
Albert convinced me he killed those women.

Was it all 13?

What does it really matter?

See, you all created a myth,
and it needed to be stopped.

People wanted to believe it was Al,

but they needed to believe
that it was Albert.

The alternative was just too disturbin'.

What's that?

There are many Albert DeSalvos out there.

And your safe little world
is just a delusion.

Men kill women.

It didn't start with Albert.

Sure as hell doesn't end with him either.

about these killers having a type...</i>

The first five murders
were all elderly women.

<i>And if Paul Dempsey had a type...</i>
[shutter clicks]

It was elderly women.


<i>Everything he knew about the first five
murders had either been in the papers,</i>

<i>or it was given to him by Bottomly.</i>

<i>But of the hundreds of women
DeSalvo assaulted,</i>

all his victims were young.

<i>And then Paul Dempsey moves on
to New York,</i>

<i>and the Strangler starts killing
younger women.</i>

<i>Then other men use the Strangler as cover
to get rid of women</i>

<i>they didn't want around anymore.</i>

<i>The boss who got his secretary pregnant.</i>

<i>The psychotic ex-boyfriend.</i>

<i>Then DeSalvo ends up at Bridgewater
with Nassar and Marsh.</i>

<i>They use DeSalvo.</i>

<i>Nassar gets F. Lee Bailey involved
so he can claim the reward money.</i>

And they coached DeSalvo
before he confessed.

He just became a convenient way out
for everybody else.

<i>The entire city just wanted to move on.</i>

<i>Nobody bothered to get to the truth.</i>

[engine starts]

<i>And people got away with murder.</i>


Commissioner, Commissioner!

What is your response to the story
in the <i>Record American</i> today?

Commissioner, what is your response?

All the Strangler murders
are still open cases.

I'll leave it at that.

[reporters clamoring]


How many suspects do you have?
