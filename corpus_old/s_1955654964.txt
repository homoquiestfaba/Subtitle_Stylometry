STU: Dude, what's up
with your grandma?

ALEX: She's
all good.
Yeah, she is.

I just had
dinner with her.

You know, I remember
the first time

I dreamt about
your grandmother.

Honestly,
I can't deal
with that tonight.

Do you ever look
at your grandma

and be like, "Damn,
I got a hot grandma"?

Why do you like
my grandma so much?

Your grandma is hot.

Dude, you're
a sick bastard.

Well, that's
the first time I ever
seen a Botoxed ass.

There's not a wrinkle
in your grandmother's ass.

Why is it always
about my grandma?

Well, your grandma's
ass is tight, all
right? It's tight.

That's why I'll be
bangin' your grandma
to Color Me Badd.

* Ooh... *

Why you gotta
say that shit?
Why you gotta...

Let me ask you
a question, though.

What's up with
this car, though?

What's up
with the Silly Putty
and the rice cakes,

and how come I got
a chew toy up my ass?

Why do you have
a chew toy up your ass?

I don't know.
Why don't you...

Tell me, why are we
sitting here?

Why am I sitting
on crackers right now?

There's crackers
all up in this car.

Why you gotta say
"crackers" all the time?

I'm not talking about you
when I say "cracker."
Oh. Oh.

You know she went
to Mexico with him?

Did she tell you that?

That Astrid friend
of hers did.

See, that's who
you should be banging.
(CLICKS TONGUE SUGGESTIVELY)

Mmm-hmm.

You think she's
sleeping with him?

No!

Oh, come on, man!

You don't take
a girl to Mexico

unless you plan on
filling that taco
with some beef.

Dude, there's no way
he's doing all that spending
if he's hitting it steady.

Trust me,
he's still courting.
Wait, wait, wait.

Mexico?

New ride?

You find a good
parking spot,

you gotta keep
feeding that meter,

you know what I mean?

Oh, scanner's
clear, boys.

Everybody check
your guns.
Check.

'Cause my grandma
did the laundry.

What is the problem?

What, this isn't
scary? What?

You gotta be
kidding me.
What?

You gotta be
kidding me.

Try and tell me
it's not scary.

Just 'cause
yours is black, man.

STU: Why does it always
gotta be about color?



Oh!


(RESUMES SNORING)

ERIC: Hey, uh,
that a deviated septum?

What the...
What? Wait.

You can get that fixed,
you know.

Is this some kind
of sick joke?

You ever hear the one
about Little Johnny
and his left nut?

That's a sick joke.

(GRUNTING NERVOUSLY)

What do you guys want?

I think you know.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Oh...

Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

Oh, God, I just got
a whole lot of ass and sack.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

(MUTTERS CURIOUSLY)

(CELL PHONE RINGING DISTANTLY)


Yeah.
CARMEN: Alex, honey.

I told you not
to leave the front
door unlocked.

now's not really a good time.
Now, sweetheart,

don't forget tomorrow.
We have to be at
the track by noon.

We're all betting
on your horse.

I love you. Bye.

Wait, wait, it's dark,
it's dark.

Wait, like, like.

All right. All right,
all right, all right.
STU: Let's go.

Oh, God.

STU: So, what do you got
here? What, like, 3,800,
4,000 square feet?

Thirty... 3,950. Why?

Nothin'. I'm into
real estate.

Open the safe!

What are you doing?
Whoa!

STU: What are you doing?
Shoosh!

Don't you tell me
to shoosh.

I will shoosh you.
I will shoosh you.

He will shoosh you.
I need my glasses.

Just get your glasses.
Okay.

(KEYPAD BEEPING)

It's all yours. Just
take the... Hey!

FRANCIS:
Don't, don't shoot me.
Please, don't hurt me.

My daughter. She's here
for the weekend. And...

You should be a little
bit more careful with
who you do business with.

With whom.
What?

With whom.

What?

Dude, are you serious?

Prepositions.
Dangling.

What, you wanna talk
about punctuation now?

At least I'm not
appraising his house.

Oh, God, Mr. Preposition.

You know, you really
should be careful

with whom you do
business with.

Okay. Okay.

Don't.

STU: Go get
the yay-yo.

Go get it.

STU: Hmm.

(GUN COCKING)

Uh, Stu?

ERIC: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

When were you
gonna tell us
about this guy, huh?

Bruce, Bruce, Bruce!
Down. The gun,
the gun down. Down.

Look what I found, boys.

STU: Bruce?

See, I told you
this shit was scary.

Hey, hey.
No need to gag 'em.

Who they gonna call?

ALEX: Hey, fellas?

ERIC: Nothing came up
on the scanners?

No, nothin'.

Soiree, my ass.
Bitches, let's waytch!

Well, hello, Officer.

Getting a good look
at us with that
big flashlight?

It is big,
isn't it?
Hmm.

This party blows.
Let's go to Micky's.

Well, do something.


Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

Use your teeth.
Use your... Ay!

Oh, you're pulling
my hair, my hair,
my hair.

Oh, ow.
No, that's my skin!

That's... Ow!

(EXCLAIMING IN EXCITEMENT)

You were scared, right?
You were a little scared?
Oh, I was shittin'.

That guy put the gun
right to my...

See how brave I was?

You saw how brave I was.

I impressed
you, right?
Sho' 'nuff.

Oh, my God! What...

So how'd we do?

How'd we do?
How much we get, man?

I say we got about
15K each, guys.

Do you know
how much soap
you can buy

with 15 G's,
Eric? Huh?

Lots of soap!

My car wash
is starting to feel
like a mirage, man.

Dude, lay each brick
with purpose and
soon you have a castle.

That is from
the Zen master.

You know what
I'm talking about.

Hmm. I said mad money,
money, check money...

You know?
That guy looked me
dead in the eye.

Because you have
gorgeous eyes.

Yes. Yes!

Yes!

STU: You are never
gonna be in that
neighborhood again.

You will never see
that guy again
in your life.

Don't worry about it.

Oh, by the way. Alex.
Uh-huh.

I have a little
gift for you.
Oh, is this for me?

It's for you.
Oh, isn't that nice?

Hey, look, drop me off
at the track, okay?

It's in 5:00
in the morning.

Well, I gotta see
a man about a horse.

(HORSES NICKERING)

Hidden Asset.
35-to-1, huh?

Well, hello, gorgeous.

How are you doing today?

Huh?

Listen, I'm not one
much for small talk,

so I'm gonna cut
right to the chase.

Don't look at me
like that.

You gotta be
safe these days,
Hidden Asset.

All kinds of diseases
floating around.

You never know.

And I respect you.
That's why I'm being safe.

Here we go.

(WHINNYING
NERVOUSLY)

K-Y. Makes it
much easier on you.

Nice lubey-dube-dub.

All right, sweetheart.

This is gonna be
real quick,
and real painless.

Now, take a deep breath
and count to three.

Three!




You sexy bitch.

Never get you alone.

Thank you very much.

I want you
to check this out.

Badowshky.
Oh, that's it.

That's the good stuff,
right there.

There's four units.
It'd be all good.

And how are you
doing today?

I am quite fine.
How are you doing today?

Oh, good.
Yes, you are.

Actually, I'm thinking
about my boy.

Eric?
Yeah.

What about him?
I'm glad I'm not him.

KRISTEN: You know
what I think?

I think Eric is getting
what he deserves.

Because you can't
expect Tara

to just come running
back to him.

Why? Because now
all of a sudden
he wants to commit?

But, baby.
She's sleeping with
another man.

She jumped from
one man's bed to
the other, like that.

(SPEED-DIALING)


(CELL RINGING)

Come on, pick up.

Star 67? Come on, really?
Are you kidding, Eric?

Tara!

What do you want?
I'm a little busy.

You wanna get
some coffee?

I don't know if
that's a good idea.

What do you mean,
not a good idea?

Well, we're taking
a little break, remember?

It's just coffee.
How 'bout tea?

What's going on with you?

What's going on
is that you don't take
your life seriously

and you refuse
to grow up.

What,
I don't have a regular job
like your little lawyer buddy?

How about a regular job
like everyone else
on the planet?

Look, when you're
ready to start acting
like a real adult

and ready to be serious
about your life,

then maybe, you know,
we could...

Then maybe what?

Then maybe you'll let
the love back in the room?

And maybe you'll feel
all warm and fuzzy again?

Do you know what?
I don't need this.
I really don't.

(BEEPS OFF)

(PHONE BEEPING)

What?

Hey. I'm up
three hundy, man.

Why don't you come down
to the track?

I miss ya, man.
A little sunshine,

some action
on the ponies.

It'll get your mind off
Tara for a little while.

She's not on my mind.

Yeah, right.

CARMEN: Give me a brandy
and a light.

Look, I don't wanna
hear it, all right?

Is that Eric?
Yeah.

Is he still bitchin'
about that skinny-ass
girlfriend of his?

Eric? Listen, honey,
get over here.

You know that
I am all the woman
you'll ever need.

ERIC: I think
I hate her.

ALEX: I think I might
have cracked a rib.

Hey, Solly.
How's it goin'?

Look Eric,
women are evil.

It says so in the Bible.

And of course,
I can't bitch,

'cause she's convinced
herself I was the damn
Antichrist

for the last two years.

Yeah, well.
I gotta see a man
about a toilet, all right?

ERIC: So, it's our
first New Year's
together, right?

Uh-huh.

And we're at dinner.

She decides to order
the $20 swordfish,

the most expensive thing
on the menu

'cause, you know,
she doesn't eat meat
or chicken.

Right.

And then all she eats
is a quarter of the meal.

Literally, three bites.

And then at
the end of the meal,

that's when she decides
to open up to me, you know?

I think you're amazing.

I'm starting to have
real feelings for you.

And the whole time
I'm thinking,

"That swordfish is definitely
coming home," you know?

(BUGLE PLAYING FIRST CALL)

Oh!

(BELL DINGING)

RACE COMMENTATOR:
And they're off.

Give me your phone.
No.

Give me your phone.
Wash your hands.

Shit.

Alex, will you put
your damn pants on?

It's a winning
ticket here.

(SPEED-DIALING MANUALLY)

Come on. Come on!


Watch. Watch.

Yeah!

Yeah!

Come on, Eight!

Yeah!

Yeah!


Yeah! Reach out
and touch this, bitch!

Yeah!

Hello, baby.
Hey, baby.

Momma just hit
the big professor
and she is hot.

Come here.

Daddy got a hose
for Mommy's fire.

Maybe tri-fuck-ta.

Ooh!

Ah!

You are bad.

Ooh!

Hey. Show's over.

All right.

You know, Tara got me
this for Christmas.

That's all she got me.

And she got five
or six presents.
No shit.

You know
for Valentine's Day
she got me a journal?

She gave you a diary?

Yeah. What am I
gonna do with
a frickin' diary?

Write stuff in it.

Thanks.

One beer.
One Diet Coke.

Can I ask you a question?

When a girl breaks up
with a guy,

(HEAVENLY CHOIR SINGING)

is it true
she can remember

the exact moment
she lost that feeling?

Yeah. Totally.

How?

How is there
an exact moment?
There just is.

Women feel everything,
from the first kiss
to the last teardrop.

(HEAVENLY CHOIR SINGING)

For me, when I cried
the last time,

I knew something
changed.

In an instant.

Wow.

(HEAVENLY CHOIR SINGING)
You're so deep.

He now lives
with his mother.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

What are you
laughing at?

He lives with
his grandmother.

Oh.

Yeah, but I have
my own room.

It's... It's like
an apartment,
you know?

(COUNTRY ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh, my God!

Whoa!

Breasts are magical, man.
That's true.

I want you to go in here,
I want you to see bush.

Ladies.

Eight feet with the ball.
Forget height.

ERIC: All right, all
right, all right.

Hey, hold it, fellas.
Hold on a minute.

What's the matter
with you?

I said, hold on
a minute.

Dude. Your jock strap's
on a little tight, okay?

What'd you say to me?

I said, dude,
your jock strap's a...

Holy shit!

Dude, you just
got clocked!

ERIC: Oh, is that
all you got?

special for you.
Oh, oh, oh, ma'am.

My friend's a little
stressed out right now.

I don't care.
I don't give a shit.
All right.

ERIC: I'm gonna
knock you straight.
Come on. Oh, are you, huh?

Yeah. Yeah.
Well, I got something

for your little friend
here, too.

Well, what did I do?
I'm very innocent.

Yeah, bring it on,
bring it on.
Come on. Are you?

Get the hell
out of her.
Shut up!

Go on, get out of here,
you little pissant.

Hey, what's the matter
with you, huh?

All right,
so it looks like
they're not coming,

so this is for you.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Check this out.
I'm thinking about
getting married.

No!

I gotta do it.
You don't
have to do it.

I love her.
The fuck does that even
mean? It's a contract.

The only reason
why people married

is because people have
always gotten married.

It's a fuckin'
stupid idea.

I thought when
you get married,
it's for the...

If it didn't exist
and somebody
brought it right now,

someone came up
with the idea,

everyone would go,
"Are you fuckin' crazy?"

How you even...
What?

You have to go
file in court,
sign some papers,

and then when
you break up you gotta
hire a frickin' lawyer.

I mean, there's
a six-month
cool-down period.

Dawg, all I was trying
to tell you is that

I was thinking about
getting married.

And I'm telling you
it's a biological trick.

First of all, she'd
never do that to me
'cause we're best friends.

If she was really
your best friend,

she would let you
fuck other chicks.

(WOMAN CHATTERING OVER PA)

That is so huge.

Did you tell him yet?
Oh, no.

I didn't have a chance.

And, you know, I was
waiting and waiting

for a good time
to do it,

and he just rushed out
and I couldn't do it.

But I'm gonna do it.

The reason why you get
so caught up in a woman

is 'cause there's
crazy chemicals

that your brain
puts out

because you
wanna mate.

You wanna breed.
It's natural.

You've thought about
this a lot, I see.

Why do you think
it feels better
when you come inside?

'Cause that's
how you make
fuckin' babies, dude.

If it felt just
as good to jerk off
on a chick's back,

everybody would
be jerking off
on chicks' backs.

That's...
That's beautiful.

Listen, man.
Your girl's Latin.

You come in her hair,
she's getting pregnant.

Why do you think
there's so many
Puerto Ricans?

Wow, I don't know.
Puerto Rico's that big.

There's millions
of Puerto Ricans.

What's up?

Wow!

It's not like
he's afraid
of marriage.

I don't think
so. Right?

Well, honey,
when is a man
ever ready?

Oh, this is gonna
take our relationship
to a whole, whole...

Oh, my God,

to a whole new level.

What is he doing?

Well, I just hope
he's getting good advice
from his friends.

Oh, I hope so, too.
Uh-huh.

Shit.

When was the last time
you had diarrhea?
What?

When was the last time
you had diarrhea?

Dawg, I'm talking
about marriage.

I'm talking about
a beautiful thing.

I'm talking about
walking down the aisle...

So am I. So am...
That's just
the first day.

You don't
understand, man.

So, like you're sitting
on the toilet, right?
Uh-huh.

And you're grunting
and you're sweating and

all sorts of just
unspeakable shit is
pouring out of your body.

You're just
grunting and...

Your stomach's churning
and weird shit's going
on inside you.

And then finally,
the churning stops.

And there's
this calmness.

And for a moment
you get, like, this
little tickle.

And it feels good
for, like, a couple
of seconds.

That's marriage!

Dawg...

Ask any married guy.
Right.

Okay. Okay.
How's the wife
and kids, man?

She's all right, man.
She's cool.

But I got lucky.

I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

Ritchie!

Francis, what's
up, man?
I got robbed.

What?

Three guys
came in my house.

Two white guys

and a black guy.

And the black guy was gay.

God bless you.

Oh, this is
my friend, Stu.
Hey.

Francis.
Hey.

What's up?

So, I can't believe
somebody robbed you.
That's crazy.

He got robbed, dude.
By a gay black dude.
They took my money.

They knew
where my safe was.

I don't even know
any gay black dudes.
STU: No, you don't.

They knew everything.

RITCHIE: They must not
have known you, man.

Nobody who knows you
would ever mess with you.

I know you.

I don't know you.

You have beautiful eyes.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've been drinking.

I gotta see you later.

Come by the house.

Oh, shit!

Holy shit!

All right, this is it.
Don't touch the fence, man.

Unless you want
a permanent Afro.

I'm bald.
It'll grow.

This is it.
Check it out.

That's the warehouse.

Now, I don't know
exactly who they are
but, uh,

I'm guessing
low-rent gottis.

All right, so
we'll come back tonight
and case the spot.

No. No, no can do.

My wife would stretch
my ass all out.

You are such
a hypocrite.
Yeah.

You are such
a hypocrite.

Yeah, I got kids, bitch.
I'm not saying I'm happy.

Hey! Micky the Calc.

Hey, Big Frank.

How are the numbers?

The numbers could've
never been better, man.

Another two weeks,
you're gonna need
a bigger safe.


Hey.

Now, boss, uh,
about the thing
with the thing

with the new batch.

All right, already.
What about the new batch?

Well, there's nothing
wrong with it,

it's just I'm thinking
maybe we should hold off
with the big boys, is all.

Bruno, am I
hearing this right?

Carlo here is
telling me that I
gotta scale things down.

Is that what you think,
you little weasel?

We ought to scale
things down?

No disrespect.

It's just that the thing
with the new batch,

hitting the bigger casinos
takes us to another level,
right?

And you gotta think
about your arteries
and all.

Carlo, I am employ you
to think, not to worry.

We are going to
do things my way.

No more tiptoeing around!

You're the boss.
That's right.

You're the boss.
I'm the boss!

I'm the boss!
You're the boss!


Frank?

Hey, Bruno,
you wanna go eat?

Yeah, I can eat.
All right.

Oh, but I gotta go
meet my girl, Frank.

What? I gotta
meet my girl.

What's the matter
with you?
What?

All of a sudden
it's, "I gotta go
meet my girl" this,

"I gotta go meet
my girl" that.

What, she plays
a little flute,

and here comes Bruno
up out of the basket.

FRANK: Out of the basket.
(LAUGHING HUMORLESSLY)

All right. Let's eat.

(FLOOR CREAKING)

TARA: Yeah, I know.

(TARA GIGGLING)

Yeah, I know
you don't practice
that kind of law.

I'm just sayin'.

I mean, it just
seems to me that

if a stage animal
is gonna go berserk,

you know, every lawyer
in town's gonna be
chasing that ambulance.


Well, I mean,
there's gotta be
somebody to sue.

Not because
the animal's not liable,

but there's gotta be
somebody or some
insurance policy.

Well, my shows are
getting ready to come on,
so, I'd better go.

Okay. Bye.

(RHYTHMIC ELECTRONIC
MUSIC PLAYING)

(WOMAN MOANING ON TV)

WOMAN ON TV: (MOANING)
Oh, that's good.


Hi there, kitty.

What you doin'?

Oh, are you hungry?

Hmm?

Hungry? Come on,
let's go get you
something to eat.

(PORNO MUSIC
PLAYING DISTANTLY)

(WOMAN MOANING ON TV)

(VIBRATING SOUND)

(TARA MOANING)


You are the most
anal bastard
I have ever met.

Are you really
cleaning this engine
with a toothbrush?

And Tara's
gonna call you

now that you can
see yourself in
your engine?

Let me ask you
something.

What?

When a guy meets a girl,

what's the first thing
the guy's friends ask?

"Does she have
big tits?"

Exactly.

You know
the first question
the girl's friends ask?

Do you think
I have any concept of
what women talk about?

"What does he do?"
That's what they ask.

You saw Tara.

Not exactly.

Uh-huh.

I just hate how
what you do

is supposed to define
who you are, you know?

It's all bullshit.

I once told a girl
I was a professional
masseuse.

Masseur.

What'd you call me?

Nothin'. Whatever.

So, did she have you
working all night?

Oh, yeah.

Did you get any?

Did you get any
in the morning?

Oh, yeah,
of course, man.

Yeah, she woke up
and I just was like,

"Oh, you fell asleep
last night.

"I didn't do this."
And I just started
hitting it.

You're a liar!

You don't even
know the story!

You don't even
know the story!

Dawg, the last thing
you hit was your
left hand, man.

(ERIC LAUGHING)

So, what's
the big news?

Let me see your lucky
casino chip, man.

Badowshky.

This I like. That's
a new trick, Stu.

I got a few more
of these in the car
if you want.

I'm talking about
one last hit. All right?

You get your horse.

You get your car wash.
You get some therapy.

How so?

Ritchie found
a gold mine.

STU:
They are making casino chips
in a warehouse by the busload.

So there's security.

STU: They got
two guards.

All right? I got in and out
last night, no problem.

What if they're
counterfeit?

Listen to this...
They look identical to me.

And the casino
thought so, too.
Uh-huh.

Yeah.

The smell of money like
this makes my dick hard.

Save it for your horse.

Hey!

So what's up, Eric?

(EXHALES DEEPLY)
I don't know, man.

It's a little
off-road for us,
you know?

You know what?

I'll hold on to
that until you
can think straight.

Watch this.
I want you to watch
this carefully.

Yo, Alex.

Alex.
So, what's up?
I'm in.

All right, all right.

All-white-meat chicken,
no mayo, right?

Yeah, there's
your Atkins burrito,
tough guy.

So, uh, I got
the skinny on
Tara's new guy.

Is there a wallet?
Yeah.

This guy I know
says he knows his ex.

Dude, why are
you so obsessed
with his flow?

Dude, 'cause he's
a lawyer. He's got flow.
So, what's his deal?

Well, he's got
a chronic breath problem.

This kind of weird
lactose thing.
And he's got a cat.

What kind of guy
has a cat?

The only thing, though.

Apparently, they say
he's got a really...

A really big dick.

That's TMI.

Dude, that's not cool.

It's not cool that
he's got a giant cock?

No. That's not cool.

Can't you let a man
have a giant cock?

Is it, like,
burrito big?

Like, if this
was his dick,

he must have just
gotten out of the pool.

Right?

Dude, it's totally
the money. Don't
let him fuck with you.

No, it's...
It's definitely
the money.


ALEX: All right, Eric, jeez!

ALEX: Let me
get a nutty cup.

STU: Get out of here.
ALEX: Give me a nutty cup.

STU: No way.
How many you
gonna eat?

Shut up!

You ever think
that maybe this
guy ain't got shit?

What are you
talking about?

Like, what if he
maxed out all his
credit cards out

just so he could
get in her pants?

'Cause at the end
of the day, what
does she got?

Nice stuff.

I mean, granted,
it's really, really
nice stuff.

Real nice stuff.

She's got, like,
she's got some
nice stuff, you know?

Nice.
Oh, but,
he bought her.

She's a stone
in your shoe.

You need to make her
a stone in your path.

ALEX: Hmm,
the Zen master say...

(TALKING GIBBERISH)

You can... You can totally
knock it if you want to,

you know, but you
get what you resist.

Quit trying to make
everything perfect again.

And see what happens,
dude. You get what you
resist. It's true.

It's true.
All right,
all right.

I'll be sure to get
the bumper sticker.

Wow, dude.

MAN ON RADIO:
When your lover shuts you out,

give them their space.

Like a deer in
an open prairie,

they need their time
away from the herd.

The most important
thing to remember

is give them
their time and space.

(TURNS RADIO OFF)

TARA: (GIGGLES) Okay.

So where
are we going to eat?

BRUNO: Uh, I found
this new place.

But it's a surprise.
So I'll be there in a few.
(PHONE BEEPING)

Sounds good
to me.
(SPEED-DIALING)


Oh, hold on
a second, it's...

(PHONE BEEPS)

Hello?
ERIC: Hey, baby.

(FEEDBACK WHINING)

What the hell
was that?
Uh, nothing.

Uh, listen.

I'm in neighborhood.
I was just thinking
I could drop by.

No, no, no! Listen, um, that's
my mother on the other line.

Let me call you right back.
No, no, no. It's okay.

I'm just around the corner.
I'll be there in a few.

(SIGHS HEAVILY)

Hi, baby. Listen, um,

that was my mom.
Sorry about that.

And my apartment
is an absolute wreck.

Um, is there any way
maybe we could just
meet at your place?

BRUNO: This is about
what's-his-name, isn't it?

Now, I know you're
highly creative, honey,

but don't go dreaming up
scenarios in your head.

BRUNO: Oh, let me
get this straight.

You want me to turn around,
go back to my house and
wait for you?

Yep. That's exactly
what I want you to do.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Oh, shit.

But I'm... I'm three
minutes from your place.

Hey, baby.
Hi!

Can I come in?

Actually, you know
what? No. I was just
gonna run out.

Uh-huh. You want
some company?

No, no. I'm just gonna
go run some errands.

Hmm.
Yeah.

Place looks nice.
Pretty tidy.

Yeah. Finally picked up
some of your good habits.

Where are my keys?

You sure you don't
want company?

Found 'em. Yeah.
You know what?

Excuse me.
Excuse me.

Um, I'm just,
you know, gonna go
run some errands,

just girl stuff, so.

But maybe we could
meet up later.

Huh.
Okay.

What, you're seeing
what's-his-name today?

No, baby. Some of
us actually work
during the day.

(EXHALES DEEPLY)
But I got you
a little something.

Oh! How sweet.
Thank you.

Okay.

She wants to
come back to me.

I could see it
in her eyes.

What you saw
in her eyes was fear.

And that is
usually followed by
a restraining order.

Okay, listen to me.
I got this little trick.

Whenever me
and Kristen go at it,

I'll stop in
mid-fight and
I'll grab a hold of her,

and I'll hold her quietly
until she's calm,

and I'll be like,
"Shh, shh, baby. Shh."

And almost always,
that'll stop the fight.

I got it from this
old Barry White song.

Hold your baby close
until the lovemaking
starts.

(PHONE RINGING)

Shut up. Shut up!

Please. Please?

Hey, baby.

Hey. Do you
have a second?

You know what? No.
I got... I got, like,
you know,

I don't even... I don't have
a minute right now, 'cause of,

you know, we...
We doing what we do.

Okay, just... Just one second,
Stu, please. It's really
important.

Okay, well, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

'Cause it's the bottom of
the ninth and, you know, we...

Uh-oh! Home...
Ah, home run!

I'm gonna have
to call you back.

Yeah. I guess.

Oh, look who's here.
Stuart. Please, join
us for our robbery.

Shut up,
Mr. Freakin' Disco Van.
All right?

Honestly,
this disco ball is hot.
The disco ball is hot?

ALEX: You didn't even
know I'd come through
with a car with a disco ball.

What kind of shit is this,
man? You got a disco ball.

You got Yahweh
hanging on the wall.

Does it get funner
than this, boys? Huh?

More fun.

Sorry.

ERIC: It's not a word.

All right.
Let's do this.

ERIC: All right,
Alex. No screw-ups,
all right?

Hey.

Every two minutes,
one's across the screen,

everything's cool,
all right?

Two's, we
hit the deck.

Three's, we bail.
I got it. I know
this shit.

That's all right.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, Stu.

Be very careful.
That is an electric fence,

if you do not
notice. Hold this.

You guys are very
lucky you have
a professional like me

taking care of
this situation.

I learned all
about this shit
in junior college.

It's all about
the currents.

Ooh, see?
Scary.

You wanna make sure
you got the positive
with the positive,

and the negative
with the negative

or you don't know
what the hell's
gonna happen.

Yeah, my man Pedro
told me the whole
story about some guy

doing some
shit like that.
He died!

And that's why
I did my homework
before I came here,

to make sure that
everything went smoothly.

Oh, God!
Oh, God!

Nah, I'm messing with
you guys. It's cool.

Well, that shit
ain't funny.
All right, all right.

ALEX: Good luck, boys.

Yeah? (CHUCKLES)

What are you wearing?

Oh, that's some...
Hey, Bruno!

Jeez, Carmine.

Ah, you scared
the shit out of me, man.

Come on, I could have
blown your brains out.

Now, get back
to your post.

Shit.

Baby? I...

I know. I'm...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I will never... I...

I would never
put you on hold.

(OWL HOOTING)

(METAL CLANGING)

Yeah.

(COYOTE HOWLING)

(OWL HOOTING)

You want a piece of me?
Huh? Come and get it.

(OWL HOOTING)

(BIRD SQUAWKING)


This is it?
Of course it is.

(IMITATING HEAVENLY
CHOIR SINGING)

Oh, my God.

You need a little
carwash money?

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
What time is it?
Oh, shit.

(CELL BEEPING)

Hold on, hold on.

Shit.
Who is it?

It's Tara.
Don't answer it.

Don't answer it. Don't...
Don't you dare.

And don't you even.
Don't.
Excuse me.

(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah.

(SITAR MUSIC PLAYING)

What do you
mean, "Yeah"?

I can't talk.
I'll call you later.

I'm sorry,
it's... What?

What do you mean,
you can't talk?
I'm trying...

Okay.


That's probably the best
thing you've ever done for
your relationship, man.

You have officially
become my hero.


(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

We're good.

Your bag, sir.
Thank you, sir.


She can leave a message.
She can leave a message.

All right. Done.

Ah. Feels good,
don't it?

Oh, 'cause you're
in front of your friends,
you're not gonna answer.

Huh, Mr. Big Guy?
Mmm-hmm.

Okay. Play games?
Play. That's fine.

You know what
that is sagging
between your legs?

Your nuts. You
just became a man.

They've dropped.


(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

Holy shit!

You know what?
Now might be
a good time to go!

You think?

ERIC: God, did you
see that safe?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on.

(ENGINE STARTING)

Hey, Bruno, I got 'em.

All right, I'm coming around.

ERIC: Shit!

STU: Split up!

STU: Oh, man.
Kristen's gonna freak.

Tara's gonna flip.

Jeez!

Carmine, not too fast.
Not too fast. I got
a date tonight, all right?

This is gonna be great!

BRUNO: Carmine? Easy!

Just brace yourself!

Jeez!

Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!



Hey!


Oh, shit!

Come on. Come on.
Pick up.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

(HORSE NEIGHING)

Hey, girls. You were
beautiful last night.

Let's see how well
you play today, huh?

So, we don't know
where Bruno is.

Oh, no, we checked.
But, uh, nothing yet.

But he's not with
that new girlfriend?

Uh, don't know.

FRANK: And do we know who
these, uh, these punks are
and who they're working for?

Well, not yet.
But we got
a cell phone.

A cell phone?
What does that matter?

Hi.
Hello, baby.

What about my safe?

The safe?
It's good. I checked.

Did you take care
of the thing
with that guy?

What, the thing,
with the thing?

I took care of that.

Well, of course he's,
you know, doing a little
thing with the thing.

Good. (CHUCKLES)
Good. Good.

Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

So, this guy, he's shooting
lookout for his buddies
and they get away.

But, all they got
was 100 grand's worth.

Hey, don't say
it like that.

Used to be 100 grand
was 100 grand.

Yeah, well.

There is one
other thing, boss.

Yeah, take it.
Spit it out.

It has to do, uh,
concerning with Bruno.

What about Bruno?

Well, last week's
numbers?

They were off
a few grand.

You know, you got Bruno
and you got the new
girlfriend, and Bruno,

and you got
the new girlfriend,

and Bruno with
the new, you know,

with the girlfriend, he's
thinking of buying...

All right!

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

Where is this lookout?
Bring him out.

Fellas. Let's go.

Kid.

You better start talking,
and talking fast.

Right. Fast, right now.

Not getting
nothin' out of me.

I have an idea.

Uh, why don't
I start by getting
your spleen out of you?

Now you tell me
who you're with.

Ooh. Ooh!

Pretty Boy!

(MOCKING SOFTLY)
Pretty Boy!

Good for you!
Shit!

Oh, God!

All right!

I was with my friends,
Stu and Eric.

Who the hell
are Stu and Eric?

Known 'em since
Mrs. Pomerantz's
eighth-grade biology class.

You're kiddin' me,
right?



Hey? That's
what you get.

You know what?

You're right.

Miss Pinsky
taught biology.

Pomerantz taught
social studies.

My bad.
I got confused.

(STAMMERS SPEECHLESSLY)

(PHONE RINGING)

Alex, what the hell?
What the hell?

FRANK: Who is this?

Who's this?

This is the proprietor
of the establishment that
you ripped off last night!

What are you
talking about?

What am I talking about?

Oh!

ALEX: (MOCKING)
Hold me, honey. (MOANS)

It is all fun and
games, isn't it?

Until someone
gets fitted for
a new glass eye!

They got Alex.

Uh, well, uh, before
I kill your buddy here,

I would just like
to know a few things.


Ow!

You know what?
Okay.

Hey. Hey. Hey.
How're you doin'?

Ah!

BRUNO: Ah!

That's right!

BRUNO: You guys
are screwed.

You are so screwed.
Do you have any idea
who I am?

Oh, my God.
They got Bruno!

Hit him.

STU: Hit him.

Hit him again!

Oh! (LAUGHS)
Oh!

That's my shoe!

That's twice!
That's twice you hit him!
Hit him again! Hit him!

Ooh! Oh!
STU: Wait a minute.

Hold on.
No. No, you hold on!

Hold on.

Bruno.

Bruno, that
skimming bastard.

I ought to let him rot.
But his mother would kill me.

You gotta breathe,
Frank, please.

We all want you
to stick around
a little while.

Breathe.
I am gonna
smack you.

I'm on hold.

Well, you could always
put 'em to work.

What do you mean?

Well, they stole the chips
from the Palms batch. Right?

Right. So, they cash 'em in.
Call it a trial run.

Hello?

I'm still holding.

The Palms, yes.
They have serious
security there.

Okay!

I want some answers.

For starters, I wanna know
who you are and how you found
out about my warehouse.

Who we are
is inconsequential.

Inconsequential.
You listen to me,
you college prick!

All right.

What does
that prove?

I can't believe this.
I've got a college degree!

Who doesn't?




You want me to shoot him?
Right here? Right now?

Hold on.

Nobody needs to
get shot, all right?

Nobody needs
to get shot.

Just calm down!

Nobody comes to
rip Frank Santino off

who doesn't go away
with something broken.

Frank, Frank, stress.

It's the silent killer.
I gotta break
somebody's head.

I am gonna break
somebody's head!

Please. Take it easy.
Please, Franco.

Frank Santino.

That's right,
you little bitches!

Frank Santino.
You little bitches!

Breathe.

Mr. Santino.

All right.
Now you listen to me.

Here's what you're gonna do.

I want you to cash
in the 100 grand

that you stole from me!

I'm sorry, what?

I want you to meet me
at the, uh, Roadside Diner

the day after tomorrow
at noon.

And bring the cash.
You got it?



ALEX: Oh, God!


Don't screw it up.

(CELL RINGING)

I need a moment.

I need a moment.
I need a moment.
I need a moment.

You think maybe
I could use the phone?

Call my girl?

Thanks to you assholes,
I missed a date with her.

Now I gotta lie to
her about why I didn't
show last night.

Then I gotta put up
with her grillin' me.

Just tell her you
were in a car accident.
You got the bruises.

Yeah, I was thinking
car accident, too.

STU: Right.

Go for the sympathy.
STU: Right.

Maybe then she'll stop
riding me about another
big night out.

She's one of those.

Of course she's
one of those.
What do you think?

Why, you got
a ball-buster, too?

STU: Uh-huh.
That's, uh...

STU: Uh-huh.

...putting it mildly.

STU: Of course
I love you!
Man.

What guy hasn't
had his life ruined
by some girl?

Answer me that.

Baby, this is
some bull... I...

I can't understand you
when you speak that
Spanish shit to me!

You guys like
the ponies, huh?

Does the word
"shallow grave" mean
something to you?

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah? Yeah?
I understand
all that.

You understand that?
Yeah.

Hey, you got a racing
card over there?

Yeah, why?

Yeah, why?

You got a horse there
named Hidden Assets
racing?

Hidden Assets?
Yeah.

What about him?

Yeah. He's racing out
of Gate 6 in the 11th.

You got a bookie?

You think I might
have a bookie?

I had a thing.

You got a thing?
I got a thing.

He's got a thing!

Hello?

I gotta leave.

Kristen.

BRUNO: Pussy.

All right.

If you gotta go.

I gotta go.

All right.
Hey, don't forget.
We gotta move him.

I know. I know. I know.

All right.

What's up with
the Pringles?

These?
Alex bought 'em.

For what?

Storage.

Right, right.

One second, man.

Don't do it.

Don't do it.
Just don't do it.

Yeah.

"Yeah"? Is that how
you answer your phone?

What do you want?

What do I want?

I... Is that how
you talk to me now?

Can I help you
with something?

What's the matter?
You busy?

I need to see you.

I locked myself out
of my apartment.

Um...

So, can you come now?

Okay.

Good.

(CLEARING THROAT)
Tell me you're
not meeting her.

It sounded
urgent, man.


When isn't it urgent?

I'm just gonna go
see her for a few
minutes, all right?

No big deal.

You watch him
while I'm gone.

I'll watch him when
you go see Kristen.


Fuck that. Call her back
and tell her you'll meet
her on your terms, man.

You got the power.

I still got the power.
You got the power?

I got an idea
for cashing out.

(SPEED-DIALING)

SHECKY: Whoo-hoo! (CHUCKLES)
Who's your granddaddy?
(MUSIC PLAYING)

(PHONE RINGING)
Whoo-hoo!

CARMEN: Yeah!
Oh, hold on, hon.

SHECKY: Don't stop...
Don't answer.

No!

SHECKY: No.

Oh, this better be good.

I'll be with you
in a minute, honey.

Yeah. Hello.
Carmen, it's Eric.

(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Bad timing.

I need your help.
Yeah.

Okay, girls, remember.

We play a couple of hands
and then we cash out.


Stay out of
the men's room.

No racing.

What's the matter?
Lawyer wasn't available?

No, as a matter
of fact, he was not.

But I got in anyway.

Come in.

Take your shirt off.

What is up with
you? Wait. Wait!

Don't you think
we should talk?
Uh, no.

Uh.

(BELL RINGING)
RACE COMMENTATOR:
And away they go!

Do it.
Now?

Yeah, do it.



Move it!

Make your move!
Show me them assets.
Show me them assets, baby!

Come on!
Move it! Yeah!


Move it!

Go!

Move it, you bastard!

Ah!

RACE COMMENTATOR:
...Holland finishing third,

and they're followed by
Stowmeyer, Sweet Baby,

Tinseltown and Lovely Dowdy,
and way in the back,

bringing up the rear,
is Hidden Asset.

(GASPS IN DISBELIEF)

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

You guys want some
action on the next race?

Thanks, it's been...
It's been a stressful day.

Tell me about it.

Tara?
We need to talk.

Yeah, maybe later.

You know what?
I gotta get goin'.

Wait!

What are you doing?

Yeah. Okay.
I really do gotta
get going.

Okay. Thanks.
That was fun. Fun!

Fun.


Honey?

Hey, honey!

Yeah?

Hey, come here.
Do me a favor?

Drop that off at
the cleaners for me.

Thanks.

Sure.

The mosquito has
47 teeth. Truth or fib?

Fib.
No, that's
actually true.

A mosquito doesn't
have any teeth.

But when it bites you,
it has to pierce the skin.
It's not like a...

That was quick.
Yeah.

Your turn.

Babe, what's up?

What's up?
What's up?

I don't have
a lot of time.
What's up?

You don't have
a lot of time, Stuart?

Make some time!


Hey, these are baby names!

Hey, um,

I'm sorry about
that, you know.

Nah, don't worry
about it. All right?

I know you guys are
in a bit of a bind here.

It's clear you've
never done anything
like this before.

Yeah.
And you know what?

You didn't enjoy
hitting me when
you could have.

And you know what else?

I got a lot of respect
for the two of you

for sticking together
and waiting to make this
exchange to get your boy out.

That's a big deal.

You know, I ain't got
anybody like that in my life.

Real friends.

You know what?
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

When you guys go
in there to make this
deal with my uncle,

don't wear the pink dress.

Hey! If he senses
the tiniest little bit
of fear out of you,

you guys ain't gonna
see your buddy again.

I'm not shitting you.
Oh, man.

You gotta think about

the most pissed-off
your girl ever made you.

No. Think about
walking in on her

(PUNCHING HIS HAND)

banging this new guy.

You think about that,
and you go in there

and you put on
the biggest tough-guy
act you can.

Okay.
Let me see your
tough-guy face.

What?

Your tough-guy face.

All right. Uh...


No, like this.

Oh, okay.

Okay, now give me
a grunt with it.

Okay.


(INHALING NOISILY)

What, are you trying
to scare a bunch
of Girl Scouts?

Come on!

Watch and learn.


Oh, that's good.

Now do it.
Okay, okay. Um...


That's good.
It's a little pussy,
but I like it.

All right.

(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
How are you feeling?

I'm so good right now.
I'm so good.

Are you sure?
Yes.

Tell me
it's gonna be okay.

It's gonna be okay.

You don't have to...
It's gonna be okay.

It's gonna be okay.

Uh-huh.

Mmm.

I love you.
I love you, too.

(FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING)
SHECKY: Yeah!

(ALL CHEERING)
Oh! Whoa! Whoo!

Oh!
Ah!


Give me a hard eight!

A little Viagra, too.

And some K-Y.

Come on, baby.
Mama needs new shoes.

(ALL CHEERING)

Whoo-hoo!

Whoo!

(PHONE RINGING)
Oh.

Hello?

Carmen, what's going on?
You were supposed to call me
an hour ago.

Oh, Eric.

Darling,
is that you?

Oh, uh,
I can hardly
hear you, honey.

How is our little operation
coming along?

Oh! Fan-friggin'-tastic.

I just hit eight
the hard way

and I'm doubling up
behind the line.

No, no, no, no!
You're gambling?

Oh, listen, Eric,
I gotta go.

I'll have a friend
bring you the cash
in the morning.

Wait, what?

I'll hit ya later,
okay, sweetheart?
Bye.

No! Carmen?

Okay. Kiss 'em, baby.

(KISSING NOISES)

You wanna
get out of here?

No, no, there's
a huge difference between
courtship and relationship.

Yeah.

When you're courting,
she's the only thing
you can think about. Right?

Uh-huh.
I mean, you jump
through any hoop,

you blow off
your friends,

you pretend to like stuff
that you would never like.
Opera, poetry, flowers

and French
and shit like that.

Yeah, I know.

But when you start
getting it steady,

then all of a sudden
something snaps

and you don't want it
at all anymore.

She's trying to get
all frisky on you,

and you'd rather be
watching some
college basketball game

between two schools
you ain't even
heard of before.

Yeah. That's true.
So, what school
do you guys go to?

School?

Yeah. Listen,
we're not interested,
you little trollops.

(CLEARING THROAT)

Ooh. The one behind them
is checking you out, though.

Hey, let me
ask you something.

Hmm?

What do you tell a girl
when she asks you what you do?

I mix it up.
As long as it
sounds professional.

Yeah.

Hmm. She is
checking you out.

she's... Here she
comes. She's comin'.

(CLEARS
THROAT)
Hi.

Hello.
I'm Angie.

Hello, Angie. I'm Bruno.
This is Eric.

Hi.

Uh, Angie, would you
like to, uh, sit down?

No. I'm okay.

The diary.
You write in it?

The racetrack.

You look different.

Thanks.

So, um, how'd you guys
do that day?

Well, my buddy
hit a long shot
named Hidden Asset.

You bet on that horse?

Yeah, why?

That was
our first win.

Are you a gambler?

She's one of
my father's horses.

Oh. Daddy has horses.

So, what do you do?

Oh, uh, uh, my man here is
a professional, uh...

Masseur.

I'm a professional
masseur.

Masseur.

Let me see
those hands.

Really?

Really?

Really.

So, uh, did you ever
write in that diary?

Not yet.

You will.
You just need
to be inspired.

BRUNO: Speaking
of inspiration,

I'll just leave
you guys here.

Okay.

So, Eric.

Well, consider this
a hall pass!





(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Just give me
two minutes to explain.

What the hell
is that?

God!

That's part of it.


Jesus. Shut the door.

(GROANING IN PAIN)

How do you feel
right now?

I feel good.

I mean, do you feel
any guilt about
what just happened?

No.

I feel good.

Remember this feeling.

You're that much closer
to being over her.

It's funny.

Guys only begin to feel
when it's over.

We were in a fight

and I called him
an asshole.

He had this look
on his face

like I'd just
complimented him.

He thought he was
a cool asshole,
you know?

Something just changed
right there.

That feeling
just left me.

I guess you have
to be careful
who you fall in love with.

"With whom"
you fall in love.

TARA: Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

(TARA MOANING)

TARA: Oh, baby.
(MAN GROANING)

Oh. Uh-huh.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)


(BRUNO SNORING)

(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

Yes?

You Eric Pernalis?

Maybe.

Um...

I'm sorry to disturb you.

It's not what you think.
Anyway,

it's just a guy I know.
I mean, a friend.

It's okay.

Does this belong to you?

Looks familiar.

Carmen sent this
for you.

Will one of you guys
say somethin'
or turn the radio on

or somethin'? Jeez.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

You're gonna have to
go in there without me, man.

No, man, we
shoot for it.

Not this time.

Wanna tell me
what's going on?

She's pregnant.


What are you
gonna do?

Find a name.

Hey. You got
anyone in mind
for a godfather?


STU: Nice, dawg.
(ALL CHUCKLING)

Remember.

As if
she was banging him
right in front of you.

STU: Good luck.

Thanks.

Where's he going?

He's going to
the bathroom.

It can't be.

Maybe he's going to
crap his pants. (LAUGHS)

Oh, man!

Shit.


I can do this.

Ah!
Oh! The tough guy.

Dude... (GRUNTS)

I'm gonna make you squirm,
you little shit.

Hey. Hey, about
the other day, okay,
it was just that...

What are you doing?
Because of you, I got fired.

Consider this severance.

Just take what you
want and go, okay?

Tough guy like you,
you got me a little curious.

What'd you do,
piss yourself?


It is you, isn't it?

Don't you say a word.
Don't say a word!

Do you know who I am?
Come here.

I've been searching
far and wide for you.

I'm the guy
you ripped off.

I'm the guy
you tied up

and left
with a bag of coke
on his crotch.

Now you remember me?

I'm not really good
with faces or names.

That's all right,
brother!

That's all right.
Listen to me.

Listen to me!
I just wanted to walk here
and tell you something.

I wanted to come
right up to you

and I wanted to thank you.
Thank you,

to you and your buddies,

for changing my life.

Praise the Lord.

Now, sit down.
You gotta understand.

I was a no-good
sinnin' son of a gun!

Can you imagine,
all that cocaine,
all that cash,

all them guns in a house
with my little girl?

Dear Lord. Let us pray.

Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.
Say it.

Say it.
Praise the Lord.

Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.

BOTH: Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.

Praise the Lord!
Oh, happy day.
ERIC: Oh, happy day.

Stand up.

All right.
Listen to me.

If there's anything,
anything, you ever need,

you just look me up.

I'm your Brother Francis.


Well, you know, Francis,
there is this one thing.

Oh, don't even tell me.
They got Tony Bennett.
Boss, look at this.

You got a quarter?

Sit down, kid.

Okay.

Check him.

What, you piss yourself?

That's disgusting.
Right.

Well. I'm gonna give you
points for bravery.

So. Did you cash out
those chips?

Yes.

Good.


Ow! What's
your problem?
I'm not gonna hurt you.


Forgive me, Lord.
Ooh.

(INDISTINCT COMMOTION)
Hey!

The business is here.




What's wrong with you here?
What, you got a hemorrhoid
or somethin'?

Hey. Snap out of it.

Hey. I asked you a question.

Who the hell are you
working with?

Hey. Are we here
to make a trade
or exchange business cards?

Would you listen
to this guy?

You know who the hell
you're talking to, pal?

I got an idea.

Listen to me.

Your associate, your buddy,
he is as good as dead

if I don't get
some answers.

And I don't give a shit
about the money or that
fat nephew of mine.

Found itself into
a very strange place.

But it's always a pleasure
to do the work of the Lord.

Who the hell
are you?

Brother,
I am a fisher of men.

Really. Well, why don't
you go fish, then?

Somewhere else!

(NECK CRACKING)

Come on,
you heard him.

Hey. You know what?
That's it.

Do you wanna
make this trade
or not?

Not before
I get some answers!

No? Okay.

Hey, hey, hey!

It's a phone.
I'll get it.

It's a phone.


You a big shot?
Mmm?

Big tough guy?

Who are you
calling, huh?

What, your backup?
You calling the troops?

(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?

It's me. No deal.

Kill him.

Are you out of your
cotton-pickin' mind?

What? What'd he say?

I'm supposed to kill you.

Gentlemen,
I'm sorry we couldn't come
to another arrangement.

You weren't dismissed.

Okay, De Niro,
I get the point.

You wanna make a trade.

One hour.
Nice, safe place.

Right in front
of the police station.


Kid, you got a real pair,
I'll say that.
Thanks.

They just dropped
recently.

Well, that's beautiful,
but we're doing it here.

And we're doing it
right now.

All right, let's go.

Come on,
let's go, let's go.

You got two minutes.
Bring your car around back.

Talk about
full circle.

Let's try to make it
look real, huh?

Yeah. You leave me
in there long enough,
I don't have to try nothin'.


Hey.

In case I don't
see you again.


It was fun. Sorry.

Oh. Don't forget.
Tuesday.

All right.

What happens Tuesday?

You drive.

All right.
Good luck, man.

All right.

I got your back.
Okay.

What, you got him
in the trunk?

You didn't think
he was gonna ride
shotgun now, did ya?

Where's my nephew?

Take a guess.


You wanna trade cars?

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

Okay, let me
see him.

(PHONE RINGING)

Oh, yeah.

Hey, Bruno.

How the hell
did you get him in there?

Come on,
I'll show you.
Open it up.

Hola. What are you doing?

Now is really
not a good time, okay?

I was just starting to get
a tad claustrophobic.

Shut up!

All right?

All right.
Let's do this.

So, you know what?
I'm here,

waiting for you
for the picnic.
You forgot?

Baby? (SIGHS)

Where's the money?

In the car.
Well, go get it.


Yeah, it's me,
it's Alex, it's Eric...

What's up? What's up?

I got you.
We good.

Yeah, it's me,
Alex, Eric and, uh...

Show me the cash.

What's happening?

We at... No, we
at the ball game.

Yeah, they doing their thing.
They, you know...

All right.

Give it to me.

All right.
Uh, let's get these guys
some air, all right?

BEDEE: You little wuss!

What you always getting
your friends to do
your fighting for you?

Hey, what is this,
Dykes Gone Wild
or what?

Hey!
Hey!

I don't know what business
you got with this guy,

but we're in the middle
of something here
and it's invitation only.

Well, my business
is kicking his ass.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

So, look... Baby?

CARLO: What's the
matter with you?

I'll call you back.
All right? I don't wanna
hang up on you.

FRANK: That's a big momma.

Take their
handcuffs off him.


I think I wanna go
very Latin, very Spanish.

What about Fernando
or Anivo or Manuel?

I like Fernando.
Fernando's cool.

But could we go
with a more traditional
name, like LeBron?

No.

No? Then I get
the middle name.

And I want
"Mutombo."

Hector Mutombo,
how 'bout that?

He ain't gonna
be a basketball player.
I told you that.

Baby, I gotta go.
I gotta... I love you.

I gotta go.
I gotta go. I...

You look good
with a nice, uh,
shiner on you.

You like that?
Yeah, it's sexy.

Any of you guys
hungry?

Bruno is back.

First we gotta take care
of those guys.

What do
you mean, Frank?

Remember,
uh, cousin Sambini?

CARLO: Cousin Sambini.

All 142
pieces of him.


Uh, Carlo.
Let me use your phone.
I gotta call my girl.

Huh?
Come on.
I gotta call my girl.

Well, make it quick.

Don't stay on there
all day.

Got those
rollover minutes.

You see that one,
the sister?
The Brazos on her?

Did you see that?

(PHONE BEEPING)

You son
of a bitch!

ERIC: Screw you.
You started
this whole thing.

You did, you
scrawny little shit!

You butch freak!

What's your problem?
I'm not gay!

You're not gay?

No, I'm not.

Well, you're still
an asshole!

Get off me! (GRUNTS)


God damn it!
BEDEE: You jerk!

Ah!
(METAL CLANGING)

Oh, whoa, whoa.
Hey!

Wait a second!

Somebody wanna
translate this
for me, please?


We got about
a minute and 15!

Fourteen!

No. Oh, no.
Oh, no.

Whoa!
There's a bomb
in the car!

Bomb is bad!



(ALL SCREAMING)
Dude! Let me
out of here, buddy!

(ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

Come on, man.

I'm working on it!
Shut up!

Uh, Eric, I gotta admit
something, man.

What?

I masturbated to Tara.

A lot.

That's gross!
I'm sorry, dude!

That's gross!
I'm sorry!

Alex, I could
kiss you right now.

BEDEE: You guys are freaks!
Get me out of here!

Miss? Miss?

What is it?

Reach into my pants...
Well, screw you!

...and pull out
my pocketknife!

My pocketknife.
Get it! Get it! Get it!
Oh.

ALEX: Stu, come on!
Come on, buddy. Come on.

God, I can't die
in a Cadillac!

Come on!
Hurry!

Ooh. That's nice.
Yeah, thanks.
Come on. Let's go.


Come on!

ERIC: Merry
freakin' Christmas.

Open the damn trunk!

ALEX: Get it open!
Get it open, man!

Hell, yeah!

Come on.

My legs are so asleep.
Hold on, hold on.

Oh, God,
with the weird
pins and needles thing.

BEDEE: Come on.
That doesn't matter.

STU: Get your ass
out the car!
Give me the keys!

(BOTH GRUNT)

Ow.

ERIC: Come on, Stu!
Go! Go! Go!
BEDEE: Go!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Oh, my God.
Okay!

Why don't you guys
finish your little
love-hate thing now.

Yeah, why'd you
send that weirdo
after me for?

What weirdo?
That preacher guy.

You deserved it.
You stole my wallet.

You got me fired!

What?
You wanna go again?

You see, I'm trying
to have a moment here.
It's you!

It's me?
It's you!

It's me.

It's me.

(ALEX WHIMPERING)

Oh.

ALEX: The car blew up.
Anybody see that?


That was really,
really close.

Whoo!

Oh, that was close.

(ALEX LAUGHING AND SOBBING)

Oh, Jesus.

Uh...

That's it, man. I'm done.

You all right,
beautiful?

I am now.

All right.

That was a
nice car, too.

ERIC: All right, diary.
I'm inspired.

Well, the last couple of days
sure have been eye-opening.

I got myself into
some serious shit.

And I nearly got me
and my best friends
killed in the process.

And for what?

To fall out of love.

So this is your
big Tuesday secret?

This is
absolutely insane.

And absolutely awesome.

I don't know
about this, man.
I thought we gave this up.

He just wants
a little cut.

You really
trust this guy, huh?

I don't know.
We had some
weird connection.

Okay. That's...
All right.

Yeah.

(EXCLAIMING IN ANGER)

(SHOUTING ANGRILY)




ERIC: My buddy Zen master
told my buddy, who told me,

"You get
what you resist."

(MAN MOANING)
Oh!

Oh, right there.

Oh, yeah.
Oh, you like that, baby,
don't ya?

It's my favorite.

That Zen shit,

it's for real.

I'm a believer.

"My buddy Zen master
told my buddy, who told me,"

"'You get what you resist.'"

"That Zen shit's for real.
I'm a believer."

What are you readin'?

TARA: (READING) "So now
if anyone ever asks me",

"I remember my exact moment
that I lost that feeling"

"was when I stood
under my"

"ex's window"

"and heard her
lying to me..."

"...and heard her
lying to me,"

"over and over
in a rhythmic climax."

"And for what?"

"To fall out of love."

Thinking about
getting married.

What the fuck...
Yes.

...are you
talking about?

I'm thinking about,
I'm gonna do it.

Why?
Because.

What... Look at me!
Prison! No! Don't do it.

I've gotta do it.
You don't have to do it!

I love her.

So, what does that
even mean?

What does that mean,
you love her?
What does that mean?

It means that
I have invested a lot
of my time into...

So you wanna go
into a legal contract
with the state?

That's all it is.
It's a tribal ritual.

It's been around
for thousands of years.

And idiots just do it
because everybody
before them did it.

And the only reason
why guys get married
at all

is 'cause the idea
of some other dude
gorilla-fucking your woman

is just too much
for you to handle.

It's insecurity.
That's what it is.

It's weak shit.

I'm guilty as charged.
Trust me.
Don't do it.

You don't
need to do it.

But it's a good...
Look, it's an institution.

Marriage is
an institution...

What? So is the KKK!
What does that mean?

Everything's
an institution.

It's a legal contract
with the state
in a relationship.

How the fuck can you say
"till death do you part"?

And it's not
"till death do you part"
anyway.

There's like 65 percent
divorce rate.

You've thought
about this a lot,
I see.

Yeah! Yeah.
You lose
all your shit, dude.

You gotta pay lawyers.
And it's not even half.

It's two-thirds.

'Cause the freakin'
lawyer gets a third.

It's all good, though.
Listen, I'm not trying
to get divorced.

I'm gonna be
married forever, man.

What the fuck
are you talking about,
fantasy boy?

I'm talking
about reality
right now.

You're talking fuckin'
green eggs and ham!

Dawg, all I was
trying to tell you

is that I was
thinking about
getting married.

And I'm telling you,
as a guy who's fucked...

I'm fucked.
You know why I stay?

Because I can't afford
a freakin' lawyer.

And I like my kids.

But you're...
I'm saying,
you got beautiful kids.

What the fuck
does that matter?

I gotta check in
with my wife every time
I wanna go anywhere.

We're at the strip club
right now, partying!

Yeah... No! No, no, no!
We're at Sam's house
playing cards!

And I gotta step outside
in 20 minutes
and make fake phone call.

It's all good.
You think that's fun?

That is fun.
That's the...

You wanna have someone
like your mommy

who you gotta
check in with?


You should really
think about why
you got married.

I thought when
you got married
it's for the...

It's the...
Look, I love my kids.

I love my kids.
Your kids are great.

It's just been awhile
since I seen 'em.

It's been awhile
since I seen 'em.

I got lucky.
My wife's not that bad.

It could be worse.
She's great.

She's great.
It's been awhile
since I seen her.

You don't have to do it.
I can do it, though.

No, you can stay out.

Why don't you come by
for a barbecue next week?

Why don't you
think about it
for a couple of years?

Your girl's Latin.

What's up, dude?
I don't know.

How many babies
you want, 50?

I just want two.
Yeah, whatever.

Boy and a girl.
Two? Two will be
in the first week.

You know,
they're only pregnant for,
like, three months.

They're like a Rottweiler.
Get the fuck
out of here!

They shoot babies out.
Ay, ay, ay!

Get the fuck out.

If she heard you
talking like this,
she'd kick your ass.

I hope you like kids.
You're gonna be
stepping on little pinatas

all around
your fuckin' house.
Oh. (LAUGHS)

Come on, man.
Having babies.
