[dramatic music on TV]

REBECCA CONWAY,
AGE 26, MOTHER OF TWO,

IS NOW MISSING
FOR THREE DAYS.

THIS IS THE SIXTH MISSING PERSON
IN THE TRI-STATE AREA

IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS.

AUTHORITIES BELIEVE
THE ABDUCTIONS ARE RELATED

AND ARE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK

CHASING DOWN ANY AND ALL
POSSIBLE LEADS.

IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION
ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF REBECCA

OR OF ANY OF THE OTHER VICTIMS
MENTIONED IN OUR BROADCAST,

PLEASE CONTACT OUR HOTLINE.

LIVE FROM
THE WOODHAVEN POLICE STATION,

I'M PAMELA WILLIAMS.

TREVOR?

COME ON, MAN, WHY DO YOU GOT
TO BE DOING THIS SHIT?

BAM!

[sighs]

[exhales forcefully]

GOT YOU AGAIN.

CONGRATULATIONS.

YOU'RE A TRUE NINJA MASTER.

FUCKING WEIRDO.

JAKE, I NEED TO SEE YOU
IN MY OFFICE IMMEDIATELY.

WHAT THE FUCK?

WHAT?
WHEN?

OH, THAT'S JUST A LITTLE SOONER
THAN WE EXPECTED,

BUT I'M SURE WE
CAN ACCOMMODATE YOU.

ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL MAKE IT WORK.

THANKS.

AND HAVE A NICE NIGHT.

WHAT?

YOU GOT IT.
YEAH, SURE.

WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

FUCKING PEOPLE.


YOU HEAR ABOUT
THESE ABDUCTIONS?

IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS.

I MEAN, THAT SHIT CAN HAPPEN
RIGHT IN YOUR BACKYARD.

YEAH, DO ME A FAVOR.

PRESS PLAY.

PUT TOGETHER
A LITTLE HIGHLIGHT REEL.

BEST OF JAKE.

HEY.

NICE SWING.

THANKS.

AH, JAKE.


THAT'S ATTRACTIVE.

YEAH.

COME ON.

WISH WE HAD AUDIO.

OOH, THAT'S GOT TO HURT.

THAT'S GOT TO HURT BAD.

YEAH.

IT'S ALL FAIRLY INCRIMINATING.

WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE...


SOUND LIKE MY FUCKING FATHER.

WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

I WAS GETTING SHOT AT.

THAT WAS A PRETTY TOUGH JOB.

NOW, YOU ON THE OTHER HAND,

HAVE A VERY SIMPLE JOB,

AND YOU STILL GOT TO BUST...


BUST MY BALLS,
ACTING LIKE A RETARD.

I'M SORRY, WALTER.

LOOK, I GET IT.

YOU'RE IN THE WOODS
LATE AT NIGHT,

NOBODY'S AROUND,
AND YOU FIGURE

YOU CAN JERK OFF ALL NIGHT.

WELL...

YOU ARE A GROWN ASS MAN,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, LITTLE BUDDY.

START ACTING LIKE IT,
ALL RIGHT?

I MEAN, YOU SEE ALL THOSE
CAMERAS I HAVE HERE, HUH?

YOU SEE THEM ALL?

YOU THINK THEY'RE
FOR DECORATION?

I'M ALWAYS WATCHING, JAKE.

I'M SORRY, WALT.

WHAT THE FUCK, JAKE?

WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU WERE ME, HMM?

WHAT WOULD I DO
IF I WERE YOU?

I'D PROBABLY NOT FIRE ME?

LOOK, COME ON, WALT.
YOU KNOW I LOVE IT HERE.

GET OFF ME,
YOU LITTLE WEIRDO.

JAKE, YOU KNOW
YOU'RE LIKE FAMILY.

I MEAN, SHIT,
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING HERE

SINCE YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

BUT I'M TIRED OF WAITING
FOR YOU TO GROW UP.

IT WAS FUNNY BACK THEN
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

IT'S FUCKING PATHETIC NOW,
PAL.

I MEAN, JESUS, JAKE,
YOU LIVE HERE, MAN.

DO--DO YOU BRING WOMEN HERE?

COME ON, DUDE.

GROW UP.

AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

OH, YEAH.

ONE MORE THING.

IF YOU SEE TREVOR,
TELL HIM I NEED HIM.

HE WON'T ANSWER HIS PHONE.

JESUS CHRIST,
I CAN'T DO IT TONIGHT.

THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

I'M SORRY.
IT'S OUT OF MY FUCKING HANDS.

IT-IT CAN'T BE--

EVEN IF I WANTED TO,
I COULDN'T DO IT.

IT-IT'S TIMING ISSUES.

IT'S INTERNATIONAL
SHIPPING LABELS.


AND IT'S THE TSAs.

IT'S THE FUCKING TSAs.

WHAT?

ARE YOU SERIOUS?

THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY.

THAT IS A LOT OF FUCKING MONEY.

I WILL CALL THE MAJOR.


THAT IS...

A LOT OF FUCKING MONEY.


AH!


HUH!

[Flight of the Valkyries plays]

HYAH! HA!

[dramatic orchestral music]

HYAH! HYAH!

â™ª

BOSS WANTS TO SEE YOU.

[imitates gunshot]

I WIN.

[exhales forcefully]

HELLO, DELIVERY!

ALWAYS ON THE LAST STOP
OF THE DAY.

FUCK IT.

I'LL SIGN IT MYSELF.

[tense music cue]

WHOA, DUDE.

WHOA.

YOU SCARED THE--
OOH.

NEED A SIGNATURE?

YEAH, THIS ONE CAME BACK
UNCLAIMED.

SO WHEN SOMEONE FLAKES
ON THE RENT,

YOU GUYS HAVE AUCTIONS
LIKE ON THOSE TV SHOWS?

[chuckles]
I DON'T WATCH THAT CRAP.

OH.

MY WIFE LOVES THAT SHIT.

SO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ALL
THE STUFF

WHEN SOMEONE FLAKES ON YOU?

I HAVE THIS KID
WHO WORKS FOR ME.

CUTS THE LOCK.
I TOSS IT.

AH, COME ON.

YOU COULD BE THROWING AWAY
A TREASURE.

YOU WATCH TOO MUCH TV.

IT ALWAYS ENDS UP BEING JUNK.

YEAH?

ALL RIGHT, WELL,
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

[doorbell chimes]

HEY, REBECCA.

OH, REBECCA.


THANK YOU FOR THE SACRIFICES
YOU'VE MADE...

AND FOR THE ONE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO MAKE.

NO LIFE IS EVER GIVEN IN VAIN.

DEATH BEFORE SURRENDER.

HERE WE GO.

HOLD STILL, BABY.

HOLD STILL.

OKAY, BREATHE.

BREATHE.

GOOD, GOOD, GOOD,
GOOD, GOOD.

BREATHE.

ISN'T THAT NICE?

ISN'T THAT NICE?

OOH, THAT IS
A BEAUTIFUL INCISION.

HO-HO-HO.

I COULD GIVE FUCKING LESSONS.

[knife clicks]

TZA, TZA, TZA, TZA, TZA...

YES!


HERE WE GO.

HERE WE GO.


NICE.


HM.


AH.

WOW.

[machine flatlining]

YEAH, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

BUT WE DON'T USUALLY DEAL
IN THOSE QUANTITIES.

I MEAN, TRADITIONALLY SPEAKING,

IT'S UNWISE TO RUSH
THESE TYPES OF THINGS,

ESPECIALLY WHEN DEALING
WITH THESE TYPES OF PEOPLE.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
OKAY.

LET'S JUST GET SOMETHING
STRAIGHT, OKAY?

PERSONALLY,
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK

ABOUT YOUR POLITICS.

THIS ISN'T COMING
FROM ME ANYWAY.

I'M JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS.

YOU OUGHT TO KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

I DIDN'T ACCELERATE
THIS SCHEDULE.

IT--IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

OKAY.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

BUT I WANT THE WHOLE PAYMENT
TONIGHT, CASH.

THE RISK IS JUST TOO HIGH.

FINE. DEAL.

FUCK!
WHATEVER.

JUST REMEMBER THIS:

IT IS A LOT OF MONEY.

IT IS A LOT OF FUCKING MONEY.

SO LET'S NOT ROCK THE BOAT.

JUST GET IT DONE,
OKAY?

OKAY, ASSHOLE.

DID YOU JUST FUCKING
HANG UP ON ME?

YOU FUCKING COCKSUCKER.


COME IN.

HEY, PAL.

LET'S CHECK ON THAT NEW LIVER,
HUH?

HERE WE GO.

RIGHT.


OKAY, NO DISCOLORATION.

NO SIGHS OF INFECTION.

MM-MM.

NOT BAD FOR A MAN WHO WAS
SUPPOSED TO DIE IN WADE CITY.

WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
ON THE RIGHT SIDE,

NOTHING KILLS YOU.

OKAY, SO...
[clears throat]

ANY PAIN AT ALL?

UH, JUST THE USUAL.

YOU'RE GETTING REALLY GOOD
AT PAIN THERE, TREVOR.

WELL, IT'S JUST LIKE PRISON.

IT ONLY HURT THE FIRST TIME.

EH, HOO-HOO,
THAT'S ATTRACTIVE.

[both chuckling]

HEY, MAN, GOOD JOB.

LIKEWISE.

SO TELL ME,

DO WE HAVE GOOD NEWS TODAY?

[clears throat]

SOME GOOD,
SOME BAD.

I'LL TAKE THE BAD NEWS FIRST.

[playful hip-hop music]

â™ª

WHAT Y'ALL LOOKING AT?

WEIRDO.

JAKE AND BAKE,
WHAT'S GOOD, BABY?

MAN, GET THE FUCK
OFF THE TRUCK!

SORRY, DUDE.

LOOK, MAN, I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER

RECONSIDERING THE SITUATION.

THIS SUCKS.

WE FINALLY GET INVITED
TO A PARTY,

AND IT GETS MESSED UP.

YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOUR SISTER

WAS GONNA LET US GO TO THAT.

MY MOM MADE HER.
ALL RIGHT.

LOOK, HOMEY,
WE'RE SUPPOSED

TO GO TO MATT'S PARTY,

BUT THEN HIM AND JESSICA
ARE FIGHTING,

AND GOT SHOT DOWN TO SHIT.

NOT MY PROBLEM.

DUDE, LISTEN TO ME.

I GOT BOODLES FOR DAYS,
AND I GOT A KEG.

AND I GOT A PACK OF THAT LOUD

THAT YOU HAVE NEVER EVEN SMELLED
IN YOUR LIFE,

BUT I GOT NO PLACE TO GO.

SO WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

OH.

OH, ALL RIGHT,
SO IT'S LIKE THAT, THEN?

NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

LOOK, I GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF WEED.

I'M GOOD.

NO, NO,
I GOT YOU.

I GET IT.

I MEAN, WHAT WAS I
REALLY THINKING

TRYING TO GET YOU LAID
AT YOUR BORING ASS JOB?

LAID? WHAT LAID?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LAID?

WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME

AS IF SARA-MARIE BEING
IN MY VICINITY

AT THIS VERY MOMENT IS OF ANY
CONCERN TO YOU AT THIS POINT.

YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT,
KID.

CALL MY BLUFF, SON.

OKAY.

UM, LET ME TALK TO HER.

SHE'S OUTSIDE THE PIZZA SPOT

NICE.
WHY NOT?

[rhythmic ringtone playing]

â™ª

MATT?

WHAT, MATT?

WHAT--WHAT--

NO, YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE SUCH A STALKER.

WHAT...

I'M--I'M TRYING TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME WITH MY FRIENDS,

AND I CAN'T DO THAT
WITH YOU CALLING ME

AND TEXTING ME
EVERY FUCKING FIVE SECONDS.

ARE YOU--ARE YOU SERIOUS?
REALLY?

WHOO-HOO-HOO!

GOOD BOYS.


THAT'S RIGHT,
MOTHERFUCKER!

WHO WANTS SOME
OF THIS SHIT?

SORRY.

SORRY.

WHO KNEW YOU HAD IT
IN YOU?

HE'S SPUNKY.
I LIKE HIM.

DUDE, YOU TOTALLY STARTED
BEFORE ME.

I GOT TO TAKE A PISS.

THE BOYS WILL ENTERTAIN YOU.


GREAT.

[clears throat]

[beeping and whirring]

NO CALLS IN.
NO CALLS OUT.

BULLSHIT.

ALL YOU EVER DO IS HANG OUT
WITH YOUR STUPID FRIENDS.

HELLO?

HELLO?

FUCKING CELL!



OH, YOU SCARED
THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

DON'T DO THAT.

LAST I HEARD, THOSE THINGS
ARE BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

[chuckles] LEAST
OF MY PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW.

YEAH, I HEARD YOU YELLING.

GOT A REAL PROBLEM
WITH THAT PHONE, DON'T YOU?

I'D GET MY MONEY BACK
IF I WAS YOU.

WHATEVER.
IT'S FINE.

JUST BULLSHIT.

NO.

IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

I KNOW HOW YOU'RE FEELING
RIGHT NOW.

YEAH, RIGHT.

[R&B music]

YOU KNOW, WINDING DOWN
A RELATIONSHIP

CAN BE A VERY DIFFICULT THING.

TAIL END CAN BE PAINFUL,

AWKWARD,

CONFUSING.

I KNOW.

I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE.

I'M JUST SO SICK OF IT ALL.

I AM SO DONE WITH RELATIONSHIPS.

BELIEVE ME, GIRL,
I FEEL YOU.

THOSE FEELINGS ARE VERY NATURAL
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

BUT...

I GOT A SIMPLE SUGGESTION.

YOU NEED TO STEP BACK,
CLEAR YOUR HEAD.

WE COULD TALK.

IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

NO, I-I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ANYMORE.

I'M DONE TALKING.

â™ª

SOMEONE'S GONNA SEE.

NOBODY'S GONNA SEE.

[laughs]

STEP INTO MY OFFICE.

[laughs]

THEY ARE ALL THE SAME.

REALLY, IT'S INCREDIBLE.

I MEAN, THEY DON'T LISTEN
TO A THING THAT WE HAVE TO SAY.

TAKE YOUR HERO RIP,
FOR EXAMPLE.

YOU GUYS, YOU THINK
HE'S THE MAN, RIGHT,

THAT HE HAS GOT
HIS SHIT TOGETHER, RIGHT?

WRONG.

HE IS A LOST,

PATHETIC LITTLE BOY.

AND ALL BOYS CHEAT
EVENTUALLY.

WE DON'T CHEAT.

YEAH, I'VE NEVER CHEATED.

IT'S 'CAUSE I'M
AN AVID PORN ENTHUSIAST.

[laughing] WHAT?

FACT:

HABITUAL PORNOGRAPHY VIEWING
REDUCES THE CHANCES

OF INFIDELITY BY 80%.

YOU CAN LOOK IT UP.

IT'S TRUE.

MASTURBATION IS THE KEY.

IT'S THE GREAT EQUALIZER.

HELPS GET THE POISON OUT.

SHUT UP AND POUR ME ANOTHER
SHOT, YOU LITTLE MONKEY SPANKER.

YES, MA'AM.
[laughing]

SEE? MAYBE NOT ALL GUYS
ARE BAD.

MAYBE.

BUT THAT RIP,
HE'S A LITTLE SON OF A BISH.

[thumping and grunting]

[groans]


[exhales sharply]

FEEL BETTER?

MUCH.

GLAD I COULD HELP.





I SHOULD GO BACK, BUT...

CAN'T SHOW UP
AT THE SAME TIME.

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?


OBVIOUSLY,
YEAH.

[sighs]

HEY, UM...

UH, ARE YOU GONNA TELL VALERIE?

YEAH.

AROUND THE SAME TIME
YOU TELL MATT.



[buzzy synth music]

OH, MY GOD.

I LOVE THESE CAMERAS.

[thumping techno music]

â™ª

[camera clicks]


â™ª

OH, YEAH.


â™ª

â™ª


YOU GOT THE MOVES
LIKE JAGGER, HONEY.

I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.


LOOK AT HIS LITTLE BUTT SHAKING.

â™ª

WHOO-HOO!

â™ª

SO...

LOOK WHAT I GOT.

OH, MY GOD.
YOU KEPT IT?

YEAH.

I THOUGHT FOR SURE YOU WOULD
HAVE SMASHED IT OR SOMETHING.

LOOK, I WAS HEARTBROKEN,
BUT I'M NOT STUPID.

THAT'S A GREAT PIECE.

[chortles]

THIS THING BRINGS BACK
SOME MEMORIES.

WELL, FIRE IT UP.

COME ON. I'LL GIVE YOU
THE GRAND TOUR.

OH.

YOU KNOW,
I USED TO BE A DANCER.


[clanking sounds]

TAKE YOUR SHIRTS OFF.

REALLY?

MAYBE IF YOU WILL,
I WILL.

OKAY.
[giggling]

I WANT TO SEE YOU FLEX.

COME ON.

LET'S HAVE A COMPETITION.


DUDE, TAKE YOUR
FUCKING SHIRT OFF.

WHA...

I KNEW YOU HAD A WILD SIDE
UNDERNEATH THERE.


OKAY, THAT'S US.

NOW IT'S YOUR TURN,
VALERIE.

MRS. POSNER.

WELL,
A DEAL IS A DEAL.

â™ª SHE WON'T STOP BUGGING ME

â™ª THEN AFTER MY SHOW

â™ª SHE KEEPS CALLING ME

[record scratches]

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
IN HERE?

OH, WE'RE HAVING FUN.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

LET'S GET THE SHIRTS BACK ON,
HUH, GUYS?

OH, SHUT UP.

THESE BOYS KNOW HOW
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

YOU COULD LEARN A LOT
FROM THEM.

AND THEY KNOW HOW
TO TREAT A REAL WOMAN.

AND THEY DON'T HAVE
TO FUCK EVERYTHING

THAT THEY SEE IN A SKIRT.

GIRL, YOU TRIPPIN'.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

WHERE WERE YOU?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHERE WAS I?

WELL, THAT WAS A PRETTY LONG
PISS YOU TOOK THERE?

YOU TIMING MY PISSES NOW?

WELL, I KNOW IT
DOESN'T TAKE 20 MINUTES.

AND I KNOW THAT THAT SKANK
ISN'T BACK YET.

HUH, IT'S FUNNY HOW YOU'RE
BOTH GONE AT THE SAME TIME.

SHE WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO ROLL A BLUNT,

AND I WAS LOOKING FOR JAKE
'CAUSE I KNOW HE'D WANT IN.

AND YOU COULDN'T FIND HIM?

NO.

THIS PLACE IS HUGE.

I WAS YELLING AND EVERYTHING.

I WAS LIKE, "JAKE,
YO, JAKE.

LET'S SMOKE SOME WEED."

NOTHING.

PLUS, WHY WOULD I WANT
TO BE ANYWHERE

BUT RIGHT HERE WITH YOU?

YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE SO CUTE.

PUSSY BROTHERS,

BEAT IT.

THIS IS SO AWESOME.

HE'S SO GONNA BANG HER,
RIGHT?

DUDE,
THIS IS LIKE LIVE PORN,

AND I LOVE PORN.

IF RIP CATCHES YOU,
HE'S GONNA FUCK YOU UP.

THAT'S A CHANCE
I'M WILLING TO TAKE.

I'M NOT GONNA BE
THE ONLY GUY HERE

WHO DOESN'T BUST A NUT
TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE?

HAMILTON?

WHAT?

[retches]

FUCK!

IS THERE MORE?

OH, GROSS.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

I'M GETTING INTO THIS.

[zipper unzips]

GREAT EQUALIZER.


â™ª I'M GETTING LAID, SON

[laughs]

[smooth R&B music]

â™ª

THANK YOU.

[camera clicks and whirrs]

OH.

HOO, THAT'S GONNA BE
A GOOD ONE.

[breathing heavily]

BEST...

NIGHT...

EVER...

[gasping and choking]

[grunting]

GOD, JESS,
THAT IS SO HOT.

WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU JUST CALL ME?

WHAT?
YOU JUST CALLED ME JESS.

NO, I--

smack!
OH!

WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT FOR?

THAT WAS FOR JESS.
THAT'S SOME BULLSHIT!

AND I'M TAKING...

ARE YOU SERIOUS?
AND THIS.

COME ON!

WHERE YOU GOING?

WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

WHERE YOU GONNA GO?

WHAT...

[doorbell chimes]

[chuckles]
BACK FOR SECONDS?

[tense music cue]
OH.

SORRY, UM...

[clears throat]

UM, I'M A FRIEND OF JAKE'S.


YOU MUST BE HIS BOSS.

UM, HE'S NOT GONNA GET
INTO TROUBLE, IS HE?

UM, WE WERE JUST
ABOUT TO LEAVE, ACTUALLY.

UM, I'M SORRY.

UM, WE DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING.
I SWEAR.

[baton clicks]

thud!


YEAH.

HO!

WHOA.

TOO MUCH COFFEE TODAY,
SIR?

ALL THESE KIDS RUNNING
AROUND, I DON'T KNOW.

BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.

WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

I HIT HER
A LITTLE TOO HARD.

TREVOR.

DAMN IT.

DUDE, SHE'S DEAD.

WE CAN'T BE KILLING PEOPLE YET.

DAMN IT.

I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN,
MAJOR.

OKAY, LOOK, WE HAVE TO START
HARVESTING IMMEDIATELY.

JUST GO...

I NEED MORE BODIES.

GET ME MORE BODIES.

SO WE'RE GONNA BE
EXTRA CAREFUL, RIGHT?

SAID THE GUY WHO CRACKED
THE GIRL'S SKULL OPEN.

KILLING IS A LAST RESORT,
TREVOR.

UNDERSTAND?

NOW, I NEED HELP.

THERE'S--THERE'S ONE
MORE OUT THERE.

I THINK HE'S STILL ALIVE.

BRING HIM IN HERE

AND THEN GET OUT THERE
AND CLEAN UP A BIT, ALL RIGHT?

WE GOT A LOT RIDING ON TONIGHT.

WE DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF OPTIONS,

SO GET GOING.

MOVE IT!
COME ON!

WHERE WAS I?

[romantic acoustic guitar music]

IT'S SO QUIET HERE.

YEAH.

YOU ALWAYS LIKED
THE QUIET.

NOT SO MUCH I LIKE THE QUIET.

I JUST DON'T REALLY LIKE NOISE.

THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

[both chuckle]

SO YOU LIKE IT HERE?

LOOK, I KNOW IT'S NOT MUCH
OF A CAREER,

BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.

I MEAN, I'M OUT HERE
BY MYSELF.

NOBODY BUSTS MY BALLS.

NO FAXES.
NO EMAILS TO SEND OUT.

AND...

IT'S ALL PART OF MY PLAN.

OH, YOU HAVE A PLAN NOW?

I GOT A LITTLE PLAN.

I'M INTRIGUED.

TELL ME THIS PLAN.

I DON'T KNOW. I THINK YOU'LL
THINK IT'S PRETTY STUPID.

OH, JUST TELL ME.

MAYBE LATER.

RIGHT NOW,

WAIT HERE

AND KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED.

WHAT?
HEY, NO PEEKING.

UGH!

[door clanging]

OKAY, OPEN 'EM UP.

NO WAY.

WAY.

LET'S SUIT UP.

YOUR JOB IS WAY BETTER
THAN MINE.

[gasping]

OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT
WE GOT HERE.

WHERE IS THIS?

WE NEED A KNEECAP.

AM I IN THE HOSPITAL?

HERE WE GO.

IS MY MOM HERE?

HERE WE GO, PAL.

[cloth tearing]

HEY.
THAT TICKLES.

[chuckles]

OH, IT'S GONNA TICKLE
A LOT MORE.

WHAT?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

NO.


ALL RIGHTY.

AH, SHIT.

SHIT!

WHA-WHAT?

I OPENED
THE WRONG FRICKIN' KNEE.

EH, WE'RE OKAY.

I'LL FIX IT.

NO! NO!

[retching]

HEY, BUDDY,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

FOOD POISONING.

I DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING.
I SWEAR.

RELAX. I'M NOT GONNA BUST YOU
OR NOTHING.

YOU'RE ONE OF JAKE'S PALS,
RIGHT?

YEAH.

WE WERE JUST HANGING.

YEAH, I KNOW.

HAVING A FEW BEERS, HUH?

YEAH, AND A LOT
OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

I USED TO GET FOOD POISONING
EVERY WEEKEND.

[chuckles]

COME ON.

LET'S GET YOU SOME WATER.

THANKS, MAN.

[blippy bass music]

â™ª

[exhales sharply]

[toy guns warbling]

THIS PART OF YOUR PLAN?

[toy gun warbling]

COME ON.

GET YOU A SEAT HERE.

MAN, YOUR HEAD MUST BE
REALLY SPINNING RIGHT NOW.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

I'M GONNA GET YOU
A CUP OF JOE.

THANKS.

[ominous music]

â™ª

I GOT SOME ASPIRIN.

I GOT SOME ASPIRIN.

THAT'LL HELP WITH THE, UH...

HANGOVER HEADACHE.

THANKS SO MUCH.

HEY, FRIEND OF JAKES...

FRIEND OF MINE.

AS LONG AS WE'RE FRIENDS,

YOU MIND IF I USE THAT PHONE?

I GOT TO CALL MY SISTER

TO FIGURE OUT HOW
I'M GETTING HOME.

YEAH, SURE, SURE.

CALLBACK NUMBER'S ON THE PHONE.

[receiver clicks]

[buttons clacking]

STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL.
WHAT THE FRIG, JESS?

HEY, JESS, IT'S ME.

I THINK WE'RE ALL ABOUT READY
TO BLAST OUT OF HERE,

SO, I DON'T KNOW,
CALL ME BACK.

OR SOMETHING.

[glass shatters]

EVERYBODY, HELP!

THEY'RE GONNA KILL US!

CALL THE COPS!
CALL THE--

HA!

SON OF A BITCH.

[eerie music]

â™ª

I'M SORRY.

[truck hood creaking]

[grunts]

FUCK!

OH!

GROSS.

UGH.

RIP?

DON'T EVEN TRY

I AM SO DONE WITH YOU.

I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME HOME
AND LOSE MY NUMBER.

[ominous music]


â™ª




YOU KNOW WHAT?
FUCK ALL YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!

I'M GOING TO IHOP!

[engine grinding]

WHAT THE FUCK?

[engine grinding]

GOT TO BE FUCKING WITH ME!

WHICH ONE OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS
DID THIS?

SO I GOT TO DO A COUPLE MORE
THINGS WITH THE ENGINE,

AND THEN SHE'S READY
TO ROCK.

THEN WHAT?

I'M GONNA GET HER IN THE WATER

AND GO.

GO WHERE?

HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT PART YET?

I'M THINKING, LIKE,
TAKE A WEEK OFF,

MAYBE A MONTH,
JUST CRUISE.

MAYBE A WHOLE SUMMER.

I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

I TOLD YOU YOU'D THINK
IT WAS STUPID.

I DON'T THINK IT'S STUPID.

I THINK IT'S KIND OF GREAT.

LIKE AN ADVENTURE.

JAKE!

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

NOTHING.

ACTUALLY, YOU SEE
THAT FENCE OVER THERE?

YEAH.
SEE THAT RED FLASHING LIGHT?

[gasps]
WHAT IS IT, A CAMERA?

NO, IT'S, UH,
THE ELECTRIC FENCE.

IT MEANS IT'S ARMED.

LIKE, IF YOU WERE
TO TOUCH IT RIGHT NOW,

YOU'D GET FUCKED.

BUT...

THEY ONLY ARM THE FENCE
WHEN NOBODY'S HERE,

AND IT WASN'T ON
WHEN I GOT HERE,

SO SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENED.

PROBABLY WHEN
THE POWER WENT OUT.

BUT WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT,
I--

THINGS DON'T USUALLY
GET TURNED BACK ON.

I'M WITH YOU.

SOMETHING'S WRONG, JAKE.

NOTICE HOW QUIET IT IS?

WELL, YEAH,
YOU KNOW,

UH, KIND OF PART
OF THE WHOLE PLAN.

WE GOT BOAT.
WE GO THE STARS.

JAKE, YOU SHOULD GO CHECK THE
CIRCUIT BREAKER OR SOMETHING.

SARA-MARIE...

IF YOU GO CHECK IT OUT,
I'LL LET YOU FUCK ME AGAIN.

ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET ON THAT BREAKER.

RICHIE!

HAMILTON!

WHAT THE FUCK?

THIS IS REAL FUNNY,
I BET, HUH?

THIS IS TOTALLY FUCKED.

WHAT?

I DON'T--
THIS WOULD BE--

zap!
[screams]

JAKE, TALK TO ME.

DON'T TOUCH THAT.

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?

I DON'T KNOW WHO
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

IT'S, LIKE, RIGGED
SO WE CAN'T GET OUT.

WE SHOULD CALL THE COPS.

ALL THOSE MISSING PEOPLE
ON THE NEWS.

IT COULD BE A MALFUNCTION

OR SOMETHING.

I DON'T KNOW.
WE CAN'T CALL THE COPS.

WE'RE ALL FUCKED UP.

THERE'S WEED EVERYWHERE.

LIKE, THE...

LET'S JUST ROUND
EVERYBODY UP, OKAY?

I'M GONNA KILL YOU WHEN
I FIND YOU, YOU LITTLE PRICKS!

[ominous string music]

â™ª

WE CAN'T KILL JAKE, WALT.

THINGS HAVE GONE
WAY TOO FAR.

HEY, IT HASN'T
GONE FAR ENOUGH.

WHAT?
MAJOR--

TREVOR,

WHEN THE FUCK
ARE YOU GONNA REALIZE

WE GOT A SHITLOAD OF MONEY
RIDING ON THIS, MAN?

I HATE EYES.

MM.

LOOK, MAN, YOU DO
WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

WE'RE STILL SHORT.

SERGEANT,
I NEED MORE BODY PARTS.

MAKE IT HAPPEN.

PRONTO.

YES, SIR.

[machine beeping]

OOH.

NICE.

GOD, I'M GOOD.

[golf club clattering]

[grunts]

OH, SHIT.

WHAT THE FUCK?

[electrical zapping]

WHOA!

YO, WE GOT
TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

SOMEBODY'S KILLING EVERYBODY.

KILLING EVERYBODY?

WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

OH, MY GOD.

WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

WE CAN'T.
THE FENCE IS LIVE.

WHERE'S YOUR TRUCK?

TRUCK'S FUCKED.
SOMEBODY CUT THE WIRES.

WHERE DID ALL
THAT BLOOD COME FROM?

I SLIPPED IN IT.

IT'S PART OF A FUCKING TRAIL.

SOMEBODY GOT DRAGGED
THROUGH THERE.

ALL RIGHT, SARA-MARIE,
CALL THE POLICE.

WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING?

THE FUCK?

IT'S NOT WORKING.

I HAD FULL SERVICE
WHEN WE GOT HERE.

I GOT NOTHING.

NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION.

[door squeaking]

MY FIRST DAY ON THE JOB,

I WAS DOING A LITTLE EXPLORING.

THIS SHIT WAS PRETTY COOL.

THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

HOLD UP.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

WHO CARES?
YOU GOT THE CROSSBOW.

SHOOT IT.

[bowstring snaps]

[screams]

NOBODY MOVES.

NOBODY GETS HURT.

WHAT THE FUCK?

TREVOR?

OH, THERE GOES JAKE
THE HERO,

MAKING PLANS NOW.

HE'S ALL GROWN UP.

[grunts]

AH! GOD! GAH!

HOLY SHIT.
THAT ACTUALLY WORKED.

AH!

AH!

HA! AH!

AH!

FUCKING KIDS!

FUCKING KIDS!

YOU HAVE NO IDEA!

YOU HAVE NO IDEA!

YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA!

AH!


HELLO, BABY.

GOOD GIRL.

YOU TRIED TO TRAP US.

WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

LET'S TAKE A WALK.

SARA-MARIE!

YOU CRAZY? HE'S GOT
A FUCKING GUN!

HANG ON!

LET'S JUST FIGURE THIS OUT
FOR A SECOND.

WE GO RUNNING AFTER HER;
WE'RE ALL GONNA GET SHOT.

WE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

LET'S JUST CUT 'EM OFF
AND GO AROUND.

SEE? THAT'S WHAT THE FUCK
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

RUNNING OUT AND GETTING
ALL TYPES OF SHOT-UP--

THAT'S THE SHIT
THAT I CAN'T FUCK WITH.

NOW WE GOT A PLAN.


OUT OF MY LIGHT.

YOU LOOK SO HEALTHY,
YOU KNOW THAT?


clang!
OH!

DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

COME ON, JAKE!

AW, COME ON, JAKE.

WE JUST WANT YOU
TO GO HOME.

WE DON'T NEED ANY PROBLEMS,
OKAY?

[flare gun clicking]

WE LOVE YOU, BRO.

DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE GETTING
SO NERVOUS.

[exhales sharply]

HOW LONG HAVE I KNOWN YOU?

SINCE YOU WERE A KID, RIGHT?

[flare gun clicks]

[flare whooshes]

FUCK.

smack!


CAN'T YOU JUST LISTEN?

AH!



I'M SORRY, JAKE.

[panting]

[machines hissing and beeping]

[ominous music]

â™ª

THIS IS A DREAM.

GOT TO BE.

[clears throat]

[dramatic music]

â™ª

TREVOR.

DISARM THE MAIN GATE.

THEY'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

[sighs heavily]

[clears throat]

HELLO, BABYCAKES.

OBJECTIVE COMPLETE,
MY BROTHER?

HO!

YOU PUT THAT FLARE GUN DOWN,

OR I SLIT HER THROAT WITH THIS
VERY SHARP SWITCHBLADE.

WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,
WALT?

THE TRUE GREATEST REASONS
ANY MAN DOES ANYTHING.

FOR GOD AND COUNTRY.

[machine beeps]

PUT IT DOWN.

[grunts]


IT'S OVER, OLD BUDDY.

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

DEATH BEFORE SURRENDER.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
TREVOR?

IT'S TIME TO PULL OUT,
WALT.

TOO MANY CASUALTIES.

TOO MANY INNOCENT LIVES
HAVE BEEN LOST.

INNOCENT LIVES ARE LOST,

BUT THAT'S THE COST OF FREEDOM.

YOU THINK FREEDOM
IS THE RESULT OF WAR?

YOU THINK PEACE
IS THE RESULT OF WAR?

MURDER IS THE RESULT OF WAR!

WRONG, TREVOR.

MURDERS IS THE RESULT
OF FUCKING WITH ME.

HUH!

[grunting wildly]

YOU ARE RELIEVED
OF YOUR DUTY, SERGEANT.

YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

YOU'RE REALLY NOT THINKING
THIS THROUGH, KID.

YOU GOT AN AWFUL LOT
OF BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS HERE.

BUNCH OF KIDS.

DRUGS, ALCOHOL.

THESE PARTIES GET OUT
OF HAND SOMETIMES, HUH?

IT'S OVER, WALTER.

I'M TAKING HER,

AND WE'RE GETTING
THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

IS THAT A FACT?


I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE
THE BALLS TO PULL THAT TRIGGER.

SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

GONNA CALL THE COPS?

AND WHO THE FUCK
ARE THEY GONNA BELIEVE?

A DECORATED WAR VETERAN

OR SOME BUST-OUT WHO LIVES
IN A PARKING LOT?

OH, BY THE WAY, JAKE,

YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ARE ALL OVER THE VICTIMS,

ALL OVER THE WEAPONS.

AND THESE ARE ALL YOUR FRIENDS,
GOOD BUDDY.

WHY THE FUCK
ARE YOU STILL ALIVE, HUH?

IT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD
FOR YOU, JAKE.

FUCK YOU, WALTER.

BEFORE I BLOW HER BRAINS OUT,

I'M GONNA MAKE YOU ONE OFFER
ONE TIME.

YOU SEE THIS PHONE?

THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS.

IT RINGS;

YOU ANSWER;

YOU GET TO KEEP THE MONEY.

NOT BAD, HUH?


[Trevor groaning]

[moaning]


JAKE, JAKE...

HE WAS A GOOD MAN...

ONCE.

HE GAVE ME A KIDNEY
IN WADE CITY.


HE OPERATED ON HIS OWN SELF.

HE--HE DID.

I JUST SAVED HIS LIFE,
AND HE SAVED MINE.

HE BELIEVED IN REDUNDANCY,
WALT DID.

HE SAID THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TWO KIDNEYS.

IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO ONE,

WE HAD...

A SPARE.

YOU COULD EVEN GIVE ONE...

AWAY!

GODDAMN!

IT'S REDUNDANCY.


YOU WIN, JAKE...

â™ª YEAH, I CHEWED IT UP
AND I SPIT IT OUT â™ª

â™ª I JUST TAKE IT EASY

â™ª AT LEAST I TRY

â™ª BUT THEY'RE SIDE BY SIDE

â™ª WHOA, SIDE BY SIDE,
HEY â™ª

â™ª 'CAUSE THEY GO
SIDE BY SIDE â™ª

â™ª AND I DON'T DECIDE

â™ª 'CAUSE I'M THE ONE FAILING

â™ª YEAH, YEAH, HEY

â™ª WHOA, WHOA

â™ª AND I DON'T DECIDE

â™ª 'CAUSE I'M THE ONE FAILING

â™ª YEAH, HEY, HEY

â™ª WHOA, WHOA

â™ª WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA

â™ª HEY, HEY

[music slows]
