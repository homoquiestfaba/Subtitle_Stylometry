' Inside my memory '

' There's a Iist
of forgotten things '

' Tracing back to
an Indonesian restaurant '

' And outside on the patio '

' There's a man
named Horatio '

' He makes his Iiving

' He caIIs them fantasies '

' Gimme some more '

' Some more of your IoVe! '

I run...

a successfuI

underground escort service.

I recruit from a rec room

on the third fIoor of my dorm

where l pimp the kids
from my boarding schooI.

ln fact, l have two
of my boys right here.

And they are
just one tabIe away

from one of my tricks.

Now I know you'Ve probabIy
got about 20 questions

right on the tip
of your tongue.

WeII, if you must know,

then Iet us begin.

Sam!

Over here.

Sam, you have been kicked out

of a couple of Very prominent

boarding schooIs in this country.

Okay, yes, but about that--
Stop.

I read your transcripts.
You'Ve got a 3.87

three years and running.

You've got some kick-ass
writing sampIes to boot.

You aIso cIearIy have
a probIem with authority.

And it just
makes my mind wonder,

"What exactly
am I in for here, Sam?"

Okay, noted.

But here is the thing:

I wasn't exactly kicked out
of all my schools per se.

I am somebody that you would
consider a victim of, um...

Circumstances?
Circumstances, yes.

And you know what?
Most peopIe don't believe it,

but...

I've journaIed about it, man.
You can read it if you want.

Just give me the CIiff Notes.
Summarize, Sam.

' Donkey see, donkey do '

' I don't wanna go to school '

' Hey baby bIue, put your feet
on the ground '

' Feet on the ground '

' Let your head spin around '

' Talk about the sun,
forget about the moon '

' TeII me not to Ieave
not a day too soon '

' Donkey see, donkey do,
I don't wanna go to schooI '

' Danke, try to make my day,
l don't wanna participate '

' Yeah '

' Hey baby bIue,
put your feet on the ground '

' Feet on the ground,
Iet your head spin around '

' Talk about the sun,
forget about the moon '

' TeII me not to Ieave
not a day too soon '

' Donkey see, donkey do,
I don't wanna go to schooI. '

Mom.
Sam?

That's tough.

Nah, you know, it's just kinda...

par for the course
when your mom's an ex-PIaymate.

WeII put.

I know your mom.

Hmm?
ReaIIy?

You know, Sam,
she's a nice Iady.

Batshit crazy,
but she's a good chick.

So is that you?

That, my friend,
was the EIiminator tour.

Eight years of more pussy
than any one man couId ever handIe...

which, by the way,
is why you shouId wear a rubber.

Or you'II find yourseIf
knocking up the wrong groupie

and trading in your dream

of a harmonica soIo
with Billy Gibbons

to become the headmaster
of a private academy.

But...

I Iove my daughter.

She taught me
how to respect women.

Or some shit like that.
You ready for the $5 tour?

This is our history department.
lan, get off that cell phone.

Oh good.
'Cause I'm a history nut.

I'm a reaIIy big fan
of the French RevoIution,

especiaIIy NapoIeon.
l love Napoleons.

They're very tasty.
Have you ever had one?

So you're a writer and a dick?

I'd be carefuI of your roomie here.

I hear he's a bit of a strange bird,

Iikes to whip out the fifi bag

when the Iights go down.

What is a fifi bag?

Bukowski term.

What is a Bukowski?

A Bukowski?

WeII, it's not a Rusty Trombone

or a Gorilla Mask.
A Bukowski is a writer.

A poet?

Come on.
"Notes from a Dirty OId Man"?

"Ham on Rye"?
"Post Office"?

Hm-mm.

WeII,

it's good you're continuing your education.
You came to the right pIace.

You keep your GPA up,

no swearing within earshot,

and stay out of troubIe,

so I can keep you

from getting your ass
kicked out this go around.

Capisce?

Yeah, of course.

PIus, how much mayhem
could l possibly cause

in a school that's got
tea cozies on the waII?

' Eff that,
take the radio back '

' l'm coming
with that stadium rap '

' I got the stadium packed '

' From the front to the back,
make the stadium clap '

' Let's keep it moving,
I see you workin' '

' FIy girIs, freaks
and the virgins '

' Take the radio back '

' Chris Young coming
with that stadium rap '

' HeIIo, C Young
with the stadium raps '

' She ain't a Kimora Simmons,
but the baby is phat! '

' And l keep
my cranium packed '

' With more Uranium than
they didn't have in lraq. '

Hey!

Knock it off.

Look, I can expIain.

You know what? Sir, I can expIain.
Shawn and his friends

tried to smoke us again.
lt wasn't his fault.

You caIIed me Snoop, racist.
That's a Iie.

You said degrading stuff
about my stature, dipshit--

l mean, Shawn.
Sir, it's true. He started it.

Shawn.
What?

Come on. You're not actuaIIy gonna
buy this side of the story, are you?

You're teasing and fighting
with the new kid aIready?

And you wonder why
you're a fifth-year senior.

Dan--
Sir!

Sir.

He waIked in, we were hanging out,
he punched me in the face.

BIame is the first sign
of weakness.

Now apoIogize.

Fuck that.
Fuck that?!

Headmaster?
Language? Demerits?

Does any of that ring
a goddamn beII to you?

This is buIIshit.

Tuck in that damn shirt

and be in my office
in 10 minutes.

Come here.

WeII, you do haVe a string
of bad luck, don't you?

That's the worst kid I got.
I toId you.

Yeah?

WeII, why don't we try
to change that now?

That's a good idea.

Go make some new friends.

Now.

Sam.
Sam, thank you so much.

You are our savior.
I'm not gonna Iie to you.

That guy's such a douche.
He does that aII the time.

We shouId hang out sometime.

By the way, l'm Jimmy.
This is Chuck. This is Teddy.

Where are you from? I'm having
a hard time, but I'm thinking it's Manhattan.

I'm getting this tri-state area
kind of thing. New York?

Yeah, it's New York
with that handshake that you're doing.

Okay, caIm down.
Look, it's good to meet you guys

and I reaIIy appreciate
the camaraderie

in front of the headmaster
back there, but I gotta...

Oh.
Yeah.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
For sure. No worries.

Um, thank you.

And just in case
you want to know--

Iike when you reaIize that this pIace
is a complete shithole--

we'II be waiting.
We'II be here.

Right here, bro.
CooI.

If you need a friend...
Sounds good.

Thank you.

' lt's just another story
with a hook, Iine, sinker and a snag '

' lt's only good if they
make you think it's bad '

' And I make my day
with the jagged IittIe Iines of fear '

' TiII I find out I got nothing near '

' Out at the seaside stomp '

' lt's just another story

' It's onIy good
if they make you think it's bad. '

Okay okay,
first of aII, first of aII--

don't hog it
'cause I bought that.

And of course.

Ooh-hoo.

WeII weII weII.

Look who it is.

It's actuaIIy surprising.
I thought it wouId take Ionger.

You want to partake in some
recreationaI substance abuse?

I got some Scotch--
single malt.

Go for it, bro.
That's good, actuaIIy.

So stoned.

You guys are aII right.

No no no no.
Shh.

Oh yeah, be quiet,

'cause Jesus Christ absoIution
is just mere steps away.

Oh, but seriousIy.

I beat off to your mom.

What?
What?

Don't act Iike you're surprised.
You know me.

It's no offense,
no offense.

No offense. Just if you're gonna
be friends with us,

you shouId know.

Multiple times.
AII right, come on, dude.

She's fuckin' gorgeous.
lt's fine. lt's fine.

lt's fine.
It's my cross to bear.

Look, to eVen the keeI,
if it makes you feeI any better,

my dad's partner
was Bernie Madoff.

Ouch.
And my mom's a freak.

My dad, he's an ex-baIIer.

Says l cramp his
any-given-Sunday IifestyIe.

Yeah, and I'm Asian.

He is. You shouId see this guy
drift in a Honda Civic.

Dick.

So what's there
to do around here?

So this is Main Street, huh?

Yup.
Open weekend--

the finaI frontier.

I fuckin' Iove
the weekends, bro.

I IoVe the girIs.

Go taIk to them.

What do you mean?

What do you mean
what do l mean?

We'Ve been waIking
up and down this street.

You've seen
the same girIs aII day.

Go up, say hi.
Go taIk to them.

Sam, if you haven't noticed,
we're not that cool.

Oh, come on, Chuck.

Except for Jimmy. He's got aII the bitches
on lock, ain't that right, Hef?

God damn, man.
Fuck both of you. I'm pIotting, asshoIes.

You know that's how I do--
why wouId you-- such a dick.

You know what? You guys
hoId that thought. I'II be right back.

Where you goin', man?
I'm gonna go taIk to that girI.

I probabIy shouId have
wingmanned that one, huh?

Hi.

l'm sorry.
Do we know you?

Um...
This is the eye-fucker from Moore.

Oh my God,
you're the eye-fucker?

I guess I am
the eye-fucker

and l've been
compIeteIy caIIed out.

So congratuIations.

WeII, thank you,
thank you.

So now that we've got the
pIeasantries out of the way,

do you care to sit down
and join us for a Iatte?

Yeah.
Great.

I'm Courtney.
Hi.

And this is Angie.
And you are...?

Uh, Sam.

WeII, nice to meet you, Sam.
What up?

Hi.

WeII, what are you doing

on this gIorious sunny day,
young Samuel?

l'm just kind of
hanging out with my friends.

Oh, you have friends.

WeII, that's noveI.

AII my friends are dead
if you were wondering.

WeII, except for her,

but she's not reaIIy a friend
so I guess that doesn't count.

Thanks, bitch.
l love you.

I IoVe you too.
Make-out session Iater?

What's so funny?
You. You're funny.

He's charming.

God knows I'm trying.

HoId that thought.

HeIIo.

Yeah.

Okay.

Wow.

Fine. Fine.

Okay, bye.

We got to jam.
10-4.

What do you mean?
Why you going so soon?

We're just-- just starting to
haVe so much fun.

It's my mom-- she's crazy and she spit
in a bartender's face now.

So we got to go pick her up.
Sweet.

Crazy bitch. Sounds Iike my mom.
They shouId probabIy carpooI.

That's-- he's funny.

You're cute too.

AII right. I'm thoroughIy bored
with this now.

I'm gonna get some
motherfuckin' fudge.

Do you want any?
I'm-- I'm good on the motherfuckin' fudge,

but thanks, girI.
Bye.

Nice girI.

So, uh, same time,
same pIace next weekend?

Yeah.

Phone, please.
I'm sorry. What?

So I can put my number in it
so we can make plans.

Do you haVe Asperger's
or something?

l don't know
what's wrong with you.

WeII, I just don't think
we're at the swapping--

swapping digits phase yet.
It's aII moving a IittIe fast for me.

Oh, l see.
It's so fast.

WeII then, no number for you.
WeII done, prince charming.

Good job.
Yo, tampon,

we got to go pick up
your aIkie mother.

Wait two seconds.
Jesus, Angie.

Hi. Sorry.
Here here.

You sure?
Yeah.

Bye.
Bye.

Nice fucking work, dude.

WiII you be my mentor?
That'll be nice.

That was amazing.
Okay, Iet's not jump on him aII at once.

Let's have some coffee
Iike some ciViIized peopIe.

You don't even drink coffee.
'Cause it tastes like shit.

"And so l return
to the question at hand.

Do we resign ourseIves
to the sad truth

that our existence is pureIy
an exercise in human foIIy?

Or do we embrace every moment
of that existence

and forget about what it might
amount to one day?"

Now we all know
what Camus thinks--

It's fucking "Cammuss."
Crazy, right?

It's Camus, you idiot.
lt is?

Do you guys eVer read?

Sam?

Hey.
Hey.

Uh, uh, sit down.

Uh, yeah.
In a second.

l've got to tell you
something, though.

I, um...

met a girI.

And one that's not
in a straitjacket,

which is a pretty big
improvement for me.

Sam.
And then

I'm actuaIIy pretty sure
I compIeteIy aced

my Iiterature presentation

thanks to your
recommended reading.

I'm going out on the streets with this...
Sam.

...'cause l had no idea that
French-Moroccan existentiaIism

could be just
so damn fascinating.

Sam, I just got off the phone.

Your mother can't pay
for your schooI anymore.

We had a good run.

You know, you were, uh--

you were cooI,
my friends were cooI.

I got a IittIe Bukowski
out of it,

but I guess at the end
of the day,

eVen my mom's tits
aren't recession-proof.

Yeah.

Come on, man.
I Ieft my ID in my room.

l don't feel like
going to get it.

Can you pIease just giVe me a drink?
Nice try, junior.

He's with me.

Yeah, I-- I'm with her.

That's why I don't have my ID,
because I Ieft it in our room.

So how about you
just pour me that drink?

WhiIe you're at it,
you can refiII hers

and when you're done, you can bring it
to the tabIe. How about that?

Thank you.
Thank you.

And aIso, thank you.

You Iooked Iike
you needed it.

Oh boy, I did.

I actuaIIy stiII do.

Um, I'm Sam,
by the way.

I'm AIison.
Good to meet you, AIison.

Rough night?

Gotcha.

Me too.
Yeah.

My husband's mistress

showed up
at my house tonight

to compIain to me about
how he's cheating on her tonight.

S-s-shit.

l mean, l'm sure
that he can expIain.

He's reaIIy good at expIaining.

He's a very good expIainer.

Like, he couId've expIained--
Yes, okay. Right, Iook,

Okay, here we go.
--that I was married--

Why don't we do this?
Why don't we do this?

Your husband's
a fucking asshoIe.

Okay?
I wouId...

I mean, what?
He goes out

and he cheats on you?

Twice?

And then he fuckin'
tries to explain?

What are you taIking about?
Who the heII cheats on you?

I mean, Iook at you.
You're beautifuI.

You'Ve got these eyes,
they sparkle.

They're Iike diamonds,
you know?

God, what?

That was reaIIy bad.

That just...

won't sound genuine.
Oh good.

No, it's a good thing.

So... so you go to school
around here or something?

Yeah, kinda.

Kinda.
Kinda?

How oId are you, Sam?

18.

Yeah, I shouId probabIy

get out of here
and get going.

You probabIy shouId.

I'II buy you another drink.

My husband probably
shouIdn't haVe cheated on me.

Twice.
Twice.

So...

So...
So...

l'm gonna stay
in town tonight.

Just teII RiIey
that I Iove him.

Okay?

Okay. Bye.

Is this creepy?

Creepy?

This is freaking amazing.

This is crazy.

I'm not that oId,
you know.

I'm not that young.

TechnicaIIy I'm not even
a senior anymore

because I can't pay
for my tuition.

This is fun, right?

Yeah.

This is fun.

You haVe an amazing ass.

So hey, you wanna
have fun again?

AbsoIuteIy.

I couId have fun aII night.

I bet you can.
l can.

Good.
Great.

Less taIking, more doing.
Okay.

AII right, so Iet me
get this straight.

This chick was hot,

brought you to her suite,
got you drunk,

had sex with you
multiple times

and Ieft you with a fucking
check in the morning?

Yeah.

That's fucking amazing. Why don't shit
like that ever happen to me, Jimmy?

It can.
It can.

Yeah.
Sam, she's got friends, right?

Yeah, she's got friends.
And you haVe money probIems.

Yes, I haVe money probIems.
Okay, so?

So what?
So hook it up.

Dude, it's not
what you think.

l don't even know
if I'm gonna caII this girI again.

Okay, this is Iike
a once-in-a-Iifetime thing.

Yeah, or Iike
a once-in-a-week time thing.

You fuckin' know it.
You know what I mean?

Guys, stop.
Come on.

Look, if you haVen't
already guessed it,

I'm a Virgin, okay?
Yeah, l know.

$500 is good.
I get it, okay?

l don't know
what you did with it,

but the fact
of the matter is

if we could parlay that
into two grand a week,

Sam, we couId pay for your tuition
in two months or less.

Like that. You couId stay in schooI
and we couId aII hang out again.

Plus we'd be bringing joy to
unhappiIy-married women eVerywhere.

Whoa whoa whoa.
Yes!

And Teddy, by the way,
great VaIid point.

SeIfIess-- I Iike
where your head's at.

Thank you, sir.
He made a vaIid point.

I'm just saying.
The fact of the matter is

there are probabIy
tons-- tons

of smoking hot miIfs

waiting for some young
guiIt-free kieIbasa.

AII you haVe to do is make the connection,
pimp this shit out

and it's done. It's a fuckin' wrap--
bills on you.

You want to lay in bills?
You want to take a bath in biIIs?

Okay, couId you pIease stop Iistening
in on our fucking conversation?

l'm sorry.
It just sounds awesome.

I mean, if you ever
need any heIp...

Yeah yeah, sure.
We'II giVe you a fuckin' caII.

Just stop Iooking at me.

So...

Hey, do you think
we can carve out

a IittIe bit to do
a schoIarship for a kid

who's having some
financiaI probIems?

What?
WeII, you said we had a IittIe extra.

WeII, not entireIy extra.

It's for Sam LoweII.

We're a boarding schooI,
not a commune.

I think we shouId concentrate
on the kids that are aIready here

as opposed to some charity case
you might want to bring in.

Bruce, this is not
a charity case.

AII right?
This is a good kid.

I mean, what do you think
we do here as teachers?

We're here to inspire.

WeII, I'm aII for inspiring,

but we're in a recession.

I know that.
I can't eVen get enough money

for new band instruments.

Coach Jackson wants new turf
for his Iacrosse fieId.

I'd Iike a IittIe money
for my Women's Lib program.

What do they need
to know about women?

You teII the good-Iooking
ones they're smart

and you teII the smart ones
they're good-Iooking.

Look, I'm trying to have
a decent conversation--

This is a conversation.
You're not listening.

Sir?
What is it, Cy, what?!

Sam LoweII is back
on campus.

He says he can pay
for his tuition.

HeIIo?

She answer it?
l don't-- hello?

Is that my mom?

AIi, it's Sam.

Sam?
No, it's for your mom.

It's Sam.
Hey.

Hey, who was that?
Uh, it's...

just a friend.
Your mom's a cougar.

So I'm gIad you caIIed.

Yeah, me too.

Look, anyway, I was
just thinking about

how great
Iast weekend was.

And I was wondering if maybe
you weren't busy this weekend,

we couId...
Do it again?

Yeah.
I thought you had to IeaVe schooI.

No, l do.
WeII, I did.

Anyway, that's kind of
what I wanted to taIk to you about.

I don't know if this
sounds weird or anything,

but l was wondering
if maybe this weekend

you couId bring
some of your friends...

Sit your ass down.

...and I couId bring
some of my friends.

And then some of your friends
couId give some of my friends,

uh, some Ietters too,

you know, to help
for my education fund?

Oh.
Or not.

I mean, it's totaIIy fine.

It was just an idea.
Just a stupid--

It's not a stupid idea.

Ask him if he has any friends.

They told--
Are you positiVe he's here?

I'm dead positiVe.
In here?

Yes-- I mean, 95% positiVe.

HeIIo?
Sam?

Sam?

Sam?
What?

Hold on.
He asked me.

AIison?
TeII him yes.

l don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?

What's your fuckin' probIem?

AIison?

Boys?

Dan-o.
Sir.

Um, sir,

if I may,

l think that we might
haVe found a soIution

to Sam's IittIe
economic issue.

A soIution?

Uh, yeah. A job.

A job?

A job that pays
$20,000 a semester?

What is it?
Ponzi scheme?

Nah, man.
WeII, sir,

my dad has some work
we can do for his company.

And see, it's a tax
sheIter kind of thing.

Tax sheIter.
Tax sheIter.

Yeah, Iike a 501(c), sir.

Is this a fuckin' joke?
Sir?

Um... we, uh--

Sam has a down payment.

I can see it.

Okay.

Are you boys seIIing drugs?

AII right.
l'll bite.

WeIcome back, Sam.

WhateVer you're doing,

keep it cIean.

Yeah.

They're young boys,
pick of the litter,

and they're a heII of a Iot cheaper
than a pair of Louis Vuittons.

Which pair? Wait,
what are you taIking about?

Judy, quit it.
We're not doing this.

WiII you stop?
Doing what?

Why do you two
aIways excIude me?

lt's 'cause
I'm younger, isn't it?

You just don't think
l understand--

Enough.
Whoa.

What?
Testy. Shit.

For your information,

AIison here is
acting aII bitchy

because I want to set up
some paid pIaydates

with a few boys
from Moore.

PIaydates?
Yes.

You mean for shagging?
Mm-hmm, I think it's so cooI.

l think it sounds awful
and compIeteIy iIIegaI.

Yes, it is, Judy.

Stop being such
a fucking square, Mary.

Mary is not a square.
She's oId fashioned.

I'm sorry,
but marrying an agent

who's gonna heIp our IittIe Ginger here
with her career

and give her a life of arm candy
doesn't make her oId fashioned.

It makes her a fucking moron.
Oh my God, excuse me.

Okay, stop.

Mary, don't Iisten to her.

And you,
I'Ve made myseIf cIear.

l don't think
we shouId do this.

What is the big deaI? You aIready did it.
And look at you.

It wasn't Iike that.

ReaIIy?
No.

You gaVe him
a check though.

You gaVe him a check?

Mary, I IoVe you,

but we're much oIder than you
and there are certain things--

She is in just as shitty
a relationship as you.

Stop justifying this.

We aII know your husband--
Fine! I fucked him.

I paid him.

But I was just trying
to help him out.

He's a decent kid
who was haVing a hard time.

So why don't you want
to heIp out your kid again?

What is the big deaI?

It was a mistake, Judy.

Oh, pIease.
It's a mistake?

Are you kidding me? It's a mistake now that we
want to have some fuckin' fun?

But with you it wasn't
a mistake, right?

Right. No.

AIison.
Mary.

I think it sounds
inVigorating.

You know what?
Let's just set it up for us.

And we'll find
some new girIs for Sam.

What?

I need this.
We need this.

Come on.
You know, I don't know about this.

Oh shut up, Mary. When was
the Iast time someone fucked you

so hard you couIdn't waIk?
Oh my God.

Jesus fucking Christ, Judy.

You know, now that
l think about it,

I think it sounds
really fun!

Are they fit?
Fit

and they are wiIIing.

lt's so true.
There is nothing sweeter

than a boy's worship
of the femaIe body.

Excuse me.
Who are you again?

Oh, this is Dominica, darIing.

to pay for my tuition--

um...

that money that we
puIIed together was dirty.

AII right.

So what I'm basicaIIy
trying to tell you

is that we started
an escort service

that catered to your wife
and all of her friends.

And I swear to God
l had no idea

that it was your--

that it was your wife.
And her friends

were aII just fuckin'--

once this whoIe thing
started, man,

I couIdn't stop it.
I reaIIy reaIIy--

it was going
just reaIIy weII

and then you came
and you told me

that you got the schooI
to pay for my-- my tuition

and I feIt awfuI.

I just feIt fuckin' awfuI.

And I wanted to teII you about it,
but l couldn't.

I didn't teII you about it,

so then I went to the rentaI house
where we wouId,

you know, do everything
and l tried to stop it.

But I didn't stop it there because I figured,
"What the fuck?

One night. One night.
One more time.

Let's have one more time.
We'II go one more time."

But it's not gonna be
one more time.

Even if you hadn't caught us,
it wasn't gonna be one more time.

And the onIy reason
you didn't catch me

was 'cause I was out
alone with your--

I was at your house--
your house!

--with your
fuckin' daughter.

Post script: I had no idea
it was your daughter,

but...

I tried to come cIean
with her.

And...

l don't know, man.
I'm just reaIIy fuckin' Iost.

And l know
that you're probabIy

just super pissed

and you don't care,

but...

Are you roIIing a joint?

I'm Iistening.

You're not even mad?

Kinda.

Nah, not reaIIy.

No.

Come on, man.
I knew what was going on.

You did?
Huh?

You did?
WeII, of course I did.

Find all your buddies
with a bunch of oIder women?

And magicaI cash?

l mean, l'm stupid,
but I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

And you know what?
You said it.

You didn't fuck my wife.

You didn't know Courtney
was my daughter.

And you did what you needed
to do to stay here.

So now what?
Now what what?

You gonna kick me
out of school?

Nah.
Your friends?

They took the heat for you.

Anyway, you know what?

You'Ve been kicked out
of too many schooIs.

So l told
the new headmaster that--

Whoa, hang on. What do you mean
new headmaster?

Oh yeah.

I resigned this morning.

The new headmaster
is English.

I hear he wears bow ties.

So,

if you do stay here,

your schoIarship is safe.

Look, man,
thank you, but...

I have absoIuteIy
no interest

in staying here,

I mean without you
or my friends, so...

I figured as much.

You know what?
You're gonna be aII right.

l don't know about that.
No, you're gonna be aII right.

I know.

ReaIIy.

So what are you gonna do
about your family?

WeII...

that famiIy--
my famiIy's had probIems

for a long time
way before you came.

And Judy and I, weII,

we were done years ago.

Shawn.

He's a troubIed kid.

I feeI responsibIe
for aII that troubIe he has.

But that's the gift
a father giVes a son--

resentment and scorn.

He'II be aII right.

He'II come around
like when he's 29.

And that IittIe girI of mine?

l don't worry
about her one bit.

She has got it aII, man.

Got it aII, that girI.

So what about you?
Me?

WeII, me--

can I ask you a question?

Yeah.

SeriousIy.

You think l'm too old
to go back on the road?

Nah.
Just wrap it up.

Oh, I'm gonna
doubIe-bag it.

Oh yeah. I ain't
making that mistake again.

Hey, do a bro
a soIid, wiII you?

Yeah, man.

You take JetBlue
out of Ontario home tonight?

Okay.

Good.

AII right.

Remember...

heroes aren't born,

they're cornered.

Bukowski?
Mickey Rooney.

Come on,
get out of here.

Oh.

That's good.

Oh, I pIay so good
when l'm high.

' Everything's gonna be aII right '

' Everything's
gonna be aII right '

' Everything's gonna
be aII right now '

' Everything's gonna
be aII right, oh-oh. '

Excuse me. Sorry, man.

Hi.

Hey, you need some heIp?
Sam?

Worst opening Iine eVer.

So what are you doing
taking my fIight home?

Your fIight, huh?

WeII, if you must know,
l'm going to be living

with my dad's parents
in The ViIIage

for the Iast year
and a haIf of high schooI.

I hear they're eccentric
artists, so that's cooI.

That's cooI.

You reaIIy don't haVe
to heIp me with that. It's fine.

Look, yes I do.

By the way, how the heII do you pIan
on getting aII these bags past security?

I'm crafty.
Crafty?

lf you'd like to ensure
safe passage of your bags,

then maybe you shouId
Iet me take one.

We can just say
we're together.

Okay.

lt's cool.
It's my bag.

Yeah, maybe, you know.

Okay.

Okay.
Maybe's okay.

Thanks.

So...
So...

What's your
reaI story, SamueI?

Got fiVe hours to kiII?

' As I swim to shore
through these raging seas '

' I don't know how,
but I know I'm free '

' There's a IittIe road
I used to waIk '

' It's about the same,
the same as it was '

' I know I'II see her eyes again '

' So, good Lord, take me away '

' Show me your smiIing face '

' I don't have much to say '

' But I'II say thank you '

' And, good Lord, giVe me a sign '

' Maybe I'II find it in this bottIe of wine '

' I don't have much to say '

' But I'II thank you... '

' And there's a IittIe bird
singing in my tree '

' I don't know what he's saying '

' But I know he's free '

' Sometimes we faII fast asIeep '

' And other times we awake '

' I know I'II see her eyes again '

' So, good Lord, take me away '

' Show me your smiIing face '

' I don't haVe much to say '

' But I'II say thank you '

' And, good Lord, giVe me a sign '

' Maybe I'II find it in this bottIe of wine '

' I don't haVe much to say '

' But I'II thank you '

' Good Lord, take me away '

' Show me your smiIing face '

' I don't have much to say '

' I don't have much to say. '
