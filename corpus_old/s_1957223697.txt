(telephone ringing)

[Operator] 911.
What's your emergency?

[Man] I, I, I, I
don't, I don't know.

I, I'm, I just got home and
my front door is wide open

and there's, there's,
there's blood everywhere.

Billy, you stay there.
Do not come in here!

[Operator] Sir, can you
see anyone injured inside?

[Man] I don't, I don't
know! I don't know!

My, my wife, she's
here, I know she's here,

but I can't find her.

[Operator] Sir,
listen carefully.

I need you to leave
the house now.

Do you understand?
Step out of the house.

[Man] Oh my God. Oh my God.

No, no, no!

Sir. Sir.
No!

[Operator] Emergency
vehicles are on their way.

[Man] Oh my God, no!

Sir.
No.

(ominous music)

(elevator dings)

No.

No, I didn't talk to him.

Because he was on call today.

No, I don't know his
schedule, you psycho.

know. He's very cute.

Hmm? Mm, not really.

Uh, no. I'm good, actually.

I also have that
pizza in the freezer,

so I can just make that.

Are you serious? I was gonna...

Fine. Fine, I'll
go to the store.

Do you want anything?


Yeah, I wonder why.

Maybe because you ate my pizza.

(suspenseful music)

(woman screams)

(ominous music)

(heartbeat thumping)

(eerie music)

(waves crashing)

Baby.
Hey.

How's it going?

(sighs) Well, I haven't
smashed my laptop yet,

so I feel like it's
a moral victory.

Oh, that's good.
Yeah.

(groans) I don't
know, I think maybe

I should stay here this
weekend and work on it.

Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

Wait, what? No.

The deadline is Monday.

No, forget that.

I have-
No, there's no way.

We're going. We're going.

Oh my God. Oh, I'm so tight.

Oh, you are, uh,
are kind of tense.

Uh-huh. (laughs)

How can you tell?

Well, you know, I'm a doctor.

I'm trained in these matters.

(woman laughs)
I know where

all the parts are.

(laughs) Do you have
a cure for me, Doctor?

(laughs) I do.
I do have a cure.

Maybe I'll whip
up a cure for you.

Ah, okay.
Let's put you like this.

This is all very scientific

with pressure
points and chakras-

I see.
And things like that.

Uh-huh.
Feel that?

Uh-huh.
Oh, that feels good.

(woman giggles)

(crickets chirping)

(woman moaning)

Oh, yeah. (moans)

Oh, baby. (moaning)

(twig snaps)

What was that?
Okay, babe, don't stop.

Come on!
Okay. (moaning)

Okay, don't stop.

(woman panting)

Somebody out there?

(fire crackling)

Go check.

Oh, come on.
Babe, go check.

Fuck!

I can't believe this shit.

(woman gasps)
Okay, bro.

Game's over. You've
had your fun.

Fucking pervert.

â™ª Hey

â™ª Hey

(cell phone chiming)

Good afternoon, this is Blake.

Are you trying to kill me?

Karlie just told me that
you're going out of town.

Decaf.

Please tell me that you're
smoking too much weed.

I just need a couple
days for a little R&R.

R&R, honey, can
you say deadline?

Look, I told Roger we'd have
the new pages by Tuesday.

Now, I know I'm a product of
the Los Angeles school system,

but that is five days.

I know. I know.

I just, yeah, I'm just
a little bollixed out.

Bollixed, like the exercise
machine on late night TV

with Chuck what's his name?

Wow. No.

I just, I've got some minor...

I don't know, just
a little block.

Don't you say
it. No, you don't.

You listen to me.
No, you do not.

Listen, come over to my
place, hang out on the couch,

kick back a couple of
martinis, you'll be fine.

As tempting as that sounds
I'm gonna stick to the plan.

But don't worry, you will
have your pages by Monday.

I promise.

Does this plan have anything
to do with the doctor?

Yeah. He's always
part of the plan.

Ugh. Love.

Has he even put
a ring on it yet?

We're taking our time.

Mm, sweet story.

Okay, listen, you go
and get bow-fingered

or whatever it is
you're calling it,

and I wanna make sure
that I have brilliance

on my desk no later
than Monday afternoon.

Stan's on two.
Okay.

All right, I gotta
go, baby doll.

I love you. Bye-bye.

(upbeat music)

â™ª Oh

â™ª Yeah

â™ª Yeah

â™ª I wish that I
could be falling â™ª

â™ª For someone who's got
freckles, hoo, hoo â™ª

â™ª Show me, baby
â™ª Ah

â™ª Show me, baby

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah

â™ª I wish that I
could be falling â™ª

(ominous music)

(shower trickling)

(ominous music)

â™ª 'Cause we look good

â™ª We look fly

â™ª We look happy because
we're all high â™ª

â™ª Like we should

(cell phone chiming)

[Jack] Hey,
cuddle bug. It's me.

Went straight to voicemail,

so I'm guessing
you're getting close.

Yay, cell phone reception
in the mountains. Woo-hoo!

Anyway, the key's under the
bright yellow flower pot

by the door with a big
sign on it that says

"Keys under here in case
you wanna rob this house."

No, I'm just kidding.

There's a cabin next door,
but nobody's ever there.

Fridge is full of food,
but there's no booze.

Giving you a heads up
there. Plan accordingly.

All right, I'll try it later.

Love you. Bye.

â™ª Yeah, the DJ in our head

â™ª Has got us feelin'

(low ominous music)

(suspenseful music)

(traffic whooshing)

(mellow music)

Something.
You sure?

Oh, good afternoon.

Wine.

(chuckles) Pretty
much some pickings,

but what we have is
on the back wall.

Thank you.

(gentle music)

(dog barking)

(dog yelps)

(gentle music)

Not much of a
selection, is there?

(chuckles) No. (laughs)

Shh.

(gentle music)

Oh. Oh.

Is there a party I
wasn't invited to?

I'm sorry?

Oh, no, just stocking
up for the weekend.

Okay. For a moment there,
my feelings were hurt.

So, uh, you staying up this way?

Yeah. Yeah, my
boyfriend's family's cabin.

Much needed peace and
quiet for a couple days.

Oh, yeah? Which cabin is that?

Really angling for
that party invite, huh?

I'm sorry. We're
really nosy up here.

Oh, no. I'm sorry.

It's big city manners, right?

The Conrad cabin in Northdale.

(ominous music)

35.47.

Oh, uh, okay.

Thanks.

You be careful up there.

I mean, there's not much
in the way of humans

this time of year, if
you know what I mean.

Well, you know,
I'm counting on that,

so you know what I mean.

(both laugh)
Yeah.

Well, it was nice
chatting with you.

You, too.

Sam.

Mind your own business, Dina.

We don't know nothing
about nothing yet.

You shoulda told her.

(traffic whooshing)

(ominous music)

(birds chirping)

(majestic music)

(dramatic music)

(cell phone chiming)

Hi there.

Hey, I got you.

[Blake] Yes. Yes, you have.

Wasn't sure if I'd reached you

with the shitty cell
service up there.

Well, lucky me. My
GPS says three miles.

Oh, wow. You're almost there.

Welcome to Northdale. Really?

Home of the, uh, I don't know
what they're the home of,

but it's ours for the weekend.

Oh, I can't wait.

I wish you were coming tonight.

Oh, me, too.

After this fucking week. Brutal.

Come to me, babe.
I'll make it all better.

Yeah, I'm aware
of your skillset.

It's what gets me
through the day.

Hey, but look at it this way.

You're gonna have a whole
day to work on the book. Yay!

Ugh, God, I have no
interest in writing

for three-year-olds anymore.

They're stupid. They lack
all thought and reason.

Aw, you're gonna make a
wonderful mother someday.

(Blake laughs)

(birds calling)

(insect buzzing)

(ominous music)

You got my message, right?

Yes. Yes, thank you.

I would've died without wine.

Wow.
Stop. You know what I mean.

I do. You're a
snot-flying drunk.

Hey, I think I'm here.

It's nice, right?

What? The front door is open.

(cell phone crackling)

Jack?
Hello?

Blake!

Jack?

Shit.

(ominous music)

Hello?

Is there anybody here?

Hello?

Is somebody out there?

(suspenseful music)

(papers slam)
(woman gasps)

Ah!
For reals?

Payback's a bitch.

You look tired.

That's because I am.

ER 8 is open.
Take a quick nap.

Oh, that sounds so good.

Thank you. Another whole pile.

Um, yeah, that'd be good
because Blake would kill me

if I slept all weekend.

Oh, that's right.
This is the big weekend.

Nervous?
No.

Maybe a little.
Don't be.

You have nothing to worry about.

You're two peas in a pod.

Oh, that's really corny.

But thank you.

Should probably hang
on to these, Heather.

I have a nap to do.

Wake me in an hour!

Sure thing.

Why not?

(crickets chirping)

(ominous music)

(suspenseful music)

(tinkling music)

(suspenseful music)

(birds chirping)

(faint background chattering)

Hmm?

Some, uh, interesting reading.

My wife gets 'em, and
then she quizzes me.

Your secret's
safe with me, sir.

Is there something
I can help you with?

It's talking about
this. Just came in.

(ominous music)

Northdale.
Yep.

Isn't that where-
Uh-huh.

(dramatic music)

[Blake] Hi, this is
Blake. Leave me a message.

(phone beeps)

Baby! Hey, I'm on my way.

I gotta make a quick little
stop at the hospital.

I promise I'm in
and out two minutes.

And then I'm coming after you.

Can't wait to see you.
You better not be smoking.

Just leave me alone!

(rock thudding)

(dramatic music)

(Blake screams)

Oh my God! Oh my God!

(dramatic music)

(Blake whimpering)

Hello? Come out!

Help! Is anybody home?

Please? Hello, hello?

Hello? Help, help!

Hello? Anybody?

Hello, is anybody home?

Oh.

Excuse me, sir!

Sir, can you help-

(cell phone chiming)

(Blake whimpering)

(ominous music)
(cell phone chiming continues)

Blake?

Hello? Baby, can you hear me?

Blake? Hello?

(phone ringing)

Hey, baby. I lost you for a-

(man grunting)

(phone ringing)

[Blake] Hi, this is
Blake. Leave me a message.

(phone beeps)

(ominous music)

Fuck it.

Call Anza Sheriff's Department.

(phone ringing)

Oh, no, no.

I'll get it.

Sheriff Logan.

Hi, this is Dr. Jack Conrad.

I'm calling because I'm
hoping I can get someone

to do a wellness check for me.

Is this a medical emergency?

Uh, I don't, I don't know.

Really it's more of a
gut feeling, I guess.

It's, it's, it's my fiance,
well, my, my girlfriend.

Her name's Blake Sinclair,
and she's up there alone,

and I have not been able
to get in touch with her.

Cell phone service around
here is sketchy at best.

Drives us nuts.

Oh, no, I know, I get it.

But there's something,
something strange here

because I, I've, I've
called several times

and it's always gone
straight to voicemail.

And the last time I called,
someone picked up the phone.

I mean, I could,
I could hear them.

It was like, someone was there,
I could hear 'em listening,

but no one talked, and
then it disconnected.

I called right back,
and then it sounded like

someone was smashing
the phone or something.

Okay. What's her location?

Well, she's up in Northdale
at my family's cabin.

Northdale?
Yeah. Yeah.

It's about four
miles out of town

off the Douglas Pine Highway.

Stand by Doctor.

Talley!

Get in here.

Doctor, what's your address
up there in Northdale?

[Jack] 31 South Sycamore.

31 South Sycamore.

Is this the number
I can reach you on

with the 479 area code?

Yeah, yeah, that's my cell.
I'm on my way up there now.

We're about an
hour from there.

I'll send a patrol car
up there to take a look.

(sighs) Thank you.
Appreciate that.

Like I said, I don't know
why this is bugging me.

It's more of a gut
feeling, I guess, but-

Sometimes those
are the best kind.

Drive carefully.
[Jack] Thanks.

Northdale?
Yeah, Northdale.

It's a pretty popular
place as of late.

Yeah, I have to
agree with you on that.

So many things going missing.

Why don't you take a
little ride up there

and poke around a bit?

Copy that.

(Blake sobbing)

Jack! Open the
door, open the door!

Open the door! Oh, oh, Jack!

Oh, God, we gotta
get outta here!

There's a man, and
he was in the house.

We gotta get, oh my God!

(Blake screaming)

(Blake sobbing)

No!

Why are you doing this?

Why are you doing this?

(suspenseful music)

(Blake sobbing)

(crickets chirping)

(indistinct radio chatter)

That's weird.
Talley!

Talley!

Go, Sheriff.

You've gotta make it
over to the Conrad house.

We haven't heard from him
and he's not picking up.

Something's not right.

On my way.

I wanna hear something the
minute you hear something.

You got that?

Yes, sir.

And Lynn.
Sir?

Don't piss me off.

Watch your back.

Copy that.

[Man On Radio]
Multiple bodies.

[Man] Okay, so
here's where we're at.

We had a chance to
read the new material

over the weekend.

Well?

[Man] And well, it's
quite the departure.

And?
Well, we love it.

Of course you do
'cause she's a genius.

Uh, who would've thought
that we would've gotten

a book like this out
of Blake Sinclair?

I did. That's who.

[Man] Well, of
course you did, Nina.

Is there a title yet?

"The Survivor."

[Man] Okay, well, uh,

we will go with a major
release here in the U.S.,

and then we will blitz

the international market
with translations.

Hey, Mr. Means.
Hey, Penny, come on in.

Honey, we gotta

How you doing?

Good.
Great.

How's your mom?
She's good.

Thank you.
Oh, good.

Babe, we gotta go.

I don't know why
you have to watch

every single trailer
all the time.

I like the trailers.

Oh, hi, Penny.

Oh, you look so cute.
Thank you.

How's your mom?

We gotta go.
She's good. Thanks.

We gotta go.
Okay, so Ashley's asleep,

so you are all good there.

And there's food in the
fridge, so just help yourself.

Oh, you have our number, right?

Honey, she's had our
number for two years.

[Mrs. Means] Don't
be a smart ass.

You guys go. Have a good time.

We will try.

And just don't
put the TV too loud.

All right.
See ya.

Bye.

Scared.

Scared? What?

The Monster Man.

There are no such thing
as monsters. I promise.

Back to bed.

Your mom will kill me
if you're not asleep

when they get home.

Ashley, you're shaking.

You promise there
is no monsters?

That's right. There
are no monsters.

Then who's that?
