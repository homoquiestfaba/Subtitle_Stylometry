MAN: It's a beautiful day.

["BLESSED ASSURANCE" PLAYS]

It's a beautiful day.

It's God's good day.
It's a beautiful day.

You know, standing up for God,
it's not an easy thing.

Nobody said it was easy.
It is not easy.

But Jesus, Jesus saved my life.

He saved my life.

I relate it to David,
the psalmist, who said:

Thou hast picked me up
from the dunghill

and placed my feet
on a solid rock.

And Jesus,

Jesus, he lifted me up
from a horrible pit as well,

and he washed my heart clean,
and he cleaned me up

from all my sins
and all the evil that I did.

I'm all cleaned up,
and it's a wonderful feeling.

It is wonderful.

And he gave me this message.
He gave me this message to give to you today.

And today, he says:

Go, ye, unto all the world
and spread the gospel,

for he who believes
and is baptized will be saved.

Amen. Amen.

Oh, please,
you're a lot of help.


I was hoping for a little help
myself. I got this problem, lady.

Oh, yeah? Somehow your
problems become my problems.

Shoo. I got a runt in the oven.
I've got work to do.

You do?
Yeah, I do.

Me too.
Ha, ha.

Mm. That tickle?
Stop it, don't tickle there.


I told you don't do that.
Careful, honey. Careful, honey.

Careful, honey.

Ooh. Ooh, ooh.
Ha-ha-ha.

CW: Hop on there, squirt.
There you go.

And get that other one. There you go.
Now, arms real straight.

Now, pick her up

Oh, boy. I got you.

[CORINNE GROWLS]

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

[DOOR OPENS]

Hello.

Good afternoon, ma'am.
Let me introduce myself.

Name's Bobbie Lee Moore,
Syracuse Accordion Company.

I'd like to show you an instrument to
bring magic into your little one's life.

How'd you like
to play the squeezebox?

This here is the Titano
Palmer-Hughes Grand.

It has all the features
of a full-size accordion.

Forty-one full-length black
and mother-of-pearl keys,

all your sharps,
all your flats.


Now it's your turn.

KATHLEEN: I'm sorry, but
she's not really musical.

I wouldn't wanna
waste your time.

Not to contradict you, but maybe
she hasn't found her instrument.

[PLAYING "MARY HAD
A LITTLE LAMB"]

[PLAYING "YANKEE DOODLE"]

SALESMAN: Wow.
Look at the way you squeeze that box.

What do you think of
the Titano Palmer-Hughes Grand?

It's practically
bigger than she is.

She can barely
stand up straight.


SALESMAN:
Okay.

[GASPS THEN GROANING]

Mama.

KATHLEEN: Oh, darling.
I love you. I love you.

Everything is going
to be all right.


We'll see you in church
on Sunday?

Yes, ma'am.

PASTOR BUD: Oh, it's hot today
here in Vacation Bible School.

Just nod your head
if you're hot today. Yes?

Do you know the Lamb of God?
Do you know that he is knocking

at the door of your heart?

So gentle the way he does it.

Just... so soft.

Gently. Tap, tap, tap.

Can you hear it?

[PASTOR BUD
TAPPING MICROPHONE]

Can you hear him there?
Jesus is a gentleman, children.

He's not gonna come barging into
your heart without an invitation.

Won't you open the door
for Jesus?

Want you to take
that chain off your door

and lift up that latch

and open that up.

Who's there? It's Jesus.

And he's waiting for you, children.

You're welcome here, dear Lord.

All right, let us
bow our heads and pray.

With everyone's eyes closed now,
no one looking around,

raise your hand
if you made a decision today.

Yes, Pastor Bud,

I opened the door.
I didn't leave Jesus out in the cold.

I wanna go to heaven.

[CHILD SNORTS]

No pig snorting, please.

Little children, this is the time
now to make the decision.

I see you. Does anyone else
think this is the...?

I see you, dear.

Is there anybody else today
who will raise your hand and say:

"This is my day."

To say, "I've been saved."

I see you, dear child.

I see you, sweetheart.
I see you, I see you.

Tim, Corinne, Shelly.
I'll speak to you up here.

Everyone else, as you head out,

do be careful on those steps.
Won't you?

Happy summer.

["HOW GREAT THOU ART" PLAYS]

Now,

I want you to know

what a great day it is
in heaven right now.

Do you know why?

Because we asked Jesus
into our heart?

Hearts, moron.

Because you made
the best decision of your lives.

Put your hands together.

You've made the best
decision of your lives.

Don't be ashamed
of Jesus, children,

and he won't be ashamed of you.

I want you to tell your mama
and your papa

that your names have
been written in the book of life.

[KATHLEEN SIGHS]

Oh, Kathleen, Kathleen.

All right.
Is it hot enough for you?

I might join my girls
at the pool this afternoon.

Oh, Bathsheba bathing, well...

You like to swim, Pastor Bud?

Oh, I never learned to swim, I...

His power is perfected
in my weakness in that way.

I used to be a lifeguard.

You didn't.
I could teach you.

No.
I could.

I could teach you,
yes, I could.

PASTOR BUD: No, I would
just sink like a stone.

<i>You know, the baptism tank,
that's as deep as I could go.</i>

<i>KATHLEEN: Ha-ha-ha.
PASTOR BUD: Never mind about that.</i>

Corinne has some wonderful
news to share with you.

Really, sweetheart?
And Kathleen?

Yes.
I know this has not been

an easy time since you
lost your baby, I know that.

But the Lord can make good
things come out of tragedy.

Your family will be strong now with
God at the center. You know that.

All right, you tell your mama
the good news.

Bye.

Come on, Pookie.
Come on, Wendy.

Let's go swimming, huh?

Okay, so,
what's the wonderful news?

Hm?

What is it?

She got saved today.
Saved from what?

I just raised my hand,
that's all.

Pastor Bud says Jesus knocks on
our heart, but we don't listen.

Maybe he should try
the doorbell instead.

KATHLEEN: Sally saw you.
CW: What? Sally saw me what?

What, what? What did Sally see?
KATHLEEN: I can't trust you.

CW: You can't trust me?

KATHLEEN:
You're making me crazy, all right?

You're making me crazy. I am home.
I am the one who's home here.

I'm taking care of these children.
I'm in this crap house.

CW: I'm the one who's out working,
buying your wigs and your car

and your other crap. So, what
is the issue? What did I do?

KATHLEEN: I have made every house
that we have lived in a home.

CW:
Yeah, well, are we...?

KATHLEEN:
Follow around all your crap.

CW:
Yeah, yeah, it's all about me.

What?

CW: All alone.
Yeah, you made us a house, sure, sure.

CW: What is the problem?
What do you want me to say?

KATHLEEN:
Right now, what isn't the problem?

Yeah.

You see how big that guy was?
Jesus Christ.

Hey, guys, I'll catch you in a second.
All right.

Hey. You're the writer,
aren't you?

I write. I mean...
Yeah, you're Corinne Walker, right?

Yeah.
Yeah.

I was just on my way to practice.
Do you know The Renegades?

Uh, of course.
Everyone knows The Renegades.

I'm Ethan.

I know.

So, what are you doing?

Um, I'm waiting for my sister
to finish practice.

I meant, what are you writing?

Oh.

Some words and thoughts.

Thoughts on what?
Mm, disappointment.

Oh.

We should
write a song together.

For The Renegades?

Sure. Yeah. But, um...

I'm not musical.

Maybe you haven't found
your instrument yet.

Just tell her you love her.

Hm? Where do you think you're...?

It's devastating.

They come in for counseling?

I met with them a few times,
but the damage had already been done.

Their marriage was weakened

What kind of sexual issues?
I don't wanna go into that right now.

I like that.

That one always makes me
wanna dance for the Lord.

[ALL CHUCKLING]

Uh, listen, before we start,
I wanna welcome, uh...

Sorry, where did she go?
Corinne's sister, Wendy.

Let's give a warm welcome.

[ALL APPLAUDING]

Uh, now, let's give
a hot hand clap for Jesus.

[ALL WHOOPING
AND APPLAUDING]

Listen, before we start,
I wanna, uh...

I wanna open up the floor
to the body of believers.

If anybody has anything
they wanna share.

Anything that's on their hearts.

To edify the saints. Anybody?

No?

Okay.

CORINNE:
Yeah, um...

I was praying with a sister
for her rebellious child

and, um...

after we asked God for help,

we thanked him
for answering our prayers

because he will answer it,
you know?

As we're told in Thess...
Thess... Thess...

My, that is a tongue twister.
In, uh, Thessalonians, um...

Hold on.

As we're told in Thessalonians,
uh, you know,

God wants us to come to him
with all our needs and all our desires.

If you want the Ganders
to have a winning season.

If you want it, you know...

It'll take a miracle.

But I'll pray anyway.

And then I'll thank him when
they choke in the fourth quarter

like they always do.
But that's faith, isn't it?

Isn't that what makes us
different from the world?

That we believe
even though we don't see?

Faith is the substance
of things hoped for,

the evidence of things not seen.
You can sit down now.

That's what it says in Hebrews, right?
Thank you.

Uh, I see you have been
hitting your Bible studies.

God bless you.

Power of the holy word.

Uh, I don't know
who you were praying with.

And you know what?
I don't have to know.

It's okay, but I just wanna say, if
that woman wants to come to me directly

uh, or any of the elders
of the church,

we'd be privileged to sit down
and pray with her, okay?

Um, does anybody have a burden
on their heart they wanna share?

Ned, go ahead.

What's on your mind, brother?
NED: Uh, a couple things.

Sister?

Yeah. I'm sorry.

You came very close
to preaching just now.

We have to be so careful not to appear
as though we're teaching the men.

No. I didn't mean to.
I know. I know.

And you were so sincere
and I know your heart.

And I know you wanna
submit to God in all ways.

Of course, that's all I wanna do.
I know. I know.

Okay, of course.
Good.

Okay.

Hmm. Come on.
Come on, Holy Spirit.

Come on.

I will love you, Father God.

Oh, Holy Spirit.

Thank you, Lord.

Oh. Father God.

Come on in.

Come on.

[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]

Come on, Lord.
Come on, Holy Spirit.

Just wash down on me, Lord.
Just...

<i># Come in thy strength
And thy power #</i>

Get thee behind me.

<i># Come in thine own
Gentle way ##</i>

[EXHALES DEEPLY]

[SPEAKS GIBBERISH
THEN GROANS]

Try later.

Wend?
Yep.

I have a system.

Okay, what's your system?

Look at the edges.
Right.

Half.
Mm-hm.

Half.
Right.

Thirds.
Oh.

Look.
Okay.

Okay, okay, okay.

Half.

Half, thirds.
I'm doing it with the wrist.

Half. Ow. Ha-ha-ha.

I'm doing the towels.

LILY:
Hi, Brownie. Hi, Spotty.

What you doing, Spotty?
What you doing, Brownie?

Mm. Are you hungry?
Are you hungry?

You have a stomachache?

You say "yes."

You say "no."

Oh, my God. What is this?
My undies.

Ha-ha-ha. What is this?
Why?

How do you...? What is...?
How do you wear this?

What is this? Ha, ha!
How do you wear this?

How do you fold this thing? Ha, ha!
Half. Half.

Thirds.
Okay.

Okay, half. Half.

We're going into
origami territory.

Hold on, what could this be?

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

ETHAN: Hey, Lily,
what are you doing?

What are you...?

Hey. Come on.

Come on, honey.

Come on.

Wendy!

Hey!

Okay, okay.
Get that out of my house!

CORINNE: What is this?
Give it to me.

Do you see this?

Look at me, hon.
No, no, no.

We're answerable to God.
I'm not giving it back.

It's not yours. It's not mine.
I don't use that.

Who has drugs
but doesn't use them?

I'm holding it. I'm a safe house.
We gave you a safe house.

Come on.
Don't look at me like that.

Come here. You put it in your mouth?
No.

You sure? Drink.
LILY: Mm-hm.

ETHAN:
Let's do it.

CORINNE:
Drink, okay? Drink.

What are you doing?
CORINNE: Face.

Get right with God, Wendy.
Shit.

It's not for me!

What? Peace, righteousness?
Eternal life?

Which one is not for you?

I don't want your life, Corinne.
I'll take my fucked-up one instead.

Scrub, scrub.
