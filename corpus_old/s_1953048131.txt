Colony Collapse Disorder
is the bill we're getting,

for all we have done to the bees.

It's just a name that was given to a
phenomenon that a hive is found empty.

Food is there, honey is there,
but the bees are gone.

The first thing we look for is
who is the cause for that?

Who is responsible?

We are not going to solve
the problem by us killing

a virus or bacteria or fungi,

because the problem is an inner one.

Personally, I am grateful for a crisis,

the crisis will give us the
possibility to learn something

if we are willing.

If the heart opens up enough
to tell the mind something.

If we didn't have bees to
pollinate our crops, you know,

we'd have to eat just bread
and oatmeal all the time,

and a couple of nuts!

The honeybee is important because

a tremendous amount of what we eat.

So that's to say 4 of every 10
bites of food you consume,

you would not consume if not
for the work of the honeybee.

We have lost in this country alone, in
America, about five million colonies

each one of them having 20 to 50, 60
thousand individual honeybees.

The bees are always telling
us all kinds of things

that we have to learn, they
are giving us messages

and their crisis is our crisis definitely.

We could call it Colony Collapse
Disorder of the human being too.

The honeybee was
considered a sacred animal.

And the sacredness came out of
that knowledge that the honeybee

is one of the great
nurturers of life and fertility.

The honeybee came out
of the mystery centers.

Places where there were
initiates and leaders of mankind

who guided and impulsed and inspired
the various civilizations that we have.

The ancient Indian,

the ancient Persian,

the Greco-Roman civilization,

the Egyptian, Babylonian civilization.

If you think

that they opened up the
tombs of Tutankhamen

and honey that was 2000
years old is still edible...

There is a reverence to bees.
There is also a reverence to the gods.

Now, don't you think in some way that
we should actually be revering them

because they're actually keeping us alive,

as opposed to the other way around?

They're absolutely beautiful creatures.

They're God's creatures and
if we don't protect them

then we're not protecting ourselves.

Look. There they go.

Honey was considered so
sacred as a gift from the bees.

The honey was not sold until the end
of the 19th or into the 20th century.

Most of the honey was
given away as a gift.

It is one of the most beneficial
and healing substances

that we can imagine.

It has enzymes, it has nutrients,
it has trace minerals

and it has forces of the
hexagonal, the silica forces in it.

And silica is a substance
in the earth's mantle.

About half of the earth's mantle is silica.

The silica in us is mainly
in the sense organs.

It is the sensing for what
goes on in the surrounding.

So the silica and the honey

have a beneficial influence
on our evolution.

Mainly from the 19th century on

we have gone into controlling
nature more and more.

And we have lost that
feeling for sacredness.

Steiner gave lectures to the workers
at the Goetheanum in 1923

and Steiner said, "'Yes,

this mechanization of beekeeping,

this realm of life is becoming
mechanized and industrialized

and that will eventually
destroy beekeeping

and the honeybee might not
survive the end of the century.

That is the 20th century.

So, now with the Colony
Collapse Disorder

it's clear that Steiner's
prediction has come true.

And as Steiner said that

"'Our very lives depend on beekeeping.

Everybody should be
interested in beekeeping.

Our lives depend on it!"

Look at the beautiful honey.

So I feel that we are seeing
changes in climate

but I think the Colony Collapse Disorder
and the disappearance of the honeybee

is a much more pressing,
urgent problem to solve.

A lot of rationalization, a lot of
mechanizationhas gone into beekeeping

to make it profitable.

And that has brought down
the honeybee in its vitality,

in its health.

It's financial. It's financial!

We're accepting things that
aren't ideal for the bees

because we have to for
the business that we're in

and we're in the business
to stay in business,

so we have to do it!

You're going to take ten! He's going to
take fourteen when you're done here!

We are a mobile industry.

We run hundreds of thousands
of miles every year.

Without the almond growers and the high
price we would never have survived.

The almond crop is our fastest growing,

most profitable export
crop here in California.

Every February, just
around Valentines Day,

has become the single greatest
pollination event in the world.

Bees from the entire country,
as far away as New England

and Wisconsin and
Minnesota and Florida

get on trucks in the middle of the winter

and three quarters of all bees in America

come to California to perform
this absolutely critical act,

where they have to be woken up,

strengthened with high
fructose corn syrup.

I mean if there's anything
more viscerally offensive,

it's the idea of feeding the creators
of honey high fructose corn syrup.

When we feed the corn syrup

we hope that's there's enough natural

nectar and honey on the hive

to supplement whatever feed
they get out of the syrup.

There is a 600,000-acre monoculture
of almonds in the central valley.

The problem is that every one of those
trees, every one of the blossoms

needs a bee to visit it.

Yet if there is nothing but
almonds in the central valley,

there is nothing to eat for the
bees for the 50 weeks of the year

that the almonds aren't in bloom.

So there essentially are no bees around.

It's not sustainable.

Two or three years ago there were
not enough bees in America

to pollinate the whole crop

so the USDA gave permission
to import bees from Australia.

Now, as it happened, Australian
bees harbor certain viruses

that are unfamiliar to American bees.

Israeli Acute Paralysis
Virus is one of those.

We brought that in to
pollinate the almonds.

That's where all the
bees of America mixed.

We've created this great Bee Bordello

as one beekeeper put it.

We constantly intermix
from all over the country,

so if they've got something
in one part of the country

like tracheal mite

and we don't have it in
our part of the country,

we certainly will have it

because the migratory
nature of beekeeping

spreads all these pests
at a very rapid rate!

We don't have a single event

that causes the bees to go way down hill.

It's a little bit here and a little bit there.

These semi-load trips I believe
cause huge stress on them.

Once the hive starts getting
stressed to a certain point

then it can no longer cope with
many of these other things

and that extra stress is just
enough to put it over the edge.

So many of the problems we
face come down to one thing

and that is monoculture.

There are many attractions
to monoculture, it's efficient,

but from the point of view
of nature it's... it's insane.

And monocultures are the reason
that the bees are struggling.

And monoculture is the
original sin of agriculture.

Now, the trouble with monoculture is it's

an absolute distortion of the
way an ecosystem works.

Because what you do
with a monoculture is

you take your vibrant
eco-system, you destroy it...

then you put all... put in place
all the things you just took out.

So instead of having natural
fertilizers in the soil

you add inorganic fertilizers,

instead of allowing a natural ecosystem
around pests to develop

you have to use pesticide.

So what's the connection with bees?

As far as the industrial agricultural
corporations are concerned,

the solution that's being offered

is to destroy the insects
that make food possible

and this is the disaster that
they are ready to force on us.

It used to be a continuous
paradise for honeybees

from Pennsylvania all the
way through South Dakota,

the whole northern part of the country,

but now there's just huge... huge
expanses of it are just

monocrops of corn and soybeans.

The fencerows are all gone.

The bees can't even live there

because there's not enough
for the bees to survive on

in a continuous cornfield.
They'll starve to death.

The German beekeepers and our bees

live in a very serious situation.

Every 2 years we have a disaster.

2006, 50%/% of the bee
colonies in America died.

Perhaps in the next years in these areas

where the agriculture is so intensive

could bring us in a situation

that the bees do not find enough
pollen and nectar in the area

for sustaining themselves.

We are in such a habit of exploiting,

of using nature for our own ends

and the honeybees right
now, I think, are saying,

"'If you continue your
ways, I'm withdrawing."

I've been a beekeeper for over 30 years.

I knew something had to be
done to help the honeybees.

And here I was in my retirement.

It was in this moment
of utter hopelessness

I had that feeling of urgency

to start this biodynamic farm

with a bee sanctuary at its heart.

Land had to be found,

people had to be found
to come and help me

and it was not easy.

You go on a great leap of faith and trust.

I came to a moment
where I really doubted

that I could do this alone with my wife

and then at one point things
more or less fell apart.

And it seemed like everything
I had worked for was gone.

Then the bees sort of let me know,

"'Go ahead. We'll help you,"'

and a month later a wonderful
donor came for this purpose

of creating a honeybee sanctuary
on a biodynamic farm.

It's 610 acres

that were maltreated
like the rest of our land.

We are surrounded here in
the heartland by Monsanto.

Farms that are a lot of them
already corporate owned

and with genetically manipulated seed.

These are, for the insect life, deserts

and there is no forage for the bees.

They can't exist there.

So right now we are in this deep crisis

where we have to look at the honeybee
as a patient in the emergency room

and you don't demand of a patient in
the emergency room that they perform

and give you a lot of something.

We are building up here
on Spikenard Farm

a biodynamic farm for the bees.

We are enlivening the soil

and we are enlivening
all that is growing here

and it rays out into the surrounding area.

From early humans on

we were quite touched and impressed
by the way bees can make honeycomb.

And by how exact each cell is shaped.

They are all hexagonal.

The honeycomb is actually
part of their metabolic system.

They sweat out the wax
between their abdominal rings.

Honeycomb like this would
take approximately

one million of those tiny platelets.

The comb is the biggest
inner organ of the beehive.

It's their skeleton;

it's the place they live on.

It is the womb for all of the baby bees.

It's the place where nectar
is processed into honey.

90%/% of their lifespan is happening
on the comb in darkness.

In the beehive

all the individual members dedicate
their lives for the bigger entity

and sometimes I believe that monasteries
are actually imitating a beehive.

There is this formalized
striving for selflessness,

for letting go of ego, for the totality of life.

The workers are all females.

As a colony these 30, 40, 50
thousand female workers

all give up their sexuality,

they do not produce offspring,

and this renunciation of their sexuality,

where they can then take care
of their queen in a wonderful way,

they clean her and they feed
her and they feed each other

and they do that service of
work for the entire colony.

And all of it is for the future, for the health

and the wealth of the colony.

We are entering the innards of this
being right now, at this moment.

This is one whole being.

The biological term is super organism,

something which goes beyond
a single individual organism.

So those 20, 40, the 60 thousand
bees are one undividable entity.

The relationship of bees and flowers
is one of the most beautiful

co-evolutionary relationships we have.

Bees are the legs of plants.

The great existential fact of plant life

is the inability to move.

Being rooted in place.

And the flowers have studied
the preferences of the bees

and learned precisely what patterns,

what smells, what shapes
are most attractive.

So how do you deal with the
need to move your genes

and expand your range?

Well, the genius of flowers was
to recruit bees to do that for them

and bees were their willing collaborators

in their desire to move
their genes around.

One of the great mysteries
of the world I think is

the fact that our taste and bees
coincide to the extent that they do.

These are very different species

but what a bee thinks smells
good, we think smells good

and that's not always true.

There are a lot of plants
that are pollinated by flies

and those plants smell nasty.

Smell like decomposing meat.

Our canons of taste and the
bees are very, very close.

Beauty to a bee is usually
beauty to a human as well.

Industrial farming is based on chemicals.

It's based on chemicals
that came from warfare.

They were designed to kill human beings

but of course they instantly
kill the pollinators.

The tremendous death of
bees that we are seeing

is the pesticides that have
been used very intensely.

It's a much bigger problem
than just agriculture.

The lawns that are sprayed
is so damaging

to so many creatures that
are part of the food chain.

I was with my bees and I
hear a noise of an airplane

and all of a sudden I see that
it is spraying something.

So when I realize that insecticides
or fungicides were being sprayed

if the drift comes over here

my bees are damaged or gone.

When you see an airplane
like that coming and spraying

there is this tremendous feeling
of not being able to do anything.

You're just so vulnerable

and all the bees that are
hit by it are so vulnerable.

These are bees that are a treasure
for me and they are a part of me

and I don't want to lose them.

I really don't want to lose them.

There are many people,
including a lot of beekeepers,

who suspect a relatively
new class of pesticides

might have a role in
Colony Collapse Disorder.

Collectively they are called
the neonicotinoids

and it's true that they are among the
best selling insecticides worldwide.

These neonicotinoids, which are neuro-
toxic, they target the nervous system,

affect the ability of bees to learn

and to remember and to navigate,

all of which would contribute

to an inability to return
to the hive after foraging.

Bees are gleaners.

Bees are particularly vulnerable

because they're really designed
to pick up small particles.

They're built to electro-statically
attract pollen.

We recently discovered with the seque-
ncing of the entire honeybee genome,

honeybees are distinctly lacking enzymes
that break down poisons or toxins.

In Europe bees are completely
dependent on human care and on

human help.

Without this care

many, many bee colonies will die

and only very few will survive
without the help of the beekeepers

and all human beings.

In former times the coal miners

had special birds in the coalmines

and when the canary
birds stopped singing

and stayed silent

it was time for the coal
miners to leave the mountain.

What most people think of
when they think of a pollinator

is they think of the honeybee and the

honey bee is by far the most important
agricultural pollinator we have.

But what a lot of people don't realize is

that we have about 4,000
species of other bees.

Everything from large bumblebees,

thousands of species of bees that
are everything from little bees,

they look like flies, to bright green
florescent almost green -

to striped in different colors.

Bees of all varieties across the world.

Beyond bees, flies and beetles
are very, very important pollinators.

The beauty of the seed

is out of one you can get millions.

The beauty of the pollinator is

it turns that one into the million

and that's an economics of sharing.

That's to me the real
economics of growth

because life is growing.

Without the pollinators
we'd lose the plants.

They're just completely codependent.

The pollinators wouldn't
be there without the plants

and the plants wouldn't be
there without the pollinators.

We've seen a decline
in many of our bees.

With our native bees
we are seeing declines

probably from the same things:

Disease to nutrition to
potentially pesticides

as well as habitat loss.

And the situation is pretty dire

and I think we're just beginning
to realize how dire it is.

But at the same time nature comes up

with all sorts of surprises

and hopefully there will be
some cheering surprises

rather than all gloomy ones.

These little guys run the world.

These guys really are the bosses.

They're doing all of our work for us and
without them we'd be in big trouble.

You take genes from
an unrelated species

and shoot it into the cells of a plant.

And the only two ways you can
introduce unrelated genes

the first is the use of a
gene gun where you shoot

gold particles laden with genes
and put them into the organism.

But it's a very unreliable process

so you also have to add
antibiotic resistance markers.

You also have to add viral promoters

and every genetically
engineered seed is a bundle

of bacteria, toxins, viral promoters.

Genetically modified organisms

are planted in millions of acres
around the United States.

Genetically engineered crops

can compromise the
immune system of bees.

One German scientist found

that when bees collect pollen from corn,

the genes that have been
inserted into the corn end up

transferring into the gut microorganisms
of the bees and continue to function.

Unfortunately, human beings also get
genes transferred to their gut bacteria,

meaning it produces this genetically
engineered bacteria inside of us.

When we start to manipulate
genetic material

we are going to the
very deepest sources,

to the very deepest layers
of the human being.

It allows us to be almost god like.

But the question is:

Do we have the wisdom, the morality,
the depth to do these interventions?

Are we really knowing
what we are doing?

Are we sure that what we do

will not have long-term effects?

And we are not experimenting
here with animals or plants.

We are experimenting
with the human being,

with the soul of human beings,
with the body of human beings.

Nature is very patient for a long
time but there is a moment

when things do collapse
and we have to wake up

but hopefully wake up early
enough to make a change.

I became a beekeeper in 2003 under
rather unusual circumstances.

I had been invited by the
local beekeeping association

to give them a talk on genetic engineering

in relation to bees.

And one of them said,

"Why don't you come
and look at our bees?"'

And then we opened some
beehives and that's what did it.

I was absolutely smitten.

One of the biggest challenges
to beekeepers was the varroa mite,

which is now spread all
over the United Kingdom.

It's a little beast that lives on
the bee and drinks it's blood

and beekeepers have found,

that unless they treat their bees
with chemicals every year,

they will be killed by the varroa mite.

I was taught the conventional
way of beekeeping

and did all the things that
my mentors taught me

which includes putting
chemicals in the hive.

The chemical I started with
was a synthetic pyrethroid

called Apistan.

Clearly one doesn't want that
sort of thing in the honey.

I was going down a road which
didn't really fit with my outlook.

In fact, if you get the dosage wrong

you get bee mortality from the
anti-varroa chemicals that you use.

You are on a kind of treadmill
of putting chemicals in the hives.

You are postponing the day
when the bee adapts to the mite.

In the process of trying to
kill the mites for so long

and using so many chemicals

we're breeding mites that
adapt faster and faster

to every new chemical we throw at them.

This deadly chemical Coumaphos

has no effect whatsoever
on the varroa mite.

In fact, the varroa mites
treated with Coumaphos

did better by some measures

than mites that were not treated.

So in other words, a chemical that
was formerly a deadly poison to them

is now somehow being
used as a resource.

They're becoming stronger and stronger.

We've bred a race of super mites.

I'm keeping the Warré hive to
see if the bees can survive

with varroa without any
intervention with chemicals.

This method of keeping bees
without any chemicals

runs the risk of going
for broke, definitely.

You could lose all your colonies.

But if you are interfering, you are
going against natural selection.

Okay, this is a Darwinian approach.

But the only other alternative is to stay
on the treadmill of giving chemicals

year in, year out, forever.

And in this new type of hive

the bee might be in a better
home to defend itself

against the ravages of the varroa mite.

I'm leaving the bee and the mite,
more or less, to fight it out together.

And that is, I think, the goal in
long-term sustainable beekeeping

is to let bee and mite co-evolve together.

Phil?

Phillip. Can you get me a jar?

There's some beautiful
honeycomb up here.

Thanks Phil.

I'm going to put some
honeycomb in this. Yeah?

Well put it in the bucket
and send it down later.

I was nine when I started beekeeping

and I learned it from my stepfather Ian.

When Phillip first started

he actually pestered me
into keeping the bees.

He, at that point in time, was the
youngest beekeeper in the UK.

Bees have a sort of weird intelligence

and they can do things that humans can't

like walk upside down.

It's kind of the allure of Spiderman

but sort of like the bad bit of Scorpion.

You can, however, feel a little
bit of emotion for the queens

who I have named after the
various queens of England.

Some of the names of the
queens are: Queen Elizabeth the First,

Mary, who was named after Bloody Mary

because she's one of
the most vicious hives.

There's Queen Victoria who
spawns almost all the time

but is fairly stable.

This is what is stress free.

Day at work...

sit down up here, look at my girls.

You see the little antennae?

It's lovely.

She's such a good girl.

Come on. Back you go!

Oh! Look at this!

And this is Hackney in London.

This is what people can do.

People say that they can't
keep bees. They're lying.

And look at that side,
dripping with honey.

All these girlies... yeah,
these girlies here?

...are putting everything
back into the environment.

Not me. I'm just helping them

and I just think it is so rewarding.

The sun lets life be created on earth.

Without the warmth, without the light,

no life would be here.

The bees themselves are sun creatures

and the bees being such
great sun beings,

they are the nurturers of life on earth.

The queen, the most sublime
being in such a hive,

is deeply, deeply connected
with the sun forces.

When the young queen emerges,

when she goes on her marriage flight,

she flies up around 600 feet into the air.

She flies through this swarm of drones

and is mated by up to a dozen drones

so that when she returns, she
has over a million sperm in her

and she can lay millions
of eggs over her lifespan.

And she can lay approximately
1500 to 2000 eggs a day

which is more weight-wise
than her own body weight.

A tremendous feat if you consider that,

that she can lay more than her
own weight in eggs on one day.

I am a queen breeder.
I breed queen bees.

I'm doing this so that I can
be a commercial beekeeper,

so I can make a living from bees.

Each one of those will have a
queen bee hatch out from it.

The problem with bee breeding
has always been this compromise

between inbreeding which is
the way of fixing certain traits

so that an entire line of
queens will all be similar.

But if you push that process too
far it ultimately weakens the bee

and you've lost the vigor

and once you've lost vigor,
you've lost everything.

Modern queen breeding has brought
the quality of the queen down

to a level where the queens
nowadays don't live 4 to 5 years.

They sometimes don't
live even one year.

So they are susceptible
to all kind of illnesses

so now we have to requeen
practically every year

because the queens don't last long.

It's the same with the cow.

The cow, instead of living 20 years,

has a life expectancy of 3 to 4 years.

Not even one guaranteed calf.

There are parallels with bee
breeding and animal breeding.

Chickens' and pigs' genetic stocks
have been just weakened terribly.

They have to be propped up, almost
literally propped up, even to stand up

so they can eat.

That's the direction we're going in.

The biology of honeybees is set up

to avoid inbreeding at all costs

and if bees are inbred for very
long they start to become weaker.

The artificial insemination of queens

is where a young queen, a virgin queen,

is knocked out.

Sperm is squeezed out of some drones

and the queen is artificially inseminated.

The problem I see there is

that in nature the young queen
goes on a marriage flight

and that's actually the health of it.

That the queen will breed

with up to a dozen drones
of different varieties

and here we are creating another,
like a monoculture, one stock

and that stock is good
for a little while and then

it doesn't have the life
forces that is necessary.

In the beehive we can
actually see what happens

if we start to manipulate nature.

For awhile nothing much.

For ten, twenty years it
is possible to do that.

But after 50, 60, 100 years

you can see the effects of such
manipulation very, very clearly.

It's very interesting that in one of Rudolf Steiner's lectures

he recognized very early on,

if we manipulate the bee
civilization on that level

there will be a long-term effect.

And we are reaping the
harvest we have sown.

This image of a queen in a cage
became a prominent image for me

in the play

and the queen represents
for me the soul of the world.

I was looking into this metaphor
of the queen in the cage

and how bees were being
handled in the world today.

There's a queen bee just there.

So, we put her in a cage.

I'll cage up all this one

then I can send her away
and sell her to somebody.

All the queen bees in cages are
being exported to the United States

to build up the colonies in the States.

This has degenerated the whole
strength of the bee colony.

We have to raise queens
again the natural way

and this we have to respect:
That nature is much wiser than we are.

We live with our bees in
the bush, in the forest.

We've moved with them

and you do become very
in tune with nature

when you live with them all the time

and they have got some
magical, magical properties

and magical things they do.
I think some of it rubs off on us.

Did you hear that?

Well, my father was a beekeeper

and his grandfather had a
bit of a fiddle before him,

so I started getting stung
at a pretty early age.

Belting on the lids of the hives
down in the back yard

and my mum... remember my mum telling
me running up to the house screaming

with a head full of angry bees
stinging all out at you.

You just snap a handful off like that.

This gets the smoker going pretty quick.

Just push it down in there a bit
until it gets a little bit going...

and a bit of a puff.

You can smell - smell the honey.

It's a bit odd today.

We don't have the trouble in Australia
yet with the Colony Collapse Disorder

that they seem to be having in America.

So I think you're just creating such a
big toxic load that the bees have had

enough so out the door they go and
go and look for greener pastures.

In West Australia the use of
chemicals is banned for the treatment

of hive diseases and parasites.

As a consequence our
honey is quite pristine

compared to other parts of the world

who have to treat with miticides etc.

Which must in turn leach into the honey
and give you a contaminated product.

This is a bit of fresh
West Australian nectar

right off the wondoo.

It's... mmm... beautiful,

beautiful, sweet, light flavored honey.

Excellent for toast and crumpets and

yeah, could just eat that all day.

Baaaaa!

In New Zealand we have this
fantastic history of beekeeping

because it's very much part
of farming community

that involves beekeepers and
farmers working together

to have a whole agricultural
system that works.

The feeling for nature and for the bees

and that has become very much
connected to my Maori connection.

In old societies the beekeeper
was a very respected person.

He became someone that was revered
and someone that was looked up to

who would bring in this sweetness.

The Maori were very much a
people that would watch nature

and watch insects

and if they would see changes in them,
these changes would mean a lot to them

and they would mean that there would
be changes coming for them as well.

We're hearing stories from America

of bees not coming back to their colony

and for me to think that my children

won't have pollination happening
with their berries

and with their vegetable
patches and food supply,

I find -

I find that really something
that's really affecting my heart.

And I'm really finding out
why I'm beekeeping is

to keep that going
for my children's children.

If bees leave this world I wouldn't like it

because there would be
no honey and no fruit,

because you wouldn't find many
peaches or apples these days then.

My three daughters and my wife are
now coming out into the field with me

and that's an incredibly warming feeling

around the bees is to
have a family business.

It's wonderful that the kids can be
part of the financial business making

and roll candles for the girls to
be able to sell at the market.

And all the wax we make
and it helps us

get some money to look after our ponies,

which are very special to us,
and we really like doing that.

So this is Lace. She's 30 years
old and she loves honey.

She's great! She goes out
and wins competitions

and she's healthy.

She's a good pony.

Well, we had a pony that had an electric
fence that pulled all his skin down.

So we had to pull it up like a sock,

bandage it with Manuka
honey every day;

fresh Manuka honey on everyday

and the whole thing
has healed completely

and vets can't believe it.

What's particularly unfortunate is that

honeybees are often blamed for stings

that are inflicted by other hymenopterans.

To an entomologist a yellow-jacket

is a wasp. It looks nothing like a bee.

Bees are sort of brownish and fuzzy,

yellow-jackets are yellow
and black and shiny.

Different behavior, different gestalt.

But the vast majority of non-entomologists,
people are either unwilling to

or unable to differentiate.

Ah! A Bee!

So bees get a lot of bad
press that is undeserved.

Can you clip this little
branch there first?

This one right here? Yeah.

It's about to go. Okay.

Oops.

A swarm,

as much as people don't like it,

is a natural way of procreation;

of guaranteeing that more
colonies of bees are there.

And at the right time when the
new queens are ready to emerge

the old queen with almost half of the
entire workers will leave the hive.

They swirl around in the
circumference of maybe 50 feet

and then the queen lands and
alights on maybe a branch

and the of the rest of those
swarm bees gather in a cluster

and they hang there until they
are either taken by the beekeeper

or they find a new home.

So the commercial or the
average hobby beekeeper

prevents swarming

and we have taken that joy,

that joie de vivre,

that wonderful invigorating activity

away from them.

For the honeybee to regain her health

I think we also have to see that
the swarming is allowed again

as much as possible.

When somebody calls,

and I'm on lists all over
the place for swarms,

I actually go to the hives where people
are freaked out and they're afraid.

That to me is like,

"'Uh oh! Hive in danger."

A lot of people will call an exterminator.

They really think that the bees are
going to attack or something like that.

They are at their most docile at that time.

Exterminators come and
they poison them!

I tell people that,

"'You are seeing a miracle of nature.

This is a force of nature come
and landed on your tree."

The beehive is just simply
moving to a new home.

The woman I was helping
she had just taken my class.

She didn't have any bees before.

Often I say,

"'Get a swarm. Don't buy bees.

That's commercial, that's
cattle ranching bees."

And I invite them to come
with me on a swarm call.

And I help people get
set up with their first hive.

It's so wonderful, then they get to handle
the bees and they get to be with them.

It isn't just sticking them into
a box and letting them grow.

So they get to interact with them
right from the very beginning.

Isn't that beautiful?

You could see how happy she was
and she started singing with the bees

and she was feeling into them and...

she'll be a good bee momma.

I can't express it!

I'm like a little kid.

It's like I got my first bicycle
or something, I don't know.

I'm just so excited to work with
them and learn with them and... yeah.

My name is Wisteria and I'm a backyard
beekeeper in Portland, Oregon

and we are building beehives
and painting bee boxes.

I've got my friends and family and
members of the bee project here.

We're tasting mead...

Which is delicious. It has a
little bit of sparkle to it.

...and just sharing with families from
Portland what beekeeping is all about.

I'm a rooftop beekeeper
in New York City.

And I'm a third generation beekeeper.

It's illegal here to keep bees.

It kind of scares me,
it worries me a little bit.

I really would like to keep my bees.

We're really just trying to do
something simple for nature.

This is really a crazy moment here.

As we're doing this
there is a swarm of bees!

They look like they're going
into that tree right there

which, is not... is just completely bizarre.

I'm not sure where they came from

and they're coming closer.

It does look like they are sort
of aiming right in there though.

That's crazy.

Yeah, I've never quite
seen this happening.

I think you guys brought
that mojo, honestly.

Only in the Bronx, baby,

are you going to find a swarm.

Legalize beekeeping!
Give the bees a chance.

Long live the honeybee! Wooo!

All we are saying, is give bees a chance.

Legalize beekeeping! Woo!

Give the bees a chance!

Beekeeping, the vital practice of man-
aging and maintaining honeybee colonies

for pollination and honey production,

is a banned practice in New York City.

This ban is outdated and detrimental
to the health and wellbeing

of our urban environment
and our community.

This bill needs our support

and I encourage you to call your
city council representative today

and encourage them to support councilman Yassky's bill.

One of my neighbors,

probably because they were
uninformed and scared maybe,

reported the hive to
the health department

and as a result I was served
with a notice of violation

and I have to appear at a
hearing in fifteen minutes.

If she has a child and sees, as she
pointed out, this swarm of bees -

If beekeeping is done
properly it's a safe activity.

This solves both problems.

Lets people who want to do it, do it,

and make sure that those who are
going to engage in this beekeeping

do it safely.

So, here we have a
wonderful opportunity

to do what other great cities have done:

Legalize bees, allow
for honey production,

whether it's on a tiny
rooftop or small garden

and build the sustainability
movement bee by bee.

At our Honey Festival there'll be tastings

and jugglers and demonstrations

so you should definitely come
and pick up your local honey there.

And all this week restaurants
across New York City are

participating in New York Nectar.

So, I'm a beekeeper here
at the Center for Discovery.

I just had this sense that I
had this calling to do service.

And so, I'm at home, I'm in heaven here.

One of the most amazing things
about the farm is that we're -

we're working with
people with disabilities.

But by working with them in a -

and integrating them into
a farm based program

they really become
individuals with abilities.

Nice work!

People with autism have
this innate affinity for nature

and so by working
outside they're at home.

So when I think about
Colony Collapse Disorder

I really hope that we can, as a society,

have a connection with nature

instead of a disconnect with nature.

And one of the things that I
really enjoy about the bees

is that they all have this really
strong sense of mission.

It's not about individual advantage.

It's not about getting ahead.

They take on different tasks,

like they might start
off as a housekeeper

and then a nurse bee

and much like we have
different roles here.

We have integration specialists
and skills trainers,

all sorts of people coming
together as a team

to provide a really rich and
meaningful life for our residents here.

Our job is to create a family for them

and to build a community that
they can really thrive in and where

they can find their own niche to really
be the individual that they really are.

If you take a single bee out of a hive,

it actually can't live on it's own.

It's biologically dependent
upon community.

And even though some humans
can survive on their own,

the individuals that we
take care of here cannot.

They really are dependent upon on
a team of people coming together

to be of service to them.

And coming together in all humility,

just like the bees do when they
take on their individual roles,

in their particular stage of life.

We have to care for
nature in the right way

and nature will care for us in turn.

So community is not
just a human problem,

it's a global problem, community
with one another and nature.

So human community is
the perfect training ground

for community with
the planet, with nature.

We keep bees because we love them

and we love them because
they need our help now.

Someone has to take care of them

and so the beekeeper's job is to see

that the bees stay happy and healthy.

We now have three colonies
of bees in that garden.

The children are absolutely
relaxed in their presence.

They are aware of the
problems of the honeybee.

So, bees belong to be all over the world

and the great problem now is they are
not because we are creating places

where they can't live.

That's why we're doing what
we're doing here in the garden.

We're trying to show you young people

how to put bees everywhere.

Colony Collapse, I've experienced it.

I'm an organic beekeeper
with the best of intentions.

I've gone to some hives
and they're gone.

The problems are here.

They're everybody's problems now

and we all suffer the
consequences of that.

Commercial beekeepers cannot
stop and reverse direction

without risking bankruptcy.

And an alternative

to rolling on the interstates
20,000 miles a year

would be to go to the various
monoculture productions

and simply tell them,

"'The writing is on the wall.

One of these springs you're going
to call for migratory beekeepers

and they won't be there for you
and you'll be out of business.

Why don't you take a small
portion of your holdings

and plow it under and plant
it with bee friendly crops

to sustain those creatures all year long

not just for three weeks in the spring.

That way you will know
what your situation is

because they'll be there
right on your property."

The honeybee belongs on every farm.

Turning this crisis around
is not going to be easy

and it won't happen overnight.

The bees are telling us to
become true caretakers

and the only solution is
creating a surrounding

of wild flowers and forage and diversity.

Spikenard Farm has been
not only a challenge

but the variety of tasks for me
is just, at times, overwhelming.

You can't manage everything alone.

And the help from other human beings
and other beings has to come in.

Even in two years now

a much greater variety of
insects are coming back.

It's very deeply satisfying.

And honeybee sanctuaries are springing
up like mushrooms in this country.

People have asked me, "Why
do you do what you're doing?

Do you have hope with
all the mess we are in,

with all we are doing in nature?"

And I would say I would have
hope to the very last day

to the last plant.

The bees are the most exquisite beings.

They show us what this
service can be like.
