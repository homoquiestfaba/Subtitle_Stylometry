<font color="yellow">Episode 8.</font>

<font color="red">THE LAST JEDI.</font>

The First Order prevails.

After decimating the
Pacific Republic,

the Supreme Leader Snoke

now send his ruthless

legions to take over

military of the galaxy.

Only General Leia Organa and

his group of
Resistance Fighter's

are opposed to the
growing tyranny,

convinced that the Jedi Master

Luke Skywalker will return

and restore the spark
of hope in the fight.

But the Resistance
has been exposed.

While the First
Order is directed

towards the rebel base,

the brave heroes organize a

desperate escape...

<i><font color="green">â™ª eerie music â™ª</font></i>

<i><font color="green">{\a6}â™« march music â™ª</font></i>

<i><b><font color="green">LETS BEGIN FOLKS...</font></b></i>

We're not start yet!

Is now 30 pounds of carry
field in the C marker.

Forget the ammunition, there's no time.
Lets get everyone to the transport.

Oh no.

We caught them In the
middle of the evacuation.

I have my orders of the
Supreme Leader Snoke himself.

This is where we snot-out the
resistance once and for all.

Tell Captain Kennedy the
time to dreadnought.

Annihilate that base,
Destroy that transports...

and annihilate that fleet.

General, resistance
ship approaching.

Launching shields
in attack mode.

Single light fighter?

Happy B-B, buddy, come on.

<i>We did a crazy stuff.</i>

Just for the record,
Commander Dameron...

I with the droid. This one.

<i>Thank you for your
support, General.</i>

Happy B-B8.

Attention!

This is Commander Poe
Dameron of the Republic...

<i>we/I have an urgent
communication for General Hux.</i>

Pass it to me.

This is General Hux
of the First Order.

The Republic is no more.

Your fleet are rebel
scum and war criminals.

Tell your princess there
will be no terms...

there will be no surrender.

<i>Hi, I'm waiting for General Hux.</i>

This is Hux.

You and your friends are doomed!

We will wipe your filth
from the galaxy.

<i>Okay. I wilt.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

Hello? Yup. I'm still here.

Can you, can you hear me?

<i>- Hux?
Perhaps.</i>

<i>An "H". Creepy guys.</i>

<i>A little messy.</i>

I can't hear you.
Can you hear me?

Look, I cannot wait forever.
If you reach him...

Tell him, Leia has an
urgent message for him.

I think he is too crazy, sir.

<i>About his mother.</i>

Open fire!

BB-8, punch it!

Goes for the dreadnought.

He's insane.

<i>Yuhuu! I got it kid.</i>

All right, now I
destroy the cannons.

<i>Tallie, start getting close.</i>

<i>Copy that.</i>

Captain Canady, why is not that flimsy
ship being riddled with bullets?

That flimsy ship is very
small and very close.

We must launch our fighters...

Five fucking minutes ago.

It will never
penetrate our armor.

It does not try to
penetrate our armor.

It is eliminating our
surface cannons.

<i>There is a cannon left.</i>

<i>And here comes the parade.</i>

<i>Yes! Yes, I see it!</i>

<i>No no. Dammit!</i>

BB-8, my weapons do not work.

We will eliminate
that last cannon...

or the bombers are fried.

Make your magic work, partner.

Are auto-guns ready?

Ready and ready, sir.

What are we waiting for?

Shoot the base!

Go ahead!

<i>Last transport in flight.
Evacuation list.</i>

You did it, Poe.

Now bring your squad
so we can leave here.

No, General...

<i>We can not do it. We can't...</i>

knock down a dreadnought.

<i>Those things are
fleet assassins.</i>

<i>We can not let it escape.</i>

Retire now...

<i>Commander. That's an order...</i>

Commander. That's an order...

Clear that nervous expression
on your face, C-3PO.

I'll try, General.

Nervous?

Come on, BB-8.

Now or never!

<i>Yes!</i>

Clear! Bring the pumps.

Captain...

The Resistance bombers
are approaching.

Of course.

<i>Bombers, keep that formation.</i>

<i>Fighters, protect the bombers.</i>

<i>We can not always give a
dreadnught, it's worth it.</i>

<i>Understood, Blue Leader.</i>

<i>If you take us there,
we will shoot them.</i>

<i>- Copy that.
Fighters coming.</i>

<i>Gunners, move faster.</i>

<i>Snub hunts at 2-10!</i>

<i>- Are getting closer!
Form yourself!</i>

<i>They are everywhere!</i>

<i>- Here they come.
Fighters arrive. Form yourself.</i>

<i>Vector at attack speed.</i>

<i>- Stand up!
Right side.</i>

<i>Help! We collapsed!</i>

Recharge the auto-guns.

Point to that cruise.

I see. Tallie, they have
targeted the fleet...

<i>And the preparation
sequence began.</i>

<i>It is understood.</i>

<i>We are almost there.</i>

<i>Bombers...</i>

<i>Start counting to
throw the bombs.</i>

<i>I have eye contact
with the target.</i>

<i>We are approaching
the point of attack.</i>

<i>The pumps are armed.</i>

Auto-guns pointing.

Subtract 40 seconds
for full load.

Destroy that last bomber!

Paige, come on. We are
on the objective.

Open the floodgates.

It is the only bomber that remains.
All up to you!

<i>- Nix!
Paige!</i>

Now throw the explosives!

Watch out!

Do not!

<i>Get out bombs!</i>

Direct impact!

Dreadnought knocked down!

General, Supreme Leader Snoke...

is making contact
from your ship.

Excellent.

I will attend you in my room.

<i>General Hux.</i>

<i>All right. Supreme leader.</i>

<i>My disappointment...</i>

<i>by its performance can
not be exaggerated.</i>

You can not escape,
Supreme Leader.

We have them tied to a rope.

King!

Well done, friend.

"Finn dripping bag"? What?
Did you burn a chip?

Finn! Finn. Companion.

Good to see you.

What? Come on...

We have to dress you. Come on.

You must have my questions.

Where is Rey?

Master Skywalker?

Master Skywalker?

I'm from the Resistance.

My sister Leia sent me.
We need your help.

Hello?

Go away.

Chewie, what are you doing here?

He said to come back with us.

How did you find me?

We'll tell you the
story in the Falcon.

<i>Hawk?</i>

Wait.

Where is Han?

In effect, tied to a rope, General Hux.
Well done.

The Resistance will
soon be in our hands.

Thank you, Supreme Leader.

You wonder why I
have a rabid dog?

In a place of so much power?

The weakness of a
well-manipulated dog...

It can be a sharp instrument.

How is your wound?

<i>Is nothing.</i>

The powerful Kylo Ren.

When I found you...

I saw what every
teacher dreams to see.

A pure and wild power.

And beyond that,
something truly special.

The potential of your lineage.

A new Vader.

Now I'm afraid...

That I was wrong.

<i>Everything I have,
I gave it to you.</i>

<i>To the dark side.</i>

Take off that ridiculousness.

Yes, there it is.

In you there is too much of your
father's heart, young Solo.

I killed Han Solo.

When the time came,
I did not doubt it.

And look at you, the feat
deeply hurt your spirit.

You were unbalanced...

Defeated by a girl who had
never held a Lightsaber!

You failed!

Skywalker is alive.

The seed of the Jedi
Order is alive.

And while that happens...

Hope lives in the galaxy.

I thought you would be the
one to extinguish it.

Oh me, you're not Vader.

You are just a child...

wearing a mask.

Prepare my ship.

There is no light
left in Kylo Ren.

It is just getting stronger.

The First Order will control
the main systems in weeks.

We need your help.

We need back to the Jedi Order.

We need Luke Skywalker.

They do not need Luke Skywalker.

Did you hear something I said?

What do you think?

What will I do with a lightsaber
to face the First Order?

What did you think was
going to happen here?

Do you think I came?

To the farthest place in
the galaxy for nothing?

Go away.

I will not leave without you!

Watch out!

You are wasting your time.

Who you are?

I know this place.

It was built a thousand
generations ago...

to save this.

The original Jedi texts.

Like me, it's the last thing
left of the Jedi religion.

You saw this place.

You saw this island.

Only in dreams.

Who you are?

He sent me the Resistance.

Did they send you?

What is special about you?

Where are you from?
From nowhere.

Nobody is from nowhere.
From Jakku.

Well, that's the closest
thing to nowhere.

Why are you here,
Rey, from nowhere?

He sent me the Resistance.

We need your help. The first
Order is unstoppable.

Why are you here?

There is something inside
me that was always there.

But now he is awake.

And I'm scared.

I do not know what it is...

or what to do with that.

And I need help.

You need a teacher.

I can not teach you.

Why not?

I saw your daily routine.
You're not occupated.

I will never train
another Jedi generation.

I came to die to this island.

It's time for the
Jedi to finish.

Why?

Leia sent me here with hope.

If she was wrong, she
deserves to know why.

We all deserve it.

<i>(Subtitled by cinabenglu5:)</i>

You degrade.

What? Wait!

We demolished a dreadnought.

At what cost?

If you start an attack,
you finish it.

Poe, stop thinking as a pilot.

There are things
you can not solve!

Climbing an X-wing and
blowing something up!

I need you to learn that.

There were heroes
in that mission.

Dead heroes.

No leaders.

We are far.

How will Rey find us?

A camouflaged binary beacon?

To indicate your way home.

Well, until she comes
back, what's the plan?

We need to find a new base.

One with power to send a
distress signal to our allies...

scattered in the Outer Rim.

Proximity alert!

They found us.

It is impossible.

It's Snoke's ship.

Can not be.

Can we do the jump?

We have fuel for a jump.

Do it. We have to
get out of here.

Wait.

They tracked us while we were
going at the speed of light.

That's impossible.

Yes.

And they did it.

If we make another leap...

they will find us, and
we will run out of fuel.

They have us.

Not yet, they do not have us.

Permission to go on an
X-wing to fly something?

Permission granted.

Admiral, surround us!

Reverse. Rotate the shields!

To your posts! Move!

Do what I do.

<i>Green squadron to
launch position.</i>

<i>Clear the launch traffic.</i>

Do not wait for me!
Get up and start!

<i>Technicians, secure supplies
for launch conditions.</i>

Move!

Poe, are you okay?

We have to get away from
the Star Destroyers.

Is what?

At full speed.

The fighters will retreat if they
move away from the Star Destroyers.

All the ships, at full power!

Concentrate rear shields.

<i>Ren, the Resistance
is out of reach.</i>

<i>We can not cover it
at this distance.</i>

<i>Go back to the fleet.</i>

What is the purpose of all this?

If we can not blow up
three small cruises?

They are faster
and lighter, sir.

They can maintain
such a distance...

that our guns do not
affect their shields.

Well, continue with the bombing.

At least let's remind them
that we're still here.

Very well sir.

They will not last long
consuming fuel like that.

It's just a matter of time.

Move! Make way! Make room!

His vital signs are weak,
but he is struggling.

Artoo?

Artoo!

Yes.

Yes I know.

Hey, it's a sacred island,
take care of your vocabulary.

Old friend.

I wish I could get
you to understand.

But I will not return.

Nothing can make
me change my mind.

<i>Years ago, you served my
father in the Clone Wars.</i>

<i>Now he begs you to help him in
his fight against the Empire.</i>

<i>It hurts me not to be able
to say it in person...</i>

That was a cheap trick.

<i>But they are
attacking my ship...</i>

<i>and I fear that my mission to
bring you to Alderaan failed.</i>

<i>It is our most desperate hour.</i>

<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

<i>You are my only hope.</i>

Tomorrow at dawn.

Three lessons

I will teach you the
customs of the Jedi...

and why they should end.

The General Organa...

Read...

He is unconscious
but do not worry.

They are the only
good news I have.

Admiral Ackbar... all
our leaders, died.

Leia was the only
survivor on the bridge.

Oh God!

If I were here, I'd say save
your pain for after the battle.

For that reason...

The chain of command is clear
about who should take his place.

Vice Admiral Holdo...

of the Ninka cruise.

Thanks, Commander.

We are four thousand...
in three ships.

We are the last remaining
of the Resistance.

But we are not alone.

In every corner of the galaxy...

the enslaved and oppressed
know our symbol...

and they put their hope in him.

We are the spark that will ignite the
fire that will restore the Republic.

That spark...

this Resistance, must survive.

That is our mission.

Now, to your posts.

And may the Force be with us.

Is that Admiral Holdo?

The same as the battle
of Chyron Belt?

That's not what I expected.

Vice Admiral?

Commander Dameron.

For the fuel consumption...

for a very limited time...

We will be out of
reach of your ships.

You are very kind to inform me.

Leave those calculations to me.

And we need to lose them
before finding another base...

What is our plan?

Our plan, captain?

No commander, right?

Was not Deiarte the last
official act of Leia?

Because of your
dreadnought plan...

where we lost the entire
fleet of bombers?

"Captain." "Commander." You
can call me as you want.

I just want to
know what happens.

Of course.

I get it.

I tried many intrepid
trigger triggers like you.

You are impulsive.

Dangerous.

And the last thing we need.

So stay at your post...

and follow my orders.

<i>Turbo-lifts seven and eight
disconnected for maintenance.</i>

What are you doing here?

Hi.

I was... You know...
You are Finn!

The unmatched Finn!

The unequaled Finn?
I am sorry.

I worked behind the
pipes all day.

It is not my fort to give talk
to heroes of the Resistance.

Give...

give a talk.

My name is Rose.

Breathe.

Good.
Yes.

Hey, I'm not a
Resistance hero, but...

It was nice to chat with you.

May the Force be with you.

Go.

You too.

Good.

But you are a hero.

You left the First Order
of the Starkiller Base.

My sister Paige said...

"Rose, he's a true hero."

"Difference good and bad."

"And does not run away
when it's difficult."

You know...

this morning, I had to stop...

three who were trying to
escape from the ship.

In this escape pod.

What?

They were running away.

That's embarrassing.

I know.

Anyway...

I must continue with
what I was doing.

What were you doing?

Checks.
Checking the escape pods.

No, routine checks.

Approaching one...

with a travel bag.

It's okay.

Listen, I...

I can not move.

I know - What happened?

I lock you up and give
you up as a deserter.

I was not deserting.

I told you that...
My sister just died...

protecting the fleet.

And you were running away.

Sorry.

This fleet is doomed...

If my friend comes back
to her, she will be too.

I must wear this...

I must take this
beacon very far.

That way she will
find me and be safe.

You are a selfish traitor.

We do not overtake the
fleet of the First Order.

Let's jump at the
speed of light!

They can track us.

Tracking at the speed of light?
Yes.

They would appear and
consume a lot of fuel.

Of which, by the way, we
have very little left.

They track us at the speed of light.
Yes.

And they could...

I do not feel my tooth.

What did you shoot me with?

Active tracking.

And now that?

New hyperspace tracking...

it must have the same principle
of every active tracker.

They're just tracking us...
Yes...

of the main ship.
Principal.

But we can not
reach the tracker.

It is a class A process
controlled from the bridge.

But all Class A process...

It has a dedicated switch.

But...

Who knows how to get to the
Star Destroyer substation?

I'm the guy who
used to clean them.

If we can get there...

I can turn off his tracker.

Repeat it, but easier.

The First Order only tracks us
from a Destroyer, the main one.

So we make it explode?

I like how you think, but no.

We would be tracked
from another Destroyer.

But yes...
If we sneak into the main...

and we turn off the tracker
without you noticing, we can...

You will not notice that
it is off by a cycle.

About six minutes.

Stand on board.

Turn off the tracker.

Our fleet escapes
before they realize it.

How did you meet?

A matter of luck.

Yes?

Good luck?

I'm not sure yet.

Poe, we have to do it.

It will save the fleet and King.

If I must be the only
voice of reason...

Admiral Holdo will
not like this plan.

Yes, you're right, C-3PO.

Only those who need
it will know...

and she will not know.

That was not exactly...
All right...

turn off the tracker.

I will be here to make the jump.

The question is...

How do we put them on
the Snoke Destroyer?

Stealing authorization codes.

No, they are Bio-Hexaencripted
and decode them.

We can not go through their
shields without being detected.

Nobody can.

<i>Could I do it?</i>

<i>Of course I could.</i>

<i>But I can not do it.</i>

<i>Now I'm a little busy.</i>

<i>Maz?</i>

<i>What happens?</i>

<i>A union conflict. They will
not want to know about it.</i>

<i>But, luckily for you...</i>

<i>There's a guy I trust who can
decipher something like that!</i>

<i>He is a master decipherer...</i>

<i>an expert pilot...</i>

<i>a poet with a blaster.</i>

Oh heavens.

It seems that the deciphering
friend can do everything.

<i>Oh yeah.</i>

<i>You will find it with a red
ploom flower on its lapel...</i>

<i>betting on high
betting tables...</i>

<i>in the casino... in Canto Bight.</i>

Can I sing Bight? No. That's...

Maz... Can we take care of this?

<i>I'm sorry, baby.</i>

<i>It is de-encrypting sparse.</i>

<i>If you want to go to that
Destroyer, I know only one option.</i>

<i>Find the master decipherer.</i>

You will bring me
Luke Skywalker.

You are not going to do it.
The effort could kill you.

Can you see what surrounds me?

You are going to pay
for what you did!

I can not see what
is around you.

Only you.

So no.

This is something else.

Luke.

What is it about?

I cleaned my blaster.
It shot itself.

Let us begin.

Who were those things?

Guardians.

Natives of the island.

They preserved the Jedi
structures from its construction.

I do not think I like them.

I can not imagine why.

Master Skywalker...

You have to bring the Jedi...

because Kylo Ren is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

Without the Jedi, we will not
have a chance against him.

What do you know
about the Force?

It's a power of the Jedi that allows
them to control people and...

make things float.

Awesome.

Every word in that
sentence was wrong.

Lesson one...

Sit here, with
your legs crossed.

The Force is not any
power that you have.

It is not about floating rocks.

It is the energy
among all things...

a tension, a balance...

that links the entire universe.

It's okay.

But what is it?

Close your eyes.

Breathe.

Now...

stretch.

I feel something.

You feel it?
Yes.

It's the Force.
Seriously?

Oh, he must be very
strong with you.

I never felt anything...

Oh!

You said to stretch me like...

I'll try again.

Breathe.

Just breathe.

Stretch with your feelings.

Do you see?

<i>The island.</i>

<i>Lifetime.</i>

<i>Death and decomposition...</i>

<i>that feeds the new life.</i>

<i>Hot.</i>

<i>Cold.</i>

<i>Peace.</i>

<i>Violence.</i>

And among all that?

Balance.

An energy.

A force.

And inside you?

Inside of me...

the same Force.

And this is the lesson.

The Force does not
belong to the Jedi.

To say that if the Jedi die,
the light dies, it is vanity.

Can you feel it?

There is something more...

under the island.

A place.

A dark place.

Balance.

Powerful light,
powerful darkness.

It is cold.

Calls me.

Resist it, King.

King?

King!

You went straight to darkness.

That place was trying
to show me something.

It offered you
something you needed.

And you did not even
try to stop you.

But I did not see you.

Not at all.

You prevented him from
accessing the Force.

Of course.

I saw this pure
force only once...

in Ben Solo.

At that time it did
not scare me enough.

Yes now.

What was that?

Nothing, admiral.

Debris that happened.

The fleet has fuel
left for 18 hours.

We have to hurry.

I still can not contact
the Resistance?

Keep trying.

If you contact,
see how they are.

And ask for Finn.

Why does the Force connect us?

To both.

Killer snake.

You're late.

You lost. I found Skywalker.

Did he tell you what happened?

The night I destroyed your
temple, did he tell you why?

I know everything
I need about you.

Yes?

Yes.

You have that look in your eyes.

The one in the forest.

When you called me a monster.

You are a monster.

Yes I am.

We enter, find the
encoder and exit.

Do you know this city?
Can I sing Bight?

For what they count.

It's a horrible place full of
the worst people in the galaxy.

Great.

I told those two...

"The beach is public, they
can not park that ferry."

But they left at full
speed to the casino.

Place your bets.

All the bets on the table, now!
Place your bets here.

Yes!

This place is great!

Good.

Maz says that this master decoder
would have a red plumb flower.

Let's go look for it
and get out of here.

Well played.

Win the house.

Rather, what are those manners?
Come on!

We toured the entire casino.
No ploom flower.

Where is this guy?

Are those what I think?

What are those things?

Fathiers.

I never saw a real one.

This whole place is beautiful.
Come on.

Why do you hate him so much?

Look better.

My sister and I grew up
in a poor mining system.

The First Order took us the
ore to finance its militia...

then they bombarded us
to test their weapons.

They took everything we had.

And who do you think they were?

There is only one business in the
galaxy that makes you so rich.

War.

Sell weapons to the First Order.

I would like...

to cross with my fist this
disgusting and beautiful city.

A red ploom flower!

A red ploom flower!

The master decipherer!

Look, those are the
bad ones parked.

It's okay.

They are arrested for
parking violation 27B / 6.

They have the right...
What was that?

No no. Not now, honey.

I have a good run.

Lesson two.

Now that they are extinct,
they are idealized, deified.

But if you take away the myths
and look at their works...

The legacy of the
Jedi is failure.

Hypocrisy, arrogance.

Is not true.

At the height of their power, they
decided to ascend to Darth Sidious...

and create the Empire
and eliminate them.

The Jedi Master was
responsible...

for the training and
creation of Darth Vader.

And he was saved by a Jedi.

He is the most hated
man in the galaxy.

But you saw that previously
I was conflicted.

You thought it was not all bad.
That he could convert it.

And I became a legend.

For many years, there
was balance...

and then I saw...

to Ben.

My nephew...

with that powerful
Skywalker blood.

And in my arrogance...

I thought I could train him,
that my strength could pass.

Han acted as expected, but...

Read...

He confided to his son.

I took him...

and a dozen students...

and I started a training temple.

When I noticed that I was no match
for the darkness that grew in him...

It was already too late.

What happened?

I went to face it.

And he turned against me.

Ben, no!

He must have thought
that I was dead.

When I regained consciousness...

the temple was burning.

He had disappeared with a
handful of my students.

And slaughtered the rest.

Leia blamed Snoke, but...

It was me.

I failed.

Because it was Luke Skywalker.

The Jedi master.

A legend.

The galaxy may need a legend.

I need someone to show
me my place in all this.

And you did not fail Kylo.

Kylo failed you.

I will not fail you.

The main cruise
remains out of reach.

But his medical frigate
has no fuel...

He ran out of shields.

The beginning of its end.

Destroy it.

Our last crew member was
evacuated and goes to you.

It was an honor, admiral.

Good trip, Rebels!

Admiral...

there is fuel left
for six hours.

Keep the current course.

Keep it.

Finn... Rose, where
are you guys?

Repay me cards.

Thank you.

Finn, the fleet is in the last.

Without a decipherer to sneak into
the Star Destroyer of Snoke...

What do we do?
I do not know.

If you do not have a thief in your pocket,
our plan does not go any further.

I can do it.

What?

What?

What?

Excuse me, just...

I could not help listening to
everything they said so loud...

while trying to sleep.

Decoder?

Thief?

I can do it.

We do not talk about
stealing wallets, okay?

Yes.

Do not be fooled by my
appearance, friend.

The codes of the First Order and I
have known each other for a long time.

Y...

If the price is reasonable...

I could make you enter
Old Snoke's apartment.

Do not.
Ya... we already have it under control.

Just...?
Yes.

We must get out of here!
Over here!

Why, little one?

You did this?

Hey, get your hands up!

Hands up!

Yes, man.

What is your story, chubby?

They went out there!

Close all exits.

Wait.

It smells great.

Those cops will be here shortly.
And now?

No wait. Please wait!

We are with the Resistance.

It is understood. Now we
will review the stables.

Here.
They must have passed through here.

Walking, walking!

Stop enjoying it!

<i>We've got them. They are
not going anywhere.</i>

Move! Get out of the way!

Our ship is on the beach
that we have ahead!

We need protection!

Too much protection!

So is!

Do not!

Come on!

<i>Let go of the flock.
Follow the criminals.</i>

<i>Where did they go?</i>

I think we lost it!

Now we go down to the
beach and come back...

A cliff!

We're trapped.

I think it was worth it.

Raze that town...

To hurt them.

Come on.

Now it's worth it.

<i>They are there.</i>

BB-8!

Wait, are you
piloting that thing?

Do you need a lift?

Luke.

Leia.

I would prefer not
to do this now.

Yes, the same.

Why did you hate your father?

Have something? A tunic
or something to wear?

Why did you hate your father?
Answer me with sincerity.

You had a father who loved you...
he cared

I did not hate him.

Then why?

Why, what?

Why what? Say it.

Because it...?

Because you killed?

I do not understand.

Do not?

Your parents threw
you like garbage.

Do not!
Yes.

But you can not
stop needing them.

It is your greatest weakness.

You look for them everywhere...

in Han Solo...

now in Skywalker.

Did he tell you what
happened that night?

Yes.

Do not.

<i>He sensed my power...</i>

how does he perceive yours?

And that scared him.

Liar.

Let the past die.

Kill him if necessary.

It is the only way to become
what you are destined for.

Do not!

Do not!

King?

I should have felt
trapped or scared.

But no.

It did not last forever, I
knew I was going somewhere.

And that, at last, would
show me what I came to see.

King.

<i>Subtitled by cinabenglu5.</i>

Let me see them.

To my parents...

please.

I thought that here I
would find answers.

I was wrong.

I never felt so lonely.

You are not alone.

You neither.

King?

It's not too late.

Stop!

It is true?

Did you try to kill him?

Leave this island now!

Stop.

Stop!

You did it?

Did you create Kylo Ren?

Tell me the truth.

I saw the darkness.

<i>I felt it forming in him.</i>

<i>I saw her at times
during her training.</i>

<i>But then I looked inside...</i>

<i>and it went beyond
what I never imagined.</i>

<i>Snoke had already
converted his heart.</i>

<i>He would bring destruction,
pain, death...</i>

<i>and the end of everything I love
for what will end up being.</i>

<i>And for the brief moment
of pure instinct...</i>

<i>I thought I could stop it.</i>

<i>It passed like a
fleeting shadow.</i>

<i>And I left feeling ashamed...</i>

<i>suffering the consequences.</i>

<i>And the last thing I saw...</i>

<i>they were the eyes of a frightened
boy whose teacher had failed him.</i>

Come, no!

You failed to think
that he already chose.

It was not so.

There is still conflict inside.

If he turned from the dark side,
that could change everything.

It could be the way to win.

This is not going to
come out as you think.

Yes.

Only when we touch our hands...

I saw your future.

As solid as I see you.

If I go with him, Ben
Solo will become.

King...

do not do it.

Then he is our last hope.

Yoda teacher.

Young Skywalker.

I'm going to finish all this.

The tree, the text, the Jedi.

I'm going to burn everything.

Skywalker I missed you.

So it's time...

that the Jedi Order be finished.

Time is.

Many old books you ignore.

The sacred Jedi texts.

Oh Read, have you?

Well, I...
Exciting books... are not.

Yes Yes.

Wisdom possess...

but that library contains
nothing that the girl King...

no longer have

Skywalker...

Still looking for the horizon.

Never here, now, huh?

The need in your noses.

I was weak.

Unwise.

Losing Solo, you did it.

Losing King, we should not.

I can not be what
she needs me to be.

Pay attention to what I
said, you have not, right?

Teach what you learned.

Force... domain...

But the weakness...

foolishness... and also failure.

Yes, more than
anything, failure.

The greatest teacher,
the failure is.

Luke...

we are what they become.

It is the true burden
of all teachers.

Four parsecs to arrive.
Is very fast.

I hope we are still on time.

You can do it, right?

Yes, with respect to that...

Guys, I can do it.

But there is a previous
conversation about the price.

When we finish, the Resistance
will give you what you want.

What do you have as an advance?

Are you kidding? Look at us.

Is that Haysian metal?

It's already something.

No, we gave you our word.
We are going to pay you.

It should be enough.

Guys, I want to
continue helping.

But if there is nothing,
I do not do anything.

Well, listen... you must...

Do it.

Now I can help.

Give it back.

What?

Give it back!

You do not know what
it means to her.

What are you...? Why do you
plunder your own ship?

It is not your ship.

He says I stole it.

Yes I get it.

We stole it.

At least we rob the bad guys...

and help the good.

Good guys, bad guys...

Invented words.

Let's see who this precious
piece of scrap was from.

This guy was a weapons dealer.

He could found his side by
selling weapons to bad guys.

And the good ones.

Finn, let me show you
something important.

Everything is a
machinery, partner.

Live free, do not join.

It was his last support ship.

Now it's your main cruise.

And your fuel reserve?

According to our calculations...
very low.

Is there?
He forbade you to be on the bridge.

Let's not make a fuss.
Do not.

Holdo?
You can not be here.

Bold.

Enough, ma'am.

We had a fleet, now we have only one
ship and you did not tell us anything!

Tell us we have a plan!

That there is still hope!

When I served with Leia...

She said that hope
is like the sun.

If you only believe in him
when you can see him...

You will never
survive the night.

Yes.

Do you fuel the transports?

Yes.

To all?

Do we leave the ship? That is...

Is that your plan? That's
what you brought us for?

Coward!

Those transports are
unarmed, without shields.

If we abandon this
cruise, we are lost.

We have no chance No,
you're not just a coward...

You are a traitor.

Get this man out of my bridge.

Finn, Holdo takes the
crew to the ferry.

You will leave the ship.
Where are you?

Poe, we're returning
to the fleet.

We are so close.

And the master decipherer?

We find a decipherer.

We can disable the tracker.
Win a little more time.

All right. Hurry up.

As soon as it takes
off, get out of reach.

Stay there until I let you know
where the meeting point is.

If you see Finn before me...
tell him...

Yes, perfect. Tell that.

Camouflaged approach. They
should not detect us.

Then we make a slit
to his shield.

And we sneaked around.

So a Strumtrooper, who else?
Doing what?

They try to save us.

It is our best chance to escape.

Give them all the time you
can to Finn and Rose.

You bet the survival
of the Resistance...

to something improbable
you put us all in danger.

Now time is over.

We must evacuate the cruise.

Load the transports.
Yes.

Yes, I had to say that.

Vice Admiral Holdo...

I take over your command...

so that this ship survives,
its crew and the Resistance.

I hope you understand
what we do.

Yes.

I'm going to the bridge.

If they move, stun them.

It is at least three cycles.

Yes sir. We work on that.

Very good.

I will do my best, sir.

We are almost there.

You do not have to do this.

I feel the conflict inside you.

It is destroying you.

And then, when we
touch our hands...

I saw your future.

Only its form, but
solidly and clearly.

You will not bow to Snoke.

You will become.

I'll help you.

I saw it.

I also saw something.

From what I saw...

I know that when the time
comes, you will become.

You will stay with me.

King.

I saw who your parents are.

Well done, my good and
faithful apprentice.

I regained my faith in you.

Young lady Rey.

Welcome.

Is this.

The tracker is behind this door.

Haysian metal.

Better driver.

And you're welcome.

Good time to see how to
get back to the fleet.

I know where the
nearest escape pod is.

Of course.

BB-8, tell me something good.

Poe, we're almost there.

<i>Ready the cruise for the jump.</i>

Yes, I'm in that, friend.
Hurry up.

Escort the officers
to the hangar.

Commander... Captain Dameron,
Admiral Holdo was looking for him.

Yes, we already talked.

Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask.

You have a good instinct, C-3PO.
Keep it up.

Seal that door!

We run out of time.

Come on, how's it going?

Almost ready.

C-3PO, where do you
think you're going?

I would go against my program...

participate in a riot.
Hears!

It is not a valid protocol.

Not this one!

Finn?

We are ready to jump.

It's now or never.

Now.

<i>You, hands up!</i>

<i>Watch them.</i>

<i>- Throw your weapons.
Hands up, rebels.</i>

<i>Lower them! Lower them, I said!</i>

<i>FN-2187.</i>

<i>It's good that you came back.</i>

They did not make it.

Leia.

<i>Approach transportation according
to your evacuation designation.</i>

<i>Clear the transports.</i>

Let me push them, guys.

That is problematic.

I like it.

Me too.

It's time to approach
your transport.

So that transports escape...

someone must stay to
pilot the cruise.

Too many casualties.

Ican't hold it any more.

Of course you can.

You showed me how.

What the Force...

Follow you I already
repeated it enough.

May the force always
accompany you.

<i>Activated camouflage device.
We should be out of reach.</i>

Hopefully it works.

Come closer, girl.

Too much strength.

The darkness ascends...

and light too, to meet her.

I warned my young apprentice...

that if it got stronger...

its equivalent in
light would rise.

Skywalker...

I assumed...

mistakenly.

Closer, I said.

You underestimate Skywalker...

to Ben Solo...

and me.

That will be your downfall.

You have seen something?

A weak point in my apprentice.

Is that why you came?

Silly young girl.

It was me who connected
their minds.

I fueled Ren's
internal conflict.

I knew he was not strong
enough to hide it from you.

And that you were not so
wise as to resist that bait.

And now...

you will give me Skywalker.

Then I will kill you...

with the most atrocious blow.

Do not.

Yes.

Give to me...

all.

Do not!

Do not!

Do not.

No no!

Poe.

What is that?

The mineral planet, Crait.

An unknown hiding place from
the days of the Rebellion.

Is that a Rebel base?
Abandoned...

but strongly armored...

that can send a distress
signal to the allies...

scattered in the Outer Rim.

Holdo knew that the
First Order...

he was tracking our big ship.

They do not monitor
small transports.

We could go down to the
surface without being seen...

and hide until the
First Order passes.

It could work.

She was more interested in
protecting the light than in...

look like a heroine.

Good trip...

Rebels.

Good job, Phasma.

Your ship and your
payment, as we agreed.

Lying snake.

They caught us...

I made a deal.

Wait...

A deal with what?

We send you the
information of the thief.

We say a sweep of des
camouflage, and, effectively...

there were 30 freshly launched
Resistance transports.

He told us the truth.

Are the surprises never over?

Do not.

Are our weapons ready?

Lists and notes, sir.

Shoot at will.

Wait. No, You can not!

Do not!

Admiral, we are under attack!

We go back?
No, they're too far away.

Maximum speed to the base!

At full speed!

Good good...

I did not expect
Skywalker to be so wise.

We will give him and
the Jedi Order...

the death he wants.

When the Rebels die...

we will go to your planet...

and we will devastate
the whole island.

You have so much determination.

Now look here.

All the Resistance is
in those transports...

Soon they will all be dead.

For you, everything is lost.

And you still have that
fiery breath of hope.

You have the spirit
of a true Jedi!

And so...

you must die.

My valuable apprentice...

son of darkness, the
apparent heir of Lord Vader.

Where there was conflict,
now being determination.

Where there was
weakness, strength.

Finish your training...

and fulfill your destiny.

I know what I have to do.

Ben.

Do you think you can convert it?

Pathetic girl.

I can not be betrayed...

I can not be beaten.

I see your mind...

I see all your intentions.

Yes.

I see it lighting the
Lightsaber to hit the truth.

And now...

Silly girl... he lights it...

And kill your real enemy!

Maximum thrusters.
At full speed!

Yes sir.

Damn murderer.

Calm down, Great F.

They burst you today, you
blow them up tomorrow.

They are only business.

You're wrong.

Maybe.

Ben!

The fleet.

Order them to cease fire.

There is still time
to save the fleet.

Ben?

It's time to let
all the old die.

Snoke...

Skywalker.

The Sith...

the Jedi, the Rebels...
Let them all die.

King.

I want you to join me.

We can reign together and bring
a new order to the galaxy.

Do not do this, Ben.

Do not go this way.

No. You're holding on! Come on!

Do you want to know the
truth about your parents?

Or did you always know?

And you simply hid it.

You know the truth.

Tell the.

Tell the.

They were nobody.

They were dirty
scrap merchants...

who sold you to have
money to drink.

They are dead...

in a very poor grave in
the desert of Jakku.

There is no place for
you in this story.

You grew up without having anything.
You are nothing.

But not for me.

Join me.

Please.

Mr...

the Resistance cruiser
prepares for the jump.

It is empty.

They are trying to
divert our attention.

Pathetic.

Keep attacking the transports.

<i>Running them with a blaster
is too good for them.</i>

<i>That hurts.</i>

Finn...

<i>When ordered.</i>

She is escaping.

Do not.

Do not!

Shoot that cruise!

<i>Execute</i>

Finn!

There's a ferry back there!
We have to go!

<i>Traitor!</i>

<i>What?</i>

Finn!

<i>You are a mistake in the system.</i>

Come on, baby.

Come on!

Do not!

Hears.

<i>They were always garbage.</i>

Rebel waste.

Hears!

Do you need someone to take you?

What happened?

The girl killed Snoke.

What happened?

He took Snoke's escape ship.

We know where he is going.

Send troops to that
base of the Resistance.

We finish this.

Finish this?

Who do you think
is talking to you?

Are you going to
command my troops?

Our Supreme Leader is dead!
We do not have a ruler!

The Supreme Leader is dead.

Long live the Supreme Leader.

They are coming,
close the doors.

Entering!

Walking! Move!

Close that door of
the shield well!

Do not shoot! We are!
Do not shoot!

Stop the fire!

Do not shoot!
Stop the fire!

Finn?
Finn!

Rose! You are not dead!

Where is my droid?

Companion!

I'm so happy to see you!

Wait to?

Wait, more slowly.

Is all that remains?

We have the shields, they
can not give us from orbit.

Use the power we have...

to issue a distress
signal to the Outer Rim.

Use my personal code.

If there is any ally
to the Resistance...

it's now or never.

Rose, what do you have?

Rotted munitions, rusted artillery,
and broken skim speeders.

Good...

Let us pray that this door
will hold until we get help.

A gun ram.

A what, sorry?

A mini Death Star.

It will break that
door like nothing.

There has to be a
back door, right?

BB-8, what do you have?

BB-8 analyzed the
scheme of the mine.

This is the only way
to enter or exit.

Come on.

We have allies.

People believe in Leia.

They will receive our
message and they will come.

But we have to buy time.

We are going to
destroy that canyon.

To me!

Move!

Behind! Take your weapons!

Come here!

Do not shoot!

It's salt.

Forces of surfaces, entering.

Understood, we're on our way.

Turn on your mono-ski.

The green switch.

Well, listen.

<i>I do not like these scraps...</i>

nor our possibilities, but...

What the hell?

Stay together...

and do not get too close until
they take out the cannon.

Surface forces, shoot a little!

13 light ships arrive.

Do we wait until
we eliminate them?

No. The Resistance
is in that mine.

Go through them.

Fighters, get separated!

Come on! We have to stop them
until they take out that cannon!

<i>Rose, you have three behind you!</i>

I can not lose them.

Yes!

I like this!

Fly that junk to pieces and
get it out of the sky!

All the fighters!

Chewie, get them
out of the battle.

Get away from the speeders.

She drove them away! To all!

Oh, they hate that ship!

Chewie!

There is!

That is a big weapon.

It is heavily armored.

The only possibility is to
go straight to the throat.

The cannon opens. It
is our opportunity.

Shoot everything
to those speeders.

Concentrate fire
on those speeders!

We are having great losses.

They destroy us one by one. We
are not going to achieve it.

<i>I make my final approach.</i>

<i>Target in sight, ready weapons.</i>

Do not! Stop!

What?

The cannon is loaded!
It is suicidal!

<i>To all the ships, get away!</i>

Do not! I'm almost there!
Withdrawal, Finn!

That's an order.

Finn? It's too late!
Do not do it!

Do not! I will not let them win!

Do not! Finn, listen to Poe!

<i>We have to retire!</i>

<i>The cannon is heating up.</i>

<i>It is understood. We see it.</i>

<i>Prepare to shoot.</i>

Move! Walking! Quick!

Come on!

Rose?

Rose?

Rose?

Because you did?

It had almost arrived.

Why did you stop me?

I saved you...

fool.

This is how we are going to win.

Not fighting against
what we hate...

but saving what we love.

General Hux... Advance.

No quarter.

Without prisoners.

Our distress signal was
received in many places...

but it was not answered.

They heard us...
but nobody comes.

We fight until the end.

But... the galaxy lost all hope.

The spark...

it went out

Luke.

I know what you
are going to say.

That I combed differently.

It looks good like that.

Read...

I am sorry.

I know.

I know that it is.

I'm glad you're here...

at the end.

I came to face him, Leia.

And I can not save it.

For a long time I
kept hope, but...

I know that my son is no more.

Nobody leaves really, never.

Master Luke.

I want to be shot with
everything we have that man.

Do it.

Plus!

Plus!

Enough.

Enough!

Do you think he beat him?

If we are ready to move...

we can finish this.

Mr?

Take me with him.

Keep the door covered and do
not advance until I tell you.

Supreme leader...

Do not get distracted,
our goal...

Right now, sir.

Medical package!

We need a medical package!

She is very badly hurt.

It's Kylo Ren.

Luke confronts him alone.

We should help him. Come on.

No wait. Wait.

Did you come back to
say you forgive me?

To save my soul?

Do not.

He does it for a reason.

A long time ago we can escape.

Escape?

It is one against an army. We
have to fight and help him.

No. We are the spark that will ignite
the fire that burns the First Order.

Skywalker does it
so we can survive.

There must be an exit from this mine.
Hell, how did he get in?

It is possible that there is
a natural input not mapped.

But this installation is such a
labyrinth of endless tunnels...

that the possibility of
finding an exit is 15,428...

Shut up!

To one.
Listen out.

My hearing sensors no
longer detect the...

Exact.

Where did the crystal
creatures go?

Follow me.

Why do they look at me?

Follow it.

If we have the mark below,
they must be somewhere.

Keep looking for ways of life.

Over here.

I see them! Chewie, there!

Do not.

No no.

Do not!

Lifting rocks.

I failed you, Ben.

Sorry.

I am sure that it is!

The Resistance is dead.

The war finished.

And when I kill you...

I will have killed
the last Jedi.

Amazing.

Every word you just said...

It was wrong.

The Rebellion was reborn today.

War...

It just starts.

And I will not be the last Jedi.

I will destroy her... to you...

and everything.

Do not.

Defeat me with anger and I
will always be with you.

As your father is.

Do not.

See you, boy.

Do not!

C'ai!

Is a very good friend.

Chewie!

Looks good.

It was crazy, man.

Hello.
Hello.

I'm Poe.

King.

I know.

I have a contact
in the Outer Rim.

It is very possible.

Luke is dead.

I felt it.

But it was neither sadness nor pain.
It was...

peace and intention.

I felt it too.

How do we build a
Rebellion with this?

We have everything we need.

Luke Skywalker... Jedi Master.
