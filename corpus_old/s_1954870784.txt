They call it pizza, darling!

Is it good?

It's just too messy to eat!

Five minutes till curtains up!

Five minutes!

"O blessed, blessed night!

"I am afeard...

"being in night...

"all this is but a dream...

"too flattering sweet
to be substantial.

"A thousand times the worse
to want thy light.

"love goes toward love
as schoolboys from their books...

"but love from love, toward school,
with heavy hearths...

Absolutely the most beautiful Juliet
I have ever seen.

Oh, Tom...

Are the vultures outside?

I think everyone must have gone
straight to the party.

Well, why don't you go out ahead,
I'll join you later.

I'm...

I'm still in a daze...

You were magnificent.

Magnificent.
And nothing you can say...

Will ever change my mind...

Hurry!

I haven't seen such bravery
since Dunkirk.

Didn't we loose at Dunkirk?

But fabulously played.

Oh, Christopher, I didn't even know
you were in town!

And my darling Guido...

Siete bellissima!

Ah, you're a beautiful lier!

Be angels, will you both go
and find Tom at the party?

And face those monster?
Please, for me...

I'm terrified he will hit
anyone who criticize it.

You know, Juliet was his idea,
I couldn't talk him out of it!

I think I'm still 23 in his eyes,
God bless him!

No one was brave enough
to come back stage.

I think they are all going to
need a few stiff drinks...

Before complimenting me.

On my opening nights...

As soon as the curtains descends,
I hop on the first plane out of town...

Wherever it's going...

But as you seem to lack
a getaway vehicle...

It's best just to put on
your finest false smile...

And grin the bastards down.

I'll see you later...

Karen Stone, the beautiful
Broadway star...

Who graced many a hit plays
of the last 25 years...

Took a fall last night in
a Broadway disaster...

That wass bound for the book.

Whatever possessed our lovely
and intelligent Karen to imagine...

She was young enough
to play Juliet...

Will remain forever one of the
great Broadway misteries.

I wish you wouldn't read
that Francis Down.

Send him a note.

"I don't know
what possessed me either."

"But I love you anyway."

Now, whose birthday is it?

Horace Oliver.

Ah, the columnist
for the Detroit Star.

Send him a telegram, the usual...

Oh, and say I'm so thrilled...

That he recovered from his
operation so beautifully.

Anyone died yesterday?

Apart from Karen Stone
on the stage?

Mattie Osborne, the Chicago critic.

Hearth attack.

Oh, flowers and condolences!

I didn't know
that she had a hearth.

Well, at least no one else
will be reviewing you in Chicago.

No one will review me in Chicago,
I cancelled the tour.

You know, I'm very worried
about Tom's health...

He's so tired!

I think he needs a long holiday.

Will you be returning
in a new play next season?

Gary, I'm afraid not.

I'm retairing from the stage.

Are you serious?

Yes, I am serious, Red.

My husband needs me now
and he's much more important...

Than my silly career.

So, we're going
on a long vacation...

To Europe and Asia.
I just want him to be well.

She's spoiling me!

All right, that's enough guys,
come on...

You wouldn't want
us to miss our boat!

Good bye!

Oh, you mustn't catch a chill!

Doctor's orders!
All right.

What is it, Tom?
What's the matter?

I... I...

It's just that....

I've been such a bad husband
for you these years...

When it comes to...

When it comes to the physical...

I.. I... am sorry.
I'm so sorry, I...

Listen: If I wanted to
live like an animal...

I would have married an animal.

Instead I married...

The kindest man there is.

I'm so sorry, Karen!

There you go.

I love you.
I love you...

So much!

It's all right!

Yor reputation here, Mrs Stone,
is of a great actress.

You must have been
talking to my husband.

It is unusual for a man
tro praise his wife.

Tom has collected every
newspaper cutting..

Every review
I have ever received.

I wonder where he is...

Oh, I'm sorry,
would you excuse me?

Christopher...

Baby!

What a beautiful surprise!

What are you doing in Rome?

In transit, of course,
it's always in transit.

Guido is taking me to Sicily
to meet his family...

A dismal prospect.

But I am finally working
on my new play.

My, don't you look lovely?

Where is Tom?

He has probably found someone
who understands Wall Street.

Meanwhile he has landed
me with some old harpy...

Who forced a card upon him.

Oh, yes, the Contessa.

She forces her card
upon everyone.

Contessa?
Contessa who?

Who knows who?

Everyone here has a title
with a long name...

Running after it like a poodle.

Eredited in her case I
believe, from an ancestor...

Who was a male whore...

Noted for the lenght
of his appendage.

Who received his title in
payment for services rendered.

It's a slander!
Well, it's true!

At least is gossip!

Baby, this party is crawling
with stately witches...

And dandies...

Who despite their elegance are really
just hookers ot pimps.

There's been a war, after all...

Remember the war?

You were playing in
"This Above All".

At least during most of it.

All that's left to Society
anywhere in Europe...

Is the well dressed people
with something to sell.

Ah, now, over there...

The most beautiful
young man in Rome!

Everyone fancies him,
male or female.

He is with Mrs Jameson Walker,
whose husband owns Texas...

He must be costing her
a pretty penny!

You're not looking!

I'm not remotely interested.

There are things in life
that are more important.

Such as?

Don't ask difficult questions,
let's find Tom!

Oh, yes!

Thank you!

Her name is Karen Stone...

Evidently a terrible actress,
but her husband is very rich.

This rich?

Rubies.

Oh, great!

Like a dove!

Oh, it's beautiful!

Shouldn't I have
something a little darker?

Why?

It might make me look
a little thinner.

Weight suits you, darling.

As does grey, trust me.

Well, how do I look?

Very handsome.

So how do I look?

Beautiful!

Absolutely beautiful.

Tom, are you feeling badly?

My husband is hill!

Tell the pilot, we have
to make a landing!

Your husband has fainted.

No! please...
You have to land!

You have to land,
there is an island!

Island!
Island!

Please!
Sit down please!

You have to make a landing!
You have to make a landing!

You have to!
Signora, please!

Island!

Sometimes you surprise me.

Is that so?

Is this where Tom would
want his soul to linger?

Tom didn't believe in souls.

But he was a christian, and he loved
theater, and this is the ultimate...

Christian theater.

This is where the christians
were devoured.

It goes with the territory.

I'm going to stay in Rome.
I'll take another apartment.

Can nothing tempt you
back on to the stage?

Only amnesia.

I have no talent.
Talent?

Why, talent is the ability
to get away with something.

Of course it was a mistake
for you to play Juliet...

At the age of Lady Macbeth...

That wasn't better than all that
white stuff and them pearls.

Well, there is as you know a
tradition of older actresses...

Playing that roll.

But it is assumed they can act.

I was charming and pretty and
I had a certain flare...

And an enormous ambition...

And a wealthy husband.

Not to mention one's youth.

All of which is gone.

Poff!

Up in a cloud of smoke.

And all of which, I shall miss!

Can I give you a lift?

No thanks,
I'm meeting Guido neraby.

Peppo!

Thank you for coming.

What will you do?

Hello!

Contessa, this is Karen Stone.

Thank you so much for your
lovely letter of condolence.

Yes.

Yes, very sad.

Well, I have...

Decided to linger here...

A while.

And.. so, would you perhaps...

Care for tea, or...

Tomorrow afternoon?

Lovely, okay.

Lovely, I'll look
forward to that.

Thank you.
Bye-bye.

You are in the right city, Mrs Stone.

We understand loss, here.

Do you?

In our bones!

We make up for it
with substitutes.

How lucky!

Here's somebody
I want you to meeet.

Marco!

Vieni qua!

Hello!

"A strange fascination...

"There's a strange fascination...

"That is coming...

"And takes me to a place
that I never knew...

"Such a strange fascination...

"Or is one infatuation...

"I am falling in now with you...

"Strange fascination...

"Carrying me away...

Thank you, Lorenzo,
that was a charming evening.

I must speak to you, please.

Of course.
Do come in.

You have a problem...

Yes, my mother.

Her stomach.

She has...

Something in the way.

A growth?
Yes, a growth.

I'm so sorry!

They must operate.

But there is only one
doctor in Italy...

Who does this kind of operation.

But he is in Naples..

And is very expensive
to send her there.

So I thought perhaps...

I know it is a big favor to ask,
but maybe you'd be...

Able to lend me
one million lire.

For my mother.

It would make me
grateful to you forever.

It would make me...

Completely for you.

You see?

Yes, I do see.

One million lire,
that is a lot of money.

I think you have
misunderstood my desire...

For companionship.

A lady does not like to dine alone,
it is...

A foolish social prejudice,
but there it is.

I've known the Contessa
for some time now...

First she introduced me to...

Marco, then to Luciano, then to you.

Marco had a sister, Luciano a cousin,
and you have... a mother.

None of you understood...

Take this.

And now, I will say goodnight.

Sorry if I offended.

You are nice boys, really,
all of you.

I won't be seeing you again.

Good night.

Good night.

And goodbye?
Yes, goodbye.

I don't understand.

I mean, really,
I should stop seein you.

Roman boys are so strange.

What can I do?

But...
They are so handsome!

Yes.

But vapid.

Like the colorless actors
I worked with.

But don't you think a woman
sometimes needs a...

What?

Love!

Define love.

Biting an ear...

Excuse me?

Well, that's only a pass,
then it proceeds downwards...

Contessa!

Cara mia, att my age one's thoughts
are primarily carnal.

Are you going to finish that?

Take it!
Thank you!

So, what do you think about it?

Drift.

What?

You walk into a room,
you walk out of the room...

In, out, what does it matter?

Drift.

Karen?

Karen Stone!

Karen it's Julia!

Julia!
Good heavens!

Oh, Julia!

This is so fortunate!

We knew you were here,
but not where!

Greg and I are in town custom shopping,
you know how that's like!

Yes, of corse I know.

No one's heard from you!

Except that you're
living in Rome.

But why?

It's beautiful, of course,
but is...

All falling down.

So old!

There's a little rumour
you're writing your memoirs...

No, that would be
a very slim volume.

What are you doing here?

Drifting...

Along with the breeze.

Karen...

It's a line from a song.

Are you all right?

No.
Well...

You must give me your number
and we can have a proper visit.

I...

Have something...

Something?
Yes!

In the way. Something...

In the way.

I don't understand.

It's a tumor.
Oh, my God!

Yes, I'm afraid it...

I'm afraid it's inoperable.

Karen.

You know...

I don't have long to live.

So you can see...

I can't face visitors,
I need my privacy.

Where is it?

Where is what?

The tumor.

It's in the womb.
Oh, my God!

So...

I beg you, I beg you
not to visit me.

I must go.
You do understand, don't you?

Goodbye!

Thank you, Peppo.

I was ringing on your bell!
It's you, of course.

We were just in the neighborood.
In the neighborood!

Of course!

I would like you to meet
a great friend of mine.

Are you Francesco?

Pietro?
Alessandro?

This is not I can see
a good time for a visit.

You must excuse me.

Oh no, forgive me I'm behaving
incorrectly.

I don't know, I'm just a little
lightheaded this afternoon.

Why don't you come in for tea.

We'd be delighted!

English tea.

I am Conte Paolo di Lio

It's a very distinguished family.

Have we met?

No.

Please, come in!

Signora...

Muoviti!

A beautiful view!

Yes, it is.

Exellent chocolate!

Where?

In the biscuit.

Oh, thank you.

So...

Why was it light?

What?

Your head.

I...

I discarded something
this afternoon.

What?

An old friend.

Yes, they weigh a lot.

I feel as if...

As if the airline lost
all my luggage...

And I don't really care.

But your luggage...

Did not have on it a label?

It fell off.

So now you are free, then.

I suppose.

Like a bird.

I suppose.

Weel, will you excuse me.
I got a...

You have an appointment?
Yes.

This has been a charming tea.
Yes, it has.

It was lovely to meet you.

Thank you for stopping by Contessa
and appreciating the biscuit.

Bitch!

It's been seven days.
Six.

And she hasn't phoned you yet!

She's very proud.

She's very stupid.

She looks in the mirror
and she doesn't see.

You must phone her.

Please don't be ridiculous.

The season is over, Paolo!

What season!
Your season!

The ruby cufflinks have been in the
pawnshop for five months now.

Four.

Not a single line.

Then your eyesight
is failing you.

Beauty is a cruel gift.

Like snow in April.

Breathtaking and then...

The sun is out!

I've not melted yet.

Dial!

Dial!

Paolo?

Of course I remember.

Your card is still in the hall
where you left it.

How lovely of you to call.

I would like very much
to invite you to dinner.

Well, how sweet.

Tomorrow night?
Let me just check.

Yes, yes it is free!

Eight o'clock?

I'll look forward to it.

Thank you.

Ciao!

Ciao!

Look what you made me do!

I had to invite her.

That means,
I have to pay for the meal!

It's not just
one season, Contessa.

You're wrong.

Not just one.

Good boy.

Thank you, Paolo.

I've made a booking.

Booking?
For supper.

No, no.
No...

Bernini's. I dine there all the time.
We can dance there.

My dear Mrs Stone...

When you are asked out
by a gentleman...

He chooses the restaurant.

Oh, no, but I thought...
We will go to Trastevere.

Pepisco's.

Pepisco's?
Have you heard of it?

No, no, I...
Good!

Then you will be surprised!

Mrs Stone, this is
Mamma Pepisco...

PapÃ  Pepisco.

Let me help you.

This is like a family gathering.

Family is very
important in Italy.

Do you have a family?

Not anymore.

Well, it is sad.

If we don't have one in Italy,
we create it.

It was my late husband
that was my...

Family?
Yes!

But now he's gone.

The Pepiscos come from a small
village in Nothern Italy.

You know, my grandparents had
one of their houses there.

The cuisine is very simple
but perfect.

Excuse me.

What were you talking
to her about?

I ordered!

How do you know what I want?

Please, Mrs Stone,
you must trust me.

I guarantee you
a delicious meal.

This is one of the
oldest streets in the city.

Can you hear whispers?

No.

Voices from the past
through the centuries.

Years do not exist
for us, Mrs Stone.

Centuries do.

I wish you wouldn't
call me Mrs Stone.

I have not yet the right
to speak you first name.

Oh, really?

How is that right achieved?

By dancing.

Dance?

Of course.

Well, is this an old custom,
one from your grandparents town?

You make fun of me.

No, I'm sorry.
Because that is what it is.

There was music every night
in the town square.

A violin, a trombon,
and drums perhaps, and...

You know what?
Close your eyes.

What!

Just close your eyes.

There. Now...

Can you hear the music?

No, Paolo, I'm afraid I can't.

Please, please, you must
use your imagination.

You are an actress after all,
surely you must hear.

Listen.

There is a tuba.

Oh please, this is ridiculous.

Nothing is ridiculous
if you believe it is possible.

There are coloured lights
everywere.

CafÃ©es, waiters and customers...

Men singing, women laughing...

Kids are running
through the crowds.

And those little flying insects...

You know, that have
light on their backs.

Fireflies.
Yes.

And the lights go on and off.

On and off.

An accordion.

What?

I can hear an accordion.

Brava.

That means...

We can dance.

Thank you, Paolo.

That...

Was an enchanted evening.

No, no, I thank you.

I'm a lucky man.

Tonight I dasnced
with a princess.

Hardly.

In my eyes.

My eyes...

Do not lie.

Good night.

Karen.

Good night.

I know that she wants me.

Why doesn't she say
or do something?

Patience.

Rome wasn't built in a day.

Perhaps not,
but at some point...

They laid the foundation.

Don't be vulgar.

And do you make love
to her every night?

What do you think?

You must have an important
appointment this afternoon.

No, I don't think so.

In New York I always
had an appointment.

One tries to be there
at a certain time.

Yes.

Here never!

I'm just free!

To drift.

She's crazy about me,
she wants to marry me.

But you know me.
What am I going to do in America?

And is she richer
then Signora Coogan?

Absolutely.

And the baron?
Oh, yes.

Mrs Jameson Walker?

Much richer.

And much more beautiful.

She's a very great actress.

Everybody in America knows her.

Lovely, lovely!

Much more... young!

Thank you.

Do you mind if I use
your telephone?

I'll pay, of course.

As you wish.

Thank you.
Ciao!

Stop, stop, Peppo.

I'll walk from here.

Va bene, signora.

Is she coming here?

Who?
That lady?

She isn't one of our patrons.

Don't you know who she is?

No.

She is the Signora Stone!

I disn't know she was
such a great lady.

She is not to great a lady
to take a turn at the pump.

If the house is on fire,
that is!

Is she taking him
to America too?

Where did you learn?

To sing?

No, no, no, all Italians
can sing, I know that...

No, to play the piano!

Ah, my aunt tought me.

She played for Ligechi.

He was a very famous tenor.

And he became her lover.

But his wife one night discovered
them asleep in bed...

And you know what she did?

She took a hammer...

And she broke the hand
of my uncle.

Oh, that's awful!

My aunt is a beautiful person.

Now I am unhappy.

Oh, no, no, you mustn't be.

Rome is a cruel city.

It is very foolish to sing.

It's good to try to be happy.

Do you think so?

Yes, don't be sad,
it doesn't suit you.

Why don't you play for me again.

No.

I'll sing for you.

A song from the South.

About a beautiful woman.

"Ohi, MarÃ¬...

"Ohi, MarÃ¬...

"Quanto suonno aggio
perso pe' te...

"Famme addormÃ¬...

"Abbracciato 'nu poco cu' te...

"Ohi, MarÃ¬...

"Ohi, MarÃ¬...

"Quanto suonno aggio
perso pe' te...

"Famme addormÃ¬...

"Ohi, MarÃ¬...

"Ohi... MarÃ¬

Two months...

And all you receive
is one necktie.

At least she buys you dinner.

What about me!

Last week I fainted
from hunger...

Smelling the food as I walked
in front of Rosati...

And the Americans there
were rapt...

And smiled..
They...

They think fainting is European.

And then they gave
a beggar some coins.

Enough money
to feed me for a week!

Mres Stone is a great lady.

A very great lady indeed...

And cannot be treated
cinically like Mrs Coogan.

There's no such thing
as a great American lady.

Great ladies do not
occur in countries...

That are less then
200 years old.

Your great lady was, I'm told,
an artistic mediocrity...

She does non possess
real dignity...

Real pride...

You are malicious.

I say I'm quite positive...

Her feeling for me is...

Yes!

Romantic.

But she's not a wolf.

She's made no move
to get me to bed.

I think you are infatuated
wit this Mrs Stone.

Then I think you do sleep with her
and then you lie to me...

And don't give me my percentage!

Go away, you witch!
You will die in the black market!

I hope that puts you
out of business for tonight.

Strangers come and destroy
this city all the time, cara mia...

Little bit for bit.

I understand that you've been seeing
a lot of young Paolo lately...

And as your oldest
friend in Rome...

I think it is necessary
that I should tell you...

A little bit more about him.

Do you?

I imagine you find him charming.

Everybody does.

He is the most charming
boy in Rome...

But there are certain things that are
more important than charm.

What are those things?

The true Roman qualities
are lacking in Paolo...

And there is one thing that you
must keep in mind about him.

He is by way of being
a little "marchetta".

A what?

That is our word for a boy...

Who has no work...

And no money, but lives
very well without it.

How do you feel
about such people?

Well, I have nothing
against them, although...

I am pretty surprised that you
know someone like that.

Make sure you get
your money's worth, cara mia.

That is my only advice.

I think that Signora Coogan
was very badly cheated.

Signora Coogan?

Didn't you know
the Signora Coogan?

She's from America too.

And last summer
she took Paolo to Capri...

And they say she was the
only one in the party...

That he did not make love to.

Beauty has a world of it's own.

It has a godly license.

I know it only too well,
I possessed it once.

And then the license
was revoked.

What church do you belong to?

None. I was brought up
a methodist. Why?

Then he will probably
tell you the story...

Of his friend and the
wicked priest...

Who operates
on the black market.

What story is that?

He will tell you
how the wicked priest...

Cheated his friend
out of ten million lire...

On the black market.

And he will try to touch your hearth
so deeply with this story...

That you will want to restore
his friend's losses to him.

Oh, I don't imagine I will be
touched that deeply.

I may be touched,
but not for ten million lire.

You know, Americans aren't
as romantic as their motion pictures.

What a pity they aren't.

That was a lovely afternoon.

Yes.

You seem sad.

I have a headache.

No, I am sad.

Won't you come in?

Would you like a Negroni?

No, no.

I don't want to drink.
If I do...

I will cry.

What about, Paolo?

A terrible thing has happened
to a friend of mine.

Terrible.

I'll tell you what it is.

He was approached
by this priest...

Who's very high up
in Vatican circles....

And this priest told
him that he knew...

About a lot of English and
American army supplies...

Which could be sold
on the black market...

At a great profit.

So my friend gave the priest...

Ten million lire...

To buy up a lot
of this stuff, you know...

But the priest kept the money...

And my friend got nothing.

And now, it turns out
that the priest...

Has spent all the money,
the ten million lire...

On cocaine and women,
so Fabio my friend went crazy...

He won't have his money back.

So he goes to see the judge...

And the priest,
and he said, listen...

Wheere is my receipt,
and the money?

And they said
"but you don't have a receipt..."

"Where is it? Give it back to me!"
said Fabio...

"Give you what? We never saw any!"

So?

When does your friend
need the money, Paolo?

I don't know.

As soon as possible, or...

He will turn on the gas.

No, I am in...

Doubt whether he will do
anything as silly as that.

Oh yes, he's desperate,
he writes poetry...

His faith in the church...

Is totally destroyed.

Ten million lire...

That's a lot of money.

What is money
when friendship is involved?

But when there is
that much money involved...

I think it's usually
more than friendship.

What is more than friendship?

Friendship is...

The most beautiful
thing in the world.

Now, who told you that?

What do you mean?

Did the Signora Coogan
tell you that?

The Signora Coogan?

Yes.

I do not understand.

Paolo, when the time comes...

That nobody can desire
me for myself...

I think I would rather...

Not be desired at all.

Don't come in, I'm not dressed.

Why did you want
to know when my friend...

Needed the money?

Because you are very young
and very foolish.

And very beautiful.

And I'm not so young...

I'm not beautiful anymore...

And...

But beginning to be very wise...

Buonasera Paolo!

Ciao Paolo!

Signora Stone!

Grazie!

Signora?
Grazie, Emilia.

Bravo, Christopher!

It's not a bad part
if I say so myself.

I wrote it for you.

It's a beautiful part.

Beautiful play.
Then do it!

Make one of
those legendary comeback.

Return to Broadway!

I can't.
Can't?

Won't.

You can retire from a
profession, you know...

But not from an art.

Then thank goodness
I'm not an artist.

Paolo!

I hate the cold sun.

I don't like it
when the heat is gone.

Whoops!

Indeed.
A handful?

I suppose.

I thought you would approve.

Beautiful boys and medicinals
like penicillin...

They should be taken twice a day
until the course is finished...

After which you should have,
in theory, recovered

Unless you have a lingering virus.

Or, shall we say,
a drifting one.

Walk back on stage in New York?

Cold New York!

There's been a fantastic
amount of talk, you know...

Sniggering hints
in the gossip columns.

You may have escaped
from the stage...

But you can't escape
from the public attention.

Anymore than you can
shake off the skin of your body.

There isn't anyone
who ever loved you...

Oh, who are these people
who ever loved me?

I want names!

There are thousands!

You represent...
Just a series of parts.

Never myself.

Is this yourself?

I have lived my life
without medicins...

Without drugs.

Now I know
the meaning of addiction.

Then baby...

You're lost!

Careful!

Ma sei pazzo?
Ma va' al diavolo!

Imbecille.

No, no, no, not in the car!

It's okay!

It is an Italian tradition.

Do you...

Do you love me?

I am hungry.

Oh, it's going to rain!

You don't want it to rain?

No, it will spoil the picnic.

I don't suppose it has occurred to you
that there are some more considerations...

Beside the amusement
of rich foreigners here.

That perhaps...

We care about our crops.

Paolo!

Well well, you rich American ladies
are the new conquerors of Rome.

But you must know this...

Roma is 3 000 years old.

Yes, three thousands!

And all of these conquerors,
all of them...

Have come back to the dust.

Paolo, were you a fascist?

I am an aristocrat.

Is that an answer?

You know, when I was 15...

I was already a pilot...

And I was the leader
of a flying club called...

"The Doves".

We would wear uniforms.

Oh, uniforms?
Yes!

Bright blue.

With gold doves on the sleeves.

Six of my friends...

Died on their planes over Africa.

I thought in the war
you drove the tanks.

Both, I did both.
I... I...

You never understand, what...

I travelled to Africa in my...

In your tank!

Plane!

I do not blame you for laughing.

We lost the war,
so we are ridiculous.

But you can be
ridiculous yourself.

You were ridiculous in the car.

Why?

You asked if I loved you.

Is that ridiculous?

Besides my family
and my Doves...

I've only loved one person.

And that was my second cousin,
the Principessa di Lio.

She was raped by drunken
American soldiers...

In Naples.

Now...

She's gone into the convent
of the Grey Nuns.

So...

Laugh all you want...

I do not love anybody.

Paolo?

As the shops in Rome
are still open...

Let's go to Brioni!

Get you measured...

For a suit.

Brioni.

Yes, for a summer wardrobe.

No, no, no.

I could not accept the gift.

Oh, I'm sorry,
that was a bad idea.

Signora Coogan wanted to give me
an Alfa Romeo fÃ¶r Christmas.

The colour of blood.

Blood?
Yes, blood.

But I could not accept it.

Because...

I did not love her.

Oh, I see.

But this is different.

Is it?

Yes.

The truth is...

We love each other, no?

I thougt you only loved
your family, your Doves and...

And your second cousin
who lives in the convent.

I only said that because
you hurt my feelings.

And anyway,
when you love somebody...

You must not listen
to what they say.

You must look at their eyes.

And feel their hearth.

What?

What?

Did I make you sad?

No, you make me happy.

The tuxedo...

It will be a work of art.

Blue.
Midnight blue.

The only midnight blue
tuxedo in Rome.

But the suit...

It will be the masterpiece.

Grey like a dove,
like my uniform.

Like the uniform
of my six friends who...

Who died on the boat.

Please, show her the material.

It's kashmir wool,
first quality, beautiful.

See?

Come on, touch it, feel it.

I know how it feels.

I am happy, I'm very happy!

Paolo!

What?

What?

Nothing!

I just wanted you
to help me me with this things.

"A tisket a tasket,
a little yellow basket....

What, ah?

Are you surprised
I know that song?

I'm always surprised by you.

Sing it with me.

No, no that is not
something I can do.

Why?

Did you not sing on the stage?

Oklahoma!

No, no, no, no...

I can make you sing.

If you want.

What does "tasket" mean?

I've no idea.

Sing it!

A little yellow basket...
Basket...

No robe.

I'm cold.

Come here.

Tis is not you.

No, no.

I want to look at you
in the light.

I'm old.

You're beautiful.

Beg.

No, no.

Beg.

Please...

What?

Please!
What?

Please!

The new colour suits you.

Colour?

Of your hair.
Ah!

Thank you.

Makes you so much younger.

Better then blond.

Blond is an American colour.

Europeans don't have it.

Of course we could
buy in a bottle...

But we have to be
so careful of our money.

We suffered great losses
during the war, you know.

Not just what we were...

But...

Our finances as well.

Some of us came from
noble families, proud families...

Proud.

Now we must beg.

Well, it is as bad as that?

Worse.

Has Paolo mentioned
my financial situation to you?

No.

Of course.

His mind is
on other things, you see.

The young.

Oh, the young!

I have no assets.

All the family heirlooms
were destryed.

Destroyed?

The bombs.

Enemy aircraft.

Oh, oh yes.

Now my rent has been raised.

The landlord is a communist.

They should have died,
all of them.

I thought...

I thought perhaps...

You might be able
to make me a small loan.

As a token of our friendship.

I'm so embarrassed.

Please forget that I asked.

My face must be red.

Only a thousand.

I thought perhaps...

One thousand.

Dollars?

Yes, of course.

But that's a very large sum...

In appreciation of...
What?

Of introducing you to the
pleasures of Roman society.

I would be happy to lend you
1 000 dollars, cara mia.

If I had it.

But sadly, my...

My accounts are tied up in
a absurde, obscure...

Litigation in America.

I do however have a
small personal fond...

And out of that I could
lend you 400 dollars.

400 dollars?

400 dollars.

You are most gracious.

400 dollars.

She spends
400 dollars on a hatt.

A hat to hide her face.

Have you seen her face?
She's grotesque!

But, what does it matter.

She is the victorious American.

She has better toilet-paper.

Why did you ask her for money?

As you are aware, my dear...

I usually get a
percentage of the profits.

Where are the profits?

Where's the ten million
lire she promised you?

She's cheating you.

She's not vulgar.

She's not like the others.

Anyway...

You will never understand
a woman llike her.

Are you in love
with this foolish woman?

Don't be stupid.

You know perfectly the woman
that I always loved.

Ah, I know, I know...

The nun!

This is a young actress
from Hollywood...

She's here in Rome.

She's between husbands
and unmistakably bored.

I could make an introduction.

I will let you know.

"Marchette" do not become
attached to their clients.

I'm not a marchetta.

Of course you are.

But a fading one.

Soon you'll be on the street.

When she's bored with you.

When she returns to America...

When she resumes
her boring career.

Don't you know that everyone
is laughing at you?

No one laughs at me!

All of Rome is laughing at...

It is a waste.

The waste...

Of your last golden years.

Paolo.

Caro.

You are not just another
beautiful young man.

There's more to you than that.

Is there?

There are new marchette in town!

Every day, new ones!

Prettier ones!

Younger ones!

I need air.

We are in the air.
This is not air!

Excuse me!

What?

I'm not used to wearing
such fine clothes?

Is that it?

Who's that boy?

What boy?

The one that follows you
all the time.

Have you not noticed him?

He's down there now.

Come on. take a look.

Probably some money changer.

The troble is that you have made
a spectacle of yourself.

What do you mean?

We're being pointed out in the street,
did you not know that?

It's you who like to show off.

And it's you they look at
mostly, not me.

You do not hear the comments.

Oh yes, I do.

My hear is better for Italian
then you think.

"Che bell'uomo, che bell'uomo",
that's what they say...

At the sidewalk tables.

And you bask in it
like a sunflower.

Your hear for Italian
is not as good as you think.

I did not tell you this,
but last week...

I was compelled
to challenge a man to duel.

Because of a remark
that was made about us.

What remark.

A disgusting remark.

You fought a duel?

Well, I delivered the challenge
and the man left Rome.

I do not suppose
it has occurred to you...

That women of your kind
are often found murdered in bed.

Well, they are.

Let me tell you something.

Last week,
on the French Riviera...

A middle-aged woman was found in bed
with her throat cut from ear to ear.

She was laying
on the right side of the bed.

There were strands of hair-oil
on the left pillow.

Yes.

Hair-oil.

Are you trying to tell me
that you are going to kill me?

Laugh all you want.

On three or four years I'll read in the
newspapers about your murder.

You will see.

Three or four years
is all the time I need.

After that a cutthroat
will probably be a convenience.

Do not laugh at me!

Sorry.

My mouth runs away.

Let me take off my
grandmother's locket first.

Yes, I've been thinking
about that girl, you know...

The movie star.

Bravo!

Angel Hunter.

What a stupid name.

Perhaps.

But I'm certain there's more to
be gained from this quarter...

Than you managed
to get out of Signora Stone.

And I'm not speaking
of anything strictly material...

What do you mean?

I am thinking of you
future, Paolo...

I am thinking of a career.

After all you have stile,
you have distinction.

You have something millions of women
would respond to on the screen...

Then, bring her with you tonight,
to the apartment

Why do you follow me?

Why did you leave the table?

Who's that girl?

A friend of Aldo.

And who is Aldo?

A friend of that girl.

Where're you going?

To get the car,
have you forgotten?

Forgotten what?

The invite at the Contessa and some
friends to look at our moving pictures.

I invited the Contessa?

Hardly.

You invited, or I invited,
what difference does it make?

They will be there in five minutes
with no one except the buttler.

Where?

At the apartment,
where do you suppose?

I'm not the Signora Coogan.

What?

I'm not some wretched old woman
with nothing but money to give you.

I don't know what
you are talking about.

Look at me Paolo.
What is the matter with you?

I want you to see
that I'm not like that.

Even when I'm tired and I've lost
all my pride, I'm not...

Really like that.
But I have said nothing!

In America I'm known
as a woman of talent and beauty...

Books are written about me
and plays are written for me.

Anyone who goes to New York...

Will tell you I'm not someone
to be treated like that.

When we get home
I'll show you a collection...

Of theater reviews
and newspaper articles...

So you see for yourself.

Yes, yes, I've seen you pictures
in the fashion magazines.

I do not like somebody
who has to brag.

You know, you are not
the first great lady...

That I have gone out with.

Last year I was all over Marocco
with Mrs Jameson Walker.

Who is also photographed
by fashion magazines.

I come from a very distinguished family,
I'm not just a mythomane.

I have a title, I'm a Count.

Years ago with married into
other distiguished families.

I would never be seen with
someone who's not a great lady.

It is...

It is only because of the war...

That I can't always
buy my own dinner.

Do you think it gives me pride?

I do not think this is
a dignified conversation.

It's terrifying, I suppose.

For both of us.

What?

The loss of dignity.

It is a scandal...

A sscandal?

Oh my, oh my...

It is difficult to shock me,
my dear, but...

She has shocked all of Rome!

But why?
No, please...

Do not ask me.

I cannot bring myself to
repeat the stories...

One hears about this woman.

I really don't understand!

Oh my, oh my...
Please...

I beg you, do not
force me to repeat them.

But what?

It's tragic...

She has descended
to the depth...

She's in, I believe...

What is the word?

An abyss...

Karen Stone?

She's in my opinion nothing more
then a harlot who's procured riches.

But she used to be famous...

I saw her on stage,
when I was a child.

Ah, yes.

Her mediocre career.

Paid for by her husband...

She's purchased her
way into prominence.

I thought she was good.

Of course I...
I was young.

And, now that she's lost
her looks and she's growing old...

She creates a scandal by throwing herself
in front of a younger man...

Who has no interest in her...

Whatsoever...

And now no one will receive her
in the places where I was foolish enough...

To present her.

But it will not stop her.

When Rome has been exhausted...

She will move to Tangier.

She's more pathetic
then the Signora Coogan...

Whom you must have heard about.

I do not approve
of eavesdropping.

Contessa!

How delightful of you to come.

Baron, Baronessa...
Piacere.

Oh, Paolo...

This is...
Angel Hunter, of course.

I've seen all your films.

I am Conte...

Paolo di Lio.

Signora Stone and I
are very pleased...

That you have chosen
to come tonight.

The Contessa is a devoted admirer
of Signora Stone...

Is she not?
Yes, yes!

I adore her!

Miss Hunter is filming...

Yes, of course, she's
filming in Rome.

The arrival of such beautiful visitors
to our city...

Does not pass unnoticed.

Paolo.

The Contessa's glass is weeping.

Good evening, Baroness...

Contessa.

Oh, and this must be, uhm...

Miss... Miss Hudson?

Hunter.

Indeed.

I admired you...

So much in... "This Above All"

Oh, thank you so much,
that is reassuring.

I believe the Contessa was about
to tell you about the Signora Coogan...

That ridiculous old woman...

We do not want
to hear about her.

Miss Huter, have you seen
the seven hills of Rome?

I...

Think only about four.

Then come outside, please,
and I will show you.

Would you like
something to eat, Contessa?

No, thank you, I'm fine.

A few crackers?

No...
Dip, maybe?

No.

Thank you.

I'm sorry Paolo wasn't interested
in the stories you might tell...

I'm always intrigued when you
talk about your customers.

Customers?

Ãˆ pronto, signora.

Yes, yes, we can start now.

They are just home movies,
forgive the quality...

I'll fetch Paolo and Miss Hunter.

Where's the lady
of the silver screen?

Gone.

Why so quickly?

Because I knew that you would
follow us out in less than five minutes.

So, I told her
that you were histerical...

And I adviced her to leave.

It is the third or fourth time
you've insulted me tonight.

First at Rosati's...

When you behaved so outrageously
with that drunken girl and...

Please, please...

I have a terrible headache.
Oh, do you?

So that means
you can't stay here tonight.

No, I cannot.

It isn't because of a headache.

You are going to take
from here to the Excelsior...

To keep an appointment
with that cheap...

Cheap...

Is not a word you should use.

Let me tell you
something, you...

You ought to leave Rome.

You have ruined yourself here.

I would not be surprised if
the Police refused to...

Renew your permission to stay.

Don't be ridiculous!

What I personally can not
tolerate your dishonesty.

Have you gone crazy?
No!

I have not gone crazy!

And I have not lost
my memory either!

I remember, last
February you told me...

That you were going to
help my friend Fabio.

Who lost everything
on the black market.

Oh, Paolo...

Oh, Paolo!

My friend need a lot of money.

No.

No, Paolo...
And you gave him nothing!

Paolo, please, I beg you.
You lied!

You are never going to help!

Your friend does not exist.

What`?

Can we tell the truth?

The truth?

Do you know how old Roma is?

3 000 years old.

And how old are you?

Fifty?

Fifty?
Yes.

That is the thruth,
you are fifty.

Why would I be with you...

Other then to help my friend?

I want you to leave.

Cara mia...

The film's very enchanting.

You Contessa
are a female pimp...

With a collection of handsome boys
that you dispose of...

To aging, desperate...

Foolish women and men...

And because I won't engage
in that kind of ugly traffic...

You just pass the off
to someone who will.

How dare you?

I am the Contessa.

Oh, please, spare me your title!

Just get out of here!

And take your
prize marchetta with you...

Take him to the next conquest...

Take him to the movie star...

Take him...

Get out!

Get out!
Get out!

Do you think you can cause
noble people to go hungry?

And then tell us how to behave?

Do you think you can help
the traitors who...

Hung il Duce upside down?

And then tell us how to behave?

Do you think you can bomb us...

And kill our children...

And then tell us how to behave?
