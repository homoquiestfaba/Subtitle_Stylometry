All I'm sayin' is that we have
to come back with something.

I know,
I know.

But I took this trip to
get away from the dumb wife.

Not to drag my butt
through the woods.

All we gotta do
is bag one deer.

That shouldn't
be too hard.

I should've used
fishing as an excuse.

Like the last time.

[birds chirping gaily]

<i>[screech]</i>

You hear that?

A barn owl?

It's the middle of
the morning, dumbass.

What...?

[bird chirping gaily, distant]

What the hell...?


Get down!

[man shouts]


[echo of man's screams
and bird screeches]


[loud screech]


<i>(male voice)</i>
<i>Left, Porky! <i>Left!

There you go, you're
almost there, buddy!

Turn left!

You know,
that's not funny.

I am trying to teach you
guys about trust and teamwork

so that you fledgling criminals
can function in society.

If you keep that up,
no rewards.

No granola bars or
raisin cakes? Boo-hoo.

Now turn right.

You know, that's it.
It's not funny anymore.

Porky! I mean, James!
Come on out of the woods, yeah?

Hey, Porky!
We're cooking dinner!

<i>It's counselor</i>
<i>on a stick!</i>

Save you a piece
of his ass.

Ah, I was just trying
to motivate him, bossman.

Why don't you
try to motivate me?

Ooh. Well,
I might.

Depends. What'd you
get busted for again?

Solicitation.

Ah. That's what
I thought.

No man,
it wasn't tough.

Once I figured out that
the teachers' logins

were just their name and room
number, I wrote a simple script

so they'd try out all
the different passwords.

Why would you waste your time
with the school's computer?

I would've used it
to get free porn.

Man, I already
did that.

This way I can
change kids' grades

and charge 'em
cash to do it.

You're here because you were
hacking into the school's computer?

No, I'm here because
I hacked the Pentagon.

But that's a
different story.

I can send email
or do My Space.

Hey, yo. I think I figured out
how you got stuck out here with us.

Oh yeah?

It's gotta be illegal to
look that damn good, girl!

That was the lamest pickup
line I've ever heard.

You know my
game's tight.

What's it gonna take for a guy
like me to get with a girl like you?

A lot more than
you're offering.

Oh, damn!

Hello?!

Guys!

Which way
do I go?

Where did you
get that cigarette?

There's no
smoking, Eva.

I don't know what
you guys are doing,

you can screw around
all you want in jail,

but not here.

<i>(Instructor)</i>
<i>Eva, Gordon, you're on kitchen duty.</i>

<i>so go and get</i>
<i>a campfire built.</i>

<i>Derek, Hank,</i>
<i>you're on tents.</i>

<i>You guys got</i>
<i>five minutes.</i>

You two,
go get James.

Come on, guys, court
orders, remember?

Do as I say or it's back to Juvie.

[mouth full]
Hello?

James!

Ah, he's probably
taking a dump.

You two
are useless.

Really. You two
deserve each other.

<i>James!</i>

Johnson, Derek, come on.
James is in trouble.

What was that?

How would I know?

Should we go see?

No. We
stay here.

Yo, bossman!

[birds screeching]

Run! Run!
Go! go! go!

[bird screech]



Hurry! Come on!

[girl gasping and whimpering]

[wood creaking]


[bird screeches
and girls shouts]


[gasping and whimpering]

Help me!

Somebody help me!


Somebody help me!



There you go,
all right.


<i>(Hip-hop)</i>
<i>Psst! Eva, come on, this way.</i>

[coughs and chokes]

What the hell were
those things, man? Birds?

Quiet.

Shh, quiet!

You quiet, man!
We're all gonna die out here!

I'm not gonna
die, Gordon.

You're not gonna
get me killed

so shut up
and follow me!

Aw, hell no,
hell no!

I gotta represent one-oh-one percent.

I gotta represent...

Shut up!

I gotta represent
one-oh-one percent.

[weeps
and moans]

Where you goin'?

I gotta
check it out.

[low roar]

Oh! Let me go!
Let me go!!

Shut up!

Let me go!

Shut up!

<i>Let me go!</i>

<i>Those things are everywhere.</i>
<i>So shut up!</i>

I don't care!
Nobody touches me!

Shut up!
It's Derek.

<i>(Loba)</i>
<i>What's the plan?</i>

Keep moving. Quietly.

What do
we do now?

Keep moving.

<i>Quietly, out</i>
<i>of this forest.</i>

I hope he
left a map.

What a hypocrite!

<i>(Hip-hop)</i>
<i>Hold on, you wanna smoke now?</i>

<i>Smoke now?</i>
<i>Are you out of your damn minds?</i>

<i>We need to</i>
<i>bounce, yo!</i>

Nobody's going
anywhere, not yet.

Maybe he left his map.

<i>I'll</i> have a
look. Okay?

Let me have one
of those cigarettes.

Buy your own,
dude.

You don't gotta
be a prick.

That's the last time you talk
to me if you want to live.

What's your
problem, man?

Damn.

<i>Got this.</i>

<i>Two shots. I'll</i>
<i>be keeping that.</i>

<i>And... nice.</i>
<i>Nice.</i>

A map.

Hard-ass finally
gave it up.

Brings new meaning to his
over-my- dead-body crap.

<i>Alright, I figure</i>
<i>we're here.</i>

<i>There's the cliffs</i>
<i>and that's the camp.</i>

<i>You're reading</i>
<i>It wrong.</i>

Is that right?

That's not a cliff,
it's a valley.

How would
you know?

Idiot, the elevations
get smaller.

Call me
idiot again...

Chill. She knows what
she's talking about.

If I want your opinion,
I'll beat it out of you, Hip-hop.

Just like
that, huh?

Alright professor,
where are we?

Look, we're here.

<i>so that's us.</i>

And this here is the
damn woods, all around us.

And the blue?

It's rivers.

So where
are the roads?

Maybe these
red dashes.

Backpacking trail.

What about
the black ones?

G-path. It says
closed to the public.

They stuck us in the
middle of nowhere, man.

Here. Fort Badish,
right here.

It's the Army.

It's a
historical marker.

So no Army.

No, but campers?
Tourists? Rangers?

Why don't we just keep
reading off the map?


Oh God.

<i>Alright, time</i>
<i>to move.</i>

Here's the deal. We stick
together, tell the same story.

No one's gonna believe the counselor
was killed by a giant mutant bird.

They're gonna
think we did it.

You don't
know that.

Yeah? I'm the only one of
you losers who's 18 now.

I'm not going
to real prison.

We stick together, tell
the same story. Got it?

<i>[rustling, roar]</i>

What about Porky?

We can't leave him here.
He can't move.

We leave him.

<i>I doubt he</i>
<i>would make it.</i>

You bastards!

I'll help him.

No, you stick
with us.

You wanna drag him along?
That's fine.

But he can't
slow us down.

Let's move.

Come on.

(female doctor)
You brought him in here?

Is he gonna make it?

Do I know you?

I don't believe
it. Jacks!

Dr. Hale. Good to see you.

"Good to see
you"? Wow.

These markings,
what caused them?

Beats the hell
out of me.

How are you?

You're the expert
on fish and game.

You don't look like
you've aged a day.

It's the mask. I've aged
ten years. So have you.

What attacked him?

Okay then. Uh,

I've never seen
anything like it before.

It's definitely
not a bear attack.

See how deep those are there?
Looks like he's got two or three.

There's no mauling,
just cuts and tears,

no canine bites, no feline
bites, I don't know what it was.

Well, can you
find out?

I'm not an expert on
animal attack forensics.

You'll have to send somebody
down from the state tomorrow.

He didn't say anything to
me when I picked him up.

He's running a fever.
There could be an infection.

Look at him.
Something's not right.

Look at that.

What is that?

<i>(Derek)</i>
<i>Closed.</i>

I'll open it.

Derek.
You go.

Why you gotta point
the gun at me, man?

<i>Just remember</i>
<i>what I said.</i>

Alright, man, we're
cool, we're cool.

Hello?

Cool!

Hey, send hard-ass's
pack through.

To hell with that,
tell us what you see.

I don't see anything,
it's too dark.

They must have closed it for
a reason. It says "Danger."

Hey, is it safe
or what, Derek?

I don't like this.

Yo! Guess what?
I'm still alive.

I'm going through.

Then you pass
hard-ass's pack to me.

Got it?

Yeah, I understand.

Don't even
think about it, trick.

[chuckles sarcastic]
What are you gonna do about it?

Hey, why don't you go smoke a
bowl and think about it some more?

Little Janie Pothead.

I'm coming through.
Help me, boo.

Give me the gun!

Hey, give
that back, man!

It's funny, who's the master now?

Who's the master and
who's the servant?

And I'm telling
you right now...

No! I'm telling <i>you</i>
you can kiss my ass!

You better shoot me
while you got the chance

or you're gonna
regret it later.

Oh yeah? Who
put you in charge?

I did.

I'm in
charge now!

You're dead.

Do not make
me shoot you!

Hey, Johnson, man,
why don't you step up?

Shut up, Gordon.

Why don't you just
put the gun down?

Shut up
all of you!

<i>Can't you see this guy
is gonna get us killed?</i>

Hey, guys?

What'd you
do, Derek?

Look what
you made me do?!

You shot the guy.

Yo, this is so
messed up, yo!

<i>I didn't even know</i>
<i>the dude's name.</i>

Hank, I think.

These crates are
filled with dynamite!

Oh, great. You idiots are
shooting off flares in here.

<i>[Loba]</i>
<i>We're all gonna die.</i>

<i>(Eva)</i>
<i>We need to get out.</i>

Those things followed
us here. They're outside.

We're gonna have
to find another way.

Oh. Something
died down there.


No, it's not that.

<i>(Loba)</i>
<i>something smells bad.</i>

It's gas! Johnson,
close the door!

<i>(Eva)</i>
<i>Dammit, close the door!</i>

Dammit, close it!

What is the gas gonna do?
Is it gonna kill us?

Not if anyone shoots
any more guns, no.

But in time it will displace the
oxygen in this room and we'll suffocate.

We need to get
out of here.

One of you
check out there.

Do it!

Cowards.

So what do you see?

<i>(Garrett)</i>
<i>strange, really strange.</i>

Okay, and?

Garrett?

Patience was never
your strong suit.

I save lives.
Patience is not an option.

It might save
relationships, though.

One in particular
I'm thinking of.

Yeah, two years wasn't
enough time for you?

Seemed like
an eternity to me.

Excuse me, Dr. Hale.
The bloodwork's back.

You're not gonna
believe this.

It's an H5N1 variant.

Avian flu?

<i>How?</i>

It's a mutant virus. It's beyond
anything we've seen or even read about.

Okay, the good news is
it's still bloodborne.

So it can only be
transmitted through wounds?

Blood, prolonged contact with
body fluids, sexual intercourse.

I want a full course of
antivirals for this guy, stat.

Rimantidine,
Tamiflu, everything we've got.

And Dr. Thomas?
Let's put him in quarantine.

Shut down C-ward.

That's gonna scare
a lot of people.

Just do it.
Please.

Okay.

Aside from the usual sex
with an infected chicken,

how do you get
this bird flu?

You don't unless you're a
poultry farmer in Vietnam or Laos.

We haven't had a single confirmed case
of avian influenza in this country.

And there's never been a case of
another type of animal infected with it.

So you have to come into contact with
an infected bird? Like its scratch?

What are you
getting at, Garrett?

Take a look
at this.

See the pattern?

Striations.

Yeah.

Scratches.
They're Scutella.

Scutella?

Scales. The only things with
scales are reptiles and birds.

This isn't
alligator country.

But birds don't attack people.
Do they?

Rarely. Maybe a small child,
or when defending a nest.

I'm just concerned
that they won't have to.

What do you mean?

This virus has mutated, which
means it could mutate again,

and become airborne. So forget
the coming into contact part,

we have a pandemic
on our hands.

It's the only way.

<i>(Eva)</i>
<i>We can't do this.</i>

It does kinda
make sense.

The gas, eventually,
it's gonna kill us.

<i>(Loba)</i>
<i>I'm startling to feel dizzy.</i>

Is that the gas?
Am I okay?

<i>(Eva)</i>
<i>He's... he's one of us.</i>


<i>(Johnson)</i>
<i>What us?</i>

<i>I don't give a
damn about us.</i>

All I care about is that
he doesn't infect me.

Besides, he's dead already.
Look at him.

Eva, for real though.
What if it's contagious?

You may as well die saving
everyone else, right?

<i>Look at the bright side,
you get to be a hero.</i>

Yeah, by letting those
things eat him! No way!

Yes way.

Please don't!

We can't do this. What
about feeding them his body?

I'm not touching
his body.

Great.

Those things are just supposed to
ignore us as we drag him out there?

I don't think so. We
need a moving target.

This is wrong!

You want a democracy? Fine.
Let's put it to a vote.

Ohhh!

That sounds fair.

I just know
it's wrong.

Thumbs down we feed sicko here to
the birds while we make our getaway.

<i>Thumbs up, we get extra credit for
being nicey nice and we all die.</i>

That's two for...

and two against.

Derek?

Derek, Derek, Derek.
It's up to you, man.

Two to two.

Sorry, I don't
wanna be bird-bait.

<i>(Johnson)</i>
<i>Good man. That's it, then.</i>

Three to two.

Sorry, Ace.
You don't get a vote.

Well, that's it. That's everything
we've got to throw at him.

I don't know, maybe
it's too much.

Get away.

Get away.
Get away!

<i>from the sky.</i>

Oh. From the sky.

They came from
the sky.

<i>Birds. Birds!</i>

They looked
like birds.

I don't know what
else we can do for him.

What about us? We gotta wake him up
and find out what he's talking about.

It's not that simple. You can't
wake him up while he's hallucinating.

<i>(female voice, radio)</i>
<i>Come in. Can anybody hear me?</i>

Park Service,
for official use only.

This is Garrett.
Come in, please.

Oh my God. I mean,
are you there?

You have a weak signal.
Can you hear me? Over.

I'm Eva.
I'm... we're...

<i>There were more, they
attacked us in the forest,</i>

<i>now they're</i>
<i>gonna kill him!

Slow down,
Eva, did you say?

Where are you?
What forest?

I don't know.
We're with a group.

<i>Kids from Juvie? You have to
help us, there isn't time.</i>

Let me talk to
the counselor.

He's dead.
They got him.

<i>Those things got him.</i>

What things?
Over.

It looked like
some kind of... bird.

They're still outside.
We're in some kind of old fort.

The map says
[breaks up]

Eva, can you
hear me?

Eva! Can you
hear me, over?

Naughty, naughty.
Where'd you find that?

In the pack,
where else?

I didn't see it.

Maybe you didn't
look close enough.

Maybe you were having too much
fun playing with your new piece.

<i>Give it.</i>

I wasn't trying to
hide it from you.

Besides, it doesn't
even work in here.

I got through to somebody.
Somebody knows we're out here.

I couldn't tell them exactly where
we were but maybe they'll search.

Forget it. No one
gives a damn about us.

Never have,
never will.

Speak for yourself.

<i>You know I'm right.
We're on our own, professor.</i>

<i>(Derek)</i>
<i>Wool</i>

Guys, we are armed
and dangerous.

What are we supposed to do with
those? Those ain't exactly Uzis.

Yo, whatever, G. At
least they're something.

You got anything better?
No. There's some more over there.

Give.

Arm up.

It's time.

Porky leads
the way.

When they move to him, we make a
break for it. Everybody to the right.

No! Stop them, don't
let them do this to me.

No. No.

Get up!

Move, Porky.

I hope you
all burn in hell.

You're our hero.
Time to be a man.

Time to save
us all.

You're not
worth saving.

I know.
Move!


Eva, come on,
let's go!

<i>Let's go!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

Come on, Eva!


Eva, we have to go.

Yo, guys!
I think we made it.

[screech
and shout]

Park Service closed that
fort down to visitors.

It was built
on a gas deposit.

Hurry. Without proper ventilation,
they won't last more than an hour.


Do you really think
a bird would do that?

Well, they used to be dinosaurs.
Maybe they're pissed.

You've become
quite the philosopher.

Uh, no. I am
a much nicer guy.

I haven't had a
drink in five years.

You could get to like me
if you give me the chance.

Honestly Garrett, it wasn't the
drinking, it was all that anger.

Oh that was
the drinking.

Now I'm happy all the time.
What do you say?

Could we talk
about this later?

Okay, doctor.

What I don't understand is how
the virus can multiply so quickly.

Are there
environmental factors?

Could be one of a thousand things.
Transmutation.

Genetic manipulation.

By people?
But who? Why?

Terrorists, maybe. Some renegade
bio-engineer out to leave a mark.

You think?

Oh no.

Feds?

I called CDC,
standard procedure.

I didn't expect this
kind of response.

<i>They usually send</i>
<i>cops right away?</i>

They don't want another
Katrina-type disaster.

It's better than
no reaction.

Let's hope they learn
from their mistakes.

Sorry, folks, this
is a quarantined area.

Nobody in,
nobody out.

I'm Dr. Hale, I'm the
one who called you.

I'm sorry, I can't let
you pass. I have orders.

Whose orders? She's the only
one who knows what's going on.

I have to take it
up to the EX O. Wait.

What kind of idiot would trap people
in when they're not even infected?

That would be me.




<i>Oh!

<i>Oh God!

You should have had that entire hospital
locked down when patient zero came in.

Before we knew what
we were dealing with?

Well, according to you
it's infected birds.

But the ward
is quarantined.

You ought to be evacuating,
not sealing them in.

You're putting more
people at risk of exposure.

I'm protecting the
public, doctor.

This country hasn't seen
a single case of H5N1,
let alone a mutant bird.

Letting people run in
and out of that hospital

is potentially giving this
entire city a death sentence.

Are you a doctor?

No.

Why don't you let the medical
people make the medical decisions?

This is my hospital, my patient,
and I decide who comes and goes.

Doctor, please,
let's be professional.

<i>I'm dispatching a team to the
forest where you found patient zero.</i>

<i>Based on their success and an investigation
to determine if C-ward has been compromised</i>

I'll decide if it's safe to
let the other patients go.

And those kids I spoke to?
They're in danger, what about them?

We'll find them.

No you won't.

I should go. I'll get them.

You may be infected.
You shouldn't leave.

The virus
isn't airborne.

We haven't been exposed
to any infected fluids.

Good luck.

Excuse me,
I need to see my patients.

<i>Sorry, doctor.
Nobody in, nobody out.</i>

He's my patient.
He needs me.

Nobody in,
nobody out.

Come with me.

You don't have
much time.

I'm under orders to use whatever
I deem necessary to ensure

that this
incident stays local.

What the hell
does that mean?

It means that if we can't neutralize
these infected birds quickly,

there may not be much forest
left for you to search.

[painful gasping]

<i>(Hip-hop)</i>
<i>Yo. Which way is the sun going?</i>

Who knows?
It's too bright to look at. East.

West, idiot. Which direction
it's been going all day.

I don't know,
that way?

Alright, so
that's west.

And that's
gotta be east.

We've been going in
the wrong direction.

That's north, back that way.
It's where we want to go.

Yeah, if the
city's north.

True, true.

Are either one of you
sure the city is north?

Oh! You're
both idiots!

Watch your
mouth, son!

Yo son, this is a
messed-up situation.

It's got all
out of control.

Where are
you going?

I'm going over there to
put some leaves over me

and hide in the grass.
I suggest you do the same.

He may have
the right idea.

That kid's a
survivor for sure.

He did crazy stuff
up in Juvie.

His pop used to beat
the crap out of him.

He did some bad things,
I'm talking terrible things to him.

Then tough luck
for Derek.

Maybe he's not the only one
who's had bad things done.

Hey, just because
we ain't got nothin',

don't mean we
ain't nothin'.

Got hearts that is true,
so respect is due.

That was terrible.

Oh, please.

Yo, we should probably
just keep moving.

I know, I know, but you have got
to keep your cool, Dr. Thomas.

You do your job.
You're in charge now.

It's spreading.
It's gone airborne.

<i>There may be</i>
<i>dozens infected.</i>

<i>It's only a matter of time.
We'll all die.</i>

I just can't do this.
It's too much.

Oh my God.
Oh God.

What? What is it?
Giovanna! Are you there?

Oh God.
This is it.

This is the start
of the big one.

<i>It's spreading rapidly.</i>
<i>I've got a husband</i>

and a child.
I've got a life. I can't.

<i>I just can't.</i>

You listen to me.
Everyone has a life.

You just have to do your job,
this is what we signed on for.

I just can't.

<i>Now llsten...</i>

Giovanna?
Are you there?

I've wanted to do this
since I met you.

You better make it good, it
might be your last chance.

Mm. I'll make it
the best you ever had.

Some punk pulled a knife
on me over 20 bucks.

The last mistake
he ever made.

Shhh.
I n the trees.

This time we're
gonna fight.


Loba!
Loba!

There's only one
of 'em, come on!

Let's do this,
we can kill it.

We can't take them all!
We have to run now!

God forgive me.

Halt.
Hey, hey, hey.

Look, this area's
under quarantine.

Ma'am, I need you to return
to the hospital immediately.

Um, no, I'm
with C D C.

Well, then show
me I D, please.

Um, I left it
in my vehicle.

With respect, ma'am,
that can't be true.

Okay, well look,
I'm a doctor.

I would know
if I was infected.

I am a doctor,
after all.

Turn back.
We have orders to shoot.

We will shoot.

I-I-I have to go.

Halt!

Halt, damn
it, halt!

Halt, that's an order!
Please, halt!

<i>(Drake)</i>
<i>Sargent Rawlins.</i>

<i>Your team will provide cover
for the Hazmat team.</i>

I want samples, I want data,
but most of all

I want the infected targets
contained and neutralized.

Yes, sir.

These infected birds have
already attacked and injured

one individual.
Maybe more.

So be careful.

Okay, guys.
Lock and load.

<i>(Garrett)</i>
<i>No known species of bird could do this.</i>

Why don't you try the girl again.
Maybe they're close.

This is a Park Service
priority message for Eva.

Come in, Eva.
Do you read. Over.

Hello? Where are you?
You said you'd come.

Eva, I'm here, where are you?
Are you okay?

We're not in the fort.
We're outside now.

They fed him
to the birds.

We did!
We just... we put him outside

<i>and they just</i>
<i>ripped him apart.</i>

And we ran away
and left him!

Eva, where
are you now?

Trees, trees,
more trees.

We're gonna die out here.
I'm scared.

Hang in
there, Eva.

Did you pass any landmarks,
anything at all?

We just waded across a
stream a little bit ago.

Cedar Creek,
that's good!

Now we can figure out what
direction you're headed.


What was that?

That was one of them.
They're getting close again.

Okay, we're headed
north, I think.

The sun's starting to
go down to our left.

Yeah, good. That's right. And...

<i>[breaks up]</i>

What did you say?

I said how many
are you? Over.

Oh God, it's
fading out.

Eva, I'm coming.
Hang in there.

No! No!



We have to
get out of here!

We'll go
that way.

No, that's east.
North is that way!

Do what I say!

Hey man, chill!

We have to keep
moving north.

Come on.

<i>(Derek)</i>
<i>Aw yeah! Yo, it's Christmas time!</i>

This place gives
me the creeps.

Wait.

Derek will be
our guinea pig.

If he comes out alive,
then I'll know it's safe.

Man, what is
wrong with you?

Ugh! What is
that smell, yo?

It's something awful.

This just keeps
getting worse and worse.

<i>(Loba)</i>
<i>It's bad. Really bad.</i>

Derek?

Derek!

Look!
They're great!

Let's see what
we got here.

Now we're in business.
Cool.

<i>[gun loading]</i>

Yo, chill homie.
We cool.

Go check
that shed.

<i>(male voice, radio)</i>
<i>All clear. Nothing to report, sir. Over.</i>

Steady as you
go, Sargent.

A lot of people are
depending on you. Over.

Roger, sir.
Over.

<i>(male voice over radio)</i>
<i>This is alpha team. Eyes on objective.</i>

Ready?
Fire when ready.

What the hell
are those things?


Hold your fire!

Hold.


(female voice)
Oh crap.


Report damage, over.

Sargent Rawlins,
report, over.

Come in,
alpha team.


<i>(Drake)</i>
<i>Rawlins, Sims, Whitco, over.</i>


Alpha team,
control your fire!

Acquire a target!
Report! Over!

<i>I'm falling back!</i>
<i>I'm falling back!</i>

Sargent, do not retreat.
Take those things out!

Repeat: you're not
authorized to pull back! Over!

<i>I can't make it!
<i>I can't run fast enough!

Sargent Rawlins, what
is your position? Over.

Damn it!
Rawlins!!

No!

No! Come on!
Come on!

Come on!!

[man screams]
[bird screeches]

Yeah.

Alright, what the hell
are those things?

Can this wait? I'm
kinda busy right now.

No, it cannot wait!
What are they?!

Uh, birds.

The sample was Avian.
They mutated. This one there?

No, I think it's
the next one.

<i>Now listen to</i>
<i>me carefully.</i>

These things
are smart.

How do we
kill them?

<i>Uh, birds</i>
<i>are tough.</i>

Their ancestors used
to rule the world.

There's another
possible problem.

<i>Birds will migrate short distances in
search of a new source of food and water.</i>

Short distances?

Yeah, 90,
100 miles.

<i>Dammit, there are 4 million people
living 90 miles south of here!</i>

<i>That's why we gotta find
out what we're dealing with.</i>

There's the road!

Gotta get to the kids, Drake.
Drake?

Hey, we could make
room for three.

I found another gun
and some more ammo.

Good man.
Hand it over.

That's funny.
The gun.

The gun, bro.

I'm gonna hang on to
this one, just in case...

something happens
to you.

Just don't blow
your brains out.

We have been over
every inch of road.

They're out there in the
woods all by themselves.

They're not "by themselves."
They have each other.

These are tough kids.

You need to rest.

No, no, no,
I'm fine.

I know
you, Garrett.

You do not think straight when
you haven't eaten or slept.

Why don't we go
back to my place?

We can get some food and rest.
Start again at first light.

I promised her.
I promised Eva.

Okay.

<i>Okay.</i>

Okay.

I guess when you
gotta go, you gotta go.


[muffled scream]

You okay in there?

Yeah! I just
stubbed my toe!

Whatever.

Hey, man.
So it's you and her, huh?

It's okay.
That's nice work, son.

Go to sleep, hip-hop.

Maybe you'll get lucky too.
You're in there.

Hey man, don't even
worry about me, son.

I always handle my business, right?
Oh, right?

Okay.

[clears throat]
So... um...

Shut up and
get into bed.

Stay on your side.


What's going on, bro?

Just waitin'
my turn.

What are you doing in
here that's taking so long?

Just doing what a man's gotta do.


Courtesy flush, man.

Oh well,
night, man.

[stifled whimpering]

Get up. Slowly. I don't want
any of that funky blood on me.

What...?

What blood?

What's going on?

You're a liability.

[heavy panting]

Get up or I'll
end this right now.

Don't do this, man!
Please don't do this!

<i>Get up!</i>

[screams and shouts]

Shoot it! Shoot it!

Let's get some
friggin' bird ass!

Shut up and aim for the head!
Now!

Yeah! That's what I'm
talking about, son!

Got a little problem,
don't we, Derek?

You're making
a mistake.

There's no mistake.
Look at him!

Blood, coughing,
he's got it!

Got what?

Whatever disease
it is.

He needs treatment!

No, he needs
to go outside.

I don't stand
a chance outside!

<i>In here, either.</i>

Don't let him do this.
Gordon!

Drop it, son!

Not a chance, Gordo.

We vote.

We all know
what to do here.

Then what's
the problem!!

We vote just like
we did last time.

<i>No. No vote.</i>

That's not
for you to say.

I say he's out,
so he's out!

I'm not going!

Stop it, Johnson!

You gonna shoot us all?
Is that your plan?

You're going to have to if you
send him out there without a vote.

All of us are gonna know
that we could be next!

Listen, you
pothead bitch!

I said I'm not
going anywhere!


Sorry, man!
I'm sorry!

No!

Oh!

Now we're gonna find
out if it's contagious.

She's right. Now we're gonna
find out, no matter what.

32 rounds of white phosphorus, sir.
That's a hell of a lot.

What are we
going after?

Birds.
How wide will our radius be?

The payload's good for three
square miles of shake' n' bake.

Do we have confirmation that
the area is clear of civilians?

Let me worry
about that, officer.

How long till liftoff?

Bird's up in
15 minutes, sir.

I hated this place
since I saw it.

Yeah. It reminds
me of home.

Let's do some
big game hunting.

With white
phosphorus, sir?

We can't afford to
miss this target, son.

Was it his
getting scratched?

I'm not sure.
Yeah. Seems so.

Do you think
he's gonna die?

It's not
looking good.

Then we're good
as dead too.

Don't say that.

It's true.
We're all gonna die.

Shut up!

I'm sorry.

Listen. We're all here
because we made mistakes.

But we're tough.

We're survivors.

We're all here because we did
what we had to do to survive.

What did you have to do to survive?

Arson.
I burnt my house down.

How did that help
you survive?

My father was inside.

If I hadn't done it, he
would've killed me first.

Only a matter
of time.

Hey.

Weren't you looking
for one of these?

What kind of birds
are we looking for?

You'll know them
when you see them.

Let's make another
quartering circle.

Roger that.

Would you like me to drive?
You've been at it for hours.

No, just focus
on the map, will ya?

We've been at
this spot before.

I know that.

Son of a bitch!

Maybe we should ask
for directions.

We're gonna
find them, Garrett.

I hope
it's not too late.

Hello. Anybody
out there?

Hello! Garrett!

I'm here, Eva.

God, I am so glad
to hear your voice.

<i>I think you can find us now.
We're in a cabin.</i>

Some kind of hunting cabin,
it's not too far from the fort.

Yeah! I know that place.
Now we're getting somewhere.

But you can't
come here.

Why not?

<i>[bird screeches</i>
<i>over radio]</i>

They're outside,
the birds.

<i>Waiting for us.</i>

We'll find a way.

I'll be here.

Listening.
Waiting.

Son of a bitch. Where are they?

Yeah, what
have you got?

I've located the kids, Drake.
They need immediate help.

So help them.

They've got those
kids surrounded.

What's the location?

It's the old
Bailey hunting lodge.

<i>It's on state route 17 about 3 miles
west of the north end of the reserve.</i>

If you really care
about those kids,

<i>tell them to get</i>
<i>out of there.</i>

Why? What
are you planning?

An air strike.
You don't have much time.

They'll be at ground zero,
they don't stand a chance.

Eva, there's a problem.

You mean other than
giant monster birds?

<i>I can't really go
into it right now.</i>

<i>Homeland Security has decided
they're gonna do an air strike.</i>

Eva, they're
targeting the cabin.

Us? You
mean us?

You need to get
out of there now.

I guess we need to
come up with a plan.

ETA, 15 minutes, sir.

Come on, you can do this.

Hip-hop, where'd you
get the extra shells?

<i>Kitchen closet,</i>
<i>lower shelf.</i>

Loba, grab
some ammo.

I'm not
touching that.

I can't do it without you!

[groans of disgust]


Go!

Come on, come on, run!

Hurry up!
Hurry up, hurry up!

Too heavy!

I'd love to join you ladies but it's
either help you or cover your ass!

Great plan
your girlfriend had.

Eva, they're not taking the bait!
What do we do?

They must like
their meat alive.

[birds screech]

Eva, the door!

Yo, homie! Where the hell
you think you're going?

Now he wants
to be a hero.

Yo, get your ass
back here!

You think I'm
afraid of you??

<i>You think I'm</i>
<i>afraid of dying?</i>

The hell with that!

Believe me, there's things
worse than dying, I know!

<i>You want some dinner?</i>

Come and get it,
you son of a bitch!

Come and get it!

Let's go! Come on! Let's go!

Run, run, let's go!
Come on! Go!

Derek! Derek!
No! No!

<i>(Hip-hop)</i>
<i>We have to go!</i>

No! Don't look at him, Eva!
We have to go!

Just follow the plan,
let's go!

Man, Derek.
Better you than me.

ETA, five minutes, sir.

There they are!

That's him!

Eva, you made it!

Garrett!

There's our fearless leader for you.

She saved
our lives, homie.

Calm down, Hip-hop.
I'm giving her props.

Hey, get
in here.

<i>(Garrett)</i>
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

<i>(Johnson)</i>
<i>That was them.</i>

<i>You don't see this kind of
thing on the nature channels.</i>

<i>Garrett, get in
the car now, dammit!

<i>Let's go, Yogi Bear!</i>

All right!

We gotta make it over that
ridge to clear the strike area.

That looks pretty close.

Yeah, it's, uh,
it's pretty close.

<i>Better buckle up.</i>

God, Garrett!
Look!

Amazing. Definitely
a condor derivative.

<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Here it comes.</i>

<i>You'll have</i>
<i>to go faster.</i>

It's getting closer.
Step on it!

<i>Hurry it up!</i>

Here it comes!

Oh shhh...

[screams and cries]

<i>(Johnson)</i>
<i>Shoot it! Shoot it!

<i>Where'd it go?</i>

I don't know
where it went!

<i>Shoot it!
<i>Shoot it!

You got it!
You got it!

[screams and shouts]

<i>Shoot the head!
<i>Shoot the head!

Garrett, look!

<i>(Garrett)</i>
<i>Hang on!

You okay, Hip-hop?

<i>(Hip-hop)</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm cool.</i>

We gotta get under cover, let's go!

This way, let's go!
Keep moving! Don't give up.

<i>(Hip-hop) I ain't giving up, old man.
Worry about yourself.</i>

We can't
stop, Johnson.

I'm fine.

Two packs
a day, baby.


We got it. Turn to the
right, that cabin there.

Are you certain there's no
one in this entire valley?

<i>Nobody.</i>

<i>If there's anyone,</i>
<i>they'll be toast.</i>

<i>I just told you we're in the clear,
now let's do what we have to do.</i>

<i>Yes, slr. Commencing</i>
<i>target acquisition.</i>

Roger that.

Whatever's down there,
won't be alive for long.

Bird One loaded, and
rockets live, ready to.

What the heck? What
are those things?

Steady.
Hold it steady.

Now! Take
them out!

Roger. Bird
One locked.

Drake! You're
too close!

Repeat! You are
too close! Over!

Who's this?

Go get out
of there.

<i>You have to give</i>
<i>us more time.</i>

We don't have time.
We have a shot!

We have
civilians, sir.

Circle around.

Get the hell
out of there!

<i>I copy, but you'll have
to give us more time!</i>

What the f...?

What... what
was that?

<i>[bird screech]</i>

Watch out!
Watch out!!


Mayday!
Mayday!

Get inside!
Come on!

So much
for our rescue.

Yeah, no doubt.

It stinks even
worse than before.

It's gas. It's the reason why
they closed this place down.

What?

We may have made it worse
by cracking the seal.

That's not good.

If we stay here, we
are gonna pass out.

If we go out there, Dr. Hottie,
those things are gonna find us.

Maybe they died
in the explosion.

Unlikely. They're way
too smart for that.

We're humans,
we're smarter.

<i>[bird screech]</i>

You were saying,
M r. Ranger?

Oh my God.

It's like they know we're here.

Two, three... five.
God, Garrett, look.

There's another
way out.

Through that
hall and up.

Up in the what?
Woods? They'll track us, man.

He's right. We need to
find a way to stop them now.

We've got about an hour
before we lose consciousness.

Take this dynamite
outside and blow 'em up.

We ain't got enough dynamite
to blow up the whole forest.

I say we fight. Either at the
cabin or we can do it here.

That only worked
because of Derek.

They divide us and they kill us.
We need to use that.

What do you mean?

We have to lure
them in here,

and then we'll blow the fort,
the gas, the dynamite, all of it!

We'll need bait.
Somebody to draw them in.

Everyone runs and
one of us blows the dynamite.

And boom! Damn,
that shit's ghetto.

It's suicide,
is what it is.

The bait makes
a run for it,

<i>uses a fuse to</i>
<i>blow the dynamite,</i>

I might survive.

<i>(Hip-hop)</i>
<i>What do you mean "you?"</i>

I'm gonna do it.

Eva, I don't like
the sound of that.

No way! Garrett,
back me up on this.

There's gotta be
another option.

It's down to us.
We're not all gonna survive.

It's better one of us
dies than all of us.

No, I can't let
you do that.

It's a good plan.

With one
minor change.

What are you
talking about?

It's crap.
Like I said before,

<i>It's hard luck</i>
<i>or no luck at all.</i>

What you gettin'
at, homie?

It's me.
I'm the bait.

You're not
that sick.

<i>It's only a
matter of time.</i>

It's not clear.

Don't give me
that crap!

With immediate intervention,
you might survive.

If he doesn't do this,
then none of us will survive.

This isn't right.
Let's vote, like we did before.

No. No vote.

It's me.
I'm the volunteer.


This isn't gonna hold!

You know the way, Yogi Bear.

Come on!

Go!

Thanks, bro.

Gordon, what are
you waiting for? Go!!

No way!
You first!

This is my plan!
I'll go last!

Eva, listen to me!

Don't make me come
over there, Hip-hop!

Tell me you
have a plan.

I do! I'll make it.
Go!

Go!

I'm right behind you.

[heavy breathing]

Hello boys.

<i>(Garrett)</i>
<i>Eva!</i>

Nice.

You guys hungry?

Eat this.

Did they burn?
Did they all burn?

It's over, Eva.
They're gone.

Is it true?
Is it all over?

<i>(Hip-hop) We made it, baby girl.
We survived.</i>

Can you believe it?
He was a good guy after all.

People can change.

<i>(Eva) I never found out
what you got busted for.</i>

<i>(Hip-hop) Yeah, I got
caught for shoplifting.</i>

<i>Shoplifting? That's</i>
<i>hardly gangster.</i>

<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to be gangster.</i>

<i>Gangster comes from</i>
<i>your heart, baby, okay?</i>

<i>Actually, my pop's a
podiatrist. I'm from the suburbs.</i>

<i>[suspenseful music]</i>
