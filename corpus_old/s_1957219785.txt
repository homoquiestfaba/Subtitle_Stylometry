throughout the entire performance.

The use of recording devices
and flash photography

is strictly prohibited.

Please make a note of all emergency exits.

And thank you for not smoking.

And now, introducing our
host, Tina Ann Carol.

(audience cheering)

On your mark, get set,

go!

(upbeat techno music)

Move it!

[Woman] Hey.

(upbeat techno music)

[Voiceover] Go!

(speaking inaudibly)

What?

I said I closed early,
we're a hundred over capacity.

Get the hell back
down there and open up,

there's a line around the block.

Fire Marshall doesn't give
a shit about this place.

Okay, okay, don't lift your leg on me.

(upbeat techno music)

Geno.

You wanna shut that curtain over there,

that beat's killin' me.

Five GHB, three Special
K's, six hits of Rex,

and two eight-balls.

You are cleared for takeoff.


Haven't I already done you?

Uh huh, three times, Johnny,
but you're the most action

this old girl's gonna get tonight.

Get outta here.

Oh please, just frisk me
one more time, I'm so close.

[John] Next in line.


(upbeat techno music)

â™« I'm rising, rising above the clouds

â™« Nothin' can keep me down

â™« I'm tryin', keepin' the hope alive

â™« I'm goin' higher, higher â™«

[John] It's Miller time.

(woman laughing)

(upbeat techno music)

(water dripping)

(faucet running)

Hello, gorgeous.

(punching noise)

(punching noises)

(police siren)

(squealing tires)

Shit!

[Officer] Just talk to 'em.

(police siren)

Put your hands up, turn around,

and place them above your head.

This should be fun.

Let's just give him a warning
and cut him loose, okay?

You kiddin' right?

(doors slamming)

Gimme your ID.

Look, I know what we
were doin' is wrong,

I'm not that kind of person.

You disgust me, you know that?

Sir?

I said, you disgust me,
what, can't you hear me?

Well?

Please...

No please.

Okay.

[Man In Brown Vest] Okay.

Mike, take it easy, let's
just let him go, okay?

Well maybe he likes a little pain, huh?

Look at that, see?

Leave him alone!

Johnny?

Do you two know each other?

Go, get the hell outta here, man, go.

(shower running)

(people chatting)

[Passers-By] That's the
guy I'm talkin' about.

Can you believe it?

(wolf whistling)

That really is sad.

(showers running)

(men laughing)

[Men In Showers] Here it comes.

Boys, look who's just arrived.

(wolf whistles)

Hey, baby.

(kissing noises)

Don't drop the soap.

(shower turning on)

[Man Off-Screen] We
got a problem here, John.

Nobody wants to be your partner,

and I can't fire you for being uh...

How you are.

And I'd never even try, you know that.

Yes, sir.

[Man In White Shirt]

is your own business, but this is a small,

conservative town.

Why do you want to do police work here?

Because, um,

because I grew up here.

Have you ever considered relocating to

an environment more compatible
with your lifestyle?

Aren't you lonely, son?

Yeah.

(door slamming)

What's goin' on?

[Mike] Hey, John.

What's this, oh Jesus Christ, man.

(men laughing and jeering)

Mike, this is bullshit.

I'm not gonna fight you tonight.

(punching noises)

(men cheering)

Hey, okay, you sure that when I get to LA

I can stay with you guys for a while?

Okay, I mean like, Gil won't mind?

[Man On Phone] I'm your
cousin, girl, we sisters.

Tad, if you call me girl, so help me God

I am not coming.

[Tad] Okay, okay, okay.

You don't belong in that world,
John, you can chill here.

Okay, so um,

are you sure you won't
mind my bird friends?

Of course not.

Believe me, I've got friends who fly, too.

(upbeat techno music)


Does anybody work in California?

Tomkat.

[Tad] Hey!

How are you?

Um, so, some things have changed, since

last time we spoke.

Since Saturday?

Um, Gil and I are sort of, over.

This is Julian, he's my new boyfriend.

[Julian] Hey, hey man, welcome to LA.

I really wanna be your friend.

Okay.

Hey John, I can see
by the look on your face

Tad's fillin' you in.

(crickets chirping)

[John] I always thought you
two were the perfect couple.

Well, I guess I'm hoping it's
a phase Tad's going through.

Julian is a psycho guru DJ we met

out dancing the other night.

He wanted to do a three-way.

And we were bored.

That's the last time I get high.

(dishes rattling)

So, they're both living in your house?

It's Tad's house, too.

For seven years.

I'm a wuss, huh?


Look, Gil, um, if there's
not enough room here

I can work somethin' out--

No, no no no no, I insist you stay here,

I've been looking forward to your company.

Oh, thank you.

I have.

(laughing) Okay.

(water splashing)

Hey, what's with the camera?

I'm doing a documentary.

You ever heard of Circuit parties?

Yeah I've heard of 'em.

Hey, are you a party boy now?

No, and I never get involved
with any of my subjects.

[John] Is that why you're dating a DJ?

(laughing) Eat me, baby.

So John, tell us, what are
your expectations of LA?

What's the allure?

[John] Uh, I dunno.

I just um, wanna simplify my life.

[Tad] Hey, we're invited
to a party tonight.

What? What party?

It's up in the Hills.

I told some friends about you.

I should definitely change then, huh?

Okay, well, I got

I got, is this okay?

It's cute.

[John] Wow, whose house?

[Tad] Some studio exec.

Most of the Hollywood Gay
Mafia's gonna be here tonight.

[Gil] Hey, John, when was the last time

you were at the aquarium?

[John] I don't remember, why?

[Gil] Welcome to the shark tank!

It's feeding time! (laughing)

Move out of the way.

(people talking)

(funky jazzy music)

Come on.

Hi.

(men talking and laughing)

â™« Just close your eyes

â™« And follow me â™«

Do I have spinach on my teeth?

Keep smiling, and
don't be seduced by any

shiny objects like credit cards, okay?


Hey, Mark.

Gil, good to see you!

[Gil] This is my friend
John I was telling you about.

Oh, are you really en ex-cop?


(funky, slow music)

(people talking and laughing)

(water splashing)

(funky, slow music)

Uh-uh, this stuff clouds my aura, man.

I gotta keep my system
clear to spin my tunes.

You know, I totally dig
that about you, you are so

committed to your music, you
know, it's like me and films.

Oh my God, man, I was just
about to say the same thing.

(water splashing)

Nice entrance.

You workin'?

Excuse me?

You know, hustlin'.

(laughing) Uh, look, if this

is your territory, not to worry.

Even if you were
working, I wouldn't worry.

I'm one type, you're another.

What type are you?

You'll never know.

Why is that?

I only have sex for money.

Would you ever have sex for money?

(laughing) Hopefully
I'm not that hard up.

What, you think only hard
up guys buy and sell sex?

Look around.

I've had sex with most
of the men at this party.

I even get paid to stay here.

Want a little of this?

You look a little uncomfortable.

What's that?

It's GHB.

But it's a little dangerous, you have to

make sure that you take the right amount.

Why would I wanna risk that?

Oh, it's worth the the risk, baby.

It's the most incredible
high you'll ever feel.

It'll turn your whole body
into a raging hard-on.

(laughing) Well, thanks, but uh,

I think I'll keep my hard-on where it is.

Okay.

Listen, uh, this is my card.

Call me if you get bored.

I love beautiful friends.

I appreciate you guys
helpin' me find this place,

I really do.

No problem, buddy.

Hey, here, I brought you a
copy of our local yellow pages.

In case you get a little bored.

Yeah. (laughing)

Welcome to a whole new
chapter of your life.

Hey, don't look so worried.

We live just down the hill.

Hi, how you doin'?

Hi.

(laughing) There you go.

Shut up.

(laughing) Go for it.

Shut up.

(birds chirping)

(birds chirping)

Come on.

(birds chirping)

(light, cheerful piano music)

(crickets chirping)

(shower running)

(swelling piano music)

(water splashing)

Coffee.

Thank you.

Uh-huh.

Thanks.

Mhmm.

What's going on, what's eating you?

You know, uh,

I've been more than generous
with you Hector, I mean,

I never really planned on our regular

monetary commitment here, I mean,

my lawyer says that uh,
I've opened myself up

to all sorts of...

You've met someone.

My therapist says I need to find someone

who likes me for me.

That I'm never gonna find true intimacy

until I try monogamy.

Oh, baby, I agree to that.

You know, you're getting
all this advice I mean,

what do you think?

I think, I think that we
care for each other a lot

but it's not gonna work.

I mean, I'm a public figure,
this town, they won't let it

you know, it's still a
very homophobic town.

Yeah, yeah, you're right
it is a very homophobic town.

So it's better you date someone

that you can pass off as your son.

(thumping dance music)

(car door slamming)

(thumping dance music)


(thumping dance music)

(dialing phone)

Is Dr. Montel in?

It's Hector.

Yeah, well I need to see him.

No, it's horrible, it's fucking horrible.

(crickets chirping)

(papers shuffling)

(phone dialing)

[Hector] Hello?

[John] So I uh, finally
figured out what type you are.

Hi, John, what type's that?

[John] Um, well, you're versatile.

Smooth, nine uncut, no
fats, no fems, no redheads.


Fine, he's cutting me
off, what am I gonna do?

You know, I really liked Mark, too.

I don't know what it's
like out there, John,

I'm not 18 anymore.

I'm not too worried about you.

You seem like the kinda guy
that always lands on his feet.

[Hector] I do okay.

You're lucky you found
me, I'm a great host.

Party treats, baby?

[John] No thanks, man.

I don't need that shit
to have a good time.

Whatever.

That shirt looks good on you.


[Man In Glasses] They're cutting.

[Man In Line] Hey,
guys, end of the line.

[Club Worker] End of the line, fellas.

[Hector] No, but I know Rick.

Rick is in rehab, back of the line.

Don't you know who I am?

Darling, I don't even
know who you think you are.

Back of the line.

I'm Hector, that's who I am.

[John] Come on, let's go,

[Hector] No no, fuck
that, man, come on, no!

Ah, shut up.

I'm not gonna stand out here
tweaking, John, alright?

I can feel, I can feel
it kickin' I'm not gonna

stand out here tweakin',
it's a waste of good drugs.

Take your shirt off.

No way, it's cold out here.

Come on, I can see the DJ's assistant,

take your shirt off.

No way!

[Assistant] Come on I gotta
get through, comin' through.

Hello.

We don't like waiting, man.

Man, I could play
your nipples like CD's.

[Hector] Play, baby, play.

Come on, you need to get us in.

[Assistant] Follow me.

Come on, let's go.

(men in line complaining)

What now, bitch?

Get inside.

(strobing dance music)

â™« From one to another,
they're movin' their feet

â™« From one to another
they're buildin' the beat

â™« From one to another
come join all the fun

â™« Leave your worries behind
'cause the party's begun

â™« From one to another
they're here in the room

â™« From one to another
they're getting too warm â™«

[Man In Hat] What's up Hector?

(men greeting Hector)

[Man In Blue Shirt] Hey
Hector, what's up, hey.

Hey, baby.

[Woman] Hey, Hector.

Go on in.

Oh this is my friend
John here, he's a virgin.

Welcome, John.

Hi.

[Woman In Blue Shirt] Well,
you boys have a good time.

[Hector] What's up, Geno?

What in the fuck?

You let everybody in here for free?

(pulsing dance music)

Someone needs to lighten up.

What?

Someone needs to lighten up!

I guess I just feel out of place.

Did your boyfriend
leave you alone tonight?

No, he's just a friend.

[Man In Green Shirt]
Well, let me introduce you

to a good friend of mine.

[John] What is it?

Trail mix.

[John] No thanks.

I don't need that to have a good time.

Let's see.

Whoa.

Not so fast.

You know what, maybe
I'll just try one hit.

How do you work it?

â™« You're only mine to have

â™« And you hold me like a glass

â™« I'm only yours to have

â™« If you want me to

â™« Put your faith in me

It hasn't, hasn't kicked in yet.

â™« Put your trust in me

â™« What will be, will be â™«

Let me try another one.

(drumbeat music building)

Has it kicked in yet?


â™« One pill makes you larger

â™« And one pill makes you small

â™« And the ones that mother gives you

â™« Don't do anything at all

â™« Go ask Alice

â™« When she's 10 feet tall

â™« And if you go chasing rabbits

â™« And you know you're going to fall

â™« Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar

â™« Has given you a call

â™« Call Alice

â™« When she was just small

â™« When the men on the chessboard

â™« Get up and tell you where to go

â™« And you've just had
some kind of mushroom

â™« And your mind is moving, oh

â™« Go ask Alice

â™« I think she'll know

â™« When logic and proportion

â™« Have fallen sloppy dead

â™« And the white knight
is talking backwards

â™« And the Red Queen's off with her head

â™« Remember what the doormouse said â™«

(crickets chirping)

[John] That was um,

uh, wow. (laughing)

Can I have your number?

Uh, I'm not ready to get serious, man.

A telephone number means serious?

In this town it does.

But you were great.

Too skinny for you, aren't I?

[Man Getting Dressed] No. Well,

look, I'm not gonna give
you the typical LA bullshit.

To be honest with you, I do
date bigger guys, bodybuilders.

No offense, Jim.

It's John.

(laughing) Oops.

[Hector] What are we wasting
our time for, I hate theatre.

[John] I'm just doing it as
a favor for my cousin, Tad.

He's filming a documentary.

[Hector] The way Bobby treated you,

I can't stand this guy,
he's so into himself.

Been after my ass for years.

So I'll show him he didn't
get under my skin, come on.

[Bobby] Well, when I studied law,

it was my job to remind
people they were in trouble.

Now I uh, help 'em forget.

[Tad] Yeah, well you
said you were closeted

for like, 10 years.

Why would you come out so radically?

Found out I was HIV positive and um,

thought I had a limited
amount of time left.

Alright, I mean I'll
buy that but like, what,

why would you go to the Circuit?

It's a gay man's Superbowl.

It's tribal, it's fraternal.

Circuit's been my family.

I'm proud to be a leader
of the Circuit community.

I've never felt so loved or so free.

Turn around if needles make you nervous.

Oh, no fuckin' way.

Why do you do it?

Do it for my fans.

Expect a certain image of me.

They pay good money and I
don't like to disappoint 'em.

It's faster than Viagra, believe me.

If I had a dollar for
every blowjob I've given,

oh actually, I do have a dollar

for every blowjob I've given.

(audience laughing)

Are you filmin' the show?

Uh, just the main act,
I'm doin' a documentary.

[Woman] What is the main act?

I don't know, I was just
hired to do a little stand-up.

Stand-up.

Yeah.

In this club?

You don't know what kinda
place this is, do you?

Hey, can I pan to you
occasionally during his routine?

I'm gonna be filming backstage.

Sure, I'd love it.

Cool, okay.

See you out there.

Okay.

Thank you, you've been a great audience.

(audience applauding and cheering)

Thank you, Linda Tripp.

I drove up here tonight in
my new car, it's incredible.

It's got it's electronics up the gazazz.

Amazing, I mean, it's got a radio,

you tell it what you wanna
hear, and the station comes on.

I said country music and
Garth Brooks came on.

I said oldies and Smokey Robinson came on.

Then a woman cut me off.

I said you fucking rude bitch!

And Dr. Laura came on.

(audience laughing and applauding)

Oh I see we're in the
right room. (laughing)

Well you're gonna love this
next act, unbelievable guy.

He's amazing, he's brought his two

politically correct friends with him,

to do a number that was cut
from Annie, Get Your Gun,

when Eric Rulen discovered that

you can get a man with a gun.

Here he is, Bobby Rocks!

(audience cheering)

(thumping techno music)

â™« You say, you say, you say
you need a little somethin'

â™« You say, you say, you
say that I'm the one thing

â™« You say, you say, you say
you need a little somethin'

â™« Need a little somthin',
neeed a little somethin'

(audience laughing)

â™« You say to everything you say

â™« And I promise you

â™« Before the night is through

â™« I'll have you singin' songs

â™« We'll be the morning chums

â™« You'll be wearing more

â™« But are you ready for

â™« Assume the position

â™« Assume the position

â™« You say, you say, you say
you need a little somethin'

â™« You say, you say, you
say that I'm the one thing

â™« You say, you say, you say
you need a little somethin'

â™« Need a little somethin'
need a little somethin'

â™« Need a little somethin'

That was bad.

And maybe you're right here.

(audience laughing)

(wolf whistling)


Oh!


[Tad] Oh my God!

(audience cheering)

Woohoo!

[Stage Manager] Come on, you're on!

[Woman] I have to follow that?

Of course, Donna Pelvic, come on,

they've had enough dick,
they're hungry for comedy.

Go out there, kill the people.

[Women] My jokes!

That's alright, do mime.

(audience clapping)

[Woman] Guys!

The grocery store doesn't
have a meat section that big.

Hi, I'm Nina.

I'm your stand-up comic for the evening.

Perhaps you saw my name out on the poster,

the one that read, "Big
dick, and then Nina,"

(audience laughing)

I have to tell you though,
after seein' that thing,

feel a little hurt, feel kinda lied to.

Makes me wanna go home and
just slap my boyfriend,

just smack him, motion
of the ocean, my ass.

(audience laughing)

You know, I used to go out with this guy.

He was like, "Yeah baby, I got 10 inches."

And he did.

In the drawer, next to his bed.

(audience laughing)

Johnny?

Hey.

[Nina] Johhny!

I know you. (laughing)

I know him.

Well.

Come on, look at you.

Why, do I look different?

Changed a lot?

No, you look,

exactly the same as in college.

Except, maybe a little better.

It's good to see you too.

Come on, I'll walk you to your car.

No way, so that's fine,
I'm close, you don't have to.

I'm walkin' you.

Okay.

This is so wonderful.

You make me feel like home again.

You know we should, I wish we could have

some coffee or something.

I got here with a friend, Hector.

A boyfriend, Johnny?

John, come on.

[John] I'll be right there.

[Nina] An impatient boyfriend?

No, he's just a friend.

Okay, well thank you.

Okay.

I'm here.

And we'll see each other.

Wait a minute.

Do you need a place to stay?

What? No!

Of course not.

Oh the cat, I bring the cat
with me to all of my shows.

She's a good luck charm.

Then what about all the clothes?

I'm goin' to the dry cleaners?

You can stay with me as
long as you want, okay?

What gave me away, the cat?

No, the litter box.


The cat'll have to stay
indoors, I'll explain later.

Okay.

(pager beeping)

Thank you for helping, Hector,
it's really sweet of you.

This is the last one.

Listen, my pager just went
off, can I use your phone?

Yeah, it's right there.

Who pages someone at
11:15 on a Sunday night,

what is he, a doctor?

No, he's a hustler.

That was my second guess.

Guy just stares right through me,

it makes my fell like Claude Rains.

[John] Hey, don't worry about it.

Just be friendly to him.

Oh I get it, Hector's
like tofu, he just kind of

adapts to whatever flavor is nearby.

Exactly.

Granted, you could serve a three-course,

sit-down meal on his chest.

Aside from that, what do you see in him?

Haven't you ever loved somebody that

no one else could understand?

Yeah.

My Mom.

You must be a comedienne.

(laughing sarcastically)

(brushing teeth noises)

(birds chirping)

These babies are thirsty.

(cat meowing)

[Doctor] Your test results are in.

These new drugs are really promising.

Your viral log, is undetectable.

You could be around for a
really long time, Bobby.

You can get this in Mexico.

You bake it at 375, 20 minutes.

You see, I made peace with
the prospect of dying,

I decided to fulfill every
fantasy that ever I had.

Holy man, I have.

I decided to live for today,
the videos, the shows,

the pictures, that's
why I started dancing.

[Tad] You call what you do, dancing?

[Bobby] Absolutely, dancing
with everyone in the audience.

Making love to a hundred men at a time.

And for all the ones I miss,

I have my own line of greeting cards

and refrigerator magnets.

Selling yourself to the
media is an art form, really.

(timer ringing)

Yes, now that's a perfect
batch of Special K.

[Tad] What are you
gonna do with that, Bobby?

(laughing) I'm gonna sell
it, and I'm gonna snort it

and we're gonna party all night, baby!

Let's rock and roll!

Pretty powerful, huh?

Why would he just walk out on me?

Maybe he doesn't like Special K.

That shit doesn't mix with alcohol.

Are you for real?

You left me for this guy?

Hey, you can't insult
me with your negativity.

I don't give you the power.

[Tad] Julian, you know
him better than I do,

can you at least talk to him?

I need like, 10 grand to finish.

Thanks.

[Gil] What steps have you taken

to see if that work's secure?

From what, from you?

Philosopher gardener?

â™« I wanna give you emotion

â™« I wanna give you a need

â™« No better lovin' you'll
ever know is waitin'

â™« A fever love you got comin' from me

â™« I wanna give you forever

â™« I'll give you all of my time

â™« You released feelings
I was supposed to hide

â™« I'll give you my life

â™« And I give you emotion

â™« And I give you emotion

â™« And I give you emotion

â™« And I give you emotion

â™« And I give you emotion

â™« Give you emotion

â™« Now I'm lookin' in your eyes

â™« I know that things have changed

â™« 'Cause all my gloves are down

â™« And I have no fear of the pain

â™« I'm better since you came â™«

That was the risk you took,
there were no guarantees.

Sit down.

Now, no one's happier than I am that

you've been given a second chance.

But I bought your life insurance policy

because you said you were gonna die.

I needed the money.

You needed the money.

I wanted a nice return on my investment.

I think, under the circumstances,
you owe me a refund.

(scoffing) A refund?

I put up my own blood.

At great personal risk.

I paid all the premiums on
life and on health, hmm?

You had insurance.

You had um,

cash.

You could do whatever the fuck you wanted.

Look, a deal's a deal, I'm sorry,

you gambled and you lost.

I don't even have the money
to give you if I wanted to.

(pages flipping)

[Hector] I thought
this wasn't your scene.

Well, maybe my scene is changing.

I mean, everybody seems
so big in this town.

[Hector] You think you're ready.

Let's go upstairs.


You know, you know
what I don't know, papi.

You're only young a
beautiful once, baby.

Just a few golden years.

With a little more size,

you are gonna be a star out there, John.

So hot.

Know what that feels like?

Everyone wanting you.

God, I love that feeling.

So nobody will ever mess
with you again, okay?

These are pharmaceutical.

They're very clean.

Like gold.

Lay down.

Okay, I'm gonna try one cycle only,

just to put on a little size.

[Hector] Yeah, right.

Don't be shy.

Alright, I want you to breathe in.

You're gonna feel a tiny prick.

You know how we hate those, baby.


God that hurts.

What's with the face?

Seein' if my implants are moving.

Look like a Picasso.

You are gonna be so beautiful, John.

I may end up breaking my rule.

What rule is that?

Oh, baby.

We've gotta upgrade your image.

(upbeat, funky music)

[Tad] Come on, let me just
get some pictures of you--

Hey, just cut it out, I don't
wanna be interviewed, okay?

Come on, I just wanna shoot you walking,

I just wanna shoot you walking.

[Hector] Tad, I don't
wanna be interviewed.

I know, let me just ask you
one personal question on tape.

No.

[Tad] Alright, good.

You're pretty open about
your career, right?

Do hustlers ever fall
in love with their John?

Is that thing on?

[Tad] Can a hustler
really fall in love at all?

Are you desensitized?

Hey, do you have a crush on John?

What the fuck you prick.

Come on, what?

[Nina] John was just this
plain, skinny guy, unassuming.

Who wanted to be a cop.

He was not just nice, he was kind.

He treasured me.

And it killed him to
tell me that he was gay.

Because he didn't wanna hurt me.

And I've not found that
again with another man.


Oh, it's you.

[Nina] Hey, Hector, you know what?

I'm Nina, I'm the person standing

right in front of you,
who's talking to you.

Cool, huh?

Well is John here?

No.

But you can come in and wait if you like--

Thanks.

Cooking, you can have some.


'Scuse me, Hector?

Why don't you come out
here and keep me company?

Look, I don't care what you're doing,

I really don't.

Besides, Johnny tells me everything.

And I'm not one to judge.

What the hell are those?

[Hector] Steroids.

Are those safe?

I mean, you always hear about how

they're messing with your personality.

Well I've been using 'em
on and off for six years.

I'm no different.

So you've always been this funny.


Can I ask you something?

Are you jealous of me?

Because my relationship with
John was over years ago.

Well that and, he's gay.

If John tells you anything,

he probably told you
that I don't like women.

Or ugly men.

It's nothing personal.

[John] Hey sweetie, hey you look cute.

[Nina] You know, hot date.

Has he been waiting long?

[Nina] Oh, he's on pins and needles.

Needles, mostly.

Johnny, let me introduce you to Carol.

I'm a little hopped-up.

[Hector] Oh, it's the juice.

Here, take a Xanax.

You can coast until we get to the club.

Now what?

Is the door locked?

[John] Yeah, she won't come in.

Good.

Because nobody can know about this.

Wait, hey, shit, caught
me, I don't do heavy drugs.

Okay, I really don't.

This is just too much, okay?

I'm an ex-cop for Christ's sakes.

Would you shut up?

It's not heroin.

You little bitch. (chuckling)

What is it, makeup?

[Hector] No no no, these are the

best cosmetics money can buy.

I have a friend who worked for Cher.

Anyway, blah blah blah.

Enough about me.

How long have you been a lawyer, Andy?

Well, for three--


Guys, I would like you to
meet my date, Andy French.

Hi, nice to meet you.

[Andy] Hello.

[Nina] This is my roommate, John.

And his friend.

Nice to meet you.

And they're on their
way to a um, bar mitzvah.


Actually no, they're gonna be in the

community production of CATS?

Actually, Andy French,
we're going to the Probe.

Oh, well, nice to meet you gentlemen.

Yes, nice to meet you too, Andy.

Hey take good care of her, okay?

[Andy] Oh yeah.

See you later, Nina.

What's um, the Probe?

(thumping music)

Okay.

Fuck.

Shit.

Fuckin' can't.


(crowd cheering and clapping)

(crowd chanting) Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

Okay, let's rock and roll!

Fuck.

(yelling in pain)

Oh, Jesus, fuck.

Fuck!

[Woman] A little
hypocritical, don't you think?

What are you getting at, Louise?

You sell the drugs,
which compromise judgement,

which causes the unprotected sex,

that contributes to AIDS
in these younger kids.

We give them the condoms, don't we?

They throw the condoms away, Geno.

(water trickling)

(light, fun music)

[Tad] How'd you feel when
you heard about the HIV, Bobby?

Like shit.

Year that followed I
maxed out my credit cards.

I started writing my own will.

I declared bankruptcy.

Started planning my own funeral.

But now I'm not goin' anywhere,

so I wanna start over again.

Get outta the sex scene, quit doin' drugs.

Maybe even, go back to school.

Oh, this is perfect.

This is perfect, I wanna
wear this at a White Party,

What do you think, Tad, huh?

Yeah, this is perfect.

This is perfect.

What a rich character.

I want to apologize for
my behavior from before.

I've just been so damn frustrated

by this horrible plague, you know?

Lost so many of my wonderful friends.

I'd be happy to advance
you the five grand.

In fact, I wanna see
every piece of footage

that you shoot from here on out.

His story is, terribly compelling.

[Tad] I have great news!

We have to talk.

[Tad] Okay, okay, well let me go first.

That's what I wanna tell you.

I want you to go.

What?

I want you guys to move.

I want my house back.

We can't afford to live
like this on our own!

Well then tell that to Stevie Wonder.

Can I at least finish my film?

Tad, you've been working on
a documentary for two years.

I know, but now I almost have

all the money I need to finish it!

Great, then I know
you have first and last.

Can we at least wait
'til after the White Party,

he makes a fortune on that weekend.

Look, I'm not asking
you as a friend, okay,

I'm asking you as an artist,
I gotta finish my project.



[Hector] Yo Geno,

I need to talk to you about a loan.

[Geno] The fuck am I,
the Bank of West Hollywood?

Why are you limping?

[Hector] Calf implants.

Geno, I need another operation.

What is it this time, a
penile implant? (laughing)

(laughing) We can't all be
as naturally hung as Bobby.

[Geno] How well do you know Bobby?

[Hector] He's always been after my ass.

Even wants me to perform with him.

With or without an audience.

[Geno] You ever have sex with him?

[Hector] No.

I don't have sex for free.

I'll pay you to have sex with him.

Why, you wanna watch?

I thought you were straight.

I'll front you the
money under one condition.

You have sex with him at the White Party.

Sometime over that weekend.

You let me supply the treats.

[Nina] You seem kinda
different than his other friends.

You've been friends with
John for a long time, right?

Yep.

Then I guess you know he's in trouble.

Yeah.

Never looked better.

Or seemed more unstable.

(upbeat dance music)

Haven't I already done you?

Uh-huh, three times Johnny,
but you're the most action

this old girl's gonna get tonight.

Get outta here.

Oh please, just frisk me
one more time, I'm so close.

[Johnny] Next in line!

Wait wait wait, come here.

'Scuse me.

You know we don't allow drugs here.

Oh come on, give me a break.

You know what kinda party this is.

Very sexy, though.

(upbeat dance music)

It's Miller Time.


(toilet flushing)

Caught you.

Would you believe um, allergy medicine?

We've um, met

before, you know.

Yeah.

You're Johnny Webster, from Illinois.

You don't remember me, do you?

Remember?

You caught me with my pants
down in an alley one night.

That wasn't me.

You let me off, but I never
got the chance to thank you.

For that.

I'm tellin' you it wasn't me, okay, so.

You should get outta here, huh?

Yes it was you.

Get the fuck outta here!

(birds chirping)

You didn't come home again last night.

[John] I was at a party.

Hey, John!

[John] Hey!

Lately it seems like
you're always at a party.

Maybe you should take some down time.

Johnny boy, yo, how's it goin'?

[John] Good, man, you?

My man!

[John] Ah, forever!

Great party last night.

You know there's some
really good movies out lately,

I was thinkin' that maybe we could go--

Hey, bud, what you know?

[John] Not much, boss, the same.

Okay, how do you know so many people?

They're Circuit boys.

[Nina] So what does that make you?

I guess one of 'em.

[Nina] No no.

You are so much more than a circus boy.

Circuit boy.

[Nina] Whatever.

You're a peace officer.

You graduated with honors, you have

skills that can save lives.

And thus far, have been one
of the great loves of my life.

I can give that up.

I can support you.

Living your life whatever
way you wanna live it,

but not this, not the circus.

Circuit.

Circus.

Um, I remember going to
my very first Circuit party

in Atlanta, called Hotlanta.

And I remember being in
this sea of gorgeous men.

And out of the corner of my
eye, I spotted my shrink.

Doing Special K.

How do you go back to your shrink

after you've seen him in a K hole?

[Tad] Okay.

Okay, so, just act natural.

Okay.

[Tad] Ask you questions.

About the Circuit, okay?

Yeah, okay.

Wait a minute.

Cool?

Okay.

So, John, what's the biggest difference

between back home and LA?

[John] Wow.

I mean, it's like, it's like um.

It's like LA. (laughing)

It's the, so it's like the guys, as a,

what are those jokes
real quick, so funny uh.

And the music, you know?

(incoherent mumbling)

The gyms, you know uh,

everybody's always workin'
out, and fuckin' ripped


What?


[Tad] John, it's one o'clock

in the afternoon, are you high?

No!

Oh well yeah, I had a little bump.


[Tad] John, it's okay to party, man,

but you gotta learn to deal
with this stuff in small doses--

I've worked my fuckin'
ass off my whole life, okay?

This is my time, this
is my summer vacation.

I just wanna have a little
fun, is that so wrong?

[Tad] No, but that
shit is dangerous, okay?

Look, I at least know how to handle it.

Fuck you!

Yeah you handled it real well!

Cost you your relationship with Gil.

I think John was clearly not ready

for what he was gonna face in LA,

and he came with a small town,
this is fuckin' ridiculous.

(upbeat dance music)

Where are you going?

Green Party, goodnight.

You're not driving, are you?

Sure.


Come in.

Do a rat's tail.

Hey.

Did you do these?

In another life.

These are beautiful.

Why'd you give it up?

Every client I had wanted to fuck me.

That way I still charge,
but I save on film.

Come over here, lemme
introduce you to Tina.

Thank you, sir.

Nothin'.

(fast-paced, upbeat music)

I'm still flyin', I'm
not ready to go home yet.

How you doin'?


Oh God, I feel so good right now.

Hey.

(swelling music)

(pager beeping)

Oh it's just my favorite hotel.

My best customer's in town.

He likes to watch another couple.

You into it?

Uh, it's kinda late, I'm pretty tired.

Alright, I'll call someone else.

What's he look like?

You won't see him.

I've never even seen him.

But it's 500 each.

To make love to me.

I don't know, man.

Alright.

Listen, you don't mind if I call.

Only be like an hour.

Then you can pick me up later.

Gimme that.

Let's go.

[Hector] Alright, it's
a suite, we're gonna

go into the bedroom and
take our clothes off.

He'll be in the bathroom.

Don't say anything, and don't look at him.

He likes me to be on top.

[John] Yeah, right, bastard.

What makes you think I can be a bottom?


[Hector] Just a hunch.

Listen, remind me to lead, when it's over,

we'll get dressed, we'll
get our clothes on,

we'll get the fuck out of here.

Listen, babe, don't worry,
I'll take care of you, alright?

(fast-paced drum music)

It's okay, baby.

It's okay.

It's okay, John.

Just relax.

Oh yeah.

(fast-paced drum music)

What's wrong?

Nothin', nothin'.

This is, thanks.

This is great.

You sure you're okay?

Yeah, of course.

I mean, it was fun, it was,
it was a lot of fun, right?

Alright.

I mean, we finally made it together, baby.

You are so hot, John.

You wanna go to an after-hours?

Ah, no thanks, man, I just,

I just got this splitting headache,

so I think I'm just gonna head home.

You wanna come in?

You won't be able to sleep.

You actually like doing this, don't you?

This is like, the only
way you can get off.

I don't do anything I don't wanna do,

I'm not ashamed of my life.

(fast-paced techno music)



[John] Hey, hey, get out!

Get the fuck outta there!

What are you doin' in
there, get the fuck out!

(cat yowling)

God damn it!

(cat yowling)

Son of a bitch!

Johnny?

[John] God damn it!

What are you doing, what are you,

what did you do, God damn it.

(cat yowling)

Jesus fuckin' Christ!

[Nina] John, stop it, leave him alone!

You stupid cat, fuck you!

[Nina] Johnny, stop it!

Johnny it's my cat,
Johnny it's all I've got!

Fuck, he's just a fuckin'.

Just gimme my cat.

I had an abusive boyfriend.

And it was safer on the streets,

you know, that way he couldn't find me.

[Tad] Do you think you could ever

end up in a situation like that again?

Impossible.


Like I got anywhere else to go.

(dialing phone)

(phone ringing)

Hello?

Hey, it's John.

What's wrong with your voice?

Um I thought, you know,
you might like to come over.

[Gil] Well I was about to go for a run,

you wanna come with me?

[John] Run over here if you want to.


It's for me.

[Gil] Hey.

What are you doing?

What do you think I'm doing?

I think you're hot.

You're tweaking.

Do you really think this is flattering?

What's the matter, baby?

Huh, what are you playing hard to get?

Johnny, you are a terrific person,

if you only knew how I dreamed
about getting close to you.

[John] So go ahead.

Get close to me.

Not like this.

(water running)

We have to talk.

You guys have 'til the end of
the month to find a new place.

You said we could wait
'til after the White Party.

We'll I'm changing
it to the Plaid Party.

And that's next week.

Thank God I came to my senses.

There's no such thing as a Plaid Party.

Could you help me here?

[John] Hey.

Nina, I said I was sorry, okay?

I mean this, this hasn't
been me lately so um,

just come on back inside.

Is this everything?

Yeah.

Why are you doin' this?

I mean I don't,

I don't want you to move out, I mean,

you don't have to move out.

[Nina] Yes, I do.

You're getting worse, and I'm not

gonna hang around and watch.

I have a couple of bad days,

and all of sudden you're bailing?

You are fucking fooling
yourself, you know that?

Your life is going to shit.

You're trashing your body.

You're out all night, every night,

and all you can think about
is when the next party is.

You don't want my help, fine.

Don't take it.

But you know what, get it from somebody.

Because at the rate you're going,

there's not gonna be
very many parties left.

I can show you addicts in the Circuit,

and addicts in the Catholic Church.

I get tired when people
pinpoint drug addiction

on Circuit parties.

I get pissed when the critics all

blame everything on the sex and the drugs.

My lover and I are completely monogamous.

And we don't even touch narcotics.

On a scale of one to ten, a ten.

This is really good, Tad.

How much do you need to finish it?

Another five grand.

[Geno] Ah, gee Tad, I'm
sorry, I'm all tapped out.

But I would like to see some
more footage of Bobby, though.

(breathing heavily)

[Voiceover] Well
you're just gonna have to

take care of Mommy 'til I get there.

Tomorrow, yeah, in the afternoon.

Uh, ask Mommy if you
can come to the airport.

Um.

Okay, yes, alright.

Look, when I get back tomorrow, we'll

go to FAO Schwartz, you can
pick out anything you want.

Okay, within reason.

Uh, yeah, you can go on the website now.

Uh, listen, sport, I gotta go now um.

No, just tell Mommy that uh, that I'll

see her at the terminal tomorrow.

I love you too, okay, bye.

Um, this isn't gonna work.

You're way too old.

Well fuck you too.

You're a fuckin' hooker.

(phone beeping)

[Hector] John, it's me pick up.

John, pick up the fucking phone!

John please, you gotta pick
up, I'm desperate here.

Look, I'm sorry I blew it with you John,

but you gotta understand
you've got everything.

You know, you're educated,

you're smart.

You have friends.

Now I never had any of--

I don't feel anything.

I don't feel anything, John.

I don't feel anything.


I came to apply for a job.

Gil, thanks for helpin' me, man.

I really needed the work.

[Gil] You are welcome, I needed you.

I mean, I needed the help.

So, how did you get through it?

Through what?

I don't know.

Being gay.

Having all this incredible freedom.

How come you didn't get caught
up in the big, bad Circuit?

I had my party days, believe me.

Remember disco?

Things were more covert back then.

You really felt like you were
getting away with something.

Nowadays you have to party harder.

Get higher just to
capture the same feeling.

Do you ever wanna relive those days?

It gets repetitive after a while.

And I wanted to focus on
more long-term things.

That's when I started dating Tad.


(fast-paced dance music)


(horse whinnying)

I'm a bottom, why is there such a stigma

about being a bottom?

I think 90% of West Hollywood, bottoms.

(calm, relaxing music)

(water splashing)

What, what's wrong?

I just, I quit the juice,
so my body feels soft.

Doesn't feel soft to me.

Fuck.

I can't make love unless
my body's perfect,

it's so fucked up.

Well.

We can just hold each other for now.

Okay?

Simple.

(crickets chirping)

It is so good to have you back, baby.

You wanna go out later?

No thanks, I can't,
I got plans with Gil.

(upbeat music)

(slow, romantic music)

I like this chapter.


Hey.

I take it you're not
diggin' ditches today.

[John] Oh I got my meeting with Geno.

The White Party's next week,

I told him I'd supervise security.

You're workin' another party?

Yeah, I mean, I can make over two grand.

[Gil] Jesus, Johnny.

You won't survive the weekend,

you'll be right back where you started.

You don't get it, I
need to pay rent, Gil.

[Gil] I'll loan you the money for rent.

It's the old patterns, man, like,

no matter how low I've sunk,

I'm just not gonna borrow money.

I'm a big boy.

Yeah, I've noticed that.

And I'm not looking for a daddy.

Screw you, I am not that old.

I'm gonna be okay, Gil.

And so are we.

Hey.

(calm, soothing piano music)

You clearly don't know how
to deal with this, do you?

With what?

With this, with this
crummy apartment, with me,

with your whole fuckin' phony spiritual

new-age millennium bullshit.

You know you spin records for a bunch of

drugged out circuit queens,

you might as well be
dancin' to a train wreck!

You know what, you're one of them,

but you're afraid to admit it.

No, I'm not.

(water bubbling)

I'm a filmmaker.

No, you're one of them.

You know what's sad, is
you're getting old, Tad.

You hide behind your camera because

you're afraid to face people.

[Tad] Fuck you.

Why are you even making this movie?

I'm watching guys die out there.

We're killin' ourselves.

That's why I'm doin' it.

(horn honking)

Come here!

Louise?

[Louise] Hi, honey, listen, I was

out running some errands today, and I um,

wanna give you this.

[Tad] What is it?

Use it for your little
documentary, okay?

I gotta go, I got a lot more to do, but,

do me a favor, would you
keep this between us?

Okay.

â™« Hallelujah, hallelujah â™«


[Geno] A car is picking
you up in 10 minutes.

You have a suite at the hotel.

Security's ours, but you have
to be very, very discreet.

[Hector] I'm always discreet, baby.

[Geno] About that other
matter, the Bobby thing?

Can you take care of that,
make the arrangements?

[Hector] The arrangements are made.

[Geno] Okay.

Now this, you gotta be very,
very careful with this.

This is for Bobby only.

[Hector] I bet this
could kill somebody, right?

And what do you have for me?

[Geno] A post-dated wire transfer order

and an airline ticket.

Discretion is of the utmost importance.

(fun, upbeat music)

Would you miss me if I left you?

Where do you think you're goin'?

Nowhere, I was just wondering.

Did a lot of thinkin' about my life

when we had our little problem.

We worked it out.

[Hector] Yeah, we did.

I think this is my last Circuit party.

Good.

You should concentrate
on your photography, man.

You're very talented, Hector.

I really fucked things
up between us, didn't I?

No.

Have you heard Manny's new track?

I love you, John.

(upbeat music)

Well, I'm an ER nurse and uh,

you know I deal with tragedy all day long.

So, I like to come here,
kick back, relax and,

you know, be in an environment
where I'm not judged.

And uh, you know, the Circuit
works for me. (laughing)

Well like the drugs,
they make me feel horny.

But they gimme a lot of energy.

But frankly, they inhibit my
sexual, like, performance.

Well, thank God for the drugs. (laughing)

I mean, drugs promote safe sex.

(fun, upbeat music)

[Man In Gray Shirt] Baby, what's up?

[Hector] Alright, sweet babies,

who wants to place an order?


(phone dialing)

[Gil] Hello?

What am I doing here?

[Gil] What am I doin' here?

[John] You're making good
sense, it's mobbed here.

Anybody better-lookin' than me?

Uh, yeah, pretty much everybody.

[Gil] Oh, good, well I know you

could never make up your mind.

What would you say if
I asked you to join me?

Well having nothing to do
with what I really wanna do,

I think we should stick
to the original plan.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

I'll be home if you wanna talk.

[John] I'll be in the
bar with about 6,000

gorgeous, horny men if
you need to talk, okay?


(phone ringing)

Hello?

Is it hard yet?

[Bobby] Hector.

So why don't you come over and uh,

warm me up before my show?

I'll come over afterwards
to cool you down.

We'll have more time then.

Okay, my little prick tease.

I'll see you then.

(upbeat, drumming dance music)

[Person In Line] Hi.

Hey, nice to see you.

Nice to see you, too.

You have fun, now.

[Man In Line] Hey.

Thank you, have a good time.

Thanks.

(upbeat, drumming dance music)

Definitely, yeah, uh, uh uh.

(strobing dance music)

[Stage Manager] Okay, folks, we've got

two minutes for the show to start.

[Bobby] I'm not ready yet.

[Stage Manager] Okay,
the show is starting

in a minute and 30 seconds,

I'm gonna have the DJ cue the music.

Um, yeah, can you hear me out there?

Dj, cue the song and, on my, there we go

just cue it now, just cue it now,

he'll be out in a minute.

Bobby, what's the matter, man,

can you use the needle?

Can't handle that shit anymore.

[Stage Manager] Are you ready
back there in the bathroom?

I need more time.

[Stage Manager] Okay,
thanks Bobby, okay,

we're gonna go in one minute.

Everybody okay, everybody
got everything you need?

Everybody get their makeup on.

Okay, gettin' ready, okay
Bobby, how's it coming?

Are you ready to go?

Dancers, no no, put that down,

that does not go out on
stage, it stays here.

[Bobby] Hey, Tad, I need your help.

Yeah--

Woo-hoo!

[Stage Manager] Okay,
I'm opening the door.

Five, four, three,
everybody let's go let's go!

Come on, high energy, get
it up, get it up, get it up!

Let's go, everybody outside,
everybody out out out out.

(strobing dance music)

Okay, here we go.

Let's go, let's go, go go go
go the show's about to start.

(fast, building dance music)

â™« You don't seem to understand

â™« That I don't want another man

â™« And we gotta work this thing out

â™« So you know what I'm about

â™« You don't seem to understand

[Announcer] Your attention
to the South Stage, please.

The White Party proudly welcomes

the King of the Circuit
in his final performance.

Bobby Rocks.

(fast, upbeat dance music)

(calming piano music)

[Louise] We're nearly sold out,

there's even more people than last year.

[Geno] Jesus, you dumb fuck.

Come on, help me pick this up.

[Louise] You pick it up.

And I know about Bobby, too.

What do you know about Bobby?

I know you bet on his
life like a fast horse.

And you lost.

I helped Bobby out of a jam.

A hundred other insurance companies

would have done the same thing!

And there were others, too!

You don't know shit about Bobby!

Oh yes I do, he told me everything.

I hate you, I'm leaving you, Geno.

You're leaving me?

[Louise] I'm leaving you.

If you touch me, I swear I'll kill you.

(fast-paced dance music)

(deep breathing)

[Bobby] It's tribal, it's fraternal,

it's like the gay man's Superbowl.

They're like my family.

What a rush.

[Tad] Alright.

So that's it for you, Bobby, man.

The rest happens in the editing room.

Well, all I've done
is talk about myself.

I didn't ask anything about you.

What about you, Tad, you Circuit boy too?

No, I'm not.

I'm a filmmaker.

You know, I'm recording them.

Okay, I love it out there.

You know, you're out
there with your friends,

I mean even the guys
who aren't your friends

are all of a sudden your friends.

It's like flying, you know?

Yeah.

So yeah.

Yeah, I guess I'm a Circuit boy.

You know what man, there's
nothin' wrong with that.

Damn right, there's
nothin' wrong with that.

Fuck all those judgmental bastards, man.


(fast-paced, upbeat music)


Worth the wait?

You bet.

Come on in.

A few surprises.

You wanna party first?

[Bobby] Yeah.

Start with the K.

Come here, big boy.

(building drumming music)

(upbeat dance music)

[John] Hey, have you seen Hector?

He okay?

Just saw him a minute
ago, out back by the pool

He's fine, relax, go have some fun.

It isn't a good party without an OD.

What the fuck, it looks like a God damn

GHP epidemic out here.

John!

He says it's some sort of an emergency.

Hello?

[Gil] I love you!

(intense throbbing music)

That's for later.

[Paramedic] I'm gonna get Geno,

he's got a serious problem.

[Officer] Alright I want everybody

out of this filth right now!

[Geno] No way you're not,

talking to this bozo right
here, he's gonna shut us down.

(ambulance sirens)

(intense dance music)

I have a deal with the city,
you can't shut me down.

[officer] I want everybody

and all your pretty-boys outta here!

You can't shut me
down, you mother-fucker!

Stop the music!

The party, I feel the party.

It's beatin'. (laughing)

That's one for each of us, baby.

So what are we celebrating?

It's my birthday today.

Surprise!

Yeah?

How old?

I just turned 30.

So beautiful.

You saved my life tonight.

More than you'll ever know.

(intense dance music)

The party's over.

Hector, wake up.

Hector, wake up.

Oh, fuck.

Hector, can you hear me?

[Woman] Dios mio, Dios, mio!

(speaking Spanish)

[Man In Black] Overdose.

I'm so sorry, Bobby and
I were such good friends,

I don't know what...

He was, we were--

I just assumed that uh...

(train whistle blowing)

(pulsing drum music)


Hey doll. (laughing)

[Tad] How are you, wow,
glad you guys could be here.

This may be tough.

I love you.

[Nina] Hey.

Go ahead.

[Julian] Circuit save my life.

I mean, a regular person
wouldn't understand that.

But, the music and the
people really keeps me goin'.

It's validating, it's sexy, it's hot.

Get anybody I want.

Well, I'm out of it now, but uh,

I really liked the way it
made me feel, you know?

It was, it was very seductive.

(slow piano music)

â™« You saw me standing alone in the dark

â™« Lost in the silence of my heart

â™« Crying for angels, crying for light

â™« Crying for someone tonight

â™« No time for wasting, no time for truth

â™« No time for innocent lies

â™« Touched me like heroes
straight from your eyes â™«

Sometimes I feel like

I feel like there's
nothin' goin' on inside.

I hate that.

I hate that feeling.

[John] Haven't you ever loved someone

that no one else could understand?

(audience applauding)

â™« Passion burnin' out from under my skin

â™« Take me for a ride

â™« Until the night turns over

â™« Daylight steals the magic of the dark

â™« I need secrets in the dawn

â™« Love in the shadows â™«

(fast-paced dance music)

â™« Another secret in my life

â™« Another day I have to fight

â™« What shall I ask myself this time

â™« Are you the one to break these chains

â™« 'Cause I don't ever wanna hurt again

â™« Give me the time to just believe

â™« How many loves do I begin

â™« How many times before I win

â™« How many chances do I have to take

â™« When will I learn from my mistakes

â™« Is there a love to set me free

â™« How many love's it gonna take for me

â™« To break the spell, to make the change

â™« How many love's

â™« Seems like a lifetime passed me by

â™« And I don't need another reason why

â™« Why I should compromise myself no

â™« So why don't you say there's no one else

â™« It's only truth that
I would hear you tell

â™« Don't break my heart, don't make believe

â™« How many love's do I begin

â™« How many times before I win

â™« How many chances do I have to take

â™« When will I learn from my mistake

â™« Is there a love to set me free

â™« How many love's it gonna take for me

â™« To break the spell, to make the change

â™« How many love's it gonna take for me

â™« How many love's

â™« How many love's do I begin

â™« How many times before I win

â™« How many chances do I have to take

â™« When will I learn from my mistakes

â™« Is there a love to set me free

â™« How many love's it gonna take for me

â™« To break the spell, to break the chains

â™« How many loves

â™« How many, many loves

â™« Time to just believe

â™« How many loves â™«

â™« I take the wings in the mornin'

â™« Over the sea and fly

â™« Waterfalls, still preserve me

â™« The sky sends out a sound, a voice

â™« I hear

â™« Drivin' in my car, and
I'm thinkin' about it

â™« Places

â™« Footsteps

â™« Slide down and down I go

â™« And I hope the hills oh

â™« Wouldn't you wait for me

â™« Would you wait, would you wait

â™« Wouldn't you wait for me

â™« Time after time, I'm thinkin' about it

â™« I'm thinkin' thinkin' thinkin' thinkin'

â™« Doorways, darkness falls

â™« Dancin' shadow shapes and colors

â™« Ride on the wings of time

â™« And moments they turn

â™« You feel the air of your lungs â™«
