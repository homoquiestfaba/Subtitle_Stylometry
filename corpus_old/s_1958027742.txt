<i>Welcome to Boston for
the 2017 afc championship game</i>

<i>between the new england patriots
and the Pittsburgh steelers.</i>

<i>New england wins the toss</i>

<i>here at gillette stadium
in foxborough, Massachusetts.</i>

Game'â€™s about to start!

<i>These two teams
fighting for the right
to play down in Houston.</i>

Hey, game'â€™s about to start.
Everyone to your spots.

I got my tea.
Somebody get the guacamole.

We didn'â€™t make guacamole.
Chips with no guac!

I can'â€™t believe
we have to do this.
It'â€™s our tradition.

Trish, you'â€™re in
the dining room.
Get the magazine.

You were reading the magazine.

I can'â€™t see from in here!

There you go.
Yeah. Oh, thanks.

I'â€™m going to my chair.
Betty!

What?
I'â€™m standing next to it.

Just get on the ladder.

Get up on the ladder!
All right! Here I am.

Ladder!

I'â€™m on the ladder.

I think it'â€™s a fun tradition.

Yeah, 'â€™cause you'â€™re sitting
on the couch, drinking tea.

Yeah, sipping.
Drinking is vulgar.
I sip.

Lou, I have to tell you,

this really doesn'â€™t affect
the outcome of the game.

It'â€™s just a silly superstition.

Well, what happened
in week eight?

Well, I was standing
on the ladder
fixing a lightbulb

that was flickering
and driving me crazy.

Exactly. You were up
on the ladder at kickoff.

Trish was in the dining room
reading her magazine,

maura was drinking tea... sipping.

And I spilled the chips.
And what happened?

We beat the bills.


We killed the bills.

Why chance it?[Trish]
she'â€™s got a point.

Oh! There'â€™s Tom.

[Women gasp][Lou] oh,
what a beautiful man.


He'â€™s so well-hydrated.

[Speaking Spanish]

I prefer gronkowski these days.

We know, Trish.
We'â€™ve all read
your gronk erotica.

It'â€™s not erotica.

It'â€™s fan fiction.

Very sexy fan fiction.

No kidding.

[Cup clatters]
Oh, my god!

Oh! Get her a new tea!

I was distracted.
Trish, get her a new tea!

Sorry, guys!
It'â€™s almost kickoff!

It'â€™s not hot!
Just use the faucet!

I-I prefer it hot. Okay?

Maura, i'â€™ve got your tea.
Lou! The chips!

Oh, shit, the chips!
Kickoff in two, one...

<i>It'â€™s kickoff!</i>

[Crowd on TV cheer]

[Women cheering]

Well... oh, nice work!


["Get down on it" playing]

Tom Brady comes out.</i>

<i>Once again,
33rd postseason appearance.</i>

<i>The hold by Ryan Allen.</i>

<i>Cardona snaps it back.
The kick is good.</i>

All right! Okay!
Brady completes.

All right. Okay.
We'â€™re on the board.
That'â€™s good.

Third and long!
This is our song!

Third and long!
This is our song!

Yes![whoops]

<i>â™ª We'â€™ve got it all
in store for you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª from the berkshires
to the shore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª mayflower auto mart and more â™ª</i>

Oh, man!

She'â€™s new. She is pretty.

Oh, she'â€™s just
a knockoff of you.

You'â€™re the original
mayflower girl.

You'â€™re just as beautiful now
as you were back then.

Oh, god. Thank you.
Yes.

You know what it cost me
to look like this?

A fortune.

["Get down on it" continues]

Give 'â€™em the curse.
Okay.


<i>Third and goal.
Breath!</i>

<i>A hike to the 19...</i>


Okay, a toast.

To the man who brought us
all here: Tom Brady.

Who never gives up,
no matter what he'â€™s up against.

May the hand of fate
continue to bless him
with perfect spirals

and the confidence
to stand tall in the pocket.

To Tom.
To Tom!

To Tom.
To Tom.

To Tom!
And to our quarterback,

the woman
who brought us together

and made this our tradition.

No, I didn'â€™t plan on all this.

This is it.

Five, four, three, two, one,

Tom Brady!


We'â€™re going
to the super bowl!
Good job.

We did it![Sighs] oh, boy.

[Lou, Betty sigh]
So, I suppose

that gives us two weeks
to plan the super bowl party.

Shall we all
bring appetizers?
Why not?

Can I bring Carl?

You know,
things are getting serious.

again?[Betty] the handsome one.


What if we went?

Oh, Trish,
you fall in love faster
than any other human on earth.

Well, we can'â€™t all be
with the same man
for 50 years, Betty.


Let'â€™s all go to the super bowl.

Oh, no, Lou,
we'â€™ve looked into this.

We... we can'â€™t afford it.

No, the tickets, the hotels,
it'â€™s too expensive.

Two years ago,
I could'â€™ve paid
for us all to go.

But I divorced Ralph two weeks
before the playoffs.[Betty] oh, geez.

Boy, do I regret that.

The divorce?
No, he was terrible.

But the game was amazing.[Sobs]


Maura!

Oh, maura.

Oh, i'â€™m sorry.
I'â€™m sorry.

It'â€™s just that every time
I hear that word "divorce,"

I just think of Francisco.
You know?

Oh, maura. No, no.

Your husband
didn'â€™t divorce you.

He died.[Sniffles]

It'â€™s the same thing.

I'â€™m serious.
Let'â€™s go to the super bowl.

The super bowl is no place
for four old women.

This could be Tom'â€™s last one.

He'â€™s almost 40.

That'â€™s like 80 in people years.

Yeah, we'â€™re 80
in people years.
Exactly!

If Tom Brady can make it
to the super bowl,

so can we.

I'â€™d like to clarify,
i'â€™m not in my 80s.

Neither am I.

<i>On this momentous occasion.</i>

<i>We are gonna do
something insane
for our pats nation.</i>

Oh, it'â€™s nat and pat.
I love those guys.[Pat] <i>that'â€™s right.</i>

<i>We'â€™re gonna have
a super bowl ticket giveaway. Aw, baby!</i>

<i>Our four lucky fans
will get to travel
down to Houston</i>

<i>to see the pats
take on the falcons.</i>

the hotline, leave us a message.</i>

<i>Tell us your story.</i>

<i>Explain to us why
you deserve those tickets</i>

<i>better than anybody else. Yeah.</i>

<i>And we'â€™re gonna announce
the winner</i>

<i>to our listeners
at the super bowl.</i>

That'â€™s how we go!
It'â€™s a numbers game.

<i>This is not a numbers game.</i>

<i>So Don'â€™t leave us
a thousand messages.</i>

<i>We Don'â€™t want 'â€™em. Please!</i>

<i>We just wanna hear your story.</i>

<i>And who knows?</i>

<i>Maybe we'â€™ll see you
in Houston! Houston!</i>

See? He said
the best story wins.

We'â€™ve got a great story.

We'â€™re the biggest
pats fans there are.

We love Tom Brady.

And we'â€™re all
over 80 years old!

I'â€™m 75.

So, let'â€™s experience
a super bowl.

Because this might be
our last chance.

God, that'â€™s morbid.
Well, we gotta work
with what we got.

We'â€™re gonna do this.
Bring it in.

Yeah. Yeah.
Bring it, bring it.

Yes. Oh, yes.
Yeah, i'â€™m in.

Super bowl on three.

One, two, three.
Super bowl! [Laughs]

Hello, my name is Betty...
Elizabeth bachman.

Look, I crunched the numbers
and based on your viewership,

my friends and I have
about a .00013% chance here.

So, I realize that
the probability

of me winning this contest is very,
very low...[Betty'â€™s husband] Honey!

But I used to be a professor
of applied mathematics at mit,

back when there were
only two other women
in the whole department,

so i'â€™m used to
the odds being against me.

Honey?
I have to run to class.

Have you seen my watch?

It'â€™s on the mantel
over the fireplace.

You'â€™re also gonna need pants.

Pants? Oh.

Right.
What would I do without you?

I just really need this trip.

Thank you very much.

Oh. What do you think
of my... my paper?

I'â€™m gonna submit it
to the journal.

Look, I love
your principal points, I do,

but the whole paper right now
is rather confusing.

And you can'â€™t expect
people to understand

unless you weave
the concepts together
a bit better and...

Pants.

Yep, pants. Right.

Hi. My name is maura,

and my friends and I
are die-hard pats fans.

Which wasn'â€™t always the case
growing up in Oregon,

where my mother
was a lumberjack... that'â€™s great,

but if we want
the advantage here,

it has to sound like
a real story.

So let'â€™s keep it believable.
Right?

All right. Sure, maura.
Okay.

But she really was a lumberjack.

elementary school was hard.

And then when
middle school came,
things got much worse.

Much, much worse.

And my mom started
picking on me too... uh... uh...

Don'â€™t make it so sad.

It'â€™s about the best story wins,
not the saddest story.

Okay?

Thank you.

[Resident 2] Hello?

Yes.
Uh, my name is maura,

and my three friends
and I are dying.
Thank you.

Okay. Bye-bye.

We'â€™re... we'â€™re dying
to go to the super bowl.

Oh, right.
Yeah.

Oopsie.
Mmm.

Yeah.

Hey, maura.

Thank you for including me
in all of this.

This is a lot of fun.

Oh, good. [Chuckles]

Hey, do you think
you could round up
some more residents?

Because some of
these performances
aren'â€™t helping our odds.

You got it.

Thanks, Mick.

<i>I mean, this guy
is like Caesar. No, he'â€™s perfect.</i>

<i>And he'â€™s like genghis Khan.</i>

are die-hard"... no, no.

"My best friends and I
are die-hard pats fans.

We'â€™re all ladies over 80
who love Tom Brady.

Twenty years ago,
we didn'â€™t know anything"...

No, no, no.

"It was 16 years ago.

<i>I'â€™d just finished
my last round of chemo,</i>

<i>and my three best friends
had come over to cheer me up."</i>

How about some TV?

Mmm.


<i>So third down and ten now.</i>

<i>Big play for the patriots.</i> I
can'â€™t change the channels.

Oh, I can do it.

[Announcer continues]

Yeah, it'â€™s not working.

Remote'â€™s been acting funny.

I got it.

<i>Shaun Ellis, 92...</i>

[Volume increases]
<i>Was carrying...</i> Oh!

What do I do?

Don'â€™t hit it.
I already hit it.

Unplug it.

Hold on.

<i>Two minutes left in this game.</i>

<i>Drew bledsoe is out.</i>

<i>They'â€™re gonna have to go
with their backup qb.</i>

<i>Tom Brady, the second-year
quarterback from
the university of Michigan.</i>

Who'â€™s that?

<i>I think anybody could tell
by looking at bledsoe...</i>

He is cute.

Oh, i'â€™ll watch this.

I can turn myself down.

[Announcer continues]

maybe it was destiny,</i>

<i>but at that moment,</i>

<i>the patriots'â€™
backup quarterback
got called off the bench."</i>

that has to be so difficult.</i>

<i>Oh, my god.</i>

got the remote working,</i>

<i>and one week of football
became two."</i>

You know, for a game
where a bunch of guys
just smash into each other,

it'â€™s really very complicated.

There are so many patterns,

and if you analyze the data,
you will find...

We'â€™re just starting
to enjoy it, Betty.

Don'â€™t make it about math.

Oh. Okay.

became a season."</i>

[All exclaiming]

<i>"Tom and the patriots
went on to win
the super bowl that year.</i>

<i>And I, well, i'â€™m still here,
thanks to my team."</i>

And to Lou,
our quarterback.[Screams]

You didn'â€™t!

we had a new tradition.</i>

<i>That'â€™s why
it would mean the world to us
to win these tickets."</i>

<i>What are we talking about?</i>

Look, i'â€™m glad you asked.</i>

<i>Tonight is the end
of our ticket giveaway,</i>

<i>and we have received
a record number of submissions.</i>

<i>But, hey, look, you still got
as about a good a chance</i>

<i>as being the 199th draft pick</i>

<i>and going on to become</i>

<i>the four-time, soon to be
five-time, super bowl champ.</i>

<i>We need one for the thumb here.</i>

and buy your tickets online,</i>

<i>but for four tickets,
you'â€™d have to sell your car.</i>

<i>Well, not your car. Yeah.</i>

<i>My car'â€™s garbage.</i> My... [groans]

<i>In your case...</i>

"My best friends and I
are die-hard pa"... [groans]

This isn'â€™t gonna work.

Oh, what do I do, Tom?


What do I do?


<i>Carmax of andover,
how can I help you?</i>

Lou, what'â€™s going on?

You'â€™re acting very strange, Lou.


Lou, i'â€™ve got to
get home before dinner.

It'â€™s craps night.

You'â€™ve got
your own house, maura.

Why are you still living
in a retirement center?

Frank loved it very much.

Okay, look.

Oh! I love presents.
I love presents.

Whoo!
Oh!

Oh, my gosh.
What is happening?

I wanted it to be a surprise,

but all they had
were gender reveal boxes.

Who'â€™s having a baby?

No one.

It'â€™s not a gender reveal.
It'â€™s just a reveal.

Of what?


We won the tickets.
We'â€™re going to the super bowl.

Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
These are tickets.

How did that happen?
How did that happen?

Teamwork. I just did
what Tommy would do.

Who cares how it happened?
We'â€™re going to the super bowl!

Oh, my god![Betty] oh, my god!

[All exclaiming]

<i>Welcome back to</i> pats nation.

<i>The super bowl
is only three days away,</i>

<i>and I am more excited
about this than my own wedding.</i>

<i>I'â€™m much more excited about it
than I was about your wedding.</i>

I did not agree that
we could see other people.

That'â€™s not dating.

That'â€™s cheating,
and i'â€™m done talking about it.

I do not want to talk to you.

in anything you have to say.

Wow, this chapter
is really good.

Oh, it'â€™s so steamy.

No, it'â€™s not finished.

No. Not you, Carl.

With you, it is finished.

Oh, Lou, I need a hug.


Oh, baby.

You'â€™re too good
for that one anyway.

Oh, god. I'â€™m just...


Betty'â€™s right. I-I'â€™m...

I have to stop falling in love.

No. You can fall in love.

Just maybe wait till
you'â€™ve known them
more than a week.

Maybe I just stay home.

And mope around? No.

We'â€™re going to the super bowl

to enjoy men
the way the romans did:

Sweaty,
piled on top of one another.

Tight pants.


for your blood pressure.
It says take twice a day.

And this one'â€™s for you
to go to sleep,

so it'â€™s very important
you only take it
before bed, all right?

I... i'â€™m sorry. What?

This one is for
your blood pressure.

Twice a day, okay?

And this one
is to help you sleep.

It'â€™s important
to take sleep seriously.

But only take it
when you'â€™re ready for bed,
okay? Because... [exhales]

All right, let me know
if you need anything else.

Oh, before you leave,
have you finished
making the corrections?

Honey, you really need
to take another pass at it.

I mean, you need to
add your own voice.

Well, you know my voice
better than I do.

No, no, no. I Don'â€™t.
I never did.

Listen to me.
Okay.

You can do it.

Okay. I think so.

Okay.

Mind if I come in?

I see your bags are packed.

So where you headed?

Super bowl.

Super bowl. Really?
Yeah.

No, you'â€™re kidding?
Mm-mmm.

Oh, man.

You know,
I used to play football.

High school. Yeah.
Mmm?

I was a wingback.

A little undersized,

but the coach always said
I had great feet.

My husband always said
that I had great feet.

Mmm.
But he just
really liked feet.


I heard that he passed away.

Was it last year?

Yeah.
Oh.

Yeah.

My wife, uh,
she passed away too.

Oh, i'â€™m so sorry.

I'â€™m so sorry.
You know,
these things happen.

Hey.

If you need someone
to accompany you
to the super bowl...

Thank you so much,

but i'â€™m already
going with friends. Thank you.

But, hey, there is a lot
going on in this place

that you should explore.
Mm-hmm. Yep.

There'â€™s... no, really.

There'â€™s pool aerobics.
There'â€™s, um...

There'â€™s dancing.

There'â€™s game night.
Yeah.

Uh, lunch.
Yeah.

Lately, i'â€™ve...

Been realizing that
it'â€™s less about what you do,

more about
who you do it with, you know?

I look around this place, and...

You'â€™re the only one
I really wanna be around,
you know?

It seems like you got it
all figured out and...


Talking to myself.

[Horn honking]

Stop honking.
Betty hates it.

She thinks it'â€™s bad manners.

I know.
That'â€™s why I do it.


you didn'â€™t have to
honk so many times.

One toot is enough.

Uh... [sighs]

This trunk is full.

Lou, why didn'â€™t
we take your SUV?

It'â€™s in the shop.

Don'â€™t worry, Betty.

This thing has plenty of room.

It'â€™s a 'â€™93.
It is? It'â€™s...

They Don'â€™t make them
like this anymore.

They Don'â€™t make this model
like they used to.
Oh, boy.

<i>We are a mere two days away
from the super bowl.</i>

Houston better get ready.</i>

<i>I think
they'â€™re gonna run out of beer.</i>


Tight brakes.

What you want me to do?
Not stop?

She'â€™s not answering.
I'â€™ve called about ten times.

Here, i'â€™ll get her.

It'â€™s the truth.
Pacing will not help.

Well, it can'â€™t hurt.

Afternoon, bill.

Here he is. Here he is.

Hey, ladies.
Yes. Hello.

I'â€™m sorry.
I went and checked,

but maura'â€™s sleeping.

Please wake her up.

Please just wake her up.

We Don'â€™t just
wake anyone up here.

It'â€™s a very strict policy.

It'â€™s part of
our core philosophy.

We take sleep seriously.

See?

Oh! Uh...

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Mmm. Mm-mmm.[Lou] oh, damn it.

Maura! Maura!
Oh, oh. Ladies. Seriously.

Shh! Please, please.
Maura!

Okay. Okay, we'â€™re going.
Thank you.

We just had a moment.
Thank you.

You guys are very fast.
That'â€™s a good sign.

Where'â€™s maura?

She'â€™s sleeping,

and the manager won'â€™t let us in
to wake her up.

What do we do?
We'â€™re gonna miss our flight.

I got it. I came prepared.

There'â€™s no way
we'â€™re gonna make it. Where...


Are all your suitcases
just wigs?

Let'â€™s go.

So you still get
the cute little face,

but you Don'â€™t get
all the breathing problems.

Oh, that is fascinating.

Do you have any photos?

Oh, yeah. Sure.

All I have is pug photos.

Look at this guy.[Gasps] oh, look at that.

That'â€™s toffee... uh-huh.

And that'â€™s Bobby
right there.
Let me show you.

Can I take you on a tour?

[Chef talking]

Wow.
They have a cooking class.
Wow. Look at that chef.

Maura was right.
It'â€™s emeril in there.

They have
absolutely everything here.

She'â€™s been wanting me to take
a pottery class with her,

but honestly, I can'â€™t
see myself throwing a pot.

<i>I hope that you feel
like you used your time
with him wisely,</i>

<i>because you lied
to him.</i> Excuse me.

Does anyone know
where maura Martinez is?


Wait for the commercial.

She'â€™s in her room.


Here, i'â€™ll take you.



[Betty whispering]
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

[Lou] Sorry.
Yeah.

I think she'â€™s sleeping.</i>

Well, thanks, um... Mickey.

Look, Mickey,

our flight is leaving
in three hours and 23 minutes.

I'â€™ll, uh...
Okay, well, i'â€™ll be here.

I'â€™ll be right out here.
Maura?

standing guard out here.
Maura? Oh!

Maura? Maura?

Honey, I can do this.
Ma... okay. All right.

Maura. [Shouting] Maura!

She'â€™s got a pulse.

I can'â€™t read that.
Sleeping pills.

Oh. Get a wheelchair.

Get a wheelchair.
Mickey?

Oh, Mickey, good.
Yeah?

Could you possibly
get us a wheelchair?

A wheelchair?
Yeah.

You'â€™re breaking her out,
aren'â€™t you?

Well, no, we'â€™re actually...
We'â€™re going...

No, you'â€™re breaking her out.
Okay. Yeah.

Well, it figures
that she'â€™d have
really cool friends.

He'â€™s getting one.

Take these with us.
They belong to her.

This cash too.
Well, that...

I'â€™ll give it to her
in the car.
All right.

You'â€™ll witness it.
You'â€™ll see it.
Okay. I'â€™m witnessing.

[Lou] Is it clear?
Yeah, it'â€™s clear.

Let'â€™s go. Let'â€™s go.
Okay.

All clear.
Out of the way.
Out of the way.

Go ahead. Go ahead.
Watch your feet.

This way, to the left.

To the left. Go, go, go.
Here we go. Here we go.

our deluxe garden suite,

but you know
our resort is 60 and over,

so you might have to wait
a few more years to qualify.
Oh. [Chuckles]

Hey!

Go!
Where are you going?

Stop right there.
Tony, wait.

Do you even care about my dogs?

No, I Don'â€™t.


she'â€™s still sleeping.
Come back. Wait.

[On pa] Ladies and gentlemen,
pat sajak from <i>wheel of fortune</i>
is in the house.

Pat sajak is here,
and he'â€™s signing autographs
right now.

Pat sajak.
Hey, cecile.
What'â€™s going on?

Where is the party at, huh?

Oh, what'â€™s going on? Hey.[Mickey]
there'â€™s vanna here too.

Thank you so much.


Come on!



Whoo![screams]

Wh-what are we celebrating?


We'â€™re going to the super bowl!

the super bowl!
What? Oh!

[Whooping continues]

the super bowl.</i>


Let'â€™s go to a bar.
I love bars.
No kidding.

We'â€™re not going to a bar
so you can talk to men.

Lou, I told you
I am not gonna flirt.

I know this is a girls trip.

Well, maybe i'â€™ll flirt.

I Don'â€™t think
i'â€™ve ever flirted
in my whole life.

[Trish] You can do it.
Okay. Okay.

Hrishi?

You have a nice head.

Why, thank you.

We'â€™ll work on it.
Okay.

Yeah.

[Elevator dings][Lou] oh, erhan suites.

Is this great or what?

And it'â€™s all super bowl themed.

Yeah, but they only
gave us one room.

And there'â€™s no more rooms
in the whole hotel.

There'â€™s no more rooms
in the whole city.

At least this one has two beds.

Be appreciative.

Oh, look. There'â€™s Tom.

Oh, he'â€™s much bigger
in real life.

That'â€™s just a cardboard him.

The real him is
at least twice that size.

Oh, Tom.

Make that pass. Make it.

I'â€™m taking this one.
He'â€™s cute.

Maura! Who did you pick?

[Phone ringing]


Hi. Hi.
Mmm?

<i>Hey, mom?</i>

Um, hey, I just got a call
from the hospital

saying they'â€™re trying
to reach you
and you'â€™re not answering.

<i>They called me
as your emergency contact.
Is everything okay?</i>

Yes, i'â€™m fine.
Everything'â€™s fine.

I... I just had some tests done.

They'â€™re calling...

To go over them.

Why are you whispering?


and the other girls
are sleeping.

<i>W-where are you?</i>

Uh, New Hampshire.

We took a little trip
to a bed-and-breakfast.

<i>Oh, that sounds nice.</i>

Um, mom,
call your doctor back. <i>Okay.</i>

Night, sweetie.

All right, love you. Night.

Love you.

I can'â€™t sleep.

Me neither. [Chuckles]

I miss frank.

I miss sleeping next to him.

Nighttime'â€™s the worst.

I just lay there, awake,
thinking of him.

I feel like
i'â€™m just living in the past,

and I can'â€™t move on.

Maura, you'â€™re not
living in the past.

You'â€™re right here with us.

And we'â€™re here for you.

I love you. [Chuckles]

Oh, I love you.

Here, section 138, row 30,
seats four, five, six and seven.

They'â€™re so shiny.

Can I hold them?

[Trish laughs] Oh![Lou] oh! Uh-oh!

Caught one.
We can'â€™t lose those.

You'â€™re right.
Those are gold.

Well, clearly, you shouldn'â€™t
be holding them, then.

How many reading glasses
have you gone through this year?

That doesn'â€™t count.

Reading glasses
are designed to be lost.

Okay, fine.

Who'â€™s the most responsible one?

Oh!

Me.

Okay.

Good thing
I brought my strap-on.


I Don'â€™t think
that'â€™s what it'â€™s called.

Sure it is. Look.

You just strap...

It on.
Wow.

That'â€™s a Fanny pack.

Not if you Don'â€™t wear it
around your Fanny.

If you wear it like this,
it'â€™s a strap-on.

And I will keep them safe.

Okay.

Before we head out,
let'â€™s look at the agenda.

First up, the NFL experience.

Wait a minute,
"agenda" sounds like work.

I love a good agenda.

Let'â€™s go to a spa.
No.

We didn'â€™t win these tickets
to go to a spa.

We came here for football.

We'â€™re going to have
the NFL experience.

[Crowd chattering]

we'â€™re actually here.

I can'â€™t believe it.

This place is huge.

Look at all the helmets.

Oh, oh! I wanna get one
for my grandkids.

than my wildest dreams.

Not mine.

This morning, I had a dream

I was going down
the Amazon river on a pickle

with my papier-mÃ¢chÃ© children.

There'â€™s so much here to do.

Yeah, well, you Don'â€™t need
a brochure to tell you that.

You know what?
I'â€™ve looked at this.

If we wanna hit all the booths,

we have to average
under five minutes
for each one

except, you know, the big...



[Tom Brady]
<i>Welcome to the qb countdown.</i>

<i>Let'â€™s see how many passes
you can complete in 45 seconds.</i>

I'â€™m good at this. Watch.

[Game referee] Next.
I know. I know.

Oh, I thought you was
waiting on your grandson.

Nope, i'â€™m here to play.

Well, good luck, Nana.

I Don'â€™t want you
to break anything.

Hey, you sound confident.

Would you like to
place a little wager on it?


Ten bucks says
she won'â€™t hit
more than five.

That'â€™s not a bet.

She wins, she gets
your falcons Jersey.

Deal.
Deal.

There you go. Okay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Blows whistle]

Technically,
we Don'â€™t allow betting here.

[Brady on pa] <i>Hey, Lou.</i>

But they Don'â€™t pay me that much,

so let'â€™s see
how this plays out.

how this plays out.

<i>I'â€™m up here.
I'â€™m talking to you.</i>

<i>Louella, Don'â€™t worry about
how hard you throw it.</i>

<i>It'â€™s all about
accuracy and touch.</i>

All right, now. You'â€™re up.

All right.[Game referee] all right.

Ready. Set. Throw.


[Crowd exclaiming]
Smoke 'â€™em! Smoke 'â€™em, Lou.

Oh!
Hey, when are you
gonna start throwing?

For Pete'â€™s sake.
Ma'â€™am, would you
mind your business?

I'â€™ve never seen anything
like this in my life.

Is there
a mute button for her?
Oh, oh, oh!

Really?
I am terrified.

Seriously, the eld... do you have
anything else to do with your life?

Oh, you'â€™re killing him.
You'â€™re killing him.

Ma'â€™am, you are
stressing me out, okay?

Oh, really?
Is it distracting?

I hope so.
You dropped your multivitamin.

Fancy footwork.
Look at that.

Man, that is something.

Whoo!

Oh, my... will you back up?

That'â€™s really unimpressive.
Oh, my goodness.

Amazing!
Ma'â€™am!

definitely been day drinking.

That'â€™s what her problem
is... three, two, one!

[Buzzer sounds][Crowd cheers]

You did it! I told you.
I knew i'â€™d make it.
I knew.

That was incredible.

Yeah, you, uh, you scored
over 20 points,

which means you get
a free super bowl Jersey.

I want the Brady.
I want the Brady.

What size are you?

I'â€™m not wearing that.

We can go double or nothing

if you want your Jersey back.

But if we win,
you gotta wear that.

Fine.

Trish, we'â€™re in Houston.
Can'â€™t we get some barbecue?

Oh, your book! Look.

[Trish gasps]

They have it.[Chuckles]

Look at... sign it.
My god.

Come on. Really?
Yes. I have a pen.
It'â€™s here somewhere.

You'â€™re bad.

All right.

Excuse me, what are you doing?

Oh, i'â€™m just
admiring these books.

Uh, you'â€™re gonna have to
pay for that.

She'â€™s signing it.

You'â€™re...
You'â€™re Virginia ledough?
Ledoux.

Oh, my gosh.

I sell so many copies
of your book.

And i'â€™m a personal fan.

You know what?
You guys just go ahead.

I'â€™m gonna find some barbecue.

I think it'â€™s outside.
I'â€™ll see you in a bit.

Are you working on anything new?

Actually, yeah.
I'â€™m working on
a holiday-themed book.

a merry Christmas.</i>

Can I preorder?

Yeah, absolutely.

Holidays are
a very sexual time for me.

Wow.

Uh, hello?

Excuse me.

Oh. Hi. Um...

I'â€™d like to get some wings.

Oh, i'â€™m sorry.
They'â€™re not for sale.

This is a spicy wings contest.

Really?
Yeah.

But I must warn you,
it gets really intense.

They got spices that sound like
they'â€™re from a horror film.

Like what?
California reaper...

Whoa... ghost pepper,
Teddy bears picnic.

Now, that one'â€™s the most scary

'â€™cause it sounds like
it'â€™s all warm and cuddly,

but it'â€™s not.
It'â€™s really not.
Oh.

Well, I could use
a little spice.

This ain'â€™t no little spice.

And this is his contest.

Guy fieri.

[Betty, chuckling] Oh.

I mean, look at him.

He even looks spicy.

I'â€™m in.

You sure?
Mm-hmm.

I'â€™m gonna need
your emergency contacts

in case something happens.
Well, that would be
my husband, Mark.

But Don'â€™t call him.
Don'â€™t call him.

knowing I was doing this.

If you black out,
you Don'â€™t want me
to call your husband?

No. Don'â€™t call him.
So who do
you want me to call?

An ambulance?


Yay!

Ladies and gentlemen!

Are you ready for
the spicy bbq
hot wings challenge?

[Crowd cheers]

The rules are simple.

If you Don'â€™t wanna
clear your seat,
you better handle the heat.

You touch the milk, you'â€™re gone.

Let'â€™s bring out
the pain train to flavortown.

In three, two, one.
Bring the pain.

[Crowd cheering]

Oh, my god.
That'â€™s Betty!
Oh, my god.

This is the train to pain.

Who can handle the heat?

Hold it together.

Hang in there.

Hang in there. Hang in there.

[Crowd exclaims]
Oh! You'â€™re gone.

Go. Go. Go.

Excuse me, Betty?

You Don'â€™t have to
eat it all.
It'â€™s okay. I'â€™m hungry.

I know her!

"And it was then,

on the hallowed turf
of gillette stadium,

that gronk took her,

and she knew

this was the best
a man could get."

Thank you.
Thank you so much.

This is all so unexpected.

Uh, if i'â€™m not mistaken,
Mrs. Ledoux,

you are a multi-hyphenate.

Aren'â€™t you
the original mayflower girl?

I love your book.

Thank you.[Chuckles]

Well, that was...
That was a long time ago.

Well, beauty has
no expiration date.

Dan o'â€™callahan.

Oh, my god. That ring.

Oh, my god. The fingernails.

Football nails.
You'â€™ve got two rings.
Yep.

I have to assume
you... you played.
I did.

Two super bowls.
Two different teams.

So, do I just call you
the mayflower girl?

Patricia.

[Fan] Love your book.
Thank you.

Saved our marriage.
Thanks.

Wait a minute, not Virginia?

Uh, Virginia ledoux
was the name of my poodle.

Well, your poodle
must have a real thing
for football players.

No.

I do.

Ladies and gentlemen,

here we are
at the pinnacle of pain,

the temple of heat.

Our final round,

dal versus Betty.

Dal, how you feeling, bud?

I'â€™m feeling great,
guy... all right. Great, dal.

And, Betty, everything okay?

Yeah, i'â€™m just getting ready.

All right.
Remember, embrace the spice.

Lean into this. Don'â€™t fight it.
It only makes it harder.

Okay.
You go big or you go home.

Okay.
All right.

All right.
For this final round,
Satan'â€™s tongue.

The most difficult wing we have.

And we'â€™re going
on three, two, one.

Bring the heat!

Dal gets a nice portion.
So does Betty.

Dal with one...
Dal with one bite.

Betty with two.

Dal?

Dal'â€™s not looking good.

Dal'â€™s shaking.
Betty has another bite.

Dal spits. Dal'â€™s out!

Give it up for our champ, Betty!

Oh, well...

your champ, Betty!

Betty, how'â€™d you pull that off?

That one had a...

A b... listen,

it was amazing to watch you
knock that out of the park.

How did you do this?

How do you handle
spice at this level?

I Don'â€™t know.

Unless it has extreme flavor,
I can'â€™t taste anything anymore.

Well, speaking of
extreme flavor,

I got some brisket
you gotta try.

Can I bring my friends?
Absolutely!
You'â€™re the champ!

Give it up for champ Betty!

Maura, would you like
some more brisket?

Oh, I could eat your brisket
all day long, you brute.

There you go. There you go.

Mmm! Mmm!

It'â€™s so good.

Ah!
Trish!

Oh, hi.
Trish!

Are you guy fieri?

Of course he is.
Where have you been?

I'â€™ve been talking to a fan,

and he invited us to a party.

Look.
A fan?

A fan of my writing.

Also a two-time
super bowl champion.

Trish.

I didn'â€™t flirt.
I mean, he did.

Don'â€™t you think
we should rest before
the big game tomorrow?

Wait. If it'â€™s that party,

oh, you go...
It'â€™s gonna be off the hook.

I'â€™m going to that party.

Yeah. I mean, he'â€™s right.
Look, we'â€™re not playing.

I thought the whole point
of this trip was having
an adventure together.

This is an adventure.

I'â€™m there.

Will there be dancing?

If you'â€™re going,
there'â€™ll be dancing.

Oh, gosh. Betty?
Yes?

Betty, Betty, Betty.
Let me just check your lips.

Oh.

You,
who never wear lipstick.
Uh-huh.

Okay, good.
Don'â€™t lick your lips.
All right.

Let me see your beauty Mark.

Very good.
Come on. Let'â€™s go.

Okay. Hot stuff.[Chuckles]

Are we gonna be
the oldest people here?

Don'â€™t reinforce stereotypes.

Oh, there'â€™s Dan. Dan!

You have a fan named Dan?

Yeah, Dan o'â€™callahan.

Hey, come on up!

I thought you said
you'â€™ve been working out.


How many leg days
have you skipped?

Look at those chicken legs.

That'â€™s mean.
He'â€™s got great legs.

Oh, it'â€™s called "negging."
It'â€™s how we flirt.

on negative things?
Can you let them up?

Oh, he'â€™s getting us
in.[Bouncer] sorry, ladies.

play for the pats.
Sorry.

It is so great to meet you all.

Dan.
You played for the pats?

I did. For three years.
Wow.

But I spent most of my time
with the raiders.

Hmm.

Okay.

You look lovely.

Thank you.

Well, hey, I wanna
introduce you to
some of my friends.

Come on inside.

Where'â€™s maura?
Where'â€™s maura?

Oh, oh, oh. Come on, maura.
We gotta stick together.

Christ'â€™s sake.
Have you lost your mind?
Excuse us.

Thank you so much.
Thank you.
It'â€™s too bad.

Bye. Thanks a lot.
You are gentlemen.

I really appreciate it.[Betty] come on.

[Smooth jazz playing]


Wow. I have never been
to a party like this.

The only parties we go to
are faculty parties

where they just
have cheap champagne.

Last party I went to
was a funeral.

It was fun.

I bet they'â€™ve got
tons of drugs here.

Piles of cocaine.

I bet they even have

one of those <i>eyes wide shut</i>
sex rooms somewhere,

Don'â€™t you think?

You know, i'â€™m gonna
head back to the hotel.

I... I need to relax.
Here.

Oh, thank you.

Who are you?

Oh, we met outside.
Yes, this is... Sophie.

Sophie. Oh, this is Sophie.
Yeah.

What a lovely name.

That'â€™s my granddaughter'â€™s name,
Sophie.
Mmm!

Just a wonderful name.

These are good.
Very good.

Well, careful.
They'â€™re high dosage.

What?
High dosage?

[Sophie] Yeah.
Are they drugs?

Yeah. You said
you wanted to relax.

Mmm.

What... Sophie!

Say, Sophie!

Lou, where are you going?

I ate two of 'â€™em. Two gummies.

if I had three?

Your friend drugged us.

Big deal. You used to
smoke pot all the time.

That was medicinal.

All right. Okay.
We did it. We took drugs.

But let'â€™s just,
you know, enjoy it.

I'â€™m going back to the hotel.

I need my ticket.

I'â€™ve gotta get some sleep

so i'â€™m fresh
for the game tomorrow,

which is why we'â€™re here.

Unless you two are so hungover
you can'â€™t join me.

Gimme the ticket.

Oh, god. Wait.

I left it at the hotel,
didn'â€™t I?

I took it off at the...

God, no, I didn'â€™t. I didn'â€™t.

I took it off at
the spicy wings contest.

I... I put it down on the...

You'â€™ve lost the tickets?

No, I was trying to pretend
it wasn'â€™t spicy,

and it was
really, really spicy, and I...

We'â€™ve got to
find those tickets.

We'â€™ve got to go to
the NFL experience now.

It'â€™s closed.
Look. Listen.

Now, just calm down.
Everybody calm down.

Guy said he was going to be
at this party tonight.

We just find guy.

I'â€™m sure he knows where
the strap-on thing is...

How do you expect to find
one guy in a sea of thousands?

Huh?

Huh?
There! There he is.
There he is.

Where? I Don'â€™t see him.
He went that way.

I Don'â€™t see him.
Why are you jogging?

I'â€™m jogging
because he'â€™s jogging.

Girls?

[Audio, music distorts]

[Maura, echoing] Guy?

[Music playing normally]


Where did maura go?

Well, I Don'â€™t know.
Where'â€™s guy?

I thought
we were looking for him.

[Guests chattering in distance]

[Maura gasps]

<i>Eyes wide shut.</i>

[Funky electronic music playing]

<i>â™ª Oh, why is nobody dancing?
Yeah â™ª</i>

getting down? â™ª</i> we lost him.

[Music continues playing][Betty]
Lou, look! Look!

Where? Where?

We gotta find those tickets.

Yes, but doesn'â€™t this music
make you want to dance?[Grunts]

No, we'â€™ve gotta stay focused.

Yes, but it'â€™s so...

So good.
Oh, yeah.

Excuse me.
I'â€™m looking for someone.

[Dealer'â€™s voice]
You here for the poker game?

[Marshawn lynch'â€™s voice]
You want some skittles?

[Player'â€™s voice]
Are you okay?

I think so.

[Player 2'â€™s voice]
Have a seat.

[Maura'â€™s voice]
I'â€™m guy fieri.

["Work it out" playing]

Oh! Oh, my god!

[Crowd exclaiming]

I'â€™m so sorry I hit you.[Grunts]

Let me see.
Mmm.

It'â€™s not bad. It'â€™s not bad.

You just...

It'â€™s just I like to dance.
I never get to dance.


That gummy bear was a humdinger.

Maybe you oughta slow down.

Yeah. Maybe you oughta
slow down too.

This is pretty slow.

At the hottest party
in Houston,
with the hottest people,

i'â€™m sitting here
with someone'â€™s grandma.

Chomping the gummy bears
or whatever.

I get it. Oh, I get it.

I get it.

It'â€™s the negative,
you know, the neg...

I can do this. I can do this.

Let me look at you.

No. My god.

You'â€™re, like, perfect.
Stand up.

Stand up.

Turn around. Turn around.

Oh. No. Turn, quick.

Okay.

Sit down.
There must be something.

Show me your teeth.
What?

Let me see your teeth.
Come on. Show me.

Oh, there it is.
What?

Look at that. Oh, my god.
What?

A snaggletooth.

Oh, god, you could
eat corn through a fence.

[Phone ringing]
Oh!

Yep, yep.

Yeah.

Hi, honey.

Well, hi back to you.

So, I wanted you to know,

I-I sent you two versions
of the paper, a and b,

and I want you to tell me
which one to go with. Okay?

<i>No, I-I can'â€™t.</i>

I'â€™m at a party
with a bunch of kids.

I'â€™m... i'â€™m 36. I'â€™m a
man.[Mark] <i>uh, what?</i>

You'â€™re working on it.

<i>I gotta go.</i> Uh...

Uh, o-okay.

[Player 2] Maura.

Yeah? Hmm?

Bet'â€™s to you, maura.

I'â€™ve been playing?

No, you'â€™ve been killing it.

Come on, gugu.

She'â€™s got
half the table on tilt.

Every time she raises,

she says she'â€™s gonna
take us to flavortown,

and then she...

She nicknamed me "brisket."

You know what?
I shouldn'â€™t be here.

I should leave
I Don'â€™t belong here.
No, no, no.

You gotta stay.

You got to.
Yes.

You are meant to be here.

Sometimes fate puts you
exactly where
you supposed to be.

It'â€™s your bet.

Oh! Yeah, okay.

Um...

How much is this?

Forty.[maura] okay.

I'â€™ll, uh... i'â€™ll raise you $40.

Oh, wow. Really?

[Clears throat, whispers]
It'â€™s 40,000.

Right.

Right.

Okay.

I'â€™ll raise you $40,000.

I'â€™m already out.

You are a shark,
aren'â€™t you, maura?

No, no.
My late husband loved gambling.

And he would lose
every single time.[Chuckles]

I would win all the time,

so I would slip
some of these chips
under his stack

so he could keep on playing.

sweet story, but...


Okay.

[Gugu gasps, exclaims]
Trip twos! Sorceress.


Dark sorcery.

Shut it, brisket.

Oh, shit.

[Jazz playing]
Any requests?


Try "I won'â€™t dance"
in the original key of c.

Ma'â€™am, we'â€™re not doing karaoke.

[Phone ringing][Sighs]

My phone.

Hello?

Mom, did you call the hospital?

No, not yet.

Mom, you need to call.
It'â€™s important.

<i>Where are you?</i>

Some Texas mansion.

<i>But you said
you were in New Hampshire.</i>

I'â€™m not. I'â€™m in Houston
for the super bowl.

<i>The super bowl?
How did you afford that?</i>

<i>It'â€™s fine.
Don'â€™t worry about it.</i>[Scoffs]

Wh... what'â€™s going on?
Why are you lying to me?

Everything'â€™s fine.
I had some tests done.

They'â€™re calling me
to go over them.

They mailed me the results.

And?

I haven'â€™t opened them yet.

<i>What? Mom, open the letter.</i>


What?

Why does it matter?
What'â€™s another two days?

This is something
I always wanted to do.

To go to the super bowl
with my friends
and see Tom Brady win.

So, no, i'â€™m not gonna
open that envelope.

Because what'â€™s inside
could ruin this for everyone.

Everyone. Where is...

I gotta go.

No, mom. Mom?

Has anyone seen guy Ferrari?

Uh, he looks like
a flamin'â€™ hot cheeto.

What is this place?

Hi.

I'â€™ll be right back.

Lou, what'â€™s the matter?

I got drugged by gummy bears.

I should go. I should go.

Maura and Betty are gone,

and the tickets are missing.

What?
What happened to the tickets?

Hot sauce.

Betty? Maura?

How high are you, Lou?

Substantially.

Oh, okay.
What you thinkin'â€™, maura?

Wouldn'â€™t you like to know?

Maura!

Are you playing poker right now?

Yeah.
Give me a sec, okay?
Yeah.

I have a great hand.

We'â€™ve gotta go.

No!
The tickets are lost!

I know.

But if I win this hand,
I can buy tickets.

Fine. Go beat him.
Go!

All right.[Gugu] all right, listen.

I know that we'â€™ve been having
all of these beautiful moments,

and I feel
very connected to you.

All of the things.

But now i'â€™ma have to
take all your money.

Mmm.
All in.

Okay.

Me too.

[Players gasp]


Sha-blam![players exclaim]

Oh, no.



[Lou screams] Yes!
You did it! Yes!

I'â€™m dead. I'â€™m totally dead.

I'â€™m totally dead. Okay.

Oh, my god.

Oh, my god.

You know what?

I think i'â€™m gonna
cash out. Okay.

Great. What charity
are you playing for?

It'â€™s a charity poker event.

Oh, my god.

[Dealer] Charity.
Right.

Uh, gugu?

Mmm?
What'â€™s your charity?

Broadway cares.

Give all of my winnings
to Broadway cares.

And I wanna thank everybody
for letting me play with you.

I had a fabulous time.

Ugh. Charity poker.

I wasn'â€™t gonna wear
a retainer for 18 months.

Right.

Doctor wong was right,

and the teeth just
went right back to
where they started.

Oh, gosh, that'â€™s terrible.

Well, you gotta roll
with the punches, you know.

It'â€™s...

You Don'â€™t understand
how hard dating is these days.

Oh, I can imagine.
I can imagine.

But let me just tell you this.

Listen to me right now.

If you wanna find love...[Scoffs]

You have to focus
on the positive,
not the negative.

There'â€™s always negative things.

Honestly, if you see someone
you think is interesting,

you look them right in the face,

and you say...

"I like the way you look."

Oh, no, not me![Lou] you too?

What are you doing?

I Don'â€™t know.
I Don'â€™t know what i'â€™m doing.

That'â€™s the problem.
It'â€™s 1:00 A.M.

Does nobody care that
we Don'â€™t have the tickets?

Lou, Lou, relax.

Oh, relax.

I should be relaxed
and in bed right now,

but i'â€™m not because
you'â€™re too busy gambling.

And you care more about
some guy you just met

than you do your friends.[Scoffs]

And you should be
more responsible,

but clearly
you Don'â€™t give a damn.

I give a damn. I give a damn.
We'â€™ll find the tickets.

When? Tomorrow'â€™s the game.

Use that big brain of yours.

I thought you were
supposed to be the smart one.


No one knows how much
this trip means to me.

Well, that'â€™s just selfish.

It means a lot to all of us.

You know, i'â€™m tired.

We'â€™re gonna find
the tickets tomorrow.

We'â€™re gonna go to the hotel,
get a good night'â€™s sleep,

and wake up all fresh.

Oh, my god.
Oh, god.

[Alarm stops]

Oh, my god, my head.

We all g... we have to get up.

We have to find our tickets.

I Don'â€™t wanna get up.
Oh. Oh, god.

Why is champagne
such a violent beverage?

Shoot.


It'â€™s my fault
as much as anybody'â€™s.

Come on. The game
doesn'â€™t start for a few hours.

We'â€™ll get tickets.

There'â€™s gotta be
a scalper somewhere.

All right. Let'â€™s meet
back here in an hour
in front of the stadium.

We'â€™ll all split up.

Okay. Hour.
In an hour.

In an hour.

["Do the push and pull" playing]


Do you know where
I could find a scalper?

I Don'â€™t think I can.
Okay, okay, okay. Got it.

Hey. Has anybody got tickets?

Okay, sorry. Sorry.

Shit.

You a scalper?

No.

You a cop?

No. How much for four tickets?

Ten thousand.

Ten thousand?

Per ticket.

I'â€™ll tell you what.

I'â€™m willing to go
100 per ticket.

That'â€™s less than face value.

175.

Move on.
I gotta find a real buyer.

Will 200 happen?
No.

You'â€™re not gonna accept
250 cash in hand?

What is wrong with you?

I'â€™m offering 300.
No.

450.
No.

500 is my ceiling.
It'â€™s my ceiling.

525.

Come on. Get outta here. No.

You know what?

When you are stuck at halftime
with those tickets,

i'â€™m gonna lowball
the shit outta you,
you son of a bitch.

550.

If my bookie were listening,

I would tell him
to put me down for,
like, five large...

Whoa... that the pats
take it by 14.

All right? But I Don'â€™t
have a bookie, so... right.

Well, hey, you heard him, Mike.

You heard that.
We'â€™re gonna be right back.

Stick around.

like that on the show.

Excuse me.
Hey.

Yeah...
We know each other, right?

God, you look very familiar.


Well, I was
the mayflower girl.
That'â€™s it.

Yeah, you were!
Oh, my god!

From the commercials
when we were kids.
Yeah, I know.

[Pat, nat] <i>â™ª tires, parts
and new cars too â™ª</i>


Are you gonna do
the whole thing?

I had a humongous thing for you
when I was about ten.

All right.
Too much. Too much.
Thank you.

That'â€™s very kind. Thank you.

Actually, I need your help.

See, my friend won
the tickets at your giveaway,

and now we'â€™ve lost them.

Uh... I Don'â€™t...

Your... your friend
won the ticket giveaway?

Uh-huh.
Yeah, I Don'â€™t...

'â€™cause these guys
won the tickets.[Pat] yeah.

They won the tickets?

Yeah.[nat] uh-huh.

That'â€™s the Tom Brady
support group.

They support Tom Brady?

No. They'â€™re all men
named Tom Brady

who formed a support group

because they'â€™re never gonna
live up to that name.

Are they even pats fans?

They'â€™re conflicted
about it, let'â€™s say.

They seem reluctantly
like they'â€™re supporting 'â€™em.
Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. They came.

[Phone ringing]
Oh.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Hi, sweetie.

<i>Okay, I was trying not to
bother you too much,</i>

<i>but, uh, which one?</i>

What?

I sent you an e-mail
with two options.

A or b?

What are you talking about?

<i>My paper.</i>

Oh. Oh, I didn'â€™t read it.

Are... are you close
to a computer?
Can you find a kinko'â€™s?

No. No, I...

I am not going to read it.

Well, are you just hungry?

<i>No, for god'â€™s sakes, Mark.</i>

I'â€™m not hungry.
I'â€™m at the super bowl
with my friends.

<i>But this is really important.</i>

To you. Not to me.

Honestly, it'â€™s your paper
with your name on it.

You have to make the decisions.

Mark, are you still there?

Yeah.

<i>Listen.</i>

<i>Honey, I...</i>

I have made a lot of sacrifices
over the years,

and i'â€™m not saying I wish
I could change any of that.

I'â€™m just saying just because
I can solve a problem

does not mean I should have to.

Okay.

I love our life.

I love our kids
and our grandkids.

I love you.

I love you too.

<i>I'â€™m sorry. Have a great time.</i>

Okay.

<i>Okay.</i> okay.


Found it! I found it!
I found it! I found it!

What can I get for you?[Chuckles] oh, is...
Is guy here?

Oh, damn. It'â€™s you.
Hi.

How are you?
Good.

How'â€™s your bowels?

That'â€™s none
of your business.
Okay.

I haven'â€™t seen guy in a while.

I think he might be
in the office.

Where'â€™s the office?


Mr. Fieri.

Mr. Fieri? Mr. Fieri...

[Occupant] Oh, hi.
Oh, god. Sorry.

Mr. Fieri?

Mr. Fieri?

Mr. Fieri?

Guy!


Oh, thank god. Thank god.

Mr. Fieri, i'â€™m sorry,
I think you have my strap-on.

Hang... hang on a second.

Oh. Oh, thank god.

Oh, Betty, it'â€™s you.

I was expecting someone else.

No. I think
you have my strap-on.

You know, I took off
during the competition.

Your Fanny pack.
Yes.

Your Fanny pack.
Yes. It went this way.

So you Don'â€™t have any tickets
to get into the actual game?

No. No,
the tickets are lost.

Did you try the lost and found?

No, no. Where is that?
Okay.

Um...

I Don'â€™t know,
actually, where that is.
Oh, g...

There'â€™s got to be some way.

If you Don'â€™t have the tickets,
then you Don'â€™t have a... [groans]

<i>It'â€™s one of those moments</i>

<i>where all the work
that you put in</i>

<i>has brought you to this moment.</i>

<i>And it'â€™s okay to be behind,</i>

<i>'â€™cause you gotta
remind yourself</i>

<i>that it'â€™s all gonna work out.</i>

No, Tom. I Don'â€™t think
it'â€™s going to work out.

They'â€™re not going to let us in.

<i>Lou, whenever i'â€™m down,</i>

<i>I say to myself,</i>

<i>"this is going to be
an amazing comeback.</i>

<i>When we come back from this,</i>

<i>this is going to be
a defining moment in my life."</i>

<i>You have to shift your mind
to think that way.</i>

<i>It'â€™s empowering.</i>

<i>Say it.</i>

<i>This is going to work out.</i>

This is gonna work out.

<i>Come on, Lou.
Like you mean it.</i>

<i>This is going to work out.</i>

This is gonna work out!

Lou! Lou!
Oh, my god.

I found them!
I found them.

We got the tickets!
We got the tickets![Shouts]

We got the tickets.
You got the tickets.

I got 'â€™em.
Oh, my god!

I got 'â€™em!
Oh, my god!

we got to go in now.
Isn'â€™t that great?

Now. Come on.
Let'â€™s go.
Yeah, great. Oh, my god.

Games, everybody.
Everybody have a ticket?

Everybody take their ticket.
Come on.

We'â€™ve got our tickets.
We'â€™ve got our tickets.

Oh, my god. This is it.

We did it.
We did do this.


Hi, welcome.
Hi.

[Machine beeps]

Oh. Uh...

Are you guys all together?
This is... [machine beeps]

These aren'â€™t... these...

I'â€™m sorry, these all
aren'â€™t super bowl tickets, so...

Yes, those are our tickets.

That'â€™s great, but
they'â€™re not super bowl tickets.

Chip,
I got another one here.
Comin'â€™.

Hot one.[Chip] let me see.

Four.[groans]

Yep, they'â€™re fake.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

You see, ladies,
the official tickets
have a hologram

that lights up under uv light.

These do not.
You'â€™ve been scammed.

Well, that'â€™s not possible.
We won them in a contest.

No, we didn'â€™t.

Lou, tell 'â€™em.

I never won the contest.

A whole bunch
of Tom Brady wannabes did.

How'â€™d you get the tickets?

I bought them online.

I maxed out a credit card,
and I sold my car to carmax.

Oh, Lou, why would you do that?

I wanted to have one last
unforgettable experience

before it was too late.

Hey, little ladies,
i'â€™m gonna need you
to move aside.

We gotta let other people
through the gate.

Well, you can start by
letting us through.

Oh, you'â€™re not getting in.
Oh!

Wha... [Trish] Oh.

When you do a double,
they get thick.
I got you.

Let'â€™s make a run.

Whoa. No.
Hey. Wait.

Maura. No.
Come on, ma'â€™am.

No, no. She... come on.
Come on. I'â€™m not hurting her.
I am not hurting her.

We know you'â€™re not.
Don'â€™t touch me!

She'â€™s coming at me.
Come on.

Okay. Fine, fine, fine.

Lou, where are you going?

What is going on?

Lou, look at me.

What did you mean when you said

"before it'â€™s too late"?

I had some tests done,

and the hospital'â€™s been
trying to reach me.

I think maybe something came up.

Oh, Lou.[Sighs]

What did they say?

I Don'â€™t know, I...

They sent me a letter,
but I haven'â€™t opened it.

Well, open it.

No, what if it'â€™s come back?

I... I can'â€™t
go through that again.

You'â€™re not alone.

We'â€™re here for you. Always.

to support you.

Isn'â€™t that what friendship is?

I mean,

that we face
the unknown together,
hand in hand?

I wouldn'â€™t wanna go through it
with anyone else.

I really love you all.

[Crowd cheering]

I guess maybe this super bowl
was never meant to be.

Oh, come on, Lou.

If you did this to give us
something to remember,

honey, it worked.

Big time.

We will always remember this.

Absolutely.

This has been
the best weekend
of my whole life.

I'â€™m not kidding you.
The very, very best.

Well, except for
the guilt I felt

because I lost the tickets,
which were fake.

And so, in retrospect,
I didn'â€™t have to feel
that guilty. Did I?

Oh, hell.
There must be a sports bar
around here somewhere.

No, no.
No, no, no, no. God.

There'â€™s got to be
a way into that stadium.

Come on.
We'â€™re not gonna give up.

We'â€™ve come too far.

No, we are not gonna
stand around this food court,

crying like a bunch of babies.

Gugu.
Yeah. Goo-goo, gaga.

No.

Gugu!

Hold on.
Gugu. Hi.

Hey.
Come on. Come on.

Maura. How are you, ladies?

Y'â€™all look fabulous.
Thank you.

I wanted to thank you properly
for last night,

but you ran out so fast.

Y'â€™all ran out.

Your donation was so beautiful.
Thank you.

You'â€™re welcome.
I was happy to do it.

Are you, um...
Are you going into the game?

Of course.

I choreographed
the halftime show.

Oh, you'â€™re...
You work with lady gaga?

I do everything with that girl.

Where you think
she got her name from?

I'â€™m gugu, she'â€™s gaga.[Laughing]

Oh, she'â€™s spectacular.
She is.

Do you think
you could get us in?

Uh, yeah,
we Don'â€™t have tickets.

Come on, ladies. Follow me.

Go, go, go.
Come on.

Hey, there. How are ya?
Doin'â€™ all right.

Hold on.
Let me see your badges.
No. No.

They'â€™re with me. They'â€™re good.
These are my dancers.

They Don'â€™t look like dancers.

Well, that'â€™s ageist.
Isn'â€™t it?

I Don'â€™t care how old they are.

They just need badges
like these dancers.


Well, uh,
they'â€™re all my dancers.

I mean... [scoffs] What?
You want us to show you?

Okay.

Okay. Um...
Y'â€™all got this. Come on.

Come on. Let'â€™s talk
about this for a second.

Okay. Um...

So what are some dance moves
you ladies know?

The twist.
Twist.

The jerk.[Lou] sh... shimmy.

Yeah, uh, step-touch.

All right.
So we'â€™ll do the step-touch,
the twist, the shimmy,

and then we'â€™ll end
with some jazz hands.

How'â€™s that?
Oh, yeah.

Okay?[Trish] yes.

One, two, three.[All] break!

All right. Let'â€™s do it.

["It'â€™s my house" playing]

Y'â€™all ready?
A little freestyle here.

And five, six, seven.

<i>â™ª It'â€™s my...
And I live here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª it'â€™s my house and I... â™ª</i>

There you go.

Oh!

[Crowd cheers, whistles]

Oh! And...

Freestyle, ladies.

Freestyle, ladies.
Come on down.

Y'â€™all did so good!

Five, six, seven and hold!

[Crowd cheering]

Damn, ladies.

Those were
some sick dance moves.

I know you'â€™re not his dancers,
but that was awesome.

Go ahead.


Extraordinary!

We have to go to work.
It'â€™s been lovely.
Okay.

Y'â€™all better fluff up
'â€™cause these ladies
are about to take your gig.

Come on, kids!

[Trish] Thank you.
Let'â€™s go.

Yo, how good were they?
Amazing.

Good lord.

["The warrior" playing]

[Crowd cheering]

[Commentator on pa]
<i>In three, two, one!</i>


Okay, where to?

Um...

Oh! Oh!
Empty seats right there.

Let'â€™s go up there.
Yeah.

All right.
Super bowl 51.

Pats nation,
welcome to super bowl li.Welcome.

<i>There'â€™s the kickoff
and we are underway.</i>

It'â€™s Tom. It'â€™s Tom.
Okay. Where?

Let'â€™s do our job!

I think this is
the best sitting down
has ever felt.

Tom Brady'â€™s in the...</i>

<i>Oh, god! He'â€™s sacked.</i>[Nat] <i>god.</i>

What the hell was that?

in the first quarter.</i>

[Phone chimes]

Who keeps texting you?

Oh, it'â€™s... it'â€™s Dan.

Well, why... why
Don'â€™t you answer him?

I Don'â€™t know.
I'â€™m ghosting him.

You know, he keeps calling...

[Air horn blows]

But I know how this works out.

He'â€™s...

He'â€™s gonna be charming,
i'â€™m gonna fall for it.

It'â€™s gonna all move too fast,

and then everything'â€™s gonna
come crashing down.

You realize ignoring him
is just gonna make him
want you more?

I mean, look at you.
Honestly, and who you are.

You'â€™re always
pushing forward
and doing new things.

Well... you'â€™re irresistible.

You know, honestly,
I Don'â€™t want to be.

I Don'â€™t wanna be irresistible.

I'â€™d like five grandkids
like you have.

Guess it'â€™s a little late
for that.
Yeah, I guess so.

I want a man I can sit next to
and not have to talk.

Well, you can have Mark.
He'â€™s real good at that.

Well, i'â€™d take him,

but he'â€™s too much
in love with you.

Look, that'â€™s us!
Oh, my god!



Tom Brady, we love you!
Look down there.

[Announcer on pa]
<i>Let'â€™s hear it for
our super bowl superfans!</i>

<i>My goodness,
I wish I had those hips.</i>

Not on me, not on my watch!

Never been so...
Sit down.
Tom, spank me.

Right here. Spank me here,
Tom.[Betty] Oh, no. Get, get...

Sit down. Oh, my god.
I'â€™m so embarrassed.

The falcons have no business
being in this contest.

it'â€™s gonna be a bloodbath.</i>

Get him! Get him!</i>

<i>Damn it!</i>

<i>Atlanta with the first
touchdown of the game.</i> Nice!

<i>Bryant, the extra point.</i>

<i>7-nothing to Atlanta.</i>

Hey!

Let'â€™s go.

Out of the seats. Now.

Come on.

Let'â€™s go, golden girls.
Let'â€™s do this.

Now, I Don'â€™t know how you ladies
got into this stadium,

but I know
how you'â€™re getting out.

Chip.

Oh, god.

Trish?

Dan.

I saw you on the jumbotron.

You weren'â€™t answering my texts.

I was... I was very preoccupied.

Dan o'â€™callahan?


When you caught
that 90-yard touchdown
pass against the oilers!

Poetry.

I mean, devastating for me
as an oilers fan

but poetry.
Thank you.

Dan, he'â€™s kicking us out.
What?

Well, yeah.
They Don'â€™t have tickets.

Well, they'â€™re in the box
with me.

See you, chip.

Ready?


Wow.

This is how
people watch football?

This is heaven.

I know.
It'â€™s called a skybox.

I'â€™m sorry I was angry with you

for hooking up with him
in that broom closet.

I'â€™m glad you did.

We were just kissing.

Come on.
Let'â€™s see the view.


Oh, look at this.

You get such a great sense
of the whole field from up here.

You can see everything.

Exactly. Hey.

You see that box
right across the way?

That'â€™s the coordinator'â€™s booth.[Lou]
that'â€™s where they call the plays.

Wait, you mean
those guys are talking
directly to Tom Brady?

Mm-hmm.
Oh, what a dream.

Hey, grab a seat.

Let me know
if you need anything.
Yeah.

Dan, i'â€™m sorry
I didn'â€™t call you back.

It'â€™s just...

Sometimes I have a tendency
to go too quickly, you know?

That'â€™s okay. I get it.

There'â€™s no pressure.

Let'â€™s spend some time together,
see what happens.

[Phone ringing]

Hey, Mickey. <i>Hey.</i>

Um, listen.

Some people around here,
they'â€™ve been asking about you.

Some are under the impression
that you'â€™ve been kidnapped,
you know,

so they questioned me
for about three hours.

Of course, i'â€™m no snitch,
you know that.

Thank you.
That'â€™s really nice,

but I Don'â€™t want
anybody to worry.

You can be a snitch.
Go ahead.

Okay. [Chuckles]

<i>So, when are you coming back?</i>

<i>Some of the residents
around here,</i>

they'â€™ve been, uh,
been eyeing your room.

You know, i'â€™ve been
trying to keep them away,

but they'â€™re like vultures,
you know?

You know what, Mickey?

Tell them they can have it.

Does that mean you'â€™re leaving?

<i>I'â€™m moving back to my house,</i>

<i>but you can come over
whenever you want.</i>

Oh.

Yeah. Sure.

<i>Go pats, huh?</i>

Go pats! [Chuckles]

still 0-7, falcons leading.</i>

<i>And...</i>

<i>That'â€™s not gonna do it.</i>

Hey, what do you think
a box like this costs?

245,000.


You wanna bet?
Yeah.

What kind of buffoon
would spend all that money?

Me.

Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

Well, thank you for having me.

Well, I Don'â€™t know who you are,
but i'â€™m glad you could make it.

You'â€™re welcome.

protection holds up.</i>

<i>He lets it fly.</i>

<i>End zone,
touchdown, Austin hooper.</i>

<i>Falcons,
now a two-touchdown lead.</i>

You stink!

Yeah, you tell 'â€™em.

Hooper touchdown.
Who the hell is this guy?
Come on.

<i>Brady looks, throws.</i>

<i>And it'â€™s picked! Oh!</i>[Crowd cheers]

<i>Intercepted by Robert alford.</i>

an 82-yard pick-six
for rocky alford.</i>

<i>Touchdown.</i>


Oh, Tom, come on.


Somebody better be saying
something really inspiring

in that locker room
right now.
I hope so.

here in the third quarter.</i>


It just takes one play.

One play and then
you got momentum
and then...


<i>End zone touchdown.</i>

<i>28-3. This one
has been all Atlanta.</i>


Wow.
That sucked.

28-3. What'â€™s happening?

Well, it'â€™s just
the third quarter.

They could still come back.

Well, i'â€™m sorry
for your loss, ladies.


but we have not lost yet.

No.[chuckles]

Do you know
what the patriots'â€™ chances

of pulling this one out are?

One percent?
Close.

They have
a .7% chance of winning.

I still think
they can pull it out.

I wouldn'â€™t bet on it.

[Stadium announcer]
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
as a reminder,</i>

<i>we will have the official
lombardi trophy presentation</i>

<i>at the conclusion of this game.</i>

Pardon my language,
but screw this.

Are you leaving?

I'â€™m gonna do something
about it.

You can stay here
if you want to,

but this is not
how my super bowl ends.

Hey, hang on to this.
We got a deal.

What'â€™s up?
Let'â€™s go. Let'â€™s go.

What?
Let'â€™s go. Come on.

Lou?

in the third quarter,

and we are down by...

A lot. It'â€™s a lot.
Yeah.

It is not looking good,
pats nation.
No.

We gotta find a way
to get the ball
in the end zone.

We got no choice but to stay
in our two-minute offense

for the rest of the game.
We got no time left.

Hey!

[Coach 1] Let'â€™s go cover two.[Coach 2]
cover two. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Double on Julio.
Watch the scene.

[Coach 1] Over Matt too.

Let'â€™s go. Cover two.
No, no. Go to cover one.

Go to cover one.
What are you doing?

You can'â€™t be in here.
Listen to me now.

It frees mccourty
to play the run,

get some sort of
creative blitz going here.

You'â€™ve got great linebackers.
Use 'â€™em, for god'â€™s sakes.

Why are we in cover one?

What? No. Cover two. What?

[Players grunting]

Yes![coach 2] let'â€™s go!

Tom?
Hey, you can'â€™t touch that.
What...

You wanna get to her,
you gotta go through me.

Leave them. They can stay.

What else you got?
Okay.

Tom? Tom, can you hear me?

[On helmet speaker]
<i>Can you hear me, Tom?</i>

<i>Up here.</i>

<i>Tom, can you hear me?</i>

<i>Can you hear me, Tom?</i>

Up here. Up here.

Up here.

I'â€™m louella.
I'â€™m your biggest fan.

I Don'â€™t know if this is
the right time to talk.

Sixteen years ago,
I was in the middle of chemo,

feeling like I was done,
like I had nothing more in me.

And then you came on the TV,

fearless, determined,
a skinny little rookie.

Watching you play that season

gave me something extra
to look forward to.

Each week,
I found strength in that,

and that strength got me
through my treatments.

But that was 16 years ago,

and i'â€™ve enjoyed
every moment since.

And i'â€™m sure you enjoyed
winning all those super bowls.

But that was the past,
and we can'â€™t live in the past.

No matter how good
or how bad it was.

Right now
we have this one moment,

and you'â€™re down
in this game, a lot.

But you'â€™re Tom Brady.

You have to come back.

That'â€™s what you do best.

And I love you
because you are the best.

And anyone who doesn'â€™t
love you respects you

because you fight
and you never give up.

So i'â€™m not giving up either.

I Don'â€™t know
what'â€™s ahead for me,

but if you fight, i'â€™ll fight.

Now go out there and win.

Let'â€™s go!

Let'â€™s fucking go!

[Players shout, cheer]

How was that?
That was...

Beautiful.[Lou laughs]

All yours.

Let'â€™s go, offense.
Offense is up. Let'â€™s go.

<i>Come on.
We got a super bowl to win.</i>

Hey! Hey,
there'â€™s nine minutes left
and they'â€™ve got momentum.

If they pull this off,
it'â€™ll be the greatest comeback
in NFL history.

Oh, my god.

Actually, in 'â€™93,

the bills came back
from a much larger deficit,

but who'â€™s talking statistics?

Betty, what are you doing?
Come on.

All right. That just
puts us two touchdowns

and two two-point
conversions away.
And two... yeah.

Yeah, exactly. Two touchdowns
and two... so that'â€™s doable.

That'â€™s all they gotta do.

That'â€™s all they gotta do.
Oh, my god.

We gotta play harder.

Gotta play tougher.
Harder, tougher everything.

and that'â€™s a fumble.</i>

<i>New england recovers.</i>

<i>Something has really
gotten into the patriots.</i>

We got the ball back.

This is too stressful.
Oh, god.


<i>Connects with amendola.
Touchdown patriots.</i>


Amendola.
Oh, my god.
That was nice.

He'â€™s got a skull
like a baby bird'â€™s,

but his hands are like midas.

<i>Brady throws up two.</i>

<i>Two-point conversion,
here we go.</i>

<i>It'â€™s a direct snap
to James right through.
Right through.</i>

He'â€™s in there!
Oh, he'â€™s got it.

Give Tom an Oscar for that.</i>

<i>I thought that was it.
Oh, my god.</i>


<i>Someone must have said
something inspiring to Brady,</i>

<i>'â€™cause he is on fire.</i>

[Announcer 2]
<i>It'â€™s a one-score game.</i>

<i>Matt up in the pocket.</i>

<i>Now gonna cut it loose,
looking for Julio.</i>

<i>What a catch!</i>

<i>He made a catch! Unbelievable!</i>

Matty ice.[Nat] oh, my god.</i>

<i>Oh, my god.
He can'â€™t kick it from there.</i>

Attaboy, flowers. Come on.

<i>Two and a half minutes left.</i>

<i>We gotta get
down the field here, kid.</i>



I caught it. It'â€™s crazy.
I swear to god.

No way. Look at that.
Watch.

Look there.
Yo.

with the football.</i>

<i>They'â€™re saying it'â€™s a catch.</i>

<i>It'â€™s a catch! It'â€™s a catch!</i>

<i>It'â€™s a catch!</i>[Pat] <i>that is
the greatest catch...</i>

Oh, my freaking lord... in NFL history.

Off his leg.

After review,
the ruling on the field
is confirmed.


That'â€™s crazy.

<i>Passes it off to James white,</i>

<i>who runs it into the end zone.</i>

<i>And he'â€™s in there.
He'â€™s in there.</i>[Nat] <i>oh, my god!</i>

Two points away.</i>

Oh, my god, James white.
You beauty.

We need a two-point conversion.
We only have a minute left.

Miracles happen.
They happen every day.

<i>Quick screen to amendola
and he'â€™s in.</i>

It'â€™s tied! It'â€™s tied!
He tied it! He tied it!

<i>The ball crossed the line.
He is in.</i>

Way to go.

Let'â€™s go!

Tom Brady!

Oh, my god.
Overtime for the first time

in super bowl history.
Oh, my god.

Holy sh... oh, my god.
We are going to overtime.

Hey, would somebody get him
his blood pressure cuff?

Oh, my god.

It'â€™s not over. It'â€™s not over.
Stay focused.

[Referee on pa]
Gentlemen, we'â€™re about to
begin an overtime period

that will continue
until a winner is determined.

It is sudden death,

unless the first team
to possess kicks a field goal,

in which case the other team
will have an opportunity.

This is heads.
This is tails.

New england gets to
call the toss.

Heads.
They have called heads.

It is heads.
We'â€™ll take the ball.

Yes!
Yes! Yes!

Okay, okay, okay.
Okay. Hear me.

Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

Let'â€™s go score
and win this thing, baby.
Yeah. Here we go.

<i>Amendola with the catch.</i>

<i>Tom Brady to hogan.</i>


A few more for good measure.</i>

I think i'â€™m gonna throw up,
and this is the best
experience of my life.


Fifteen yards. Here we go.</i>

<i>Nice.</i>[pat] <i>this is it,
piece by piece.</i>

<i>We'â€™re marching.</i>


<i>Couldn'â€™t hold onto it.</i>

Come on, Tom. You'â€™ve got this.

Green 19!

[Crowd cheering][Announcer] <i>he'â€™s in!</i>

<i>Patriots win the super bowl.</i>[Crowd cheers]

I cannot be... come here.


Oh, my god.
I love you, kid.

They did it!

You did it.

No, we did it.

We did it. We did it.

["I'â€™ll be holding on" playing]

[No audible dialogue]

Oh, it was worth every penny.


Lou, how much
did you spend on this?

Mmm. A lot.

I might be able
to help with that.

What do you mean?

In the third quarter,
I made a bet with that rich guy

that the pats would
come back and win.

How much did you win?

A lot.

But he didn'â€™t have
enough cash on him,
so the poor guy...

I just had to, uh...

Take this.

Oh, my god.[Chuckling]

So you'â€™re the women
that broke into
the coaches'â€™ booth.

I did. I'â€™m the one.

I should'â€™ve known.

Come with me.
All of you.

No, no. Don'â€™t take them.
You'â€™re not going alone.

You sure walk slow.

Yeah. Walking with authority.

I'â€™m sorry. I know
we shouldn'â€™t have done it.

But someone had to do something.

They were gonna lose.

I can'â€™t believe
we'â€™re doing this.
What'â€™s gonna happen to us?

haven'â€™t been to jail since 'â€™67.

Hey!

[Players cheering]


Oh, my god.

Oh, my god.
You'â€™re Danny amendola.

Yeah.
Danny amendola,

you have
the highest catch percentage

of anyone out there.

You are reliable.

Oh, that'â€™s the nicest thing
anybody'â€™s ever said to me.

What do you mean?
I'â€™m sure they say that
to you all the time.

Is this yours?
Oh, yeah. I'â€™m sorry.
It'â€™s sweaty.

Oh, yes, it'â€™s very sweaty.
And does your head actually...

I wanna shave you.

Yeah.


Gronk.
Hi.

Have you...
Have you read this book?

I take it everywhere I go.[Gasps]

You'â€™re so big.

Thank you.


Tom.

I wanna thank you
for what you did out there.

Thank you so much.

I should say the same to you.

Oh, what a day.

Can you believe it?
No.

Thanks for saying all that.

I Don'â€™t know how you did it,

but your words
meant the world to me.

We were down.

You knew just what I needed.[Chuckles]

You know,
I play a game that I love,

this game of football,

and it'â€™s taught me so much.

And people say all the time,
"you inspire me," and...

It'â€™s just a game.

What you'â€™ve been through,
how tough you are,

you inspire me.

And your courage inspires me,

so thank you.

You'â€™re welcome.

And I love that Jersey.

Wow.

Could we do a Jersey swap?

This Jersey for your Jersey?
Yeah.

And it'â€™s all sweaty
and everything?
It'â€™s got a lot of sweat on it.

All right. I can do it.
Yes.

That one is...
I'â€™ve never had anything
with the sequins like that.

Where is my Jersey?

It was just right here.

Well, you know,
you can send it to me.

I will.

Of course.

<i>The tampa bay buccaneers
will start this season</i>

<i>with a new quarterback
at the helm.</i>

<i>Forty-three-year-old Tom Brady
will try to
turn around a franchise</i>

<i>that hasn'â€™t even been
to the post-season since 2007.</i>

<i>At this point,</i>

<i>i'â€™ve learned to never doubt
what Brady is capable of,</i>

<i>but you have to imagine...</i>
Game'â€™s about to start.

Hey, guys.

Come on.
The game is about to start.

Okay.
How'â€™s the guacamole?

It'â€™s done.
Let'â€™s see.

No. More onion.
Come on.

More onion? Of course.
I think
you'â€™re doing just fine.

Well, she'â€™s a woman
who knows what she wants.

It'â€™s about to begin.
We'â€™re coming. We'â€™re coming.

Hurry.

Before anyone else does,
I wanna make a toast.

To a new season,

a new team,

and to the woman
who brought us all together.

Wait a minute,
where the heck is she?

Mom, come on!


I was in the garage,
getting chips.

To our healthy quarterback.
Oh. [Scoffs]

tampa bay.</i> Kickoff. Hurry up.

<i>There'â€™s the whistle.
This is the kickoff,
and we are underway.</i>

So when are you gonna retire?

I Don'â€™t like to
use the word "retire."
It sounds so final.

I Don'â€™t "retire."
I just change careers.

Often.

Technically,
I took a sabbatical
many years ago,

and I just never returned
to work.

I wasn'â€™t asking you girls.
I was asking him.

You know, i'â€™ve thought a lot
about retirement.

But it'â€™d be a shame
to retire if you feel
like you still got it.

Join the club.

Yeah. I'â€™ll drink to that.
Hear! Hear!

Me too.
Look at this spot.

Cheers.
Tampa. Who knew?

["Gonna be you" playing]
