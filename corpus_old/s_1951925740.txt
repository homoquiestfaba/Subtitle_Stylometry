Subbed by EhLaNa

Jeff Dunham, I'm talking to you my man.
This is your night and this is your time.

You're gonna put the smackdown on that crowd like 50 Cent.

You're gonna get it crunk like Usher.

Like the Ushers?

Oh man, I gotta think white, think white...

You mean: going to do well like Toby Keith.
Huh?

I think I get it.
You're my man Jeff.

Thanks Sweet Daddy.

Group hug?

What???

Uh...Ok Jeff.
You can put me down now...

We got a show to do.

They're waiting for ya.

Ah...Shit

JEFF DUNHAM:
"Arguing with Myself"

Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Jeff Dunham.

Thank you!

Thank you so much!

Alright!

Thank you

You are assuming way to much,
ladies and gentlemen

But thanks for coming out tonight.
I am happy to be in Orange County.

I'm happy to be in Santa Ana.

My mother-in-law had a dance studio.
She had this dance studio for 30 years.

She owned it and she ran it.

A few months ago, she was 4 days away
from closing the sail on the dance studio

She was gonna take the money, retire,
be independent and live out the rest of her life.

Then, the hurricanes came...
Guess where my mother-in-laws dance studio was?!

West Palm Beach,
Florida.

Guess who's living with me
and my family now in Los Angeles??!!

I'll say it again: I am happy to be in Santa Ana.

Where is Chris Rock,
when you need the man?

In one house, it's me,
my wife, three little girls

..3 female dogs, 2 female rats
, 1 female fish

Now my mother-in-law and
as a bonus, my sister-in-law.

I am growing a uterus as we speak.

The only other male in the household,
is my golden retriever: Bill.

And they had him neutered.

Oh, it's very sad. I came home
after being gone for about 5 days

I walked in the front door.
Bill is lying on the coach.

He looks up like:
"Dude...

You're not going to believe
what they did to me...

"Run!"

Who is this?

Ladies, meet me in the green room!!

Well, our daughters are now 8, 10
and god forbid, 14 years of age.

Thanks for your sympathy.

My wife and I recognize that we are
living on the verge of hell.

Because from what I understand,
when woman live in the same house,

apparently, God has a sense of humor.

Because eventually their biological time clocks synchronize

So I know when all my daughters get to be that age,

I'll be sitting on the phone with my agent
every 3 and a half weeks going:

"You gotta get me the hell out of here!!"

My office door will be locked and all I hear is:

"Daddy...

Let us in..."

Bill will be sitting next to me:
"Don't open the door!"

Well, I know that some of you know
what's going on this evening.

I have little people in boxes and ahh...

I gotta tell ya,
the way security is at the airports nowadays

when you try and check in
with a small person in your luggage...

They stop ya.

Most airports nowadays have the sophisticated
equipment for checking your luggage

They are like big MRIs,
they can check the contents, the materials...

but some of the smaller airports, don't.
We all know Burbank airport,
just north of here a few miles.

Don't have all the sophisticated stuff,
they still have to handcheck a lot of luggage.

I was in line, about 3 1/2 weeks ago,
early one morning, very crowded

And most people, when you get your
luggage handchecked, it's no big deal

They might pull out your underwear, like uhw..

But for me, they're pulling out dolls.

I told him not to
do that joke.

And I figured out the way they decide,
who's luggage they're gonna handcheck

It is a complete judgement call
on these guys parts.

They look at you and they decide and
apparently I look like a terrorist with a trunk.

Because as:"Sir, I gotta take a look at that trunk".
I'm like: "Uh crap, here we go!"

So he takes the big trunk and
he puts it on the top of the silver table

He opens it up and the first thing he pulls out
is one of my little guys: Peanut.

You'll see him in a little while,
you know my little Peanut.

But he pulls Peanut out and he's like: "He."
and people in line are like: "Hey!"

And I'm like "Ohh..."

Now, they have these swabs and
they swab whatever it is they're looking at

they then take the piece of material,
they put it in the analyzer

it then checks to see if your stuff has come
into contact with anything dangerous.

Chemicals or whatever.

So the guy has Peanut in one hand,
swab in the other

This is all true, it's too stupid to make up.

He could have swabbed Peanut
on the head, on the foot...

No, in front of God and everybody,
he swabs his butt, just like that.

I know it's only a puppet...
But I work with the guy.

There's a relationship here!

And I'm sitting there watching this and
the first thing I find myself thinking is:

You sick bastard!

What the hell...?!

Why are you wiping my friends butt?

He then takes the swab,
puts it in the machine, shuts the door

I think we're finished.
We start to put things away....

Suddenly the little machine goes:

Three more guys come out,
they have me up against the wall.

they're checking my ID,
they're doing a background check on the internet.

They're going through all my stuff,
takes 15 minutes.

Now we're finished
Everything is fine.

Then we start to put things back
and then I start to think...

What the hell...

was on Peanuts butt...

that labelled me the potential terrorist?

This is all true and I asked the guy
and he goes:

Well, it's all in code on the computer.
Let's see.

He goes: "Eh, that would be militairy grade
plastic explosives". And I go: "Hehehe.."

"What???"

And he goes: "Well, sometimes the machine confuses lotion for that..."

And I went: "Haha!
No, there is no lotion on the puppets ass!"

I've been building bombs in my garage.

You caught me skippy!

Thanks for
straightening me out!

I don't ever want to go
through the Burbank airport again.

There was only a small number of
these guys doing all the checking

I know the next time I'll go through,
they'll all be standing in a group
and one of them will point and go:

"There he is! There's the gay puppet bomber!"

"There's lotion on his puppets ass"

You two girls are twins right?

Ladies and gentlemen, I have a few guys
to introduce to you tonight

The first guy I met years ago
when I was still in college

and he's a Vietnam war veteran

And he was a welder at the time.

He'd been married for many, many years

And he was just tired of being in the house
and wanted to get out

He saw what I did on weekends

He thought it would be fun just to
get up in front of people and just talk

give his point of views
on all kinds of subjects.

So we tried it a few times,
I thought he was great

We've been a team ever since.
Please help me welcome my old friend: Walter

Shut the hell up!

Walter, you're happy to be here?
Oh, overjoyed!

Last week, I was lying on a beach in Mali
and I couldn't decide

Should I stay in Hawai or go to friggin Santa Ana?

My God, I can die happy now!

Fine city
I don't give a damn

What's wrong with you?
I don't know

It's hot as hell outside,
my skin is a drie and itchy,

You put me in a sweater

Sure as hell, not gonna ask you for lotion.

You know you don't have to do this
Yeah, I can get a real job

What would you do?
I wanna be a greeter at Wal-Mart

What the hell is so funny?!

At Wal-Mart,
what would be your opening line?

Welcome to Wal-Mart,
get your shit and get out!

Have a nice day.

Anything else wrong?
I don't know

My wife and I couldn't find any place to park
anywhere near this stinkin joint

And some jerk pulled up in a brand new mercedes,
goes right in the handicap spot.

He gets out of the car and
there's nothing wrong with him.

Don't you hate that?

So I ran his ass over.

I made an honest man out of him.

And his mother got out the other side,
started swinging her crutches at me.

Took her out with the door.

Don't you feel kinda bad?
Oh hell, ain't carpool

Do you think the police didn't see ya?
I ain't afraid of the cops around Santa Ana

You seen some of these guys?
What?

Cops on bicycles.

What's wrong with that?
How intimidating is this:

"Sorry buddy, pull it over"

What do they do when they arrest somebody?
"Alright, in the basket"

Yes ladies...
I wrote that joke.

Yeah, you can tell the rookie cops.
They got playing cards in their spokes.

"Halt!"

So your wife's in town?
Oh, yeah!

She's having a good time?
She always has a good time

Pisses me off

She's a lovely lady!
She's gettin old

Well, women age like fine wine

She's aging like milk

Did you guys get into another argument this morning?
Yeah

What happened?
I don't know

She rolled out of bed,
jumped on her minstrel cycle

and ran my ass over.

Never heard it put quite that way before

Oh it even has a sound.
It goes:

<Nag, nag, bitch, bitch>

How long have you been married?
Uh, what is it now? 46 years

What was the happiest moment of your life?

47 years ago

How long have you been married?
15 years

You'll see

I'll see what?
Remember when you said:

"Till death do us part"?
Yeah

Later, you'll realize
you're actually setting a goal.

Walter, what exactly is marriage to you?
It's like drinking a slurpy

First couple of sips are like:
"Boy, this is really good. I'm glad I did this"

Then you keep drinking it,
goes right to your head and you go..

"What the hell was I thinking?!"

"Someone kill me please!"

But eventually it stops hurting

Yeah, but then you're stupid enough
to take another friggin sip.

Ain't the same anymore is it?
What?

Being married all these years.
You can't look at other women now.

you can't talk to them,
you can't do nothing.

What are you talking about?
I'll show you what I'm talking about...

See this lovely young lady
sitting right here in the front row

This gorgeous young thing?

Do you see her?
Yeah...

Oh well...

Only thing you can do now
is run to the end of your chain and bark.

Getting married is kind of
like buying a new car

You know when you see that car in the
showroom floor just before you take it home...

Yeah..
That is as good as it's ever gonna look

Pretty soon, it will have dents and scratches.
Parts start to go bad.

Then the new models comes out
and then you're like:...

"Honey, can I just sit in it?"
No, remember?

Walter, how's the love life?
You mean sex?

Yes
I'm married, you morron!

I'm too old too
You're not too old

How would you know?
Well, I don't know, but I do know

I had grandparents who well into their eighties,
where still having fun.

Their eighties?
Good God...

What the hell kinda sex is that?

"Was it good for you?"
"I can't remember"

"We just finished!"
"Who are you?"

Are you trying to tell me there's nothing
sexually going on between you and your wife?

It's very difficult.
She gripes about everything.

Like what?

She said I don't make
the right noises during sex

Sorry to hear that
Wanna hear what I do?

No

Alright, you talked me into it.
Wait a minute...

Now be careful,
these are gonna be kind of pornographic

"Get off"

"I can't see the weather channel!"

"Get the hell off!"

Oh, now that's funny!
Wait, no it's not.

I know you know better than I do, but I mean
is there any kind of foreplay for you guys?

Foreplay?
At our age?

Yeah, it's come down to:
"Hey, wake up!"

You know what oral sex for us is?
What?

She screams: "Screw you!"
and I yell: "Bite me!"

Come on Walter, at your age,
how do you keep things fresh in the bedroom?

BRISE.

I don't know. My wife and I heard
that coffee's good for your sex life

Coffee?
Is it?

No, it kept me awake
through the whole damn thing.

I actually had to participate!

Doctor said it's bad for my heart too.

Oh, the caffeine?
No, seeing my wife naked

That's awful!
Oh, you seen her too?

So, is coffee good for the sex life or not?

I don't know, but they're never gonna
let us go back into that Starbucks again!

Well, we used the filter!

You know Walter -despite how you act-, I bet when
you were younger you were quite a ladiesman

I used to chase skirts all over the world.

Really?
Till I got to Scotland...

and boy, was I surprised!

So you had women everywhere?
I even dated a girl in India

 Really?
Lovely young lady. Weird ass country.

What's wrong with India?
I don't now

Most of the women got a red dot
in the middle of their forehead.

What the hell is that?
"You are here"

Maybe it lights up
when the coffee is ready?

Sorry

"Scratch it off, you friggin win something!!"
Will you stop?!

How about this: "Hey looks like
she's videotaping me all the time!"

As everybody was coming in tonight, they were
given an opportunity or two to ask you a question

So before the show started, I grabbed a small handful.
I think you should answer them.

I don't give a damn

You pall here in the blue shirt, in the front row...
You filled one out?

Hello!

DID YOU FILL ONE OUT?

Where are you going?!
Sit the hell down!

You bastard, this is TV!

What the hell?

Think he's gonna take a piss?

These are expensive tickets, extensive set-up,
lot of production

Divide it all up, if he's gone for 3 minutes,
he's taking a 600 dollar piss!

Dumbass.

Is he coming back?

Ok

We'll wait.

What's that guys first name?
Mike!

Mike.
Dumbass.

Are there speakers up in the bathroom?
Yes

Oh Mike!!

Whe are waiting for you, Mike!!

Kinda of tough to go
with all this pressure isn't it, Mike?!

Mike!

Get out!!

Mike's taking a long time...

Could be having trouble...

What does Mike do for a living?

Transportations

He does transportation?

What the hell does that mean?

Medical transportation

Medical transportation?!

What the fuck is that?!

Welcome back, dumbass!

Mike, could you hear us in there?

Mike!

Somebody pull his string.
He's not talking.

Mike, could you hear us in there?

I could't hear it.

Well, we could hear you.

And you didn't wash your hands!

I don't give a damn

Back to you, asswhole.

I'm sorry, just kiddin around.
What is your first name, here in the blue shirt?

Nick.

Nick, what do you do for a living?

I work in construction
What kind of construction?

I work with a general contractor
With a general contractor

You're not the general contractor?
You work WITH one.

So what is your title, Nick?
I guess you could consider it framing and drywalling.

framing and drywalling...

Got anything for that, dumbass?

You know Nick, we got jokes for doctors
and lawyers and even trash collectors.

But the framing and drywalling guy...

Not in our arsenal of snatty come-backs!

Now we're not gonna bother
going home and writing any

cos hey...
what are the fucking odds now ?

I'm sorry

It was Nick right?
Yeah

Nick and Mike.
Mike and Nick.

Dumbasses.

Would you be nice to the crowd?
I don't give a damn

Some of the folks signed these and some of them didn't
I don't give a damn

Where is Valerie...? What is it?
What is it... Ramney... Ramsey...

Valerie, where are ya?
Right there

"Dear Walter, how do you take
off ten years to look younger?"

Oh, me? That would be Thompson's WaterSeal.

This is from Milton: "Dear Walter,
my wife sits at home all day and won't work."

"How can I get her to get a job?"

Well Milton, you're going to have to die.

That'll teach the bitch!

Where is Nick Manos?
Right here!

Nick!

Nick says: "Dear Walter,
you're looking a little frustrated."

"When is the last time you got laid?"

Oh crap, I recognize him.
That's our gay stalker!

I need medical transportation!

This is from Steven: "Dear Walter,
could you please recommend a good proctologist?"

Tony Whittier.
Oh, Tony from Whittier, California.

Pay attention, idiot
I'm sorry

"Dear Walter, time and time again
I have filled out this sheet, 6 times."

"You never answer my question. What gives?"

Let's skip that one
Ok

This is from Chris,
it's a girl Chris

"Dear..."
You read this

"Dear Walter, after 9 1/2 years my boyfriend
still hasn't 'popped' the question"

That says 'poop' the question!!

Chris, you need to learn to spell I think

How the hell do you 'poop' the question?

I guess you should
listen from the other end...

"Dear Walter, why don't chicken
breasts have nipples?"

What?!

I guess cos if they got too cold,
they'd poke a whole in the package.

New from the Colonel:
"Chicken and Tits"

"Dear Walter, what is one of Jeffs
deepest darkest secrets?"

He has a sex blow up doll

No I don't
Yes you do

No
Yes and the sick part is...

he makes her talk...

And boy, does she lie!
Will you stop it!

"Dear Walter, what was your
favorite toy as a child?"

Dirt

And we were happy

Kids nowadays, they have too much.
They got the internet, videogames, computer crap.

Hell they're even passing out condoms
in highschools, did you know that?

Yeah
Good God

When I was that age, we had to
walk 5 miles to get a condom

Up hill.

In the snow.

With a boner!
Oh stop it!

I threw this one away, cos
I thought it was kinda over the line

but I think we crossed that
a couple of times

You read it
Why?

I just can't. You read it.
Ok, I don't care

"Dear Walter, why is it that I
gag when I brush my tongue,

but not when I give my boyfriend oral sex?"

Well obviously, your toothbrush is bigger

That's Walter! There we go! Alright!

Thank you!

Thank you so much

And now ladies and gentlemen...

Folks, every once in a while, a fear in showbusiness

you feel the need to reinvent yourself.
Redo things.

Make the creative juices keep flowing

I felt not long ago,
it was time for me to do that

so I fired my current manager
and hired a new one.

He's actually here this evening and before I go
any further, he wanted to come out and say a few words

We are getting to know eachother,
he's getting to know my audiences.

I think you're really going to enjoy him,
because he's a smart guy. I really respect him.

Please help me welcome
my new manager Sweet Daddy D.

Well, it's about time.
These folks were waiting to see me...

How are you doing Sweet Daddy?
Oh no, it's not Sweet Daddy, it's Sweet Daddy D.

Well, I'm happy to call
you my new manager

I'm what you call a player
in a management profession.

Right.

P.I.M.P.

You're a pimp?
That makes you the hoe!

I'm not a whore
What do you do for a living?

Make people laugh
Make them feel good?

Right
You're the hoe

That's not right
Why do you do what you do?

Why? Because I enjoy it and it's
the best way I know to make money

You're the hoe!

Wait a minute, what if I said
I only do it because of the money?

You're the dumb hoe.

So what ideas do
you have for my career?

The first thing I gotta
do is school you in street

Street?
Word

What?
Word

What word?

What?

You said: "Word".
Word

What word?
Oh snap, what the hell?

Dog, "word" is like:
"I heard that?"

Heard what?
Oh shit

Dog, you are not white.
You're neon white

You're so white,
you make Barry Manilow look like a brother.

I like Barry Manilow.
Are you gay?

No

I heard about the lotion.

I'm not gay
You're just white.

Yeah
It's all good

Look, do you think this is gonna work between us?
Let's make an analogy here...

If we were food...

I would be a fine summer wine
that would be divine anytime

What about me?
Every good wine needs a cracker!

That's funny shit right there!

You gotta laugh at that shit

We got a fine hoochy
momma right here

Hello??!!!

You're looking to go home
with some real wood?

You like it?!

I may be short, but it
ain't my feet holding me up

Sweet Daddy, what are you doing?
Trying to find me some hoes, dog!

Hoes?

Oh you mean women!
Oh I got it!

Word!!!

Don't you ever do that again!!

I don't know what the hell that was, but
you just embarrassed the hell out of everybody

Even the white folks are sitting there going:
"What the fuck was that?"

You know us black folks got a saying

Stay black
Right.

I got some advice for you
What?

Stay white

I know a lot of white people
emulate the Afro-American culture

To make themselves seem cooler.
Yeah, us black folks got a word for that...

What?
Irritating

So I'll say it again and it goes
for most everybody in this room

I'll stay black,
You stay white.

As for my Mexican
brothers and sisters...

You learn English mothafuckers,
how bout that?

That's funny shit right there!

Oh Lord, I'm glad
I'm going home in a suitcase

Look Sweet Daddy, who
are some of your other clients?

I can't tell you that...
Why?

I gotta protect their anonymity
Well...

Give us a hint then.
How bout some initials?

O.J.
Oh shit!

So you have some athletes and former athletes?
Oh, sure enough

So you like sports?
Oh yeah

I like sports,
lets talk about sports

What do you think about the
hockey strike we had not long ago?

The what...?

You know, the hockey strike
Oh yeah

Me and all the brothers were laying
around the hood everyday going:

"Oh Lord, what do we do with no hockey?!"

"Thank the Lord, we got NASCAR!"

NASCAR, that's another
dumbass crack of sport!

NASCAR is very popular
I know that, I just don't get it!

Lots of grown, white men going
500 miles, in a circle?!

What the hell?!

What kind of sleen half (?) is this:
"Look, they're making a left turn"

"Oh, they're making another left turn"

"Oh, they're making another left turn"

I wonder what's gonna happen next???

"Let's go to commercial, come back in 10 minutes,

you ain't gonna miss a fuckin thing!"

He is that the dude that Walter was talking to?

Right there

I was talking to him
outside before the show

He was dissin me
on my threads

Oh, he didn't like your clothes
That's right

And he asks: "How come your name is Sweet
Daddy?" You know what I said to him?

Ask your momma!!

Don't get all up in my grill dog,
you know it ain't just me up here...

And if I'm not funny,
it's not my fault

See dog, I'm kinda like coffee
Coffee?

Yeah, before you experience my brown goodness...
I gotta go through a big ass white filter.

That's funny shit right there!

So Sweet Daddy, do you like the audience here?
I love your crowd...

But I feel a little bit outnumber...

Is there one other brother
in the house tonight?

Yo dog!
Run!

Start up the car, I need you
out back after the show!

It's like we're at a Dwight Yokum concert,
or some shit like that

Look Sweet Daddy, before you go...
Why did you choose me as a client?

Because you're safe.
I'm what?

I gotta lot of clients ending up in jail and in trouble.
I don't see you putting your ass in jail anytime soon.

<nothing>

Unless of course,
they make lotion illegal...

Will you please drop the lotion?
Ok, but I ain't picking it up anywhere near your ass!

That's Sweet Daddy D!

Thank you!

And now ladies and gentlemen,
how do we describe this next guy?

Pretty much just white, trash trailer park.

Please help me welcome, Bubba J.

How are you doing Bubba J?
I'm doing pretty good!

Well, I'm glad you're here
Yeah, I was fixin' to coming here

And I went out the
front door to come here

And I came here,
and I got here

And here I am!

So Bubba J,
what does the J stand for?

My last name is Junior.

It's a good thing they didn't name you Junior
Yeah, that'll be dumb: Junior Junior.

That's my brothers name.

What have you been doing today?

I've been watching NASCAR
and drinking beer!

That's your favorite sport
Yeah, NASCAR is too!

NASCAR is very hot right now.

I know, everybody loves NASCAR!

Well, Sweet Daddy says it's just
a bunch of guys driving in a circle.

I know, that's my favorite part

"They're making a left turn!"

It's a sport that's easy
to follow when you're hammered.

I understand you got a new tattoo
Yeah, I got another somewhere else...

that'll grow...

Did you get it?
They got it!

I'm tired of hearing that most
NASCAR fans drink too much.

Cos it's not true?
Oh no, it's true...

I'm just tired of hearing it.

Makes me thirsty for another beer

Besides beer, do you ever have wine at the track?
Yeah, but we have boxed wine...

Yeah, it's wine that comes in a box

It's great, cos if you had too much to drink,
then you got something to throw up in.

Bubba J, don't you
worry about your health?

Huh?
Your health...

Like what?
Your liver...

No

My last abduction
with the aliens took it.

You think you got abducted by aliens?
I don't think, I know!!!

They took me and they
stuck something in my butt.

And not in the good way...

When you go to a NASCAR race
and you party a lot,

who is your designated driver?

What the fuck is that?

Do you drive drunk?
No officer!!

I'm practising

Have you ever had an intervention?
Yeah, and penicillin cleared her right of him

Stupid cousin

It was a second cousin!

That's a grey area

Do you play any sports yourself?
Does 'QUARTERS' count?

No

Do you got a drinking problem?
No, I pretty much got it figured out

What's your favorite beer?
An open one

And how do you know when you had too much?
I run out

Have you ever been to an
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?

A.A. is for quiters

He, Mister Dunham, I was wondering...
What is it that you do for a living?

I'm a comedian
You are?

You got one of them catch frases?
Well you know I'm a ventriloquist

Oh, you don't eat meat?

What?

Bubba J, are you married?
Oh yeah

Is your wife pretty?
Yeah...

No

What's the difference?
The light.

Where did you meet your wife?
At the family reunion.

What?!

Where was this family reunion?
At the state fair.

Why don't you tell us about
the first time you saw your wife?

Alright

There she was...

More?
Yeah, more!

Where was she?
She was leaning against the ferris wheel..

Making it tilt...

Sunlight, glistening off her curlers...

Corndog in one hand,
a Budweiser in the other.

My tattoo is growing!!

I went up to her and I said:
"Young woman, you look more delicious

then mayonnaise oozing
out of a spam sandwich."

And then she smiled...

What a tooth!

So I guess you dated her a little while?
Yeah, a little bit

Then you proposed?
No her daddy did that for me

How did that happen?
I was supposed to come and pick her up about 7 o'clock

One night, I got there at 7.30h

And her daddy was on the front
porch with his shotgun. He said:

"He Bubba J, guess who else is late!"

I'm glad you're laughing,
somebody had to explain it to me.

I still don't get it

So I guess you had the wedding at the church?
Yeah

Had the reception?
At Wal-Mart

Wal-Mart?
Yeah

Why?
Easier to return the gifts

We walked in the front door, some old
conger standing there and he goes:

He, welcome to Wal-Mart,
get you shit and get out!

Say goodnight Bubba J.
Goodnight!

I met this next guy many years ago,
also when I was in college.

He is not from the United States.
He's from a small micronesian island in the South-Pacific.

And he hopped a cruise ship,
I actually met him down in Florida.

We met up, talked a little bit, I thought he was kinda funny.
We went on stage together a few times.

He's been in my act ever since.
Please help me welcome my buddy: Peanut.

How are you doing Peanut?
I'm doing pretty good. How are you?

I'm fine
That's good, that's goood, that's gooood!

Well, looks like a pretty good crowd tonight
You like it here?

Oh, I love coming here to uh, uh, uh....

This town right here!!

Which town?
This one

Which is?
The one we're in right now...

Peanut, where are we?

You don't know??

I don't think you know
I forgot

You forgot?
We go to see so damn many places, I forgot!

Think about it for a second
Alright, alright, alright...

Damn!!!

The drive from the valley
Was bad as hell...

Traffic?
Sucked like hell...

Drivers?
Angry as hell...

And you?
Were scared as hell...

Parking here?
Sucked more like hell...

So?
We're in hell!!

And these are our hellmates!

Think about it, next time somebody
tells you to go to hell: "Come right here!"

Where are we?
I don't know!

Help me out,

Sorry

I wrote it down for you
Oh good, you wrote it down!

Ah yes! I love coming to...

Sa Nata A Na.

What is it a friggin Indian reservation?!
What the hell?!

Sa Nata A Na.

It's Santa Ana.
"Santa Ana".

Look I know I didn't finish school,
but that friggin says: "Sa Nata A Na".

Dumbass

I will never blink

They pronounce it: "Santa Ana".
Well, they're wrong!

Sa Nata A Na.

It's Santa Ana!
Are you sure?

Yeah
Ok!

You're happy to be here?
What?

You're happy to be here?
Ohh, yes I am...

Just last week, I was lying in bed
and I woke up sobbing.

I will never be happy untill we return to...

Sa Nata A Na!

And now, we're here!!

Thank you for bringing me!

It's a fine city
Ok!

And we're in a very nice theater
Ok!

This town is great

It's a fine city!

Have you looked around?!

Holy crap!

It sucks!

A lot of history in this city.
Translated: "Old as shit".

They've been rejuvenating, refurbishing...

Polish a turd,
it's still a turd

It's a fine city
Ok!

Sorry!

But the drive down here did suck
Yes it did

It was in the 4 or 5 then the 5, holy crap!

Thank goodness we turned on the radio
and listened to the traffic report

How much good did that do us?
None what so friggin ever!

I hate the traffic reports.
They are a waste of time.

Let me do the traffic reports,
I'll save everyone a lot of time and money.

"He Peanut, it's eight o'clock in the morning,
there's a lot of traffic out there. What's going on?"

"IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING!

Everyone left the house
at the same damn time

Back to you!

Call me back at 5.30,
I'll tell you the same thing

Only guess what?
THEY ARE GOING THE OTHER WAY!

You know what else pissed me off today?
Try using my cell phone

Having trouble?
Just like the stinkin commercials

"Can you hear me know? How bout now?
Or now? Now?"

You know what you don't hear in those commercials?
The other end of the conversation!

What a piece of shit!

You know what cellphone sex is?
"Can you feel me now? How bout now?"

Stop it!

This guy is not getting any of this. I've been
watching him the whole time and it's all going...

I'm just kidding buddy.
What's your name?

WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

I'm fucking looking right at ya!

Aren't I?
I think so

Fix my eyes asswhole

It's hard to talk to somebody if
you're not looking right at them.

It's like trying to talk to somebody who has a lazy eye.
You don't know which eye to focus on.

You're sitting there talking to them thinking:
"Oh crap, should I be looking at that eye or that eye?"

Focus you morron!

What?!

What if someone here has a lazy eye?
I'll confuse them. Here I am. Here!

You know what pesto is?
Pesto is the stuff that goes on salades and pizza.

No, Pesto. It's a magician with a harelip.
Pesto!

What if somebody here has a harelip?
Sorry!

Oh stop it!

Boy, what if they had a harelip and a lazy eye. Their really gone be: "Fissed off"

Back to you dude

I'm kidding. You right here with
the blond hair and the glasses.

What is your first name?
Terry.

Terry!

What do you do for a living, Terry?

 I'm a business analyst
A business analyst

Fascinating

How the hell does that work?
Go to a business and go:

"You are in business"

So where were we before this?
Before this, we were in D.C.

Ah yes, Washington D.C.

Doing a show in a theater.
A lovely theater.

About 5 minutes in the show,
I happen to look down.

Back where you're sitting dude, there was a guy.
Sitting right there where you are,

but he was facing THAT way.

And everytime I said something,
the guy went:

And I go: "Hey buddy, what are you doing?"
and the guy goes:

It was a signer.
A SIG NER

Think about this for a second...
They brought a bunch of deaf people to see a ventriloquist!

WHAT?!

What's do you do next? Go take on the
blind folks to see David Copperfield.

"The elephant disappeared"

"It just fucking disappeared"

Oh my god, he's juggling now!
You should see...Oh, sorry!

What the hell were they thinking?

And as the show went on, this guy started to piss me off.
I've never actually seen myself talk before:

So now I thought: Ok I'm gonna get even with this guy
and suddenly in the middle of the show, I went:

"He, stopsign, thank you, turn around, doing doing,
horseshoe, turtle, ughadigadigadiga."

And this poor bastard
is just signing away

All the deaf folks are like:

"What the hell is going on?"

"Our guy sucks"

And then the really screwed thing...
The guy went:

Off course, now he's just sitting there

All deaf folks are like:

"Come on!

What are we missing?!"

Sad part is...
This is all completely true.

We're going to hell, aren't we!?

Hop, here we are!

Oh check it out!
Look, look, look, look

Are you ready?
Si señor

There's something the new folks don't know.

I think you just have to apologize.
Alright, alright, alright

"Look, I can talk without moving my lips!"

You should get drunk and go to a strip joint
Why?

You would be throwing your voice
in places it should neeever come from

Some girl comes dancing up to the table
and everybody hears:

"Let me out!
