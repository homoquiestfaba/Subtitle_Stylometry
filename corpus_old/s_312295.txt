I love this place, I really do.

It's a great place to hang your hat,
or lift your leg.

It's so me!

The bay breeze, the GoIden Gate,
Fisherman's Wharf,..

..the femaIes...

Yeah, don't even get this dog
started on the femaIes!

Just something about the way
a girI sips her Iatte..

..that gets me
a IittIe hot under the coIIar.

But enough about me.
Let's taIk about why we're here:

..the DoIittIes.

Maya DoIittIe is not the doctor,
the daughter.

You see, she's adjusting.

She's going through
that weird period..

..that every
one-in-a-triIIion girIs go through.

It's not every day
a young woman wakes up..

..and reaIizes she can taIk
to animaIs, and we can taIk to her.

I thought you said
you actuaIIy had your Iicense?

Just chiII out!
Everything's under controI now.

Just don't kiII me
before the party tomorrow night!

I burned the dopest CD
for everyone to freak to.

Oh, my God, I just had
the best idea. - What?

You shouId totaIIy have a birthday
party at the end of summer,..

..and we'II make sure
it's off the chain,..

..and then you'II be part
of the ''A'' Iist with me!

I don't know how to teII you this,
but you've been more of a ''B'' IateIy.

Which wouId make me a ''C'' at best.

I am so hating
my sociaI status right now!

What do you expect? Running around
taIking to animaIs aII the time?

I toId you a miIIion times:

..I don't taIk to them,
they keep taIking to me!

Maya, watch out!
Oh, no!

What are you doing?!

What did you do that for, Iady?
I was gonna pee on that!

How bad?

Oh, no!

You drive Iike a freaking animaI!

Are you nuts?
You can get peopIe kiIIed Iike that!

Don't teII it to me,
teII it to the pig!

So I taIked to Heather,
who text-messaged Mandy,..

..who IM'd Christy,
who two-way'd with Tammy,..

..and the bottom Iine is we're both
invited to the party tonight!

Oh, my, God! You're the best!

So then I invited them
to your party at the end of summer.

You did what?
I didn't want to be rude.

Rude?

Rude is inviting somebody to a party
that doesn't even exist yet!

Look, do you want to be in or not?

So... Maya.

I hear you're having
a birthday party this summer...

Yes, and it wouId be so cooI
if aII of you guys came. I mean....

I assume you're having it
somewhere worthwhiIe?

I don't reaIIy know yet, but....
It's on a boat.

Like, on a rowboat?

ActuaIIy, it's on a huge,
P. Diddy-Iike boat.

How MTV of you!
We'II think about it.

A birthday party.
That is so freshman year!

They're so coming, I can feeI it!

You ready? We've got to go.
We got to heIp set up for Senior Day.

20 minutes, peopIe!

Hey, dude!
You roIIing to the jump off tonight?

It's gonna be off the hook.
Hi, CarI.

He nodded at me, did you see that?

Keep it up,
and he might actuaIIy taIk to you.

Nice shot,
you freaking moron!

Give the bird a break, dude!

What's with you
and that dumb thing?

I just feeI bad for him,
being Iocked up in a cage...

How do you feeI so bad for him?

How? The onIy person who has
the combination is PrincipaI Thomas.

Aw, jeez, it's 8-1 5-27!

Hey, guys,
maybe you shouId try 8-1 5-27.

Great!

The freak that taIks to animaIs.
Wait, Iet me guess:

..the hawk toId you the combo?

So, what if he did? You don't have
to be a jerk about it.

Go ahead then, CarI.
Let the bird out, I dare you.

AIright! Shake a taiI feather!

Oh, thanks a Iot, paI.
I'II be right back.

Ladies and gentIemen,
the hawk has Ieft the buiIding!

Sweet.
I owe you one.

There is Maya DoIittIe!

Anybody who is anybody
is gonna be there.

I even heard CarI caII it
''the party of the year''.

Parties? Ooh-Ia-Ia!
I Iove parties!

I'm sure you do.

Now...
Ooh, it's that kind of party!

TeII me where it hurts.
Okay, I'm ready.

So is the party
in the neighborhood?

CooI! Now I can see in coIor!

Oh, yes, definiteIy.
What do you think, Lucky?

I was thinking something,
you know, furrier.

I'm serious.
This party is as big as it gets.

You Iook great, kid!

We were Iistening to that!

I just got off the phone
with your principaI..

..and I saw
what you did to my car.

SmeIIs Iike troubIe...

Sounds Iike you had
an interesting afternoon.

Yeah, but it wasn't my fauIt.

I was trying to impress CarI,
and there was this bird...

I was 1 7 once, too, Maya.
I know what you're going through.

ReaIIy?
So animaIs chattered at you 24-7?

No, but I do know
what it's Iike to want to fit in.

Good. Then you know why I have
to finish getting ready for the party.

I'm sorry, sweetie,..

..but I think
you have earned yourseIf a night in.

But I thought you understood!

I've been working on this Iook
for hours!

Any Ionger,
I wouId've peed on the bed.

It's just one night.

But why does it have to be tonight?

''Where's Maya?'',
''Oh, she's at home, grounded!''

I might as weII teII everybody
you put me in a time-out.

I'm sure there'II be other parties.

Lucky, I need a favor.

Give me a bone and a beIIy rub,
and I'm your man.

Look, we were Iucky
even to get invited, right?

So I think the best approach
in a case Iike this is just..

..to keep a Iow profiIe.
DefiniteIy, Iow pro aII the way.

Let's get
this party started, peopIe!

Sorry.
I guess I got a IittIe carried away.

We'II be Iucky if anybody
even taIks to us after that!

Speak for yourseIf, girIfriend!

I just wanted to say thanks
for taking the rap for me earIier.

PIease, it was...
totaIIy my pIeasure.

CooI. So you wanna dance?

Come on!

Charisse is fine, but I'm getting
reaIIy worried about Maya, John.

I know you had troubIe at first,
but you were a grown man.

Maya's a 1 7-year-oId girI
trying to figure Iife out.

You know what?
I think I might have an idea.

I'm gonna taIk to her
about it right now.

Maya, come down!

Hey, Maya, if you won't sing,
at Ieast come down and dance.

Viv! Low pro, remember?

Oh, forget that!
You're the best dancer here.

Step up, girI!

Come on, Maya, Iet's go!

What a doofus, and it's her wig!

Hey, girI!

Is that CarI and Maya DoIittIe?
Sure, he is.

What are you doing with her?

GirI, I'm grooving!

He must be out of his mind!

Hey, Justin,
turn around, check her out!

That dance is sick!

These moves are tight!

She's pretty good!

I toId you, girI!

Dr. Maya!
My butt is ready to rock and roII!

Let's get this party started,
peopIe!

Bombs away!

What the...?
Fire in the hoIe!

Look out beIow!
Is it haiIing? - I'm so bad!

Oh, no!
What is he doing here?

I'm popping, I'm Iocking,
I'm popping, I'm Iocking.

Go away! Get out of here! Shoo!

It's time to get my freak on.

Why are you doing this to me?
You'II ruin everything. Leave me aIone!

What?

We were just foIIowing you.

Here I come.
Monkey on the move!

Time to meet some Iadies!

This way to the bar, girIs!
It's Iadies night!

Is that what I think it is?

Check it out!
It's imported from France.

You spiked the punch?
Don't worry, it's good stuff.

Wait! Is Maya taIking to it?
Oh, no. - Who brought her anyway?

Has anyone seen my CD?

Au revoir, party poopers!

Come on, CarI, Iet's dance.

Look, just Ieave now,
and I won't teII....

Oh, no, where'd you go?

#AIIons, enfants de Ia patrie,
Ie jour de gIoire est arriv√©!#

The monkey gave it to you...

You reaIIy expect me
to beIieve that?

The monkey from dad's cIinic
foIIowed me to the party, and....

Oh, the party
that you snuck out to attend?

WeII, yeah,
but it wasn't my fauIt!

Then whose fauIt is it?
This ought to be good.

I toId you,
it was the monkey's.

Oh, the monkey, the hawk, the dog!

The dog?
I wasn't even there! The dog...

God, do you ever shut up?

Don't hate the pIayer, girI,
hate the game!

You see, that's the probIem:

..I'm aIways taIking to animaIs, Mom.
I need them to stop.

No, you need to stop.

I think maybe you need
to start thinking seriousIy..

..about who you reaIIy are,..

..and what your future
has in store for you.

Okay, weII...

I guess I can take a coupIe
of weeks off from the cIinic,..

..just to get my head together.

Maybe go down to the beach,
and do some shopping with Viv.

The beach? I couId use a tan.

I'm taIking
about a compIete break,..

..a totaI change of scenery.

There's this camp,
a ranch, actuaIIy,..

..that I went to when I was younger.
Wait! A ranch?

Yeah, that's a good one, Mom,..

..but you and I both know
I'm not a ranch kind of girI.

I think this couId be
a reaIIy good thing for you.

Mom, you were not me!

Oh, God, Mom!
You're sending me away?

To a ranch, with animaIs?
What are you thinking?

Maya, you Iove animaIs.

Okay, Mom, just Iisten to me
for one second.

I was aImost ''B'' crowd once,..

..then I start taIking to animaIs,
and I went straight to a ''C''.

Now I'd just be happy
being back to ''B'' minus,..

..Iike the swim team peopIe.
Or the chess cIub even.

I'm sorry, sweetie,
I'm trying to heIp you.

But you're punishing me
for something I can't controI.

I'm not punishing you.

You have a gift,
and you need to Iearn to accept it.

I'd rather return it.
I want to taIk to daddy.

I aIready did.
He thinks it's a great idea.

WeII, you'd better get some sIeep,
because the bus Ieaves at noon.

Wait, I'm Ieaving tomorrow?
Durango is a great pIace.

You're going to thank me one day.

No, I won't!
Mom, I just want to be normaI!

I wish I wasn't a DoIittIe...

Mom, I'm serious! I'm not going!

A ranch? What wouId I even wear?
Oh, my God, my hair!

I think I just went straight
from a ''C'' to an ''F''.

''F'' is good.
''F'' is the new ''B''.

Mom, I can't beIieve
I Iet you taIk me into this!

Just give it a chance, honey.
I promise, one day....

Yes, I know,
one day I'II thank you.

Just do your best
to have a good time..

..and everything
is going to work itseIf out.

Go.

I don't know if I can do this.
Sure you can! Just do what I do.

And what is that?
Drink out of the toiIet bowI?

No, I take it one day at a time.

Yeah, thanks for the advice,
Dr. PhiI!

Stay off my bed whiIe I'm gone.
Oh, you can count on me.

Not...

Not...

What happened?
You miss the bus to the maII?

Yeah, but that was onIy because
I was trying to figure out..

..how much make-up we were
going to need for your makeover.

Okay,
it's going to be Iike that, huh?

Hey, you're the one
messing with me?

Ladies, Iadies! Come on, now.
CaIm down! Papa's here, aIright?

We don't need to argue,
where's Iove?

Sorry, dude.
Didn't mean to do that.

It's a big bag, isn't it?
Yeah... it's not the onIy thing!

Coming through. Excuse me,
these are big bags. Watch out.

Oh, come on!

Anybody wants some Off?
Some back off is more Iike it.

What? It's good to be prepared.
Prepared for what? MaIaria?

Come on,
I've got donuts here.

D-nut? D-nut?
Want a donut? D-nut?

Ah, cooI.

How about you? You want one?
No.

Whoopsie daisy.

Five second ruIe's stiII in effect.

This is gonna be one Iong summer...

What's the matter?
You homesick aIready?

What's your probIem?
You don't even know me!

No, and I don't need
to know you either, okay?

I can spot your type a miIe away.
Hey, hey!

Let's pIay the quiet game, huh?

Winner gets a date with yours truIy?

ShouIdn't you be, Iike,
at fat camp or something?

Look, my bones are Iarge.
AIright?

Whatever heIps you sIeep at night!

Wow, this is gorgeous!

That's SiIver Spurs, another ranch.
Your ranch is over there.

Oh, no!

Yeah! FinaIIy we're here!

Excuses-moi!

Something stinks!

Okay, cIearIy,
there's been a mistake.

I said ''A Iist'' not ''hay Iist''.

HeIIo? Mom, are you there?

Mom, are you there? Pick up!
Maya!

Come on, pick up, it's me!

Maya, I'm coming.
Just hang on, just keep yapping.

It's awfuI out here...

CaII me
whenever you get this message.

I need you to come pick me up.
Maya, Maya!

Where's that freaking button?

I reaIIy need to Iearn how to read!
Okay, bye...

I've got to get out of here.

Easy! - You princess,
what are you Iooking at over there?

On second thought, maybe this pIace
isn't so bad after aII.

That's the onIy smart thing
you've said aII day.

Who are you?!

I'II be back to you Iater.

The crapper...
Oh, I just stepped on something!

Howdy!
WeIcome to Durango. I'm Bo.

Wow, Bo! That was amazing
what you did with that horse!

Do you, Iike,
work here or something?

I guess you can say that.
My dad owns this pIace.

CooI!

The first thing is get you guys
unpacked, and you can go ahead and....

You have amazing eyes!

Thank you, that's...
mighty kind of you to say that.

Oh, no, pIease teII me
I didn't just say that out Ioud!

Don't worry.
I won't even hoId it against you.

By the way,
I didn't catch your name.

I'm BrookIyn. BrookIyn Webster.

Okay, BrookIyn Webster.
How you doing?

I'm... doing much better now!

I'm Maya. Maya Do --

DoIores.
Maya DoIores Hanes.

Maya DoIores Hanes...

That's an interesting name
right there.

Not reaIIy. Just your simpIe,
PIain Jane kind of Iast name.

Nothing reaIIy speciaI about it.

I reaIIy Iike those chaps on you.
Those Iook... fantastic!

And I Iove your hat.
It makes us Iook Iike we're twins!

They're Iike moths to a fIame!

You know, it's very nice
to meet both of you Iadies.

It's nice to meet aII of you, guys.

The first thing we need to do
is get everybody unpacked,..

..and get you guys aII settIed in,
aIright? - Okay.

Come on, everybody,..

..I'm going to show you
aII to the bunkhouse,..

..and then we can aII get started
on some ranching chores. - SweII!

I want the bed with the window!

Oh, what a dump!

Were you expecting the Four Seasons,
or something?

Okay, did I do something specific
or are you aIways such a....

Oh, I'm sorry, did I hurt
your IittIe Miss Priss feeIings?

No, seriousIy,
do you aIways act Iike this?

OnIy when I see something I want.

And right now, I want Bo.

So you need to back off, okay?

Thank you!

Hey, Jud. I got those animaIs
Ioaded up and ready to go.

Okay, WaIt.

I sure appreciate you taking
that Iivestock off my hands.

That's what neighbors are for.

Despite aIways whipping
your butt at the rodeo,..

..the SiIver Spurs has aIways
considered the Durango an oId friend.

Now, if there's
anything eIse I can do,..

..you just Iet me know.

I've aIways got my eyes open
for some good Iand.

I'm sure you do.

WeII, WaIt,
if you'II excuse me,..

..I got some new recruits up there
waiting on me.

You take care, Jud.
You do the same, WaIter.

Goatsies, goatsies!

What are you Iooking at,
fat boy?

SiIIy pigs.

Why, you want a piece of me,
pork chop?

Do I Iook funny to you, huh?

What? I got a boog?

I get it?

Gone? You hungry?

Hey, where you going?
I ain't finished with you!

I'II see you at the buffet tabIe!

Hey, gang, I'm Jud Jones.
WeIcome to Durango.

I imagine most of you
aIready met my son Bo, here.

We're going to be working hard here
at Durango for the next six weeks,..

..getting you aII ready
to ride in the IocaI rodeo,..

..and anyone
that trains hard enough..

..can take a shot
at the individuaI competition,..

..and who knows? You might get
to win a nice, big shiny trophy.

WouIdn't it be easier if we just
watched it on TV? - Shut up!

So we're not going
to be competing as a team?

No, son.
I'm afraid that the Durango ranch..

..doesn't enter into the team
portion of the competition.

How come?

Let's say it's hard to expect
a bunch of city foIk..

..to compete
against experienced cowboys.

But who's ready to become
a cowboy in training? - Me!

And they caII me weird!

Are you going to teach the buII ride?
That's the cooIest.

Come on, gang!

The best cowboy is no match
for the right buII on a bad day.

But... you don't expect us
to do that other stuff, right?

Oh, no, not today.

Today, you're going to take
yourseIf a nice IeisureIy traiI ride.

And tomorrow?

Tomorrow, IittIe Iady,
the reaI work begins. - Can't wait.

Okay, Red.
Let's see what you got.

Okay, I can do this.

Man, TyIer, you are a wuss!

Here, Iet me show you, guys,
how it's done, okay? Watch this.

Let me show you how it's done.

You couId use a bath around here!

Watch this, guys.

One at a time!
Why do I aIways get the fat kid?

ShouIdn't have had
that third Snickers.

Don't worry, kid.
She'II move when the time's right.

WeII, Iooks Iike you're up, Maya!

What's the matter, princess?
You scared you might break a naiI?

No. I've just never done
something Iike this before.

I think I'II try it Iater.
Never is more Iike it.

And the princess goes down!

Are you okay?
Yeah.

You've got to get on her
from this side.

Don't worry, she's pretty oId.
She doesn't move Iike she used to.

OId? I got you oId, buddy!

No, no, no! Wait!
Oh, no, no. - No, no!

Oh, my God!

Move, Bo!
HeIp!

Come on, son, move!

I thought I was off to a bad start.

Come on!

Whatever's your name, stop it!
Stop it, sIow down.

Who's the oId one now, huh?
HeIp me!

Hang on, Maya!
HoId back on the race!

You aIright?

That's good.

Let's see if we can get you
on this thing the right way!

There you go.
See, there? NaturaI born rider.

Any day, DoIores.

Hey, Bo, thanks..

..and maybe Iater you can show me
how to do aII this on my own.

''Maybe next time you can show me
how to do it on my own.''

You don't actuaIIy think
that crap's going to work, do you?

I'm sorry, I beIieve the phrase is,
''Don't hate the pIayer, hate the game''.

Game on! You got served!

Goodbye!

If you think I'm dirty,
you shouId see my pen!

Hey, I sIeep on my own crap!
You shut up!

Have you seen Cogburn IateIy?
No, you shut up!

He's not the head of the hen house.

Hey, pig, what are you doing?

AIright, I got one, check this out.

What do you caII
three cows sitting in a jacuzzi?

Stew!

Do you animaIs ever stop?

What is your probIem?

Was I taIking in my sIeep again?

I tend to do that. Sorry.

You are such a weirdo.
27, 28, 29...

Shut up!

Hey, what comes after 29?

I knew.

Oh, I don't even know why I bother.

Hey, just wake up if you want!
What do I care?

What a joke! When is Jud going
to reaIize we girIs have our needs?

WouId it kiII the man to get
a rooster with a IittIe chutzpah?

Cock-a-doodIe-do!
SIeeping UgIy!

Oh, no!

You okay?

I guess you weren't kidding
about bright and earIy, huh?

Dad Iikes
to get a head start on the sun.

So I'd say you got
about 10 minutes tiII we get going.

Okay.

AIright.

So anyways,..

..I finaIIy reaIized hitchhiking
is impossibIe without a thumb!

So I hopped on the back
of a pickup truck, and here I am.

Oh, no. No way! It can't be!
You aII be good now, you hear?

Hey, Maya!
Look who's gone country!

Hey, there, IittIe feIIow!
Aren't you the cutest IittIe thing?

What's with the baby taIk, Maya?
I can hear you, remember?

Which is why you need to get
out of here. Now, go on, scram!

But I heard your message.
I came here to rescue you.

I'm serious.
You cannot stay here!

If the kids find out
I'm a DoIittIe, I'm....

But you are a DoIittIe,
aren't you?

Of course I'm a DoIittIe.

OnIy right now,
I'm a DoIittIe who's fitting in.

If the animaIs find out
I can taIk to them, I'm doomed!

Why? You Iove animaIs.

Of course I Iove animaIs.

It's just that if they taIk to me,
I'm going to taIk back,..

..and if I taIk back, the kids
wiII think I'm some kind of freak.

You can stay here if you want,..

..but just find something
to occupy your time.

Occupy my time! Copy that.
Okay.

This doesn't have anything to do
with the cowboy behind you, does it?

You mean the reaIIy cute one?

He's... behind me?

Hey!

Are you taIking to that stray dog?

They Iike it for you to taIk
to them Iike they're peopIe,..

..because it makes them
feeI important.

Yeah...
So Iet me get this straight.

I come aII the way here
and now you're just going to ignore me?

But I wore a wig!

Do you have any idea how confusing
that can be to a dog's identity?

Go round them up,
get them together.

AIright, Durangos!
Let's go, everybody!

Durangos! Let's go! On the doubIe!
Let's go! On the doubIe!

Round up! Round up!

Okay, yesterday
you aII got your feet wet.

Today you're going swimming.

There's a pooI? Sweet!

It's a metaphor, you moron!

WeII, Iike I was saying,..

..it's time to find out
what you kids are made of.

So Bo and the boys have buiIt
a coupIe of contraptions..

..to simuIate what an actuaI rodeo
might be Iike.

So remember:
have fun out there!

You got 'em, son.
AIright, Pops.

Let's just head on over this way.
CooI.

Nice shorts, CIayton!

What, I'm a Iover,
not a fighter!

Let's go.
Nice IittIe brisk run here, come on!

Left, Ieft, Ieft, right, Ieft...

Who's the one taIking smack now?
Huh, fat boy?

Come on! Nay!

Come on! You don't reaIIy think
you can catch me, do you?

So cIose, yet so fat.

Left, Ieft, Ieft, right, Ieft.

Oh! Left, Ieft, Ieft, right, Ieft.
Left, Ieft, Ieft, right....

Poop it out!
Come on, poop it out!

Hey! - Poop it!
That's a rooster!

I'd wash your hands.

AIright, Iet's grub!
FinaIIy something I'm good at!

Maya! Maya, over here!

It's important. PIease!

It's better be good.

WeII, you see, the thing is this...
I....

Oh, no, I know that face.
What did you do?

I... may or may not
have sIipped up..

..and toId one or two
of the animaIs who you were.

What?
Thanks for seIIing me up the river!

Hey, take it easy!
I didn't know what eIse to say..

..when they asked me
what I was doing here.

It's fine.

Wait! You're sure
it was just one or two, right?

Yeah, pretty sure...

And then again
it couId have been..

..aII of them.

I think that's her.

You are so dead when we go home!

Hey, whatever
the man's best friend thinks, huh?

Humans...

Morning, Miss DoIittIe!
Hey!

Oh!

I don't want to ruffIe any feathers,
Miss DoIittIe, but I've got a probIem.

I knew this was gonna happen.

Hey, Maya! Excuse me, girI,..

..there's something
I need to taIk to you about.

Something reaIIy important.
Gracie, whatever it is,..

..I'm sure
you can work it out on your own.

But if you don't mind,
I rather be Ieft aIone, okay?

HeIIo, heIIo!
Okey-dokey! Lob one?

Hey, sIow down there, sexy!

Around here, that egg
is considered a coIIector's item!

Look who it is.
Hey, Iadies, what's cracking?

The IittIe rooster who couIdn't.

SeriousIy, Iike Iow egg production
is my fauIt.

You're not heIping anything
by mocking me, you know?

TaIk about
a cock-a-doodIe-don't!

That's very funny!

Hey, watch it!
You watch it, Iady!

I had a reaIIy bad day
so far, aIright?

But if you wanna dance,
Iet's dance!

Hey! What is wrong with you?

''Oh, be a rooster!'', they say.

''Show us what you're made of'',
they say.

They think it's easy
being the onIy rooster..

..on a farm fuII of hens?
WeII, it's not!

I'm sorry, Iook...
I'm just under a Iot of pressure.

I just wish there was someone
I couId taIk to...

I'm sure everything's
going to be okay.

Hey, you just taIked to me!

You mean none
of the other animaIs taIk to you?

WeII, I've been
in kind of a funk IateIy.

I haven't been out
of the coop in days.

WeII, just give it
a IittIe bit of time.

I'm sure everything wiII work out.

Hey, peopIe fight.
PeopIe fight!

Don't just stand there!
HeIp us!

Give me a ten-spot
on the tough one.

Hey!
What? Just pIaying the odds.

Disgusting!
Go ahead! Pick on the skinny guy!

What has gotten into you, kids?

I was pIanning to seII those eggs
this afternoon!

Come on, Pops!
They're just having a IittIe fun.

It's Iike that, huh?

AIright, then.

So..

..what do you women want exactIy?
I mean, a guy can do so much....

Sorry, Cogburn, but taIking to you
earIier aImost got me busted. - But....

Now, Ieave me aIone
before somebody sees.

But what good is taIking to animaIs..

..if you can't heIp a brother out?!
Hey, come back!

Hey, stiII ignoring me?

What do you think?

Sheesh!
I never knew you were such a snob!

A snob? What?
I am so not a snob!

I'm just doing my best
to try to fit in, that's aII.

PIus, I reaIIy think
Bo is starting to Iike me.

He Iikes you?
Who you're pretending to be?

Can't you see that just for once
I want to be normaI?

But you're not normaI, Maya.
You're a DoIittIe.

Yeah, not out here, I'm not.

I just hate not taIking to you.
You're my best friend.

I'm sorry. I know I shouIdn't
be taking any of this out on you.

I know you're just trying to heIp.

About time you gave the dog
his due!

And I guess it's okay
if aII the animaIs know,..

..but we have to make sure
no peopIe find out.

You think I'm going to teII them?
If you couId, yeah!

Wait!
Where have you been aII morning?

You know,
just different things...

I Iove it here...

The wide open spaces,
and the straw...

Yeah, you met the coIIie,
haven't you?

Yeah... she is smoking!

Come on!

Oh, forget it, Bo!
You can't break him.

Besides, we need the money.

Wait,
you're gonna seII him? Why?

Pretty as he is, he ain't no use to us
if he won't Iet nobody ride him.

What's his name?

He doesn't have one.
Maybe you shouId name him.

I wouIdn't even know where to begin.

The name's Butch.
You must be Maya.

How about Butch?

Why Butch?

My mama gave me that name.
You got a probIem with that, cowboy?

I don't know. Maybe he just...
Iooks Iike a Butch to me.

AIright. Then Butch it is.

You think
you couId do something for me?

I got this rock in my shoe.
It's been driving me nuts aII day.

I'd Iove to.

Let's see.

Come on! Up, Butch!

Ah! Thanks, kid.
I guess I owe you one.

No probIem!

But why won't you just
Iet them break you?

I'm a staIIion, sweetheart,..

..and staIIions
don't break that easy.

You know if they can't break you,
they're going to seII you.

If they're gonna seII me anyway,
I might as weII go down swinging.

What do you mean
''if they're gonna seII you anyway''?

Look around, kid.

Jud's been seIIing off animaIs
for weeks.

The pIace is starting to Iook
Iike a ghost town.

That's so sad.
TeII me about it!

Hey, Pops.

Ain't that the darndest thing?
Look at that!

The staIIion
actuaIIy Iet her touch him.

You went off to coIIege for a year
and you stiII haven't figured out..

..that there's more to a woman
than just a pretty smiIe?

StiII Iearning, Pops.
Every day, son!

That's pretty impressive
the way you got on with Butch.

You have a Iot of pets at home?
Me?

No! What wouId make you think that?
I mean, I Iove them and everything,..

..if that's what you're asking,
but I wouIdn't say I was an expert.

So what about you?

You seem to be pretty in tune
with them yourseIf.

Let's say I understand them a Iot more
than I understand peopIe.

I mean, especiaIIy you girIs.

You never have to guess
what an animaI is feeIing.

You know, I think that hay
this morning gave me the runs.

UnfortunateIy,
I know exactIy what you mean.

WeII... nice taIking to you.

You too.

Look what we've got here!

The amazing,..

..the wonderfuI... Durangos!

Let's go see these IittIe cats!

Take a good Iook from over there,
Durangos.

That's as cIose
as you're ever going to get,..

..'cause you're not weIcome over here.
Like we care, LittIe Lord FauntIeroy!

Watch it, girI!

What?
You better watch you're mouth....

Hey! Look.
Knock it off, aIright, guys?

Just knock it off.

ShouId probabIy enjoy your summer,
though, Bo.

Looks Iike it's going to be your Iast.

What is that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

Nothing at aII, man.

Let's just go, you aII.
That's right, tuck taiI and run!

Seems to be the onIy thing you
and your dad are good at teaching.

Guess I'II see you Iater!

Come on, boy! Let's get going.

Let's go.
See you Iater, Durangos!

Let's get out of here! Yeah!

CattIe drive, sIeep outside.
Haven't they ever heard of ticks?

The word is that the coIIie's coming.

Hey, you know me.
I Iove working the road.

That's the spirit gang.

See, the more we work together
the better we'II be.

See, ranching's aII about teamwork.

Hear that?
Maybe us two shouId buddy up.

You're not that Iucky.

Shucks!

I Ieft some of the army bIankets
in the gear hut. I'II be back.

No. You stay put. I'II go get them.
Thank you.

Isn't that heIpfuI of you, Maya?

Hey, Jud, that's a safety hazard.

CarefuI! My....

This is gonna be one Iong ride.

Yeah.

I wonder why he never said anything!

Hey, Dad!
Something's going on to you.

Are you going to teII me
or to keep it bottIed up as usuaI?

I know I shouId've toId you sooner,..

..but the bank's going to forecIose
on the pIace in a coupIe of weeks..

..if I don't catch up on the payments.

We'II figure out how to get the money.
We aIways do.

This is the open range, gang.

So far we've been teaching you
individuaI skiIIs.

To get out here, you aII put your skiIIs
together in what we caII ''team work''.

Hey, Jud!

You reaIIy Iike it out here, huh?
I Iove it.

See, Maya, it's days Iike this
that make me understand..

..why the settIers moved West
and risked everything they had.

It was their destiny.

That's one thing
I've come to find out.

You can't fight your destiny, Maya.

No matter how much you think
it might cost you. You can't fight it.

Hey, Pops!
I went aII the way down to the river.

You know over there
by SiIver Spurs?

I spotted a herd,..

..just down the way up here,
about haIf a miIe.

Okay.
Gang, now Iisten up!

Now me and Bo wiII do
most of the cutting,..

..but you kids feeI free to jump
in any time you want, okay? - Okay.

Go ahead, Bo, Iead on.
Awesome!

Come aIong!

Durango, Iet's go!

I'm gonna miss
this pIace, too, girI!

Come on, buddy! Let's go!

Can I take a picture?
I want to show it to mom.

Hey! If I get you, boy!

You're not going to take my candy!

AIright, stampede!

He got him!

Hey, get your own candy!

Note to seIf:
don't steaI candy from fat kids.

Oh, my God!

ReIax, now, sweetheart.
Nobody eIse move a muscIe.

Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

No, you're not!
Nobody's gonna die on my watch, baby.

Besides, his bark
is a Iot worse than his bite.

What the...?

Look at TyIer, wiII you?
WiII you Iook at him?

Way to go, boy!

I did it!

You ever danced with the deviI
in the paIe moonIight?

Hey, who kiIIed the Iights?

I heard they taste Iike chicken.

Thank you.

Lucky, was that a woIf?
WoIf, shmoIf.

I eat those chumps for breakfast.

Care for a midnight stroII?

Why don't I get inside here
and rescue you?

So how do you Iike it?
The whoIe being-a-cowboy thing?

I wouIdn't know. I mean,..

..I spent the Iast year
as a freshman at PaIo AIto.

ReaIIy?

WeII, PaIo AIto's not that far
from San Francisco.

I've been thinking the same thing.

You see, it's a great night.

''Va vest''.

The best.

That's what I meant to say.

The best.

A cattIe drive! More Iike
a cattIe marathon. Am I right?

There it is!

That's the Bekerman pIace.

It's a beautifuI spread, isn't it?

I never get tired of Iooking at it.

TeII me, Pops! You think they've earned
a night on the town?

Yeah, I reckon.

Don't faII off the horse!

This music's giving me a headache.
Baby, a headache?

I thought we were gonna
sniff each other.

I Iike this pIace.
It's not my usuaI crowd but I Iike it.

Oh, yeah?
So what's your usuaI crowd then?

This might sound a IittIe corny,..

..but I think
I'm just now figuring that out.

Check it out.

Easy, fat boy! Isn't there
some kind of weight Iimit here?

You break it, you buy it.

You aren't thinking
what I think you're thinking.

There's a time in every man's Iife
when he has to put his foot down..

..and draw a Iine in the sand.

Yeah, but does that have to be here?
Yes. - Against them? - Yes.

AIright.

Light me up!

This is gonna be good!

Boy down!
Look at that!

Move out of the way.
I'm gonna show you how it's done.

Excuse me!

AIright, kids.
Show what you get.

Okay. Why don't I show you Iosers
how a reaI cowboy does it, aIright?

Bring it up a few notches,
Iet me show off.

Take a Iook, Durango!

Care to take a shot at the titIe?
Or are you stiII a has-been, Bo?

Durangos, we Ieave in an hour.

An hour? Looks Iike
there's troubIe in paradise!

AIright, don't forget, foIks!

Stings, huh?

#SettIe down, CindereIIa.
Keep it together.#

#Your handsome feIIa
wiII ride up sooner or Iater.#

#Yeah, and take you away,
yeah!#

#SettIe down, CindereIIa,
Iove's gonna find you some day.#

CindereIIa, my butt!
More Iike the eviI step-sister!

What about a tough act to foIIow!
Give it up for Kiki!

AIright!

Guys, somebody's got to step up.

We can't Iet them beat us
in everything.

Hey, don't Iook at me, aIright?
I aIready took my stand.

(The freak that taIks to animaIs.)

(You need to start thinking
about who you reaIIy are.)

(You can't fight your destiny.)

AIright!

Now hoId your horses, everyone!

Looks Iike we got
a Iast minute addition from Durango!

Sure hope
she sings better than I ride!

Not the onIy one.
Hi, everybody.

I know you guys heard of hip-hop,..

..but this is a IittIe something
I Iike to caII ''hick-hop''.

Check it out!

#Sometimes my naiIs
match my Iips and..#

#..my jeans hug my hips.#

#I don't feeI Iike
doing that right now. Listen!#

#He's on his way over.#

I hate to admit it,
but she's pretty good.

#You better Iove me
when my roots are showin'..#

#..or I'II pack up my boots,
be goin'.#

#Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye! Hey!#

#If it's me
that he's impressed with,..#

#..anything I might be dressed in..#

#..ought to be just fine.#

#If he's the one for me,
I'II know it.#

#He better Ioves me
when my roots are showin'.#

#He better Ioves me
when my roots are showin'.#

#Or I'II pack up my boots
and I'II be goin'.#

#If it's me
that he's impressed with,..#

#..anything I'm dressed with..#

#..ought to be just fine.#

#Ought to be just fine...#

#He better Ioves me
when my roots are showin'.#

#Or I'II pack up my boots
and I'II be goin'.#

#Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye! Hey!#

#If it's me
that he's impressed with,..#

#..anything I might be dressed in..#

#..ought to be just fine.#

#If he's the one for me,
I'II know it, I wiII!#

#If he's the one for me,
I'II know it, I wiII!#

#If he's the one for me,
I'II know it!#

#Love me
when my roots are showin'.#

Looks Iike we got a new champion.
Ladies and gentIemen,..

..Maya DoIores Hayes!

I'm sorry, but you're out of time.

You either seII the Iand and what's
Ieft of the Iand to SiIver Spurs..

..or the bank wiII forecIose
and you'II end up with nothing.

Okay, Bo! Bring them aII in.
Let's go everybody.

Jud, you shouId have been with us.
The ride was great!

Oh, that's good!
That's reaIIy good!

There's no easy way to say this,
so I'm going ahead and get it over with.

Looks Iike I'm going
to have to Iet the ranch go.

What?
Got to Iet it go.

You're kidding, right?
I'm afraid not, BrookIyn.

I'm sorry.

This bIows. I don't want to Ieave.

I know. I wish
there was something we couId do.

Let's just get some grub, guys.

I can't beIieve I'm saying this,..

..but I'm not even hungry.

Excuse me, Maya.

Sorry to wake you, but your presence
has been requested in the barn.

Whatever it is, make it quick.

I don't want
anyone to see me out here.

You're the onIy one who can heIp us,
Maya. You are our onIy hope.

I don't know what to teII you, guys.

I can't stop Jud
from seIIing the ranch.

I wish I couId,
but there's nothing I can do.

Maybe the other kids wouId heIp
if you just teII them who you are.

I can't just announce to everybody..

..that the animaIs asked me
to save the ranch.

They'II think I'm crazy.

Don't you mean
''Bo wiII think you're crazy''?

No.

Yeah...

Look, you guys, I can't Iose him.

You're not Iosing anybody.
You're a DoIittIe. They'II understand.

That's the probIem, Butch:
they won't understand.

Other kids never do.

We can't do this without you.
You're our voice, Maya. - Sorry.

DoIittIe?
More Iike ''Donothing''.

Maya,
you've got to teII them the truth.

Woah, Red.

It's getting to be about that time.

Even though we weren't abIe
to finish the summer up properIy,..

..I want everyone of you knows
that I beIieve in everyone of you.

And you aII might be city foIk,..

..but you've got a Iot of taIent,
and you've got a Iot of heart.

That's not too easy to find
in foIks these days.

You aII take care!

We'II see you, Red.
Yeah.

We'II see you, Big FeIIa.
Yeah. - Lay off the burgers here!

Thank you so much.
I had so much fun.

God bIess you.
Thanks.

I'm so sorry, Jud.
Don't you worry, sweetie-pie.

We'II be just fine.

Drive carefuI, son.

Shotgun. I caIIed it.

Man, poor Jud... Did you see the Iook
on his face when we drove off?

Yeah.

I just wish there was something
we couId have done.

Man, this sucks! You guys are Iike
the cooIest friends I've ever had.

''CooIest''? Or ''onIy''?

What?
You know what.

It's time, Maya. Time for you
to be a DoIittIe again.

I know I'm just a dog,
but if they reaIIy are your friends,..

..and if Bo reaIIy cares about you,..

..they'II accept you,
no matter who you are.

But onIy
if you accept yourseIf first!

We need to stop the bus.

Why?

Because I know
how we can save the ranch.

This ought to be good.

We enter the rodeo this weekend,
as a team,..

..and win the 50,000 doIIar prize.

Think about it! CIayton has aIready
proved that he can wrangIe a steer..

..and TyIer has become a pro
at the rope, now.

And BrookIyn can ride circIes
around anybody.

Yeah, but what about the buII ride?
Who's gonna do that?

I saw aII your trophies when I got
the bIankets in the hood.

You were the best buII rider
in the whoIe state.

Maya, it's too IittIe too Iate.
Even if I did ride,..

..the rodeo's this weekend.
We'd never be ready in time.

What if I toId you
we aIso had a secret weapon,..

..something that no other ranch has,
not even SiIver Spurs.

What wouId that be?

Me.

No offense, but I didn't see you
do anything speciaI except sing.

My reaI name
isn't Maya DoIores Hanes.

It's Maya DoIittIe and..

..I can taIk to animaIs.

Right, and I'm the poster boy
for Jenny Craig!

I'm serious, CIayton.
I knew you Iooked famiIiar.

I see your dad
on the news aII the time.

Yes. And I'm sorry
I Iied to you, guys,..

..but I didn't want you to Iook at me
Iike I was freak or something.

The point is
aII the animaIs came to me..

..and they reaIIy
don't wanna be soId.

They Iove Durango as much as we do.

And the way I see it, they can
teII us what we need to do to win.

Do you know what?
That might actuaIIy work.

What the heck? I'm in.
If it's going to heIp Jud out,..

..I'm with you, girI.

Time to cowboy up, everybody!

So what do you think, Bo?

Look, I'm sorry I Iied to you,..

..but it was because I Iiked you.

Out of aII the time we spent together,
the things we said to one another,..

..you wait untiI now to teII me
that you can taIk to animaIs.

Back home
I was considered a weirdo.

That's why
my mom sent me here,..

..so I couId make a fresh start.

It may have taken me a IittIe Ionger
than it shouId have, but....

Wait. If you Iet me finish,
there's something I have to ask you.

Do you have any idea
how cooI that is?

Look, I'II understand if you....

Wait! What did you say?

I said that's about the cooIest thing
that I've ever heard.

I've practicaIIy spent my whoIe Iife
wishing that I couId taIk to animaIs,..

..and you can!

I hate to say I toId you so.

So wait! You're not mad?

Mad? No!
Sweetie, come here.

Now why wouId I be mad?

Other than the fact
that I have to ride..

..a 2000 pound animaI
that wants to kiII me...

I mean, no, I'm not.
I'm cooI.

Come on, we've got a meeting
that we've got to interrupt. - CooI.

AII I need is a signature, Jud.

Here you go, Jud!

You can keep it, if you Iike,
as a souvenir.

Dad, wait! Don't sign anything!

HoId on, tiger. Your daddy's
just about to finish some business.

No, you hoId your horses, WaIter.

Sounds Iike my son
needs to speak to me.

What's going on?
What you aII two doing here?

What brings you aII over here?

Speak up!

I'm not who you think I am, Jud.

I know just who you are,
Miss DoIittIe.

What?
You mean you knew it aII this time?

Why didn't you say anything?

I figured you'd teII us
when you got good and ready.

WeII, I'm ready now.

We aII want to enter the rodeo
as a team and win the prize money.

I can get
aII the animaIs to co-operate..

..if, of course, you don't seII them,
and you... promise to Iet them stay.

Who are we going to get to ride a buII
for 8 second? TeII me that?

Nope.
No, that is not going to happen.

We've been over this
a hundred times before, Bo.

The doctor said if you take one
more faII Iike you did Iast time,..

..you might never waIk again.
No, sir. No.

Not going to happen.
I'm not wiIIing to take that risk.

But I am, okay?
Bo!

It's my Iife and it's my choice.
And I've made it, okay?

I'm not Ietting them
take the ranch from us!

Pops.

I'm gonna get on that buII,..

..and I am not coming off
untiI that beII rings.

I see the gang's aII here.

We can do this, Jud. Together.

As a team.

Just Iike you taught us
at the cattIe drive.

What the hey! At the very Ieast,
it'II put WaIter's shorts in a bunch.

Oh, yes!

GentIemen, it seems
there's been a change of pIans.

I'II see you at the rodeo.

Looks Iike I got myseIf a team.
But, Jud, I mean....

I know my way out.

Move it, BrookIyn!

The onIy thing is gonna hurt you
is the ground!

29 seconds.
Is that good?

The winning time is 1 3.

Wait here a second. I got an idea.

Remember you said you owed me one?
I'm taking you up on that offer!

What do you mean?

You're the biggest
and strongest horse out here.

If we have any shot
of winning the rodeo,..

..we need to Iet BrookIyn and TyIer
ride you in their events.

Me? An untamed staIIion
in a reaI rodeo? I wouId be honored!

Lord, I hope that's mud!

Hey, beefcake!
When you got to go, you got to go!

What's he saying?

He's just giving
a IittIe constructive criticism,..

..but he says you're doing great.

Like that. Can you try?

I think you shouId waIk Iike a man.

WeII, a Iot of good that does me.
I'm a rooster, remember?

Come on, you can do it!

Got it!

Come on, puff that chest out!
Put your shouIders back!

See, you know
what I'm taIking about!

He says: ''Ease up on the reins
and stake back on the saddIe!''.

UntiI he wants to throw, then he
shouId shift his weight forward.

UntiI you want to throw,
then shift your weight forward!

TeII him to speed up!
The cow wants you to speed up!

Forget that!
TeII the stupid caIf to sIow down!

On a personaI note, I wouId think
twice before caIIing a caIf stupid.

Can't argue with you there.

Left, Ieft, Ieft, right, Ieft.

#I don't care
if you think it's true.#

#You'II be cowboys
when you're through!#

#We don't care
if you think it's true.#

#We'II be cowboys
when we're through!#

#I don't care where you've been.
Durango Ranch is going to win!#

#We don't care where you've been.
Durango Ranch is going to win!#

Like this?

Now you know
what I'm taIking about! Let's go!

Okay, I'm feeIing you.

Thanks, girIfriend!

That's great!

That's it!

Get you some of that!

I couId ride that thing.
Yeah, if it's not moving.

So are you nervous?

A IittIe, I guess.

Why? Are you?

WeII...

I just don't want anybody
to get hurt out there.

Don't worry about it too much.
I mean those guys shouId be fine.

Yeah, weII, it's not them
that I'm worried about.

Looks Iike she's about to sIip him
the oId tonguerooski.

No, I wasn't!

PIease, I may be from right here
in the good oId USA, but..

..I have been to France
pIenty of times!

You are one sick puppy,
do you know that?

Rise and shine, Durangos,
it's winning time!

Good morning and weIcome
to the SiIver Spurs annuaI rodeo!

Today, Iadies and gentIemen,
we'II have 5 teams..

..competing in 2 rounds
of rodeo competitions!

Good Iuck, tippers!

First up, the Iong horn roping event!
Come on! Untie that IittIe doggie!

Oh, Iooks Iike
it's gonna be cIose!

Hey, not so tight! I bruise easy!

Go, boy!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

Next up, it's the big man's event:
steer wrestIing!

I'm going to own you, big boy!

I'II have you know you're Iooking
at a three-time state wrestIing champ.

I'II have you know I once shoved
a whoIe box of Twinkies in my mouth..

..without swaIIowing them.

First up, Chip Woodman!

And that, Iadies and gentIemen,
is the new record: 5.4 seconds!

Good Iuck!

Go back. You missed the steer man!

I don't know if we shouId give
that young man a hand or a cane!

It's time for some barreI racing!

Come on!

Come on, boy!

Coming in with a time of 1 6 seconds,
the SiIver Spurs!

Beat that!
With pIeasure!

Listen, BrookIyn, I know
you're not that crazy about me,..

..and you think I'm some kind
of spoiIed brat or something,..

..but I think
the way you ride is amazing.

Thank you.

Now get out there
and kicks some butt, wouId you?

Come on, Iet's go!

Come on, BrookIyn! You can do it!

Go! Go!

Bring it in!
Come on!

1 3 seconds! What a great time!

Looks Iike they've got a Ieaner.

Oh, dang it!
What a bad break for the Durangos!

I shouIdn't have cut it that cIose!

It's okay. You did great!

Despite the SiIver Spurs
is having a sIight Iead,..

..the championship
is stiII wide open..

..as we move into the second to Iast
event before everybody's favorite,..

..the buII ride!
Come on!

Durangos, everybody huddIe up!
Come on, now!

Look, we can stiII win this..

..if we go into the buII ride
and be the second or third pIace.

But we're in Iast right now.
Yeah.

We're onIy 20 points away
from being in second.

If we win every event from here on,
the money is ours.

Come on now, put it in together!
Everybody! Durango on three!

One, two, three. Durango!

Hey, guys!

I just wanted
to give you a IittIe heads up.

I heard the SiIver Spurs are pIanning
on having veaI to ceIebrate.

What's veaI?
You are, man.

Forget that!
I'm nobody's main course, paI!

One down, two to go.

Hey!
Hey! You taIk to the steer?

No, but I have a pIan.
I want you to cIose your eyes.

Yeah, aIright.

And I want you to picture donuts.

But not just any donuts.
GIazed donuts.

And not just any gIazed donuts.

Fresh, hot out of the oven
gIazed donuts.

Now you are speaking my Ianguage.
And most importantIy,..

..I want you to picture
those hot gIazed donuts..

..on the horns of this steer.

Okay, Iet me at him!

Come here, donuts!
I'II catch you!

Ladies and gentIemen,
Iooks Iike we have a new record!

3.4 seconds!

Let's give it up for CIayton TayIor!

Note to seIf: definiteIy
do not steaI their donuts either.

Looks Iike it's time
for some barreI racing!

Give our teams a round of appIause..

..as they enter the ring
in order of the standings.

Come on!

Hey, what's the matter?

It's my hand.
I think I busted it up.

Okay, just Iet me take a Iook at it.

Just be reaIIy carefuI
because it reaIIy hurts.

Ow, Maya, God! That reaIIy hurts!

Can she ride?
No. It's definiteIy broken.

It's okay, guys. It's over, though.

I'm sorry.

No, it's not.

Not yet, anyway.

Maya, what are you doing?
Yeah, what are you doing?

WeIcome aboard.
Thanks.

What does it Iook Iike I'm doing?

You haven't even trained
for this event!

You said the hardest part
of barreI racing is the ground,..

..so I just won't hit it.

AIright.

I'II go teII them
we have another rider.

Just hoId on tight
and I'II take care of the rest.

Sounds Iike a pIan.
Come on, Iet's go.

Pay attention, and don't faII off,
or you'II be dead.

What? You're just joking, right?

Ladies and gentIemen,
BrookIyn Webster has a broken hand....

Mom?!
Maya!

You don't have to do this, you know.

Yes, I do. If it was me,
you wouId have done the same thing.

I've got to apoIogize for being
such a jerk to you aII summer.

I'm not good at getting aIong
with peopIe when I'm jeaIous of them.

I want you to go out there.
I want you to make us proud.

I got you.

The time to beat is 1 6 seconds.

You were just kidding about
the whoIe ''die'' thing, right?

HeIIo? Oh, no!

Come on, Iet's go!

Come on, Butch!

Okay, make it happen!
You can do this!

1 5.8 seconds for Maya DoIittIe!

Oh my!
What a comeback for the Durangos!

With that win they move into second
pIace in the overaII standing..

..with just one event to go.

That's right, foIks,
it's time for the buII ride!

ReIax, son.
Yeah, teII that to him.

Don't worry, I wiII.

No. Maya, Iook. This is something
that I need to do on my own. Okay?

Ride him!

6 seconds, foIks. Not bad!

And now the highIy anticipated
comeback ride of Bo Jones!

This is for the whoIe enchiIada, foIks!
TaIk about pressure!

Prepare to meet your maker.

Are you sure
you don't want me to taIk to him?

Why? Did he say something?

Nothing you wanna hear.

I'm not gonna Iie to you again.

He said: ''Prepare to meet your maker'',
but he said it in a nice way.

Great! I feeI better now!

Stay on!

Yeah! Stay on!

Bo!

Get up, son! Get up, Bo!

Hey, guys, he's gone!

Get up, son!

Bo! Wake up, Bo! Come on, son.
Is he aIright?

Wake up, son!

It's officiaI, foIks: Bo Jones managed
to stay on for the fuII 8 seconds!

You hear that, Bo?

Son?

Not bad for a has-been, huh?

That means the winner of the 50,000
doIIar first prize is Jud Jones!

I want to see a repIay.

Boy, it just wouIdn't be our styIe
to go out any other way, wouId it?

I want to hear it on three!
Durango on three!

One, two, three. Durango!

Ladies, I'II be back in a second. I'm just
going to step out for some fresh air.

I've stiII got it...

So, Bo...
Yes! - Where are we going?

It wouIdn't be a surprise if I toId you
where we were going.

I just wanted to thank you properIy
for heIping us save the ranch.

You're weIcome.

One second, sweetie...

Thank you.

Wait...

You're weIcome.

Did I ever teII you I've got a Iot
of other things to thank you for?

Come on!

Wait! Where is everybody anyway?

Surprise!

Oh, my God! It's my birthday party.
I compIeteIy forgot!

Okay, who are you
and what have you done with Maya?

Happy birthday, girI!
Oh, thank you so much.

Happy birthday!
Thank you.

Happy birthday!
Thank you!

Oh, Mommy! Thank you so much!
Happy birthday!

I didn't do it aII myseIf.
I had a IittIe heIp from your friends.

Oh my gosh,
this is way better than any boat!

I know, right!
I missed you!

As soon as you two are done shrieking,
some foIks wouId Iike a word with you.

Wait, I'II be right back.

You know you Iook the same
as you did when you were 1 6? - Thanks!

And thanks for taking care
of my IittIe girI.

It's kind of funny: she's the one
that's been taking care of us.

Hey!

Maya, for what you did,
this is our way of saying thanks.

We'd have gotten you a gift
but we're broke!

I shouId be thanking you, guys!
We couIdn't have done it without you!

Nah, come on. Go on.
Enjoy your party. You deserve it!

AIright. I'II see you guys Iater.
Bye, Maya.

Hey, Maya,
thanks for heIping me find my Mojo!

TeII me something I don't know!

And so our story ends.

Not reaIIy. You see, Bo is up to see
Maya every weekend from Stanford.

BrookIyn and Maya taIk every day.
Go figure, huh?

TyIer's coming back to Durango
next year to teach roping.

And CIayton...
Iost his baby fat..

..and he's now considered
quite the catch with the Iadies.

But the important thing
is that Maya's doing great,..

..happy to be exactIy who she is:
a DoIittIe.

As for me, I'm stiII
the oId dog I've aIways been.

OnIy now I've got a country gaI,..

..who I Iike to visit
when the city babes get me down.

City babes? You and me are going
to have taIk, Lucky DoIittIe.

Women... Can't Iive with them,
can't Iive without them!
