[wheels rolling]

[bells ringing]


in a country far away,

there were four children

who ran away from home.
without their parents?

They didn't have any
parents.

Their parents were dead.

They died in a plane crash.

How horrible.

That's what happened.

Crunchy ice.

Sip it once. Sip it twice.

You coming back?

You want me to?

You want to?

Hey.

How ya doing?

Sam take off your coat.

I got my report card today.

Straight A's?

I made a C in art.

Have you seen my joke
book?


I'm tired of hearing those
jokes.

Sam, go feed the cat.

Take off your coat.

[bell rings]

or what was left of them,

in a hole they dug in the
backyard,

next to the graves of
their dead pets.

a pretty big hole.

Unless...


Well. Unless there are only a
couple of pieces left like...

their heads, or an arm or a
leg.

You, are disgusting.

A big enormous castle,
all by themselves.

they ran away from home.

the story, would you?

That's what you said.

There.

My joke book isn't here.

Sam, if you wear your coat
in the house,

it won't keep you warm when
you go outside.

I know.

run away yet,

because...

they couldn't get
out of the house.

Everything was locked
from the outside.

All the doors were locked,
and the windows...






... by the authorities.



Because they knew things

they weren't supposed
to know.

Oh, my God.

What?

They caught her.

Finally.

Why couldn't they
just leave her alone?

Because she robbed
a bank, dummy?

They're saying she
was brainwashed.

Bullshit. They're the ones
who brainwash people.

Brainwashed?
What does that mean?

That means someone
makes you think something

that you know isn't true.

How do they do that?

They just keep telling you
lies until you believe them.

She's in prison now.

That's where they
put bank robbers.

[motorcycle pulls up outside]

Maybe she'll escape.

Take off your shirt.

It's cold in here.

Wussy.

I'll do it.


Wait... wait, maybe
we should stop.

No.

What about...

I've been taking
birth control pills.

Where'd you get 'em from?

Who cares? I got em.

Don't you want to?

Well, yeah of course I do.

It's gonna hurt.

Do it.

[car door slams]

Shit. Shit.

[woman clears throat]

Where are my children?

Janie...

Hi, Mommy.

Hi, sweet angel.
What did you do today?

I took a test in geography.

We had to fill in all
the states on the map,

and name the state capitols.

I knew them all.

How did I get such
a perfect little girl?

Where did you come from?

You know where.

Where?

From you and Daddy.

What's the matter Mommy?

Oh, nothing.

I just, I went to the doctor.
I was feeling a little sick.

Poor Mommy.

I don't think you have a
fever.

Come here.

Ah.

Goddamned son of a bitch.

Where's Maggie?

I don't know.

Hi, Sammie.

Hi, Mom.

Where were you?

In the garage.

What were you doing?

Nothing.

You were breathing
weren't you?

If you were really doing
nothing, you'd be dead.

You're brainwashed.

Are you all right?

Course I'm all right.

we have for dinner?

How about...

... eggs and bacon...

and toast

Yummy.

What's for dinner?

I'm making eggs and bacon.

That's breakfast, Mom.
You missed it.

What were you and Ryan
doing in the garage?

Don't walk away from me.

[door slams]

[loud rock music starts]

Promise me you won't grow
up to be like your sister.

I promise.

You're brainwashed.

doors are locked,

there has to be
another way out.

The roof.

It's five stories high.

off the roof into the snow.


[Sam and Janie] Yeah.

All right. They climbed
onto the top of the roof,

and jumped off into the
snow.

They started to run away,
but...


jump.

And he came after them...

think of something quick.



I know...

Something brilliant.

I know!

[Maggie and Janie] What?

"Possum."



[car door slams]

Daddy.

Hello, sweetheart.


yours?


Hello, Donna.

Hello, Martin. How are you?

How are you?

Fine.

Mommy went to the doctor.

I wasn't feeling well.



Can I fix you another drink?

That'd be nice.

Janie, would you
like a drink?

That would be nice.


remember where you were

the last time you had it.

But, I can't remember.

That's how you find it.

you go, Princess.

One soda pop on the rocks.


There's a dent in your car.

Did you hit something,
or did something hit you?

Will the insurance pay for it?

Well it helps if you tell them
what happened.

Maybe someone hit the car
while it was parked.

That sounds right.

Hi, son.

Hey, Dad.

It's time to wash
your hands for dinner.

They're not dirty.

Ah. It's a good policy to
wash them anyway.

OK.


Hello, Christian.


You been reading?

Uh huh.

Sam go tell your sister
to come to supper.

[Sam shouting]
Maggie, dinner.

Bacon and eggs.

I always liked having bacon
and eggs for dinner.

Feels kind of special.

Like we're getting up early
and going somewhere.

Yes, we could be
eating breakfast

in the middle of the night
before starting out on a trip.

To Tahiti.

No, the South Pole.

Outerspace.

Maggie, where would
you choose to go?

Anywhere.

Well, I saw they
caught Patty Hearst.

She said she wouldn't let
herself be taken alive.

She knew if she was dead,
everyone would just say

she was crazy instead of
having to face the truth.

The truth is, she's a terrorist.

She's a resistance fighter.

You have to be occupied
to put up a resistance.

She is occupied...
by the system.

The system.

Well, there is a
system of sorts.

A social and political system

that exerts a
measure of control...

You're brainwashed, Dad.

over our our actions...
Dad, you're brainwashed.

... and our thoughts.

Sam, you shouldn't say
that to someone's face.

You say it behind
their backs.

I need another drink.

Let's have a spelling bee.

Spelling bee?

With all my good spellers?

[Sam and Janie] Yeah.

Well, OK. Let's see.

Janie, can you spell familiar?

Familiar.

F-A-M-I...

L-I-A-R
Good.

Now, Christian. Can you
spell sanctuary?

What's a sanctuary?

It's a special place,
a protected place.

Like a hiding place...

Sanctuary.

S-A-N-C-T-U-A-R-Y

Right.

You see, spelling is a skill.

You don't have to know
what a word means

to be able to spell it.

OK, Maggie. How about ...

... Habeas Corpus.

That's Latin.

Well, it's a legal term.

H-A-B-E-U-S

C-O-R-P-U-S.

Not quite. It's H-A-B-E-A-S.

I said it was Latin.

It's fair. It's in the
English language.

Sam, it's your turn.

Can you spell soap?

Why don't you give
Mom a word?




Why don't you give
Mom a word to spell?

Did you get a report
card today, Sam?

Sam.


Where is it.

if she can spell.

Your mother isn't in
the spelling bee.

[Maggie] Why not?
For God's sake, Martin.

Do something.

[clears throat]

Donna, can you spell...

Matrimonial?

As in "matrimonial law?"
I did marry a lawyer, didn't I?


M-A-T-R-I-M-O-N-I-A-L

Good.

Sammie, give me
your report card.

He made all A's


I want to see it.

All A's.

And one C.

That's excellent, Sam.

It is. Don't you
worry about the C.

You can probably still
get into college.

[doorbell rings]

That must be the Knotts.

I'll get it.

Janie, can you
spell damnation?

Is that two words?




Can I fix you a drink, Clark?

what you're having.


Nadia, the usual?

What else?

We were just having a
spelling bee.

Hello, Cantwell children.


A report card?
That's Sam's.

Can I look?

[Sam barks like a dog]
Don't.

He made all A's.

Well, you are smart children.
I know that.


And don't forget
your report card.

[Sam barks]

Sam, stand up.

No, act right.

Come on. I want
you to take these.

Go on. Be a good boy.

Well it's nice...
What are we waiting for?

... to be here.
I don't know.

[dog barks outside]

and looked at each one of
them very, very closely.

They didn't even breathe.

[Donna] What do you mean
But I wish there was...

I would watch the Olympics.



strong.

"possum" worked?


When the cop finally
believed they were dead,

he went off to get help.

So, they went to the beach.

And jumped in a boat.

A sailboat...


Janie, you're just
making more work for me

being in here.

How am I making more work
for you?

because I always
have to take care of you.

You're not taking care
of me right now.

Yes, I am.

the children?

the children are fine.

Wouldn't you say, Donna.

a joke for us, Janie?


Oh, come on.

You can remember
at least one, can't you?

I need the book. I can
only remember a little bit.

Oh, just tell us the part
you remember.

I bet it will still be funny.
Yeah.

OK. So, a man said...

No wait. He liked two girls.

One named Kate and the
other named Edith.

One Spade.

I can't remember the rest.

But at the end, he said, "I
want to have my Kate

and Edith, too?

[all laugh]

Kate and Edith, too.
That's good.

That's great, honey.

Children are wonderful.

This one is.
Come here.

Pass.


love.

They don't ask for anything

They just accept what you
give them.

Why do we we ever grow
up?

Why can't we stay
children forever?

Janie, you have
homework to do.

Children can be selfish,
demanding, and cruel.

How would you know?

I was a child.

Three hearts.

Janie, come on.
Let's get out of here.

Goodnight, Mommy.
Goodnight, Darling.

Goodnight, Janie.
Goodnight, Mrs. Knotts.

Goodnight, honey.
Goodnight.

Go on. I'll be up in a few
minutes.

Where were we?

I bet three hearts.
Goodnight, Princess.

Four spades.

[Nadia] Oh, pass.
[Martin] Pass.

Pass.

me the dummy.

[Nadia] Here we go.
[Martin] Not the first time.

I think I need another drink.

[party chatter continues]


I'm good, thank you.


[Martin] Maggie.
Dad.

Just because your mother
smokes, doesn't mean

it's OK for you to smoke.

Dad?

Yes.

What does habeas
corpus mean?

Ah. Produce the body.

A writ of habeas corpus
means a prisoner must be

brought before the court

to determine if they are
being legally held.

Oh.

Goodnight, Dad.
Goodnight, Maggie.

OK, I see how you are. All
right, I'll give you that one.

Great start, honey.

What have you got there.

I'm pacing myself.

[overlapping chatter]

far out to sea...



They're going to
another country.

A country where children
don't have to have parents.

[cat meows]





[bells ring]

[â™ª record plays: "Right Back
Where We Started From" â™ª ]

â™ª Ooo and it's alright
and it's comin' on â™ª

â™ª We got to get right back to
where we started from â™ª

Sam, have you done
your homework?

No.

Do it now. I'll help you.

I don't want to.

Don't you want to
get all A's again?

No, I want to get all C's.

[music continues]

I can't remember this part.


Big one... big one...

Bunny... bunny, bunny.

[Maggie and Janie laughs]

... and then twirl.

[telephone rings]

Hello.

[clears throat]

Yes, uh, Just
a moment please.

[party chatter continues]

Hello. Hi.

No, she didn't say anything.

I told you, she
didn't even notice.

Not tonight,
we've got company.

Who else.

No, you shouldn't come over
tonight. It's not a good idea.

Is that Ryan?
Let me talk to him.

I have to go. I'll
talk to you later.

Come on. I just
want to say hello.

Ryan, sweetheart, it's
Donna. How are you?

I know you were
over here this afternoon.

You didn't even come
in and say hello to me.

Why don't you come
on over right now?

No, I am sure Maggie
wouldn't mind.

What is the matter with you?


Ouch.
I have to get the knots out.

He wanted to come over.

He loves you.

Ow, you're hurting me.

Do you want me to brush
your hair or not?

No, I'll do it.

No...

I'll do it.

You don't know
what love is.

Yes I do.

It fills you up. It makes
you feel happy and full.

No, it's the opposite.

You know that feeling
you get here

when you slip on the stairs?

For one second, it's
like the whole world

is a hole you're falling into...

That's what love feels like.

Like you're falling down
a hole inside yourself.

Do you love Ryan?

No.

Sam.

Do you have to go
to the bathroom?

No.

[party chatter]

to this. Listen to this.

the butt of any of your jokes.

Bobby Darin.

having any Bobby Darin.

reasons I like this album.

[Donna laughs]


[music plays]

[party chatter continues]

I like Mr. and Mrs. Knotts.

They're idiots.

Why are they idiots?

Because they come
over here every night.

Daddy like them.

Shut up. I can't concentrate
while you're talking.

Dad could beat Mr. Knotts

in an arm wrestling
match any day.

Mom could beat
Mrs. Knotts, too.

Shut up.

Grown ups don't
arm wrestle.

You win.

[door closes]

[bell rings]

They sailed far away from
land. Far fro everything.

And then, one day when the
younger girl was fishing...

something jerked the line.

So hard it pulled her
overboard.

She held onto the line as the
fish dragged her away.

And then, the line broke.

And the fish swam away.

She floated, waiting for the
boat to find her.

But it didn't come.

At night, God pulls the
covers up over the earth,

and puts it to bed.

The world never
goes to bed.

While one half is asleep, the
other half is always awake.

But it keeps the light on.
That's why you see stars.

They're little tiny
holes in the blanket...

for the light to come through.

That's not what
the stars are.

Space is empty,
and the stars are on fire.

Nuh uh. Mommy told me
when I was a little girl.

Mom is a well known liar.

She was just telling you a
story.

No.

Another stupid, drunk story.

Don't say that.

Take it back.

You have to take it back.

OK. OK.

I take it back.

I want my Mommy.

And just as she was about to
drown...

she turned around, and
there was an island.

She lay down on
the sand half dead.

The next day, she heard
voices and saw some

natives making a fire on the
beach.

"She's already half
cooked by the sun,

so it won't take long,"
one of them said.

And then the Chief's son,
who was handsome,

said, "She is beautiful.
I'd rather not eat her."

And then another said, "We
have to kill her.

She will feed us for a week."

Then Takuna said to her,
"My tribe is hungry.

Help us and I
will spare you."

Then she reached
into her pocket,

and pulled out
some seeds and said,

"I have beans and corn,

and tomatoes and apples.

We will plant them,
and you'll have a garden.

and never be hungry again."

[party chatter]

[Donna shouts]

Hello sweetheart, what are
you doing down here?

Maggie said I was stupid.

Oh. You are not stupid
sweetheart.

And you can tell Maggie

that I said you are
smarter than she is.

Can I stay here
with you, Mommy?

Aw, now the little
con artist comes out.

For five minutes.
I won't say anything.

No. You have to
go back upstairs.

We're having a
grown up evening.

Oh.

I found my joke book.
I'll tell you a joke.

Janie.

There was once a little ...
Janie.

... who was very, very poor.

I think you'd better go
upstairs now, Janie,

like your mother says.

Maggie said the stars
are on fire.

She said God doesn't pull
the covers over us at night.

The stars are on fire.
And God is very busy.

She's just very tired.

Hey, you tell Maggie that
I said to put you to bed.

Now?
Now.

Goodnight, Janie.
[Nadia] Goodnight, Janie.

Goodnight, Janie.
Goodnight, Janie.

She's exhausted.

[Christian and Sam play]


Takuna, kissed her,

and the natives
danced around her.

<i>And Takuna asked her to</i>
<i>marry him.</i>

<i>And she said, yes.</i>

And they went to go
live in his tree house.


Well, one day a year later,
the boat came to the island.

A year?

What could they be
doing for a year?

Never mind.

[music starts]

Dance it up.

I'm gonna dance
with your wife.

Don't step on her toes.

[Clark] I'm not. - [Martin]
She doesn't like that.

whipped cream?

we could whip some up.


Come back inside, Janie.

No you can't come out here.


Oh, great.

Wow.

It looks different
from up here.

We're on a spaceship.

We've been traveling
the universe.

But now, we're going home
to our own planet, Megatron.

Navigator, where are we?

Lost in space, Captain.

But I can find our
way out of here.

We must be tangled
up in the blanket.

Tie up the prisoner.


I'll set a course
for Megatron.

South by Southeast.

Navigating by the stars.

Warp factor five. Full speed.

America.

and the wind started to blow

and the ocean threw the

Christian, be careful.

with a hundred sails on it.

As the boat drifted closer,

they saw pirates,
smelly pirates

with tattoos and
missing teeth.

Aliens, aliens. Take 'em
out. Take 'em out.

a big net down on them

and hoisted them
up over the deck.

Then Red Beard, the
captain, said,

"Ah. I spy a young man.

A fancy pants.

We'll have to get rid of him."

So they put him
on the plank,

and all the pirates
were yelling,

"Walk the plank,
walk the plank."

and looks down
onto the ocean.

Captain, it's a meteor.

The steering mechanism...
It's jammed.

with a half twist.

...into the ocean.

Ah.
Christian.

[Janie screams]
[Maggie] Christian.

Not even a splash.

Christian, I'm coming.

Is someone hurt?

Oh, the kids just wanted to
play , um emergency room,

so I was just
getting some stuff.

Well, don't let
anyone get hurt.

I won't.

Maggie, remember
when you

won the sixth grade
spelling bee?

We worked on it every night,
learning all those words.

What was that word?
The winning word.


Uh, it's... uh...

"Icthyophagous"

I-C-H-T-H-Y-O

P-H-A-G-O-U-S

Fish-eating.

Goodnight, Dad.

Maggie.

Is there...

Do you need
help with anything?

Any problems...
I could help you with?

I can handle it.

I was just trying
to scare you.

You scared me.

Me too. I thought
I was falling off, too.

It's OK Sammie. Don't cry.

Yeah, I'm fine, see.

I thought I was falling
off the roof with you.


Who wants ice cream?

So this guy, this oil tycoon,

California on a big
old plane, and he

gets there and he checks
into this big old hotel.

He wants a drink, so he
goes to the bar

and there's this pretty little
lady at the other end.

So, he goes and chats

with her and they
start putting down

double drinks,
rounds and rounds.

And they get hungry, right?
Yeah

So, they go to the
restaurant of the hotel,

and they order the
biggest steaks on the menu

and this big huge flaming
fancy French dessert.

"Ma'am would you like
to go up to my room?

It is the biggest suite
in the whole hotel.

She says, "Yeah."
And so they go up there,

and start fooling around.

And he takes off this
big old cowboy hat.

He takes off his big old
cowboy boots.

And he unbuckles his
big old cowboy belt buckle.

And he drops his pants.

And he says, "Ma'am, I'm
just gonna have to warn you,

I'm from Fort Worth Texas
and I am big.

And he takes off his
underwear

and he shows her what he's
talking about.

[Donna laughs]

Then he spreads
her legs open,

and he thrusts
himself inside her.

And he stops.

And he looks down.

He looks back up
at her in amazement.

He says, "Golly ma'am.

What part of Texas
are you from?"

[Donna and Clark laugh]


Texas are you from?

What part of Texas are you
from, ma'am?

[Donna shouting] Big man.


it's not that big.

It's more like the
Rio Grande.

[Donna] Stop. Stop.

You know what I'm
saying...

[Clark laughs]

Don't look at me like that.

God.

grown ups here, right?

Oh, Nadia, what?
You didn't know?

Did you know?

You didn't bother
to hide it. Did you?

Now we all know.

You could have
had the decency...

[Donna] The decency to
lie? - The decency...

to pretend

bring it into this house.


I will bring my life,
all of it, into my home.

to get another drink.


bottom of the world.

It was cold. It was freezing.

And the boat ran into an
iceberg and got stuck.

So, they got out to push it.

And all the other kids
jumped back on the boat.

But a little boy was
standing on the iceberg,

and it was floating away
from the boat.

And then he couldn't even
see the boat anymore,

because there was
a blizzard

and giant snowmen all
around him.

20 feet tall, staring
at him with white eyes.


Shit.

[Donna sobs] Goddamn it.
Mom.


[toilet flushes]

I'm sick.

You're sick to your stomach?

I'm just sick.
Sick of everything.

Hand me my drink.

You should take it
easy on that stuff.

I'll take that under
advisement.

I just. I think...

I don't care what
you think about it.

You don't care what
I think about anything.

You hate me.

I don't hate you, Maggie.

You can't hate
your own child.

It's too much a part of you.

It's too much like you.

I don't want to be like you.

Am I really that bad?

No, I just want to be
different.

Who I want to be.

Don't get your hopes up.

Is that why you're fooling
around with Mr. Knotts?

I saw you.

Whatever you
think you saw...

Are you fucking him, too?

Feel better now?

No, now I need
another drink.

Sorry, that's not funny.

No, you're a riot, Mom.

We all think so.

Me and Christian,
and Janie, and Sam.

This isn't about you.

You try to make
everything about you.

But, this is my life.
This is about me.

[bell rings]

a time in a country far away,

there were four children
who ran away from home.

Without their parents?

They didn't have
any parents.

sailed far out to sea,

past the last known country,

into uncharted waters, where
no adult had ever been.

Until they reached their
destination: Child Land

This would make
a good novel.

One I'd like to read.

Everywhere there were
pizza shops, and bakeries,

and bowling alleys, and
swimming pools.

You seem to be enjoying
yourself.

What's wrong with that?

Then she started noticing

there were lots of 16 year
olds, but no 17 year olds.

Finally, a kid told her, "They
get too old for Child Land,

so we put them to sleep."

Otherwise they would
become grown ups

and take over the country.

You cannot just do
whatever you please.

Watch me.

Well, I guess we're in
this together, aren't we?

So she went underground,

and joined the
resistance movement

that was trying to save

the lives of teenagers
in captivity.

But the other kids
wanted to find her

She sent them a message...

...in code.

Every number stood
for a different letter.

The message said...

[loud knocking]

you to come downstairs.

I'll be back soon.

Go to sleep.
[knocking]


Don't do this.

Maggie, your mother is
trying to destroy this family.

Please, Martin.
Leave her out of it.

how much she's hurting you.

You want to be
a family, don't you?

You want a mother?

Martin, it's too late
for all of this.

It's not too late.
We are still a family.

Tell her, Maggie.

Tell her.

Tell him.

You tell him. It's your baby.






[bells ring]

to finish the story.

escape, all of them.



a message in code.

The message said she
would come and visit them

in the middle of the night.

But she couldn't stay.

But, as she slipped
off into the night,

she dropped scraps of cloth

Bits and pieces she tore
from her clothes.

and left a trail for
the kids to follow.

It led them to the
edge of a deep hole

so deep they couldn't
see the bottom.

They fell and fell, and

just when they thought they
would never stop falling...

... they landed...

... at the entrance
to a secret tunnel.

And they could hear the
sound of the ocean.

[alarm clock sounds]

though the tunnel...

to the boat.

off from the dock.


And they lived
happily ever after.

â™ª When this old world
starts getting me down â™ª

â™ª And people are
just too much â™ª

â™ª For me to face

â™ª I climb way up
to the top of the stairs â™ª

â™ª And all my cares
just drift â™ª

â™ª Right into space

â™ª On the roof it's
peaceful as can be â™ª

â™ª And there the world below

â™ª Can't bother me

â™ª When I come home
feeling tired and beat â™ª

â™ª I go up where the air

â™ª Is fresh and sweet

â™ª I get away from the
hustling crowd â™ª

â™ª And all that
rat-race noise â™ª

â™ª Down in the street

â™ª On the roof the
only place I know â™ª

â™ª Where you just
have to wish â™ª

â™ª To make it so

â™ª At night the stars
put on a show for free â™ª

â™ª And darlin' you
can share it â™ª

â™ª All with me

â™ª Right smack dab
in the middle of town â™ª

â™ª I found a paradise

â™ª That's trouble proof

â™ª And if this world
starts getting you down â™ª

â™ª There's room enough
for two â™ª

â™ª Up on the roof

â™ª Up on the roof

â™ª Everything is all right

â™ª Up on the roof

â™ª Everything is all right
