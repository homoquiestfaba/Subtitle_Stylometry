<i>I cannot bear it.</i>

<i>I will not believe
she's gone from all of us,</i>

<i>From me.</i>

<i>Melanie wilkes
was my only true friend.</i>

<i>How could she leave me now</i>

<i>Just when I need her most?</i>

...And commit her body
to the ground.

Earth to earth...

Ashes to ashes...

<i>And, oh,
my poor darling ashley,</i>

<i>Because
of my life's destruction,</i>

<i>Now the only thing left
of me of that wreckage.</i>

Whoa.

<i>This awful day
will be over soon.</i>

<i>Then I can go home...</i>

<i>To tara.</i>

Oh, melanie...

Don't leave me.

Please, don't leave me,
melanie.

Oh, melanie. Melanie.

Ashley, stop it.

Ashley, don't.

Stop. Stop it.
You mustn't.

Leave my brother
alone.

Take your hands
off of him.

Leave him alone.

Haven't you done
enough harm?

If it's harm to have loved
melanie wilkes

With all my heart

And her husband
near as much-

In the name of heaven,
ladies, cease.

Cease this instant.

I'm ceasing.

Ashley.

Ashley,
come on.

Ashley, come along.

Come along, now.

Hail mary, full of grace,

The lord is with thee.

Blessed art thou
amongst women,

And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb jesus.

Excuse me, miss scarlett.

Gentleman here
to see you, ma'am.

What gentleman might that be, pansy?

Mr. Hamilton, ma'am.

Now, he says you wasn't
expecting him, but-

I'll say I wasn't.

Well, send him
on in, then.

Evening, scarlett.

Well,
here's a surprise.

Have a seat,
I guess.

I just thought
I'd stop by

And see how you're doing...

Mm-hmm.

After all that considerable
upset this morning.

That was most unfortunate.

Was it really all that
chilly out there, uncle henry,

Or was it only me feeling the cold draft

Of pompous
disapproval?

There was a bit
of a nip in the air.

Guess you've got a point
about the other.

Seems like a fair amount
of that disapproval

Was coming off you,
I'd say, henry.

What brings you by,
anyhow?

I thought
I might be able

To offer you
a little advice

That might ease
your situation.

What situation
is that?

The situation
that brought about

That unseemly display
of mutual animosity

At the cemetery, scarlett.

Now let's face
the facts a bit.

Feelings are running real high
against you here in atlanta.

Everybody seems
determined to believe

That you had your eye
and your intentions

Set on ashley wilkes

Right up to the time
melanie passed on.

That's a damn
scurrilous lie!

Scarlett, if I may offer
my best advice,

I think it would do
a world of good

For everybody concerned

If you would just remove
yourself from atlanta for a while.

Give tempers time
to simmer down.

Run away with my tail between my legs?

Well, I guess you'd all be real pleased

To see me take the next boat to timbuktu

On a one-way
passage.

You got the tar, the feathers, and the rail

Waiting outside,
have you?

I was just making
a kindly suggestion.

No more, no less.

I'm making
a kindly suggestion

For you to leave
my house, henry hamilton.

In spite of everything, scarlett,

I want to say
I was real upset

To hear about you and rhett
coming to a sorrowful end.

Well, maybe it's
sorrowful,

But whether
it's the end or not

Remains to be seen.

Hyah! Come on! Hyah!

Hyah! Come on!

All out for jonesboro.

Scarlett!
Hey, scarlett!

Will!

Oh, will.

I'm so glad to see you,

I'm practically
crying for joy.

Well, I guess you've
been doing enough crying

For grief, scarlett.

Joy wants his turn.

It's been
such a long time,

Almost a year.

More like two,
I guess.

You're exaggerating.

Don't believe I am,
scarlett.

Well, we best
get a move on

If we're gonna
beat the dark home.

Let's beat the dark home.

Pansy, see to the luggage.

Hope you don't mind
riding rough.

Figured as long as I was coming to town,

Might as well
get some supplies.

I don't mind at all.

How's my dear sister
taking to the idea

Of me showing up
on your doorstep

Out of the clear blue sky?

I told suellen to let bygones be bygones.

I'm offering you
the same advice.

I'm hoping
you'll take it.

You know I'm not a person
to carry a grudge.

What's happened
to tara, will?

It's looking
downright ramshackle.

Do the best I can
keeping it up

When I'm not
tending the crops.

I know you do, will.

You've always been
a steady man,

The best foreman
we ever had at tara.

I'll bet you've been
a good husband to suellen,

Lots better that frank
kennedy would have been.

Well, coming from the
former mrs. Frank kennedy,

I guess I can take that as a compliment.

I thank you for it.

Whoa.

Whoa, now.

Suellen, god's nightgown,
you're having another?

We're still trying
for a boy.

He's trying for a boy.

I'm trying to take care
of the two I got.

And speaking
of which,

Let me get a look at
my pretty little nieces.

My,
how you've grown.

Aunt scarlett's here with
delicious surprises for you.

Oh, your aunt scarlett's

Always been one
for surprises.

Uh, let's-let's go in.

Lucius, see to
that luggage, will you?

Yes, sir,
mr. Will.

How have you been
getting along?

Just fine, I guess.

You getting
some good yields?

You didn't come back
to tara

To inquire about
our crops, scarlett.

Why are you here?

Why, to see mammy.

And where the dickens
is she, anyhow?

Oh, mammy.

Old mammy
is getting ready

To lay down
her worldly burdens.

I love you, mammy.

No need
for speaking

When I already
knows.

Yes, there is a need.

I never told melanie.

And I didn't tell rhett

Until it was too late.

Wouldn't mind
seeing that...

Devil's face again.

And so you will.

So you will.

Come on.
Just going to say hi

To your uncle seth here.

I'd like to send this
to atlanta, if you please.

Yes, ma'am.

This place could use
some sprucing up.

Looks almost
as bad as it did

The day
the war ended.

I reckon we could buy
enough whitewash

To paint the entire house

With what that fancy dress
you're wearing cost.

You're not being fair, suellen, as usual.

Haven't I tried a
hundred times to help out?

Hasn't will
been too proud

To accept my help?

Your charity, scarlett.

It's not charity.

Tara's still partly
my house, too.

It's not charity.

It's trying to make
what's partly mine

A fit place
to live in.

Yours and mine...

And the sisters of mercy
convent.

What do you mean?

The startling fact is
that our baby sister

Handed over her share
of tara to the convent.

It's her dowry
upon her entry

Into the service of jesus.

Careen did that?

Looks like you'll be having
the catholic church

To contend with before you
can make good your intentions.

What intentions?

Finding a way of throwing
us out to live like crackers.

You's way over the line.

I'll say she is.

I wanted us to be a family
again. Tara's our home.

I wanted us to be a family again in it.

Doesn't seem to be
a chance of that

As long as you hold your grudge against me

For something that happened
a hundred years ago.

Guess it wasn't all that long ago, was it?

Ladies, please?

She won't let
the past be past.

You're not the one
who had her beau stolen

From under her nose
by her very own sister.

If you knew what
kind of a husband

Frank kennedy
turned out to be,

You'd be
thanking me.

You stole frank
to pay the taxes on tara.

You lied to him, telling
him I had another beau.

You only married charles
hamilton out of spite

Because ashley
married melanie,

And you couldn't
bear it.

I guess careen
is the saint

Amongst the three
o'hara sisters.

I obviously
do not qualify.

Well, so much
for bygones, I guess.

That's belle watling's
place, isn't it?

Yes, sir.
Welcome to atlanta.

Yeow!

You are a feisty
little girl.

He come right back
to me.

Pick a card.

Put it back.

That's amazing.

How did you do that?

Show me again,
rhett.

I bet
I'll figure it out.

One time per trick,
honey.

Depending on the trick.

I bet
I'll figure it out

If I seen it
one more time.

Pick a card.

Don't let me
see it, now.

You got it fixed
in your mind?

Uh-huh.

Then put it back.

If I have it wrong,

You win.

If I have it right,

I win.

What do you win?

How many guesses you need,
luli?

Oh, rhett.

Take her away, fellas.

Don't shortchange
him, luli.

Now, can I interest
any of you gentlemen

In a game of chance?

Always a pleasure doing
business with you, rhett.

Evening, mr. Butler.

There's a telegram
for you, sir.

Thanks.

Good to see you, rhett.

You're looking well.

Suellen.

Prosperous, I might say.

Your survival of our
ignominious defeat in the war

Appears to have flourished
with the passage of time.

I've had me
some luck, suellen.

Hmm.

Thank you
for informing me

Of mammy's
dire state.

Came as soon
as I could.

Me?
Your telegram.

I didn't send you
a telegram.

Was there another will
benteen I didn't know about?

I assumed it was scarlett
let you know.

Scarlett.

Hello, rhett.

Mammy, mammy,
I brought you my promise.

Look.

Look who's come to see you.

Hello, old girl.

Am I still a mule
in a horse harness?

Who would ever call
mr. Rhett butler that?

You would, and did.

I must have
been teasing.

You must have been.

You wouldn't
hold it against me

If I asked you
a favor, mr. Rhett?

Not a chance, mammy.

Remember that fine red
silk petticoat you give me?

Yeah. I never gave a prettier to anyone.

I want you to see

That I'm laid
to rest in it.

I'll make sure
it goes with you, mammy.

Would I be asking
too many promises

If I was to have
one more?

Anything you want, mammy.

I want you to take care
of miss scarlett.

She needs caring for
so bad.

I will, mammy.

Always needed caring
so bad,

Miss scarlett did.

Thank you, mammy.

I just can't imagine tara without mammy.

Can you?

Why did you sign
will's name

To that telegraph
you sent me?

It was just a little bit of a fib.

I was afraid
you wouldn't come

If you knew
I was here.

For mammy,
I would have come.

Well,
I'm glad you did.

Apart from mammy,

I just thought
it would be

A perfectly
natural location

For courteous and civilized conversation

Between husband
and wife,

However strained relations
might be between us

At the present time.

I was sorry you couldn't
be at melanie's funeral.

I was traveling.

So I heard.

I laid some flowers
on her grave.

And bonnie's?

Hmm...

I wonder sometimes if things
might have been different

If our child
hadn't died.

Do you ever
wonder that?

No.

I've missed you,
rhett.

I've missed you so.

I hope you don't
expect me

To echo that sentiment.

Well, I thought
you might be able

To express some
semblance of it

After what you said
upstairs to mammy.

I lied.

Don't say you lied.

I will not
tolerate it.

I lied to make a dear old
woman's last moments happy.

No gentleman would lie about such a matter.

No, I don't suppose
a gentleman would.

You are such a child,
scarlett.

You've known me
all these years,

Yet when it suits,
pleases, or satisfies you,

You can forget
all you've learned.

Nothing's changed,
scarlett. Nothing.

I offered you a divorce.

You ready
to accept it yet?

I will never
divorce you.

You'd be free
to marry ashley.

I don't want ashley.

He was only ever
some figment

Of my silly
girlish dreams.

Let me make
amends, rhett.

Please, please
let me make amends.

Whatever amends you care
to make are your concern.

I'll not be
a party to them.

I hope you'll change
your mind about a divorce.

I think it's
the only possibility

Of some kind
of peace between us.

In the meantime,
I'll see to it

We're seen
often enough in public

To keep the gossip down.

I'm leaving in the morning.

Good night, my dear.

The yankees
should have hung you

When they had
the chance!

Whoa.

I've come to see
how ashley is.

You are not
welcome here, scarlett.

I made a promise
to melanie.

I intend
to keep it.

Do you intend
to step aside

And let me come in
like a lady,

Or do I have to
knock you over?

Ashley is in no humor
to receive visitors,

Least of all
unexpected ones.

Where is he?

You can either
tell me, india,

Or I'm going to
find him.

Get away!

Damn it!

Miss scarlett.

Dearest, I-

I didn't know you were back in atlanta.

Don't you look
the dickens?

<i>What are you doing?</i>

Doing? Why...

Nothing.

What I hear is

You haven't been seen
in public

Since the day
of the funeral.

Really?

Well, I suppose
that might well be.

I've rather lost track.

Maybe it's time

You found it again,
ashley.

You mustn't worry about me,
scarlett.

I'll be fine.

Really I will.

When are you going
to start trying to be?

I just can't bring myself

To believe it, you see.

I know how that is-

Somebody you love
dying.

You go to sleep
every night,

And it's gone
for a while,

And you wake up
remembering.

There isn't a moment
of a day

That I don't feel her...

Near...

And think that...

If I were merely to turn...

There she'd be...

My melanie.

Oh, scarlett...

How can I go on
without her?

You're going to have
to find a way, my darling,

And you will.

How?

Well, not like this,

Locking yourself away

And tormenting yourself

With what's never
going to be.

You can stare at that door
until you're old and gray,

And melly's never
going to come through it.

Scarlett,
you are harsh.

Not in my heart.

I know nobody loved melly
the way you did,

But you're not the only one
who did love her.

And the rest of us

Aren't going to curl up
and die from it,

And neither are you.

Maybe you should be giving
some thought to your son,

Melanie's son.

You're all he's got now.

Is this what
you want her to see

Looking down on you
from heaven-

Her boy all alone
and grieving alone

Because his pa feels too sorry
for himself to remember him,

To remember what he needs?

You shame me now,
scarlett.

Pa used to say

Some of the best things
folks have ever done

Come out of their shame

For the things
they did before.

Now, do you think

Maybe I could have
a cup of tea?

And we'll talk things over.

Tea.

So, now,

What's the situation
with scarlett of late?

I offered her a divorce.

If I know scarlett,

She ain't taking you
up on that.

Not yet.

You got more chance

Of her giving you
a divorce

Than you do

Of getting into
a bank on Sunday.

You going
to the ball this year?

What ball?

What ball?
The masked ball.

The carnival.

I expect
you already received

Your fancy engraved

Personal invite.

Well, I don't know.

Probably.

You get yours?

Ha!

That'll be the day.

But you ought to go,
you know.

Probably do you
a world of good.

I didn't know
I was in need

Of being done
a world of good.

The only thing darker
than your hair of late

Has been your countenance.

I been looking
all that glum?

You haven't been altogether
sparkly, you know.

I think a bit of
your former social life

Might very well
perk you up.

You want
to perk me up?

Climb in here with me.

This ain't built for two.

It depends on which two.

Come on.

Aah!

Why don't you
come home to pa?

That's it.

How do things stand
with my store

And the warehouses
and the land?

Everything is better
than well.

It was a more
fortunate decision

Than you may
have realized

When you sold
your sawmill to ashley.

Why?

Well, it's going under.

Builders always
need lumber.

If they're building.

I know you're
not interested

In what happens
in the world

Unless it concerns you,

But you have got one of
the best business heads

That I have ever met,

Despite the fact
that you're a female.

You might as well know

There was a considerable
financial scandal

In new york
three weeks ago.

What about my money?

Are the banks safe?

The one holding
your funds is.

But investments
are very tight,

And that means
building, too.

And if nobody's
building,

Nobody needs lumber.

Are you saying ashley

Is really in serious
financial difficulty?

You can't boom
without bucks.

This is delicious
sponge cake.

I want my cook
to have this recipe.

Who's the best builder
in atlanta, henry?

Well, define best.

Who can build

A reasonably
respectable structure

Without stealing
too much?

That's a difficult
parley, scarlett.

I'm asking for advice,

Not discouraging opinions.

I suppose a person

Could do worse
than big sam. Why?

Big sam. What do you mean, our big sam?

Our foreman at tara?

Formerly your big sam,
scarlett.

Does the name lincoln
ring a bell with you?

I got to say it,
miss scarlett.

You are a sight
for sore eyes.

Heh heh!

And maybe make them
water a bit, too.

You could've knocked me
over with a feather

When mr. Hamilton
told me

About your
coming back to atlanta

And your subsequent
good fortune, big sam.

The north didn't suit me
after a time.

But I did prosper.

I did prosper,

Enough so's
I could come home

And establish my little
business enterprise.

I'm glad to see you're
doing so well for yourself.

I'm here to offer you the
opportunity for lots better.

I'm just holding my breath,
miss scarlett,

Hoping you're going
to ask me

To build you
a big, new, fine house.

I'm thinking more
along the lines

Of maybe 25, big sam.

50 acres, sam.

I'm not utilizing
all of it.

I won't require
that much land

To build, what,
25 houses.

25 small houses
on standard lots.

Yes, ma'am.

Who supplies
your lumber, sam?

The harrison lumber works
mostly.

Good quality,
fair prices.

If you keep your eye
on them.

You'll be getting your
lumber elsewhere for this job.

How many good rafters
you got over there?

25 houses?

Yes, sir, mr. Wilkes.

I've recently been
contracted to build them.

I'd be mighty pleased

If your outfit could
supply the lumber

To build them with.

I don't see why
it wouldn't be possible.

I will say, sam,

It seems a somewhat
precarious investment

For anyone in these
uncertain times.

Who are the developers?

Some folks I was in
business with up north

For a short spell.

Nice fellas. Highly spoken of up there.

Probably will be down
here, too, in the south,

Where they're expecting to
expand their business interests.

25 homes.

Even of the modest
dimensions

You've suggested, sam...

It's a good deal
of lumber.

I'd say so, mr. Wilkes.

Yes, indeed. We're discussing
a whole lot of lumber here.

Could be a profitable
discussion.

Yes, yes,
I expect it could.

I want you to draw up
a contract

Between samuel o'hara
building company

And atlanta acres
real estate incorporated.

Who in the world
are they?

They are me, uncle henry.

And I'm hereby
officially calling upon

The traditional
confidentiality

Existing between
a lawyer and his client.

What are you up to,
scarlett?

I'm up to keeping
a promise.

And if keeping it
means losing some money

In order to keep
ashley wilkes

From going belly up
in the sun,

Then...I'll just have
to take the loss this time.

Tomorrow's another day.

This is something
I thought I'd never see

In these days of
blatant opportunism.

These are quality
construction.

For once,
the less fortunate

Can be treated
as well as the rich.

It would appear

That maybe all
the old values

Haven't been
entirely lost.

It does seem that way,
doesn't it?

I'm honored to be part
of this.

I hope there's some financial
benefit to be derived

From all this honorable
and uplifting endeavor.

You can't imagine,
scarlett.

No, I suppose not.

I have to confess,

I have virtually no head
for commerce.

My business
is on the brink.

Then like a bolt
from the blue,

Big sam walked
into my office.

The good lord must've
been looking down on me.

I just know he was.

Well, I was getting
worried about you.

Well, your mother
is of her own mind.

Imagine her
having the nerve

To show her face
here tonight.

Ah, but what a face.

You men are all the same.

Ha ha ha!

Good evening, henry,
aunt pittypat.

Aren't you looking royal?

I gather
you've come alone,

But it's just not done
in polite society.

Well, so far I haven't
found so much polite

In the society
this evening.

I'll have to keep looking.

And as for being alone,

Well, I never am.

God is always with me.

I'll save a dance
for you, henry.

Have you saved
one for me, scarlett?

Why, ashley,
you know I have.

Remember when we
used to dance, ashley?

It's hard to remember sometimes.

I wonder if any of us
will ever dance again

The way we used to
before the war.

Our hearts
were different then.

Everything was
different then.

I miss it so,
don't you, scarlett?

Will it ever be that
way again, do you think?

I guess not.

We've got to keep
dancing, don't we?

Oh, my lord.

What is it, scarlett?

I haven't trod
on your toe, have I?

He's here.

He's here, ashley.

I didn't think
he'd come.

I hardly dared hope.

That's the silliest
looking thing

I've ever seen.

Who are you
supposed to be?

Keep a civil tongue

In your pretty head,
young miss.

You are addressing
edward teach,

The most fearsome pirate,

Known far and wide
as blackbeard.

Bluebeard would
be more like it.

Did you recognize
me, too?

I don't need to find the most
ostentatious gown in the room

To know who was under it.

I might've known you'd
say something mean.

I'd know you with a
flour sack on your head.

How would you
manage that?

I'm too much of a gentleman
this evening to say.

I believe you've
been drinking.

Did you come to see me?

No, I came to be seen,
scarlett, not to see.

I'm taking the opportunity

To fulfill our obligations
to the social amenities.

Keeping down
the gossip,

That's all you
came for.

You didn't come
to see me.

That-a girl, dear scarlett.

Whisper your
sweet nothings

Into my burning ears.

You're as tipsy as
a termite in a beer barrel.

I assume that weapon
is not loaded.

I don't think
I'd chance

Being in such close proximity
to you with a loaded pistol.

I suppose you'll be staying
the night at the house.

Imagine
the gossip tomorrow

If I were to check into
the harmon hotel tonight.

I understand you made a spectacle
of yourself at melanie's funeral.

I was only keeping ashley from
making a spectacle of himself.

Ashley had a right
to be a spectacle.

He was well
within his bounds.

You were way outside
of yours.

You just persist
in breaking the rules.

You know that I'd hold you
to account for that.

I've always found it to be one
of your few agreeable aspects.

I don't care what the
mucky-mucks think of me.

I never have, and I'm not going to start.

The more you
natter on,

The more fortunate for you
that that pistol isn't loaded.

Whoa!

Good night,
mr. Rhett.

Miss scarlett.

Y'all have pleasant
dreams, now.

You once carried me
across this threshold.

You can rest assured
that won't happen again.

Who is it?

What do you want?

It's just me,
miss scarlett.

I brought you
a pot of coffee.

I don't want it.

Miss scarlett,
maybe it would-

Get out before I take
a strap to you.

Why would you do that now
that slave days is over?

You never done when slave days still was.

There were plenty
of times I wanted to.

Yes'm,
I could see that.

Go away.

You're doing yourself
real hurt,

Miss scarlett.

It's breaking my heart

To see you
breaking yours.

The only hurt there's going to
be around here is me hurting you

If you don't remove yourself
from my sight.

It wouldn't be
you hurting me.

What's in that
bottle there,

And you'd wake up weeping and
moaning for the doing of it.

Spare yourself the hurt
and me the weeping.

Well...

It's just something
I had to say is all.

Pansy!

I want you
to wash my hair.

And start packing.

We're going
to charleston.

Just lots more
hurtin' in charleston.

Now arriving
in charleston,

The express train
from columbia.

Oh, there she is.
There she is.

Aunt eulalie!
Aunt pauline!

Miss scarlett.

Oh, darling.

Shall we tell her now?

Tell me what?

Let's tell her now.

Tell me what?

Soon as we got your letter
telling us you were coming,

We mentioned it
to eleanor butler.

You told rhett's mother?

We presumed she was already
cognizant to the fact,

You being
her daughter-in-law.

She was just as surprised as we were.

We said you would be
staying with us at our house.

She said, "why, she'll
be doing no such thing."

She said, "you bring her
directly to my doorstep,

Or you will never hear
the end of it."

You will never hear
the end of it.

Is rhett there?

Rhett's up north.

Buying back some of
the family silver

The yankees stole.

Are you saying I'll be
a guest of mrs. Butler's?

She's invited me
to stay with her?

What could be more
natural and fitting, child?

It's your husband's
home, too.

Oh, my dear scarlett.

Oh.

I'm so glad
you've come home.

I've been longing
for you to come.

We'll go to market tomorrow.

You'll meet everyone
you should know there.

It's the traditional place
to learn all the news, too.

The newspapers don't print

The really
interesting things.

I suppose you couldn't
help being aware of

The unfortunate presence
in charleston

Of so many yankee soldiers.

I know you've
been rid of them

For some very long time
up in atlanta.

We've been occupied
for so long,

We hardly notice them
anymore.

I'll never get
used to them, never.

Well, then we'll just
have to do our best

To distract you
from their presence.

We can begin
this very day.

My committee is meeting
here this afternoon.

You must join us,

If only for tea.

I wouldn't want to prevail
on you to participate.

In what?

We raise money
with cake sales

And bazaars of handicrafts
and such

For the confederate home
for widows and orphans.

I'd be quite pleased
to participate

In something like that.

Oh, lovely.

Every bit of help helps.

Giddyap! Come on!

Giddyap! Come on!

Giddyap!

Sally!

Watch it!

Sally.

Jehoshaphat!

We're here.

Who in the heck
is that?

Sally brewton.

She can be mad
as a March hare at times.

Margaret, emma,

We have arrived.

Oh, my.

Well, it's another perfectly
thrilling ride, sally.

One's soul looks
forward to it.

Speak for yourself.

Yoo-hoo!

Eleanor!

Ha ha ha!

Who's that with you?

The new recruit

For our disgustingly
noble cause?

I had always heard that
you would turn the heads

On tin soldiers.

I'm pleased to see that
nobody was exaggerating.

Smoke?

No, thank you.
I don't indulge.

Your husband and I go back
to when he was in knee pants

And I was wondering what those
two funny bumps was on my chest.

Eleanor, where has that son
of yours been keeping himself?

He's in
philadelphia.

What the pluperfect heck
is he doing there?

Why don't you
ask him yourself?

Rhett!

I believe you rang
for tea, mrs. Butler.

Rhett, darling.

Is that what
I think it is?

Is that my tea service?

<i>Oh, lord, it is
my tea service.</i>

Where on earth
did you find it?

Philadelphia.

The place is bursting
with yankee plunder.

I brought a little bit
of it home...

To its rightful place.

I think I'm going to cry.

If I ever had a son, I'd
want to be just like rhett.

A husband would've been
even better.

Sally! Sally!

How you been keeping,
you wolf in wolf's clothing?

I proposed to you on a number of occasions.

You were about
12 years old at the time.

I wanted to get
my bid in early.

Hello, rhett.

Ahem.

It is a fortunate man

Who's offered a greater
surprise than he offered.

I don't believe you know
our newest member

Miss anne hampton.

How do you do,
miss hampton?

Charmed to finally
meet you.

I've heard so much
about you.

Your tender ears
must be sizzling.

Welcome home, rhett, honey.

Welcome to charleston,
scarlett...

Honey.

You might seriously hurt
my arm, rhett butler!

What are you
doing here?

I sure didn't
come all this way

To lend my time
and efforts

To the confederate widows
and orphans sewing society.

I'm here
to be with you.

I no longer love you.

Don't say that. I'm your
wife. You're my husband.

An unfortunate circumstance
I offered to correct.

I will never divorce you
never, never!

Your mother's overjoyed
that I'm here.

What will you tell her
if you throw me out?

'cause I'll tell her
the truth,

And it'll
break her heart.

I don't have to
throw you out.

Sooner or later,
you'll reveal yourself.

You think you can pass
yourself off as a lady.

Charleston gentry
will see through you.

I am a lady,
damn you!

You couldn't fool
a blind, deaf mule.

Show me
your clothes.

I assume you've armed
yourself with a new wardrobe

To win back
my favors,

All of it in your typically awful taste.

Now show me
your new frocks.

I'll see what can be salvaged, if anything.

Don't catch cold trying
to be alluring, scarlett.

You're wasting
your time.

I think I've been
wasting my time

Since the day I first
laid eyes on you.

Get rid of
all this lace.

It's supposed to be a
dress, not a tablecloth.

Get rid of this one
altogether. It's hopeless.

Change these gold
buttons for black ones

And shorten the train.

Ha ha ha. There's enough bows on this

To decorate
a christmas tree.

I hope you're enjoying
insulting me.

As a matter of fact,
I am.

See if you can make one
of these presentable enough

To be seen in
this evening.

My mother was
a robillard from savannah,

And the o'haras are descended
from the kings of ireland.

Every irishman
I've ever heard of

Seems to have been
descended from a king.

Is it just the one king,
scarlett, or were there several?

Ha ha ha.

I hate you.

Ha ha ha!

I hate you!

Looks like that royal
irish blood, miss hampton.

Sometimes it gets them
carried away.

Won't rhett be joining us, miss eleanor?

I'd hoped to have my
first charleston breakfast

With the company
of my husband.

Oh, but I thought
you knew, my dear.

Well, there-there was a
note from rhett this morning.

He left last night.

He's gone up-river
to dunmore landing.

Didn't he tell you?

Well, aren't I
the perfect dunce?

Certainly he told me.
Completely left my mind.

What a silly willy I am-
certainly, your plantation.

Yes. He spends quite a bit
of his time there these days,

As you're
no doubt aware.

Well...

Maybe it's just as well

I have a private moment
with you, miss eleanor.

Oh?

I need you to help me,
miss eleanor.

Well, of course,
scarlett.

How may I? Anything.

I want to
look like a lady.

Well, now, scarlett.

I know that I don't,

But I want to know
what I'm doing wrong.

I am a lady.

Well, of course
you are, scarlett.

Well, it may be that you
have so much vitality,

I mean, all the vigor

Of the world
you grew up in,

It's misleading
to people here

In the old,
tired, low country.

Still, you have no need of
rouge on your lovely face,

And your clothes are...

Well...

Uh...

As some of
your clothes are,

Ill considered.

Yes, w-we'll just
have to find ways

To make you
more like us.

Then you'll be
more comfortable.

Heh.

And I suppose
you will be, too.

Well, I would
never have said so.

Fresh fish! It's over here!

Go on, now.

And, uh, baked goods,
and they're so delicious.

You could gain 20 pounds
just by looking.

Oh, yes, um, I want
some sausage, please.

I'm afraid you're a
little late, mrs. Butler.

You don't
want those onions.

They're no good.

No good?

What's wrong with them?

They're not rotten
or sprouting.

They've been
dug up too soon.

They look fine, but they
won't have any flavor.

Take my word for it.

How do you know?

When I had to run our place
after the war, tara,

I planted onions.

I didn't know beans
about growing things,

So I dug up some when
the tops started to brown.

I figured they would rot.

They didn't have bite
to them at all.

You want these.
They're good onions.

Well, what can you
tell me about celery?

I have an uncommon

If not downright unnatural
adoration for celery.

Celery was too fancy
for us.

I had a dozen mouths
to feed.

Ask me about yams, though,
or white potatoes, turnips,

Or cotton-

You worked the fields?

We had to eat.

Weaved grass baskets.

I'll just go have
look at those baskets.

I hear charleston's
famous for its basketry.

How much
is that?

That's $4.00.

I just love
those.

I missed out
on the darn sausage.

That girl is just about
altogether lacking

In anything that would
pass for an education.

She's got the taste
of a hottentot,

But she's got vigor
and strength and brains.

She's a survivor.

We need her kind
in the south, eleanor,

Even in charleston,

Maybe especially
in charleston.

I'm going
to sponsor her.

I tried your recipe
for peach cobbler.

Scarlett, we have a rather important matter

We'd like to
discuss with you.

What's that, aunt pauline?

Concerning your
grandfather robillard.

Incidentally-

What about him?

It's come
to our attention

That you haven't
written him for years.

Why should I write him?

He's a crabby, mean old man
who's never helped me.

We were hoping you might
come with us to savannah...

For the celebration party.

What celebration party?

Father's birthday.

Well, I guess you'll just have
to do that celebrating without me.

Regardless of your
personal feelings,

You might consider
the question

Of respect
for one's elders.

And family loyalty.

Duty.

And good manners.

Don't you dare preach
over me.

I don't care a fig
for grandfather robillard.

He was horrid to mother
and to me.

You know I'm right.

He treats everybody
like dirt,

Including you,
his own daughters.

Father's sometimes
less than gracious.

Father has
his shortcomings.

That cannot be gainsaid,

But he is our father
nonetheless.

Nonetheless.

And nonetheless,
I won't be in savannah

Watching him
blow out his candles.

What I said
she'd say.

It's what you say.

Can you spare a bouquet for
my hall table, mr. Butler?

Take you'll pick,
miss brewton.

Heh heh heh.

Ahh, flowers.

Ha ha.

You, sir, are a caution.

You and me
go way back, rhett.

Tell me just what
exactly is going on

Between you and
that amazing girl.

What makes you
think that?

Your mother told me

That scarlett was less
than charitable to you

Concerning the death
of your child.

If I hadn't wanted
bonnie to ride that young,

She wouldn't
have been on a horse.

If she hadn't
been on a horse,

She wouldn't
have been jumping it.

If she hadn't
been jumping it,

She'd still be alive.

There were several
remarks to that effect.

That was
obviously grief

Turned upside down
and backwards.

She's put it back
together now.

Why else would
she be in charleston,

Except to show you that?

She's here because she refuses
to believe our marriage is over.

This marriage shouldn't
have occurred at all.

She'd been married
twice before.

She married me
for my money.

She admitted that.

She was madly in love
with ashley wilkes.

Why did you marry her?

Because she was unlike
any woman I had ever known-

Passionate, infuriating.

Ahh, I fell
in love with her

The moment
I laid eyes on her...

Kind of disease,
I suppose.

Now ashley wilkes
is a free man

And would marry scarlett
in an instant.

And I want to
be rid of her.

That only makes her
more determined to have me.

Heh heh.

I'm afraid it might
all happen again.

She's...

Heartless.

She's selfish.

She's like a child
who cries for a toy

And then breaks it,
but...

There are moments...

There are moments that I come
close to forgetting what I know.

Well, maybe
she'll change.

When pigs fly, my dear.

Dunmore landing
coming up now.

Isn't it perfectly stunning?

I'll give you $50,000
in gold-

I beg your pardon?

If you'll go away.

Go away?

A handsome deal, scarlett,

A fortune bigger
than you'd ever hoped for,

A king's ransom.

The king being you,
I guess.

It's funny you should offer
me what you call a deal.

What's funny about it?

I came to offer one.

I shudder to think what
your mind might concoct.

Why don't you just listen
through all that shuddering?

I'm offering for you to
stop acting so hateful to me,

To act nice and help me
have a good time

Through
the social season

Like a happy
married couple.

After the season,
I'll leave.

Without the money?

With the money,
of course.

That's no deal.

There's nothing
in it for me.

You'll take the money to
leave, but you don't leave.

How do I benefit?

I don't stay forever.

I don't tell your mother
what a skunk you are.

Hmm.

I think we might
be able to do business.

I'm always
willing to dicker.

You confide in mother

That however much
you adore me,

I snore incorrigibly
and unbearably,

A misfortune requiring us to
sleep in separate bedrooms.

After
the saint cecilia ball,

You'll express an urgent,
irresistible desire

To rush back to atlanta,

Where you will immediately
engage the services of a lawyer

To negotiate
a legal separation.

You will never again
set foot in charleston.

You'll never write or
otherwise communicate with me.

Swear you'll be nice
before I leave?

Word of honor.

Lacking a bible,
that will have to do.

If you turn mean,
you broke the deal,

And I don't
have to leave.

I still get the money.

Done.

You're a right trial in
the husband department,

But it's nice
doing business with you.

I don't suppose you'd reconsider that
aspect concerning separate bedrooms?

Girl can't
have everything.

Thank you, sir.

10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15,

16, 17...

18.

There you are,
ma'am.

Thank you.

Hi, rhett.

Well, now, here's
a happy surprise.

Ooh, darlin', I was just
hoping I would run into you.

And so you have.

How have
you been, luli?

Just fine
and dandy, rhett.

When you coming back
to atlanta?

I never know when I
might run up there.

It could be I'll be here in
charleston if belle wants.

You don't say.
And why's that?

Business.

Yours?

Mine's the only kind of
business I know, ain't it?

Exploring new frontiers
of commerce, are you?

Mmm...You might say.

Belle's opening
a whorehouse.

You might say that, too.

You're here just in time for the big race,

Horse race I'm running day after tomorrow.

Why the hell you runnin'
a horse race?

I love horse racing.
Can we go?

What horse race?

I won a fine quarter horse in a card game.

The loser suggested
he'd race me for it.

If he wins, he
gets his horse back.

If I win,
I keep the horse

And take his
other one as well.

Why?

Why don't you just settle
for what you already won?

Why are you in charleston?

Touché.

She told you. She's
opening a whorehouse.

Ha ha ha!

Don't let me down
now, rhett.

I bet the mortgage
on you.

Don't tell the missis,
jake.

Don't make me have to.

Good morning.

Hello, mr. Butler.

Who you betting on?

I'm not the betting sort.

I thought horse racing was
always around and around.

No, not this kind.
This kind is straight.

I thought it would
be around and around.

Mother.

Yoo-hoo, rhett!

Are my eyes
deceiving me,

Or is that
belle watling?

Morning, belle.

Hello.

Luli.

Ladies, may I introduce miss belle watling

And
miss luli harris.

My mother, belle,
mrs. Butler senior.

How do?

I don't believe you've
ever met my wife scarlett.

I know miss watling
by reputation.

Glad to make your
acquaintance, mrs. Butler.

Heard lots about you.

I don't expect you
came from atlanta

To see rhett race a horse, miss watling.

I wouldn't travel
6 feet to watch that.

Actually, I'm here on, uh,
business, truth be told.

Oh, I'm so fascinated

By ladies with
business interests.

So very unusual, isn't it?

What business are you
engaged in, miss watling,

If one may know?

You might say I arrange
social get-togethers.

I see. What exactly-

Uh, uh, mother...

I believe it's time for the race to start.

Belle, real good running into you. Luli.

Wish me luck.

I bet a whole dollar
on you.

Don't disappoint me.

He seldom does.

Easy on that
last bend, harry.

Would you care for a mint julep, darling?

Come on.

More!

Faster.

More!

Oh!

Yes!

Whoo!

All right!

Ooh, he sure can ride,
can't he?

I'll say.

Harry.

Congratulations.

Never a doubt,
my friend.

Never a doubt.

Great job.

Congratulations,
mr. Butler.

Congratulations.

Well, thank you so much.

I really
don't believe rhett

Was in need of two
more horses, though.

Didn't have a thing
to do with horses.

It had to do
with him winning.

Much too revealing to me.

When you going to stop all
this lollygagging around, sally,

And accept my oft repeated
proposals of matrimony?

Maxwell, if
I've told you once,

I've told you
more than twice,

Two marriages
were enough for me.

It's nothing personal.

Third time lucky.

Says who?

When I mentioned

I'd recently
made your acquaintance,

Daddy said
you had a reputation

Of some considerable
notoriety during the war.

Wonder what he could
have been referring to.

Are you teasing me?

I made me some money,

And I had me some fun,
miss hampton.

Did you come
in my room last night?

No.

You're lying.

Why would I lie?

I must have dreamt it.

Some random nocturnal
fever overcame you,

No doubt, giving rise
to visions.

Did you come
to my room last night?

Yes.

I expect your
dance card's full.

I threw it away.

I'm not dancing
with anyone but you.

We'll be hearing the
crack of breaking hearts

All over the ballroom.

There's only one
I want to hear breaking.

Pity.

You're a skunk.

It was by far the very
best ball of the season.

And the last.

That's your way
of reminding me

Our agreement
has concluded,

As if I
needed reminding.

I don't want to talk
about that tonight.

We'll talk
about it tomorrow.

Your mother mentioned your
being in new orleans recently.

For a short while.

Did being there bring
to mind our honeymoon?

Sure it did.

That's something, anyway.

Is your boat
out there somewhere?

Mm-hmm.

Does it have a name?

<i>Bonnie.</i>

I suppose I might
have guessed that.

I've never been sailing.

What's it like?

It's wonderful.

I'll bet it is.

I've never been.

All right.

All right,
just this once.

As adam said to eve.

I've never had
so much fun in my life.

Well, more or less.

Bring it about, mate.

Ha ha ha!

We don't want to tangle

With that
kind of weather.

Here. Take the tiller.

This!

I'll drop the jib.

Hold your course, mate!

Start bailing!

Bail out the water!

Rhett!

Scarlett!

Scarlett!

Hold on!

Don't die on me,
scarlett.

Please...

Don't die on me.

Come on.

Come on. Come back
to me, scarlett.

Don't go.

Don't go, scarlett.

Don't go.

Oh, scarlett!

I thought you were gone.

I wasn't dreaming
this time, was I?

Here. Take some of this.

It's just rotgut.
It'll warm you.

I don't need it.

I've never been warmer
in my life.

Listen to me, now.

For the rest of my life.

What happened...

Ahh, it was, um...

It was a celebration
of survival.

Nothing more.

You're saying that
'cause...

That's all
you want it to be,

But what happened
was your true heart,

Your true heart...

You love me.

I know you do.

You love me.

Pansy?

Pansy.

Oh, miss scarlett,

You woke up.

You been sleeping
the longest time.

How long?

What time is it?

How is she?

Well, she woke up
just this minute.

Oh, thank goodness.

Oh, honey.

Miss eleanor...

Ohh.

How long
have I been sleeping?

Oh...

Where's rhett?

Oh, you've been sleeping

Nearly 24 hours, dearest.

How do you feel?

Jehoshaphat.

24 hours?

How could anybody
sleep that long?

You had quite an ordeal.

Don't you remember?

Most of it, I guess.

Where's rhett?

Pansy...

Tell mr. Rhett
that sleeping beauty

Is back from
the land of nod.

Well, maybe not so beauty...

If I look as bad
as I feel.

Oh.

I'm feeling dreadful.

Well, I don't believe
mr. Rhett here...

Right now.

Pansy, go down
to the kitchen

And bring some broth up
for miss scarlett.

And some tea.

The doctor's
been by several times,

And he's given
every assurance

About your condition.

And he says
he wants you to rest

For another day or two.

Is rhett all right?

Rhett's fine.

I've got the most
splitting headache.

Will he be back soon?

Go on, miss eleanor.

It's just like
the poets say.

Sometimes...

Out of the darkest
danger and fear

Comes the most beautiful
and dazzling night.

We almost lost our lives.

And in that near losing,

We found each other
at last.

Oh, scarlett.

What's the matter?

Rhett is all right,
isn't he?

You're not lying to me,
are you?

What's this?

From rhett?

Shall I leave you alone for a bit?

<i>Scarlett...</i>

<i>There's nothing I can say
about what happened yesterday,</i>

<i>Except that
I'm profoundly ashamed</i>

<i>And sorry
to have been the cause</i>

<i>Of such pain
and danger for you</i>

<i>And regret bitterly
all that occurred</i>

<i>After our escape.</i>

<i>My actions
were reprehensible.</i>

<i>I cannot, however,</i>

<i>Deny now the truth
of anything I said</i>

<i>In the aftermath
of our...</i>

<i>Ill-advised
and reckless encounter.</i>

<i>I must not and will not
ever see you again.</i>

<i>Naturally I cannot remain</i>

<i>In the environs
of charleston.</i>

<i>The cash settlement
I promised</i>

<i>Will be transferred to you
immediately</i>

<i>In care of henry hamilton
in atlanta.</i>

<i>I ask you to accept
my sincere apologies</i>

<i>For everything
about our lives together.</i>

<i>It was not meant to be.</i>

<i>I wish you
a happier future.</i>

Miss scarlett,
a messenger just came by.

Delighted as I am to
hear your news, ashley,

I naturally
would've preferred

It had been a visit to me
that brought you to charleston

Instead of some
darned business matter.

Dare I say
my business here

Is more excuse for my
presence than reason for it?

You're not rake enough to say
such a thing to a lady, ashley.

Not and get away
with it.

I sometimes
so wish I were...

Rake enough.

You've heard
the saying

About leopards
and spots, I guess.

Alas, yes.

Alas nothing.

What you are is wonderful and fine, ashley.

You have no cause whatsoever
for regret about it.

It's what
I loved you for.

And made a ninny of myself
for, if truth be told,

And I guess it has to be sometimes.

If rhett butler
had just a smidgen

Of your character
and dignity-

How's rhett? That's the first
mention you've made of him.

Does a leopard
change his spots

For a stripe
down his back?

Are there difficulties?
I thought-

He's left me, ashley.

For good and all
this time, I guess.

I'm so very sorry,
my dear.

A minute ago you said
you brought a surprise,

As if your being here
wasn't surprise enough.

I won't tolerate being kept in
suspense for one minute longer.

I brought you
some photographs.

I'll just go
and get them.

I'll only
be a moment.

Don't be silly.

Save you a trip.
I'll come on up.

You really
think you should?

Fiddle-dee-dee.

I've spent
the past two months

Trying to do
what's expected

Of a proper charlestonian
nose-in-the-air lady.

What I have to conclude
is they're them, I'm me,

And never
the twain's gonna meet.

I hope the accommodations in this
hotel are worthy of you, ashley.

I'm quite content so far.

They're perfectly
wonderful, ashley.

I can hardly wait
to see them real.

Of course the photographs
don't quite do them justice.

They're such fine homes.

They've enhanced
big sam's reputation

In the building trades.

You can be sure of that.

And how about your reputation
in the lumber trades?

I've got almost more
demand than I can supply.

I'm so tickled-pink
for you, ashley.

Will you be coming back
to atlanta, scarlett?

I haven't quite decided

On my next
course of life.

I wish you'd
come back to atlanta.

Do you?

Very much.

Very much.

I think maybe I've got about 10 seconds

To get myself
out of this room.

Scarlett...

5...

Scarlett...

This is charleston.

And you are,
ostensibly,

A lady.

A lady does not
accompany a man

To his hotel room.

And certainly not
in the broad light of day.

And most certainly
not in charleston.

Did this person who saw
me going up the stairs,

Whoever she is,

Since you refuse
to divulge her identity,

Did this person
observe me

Coming back down the
stairs 10 minutes later?

I'd need more time than
that to unlace my shoes,

Much less my corsets.

Scarlett, don't.

You're being vulgar.

I'm sorry.

But you are no longer
welcome in this house.

Well,
that suits me just fine.

'cause this is
no longer a house

In which I care
to be welcome.

Oh, my lord.

Is that me?

How can that be me?

What am I doing?

What have I done to myself?

Is that cowardly
disgusting creature

Scarlett o'hara?

No, it is not.

Scarlett o'hara
doesn't drown her sorrows.

Scarlett o'hara
doesn't hide away

And hope for
what she wants.

Scarlett o'hara goes out
and gets what she wants.

You coward.

Coward!

This here for
miss robillard.

Which of 'em?

Whichever.

Eulalie!

Scarlett's changed her mind!

She's going
to savannah with us!

Ohh.

Oh, my lord.

Oh, lord.

Yes.

Yes.

<i>Well, I guess life's</i>

<i>Just a long game of chance
after all,</i>

<i>Isn't it,
mr. Rhett butler?</i>

<i>That's what a gambling man
like you would say,</i>

<i>Isn't it?</i>

<i>And you think
you've won it</i>

<i>And walked away
from the table</i>

<i>Leaving me high and dry.</i>

<i>Well, you'll be
thinking again</i>

<i>One of these days,
won't you?</i>

<i>You surely will.</i>

<i>Maybe you don't want me,</i>

<i>But I've got something now
you do want...</i>

<i>Always wanted.</i>

<i>The ace
is up my sleeve now,</i>

<i>And I'll play it
when the time's right</i>

<i>When I'm good and ready.</i>

<i>You'll be willing
to walk barefoot</i>

<i>Over hot coals
to come back to me.</i>

<i>We were always two pieces
of the one thing,</i>

<i>My darling rhett.</i>

<i>Now we're three.</i>

God's nightgown!
Who'd have thought

I'd ever set foot
in savannah again?

Father will be thrilled
to pieces that you have.

To pieces.

You know what pa used to
say about grandfather-

Pierre robillard wouldn't
give you the time of day

If your watch was broke.

Even mother laughed at that.

She couldn't deny it, not
even about her own father.

I suppose
father never was

Very fond of gerald
o'hara, if truth be told.

At least I can see
my other kin while I'm here.

What kin is that?

My o'hara kin.

Perhaps you better not
make note of that intention

To your grandfather,
scarlett.

Perhaps not.

Will mind your manners,
won't you, scarlett?

Father is quite old and considerably frail.

Considerably.

Wouldn't do to tax
his declining strength

With your sometimes-
how shall I put it-

Quite forthright manner.

Will it be necessary
to genuflect

When he grants me
audience?

That's what I'm talking
about, scarlett.

You are just being
naughty on purpose.

On purpose.

Well, jerome, we're here.

We're here.

Welcome again to savannah and home, ma'am.

Thank you.

Jerome, this is
our niece, mrs. Butler.

Yes, I remember
miz butler.

How are you, jerome?

I'm well and fine,
ma'am,

And hopin' the same
for yourself.

Jerome!

Is that them come?

The mister's had his
sleeping chamber relocated

To the parlor floor
of the house, ma'am.

The staircase had become a
considerable trial for him to manage.

Jerome!

Yes, sir, mister,
coming right along now.

Doesn't sound all that frail to me.

He's asking for you now,
dearest.

I'll be just a minute,
aunt eulie.

He could scarcely believe
that you were here.

I can scarcely
believe it myself.

You will be nice now,
won't you, scarlett?

I will, aunt eulie,
I promise.

Oh, bless you.

I don't know why I'm
caring how I look anyhow.

He's probably blind
as a bat by now.

I'll try
to keep my promise,

But if you hear any shooting, it'll be me.

Hello, grandfather.

Are you awake?

It's scarlett,
grandfather.

I had hoped that,
in time,

You would come to favor less
your father and more your mother.

I see I am to be disappointed
in that wish.

I guess so. I'm more o'hara
than robillard, grandfather.

Always have been,
if I dare say so here.

I've never known you not
to say whatever you dared.

Sit.

I promised aunt eulie

I'd be
on my best behavior.

You have grown older.

So have you.

But not to such advantage.

Why, grandfather,

Am I mishearing a remark

That sounded so breathtakingly
close to a compliment?

To what do we owe

The dubious pleasure of your
presence here in savannah?

That's more like it.

Aunt eulalie and aunt pauline invited me

To celebrate
your birthday.

It seemed an appropriate
opportunity for me

To attend to a few
other matters here.

Other matters?

One personal, the other more like business.

As to the business-

Have you come
to beg money again?

I never begged you
for money, grandfather.

I only asked for a loan
to feed my starving family

After the yankees
passed through

Leaving nothing but ruin
and death behind them.

I got along
without your help.

I am now a woman
of considerable means.

And I'm here
to spend some of that

On what one of my sisters
saw fit to give away.

I would have to wonder

What it might be

That your sister
would value so little

And you so much.

Tara.

Ahh-ha ha.
Fabled tara.

There's no fable
to it.

It's home.
At least it was

Till careen decided to give
away her 1/3 share in it.

Seems she turned severely
religious for some reason.

It's her intention
to become a nun.

Careen always was
kind of flighty.

To be a catholic,
of course,

Requires
in the first instance

A certain degree
of mental instability.

You made mention of some personal
reason for your presence here.

I'm going to search out
my relatives.

Relatives?

I am the last of the
robillard line in savannah.

I know that.
O'haras, I mean.

Ohh! The peasants?

Maybe some of pa's
brothers are still alive.

Pa would like it
if he knew

I was looking up
my long-lost kin.

Did you really hate pa
as much as he said?

When my youngest and
most cherished daughter

Wed herself
to gerald o'hara,

There was
no visible bottom

To the pit
of disastrous folly

Into which she flung
both herself

And the honorable name
of robillard.

I guess pa wasn't
exaggerating.

May I ask who it was

Witnessed this supposed
indiscretion on scarlett's part?

Supposed? She was seen
entering the drummond hotel

With a man she herself later admitted
to my mother was ashley wilkes.

As for who saw them,
my mother declined to say.

And did
this nameless accuser

Also peek
through the keyhole?

You don't have to take this
too seriously, sally.

How do you know

That what went on between
scarlett and wilkes

Is what you're
thinking?

That's a considerably
naive idea

Coming from someone
of your experience.

Naive, hell.
It's fair.

Since when has scarlett
ever deserved fair?

The woman was forever
inclined to rash behavior

When in a state
of mental distress.

You sure must've
put her in one.

I believe scarlett's never
entirely gotten over

Her feelings
for ashley wilkes

And she decided
to do something about that.

It would be decent of you to hear her side.

Do you know
where she's gone?

No. I'll have to
find out.

You are getting
her side then?

No.

I'm gonna divorce her.

I'll take
one of those.

Yes, ma'am.

Hello.

Morning, ma'am. And ain't it a fine one?

It is.

I'd like to see
mr. O'hara.

You're seeing him.

How might I be
of service?

Actually, the mr. O'hara I'm
looking for would be more elderly.

Mr. Andrew o'hara
or mr. James o'hara.

Perhaps I've come
to the wrong store.

You've come
to the right one.

I'm their nephew, jamie
o'hara at your service.

Oh, my goodness,
then you're my cousin.

Am I indeed?

Certainly one
not known to me.

I'm katie scarlett,

Gerald's daughter
from atlanta.

No doubt
you don't know it,

But my mother passed on.

That was
your auntie bridget.

God rest her dear soul.

Also uncle andy's wife
as well, auntie una.

Ah, took the heart
out of poor uncle andy.

Followed her
within a month.

Uncle james, then,
is he gone, too?

He's not even
thinking of going.

Fair chance he'll
outlive the lot of us.

He'll be beside himself
to see you, katie scarlett.

He's getting on
in years,

But he's still able to
pull his weight. And how.

He's living with us
now,

Me and my wife maureen
and kids.

There's eight of them.

At least that was the count
when I left this morning.

And here's that very house,
be it ever so humble.

But we've all come
from a lot worse, hmm?

And no complaints now.

God rest his soul,

I always said your father
was the best of the lot of us.

Have you not heard me
say it, jamie?

I have.

And often.

The runt of the litter
he was,

But hard as nails...

And o'hara to the smallest
bone in his body.

A fine small man
was gerald...

Much as meself.
Ha ha ha.

I suppose you know

How he come by that grand
plantation of his, eh?

Playing poker with my money,
that's how.

And did I ever see a nickel
of it back? I did not.

Did he ever happen
to relate

How he come to leave ireland,
katie scarlett?

I would guess upwards of
about a hundred times.

Fled with a price
on his head, he did.

One blow of his fist,

And down went that english
landlord's rent agent,

Never to rise again
in this world.

A father to make a woman
proud, I should say.

And so I was...
And am.

Here's to a dutiful
and loving daughter, then.

May every man be blessed with one of
her like, and five would be better.

And I'll add a welcome
for cousin scarlett

To our hearts
and to our homes.

May she never be
out of the one,

Nor long absent
from the other.

I'm more touched than
I can find words to say.

Well, they're
lying about someplace.

I'm sure
you'll find them.

Right. Enough
of the feasting.

Let's have
some fiddlin'.

Oh, goodness, scarlett!

Are you all right,
darlin'?

Oh, get her a drink.

Oh, my dear.

Are you all right?

You simply must let us
summon a physician.

You're just being stubborn.

Stubborn.

I'm fine. I just
overdid it, that's all.

I'm recovering quite nicely
without the aid of a doctor.

The best thing
you could do for me

Would be to stop standing there
wringing your hands and just shoo.

If you feel the slightest
further bit indisposed,

Call for, uh...

Pansy!

Yes, and she'd send
for the doctor.

Shoo!

Shoo! Shoo!

Uh...

Uh, scarlett...

Shoo!

Uh, y-yes.

You're still looking kind
of purplish, miss scarlett.

Are you sure-

I'm not ill, pansy.

I'm...

Indisposed.

It must be suppertime.
Go get your supper.

Can I bring you
something up?

Not right now.
Maybe later.

Go and have your supper.

My beautiful,

Enchanting, magical
little...Indisposition.

You're just going to
have to go on being

The teeniest little bit
of a fib for a while.

I know you don't mind,

Considering
the good cause it's in.

The good cause being
just the exact right time

To introduce you
to your daddy.

I don't know when
the right time will be,

But I'll just have to
content myself

With imagining
the expression

On the handsome visage
of mr. Rhett butler

When he finds out I'm giving
him another sweet life...

For the one
we so tragically lost.

Oh, my darlin' little
indisposition,

I pray you're a girl.

Please, please,
be a girl.

Morning, boss.

Morning.

Hmm. I'd say
they're an improvement

Over the last lot.

And right to say it.

There's 10 more coming from
new york within the week.

And a thousand rounds.

That's all right,
then.

Will I make the usual
arrangements for the shipment?

You will.

From the look
of them,

I'd venture your hands
haven't done kitchen work

For quite some time,
scarlett, if ever.

They've done
far rougher things

Than shell peas
in their time, maureen.

Have they?

You don't look it.

Are you rich,
scarlett?

Well, I guess you could say
I'm pretty well off, yes.

So I says to jamie.

Carries herself rich,
I says.

Not to mention stopping
at the manse

Of mr. Pierre robillard, grand
mucky-muck of savannah hoi polloi.

Shall I tell you
how I got rich?

I think I'd enjoy
the telling.

Well...

So I took the inheritance
from my second husband-

If I'm late for lunch,

I must be in time
for supper.

Colum! Ye devil!

Not a word of warning.

I was hoping to catch you in the act.

Get away,
you terrible man.

If I wasn't a priest,

Nothing would save you
from my worldly attentions.

Blasphemer.
Now here's a surprise.

I'll bet me Sunday bonnet
on that.

She's the landlord's
daughter come for the rent.

Nothing of the kind.
She's scarlett o'hara butler,

Down from charleston to make the
acquaintance of her savannah kin,

And long overdue it was.

Scarlett, say hello to
father colum terence o'hara,

Here from ireland and
another one of your cousins,

May god have mercy on you.

Pleasure to make your acquaintance,
scarlett o'hara butler.

Well, bless me, father.

It's been a heck
of a long time

Since I've been
to confession.

Happy birthday, father.

Happy birthday,
grandfather.

Will you open your gifts
in the drawing room, father?

No.

Would you rather
we brought them in here?

I would not.

Where would you like to open
your presents, grandfather?

At a place
of my choosing,

At a time
of my choice,

And most certainly
in private.

I suppose, after some
considerable thought,

I might be able to imagine
something sadder

Than opening
birthday presents alone,

But I doubt it.

Scarlett, good heavens.

I was hoping to enjoy
your seeing what I got you.

Perhaps you will.

I mean me seeing you
seeing it.

I know what you mean.

See what you've done?

In absolute and certain
knowledge

That scarlett will not
make her own apologies,

No matter
how deeply owed,

May I beg your pardon

In her stead, father?

However much pauline
and I may regret

Having to return to
charleston tomorrow, we can,

And certainly you may

Take some modicum
of comfort in knowing

That scarlett will
be returning with us.

I'll be staying.

I beg your pardon?

I'll be staying on
for a bit.

What are you saying?

She says she'll be staying
a while! Are you deaf?

May one ask why,
scarlett?

I still haven't settled
with the sisters of mercy

About buying back
careen's share of tara,

And I'm not leaving savannah
till I do.

Besides, I'm just getting to
know my o'hara relatives here,

And I'm in no hurry to stop
knowing them so quick.

Well, if you remain
in savannah,

Where will you stay?

My o'hara kin would gladly
have me stay with them,

But they don't have
room for pansy,

And I can't get along
without pansy,

Of course,
I could go to a hotel.

There must be at least one
decent accommodation in savannah.

Or I could just
offer myself up

To the good graces
of grandfather robillard

And hope he might
provide shelter

For the relatively brief time
I'll be remaining.

Stay if you like.

It is a matter of supreme
indifference to me.

See?

I knew I'd be welcome.

Giddyup!

Whoa.

Good morning.

Rhett! Well,
good morning.

How are you this fine day, my dear?

Quite fine this fine day,
and yourself?

I couldn't be better.

I see you've made the
purchase of a new frock.

A frock? Why, no, it's-

There you go again,
teasing me, rhett butler.

How might I make amends?

I might find some
forgiveness in my heart

If you would offer me
a ride to the library.

If it isn't too terribly
bold of me to mention it,

I was sincerely
sorry to hear

Of the difficulties
between you and mrs. Butler.

Thank you.
As for boldness,

It happens to be a
quality I admire in women.

That's very unusual.

In my experience,

Which of course
has been quite limited,

I've observed that gentlemen are
generally somewhat discomposed

By any show of
forthrightness in a lady.

I think gentlemen
generally are.

I gather you don't count
yourself in that company?

In the company
of gentlemen

Or the company
of gentlemen

Discomposed by
forthright ladies?

Are you teasing me
again?

Why do you keep
doing that?

I seem unable to
resist it, don't I?

Maybe it's because of the
charming, delightful manner

With which
you respond to it.

Daddy says you're something
of a gambler.

I've played a hand of cards
now and again.

Mother doesn't like
daddy to gamble.

She says there's
too much chance of losing.

If you don't chance the losing,
you can't chance the winning.

Wish I could be that way
sometimes.

What way?

The way you said
about gambling.

Sometimes I wish I could throw
caution to the four winds,

Laugh at fate, let the
chips fall where they may.

Maybe you will one day.

I can't imagine it.

Sometimes
we need someone

To help our imaginations
along a bit.

Do you think so?

I've often known that
to be the case.

Always bearing in mind,
of course,

That you risk
the losing.

And chance the winning.

This is it.

What's the matter?

Maybe I best
wait outside.

Why?

Being a baptist?

Silly. It's not a church.
It's a convent for nuns.

Even if it was a church,

You'd be perfectly free
to go in.

Besides, they'd probably be
delighted to get their hands on you.

The decision, of course,

Lies in
the bishop's hands.

You can't accept my offer on your own?

Out of the question.

I have to talk
to the bishop now?

Certainly not.

I'll present your suggestion
to him on your behalf.

I wouldn't want to put
you to all that trouble.

I'd be more than happy
to speak to the bishop.

That would be impossible.

When will you talk
to him?

I have an appointment with
bishop flynn three days hence.

Perhaps the opportunity
will arise

For me to convey
your wishes to him.

He's irish?

County meath, I believe.

Could you mention to him
that my maiden name is o'hara?

Just as a note-

Personal curiosity
on my part, if I may?

Go right ahead.

Should the bishop look
favorably upon your request

And agree to exchange
our interest in tara

For your generous donation
to the sisters of mercy,

By my reckoning
that still leaves

The 1/3 share
in the property

Retained by
your other sister.

Suellen.

Suellen, yes.

Which would effectively
still deny you

The full ownership
you so passionately desire.

Your reckoning is right,
sister.

I'll just have to think
about that tomorrow.

Miss scarlett.

Oh, miss scarlett,
wake up.

He wants to see you right
this minute, he says.

What?

Who wants me?

Him.

What's the matter,
grandfather?

My breakfast
is unsatisfactory.

You got me out of bed
for that?

I got you out of bed
to do something about it.

What have I got to do
with your breakfast?

Send it back and tell them
to bring what you want.

You tell them.

What am I, some kind
of hired help?

Order
your own breakfast.

I'm going
back to bed.

The bed to which you believe
you are returning, young woman,

Belongs to me.

You occupy it only by
my grace and favor.

Is that a threat?

It is
a pertinent observation.

Maybe I'll talk to your
cook about her grits.

I wonder
if you have noticed

The portrait of your
grandmother robillard

In the drawing room.

I have. She was
a stunningly beautiful woman.

You favor her
remarkably.

Why, thank you,
grandfather.

Would that you might resemble
her in other respects.

What other respects?

She was a woman
of consummate grace,

Of great gentleness
and gentility.

I guess
I wasn't in school

The day
they handed those out.

Still...I suppose there
might be something to be said

For...Spirit.

There's folks
who think so.

I shouldn't wonder.

Grace, gentility
and all that-

Those are easy things
to take to.

I guess spirit takes some
getting used to by some

Before they can
appreciate it.

You may be right.

What precisely
is wrong

With the grits?

Where is
your parish?

I have no parish.

Who'd trust him
with one?

Only a fool
or the devil.

Are you
a missionary priest?

Laboring to ease the suffering
of the poor and bereft.

There's no one
like him for it.

You must travel
quite a bit.

Oh, wherever I'm called.

But I'm never long away
from ireland.

Do you have any influence with bishop flynn

Here in savannah?

A hard man,
the good bishop,

And not easily influenced.

Why do you ask?

He turned me down

About buying back
careen's share of tara.

I mentioned
me wanting to buy it.

Turned you down,
has he?

I can hardly
keep from crying

Every time
I think about it.

It would have meant
the world to me.

I wonder
if the bishop

Might be persuaded
otherwise.

By who?

Are you aware
there's a cathedral

Being erected
here in savannah?

No. Is there?

There is.

And the foreman
of all the bricklayers

Laboring on this
magnificent structure

Is a man called
tommy shannon,

A good friend
to yours truly

And has been
these many years.

He's also the husband
to my sister pidge.

Tommy could be persuaded
to let it be known

In an indirect manner

That a considerable slowdown in
the progress of the work might occur

Unless the bishop were to
reconsider his unreasonable attitude.

That's blackmail.

Of course,
if it doesn't sit well-

I didn't say
it didn't sit well.

Family...

It's a grand thing.

If I were your lawyer,
rhett,

This document would never
have been drawn up.

Why not?

Why? It flies in the face

Of every moral tenet that
we hold dear to our hearts.

My lawyer did mention

It was a somewhat unusual
action for an individual to take.

Somewhat unusual?

Heavens, rhett,

It is almost unheard of!

Maybe it should be
heard of more often.

Have you no respect whatsoever
for the sanctity of marriage?

I guess that'd depend
on the marriage, henry.

I can think of three
or four right now

I'd say don't have
much sanctity in them.

I'd have to add my own one
to that number.

Have you informed scarlett
of these intentions?

I would have if I could.

I don't know where she is.

I wish with all my heart

You would reconsider
this drastic action.

It so violates everything we believe in.

I'd appreciate it if you'd
forward those papers to your client

With the utmost dispatch,
henry.

Oh...

Poor scarlett.

If there's one thing
scarlett isn't,

It's poor.

You wanted to see me,
grandfather?

First I wish
to thank you

For your
birthday gift to me.

You're welcome.
I'm glad it fits.

I apologize for losing
my temper the other day

And the result of that.

I am 94 years old.

You sure don't look it.

Don't carry your remorse

To the extent
of desperate flattery.

Then I take it back.

I have no reasonable expectation
of living much longer.

I have a request to make
to you.

It is my wish that
you remain with me here

For the duration
of my life.

Remain with you?

I don't understand,
grandfather.

If you will remain in
this house as a chatelaine,

Attend to my comforts,

Conform with my wishes,

I am prepared
to designate you

As my sole heir.

My estate,
as you surely are aware,

Is not inconsiderable.

I'm a married woman,
grandfather.

I expect I shall be able to
tolerate your marital status.

I have responsibilities
and obligations.

I can't just
walk away from them.

And considering
all those considerations,

I'm sure you'll understand that
no matter how generous your offer

Or however much I'm
sincerely touched by it,

It would be out of the
question for me to accept.

As yet you do not know
how generous my offer is.

My estate
is presently valued

In excess of $500,000.

Half a million dollars?

And you my sole heir.

I didn't think any one person
had that much money.

You were mistaken.

Half a million dollars?

I agree it is a sum that
may bear certain repetition,

But we need not belabor
the point, scarlett.

You'd give me
all that money

If I stayed on here
till you passed on?

Under the conditions
of my needs and wishes.

Well,
what is your answer?

No.

My answer has to be no.

You refuse my proposal?

I'm afraid
I just have to.

<i>How dare you!</i>

How dare you turn up
your papist, peasant nose

At the opportunity
to become mistress

Of this great house

And attendant
to its master!

Even supposing
I was able to tolerate

Your intolerable manners-

Which I most definitely
would not-

The fact that I can
turn down your proposition

With hardly a twinge
of regret

Is some indication to me

That maybe I'm just
beginning to think

There might be more important
things than money after all.

I hope you don't mind me
saying this,

But I'm a bit confused.

I don't doubt
that maureen is as well.

Here's
a bill of divorcement

From the husband
you've told us

Is dying for your return
to his side in charleston.

There is a bit
of confusion there.

I fibbed.

Oh. Then
that's clarified.

Then this document's more
of a shock than a surprise.

No. It's as much one
as the other.

I never dreamed that-

I never imagined
rhett would...

What am I going to do?

There now, love.

It's him that's committed
the sin of divorce, not you.

And it's him who'll suffer
the wrath of god for it.

I'm pregnant.

Glory be to god.

Is the man
such a blackguard

As to divorce the woman carrying his child?

He doesn't know.

What are you saying,
scarlett?

We had a silly old quarrel.

We weren't
on speaking terms.

I was waiting for
the right time to tell him.

That'd be about now.

Never!

Never, never, never!

Divorce me?

Divorce me, will he?

There may come a day when he finds
out I've borne him another child,

But it'll be over my
wizened and lifeless body.

Your mind's
in too much turmoil

To be thinking clearly.

It's quite clear you won't be
able to keep the truth from him

Once your baby's come.

He could hear it
from someone else.

Far better
if it's from you.

If I'm far away,

There'll be
nobody to tell him.

What's on your mind,
scarlett?

Far away where?

When I was a girl,

My pa was forever going on
about ireland.

Maybe it's time I saw
what he was going on about.

You're for ireland,
then?

I'm for ireland.

It's the most breathtaking
country I've ever laid eyes on,

Just like pa
always described it.

We always thought he was
gilding the truth a bit.

No need to gild it,
is there?

I never thought I'd ever see a
place more beautiful than georgia.

Before the war,
of course.

It's like another world
altogether.

It's so...So ancient.

Nothing like ancient.
200 years maybe.

Fairly new.

I adore it.
I simply adore it.

Are we far from
uncle daniel's house?

Not far now.

Let me just
go over it.

There's grandmother, katie
scarlett, whose namesake I am.

Never, never did I imagine
I'd meet her face-to-face.

There's uncle daniel,
your pa,

And my pa's eldest brother,

And there's my cousin-
don't tell me-timothy

And his two sisters.

Jehoshaphat, how many cousins do I have?

That's kathleen
and, um, brigid.

Bridie.

Bridie.
Did I get them all?

That's them all
beneath that roof.

Will there be room
for me beneath it, too?

They'll see to that
well enough.

It's your possessions
I've some doubts about.

I guess I overdid it,

But I'll surely find a
place of my own very soon.

My clothes and I won't be a
bother to anyone, I promise.

I'm doubtful we'll be
able to locate you a house

To equal what you're
accustomed to, scarlett.

That's all right.
This is a new life.

I've got it.

Come on, get up.

Go on.
Everything out.

Don't put that
with the rest.

Come on, sean,
hurry up.

Stand back.

There's a bit
of trouble here.

I won't be long.

Let me see.

Stay in the coach.

Don't get out of it
now.

Come on, everything out.

Get the table.

Move along, paddy,
move along.

You, priest.

Back in your box
and get on your way.

I'll just have a word
with the woman, captain.

You wouldn't deny her a
bit of comfort, would you?

Don't fret.
Don't fret.

Please do something.

I'll send donnelly over for your things.

We'll find a place
for you.

Stand clear there.

Put your backs
into it, men!

Come on, lads!

Come on, boys, you're
supposed to be knocking...

Come on, harder!
Harder! Move it!

And again!

Swing it!

There she goes!

Harder!

Come on!

Torch it!

Stay in the coach, miss.

Colum, what in heaven's name
is happening?

They've destroyed
that poor woman's house.

It's an eviction,
scarlett.

She hasn't
the rent money.

Why did they destroy it?

So's no one
will live in it.

I don't understand.

The owner's english.

The english
own ireland.

You understand that,
don't you?

Sort of.

The owner doesn't want
to rent it anymore.

He's doing what they call
organizing his property.

First the rent is raised beyond
the possibility of being paid.

Then the house
is burnt down.

Then the land is set
to grazing cattle.

That's where
the profits are.

And that's ireland,
too.

No beauty about it
whatsoever.

I thought the driver's name was brendan.

I beg your pardon?

When you introduced me to the
driver, you called him brendan,

But that soldier
called him paddy.

We're all paddies to the english, scarlett.

It's comparable to your
despicable term "nigger."

I never used that word
in my life.

Pa would've flayed me raw.

I wasn't referring to you in particular.

I'm glad to hear it.

I must say, "paddy"
doesn't sound all that bad,

Not as bad
as that other.

You'd have to be irish.

Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Glory,
what was that?

In far too much of a hurry to be irish.

That'd be
one of them.

English?

You're getting
the lay of the land.

Whoa.

Milord.

Have you brung her?

Hello, everybody.

Have you
turned to stone,

Or are you going to give
the girl the welcome

She came halfway
around the world for?

Young katie
scarlett o'hara.

You honor my house,
and I bid you welcome.

You must be brigid.

Bridie.

You'll be stopping
in my room.

And...Tim.

That's right.

Hello, tim.

I'll get your bags.

That's katie scarlett.

Gerald's girl,
is it?

Come at last.

And I've lived
to see the day.

Glory be to god.

I got your note.

Evidently.

I came
as soon as I could.

Soon enough.

Did you miss me?

No doubt
you've missed this.

Here.

Have a look.

That's disgusting.

Take it away.

Get undressed.

Would you like a cup of tea, scarlett?

I'd love it.

Kathleen,
I got the feeling

My wardrobe might not
be appropriate

For living in ireland.

Your clothes
are beautiful, scarlett,

But you might be right
in their lack of fitness.

Would you like the lend
of something of mine?

Thank you, kathleen.
That's very generous of you,

But I think I better
do some shopping.

We could go into town.

I can't today.
Colum's coming by.

Is he? Where are you
off to, then?

He wouldn't tell me.

Adventuring, he says.

Well, come on, then.

We'll find you something more
fit for adventuring than that.

Are you going to tell me
where we're going

Before we get there?

I am not.

If you weren't a priest
and my cousin,

I could wheedle it out
of you.

Wouldn't I enjoy
the wheedling

Were I not your cousin
and a priest.

As for your priesthood,

I'll have to ask you
to do something

Which I guess will be
difficult for you.

And what might that be?

I have to tell
a little fib

And ask you
not to tell anybody

That's what it is.

A fib?

A little white lie
that won't hurt anybody.

I'm not asking you
to tell it.

I'm asking you...

I'm just asking you
not to say anything.

Will I choke on these words
I'm not to speak?

I don't see why.

I don't want to be a divorced
woman bearing a child.

How can you not be that

If it's what you are?

I can be a widow.

I'm going
to tell people

My husband
recently passed on.

What'll be
the point of that?

I don't want to be
a divorced woman

Bearing the child of a
husband that threw her over.

I simply
cannot bear it.

Nor will you have to.
Hush now.

You won't tell?

It'll be our secret.

Thank you, colum.
Thank you.

And there'll not be
a man or woman

That'll ever
wheedle it out of me.

This is tara.

Tara?

The first tara,

Whose memory your father
brought with him to america.

You see that row of
ancient stones over there?

That's all we've left

Of the great
banqueting hall

That was tara
10 centuries ago.

Here's where the o'haras
sung first, scarlett.

And the monaghans,
the mahoneys,

O'gormans, o'briens,

The donahues,
the carmodys,

The heroes.

All the heroes.

This was tara.

I feel so...Strange,
colum.

It does that to some.

What is it?

Time.

What are you up to?

Just something silly,
I guess.

If only pa could know
where I just stood.

He does, of course.

I wish I could
believe that.

Give it time.

What's this place?

Ballyhara.

All this land round
is known as ballyhara.

200 years ago,
it was our people's land.

O'hara land.

That's the big house
of ballyhara.

Does no one live in it?

No one lives there.
No one will.

What do you mean? Why?

There's
a dark history on it.

Tell me.

You've had enough folklore
for one day, darlin'.

We don't want
to overdo it, do we?

That's very sad.

We had no idea.

You have our deepest
condolences, dear scarlett.

Thank you.

What a tragedy.

The husband passed on
whose child you're carrying.

It would appear I wasn't
meant for marriage.

All my husbands
have died.

All?

You've been to the altar more than once?

Three times,
as a matter of fact.

And lost them,
every one.

Glory be to god,
it's like a curse.

As like as
makes no difference.

My first two husbands
were nothing like rhett.

Not to speak ill
of the dead,

But darling rhett...

What a man he was.

He could make a girl dizzy
just thinking about him.

My other two husbands
were fine and decent men,

But 10 of 'em couldn't
have made 1 rhett butler.

There's bashing
a tin pot,

And then
there's music.

I believe being divorced
by her husband

Would be one of the most
devastating things

That could happen
to a woman.

It depends on the woman.

As to scarlett, she can
do with being devastated.

Is it unseemly of me
to speak about it?

If it is, I'll-

Not a bit.
Everyone else is.

Heavens, I can't
bite my tongue any longer.

I just can't.

It was me.

I beg your pardon,
my dear?

Who saw her.

Scarlett in the hotel.

I saw scarlett with the man
I now know is ashley wilkes.

I saw them.

I was the one who told.

You don't say.

I've been driven
to distraction

Thinking that's the reason
you were divorcing her.

Because I told
that I saw scarlett.

Scarlett and I
have been at loggerheads

For some considerable
time now, anne.

You don't hate me, then?

I could fully understand
if you did,

Although
it would break my heart.

Oh, slow down, honey.

I appreciate you
mentioning it.

I've spent years
with a woman

Whose concept of the truth
was severely lackadaisical.

I find you a real
refreshing change.

You do?

Really?

You bet.

I feel like a great big hunk of solid rock

Has been lifted
off my back.

I'm quite pleased
to relieve you of it.

Still and all, weren't
you just perfectly furious

When you heard
about scarlett?

Scarlett hasn't always
played by the rules, anne,

But then,
neither have I.

But she's a woman.

She certainly is.

I've thought about what you
were saying this afternoon.

What did I say?

About rules.
Playing by the rules.

In regard to scarlett.

Uh-huh.

Well, I got the impression-

Maybe I'm mistaken,
I could be totally mistaken-

But I got the impression
you were suggesting

A woman has the same sort of
prerogatives to take as a man

By way of behaving.

Long as she can be
sensible about it.

About what?

Whatever comes of her
claiming the prerogative.

Like what you were saying
about gambling

And chancing losing?

And winning.

And winning. Yes.

A woman like that's
particularly attractive

To a certain kind
of man.

She is?

What do you think
about that?

About what?

About taking
your prerogative

And the risks
that come with it.

I guess I don't know
how I feel about it.

I don't know that I've got
a prerogative to take.

Sure, you do.

I do?

No question
about you having it.

Only a question
about you taking it.

Hello there.

Hello.

What are you doing?

Doing?
I'm looking around.

You're not irish.

I'm american.

From the southern
portion

Of that troubled
land, I take it.

Georgia.

Ah. You're among
the vanquished

In the recent unpleasantness
between the states.

We lost the war, mister.

Nobody vanquished us.

I mean no offense,
mrs...

Butler.
My full name

And the one I prefer to go by
is scarlett o'hara butler.

I'm getting a crick in
my neck looking at you.

In america, a gentleman
dismounts when addressing a lady.

He also generally
introduces himself

Unless he has some nefarious
reason not to do so.

Fenton.

Fenton what?

Actually,
I'm the earl of fenton.

That's some magnificent
piece of horseflesh

You're riding there,
earl.

You know something
of horses, do you?

More than something.

This isn't mine.
It belongs to my uncle.

I'll be getting myself
a proper horse real soon.

Yes. I should say
that might be advisable.

This land once belonged
to my family, the o'haras.

You don't say.

Maybe some of it
will again.

And how might that
come about?

It's called
ballyhara.

Yes, I know.

Do you happen
to know who owns it?

As a matter of fact, I do.

Why do you ask?

Just curious.

How much land
goes with it?

1,200 acres.

That's a nice piece
of property.

It's a wreck of a place.

Have you been inside?

I was just looking
for a way in.

Follow me.

Must've been a grand house

Before it was left
to go to wrack and ruin.

Do you know anything of
the history of ballyhara?

I get the impression
something unpleasant happened,

But I don't know what.

It was built by
an englishman, of course.

The house passed from
generation to generation

Until the time
of the famine.

Are you familiar with
the famine here in ireland?

My pa told us
all about it.

The then lord
of ballyhara

Was unable, it seems,

To bear the horrors
of starvation and death.

He bought a ship

To provide free passage
to america for his tenants,

Their families,

Anyone who cared
to take advantage

Of his pity and largess.

Many did.

The exact number
was never known,

Surely in the hundreds,

But they all drowned
when the ship went down

In the first heavy sea
encountered.

Oh, my lord.

Not long after,

The lord of ballyhara
was found in the stable,

Bound hand and foot
and hung from a rafter.

The act, of course,

Of a handful of demented
paddies bound on revenge.

Of course, there was
retribution for the murder.

Five men from the village

Were chosen at random
and hanged.

Hanged? By who?

By the legal
representatives

Of the british crown,
of course.

That was all
30 years ago.

The house hasn't
been occupied since.

The local witchery
has it, inevitably,

That the house
is haunted.

Well, considering
that story,

If any place had a right
to be haunted,

I guess it would be ballyhara.

And should we have a chance
to meet again after today,

Don't you dare use the word
paddy in my presence again.

Have I encountered
a fenian heart

In an american
breast, then?

A what?

The word's
unfamiliar to you?

Fenian?

The fenian brotherhood,

A secret irish society

Dedicated to the violent
and bloody overthrow

Of british rule
in ireland,

Knowing full well the mayhem
inherent in that hopeless wish.

I don't want anything
to do with politics.

That's very wise
of you.

Ghosts or no ghosts,

I'd still like to
speak to the owner.

You are.

The man who was hanged
was my father.

May I offer you
some lunch, mrs. Butler?

We aren't far
from fenton hall.

The way it looks now
reminds me of our homes

After the yankees
passed through,

Except the state
ballyhara's in

Is the result of
nothing more than neglect.

Anyone can see
what a beautiful place

It must have been once.

I know how you feel
about the english,

But they sure know how
to build houses.

What's this I hear
about it being haunted?

Has anyone actually seen
a ghost at ballyhara?

Now I know what's different
about supper tonight-

I'm the only one talking.
What's going on?

Something happened?

Did somebody die?

Are we going
to sit here like lumps

Or will we have it out?

You're known
to have been consorting

With the master of
fenton hall today, scarlett.

Consorting?

What's that supposed to mean, consorting?

I met him by accident at ballyhara,

And he invited me
home for lunch.

How did you
know about it?

Scarlett, there's
nothing happens here

That the whole county
doesn't know about

By the fall of dark.

Best to keep it in mind
for future referral.

Now, look here.

I'm real fond
of all of you,

And I have
the greatest respect

For your feelings
about the english.

But I have
a slight objection

About being told
who I can talk to.

And right she is.

Miss scarlett's got nothing
to do with our troubles.

Can she be among us

And have nothing
to do with 'em?

It's her decision
to make.

Stop talking about me as
though I were somewhere else.

But you're not somewhere else, darlin',

And that's
the point of it.

I don't care
about politics.

Politics! Is it politics
you call it, woman?

Father!

Nothing was e'er heard
any the better for shouting.

Yes, that's what
I call it.

I've seen
what it can do.

From fort sumter
to the terrible day

General lee handed
over his sword

At appomattox
courthouse.

And millions dead
between.

And ruination
and despair.

I've had
my bellyful,

And I'll have
no more!

I'm sorry for shouting.

Call it politics if
that's your need, scarlett,

But what we're about here
is human suffering.

After the hanging
and the murders,

Fenton's mother took
him and his sister away

To live in England.

That's still
his real home place.

But five years
or so ago,

He bought fenton hall,
as he came to call it.

He passes a fair bit
of time there.

I get the impression
he's not well liked.

No more or less
than the rest of 'em,

But you shouldn't encourage
an association with him.

God's nightgown!
You, too?

I'm not encouraging
anything with him.

All's well, then.

Home, sweet home...

Should you choose
to call it that.

There's a
sleeping chamber there.

It could do with a few
more sticks of furniture.

Will it do,
do you think?

It'll do just fine, colum.

Now, where can I buy
a good horse and a trap?

Whoa.

Evening.

You're getting what?

It's my duty
to marry her, belle.

Jumping jones!
You're gonna tell me

You got that girl
in the family way?

Of course not.

Then what do you mean,
it's your duty?

I told you.
I compromised her.

You didn't force yourself
on her, did you?

You know better
than to ask that.

I sure do,
and I apologize.

Is she ragging on you

To make
an honest woman of her?

Maybe she's making
an honest man of me.

Oh, rhett...

Gonna be terrible
for your reputation

If that ever gets around.

Terrible.

They're all just
adorable, mrs. Scanlon.

This one especially.

When's the baby
coming?

November.

Ladies?

Good morning, father.

Colum.

Is she buying out
the shop?

Just baby stuff thus far,
but I'm still hoping.

I'm only pulling your leg.

I should hope so

After what I bought for
myself not two weeks ago.

No one could complain of
your costume, mrs. Butler.

I can't decide.
I'll take them all.

And there's
the proof of it.

Come on.
I need your help.

Good morning, ma'am.

How much will you take
for ballyhara?

Are you quite serious?

Let's find out.

Have you heard?

Have you heard?

Heard what?

It's...

Ballyhara!

Have you heard?

The o'hara woman has just
made purchase of ballyhara

And a thousand acres
with it!

Have you been doing your
drinking elsewhere today?

O'brien must've been talking
to the little people again.

But it's the truth!

I've had it from the lips
of father colum himself!

Would you call him
a liar?

If you're
pulling our legs,

We'll hang you from the
rafters by both of yours.

May I be struck dead

If I'm not
telling the truth.

I believe he is.

And there's
plenty of work

For every man jack
as wants it,

Putting it back
to its former state.

And farms to be had

At rents
that'll never rise!

That's her promise.

Well, here's to
scarlett o'hara, then.

God bless her rare soul

Who's took back
what was took from us

And made it irish
once more!

Yay! Yay! Yay!

Now's as good a time
as any.

Consider the risk
in trusting her.

Where's the risk,
man?

Do you supposed she'll
go running to the barracks

Hollering sedition?

There's no
chance of that.

She might turn us down.

What do you think, colum?

I think the risk's
more hers than ours.

How do you figure that?

Were she to be
discovered helping us...

She'd know
that risk.

It's for her
to decide.

I say now's the time.

Are you having relations
with the o'hara woman?

Don't be impertinent.

I was only wondering.

You're not here to wonder.

There's some
whispering it about

As to you and her.

Be quiet.

I want to go now.

Not yet.

No! Let me go!

Let me go!

Come on, move it.

We're doing it!

What are you doing?

What's going on here?

Scarlett,
we're being evicted!

Evicted?
What the devil for?

Where's uncle daniel
and tim?

Someone's gone
to get them.

I needn't inquire
as to your identity.

I presume
you're the american woman.

You presume right.

What are you doing
to these people?

I'm executing an order

On behalf of
her majesty's government

For the eviction of persons
resident on this property

For their having fallen
in arrears on the rent.

Now, stand aside,
please, miss.

Are you in arrears,
kathleen?

God help us,
we are, scarlett.

How much?

I beg your pardon?

It's their pardon
you should be begging.

How much in arrears
are they?

Constable?

7 pounds, 8 shillings, 9 pence.

Well, do you want it,
or don't you?

I don't have 9 pence.
You can keep the change.

By his glory be
to god,

But doesn't she
just take the cake?

I'll pay you back
every penny.

I swear it
on my father's grave.

Why didn't you tell me
you needed money?

I'd have helped you.

I'll not take charity,
scarlett.

It's family, uncle daniel.

There's no charity
in family.

Nevertheless,
every penny.

All right, then.

Maybe we can make
some kind of an arrangement.

What would that be?

Will you come farm
a piece of my land?

The rent will be better,

Not only for you.

For anyone who comes
as tenant at ballyhara.

Put the difference
between your rent here

And the rent there
toward paying me back.

It's fine land
up there.

It's o'hara land.

Every penny, mind.

And a bit more.

I didn't have
the exact change.

Daniel,
coming up.

I got that one.

There she goes.

Ready?

Hurry up.

Want some lunch?

I just come by

To tell you I'll be
away for a while.

Away? Where?

America.

Boston, philadelphia.

Don't be gone too long.

Only as long
as is needed.

It's coming along.

Not fast enough.

Fast is a word

You'll find
mysteriously absent

From the irish
vocabulary, darlin'.

You'll be needing help running
a house the size of this.

I've taken the liberty
of arranging that for you.

Rosaleen fitzpatrick's
her name.

Formerly head housekeeper on
an estate by trim, near laracor.

I'm much obliged,
colum.

I hadn't thought
of that.

I'll have her drop by
at your convenience.

I have other news as well.

I've had a letter from
savannah from tommy shannon,

The works foreman on the new
cathedral being built there.

It concerns your tara.

It's about time.
What's the news?

Faced with a retarded pace
of work on the cathedral,

As was hinted
as a possibility by tommy,

The bishop
reconsidered your proposal

To buy back
your sister's share of tara

And will enter into
negotiations on a fair price.

Hallelujah.

Won't all this alter
your plans somewhat?

How?

You seem to be amassing

A considerable amount
of property.

Colum,
what we're standing on

Was here
a million years ago.

How can anyone have too much of
anything that lasts that long?

Never thought of it
quite like that,

But I don't know of any
but you who would.

You'll be needing
considerable staff, of course.

I don't know about
considerable.

Just someone
to run the place,

And I'm assuming that'll
be you, mrs. Fitzpatrick.

I'll only be using
a few rooms at first.

When'll the child
be coming?

I judge October
or thereabouts.

That's what I'm figuring on
around late October.

They've got to finish up

Enough for me
to move in before then.

Why is that?

I want my baby
to be born here.

You'll be needing
a steward

To manage the butler,
the footmen, and the like,

And a head stableman
to supervise the grooms.

How many horses have you
in mind to have?

I haven't gotten around to
thinking about horses yet.

I'm late in expressing
my pleasure

At meeting you and
being in your employ.

It would be an honor to be
housekeeper for the o'hara.

Beg your pardon?

I say I'll be honored being
housekeeper for the o'hara.

<i>The o'hara?
What do you mean?</i>

Are you not aware, then?

You're called
the o'hara now,

Head of the family o'hara
and all its branches.

A rare grace it is,
you being a woman.

Hasn't been a female
borne the title

In over 100 years or more.

Ye gods!
What do I have to do?

Some will come to you

With various troubles
now and again.

There'll be the odd
squabble amongst families

That might be needing
your attention.

There may be occasional
intercessions with the landlord

Asked of you.

Nothing that
you're not equal to,

From what I've heard
of you thus far.

Well, I'll do my best,

But what I'd be equal to
right now is lunch.

Let's drop into the pub.

Well, now...

Women are rare enough
in carney's, mrs. Butler,

And never unescorted.

But I'm the o'hara.

Afternoon.

Here's to ya!

God bless the o'hara!

You hurt me.

Get dressed.

Are you done with me
for this evening,

Lord fenton, sir?

Get dressed.

You hurt me.

God bless all here.

Colum.

Whoa.

Colum.

You're back.

How are you?

Welcome.

I missed you so.

So how was boston?

And philadelphia,
was it?

Quite civilized,
I'm pleased to report.

You sure travel far afield to save souls.

If this little creature was kicking
me like that from the outset,

I'd be black and blue.

Poor lamb.

How much longer?

About three weeks,
I reckon.

Will you have your wish
as to the birthplace?

I will. The whole house isn't finished yet,

But enough so's I'll have my
baby 'neath ballyhara's roof.

Be sure to stay beneath it
the night of allhallows eve.

Why? What's that?

The same as
your Halloween,

Though we take it more
seriously than you do.

It's coming
a week Saturday.

Stay in your house with
your doors shut tight.

That's when all the goblins and ghosts

And spirits from
all the times come out,

Some carrying their
heads beneath their arms

And all other
unnatural things.

Colum.

Oh, well.

Perhaps you're not
quite irish enough yet.

There's some plaster
needed on the walls,

But with a good fire in the
hearth and cheerful curtains,

The room will afford
quite reasonable comfort.

And there's
a surprise for you.

We found it
in the attic.

Sweet mercy,
what is it?

It's a state bed,

Probably made specially for
the viceroy's visit years ago.

Who's that?

The head of the government
in ireland.

I've ordered
a comfy mattress.

I could sleep in this

And never hit
the same spot twice.

The bed wants
more than one in it.

Mrs. Fitzpatrick, whatever
are you suggesting?

Ooh!

I trust there's been no
signs of ghosts as yet.

Not yet.

They're probably waiting
till I get settled in

Before they make
their presence known.

Do you believe
in ghosts?

I don't believe in them,
but I'm scared of them.

Have you a preference?

I'm hoping for a girl.

It would appear you haven't
long to wait before you know.

It's banging on the gates, all right.

It must be
quite difficult,

Widowed
and bearing a child.

I would've preferred it
otherwise.

I would've
been by sooner,

But I'm just back
from dublin.

It's a beautiful city.

You must see it.

I have every intention
of seeing it.

Perhaps I can be
your guide and escort.

You might care to meet
some fashionable people,

I dare say,
even the viceroy.

Does it sound appealing?

I have to admit
it does.

I could benefit
from some relief

From all the muck I've been
slogging through of late.

But there's somebody else
I've got to meet first, though.

Of course.

In due time.

In due time,
I just might.

I'll take
your horse, father.

Throw another log
on the fire.

Colum, what are you doing
out on a night like this?

I was halfway here
when the storm broke.

It was easier
to keep coming.

Who but a priest would
venture out on allhallows eve?

You're in time
for supper.

I was hoping
I might be.

This came in the adamstown
post for you today.

I'm expecting something
from my lawyer in atlanta.

This isn't it,
though.

It's from an aunt
in charleston.

Would you lay another place for colum?

I'll just go make myself more presentable.

Oh, god.

The baby.

Ohh!

Mrs. Fitzpatrick!

Mrs. Fitz!

It's coming!

It's coming!

I'll get the doctor.

He's too far,
and there isn't the time.

Something's not natural.
There's blood.

I can't vouch for myself
to do it, colum.

I'll fetch someone
who will.

Nobody will venture out
on allhallows eve.

Perhaps I'll get someone to
come under special protection.

Go on, now!

Hyah!

Whoa!

Aah! Aah!

No!

Aah!

It'll be all right,
darlin', shush.

Shush, darlin'.

No!

Shush, shush, shush.

No!

It'll be all right.

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!
