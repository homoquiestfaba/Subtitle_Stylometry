[wind gusting]

[sign creaking]

[birds singing]

[typewriter dings]

[dog barking in distance]

[Mank straining]
It's all right. I've got this. I'm good.

[horse neighs in distance]
[Mank grunts]


[Mank sighs]

I had them set you up out here
so you wouldn't feel quite so confined.

The ladies will scandalize
the neighborhood

by occupying both bedrooms.

I will be staying in town
at a bucolic spa called,

if you can believe it, the Shoulder Arms.

I will do my editing there.

As you know,

Fraulein Freda is not only
a nurse and physical therapist,

she studied nutrition
back in the old country.

<i>- Ja, liebes FrÃ¤ulein?
Jawohl, Herr Houseman.</i>

It's a dry house.

The owner of the ranch
doesn't permit alcohol.

[Mank grunts]
[Houseman] But you're from Pennsylvania.

You're no doubt used to it.


Set it here, please.

And, uh, careful.

Careful. Thank you.
[Mank sighs]

[door closes]

Observe.
[button clicks]

Naturally,
you'll do your damnedest to get at it.

By the time you finish the first draft,
which is to say, in 90 days,

you should be a world-class sprinter.

Rita, come in here, will you?

This is Mrs. Alexander.

She types 100 perfect words a minute
and takes dictation like a clairvoyant.

Rita Alexander, Herman Mankiewicz.

How do you do, Mr. Mankiewicz?

Uh, that's a big question.

Well, since you like working nights,
Rita here runs on London time.

Her husband
is one of our bold lads in the RAF.

Fliesâ€¦ What is it, Rita? Spitfires?
Hurricanes.

My sympathy and prayers.
I beg your pardon?

Given the speed, climb, and turning radius
of the Messerschmitt Bf 109...

I hope we won't need your sympathy,
Mr. Mankiewicz.

We'll do the praying and the fighting.

Keep him to date on our progress.

We're expecting great things.

What is it the writer says?
"Tell the story you know."

[telephone ringing]
[Rita] Hmm.

I don't know that writer.

Hello.
[woman speaking on phone]

Yes. Yes, he's right here.

Well, you should have everything.
If I've forgotten, there's a clipboard.

Yes? Hello?
They're getting him.

Our wunderkind
does have the gift of theatrical timing.

Orson, hello. We just got in.
[Welles speaking indistinctly on phone]

Oh.

[Mank grunts and sighs]

Hello.
[Welles] <i>Mank!</i>

Houseman tells me
we have you just where we want you.


How's the leg?
"Thigh bone's connected to the hip bone."

<i>Excellent.</i>

Ready and willing
to hunt the great white whale?

Just call me Ahab.

I understand we've 90 days.



I used to do it in five for you
at the Mercury. This is leisurely.

Sixty days, and then we can noodle.
Nothing like a good noodle.

Uh, is the reason you lopped 30 days
to run it past the RKO legal?

<i>I have final cut, final everything.</i>

<i>There are no studio notes.</i>

We'll have no one but ourselves to blame.

[Mank] <i>Sixty days and a noodle.</i>
[man] Mr. Welles, we're ready.

Gotta run.
I'm doing tests for <i>Heart of Darkness.</i>

Oh, little that, lesser Joe Conrad.

If anyone should ask,
tell 'em you're adapting.

<i>this sun-bleached sewer here, my friend.</i>

Break wind at Hollywood and Vine,

and a producer in Santa Monica
reports a ruptured main.

<i>I don't know this burgh, not yet.</i>

<i>I'm toiling with you in spirit, Mank.
And I don't hear any typing.</i>

[hangs up]

No notes.

And then he turns 24.


[typewriter dings]

[Mank grunts]
[woman] Uh-uh.

Let me take off these clothes.

just as I achieved perfect equilibrium.

I won't work
with half the producers on the lot,

and the other half won't work with me.

What's this, a racing form?

You stop reading, you stop learning.
[chuckles]

Hold still.

Lay back.


Cigarette, please.

Hermie, if a match gets
anywhere near your breath,

you'll burst into flames.

Even the dog's name is awful.

Sounds like a Japanese houseboy.

You mark my words, Sara.

<i>The Wizard of Oz</i>
is gonna sink that studio.

Sleep. You're driving
to New York tomorrow.

when you used to take the train

from back East?

I'd sneak aboard in Albuquerque
and climb into your compartment naked.

I also remember
how I spent my honeymoon in Berlin,

with hookers running up and down
the stairs all night

because my dashing correspondent
couldn't afford a nice hotel.

Weren't those the days?

Yeah, yeah,
and the nights weren't bad either.

[Mank] Schnutz.
For the last time, what?

What year is it?
Hermanâ€¦

I should have done something by now.
Oh, Hermieâ€¦

Give me a sign, oh, Lord.

I am as your servant Moses,
though I won't work half as cheap.

Go to sleep, meshuggener.

[Mank] Schnutz?
What?

Why do you put up with me?


That bush in the front yard,

if it catches fire tonight,
you will let me know? [grunts]

you know all kinds of things.

Iambic pentameter,
the words of the great poets.

What about the way she signed it?
"Always, Ethel." [chuckles]

Can you beat that?
Not just "Ethel." "Always, Ethel."

Tommy, if we can find civilization
by sundown,

I hope to climb out of this crate
and into a cold martini.

She's not the kind to use "always"
if she didn't mean it.

If she meant just "Ethel,"
she'd write just "Ethel," not "always."

Wouldn't you think?
Uh, the road, Tommy.

I know.

You read it and see what I mean.

[tires squeal]
[loud crash]


[footsteps echoing]

[unsettling music playing]


Of course it is.
[Welles] I think it's time we talked.

I'm all ears.

[Welles's laughter echoing]


now a memory of what once was.

Alone in his unfinished,
already decaying pleasure palace,

aloof, seldom visited, never photographed,

we see an old man in a robe,
smoking a pipe,

sitting alone by his poolâ€¦

[fly buzzing]
[Mank grunts]

â€¦um, uh,
discarded pages scattered at his feet.

Narrator,

"An emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire,

vainly attempting to sway, as he once did,

the destinies of a nation

which had long since ceased to listen
to himâ€¦"

No. "Had ceased to trust him."

We see through trees as an aide
pushes this old man in a wheelchair

across neatly groomed lawns.

Narrator, "There, last month,

as it must to all men, death came to..."

[thwacks]
[chuckles]

Let's have that cuppa, Mrs. A.
Oh.

I know who it is.
[Mank chuckles softly]


What makes you think
it's meant to be anybody?

Oh, come, now.

Everyone in the English-speaking world
will recognize him instantly.

Exactly what he would say.

Did you know the man?
Maybe.

I used to.

You wrote for one of his papers?
Oh, no, praise God.

I met him after he started bankrolling
his girlfriend's pictures.

You knew Marion Davies?

If anyone did.
Really?

What's she like?

Why is it when you scratch
a prim, starchy English schoolgirl,

you get a swooning moving-picture fan

who has forgotten all she ever learned
about the Battle of Hastings?

Hastings. 14 October 1066,

ten centigrade.

{\an8}[typewriter dings]

[upbeat music playing]

[studio bell rings]

[animal snarls]

[imperceptible conversation]


[toilet flushing]

Sorry.
Somebody told me Mankiewicz was in here.

He is. I'm the promising brother, Joe.

I didn't know Herman had a brother.
Neither does anyone else.

Let me guess.

"There are millions to be made,

and your only competition
is idiots," stop.

How did you know?

I hate to tell you,
anyone who can rub three words together

and make a sentence gets one.

Come on.

It's after lunch, and we're on a deadline.
He may be busy.

I promise I won't be a bother.
Not exactly what I meant.

[men exclaiming]

Come on! Hey.
You know I'm good for it.

Fellas.
Shh. These are high stakes.

[coin flipping]

[man 1] Go on.

[laughing] Ooh, tails! That's it!
God damn it!

[man 2] Oh, Mank!
All right. Double or nothing.

This time, banjo-eyed son of a bitch,
let it hit the floor.

"Banjo-eyed."
[man 1] Son of a bitch?

[man 2] Mank once bet me a five-spot

to see how long it would take
a falling leaf to hit the ground.

Had to go to management to cover it.
For five bucks?

Five thousand.


Heads, you bastard!


[man 3] Oh, Mank!
[group chuckles]

[man 1] Ooh! Pleasure doing business
with you, gentlemen.

Hey, Charlie.

Yeah. You all remember
the Algonquin cabin boy, Charlie Lederer,

a poor
but somewhat talented magazine writer,

come West to join our merry band.

Well, you know most everyone.
Mr. Kaufman.

George is fine, kid.

Mr. Perelman.
Nice to meet you, son.

Do you prefer Sidney or SJ?

Uh, he takes what he gets.
The great Charles MacArthur.


My resident jack-of-all-trades,
Shelly Metcalf.

Hey, kid.
Mr. Metcalf.

Oh, save the "mister" for the anointed.

And last, not yet among them,
my brother Joe.

Have Cyclone say, "I don't mind the heat
as much as I do the humanity."

And the one and only Ben Hecht.

Have you been laid yet?

[all snickering]

Do you have to think about that?

[telephone ringing]

Hello.

Yeah. Right away.

Selznick, everyone. Five minutes.

in the well-known nick.

Just in time for a story conference
with the great David O.

Once more unto the breachâ€¦
[Kaufman] Breach? Hell, unto the wireâ€¦

Without a net.

Keep your mouth shut
and watch us for your cue, okay?

Cue?
[Mank sighs]

What I wouldn't give
to see that in a tight sweater.

Herm, can I use that?

I need a status report. Boys, come on in.

Ah, make yourselves at home.

Now, you all know Joe von Sternberg.

You wanted 72 hours, you got 72 hours.
Tell us what you have so far.

Ben, why don't you start?
Well, this was tough, David.

In the beginning,
we couldn't agree on an approach.

Really? And why was that?

Well, we see a different kind
of Paramount picture.


<i>Frankenstein</i> and <i>The Wolf Man</i>
all rolled into one, only...

I don't make cheap horror pictures,
Universal does.

Uh, this is different.
This is about something.

Okayâ€¦

Sidney.

Imagine a mad scientist,

touring the boonies
with a mechanical freak he's fabricated.

Now, what does he mean, "fabricated"?

And displays it to superstitious hayseeds
in a giant, silk-lined casket

for the price of admission.

But every full moon, the monster awakens
and raises unholy hell with the villagers.

Give it a Eastern European look,

men in leather shorts,
gals in tattered peasant blouses.

Let me guess. They think it's the devil?
Villagers always think it's the devil.

And the scientist and his creation
are forced to flee

during a raging electrical storm.

Flee from outraged peasantsâ€¦

Who pursue them <i>mit</i> torchesâ€¦

Overturn their creaky wagonâ€¦

And set fire to it.

Tell him about the finale, Charlie.

Oh.

Wellâ€¦

The rain turns to sleet,

puts out the fire,
and entombs the monster in solid ice.

While nearby, an old priest weeps.

Hmm. A weeping priest?

Thunder, lightning, blood, fire, religionâ€¦

All in one film?

And with an unseasonal thawâ€¦

A sequel.

I thought you said this was
about something, this was different.

Plus, the ominous futility
of man playing God.

The Faustian bargain of life everlasting.

And the triumph of the human spirit

over the beast incarnate
in our far-too-solid flesh.

It's director-proof.

Joe.

B picture.
It's not for Joe.

Boys, this is serious. We need your help.

We've got to get people
into theaters, butâ€¦

How?

Show movies in the streets.
[clicks tongue]

[energetic music playing]

You okay, Charlie?

Taken care of this weekend?

I'm going to see my aunt.
Oh, that sounds like fun.

You obviously don't know my aunt.
If you're not doing anything, come along.

Careful, I just might.

Glendale station at 7:00.
Bring Sara if you like.

Who?
Sara, isn't that your wife?

Oh, you mean Poor Sara.

No, she and the kids are back East.

[car horn tooting]

[crowd clamoring]


Herman.

Herman!
[Mank slurring] Charlie!

[woman screaming]
[gasps]

[birds singing outside]

[Mank grunts softly]


[man whistling]

[exhales, sniffles]

[birds squawking]

[woman screaming]

[indistinct chatter]

[men vocalizing and chanting]

[woman continues screaming]


[indistinct chatter]

[big band music playing on phonograph]

What is Mank doing here?

Who?
Herman Mankiewicz.

Do I know him?
He wrote one of our Lon Chaneys.

Ah.
Mank!

Thalberg, the boy genius.
I am shocked to see you here.

I'd be shocked to see me here, too,
Irving, if only I knew where here was.

You wrote one of our Lon Chaneys.
[Mank] Among many.

Pictures?
Writers.

At MGM, movies are a team sport.
Which may be why I'm at Paramount.

Since when don't Paramount
use writers by the truckload?

But all at once, not in relays.

Helps spread the blame around.

You remember our chairman, Louis B. Mayer?

By reputation only.

Long night?
A short one. Plagued by spirits.

A hell of a way to spend
the Sabbath, fellas.

Here in support of a friend.

His leading lady is making
a mid-career adjustment.

Ah, I'm on my way over.
Any notes from the oversight tent?

Who was that again?
Just a writer.

Slumming on a Saturday, Mr. Metcalf?

No, sir, helping out on B camera.

It's a home movie,
but his idea of a home movie.

I know you.


We met at John Gilbert's birthday.
You're Herman Mankiewicz.

Guilty.

And I remember you, Miss Davies.

Regaling us with stories
about dodging trolley cars in Brooklyn.

Your Flatbush was showing.
[gasps]

You fractured Wally Beery's wrist
Indian wrestling.

Admittedly, a lucky break.

Boy, was he surprised.
You're stronger than you look.

And from what I understand,
you're smarter.

That was a compliment.

See what I mean?
[Marion laughing] You are interesting.

I need a favor,

but you're gonna have to promise
you won't laugh.

Given the state of the world,
a tall order.

You're gonna. I just know you are.

I have got such a hangover right now,
there's just a fighting chance I won't.

I'm being burned at the stake,
and I am dying for a ciggie-boo.

[both laugh]
There. God's punishing you.

[wood creaking]

Watch those stairs. They're treacherous.

Every moment of my life is treacherous.

Any last words?

Welcome to San Simeon.

I've written worse.

[Marion] You've never seen it?
No, but George Bernard Shaw was right.

How's that?

"It's what God might've built
had he had the money."

Well, as they say in the Bronx,
"Make yourself to home," Mr. Mankiewicz.

Or shall I call you Herman?
No. Please, call me Mank.

Good morning, Charles.
Charlie.

Aunt Marion. Mank.
[Marion] You sleep well?

Until your rather dramatic wake-up call.

This is all Pops's idea.
He wants me ready to take on the talkies.


Riders, ready!

Rolling!

Speed.
[crew member 1] Speed! Action!

[guns firing]

[energetic instrumental music playing]

Help! Please! Someone save me!

[crew member 2 coughs]

[crew member 3] Cut!


[horse whinnies]

but we have to call him Mank.

Mankiewicz?

Herman Mankiewicz,
New York playwright and drama critic?

Turned humble screenwriter, Mr. Hearst.

Mr. Mankiewicz.

Pictures that talk are the future.

They're gonna need people who honor words,
give them voice.

There's a golden age coming
when all the world will be a stage,

and you, perhaps, their Shakespeare.


you'd be that keenly interested
in the honoring of words.

[Marion laughs]
What's so funny?

I'm just surprised
that a vaunted muckraker like yourself

sees Hollywood's future
as such a shiny penny.


Times are changing, Mr. Mankiewicz,

and I'm not just referring
to this Depression.

All that bother.


picture-makers are gonna have
to service this new entertainment.

I intend to make pictures
with the help of real literary minds.

Mm, I support that.

Instead, what do most studios give us?
Gangster flicks, zanies.


Now, how many gangsters
do Americans meet in a lifetime?

How many families
are like the Marx Brothers?

You mean besides my own?

[Hearst laughs]

Very good. Have him seated next to me.

[energetic music resumes playing]

Miss Davies, Mr. Hearst would like
Mr. Mankiewicz seated

to his left at dinner.

Oh, Pops likes you.

[Mank sighs deeply]

Why is it when Houseman edits,

everyone ends up speaking
like a constipated Oxford don?

[telephone rings]

Hello?
[indistinct chatter on phone]

Yes, he is. No, not at all.

Please hold on. It's Poor Sa... [gasps]

I'm sorry. It's your wife.

Schnutz.
[Sara] <i>I heard that.</i>

<i>Hermie,</i>

Joe called four times
in the last three days.

He wants your number up there.
[Mank] <i>So give it to him.</i>

[clattering]
Knock it off!

[children laughing]

The boys are remodeling.

<i>He seemed concerned about something.
Is everything okay?</i>

If I could swim, I'd be doing swimmingly.

And don't mind Joe.

He's a worrisome old woman in disguise.
Well, he wants to offer you work.

Baby Joe offering me?

give him this number, Schnutz.

I've gotta run. Kiss the offspring.
[kisses]

[in British accent] I sayâ€¦

A letter from the gallant "leftenant"?

[in normal voice] Now, let's hope
it makes more sense than the last.

Fighters off the decks
of aircraft carriers.

Whoever had that idea?
It's not good?


German U-boats
are starting to hunt in packs,

and a Stuka dive-bomber can drop one
down your stack from 500 feet.

[in British accent] What's our
valiant laddie have to say for the cause...

[door opens]

It's not from her husband.

His ship's been sunk off Norway.

Presumed lost at sea.


Always the smartest guy in the room.


[jazz music playing on radio]

[woman singing on radio]

[owl hooting outside]

You're right, of course.

Aircraft carriers are a shitty idea,
but I don't appreciate the callousness.

I expect more of you.

"Presumed" means they don't know,
so I choose to believe he's alive untilâ€¦

Mank.

Mank!

Mr. Mankiewicz?
[thuds]

He's all right. Just sleeping.

Wellâ€¦

I shouldn't wonder.

There's enough Seconal in those bottles
to bring down a bull elephant in heat.

Young Orson doesn't believe in chance.



[indistinct conversation]

You slipped me a Mickey.

So we did.

How you managed to reach it
so early in your rehabilitation,

I cannot imagine.

How was it? Mother's milk?

On balance, better than nothing.
I plan to use it as a nightcap.

As you Yanks say,
"He went out like a light."

I couldn't have put it better myself,
which may be why I write for the movies.

Will you stop?

You write for the movies
because you're super at it.

Excuse me, you two,
I've masses of typing to do.


By the time she translates
your red chicken scratches,

it'll be less than 40.

At this rate, you'll never finish.

What I wanna know is what you think of it.

but you know that.

His lust for power,

your exquisite evocation
of his hunger for love

from those who fear his worst side, but...

The dreaded yet foreseeable "but."

You're asking a lot
of a motion picture audience.

All in all, it's a bit of a jumble.
Did you say "jumble" or "jungle"?


A collection of fragments
that leap around in time,

like Mexican jumping beans.

Welcome to my mind, Old Sock.

The story is so scattered,
I'm afraid one will need a road map.

You mean it's a mess.

Would you consider simplifying?


"If only I'd had more time,
I would have written a shorter letter."

All I am saying is
no one can write like that.

But I <i>can </i>write like that, Houseman.
I have.

The narrative is one big circle,
like a cinnamon roll,

not a straight line
pointing to the nearest exit.

You cannot capture a man's entire life
in two hours.

All you can hope
is to leave the impression of one.


People aren't spending
their hard-earned 25 cents to see <i>Macbeth.</i>

Maestro the Dog-Faced Boy did <i>Macbeth.</i>

<i>Voodoo Macbeth.</i>
Don't be fooled. He's a showman.

Busker reveling in sleight of hand.

Save yourself the trouble,
be done in 60 days.

He'll get this,
and the audience will too.

Stop worrying. Have a pickle.

No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

Haven't been since we got here.

Cheerio.

Write hard. Aim low.

[laughs dryly]

[door closes]

Where were we, chief?


[sighs] About what?
[Rita] He's right.

You won't be done till Christmas.

What?
[Rita] You made a promise.

I did what?
Sixty days is two weeks from now.

[car engine starts]

Where were we?

Bernstein's speech,
the young woman on the ferry boat.

Read it back, please.

"A white dress she had on,
and she was carrying a white parasol,

and I only saw her for one second,
and she didn't see me at all."

"But I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since
that I haven't thought of that girl."

A snapshot
from the Mankiewicz family album?

You might say that.

It really is a gorgeous...

Spot to get stuck?

Is Bernstein meant to be Louis Mayer?

If form follows function.

Mayer is the same pathetic
sort of lap dog to our Charles Foster?

Bernstein is a far nicer character.

You don't much like Mayer.

If I ever go to the electric chair,
I'd like him to be sitting in my lap.


{\an8}$750 a week?
That's half what you make, Herman.

You're a junior writer, Joe.
So?

So, you're only half the wit
your big brother is.

How many half-wits make that?
Herm, how do I look?

You look like you. Fine.
[sighs] What should I be expecting?

You're related to me.
He already thinks you're a genius.

Enough.

if you can do two things.

One, don't roll your eyes.
Two, try not to fall asleep.


You want I should make a picture
about a prostitute?


My mother was nothing but a whore.

your own mother that way?

The woman who gave you life?

You ungrateful bastard!
I ought to cut your balls off!

Do it, you fucking junk dealer!
I'll still be the better man!

L.B., this is my brother, Joe.

Nice to meet you, Joseph. I'm Louis Mayer.

I can't tell you
what this means to him, Louis.

They're all there, Mr. Mayer.
On my way. Joe, walk with me.

My boy,
there are three work rules at this studio.

Rule number one.
<i>Ars gratia artis, </i>art for art's sake.

How you doing?

One million dollars a year
we spend on stories we never even film.

Why not? I'll tell you.
They don't make me cry.

What makes me cry? Emotion.

Where do I feel emotion?

Here, here, and here.

Rule number two.

You may have heard MGM has more stars
than there are in the heavens.

Do not believe this.

Hiya. We have only one star.
That is Leo the Lion.

Never forget that.

Many stars have,
and now they twinkle elsewhere.

Rule number three.

People think MGM
stands for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

It does not.

It stands for Mayer's <i>gantze mishpokhe,</i>
Mayer's whole family.

Never forget that.

You got a problem, come to Papa.

This is a business where the buyer
gets nothing for his money but a memory.

What he bought
still belongs to the man who sold it.

That's the real magic of the movies,
and don't let anybody tell you different.

[studio bell rings]

[crowd murmuring]


I find myself in a horrendous position,
and I come to all of you on bended knee.

We are suffering, as all Americans are,

from our country's terrible economic woes.

Good people, everyday people,
can't afford to go to the movies.

So even our preeminent dream factoryâ€¦

Is in grave financial difficulty.

[crowd murmuring]

I am asking everyone in the MGM family
to take a painful step.

I am asking to roll back salaries.
[crowd grumbling]


but for this hallowed place
to continue to exist, I am forced to.

I won't break up this family
over something like money.

How long are you asking for?
Shouldn't be long.

How much are you asking for?
[Mayer] Half.

[worker 1] Half?
Could be less.

Is everybody going to be pitching in?
Are you, Mr. Mayer?

Real families root for each other
in the good times,

take care of each other in tough ones.

We're with you, L.B.

You may be, Mr. Barrymore,

but a 50% pay cut
for grips and electricians...

Eight weeks, my friends,
eight short weeks.

As soon as FDR reopens the banks,
you'll get back every penny.

On that,
you have the sacred word of L.B. Mayer.

Well, I vote yes.

I do as well.
Me too.

[all chuckling]

[crowd murmuring]


How'd I do, Ben?
It was great, Mr. Mayer.

Ah.

[upbeat jazz music playing]

Not even the most disgraceful thing
I've ever seen.

[Fraulein Freda] Good.
[Mank moans]

[Fraulein Freda] Okay.
[Mank moans]

Yeah?
[Mank] Oh, yeah.

[Fraulein Freda] Yeah? Okay.

Maybe a little bit left?

Yeah?
Yeah.

Here?

Ooh, yeah.
I've got to get typewriter ribbon.

Here are this morning's pages.
[Mank] Dreck. It's all dreck!

Don't flagellate.
At least you're writing again.

[telephone rings]
None of it sings. None of it. Not a note.

You're not writing an opera.

Hello?

But I <i>am </i>writing an opera.

It's for you.

Yeah?
<i>- Herman, it's Joe.</i>

Hey, hey, kid. What's up?

Checking in. How are you getting around?
<i>- Gingerly.</i>

Any rest?
Haven't seen a sunrise yet.

You've never seen a sunrise.

<i>- Sara said you wanted this number.</i>
Just to hear your voice.

Oh. She said you had some work
you wanted to talk about.

Ah. I was thinking about that old play,
<i>The Wild Man of Borneo,</i>

<i>the one you wrote in the Ice Age.</i>

One never remembers one's disasters.
It's considered gauche.

A play is never a disaster

<i>till the movies say it is.</i>

[Mank laughs]
I brought it to my people at the studio.

We want W.C. Fields.

<i>- We want you to adapt.</i>
I'm kind of on something right now.

<i>I can get you paid for the play
and the adaptation.</i>

Sounds great.

<i>I'll have to think about it.</i>

You know how these things
have their moment.

So this isn't an offer.
It's a subtle ultimatum.

<i>Nobody could ever tell you what to do.</i>

Did Sara put you up to this?

<i>Not at all, but I know how things are.</i>

I can tell by her voice.

<i>- And how bad is that, baby brother?</i>
How bad?

<i>I went to a party last night</i>

<i>where Scott Fitzgerald
referred to you as a ruined man.</i>

[laughs]
That's how bad things can get.

<i>- That's good. I may use that.</i>
[chuckles]

<i>- Hermie...</i>
[sighs] Please, stop, Joey.

Just tell me what's on your mind.

I hear you're hunting dangerous game.

Word on the street is radio's golden boy
wants to go toe-to-toe with Willie Hearst,

<i>and you're helping in the kitchen.</i>

Oh?

And?
"And?"

Herman, "And?"

<i>How stupid of me.</i>

I thought
I was rejecting a humiliating handout,

when all the time,
I was nixing a respectable bribe.

And I'm sorry I ever cared.

[hangs up]

Oops.

[Fraulein Freda] Come on.
[grunts]


{\an8}[typewriter dings]

{\an8}[Hearst] Marion and I are pleased
you all could come stay for the weekend.

I hope the train ride wasn't too arduous.

And tonight, we're celebrating
our great friend's birthday

in our little hillside home. Charlie.

[playing piano]
[all]<i> â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Happy birthday, dear Louis â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª</i>

[man] Happy birthday!
[guests cheer]


Louis, you should be joyous.
You don't look a day over 48.

I feel 35.

[all laughing]

Mr. Hearst, Marion, all of you,

my heart is full to bursting.

I can't express in wordsâ€¦


W. R., nothing is more precious to me
than your friendship and sage advice.

I am blessed to call you my friend.

God bless William Randolph Hearst.

[all] Cheers.
[softly] God bless us, everyone.

Hear, hear.
A very happy birthday, Louis.

Our country should be flattered
you picked its birth date as your own.

The rest of us have to be satisfied
with the one we happen to be born on.

Mank.
[all chuckling]

Here's to your rich Canadian imagination.


Here's to banks reopening.

And to freedom.
[all] Freedom!

I believe you've met
our distinguished guest,

Mr. Rexford Tugwell.

Now, Rex is special assistant
to President Roosevelt,

and we're all interested
in what you might share with us.

We all wanna welcome the Thalbergs

back from Irving's long convalescence
in Europe.

Thank you, W.R.
[Hearst] Good to see you, Irving.

Thank you, Mr. Hearst.
Norma.

[plays flourish on piano]
Anybody seen anything good lately?

I just saw <i>42nd Street.</i> It blew my wig!

You can take the girl outta Bed-Stuy.

When was that?
Over the weekend.

You were in D.C.
I went to the pictures in Santa Barbara.

We have a fine screening room here.
[Mayer] Warner's picture?

Why waste money on that?
[all laugh]

Next time, I'll go with you.
[Marion] Of course.

I am bonkers about <i>Movietone News.</i>
I love Lowell Thomas's voice.

Oh, is he single?
[both laugh]

I sat across from him
at the Brown Derby once.

He bought me a drink.
He didn't!


But I made sure
to run into him in the parking lot after.

I asked him, "Do you need a lift?"
You didn't! What did he say?

I'll never tell.
There's a point to this, dear?

Well, yes, they showed that Hitler
giving a speech, kissing babies.

He is creepers!

Lederhosen and suspenders. Terrifying.

No, it's the mustache that's the horror.
[all laugh]

He won't be around for long.

The Germans
are a thoughtful, considerate people.

Enough about Nazis.

Irving, tell us about your travels.
Where were you?

[inhales sharply] Uhâ€¦ Berlin, in fact.
[all chuckle]

But it was quite interesting.

Thugs in brown shirts
goose-stepping past our hotel all night,

screaming anti-Semitic slogans.

I was terrified the whole time.
This Hitler sounds like an utter drip.

Shouldn't the United States
do something, Mr. Tugwell?

We are weighing all options.

Can't last. Who in the world
takes a lunatic like that seriously?

Well, the last time I looked,
40 million Germans.

Mank! You're always
so wonderfully contrary.

"Chase & Sanborn's <i>der</i> coffee."

[in German accent]
"Can 40 million Nazis all be wrong?"

I just read they've opened
their first concentration camps

and started burning books.

What's next? Movies?
Enough.

Is that true, Irving?
Yes, L.B.

Ah, Hitler, schmitler!

You don't turn your back on
a market as big as Germany.

Please. It's upsetting enough
Marion had to endure the man in newsreel.

What's a concentration camp?

It was fascinating.
Those people adore him.

I'm probably talking nonsense.
You're the first tonight that isn't.

how about Upton Sinclair's book?

No!

He wants to turn private enterprise
over to the state.

There's one we won't be optioning.
Eh, Irving?

Well, it's selling like crazy.

Walter Winchell says Sinclair may run
for governor next election.

That rat Bolshevik
belongs right up there with Hitler

on the list of people
not to be taken seriously.

There's a world of difference
between communism and socialism.

want something for nothing.

Like a workforce for free?

Half, and only in the interim.

I think it's safe to assume
none of us here would welcome

a crusading socialist
as California's political savior.

Certainly not FDR. Am I right, Rex?

Off the record,
President says the man bears watching.

Especially now that Republicans
seem bent on running Frank Merriam again.

Sinclair's run twice before
and got, what, 2% of the vote?

Good people, the man is an author.
As was Thomas Jefferson.

Ha! Come now, Mank.
Upton Sinclair as Thomas Jefferson?

No, you're right, W.R.

Jefferson never got federal laws
passed to ban oil monopolies,

or railroad trusts,
or cleaned up the stockyards.

He's an angry scribe, a provocateur.
Because he provokes thought.

You always side with the writer, Mank.

Poor souls surviving a depression
on five grand a week.

Commies.
L.B. is not wrong.


You know the difference
between communism and socialism.

In socialism, everyone shares the wealth.

In communism, everyone shares the poverty.

Thank you, Mr. Mankiewicz.

Upton just wants you to apportion
some of your Christmas bonus, Irving,

to the people who clean your house.

[guests laughing]

Now that's why I always want Mank around.
[chuckles] Me too.

Upton, Mank? Nobody's asking
to hear you sing "The Internationale."

[plays "The Internationale"]

What's that?
The Communist national anthem, darling.

I would. Do you sing?

No one should have to hear me sing.
Isn't that right, Sara?

If at all possible.

chairman-elect,

I'm telling you,
nothing's going to happen here.

The people who count
in California won't let it.

All this talk
is so much pissing in the wind.

Nicely put.

I heard Pops on the phone
helping to pick the president's cabinet

like casting a movie.

They can stop a guy like Sinclair.

Couldn't you, Pops?

Pardon.

[unsettling music playing]

I don't know what I'm saying.

Go.

[sighs deeply]


Hello, Tokyo?

London, you there?

Ah, nerts!
[Mank] What is that?


Never ever be out of touch
with your empire.

No, no. What's "nerts"?
Nerts is Brooklynese for "nuts."

Jeepers!

What did I do that was so terrible?

I shouldn't have said that thing
about the cabinet in front of Tugwell,

but since when does anybody care
what I have to say?

Those things just pop out of my mouth,

and the moment they do, I feel likeâ€¦

Like you got caught, <i>jambes en I'air.</i>


Well, do you always
just say whatever you think? Hmm.

[chuckles]
[Mank] You're blushing.

Am not.
Are too.

Am not.
Are too. I can see it even in the dark.

Well, what can I tell you, Mank?
Marion Dourasâ€¦

Went to convent school.

Hedda! Louella!
[laughs]

Where's a gossip columnist
around this castle when you need one?

I hate shop talk.
I never know what's going on.

The one thing you never ever talk about
is Upton Sinclair.

I noted.

The moment he's mentioned,
the evening turns.

It's sort of a sore subject.
Really?

Do tell.

who this Mr. Sinclair is,

but he wrote about us for a book.

I used to quote it word for word.

"I saw our richest newspaper publisher
keep his movie mistress

in a private city
of palaces and cathedrals,

furnished with shiploads
of junk imported from Europe

and surrounded by vast acres
reserved for use by zebras and giraffes,

telling in jest
that he had spent six million dollars

to make his lady's reputation

and using his newspapers
to celebrate her change of hats."

It must be hard
to be on the receiving end of that.

People think because you're
on the cover of <i>Modern Screen,</i>

they know you.

[Mank] Hmm.
Ah, nerts!

What do I have to complain about?

I live in a fishbowl,
but anything I want is mine.

If I could, I'd share with everyone.
You know that, Mank.

This Upton doesn't know
a thing about the realâ€¦

[gasps]
[monkeys chattering]

a monkey out of William Randolph Hearst!


I understand why Mayer loathes him.
Why?

Sinclair caught him with his pants down.
[inhales sharply] Yikes!

He wrote that Mayer took a bribe
to look the other way

so a rival could buy MGM.


It's complicated.
Over my head?

No, over mine.
You'd need a degree in larceny.

Isn't bribery a crime?
That's what Sinclair said.

The little sausage
might have gone to jail.

Jeepers!


<i>"Mayn gantze mishpokhe. </i>My <i>mishpokhe."</i>

[Marion] I don't speak a lot of Jewish.
[laughs] Really?

"My <i>mishpokhe. </i>My family."

Everything he does is for family,

except when it comes
to selling his last name

to a competitor
in the middle of the night.

Wow. He would do that to his own studio?

He doesn't own MGM
any more than Sam Goldwyn.

They just run it
for the moneyboys back East.

And jail is not something
an animal like Mayer is likely to forget.

[elephant trumpets]

[both laugh]

Irving must be clean.
He looks like he shaves three times a day.

Well, there's clean, and there's clean.

Irving bought one of Sinclair's novels.

Sinclair demanded a guarantee
that not one word could be changed,

in writing,
on the back of the purchase check.

from Irving Thalberg?

When Thalberg refused,
Sinclair took his money

and ran off to Mexico and financed
a picture about the Russian Revolution.

[both chuckle]

Now, that's sticking the old neck out.


[Marion laughing]

[gasps]
Oh.

I'm sorry. Instinct!

My fault.

I've been a little
sixes and sevens recently.

Tell me something, Mank. The truth.

Could you see me playing

Elizabeth Barrett Browning
or Marie Antoinette?

Irving's bought 'em both,
you know, because of Pops.

What do you think?

And honestly.

I see you more as Dulcinea.

Who?
Dulcinea.

From the Spanish, for sweetness.


"Her hair, gold. Her cheeks, roses."

Nice.

"Her lips, coral."
Mmm.

"Her neck, alabaster. Her bosom, marble."

Marble? [scoffs]

Maybe once.

"Ivory, her hands,
and her whiteness, snow."

You wrote that?
No. A fella named Cervantes.

[clears throat]

"There are meters
of accent and meters of tone,

but the best of all meters
is to meet her alone."

Ah, a poem with a message.
That's just the first verse.

The lastâ€¦

"There are letters of accent
and letters of tone,

but the best of all letters
is to let her alone."

[Marion laughs]

Now, those I wrote.

[Mank chuckles]

[Marion sighs happily]

[coyotes howling in the distance]

[bottles clinking]

[gasps softly]

[Mank sighs]

Do come in.

Jesus! What is that?
Sunlight. It's nearly noon.

Mother of God! Where did the night go?

Your support device is here.
Oh, good. Send it in.

As is Mr. Houseman.

What would you like me to do?

Well, send him in too.


Uh, put it over there, please.

You're early.
I thought we should talk.

[Mank] Why are you wearing a coat?
I always wear a coat.

Must be 108 degrees.

We're at a Rubicon moment, Mank.
[Mank] Uh-huh.

It's not the work.
That's everything we hoped it would be.

[Mank] Enough room there?
Oh, it should be.


You've only written ninety pages.
Ninety-one.

you're hardly out of the first act.

I mean,
how do you hope to be done in 14â€¦ 13 days?

We gave him
our solemn word we would deliver.

"We"?
I don't think he's going to take it well.

Not very well at all.

You said 90 days. Welles said 60.
I'm doing the very best I can.

We are surely to be axed.
Not just yet.

I've never been fired.

I've never not been fired.
I don't get fired.

It's not as unpleasant
as you might imagine.

You worry too much, John.

What do you do for pleasure?
[telephone rings]

Hello? Yes, he's here.
[man speaks indistinctly on phone]


[inhales sharply] Will you talk?

with Mr. Houseman.


Orson.
[Orson speaking indistinctly]

I came early
to see where we were with, uhâ€¦

No, not at all.
Everything's going absolutely accordingâ€¦

Well, that's difficult to say exactly.

Yep. Yes, I know the clockâ€¦

Well, as I've told you, it's quite unique.

In fact,
I would venture to say, one of the mostâ€¦

Yes, well,
it will absolutely need your marvelousâ€¦

He's on the mend, working tirelessly.

[crate creaks]
[Houseman] Of course. When?

I'm on my way.

Yes. Hang on. He's right here.

He wants to see me right away.
Wouldn't tell me why.

Perhaps he will you.

[Mank grunts]

Orson.
[Welles laughs] <i>Tell me what's up, Mank.</i>

He's getting on my nerves.

<i>I sensed that.
I told him I had to see him at once.</i>

Hopefully, I can think of a reason
before he gets here.

<i>I've finished my test</i>
<i>for</i> Heart of Darkness.

<i>I'm turning my full attention
to our little project.</i>


[Welles] <i>Tell me what to expect.</i>
I thought you'd want to be surprised.

Ha. You're always surprising.
That's why you were my only choice.

<i>No one else is Mankiewicz.
I can almost hear the finish line.</i>

We're about to turn a corner.
<i>- Unto the breach!</i>

Slim, you may tote

those lovely highland beauties
to the kitchen.

Fraulein Freda, empty the Mickeys

and start replacing
their contents, <i>raus schnell.</i>

Thank you, Slim. You may go.
[Mank] Slim.

Mr. Mankiewicz, please don't ask us
to help you in this sad deception.

My dear Mrs. Alexander,

Charlie Lederer and I went to a great deal
of trouble to engineer this sad deception.

My deadline
is two weeks away and I intend...

It could mean our jobs.

I do my best thinking
before I fall asleep.

And I am sick and tired
of having my evenings end

with the abrupt sensation of being
struck on the head with a croquet mallet.

A way to put it.
I'm not asking you to help.

You're not?
I'm telling you.


I'm sorry. I won't be bullied.
You'll have my resignation in the morning.

I know Freda's been sneaking
you nightcaps from the cabinet.

If she continues
to cooperate in this cheap ruse,

I'll have to report the both of you.

Fraulein Freda.
<i>- Ja, </i>Herr Mank?

Please do as I instructed.
<i>- Ja, </i>Herr Mank.


Humph.

Freda, you mustn't let him intimidate you.


I am not intimidated, Frau Alexander.
Then, why?

[Fraulein Freda sighs]

Herr Mank sponsored
my family's entry into this country.

He's responsible for us getting safely
out of Germany, legally and financially.

Really?
Our entire village, he brought here.

Entire village?
Over 100 people.

Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister,

will not allow his films
to be shown in the Fatherland.

I didn't realize.

He wrote a picture about the Nazis,
which no studio anywhere will dare make.

I assume if he wishes to drink,
he's a grown man, a good man,

and should be treated as such.

<i>Nicht wahr?</i>

To Mank-town. Or is it Mank-ville?


What's German for blabbermouth?

Either you demonstrate
you can handle this,

or we will all end up getting sacked.

There's nothing like
a vote of confidence from one's peers.

To Mank-berg. <i>Prosit.</i>

Mank-heim. Bottoms up.

{\an8}[typewriter dings]

Hey, Mank, you remember me?

Of course I remember you, C.C.

C.C. for Central Casting.
How you been, Mank?

What happened?

[C.C.] What happened?
The goddamn Depression happened.

I ain't had so much
as a walk-on since <i>Tugboat Annie.</i>

Listen. I hate to, you knowâ€¦

Uh, yeah. Ed, lend me a buck.

Uh, me and Grady here
been thinking of bummin' east to Miami.

I heard it from someone who knows,

the Hollywood studios are movin'
to Florida.

Who told you that?
Oh, I can't say.

Somebody in the know.

In certain echelons,
it's common knowledge.

Well, people in certain echelons

don't usually trust me
with sensitive information.

But the studios aren't moving anywhere.
That's just company-town propaganda.

Believe what you want,
but say, you think you could spareâ€¦

Uhâ€¦ Ed?


[C.C.] Bless you, Mank.


Yes, he reinstated salaries,

but he never gave back the money
he promised.

Giant surprise.

Come on, Mank. We need guys like you
to keep people like Mayer honest.

I'd refer you, for that,
to the power of prayer.

The Writers Guild
doesn't have to hit the bricks

for the $2,500-a-week guy.

We're doing it for the $250-a-week guy.

Joe, all the $250-a-week writers I know
are getting $2,500.

Stop crying for your just deserts,
or they're liable to give them to you.

Then we'll all be working
for 75 bucks a week.

I don't know if you've ever walked
a picket line. You might have to.

And Dave Chasen will cater.

"Junior writers only paid $750 a week."

If that happens, you'd better run

before real folk
with real troubles stone you to death.

Hermie, the guild's in its infancy.

It needs you.
[Mank] You're telling me.

What writer failed to notice

the Screen Writers Guild
needs an apostrophe?

As Groucho always said,

"Never belong to any club

that would have someone like you
for a member."

[Joe groans, sighs]

And look at him.

The most miserable bastard
on God's green earth.

I'd tell him you said that,
only he'd think you were brownnosing.

[grill hissing]

Close the door.

[Mank sniffs]

Ahâ€¦ summer.

Inez, you are not to let the Brothers Marx
wait in my office. Ever.

They've been grilling hot dogs again.

Sit down.

[Mank exhales]

You wanted to see me?

Not that I care,
but why aren't you contributing

to MGM's anti-Sinclair fund?

Well, call me old-fashioned, Irving,
but I don't like being told

which side of a fight I'm already on.

How's it gonna look
if the GOP chairman himself

can't get unanimous support
from his own studio?

[Mank chuckles]

You're serious.

I was taught
by my parents to be straightforward,

to ask simply for what I want, and expect
that I may have to elucidate my position.

Well, I was encouraged by mine
to use my imagination,

but I taught myself
to avoid the consequences.

It's ten bucks, Mank.

You piss that away between hopeless bets.

I hate to think what L.B. might do
if he knew you were the only holdout.

I am, and he doesn't?
And we're not gonna tell him.

I could let you go for this.
It is a hanging offense.

I'll add the appropriate amount
to your gambling debt

and forget we ever had this conversation.

You do that.

And the brand-spanking-new Writers Guild

might find it very interesting,
not to mention the newspapers.

I'm not sure the guild
intends to cover games of chance.

And you won't go to the press,
because in California, that means Hearst.

Irving, you are the shrewdest executive
in this town.

Why are you acting
like some dumb ward heeler?

You don't need my donation.
You don't need anybody's.

You have everything it takes right here.

Meaning?

swear King Kong is ten stories tall

and Mary Pickford a virgin at 40.

Yet you can't convince
starving voters that a turncoat socialist

is a menace
to everything Californians hold dear?

You're barely trying.

You signed your rights to the Mercury.
You agreed not to take screen credit.

I needed the work.
You may want to reconsider.

All I currently want is a real shower,
a cocktail, and my Sara to wake up to.

Are you certain?

It worked out.

Mank, if I may be so bold, why Hearst?

Lord knows,

you were always
his favorite dinner partner.

Poor sap.
Not only has he got no money,

he's an idealist, for Christ's sakes.

Talk about political handicaps. I'm out.

he'll lose by 200,000.

It's amazing
what $10 million against him bought.

Raise.

That's what he gets
for surrounding himself with amateurs.

They not only charge admission to rallies,

they pass a plate

I'll see you guys
and bump you two big ones.

It's important.

What, now, Shelly?


That's the first good hand
I've had all day.

I didn't know he knew
what a good hand looked like.


[reporter on film] <i>Mind telling</i>
<i>who you favor in this election?</i>

[man 1] <i>I'm going to vote</i>
<i>for Frank Merriam.</i>


<i>Well, I want Merriam because I want a job.</i>

<i>If you drive all the capital
out of the country, who's gonna pay us?</i>

<i>would be safest for all of us?</i>

[man 1] <i>Absolutely.</i>

<i>It's no time
to trade horses in the middle of a stream.</i>

<i>are you voting in the election?</i>

[Butler] <i>I am.</i>
[reporter] <i>Who would you vote for?</i>

<i>I'm sure
that I'm gonna vote for Mr. Sinclair.</i>


<i>Mr. Sinclair's got something new.
He got that EPIC Plan.</i>

<i>I feel as though it's time
we should try something new out again.</i>

<i>I need prosperity.</i>

[man 2] <i>Well, first of all,</i>
<i>I'm an American,</i>

<i>and I believe that Mr. Merriam</i>

<i>will support all the foundations
and principles</i>

<i>that this country has stood for
in the past 150 years.</i>

<i>I have a job now, and I wanna keep it.</i>

<i>My wife and I love California,
and we'd like to stay.</i>

<i>But in case we should have to leave,</i>

<i>I'd like to have
at least a couple dollars.</i>


[indistinct chatter]

<i>why you're voting for Frank Merriam.</i>

<i>Well, I'm voting for Frank Merriam
because I wanna keep our way of life.</i>

<i>wouldn't protect your way of life?</i>


<i>I don't know much about politics,
but I do know this.</i>

<i>If Upton Sinclair wins this election,</i>

<i>private ownership in California
won't amount to a hill o' beans.</i>

[in faux Russian accent]<i> Well, we need</i>
<i>complete rejuvenation of our system,</i>

<i>so I vote for Comrade Upton.</i>

<i>His system work in Russia, why not here?</i>


[sighs]
What'd you think?

Truthfully, Shelly,
if the performances were any better,

you'd be ashamed of yourself.

Only half of 'em were actors.
[sighs]

It's got that raw newsreel feel,
hasn't it?

But it isn't news and it isn't real.
I wasn't looking for an ethical debate.

When did they cook this up?
At a meeting in production.

They were passing around a pamphlet
Sinclair wrote called "Ending Poverty inâ€¦"

"America's unemployed
will invade the Golden State."

Mayer was giddy to use it against him.
Yeah, I bet he was.

that a writer is more of a menace

to an unsuspecting public
than a party hack.

Manky... [spills drink, inhales sharply]
You okay?

Just nerves.

If it's bothering you, Shelly,
why get involved?

They gave me a chance to direct.

You don't think anyone old enough
to vote is gonna buy this shit?

Only the ones who believe
King Kong is ten stories tall

or Mary Pickford a virgin at 40.

[door opens]

Thanks, Cedric. These are fine.

I've just watched our Sinclair films.

Ah. What did you think?

With all due respect to Shelly,
<i>King Kong</i> they ain't.

Though I do think footage

of invading hobos
has a certain xenophobic power

when front-paged in the <i>Times</i>
and backed by those tacky billboards.

Shelly got a chance to direct,
and I canceled your $12,000 gambling debt.

I'd call that a fair return
on a one-minute lecture

for uninspired studio chieftains.

Your director's been stricken
with a bout of conscience.

I'm sure he'll tell me himself.

Don't do this, Irving.

When I was just a boy passing out
socialist leaflets in the Bronx,

a couple Tammany goons came
to show me the error of my ways.

And one of them crushed my testicles

until I volunteered to distribute
my wares into the East River.

That's politics. I didn't invent it,
I don't apologize for it.

Mayer's not paying for this.

He never pays for anything.

Willie?

Marion might be interested.
Well, you're gonna have to hurry.

Mayer's over there now
giving her the company kiss-off.

Oh, haven't you heard?

She's taking her playpen
to Warner Bros. Permanently.

Warner's?

I wouldn't let her do <i>Marie Antoinette.</i>

Goldwyn's right for once.

[mimics Goldwyn]
"A comedienne in that role is to laugh."

Besides, her pictures
haven't made a dime in a decade.

Congratulations, Irving.

I know what I am, Mank.

When I come to work,
I don't consider it slumming.

I don't use humor
to keep myself above the fray.

And I go to the mat for what I believe in.
I haven't the time to do otherwise.

But you, sir,

how formidable people like you might be
if they actually gave at the office.

Close the door.

[indistinct chatter]
[camera flashbulbs crackling]

[Mank panting]

that's a beautiful shot right there.


Mank! Are you okay?

No, that almost killed me.
Where's Willie?

Cairo, I think.

Can you phone him?
I don't phone him, he phones me.

When's he due back?

After November 6th.
I'm joining him in Europe next week.

Marion, I need a favor.
It's just a little joke on Willie.

Sure, Mank, anything.

I want you to go back and tell Mayer

Willie wants
the phony Sinclair films pulled.

Which phony Sinclair films?

There isn't time to explain.
I just need you to tell him that.

Oh, I couldn't, not even as a joke.

[Mank] Why not?
You know I don't lie.

And that's why he'd believe you.

Marion, please,
you're not in convent school anymore.

I'm sorry. Iâ€¦ I know it's silly, but...
But what? Why not?

Promise you won't laugh.
I promise I won't laugh.

My exit.
What?

I already made my exit.


[laughing uproariously]

[Rita] Manky!
Whatie?

It's an ash-throated flycatcher!
Congratulations! Best kind.

What can I say?

She's my aunt.

Oh, it's not about her, it's about him.
Oh?

Or rather, it's him, but it's not her.
It isn't?

The lonely showgirl, trapped in a castle,
doing jigsaw puzzles.

It's more, her as people
who don't know her imagine her to be.

I see.

It's her as they imagine her,
but it's him as you knew him.

Damn it, Charlie.
You asked me out here.

I was honored
to come and read your latest.

Is this a test?
A test? Of what?

Friendship? Loyalty?
Oh, come now.

Or just your way
of avoiding responsibility?

What do you mean?

Are you hoping I might absolve you
of such a personal betrayal?

I won't give you that.

Are you going to say anything?


I have to think about it.
Why?

'Cause I haven't made up my mind
how she might react.

What does instinct tell you?


for a lifetime
of starry-eyed self-absorption.

It's one of those cures
that could be worse than the disease.

But you, of all people,
should know about that.

[car driving away]

He took the script?

Uh-huh.

Will he show it to her?



I don't know.

[fast jazz drumbeat playing]

[electricity crackling]

[indistinct chatter]

[typewriter dings]

[upbeat jazz music playing]
Sinclair is yesterday's fishwrap.

Never stood a chance.

Make up your mind.

Are we home licking our wounds
or here making the best of it?

We're making the best of it.

Good evening. Name?
Mankiewicz.

Sorry, what was that?

M-A-N-K-I-E-W-I-C, and outta nowhere, a Z.

Table 14.
Ends of the earth. Clean exit.

Mankiewicz, Herman.

Oh, terribly sorry.
Table one. Right this way.

If you can't say something nice,
don't say anything at all.

[camera flashbulbs crackling]

Table one.
[woman] Sara!

Good grief. Look who's here.
How about that?

Sara.
[Mayer] What a loyal friend you are.

I never thought we would see Mank.
I'm surprised.

I would've imagined you in pajamas by now.

Mank, turns out we have
the same dentist on Camden.

Sara, we have to plan
a day of shopping and catch up.

Herman, I met your brother.
He's a chip off the old block.

Quite handsome.

Please, sit.

I can't tell you how much it means.
I'm touched you'd come.

[voice breaking] Thank you.
[woman] Oh.

Why do I love you?

What's everyone else having?

[all laughing]
[sound fades out]

[upbeat jazz music continues playing]

[speaking indistinctly]

[radio announcer echoing]

{\an8}- [Mayer] What a great night. Great result.
I'll drink to that.

You see, if you just give people
what they need to know

in an emotional way,
you can expect they'll do the right thing.

I think what you mean,

"If you keep telling people
something untrue,

loud and long enough,
they're apt to believe it."

That's not what he was saying.

What's going on here?
Are we quoting Goebbels?

I'd like to debate that with L.B.
I'd like to see that.

Mank. Have another.


Maybe the informed
of California were late leaving work.

The last I heard, Irving,
it's still a democracy.

Of the people.
By the people.

What are you two talking about?


Double or nothin'?

[Mayer] What's he saying?
Herman.

You really will bet on anything.

Keep your money. I'm happy enough

just to nail
that utopian son of a bitch to the wall.

I told you. Your obligation
was canceled out of gratitude.

Wait a minute. What?

He wants to wager double or nothin'
on a debt he doesn't even owe us?

Mank.

It's a matter of principle, L.B.
You wouldn't understand.

I understand plenty. I'll take that bet.

Okay, Mank, you're on.
Twenty-four grand or nothing.

Excuse me.

I'm going to throw up.

[distorted radio announcer
delivering election results]

[man laughing]

[unsettling music playing]
[distorted election report continues]

[romantic music playing]

I needed some air.

Why do you love me?

Excuse me, friends.

[clears throat]

The final, incomplete, count
for tonight isâ€¦

Upton Sinclair, the lousy Bolshevikâ€¦
[man booing]

â€¦728,653.

Frank Merriamâ€¦

[guests cheering]

â€¦the good Republican,

948,814.
[all cheering loudly]

My friends! My friends!

Everybody get up and sing with me!

Sing with me! Everybody, up and sing!

<i>â™ª O beautiful for spacious skies â™ª</i>

It was a team effort. Thanks.

<i>â™ª For amber waves of grain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For purple mountain majestiesâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Uh, Mr. Mankiewicz,
I'm so sorry to bother you,

but there's a telephone call for you.
Right back this way.

<i>â™ª Americaâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Hello.
<i>- Mank, it's Shelly.</i>

It's Shelly.

[slurring] He lost, Mank.
[Mank] <i>Yeah, it's been a bad night.</i>

It's my fault.

Oh, easy, fella, you only voted once.
<i>- He was just on the radio.</i>

He said the phony newsreels
cost him the election.

That shows how naive he is.

FDR cost him the election
by staying on the sidelines.

<i>- Sleep it off.</i>
I'm not at home.

Where are you? Let me call you a cab.

<i>Never mind.
I'll take the Pasadena Freeway.</i>

Nobody'd be on it election night.

<i>Hello?</i>

Hello?

[operator]<i> How may I direct your call?</i>
Normandie, 4761.

He's shit-faced.

[phone rings]
Shell, is that you?

It's Herman Mankiewicz. Where is he?
[sighs]


He left here very upset,
and he's got a pistol with him.

Don't worry, Fay. I'll find him.

<i>- Eve.</i>
What?

I'm Eve. Fay was his first.
<i>- I'll find him.</i>

[sighs]
[hangs up]

Is Houseman coming back?
I never thought I'd miss him.

He and the wunderkind
are cutting the first draft.

A form of creative vivisection.

Vital organs are exposed,
nothing is learned,

the patient dies on the table.

[car approaching]
[dog barking]

What have we here?

Why, it's a puffed-up,
sharp-tailed, red-ruffled magpie.

A whatie?

How do you like the Mojave?
God's answer for drunks and reprobates.

Perfect place to dry out.

How's that working?
It didn't take. Cheers.

<i>L'chaim.</i>

Why are you doing this, Herm?

Posterity.
Posterity, my ass.

From the original Latin.
Don't patronize me.

My Latin grades were better than yours.

<i>Bibamus, moriendum est.</i>

I read your little script.

News travels fast.

Even without the title page,

you don't need
to be Philip Marlowe to know who wrote it.


It's veryâ€¦

Complicated.

Well, thanks for coming out.

Herman, this is me.

You pick a fight with Willie,
you are finished.

Mayer can't save you. Nobody can.

Especially the boy genius from New York.

You're far too political, Joe.
Self-preservation is not politics.

Him, I get.

But what did Marion ever do
to deserve this?

It's not her!

You know better than anyone,
not all characters are headliners.

Some are secondary.

Well, that's why I'm here.
On behalf of the secondary characters.

I thought you'd wanna know
there's a rumor in town

you're out to get Hearst

because they dropped you
from L.B.'s payroll,

that they didn't want you around anymore.

Don't believe everything
you hear at Schwab's.

Hey, you made yourself court jester.

Someone had to say it.

People are speculating Rosebud
is W.R.'s pet name for Marion's genitalia.

Now, I know you'd never stoop to that.

Only because I hadn't heard.

[both laughing]


you're up for Thalberg's old job.

[Joe] Not anymore.
Did I bollix that?

Don't flatter yourself, Herman.
I did it all alone.

Now, there's a first.

I exposed myself,
not entirely metaphorically, in court.

Do tell.

Somebody was bitching about Mervyn Leroy
running over budget on<i> Wizard of Oz.</i>

Goddamn movie again.
I said, "Le Roy <i>s'amuse."</i>

I was then forced to spend
the next 20 minutes

having to explain that "Le Roy"

is <i>"le roi"</i> in French
and means "the king."

Or to be specific, FranÃ§ois I,

and his royal habit of <i>s'amus-</i>ing himself

by diddling all the ladies of his court.

[both laughing]
[Mank coughing]

You know, Pop was right.
You should've been a professor.

Nobody knew
what the fuck I was talking about.

They say I was passed over
because I'm not a team player.

But I know better.

It was the goddamn French pun
that did me in.


I'm washed up, Joe.


It's the best thing you've ever written.

[car driving away]

A rare bird, that.

A Mankiewicz.

{\an8}[typewriter dings]

{\an8}[crickets chirping]

You can't do it that way.
Do what?

Kill yourself. I've tried. It takes years.

I was tired of doing inserts
and pick-up shots.

You're not the first person
to trade integrity

for a chance in the big chair.

Thalberg said this was your idea.

Sometimes my asides
are too clever by half.

Go home to Fay.

Eve.
Eve. Sorry.

Look at what we did.
We can't un-ring this bell.

We have to be vigilant.

In regards to?

People sitting in the dark,

willingly checking
their disbelief at the door.

We have a huge responsibility.

I got it.

Got what?

Parkinson's.


[Mank sighs]

I'm so sorry.

First, you get the tremors,

and your muscles begin to fail.

Pretty soon, you can't get out of a chair.

Then smiling, speaking,

everything goes.

And it keeps going tillâ€¦

You could always produce.


[Mank sighs]

Give me the gun, Shelly.

[Shelly grunts]

[bullets rattle]

Take 'em, Mank.

Go on home. I'll be fine.

[unsettling music playing]


[footsteps running]

Is he with you?

Heâ€¦ He wouldn't come.


[bullets jingling]

[bullet falls to floor]
[Eve] Oh, my God!

What?
He had a whole box. [breathing shakily]

[gunshot]
[loud thud]

Mank.
[gasps]

You have another visitor.

What?


In this heat, it'll flash to sugar.

Why the wine and dine, Marion?

Good cop, bad cop?

How do you mean, Mank?
First Joe, now you.

Can't you just tell me
what's on your mind?


Well, I read the script.

Who hasn't?

It's very grand, Mank, in its own way,
and very much you.

I would've loved to play me ten years ago.

It was never meant to be you.

For myself, I don't care, Mank.
Really, I don't.

But I beg you,
don't kick Pops when he's down.

Willie, down?
[peppy music playing on car radio]

I haven't told a soul this,

but I had to loan him a million dollars
just to save San Simeon.

You hocked your jewels?

Just some real estate.

He bought me most of it anyway.

Willie sent you.

Didn't have to.

That surprises you?

You're the most observant man I know.

Then you deserve better.
That's very sweet.

I always wanted better.

Mama Rose too.

She made sure
her daughters learned to sing and dance.

We were never gonna end up in Brooklyn.

I was only 16
when I was cast in <i>Stop! Look! Listen!</i>


Same seat every night.

And all the other girls said to watch out.
He was too old for me and too interested.

Come, now, he wasn't your only admirer.

The thing you got so right in your scriptâ€¦

Was how lonely he'd been as a boy.

When my own mother heard
he was one of the richest men in America,

she said, "Kick a little higher."

He has always been so kind to me.

I love the old guy, Mank.

Maybe I didn't always,
back when he was my social security.

But now,
there are things about us togetherâ€¦

That no one could possiblyâ€¦

Am I persuading you at all?

I hope, if this gets made,

you'll forgive me.

And I hope, if it doesn't,

you'll forgive me.

{\an8}[typewriter dings]

{\an8}[rabbi] He was a modest man.

His name never appeared on the marquee

with the great stars, producers,
and directors who worked alongside him.

[people crying]

But he loved moving pictures
more than he loved anything.

And he left his impeccable taste,
his incredible attention to detail,

on every frame he touched.

It is not for us to say
why he was taken from us so unexpectedly.

Behind, he leaves his memory.

The memory of a great man, a talented man,
a man of unblemished integrity.

Irving G. Thalberg.

[indistinct chatter]

Mank.

I haven't seen you since,
what was it, Jack Gilbert's funeral.

Well, I haven't seen you
since Shelly Metcalf's.

Has it been that long?

How you been, Mank?

Between pictures.

I thought you were still at MGM.

I am.

Well, look, come see me at International.
Let's work something out.

I did come see you.

You gave me the same invitation
after Shelly's funeral.

I couldn't get past
your secretary's secretary.

Is that right?

Good to see you, Mank.

[Mayer crying]

[Mank snoring]

[flies buzzing]

[telephone ringing]

[Rita] Hello.
[Welles] <i>Mank?</i>

One moment, please.

Mank.

Mank!

It's Orson.

It's Orson.
[Mank] Hmm.

Hello.

<i>your first draft and I must say</i>

<i>I'm pleased and impressed.</i>

Are ya? Good news.
<i>- It'll need work, of course.</i>

<i>But there are no problems
that can't be solved together.</i>

Well, I'm delighted to hear it.

<i>Houseman's bringing my notes.
Think about 'em.</i>

Meantime, I'll run everything
through my typewriter.

<i>Everything will thank you.</i>

I understand you're in touch
with your Hollywood crowd?

Oh, good old Houseman.

<i>So perhaps you've heard.
None of the theater chains will touch us.</i>

<i>It looks like RKO will have to sue
for restraint of trade.</i>

<i>They'll countersue, of course.</i>

<i>If you own that lovely home of yours,</i>

<i>it might be a good idea
to put it in Poor Sara's name.</i>

<i>- You still there, Mank?</i>
Oh, yes. Where else would I be?

<i>I've saved the best for last.</i>

Guess who phoned with an offer
to buy out RKO's investment

and shelve the picture permanently?

Not Hearst?
<i>- Mank, I'm surprised.</i>

<i>Would Othello snoop
on Desdemona when he has Iago?</i>

Ah, Mayer. What did RKO say?

<i>No dice, for now, but they're
on their uppers. Whether they...</i>

You'd better drive up.
<i>- I plan to, just as soon as I'm done...</i>

Today, if possible.

<i>Dear Jove, did I say something
I shouldn't have?</i>

I hope you haven't lost your nerve.

Nerve's about all I've got left.

{\an8}[Hearst] What a year you've had, Louis.
How have you weathered it?

Despite everything, the MGM ship,
I'm happy to say, is full steam ahead.

We're on track with this recent slate
for our most successful year ever.

Well, that's great news.

[loud clattering]
[man 1] Would you like to go lay down?

[Mank slurring] I think
I'd rather stay upright.

[man 1] Perhaps we can find you a costume.


[Mank clears throat]

Hello, everyone. Better late than never.


Uh, caring for clan Mankiewicz.

[man 2] And what train did you take?
[Mank] Glendale. I missed my stop.

Got a taxi from Morro Bay.

I'm confused. I thought the invitation
called for circus attire, not flea circus.

I was cornered by a man
who sold vacuum cleaners.

A show of hands,
who knows what a vacuum cleaner is?

for Mr. Mankiewicz,

somewhere where he might get some air?



Mr. Monkeywitz could use some coffee.

[guests chuckling]

[chair being pulled out]

coming together?

a struggle for general audiences.

We made some trims, but I should've known.

Versailles, all those costumes and wigs.

You can't tell those stories

without overhauling them
for a modern audience.

How's the performance
of your leading lady?


Norma put her heart and soul into it.

I should've insisted she take some time.

It's a lot to deal with, a loss like that.

Marion would've made it her own.

Marion would've been perfection.
[women] Aw.

Marion Antoinette.

[Mayer] But it was Irving's picture.
Marionette.

I'm not interested
in educating our customers.

You want to send a message?
Call Western Union.

[guests laughing]


"Let them get cake."

Who needs to see that?

[glass shatters]
[all gasp]

Joanna, come along.

I'll show you those horses
we talked about. [grunts]

[both chuckle]

[Joanna giggles]

She's very pretty.

Also, very bright,
bullheaded, and British.

Are you here
to try your luck, too, Schnutz?

[Sara] At what?
Changing my mind.

I never had much success
with that, Herman.

In the end, you'll do what you need to.

Charlie's been here,
Joe's been, Marion's been.

For one reason or another,
all of them want me to walk away.

You care to hear what I've decided?

Not really.


blind loyalty
can get a little suffocating.

Okay. Here goes.

I've rehearsed it enough.

I've raised your kids kosher
and all but by myself.

I've put up with your suicidal drinking,

your compulsive gambling,
your silly platonic affairs.

You owe me, Herman.

So Joe says he can't promise,

but he thinks if you make nice with Mayer,
you can have your old job back.

Is that what you want me to say?

I know what your answer'll be,

so don't ask me to give you
Poor Sara's seal of approval.

Why do you put up with me, Schnutz?

My movie star looks
or my diplomat's charm?

I suppose because being
married to you, Herman,

I'm never bored.

Exhausted, yes. Exasperated, usually.

But having devoted so much,

I have to stick around
to see how it all turns out.

And whatever you decide,

please be mindful of those
who care about you most.

I'm going riding.

Haven't seen a horse's face in years.

[Mank chuckles softly]

Oh, and one last thing, Herman.

I don't want nobody
calling me Poor Sara no more.

[Mank sighs]

I've got a great idea
for a picture, Louis.

A picture I just know you're gonna love.

of Quixote.

Now, I know none of you read,
but you know what it's about.

A deluded old nobleman
who tilts at windmills.

So how might we update this story?

Do you want me to get...
No, no.

How about we make our Quixoteâ€¦

A newspaperman?

Who else could
make a living tilting at windmills?

But that's not enough.

No, he wants more than readership.

He wants more than adulation.
He wants love.

So, he runs for public office,
and because he's notably rich, he wins.

No, wait, wait a minute.

Notably rich and powerful
can't win over an audience

unless notably rich and powerful sees
the error of his ways in the final reel.

Notably rich and powerful

and making no goddamn excuses
for it is only admirable in real life.

Isn't that right, Louis?


So what do we do?

Anybody?

We give him ideals.

Ideals that any dirt-poor,

depression-weary audience
can identify with.

Our Quixote is against crooked trusts.

He's for the eight-hour workday,
fair income tax, better schools.

Why, he's even
for government ownership of railroads.


You know what we call those people?

[man] Communists?
[woman] Anarchists?

No, our Quixote,
he's a two-fisted muckraker.

In fact, someone predicts
that he will one day

win the presidency
and bring about, get thisâ€¦


â€¦a socialist revolution.

What a bunch of bullshit!
Is it?

Tell him, Willie.

Tell him.

Upton Sinclair used exactly those words

to describe
a young William Randolph Hearst.

You miserable bastard!
How do you do?

Our Quixote, he hungers, he thirsts,

he lusts for voters to love him.

Love him enough to make him president.

But they won't, and they don't.

How do you suppose that could happen?

Could it be because, in their hearts,

they know
that he values power over people?

Disillusioned in Congress,

he authors not one
single piece of legislation in two terms.

Can you believe that?
That'll take some writing.

Placed in nomination for president,

but it's too radical
for the boys in the back.

His bid goes nowhere,
but we're doing something.

We're building sympathy.

Rejected, he flees to lotusland,

where his faithful troll, Sancho,

has prepared a mythical kingdom forâ€¦

Wait a minute.

I forgot the love interest.

Her nameâ€¦

Dulcinea.

Funny, adventurous, smarter than she acts.

Ah, she's aâ€¦

She's a showgirl,
beneath his social stratum,

but that's okay,

because true love on the big screens,

we all know, is blind.

And sheâ€¦

Yeah, she loves him too.

So he takes her away
to his mythical kingdom.

Can I get a bicarb?

Now, along comes nemesis.

That's Greek for any guy in a black hat.

Nemesis runs for governor
and he's a shoo-in to win.

Why? Because he's exactly
what our Don used to be.

An idealist, you get it?

And not only that,

nemesis is the same guy
who once predicted our Quixote would

one day preside over
a socialist revolution.

Our Quixote looks
into the mirror of his youth

and decides to break this glass,

a maddening reminder of who he once was.

Assisted by his faithful Sancho,

and armed
with all the black magic at his command,

he does just this.

Destroying in the process
not one manâ€¦ but two.

Well, what do you think, Louis?

Hmm?

You think it'll play?


[vomiting continues]

[guests groan and clamor]

[Mank sighs, chuckling]
Don't worry, folks.

Uh, the white wine came up with the fish.

Who the fuck do you think
you are, Mankiewicz?

You're nothin' but a court jester.

And let me let you in on a little secret.

Do you have any idea
who pays half your salary?

He pays half your fucking salary.

Him, you fucking ingrate.

You didn't know that, did ya?
You wanna know why?

Because he likes the way you talk.

Not the way you write, the way you talk.

Don't that chap your ass?

[indistinct conversation]

[Rita] Please, follow me.
[Welles] It's very quaint.

Rise and shine, <i>hombre.</i>

Shoot-out at the O.K. Corral.

Before we buckle down, I gather you have
something to get off your chest?

As a matter of fact, I do.

I think what I said upset you.

I know your health's not what it might be.
I understand that comes first.

Really?
[Welles] This studio fuss, this lawsuit.

God only knows
what pressure's yet to come.

At your age,
you'd be justified in wanting out.

I'm 43, but that's very understanding.

Mayer's buyout was rejected.

So, the fat's only starting
to hit the fire.

Now, I talked to RKO, and I'll tell you
what they're ready to do.

In recognition of the outstanding work
you've done so far,

they're prepared to relieve you of
the rewrite and still honor your full pay,

plus $10,000.

How's that?

That's more than generous.

But I don't intend to walk.

All right.

What's bothering you, then?

You're not going to like this, Orson.


I want credit.

Come again?

It's the best thing I've ever written.

Jack, get me some Cuban cigars.

In Victorville?
Do what you can, Jack.

Oh, stay, Houseman.
You'll miss the third act complicator.

Get going, Jack. <i>Muy pronto.</i>

I believe that means right away.

[tense music playing]

Mank, Mank.

in sorrow than in anger, Willie.

Are you familiar with the parable
of the organ grinder's monkey?

Now, the organ grinder's monkey
is tiny in stature,

and having been taken from the wild,

he's naturally overwhelmed
by the enormous world around him.

But every morning, a sweet elderly woman
dresses him in a fine suit of clothes.

She fits him with a red velvet vest
adorned with pearl buttons

and a handsome red fez with a silk tassel.

She slips on brocade shoes
that curl at the toe,

and he's paired with a fine gilt music box
on an exquisite gold chain

fastened to his neck and his neck alone.

Whenever he ventures
into the city to perform,

he thinks,
"What a powerful fellow I must be."

"Look how patiently
everyone waits just to watch me dance."

Hey, Willie...

"And wherever I go," he thinks,

"this music box must follow, and with it,
this poor downtrodden man."

"And if I chose not to dance,
this sorry street peddler would starve,

and every time
I do decide to dance, every timeâ€¦

He must play."

"Whether he wishes to or not."

You've had a bit too much
to drink, Herman.

I'll get Raymond
to drive you to the station.

Goodbye.


Put aside gratitude, Mank.

That you've done your best work
was no accident.

I removed any distraction,
eliminated every excuse,

your family, your cronies, liquor.

I gave you a second chance.

And for that, I cannot thank you enough.

But with credit for a risky undertaking
must go the weight of real responsibility.

Given your current health,
I wonder if you're up to it.

Frankly, I wonder, too,
but we'll find out.

You may never work
in this town again, Mank!


Then you force me to remind you!

We have a contract
that you understood and agreed to!

If you fight this, it will go
to what your new guild calls arbitration,

and you, my friend,
will lose script, money,

and assuming such a thing still exists
in Hollywood,

the respect of those who honor their word.

How can I put this nicely?

I may be a loose cannon,

but you, my friend, are an outsider.

They're exasperated by me,
and I've earned it,

but you, a self-anointed savior-hyphenate,

they're just waiting to loathe you.

Remind me never again
to work with a washed-up alcoholic!

Duly noted. Nelson Algren, please copy.

All right!
No doubt you'll get your credit.

But ask yourself,
"Who's producing this picture?"

"Directing it? Starring in it?"

That's just what we need
when Susan leaves Kane.

An act of purging violence.

Maybe.

[kicking glass shards]

[door slams]


Mank, come quick!

[car engine starts]

He's alive!

Ian's alive!

He fetched up on the Orkneys!
The what?

The Orkney Islands, you idiot.

Oh, Mank, are you ever serious?

Only about something funny.
[sighs exasperatedly]

[audience applauding]

{\an8}[typewriter dings]

[clears throat] And the winner
of the best original screenplay isâ€¦

Herman J. Mankiewiczâ€¦
[audience applauding]

â€¦and Orson Welles for <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

<i>and first win</i>

<i>for Mr. Mankiewicz and Mr. Welles.</i>

<i>Neither were able to attend tonight.</i>

<i>Accepting for both
is the president of RKO Radio Pictures,</i>

<i>Mr. George Schaefer.</i>

[reporter] <i>Excuse me, Mr. Welles.</i>
[real Orson Welles] <i>Good morning.</i>

{\an8}[reporter] <i>Good morning, Mr. Welles.</i>
<i>You missed a big night.</i>

{\an8}[real Orson Welles] <i>I was unable to attend</i>
<i>the Academy Awards</i>

{\an8}<i>because I'm here in Rio
making a marvelous motion picture.</i>

{\an8}[reporter] Kane <i>was nominated</i>
<i>in nine categories, including best actor.</i>

{\an8}<i>Aren't you disappointed
that it only won one Oscar?</i>

{\an8}[real Orson Welles]
<i>Well, that, my good man, is Hollywood.</i>

{\an8}[men laughing]

{\an8}[reporter] <i>Anything you'd like to say</i>
<i>to your coauthor, Mr. Mankiewicz?</i>

{\an8}[real Orson Welles] <i>I do have a message.</i>
<i>You may tell him from meâ€¦</i>

{\an8}<i>Mank, you can kiss my half!</i>

{\an8}[men laughing]

You ask me what
my acceptance speech might have been.

Well, here goes.

I am very happy to accept this award

in the manner
in which the screenplay was written,

which is to say,
in the absence of Orson Welles.

How's that?
[reporter] How come he shares credit?

is the magic of the movies.

[man laughs]

Big smile.
