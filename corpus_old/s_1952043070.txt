Don't move! You are under arrest!

I don't why Maya is not
answering the phone!

Must be parking her car!

Or maybe she is stuck
in traffic.

But she should at least
answer her phone!

Maybe it's on silent mode.

It's been an hour.
She has still not arrived.

I don't know what it is.

I think her watch has stopped.

Or maybe she told
you in your dream...

...that she is coming to receive
you at the airport.

You are joking!?
Oh!

Feels good.

Feels good.

Vavoom.

I feels good.

You take a cab and leave.
I will wait here.

Okay!

Cab!

Feels good.

42nd Street!

Excuse me! Can I share the cab with you?
Sure!

Thank you! Thank you!

Maya! Maya!

You are here!

I was waiting for you at the
airport for the past 2 hours!

You were going to
come to receive me!

I should have come to
receive whom, Neel?

A thief!
A fraud or a womaniser!

What has happened to you?
Are you okay?

I will tell you if I
am okay or not! Okay!

What is this? What is this?
What is this?

Just see it for yourself, Neel!

Will you still say you
didn't do anything?

Maya, all this... this...

This is not what you think it is!
Trust me on that!

Till date, I have being
trusting you, Neel!

Had I known before that you
don't deserve my trust...

...then it wouldn't have
hurt me so much today!

But I have told you everything!

You have hurt me, Neel!
You have really hurt me!

Now how do I explain to you that...

I had explained to you, Neel!

That leaving a job of 2 lakhs
dollars you are going to India.

But you didn't understand.
Maya.

But today I have understood!

You wanted to earn
crores using fraud!

Oh shut up, Maya!
What do you mean shut up?

Tanvi has done all this!

So that Jordan loses respect for me.

You have lost that respect.

And along with yourself you
have disgraced me too!

Do you know because of you
I can't venture out of the house!

I can't go to college!

People ask me, why did
you love such a man?

Look into my eyes!
Do you think I am a fraud?

I don't regret what people
think about me!

I regret that you have
misunderstood me.

Yes. Because truth is
in front of my eyes.

Try and believe me.
Shut up, Neel!

Just... now I don't want to
hear any justification!

Just go away!
Just get out of here!

Maya!

Sir! We are ready to close!
Yes!

Arrest him!

It's all a pack of lies, officer!

I have not done anything wrong!
Please believe me!

I am innocent!

I have heard that lie
a thousand times!

Every criminal says that!

But I am not a criminal, officer!

I am telling the truth! Please
try and believe me!

Believe me, officer!
Neel is innocent!

If you don't believe me,
you can ask anybody!

What is your relationship with Neel?

I am his friend, his brother,
his everything!

Since childhood we
have never parted!

This is the first time
that we have parted!

He is in prison and I am outside!

I beg you, officer! Release him!
Neel is not a fraud!

Attorney, tell him!
I want to meet him now!

Sorry. Investigation is on.
You can't meet him.

Officer, along with Neel
investigate me too!

Are you kidding?
Are you joking?

I am not kidding!
I am serious, sir!

What law is this!
Somebody filed a report against Neel!

And you arrested him!

And when I want to file
a report against myself...

...then why don't you arrest me?

Mr. Sunny, what are you doing?

What can I do, sir?
My friend is being framed!

And you want me to sit quietly!

Mr. Sunny, don't waste time!

Now shall we go and find the man...

...because of whom Neel is framed.

Yes. I am fed up with this boy!

Rajesh!

Tanvi! Attorney, Tanvi!
It's Tanvi!

Tanvi?
Who is she?

She is the woman who has done
all this and framed me!

She has destroyed me, my
love life, my career!

Everything!
She has ruined me, officer!

Mr. Neel, if you are innocent,
I promise you...

...you will come to no harm.

So tell us. What happened?
The whole truth.

And nothing but the truth
from the beginning.

It all started with Kumar.

My mentor and my guide!

Thank you!
Thank you very much!

My book is about a thought of mine...

...that has consumed me for years.

You see, there are three kinds
of people in this world.

People who make things happen.

People who watch things happen.

And people who just
wonder what happened.

People who make things happen...

...are the ones who are
called dreamers.

Dreamers make the world go around.

It's our God given
responsibility to dream.

It's your responsibility to dream!

It's your responsibility to dream!

And it's your responsibility
to dream!

Don't you dream?
Yes!

Well, this book has been a dream
of mine for many years!

And now it's a reality.
It's come true.

And your dream will come true too.

Thank you! Thank you very much!

Mr. Kumar, will your dream come
true through this book?

Well, it's a great start.

But my dream will come true when...

...through my book, people's
dreams will come true.

What happened?
Quickly!

Commotion in New York!

Guys, its Mr. Kumar!
Kumar sir! Kumar sir!

Mr. Kumar!
Kumar sir! Kumar sir!

Kumar!

Nice meeting you, sir!
Sir! Sir!

Sir, he is a very big fan of yours.

Sir!

If there is a problem at 3 in
the night, he needs Mr. Kumar!

Thank you, sir!
He needs Mr. Kumar!

Thank you!
Today we are meeting you personally!

Mr. Kumar!

Any message for us, sir?

You are young and smart!
You must dream big!

And let those dreams move from
your head to your heart!

And then just follow your heart!
Okay!

Sorry about that!

Hi!

And...

Go ahead!
Thank you!

By the way I am Neel!

Could I use your cell for a second?
Yes! Sure!

Thanks! Got it!

Got it!

'He gave me his number
and he took my number.'

You are too much!

...How much time has passed
since this incident?

Maybe a year!

Tomorrow is Valentines day.
What are you gifting me?

What? You should gift me!

I mean girls don't give gifts

You could me the first one!
Yes! Sure!

Okay!

Anyplace in Manhattan!

Yes!

I will tell you something and
you will go mad, Neel! I swear!

What?
Sit! Sit! Sit!

Okay!

Listen, what a girl!
What a figure!

We met and she said yes
in the first meeting!

Is that so?
Superb! Believe me!

Tomorrow we are going for dinner!

Going for dinner?
I will tell Tina!

Hey! I am serious about Tina!
I am serious, dude!

Is that so?
Believe me, dude!

So go and call her.
No.

I am going to uncle's place
in New Jersey in the evening.

You too come for dinner.
We will eat and talk too.

It will be fun.

Message me the number. I will come.

But I don't have a cell.

It fell in the water
and it got damaged.

You give your number please!

Excuse me! Pen please!
Pen please!

Is the food good?
Yes, aunt.

Dear, it feels so good. Come
here for meals everyday.

If I come everyday then
when will I study?

You don't pass though you study.

Uncle, this year I will pass.

Fool! Were you born reverse?

Why are you eating from
the other hand?

Uncle!
Yes!

I have a special's person's
number on the other hand.

I will finish my meals and
feed it in my cell. Okay.

Special number?

Yes! Very special! You
can say it's my life.

Is it a girl's number?

Uncle, you too!

This guy felt shy. Tell me!

It's not important for
the girl to be Punjabi.

Anyone will do.

It will be perfectly fine.

I will handle your father,
my brother.

I will open the door.

Aunt, who is it?
Hello, aunt.

Greetings!
Greetings!

Hi, Sunny!
Neel! Uncle!

Neel!

Uncle! He is my special friend!
Hello, uncle.

You can say that Neel is my life!

There is a separate room upstairs.
I have some work.

Shall we go?

Yes.
One second.

Uncle, don't disturb us. Okay.

Don't disturb us. Okay, aunt!

You will go mad!

Are you thinking what I am thinking?

What are you thinking?

My brother sent this fool
to America trusting me.

If this guy got slandered then
we too will be slandered.

You are right.

You stay here. I will go and check.
Okay.

Protect us.

Dial the number.
Are you mad?

Will your parents let
you marry a foreigner?

What's the problem?
What's the problem?

If you don't want me to marry, fine.

But what's the harm in having
fun before marriage, dude?

God, what am I hearing!

Do one thing. Call her.
What's that fair girl's name?

I will tell you what to say.

Why are you standing there?
Come on the bed!

Yes.

First tell me what to say?

This fool!

What happened?

Terrible!
What happened?

It's terrible!
Tell me what happened?

I thought my nephew
is a meek fellow.

But that fool is a gay!

No, no. I can't believe this.

You don't believe it.
No.

Hear it for yourself.

Come. Hear it.

Darling, you love me too?

I love you madly, deeply, truly.
Hey! Hey!

Where are you going?
Where are you going?

You will be in trouble!
You will be in trouble!

Where are you going?

Uncle! Aunt! Had any work?

You have slandered us!

You have tarnished
our family's image!

This guy has ruined his life!
Me?

Stop! Calm down!

Hang on! Listen to me!

Calm down!
You harass me in this old age!

...Calm down! Calm down!

Neel! Listen!

I was looking for you, dude!
Why? What happened?

Yesterday my cell gave me a problem!

And my uncle too!

Your uncle had gone mad yesterday!

If you will hear this, you
will fall down, dude!

Why? What happened?

He is thinking we are gay!
What!

Yes! You are laughing!

You look like one!

He is thinking you are
the main boss, dude!

You have spoilt me!

That uncle is crazy!

What will he do?
He is a dangerous man!

Just be aware! Be careful of him!
Okay!

Hey!

Sweetheart!
Hi!

I will just come!
I will meet you later!

Just be careful! Be aware!
Be aware! Remember that!

Be careful, Neel!

Sorry!

He ran away! Oh God!

Hey! Oh God!

Neel!
Run! Run!

Now at least tell me, Neel!

I will tell you!

Neel! Why are we running?
I will tell you!

And who were they?
I will tell you! Let me catch my breath!

No! Tell me now!

Shall I tell you?
Yes!

Shall I tell you?
Yes!

Think!
Yes!

Your tresses are wet, wet, wet.

Bangles on your fair,
fair, fair hands.

On your lips, this tint,
tint, tint.

There is no such tint
in the whole world.

Smile once and say yes.

I won't ask anything
else from God.

Your tresses are wet, wet, wet.

Bangles on your fair,
fair, fair hands.

On the lanes of stars.

You have walked.

On the ground of my fancy.

How do I thank you?

Stealing from the springs.

You have brought fragrance.

I was searching for you
since a long time.

You have made me crazy.

Once smile and say yes.

I won't ask anything
else from God.

Your tresses are wet, wet, wet.

Bangles on your fair,
fair, fair hands.

I will dwell you in my shelter.

I will adorn you on my lips.

Today I will do insolence.

But my heart is afraid.

I will caress your tresses.

I will lose control.

I will embrace you today.

If you give me the sign.

Smile once and say yes.

I won't ask anything
else from God.

Your tresses are wet, wet, wet.

Bangles on your fair,
fair, fair hands.

On your lips, this tint,
tint, tint.

There is no such tint
in the whole world.

a lesson! You are nobody!

Uncle! Aunt! You and here?

In India! Shut up!

In India he made 5 girls pregnant!
You!

Sunny, I don't want to see
your face ever again!

Get out of here!
No!

I am leaving!

She slapped me too!

Sunny, I don't want to see
your face ever again!

Please! Please! Please!

Listen! Listen! Listen!

Tina, listen! Please!

How could you, Sunny?

You slept with all those girls
and made them pregnant!

Tina, that was Mary!
My ex-girlfriend!

I told you about her!
I didn't make her pregnant!

You are lying. Your uncle told me.

You slept with 4-5 girls and
made all of them pregnant.

Such a stupid uncle!
I will kick him!

I swear to God!
Have I made you pregnant till now?

You know me!
I am very serious about you!

I love you so much!
I love you so much!

Last time, Sunny!

And if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be here now.

Thank you!
I can't live without you!

Neel, I repair it every time!

Neel, I always fix this
but you spoil it.

Tell me something, Neel.

It's been one year.

You didn't tell me anything
about your parents.

Mother passed away when
I was eight years old.

I am sorry.

My dad brought me up.

He didn't get married again.

But he is more like a friend to me.

That's so sweet.

Is this book yours?
Yes.

Interesting.

Can I borrow it?
Yes sure, why not.

But don't lose it and don't
lend it to anyone.

Grandma has given it to me,
so keep it properly.

You know, I won't.

Alright, I think you are all set.

I have fixed the wires.

Don't spoil it again, okay.

I will see you tomorrow.
Okay.

Thank you. Take care.

See you.
See you.

Don't be late.
Bye.

Oh no.

There he is.

Neel.
Uncle, how are you?

Where is your useless friend, Sunny?

Just tell me, what he is doing with
that foreigner girl.

Tell us son.

You are mistaken.

I am mistaken or are you
aiding your friend.

Where is Sunny?

He must be on his way.

Maya has forgotten her keys.

I will just go and
return it to her.

Please hold.
Go and give it to her.

Return it to her quickly.

I have some business with you.

Definitely uncle, you just hold on.

I will be back in 2 minutes.

Go son.

Sunny!

I want to have the best
time of my life.

Come on.

Kiss me.

Oh God, I feel ashamed!

How they have embraced each other.

Why are you feeling ashamed
if they are embracing?

Separate them! Separate them!

What do you want me to do,
go inside the computer?

You idiot, what are you are doing?
What a nice girl.

I am feeling jealous.

Sunny.

Just a minute.

Who is disturbing me now?

Hi dad.

Son, you have floored your dad.

What? I didn't understand dad.

Where are you? And
what are you doing?

I am studying dad, in the library.

I can see that.

What are you studying for, son.

For MBA, dad.

So, in MBA you have
to study medical too?

No.

You fool, then why are
you feeling her nerves?

What?

Tell me the truth, where are you?

I am in the library, dad.

What are you doing?
Studying.

I have made up my mind
that this year...

...I have to top in MBA
and become Anil Ambani.

You think so much, son.

Anil Ambani brought Tina after...

...but you brought Tina...

...before you could
become Anil Ambani.

How can you become Anil Ambani?

Don't look here and there.

I and your mother can see
everything that you are doing.

Yes.

Have you come to America?

Don't jump.

Why aren't you talking, son?

Sorry guys.

All three of them are there now.

God!

Bad news guys, the web-cam was on.
What about your youth now!

Disconnected the phone.

Have fun.

I am dead.

Neel, this time on birthday you
will take me to Hawaii islands.

Of course I will.

Why just Hawaii, I will
take you to Macau.

It will really be cool.

Here is your mall.
Come on.

So tell me.
Do your shopping.

Tell me, Neel.

Neel, please.

Hey Neel, look at that guy.

Why has he come in a woman's store?

Do you like him?

No way, I hate boys with earrings.

I thought you want me
to wear earrings too.

Come on.

Wow, so beautiful.

Who, me?

No, the scarf's.

Look, aren't they cute.

You mean not me.

I don't mean that.

Tell me Neel, how is it?

Beautiful.

Who are you referring to,
me or the scarf?

The scarf.

I am joking, you are so beautiful...

...any scarf will look good on you.

Really.

Then tell me, which colour you like.

Look, this one is good.
Nice.

There are two of them.

But both are alike.

There is a 50% discount,
take both of them.

Neel, you are too much.
Come on.

Promise me.

You will always keep it with
you as my memorabilia.

Wherever you go in life, a part
of me will always be with you.

Why do you watch so many films?

How mean, Neel.

Come on, promise me.

I promise you.

Let's go, come on.

I am Sunny's uncle.

You called me.

Why are you staring at me?

You...
What happened?

Get out! Get out! Get out!

Surprising! First of
all you call people...

...and then you throw them out.

You think I am a fool.
What?

Am I a fool?

You have come wearing
this white hair wig.

What are you saying?

You are trying to fool me.
That's not it.

Take it off!
Take it off!

You idiot.

You are pulling my hair.

I will see how you resist!
Hey, hey!

Hey officer, look have you gone mad!

Have you gone mad!

You are pulling my hair.

Troubling an old man.

What's your problem?
Sorry.

Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

The hair is real.

You think they are fake?

I have bought it from somewhere.

Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

Your face... face...

It looks exactly like Sunny.

Officer. Sunny's father
and I are twins.

Okay.

And Sunny is the triplet.

Take a seat.

Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

You must have felt bad that
I pulled your hair, isn't it.

You must have felt bad.

Forgive me.

You think I will feel happy.

I am sorry.

Your hair is real, but
the problem is that...

...I feel very bad because
I am an Indian.

And a student counsellor.

So whenever I see
an Indian student...

...going on the wrong path,
I feel very bad.

That's why I have called you.

Please explain to him.

Please explain to him.

What should I explain
to him, officer?

What should I explain to him?

Sunny hasn't come to America
to make us proud.

He has come here to defame
us and our family name.

That's what I am telling you.

He has been failing
for the past 3 years.

He doesn't study, then
how can he pass.

What kind of an uncle are you?

Take a look, what kind
of an uncle am I?

Explain him, that's what
I am telling you.

I can't explain to him.

Listen to me, first listen to me.

I will shoot him.

Don't shoot him.

Yesterday, he was caught in
the bathroom with a girl.

What are you saying?
I am telling the truth.

Please say it once more.

Yesterday, he was caught in
the bathroom with a girl.

My Sunny was caught with
a girl in the bathroom.

Congratulations! Congratulations!

My family is saved from being gay.

My Sunny is not a gay!

My Sunny is not a gay!

Thank you, waiting for me.

Tina baby.

I don't want to talk to you now.

Why?

I couldn't sleep last night.

Because you embarrassed me
in front of your family.

No, no, no it's not my fault.

You know, my mom and dad
gave me a lecture about...

...the need for me to settle
down everything.

I think they are right.

Laugh please, forgive me. Laugh.

This is for you.
Thank you.

And this is for you.
Thank you.

And now I have to say something.

Would you marry me, Tina baby?

What happened now?
Come on, come on, come on.

Sunny...
Fast, fast, fast.

Sunny, where are you taking me?

What's the matter?
Sunny.

What's going on, Sunny?

Sunny Wait for me.

Wait for me, Sunny.

Come on, come on.

Why are we walking so fast?

It's very good for health.

Makes your happy.

Wait.

What are you talking about?

It's great timing baby.

What?
What?

I will tell you later?

Come on, come on.
Come.

Sunny!

Sunny!

Come.

Sunny.

Sunny, what's going on?

Hey Sunny, cheers.

Hey Neel, how are you?
How is it going?

Hi.

What's up?
Hi.

What are these flowers and all for?

Yes, I already proposed to her.

No you didn't.

We started to run for a marathon.
What?

Okay, okay.

I want to say to you in
front of all my friends.

Tina, will you marry me?

Come on, come on.

Yes.

I love you.

Three cheers for Sunny.

Why is he running?

He is always running.

What?

Crazy guy, running away
from beautiful girls.

I don't know.

Sunny!

Sunny, where are you?

Sunny.

Hey Sweetie, have a seat.

Thanks.

Good.

Same here.

So how's your day been going?

You are looking really good.

Something is weird.

There is something weird.

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

Stop it.

What's going on?

What is that?

What are you doing?

Look, what is there.

What are you doing?

That's my helmet.

That's my helmet.

Stop the guy, stop.

That's my helmet, you idiot.

Stop, where are you going?

He dropped my helmet.

You rogue.

You rogue, get down here I will...

Stop, stop that. What are you doing?

Stop.

Stop!

Stop!

Drive slowly!

I am saved, better late than never.

Thanks a lot.

No, no don't thank me.

Uncle Jordan himself asked me
that he wants to see you.

So Neel...

...I heard from the head of
the Columbia university...

...who happens to be a very
good friend of mine.

You are quite a student.

I am just a...

But I am a venture capitalist...

...and a very successful one at that.

I spent a couple of
weeks over in India.

With some really high
profile people.

It's a hot bed for investment.

Yes, I would agree to that.

Exactly, so I would like to
know if you are interested...

...in starting what I want.

The next international wave
of business investment.

A call centre.

This is the India project.

Wow, India project.

What did you want to say?
Say it.

What happened?
Neel, listen.

No intelligent man will
take such a risky step...

...like you are going to do.

Why? What happened?
I didn't understand.

Neel, you have received a job
offer of 2 lakh dollars.

I was so happy.

And when I told my dad about
it, he was so happy.

The negative thought that
he had about you...

...I saw it turning positive.

When he will come to know
that you have denied...

...such a nice job offer
and are going to India...

...then what will he think?

He will think negatively
about me again!

Neel.

Look Maya, the company that
has given me this offer...

...knows what my worth is.

And I think this is
a good opportunity.

I don't want to let go of it.

Neel, I know you are brilliant.

But business is a gamble.

You can have success and
be unsuccessful too.

If every person starts
thinking this way...

...then who will do business.

You can do a business here too.

But I have received an
offer for India, Maya.

What are you saying?

I don't want to miss
this opportunity.

Yes, you are right.

Even if you have to miss me.

Maya!

Neel, you don't understand.

Dad will never send me to India.

I am not going to India
to get settled there.

I am going to India to
setup a call centre.

I can come back here...

...and manage my business
from here too.

And right now I need
your support Maya...

...and not your lecture.

Neel.

I support you.

But I will really miss you Neel.

I will miss you too.

I love you

Come in, Jordan.

Hello Neel, come on in.

How are you doing today?

I, have transferred 10
million US dollars...

...into a bank account in India.

What. This is the bank information.

Wow.

And these are first class tickets
for you and your team.

Great.

Good luck Neel.
Thank you so much.

Thank you. Thank you.

We will rock you.

We will shock you.

We will rock you.

Meet the county guys!

We go to the things that rock!

What are you going to do,
where are you going to go.

We will rock you.

We will rock you.

We will shock you.

We will shock you.

We will rock you.

We will shock you.

This is our world.

This is where we live.

In our happiness, we
forget out sorrows.

We are different then everyone.

It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

We will rock you.

We will shock you.

We will rock you.

We will shock you.

There is zest and obsession
filled in us.

We live in our dream world.

Sometimes we think, sometimes
we understand.

Let's have some fun.

It's the ambiance of merriment.

It's the intoxication of love.

We always listen to our heart.

It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

We will rock you.

We will shock you.

We will rock you.

We will shock you.

What is right, what is wrong...

We know that very well.

Whoever calls us naive?

He is naive himself.

We are crazy; we can
make the sky kneel.

Stop the storm, if we
make up our minds.

It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

It's our world. It's our world.
It's our world. It's our world.

We will rock you.

We will shock you.

We will rock you.

We will shock you.

I like it, wow.

Rajesh, you are great.

This is Tanvi.

Wow.

Sister-in-law is really great.

This is not sister-in-law,
she is not my wife.

Then is she a model?

She is posing like a model.

Keep quiet.

She can work in films too.

You can say that she is my partner.

Partner.

I search for clients here in US. Ok

And she looks after my BPO in India.

She will help you in every way.

That's great.

Then our work has become easier.

When the girl is beautiful,
everything becomes easier.

Keep quiet.

She makes everything possible.

She is the most successful
call centre manager.

And a lovely person to work with.

Do you have all your paperwork...

...and money in order?

Yes, everything.

Great. I will see you in India.

I didn't understand.

You are coming to India too.

Of course, I am going to India
by tomorrow's flight.

Wow, that's great.

Great.
Then let's go together.

Thank you, sir.

Nice talking to you sir.

But your selection is very nice.
Thank you so much.

I see, so you met this
lady Tanvi in India.

Yes officer. And I am sure
she is in America...

...because her partner Rajesh,
who introduced me to her...

...had also come to America.

Send the girl.

I am telling you the truth officer,
this is the woman!

She is responsible for everything.

Officer, she is the
one that framed me.

I am not going to leave her!
I am going to kill her!

Control yourself, Mr. Neel.

Neel!
Cool down.

Ms. Tanvi, is it true.,

...that you have framed Mr. Neel?

I tried, but he was already
in love with Maya.

Answer the question.

No, I have not framed him.

He is lying.

I am not lying, officer,
she is the one lying.

Mr. Neel, please be quiet. Please.

So madam, do you mean to say...

...that you have not
committed the fraud.

No, a thousand times no!

Ms. Tanvi, we have many
ways to find the truth.

Because you have committed
the fraud...

...it's better for you that
you accept your crime.

If he would have listened to me...

...then I wouldn't have done
anything like this.

And this wouldn't have
happened with him.

Tanvi Kapoor can tolerate
everything...

...but not her insult.

And that's why I had to do all this.

Gentlemen, this is Tanvi.

Oh baby! Yes!

Hi.
Tanvi, this is Neel.

Hello.
Hi!

'Till today, boys would
be mesmerised seeing me.'

'But today he has floored me.'

This is Sunny.

Hello.
Hi.

Enough! Enough! Enough!

Tanvi...
Such a long time for shaking hands.

Such a long time to embrace.

This is not fair, man.

Tanvi, this is Soy Chi.
Hi.

This is a 2007 machine.

And this is Pat.

Hi.

Hello.
He is completely stupid.

I am joking.

I have arranged for all
of you to stay here.

All of you rest now, tomorrow...

...we will go to the
call centre together.

Okay, I will see you.

Okay, see you.
Bye.

Bye. Ok

Good.

Look at this.

Very nice

The money that Mr. Jordan had sent...

...I have used it so well; you
can see it for yourself.

Yes, I can see that.
Thank you.

Amazing.
Thank you.

Wow. Jordan, I feel proud of you.

Thank you.

You have set up everything so well...

...that we can start
our work right now.

And yes, I have readied
the database...

...of the clients of US, Europe
and the Middle-East.

wow Very good.

Neel, come I will show
you your office.

And we have to do some important
discussion too.

Okay.

How many cabins are there?

Yes, this is your cabin.

Very nice, dude.

Fantastic! Fantastic, dude!

I have made all the arrangements.

You can start taking the
interviews from today.

Thank you very much, Tanvi.

No thanks.

I have done all this just for you.

Only for you.

Why this?

Whomever I like, I capture him.

You didn't understand?

You will.

Bye.

Please come again.

I want to see everything.

Okay guys.
Nice.

Let's get on with it.

We will have to start the
interviews today itself.

Today.
Yes.

Next.

You are hired.

Yes, you are hired.

You are hired.
Thank you.

You are hired.
You are hired.

Good afternoon, Mr. Kingston.
You are hired.

May I know which system do you use?

Yes You are hired.

You are hired. Yes.

Sunny!
Yes.

I am going to the loo, sit here.

Okay, take care.

Hello sir.

Hello.

Sit please.
Thank you.

So...
So!

So.
You called me.

I called you!

Yes, the bell.

Oh, so you have come hearing the bell.
Yes.

Then I will take this
bell to the bedroom.

Should we start?

What, fun?

No, interview.

Very smart.

You are very smart.

You are selected.

Come on, come on.

You are selected.

Hey Soy, what's up?

Hey Neel...

Tanvi has been calling you
for the past 2 hours...

...because your phone was off range.

What did she say?

She said she has some urgent
matter to discuss with you.

She wants you to go over
to her place tonight.

Right away.

Okay. I will go see her.
Okay.

Tanvi.

I am there.

You are there.

It's a moonlit night.

What can I do?

What can I do?

What can I do?

Do you need to think about that?

Do you need to think about that?

I am there.

You are there.

Come, come, come in my arms.

Don't make my heart restless.

There is a bit of fun.

And a bit of eagerness.

The ambiance is crazy.

My tresses are swaying.

My desires are out of control.

We both are young.

What can I do?

What can I do?

What can I do?

Do you need to think about that?

Do you need to think about that?

There are smolders and passion
between the breaths.

Now I can't endure the warm sighs.

It's a beautiful ambiance.

A wonderful mood.

Love is scattered everywhere.

My heart is crazy for you.

My troubled heartbeat says.

I cannot tolerate the distance
anymore, darling.

What can I do?

What can I do?

What can I do?

Do you need to think about that?

Do you need to think about that?

Hi Maya.

Hi babes, I love you.
I love you too.

I was missing you a lot today.

I was thinking you must have
found another girl there.

Sweetheart, this is an Indian heart.

It lives one time and dies one time.

And only you reside in my heart.

Never forget that.

Yes, I will call you back.
I will call you back.

Okay Neel, take care, bye.

You too, bye.

Eat, eat like gluttons.

How much are you eating?

I am not eating, they are eating.

The both of them.
The food is tasty.

Eat carefully, take care
of your stomach...

...usually foreigners cannot
digest Indian food.

What?

Come on, hurry up.
Spicy man.

You will only fart like animals.

You don't believe it.

Then eat, eat this too.

Don't do that, he will die.

eat Guys, guys, take it easy.

Come on guys, hurry up.

Careful dear.

Come brother.

I am elder to you.

Elder brother.

Why did you bring me here
from the airport?

After reaching Pune, I
would have eaten food...

...cooked by sister-in-law.
Keep quiet.

You are coming directly
from America.

After travelling for 20 hours,
you must be hungry.

But why did you come alone?

Why didn't you bring that
useless Sunny along?

Brother, I couldn't
get through to him.

And when I went to his house,
it was locked.

I was thinking, if you would
have brought Sunny along...

...then I would have beaten him...

...all the way from Mumbai to Pune.

Their appetite is different.

What has happened to him?

Pat! Pat!
Pat, are you okay?

What happened?

What happened, Pat?

My stomach's paining.

I had told you. But
you didn't listen.

You were eating like
an animal, dude.

I will take him.

What?

I will take him to the doctor.
C'mon Pat. C'mon. Let's go.

Just see, if the stomach
gets cured...

...otherwise operate on him
and take the food out.

Waiter.

Yes sir.
What yes...

I am dead.

America India together.

Sunny, if you are caught they
will thrash you like Osama.

Waiter.
Yes sir.

Come here.
Come here.

Will you change clothes with me?

Will you change clothes with me?

I didn't understand.

You wear my goggles, and
I will wear your turban.

And when we pay the bill, then
you can have your turban...

...and return me my goggles.

Go.

Waiter.

Waiter.

Waiter.

You won't die if you don't
eat for a little while.

Can't you hear?

Yes.

Why have you hidden your face?

Will you place the order seeing
my face? Tell me what will you eat?

He is very manner-less.

Manner-less.

Manner-less people like you...

...will have manner-less children.

What will you have?

Pen please.

Tell me.

I don't think you are a waiter.

I have to become a waiter
for people like you.

Tell me, what you will have.

One butter chicken.

And 4 baked bread.

And bring it quickly.
Go.

Is that a dish too?
Hurry up?

Oh, it was those lousy goat balls.

Feeling a lot better though.

I am glad.

Hello.
Hi sweetheart.

I miss you so much. I miss you to.

Tell me, are you speaking
from the call centre?

No, from the hospital.

Hospital!

What has happened to you Neel?

Nothing, Pat's stomach was upset.

He had eaten goat-balls.

How is he feeling now?

He is better, he just needs to rest.

Neel, papa.
I will call you back.

Okay, okay.

Whom were you talking to, dear?

With Neel.

Something wrong, papa?

Dear, its better that you don't
have any relation with Neel.

Papa.

What are you saying?

The same thing I explained
to Neel with my experience.

And now I am explaining to you too.

Neel is not worthy of you.

Papa, how can you say
that about Neel?

Then why did he go to
India from America.

For business.
No, for the greed of money.

Because he was getting more
money there than here.

Papa, Neel is not such a boy.

He is a nice guy.

Look dear, I don't
want to argue on...

...whether Neel is a nice boy or not.

I have come to tell you that...

...I have found a Catholic
boy for you.

Papa, you know that
I love Neel a lot.

I am sure that after marriage...

...you will love your
husband the same way.

Look. This is his photo.

His father runs one of the biggest...

...ship building company in USA.

This is the best boy for you.

But papa, listen to me.

Papa, please.

Papa, I cannot live without Neel.
Papa, please papa.

I love Neel, papa.

I love Neel, papa.
Papa.

Sunny!

Sunny!

Sunny!

Tanvi, you.

What are you doing here?

Waiting for you.

Why are you after me?

What do you want?

You!

It's futile to talk to you.

Please wear your clothes
and come out.

How am I looking?

My shirt.

Take my shirt off?

What are you doing?

You had said, take the shirt off.

Tanvi, I had already told
you that I love Maya.

Whether you love Maya
or anyone else...

...but I love only you.

But I don't love you.

Then that's your mistake,
correct it.

You have gone completely mad.

Mad!

Mad!

A mad girl can do anything!

Oh my God! I can't even tell you!

You are laughing, dude!

I barely managed to escape
from my father and uncle!

Why does it always happen with you?

What do I tell you?

Did you give our progress
report to Jordan!

I am in touch with Jordon daily!

For the first time I can't
understand this girl.

Who?

Tanvi! I know she has
fixed up everything!

But I don't why I feel
something is fishy.

Believe me.

Who is it?

Think of the devil and
the devil appears.

Hello!
Yes!

I am sorry!
For what?

You know! And to apologise
for that...

...this evening I have
kept a party for you.

If you don't come, I will think
you have not forgiven me.

Okay. I will try.
Okay. Bye.

This is the new age mantra.

This is the new age mantra.

This is the new age mantra.

Om Namah Shivay.

Hail Radha Swami.

We spread the tantra of love
and peace all over the world.

This is the new age mantra.

This is the new age mantra.

This is the new age mantra.

This is the new age mantra.

Om Namah Shivay.

Hail Radha Swami.

What the heart says.

We do that.

Ask.

Why the whole world
is angry with us?

This is the new age mantra.

Don't stop us.

Don't taunt us.

Let us fly and touch our flight.

Dawn and dusk the
open sky calls us.

Om Namah Shivay.

Hail Radha Swami.

Om Namah Shivay.

Hail Radha Swami.

We are the new generation.

Age is new and hopes are new.

We are sober in this intoxication.

This is the new age mantra.

We will bring.

New vibrations.

New destinations and new paths.

Our steps are zestful.

Someday we will erase all
the signs of hatred.

Om Namah Shivay.

Hail Radha Swami.

Om Namah Shivay.

Hail Radha Swami.

Om Namah Shivay.

Hail Radha Swami.

We are finished, man!
We are totally ruined!

All this...

This...

How did all this happen?

I doubted her.

And I had told you too that
I can't understand this girl.

We are finished, Sunny.

My plight too was the
same as your plight.

When I came here, I thought
I had entered the wrong office.

Nothing was here!

Computer, cash, cheque book.

Credit cards information.

Even all the database of
the business was gone!

Her party was an excuse.

So that you will be in the party...

...and here she will
steal everything.

'The number you have dialled
is switched off.'

'Please try after some time.'

She fooled us.
'Thank you.'

Her cell phone is switched off too.

Let's call the police, man! Come on!

What police!

We will not leave her! Where
the hell could she be?

Good morning, ma'am.

Envelope please!
Sure!

Here you are!

Okay!

Maya Fernandez!

Yes!

Okay!

Hello!
Hello, Neel!

You lost my money and you
lost my trust, Neel!

But Jordon, it's Tanvi
who has done all this!

I don't care! You are fired, Neel!

Hello! Hello!

What happened?

Jordon thinks that I have
stolen the money!

Oh God!

I told you that something
is fishy, dude!

What has happened, Sunny?

In a moment a woman ruined us!

How can she ruin us?

If we don't make her plight worst,
then our life is useless!

What are you saying, brother?

You will make her plight bad when
you will get hold of her.

Shall I tell you something?

Rajesh has gone to USA!

And this Tanvi is with him!
It's their conspiracy!

We should go to USA. Yes,
we have to go!

But how? Somebody has
to stay here also!

Don't worry. Soy Chi
and I will stay here!

That's not a bad idea!

Everything went as per the plan.

But I had not thought
about my arrest.

I am confused, who told you this?

Mr. Rajesh!

If he had not helped
us... then maybe...

...we couldn't have arrested you.

Thank you so much. Thank you.

No, Neel. Thank your friend Sunny.

Sunny?

Yes! If Sunny had not come to me...

...and if he had not
reminded me my duty...

...then maybe I could
have never done this.

Where is Sunny?

He has gone to the bank
with the FBI officer...

...where Tanvi has deposited
the fraud money.

Rajesh, you didn't
do the right thing.

Shut up, Tanvi!

For a trivial matter, you
ruined Neel's career!

You think a beautiful girl's
insult is a trivial matter?

You are a mad, crazy girl!

Yes!

Okay!

Mr. Neel!
Yes, sir!

Good news for you!

85% of your money
has been recovered.

And it will be given to you after
the formalities are over.

Mr. Neel, you may go now.
Thank you, officer!

Thank you once again, Rajesh!

You are welcome.

Thank you!
Take care!

Okay, Ms. Tanvi! Let's go!

Ladies and Gentlemen!

I take the honour to announce
the engagement...

...of my lovely daughter Maya
to dashing Michael Pereira!

Son of shipping magnet
Mr. Albert Pereira!

Lovely!

What are you doing, sir?

Due to the high tide...

...the starfish gets washed
away on the shore.

Some are washed back into the water.

And some are left here... to die.

What difference will it make?

There are so many starfishes
here. Nobody cares.

It made a difference to that one!

Neel! Do you see the starfishes?

The way it can't live
without water...

...the same way you can't
live without Maya.

Before it's too late, Neel,
give her a call.

Do the right thing. Give
her a call. Go, meet her.

Knock once more.

Yes!

Hey, man! I didn't order
any pizza. What's up?

Actually we wanted to
find out about Maya.

The girl who stays here.

Hey, man. I have been
here for 4 months.

No girl lives here. Except
for on Friday nights.

Got my drift?

What?

Oh!

He is an Indian. Let's ask him.

Indian!

Sir, greetings.
Greetings!

Do you live here?
Tell me.

Sir, a family used to live
in your neighbourhood.

A beautiful girl called Maya.

Maya!
Yes, Maya!

Do you know where she has gone?

I don't know where she has gone.

But she was very sad while leaving.

She was really upset.
Thank you.

I am telling you, brother. Maya
didn't leave willingly.

Her father forcefully took
her with him. Note it down.

Mr. Kumar, do you know Mr. Neel?

Kumar sir!

I know him very well.

He was framed in a fraud case.
Now he is acquitted.

Would you like to say something?

Whether the time is good
or bad... a gem is a gem.

But when time is bad
many people think...

...that gem is a piece of glass.

But you know, I always knew
that Neel is a diamond.

A very priceless diamond.
One in a million.

I am sorry, Neel! I am so sorry!

What the hell! Didn't I trust you?

Neel!

Neel! I am not Neel! I am Steve!

But I can be whoever you
want me to be, baby!

Shut up!

I need to find you, Neel.
I need to find you.

Papa!
Yes.

Papa, I want to go to New York.

New York? What for?

Dear, you can go after the wedding.
It's only a few days.

Papa! It's the girls
stuff, you know.

I need to buy a few personal things.

I see! I see! Look, dear.
Be back on time.

Yes, papa!

Love you!
Thanks, papa!

Neel!

Neel!

Come on, Neel! Let's think!

How can we get in touch with her?

I had not thought.

I had not known.

Such a moment would come.

I will get loneliness in love.

My beloved will part from me.

I will lose all the joys.

I will cry in loneliness.

Smilingly. Smilingly.

Smilingly. Smilingly.

Smilingly. Smilingly.

Smilingly. Smilingly.

Smilingly. Smilingly.

Smilingly. Smilingly.

Smilingly. Smilingly.

Smilingly. Smilingly.

Hi, Nick!
Hi!

Have you got any news on Neel?

Sorry! Haven't seen him in ages!

I am not sure what to tell you.
Is everything okay?

Yes. Everything is okay!

Hi!

Good morning, sir!

Today I am going to talk
about something...

...that is very important
in our lives.

Something we all cherish.

And that is the relationships
in our lives.

We all want to enjoy
great relationships...

...with people who are
near and dear to us.

Relationships are made in heaven.

But they have to be maintained
here on earth.

Every morning you should
make the decision...

...to stay in love with the
one you fell in love with.

You should always be thinking...

...what can I do today to make
this relationship better.

Men! Don't wait for her
to make you happy!

Do the things that make her happy!

Ladies! You don't love him
because you need him!

You need him because you love him!

Love is unconditional!

Love is like a question.'

'Love has eyes and
love has eyelids.'

Hello! Hello, Neel!
Hello!

Sunny here!
Hi, Sunny!

Neel! Neel!
Hang on!

Listen! Listen! Listen!

Yes, Sunny! Tell me! Tell me!

Are you friend of Neel? I said yes!

He told me Maya has been
looking for you!

What!

Maya has been looking for you!

I am coming! I am coming!
I am coming! I am leaving!

I am coming! I am coming!

Thank you!

Kumar sir! Kumar sir!

Kumar sir! Kumar sir!

Kumar sir!

Kumar sir!

Kumar sir!

Neel!

Neel! Neel! Neel!

I am coming Neel!

Maya! Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

Come, come, come, come, come.

Do you like pushing me down?

Yes, you look so cute
when you fall Mr. Pro.

You still here.

I will have her call again,
when she comes here.

It's alright.

I will wait.

'Oh God, please help
me in finding Neel.'

'Amen.'

Hello.

Hi dad.

All the guests have started
coming for the marriage...

...and they are all asking for you.

When are you coming?

Yes, actually the dress alteration
took a little time.

But you don't worry,
I will be there on time.

'Ok, dear. Bye.'

Maya.
What?

Maya.
What happened?

God does some strange things.

God does some strange things.

My sweetheart should never
separate from me.

My sweetheart should never
separate from me.

God does some strange things.

Without my darling,
without my darling.

I will die without my darling.

Without my darling,
without my darling.

I will die without my darling.

Without my darling,
without my darling.

I will die without my darling.

Without my darling,
without my darling.

I will die without my darling.

My desires say to me.

Bring my beloved in front of me.

That's a request.

Spare me my life or kill me.

My shattered dreams are
scattered everywhere.

I wandered everywhere,
in search of my beloved.

Listen, listen to my heartbeats.

My sweetheart should never
separate from me.

Without my darling,
without my darling.

I will die without my darling.

Without my darling,
without my darling.

I will die without my darling.

Smilingly! Smilingly!

Neel!

Neel!
Smilingly! Smilingly!

Smilingly! Smilingly!

Neel!
Smilingly! Smilingly!

Excuse me.

Smilingly! Smilingly!

Neel!

Smilingly! Smilingly!

Neel!

I have not seen him
around the campus.

But I can check to find out
when he last logged in.

Anything sir.

Any information that you
give me about Neel...

...that will be great.

Well Maya, it seems like
he has not logged in...

...since he left for India.

But does it show his address
or anything sir?

I am not supposed to give that out.

But I can tell you that,
his address is the same...

...as when he went to school.

Thank you sir.

By the way.

You heard of him getting cleared
of all those charges...

...right.
Yes. I saw the news.

Good.

Poor kid, he really
went through a lot.

He is a fighter.

A real fighter.

I think I have lost everything
after going to India.

Tell me one thing, did she
tell you her address...

...or the address of any of her
relative during the meeting.

Remember.

Try to remember.

You mean Maya's wedding.

She has gone for her
grand-daughter's marriage.

Hello.
Hi Sunny.

Where are you, brother?

I am waiting for you dude.

Sunny, Maya is getting married.

What?

Where?

I don't know that.

Oh my God.

Neel.

If Maya is getting married...

...then she will surely
invite the principal.

Good morning, sir. Sir, actually...

...the thing is that I wanted
to find out about Maya.

You won't believe this,
but Maya was here.

I haven't seen her looking
so... unlike Maya.

I haven't seen her not smiling.

But sir...
Sir, did she leave anything, mobile number.

So we can call her.
No.

She didn't.

Thank you so much
for your time, sir. Thank you.

Thank you sir, thank you very much.

Wait.

I think I have something
that could help.

My assistant received
Maya's wedding card...

...about 2 weeks ago.

Oh my God!

Today!

Hey brother, you know this
church is very far away.

How will you reach there?

I will reach there.

This is a 4 hour journey,
and you say...

...you want to reach
for the marriage.

I will reach there, don't worry.

Fine, go ahead.

How will you reach in such traffic?

I am going Sunny.

Every moment, every place

I think only about her.

I know,

she can't live without me.

Her memories stalk me everywhere.

This loneliness haunts
me every minute.

I am helpless, time is against me.

God does some strange things.

God does some strange things.

My sweetheart should never
separate from me.

Without my darling,
without my darling.

I will die without my darling.

O Lord, O Lord.

I will die, O Lord.

Excuse me.

Yes.

Is the wedding over?

Yes, it's over, son.

You must be late or something.

Something like that.

Don't worry son.

You will get your present back.

Excuse me.

The truth is the wedding
never even began.

The bride called it
off this morning.

Called it off.
Yes.

Any idea where she could have gone?

No, sorry.

Thank you.

I am sorry.

I know I am stupid.

I am sorry.

I know I am stupid.

I love you.

Whether you receive joy
or sorrow in love.

Keep walking on this path.

Whether you receive joy
or sorrow in love.

In my eyes and my thoughts...

...would dwell love.

Whatever be the objective,
whatever be the ambiance.

We should always be together.

May we always love each other.

May we carry on loving each other.

Laughing-laughing.

Laughing-laughing.

Laughing-laughing.

Laughing-laughing.

you are the only
one spoken and debated about.

I am not aware
whether its night or day.

I'm in your arms
and you are in mine.

I am not worried
about anything now.

I am not worried
about anyone now.

Or life will pass by this way.

Laughing-laughing.
