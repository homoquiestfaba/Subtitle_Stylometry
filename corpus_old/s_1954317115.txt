<i>Now we can tell this, comes back it,
had the pot PCP or some other shit</i>

so even though they're six
nobody wants to go near the guy!

So Charlie is the first
to paralyze taser.

He tases the son of a bitch
who starts twitching go, go, go.

<i>We laugh.
This guy</i>

ag, ag, ag

So then Pete and Danny
they put at paralyzer taser too.

-Excuse me.
-By the time we're done

we've all got the taser aligned
the guy still don't go down.

He just stand there going to...

I hate to interrupt this fun memories.

but can one of you,
possibly, help me?

Well, that depends, young lady,
just what kind of help you need.

I'm here to report
a missing person.

-And who are you?
-My name is Larissa Morgan and

I'm looking for my younger sister.
We live together.

-How long has your sister been missing?
-She is been going for nearly three days now.

-You do have a fight?

No. Nothing like that.

She went at jogging two nights ago
before dinner and never came back.

Her name is Annie.
This is a picture.

Nice tits.

That's all you can say?

A young girl had gone missing,
who knows what might happen to her...

and the only thing you can do
is making some sexist crack...?

Please, calm down, miss.
The Inspector is only trying ...

I know what he is trying say
and I do not appreciate it.

You stick up for each other, don't you?

Now, what exactly are you going
to do about finding my sister?

So where your sister allegedly go missing?

She left our apartment in Lincoln Heights
at aproximately  6:00 p.m. on tuesday.

Was the last I've seen ever.

Well. I want you to be sure and
include all that when you fill up this forms.

And leave it on the desk out.

Nice ass.

Inspector, do you think
this could be related to the others?

-Miss Morgan, wait up.
-What happens. I forgot my e-mail address?

No

I just want to apologize
for the way inspector treating on her.

Sometimes he can be rude.

Rude, insensitive, asshole?

Yeah. You can say that.
Unfortunately, it also happens to be my boss.

Well. I'm sorry to hear that.  But I have
problems of my own, or you don't pay attention?

I wise. I mean see that's
what I want to talk to you about

Is it has been other
disappearances in your area.

Disappearances?

All the other girls were residents there.

The Mary Magdalene Halfway House
for Troubled Girls.

Every month or so they report
another one missing.

Can they just run away? I mean the place
doesn't exactly look like club med

This is that the Inspector thinks.

Nice weather has meant
anything in the media about it.

-But you think something different?
-I didn't..

Until I heard
of your sister, Miss Morgan.

-Call me Larissa. And you are?
-Sergeant Sheen. Dick Sheen.

And I suppose you
like to keep your weapon nice and clean.

-I beg your pardon?
-Skip it.

Why right discovering
and find out what they know.

Hold down. You just can't walk over there
and start asking questions.

And why not?

The people who run that place
aren't just going to volunteer information

to somebody who comes in
off the streets

They bunch of close to religious types

-But I am her sister.
-Yeah, I am a cop.

Is my job to do the investigation.

That's not what your boss thinks.

Oh. And...?

He is an asshole.

Good morning, Sister.

Yes

Good afternoon ma'am... sister.

I am sergeant Sheen
Lincoln Heights Division.

Is Father Fogerty?

Yes, but he is hearing
the girls confessions.

-That can take hours.
-I see.  I hope that you tell me something, sister

Sister Cecilia.

Have you adding more
girls run away, disappeared?

Heavens no. We would have
report it if they have.

And any of the other girls,
have ever come around again?

No, not yet. We're living in constant hope
that the poor lost souls will be return to us.

I'm sure you do. By the chance,
have you seen this girl.

She is not one of ours.
I'd surely remember her... face.

-Who is this child?
-Her name is Annie. She is from the area.

She's been reported missing too.

Oh. I see. Well.
I'll be sure we pray for her safe return.

And I'll be happy to show this
to father Fogerty, if you like.

No. I guess that won't be necessary.

After all if she had come right here
probably you would know.

Yes. There isn't much to get finally here.

Well. Good day, sergeant.

If they do know anything
I'm sure are not going to volunteer it.

But...

Is more easy in there.

But you mentioned in your report

that your sister wore in
these yellow and black radio headphones?

Yeah. She had them on the last
time I saw her.

She wore everywhere.

Well. There is this guy there,
handyman, janitor, something.

Flippy type.

And...?

It may not mean nothing, but
he is wearing the same type of headphones.

Dick, we've got to go back.
It does have to be hers.

Wait a minute. Not so fast.

Don't you see? That is too much
of a coincidence.

Those people could have done
something to Annie

I can't go in there and poke around
without a search warrant.

-Get one.
-Ha, ha. Up but this time with evidence

And I'll have my badge for.

What are you gonna do that?

I'll talk to the Inspector.
He'll listen me.

Are you out of your fucking mind?

Are you ever
expecting to get promoted

to keep going off half-cocked
on these wild ass hunches.

You're not been professional.

You should know better in the
let some hysterical broad

lead you around
and make up a full "I love you"

Stop thinking with your dick, Dick

But what about the headphones?

Circumstantial bullshit, that's what.

You are telling me that young women
under protective care

of the Mary Magdalene Halfway House
are being abducted

and possibly harmed in some way

and the representatives of the
Catholic Church

are somehow trying to cover it up.

Now. Who wind up?
Hell, who is gonna believe that?

Now get out of my office
before I have you suspended

for being such a moron.

I suppose I'm on my own now.

I'm really sorry. I feel like a ???.

At least you tried it.
Is more than anyone else has done.

Yeah, but I just wish there was
some way to make it up to you.

Nice of you to invite me.

Yeah, I needed company.

You'll miss much your sister.
What a fool I am.

We lived in our house since
that our mother died.

I'm in my dad's room somewhere,
he is ??? work for us.

Just gotta find her.
you gotta help me.

I want it, but how?

We can get inside this place.

You can take me in a girl troubled.

No way.
It's too risky.

It's the only way.

Once I'm inside
under cover a final is going on.

And what if I know what you want to...

Down a level? This keep me help.

And if he is okay?
No, I can't you do it

-Oh yes. You will.
-No, I will not.

-Take it please ...
NO. No way.

I'm gonna do it with or without
your help.

So. Yes or no?
Yes ...

or no.

All right. I'll help you do it.

Thanks.

Hello again, sergeant.
What brings you back here?

Official business, sister.
This young lady is in trouble.

-Oh, really. What kind of trouble?
-The same old story I'm afraid.

Miles from home, in a strange city,
no money, no friends.

We picture for panhandling
outside a bus station.

That's no really a crime,
but it's only a matter of time ...

before she's on the drugs,
prostitution, armed robbery

Police says, sister,
is this a life worth saving?

Of course. We'll take good care for..

Larissa.

Well Larissa.
Step this way

Thank you, sister. I'll come back
in a couple of days and make sure she's OK.

For really that won't be necessary.
Everything will be just fine.

Like this. I'll show the office around.

And what is your last name?

Morgan.
Larissa Morgan.

Well Miss Morgan.

I'm sure you'll find a better life here
than you did in the streets.

I'm sure well.

Good, because if you screw up
here, you'll wish never ???.

<i>Yeah.</i>

It's Sister Cecilia.

<i>What?</i>

Yes. We have a new guest.

<i>Come in.</i>

Ah.

Father.

Welcome.
A jelly bean?

No.

Well. This halfway house was named
after Saint Mary Magdalene...

an adulteress who converted
by completely dedicated herself to Christ

-Just how do I do that?
-Trust and faith, my dear.

And in return we will take care
of all your needs.

The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want...

Yes, my dear. That's is exactly.
This is one place in the world

where you can always be safe.

Thank you, father.

Now report back to sister Cecilia
and she'll show you around

Oh, and, God be with you, my child.

This is the rec room. That's where you'll
be spending the most of your time.

When you will not be in church
or in the classroom or

doing chores.

So, I'll leave you to introduce yourself
and make new friends.

Who the fuck are you?

Who the fuck wants to know?

I was happy to be the number
one bitch around here.

I can see that.

You got a smart mouth.
Maybe I'd shut it for you.

-You and your army
-Me and my homegirls.

How would you like us
to rearrange your face?

-Uou, welcoming the new girl I see.
-What itch to you?

I see when you start playing
rugby you have a nasty fall.

After all Angelina, you could slip
on this hour born and crack your scope.

Wide open.

-Wide open you...
-Shut up

Have your way for now.
Just be careful bending over in shower.

Yeah, why is that?

'Cause you never know when a little
dutch boy might come along in shadows. Dyke!

Thanks for stopping in like that, but
I probably could have handled it.

You look like you make it only

Angelina fights dirty and besides
she's always got Shelby and Sheila  with her.

-What's your name?
Em... Larissa. And you are?

My friends call me Cherry-pie.
I do hope we can be friends.

You know you'd be watching
your ass around here.

It may be not be anyone
around to save you the next time.

I see you later.

Make sure you do a thorough job ladies
and lunch is in a half an hour.

And remember, cleanliness is
next to godliness.

What dirty old.

Don't ??? you know
is going onto yet.

-Are you going to ???, Father Fogerty?
Not today. May your way is for to do.

What...?

Bed time, ladies!

Come on! Everybody
at your room!

Let's go.

-Goodnight, Sister Cecilia.
-Goodnight.

-Goodnight Sister.
-Goodnight.

Goodnight.

Goodnight. Don't forget
to say your prayers.

Just a minute.

Come in.

It's me. I just wanted
to say goodnight.

Goodnight.

Don't forget to turn your light out.
Sister Cecilia comes around in checks it.

??? the windows are the inside.

Don't have much privacy
around here, is there?

Not much, no.
Goodnight.

<i>Hello.</i>

It's me.

Are you alright?

<i>Yeah, I guess that could say that.</i>

This place has all the warmth
of a concentration camp.

I told you it was not
good idea.

But our intention was to find out
what happened to Annie.

Well, ???, can you check on this
father Fogerty character?

Do you suspect him?

Well. Can say that is twisted enough to vote
the marquee the share deciding saintness

That does not prove anything.

Find away  out about him or the
rest of the staff.

Okay. But if things get too strange,
just give me a call.

I can more than ???

Like a knight in shining armor?

Ah?

<i>Nevermind. Wait for me I call you</i>

??? into the ??? stop I'm not allowed
contact with the outside wolrd.

<i>Do you understand?</i>

Right you then.

Goodnight.

Well kid, this is it.

Again? But you're finished.

No. I meet a nice night ???
with ??? a stop.

-You are serious.
-Serious as a heart attack, baby.

And you're coming with me.

I don't know about this.
What if we get caught?

Is it worth the risk to get away from
Attila the nine in that proverbial priest?

??? handyman that trying to watch
when we're in the showers?

Him too. That's why we gotta get away.

Me ???. ???

-I know you well, but ...
-But what? Come and help me with this.

Now. Are we going do it climbs down,
make it to the streets.

There were home free.

You go first.

I can't. I feel afraid of heights.

Oh. Okay, I'll go first.

It's make sure the knot not slip.

-Then what?
-Then you climb down after me.

I'll be there to catch you if you fall.

-I don't know.
-Oh. Come on.

Who's my sweet baby bitch?

-I am.
-That's right.

Now quit stalling and hang on.

What's the fuck!

Oh, shit!

No!

What the fucking are you doing?

Let me go, you pervert!

That's the fuck called the kettle black.

Your deviant desires can
hardly be considered. No more.

Sister Cecilia? What are you doing here?
What are you dressing like that?

We all have little secrets.

Look. I was trying to run away and
you catch me.  Alright?

I'll take whatever punishment
he has in store for me.

Oh, you're going to be punished.
You are right.

Like this!

Oh! Oh! Oh, my God!

Oh! Oh, my God!

Oh!!! Oh, my God!!!

Your God wont save you now.

This sort of behavior
is entirely unacceptable.

I would like anyone who has
any information to

please, step forward, now.

I said ... anyone ...

Ah! Very well.

All privileges are suspended

and... there will be no dessert tonight.

Miss ???-pie, may I see you
in my office, please.

Now.

How many get that little ??? for this?

After is anything left over
after Father Fogerty ??? with her.

Oh. That'is just a warmup
for what I have ??? in mind.

I'm sure she knows
more than she is telling.

??? she does or doesn't.

the girls till dawn.

-Yes I know.
-Are you calling the police again?

We must report it,
just as we have all the others.

What ??? to?
They can't find any of them.

That's not the point.

-What is the point then?
-This grows our responsibility.

We have a duty to do.

Everything we can.

Shit!

Another one? When?

Well, give me the name
and a description.

Aha.

Oh. But will look into it.
You're welcome.

Sheen is still out there.

<i>Yes, is there.</i>

Send the man here.

Do you send me?

You remember that girl from the other day,
the one who's looking for her sister?

-You mean at Miss Morgan.
-You are senior ???

Why not? What would like?

You too think ??? to me.

Yeah. She did come to me
looking into the halfway house

but you cue its entire suspicions
were unfounded.

or something to that effect.

I did say that, didn't I?

Some pretty crazy stuff
so after all.

Yes, sir.

-??? that be all?
-Yeah. That's for now.

???

???

Jesus!
What did he do to you?

Asks me some questions, that's all.

-What it happened to Eddie?
-She's gone.

What really happened
to Eddie?

She's gone. She's gone like the others.
That's all I know.

Did you find anything out about
the missing girls?

No yet. That's can our here father.

I told you everything I know
on the phone.

Another girl disappears from here.

So that makes six girls so far.

<i>Five.</i>

What?

There are only five girls missing.
You said six.

<i>I must be thinking about
that other girl</i>

<i>I'm sorry. I'm afraid not.</i>

Really. And what about the others,
you know,  the ones from here?

Do you think that anybody from here
knows anything about them?

Well. Naturally we question the girls
every single time,

but they always insist that
they know nothing.

And you believe it?

What else can we do?
I mean...

After all who knows
what goes in the minds of young girls...

especially in the troubled ones?

If it's all the same to you, Padre,
I'm just gonna a look around the grounds.

You mean research the
premises?

Oh, nothing formal.
Do you understand?

And... I promise not to get
in the way of other

all good work you're doing
around here.

Oh. I trust you won't.

Do it inspector,
and God will be with you.

Hello?

Hello?

What?
What the hell?

Goodbye, inspector.

¿Hello?

Larissa, there is it me.

Dick, I told you not to call me here.
You can get me past it.

I had to. I think something's
happened

<i>to inspector Hinds.</i>

That asshole?
Why should I care about him?

Listen. I found some noted fix.

Apparently notes the girls been reported missing
from the halfway house.

I know.

You do? What happened?

I don't know. She just disappeared.

Now we want to talk about anything

<i>around here.</i>

Well. I think the Inspector were there
to investigate.

<i>Have you seen him?</i>

No.

<i>??? investigate this morning</i>

???  call them. This is unlike.

What you find out about the rest of staff?

I did some checking into Father Fogerty.
So far is clean.

<i>That's my own opinion.</i>

What about Sister Cecilia
and the handyman?

After all with him use wearing

<i>my sisters headphones.</i>

I'm working on it.

Remember, I'm doing all this
unofficially.

I gotta go. And wait for me
to call you next time.

What's the matter?

Not so cocky without that big dike
to protect you.

-What do you want from me?
-We wanna get even with you.

So, what?

We lost our privileges.

Yeah. And the desserts.

-Bu... But why is that my fault?
Listen to little Miss Inocence.

-Where's your last girlfriend gone?
-???

If you insist. Hold her down!

Oh! She's not in there.
Where else could you be hiding here?

Well, well, well.
I know why they call her Cherry.

-Is there  ???.
-She doesn't know what she's missing.

Hey. Why don't we show her.

That's a good idea. Hold her tighter.
This cherry is a bad to get bad.

Look what I found!

Wow. Economy size.

Hey Cherry. Would you like a date
with Madonna!

Madonna! The singer?
You know her?

Not that Madonna, stupid!

Open wide, she comes ...

That's no way
to treat a virgin.

-What the fuck are you here?
-Yeah, this is not your bussiness.

Maybe it should make
my bussiness.

No! The bitch is mine.
Watch the door.

I'd like to taste
your blood.

Maybe you can tell me
when you're done.

Come on! Come on!

Hit the ??? Angelina.
Hit the ???.

Quiet. Father Fogerty is coming.

Okay, he's gone.

He's coming back.

Okey. It's clear.

They... They... They tried ...

It's okey. It's okey.
I'm being right now.

You saved to me.

I do not know how
I repay you.

What are you doing?

All these,
these must've been mixed up in my lock.

I wanna hear it.

It's after dark. Time
to get rid of that detective corp.

Yes, Mistress.

I want you to take it
as far away as possible.  Understand?

Good.

Will you keep it down?

What's the matter, Angelina?
You got a headache?

No, she is ???.

Cause you got a asked it.

Yeah, I guess is not that
instead she thought she was.

I can't still look forward
but the two of you.

Yeah, you're right.

Should get out here.

But you go wrong back.

You promised to take me away
from this fucking shithole.

-You has gas money?
-No.

Alright then. Parking back.

-Sexy.

That's it. Don't... Don't...
Ah... Ah... Ah...

Don't stop it!

-I'm not stopping.
-Don't! Don't!

Well. I knew you'd end up here
sooner or later.

You people are fucking in sick!

-Ah, ah. Language dear.
-That beast cut off his head!

Oh. Your late friend? His head was in serving
any purpose where was.

Now you too have
a glorious future in store.

What do you fucking talking about?

You will be food for our God.

Your flesh will provide sustenance
for a being fastly superior to you.

Yes! It's an honor that
you die for it. Go.

If there any more runaways
will have to put him on a diet.

I called you all here today
to pray ...

for our missing daughters.

Two runaways
in two days?

That makes...
one a day!

At this rate will be empty
in a couple of weeks!

No. I can not believe that ??? one of
you do not know something about all of this!

First Edwin disappears.

Then Angelina runs off the following
night to join her.

What the fuck hated each other!

Excuse me?

-Nothing Father.
-Oh no, no, no. Apart from the profanity...

I distinctly heard you say
something about the missing girls.

All she meant was...

Yes.

Angelina and Edwin didn't get a loan.
That's all.

They never would run away together.

Really? Well!  It seems that you two
know a great deal about all of this.

You two ...  My office,
now. Carrie on, Sister.

Everyone, please rise
and ??? sing. Holly, holly, holly...

Oh Lord, we humbly beseech thee
to show these sinners...

the truth is the only
way to redemption.

Now! Repeat after me.

The power of Christ
compels me.

The power of Christ
compels me.

Now you.

The power of Christ
compels me.

The power of Christ
compels me.

The power of Christ
compels me.

Both together.

The power of Christ
compels me.

The power of Christ
compels me.

The power of Christ
compels me.

The power of Christ
compels me.

The power of Christ
compels me.

<i> Yes, I know about the other
desappearance. We have a call this morning.</i>

<i>Have you find out anything?</i>

No. Nothing yet.
How of you?

<i>I came up with a ???
interesting stuff </i>

<i>about Sister Cecilia and
her creepy friend.</i>

<i>??? there just for an hour?</i>

-What day is this?
-Wednesday. Why?

I can't be gone for long.
What did you find?

All things are Sister Cecilia has led
a pretty typical life for a nun ...

until about 3 years ago.

-What happened then?
-She was teaching in an all-boys school

when she was gang-raped
for some of her students.

13 about.

-Unlucky.
-It gets better.

Genuine psychiatric testing was ordered
to take a leave of absence.

She went on a training at Massachusetts
spending a lot of her time

on  a library Misketonik University.

Misketonik. Why that sound
familiar?

I don't know. But who
was working there at the same time?

The handyman.

That's right. When Charles Dexter ???
his working like a janitor.

That's great, but still doesn't explain why.

On this one other thing.
Shortly before they left Massachusetts

a rare book was stolen
from the University Library.

-A book. So what?
-This book is called the Necronomicon.

It was believed to contain
mystical spells of power.

The professors there say that only
are one copy in existence.

I see you think Sister Cecilia
is practicing black magic.

What next? Human sacrifices?

-I know it's a wacky idea but...
-Wich sure explains a lot.

I gotta go back.

Wait a minute. If it's all true
you can be in serious danger.

I gotta go back.
Cherry might me mind.

Who?

Nevermind. Find out what you can
about "Necro watch me call it"

may that give us a few more answers.

-But...
-I'll call you in a couple hours.

Okey.

Where were you?
Answer me. Where were you?

-I was in the yard.
-You were outside alright.

You were outside the grounds.

But I wasn't.

Don't make it worse on yourself
by lying.

And what pray tell was this
doing in your room.

I was afraid I was going to have to report
another missing call to the police!

I didn't run away.
I just snuck out for a while.

That still doesn't tell me
where you went.

I don't wanna say.

Probably ran off
to meet up with some boy ...

That's not true.

to engage in sinful carnal pleasures.

-Father, you've got it all wrong.
-Silence!

It doesn't matter why you left the grounds.

The fact that you did it is a serious infraction
and must therefore be punished.

Wait, please.
You've gotta listen to me.

Something terrible
is going on around here

and Sister Cecilia is at the ???.

Sister Cecilia!

Yes. I know it seems hard
to understand but...

she's not ???
She is very ??? (too stir).

It's more can really.

Yes. It's true. Her
and her handyman ...

are practicing things against
God and the Catholic Church.

I see. So now the handyman is
involved in this as well.

Yes Father. It's true
and you gotta do something about it.

Oh. I intend to.

Now, kinda leaning against the desk
and repeat after me.

-Larissa.
-Cherry, gotta help me.

What happened you?

I just 110 rounds of father fuck end
is wholly ??? this ???.

Sit down.

I don't think be
sitting for a while.

Listen Cherry...
I gotta tell you something.

-I'm not like the others girls here.
-I know you're not.

No. I do not mean that.
I'm here undercover.

You're some kind of cop?

No. No. But I'm working with one.

In trying to find out what
happened to my sister.

I think there's a connection
between her disappearance

and those what happen here.

You mean my ???

I thought she just ran away.

I think that Sister Cecilia and handyman
have something to do with all this.

-Can I do the help?
-I need to search her room.

And I want you stand watch.
I don't want they catch at the end.

-Pretty smooth you picked up lock.
-Just one of my many talents.

Save it for later.

Okey.

It's gone.

What is?

There used to be a cross in here.
I wonder when she ???.

Open awful in
the head of ??? bitch.

??? looking that way.

Jesus Christ.

<i>Hello. Larissa?</i>

<i>It's me. I found much more
stuff about the Necronomicon book.</i>

<i>Hello. Are you there?</i>

<i>Larissa. What is coming out?</i>

Hello.
Hello!

This is it.

-Somebody is coming.
-Who is it?

It is...
Sister Cecilia!

I'm sorry I'm not a good look out.
I'll try it better next time.

There won't be a next time.

Hand over that book,
Miss Morgan.

Hand it over, please.

Look. I don't know what you're doing with it,
but I'm not the only one who knows about it.

Oh, yes. Your friend, the young sergeant.
I expect that he'll be here looking for you.

It's a pity that
he's never gonna to find.

Larissa!

-There will be two tonight?
-No. Not this one.

She must be found far away from here
and must look like an accident.

I don't want to raise
any more suspicions.

-What will you do with me?
-You, my dear?

I'm going to invite you to the dinner.

Do you me?
What are we having?

It won't be long now. As soon as
Lutkus stays care for your friend.

It will be up your turn.

Sister Cecilia.
You look different.

Oh. I hope this idiot
doesn't take all night.

What?

-Are you okay?
-I'm living.

You were right about the Sister
Cecilia and book.

Shit!

College my research the Necronomicon
holds the secrets to bring back the Old Ones.

The Old Ones?

There is a race of monsters ???.

And was ruled the planet
before men.

Supposedly they chat in
other dimension now

By performing rituals that are described
in that book.

A gate will be open and
he'll be able to reenter our world.

What happen us?

We'll be destroyed.

We must stop them.

-Where is she now?
-I don't know.

But I know someone who does.

Where is Sister Cecilia?

??? I tell you.

I don't know.

Okey.

-Down here.
-That's biggest.

My shoelaces untied.

I can't believe that ???
should it ???.

All this time ...

I was trying to protect you
not to get hurt.

I'll call for help.

It isn't time for that.

You could stop ...

I'm sorry...

Get away from her, you bitch!

Larissa. You came for me!

What the fuck can ???
is going on here?

Since you're so persistent
I believe I'll tell you.

Beyond that door,
life the ??? god of a new age ...

An age where man will be replace
as dominant species of the planet.

Why the hell would you want to
do that?

Because man is
a ??? vulgar creature

ruled by his own lust. He is not fit
to even touch the sanctity that is a woman.

I put myself above such
animal passions.

But that wasn't enough.

I was raped, defiled by the very impure creatures
that the church told me to love.

But then I found a truer,
older faith.

A believe that the permanent
humanity could be purged

by a superior race.

Well, I heard that before. And just,
how are you going to accomplish all this?

I unrevealed the secrets
of the Necronomicon ...

and I have brought forth a being that
will father a new world

and I will be its mother.

You mean you plan on fucking
some monster from beyond

and having its children?

You're lot sicker
than I thought.

I have committed my body
to the future ruler of the planet.

And what about my sister? And the others?
What happened to them?

Nourishment. He needed to eat
to build his strength ...

to bridge the gap
between his world than ours.

Even the future ruler of the planet
needs to eat.

I've heard enough of this ???!

Sister Cecilia, I am then shocked
with what I've seen here.

First, by finding you allowed these girls
to leave the rooms after lights shut.

Second, I have heard your spanding believes
contrary the Holy Mother Church.

And third, you're out your uniform!

I could not expect your puny mind
to grass much less embrace your future.

Enough for me! I cast you out!

What in name of God
is that?

Oh that. That's your destiny ...

Your and all the other pet bedding
doomed members of your race.

In nomini Patris et Filii et Spiritus...

Well done. That's finished.

You're not ???

Yeah, I can and I will.

You think your religion
is any better?

Sure. But your neighbors ???
you too.

Condemns the Church because
these guys ???

The Church near I have to demand again.
I've got my plan on eliminating them.

You must
go through me first.

No! No! I'm your wife!

Look that
???.

Stop! Stop!

-Let's go out here.
-No, not yet. I gonna finish it.

???
Son of bitch!

You did it!
You saved me again.

Let's get hell out of here.
