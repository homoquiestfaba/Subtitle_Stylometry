Mina and Elijah.

Come on guys, the sun is
almost down, Daddy's serious.

Daddy, daddy.

I got you.
You found us.

Hey, did you guys
hear me calling you?

We're just playing.

Nuhyou made us run away.
No, I didn't. -Elijah, come on, bud.

Elijah!

All right, come here, bud.

Come on, okay.

Now, look, I know you're upset, okay,
but we talked about this, right?

It's a little like football.

I'm the team captain.

We've all been training really
hard, now, it's just time, okay?

It's time for us to go
play in the big game.

But you've never
been to war before.

Well, it's not
really a war, buddy.

I'm just going over there
to go help some people.

That's it.

Then you don't have to go.

Soldiers only go to wars.

Sometimes, they
go for peace, too.

And those guys in my
platoon, those are my guys.

You understand?

They're my family, too, and daddy's got
to go over there and keep them safe.

You like them better than us.
Hey, Elijah, no. -I hope you never come back.

Hey, come on bud,
Elijah, hey, get back, hey.

Let him go, let him go,
let him get it out.

Talk to him in the morning.

It's okay, he'll be
okay, he'll be fine.

Yeah, yeah.

These two wanted to say goodbye.

Your humble Knights, ma'am.

God.

Come on, you take
care out there.

We'll watch out
for him, don't worry.

Yeah.

You guys got enough DVDs
to pass the time out there?

This man will insist all
four seasons of<i> The Sopranos.</i>

Dude, it's TV history.

Stay safe out there, Tomas.

I will.

You better.

Battalion mount up, all
units board to transport.

I got to go.

Come on, Lupe, I
got other people to hug too.

Mom, what?

I won't see you for a year,
mijo, I just wanna remember.

I love you, little brother.

I love you, Tracie.
Bye, mijo.

I'm gonna miss you so much.
Yeah.

You'll be back
before we know it.

Mind your weapon, Guzman.

Sorry, Sergeant B.

Any news on our duty
assignment yet, sir?

No, not yet.

It'll be one of the Four R's
though, Rebuild, Restore.

Reuse, Recycle?
That's right.

How does a man do that,
sleep in this?

Chen.

Chen could sleep through
a nuclear explosion, sir.

<i>1st Cavalry, starting
our decent.</i>

Next stop, the great unknown.

How are you feeling?

Good.
Yeah? -You, sir?

I feel ready.

What, what should I do, sir?

Just tap the horn and put
some muscle into it, Riddell.

They'll move, man.

You got to let go of this polite Oregon
hippie driving, man, this is the Middle East.

So we get to the meet, and in walks in this,
this huge dude with like a foot long beard.

He look like, like
Hagrid from<i> Harry Potter.</i>

And the Iraqis are like, Lieutenant,
this is our Chief of Security,

so Hagrid comes up to me and he's, like,
"Hello, nice to meet you, I'm Chief Fahker."

No.

I swear to God.

I'm, like, "I'm sorry,
Chief, Chief Fahker?"

He's like,
"Yeah, Chief Monther Fahker."

I cannot shake this man's
hand with a straight face.

Whoa.
Whoa, Ridell.

You did that on
purpose, Monther Fahker.

I swear I didn't, Sergeant.

We're still gonna make it to rendezvous
point with the crew at this rate.

And how far away
are we, Riddell?

Well, sir, I, I believe that we crossed
Route Aeros just a few blocks back.

Like, a, a little,
little while back.

In other words,
you have no idea?

Yeah, I, I have no idea, sir.

Lieutenant, I can
tell you where we are.

No, no, no, I want Specialist
Riddell here to figure it out.

Sir, I.
Fine, I will do it.

The Army in its infinite wisdom has,
after all, provided us with these very

excellent, hitech,
navigational systems.

Sir, I'd like to note a
rooftop anomaly, nine o'clock.

Are those, are those goats?

I believe that's the case, sir.

Jassim, why, why would they
put goats on their roof?

Where else would one put
goats to keep them safe?

Good, good point, Jassim.

Good, good point.

Okay, looks like we are at
Routes Fox and Florida, boys.

We got to back this
thing up, Riddell.

Wait, back it up?

Don't shit your pants, Riddell.

I'm gonna throw up.

Specialist Wild, do not throw up
in my Victor, that's an order.

I'll try, Sergeant B.

Holy shit, yeah,
that's a goat's head.

How is this warrior's work?

Babysitting shit suckers.

Well, welcome to
Sadr City, Jackson.

Sergeant Hayhurst, advise the convoy,
we have a truck approaching from 6:00,

another pep squad
for Mookie alSadr.

Again?

Maybe we'll get lucky this
time they'll try a driveby.

Yeah, I doubt it.

All Comanche Reds, this is Red Four, be advised
we've got a pep squad approaching, over.

Muqtada, Muqtada,
Muqtada, Muqtada.

Muqtada, Muqtada.

All Comanche Reds, Red
One, be civil, over.

Muqtada, Muqtada,
Muqtada, Muqtada.

Muqtada, Muqtada.

Down USA, down USA, down USA.

Yeah, I'll give you USA.

Pansyass pussies.

Hey, Mookie alSadr.

What's he so pissed
off at us for?

Well, did we drop a bomb here
at some point or something?

No, the Iraqis made this
place all by themselves.

So why follow that ugly mug?
The family name.

All sector's named after his dad, Grand
Ayatollah Saddam had wasted some years back.

Mookie wants the streets for
himself, just wants us out of here.

Yeah, whose gonna do that for him, those
guys, the big and bad Sadr Bureau?

I think I want my money back.

<i>Advisory to all units, all
outbound First Armored.</i>

<i>Division elements must complete
loading by 17:45 hours.</i>

<i>I say again, all outbound First Armored
Division elements must complete loading</i>

<i>by 17:45 hours.</i>

<i>Transfer of authority is 18:00.</i>

All incoming patrols report quiet, a few
sporadic demonstrators still angry over

the CPA shuttering alHawza, but
nothing like the marchers yesterday,

looks to be finally be
calming down on that front.

All right, good.

Once this business of transition is over,
let's set meetings with all the local

leaders and go to the status of our
projects, any security issues.

What our men seeing so far?

Main issue in the most
depressed areas remains theft.

One of my patrols saw two men on Route Texas
yesterday trying to saw into a live main

to steal a wire for copper.

Well, that's industrious.

Also, we got generators at two local hospitals
failing because people are drilling

into them, trying
to siphon fuel.

Brother Randazzo,
what do you have?

I'm still concerned with the
tone of Friday's sermons.

Not just alSadr, but
other midlevel clerics.

Marked uptick in antiAmerican sentiment,
more calls to end the occupation.

I'm not surprised, alSadr
blames us for all the problems,

takes credit every time
the power flicks on.

All we can do is
lead by example.

You think that'll do it, sir?
I do.

Think of it as a drum
beat, Brother Denomy.

Every time we do something good
here, it's a beat of that drum.

Now, if we keep doing it, that beat is gonna
grow faster and stronger until eventually we

are going to drown out all
those negative voices.

I hope people are going to see
amazing things from us here.

And in less than one hour, this place
is officially ours for the year.

Duties permitting, I'd like everyone present
for the transfer of authority, okay?

Yes, sir. - All our patrols back?
Comanche Red is still out, sir.

Aguero.

All right, still to come.
I want candy, just give me. -Okay, okay, wait, wait.

Okay, okay.

All right, I think
I got some candy.

Okay, relax.

It's for you, it's for you,
he's going in my pocket.

Okay, okay, that's it.

Sir, sir, sir.

Guzman, doc, come here a minute.

What's up?

See what you can do about this.

Jassim, let him know
we're gonna help him.

He's a tough kid, guess out
here he's got to be?

He is gonna need to
see a doctor though.

What these?

It's widely believed here
they have XRay vision.

This, the sunglasses?
Yeah.

You want them, ask him
if he want, you want them?

Yeah?

Yeah, yeah, he wants it,
he wants it.

Let's see, pull back?

Do you think you
could do it, Wild?

Do what?
Shoot a kid.

If it came to that.

I don't know man,
hope I never have to.

No matter what?

You'd let one of them
put a bullet in you?

Shut up.

Something's happening.

Sir.
What? -Tanker crew.

Hey, son of a bitch.

All Comanche Reds, remount.

Come on now, go.

Let's go.

What do you think happened, sir?

I don't know, man.

Something spooked them.

Sir, everybody's in.
Riddell, go.

Are you nervous?

A little.

Don't be,
it's a quick introduction.

Good Palm Sunday.

Good Palm Sunday
morning, everyone.

I'm LeAnn Volesky, I'm one of the
Family Readiness leaders here on base.

Just a quick announcement, we are
collecting supplies for care packages to be

sent over to Iraq.

I also wanted to introduce Gina Denomy,
one of our new Care Team leaders.

Thank you.

Hello, I am Gina,

well, I just really like to say that I very
much look forward to working with all of you.

And this is Merrick.

Thank you.

Deployments can be hard
in ways you don't expect,

always remember that
you're not alone.

Family Readiness is family.

There is no rank among us here,
flyers in the back have our numbers.

Call us, day or night.

We're here for you.

Thank you, LeAnn, very much.

I'd like to begin
with a word of prayer.

Elijah, come on, Elijah.

Go away.

Please.
Get up, Elijah. -So, can we talk?

I'm not hungry.

What if breakfast was waffles?

We could go out.

In fact, we have to go out.

Do you remember what today is?

Doesn't the gang have
a mystery to solve?

It's<i> Scooby Doo</i> day!

Okay, hey, but you have
to be ready in 10 minutes.

Race you.

I wanna see those teeth brushed.

What the hell?

You should've seen
your face, your face.

You're an asshole, Martin.

What's going on?

That, yo, someone
get that thing.

I'm on it, bro.

Shit, it went in, man.

No, man, no.

I got this, I got this.

Yo, what're you doing, Young?

Get a knife or something.

Hell, take my rifle.

It's all right.

All right, you see
the size of that thing?

Martin, I'm gonna kill you.

Come on, soldiers,
it's just a baby.

That's a baby?
It's your new best friend.

Yow, it's just a
camel spider, man.

They don't even bite, I
wouldn't do you like that.

It's actually a
whiptail scorpion.

Yeah, they're harmless.

You put that thing on me, you
don't even know what it was?

I thought it was.
Asshole. -All right, I'm sorry, holmes.

Yo, what're you doing here, anyway
ain't you supposed to be on patrol?

Damn man, I missed the rollout.

"Saddam's Revenge"
got me on the toilet.

Maybe because you ate
one of these things.

What the hell is
this supposed to be?

Is this chicken?

Damned if I know.

Anybody got any hot
sauce or something?

Arsiaga.

Man, if you don't
want that, I'll eat it.

You like this shit?

Hey, we're in a war zone, Garza.

Crazy.

Thought you wanted Afghanistan.

Yeah, I did, this
is the war I got.

What do you know about it?

War.

You ever even been shot at?

I have.
I'm not asking you, Specialist.

I'm asking PFC Young.

That's not what I.
That's not what?

No Staff Sergeant, I
have never been shot at.

You ever fired your
weapon at a human being?

No Staff Sergeant.

Well, then do me a
favor and shut up.

Ain't nothing out there like
you think it is, nothing.

You know, ain't no training gonna prepare
you, there's no glory out there, no heroes,

it's just death and rot.

Close eye on our six.

He says you have to
let them go, they've quit.

All of them.

Why?

He says a man came over at the last pump
site and told them they'd be killed,

them and their families that anyone
working for the Coalition is now

an enemy of AISadr.

Okay, Jassim, ask him.

Hold up, sir, he
left something out.

Targets, infidels.

So you've missed
that part, Jassim?

He said he and his men are tired of having
targets on their backs with the infidels.

I was trying to be polite.

How about do your job?

Okay Jassim, tell this man he doesn't
have to be afraid and our men our

troops will protect him.

He says, "You Americans say that,
but how will you protect us?"

"How will you protect us and our
families tonight when you're back safe"

behind your base walls?

"You can't and we have to live here after
you are gone." What do you wanna do, sir?

Let them go.

Yes, sir.

That's what they said, that they and
their families would be killed,

that anyone working for us now
was AISadr's enemy, over.

Copy that, Red One.

Swing by AISadr Bureau on your way back,
just make sure nothing's brewing, over.

<i>Copy that, Comanche Six, over.</i>

Comanche Six out.

It looks quiet.

All right, Riddell, this
is Delta, turn left here.

AISadr Bureau's
just up the road.

Sir, should we get some guys
together for a game tonight?

God yes please.

Jassim, you interested?

What is this?
What's DND?

Dungeons & Dragons.
What's Dungeons & Dragons? -You'll see.

Sergeant, AK, 9:00.

Whip us around.

Red One, this is Red Four.

We got a potential
hostile with an AK, over.

Hey.

Just listen to what I'm saying!

Let me take over, Sergeant.
Please.

Jassim, please translate.

I'm Lieutenant Shane Aguero
of the First Cavalry.

Coalition rules prohibit
public possession of weapons.

These men must disarm and hand over
their rifles, they must do so, now.

He, he says the weapons are, um,
registered and permitted to protect the.

Mosque and the Imam.

Who are they affiliated with?

Sadr Bureau, KDP, SCIRI?

Have your men take
custody of the weapons.

All right, come on,
let's call this in.

Sergeant, you're with me.

Yup.

Come on, come on, move it.

Lancer Mike, Comanche Red One, I need
Comanche Six or Lancer Six, over.

Red One, this is
Lancer Six, go ahead, over.

Lancer Six, we have a group of
armed men at the Mosque on Delta,

south of the Sadr Bureau, they said that
they're SCIRI, permitted to carry to protect

the Mosque.

We have taken custody
of their weapons.

What is your guidance, over?

Is that true?

There is a Coalition rule
that allows for armed guards

inside Mosque perimeters.

Enacted after a string
of Sunni attacks.

Red One, do you see any evidence
of hostile intent, over?

Negative Lancer Six, over.

Sir, the guy was on the street.

Lancer Six, Red Four reports one of the men
was on the street with his weapon, over.

No evidence of hostile intent.

Let's try to keep the peace.

Red One, return the weapons.

Advise the guards a proper adherence to the
rules or we will have to confiscate them

and then return to base, over.

Roger that, Lancer Six, over.

All right, give them back.

Jassim, tell them our mistake but
they've got to stick to the rules.

No weapons outside of the
Mosque or we will take them.

All right, all
Comanche Reds, remount.

This is bullshit.

Staff Sergeant Miltenberger?

They opened up the phones,
don't you wanna call home?

I said everything
I needed to before I left.

All right then.

From the Gospel
of Matthew, Chapter 21.

As they approached Jerusalem and came
to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives,

Jesus sent two disciples
saying to them.

Israel?

Baby, sweetie.

I can't believe it's you.

I'm in church, baby.

Untie them and bring them to me.

If anyone ask anything.

Are you okay?

I've been so worried.

You always worry too much, babe.

They just opened up the phones.

Got Arsiaga here, too.

Hey, Lupe.

Hey listen, um, I don't got a lot of time
but I, I wanted to tell you about this

dream I had last night,
it was amazing Lupe.

And I, in it, I, I was already back and we
were all together, just, just hugging and,

and kissing, and it
was so real, baby.

I, I woke up hugging my rugsack.

Lucky Arsiaga wasn't next to me or he would've
woken up to me trying to hump his ass.

I love you so much, baby.

But don't worry, you hear me?

We're gonna be fine.

Sergeant Chen, thought you'd be
joining us for D&D after chow?

Never again sir, definitely not.

Come on sir, who'd
Sergeant Chen even be?

He could be a bard.

Guys!

Where the hell is everyone?

Whoa, whoa, listen.

Was that.

Comanche Reds, this is Red Four.

We have contact.

Looks like a lone shooter.

Moving to isolate, over.

All Comanche Reds, Red One, halt and
move to Red Four's position, over.

Come on, Riddell.

Get us back there.

Come on, go, go.

Anyone see the shooter?

Negative.

Lancer Mike, this
is Comanche Red One.

We have received fire.

Route Delta, just south
of the Sadr Bureau, over.

Red One, Comanche Six,
what type of fire, over?

Comanche Six, unclear, over.

Ambush.

All Comanche Reds, remount.

Get back in your vehicles, over.

My plate caught them,
my plate caught them.

Get in, everybody remount.

Comanche Six, this is Red One.

We have renewed contact, over.

Red One, how heavy
is the contact, over?

What?

How heavy is your contact, over?

Really damn heavy.

We're in a complex ambush.

Everyone's in.

Go, Riddell.

Come on, go, go.

Man.

Sir?
Punch us through.

You sure?
Yes.

Chen, inside now.

Everybody okay?

Yeah.

Man, sir, there's
no one following.

Shit.

I don't see them either.

Stop the vehicle, Riddell.

Stop, stop, stop.

All Comanche Reds,
this is Red One.

Do you copy, over?

All Comanche Reds, come in.

You don't see them?

No, sir.

Turn us around.
What?

Two of those Victors
have no armor, Riddell.

Come on, we got
to get back fast.

Anyone got a visual?

Negative, sir.

What the hell happened here?
Looks like RPG hits.

Red Four, this is Red One.

What the hell is going on, over?

Red Four, come in.

Their antennas
must've got shot up.

Riddell, stop here.

Wait for me here.

What?

Wait, sir, where are you going?

Let's go, let's go, floor it.

Perry, you okay?
Yes, sir.

Punch it.
Bourquin, what is going on? -Enemy fired two RPGs.

Perry evaded but his engine
and windshields got blown out.

Three hit a barricade
and got pinned down.

Taylor, punch it again.

Come on, are you kidding me?

Son of a bitch.

Sir, these two Vics
are dead light.

We got to get the hell
off of this street.

We cannot fit 19 men
inside the two Victors.

We need to find shelter.

All right, empty out the
equipment from the two Victors.

Zout the radios.

Roger that, two
and three dismount.

Shit.
We leaving now? -Chen?

Where's he hit?

I don't know.
Is he okay?

How bad is it?

It's bad, he's not breathing.

Jassim, Jassim.

Do you know CPR?

Yes.
Start.

Fisk, on the .50 cal,
return fire.

Comanche Six, this is Red One.

Fisk.

Comanche Six, this is Red One.

We need QRF support
and immediate evac.

We have an urgent surgical,
two vehicles down.

I repeat, we need
immediate evac, over.

Red One, Comanche Six,

find a secure defensive position
and wait for extraction.

We're coming, over.

Be ready to move.

Hey, Red Platoon, we are moving.

Time, now.

Get in the cover of your
armored Victors, come on.

Hey, Guzman, look at me.

Hand that stuff off
to somebody else.

Chen's been hit.

What?
Understand?

Go.

Bring it in, let's go.

Go, go, go, come on, hurry.

Sir.
How bad is it? -I don't know.

All right, look, we
got to move, okay?

Let's go.

Hey!

You.

Cover across.

Sergeant, alley.

Are you sure you're not worried?

There has only been one incident in
the entire city in the last year.

We're not even bringing
the heavy armor.

If there's a gun going off of there,
it's probably just some fool celebrating

a Cowboys game.

Well, it never hurts
to be extra sure.

An amulet of magical armor?
It's the most important one.

Rogers, give me two
above the cross, go.

Sergeant. - Slow down, Danny.
Sergeant, that rooftop.

Roger that.

Cover across.

Watch these doors.

What is their current position?

Unknown, sir.

What?

The trackers aren't active yet.

Computer is still connected
to the outgoing unit.

How the hell are
we gonna find them?

We need some IVs.

Alex, it's time for breakfast.

I'm not eating unless
it's chocolate pancakes.

Alex, I'm counting to three.

One, two, two and a half.

We have a Christmas tree?
Yes, we do. -But it's not Christmas.

That's true.

But since I'm not gonna be
here for Christmas this year,

I thought maybe we
could celebrate early.

What do you think?

Do you want your
present now or later?

Now, now, now.

No way, Mom, look.

My gosh, more cars.

That's just what you need.

What do you say to your daddy?

Thanks, dad.

Merry Christmas, son.

Do you wanna play cars with me?

Not now sweetheart,
how about after we eat?

All right, you heard
your mom, let's go.

Wow, this looks incredible, hon.

Thank you.

Chocolate, my favorite.

It's your daddy's favorite, too.

Alex, would you like to
say grace this morning?

Um, okay, dear Lord, thank you
for the food we're about to eat.

Please watch over my
daddy when he's in Iraq.

Don't let him get hurt by the bad
guys or fall in a hole and get lost.

Please keep him safe from
scorpions and big bears.

Alex, I don't think there
are any big bears in Iraq.

Mom, I wasn't done.

I'm sorry, so on.

Please protect my daddy from small
bears and medium bears, too.

Don't let him break
his arm or his leg.

Don't let him get blown
away by a tornado.

Took the car in
for an oil change.

It should be good for a while.

Did I tell you that Alex offered to
mow the lawn while you were gone?

Did he really?

He had a serious face on.

He said, "Mom, I know that
daddy always mows the lawn."

When he's in Iraq, I can do it."

He's a good kid.
You're his hero.

You know who's
my hero, my heroine?

It's you, I mean it.

With you here, I know I don't have
to worry about anything or anyone.

Sir, ma'am, I'd like
to introduce my mother.

Mom, this is Lieutenant Colonel
Volesky, our Battalion Commander.

It's a pleasure, ma'am.

Maybe you can explain to me
why my son is going to Iraq,

when the terrorists who
attacked us are in Afghanistan.

Mom, I'm sorry, sir.
It's okay.

You let your mother speak.

We've found Saddam Hussein, but no
sign of those WMD's we were promised.

That was all lies.

I don't mind your candor.

And to answer your question, as a soldier,
your son goes where the United States.

Government sends him.

And right now, our
orders are to go to Iraq.

Why, so we can have cheaper gas?

Where we're going, Sadr City,
over two million people lived

under a dictator's
boot for 24 years.

And we can build a better future
for them, for the whole country.

That's why we're going.

That's why your son is going.

You believe that?

That's why I do what I do.

Please, bring my baby home.

I promise you.

Every man is coming back safely.

How can you promise that?

Because I believe that too.

And because it's
my responsibility.

Come here.

Staircase, left.

Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Hey, freeze, freeze.
Come down slowly, slowly.

Come slowly, come really slow.

Wild, secure him.

What the hell is she saying?

Please.

Come to me, slow, slowly.

Shit, Wild, on me.

Stop, stop.

Perry, watch her.

Jackson, you're with me.

Haubert, Bellamy,
search the kitchen.

Stay frosty.

Every household's permitted
an AK here, let's go.

Stop, on the ground.

How is he?

I don't know.

<i>Red One, this is Lancer Six.</i>

You got him?
Yeah, go.

Over here in the shade, come on.

Come on, help
me get this Kevlar off.

Everything off now.

Jackson, give me one.

Please, no hurt.

Slowly.

Jackson, secure her.

Jackson, take her downstairs.

Wild, Rob?

Up here, Sergeant B.

Sergeant Rob got us roof access.

Well, scope it out.

I gotta go check on Chen.

Chen.

What do you got, doc?

Put her down.

Sir, we got roof access.

It's good, high
ground advantage.

Sergeant Rob's up there now.

All right, Perry.
Yes, sir. -You stay with the family.

Jackson, everyone else, to
the roof, set a perimeter.

Come on, let's go.

How is he doing?

He's not breathing.

Sir, I have Colonel Volesky.

What do we do, doc?

I got to take care of his wound.

Hey, we're fixing
you up, all right?

Lancer Six, Comanche
Red One, over.

Quiet at the TOC!

Comanche Red One, we
need your coordinates.

The GPS trackers in your
vehicles are not active, over.

Contact began north of the
Mosque near the Sadr Bureau,

continued for some time.

The Mosque is right here.

I'm not really sure of
our current position.

We turned right down
an alleyway, break.

Lancer Six, I have a litterurgent
soldier in need of evac.

It's Sergeant Chen, sir, over.

Copy that, Red One.

You stay vigilant.

Help is on the way.

Lancer Six out.

Stay here, keep them informed.

Squad leaders cover their
own guys, understood?

Copy that.

Relay a basewide alert for all
men to get into combat gear.

Yes, sir.

All right, he's been hit between
his fourth and fifth rib.

Yeah.

I need a JTube,
I got to open up his airway.

All right, what's his status?

At least one lung is punctured.

All right, you hold this one.

Put pressure on that right
there, put pressure on it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What can I do to help?
Sergeant B. -Yeah?

Give me short breaths in
cycles of two when I tell you.

I need you to alternate with
compressions when I tell you, all right.

Here we go, one, two,
three, four, five.

Go ahead and
breathe for us, bud.

Come on Chen,
breathe that out for me.

I sent them to the Sadr Bureau.

You let that go, brother.

They timed this attack to the change
in authority for maximum chaos.

It could've been
anyone's platoon.

All right, now,
let's work this out.

We've got the men and the vehicles to
extract, but we don't have the heavy weapons

or the armor to penetrate.

We have what, a handful
of Bradleys at the most?

What about the
outgoing unit's QRF?

The Crusaders, 237
Armor Battalion.

They've stood down.

Their deployment's over.

They're leaving for Kuwait now.

You get me their commander.

With their tanks leading,
we take two convoys in.

Rescue 1 will link up with
those Crusaders, God willing,

make contact with
the Platoon and extract.

Let me lead Rescue 1,
they're my guys.

Very good.

I'll take Rescue 2,
I'll be 15 minutes behind you.

Secure a wide corridor
around the target.

And we're gonna take
the same corridor in.

We'll go Route Aeros
to Copper to Delta.

We'll link up here.

Before we launch, we wait for the Crusader
tanks to penetrate the enemy defenses.

Roger that.

All right, let's brief the men.

Get the convoys assembling.

Yes, sir.

Hey, we'll get
them home, brother.

We'll get them home.

<i>Crusader XRay, this is
Lancer Six.</i>

Lancer Six, this is Duke Six.

Duke Six, I understand that you've stood
down, but I have troops in contact

north of the
Sadr Bureau on Route Delta.

I need immediate deployment of your QRF
to help extract, is this possible, over?

Lancer Six, we've turned in all our
main gun ammo but we'll fight out

of the hatches if we have to.

The QRF will deploy.

Will advise once en route, over.

Thank you, Duke Six.

Lancer Six out.

Order Lieutenant Dean to
set the QRF to Redcon One.

No weapons inside.

We found access to
the adjacent rooftop.

Haubert and Davis have the perimeters
set with Rogers, Denney, and Taylor.

I don't see any hostiles.

Maybe it's over?

No, no, they're just regrouping.

Wild, with me, we got to
bring up more ammo, let's go.

All right, we're gonna swap out.

Roger that.
Okay, go.

Go ahead and
breathe it out, bud.

Hey, what are you doing?

His lungs are filled with blood.

You're not giving up.
Chen, Chen. -Come on, Chen.

Wake up for me, come on.

Come on Chen., come on.

Breathe for me, Chen.

Come on, come on, brother.

Wake the hell up.

Come on, Chen.

No!

You, what did you do?

What, I didn't do anything.

I tried to help.

He did the best he could,
Sergeant, stand down.

Sir, this was a wide
wellplanned ambush.

People knew.

Those men at the mosque knew.

Somebody tipped the enemy
off to our movements.

And it's usually
the interpreters.

Are you an informant, Jassim?
No, absolutely not, sir.

Jassim, look at me right now.
Yeah. -Look at me.

Did you do this?

I was helping him.

I did everything I could.

Guys, listen up.

This man was in my Humvee.

He got shot at just
like the rest of us.

And he tried to save
Chen, you understand?

There's nothing Jassim or anybody
could have done to save Chen.

You don't know that.
Yeah, I'm a damn medic. -Enough already.

Enough, both of you.

You guys wanna make it back to
base without any more casualties?

Now, we have to work
together, is that clear?

Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. -Is that clear?

Yes, sir.
Then move.

Grab the dismount and get the
rest of the ammo up to the roof.

Sergeant Bourquin, that
was a direct order.

Sergeant.

You okay, Jassim?

I wanna apologize.

We're all just
emotional right now.

I understand.

Go inside.

Find Perry, he could
use an interpreter.

Alk to.

There they are, just a moment.

Go, go.

Mrs. Volesky, Mrs. Donemy,
I'm Lupita Garza.

Israel is a Specialist
with the 25.

So is Angel's brother,
Robert Arsiaga.

The twins?

Yeah.

We just heard something
happened in Sadr City.

I don't understand, I
just spoke to Israel.

My friend's husband is
stationed in Baghdad.

He told her there was radio
chatter, something about an ambush.

My God.

Okay, let's not
jump to conclusions.

There are always rumors during deployment,
and, and they're rarely true.

I know.

That's why I wanted to see you.

I mean, they would notify
Family Readiness, right?

We would be among the
first that they would call.

Look, I'm sure that
everything's fine.

LeAnn, what if
something did happen?

Let me call Dexter Jordan.

He's the Rear
Detachment Commander.

He would be the first
person they'd call.

Thank you so much.

Hi, Dexter, it's LeAnn Volesky.

Good.

Listen, apparently, there's some chatter
about an attack going on in Sadr City.

Have you heard anything?

Great, okay.

Thank you, no, I'll
talk to you soon.

There's no word of any trouble.

Thank God.
I'm so sorry.

I didn't mean to scare everyone.

Just this deployment's driving me
crazy and they've only just left.

I know the feeling.
We all do.

Israel's never even
been overseas, not once.

It is just a
peacekeeping mission.

He'll be fine.

They will all be fine.

How can you know?

Because in his 20 years in the Army, my
husband's never lost a man in combat.

Hey, bud, I,

I don't know if, I don't know
if you were a religious man,

but, I guess we never really
talked about that stuff?

Um, like, I don't really know when the
last time I went to mass was, but, um,

I guess if it's okay with you I'd
like to say a little prayer.

Dear Lord, I humbly entrust to
you my brother, Eddie Chen.

I pray that you may take him
into your arms, dear Lord.

Allow him entry into your paradise
that his soul may rest in peace.

In Your name, I pray.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

What's he going on about?

Um, he's just complaining
about being tied up.

Sergeant, 11:00.

The Humvees.

We got all the equipment.

Z'd out the radios, theres
nothing left for the enemy.

No, not that.

We can use them as
markers for the rescuers.

The minaret they can see from miles away,
but those can help pinpoint our position.

That's good.

Okay look, I get it, okay?

You're upset about
Chen, so am I.

Not everyone here is the enemy.

Yeah, I know that.
These men look up to you.

They follow your lead.

I need to know that you can still
work with Jassim, understand?

Roger that, sir.

Yeah, all right, yeah.

Sarge?

Yeah, I see her.

Hey Riddell, are you okay?

Yeah!

Sir, we got a peeker!

West wall, hundred meters out!

Take him out!

Holy sh...

Hey guys, Riddell just
got himself a head shot!

Hell, yeah.
All right.

Yeah.
Whoa. -Good job there, Riddell.

<i>Crusader XRay, this
is Crusader Blue One,</i>

<i>approaching the
perimeter of Sadr City.</i>

<i>No sign of hostile activity.</i>

Can you believe
it's only our day four here?

Home feels about a million miles
away right now, doesn't it?

Yeah.

I've been meaning to ask you,
someone said you're a teacher for a

atrisk youth or something?

Back in Arkansas, yeah.

Why?

Back home, I was atrisk youth.

Yet here we both are.

Here we both are.

The Crusaders are en route.

We'll launch soon,
what's our status?

Almost ready, sir.

Armor's a concern.

Some of the vehicles we can reinforce, but
the LMTVs have no protection in the back.

Plus we only have four
Bradleys, two for each convoy.

Yeah, with the Crusaders,
that should be sufficient.

I'll take the LMTV's in
the rear of my convoy.

Roger.

Also we're short on radios.

All right, let's get an order
out to all team leaders.

You maintain visual contact with
your convoy at all times, got it?

Yes, sir.

This is crazy.

We'll be sitting ducks.

And we'd be able to aim out.

We're just gonna be
guarding the cordon.

Guess you ain't nervous
if you're bringing a book.

I just don't wanna lose it.

What is it, anyway?

It's just war poetry.

What's this,
it's book club meeting?

And when we're out there, and this, this
goes for all of you, hey, listen up.

Remember that simple rule, the
only thing you'll be focused on,

the only thing that can keep you and your
fellow soldier safe is that you cover your

sector, and trust the man next to
you is doing the same, that's it.

You, you lose focus,

you try to be a hero, you
end up dead, that clear?

Yes, sergeant.
Yes, sergeant.

Yes, sergeant.
Okay, sergeant.

Is, that it Staff Sergeant?

Staff Sergeant, aren't we
heading out a few minutes?

What is his deal?

Don't worry about it, man.

Dude's a crank, but he's been doing
this a hell of a lot longer than us.

He's a solid soldier.

Is he?

What else would they've stoplossed
him and made him come here?

That's what I'm worried about
is to follow that guy's lead.

Hey, do you think I got time
to call Tracie before we go?

Yeah, I think we
have a few minutes.

Tracie's gonna be pissed.
She's gonna be proud.

Lupe's gonna be pissed.

May I help you, Staff Sergeant?

You want something for the road?

I think I'd like
to sit down for a meal

actually if you
have something left.

Sure, do you have time?
Yeah, yeah, I have time.

Time for just one last meal.

Red One, Lancer Six, over.

<i>Lancer Six, we've spotted our two
immobilized Victors on Delta.</i>

<i>Our position is approximately 250
meters northwest down an alley, over.</i>

Solid copy, Red One.

QRF is on its way.

Prepare your men for exfil and
evac of the wounded, over.

Lancer Six, Sergeant
Chen is dead, sir, over.

Copy that, Red One.

I'm sorry.

Continue your prep.

Six out.

I promised Chen's parents
I'd get him home safe.

I promised to all of them.

Sir, you're needed at the TOC.

Something has
happened to the QRF.

Sir, the Crusaders
have been ambushed.

What?

<i>Mitchell is dead, sir.</i>

<i>I repeat, Sergeant
Mitchell has been killed.</i>

<i>First Lieutenant Dean and Specialist
Sanders have both been hit.</i>

<i>Blue Two is black on coax.</i>

<i>All Crusader Blues, Blue One, abort
and pull back for casualty evac.</i>

<i>We cannot continue, over.</i>

How is Alex handling everything?

Well, he knows his Daddy is helping
people in foreign country.

But...

He just doesn't understand he
can't come home more often.

He's a very brave little boy.

Yes, he is.

You know, we almost lost
him when he was first born.

Really?
He was born at 25 weeks.-

So underweight and, and the doctor
thought that he might not live the night.

But he was a fighter.

Gary and I decided right then and
there we were just gonna love him,

every day of his life, and then
that was two days or 200 years.

Troy and I didn't even know if he'd
be here when Merrick was born.

Now I guess the upside is he's too
young to really miss his dad.

The thing I worry about is if he
comes back different, you know.

We hear stories about guys
who come back changed and...

He's in good hands with Gary.

And the Lord never gives us
more than we can handle.

I wish I had your faith.

I just believe that what's
meant to happen will happen.

And there's no point worrying
about it until it does.

Just like Daddy's car?

It's not a car, it's a Humvee.

Sir, our police liaison reports
alSadr's militia has seized control

of all police stations.

Apparently, the men who attacked
the Crusaders ambushed them

using police uniforms.

This is citywide, sir.

There's no one else right now.

Just us.

What are your orders, sir?

We launch now.

Sir, the Crusaders still
have to complete casevac...

There's no time.

It could take an hour.

It could take several until they're
back in the fight and to target.

Our guys don't have that long.

We launch.

Brother Randazzo, the Crusader
loader who was killed, Mitchell,

you find out his first name
and where he was from.

Yes, sir.

Sir, shouldn't the
QRF be here by now?

They'll be here.

Have no fear, Fisk,
it's not your time yet.

The big man upstairs knows you still
plan to whoop my ass in some D&D.

I will, too.

I'll be on the roof.

Get me if there's an update.

Yes, sir.

Put this on.

Sir.

Put it on.

Sergeant Chen doesn't
need his armor anymore.

Someone should use it.

Good.

I might need you
in the fight, too.

You want one?

Yeah, thanks.

Thanks.

I remember the first day we got
here, we drove by a car crash.

The driver was still inside, all bloodied
and shit, been dead for two days.

Yeah.

And I'm just making the point.

There's a dead guy laying in the middle of
the street with flies crawling out of his

eyeballs and nostrils, not one
person cared enough to even stop.

Maybe these
people are just numb.

I mean, look at this place.

People must drop
dead here every day.

Screw them.

We're here to clean up their shit
up and they're pissed at us?

We did invade and occupy
their country, Riddell.

To get rid of Saddam Hussein.

The asshole who abused them.

And we don't do this.

These people use their kids.

And who does that?

Look around you, what's
death to living in this shit?

Paradise.

That's great for them.

They've made me
into, into a killer.

I hope they're happy.

What the hell was that?

Sir.

Come in.

Sir, the Crusaders
loader you asked about,

Sergeant Michael W. Mitchell,

from Porterville, California.

He volunteered for
the mission, sir.

He was 25, about to be married.

Thank you, brother.

Lord, please care for Sergeant Chen and
Sergeant Mitchell and their families.

Bless them for their sacrifice and let
them be the last to fall in this battle.

Send me those
angels you promised.

<i>Red platoon reports two
Victors have been abandoned.</i>

The Crusaders got ambushed.

We got to go ahead alone.

I'll give the order to roll.
Godspeed, brother.

I'll be 15 minutes behind you.

Let's get the boys back.

All right, Comanche Whites,
mount up, we're rolling.

Everyone ready, Weibley?

Ready, sir.
Spicer? -Ready.

Chaplain, would you say
a blessing for a second?

Of course, sir.

Merciful God, we ask you to bring peace
to these men as they go out in faith.

Give them courage, Lord.

Courage to perform their
duties with honor and dignity.

May they be triumphant in victory
as they show mercy to our enemies.

Out of the depths, we
call to you, O Lord.

Protect these men.

Be their constant companion
and their strength in battle.

Though they may enter the unknown
let their fate be of comfort.

Bless these brothers and help them
remain steadfast in their mission.

Give each men renewed
strength and purpose.

Cast away any sense of fear they may
have, and give them solace in the

face of adversity.

Guide them, O Lord, that
they may return in safety.

Hear our voices,
O Lord, bring them home.

This we ask of you.

In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Amen.

They're all leaving.

Commanche 6, we have urgent surgical,
need an immediate evac, over.

Find a secure defensive position and
wait for extraction, we're coming.

This is a skilled and highly prepared enemy
who has coordinated a citywide attack.

We can go that way.
It's a trap.

The whole
platoon's been attacked.

Who are the wounded?
We don't have any information.

Come on baby, guide us home.
