Get out the streets, invest in something legit.

It's not that easy.

You always fucking say that.

I'm telling you it's not.

Don't worry about me.

Yeah. Hey, can I have two of my usuals?

Sure girl.

What's that about?

Nothin' really.

I mean, it has to be or you wouldn't stay here like that.

Speak your mind, sis.

Look Princess.

It's not really that serious.

Today is not about my job.

It's about getting you a job.

I mean, I know that,

but if something's bothering you,

I'm not about to sit her and ignore it.

Fuck a job.

Hey, Keisha,

That's what we was waiting on?

Yeah.

Hey, you from around here?

Yeah.

What's good to eat?

I don't know.

It depends on what you like.

Well, what do you like?

Look, Mr. I'd rather not talk.

I just want to get to my destination.

Oh my bad.

I'm sorry.

I'm new around here, okay?

I was just looking for something good to eat.

I'll leave you alone.

I see you don't want to be bothered.

No, I'm sorry.

I just,

I don't know.

You know, my mother always told me is

it's best to release things on your mind

before they hurt you.

I always love that saying of hers.

Hey, your mother sounds smart but,

I'm okay.

I'd rather not talk about it.

You know what I actually insist you do.

Maybe I can offer you a non-biased opinion.

Oh, it's not much, honestly.

I just got to really figure out how to get some money

and how to get it fast.

My brother's stuck in the streets.

I just found out my best friend

is stuck with a fuckin' pimp.

And I'm really the only one that can save them for real.

Damn, that sounds tough.

Man, tell me about it.

Look, maybe God put you in my car for a reason.

(laughs) Why you say that?

It actually turns out that I'm

looking for a new business partner.

Somebody to help me with this new venture of mine.

[Princess] Is that right?

Yeah, look, we did a test run last week

and we made a million dollars, easy.

A million dollars?

A million dollars. (laughs)

That's it?


Oh, so I see what this is.

You think I'm trying to run some type of con on you, huh?

Look, Mr.-

Omar.

Omar. I'm from the hood.

My brother is the biggest salesman I know.

I know when game being ran on me

so you can keep your little million dollar in a month

business venture.

I'm straight.

You know what?

I see why you so miserable.

Excuse me?

You get in my car like your whole world's about to end.

And then I try to give you an opportunity

and you're so close-minded,

you can't see it right in front of your face.

Close-minded?

Yeah, close-minded.

Look, do you get this upset when other people

turn you down too?

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Yeah, okay. I see you, ma'am.

You know what?

Princess.

Princess? - Yes.

All I wanted to do was just give you an opportunity.

Show you a way you can make some extra money.

That's all.

I made a million dollars.

Not saying you gonna do that.

But you know,

since you can't take 10 minutes out your busy schedule,

I'm gonna take you home.

And I'm gonna let you continue to figure it out.

(sad music)

You smooth.

I give you that.

Fuck it.

I don't have shit else to lose.

But I do have a question though.

What's that?

Why you do this driving shit?

I continue to meet people like you.

(upbeat music)

[Princess] What type of freaky shit is this?

[Omar] Trust me.

Come on.

(car engine revving)

Now look.

So, you sure you want to go home now?

How do I fit into all this?

It's simple.

My girls, they gonna hook you up.

Diamond, Sapphire,

I thought we were done recruiting.

Yeah, but you know we need some people for L.A.

and y'all gonna help her out.

So I hope you know what you're getting yourself into

because we don't need any more bitches.

Bitch, what?

Hey, hey, hey.

Yo, chill.

She probably needs this bread anyway.

You know what?

Hey, Princess.

â™ª Yeah

â™ª Everything is blast

â™ª And we won't get the playas

â™ª Cardinal

â™ª Everything is blast

(explosion blasts)

(lighter igniting)

Do you ever get tired of this?

Honestly?

Sometimes.

But then I see the reward

and I understand it's all a part of the crime.

You think about it all the time?

If you work for it,

yeah, but this shit ain't easy.

It's gonna take discipline,

complete focus.

Have you ever even had an encounter with Five-O?

Who you think you talking to?

Privileged Princess?

Shit, Five-O might as well have had an overnight bag

as much as he was at my house.

I ain't scared of Five-O.

It ain't about being scared of 'em.

It's about out-thinking them,

thinking before them.

Again, this shit ain't easy.

Look, if you expect to be successful in this business,

you need to be a student first.

Remember,

never try to outshine the master.

Look, I may talk my shit,

but I'm just here to help you, okay?

Okay.

All right.

Now let's get these bags in here.

All right.

(plastic snapping)

(suspenseful music)

(doors slamming)

(plastic rustling)

(doors slamming)

(door creaks)

(door closes)

Damn, another hotel?

No, that one was for counting money and distribution.

This one's for production.

Grab me one of those bags over there

and I'll show you how to do this.

(plastic rustling)

All right.

You see how some of these is still somewhat put together?

[Princess] Yeah.

Hand me that tape over there.

Here.

(tape creaking)

You gotta make sure the information matches.

(tape creaking)

Okay.

So what's all this for?

Tell me what you see.

(whispers)

Oh shit!

This is someone's whole life right here.

Exactly.

It's called data.

Omar preaches data.

So this among all the rest is how we get rich.

(door squeaks)

Okay.

I see you ladies getting acquainted, huh?

Uh, Diamond?

Where the fuck is Sapphire?

[Diamond] She said she had to take care of something.

She'll be back.

Uh hm.

I guess.

So, let me guess.

Data is key.

I'm still trippin' off this paper.

And then there's more?

Much more.

That's only a part of the business but,

it's the most key component of what we got goin' on here.

This information that we collect,

if it's local,

we go to the bank,

we get cold, hard cash.

But if it's out of town,

we create one of these.

Courtesy of my man, Jason.

So all you goin' do is swipe?

Only swipe.

But, we sell that information too.

Many people buy?

Shit, are they?

They buyin' like crackheads at the first of the month.

Now this is where the money really lie.

Formula.


Wait, I don't get it.

What we scientists now?

Algorithms.

Algo-who?

A series of encrypted codes that redirects

corporate payrolls to those credit cards.

Oh shit.

Omar, you a bad motherfucker.

[Diamond] I've been telling him that for years.

Now Princess,

you ready for your life to be changed?

I'm telling you.

It ain't goin' to be easy.

Easy.

Yeah, I know.

Let's get this work.

Let's go.

â™ª We came in with big straps

â™ª And these days they worry about what it costs â™ª

â™ª They know I stay solid

Let me see what Cali's thinking about Omar.

(flash bursts)

Now I knew something wasn't right.

Uber driver?

I should've known.

This nigga really tryna set me up.

(flash bursts)


(gun shots)

(tires squealing)

No, no, no.

No, don't do this to me.

Dae Dae, no No, no, no.


Dae Dae, no!

(sorrowful screaming)

No!

(door knocking)

(suspenseful music)

The motherfucking nerve.

The one you want to talk to is me.

Nigga, get the fuck out my house.

Or what, bitch?

Or I'm gonna send you to your maker, Nigga.

Look, no one else have to die tonight.

Keisha, shut the fuck up.

I can't believe you.

You killed Dae Dae.

You shot this thing over my crib.

What was that?

Where I lay my head at?

Princess!

Why don't you shut the fuck up?

Bitch right here is talkin' 'bout my shit.

Bitch put the money up for your house

Go such on a dick and pass out.

Or what, bitch?

(gun fires twice)

(eerie music)

So this what it come to?

You know me.

But that's all you brought,

plus pain and now loss.

Bestie, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Me too.

Princess, no.

(gun fires)

(dog barking)

(slow electric guitar)

â™ª Well you told me you were wrong with me â™ª

â™ª Never say how long

â™ª Always said that you was down all right â™ª

â™ª Just couldn't go far

â™ª No you couldn't hold your end â™ª

â™ª And so we keep fallin' off

â™ª Don't know why we keep pretending â™ª

â™ª Like these emotions are gone

â™ª To somewhere just wasn't sittin' right â™ª

â™ª We both had some issues

â™ª No that shit won't feelin' right â™ª

â™ª Got some pain deep in my heart â™ª

â™ª No it ain't hittin' right

â™ª Henny and shit ain't brought me down â™ª

â™ª But I'm still in a fight

â™ª It all comes with a price

(hitting thuds)

(angry crying)

â™ª Whoever knew we would go down this road â™ª

â™ª Would've kept the heat

â™ª If I knew I would get this far â™ª

â™ª There's a well of broken promises â™ª

â™ª Tell you don't wanna leave

â™ª Reason I can't trust nobody

â™ª 'Cause they just here for the season â™ª

â™ª Some telling me to turn back

â™ª For falling in love

â™ª I would rather fall in my back â™ª

â™ª Only one I trust

â™ª If you ever had crossed that line â™ª

â™ª There was gonna seal

â™ª When this shit get real

(tires screeching)

(cars thudding)

â™ª This shit get ice cold

â™ª I had to call out

â™ª Gave you all the playas

â™ª Just wanted to see you ball out â™ª

(plastic grating)

(laughing) Look at your ass now.

(coughing)

You tried to play me, huh?

Yeah, that's the problem with y'all female hustlers.

You try to run shit before it's your time.

Now look at you,

crawling, trying to walk.

Somebody should've taught your ass

a crash course on me, Princess.

'Cause now you just a crash dummy.

(gun cocks)

Fuck you.

Wipe that nigga up.

(gun shots)

â™ª I'm the only one got my back

â™ª When this shit get real

â™ª This shit get ice cold

â™ª I had to call out

â™ª Gave you all the playas

â™ª Just wanted to see you ball out â™ª

â™ª Lover showed you with it all out â™ª

â™ª So I can't show no more

I can't thank you enough.

I can't believe this thing, man.

Shit, shit like that happen when we get on top.

How did you know?

Shithead came and tried to order a hit on you.

I called Cali.

How do y'all even know each other?

I work for him.

Okay, Cali.

I see you weren't playing

when you said he was taking over, huh?

Why would I?

Here, I'm thinking,

you find a new connect in Atlanta, New York,

set up a meeting.

(voice becomes muffled)

Cali.

We gonna do things my way this go-around.

But, I need you.

Now I see why Omar chose you to run the operation

because he knew we can endorse you next king.

Let's go what you're talkin' about,

but know that I'm number one.

(woman's voice singing)


â™ª You gonna help me down and let me breathe â™ª

â™ª You supposed to make it easier for me â™ª

â™ª Instead of taking off my plates â™ª

â™ª Just let me eat

â™ª Let me eat sometimes

[Dae] What's happenin' Titi?

â™ª I gave my heart but you want my soul â™ª

â™ª Maybe you don't love me

â™ª Maybe I don't know

â™ª Maybe I just need some time

â™ª Maybe I just need some time

â™ª Maybe I need you to ease my mind â™ª

â™ª I need you to sit it on trust â™ª

What's up, love?

Hey you. How was your shower?

It was cool. It was cool.

Had a been way better if you was there with me.

But, I didn't feel you get up, though.

How long you been up?

A few hours.

Had another dream about Dae Dae again.

You know, I know all about that.

I lost my brother when I was 16 years old but,

you know, when he comes to me and my dreams,

I just use it as confirmation that he's still with me.

Yeah, I know that his spirit still lives.

Crazy thing is I busted my ass to get him off the streets,

just for him to die and me end up in the streets.

How's that happen?

Well, God works in mysterious ways but,

I mean, look around.

Look at where you're at now.

Did you expect to have all this?

Yeah, but not at this cost.

Well, I mean, I don't know exactly what it is that you do,

but what I do know is when you play with the devil,

eventually you gonna get burned.

What,

so you woke up from like a preacher today?

No I ain't no preacher, nothin' that like that.

I just need to stay level-headed, you know,

stay focused.

And know Dae Dae gonna be with you every step of the way.

Yeah,

you're right.

(phone buzzing)

Go ahead.

What?

Where?

Okay, okay, okay. Slow down.

Okay, give me 20 minutes. I'll be there.

Bye.

Yo, is everything okay?

Yeah, everything's fine.

Are you sure?

Didn't seem like a regular call.

Define regular, Crash.

Like, wow.

Okay, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

No I don't, exactly.

Define regular.

Because my regular is running a multimillion dollar empire.

What's your regular, huh?

Playin' preacher boy?

Or this to get into every girl pants that you meet?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

And try to tell them how to run their life, huh?

Is you serious right now?

No.

I'm sorry.

When do you leave town?

Tomorrow night.

Can I expect you tonight?

You tell me. Can you?

Tonight.

Tonight.

Yeah, meet me outside.


What the fuck is going on here?

I go for my morning run,

like I usually do.

And I come back

and this motherfucker in my office.

I asked him why.

He tell me,

Omar sent him.


So the motherfucker still alive, huh?

According to this thieving motherfucker.

Hey, why did Omar have you come here?

(spits)

You fucking spit on my?

Listen here, motherfucker

and you listen real good

or I decorate this place with your brains, you feel me?

Omar doesn't give a fuck about you.

I mean, why else do you think he had you come here,

knowing that you might get caught.

But he promised you something in return, hm?

Money, freedom, drugs.

Whatever it was,

he wasn't gonna fulfill on his end.

What you think he doin' right now, hm?

Not giving a fuck.

But you know what?

I see you don't give a fuck either.

Larue, cut this nigga head off.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

I'm a tell you, I'm a tell you.

What was that?

I said I'm a tell you.

Nah, you goin' show me.

Okay, okay.

(phone buzzes)

I'm gonna show you.

What's the word?

Yeah, meeting's at 3:00pm.

All right, I'll see you later.

Larue, go with this nigga to where he say Omar is at.

Hey, if you tryin' to fuck with me,

I'm gonna make your life a living hell.

Call me if you see it.

Goodbye, Princess.

Bye!

See y'all at three.

Alright. Alright.

You see that one right there.

That's where I met him.

I mean now tell me shit.

How do I know that ain't somebody else's room?

I said I'll show you where he is,

not give you proof.

Motherfucker, well you better figure out something

if you wanna live.

Look.

Ain't that him?

I told you.

Shut up.

I might be damned.

(suspenseful music)

I can't believe I'm saying this but,

I got a visual on your boy.

What you want us to do?

You want us to move in?

[Princess] Nah, not yet.

I got a plan.

You ready for the meeting?

Bet, say less.

What you want us to do with our other boy over here?

[Princess] Get rid of him.

Say less.

(suspenseful music)

(guns blasting)

(door closing)

All right, fellas, listen up.

Intel is telling us that these folks are all connected.

It's y'alls job to tell me how.

I want to know how this gas station clerk

goes from zero to hero.

What happened to her brother?

Where are they working?

What's their next move?

You mean to tell me that that woman

stole millions of dollars from top corporations in America

and no one even noticed?

Right underneath their goddamned nose.

Families have lost their businesses,

homes, property.

She deserves everything coming for her.

You bet.

So we think this mystery man is the one who's helping her?

We can only assume.

We may have a lead from this previous operation,

but it's an old one.

Yeah, but people like that,

they always keep moving.

They never sit still.

Well, all moving things come to a stop eventually.

Says no physicist ever.

Are you fucking kidding me?

I mean an object in motion stays in motion.

Are you fucking kidding me?

I'm just saying.

Hey, we gotta get on this now.

Listen, listen,

listen, gentlemen.

I'm just saying.

Listen.

I want you to run this lead with Reed.

I also want you to run a face recognition on this man,

using the Lexus database.

Reed.

I need to see you.

Okay.

Man, you fucked to see me.

Good luck.

Hey, hey, what the fuck was that?

My bad, man.

I mean, you know,

dealin' with a lot of personal shit, man at the crib.

[Chief] All right.

But more importantly, man,

I'm really pissed off that this is happening

right underneath our noses, man.

We gotta get on the bottom of this.

Yeah, I got it.

But hey listen.

Simpson's new, man.

I can't have that shit.

Are you cool? Are we good?

Let's get this.

Let's get these son-of-a-bitches, okay?

All right. You got it.

My bad.

Hey, I trust in you, man.

You're gonna take my spot, all right?

Got it.

â™ª Yeah

â™ª Let's go let's go

â™ª Yeah yeah yeah

â™ª They like to speak on the shit they don't know about â™ª

â™ª Stirring the pot

â™ª Trying to be in the midst

Can I ask you a question?

Sure.

Are you married?

No, why?

I'm sorry.

I'm just trying to figure out

who bought you this nice-ass Bentley up here.

(laughs) I wish I had a man that would buy me a car.

Yeah, I see that.

I think they don't make them anymore.

No.

But you know,

with prayers and hard work,

it comes.

I know, I know.

Where you from?

Puerto Rico.

Is that right?

Do you want to make some money?

â™ª Bitches and bands all over the place â™ª

â™ª You sign on your life

â™ª Before you hit it off

â™ª Whole gang cashing out

â™ª Don't care what it's costing

â™ª Anyone out around me is straight boss â™ª

â™ª That is some shit they don't know about â™ª

â™ª These real diamonds

â™ª This shit make a coat out

â™ª Put on a Visa

â™ª And this shit it be flooded

â™ª I'm making stacks off the push of a button â™ª

â™ª You should be down in this shit it was muddy â™ª

â™ª I got it out now this shit going dummy â™ª

I appreciate you for taking the time to meet with me.

I prefer my office but,

under certain circumstances.

And there's more where that came from.

All I ask for is your loyalty.

You keep these payments rollin' in and you got it.

I need you to understand that it's more than that.

The payments roll in based off your performance,

your value to me.

Do you understand?

If I wanted a pro bono lawyer

who was just interested in a dollar sign,

I would've got them.

But instead I have you,

the top criminal defense attorney in the state of Ohio.

I'm sure you didn't get that name

from just working for a check.

It's a passion.

That's what I need from you on this job.

Can you do that?

Of course.

Well, let's make it happen.

â™ª So now I'm running up to bat

â™ª Like it's you or me

â™ª Learning to speak to dead presidents fluently â™ª

â™ª Or version adrenal was broke to get high â™ª

â™ª Start seein' more money and maybe go at it â™ª

â™ª How I skip the rule and go straight to a panic â™ª

â™ª To see me keep going it's making her madder â™ª

â™ª Can't give her no time

â™ª If she ain't gonna wear the G â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I really don't want to remember â™ª

â™ª They got flesh for the grandma â™ª

All right. You see this?

This means it's a bear market.

The stock is dropping more than 20%.

We're gonna go in,

catch it at 17.28

buy about 3,000 shares,

and in about a week,

you'll see a 10K return on investment.

And this is safe?

You have an LLC, right?

Yeah, a couple.

Then you're okay.

Make sure you transfer the funds

from the LLC business account to us

and we'll take care of the rest.

And when should we expect payout?

Every other Thursday so that things don't look suspicious

when I make the large transfer every two payments.

For God's sake.

It's half a million dollars every two weeks.

Yeah, it's music to my ears.

â™ª That's just what happened

â™ª You ain't minding your business â™ª

â™ª Just blew a bag and we at it again â™ª

â™ª You can do this shit to you

â™ª And stack me your business

â™ª I can spend a whole bag

â™ª Get it right back

[Princess] This is Bug from silicone valley.

Jason can't fuck with him.

One time, Bug shut down all of Los Angeles

during the Lakers' game.

And they were playing home,

all from his mama apartment.

(low droning)

(door squeaks)

Oh, what did you do?

It wasn't me.

I was just playing a game.

Um hm. I'm telling mommy.

â™ª They like to speak on the shit they don't know about â™ª

â™ª Trying to pee in the midst

â™ª That's why I got situations

â™ª Stayed to myself

â™ª Trying to double my cake

â™ª Got eyes on my wallet

â™ª Trying to see what I make

â™ª Whole gang cashing out

â™ª I might skip the rule and go straight to a panic â™ª

â™ª To see me keep going it's making her madder â™ª

â™ª I can give her no time and she ain't come with. â™ª

Now I know everyone here

has something more important

that needs their attention more than this meeting.

So let me be the first to say

your presence is appreciated.

In the last six months,

we have established a solid network

allowing us to redirect payroll

from some of America's top corporations.

Recently,

an offer has been made for us to

distribute blow from Puerto Rico,

using our U.S. resources.

Among the other streams of income,

these two are our biggest.

Everyone here plays a vital role

in the success of our future.

Maria here is our international business affair officer.

She is going to handle the routes

and transportation of the cocaine.

Black,

Mac

and Tone,

you'll be her distributors for the Midwest.

(speaking in foreign language)

Alex here is one of the most talented

financial tycoons I've ever met.

She is gonna take our money and flip it into the market,

making us untouchable.

And Miss Rebecca Winfield,

she makes sure we don't get into trouble.


You all should know Cali, my partner.

If you can't get in touch with me,

call him.

He'll get with me.

Finally, Bug, our tech guy.

Without him,

there's no us.

Now my goal is to provide generational wealth.

You stay loyal to me,

your kids' kids shouldn't want for nothing.

I'm going to be the biggest female hustler

in the history of mankind.

But, there's one threat.

His name is Omar.

Princess.

Word is she built a new team.

But she's not even using the same algorhythm

Jason created.

Her tech is so advanced.

I can't even crack the mainframe.

Omar, what are we gonna do?

We move on to plan B.

What was plan A?

One that didn't end well.

So now we switch it up,

we get in her mind,

make it, make it seem like I'm giving in,

make it seem like I want to partner with her.

What are we at Diamond?

What?

Princess trusted you the most, right?

I mean, I guess.

But shit, don't none of that matter now.

She don't trust none of us.

But, if we make it seem like I turned on you too,

she wouldn't know what to expect.

Yeah, T that's what I'm gonna do.

I'm gonna have you go over to her,

act like you wanna join forces with her

for revenge towards me.

Then, we'll have an inside man.

I don't know, Omar.

That doesn't seem like a good idea.

What's up with you, huh?

Don't you want all us to win?

Of course I do.

You can't.

You always talking about,

"I don't know, Omar,"

or, "Maybe it don't seem right, Omar,"

or "It may not work, Omar."

Why can't you just be like,

"Let's go, Omar!"

or "Let's do it, Omar.

It's great idea, Omar."

You know what? Just sit there.

Don't say shit.

Have a coconut smile and shut the fuck up.

All right?

If you don't got any bright ideas to bring to the table,

I don't wanna hear nothing.

What?

What y'all scared of Princess now?

Y'all gonna act like some bitches?

That bitch shot at me.

I ain't going out like that.

This is the time that we unite.

Diamond,

I need you in this.

Okay, Omar.

I got you.

What do you want me to do?

You and Ace,

y'all go to Daeton.

Check out that new formula.

Jason's goin' to test it while you're all down there, okay?

Jason,

we need to get as much cash as possible,

if you're going to ride with me, okay?

Okay.

The mission here is to end whatever Princess thing

she got going on

by any means.

By any means,

we cannot let Omar get the upper hand.

Fam and Doe,

I need y'all to go back to the motel

and track his every move.

Anything for you, Princess.

Maria,

your flight leaves in a few hours.

Is there anything else you need from me?

Not that I can think of.

Oh, do you have that phone?

Oh yeah.

Untraceable, right?

Yes.

Okay.

I'll call you when I land.

(speaking in foreign language)

Rebecca,

I'm going to send Bug with you

to give you a little bit more insight on what we're doing

digitally so that you have a better understanding.

Okay? - Okay.

Come on, Bug.

Call me when you get the email, okay?

Okay.

All right, look.

Omar is a tricky motherfucker.

I don't need y'all getting caught up in his war.

It's already bad enough we lost Dae Dae.

It's because of Dae Dae we wanna ride for you, Princess.

I know that.

That's why I need y'all to distribute

this income and product.

I need brains now more than ever.

Y'all know how the streets move when it come to rock.

You're not going to have to worry about that.

[Doe] Yeah, we got that shit locked.

Even the white boys in upper Arlington?

Shit, they ain't fucking with us.

Plus we took the clientele last year.

It's a new year, Black.

Every day is a new year when it comes to this life.

The next hour isn't promised for any of us.

That's why I need you to set up the meeting

with the Arlington boys.

Bring them into what we got going on.

With all due respect Sis,

this shit ain't going to never work.

They ain't nothin' but stuck up, rich-ass white folks.

Shit.

Good thing I'm rich too.

All I see is green.

Set up the meeting, Black.

Let's do this in the name of Dae Dae.

Okay. - Okay.

Okay, let's go.

You set up that meeting now but,

we still want you there just in case.

[Princess] All right.

Let me know the time and place.

I will soon.

That didn't go bad at all.

Do you think everybody was receptive?

To me?

Yeah, we gotta wait and see.

Larue, you handle that problem from earlier?

Yeah, his body down in my cellar.

(phone chimes)

All right. They just landed.

All right, boys.

Let's go meet the new buyer.

(muffled bang)

Welcome, welcome.

You must be Princess.

I'm Nicko.

Cali's told me a lot about you.

Hello, Nicko.

Come with me, please.

(suspenseful music)

Princess, meet my colleagues, Amish and Amara.

They flew all the way in from India

to learn this information.

We have heard great things about you.

Which I hope to be true.

Well, I can show you better than I can tell you.

Nicko tells us that you have managed to scale your income

by 75% in the last six months.

And I hope to do the same for your business.

Did you bring the money?

Slow down, Princess.

You'll get your money.

Show us this algorithm.

You see, it's not that simple.

I have to-

Fraud!

I told you, Amish,

we should have never come here.

You wanted to listen to Nicko.

(speaking foreign language)

Hey!

I said it wasn't simple,

not impossible.

Larue, hand me the tablet.

This is how it works.

First, you're gonna go here and then

do this.

(piano music)

Princess, princess,

I must say I'm impressed.

Nicko, hand me over the briefcase.

Now remember,

this information is only valid for 90 days.

And then what?

We come back to you for more?

Well, of course.

And if we establish a solid network,

the initiatives are much greater.

[Amish] Thank you.

Pleasure doing business with you.

Until next time.

[Princess] Yes.

Princess, we'll be in touch.

â™ª Kingmatic

â™ª I'm in Cali young and smoking dope â™ª

â™ª We smokin' most all day

â™ª Mama said, boy, don't be in that trap â™ª

â™ª I die rich off a cell

â™ª You can come and get your pack â™ª

â™ª I see your bread

â™ª And we can mate

Hey, see this bitch-ass nigga right now?

What you want us to do with him?

[Princess] Follow him.

See where he go.

(phone line beeps)

Okay.

Love you too. Uh huh.

Later. Bye.

Bro, you are all cat.

What's up with you, hatin-ass man.

You going to get your time to shine, cuz.

Whatever, Nigga.

What'd she say?

She told us to follow him.

What do you think he's doing over there?

Who knows?

Probably something scandalous.

Cuz always up to no good.

He on the move.

(suspenseful music)


Fuck.

Got them back wheels, Cuz?

Yup.

Well, we might as well go to the moon,

fucking around with this, Nigga.

Fuck it. Why not?

(phone ringing)

Hello?

Who is this?

Drop the location.

Larue, take us to the Main Street bridge.

[Larue] Say less.

(engine revving)

Why am I not surprised?

I get it.

No one can be trusted.

I just don't know where else to go.

But why choose this route?

I know you're about your business

and you don't play when it come to revenge.

I just wanna hop in.

Omar will never get it.

He can't out-think me.

(screaming)

No!


Now it's really war.

Round up your best men.

I'll call you with the location.

Say less.


Shit, yo Fam.

Yo Fam, wake up.

What, man?

Yo, he gone.
