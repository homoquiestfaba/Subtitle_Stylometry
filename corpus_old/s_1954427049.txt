â™ª Carry on, my wayward son â™ª

â™ª there'll be peace
when you are done â™ª

â™ª lay your weary head to rest â™ª

Ohh!

â™ª Don't you cry no more â™ª

So, here we are, in Season 10.
That's right.

[ "Carry on Wayward Son"
resumes ]

What do you say we kill
some mutant sons of bitches

and we raise
a little hell?

Collins: I think there are
a lot of reasons

that "Supernatural" has lasted
as long as it has.

What is with you Winchesters,
huh?

We're in Season 10,

and we still care about
the Winchesters.

I had to look out for you.
That's my job.

I'd die for you,
I'd kill for you,

I'd go to the ends of the earth
for you.

It just comes back
to these two brothers.

I think
you're stuck with me.

Man: Rah!

Man: I'm really proud
of how this show

has been willing to be
subversive and play with form.

We landed in some dimension
where you're Jensen Ackles

and I'm something called
a Jared Padalecki.

We like to take risks.
Son of a bitch!

[ Laughter ]

Kind of liked the show.
Had its moments.

â™ª Carry on â™ª

A show that, on paper,
is so serious...

Help me!

...if we couldn't laugh at ourselves...
I'm Batman.

...I don't think
we'd have made it this far.

We got work to do.

â™ª Carry on, my wayward son â™ª
And we haven't hit the wall.

â™ª There'll be peace when you are done â™ª
there's really no end in sight.

Let's go.

â™ª Lay your weary head to rest â™ª
Dean!

I look forward
to what is gonna happen next.

â™ª Don't you cry no more â™ª
This is going to be so much fun.

Original Air Date on October 6, 2014

<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

Narrator: Then and now...

This was dad's single most
valuable possession.

...it's the story
of two brothers...

Everything he knows about
every evil thing is in here.

I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off --

you know, saving people,
hunting things --

the family business.

I set out
to make a horror show.

Man: Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!

Here's the deal, ladies --
something's not right.

So if you've heard
anything...

Well, it was like
two brothers

driving down the road
in a badass muscle car,

hunting things
that go bump in the night.

This one girl,

she got murdered out
on Centennial.

She hitchhikes,
and whoever picks her up --

well,
they disappear forever.

[ Woman screams ]

Narrator:
The early days of "Supernatural"

followed a simple
monster-of-the-week formula.

That has got to be the freakiest
damn scarecrow I've ever seen.

[ Gasps ]

Each week was the boys
driving into a new town...

Where are we?

We are just outside
of Grand Junction.

...hunting urban legends.

Bloody Mary,
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.

Kripke: And that was it.

It was as simple as that.

Let's hit the road.

[ Engine revs ]

Sam:
We still have options.

What options?
You got burial or cremation.

Narrator: Monsters were
the original focus,

but that quickly changed.

Come on, Sam,
a faith healer?

Maybe it's time to have
a little faith, Dean.

Faith was a turning point
in a lot of ways.

So, if you're not a believer,
then why are you here?

Apparently, my brother here

believes enough
for the both of us.

Pray with me, friends.

The audience saw the bond
that these brothers had...

[ Spectators murmuring ]
Dean!

...and that they were willing
to go above and beyond

to save one another.

Say something!

Kripke: It was about religion,
it was about fate,

it was deeply about Dean
as a character.

Woman: I guess,
if you're gonna have faith,

you can't just have it
when the miracles happen.

For all those reasons,

we realized the show
could be a lot more

than just a weekly monster show.

You know, I'm not much
of a praying type,

but I'm gonna pray for you.

Singer: We learned something
from that episode.

There's a miracle
right there.

And I think that sort of became
a little bit of a template

for what we could do.

Kripke:
The episodes start to become

more and more
about the brothers.

And I would say
the more that "Supernatural"

is about Sam and Dean,
the better it is.

Sam: When I told dad I was scared
of the thing in my closet,

he gave me a .45.
What was he supposed to do?

He was supposed to say,
"Don't be afraid of the dark."

Are you kidding me?!
Of course you should be afraid

of the dark.
You know what's out there.

Kripke: "Supernatural"
is a show about family,

and family is,
often at the same time,

your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

Narrator:
Sam is the kid brother.

Dad?

It's inside me.
I can feel it.

Loyalty drives
his every decision.

You shoot me in the heart, son!
Do it now!

Sammy!

For better or worse...

Aaaaah!

[ Gasps ]

Why didn't you kill it?

Killing this demon
comes first,

before me,
before everything.

No, sir,
not before everything.

...he's even given his life...

Sam, look out!

Ugh!
Narrator: ...Once or twice.

No!

Dean has always been
the protector.

I got you.
It's my job, right,

watch after my pain-in-the-ass
little brother?

To keep his brother safe...

Dean: Show your face,
you bitch!

...he would give anything...

Woman: Let me guess --
you're offering up your own soul?

All you got to do is
bring Sam back.

[ Gasps ]

[ Grunts ]

Sam: Did you
sell your soul for me?

Don't get mad at me.

Ackles:
And go to hell and back.

We've done that multiple times.

I had to look out for you.

That's my job.

And what do you think
<i>my</i> job is?

Go to the ends of the earth
for you --

well, we've had to do that
several times.

You're my big brother.

There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

It's two brothers
facing impossible odds

but always having the will
to find the possible.

The thing with "Supernatural" is

that you either care about
the Winchesters or you don't.

Their relationship
is still interesting to us,

and that's why we watch.

Dean, you conscious?

[ Woman moaning ]
Oh, God.

It was a beautiful,
natural act, Sam.

It's a part of you
I never wanted to see, Dean.

These two guys have
such a wonderful dynamic.

Jerk.
Bitch.

It's the kind of banter you would really
expect from brothers who grew up together.

You totally should have been
jamming "Eye of the Tiger" right there.

Oh, bite me.

That's really much of the reason

why the show has continued
for so long.

Both: You think
you're being funny,

but you're being
really, really childish.

Sam Winchester wears makeup.

Sam Winchester cries his way
through sex.

Sam Winchester keeps a ruler
by the bed,

and every morning,
when he wakes up...

Okay, enough!

You can have all the monsters

and werewolves
and ghosts and everything,

but if, at the end of the day,

you're not selling
that core relationship...

[ Laughing ] Yeah!

...as these two guys do,
then there is no show.

These are awesome.
Thanks.

Good.

Merry Christmas, bro.

[ Creature snarling ]

Kripke: I have, like, a list

of my favorite episodes
of "Supernatural,"

but the list that
I probably think about more

is the episodes
that I just hated.

[ Creature snarls ]
Aaah! Aah! Aaaah!

The top of the list is
one I wrote called "Wendigo."

Sam: Check that out.

There were no twists.
There were no turns.

It was just walking through the
woods and looking for a monster.

All right, everybody
stays together.

And we didn't have the money

to pull off
a really cool monster.

It was a bizarre kind of
a character in a latex costume,

and he catches on fire.

Hey!

If that sounds like that sucks,
it does,

and the episode did.

Narrator:
"Bugs" was not much better.

Aaaah!

Kripke: Bob Singer said...

Oh, god!

..."I beg you,
don't do this episode."

Bugs aren't scary.

They're just --
they're just not.

Sam: You know,
some beetles do eat meat.

I don't know.
Sounds like a stretch to me.

And I felt like, "We can do it!
It's gonna be great!"

It wasn't.

Kripke:
And then it turned into, like,

one laughably terrible scene
after another.

Aaah!

Narrator:
That is obviously fake,

but not all the bugs were.

Everybody in the house.
[ Electricity crackles ]

They told us, "We're gonna film
with these bees."

We're talking real live bees,
by the way.

[ Bees buzzing ]

Ackles: Well,
my favorite part about it

was talking with
the bee wrangler.

He's like...
[ Laughs ]

..."they're docile bees.

"So as long as you're not
aggressive towards them,

you should be okay."

Aah! Aah!

As soon as they yell "action,"
we're freaking out.

We're swatting.
I've got a full-on blowtorch.

They've got bees
in their shirts,

and they're
all getting stung to hell.

And then you looked
at the dailies,

and you couldn't see the bees,

so you saw a lot of people
going like this.

Oh!

They still had to CGI
extra bees in,

because they didn't show up
on film.

Aah!

Man, this sucks out loud.
Yeah, tell me about it.

John: Hey, Sammy.

Narrator: The mythology
of "Supernatural"

began simply enough.

Aah!

The first few seasons
of "Supernatural"

were Sam and Dean

chasing down the demon
that killed their mother.

[ Gunshot ]

[ Electricity crackles ]

That was for our mom,
you son of a bitch.

Then, the show took on a whole
other layer of complexity.

Sic him, boy.

Narrator: The simplest version
of the mythology

goes something like this.

Well, I mean, look,
Dean goes to hell...

Sam!

...Sam goes to hell...

Narrator:
The boys tangled with Lucifer.

...Dean goes to Purgatory...

Pan:
Every soul here is a monster.

...Sam goes to Purgatory...

This is adjacent.

...there was
a celestial holy war...

Angels. They're falling.

...both boys go to heaven...

Dean: If this is the Skymall,
it sucks.

I mean, where's the triplets
and the latex?

Come on,
a guy has needs.

...and Dean became a demon.

And there we are.

You make it sound
so easy.

Wishful thinking,
but maybe it's just the wind.

Kripke: Where, I think, the mythology
of the show really took off

was when we introduced Angels.

[ Glass shattering ]

Narrator:
It took until Season 4,

but when angels
finally showed up,

it was epic.

Kripke:
If I do so my damn self, like,

that is how you introduce
a character.

[ Gunfire ]

It was quite an introduction
to a show.

Who are you?
I'm the one who gripped you tight

and raised you
from perdition.

That is just some badass
badassery right there.

Narrator:
Castiel was an instant hit.

Still trying to figure out
who that is...

Yeah, who's the --
...And why he's even relevant.

What do you mean?

Misha -- lovely.

But Castiel? Never got it.
I've never understood it.

Narrator: Well, he's a hit
with fans anyway.

I think it's because
it's the cheapest costume

you can put together
if you're a fan.

In all seriousness,

Misha has brought "Supernatural"
to a whole nother level,

as we say in Texas.

The order comes

from high up on
the celestial chain of command.

How high?
Very.

There's a naivete
and an innocence to Cass.

[ <i>Woman moaning</i> ]
The pizza man truly loves this babysitter.

Why does he keep
slapping her rear?

Watching porn?

There's always a new incarnation
of my character.

Castiel has been crazy.

Castiel has been god.

He who lies in my name shall
choke on his own false tongue.

Castiel has been
a quasi-cult-leading,

drug-induced yoga instructor.

Why not go get washed up
for the orgy?

You're all so beautiful.

It's one of the things

that has made me enjoy
working on this show so much.

It's honey.
I collected it myself.

Narrator: And then...
You're off your rocker.

...there's Crowley.

Crowley:
Mr. Pendleton, I presume.

Narrator: Demons have been
a part of "Supernatural"

from day one...

The name's Crowley.

...but there is only one King.

I figured that Crowley would be

an interesting character
to play.

I mean, my opening scene
is kissing a 70-year-old man

at the crossroads.
[ Gasps ]

Damn you.

Enjoy the obscene wealth.

See you in 10 years.

Kripke:
When we originally wrote Crowley

as just King
of the crossroad demons,

I don't think we ever thought
that he would be around,

geez, six,
seven seasons later.

Dean: You show us yours,
and we'll show you ours.

Really, Dean,

I'm trying to conduct
a professional negotiation here,

and you want to talk
dangly bits.

If you were to sum up Crowley
in one word,

it would be "delicious."

So...to what do I owe
the reach-around?

He was the demon
you loved to hate,

but then you realized
you sort of loved to love,

'cause him being so horrible,

he's actually
incredibly enjoyable.

You seem even more constipated
than usual.

Maybe get you
some colon blow?

He says the most awful stuff.

Have you forgotten that that
you're the bottom in this relationship?

The pathology
of name-calling...

Where's your moose?

I don't need you to fight
my battles for me, moose.

Moose!

Still with the pork chops --
I admire that.

And then one of
the greatest moments,

which was Dean calling Crowley
on the phone,

it says, "not moose"...

Which just made me blow snot
out of my nose.

We just shared a foxhole,
you and I.

I really enjoyed when Sam
was turning Crowley human.

We beat back
the Tet offensive,

outran the --
the rape of Nanking together!

I just thought Mark Sheppard
was just brilliant in that performance.

Aaah!

Then I got to quote
some of my favorite HBO shows.

"Band of Brothers"?
"The Pacific"?

All those motels,

you never once watched HBO,
not once?

"Girls"?

It's really funny.

You're my Marnie, moose.
A-and Hannah --

she just --
she needs to be loved.

And very sad, I think --
sad and touching.

We deserve to be loved.
I deserve to be loved!

It's a great job I've got.

I just want to be loved.

He just brings
so much je Ne sais quoi

to his King of hell.

We love him.

Narrator: "Supernatural" was
born as a horror series.

And though it grew
to become so much more,

it has never lost the ability
to scare and shock.

Kripke: One of the creepiest

that immediately
jumps in mind for me...

Come on, hold still.

...is "The Kids Are Alright."

[ Gasps ]

What's wrong, mommy?

There's these demon children

and that you have
this kind of harried mother.

Her children are endlessly
devouring her energy.

[ Snarls ]

Scary kids
are even more scary.

[ Laughs ]

It's okay
when they're full-grown,

but the little guys are --
that's -- mnh-mnh.

[ Clatter ]

"The Benders,"
I though was scary.

What are they?
See for yourself.

Padalecki: What was gonna be
a demon or a ghost

or a zombie or a ghoul
or a vampire or a werewolf...

[ Metal clanks ]

...then it turned out
to be humans.

[ Grunting ]
You want to play games?

This is something I probably
shouldn't be talking about publicly,

but I get really scared
by, like, horror movies.

Dean!
Ugh!

Collins: And when I would watch

like two or more episodes of
"Supernatural" consecutively...

[ Roars ]

...I would have nightmares.

[ Gasps ]

Aaaaaaaaah!

Man: Cut!

It's all good, Tara.

That was great.

Narrator: What nobody
could have expected is...

from time to time,

"Supernatural" is one of
the best comedies on television.

Uh, maybe we try dialing up
that scream, huh?

"Hollywood Babylon,"
which was, like, our first stab

at, like,
a really funny episode...

[ Weakly ] Aah!

Aaaaaaaah!

Now, <i>that's</i>
what I'm talking about!

Gary Cole plays
this studio executive.

Cut!

We were just wondering
if it could be,

you know,
a little brighter.

Brad, this is a horror movie.
Who says horror has to be dark?

Every single note he gives

is word for word a real note
we got from the CW.

The rules aren't
really landing for me.

If the ghosts are in hell,
how do they hear the chanting?

I mean [Chuckles] what do
they have, super hearing?

All he does is give notes...

I don't understand.
If they were in hell,

how could they hear
our chanting?

They must have
super hearing.

...[chuckling]
Until he's murdered.

[ Crash ]

Aaaaaah!

You don't remember
any of this?

Remember what?

This -- today.

Like -- like -- like
it's...happened before?

Narrator: In "Mystery Spot,"

Sam relives one day
over and over...

Like "Groundhog Day"?
Yes, exactly.  Like "Groundhog Day."

...a day that always ends
with Dean's death.

[ Gunshot ]
Ugh!

[ Up-tempo rock 'n' roll plays ]

Rise and shine, Sammy!

Kripke: All the different ways
that we got to kill him

was endlessly entertaining
to us.

[ Barking ]
Somebody need a friend?

[ Dog snarling ]
Good boy. Aah!

[ Up-tempo rock 'n' roll plays ]
Ugh!

[ Electricity crackling ]

Of those,
my single favorite was,

he takes a bite of a taco
and he says...

These tacos
taste funny to you?

[ Up-tempo rock 'n' roll plays ]
Out of all the deaths anywhere,

the death of taco botulism is,
um, is my favorite.

My God, you're a freak.

Ugh!

[ Tires screech ]

I thought "Yellow Fever"

was a good comedic episode
for me personally.

Narrator: In "Yellow Fever,"

Dean becomes infected
by a virus that causes fear.

[ Cat yowls ]
Aaaaaaaah!

Hilarious fear.
That was scary!

Ackles: Dean is such this
kind of machismo guy's guy.

Puts up the big wall of "I'm not
afraid of anything," kind of,

and then now he's just
a little scared princess.

Man: It's Marie
you got to look out for.

She smells fear.

[ Snake hissing ]
[ Inhales sharply ]

I lost my underpants when
that snake came over the couch.

You were, like,
at least 3 feet away.

This ain't about Sam Winchester
being scared.

It's about Dean.
I'm leaving.

Is that a rabbit's foot?

In a show that, on paper,
is so serious...

Man: It's not a luck charm.
It's a curse.

...to be able to be irreverent,
having fun...

Oh, geez!

...I think,
has kept us going.

What?
I lost my shoe.

[ Scoffs ]

Dean: Hey, don't forget
the extra onions this time, huh?

Dude, I'm the one who's gonna
have to ride in the car

with your extra onions.

Narrator:
It's true that "Supernatural"

lives and dies
with Sam and Dean Winchester.

Hey, see if they got
any pie.

Bring me some pie!

But there have been
a few other characters...

Welcome to my blue heaven.

Narrator: ...That we've also
loved over the years.

Awesome. The king of hell just
snapped my girlfriend's neck.

How about you?

Narrator:
Actually, quite a few.

You've been garthed.

Just tell me who you are.

Narrator:
Some weren't even human.

You're a demon.
Don't be such a racist.

I think all our demons
have been great.

Come on, Sam!
I'm awesome!

But if I had to pick a favorite,
I would go with the yellow-eyed demon.

That dear old mom of yours,
that adorable little sister...

At one point, he says...

I'll make certain
that they both live long enough

to know the chewy taste
of their own intestines.

And he nails the line!
He just sticks it!

Like I say, genius.

Personally, I really like Meg.

Keep talking dirty.
It makes my meatsuit all dewy.

All right, simmer down.

I just thought she was cool.

Collins:
What about her was good?

She was a good kisser.

What was that?

I learned that
from the pizza man.

There are so many good demons.

Morning, sunshines.

Sheppard:
Abaddon was just extraordinary

with the slashed throat
and "The devil made me do it."

I am your king.

About that...

Aah!

It was fantastic to watch.

[ Knock on door ]
Man: Got a minute?

Dean: You're an angel,
aren't you?

That's all I need
is another one of you guys.

Narrator:
When it comes to angels...

"Supernatural" has an original take.
[ Drill whirring ]

We're gonna do angels,
but the angels are gonna be dicks.

Quit hurling feces
like a howler monkey.

Maybe I should rip out
your sticky bits.

Let me guess.

You two mutton heads
broke the world,

and you want me
to sweep up your mess.

Angels? Can't stand angels.
Dreadful.

You sons of bitches
jump-started Judgment Day.

Maybe we let it happen.
We didn't start anything.

Other than Cass,
who's my favorite angel?

Ohh. I don't know.

I mean, it's really --
it's really tough,

'cause my mind
is just overshadowed

by how great Cass is.

Sorry if it's a bit chilly.

Most people think I burn hot.

It's actually
quite the opposite.

Lucifer was a pretty good angel,
you know, if you think about it.

Lucifer, you're my brother
and I love you,

but you are
a great big bag of dicks.

Watch your tone.

Bobby: I'll tell you
something else, too.

This is some serious crap
you boys stepped in.

Narrator:
Perhaps no non-Winchester

was as popular as Sam
and Dean's surrogate dad --

Bobby Singer.

Are you under the impression

that family is supposed to make
you feel good?

Make you an apple pie,
maybe?

They're supposed
to make you miserable!

That's why they're family!

Ackles:
He was the father figure,

he was the patriarch,

he was the oracle,
he was the Yoda,

he was home to these guys.

You want to go hunting?
I'll hunt it.

I'll kill anything.

Aww, he's adorable.

[ Both laugh ]

His original name
was Bobby Manners,

but then legal comes back
and they say we can't do it

for legal reasons.

"Then, all right, I'm just gonna
call him Bobby Singer."

Narrator: The real Bob Singer
was not that into it.

I go, "Yeah, I'm really
not crazy about this."

He's like,
"what the hell are you doing?

"Like, everyone
is going to think

I named the character
after myself."

With the right name,
the right ritual,

ain't nothing
you can't suss out.

If I'd known that he was gonna
go on and be the character that he was,

I probably would have put
my foot down a little more.

Here's to...running into
you guys on the other side.

Only...not too soon.

All right?

[ Engine revs ]

Whoo!
Listen to her purr.

You ever heard
anything so sweet?

Narrator: The longest-running
supporting player

isn't any kind
of sentient being.

Sam: You know, if you two want
to get a room, just let me know, Dean.

Oh, don't listen
to him, baby.

[ Engine revs ]
He doesn't understand us.

The iconic '67 Impala --

it was almost
something else entirely.

When I came up with
"Supernatural,"

it was really important to me

to, like, come up with, like,
a really distinctive car.

My neighbor pimps rides
for a living.

I'm like, "oh, hey, man,
I've been wanting to ask you.

Like, I need, like, a really
badass car for this show."

I'm thinking, "the '68 Mustang.
Like, that'd be cool."

And, uh, and he's like,
"Yeah, yeah,

that would be totally cool
if you're a [Bleep]"

327 four-barrel,
275 horses.

A little TLC,
this thing is cherry.

We have the modern show

that everyone associates
with a cool car.

[ Tires screech ]
Whoo-hoo!

And that's awesome.

Hello.

I am Harry Spangler.

And I am Ed Zeddmore.

â™ª Ghost, Ghostfacers â™ª

Narrator: "Supernatural"
has never been afraid

to turn itself on its head.

Oh!
Kripke: We were sort of the kids

in the back of the class
at the CW,

and we were the ones
throwing spitballs.

Narrator:
It's been reality TV.

A-aren't those [Bleep]
from Texas?!

Holy [Bleep]

It's been
a classic monster movie.

Dean: The hero gets the girl,
monster gets the gank.

All in all, happy ending.

[ Soft pop music plays ]

It's pushed
the boundaries of form

like few other series ever have.

Kripke: My favorite episode
of "Supernatural," period,

was "Changing Channels."

Hey, there, Sam.
What's happening?

Oh, nothing.
Um, just the end of the world.

[ Laughter and applause ]

Narrator:
In "Changing Channels,"

Sam and Dean are trapped by the
Trickster inside a TV universe.

Hijinks ensue.

Oh, Dean.

Son of a bitch.

That send-up we did
on "Gray's Anatomy" --

I mean, I watch it today,
I laugh.

Doctor.
Ow!

Seriously.

What?
Seriously?

There was
the Japanese game show.

[ Buzzer ]
Aw!

I'm sorry,
Sam Winchester.

Sorry?

Sorry for what?

Ohhh!

I mean, who doesn't love, like,
just a good hit in the nuts?

Whoa!

"Nut-cracker"!

[ Groaning ]

Sam became K.I.T.T.
From "Knight Rider,"

and Dean is rooting around
in his trunk.

<i>Dean?</i>
What?

That, uh, feels
really uncomfortable.

Ow.

Like, that still makes me laugh.

Run!
[ Glass shatters ]

Narrator: With a penchant
for wild experiments...

Man: Cut!
[ Cheers and applause ]

Narrator: ...It was only
a matter of time...

Real good, solid fall.
Way to go.

...before the fourth wall
came tumbling down.

"Supernatural,"
tail slate, marker!

"The French Mistake" is
my all-time favorite episode.

That's a wrap
on Jared and Jensen!

W-who the hell are --

Jared!
Three minutes, okay?

Sheer recklessness of, like,
what a show is willing to do.

Trish Evian here

with Jared Padalecki
from TV's "Supernatural."

Sheppard: So, it's just
wonderfully surreal.

I was actually quite jealous
that I wasn't in it.

They put
freakin' makeup on us.

Those bastards.

Padalecki: I remember,
we got a phone call saying,

"do you guys mind
playing yourselves?"

And it was like the record
stopped, you know?

Don't look at the camera.
What?

Look anywhere
but the camera.

Cut!

[ Bell rings ]

Look, you can throw
Sam and Dean

in any kind of wacky universe
you want.

Nice modest digs,
Jay-Z.

As long as I'm never breaking
out of my character, Dean...

Yeah.
...Then that's fine.

Dude, you have a camel
in your backyard.

It's an Alpaca, dumbass.

Ruby?

You <i>married</i> fake Ruby?

He still has all those portraits
of himself in his house.

Oh, yeah.
[ Laughs ]

But it was a lot of fun
to poke fun at ourselves.

Misha?

Oh, wow.

Misha? Jensen?

What's up with the names
around here?

When I got the script,

I called the writers,
and I said,

"Hey, could you make
my character

as much of a douche
as possible?"

Man: Action.

Good night, Misha.
Good night, little fella.

I'm probably gonna Tweet this.

"Hola, mishamigos."

Narrator: Even the producers
didn't escape unscathed.

Eric, thanks for coming.
Bob! Of course.

And, I mean, shooting Kripke
in the end... [chuckles]

Hey, extra!
Over here!

And we were like,
"are we insane?

Have we gone too far?"

[ Western music plays ]

And we were like,
"that's just too awesome.

We have to do that."

Collins: To my knowledge,

no other show has done
anything quite so strange,

and I think that that's
one of the big reasons

that the fans have stuck around,

is that it's taken
these risks

in doing things
that other shows aren't doing.

Don't like this universe,
Sammy.

We need to get out
of this universe.

Yeah, no argument here.

[ Laughing ]

Hey Dean,
looking good.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Dean, too. Duh.

Maybe this is
getting out of hand. Nah!

From the conversations that
I've had with a lot of fans,

it's a lot more
than entertainment.

I deserve to be loved!

There is no "Supernatural"
without its fans.

We know that.

Creativity of the fans
is really astounding to me.

Dean!

Collins: It's amazing,
the amount of artistry

that goes into
"Supernatural" fandom.

Hi, y'all. I'm Bobby.

Fans go to so much effort

to make things for us
or show us what they feel.

There is a wooden chess set.

All the figures

are just painstakingly carved
out of wood.

I've probably seen
two dozen Impalas

that look just like the Impala
that the boys have driven.

I'm very wary of people
that aren't fans of something.

I mean, it's kind of weird not
to freak out over cool things.

I'm about to watch the Season 9
finale of "Supernatural."

Crowley:
<i>Listen to me, Dean Winchester.</i>

Sheppard: There's a wonderful
set of videos online

of people watching that.

What you're feeling right now
is not death.

It's life.

[ Voice breaking ]
He's gonna be fine.

Crowley:
Open your eyes, Dean.

See what I see.

Feel what I feel.

No! No. No.

Let's go take a howl
at that Moon.

[ Gasps ] No, no, no!

[ Gasps ]

Oh, my God!
Aaaah! Aaah!

Aaaaaah!

Did you see his eyes?!

Sheppard:
The show has an impact.

It's kind of humbling
in a lot of ways

to see the impact that it has.

We put our heart and soul
into it,

and they've returned
the favor.

I'm gonna go cry some more.

You guys are larping, aren't you?
Excuse me.

Narrator: Inspired by
their passionate fans...

You're fans.
Fans of what?

..."Supernatural" has gone

where other shows
would never dare.

"Supernatural."

Two guys hunt down ghosts,
demons, vampires.

What are their names?
Uh...

Sam and Dean?
That's it.

We started to get really meta
with the books.

Give me that.

The Chuck Shurley story line --

probably one of my very favorite
things about the show.

"Sam and Dean approached
the ramshackle house..."

[ Doorbell rings ]

Carver: The idea of

this whole set of books
written by him

and the idea that
he could be something else.

Obviously, I'm a god.
You're not a god.

I write things,
and then they come to life?

Yeah,
now I'm definitely a god.

I was in love
with the show before that,

but I was ready to marry
the show after that.

Did you really have to live
through the bugs?

Yeah.

I am...so sorry.

I mean,
horror is one thing,

but to be forced to live
bad writing.

Singer: You know,
our meta episodes --

you know, turning it back
on ourselves --

really comes from the fans.

You know, they're so invested.

They're gonna want
to see it.

See what? See what?

Oh, my God.

I love it when they talk
at the same time!

Singer:
It was an easy leap, then,

to go to, "well,
let's have a convention."

Becky, what is this?

It's awesome!

Padalecki:
Can't think of another show

that could possibly
get away with it.

It's like a symbiosis,
where we exist because of them

and they exist as fans
because of the show.

Man: I don't think the Benders

made flesh suits
out of all their victims.

It was, like, a couple scarves.

And so they're really nice
opportunities to say, like,

"hey, guys, we're doing a show
about y'all."

Yeah, a nice wink to the fans.
Yeah.

[ "Carry on Wayward Son" plays ]

So, what happens next?

Narrator: As "Supernatural"
begins a remarkable 10th season,

it's fair to ask,

"how has the show made it
this far,

and what keeps it going?"

The rules are simple.

Family don't end
with blood, boy.

It's something personal
and relatable

that everybody
can identify with.

But at the same time,

they bring in these epic
mythology story lines...

Oh, hello, death.

We're dealing with
life and death and dreams,

imagination,
and the future and the past.

Man, I had a weird dream.

Yeah?
Clowns or midgets?

I think the longevity
is really based

on that we try to be original...

Hey, there, handsome.
Shut up!

...try to come up
with something new.

â™ª Carry on, my wayward son â™ª

That was kind of creepy,
right?

But ultimately just comes back
to these two brothers.

I don't know whether to give you
a hug or take a shower.

And that has just continued
to breathe life into the show.

â™ª Don't you cry no more â™ª

Because they're fighting for humanity
and they're fighting for each other.

Ackles: It's really kind of brought
this network of people together.

And they fight for us, and as
long as they continue to do that,

we'll do the best by them.

Narrator: Nine seasons so far,

but it's not over yet,
my friends.

What happened with you
being okay with this?

I lied.

Narrator: There's still
plenty of road ahead.

More to come -- Season 10.

My word -- there's more to come
in Season 10.

As long as everyone
is still willing,

I think we've got many,
many years to go.

So, what do we do now?

We make our own future.
