New algorithm should increase uptime
by at least to 20% .

Let's hope that's enough.
We need to catch a break here.

Today's the day, sir. l can feel it.
All systems are go.

Excellent.

Proceed to Phase Two.

lnitiating dispersal protocol now.

Releasing the drones.

They're in the air.
First databurst coming in three... two...

. . .one.

Piping the datastreams
into Little Blue.

Starting the predictive model.

All right, she's all yours.

All right, we are live.

How's it looking on your end, Major?

Looks good.

Transmission is clean.

Statistical accuracy at 42%

44...

Now 48 percent.

Looks like we have a constant
rising target, Major.

Tracking.

Do you see it?

About 3,000 meters, about 10:00.
18 degrees east.

52% .

Let's switch it over.

Hold on.

Now at 55% .

Drones are down 30% .

We'll start to get a drop in data
transmission in 30 seconds.

Just hold on.

57% .
Stabilizing at target levels, Major.

We're running out of time.
Let's do this, people.

Yes.
Switching to lateral controls now.

We have acceleration, Major.

We're measuring
a wind-speed increase of 1 1 % , sir.

1 1 % . Outstanding.

Let's fly this plane.

Affirmative.
Ready to proceed to the next phase.

Acceleration is increasing.

Velocity up 18%

18% ?

That's significantly higher than the model.
Do we have a problem, Doctor?

Cannot confirm at this time, Major.

We're now at 23% .

Ground speed 735 miles per hour.

You're exceeding the structural
limitations of the plane.

Shut it down.

Negative response.

We're still accelerating.

Danger! Danger!
lntegrity of the jet stream is compromised.

Danger! Danger! Danger!
lt's diving. Get back to your seats.

Danger! Danger! Danger!
Lock in!

Danger! Danger! Danger!

Break out of the stream.
lnitiate shut-down protocols now.

We need more power to break out of this.
Maxed out on throttle.

Danger! Danger! Danger!

Lost contact, sir.
l need the abort code.

Hang on. Let's see
if they can break out of this.

The jet stream's been diverted.

Diverted where?
West coast, sir.

Just north of San Francisco.

Abort code Tango-Delta.

Transmitting.

Surf's up in California.

No, actually, l am a scientist.
l was going to be a scientist.

l was going to go further with that,
but now here l am, l'm a weatherman.

Okay, more energy, more energy.

l'm Steve ''Sunny'' Simpson.

When you're looking for the guy
that knows Seattle's weather,

l'm the weather. . .

lt's Angel.

This is forward, right?
Okay, let's try it again.

But this thing's not knocking
on our door yet.

lt's way out in the scab lands.

Does-does anybody even know
where the scab lands are?

Are they east? West?

Oh, they're east, okay.

Um... going again?

What? We're live?

Normal high in the Seattle
area this year...

So, it looks like another Steve
''Sunny'' Simpson week.

Kilometers? Are we...

...are we doing the Canadian version
or the American version?

Here we go.

Have winds gusting up into 60 kilometers
per hour just about midnight.

On the way.
We'll talk about that in the Mormon.

ln the moment.
ln a moment! ln a moment!

Good morning, Seattle. Take a deep breath.
The air is fresh and clean,

thanks to the freak thunderstorms that
have been hitting us all week.

The weather guy swears to me
we've got nothing but blue sky ahead of us.

That doesn't go for the Seattle
Thunderbirds, of course.

They're 0 and 1 4 and looking
for a way into the record books.

lf you ask me we can do it.
Let's see if we can't make this...

There you go.
Just sent you my analysis.

Excellent.
We look forward to reviewing it.

Okay, so listen, Mr. or Ms. Anonymous
whoever you are,

this armchair analyst thing you have
me doing here, it's falling short.

We really need
some on-the-ground observations.

What are you proposing?

Well, it looks to me like one of these
anomalies is forming kind of close to here.

How can you tell?

l don't know, l can just... tell.
Call it a hunch.

Anyway, here's an idea.
How about we go out there together,

we make some observations,
and we finally meet?

That's not recommended.
Hey, honey?

What do you mean, ''not recommended?''
There's no substitute for direct observation.

Plus, l think l deserve to know
who l've been dealing with.

We strongly advise
you stay clear of that area.

Honey?
Why? What's the issue?

Why won't you just. . .

Oh, my. . .

Hello? Over here? Your fiance?

Oh, l'm sorry, baby. Come here.
Here, come here.

Come here.

Who were you just talking to?

l wish l knew.
lt's this same anonymous caller.

They keep feeding me data
and asking me questions.

Really?
You expect me to believe that?

Why would they be feeding you data?

l don't know, l guess they,
um, value my input.

And who might they be?

Like l keep telling you, baby,
l have no idea.

lt's probably some climate research team
that's stuck and they need some insight.

From you? A research team?

What do you mean, ''from me?''
Nothing.

Oh...

you mean from a guy who got kicked out
of his doctoral program for plagiarism.

Okay, l didn't say that
so stop being so sensitive.

Okay.

Besides, l thought they called it cheating.

Yeah, same thing.
l get it okay.

Okay plagiarism.

Okay, stop.

Look. . . you know l'll stand by
you no matter what. . .

. . .but you just, you've got
a great opportunity here.

As the KPQR weatherman?

Yeah.

Steve, you've got to
let go of the past,

okay? You've got a new job ahead of you
and rocking the boat like this is risky.

l'm not rocking the boat.

l've been tracking these weird
patterns for months now.

My predictive algorithms show
that they're going to spike.

l just... l wish you could forget all this
and focus on your job.

My job is to predict the weather, Ange!
No, that is a scientist's job!

And that didn't pan out,
which, you know, is fine by me.

But your job is to. . .

you know, deliver your lines, and look cute,
and be funny, and you're great at that.

Jack knows it, too. He's grooming you. . .
Jack, please.

Speak of the devil.
Please, think about it. For me.

l have. This is Steve!

Steve? Come on, buddy,
where's the nickname we worked out?

Steve ''Sunny'' Simpson, weather guy.
Friendly, easy on the eye.

Right? With me?

Sunny. Sunny Simpson.
Yeah, sure. You know,

we don't want to alienate the average Joe.
Alienate? God forbid!

We are entertainers, sonny boy.
Hold on a sec.

What the hell is this?
Get him in here.

That's what l love about this job.

Entertainment opens up opportunities
to inspire,

to educate to make a difference
in the world.

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell are you talking about?

This is about ratings.

l don't know what difference
you're planning on making,

but this is all about ratings.

So let's see
if we can't give them a boost huh?

Lighten up,
bring some levity to the game.

My bottom line goes down when their
bottom line goes down, you got that?

Uh...
Go, go, go!

Gee, l can do that, Jack, you know.
l can l can do some light banter, and,

you know, we can have a little
more fun with it. That's cool.

Maybe try some where
you wear different outfits, you know?

Like reflecting the weather.

So if it's snow, like, wear a big coat.

lf it's rain, maybe a rain hat.

lf it's a sunny day...
What?

...maybe a colored shirt.

Wow, Jack, you know what, man?
That's really original.

Let's try injecting some sex appeal.
How about a speedo?

A speedo?

Are you serious?

Serious as a heart attack.

Yeah, you know what, Jack, um,
l don't think that's going to play too well.

Aw, come on, Sunny,
get with the program.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hold on.

l got another brainstorm.

Weatherman gone wild.

Weatherman gone wild?

Yeah, you know, like ''Girls Gone Wild,''
Teens Gone Wild? Weatherman Gone Wild.

Weather's gone crazy,
so has the weatherman.

Weatherman Gone Wild! Think about it.
lt's got YouTube virality written all over it.

Weatherman Gone Wild!

l want you to think about it Come on,
say it back to me, Steve. Say it back to me.

Smile!
Weatherman Gone Wild.

There you go. Say it again.

You know what this is really interesting,
but l got something l've got to talk to you about.

Just say it back to me, come on.
Weatherman Gone Wild.

Weatherman Gone Wild, okay?
l'm gonna think about it, but listen. . .

. . .l've got this huge scoop.
lt's an unbelievable story.

What like a weather scoop?

Yeah. All l need is a camera crew
and a field truck.

Who do you think you are?
Tom Brokaw?

l'll give you a van and a cameraman.
What are you going to give me, weatherman?

Jack l am going to give you footage
you have never seen before.

That's what l love about you,
sonny boy, you get it.

What are we talking about here?
Give me the pitch.

Okay, check it out, Jack.

There is going to be a convergence
in the jet stream that's going to cause this...

...huge weather anomaly.
lt's going to be out of this world.

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the hell are
you talking about?

Um...

l'm talking about, uh, l'm talking about
Weatherman Gone Wild!

Yeah.
lt's gonna be off the charts.

Richter. Weatherman Gone Wild, l'm all in.
Now you're talking.

Save all the cerebral nonsense
for the Discovery Channel.

l want ratings.
l want Weatherman Gone Wild!

Yeah, l hear you, brother. Okay, cool.
Weatherman Gone Wild, l got it.

Over and out.

That guy is out of his mind.

Promise me something?

Sure, anything, baby.

No more anonymous calls, okay?
Just it doesn't feel right that.

l have no idea who's calling me!
Okay. . . whatever.

Just no more, all right?

Okay.

l love you.
Love you.

Weatherman gone wild.
Whoo! Yeah, baby.

The new Weatherman Gone Wild.
Bye.

You better look out
when you get home tonight.

Bye!

No signal.

So how'd you get
into this racket anyway, Louie?

News cameraman.
How did you get into it?

Did you always want
to be a cameraman?

Did you play with the cameras as a kid?
You know, stuff like that?

You gotta pay the bills.

Keeps the ball and chain happy.

Right. You mean the wife.

The wife.

lt's happening.

lt's gonna be. . .
You know, l was born in Budapest, Hungary.

Went to the same film school
with Vilmos Zsigmond.

Wilmore Zigmund?

Vilmos Zsigmond,
the great cinematographer.

He shot movies for Steven Spielberg.

Spielberg? Really?

Yeah, and l shoot
the KPQR Morning News.

l hear you, man. Life's a bitch, huh?

And then you die.

Yeah.
Are you sure there's a story here?

Not much to look at.
Louie,

see those cirrocumulus clouds
right there?

That's what l want you to focus on.

Well, l thought it was something
more to do with Weatherman Gone Wild.

l'm not sure Jack
was thinking about this.

l don't care what Jack's thinking about.
This is a huge scoop, Louie.

The jet stream's not supposed to change.
lt's a constant.

lt's like gravity got shut off
in the middle of the night.

So no girls in bikinis, huh?

Just roll the camera.
The clouds are perfect right now.

Ah, perfect, you say.

Nobody's ever seen anything like this.
Okay.

How about you just indulge me
a little bit?

l'll indulge you all you want,
just don't forget that

this is supposed to be a live broadcast.

Live?

Yeah. They wanted us to do it live.

l thought we were just getting
some B-roll.

Now...

. . .are you ready with your. . .

. . .your stand-up
Weatherman Gone Wild?

lt's a story about climate change,
the jet stream changing course.

l don't want to rain
on your parade, but...

this is not PBS.
Yeah, l hear you.

Now, Steve, just relax.
Okay.

Play on the fact that you're on a live shoot
and nothing's happening.

Trust me, this won't be first time.

Really? Thanks, Louie.

No problem, kid.

You going to stand there?

Yeah.
Just don't forget to pan up to the sky.

Yeah, got it. Here we go.

Five. . .

Four...

Three. . .

Boy, l wouldn't want to be
in their shoes!

Speaking of hot and wild,

here's our own Steve Sunny Simpson,

the Weatherman Gone Wild
with an incredible story.

Sunny, what do you have for us?

How's it going back there?

Fine, Steve, the question is,
how's it going there?

Right!

Well, what if l told you that,
in the middle of the night,

gravity got shut off?
What?

That's exactly what l said.
l want you to take a look at this.

That's a classic cirrocumulus cloud.

They exist between 25,000
to 40,000 feet in the jet stream.

But notice how it's shredded?

What l'm saying is that the jet stream as...
What the hell kind of scoop is this?

we have known it
has changed fundamentally.

That's fascinating, Sunny.
So what are we looking at in our future?

l mean, in terms of weather.

lt's kind of hard to tell from here, but...

What is that?

What do you expect us
to tell the President, Major?

Have you lost control of Thor's Hammer?
Lost control?

What you're looking
at is proof of concept.

Thor's Hammer is going to be one of the
most powerful weapons systems ever created.

This is not going to get developed
without some degree of collateral damage.

l'm not exactly sure
what your expectations are.

We expect the collateral damage
to remain below acceptable levels.

You give me the eggs,
l'll make the omelette.

Proceed, Major.

Yes, ma'am.
Wouldn't have it any other way.

Hold on, Louie! Hold on!
Hold on!

Hold on, Louie!
Stay with me! Louie!

He's awake!

Hey, Daisy.
Looking pretty cute today.

Uh, hey, folks.
The jet stream's moving a lot. . .

. . .these days, and it's, uh, really sort of
traveling in a direction here. . .

. . .and it's spawning these little spinning
depressive things

that's hovering right above our heads.

Hey, baby.

Hey!

Big day.
You ready to go home?

Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

Watching your favorite show?

Yeah.

To the north and into the east,
bringing a lot of punch.

Wear that raincoat out there.

They all got it wrong.

Don't worry about them, okay?

Jack called.

They've got a whole
new show planned for you.

Tornado Man.

What?

Baby, Tornado Man!

This is going to get you
on the anchor track.

That was no tornado, Ange.

You don't know
what you're talking about.

You're a celebrity now.

A celeb. . . What are you talking about?
You're Tornado Man!

Okay, you have to see this video.

You're probably the only person
who's not seen this.

Almost two million views!

Notice how it's shredded.

What l am saying is that the jet stream
as we have known it

has changed, fundamentally.

That's fascinating, Sunny.
So, what are we looking at in our future?

l mean in terms of weather?

lt-it's kind of hard to tell from here,
but...

What is that?

Louie!

Louie, hold on. . .

lsn't that amazing?

lt has almost two million views.

Okay, and wait until you see this.

You're even on a t-shirt.

You know what, Ange, l mean,
that's great. Yeah, a million views.

But Louie is dead. l...

How do you think this makes me feel?

Yeah, it's... l know.
l took him out there.

He was my responsibility.
Baby, it was an accident.

No. No it wasn't, Ange.

Listen to me.

l got a call from those anonymous people,
and they warned me not to go out there. . .

. . .but l went out there anyway.

Do you hear what l'm saying?
They told me not to go!

Steve... l've stood by you for two years,
helping you rebuild your life.

And suddenly, this great opportunity
has come along, and...

Look, l feel bad for Louie and his family,
too, believe me, l do, but...

no matter what you do now,

there's no bringing him back.

Will you just think about it?

l'm going to go and handle
your release papers, okay?

All right.

lt's-it's kind of hard to tell from here
but. . .

What is that?

What is that?

That's fascinating, Sunny.
So, what are we looking at in our future?

l mean, in terms of weather?

lt-it's kind of hard to tell from here,
but. . .

What is that. . .

Hello.

Hey, yo, yo, yo, is this Tornado Man?
Do l have the honor?

Uh, hey, Jack.

How's it all coming together, buddy?
l understand you're almost on your feet.

So, when can l expect you back?
l want Tornado Man on the air!

Yeah, you know, l'm not sure
l want to be back on the air.

Whoa.
What the hell are you talking about?

You know,
with Louie and everything, l just,

l don't know if l want to be
a weatherman anymore, Jack.

Steve...

listen to me, buddy.

Bad things happen to good people.

Now, you want to spend your life moping
or you want to move on?

l just... l don't know if l can get. . .
Listen to me.

You've got a bright future.
You've got to weather these things.

You understand what l'm saying?
Yeah. Yeah.

So, when can l expect you back?

When's Tornado Man coming back?

Jack, listen, l just need some time, man.
l can't commit right now.

Okay, Steve, be straight with me.

Are you fielding other offers right now?
lf so who are you talking to?

lt's not like that Jack, all right?
l gotta go.

Wait, hold on a sec. Hang on a sec. . .
l got another call.

Damn.

lt's gotta be CNN.

Oh, man.

We're relieved to hear you
survived the incident.

Yeah? Who is ''we'' exactly?

That information cannot be
disclosed at this time.

What do you people want from me?

Access to the data figures to predict the
location of the event.

You know what data l used.

What model did you use
to make the prediction?

You want answers from me?

You're going to have
to answer my questions.

Sounds to me like you
guys opened Pandora's Box

and let out something
you can't control.

Why don't you guys just tell me
who this is?

We are asking the questions.
No. . . l'm asking the questions!

l went out there!
l got someone killed!

l want some answers!

You were warned.
You did not heed our warning.

This conversation's over.

Oh, boy, the bloody schedule is shot.

There's half a dozen lorries
behind this one, come on!

Get a bloody move on!

You what?

Say what?

What did you say to me, boy?

Well, thank you.

Thank you.

You're all right you are.

Fish?

ln London a freak weather condition
caused fish to rain from the sky.

They're estimating nearly 100,000 fish
came down in the space of just a few minutes.

Experts say, a cyclone in the Atlantic
was responsible

for what many are taking to be

a biblical sign of the end of days.
Where we come from. . .

. . .there's a legend, prophecy,
that say. . .

. . .that when a man challenge God...

. . .he is purged. . .

Hey!

ls this how you're planning
on spending your day again?

What?

ln front of the computer
with the TV on, like. . .

. . .some kind of loser?

Come on, baby,
is this what losers look like?

You don't want me
to answer that question.

Hey, doctor said l should stay
off my feet for a week.

He said that two weeks ago, okay?

Ever since you came out
of your coma...

. . .you've been obsessing
about this not-atornado thing.

Well, it turns out,
my hunch may be right.

Something is destabilizing
the jet stream,

and it's becoming dangerous
and unpredictable.

Okay, stop it, Steve.

You're not a scientist anymore.

Actually, l was working
on my Ph.D in Meteorology

and Atmospheric Engineering.

Okay, don't talk to me like l'm stupid.
You know that l hate that.

All right, look, um, l'm sorry, baby.
lt's just, you know l...

Look, okay.

Whatever you were. . .

. . .they're never going to
let you be that again.

l'm sorry, but...

. . .that part of your life is over.

You have a new life now, with me, and...

instead of giving it a go,
you're just throwing it away.

You should be capitalizing
on this YouTube video thing.

Oh, come on, YouTube? Are you. . .
No, l mean, you know, TV, a book deal.

At least renegotiate
your contract with the station. But. . .

. . .all you're doing is sitting
in front of the computer,

researching something that
nobody believes ever happened.

lt was a freak accident, okay?

A tornado.

And now you're just in this
vicious downward spiral.

Wait a second, what did you just say?

lt was a tornado.
No, no, after that.

Vicious downward spiral?

Oh, my God. . . that... that's it.
That's what l've been looking for.

That's brilliant.
What?

You just said something that helped me
solve this problem that

l've been working on for, like, a month.

What are you doing?

Oh, my God.

Baby, you have no. . .

Steve. . .
This is huge. You have no idea.

l've got to go to work.

Ange!

Are you seriously considering allowing
a pile of fish to derail this program?

The British are asking questions.

Their experts believe this was
a motivated incident.

We'll be in a politically vulnerable position
when the program is revealed.

And why would we ever feel
a need to reveal it?

Our fingerprints have
to remain invisible, Major.

Let me... let me clarify something.

This weapons system leaves
no fingerprint whatsoever.

We're on the verge of transforming
America's strategic position

back to a level where
we will again be... unstoppable.

lf we discontinue this program,

do you think the Chinese will?

What about the Russians?

We need to swallow our fears and
remember what we're fighting for.

This is all well understood, Major.

However, we must warn you,

the success of this program
will have many fathers,

but its failure will be an orphan.
Are we clear?

Yes.

We're clear.

Thank you for your confidence.

What can l do for you, Doctor?

Security's been tracking
Steve Simpson's research.

The weatherman.

Yeah.
He may have had a breakthrough.

l have it keyed up down below
if you'd like to take a look.

The weatherman solved
a billion-dollar problem

that an entire research
facility couldn't?

More like discovered a deeper problem.

Go on.

When we took control of
the jet stream and accelerated it,

we destabilized
a natural phenomenon.

The higher speeds might have led
to a complex series of...

...chain reactions that may be
impossible to model.

Doctor, l know all this.

But l feel that it's leading to a complete
breakdown of many processes

that have contributed to. . .
Bottom line it.

lmagine the jet stream cycling the world,
accelerating itself over and over again.

At first, it might create
many jet streams,

splintering off unpredictably, randomly,
from the source.

But soon, as it increases in power,
the rogue streams grow as well,

increasing in size, growing
to be larger than any city,

any country, any continent.

They engulf the entire planet.

So how do we control it?

l don't think we can.

No. Wrong answer.
How do we control it?

We have passed the tipping
point here, Major.

No.

We were the catalyst, we created it,
that means we can control it.

l'm going to ask you one more time,
how do we control it?

l'm telling you that life on this planet is
about to face a major readjustment. . .

Do you think you're the first scientist...

to say it's the end of the world?

When they dropped the atom bomb,
they all said, ''Oh it's the end of the world.''

When they developed
the neutron bomb, they said,

again, lt's the end of the world.
Let me give you a hint.

The only thing that leads to the end
of the world is the end of the world.

lf we started it we can control it, and
that's exactly what we're gonna do.

l just...

l think that... l'm just. . .
. . .missing some pieces of the puzzle.

l need some help.

You have all the resources
of the United States military.

l need to bring Simpson in.

The weatherman again.

How do you think he's gonna feel
when he sees you?

How will he react. . .

. . .when he looks around

and sees his life's work
has been weaponized?

He only needs to understand
the more mundane uses of Thor.

We created all this
to bring rain to the desert.

That's my problem.
No.

Your problems are my problems,
and l don't want to carry your baggage.

Fine.
We need to bring in Simpson.

Bring in the weatherman.

Hey, it's sunny in Seattle!

So let's take a look
at how the day's developing

with Chopper Phil
and the morning traffic report.

Steve?

Uh, yeah, l'm down here, honey.
l...

l fell asleep at my desk.

Baby, you should take it easy
on yourself.

What were you doing?

You know what?

l'm really not quite sure
what l was doing.

But...

l think l have a feeling
l know what l'm doing today.

Yeah? What's that?

l'm going to go in,
l'm going to talk to Jack, and, uh,

maybe we'll launch this
Tornado Man thing,

You know.
Maybe he'll give me a show.

l'll make it fun with some fun facts,
you know, um,

. . .mix in some of that

Weatherman Gone Wild stuff, l guess.

That sounds great, baby.

You know, it's still pretty early.

You want to come upstairs
for a snuggle?

Hey.

You want some breakfast?

No, l'm good.
l'm going to grab something at the office.

l want to get in and close Jack,
you know?

That's the spirit.
Yeah.

See, l told you,
it's good to let go sometimes.

Yeah, you know?
What's the worst that could happen?

The end of the world?

Well, it's not.

What was l thinking?

Hey, you want to grab lunch
at the Green Tavern?

Yeah, sure.

All right, sounds good.

Don't be late, all right?

Good morning, sir.

Are you Steven Simpson?

Yeah.

l'm Agent Bo.

l'm going to need you
to come with us.

Hey, uh, sweetie don't forget
to make a reservation.

You know how crazy it gets there.

Uh, yeah, sure.
l got it covered. Don't-don't sweat it.

Right now?
Yes, sir.

What's this about?

lt's a matter of national security.

Do you understand?

Who are you talking to sweetie?

Oh, uh... l'm just talking to myself, baby.
You know, a little. . .

my crazy morning talk.
That kind of stuff.

We need to go, sir.

All right, but just give me
a second, okay?

Uh...

You know what?
The funniest thing.

l don't think l can make lunch.
Something just came up.

What is it?

lt-it's Jack. He, um, he wants to go over
some ideas for this new show.

But how did he know you were even coming in?
You just told me this morning.

Uh, it's... l know,
it's just a crazy coincidence.

Great minds think alike, you know?

Right. Okay, well, um, good luck.

All right, l gotta go.
l love you. Bye. Bye.

Sorry.

No outside communications.

Dude, you just rejected
my girlfriend's call.

You know what she's gonna do?

You must be a single fellow.

Must be.

Here, take a look at this.

Wow.

Top-secret document just for me?

Come on, come on!

We have breaking news coming in.

The Midwestern town of Madison,
Wisconsin was apparently

wiped off the map today

after what we're hearing might have
been the most powerful tornado on record.

lt touched down just moments ago.

Collateral damage, Major?
Success doesn't come without a price.

Now, put on your big-boy pants
and get back to work.

What is this place?

This is the operations room.

What's it for?

Why don't you go talk
to your buddy over there?

l'm sure he'll fill you in.

Hello, Steve.

Wow.
Now it all makes sense.

Who else would have knowledge
of my thesis but not understand it

. . .besides the guy who stole it?

l didn't steal it from you.
Really?

You know, we were partners for six years.
You were my friend.

And you turn around, you accuse me of
stealing government documents?

Plagiarism?
You testify against me!

lt's not that simple, Steve.
l guess not.

Because you up and vanished.

You know, the people back home,

they actually thought l had something
to do with your disappearance.

But the whole time, you were here,
wherever the hell we are,

working on some
secret government program.

You wanted to publish,
to give it all away.

Our gift to humanity?

Listen, Mr. Open Source,

did you really think the government

was just going to let you give
that kind of power away?

Daniel, what have you done?

Tell me you've not turned this
into a weapon.

Same ideals.

Using weather
for the betterment of Man.

lt's just under better control now.

Look, l didn't have a choice!
Everyone has a choice!

That's true.

So now you have to make a choice,
Mr. Simpson.

And who the hell are you?

Major Nicholas Shaw,
United States Air Force.

The genie's out of the bottle.

So, you two...

. . .can work together.

Or you can die together.

Feilder's choice.

A hundred square miles
just wiped off the map.

Why is this happening?

Well, when you geniuses
accelerated the jet stream,

because of the magnetic field,
it created a dynamo.

The faster it goes,
the more energy it creates.

But unlike a real dynamo,

there's no friction at 40,000 feet
to slow it down.

lnstead, there's this natural push
from the warming effect of the sun

and the Earth's rotation.

l... hadn't thought it out.

Yeah, well next time you mess
with the planet, you might want to.

Oh, what am l talking about?

There ain't gonna be no next time.

You having fun, Mr. Simpson?

Well. . .
Look at me. Focus.

Now, we need to get back on point
and figure out how to control it.

The question is, how do you stop that
which is unstoppable?

That's it.

l got it.

The only force strong enough to spin
down the jet stream is the jet stream itself.

We splinter off a portion of the stream,

turn it around,
ram it back into the main current.

Make a U-turn and slam it back
into the main stream?

Yeah.
That's your big idea?

Yeah, genius. Sometimes the simplest
ones are the best ones.

Unfortunately, we don't have
nearly that kind of control.

Well, if you take into account
the dynamo effect,

and build in the algorithms,
we would.

We've had hundreds of scientists,

the best minds in the world,
working on this for years.

What makes you think you're right?

A hunch?

A hunch.

A weatherman's intuition.

Let's get to work.

You ready for this, boys?

All right, let's do it.

Phew! That is a big plane.

Oh, no, no don't! Please.

l told you, no outside communications.

Come on, man
let me just call her back. Please?

This is going to make her a little bit crazy.
She goes nuts when l reject her calls.

Now with the first rejection
back in the car,

l can explain that.
l can sell that, make it look like an accident.

But a second one?
That's a serious offence.

Mr. Simpson.

l don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

And it's really not my problem.

Persistent, isn't she?
That's my girl.

No, no, please don't! Don't, don't, don't!
Hey!

l'm rejecting her call,
not putting a bullet in her kneecap.

Listen to me.

She will call the phone company
and place a trace on this call.

You don't need that.

What l don't need is a breach
of security protocol.

l understand, l promise you.

You can sit right here
and listen to everything l say.

lf l say one thing that's not kosher,
you can shoot me.

Put a bullet in my kneecap
or whatever you call it in your world.

Don't tempt me, Mr. Simpson.

Now, whatever you say,
it can't be the truth. . .

. . .or anywhere near it.
Okay, okay.

Got it?
l got it. l got it! Thank you.

Hey, hey, baby!

Steve where are you?
l called your office.

You haven't been in all day.
What are you doing?

Uh, you know, um... something came up.
Steve!

Okay, all right, um, honey,
l'm at a meeting.

You're at a meeting? lt's 10:00 p.m. at night.
Who are you with?

Well, um... This, uh...

. . .Bolivian coffee magnate.
Hugo Chavez.

He wants to fly me down to Bolivia

and study weather patterns that
are affecting their coffee crop.

Are you being serious right now?

Do you think l'm stupid?
Hugo Chavez is the president of Venezuela.

Dummy, dummy!
What's that sound?

Are you at an airport?

Uh. . . yeah.
l'm going on a trip, to Bolivia.

With Hugo Chavez.

Okay, Steve, are you with that girl?

Babe. . . there is no other girl.
l'm just caught up in a situation.

Right. Right, Steve, okay. . .
Ange, you've got to trust me on this one.

l promise you there is no other girl.

Okay, but you need to tell me
where you are exactly.

An airport.
What airport, Steve?

Uh, l don't know.
Honestly, l have no idea.

Why? Why are you lying to me?
Okay, time's up, 007.

Listen, baby l've gotta go.
l should be home, um, tomorrow.

l love you.
l love you so much. Okay, bye.

Steve!

What?

Feel better now?
Yeah, just great.

Looks like Mr. Simpson's prediction
is holding true.

We have a rogue jet stream forming
just off the west coast.

We only have one shot at this.
Let's make it count, people.

Failure is not an option.

Now give me com one.
Check.

And hydraulics.

Check.

All right, com two.

Check.

All right, give me 20 degrees.

Check.

Let's get this show on the road.

We have a bearing on the center
of the convergence.

Altitude 10,000 feet,
speed 350 miles per hour.

lt's going to be a bumpy ride, boys.

Buckle up.

We're in for a bumpy ride?
But we're going to be safe, right?

This is a big jet.
lt can handle the shearing forces, yeah?

Sure.
That's what these planes are built for.

Danger! Danger! Danger!

No problem.

Great. l feel safer already.

There it is.

Jet stream convergence is just ahead.
Everyone, batten down the hatches.

l'm not sure how this is gonna go.

Here we go!

Come on.
Come on, baby, hold on.

Give me 10 degree flap.

10 degrees.

l got power spiking
in generators three and four.

You want me to take them offline?
Negative, we're going to have to ride it out.

What the hell is going on back there?

l don't know, man.
l think he was electrocuted!

Jesus!
Check his pulse.

No pulse! Beginning CPR!

You're doing it all wrong.

l got this, man.
l saw this on Baywatch!

Move!

Come on.

Come on! Stay with me.

We've got to turn around.
This man needs help.

Not anymore.

Aw, come on!

Military operations don't just end
because people die, Mr. Simpson.

Now get to your workstations
while l secure the body.

Now.

Go.

Military mission...

This is purely a weapon. This has nothing
to do with making it rain in the desert.

That's what l've been trying to tell you.
You turned my work into a loaded gun!

They were going to steal it anyway.

l tried to guide it and keep humanitarian
but l was wrong.

Oh. . . Jesus.
You were right the whole time.

Absolute power.

Corrupts absolutely.

This is it, gentlemen.

Ground zero for the jet stream
is Seattle, Washington,

then moving southbound all
the way down the Pacific coast.

lt's now or never.

Copy.

Game time.

Target area is 20,000 meters
at your 10:00.

Roger. Closing on target.

Closing on target.

Commencing dispersal... now.

Releasing now.

They're gone.
First databurst coming in three... two...

. . .one.

Plugging data into Little Blue.

Whoa!

68% , Major.

That's already higher
than we've ever achieved.

This weatherman
is proving to be an asset.

lt's beautiful.

The level of detail is amazing.

Alluring, isn't it?

75% still rising.

We've reached 80% accuracy.

We may pull this thing out yet,
gentlemen.

Good work.

They're going to be naming
high schools after you, football stadiums.

120 seconds left of probes.

Copy. Switching to max projective.
We'll begin bursting.

But we're only at 81 % .

81 % is the highest
we've ever achieved.

We normally work
at a much lower percentage.

60% is considered a success.

Oh, yeah, l forgot. Collateral damage
never was an issue for you guys.

Guess not.

We have extreme acceleration.

They are leading the stream, sir.

Okay.

Let's save the world.

Beginning repositioning maneuver.

We have control of the stream.

Still go on reposition.

Dan, l think we may have a problem.

lt's all good. We're still within mission
parameters. Maintain course change.

Everything's good on our side.

Losing predictive accuracy!
Down to 73% .

No, 64% . We're losing control
of the jet stream!

l have total system failure!
Failure is not an option.

Hang in there.
We have to get control of the stream.

l need a solution.

Yeah, but l don't have one.

The system's locked up!

The splinter's going
to lose coherence any second.

l'm taking Little Blue offline.

Why?

You're going to have to control
the plasma discharges Steve.

Do it manually.
Manually?

Blue is making trillions
of operations per second.

Little Blue's a computer. You're intuitive.
lt'll fire wherever you point.

l have no idea where to point it!

Do it, Steve! Use your gut!

l'm a weatherman!
Just do it, damnit!

This is ridiculous. lt's not working.
Keep trying!

Coherence failure seconds away.

Dude, this isn't working.

l'm just not the guy, man.

Listen to me. You know we have
a massive storm convergence growing.

l know.
lf we don't stop it now,

every city on the west coast is going
to be wiped out.

Seattle's at ground zero,
so come on.

l know. . .
Use your gut.

l know what's happening!
lt's just impossible!

No way.

Hey!
You are not going to answer that!

lt's Angel.
No kidding!

What kind of service do you have?

Hey, baby.

Why is it so loud?

Steve, will you please
just tell me where you are?

l wish l could.

l don't understand
why you're lying to me.

lt's not as if you're on some secret
U.S. mission or something.

Ange, um,
everything is going to be fine.

No, it's not, Steve.

You can't just hurt me like this
and lie to me, and,

worst of all,
not even tell me where you are.

Ange, listen to me. Listen to me. . .
When you decide that you really love me,

you can give me a call.

No, no, no, Ange! Ange!

Damnit! Damnit!

Angel's moving out.
Yeah, like that's a big surprise.

Steve, do that again.

Do what again?

Steve, Angel's leaving you, right?

Yeah.
How does that make you feel?

lt makes me feel mad.

lt makes you feel angry, right?
Yeah, really angry.

What about me?
What about what l did to you?

l stole your life.
Does that make you angry?

Yeah, it makes me really angry.
You piss me off. You sold me out!

What else? Tell me what else.
Agent Bo back over there,

he pisses me off! He's an idiot
with a smirk on his face!

What. . . What else makes you angry?
This mission pisses me off!

And that weather station
KPQR, and Jack. . .

. . .the guy who wants me to be the
Weatherman Gone Wild.

He makes me go crazy!

What about the jet stream?
Does that make you angry?

The jet stream makes me crazy!
l wanna go insane!

l hate the jet stream!
All right. . . you hate the jet stream!

l hate the freaking jet stream!
All right, let's do this!

l hate it! l hate the jet stream!

l hate the jet stream! l hate it!
l hate the jet stream!

Coherence is strengthening.

Nice.

You're doing it! You're doing it!
The jet stream's refocusing!

l'm doing it! l'm doing it!
l can do this! l can do this!

Let's bring this sucker around, baby!

You heard him!
Let's complete the maneuver!

Copy! Resuming maneuver.
Bring it around! Bring this sucker around!

Yeah!

Full coherence restored.

Excellent, gentlemen.

lt's working.
We're within mission parameters.

We're a go for phase three.
Let's collide the streams.

Brace yourselves! Here we go!

Here we go!

What's our status?

Jet stream is normalizing.

Confirm that, please.

Confirmed, sir.
Jet stream is normalized.

Nice work.

Nice work, everybody.
l'll be in my office.

Yes, sir.

Good job. We did it. We did it!

No, you did it.

Unbelievable.

Unbelievable.
What?

What?

The accuracy indicator says 99% .

99% accuracy?

How's that even possible?

Little Blue learned
from what you were doing.

lt's solved the dynamic air flow model.

Completely.

l'm happy to report Thor's Hammer
is a fully operational weapon system.

Excellent work, Major.

What do you think's going
to happen now?

What do you mean?
We're heading back to base.

Yeah, we're heading back to base
with a fully operational weapons system.

What do you think's
going to happen to us?

A guy just died, and Captain America
over there played it off

like it was a bump in the road.

Do you think they're
going to let us go back to our regular lives?

l don't have a regular life.

Major, we have
a security issue up here.

Requesting a green light.

You got it.

l need you to safeguard Little Blue
and secure the transmission of all its data.

Am l making myself clear?

Yes, sir.

Sergeant, open up
a high-speed secure channel.

We're going to download their data.

Yes, sir.

Listen to me.

We'll never know when
or where they're going to use it,

'cause we'll never leave that base alive.

l say we wipe the drives on that thing.

Gentlemen. . .

we have orders
to open a secure channel

and then upload all data from
Little Blue back to base.

Why?

l'm going to need you to step away
from this terminal.

Yeah, well, that ain't going to happen.

Dr. Berg, begin the upload.

Daniel...

Daniel don't do it.

Once they get the data,
they're going to kill both of us.

Hey, Simpson, what's your problem?

You helped save the world.
Your country appreciates that.

Where's all this hostility coming from?

You heard the Major.

You guys stole my work once.

There's no way in hell
you're doing it again.

All right, whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right, all right, all right. Chill, chill.

Dr. Berg,

begin the upload... now.

lt's Angel!

No!

No!

That's gunfire.

Get back there and see
what's going on.

The next one's going
to be right through your heart.

Do you understand Simpson?

Now, for the last time, Dr. Berg,
start the upload.

That's better.

Hey, Jim, what's going on here?

l heard weapon fire.

lt's okay, Lieutenant.

l've got everything under control.

Cut it off.

l said, cut it off!

Put the gun down.

Shut it down.

l swear, l'll shoot. Shut it down!

l'll shoot you!

Are you really that good?

Are you sure
you won't hit your buddy over here?

Behind you!
Put your gun down.

Don't move!

Get back! Get back!

Don't you move.

Okay.

Look, you've had your fun.

Why don't you put the gun away
before you hurt yourself?

Get back! Get back!

You've got to be the worst shot
l've ever seen.

Really?

Oh, crap.

Help me!

Grab my hand!

Help!

Hold on!
Come on!

Come on!

No!

No!

The mission's been compromised!

Possible structural damage.

l need clearance to land immediately!
What is the ETA of that plane?

At their current rate and altitude,
about 15 minutes.

And the status on that data download?
Should complete in nine minutes,

as long as there are no interruptions.
Patch me through to the captain.

Done.

Captain, what is the status
of your plane?

Co-pilot is not responding.

ln emergency descent.
Again, requesting clearance to land!

Captain l need you to listen to me
very carefully.

l need you to put the plane
on auto-pilot right now.

l need you to go back to the control room
and secure the data download.

Do you understand me?
Major,

l do not recommend that l leave the
cockpit until l land this plane.

That is a direct order, Captain.

Captain!

Damnit.

Better?

Yeah, thanks!

You are crazy, man.

What the hell is going on back here?

Danny you've been shot!

Stop the upload!

Danny, hang on there.
l'll be right back!

The upload was completed!

We're below 10,000 feet!
You don't need a mask!

Get me to the cockpit!

Do you know how to fly this plane?
l learned a lot from these bastards!

What do you have in mind?
Just get me to the cockpit!

All right, brother, let's do this!

You got it? You got it?

Listen to me,
you need to get off this plane.

Get off the plane?

How am l going to do that?

Parachute.

Are you out of your mind?

Steve, you want to live?

You need to get to the back of the plane,
put on a chute and get out of here.

Danny, l am not going
to leave you here.

Wait, what are you doing?
Turning the systems back online.

We just saved the world!
Why would you turn it back on?

One more swing of Thor's Hammer.

you need to think this through.
Steve. . .

Steve. . . for once in your life,

you need to listen to me.

l'm taking this stream straight back
into the base.

This whole program
ends here and now.

Strap on that parachute
and get the hell out of here.

l am not going to leave you here to die.

Look at me.

l got a bullet in my gut.

l got maybe 10 minutes to live
before l bleed to death.

We knew that this might be
a one-way trip.

l don't want to go out of here

knowing that Shaw might win this.

No, man, no. We take out the base,

we land this beast, l get you to a hospital. . .
Steve!

Everything will be fine!
Steve! Steve that's not happening.

The only way
you're getting out of here

is a parachute.

Look... Look,
l took your life from you.

Let me give it back.

Now get out of here!

l miss you, brother.

Next time you get a great idea...

. . .keep it to yourself.

Now go!

Sir, l have a track on the plane.
They're returning to base.

ls the download complete?

Yes, sir. We have it all.
Any word from the pilot?

Negative.
Pilot has shut down all communications.

Activate anti-aircraft batteries.

Target the plane, Perez.

Sir, it's our plane.
lt's a rogue plane.

That's a direct order.
Target it now.

Put up the satellite.

Satellite's up.

They're pulling the jet stream
right at us.

N-9-9-0-7, C-1 7,

you're diverted to Alexander Airbase.

Please acknowledge.

Coming right back at you.

Open the blast shield.

l want to see what the hell's going
on out there.

lt's coming right at us.
Wind speed?

800 miles an hour.

Weapons live.

Fire.

See you in hell.

Direct hit, sir. The plane is down.

l want this base put on
lock-down right away. Get to it.

Sergeant, l want that downloaded
secured, and encrypted ASAP.

Yes, sir.
Sir?

lt's still coming, sir.

This has turned into a real bad day.

lt's beautiful.

Shut it down. Shut it all down.

Thor's Hammer never existed.
ls that clear?

Hello?

Steve?

Hey, Angel.
How are you doing, baby?

How do you think l'm doing?
l'm leaving.

l just called to tell you
l'm leaving my keys in your mailbox.

No, no, Ange,
please don't do that. Don't.

How am l supposed to trust you when you
won't even tell me where you are?

What's that sound?

Are you at another airport?
No, l'm, uh...

l am definitely not at an airport, but...

. . .it is a helicopter.

Hang on. Steve, take your right hand
and wave to the helicopter above you.

Hey, Angel.

Hey, Angel. ls that you, babe?

We continue with live coverage
from our news helicopter

that is over what appears to be
the only survivor from a C-1 7 crash.

Early reports indicate that

what may have been
a weather weapons test gone out control

caused the plane to crash and
destroy the military test facility.

The death toll may be in the hundreds as
we wait for further reports.

So far, no government sources. . .

. . .have made any statements...
Oh, my God. Steve, is that you?

lt's me.
l guess you know where l'm at.

Where am l?

ln a world
where weather's gone wild,

only one man has the insight. . .

. . .the talent, the power to forecast
what's coming at you.

Steve Sunny Simpson is...

The Weatherman!

Cut!

Cut!

All right, man, l think we've got it.

What did you think? That was awesome.
Yeah, it was pretty good but l want. . .

l want to go again.
Oh, okay. . . / Reset! Going again!

Okay.
Why? What was wrong with it?

You know, l just want to take
it up a notch. l want to pump it up.

Know what l mean?
l want it to be Richter.

l'm going to really go for it
on this one, okay?

Also. . . if you can get
the camera guy to have

the crane swoop in a little bit lower.

Maybe. . . he can drop
that crane down a little?

l've got a better angle over here.

Cool, all right. Maybe a wider lens
and some more back light.

Now you're talking, dude.
Now you're talking, baby.

And also, crank that wind machine up.
Crank it up to 1 1 .

Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. l can handle it.

You know what? lt's all about
entertainment, baby, right?

All right.
We owe it. We're entertainers.

Knuckles, come on, baby, knuckles.
Blow it up?

Blow it up, baby!

Yeah.
Hey l wanted to pitch you something.

l've got this idea for a show.

Oh, well, you've got to talk
to my manager.

Sure. . .

. . .what did you have in mind?

Well, you know there's all these
stories about how the Chinese

and the Russians have all this
weather modification technology?

And you got this
Weatherman Gone Wild thing,

you're a scientist kind of dude.

l thought you could, like, totally host it.
You'd rock, and you'd be awesome.

Yeah, man, you know, l don't think that's
something l can get behind, dude.

lt's just not my thing.

We need to work more with nature.

Get more in harmony
with Mother Nature.

That's something l can get behind.

What do you think, Ange?
Absolutely.

All right.
You dig it? You dig it?

All right, let's shoot this baby!
Come on!

See, baby?
l told you, you're made for this stuff.

And l was made for you.

Weatherman Gone Wild!

lt's a weatherman gone wild!

We did it!
