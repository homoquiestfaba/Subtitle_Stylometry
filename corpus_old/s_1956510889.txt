<i>You'll float too!</i>

<i>SEPTEMBER 1989</i>

I saw all of us

All of us were there, back in the cistern

But we were older.
We were our parents ages.

Am I still handsome as an adult?

You grow into your looks.
What the fuck does that mean?

What about me?

Like now; but taller.

Swear it... Swear if IT isn't dead

If IT ever comes back, we'll come back too.

Memory, it's a funny thing

People want to believe they are
what they choose to remember

The good stuff

The moments

The places

The people we all hold on to

But sometimes

Sometimes, we are what we wish to forget.

<i>27 YEARS LATER</i>

Okay, kids. Get ready, GO!

First one to pop their balloon's a winner

It could be anyone.
We've got a real barn-burner here.

It's so close,
who's gonna catch the leader, huh?

Who's gonna be the big winner tonight?
Oh yeah!

Winner, winner, a chicken dinner.
You really showed them.

I did.

Hey girl... you want this?

Thanks for letting me win.

What did you get, Vickie?

Well... Here is your consolation prize.

Look at that.
I have never been a fan of the beaver.

But look at this hat, great.

Thank you.

So, we need to talk logistics.

How romantic.
Romantic?

What's so fucking romantic, huh?

Hey.

Your mamas ever teach you boys to responds to
someone when they ask you a fucking question

Come on, Adrian.

Got a problem, faggot?

I don't but Meg Ryan called.

She wants here wig back

All right, all right,
come on, come on, Adrian.

Stuff like that is why I have to
leave this shithole town. Small minds.

They have small dicks.
I'm serious.

We belong elsewhere.

Look if you end up hating New York,
we could always move back here

I just want to be with you. I don't
care if it's in New York or in Derry,

Whatever it is, it is...

You have to say it.
I don't have to say anything.

Take off that fucking hat.
Come on.

We don't want to give people the impression that we
allow a bunch of fucking fairies like you in this town

He was born here, asshole.
Alright, let's go.

No, you know what?
I'll take off the hat for you,

But why leave it there?

Anything else you would like me
to take off for you, tonight?

Any special requests, ladies?

Fucker.
Let him go!

What's that? -Stop.
I don't think you'll be needing that.

Leave him alone!
Hit him.

He's got asthma, fucker!

Come on. Fuck him up!

Come on, kick him. Come on!
Kick the shit outta him! -Adrian!

I still hate your fucking hair.

Adrian!

Get the fuck off of him

Look what you did to his fucking face.

Hey, hey!

Help me get him up.
Adrian!

Help me get this fucking punk
up, right now.

Give me that hat, Chris.

It's fucking mine.
Give me the fucking hat!

Adrian!

Welcome to Derry, you fucker.

No, Adrian! Nooooo!

Nooooo!

Adrian!

Help!

Help me.

Somebody fucking help me!

Adrian

Noooooooooo!

Adrian!

<i>You'll float down here!</i>

<i>Thing is...</i>

<i>sometimes what we wish was forgotten...</i>

<i>What we try to leave in the past...</i>

<i>Won't stay there.</i>

<i>Units, please respond.
We're getting reports of</i>

<i>a body found dismembered.</i>

<i>Come back. You say "dismembered"?</i>

<i>That's affirmative. It was found
at the entrance of the Festival.</i>

<i>Copy that. The vehicle is on its way.</i>

<i>That's affirmative. The Chief said
to tape off at Derry's street bridge.</i>

<i>Sometimes, IT comes back for you.</i>

Mr. Denbrough, they need you on set.

All good?
This way.

I can do it, I can do it..
Hey! Clear the door!

C'mon You ever see Indiana Jones?
Watch your back.

Hey, hey, you a crew member?
I'm... the... writer.

Your husband is here.
Hey, do you have the pages?

My friend, a film needs an ending.

You do know that, right?
Oh yeah.

You said that you needed
another day to finish the pages.

We're shooting this thing, it's tonight.
It's been 17 hours.

Everyone calm down, okay?
I'm calm.

I want you to be happy with the movie.

Do you get understand I am on your side.

That's, that's great,
because in my book the ending...

Is terrible.

All due respect, people loved your
book, loved but they hated the ending.

You said you liked the ending.
That was a lie.

We have to do better, okay?
Yeah.

Audra, you have my notes, could you?

Okay thank you very much.
Take me back to One, please.

Bye. You have his notes?

He's not wrong.

You hate my endings too?
Not all of your endings, but this...

Okay.
Just...

What? Do you want me to keep lying to
you just because I'm... -You're my wife?

No, no but you've been blowing
smoke up my ass for eight years.

I guess I just thought you were someone else.
I have not been blowing smoke up your ass.

Everyone wants a happy ending.
Everyone wants closure.

But that's not the way life works out.
Think what Peter wants, no, what the studio wants.

Studio? When did you become a company man?
You're an artist.

C'mon what wrong with just doing it the
way it's written? The way I want it.

What's wrong with being
the woman I want you to be?

Fuck you, Bill!

On the page, the part, I mean, not you.

Hello?
Bill Denbrough?

It's Mike.
Mike, who?

Mike Hanlon from Derry.

You need to come home.

<i>Eddie, I keep telling you not to scare
me like this and you never listen to me.</i>

Myra, please, not now.
You shouldn't be out there.

Eddie, it's not safe to drive on
when the roads are slick like this.

Sweetheart, it stopped raining like three
hours ago. Everything's gonna be fine.

Hey! Dickhead, flow of traffic mean anything to you?
What if you hydroplane?

I'm not gonna hydroplane.

It is my job to assess risks,
so please trust me when I tell you

that statistically speaking I am much
more likely to get into an accident

Because I'm talking to you on the phone.

Okay? I have to go, I'll talk soon.
Goodbye.

Edward Kaspbrak speaking

<i>You didn't say, "Okay, bye,
I love you." Like you usually do.</i>

Listen to me, I can't,
I'm gonna be late for...

<i>CALL INPUT DERRY, MAINE</i>

meeting.
Say I love you, Eddie.

Okay, I love you mom.

What?
Myra, bye.

Hello who's this?
It's me. It's Mike.

Mike, who?

Eddie, you okay?
Yeah, pretty good.

What the fuck! You were fine like five
seconds ago. Who was that? Who called?

Rich, talk to me.
You're on in two minutes. You good?

Because you look not good.

I'm fine.
You're fine, okay.

And we're walking, we're walking.

60 seconds.
Even faster.

Bring him a bottle of water.
Bourbon.

Sure. And a mint.

I don't think I can do this.
And that was fast.

Okay. Rich, where are you going?

This way, attaboy! Okay.

How I look?
Your hands are shaking, Rich.

Shit.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Richie Tozier.</i>

All right. How we doing tonight?

So my girlfriend caught me, uh,

masturbating to her friend's Facebook page

And so now I am in Masturbators Anonymous.

I stand up at the first meeting and say:

"My name is Richie Trashmouth."

Trashmouth...

I forgot the joke.

You suck!!!!

Thank you ladies and gentlemen,
for letting us present to you today

Now this will include over
a million square feet of

Commercial and residential space.
State of the art office towers.

What I am really looking for is to understand how
we can create even more retail opportunities

If we put in walls here and all along here...
Lose them.

With all due respect, Mr. Hanscom.
Ben, please and with all due respect to you...

I'm getting claustrophobic just
looking at this model. Aren't you?

Look, throw up more walls,
it's gonna look like a prison.

And you know what people want
to do in prison? Get out, right!

It should be a place that
brings people together.

Meeting ground

A Club House

And if while people are there

Excuse me for one second

Hello.
Ben, it's Mike Hanlon from Derry.

Should I just book it?

You sure you can get away from work?
It's summer, why not?

Okay, we are Buenos Aires bound.

Stanley Uris speaking

It's Mike.
I'm sorry?

<i>Mike Hanlon from Derry.</i>

Mike, god, sorry. Yes, hi.

I didn't, I don't know why I...

How long has it been?
A long time

<i>27 years.</i>

It's come back, hasn't it?
That's why you're calling me?

It's starting again,
Stan and bad things are happening.

Did you call the others?
What if they don't come? I mean...

We made a promise, remember?
How soon can you get here?

Well, uhm, uh. I would need to do a few things.
Tomorrow?

<i>We don't have much time.</i>

<i>I'll text you everything you'll need.</i>

I'll see you soon, Stan the man.

(no audio) Do you swear?

I swear, Bill.

You made a promise, Beverly.
I'm so sorry, Mike.

I don't even really remember.

Haven't you even wondered why
you can't seem to remember things

that most people should,
about where they're from, who they are.

<i>Why you have that scar on your hand?</i>

<i>No one else remembered it either.
Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie.</i>

Bill.
Bill?

You have to come back.

You all do.
When?

Whoa, are you okay? What's going on?

It's uh, the middle of the night.
You're packing?

I didn't want to wake you, honey.
I know this week's been really exhausing.

I just go a phone call from
an old friend from Derry.

I have to go back there.

It's really hard to explain why.
It's okay.

You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Relax.

I trust you.
Thank you.

I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me.

I heard you. You said the name Mike.

Yes my friend.
There was a group of us back then

and we all made a promise to
each other when we were kids.

You know that trust is everything in our
relationship. You know that's everything to me.

Right?

I know, it isn't...
What? The last time?

I never cheated on you and...
You're a bad fucking liar, Bev.

You're not going anywhere, okay?
I want you to stay right here

and you're gonna show me what it is
you're going to do with Mike, okay?!

You're hurting me, honey.

No one else is gonna love you like me.
You know that, right?

I'm sorry.

Don't make this fucking harder!

You're nothing without me!
You know it, right?

<i>Tell me I'm wrong!</i>

Jesus Christ, boys!

Little prick's got balls, I'll give
him that. That's far enough, Bowers.

I'm not done yet, I'm not done, I not fucking done.
On your knees!

No, I got to kill them all!

Fucking kill them all! Stop! Fuck you!

Cuff this sorry sack of shit.
Fuck you!

Henry Bowers, I am placing you under
arrest for the murder of Oscar Bowers.

Do you understand, dipshit?

You have the right to an attorney.

You have the right to remain silent.

Anything you say can and will be
used against you, in a Court of law

Bowers!

Bowers, calm the fuck down.

Someone needs a little
extra clozapine today, huh?

Stay in your fucking room.

Hockstetter?

My knife

Careful, this way

Thanks alot

Hey

Mike, you look good.
Hey, how you doing?

Bill

I didn't know if any of you would

But of course you came.
An oath is a oath.

The losers...

Gotta stick together, right?
The losers? You remember that.

That's good. What else do you remember?

I'm allergic to soy,
anything that has egg in it, gluten

And if I eat a cashew,
I could realistically die.

Holy shit!

Is there a password or something?

I'm sor...
The "<i>New Kid</i>".

Ben?
Yeah

Oh my god!
Oh my god!

It's been so long.

<i>Stay cool, Ben from soc class.</i>

<i>- You too, Beverly.
Hang Tough, new kid on the block.</i>

Wow! You two look amazing.
What the fuck happened to me?

Hey, I'm Ben.
Richie.

Yes, and Bev

Hi.
Hey

Is it me or has the Losers
Club officially begun.

Look at these guys.

(No audio) Ben

So wait, Eddie, you got married?
Why's it so fucking funny, dickwad?

What, to like a woman?
Fuck you bro.

Fuck you!
Alright and what about you, Trashmouth? You married?

There is no way!
No, I got married!

Rich, I don't believe it.
When?

You didnt' hear this.
You didn't know I got married?

You do not know?
No.

Me and your mom are very,
very happy right now.

Terribly happy

He totally fell for it.
Fuck you!

She is very sweet. Sometimes she'll put her arm
around me and whisper (speaks like Jabba the Hut)...

We all get it, my mom was a
very big fat person. Hilarious.

Hysterical

Yes, it is a nice watch.

Let's talk about the
elephant not in the room. Ben

What the fuck, man?
Okay, okay obviously I lost a few pounds.

Lost a few pounds. -No shit, lost a few...
You're like a, you're hot!

You're like every Brazilian soccer
player wrapped up into one person

Leave him alone, you're embarrassing him.
Okay, okay, alright, please.

Come on!

Is Stanley coming or what?

Stanley

Stanley Uris.
Yes.

Stanley Urine No, He's a fucking
pussy, he's not going to show.

Why would Stanley save you, anyway?

Was I not the one who basically performed
surgery on you when Bowers cut you up

Holy Shit, that's right.
Please tell me you ended up becoming a doctor, Eds?

No, I ended up becoming a risk analyst.

Oh that sounds really interesting,
what does that entail?

Yes. I work for like a big insurance
firm and uh... (Richie snoring)

Fuck you, dude. Fuck you!

Was this job invented before fun?

That's so not funny.

It is funny.

What the fuck are you laughing at?
I propose a toast.

To the losers.

Aw here we go. Thank you.

Logan-Marsh, half my wife's closet,
that Logan-Marsh. That's huge.

That's our line, me and my husband, Tom.

How long you been married?

Hey, we saw your movie.
Seriously?

By the way, It was so good, it was so scary.
And the ending sucked?

Yeah, it did, I'm sorry.
It's alright.

What?
This is just weird.

All this. All these memories and people
that I don't even remember forgetting.

I mean it's weird, right?

Now that we're all here, everything just
comes back faster. Faster, I mean all of it.

Yes.
When Mike called me, I threw up.

Isn't that weird?
I got nervous, sick and threw up.

I'm feel fine now. I feel very
relieved to be here with you guys.

Why are you looking at me like this?
When Mike called me, I crashed my car.

Seriously?
Yes.

Man, I hear ya. I mean my heart was literally
like pounding right outta my chest.

I thought it was only me.
It was like...

pure (stuttering) fear.

It was fear, what you felt.

Why do we all feel like that, Mike?

You remember something we
don't, don't you, Mike?

Something happens to you
when you leave this town.

The farther away, the hazier it gets.

But me, I never left.

So, yeah, I remember...

I remember all of it.

Pennywise

oh the fucking clown.
Oh shit.

Pennywise...

Mike, you said you wanted our help
with something. What was that?

There's an echo, here in Derry,
that bounces back every 27 years.

What are you talking about?
Hold on, listen, listen.

We thought we stopped IT back
then, we thought it was done.

Mike.
A week ago...

A man, Adrian Mellon, slaughtered. A girl,
Lisa Aubrich, the other night went missing.

There already others and there will be more.
You know what happened?

Take it easy. -Can I get another drink?
Let him explain.

That echo, we might have changed it.

Just like it changed us,
but we didn't stop it.

Because it just bounced back.

We made an oath.

That's why I brought you back.
That's why you're here.

To finish it, for good.

Well, that shit darkened fast.
Thanks, Mike.

My fortune cookie just says "could."

They don't know how to
do fortune cookies here,

Mine just says "Guess."

You wanna throw that over here.

What do you got, Mike?

What is it?

Guess, cut, could, not, it
It's a message.

Guess it could not cut.
That makes no sense.

What does that mean?
I don't know what that means.

(overlapping voices).
It could not guess.

That means that. Are you talking about him?

When it talks about it, does it mean it?
Mike, where is this going?

Is that what IT means?

I do not know.

Did you fuck with the
fortune cookies, Mike?

Let him speak.
This is not me. This is what...

IT does. -I need my fucking inhaler?
What is wrong with you man?

Why are you messing with us?
This is so not funny.

Why does it say Stanley?
Will someone else fucking answer me.

Oh shit.

Shit.

(Bev screams) -What is that?

What the fuck is that, man?
Oh my god.

Shit.

Hey, hey!

That fortune cookie's looking at me!

I do not want to be here.
I want to go home. I do not care.

I do not want to be here. Holy shit!

Whoa, hey, goddammit!

Eddie!

It's not real!

It's not real! (repeating)

It's not real!

Is everything alright?

Yeah, can we get the check?

That's what Pennywise does, He fucks
with us. So Stanley's probably fine.

Wait, Mike,
do you have Stan's number? -Yeah.

<i>Hey Richie!</i>

How do you know my name?

The fun's just beginning, right?

What did he say?
Do you think this is funny?

Do you think this is some sort of game?

Huh? Well, fuck you, alright!
Rich, be careful.

Fuck you! I am not afraid of you!

The fun's just beginning,
the line from your act, dude.

I'm a fan.
Those your parents?

Yeah

Do you want a picture?
Are you okay, Dean?

I think I'm good.
Okay, well, cute kid.

Jesus, Richie. Don't you remember
a line from your own show?

I don't write my own material.

I fucking knew it!!! I fucking knew it!!!!

Hello Mrs. Uris. My name's Beverly Marsh

I apologize for calling,
but I am an old friend of your husbands.

You lied to us. This is not OK.

The first words out of your mouth should have been like
"Hey man, you want to come to Derry and like get murdered?"

Cause I would have said no.
Guys

Fucking entrapment

<i>Oh, uh he passed.</i>

When did it happen?
Yesterday.

<i>It was so horrible, the way he died .</i>

his wrists.
(both simultaneously) In the bathtub

<i>I'm sorry, I have to, have to go.</i>

We're all very sorry.
Thank you.

Stanley

Pennywise knew, he knew before we did.
We have to stop it.

I have a plan.
I have a plan getting the fuck outta dodge

Before it ends worse than one
of Bill's books. Who's with me?

We made a promise to each other.
Let's unmake, unmake the promise.

Richie, other people are gonna die.

Other people die everyday, man,
we don't owe this town shit.

Plus I just remembered that I
grew up here like two hours ago

So I'm fucking leaving, fuck this!

I'm sorry, I agree with Richie.

Guys, please.
Listen what we stay, we die. That's it?

I'm gonna go back to the inn. I'm gonna pack
up my shit and I'm gonna drive to my home.

Sorry man, good luck.
Eddie, please, please, Eddie, wait!

You okay?

I'm gonna head back with the rest too, you coming?
Yeah.

You should have told us, Mikey.
Bill.

Please man, I'm begging you, please.
Just listen to me, man,

Please!

What are you going to say?

What can you possibly say that'll
make any kind of a difference?

They all have gone

Let me, let me show you something.

One thing.

And if you want to leave, you can leave.

But let me show you this first, please.

My mom swings better than you.
Stop.

He doesn't even play baseball. You suck!

Mom, how much longer?
Victoria, we came watch the game,

we're gonna watch the game.

<i>(Chanting)</i> Go Derry go! Go Derry go!

Hello Vickie.

Isn't that what your friends call
you, Vickie?

How did I know that,
I guess I must be your friend too.

If you are my friend,
why are you hiding in the dark?

You are not my friend. You're scary.

Why are you crying?

People always make fun
cause of the way I look.

I thought if you couldn't see my face,

Then maybe you'd want to be my friend.

Uhhh never mind.

Oh silly old Pennywise,
you'll never have no friends.

People make fun of me too.
They do?

Cause of this.

Isn't that silly?

For that little thing.

I could blow that thing right away.

You could?
Oh yes, one poof and it'll be gone.

Oh, but you would have to get
close enough to see my face.

I don't know, Vickie.

No, it's okay. I won't make fun, I promise.

Promise, promise?

Okey-dokey!

Come in a little closer and we'll
blow it away on the count of three.

One.

Two.

You're supposed to say three...

The fuck!?
Boo!

Fuck, yeah!

Hey, Hockstetter. let's go!

Let's get our shit and get the fuck outta here.
Did you leave your stuff here?

No, my stuff's still in the car.

Tell me.
Tell you what?

Whatever it is you're
afraid to tell me right now.

Bev, Bev, back at the Jade when you
were on the phone with Stanley's wife...

She told you that she
found him in the bathtub,

But, Bev, I saw you.
I heard that you said it first.

Whatever you guys are talking about lets
make it happen fast, alright we gotta go.

Eduardo, andale, let's go!
There's something you're not telling us.

You knew how Stanley died. You knew.

Wait, what?
I can't do this.

She knew how Stanley was gonna
die, is that what she just said?

You can't just walk away from this.
How did you know where he killed himself?

Bev?

Talk to me, just talk to me
like we used to. -Come on!

How did you know?

Because I saw it.

I've seen all of us die.

I just got to get my
toiletry bag and we can go.

What did I miss?

The library?

Didn't this place used to be bigger?

Yo. Mike, where did you go?

Mike, do you live here?
Yeah, make yourself at home.

Do you want some water?
Sure.

Memory's the thing...

it's the key, the key to everything.

If IT really wants us

Don't you think the smartest thing we
can do is get the hell outta Derry?

No, no, no. IT does want us back.

Of course IT does, but IT doesn't
know that I know what I know.

What do you know?
How to kill the shit out of him.

I've read every book

And I talked to every person
in this god-forsaken town.

Everybody that would talk to me anyway
and that's that's not a long list.

But it wasn't enough, I didn't know

How it all started.

How IT started...

And IT started... here.

Whoa what am I looking at Mike?
It's an artifact.

Early 18th century, Shakopee.
Shakopee, how'd you get it?

I found it. They gave, gave it to me.

I stole it.
You stole it?

From Native Americans?
It's complicated.

Yeah it is.
They helped me on my journey.

Its so beautiful.
They showed me things, a vision.

I feel kinda funky. Hot...

Am I'm sweating?
I need you to see what they showed me, Bill (echoing)

<i>They lived outside of Derry.
Beyond ITs reach.</i>

<i>They moved there many years ago.</i>

<i>They're holy men,
they're holy of holiest...</i>

<i>They took me in.</i>

<i>Fed me their sacred drink.</i>

<i>I started to... to react.</i>

All living things must abide by the laws of

the shape they inhabit.

While I sat there looking out
over the valley, I saw IT arrive

I knew that one day I would
have to make you all see.

Mike?

Did you put something in my drink?

That's uh... It's a root.
You?

You drugged me?
No, it's a root with properties

It's a just micro dose of
what the Shakopee gave me.

Why would you do that?

To open your eyes.
I don't feel real good..

I need you ...To look.

And you will see.
I don't feel good.

<i>They showed me the past.</i>

<i>They showed me the way IT appeared to them.</i>

<i>They showed me their pain.</i>

<i>They showed me how to stop it.</i>

You okay?

Did you see it, the ritual?

The ritual of ChÃ¼d.
I knew it. I knew you would see.

I saw the whole fucking thing Mike.
That's how we kill IT

How are we gonna do it?
Everybody already said no.

With you, they'll listen.

This will work, with all of us.

Okay, so what do you mean
that you've seen us all die?

Yeah, because I've gotta be honest, that's
a fucked up thing to just drop on somebody.

Every night since Derry...

Having these nightmares.

People in pain, people dying.

People...

So, you have nightmares. I have nightmares.
People have, they have nightmares

But that doesn't mean that
your visions are true.

I've watched every single
one of us this week

You've seen every single one of us, what?

To the place that Stanley wound up.

That's how we end.

How come the rest of us aren't seeing
that shit? What makes her so different?

The dead lights -Dead lights

She was the only one of us that got
caught in the dead lights that day.

We were all touch by it, changed

Deep down, like an infection or a virus.

Virus, you understand? slowly...

The virus, it's been growing for 27
years, this whole time, metastasizing.

It just got to Stan first...
Because he was the weakest.

Jesus Christ, Rich.
I'm just saying what everyone else is thinking, man.

I mean Rich, c'mon

What Beverly sees, it will come to pass

It'll happen to all of us
eventually, unless we stop it

How the hell are we supposed to do that?

The ritual of ChÃ¼d

The Shakopee

The first ones who fought it.
They have a saying:

"All living things must abide by
the laws of the shape they inhabit."

A tribal ritual?

Are you fucking kidding me, man?

Alright, there's gotta be another way. This
thing comes back, what, every 27 years?

Let's kick the can down the road and do it then.
Then we'll be 70 years old, asshole.

It doesn't work that way.

None of us make it another 20 years and

the way it happens

So, if we don't beat IT this cycle then...

We die

Horribly

Yeah I don't need the horribly part.
I didn't' say it, She said it, not me.

Alright guys,
look I've seen what he's talking about

And it's, it's all true. It's the only way.

If we want this ritual to work...
We have to remember.

Remember what?

It's better if I show you...

We don't have much time.

The cycle will end soon.

And once it does...
We're fucked

The Barrens - This is where we came...

After the rock fight.
The Club House.

Yes, yes, You built that for us.
The hatch has got to be around here somewhere

I do remember that

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you okay?

What?
Nothing.

It's just, you haven't changed,
it's a good thing. (laughing)

You know what, I actually
think the door was more like...

around...

Found it.

I'm okay, come down!

What the dick is this? How'd you build it?

When did you build it?
Here and there, I guess.

It was already dug up for some reason,
just had to reinforce the walls

And get some wood for the roof
door and that's pretty much it.

Pretty good for my first time, huh?

Now that's a cool feature.

What happens when you put your hand
on the other pillar, Professor?

You see this is exactly why there are
safety codes, why we have permits,

This place is a deathtrap,
you understand that?

It's a work in progress, okay Eddie.
Just so you know, if I get hurt you are liable.

What is this? This switch from Iron Maiden?
That's a flashlight.

What is that? A horse hitch?
When do you have horses down?

This is cool.
That was like three dollars, so be careful with that please.

I have one of these,
hey Stan, you see this?

Yeah, can you maybe not?
What?

Maybe not, yeah, maybe not what? Be awesome and have
fun and celebrate the magic of the paddle ball.

Wow, oh good going fucknut
you broke his thing.

I broke it?
Yeah, you broke it with your face.

What?
I'm not putting my fucking hand down there.


Why do we all not remember this being here?

Hey, losers.

Time to float

Fuck Richie.

Dude!
Remember he used to say that shit?

He'd do that little dance

Am I the only one who remembers this shit?
Are you going to be like this the entire time we're home?

Just trying to add some levity
to this shit, I'll go fuck myself

Smells so fucking terrible in here.

Hey you guys

This, this, Stan

For the use of Losers only

Bill

The fuck is this?

So you don't get spiders stuck in
your hair when you're down here

Stanley, we are not
afraid of fucking spiders.

I stand corrected.
That's a first.

Touche.
Hey Rich, your ten minutes are up.

What are you talking about?
The hammock, ten minutes each was the rule.

I don't see any sign.
Are you being this was right now, I mean really!

Why would there be a sign,
if there was a verbal agreement?

I don't remember agreeing on anything.
We agreed on the fucking rule!

I can see your vagina.
Ten minutes each.

I fucked your mom.
No you didn't.

Take that back dickface.
Fuck you!

You're awfully good at this new kid.
Yoy really think so?

There's actually a summer
program in Bar Harbor

Teaches you everything about architecture

I was thinking about applying.
I'll do that.

I'll do anything to get
the hell out of Derry

Man, when I graduate, I'm going to Florida.
What's in Florida, Mike?

I don't know, I guess it's a
place I always wanted to go.

Stan, you should go with Mike to Florida.
You already act 80,

You'd clean up with all of the grandmas.

Do you guys think we will still be friends?

When we are older?
What?

Why wouldn't we be?

Do any of your parents still hang out
with their friends from middle school?

I mean, things might be different then.

We all might be different.

We'll always still be friends

I don't think that just goes
away because we get older

Yeah Stan, come on.

You don't have to be so...

sad.

He was old before his time.
Yeah

Wonder what he was like all grown up?
Probably what he was like as a kid.

The best.

Alright, Mike, what are we doing here?

The ritual, to perform
it, requires a sacrifice.

Sacrifice, I nominate Eddie.

Wait! What?
Because you're little, you'll fit on a barbecue.

I'm 5'9", that's like average
height for most of the world.

It's not that kind of a sacrifice, guys.

Mike

The past is buried.

But you're gonna have to dig it up.
Piece by piece.

And these pieces, these artifacts...

That's why we are here.

They are what you will sacrifice.
And since Stan isn't here to find his,

I figure we should all be here
together to find his artifact.

I think Bill just did that.

Ok Mike, so where do we find our tokens?

I've gotta be honest, with all due respect

This is fucking stupid, alright,
why do we need tokens, alright

We already remember everything,
saving Bev, defeating IT, I mean

We're caught up.
That's not everything.

We fought, but what happened after that?

Before the house on Neibolt

Think.

We can't remember, can we?

You see, there's more to our
story, what happened that summer.

And those blank spaces,
like pages torn out of a book...

That's what you need to find.
We need to split up.

You each need to find your artifact, alone.

That's important. When you do,
meet me at the library tonight.

I gotta say statistically
speaking survival scenarios

we're gonna do much better as a group

Yes, splitting up would be dumb, man.

We got to go together,
we were together that summer, right?

No

Not that whole summer.

Take it back!

Bill!

You just a bunch of wusses.

Fuck off!
Stop!

We were all together when we hurt
IT, that's why we are still alive

Yeah? Well I plan to keep it that way.

I bet by tomorrow,
we'll all be back together.

I don't think so.

Well if we want to stop IT we gotta be.

Maybe Richie was right.

Maybe we shouldn't do anything about it, maybe we can't.
Don't let them get to you.

It's a little late for that.

I should go.

Before your dad sees.

Yes?
Sorry.

<i>KERSH</i>

Can I help you?

I thought I rang Marsh.
Marsh?

Alvin Marsh?
My father, I grew up here.

Dear, it's not for me to tell you this,

But, your father passed away.

I'm so sorry, you didn't know?

We haven't spoken in a while

Well, won't you come in?

Let me offer you something to drink.
No, it's fine. I have to go.

It's the least I can do.

Sure. Okay.

Is it like you remember?
Cleaner.

Well you feel free to look around,
while I get the water boiling.

Really, it's fine, you don't need to do that.
Don't be so polite!

Today is her birthday.

I can still smell her perfume.

And she would still be
alive, if it wasn't for you.

Momma was sick.

You know that's why she did what she did.

She did what she did, because she
was embarrassed to be your mother!

You look like her.

But you are nothing like her.

Come here.

I said come here!

Close your eyes.

You know that I would never hurt you.

You know that, don't you?

I'm sorry.

You will always be my little
girl, won't you?

Always.

Your hair is winter fire, January embers.

<i>My heart burns there too.</i>

There. I do apologize.

It gets so very hot here this time of year.

It's fine.
You feel like you could just about die...

But you know what they say about Derry.

No one who dies here ever really dies.

But tell me how is it being back in Derry?

It's kind of strange.
Strange?

Oh my! Strange how?

I had some cookies in the oven
before you came. Stay right there.

Uhm, I really, I shouldn't impose.
No, no, no, I insist.

Mrs. Kersh, are these your family?
Yes dear.

<i>My father came to this country with
fourteen dollars in his pocket.</i>

<i>And he didn't ask for a handout, the
way the people come in here these days.</i>

Do you know what he did?
What did he do, Mrs. Kersh?

<i>My father joined the Circus.</i>

<i>I was always daddy's little girl.</i>

<i>What about you?</i>

<i>Are you still his little girl, Beverly?</i>

<i>Are you?</i>

Don't fool your father!

What? Help!

Run, run, run...

You haven't changed anything yet

You haven't changed your futures.

You, you haven't saved any of them.

Close your eyes, Bev.
Fuck you!

If you don't believe...

Close them.

And see

Yeah

Come on.

Ken, you little bitch.
Yes!

You're fucking good.
Game Over.

Well I gotta go.
Hey uhm...

How about we go again?
Play some more you know?

Only if you want to.

Shut up.
Dude, why are you being weird?

I'm not your fucking boyfriend.

Whoa, I didn't mean...
The fucks going on here?

You assholes didn't tell me your town

is full of little fairies.

Richie Fucking Tozier, wait?

You trying to bone my little cousin?

Get the fuck outta here, Faggot!

Fucking move!


It's not real. (repeating, faster)

I think I just shit my pants.

Marine Festival closing
performance is tonight.

Hope to see you there, handsome.

Did you miss me, Richie?
Fuck!

Cause I missed you.

No one wants to play
with the clown anymore.

Play a game with me, would ya?

How about Street Fighter?
Oh yes, you like that one, don't you?

Or maybe Truth or Dare.
Jesus.

Oh you wouldn't want anyone to pick
truth though would ya, huh Ritchie?

You wouldn't want anyone
to know what you're hiding.

<i>I know your secret</i>

<i>Your dirty little secret...</i>

<i>I know your secret</i>

<i>Your dirty little secret!</i>

Should I tell them, Richie?
this is not real.

This is not real,
this really isn't happening, it isn't real

Come back and play

Come back and play with the clown!

I'm so, so sorry, sorry.

Sorry.

Oh man.
Can I help you?

Yeah, I wanna see about the...

Baseball card?

Bowling ball?

The banjo?

Beaver?
The fucking bike.

If you wanna use that kind of language

Take it out in the street.
Sorry.

Can we start over and pretend
that I just walked in?

How can I help you?

Thank you, yes, I wanna buy the bike.

Aren't you William Denbrough, the writer?
Yes that's me.

That bike? It used to be mine.

Well. It's mine now.

But you're the big author,
so if you want it, you can afford it.

Alright, how much?

$ 300, you can afford it.

I'll get it.
I guess that's kind of a deal.

You, uh, you want me to sign this for you?
Nah, I didn't like the ending.

Three big ones.
All yours.

I don't know how fast you'll go.
Been there a lot of years.

You know what mister,
she's fast enough to beat the Devil.

Come on!

Yeah, I missed you too.

Yeah!

Hi Ho Silver, Away!!!

<i>Hi, Billy.</i>

I know you are down there,
I know you can here me.

There's something I have to know...

Of all the kids in this town you
could have taken, why Georgie?

Say something!

Why him? Why him? WHY HIM?

<i>Why?</i>

<i>Because you weren't there, Billy.</i>

<i>Billy, don't leave.</i>

Hello?

<i>Billy.</i>

<i>I'm still here.</i>

<i>Help me.</i>

Georgie!

Georgie?

<i>Help me, Billy.</i>

Take my hand.

Take my hand, I got you buddy.
He's coming.

Take my hand.
Billy, please, he's coming.

Take my hand. Come on, take my hand.
Billy!

I hate you!

I hate you...

Who are you talking to?

Move, m-m-m-m-move!

You hear voices from that sewer.
You stay away from it.

Do you hear voices from the sewer?
No.

No. Just stay away from that sewer.

I only hear voices in the tub.

You know, from the drain.

What kind of voices?
Kids.

And other times like a...
Clown?

You listen to me, you listen good.
You need to get out of this town.

Alright, tell you parents, make up a reason,
you make up a fucking lie, I don't care

I don't care what you do, get out of this town,
make them never bring you back, you understand?

You leave Derry and you stay out of
Derry, do you understand me?

I'm supposed to be at the Festival.
Tell me you understand!

I'm supposed to be at the
festival, I gotta go.

Just be careful.

Let's get the fuck outta here.

Wake up fat-ass.

Fucking loser.

Whoa, easy. It's just me.

What are you and your little
buddies up to in here?

Oh, those guys are definitely not my buddies.
I meant your real friends.

Joey, Jonathan, Donny and Danny.

Are you smoking in school?
Secret hide out.

Don't tell anyone.

You okay, new kid?
Yeah, no I'm fine.

I guess I'm just worried that...

We're not all gonna be the
same, after the fight.

As long as we can still hang
out, who cares?

You really mean that?

Well yeah of course, dummy.

You and me.

Oh my god!

I meant as a friend.

You actually thought I could like someone
as fat, and gross, and disgusting like you?

No matter how many stupid
(voice changes) poems you write

Your hair is winter fire,

January embers

My heart burns there too.

That's not the real Beverly.
Beverly would never say things like that.

She'd never say that.

Kiss me, fat boy.

Ohhhhh, nobody wants to kiss the fat boy...

Leave me alone.
Oh no?

You'll always be alone.

That is not true. I have real friends.

Bill, Eddie, Mike, Stanley,
Richie and Beverly.

They are my real friends!

Kiss me, as if it were the last time.

What the hell you doing, kid?

Guys?
Hey

Hey

So, what did you see out there?
Something I wish I hadn't.

So what... we just...

We kill IT and then we just
forget everything again?

I hope so, don't you?
I don't know.

I guess I want to hold on
to the good stuff, you know?

I mean come on there must be something
you don't want to forget again.

I remember being scared shitless.
Cold...

I remember you guys in your tightie-whiteys.
Oh, okay, please forget that moment.

I remember this.

I remember the boy who wrote it for me.

Not him so much, but...

How he made me feel.

And a kiss

I don't know, it's still blurry.

But I think the longer we're
here; the more I can see it.

The more I can see that
moment, the more I can see...

Bill

I think.

I don't know, do you remember?

Bev...

Move, move.
What's wrong?

I'm leaving.

What? You can't leave man, we split.
we all die.

Yeah, I'll take my chances,

We're all gonna die anyway.
Rich!

Rich!

The Beaver wishes you good morning.

Today is the last day
of the Marine Festival.

Ow, asshole!

Hello?

Can I help you?
I called in, I had a prescription called in for Kaspbrak.

Kaspbrak.
It's an Inhaler.

Eddie Kaspbrak?
That's me.

I remember you.
Yeah.

How is your mom?
She died a few years ago.

It was very sad, it was from liver cancer.
What's that?

What's what?
That.

Alright. Okay.

It's not gonna pop, it's a mole.
It might not be cancer.

Cancer?

But it might be.

You just stay here, I'll get you something.

Okay.

You came here for your stinky breath pills?

My, my breath is fine, thank you.

That's not what my dad said.

He said you have a tumor.

On your dick.

You don't take pill for...

Wait, what did your dad say?
Here you go.

Hope your dick feels better.

Thank you.

For the inhaler, not the penis, thing.

<i>Eddie!</i>

<i>Eddie Bear!</i>

Mommy?

<i>Eddie Bear!</i>

Mommy?

<i>Eddie, come help me, please.,</i>

Eddie!
Mommy?

Eddie, help me, Eddie, quick help me.

Mommy?
Eddie bear, come help me.

Eddie?
What is he doing here?

What is taking you so long?
What are you doing here?

Mommy.

He's coming,
you have got to get me out of here.

Who's coming?
Eddie.

What the fuck is that?

Mommy.
Eddie, get me out of here. He's gonna kill me.

Eddie

Please help!

Eddie, he's gonna infect me, Eddie.

Help me.

Help me! It's coming, Eddie.

Eddie

He's gonna infect me, Eddie.

Oh my God!

Faster!

Eddie!

I can't do it.

I'm sorry, I can't do it, mom.

I knew you would leave me, Eddie

Help me!

<i>Eddie!</i>

What the hell was she doing here?
Why is that curtain still here?

Alright, Okay, We're gonna do this Eds.

It's just a memory, just a memory.
You'll be fine. Take a breath.

Deep breath.

Okay, you can do it.

No, shit!

No Stop! Fuck!

Take that!

Fuck you!

What the fuck?

Let me out.

What?
Push, don't pull them, moron.

Thanks

Oh my God, what happened to you?
Nothing, I'm fine.

I'm fine, everything is fine.

Hey, how you doing? Where's everybody else?
Richie wants to leave.

Ben's upstairs trying to get him to stay.
I know, he's just scared.

So am I, Bill. Aren't you?

We are all scared, that's what worries me.

Because that's what it wants.

We can do this,
but we have to stick together.

Should we be running?
This is Derry, I'm kinda getting used to it.

<i>You won't be there for him either.</i>

What does that mean?

Shit, it's the kid.
What?

It's the kid, from the
place, the Chinese place.

I saw him on the way here.
He lives in my old house.

He said he was going to the fair.

He's going to the fair,
I've gotta help him.

Okay, okay, listen to me, we'll go
together. I'm gonna get Richie and Ben

And we'll go.
There's no time.

I can't let it happen again.
What happened before, it wasn't your fault.

None of it was.
I wish that were true, Bev.

Bill! Bev!

What is this? What happened?
Did Bill just leave?

I couldn't stop him, everyone's leaving.

It's alright, it's Bill, he'll come back.

At least I got Richie to stay.

Fuck!

And then the leper,
he threw up all over me.

Eds, Mike Hanlon,
why don't you come back to Maine?

It's your time, Eddie.

What?

Why did you do this?

Because he says it's your time.
Who said it's my time?

You know, Eddie. You know

It is time to float.

Where did you go?

Now give me back my fucking knife!

You need to cut that fucking mullet,
it's been like fucking 30 years, man.

Guys!

Shit.

Eds?

Jesus, Ed! What the hell?

Bowers is in my room.

Is it bad?

I'm gonna carve my whole name
onto this cottage cheese.

Stop!

One dead. Fuck yeah!!!

Hey!!!

Hey Kid! Kid!

Sorry. Hey!

Excuse me, hey, hey!

Fuck!

Fuck!

Kid, hey, kid...

Kid...

Fuck!

Fuck...

Kid? Hey!

Kid.

Kid! Hey hey!

Hey...

Awww fuck...

Shit.

Hey.
What are you doing here?

I'm here to help.
Stop following me!

I'm gonna get,
I'm gonna get you outta here.

No

Please!

I'm here now, just take me.

No, son of a bitch!

Motherfucker!

Help!

NO!

I should go back there.

I just lucking left them in a lurch.
I should go back there.

What the fuck are you doing?
No fuck that, fuck them.

I've got date in fucking Reno, man.

<i>Amen.</i>

Reflecting on the meaning
of what I just read,

the word "meshane" comes up a lot,

which means " to change /to transform".

Which makes sense I guess because,
today I am supposed to become a man

<i>It's funny though</i>

<i>Everyone, I think, has some memories...</i>

<i>They're prouder of than others, right?</i>

<i>And maybe that's why
the change is so scary.</i>

<i>Cause the things we wish
we could leave behind.</i>

Good morning, Mike.
How are you doing?

<i>The whispers we wish we could silence...</i>

It's possibly,
he's the one that set that fire.

<i>The nightmares we most
want to wake up from.</i>

<i>The memories we wish we could change</i>

<i>Secrets, we feel like we have to keep...</i>

<i>Are the hardest to walk away from...</i>

<i>The good stuff...</i>

<i>The pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest...</i>

<i>Those pieces of you that
feels the easiest to loose...</i>

<i>Maybe I don't want to forget...</i>

Maybe... If that's what
today is all about...

Forget it, right?
Thank you, Stanley.

Today, I'm supposed to become a
man, but I don't feel any different

I know I'm a loser. And no matter what...

I always fucking will be.

Thanks for showing up, Stanley.

Help! Mike, please help us!

Mikey, please.
Call for help.

Mikey, help us!

You should have burned, Mike.

Just like your druggie parents.

Can you see them yet?

Crispy... like fried fucking chicken

Guess you could say that was long overdue.
You get it? Because we are in a library.

Mike!

Oh my god!

You're alriight?
No, I'm not alright, I just fucking killed a guy.

I was talking to Mike.

Where's Bill?

Bill, we're at the library, where you at?

It's the little kid, he killed the
little kid right in fucking front of me.

No, no, no, no, look, just come here to
the library. We can help with a plan.

I'm going to kill it.
No, no, no, no

I don't want any of you to get killed with me.
Bill!

He's gonna fight it alone.
What?

Alone.

It's about the group, the ritual doesn't work without
the group. Doing it together is why it worked.

Mike, did he tell you where he was going?

If he really wanted to kill Pennywise,
there's only one place he'll go.

The same place the ritual
needs to be performed.

Oh, we're not gonna like this, are we?

Fuck!

Bill!
No.

No, no you guys, no

I started all this.
It is my fault that you are all here.

This curse, this fucking
thing that's inside of you all

It started growing the day that I
made you all go down in the barrens

Because all I cared about
was finding Georgie.

Now, I'm gonna go in there and
I don't know what's gonna happen

But I can't ask you to do this.

We're not asking you either.
We didn't do it alone then, Bill.

So we're not gonna do this alone now.
Losers stick together.

So does somebody wanna say something?

Richie said it best, when we where here last.
I did?

I don't want to die?
Not that.

You're lucky we're not measuring dicks?

No

Let's kill this fucking clown?
Yeah.

Let's kill this fucking clown!

Well, I love what he's done with the place.
Beep, beep, Richie.

Hey, hey, hey, that's the basement, right?

Ben!

Damn it, no!
Ben!

Ben!

Ben, what's wrong?

Ben!

Ben!

That can't be good, right?

Help! Hey!

It's Stan.

It can't be real.

Jesus Christ!

I'd still be alive,
if it wasn't for you, Bill.

No

Beverly!

Richie, what's happening to me?

You gotta be fucking kidding.

Shit!

Get off of me!

Eddie, are you okay?

Aw, there he is.

Get it off.

Get it off me!

Richie!

Guys!

I wanna to go home

Get the knife!

God damn it, Eddie, get the knife!
Take it off, please!

Eddie, get the knife!

What?

Is everyone okay?

You alright?

You could have fucking died, man.
You know that?

Georgie is dead,
the kid's dead and Stanley's dead.

You want Richie too?

Do you want Richie too?
(repeating) I don't

Please don't be mad, Bill.

I was just scared

That, that's what he wants.

So, don't give it to him.

A lot of memories, huh?

All bad.

Oh man!

Gray water.

Shit, this is it.

This is were it happened.

No, no, no, no, no...

Bevvie

Bev, what is it?

I thought I heard something.

Bev!
Time to sink.

Bev!

Guys?

Ok guys, come on.

Hey guys? Guys come on, please...

walk out of here alone.

Thank you.
You okay?

I feel like crying.
Mike, where do we go from here?

From the depths, is where it crashed.
Beneath we find relief. (repeats)

Is he okay?
I think at this point, that's a relevant question.

What's on the other side?
I don't know, no one does.

Mike!

Alright, see you there.
Mike!

Stay together.
Okay.

You guys I can't do it.

I can't, you saw what happened up there.
I was gonna let you die.

I just fucking froze up. You let me go down
there with you, I'm gonna get us all killed.

Give me that, give me that, give
me, Richie, let go, you little turd.

Just let me...

I got it.
Stop. Listen to me...

You had a moment, fine, but who killed a
psychotic clown before he was fourteen?

Me.

Who stabbed Bowers with a knife
that he pulled out of his own face?

Also me.

Who married a woman ten
times his own body mass?

Me.
Yeah.

You're braver than you think.
I don't think so, Richie.

Ow.
Sorry

Here, take it. It kills monsters.

Does it?
Yeah, if you believe it does.

Thanks, Bev.

You guys good?
Yeah.

You fit through there?
It's the only way, this way.

It's in here. It's through here,
it's tight, but you can get through.

It's where it hid.

So all of this was under Derry...

Like forever?
No, not forever.

Just a few billion years.

IT can only be attacked in IT's true form.

The ritual will show us.
What is IT's true form?

I hope it's a puppy, Pomeranian.
I'll shut up.

It's light...

Light that must be snuffed out by darkness.

Your artifacts, place them in the fire.

The past must burn with the present.

This is the boat that I built...

with Georgie

My inhaler

Come on, dude.

Something that I wish I held on to.

This is a page from my yearbook.
Only one person signed it.

I probably should have forgotten it...

But I couldn't.
Because I kept it in my wallet

For 27 years.

This is a token from the Capital Theater.
You brought an actual token?

Yeah, that's what we were supposed to do, asshole..
Do you have any idea how long it's gonna take to burn?

Yeah, but so is your inhaler, dude.
Guys, come on.

The toxic fumes and plastic and shit. So?

Look closely Bev. You see it?

It's where you hit Bowers.
The rock fight.

The day these bonds were forged.
That's not gonna burn either.

Oh, wait

Can't be without Stan, again.

Okay, grab hands, come on.

The ritual of the ChÃ¼d
its a battle of wills.

The first step was our reunion.

The second was to gather the tokens.

This is the final step.

What the?

What the fuck is that?
Don't look at it. Don't look

The dead lights.
Don't look at them.

Okay.
Turn the light into darkness (repeats). Say it!

What?
Say it!

Turn the light into darkness!

Turn the light into darkness!

Turn the light into darkness!
Mike, what's happening, man?

Keep chanting!

Turn the light into darkness!

Turn the light into darkness!

Keep chanting!

Turn the light into darkness!
Is it working, did we do it?

What is this? Is this part of it?

Mike, is this supposed to be happening?
Keep chanting.

What?
Keep chanting.

Turn the light into darkness.
Come on, light into dark.

Continue, it's working.

Hey, hey!

Shit.

Move, move.

Bev

You okay?
I can't hear shit, I can't hear shit.

You alright?
Yeah, no, no, no. no.

Where's Mike?
Mike!

Mike!
Mike!

I'm here. Alright guys.
Did we do it?

Did we do it, did we do it.
We put the tokens in the thing.

That's good, right? We did it, right?

Shit!
Ooooh Did it work, Mikey?

Did it work? (laughing)

Tell them why your silly
little ritual didn't work.

Tell them it's all just ...what's the word?

Placebo?

Mike, what's he talking about?
Mikey?

Mikey, you never showed
them the fourth side, right?

You didn't want them to know what actually happened
to the poor Shakopee. Aw dum, dum dum dum.

Fuck Mikey, you lied to us again?
No.

They didn't, they didn't believe that it would
kill him. that's why it didn't work back then.

Are you fucking kidding, Mike? Fuck!

Fuck you, Mikey!

I needed something. Anything we were supposed
to remember, we were supposed to believe.

Fuck!
Shit!

The dead lights. Don't look at them.

27 years, I dreamt of you.

I craved you

Oh I missed you...

Mike, back off!

I waited for this very moment.

Move, Mikey.
Sorry.

I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
It's time to float.

Shit!
Sorry.

Wake up, Mike. Get him up, get him up.

Shit!

Come on, come on, come on!

Bill!

Go! Go! Go!

Where's Bill?
Don't worry, we'll find a way out.

Aw shit, can he see us?

He sees us!

Oh shit!

Run for your life!
Shit!

Shit, you're kidding.

Where do we go?

No!

Damn it. -uh, uh,
not scary at all, alright?

No, they're flipped. He's fucking with us.

Are you sure?

Trust me.
Positive. - Yes

Where's my shoe?

You told me to trust you!!

He's not fucking with us,
let's go to not scary at all.

Okay.

It's alright, let's go.

Shit.

No way am I falling for this shit again.
Oh yeah, that thing's a fucking monster.

We should make it sit.
I know your moves, you little bitch.

Richie, it's gone man.
Yes, okay, wait.

It's okay.

Sit!
It did it.

Aww, that's cute, - That's a good boy.

That's a good boy.

Shit, next time we just go regular scary.

Next time?

I lost it, Billy.

It just floated off

I'm not mad at you

It's your fault, what happened, isn't it?

You weren't really that
sick that morning, were you?

No, I just...

Pretending because I didn't
want to play with you.

I just didn't want to

You lied and I died.

You lied and I died.

You lied and I died! (repeating)

It happened because of me Georgie, me.

You lied and I died!

You little shit, I can smell you!

You smell just like Lois Lane.

Here's Johnny...

All that success. All those sit-ups.

But deep down you're still just
a little fat, fat, fatty loser.

You always knew you would die alone.

Nooooo!

Slut!
Help!

Beverly!

Bevy, just open up the door for me. okay?

Beverly, can you hear me?
No!

Come to Daddy, now.
Bev, don't listen!

Bev!
Are you still my little girl, Bevy?

Beverly, I love you!
Ben?

Are you still my little girl, Bevy?

Are you still my little girl?
Not anymore.

Your hair is winter fire,

January embers.

My heart...
Ben!

My heart...
Ben!

Ben!

Bev!

Ben!

January embers.
My heart burns there too.

It was you.

You deserve to die.
No.

You were the best big
brother there ever was.

No! We killed our little brother!

He loved you.

And just because you didn't
want to play on a rainy day...

Just one time...

Does not make it your fault.

It never...

ever...

IT

Bill

Miss me?

I know what you are,
that's why I'm not afraid

I know what you are

A madman.

Stop!

Hey, fuckface!

Do you want to play Truth or Dare?
Here's the truth...

You're a sloppy bitch. Yeah, that's right.

Let's Dance! Yippee ki-yay mother...

This kills monsters.
If you believe it does...

If you believe it does.

If you believe it does.

If you believe it does!

Beep beep, motherfucker!

Holy shit.

Rich! No! Rich!

Hey Rich, wake up!

Hey, yeah, there he is, buddy.

Richie, listen, I think I got 'em man.

I think I killed IT, I did,
I think I killed IT for real...

Noooooooo!

Eddie

Richie...

Richie...
No!

Noooo!

Eddie

Eddie!

Eddie!

It hurts

Eddie!
It hurts

It hurts.
Come on man.

Be careful, be careful.

Come out and play, losers.

He's hurt really bad,
we gotta get him out of here.

And how are we supposed to do that, Richie?

I almost killed IT, the leper.

My hands around his throat.

I could feel IT choking.
I made him small...

He seemed so weak... he seemed... so weak

The Shakopee

All living things must abide the
laws of the shape they inhabit.

Guys, there's a passageway, through here

The tunnel,
Pennywise has to make himself small

to get through the entrance
of the cavern, right?

So if we can get back there,
we can force him back down to size

Yes.

We make him small, small
enough, so we can kill him.

I can smell the stink of your fear.

Let's go.
Here, it's tight, It's tight. Be careful.

I need a little rest...

Richie, I appreciate that, I gotta tell you something.
What's up, buddy?

I fucked your mother.

Go, go!

Come on!

I got you!
No!

No!
You filthy little children.

You got a plan B. What the hell we're going to do now?
You will die, that's you do.

Mike?

There's more than one way
to make someone small.

Make him believe that he is.
What?

Make him believe that he is.
Oh, me? Small? (laughing)

I am the eater of worlds.
Not to us. You're not.

You're just a clown.

You're a weak old woman.

Eater of worlds!
A headless boy.

Impostor!

You are a mimic! A mimic!

You are a fucking bully!

You're just a fucking clown!
A dumb fucking clown!

Clown!

Fraud!

Clown!

Cheater!
Clown!

A motherfucking stupid mummy!

You're a clown!

Clown!

You're a clown!

Stupid clown

You're a lowly clown motherfucker.
Devourer of worlds.

Clown.

You're just a clown.
I am a eater of worlds.

Clown!

Stupid clown!

Clown!

Imposter.

Clown!

Clown.

A clown with a scared beating heart...

Look at you

You're all grown up...

Eddie!

Hey Ed, we got Pennywise, man.

Eddie?

Richie.
He's gone.

He's alright, he's hurt,
we just gotta get him out of here.

He's hurt, Ben.

No, he's okay,
we have to get him out of here, Bev.

Richie...

What?
I, I think he's dead.

We have to go, come on, come on, Richie.
We have to go.

Come on buddy. Let's go.

We have to go.

Wait guys. We can still help him!

Let him go.
Guys, we can still help him!

No, Eddie! Eddie!

Come on!

Fast!

Move!

Move, move!

Run!

Eddie!

We have to help him, he's still in there!

Eddie!

You know what?
Eddie would've hated this, guys.

What? Cleaning ourselves in dirty water?
Yes.

He would be telling us that
we'd get streptocockle-something

Yeah. But he would've made us laugh though.
Yeah.

He'd be looking out for us.
The way he always was.

Isn't that right, Richie?

Hey...

Thank you.

I don't have my glasses on, so I don't
know who you people are, but thank you.

I really can't find my glasses.
You're serious?

Glasses?
They were around here somewhere.

I can't see them.
Oh I see them right there.

Where?
Look, if you just go like...

Does anybody have any luck...

Hey guys... Look.

Nothing lasts forever.

I can't go home like this
guys, my mom will kill me.

Dude, you've been gone for
like 24 straight hours.

Your face is definitely
on a milk carton by now.

Also that puke smells worse
than your mom's slippers

Shut up, Richie.

First of all, my mom's slippers
smell like potpourri, asshole.

No they don't.

Yes they do, and also how would you know what they smell like in the first place.
Can we just keep it quiet?

There's potpourri all
over my bathroom. -Eddie

Potpourri is literally a
French word for a rotten pot.

Mike?
Hey.

I just thought I'd check up on you.

You know, just to see, if you'd
learn how to finish a book for once.

I just finished the first chapter.

And I think, I actually know
where I'm going this time.

Good.
Say can I ask you a question?

<i>Sure.</i>

Why do you think we're not
forgetting, you know, like last time?

Maybe because IT's dead.

Or maybe because we have more that
we want to remember than we want

to forget.
I like that one.

You decided what you wanted to do?
About leaving Derry?

Man I've been in this town for 27 years.
Just staying where it wanted me to.

I think it's time I saw
the sky for a change.

<i>Go get it, Mikey.</i>

Did you get the letter?
What letter?

You'll know when you see it...

Hold on, I just got the mail.
We all got one.

Patricia Uris?
Just... just read it.

Okay.
And call me, anytime.

Come on.
Bill.

I love you man.
I love you too.

<i>Alright, see you.</i>

<i>Dear losers,</i>

<i>I know what this must seem like,
but this isn't a suicide note.</i>

<i>You're probably wondering
why I did what I did</i>

<i>It was because I knew I
was too scared to go back.</i>

<i>And if we weren't together</i>

<i>If all of us, alive, weren't united</i>

<i>Then, we would all die.</i>

<i>So, I made the only logical move</i>

<i>I took myself off of the board.</i>

<i>Did it work?</i>

<i>Well if you're reading
this, you know the answer.</i>

<i>I've lived my whole life, afraid.</i>

<i>Afraid of what would come next</i>

<i>Afraid of what I might leave behind</i>

<i>Don't.</i>

<i>Be who you want to be.</i>

<i>And be proud.</i>

You sleep okay?
Yeah

I had a beautiful dream.

<i>And if you find someone worth holding onto</i>

<i>Never, ever let them go.</i>

<i>Follow your own path.</i>

<i>Wherever that takes you</i>

<i>Think of this letter as a promise</i>

<i>A promise I am asking you to make... To me</i>

<i>To each other</i>

<i>An oath.</i>

<i>You see the thing about being a loser is...</i>

<i>You don't have anything to lose</i>

<i>So...</i>

<i>Be true.</i>

<i>Be brave.</i>

<i>Stand.</i>

<i>Believe.</i>

<i>And don't ever forget...</i>

<i>We're losers</i>

<i>And we always will be...</i>
