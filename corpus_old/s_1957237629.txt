[phone ringing]

Jim?

Jim?

Jim!

What did you party too hard?

[Jim exhales]

Oh!

What is that?

Make it stop. [whimpers]

[footsteps shuffling]

Ma?

[creepy music]

[upbeat rock music]

Dude, just make an
appointment already.

No, no, no, no.
[Alyson chuckles]

Why the fuck you gotta
make it such a big thing?


I just, I just,
needles, I don't like 'em.

Okay so like tattoos,
piercings also out of the question?

Hmm?, Square Boy?

Yeah. Not happening.

Why?

Are you a little
conformist? [chuckling]

Wow. Hey, Alyson.

My body is a temple.

Oh, are you saying
my body's not a temple?

And be.

[Alyson chuckling]

It's not just the needles, okay?

I have a thing with blood,
especially my blood.

Dude.
Jim.

No big fucking deal.

You just look away.

You don't gotta watch.
Mm-hmm.

Nah.

I get all like
woozy and shit too

from all the blood loss.

No dude.
No, yeah.

That's why they give
you the cookies.

I saw that on episode
of "The Simpsons."

Jim, just some advice,

maybe don't use "The Simpsons"
as a rough guide to life.

[both chuckling]

Exactly. Girl's on point.

Whatever, y'all.

There are other
ways to make money.

Oh my God.

Lots of, I'm thinking.

Yeah. Okay.

You go get that bag, player.

I'm gonna roll another joint.

Ooh, look at this.

House sitting.

House sitting?
[Alyson chuckles]

Yeah. Looks like
pretty nice place.

Looks like a job for
a 12 year old girl.

How much does it pay?

Um, wow. A hundred
bucks a night.

Ooh, wow.

Plasma donors get 80
bucks a donation, dude.

And it's like a couple hours.

It's some old lady's place.

It's pretty close to here.

Do you think I
should email them?

Where are my goddamn papers?

[Alyson chuckles]

Hmm.

What do you think?

It could be cool. Easy way
to make some cash, I guess.

So should I hit 'em up?

Sure, dude.

Maybe you could party
somewhere else for once.

Jesus-goddamn-
motherfucking-Christ.

I gotta have some in the car.

[Jim sighs]
[Alyson chuckles]

[keyboard clattering]

Hmm. [chuckling]

What?
Nothing.

It's just cute that
you're squeamish.

And just don't like the
idea of losing pints of blood.

God. It's not pints.

[upbeat rock music]

You're so funny.

You better write that email
before someone else gets on it.

Yeah.

All right, baby.

Now we're cooking with gas.

[wrapper crinkling]

Dude, oh my God.
What?

It doesn't matter.
You're dropping everything.

Shut up.
Stop.

Shut up.
What?

Chill.

[Alyson chuckling]

closing as the train departs.

Please hold on.

[ominous music]

[train whirring]

[ominous music]

Probably need you
a couple of nights,

coming back Sunday,
maybe Monday, latest.

Just kind of depends
how she's doing.

Right, Ma?

Christ.

So yeah.

Just need you to stay here.

Ma's a little paranoid
about prowlers.

I've heard plenty.

You got any questions?

Um, yeah.

So basically you just
want me to stay here?

He doesn't have to stay here.

He doesn't want to.

Yes.

There's a guest room upstairs.
Used to be mom's room.

Have it set up by Friday.


That gonna work for ya?

He doesn't have to stay
here if he doesn't want to.

Ma, I am doing what I
can to ease your mind here.

You are not making it easy.

My own son yelling
at his mother.

You're good to your
mother, aren't you?

That's the whole point, Ma.

That he stay here.

I just wish the good
Lord would take me now.

Ma.

Ma, where are you going?

Can I even take a piss
without you hounding me?

Hmm.

Her health hasn't been good.

My sister was watching
her for a while, eh.

Well we think she
took off last week.

Oh, I'm sorry.

That sucks.

Yeah.

I can't say I blame her.

She's been going on about
people in the house,

coming up the stairs.

You know, I don't know
if her head's right.

You know?
Right.

So...

So, you know,
should be pretty easy.

Nothing, you know, you gotta do.

Just, you know, if you get bored

and you wanna have some
friends over keep you company,

feel free.
Okay.

Cool.
Just no smoking.

All right?
Oh, yeah, no.

No drugs.
No, of course.

You a weed smoker?
Me?

No, no, not at all.

Good. Shit makes you lazy.

Yeah.
And stupid.

You know I don't
like you smoking.

I know, Ma.

Oh, boy.

So what do you say, kid?

Are you gonna watch
this old bird's house

for the weekend or what?

Yeah, I mean, sure.

Great. Settled.

See it all worked out.

Mm, I think if that's it,

I'm just gonna call a ride or

No, I can drop you
something.

somewhere in town
on my way back.

Oh, you don't have to do that.

Yeah, no, I insist.

Just give me a sec.

[ominous music]

I'm not as senile as
he makes me out to be.

And I'm not afraid of someone
breaking into the house,

I'm afraid of what's
already in the house.

Mrs. Marina.
And if you stay here,

you'll hear it too.

[ominous music]

[footsteps bang]
[door opens]

[door closes]

Yo, Auntie E, what's shaking?

[ominous music]


Yo, y'all got anything
good to eat in here?

I'm starving.

Hey man, I didn't see you there.

Kinda quiet.

Yeah, sorry.

Lost in thought.

My grandnephew, Alex.

That's me. Your boy.

Say, I'll tell you what, man,

you must be that guy
they got watching,

watching the house for
the weekend there, huh?

Uh, yeah. I guess I am.

Yeah, they couldn't
get me to do it.

Why?

What's wrong with
this place, dude?

Dude, it's fine.
Nothing's wrong.

It's, I'm just going away
with the boys to Vegas

for the weekend, that's all.

Chill.
Oh.

Oh, right.

Oh, before I forget,
Hey Auntie Eunie.

You're good with that, that
thing we talked about, right?

Everything all
good with what thing?

Well?

What's this thing?

Mm, nothing really.

Shit, Uncle Tony,
it's been a minute.

You're looking pretty
smooth though, man.

You put on what like
50 pounds or something?

Why are you here, shit stain?

'Cause I wanted to
come by and say hey

to my favorite relatives.

That's fucking
why. Come on, man.

So you can raid our fridge

and be a general
freaking nuisance?

Is that why?

Well there's nothing like
some quality family time

but I gotta get going, so...

Yeah, you can say that again.


Sorry about that.

You ready to go?

Yeah, no worries.

Cool. Let's hit it.

[ominous music]

[door closes]

Man, that is some
spooky shit, bro.

I know, right?
I don't think I'd do it.

[hard rock music]

Mm, yeah, I already
told them I would, so.

Well take Grandma's advice,

"Stay home, fake it.

Easy money."

Is it weird that I
kind of just wanna see

what she's talking about?

Yeah, it is.

Well like she's
gotta be senile, right?

I don't know, man.

Here.

Thank you.

Like what's the worst
that could happen?


You get butt
fucked by a demon.

Like seriously, that scene
out of "Deliverance."

That's you.

A literal hell spawn
comes up out of the floor

and drags you to a
fiery pit of agony

for all eternity.

Or you know, you get shot
in the face by a prowler.

Mm.

I'm too high for shit shit.


[hard rock music]

I'm serious.

You should bail.

I can't.

There's better ways to
get that cheddar, dog.

I...

When I say I'm gonna do
something, I'm gonna do it.

Come hell or high water, so.


Here.

[phone vibrating]

I don't think it'll be that bad.

I mean, it's pretty big
place to have to myself.

You and Alyson oughta
come by one night.

Yeah, probably swing that.

Protect you from that old girl.

Oh my God!

Wine me, dine me, 69 me.

Take a look at that.

Nice.

Yup.

I thank the good Lord every
day that I was born handsome

and not rich.

You think she'd be okay
with you showing me that?

She wouldn't care.

Really?

'Cause a lot of girls
would call you an asshole.

Well, Alyson ain't most girls.

Besides, I don't give two shits

what any dumb fuck
thinks about me, brother.

Okay.

What time is it?

I don't know.

[hard rock music]

Wanna roll another?

What are you, the mentalist?

Yeah and your
future looks stoned.

[both chuckle]

Yeah, it does.

Where's my papers?

[ominous music]

All right, you ready to go?


That's the spirit.

Hey, thanks again
for doing this, huh.

Yeah, no sweat.

All right, Ma. Let's go.

Drive safe.

Okay.

[ominous music]


[water flowing]
[dishes clacking]

Jim?

Hello?

Hey, Dad.


Hey, is everything okay?

Jim?

Yeah.

I'm, I'm good.

I just

wanted to call and
see how you were doing

Well, everything's fine.

So how are you
liking it up there?

It's nice.

Pretty.

[ominous music]

How's Caitlin?

She's well.

Back in school now.

She seems to be adjusting.

Okay.

Hey look, I'm really sorry
that I haven't called.

It's just

I've looking for work and

with everything that
happened, I just...

It's okay, Jim

We don't have to
rehash this right now.

So, work?

Yeah.

I'm kind of house
sitting right now.

I found it off a website.

It's pretty good money.


Well that sounds like something.

Yeah.

Hey, um.

I was wondering if
you'd be willing

to send me a little money?

Just until my next paycheck.

Okay.

When's your next paycheck?

Um...

I guess I don't actually know.

But I'll pay you back.

You don't have to pay me back.

But you can do me a favor.

Okay.

Call your sister
once in a while.

She really misses you.

I know.

I will.

I love you, son. We love you.

I...

Okay, the money should
be in your account now.

Thanks.

I'll, I'll talk to you soon.

And say hi to Kim for me.

I will.

Okay.

Bye, son.

Bye.

[ominous music]

[door creaking]


calling Galactic Pizza.

Can I interest you in
some of our Saturn bread?

Um, no, thank you. Not today.

[body slithering]
[suspenseful music]

I get started for you, sir?

Can I get a medium
galactic meat lovers...

meat lovers pizza?

Yeah, intergalactic
meat lovers pizza.


intergalactic meat lovers pizza.

Is that gonna be
everything for you?

Yep.

[suspenseful music]

be cash, debit or credit?

[object banging]

Sir? Hello?

[suspenseful music]

[distorted whispering]

[upbeat music on TV]
[group chattering]

[suspenseful music on TV]

[woman screaming]

[Jim gasps]

[ominous music]

[Jim gasps]

[suspenseful music]
[footsteps thumping]

[Jim gasping]

[intense music]

[fork clinking]

Mom, do you want any
sour cream in your eggs?

[ominous music]

Mom?

Mom?
Uh-huh.

Hi.

Would you like some
sour cream in your eggs?

Oh, yeah

Yeah, sure, honey.

Are you doing okay?

Oh, I think I'm just tired.

I didn't sleep so
good last night.

You seem a little off.

Well I've been
having nightmares.

Nightmares, huh?

Yeah, it's the same
thing over and over.

[ominous music]

It's so strange.

I'm awoken every night
by someone walking

slowly up the stairs.

And the footsteps are so strong,

they vibrate the
walls of my room.

And I get out of bed

and I go over to the
banister and I look over,

and there's this thing
walking slowly up the stairs.

And I run back to my
room and shut the door.

[door closes]

And then I wake up.

Hmm. You wonder
what that's about.

What do you mean?

Well, dreams are
kind of like an insight

into your subconscious, right?

It could be something that
you're not dealing with.

Like stress, anxiety,
I mean, resentment.

Resent what?
Mom, I don't know.

They're your dreams.

I'm just saying that
sometimes dreams

can be like a
metaphor for things

you're not dealing with.

Oh, for God sake.

Does everything have to be

a psychological
disorder these days?

They're just fears.

I had them since I
was a little girl.

Mom, I don't know.

Maybe it's something
you're not dealing with.

nearly a 70 year old woman.

I live alone.

I'm afraid, I'm afraid
something's gonna happen to me,

and I won't be able
to protect myself.

Oh, Mom.

I'm right down the street.

You can call me at any time
and I'll be right over.

Oh.

Mom, I love you.

I love you too, sweet pea.

[lightning striking]
[rain pattering]

[ominous music]

[door knob clattering]

[ominous music]

[ambient music from TV]

Cries?

In the night.

Dead people don't cry.

[breathes heavily]

[footsteps thumping]
[Eunice gasping]

[intense music]

[distorted whispering]

[distorted groaning]


[birds chirping]

[ominous music]

Mm. Hey, hey.

You and Alyson wanna drop by
the old lady's house tonight?

[all laughing]

the Hunchback Nostradamus,

he predicted it.
No, it was

just Nostradamus.
That's what I said.

No, it was not a hunchback.

That guy's from Notre Dame.

I saw it on the
History Channel.

I know. We
watched it together.

He wasn't a hunchback?

No.

Nostradamus.
Yeah.

Predicted 9/11.
Yes.

It's a historical fact, bro.

Is it?

Is it a historical fact.

Yeah. He predicted all sorts
of things that came to pass,

like World War II, the rise
and fall of the Roman Empire,

the Kennedy assassination.

And he was the
one who figured out

that Count Dracula
was into dudes.

[soft rock music]

Dudes.

Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

"I vant to suck your cock."


Wasn't Nostradamus
just like some old dude

from Shakespeare times?

How could he have predicted

an assassination of a president

who wasn't a president yet

in a country that
wasn't a country yet.

That old dude was
an oracle genius, bro.

Look. All right.

This is what he
predicted about 9/11.

"Volcanic fire from
the center of the earth

will cause trembling
around the new city.

Two great rocks will
make war for a long time.

In the year 1999 in the
seventh month from the sky

will come the great
king of terror,

bringing back to life the
great king of the Mongols

before and after it
reigned by good fortune.

Okay.

9/11 was in 2001.

Oh my God.

September.

It's the ninth month.

Not the seventh, you know, 9/11.

Fuck you, bro.

Bush wasn't a King.

You don't know.

And he damn sure
wasn't mongolian.


I'm gonna tell you something.

Can you get me out of here
[indistinct mumbling].

gotta ruin everything?

People just, they get on
my nerves with this whole

ignorant thing.
Okay, damn.

What are you like
the no fun police?

Where's you sense
of imagination?

I don't have a problem
imagining just believing.

Isn't it more fun to believe?

I mean, I guess.

But in my experience,

the logical answer's
usually correct

You wanna go outside
and smoke a joint?

Yeah.

Wait, I need another beer.

Really?

That doesn't drive
me to drink already?

I am an independent
woman, Jim.

I can drive myself.

Okay.

[soft rock music]

[rain pattering]

[lightning striking]

[creepy music]

[Alyson chuckling]

Whoa. That much?

Slow down, Cheech
and Chong. [chuckles]

What?

Roll a mountain bike, no a
road bike, you fucking waste.

You know, that mouth of yours

could give the wrong impression.

Mama said that might happen.


You ever shotgun?
No.

Do you know what that is?

Yeah, I saw it on
a documentary once

on some like Vietnam thing.


Yeah, I mean one guy has
a shotgun and he blows smoke

through it to another guy.

Is that why they call it that?

Hmm.
I mean, I guess.

Well I've never
done that either.

Come here.

[soft music]
[rain pattering]

Sorry.

For what?

He's right there.

guy code telling you

it's not okay to fuck
your friend's girl?

He's right there.

You're right. Sorry.

Are you mad?
No.

I just think it's about
time that I go wake up

my drunk-ass boyfriend
so I can take him home

and fuck his brains out.

[lightning striking]

Come on.

Baby, I'm tired.
Mm-hmm.

Let's go.
Mm.

Okay.

Ready?

Okay.

I guess we're heading out.

Catch you on the
flippity-flop, Jimbo.

All right, let's go.

[door closes]

[ominous music]

What the fuck did
I get myself into?

[crickets chirping]

[thunder rumbling]

[lightning striking]

[footsteps thumping]

[suspenseful music]

[intense music]




[birds chirping]

[ominous music]

Mrs. Marina?

I didn't realize you were home.

[intense music]

[record scratching]

So is Tony outside, or...

My phone must be on silent.

[suspenseful music]

[tooth squishing]

Mrs. Marina?

Is everything okay?

[suspenseful music]

[intense music]

I went to be at
10:30 last night.

But I didn't really sleep.


[creepy breathing]

[ominous music]

[water flowing]


[intense music]

Holy shit.

[footsteps thumping]

You gotta be kidding me.

[suspenseful music]
[footsteps thumping]

Wake up.

Wake up, wake up, wake
up, wake up, wake up,

wake up, wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up, wake up.

[intense music]

Jesus Christ, this
is dated from June.

Aren't you're supposed to
be taken care of the mail?

I bring in.

I don't go through it.

What do you care anyways?

Okay. God.

Sorry for trying to help.

Oh, is that what you're doing?

It really just seems like
you're busting my balls.

I'm just saying, Don.

She needs a little
more help these days.

Oh really?

Last time I checked,

I'm the only one
that's here every day.

That is bullshit, Donna.

I work damn near 50 hours
a week and you know it.

Ma and I are doing just fine.

Aren't we, Ma?

[birds chirping]

She hasn't eaten a thing.


I don't know if she
had another nightmare.

She just seems exhausted.

Nightmare?
Mm-hmm.

Hmm.

[ominous music]

What's wrong, Ma?

You haven't touched your food.

I'm afraid I'm
just not very hungry.

You need to try and
eat a little something.

What's the matter?
Didn't you sleep good?

I had a nightmare, I think.

It was like there was
someone in the house.

In your dream?

I think so.

I don't know.

Is it the one that
you told me about?

The one that shakes the walls?

Yeah.

It's like there's
someone in the house

and they're coming
up the stairs.

I went to bed at 10:30,

but I didn't really sleep.

Better call Dr. Yang.

Could be a side effect
to your medication.

Tony, it's not the meds.

I'm not crazy.

Hey, hey, hey, no one
says you were crazy.

We're just trying to help.

Well, if you wanna help me,

get me a big guard dog or a gun.

What, so you can take
pot shots through the walls

every time you hear a noise?

Ma, there's gotta be
something going on here.

It could be something
with your meds,

maybe something else.

Oh, for God sake, Tony.

I'm not fruit loops.

I know you're not, Ma.

That's why I wanna check
in with your doctor.

We'll talk it out
later, all right?

All right, bye.

Hey, Tony.

Hey, Tony.

I'm really sorry I
snapped at you earlier.

Don't sweat it.

[ominous music]

I'm really stressed out
about this whole thing.

I mean, she was fine one moment

and then it just
seems like she's not,

and I don't know if
it's depression or-

Look, you're trying hard.

We all see it.

I'm sorry I gave you shit
about the mail, all right?

Tony, I don't give
a fuck about the mail.

I just...

Do you think she's
gonna be okay?

I wish I could say.

I just don't know
what to do anymore.

Yeah.

It may be time she
saw that specialist.

[door closes]

Fuck.

[ominous music]

I need protection.

What?

I said, I need protection.

I don't feel safe.

Mom, we'll do
whatever it takes.

Don't worry. We'll
get an alarm system.

We'll bar up the windows.

I've got you.
I need to be able

to do something.

You can do something.

You can call me at any time

and I'll be right over.

You know that.
I'm scared.

Oh, Mom, you don't have to be.

I've got you.

Do you?

Yes, of course.

How about this?

I'll come over right before
bed and just you and I

can go through the
house and make sure

it's all nice and
tight, locked up.

No offense, Donna, but
I'd rather have a gun.

[intense music]
[crickets chirping]

[ominous music]

[lock clicks]

[suspenseful music]

[distorted whispering]

[footsteps thumping]


[suspenseful music]

[footsteps thumping]


[intense music]


[birds chirping]

[haunting music]

Hey.

Can we meet?

[haunting music]
[rain pattering]

[indistinct chattering]

[chess piece bangs]

[ominous music]

Jim.

Jim!

Hey.

[indistinct chattering]

[haunting music]

[wine trickling]

Donna?

Is that the daughter
that took off?

Yep.

Hmm.

I guess she just got
sick of the crazy old broad

and just left.

Mm, God. Talk about loyalty.

Who does something like that?

I don't think it's
an easy decision.

I mean, I hope not.

I mean, she had people
depending on her.

She had to know the anguish

she put her mom
through by leaving.

You'd think that'd be enough
to make some people stay.

Yeah well,

trying to hold a family
together is not easy.

What do you mean?

My mom died two years ago.

Oh my God.

I'm so sorry.

It's okay. It
was angiosarcoma.

Which is this like really
rare type of breast cancer.

She went to the dermatologist

because she had this
rash that popped up.

And then by the end of the day,

she was in the emergency
room getting tests done.

Jesus.

And I remember I was at
some frat party on campus

when my sister texts
me and she's like,

"Mom is in the emergency room

and she's getting all
these tests done."


they weren't gonna
come back negative.

[somber music]

Jim.

It's sad, you know, because

she was always so
positive about everything.

She was like, "I'm
gonna beat it.

I'm going to beat it."

We knew she wasn't gonna beat it

but it's not like you
can tell her that.

Look Jim, I didn't
mean to pry, you know, I-

No, it's okay.

I'm actually kind
of surprised Collin

hasn't told you already.

He's the only person I
told when I came here.

He kind of met me
at a rough time.

Yeah, you mentioned that part.


So yeah, Mom died
and Dad asked me

to take a year off of school
because he couldn't handle

taking care of my sister.

He was a mess.

All of us, the
entire family unit

just completely
emotionally fucked.

And they needed me.

They needed me to be there
to take care of them.

But I just couldn't do it.

I didn't have the
stomach for it.

So here I am,

house sitting.

It's okay.

Look, Jim, what I
said about Donna,

you know, I didn't mean that-
No, it's,

it's okay.

I just, I get the need to

get out so you can just breathe.

You know what?

We could use some more wine.

Hmm?
Yeah.

[wine trickling]

We made short use of that.

[both chuckle]

Hey, can I ask you something?

And just like promise
you won't get mad.

Well I guess that depends.

On what?


Depending on what
you ask me, I guess.

Do you love him?

[Alyson chuckles]
I'm sorry.

I just, I need to know how bad

I'm fucking things up here.

You are very conceited.

You know that?

I like Collin, okay?

He's sweet.


Yeah, I guess I love him.

Then why-
Why

am I sleeping with you?

Yeah.

'Cause I'm fucked up too.

Just like you're fucked up.

And Donna, apparently,
where ever she is,

she's probably doing
something fucked up.

I mean, I don't know, you
just don't have sole ownership

of drama, I guess.

[both chuckle]

Yeah, no shit.

I don't know.

Maybe I just don't equate
sex with love anymore.

Maybe I like to engage
in self-sabotage.

You know like, I won't
let myself be happy

because I have no
idea how to be.

In any case, I guess
I sleep with you

because you make me feel safe.

I know that you
won't fall for me

because Collin is your friend.

And I know you won't tell on me

because Collin is your friend.

Or maybe I can sense
a tragedy in you

just like me.

[haunting music]

Jesus.

You really are fucked
up, you know that?

Absolutely.

Thank you for staying here.

I don't, I don't, I don't
like staying here alone.

I don't like leaving
you here alone.

[haunting music]

[ominous music]
[crickets chirping]

[breathes heavily]

[intense music]

[creepy breathing]

Dad?

I just miss her so much.


[intense music]


[haunting music]

How you doing, baby?
Hey.

Good, how are
you, Auntie Euni?

Well, come on in.

So can I get you a
soda or something?

Oh, no. I'm all good.

Thanks, though.

So how's your mother?

You know, she's
done pretty good.

She's seeing some
new guy, so I mean,

seems to like him.

I think he's gonna
stick around this time.

So that's a good thing.

And you know, she
was actually asking

about you the other day.

Oh, well, yeah.

I've been meaning
to keep in touch

but things have been
kind of hard lately.

Yeah, that.

I gotta ask, if you don't mind.

Are you okay? Like, why
do you need a piece?

Alex, I'm a 70 year old woman.

I live alone in a big
house on a dead end street.

I believe that I should
feel safe in my own home.

Absolutely, Auntie Euni. I
completely understand that.

It's just-
Well "it's just" that what?

It's just if something
were to happen to you

or God forbid to somebody else,

it kind of be my fault.

Nothing's gonna happen.

Auntie Euni, come on, look.

If Tony or Donna or my
mom were to find out.

They won't.

Yeah, but if they did,
they'd fucking barbecue my ass.

Language.
Right, sorry.

Look, nothing's
going to happen.

Listen, Alex, I'm desperate.

I haven't slept in nights.

I hear things in the house.

Like what?

I just, I just think

that I should feel
safe in my own house.

I think that I
should be prepared

in case something should happen.

I understand, okay?

But look, you know
you can always

call me if you need anything.

Me, Donna, any of
us, you can call.

I know. Thank you.

All right. But as requested.

Here.

So here's the thing, okay?

The most important
thing is gonna be

that safety right there.

Always make sure that's on.

Alex, I know
how to work a gun.

I've had a whole lifetime
while you were still a twinkle.

Okay.

Hey, it's loaded.

Good.

[ominous music]

Well, I gotta get out of here.

I love you, okay?

[ominous music]

[crickets chirping]

[phone vibrating]

Hi, Mom. It's Donna.

Oh Donna, it's you.

Oh, it's fine.

Whatever made you call
me at this late hour?

What, I can't just call my mom

to check and see
how you're doing?

I just wanted to make
sure you're okay.

I'm fine. I'm doing much
better than last night.

Good, see, I knew that
you would feel better

once you had a little
time under your belt.

And know that Tony and
I are here for you.

Are you gonna get a
good night's sleep?

Oh, I think so.

Well that's good.
Well, fingers crossed.

No more nightmares.

Oh, I don't think
that will be a problem.

I'm not afraid anymore.


Well, hopefully that lasts.

Oh, yes. I have it handled.

[Man On TV]
Where is everybody?

What do you mean?

Well, I've empowered myself.

I feel powerful.


I was just making
sure you're okay.

I mean, that just doesn't
sound like you, Mom.

I mean, I'm sorry.

I just was checking on you, Mom.

I was just worried.

You're good though?
You're sure you're okay?

Absolutely.

All right, well,

how about I talk to you
in the morning then?

All right. I love you, Mom.

Good night, dear.

[chattering on TV]

[Man On TV] I've heard of
him but I've never met him.

[Woman On TV] I worked
for one of his companies

but I've never seen him.

[intense music]

[footsteps thudding]

There you are.

Is there coffee?

I didn't make any.

Oh, okay, cool.

I was going to cut back anyway.

What?

What do you remember
about last night?

Ah, I dunno. I
was pretty tipsy.

Why?
After we went to bed.

Um, no, I don't
know what you mean.

Did I say something?

I don't think we
can do this anymore.


[soft music]

Oh, you're serious?

Okay. And why is that?

I just don't think
it's a good idea.

Not a good idea.
Okay, brilliant.

So did you decide
this before or after

we slept together?
Alys-

Well?

Something, something's wrong.

Yeah, clearly.

No, no.

I mean, something's
wrong with me.

Mm.

I don't understand
what's going on anymore.

You don't understand
what's happening?

Because it seems like
you've been doing

exactly what you want.

It's, I just...

It's just too much.

Okay, it is too much.

And I just, I need
you to understand.

Oh, I understand.
Jesus Christ.

Can I ever just tell
you how I'm feeling

without you freaking
out every time?

Fuck you, Jim!

How you're feeling?

Because it seems
like you're feeling

like you want me to off.

And you know what?

I don't need this shit.

I don't need any of it.

And if you tell Collin anything,

I will deny it.

And he'll believe me.

You remember that, Jim.


[ominous music]

[phone ringing]

Hey Jimbo.

Hey, Dad.

What's up? How is everything?

Everything's good.

How are you liking
that house-sitting job?

Look Dad, I don't
have a lot of time.

So I just wanted to call and

tell you that I love you.

And I'm really sorry
that I haven't called.

And I'm gonna call a
lot more from now on.

Well, I love you too, Jim.

Is everything okay?

Yeah, everything's fine.

I just, I wanted to
call and say I love you

and I love Caitlin.

Well, I'm glad to hear it.

And your sister's gonna be
really happy to hear from you.

I have to go. I'm sorry.

Okay.

Okay, um...

Bye, Jim.

[ominous music]

[intense music]

for coming over, man.

Of course,
brother. You know it.

It's your last night here.

We gotta do it up.
Hmm, thanks.

When does the
old lady get back?

I don't know. Sometime
tomorrow morning, I think.

But they could be back any time.

Oh, should I be here?

Yeah, no, they said I
could have people over.

Besides, I don't like
being here alone.

It started
getting creepy, huh?

Kind of.
[bottle cap clacking]

Fucking told you,
bro. I knew it.

You see anything?

Like what?
Anything?

Anything paranormal?

Unexplained?

No, nothing like
that. It's just...

I don't know. I started
getting uneasy here at night.

[bottles clink]

Mm, so maybe the
old lady isn't crazy.

No, no, she most
definitely is.

Did you bring any weed?

Does the Pope
shit in the woods?

Good.

Well, we're gonna
have to smoke now

because if dude gets back
and it smells like weed,

I'm in for it.

He was pretty specific.

He said "no weed?"

Mm-hmm.

What fucking year is it?

I know.

Man.

Okay.

Problem solved.

Cheers, bro.

Can I finish?

And she just keeps sucking.

Legs shaking, face tingling.

Uh!

Out of commish,
donezo after that.

Mm.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

Uh, not...

Yeah.

Only girl to
make my toes curl.

Mm.

Yeah.

God, that girl.

She could suck the
varnish off a footstool.

Mm.

I think I'm gonna
have to marry her.

Yeah, yeah, you should, um,

lock that down for sure.

So I know you said
that you don't like it

when I show you these photos,

but she sent me this last night.

Look at those mamma jammas.

Nice.
Yeah.

She's fucking perfect, bro.

Mm.

You okay, bro?

Yeah. I'm just tired.

I didn't really sleep.

[ominous music]

Feeling homesick?

Yeah. Yeah.

Something like that.

I'm sorry to have
to do this to you

but I think I have to
just like go upstairs

and get some sleep.

I know I asked you
to come hang out.

No, bro. That's fine.

Yeah, go ahead.

Are you sure
you're gonna be okay,

just like hanging out down here?

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I'll be fine.

I'll just sit on the couch,

have a couple beers, watch TV.

Go get some sleep.

All right. Thank you.

[bottles clink]

[ominous music]

[bottle cap clattering]

Are you sure you're okay
hanging out here alone?

Stop asking.

Go to sleep.

Okay.

[upbeat music on TV]

[ominous music]

[phone vibrating]

Alyson?

Jim. Please.


Please, something's wrong!

[upbeat music on TV]

[footsteps thudding]

Come back for more beer?

Jim?

We're home.

Here you go.

Hello?

Where the fuck is that kid?

Tony.

Jim, you here?

Where you going, Ma?

I'm tired, honey.

I'm going to bed.


Prick.

Probably out spending my money.

[phone ringing]
[ominous music]

Jim?

Jim?

What did you party too hard?

[creepy breathing]

Oh!

What is that?

[intense music]

Ma?

[fingers crack]

[intense music]

[door opens]

Oh, no!

Wait, please.

I just wanted to rest.

You'll never get to.

She'll never let
you sleep again.

Please.

Wait, please, don't do,
don't do that, please!

Good night.

[gun fires]

[Alyson screaming]


Jim?

Jim?

Oh my God!

Baby, it's okay.

We're gonna be okay.

Okay?
