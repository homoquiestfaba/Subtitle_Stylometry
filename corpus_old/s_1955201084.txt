Tell me about mother
and father again?

Ma and Pa got the fever
and went to sleep,

and now they're in a big
white cloud with God.

Is heaven warm?

Nice and warm.

Like a big down blanket
wrapped all around you.

No one's mean,
or hurts you in heaven?

No, my sweet.

When do we get to go?

Only when it's your turn.

How will we know when?

You'll know.

But only when it's your turn.

Do you miss them?

Of course I do, silly.

Me too.

<i>Whores.</i>

I'm scared.

Cover your eyes.

I'm always gonna be here
to protect you, okay?

And I'll protect you.

<i>Whore,
get yourself cleaned up,</i>

<i>you've got a customer.</i>

Okay. Go hide in the closet,
cover your ears and hum the song

until I come get you.

I'll be okay.

I always am.

Cover your ears.

Don't come out until I get you.

-Where is she?
-Sir.

The girl, your sister.
Where is she?

She... She's not here sir.

She...

Listen to me!

I'ma let you breathe again
and when I do

you're gonna tell him
exactly what he wants to hear.

Please.

Please, she's just a child.

Please, just let her be.

She's...
Just give her a few more years.

-Maybe I can work up her debt...
-It's too late for that.

She's gonna have to work harder
now that you're sold.

No. We have to stay together!

I own you now.

Alice!

<b>TAINTED:
THE HAUNTING OF ALICE D.</b>

<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

<i>Come on,
don't bail on me.</i>

All right.

I'll switch shifts or something.

You're always
so good to me, Joe.

Thank you.

What are you doing
tomorrow night?

Working.

Wanna make triple?

I'm not like that, honey.

But the next girls walking in,

they're more what you like.

See you next week.

Yeah, you will.

Dude.

What took you so long?

Stuck at work.

-Thank you.
-You work too much.

Not everyone's a rich
bastard like you, bro.

-Wassup, buddy.
-Wassup, man.

Sammie.

Hey, get these boys
some drinks, will you?

Sure, absolutely.

From the party?

-Who else is coming?
-Plus you guys, Michael.

-He's coming down from the city.
-Nice man it's been a while.

Yeah I'm bringing Lex.

-Nice.
-Tapping it yet?

No, but I think she's gonna take
the inaugural spin this week.

-That a boy.
-It's about time.

I don't know if I'ma be
able to make it though.

I told Krista
I'd hang out with her.

For Christ's sake.

Are you serious?

Unless she can come.

Unless she can...
She hates me man.

I know but just like a...
Just a little.

Dude ditch the bitch
come hang with us.

All right I'll talk to her.
But you know how she is.

-All right, you'll talk to her?
-You know how she is.

Come on.

Weak dude. Weak.

Here we go.

Hello.

I heard you do private parties?

What type of private parties?

Let's just say
there's a lot more wads of cash

for the right type of dancing.

I'm in.

Yeah, you are.

<i>Zeke, it's me.</i>

<i>Open the door.</i>

I've got
the really good stuff.

Acid.

Now I was thinking
we could do it tomorrow night.

-God, you smell like cigars.
-I was at the titty bar.

And you didn't invite me?

Wasn't very much fun anyway.

'cause I wasn't there.

You don't like my friends.

I like most of them.

<i>How are you?</i>

I'm Adam.

-What's up.
-Hey, Adam.

-Hi Anita.
-Hello.

-Hey.
-It's Jenny right?

-Yeah.
-Good, thanks for coming.

-What's up?
-Come on in.

This place is sick.

It's a nice
little home, isn't it?

This is so cool, yeah.

Have a seat ladies,
make yourselves comfortable.

Yeah, absolutely.

That's not even sexy.

Hey where are you two
scoundrels running off to?

-My god.
-He's my cousin.

He hits puberty
and look at him go.

They're gonna get lost
in this place man, it's huge.

It's crazy.

I told you
it was awesome.

Hey, look at that.

1898, baby.

-That's kind of creepy.
-I know.

Yeah, kind of turns me on,
actually.

We need some drinks don't we?
You want some drinks?

-Yes.
-Okay.

Mind if we explore
the place a little?

By all means,
yes, just don't get lost.

Make sure you come back.

See you in a little bit boys.

Bye bye.

This place is ridiculous.

Jesus.

Stop it.

Really is good to see you, man.

You too buddy.

Basement hasn't
changed much?

-Since we were kids.
-No.

-This place still creeps me out.
-Very creepy.

Hey, let's get that wood
on the fire.

Let's do it.

Party time.

-There you are.
-There you are.

-Hey.
-You get lost or what?

I'm trying to.

-This place is amazing.
-It's not hard.

Yeah, it looks good.

Hello.

This place is amazing.

Yeah, you should see my place.

-Why, is it like this?
-No, but you should see it.

Okay, awesome.

Yeah.

Man, look at them.

Told you.

Get 'em all for yourself, man.

Yeah, life is good,
can't complain.

-What's up man.
-What's up Zeke.

-Not much. How you doing?
-Good to see you.

-Where were you man?
-I was there sneaking a beer.

Okay.

I was in the fridge.
How you doing?

-I haven't seen you in ages.
-It's been a while.

-Yeah.
-You still in the city?

NYC. You need to come visit.

Yeah I will.
You still acting?

-Still trying.
-Think you can get me in there.

-Yeah.
-Nice dude.

I seen you on that...
What was it?

-The hemorrhoids commercial?
-Constipation.

Sorry, man.

I've obviously got the face
of a man who can't shit.

Painful.

-Twenty grand.
-Woo, yeah.

-Krista.
-Hey.

-How are you?
-Good how are you?

-Good, real good to see you.
-You're famous.

-I wouldn't say that.
-Yeah, you are.

We just stopped
by for a little bit.

Very cool.

Zeke, it's nice to see
you brought your own hoe.

Up yours, Joe.

And nice to see you too, Krista.

So, place looks good?

Yeah, it's bomb, dude,
the crown...

All this inset
in the ceiling. This...

They did a nice job
restoring it. It's real nice.

Yeah, it's kind of weird though

that your dad restored
this place after what happened.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Every home has a history.

Some are just
more flavorful than others.

Yeah,

Hey.

So did Joe tell you
about the house?

It used to be a brothel.

Joe's great grandpa founded it.

You got me.

I'm the descendant of pimps.

Well, if he didn't tell you
about the house,

then he certainly didn't
tell you about Alice.

<i>It all started
over 100 years ago.</i>

<i>Two sisters were forced
into prostitution.</i>

<i>Their names were Alice
and her sister Delilah.</i>

<i>Their parents had died
of a terrible fever leaving</i>

<i>the two girls and their
only known relative,</i>

<i>an uncle.</i>

<i>Unfortunately their uncle
was a horrible man</i>

<i>who had a gambling problem.</i>

<i>He sold the girls to a local
brothel, which was owned</i>

<i>by Joe's great grandpa,
Sr. Davenport,</i>

<i>to repay his debt.</i>

Use her for something.

You eat like a horse.

What'd you say?

I said it is he
who eats like a horse.

Reply with a sir!

It is he who eats
like a horse. Sir.

Innocence mixed with defiance.

-Yes.
-I like it.

You'll find that they're
usually very obedient.

Especially the older one.

But you'll have no problems.

What's your name?

Alice.

From now on
you're Alice D.

<i>Years went by,</i>

<i>and Alice grew into a beautiful
young woman.</i>

<i>Constantly defiant.</i>

<i>Sr. Davenport had her chained
to the bed.</i>

<i>Her beauty and spirit
were what Sr. Davenport</i>

<i>loved the most.</i>

No, no.

So,
what happened to her?

She offed herself.

That's a beautiful
little story.

Except it's not a story.

It's the truth and you know it.

Hey, why you gotta come
in here and be a buzz kill?

-Are you jealous?
-No.

I think you're jealous.

I think you want this.

I don't wanna be
anything like you.

Or your family.

Treating people
like their objects,

making money off
of human slaves.

How original.

That was a long
time ago, sweetheart.

Yeah.
Except all through high school

you used to brag
about your family history.

Look at you.

You're still treating
women like objects.

Women are objects.

Beautiful luscious objects.

And it seems to be sometimes
they like to be objectified.

Am I right?

Listen, Krista,

I'm sorry but...
I'm just not that into you.

I know deep down inside
you wanna climb up on me

and hate fuck.

But you're just not my type.

I hate you.

Well, if you hate me so much,
and if you hate all of this,

why don't you just beat it.

I think I'm ready to go.

Okay.

That was an all-time record.

Don't let Alice
scare you too much.

Not here.

I want a nicer room.

Yes ma'am.

Hey.

Hey.

I'm Michael, I don't know
if you remember from earlier.

-Jenny.
-Hey, Jenny.

Hey.

It's a pretty cool place

So you know Joe,
is that right?

No, I know Natasha.

You're friends with Natasha.

How do you guys
know each other?

We just know each other.

Work.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

It's just...

It's nothing. I'm...

I'm ready to party.

-Do you wanna get a drink?
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

-I should have offered.
-Yeah. Okay.

Krista brought that, man.

-Really?
-Yes.

It's not really smart
leaving that stuff around you,

I know that for sure.

She put a nice little ribbon
on there and everything.

Nice.

-Classy chick.
-Yeah, she is.

Well, at least
she's got good taste in liquor.

-Shall we?
-Yeah, man, pour some out.

Hey, you guys,
want some whiskey?

Yeah, cool.

All right.

Jesus.

How many staircases
are in this place?

A lot. Let's go.

<i>Pictures and paintings.</i>

<i>Is that it?</i>

Yeah this is it.

Yeah.
There it is my man.

Right there.

Isn't this the Rumsky room?

This is the Rumsky room.
Sally Rumsky.

Your old blue bags,
your remember her?

Damn that girl had a...

Sally Rumsky didn't hear it.

This is the stash spot
right here man.

Many o nights.

Memories, man.

Memories. Memories.

So... Jen.

I didn't get to meet you
last night but...

I'm glad you're here.

Thanks.

Did Natasha explain
everything to you?

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

Tasha, you explain
the rules to Jen?

I just wanna make sure
we're cool.

Yeah.

I mean I love to have
a good time and...

I wanna make sure
we're on the same page.

You see, I'm paying
you a lot of money,

which means I own
your ass tonight.

Anything me
and my boys want, we get.

You got it?

Yeah.

Okay.

Put that down.

Hey, hey.

Hey. Relax. Relax.

Relax.

Just relax.

Yeah, that's better.

That's better.

So you're not even gonna
get like a small percentage

of trust fund or whatever?

Probably not.
You still love me?

Here we go.

Hey, what about this one, baby?

Yeah.

Looks good.

This place is so big.

Just keeps going and going.

Maybe I should have slept
with your cousin.

If he wasn't such a prick.

You better be kidding.

There's like so many
random little crevices.

Hey, come here.

Babe?

What?
What's the matter?

Were you looking
at that whore downstairs

in the butt dress?

Hey, don't say that, all right?

I don't care
about anyone but you.

It's just that...

right when that one girl
with the black dress...

came in.

Yeah.

You just kind of stopped
kissing me.

No, I didn't

But, that doesn't matter
now because...

you are my little angel,
and this is our weekend.

What is this?

Well, that's kind of sexy.

They just hooked onto the bed?

You wanna use them?

Come on, let's use them.

Or not.

You know those whores
are going to hell.

Just kiss me.

If you wanna use them,
we can but we don't have to.

Tonight might be special.

-What the hell was that?
-What was that?

Do you hear that?

Go!

Get out!
Get out!

-Lighten up.
-Okay.

-Drink, okay?
-Okay.

Trying to blaze.

They're hot chicks, man, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Joe out did himself, man.

...That Jenny girl
seems like a sweetheart.

Do you sweet on her?

Yeah, I sweet on her.

I knew you would be.

No, I mean she seems sweet.

She's... Yeah, she's shy.

I don't think she realized
how gorgeous she is.

You... You want her first?

I'm just saying
if you like her, you know...

You should probably
get with that first.

Just a thought,
that's all I'm saying.

And she's perfect I mean,
she's totally perfect for you.

Joe must have picked her out.

For you, particularly.

What do you mean,
Joe picked her out for me?

What do you mean,
what do I mean?

What you just said.

Joe must have
picked her out for me.

My god.

-The girls are hookers, man.
-Are you serious?

Yeah.

Holy shit.

Dude, I wouldn't worry about it,
they're totally paid for.

Courtesy Joe, man.
He hooked it up.

Yeah, well, look Adam,
I don't have to pay for sex.

I do.

I mean, I don't, but I do.

Like sometimes,
depending on the chick really.

Fat girls, they love me,
I don't know why.

Gravitational pulls,
I don't know.

She seemed like a cool chick.

No, dude,
I wouldn't worry about it.

Just bang the hell out of her,
and then love will follow.

Aren't you guys getting
a little too old for this shit?

I mean you were pulling these
pranks back in high school.

No, man, I don't think so.

Great.

I came all the way home
for this party

and all the girls
are prostitutes.

That's fantastic.

This is fantastic, guys.

You know,
if I wanted a hooker

I could have just stayed
in New York.

Dude.

What are you talking about?

Dude, it's gonna be amazing.
Hey, Michael!

Shit.

This place is haunted.

All women are whores, okay?

These one's aren't allowed
to play hard to get.

-Dude.
-Hey, lighten up.

All right?

Get yourself a drink.
Let's have some fun, come on.

He's right, you know.

Women.

What's wrong with you?

At least
they're not bad looking.

I mean they're
good looking guys.

At least they're not...
Fat and hairy.

Or smelly, ew.

Anita, can you go hang out
with the guys a little bit?

Give us a second.

Fine.

Listen you're gonna stop
pouting and start having fun,

or else this is gonna be
the worst night of your life.

Hey.
I'm talking to you.

Do you want the money or not?
Because it's kinda a done deal.

Yeah, I need money.

I have my tuition
and my sister's sick...

I don't... You don't
have to tell me why, okay?

We all have our reasons for
being here, trust me, I get it.

You have to be appearing
to have fun, okay?

You're making me look like
an idiot for bringing you here.

Do you know how many girls
would have clawed your eyes out

for this job?

Tons.

He wanted someone sweet
and innocent

and lucky for you,
you're the only bitch I know

that's sweet
and innocent anymore, okay?

Listen, stop, stop, stop.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry
that we have to do this, okay?

I'm sorry for whatever's
going on in your head or at home

and whatever, okay, but the best
advice I can give you...

Just... Just try
to have fun, okay?

Let's go make you a drink.

Okay.

Just loosen up.

-Okay.
-It'll be good.

-Okay.
-All right.

Come on.

So you ready to party?

What should I make you?

Something that'll make me...

Look, I didn't know
that you guys were hookers.

Sorry, I'm not into it.

Just tell me
what you want to drink.

I'm not a hooker.

You're not a hooker?

Then what are you?

Screw you.

You don't even know me so
you have no right to judge me.

I'm not judging you,
I'm just not into hookers.

I said I'm not a hooker.

Then why are you here?

Why are you here?

I'm here because
one of my best friends

is throwing a party.

I had no clue that he hired you.

Well I really
need to the money.

You need the money.

So you're just willing to...

Listen I need the money.

Come on, get a job.

-I have a job.
-Then get another one.

This isn't me okay.
You have no right to judge me.

This is a one-time thing.

I'm doing this for one night.

You suck.

That is...

That was close.

I almost won.

-Yeah.
-Okay.

It's a secret,
it's a secret, it's a secret.

What's under there?

Got some chalk
on your belly.

-Here you guys.
-That's a good start.

My God!

Couldn't really spin on it.
So get naked.

Pants. Pants.
It's a war.

Depends
how you define winning.

I'm gonna go...

There you are.

Let me show you my room.

I thought you were playing.

Nah, this is more fun.

This is it.

That was nice.

I almost got it.

No, you didn't, but see
the whole problem is

you hit the 12 ball and...

Really close.

The cue ball is the one
you wanna start with.

Nice...

Michael, yes, finally. God.

Where you been all my life, man?
I need a partner.

Look at these ladies.

-How are you?
-Where's Joe and Jenny?

Who?

I don't know man.
We were playing

Joe took off
right in the middle of the game.

Who cares about them?
Come join us.

He must be
showing her around, partner.

Why don't you enjoy
the house too?

Yes, yes.

That's a fantastic idea, man.
See I'm depending on you.

This is really important, okay?

Wear big balls.
Go.

Yes. Yes.

-Nice, ladies.
-We lost.

-Well.
-Show the goods.

What do you got,
what do you got for me?

That's a good start.

That's good too.

You're gonna enjoy this.

I guarantee it.

Yeah.

Bad timing, buddy.

We're getting busy here.

Hey, can I...

Can you what, man?
Spit it out.

I kind of wanted
to bang her first.

Lucky girl.

You know what?

My gift to you.

Don't be too nice.

Come on, let's go to a room.

No, no, no, no, no.

You stay here.
You use mine, okay?

I like that.

Get in there.

-What are you staring at?
-I'm staring at a girl

who is obviously
in over her head.

I didn't ask for your help.

I'm sorry, you're right.

You're right.

Do you want me to go
get Joe and Adam too?

I was informed
about 30 minutes ago

that tonight
is anything goes, so...

I'd be more than happy
to go get them for you.

They'd probably be willing
to come up here for a good time.

Just so you know, I'm not
interested in sleeping with you.

The feelings are mutual.

-Devils.
-Devils.

-Man.
-Alpha female.

-The dominant.
-The dom.

The dom. The dom.

It just depends.

Rough is extra, baby.

-You wanna get a room?
-Yeah.

Who is this creepy old dude?

So now you're
talking to me?

I'm asking for information.
Doesn't mean I like you.

It's Joe's great grandfather.

Sr. Davenport.

How do you know?

Joe had it hanging in his
bedroom when we were kids.

What a creep.

Is the story true
about that girl Alice?

And his great grandfather?

-How do you know about that?
-The red headed girl told me.

From what Joe told me,
yeah, it's true.

How'd she do it?

Well, there's been
many theories, many stories.

One time when Joe was
really drunk he told me

that his dad had told him
what really happened.

Alice and her sister were sold
to Joe's great grandfather

by their uncle
to help repay a debt.

Eventually Alice's sister
got sold off to another guy.

And after years and years
of being enslaved here,

Alice grew more
and more defiant.

Look at that
delicate little rose over there.

I bet she costs
a sweet penny?

Sweet and a neat
like a little bird.

But I like mine
with some handle.

I'll be collecting
for all that grabbing.

You'll be collecting
for more than that.

Let me see how mean
she really is.

Hello, little lady.

I said hello, little lady.

Stupid whore!

Chain her.

Don't forget, I own you.

I apologize.
This visit is free.

Thank you.

Come on, baby, don't be sad.

I'll take care of you.

Let's go upstairs.

You've got a full night's work.
Unchain her.

What a way to go.

Pretty heavy stuff?

You must think
I'm a real asshole

to be friends with him?

Yeah.
Pretty much.

You know I built that myself.

You made this?

No.

Where are you going?
Snooping in Joe's underwear?

-You all right?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

I need to sit down.

-You okay?
-Yeah.

Do you feel weak?

-A little bit.
-Here, sit down.

You okay?

What's wrong?

I just feel kind of dizzy.

All right just rest.
Rest.

Yeah, this is the one.

No, no, no, no.

Mood lighting, baby.

Why can't you
keep that one on?

-Just leave that one on.
-Okay, that's cool.

Yeah.

What was that?

What?

Do you hear that?

I didn't hear anything.

Just relax.

Do you hear that?

I don't hear anything.

Okay, just relax.

I feel so weird.

You feel weird?

It's the weed, baby.

What the hell are you doing?

I'm not gonna ask you
any more questions

about why you're here.
Okay?

Thanks.

No problem.

Was that you
screaming, Jennifer?

Hey, don't use up
all your energy.

<i>Remember, it's my turn next.</i>

What do you mean?

Woo, yeah!

Yeah, baby!

Right there!

Yeah.

You think they're screwing?

We'll top 'em.

We'll top 'em.

-Nice work.
-Good prank.

You wanna drink?

Yeah.

Natasha.
Natasha.

Where are you going?

What's wrong?

I'm...

Are you seeing stuff?

No.

I think...

I think I just need
a cold bath or something.

That's sexy.

You know what,
there's a nice bathtub.

You want me to run you a bath?

That sounds very nice.

Yeah.
Okay.

Okay, let's do that.

-Have fun, guys.
-Yeah, you too. Jesus.

So, what are we gonna do?

What do you wanna do?

Let's go upstairs.

Let's go.

You got it.

Do you believe in ghosts?

Nope.

Why not?

I thought you said
no more questions.

I lied.

Guess I can forgive you.

Thank you.

Next question.

Favorite color?

Favorite color.

Really?

Come on, we gotta talk
about something,

I'm not just gonna
sit here in silence.

Fine.

Blue, I guess.

Me too.

You copycat.

Copycat.

Favorite...

food.

Favorite food it's tough.

It's tough.

'Cause I got like pizza,
chocolate, sushi...

You have to pick one.

So you're making up
the rules now?

Sushi.

Predictable.

-I am not predictable.
-Yeah, you are.

-Come on.
-You are so predictable.

Okay.

Try me.

All right.
All right.

Okay.

You're parents
are happily married,

you've got three
strapping brothers

who are your best friends.

You're mom's a homemaker,
dad's a lawyer,

and mommy loved to make
her growing boys peach pie

on the weekends...

Stop.

Just stop.

No.

No.

Actually, my parents got
divorced when I was nine.

My dad is a lawyer,
you got that right.

But he moved to Chicago...

Married his 20 year younger
secretary

and now has a new family.

I have an older
and a younger sister,

and my mom's
an elementary school teacher.

And I have never had peach pie.

Do you ever see him?

My dad?

Not really.

We don't have much in common.

How about you?

My favorite food of all time.

It's easy,
my grandma's Irish cooking.

Stew with potatoes and carrots
and lamb, brown bread...

I meant your family.

It takes me back.

Is your grandma
around anymore?

No one's around anymore.

It's just myself

and my younger sister,
and she's eight.

She's why you're here.

Yeah.

My dad, he left
after our mom died.

My grandma, she passed
last year so it's just us.

And when I work I have to find
someone to stay with her

which doesn't always happen.

So it's hard to go to school,
pay for school,

keep a steady job, take care
of her and make ends meet.

I'm sorry.

No, don't be.

What doesn't kill us
makes us stronger.

I'll do whatever I have to do
to take care of her.

I shouldn't have judged you.

It's no biggie.

Is that why you don't
believe in ghosts?

What do you mean?

You mom and your grandma.

Yeah, I guess. I mean...

They'd come to me
if they could, right?

Yeah.

Maybe, I don't know.

I feel like maybe spirits
get stuck sometimes.

Like if they really want to...

I don't want to talk
about it anymore, okay?

Yeah.

Yeah.

You're not gonna
sleep with them.

Unless you want to.

You're not really my type.

Good.

I'll be right there, baby.

Yeah, yeah.

It's killer weed.

Proud of you.

Boop.

Hi, ladies.

Hey.

Get in there.

Wait, wait.

God damn.

Hey, wake up.

Hey.

Come on. Come here.

Hey, guys, don't mess around.

Assholes.

Here we go.

Careful.

Hey Michael.

We're busy.

-Hey man, you want a drink?
-No, we're busy.

Find another hoe.

You're not a hoe.

Okay.

What are they doing out there?

Joe and them
get a little crazy sometimes.

They've been really loud.

I feel so messed up.

I feel great.

No, I think we're like
really messed up, Michael.

The room is, like, moving.

It is moving.

What a freaking party.

What was that?

Sorry.

Don't be.

Natasha!

No! No!

Joe.

Hey man.

Hey, what the hell.

Hey, hey.

I don't know what's going on.

-There's...
-Where's Anita?

I don't know.
I don't know.

<i>Natasha.</i>

<i>Natasha.</i>

-Where's Anita?
-We were in the tub

and then
there was this... This...

God!

No! No!

Help.

Leave me alone.

Just leave me alone.

What the hell are you doing?

What the hell are you doing?

What are you doing, man?

Have you lost your mind?

What's going on down here?

What the hell happened?
What happened?

Zeke!

No! No!

Jennifer! Run!

I own you, whore.

<i>Joe, come to me, Joe.</i>

<i>Joe, come to me.</i>
