<i>Turaga VAKAMA:
Gathered friends...</i>

<i>listen again to our legend
of the Bionicle.</i>

<i>in the time before time</i>

<i>in the glorious city
of Metru Nui...</i>

<i>we believed our noble Toa
would protect us</i>

<i>But they fell one by one...</i>

<i>as an unrelenting shadow</i>

<i>sought to enforce
endless sleep...</i>

<i>so that he could create
a time of dark order...</i>

<i>then awaken the world
as their conqueror.</i>

<i>Kreka: The last Toa!</i>

uh!

uh.

Huh?

Huh!

Aah!

<i>Turaga VAKAMA:
And so Toa Lhikan</i>

<i>delivered the sacred stones</i>

<i>to a chosen Matoran
from each Metru:</i>

Fire, stone...

-Toa!
-Toa Lhikan?

Guide the others
with your wisdom.

<i>Turaga VAKAMA:
in every city's life</i>

<i>there is a period
of great building</i>

<i>where artisan builders
such an Onewa</i>

<i>create wonders
that confirm our faith</i>

<i>in the great spirit
of civilization.</i>

TOA LHIKAN: Builder,
l'm counting on your courage.

<i>Turaga VAKAMA:
This city was not just built</i>

<i>from the construction
of things,</i>

<i>but from the collection
of history.</i>

<i>My friend Whenua
the archivist</i>

<i>knew this more than most:</i>

Don't archive it.

Whoa.

<i>Turaga VAKAMA:
it was an age</i>

<i>when brave Matoran
like Matau</i>

<i>would selflessly test
the latest innovations</i>

<i>with foolhardy courage.</i>

Whoa-oh!

Whoa!

uh! uh!

Aah--uh!

Don't break it.

<i>Turaga VAKAMA: But it also
was a time of reason,</i>

<i>study, observance,</i>

<i>and looking into the future.</i>

<i>And few looked
further forward</i>

<i>without seeing
what was in plain sight</i>

<i>than dear Nuju:</i>

What?

Toa Lhikan?

Follow the map, thinker.

<i>Turaga VAKAMA: Ahh.
it was a time of sharing,</i>

<i>remembering,</i>

<i>building, adventuring,
dreaming.</i>

<i>But, above all</i>

<i>it was the time
of my kind--</i>

<i>the time of mask makers,</i>

<i>those forr whom the art of
creating great Kanohi Masks</i>

<i>from Kanoka disks</i>

<i>was all that they lived for.</i>

Aah!

Matoran are vanishing.
Deceit lurks...

<i>in the shadows
of Metru Nui.</i>

Keep it safe.

This time...

your farewell
will be forever...

brother.

You lost the right
to call me brother long ago!

Look out!

lt's the end
of the line, Toa.

uh!

Where do You think
You're going?

<i>TOA LHIKAN:
Kreka! Heads up!</i>

Brother!

Oh! Help me, please!

Compassion...

was always your weakness,
brother.

Ohh!

<i>TO A LHIKAN: Save the heart
of Metru Nui,</i>

<i>the great spirit
depends on You.</i>

Ohh!

Time is short.

No, no! Wait!

Hurry, Vakama.

<i>VAKAMA: Come back!</i>

Aaah!

uh!

No-o-o-o!

uh!

lt's all my fault.

<i>MAKUTA: I must have
the Mask of Time.</i>

Oh, what is this?

Whoa.

Huh.

Without You, we have no Toa.

Oh. Who will protect us now?

l should have done something!

You should not
blame yourself, Vakama.

Uh, Turaga Dume.

You are a mask maker,
not a Toa.

l have come
for the Mask of Time.

Yes, uh, well,
l am sory, Turaga.

lt's not yet ready.

Great Masks
take time to craft.

Penaps You are using
inferior disks.

l use the finest quality
available, Turaga.

Uh, only Great Disks
are more pure...

but they can only
be retrieved by a Toa.

Of course. Pity Toa Lhikan
is not here to help.

Bring the completed mask
to the coliseum...

before the Great Contest.

The destiny of Metru Nui
rests in your hands.

That's what Toa Lhikan said.

Ohh...the Toa Suuva.

Ohh.

-Aah!
-Ohh!

Fire-spitter,
did You wrong-turn?

You tell me.

lt appears we are not alone.

Well, Toa Lhikan summoned me.

Me, too.

lt appears we have all received
these curious stones...

all similar, yet each unique.

Like us. All Matoran--

some just more handsome-looking
than the rest.

Who's ever heard
of a Matoran...

getting summoned
to the Great Temple like this?

What will be asked of us?

We are all just strangers.

Ha ha. Some stranger
than others.

your negativity pollutes
this sanctuary, Builder.

Save the lessons
for your class, teacher.

VAKAMA: Look,
we're here for a reason.

Ohh.

Ohh...

l've never seen...

Toa Lhikan!

Whoa!

Would You look at that?

Faithful Matoran,
Metru Nui needs You.

A shadow threatens its heart.

<i>Prove yourselves worthy, Toa,</i>

And fear not.

The Great Spirit
shall Guide You...

in ways
You could not imagine.

Hey.

Huh. Amazing.

Am l...a Toa?

lf we appear
to be Toa heroes...

then we are Toa heroes!

Now, this is a Toa tool. Hah!

Ha ha ha! Always wanted
one of these. Hmm.

Such perfect balance.

A disk launcher.

uh! Hah!

Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo ha ha ha!

Whaa--daah!

Ohh!

<i>ONEWA: Nice move, Matau.</i>

Need l remind You
this is about honoring...

our responsibility
to the Great Spirit?

<i>Onewa's right</i>

Mask maker, You saw
Toa Lhikan last, right?

Well, uh...

Uh, what did he say
we could expect?

He told me
to stop the darkness.

That l had to save
the heart of Metru Nui.

Then the Dark Hunters
took him away.

lt was because of me.

No!

<i>TO A LHIKAN: Save
the heart of Metru Nui:</i>

<i>Find the great Disks.</i>

What's with him? Heh heh.

All that smelting
must've cooked his head.

l saw it.
Metru Nui was destroyed!

The Great Kanoka Disks
were headed right for me.

Thanks for dream-sharing,
Vakama.

Well, according to
ancient legend...

one Great Disk is hidden
in each Metru.

And finding them
would prove to Turaga Dume...

that we are worthy Toa.

So, we go on
a scavenger hunt...

because a fire-spitter
stood too long...

in front of his forge?

Visions can be
a sign of madness, yes.

Or messages
from the Great Spirit.

But as Toa, we cannot
afford to ignore them.

-l concur.
-Yeah.

-Then it is agreed.
-Mm-hmm.

<i>NOKAMA: Each will recover
the great Disk</i>

<i>from our own Metru.
and present it to Turaga Dume.</i>

He will know what to do.

l'm doing this for Lhikan,
no one else.

lt says here the Great Disks
will be found...

by seeking the unfamiliar
within the familiar.

<i>Turaga VAKAMA: And so.
whether it was madness</i>

<i>or messages
from the great spirit</i>

<i>that Guided us</i>

<i>we undertook
the greatest scavenger hunt</i>

<i>in the history
of Metru Nui.</i>

<i>We werre justly proud
of our new Toa stature.</i>

<i>And one by one
in our homelands</i>

<i>we sought out, found,</i>

<i>and recovered
these great Disks.</i>

<i>We never even feared
the consequences.</i>

<i>WWWoe hhaaadd bbboooHdd hhoeaaa rtttss</i>

<i>and courage enough
for the whole city:</i>

<i>hf You measure a hero
by effort alone.</i>

<i>we most certainly
were great Toa.</i>

<i>But effort alone
is seldom enough</i>

<i>forr legends.</i>

<i>Turaga DUME ON SPEAKER:
it is with deep sorrrow</i>

<i>that I must inform You</i>

<i>of the disappearance
of our beloved Toa Lhikan.</i>

<i>But. with the help
of the Vahhki</i>

<i>order shall be maintained.</i>

Trust in me...

and soon, all your concerns
will be laid to rest.

Hmm.

lnteresting.

-Toa!
-Toa!

Hello, Metru Nui!

l always wanted
to loud-shout that.

Vakama.

Ha ha ha ha.

Matoran one day...

Toa the next.

No wonder You have not yet
completed the Mask of Time.

Forgive the delay, Turaga.

NOKAMA: We present You
with the great Kanoka Disks...

and pledge ourselves as
the new guardians of Metru Nui.

Ah ha. Toa must prove themselves
with deeds, not simple gifts.

<i>Turaga DUME:
Matoran of Metru Nui:</i>

the Great Spirit has provided us
with six new Toa...

who will undoubtedly
demonstrate their worthiness...

on this field of honor.

Catch this...
fire-spitter.

What a waste.

Cross the sea of protodermis
and be honored as Toa.

NOKAMA: What's going on?

What do we do now?!

We use the mask powers
the Great Spirit gave us!

Yeah, and just how
do we do that?

Follow me! This way!

NOKAMA:
Look up! Over there!

uh!

uh!

uh!

uh!

Aaaaah!

uh!

-ONEWA: Behind You!
-Huh?

Time to quick-run!

NOKAMA: Aah!

Aah--uh!

uh!

uh!

Enough!

Ha ha ha ha!

Let us praise these jesters.

Perhaps they sought
to entertain us...

during this...
difficult time.

Or are they imposters...

No! We are Toa!

...responsible for
Toa Lhikan's demise?

No, it was them!
They took him!

Seize them!

What?

Now what?

Nuju, hang on!

Somebody!

uh!

NOKAMA: Brothers!

Vakama! The statue--

bring it down!

uh!

Yes.

Haah!

Heh heh heh heh.

uh.

The new Toa must not interfere
with the plan.

They are mere Matoran
in Toa armor.

As is our duty,
we shall not fail.

<i>VAKAMA:
We've been betrayed:</i>

<i>NOKAMA: We've got
to save the others!</i>

To do that, we need
to find our mask powers.

l agree.

But we have
to get out of here.

Come on!

Huh.

What are You waitin' for?

Ah-hah! Whoa!

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

Whoa!

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

Ha ha!

uh!

Do You think
they went this way?

Why do l bother?

<i>MAKUTA:
the Mask of Time</i>

<i>is not yet commpleted.</i>

No.

But when
the Great Shadow falls...

the Vahki will ensure
every Matoran's fate.

<i>KONGU: But the entire
system could explode</i>

<i>if I reverse the flow.</i>

Do it.

Then again,
it--it might work.

NOKAMA:
Aaaah! Hang o-o-on!

uh!

uh! Gotta get...outta here!

<i>WHENUA:
Aw, this is just great.</i>

<i>WWWhhoenmn wwwoookkoe uu pbb</i>

all l woried about
was cataloging.

Now l go down in history
as Metru Nui's most wanted.

You? l'm the one
suffering here--

stuck with
a Ko-Matoran big-brain...

<i>and an Onu-Matoran
stock boy.</i>

Hey...whoa.

We will never escape.

our freedom is gone...

our future is hopeless.

Toa?

Giving up hope?

uh!

Everyone all right?

Oh! Sure, fine.

Just enjoying the view.

Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

<i>NOKAMA: Vakama!</i>

<i>MAKUTA: Vakama!</i>

Toa Lhikan?

Ah! Ah!

Ohh.

<i>NOKAMA: Vakama!</i>

<i>Vakama!</i>

Another vision?

How about less vision-seeing
and more Toa-saving?

We're slipping!

Can we make it to that tower?

uh!

We're going to have to.

Yaah!

Do it!

MATAU: This is good!
This is good! Yeah!

ALL: uh!

Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Meant to do that.

That was fuu--uh!

Matau!

Oh...

Ohh!

Aah! Ha ha ha!

Has he found his mask power?

Ohh! Hoo hoo!
Look at me!

l can--ohh!

Maybe not.

Wind...fly.

MATAU: Hey, Nokama,
nice move back there.

NOKAMA: Very nice.

And check out these wings.

Whoo! Ha ha ha.

Hmm...

One of these Great Disks
has got to be the Mask of Time.

Ohh?

Huh.

Remarkable.

Vakama? Come on.

What? Just a moment.

Vakama, we've got to go.

But the disks--

Look!

<i>Toa Lhikan's spirit star:</i>

<i>Each Toa has one:</i>

<i>As long as it burns
in the night sky,</i>

Toa Lhikan remains alive.

lt is headed toward Po-Metru.

What about our captured
Toa brothers?

We need Toa Lhikan
to stop Turaga Dume...

and free the other Toa.

And how do You propose
we quick-catch a spirit star?

Penaps a way has been
revealed, rider.

Vakama!

What are these?

Storage containers...

but most odd-looking.

<i>MAKUTA: Vakama:</i>

The Matoran!
They're in danger!

<i>NOKAMA: What do You see?</i>

Nothing, sister.
Nothing at all.

Eh, cross-wired!

Turaga, l know You not.

your concerns should be with
your own identity, not mine.

Freedom and escape
are different objectives...

but both aren't easily realized.

You are stuck in here
with us, so...

l have freedom, even in here.

But for escape,
Toa mask powers are needed.

l doubt we will ever be in touch
with our mask powers.

Oh, never doubt what
You are capable of.

The Great Spirit lives
through us all.

Vakama, your destiny no longer
lies in sculpting masks.

You are a Toa.

Ahh, l'll never be
a real Toa.

l can't even make
a decent mask.

l'm just a cross-wired freak
who has weird dreams.

Toa Lhikan, You got it wrong.

You will.

Have faith.

Ride's over.

-Ooh!
-uh!

Stick close.

Bad things happen
in the desert.

Oh, Matau, You don't know
what You're talking about.

Fine. Don't listen to me,
teacher.

Hello!

Hello, hello!

Guess they all quick-sped.

Builders do not abandon
their projects...

without good reason.

Then where is everyone?

-Over here, Toa!
-No! Kreka!

Aah! A Toa hero
knows no fear!

Unh! uh!

Help! Vakama! Nokama!

There's a Toa down!

Kreka: What's going on?

Are You doing that?

Now what?

Bioquake?

Oh! Worse.

Kikanalo!

l'm out of here! Let's go!

Hey! What about me?

Matau, hang on!

Follow me!

Hmm. No! Get down!

Aah!

Aah! Aah!

No!

You fool!

l was wrong.

You were right, my brother.

Heh. lt's amazing
what You can learn...

when You're not always
speak-teaching.

What did You say?

l didn't say--
Why the mask-glowing?

Nokama!

Whoo! Whoo hoo hoo!

My mask power.

The chief wants to know...

why we are allied
with the Dark Hunters.

Tell him we're not.

We seek a friend who's been
taken by the hunters.

We are...

free to pass...

since we are both against...

the hunters who trespass...

the beauty of the Herdlands.

Heh. Beauty. Where?

And who knew Kikanalo
could think-talk?

l just thought
they were dumb beasts.

Kikanalo still think the same
of tall green Matoran.

Hey, hey, hey, hey!
l'm a Toa.

Wait, wait. Tall Matoran.

Ask him if the Dark Hunters
trespassed with a tall Matoran.

Yes. They take many things to
the Place of Unending Whispers.

That must be where
they have Toa Lhikan.

They will show us the way.

Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

<i>Only a great Toa rider</i>

could tame a wild
Kikanalo beast.

Ooh! uh!

lt seems a great
Toa rider just got tamed.

uh!

Do not rely
on your memory.

Look beyond your history
and see what is.

Hey, l'm not a Rahi bat, OK?

l can see in the dark.

Oh!

Soon You'll be ready...

For a game of pin the tail
on the ash bear...

record-keeper. Ha ha ha!

Uh!

l could toil
at this task forever...

and still learn nothing
for the future.

Today You can learn...

that building
the tallest tower...

begins with the placement
of a single stone.

Build a tower?

A thinker would never
lay hands on stone.

They're too busy with
their heads in the stars.

A Toa's duty is to all Matoran,
regardless of village...

so You shall help
both your brothers.

<i>MATAU: Vahki--</i>

<i>hundreds of them.</i>

NOKAMA: That must be
where Toa Lhikan is.

What should we do?

How do we get in there?

l have a plan.

Oh!

uh!

That was a complete
waste of time!

Without self-discovery...

You will never find
your destiny.

This is every Toa's duty...

to the Great Spirit.

This whole thing was
a load of duty if You ask me.

Sit down, Whenua.

Taking orders from a Turaga
was one thing...

but from an overgrown
hammer swinger--

Sit down.

-Sit down.
-Aah!

Sit down now!

Aah! uh!

Aw, that's it.

You're history, Builder...

even if l don't know
how You did that.

Stop.

Whoa! How'd You do that?

Huh?

-your mask!
-your mask!

-your mask is glowing.
-That's amazing.

Ahem. l believe
it is time to depart.

Follow me, Vahki.

<i>MATAU: Hey!</i>

Hello!

Yaah! Ha ha ha!

Whoo! Whoo hoo hoo!

Yee hah hah!

Whoo-hoo!

Kreka, circle right.

Nidhiki, where'd the Toa go?

You must've let him slip-past.

Circle the other way-back.

Heh heh!

Huh?

Grr. Where did the Toa go?

You let him get by You?

Maybe he sneak-passed.

Hey, uh...

Aah!

Grr! Let go! Let go!

Where's the Toa?

How should l know?

l told You to go that way!

You told me to go the other way.

Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Shape-shifting!

Some mask powers
are worth the wait.

Hoo hoo hoo! Yee-haw!

<i>MATAU:
Yah! Ha ha ha!</i>

Whoo! Whoo hoo hoo!

Hey, Kikanalo,
who's your mas--

l mean, who's your partner?

Eww!

Ooh.

The chief said,
''Not bad...

''for flat-walkers.''

They will cover our herd tracks.

Toa Lhikan will be
forever in your debt.

lf they seal us in,
how will we get out?

NOKAMA: Don't wory.
We'll find a way.

Excellent.

Dume's mask has been useful.

Now for its final task.

The future will be mine...

even without the Mask of Time.

ONEWA: You?
l'm the one suffering here.

All that lies ahead is shadow.

Hey, it has to be better
than what's behind us.

Hmm!

your mask power.

Follow me, guuys.

our future just got
a whole lot brighter.

Hey, Whenua, can that mask
glow any brighter?

lt's already brighter
than You, brother.

l think we're going
the wrong way.

Relax. l know these tunnels
like the back of my hand.

Hold up. l heard something.

uh! Ooh!

Rrrah la la la la!

Hey, turn out
the bright light.

Matau?

Toa Matau...

to You, Whenua.

Shape-shifting?

Yeah, and You should hear Nokama
translating Kikanalo.

So, we've all discovered
our mask powers.

Everyone but me.

How did You know
we would be here?

We didn't.
We came for Toa Lhikan.

He's not here.

<i>Well</i>

Heh heh heh. Not exactly.

Toa Lhikan?

No, Vakama.

You are Toa.
l am Turaga Lhikan.

Oh.

Uh, but why didn't You
tell us who You were?

your task was to discover
who You are.

Only with such knowledge...

would your powers
reveal themselves.

Quick-stop.
Where did your power go?

lt lives on in all of You.

Tell me--

the heart of Metru Nui--

You have it safe?

Well, we're rescuing You now.

You are so misGuided.

l am not Metru Nui's heart.

The Matoran are.

Then l failed You.

l told You.
l'm a cross-wired freak...

chasing my dreams,
wasting everyone's time.

l'll never be a real Toa.

-Vakama--
-Wait.

We cannot help Vakama.

He must learn
to believe in himself.

Only then will
he find his destiny.

Aah!

Turaga Dume?

The true Turaga Dume.

As l feared...

<i>an imposter
is posing as a mask</i>

<i>we all trust.</i>

<i>MAKUTA: Bring me</i>

<i>the Mask of Time.</i>

lf this is Turaga Dume--

You don't want to know who's
really in control of Metru Nui.

Vahki! Run now,
talk later! Oh!

ln here! Unh!

Unh!

This won't hold 'em long! Unh!

<i>ONEWA: We've got
to find a way out!</i>

But our only exit is blocked.

<i>NUJU: Now what?</i>

Then we make our own.

Come on!

What about Turaga Dume?

He'll be safe until we return.

Now go!

uh!

Aah! Aah!

<i>Turaga DUME ON SPEAKER:
Matoran of Metru Nui:</i>

<i>You are requirred to gather
at the coliseum.</i>

<i>Rejoice</i>

for today will be
a momentous climax...

to your history.

Grip-tight!

<i>MATAU: Hey Nokamma,</i>

l see us taking
a romantic ride-drive.

Ha ha. And You believe
Vakama has odd visions.

Huh?

Ha ha ha! Hey, glow-head.

-Good job, brother.
-Huh?

<i>Turaga DUME: it is important
that You cooperate</i>

<i>with the Vahki enforcers.</i>

Where is everyone?

Quickly!

<i>Turaga DUME:
Too late, Toa.</i>

The shadow has arrived.

Makuta, You were sworn
to protect the Matoran!

l shall.

And when they awake...

l will be their great leader.

Deceit and self-interest...

will never be virtues
the Matoran honor.

How very bold.

Now even the Great Spirit...

<i>will soon</i>

<i>sleep.</i>

We must find the Matoran.

Whenua, what can You see?

<i>WHENUA: Matoran capsules--</i>

<i>thousands of them.</i>

They're down below!

Whoa!

Huh?

No!

Can we save them all?

We can't take them all now.

We'll return
for the others later.

Yes.

We must get them to safety.

Join me.

Toa!

Hey! Unh! Unh!

Remember me?

l'm trying to drive here!
Get off!

Toa or Turaga...

<i>your fate shall be
the same. Lhikan!</i>

Whoa! Hey! Get off!

Get Nidhiki.

Get Nidhiki.

Get Nidhiki.

Nidhiki.

Oh! Aah!

My thoughts exactly.

Whoa! Aah!

Hey! What's happening?

<i>MAKUTA: Come, Join me.</i>

<i>Be part of my power.</i>

Where to now?

Matau, take us over the edge.

Let's hope this thing floats.

Unh! uh!

Hey, it does float...

kind of.

You no longer need
to mask-make, Vakama.

lt's time You accepted
that You are a Toa.

Time--of course.

That's what
the false Turaga wanted.

Follow the light.

<i>VAKAMA:
Follow the light.</i>

<i>our destiny lies
in the light</i>

<i>beyond the great barrier.</i>

Oh, no.

your journey must end.

By the will
of the Great Spirit...

it has just begun!

Then perish...

in the real sea...

of protodermis.

Matau, stay true to the light.

Huh!

l got it!

uh!

Yeah! All right!

Nokama, quick-turn!

uh!

<i>Whoo!</i>

Hoo hoo hoo!
Ha ha ha!

Nuju! Get me up there!

Ruh!

uh!

Huh?

uh!

Whoa!

The Matoran!

Hmm...

The Mask of Time.

You are a great mask maker.

You could have many destinies.

Come.

Join my brothers...

<i>and me</i>

l desire just one
noble destiny...

more than any power
You can offer me.

Then accept your doom.

Lhikan!

That was meant for me.

No.

This is my lifetime's journey.

yours lies beyond.

Trust your visions.

l am proud to have
called You...

brother...

Toa Vakama.

My mask power.

Ah, at last.

Not this time.

No!

Without the Mask of Time...

it will take
a lifetime's journey...

to find both our destinies.

Only yours will be brief.

uh!

Come on.

Come on!

Over here!

uh!

Makuta!

MAKUTA:
l know where You are.

This way!

Show yourself.

Makuta!

Giving up so soon?

You cannot hide from me.

l don't need to. l'm a Toa.

No!

lf Toa Lhikan...

could not defeat me alone...

how could You?

Because he's not alone.

You tell him, sister.

That's right.

-Yeah!
-Yeah!

ALL: Unity!

Look!

<i>VAKAMA: Six spirit stars</i>

<i>NUJU: the great spirit
proclaims it.</i>

We are Toa!

Whoo-hoo!

We are Toa!

-Ha ha ha!
-Whoo-hoo!

Toa Lhikan sacrificed
his power for us.

Now we shall do
the same for them.

Vakama?

May the heart of Metru Nui
live forever...

for this is the island
of Mata Nui...

named in honor of
the Great Spirit.

<i>Turaga VAKAMA:
And so it was</i>

<i>as it is--</i>

<i>Matoran into Toa,</i>

<i>Toa into Turraga,</i>

<i>Turraga into legend,</i>

<i>Remembering deeds past</i>

Yeah!

<i>Turaga VAKAMA:
