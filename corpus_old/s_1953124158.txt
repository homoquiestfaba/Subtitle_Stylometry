In the worst-case scenario

you get a gorgeous little

(SHOWER RUNNING)

WESTON: <i>We could live</i>

We could go to Detroit.

Detroit?

I have six hours before I have

You want to go

WESTON: <i>I do.</i>

(KEYS CLATTERING)

So how long has he been
playing in your backyard?

We're working to get you
that answer right now.

Meaning you don't know.

No, meaning,
we're looking into it.

The guy goes rogue,
he spends nine years

selling out the Agency
to all takers.

To Russia, China, Iran,
you name it.

The guy is just not
going to prance

into an American consulate
without good reason.


WHITFORD:
All right, listen up.

Everybody off the phone.

Tobin Frost has
just waltzed his way

into a U.S. Consulate
in Cape Town, South Africa.

Now this man,
without question,

is one of the most notorious
traders that we've got.

Errington, call up
his background profile.

ERRINGTON: Tobin Frost was
recruited into the Agency in 1984.

He tested off the charts in aptitude
for psychological field work.

His first assignment was in
Lebanon, in January, 1985.

Three months later,
he captured and flipped

a high-ranking
Hezbollah leader.

<i>Over the next</i>
<i>several years,</i>

<i>Frost successfully questioned and recruited</i>
<i>many high-value individuals.</i>

He became known as an expert
manipulator of human assets,

and he literally rewrote
Agency interrogation protocols.

LINKLATER: Frost served
in many active theaters,

including Libya
from 1995 to 1998,

Jordan, 1998 to 2000.

During his tenure
in Jordan,

Frost was suspected of leaking
information to Mossad,

but nothing
was confirmed.

Ten years ago, Frost went off
the reservation completely.

<i>He currently</i>
<i>has no allegiances</i>

<i>and is wanted for espionage</i>
<i>on four continents.</i>

His last known sighting
is Hamburg, Germany, in 2011.

You know, Harlan, we should
interrogate Frost now.

Sweat him for
everything he's got.

Once he's stateside,
we have fewer options.

I have an interrogator in Yemen,
can be there in eight hours.

I already have a team in Jo'burg
that can be there in two.

We'll take Frost to the safe
house, interrogate him there.

My people are fully
capable of handling this.

This is Tobin Frost.

We'll go with Jo'burg.

Okay.

(BALL BOUNCING)

You must turn around.

Help. Help.

<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

I'm gonna dive into this,

and then hopefully I can

<i>Yeah, that sounds good.</i>

<i>Check all the traffic cameras,</i>

<i>Find out why Frost wanted</i>
<i>to go in that consulate to begin with</i>

We need to get Weston and
Frost out of South Africa.

Now, do we have any tactical
teams? Anything in play?

Yeah, I have assets in
Egypt, but they're in deep.

If I pull them out, that would
compromise two years' worth of work.

I can scramble a team

but it's going to

Weston is all we got.

I need to find out who this
Matt Weston is, right now.

FEMALE ANALYST:
<i>Matthew James Weston.</i>

<i>Born 02-24-82 to</i>
<i>Terry and Madeline Weston</i>

<i>in Port Washington,</i>
<i>New York.</i>

<i>An assault arrest,</i>
<i>one month after</i>

<i>both parents and</i>
<i>a younger sister</i>

<i>were killed in</i>
<i>a traffic accident</i>

<i>in which his</i>
<i>father's blood-alcohol</i>

<i>was twice</i>
<i>the legal limit.</i>

Yale, degree in Economics,
recruited out of Yale law.

<i>High marks in analytics</i>
<i>and linguistics at The Farm.</i>

<i>Excellent in</i>
<i>tradecraft skills.</i>

His girlfriend, Ana Moreau,
is a French national.

<i>He reported them</i>
<i>as having "close and continuing contact."</i>

<i>She's a second year resident</i>
<i>in the oncology department at Groote Schuur.</i>

WESTON: Get in that car.

FEMALE ANALYST: She accepted a
position with HÃ´tel-Dieu Hospital

in Paris,
starts in two weeks.

No known political
affiliations. She's clean.

I want you to post a car

And get NSA to cross-check their telephone

Nice to know who you're
talking to. What's your name?

You crushed my windpipe.

Well, you locked me

Come on, you're not NOC. You're
here under your real name.

What is it?

Weston, Matt.

All right.

How long you been
a safe house keeper?

Twelve months.

Happy birthday.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

Cape Town,
that's low-level detail.

You should have been
out of here by now.

Maybe I requested
the assignment.

(FROST CHUCKLES)

Or maybe Langley doesn't
trust you with anything else.

So, what's your plan?

Oh, let me guess.
Follow protocol.

Protocol states that
if your house is crashed,

you do an SDR to make sure
no one's following you.

Activate your GPS in your
Go-Bag, select another safe house.

You think I'm going to
let you just take me in?

I think you need
to shut up.

(FROST CHUCKLES)

I think you need to consider how your
house was attacked in the first place.

Have you done that, Matt?

They followed Kiefer. They
followed him from the consulate,

and that's how they
found the safe house.

Come on, you don't really
believe that, do you?

How did they know I was near
the consulate in the first place?

Hmm.

But I like this, you know.
You and me, figuring shit out.

Like the Hardy Boys.

That house was
a secure location.

Whoever crashed it

didn't stop by a gas station and ask for
directions to the nearest safe house.

They were invited.
Someone told them, Matthew.

Think about it.
Someone you know.

So you better ask yourself,
can you trust your landlord?

Go ahead, you're not
going to get in my head.

I already am
in your head.

They're going to
isolate you, Matt.

They're going to be real
nice to you at first.

They're going to put their arm
around you and tell you things like,

"You did a decent job, son.
We'll take it from here."

That's when you know
you're screwed.

Forget about me. They're
going to focus on you.

They're going to try and make
a connection between you and I.

So that if this
all goes wrong,

they'll have something
to fall back on

in their little
Senate hearings.

I'm not your
only enemy tonight.

WHITFORD:
<i>So, it's someone in-house.</i>

It's the only way this
thing could've happened.

We were
completely buttoned up.

I want a list of everyone
who knew about this.

Backgrounds, affiliations,

particularly any
connections with Frost.

Every movement right
up until this operation.

Your extraction team, how

My team had been

Well, Iâ€™m just trying to
get my head around this.

That will do, thank you.

See, what happens is, you
try to protect her with lies,

and then it starts
to add up.

At the safe house you said that
they'd kill me to get to you.

After a while,
even the truth...

Why?
...starts to sound like a lie.

You have something. You got
something that they want. What is it?

Is she a local?

Don't worry about her.
What is it?

Oh, it is a girl.

You'll keep covering your
tracks, she'll keep believing.

Because she wants to,
because she needs to.

That's why we exist, you
and me, that's our job.

To take advantage of that.

to believe.

To trust.

She's not going to
