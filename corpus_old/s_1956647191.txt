Like that.

This one can wrap you

A-ha.

And this one is for when

You just hold out your hand

And boom!

Glitter cloud!

And the bad guys
will leave you alone.

Oh! Because glitter makes
people happy?

Because the refracted light

causes the

Yeah, glitter makes

Let's try it out.

Remember how you told me

not to take apart

Feel me here, little man.

So, I'm out there...

That's what I do.
Mmm-hmm.

And the way I do it...

is to have my things

I expect my things to do.

Yep. Ow.

Like blow stuff up.

See, out there...

I gotta fight
fire with fire.

Because if I try to fight
fire with glitter...

I could get my face

But you didn't.

Because the kitty glitter
worked.

Kitty litter?
Glitter.

Kitty glitter.

It's scientifically proven
that watching kittens...

causes the

Glitter makes people happy.

This is a vile

(CHUCKLES SHEEPISHLY)


Look, I'm just saying
you can do more

And if I can

LANCE: There is no "we."

Uh, Agent Sterling.
Just...

Okay. Okay, okay.

For effect.

I'm totally

(DEVICE BEEPS)
It's called

(PEN WARBLING)
Boom. Mic drop.

Huh? Conceal this?


WALTER: I mean, you wouldn't

You wouldn't need

Wow. Dude.

That's a mess.

Don't worry yourself.

All right, cool, cool.
I'm gonna get outta here.

Wait, wait, wait. (GRUNTS)

(IN NORMAL VOICE) Look,

Nobody ever listens

but if you did...

together...

we could really
make a difference.

"Make a difference"?

Boy, I am the difference.

All I need from you

make me a grenade.

Can you do that?

There's a better way.
(SIGHS)

We're talking about

That's because
it isn't me.

This has to be wrong.

This is wrong!
I didn't...

Look, there was a guy
with a robot hand.

He stole the Assassin,

and he scanned my face
to frame me.

That sounds plausible,

and not like something
you just made up.

Sounds a little
Scooby-Doo, bro.

It isn't me!

Okay, so,
just to be clear...

there's a man with a robot
hand and Lance's face

who took the M9 Assassin.

We all feel good
about that?

Okay, case closed.
Let's go home.

You know what?

There's a bad guy

who needs to be stopped.
(CLICKS)

Couldn't agree more.

Huh. You're good.

You're entering Phase Two.

Fact, pigeons have
360-degree vision.

Now, nobody can sneak up
behind you.

Stop, girl. Come on.
WALTER: This is so great.

Pigeons can be found in every
major city around the world...

and no one notices them.

It's the most perfect form
a spy could take.

You better un-bird me
right now.

That's it. I'm not playing
with you. Un-bird...

I'm raising my voice.

I probably shouldn't be
raising my voice at you.

I guess you could imagine

I'm a little stressed

I need you
to un-bird me, Walter.

Mmm-hmm.
Of course.

I'll start working

Start?

Well, the formula was purely
theoretical until you...

You're gonna start?
You don't have an antidote?

(COOING)
Stop, girl, seriously.

Okay, okay.

So, you birded me,
and you can't un-bird me.

Technically, you kind of
birded yourself.

I'mma hurt this boy.

I'mma hurt this boy.
WALTER: No, no, look.

I know you're upset,
but everything's okay.

I called the Agency
and told them you're here.

You did what?

No, no, no, it's okay.

I didn't tell them
you're a bird.

Although I think
they're gonna

figure that out
pretty quickly. (CHUCKLES)



Yeah, there may be one or two
downsides to your new form.

Webster, open the door.

(CLICKS DOORKNOB)
Okay. Okay.

What... Why are you running
from the Agency?

Get off me!
I'm running... (GROANS)

because there's a bad guy

And thank you for that.
Thank you very much for that.

You're fired again.

Hey, everything go okay
in there?

I just found out that
number one and number two...

both come out
of the same place.

So, no.
Things are not okay.

Yeah. It's called
a cloaca.

It sounds weird and gross,

but having a cloaca
just means...

Dude!

I know what it means.

Saw it in the mirror.

I know you're not
in a good place right now...

but there are benefits
to being a pigeon.

Okay, so read
what used to be my lips.

You're only here,
because A,

I can't work a touchscreen
enough to eject you...

and B, you're supposed to be
working on something, correct?

Oh, the antidote.
Right. Sure.

Yeah, that's going to take
18 hours to render.

I'm stuck like this,
with this body, for 18...

Ooh, boy...

Whoo! Okay,
walk this one off.


You know,
being a pigeon

is actually way cooler
than it seems.

And if you just embrace
your new form,

you'll see
all the advantages.

Like, fact,
did you know

that pigeons can see
in slow motion?

Because, fact,
pigeons can fly

up to 92.7 miles
per hour.

(COOING)
And, fact, pigeons are

highly intelligent animals
who like to play games.

Oh, and, fact...

Fact! You should have kept
your seat belt on.

Whoo!


Fact, pigeons can see
ultraviolet light...

which is a broad
spectrum of light

the human eye
can't even see.

Fact, pigeons are
a flock animal,

which makes it easier
for them to...

You're a pigeon.
You can walk right past them.

Oh. Huh.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Just a regular old bird.

(LANCE IMITATES CAWING)

Uh, that's not

Till you grow a cloaca,

Okay, let's figure this out.
You and me. Let's go.

Let's brainstorm.
How we gonna find this nut?

Uh, you are gonna

But I'm your wingman.

Ooh, you know who needs

Go sit your narrow behind down

and I'mma go find Kimura.
Alone.

Oh, what is that
heavenly smell?


Oh, no.

Do not do it, Lance.


Mmm. Lance!
Have some dignity.

Walter, what is happening?

It must be some sort of latent

Why am I eating food
off of the ground?

Why does it taste amazing?

Ugh. No, I'm good.
Thank you.

Oh, wow.

My dude, seriously,
give me 10 feet.

Hey, no, human feet.
Back up.

Oh, no. (GROANS)
I wish I could unsee that.

This is huge.
They've made you part of their flock.

I'm not trying to be

Maybe I have something else

Walter, I do not need

Never will.

Can you push "20"

Here's how this works.

I ask the questions,

What?

What?

I don't know
how to answer that.

How did you get here?

KIMURA: Huh? How did I...

I'm not telling you anything.

(COOING)
Stop! Get off of me.

You sold the Assassin

Oh, and you think
I won't? Talk!

Sterling is here somewhere.
I want agents on every exit.

And everyone be careful.

This is Lance Sterling

Boy, I'm about to

Oh. Oh, tough guy.
Okay.

Then we do it
the hard way.

Walter,
I need a funnel,

Nickelback?

What?
But that would hurt him.

That's the whole point.

I know what to do.


Don't do that.
Ooh.

That's what
I'm talking about, Walter.

Go science on this fool!

Oh, yeah!

I'm gonna science
all over your face.

Please, don't!

Did you just give that
man a refreshing spritz?

It's a truth serum,
but yes,

it has a lavender

Watch.

Kimura,
what's your biggest secret?

I peed in the pool.

BOTH: That's a lot of honesty.

LANCE: Who is Robo Hand?
And why is he wearing my face?

I don't know who he is.

Then what do you know?

Well, I know
how to play the flute.

About Robo Hand!

I know he's on his way
to Venice right now

to steal the Agent Database.


Agent Database?
Database.

KIMURA: (MUFFLED)
Who says "database"?

Shut up.

He'll know the identities
of everyone at the Agency.

And once he does...

he'll use the Assassin
to eliminate all of them.

Not if I stop him first.
(LOVEY COOS)


Block the door.
We need something heavy.

I'm heavy.

Of course I'm pulling!
Why aren't you pushing?

But that doesn't make sense!

Beckett is just some nobody

Well, according

I can hardly feel my legs!

But I'm here

I know you do, man.

But it's a fantasy.

When the bad guys hit you,

You're a girl!

Oh! Excuse me?

Of course, of course.

That's why

I used Lovey's DNA in the serum.

And that helps us how?

Huh?

(IN ENGLISH)
Oh, right. Yeah.

(MUSIC STOPS)
(CLEARS THROAT)


But I saw...

How did you...

Oh, you know,
one of my weird gadgets.

The inflatable hug.

Thought I lost you, man.

I'll always have
your back, Lance.

That's what it means
to be a team.

It's something I learned
a long time ago.

From your mom?

You're a good friend, Walter.

And, hey, (SIGHS) I'm sorry
for shooting you in your neck.

I'm sorry for the cloaca.

(CLEARS THROAT)

So, what's your plan
to stop this guy?

Nope. Not my plan.

Time to do it your way.

My way?

Oh, yeah. We about
to Walter-ize this thing.

Well, in that case...

we're gonna need
a bigger flock.

You're calling Marcy,
aren't you?

Yep.
Tell her I said hi.


Let's get weird.
Boom.



KILLIAN: Nowhere to run
from this, Lance.

LANCE: Listen, I'm sorry about
what happened in Kyrgyzstan.

But we are stuck in this
good guy-bad guy vortex.

We do not have
to do it like this.

Yeah, bit late for that.

LANCE: It's not.

We're both just people
who make mistakes.

We can work this out, man.
That's it.

(OVER RADIO) <i>Almost there.
You're doing great.</i>

I mean, come on.

We can break this cycle.

(BEEPS)
Got it. I'm connected.

Nobody else
has to get hurt.

better than anyone.

Someone always gets hurt.

Not today-day.

(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING)

You brought
your own soundtrack?

We like to make an entrance.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

Huh?

Oh.



Huh?

MARCY:
Would you look at that?

There's a man
with a robot hand

wearing your face...

who took the M9 Assassin.

Guess I owe you
an apology.

LANCE:
Okay. Go ahead.

No, that was it.
That was the apology.

Oh. I accept.


But you gotta admit,
it was a little Scooby-Doo.

Oh, 100% Scooby-Doo.

I'm gonna make this hurt!

Okay, come on through.

You are safe here. Come on.
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

Is that everyone?

Director, we've got
unknown incoming.

Approaching fast.

Oh, this is bad.

Lock this place down.


(POWERING DOWN)

We're sitting ducks.

Walter hacked his hand.

We gotta buy him some time
to shut down the drones.

Got it. What kind of
firepower we talking?

(BAG SQUEAKS)

Just go along with it.

Take your best shot.



WALTER: <i>No, no, no,
that's binder bubbles.</i>

<i>Push the button on the back.</i>

Button on the back,
button on the back!

Bubbles?

Oh, you gotta let me
try that.

WALTER: <i>That's a collide-oscope.
Throw it.</i>



(BOTH GRUNTING)

Splat-a-pult. Prism spray.
Hypno-stars.

Snorepedo. Scream Team.

Well, what have we
got to lose?

(DEVICE WHIRRING)

11 o'clock.

12 o'clock.
Half past 2! 4:30!

WALTER: <i>Security blanket.</i>
(SOLDIER GASPS)

WALTER: <i>It's upside down.</i>

FEMALE HUGGER VOICE:
<i>I'm a hugger.</i>

SOLDIER: Whoa.



Nice shot.


Thank you?

Walter, gonna need
a reload, buddy.

WALTER:
<i>Ask and you shall receive.</i>

Are those pigeons
wearing tiny backpacks?

DEVICES: <i>Yay!</i>

Now, that's hot.
That's hot.

I call it Fifty Shades of Yay!

Oh, come on, now!

LANCE: You ready
to tap out yet?


Gadget lab.

Get to the gadget lab!
Grab every weapon you can!

Stop! Get back!

Oh, no.

DEVICES: <i>Yay!</i>

FEMALE HUGGER VOICE:
<i>I'm a hugger.</i>

(BOTH GRUNTING)

can't take much more of this.

You keep doing your thing
and I'll do mine.

Yeah, well, your thing
seems to be

a lot easier
than my thing.

We have
different skillsets.

That's what makes us
such a great team.

Dude.


(ALL GRUNTING)

(SNEEZES) Excuse me.
Ugh.

Whoo.
Why do I smell lavender?

We just got spritzed.

Uh-oh. Truth serum.

I have five cats,

each named after a member
of New Kids on the Block.

Oh, I love New Kids.

Jon, Joey, Jordan,
Donnie, and Danny.

I really wanna
hurt you right now.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

You.

What...
What are you doing?

I'm not
telling you anything.

I'll tell you
what he's doing.

He's gonna hack
into your claw

and shut down
your drones.

Wow, this stuff
really works.



No, no, no.

(GRUNTS)
No!

(SCREAMS, GRUNTS)



Whoa!
I'm coming, Walter.

(LANCE YELLING)

(LANCE STRAINING)

Almost there. Don't let go.
Please don't let go.


(SCREAMING)
Walter!


Walter.

Come on, come on.

(ALL CLAMORING)

AGENT:
Somebody do something.

(CHUCKLES)
(GRUNTS)

If you shut 'em down now,
you'll kill us both.

And you're no killer.

No. I'm a hugger.

(BEEPS)
What?

(WALTER GRUNTS)

WENDY: <i>One day, your gadgets
are gonna keep the world safe.</i>



(BOTH SCREAMING)

(POWERING DOWN)

(ALL CHEERING)


Yes!
Yes!

Never wash
that hand again!


(LANCE EXCLAIMING)

I got you, Walter!

Lance? What are you...
(STRAINING)

WALTER: It's okay.

It's okay.

You can't do this alone.

I am not alone!

(COOING)
Lovey?

(LAUGHING IN RELIEF)

Come on, birds!

Fly!

(BOTH GRUNTING)



Walter.

(COUGHS)
(SIGHS AND CHUCKLES)

What does internal
bleeding feel like?

This.
It feels like this.

Oh, come here.

No, no, no. No hugs.

You gonna make me

lay an egg or something
in front of Marcy.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

(DISTANT SQUEAKING)

(DEVICE BEEPING)
Huh?

(SQUEAKING CONTINUES)

EYES: He saved him.

I think I need a vet.

Once I can move again,
I'll turn you back into a man.

MARCY: Sterling.

You're a bird?

Uh, hey, Marcy.

That's why
I couldn't find you!


Whoa, you're a bird.
That is messed up.

LANCE: It's weird, right?

This is amazing.

We did it.

We took down the drones,
beat the bad guy,

saved countless lives.

We are so gonna get
our jobs back!

So, triple fired.

Yeah, man, that's gotta
be some kind of record.

I really didn't see
that coming.

Well, we did break a bunch of
laws, and defied orders...

and, I mean, committed
a little bit of treason.

Oh, right, yeah,
the treason.

Forgot about
the treason.

Hey.
It doesn't matter, man.

Look around.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Your mother would be
so proud of you right now.

You kept
all those people safe.

And you did it your way.

But you also did this.


I'll figure that out.
Sorry.

You know,
this gluten-free stuff

is really starting
to grow on me.


So, what do we do now?

Oh, we could...
(WALTER YELPS)


Marcy?

WALTER: (MUFFLED) Okay,
I can't see or hear...

but my other senses are
elevated, so you... Ow!

<i>Agent Sterling,
I apologize for the theatrics.</i>

No, you don't.

You should have seen your
face when we grabbed you.

I didn't make a face.

No one's ever looked
more scared.

<i>Are you two finished?</i>

WALTER: We are gonna
be okay, Lance!

Use your baby hand
to pick the lock!

<i>Can you please
take that off him?</i>

Okay, and you can...
(CLEARS THROAT)

Oh, hey. Hey, guys.

(CLEARS THROAT)
Is this about the treason?

Joy, what is going on?

<i>We realize
we were wrong about you.</i>

<i>You're the future
of this agency,</i>

<i>and we want you
to lead a new team.</i>

<i>A highly covert global...</i>

LANCE: Let me stop you
right there.

I'm not leading nothing,

unless my man
Walter's on the team.

Um...

I think
she's talking to Walter.

Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we...
Just put that down.

Sometimes,
he talks for me,

I'll talk for him,
'cause we a team.

Me?

<i>We need people like you.</i>

<i>People who can help the
Agency do things a new way.</i>

<i>What do you say?</i>

Looks like we gonna
need some glitter.

Team Weird?

LANCE: (CHUCKLES)
Team Weird.
