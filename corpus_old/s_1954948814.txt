[Man speaking German]

[Anneliese speaking German]

[Anneliese screaming
and shouting]

Gruber: Nothing.
I don't know.

Landers:
Has that ever happened?

They knew
we were coming, yes?

Yeah.

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

Parker:
What are they saying?

They don't want us
to come in.

Landers: I thought you had
spoken to them already.

Let's just go in.

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

Come on. Move in.

[Speaking German]

Hello.
I am Dr. Landers.

I'm Dr. Ken Landers.

[Speaking German]

Dr. Landers.
Kenneth Landers.

And we're here
to help Anneliese with...

We're here to see
Anneliese.

We understand that
she is not doing so well.

Gentlemen,
you had two years...

She was under
medical care...

And you didn't
achieve nothing.

We understand that she has not
been taking her medication...

And therefore...

Her medication
didn't help her then...

And it's not helping now.

Well, she had two years.

What do you want?

Father, what
we need to do now...

Is do some medical tests.

We can take her into town.

At the hospital there...

She's not going
to leave this house.

We can do certain tests
right here today...

No. Dear, doctor.
Dear, doctor...

To determine if she's
having seizures...

Because that
is the issue here.

She's obviously having
psychotic episodes.

She had psychotic episodes
when she was in your care...

And you didn't do anything
to help her.

When we're fearful of
is the installation of this...

And have you been
able to help her?

[Overlapping conversations]

I'm sorry.
I don't speak German.

We're not leaving.

Dr. Gruber has arranged
for us to do this...

And we need...


Oh, shit!

Oh, my god.

Dr. Gruber,
did she look like this...

The last time you saw her?

No, not at all.

[Speaking German]


Landers: Oh, my god.

Let me examine her.

Anneliese?
Anneliese?

[Speaking German]

Good lord,
when did she last sleep?

This girl is exhausted.

No wonder she's having
episodes like this.

Dr. Gruber,
she looks awful...

As if she
hasn't slept in...

Aah!

[Praying in German]

[Overlapping conversations]

She could be seizing
right now.

Get her to bed.
We can give her sedative.


Come... hold it.
Get her...

Keep on her, Steve.

Keep...


Steve, get on her.
Come on.

Parker: Holy shit.

My name is Friedrich Gruber.

I am the local doctor...

And Anneliese Michel
has been my patient...

Ever since
she was a small child.

I am very concerned
about her case.

Her parents came to me several
years ago with Anneliese.

She was suffering
from headaches at the time...

And that was unexplained.

And since then
we gave her some medication...

And now, oh.

Parker: All right,
doctor, we're rolling.

I'm Dr. Kenneth Landers.

I focus my research...

On the study
of grand mal epilepsy...

And associated disorders.

And I've been brought over
by Dr. Gruber...

To consult on this rather
remarkable case.

We had a written contract...

Stating that we could come,
take a look...

And if we felt, we could
take her back to the hospital.

Now all of a sudden,
they say no.

Parker: Well, why... if
you have a written contract...

Exactly. So I said,
you know...

Either you let us in
and we can...

Or we take this matter
to the authorities.

Is that what you're going to do?
What's next?

Yes.

We will take it
to the authorities...

If need be.

I have been documenting...

Epilepsy and again,
related disorders...

For many years
in the United States...

And when we heard
about this case...

We realized that it might be
the perfect opportunity...

To study something
in the field...

Which is rather difficult
to find test subjects for.

In this case,
what I believe is happening...

Is a perfect case...

A psychotic state...

Often that resembles
schizophrenia...

With all the associated
manifestations of that.

It presents
in exactly the same way...

As classic schizophrenia...

But we believe
it's directly related...

To seizure activity.

So we're here at the home
of Anneliese Michel...

Not sure which.

My name's Steve Parker.

I'm here with Dr. Landers
from the university...

And we're...
at the invite of Dr. Gruber.

And I think the reason
we've come this whole way...

Is because there appears
to be things happening here...

That we haven't
encountered before.

There are priests here
doing an exorcism.

The parents clearly
don't want us here.

We just got here
a couple hours ago...

And already some pretty
trippy shit's happening.

When we walked up the path...

We turned around and there
were several dead crows.

[Crows caw]

Parker: Oh, shit.

Sandy: Oh, my god.

Gruber: Come along.
Come along.

As we came in the house...

Anneliese appeared...

And proceeded to urinate
on the floor...

As well as lick up
her own urine.

Aah!

Certainly me,
and even Dr. Landers...

Seemed to be affected by it.

I haven't ever
seen him be affected...

In quite the same way
before.

I need the CCG cameras
up in every corner.

I don't want to miss
any angles, ok?

Get every single thing from
this freak show that I can.

Ok. Where
do you want the monitors?

In the kitchen.

Parker: All right.
Get some "B" Roll here...

Of the house.

A lot of religious imagery.

Man, they really dig
their crosses.

The dining room.

Very well-kept house.

Oh.

Hey.

Oh!


Steve! Steve!

What's Steve doing?

Gruber: The picture's
upside down.

Get out of the way.

You want to explain this?

The sign is, too.

And I expect
you want me to believe...

That this is the work
of the devil.

Oh!
Oh, my god!

What happened
to the lights?

Is there a light switch
up here?

Come up here, Steve.
Get up here.

Steve, push
through, please.

Into the bedroom.

Come on.
Go, go, go, go, go.

Dr. Gruber.

She's seizing.
Give me your stethoscope.

Give me
your stethoscope now.

Hurry, doctor.

[Speaking German]

Ok, 20 milligrams Diazepam.
We're going to sedate her.

We're going
to sedate her quickly.

Bring it here.

[Speaking German]

She's not an animal.

All right.
And... come on.

Go.

Aah!


Aah!

Bring the tape, doctor.
Hurry up!

Tape it quickly!

[Speaking German]


Motherfucker!

Touch me again, I'll
rip out your fucking eyes!

Does she speak English?

[Speaking German]

What?

Stop! Stop!

Stop!

Wait!

Keep filming.

Out! Out!

[Speaking German]

You, too. Out, out,
out, out, out. Get out.

Out.

[Praying in German]

Aah!

[Praying in German]


Parker: All right, pastor
Renz, we are rolling.

Let me interrupt you.

I am a father,
not a pastor.

I'm a catholic,
not a protestant.

Right on.
What should I call you?

[Speaking German]
Father.

Father? Ok, father Renz,
we are ready?

We are ready.

My name is father Renz.

I am here
to conduct an exorcism...

As it was requested
by the family.

Aah!

[Praying in German]

Parker: And the doctors
being here.

How do you feel about that?

They have served
their purpose.

They had over two...
almost three years...

To treat
and to try their art.

Believe me,
I am not against medicine...

And medical science.

It has its place.

It has outlived
its usefulness.

We've seen some pretty
trippy things.

How does a demon do that?

How does a demon
manifest normally?

It could be as simple
as speaking in tongues.

All of a sudden,
the person uses language...

They had no way of knowing.

We have had instances
where all of a sudden...

The person speaks Aramaic.

That is the language...

We barely have any written
language from that time.

Anneliese, she grew up
in a small Bavarian village.

How could she speak Greek,
fluent Latin...

English even, or Italian?

How could she do that?

Outside of Bavaria.


Motherfucker!

This is definitely demonic.

These are manifestations,
outbursts...

Where the demon
wants to manifest itself...

To the people around.

It's, for lack
of a better word...

A scare tactic.

Parker: Do you know
what's happening to her?

I cannot say for sure...

Without proper
examinations.

But they won't let us.

That is what makes me
so frustrated here.

You were up there.
How can you explain that?

There could be
many explanations.

The bed rocking,
a small earthquake, perhaps?

A small earthquake?

Yeah, a small earthquake.

Come on, you expect
someone to believe that?

There are all kinds
of explanations.

But without being able to...

You know,
to have the psycho...

You must have some idea
what happened up there.

As a scientist,
explain it.

Prove to me...


Like that.
What is that?

That is Anneliese again...

Jumping up and down
on the bed.

But that's not what
happened up there.

She wasn't
jumping up and down.

You saw what happened.
You were there.

She was writhing around
like she was...

Like having a seizure
or something.

Yeah, but how can you
explain what happened?

The bed wasn't having
a seizure. Nothing else...

How do you explain...
that was freaky shit.

How do you explain that?

Well, I can't
at this moment.

Parker: We're rolling,
Dr. Landers.

Sandy, you rolling?

Camera's all set
and rolling.

Parker: Ok. That's some pretty
trippy shit last night, Dr. Landers.

Why don't we start
with that, ok?

With Dr. Gruber?

From our perspective...

What we saw last night...

Was a young girl
writhing on a bed.

So we gave her a sedative,
and she was able to sleep.

And may I just say...

And I have no idea...

Were caused by...

And we need to help her.

She hasn't been sleeping.

And we want to help.

My dear doctor, yes,
your sedative helped.

It put her out.

The point is it stopped
the seizures as well.

Gruber: What has your exorcisms done
for her? Absolutely nothing.

Absolutely nothing?

The catholic Church
has for hundreds of years...

Been doing things
incorrectly.

They have believed...

That the world was flat
at one point, not round.

They did not think that
the Earth went around the sun.

And they still believe
in demons and ghosts.

Parker: You know, father, that I
was brought here by the doctors.

And they feel that
you're basically...

You're killing this girl.
What do you say to that?

Nonsense.

She's not doing very well.

Well, what are they doing?

Pumping her full
of sedatives?

This is going
to sustain her life?

I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

That's what I see.

Gruber: I gave you
the courtesy to finish.

Extend that same
courtesy to me.

That is blasphemy.

There are many powers...

That neither you
not I understand.

It has gone into
a realm of faith.

All you can do...

Is explain this
through mumbo-jumbo...

Ghosts and devils.

The point is
the drugs did help...

And we can
help her more if we...

Speaks a foreign
language? Speaks...

Obviously she heard it
somewhere.

I can't explain that...

But I don't need
to explain that.

I spent my time teaching Greek
to somebody up there.

Are you
out of your mind?

She heard it on television
or on the radio.

Father,
medical research shows...

That people
who are having seizures...

Often speak
in other languages...

That they've only heard
a tiny fraction of their lives.

That's why we had them
cite religious text...

That they wouldn't
even understand.

I have no idea
what she was saying.

That's not the point.
The point...

Enough! Enough!

Enough!

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

Landers: What are they
saying, doctor?

What are you saying?

[Speaking German]

Yes, you know, I would
like to say this.

I want you to get this.
This is important.

Do you have any idea
where you are?

I think not.

I am the spiritual leader
in this community...

In this area.

This exorcism...

Was not only ordained...

But was ordered
by a diocese.

By the bishop.

So you want to go
to the authorities...

Because they will laugh
you out of the courtroom.

This is
a different world...

You have stepped into.

Get this in your head.

It is beyond you
and the science.

In this area...

The politicians
come after the Church.

And now we are done.

Thank you.
[Speaking German]

Landers: We only want
to help her.

Gruber: Anneliese!

I think it's complicated...

By the so-called
treatments...

The exorcisms
that have been going on.

I think we also have a case...

Of what I would term
doctrinaire induction.

I think that Anneliese
is being fed information...

On how to behave...

On how to have
these episodes...

By the very fact...

That the priests
have been telling her...

That she's possessed.

And what the devil does...

Is exactly what
she then manifests.

And I believe that
it's a complicated case...

But I don't think
it's too complicated...

For us to unravel.

Parker: So for the camera,
tell me your names.

I am Joseph Michel
and this is my wife Anna.

Ok, and what's happening
with your daughter?

What's going on?

Well, she is very sick.

She... six years ago...

She had...
what you say... a fit...

And then she began
to make many noises...

And to cry out.

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

She had an epileptic, um...

Parker: Seizure?

Seizure. Yeah.
And, uh...

[Speaking German]

She began to...
how you say...

S... to a s...

My name is Ernst Eich.
[Speaking German]

Parker: Please try
the best you can...

In English.
In English, please.

My name is pastor Eich...

And I'm the priest
here in this community.

My English is a little
rusty, of course...

That's ok.

I used to speak
in university.

It's my first time...
are you of TV, I think?

I'm not sure.
Your camera is rolling.

Parker: So if that's
the case...

Why do you have
the priests here?

I mean, that sounds like...

Didn't you take her
to the doctor?

[Speaking German]

We took her
to the doctors, yes...

But they gave her
a strong medication.

But this did not help, so...

[Speaking German]

And quite all of a sudden...

She began to curse us...

And to, um... um...

To fight us, you know.

But that's... why is that
demonic possession?

Why isn't that just
a girl acting out?

Why do you have
the priests here?

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

That was not everything.

[Speaking German]

Yeah, that was not
everything.

She urinated on the ground...

And she began
to play with that...

And we didn't know what
to do with this, you know.

[Speaking German]

Despite the medication, she
began to call on the devil...

And call out.

[Speaking German]

There had to be
something else that was wrong...

That we had
to do something else.

Parker:
And do you believe...

She's possessed
by the devil?

[Speaking German]

We are a religious family,
we are a catholic family...

And we believe in god.

Parker: So you're still upset
that the scientists are here?

Do you think that
they're going to harm her?

They want to help.
It appears they want to help.

Well, you know,
the intention's good.

I do understand
the intention's very good...

But it doesn't work.

You don't think
it has a place.

No, not here.



What did she say?

[Speaking German]

What's she saying?
What does that mean?

She's praying to the
virgin Mary.

She has to suffer
for all the sins.


Anneliese.

Anneliese.

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]


Preacher wants to fuck me.


[Speaking German]

Get that shit out of my face!

[Anneliese
singing softly in German]

Give me one second.

Yeah.
Is that rolling?

Books are flying everywhere
and it's cold.

I'm gonna take
that camera up there.

She's throwing books?

No, they're flying
by themselves.

[Overlapping conversations]

Steve, calm down.
What are you...

I just had a revelation
about all this.

She is convinced
that the virgin Mary...

Is speaking to her
and telling her...

The exorcisms
need to continue...

So the world may learn about
possessions and demons.

Father Renz! Father
Renz! Come and see.

Come and see. Quickly!

Steve, bring the camera.

Anneliese.

Landers:
We're going in there.

Come on.

I'm not going
back in there.

Don't tell me
what to do.

I'm not going
back in there.

Come on.
This is your job.

Get in here.

Sandy: Shit!

Shit.
Oh, my god.

[Overlapping conversations]

Aah!

[Praying in German]

Anneliese, come here.

No!

I know you don't
believe in me.

You can't explain everything
with your medicine.

You can take your medicine
and shove it up your ass!


No!

Aah!

[Praying in German]

No. No. Oh, god.

Steve,
are you getting this?

Yeah.
Not me, her.

[Praying in German]

[Heart beating]

[Praying in Latin]

Parker: If the priests
are here for nine months...

And she's not better, then
that's not helping, either.

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

There's no other choice.

When she calls
for the devil...

And the holy water, um...

Burns her...

That doesn't make sense.

You must have other options...

Other things
you haven't tried yet.

What else can we do?

Well, right now we have
about 60, 62 treatments...

And in my opinion...

It will work eventually.

It's very complicated.
It's very subtle.

Parker:
Well, she looks...

I mean, for lack
of a better term...

Pretty fucked up.

It doesn't appear
to be working to me.

Well, I wouldn't use...

But it's getting better
for sure.

Why do you think she's
resisting your exorcism?

At this point,
I don't know.

I don't think that it is
coming from the person.

It is either that there
is a very strong demon...

Holding on to her...

You have to remember,
this is not a psychic thing.

This is the body,
the mind, the spirit...

Everything
is involved in this.

Everything is possessed,
for lack of a better word.

Parker: So you think
the exorcisms will help?

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

It will take
a little bit longer...

But we must
believe in this.

This is our faith.

We put it in...
what is it?

God's hands.

[Speaking German]

God will stay with us.
Stay by us.

[Anneliese speaking German]

[Anneliese shouting]


[Anneliese speaking German]

Aah! [Speaking German]

[Shouting in German]

Renz: What you
have heard now...

Is part of what
we have recorded...

Over the last
three or four months.

What we can discern
to this point...

Is that there are three
demonic entities involved.

One claims to be
the emperor Nero.

The second one...
very disturbing...

Appears to be
Adolph Hitler.

It comes through...

The verbiage
that she uses...

From what I understand.

The diocese, the bishop...

And even his cardinalship
in Munich.

People in Rome
are concerned about this.

This entity
appears to be Satan himself...

Or one of his
highest disciples.

It comes through
and totally takes her over...

And violates her
and everything around her.

Now, what you will hear
from now on...

Is much more disturbing than
what you've heard before...

So be aware.

[Anneliese shouting]



Sandy:
Shh! Something's up.

Landers:
What's the matter?

Sandy:
What is that?

Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

Steve!

Got to get the
16 millimeter.

Aah!

[Praying in German]


Bastard!

[Speaking German]

Sandy:
I'm not going up, Steve.

Shit.

I mean, that was freaky.

How do you explain that?

I don't know how to
explain what happened.

Parker: I mean, I'm not
a scientist, but that isn't...

Come on, you expect
someone to believe that?

There are all kinds
of explanations.

I don't believe
that it's demons.

I don't think that
anything is happening here...

Except some of the admittedly
amazing things...

That the human body
can cause to happen.

Parker:
That was freaky shit.

How do you explain that?

Well, I can't
at this moment.

What's the word
I'm looking for?

Manifestation.
I'm sorry?

I don't know the word.

I know you don't.

Yes, I am.
You done?

[Man speaking German]

[Anneliese speaking German]

[Anneliese growling]

[Anneliese shouting]

[Speaking German]

[Speaking German]

[Shouting in German]

[Speaking German]

You must help us.

These demons, they are
killing our daughter.

We cannot use our...

[Speaking German]

Joseph: They are killing
our daughter.

This demon, you know,
you must help her, yeah?

You will help her?

[Renz speaking German]

Please, please, can we have
a moment of privacy?

Thank you.

Steve, back off.

If we can take her
to the hospital...

We can feed her
in the hospital...

And we can
make her well again.

[Joseph
speaking German]

Gruber:
We can feed her intravenously...

In the hospital.

Landers: It won't hurt her.
It will only help her.

Renz:
Gentlemen, please.

At this point...
[speaking German]

[Anna speaking German]

Joseph:
Can you help her?

Landers: Yes.

[Renz
speaking German]

What are they saying?

The cardinal and the bishop
are praying for her.

[Speaking German]

They have to have faith.
It is the most important thing.

Cocksucker's gonna stab me
with those needles.

What she's projecting
is a classic psychosis...

I understand that...

And have her tested.

[Speaking German]

Anneliese,
you have to...

[Speaking German]

Does eating help
your little sister, huh?

What?

Couldn't kill her cancer,eich
could it, doctor?

That's your fairy
medicine, wasn't it?

How do you know
about that?

[Speaking German]

How do you know
about that?

How do you know?

How do you know?

Oh, my god!

Renz: This is how
the demon works.

This is how
he gets through.

You want me to eat,
don't you? Huh?

Let's eat, shall we?

Sandy: Oh, god!

You are right, doc.

I feel much stronger now.

Sandy: Let me
out of here!

Let me out of here!

What went on in here?

Huh?

My assistant's in the bathroom
puking her guts out.

[Snaps fingers]

You listening?

Next time you want
to get naked...

Put on a little show,
you let me know.

I'll be sure
to be there.

Hey?

Crazy bitch.

[Speaking German]

What are you saying,
doctor?

I'm saying that I am not sure...

Exactly what all
is going on here...

But I do know that I'm
going to stop these exorcisms.

Parker: Jesus.


Parker: Help!

You like to watch?

Fucking watch this.

[Gruber choking]

Landers: Steve? Steve?

Landers: What's
going on? What?

What's happening?

Stop! Anneliese,
stop it.

Anneliese,
look at me. Please.


Anneliese.
Anneliese, please.

Look at me, please.

Anneliese,
you're killing him!

Stop it! Stop it!

Doctor,
I'm not killing him.

[Praying in German]

I killed him!


[Praying in German]

Hey?

[Speaking German]

Sandy: What?

[Speaking German]

I don't understand
German. I'm sorry.


Please help me.

Please help me.

It hurts.

Ok. Ok.

I can loosen them up
a little bit.

Ok?

Please.

Why did you kill
that doctor?

Why would
you do that?

No. No, I don't.

I don't do this.

I don't know who,
but I don't do this.

Ok.

Ok, just
a little bit, ok?

Aah! No, let go.
Let go.

Please.

You really are
a stupid bitch.

What?

Please let go.
Please let go.

Ow! Ow!

Only usually
you're the one in it...

And the person in charge
is tucking you in.

What?

Didn't you love it when
he used to come to your room...

And tuck you in?

Or should I say fuck you?

You used to love the way
your father touched you, huh?

Stop.

When you were sitting
at the kitchen table.

Remember that Thanksgiving
when you were at your grandmother's?

And your mother was sick, so you got
to stay in bed with daddy.

No, no.
Stop it!

1964 was a good year
for you, wasn't it?

But then it all got worse
when you got older.

Now every time
you date a man...

It's not the same, is it?

Why are you
doing this?

You're too old now.

Nobody will love you
the way he did.

It will never feel the way it did
when you were little.

A spent whore.

You're nothing but
a piece of trash now.

You're well past your prime.

If I were you...

I would simply put myself
out of my misery.

I don't understand how you could look
at yourself in the mirror...

All old...

Sagging breasts now.

You're nothing but
a piece of trash.

Who would love you?

No one would love you.

You've been used up.


That's right. Go.

Go, Sandy.


My dear doctor...

You were privy
to more of this...

Than anybody else
around here.

The point is I know
what happened last night.

At least I saw what
happened last night.

I don't even
understand it...

But I know
that a man is dead...

And we have to call
the authorities.

Now is the time that the authorities
have to be brought in.

I can't do it
by myself.

I don't speak
the language.

I don't know
who they are.

My good doctor, listen
to me for a moment.

If the authorities are
brought in at this point...

Neither you nor I
will be able to help her.

They will take her
to a place...

That is beyond our reach...

And neither you nor I
will be able to help her.

I want to take her somewhere
where she can be helped.

She is a danger
to herself.

Doctor.

If you don't
let me do this...

I am taking Steve
and Sandy...

And we are going
to leave.

That's what
we're going to do.

Then you are the one
that is losing.

It's not a matter
of losing.

You need
to understand something.

I was ordered
to perform this exorcism...

From the highest level
within the Church.

This did not come out
of my little world.

This was...
let me finish, please.

This was something...

That was brought
in front of the courier...

And they brought it
in front of the cardinals.

There is a small group
of cardinals in Rome.

They specifically deal
with these instances.

These decisions
are not taken lightly.

They are made
at the highest level in Rome.

Do they know that
somebody has died?

Yes, people die
in these situations.

People die
in these situations?

What does that mean?

This is
a normal thing?

We're not dealing
with normal circumstances.

When do you stop, then?
When do you stop it?

When?


Is that her?

I think it...

[Speaking German]

[Glass breaks]


You need to understand.

This is a duel thing
that is happening.

It is not only the person
that is possessed...

That is affected by this.

Gets very involved,
gets very drained by this.

It involves everything
of a person.

When I conduct an exorcism...

It is my body,
my mind, and spirit.

There are instances...

Died in the process.

[Shouting in German]

Father Renz.

[Shouting in German]

Landers:
Open the door.

What are you
doing to her?

She's doing penance.

What do you mean, penance?

600 genuflects.

600? What are you
talking about?

She's needs it.

She'll blow her knees out, father.
You can't do that.

Then she may need
a wheelchair.

Father, listen to me.

I'm staying here only
to take care of her now...

And we are going
to the authorities.

We're leaving, father.
You hear me?

[Speaking German]

[Anna speaking German]

Dr. Landers?

Eventually she's gonna collapse,
and you pick her up.

Down again.

Sandy's dead.

Priests have got the house.

It's pretty hard sometimes.

[No sound]

It's imperative that
we get her to a hospital...

That we get her tested...

And that we save this girl...

From a downward spiral...

Which she's obviously on.

[Anneliese growling]

[Anneliese indiscernible]

[Renz speaking German]


Parker: We have the picture
that fell on Sandy.

Pretty trippy...

But not
necessarily demonic.

Going downstairs.

I'm going to proceed
downstairs.

The crosses...
still upside down.

No one can really explain
that, but...

Strange phenomena.

So I've been told.

Same with the pictures.

And I'm going to go ahead
and go downstairs...

And catch some footage
of the...

Hey, there, girl.

You're foxy.

What are you doing here?

You're not
supposed to be here.

Oh, you gonna
put on a show?

You want it, don't you?
Crazy bitch.

Go ahead.
It's all right.

I thought...
ok. All right.

Oh, good god.

Fuck.

All right.

No. No. No.

Aah! No!

Aah!


Aah!

I'm so sorry
I couldn't help you.

I'm so sorry
about everything.

I want to get this
on tape.

I studied science
and medicine my whole life.

I thought I could
explain everything...

Including death.

And three people
have died here...

And I don't know why.

And I should have
put a stop to it...

Weeks ago.

It's my fault.
I should have stopped it.

I should have
put an end to it.

But I'm going to. I'm going
to put an end to it...

Aah!

Aah!
