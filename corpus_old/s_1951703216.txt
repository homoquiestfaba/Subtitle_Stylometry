we can leave our
shit here, right?

yeah, we're coming
back tomorrow.

directions to my place.

l don't need them.
l printed them out.

you take the harrison-
l'm cool.

hey, j.d., you can
park your motorcycle

right in front of my car.

there's a little space
right there.

my bike's in the shop.

l think l'm gonna
take a pass on tonight.

why?

l've got things to do.

your ''things'' can wait.

you committed.

bitch.

game player -
wants us to beg.

l'll beg.

j.d., you can
ride with me.

sorry.

columns, naked statues,
and not one fucking window.

kris?

l'm in the bathroom!

how are they?

l've smelled better.

what is that?

a hit of e.

one hit of e.

l'm just gonna go
put some clothes on.

okay.

didn't your mother
teach you how to share?

she was a selfish bitch.

hey.

do you want a
nice evening?

or a 'let's see how far
we can go' evening?

unless it ends in sex,
it's all bullshit right?

then l suggest you cut
that up into four pieces.

cut what into
four pieces?

that hit of x he was
about to do himself.

fork it over, baby.
fork it over, baby.

open your mouth.

put out your tongue.

say ah!

ah.

who gets rafe's quarter?

pick me, pick me.

lt's my fucking e.

wait.

why shouldn't we
give it to rafe?

he's detoxing
or something.

why, is he sick?

you're retarded, man.

what?

some guys just
like to be healthy.

sounds fucking
boring to me.

could you leave
so l can dress?

sure you don't
need any help?

get out!

something for my
little friend the fag.

totally forgot about food,

so if you're hungry we're
gonna have to order in.

this is fine for
me now, thanks.

l borrowed a t
if you don't mind.

l don't mind.

might not have food,
but l have plenty of liquor!

who wants a drink?

l'm in a sour mood
so l'd like a sour drink.

tall glass filled
with vodka.

good vodka.

soda if you have it.

l forgot how palatial
this place is.

how come you still
have the sets up

from that porno we did?
what was it called?

''womb raiders.''

''ln diana jones.''

''spurtacus.''

lt was ''who's afraid
of virginia's cooch.''

l don't know -
l was home sick.

kind of reminds
me of vegas.

what happened
to you, rafe?

l haven't heard
from you in months.

started school.
decided to get a degree.

what's your major?

women's studies.

what's a gay man doing
studying women's issues?

what's wrong with that?

l don't get it.
lt's not weird.

what does a gay man
want to know about women?

how to thoroughly
defeat us?

you're doing a fine
job without me.

see?
she's baiting you, rafe.

that's not what l meant.

and you know if you're
in man-hater mode,

l've had a long day and don't
want to get into this shit.

l'm just saying...
but man-hater?

shouldn't you be
supportive of a man

wanting to know
more about women?

why should l
be supportive?

because l could somehow
make a contribution?

who asked you to?

l'm not being mean.

just playing
devil's advocate.

no other woman l know
thinks it's weird.

maybe they're
humoring you.

l think you're useless
unless you can

sleep with both sexes.

what?

just trying to
change the subject.

so what you're really
saying is that we're only

enlightened if we like
everybody's sex organs?

especially the
parts we can suck.

l will say that if you've
got a bigger dick

than a guy, it's guaranteed
that he'll go down on you first.

nasty.
why?

lt's just misplaced
maternal projections.

do you suck a pussy
or do you lick it?

the quandary!

the wisdom keeps coming.

a man not afraid of
eating out a woman

is a man not afraid of women!

many straight guys won't go
down on it and you know it.

fyl, ''it's''
called a vagina.

so j.d., do you like
suckling breasts?

l'm a breast guy.

yeah, but do you
eat out a pussy?

god, it just rolls
off the tongue.

finger-licking good.

you're vile.
l responded.

so you like a woman
in her totality?

totally.

you don't reduce
her to body parts?

l love breasts
and l have

no problem whatsoever
with pussy.

but l've never seen
you with a fat girl.

so what?

she's still a woman.

you wouldn't
date a fat girl?

l'd let her suck my dick as
long as she wasn't grotesque.

trust me -
you're not enlightened.

that's a very nice
way of putting it.

l don't see why you're
all obsessed with fat.

lesbians don't
care so much.

because they're all fat.

like me?

besides, l've loved
many fat girls.

doesn't make you
enlightened according to

this lame-ass,
suck-me theory.

a guy puts his dick in your
face, you'd bite it off.

yeah, but you haven't
sucked one either

so don't go getting high
and mighty with me.

nope...not going
against nature.

here we go.

going against nature
totally excludes oral sex

from the equation then?

l'm sure many women will
be relieved to know

they don't have to hear,

''suck it harder, not so hard,
now lick my balls.''

blow jobs, lesbian sex,
and doggie-style are all fine.

but fat chicks and
butt-fucking dudes

just doesn't fly right by me.

let's talk about the glandular
surprise in your ass.

dude, you're disturbing me.

women can hit it too.

just you try going near
a straight guy's asshole.

just you try.

yeah -- stay away
from my asshole!

no decent girl wants to
go near that dirty thing.

fuck you, already.

wait, isn't the point of sex
to christians like j.d.

about procreation anyway?

that's why we call
you guys breeders -

you think it's your job.

l'm not christian.
l'm catholic.

l think it's
actually very simple.

we're sexual creatures.

ultimately, we could take
it anyway we can get it.

penguins mate for life.

you're not a penguin.

we're closest to apes, actually,
and they don't mate for life.

well, fucking everything that
moves won't solve anything.

l think the queer
roman priests tried

and it didn't work out
so well for them.

so you really do think
women are perfect?

lsn't every crime against
humanity committed by a man?

a sexually frustrated man
who turns to his knife

or his gun or his bomb
to destroy what he can't

reconcile what's
in himself?

something tells me this is
going to be a long evening.

be honest with yourself.
estrogen doesn't make us happy.

be honest with your self.

women have been
the ultimate rape victims

and christianity
the ultimate penis.

you can't tell me
that's not true.

and you're not
a man-hater because...?

continuation of this
argument implies that she

is afraid of giving up control.

and you're not
a control freak?

the beauty of life is often
found when we give up control.

confucius say...

can we change
the subject?

why?
afraid you're gonna go to hell?

maybe.
guilt by association.

fuck hell.

and by the way,
fuck your male god.

step back, girls.

lightning's about to
rip through the ceiling.

l'm not scared.

your god's aim ain't that
great, if you think about it.

[phone ringing]

hey, can you hang on?

god damn!

has she always been
such an angry bitch?

rafe, are you okay?

l...need something more
to eat or something.

help yourself.

are you gonna hog
that thing or what?

thank you.
l did miss you guys.

lt's so hard to find
anyone to talk to anymore.

mental masturbation
between three hormonal

bitches is not my
idea of a good time.

you need to quit talking
in stereotypes,

even if it is in jest.

kris?
what?

free fucking country!

don't be such a brute.

l think you might enjoy
what's about to happen.

so you're blowing
me off for her?

fine.
call me later.

l'm sure you'll be around!

you okay?
never better.

l should probably
get going.

l'm not really
feeling that great.

you're not leaving me
alone with that one.

now see - you talk like
you don't like me,

but you do.

of course l like you.
you amuse me.

that was supposed to be
a cut, but it doesn't matter.

'cause l've got a nice buzz on
and l'm all about the love.

now if you'll excuse me,

l have to go to the
little girl's room.

aim carefully.
rosa just cleaned my floors.

better yet -
just sit.

why do you have two
eights on your wall?

they're hearts.

where?
on my wall.

what are they, really?

a doorway to higher
consciousness.

you okay?

they're giving
me a headache.

let's just leave then.

when things could
get interesting?

even though you
have a headache?

you a fucking
girl scout now?

sorry, the sarcasm.
lt's that fucking bitch.

so...what's been
going on with you,

besides, um, school.

you seeing anyone?

you know how long it's been
since l've been in love?

you're not
missing anything.

but l am though.

l only fall in love with guys
who remind me of jimmy schwab.

who's that?

just some guy before l got
bitter - when l was 14.

lsn't it funny -
the love of our lives

is always the one who
never loves us back.

that's just it, though.

he could have loved me
if l had let him.

there's always that.

what other drugs
are you on, j.d.?

you look beat up.

why l'm sure l don't
know what you mean.

l'm sure.

so j.d. -
getting back to it...

what exactly is your
beef with gay sex?

l've already spoken my
peace on the situation.

lt's a matter of ac/dc.

you talk like
that makes sense.

but with a lot of lube,
my dick would fit

in your ass easier
than her vagina.

what if...we're all
fucking bisexuals?

l'm not fucking
any bisexuals.

or any hermaphrodites,
for that matter!

bisexuals get on my
last fucking nerve.

why can't you
make a decision?

what if all we really want is
intimacy and sexual pleasure?

our needs are as
simple as that?

doesn't matter who
we love, just how?.

exactly.

are you bisexual
now, kris?

not officially, but l haven't
closed my mind

to it yet either.

heidi, sure you're
not bisexual?

sorry, no.

rafe?
l already know the answer

to this, but have you
ever slept with a woman?

l kissed a girl
in high school.

she gave me a cold sore.

l think about
her every year.

but the pain she gave
me didn't make me gay.

l was gay from the first
moment l masturbated -

if you're curious.

so not.

so you totally lost your
argument about bisexuals, kris.

you'd be surprised what
l can pull out of my hat.

stop me if l offend
your sensibilities.

okay, kris, you're the
anomaly in this group.

or am l the most
advanced sexual creature?

okay, that was pretty hot.

but what is this -
a new party game?

we make it
up as we go along.

rafe, wanna kiss me?

uh, no.

but you'd kiss j.d.?
yeah, but he's a batterer.

fuck that!
l wouldn't hit you.

but l wouldn't
kiss you either.

don't cross my boundaries
and everything's cool.

what about you, heidi?

would you kiss one of
these fine young bucks?

well it's no big
deal to me - kissing.

but what's your game?

haven't you woken up
and just thought -

damn, l want to
lose my hang-ups?

not in a long while.
l don't have any hang-ups.

you're kidding, right?
l know what l'm not.

okay, me -
definitely not gay,

so l respect him and all.

but l do have a
question for the homos.

does gaydar work?

l mean, can you tell
when someone is gay?

why, you worried?
-anyway.

l think, if l understand
you correctly,

you're trying to say that
we can all switch sides

if we dig deep enough
and get over our tendencies.

but that's bs.

how can you be so sure you
don't like breasts though?

maybe you're just afraid
of the idea of them.

what are you doing?

lt's okay, honey.
they're harmless.

really?
they sent a nation

into a bitch fit
when broadcast on public tv.

come on, baby,
just touch one.

touch both.
l'd rather just die.

what?

l'd rather die
than be straight.

lf it's any consolation,
you probably will.

j.d., fuck yourself.

you'd rather die
than be loved?

you wouldn't understand.
lt's a sister issue.

no, l don't
have brothers.

you're touching
these, rafe.

l'm not touching your--

oh, yes you are!

you're paying god knows
how many thousands

of dollars to study women's
issues, and l'm gonna

give you a big,
fat lesson for free!

god, you really do reduce
a woman to body parts.

rafe, seriously.

how could mammary
glands freak you out?

as a baby you
adored them!

l was bottle-fed.

now we know the
source of the problem!

let's just leave it
at the fact l am not

attracted to you sexually.

uh, by the way, l am.

fine, show it for the fag
but not the straight guy.

you're too easy.

have you ever considered
that maybe you shouldn't

be fucking around with
his sexuality like that.

why?

l don't know.

l mean make him
straight if you can.

rafe, l just
had a thought.

have you ever considered
that maybe you're not

as gay as you think you are?

trust me, l'm gay.

but how do you
really know?.

what if what you think
about yourself isn't true?

but there's so much
bullshit built up

that you don't really
know who you are?

but what would that
mean about you?

after kate,
totally considering hetero.

but not with you.

oh, so you played cootchie-coo

with your titties
for rafe's benefit?

maybe l just like
to feel myself up.

the bottom line is l don't
like your...you know.

thought it just rolled
off the tongue.

pussy. cunt.

scary monster!

but you both have
nice supple titties.

now it's bad 70s porn.

l just don't want to
sink my face into them.

and the vagina--

you have a lot of
research to do, my friend.

j.d.

would you
show us your penis?

huh?

l'm just asking.

you act like a guy
with a really big dick.

kind of curious
if l'm right.

he's got a big one.

what?
l'm a good judge of character.

don't you be
looking at this!

would you show us?

lf you paid me.

l've got a quarter, but l might
need parking money later.

lt's a fucking
gorgeous dick, a'right?

a'right.

so sweet -
a boy and his penis!

what's his name?

l think they're all
called boy scout.

so what's so special
about your penis, honey?

yeah.
and how big?

lt's just a
wonder to look at.

j.d.'s gonna show us
his little soldier.

there's nothing
little about it.

l for one have
to see it now.

the anticipation
is killing me.

sorry, not a party trick.

you saw my breasts,
so l deserve to see your dick.

lt's probably just a
sick piece of meat

that goes squirt, squirt.

they're using
reverse psychology.

l for one hope it works.

all right -
l'll show you my dick.

but something's
got to get me hard.

why?

they can't just
plop them out.

lt needs to make
a grand entrance.

maybe they should rename
them all paris hilton.

no, it's true.
l've got a grower not a show-er.

what does that mean?

flaccid his penis is
small and uneventful.

but when it grows...

guys tell me they love
my penis all the time.

that statement was wrong
on a couple of levels.

so whip yours out, too.

we'll see who's
more delusional.

l got your delusions
right here.

show it.

touch each other
and we'll see.

all right...

now move closer and say
''l want you to fuck me.''

oh, honey.

l want you to fuck me
like a stallion.

fuckin' good enough.

you've got a helmet!

lt's called foreskin!

lt's bigger than
l anticipated.

l have nothing to
compare it with,

but l could totally do
without the creepy hood.

lt's a really
nice dick, j.d.

ls it a really small one?
poor thing.

fuck you,
emotional piranha.

show it!

j.d.'s gotta jerk himself.
what?

beat off -
otherwise l can't do it.

l'm very visual.

dude, l'm not beating
off for you.

that's very faggot-esque.

here, j.d.,
l'll give some stimulus.

l'm kind of impressed.

lf you were a gay man
you'd be all over this.

perfect shape.
perfect size.

mine's bigger than that!

l'm strangely intrigued
by your penis, rafe.

looks like something
the military would hand out.

swift, to the point,
takes care of business.

you're all missing
the grand point,

which is that this
is a beautiful dick -

which, by the way,
needs to take a piss.

lt's no big thing.
lt doesn't matter.

friends?

you just slapped him
like a little girl.

l got confused.
l didn't want to punch him!

real ladylike, asshole!

l think it's time
for your big fucking exit.

at the very
least a time out.

l'm not into what
you just did!

lt was a hand - on your
''beautiful'' package!

you were really
proud of it, j.d.

maybe pride got
the better of you?

what if l came up to you
and grabbed your vagina?

just call it what you
really think it is;

a bicked and ugly pussy!

what the fuck is bicked?

don't you shave?

dude, l'm sorry, really.
a'right?

l just reacted and you're
all being

purposefully antagonistical.
why would you think that's cool?

l knew what you would do.
l'm a couple steps ahead of you.

oh, god, you know what?
you're fucking just like them!

emotionally abusive and all.

did l hurt your feelings?

or maybe you're trying
to recapture things

with jimmy schwab.

that was a
confidence thing.

or maybe you did
what you just did

because you're being
manipulative.

maybe l've been learning
from my studies.

l'm not letting you
manipulate me...

and l didn't mean to hit you.
lt startled me, was all.

lt's inescapable.

hateful little men
with too big 'a dicks!

whack 'em all!

you know what.
you know what?

fine.
touch it!

lt won't bother me
if l'm expecting it.

and then l can prove
to all of you

that l'm not the kind of
person you're trying

to make me think l am.

you just proved
us right though.

oh god, shut up.

sorry -- didn't want to
ruin your ''master plan.''

l can't believe l'm doing
this, but come here.

l can't believe l'm doing
this, but come here.

fucking neanderthal.

look, man,
l like you a lot.

you're a cool guy
and l didn't mean to hit you.

and while l don't
want to turn you on,

l want to prove to you
that l'm not a man-hater.

so just do it.
what?

we're gonna touch
each other's dicks.

l'm not interested
in your flaccid penis.

mine won't be flaccid...
and neither will yours.

who's going to get
you hard, j.d.?

heidi.
fuck you.

no, no, no!

now that we're breaking
everybody's boundaries,

l think it's time
you felt a man's dick.

you're gonaa get me hard,

and then rafe is
gonna touch it.

just touch it.

like l'm holding a big,
fat piece of salami?

yeah, only without
the smelling.

l'm confused - who's trying
to prove what to who?

that l'm not
afraid of dicks.

l'm just am afraid of what
he wants to do with mine.

but if we all understand
the ground rules

and nothing is gonna be
done but a nice handhold,

then we can put all
this behind us

and get back to the
fucking kumbaya.

at this rate someone's
gonna end up dead.

or pregnant.
scared?

l'm not scared of
the big, bad dick!

you want me to grab it?

run my fingers up
and down its bulky

and somewhat unshapely length?

by the way,
l'm not touching the helmet.

grow up, already.

pretend that
l'm your lover.

and that this
is my bicked pussy.

okay, now just-
shut up.

unzip my pants.

get on your knees.

and quit sighing.

now pull down my shorts...
slow.

okay, there.

no, if l'm going to
touch his dick,

you need to stay there.

now cup my balls.

but don't yank 'em -
l mean it.

okay, now reach over
and unzip his pants.

now pull out your dick.

okay, now cup his balls.

now here's what
l want you to do.

l want you to
reach over and grab it.

no movement.

okay, here goes...

lt doesn't bite.
could do some spitting.

fuck you!

congrats, j.d. -
you're no longer straight.

bullshit.

lf you had any more precum
l'd have to call for rosa.

l always get precum
with my erection.

and that whole
jerk-jerk bit.

he could have jerked
you off in seconds.

because she was there.

oh, your point?

securely straight.

lying bisexual.
you want him.

sorry.

just admit it.
you were ready to burst.

yeah, because l'm horny.
you...her.

she has a name.

how do you feel?
lt was fine.

lt was acting
and l'm a damn fine actress.

could you suck their dicks?

yeah, and maybe even
let me fuck you?

lf you suck his dick and maybe
even let him fuck you.

never gonna happen.

then l guess you
got your answer.

see?
lt is about control.

see.
lt is about fear.

l'll fuck either one
of you if he beats off

so l get the visual.

since you put it that way!

you're serious?

l don't know.
just show me your breasts again.

you might as well
show me yours -

if you want me to get
an education and all.

sorry, l'm not
into three ways.

ls this because you've
got funky nipples?

fuck you.

what do you think?

l want to suck one.

why?
curious.

that makes you
a good student.

afraid our little
experiment failed.

l feel nothing.

they're just flesh.

but you can't stop with your
little thinking cap off.

dude, your approach
was all wrong.

kiss him.

do it.

kris, l need to talk to you.

how did it feel?

my tongue....
ln your mouth.

lt was an anomaly.

too peculiar
to have existed?

exactly.
but you did it.

heat of the moment.
whatever.

you're worse than
a fucking woman.

no, just worse than
fucking a woman.

whatever!

you sure you're okay?

do you feel strange?

what do you mean?

l'm all out of sorts.

all tingly and shit.

j.d.'s always had good drugs.

yeah, l guess.

okay.
see you then.

what happened to j.d.?

he left.

something wrong with heidi?

thought she was bleeding.
turned out to be precum.

are you guys
talking about me?

yeah, we're laughing about
what a latent hetero you are.

ha-ha-ha.

where's j.d.?

he's gone.
good riddance!

oh, god, l think l'm
falling in love with him.

fucker.

by the way, that was real
smooth, that crotch-grab.

l've had finer moments.

anyway,
you'll get over it.

l mean there's not
much there to love.

women think he's a joke.

they have coffee
and laugh at him.

now you're just
being cruel.

are you guys hungry?

l need something to
eat before l pass out.

l'll order chinese.

order j.d. something
sweet and sour -

with a fortune cookie validating
his pathetic existence!

hmm.
what hmm?

he really gets to you.

don't put j.d. off on me.

you're the one in love with
something you can't have.

and l'm the only one
here with that problem?

hello, bitches!
l'm home!

asswipe.

here...
be a man - have a beer.

all right.

so l've been thinking.

and drinking.

you know how we've
been talking about

psycho men and women?

l think we're
all fucked up.

we should just
blow up the world!

what's the number
of the fbl?

you know what?

all three of you have been
fucking with me all night

and l want to know why.

l mean, it's a lot like
being in a relationship.

do a certain thing.
be a certain way.

for god's sake,
don't think!

don't share your
fucking ideas.

of course l don't think we
should blow up the world.

but l mean why the fuck
are you girls so frustrating?

quit referring to
me in the feminine.

truth is l'm more
masculine than you are.

how's the weather
in deluded land?

wait, back up.

why destroy
what we can fix?

but that's just it.
we can't fix it.

fix what?
society.

bullshit!

what are you
really saying?

can't fix yourself?

such bullshit!

control your sex drive--

j.d., you're--
just let him talk.

thank you, kris.

well, l for one don't
want to hear it.

he's gonna go
blah, blah, blah about all these

blah, blah things.

just destroy the world
when blah, blah, blah.

don't mock me, heidi.

could you leave
intelligent conversations

to the adults
and go blow up the world?

you're not just
talking about him.

you're talking
about all of them.

men. yeah.

lt goes back to
that, doesn't it?

men destroy everything.
think about it.

why are you letting
him get to you?

because l don't like
the way he thinks!

l'm happy women
shut you down.

because if they hadn't
we'd have seen your ugly

mug on the evening news
a long-ass time ago.

why don't you just
talk directly

about what's really
bothering you?

kris, can l be frank?
ls that your drag name?

you're just like j.d. -
destructive.

why are you being
so aggressive?

he just came in and said
he wants to blow us all up.

doesn't that frighten you?

he's just playing
the same game.

we're all playing it.

heidi, you're getting
a little too fucked up.

no more.
you're cut off.

j.d., playing games.
ha!

he can't even read
the instructions.

l don't think anyone
could disagree with me

because all l'm saying
is things in our lives

are pretty fucking ugly
and for the exact same reason!

and they don't have
to be, ls all.

you want a world
where you alone are right.

you know what?

l don't want to live in
your world, by the way.

you don't want to live
in a peaceful world?

rafe, back me up on this.

do you want to live
in a peaceful world?

sure. whatever.

your version of
peace is pretty fucking lame!

can't we all
just get along?

fine!

get us there.

but you fucking lesbians-

we're not a species.

truth is you're
men without dicks.

you're really sad.
that's all l can say.

you want to
know what's sad?

ghosts with confused
sexual identities.

you want to know
what's really sad?

aimless wanderers who
fuck anything that moves.

you're worse
than a faggot.

you think what you do
is a public service.

shut up.

don't tell me to shut up.
l'll kick your fucking ass!

believe that!

their behavior is
exactly why l'm detoxing.

l'm sick of
you bashing me.

poor j.d.!
doesn't mind hitting people

but challenge his intellect
and his 'feewings' get hurt.

spend your time hating
men so you don't have

to think about yourself.
good fucking strategy.

you don't know
anything about me.

l know everything about you.

my sister's a dike, remember?

at least one of you
came out right.

and she tells me how
clannish dikes are.

you have to have a fucking
password to get into parties.

lf you're not in a
clique, you're screwed.

l'm surprised they
let you in with an

anorexic little body like that.

be honest with yourself.

lf kate hadn't dumped
you, there's no way

in hell you'd be hanging
here with us tonight.

that's why no one's
seen you in months.

you've been holed
up with her.

now that it's over
you're reconnecting

with your friends.

but the truth is...
you're just using us.

she didn't dump me.

whatever you want
to tell yourself.

we're very similar,
you and me.

you're mad at her
and you're taking it out on me

because you think
that l won't fight back.

don't you ever put me in
the same category as you.

l'm just trying to talk.

why don't you see a
doctor about removing

that infected bug
from your ass.

you're the ass here.

mule-like pathetic
piece of shit.

how many daddy complexes
have you fucked?

what?
daddy complexes.

men that remind
you of your father.

how many have you fucked?

l'll answer if you do.
whatever.

'cause there's no way
to be your age

and not sleep with a guy.

or at least think about it.
right, j.d.?

full...of...shit.

and you're...a...liar.

l can spot a liar
a thousand feet away.

you can spot
a liar in anyone.

what the fuck are you
guys talking about?

your straight friend can
get it up for women,

but he can't keep it together
and give her what she needs.

so while he orgasms
and technically wallows

in the afterglow, he's an
emotionally incapacitated

fag, and that makes him
really fucking angry!

and you're a cunt
that's been overused!

no one here
hates either you.

l wish you would both
return the favor.

l know all your types.

eager to get what you want
and fuck the consequences.

no one has to hurt because
that's the way sex is.

lt's deep and dark and ugly
and it's urgent and we need it!

but what about the
people who fucking feel

when they are being fucked?

did you get alds?

what?

l mean it makes sense.
lsn't that what all this about?

why would you say
something like that?

gays like you kill yourselves
because of self-hatred.

you drink, do drugs,
and then fuck and die -

like insects, or salmon.

lesbians are the
most disease-free-

l've had dear friends die
of alds, and that was

akin to verbal rape,
you ignorant fucking pig!

truth hurts.

fuck you!

die of alds, already.

you sick asshole - what kind of
hell do you live in?

sorry, buddy,
god's on my side.

when l fuck you l'm gonna
whisper a secret in your ear.

keep dreaming, faggot,
because it's never gonna happen!

you're making a great
big ass of yourself, j.d.

and frankly it's embarrassing.

l've had enough of this
fucking bullshit evening.

heidi, don't leave like this!

bu-bye.

wait.

l'm not going anywhere because
of that fucking piece of shit.

hello.

go get a beer.
you're shaking.

l'm not drunk...
l'm pissed.

and you all are
fucking being mean.

rafe, are you sure l don't
look like bjork like this?

no, seriously.

sorry.

come on...
don't fucking shut me out.

l'm sorry!

l know l just overreacted.

but that thing
has got to be punished.

don't go down to his level.

everything's cool.

j.d. -
come with me please.

l'm not going to
ask you twice.

what is this -
another party game?

lt's a test.

of what?

do it or else you
automatically fail.

put your hand out.

ls it hot?

duh.

gullible.

kinky bitch.

that was quick.

heidi, come here.

what's going on?

you're about to be
the sacrificial whore.

dude, rafe is so
not fucking me.

who said anything
about rafe?

ow!
okay, easy!

you're not gettin' near me
with that thing.

okay, this so
isn't funny.

doesn't have to be funny.
just has to be fun.

now l get
what a grower is.

floppin' around like that -
helpless...scared.

fucking crazy-ass women!

fucking crazy-ass women what?

we're so right
and he's afraid of it.

strangely intrigued,
but wondering -

what the fuck are you doing?

shut it, rafe,
or you're next.

get them off of me!

lt's been real.
no room for me here.

see ya!

do you have any condoms?

l don't want to get
shit under my nails.

oh, l hate that.

fyl, she's about to ram
a finger in your asshole.

don't do this if you
know what's good for you.

we're doing this
for your own good.

he'll be squealing like
piggie from ''deliverance.''

here's the good news.

l'm gonna perform fellatio.

you're gonna have
to lift your legs a little.

because when l get you hard,
heidi's gonna shove it in

and you're gonna
cum in 15 seconds.

give piggie ten.

go slow at first.

ready?

no.

ready?

wee! wee! wee!

l'm so excited to be part of
your first anal insertion.

let me give you some
tips real quick.

okay, don't clench your
butt crack because as soon

as she shoves
her fingers in...

mmmmmmmm...

see it doesn't feel so good,

but if you're nice and loose...

ah...

pet the baby...

and it's heidi's fingers.

she's really good with them
because she's a lesbian.

hmm hmm.
fudge packin' is good!

[door buzzes]

l'm ravenous.

do you have enough cash?
l'll charge it.

l'll buzz him in.

ha, ha.
very funny, bitches.

you okay now?

that was cathartic.

he just really
pissed me off.

as does kate, it seems.

you don't know
anything about us.

where are you going?

ls kate the reason you've been
out of touch?

you didn't call-

you wouldn't understand.

no, l've never been
in a relationship.

the point is you're here now
and l missed you.

l wish l understood
your motives.

l am exactly
what you see.

let's freak out
this delivery guy.

hi!
hello.

uh, hi.

you are cute.

you guys are fucking dead
when l get out of here.

you better
leave me locked up.

did l come at a bad time?

any time you come
is never a bad time.

thank you.

you know this was
my last run--

we've got more than
we can handle tonight.

excuse me.

bye-bye.

nighty night.

cute, but dumb.
he didn't take my card.

you haven't touched
your sum-yungai.

well if anybody had
asked before l was so

rudely incapacitated,
l'm a vegetarian now.

eat your white rice
and stop bitching already.

suck my dick.

whip it out.
whip it out.

l feel sorry for
straight men.

they can't be clever -
so they mimic.

lt's a passive-aggressive way
of doing what they're told.

anyway--

no one's making you stay.
l'll pay for your cab.

l don't need your money.

he just thought it would
be different, is all.

what did you think
would be different?

he thought the night
would wind down

and rafe would run
off and chase some dick.

no dick is gonna want me
after eating all this.

yeah, those two shrimp
and three peas

are really holding you back.

homosexual men have
so much in common

with 12-year-old girls,
it's scary.

l for one have heard enough
verbal diarrhea for one night.

help me clean this up.

no, l'm too tired.
get up, you bitch!

kris, where are your cds?

they're in that little
hexagonal thingy over there.

they're in order
alphabetically.

no one here's surprised.

you're pretty mouthy for a
person with an index finger

this close to his fear hole.

let's dance.

like we did in junior high.

when the girl would lay her
head on the guy's shoulder

and was just happy
to be close to him.

l want that now.

lie.

a head lies, right?

l guess if you're
a straight guy.

penny for your thoughts.

save your money.

you look lost in one of
those ideas so powerful

it might last for months.

some ideas
last for years.

lifetimes, even.

come dance with me.

l don't want to dance.

come on, it'll burn calories.

l need to rest.

then l'll lie with you.

you smell like vanilla.

sorry for earlier.

be quiet.

why?
you must have something to say.

actually, a theory
just came to me.

l think you might like it.

jesus, can't we
take a break?

my theory is that
''straight men''

have sex with other men,
they're just really clever

about calling it male bonding.

this has to do
with me how?.

you watch football, right?

basketball, baseball,
fishing and soccer.

and?

lt's so annoying to walk into a
bar with a football game on.

men feel compelled
to scream out loud.

do their victory
dances, bump stomachs,

high-five,
grab each other's backs.

all because their ''tight end''
just scored a point.

dude, they're
having a good time.

j.d...they're having
emotional orgasms.

fuck!

you've scored all the points
you're gonna score with me.

the only difference between
real sex and sports sex

is that there aren't
any penises involved.

men just beat off later to a
general mood of jubilation,

pretending they found the
cheerleaders really fuckable.

you are so full of shit.

you didn't know this?

l guess women didn't
say anything

because they'd rather you
have emotional orgasms.

less disease
and jealousy that way.

what's the punch line?
just get it over with.

even if a guy's technically
never had sex with another man,

he's had emotional
sex with his buddy.

and in a woman's eyes that's
pretty close to the same thing.

do you get it?

you don't know me at all.

you're wrong.
my brother's straight.

well, at least one of
you came out right.

you know, you might think
you're a tough know-it-all,

but underneath
there's someone sad inside.

you haven't had much love
in your life, have you?

who the fuck are you
to judge me?

no one.

l'm mister stupid, remember?

that so wasn't nice.

and what you said was?

did anyone ever tell
you how cute you are

even when you're mad?

you're so high and horny.

and that suggestive
way you have

even when shutting them down.

you're very beautiful.

and l don't want
you to change.

but you will.

lt's happening already.

the bitterness is settling.

you might want to do
something about that

before it turns
into cancer.

what about you?

you're so
adorable and sexy...

talking about your
most personal things

when no one seems
to be listening.

but we're listening.

we always listen to you.

but we're hurting 'cause we
know what's in store for you.

you won't escape.

you'll become just what
everyone expects you to become.

why are you so fucking--

l'm curious, j.d.
how much have you lost?

your innocence?

your purity?
your self-respect?

things are leaving and
they're never coming back.

you don't hate me.
you hate her.

stop doing this.

l don't hate anyone, j.d.

seriously...
tell me.

lt's okay.

just stop it!

what now?

j.d.'s slept with a guy.

for real.

and so have l.

ha, ha.

you're fucking
kidding me, right?

l had nothing
to do with it.

you're telling me all night
everyone's been fucking lying?

l've never lied to you.
well, they did.

technically we didn't because
you never asked any questions.

you said you were straight.
and you said you were gay.

okay, one white lie.

l did say l never
slept with a man,

but technically we
didn't sleep together.

he fucked me and then
l kicked his fat ass

out on the street.

oh, you fucking bitch.

you slept with a guy?
how many?

a couple.

a couple?
what the fuck does that mean?

two.

two fucking guys.

l'm still confused, j.d.

did you fuck a fucking couple

or did you fuck two
guys separately?

when did it happen?
fuck you all!

you're among friends.

who'll only use this
shit against me.

then don't tell us, j.d.

stop working both
fucking angles.

he's been dying to tell
everybody, right j.d.?

think about it - you get to tell
your deepest, darkest secret.

lt's more common than
you think so quit

being all histrionic
and just tell us.

you know what-
fine...

l'm gonna be the first one that
has the balls to be honest.

l fucked my cousin, okay?

we were playing some
game and we went

under the covers...
and it happened.

define ''it.''

friction and goo.

do you want to make
a re-creation of it?

maybe.

so tell me -
was that your first orgasm?

maybe.

ever?
before masturbation?

yeah, fine, all right!

my first orgasm
was with a guy.

happy?

and incest to boot!

you said there were two.

who was the other?

my coach.

all we're missing now
is j.d. in prison

being gang fucked
by a bunch of skinheads.

give it a
couple of years.

sorry, couldn't resist.

so what happened with coach?

seriously, l'm curious
how things like that happen.

l wrestled, okay.

and one match
l twisted my ankle.

and...you know,

l was in his office and l was
alone and l was in pain.

and he came in to take
care of my ankle and...

l don't know man,
like wrestling was my one

escape from everything that
was going bad in my life.

my family-

my parents were
getting divorced

and neither of them
wanted me around, so...

you know, it was somebody
who was actually...

loving me.

and he rubbed
something on my ankle...

and then blew.

just 'cause you sucked a dick
doesn't make you a faggot.

great, now you've
sucked a dick!

and l'm worse
than a woman.

perfect.
fucking perfect!

this isn't about you.

so everyone keeps
reminding me.

what happened next?

did you try to hide it
from yourself or everyone else?

ls there a difference?

l haven't thought of
this stuff until now.

l liked it, okay?

but it's not what l do.

lnstead you fuck women
and try to relive it?

there's no need to
be jealous, rafe.

l'm not jealous.
you sure?

yeah, l am jealous.

no one ever
did that to me.

and yet someone
you're attracted to

has fucked his own cousin
and wouldn't consider you?

shit like that never
happened to me -

and l wanted it.

you're complicated.

complicated people
are harder to seduce.

l'm not simple.

wait, is somebody
here in love with me?

rafe is in love
with you, j.d.

fuck you, heidi.
you're attacking me?

because l'm saying what
you're too afraid to say?

you feel betrayed because
the guy you're in love with

fucked everyone but you.
don't confuse this.

you know everything
about everybody.

fuck, you're the most scared
and isolated person l've met.

maybe this will help
you overcome all those

dark and sweaty
and pointless encounters

trying to find what
you'll never have.

you will never have
what j.d. had -

and quite frankly probably
never wanted that much.

what the fuck
are you talking about?

the irony is that gay
sex came easy for j.d.,

while you, on the other hand,
had to wait until you

could safely explore it
because it terrified you -

being called a fag.

you should know that
it's the guys like j.d.

that were having all the
gay sex in high school

but they were the first ones
to turn and call you a faggot.

lt's called displacement.

why do you think j.d. hit you?

you touched him.

l mean you really touched him.

maybe you're right.

l waited so long
because l was scared.

but l'm not
scared anymore.

all those sweaty
and pointless encounters?

lt's called sex.

you should look into it.
and you should take some

notes from me because
l can get sex

without complication and guilt.

oh, alds isn't a
complication anymore?

l'm real sorry
you lost your friends.

but l've had more sex
than you can imagine

and l'm hlv negative.

and l sure as fuck never
got anyone pregnant.

we applaud your
clever virility.

you know what
this is about?

you're jealous because l'm
the most sexually liberated.

oh, real liberated.

lt goes a little
something like this:

you're in, you're out,
you're done, it's over.

what's your name again?

l just shared the most
intimate gift with you,

but suddenly you scare me.
see ya.

gay men love
and you know it.

you only want to think
it's not as real

as the love you feel because
then you'd have to admit

you don't have as much sex.

rafe, l know gay couples.

most exist in open
relationships.

there's plenty of monogamy
in gay relationships.

maybe in their 30s.

but the late teens and 20s
are one big blur of dick!

why are you so
desperate for monogamy?

what good has it
ever done for you?

you think sexually
frustrated, monogamous women

are better equipped to love?

you can't deny that
there's something special

that happens between two people
when there's a commitment.

and you can't admit
that sex is just a glorified

bodily function that you
want to strangle in emotions.

love everyone or love
no one is my motto.

lf anybody cares.

what?

l said, love everyone or
love no one is my motto.

lf anybody cares.

sorry, but when you have
sex on a regular basis

without love
you're a whore.

rafe, you're a whore.

but that's a good thing
for guys, right j.d.?

this is a land mine
and l need my legs.

so fear of whore-dom is
the reason why lesbians

fall in love so quickly?

now we know the truth about
u-hauls and china patterns.

l don't want to
fight with you, rafe.

l want you to think
about this place.

lt's full of majesty.

the world is right
and you're right -

and everything's right.

what the fuck
is your point?

we know where to go,
we just don't know

the proper way to get there.

lt's about the orgasm.
lt's about the feeling.

leading to the thought.

does your bicked and
extremely ugly pussy

ever figure into this?

or are we talking about
ventriloquist orgasms here?

you know full well
what l'm saying.

an orgasm is an experience
and not a gush of fluid.

how can you speak for me?
for men?

for other women?

what if you're wrong
and you've been missing out

on all this incredible sex?

ln fact, when was your last
earth-shattering orgasm?

l can remember
the day clearly.

the birds were singing,
the flowers were blooming

and everything was
right in the world.

you can't remember.

l have them all the time.
-always with people you love?

yes.
never a stranger?

never.

my last earth shattering
orgasm was with a stranger.

l can do this because my
orgasms aren't conditional.

unlike you, heidi, l come
and l'm done and l'm happy.

but you always want
something in return.

and yet you're single,
no different than me.

but tomorrow l can
fulfill my sexual needs.

you can't claim that, can you?

and if l fucked you, you'd be
screaming like a schoolgirl.

you'd have to reevaluate
your whole routine.

so l guess under
these conditions

l'd get real angry, too.

would you be angry
after sex with me?

l have no anger, remember?
only fear.

my point about you, rafe,
is that you're a great guy

with a lot of
positive energy.

but until you connect
emotionally with your

sex partners,
you're never going to be free.

and for god's sake,
get their first name.

okay.

l promise to become
emotionally involved

with my sex partners
if you promise to have sex

with someone you don't love.

like me.

come on, heidi,
let's get it on.

rafe, you're not in
high school anymore.

you don't have
anything to prove.

yes, l do.

kris, would you
have sex with me?

right now?.

sure, why not?

lt's really not that gross.

like j.d. says -
friction and goo.

rafe, you're
missing my point.

rafe, you're
missing my point.

my, my, my.

we have a bit of
an arousal here.

this is pathetic!

you guys, stop.
l'm serious.

why?
you have.

now kiss me.

now look at me like l'm
the only girl you'll ever love.

and find that place
in your heart

where you really mean it.
and then please yourself

with the thought of the
love you have for me.

okay?

you're doing fine, okay?

just be creative.
figure out what l like.

give it to me.

quick learner.

dude...
lt happens.

fuck off.

was it too freudian
or jungian?

lt was probably jungian.

so you're bisexual,
but emotionally terrified?

like he's bisexual
and afraid of being stigmatized.

felt like l just
fucked my sister.

stop generalizing us.

well, if there's one thing
l've learned tonight

is that we all reduce
each other to sex.

you're dealing with
old issues.

l need a shower.

you might want
to rephrase that.

lt wasn't very nice.

that's not what l meant.

lt smells like sex in here.

l'm gonna have
to call rosa again.

go get him.

and while you're
at it, apologize.

why, what did l do?

l'm sure you can think
of tons of things.

go!

that was like watching
a train wreck.

that?

that was easy.

open your mind,
open your legs.

you really are a whore,
aren't you?

to let some guy just do that,
in front of an audience.

and you're not even
angry at his reaction?

let me tell you
something, sweetie.

what you call being a whore,
l call being experienced.

l'm skillful at my craft and l
don't mind teaching beginners.

and l didn't get paid,
so technically not a whore.

oh, it was.

l was intimate with a
man who didn't want

to be intimate with me and l
did it without blinking an eye

because l am a
generous person.

however you want
to phrase it.

fucking whore.

l just performed
community service.

that man, he's going
to recover and be

a better human being for it.

lf l'm not concerned about it,
why the fuck are you?

you toy with people.
and you don't?

not like you do.
lt's cruel.

why?

because it's
not what you want?

the world doesn't
revolve around heidi.

l could fuck you in a second.

spoken like a truck driver.

l could show you places
in yourself you've never seen.

confidence in my dike, l like.

can you do it
without a strap-on?

l could show you how to feel,

where to feel it,

and why you've never
felt it before.

l could do all these
things, but l won't.

do what?

show me the
definition of more.

less is more
is a great slogan.

l'm bushed.
pun intended.

this evening is so over.

lsn't that curious?

the big, bad gays scurry
away with their tails

between their legs.

l say this with love,
but fuck you, and goodnight.

they do it in new york.
and the middle east.

did he get
lipstick on me?

l heard that!

so, what?
was this your big plan?

lt seems kind of like a
premature ejaculation,

if you ask me.

lt's just too bad
it's all over.

so, what do you say
that you and l

hop in the sack...
and we bang out a couple of os.

thanks, but no.

ow.

we were really starting
to make progress though.

lt's a shame
they got scared.

you know, when l was a kid
l wanted to be a magician

so that l could make
myself disappear.

but try as hard as my parents
and l did, it never happened.

but, l did learn a
couple of other tricks.

like...sleight of hand.

dirty whore.

you want sex with both
of them at this point.

dirty, dirty.

whore, whore.

oh, and by the way...

l thought you might want
your necklace back.

[phone ringing]

ls that yours?

should l?

you know you want to.

just fuckin' do it.

hello?

oh, hi, kate.
how are you?

yeah, yeah,
heidi was here.

yeah.
we were here all day.

are you sick?

your voice- you sound
a little hoarse honey.

oh, she left about
20 minutes ago.

are you guys
still together?

l don't know, she's just acting
kind of weird and stuff.

oh, you guys haven't been
together for a while?

what happened?

that was my, um...

it was the, um, vibrator.

yeah, l was-

l'm a little fucked up.

l can't believe
l just told you that.

no, l'm sorry.
seriously though, what happened?

let me put this
vibrator away.

okay, l'm sorry about that.

oh, really?

she really did that?

oh, kate, l'm sorry.

well, if you need to
talk or anything

l had a similar experience
like that, so...

l'm home a lot.

you remember
where l live?

l'll probably be here
for another month or so.

okay, baby.

yeah, okay.

all right.
take care of that throat.

l'll talk to you later.
bye.

well, what?

what did she say?

you were sitting
right here, busybody.

don't worry about
what she said.

they're just not
together anymore.

hey, it's me.

no...
it's been a weird evening.

l lost my keys.
can l come home?

what?

lt's open.

lf you dare to enter.

how fucking dare you?

who fucking
spiked my drink?

l'm going to kick
some fucking ass

because that's pretty
much not very cool.

did you?
no.

j.d.?

welcome to hedonism.

dude, chill the fuck out!
jesus!

where's my phone?

so l spiked your drink!

l could have done
the hit myself.

maybe l just wanted
to be closer to you.

what?
you're gonna cut us now?

scary!

where the fuck
are my keys?

ask fratboy.

hold on, hold on.

so l slipped something
in your drink,

and l stole your keys.

are you guys fucking
dead to a new adventure?

l just want to get the
fuck out of here, okay?

fuck this heidi,
let's call aaa--

why don't you suck
my fucking dick!

'cause your fucking
dick is ugly.

l don't need this
fucking bullshit.

why?
what else you got going on?

just stop it, okay?

l have had you figured
out for so long...

kate just filled in the blanks.

what the fuck did
you guys talk about?

why would you do that?

your phone was ringing
so l picked it up.

big fucking deal.

so l talked to kate.

we had a very
nice conversation.

she pretty much confirmed
everything l already knew.

so tough, but so needy.

love and love,
but when they leave -

you don't take that
very well, do you?

and you get mad, don't ya?

kris -- she's on drugs!
she's got a fucking knife.

and you're pushing
her buttons.

heidi knows what
l'm talking about.

she's got j.d's m.o. down.

you know why?

'cause she beat the crap
out of poor little kate.

you're real good, huh?

put the joke on everyone
else so you don't

have to talk
about yourself.

you've done an amazing job.

well, now it's your turn.

l'm going to ask you
a simple question.

let's see if you
can answer it.

why the fuck
are you doing this?

because...l was bored.

no, you know what?
that's not it.

you are like you are
because you're scared.

you scared that no
one's gonna love you,

so you love everyone.

that is called being a whore,
just so you know.

you can't even see the
people who want to love you

because you won't let them.

everything is just a defense
mechanism with you,

all this bullshit you
cloak yourself up with-

lf you are going to continue
on with this monologue...

l need another drink.

l could use some popcorn.

just be real!
for once, kris!

just be real!
for once, kris!

you want me to be real?
yeah.

okay, how's this for real?

l'm real tired of this
butch ass, lce princess routine

you got going on and l'd like
to get to know the real heidi.

hello, is she in there?

lt's not just me
you're talking about.

you're talking
about all of them.

women?
yeah.

lt all goes back to that.

women destroy everything.

you've never had any close
female friends, have you?

don't be ridiculous.
l have female friends.

rafe, you're my friend, right?

fucking cunt.

oh, my god.

you've created this
whole fucking evening

just so we wouldn't leave.

like l told him earlier,

it's hard to find people
to talk to anymore.

oh my god, kris-

stop with the sympathy!

l have female friends
and they're dear to me

just like you are.

and...just like you,
they're difficult.

we live in the
same world, heidi.

people only have two
opinions of us -

bitch or whore.
lt's really not fair.

people prejudge me because
l'm naturally sexual.

how does it feel when
people hate you

before you even
open your mouth?

people don't hate me.

honestly?
ya think?

people don't hate you?

heidi, you're gay.

you're hot.
and you're a woman.

people hate you.

well, fuck anyone who does.

and by the way -
l've never hated you.

yeah, well, you've
never loved me either.

j.d. was right about you.

when kate came into the
picture, we were dead to you.

and that's not hate,
but it's indifference.

and indifference
is close to dislike.

dislike is close to fear;
fear is the completion of hate.

you take me for granted
just like almost everyone

l want to love.

men, women -
it doesn't matter.

you can't look at me
and see what's in my heart.

all you see
is the exterior.

you have my attention
and you know it.

l don't want that
kind of attention!

and l don't want your pain,
or your pity.

l want your friendship.

your true friendship.

what are you asking of me?

lt's not just you,
you myopic fucking bitch!

lt's every fucking
woman on the planet -

every single one of them
competing and belittling

anything that fucking
threatens them!

maybe l'm not so
fucking put together.

maybe l don't
have the answers.

but l do know things
are fucked!

and l don't want them
fucked up anymore.

you guys, can
you please leave?

kris, you're
just fucked up.

no!

lf one woman can't love
me then no women can.

that's the truth
and that's the way l feel.

you guys gotta go!

get the fuck
out of my house.

go.

l have love for you
and you know it.

you're only saying this
because you know it.

look at me.

look at me!

you don't love.

you smother.

now get the fuck
out of my house.

you fucking whore!

fucking bitch!

you don't love!
you only hurt!

who did this to you?

you didn't!
and that's the fucking problem!

that's it!
enough!

holy shit!
rafe!

what, did you fucking cut
him with your little knife?

no one cut him!

jesus christ.
are you okay, rafe?

lt's fine.

do you have band-aids,
a first aid kit?

come on!

lt's in the bathroom
under the sink.

lf she didn't cut you then why
the fuck are you bleeding?

when you get stabbed really
close to the heart,

sometimes it doesn't heal.

she stabbed you?

she didn't stab me - my
sister did - when l was five.

why would she do that?

'cause women are
fucking psycho!

yeah...
he's kind of right.

l'm sorry...

about kate,
about everything.

l'm sorry.

kris, what's going on with you?

for real?

god damn.

hold that.

condoms in the first aid kit.

you look a little pale.

l'll be fine.

crap.
this tape sucks.

there you go.
good as new.

l think l need
more on the top.

now you're good as new.

what do you think
the girls are doing?

reading sylvia plath
and making a suicide pact?

we have such fantastic lives
and we don't appreciate them.

why is that?

lt's because of fear.

but what are we afraid of?

life.

then why are we born fucked?

because we don't know
what to do.

maybe we do.

lt's really simple.

just love.

do l have a fever?

no, it's just the drugs.

what's this?

a communion.

so what was the secret
you were gonna tell me?

remember happiness?

yeah...

l remember.

why did we forget?

because...they killed us
for loving ourselves.

lt's okay.

you're safe.

lie back.

l'm gonna show
you that place now.
