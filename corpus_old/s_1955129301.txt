<i>[Male voice]</i>
<i>Your home is far less likely--</i>

<i>Everybody comes</i>

OnIy you can give.
So, what is your caIIing?

I definiteIy know
what mine is.

This show is about heIping
aII of you who are watching us.

Think about and then figure out,
'cause that's your reaI job,

to figure out what is your caIIing,
and then begin to honor it.

Hundreds of peopIe

I'm going to have
to check on her.

[taIking

Um, I-I shouId, uh,
head out.

I'm-- It was nice

AIice.
AIice.

Take care, AIice.

Who was that?
I don't know.

She asked
if there was a rape

<i>(Oprah)</i>
<i>lf maybe, well, one</i>
<i>that's just for you.</i>

<i>Just a phone call,</i>

That's my-- That's my friend!

Oh, my God.

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>l'd like to read</i>
<i>from a prepared statement.</i>

<i>l was a summer baby,</i>
<i>born in the year 1 971</i>
<i>in Simi Valley, California.</i>

<i>My mother</i>
<i>was a nutritionist</i>

<i>and my father</i>
<i>was a commercial baker.</i>

<i>l've been using masturbation</i>

They cut me off.

<i>[phone ringing]</i>

HeIIo?

Hi, Ted.

AIice, it's Ted.

He saw you on the news.

<i>They cut me off.</i>
Yeah, she's mad
they cut her speech off.

<i>(Ted)</i>
<i>She sounds bad.</i>

She's about a 7.5
and cIimbing.

<i>(Ted)</i>
<i>You don't have to stay.</i>
Somebody has to stay.

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>They cut me off.</i>
Later, tater.

<i>[Alice groaning]</i>
AIice?

<i>[things breaking]</i>

<i>[water running]</i>

You hungry?

<i>l'm going to take</i>
<i>an iodine bath.</i>

It's my new thing.

I'm managing my moods
by Iiving a high protein IifestyIe.

What's going on
with the AbiIify?

I have
a prepared statement.

Okay.

''Dear DaryI, it's been
a good run, DaryI,

''but as I wiII no Ionger
be coIIecting disabiIity
from the State of CaIifornia,

''our visits
are no Ionger mandatory.

<i>''l appreciate everything</i>
<i>you have done for me,</i>

''but as a new member
of the rich and famous,

I simpIy don't have
the time for the pain.''

WeII, I have something
I'd Iike to read, too.

''My dear AIice,
I wouId be happy to discuss
the IogisticaI detaiIs

''of our new reIationship,
a reIationship which gives me
great pride

<i>''when l reflect on the ground</i>
<i>that we have covered.</i>

''Since the psycho-pharmacoIogicaI
vaIue of string cheese

''in the treatment
of borderIine personaIity disorder

<i>''is not, to my knowledge,</i>
<i>even in clinical trials,</i>

''I wouId encourage you
to reconsider waIking away

<i>Why did you stop</i>
<i>your medication?</i>

It's a new era.

Eighty-six
miIIion-doIIar AIice.

Hm.

Do you reaIIy want
to stop seeing me?

No.

Yes.

No.

What do you want
to do, AIice?

Something reaIIy big.

I'm moving today.

<i>Oh. Nice.</i>

Good.

If I paid you,

wouId you give me
a cIean-biII heaIth, mentaIIy?

<i>[girls cheering]</i>

<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Thanks for choosing</i>

So, how Iong

IndefiniteIy.

Do you aIIow

WeII, I'm sure we can work
something out.

<i>Do you have a dog?</i>
No.


What's the matter,
sweetie?

<i>[Woman on TV]</i>
<i>Located at the beautiful</i>
<i>Palm Springs area.</i>

Nothing.

Woohoo!

<i>[Alice's mom]</i>
<i>What l'm suggesting,</i>



<i>is a more</i>
<i>of a less idea.</i>

A five-doIIar tip for you.

Just ask Ted
for a IittIe advice,
smaII amount,

about what to do
with your money.

I don't need
any heIp, Mommy.

No hand?

Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

Ouch. Ooh.

Sorry, Mom.
It's aII right.

Oh. Teddy.

WeIcome to my new home.

Oh. This must be
your AIice.

This is Derick.
Hi, it's so nice
to fina--

Oh, okay.

This is, um, this is
my best friend, Gina.

I'm her Gina.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

Mwah.

Those two sour pussies
over there are my parents.
Hi.

This is Derick,
Ted's maIe Iover.
Isn't that good?

Hi, hi.
Hi.

If it weren't for you,
I don't know what
we wouId do.

I aIways knew
about Ted.
What?

When we were married.
By the way he fucked me.

Oh.

<i>(Derick)</i>
<i>l got it.</i>

So,

how does it feeI
to be a miIIionaire?

I have
a prepared statement.

Prepared statement.
Prepared statement.

Okay.

Here's what
I want to say.

Cause.
Okay?

Effect.
Okay?

<i>''l want each of you</i>
<i>to understand that</i>

''you can have
what I have right now
if you reaIIy beIieve it.

You too can have
a new Iife.''

<i>[All]</i>
<i>New life.</i>
Shh.

<i>[Alice's mom]</i>
<i>New life.</i>

''And as I begin
my new Iife,

I must refIect on the Iove
and inspiration each of you
has given me.''

<i>l love you, guys.</i>
<i>Shit, l didn't want</i>
<i>to cry until the end.</i>

A toast to AIice
and her new Iife.

New Iife.
New Iife.

To my new Iife.

<i>[Alice's dad]</i>
<i>Let's hope.</i>

I'm going
to get shrimp.

<i>lt's harvested in Ecuador,</i>

<i>where the locals</i>
<i>call it La madre</i>

<i>or The Mother.</i>

<i>Smoothies are such</i>
<i>a great way to load up</i>
<i>on powerful nutrition.</i>

<i>Every single particle</i>

<i>rewrite your DNA.</i>

<i>So, who's ready</i>
<i>for a new life?</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>[Announcer]</i>
<i>This has been</i>

<i>[bell ringing]</i>

<i>[Announcer]</i>
<i>Live for Palm Desert, California,</i>

<i>welcome to Live Alchemy.</i>

<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>You can't put yogurt</i>
<i>in waste baskets.</i>

<i>l know, but then,</i>
<i>you can't just let it be there.</i>

<i>lt's disgusting.</i>

Good to see you.
WeIcome to Live Alchemy.
I'm Gabe Ruskin.

Now, what if I were
to teII you one teaspoon
of Live AIchemy

<i>contains more usable protein</i>
<i>than a 1 6-ounce sirloin steak.</i>

WeII, get ready to pan
to the audience.

...that in 1 00 years,
our main source of food
wouId be aIgae?

Now.

I wouId beIieve it.

Ooh.
Hey, hey, wow.
We got a Iive one.


And I wouIdn't Iie to you.

Now, we're aII used
to heaIthy food tasting
Iike dirt, right?

Jesus, Frank,
puII away pIease.

<i>(Gabe)</i>
<i>Right, l mean,</i>
<i>it's really bad.</i>

WeII, I'd Iike to get
a voIunteer from the audience

to come taste
my chocoIate amaretto smoothie

with Live AIchemy.

<i>Who's curious?</i>

<i>No, no. Come on.</i>
<i>Not the crazy bitch.</i>

Gabe.
Who's game?
You want to come up?

Right up here.
WeIcome.

Yeah, it's good.

Thanks for being
brave, yeah.

Very courageous
of you.

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>(Gabe)</i>
<i>Would you believe me?</i>

Most peopIe,
they hear ''aIgae''
and they say ''yuck''.

<i>[laughter]</i>

I'm not afraid
of anything, Gabe.

IncIuding success.

Oh, what's your name?

My name is AIice KIieg.

I watch you
when I sIeep.
Oh.


What, what was that?

<i>ls that so?</i>

This is my second time
on TV this week.

Oh, your
second time, reaIIy?
Yes, Gabe.

I won the CaIifornia
Stack Sweepstakes.
Eighty-six miIIion doIIars.

<i>[audience]</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

I did a press conference that
aired on aII of the stations
in this area.

That's incredibIe.
You are a Iucky Iady.

And we're Iucky
to have you here to be
our guinea pig to try--

Winning has nothing
to do with Iuck.
It doesn't?

<i>No. lt's all</i>
<i>mental training.</i>

Dawn, what the heII?

WeII-WeII, why
don't you ask
your brother?

He seems to be--
Are we in controI
here or what?

Not-Not currentIy.

Oprah says that everything
in our worId is created
on a DNA IeveI

by what we think.

I thought I was a winner.
I won $86 miIIion.

AII right, give me
the word, Rich.
Wait.

<i>(Gabe)</i>
<i>That is just great.</i>

<i>l didn't always think</i>
<i>of myself as a winner.</i>

When I was 1 6,
I was diagnosed
with manic depression.

<i>ln my 20s,</i>
<i>it was called rapid</i>
<i>cycling bipolar disorder.</i>

Now it's just caIIed
borderIine personaIity
disorder.

AIice, maybe come back
to your seat.
No.

Now it's just caIIed
borderIine personaIity
disorder.

Who can keep up?

For most of my Iife,
I Iet my diagnosis
define who I was.

Big mistake.

At a certain point,
I reaIized I had
to get back to me

before my iIIness.

Oh, my God.

<i>Oh, my--</i>
<i>Why are we</i>
<i>following her?</i>

Shh, shh.

I was a summer baby

born in 1 971
in Simi VaIIey,
CaIifornia.

<i>And l've been using masturbation</i>
<i>as a sedative since 1 991 .</i>

We have
to kiII this, Rich.
Okay, kiII it.

KiII it, pIease.
<i>My father was</i>
<i>a commercial baker.</i>

<i>[female voice]</i>
<i>lntroducing Essentis,</i>
<i>luxury hair care</i>

<i>formulated with natural</i>
<i>and organic components--</i>

Do you think
she reaIIy won
the Iottery?

SeriousIy.
Can someone
GoogIe that?

What was her name?

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

Gabe, that was
the best experience
of my whoIe entire Iife.

WeII, um,
you didn't have
to buy me out.

I need the protein.

Hey.

You must be
the big winner.
I'm Rich.

Me, too.

I'm Gabe's brother.
Oh.

So, you own
aII of this?
Gabe and I
sure do, yeah.

I have an idea
for a show.

What kind
of show?
Uh--

How about this?
You want to come in
tomorrow,

we'II sit down,
we have an officiaI
meeting,

and we can hear
aII about this show
of yours.

I'm sure
it's a knockout.

Okay, yeah.
Does that
sound good?

Yeah.
Great.

It's a mindset, right?

Okay.
I'II see you
tomorrow.


Anything she wants.

Huh?
Anything.

Okay.
You reaIize that's
where we are, right?

It's that bad?

We run a company together.
Jesus Christ, where
the heII are you?

Wait.
Uh, I thought
we were doing okay.

We were doing okay
in the '90s.

Not so much now.
We're going to have to start
Iaying peopIe off again.

No, no.

<i>So, they thought</i>
<i>l had this virus</i>
<i>that only cats get,</i>

but it turned out
to just be I BS.

So I couIdn't have
any orgasms.

<i>l was in the hospital</i>
<i>for three weeks.</i>

But I feeI
so much better now.

That is so great, AIice.

<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Should l just</i>
<i>bring it in?</i>

Sure.
Pastrami's mine.

Um, why don't we get
to your idea?

Um, I want a taIk show
with me as the host.

Okay. WeII, it wouIdn't, uh,
be our first foray

into vanity programming.
That's true.

Last year we did
that hobby show.

I think AIice wants
to take over for Oprah.

<i>(Dawn)</i>
<i>Oh, good deal.</i>
That's crazy.

So, you want to taIk
about current events?

No.

<i>(Deb)</i>
<i>A show with guests</i>
<i>and do interviews?</i>

No.
What kind of stuff
do you want to taIk about?

Me.

I'm stiII not getting what
the show is going to be.

Let me, Deb.
Um, AIice directing,
shooting, editing,

sets, costume design,
hair and makeup.
Yeah.
I want aII that.

AII these things
add up

to making creating your own show
extremeIy expensive.

Yeah, particuIarIy when
you're not offsetting
those costs

with income
from seIIing products.

<i>(Deb)</i>
<i>Are we talking</i>
<i>about a half hour or--</i>

Two hours.

How much
wouId that cost?

Two hours.

You're Iooking
at $1 00,000 an episode.

It's more Iike 1 50.

And that times
a hundred wouId be--

That's $1 5 miIIion.

$1 5 miIIion.

My business stuff.


Oh, and I want to come in
on a swan boat.

$1 5 miIIion.

Guys, we're doing this.

<i>[Rich mumbling]</i>
<i>$1 5 million.</i>

Yes. Come on,
it'II be fun.

Like a nervous
breakdown is fun?

Dawn, everyone,
we do this show

or we start
Iaying peopIe off again.

Have you thought about
how this is going to affect
the other brands?

<i>Well, Live Alchemy</i>
hasn't turned a profit
in two and a haIf years.

Same with
<i>Viva Ceramica, San Tropez,</i>
<i>Neo Regenerative.</i>

<i>Neo Regenerative has</i>
never turned a profit.
<i>Neo Regenetif.</i>

Is that how
you say it?
<i>lt's French.</i>

Here's the deaI.
We are dead in the water
without this woman.

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>The almonds.</i>

<i>(Daryl)</i>
<i>All right, leave</i>
<i>the almonds on the floor.</i>

I can cIean them up
after the session.

WouId it make you feeI better
if you were eating, too?

This eating
is not working for me.

The food is distracting
from the work.

I have to eat because
of my new reIationship
with gIucose.

AII right.
You can have
a snack at five of two

and another one
at 2:50.

PIease stop eating
in session.

So, Iike Oprah,
but with a swan boat.

TaIk show.
Uh-huh.

Hosted by...

Me.

Hosted by you.
Yeah.

AII right.
WeII, how about
a IittIe recap?

In case you missed
Iast week's episode
<i>of the Alice Klieg Show--</i>

That's not
what it's caIIed.

That's not
the name of it.

You're off your meds,
you just spent $1 5 miIIion,

you're Iiving
in a reservation casino,

and you're hosting
your own taIk show.

I thought I asked you
not to eat.

It's a banana.

It's in its own container.

I come out

on the swan boat.


And then I taIk
about myseIf.

Is there a show that's
kind of Iike what you want
your show to be?

<i>Oprah.</i>

So, maybe
we shouId watch
some oId Oprahs

and pay speciaI attention
to how each show
has a topic.

I have a topic.
Which is?

Me.

What does that mean?
You know,
just what I Iove.

My hopes, my dreams.
What I Iike to eat.

Who I think is a cunt.
My spirituaIity.

Me.

We need to figure out
how to break this down
into segments.

This is going
be Iive.
Yeah, okay.

WeII, um, we have
reguIating your moods

with a high protein
IifestyIe.

Oh, um,
I want to do
a reenactment.

About what?

Jordana.
Jordana who?

Jordana SpangIer.
Who is
Jordana SpangIer?

A Iiar.

<i>(Gabe)</i>
<i>Donna Keever.</i>

We'II be right
with you.

AIice's.
Huh?

For the reenactments.
Oh, right.
Where is she?

In the booth,
recording her theme song.

<i>You should hear</i>
<i>these segment ideas.</i>

<i>''Matching Colors</i>
<i>to Emotions.''</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>What else?</i>

<i>''To Be a Woman.''</i>
<i>That one's a song.</i>

Something caIIed
''I Can StiII SmeII You.''

''Lucky Foods'',
''You Got Everything,
I Got Nothing.''

Can we pIease, um,
taIk about this?

TaIk about what?

I don't feeI great
about where this is going.

How do you feeI
about where this is going?

I'm gIad
we got to do this.
I got work to do.

Poor sad eyes.

I miss being
around dogs.

I'II take GodziIIa
over here.

Get in.

You want
to taIk camera?

That's the zoom.
That's the focus.

Here's the pan.

Yeah?
And the tiIt.

And up here's
the taIIy Iight.

When that's on,
you know it's recording.

Do you want
to have dinner?
I can't.

Can it be
a work dinner?

Can it not be
a work dinner?

It's just
a restraining order.
It's not a big deaI.

Sounds Iike cops.
It's reaI.

I can't go
within 50 feet of her.

Or SoupIantation.

I've been
divorced twice.

ReaIIy?

Yeah.

Not twice.
I mean three times.

I , uh,
I Iove too much.

Aw.
It's not
a good thing.

I have a swing
over my bed.

I mean, I--

I used to, uh--
It's in the garage now.

Can I make
an observation?

Sure.

I want you
to fuck me so bad.

[both moaning]

(AIice singing with music)
Hang over.

Hey.

I'm going
in there, you guys.

AIice?

We need you
in hair and makeup.

We're aII
very proud of you.

Me, too.

You are ready.

You are beautifuI.

You are great.

You are nice.
<i>ln front</i>
<i>of the, uh, lips.</i>

You are edibIe.

This is the best
I can do for you, honey.

You shouId go
now, AIice.

<i>Good luck.</i>

It's not about Iuck.
Okay.

<i>(Gabe)</i>
<i>Thirty seconds to air.</i>

<i>Camera two to your mark.</i>

Does anyone know
where she is?
We need her in the bird.

We need to get you
in the bird.
<i>(Dawn)</i>
<i>Okay, Grace has got her.</i>

<i>An Aeroknife,</i>
<i>no force or strength</i>
<i>or pressure.</i>

She's doing
the best she can.

Do you have
any questions?

Yeah, when peopIe
see me on TV,

is my face switched around
or on the right side?

You're going
to Iook great.
Thanks.

Have fun.

We go Iive

You're on TV now.

HeIIo. I'm AIice KIieg,

And so it begins.

Lose it.
Twenty to the insert.

This morning I woke up
and there was a pubic hair
on my piIIow

shaped Iike
a question mark.

<i>And it really</i>
<i>got me thinking</i>
<i>of unanswered questions.</i>

Like aII the times in my Iife
when I was supposed to feeI
something, but I feIt nothing.

And aII the other times
in my Iife where I wasn't
supposed to feeI anything,

but I feIt too much,
and the peopIe around me

weren't reaIIy ready
for aII of my feeIings.

How many episodes
did she buy?

<i>To me, it's worse</i>
<i>than heroin.</i>

Worse than any chiIdhood
sexuaI abuse. You name it.

It wasn't untiI
I got off the sugar wheeI

that I reaIIy
took controI of my Iife
for the first time.

Then I went off my meds.

<i>Grape tomatoes.</i>
<i>They're low glycemic--</i>

Did you know that?

Ladies and gentIemen,
meatIoaf cake with mashed

With onIy 433 caIories,
52 grams of protein,

and onIy five
carbohydrants.

I think I'm going
to have a sIice.

Is it carbohydrates
or carbohydrants?

It's carbohydrates.

What's the next piece?
No, we're on this
for a whiIe.

<i>(Rich)</i>
<i>Can Frank tell her</i>
<i>to move it along?</i>

No, this is
what she wanted.
She wanted to--

She wanted to sit and eat
the cake for an hour?
Yes.

Not an hour.
I think it's a good
five minutes, though.

Mm.

So good.

<i>[applause]</i>

Sometimes
I reaIIy wonder
about peopIe.

Whether they stop maturing
emotionaIIy because
of a traumatic event,

maybe a birth defect.

We may never know
what twisted the souI
of the daughter

of a CaIifornia dentist,
and to the crueI and maIicious
betrayer she became.

<i>Come with me.</i>
<i>l want to show you something.</i>

<i>l'm going</i>
<i>to ride my bike.</i>
<i>Come, tag along.</i>

<i>(Jordana)</i>
<i>Your sandwich</i>
<i>has Cheddar cheese,</i>

<i>also lettuce</i>
<i>and some mayonnaise.</i>

<i>Good, good.</i>
<i>That's what l want.</i>

Now, in the manner of girIs,
Iet's share some secrets.
You start.

What a reIief.
Now I can Iet
my hair down.

And by hair I mean
defense mechanisms.

And now that you feeI safe,
you can teII me anything.

When I was 1 9, I went to Iive
with a minister and his famiIy
as an exchange student.

One day we went to the zoo
and I saw a swan choke
on a pretzeI bite

before my very eyes.

You toId
everyone at schooI
I was borderIine.

<i>And when l asked you,</i>
<i>you denied telling anyone.</i>

But every singIe person
that I taIked to toId me
that you said I was.

<i>Everything</i>
<i>was different after that.</i>

And it reaIIy hurt me.

<i>Fuck you</i>
<i>to death, Jordana.</i>

<i>[beep]</i>

Why did it end
Iike that?

We have
a few bumps
to iron out.

Why does it Iook
so inexpensive?

WeII, AIice,
we-we got you up
and running pretty quickIy,

so we're stiII
trying to--
<i>And why doesn't it</i>
<i>look like Oprah?</i>

Because you ate a cake
made out of hamburger
and started crying.

Oprah had the highest
production vaIues
in the business.

She had the best graphics,
the best Iighting, sets, sound.
She had everything.

I'd Iike that.

This is aII doabIe.

Oh, I want
a new opening,

and a new AIice.

<i>And l'd like</i>
<i>more swans, too.</i>

I can bring those
from home.

Yeah.
I want to taIk
to peopIe.

You know,
Iike Larry King.

What was wrong with the girI
who pIayed you?
She just wasn't me.

Can someone
give me a Iift?

Sure.

I don't even know
where to begin.
ReaIIy.

<i>Why don't we try</i>
<i>to get the swans?</i>

She has them at home.
She said she's bringing--

I'm not buying
one fucking swan.


You Ieft
the TV on.

It's been on
for 1 1 years.

I shouId have them
take you to the studio.

<i>[dog growling]</i>

<i>Thanks for driving me.</i>

This is my oId house
from when I was a different person.

Uh, I see you, uh,
got everything by coIor.

CoIors heIp me keep
my emotions separate.

Yeah, I can never keep
my emotions separate.

Have you ever done it
in a bag?

No.

ShaII I take this off?
No, no.

Someone!


Someone's been tampering

How in this worId.

<i>How in this world</i>

She's got probIems.

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>l know, it's very upsetting.</i>
<i>l was very upset.</i>

I cried
for so many days.

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>You said Bill</i>
<i>looked like a drug addict</i>

<i>and that he had no business</i>
<i>working around people.</i>

Her Mom
is kicking her ass.

But she's not paying
attention, cIearIy.

<i>(Mum)</i>
<i>You remember</i>
<i>what you want to remember.</i>

<i>[buzzer]</i>


Now we're aII
paying attention.

<i>Grape tomatoes.</i>
<i>They're low glycemic</i>

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Alice?</i>
Yes, hi.
Thanks for caIIing.

I think you're a genius.
<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>You do?</i>

Yeah.
Um, I attended
your Iast show, actuaIIy.

GodziIIa, come here.

<i>[laughter]</i>
GodziIIa, come here.

[barking and growIing]

That's for menopause.

I Iike it.

Why don't you get
a titty-kini?

I Iook horribIe
in those.

What do you mean
you're not a bikini type?

You know.
Bikini types.
One piece types.

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>You got it</i>

<i>lf you want to wear</i>

<i>And nobody has the right</i>

Come on,

I sure do.

Oh.

This is

<i>[applause]</i>


Nothing.
Nothing.

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>There are two times</i>

<i>l've performed oral sex</i>

Jesus.
Whoa.

<i>And that's when l found out</i>

Oh.
<i>You're a liar,</i>
<i>Jordana Spangler.</i>

<i>You're on TV.</i>
<i>l don't want</i>

Everybody wants

<i>Not everyone is</i>

<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>My name is Alice Klieg,</i>
and WeIcome To Me.

<i>Welcome To Me.</i>
<i>Welcome To Me.</i>
<i>Me, me, me.</i>

<i>And Welcome To Me.</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>l knew if l bit him again,</i>
<i>he would beat me.</i>

And I don't mean, Iike,
on Thanksgiving, you know,

Iike a sexy beating.

I mean Iike
a reaI beating.

<i>He would say,</i>
<i>''That's just how we do things</i>
<i>in Gaithersburg, Maryland.''</i>

<i>Like he was Mr. Big Man,</i>
<i>and he really wasn't.</i>

I was a superior wrestIer,
even though I didn't have
the training he did.

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>l should let you know</i>

that I tried to have you put
on psychiatric hoId Iast week.
And what is that?

It means having you
invoIuntariIy committed
for an observation period.

Oh.
WeII, thank you.
You're weIcome.

I'm very worried
about you.

<i>l feel like you are</i>
<i>a danger to yourself.</i>

Maybe I'm not
where you think I am.

<i>l'm going to read</i>
<i>a list of symptoms</i>

common to peopIe
getting off of AbiIify.

<i>Tell me if you are</i>
<i>experiencing any</i>
<i>of this, okay?</i>

<i>(Dawn)</i>
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>anything to say</i>

before you are sentenced?

I am innocent.
<i>Ha.</i>

But your wantonness
and perversion

have threatened
the sanctity of Canada.

But I never asked
for these or this.

AIice KIieg,
you are found guiIty.

<i>[chorus of voices]</i>
<i>Guilty, guilty.</i>

No.

<i>Mama.</i>

<i>lt's so dark.</i>

<i>Mama. l can see</i>

Yeah, yeah,
I got AIice.

Yeah, copy that.

Miss KIieg.

Who are you?

Hi.
Um, I'm Rainer.

I actuaIIy caIIed
during your Iast show.

I remember.
Yeah.

I just want to say
I thought this was,
Iike, your best show yet.

ReaIIy?
Yeah, you shouId do,
Iike, five shows a week.

I hate waiting.
Like Oprah.

Yeah, I don't know.
I'm writing this paper
about you,

about your invention
of the narrative infomerciaI,

and I was wondering
if maybe you wouId want
to be interviewed.

Okay.
Yeah?

<i>[cell phone ringing]</i>
Same stuff here.

Hey, AIice.
<i>Guess what.</i>

<i>They picked up my show</i>
<i>for five days a week.</i>
Wow, that's great.

And I'm recording my song
with a European orchestra,

and they're studying me
in schooI.

<i>This grad student</i>
<i>came to my show.</i>

<i>He was wearing</i>
<i>a tuxedo.</i>

That's, um,
so great, AIice.

It just, you know,
for the record,

I just want
to say that I don't--
I don't Iike bikinis.

<i>lt's not that l think</i>
<i>that l'm fat or anything.</i>
<i>l just l don't--</i>

They're ready to start.
You know what?
I got to go.

Sorry, I'm at work.
Okay.

Oh.

Ooh, Cindy Sherman.

Yeah, from Laverne
<i>and Shirley?</i>

No, no.
She's a photographer.

Oh.
Wow.

Man, the fact
that you don't know
who she is,

makes you, Iike,
75 miIIion times more radicaI
than you aIready are.

Uh, do you mind
if I--
No
Not at aII.

I Iove
your faciaI expressions.

WeII, thank you.

I've never been
interviewed before.

WeII, yeah, cheers.
CongratuIations.

Oh, is it not good?
I don't drink.

Oh, cooI.
Um, so,
I'm interviewing you

for this cIass
that I'm in right now
caIIed Memoir in Performance,

and when I saw
your reenactments--
I Iove you.

Uh, I Iove the way
that you pIay
with gender

and race and time
and perception
in your work.

I'm just wondering,
what's behind the coIor-bIind
casting for you?

Oh, you mean the skier
in ''Someone's been tampering
with my makeup bag?''

Yeah.
She was
the prettiest that day.

I was prettier
back then.

Do you think
I'm pretty now?

<i>That's what you said.</i>
<i>(Mom)</i>
<i>l said--</i>

<i>[shouting]</i>

It's got 1 70,000

How did you know
I was on here?

I'm monitoring
your web presence.

You've got
some copycats, too.
But they're not you.

I don't feeI so good.

You're not supposed

We've got

Now, that's a Iow

Whew.

Dawn? Frank?
Can you see this?
<i>(Dawn)</i>
<i>Not really, Alice.</i>

Why don't you bring it
on down so the audience
can take a Iook?

Good idea, baby.
<i>No problem, baby.</i>

[aII gasping]

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>l'm burning.</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

Grace, go heIp her

Oh, my--
Get away from me.

<i>(Alice)</i>

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>You should try</i>

Did you teII him

Yeah, I aIready did.

WiII it be

OnIy second-degree burns.

Why did this

Lady Gym is cIosing.

Do you think
I shouId sue the station?

I Iost my job.

You'II find one.

Oh, I can't feeI
my tits.

Oh, don't go.
PIease.

I got to get
a few hours sIeep
or I'II be useIess tomorrow.

I have four interviews
Iined up.

Okay.

Can someone pIease
turn my fucking TV on?

You didn't answer
the front door.
That's right,
I didn't.

I saw the show.

Which one?

The one
that I was on.

I shouId've Iet you know.
Yes, you shouId have.

Where are you going?

These are aII weII respected
doctors, a coupIe of whom
I know personaIIy.

They'd be happy to consider
taking you on as a patient.

You're firing me?
I'm not firing you.

I'm seeing

You shouId try it.

DaryI?

DaryI?

Come back.

No, I'm just eating
a cheese sandwich.

AIice.

There she is.

WeIcome back.
Thanks.

I've got something

Turn page 31 .

<i>Not only did somebody</i>

somebody beat
<i>the Fresh Prince</i>
<i>of Bel Air.</i>

<i>And l just got</i>
<i>a call from KPXN</i>
<i>San Bernardino.</i>

They want you
for a time-buy.

Congrats, AIice.

Thanks.

So, what's on
for Monday?

I want to neuter a dog.

On TV?

Deb's waIking.
WaIking?

Quitting.

No, no, no, no.

Deborah.

<i>She's a menace, Rich.</i>

I can't beIieve
you're Ietting her
come back.

Oh, wait, yeah.
Of course I can.

'Cause you are
a greedy twat.

She has a point.

Go have fun
with your girIfriend.

I'm done.

Go home.
I'II finish up
with AIice.

No, I mean
reaIIy done.
Go home, Gabe!

You Iike being a buIIy?

You seem
a IittIe tense, GabrieI.

Why don't you get married
and divorced again?


She's rubbing off on you.
You don't respect me.

You never have.
I want you to buy me out.

Oh, you're so superior.
I'II have Barb
draw everything up.

Jesus.

<i>l was a veterinary nurse</i>
<i>for six years,</i>

<i>and assisted in hundreds</i>
<i>of these ''pro-said-ures''.</i>

<i>Once again</i>
<i>the reckless copulation</i>

of our animaI kingdom
Ieaves us with a ''tis-nammi''

of puppies and kitties.

Over the next few weeks,
I pIan to neuter my own pets,

<i>and any pets</i>
<i>any viewers would like</i>
<i>to bring by the studio.</i>

It's a pubIic service.

<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>Godzilla is receiving</i>
<i>a mixture of oxygen</i>

<i>and isofluorine gas.</i>

It's reaIIy important,
as you know, to remove
aII the hair

from the penis and waInuts
before we begin.

Let's castrate.

<i>[weak applause]</i>

First cut
is the deepest.

<i>[Joe groans]</i>
<i>We're going to want</i>
<i>to remove the walnuts</i>

from the other tissue.

Now I'm going to tie it off
with the monofiIament.

This is caIIed
a subcuticuIar suture.

And it's going to dissoIve
in case the doggie Iicks
the IittIe wound.

<i>[Male voice]</i>
<i>lf you have a dog</i>
<i>that needs to be neutered--</i>

How are you doing, George?
I'm, uh, need water.

We're doing
a good thing.

<i>(Rich)</i>
<i>Doing this all week.</i>

Let's start
with the easy stuff.

Here's what Gabe wants.

That's just hurtfuI.
What about Landon?

He's stiII on the fence.
He's crackpot.
Never hit him.

Not the point.
If he decides to sue,
he wiII win.

What are you
pIaying at here,
Richard?

She wants
to be teIevised.

She caIIs this guy ''taker,''
said he was a ''prostitute
of the mind.''

Accused this married
mother of three

of steaIing
assorted cosmetic products
from her in 1 991 .

And the Iist
just goes on
and on and on.

How much they aII want?
I'm not done.

The ASPCA is going
to be here tomorrow

about what she's doing
to those dogs.

Okay.
Thank you, Barb.
Richard.

They're going to shut
your ass down, Richard.

What's going on?
<i>l'll be brief.</i>

No more neuterings, okay?
AII this shit has got to go
by tomorrow.

Take the fucking dogs
out of here.

I can't house them anymore.
I can't do it.

<i>All right?</i>
<i>That's just</i>
<i>health code stuff.</i>

<i>(Dawn)</i>
<i>Does he know</i>
<i>we're live?</i>

ShouId I say
something?

There are 31 Iawsuits
fiIed against New Vibrance

from peopIe
you sIandered on the air.

So you better get that
pretty binder out and make
aII these go away

or a Iot of good hard working
non-psychotic peopIe wiII Iose
their jobs.

<i>lf you hurt</i>
<i>or come close to hurting</i>
<i>someone in my employ again,</i>

you can find
somewhere eIse
to do this nonsense.

<i>No discussion.</i>

AIso, stop screwing
my brother.

That's probabIy best
for everybody.

Have a fantastic show.

<i>[applause]</i>

No, this is not
the show!

Okay.

<i>[kettle hissing]</i>

That's aII for today.

AIice, you have
another 40 minutes.

I'm done for today.

Can someone pIease
get my dogs?

Let's get AIice
her doggies.

And you heard the Iady,
that's a wrap.

Can I go home, too?

Come on, guys.

Where's my car?

He's coming Iater.
Why Iater?

You finished up
earIy today.
Oh, yeah.

<i>Hi, this is Gina.</i>
<i>l'm sorry l wasn't able--</i>

<i>Sorry l wasn't able</i>

<i>Hi, this is Gina.</i>
<i>l'm sorry l wasn't able</i>

<i>So, l want everybody,</i>

<i>Again. ln and out.</i>

<i>Just relax</i>

<i>[Clerk]</i>
<i>Ms. Klieg,</i>
<i>are you still there?</i>

I'm aII aIone.

PIease.

I Iive in a casino.


Oh, thank God.
Thank God.

Oh, gosh,
you're the onIy
normaI person I've seen.

Back on the happy piIIs.
Look out, worId.

When do you
get out?

Um, 24 hours.

I haven't taIked to you
since the burn unit.

I've caIIed you,
Iike, a miIIion times.

Look, it's better.

Aren't you happy
to see me?

Ted has the dogs.
Oh, my God,
I forgot.

As soon
as they Iet you out,
you need to get them.

He can't keep them.

Wait, you're Ieaving?

You're a terribIe friend.

You onIy care
about your own pain.

I'm sorry
you hurt so bad,

but that doesn't mean
other peopIe

aren't vuInerabIe
or sensitive.

And just because you made
a career out of it

doesn't mean
that other peopIe
don't have feeIings.

You don't get
to fucking cry
right now.

I am crying
right now.

I Iost my job.

And I toId you,
and you haven't asked me
once if I was okay

or if I needed
any heIp.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

<i>l'm sorry.</i>
<i>lf you want,</i>
<i>l can give you money.</i>

I don't want money.

I just want
my friend.

Gina, wait.

Gina.
<i>Fuck you for making me fat</i>
<i>on your stupid show.</i>

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>What? That's all</i>
<i>l have left?</i>

When you win $86 miIIion,
you don't actuaIIy get
$86 miIIion.

So, conservativeIy speaking,
that's aII I have Ieft.

That's a fortune.
It's stiII a fortune.

If I were you,
I wouId put this
in a safe pIace right away.

It's in the bank.

I mean to invest it.
I wiII heIp you.

If you make
a few smart choices,

you can have
a very comfortabIe Iife.

Did you get
our fIowers?

Yes. They were very nice,
thank you.

You feeIing better?

Much.
Yeah.

Back on my meds.
Oh, good.

So, what's
on your mind?

I have
six shows Ieft,

but I want to do
one Iong one.

WeII, we just assumed
you were done.

AImost.

What did you have
in mind?

Something big.

Okay, we can do big.

<i>[doorbell chiming]</i>

<i>Oh.</i>
<i>Alice.</i>

I know
you're mad at me.

And I'm sorry.

I'm reaIIy sorry.

<i>l accept</i>
<i>your apology.</i>

Okay.

<i>l do hope</i>
<i>for you, Alice.</i>

<i>l hope you have</i>
<i>a good life.</i>

Thanks.

<i>Goodbye, Alice.</i>

Can I come in?

Hey, Gina.

It's me.
I know I'm not supposed
to be caIIing you,

but I just wanted you
to know that I'm having
one Iast finaI show

and I want--

So...pIease come.

but I'm Iearning.

And tonight,
I'm going to make it right.

<i>Anyone who adopts</i>
<i>any of these loving friends,</i>

<i>gets a year's worth</i>
<i>of dog food and treats,</i>

<i>a doggy bed,</i>
<i>and a luxury travel crate.</i>

<i>Do we have</i>
<i>the number on the bottom</i>
<i>of the screen, Dawn?</i>

Yes, we do, baby.
<i>Thank you, baby.</i>

<i>[audience gasps]</i>

What's going on, Dawn?

AIice,
if I'm not mistaken,

<i>that's the Carousel of Life.</i>

Ooh.

That Iooks
pretty damn good.
It does.

Cue the turntabIe.

<i>â™« Before l can</i>
<i>Truly shine â™«</i>

<i>â™« But this is my time â™«</i>

<i>â™« lt is a time</i>
<i>For understanding â™«</i>

<i>â™« This is my time â™«</i>

<i>â™« For me to share â™«</i>

<i>â™« Me â™«</i>

She's off
to a reaIIy great start.


Do we have Gina yet?
No Gina.

<i>(Alice)</i>
<i>There are so many things</i>
<i>to be thankful for.</i>

But right now
I wouId Iike to express
some gratitude

towards a certain
artistic feIIow.

Is Rainer Ybarra
in the house?

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>l wanted to thank you</i>
<i>for calling me an artist,</i>

<i>because the moment you did,</i>
<i>so many lost years</i>
<i>had meaning.</i>

CouId I just
say something?

You need to go
back to your seat.

<i>[applause]</i>

This is when
I pretended to drown.

[no audibIe diaIog]

[bIowing whistIe]

<i>[laughter]</i>

She's going to be
just fine.

She reaIIy is.

<i>[applause]</i>

And now
I wouId Iike to honor
a genuine Iove-maker

<i>who l really care about.</i>

GabrieI Ruskin,
wouId you join me
by the CarouseI of Life?

<i>Once in a blue moon,</i>
<i>life gives you</i>
<i>a one-way ticket</i>

<i>to that deep</i>
<i>erotic play land that</i>
<i>only exists inside of us.</i>

Ugh.
<i>Shining captain</i>
<i>on a sea of takers,</i>

you docked in my port
and it wasn't even raining.

<i>[audience]</i>
<i>Aw.</i>

<i>[audience whistles]</i>

Go sit down.

<i>(Dawn)</i>
<i>Still no Gina.</i>

<i>(George)</i>
<i>Should we use</i>
<i>a reenactor?</i>

Use a reenactor.
Yeah.

Use a reenactor.
Get Gina reenactor ready

<i>for New Apartment 45</i>
<i>to the roll.</i>

She's going
to be devastated.

How are we doing
in adoptions, Dawn?

<i>(Dawn)</i>
<i>Nothing yet,</i>
<i>but the lines are open</i>

<i>and operators</i>
<i>are standing by.</i>

This is for Gina.

<i>(Gina)</i>
<i>Well, l think your new</i>
<i>apartment is great, Alice.</i>

I don't know
if I can do this.

Maybe I shouId go back
to the haIfway house

where I have been Iiving
for most of 1 996

after Iosing my job
at PaIm Desert AnimaI ControI.

You're ready to have
your own pIace, AIice.

I , Gina SeIway,
just know that you are.

It's aImost as if you
beIieve in me more than
I beIieve in myseIf.

<i>l really do.</i>

<i>[applause]</i>

<i>[cheering]</i>

<i>(George)</i>
<i>Hey, Grace,</i>
<i>Miss Selway has arrived.</i>

Oh, my God,
Gina's here.
What!

[no audibIe diaIog]

I'd Iike to read
from a prepared statement.

''Dear Gina,

''thank you for being
the onIy girI who wouId speak
to me in the sixth grade.

''Thank you for Ietting me sIeep
hoIding on to you during that
reaIIy bad period in 1 989.

''Without you,
I couId never have
made it through my 20s,

''much Iess
become a miIIionaire
and taIk-show host.

''You are the kindest,
most patient person
I know.

''I don't deserve a friend
as IoyaI as you, but I sure
am Iucky to have one.

''You couId have given up
on me seven miIIion times,
but you didn't.

And for aII those times,
I wouId Iike to present you
with the foIIowing.''

<i>[applause]</i>

Woo-hoo.

<i>â™« There was a time â™«</i>

<i>â™« Of innocence</i>
<i>Before the darkness fell â™«</i>

<i>â™« So many lessons</i>
<i>To learn â™«</i>

<i>â™« Before l could</i>
<i>Truly shine â™«</i>

<i>â™« But this is my time â™«</i>

<i>â™« lt is a time</i>
<i>For understanding â™«</i>

<i>â™« This is my time â™«</i>

<i>â™« lt is a time â™«</i>

<i>â™« For me to share me â™«</i>

<i>[cheering]</i>

And we're out in ten,

nine, eight,
seven, six,

<i>five, four,</i>

<i>three, two, one.</i>

<i>[door opens]</i>

You want me
to stay?

<i>[dog growling]</i>

You know, I think
I'd better bond
with the beast.

Oh, I got you
a present.

Um--

What am I supposed
to do with this?

Um...anything
you want.

Okay, I'm going
to go ahead.

You go ahead,
do your thing.
I'II caII you tomorrow.

Okay.

<i>[Alice chuckles]</i>

<i>Bye.</i>
