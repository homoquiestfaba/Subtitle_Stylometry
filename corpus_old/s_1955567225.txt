You could use some help.

Karla, go ahead and go.

Really?
Yeah. Dale found Agnes.

She should be here in 15 minutes.
Awesome.

Who wants to go to the park?
I am!

Let's go.

Mommy, your turn.

Is daddy coming to the fair?

No, sweetheart.
You're gonna see daddy next weekend.

And maybe you'll get to see Cheryl too.

Do you like Cheryl?

I don't know.
I think she's nice, Frankie.

And she's smart.
She's very smart.

She's gonna be a doctor.
Yeah, I know.

And I want you to really
make friends with her, okay?

Are you friends with her?

Yeah.

Yeah, I am.

She, daddy and I,
we all love somebody like crazy.

Do you know who that is?
Me!

You!

You.

We all love you.

Mommy, can I get ice cream?

You know what, how about
we check out all of our options first...

...and then maybe we'll come back.

Okay? Come on.
Okay.

Can I get my face painted?

How about we wait until
the line is a little shorter?

We'll come back, okay?

Marco.
Polo.

How old your boy?
Six.

He obviously likes to hide.

Marco.

Oh, Marco.

Oh, no.

Am I lost my little Frankie forever?

Where could he be?

There you are.

It's really important.
Don't move, okay?

I haven't seen your face.

I don't know your license plate.

You can get away.

If they asked me,
I won't know anything.

Let me tell you something.

As long as my son is in that car...

Wherever you go...

...I will be right behind you.

No matter what.

Or you're gonna kill me.

That's what he wants.

What he wants me to do.

But I told him for $10,000,
we can make a new plan.

You want your boy and I want $10,000.

Karla, we have to get out of this field.
Unlock the door.
