We could you and the children
further inland to pass.

Yes, let me speak to him.

What?

Uli?

I did not know you were promoted to field marshal.

Max would not really
Field Marshal may tease.

Customize your good to your mother?

Now you're the man of the house.

On your marks!

Do not cry, Uli.
All is well.

Everyone is sometimes afraid, Uli.

Watch.
Make a eagle. I do it too.

High from heaven.
On rocks and hills...

Sees both of us...

And keeps us safe.

I love you too.

Preparing.

Aim.

Fire .

Two months after D-Day Start
the Allies with Operation Dragoon.

The goal was to occupy southern France.

517de The Parachute Regiment combat
was used for this purpose.

August 15, 1944

Provence, France
5:03 pm

Jump over five minutes.
Get ready!

Please note that the Americans.

Stay together.

Stand up. Hands up.
Do not shoot.

Do not shoot!
Come here.

Do not shoot.

Do not shoot.

What have we here?

What is that?

Where is your unit?
Tell me!

On your knees.

Are you alone?

Are you alone?

Grenade!

Never been so happy to see you.

I'm alone.
What?

I'm alone.

Where's the rest of your unit?

No idea.
Where's the rest of yours?

My name is Curtis.
I'm Rossi.

Thank you.

Pleasure.

What are you looking for?
I promised my buddy a souvenir.

A SS skull ring, Luger,
or something.

I have no idea where the landing zone from here.

You got a compass?
Yes, I have.

Give me a minute.

Where is yours?
Lost in the jump.

This sleeve was faster than I expected.
A drop in the night gives a rough landing.

This mountain range there...

Says that we are here.

More than 20 km from the landing zone.

How is it that we so far have landed?
Blame it on the scouts.

When I jumped, I swear to you, for giving me
above the sea already left jump.

That was hellish.

I hope they wait for us in Les Arcs.
That is 3 km past the landing zone.

Here, we better go.
Are you ready?

Yes, only grab my gun.

Rossi!

Okay.

Let's see.
I'll go first.

No, I will go.
And you give me coverage.

Okay. Go ahead.

Do not move.

Democracy.
Lafayette.

Curtis?

Sergeant?

Are you but two?
We could not find anyone else.

This is Corporal Rossi.
Sergeant Jones, Bravo Company.

What are you singing?

This is an old song.

That's not really uplifting.
Can you remember anything else?

Not directly.
What happened to you?

My platoon did.
Seemed like a good idea when.

What would your mother think? If everyone
of a bridge jump, do you do it?

All my friends jump out of airplanes.
That's pretty much the same.

What is the reason that there should be?
It's a warrior thing.

Ten battle.

I'd best explain it, but do not
that you would understand.

Also good.

What are we gonna do, Sergeant?

We can not just sit here and wait.
The Germans will broadcast patrols.

Who knows how long it takes for us is our unity.

The battalion would have to meet in Les Arcs.
That's what we do.

With luck we are in the evening.
How far is that?

I would say...

A 19 kilometer.
I need to know in miles.

Can not convert kilometers in miles?
That was one of the first lessons.

They gave lessons in there, but
I have no lesson learned.

This is... about eleven miles.

I do not know what you think, but I
joined the paratroopers to be properly disposed.

Not that I should wear my shoes
to have to search.

Way we will probably encounter a lot of Germans.

Yes, like you assume.

We'll have to improvise.
What did Colonel Graves again?

<i> A few men can really make much
problems as they are on the right place. </ I></i>

We do what we practiced.
Then we get it.

Why we're here, is not it gentlemen?
A plane jump...

Countries behind enemy lines in the middle of the night.

And all for $ 50 extra per month.

I'm a parachutist.
I am a commando.

I jump with a parachute from any plane in flight.

I give this to me as a volunteer,
I've known the dangers all too well.

<i> I serve a mighty force,
famous for his actions during war... </ i></i>

<i> known for its usability and peace.
It is my honor and prestige oath to uphold... </ i></i>

<i> in everything I am and do. </ I></i>

I said to myself every day.

Why not surprise me that, Curtis?
Let you feel invincible?

When I was little, I went with friends
to the pier at the beach of Long Beach.

There was a roller coaster.
Cyclone Racer.

The Cyclone Racer, you know him!
Yes, that is famous.

They say the first fall is so steep,
thing people are dying.

Yes, exactly.
We bought our tickets.

We ran the first place.
And when we left...

We went that steep slope.
We made the security release...

And climbed onto the front of it trolley
and dangled our legs over.

And then suddenly...

160 km per hour.

Your legs tremble and I think to myself,
I'm coming!

I'm going to lose weight and fall to pieces.

Could not you have anything less adventurous can do
like a mohawk your hair do?

It gets better.

At the moment we come out of that first dive,
we climb out of the front cart...

And go back.
By the time that the ride to an end...

Seated completely in the last carriage.

Do not sure why I did it.

Maybe I liked
to the death to outsmart.

Was that the story you told
to the 517de to get?

Should I disagree.

Major siez looked at me once to
and knew that I was perfect.

Keep going.

Have you ever heard of that Nazi Aryan babies?

No, tell me.

Nazi Hitler want a pure race, right?
Yes.

So he looks for people with Aryan features
and take their babies away.

Once they are born, comes the Third Reich
to come and take them away.

Nazis come in and take the baby away
from their mothers when they are born?

Yes, that is correct. Hitler has those places where he
all those young Aryan people gather...

Nazis to small babies to make.
As a factory, they are like horses bred.

They do some tests.
Put them in a room together.

They have never met each other,
they know each other at all.

Not "delicious perfume, nice to meet you"?
No, nothing like that.

Throw balboekje out
and there is the door.

I've got to admit, I did not know
.

Wait.

You know, they have a name
for such places.

Yes, but those places are not directly intended
for kids to make.

Kids who grow up, put on uniforms,
conquer the world, our guys dead...

They will foot the bill.
If not in this life then in the afterlife.

You really think so?
Yes, I'm sure.

Wait.
I want the map view.

Now look.

What do you think?
Is it me?

It is short...

But handsome.

My own handsome soldier.

They are beautiful.

Is that for me?

I do not know.
Is yet to be seen.

Hey, handsome.
Do you even open the door?

Careful.
Thank you.

Beware of your head.

Good. We can continue.

What do you think if we jump?
What do you mean?

You know, where do you think
if you jump from the plane?

Some count the seconds before they hit the ground...

Others think about how they are going to die.

Just want to know what you think.

I actually think of anything.

To what do you think?

Mostly about my girlfriend, Charlotte.

This seems mostly to calm.

What are you doing?

There is a pebble in my shoe.

Throw it.

All clear.

I think you got him to graze.

Damn pebble in my shoe.

You know, Rossi?

I'm going to recommend this
for a medal.

Go in search of your Luger, Gates.

Let's see what you were doing,
you naughty, naughty Germans.

What do we have here.

Guess whose face at work I look.

Please mein Fuhrer beautiful.

What have we passed, 5 to 6 km?
What do you think, Curtis?

I think so about.
How much is that in miles?

Multiply it by 0.62.

I was never good at math.
Probably because I'm kicked out of school so much.

Why?
Usually by fighting.

I've seen you fight.

Really? Where?

Camp McCall.
You had the record for the most knockouts.

Right?
Yeah, I've always though.

Is that you?

I thought you were bigger.

What you got there, Sergeant?

My father has given me.

Would not you should go to church?
Yes, that's right.

Mother is Catholic, Baptist's father.

Ben while growing
far been to church.

Why are you not a chaplain?

One of those sacred kneusjes.

I can also "holy" are
among the Gentiles.

Will you sometimes repent?

Let me know when you're ready.

Well, grab your stuff.

Come on, let's go further.

Your mother waits in the car.

I'm sorry.
I was the time it lost.

It is best to wait,
because they sit on comfortable chairs.

Dad, I think I know what I must do.
I feel it.

But I... It is hard.

If you feel the calling to serve,
you should follow it.

You will be much more useful as a chaplain.

But I feel that it is not enough.

What do you mean?

I enlisted in the paratroopers.
No.

I'm going to be commando.
Really.

It's already happened.
No!

Have you seen the 2nd Battalion?
They are an hour ago that direction assumed.

Warning.

Go look.

I grab him!

Come on, who's got my Luger.

Hey, take my picture again.

Come on, quickly.

I'm gonna send home to my mother.
Will her proud.

You look like a big game hunter.

What are you doing?

Put â€‹â€‹the camera down.
We go.

What is it?

Someone's watching us.

At the dike, on the right flank.

Are you sure?

Yes. I'm sure.

Do not shoot.

Do not shoot.

Are you alone?

Yes.

Step forward.
Slow.

I'm Sergeant Jones.
I'm Emilie Moreaux.

Do you know French?
My mother is French-Canadian.

Do you speak English?
A little bit.

Can you bring us to Les Arcs.
There are more Americans.

I can take you over there.
I am of the resistance.

Resistance Friends are captured,
they keep them fixed, not far from here.

I can bring you to Les Arcs
if you first help me to free them.

Germans, how much?

Five, maybe six.

Can they help us or not?
What is she saying?

Her name is Emilie. She says she
can help us but wants our help first.

With what?
Help with what?

She wants us
a group of her friends liberate resistance.

The Germans keep them here not far from fixed.

No.
You bring us to Les Arcs.

And then we come back to help you,
but not before.

We got many soldiers.
Then it's too late, they're going to kill them.

Please, I beg you.

She says that it can not wait.
Then it may be too late.

Dan let her just here.
We do not need her help.

We can find it yourself Les Arcs.

Please,
I need your help.

Please.

How do we know this is not a trap?
They can best collaborate with the Nazis...

And lead us right into a trap.

I think not.

Agreed.
Take us there.

Thank you.
Follow me.

What did you tell her.

I said that a few men a lot of problems
make, as they are on the right place.

Of course, you did.
You are the Holy Jones.

The patron saint of strangers in the woods.

Forward.

Wait.

Can I?

Is good.
Thank you.

There's a parachute.

An American?

Yes, it looks like this.

We need to be sure.

Lie!

It's one of ours.

Did he see us?
Yeah, you know. He swings his wings.

What the hell?

To the other side of the field.
Move!

Is he gone?

Yes, I think he's gone.

Curtis, help me to cover him.

I'm speechless.

I saw it in the pawn shop of Mr.
. Steven.

Thank you.

You want our last day together
not wasting me to kiss.

You need me every week to send a picture.

So I can see what you see.

What would I do without you.

This is easy.

First, close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

Remember me that you hold.

And then you breathe.

What if I do not return.

I come get you.

What is the purpose?

Nothing has changed.
Think.

She has brought us further away
and we know nothing about her.

You know nothing about her.
Put us a try?

Her father was a doctor. Moisture in the first
war, would then no longer touch weapon.

The Germans invaded, they joined the Resistance
. He did not think they did.

Three weeks ago the Gestapo
learned about her, seized her father and brother.

And they tortured and executed.

She's got more than you invested.

What is your real name?

I know you understand me,
more than let you know.

Why do you ask?

Because I want to trust.

Trust me.

We will soon be doing, or
it is not our work.

Rossi, I'll take these two.
You go around along the East.

Fri
Make the back and we see each other again at the front.

You and Emilie remain here and give me coverage.

Stay here with Curtis and
keep the Germans in the eye.

I'm a parachutist.
I am a commando.

I jump with a parachute from any plane in flight.

I give this to me as a volunteer,
I've known the dangers all too well.

Sorry.

It is my honor and oath
prestige to uphold...

In everything I am and do.

I serve a mighty force
famous for...

Sorry, I'm ready.

Hands up!
No, do not shoot.

Do not shoot!

Warning.

Safe.

All is well.
Those soldiers are there to help us.

That was good cover fire.
She can shoot pretty.

Where is Gustave?
They took him in for interrogation.

We got him all night
screaming.

There is still a prisoner.
Look after the other building.

Mr. Lieb, Mr.. Jacques.

Thank you.
Anytime.

Hello.
Jacques.

Open the door!

The door is locked.

Let me inside.

Rossi, come on.
Open!

He's dead.

He's dead.

Let's get you cleaned up.

But you special talents and a calling.
You're a preacher.

God does not want you die
in some foxhole.

He does not want anyone
in a foxhole dies, Dad.

But your calling is special.
You have to find another way to serve.

A safer way.
Exactly, you have not thought about it.

I've thought about it,
I've done nothing...

Then think about this.

It is good to support and provide guidance...

If I can do that, I will do that.

I know I should be,
I can do the most good.

Yes.

I have you learned your own choices.

This changes everything.

I'll wait in the car with your mother.

Thank you.
We must bring them to Les Arcs.

This is the least we can do.

We are here, right?
No, actually we're here.

In order to Les Arcs, we must take this road
, but that is full of German patrols.

What do we do?
Here is a path through the hills.

This is used by shepherds.

This is a detour.
At least five kilometers.

But much safer. We know that forests
good and the Germans never.

It will take longer, but it is safer
?

Is that it?
Much safer, yes.

Waiting.

There's a vehicle.

Stop!
Hands up.

Soldiers of the 517de.
Good to see you.

Sergeant Jones.
Lt. Woodward, this is my driver, Stewart.

Are the Allies already far
broken through in one night?

Yes, certainly. We have the Krauts harshly.
Have you encountered resistance?

Yes, a few.
We have a German postal disabled.

Some partisans liberated.

Then you will be pleased to hear that
10 km away, this way you sit battalion.

That's good to know.

I think we have a leak or something,
against something we will have driven.

Yes, that's a ruptured fuel line.
That I might recover.

Do you sometimes thirsty?

So, Lieutenant, what are you doing here exactly?
I care for the recovery of ammunition.

It's just you and Stewart?
For now.

There is a war going on, people
no surplus.

Have you heard of that officer
that his head was cut off?

No, I do remember.
Was in a small town in Italy.

I can not remember its name
, but...

Across the street had the Germans
a piano to use.

It was guillotine  thread.
Whatever.

If you tell it you may call the guillotine wire.

So which officer sits in his jeep with his
windshield folded down.

He drives maybe a good 25 km / h.

This thread grabs him right in his throat.

It was his mouth.
I heard it was his throat.

His head came immediately.

I have all of his teeth picked.

It was his mouth.

Well, that should be it.

Thank you've helped me.
No problem.

Whence are you?
Seattle, Washington.

There it is wet and rainy.

Many totem poles.
Sometimes I feel small on the totem pole.

The lonely man.

Excuse?

Do not you mean the lone man on the totem pole
?

Yeah, right.
Lonely man.

And you then?

Whence are you?
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Torrance, California, born and raised.
Good.

Since I've never been.
Have never been outside the Northwest.

Have you fought?
We are no opposition encountered.

Have been a few times been fired,
but it's pretty quiet.

Besides, if we are attacked,
we burn the paper and...

We have no lists or inventories.
Can I see your gun here?

Excuse?
May I?

I'm sorry, I do not understand what she says.
She wants the gun.

Beautiful.

Can I shoot it?
Did you hear that, Rossi?

She thinks you're beautiful rifle.

She can fold
fixed and stabbing into her handbag.

I know we normally have to be frugal with our
ammunition, but she wants it fires.

Do you mind?
I have no problem with that.

The Germans are long gone.
Yeah, try it.

You need to convert the safety.

Can he shoot well?

He â€‹â€‹is not as good as he thinks he is.

I heard you my name,
which you had it?

I'm sure I can shoot better.
You want to bet?

What is she saying?
She says she wants a shooting.

She thinks she's better than you.
I really want to see.

No, we're not...

She wants to bet.

Okay.
I take her money.

He says he does not like
money will decrease.

He's too cocky.
Why are we betting?

What you got, Rossi?

This is good. Yes.
She does not mind.

What do you want?

I said I do want her money, but...

A kiss for me as well.

A kiss?

Yes, a kiss just as
French women can give.

Agreement.

Looks like we have a deal.
This is going to be awesome.

Is this the fair sometimes?
It is 1000 meters, about anyway.

That's not fair, she can never touch.
I can maybe not.

That's the idea.

I'm a fool but you just set.

You must first let the lady go.
Yes, but do your best.

No, I prefer the second.
She wants you to show how to do it.

What the lady like.

Well, three shots. Nothing more.
Three bullets, that's good?

Yes, that's good.

Do you want to...

Thank you.

Handsome shot.

It is pretty nice shoot.

Standing  she never hit.

She does it standing and put you fool.
That's what she'll do.

Congratulations, that was impressive.

Thank you.

I admire your courage. Countries in
enemy territory without artillery support.

No knowledge of the area.
I have a cousin who is in the Navy,

for them is totally different. They
sleep every night in the same bed, hot food...

Daily news of home movies.
I'm not saying it's easy...

But it's not what you do.

Movies?

I can not remember when I've seen one.

Yes, sir?

When the last time you saw a movie?
Do you remember that?

It's been a while ago.

"Watch on the Rhine" with Paul Lukas.

Lieutenant, I wanted to ask you...

Where were you before you landed in Provence?
We were in Italy.

We.

Where exactly?

We landed in the south.

In Suvito Vecchia?
Sergeant, we need to go.

You need to your battalion.
You may be entitled to...

What are you landed?
I do not have time for your questions.

You need to get away, and that's an order.
I ask you a simple question.

What are you landed in Italy.

Are you crazy?

They are Germans.
Take their weapons, search them.

You're going to tell us exactly who you are.

I hate nothing worse than
sneaky nasty Nazis.

Seat.

Frisk them again.

Look after his pockets.

Nothing forgotten.

They have nothing.

Who is Francois Poulenc?

I have to just give my name and rank.

Who is Francois Poulenc?

Schneider, Klaus.
Soldier.

Why are you here?
What is your mission?

Material destroy officers
murder, inquire, what?

Talk!

I need to know what your association with this man!

I'm not mad, Sergeant.
I know how it goes in your country.

Americans injure no prisoners.

You tell me right now
or I swear I blow your head off.

That you did not do.

Now...

All bluff.
That's all this is.

Like I said.

I know Americans.

This fine French people,
who are not like Germans made.

I need to know who Francois Poulenc and
why you see his name on paper with you.

And it immediately.

Poulenc was one of our best informants
in Provence.

And you would 'm going to meet.
In Le Tournay, in his apartment.

And then?
We had to relieve him...

Fear that the Allies
him with important data would intervene.

I would not worry.
The resistance will be to him care.

Jacques will bring the prisoner and return with reinforcements.

Where does he go?

For his final journey.
I do not care.

All I know is that
he returns with reinforcements.

Emilie and I will bring you to Les Arcs.
Good.

He knew that the Germans were you?

A U.S. soldier with a German binoculars?

Did you know that buyer that wearing?
We do not on the battlefield.

Yes, officer back.
Patton drove even always easy front.

That was close.

This is the way to Les Arcs.

Good.

Do not shoot, it's Jacques.

And? Everything went well?

Kill these guys Germans?

Yes, I suppose so.

And they eat them.

How did you find us.
You have left traces everywhere.

Is everybody ready?
Good. Then we go.

We have a tank and a halftrack.

Maybe 12-15 infantry.
Are we, or do we wait?

No, we have a task to accomplish.

A few men and a lot of problems.

We need that tank off.

That will not be easy.

We must destroy that tank.
Can we count on you?

This is our country.
Course we help you.

Stay here on this ridge.
Then can you halftrack flank.

I want you out firing rifle grenades.
Understood.

I, Rossi, Philippe, we go to the
riverbed. Wait until they pass.

And then we accompany them on their left.
Clear?

Then we have that tank off.

What we have for that tank?
A surprise.

A magnetic charge.
This is perfect.

You, come with us.

Jacques.

Take it.

For luck.

Thank you.

Wait until they disappear.
Not before.

Everybody out.

Fast.
In coverage.

Go left!

I need that tank to get you.

Lie!

Warning.
In coverage remain.

Do you...

I do not recommend for a medal.

You have a medic needed.
Medic!

Is okay.

You're a bad liar.

Is okay.

Grenade!

Do not go.
I'll get you out of here.

I'll get you out of here.

I do not recommend for a medal.
Do not go. I'm getting you out of here.

Dad, I think I know what I must do.
I feel it.

If you feel the calling to serve,
you should follow it.

I enlisted in the paratroopers.

God does not want you die
in some foxhole.

I'm a parachutist.
I am a commando.

I jump with a parachute from any plane in flight.

I give this to me as a volunteer...

I'll have to come get you.

I'm sorry.

Close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

Remember me that you hold.

Remember me that you hold.

And then you breathe.

And then you breathe.

I've wound as best connected.

But I had no relationship.

How do you feel?

It tastes good.

Please, take some.

You need to eat.

You should be healthy again.

Eat.

Food.

Eat.

Usually, it's terrible.

But if you have not eaten for days...

Then it's not so bad.

My name is Erich Neuman.

Erich.

And you?

What is your name?

Your name?

Are you an officer?

Excuse?

I do not know what you mean.

Your stripes.
Officer?

Officer, yes.

This is my brother.

He has learned English.

He's interpreter.

A translator.

He tried to persuade me
to learn English.

This is your brother?

Yes.

Can he English?
Yes.

Where is he?

Where?

He's...

He was killed in Italy.

Italy?

Then he lucky.

I've been to Italy.

Is he still there?

He's dead.

What?

Death.

I had a friend...

Together with me in Italy.

He was my best friend.

I do not even know why I'm talking to you.

I do not know if you understand me.

I promised his mother...

I would keep him safe.

Do you have a family?

Yes.
Yes, kids?

I have a son.

Do you have a picture of him?

Is this your son?

He's wearing your uniform.

I hate that uniform.

And I'm supposed to hate you too.

I'm supposed to want to kill you.

Do you miss your brother?

And would you not kill me?

I...

'm...

Tired.

I'm too tired.

Sorry.

High from heaven.
On rocks and hills...

Sees both of us...

And keeps us safe.

Elsa!

Uli.

You make me think of my son.

Someone's coming.
Wake up.

Wake up.

Wake up.

Democracy - Lafayette.

I'm coming.

He's wounded. We are only two of us.

Captain, everything is safe.

That's been there.

Corporal...

Have you shot him.

No, I did not.

We have a wounded soldier.
Remove the medic.

Captain, he's my prisoner.

So I find that I toehoort.

Also good.

This is a beautiful Luger.

I want you to inform the emergency room.
Let them know we're coming with injuries.

How did you do with the progress report?
It's almost done.

Excuse me.

Can you tell me whether Sergeant Caleb Jones
was brought here?

Jones?

Jones, wounded, transferred to a
first aid in Draguignan.

And Harland Curtis?

This is a corporal.
Corporal Curtis...

"K".

I'll be back.

You have nothing.

Is there anyone else with you?

No.

But they have destroyed the tank.

I thought you'd want.

Is this Curtis?

Thanks, Emilie.

Emilie's not my real name.

Yes, I know.

Do you have a real name?

I'm sorry. Can you wait outside,
I need him further care.

I'm sorry about your family.

I'm sorry about your friends.

Can it?

In memory of Harland "Bud" Curtis
and the brave men of the 517de PRCT.
