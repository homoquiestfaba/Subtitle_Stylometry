Who are you?

Marina!

Go, go, go!

Mama!

Call the police!

Here ya go, champ.
Thanks.

You're blockin' my view.

Peanut?
It's time you made a change.

My suggestion is
go someplace warm,

get outta the heat.

That the suggestion?

Okay, it's not a suggestion.

Since you put it that way,
how long do I got?

No rush. Finish your drink.

Hey, Enrique.
Chris, how are you?

Carlos.
Hey, Chris, what's up?

I got you guys set up
right back here.

Here you go. VIP.
Anything you need, let me know.

You guys have a good time, okay?

Anything these guys want...

Got it.

Okay.

Manny!

Hey, you got any peanuts tonight?

Andy, you know the boss
don't like peanuts.

Why not?

They don't have any class.

Oh, boy.

I like 'em.

Here you go.
Thanks.

Tell me somethin'.

What's a guy gotta do
to get a job around here?

Try tipping the bartender.

Come on. I'm serious.

Sometimes they need people
at the door.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Excuse me, ladies.

Come on.

Okay, okay. No more in the club.

Sit down.

That's not good enough.

<i>Sometimes I think
you're such a prude.</i>

You know what?

You're no good to me
with your nose full, all right?

Plus, I promised your father.
You're my business partner.

People come here to party.

I don't need you to tell me
why people come here.

Okay? I don't need trouble.
Trouble costs me money.

Do you understand?
Yes.

We're gonna have to start
stacking 'em on top of each other

if we don't get any bigger.

All right.

Bigger.

I know, sweetheart...
the coke ain't yours.

Keep your hands on the car.

Tango Six, we're on scene.

Let me see your I.D.

You're a big girl,
you know this is possession.

That lieutenant needs
to catch a beatin'.

No, do that and even my father
couldn't save us.

Good evenin', Mr. Troiano.
Andy.

Enrique.

Hey, you look great, man.
Yeah, you too.

Donatella.
You look fabulous tonight.

<i>Chris, mi amigo.</i>

Signor Versace, you don't look
half bad yourself.

Welcome to Liquid.

How we doin' tonight?

we'd do better if we raised the cover.

Well, let's not get greedy.

Just an idea. You're the boss.

We want to keep the money
coming in, not going out.

Chris, look. It's so cool.

What is this?

It's called publicity.

People come here to see celebrities

and bitchy socialites like you, not me.

It's all about South Beach
six months after we opened up Liquid...

building boom, real estate boom,
tourism boom.

Honey, in this town...

you're the star.

You're dangerous and mysterious,

and people want to know
more about you.

Get this outta here.

Madonna! Madonna!

Yo, man! what the hell is this, bro?

You gonna let everybody in but us?

Damn right, with an attitude like that.

This is bullshit!
I've been here for 45 minutes!

Ciao, Sandra.

Oh, beautiful.
How are ya?

You look nice, baby.

Come here.

Now what?
what's that around your neck?

This thing?
Yeah.

It's new jewelry.
I thought we talked about this.

Stop it. Stop it!

Mr. Troiano.
Andy, it's "Chris. "

We got a situation outside, boss.
we need you.

No way I'm not going in that club!
I asked you to calm down.

Hell, no, I'm going in the club.

Andy, step aside.
Kim, get back to the door.

Is there a problem?
Damn right.

This punk with the suntan's saying

We can't come in the club
'cause of how we're dressed.

Suntan.

And what are you guys, ballplayers?
Yeah, semi-pro.

Semi-pro!
Oh, yeah.

Well, I'm very sorry,

<i>but we only let professionals
in my club!</i>

Hey, ignore him! Come here!

You wanna come to my club?!
Hey, get over here!

Calm down!
Let me go!

There's a van across the street.
See the van?

It's been there since
5:30 this afternoon,

nobody's gotten in or out of it.

You've been watching it since 5:30?
Yeah. It's my job.

Don't look at it.
who is this?

<i>Could be the Enquirer,
could be the cops,</i>

but I figured you should know
before you belted this guy in the face.

All right.

Handle this.
All right.

Let's talk for a second.
Calm down.

Now, listen. There's a van
across the street. You see the van?

Don't look at the van.

It's full of cops, which is why
I brought the boss back inside.

Now, you're not getting
in this club tonight.

<i>But... you come back here
tomorrow night dressed to impress,</i>

I will walk you in myself,
and the club picks up the tab.

That's the deal.
Do you want it or not?

VIP Room and bottle service?
VIP Room, done.

All right?
All right.

You all right, Manny? You okay?

Let's get this rope set back up.

Andy.
Yeah.

A blackjack? what are you gonna do?
Let's take a walk.

I want to see if those college boys
are the only ones who fast-talk.

Hey, where ya goin'?!

what do you think?
I think it was the cops.

Not paparazzi?

Nah.
why not?

Paparazzi would have stayed
and took your picture.

All right.

Get that ready, will you?

<i>To what do I owe the pleasure
again, Lieutenant Houlton?</i>

I'm just feeling a little unloved because
my name wasn't on the list last night

and I had to miss Puffy and all.

You're looking for love?
Buy yourself a puppy dog.

Just stop hassling my customers.

<i>Since Liquid opened, drug arrests
on South Beach are up 20%y.</i>

So?
They're club-goers.

I don't like your people or your club
corrupting my city.

My club is clean, and I'm clean.

I'm gonna do you a favor.

You wanna come in and feel the love,
I'll leave your name at the door.

I'll take a rain check.

But tell your buddy Madonna
and all your other fancy friends

that I'll be there...
sooner or later.

Okay.

Enjoy yourself while you can.

And I don't need my name
on your bullshit list.

Look at this. Real nice.

Hey, Danny.
Yo!

You got a count?
Yeah.

About 250, minus expenses.

Health inspectors. Code enforcement.
Sanitation boys.

You know they jacked up
the juice again last week?

Cost of doing business.
Don't take it personally.

Do me a favor.
Cut me out two Gs.

Beautiful girls, beautiful girls.
Get these two in right here.

VIPs. I'll take care of
these two right here.

Chris?

Two guys are asking
to see the manager.

All right, send 'em in.

Are you Mr. Troiano?

I'm Chris Troiano.

You look just like the magazine.

Yes, 'cause that's me.

A friend of ours saw the picture

and said maybe you can help us
find some people.

what are you guys, cops?
Just friends.

They are supposed to be
friends of yours.

Do you know Mike Block?

Phil D'Amato?
No.

Davey Harris?

Tony Pizzo?

Eddy Boyle?
No.

Slava Petrov from Staten Island?

Somebody shot his wife dead,
you know.

Very sad.

How about Christian wentz?

Like you, he come from New York
to be a big shot.

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

The man we're looking for
takes money from Slava Petrov.

I think the money comes to you.

Slava Petrov's money is our money.

Our money, our club.

I think we partners now.

You're talkin' bullshit.

In the club it's okay the people
think Chris is the boss.

But you remember...

Who is the real boss.

No worries, Mr. Troiano.

I take care of this.

Come here!

Come here!

Get over here!

Hold him right there!

You piss in my club?!

Huh?! You wanna piss in my club?!
Now I piss on you!

Get off!

<i>Throw 'em in the Dumpster!
I mean in the Dumpster!</i>

You see that puddle over there?
Get all that up.

Hey, boss.

I hope you don't mind me askin',
what was that all about?

How do I know?
They were drunk.

All right, they were drunk.

Drunk or not, somebody pisses
and lights a fire in my club,

I'd be a little bit worried.

Don't worry about it, all right?
I ain't worried about it.

No one's burning me down.
Good.

I'm actually starting to like this job.

You okay, buddy?

How ya doin'?

Hey, look out!
Hey!

Thank you.
You look like you could use some help.

I think you're right.

Last time I was on a pair of these things,
they still called 'em skates.

Well, the first lesson's free.

Oh, yeah? what about after that?

We'll negotiate.

I can be a pretty hard negotiator.

We'll see about that.

Yeah. I'm only telling you
what I heard.

Albie.
Yeah?

Tell Danny and Manny
to get over here.

You sure about this?
I'm tellin' you what I heard.

All right.

Girls, would you
join me for a second?

What's up?

we're checkin' I.D. S tonight.
Every one of 'em.

And I don't want to see
any candy being sold.

Why? what's the matter?

We're taking a raid tonight.

Where'd you hear that?
Doesn't matter.

They're gonna pretend like
they're checking I.D. S,

but they're gonna be looking for dope.

You sure? 'Cause I didn't
hear anything like that until tonight.

You're talking about losing
a lot of money on account of a rumor.

I think it's bullshit.

Maybe.

Just do it.

You know the rules... no I.D. S,
no nightclub, no partying.

No weapons and no drugs
allowed in my club.

You can't get in the club.

Keep movin', keep movin'.

Because.

You have I. D? You can't get in.

All right, I know these two.
Come on.

You got an I. D?
No.

No I.D., no club. Sorry.

Not tonight. You gotta go.

Come back another time. Sorry.

Not tonight.

It's not too late. we could still
make up part of the night.

You cost me money.

I just told you what I heard, Chris.
I'll make a call if you want.

<i>- Yeah, well, do something.
All right.</i>

I don't know why you trust this guy.

Let's go, let's go!

How the hell did he know?

Let's give 'em some room.
Right this way, officers.

Police. Everybody stay calm,
get against the wall.

Let's check some I.D.s. Let's go!

Everybody gets checked for I.D. S...
everybody.

<i>This can't be everybody.</i>

All right, go look.

Everybody face the stage.

Everybody calm down,
get against the wall.

I want everybody checked
for I.D. S right now. Let's go.

Are you 21?
Let me see your I.D.

I don't get it. The place is clean.

Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Outside!

Thanks for keeping us safe,
Lieutenant.

Appreciate it.

I'll be back, you prick.

Two bottles of beer.
Give this guy a whole bowI of peanuts.

I thought you didn't like peanuts.

A little something for you
after this thing.

Thank you.

Take a walk.

What?

So, how'd you know?

What do you mean, how?

You don't understand the question?

Who told you?

I heard it, that's all.

I pay a lot of money to hear things,
and I didn't hear about tonight.

<i>I want to know how you heard about it.</i>

What does it matter? It worked out.

It matters because
it makes me suspicious,

<i>makes me wonder what else
you know that you're not telling me.</i>

So, I need to know.

You wanna know?
Yeah. what are you into?

That guy, the lieutenant there...

Yeah, the prick Houlton.
Houlton, yeah.

The wife of one his guys told me.

A cop's wife?
Yeah.

I met her rollerblading.

You're banging a cop's wife?
well, you saw the guy.

She says he takes his job
too seriously,

so somebody's gotta do it, right?

What? I'm serious.

You're banging a cop's wife?
Yeah!

She said I should phone in sick
because they were gonna raid the joint,

so I told you.

What? What?

Next assignment:
Bang Houlton's wife.

No, you bang Houlton's wife.
No, no, that's for you!

That's your next gig!

Bye.

Now, you see that over there?

<i>That is a view.</i>

You did not get a view like that
back in the old neighborhood.

I heard you know
Big Head from Bath Beach.

Big Head? The one who was
gonna marry Anthony's daughter?

Yeah.
I went to Utrecht with her.

Of course I know Big Head.
You went to Utrecht?

Tell me something.

What do you miss most
about New York?

What do you always miss?

The food.
The food.

Most definitely.

Still, there's worse places
to run away to, you know?

What do you mean?

You got your reasons
for coming down here, I got mine.

Yeah.

There are worse places
you could run away to.

No doubt.

Relax.
Shadow opens in a month.

They're looking to bury us.

They hired my D.J. S,

they're comping my lists,
which I'm sure they stole,

they're offering crazy deals
to my promoters.

<i>we got a national rep now.
Did you hear what Elle said?</i>

<i>Elle said we're the hottest club
in America.</i>

<i>Vanity Fair, New York mag...
everybody's on our bandwagon.</i>

<i>Variety. Variety calls me
some hunky impresario.</i>

Now, how bad can things be
if I'm a hunky impresario?

All right? we're doing great.
Be proud of what you accomplished.

I'm not afraid of competition.
Nobody's gonna bury us.

Shadow's not competing...
they're looking to screw us.

I think they're the ones that have
been making all those complaints...

you know how the city's been on us
about underage kids

and crowd control
and sprinkler system bullshit?

I'm telling you, it's them.

I got it, I get it, I'll take care of it.

But let's not worry about it
until they open. All right?

So you're just gonna let them
steal it from you?

I think you know me better than that.

Come on, come on, hurry up.

Let's go.

Come on, let's load up the van.
Let's go. Let's go.

Merry Christmas!

All right.

Nothin' but the finest.

Let's have some fun.

Red or white?

Whatever. Just make it a good year.

Play ball!

Goin' long.

Yeah!

Go long! Go long!

Go long!

I didn't know we stocked this brand.

Boss.
Yeah?

She just said that we don't
stock this brand here.

There's some new Russian stuff.
We're gonna have that for a while.

This is the new good stuff.

Hey, boss!

Go long! Go long!

You go. Go. Go long.

Again. All right.

This could be
a little difficult to accomplish.

Our friend has a complete faith

<i>that you can accomplish
anything you put your mind to.</i>

Next we're building Joia restaurant
and the Bar Room lounge.

Van Dyk and Oakenfold are gonna D.J.

It's gonna be really hot.

I already got commitments
from Jennifer, Puffy,

Gloria Estefan, the Donald,
my whole gang.

And we're franchising Liquid
to other cities...

Liquid Lounge Las Vegas
and Liquid Lounge New York

are already on the fast track.

I'm meeting Rudy's people
next week at Gracie Mansion

while the liquor boards are doing
their due diligence with the licenses.

I'm telling you guys,
it's gonna be beyond huge.

It's all my doing.

But you know, at the end of the day

I could find the cure for cancer,

and I'm still only
gonna be known as who?

Madonna's girlfriend.

That's right.

Cheers.

You didn't look too excited
to see Carlos and Enrique last night.

What's your problem with those guys?

<i>What do I care about them pendejos?</i>

They're just pissed 'cause
the Russians spilled their drinks.

Yeah?

Take a couple of these.
You'll swell right up.

My cousin O.D.'ed on steroids.
I won't take 'em, and neither should you.

well, that's why I don't overdo it.

I just do it 'cause it gets me there faster.

You want I should spot you?

No, no. I'm all right.

You gotta have somebody
watch your back.

All right. On three.

One, two, three.

<i>Bellissimo, bellissimo.</i>

<i>- Grazie, Mr. Versace.
But it isn't mine!</i>

I'm wearing Christian Dior tonight.

Hey, Gianni, how are you?
Danny.

Yeah?

<i>Chris, a friend of ours wants
to catch up with you tomorrow.</i>

Tomorrow's not really
a good day for me.

<i>You wouldn't refuse a friend,
would you?</i>

Where?

Larry, meet Baya.
How you doing?

Andy.

Hey. Ya see this?

Doin' all right?
what you drinkin' there?

It's yours.
Your bartender made it.

Fresh.
All right, all right.

No, no, I'll take the beer. Go ahead.

Okay, have a good time.

You settle down.
Give me my drink. Come on.

Sorry.

Come on, Olivia, open the door.

Will you cut the crap? Open up!

What's going on?

It's her. She's been
messing around again.

If you don't open the door,
I'm breaking it in!

Come on, come on.

Oh, no. what are you doing?

See this?

This is what I'm talking about.
Look at you!

Stop it!

Stop it! You're not my father!

Stop it!
Andy, clean that up for me.

Come on, we're going.

<i>- Ciao.
Good morning.</i>

<i>Ciao.</i>

Signor Versace?

How's Olivia doin'?

Yeah, I signed her in,
got her bedded down in the rehab.

She'll do all right.
Be good for her.

Oh, my God.

Lieutenant Houlton.
How'd I know I'd see you today?

Do us both a favor
and can the smart-ass for five minutes.

You seen him?

His name's Andrew Cunanan.

He's wanted in four murders
across the country.

I know he's been to your club.

I also know that half of South Beach
was at your house last night,

including Versace.
You seen him?

I can't help you out.

Look, Officer, this...

He's mourning the loss
of a friend right now.

This guy wasn't at the party
or the club either.

Who asked you?
You asked the both of us.

What's your name?
Andy.

Andy what?
Andy Burnett. what?

Get against the wall.
Pat him down.

Get against the wall.
You wanna bring us downtown?

Keep your mouth shut.
Don't move.

Your boyfriend go to
the same charm school you did?

You got nothing better to do?
It's a big city... 30 other clubs.

You gotta mess with me?

Hey, lighten up.
I'll be in touch.

<i>Be in touch.
Touch this.</i>

I can't stand that guy.
I can't stand the sight of him.

He likes you too.
Scumbag.

I'll let Danny open up.
Let's get outta here, clear our heads.

I can't believe you're
dumb enough to let me drive this.

You haven't driven anything yet.
Open it up. Come on.

There you go.

What the hell is this?

They're probably
just trying to jack the car.

They're in a $90,000 car themselves.
why they want to jack our car for?

Lose 'em.

What the hell are they doing?

Scumbags.
who is it?!

It's those Russian bitches.

Son-of-a-bitch!

Keep the car straight.

Damn it!

Take the next right.
I'm gonna reload.

Okay.

You got some kind of problem
you're not telling me about?

No, that's just a warning.
No.

Pissing on the floor, that's a warning.
These guys are shooting bullets.

If they wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead by now.

Give me the keys.

That's a real comfort.

Let's get out of here.

1963 went that way.

You said we're going fishing.
I dressed to go fishing.

What are you fishing for?

You think this is the pier
at Sheepshead Bay?

I'm surprised they let you on the dock.

Good morning to you too.

Come on, untie us.
Hurry up, before they lock you up.

The water's beautiful, isn't it?
No.

No? why not?
I don't like the water.

I can't swim. I'm a city kid.

You can't swim?
No.

Neither could I.

I learned how, though.
Did you even try?

Yeah, I tried.
Every time I tried, I sank.

If you're gonna be hanging out with me,
get your act together.

Change the way you dress.
You look like a schlep.

Whaddya mean, I look like a schlep?

There they are, right up here.

Christopher.

Hey, brother.
what's up, man?

How ya doin'?

I didn't know you were friends
with Jimmy Buffet.

Funny.

Chris.

How are ya?

Glad you made it.

You guys want a cool drink?

How about a mojito?
Two mojitos?

Two is good.
Get 'em two mojitos.

You like fishing?
This guy can't even swim!

No, I can fish.
I can't swim, but I can fish.

Give him a pole.

Come inside.
There's no line.

You'll figure it out.
You're a smart boy.

We won't be long. Don't worry.

Mojito.
Thank you.

Hey, you guys got
any Dramamine or anything?

'Cause I'm feeling
a little seasick right now.

Do it over the side, man.
No, I just want to go in the bathroom.

Can I just go in and find
some medicine or something?

Go inside behind the bar.

Yeah, there, man.
Thank you.

Don't touch any of our things.
No, I won't.

<i>Get it into your head, Chris.
This is win-win for the both of us.</i>

<i>There's nothing else to discuss.</i>

<i>Andy, come back outside,</i>

now!

You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

Yeah?
Thanks. Yeah.

<i>- I got a bite!
Mira!</i>

Bring it in the boat!

I learned that from Jimmy Buffet,
all right?

Hello. Looks like
they got some company.

It's the nightclub guy,
and he's got somebody with him.

Do you recognize him?

Gotta be somebody if they brought him
for a meeting with Allie Boy.

How we gonna I.D. Him?

I got an idea.

You ain't said a word to me
the whole ride back.

What?

You ain't said one word to me
the whole ride back.

You wanna tell me what
that was about?

Nothin'. Mind your business.

You're the boss. You want me
to play dumb, I'll play dumb.

But I gotta tell ya something.

If you went to Allie Boy
for anything at all,

you might as well
put a gun to your head.

Allie Boy?

Yeah.

I don't remember making
any introductions.

Why would I need to be
introduced to Allie Boy?

Everybody knows who Allie Boy is.

Okay, I've known him
since we were kids.

He heard about the Russians
taking a shot at us.

He thought he could help.
He offered. That's it.

So what's he gonna do?
Nothin', all right?

I told him I could handle
what needed to be handled.

End of story, end of questions.

End of questions.

Here we go.

Okay, Dave,
he's leaving the marina now.

Good afternoon, sir.
How ya doin', Officer?

License and registration.

I got a license,
but I don't have a registration

'cause the car belongs
to a friend of mine, so...

Sir, can I search the bag, please?

The bag, please, sir.

Keep your hands
where I can see them.

I suppose this belongs
to a friend too.

<i>why don't you cooperate</i>

before your warrants come back

and you find yourself
deeper in the hole?

Keep grinning, tough guy,

and your bargaining's over.

Is that what we're doing?
Bargaining?

Mike Hawke. Eastern District
Organized Crime Task Force.

Charlie Glaser, FBI Miami.

Good to meet you.
Eastern District?

That's New York.
Aren't you a little far from home?

Not really. what are you
doing with that guy?

Recognize any of them?

Yeah, that's Alphonse. "Allie Boy. "
Head of the Colombo crime family.

We've been working him
since he's been down here.

Today we got him at a meeting
with Chris Troiano.

South Beach hotshot.
Probably a front.

He brought along this wise-ass muscle
who works for him, Andy Burnett.

He was in possession of a weapon.

So you leverage that to flip him,

and that gives you
eyes and ears on the inside.

It's a nice plan, except...
Except what?

He's already on our side.

He's an undercover cop.

Sorry we don't have any bikini babes
up here serving champagne.

This'll do.

Haven't heard from you lately.
Things are happening.

We know that.

Troiano's branching out in South Beach
and trying to move to New York.

His girlfriend Olivia's fronting for him,
and you're his new right-hand man.

Seems he's one of Allie Boy's
biggest earners.

I don't have that nailed down yet.

Bullshit.
Allie Boy's gotta be behind him.

I'm not hearing any of this from you.

When were you gonna tell me about
getting shot at by the Russians?

It'll be in my report.
You're a cop, Andy.

Even in deep cover, don't you think
getting shot at justifies a phone call?

The Russians are connected
to a Slava Petrov.

They had some bad business with Chris,
they feel they're owed.

Partnership in the club
is part of the payment.

what about the Allie Boy sit-down?
what about it?

I didn't know Allie Boy was on the boat,

and you know damn well
I got pinched as soon as I got off.

You know what I think?

Maybe you're getting
to like the life too much...

the cars, the boats,
the broads, the booze.

Look, Mike, you knew this thing
was gonna take time.

Chris, he's just a means to the end.

You want to follow it to Allie Boy,

or do you want me to bust this kid
on steroid and burglary charges?

I got that nailed down.
Don't get smart.

I'm not gettin' smart.
Yeah, you are.

No. You guys brought me in
to do the job.

You gotta let me do it
the way I know how, Mike.

Months ago we had nothing.
Now I got a sit-down on Allie Boy's boat.

I call that progress.

You know Allie Boy's got a 12-gauge
Mossberg below the deck?

We can't prove it's his,
but it's enough to hold him

until we can get these
other charges to stick.

What about the Latin twins?

They show up with briefcases,
they go behind closed doors with Chris,

they leave without briefcases.

So when were you gonna
tell me about this?

I just did.

A narcotics angle, then.

Is he moving it for himself or Allie Boy?

There's stuff moving through the club,
but I don't know whose hands are dirty.

As far as I know, it's just club kids
and Chris lets it go.

You wanna know about narcotics,
talk to Lieutenant Houlton.

Guy'll help you out.

He's got a hard-on for Chris
on a drug charge

worse than a newborn baby wants tit.

You're a font of useful information.
I try.

These are the new rules:

If I found out you're not
telling me everything,

I'm gonna have to believe
you've gone native.

That's the day I'm gonna pull you out.

And I won't care if you're
on your way with a shovel

to dig up Jimmy Hoffa,
you got that?

Andy?
I got it, Mike.

Stay in touch.

Mike, think you could work on
getting me a clothing allowance?

These clothes
are like 1963 or something.

Chris.
Yeah?

It's Johnson again, man.

That greedy prick.

He outside?
Yeah, he's outside.

Send him in.

What's going on?

The fire marshal wants more money.

Been taking care of his whole family.

Let me take care of it.
Hold it.

He doesn't want anybody but Chris,
so stay out of it.

Okay.

Mr. Troiano.

You have a problem.

Just one?

The city has just issued
new occupancy capacity formulas

that are gonna impact your seating.

Oh, is that so?

So that means I'm gonna have to
let more people in my club?

No, I'm afraid your legal occupancy
will be cut in half.

Effective immediately.

What is this?

It's bullshit.

Let's keep it civil, Mr. Troiano.

I'm only here to make sure
that you comply with the code.

Danny, ask this crooked prick
how much it's gonna cost me.

How much?
How dare you.

How dare I? what's the number?

I'm calling the office right now
and I'm gonna take you in for bribery.

Oh, yeah?

You're sure that's what
you wanna do?

All right. In that case,
let me give you a reason.

What are you doing?
Hey! Hey!

What are you doing?

I'm gonna get you closed down!

Settle down.
Manny, get him out of here.

You won't be able to open a hot dog
stand when I get through with you!

Come back in. Any time.

You all right?
I'm all right.

Just chill out!

He's under a lot of pressure right now.
Everybody's squeezing him.

He's not gonna get away with this.

You want to get closed down?

You've had your hand out so long

you're forgetting
about your neck right now.

You go to the cops, everybody loses.
You follow me?

Hey. Do you follow me?

Yes.
Now, let's talk. Come on.

He deserved it.

Johnson's the third guy
double-banging me this week.

You're gonna have to pay him
twice as much.

Yeah? So what. It was worth it.

I come down here to start over,
you know?

Build something.
Leave a lot of stuff behind.

I started it up with my sweat.

There's a line of a hundred people
with their hands freakin' stickin' out.

Everybody thinks they deserve a piece.

Everybody thinks they're entitled.

Sanitation, Health Board...

fire marshals...

How about big boss Allie Boy?

<i>Yeah? How about you, Andy?
How much do you want?</i>

Or maybe you're already
taking your piece.

That what you think?

I'm just pissed.

Hey.

You forgot these at the club.

You might want to be careful
next time.

Okay.
Here we go. Here we go.

Two more steps.

One, two...

...three.
Surprise!

"The bitch is back. "

I love it. Thank you so much.

This is great.
welcome back.

It's all right. It's club soda.
Boss's orders.

While we welcome Olivia back,
let's just take one moment,

we gotta say good-bye to Danny,

who's been with Liquid
from the very beginning,

at the steering wheel,
going back home.

We wish you nothing but luck,
my friend,

and I don't think I'm alone
when I say:

May all your ups and downs
be between the sheets.

Let's have some fun, all right?

You guys good to go?
Yep.

<i>So far the police
are not telling us what led them</i>

<i>to the black BMwluxury car</i>

<i>at a remote park at Key Biscayne,</i>

<i>but inside the trunk they found
the bodies of the two men</i>

<i>identified as Alexi Papov
and Dimitri Kroutik.</i>

<i>Police sources say
they suspect both men last night</i>

<i>were victims of a mob-like hit,</i>

<i>and there were bullet holes
in their car</i>

<i>indicating there may have been
a high-speed chase</i>

<i>before the murders.</i>

<i>we'll be back
with more in a minute.</i>

This wouldn't have anything to do
with our little boat trip, would it?

How do I know?

What do I care?

Well, you should care.

We could have to answer
some really important questions soon.

What are you talking about?

We had a brawI
with these two dead guys

in front of a dozen witnesses,
not to mention a car chase.

So what if the cops pull
the slugs out of that BMw

and find they match a gun
registered to you?

You gonna say you lost the gun?

They're gonna say,
"why didn't you report it lost?"

They shot at us first.
They're dead!

<i>Nobody can arrest them.
They can arrest us. we're the live ones!</i>

Think about it.

Yeah.

Okay.

All right.

I'll be right back. wait here.

Everything all right?

Come on, we're going for a ride.

Let me just grab my phone.
No.

You won't need it.

Where we headin', boss?

Get out.

Start walking.
what are we doing?

You never been to the 'glades, Andy?

No. why would I want to?

There's the gator.

Maybe he smells dinner.

Go on.

Sometimes you gotta
feed the gators, Andy,

<i>or they'll come out of the swamp
and eat you.</i>

What the hell are we doing here?

You know, back in Bath Beach,
there's two ways to stay out of trouble...

you either pay someone off

or make sure nothing ties you
to anything that could be trouble.

Nothing, nobody.

So what's that got to do with me?

Officer Dave came by
with some disturbing news.

Like what?

You were right.

They pulled some slugs out of the BMw,
just like you said.

They're looking for a match.

Now you're thinking.

Look at you.

You don't like it out here
in the boonies, do you?

Why would I?
City kid.

It's hot out here.

Lieutenant.

You're under the gun, Mike.

From you?
Message from the chief.

Your little pet project's
becoming a real epic saga.

Really.

Running up a big bill,
got nothing to show for it.

Then we got these dead Russians,
not to mention your boy on the inside.

what about him?

I.A.'s been asking questions
about his conduct.

I mean, look at the way he's dressing.

Look, Lieutenant, I vouch for him.

Jesus Himself could vouch for him.
You know what it's gonna be with I. A...

"What are we doing? Hosting this guy's
long booze and broad party?"

It's just a matter of one break.
He's high and tight with Troiano.

Tell your boss that he took him
to a meeting with Allie Boy.

Now, that establishes a connection.

We're getting close.

I understand, Mike,
but you're not getting the message.

You're running out of time.
This thing dries up, it falls on you.

I know that.

Your proposal, your project,
your responsibility.

If your boy ends up
on the wrong side of I.A.,

that's gonna come to you too.

You need to press it
or pull your man out.

<i>Christ, Andy, you are not
helping the Miami P.D.</i>

Or the Feds dressing like
Calvin Klein here.

Not to mention I.A.

Come on, Mike, Chris wants me
to fit in with the people we deal with.

Like the dead Russians in the BMw...
is that what you call fitting in?

What's that supposed to mean?

It means this: I put a guy's picture
on a bulletin board,

he's nobody to me...
he's a bad guy, fine, I nail him.

I gotta spend some time with him...
interrogation, courthouse, this, that...

I wind up saying, "It's a shame
the guy's a hood. He's good company. "

I'm not spending every day
with him like you.

You know what I'm sayin'?
No. I don't have a clue.

I mean, he's no picture
on a bulletin board to you, Andy.

He's a real flesh-and-blood guy,
and that can be dangerous.

Are they asking questions about me?
The question has come up.

They wonder if you're
getting too involved.

Once the case is made,

it's good night to the amazing girls
every night at the club, the nice clothes...

once the bust comes, the party's over.

The party's my job!
I can handle this thing.

I believe you.
But we're out of time, Andy.

Your boy Troiano, he's about
to have a meltdown any minute.

Why?

Well, you remember Davey Harris?

Yeah, the Russians mentioned him.
He's an old friend of Chris.

He just got pinched for
drug conspiracy and murder.

He's facing a long time.

And Chris used to run with
the Bath Avenue crew.

"The Binger," they used to call him,

because he did so many crimes...
bank stick-ups, drugs, hot cars...

and maybe even a few murders
for the Allie Boy crew.

According to some new information,

Harris was involved in a homicide
of a Russian housewife a few years ago.

Marina Petrov. Late wife...

Slava Petrov, yeah.
Right.

Jesus.

That's why Allie Boy whacked out
the two Russians, then.

The Russians were getting close
to their golden goose,

so Allie Boy had 'em whacked

to protect the money laundering
going through the club.

Look, Andy,
I want you to take this.

Take it.

What, do they want me
to wear a wire?

They're ready to pull the plug.
Oh, Mike. Jesus.

The Feds are asking
what we're waiting for,

I.A.'s circling like vultures.

They're all wondering
what we're doing here.

They think I'm holding out?

If Davey Harris rolled
and that's enough...

It's not enough, not with Davey's record.
Nobody's corroborating his story.

Look, whatever Troiano does,
I need it on tape, now.

And I'm not asking.

They picked up your friend
Davey Harris in a sweep.

That's tough luck for Davey.

<i>It doesn't look good
for you, either.</i>

What do you mean by that?

You knew him a long time.

You did things
with this Davey, am I right?

A long time ago.
It doesn't matter.

They have him on a conspiracy case

and that shooting
from a long time ago.

He's looking at 25 years to life.

<i>So you figure at some point
he's going to talk,</i>

<i>and then they come looking for you.</i>

You think Davey's gonna roll?

He's 35 years old.

He's facing the rest of his life in prison
with no possibility of parole.

You tell me.

Look, what if I get word to him...
I pay him to keep his mouth shut.

The minute he says a word,
no more paychecks.

The guy's got a family,
and it's worked in the past.

Sure, for 18 months,
even five years,

but not life with no parole.

Maybe he doesn't like
all the success you have in Miami.

So what? That's my problem.
Yes, it is.

But your problem could become
our friend's problem very quickly.

You know what?
You don't need to lay this out for me.

It ain't gonna happen.

I hope not.

You have a lot of friends, Chris.

I'd hate to see you closed down.

Yeah? You'd hate to see
the suitcases stop?

No one can deny that.

But whether the suitcases
are there or not...

We will take care of you,
Christopher.

Go, go, go!

what?
Come on!

Hey. I'm glad you're still here.
Let's go for a ride.

Where we goin'?
I'll tell you in the car.

Come on.

That little blood-sucking scumbag.

After everything I did for him?

I brought him down here.
I gave him a life, some dignity.

He was making money hand over fist,
and he does this to me?

What did he do?
Danny Hayes never went back home.

He got a backer, and he's gonna
open up some new megaclub

right down the block from us.

So what?

I want to tear
his tongue out, so what!

I want to whack him so bad
my teeth hurt.

Chris, you gotta use your head
right now, okay?

You got a good thing
going down here.

You go doing something crazy,
you're gonna mess everything up.

I got a job to do.

You with me or not?

You in or out?

I'm here, ain't I?

Have you got a plan?
Yeah. I'm gonna go to the front door.

I'm gonna pound on it, and I'm gonna
put the fear of God into him.

He's gonna run out the back,
where you grab him.

I grab him.

What do you want me to do
when I grab him?

You grab him,
I bop him on the head,

We roll him up in a rug,
go feed him to the gators.

Chris, you're talking about risking
spending the rest of your life

in a Florida prison
over this piece of crap?

That's what you want to do?
There ain't gonna be any body.

Okay?

You goin' soft on me?
I'm not going soft on you.

Just don't go shooting up
the neighborhood like wyatt Earp.

Nobody's shooting anybody.

We hit him over the head,
we dump him, we're done with it.

All right.

This is the street right up here.

Hey.

What are you waiting for?

Let's go, let's do this.

Go around back.

Hurry up.

Hey, Danny!

Danny, come on out!
we need to talk!

Come on! Danny!

Open up!

Danny, come on, open up!
It's me!

Come on! Come on!

Come on, Andy.

I'm sorry, man.
I didn't mean to cross him.

Please. Please, no.

Hey! Danny! Open the door!

Hey. Did you get him?

Uh, no, he went over the fence.
what do you mean no?

I came around the corner,
he barreled into me with this gate...

Are you kidding me?

You screwed up!
what do you mean I screwed up?

Let's go. we don't have time for this.

You should have had him.

You should have waited to knock
until I got back there.

I was counting on you to get him.

Count on yourself next time.
You grab him and I'll knock.

You would've screwed that up too.

Where do you think he went?

You just forget about him for now.

Look, I'm sorry about, you know...

That's all right. It happens.

What's done is done.

I'm gonna head home.
what do you say we take a little dip?

I can't swim. Remember?

You don't have to swim.

You could just stand
in the shallow end.

Feel the water. It's nice.

Go ahead. Go ahead.

Come on,
what are you waiting for?

Look, I'm sorry about what happened.

I just want to go home, all right?

You're not gonna go in?

You're not gonna go in the pool?

I'm not going in.

Why not?

What?

What are you looking for?

Huh?

What?

Think I'm a rat?

You think I'm a rat?

Satisfied?
Put your clothes back on.

Now I'm going home.

This is bullshit.

<i>...then we roll him up in a rug,
go feed him to the gators.</i>

<i>Danny Hayes never went back home.</i>

<i>He got a backer, and he's gonna
open up some new megaclub</i>

<i>right down the block from us.</i>

<i>So what? I want to tear
his tongue out, so what!</i>

<i>I got a job to do.
You with me or not?</i>

<i>Look, I'm here, ain't I?</i>

<i>...spending the rest of your life
in a Florida prison over this?</i>

<i>There ain't gonna be any body.</i>

The mayor's office just called.

You're being named
Businessman of the Year.

Plaque's coming later,
along with the photo op.

All right.
So get ready.

Thanks.

Any word on Danny yet?
No.

You want I should go look for him?

No, that's all right.

I was just a little hot
last night, that's all.

Yeah? It's probably a good thing
he got away, then.

Yeah.

Kick this door down!

Double-time! Move!

Get the door!

<i>Chris Troiano,
this is the Miami police!</i>

<i>- we have a warrant for your arrest!
It's the cops!</i>

Go, go, go!

Come on, let's go!

Stay with Andy!
what the hell's going on?

Everybody on the floor!
Get down! Get down!

Put your hands on the rail.
Put your hands on the rail.

Cuff him!

Get off me!

He's a cop. I said he's a cop.
He's on the job.

Now let him up.
Andy!

I read you. Continue pursuit.

Spread your feet.
I'm clean.

I said I'm clean.

She is.

He was your friend, Andy.
How the hell could you hurt him?

Hey, you knew
he was dirty all along.

You just be glad the Feds
aren't bringing you down too.

So, we gonna get Allie Boy out of this?

When Allie Boy was released
a few years ago,

he was not allowed to carry weapons.

<i>Go check out his boat.</i>

<i>This is the FBI. we have a warrant.</i>

You gotta be kiddin' me.

<i>Anyone below deck
come up on top...</i>

<i>He keeps a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun
above the cabin door of his boat.</i>

<i>He's gonna say it's not his
and the captain uses it against pirates.</i>

<i>It's enough to hold him
until we get Troiano to cooperate</i>

<i>and the other charges fall into place.</i>

He's southbound on Fifth!

Put your hands in the air!

Hands in the air!

<i>All the guys on your old crew,
they're turning...</i>

He's giving Glaser nothing.
I'm not surprised.

<i>You better understand one thing...
Liquid is finished.</i>

<i>- You are finished.
He's not gonna talk to him.</i>

Then can you do something?

<i>You think that's funny, huh?</i>

<i>You better talk to me, pal.</i>

<i>In ten minutes, that's it.
Now, how does...</i>

...Allie Boy connect to the money
you run through the club?

How ya doin', Chris?

That what you'd normally wear?

Sometimes.

Burnett. That really your name?

Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

Troiano's not your last name.

It's wentz, right?

That's my mother's maiden name.
They're both my names.

Let me ask you a question.
why? why me?

You spend all this time with me
to bust my balls?

You know I'm not
the worst piece of shit out there.

Why you pricks pick me?
It's pretty simple, Chris.

You're a street kid from Bath Beach.
So what?

You're gonna come down here
and become the biggest thing

on South Beach and nobody's
gonna suspect nothin'?

where you gonna get
that kind of cash?

You had to be a front for somebody.
I saved my pennies.

We opened the case
so we could find out

Where those pennies came from.

And you found out that I wasn't
a front for anybody but myself.

Yeah.

I actually told my bosses that
for a long time.

I told 'em so many times
they thought I was going native.

Maybe you should have
so you could hold your head up

instead of running around
like a little rat.

Then we'd both be sitting here
facing life without parole.

I think even you're gonna
agree that it's a good thing

to have a friend
on this side of the table.

A friend? You're not my friend.
This is bullshit.

You got nothin'.
I got nothin'?

I got you taking me on Allie Boy's boat.

I got you on tape taking me
to Danny Hayes's house

to whack him out, which is
conspiracy to commit murder.

You want more?
You don't got me on tape.

I checked you.

Chris... I got you on tape.

I haven't done anything.
I opened my own joint.

You opened your own joint

with the money from
the Petrov robbery, didn't you?

See, I figure Allie Boy
put you in on that score.

Slava Petrov's a bank
for the Russian mob.

You take him down,
you get your wad of cash.

You take that cash,
you open up Risk.

Then Allie Boy torches the joint for you,
and boom! Liquid is born.

But there's a problem
with that, isn't there?

You got a real problem, 'cause now
Allie Boy has got you into him

for always and forever.

Maybe he squeezes you sometimes,

busts your balls
with his Cuban goons.

Maybe he even asks you
to do his laundry.

Oh, come on! This is a joke!

This is a joke!
You can't prove anything!

Chris...

Davey Harris rolled.

All right?

He put you in on that
push-in homicide in New York.

He's a liar. I didn't kill anybody.

He never said you did.

Go, go, go!

<i>But he put you at the wheel.</i>

He put you at the wheel,
and in a robbery-homicide

that's as good as
pulling the trigger yourself.

Only you can help you now, Chris.

Oh, okay.
Now I'm supposed to flip?

That what you want?

It's your only chance.

I think you know me
better than that.

Who do you think
they're gonna believe...

a scumbag like Davey Harris,
or Businessman of the Year?

I'll take my chances.
what about Allie Boy?

You gonna take your chances with him?

Think about it, Chris.

Allie Boy has killed some
of his oldest and closest friends

just on the chance
that they might betray him.

What possible chance do you have?

You plead, he can't be sure
you won't change your mind

after a few years...
plenty of guys do.

You plead not guilty,
he knows the prosecutor's

gonna drag him
into the middle of that case,

Which is good enough
to get you whacked.

And if you should beat the case...
which you won't...

he's gonna whack you
for being dumb enough

to bring a cop
onto his boat in the first place!

Allie Boy's straight.
Yeah?

He's straight, huh?

Let me tell you something, Chris.

To Allie Boy and his goons,

you are a punch line to a joke
that they're gonna tell over drinks.

You're the sucker that they
squeezed dry and let take the fall,

because that's
what suckers are good for.

They're the reason
that you're here right now.

If you go in the can for this,
they're gonna laugh about it

and hump all those pretty little
girlfriends of yours at the same time.

You're a good salesman, Andy.

I ain't sellin', Chris.

I'm offering you help
from this side of the table.

I still ain't buyin'.

Fine.

I really hate to see them guys
make a sucker out of you.

Well, you did sell it well.

I wasn't selling.

Just told him the way it is.
Let me know what he decides.
