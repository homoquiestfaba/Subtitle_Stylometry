Do I have other things more important 
to worry about now, ok?

What do you think about this, kitten?

Very cute. What do you think?

Ah, nice.

Disgusting.

For a secondary school.

Who would suspect of a secondary 
school?

It is perfect.

Just get the photos.

Do you have them?

2,000 a week, medical assistance, and 
participation of the profits.

Starts Monday.

Perfect.

I already have enough with students 
having sex like rabbits.

I don't need the teachers to get 
worse.

If.

Well, in truth, I think that you have 
something of reason, Lyle.

I don't see another alternative so I 
have to resign.

This is my letter of resignation, 
effective as of today.

I'm sorry, I'm late for my history 
class.

Are you joking, not?

No. Not, it is.

Then, the bombing campaign aeros of 
the united States,

<-O->Well, guys, silence. Do you 
Mick?

What is the goal? Who fucking cares 
the story to the end?

<-O -> what There is, See? <-O->
The reason is this.

Not interested in who has more bombs 
or soldiers.

What if? Only not to become pregnant.

You're a good teacher, Sam.

The kind of teacher that we can't 
afford to lose.

Come on, Lyle, we're not teaching you 
anything.

This is not a school, it is a prison.

Just stop these guys until they are

old enough to graduate

with diplomas that can't read.

It is my last day.

Agree.

The breast of Macer is in the 
hospital.

I need someone to take care of the 
kind of penance.

What?

What are you going to do to become 
after time?

Well, don't think of this as a 
punishment.

Veil more as a... a gesture of 
farewell.

You son of a bitch!

<-O -> it Ends with that! <-O->
Leave It, Jay Tee.

Well. Come on, enough is enough. Hey.

Is enough.

The idiot threatened to kill me. You 
can expel them by that.

<-O -> What? <-O->Let.

<-O->The punishment should be 
enough. <-O -> For what?

You can't fix it. Oi out there that 
you are criticizing Alicia.

What happened? Does the alcohol was 
very good and fell?

<-O -> What? <-O->enough is 
enough. I said enough is enough.

Go to the showers. Hey! We will, to 
the showers.

with me?

Perhaps in another life.

But by how much? That entirely 
depends on you.

So, what happened, Sammy? Do you want

sinner.

Some beautiful present of farewell.

Do you want to or not? Of course, we 
want.

Then...

Here are some incentive.

We will return to the revolver,

a sound... With a bullet, so to speak.
