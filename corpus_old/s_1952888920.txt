â™ª Dreaming

â™ª Into oblivion

â™ª You're not the only one

â™ª Livin' like this

â™ª Did you notice?

â™ª Now it's hopeless...

Shane.

Go for Shane.

We need you upstairs for a credit check.

I'm on my way.

â™ª I'm afraid of

â™ª Who I've become...

Hard play's over this way, baby.

â™ª I'm too late to say

â™ª What I've done

â™ª Yeah

â™ª Push it

â™ª So that I will break...

Hey, baby.
â™ª Make another mistake

â™ª Blow me away

â™ª Did you say you were afraid?

â™ª 'Cause it's so damn easy

â™ª I'm afraid of who I've become

â™ª Yeah

â™ª I don't even know my name...
Yes!

â™ª I don't even feel the same

â™ª Yeah.

Which guy is it?

The guy who keeps counting his chips?

What's he into us for?
At least 10,000.

What's the marker?
He wants another five.

All right, I'll sign for it,
but keep him playing.

Ray, they're asking for you at the door.

Yeah? And who is "they"?

Walter left a while ago.

Said he was going out for a smoke

and didn't come back.
And they sent you to tell me?

It's not like that, Ray.

No? How is it then?

I just wanted you to know.

Yeah, well, thanks for that.

â™ª Feel the same

â™ª Maybe I should give a damn

â™ª But I don't know who I am.

â™ª She got legs

â™ª She got moves, look at her move

â™ª And everywhere she go,
she's gotta use 'em

â™ª She got legs

â™ª She got moves

â™ª And everywhere she go,
she gotta use 'em

â™ª Hey, petite girl, what's your name?

â™ª I'm big heat, I play no games

â™ª Yo, legs girl like something sweet

â™ª Good enough for me,
then you're good enough to eat...

Hey, man, I can't find Walter.

Can you check and see if he's outside?
Yeah.

â™ª I make her body quake
for the moon display

â™ª No, stop, heels is necessary...
Whoo!

â™ª There's another way
and she ain't scary

â™ª People smiling like Tyler Perry...

Johnny.
Yeah?

Give me a whiskey, neat, please.
You got it, Ray.

â™ª She got legs, she got moves...

There you go, buddy.
Thank you.

â™ª And everywhere she go
she gotta use 'em

â™ª She got legs

â™ª She got moves

â™ª And everywhere she go,
she gotta use 'em

â™ª She's fire
â™ª Sophisticated showstopper

â™ª She's so smart, man, it ain't proper

â™ª I play dada, you play mama

â™ª She Mary J, she don't want no drama

â™ª Like a D.J. I move the room

â™ª Soon as I step in I groove them

â™ª I'm King Tut, I'll take you to my tomb

â™ª Come on, Nefertiti...

There you go.

Thank you.
Thanks.

Thanks for taking over, Pete.

Oh, no problem.

Heard we needed someone at the door,
so I came down.

Seen Walter yet?

No. Been out here for 10 minutes.

Gentlemen.
My food's getting cold.

Why don't you go inside?
I got it 'til Walter comes back.

Okay. Do you want anything?

My dad owns the place, I get comped.

No, kid, I'm good.
Can you grab my coat for me, though?

It's behind the bar.
Yeah, sure.

It's cold out here.
Thanks, kid, I owe you.

You don't owe me anything.
Besides my dad,

you're the only person
that's nice to me around here.

I feel you, kid.

Hi, Mrs. Zello.

You work here, don't you?
That I do.

It's the blue Z4.

No thanks. Got my own ride.

Do you know who I am?

Do I care?

My husband signs your paychecks.

Last I checked I was
on Vinnie's payroll.

Look, I have something important
that I'm late for,

so if you don't mind--

I don't mind at all.

Prick.

Hey, man, you got to
take that down the street.

I can't have you doing that out here.

It's a classy place, bro. Come on, man.

Don't move, motherfucker.
Turn the fuck around.

Take it easy. Take it easy.
Turn around. Turn around.

Go go. Move move.

Get in there. Let's go. Hurry.
Move. Move Move.

It's all good. Just take it easy.

Inside now! Go. Move.

Hands down, keep your mouth shut.

Do you know who owns this fucking place?

Shut your fucking mouth
or I'll end you right now.

Keep moving. Shut the fuck up.

Come on.

Let's go, guys. Keep it calm.

Get her to open the cage.

Open the cage.

Oh, yeah, sure. Is everything okay?

Yeah. Just open the cage.

Get in there! Now! On the floor now!

Let's go.
Stay down. Don't move.

Stay calm and nobody's gonna get hurt.

Shut up!

Get the goddamn money now! Move.

Shut up.
Stay calm.

Just stay calm
and nobody's gonna get hurt.

Get the fuckin' money now!
Hurry up! Come on.

Hurry up. Let's go.

All right, big fella, let's go. Come on.

You're gonna take us
right through the front door.

Hurry. Quick quick quick.

Open the door, big man.

Excuse me.

Just be cool.
Hey, Ray, I got your coat.

It's okay, Pete, it's okay.

He's got a gun!
No!

Everyone get down!

Pete? Pete!

Pete? Pete?

Oh, man.

Lock it down.

Okay.

What the fuck, Ray?

You just laid there
like a fucking punk bitch?

That how you acted when
you were in the joint? Hmm?

You take it in the ass?
I locked it down.

What'd you say?
I followed the protocols you set up.

If I had gone after those guys,
who would have watched the club?

Say it again.
Fuck.

You want every cop in this town

to walk through an illegal casino?

You want them to find all the Johns
upstairs getting their dicks sucked?

If it wasn't for me
we'd all be going to jail.

Are you fuckin' kidding me?

Half the department's on the payroll.

You fuckin' believe this guy?

Clean yourself up.

I don't know, man.
I never saw their faces.

Ray Shane.

Detective Landry.
I heard that you got out.

About six months ago.
What's Internal Affairs doing here?

Oh, I transferred back to Homicide.

Is that right?
Yeah.

Yeah. Tired of putting
real cops in jail?

Hey, Slattery, I don't know
how long you've been on the force,

but Shane here used to be a cop.

It was Vice, wasn't it?

Back in the day.

And now you're running security
for the Marcella brothers.

I mean, ain't it funny
how things come around?

And by the way,
you're doing a great job too.

I hope that dead kid
wasn't a friend of yours.

What do you want, Landry?

I want the keys to the Kingdom, Shane.

So why don't you personally escort us

up to the second and third floor.

You know what I'm talking about.

Come on. Finish that cigarette.

Whatever you say, Detective.
Good. Let's go.

A little slower after that stint, huh?

You're movin' old.

Dirt all on your back. Come on.

You know, big guy, I've been
waiting for this for a long time.

Yeah, I bet you have.

How long were you in there for?
Was it about five?

Yeah, something like that.

Must have been hard for a dirty cop
in there with all them bubbas.

No, it was all right.

I had your dad to keep me company.

You'll want to learn to shut your mouth.

Because if you say anything
about my dad again,

I'll kill you.

Hey, Landry.
Yeah, Shane?

I heard your dad gives
a helluva blow job.

No.
Whoa whoa. Not now.

Take it easy, partner.
Ray, this isn't over.

Whatever, tough guy.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

I heard you got into it with Tony.

Yeah, well, luckily your boyfriend

doesn't throw much of a punch.

Tony's not my boyfriend.
That's not what I heard.

Why do you say things like that?

Does it make you feel good
to act like an asshole?

Who says I'm acting?

I know you, Ray.
Not anymore, you don't.

So why don't you go back upstairs
with the rest of the whores?

Dick.

Yeah?
Why did you say that to me?

What?

Why do you like hurting me so much?

It doesn't have to be like this.

How do you think I feel
about what you did to me?

Tony? Is that what we're talking about?

Okay, I was with him
because you weren't there.

I was in prison.
Exactly.

Look, every time I try to talk to you,

you just walk away.

Well, then maybe
you should get the hint.

You know what,
will you just give me five minutes?

Just time to explain myself?

I mean it was a mistake.
It should have never happened.

You're goddamn right.

Look, I got to go to work.

Me too.

Yeah, but you get to lie down
on the job all day, don't you?

Fuck you, Ray.

Look, I really really
don't have time for this.

Shane, shut the fuck up.
Vincent's in his office.

Get yourself down here.

You're late. They started
the meeting without you.

Yeah, well, I got here
as fast as I could.

We had everything under control.

How could you let this happen?

It had nothin' to do with me.

You let this bum take care of shit.

He practically walked them
through the front door.

That's not the way it went down.

This guy you vouched for, Walter,

he left his post a minute
before that crew hit our door.

What's that have to do with anything?
He's your guy.

When was the last time
you talked to him?

We been looking everywhere.
We can't fucking find him!

That don't mean shit.
His son's dead because of you.

Enough! Do you know who this is?

Carlos sent him down. Charlie's here
to make sure you don't screw this up.

Do I get a chance to tell my side?

Can't wait to fuckin' hear this.

I'm sorry about Pete.
He was a great kid.

But I did everything
I could to keep things under control.

So you ordered the lock down?

Yeah, I did.

Well, I think that was a good move.

You protected the family
and our interests.

Fuck that. He should have been
stopping those guys

from taking over 300 grand of our money.

Why were we carrying that much cash?

Money's not the issue.
I want you to find them.

I want this handled internally.

Mr. Marcella, I can't do that.
You were a detective.

You're used to finding people
that don't want to be found.

But with all due respect,

to work like a cop
you need access to information--

ballistics, criminal histories,
I can't get any of that.

Use your contacts in the department.
Use ours for that matter.

If I show up at the precinct,

I'm gonna be as welcome
as the clap in a convent.

Fuck it. I'll handle it.

No.

Blood demands blood.

You find the men who murdered my son

and bring them to me.

Can I get another Crown?
Make that two.

You played it smart in there,

not letting that prick,
Tony, get to you.

You keeping tabs on me, Charlie?

That's what they pay me for.

There you go, gentlemen.

So where'd you do your time?

Terre Haute.

How was it?

Colder than this shit.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

I did three years State time,
nearly nine Federal.

Nine years, man, I would have lost it.

You know the best way
to do a long stretch?

Yeah.

Day by motherfucking day.

I can't ever go back.

Is that what you're afraid of?

I got a dozen guys out there

just waiting for me to fuck up
so they can send me back.

Vinnie's not asking you
to step over the line,

just play it close that's all.

I don't know, man.

All right, listen to me.
Don't let Tony get to you.

He's trying way too hard
just to look the part.

Yeah. Prick's trying
to lay this shit on me.

Because we've never been hit before.

Just trying to cover his own ass.

What about you?

Well, they keep me around just
to eliminate problems for the old man.

Am I one of those problems?

Not yet.

I wouldn't even know where to begin.

Sometimes you got to
think about what you saw

and then ask yourself that question--

"What was out of place
when it all went down?"

Listen, I've got to go.

But if you need to find me,

this is where I am most afternoons,

where I go to clear my head.

You be lucky.

Hey, it's Walter.

Leave your digits
and maybe I'll get back to you.

Can I do something for you?

Yeah. I'm looking for a buddy of mine,

been staying here a month
or two since he got out.

His name's Walter Randall. You seen him?

Not in a couple of days.

Thanks anyway.
You know, you ain't the first guy

that stopped by here looking for him.

Is that right? You mind
if I check his room?

Are you a cop?
No.

Then, yeah, I do.

All right.

Hey, you find him,
tell him he's late on his rent.

It's due every Friday.

If he doesn't come back here
and pay up in full

in the next couple of days,
I'm throwing his shit out.

Yeah, I'll do that.

Hey, man. How much you got?

Excuse me?
I overheard you, what you were saying.

What's that got to do with you?
Look...

I know where your boy's staying, okay?

I'll tell you.
I just need a little cash, man, okay?

All right.

If he's not where you say he is,

I'm coming back for this.
Okay, man, look,

he's at the this little
piece of shit motel.

It's off the Interstate.
It's... Lazy T. Lazy T.

We-- you know, we got some H there,

we partied it up, man.
It's all good. I promise.

You know the room?

25, okay? 25.

Hey hey, man, you see him,

tell him I've got some
really good shit, okay?

Thanks, man.

â™ª This feels like a dream

â™ª Grabs at someone unseen

â™ª And I'm waiting

â™ª And I'm waiting for the world

â™ª I look but I can't see

â™ª What's inside of me

â™ª And I'm still

â™ª Waiting on the world.

Walter.

Walter, it's Ray.

Walt?

Fuck.

Jimmy.

Jimmy.
What are you doing here, Ray?

I need your help, man.

I can't be seen with you.

Give me a call sometime.
Maybe we can talk.

I called you three times.
I've been busy.

Hey.

We were partners.

It's ancient history.

You think you'd still be on the job
if I hadn't stood up for you?

They wanted the whole squad--

Internal Affairs,

U.S. Attorney's office, goddamn FBI.

They all tried to make deals with me.

They offered me a walk if I testified.

Look, I appreciate
what you did, all right,

but I can't do this with you.
Five fucking years, Jimmy.

You know how long that is?

Well, I'm into something
and I need your help.

You owe me that much.
All right.

Let's go talk over there.

I got a wife and a new baby girl.

I can't do this shit anymore.

I don't want to see
pictures of your family.

They're the only reason
I'm still riding the desk.

You know,
Landry came down the other day,

said you were working over at the House.

Yeah, that's right.
Listen,

y'all got some shit brewing down there.

I don't want any part of it.

Hey, you've got access
to everything I need:

interviews, witness statements,
the whole case file.

I need you to show it to me.

I can't do that! If I get caught I'm g--

You weren't so worried about
getting caught back in the old days

when you were shoving
Vinnie's envelopes in your pocket.

Keep your goddamn voice down.
Have you seen the reports?

Yeah, I've seen them.

Is there anything in there I can use?

Goddamn you, Ray.

The lab matched the slugs
from the shooter's gun

to a bullet they dug out
of a murder victim about a month ago.

What good does that do me?

Homicide brought in a suspect,

they couldn't find a weapon,
they had to let him loose.

Get me the file.

Why are you helping the Marcellas?

Do you think I have a choice?
Get me the file.

Who is it?
Cleo Harris?

What the fuck you want?
Cleo Harris?

I said what the fuck do you want?

I need to ask you a few questions.

You got a search warrant?
No. No.

Look, I just want to
ask you a few questions.

What the fuck you doing
in my goddamn house?!

You broke my fucking door!

I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

You ain't got no search warrant.
I'm not a cop.

Oh, you're not a cop?
No. I just need to ask you a few--

Fuck yeah, motherfucker!

Yeah, you broke into
the wrong house today.

Fuck is wrong with you,
breaking into my house?

Broke into my motherfuckin' house.

Yeah, motherfucker. Yeah, that's right.

Yeah, getting dirty.

I work for the Marcellas.
So what? Get off me.

Someone robbed their place
and used your gun

to kill the owner's son.
I heard about what happened.

I had nothing to do with it.
You were picked up

on a murder charge two weeks ago.

That charge's been dropped.
Well, what did you do with the gun?

A motherfucker named
Scooby got that gun.

White guy or black guy?
White boy, buys coke from me.

He came over here about a month ago,
said he needed a piece.

Where's he live?
Man, I ain't no motherfuckin' snitch.

You're gonna tell me where he lives!

You're gonna tell me where he lives

or I'm gonna go back to the Marcellas

and tell them that you were
involved in the robbery.

And you know what that means?

They're gonna come looking for you!

So you're gonna tell me where he lives.

A'ight.

Shit.

Let's go.

Big fucker, let's go.

That's it right there,

707, second door. 707.

Which car is his?
I showed you where he live.

That's it. I'm done.

You tell the Marcellas
I had nothing to do with it.

What?
You tell anybody about me,

I'm gonna make sure everybody
knows you ratted your boy out.

Let go.

Who are you?

I'm a friend of Scooby's.

You look like a cop.

Yeah, I hear that
all the time. Is he home?

Scooby ain't here. He's dead.

Last night he was standing on the street

waiting for a ride
and somebody shot him.

Hello.
Jimmy, it's Ray.

You're calling me at home?
My family's here with me.

Yeah, well, good for them.
What do you want?

I need you to pull a rap sheet for me

on a guy named Lawrence Salazar.

It's a little late for that.
I can do it in the morning.

I need it now.

Meet me in the motor pool
basement in an hour.

Jimmy.
God damn it.

You scared the fucking shit out of me.

Did you get it?
Yeah, I got it.

This is it though, Ray. I mean it.

Don't ask me for anything else.

Salazar runs a pretty tight crew.

Their sheets are a mile long.

One of his buddies has a spider tattoo.

A lot of guys in this town have them.

I busted this guy-- Dylan Sylvester.

You know him?

It looks like Fritz and I picked
him up nine years ago.

Son of a bitch.

We popped Salazar
two years later on a dope charge.

Kind of strange, huh,
you knowing the guys

that tried to put a bullet in your head?

Hey, you gonna tell the greasers that
you know two of the hold-up men?

It's not like we were drinking buddies.

Why don't you tell them about it then?

That's what I thought.

I'm out of this, Ray. I mean it.

Don't call me again.

How old is your daughter?
Why?

You want her to grow up
without a father?

You're threatening me?
Remember the old days, Jimmy?

Well, I'm deep into this
and the statute of limitations

on the shit we did hasn't run out.

If I go down, I'm taking you with me!

Fuck you, asshole!

It's been a long time, Detective.

Yes, it has.

You got 60 seconds.

I want Ray Shane off my back.

Too fuckin' bad for you.

I know you got Shane out
looking for the guys

that took you off the other night.

As far as I know,
the police are investigating that.

Stop pulling my dick, Tony.

You know Ray knows two of the shooters?

One of them's dead

and he's out looking for the others.

Is that right?

And your doorman, Walter,

he was found with his throat slit
in a motel on Division.

The maid spotted someone
leaving that very room

that matched
the description of Ray Shane.

Who else knows about this?

I want Ray Shane out of my life.

Look, I know how badly
your business was impacted

by this unfortunate event.

Shut down your brothel
and casino for how many nights now?

What'd that cost you?

I expect that this will be
filled by next time we meet.

You trust this cop?

He rode Vice with Shane.
He knows how he thinks.

So why's he telling us?
He needs the cash.

Figures if he sells us intel,
he can get back on the payroll.

If Shane set this up, why's he got
to lean on his old partner for help?

He's just tying up loose ends.

Listen, if we don't jump into this now,

we're gonna have no one left
to connect him to the robbery.

I brought that man into this House.

I took him when no one else would.

I trusted him.
We all did.

Bring him in.

How you doing, Ray?
What the fuck do you want?

Vincent wants to know
why you took our money

and why you killed his son.

What the fuck are you talking about?

Killing Pete was stupid.

Taking the money--
what the fuck were you thinking?

I didn't have anything to do with it,
and you fucking know it!

That's what I thought you'd say.

Fuck you. It wasn't me.

Bullshit. I didn't have
anything to do with it.

I know you know who the shooters are!

I was a cop! That connects me
to every scumbag in the city.

I knew you were a piece of shit

the second Vincent brought you in.

Once a dirty cop always a dirty cop.

Always looking out for number one, hmm?

Right or left, Ray.
What?

Your call.

Jenny.

Jesus, Ray. What are you doing here?

Can we go inside?

God, you look like
you got hit by a truck.

Yeah? Well, that's 'cause
your boyfriend decided

to use me as a punching bag.
You know what?

If you're gonna talk to me like that,
you can leave right now!

I'm sorry.
Stay right there.

Well, this place sure has changed.

Yeah well, it's mine now.

I didn't really like your furnishings
anyway. Here, try that.

Want a beer?

Yeah.
Oh God.

There you go.

So what happened, Ray?

Huh?
Vinnie thinks I set up the robbery.

He sent Tony and Joey
to work me over.

Did you?
Did I what, set up the robbery?

Yeah. Did you?
Are you fucking kidding me?

No.
How can you even ask me that?

You were there. You know what happened.

This is crazy. It doesn't make sense.

It's too connected.

You know what? You just need to get

as far away from here as you can.

But where am I gonna go? I'll be the
prime suspect in at least two murders.

And if I leave now, I'll spend the rest
of my life looking over my shoulder.

So if you stay, they'll kill you.

I did my time. I can't live like that.

You're smart. You're really smart.
I'm not running.

Who is it?
It's Tony. Open the door.

Shit.

Hold on.

Goddamn it.

Be there in a minute.
Let me put something on.

Open the fuckin' door!

What do you want, Tony?
Let me inside.

Take the chain off.

No. The last time I did,

you just fucked a lot of shit up.

Take the chain off.
What do you want?

I want to talk to you.
Do you?

Yeah.
Okay.

Say what you have to say right there.

Don't get smart. Just let me in.
Hey!

Let me inside.

You seen Shane?

No, I haven't seen him.

You think he would come here? Huh!

Let me inside.
Don't!

No. Do you want me to call the cops?

I'll call the cops.
Here. You want it, huh?

You ready?
Fuck you. I'll deal with you later.

Oh, big shot, big shot.
Fucking piece of shit.

Thanks, Ray. Thanks a lot.

God damn it.

There you go.
I can't believe you kept this.

Goodwill wouldn't take it.

Besides, I used it to wash my car.

Do you ever wonder where we'd be

if we hadn't messed up
our lives so badly?

Yeah, every day.

Did you mean what you said earlier

about not running away this time?

What else can I do?

You can be honest with yourself.

Just admit that you are who you are

because of all the choices you've made.

Practically the minute
I got my prison sentence

you went back to being a hooker.

I wasn't a hooker. I was a call girl.

And I stopped

when you got out
because of you, lunkhead.

Besides, you were a crooked cop.

You got paid to look the other way,

and that was the choice you made.

Those are the choices I made.

And, basically,

that was how
we got ourselves in this mess.

Heya.
New wheels?

Yeah, something like that.

I heard you got yourself
into a bit of a jam.

Yeah, it's become a habit.

Yeah, well,
you don't know the half of it.

Ray, Ray, Ray, relax. Sit down.

I'm not here to whack you.

Well, not yet anyway.

Doesn't sound very reassuring.

But just so you know,
if the old man gets involved

there's nothing I can do.

I need your help, Charlie.

Look, Ray, I like you.

So please do me a favor--
you did not hear this from me.

Tony Zello's been playing
the back channels.

He wants Vinnie out of the way and
he's gonna use the robbery to do it.

How?

Well, Vinnie put you in charge of
security. That used to be Tony's job.

And if it looks like you set up
the robbery, well then--

Vinnie's out and Tony takes over.

Yeah.

All I'm saying to you is
don't underestimate Tony.

He would do whatever it takes
to get what he wants,

including pimping his wife out.

Yeah.

Every Wednesday night

she meets the old man

after hours and they go out

to his estate on Reeds Lake.

Why is Carlos messing around with her?

Well, she's young and she's
good looking, isn't she?

You know, as long as Priscilla
takes care of him,

then the old man's
gonna watch Tony's back.

You think he'd listen to me
if I went to him in person?

He's a reasonable man.

But to be honest with you,
it's gonna be like--

it's gonna be like going to court.

You're gonna have to
make a really good case.

And the best way to do that

is to prove to him
who really set this up.

I'm telling you,
if you can find the cash

and you can find the shooter,

well, then the rest
will fall into place.

I'll see you around.

Who is it?
Maintenance.

What do you want?

One of your neighbors
smacked into your car.

I don't have time to fuck around.

You got one chance
to answer my questions.

Fuck you!

In a minute you're gonna
feel some real pain.

Who else was a part of your crew?

I don't know what you're talking about.

Next time you lie to me

I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.

I'm the only one left.
Where are the others?

Dead.
What were their names?

One guy was named Eddie Teasedale.

The other guy we called Wop.

Scooby said he had a man on the inside.

It was supposed to be an easy score.
Shit was all arranged, man.

All we had to do was just come
and make it look real.

What happened to 'em?
They set up a meet for us

to drop off the cash.
When we got there all hell broke loose.

Who was it?

I didn't see any faces.

It was too dark.
You're going back with me.

I ain't talking to no cops!

You got a lot of nerve
interrupting my dinner.

It's business.

Why don't you two go
and powder your noses?

I don't need to powder my nose.

Go take a piss, get a drink,
whatever. Give us a minute.

Sit down.

Now what's so fucking important?

Some guy called me today,

said he saw Shane and Charlie Blackstone
talking at 4th Street Park.

Who made the call?

Just some guy who's
into me for a thousand.

Charlie's worked for me for a long time.

He got no business talking to Shane.

What do you want me to do?

Listen, I got to head out
for a little bit.

I won't be too long.

You ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

So where's your other guy, Joey?

He's just taking care
of some shit. Let's go.

I thought you said
that guy's supposed to be here.

That's what they told me.

Who's "they"?
Fuck, does it matter?

This kid has information on Shane.

Here's the guy now.

I trusted you, Charlie.

Considered you a stand-up guy.

No!

You been seeing Shane behind our backs.

That's fucking bullshit and you know it.

Charlie, quiet.
No one can fucking hear you out here.

.22 caliber, hurts like a bitch.

I once saw a guy take 11 rounds

before he begged me to kill him.

You tell me where he is,
I'll make it quick,

I promise.

You can do whatever you fucking want,

because I got nothing to give up.

Joey, how do you feel
about fucking this man's wife?

Fuck you!

Tell me where he is!

Tell me where he is.
You've just got to be patient,

because he's coming for you.., soon!

Clean that shit up.

Yeah, give me Detective Lagrange,
Jimmy Lagrange.

It's Ray Shane. Trust me,
he'll know who it is.

Where are you, Ray?

Jimmy, I'm in big trouble, man.

You got to meet me down at Fairfax--

You got some fucking balls,
calling me after what you did.

What are you talking about?

Yeah, we're all here
looking at your handiwork

over at Charlie Blackstone's.

Did you have to kill
the wife, Ray? Seriously?

Holy shit.
Was she getting in your way too?

You got to believe me.

Jimmy, I didn't have
anything to do with that.

I swear, man, I didn't have
anything to do with that.

Well, ain't that interesting, 'cause we
got an eyewitness who called in,

says he saw you
with Blackstone earlier today.

And we got your
blood-stained pocket knife

laying right beside the old lady.

Jimmy, this ain't right, man.

Someone's-- this ain't right.

Jimmy, is that him?
Yeah, its him.

He called in from a payphone.
Give me the phone. Now!

We got a trace on it.

Keep him talking.
I got it. I got it.

Ray?
Don't believe any of this shit.

You listen to me.

I'm gonna give you one chance, okay?

If you don't come in right now,

there is gonna be nothing
that is gonna get in my way

from personally strapping you
to the electric chair.

Do you hear me?
Fuck.

Ray?

Find him!

Oh no.

Hello?

Jenny, you got to get out
of your apartment now!

What? Ray, what are you talking about?

Just get out now!
Leave everything! Just go!

Meet me at the Riley in 10 minutes.

Just get out now! Go!

You've gotta fill me in, Ray.

What's happened? What's going on?

I found one of the shooters.

A guy named Dylan Sylvester.

He told me that someone
from inside the House

set up the robbery.
Who?

He didn't know.
There were four guys there, right?

Dead, they're all dead. He said
they showed up to exchange the cash

and somebody opened fire on 'em.
He's the only one that got away.

Okay, so where is he now?

Can't you go to the cops?

I tried. I tried.

Everything's leading back to me.

What about Charlie?

Doesn't he have an in with Carlos?

Charlie's wife was murdered tonight.

He's probably not far behind.

Charlie told me the only way

to clear my name
with Vinnie and the old man

was to get the cash and the shooters,

and the shooters are all dead.

I got to find that money.

Fuck.

What?

I ordered you a whiskey, neat.

Hmm. I gotta say,

I was surprised to hear from you.

A girl can change her mind, can't she?

Where you been?

You haven't been at work in days.

I quit.

Decided it was time
to move on to something new.

Is that right?

Maybe I can help you.
Maybe you can.

Hmm.

Coffee.

You still looking for Ray?

What do you know about it?

I know he fucked me over
like he did you.

I don't owe him a goddamn thing,

but in 15 minutes my phone is gonna ring

and my friend on the other line

is gonna tell me exactly where he is.

Who's this friend of yours?

She's a nurse.

Apparently you
roughed him up pretty hard

the other night 'cause she patched him.

Supposed to drop off
painkillers sometime

later this afternoon.

Where?

What's it worth to you?

You got my attention.

This is a waste of my fuckin' time.

Call me after you speak to your friend.

I still haven't heard a price.

2500, if it's legit.

Let's make it an even five
and you have a deal.

Hmm. For 5,000,

you gotta put something
sweet into the pot.

2500 it is.

Huh.

Rachel?

Jenny, Tony's in on it.

You got to get out of there now.

Really? What time?

I've got take a chance

and go to Carlos.

Yeah. You did good.

What she say?

Where's my money?

â™ª Caught in the thick of it

â™ª Eye in the pyramid

â™ª Force fed and sick of it

â™ª Caught in the thick of it

â™ª Eye in the pyramid

â™ª Force fed and sick of it

â™ª Yes, they're making lists

â™ª Are you interested?

Oh.

Ooh damn.

Ah!
What the fuck?

No. No. No.

No, I'm not here to hurt anyone.

I'm not here to hurt anyone, all right?

I just need you to listen to me, okay?

I just want to talk.
I just want to talk.

Just hear me out.
What are you doing?

The man's got a gun, wants to talk.

I suggest we listen.

Everybody just be cool.
Just hear me out.

You pull a gun on me, kid,

you better have something
motherfucking important to say.

All right. All right.

All right. Look at that.

Open that up.

What's this?

It belongs to her husband.

He smokes. So do I.
So do you. So fuckin' what?

No, the Lazy T Motel, room 25.

I found that in Tony's car today.

That's where him and his boys killed
Walter and left him for the police.

He was the missing doorman
at the House the night it got robbed.

And you can prove this?
No, not yet.

Look, I know what you've been told

and, believe me,
the last place that anybody

who had anything to do
with this robbery would want to be

is right here, standing in front of you.

I can't believe you're
taking this shit seriously.

Dylan Sylvester was one of the shooters.

He told me it was an inside job.

Somebody from inside
the House set up the robbery.

Yeah, it was you, you son of a bitch!
Shut the fuck up. Go on.

I don't wanna spend
the rest of my life looking

over my shoulder, Mr. Marcella.
A lot of guys would have.

Maybe if they had an extra 300 grand

in their pocket, but I don't.

Charlie told me that her husband

was pimpin' her out to you.
That way you'd be distracted

while he tried
to take over Vinnie's spot.

You shut the fuck up!
Well, you tell me,

who authorized us to carry

300 grand the night we got hit?

Vinnie said it was Tony's idea.

Think about it. Think about it, Carlos.

I was head of security and I had
no idea we had that much cash on hand.

If I'd known, I'd have had security
all over that place.

You're a fuckin' liar!
You search their houses, their cars.

I'd bet my life that you find that cash

or at least something else that
proves that they did it.

No! No!

911 . What is your emergency?

Yeah.

I was out walking my dog
and I heard gunshots.

Where are you calling from, sir?

Interstate 96.

The Marcella house on Reeds Lake.

Sir, may I please have your name?

Hello.
Meet me at the House, Jimmy.

Ray, I told you I don't wanna be
involved in this.

Carlos is dead.
You'd better meet me now.

â™ª Oh my God, please tell me

â™ª What you see

â™ª Losing patience

â™ª Too helplessly

â™ª Can you tell me

â™ª Where I went wrong?

â™ª I can't help myself

â™ª I'm too far gone

â™ª No one here to help me

â™ª Too far gone

â™ª No one left to try

â™ª Too far gone

â™ª Shattered into pieces

â™ª Too far gone

â™ª Look me in the eyes

â™ª Too far gone

â™ª Fucked up is my life

â™ª I live each day

â™ª Taking chances

â™ª When it comes my way

â™ª Know I'm the black sheep

â™ª I'm your broken son

â™ª I can't help myself

â™ª I'm too far gone

â™ª No one here to help me

â™ª Too far gone...

South 62, I've got
that homicide suspect.

He's northbound past Weston
in the alley east of lonia.

â™ª Too far gone

â™ª Look me in the eyes

â™ª Too far gone, no!

â™ª No! No!

â™ª Too far gone...

South 64, do you copy? Over.

Go for Landry.

Blackstone homicide suspect's
been spotted northbound,

alley east of lonia. Wearing blue jeans,

a leatherjacket and a cap.

Copy. Get me eyes on him now.

â™ª Shattered into pieces

â™ª Too far gone

â™ª Look me in the eyes

â™ª Too far gone

â™ª No one here to help me

â™ª Too far gone

â™ª No one left to try

â™ª Too far gone

â™ª Shattered into pieces

â™ª Too far gone

â™ª Look me in the eyes

â™ª Too far gone.

What the fuck?
Don't even think about it.

Don't even think about it.

Ballsy fuckin' move,
you breaking in here.

Easy. I just wanna talk.
Fuck you, Shane. You killed my son.

I didn't have anything to do
with Pete getting killed.

Tony said you knew the guys who did it.

I arrested those scumbags
years ago when I was a cop,

which means absolutely nothing
unless you're trying

to frame me for something I didn't do.

Tony said--
Tony set the whole thing up!

Why was there so much cash
in the counting room?

We were expecting a big crowd.
And whose idea was it

to have that much money on hand?
Tony said we'd need extra.

That's because he had
four guys coming in to rip you off.

Tony wants your brother
to get rid of you

so he can run the House.

Vinnie, Tony's wife killed Carlos

over an hour ago.

Don't you see what's going on?

If Tony makes it look like
I set this whole thing up,

then I get whacked!

And maybe you get whacked too

depending on how he plays it.

Either way he ends up
running this place.

And he gets to keep the cash as a bonus.

You got it figured out,
don't you, Shane?

You're like a fucking
pitbull in a dog fight--

you dig in, you don't let go.

You son of a bitch.
Ray!

Put the bag down.

Ah-ah!

No escape this time, big guy.

Go ahead, open it.

Come on.

You stole from me.

You murdered my son.

That's right.

My whole fucking life I spent building

this place up with your older brother,
from the ground up.

And how does he repay me?

He turns it all over to you.

You were never part of this family.

Just some fuckin' douchebag
wannabe off the streets.

We gave you everything!

And I watched you bring it all down.

That's a fraction

of the money I've seen
you pocket from this place.

What? You think I was
gonna turn a blind eye,

watch you fuck it all up?

You're a dead man, Tony.

No matter what happens here tonight,

I guaran-fucking-tee you

you will be hunted like a fucking dog

to the ends of the earth!

It's my time now!

It's my time!

It's gonna break Carlos's fucking heart

when he finds out
you killed his brother.

You're so fuckin' stupid.

Your bitch of a wife
already killed Carlos

right before she took two in her chest.

What?

What the fuck you talking about?
You don't believe me?

No, I don't.
Call her, see if she picks up.

See if she's still fucking the old man.

Just like every Wednesday, right?

Go ahead, call her.

No.
I don't fuckin' believe you.

Here you go. Here you go,
Tony, it's all yours.

Everybody's out of the way.
Fuck you.

What the fuck is this?

Oh man, you're just in time.

25 grand, Detective-- it's your cut.

This wasn't our deal.

I should have fucking known
it was you who sold me out.

You shut the fuck up!
Your first mistake was coming after me.

We were partners!
I got a family to protect!

Something you don't know anything about.

Do it.

No way.

Do it.

Here's your chance. He shot Vincent.

Self-defense, right?
So shoot. Now fucking do it.

Come on.

Jim.
Get on your knees, Ray.

I need units to lonia and Franklin.

Homicide suspect in alley east of lonia

headed northbound.
Request immediate assistance.

Move! Move!

Come on, Jimmy, think about this.

Come on, you can't do this.
Get on your knees, Ray!

You do this,

you're gonna be his lap dog
for the rest of your life.

Shut the fuck up.
Then what?

Come on, Jimmy.
Are you gonna kill her, huh?

You're gonna have to.

Right? No witnesses.

Come on, Jimmy, think about this, man.

You can't do this, not for that scumbag.

Come on, we're friends.
Think about this.

You can't do this.

Think about this, Jimmy.

Come on!
Okay.

Move it!

Go!

Shit! Get down on the floor!

What the fuck are you doing?

Whoo!
Get it! Get it!

Whoo-hoo!
Look at this!

Where is he?
He went through the door.

Come on, you son of a bitch.

You couldn't let it go, could you, Ray?

Fuck you!
Fuck you.

I'll fucking take--

â™ª Grease me up with a bucket of sweat

â™ª I'm not leaving till
they're heading out, done yet?

Drop the gun!

Zello, you drop your weapon.

Shane fuckin' did this!

No, Tony set up the robbery.
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

Hey!
He killed Walter Randall,

he took out the shooters

and he just shot and killed
Detective Jimmy Lagrange.

I don't care who fuckin' did what.

I'm a witness. I saw him do it.

All right, I want to see your hands up

and get down on the ground.

Take it fuckin' easy.

You fuck.

Ray!

You fuckin' whore.
You fuckin' set me up.

No!

Oh my God! Ray.

Shane! You know the drill--

stay on your knees,
hands behind your head.

Nice and slow.

Officer. Officer, cuff him.

Run him out. Call it in.

Suspect's been apprehended.

Ray.

No, lady. No no.
He's innocent.

He's innocent.
No, ma'am, you can't.

We're gonna need to tape off the scene.

Ma'am.
Don't touch me!

He didn't do anything!

Ray, you have to
tell them what happened!

Ray!
It's okay, Jenny.

He's innocent.

It's all right.

Listen to him. It was Tony.
Ma'am, you can't see him.

Get away from me!

Ray!

Ma'am, you can't see him.
Get away from me!

You can't go down there.
Stop!

Everything's gonna be
fine now. Trust me.

Listen to him! He didn't do it!

You can't go--
Just go with them.

Get off-- get off me!

Ray.

I'm so sorry for everything.

I love you.

Have a great life, Jenny.

Okay, let's get out of here.
