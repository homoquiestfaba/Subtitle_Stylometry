W... welcome

to Radio Gibbons, Gibbons,

G-G-G-G-Gibbons.

Gibbons, Gibbons,

G-G-G-G-Gibbons.
â™ª Have a nice day. â™ª

It's 5:00 p.m.

We're your hosts,
June and Jennifer,

and you're joining us for...

BOTH:
<i>The Living Facts of Life.</i>

Today we'll be discussing
how to handle a divorce.

Yes, separations are very tough.

Difficult, but possible to do
while keeping your head high.

Even if you've married
a Scorpio.

No, no, don't do that.

Next time, consider a Libra.

They're polite
and considerate people.

(sighs heavily)

The suffering of men.

Men are dazzled by us and think
women are their superiors.


They get caught up
in a painful web of hurt

filled with anger
and desperation.

Perhaps it will help you
to remember

that men hate women
but cannot live without them.

It's possible
to love someone so much

you can't stand her

and, at the same time,
to want her dead.

I suppose love can also
be destruction.

Moving on. Let's take a break.
â™ª 1987. â™ª

BOTH:
With "Hot Love" by T. Rex.

Coming at you this fine
Monday afternoon.

â™ª Well, she's my woman of gold â™ª

â™ª And she's not very old,
ah, ha, ha â™ª

â™ª Well, she's my woman of gold â™ª

â™ª And she's not very old,
ah, ha, ha â™ª

â™ª I don't mean to be bold â™ª

â™ª A-but a-may I hold
your hand? â™ª

(speaks indistinctly

â™ª Well, she ain't no witch â™ª

JENNIFER: Yeah.
â™ª And I love the way she twitch â™ª

â™ª Ah, ha, ha â™ª

No, I didn't.

Yes, you did.

Yes, you did.

You moved.

JENNIFER:
I win.

You lose.

Liar.

I did not move.

You lost.

JIMMY YOUNG (over radio):
...competition.

The, uh, details were

JUNE (whispers):
<i>You will never find joy</i>

AUBREY:
I'm home. Everybody all right?

GLORIA: Aubrey, so,
help yourself to dinner.

I'm changing Rosie.

AUBREY:
How was your day, girls? Huh?

How was school?
GLORIA: David. Greta.

AUBREY: Good?
GLORIA: Come down here.

DAVID:
Yeah, all right, coming.

We'll have a nice dinner
today, huh?

Right, let's get the plates.

(Aubrey grunts)

GLORIA:
All of your food, okay, girls?

(phone ringing)

David, you want to get
the phone?

GLORIA: Sweetheart,
you want some peas? Yes?

You want some peas, eh, darling?
DAVID: Hello?

Greta, do you want some peas?
GRETA: No, thank you.

GLORIA: Mummy feed you
some peas today. Okay.

(David speaking indistinctly

You got homework today, girls?

Hmm?

No?

I didn't hear an answer.

Greta, come on.

They need to get their heads
bashed together.

DR. REES:
We're done, Catherine Jenkins.

Run along.

Next up, please.

Do you think you could keep
a stiff upper lip for me?

Just one.

Are you very scared?

What about you?

Are you scared?

Dr. Rees feels this issue
goes beyond the school's help.

Please understand,
I have 1,500 students.

My hands are full dealing
with the ones who are trouble.

I can't do much about the ones
who don't communicate.

We didn't do nothing
to the babies.

They were perfect.
AUBREY: Mm.

They giggled.

They spoke to me,

and then it was just less
and less, you know.

But nothing happened.

Nothing bad happened.

You're originally from Barbados?

Yes. Um...
the RAF moved us to Britain.

I am an air traffic controller.

Oh.

AUBREY:
We were told,

keep them in a normal school,
Mr. Davis.

Adolescence will resolve this.

They need a good education.

They need to be in school.

They speak all the time
in the bedroom.

They're just shy, you know.

DAVIS:
Mrs. Gibbons, please.

They won't get on
in a proper school

if they don't speak English.

We will move the girls
into special education.

We'll get them to talk yet.

(low chatter)

Come along.

Girls, come on.

It's a fresh start.

(departing footsteps)

TIM:
Hello, June. Hello, Jennifer.

My name is Tim Thomas.

I'm your teacher.

Okay.

I've recorded
some questions here,

and I've left enough space
for you to answer.

But if you don't want to answer
my questions

or you don't think my questions
are very good,

you're very, very welcome
to shout at me,

"Mr. Thomas,
your questions are rubbish."

Okay?

(tape whirring)

I'll close the door.

TIM (over tape): What do you
think of your new school?

(door closes)

Do you have any hobbies?

â™ª â™ª

Do you like cats?

What kind of music
do you listen to?

What do you like doing
during your free time?

How would you describe
your personalities?

BOY:
Oi.

TIM (over tape):
What is your favorite subject?

Which do you like better,
sunshine or rain?

Jennifer, June,
have you ever had a pet?

BOTH (whispering):
<i>Inky, Pinky, Perkins and Polly.</i>

<i>Inky, Pinky, Perkins and Polly.</i>

<i>Two little parrots
who were very jolly.</i>

<i>Then Perkins died,
and poor Polly cried.</i>

<i>Poor little Perkins and Polly.</i>

(fly buzzing)
(parrots squawking)

JENNIFER:
<i>Once, there were two parrots</i>

<i>who were brought up
to live in a zoo.</i>

<i>Every day, people would come
to the zoo</i>

<i>- and see the parrots.</i>
(inquisitive grunting)

(inquisitive squawking)
<i>- Sometimes the parrots</i>

<i>would mock the talking people,</i>

<i>and sometimes
they would actually</i>

<i>have a conversation
between themselves.</i>


<i>The people would stand there</i>

<i>-nearly all day</i>
-(buzzing)

<i>- listening to the parrots' conversation.</i>
(baby crying)

<i>The people thought it was</i>
<i>a bit weird</i> -(parrots crying)

<i>For two parrots to talk
as well as humans did.</i>

<i>The parrots, whose names
were Polly and Perkins,</i>

<i>often talked of how they longed</i>

<i>to get back
to their native land.</i>

<i>Sometimes they would ask
the watchers</i>

<i>to open the cage doors
and let them out.</i>

<i>The people would often laugh</i>

<i>the parrots were kidding.</i>

<i>Some of the children
who were watching</i>

<i>asked their parents</i>

<i>if they could take
the parrots home with them.</i>


Sometimes, before the parents
had time to answer,

one parrot would kindly say...

JUNE: "We're not for sale.
We're not for sale."

And the other parrot
would say the same.

JUNE: "We're not for sale.
We're not for sale."

"I am a very, very big man,
and I'm coming to get you."

"No, you're not.

You're not taking us anywhere."

"Yes, I am."

"No, you're not.
Go away, go away, go away."

"It'll taste very, very,
very good."

(diabolical laughter)

JUNE:
"No, you're not gonna eat us.

We're not tasty."

JENNIFER: "I will take you."
(diabolical laughter)

(squawking)
JUNE: "No. Go away, go away.

"Don't take us.
Don't take us away.

No, no, no, no. No."


"I want to have their liver
for 300 pounds,

"and then your heart
will only be one pound,

"and I'll eat it.

And it will be nice,
tasty and warm."

(diabolical laughter)

(horse snorting)

â™ª â™ª

JENNIFER (whispers):
<i>I move, you follow.</i>

JUNE:
<i>I follow, you move.</i>

JENNIFER:
<i>You move, I move.</i>

(horse snorts)
JUNE:<i> I follow, you move.</i>

Girls, you're doing beautifully.

JENNIFER:
<i>You, me, we, I.</i>

<i>Follow me else you die.</i>

(horse whinnying)
(June grunts)

(woman shouts)

TIM: Come on.
WOMAN: Oh, Jenny.

Jennifer, why did you do that?

You all right?
TIM: Are you okay?

Jennifer, why did you do that?

Look, I'll get straight
to the point.

If there's something you want
to communicate to me,

you best say it now.


You see, I...

I think you might be
a bad influence on each other.

It might be an idea to...

split you up for a while.

One of you can go to
Dr. Floyd's residential unit,

which isn't far from here,

then the other one
can stay here.

What do you think?

â™ª â™ª

(Tim sighs heavily)

Are you going to say anything?

Okay. I, uh...

I'll leave the room...

and let both of you
work out who goes where.

All right?

I'll just be out here.

TIM:
I'm giving them a few minutes.

(woman speaks indistinctly)

(Jennifer breathing heavily)


JUNE:
I hate you!

(woman exclaims)

WOMAN:
Oh, my God.

JENNIFER: You are nobody!
You are Jennifer!

You are me!
Girls. Girls, stop.

Gloria, that one look great, man.
Okay.

Hey, Greta, go and put the...
David, bring the juice.

Mark, you put the presents
over there.

Come through there.
Let's see the baby, man.

Let's see the baby.
Oh...

Ah, look at her, huh?
Just look at her.

It's all I do.
Come here, look at the baby.

I can't stop staring.
Come and see the family, man.

Beautiful, huh? Look at that.

This one.

Should I put the presents
under the tree or on the table?

On the table.
Okay.

And...

...the baby might be vegetarian,
but I made her a turkey.

Is that okay?

JUNE:
Yeah.

JENNIFER: And, and then
there's the family.

So... there's a mummy...

...daddy, Lucy, Suzie

and Thelma crazy.

So we walk into the living room
and we say...

BOTH:
Merry Christmas.

Said it a bit slow,
but I'll keep up with you.

Okay, a bit faster, then.

BOTH:
Merry Christmas.

Why don't you pop upstairs
and show the twinnies the baby?

I know they'd love to hold her.

What have they been
doing all day

now that school's done
with them?

Oh, music.
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas" playing)

Reading.

You know.

So, the same.

No. No. (chuckles)

Take her up.

In fact, I think they made her
some dolls.

GLORIA:
David, I'm missing a fork.

â™ª We won't go until we get
some â™ª -DAVID: Just a minute.

â™ª We won't go
until we get some â™ª

GLORIA:
What the hell?

â™ª So bring some out here... â™ª

GLORIA:
And bring the plates.

The good ones.
DAVID: Okay, I'll bring them in.

Hey.
(baby fussing)

Twinnies.

I've brought you Helen Marie.

JENNIFER AND JUNE:
Merry Chris...

Merry Christmas.

I've brought you Helen Marie.

You can hold her if you like.

Mummy said you made her a gift.

June?

Jennifer, what's in your hand?

Is it for Helen Marie?

It's nice.

I'm trying.

You could at least
say something.

Really?

You've been a burden on me
all my life.

An embarrassment to the family.


You can rot in here.

In your filthy little room,

with your piles
of crumpled paper

and your bits
of half-eaten food.

This is the last time
I make an effort.

I'm done.

Mark, we're leaving.

We're leaving.
GLORIA: What happened?

Did the twinnies say something?
We're leaving.

GRETA:
Yeah, Mum.

They said, "Merry Christmas.

Peace on Earth.
We love you so much."

(Aubrey sighs)

No...

GLORIA:
Oh, Lord Jesus.

(Gloria crying)

AUBREY:
Don't cry. It's all right.

It's all right. It's okay.

<i>Preston stopped.
His heart raced.</i>

<i>And anxiously,
he thought about Peggy.</i>

<i>She was a million miles away.</i>

Hello?

PEGGY (staticky):
Preston, is that you?

JUNE:
<i>Peggy's voice attacked his ears.</i>

PEGGY (staticky):
We're not leaving Malibu.

Are you listening?

I love you, and I can't go
to San Francisco.

I've gotta tell you something,
Preston.

We're not leaving Malibu.

Are you listening?

I love you, and I can't go
to San Francisco.

JUNE:

<i>He sank to the floor...</i>

Just because you've had
a burst of inspiration,

doesn't mean your book's going

You're just jealous of my focus.

You're a hack.

JUNE (gasps):
Wow.

Yes!

Jenny, New Horizon said
they'll publish my book

for 80 pounds a month.

I'm gonna need
a little bit of your dole.

Well, I need that money
for my book

because it's going
to be a knockout.

What do you mean?

You're writing a bunch of crap,

and no one's accepting it
anyway.

Don't be rude!

Look, this is a big deal for me.

Read it. Look.

And what do I get out of it?

Well, when you actually
get your book accepted,

I'll give you all my money,
I swear.

Please.

(breathes deeply)

Yes!

Okay. First things,

we need to take
professional photos.

All right? Come on. Smile.

(camera shutter clicks)

Let's go downstairs.

(door opens)

Perfect. Okay.

Make sure your face
is like this.

JENNIFER: To the side?
Yes, looking professional.

Okay, but...
Gorgeous.

Yeah, but get that right angle

because I don't want
to look fat.

Does my face look fat?

Looking great.
Mm-hmm.

Smile.

(June sniffles)

JENNIFER:
Okay.

No. No.

Oh, God, no.

No, no, no. Terrible, no.
JUNE: I don't like these.

JENNIFER: What am I doing there?
Look at this hair.

JENNIFER:
What is that?

What is that?
Why did you tell me to do that?

The composition of this photo does not...
Oh, my God.

I should have been so much
more serious about that diet.

JUNE: I've got spots.
Look at that spot. There.

JENNIFER: Oh, no. I'm way

I have a confession to make.

We burnt down a tractor store...

(laughing)
...in Haverford west.

Yeah, we're here now.

JENNIFER:
<i>Catch us if you can.</i>

MAN:
Jennifer Lorraine Gibbons,

you are charged
with the following counts.

You did jointly, with another,

enter a certain building,
as a trespasser,

steal 25 pencils,
one pair of headphones,

an electric clock,
a pair of scissors,

and a carton of Play-Doh,

of a value together
of 40 pounds and 50 pence.

Between the 15th and 18th
of October 1981,

at Haverford west
in the county of Dyfed,

did enter a certain building,
as a trespasser,

steal therein
drink and food items

to the value
of five pounds and 24 pence.

And on the 20th day
of October 1981,

without lawful excuse,
damaged by fire a tractor store.

Jennifer Lorraine Gibbons,

how do you plead,
guilty or not guilty?

G-g-g-g...

COURT CLERK:
And you, June Alison Gibbons,

have been charged
on the same counts.

How do you plead,
guilty or not guilty?

Uh, Dr. Hamilton, uh, thank you
for attending court today.

Could you please tell
the court your opinion

on how you found each of
the defendants' state of mind

when you examined them?

And could you give the court

your recommendations
that you have?

My professional opinion
is that each defendant

suffers from a mental illness.

A psychopathic disorder,
a subnormality of such a degree

to warrant their detention
in a hospital

for medical treatment.

As such,
admission has been arranged

for Broadmoor Hospital.

(shocked murmuring)

JUDGE:
Does Broadmoor have facilities

that people of their age
require?

It is not,
not usual for persons so young

to come to Broadmoor.

Uh, however, I think compared
to the remand centre,

Broadmoor offers a certain
freedom and also therapy.

Uh, their treatment there

will consist of teaching them
to speak.

And we maintain a sort
of village-like atmosphere

at the hospital.

There are gardens.

Uh, we have, uh, hairdressers,

uh, beautiful bathrooms,
and such.

Sports facilities for
maintaining patients' fitness.

Oh, and, uh,
we even have a swimming pool.

their tendencies to be
dangerous to themselves

and in view of the difficulty
of the prognosis,

would you recommend

Stand up, Jenny!

Jenny, get up.

JENNIFER:
â™ª That was our laughing â™ª


â™ª And that, too,
was our smiling â™ª

â™ª And now â™ª
(June sniffling)

â™ª I'm dead â™ª

â™ª And that, too,
is your crying â™ª

â™ª I'm not calling for you â™ª

â™ª Out of my love for you â™ª

â™ª I'm not calling you â™ª

â™ª But if you hear me â™ª

â™ª I got you â™ª

â™ª Now you're â™ª

â™ª Free â™ª
