            -This is
 "Dude Bro Party Massacre III."

     -What you doing, buddy?

      You mowing the lawn?

D-u-u-ude!

          -Br-o-o-o-o!

          -P-a-a-arty!

Massacre!

             -Three.

      Three times this week
      you've been in here,

    and you've yet to tell me
 why you keep saying "massacre."

    -It was just so painful.

    There was so much blood.

            -Brock...

      This is a safe place.

     I need you to open up.

       This is about those
    two previous mass murders

     on Frat Row, isn't it?

          I don't know
    if I can talk about that.

          It's just...

           so painful.

         Okay. I'll try.

The first party massacre started

with a panty raid gone wrong.

    The sorority house mother
           was pissed.

        No one taught her
       how to open doors.

        But she learned.

  And she was out for revenge.

              -Oh!
        Little help, bro?

       Wh-- Wha-- Oh, no!

          -Road Doggie
      was her first victim.

      -Daddy's bro. Ugh...

   -Next, she went after Cindy
          and C-Trunk.

          -Oh, C-Trunk.

          Oh, C-Trunk!

     -What's taking you bros
       so long to shower?!

      -But when she killed
         Coach Handsey,

       I had to wonder...
              -Aah!

    -...was she on our side?

          -Good throw.

          -She wasn't!
              -Aah!

             -Whoa!
              -Ohh!

      -She hunted us down!

Frat Row was no longer a street.

       It was...a river...

              -Ohh!
          -...of blood!

   It was the death of Scooter
    that rallied us together.

              -Aah!

   -The house mother was dead,
              see?

       And I became a full
         Delta Bi Theta.

    But little did we know...

     mother had a daughter.

      Anyway, junior year,
      we raged even harder.

       We thought we were
       gonna live forever.

        -And then fire...

         -We were wrong.

         -Could you hold
       my hair back, bro?

    -Someone took her place.

           Motherface.

    The junior-year streaking
     contest was under way.

  I was supposed to officiate,

        but I couldn't go
     because I got pink eye.

      That fart on my face
         saved my life.

     Too bad I couldn't say
  the same for Jimmy Galoshes.

         No one was safe
        from her wrath...

        -Yeah. "Areolas."
        Gonna masturbate.

   -...not even Little Spoon.

              -Aah.

      -Not Timmy and Tommy,
      the Birdstone twins.

    -Look, babe -- no hands!

       Not concert pianist
         Chaz Noodlemen.

         -Aah! Aah! Aah!

           -Aah! Aah!

   -Not even our weed dealer.

        There was no way
    to deal with the stress.

             -Aaaah!

    -Randall went on to have
           three kids.

         He seems happy.
   I'm actually grabbing lunch

       with him tomorrow.

  But then she killed Dolphman.

    It was Delta Bi genocide.

         But in the end,

    thanks to our good looks
    and bond of brotherhood,

          the Delta Bis
      triumphed once more.

    -Looks like your flame...
            retarded.

       -I projected an air
    of cool, calm confidence,

   'cause I'm Brock, you know?

  But something in her eyes --

 something told me that nothing
     could stop Motherface.

     ...not even the grave.

             -Brock!

        The serial killer
  known as Motherface is dead.

           You told me
    you killed her yourself.

 It's time you take your life...

            ...back.

           -Thank God
      my twin brother Brent

       didn't want to get
  involved in the Greek system.

     We used to be so close.

   We haven't talked that much
          since we went

     to different colleges,
         but I still...

           feel him...

  like we have some sort of...

    psychological connection.

  -Brock, I need you to tell me
   what you're most afraid of.

   -Besides seeing all my bros
   killed before my very eyes?

       -Yes, besides that.

   Please, tell me everything.

         -I don't know.

        After watching 17
       of my best friends

 get killed by some crazy lady,

    I guess you could say I'm
  a little bit afraid of women.

    -Well, then it looks like
       we're gonna have to

     cut this session short.

        -Oh, I thought we
   were making good progress.

             Really?
      What are you doing?!

  -Aah! Damn it, Brock Chirino,
            you punk!

    You're gonna kill someone
        with that thing!

              -No.
  Ernest, that's Brent Chirino,

      Brock's twin brother.

       He transferred here
     after Brock was killed

 in that brutal freak accident.
              -Oh.

    You know I've been trying
to work on my temper, Sebastian.

     Brock was the coolest.

           -Hey, there
  goes that sexy Brent Chirino.

 Too bad his twin brother died.

        I would've loved
      to have been the meat

    in that Chirino sandwich.

         -Yeah, at least
      Brock wore a helmet!

   I'm looking at you, Brent!

   If you're hiding any drugs
    in your butthole, missy,

        I swear to God...

            -Brent...

           -Look out!

             -Brent.

      -There's still time!

              -Unh!

 You really threw me for a loop.

  I was on the edge of my seat.

   Say, aren't you that fella
whose cool brother was murdered?

           -Whatever.

 I don't want to talk about it.

     -Well, name's Nedry --

        Nedry Headcheese.

           -Chirino --

         <i> Brent</i> Chirino.

      -I think you'll find
      I have a lot to offer

        as a best friend.

         -Whatever, man.
  I'm not here to make friends.

      I'm here to find out
     who murdered my brother

        and get revenge.

    -Say, isn't this the frat

      your murdered brother
          belonged to?

 Maybe we could pledge together,

      find out what<i> really</i>
    happened to your brother.

       I always thought...

       -I promised myself

I would never join a fraternity.

   I already had one brother.

I don't need any other brothers.

        -And that's why,
  even though a pack of wolves

    took the use of my legs,

       I decided to become
        a zoology major.

         My whole family
  was once murdered by wolves.

      -Well, well, well...

   If it isn't Brock Chirino,
       back from the dead.

           -Actually,
I'm Brock's twin brother, Brent.

             -Weird.

   Hey, you looking to pledge?

        Great to have you
        aboard Delta Bi.

            -Oh, I --
            -But I --

     I understand, you know?

   If you need some more time
           to get over

 your brother's tragic death...

              -No.

       I'm done grieving.

       I'm ready to party
    until my pants fall off.

   -Welcome to Delta Bi Theta.

    I think you're gonna fit
     right in with the guys.

 I'm Derek. I'm the friendliest
      guy you'll meet here.

    -Shut the fuck up, Derek!

      -Nice comeback, bro.

     Don't mind the camera.
           That's Z.Q.

You should see the workout tapes
      he makes of us bros.

    They're very...artistic.

              -Hi.
             -Hello.

            -Come on.
        Let's go inside.

      -Siskel and Ebert say
         "Pizza Goblins"

       is "family magic."

     "Two thumbs way down."

          -Dragons fr--

      -Welcome to Delta Bi.

           You'll see
that the party never stops here.

          That's Spike.
 He rages harder than any of us.

         Classic Spike.

     That there is Sizzler.

 He's trying to pledge Delta Bi,

       but he won't get in
    'cause he's a vegetarian.

             -What?

      -This here is Samzy.

          He has a lot
  of memories of your brother.

   -I made them just like you
  like them, Samzy -- overhard.

Pretty nice.
      Overhard.

        Like you, Samzy.

             -Sorry.

    Samzy's a bit of a bitch.

     -Oh. That explains it.

         -This is Todd.

    We call him T-O-Double-D
           for short.

          He's pre-med.
    Smartest guy in the frat.

              -Ohh!

     Jesus, Derek, not now!

     I got a lot on my mind.

       Look at all my work
         that I'm doing.

    With midterms and finals
      for everyone, what...

             Brock?
  -Oh, this is actually Brent,

      Brock's twin brother.

             -Weird.

           -Surprise!
              -No!

              -Ugh!
    Samantha, what the fuck?!

   -That's Todd's girlfriend,
            Samantha.

She's a psych major, which means
      she's a total psycho.

       But, uh, you know,
     she owns a motor home,

          so it's cool.
              -Oh.

      -Babe, you can't keep
         coming in here,

    bringing delicious treats
             for me.

 -But you deserve a treat, Todd!

 Just a little bit of pampering

   before our big anniversary
         getaway weekend

     in old-town Sacramento.

I guess I do deserve a treat.

            -Mm-hmm.

 -But they're over on the floor.

  -Sorry I tossed your cookies
           back there.

          -That's okay.
         I'm used to it.

       -What do you mean?

       -I've always wanted
        to be a Delta Bi.

   -Be one of these guys? Why?

  -Delta Bi is the coolest frat
            in Chico,

         but I'm a girl,

     so I could never join,
    even though I'm a legacy.

           -Listen...

             I know
  what it's like to not belong.

             -Brent!

       -I'm coming, guys!

           I'm coming!

       All right, I came.

   -Some pretty sweet tai chi
           back there.

     Knew you'd fit in here.

   -But I never knew tai chi.

  My dead brother knew tai chi.

           -You okay?

             -Sure.

  Uh, where's Brock's old room?

             -Yeah.

 -And the winner for best dancer
     at prom, Brent Chirino!

              -Ugh!
        This is my room!

 I called dibs on this room like
  two minutes after Brock died!

              Shit!

   You got to get out of here!

     I got to haze a pledge
           right now.

       -This is Turbeaux.
         -I'm Turbeaux.

              Shit!
        Pinch me, pledge.

               Oh!
        Pinch me harder!

              Aah!
     Guess I'm not dreaming.

   Brock told me about you --

             little
   Brenty Brent Brent Chirino.

              Hmm!
He said you're a bit of a loner.

      -Actually, Turbeaux,
Brent's thinking about pledging.

          -Oh, really?!

 You want to get into this frat?

 You want to learn our secrets?

   You got to get through me.

            Sizzler!

     Or maybe you don't have
 what it takes to be a Delta Bi.

           -Do or die!

  -You think you can handle...

             this?!
              -Aah!

-You<i> think</i> you can handle this?!

              -Ohh!

          -You think...

      you can handle this?

              -Aah!

             -This?
              -Aah!

             -This?

              -Ohh!
             -This?

     -Aah! Aah! Aah! Aahn=!

-You think you can handle this?!

        Do you...think...

  you...can... handle...this?!

    Watch me not give a shit!

            Sizzler!
              -Ohh!

    -I don't care about you!

          I don't care
      where you came from!

  Your ancestors mean nothing!

  You bring shame to all of us!

           -Yes, sir.

           -Actually,
    Brent was thinking about

         helping us out
     with our senior prank.

          -Oh, really?

        Well, our pranks
    are pretty goddamn wild.

        This year's gonna
        be no different.

        Gonna be bonkers!

  We're gonna need a real party
   boy to pull off this prank.

          Is that you?

     You daddy's party boy?

              -Yes.

          -Look at you.
   You'll never be a Delta Bi.

     I'm gonna whup your ass
     with my big paddle now.

       It's in my closet.

            Aaaaaah!

Oh, man!

              -God!
       -I think I captured

    some genuine fear there.

           -God, guys!

       You know how I feel
        about baby dogs!

              -Oh!
       We got you so good!

   -Get the fuck out of here,
            Samantha!

             -Why?!

        God, guys! Guys!

      -I got this for Brock
     for his 16th birthday.

It looks just like our childhood
        dog, Dr. Bagels.

     -To me -- to Turbeaux!
              -Ha!

          -To your bro!

      -But I need Turbeaux
          to trust me.

      -I hate puppies, too!

              Unh!

            -Really?

 Maybe you are okay, Not Brock.

       Maybe you are okay.

  Hey, Sizzler, get the window.
   Z.Q., shut that camera off.

             Brent,
 think about spending the night

           in my room
     once I'm all moved in.

         Let's check out
       these prank plans.

              -Oh.
 First, we're gonna need these.

          -That's tape.

             -Whoo!

            Goddamn!

      -They gave us so much
       of that beer stuff.

        I have the spins.

  I can't even read this sign.

       -Calm down, Nedry!

According to these plank prints,

    it says the college radio
   station is right up there.

          So, remember,
     when we get on the air,

        you're gonna say,

 "Dean Pepperstone eats farts,"
              okay?

 And be sure not to mess it up,

      'cause I have to get
         into this frat

to find out who was the murderer
         to my brother.

 -Whatever you say, best friend!

They murdered my brother!

          -Chico Tower,
   this is Pan Am flight 912,

 requesting permission to land.

             -Okay!
  Dean Pepperstone eats farts!

        -Dean Pepperst--

         Listen, this is
   air-traffic control tower.

     Get off this frequency!

  -You get off this frequency.

         -I am a pilot.
     I have a plane to land!

        I'm gonna crash!
  -Dean Pepperstone eats farts!

     -Oh, God, I'm so sorry!

      -You Delta Bi Thetas
 have done it for the last time!

     You killed 250 people,

     and I do not eat farts.

  -Listen, you need to give us
        a second chance.

 -I've given you enough chances!

        Need I remind you
      of last year's prank,

  when you broke the county dam

   and submerged Ol' Parchtown
            in water?

 -But we created New Lake City.

   -You drowned 4,000 people.

    -The paddle-boat business
        is booming there.

    -Don't make me remind you
    of sophomore-year prank.

-Sophomores, get to the chopper!

         We are leaving!

 Sophomores, get to the chopper!

        -That's not fair!

      Freshman-year prank,
       let me remind you,

          we helped...

    depose a Central American
            dictator.

That's true.
Your heavy-metal hot-air balloon

    did drive General Cortez
   from the Brazilian embassy,

            which is
  why I'm only suspending you.

      -During Greek Week?!

     What's wrong with you?!

            -Come on!
    It's like Easter for men!

          -You can have
       your own Greek Week

out at the old sorority house...

          by the lake.
           -What? Ugh!

       -They never pick up
         their dog shit!

         -It's haunted!
              -No!

       -Go there, brother.

  -Guys, a weekend at the lake?

     That's nothing, right?

       It'll be like a --
     like a Dude Bro party!

          -Yeah. Okay.

             -Yeah.

        A Dude Bro party.

And maybe you could invite some,

       uh, young, nubile,
    recently divorced women?

              -No!
              -No!

           -Bullshit!

            -Come on!
        No girls allowed!

      -Fine! Fine! Get out!

      Get out, all of you!

       -Somebody help me!

      -Should I lock this?

           -It's done.

           -Excellent.

       Soon, the Dude Bros
   will taste their own blood.

     All that's required now
     is a virgin sacrifice.

       Virgo sacrificium.

           -Yes, yes.
        Virgo Sacramento.

            Whatever.
       -Virgo sacrificium.

       Virgo sacrificium.

              -No!

               No!

            Aah! Ohh!

              Aah!

              Aah!

       -Virgo sacrificium!

 -I'm an immortal fuck machine!

     -Buttiker, get in here!

             -Uh-oh!
      Someone's in trouble!

          -Yes, Chief.
     -Ah. Candace Buttiker.

       First in your class
        at Naval Academy,

      in Valencia, Florida.

        Are you ready for
          a real-world

      Chico police mission?

        -Oh, daddy like!

   -What have you got for me,
             Chief?

      -Motherface is rising
       on the harvest moon

     to kill the Delta Bis,

     but her plan won't work
   without a virgin sacrifice.

     That's where that idiot
     virgin Sminkle comes in

      -Aah! Fuck! My face!

      -You want me to send
  Officer Sminkle to his death.

    -You see, only his death
 will give Motherface the power

     to defeat the Delta Bis
    when it matters the most.

-And, um, what would you like me
          to tell him?

Watch this.

      Sminkle, get in here!

   -Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
   oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

       Aw, come on, Chief!

 I thought we talked about this.

        No girls allowed
        in the Dude Room.

       I'm fine. Ah-choo!

              -Aah!
         What the hell?!

          -Sminkle, um,

   I have kind of an important
    assignment for you, if --

 if you think you're up for it.

          -Oh, my gosh.
         Oh, absolutely.

     Wait a second, though.
   Don't -- don't you hate me?

      'Cause you called me
     a cum bubble yesterday.

-Well, the way you got that girl
           to confess

       that she was hiding
  those drugs in her butthole,

   that was pretty impressive.

          And I'd like
  to kind of give you a reward.

     You know about Chico's
 orange-shortage problem, right?

            -Oh, yes.
   It's very terrible, Chief.

   City-wide vitamin-C levels
     have never been lower.

           -Well, uh,
   turns out your old friends

       the Dude Bros are,
          in reality...

        bags of oranges.

       -I should've known.

   -So, what I need you to do
          is find them,

      bop them on the nose,

       and turn them back
    into their actual forms,

    which as I said earlier,

      are bags of oranges.

     Save our city, Sminkle.

        Officer Buttiker
       will accompany you

to bop the Dude Bros on the nose

     and turn them back into
    bags of fucking oranges.

 -Got it! You won't regret this,
         Chief-a-rooney!

   -See? Now Officer Sminkle's
            Spazwagon

        is all gassed up.

  The Dude Bros are at the old
   sorority house by the lake.

          And get there
    before the harvest moon.

  The town is depending on you.

         -Come on, guys!

  Let's get some tunes in here!

    -What the shit is this?!

          -Yeah, Todd.

     What<i> is</i> all this about?

 -Flowers, the music, champagne,

 that banner I refuse to read...

   -Guys, Samantha loves you,

    and she wants us to have
    a good time by the lake.

              -Aah!

      -Hey, Todd, Samantha
    take your virginity yet?

            -Not yet.

  She's been really pushing me,
             though.

 And I'm not ready to be a dad.

    -Guys, there's baby stuff
          in here! Gah!

    -Hey! No! No baby stuff!

          -Baby hats...
      -Put that stuff back!

           No babies!
   -No, Todd, we're Americans!

   We can do whatever we want
      with no consequences!

  -No consequences in America!

       -A toast to Brent.

              -Boo!

   -Hey, now, pour that pledge
  a pint of Prosecco, partner.

  Chirino perfectly pulled off
        our senior prank.

    We wanted the whole world
  to know that Dean Pepperstone

           eats farts.
           -Thank you.

          -And I think
      they got the message.

        -Speech! Speech!
           Right now!

             -Um...

 I guess I just want to say, uh,

    I can see why my brother
   was so stoked on you guys.

              Um...

           and, uh...

            Titties.

             -Yeah!

              Yeah!
           -All right.

             -Yeah!
             -Whoo!

             -Yeah!

     -Yes! Oh, my favorite!

             -Yeah!
 -Forever's gonna start tonight!

      -Delta Bi! Do or die!
           -It speaks!

      -Delta Bi! Do or die!

      Delta Bi! Do or die!

      Delta Bi! Do or die!

      Delta Bi! Do or die!

      -Delta Bi! Do or die!
      Delta Bi! Do or die!

      -How are we gonna get
        across this lake?

  -Well, that's enough footage
            of that.

       Someone want to get
         his attention?

        -Come on, pledge.

    I'm over this tear shit.

   Go get us some paddy boats.

            Come on!

        -Uh...Uh, hello?

            -Go away!

          Can't you see
     I'm mourning the dea--

               Oh.

              Hey!
         The Delta Bis!

     I was just celebrating
         the anniversary

         of my business
    finally taking off, huh?

         I have you boys
       to thank for that.

        Stand over there,
     next to my dead family!

            Come on.
              Yep.

      Nobody wanted to rent
 a paddy boat in Ol' Parchtown.

     I was swimming in debt.

 Until you boys flooded the town

  and drowned my whole family,
            that is.

    Now business is booming!

    Go ahead -- put your arm
         around my wife.

My beautiful wife!

 She died doing what she loved.

           -Drowning?
             -Yeah.

         Not much reason
      for swimming lessons

 if you lived in Ol' Parchtown,

   which is what made it such
   a particularly funny prank.

   -Now let's do a goofy one!

      I said make it goofy!

     That's a great picture.

            Oh, man,
    that's my baby boy, too.

  16 months old when the water
         took him away.

     You guys still got it!

    Pranksters till the end!

        The bitter...end.

      You boys want to rent
          a paddy boat?

         What paddy boat
  are you gonna choose, Brock?

           -I'm Brent.
        -Okay. All right.

 -I trust that you have a paddy
   boat that will accommodate

          my lifestyle.
              -No.

              -Oh.

    -If I remember correctly,
            and I do,

 there's a handicap paddle boat
    about 20 miles that way.

             -Yeah!
        Fuck off, Nerdry!

    -Don't tell me to F off!

           I'll F you
 if you don't come back for me!

          -Whoa, whoa!
        Nerdry, come on.

     You're in college now.

       You can say "fuck."

         Give it a try.

         -F-f-f-f-f-f...

        F-f-f-f-f-f-fu--

    You won't leave me here,
            will you?

     -I got to go with them.
         You understand.

              Here.

     In case your wheelchair
          breaks down.

          -Uh, thanks.

          Radical deck.

   Well, see you there, Brent.

     Don't forget to avenge
     your murdered brother!

             -Okay!
        One more picture!

        And surprise me!

  Like when you blew up the dam

        and took everyone
        I knew and loved!

    -Well, they don't call me
    Ol' Iron Arms Headcheese

          for nothing.

       Just 20 more miles,

 and I'll have an ice-cold brew
         waiting for me.

               Ha!

        Oh, monkey butts.

      Is it so pooping hard
        to load a legacy

 into a -- a whore paddle boat?!

           That's it.

        I'm gonna say it.

     F-f-f-fuck this creek!

        Those dick farts
 never gave two shitting bitches

      about Ol' Iron Arms.

          They'll see.

     I'll show those vagina
       faces what's what.

  Those Delta Bi titty jizzers
will regret the day they were --

Guys?

              Help.

       -My psychic told me
   my son's head would cave in

      from a car accident,

     and hello, prom night.

   -And the number-one reason

          men and women
     just can't get along...

       The remote control!

   What do you think, Candace?

     Think Letterman will go
        for these lists?

   -I'm not here to humor you,
            Sminkle.

    -Top 10 reasons Letterman
 will go for these Top 10 lists.

           Number 10,
    my boundless enthusiasm.

    -32 more hours, Candace.

       -Number 9, that man
    is slapping a little boy.

             -What?
          -That man is

     slapping a little boy!
          -Oh, my God!

-You think you're cooler than me

       just 'cause you got
     a fancy tie and a job?!

             -Yaaah!

         Here's $100 and
   "The Grapes of Wrath," kid!

        Get out of town!
        Change your name!

 Start a new life for yourself!

     Keep going! Keep going!
         You can do it!

 And once you get into the trees
         for the night,

       I want you to read
       that fucking book!

-That was, uh, pretty impressive
      how you handled that.

          -Yeah, well,
 every child deserves a chance.

           -Aaaaaaah!

        -I love children.

   They're the future that we
    screwed up for ourselves,

            you know?
          So innocent.

 I guess you probably don't care
     about this crazy dream

     that I have, but, uh...

        I want to open up
 a mobile library for children.

            -Really?
    -You see, the first time

         I read a book,
       my mind went bang!

         Like, anything
  in the universe was possible,

        and I could find
 it all in the pages of a book.

           And, well,
    that's what I want to do

 for all the children of Chico.

  I just want to bang them all.

             -Um...
       -I'm gonna call it

  Sminkle's Bang Bus, Candace.

  No more waiting in the public
library to bang every kid I see.

  No, sir, I'm going to travel
      from block to block,

screaming out my window for kids

     to climb aboard my bus
      and get banged silly.

            -I mean,
your heart's in the right place,

but, um, how about "bookmobile"?

             -Yeah?
   -Not gonna lie, Candace --

    that sounds real boring.

 I would not want to get banged
        in a bookmobile.

          My bang bus.
            -Oh, no!

         Oh, no, no, no!
          -My bang bus!

            My dream!

            -Sminkle!

            -Aw, man!

        Why does it have
   to not be a person anymore?

              -Ugh.

          -There it is.

     The old sorority house
          by the lake.

      -Damn it! This place
     is a fucking shit-hole!

         Who did this?!

              -Aah!

       -Someone -- someone
   else somewhere is in here.

     -Relax, bros! It's me!
           -Rip Stick!

     -Thought you'd rock out
  on the lake without me, yeah?

      -We thought you died
         in the embassy.

  -Part of me did die that day.

        But now I'm back!

      Rippin' and stickin'!

 And I see I'm not the only one
   back from the dead, Brock.

         -Brock did die.

 That's his twin brother, Brent.

             -Weird.

        Well, let's clean
      this stupid shit-hole

    up so we can party, eh?!

             -Yeah!

           -All right!

Hey!

     -This is more like it,
           huh, guys?

             -Okay.
       Now start partying.

             -Yeah!

          -Oh! No, no!
      It's happening again!

             Again!
      It's happening again!

     -What is your problem,
             Samzy?!

    -Yeah, chill out, Samzy!

      -Self-righteous fuck!

 -Samzy, you need to chill out,
           all right?

    This is just an old house
      with old fuses, bro.

           -Old fuses.

  -That's what I said -- fuses.

        -Old fuses, huh?

 -They are fuses, motherfucker!
           -It's old!

  -The fuse box is in the shed,

    if I remember correctly.

   -Derek, you know how to be
    a handyman from your dad.

          Go out there.
          -I told you,

      I hate handyman work.

  -You never told me that, bro.
     You never told me that.

   I would have not said that
if you had told me that earlier.

          I'm so sorry.

       -Here goes nothing.

        All right, Derek,
        you can do this.

       You've been working
    with a therapist on this.

         You can do it.

       They're just tools.

    They're all just a bunch
            of tools.

             Oh, no!

   All just a bunch of tools.

          Aha. Gotcha.

             Aaaah!

       -Hoes before bros!

Derek did it!

        The electricity!

      -Come dance with us.

   -Brent, go dance with them.
               Go.

           Go, go, go.

           -D-a-ance?

          With someone?

        I did that once.

     -There you are, Brent.

       What are you doing?

  Prom limo's waiting outside.
             -Whoo!

       -I'm scared, Brock.

   I've never been with a girl
            before...

          dancing-wise.

             You...

      You weren't supposed
          to see this.

   -Dancing is easy, Brent --

  if you have a plan, that is.

              Here.

        Let me show you.

    Follow the natural rhythm
          of the music.

  Ease into her smooth curves.

  The body wants what it wants.

    -I think I'm getting it!

           -Dancing is
     like tai-chi fighting.

 It's all about the transference
           of energy.

      Just use her inertia
          against her.

         That's it now.

             Whoooa!

              -Oh.

 -Oh, and first thing tomorrow,

     we're gonna return that
 mannequin to T.J. Maxx, buddy.

           -All right.

           Oh, Brock,
       what am I gonna do

         when you go off
        to East Chico U.?

 -Hey, you'll make some friends
          of your own.

  -But everybody sucks but us.

 -Remember what I always say --

       when you face a foe

          you're afraid
       you can't defeat --

             Murder!

         Aahhhhhhhhhhh!

         -Aah! Aah! Aah!

              Aah!

              Aah!

         It's horrible!

         Someone killed!

    -What's going on, Spike?

 -Spike, tell us what happened!

       -Someone killed...

          all the beer!

          -This can...

           Shotgunned.

             -Why?!

   Who would do such a thing?!

          -Did you know
      about his worst fear?

      -Running out of beer?

   -I think it's pretty clear.

    -We'll get to the bottom
            of this.

         But right now,
     beer run, pledge, now!

     -I'll take the pledge.

    I was planning on getting

some candid nature shots anyway.

 -Yeah, yeah, sounds real great.

     Just one thing, pledge!

    Welcome to the beef box,
         population you.

   This is where you live now,
         in this thing.

         Lick the inside
      for a 3-D experience,

      you little shit bag.

        -All these bills!

             Aaaaah!

         -Your vagina --

  -Uh, you sure you don't want
       me to call my dad,

 just have him come pick us up?
              -No!

 I've got to fix this on my own!

    Plus, you murdered a guy!
              -Hey!

     Stuff happens, Candace.

      That's the real world
           we live in.

  Well, the wolves are coming.

   Let's spend the night here.

     Clean up the dead parts
         in the morning.

What's wrong?

           -I'm sorry.

    I've just had a hard time
        sleeping since...

          -Since what?

          -The Dude Bro
      sophomore-year prank.

           -Oh, yeah.

    The sophomore-year prank.

       I remember it well.

      -Time's up, Sminkle.

  But you know what you can get
    for another $200, right?

   -Who the fuck do you think
  you're talking to, Fantasia?!

    I own this fucking town!

          I am eternal!

          I am eternal!

  Well, I don't really remember
    the sophomore-year prank,

          but I'm sure
     it was something awful.

         We're gonna get
    those Dude Bros, Candace.

 I don't know if you've ever...

         bopped anybody
 on the nose before, but, uh...

   it sure brings about a lot
           of closure.

             -Yeah.
    -Oh, um, I kind of sleep

       with my eyes open.

       It's just a thing.

           -It's okay.

    -Hang in there, partner.

           Good night.

          -Good night.

            Sminkle?

   -Z.Q., I can't see a thing
         in this thing.

 -Life is tough in the beef box,
             pledge.

            You know,
   you can get out of that box

  if you just man up and beef.

      I beefed on day five.

             Spike,
   he beefed like every hour.

           It's like,
  "Spike, slow your roll, man.

      Don't beef so fast."
       He wouldn't listen.

       Turbeaux, he beefed
  before he even got in there.

        Dude's a machine.

  -Those guys seem pretty wild.

        -So fucking wild.

   -Can I tell you something,
              Z.Q.,

something I haven't told anyone?

         -Sure, Sizzler.

 -Sometimes, I think those guys
        don't respect me.

  And I'll never be a Delta Bi

          even if I get
   out of this cold beef box.

     -Delta Bis have to have
           confidence.

            In there,
 you have to think on your feet,

   'cause it's all you've got.

      My advice, if you're
    getting cold, just beef.

     Get a good steam going.
     -I don't want to beef.

 -Let go of your fears and beef.

        -My fear is beef!

      And pork and chicken
    and all that gross stuff!

      No one respects that.

     I'll never fit in here.

   -Don't get cranky with me,
             pledge!

     Just because I like you

   doesn't mean you're getting
     out of that box early.

     You, uh -- you hungry?

   You know, through my lens,
   I see the souls of my bros.

   I've seen your inner truth.

     You've got beef in you.

   I'm not gonna let you quit.

  You have too much potential.

           Oh, Brock,
 how am I supposed to avenge you

         if I can't find
        any stupid clues?

    Anyway, good to see you,
             like --

              Whoa.

               Oh!

             Clues!

            <i> -Oh, no!</i>

-Can you hold my hair back, bro?

             -Clues!

             -Brock.

       Is that you, Brock?

              -Yes.
            -Strange.

         I have memories
  of your corpse, a flagpole...

           your anus.

    -Must have been a dream.

         -I don't dream.

       -You should try it.
            It's fun.

          You can fly,
 you can fuck whatever you want.

           It's great.

   -What's that on your face,
             Brock?

        -It's chocolate.

    I'm saving it for later.

   -Did you miss your brother?

             -Brent?

     No, he -- he's a loser.

           -Peculiar.

   You used to cry every night

   for having pushed him away
  to keep him safe from this...

           nightmare.

      Dance with me, Brock.

         Dance with me,
    just like we did in 1986

 at the rhythm and blues mixer.

 -That's when the second string
  of murders started happening!

       Do you remember --
           -Dance now.

    -But my investigation --
         -Now we dance.

            Catch me.

             -Whoa!

             Heavy!

              Ohh!

         Oh, no! Oh, no.

       No, no, no, no, no.
            Come on.

          Sam-- Samzy?

You're okay!
       You're okay, Samzy!

    Heavy! Come on! Come on!

          Think, Brent.
          Think, Brent.

      Everybody likes you.
       You're a good guy.

      They'll believe you.
         Samzy, Samzy...

          -Oh, my God!

   I see what's going on here.

      He's wasted on beer!

         You lied to me!

              Aah!

     -This coffee's so lame.

              -Aah!
 -Did somebody say orange juice?

        -Oh, oh, oh God!

            The beer!

            Oh, God!
            Oh, God!

       Oh, fuck you, tree!
               No!

        Oh, beer! No! No!

          Oh, God, no!
             Oh, no!

              Aah!

        Oh, it can't be!

            Oh, beer!

              Beer!

            Oh, beer!

               Oh!

      Oh, it's still cold!

         Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

               Oh!

          Oh, perfect!
    Now I just need the tap.

         Where's the...

        Where's the tap?!

         -It's all head.

 -So, Hamlet's not in the play.

        -No, he's in it.
    It's just not about him.

      It's about these two
         side characters

           that nobody
     thought were important.

      -Seems unnecessarily
          pretentious.

          -What?! Aah!

             -Boom!

            Oh, yeah!

       -All right, pledge.

   You're in the final stretch

    of the Delta Bi biannual
         bicep gauntlet.

           You've lost
 to pretty much every bro here.

    Now you're gonna face me.

        And if you lose,

   you're going in the barrel,

       and I'm gonna read
    what you've been writing

 in that stupid diary of yours!

          -My journal.

           -All right.

         -Kick his ass.

          3,<i> tres,</i> go!

         -I already know
 what today's entry's gonna be.

      "Dear Diary, I lost,

    and now I'm in a barrel."
              -No.

             -Yeah!
              -No.

             -Yeah!
            -Please.

         -"Please" what?
     -Please don't beat me!

          -Okay. Maybe.

          Just kidding.
              -Ohh!

Aah!

             -Yeah!
              -Yay!

           -Hey, guys!
              -Aww!

      -Babe, what the fuck
      are you doing here?!

      -Yeah! What the fuck,
           Samantha?!

     -What the fuck, Todd?!

          You can't let
      your girlfriend come!

       You know the rules!

     -I didn't let her come!

             What?!

    Babe, you can't be here.

   -I know you guys like beer,
        so I brought beer

      so you guys like me.
             Right?

-We can like beer without having
     to like you, Samantha.

      Samzy, get the beer!
             -Sorry.

     -See? Now we hate her.
        -Yeah, fuck her.

  -Don't we have an extra room?
           -Oh, yeah.

       We got all the room
          in the world.

      It's called outside!

       -The rules do state
  that during bicep bi-annuals,

           all females
     have to stay outside...

    where there is more room.

      -But I brought beer,

          and you guys
      stole my motor home!

   -Todd, you broke the rules.
     You got to go with her.

         -You can't let
     me go outside with her!

         She's gonna try
     and take my virginity.

       -No, I would never.

    -If I remember correctly,

    and I do, there's a tent
      in the shed out back.

      -Yep, there's a tent
          in the shed.

-The tent's located in the shed.

   -That's where the tent is.
          In the shed.

      -Tent's in the shed.
       Tent's in the shed.

       Tent's in the shed.

              -No!

      -What's it gonna be?

       Are you a Delta Bi
       or a Samantha guy?

       -What do you think?

      -Tent's in the shed.

   -Looks like you get a stay
      of execution, pledge.

       -I don't even want
    to look at you right now!

          You've ruined
   my l-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife!

    We're getting this tent,
     and we're going to bed!

           That's it!

        -Oh, that's fine!
          That's fine.

            -Babe...
     -We can just go to bed.

        -Yeah, I'm tired.

      -I didn't mean to get
         you kicked out.

            -Babe...
         -I am so sorry

     that I'm a girl, baby.
         -You should be!

    -Who needs the Delta Bis?

  I think they're just jealous
         of you anyway.

          -Babe, babe!

 -Yeah, you are the smartest bro
          in the frat.

    I mean, you've got career
    prospects, healthy gums,

 I mean, amazing bone structure.
   -Stop. Your hands are cold.

         -That tickles.
          -Your body is

        so fucking jacked
          and fertile!

 It's like your sperm count must
be in the billions or something.

            -Oh, oh!

             Babe...
    -I mean, those Delta Bis

should be getting on their knees
         to worship you.

  -Tell me more about my bros.

         -Oh. Found it.

              -Oh.

          Oh, Samantha.

            Oh, baby.

        -Stay on target.
            -Oh, Sam.

       -Eye on the prize!

  -These air holes you poked in
the condom aren't working, babe.

      -No, stay the course!

          -Little Todd
      still can't breathe.

       He looks like a --
  a dude jammed into something.

       -It's usually hard.

        -It normally is!

        -Does this help?

   -Yeah. Yeah, that's better.
          -Okay, good.

             -Okay.
     -You've got this, Todd!

      You are in the zone!

  You are in the home stretch!
            -Please!

 -You are killing it back there!
       -Don't look at me!

      -Ahh, I'm having sex.

    -Don't you quit now, boy!
       Don't you quit now!

     -Now -- now I lost it.

 -Put your Delta Bi seed in me!

           -My seed?!

              Aah!

       -Thank you, Toddy.

               Mm.

     -Should've pulled out.

    -How much further, Z.Q.?

      -Our journey will end
     when it ends, Sizzler.

       And once you beef,
       a whole new journey

         begins for you.

Oh!

          What's that?!
          -Tree noises.

              Aah!

           Oh. Oh, no!

               Oh!
      -Z.Q., are you okay?!

              -No!
          I'm not okay!

         Kick my camera
    in my general direction!

  This is an incredible scene!

 -I'm getting out of this thing.
              -No!

     -But I could save you!
             I just

  have to get out of this box!

      -Not until you beef!
            Sizzler!

          -I'm trapped!
          I'm trapped!

           -No! Ha ha!
         I'm on my way!

         I have a rope!

      Hang tight, Sizzler!
              -Aah!

Aah!

            Amazing!

          -Rainin' men.

     -Come on, Got to beef!

          Got to beef!

      I got to beef! Aaah!

              Aaah!

              Aaah!

              Aaah!

 -And the, uh, number-one reason

    why cops just can't catch
         a break, uh...

         My dad beat me,

  and now I sleep with my eyes
              open!

              -Boo!

            -God! No!

  -You can tell he's a virgin!

            Oranges!

        Oranges! Oranges!
        Get away from me!

       -Sminkle! Wake up!

-Number 6, please don't kill me!

       -It's just a dream!
   We've got to move this car,

  and I can't do it on my own.

      I need your muscles.
              -Oh.

  Well, why didn't you say so?

All I need is a hearty breakfast
           and, uh...

              Hey.

      The wolves cleaned up
        all the deadness.

  And they filled up the tires.

    Boy...those wolves are...

    ...getting pretty smart.

      -Just push, damn it!

        -Brace yourself,

     'cause you just bought
    yourself a one-way ticket

 to the motherfucking gun show!

     Fu-- Havin' a good time
        at the gun show!

        Havin' a good --

    Aah! Oh, those Dream Bros
          were right --

   I can't do anything right.

   -Look, here are the top 10
  reasons why Sminkle is great.

     10, he greets every day
          with a smile.

  9, he wants to help children.

    -I want to bang children!

      -8, he wants to bang
        children's minds.

    -No, it's not as catchy.
       No, it's too long.

      It's too thought-out.
       It's too involved.

 -7, he wants to bang children.

         -Bang 'em good.
    -Don't give up, Sminkle.

        We got to get you
        to the lake house

      so that you can solve
     Chico's orange crisis!

        -Virgin strength!

              -Ah!
    6, he's asleep right now

   yet still somehow pushing.

              Uh...

            I, uh...

    2, he's awake right now,

    and that's a good thing!

         1, he probably
     doesn't deserve to die.

              Yes!
              -Yes!

          -Oh, my God!
       Yes, yes, yes, yes!

         -Whoo-hoo-hoo!

            -Oh, no.

   -Oh, no. I forgot my keys!

              Aah!

          -Every year,
   thousands of idiots are --

             -Guys!

    -Hey, friend, come on in.

    It's nice, and it's warm.

   -Quit remembering your dead
 brother and jump in the water.

      -Brent, come on, man!

         You can do it!
             Brent!

    Oh, take off that shirt.

         You'll love it!

        -Come on in, bro.
        Get in the water.

         -In the water!
          -It's so wet!

              -Yay!

           You did it!

        Congrats, buddy.

 -We're having such a good time.

       -Aren't we, Brent?
             -Yeah.

         I guess we are.

              Yeah!

          -Told you so.

          -Nice catch.

             -Whoa!
            -Oh, no!

      -Daddy, no, don't go.

      I'm sorry I'm a girl.

         Daddy, no! No!

     No, I promise I'll have
         you a grandson.

    It'll make it all better!
              Wait.

       What's that, daddy?

  You -- you'll be right back?
            Oh, okay.

   I'll wait here on the stoop
            for you.

              Bye.

               Mm.

            Oh, Todd,
   I had the most wonderful --

          Aah! Aaaaaah!

             -Whoo!
              Yeah!

              -Shh!
              -Oh!

   Look, guys, Z.Q.'s overcome
      his fear of heights!

              -Wow!

      -Oh, my God! Torsos!

       -Hey! Todd is dead!
            Help me!

        -So, Z.Q.'s dead?

        Samantha shows up
        covered in blood?

 I knew she couldn't be trusted,
       but she's a killer!

Please let me in!

 I just got punched in the face,
    and my boyfriend's dead!

This weekend is not going at all
        how I planned it.

    -Brent, you get the door.

     Samzy, you played ball
       in college, right?

       -Starting pitcher,
       East Chico Rapiers.

       -Batter's up, bro.

     -Guys, I don't know --

   -We're killing the killer!

It's just like old times, Brock!
            Remember?

Go, Rapiers!

            -Please!

           -Just move.

   Your brother's more Rapier
      than you'll ever be.

       -Please let me in!

           -Who is it?
         -It's Samantha!

         -Samantha who?

       -Samantha Samantha!
           Let me in!

     I'm Todd's girlfriend!

 I've tried to bang all of you!

-Todd doesn't have a girlfriend.

 He's still discovering himself.

        -Just let me in.

             -Okay.

              -Ohh!

          -Go, Rapiers!

         -Wait a minute.
Samantha couldn't be Motherface.

      Todd told me she was
  on that Booze Cruise in Cabo

        when Brock died.

         Guys, Samantha
     couldn't be Motherface.

      Todd told me she was
      on that Booze Cruise

    in Cabo when Brock died.

             -Whoa!

           Motherface?
      -Motherface is dead!

      We killed her twice,
        Brock, remember?

  Rememb-- Br-Br-Broc-- Broc--

          Broc-- Broc--

          Broc-- Broc--
             Broc--

      -Ba-gawk! She's dead.

       Motherface is dead.
          -She's dead.

  But Samantha is here, alive,
        covered in blood!

  -We're all covered in blood!

        Are you guys daft
         or something?!

       Motherface is back!

        She killed Todd,
        she killed Z.Q.,

   and she killed my brother,
             Brock!

    -Samzy, throw another bat
             at him.

        -I'm out of bats.
             -Fine.

I'll defeat him using good looks
           and logic.

        You are stu-pid.

  -Brock, you always had a plan

   when these kinds of things
            happened.

     Brock, What's the plan?

  -Don't drag Brock into this!

         -Don't tell him
 where to drag my dead brother!

     I already lost him once
  when he joined the Delta Bis,

    and then you let him get
     murdered by Motherface

     right under your noses!

          -That's fine.
         You know what?

   I'm rescinding your pledge.

            -Oh, no!

          I don't care!

  I'm not even here to pledge!

      I'm here for Brock --

to find out what happened to him
      and avenge his death,

 not to bro out with you dudes!

        -You lied to us.
              -No.

       No, no, no, no, no.

         -I trusted you!

         -Who are you?!

    -New plan -- time to beat
         the shit out of

  dead Brock's living brother,
             Brent.

      -Brock has a brother?
       -I told you, Samzy.

          God damn it.
          -Oh, my God!

  You're little Brent Chirino!

 I have heard so much about you.

         You can -- Wow.
              Okay.

      So you can understand
       how meeting someone

that looks exactly like somebody
    that you thought was dead

     would be exceptionally
           confusing.

  -What the hell are you doing
  out of the beef box, pledge?!

           <i> -Amazing!</i>

         <i> -Rainin' men.</i>

        -Oh, God -- Z.Q.

             <i> -Aah!</i>
             -There!

     That's where I beefed.

        -Pause the tape.

            Enhance.

    I said enhance, damn you!

           Now squint.

          -Motherface!

              -Who?
           -I knew it.

              -Yes.
             -Whoa.

           -It's true.

           She's back.

  But I've been investigating,

  and I think I know who she is
      and how to stop her.

 I thought I could do it alone.

         But I need you.

      You're the only bros
          I have left.

          -Step aside,
 Brock's identical twin brother.

Let a real Delta Bi handle this.

    You see, after surviving
   two party massacres myself,

     I grew weary of relying
on Brock's plans to save us all.

 To wit, I created an identical
    robot duplicate of myself

  for one, singular purpose --
       to kill Motherface.

             -Weird.
     -It's up in the attic.

              -Oh!

               Oh!
           That's it!

             Robot!

          In the attic.

              -Oh!
             -Okay.

    Well, with that in mind,
 you bros just kick your feet up

    and let me and Robo-Samzy
     take care of this one.

 -I don't know if you should --
          -Just, uh...

 That's odd. There appears to be
    some kind of malfunction.

  I'll just do a quick check --
            -No! No!

   I was just thinking, maybe,
      if that doesn't work,

  then we should have a plan B.

I got this one.

      -Yeah, there he goes.

       -Secret door open.

     -And there he's going.

           Oh, Jesus.
          -Robo-Samzy?

          Robo-Samzy?!

       Oh, no! Robo-Samzy!

    You didn't try to dance,
            did you?!

       You beautiful fool!
      Who did this to you?!

        -It was...Bro...

       -What is going on?!

         Aah! Aah! Aah!

         Aah! Aah! Aah!

         Aah! Aah! Aah!

         Aah! Aah! Aah!

       Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

     -I don't like that guy.

           -Aah! Aah!

      -What is happening?!

     I had a plan this time!

       I watched you die!

             Twice!

              Hmm?

      -Why are you hitting
         yourself, huh?

        -What are you --
       I'm a little bitch!

       I'm a little bitch!

       I'm a little bitch!

   I'm a little bitch, bitch,
   bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch,

      bitch, bitch, bitch,
      bitch, bitch, bitch!

     -You killed my mother.

         And my sister.

          You at least
    deserve a tongue-lashing.

              -Aah!

            Aah! Aah!

            Aah! Aah!

            Aah! Aah!

Aah!

        -What? No tongue?

           -Call now,
 and we'll send you a second --

  Are you bored of the same --

No, no.
      Please. Please, God.

         Please. Oh, no.

        Oh, God, Candace.

Oh, God!

         Virgin...tears.

--Aah.

Ugh.

Ew.

       -You saved my life.
   -Well, yeah, you big dummy.

   I mean, you know, honestly,
    this is the longest time

         I've ever spent
      with another person,

      and I've never really
          had a friend,

   and no one's ever listened
    to my top 10 lists before

    or had such pretty hair,

 and when we were flying through
            the air,

       I really thought we
       had a moment there,

 and I honestly thought I could
    spend the rest of my life

     flying through the air
      next to this person!

     And I was honestly glad
   we didn't wear seat belts!

     You know, fuck safety!

      And I really thought
        that I lost you!

          -Oh, Sminkle.

          -Oh, Candace.

           -I'm sorry.

      -There's another guy,
          isn't there.

          Gosh darn it.
       I should've known.

        Classic Candace.

Nice work, officer.

              -Hey.

        Sorry I abandoned
         you back there.

     -That's okay, daddy --

I mean, Brent.
    Brent.

            I'm cold.

    Are we gonna die, Brent?

    -Hey, Sizzler, great job.

    Why don't you go fuck off
      for a sec, all right?

       -Sure. I'll go get
  my organic veggies upstairs.

    -Grab a big bag of dicks.
          I don't care.

              -Hey.

    -Brock meant a lot to me.

  And I thought, like a idiot,

  that maybe you'd be like him,

       and we could go on
   like nothing ever happened.

    But something did happen.

         You lied to me!

  -Turbeaux, you can trust me.

     We're in this together.
              -No!

  Brock planned all my workouts
             for me!

  We were supposed to do traps
    and lats the day he died!

         Now look at me!

  -If we do 10 sets of 20 reps
  on the lat pull-down machine,

   I swear, we will sculpt you
   the V-taper of your dreams.

        -You lied to me!

            -I swear,
 I will never lie to you again.

   -What if it's my birthday?

           You take me
to a quiet little bistro dinner.

       Nothing too fancy?

        And then you act
  like you "forgot your keys."

     Then the lights go out.

   Who turned out the lights?

   Then the lights go back on.

    All my friends are there.

    And you know what it is?

     It's a goddamn surprise
         birthday party!

  Garcon, bring out the fucking
  raspberry brown butter torte

  that reads "Happy 23rd B-Day,
            Turbeaux!

     Love your lying friend,

        the sack of shit
       that he is, Brent!"

      -I swear, I will ruin
      every surprise party

  that anyone ever throws you!

     -But I love surprises!

   -What's your problem, man?!

      -I have a hairy dick!

            -Wh-what?

      -You know how I hate
        little baby dogs

        and their little
      hairy baby dog dicks?

      -Yeah, I guess, yeah.

         -When I look at
   a little baby dog, Brent...

      I see the parts of me
          that I hate!

        I hate my little
      hairy baby dog dick!

       -That's cool, man.

    That's...That's normal...

 for us...to have...problems...

   with our -- with our dicks.

            -Really?

             -Sure.

           -All right.

           All right.

    Well, me and my fuzz rod,

         we're gonna...

      go down to the cellar
    and...get some more wood.

      All right. Good talk.

             -What?

           Who's been
    pillaging my veg stash?!

      What am I gonna eat?

    Aww. You're just hungry.
          That's cool.

      What's mine is yours,
         rabbit friend.

          No, I can't!
        I'm a vegetarian!

      Meat upsets my stom--

         Oh, n-o-o-o-o!

           -All right!

        One bullet? Cool.

               Oh!

     I'm not afraid of you.

   Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

          I'm a puppet!

              Aah!

           Oh, my God!

            Ohh! Ohh!

        I hate my little
      hairy baby dog dick!

      I have a hairy dick!

        Baby hairy dick!

        I hate my little
      hairy baby dog dick!

      I have a hairy dick!

        You're so small!

         -What was that?
        -Turbeaux's dead.

          -And Sizzler?

           -Honestly,
    I forgot who Sizzler was,

   but I should play it cool.

Let's split up and look for him.

            -Sizzler?

            -Sizzler?

            -Sizzler?

            -Sizzler?

            -Sizzler?

            -Sizzler?

            Sizzler?

            -Sizzler?

            -Sizzler?

          Oh! Sizzler?!

            -Sizzler?

            Sizzler?

            Sizzler?

            -Relzzis?

            -Relzzis?

            -Sizzler?

            -Relzzis?

            Relzzis?

            Sizzler?

            Relzzis?

            Relzzis?

            -Sizzler?

            -Sizzler?

      Oh, my God! Oh, God!

         -Whoa, Sizzler?

              Shit.

      Looks like it's just
         the two of us.

              -No.

        There's a third.

         -T-O-Double-D?
            -Mm-hmm.

    -It's the last Delta Bi.

    -We have Steve Guttenberg
       here in the studio

          to talk to us
    about his upcoming movie,

       "3 Men and a Baby."
          -Can't wait!

  See you after the late-night
         morning movie.

          -Stay tuned!
            -Sizzler?

     Oh, God! Todd Jr., no!

Fetus!

 -I wish you'd be more positive.

      -I've had a bad day.
            -Oh, no.

  Motherface got you guys, too.

      -Oh, you don't care.

 You don't even know our names.

       -Yea-- yeah, I do.

            -Name us.

          -Todd -- no.
           Turtleneck.

        Turtleneck bro...

          Flannel bro.

          -Lucky guess.

     Only 'cause we're named
        after our shirts.

 Can you even name one good time
       we've had together?

             -Yeah!

              -No.

            Aah! Ohh!

            Ohh, ohh!

      -You're alone, Brent.

 You never avenged your brother.

 You never solved your mystery.

       -Oh, you're wrong.

 I'm ready to avenge my brother
  because I solved my mystery.

 I know who you are, Motherface.

      You're Ronald Reagan.

       -No -- no, I'm not.

 -Think about it, Mr. President.

   The Dude Bros freshman-year
  prank deposed General Cortez.

    -Your heavy-metal hot-air
balloon did drive General Cortez

   from the Brazilian embassy.

      -So you could install
        a puppet dictator

        and turn the tide
       in Central America.

  Oh, with their powerful pecs
    and extreme athleticism,

          the Delta Bis
 were you personal Delta Force.

      -This is ridiculous.
        -Sophomore year,

     they sold arms to Iran,

      but that went south,
       didn't it, Ronnie?

   So you decommissioned them
 to a frat house in East Chico.

         How convenient.

      Oh, except you forgot
        about one thing.

       You can't turn off
  training like that, can you?

               No.
    Not like a light switch.

  -Part of me did die that day.

  -So, two days ago, when they
    brought down two planes,

      you got a sex change,
    you appointed an imposter

       to take your place
            in D.C.,

     and donned the face of
 Chico's most notorious killer.

      Admit it, Motherface.

      You are our nation's
         40th president.

        -Damn it, Brent.

        How did you know?

          -I solved it!

          Oh, damn it!

I really thought I had that one!

               Oh!

 I'm ready to avenge my brother,
           Motherface,

   because I know who you are.

          -Did you know
      about his worst fear?

      -Running out of beer?

     -You knew all kinds of
 personal information about us.

      -No babies! My seed!

              Aaah!

        -My fear is beef!

      And pork and chicken
    and all that gross stuff!

         -I told you --
      I hate handyman work.

              Aaah!

        -Z.Q.'s overcome
      his fear of heights!

              -Wow!
      -We never established

    he was afraid of heights.

         -Eh, who cares?
   This whole thing's a mess.

    -This is fucking stupid.
            -Guys...

           And that's
   because you're Turbeaux --

      the school therapist!

            Ow! Why?!

              -Why?

 Haven't you been investigating
       any of this shit?!

  Your brother murdered my mom
       and my twin sister!

     I swore that the reign
of terror of your kind was over.

    I swore that I would find

     the Delta Bis deepest,
         darkest fears,

  starting with your brothers,

  and use it to slaughter them!

     -Hey, my brother was --
     -Oh, shut the fuck up.

     I was their therapist!

    Oh, the things these guys
            told me.

       Did you know that,
         two months ago,

     Derek hit a 9-year-old
          with his car

       and then buried her
 under the football field, huh?

     And Samzy put Coca-Cola
  and Pop Rocks in the fuselage

    of the Challenger shuttle
           as a goof!

 -Hey, what about patient-doctor
        confidentiality?

  -Oh, the sense of entitlement
         on these bros!

            -Tai chi!

 -Why did you join their ranks,
             Brent?

  You could've ended this cycle
   of meaningless destruction.

     -I just wanted to have
        the feeling of...

       brotherhood again.

     I...I had a good time.

         -Oh, fuck you!

     What about sisterhood?!

  My sister was my best friend.

 None of you motherfuckers have
  any sense of goddamn empathy.

      They crashed a plane
       into an orphanage.

          An orphanage!

 -Well, I was behind the planes,
            not them.

    -You are just like Brock.

  Do you know why your brother

   went to a different college
            than you?

         -East Chico U.
 has an urban-development major.

 He wanted to be a city planner.

  -He told me he needed space.

    -N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

   -Not so motherfucking fast,
           Motherface!

            -Nedry?!
  -That's fucking right, bitch!

    -You're doing it, Nedry!
        You're swearing!

      -Looks like I fucking

   handicapped your advantage,
           Motherface.

    See, I've gained mastery
     over all these animals!

       Look at my beasts!

    I've forgiven the wolves
      that slayed my family

    and become their leader.

         You want to see
       some cold-ass shit?

             Ca-caw!

  This here is a motherfucking
           bald eagle,

   the most majestic creature
           in America,

    and I made him my bitch!

  And it's about to motherfuck
     your face, Motherface!

     Because you know, birds
     of a feather, flock --

            together.

             -Whoa!

            Tai ch--

       -What's the matter?

         All choked up?

  Use her inertia against her.

       -Is it really you?

        -It's really me.

           It's Brock.

             -Weird.

  I...thought you needed space.

   -Hey. We've had our space.

   And we'll never need space
             again,

       because I'll always
         be with you...

           within you.

        Yeah. You'll see.

          Oh, crumbles!

      Virgin sacrifice. Oh!

        Oh, if only I was
   a roly-poly bag of oranges!

   I'd bop myself on the nose

      and tumble and fumble
 right out of this tender trap.

       -Sminkle, it's me.

   Let's get you out of here.

        -You lied to me.

       You all lied to me.

 And the Dude Bros aren't really
   bags of oranges, are they?

        And every moment
     we spent in my bang bus

     meant nothing, did it.

      Well, fine, Candace.

        If dying a virgin
         is the only way

  I can save my beloved Chico,

     then I guess that's all
          I'm good for.

     -Not if I can help it.

      -What are you doing?

       -Saving your life.

   -She's too powerful, Brock.
         I let you down.

         -Hey, remember
      what I always say --

        if you face a foe
 you're afraid you can't defeat,

  you got to let your bros in.

        Let us in, Brent.

        Let us all...in.

   All along, Brent, you just
   needed to let you bros in.

           -I'm ready.

         Bros, enter me!

               Oh!

               Oh!

            Oh-ho-ho!

              Unh!
        -You're doing it.

              -Oh!

            Oh-ho-ho!

              Unh!

               Oh!

             -Whoa!
    We're not virgin anymore.

         I feel so free!

              -Ah!

               Oh!

          -I'll always
     be with you, Brent....

        inside your butt
       giving you powers.

            -Bye-bye.

 -And that's the number 1 reason
 why Candace and I are in love.

           -You fool!

   You had one simple destiny,
           Sminkle --

     to stop the Dude Bros,

     and you balls'd it up!

      Do you have any idea

how much work and taxpayer money
        went into this?!

        I learned Latin.

           And making
    all those blood candles?

           Jesus, I --
     I killed so many ducks.

          And Debra...
       made a lovely cake.

  I ate a goddamn nicoise salad

          to make room
      for this cocksucker,

and now I can't even look at it!

           And you --
   you said I could trust you!

 And you fall in love with<i> him?!</i>

     -Chief, you got a call

 from the Imperial Dark Majesty
           on line 1.

   -That's, uh -- that's Eric,
    and I have to take this.

    -Well, we did it, Candy!

  And all because you taught me
      to believe in myself.

       -Well, I don't want
     to take all the credit.

I mean, you did teach me a thing
        or two, as well.

      -Hey, I got a silly,
     crazy, little old idea.

   What say you and me become
     a boyfriend-girlfriend

      mystery-solving team,
    banging kids on the side?

         I already know
 what our first case will be --

 the Chico County Orange Crisis.

          -About that,
   I already cracked the case.

              -Wow.
     That was fucking fast.

 Where are your clues, partner?

     -I'm a bag of oranges.

             -What?

     -I'm a bag of oranges.

       -That's not a clue.
       That's not a clue.

     -Search your feelings.

     You know it to be true.

  -Bag of oranges, get in here!

      -Top 10 reasons magic
           isn't real.

           Number 10,
    I have prayed to a genie

         to take me away
   from my abusive home life,

     and it never showed up.

      Candace, please, no!

          Ew! Oh, gosh!

         But I love you!

        -If you love me,
  you know what you have to do.

             -I do.

 -Look, he's talking to that bag
        of oranges again.

       -Do it. Save Chico.

        -I will always...

            love you.

      N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

  <i> -I don't want to call things</i>
           <i> too early,</i>

    <i> but up here in the sky,</i>

         <i> it looks like</i>
     <i> Chico's orange crisis</i>

        <i> might be solved.</i>

             -Whoo!

          -Hi, my baby!

           -Sizzler?!
            -My baby!

            -Sizzler?
