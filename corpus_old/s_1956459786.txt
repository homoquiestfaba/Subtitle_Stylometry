[RHYTHMIC MUSIC]

Animal Instincts (1992)

My name is Joanne Cole,
the one who's in the news.

I don't know what to say.

FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
did you tell the truth?

What?

FEMALE SPEAKER: In the news,
did you tell the truth?

A portion of it.

FEMALE SPEAKER: I'd like you
to tell me the whole truth.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Mamma mia.

REPORTER (ON TV): And
scientists at Caltech

confirm there are still--

David, I'm still here.

I know, baby.

REPORTER (ON TV): --Fletcher
Ross, a candidate for mayor,

repeated his determination
to close a new strip

club known as the Pleasure
Dome, which opened

last month in his district.

We've got to say
enough is enough

when activity of this sort
infests our community.

The people are behind
me on this one.

But even if I didn't
receive a single vote,

I would eradicate this filth.

What a fraud.

What, honey?

Fletcher Ross.

The guy could run tours of
the strip joints in the city.

Anything for a
vote, hey, Fletch?


[PHONE RINGING]

David, don't.
They'll hang up.

Hey, baby, it
could be work, OK?

Please.

Hello?

Yeah, speaking.

I'll be right over.

Yeah, you betcha.

Hey, I'm sorry, baby.

Why does it have to
be every single night?

You never want to be with me.

Duty calls, Joanne.

You promised you'd
stay home tonight.

Hey, what would
you rather have--

me loafing around here or
maybe it would be nice to have

some money in the bank, OK?

You said you wouldn't
work nights any more.

Look, I've got a shitload of
pressure on me right now, OK?

Payments just went up
on the ex-wife's house.

This place is killing
me-- two cars.

Don't start with me, OK?

Why not?

You never finish with me.


Hey.

Why don't you take
a tranquilizer, OK?

Go to sleep.

I'll be back in a few hours.

David, I don't
want to go to sleep.

I want to feel you touch me.

I want to feel like
you still love me.

That's all I ever wanted.

I don't care about
the cars, the money.

I just want you to be with me.

I need you.

I know you do.

And I'll be back
in a few hours, OK?

JOANNE (VOICEOVER):
After I married David,

I didn't really have
any friends to turn to.

I'd always been sort of a loner.

My parents-- forget it.

I just had David.

FEMALE SPEAKER: What
about your parents?

What about them?

FEMALE SPEAKER: Did
you talk to them?

My parents just
couldn't be bothered.

Nothing I did ever pleased them.

They thought I
was a big mistake.

I just wanted them to love me.

FEMALE SPEAKER: Did you
begin to feel that nobody

loved you, including David?

David thought he
had to give me things.

That's how he showed his love.

He had to provide.

And when money
started getting tight,

he got frustrated and withdrawn.

Everything was about the money.

He just let it
tear him up inside.

Yeah, six grand.

Trade in my old
clunker, and I'm looking

at a shiny new convertible.

What do you need
a new car for, man?

You're married.
It's over for you.

Fuck you, Rod.


Look, I didn't need a
new car to get this.

What is it?

Remember the blonde
back at La Brea?

Yeah.

That's her number.

She gave it to me.

Her husband was in the next
room, for Christ's sakes.

I know, man.

You kept him busy for me.

I appreciate it.

See, what is it with you?

You've been my partner
less than a month,

and this is, what,
the third time?

You're a regular
horndog, Tennison.

That's what I like about
domestic disturbances.

You got all these sex-hungry
housewives out there.


You ought to try
it some time, man.

No, thank you.

I got all I can
handle back at home.

You got a bad attitude.

That's why we gotta take
advantage of this shit, man.

Someday I'm going to
write a book about it.

Yeah, well, write for TV.

That's where the bucks are.

See, there you go.

You got money on the brain.

You gotta lighten up.

Let's go back to the Bullhorn.

I got something
that's your speed.

What do we got
here, a titty bar?

Should have got it.

Maybe I'll get lucky and run
into Lamberti and Hernandez.

Friends of yours?

Hardly.

These guys are dirt
bags, all right?

They call themselves talent
agents for exotic dancers.

They deal in flesh and drugs.

Recruit young girls, get
them high, abuse them,

turn them into hookers.

Ecstasy is their drug of
choice, biggest dealers around.

I have a dream.

It's to bust these
guys big time.

[BARROOM ROCK MUSIC]


I think they ought to have a
Special Olympics for this-- all

these strippers, you know?

Can you imagine?

These gorgeous pieces
of ass from all

around the world together in
one big gigantic coliseum?

You might have a problem
getting those on a cereal box.

Ah, a sense of humor
from the man of stone.

Hard as a rock.

Well, my old
friend David Cole.

At your service.

Officer Tennison,
my new partner.

William Lamberti.

I always like
to see cops here.

My girls, they love
men in uniform.

Can I offer you a drink?

Well, no.

Ginger ale?

Nah.

I'll just take the
liquor license.

Look, I don't have to put
up with this fucking bullshit.

You guys have been
coming here for years,

and you're usually the last
people to leave at night.

Strictly in the
line of duty, sir.

Yeah, sure.

Strictly in the line
of the fact that I

got the best tits in town.

Hey, kid.

You got an honest face.

Don't let his
hypocrisy get to you.

This is a legitimate business.

Take this girl here.

Three years of ballet,
one year in Vegas.

Four months, county jail.
Booked her myself.

Yeah, well, I'm a nice guy.

I'm taking care of her,
giving her a break.

I can afford to.

I can afford to do
almost anything.

Is that the license, sir?

Well, you know, I don't
really own this place.

This is the owner here.

He wants to see
your liquor license.

What do we got up here?

Oh, nothing.

Just an odd room.

We have weddings, bar
mitzvahs, policemen's balls.

You know, national parties.

You can come to one of them.

Yeah, so why don't
you take that over

to your friend, Fletcher Ross.

You do know that
asshole, don't you?

Mr. Ross has the city's
best interests at heart,

if that's what you mean.

Yeah, well, he'd be
right here right now

sticking a 10-spot
up that chick's ass

if he wasn't running for mayor.

And you know it.

He sent you, didn't he?

Haven't seen him in months.

Well, when you do see
him, why don't you tell him,

if he touches this
place, I will get

every hooker, every
stripper, every pimp

to register to vote and kick him
out of this fucking mayor race.

It shouldn't be
too hard, Bill.

Every one of them
is on your payroll.

And we know it.

Guillermo!

LAMBERTI: Yeah.

How's business?

Number one and still growing.

You sent for the cops?
No.

No, they came for the girls.

You know our reputation.

Listen, I want this
place drug free tonight.

Totally.
You don't have to worry.

Everybody here knows
I'm a hell of a lot

tougher than the fucking DEA.


I got something special
for you upstairs.

Guillermo, [SPANISH].

Yeah.

Appreciate you.

Hiya, Tiger.

This do you?

Oh, yeah.

Anything for a friend.

Hasta la vista, mi amigo.

Vaya con Dios.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Can you believe that
asshole, Lamberti?

Yeah.

That prick probably makes
more money in a month

than I'll see in my lifetime.

Tell me something, David.

When you walk into
a place like that,

are you thinking to yourself,
why the fuck am I married?

No, because Joanne
is worth 10 of them.

10?

That's pretty incredible.

So is she, pal.

I wonder what
she says about you.

She says I'm all she needs.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
Let's talk about Primac.

JOANNE (VOICEOVER): That
brings back a lot of memories.

FEMALE SPEAKER

like Primac is one
of the most important

elements of your story.

JOANNE (VOICEOVER): At first.

I was taking it because
I was depressed.

The main thing it
did was loosen me up.

FEMALE SPEAKER:
Can you elaborate?

I thought about having
sex with a lot of guys a lot

of different ways.

I thought about seducing a room
full of prim guys, like judges

and lawyers and doctors, and
they couldn't resist my charms.

And they turned into animals.

Not literally, but
wild sex creatures.

And they'd start
taking me by force

and passing me around
from man to man.

And, uh-- I thought about
seducing a young guy who's

never had sex
before, and I'd just

have to teach him everything.

And I thought about sex with a
beautiful woman and couples--

you know, sex all the time.

I couldn't stop
thinking about it.


COP: Frances, why don't
you just shut up, OK?

Come on.

Tom, you know I'd
do it good for you.

I make you feel so good.
God.

Shut up and you'll be
out of here in an hour.

An hour is plenty
of time for us.

Let's get up there.

Imagine being couped up
with her for five minutes.

It's just right
up here, honey.

Right this way.

TENNISON: Quite a prize, huh?

Yeah, a booby prize.

FRANCES: (MOANING) Yeah.

Oh, god.

Yeah, baby.

Baby.

God, right there.

Just like that.

Oh.

Oh, yeah.

Oh!

Oh, god.

Yeah.

Yeah, you know what to do.

Just like that.

Oh, god.

Oh, yeah.

I met David a year ago.

It was a Tuesday.

I was driving to work.

I had this shift at
this cocktail lounge.

I was late, so I
guess I was speeding.

He pulled me over, and he
gave me a traffic ticket.

A week later, he paid my
fine, he left his wife,

and that was that.

The first few months,
David was incredible.

I had never had a
man treat me so well.

It was like we were one person.

When the money got tight,
we started having problems.

He was always worried about
being able to pay the bills.

The mortgage on the house,
it was way too high.

So he worked more.

We had less time together.

I made up this
total fantasy life.

I made up all these men
who paid attention to me.

FEMALE SPEAKER:
When did that end?

It didn't.

And so, the
relationship got worse.

So I decided I was going to
make David pay attention to me

like he did when we
were first together.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Joanne!

REPORTER (ON TV):
Councilman Fletcher Ross

officiated in groundbreaking
ceremonies for the Angelico

Shelter for Abused Children.

Ross described the shelter as
one more facet of his Clean

Up Our City campaign.

Meanwhile, Ross has
been gaining voter

support throughout the city.

Polls show him leading
by a narrow margin

in many areas thought to be
strongholds of Mayor Garibaldi.


Hi.

Hey, kid.

I thought you were asleep.

I waited up.

What do you think?

I think you look good.

I thought you might like it.


I like it a lot.

But not now, honey.

Why?

Because I'm tired.

And, uh-- I gotta get a few
things straight with myself.

And the god damn
television is out.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

FEMALE SPEAKER: You
must have felt rejected.

He was really withdrawn.

I thought that he
was unhappy with me

and that he had
grown tired of me.

I didn't know that we were on
the verge of a breakthrough

in our relationship.

I kept going over every moment.

Where had I gone wrong?

What had I done that
made him lose interest?

[MUSIC PLAYING]


Who is it?

Intercontinental Cable.

You reported a problem?

Do you need to come inside?

Yeah, I need to check all the
connections, inside and out.

Do you want
something to drink?

Uh, no, thanks.

Are you sure?

If it's not too much trouble.

No trouble at all.

So what do you got?

What would you like?

What's your husband drink?

Beer, I guess.

So, what'll it be?

He's a cop?

That's right.

A boy's fantasy come true.

So he's always gone,
fighting crime.

That sounds dangerous.

I like danger.

I, uh--

I'm married.
We have a lot in common.

[MUSIC PLAYING]



[CONTINUED MOANING]

Oh, God!

Yes!
Oh!

So, did he fix the problem?
I'm sorry.

It'll never happen again.

I swear.
I'm sorry.

JOANNE (VOICEOVER):
That's how I found out.

He liked to watch.

That's what really
turned him on.

That was the secret.

Watching me have
sex with other men,

doing everything
nasty with them--

he loved it all.

That's how it all got started.

FEMALE SPEAKER: Whose
idea was the ad?

Yours or his?

Mine, I think.

I'd said it as a joke,
but David was all for it.

Beautiful young woman seeks
generous, successful executive

for very discreet
evening interludes.

I'd like that to
run indefinitely.

You can bill it to my home.

You have my address, don't you?

JOANNE (VOICEOVER): I want you
to know, it wasn't the money,

ever.

It was like therapy
for both of us.

I know this is going to sound
strange to a lot of people,

but it saved our marriage.

And we were two people who
loved each other very much.

We still do.

We have power.
Aha!

Smile for me, baby.

Mm-hmm.

Hi!


All right.

How about parting those lips?
Yeah.

Joanne, you are one sexy woman.



Wow.

You look fantastic.

I'm nervous.

Yeah, me too.

Are you sure you want to go
through with this, Joanne?

So enjoy yourself.

And remember, I'm
right in the next room.

OK.

I think he's here.

I love you.

Hi.
Ken?

Court went a little
longer than I expected.

Come on in.
This is for you.

Thank you.

What a nice choice.

Well, I only pay for the best.

You're a lawyer?

You could say that.

What would you say?

I guess I would say
I'm an assistant DA.

I'm impressed.

Well, some girls find
my position intimidating.

Come on, a sexy guy like you?

Do you have some
glasses for this?

Wouldn't you be more
comfortable in the bedroom?

Actually, if you
don't mind, Joanne--

do you mind if we
just talk for a while?

You don't understand
the pressure.

You have no idea.

I've been in the DA's
office for six years.

I mean, the bullshit
you gotta put up with.

This is a really
nice place you have.

You have the sexiest
voice I have ever heard.

Do I?

They say that intelligence is
an aphrodisiac to some people.

Do you have this
effect on everyone?

I wish.

I interrupted.

You were talking about your job.
Job?

Oh.

The usual.

Office politics, egos,
everybody's own ambitions--

meaningless stuff.
Don't stop.

How long have you
been doing this?

Long enough to know how to
make a lawyer drop his briefs.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


Thank you.


Did you enjoy that?

Just now?
No.

I know you enjoyed it now.

I mean before.
Before?

Before was incredible.

Every time you touched him,
I swear, I could feel it.

Me too.

Especially when he was
licking inside my thigh.

How is it different
from you and me?

You really want to know?

Yeah, Mrs. Cole.

I really want to know.

He was totally unselfish.

He really got into
how I felt. He

kept touching me
and stroking me,

till I thought I was
going to explode.

It's weird, but it was all
about making me feel good.

Maybe he came here
tonight to prove he

could make someone else happy.

Yeah.

Or maybe he was just
looking to get laid.

JOANNE (VOICEOVER): We really
accepted each other for what

we were, and that was great.

The two of us were together,
completely together.

FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, not
exactly just the two of you.

How many others were
there in the beginning?

At first it was
one or two a week.

Almost all of them
were married, all

these lonely guys
looking for something

more than they got at home--

the same thing I wanted.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Kiss me, baby.



Come in.

Nice to meet you.

Thanks for having us.

Pleasure.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


Hi.

[MUSIC PLAYING]



[DOOR CLOSING]

Mailman.

Interesting free sample.


You got it.

Sprechen sie Deutsch?

What?

I said, do you
speak any German?

No.

I never went to
college or anything.

I wanted to, but
my parents didn't

want to waste their money.

Hm.

You've been denied so many
wonderful things, Joanne.

I could buy you a palace.

Do you know that?

You could leave this.

You'd never have to
worry about money again.

That's very sweet, Ingrid.

But I like it here.

Why do you do this,
sleep with just anybody?

So I can meet nice
people like you.

I wouldn't do it if
I didn't want to.

JOANNE (VOICEOVER): I really
felt sorry for Ingrid.

I knew that she was me if I
hadn't found a way to get out.

But I found a way to be happy.

And David loved me.

We could have gone on like
that for the rest of our lives.

[BARROOM ROCK MUSIC]

Yeah, David.

William Lamberti here.

Listen, uh-- I need
your help, guy.

I'm under a lot of heat.

This guy Fletcher Ross sent
over some jerk yesterday.

DAVID (ON PHONE): So what?

Well, so I need you
to get him off my back.

Look, I know how you like
to watch my girls dance.

I'm a generous man when
it comes to favors.

I'm not asking
for anything free.

I don't need
anything from you.

So go screw yourself.

What was that all about?

Eh, nothing.

Just some lunatic.

Can you believe these
bastards want to cut our pay?

Like we don't have enough
to put up with around here?

Hey, it happens every year.

It's just talk.

We put our lives on the line
every day for these assholes,

and look what we get back, huh?

Hey, hey, hey, man--

I should have gone to medical
school like I wanted to.

It's only money.

I thought all you
cared about was money.

Rod, there's some things
in life money just can't buy.

Like what?

Love.

And the perfect woman.

Come on in.
Thanks.

You're a friend
of Judge Keaton's?

Yes.

He was right about you.

You're a lawyer?

Me? No, I'm a doctor.

JOANNE: Really? What kind?

MAN: I'm a heart specialist.

A heart specialist?

I've heard that a glass of wine
every night keeps you healthy.

Is that true?
Sure.

Here's to our health.

You want the lights on or off?

Any way you want them.

I think we'll keep them on.

I love doctors.

They always take such
good care of themselves.

They're always in
such great shape.

I spend a lot of
money keeping in shape.

I don't think so.

There's some things
money just can't buy.


That's funny?

My partner was saying
the same thing today.


Your partner?

I didn't know
doctors had partners.

I meant my nurse.

Oh, your nurse.
She's your partner?

Oh, well.

Then I guess we'll just have to
bring her along too next time.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


Let me pull you
up a deck chair.

You tired our what?

You got that one right.

What's Officer "I'm
not getting paid"

shit-grinning for?

Well, it's not money,
so you figure it out.

Oh, yeah.

The big date.

So how was she?

The question is,
how wasn't she?

So does that
mean she was good?

Good?
Oh, man.

She-- she did everything.

There's not one
thing she didn't do.

You're full of crap.

She was probably 55
with loads of kids.

Let me tell you
something, partner.

She did things that your
wife would never, ever do.


So why don't you
tell me about it?

Well, it was wild.

It lasted for hours.

JOANNE (VOICEOVER): Rod was a
great partner for both of us.

FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
And David didn't mind?

No.

FEMALE SPEAKER: Did he
ever get tired of watching?

Not really.

But after a while, he
wanted me to watch with him,

so we could make love
in front of the screen.

And basically, he wanted
to do what we saw.

I would be the
woman on the screen,

and he would be the man--

or whoever-- and that
way we could share

the benefits of our education.

I'll be there
as soon as I can.

Hm?

Oh, just make sure the tabs
on the tape aren't broken.

And press Play and Record.

Good.

See you later, baby.

Forget it, Dave.

I never met a woman
who could work a VCR.

This is no ordinary woman.


[DOOR CLOSING]

If people don't
lock their doors,

I guess they want
you to come in.

I didn't know it was unlocked.

Are you who I think you are?

You expecting somebody else?

No.

Then I'm the one.

I'm sorry.

Can you tell me your name again?

It's not the name but the
money that matters, right?

My money is just as
good as anybody else's.

Let me fix you a drink.

What can I get you?

Let's go see what we have.

You already have what I want.


We're wasting time.

do you know what this is?
No.

Take it out.

I said take it out.


No, no, no.

Hold your arms back.

No, wait a minute.
No, no.

Sh.
Oh.

Beautiful, young woman, seeking
generous, successful executive

for very discreet
evening interludes.

See?

That's not so bad.

Do you want to get any tighter?

No.

No, I didn't think so.

Close your eyes.

This way you'll feel it better.


All right, drop it.
Get off the bed.

All right, Officer.

Wait, wait.

I didn't do nothing, Officer.

David.

This lady invited me here.

Has he done anything to you?

No.

Are you sure?

I just want him to go.

So this lady's
your girlfriend?

Or is it your wife?

Just get the fuck outta here.

You don't know what
you're missing, honey.

You piece of shit.


OK.

That night really scared me.

Up until then, it had
been people I liked,

civilized people--

certainly nobody I
had to be afraid of.

David knew that things would
never be the same after that.

He tried to pretend that
things would go back to normal,

but he knew better.

One thing I know is talent.

Six months, a year,
you'll be a headliner.

[SPEAKING SPANISH]

Um, Barbara, get lost.
Business.

Jesus.

I saw a friend
of yours tonight.

I think he could help us.

LAMBERTI (ON MACHINE):
Hey, Officer.

It's William-- you
know, William Tell?

Or William not tell,
if you're lucky, huh?

Hey, only fooling.

It's Lamberti.

Boy, have I got a
great deal for you.

So give us a call here.

I'd love to talk to you
real soon, while this is

all fresh in everybody's mind.

You know what I mean?

Ciao, baby.


So who's the guy
Lamberti who called?

You heard that one, huh?

Mm-hmm.

The guy's nobody.

Scum.

Forget it.

What was that weird
message all about?

Nothing I can't handle.

Are you into politics, or
you just like my campaign?

Well, I like what
you do for women.

And looking around the office, I
see that you hire mostly women.

I do what I can.

I believe that, um--

politicians can
make a difference.

And they're not
out for themselves

how everybody says they are.

Well, maybe we can
use you a little more.

Well, feel free
to call me any time.

And overtime is no problem.

Good.

Sometimes I do need
extra help at night.

Oh.

Sorry, Fletch.

I didn't know if
anyone was here.

Hello, David.

How you been?

Diane, give me a cup of
coffee, will you, please?

Black.

Excuse me, David.

Business as usual, eh, boss?

You gotta keep
the followers happy.

Especially around
Leischentap, huh?

Yeah, those lemmings too.

Hey, David, I'm on kind
of a tight schedule.

What can I do for you?

Actually, Fletcher,
I think it's

something I can do for you.

Really?

The guys and me
have been talking,

and we decided, you know, you've
done some real good things

for the force over the years.

And, uh, we'd sure like to
see you become the next mayor.

I can use all the
support I can get.

So we want to start
helping you close down

some of them damn strip clubs.

Get in there, look
for violations,

make it real difficult for the
customers to enjoy themselves,

you know?

What's the catch?

A word about pay cuts.

Don't worry, David.

There'll be no pay cuts.

Here's your coffee, sir.

Thank you.

Diane, there are some
folders in the Goober

account in the outer office.

Would you get those
for me, please?

Yes.

You sure can pick them.

You still married?

Yeah.

I heard you got married again.

Yeah.

You don't seem too
thrilled about it.

No, it's OK.

It's a good arrangement.

But there are some
things in life

you gotta leave home to get,
if you know what I mean.

Yeah.

Tell me about it.

Heck, I was with
some girl last night.

I gotta tell you.

You know I've always had a
weakness for beautiful women,

but this one was flawless.

But I should push out.

Hey, wait a minute.

Tell me about her.

Oh, what?

The wife?

No, dickhead.

The girl last night.

Oh.

Well, it's the damnedest thing.

I saw about it in
a newspaper, an ad.

What, an outcall service?

No, no.

This is a freelance situation.

Very exclusive.


OK.

Can we just get
serious for a second?

Listen.

Everything can come off
tonight except the mask.

Why?

I don't want to wear it.

I'll feel silly.

And I don't want
your face on the tape.

He didn't say anything
to me about wearing a mask.

No, because this is my idea.

Oh, I see.

This is for some
friend of yours, right?

Some cop so he gets to
show it to all his friends.

No, Joanne.

Then I want to know
what this is all about.

This is not just
about us anymore,

not since the other night.

It's for our protection.

It's a one-time deal.

And then our lives are
going back to normal.

Tell me what's going on.

Let's all just have fun, OK?

I'm your wife.

Trust me, baby.

I know how the world works,
and I know what I'm doing.

Come feel the sheets.

What's with the mask?

I'm your fantasy.

Every woman you've ever wanted,
every woman you couldn't have.

I've had every
woman I ever wanted.

Then go home.

You don't need me.

What the fuck are you--

FLETCHER: You don't
know who I am, do you?

Not so far.

Yeah, I don't
know who you are.

We have all the same friends.

Do we?

I'm a pretty
important man, lady.

What makes you so important?

I keep this whole
damn city running

smoothly, keep all
the women like you

in the dark, away from all the--

Son of a bitch.

You might even
say I am the system.

Well, you know
what I always say?

Fuck the system.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

We've got you, Fletch.

Hey, great call.
Fucking great.

I tell you, just great.

And plenty of close-ups.

Yeah.
I love it.

Yeah, you know what I feel?

I feel, uh-- vindicated.

I thought you would.

You know how I see it.

There's two things that
make the world go round.

One is sex, the other is money.

Now, we're in the same
business, you and me.

And-- and your wife.

We got the same
animal instincts,

you know what I mean?

Well, there's two kinds of
animals, the ones that eat

and the ones that get eaten.


You know what I want to see?

I want to see Fletcher
Ross mauled and then eaten.


LAMBERTI: Can you dig it?

You're getting
ahead of yourself.

First we've got
to discuss terms.

Terms?

What are you talking
about, terms?

The tape's yours for 50
grand in cash by Friday.

What, are you nuts?

I thought I was talking
to a reasonable man.

Where the fuck do
you think I'm going

to get a hold of 50 grand?

You got connections.

Hey, why should I give
you a god damn nickel?

It's your ass
that's on the line.

All I gotta do is take
this tape to the cops.

And I know plenty of cops.

Yeah, me too.

And that got me thinking.

I mean, I've been on the
force, what, seven years?

Seven years without
one reprimand.

So who they gonna
believe, you or me?

You got any proof?

Yeah!

I got the ad.

That don't mean shit.
Oh, yeah.

You got the word of
Imelcho Hernandez.

But I bet you 50
grand you couldn't

get that twisted son of a bitch
anywhere near a police station.

Stay in touch, huh?

[DOOR CLOSING]

Don't you think you should
tell me what's going on?

Try your tea.

Tell me if I made it too strong.

Are you blackmailing
Fletcher Ross?

Personally?

No.

But if it suits our
purposes to help one

of his enemies, then who cares?

The guy's a first-class prick.

David.

Joanne, you're looking
at a good clean cop, OK?

Nobody puts the screws on me.

On us.

Just turning the tables, OK?

I don't know.

In fact, I wouldn't worry
about it if I were you,

because it's all taken care of.

Rather neat little piece
of work on my part.

Open wide.

Beautiful.

I had my doubts.

I trusted David to
work things out.

It was beyond his control.

Lamberti was as
determined to keep

himself in action as we were.

As a policeman, David
should have known.

If you bring the
streets into your home,

you can't control
what's going to happen.

[BARROOM ROCK MUSIC]

Uh, Imelcho.

I hate to interrupt
you, campanero,

but I've got a little
business problem that

really has to be taken care of.

Talk.

It's about that cop.

You know, Cole.

What about him?

Well, he wants--

he wants 50 grand for the tape.

I, uh-- I don't see how
I got a choice, huh?

No.

Well, um-- the thing
is, buddy, I'm, uh--

gonna have to ask
you for a loan.

No problem.

Hey, that's-- that's not
what I was talking about.

It's cheaper this way.

OK.

Thanks, buddy.

What if he changes his mind?

He's a businessman.

He'll take the easy way out.

What about Ross?

Fletcher is no fool.

He'll find some new
cause to focus in on.

[CAR ARRIVING]

Someone's here.

OK.

It's that freakin' dyke.

Let me talk to her.

Then get rid of her quick.


INGRID: Joanne, it's Ingrid.

Ingrid, what is it?

Please, darling, I
have to talk to you.

It's very important.

I can't talk to you, not now.

You have to leave.

But I tried calling.

Look, I have tickets.

I'm taking you to France.

I've got everything planned.

You don't have to
worry about a thing.

Ingrid, I can't leave.
Not now.

Oh, but I'll buy you clothes.

I'll take care of you.

I can't.

But I love you.

Ingrid, no.

Ingrid, guess what.

We're not interested in
your fucking problem.

David, what do you
think you're doing?

This is an emergency.

Please help me.

I saw a man at the
house with my friend.

He's got a gun.

Yes.

650 Paloma Avenue in--

Woodland Hills.

Yes.

Thank you.

Where the hell was
she going to take you?

France.


That's got to be him.

OK, let him in.

Just make sure he's
alone, all right?


Hey.

David.

Dave.

Yeah.

Glad you could make it.

You got all of it?
Every cent.

Well, I guess you're the girl
that started all the fuss.

Hello.

I understand you're going
to become a big video star.


Unlock the case, Lamberti.

Aren't you going
to offer me a drink?

Just open the god damn case.

Ah, David.

If we're going to
be partners, you've

got to learn to trust me.

Feast your eyes.

OK.

Fix the--

Oh!

Surprise.

Surprise, surprise.

Just pull the gun out of your
back and throw it over there.

Do it.
Don't touch her.

It's right here.

You watching?

It's going down.

It's down.

Now give me the tape.

And David, there
better be a tape.

Of course there's
a fucking videotape.

All right.

Put it in the briefcase
with your 50 grand.

You snake.

Money?


Stop it right now!

Stop it!
Freeze!

Don't shoot.

Don't shoot.
He's my partner.

What the fuck's
going on here, David?

That maniac broke
into my house.

What?

This is your house?

He was after my wife.
Your wife?

He was going to kill me, Rod.
Yeah.

Why don't you tell them
about the blackmail scam,

tell them about the
videotapes with your wife

making it with all of her,
uh, gentlemen friends.

Let's talk about this
at the station, huh?

Yeah.

If I talk, I tell
them everything.

You hear me?

Then that's how it
goes down, partner.

Let's go.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Do you like the, uh--
uh-oh.

FEMALE SPEAKER: And how
did you feel when the media

got hold of your story?

I didn't realize I
was such a big deal.

I didn't know our story would
attract so much attention.

I wasn't prepared for any of it.

FEMALE SPEAKER: And
from what I hear,

there are dozens of
public and private figures

that would do just
about anything

to keep their name out of it.

I wouldn't know
anything about that.

What's the status of the
cold case now, Mr. Craven?

I can't comment about
that at this time.

Our office is not
ready to release

any information about
the case till there's

been a full review.

What can you tell us
about the videotapes?

I can't comment.

But the people who
have seen the tapes

have identified many
of the people involved.

What are you saying about that?

I, uh-- can't comment.

Well, what about
Fletcher Ross?

Judge Keaton?

Members of the
police department?

No comment.
What about the black book?

No comment.

Mr. Craven, these people
are witnesses to a crime.

And under state law, their
names have to be made public.

Are you aware of that?

Wait a minute.

What crime?

Mr. Van Horn, as
the Coles' attorney,

should be well
aware of the charges

being brought against them--
prostitution and extortion.

There is no
prostitution, no extortion,

no crime of any kind.

What about the videotapes?

OK, I'll come to that.

What about the black book?

I'll answer all
your questions.

Just give me a chance
to tell the truth.

What has been characterized as
a crime perpetrated by the Coles

is actually a tragedy.

What has been
called perverseness

is, underneath all
the tar and feathers,

really a love story,
pure and simple.

What we have here is a loving
couple, compatible in every way

except in the bedroom.

Joanne Cole suffers from
excessive sexual desires,

nymphomania, a
medical condition,

induced and exacerbated by
the use of the drug Primac,

which was prescribed to
her by a medical doctor.

Because of the deep love
that this couple felt for one

another, they dealt
with this blow

to their marital stability
in a sane and rational way,

accommodation.

If this had been
a wasting illness,

David Cole would be praised for
supporting his wife's needs.

He would have been
called a hero,

and she would have been a saint.

She took her treatment, had
therapy, in a safe environment,

a clinical environment,
entirely under the supervision

of her husband.

They needed and
depended on one another

because they loved each other.

There's a black book
with names and dates

and dollar amounts,
heaps of videos

of judges, politicians,
and lawyers

in bed with your client.

How does all this square
with your therapy defense?

These other people, their
names, their prestige,

were irrelevant to the Coles.

The camera was David's way of
assessing his wife's condition.

It was as clinical as
an X-ray or an MRI.

Look, I hope that everybody
who hears the Coles' story

will recognize the
commonality of it

and perhaps related it to
travails in their own lives.

Then I think the public
will react generously--

not just with sympathy
but with understanding.

Mr. Van Horn--

Mr. Van Horn, would
you like to comment?

They sell T-shirts
with your picture on it,

you've been on radio
shows, you've been

on national television--
you're a celebrity now.

It's incredible, isn't it?

Now that you've
accepted the plea bargain,

are you going to put
all this behind you?

No.

I think it will be kept
alive for a long time.

FEMALE SPEAKER: Why?

Because I think
it fulfills a need.

I think a lot of people would
like to experience my story

firsthand, but they can't.

Or they won't.

And so the more details
they hear, the more real

the experience becomes to them.

What about the videotapes?

Did Fletcher Ross's
resignation and withdrawal

from the mayor's race have
anything to do with you?

All I know is what his
statement said, that he had

some sort of medical problem.

Beyond that, I wouldn't presume
to comment on his motives.

So what are your plans?

Our plans?

We've had a lot of nice offers.

I think we're going to go
to Barbados for a while.

I think we'll work things out
on the beach, have some fun.

You're welcome to join
us, if you'd like.


Well, if you had a chance
to do it all over again,

would you do it again?

I'd leave out a few things.

But overall, sure.

I got what I always
wanted, didn't I?

Which was?

Love.

Well, I guess that sums it up.

Is there anything else
you wanted to say?

Yeah.

Hi, Mom and Dad,
if you're watching.
