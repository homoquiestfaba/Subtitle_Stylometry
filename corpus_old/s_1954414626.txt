(Snoring continues)

(Alarm beeping)

What the...

Shit, fuck.

Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck...

(Alarm beeping)

Â¶Â¶

<i>(man on TV)</i>
<i>Looking for homemade,</i>
<i>fresh-baked goods?</i>

<i>Come to Terry's country
bake shop in red hook.</i>

<i>Home of "family circle's"
magazine...</i>

(Man on TV)
<i>With it's stunning natural</i>
<i>beauty,</i>

<i>Fiji is the ideal holiday
tropical paradise for couples.</i>

<i>Well, Dave,
while we didn't get</i>

<i>the white Christmas we were
hoping for,</i>

<i>mother nature may have
a few tricks up her sleeve.</i>

<i>We're getting forecasts</i>

<i>of a hurricane-force blizzard
coming tonight...</i>

Oh, Megan,
right where I left you.

How adorable.
You caught me red-handed.

I'm just...
I'm such a sucker

for the classic American novel.

Bad day?
No, I'm just exhausted.

Yeah, I know,
me too, right?

Oof...

Maybe it's time...
To get a job.

You're telling me...

Yes, I am.

I look for fulfilling
work all the time.

I just happen to be taking a
break whenever you're around.

It's like studying when
mom is watching.

Did you talk to your
parents about the lease?

Because the deadline's
on the first

and Cedric is willing
to take over if you...

yeah, no, I haven't made
a decision on that

yet, per se...

How did you not
make a decision yet?

I mean, what did you do today?

What did you do this week?

I did Christmas.

And I also started
online dating.

Seriously?

Ah!

Â¶Â¶

Yes, yeah, shut up.

No, I'm proud.

Meet anyone?

I said, started.

I'm not a machine.

Oh, oh, and, um, I also
really like that idea

of going Dutch
on principle except,

you know, I don't have any money

so it's kind of more
of an intellectual exercise.

Hey, whoa, where are you going?

You just got home.
Cedric's friend
is having this

birthday thing at this bar.

So then you're not
cooking dinner?

No... yeah.

Do you want to come?

Well, it kind of depends
on the cake situation.

Well, the birthday boy
is single.

And he's not
the brightest but he's pretty,

so he's perfect for
a one-night stand.

I don't know.

Do you think
I'm ready?
Who cares?

I'm ready for you to be ready.

I mean seriously,
how long has it been?

Aren't you horny?

Now see, I knew you two
little freaks be having

these type of conversations
when I'm not around.

I knew it,
especially you.

Hi, Cedric.
I knew it,
I caught you.

Well, yes, no, I'm horny
but I'm also...

Somewhat lazy, sometimes.

So the two counteract,
like dueling wizards...

not anymore.

Tonight is the night.
Faiza's setting me up.

I'm thinking Ben.

I like that,
that's cool.

Ben.

Whoop.

Â¶Â¶

Hello.
Hi.

What's up?

ID please.
I'm a girl.

Uh, no, I'm sorry,
you look kinda young.

Take it like a compliment,
all right?

Shit!
How did you lose
your ID again?

You don't go anywhere.

Okay, wait, look,
I am old enough, I swear.

Do you see that,
right there?

It moves.
Oh my God, Megan.

Hey, ID.

Oh, shit.

Awkward.

Hey.

I heard you're doing good.

From who?

I don't know,
I just...

Said that to be nice.

Oh...

Chris, I think this girl's
trying to get by you.

Oh, no.

Uh, this is...
this is Becca.

Becca, this is faiza
and Cedric and Megan.

Megan and I, we were
together for a bit.

Is the abridged version,
just like that?

You two coming in or what?

Nice to meet you.

Good seeing you, Megan.

I don't even want to
hear you guys say it.

Listen, if we knew that
he was going to be here

I would have warned you.

This is a serious pattern,
I am regressing.

Last year I was in college

and I was Chris's fiancÃ©e

and I drank wine in restaurants.

And now I am at home all
day in my underwear,

and I'm nobody's nothing,

and I can't even get into a bar.

What is happening to me?

I am going backwards!

I am Benjamin button-ing!

He moved on,
so what, so can you.

I say take a cab home,

get on that dating
site, pick a cute guy.

No drinks, no dinner,
just a hook-up.

You can't order it,

it's not edible arrangements!

Uh, yeah, you can.

You have tits and the Internet.

Cedric, back me up.

Internet, tits.
Mm-hmm.

Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

Go get them, tiger,
you got this... mwah.

Right?

Â¶Â¶

Ah...

Nope.


Okay.

Fuck it.

He moved on,
so can I.

Hey...

Keeping it lowercase.

Keeping it casual.

Really?!

Okay... come on.

The bar is so low,
it's so very low.

I sound like a computer virus.

Awesome.

Okay.

Do you want to hang out?



Wait!

Oh, shit.

Safety first.


(Computer ringing)

<i>Hey, there.</i>

Oh man, I was... I was just
so sure that I was gonna see

a close-up of
a penis.

<i>Um, yeah, me too.</i>

<i>Wow, you are really pretty.</i>

<i>Really pretty.</i>

<i>Uh, anyway,
so this is me.</i>

<i>Soak it in, um, and this
is my apartment.</i>

<i>As you can see,
it's a magical wonderland.</i>

<i>So do I pass the test or...</i>

Um, yes, I think so.

I've actually... I've never
done this before.

<i>Me neither.</i>
No, no, no, no,
like I know...

I know that people say that,

but I really...
I haven't, nothing.

<i>I know, me either.</i>

Oh, good, um...

Okay, well, I guess then
I will see you soon?

<i>That is awesome.</i>

<i>I mean, that is cool,
sweet, I will...</i>

<i>that will be a very nice
thing to happen, Megan.</i>

<i>I will see you soon.</i>

Okay.

<i>Okay, bye.</i>

I cannot believe
I am schlepping to Brooklyn

for a Booty call.

That is fucking scandalous.

<i>I don't think it shut off right.</i>

No, no, the TV.

(Alarm beeping)


(Alarm blaring)

Is that a...
is that a burglar alarm?

Did you sleep with your coat on?

Yeah, I get cold.

Get the intruder!

(Alarm blaring)

(Alarm beeping)

<i>(Woman)
Alarm reset.</i>

False alarm.

Oh, that's so weird.

It's a bummer that
it woke us up though,

but I should get going.

Um...

I had a great time,
thank you.

It's, um, perfect
for what I needed, so...


Awesome.

Â¶Â¶


Ambitious.

(Alarm blaring)

That's some alarm you got there.

Yeah, I don't even remember
even setting it...

For 11:04.

Weird.

Uh, morning, Megan.

Good morning, Alex.

It's<i> Alec,</i> actually.

Yeah.

What'd I say?
Alex.

Do your way,
one more time.

Alec.

It's got a "c" at the end of it.

Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

It's okay.
Gotcha, sorry.

Well, um...

I had a blast, so...
Thank you for having me.

You're welcome.

My only concern is how
we're gonna sugarcoat this

when we tell our grandkids
how we met.


Right?
Yeah.

We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

So do you wanna grab breakfast

or do you
normally just take off?

Normally?

Huh?

You said, "normally."

Just... like I do this so
much that I'd have a normal

and an abnormal version of it?

That's... yeah, that's
not what I meant.

I have no idea
how often you do this.

I told you last night
that this is my first time

doing anything, you know,
remotely like this.

Yeah, but come on.

Come on.

What?

Megan, do you
expect me to believe

this was your first
one-night stand ever?

Yes!

Yeah, no, I mean, the only
reason that I am here

is because my roommate,

she peer-pressured
the shit out of me.

Yeah, she sexiled you,
or whatever, right?

Exactly, and yet I am sensing

some distinctly judgey vibes

coming from your
side of the bed,

which is odd considering
the team work involved.

There's no judgey vibes coming
from this side of the bed.

Honestly, I really
admire what you did.

I wish more girls were
that forward.

Forward?

There we go
with the slut thing again.

I'm not calling you a slut!

I'm calling you a girl

who went over to a stranger's
house at midnight.

If only there was a word
for someone who does that.

Wow, you know what, screw you.

That was a joke,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

You invited me here,
just remember that.

That's not quite how it happened

but it doesn't matter.

Look, can we please
just eat breakfast?

I make oatmeal with
a little smiley face

made out of jelly, and it's
not slutty at all.

You know what,
save your oatmeal.

I think I'm gonna take off.

But, um,
thanks for having me,

it was awesome to get
to know you.

Have a nice life, Alex.

Okay, cool, well,
I'm just gonna assume

that time was on purpose,

'cause I told you my name
is Alec with a "c"

like a dozen times.
It wasn't on purpose,
but don't worry.

You just have
a stupid name.
Okay, cool, well, bye.

It was lovely having
sex with you!
Aw, I wish
I could say the same.

Hmm, sounded like you had a
pretty good time last night.
You know what?

Don't believe
everything you hear.

Especially when it's something
like, "hey, Alec, cool name."

What is that?

It sounds like
the first draft of a name!

Okay, fuck you, Megan.
Fuck you, back.

(Alarm beeping)

Ah, okay.

What?

Â¶Â¶

(wind whistling)

Ow, shit!

Imagine a sleeping little
angel-faced angel...

No, I'm the angel.

And this angel is being woken up

by a fucking junkyard dog in
a hot-girl body!

Okay, and that's my morning.

Look, I can't...
uh, mom.

I will call you back.

Hi there,
it's Alec, right?

Hmm...

What is it,
a little snow outside?

Yeah, hmm.

Well, new yorkers...

I don't want to say that you
guys are pussies

but seriously,
you should see what

a winter in Minnesota
looks like.

I'll get you a cab.

(Wind whistling)

Holy shit,
that is a lot of snow!

Hmm.
Hmm.

Hmm.

Wow.

<i>Hey, folks, I hope
you aren't planning</i>

<i>on going anywhere anytime soon</i>

<i>'cause let me tell you
something,</i>

<i>it ain't gonna happen, okay?</i>

<i>We are seeing record snowfalls!</i>

<i>This thing came in overnight</i>

<i>and has New York City
in a total whiteout!</i>

<i>We're talking about
tens of thousands</i>

<i>of stranded holiday travelers.</i>

<i>The entire city transit system
is shut down.</i>

<i>The streets have
not even been ploughed.</i>

<i>The mayor's office is urging
people to stay indoors</i>

<i>and to avoid
all nonessential travel.</i>

<i>So get cozy, folks,</i>

<i>because it's going to
be a long weekend.</i>

Faiza, you have to do something,

I cannot stay here.

This is the worst.

<i>(Faiza)</i>
<i>Sweetie, are you even</i>
<i>watching the news?</i>

<i>There's nothing we can do.</i>

Â¶Â¶
see how nice this is?

This could be every day.

But Cedric's an EMT,
can he like...

Helicopter me out
of here or something?

Ha!

<i>(Megan)
Is that Cedric?</i>

Is Cedric laughing at me?
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

Okay, just make the best of it

and we'll rescue you as soon
as we can, okay, I promise.

No, no, no, no,
I would not be here

<i>if you did not slut me out!</i>

Sorry,
I can't hear you.


What?

I think the snow is
messing with the...

with the sat... satellite.

Okay, bye.
Bye.

Faiza!

Grab that ass!


<i>(Rick on TV)</i>
<i>This storm is literally</i>
<i>going to dump</i>

<i>all over the tristate area.</i>

<i>Three to five feet of snow,
maybe more.</i>

<i>In the poconos
and the catskills,</i>

<i>we're talking up to
12 feet of snow.</i>

<i>It's the biggest blizzard
in the history of the world.</i>

This is what I deserve,
it's penance.

Wow, that is officially
the worst review

my oatmeal has ever received.

It's what I get for
slutting it up.

Um, so you really think
God made this blizzard

to punish you for being slutty?

No, I don't think God did it.

That's ridiculous.

I think my grandmother did,
and I just don't know how.

Right, that makes sense.

Well, I would prefer not
to spend the next 24 hours

in an uncomfortable
silence with you,

so why don't we just pretend
that we never had sex?

It didn't happen.

And then we can pretend
that it's just the weather

and not your passive-aggressive
magical grandma.

No, that's like trying to get

the toothpaste back into
the tube... you can't do it.

It is out there.

I have seen your penis.

You've implied I'm a slut.

Those are big things.

Did you just call my penis big?

Uh, no, no, I did not.

I called the implication
of your penis big.

Well, it's still nice to hear.

You can't just...

Erase the fact
that two people had sex.

I think you underestimate us.

Hi, I'm Alec.

I'm Megan.

Megan, it's very
nice to meet you.

Um, what do you do for a living?

Oh, Jesus, that...
that's what we're doing?

Uh, no.

Seriously, already?

We just started.
Mm-hmm.

Hmm, okay.

<i>(Rick on TV)</i>
<i>We are monitoring the situation</i>
<i>very closely.</i>

<i>We're experiencing massive
shutdowns</i>

<i>all over the tristate area.</i>

<i>That includes dutchess county,
Harlan county,</i>

<i>Bronson county,
middlebrook county...</i>

<i>Monmouth county...</i>

Wow, how the time flies.

<i>... poughkeepsie...
Montauk...</i>

<i>Bing... bing...
binghamton,</i>

<i>new paltz.</i>

<i>Uh, new paltz.</i>

<i>What's the capital of New York?</i>

All right, we'll try again,
but there are rules.

No upsetting questions.

I didn't realize it was one.

Well, now you do.

Okay, I am trying very hard
to think of a question

that could in no way be
construed as upsetting.

Do you like dogs?

Perfectly non-upsetting
question, good job... yes.

I like dogs.

Me too.

I have to use the restroom.

That's allowed.

That's allowed.

Â¶Â¶

What?


Damaged?

You don't know me.

(Paper splashing)

(Ball tapping continues)

Do you... possibly
have headphones?

Thank you.

Um, Megan?

What happened?

Uh, what happened,
you happened.

What is that?

Â¶Â¶

God!

Ahh!

Don't worry about it,
I'll take care of it.

No, no, no, no,
you just...

you step away, you are
not cleaning that up.

You will just hold it over
my head, go to your room.

I can handle this.

Gross.

(Water running)

It's cold and gross.

It just keeps coming.

Hey, you gotta turn the knob!

No, I mean the punishments
from the universe.

It's a flood,
it's practically biblical.

Where the fuck is your plunger?

It should be right
next to the, um...

Ah, shit, I let my buddy
borrow my plunger, dammit.

That's why you never let your
friends borrow plungers.

There's like a thousand reasons.

Look, just shut the door.

I'll deal with it later.

Hey, I just thought of an idea
that could fix everything.

Do you wanna get high?

(Wind whistling)

Yeah, me neither,
that was just a test.

Didn't know if you were a cop.

Yep, I'm going to do it,
I'm gonna get high.

You don't care, do you?

Your apartment.

I'm warning you though,

you're about to think
that I'm really cool.

My buddy made it.

I don't know if you can tell,
but he smokes a lot of pot.

I try to encourage his
creativity.

No, I think it fits you.

(Bong bubbling)

Sorry, I'd open a window,
but, you know...

It is a mystery why you
don't have a girlfriend.

Hey, I'm a catch.

I'll bet you 150 bucks
you're gonna die alone.

Well, my future
smoking-hot widow

will gladly accept your money.

(Bong bubbling)

Hey, I'm just saying,
you could afford to

take the edge off a little bit.

It could be good for you.

You should embrace it.

I've gotten high before.

Not with me.

Fine.

It better make you funnier.

Yeah, smoke that shit.

(Bong bubbling)

Â¶Â¶

So earlier you asked
what I did for a living

and I kinda got a little feisty.

You, feisty?

Can't picture it.

Well, the answer is...

I am less-than-employed
at the moment.

I don't do anything.

See, last year
I was able to say,

"I'm a premed student,"

which sounds kind of
impressive, right?

But then I graduated

and I'm not allowed
to say it anymore.

Um...

I think your profile
said premed student.

Yeah, no, I just
haven't changed it yet.

Didn't you make the profile
like two days ago?

That's weird.

What is this, like an
interrogation?

You got something to hide?

No, I just...

I think I'm just
in that limbo phase.

It's not like your degree
has instructions on it.

Well... boom!

Home run, twins
win the world series!

Well, your degree did
say premed,

so you would think
something follows that.

(Ball grinding)

What was that?

Hmm.

Â¶Â¶

So...

Why did you major in premed

if you didn't want to
go into medicine?

I always thought I'd change it,

but then I graduated.

Whoops.

Wait,
how does that happen?

Easier than you would think.

What do you do for a living?

I work at a bank.

Fancy.

Banking.

No, just bank.

I'm an assistant manager.

How does someone like you get
into something that's so...

Wildly exciting?

Yes.
Yes.

I don't know,
I mean, you know, like,

when you're 17 and...

You just want to get out there
and show the world

everything that
you have to offer,

because you have all
this stuff to say?

I don't know
what that feels like.

I don't know.

I never felt like I needed
a job to define my life.

Do you like your job?

Since when are you
supposed to like your job?

I think our generation

catastrophically
misunderstands that.

Interesting.

Â¶Â¶

I forgot the food,
I'm going back for it.

Huh?
No, no, no.

Please, allow me.

Now, I am impressed.
Mm-hmm.

'Cause it's like a Butler
that is also a rug.

For the man who has
everything except a rug.


You know, I used to
smoke back in college.

But one summer, I walked in
on my parents

smoking out of a vaporizer
and watching Italian porn.

Oh my God.
Which is kind of

the greatest antidrugs
psa of all time.

That is awesome!

Kinda gross, but...

It is funny.
Growing up...

All of my friends' parents
were divorced, you know?

But mine, they were
always... so happy.

They were just
so disgustingly happy.

It's a lot to live up to.

I think it kinda messed me up.

My parents are still
married too.
Yeah?

Good for them.
What?

Yeah, when I was a kid

I used to wish that
they'd get divorced

'cause I was jealous of
all my friends

who got to have two Christmas's.

Â¶Â¶

Unh-unh, hm-hm, hm-hm.

What?
You should
turn this off.

You don't like this song?

Oh, no,
I love this song.

It's gonna make me wanna dance.

Yes, you should.

No.
Yes.

Trust me.

Oh, are you like a bad dancer?

Oh, no.

No, no, no.

I am an epic dancer,
but you see...

See, if you see me dance

you'll follow me around
like a little puppy dog

and it'll be
embarrassing for us both.

So you have to stay here.

For your own safety,
trust me on that one.

Â¶Â¶

Okay, um...

So I would just like to

frame the next question in
the context that

my diet doesn't
normally consist of junk food.

And with that in mind

hypothetically...
Yeah?

...if one were to need to
make use of a bathroom

how might one do that

in these special circumstances?

Stop smiling.

Uh...

That's actually
a great question.


(Knocking on door)

Are these your creepy neighbors?

Are you the creepy neighbor?

You're totally
the creepy neighbor.

Hey, Mrs. lopan,
it's Alec.

I just really need
to borrow your plunger.

It's kind of an emergency.

That wouldn't happen to
be their mailbox, would it?

Oh, yeah, you know what,

they're probably away
for the holidays.

You did not just laugh.

It's kind of funny.
Do you see this face?

This is my panic face.

Do we understand?

Yeah.
Okay.

We do.
Good.

Okay, have no fear.

The trusty coat hanger
is here to save the day.

Aw, shucks, I bet you say
that to all the girls.

We're kind of on a clock here.

I mean, there's a plan "b,"

but it might sound
kind of out there.

We are not
getting high again.
Yes, we are.

No, I'm just kidding.

The windows of this building,
they don't really work right.

So we can go out the window,
climb up to the roof

go to the other side

and then get in through
the lopans' fire escape.

Okay.

Maybe just you should do this.

I'm not breaking
and entering alone!

The whole reason we're doing
this is for you.

Why do you have that?

My grandmother left it to me.

Yup, all style complaints
go to her.

I see, mm-hmm, sweet.

Â¶Â¶

(wind whistling)

Let's do this.

Â¶Â¶

You couldn't just
shit in the sink, huh?!

What's wrong?!

It's frozen shut!

It won't budge!

We gotta go back.

There is no turning back!

Whoa!

What the fuck?!
Go, go, go!

Are you kidding me?

Hey, are you fucking insane?

I'm going to have to
pay for that!
I had to!

They will totally understand.

Look, you are a ruiner.

I am not a ruiner!

Sorry, I gotta pee, I had to.

You understand,
you understand.
No, no, no, no, no...

You are an asshole
in so many languages!

You understand.

Oh yeah,
this pee feels so good.


Whoops, sorry,
false alarm.

Oh, yeah?

Oh, God...

Â¶Â¶

Just so you know,

I'm giving you
the silent treatment too.

I just didn't know
if you could tell

and I wanted you to know.

(Water splashing)

Hey, I think we've
solved the mystery

of the clogged toilet.

Wait, what?

No, I told you I would do that!

What is this?
No, it's nothing.

What are you doing?
That's gross.
Give it back.

Megan, this was in a toilet,
that's gross, okay?

If you had a problem
with the reading material

you could have just said
something.

Â¶Â¶

It's just some stupid article.

It wasn't stupid,
though.

It was spot-on.

How pathetic is that,
it's so pathetic...

Do you really think my name

sounds like
the first draft of a name?

Yeah.

Like a good
first draft, you know?

Like it's really close.

And did you really fake it?

What are you talking about?

Last night.

You know, when you were making

what I would describe as like

banshee-esque screams of
pleasure,

and then this morning,

you called into question
their authenticity?

So...

What happened to like,
"hey, let's just pretend

we never had sex?"

Yeah, I'm over that.

Why are you even
thinking about this again?

I haven't stopped
thinking about it.

Oh, all right, well, see,
I just said those things

to hurt your feelings

because you hurt mine, you know?

Yeah, I don't really buy
that because I think women

are most honest actually
when they're trying

to hurt somebody's feelings.

Fine.

But this can't be the first time

that a woman's faked it for you.

Uh, definitely was.

You made your ex come, huh?

Mm-hmm, yep,
pretty much all the time.

Yeah, that often?

And did she come
before or after you?

Usually we...

We would come simultaneously.

At the same time.
Yeah, yeah?

I'm telling you,
it's true.
Bullshit.

That's mean.

No, it's nothing to
be ashamed of either,

it's really hard to do.

For guys it's so easy,
it's just, you know,

it's just friction.

But for girls there's a whole
lot of intangibles down there.

And it's bad that we fake it.

It's not good for you,
it doesn't help us.

It doesn't help the next girl.

Oh, but you're a really
great kisser.

Yeah, you've got
that down pat, it's just...

Practice on my
hand a lot.
...the other stuff.

A lot.
But I had a good time.

Okay.

Well, yeah,
let's talk about this.

So, what, uh...

Yeah, what did I do wrong?

Okay, it's not about
what you did wrong,

it's just how people sync up.

You know, how they fit together.

Mm-hmm, and we
didn't sync up well?

Do you think we did?

Well, you know, it's the first
time, it's awkward.

You don't know what to say,

you don't know
what you're touching.

It's awkward.

It's not like that changes
after the first time.

Well, I mean eventually

they learn what
you like more, but...

You can never talk
about it openly

'cause guys are so sensitive.

Suggesting just the tiniest
thing and it freaks them out

because then they think you've
been thinking that every time,

and then they get mad that you
didn't say something earlier

and you didn't
say something early

because it would have
been too soon.

So the only thing
that there is to do

is train them to recognize
different levels of moans

without them
realizing you're doing it.

In my experience.

Wow.

It works.

Or maybe it's just me.

No, it's like camp,
you know?

You go and you have to do
this activity with a partner

but you can't say anything

so you're just kinda stumbling
your way through it.

Yeah, it's just like camp.

What camp did you go to?
Holy shit.

I just had a great idea.

Do you feel it,
the two of us?

It's a pretty good
opportunity right now.

What... what is?

This... right here.

I'm not...
You don't get it?

Okay, look, listen to me,
so we're trapped.

We're like this incredible
experiment right now,

we're lab rats.

We've had sex, but we
don't have feelings

for each other, right?

And as soon as that
snow clears, you're gone.

Like Mexico-gone.

We don't know any
of the same people,

so we're probably never going
to see each other again.

Yes.

So we can use this time to
be honest with each other,

and we can
give each other advice

and constructive criticism
to make each other

better lovers

for the next
person that comes along.


Okay, firstly, you cannot
pull off the word "lovers."

I think I can.

Secondly, what you are
proposing is potentially...

it's a horrible... it sucks.

It's a bad idea...
don't... what?
Are you kidding me?

This is the best
idea I've ever had!
That's so sad!

Look, Megan, listen,

you can't just like
drop a bomb on me like,

"hey, maybe you've never made

a girl come in your
entire fucking life,"

and then say you don't
want to talk about it.

I wanna talk.

Guys can't handle constructive
criticism about that stuff.

You'll get all pissy...

no.

I promise you that I will not
get pissy if you don't.

What do you mean if I don't?

Oh, did you think
this was just like

a one-way street,
or something?

You think you
have pointers for me?

Well...

Yeah, a thing or two
crossed my mind, but...

I guess you'll never
know, will you?

Jesus, fine,
all right, I bite, go.

Okay, great,
this is good.

Now, this is not just you.

I want to make that clear.

Um, okay, the lights-off
thing.

What the fuck is that?

If the lights are off,
like you requested

and I so gentlemanly obliged,

I could be having sex with
anything, literally.

But I don't want to be
having sex with anything.

I wanna be having sex with you.

Not you specifically,
but like the universal you.

Lights on?

Wow.

All guys feel that way?

I can only speak for me
and my friends, but yeah.

Duh, girls hear that
more than hello.

That's what you got?

All I'm saying
is that we're young

and we're hot-looking people,

and we should embrace
that shit while we have it.

All right, fine!

Guys like to do it
with the lights on.

Noted, awesome,
shocked.

What else you got?
Do you want more?

Do you have more?
Yeah, I do.

Okay, um...

What else do you
do that I don't like?

Okay, yeah, you do this thing

where you stand up from the bed

and you kind of
turn halfway around

and then you get undressed
as fast as you can all at once

and it's like you're
getting ready

for a physical or something.

I have never had any complaints
about how rapidly I undress.

Most guys like naked me.
I love naked you.

Naked you is awesome
to look at and touch.

What I mean is that
you could make

the getting-naked-there
part a little like...

What's up?
Boop.

Then you take
your bra off the side.

You could even imaginary pole,

just bring it, smack it.

Bring it down...
oh God!

Bring it up.

Do the little ass thing
with your underwear.

"Hey, I dropped
something, my panties."

You can flick it up.

You could catch it.

Then I don't care
what you do with it.

Actually
that wasn't terrible.

You should put on heels
and try it.

Yeah, you're right,
this is weird.

No, no, no,
man-up, finish.

Just get ready for an onslaught.

Okay, that definitely didn't
sound like it was in the vein

of constructive criticism but
I will continue, nonetheless.

Look, all...

I'm saying is that
guys like undressing.

And you could make it
more of a... thing.

Okay.
Okay.

Lastly, when I was
inside of you,

you started doing this thing...

you started helping yourself
a little bit

and it kind of made me feel
like I was being benched.

Second string.
Noted.

Okay.
Duly noted.

Is it my turn?
Yeah.

Don't ever do that.

Okay.

That's the international thing.

Okay, I don't know
who first taught guys

to do the "alphabet with
their tongue" thing,

but it kind of makes me
feel like I'm Helen Keller

being fucked by her teacher.

And that is not
a fantasy of yours?

There was a moment,
one moment during foreplay

in which I was maybe
close to coming.

And I believe I subtly
pointed this out for you.

Do you remember what it
was that I said?

"I'm close to coming."
Yes, uh-huh.

And then after I said that,

you switched up
what you were doing.

Just what was your thought
process there?

Um, I mean, honestly,

I thought I was doing
like a finishing move.

Kind of like
a "mortal kombat" thing like,

"finish her!"

And like really hit it, but...

I thought I was
doing something like that.

It's not...

Next time,
just, you know,

keep on doing what it was
that you were doing

because you got her to third

and you can get her home.

Okay.

You waited for me to undress
you, which is unnecessary

and also a little weird

because I'm not your mom
tucking you into bed.

You kept trying
to give me hickeys,

which nobody likes.

Oh, and you went
like way too fast,

like you were drilling
me for oil.

You know, like my whole body
was like, "zzhh-zzhh-zzhh..."

And then... oh, oh, you did
find my g-spot,

but kind of like
a drive-by, which was cool,

but then you kept going.

And I so wanted you to stop.

Oh, okay, all right.

When a girl is helping herself,

that's a good fucking thing.

My ex was weird about
that too, and it's...

it's not like
we're competing on some

awesome erotic Japanese
game show;

we are having sex.

You know, like,
embrace the team spirit.

Oh, and last night,
when we were done,

you retreated to
the other side of the bed

like you planted a bomb
down there.

So next time,
just hold the girl,

count to like ten.

It'd go a long way, that one.

You can thank me later.

Other than those things,

you were a perfectly
adequate lover.

Adequate,
wow, thank you.

Adequate's not really...

See, I knew
this would happen.
...a compliment.

I told you this
was a bad idea.
That's cool.

It's a fine idea,
I'm good.

I'm like teflon,
baby, nothing sticks to me.

We should totally check out
the news though

for some updates.

<i>As you can see,
this storm is showing</i>

<i>no signs of slowing down!</i>

<i>I want you to look at something.</i>

<i>Behind me is
the empire state building,</i>

<i>but you can't see it.</i>

<i>All you can
see is snow.</i>

I bet you a 150 bucks

Rick Raines is
fully erect right now.


<i>It's like an incredible
disappearing act...</i>

That's funny.

<i>Okay, I'm hearing that
that's actually not where</i>

<i>the empire state building is,
but it does show you the...</i>

Is it cool
if I take a shower?

No.

Yes, it's fine.

The towels are...
On the floor.

<i>Reporting from the streets of
New York City, I'm Rick Raines.</i>

(Water running)

<i>I just got off the phone
with the governor's office</i>

<i>and they told me this storm
is a real motherfucker...</i>

That was quick.

<i>I can't say that, okay.</i>

What if we tried again?

I can't take any more critiques.

No, no, I mean,
what if we...

Tried again.

Tested our theories for science.

Â¶Â¶

For...

...science.

Yeah, I think it would be
really helpful for me.

Because I'm more
of a hands-on learner.

Yeah, we could...
we could do that.

Good.

Okay.

And the channel of
communication stays open.

Mm-hmm.

We say whatever's on
our mind, that's the deal.

Okay, we should
film it.
Hmm.

No?
Too far?

Sorry.

How should we start?

Okay, so normally,
on date situations,

there would be more of
a build-up here, right,

but since this is strictly
a hookup scenario

I think it'd be
fine if you just...

it's not bad.

Whoa.

Uh, shit.
Okay, see, the lack of sheets

kind of makes it look
a little crack den-y.

Which is great for like a
role-playing scenario but...

yeah, it was
laundry day.
Mm-hmm.

Okay, get over here.

Okay.

They should label it
or something, right?

I think it's inside out
actually, but it's fine.

That's good,
yeah, where were we?
Good, right here.

Oh.

Ah, a fan of the bed push.

That's a classic.

Oh, no, no, no,
shoes and socks first.

There's never a good time
for it so, you know...

Get them off.

Oh, God.

Good compromise.

I like that.
Thank you.

I'm like the un of doing it.

Is that sort of
what you had in mind?

Yeah, that's good.

That's pretty good, you got
the hang of that, mm-hmm.

Good.

Â¶Â¶

I have sensitive nipples.

That one is really sensitive.

Any notes?
No.

(Blowing raspberry)

No!

If there is one thing
that you take away

from this whole
experience... never.

Sorry, I was trying to
cool you off.

My dad used to give me those.

And now I am just
thinking about my dad.

Ew, that's gross,
I'm sorry.

That's better.

That is... much better.

Japanese alphabet.

Thank you,
rosetta stone.

Holy shit!
That was awesome!

Hey.

Up and at 'em.

Wake up.

Hey.

We fell asleep.

Yeah, is that a problem?

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

I don't see what the
educational purposes of it are.

Plus, I'm hungry.

Um...
We're gonna starve.

Not if you like mustard.

Why don't you have food?

Well, I had food,

and then we ate it all
when we were really high.

Oh, yeah.

Three-year-old banana?

Oh, here we go.

Â¶Â¶

This might have to last days.

We'll ration it.
Okay.

This is good.

All right, we just
need to get creative.

Give me like... give me
ten minutes,

I'll figure
something out.
Okay, but don't hog.

All right, you wanna
go back to bed?

Let me figure it out.

Special delivery.

Where did you
get these?
Hmm?

Don't worry about it.

These are your
neighbors' noodles!

These are contraband noodles.

You threw such
a hissy fit about the window

and now look at you...
you are a common thief.

I know.

And, for the record,

I actually thought it
was pretty badass

when you broke
that window like that.

Thank you, I did too.

You might not
be the worst person

in the world to be stuck with.

Right back at you.

So were your parents doctors?

Mm-mm.

Oh, I thought maybe they were

and that's why you rebelled

and didn't
want to do it anymore.

So what happened?
It doesn't matter.

Yeah, it does,
come on, you can tell me.

It wouldn't even
make sense to you.

Everything makes sense to me.

It's the burden of
being a genius.

I can't help it.


It's not, um...

It's not that I stopped
wanting to be a doctor.

So you do want to be a doctor.

No, I meant
I didn't change my mind.

I<i> never</i> wanted to be
a doctor, ever... ugh.

Then why would you
go into premed?

Okay, um...

So...

I was engaged once.

Once.

Sounds like
I'm writing a memoir.

Um, I was engaged recently.

We dated through high school,

followed him to nyu.

When I had to
pick a major, I, uh...

I never actually planned
on needing it.

I just wanted to
be a wife and a mom.

See, people always
look at you funny

when you say something that

'cause they feel bad
for you, or they...

Megan, I'm not...
I'm sorry, I wasn't

trying to look
at you funny.
No, it's fine.

You're missing out
on something, but...

Oh.

I don't know, I mean...

It worked for my parents

and I always thought that
I'd do the same.

And then the universe
called my bluff.

What happened?

He cheated.
Oh.

Yeah, and sadly that
wasn't even the deal-breaker.

I wanted to work through
it, but he...

Wanted out.

He said that he wanted to
find a girl with

more of her own life.

Dropped the word "ambition"
a few times.

Ooh, yeah, I've had that word
thrown at me a few times too.

Believe it or not.

I believe it.

Ambition is such bullshit.

Seriously, it's just chasing
vapor, like...

Whatever it is that
you think that you need

like that job or that gold star,

blue ribbon,
fancy desk, nice office,

like it doesn't...

like once you get that,
you're gonna be confused

because you're not gonna
be as happy

as you thought
you were going to be.

Then you're going to be
sitting there being like,

"why aren't I happy?

I have this...
I got the desk."

Because, man, there's
another desk.

Like there's always
going to be something more

that your ambition is telling
you that you need

so it's the next thing,

and then when you get that,
there's another thing.

It's an endless cycle.

You're forced into retirement.

You're kicking and screaming.

The next thing you know,
you're in a big house,

you've got four-and-a-half
bathrooms,

you don't even
have a ping-pong table

and you're dead.

Let's fucking go blow shit up!

Like you're dead.

I just blacked out for a second.

Thank you for
staying with me on that,

I didn't know if I was going to
come out the other side.

Blowing up stuff always helps.

So what happened with that guy?

Nothing.

A semester later
I graduated with a degree

I had no intention of using.

And here I am.

So you've really never had
a one-night stand before?

I have told you this
like 100 times.

Well, you should know, they
usually don't last this long.

Well, that's a bummer.

Wow.

That guy is so screwed.

What do you mean?

You said that he met you
in high school, right?

Mm-hmm.

So, he thinks that you're
a certain type of girl,

and he thinks that he will meet

that same type of girl later
in his life when he's ready.

But... when he's ready,

that girl's
not going to be there.

He has no idea how rare you are.

What are those?
What?

Those?

You're giving me
googly-eyes.

You totally are,
you're giving me googly-eyes!

I'm just really
thirsty right now,

so those are my thirsty eyes.

You look thirsty too.

I'm going to get us some drinks.

Can I pull a classic girl move

and confiscate your biggest,
comfiest sweatshirt?

And I promise,
I will not steal it.

Yeah, one sec.

Â¶Â¶

Please be a cross-dresser.

I found some
peach schnapps.

The bottle was a little
dusty but I think

the liquor
is still... good.

So where's Daisy?

San Francisco.

You're with her?

That's a tough
question to answer.

No, it's not.

See?
You just did.

Megan, here.

Look, let's talk about this.

You have the place to
yourself, and, boy...

Do you make the most of it.

When does she get back?

She was supposed to
get back this afternoon

but her flight got canceled.

I heard about that.

Apparently there's this
huge fucking blizzard.

You know, I always wondered
what it would be like

to be the other girl.

It feels better.

Not great,
but undeniably better.

Hold on.

Thank God, it stopped.

Â¶Â¶

<i>(Rick on TV)</i>
<i>Let's take a look at some of</i>
<i>the outside stuff.</i>

<i>We're looking at
the New Jersey transit</i>

<i>making local stops
all day long.</i>

<i>Here in menlo park...</i>

Can I show you something?

Please
just leave me alone.

I'm not mad.

How can I be?

I didn't ask and you didn't lie.

I wanted meaningless sex
and I got it.

Let me show you this.

Please.

Read.

So she dumped you but
you still live with her?

She didn't give it to me yet.

I don't understand.

And honestly,
I don't care.

Three weeks ago she asked
me to look for her wallet

and when I was
looking for her wallet

I accidently found this.

I didn't know what to do.

So I gave her her wallet
back at lunch

and then the next
day she left for tour.

Tour?
What is she, like...

she's a dj.

Of course.

Of course, she's like the
coolest girl imaginable.

I made that profile because

I wanted to have something
to throw in her face

whenever she
wanted to pull the trigger.

And I know that's very immature.

You could have
broken up with her.

Yeah.

Yeah, I thought about that.

People talk about how
great it is to be single

and that's bullshit,

joining the single party.

It's not a party, it's a bunch
of people

sitting around
in the dark, texting.

<i>Your complaints about how slow
the plowing</i>

<i>is going in outer boroughs
such as queens and Brooklyn</i>

<i>are not falling on deaf ears.</i>

<i>And we're hearing from
the sanitation department</i>

<i>that they're getting that done
right away.</i>

And I did something
stupid, and I'm sorry.

<i>... report that
the subways and buses</i>

<i>are starting to run,
as well.</i>

Excuse me.

<i>Most of the storm is pushed up
into the shenandoah valley...</i>


(Truck beeping)

Megan, wait.

Hey...

Come on, I didn't...
what was I supposed to do?

I didn't even know that
you existed, I don't...

look, I don't
want her, I want you.

I want you.

And what makes you
think that I want you?

You're just some funny guy
that works at a bank.

I think you
severely overestimate

your ability to break hearts.

Come on.

Â¶Â¶

Oh my God, Megan!

Hey.

Hey.

Is that my duvet?

Hi.

Oh, God.

You guys
are monsters.
God!

How was your date?

Â¶Â¶

You looked so tired
I wanted to let you sleep.

Hey, what are you...
Doing?

Daisy,
we should talk.
Yeah, I know.

I found the note in the trash.

I have the note right here.

When did you find this?

Um, when I was
looking for your wallet.

By accident.

I see what's going on here.

You read this, and then you
wanted me to come home

and find this slutty
little lipstick haiku

so that you could be the one
that ended us.

It's not a haiku,
there's not enough syllables.

You are a child.

Yeah.

Look, Daisy, we both know

that we weren't
right for each other.

And I think we both knew that
for a long time,

but it's fine.

We were just scared
that the perfect person

wasn't out there for us.

And what if they're not?

I think they are.

Okay, so what now?

I can move my stuff
over to Kevin's place.

He owes me for a plunger.

Okay.

Let me know when you're out.

Hey, Daisy...

Can I ask you something?

Yeah.

Did you ever...

Fake it?

Wow.

A year together.

Done.

And that's what you're
thinking about right now?

No, I'm thinking of all
kinds of stuff right now.

I'm thinking of memories
and feelings and...

But I just need to
know if... did you do that?

Yeah, I'm sorry.

I got lazy.

But you shouldn't have faked it.

Okay, because
that's not helping anybody.

You gotta communicate.

What happened to you?

(Door closing)

Tell her, talk to her.

Megan, faiza has something
she wants to tell you.

Okay.

Listen, normally
I'd wait to bring this up

until after you'd
recovered a bit,

but Cedric and I sort of enjoyed

having the place to ourselves
the past couple nights.
We did.

And I wasn't sure that we would,

'cause I am so used to you
always being here, you know?

Like... nonstop,
all the time.

Um, but...
baby, help me out, please.

Yeah, basically we were
just thinking,

what if you moved out,

you know, like what
would that be like?

And you have to understand,

you can stay here as
long as you need,

until you get on your feet.

A couple of days,
three days...

However long you want.

Four days.
Okay.

No, I think...

I think it's a really good idea.

You do?
She says she does.

Look, I only moved to New York
because of Chris.

And I thought
that if I went home

it would just be admitting that.

So I stayed

and made sure that
the Internet wasn't lonely.

I needed a kick in the ass.

Cool, so do you know
what you're gonna do?

No.

No, I have no fucking clue.

No idea, unh-unh.

Do you know what this means?

That this is our last
new year's Eve

as roommates.

Awesome.

Yeah, hey, so I realize this
is probably word-for-word

something that
a crazy person would say,

but I met a girl on your
website a few nights ago and...

<i>(woman)</i>
<i>I think I can save us</i>
<i>both some time here.</i>

Yeah, no, no, no, I don't
need her address or anything,

I just need to know
her last name.

<i>I'm sure it was magical,</i>

<i>but we cant give our
customers'</i>

<i>personal information to
anyone other than the police.</i>

<i>So, provided you're
not a cop,</i>

<i>is there anything else
I can help you with today?</i>

Nope.

Â¶Â¶

It's not just
a show for kids.

Anybody can get into it.

You know, it's for anybody
who cherishes

friendship, adventure.

There's this one character,
her name is applejack,

she's my favorite.

She's such a fireplug.

She kind of reminds me
of you, actually.

I think I lost you there.

Excuse me?
Hello?

I'm just going to
put this out here,

but you're kind of a fucking
terrible conversationalist.

I don't
know if... if ever...

I think it's
because you are so...

...captivating.

I am just intimidated
as fuck... whoo.

Oh, no, there's
nothing to be scared of.

Excuse me.
No, no, no,
please, please.

Godammit!

Okay, yeah,
all right, great.

Son of a motherfucking bitch!

Motherfucking
son of a fucking bitch!

Fuck!

<i>(Rick on TV)</i>
<i>And now is the moment you've</i>
<i>all been waiting for...</i>

(Party horn blowing)

<i>Whoo!</i>

(Party horn blowing)

Megan.

Long time no see.

It's Ben.

From bio class?

How are you here?

Do you know faiza?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm good buddies with Cedric.

We're going to get more booze.

Have fun you two!

You!

You are the dumb,
pretty guy!

Oh...

Uh, thank you?

Mh-hmm.

I was supposed to bang you.

This is the universe
correcting itself... oops.

So where'd you decide
on med school?

Just a surprise, I got
into both my top choices

but now I'm simply just
trying to decide.

It's a big decision and...

and obviously
my dad has opinions...

Megan, Megan?

You know, it's just...
Shh, shh...

Police!
Megan?

Megan, right?

Any noise complaints
go to faiza or to Cedric,

because this is their
apartment now.

Actually they're
asking for you specifically.

What's up, dog?

Megan pagano?

You wanna step in
the hall with us?

Why?

Officers found this in
the lopans' bathroom.

You don't understand.

This guy is a psychopath.

He's setting me up!

He is setting
this whole thing up!

Which I realize

is exactly what
a crazy person would say

but that explains my situation.

He is so crazy that he is
forcing me to sound crazy.

Do you see what he's doing?
Ma'am...

Did you, or did you not,

break in through the window of

Mr. and Mrs. lopan's
apartment?

You, um...
You got a little...

Some...

Okay, got it.

Pretty.

(Lock buzzing)

Which one of you is
Megan pagano?

You made bail.

Wait, that's...
that's impossible.

I haven't even made
a phone call yet.

She can do that?

She can refuse my bail?

Are you serious?

Okay, look, I just...
I need to talk to her.

You can only visit during
visiting hours,

and if, and only if,
the person wants to see you.

Which I'm gonna guess she
doesn't, being that she would

rather remain locked in jail
than see your face.

Wow... rude.

Uh, okay, well,
what if I told you that

I helped her break into
that apartment?

Then would you
lock me up with her?

Yeah, that's how
police stations work.

Are you being
sarcastic?
Are you serious?

I need to talk to her!

Oh, okay then.

Five, four, three, two, one!

Happy new year!

Â¶Â¶

(dog barking)

(Lock buzzing)

How about these two?

Are they special enough
to post your bail?

Oh my God,
what happened?

Just take me home.

Here.

Hey.

Who is that?
I'm sorry.

But I didn't
know your last name.

What was I supposed to do?

Literally anything but this!

Okay, you're upset,
but, Megan,

you felt something
and I felt something.

What I felt was
Stockholm syndrome.

Hey, hey, I can't let you
walk out another door

without listening to me.

Why are you doing this?

You have a girlfriend.

That's over now.

Look, Megan,
hey, let me explain.

I should have told you
about her, and there were

times last night I wanted to
tell you about her

and I should have,

but there was
other times last night

that I forgot that other
people even existed.

And I know that sounds
stupid, 'cause your friends

are staring at me like my
fucking dick is hanging out.


I'm sorry,
it was funny.

Sir?

Okay,
let's wrap this up.

The cop's not happy,
let's keep the cop happy.

Megan?

You put me in jail!
I'm sorry.

For like criminals!

He's got about five seconds
before he finds out firsthand.

Okay, fine, fuck, shit.

Uh, look, not directed at you,
and not directed at you.


Look, I messed up.

I messed up, but I am
really, really sorry.

But you can't stop us
before we even realize

what we could be.

And we should figure
that out, maybe...

Maybe we hang out

and we realize
we don't like each other.

Maybe you're very intimidated
by my dancing,

or maybe I find out
you're like...

Really racist.

Okay, that
was a hypothetical.

Look, all I'm saying is that
there's a lot of stuff

that I don't know about you

and there's a lot
that we need to talk about.

I spent two nights with you,

and that's not enough time.

Give me more time,
please.

It was a little shaky
in the middle

but he finished strong.

I'm touched.

Megan,
what do we think?

I think you put me in jail.

We're still on that?

Look,
hey, hey, come on.

Some day you're gonna
laugh about this.

I promise that
you're gonna find this

all very funny some day.

Okay, let's make a deal.

You give me your number,
and leave.

And the minute I laugh about it,

I'll let you know.

Stay as long as you want.

That guy was nuts.

Can I hang out
with him?
Cedric!

I'm just saying, I don't
meet a lot of funny people.

Okay, funny people don't
drive ambulances.


Â¶Â¶

Shit.

Â¶Â¶

<i>(Alec)
Hello?</i>

You are kind of an idiot,

do you realize
that about yourself?

You good?

<i>Yeah, I've heard that.</i>

You know that was all me, right?

No, it was not.
What the fuck are you
talking about?

It was.

...do you think in the spirit
of constructive criticism,

the next time you
wanna win a girl back

after doing something stupid,

like practice your speech,
or something

for the next girl, because...

I'm gonna be honest...
yours just fucking sucked!

Shit, it was... I was
embarrassed for you...

mm-mm.
Mm, mm, what?

It's way too soon.

Way too soon.
That's fair.

That's totally fair.

Â¶Â¶

Okay, I'm sorry that
I put you in jail,

but have you thought
about what that's

going to do for
your street cred?

Yeah, of course, I have,

that was like the first
thing I thought of.

Gonna get that shit tattooed.

And you don't
have to worry about

the lopans pressing charges
'cause I took care of 'em.

Did you
murder the lopans?
It had to be done.

You did it without me?
Mm-hmm.

Ahh...

I think I'm ready
for that kiss now.

Yeah?
Yeah.

You taste like prison.

Is it really
snowing again?
Oh, yeah.

Look at 'em, a million tiny,
little matchmakers.

Thank you, snowflakes.

So...
Your place or mine?

I don't have a place anymore.

Me neither.

You are a catch.

So are you.
