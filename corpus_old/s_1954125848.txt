Welcome to Mexia, Texas, my hometown.

Most people pronounce it
"Mex-ia," and it's not.

It's "Me-hay-ya."

This here is the chicken stand where I used to work.

And it's where I met my first husband.

Oh, shoot.
I don't wanna talk about him.

Cut. Cut. Ha-ha.

WOMAN 1: Anna, come here.
MAN 1: Anna!

MAN 2: Yeah!
MAN 3: Anna!

<i>â™ª You want a little fun? â™ª</i>

MAN 4: Here!
WOMAN 2: Anna!

<i>â™ª Here I come</i>
<i>Oh, you want to go wild â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You want to set this off â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hold onto your glass</i>
<i>'Cause your world will rock â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We might get crazy</i>
<i>Hey, baby, don't fear â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Get ready to party</i>
<i>The party's here â™ªâ™ª</i>

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ANNA:
<i>I'll be buried as international celebrity</i>

<i>and balls-to-the-wall</i>
<i>party girl,</i>

<i>Anna Nicole Smith,</i>

<i>but I was born Vicky Lynn Hogan.</i>

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Vicky Lynn.

Your hair looks like something nested in it.

Did you brush it?

I forgot.

Don't forget tomorrow, okay?
I'll see you later.

ANNA:
<i>My mama married four different men.</i>

<i>None of them, as far as I could tell,</i>

<i>were worth two ugly craps.</i>


<i>I don't know why Mama's younger sister lived with us.</i>

AUNT:
Thanks for the ride.

See you tomorrow.

<i>But I know it would have been a whole lot worse for me</i>

<i>if she hadn't.</i>

[DOOR CLOSES]

STEPDAD:
Clean your room today?

Let me see.

I told you not to lock your door.

AUNT:
Go away.

STEPDAD:
Unlock your door.


AUNT:
Go away.

Get away from me.

Stop it.


AUNT:
Hands off.

Get off me.

Stop.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

<i>I always felt like if I hadn't met Marilyn</i>

<i>I never would've become Anna.</i>

MOTHER: You better run.
STEPDAD: Yeah.

You get out of here and never come back, do you hear me?

You scumbag.


WOMAN:
Vicky Lynn.

Vicky Lynn.

Vicky Lynn.

Who are you?

I'm Anna.

Anna Nicole.

You're so pretty.

When you grow up, you're gonna
get earrings just like mine.

Vicky Lynn.

Are you really sure you need all that?

Everybody's wearing makeup now.

I suppose so.

You going bowling, little girl?
Is that what you told me? Mm.

Sounds exciting.

Guess there's gonna be boys
at the alley. There always are.

And with you dressed like that,

gonna get yourself some attention.

Even if your makeup's a mess.

Oh, I'm just playing.

You want some hot chocolate?

Sure.

[LOCK CLICKS]

Mama.
Believe me,

I have no interest in locking my daughter in her room.

But when you start dressing like that,

that's what a good mama needs to do.

It takes no genius to figure out it's leading you

to balling some boy in back of a Buick,

which will lead to an unwanted baby,

which I have interest none in taking care of.

I just wanna go bowling.
Pretty please.

Don't ruin this for me.
I'm not ruining nothing.

It's men that ruined my life.

And I don't wanna see you making the same mistakes I did.

I didn't have anyone to help me make right decisions.

Mama, why don't you trust me?

I shouldn't have gotten married at 16.

Please, Mama.

Had a baby right off.

Let me out of here.
Nobody should.

And I'm doing this for your own good.

Mom.
Honestly, I am.

I ain't gonna have a baby, Mama.

I just wanna go bowling.

Mama, let me out of here.

Mama, please.

I just wanna go bowling.
Please. Mama.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[BABY CRYING]

Well, go ahead, leave.
I won't know you're gone.

Whatever crap hole you end in,
they won't know you got there.

That ain't even nice.

It's okay, pumpkin.

[BABY CRYING]

[ENGINE STARTS]

I told you not to marry the cook
at Crispy Carl's Fried Chicken.

And I told you and I told you

and I don't know how many times

I told you not to have a baby so young.

Danny is the best thing that's ever happened to me.

Fry cook throw you out?

No, he didn't throw me out.
I left.

Well, aren't you the cat's meow?

I'm not gonna take care of what you can't.

Mama, you ain't gonna have to.

I can take care of Danny just fine.

We ain't got nowhere to go.

Please?

The best lessons, Vicky Lynn, are the hardest.

My advice is to get back in that car

and figure out how to take care of yourself

because that's all you got in this world anyway.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Don't worry, pumpkin.

[DANNY CRYING]

I'll figure something out.

ANNA:
<i>They say mothers have a natural instinct</i>

<i>to protect their offspring.</i>

<i>Well, they never had my mama.</i>

[MUFFLED DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]

MAN:
Well, it's your lucky day.

Eighteen dollars!

Over here. Come on.

What you doing?

Come on. Right here.

Well, the truth of it is, sugar,

we're all full up on waitresses right now.

But, now, if you're not too shy, what about performing?

Give you a look-see
on the pole-dancing side.

<i>â™ª You make me say</i>
<i>La la la la â™ª</i>

How's the pay
on the pole-dancing?

Even without much on top, 10 times as much.

Heck, sky's the limit.

<i>â™ª La la la la</i>
<i>From dust till dawn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª World go round, and baby</i>
<i>That ain't nothing new â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And so we shake up the day</i>
<i>And we kick into play â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Until the night</i>
<i>Turns into day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Push up the beat</i>
<i>Keep it movin' â™ª</i>

[BEADS RATTLING]

<i>â™ª And we let our hair loose â™ª</i>

Pitiful.

Try this.


Girl.

Having trouble stepping up?

Yeah.
This might help.

The pill's Xanax. It'll help
you forget about yourself.

And the champagne?

Well, that just tastes good.


I got you.

ANNA:
Vicky Lynn.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

BAR OWNER:
Hey, we don't have all day out here.

<i>â™ª There's only one thing</i>
<i>Left to do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Push up the beat</i>
<i>Keep it movin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Shake up the day</i>
<i>And we kick into play â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Until the night</i>
<i>Turns into day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Push up the beat</i>
<i>Keep it movin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm nervous and it shows</i>
<i>I wanna make you proud â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've got a crush on you</i>
<i>You know it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm nervous and it shows</i>

<i>â™ª I've got a crush on you â™ª</i>

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Whoa. Don't hurt
yourself, Mama.

Well, don't climb any higher.

You buy this for us?

Well, I'm just renting it for now.

But it's got three bedrooms,

so you get your own and I get my own,

and we can turn the third bedroom

into our own private playroom.

You're the best mama, Mama.
Ha-ha-ha.

And I hope you remembered to pack your bathing suit.

What for?

Well, that would be owing to
what we got in our new backyard.

We don't have swimming pool in our backyard.

Yeah, we do.
What?

Let's go. Whoa!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Girl, I'm so sick of these cheap men.

My God.

DANCER 1:
I gots to get paid.

DANCER 2:
Got to get that money.

Oh, you know, rumor has it,

<i>Playboy's</i> scouring for local talent.

DANCER 3: Uh-uh.
DANCER 1: Mm-hm.

You know how much you make in a centerfold?

DANCER 1: Hell, who cares about the money?
I'd do it for the exposure.

ANNA:
<i>My customers were happy, club owner was slap happy.</i>

<i>Only being who wasn't tickled pink was Anna Nicole</i>

<i>who had bigger plans.</i>

ANNA:
Vicky Lynn.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh. Oh,
that's something.

Give me something.
Get down there.

I just got static cling.
Mm-hm.

We're gonna impress the heck out of<i> Playboy.</i>

All right.
Oh, I like that.

You know, my time's free, but, you know,

there's the cost of film stock, development, printing.

It ain't cheap.

How are you gonna pay for this?

We'll figure something out.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hey.

BEN:
Come on.

I wanted to go to the country club.

I got you.

Can't spring wood anymore.

What do I need to go to a strip club for?

The ambience.



Come on. You'll love it.

It'll be like old times.

So this is really all yours?

Yep.

And a house in Houston,

a couple of others here and there.

Yeah.

You like this stallion?
Oh, he's beautiful.

Yeah, well, that's good, because he's yours.

He is?

Provided you fulfill the obligations

of the Anglo-Saxon bequeathment
ceremony, he is.

The what?
Bequeathment.

It's pretty intricate, actually.

You have to, uh...

You have to say "thank you."
That's it?

That's the whole ceremony?

Yeah.

All right, I guess.

Thank you, Paw Paw. Ha-ha.
Ha-ha.

Look what you've done.

You've not only fulfilled the obligations.

You have excelled at them so much, I'm beholden

to bequeath upon you my entire ranch.

The whole ranch?

Not a question of whether I want to or not.

By virtue of your thank-you,
I'm required to.

Well, sounds like you're gonna
be expecting a lot in return.

I expect you to come here often enough

so that the horses know you.

And I expect you to wake up early enough

to watch the sun come up over those hills.

And if you want to do more than that, just be intimate.

And that's the whole trifecta.

I mean, let me tell you something.

Just being around you is good enough.

You make me feel like I'm 75 again.

You wanna ride that stallion?

Well, yeah.

Well, good.

Bill, saddle up Big Boy.

Lady Love here might take him for a spin.

Okay.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

VICKY LYNN:
There's another man in my life.

Nobody said anything about monogamy.

That wasn't what I meant.

My son.

He's always gonna come first.
Well, that's fine.

I like Danny.

And if you and I ever find our way to an altar,

I'll take care of him too.

Well, I don't wanna be taken care of.

I want people the world over to know who I am.

To whisper to their friend when
I walk in that, "That's her."

I wanna grace the pages of magazines,

printed in 60 different languages.

Star in my own TV show.

Stand 50 feet tall on that silver screen.

I got big dreams,
J. Howard Marshall.

Well, I don't think

your having a sugar daddy with lots of money

who's fine with all your big dreams

is gonna hurt your chances one bit.


VICKY LYNN:
Ha-ha-ha. They were so close.

Did you see that?

Yeah.

Hello?

This is E. Pierce.

I think we have a problem with your father.

Partially of my own making.
<i>A female problem?</i>

Very big female problem.

I'm afraid your father thinks that he's in love.

Okay. Thank you, Ben.

I'll handle it from here.

[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

[PEOPLE CHATTERING]

Ooh. Heh.

Mom, what's he doing here?

Shut up and smile.

Well, look at you.

Well, how do you like motor scooters?

They're pretty cool.
Get out of that suit.

Check what's in the garage.

Sweet!
Hey, say "thank you."

DANNY:
Thanks, Paw Paw.


Why do I feel like

I'm looking at jackals ready to tear me a new one?

Because you are.

Relax, Lady Love.

You're a lioness.

Yeah.

J. HOWARD: Everett.
Excuse me.

Hey, Dad.
J. HOWARD: Vicky Lynn,

E. Pierce.

Fine son, but prone to making it
harder than hell on every woman

I've ever courted after his mother.

E. Pierce,
meet Vicky Lynn,

the woman who's given me reason to keep breathing.

Charmed, Miss Vicky.

Likewise, E. Pierce.

Well, it's been a long day,
and I'm feeling a little tired.

So, if you don't mind, I'll excuse myself.

Not at all, Dad.

J. HOWARD: Ben.
BEN: Yes, sir.

See you around.
All right.

J. PIERCE: Good night, Dad.
J. HOWARD: Good night.

So, uh, J. Howard,

E. Pierce.

You Marshalls are big on initials, huh?

Ha-ha-ha.

I guess.
Call me V. Lynn,

if it makes you feel more comfortable.


Well, Dad didn't tell me what it is exactly that you do.

I'm a model.
Oh.

And an actress.
Ah.

A model-actress.

Oh. How exciting.

So can I get you a drink?

No, no, no. I don't drink,
and I won't be staying.

Model-actress, huh?
Yeah.

That's funny.
I heard you were nothing

but a pole dancer from Harris County.

And just an FYI,
V. Lynn,

it isn't your liquor, and this ranch is not your ranch.

My dad's money is not your
money, and it's never gonna be.

I know you got him by the balls

but you can save a whole lot of time twirling

those phony boobs in his face

and get your ass out of his life forever.

That had a nice rhythm to it.

Sounds like you've been practicing.

Here's an FYI
right back at you, E. Prick.

Your daddy's already asked me to marry him.

Is that so?
More than once too.

But I told him no.

And as far as phony goes,

these may be build-ons

but my feelings for your father are as real as rain.

Dick wad.


How's your big coming-out going?

I feel like poop.

Hey, hey, hey. I got something
that'll brighten up your night.

I got some Xani, a-many.

I got some of that white stuff too.

Blow this off.

Let's go see Howard's fancy marble bathroom,

I'll set you up.

And then I'll tell you why I'm holding.

Wanna know why I'm holding?

Because you're a stoner?

No, Miss Smarty-Pants.

Because I just got a call from<i> Playboy.</i>

That's right.
Are you serious?

Let's go party.
Yeah.

<i>â™ª She's the kind of lady â™ªâ™ª</i>

ANNA:
<i>The way I see it,</i>

<i>God kind of played a dirty trick on people.</i>

<i>When they're doing things that ain't good for them,</i>

Oh, yeah. Hordes of it.


You know, fun is a big part of why we are here.

But this is a big trip for
Guess. We have investors here.

There are publicists.

Being the face of a company,
Anna, is a full-time job.

You are responsible for making Guess look good.

Well, you know, I've been thinking.

Paw Paw's asked me a few times now to marry him.

I've been thinking it might be best for both of us

if I quit saying no.

What do you think?

I didn't think you were gonna show.

Well, you didn't RSVP.

Well, it just slipped my mind.

Oh, come here.

There's my baby.

Well, you wore white.

You know, you could've done worse.

I mean, sure, he don't look like much

and pushing him around is gonna be boring

but, you know, he's gonna take care of you.

You won't have to do another day's work in your life.

A very important phone call.

Don't mind me.

Danny, come dance with your grandma.

Oh, there's my pumpkin.

Hey, baby. Come here to grandma.

You are so handsome.
I know where you got your looks.

Well, it's my wedding day, and the last I heard of you,

my butt was too big,

and my brain was too small,
and I was no longer your client.

You got an offer to model in the Greek islands.

It's not a small one.

Really?
<i>There is one bugaboo, though.</i>

<i>They want you to start tomorrow.</i>

What?
<i>That's the deal,</i>

but it's a good deal.

If you wanna revive your career,

I wouldn't dream of passing this up.

I'll only be gone for 48 hours

but I'll be thinking of you for every one of them.

Don't cry, Paw Paw.

I'll make it up to you when I come back.

Let's hope I'm still warm.

Oh, don't be silly.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Don't do anything in Greece you shouldn't, Mom.

Love you, pumpkin.

Hi. I'm Howard K. Stern, ...
Hey.

...and I need a discreet table.

I'm meeting Anna Nicole Smith.

Actually, Miss Smith is already here.

Hmm.

ANNA: Mm.
HOWARD: Man.

That is good. Mm.
That's a nice piece of meat.

Hey, look, Anna.
Mm?

I feel I need to be forthright about something, Anna.

Give it a rip.

Well, here's the thing.

My law firm isn't
gonna be able to-- Anna?

Isn't gonna be able to represent you.

I was kind of thinking about leaving anyway.

So I didn't have to focus on any other clients,

and I could just focus on you.

It would be an honor

to take you straight back to the top where you belong.


Howard.

You really mean that?

About it being an honor?

Yes, I do, Anna Nicole Smith.

I do.

So you're asking me

to hitch my wagon to yours, but the question is, Howard,

can your wagon
handle the ride? Hmm?

What's that?

F-U-N.

Fun. Ha-ha-ha.

Mm. Mm.

She's actually--
ANNA: Howard.

Anna.
ANNA: Where have you been?

I'm schmoozing with my new best buddy.

This is Sali Elaha.
He's an indie producer

with a killer,
killer action script that's--

It's almost financed, right?
SALI: Yes.

Almost, yes.
HOWARD: Yeah. Almost financed.

And you're-- It's basically
you in a helicopter--

Helicopters.

You've got guns.
You're the hero.

It's you.
It's the Anna Nicole movie.

SALI: Yes, yes.
HOWARD: Sali. Sali Elaha...

Sali.

...meet Anna Nicole Smith.

I have been fond always

of your celebrity, Miss Anna Nicole.

Howard has been telling me

by looking for
my<i> Skyscraper</i> actress--

The movie's called<i> Skyscraper.</i>
Yes.

It takes place in a skyscraper.
Skyscraper.

That's the type of movie we've been looking for.

That's what we've been talking about.
Yeah.

No, no.

ANNA:
<i>Marilyn got Joe DiMaggio and President J-effing-K.</i>

<i>And I got the two Howards.</i>

Hey, Dad.

How you feeling?

Not so good.

What you got?

I need you to sign some papers for me.

And what would I be signing?

Oh, nothing of any real substance.

Just usual business stuff.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I...


Ah...
It's all right.

Just right here.


And one more right here.

I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

Yeah.

Hi. This is Anna Nicole Smith.

I need to speak to E. Pierce
and I need to speak to him now.

Hello, Anna Nicole.
And how are you today?

My check just bounced.

<i>Oh, yeah. I suppose it did.</i>

<i>I probably should've informed you</i>

that I now have total control of my father's estate.

<i>And just an FYI.</i>
<i>If you don't like it,</i>

you can shove it in whatever orifice you see fit.

J. Howard promised me
50 times

he was gonna take care of me and Danny.

Not to mention what it could do to our company.

I mean, worst comes, we got to finance our own movie.

We can't do it
without J. Howard's money.

And he always said he wanted to help me with my career.

If you don't have some evidence

to back up what you're saying,

it really doesn't matter how sincere it is.

You know, it's not gonna mean anything.

Paw Paw?

I just need you to tell me

what you've always been telling me, Paw Paw.

Can you do that for me?

Tell me how you're gonna take care of me and Danny?

Just speak the words.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You've missed your big rosebuds, haven't you, Paw Paw?

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Just talk about me and Danny.

Mother?

Is that you, Mother?

Where have you been, Mother?

â™ª Amazing grace
How sweet the sound â™ª

â™ª That saved a wretch like me â™ª

â™ª I once was lost
But now I'm found â™ª

â™ª Was blind
But now can see â™ª


That was a beautiful service, Anna.

J. Howard would've
loved it.

Yeah.

I've had a writ printed up

to begin proceedings to get you the money that you need

to support you and Daniel.
All you got to do is sign.

Jeez, Howard.
Look, Anna,

E. Pierce is already moving
on the legal front.

And if we don't, you and Daniel

are gonna be left out in the cold.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ANNA:
<i>I guess being a wife don't account for much.</i>

<i>For the next 10 years,</i>

<i>E. Prick kept fighting Howard</i>
<i>with all those lawyers</i>

<i>and made damn sure Danny and me never saw one red cent</i>

<i>of Paw Paw's billions.</i>

HOWARD:
Thanks for talking to me today.

So I've been spending a lot of time

with Anna Nicole recently.

I don't know how much you know,

but I handle her legally. Heh.

And her life, it's pretty interesting.

You know, she certainly speaks to men.

She doesn't even
have to speak. Heh.

We have funny, heh, banters and things.

Danny, her boy, is great.

He's terrific, and he's real funny and just a sweet kid.

Not camera-shy at all.

They have a real funny...

And then you have just--
You have a dog.

Anyway, he's-- She's...

He is great.

Not an overstatement to say
you'd have the next Osbournes.

With Anna as the Oz.

Busty Oz.

DIRECTOR:
Action.

This is it, J. Howard,
our new home.

Danny.

You want to show J. Howard
our new house?

No, I don't, and I'm not doing this.

DIRECTOR:
Cut. Cut.

Are you gonna talk to him or am I?

Yeah, I'll talk to him.

We need to have more cooperation out of you.

DANNY: This is bogus.
Mom, I don't want to do this.

Get that thing out of my face,
okay? I'm talking to my son.

DIRECTOR: Come on, come on.
ANNA: It's not that big a deal.

You were walking around
with J. Howard's remains.

Talking to him like he's still alive,

and we look like a bunch of freaks.

We do not, and I love Paw Paw.
They got us this house.

They're giving us money.

What do you want from me?
Fine.

Then do it, but just do it without me, okay?

Danny, that's not really an option.

Because Howard already told them
that it's me, you, and him.

You know, we're an eccentric, lovable family.

And, you know, Howard thinks

this show could get me a star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Okay, but Howard just tells you
what you want to hear, Mom.

Oh, come on, Danny. That's not
true. I tell him what to do.

Do you realize you and a camera
are like a moth and a flame?

What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

I'm sorry. He's shy.

Look, Anna, it's gonna be okay.
I promise.

Maybe Danny's right.
Little much with the ashes.

Anna, you got to trust us on this.

Nobody wants normal.

Your life, the audience wants it bigger than life.

Funny, outrageous, the foibles of life

that someone as glamorous as you

that reached the peaks you've reached

can have moments that are
as down-to-earth as any of us.

That's what they wanna see.
HOWARD: Remember in the pilot

when you got your fanny stuck under the table

like Winnie the Pooh?
Adorable.

That made me look like a porker pig.

HOWARD: No, Anna. Camera loves you.
It always has.

The goofy thing, that's just another side

of the small-town girl

from small-town Texas that
everybody fell in love with.

Because I'm goofy.
HOWARD: Yeah.

Let's create some movie magic.

WAITER: Got cheese for you.
Got some drinks with it.

WOMAN 1: You want pizza?
WOMAN 2: Yeah.

[BURPS THEN WHOOPS]

WOMAN 3: Hot.
ANNA: I win.

All right, you win.

I have to pee.

Yeah. I'm sure you have to pee.

Oh, what, you don't trust me, Howard?

No, no. Go pee.

You think I'm cheating?

A coincidence that you're getting up.

Howard, you're stupid.

Calm down.

That's just an eating contest.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ANNA:
<i>When you've got your foot jammed</i>

<i>on the self-destruct pedal</i>
<i>hard as I did,</i>

<i>warning signs, even from yourself, often go unheeded.</i>

I talked to the doctors and they
say your mom's got something

called borderline personality disorder.

"Borderline" my butt.

So are they gonna keep her in there a while?

Well, I think they wanna do a full detox,

you know, so that could be
like eight weeks or maybe more.

Yeah. I bet that'll do
wonders for your TV show.

You know, Danny, I'm really sorry that this is going on

with your mom, you know?

Yeah, well, she was messing herself up

long before she ever ran into you, so...

We don't allow smoking in the meeting room.

Well, you should.
Well, we don't.

You know, I am not the one that is locked in here.

She doesn't look like my daughter.

Doesn't have my daughter's name,
doesn't talk like my daughter.

And she does not behave the way I raised my daughter.

I mean, do you have any idea how hard it is

for me to sit here next to my daughter,

knowing what my daughter has come to?

Oh, don't you dare talk about me like I'm not here, Mama,

like I'm not noticed.

Because guess what, Mama,

that's the one thing I am now, is noticed.

Good or bad, I am noticed!


COUNSELOR: I said no smoking.
ANNA: God!

So, what do you wanna tell your mother, Anna?

Well, there's no sense in you just slobbering through it.

Go on.

I just want you to love me.

I loved you.

And I loved her way more than my mama ever loved me.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

DANNY:
Come on. Come on.

Come on. Are you serious?

You look like you're gonna vomit right now.

Oh, I can't.
That wasn't even a full lap.

Danny, we did the whole
half-circle.

That was not
the whole half-circle.

Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

You know why I'm doing this to you, right?

Because you love me?

DANNY:
Because I love to see you in pain.

ANNA:
That's not nice, Danny.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[ANNA GIGGLING]

Like my body? Want my body?

TrimSpa, baby. TrimSpa, baby.

Want my body? TrimSpa, baby.

TrimSpa, baby.

I can't sleep. I get everything
I need to get done by noon

so I'm just kind of sitting here
waiting for the phone to ring.

But I'm almost afraid if it does.

My pursuit of fame and fortune hasn't exactly

<i>helped keep me straight.</i>

<i>And Danny still lives with me,</i>

but he's almost already out the door.

I know.
That leaving-the-nest thing

sneaks up quicker than it seems right.

Wait till you get to be my age.

You don't know what lonely is.

Oh, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

Well, I don't know exactly what
you're gonna do either, baby.

But you were happy at some point, weren't you?

Yeah, I guess.

Well, then, little girl,

maybe you're gonna find it again.

[HOWARD MOANS]

[HOWARD GRUNTS]

Anna.

What's going on?

Well, I was just thinking, maybe we should.

Anna.

Anna, what's really going on?

I wanna make a baby, Howard.

Well...

Yeah. Yeah.
I don't-- I don't--

Anna, I don't know if now is really a good time

for you to be getting pregnant, you know?

I don't think we can...

You know, with your career and--
I barely have a career.

Before Danny leaves me, I wanna make a baby.

I don't wanna be alone.

Anna, you're never gonna be
alone. I'm always gonna be here.

I know. I just-- The only time
I've ever really been happy

is when I've had someone who needed me.

And I want my little girl, Howard.

I just don't know if now's the best time

for you to be getting pregnant.
