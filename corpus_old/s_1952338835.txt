Who cut these this morning?

Sinh's station.

Sinh's station.

Sinh.

Who cut these this morning?

Who?

Me.

You, Thuy?

You measured all wrong.

25 centimeters.

You know this!

Measure again.

How much?

20 centimeters.

What are you going to do now?

I have a shipment
going out tomorrow.

Where's your head?

I'm sorry.

You're so useless.

I'm sorry.
I'll pay for it.

Pay with what?

Pay with what?

Back to work!

There's nothing to look at.

I'm so tired of you!!

Stand here and listen to me.

You have to be more careful
with the work.

Our jobs depend on everyone
doing things right.

I'm trying to teach you
something.

Yes, Uncle.

Do you think...

that you can survive out there
by yourself?

I guarantee...

you wouldn't last day.

Your mom and dad are gone.

Do you understand me?

Yes, Uncle.

I'm all you have now.

Don't ever forget that.

When are you coming back?

I don't know.

Hold on a second.

This is for you.

Le Le Hotel.
District 1.

Hey, Mr. Elephant!
Mr. Elephant!

How old are you,
Mr. Elephant?

How old are you?

Do you go to school,
Mr. Elephant?

Do you go to school?

How's my old friend today?

I know... I miss her too.

I don't think
she's coming back.

It's just you and me.

Lan!
Hello, you two.

How's it going?
Good.

How's Hanoi?
Same as always.

How long are you staying
this week?

Till Friday.

Friday? That short?

Can't you stay longer?
We'll go out.

I have to go back to work.

Room 701, right?

Very good.

Thanks again.

Ask her.

She wants
to ask you something.

Just ask me.

You come here every week.

Almost two months now.

But you don't get messages
from a husband or boyfriend.

That's right.

You're a pretty woman.

Very pretty.
With a good job.

You should have
a lot of admirers.

But you're always alone.

Maybe you're too choosy.

No one will have me.

Our cousin is really nice.

He's a real gentleman.

He has a job with the city.

He knows magic.

Magic?

Yeah, he's really good at it.
Really?

Thanks. I'm okay.

I'll get my suitcase upstairs.
Of course.

Magic? Are you nuts?

He knows magic.

He's lousy at it.

I think he's pretty good.

Hello, sir.

What are you doing?
Just making tea.

Have a seat.

You need to find
a bigger place.

You can't live like this
forever.

Thanks, but it's good enough
for me.

You know... I knew your father.

He was a good man.

Always took care
of the animals.

They were his family.

Please have some tea.

Times are changing.

The city is growing fast.

The zoo isn't making
any money.

The operating costs
are getting high.

The zoo isn't supposed
to make money.

I work for the interest
of the zoo.

It's my job
to bring revenue.

But I came
with good news today.

A zoo in India wants to buy
the baby elephant.

They'll pay a good sum.

That elephant's been here
his whole life.

This is the only home
he knows.

He will learn to adapt.

Animals learn to adapt.

The other zoo might take
better care of him.

It's business.
You understand.

Good day.

Are you looking for work?

Do you have any money?

40,000 dong.

That's all.

I spent it on the boat
to get here.

Buy some postcards
from the woman there.

Sell them back
for twice as much.

That gives you 80,000.

Keep 10,000 for food.
Buy more cards with the rest.

You need money to make money.

Okay, you can go now.

I'm sorry.

Sorry about what?

I hear things.
I know about your fiancée.

I'll see you on Thursday.

What do you want?

I just want to see Phuong.

She doesn't want to see you.

Who says I can't see her?

I say it.

Listen.

I don't want to see your face
here again.

I'm not scared of you.

Just remember.

Postcards?

Postcards?

Postcards?

Postcards?

Are you lost?

No.

Just waiting for someone
to take me to lunch.

If you had your wish,
what would you eat?

Pork chops on rice.
With egg rolls.

Maybe finish it off
with chocolate ice cream.

Noodle soup!

Noodle soup!

Want noodle soup?

How much?

5,000 a bowl.

You haven't sold
any cards today?

Follow me.

The first one
is on the house.

Let's go.

Hurry up.
Don't be so proud.

Here. Eat up.

You from the countryside?

Just outside the city.

You're out of money.

I spent it on the postcards.

Why don't you sell roses?

Roses?

Yeah.

Lots of people buy roses.

Outside restaurants
and cafes.

Men in the city...

like to impress women.

If you want me to help you,
I could take you there.

There's a woman in charge
of all the flower girls.

She's always looking
for new workers.

Here.
Pour this in the soup.

You sell each one for 10,000.
You keep 3,000.

7,000 goes back to me.

Go to De Tham Street
to see the other girls.

They'll show you what to do,
okay?

Yes, ma'am.

This one looks your size.

The roses won't be good
tomorrow.

You have to sell
them all tonight.

What if I can't?

Then you go hungry.

Fresh roses, mister.

I'm not buying.

Just buy one, mister.
Only 10,000 each.

I'm not buying.

Help me pay
for my schoolbooks, mister.

Okay, give me one.

Thank you, mister.

You make it look easy.

It's easy
if you know what to say.

People feel sorry
for little girls

if they have a story.

Do you have a story?

What if I can't think of one?

You have to think of one.

What if I can't?

Then you go hungry.

Two bowls, Mom.

You like the soup, miss?

It's good.
Not too salty.

That's right.
Not too salty.

It's the best soup in town.

You'll tell your friends
to come, right?

Fresh roses, miss?

No, thanks.

Buy one for your husband.

I don't have a husband.

Then for your boyfriend.

I don't have a boyfriend.

How many
have you sold tonight?

It's my first night
on the job.

I didn't have a story
to tell people.

But now I do.

What do you tell them?

I tell them
it's my birthday.

And it's not your birthday?

My birthday's next month.

You shouldn't tell lies.

You try selling roses
on the streets.

Want some noodle soup?

Another bowl of soup here!

I'll take two roses.

I thought you said
you didn't have a boyfriend.

You need the business.

Thanks again.

Good day.

Seen this girl
around the neighborhood?

No, sir.

Are you sure?

Thanks anyway.

Hello, girls.
Can you help me?

Have you seen this girl
around the neighborhood?

No, sir.

Are you sure?

Noodle soup, anyone?

Seen this girl around?

Not her.

Are you sure?

I'm sure.

I know all the girls
in the neighborhood.

I've never seen this one.

You're not lying to me?
No, sir.

Want some yummy noodle soup?

Little girl!

Don't feed it that!

Elephants like sugarcane.

Little kids like to feed it
sugarcane.

Go ahead and feed it.

Give him one.

I'll help you.

I saw you selling postcards
at the gate yesterday.

I sell roses now.

You work here at the zoo?

Yeah.

I take care of the animals.

You like elephants?

Elephants are cute.

You know, the cutest animals
can be the most dangerous.

A lot of visitors

are accidentally killed
by elephants.

If you get too close,
they will crush you flat.

Here, take one.
I have to go back to work.

Still here?

See those birds over there?

Their beaks are like razors.

And those tigers over there.

They look peaceful,
but they'll rip your head off.

What about pigs?

Farm pigs are harmless.

But wild pigs are vicious.

Don't you have
to go to school?

No.

You're wearing
a school uniform.

I have to for my work.

Don't you have more flowers
to sell?

I have a lot of work to do.

All right.

Down, boy!

Have a seat.

Don't be scared.
He won't bite.

You're not married?

You ask a lot of questions.

I'm sorry.

I was planning
on getting married last month.

To the woman in the photo?

Yeah.
Her name's Phuong.

I don't like Phuongs.

Phuongs are all liars.

I have a friend name Phuong.

She always steals money
from her mom's purse.

My Phuong...

is no liar.

She just changed her mind.

She'll change it back.

Women change their minds
all the time.

Eat up.

Not hungry?

Your monkey's crazy.
Oh, yeah?

My two cousins at the hotel
talk about you all the time.

Lan, the flight attendant...

always coming,
always going.

Your cousins are sweet.

They say you work
for the city?

At the office,
I process papers.

It's okay, I guess.

I send money to my mother
every month.

The oldest son has to take care
of the family.

Do you have family in Saigon?

My parents live in Nha Trang.

Your perfume
smells so good to me.

What I mean is...

you're so pretty.

Prettier than my cousins
told me.

I'm having a good time
sitting with you.

I hear you do magic?

Magic...

I do it for fun
at birthday parties.

At friends' weddings too.

Just one moment.

Please pick a card.

Don't let me see it.

Put it back in the deck.

Is it this one?

Sorry, I have to go
to the ladies' room.

<i>The number you dialed
is not in service...</i>

You didn't say good-bye.

I'm sorry.
I'm not good at this.

You're not attracted to me.
I understand.

No...

you're a nice guy.

You have a nice job.

There's somebody else, right?

That's okay.
You don't have to tell me.

There will be some girl...

you'll make very happy.

Good night.

How was your date tonight?

How do you know
I was on a date?

I can smell your perfume.

Well, I'm sitting here
alone at midnight.

I know a man
who's really nice.

I know for a fact
he's not married.

But...

he's just a little strange.

I'm not what men want.

You're pretty.
You have a job.

What man doesn't want that?

I'm difficult to understand.

Anyway, I'm leaving soon.

You're leaving?

For work.

I fly to Hanoi on Friday.

What time?

3:00.

72 minus 5 times 60...

What are you doing?

That's 4,020 minutes
till you leave.

I bet you find someone
before then.

You want to bet me?

Do you have a place
to sleep tonight?

Sure. Next to the river.

You sleep by the river?

Sometimes.

You don't have friends
in the city?

Any family?

How much do you pay
for this room?

The company pays.

They pay
for you to stay here?

There's toothpaste
on the sink.

Go rinse your mouth.

I'll sleep on the floor.

You'll sleep on the bed
like normal people.

I'm used to the floor.

It's good for the back.

Thuy. I want to help you.

You deserve better things.

Everyone deserves
a real bed.

You can sleep here
anytime you want.

It's time for bed.

Thank you, Miss Lan.

For what?

You're kind to me.

A lot of people in the city
aren't so kind.

You have a good heart.

That's the most important thing.

Now close your eyes.

Dream something nice.

I don't know what I'll do
when you're gone.

First it was Phuong.

Now it's your turn.

Everyone leaves.

Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

They want to take you
away from me.

Thuy!

What are you doing?

I'm sorry.

You have to respect
my things!

I just wanted to see...

See what?

How it feels
to be a grown-up.

You don't want to be
like me.

But you're pretty.

You're just a little girl.

You should stay that way
as long as you can.

Is it good?

I have a gift.

I've never been on a plane.

Most people haven't.

What's your job like?

I make sure everyone
has their seat belts on.

I serve them drinks.

I try not to spill drinks
on them.

Do you make a lot of money?

You ask a lot of questions.

That's what Mr. Hai says.

Who's Mr. Hai?

He works at the zoo.

Do you like animals?

Of course.

What's your favorite?

I like giraffes...

No, wait. Sparrows.

Mr. Hai is like an owl.

He's very wise.

How do you know he's wise?

He talks to the animals.

An owl and a sparrow.

Good afternoon.

Can I help you?

Please...

my niece is lost
in the city somewhere.

I thought
she might end up here.

Here she is.

No. Not this girl.

Are you sure?

Can you take a good look?

I'm sure.
But you must know...

there are five other
orphanages in the city.

If she shows up here...

please call this number.

Bamboo blinds?

That's right.
The finest quality.

Thank you, ma'am.

I was wondering
if I'd see you around.

I've been working.

How's the flower business?

Better than postcards.

He'd have more space to play
in the jungle.

I've raised this elephant
since he was a baby.

I know everything he does.

This is his home.

But now the city wants
to sell him to a zoo in India.

That's not fair.
They can do that to him.

They can do what they want.

The city owns the zoo.

They could sell
all the animals here.

They could build
a golf course.

We're just little people,
you and me.

What if you paid them?
Could you keep the elephant?

Do you know how much
an elephant costs?

You have a lot of spirit.

Do you like tigers?

Sure, I like tigers.

See?
Tigers are my friends.

But what I really want
is a girlfriend.

I'm so lonely inside.

Wait!
You're moving too fast.

You don't have
to be afraid of me.

What are you doing in there?
Nothing.

I have to buy food
for the elephants.

I could use your help.

I can pay you a little.

Hop on.

Put this on.

Air pollution kills
more than 20,000 people a year.

Here we are.
Hello, there.

Only little bananas
for the elephants.

Do they have to be ripe?

Not too ripe
so they don't go bad.

Why are we stopping here?

I'm sure
she has a new boyfriend.

I can feel it.

Who are you talking about?

Hold on a second.

Let me buy your roses.

I need you to give her
these roses for me.

No!

I won't do it.

Help me out here.

I can't do it.

Why won't you help me?

She's no good.

She broke your heart once.
She'll do it again.

I know how women are.

Just help me this once.

Find out if she has
a new boyfriend.

How do I do that?

See how she looks
when you give her these.

Does she smile?
Does she look sad?

You said you know
how women are?

Remember.
Don't tell her it's from me.

This is the newest model.
Lots of features.

It does video and pictures.

You have others?
Of course.

This one's even newer.

Sharp pictures and video...

How much?

Only 5.9 million dong.

Too much.
I can lower it.

Hold on. Wait.

I'm not buying flowers.
Go sell them somewhere else.

I'm not selling.

You're here to buy a phone?

I'm not buying a phone.
I'm delivering these.

No card?

A secret admirer?

I can't tell you.

Maybe it's from your boyfriend.

I don't have a boyfriend.

I have to get back
to work now.

So?

It's done.

What did she say?

She said nothing.

What do you mean, nothing?

Does she have
a new boyfriend?

Tell me!

Yes.

Yes what?

She has a new boyfriend.

She told you that?

I tried to tell you.
You wouldn't listen.

She's no good.

She's no good for you!

You don't smile anymore.

You're cold now.

I'm older now.

When I first met you...

you were so nervous.

It was your first day
training with the airline.

3,000 meters up high...

walking down the aisles...

always with a smile
on your face.

You were just a young girl.

Naïve... but stubborn.

And you were the captain.

What's wrong?

You should give it
to her instead.

Who?

Your wife!

You want me to leave her?

Would that make you happy?

I'm leaving.

She's probably waiting
for you.

You ever think of meeting
a new woman?

Let's eat out tonight.

Goat hot pot!

I know a really good place.

The big place
on Ha Ba Trung Street.

So...

what are you going to do now?

I'm going out tonight.

I'm treating myself
to a nice dinner.

How long can you keep
selling roses?

I don't know.

How long till you stop?

One week...

one month...

one year?

I don't know.

Listen to me.

I have a friend.

She works at a home.

For young girls like you.

Young girls who need help.

They have books.

They have clothes.

An orphanage! You want
to send me to an orphanage.

You won't have to sleep
in the streets.

You want to lock me up
like one of your animals.

Thuy!

You said I could
sleep here anytime.

I didn't mean
in front of the door!

Are you mad at me?

I'm tired.

Is it a boy problem?

You have to learn
not to ask so many questions.

I'm sorry.

Who are you running from?

I'm not running from anyone.

Don't lie to me.

I'm not lying.

Are you in trouble?

I'm sorry I bothered you.

Thuy!

Don't go.

I won't trouble you anymore.

You don't trouble me.

I'm just having a bad day.

We should go out to eat.
You'll feel better.

I don't think that'll help.

Goat hot pot!
I know a a good place. My treat.

You have money
for goat hot pot?

Business is good.

He's here.

Who?
Mr. Hai!

Miss Lan!
This is Mr. Hai.

He works at the...

I work in management.

Management?

Let's eat.

Let me serve you.

Have you been flying long?

Four years now.

It's a regular job.

Are you afraid?

Working high up.
Things could happen.

Things could happen
anytime, anywhere.

Excuse me.

Are you okay?

No...

I just need to wash my face.

Come up and sing.

Oh, no. I can't.

One song! One song!

Relax.

Relax!

Relax.

Relax. Calm down.

She's just a girl.

Does she ever talk
about her parents?

They're in heaven now.

That's all I know.

There's over 8 million people
living in this city.

You ever feel so small
in this world?

When I'm in the sky
looking down.

I can look down
and see fields of rice.

I can see people.

They don't know
I'm watching them.

They're so small...
like ants.

When I look closer,
I can see faces.

Old women working
in the fields.

Children playing
with buffalos.

Sisters holding hands.

Like God... looking down
on his children.

I'm no God.

I'm just a girl.

26 years old.

Still looking
for a fairy tale.

People look at me and ask...

why I'm alone.

I tell them...

I don't know what I want.

I'm... I'm sorry.

I don't work in management.

I know.

I know you work at the zoo.

I'm sorry...

I didn't tell you the truth.

Just don't lie to me again.

Have you seen
this girl around?

No, sir.

Don't go on the streets.
How come?

They're checking for papers.
What?

Don't follow me!

Thuy?

Have you seen
the little girl?

Who?
The little flower girl.

Have you seen her?

Thanks anyway.

You like dolls?

You're too big
to play with dolls.

I've seen her on the street
selling roses.

She's got money, then.

I have no money.

Are you sure?

I told you no.

Let's see.

Promise me...

you won't let anyone
hurt me.

Promise me.
I promise.

Hi. I would have called.
I didn't have your number.

I don't have a phone.

Please come in.

Sorry, my place is a mess.

That's okay.

You've lived here long.

My father was the zookeeper
for many years before he died.

I grew up
with these animals.

You like them
more than people.

That's what they say.

Please have some tea.

I wanted to tell you...

I think
you're a good person.

I see the way
Thuy follows you.

She looks up to you.

She even tells me
she talks to the animals.

What are you looking at?

You have an honest face.

Anyone ever told you that?

Never.

Thank you.

Have you seen Thuy?

They took her away.

What?

The city man took her away.

What man?

She got caught.
They took her to an orphanage.

Thanks a lot.

Give it back!

Give it back!

You are here to claim Thuy?

Yes.
Yes.

Are you the mother and father?

Yes.
No.

Yes.
No.

Yes or no?

Not officially.

Then you have no claim.

She doesn't have family.
We're the only ones she knows.

How do you know
she doesn't have family?

She told me.

You believe everything
a little girl tells you?

She wouldn't lie about that.

Even if I wanted,
I couldn't release her to you.

You're not family.

We have to follow rules.

Good day.

Someone called.
Told me my niece is here.

Her name is Thuy.

I'm her uncle.

This couple have come
to claim her.

I don't know these people.

I don't know who they are.

Do you have proof
that you're her uncle?

I'm a factory manager
in Bien Hoa.

I'm very respected in town.
I need proof.

Of course.

My name is Tran Le Minh.

Her father was my brother,
Tran Loc Minh.

Here's his death certificate.

Thuy.

Your uncle is here
to take you home.

Do you want to go home?

Of course
she wants to go home.

She can speak for herself.

She's afraid.

Excuse me.

Are you family?

I don't think so.

It's not your business.

She wouldn't have run
if she wasn't scared.

Who are you, woman?

Thuy, your uncle
wants to take you home.

Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

Look at her.
She's afraid.

Thuy!
Sorry.

We have to follow rules.

I'm not going!

I'm so sorry.

Let me go.
I'm not going!

I'm not going!
I'm not going!

Thuy!

Where's the change?

Sorry, I forgot.

Hey!

Sit down.

I'm not done talking.

I understand
why you left me.

But you embarrassed me.

People in the neighborhood
are talking.

Hey!

Are you listening?

I want some respect.

Look at me
when I'm talking.

Look at me!

You know about respect?
Yes.

Stupid girl!

They're coming next week
to take you away.

Tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

I can't do that.

I can't set you free.

Maybe...

they'll give you
a better home.

Thuy! Thuy!

How'd you get in?

You didn't lock the door.

What's that?

Money... to keep the elephant.

Where did you get this?

Is it enough
to keep the elephant?

Did you steal it?

I didn't steal it.

I worked at Uncle's factory.

He owes me this money.

It's not yours.

This is wrong!

We have to give it back.

He owes me this money!

It's not yours!

He owes me!

He probably called the cops!

I'm sure they're looking
for you!

Why did you do
such a stupid thing?

I did it for you.

I know you love
that elephant.

It's okay.

You tried
to do something good.

You know it's wrong, right?

You know we have
to give it back.

Wait here.

Write down his address.

Write down his address.

Write it down.

You don't know my uncle.

He has a bad temper.

You're in a lot of trouble.

Write it down
so I can fix it.

Take the pen!

Write it!

Sir.

The money's all here.

It belongs to you.

Where is she?

She's safe.

Actually...

she got the money...

to buy an elephant.

An elephant?

Is this some kind of joke?

She's a good girl.

She's got a good heart.

A grown man like yourself.

What are you doing
with a ten-year-old girl?

Please.

I'd like to propose something.

If you will listen.

Maybe...

I can help you.

Maybe...

we can help each other.

Will you listen?

She can live at the zoo.

I'll train her to work there.

She'll attend school.

No. No way.

She works here with me.
At the factory.

What's she going to do
at school?

She's useless.

She's not useless.

Her head's not there.

Always dreaming.

She talks to dolls
like a crazy person.

The zoo would pay me.

In turn, I will pay you.

You'd pay me?

That's right.
Every month.

Every month?

I tried to do something
to keep you.

But I messed up.

You make Mr. Hai happy.

He should be happy.

I think Ms. Lan
would make him happy.

What do you think?

You think so, too?

He likes you.

The way he looks at you.

He's sad.
He doesn't want to leave.

He'll make new friends.

How would you like
to work here?

I can't pay you much.

You'd have to work till dark.

At night, you'd have
to do homework.

You can't be lazy.

But Uncle Minh.

I took care of it.

What did you do?
Did you hurt him?

I didn't hurt him.

You don't have to worry
about him.

Aren't you happy?

I don't know.

You don't know what?

I don't want to let you down.

I don't know
why you help me.

You're not useless.

I know this.

Three bundles
of bananas, please.

Where's Hai today?
You're here alone?

I'm buying bananas today.
I work for the zoo now.

Really?

Get back safe.
Yes. Bye.

Excuse me.
Is Miss Lan here?

She's out, sweetie.

She's leaving today.

You have nothing to say?

What do you want me to say?

You don't miss her?

A woman like her...

they don't end up
with men like me.

How do you know?

Take a look at me.

I wear a bargain watch.

I wear bargain shoes.

I have one good shirt.

I see the way
she looks at you.

Forget it.
It's over now.

We have to think
about us now.

We have to think
about the future.

You're the one that's running.

Here are the keys.

We'll see you next week.

Same time.

Same time.

There's a package for you.

Thanks.

Good-bye.
Have a good trip.

I'll see you next week.

Please pick a card.

Is it this one?

Yes.

Thank you.
Good-bye.

What's wrong?

Give me a minute.

We only have 20 minutes.

I need a minute.

Don't be late.

<i>Miss Lan...</i>

<i>I know you're leaving today.</i>

<i>If you're in the sky...</i>

<i>when you read this...</i>

<i>I want you to look down
to the city...</i>

<i>and look for me.</i>

<i>I'll be looking up
at the same time.</i>

<i>I want you to know
the last few days...</i>

<i>have been happy times for me.</i>

<i>I won't forget how kind
you've been to me.</i>

<i>Mr. Hai says animals
are like people.</i>

<i>They feel lonely too.</i>

<i>But I want to tell you
something.</i>

<i>I hope...</i>

<i>you're reading this letter.</i>

<i>You...you're family to me.</i>
