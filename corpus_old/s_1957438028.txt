Liz: Merry Christmas,
Ms. Benson.

Luke: And thanks
for the cookies!

Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
And you're welcome.

Tell your mom we're super
excited to see

what she's come up
this year, Liz!

Bye!

<i> ["Joy to The World"</i>
<i> Instrumental]</i>
<i> â™ª</i>

Hi Dad!

Look out, Mary.

You're about to be boarded
by a group of scallywags!

There's my little helper.

Did you start without me?

I wouldn't dream of it.

Dad taught me how to tie
six knots

before he shipped out
this time.

Good, 'cause I'm gonna need your
help once we hit the open water.

No one's gonna stand a chance
against us this year.

Oh, I didn't realize winning the
parade was so important to you.

Well, that's the whole point,
right?

Think again, little lady.


Ok, guys, family picture time.

Let's go!

Luke?

<i> Liz: Come on, Luke!</i>

We said a family picture.
Get over here.

Here we go.

In one, two, three.

<i>["Joy to The World instrumental]</i>
<i> â™ª</i>

â™ª

When you sleep,

do you dream of sugar plum
fairies and candy cane castles?

You know what, Erica,
sometimes I do.

Ah, yeah.

Ah, decorated trees
in the courtyard?

Check.

Snow frosting
on the windows?

Check.

Main lobby display?

Check.

And one more thing.

Have you changed your plans
for Christmas?

No.

'Cause if it were me,
I'd already be in Hoboken

with my mom eating chocolate
and binging as many baking shows

as we can get out sticky
little paws on.

That is because you and your
mom are like best friends.

-Whereas my dad and I are...
-Not so much.

Guys, we're leaning
a little to the right.

â™ª

Well look, Mom,
I still got it.

That's because you had
a good teacher.

Oh, maybe it's because of my
innate sense of style and taste.

Aren't you wearing
the same outfit

I bought you two years ago?

True, but I dressed myself.

Ok. So, what else can I
help you with?

Nothing, you've done more
than enough.

I mean, you really shouldn't
unload all of this by yourself.

Luke...

I've got plenty of time.

No, I can handle it.

Don't keep him waiting.

All right, if you need
anything else.

I'm sure I have your number,
somewhere.

Alright.

I'll see ya.

Have you heard from our team
at the convention Centre?

They're just putting out
the centerpieces now.

Right on schedule.

Can you put some holly in these,
please?

Thank you.

You'd really rather spend
Christmas at a hotel in Seattle

than at home in Portside?

It's a really nice hotel.

Besides, it won't be forever.

As soon as the insurance money
from the fire comes in

I can finally start
the repairs.

So you're ok?

Yes. Yes.

I have so much to be
grateful for.

I have an incredible daughter,
a job that I love,

an amazing friend
who cares about me.

What more could a girl
ask for?

Two black coffees and a little
something sweet.

Thank you so much, Joyce.

You know, our niece is visiting
this Christmas.

That must be so nice for you,
Arthur.

She sure would like someone

to go to the winter ball
with her, hmm?

Well, you know, if she is half
the woman you are, Marsha,

I'm sure she'll have
no trouble

finding someone to take her.

Thanks, Joyce.

-Good luck!
-Won't need it!

-Merry Christmas to ya.
-Merry Christmas!

You are falling right
into my trap.


Boom!

Really?

Oh yeah, that happened.

Check mate.


Really thought today
was gonna be my day.

Oh, well, it could have been
if you hadn't spent

so much time protecting
your rook.

The rook is the best piece.


Again?

[phone rings]

Oh, lunch break is over.

Hey, can you do me a quick
favor on your way home?

Can you stop by
the Christmas market

and make sure Mom set up
the stall ok?

Yeah, all right.

And I will get you next week.

Yeah, I've heard that before.

All right, Dennis.

â™ª

Then our work here is done.

Our busiest Christmas season yet
and it went off without a hitch.

-Hi!
-Mom!

Banana! Hi!


How was your last day?

Mrs. Clarke gave us homework
to hand in when we come back.

Oh, no! How awful.

Right?

It's called Christmas break,
Auntie Erica,

not Christmas work.

So, what do you think?

It's even better than
the last year, Mom!

Yes!

Thank you, sweetheart.

So, are you ready to have
the best Christmas ever?

Yes.

I made something for you.

Hi.

-Hey Carol.
-Hey Dennis.

Wow!

Hey, kid! Look out!

<i> Carol: Dennis!</i>

<i>["We Wish You A Merry Christmas</i>
<i> instrumental]</i>
<i> â™ª</i>

â™ª


Holy moly!

You were too young
to remember much

from the last time
you were there.

No, I remember.

Oh, really?

A little. Not a lot.

This is where the parade goes,
right?

That's right.

On Christmas Eve, the boats sail
through the harbor

and then the judges vote on
who had the best light display.

And you always won.

Not always.

But Grandma was very good
at decorating.

What about Grandpa?
Does he still do the parade?

No, Grandpa sold the boat
after Grandma passed away.

Oh.

"More rapid than eagles
his coursers they came."

"And he whistled, and shouted,
and called them by name!"

Both: Now Dasher! Now, Dancer!
Now Prancer and Vixen!

On, Comet! On, Cupid!
On Donner and Blitzen!

[phone chimes]

Hello?

<i>Hello, Liz, it's Joyce Benson.</i>
<i> I'm calling about your dad.</i>

â™ª

â™ª

Thank you!

I can't believe
we're actually here.

It's going to be exactly
like when you were a kid.

I don't know if it'll be
exactly like that.

Oh, thank you!
And Merry Christmas.

Ok I told Ms. Benson
we would meet her up top.

And if I know Joyce,

she will be waiting
with fresh cookies.

Liz!

Luke!

-Hey, hi stranger.
-Hi.

Hi, hi, hi, hello.

Wow. It's been a while.

You look healthy.

Uh, yeah. Thank you.

You too, you also look healthy,
as well.

Do I look healthy?


Yes, remarkably healthy.

Hi. Sorry, this is my daughter,
Hannah.

Hannah, this is Luke.
We grew up together.

Hi, Hannah, nice to meet you.

I told you it would be just like
when you were a kid.

Um, I would love to stay
and catch up

but we better run,
our ride is waiting.

Oh, shoot, I was supposed to...

Ta da.

Joyce got caught up with
some stuff at the bakery

and she asked me to do her
a favor, so, here I am.

You shall be riding with me.

-Ok.
-Ok.

Ok.

Right this way.

So were you there this morning
when the tree fell?

No, I wasn't, but I heard
that as things go,

it was lucky your dad swooped in
when he did.

He hasn't given you
the play-by-play?

I actually haven't spoken
to him yet.

Oh. Well, the hotel's talking
about how brave he is.

I bet he hates that.
My Dad, the hero.

Hey, welcome home.

Since when did the parade
have a cash prize?

Has it been that long since
you've been here?

Four years.

Well, we've been doing it
for three years

and the mayor thought
if she offered

a cash prize it would attract
more tourists.

Well, it seems to be working

'cause the harbor has way more
boats than I remember.

$25,000 grand, huh?

Don't you start getting
any ideas?

I don't even think your mom
could get the boat ready
in time,

especially considering the shape
it's in.

What did you say?

Oh, no, don't get me wrong.

If anybody could get
the boat ready...

No, no, no, no, no.

It would be your mom, 'cause
she was the absolute best...

You said with the shape
it's in?

Yeah.

It's still down there?

Of course. It's never
gone anywhere.

Hannah, come on.

Where are you going?

Ok, well, we don't,
I just, uh. I don't...

Ok.

Not quite how you remember it,
is it?

Not exactly.

Are you sure this is
the right one?

Why would your dad tell you
he sold it?

That's a good question.

â™ª

Ok, you got it from here?

Yep. What do you say?

Thanks for the ride, Mr. Luke.
Merry Christmas.

Very merry Christmas to you too,
Miss Hannah.

And I'm sure I'll be seeing
both of you around town.

Yeah. Thanks again.

Welcome home.

Ok, you ready?
Let's do this.


-Grandpa!
-Hello.

Merry Christmas, Dad.

Oh hi, kiddo.

I'm just saying,
without a Christmas tree

it's going to be very difficult
for Santa

to know where to put presents
on the big night.

Is that a risk you really
want to take?

I guess I never considered
the consequences.

Hey, Banana?

Why don't you go explore
for a little bit?

Good idea.

I need to know what
we're dealing with here.

So, I hear you're a local
celebrity now?

Bunch of nonsense.
Right place, right time.

Maybe.

How're you feeling?

Oh this? Doc's being
over cautious.

It's a little sore,
that's all.

When Joyce called she said
you needed help.

How are the repairs going
on the house?

We haven't started yet,

but the insurance money
should come through this week.

Well...

You're welcome to stay here
as long as you need.

Thanks.

But we'll only stay until
you're back on your feet.

Gonna be a short visit then.

All the same, I think we'll
stay through Christmas,

just to make sure.

Well, suit yourself,

but you know I don't make
a big deal out of that here.

I know that.

So we stopped by the marina,
on the way here.

You said you were selling
the boat.

I was. I just never
got around to it.

I wish I'd known that
you changed your mind.

I didn't change my mind,
I just...

Never got around to it.

<i> Joyce: Merry Christmas!</i>

Oh, boy.

Here you help me with-
You take this.

-Ok.
-Thank you.

You're here! You're here!

Oh, it is so good to see you.

Oh, you too.

I forget how much you
look like your mother.

Big surprise, no tree
upstairs either.

Honey, this is Joyce Benson.

Hi, I'm Hannah.

Yes, you are my dear.
Can I have a hug?

You... you smell like cookies.


That is the best part of
a Ms. Benson hug.

I wish Mary were here
to see this.

The Darling family
back together again.

Isn't this great, Dennis?
Oh, well... he's off.

We can have a... cookie?

Mmm.


Uh, Julie was asking about you
last night.

Oh, really?

Yeah, you know. She just
wanted to know

if you had a date to
the winter ball yet.

Your wife and I go through this
ever year.

I know.

I told her you weren't gonna go,
but she can't help it.

She worries about you.

Worries?

What, that I'll get too much
peace and quiet in my life?

Yeah, I worry about you too.

Give me this.

But I know the real reason why
you're not going to the ball.

Oh boy, I can't wait
to hear this one.

You're afraid.

Afraid that I might show you up
on the dance floor.

Wow. Wow.

You know I never knew
why Julie married you,

but now I see it.

Like a moth to a flame,
my friend. Woo!

<i>Hannah: What are you looking at?</i>

Wait, what's up?

<i> Hannah: You did?</i>

You see it?

Huh. Liz Darling?

Yeah.

Hm. I heard she
got in yesterday.

You mean your wife told you
she got in yesterday.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And?

And what?

Just gave her a ride
from the ferry.

Oh, really? Huh.

Hold this, I'll be right back.

<i> Liz: Not too far, Hannah!</i>

Liz! Hey.

-Hi.
-Hi.

So, have you settled back
in to small town living yet?

Not quite.

My dad seems to think that
he's the one taking care of us

instead of the other
way around. So...

Oh yeah.

He's one tough cookie,
your old man.

Yeah.

All I wanted was to give Hannah
a good Christmas this year.

And instead I brought
her to the house where
Christmas goes to die.

Oh.

I mean, just 'cause your dad
stopped celebrating Christmas

doesn't mean the rest
of the town has.

You two should come to the
Christmas market, tonight.

Does your mom still set up
the stall?

Yeah. Every year.

Hey, Mom!

Isn't this Grandpa's place?

Dad's selling the house?

Huh?

Of course, just stay in
the front yard, honey!

<i> Hannah: Ok, mom.</i>

Hey.

First the boat, now this?

Dad, why didn't you tell me
you were selling the house?

I'm not.

The bank is.


What are you doing?

Homework.

Over the holidays?

Tell me about it.

Do you want to take a break?

Cool.

Woah!

That's a projector.

I used that when I taught
geography at the high school.

Now what do you teach?

Nothing anymore.

I stopped working to take care
of your grandma

when she got sick.

I never quite found
my way back.

She was a teacher too,
for kids about your age.

Was she good at it?

Oh, the best.

I bet she never would have given
me homework over Christmas.

No.

You're right. She never
would have done that.

[Hannah giggles]

Do you know how
to play chess?

Would you like to learn?

Yes.

Is this a puppy?

Well, no, it's a knight.

Looks, supposed to look
like a horse,

kind of looks like a puppy.

We'll call it a puppy,
if you want.

Joyce?

Hi, miss! I saw
this at the shop,

just knew exactly
where it belonged.

I sure hope he appreciates
the effort.

Oh, he does.
In his own way.

-We look out for each other.
-Mmm.

I'm guessing you were
at the bank.

How did you...

I happened to see some of those
in the mail last week.

What did they say?

He has until the end of
the month to pay what he owes

or they're going to move
to foreclosure.

I can't come up with this
much money on such short notice.

Well, we'll think of something.

Your turn, Grandpa.

Mmm. Ok.

Here we go.

Go here.

Oh. Ok.

Ok. All right.

No!

Yep. Gone.

Yep, gone.

I got your horse, Grandpa.

So you did, so you did.

Hey, you two.

Mom, Grandpa's teaching
me how to play.

She's got a dangerously
good head for the game.

Well, I don't want to interrupt,

but the Christmas
market's tonight.

Do you want to go?

Yes! Grandpa, are you coming?

No. I don't mix with
all that nonsense.

Oh.

Can we play again tomorrow?

Sure, pieces aren't
going anywhere.

Good.

Oh.


-Go get your coat on.
-Ok.

We'll be back in a couple hours.

â™ª

... Merry Christmas.

Woah! Look who it is!

I like your apron.

It definitely suits you.

Thank you very much.

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

I like it. It's comfortable.

Does this have too much
baby's breath?

Hi Mrs. Fletcher.

<i> Luke: It does have too much</i>
<i> baby's breath.</i>

Hi.

How are you?

-It's so lovely to see you.
-Oh, you too.

Hey, Mom, can we get one
of these for Grandpa?

You know what, Hannah,
that is a great idea.

Oh, no honey.
Family doesn't pay here.

We'll put this aside and you'll
pick it up on your way out.

Thanks. He's gonna love it.

Well look, it's almost time
for the Christmas light up.

Luke, why don't you escort these
lovely ladies

to the hot cocoa stand
before it starts.

All right, well you heard
the lady.

Hot cocoa it is.

-This way.
-Yay!

Thank you. Bye Mrs. Fletcher.

I'm gonna go find Mrs. Benson!

Ok!

So how bad is it?

It's bad. But Dad
won't admit it.

What are you gonna do?

The only thing I can do.

Use the insurance money
to pay off the house?

And you and Hannah
keep living out of a hotel?

I never mentioned the hotel
to you.

Oh, Dennis and I play chess
every week, it came up.

I'm sorry, are you, like,
friends with my dad?

Because that is super weird.

It's a little weird,

but he was such close friends
with my dad, so, I don't know,

I feel like I get to be
a part of it somehow.

Ok. So it is both weird
and very sweet.

About the house,

you just let me know if there
is anything I can do to help.

-Thank you.
-Sure.

Julie: Luke! Liz!

-Hey!
-Hey!

Oh, my gosh!


Oh, my gosh!

I saw the announcement.
The time has flown by.

How far along are you?

I'm seven months

and I'm totally tired of the
whole bowl full of jelly thing.

-You look amazing.
-Thank you.

So, what have you guys
been up to?

So much to catch up on, I bet.

Yeah, you know, I guess.

Hi, you lot.

The tree lighting is gonna
start soon.

Ok.

Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

I'm Mayor Rachel Shoemaker
and it is my honor

to kick off this year's annual
Portside festival of lights!

[cheering and applause]

These contestants will battle
it out on Christmas Eve

for the title of best
decorated deck

and the grand prize
of $25,000!

[cheering and applause]

Contest entry closes tonight.
So this is it folks,

your last chance to cast off
and show us what you can do.

Any takers?

Going once, going twice.

Well, that looks like it, folks.

Wait!

What are you doing?

Something I'll probably regret.

Hi, I would like to sign up
for the parade, please.

Yes!

Ladies and gentlemen,

this competition
just got interesting.

And we can't wait to see
what Elizabeth comes up with.


I hope you know what
you've gotten yourself into.

It's gonna be great.

And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

All: Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five,

four, three, two, one!

[cheering and applause]

â™ª

<i> Grandpa, we're home!</i>

There were carolers and crafts
and we got hot chocolate

and watched the Christmas
tree light up.

Well, I'm, I'm glad you had fun.

We got something
for you too, Grandpa.

Oh.

Well, that's very nice.

Hey, honey, why don't you go
get your PJ's on

and work on your Christmas list?

My daughter was trying to share
something special with you.

I don't, I don't know what
you're talking about.

Yes, you do.

Please don't take Christmas away
from her like you did for me.

You were the one who stopped
coming for Christmas.

And why do you think that was,
Dad?

Look around this place.

You took all Mom's decorations,
every good memory,

and you shoved them
away somewhere.

I don't want to talk about this.

Of course, you don't.

Before you hear it
from someone else,

you should know that I signed up
for the parade.

Absolutely not.

-We will do all the work.
-No.

-Dad, Mom would want us...
-No!

I'm not asking permission, Dad.


Mom, if you are listening,
we are gonna need some help.


<i> ["Oh Come All Ye Faithful"</i>

<i> â™ª</i>

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

[crashing sounds]

[Liz grunts]

Good morning.

I always knew you'd end up here
at some point

but I didn't think it would be
this early.

Or this noisy.

-You live here?
-Sure do.

I usually don't wake up
till 8:00AM.

Noon on weekends.

Too bad marina bylaws only
restricts noise until 7:00.


You know this is a long shot,
right?

The competition is fierce
because of that prize money

and the displays nowadays,

some of them could even rival
some of your mom's best work.

I'm gonna pretend like
you didn't say that.

I know, I'm just trying
to manage expectations.

You only have a week
until Christmas Eve.

And this, this is a lot of work
for anyone and a kid.

Hey!

I mean, a highly intelligent,
extremely capable,

super awesome kid.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

What is the worst
that could happen?

So, we lose the parade and
I'm right back where we started

and I'll just use the insurance
money like I planned.

All right. Good luck.

We're good.
We don't need luck.

You sure?

[struggling grunts]

Can you help me, please?


<i>Liz: You're a fantastic helper.</i>

Oh!


What's going on now?

I want to show you something.

You do these last night?

Yeah.

I couldn't sleep.

Um, what do you think?

It's very impressive.

You're gonna need to build
framing for all of this.

And you'll definitely need
reinforcement for that,

besides the sheer number
of lights.

It's cool.

I just don't think the two of
you will be able to pull it off.

I agree.

The two of us can't.

No, no.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Find someone else.

Come on.

Do you remember how much fun we
used to have doing the parade?

I'm too busy.

I've got work and this
is the busiest time of year

for Mom at the shop,
I just can't.

Luke, it'll be just like
when we were kids.

When we were kids
we weren't responsible

for an entire parade float.

Fine, if you won't do it for me,
then do it for my dad.

I don't even really like
your dad that much.

And if you won't do it for him,
then do it for her.

Pretty please, Mr. Luke.

Won't you make a little girl's
Christmas wish come true?

Oh, wow, that is low.
That's really low.

Should we just wait for you
out here?

â™ª

Here's the plan.

Once we're finished
cleaning out

the rest of this junk
off the deck,

you can start framing the
presents at the bottom
of the mast

and Hannah and I will run
support lines in the rigging.

Once that's done, you can start
framing Santa's sleigh

and we'll do the wire frames
for the reindeer.

First of all, this is a parade
of lights,

not a carpentry contest.

There's no sense framing boxes

if we don't have lights
to hang on them.

And second of all, nope.

Where are you going?

Unlike when we were kids,
I've got a job.

You'll come around,
Luke Fletcher.

It's only a matter of time

before you get on board
with my plan.

You know I hate nautical puns.

You "shore" about that?

Argh!

Ok, ok, ok, but you see
the possibility, right?

All I see is an old boat
that needs a lot of work.


Men.

You stick that there and...

Mmmmm...

Did you have a fun day?

I got stuck in a net.
That was kind of cool.

Wait a minute, is,
is that dinner?

Yes.

Ok. That does it.
I'm cooking tomorrow.

I'm making my world-famous
spaghetti and meatballs.

Seriously?

This is not how families
eat dinner.

Ok.

If you say so.

Hey, that's my roof!

Mm.

Uh-uh.


Yeah, I'll send Marcus
over to check it out

once we're done with
the Keller house.

Ok.

Bye.

Dang.

You've been holding out on me.

My sources tell me you've got
a new job offer.

How does Julie know everything
that happens in this town?

A little scary.

It's terrifying.

How come you're at work with me
when you should be down

at the docks with the girl
who got away?

I mean, I know I'm pretty
and all, but...

She didn't get away, Marcus.

Liz and I were best friends
and we just drifted apart.

Which never made sense.

You guys were joined at the hip,
going to college together.

Sure, but I had to leave
after that first semester.

For good reason.

But her family's here,
she visits.

Right. All the time,
with her boyfriend,

who later became her husband.

That's gotta hurt.

Here's your nuts.

Merry Christmas.

So that's it, huh?
Just missed your chance.

What do you want me to say,
Marcus?

It wasn't meant to be.

Well, I hope the next time
opportunity comes knocking

you'll be ready
to answer that door.

You're being extra
weird today.

Knock, knock.

-Oh, hey!
-Hi.

Wow. Santa and her reindeer
are moving really fast today.

Yeah, well six days
until Christmas.

The lights are ordered
and on their way,

but we still have a lot
of work to do, so.

-Hi, Marcus.
-Liz.

I don't want to interrupt
your really busy day,

but we're gonna go clean out
the boat.

Uh, it sounds like you could
use a hand.

Listen Luke, the guys and I
can take care of things,

why don't you take the rest
of the day off?

-I can't.
-I think you can.

-Nah, I can't.
-Oh, I insist.

You realize I'm your boss,
right?

-Feels more like partners.
-Mmm.

Besides, 'tis the season
of giving, remember?

Good to see you, Liz.
Good luck in the parade.

Ok.


They sure know how to make a big
deal out of nothing, don't they?

That's because they've never
seen a real-life hero before.

Hey, I'm still mad at you
for telling Liz I needed help.

I know.

It was quite terrible of me.

You having the usual?

No, not today,
I'm making dinner.

You're making dinner?

Yeah.

And I need something
for dessert.

I just sold my
last Christmas cake,

but, I'll tell you what.

I will whip up a fresh one

and drop it off on my way
home after work.

That's very kind.

You'll stay for dinner then?

That would be lovely.

Good.

â™ª

All sorts of stuff in here,
books and clothes.

Perfume.

Oh, look at this.

Christmas, 1991.

It's like he stored her entire
life down here.

Oh, wow.
Hey, look at this.

She wanted to capture
every family moment.

I remember, this was
the year

Dennis let me drive the boat
by myself.

You ok?

Yeah. I just wish she was here.
She was so good at this.

Well, that just means
you learned from the best.

She had this way of making
people feel something

when the boat lit up.

Nostalgia, joy, excitement.

A design like that takes weeks
to come up with.

Not one night.

-Can I tell you something?
-What?

I think you're being too hard
on yourself.

Look what I found!

Oh!

That was Grandma's camera!

-Can I see?
-Yeah.

-Oh, you know what,
-Come on in here.

I think there's still
some film in here.

Here we go.

What are you doing?

You know what I'm doing.
Here we go.

Yes.

Smile.

Smile!

There it is.

Ok. Big smile.

Show those teeth.

<i> Big... Yay!</i>

One more. Silly face.
Goofy face.

That's the one.
That's the one.

Ok. My turn.

[Liz laughing]

Ready? This is the original
selfie.

Ready?

Got it. Perfect.

And you know what?

I think that's the end
of the roll.

Hey, do you...

do you maybe want to come
to dinner tonight?

Dinner?

Dad's cooking and it's
the least we could do

to thank you for your
free labor.

Hm. It sounds like a good idea,
but hang on,

I'm not being paid?


Oh, what? Oh really?

That was a bullseye!

Here, trade me.

Thanks.

You know, you really didn't
have to.

I know, I did.

Dennis would never forgive me
for showing up empty-handed.

-Wow!
-Oh?

Mom!

Awesome!

You hung your wreath
on the door!

Of course.

I want all my neighbors to see
what a special little girl

my granddaughter is.


<i> Dennis: Well, I'll be.</i>

<i> Dennis: Now it feels like</i>
<i> Christmas.</i>

â™ª

You two ran wild on those docks.

A real pair of pirates
you were.

Arr!

I had to apologize to every boat
owner in town

by the time you were
12 years old.

That is not true.
We were not that bad.

Stop giving my daughter ideas.

I was a perfect angel. I never
got into any trouble.

I remember one Christmas
in particular

when your mother was mad

because I wouldn't let her
stay up to meet Santa.

So she came up with a brilliant
idea to stow away on my-

Do you know what that is,
to stow away?

Hide out on Martin
Therwood's boat,

right before he and his wife

left on a two-month trip
to Canada.

I remember that year.

Operation escape
to the North Pole.


And as usual, she wrangled
this one in.

Oh, which was a terrible idea

because I would be Santa's
right-hand elf right now

if he hadn't blown our cover.

I told her I was scared
of polar bears.

I warned you.
You knew.

Your mother had to warn every
boat owner in town

to double check their cargo
before they left.

Good idea.
That was smart.

And don't you even think
about it.


No, do not. It's not worth it.
It's lovely here.

You are not getting out of my
sight until you're in college.

I had big dreams.
Big travel plans.

I wanted to go places.

-And drag me along with you.
-Always, always drag you along.

Mmm.


Oh.

So, I have a very,
very important question.

Uh-oh.

-Ah, move the forks!
-Got it.

-Why do you live on a boat?
-Oh, here we go.

Why does everyone have
a problem with the boat?

I don't have a problem with it,
I don't. I just...

I find it odd that someone
who builds houses

would then choose
not to live in one.


Uh, no one has ever put it
to me that way before.

You're welcome.

But, so far, doesn't seem to be
affecting business.

Ok, ok. Fair enough.

I don't know, to be honest.

I always felt more comfortable
on the water.

And Dad was the same way.

I guess his career choice made
a little more sense than mine.

He was a great man.

I'm sorry that I wasn't around
more after he died.

Don't be.

I'm the one who decided
not to go back to college

after the funeral.

I always felt like you,
you were a little mad at me,

because I went back and,
and you stayed here.

What?

What are you talking about?
Why would I be mad?

You had to go back.

Yeah, I know, but whenever
I would come home after that

it always just felt like
you were avoiding me

and it's the only reason
that I could think of.

What? No, that's not...

No, it wasn't...

Things were just different.

I had to work and to take care
of Mom.

And you... had Kevin.

<i> Hannah: Mom, come look!</i>

Do you think we can use this
on the boat?

<i> [laughing]</i>
<i> Liz: Absolutely.</i>

I think it would look great
back by the wheel.

And there's still lots more
to go through.

Well, I hope you take a break
from the competition

to go to winter ball this year.

Hold up, winter ball? You mean
like in a fairy tale?

We didn't bring any
of my dresses!

This little town likes
big names.

It's not that fancy.

Excuse me?

There's dancing, there's food,
a real live band.

If that doesn't sound like a
ball then I don't know what is.

I've never been to
a ball before.

Well, we'll just have to find
a gallant prince

to take you and your mom.

I wonder where we'll find
one of those.

Luke, will you take us
to the ball?

Oh, that's really not my scene.

Oh.

Seriously, you're
still boycotting it?

I convinced him to go
once in high school,

and apparently
he's never been back.

Well, I am no gallant prince,
do, do, do.

[English accent]
I'm just a guy
with two left feet.



Look at this guy!

Didn't we make these with Mom
in third grade?

I still have mine.


Wow. It's so beautiful.

This was Grandma's favorite.

She let me put it on top
of the tree every year.


What else do we have in here?
What is this?

Dad? You ok?

I'm fine.

Your mom and I always planned on
taking a trip when we retired.

There's a cluster
of small islands

off the coast of South America.

The Galapagos trip.
You guys talked about it a lot.

I never meant to lie to you
about the boat.

I wanted to get rid of it.
It hurt to look at the thing.

It's just that every time
someone made an offer

all I could think about was
about how we were never
gonna take that trip.

Why didn't you ask me
to come home

and help you with the house?

I didn't think you ever wanted
to come back here.

Well, part of me didn't.
Can you blame me?

You don't understand.

That first year when I lost
your mom was...

You know what,
I do understand.

But you decided how we were
supposed to grieve for her

and I didn't get a say in that.

But you're still my Dad,
and this is still my home.

I didn't realize how bad things
had gotten until recently,

with the bank.

Mary always took care
of that kind of stuff.

I guess it's fair to say
that now,

when I lost her I let
a few things slip.

Better go say goodbye
to our guests.

Dad?

I miss her too.

Every day.

â™ª

Oh, come on! Just...

Urgh!!!

Why won't you just... turn!


Ahhhh!!!!!

Are you ok?

-Hi.
-Hi.

Good morning.

Are you having a little trouble?

Nope.

You know, we don't need
the main sail for the parade.

We can just troll along
on the engine.

I'm aware, but we need something
that will really impress

the judges and this thing
is broken!

Do you mind if I...
May I?

Please.

Yeah, sometimes they can get
a little...

You just gotta...

Well, here you go.

You just have to...

What did you do?

Magic touch.

Well, your magic touch
might have just saved us.

Oh, Liz?

We're gonna blow those judges
right out of the water.

Uh, Liz? You might want
to check this out.

Ah.

And here is your
choc-hocolate.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

Ahoy, neighbor.

-Here.
-Thank you.

Hey, I think it was
a really good idea

and this design is still
great without it.

It's too simple.

It's got no heart,
no pizzazz, no...

Hey, the Liz I grew up with

would never do anything
without heart.

And if that's who
I'm working with,

then I'm going to do everything
in my power

to make sure this is the best
boat in the parade.

Pizzazz included.

You actually came around,
didn't you?

It was bound to happen.
Schooner or later.


Don't tell anyone
I just did that.

-Shhh!
You made your first pun.

Alright, alright.

Finish your cocoa,
we've got work to do.

We've got a parade to win!

Let's do this.

Alright.

<i> â™ª Deck the halls</i>
<i> with boughs of holly â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª Fa la la la</i>

<i> [laughing]</i>

<i>Joyce: Oh, are you going to want</i>
<i> another one?</i>

<i> Luke: I'll have another one.</i>

Yes! Thank you. I appreciate
you so much.

I'll pick it up first thing
in the morning.

Thanks buddy.

Everything ok?

Yes. Yeah.

It was just a work thing.

She's really starting to look
good, huh?

You think so?

Yeah, just my opinion though.
You're the expert.

Dennis told me about some of
the clients you work with.

Very impressive.

Do you two actually
play any chess

or do you just gossip
about me?

Ah, a little bit of both.

But you like it,
your job?

I love it.

Even though it's not
your typical dream job, but...

-Who wants typical dreams?
-Mmm.

I'm really glad your life worked
out the way you wanted it to.

Is that what it looks like?
Because my life is complicated.

Emotionally, financially,
all the "ly's" you can think of.

Romantically?

Well, that's not
that complicated.

I just haven't really
wanted to date

since Kevin and I
got divorced.

Well, good thing you
don't live here.

The local matchmakers
would never stand by.

Yet here you are, a bastion
of bachelorhood.

The local ladies don't like
the boat life or...

What?

There are plenty of ladies that
can't wait to be my first mate.

Huh! Plenty, huh?

Sure, I've had options.

And?

And what?

The right one just hasn't
come along yet.

We should get back to work.

Actually, I think we should
take a break.

Why?

I think our youngest sailor
needs one.


I think I'm seasick.

The boat isn't even moving.

It must be scurvy then.

That sounds serious.


Good thing I know just the cure.

One hot chocolate
with extra whipped cream

should clear that scurvy
right up.


Mmm.

Mom?

No way!

Hannah, what are you doing?

Elves, Mom! Santa's elves
were right here!

What?

Where do you think they went?

I think I might have an idea.
Come on.

Come on, Mom!

We haven't missed it.
Come on, get in there.

-Ok.
-Come on, Mom.

Welcome, boys and girls and a
very merry Christmas to you all.

All: Merry Christmas!

Hey, why aren't you
in the North Pole?

Because, my friend, the big
man himself needs your help.

I don't remember this.

It's new.
it started last year.

Shh!

<i> Elf: We need you to help</i>
<i> make sure</i>

<i> everyone has an</i>
<i> amazing Christmas.</i>

Do you think you can help?

All: Yes!

Come on, Santa needs us!

You're right. Santa needs us.
Let's go!

I'll be right here.


Hey.

Oh, hey, Dad. What
are you doing down here?

I was just coming back from
lunch with Joyce,

I thought I'd check and see

if Luke's mom was getting on
all right.

Oh.

-He worries, you know.
-Oh, he always has.

Grandpa! Guess what?

I'm an honorary elf. I'm gonna
help save Christmas.

Really?

Santa's list of non-perishable
donations.

This sounds like a very
important job.

It is, Luke's one too.

-Nice hat.
-Thank you.

Aren't you a little old
to be an elf?

It's never too late
for a career change.

Well, I hope you haven't
completely given up construction

because we have a lot of work
to do today.

But Mom, Santa needs help
saving Christmas!

Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

We have so much to finish
before the parade.

Hannah, why don't you come with
me and you guys go do your work?

Really?

If your mom says it's ok.

Of course it's ok.

All right, Hannah.

Hannah, I'm going to have
to go into early retirement.

Yeah.

Dennis, you are now one
of Santa's little helpers.

You're gonna need this.

And this.

Good luck to you.

-Come on, kid.
-Bye!

You call me if you
need anything.

He's never wearing that hat.

It'll look great on him.
Yeah.


Just the two of us.

Yes. And a boat.

-The boat.
-Yeah.

-The boat. Shall we?
-We shall.

Some choice.

That's really what I said?

That I would never speak
to you again?

Word for word.

I don't know. That doesn't sound
like me.

Maybe you're remembering
it wrong.

Nope.

I've got the whole thing
stored up here.

The entire Liz Darling
encyclopedia.

Oh really?

Try me.

Favorite band in high school?

Pearl Jam.

Favorite food?

Coconut snowballs.

Favorite teacher?

Mr. Kirby. The drama teacher.

High school crush?

Mr. Kirby. The drama teacher.

-No!
-Yes!

that. Not even you.

Favorite color? Purple.

Greatest fear? Needles.

Favorite book?
The Secret Window.

Face it, I know everything
about you.

I bet you didn't know that I had
another high school crush.

Oh no, poor Mr. Kirby.
Who was it?

You.

-No you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

-No, you didn't.
-Fine. I didn't.

Good.

Look out!

Woah.

Woah.

Oh. Uh, thank you.

Yeah, no problem.


Hey, uh, listen.

There's no way you had a crush
on me in high school.

Because I, uh...

[phone ringing]

-Because if I'm honest, I...
-I have to get this.

Hello?

We make a good team, Grandpa.

We sure do.

Excuse me, but we need to make
sure this gets delivered

to Mr. Claus as soon
as possible.

Most people only pick one
of two items on the list.

Yeah, well, my granddaughter
is very serious

about Christmas spirit.

No kidding.

Well, I can tell you one thing,

if you two weren't on Santa's
nice list before,

you certainly are now.

Did you hear that, Grandpa?
You're on the nice list too!

Yeah, well that'll be
a nice change for me.

What's going on, kid?

How come you stopped wanting
to spend Christmas with us?

I like spending it with you.

I like spending it with you too.

Ah. It's just, Christmas is a
hard time of the year for me.

Mom said it's because
you miss Grandma a lot.

Mm. That's true.

But I don't understand.

If you miss Grandma,
and Mom misses Grandma,

wouldn't it just be better
if we all missed her together?

Oh, god.

You're just like your Grandma,
you know that?

-Really?
-Yeah.

Kind, funny, clever as a whip.

She would love to be spending
time with you,

just like I am right now.


Ok, let's go. Let's go see what
your mom's up to.

Ok.

-Ok, here, come here.
-Woo!

Oh, yeah.

Onward!

Ok.

Wee!

I mean, you said it yourself.
It was a long shot.

I was wrong. All we have
to do is...

We did it!
We saved Christmas!

You did?! That was quick.

No time to waste when
your stakes are high.

Now I can help decorate again.

Good. 'Cause we need
all the help we can get.

Thanks, Dad.

Oh, I had fun.
She's such a great kid.

She really is.

What's wrong?

I heard from the insurance
company.

My claim's not gonna
come through in time.

I'm sorry, Dad, we have
no backup plan.

And there's so much to do
before the parade.

Well, if you need all the help
you can get,

maybe I can lend a hand.

I still have one good one.

-It's ok.
-Thank's Dad.

Well, that's it.

Every lightbulb we've got
is on there.

I just hope it's enough.

So, what do we do now?

I've got an idea.

Woah!


Oh yeah.

Oh, I love the smell of a fresh
Christmas tree, don't you?

Thank you guys
for the extra muscle.

Boom.

And, if we don't see you,
have a merry Christmas.

Oh, but I'll see you tonight,
at the ball, right?

I don't think so.

Oh, but you gotta go.

Come on, Julie and I love it.

Dancing, music, food,
the whole deal.

It's a great place for a date.

Ok, it's time to go.

You're giving me a lift back
to my truck.

Bye!

One of the matchmakers you were
talking about?

I'm sorry about him.

It's ok.

Well...

I'll see you tomorrow.

Yeah.

-Have a good night.
-You too.

-Hi.
-Hi.

So, I was thinking.

We should all go to the ball.

I thought it wasn't your scene?

That's true,
it's not my scene

but I think Hannah
would love it.

Oh.

Ok. Yeah, um, I'll ask her
and, um, we will think about it.

-Ok?
-Ok.

Ok.

So I'll go.

I'll go now, and then maybe
I'll see you later.

Maybe.

Hey, Hannah?

It's perfect.

Good, good.

Actually, better than perfect.

Mom says that Grandma
is watching over us

because she's an angel.

Just like this one.

Do you want to put it
on the tree?

No.

I would like to put it
on together.

Come on.

-Ok. Ready?
-Yeah.

Okay, here we go. Up.
And up.

-Nice
-Oh yeah.

So beautiful.

â™ª

All right.

Finally.

Honest opinions.

Hair up, hair down?

-Up!
-Down!

-Up!
-Down!


You guys are no help.

Why does it matter?
It's just a dance.

<i>Dennis: Oh, you will understand</i>
<i> one day.</i>

<i>Come on, we'll be in the truck.</i>
<i> Come on, kiddo.</i>

It's just a dance.
It's not a date.

It's just a dance.

Hair down.

â™ª

Luke, this is so cool!

I knew you would like it.

Wow, you look um...

Healthy?

I'm going to find Ms. Benson.

-Ok.
-Ok.

-You look great.
-Thanks.

Ok.

See ya, Dennis.

-Do you want to get a drink?
-Yeah.

So, is it as dreadful as
you thought it would be?

Uh, not quite. But the night
is still young.

It always made me so nervous.

Wondering if someone was going
to ask me to dance or not.

I don't recall you having
an issue with that.

Oh, come on.

Guys were climbing
over each other

just to get a chance
to dance with you.

They were not.

You never asked me.

I didn't know you ever
wanted me to ask.

I wouldn't have said no.

<i> [slow song plays]</i>
<i> â™ª</i>

[clears throat]

Elizabeth Darling,
may I have this dance?

You may.

What was it Joyce called me...
a gallant prince.

â™ª

Oh, oh.

How can I expect anything
so fancy.

Mm. Fancy's overrated.

â™ª

Do you know why I never came
back to this thing

after senior year?

Hm?

I had built up this moment
so much.

I was going to ask you to dance,

I was going to hold you close

and then lean in,
whisper in your ear

and tell you exactly
how I felt about you.

You never asked me to dance.

I chickened out.

I missed my opportunity.

Just out of curiosity, what were
you gonna whisper in my ear?

â™ª

Liz Darling, I'm in love with
you and I always have been.

â™ª

â™ª

I wish I could go back in time
and tell you sooner.

What do you think
would have happened?

It looks like we'll have
a chance to find out.

When we first got here,

Hannah said that it was going to
be just like when I was a kid.

It's not that easy though.
We're leaving in a few days.

-Then stay.
-Luke.

I'm serious. You and Hannah
could stay here.

We have a life back in Seattle.

Hannah's school, my work.
Our friends.

It's a good life.

Sure. But look at where we are.

All these years later, to end up
back in the same moment.

There's gotta be a reason
for it, right?

Would you do it?

Would you uproot your life
and leave Portside?

I... I can't.

I just can't leave Mom,
you know?

And I've got a company and
so many people here rely on me.

Our timing really is terrible,
isn't it?

I guess it's just not meant
to be, huh?

I can't really regret

the way that things turned out
between us.

Not really.

Because I wouldn't
have Hannah.

And you know what?

I wouldn't change a thing.

Good night, Luke.

-Hey Dad.
-Yeah.

I'm gonna head home early.
Can you stay with Hannah?

-Ok.
-Ok.

Is she all right?

Picked a good tree.

Yeah. Yeah. Oh.

Really brightens up the place.

Dad, what are you gonna do
if we lose the parade?

Well, I've given it some thought
and I think that win or lose,

we sell the boat.

What? No.

Wait, hold on, I'm not telling.

I'm asking, I want to know
how you feel about it.

But, I'm not getting
any younger.

I'm not sailing
the high seas anymore.

And that beautiful
lady's being wasted,

just stuck at the marina
all year.

Nobody keeping her company.

But Mom loved that boat.

No, no kiddo.

No, it was never about the boat.

Or the decorations
for the parade.

Your mom loved you and... me.

For her it was all about us
spending time together

as a family.

And being the old fool I am,

I convinced myself that we
couldn't do that without her.


But this past week, having you
here and getting to know that,

that amazing little girl,
that you're raising.

I'm just sorry.

I'm so sorry that we missed
all those Christmases.

I've missed you, Dad.

Oh, I missed you, kiddo.

Now, tell me what happened
between you and Luke tonight.

Not much to tell.

Just...

Just not meant to be,
I guess.

I'm gonna go tuck in Hannah.

-Good night, Dad.
-Good night, kiddo.

Hm.

Hello?

Who's there?

Oh, honey you scared me.

Sorry.

Why aren't you getting things
ready for the parade?

We finished yesterday.

So I thought I'd come help
out here.

Well, I appreciate your help,

but wouldn't you rather spend
time with Liz while she's here?

Uh...

Luke?

I told her how I feel.

I see. And?

We realized it's just
not gonna work.

I mean, she's got her whole life
in Seattle

and I've got my
responsibilities here.

That hasn't changed.

You remind me so much
of your father.

He was always making sacrifices
for other people.

Trying to take care
of the whole world.

Mom.

No, no, no, listen to me.

You stepped up when
this family was hurting.

And he would have been so proud
of the sacrifices you've made,

but I should have told you this
a long time ago.

I don't need you to take care
of me anymore.

What I need is for you
to take care of yourself.

So you have to decide
what you want.

And what you're willing
to do for it.

I don't want you to spend
another second

with less love in your life
on my account.

And I can do all of this
on my own.

Yeah, you can.

Thank you very much.

Dennis, I was hoping
I'd find you here.

A-ha! Come to try
your luck again.

No, well, actually, yes.

Uh, is Liz around?

No, she and Hannah
went into town

to get provisions
for tonight.

Good. Good.
That's good.

You all right, son?

Dennis, I'm in love
with your daughter.

Of course you are.

Oh.

Uh, it's not the reaction
I was expecting.

What I'm wondering,
what I have always wondered

is when are you going to do
something about it?

Well, actually that's...
that's why I'm here.

I've got a plan, but I'm gonna
need your help.

What can I do?

Everyone's really excited, Mom.

Aren't you?

Yeah, but do you think
we can still win?

Oh, I don't know about that,

but I don't want you to think
about it, ok?

Just have fun sailing in
the parade like I used to

with my mom, ok?

-Ok.
-Ok.

Hey, Joyce sent along
some treats for the voyage.

But we gotta get going
they're gonna start soon.

Ok.

What about Luke?

Um, I don't know if he's gonna
make it, Banana.

But he worked so hard on it.

I know.

<i> â™ª</i>

-Hi.
-Joyce.

-Oh, so good to see you.
-I know.

-I am so excited!
-I'm excited!

Ahhh!!! Hi!

Come, come, come,
come, come.

Come here.

-Oh, look at that!
-That's nice.

<i> I really like that one.</i>

<i>Carol: I've never seen so many</i>
<i> of them.</i>

Oh, yeah!

That's a nice one.

<i> Joyce: Where are they?</i>
<i> Aren't they next?</i>

Ok. I think that's us.
Are you ready? Ok.

Ok, light her up, kiddo.

â™ª

Wow.

[cheering and applause]

Wow.

Amazing!

Amazing.

â™ª

Dad, what are you doing?

What I'm told.

But we don't need it,
there's a big hole in the...

â™ª

â™ª


I think I remember that.

â™ª

â™ª

Did you do this?

Hey.

Look, I know
this isn't simple

and I don't have
all the answers.

Luke.

No, but I am sick of wishing
that the timing would be right.

Or waiting for fate to do
all the work.

Luke.

I know, this could be
complicated and difficult

and messy but I know
what I want out of life.

And it's worth fighting for.

-Luke.
-Yeah?

Stop talking.

â™ª

They're kissing.

[crowd applauds]

-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

All: Merry Christmas!

-I still can't believe we won!
-I knew it.


Wow! Thanks, Grandpa.

This is the best Christmas ever.

That's a nice chess set,
maybe you can teach me to play.

-I doubt it.
-Thank you.

Hey. I think you've done
a great job.

Not too bad yourself.

-Thank you.
-Mm.

You know, I've been
thinking about

taking this home rebuild gig
up near Seattle.

Interesting, 'cause we plan
on visiting Dad a lot more.

Oh.

Yeah, our paths may cross.

-Maybe.
-Mmm.

Maybe this is the beginning of
our very own fairy tale ending?


It's terrible.

I've created a monster.

Ok, that's it.

This is the last Christmas
with my darling Mary.

It's family picture time.

Come on, let's get up.

Down here at the end, Dad?

Yeah, right here.

-You got those
slippery shoes on.
-I know.

You all right?

-Okay, here we go.
-Okay.

Hey, tall kids in the back.
What are you doing?

Excuse me sir, will you take
our picture?

-Do you mind?
-Thank you.

Joyce!

-He said family picture.
-Family picture!

Come on, bring it in Joyce.

All right. You ready?
Get in nice and close.

Ok, alright. Everybody say
Merry Christmas!

All: Merry Christmas!
