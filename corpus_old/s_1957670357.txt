so for your safety
and the protection of those around you,

do not attempt

Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
Welcome to Jackass.

[Zach moans] No!

-Come on. Just come on.
-[Jeff] Shit.

-[Johnny] There we go! There we go!
-[Zach screaming]

-[Wee Man] A double whammy!
-[Jeff] Oh shit!

-Get it off!
-[Wee Man] He got a double whammy!

-Oh! Get it off! Please get it off!
-[Johnny] I can't!

-Oh my God!
-I'm trying!

-He won't stop!Â He won't stop!
-Oh, please!

-I'm trying!
-Please!


Please! Oh my God!
Please let me outta here! Crap!

-C'mon!
-[theme music playing]

-[Zach] Oh my God! Fuck you, Jeff!
-[group laughing]

[Zach groans]

Hello. My name's Johnny Knoxville,
and I'm about to end this movie.

-[loud popping]
-[all gasp]

-[Johnny laughs]
-What?

-[Jeff] First of all, let me say this.
-[blasting]

like it's the last one.

We always take on that attitude.
"This is the last one."

We did that after the first movie.
We did it after the second movie.

We did it after the third movie.

And after the third movie,
I truly did believe that was the last one.

Oh my God! Look in the mirror.

-A grown man. Yes.
-[group cheers]

And, uh, I got a call
from Knoxville, and he's like, "Hey."

"I think, I'mâ€¦"

"I wanna do another Jackass movie."
I'm like, "Holy shit."

I don't know.
I just had a feeling, y'know?

I'd been writing it
for ten years, since the last one.

And I just got looking through
all the ideas one day,

and I thought,
"These would really be fun to shoot."

Then I got that feeling,
which I couldn't get rid of until we shot.

I was 100% sure that the ship had sailed

and that we would never make
Jackass again.

Then all of a sudden,
outta nowhere, after a decade,

Knoxville says, "I'm ready to go again."

Yeah, I know. Totally blindsided me.

But I was stoked. God.

-[man] How you doing?
-Good morning.

-[man] All right. Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

we wanted to bring in some new blood,

but I wanted to also make sure

we had the original cast
and get them represented.

They had to be on board with it too.

-Yeah, Wee Man. Good morning.
-[Wee Man] Yeah, man.

-Yeah, Johnny.
-[Johnny] What's goin' on?

as far as finding new cast,

we just reached out to friends.

This man right here, Trip Taylor,
is the reason we have this man, Poopies.

-Legend.
-Yeah.

Lookin' for some fresh blood,
and Trip's like, "You gotta meet Poopies."

[surf music playing]

[Steve-O] He's just so lovable and dumb.

Ow.

Which is a really good mix for Jackass.

Hey, I'm Jasper,
and I'm gonna jump off this ramp.


when we started shooting a show
called Loiter Squad together.

I knew he'd fit right in.

-[man] You a'ight, Jasper?
-Victory is mine!

I learned about Zach
from the World Wide Web.

You'd see these gnarly videos
of aâ€¦ larger fellow

doing really outrageous stunts.


-[firecrackers popping]
-[Zach groaning]

Yeah, Zach won everybody over.



And how'd you find Rachel?

I just liked her Instagram.
I thought she was funny.

My mom, she was the judge
that put O.J. Simpson in prison.

-[woman] What the--
-Yeah.

So basically, O.J. Simpson
got sent to prison

by the same woman who sent me to my room.

-[audience chuckles]
-But we got out.

[audience laughs]

-This is Eric Manaka.
-[Eric] Mm-hmm.

did you think when I cast you

for that film in South Africa

that you would be standing here today?

-Never in a million years.
-Covered in semen?

With semen in my mouth, currently.

-[chuckling]
-Mm-hmm.

-You've hit the big time, kid.
-[both laughing]

-Hi, Mum.
-Ooh. Sorry, Mom.

this great new cast together,

but I think we still all
had some questions.

And then, you know, there's,
like, there's trepidation just on,

y'know, how we're older now.

-Like, is it still funny?
-Yeah, I was skeptical. I wasâ€¦ I meanâ€¦

-You were the most skeptical.
-I was very skeptical--

We came to you. We were all psyched.
Then you were like, "Uhâ€¦"

It was like, "We have to prove it
to ourselves that it's a good idea."

So let's shoot
a couple days but not commit,

and let it tell us that it's a movie.

was a bit that Steve-O shot a while ago,

just to see if the new guys
could really, y'know, keep up.

[Wee Man laughs]

First of all,
thank you, guys, for being here.

-[group] Yeah.
-Bear with me.

This is the first intro
I've done in ten years, I think, soâ€¦

[all laughing]

-Wow.
-Holy shit.

-Oh, stop. Stop. Please stop.
-[group cheering]

All right.

This is Fire in the Hole.

[Ehren chuckles]

There's other hot sauces, but this is his.

Wee Man's Chronic Tacos.

-For the best in hot sauce enemas.
-[group chuckling]

[cracking up] The old taste of Mexico.

[all laughing]

let's assume the positions, fellas.

-[group chattering]
-[Johnny] Iâ€¦ Goddamn.

I don't know
where I'm gonna put it in at, Preston.

There might be
some, uh, scrounging around a little.

Okay, everybody insert.

Sorry, bro!

-Oh my God, kid.
-[all clamoring]

It's in his butthole.

-[Ehren] To the left! Too much air!
-[Preston] To the left! The fuckin' left!

Oh my God! No, you're too low!
Higher! Higher! Higher! Higher!


-[Ehren] You can put it in yourself.
-[Wee Man] Hot sauce is goin' in!

Are you ready?

[guys screaming and groaning]

-[Johnny] It's not goin' down!
-[Poopies] Hey!

-It's not goin' down!
-[group laughing]

-[Preston] I don't have any.
-Oh, Poopies' is going down.

-[men groaning]
-[Johnny] Oh no!

-[Chris] Slowly going in.
-[Wee Man] It burning?

-It's burning!
-[Johnny] It's not going!


-Oh, fucking fuck!
-It's all over my hands now. Ugh.

-[Jaws] Yours isn't goin' in either!
-Oh shit!

-[Poopies] Oh God!
-[Dave] Jesus!


-[Jeff] Here, try this pump.
-[Johnny] Okay, we got a pump.


-[Johnny] One second.
-[Jeff] We gotta let-- Go on, Spike.

-[Johnny] Okay, are you in, Jaws?
-[Jaws] I'm in.

-[gas escapes]
-[all groaning]

[group laughing]



[guys groaning]

-[group laughing]
-[Johnny] Guys, watch it. Whoo.

-[Wee Man laughs] Yeah.
-[Poopies] Oh God.

-Here's some relief, fellas. There you go.
-Yes. [sighs]

-[Johnny] What flavor you need?
-I want one.


-[Chris] He needs a poopsicle real quick.
-[Johnny] There, Preston.

-Who-- There you go, Poopies.
-Thank you, sir.

-[Ehren] Relieve your ass.
-[Johnny] Jaws, are you okay?

-It feels so much better.
-[Poopies] It does feel way better.

-[Preston] Great.
-Good. Doin' the trick.

-[Wee Man laughs]
-[Poopies] Oh, yeah.

You dare me to do this?

[group screams and groans]


-My God!
-[Poopies] Wanna see something? Watch.

-[Wee Man] Oh God!
-[group laughing]


-[Dave] It's gonna be a fucked-up movie.
-[Wee Man] Yeah.

In hindsight, it was like an initiation.

It was like, if you can get through this,
then you can, y'know?

If you don't storm off set going,
"Nothin' doing,"

then it shows that you're down. [chuckles]

I didn't know what to expect with Jackass.

'Cause it was this weird feeling
of, "I've known you guys my whole life."

But also, "Oh my God."

"I can't believe
I'm here with them in person."

We're gonna have a little competition
between Preston Lacy and Zach Holmes.

Who can do the biggest long jump?

All competitors follow our instructions
as the gospel truth.

We frown on poor sportsmanship,
gambling, and slang.

-[man 1] Okay.
-All right. Get in our positions!

-[crew member claps]
-[all laughing]

[man 2] Oh God.

[group chattering]

-Fuck, I'm prime time! I'm prime time!
-We are fucked.

[group continues laughing]

-[Wee Man] He's like, "I'm fucked."
-[man 3] Stretch it out, Zach. Stretch.

[Zach farts]

-[man 4] Right there. There's the--
-[man 5] You guys are in the sweet spot.

Man, I'm right in there.

-[man 5] Planned this out well.
-I'm makin' muscles.

-I just wasn't thinking, and whoop-de-do.
-[Ehren laughs]

[man 5] All right. Good luck.

-[Chris] Zachary, are you ready?
-I'm ready.

Okay.

-â™ª Let me see the Tootsee Rollâ€¦ â™ª
-[horn blares]

C'mon!

[man 6 laughing] Oh!

[guys groaning]

Fuckin' God!

[guys grunting]

â™ª Cotton candy, sweetie, go
Let me see the Tootsee Rollâ€¦ â™ª

Got kneed right inâ€¦ Oh God.

-[Johnny] How much do you weigh?
-[Zach laughs] Like, fuckin' 400 pounds.

-[Johnny laughs] Oh shit!
-[Zach] Approximately.

-â™ª Cotton candy, sweetie, goâ€¦ â™ª
-[horn blares]

-[Wee Man screams]
-[Ehren] Oh no. Oh no.

[group groans]

[Wee Man] Fuck you, P!

-[grunts] Fuckin' dying.
-[group laughing]

-Dude, I think he's cryin'.
-[Johnny] You went and hit me so hard.

-[Wee Man groans]
-[Johnny] Oh my God.

[Wee Man] Oh. Now, that was
a straight knee to the nuts. [groans]


Judging this contest
is next to impossible.

There's only one way to really find out
which athlete's day will be today,

and that's if they run simultaneously.

[horn blares]

[guys scream]

[all groan]

-[Ehren] Goddamn it!
-[all laughing and grunting]

[Zach grunts]

That hurt quite a lot.


[Zach chuckling] That was fun.


-[Rachel] It was magnificent.
-[Preston] No.

have, uh, assessed the results,

and it's obvious
the clear winner today is diabetes, butâ€¦

-[group laughing]
-[Wee Man] Wow.

I think by halfway through the first day,
we were like, "Oh, this just feels great."

-[laughing] He just--
-[Spike] Oh my God. That's amazing.

I mean, it just felt good immediately.

Everyone was psyched.

-Everyone was in a good mood.
-[all cheer]

We were getting great stuff.

A lot of those bits
from the test wound up in the movie.

-[Ehren yells]
-[all laughing hysterically]

[Jasper laughs nervously]

-Mom, I'm sorry.
-[Johnny] You don't wanna play, Jasper?



Oh my gosh.
This is where I was like, "Okay."

"Things are gettin'
a little too gnarly right now."

"Things are goin' too far."

But I had to do it.

First time I've ever shown my dick
on camera.

I've for sure never seen
a dick that flat in my life.

It was like science class.

You just learn something new.
What the dick can do.

My name's Johnny Knoxville,
and this is Dong-Pong.

-Gentlemen. There you go.
-Thank you.

-[Chris] Holy shit.
-[Jasper grunts]

-[Rachel] Ah.
-Hey, try and get the ball.

-[groaning] Ow! Go get that!
-[Rachel] Get it, get it.

-[Dave sighs]
-[man 1] Dude.

-[man 2] Oh my God.
-[Johnny] Fifteen,Â love.

[group laughing]

-We just gotta take a breath.
-[both take a deep breath]

Get in sync.

Ping-pong, rally on.

M'kay.

-[group exclaims]
-Yeah!

-Oh!
-[group cheers]

-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-Victors!

Let's try this.
This is like a mini tug-of-war.Â See howâ€¦

-Back up.
-Oh.

-Ow.
-[Chris] Oh, dear.

-Ow! Oh my God! Ow!
-[Poopies screams]

[all groaning]

-[Poopies groaning] Ow! Oh my God! Ow!
-[group laughing]



meeting everyone and then seeing
all of their dicks and their buttholes.

And then it felt like family after that.

-That's a wrap on this test.
-Sorry, sorry.

Amazing job, everyone.

Thank you, everybody.

[all cheering and applauding]


me, Spike, and Knoxville all said,
"It's a go."

"And it's definitelyâ€¦ It feels right."

[cast chattering]

the movie on March 3, 2020.

Here they come.

Yeah, legend.

-[man] What up?
-What's up? How are you?

-[man] Good, and yourself?
-Good, man. I'm ready.

Got the boys here.
We got the crew. First stunt of the year.

Um, first stunt of the movie, actually.

-Yeah, Cordell.
-'Sup, buddy?

-How're you?
-Great to see you.

Good to see you.
So, yeah, we're on. Good to see you.

Are you excited to get things picked up?

Dude, I'm so excited.

I've been waitin'
pretty much my whole life for this, soâ€¦

I mean, we'reâ€¦
I'm workin' with legends right here.

I mean, it's crazy.

I'm excited.

[indistinct chatter]


-Who?
-[Johnny] Can you--? I'm Tesla.

Tesla's under-admired.

And this is going to do
nothing to help that. [chuckles]


This is our friend James,
an esteemed scientist.

-You're a scientist?
-Yes.

What is that?


-They can put out up to 600 volts.
-[Johnny gasps]

So, the idea
for the electric eel was that,

"Can electricity come
from this animal, go through somebody,

and into a metal key
and then into somebody else?"


That was funny.

Oh, man. Wee Man tryin' to do intros?

He could not get those intros right,
and it was so satisfying.

Hi. I'm Benjamin Franklin,
father of electricity,

and this is an electric eel.

Countrymen, nativesâ€¦

-[laughs]
-Wait, no.

-Romans.
-Friends.

-Friends.
-Romans.

-Romans and countrymen.
-Countrymen.

Friends, Romans, and countrymen,

show me your rears.

[group cracks up]

[Rachel, laughing] Lend me your ears.

-[Steve-O] Show him your rear!
-[man 1] Lend me your ears.

and countrymen, lend me your ears.

[group laughing]

-[Johnny] Okay. Oh, yeah.
-[Wee Man] Ready? Yes.

Friends, Romans, and Ehren,
lend me your rear.

-[electricity crackles]
-Oh gosh! [scoffs]

It did.

-[Steve-O] Jesus!
-[Wee Man] Are you ready?

[Steve-O laughs]

-[electricity crackles]
-[Ehren groans]

-[electricity crackles]
-[yelps]

Get the key in.

-[electricity crackles]
-[Ehren screams]

[group laughing]

[man 2] Did it work?

-Yeah, it worked. We got electricity, man.
-What? Fuckin' key, man.

What do you think the lights are on for?

-[key clangs]
-[laughs]

We learned that electric eels
do conduct enough electricity

to go through Wee Man,
into a key, into a butthole.

It's like, we learned important things.
Science things.

-[Jeff] Yeah. Who knew?
-[Spike] Who knew?


And I remember

going home that night,
and it was my birthday.

And I got a call from Spike,

and I'm like, "Oh,Â Spike's callin'
to wish me happy birthday."

-[laughs]
-And he's like, "Hey man."

we're going to shut down."

I'm like, "What do you mean?"
He goes, "COVID."

And I was-- I just couldn't wrap my head
around us shutting down.

We didn't know
if it was gonna be for two weeks,

if it was gonna be for a month.

-[nurse] Exposure to someone positive?
-[Dave] No.

You're gonna get swabbed twice.

So if you need to blow your nose,
go ahead and do so now.


today is our first day
filming againÂ in seven months.

-Notice anything different?
-[Jeff] A funny thing happened.

When we came back,
Johnny Knoxville had gray hair.

-[Johnny] Thank you. We're good?
-[man] You're okay.


I'm all safe to shoot
a very dangerous film. [chuckles]

And then, we're one of the first movies
in Los Angeles that's back up and running.


Like, it was tricky.

And we had to get tested every day.

There was just
a whole new set of safety protocols.

-[Steve-O coughs]
-[man] Steve-O just coughed.

-[group laughs]
-[Chris] I'll get Ebola.

So, let's use that to our advantage.
Like, let'sâ€¦

Let's throw a COVID safety meeting.

This is Don,
our "COVID safety officer" for today.

He will be running the guys through
some safety precautions while on set.

And, uh, man, I just hope it goes well.

[Johnny and Don laugh]



I'm a COVID-19 compliance officer.

I'm here to help implement
the standards by the CDC

to help you get-- keep you guys safe.

So, we wanna keep the crew--

[air whooshing loudly]


[cast laughing and grunting]



[cast continues laughing]

the world was ending for a second.

[group laughing loudly]


Aren't we supposed
to take this shit seriously?

That was a real good way
to get back intoâ€¦Â [chuckling]

And at that moment,
I truly realized, like,

we're fucked.


Uh, we, as, uh, the cast,
are basically gonna just be

tortured for the next year.

-Whatever.
-[man] Oh my God.

That was the first thing
we shot back from COVID.

So already, the guys were on their toes.

And plus, with the new protocols,

they knew we weren't gonna be able
to shoot as much man on the street,

so we were gonna take that out
on the cast. [chuckles]

Hi. What's up, everybody?
My name's Poopies.

I'm the newest member
of the Jackass 4 crew.

about your life once this comes out?

Well, I think that, umâ€¦

Well, one thing that I think
is gonna change in my life is, uh,

the fame.

But I don't let that get to me, dude.

I just wanna be by the beach,
surfin' and chasin' chicks my whole life.

So, I mean,
that's gonna be definitely a plus,

but I just wanna make
moreâ€¦ more projects and film more--

-[Poopies groans]
-[Johnny laughing]

Oh my gosh, dude. [chuckles]

-Oh, bro!
-[Johnny] Are you okay?

-Are you okay?
-Oh my gosh! That was a good slap, dude.

Knoxville, good morning.

I'm always on edge
when I'm on set because,

y'know, anything can be a prank.

[air whooshing loudly]


-What the fuck?
-[Johnny] Oh my God!


-I fuckin' knew it!
-[Johnny] Oh my God!

Like, this could be a prank right now.
I don't fuckin' know.

-[laughs] You know?
-[blasting]

And every-- Nothing is real.

-[man] Let's lay it down.
-[laughing] What the fuck?

[all laughing]

[sighs, laughs nervously]

Sorry. It's so nerve-racking in here.

that was shot so far in this movie?

Huh.

-[loud popping]
-[Johnny] Oh.

[group laughing]


-[cast laughing]
-[man] Jeez.

That was fiveÂ gallons of horse semen!

-[Wee Man spits]
-[laughs]

-[Steve-O groans]
-[spits, laughs]

-[all laughing]
-[man] Clear.

-[electricity crackles]
-[Wee Man yells]

-[chuckling] I'll fuck you up!
-[electricity crackling]

They told me
they was doing something. I forgot.

Sayin' they were scaring somebody else.

Next thing you know, I'm locked in a room.

But I never imagined
they'd put me in a room with a bear.

-[guys snickering]
-Hey, man!

-Hey, hey!
-[bear growling]

Hey, get that fuckin' bear, bro!
Hey! Aw, shit.

-Hey, man! What the fuck, bro?
-[bear growls]

-[both laughing]
-He's trying to hide!

[Dark Shark screaming]

-Help! Hey, man, get this damn thing, bro!
-[Johnny on PA] Dark Shark.

with a bear right now.

[on PA] Dark Shark,
those trees aren't real.

You can't climb them.

[both laughing]

[bear growls]

[Dark Shark screams]

-[Johnny laughing]
-[bear snorts]


Throughout the years, y'know,
I slowly developed more and more PTSD,

just like any of the other guys,
about what's really happening

or if we're getting pranked.

And I'm gonna have to say that that came,

for me, at a height
at Silence of the Lambs.

-That wasâ€¦ They took it too far.
-[loud bang]



and tortured for like 20 minutes straight.

It was terrifying.

want us to do--? Ow!


-You guys are fuckin' assholes!
-[man] Guess!

I hope it's funny, but, man, to be
in that moment, it wasâ€¦ it wasâ€¦

It was likeâ€¦

I thought I was gonna die,
and not aâ€¦ a painless death.

That wasâ€¦ I don't remember
being that scared, like, maybe ever.

Fuck!

[sighs, exhales deeply]

Oh, man, dude. I still don'tâ€¦

It's so hard to trust.
Is it over? Is it over?

[man 1] It's over.

-[woman chuckles]
-[man 2] It's over, bro.

I'm scared of what you guys do,
you guys go through.

-Like, no one's safe.
-[electricity crackles]

-[Ehren groans] Fuck! Why?
-[group laughing]

And, uh, I was, like,
kind of scared every time I showed up.

I was, likeâ€¦
I was very nervous the first day.

-[nurse 1] Get your temperature taken.
-[thermometer beeps]

[nurse 1] All right.
You're all good. There.

[mellow country music playing]

[nurse 2] Thank you.

-[Eric] Actually, I'm gonna pee quick.
-[woman] We're ready.

-[Eric] I'm gonna pee.
-[woman] Oh, okay. Go.

-[explosion blasts]
-[Eric screams]

-I fuckin' knew it!Â I fuckin' knew it!
-[group laughing]

-I knew it. I knew it, you motherfucker.
-[laughing]

I fuckin' knew it!

-[cracking up]
-[Wee Man] Yeah!

-[Preston] Yeah!
-Fired up!

-That thing caught on fire, dude.
-[Zach laughs]

-[man] Oh my God! Oh my God!
-[Eric] I peed, like, all over myself.

Went into the porta-potty,
and it fuckin' exploded.Â [laughing]

Like, hook, line, and sinker.

for a living.

And the whole cast
plays it so well, I had no idea.

It's one of those things.

When you watch it growing up,
you're in love with it,

but when you're actually there on set,
you're like, "This is fuckin' hardcore."

[in exaggerated British accent]
Hello, governor.

We're here withÂ Eric AndrÃ©,
world-famous elephant hunter.

And we're gonna do
a little big-game hunting today.

[in British accent] This might be
the diphtheria, but they look delicious.

-[Wee Man] That's fuckin' gnarly.
-[Zach] Which way are we gonna go?

[in British accent] If there's one thing
any schoolboy knows,

it's hunting big game requires a big gun.

[group laughs]

[Wee Man] This is a bad day
to be an elephant.

[Zach laughing] So bad.

It appears they're linked together.

-Is that how they snog?
-[group laughs]

["British Grenadiers" playing]


-[Eric] Aim for the mother!
-[Dave] Hup, hup!


Powder!

-[Eric] Thrust, thrust.
-And fire when ready.

[Eric shouts]

[Wee Man groans]


-[all laughing]
-[Poopies] Oh!

on the baby elephant.

Are you mad?

-[group groans]
-[Wee Man] Oh fuck!


He'll make a fine decoration
for the sitting room. Ha ha ha!

-[group laughs]
-[Dave] Fully reloaded!

They're getting tired.
We've got 'em tired.


-[all groan]
-[Johnny] Got him!

square in the bojangles.


-[man] Incoming!
-[Dave] He's down!

[Preston groans] Motherfucker, dudes.

Would someone provide this elephant
with a veterinarian?

He seems hurt.

-[Preston groans]
-[Jeff] Keep shooting. What are we doin'?

We gotta get it again.

We don't have this yet. Likeâ€¦
Can you take another? You're all right.

My favorite part of that
is Knoxville trying to get you

to go talk
to the elephants, who are upset.

And I feel like
that's a big part of the thing.

You guys are like--
You're good cop, bad cop.

You need to go talk to the elephants.

-They're good.
-[man] They're good.

-Preston's good to go?
-Preston, you're good, right?

It's startin' to swell up.

-Ah, fuck. It hurts so bad. Oh, shit.
-[Jeff] Let's reset. We're goin' again.

-Let's go after the bull.
-[Jeff] You guys are thirsty.

-You're around your watering hole.
-You guys go on one leg. Go on one leg.

-[Jeff] Just happy.
-[Johnny] Move the camera.

need to be on this side of the pond--

-[Jeff] Fuck!
-[Eric, in British accent] Good show!

-[all laughing]
-[Dave cheering]


[groans loudly]

It's weird, though.
They don't like seeing me get hit or hurt.

-Really?
-Yeah.

-What are you talkin' about?
-Yeah, what are you talking about?

What? Everyone cheers when,
like, I stun-gun you or, likeâ€¦

People were so happy
when you got shot by the elephant gun.

-Yeah.
-Are we ready?

I'm sorry. I'm on cloud nine.

-I dropped my accent and everything.
-[group laughs]

Oh my God.


But then our hunt
was rudely interrupted by an explosion.

I think-- Was itÂ Ehren
that was blasted out of the toilet?

-[explosion blasts]
-[Ehren screams]

-[shouts]
-[Johnny] Okay!

-Get him!
-[Johnny] Okay. Put the gun down!

-Gun down.
-It's loaded. It's hot!


[cast laughing]


Fuck you guys!

-[Johnny] Yeah! We got Ehren!
-[Chris] Holy shit!

[Ehren panting]

[group laughing]

-[Dave] It got you?
-[Ehren] What do you mean, did it get me?

We were shooting in the field,
and we saw a huge fireball from over here.

Everyone dropped the whole bit
and started running.


[group chuckling]

-[woman] Okay.
-[man] What are you, Johnny?

I'm a fuckin' flamingo. What do you think?

[man 1] What? I dunno.

So, what's gonna happen here
is we're swinging.

And they're coming down,
and they're gonna get in our way.

But our goal is to really damage them,

and their goal is to,
uh, somehow avoid us,

but they're not going to.

I'm Jasper,
and this is the Swingset Gauntlet.

-Mya!
-[Johnny] Ooh-whee!

-Nya!
-[Johnny scoffs]

-That's your cow sound?
-[man] That's your, uhâ€¦

-Yeah, I'm a different type of cow.
-[surf music playing]

go flyin' across the yard.

[man 1] Look at the pelican fly!
Come on, pelican!

[man 2] All right, start pumpin'.


[Johnny grunts]

[all laughing]

-Watch your head!
-[Jasper yelps]


[Jasper yelps, groans]

-[Chris laughs]
-[Dave] Oh.

[yelps, grunts]

[all groaning and laughing]

Are you okay?

Holyâ€¦

-Are you okay?
-Dude.

-[laughing] Holy shit!
-[Johnny] Are you all right?

in the air like a fuckin'â€¦

-[Dave spits]
-[Ehren] Dude!

-Did I do it right?
-[laughing] Oh my God!

-[Dave] I didn't even know what happened.
-[Ehren] Oh my God!

on my cool little box here.

Fuckin' dickhead Ehren
smashed the fuck outta me.

[Ehren laughs]

I landed back on this bullshit.

-[group laughs]
-[Johnny] Your head broke your landing.

[Chris in East Coast accent]
Hi, Nick Merlino. Bye, Nick Merlino.

[group laughing]

-I'm gonna clobber that crustacean.
-[all laugh]

Okay, go.

Get the speed, Chris.


[all groan and laugh]

[Chris laughing] Oh my God!

-[Johnny cracking up]
-[Ehren] Holy shit!

-Dude, he did, like, four flips. Dude.
-[Nick groans]

-[Chris] Dude.
-[Johnny] Pontius, that was a good one.

-Holy shit.
-[man 3] That was great.

-Dude.
-That fuckin' sucked.

[in East Coast accent]
Hey lobster, you lost?

-[man 4] Awesome.
-[all laughing]

[machine whirring]

to bring back Irving Zisman.

We haven't seen that guy in a while.

You gotta see the manager in here.

You should see the bunglestein on her.

-[laughs]
-I'd like to tap her like a keg.

Oh no. [laughs]


No?

What kind of a thing should Iâ€¦

'Cause she's a little sweet on me too.

Man.

-I feel like--
-She's about your age.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

Damn.

-Maybe--
-Don't go blowin' up my spot.


Yeah, I don't need
any cockblocks around here.

-[container pops]
-It's Brad?

-Yeah.
-[Irving, softly] You wanna have some fun?

-Yeah, man.
-[Irving] Okay.

[groans, grunts]

-[alarm blaring]
-[Irving] Oh.


[Irving exhales, groans]

Irving, what did youâ€¦
what did you do that for?

-What should we do now?
-[Irving laughs]

-Oh my goodness.
-Hold onto that.

That's a pretty nice soup bone.

Mm, my goodness,
check out the torpedo on that submarine.

-He's got a broomstick like a banana slug.
-[alarm stops]


Hi, Cheryl.

Oh, fuck. Hello, Irving.

-What the hell did you do now?
-I didn't do it. He pulled it.

What?

Why do what? You pulled it!
You said, "Watch this" and pulled it.

a cockblock? Talk me up.

You're bein' a cockblock. Talk me up.

He's your age,
so he's, like, trying to hit on you.

And it's not a good time
for you to do that.

-Iâ€¦
-What?

-What's your name?
-Brad.

-[Cheryl] Did you pull the fire alarm?
-No.

-[Cheryl] Okay. Irving says you did.
-I know--

raise your hand.

[men exclaim]

-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-What's your problem?

-Ah. Wow, this is my kind of party.
-[men laugh]

-All right.
-I kinda feel like partyin' right now.

[dance music playing on boom box]

[men exclaim]


-[men cheer]
-[Irving grunting]

[men clamoring]


-[man 1] C'mon!
-Yeah, man.

-Yeah, Brad!
-[Brad laughs]

-[man 2] Brad.
-[all cheering]



-[Johnny] Good luck, Wee Man.
-[Wee Man] Thanks.

camel toes I've ever seen.

[group laughs]

-[Chris grunts]
-Stop, okay?

-[both laugh]
-Oh my God.

I'm Wee Man, and this is the Ballknocker.

[machinery whirring]

-[Steve-O] It's fuckin' party time, man.
-[man 1] Yeah.

[Preston grunts]

[machinery stops]

-[Johnny] Three, two, one, go!
-[Wee Man grunts]

-[Wee Man groans]
-[man 2] Oh shit!

-[all groan and laugh]
-[Steve-O claps]


[Preston, Zach, and Wee Man groaning]

-Wee Man, are you okay? Holy shit.
-[man 3] Jason? Jason, speak.

-[man 4] That was intense.
-[Johnny] You okay?

-Yeah.
-Talk. Talk, talk.

-Am I bleedin'?
-[group] No.

-[Johnny] How did that feel?
-[Wee Man] It felt like a car crash.

-[Johnny] It looked like a car crash.
-[Wee Man] Fuck.


-[Johnny] How do you feel, Zach?
-[Zach] Dude, my asshole hurts.

-[group laughing]
-[Wee Man] How does your asshole hurt?

I don't wanna hear anything about that.

-You asked me how I felt.
-I know. But why does that hurt?

-I don't know! [laughs]
-[group chuckles]

-I don't know!
-I don't know what bit you just did.

[Zach and Wee Man laughing]

So, on Wildboyz, we filmed this bit

where we were in Africa,
and we had fish attached to strings.

Like, cinched up around our packages.

It's time for a little penis fishing.
We're fishing for fish eagles!

would swoop down, grab the fish,

and then yank our packages taught.

-[Wee Man inhales sharply, screams]
-[Chris groans, laughs]

[Wee man shrieking and laughing]

[Chris laughing] Oh my God!

But MTV wouldn't let us air it.
It was a little graphic.

And so we thought,
"Well, let's try to do that idea."

Like, I got word
that this guy had two fish eagles.

I'm like, "Ah, fish eagles.
I've got an idea for that."

I gotta tell ya, breaking bones
and shovin' things up your butt

doesn't get any easier with age.

I'm just kidding.

Shovin' things up your butt
gets a lot easier.

I'm Steve-O,
and this is the Dine and Dash.

[group chuckles]

-Oh no.
-Oh God.

The basic idea
was shove a fish up Steve-O's butt

and have an eagle come
and just grab the fish hard

and fly off,
hopefully grabbing some of his butt

and flying away with it.

But the fish eagle just,
kinda just gently lands next to him.

[Steve-O] Oh my God.
I just saw his fuckin' beak.

-[Chris] He's checkin' it.
-[Jasper] Just smack it.

-[eagle cries]
-[Rachel] Oh my God.

-Ow!
-[Rachel] Oh my God!

-I saw it come out of his asshole!
-Ow! Oh!

-Ow!
-[Jeff] He got the first fish easily.

So, well, we gotâ€¦
we gotta make something out of this.

So, we just stuffed the fish
a little further up in there

and wrapped it up
around his balls and stuff. [chuckles]

Do you want to, uh,
really rub the fish all over my balls?

[man 1] Ooh.

-I can.
-[group laughs]


Jesus Christ. How big are his nuts?

-I don't know how-- My God.
-[group laughs]


-You're a genius.
-[Chris] I want that back, though.

-[Johnny] I need--
-[screams]

-[Johnny] Wait, Steve-O, I'm not--
-Hey, no cheap shot!

-It doesn't get any cheaper than this.
-[Steve-O laughs]

-[man 2] Let him get every last scrap.
-[Steve-O chuckling]

Come on, man. That's HomeTown Buffet.

-Oh shit.
-[Steve-O screams]

His beak is so fuckin' gnarly. Oh shit.

-[man 3] Need to go for it.
-Oh shit! [groans]

-[eagle cries]
-Ah. [groans]

-[exhales]
-[Rachel] Eat more.

-Oh! [yells]
-[group exclaims]


-[Steve-O shrieking]
-[eagle chewing loudly]

[group laughing]

-[crunches]
-[Steve-O screams]

Ow!

Here I am, like, butt naked.

I got, like, stickin' stuff up my butt,

and my balls were on the line.

-[crunches]
-[Steve-O screams]

-[shrieking] Oh! Oh!
-[group laughs nervously]

-He literally ate your ass.
-[Steve-O] Oh, he really did.

-Does it look sweet?
-[Johnny] Give Pontius his hair tie back.

Dude, I'm gonna sell this on eBay.

-[laughs]
-Yeah.

-[chuckles]
-I'm not surprised that bit's in 4.5.

-But I wasn't givin' up on the raptors.
-Yeah.

So, we got a raptor
to rip off my eyebrows.

That was amazing.

-Put your chin down.
-Okay.

After we're all done, after it's all over,

I want you to relax
with some cucumber and elderflower water.

[Dark Shark] That's crazy.
Look at that big motherfucker.

-Do you like birds?
-I ain't sayin'Â nothin'.

Yeah, no. I'm scared of birds.
You can't tell I keep jumpin'?

Dark Shark was funny during that bit
because he's so scared of birds.

Yeah, I'mâ€¦ I been scared of birds
since I was, like, ten years old.

You know, I got a phobia.

-[man] We're ready to go.
-Oh, shit! Oh, damn.

-[group chuckles]
-Oh, shit.

[Dark Shark] That motherfucker
ready to go, got business.

I'm serious.

[Johnny snickers]

I'm gonna be well groomed.

You're gonna be as smooth as the new guys.

[group chuckles nervously]

-[raptor cries]
-[hair rips]

[group laughs]

Let's see. [chuckles]

Got one little bit still left. [laughs]


That's the way
they're wearing them these days.

-[hair rips]
-Ow. [sighs]

Know what? I have those eyebrows.

-I saved them.
-Oh, did you?

I thought it'd be a good idea.

After 4.5 comes out, we can auction them
off to charity to help the kids.

-That's great.
-Yeah.


If you think I look good now, just wait.

-Job's only just begun.
-[both chuckle]

Yeah, I didn't even realize
how badly I missed working with Chris

until we started shooting this movie.

Yeah, we just have the best time.

Yeah, I think it makes us become better
than our own individual selves.

It makes our personalities multiply.

Chris and I together
is better than the sum of its parts.

-That's the word, yes.
-[chuckles]

once we ripped his eyebrows off,

now we got Steve-O with no eyebrows,

and we're only two-thirds of the way
through the movie, soâ€¦ [chuckles]

[Steve-O] I walked out, and I was like,
"What the hell ramp is that, dude?"

Like, "What kind
of sissy operation is this?"

And then I found out
that he's wearin' a rocket pack.

I'm like, "Okay, cool.Â I'm in." [laughs]

-[harp playing]
-Welcome to my Fantasy Island.

Today, we got a couple
of hot-shit water skiers,

Parks Bonifay, Poopies,

a rocket jet pack.

I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

Oh, and we also got,
uh, Bunny the Lifeguard.

-[Chris] Kind of a new alter ego.
-[Johnny laughs]

-[Chris] Creepy porno dude.
-[group laughs]

-[Wee Man] "Creepy porno dude."
-Yeah, there we go.


[group laughs]

rocket-powered backpacks,

and he's gonna edge out
of the big red kicker.

And then he's got a little strap here,
and as soon as you pull that,

she kicks, and you're goin'
for a ride for eight seconds.

hit the jet pack for additional thrust.

I'm Bunny the Lifeguard,

and this is Hot Shit Water Skiing,
take 69.

-["Vacation" playing]
-Yeah.

-[Parks] You good?
-[Poopies] Yeah.

â™ª Get my mind off of you â™ª

-[Dave] Get it!

-â™ª I wish I'd stayedâ€¦ â™ª
-[jet pack whooshes]

-[Johnny] Oh no!
-[group laughing]


about 20 feet before the ramp.

I pulled it, and I think I fell forward.

into the water.


â™ª And I still
Haven't gotten over you yetâ€¦ â™ª


I'm feelin' good about this one.

-â™ª Vacation, had to get away â™ª
-[Chris grunting]

â™ª Vacation, meant to be spent aloneâ€¦ â™ª

[cast cheering]


-[jet pack whooshes]
-[group cheering and laughing]

â™ª Vacation, had to get away â™ª

-[jet pack whooshes]
-â™ª Vacation, meant to be spent alone â™ª

[Steve-O] Yeah, Poops!


Let's get his ass in the peanut gallery
and give Parks a chance.

-Yeah, Parks!
-He's locked in.

-Yeah!
-[group cheering]

-[Johnny] Locked in.
-[motor revving]

â™ª Vacation, all I ever wantedâ€¦ â™ª

[Steve-O] Shit! He's haulin' ass!

-[jet pack whooshes]
-[Ehren] Oh shit!

[group cheering wildly]

â™ª Meant to be spent aloneâ€¦ â™ª

[Wee Man] The plane!Â The plane!

-[bell ringing loudly]
-[all continue cheering]

â™ª Vacation, had to get away â™ª

â™ª Vacation, meant to be spent alone â™ª

Dude, I knew when I was up there
it was gonna hurt, and then it hurt.


-[man 1] You ready?
-[man 2] Yep.

[Johnny laughs] Oh shit!

-Are you okay?
-[Jasper laughing] Yeah.

[man 3] I didn't have a first try.

-[Wee Man] You didn't hit the apple!

Um, my worst injury

-[puck thuds]
-[Ehren groans]


[Ehren screams]

-[Johnny] Easy!
-[group groaning and laughing]


Danger Ehren's crotch get mutilated

while I was on set helped me

feel comfortable
'cause I would just be, like,

anytime I got hurt,

I was like, "It's not as bad as getting
a pogo stick to your testicles."

They're ripped to shreds.

I mean, I think you guys--
you lit him up more brutal in this movie

than, uh, the previous three.

Meh, I don't know.

You ripped his fuckin' tooth out

and cracked his skull in half
and broke his neck three times

and threw him into a wall.

-[Jeff] Keep hittin' him!
-[Ehren groaning]


how you destroy Ehren.

I'm here with professional bowler
Missy Parkin,

and this is
the Cup Test with a Bowling Ball.

And I will let you know that I do use
the heaviest ball you're allowed to use.

-Oh God.
-I use a 16-pound bowling ball.

I don't know if this is the right cup.

-It's got--
-[Johnny] Yeah, it's right.

It's got really bad edges. Like, it'll--

Missy, what do you think
of Ehren's chances?

I mean, I'm gonnaâ€¦
I'm gonna definitely hit that, soâ€¦

[group laughs]

-This isâ€¦ this is the danger zone.
-[Missy laughs]

Uh, please just hit him, Missy.

-[Missy] Okay.
-[Ehren takes a deep breath]

[inhales sharply] Oh God.

Oh my God. I don't know what to do.

[screams, groans]

-Oh, that was on the leg!
-[group groans]

[Ehren continues grunting]

[pins clatter]

-[cast and Missy laugh]
-[Johnny] Hey!


-It hit you on the leg first.
-[Wee Man] The leg slowed it.

-[Johnny] That was deflected.
-Are you sure? It didn't feel like it.

That wasâ€¦ It went, "Boom, boom."



Dude, I'm not gonna take one
like that again. I can't.

-[Johnny] Missy did her job perfectly.
-It's in my butthole.

Like, I swear to God,
it's hurting in my butthole.

[cast and Missy laugh]

-Sit down!Â Sit down!
-I don't think I can do it, man.

-I can't do it!
-[Jeff] You have to sit down!

-I can't do it!
-[Jeff] Wanna do it while he's standing?

Jackass 4: Breaking Ehren.

Do you think he could go again?

I think he could absolutely go again.
You could do one more.

She's a professional, Ehren.

-Come on. Man up.
-[Ehren] I just, likeâ€¦

[group laughing]


Am I in the right position?

Ehren.

[group chuckles]

-[Ehren grunts]

-[Missy laughing] Ehren?

[group gasps and exclaims]

-[Ehren] Ah God, dude!
-[Missy inhales sharply]


Oh, Ehren's always had my respect,
even though he can be annoying.

Like, he always gets great footage,
and he, like,

is amazing in Jackass Forever.

I mean, 'course,
he didn't mean to be. [laughs]

But he was.

I'm Poopies, and I'll show me.


[group laughs]

-Dude.
-[Johnny] Like Steve-O.

That was a knocker, bro.

-Ah, my teeth hurt.
-[Johnny chuckles]


[group laughing]


[Steve-O] You showed you.

Fuck me. I just fucked myself right there.

[group laughing]

on the Paramount back lot,

where they shot The Godfather,

Chinatown, Breakfast at Tiffany's.

And we're shooting Zach Sashimi. [laughs]

Mm-mm! This is Zach Sashimi. Everyone?

Find a fold and put in the sashimi.

-Got some nice tits, Zach.

-[Zach yells]

[Steve-O laughs]

-[Chris] Whoa. Watch it slide.
-[Steve-O exclaims]



Are you ready
to get in the best shape of your life?

[group laughs]

[Steve-O] Time for some wind sprints.

in Zach's own juices.

-[Rachel] Much like ceviche.
-[Steve-O] Oh, man.

-[Chris] Really focus on that form.
-[Ehren] Fitness.

Oh.

-[Chris] Jog now.
-[Johnny] Go, Zach.

I'm gettin' harder
than Portland cement right now.

-[Zach panting]
-[Johnny] All right, let's get started.

-[Rachel] I'm goin' in.
-[Johnny] It's belly-button time.

this doesn't just become chaos.

[group laughs]

-[Steve-O] Yeah!
-[group groans]

-[Poopies] Oh!
-[Ehren] Oh, wow.

-[Poopies] Great job, Rachel.
-[Preston] How could you?

I've had worse things.

-[group laughs]
-Fuck, that was gross.

-In here.
-[Preston] Like a petri dish.

It's slippery from his sweat.

like a bear going for salmon.

[group laughs]

-[Rachel] Yeah!
-[Poopies] Superfood.

-[Chris retches]
-[Johnny] Superfood.

-[group laughs]
-[Chris retching]


-[vomit splashes]
-[group groans]

This is the first bit we've ever shot
on the Paramount back lot,

and may be, well, our last.

[group laughs]

Open up, Bubba.

-[Zach retches]
-[Johnny laughs]

-[Zach coughs]
-You got it. Swallow it.

-[Poopies] You got this.
-[Chris] Hold your ground!

-[retches]
-[man] Oh, gross.

[Steve-O] It's disgusting Zach
more than anyone.

[Zach gasps]

-[Johnny] The thong.
-[Steve-O] Gotta be something in there.


-[Poopies] Wow.
-[Chris] Look at how slick he is.

-Oh. Ugh.
-[Poopies retches]

All right. Hey, guys.

You like shrimp?

with Steve-O's name on it.

Steve, feast on that eel.

Should Iâ€¦ should I do it no hands?

Steve-O going for the no-hander.

-[Steve-O] That's wet-ass bootie.
-[Chris] No-hander.

Oh yeah. [retches]

-[Poopies] This is not--
-[Johnny] Leaning down in everyone's puke.

-[Steve-O retching and groaning]
-[group laughing]


[Steve-O coughing and retching loudly]


No, no, no, no, no.

[Steve-O and Zach retch]

-[Poopies] You got it, Steve-O.
-[Johnny] Hold it together.

[Steve-O groans and retches loudly]


Feels like we've really crossed a line.

-[vomit splashes]
-[Johnny laughs] Oh God.

I can't believe it.

-[Lance retches]
-[Johnny] Focus. How you doin', Lance?

-[Lance coughing]
-[Johnny] Can we get Lance another mask?

How many times
did you puke this film, Lance?

I tried to stay off camera.

in past movies and six times in this one.

[Lance retching]

-That was a record.
-That's a record.

I came for sushi, but I had salad.

[all laughing]

Jeff was joking with me before

about like, "You're gonna find sushi
somewhere when you get home."

And I was thinking,
"Oh, ha ha. You know, whatever."

I'm pretty sure
he found one two days later.

He sent me a photo of a piece of sashimi
that he found two days later. [laughs]


-[Rachel] Hello.
-Hi. How's it going?

-[Rachel] Good.
-Hi.

-This is my grandpa.
-[woman] Hi.

Hi.

-My name is Alex. How are you?
-Good.

-Alex?
-Alex, yeah.

-Irving.
-Irving.

-I'm Rachel.
-Hi, Rachel.

Um, so, I just have
a couple meetings today,

and I just need you to, like,
sit with him for a couple hours.

You don't have to babysit him,
but just kinda keep an eye on him.

And then just one thing.
Like, just make sure he doesn't smoke.

Like, that's all.

-All right. Thank you so much.
-Of course.

-Have fun, Grandpa. Be good, okay?
-[Irving] All right, baby doll.

-[Rachel] Love you.
-Right.

-[Alex] It was Irving, right?
-Yes.


There's a little coffee truck
right around the corner.

Wouldâ€¦ would you mind getting me a coffee?

-Do you want black coffee?
-Please.

-With no sugar? Nothing?
-No sugar.

I'm sweet enough.

[energetic music playing]


-Where are you?
-[Irving] Help!

-Where are you?
-[Irving] Help?

Whoa.

-How did you get up there?
-Help.


-Don't move.
-[Irving] Oh my God.

-[Irving groans]
-[Alex] Don't move.

-No! No, you're not supposed to smoke.
-[Irving] I gotta smoke. I'm nervous.

-[Irving] Mm.
-[Alex] Don't move.

[line ringing]

-[Irving] Mm. Mm.
-Oh my God, please. You're gonna fall.

Oh! Oh! Ah!


[Irving shrieks]

-[Alex] Oh my God!
-Oh shoot! [grunts, yells]

Throw the coffee!Â Throw the coffee!

Oh, ow! Ow!

Throw it!Â Throw it!

Ow! [groans]

-[screams, groans]
-[wheelchair clatters]

[Irving grunting]

Don't move. You're gonna fall!

[Irving groans]

You want a smoke?

No, I don't want a smoke.

Do you have weed?

I don't have weed.

Do you have acid?

-No, I don't.
-[Irving] Come on!

-[grunts]
-[Alex] Oh my God!

[Irving groans]

Oh! Oh my God!


Oh, my back!

Okay.


-[clangs loudly]
-Ow!

-I haven't been able to walk in two years.
-[Alex gasps]

-Okay.
-Bless you.

[Irving sighs]

You're giving me a heart attack.

[Zach chuckles]

Get some of thisâ€¦

in the folds.

-Thank you.
-[laughs]


He really likes
all the detail and everything.

Getting in every crevice, under each roll.

Makes sure you're painted really well.

become familiar with Jeff's work?

I sawâ€¦ like, when I was a little kid, uhâ€¦

When I was in elementary school,

I was told
I wasn't allowed to watch Jackass.

And I justâ€¦ I would haveÂ to,
like, sneak to watch it on TV. [chuckles]

Yeah. I lived in a super,
like, Christian household,

and they were, likeâ€¦

They were just anti-MTV and everything.

So, I would just watch it and have
another channel on the channel return.

It was pretty dope. [laughs]

-[man] Three, twoâ€¦
-[Johnny] Shirt looks a little small.

take the extra-large tag

and put it in a size medium shirt.


-It's a tuck deal?
-[Emily] Yeah. You gotta tuck it.

You left me
a lot of room to tuck, asshole.

[group laughing]

It was funny because when they set it up,
it was supposed to be a winch,

but the winch wasn't gonna work out,
so they just tied a truck to me.

I was just pulled by a truck.

-That's really somethin' else.
-This is half-assed, even for us.


-[Wee Man] That's a big ball.
-[Johnny] That's a really big ball.

Four hundred pounds
of baseball right there.

I'm Zach, and it's time to Play Ball.

Some people call this pitch a slider.

I call it a spitball.

-[Zach chuckles nervously]
-[spits]

[group laughs]

We got a game to play.

-All right. 'Kay.
-Let's do it.

I warn you, I'm wearing sexy lingerie
under this uniform.

[both chuckle]

["Charge" playing on organ]

Batter, batter, batter! Batter, swing!

-[Zach] Whoa!
-[Zach, Johnny, and Wee Man groan]

[Zach laughing and moaning]

[Wee Man grunts]

-[Poopies] You all right?
-[Zach] Oh my God! Are you okay?

Strike!

[Zach laughing]

Good job, you guys. That was awesome.

-Jasper, way toâ€¦
-[Jasper] Yes, sir.


-[Zach, Johnny, and Wee Man groan]
-[clamoring]


Yeah, like, granted,
we had these just mini pads on,

like baseball players, but he took us out.

[thuds loudly]

[Wee Man] He knocked me
outta my shoes too.

Sorry, guys.
I didn't know my own strength.

[group laughing]

a whip the size of a license plate?

-[thwacks]
-[group grunts]

Fuck!

-[rider] I'm so sorry.
-[Jaws] Jesus!

-Oh yeah.
-Fuck you! Ow!

Oh my God! That sounded terrible.

Like, right--

-[thwacks]
-[Jaws] Fuck!

And it hurts!

It was right on the very fucking head
of my dick. Sorry for the coarse language.

-[rider] Ah.
-[group laughs]

This is the Blindfold Race.

We'll have four contestants
compete in a 50-yard sprint,

blindfolded.

It's a simple racetrack.

There's nothin' in the way.
It's a clear path.

Then right when you put on
those blindfolds,

oh, here comes all the objects
that we're gonna pretty much fall over

and get destroyed on,
but we didn't know they were there.

-I think Poopies' is good.
-Yeah, I can't see shit.

[group laughs]

I didn't expect anything
to be in that runway at all.


Okay. On the gunshot, you will run.

-["People Who Died" playing]
-On your mark, get setâ€¦

-[gun fires]
-Go, go, go, go!

-â™ª Fell from the roof on East Two-Nine â™ª
-[Johnny] Keep going! Run!

-[group clamoring]
-â™ª Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug â™ª

â™ª On 26 reds and a bottle of wine â™ª

â™ª Bobby got leukemia, 14 years old
He looked 65 when he diedâ€¦ â™ª

-[Johnny] Run! Run, Poopies!
-[gun fires]


Get 'em, Poopies.

-[man 1] He got it, yes!
-[indistinct shouting]

Run, Poopies!

â™ª Those are people who died, diedâ€¦ â™ª

[Wee Man laughs]

â™ª And just diedâ€¦ â™ª

[man 2] Go, Jasper, go!

Go, Jasper, go! Fast!

â™ª So they died of hepatitis

-[Johnny] Go, Poopies!

-Yeah, that way.
-â™ª Two more friends that died â™ª

This way. Follow my voice.

-[Johnny] Run, Wee Man!
-[Wee Man grunts]

-Go, Wee Man!
-[group laughing]

Go, go, go, Wee Man!

â™ª Those are people who died, died
They were all my friendsâ€¦ â™ª

All right!

-And the winner is Poopies!
-[Wee Man] Aw, man!

Wow!

-Man, he was in a full sprint.
-[Poopies] I got whacked so hard.

He hit his head really hard
on that sawhorse.



I was telling you--

â€¦twenty seconds ahead ofâ€¦
30 seconds ahead.

I know. I know.
I felt the marbles, and I was like, "Oh!"

And thenâ€¦ 'Cause none of that stuff
was out there.

-[Ehren] No way! Really?
-[group laughing]

Well, Captain Obvious.

-So, I was likeâ€¦
-That's my horse.

Yeah.

[LakmÃ©: Act I: "The Flower Duet" playing]

-[Chris] Whoo-hoo!
-[all laughing]


[Steve-O] Ow! Fuck!

-Ow, ow, ow, ow.
-[woman] I'm sorry.

[Steve-O groaning] Oh, fuck!

[music fades]

[clicks tongue] Look, we're not just
growing old, we're growing up.

Join me in the fight
against unwanted pregnancy

by buying my signature Steve-O condom,

the Dick Helmet, at steveo.com.

They're virtually unbreakable. Watch.

signature condom break.

[group laughing]

I had the idea
when I saw this, uh, condom-drop thing

with putting the condom on people's heads.

[Chris laughs]

As soon as I saw it, I thought, "Oh, man,

fill up a condom
with the sewage tank on my RV,

and then that'll be epic."

So, for weeks on end,

I justÂ belligerently refused
to empty the sewage tank on my RV.

from you and all your bros?

[Steve-O] I've been saving up
for weeks, dude.

-[group groans]
-[Eric] Oh my! Oh gosh!

[Poopies retches]

-[Steve-O] These are quality condoms.
-[Ehren] Yuck.

-[Poopies retches, groans]
-[Steve-O chuckles]

-[Wee Man] Wow.
-[Jasper] That's not apple juice.

I can't. [retches]

trying to accomplish?


which he stopped selling after that bit.

[inhales sharply] Boy.

They were poppin' like paper bags.

-Ow!
-[all groan]

-Oh!
-[Poopies retching]

[all groaning]

You might've wanted to test this idea
before you brought it toâ€¦ to the set.

-[group laughs]
-Oh my God.

That Steve.

[group clamoring]

-[all groan]
-Put your finger in it!

-Put your finger in it!
-[moans, retches] Oh God.

-[Johnny] Don't get greedy.
-[group laughs]


-[Johnny] Okay.
-[Chris] That's your bowels.

[group yells]


That's a shitty condom.

[all laughing]

Oh my God!

I got it. I got it.

-[both scream]
-[group laughs]


Yeah, we were trying to fill it up
and get the most we could in it.

And lucky me was right there
when it was about to burst, and it did.

And just got loads of flecks
on my face, on my clothes.

It's in my mouth!

-[all groan]
-[Wee Man] Oh no!

-[Jasper exclaims]
-Oh!

-We never quite got it, right?
-We never got it.

Either the condom
would bounce off my headâ€¦

One, two, three.

God!

â€¦or it would break on my head.

We had to have tried it like 15 times.

No!

[Wee Man] â€¦three.

Fuck! [sighs]

Fuck!

-[grunts]
-[Ehren groans]

I'm Poopies, and this is pee pee.


Seriously, there's so much piss
on you, dude.

[group laughing]

So, you have a signature condom, though.

I was toying with the idea
of coming out with Steve-O condoms.

And in hindsight,
that's the worst idea I've ever had

because condoms and Steve-O
have never been a good mix.

[both laugh]

-[indistinct chatter]
-[man 1] It's red only.

[man 2 whistling]

-[Chris chuckles]
-[guys catcalling]



Whoo. Six to midnight.

That's that hot-shit tennis coach
I was talking about earlier.

I think it was my first day on set,
so I was geeking out.

I was like,
"This is how the sausage gets made."

"This is fuckin' awesome."

I'm putting on my clown outfit

and taking in the whole cast
and crew and seeing how it's done.

And then I was like, "Oh no. This sucks."

Like, "I'm gonna get a tennis ball
to the fuckin' neck and the balls."

This is our tennis star, Shannon,

and it's time to play Down the Clown.

-Be gentle with me.
-[Shannon] Mm-hmm.

So, how fast do you serve, Shannon?

Up to 100 miles per hour.

-Hey?
-[Shannon] Mm-hmm?

-Uh, Poopies said he doesn't believe you.
-[circus music playing]

-You don't?
-[Poopies] I didn't say that.

-Totally said that!
-He said it!

-Oh, I'm mad now.
-[Johnny] Yeah.


-[groans]
-[all grunt]

-Oh!
-[Shannon giggles]

[group laughs]


-[Shannon laughs]
-The fuck?

-You need to get Poopies.
-Yeah. Poopies is the one way left.

Way left.

-[Chris] Poopies' wiener is asking for it.
-[Shannon grunts]

-[Poopies groans]
-[group cheering and laughing]

-[man] Yeah!
-[thuds loudly]

-[group applauds]
-[Eric] Yeah!

-[Chris] Calm down.
-[Eric] Right.

[group laughing]

What about this side, Shannon?

Ow. Motherfucker! Goddamn it!

Leave the rookies alone!

-[Shannon grunts]
-[groans]

[Eric cheers]

He only has one ball, and you hit it.

[group and Shannon laughing]

-I gotta get that middle one.
-[Wee Man] Ooh.

-[Shannon grunts]
-[Johnny groans]


-I've gotten hit.Â Oh shit.
-[Shannon grunts]


[group groaning]

-[Shannon grunts]
-[Eric yelps] Oh!

[Steve-O laughs]

-[Shannon grunts]
-[Eric groans]

-She hit me twice!
-[Poopies] Oh, man.

Oh, one man standing.

Chest up.Â Chest up.

-[Ehren] Chest up!
-[Chris] Make me proud.

-[Shannon] Yeah.
-[Steve-O grunts]

[Wee Man] Get him good.

[Shannon grunts]

-[group groaning and laughing]
-[Shannon] C'mon!


Yeah, Shannon. Whoo.

-Yes. Oh my God.
-Nice.

-[Steve-O] God!
-Nice.

[Steve-O] Oh God,
that was so fuckin' right on.

-[Shannon chuckles]
-[Steve-O] Thank you, Shannon.

[group laughs]

Way to go.

-[scoffs] You're welcome?
-[Chris grunts, sighs]

I heard Knoxville
go over to that tennis professional,

and he goes,
"See that big fat guy over there?"

"I want you to hit him right here."

Where I'd been shot by the elephant gun.

And I thought that it'd be pretty hard
for that tennis lady to do that.

But no, she could curve it right there.

-[man 1] Whoa.
-[man 2] Let's see.

[man 3] Let's see, P.

[man 4] Oh my God! She hit that?

-This center part is new.
-[man 5] How dare you!

-[Chris] Literally a bull's-eye.
-This is new.

-[Chris] It's like tie-dye.
-[group laughs]

All right, you guys. We're up
in one of the buildings right here,

and, um, they're filming the opening,
so, take a look.

[director on PA] Background and action!

-[explosions blast]
-[extras screaming]

[Eric laughs] Whoa, dude.

-[group chuckling]
-Oh my God!

Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
Welcome to Jackass!

of Jackass Forever

started off as a much smaller idea.

We wanted to do
this sort of '70s monster movie,

where Chris's penis
was attacking a miniature city.

The airbrush is chillier
on the balls. [chuckles]

-It was never gonna be the opening.
-Right.

It was always gonna be a bit.


Well, the sea monster
is going to lay waste to this town.

in the proper position

for, uh, the sea monster to perform.

There we go.

I see the fearsome sea monster.

I mean, poor Chris was
in the most awkward position

'cause he's under the set.

like you're having sex with the set.

I kind of am.

in the middle of the street,

and Chris had to fit his penis through it.

his balls,

kept dropping down
from underneath the, uh, sandpaper street

we had built for him.


-I've gotta push your balls through, okay?
-No worries.

-Okay. This is me, Pontius.
-[Chris] No worries.

and I knew I had a solution.

And by God, I was right there.

And if Pontius needed me to do that again,
I'd be there again.

when I came to work today.

Let's go.

-[Johnny exhales]
-[man 1] Well done.

-Yeah, moviemaking.
-[man 2] Mm-hmm.

I think as soon as we started shooting it
that day, we were like,

"This is a great idea,"
and then we looked at the test footage.

-[dramatic music playing]
-[monster howling]

[smoke hisses]


And that's when we decided to make it
the open and not just a bit.

[monster roars]

-[Spike] I started getting excited.
-And then the idea started growing.


[explosion blasts]

-Yeah. Then the idea started growing.
-And then kept growing.

[monster coughs, cries, growls]

[soldiers groan]

Yeah, it kept growing.

And the budget kept expanding.

-It kept doubling.
-It kept doubling.

-[director] Background and action!
-[extras screaming]

[explosions blast]

I just wanted it to be right.

And I would settle for no--
nothing but the best.

Every time Spike
opened his mouth, it was just, like,

millions of dollars
were just falling out of it.

-[both laugh]
-Uhâ€¦


-[man] Hey!
-[Steve-O] It's a big deal, dude.

It's an expensive dick joke.

[Steve-O] The opening sequence
and the ending

have always felt
like real,Â blockbuster Hollywood.

-[Chris] Yeah.
-We feel like movie stars when we do this.

Oh, yeah. It's so fun.

-Rest of the time, we feel like schmucks.
-Yeah. Exactly.

-[machinery whirring]
-[Steve-O thudding and grunting]

-Okay, stop! Stop.
-[man 1] He said, "Stop."

[Steve-O breathing heavily]

-[poop splattering]
-[shoes squeak]

-[Steve-O] I hit my head fuckin' hard.
-[woman] Listen, lay down that way.

[Steve-O groans, spits]




-[woman] We-- We good?
-[man 2] No, we don't.

It was really strenuous to film.

It wasâ€¦ it got so physically demanding.

I'd always be in these weird positions.

He's completely vulnerable too.

And it's cold
where we were shooting, and, like--

And we're shooting pyro
that he can't even see.

There's all this pyro on either side,
just blasting little debris into his dick,

and he doesn't even see it coming.

about these puppeteers.

It's very exciting.

The puppeteers are very exciting people.

[puppeteer chuckles]

My favorite thing is, like,

we pulled out, like,
the best people on every level.

The guy who's puppeteering it,
he's the guy who did

the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
in Ghostbusters.

He's just got this list of credentials.

We brought in Elia Popov,
who does special effects

for these huge blockbuster movies.

And this really talented DP, Shasta Spahn.

And our production designer,
Shepherd Frankel, who does Marvel movies,

designed this amazing set for us.

-And Tony Gardner's done these really--
-[Spike] Academy Award-nominated movies.

to the top.

We're just dragging everybody down
to their lowest.

They brought their A-level skills
to our D-level idea.

[all laugh]

Why did we come up with so many ideas
that were penises? What was ourâ€¦

Apparently, as you get olderâ€¦

-That's all you can think of?
-It's all you can think of.

[all laugh]

But Jackass Forever has more penis in it

than any R-rated movie
in the history of R-rated movies.

-[Spike] More penis hits or more penis?
-[Jeff] Just penis in it.

Penises are biologically fascinating
and so underused,

like, as far as movies go
and just entertainment.

I don't know why.

It's like, little boys know it.

When you're a little boy, you run around,
doing crazy stuff with your penis.

Flippin' it around,
peein' on things, doing all this stuff.

It's like, why do we all forget that
as we go into adulthood, y'know?

So, thank heavens
that we didn't. [chuckles]

'Cause there's so much
you can do with it.

Now it's time
for a friendly game of chance.

Here we stand,
with our penises tethered to bricks

that we're going to drop
to the ground below.

Unfortunately, one of the strings
is too short.

Actually, two of the strings
are too short.

I wonder who it is.

[group laughing]

We don't know.
That's why we have to play the game.

-I know, dude.
-[Johnny] Are we ready?

Three, two, one, drop.

[Steve-O grunts]

[Steve-O and Dave scream]

[group groans]

-[Chris] Bro.
-[Steve-O moans]

-[Chris] Yeah.
-Ow.

-[Steve-O moans]
-Oh, it's bleeding.Â Oh, it's bleeding.


-[Dave screaming]
-[Johnny] Oh shit!

The thing is, is where you tie it
is behind your balls.

So, I only have one ball,

so I don't have that anchor point
that some of the other guys do.

Threw the brick, and it slid past that
and caught me mid-shaft

and just pinched as tight as it could

and then stretched my wiener to aâ€¦
I'm gonna have to say a good foot long.

I really don't think you could come closer
to ripping your dick off than that.

I really don't think you can, and I am
so dumb for agreeing to do it at all.

-Just, the vein.
-[group groans]

-My dick's ruined!
-[Steve-O] Oh!


[Steve-O] It has love spikes now.

That bit was like a bruised dick.
You just can't beat it.

[group laughs]

Making these movies is really probably
the funnest thing that I think you can do.

God. What a great time it's been,
hanging out with all your friends.

It's so rare to have the chemistry
of thisâ€¦ of a group of people

that come together
to make something like this.

And every single person
is so important to the mix.

Everyone was gonna make this one count.
It was obvious.

It felt like we were all unsure
going into it,

but coming out of it,
it felt as good as all the others.

In the friendships that not only remain,

but have gotten stronger
over the years, uh,

really mean a lot, and, uh, for us
to still be doing this after 20 yearsâ€¦

For there to be interest
and for us to physically be able

and for it to be as fun as it is,
I think that's special.

So what we have
behind me is my dad, Dark Shark.

He made his name up himself, but this man
is a OG Crip gangbanger from Los Angeles.

Doesn't bang anymore,
but been through a lot.

Been to prison multiple times,
probably did a lot of dirt in the hood.

You know, been through--
How many times you been shot?

Got nine bullet holes in me.


But when it comes
to little things like birds

and flying in a, I don't know, a airplane,

just simple things
you don't see in the hood,

it makes him very scared.

Dark Shark is terrified of flying,
and, uhâ€¦

So we thought, "All right.
What's the scariest thing we could do?"

Let's make him skydive.

Then we started adding on to the bit.

Like, "Yeah, let's make him skydive.
Let's make everything go wrong."

This is Jasper,
and today we're gonna fulfill

your father's lifelong dream
of jumping out of a plane.

He's very excited.

-Yes.
-He's not excited.

I'm scared as fuck.
You know what I'm sayin'?

Scared as fuck, fuck, fuck.

But, um, y'know,
I'm with the big boys now, you know?

Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O,
Wee Man, and them.

He doesn't know that "the plane
is gonna take a little oopsie."

And also, the pilot's gonna jump out
in the middle of it.

So, shit is gonna get
a little bit of real.

Scared of airplanes, scared of heights.

Second time I'm ever on a fuckin' plane,
and I'm finna jump out.

He's flown once before.
And how did that go?

We took this man to Hawaii,
and he cried the whole way there.

Had his eyes closed the whole time.

[Dark Shark] Yeah, I been scared of planes
all my life. I pump myself up.

That was my first time on a plane.


I closed my eyes the whole way.

-Tears in my goddamn eyes.
-[Jasper laughs]

[Dark Shark] Not cryin',
but, uh, tears came out my eyes.

This is Boyd, our pilot.
He's gonna be flying the plane today.

And Boyd, I just beg of you,
just no turbulence, as safe as possible.

Don't upset Dark Shark.

-Nice and smooth.
-Yeah.

-I can do that.
-Thank you.


-[dramatic music playing]
-[onlookers cheer]


[Dark Shark laughs]

â€¦the workin' girls' dream,
the old maids' delight, Dark Shark!

I'mma cry like a bitch.

How'd I get here?

[group cheers]

-How'd I get here? A blessing, though.
-Bring it in. We got this.

-Yeah, Dark Shark. You got it, buddy.
-[Dark Shark] Goddamn.

-You ready?
-Hell no.

-Yeah, Dark Shark.
-[Dark Shark groans]


Yeah.

[ominous music playing]

-[Dark Shark exhales]
-You got this.

-Our pilot is solid as they come.
-[engines whir]

[man 1] Whoo.


How high are we gonna be when we jump?
How many feet?

-Two thousand.
-[man 2] High.

-[Johnny] Thirteen thousand feet.
-[man 3] First for me.

Everyone's wavin' to you, Dark Shark.

[group cheers]


He was in a fear lock on the way up.

He just took both of his elbows
and just pressed them into me and Jasper.

And he justâ€¦ he was somewhere else.

As the plane takes off,
you know, he's already terrified.

He's just, likeâ€¦

[breathing deeply]

He ain't sayin' nothin',
and then Johnny's cracking little jokes.

You got this.

[Dark Shark breathing deeply]


It was real quiet on that plane,
aside for me mouthing off.


I kept telling him, like,
"Oh, 3,100 feet, 4,700 feet."

Just tryin' to get in his head.


It's pretty smooth, though, right? Really.

Why the fuck you get on this damn plane?


I was tryin' to hold back from not going
fuckin' berserk on that plane.

[Dark Shark] Is this on?

[mouthing inaudibly]

[Jasper laughs]

Huh?

Whoa.

Whoa.

Goddamn, now, look at that shit.

Fuck!

And then, as we're all standin',
they have the pilot, um,

start shakin' the plane a little bit.

-Oh! Oh shit!
-Oh Lord!

-What the fuck is that?
-[Johnny] Oh shit!

And then from there, the plane starts
to "smoke" from the smoke machine.

[alarm blaring]

Hey! Look at the floor.

Hey!

Hey, man! What the fuck, bro?

-There's smoke!
-[man 4] Hey!

So, when all the rest
of that shit went down,

I was already scared to the fullest.

So, in my mind,
I'm tellin' myself, "I'm gonna die today."



He's faking to put the smoke out
with a fire extinguisher.

He looks at Dark Shark and saysâ€¦


-[screams] Oh, shit!
-[man 5] That was the pilot.

I gave up on livin'
for the first time in my life.

And I've been shot
in the head, face, neck.

Everything, never gave up,
but I just had enough.

I was just so scared.

-That was the pilot!
-[group shouting]

-[man 6] Let's go. Come on.
-[man 7] Let's go.

[Dark Shark screams]

["Night on Bald Mountain" playing]

[continues screaming]

-Whoo!
-[Dark Shark groaning]

my parachute had almost fallen off.

I didn't know, but I didn't have
my, uh, straps on my shoulders.

And if you look at the footage,
like, my straps on my shoulders

get all the way down to my elbows.

And then I just wiggle them on,
and boom, they hit the parachute.

["Night on Bald Mountain" continues]

[Dark Shark grunts] Oh my God!

I was prayin',
"You fucked. You deserve to die."

You know, in my mind.
So I was just praying, like,

"Just don't go to hell.
I don't wanna go to hell."


[wails, sighs] Oh, God. My heart!

I'm havin' a heart attack!
I can't breathe! Get me down!

Get me down, please. I'm done. I quit.

I'm done!

-[Chris] There's Dark Shark, right there.
-[Poopies] Dark Shark's doin' 360s. Look!

-[Dark Shark crying loudly]
-[assistant] It's all right.


[group cheers]

[Steve-O] You made it!

[Dark Shark groaning]

Oh my God!

[group continues cheering]


[Dark Shark groans]

Pops! You did it, Pops!
You're here now! You're here now!

-[Dark Shark laughs]
-Smile! Smile!

How was it?

-I almost died.
-[Jasper] But you didn't die.

-I did.
-[Jasper] You did not.

You been shot nine times!
That ain't nothin'!

I'd rather get shot nine times again.
You know what I'm sayin'?

-[Jasper] I don't wanna never get shot.
-I almost died. I swear to God.

I was very proud of Dark Shark
for facing his fears.

'Cause even after that,
he just became a different person,

and he was even more positive,
and he's had a better look at life.

Y'know? It really changed him.

[Dark Shark] Remember the deal, though.
You gotta Crip Walk with me.

All right. Now, you show me
how to Crip Walk.

Throw the C's up.

Just move your legs.
Just give me a little of this.

-[Wee Man laughs]
-Now do this.


-Little of that.
-[Jasper] Wipe your toe. Wipe it off too.

Yeah. There you go. Wipe.
There you go.Â There you go.

-[Jasper laughing]
-Damn! Did I do it? Did I do it?

-You did it!Â You did it!
-Yeah!

-Yeah, Dark Shark!
-[Dark Shark] Fuck!

-I think I seen this in a Jackass movie.
-[Irving] You say you saw this in Jackass?

I don't think those guys
are around anymore.

-[men groan]

-[Jeff] All right. You got it, daughter.

[man 1] Yeah.

-[Eric groans]
-[man 2] Holy shit.

[Poopies groans]

Hey, Poopies, what happened
with your thong, man?

Well, I took a poop
before I put the thing on,

and I only wiped twice and shouldaâ€¦
shoulda added that third wipe.

I'm sorry, anyone in this room,

have you ever been in the clear
after two wipes?

I have never been
in the clear after less than 15.

Safety first.

-[groans]
-[group laughs]

-Hey, what the shit?

going down the hill in a pasta strainer.

He's mentally bankrupt.

[group groans]

I'm stronger.

-Spike sucks to fight.
-[Spike] Yeah.

Like, Spike is so surprisingly
hard to deal with in a fight

'cause he's wiry, butâ€¦

-[Spike grunts]
-No, no, no, no! Don't! Don't!

See? I'm stronger!

[all laughing]
