Are you okay?

Miss!

Miss.

Where are you going?

Wherever you can take us.

The usual.

It'd be a pleasure, Miss...

Miss Hannah.

Good to meet you, Miss Hannah.

You should get in the car.

Yeah?

If you want a ride.

Hey, we really appreciate this.

So, do you have a name?

Uh, yeah. Max.

Well, Maxy...

You got a nice car.

You're sweet.

Hey, I think we're ready.

Do you mind if I check my ride?
I don't wanna forget my toothbrush.

Just hurry it up.
I don't wanna roast out here. It's burning.

Dibs.

Bullshit.
Come on. It's my turn.

I reeled him in. He's my fish to fry.

Semantics.

Big word.

Rock, paper, scissors.

What, are we seven?

You have to get used to it
if you want a kid around.

Right?

I win.
I guess you do.

Are you serious about that kid?

Hammer-time serious.

You can light the next one up, babe.

Okay?
Mm-hmm.

Shit. That's a hell
of a long time for a toothbrush.

I needed my floss too.
Yeah?

Well, some say that's more important.

You're gonna have to get in the back, man.
Sorry.

Step out of the car.

Huh?
Step out of the car, Maxy.

What the fuck is this?
Dude.

Don't panic. Happens to the best of us.

And the worst.
And the worst.

Get the fuck out of my car right now.
What the...

Hey, babe?

I was thinking about, like, drugs and that.

Like how people
will classify something a drug...

and stamp it with this negativity.

You know, like weed.

Like, all this negativity
for something so happy.

But then I got to thinking, like...

can't anything be a drug?

You know? Like water. Okay?

Water's a drug. Seriously.

You go cold turkey on water...

your throat swells up, you hallucinate...

get the shakes and, like, die.

That's a worse relapse
than I've seen a heroin junkie get.

Where's the warning label
on a bottle of water? Huh? Huh?

"May get addicted.

Side effects... drowning and dizziness."

What do you think?

Babe.

Hey.

How you doing?

I'm...
Awful.

Dainty. Empathetic.

I'm terrific.

Good.

'Cause you're my drug.

Mrs. Hannah West.

You can't do this, Jake.

I-I'm only doing what you can't.

Don't. I'll talk to him.
I'll make him stop.

Look at you.
Look at you.

You look afraid.
What would I have to be afraid of?

There comes a time in every man's life...
Holy shit. You know what?

I'm gonna pass on the Tumblr life advice.
This guy? He's a real keeper.

Please.
What do you want me to do?

Do something!

Stop him!

No!

If you were smart, you'd leave too.

Hey, you ready?

Yeah?

What?

I-I need my paintbrush.
Paintbrush.

I'll buy you new ones, okay?
Okay.

Michael!

You look like an absolute mess.

What's going on in here?
I-I... I slept too late.

Just in time for <i>Passions,</i> huh?

You okay?
Yeah.

Okay, then. Did you remember to...

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Um...

What?
Nothing.

What's going on in here?
Is there somebody else here?

Whoa! No. Why would you
automatically think that?

You're hiding something.
No.

Just... Just calm down.

I don't get why you're acting so weird.

I'm sorry.

I... I just had a rough day at work today.
We had to let Eric go.

Eric? Come here.

What the hell is...
G-Give me that!

Is this a suicide note?

I can explain.

Don't you think you're overreacting?

No. I-I'm reacting just fine, I-I think.

You think? You just thinkin'
you're gonna kill yourself?

And I don't snore.

<i>â™ª After a hard day of work â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I hit the bar
on my way back home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I saw a young
and pretty poodle â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sittin' at a table all alone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I went up
"Can I buy you a drink?" â™ª</i>

I don't like the way that guy's
looking at me. - Who?

The clerk.

You don't like how anyone looks at you.
Yeah, so stop it.

Repeat after me.
Repeat after me.

I will never look at Hannah again.

I will never look at my wife ever again.
Exact words, asshole!

Or it doesn't count.

I've failed you.

Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. Mm-mmm.

No? Mmm.

There's a motel down the road.

It's an okay place.
That's where the whores usually go.

Not my gas station.

Wow. Aren't you just
the funniest piece of shit.

Twice the size, half the respect.

We expect an apology.

The only thing you should be expecting is
to get blown into bits of fuckin' beef.

There's a lady present.

I know that car!

I know that's not your car...

and I know the man
that would never part with it.

Well, you don't have to be
such a prick about it.

Please, no!

Twenty on two.

You should've killed him.

Yeah, I know.

But it's your turn.

That's the hardest one you've got, Betty?
Come on. Challenge me.

I don't know.

You were doing fine earlier.
Just ask another one. Make it harder.

I hate when you do that.
When I do what?

You ask me to tell a joke,
or tell a story, or ask a question.

I hate the pressure.

Okay, no jokes, stories and questions.

That's not the point.

Give me a second.
Fine.

Anytime now.

Okay. Who was the only person Van Gogh
ever sold a painting to?

Really?

You know I hate him.
You asked.

He can Van Gogh fuck himself.

Uh, can I get the painting name?

<i>Red Vineyard at Arles.</i>

Okay.
Um, can you use it in a sentence?

Uh, was it, uh, Luke?

No.
Right. Just fuck patrons.

Um...

I don't know. I give up.

His brother.

Fuck that.

Dude had less logic than he did ears.

Jon.

I like Hazel.

I like Terry.

Fuck Terry.

Seriously. Terry's a good name.
So is Luke.

No, Luke sounds way too much like "puke."

Babies vomit.

They also piss.

And if it's a girl,
she'll be bleeding soon enough.

I'm just happy to be alone with you.

Then why are you slowing down?

West, why are you slowing down?

I'm not gonna be rude. They look nice.
They can't be going too far.

Do you know what irony is?
I'm not inviting them to search the trunk.

All right?

Hey.

Hi, guys. Thank you for stopping.

No problem. Where y'all headed?

Uh, next town? Anywhere with fuckin'
shade in a box, honestly.

Uh, we don't got a ton of room.

Well, we got, like, no stuff.
Just me, Betty, two packs.

Yeah, man, hop right in. Come on.
It's a hot day. - Thank you.

So, what's your two's deal?

Newlyweds, man.

Whoa. Congrats, man. That's really big.

No, man, amazing is what it is.

Yeah, we formed a band
a few years back, you know.

I was smitten.
She thought I was a lazy asshole.

You know?

But, uh, not much has changed...

except for the whole love thing.

Yeah.

More power to you, man.

All the joy.

How about a game of rock, paper, scissors?

So, what about you guys? What's your deal?

Your partner's quite the talker.
Oh, yeah. Betty.

She's pretty quiet,
but she's the smartest girl I know.

That's what I say, man.
Marry the most interesting chick you know.

She ain't bad on the eyes either.
Yeah.

So happy for you.

Guys, don't mind Hannah.
She's just a little salty I picked you up.

I mean, honestly, if we're imposing...

Dude, quit it. Seriously.

We're pulling into town now. Can't be
any worse off than that guy either.

Oh, fuck!
Dude.

Some broad probably ruined his day too.

Michael.

Michael.

Wake the fuck up.

Michael. Get off the lawn, please.

I wanna come inside.

I know.
I heard you yelling last night.

And you ignored me?

You're damn straight I did.

I can't be taking all this
up and down shit, Michael.

Do you even know what this is doing to me?

Well, call the cops. I don't care.

Very funny.

Here.

What's this for?

You shit in the backyard
last night, Michael.

A-And you called it...

"liberating Liberace."

You love my humor.
Not when it smells like spoiled Brie.

Listen.

I love you, Michael.

I love you too.

Which is why...
Uh, look, I-I'll... pull myself together.

Which is why I...

I don't think this is gonna work out.

You're obviously...

You're obviously
going through something.

Then let's sit down
and talk each other through it.

Help each other out, like good couples do.

I want to, but...

I don't think you're ready for
a relationship right now.

And...

you drink a lot.

I mean, a <i>lot,</i> Michael.

You fucking shit in the backyard!

Okay.

Michael.
I said okay.

Fuck.

What do you mean, there's no gig?

I'm... W-We don't have live music here.

I mean, we got a jukebox. Right there.

This has to be some cruel joke.

The only reason that we are here...

instead of Hawaii
or some bullshit Alaskan cruise...

is the chance to play, right?

Right?

Yeah. Yeah, look.

I mean, I called Cortland.

They said we could
play our music here on the 17th.

That's tomorrow.
Yeah.

I... I mean, this <i>is</i> Cortland Bar.

But there's also, uh, Cortland Liquor,
which is the liquor shop...

and Cortland Thrift,
which is also... it's the thrift shop.

Uh, Cortland High, the high school...

The high school! The high school
is having their talent show.

Tomorrow night.

You booked us...

a fucking high school
talent show?

Babe, I didn't...

A fucking high school talent show...

for our honeymoon.

Are you fucking retarded?

Hannah, I'm sorry.

Okay, look,
we don't have to go. All right?

We can still enjoy all of this. Right?

All of this.

Whatever this is.

Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt, but do you
know a place we can stay for the night?

And you really shouldn't say "retard."
That's not cool.

Uh, we don't really have
hotels around here.

But there is a bed and breakfast
up the mountain a bit.

<i>â™ª Sober night â™ª</i>

Great. Uh, how do we get there?

Looks like we'll be riding with you
a little bit longer.

You guys are really gonna like this place.
It's really, really nice.

So, you're gonna head up this way
about two miles...

you take a left on Shitstain Road.

And at the end is the B and B
just past the lake.

You guys have a road called Shitstain?

Yeah, it doesn't really have a name.

But it's all dirt and it looks like shit,
so... Yeah.

Wonderful.

Let's go get shitty.

Thanks for your help.
Take it easy.

Hey, champ.

All right.

Yeah. Okay.

Turn over.

Why?
Do what I say, you fuckin' slut.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you fucking kidding me?

No fucking way.

No, no, no. Hold on.

Don't you want this?

All right, just...

Fine. Okay.

If I tap your ass, though,
I want it off. Okay?

It's not my ass gettin' tapped.

Shut up.

Wow.

It's huge.

This is perfect.

Right, babe?
Delightful.

Come on. A little nature won't kill us.

Yeah?

We're also not gonna play a show.

So enjoy your fucking bed.

And breakfast.

Doesn't it look kind of
like the Custom House?

What's that?
Monet.

<i>Custom House, Morning Effect.</i>

Hmm. A lot smaller than my house.

Also a lot more on a cliff.

But I do appreciate the comparison.

Hey, how many beds you need?

Uh... two. Two should be good.
Cool.

Possibly a couch.
No problem.

I have room for everybody.

Ah. You must be Rachael.

Yeah. Sorry.
I'm horrible with introductions.

I am Rachael of Rachael's Bed
and Breakfast. - My pleasure.

Ah. You need help with your bags?
No, we're fine.

Okay. Well, uh,
you can check in anytime you want.

Take whatever room on the bottom floor.
I'll be around.

Oh, the room on the right is taken.

Another guest?
Yeah. Long-term.

He doesn't bother anybody.

But if you see a tallish man
lurking around, don't be scared.

Scared.
Mmm.

Hey. What was that?

Miss Little Art History 101
in her high boots. What do you think?

I think you're being uncool.
Yeah?

Well,
I didn't pick Fucksville for a honeymoon.

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

Okay.

This ain't too bad.

Huh?

Shit.

I forgot my toothbrush.

Hey.

You okay?

What are we doing here?

I miss home.

Okay.

Yeah, I mean, I do too.

But...

you know, there's...
there's bigger plans for us now.

Yeah?

I don't know if I can do this.

You can, Betty.

I meant me and you on the road.

Well...

what are you emphasizing?

Me and you?

Or are you emphasizing us... on the road?

Either. Both.

I d... I don't know.

You sh...

Here, why don't you...

Why don't you lie down for a second? Okay?

Let me go see what this place has got
in terms of food.

Hopefully something more
than juice and waffles. Okay?

May I help you?

No. I'm fine.

Hey, we might have gotten off
on the wrong foot earlier today.

But I'm just trying to make sure everybody
has a pleasurable stay.

I'll bet. Any means necessary.

Excuse me?

You look the type to run a brothel,
not a bed and breakfast.

What crawled up your cunt, bitch?

Hey, um...

I'm leading a tour of the woods
in the morning.

And if you wake up and decide to abort
your shitty attitude...

you're welcome to come.

Hey.

Sorry. I-I didn't...
Come here.

What were you doing?

Nothing.

Why were you creeping? It's creepy.

You're really pretty.

You're pretty too.

Do you want to talk?

Or sit?

My mother never brushed my hair.

I thought that was something
moms were supposed to do.

Count to a hundred.

Sing a lullaby.

Put the lotion in the basket. Nice stuff.

I like it. Makes me feel like a cat.

You like animals then?

More than people.

I can understand that.

West is nice.

Yes.

Yes, he is.

Do you... Ow!

Sorry.

Sorry. I'm not used to this.

Aren't there things you want to do
before becoming a mom?

Who said I was becoming a mom?

Sorry.

Theoretically.

You mean, like...

go to Europe?

That.

See museums. Meet new people.

I did a lot of that in school.

You're young. You have time.

Evening, Rachael.
Sorry to bother you so late.

Yeah. Is everything okay?

Y-Yeah...

Well, uh, we've got
a couple kids gone missing.

Anyone I know?

A college girl and a bartender.

Throw in a priest, you got a good joke.

Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't see
that you had friends over.

Patrons, yeah.

Okay, well, they can hear this too.

I'm gonna recommend that you don't go out
alone for a few nights.

We don't know where the kids went.

My money's that the two fools
just ran off together, but...

I'm not sheriff anymore, so...

Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

You know, that's not the only reason
why I came up here.

Are you still doing the Sunday hike?
Yeah. Bright and early.

Well, good. I'll be there.

Okay.
Have a good night.

Good night.

Well, I'll see you all in the morning.

<i>Just cry. It's the natural way.</i>

<i>If you cry, you'll feel good.</i>

<i>If you feel good, you'll
accept who you are.</i>

<i>If you accept who you are,
maybe you won't have to cry anymore, pussy.</i>

<i>And so ends side "A" of</i> Help Me Help You
Stop Hating Yourself.

I'm sorry, babe.

Sorry if I offended some people
this afternoon.

Sorry I'm smoking on your porch.

It's cool.

That works.

So, uh, what do we do now?

What do you mean?

Like...

you know, all the small talk's over.

Chitchat.

What do we do?

We, like, enrich
each other's lives or something.

Oh. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah.

Uh, how do we do that?

Okay, say the first thing
that comes to your head.

Your guitar looks like a cock.

Yeah? Okay.
Mmm.

You go.

Balloons look like boobs.

Okay?

And roses...

look like vaginas.

Vagina!
Yep. Yep.

Yeah!
Yeah.

It's a great word. Right?
It's a <i>great</i> word.

Yeah.
The best, actually.

I...

Cool.

Are you coming on the walk tomorrow?

Yeah.

Count me in.

Cool. Oh...

Looking forward to it.

Night.
Yep.

All right.

Hey, buddy.

Oh!

You're that other guy.

You're the creepy guy.

You okay?

Motherfucker.

Marriage...

shouldn't be...

this fuckin' hard.

The fuck!

What?

Aaah!

Thank you.

Anyone drink coffee?

Hey.

Uh, we're heading out soon, so...

Are you okay?

I'm fine.

Have you seen West?

So you're not fine. Uh, I don't know.

What if he left,
or ran away like those two assholes?

Hey.

West seemed like a really capable guy.

And considering his name, I think he's got
a pretty good sense of direction, so...

Fuck off.

Did you guys get in a fight or something?
Did you hear me, asshole?

Well, I'm just saying.

Look, he probably went
to the bar last night.

You know, it's a long walk back.

Why don't you come with us on the hike?

And we'll probably run into him.

Yeah?

Okay. Fine.

Cool.
Now leave.

Hmm.

Want some jerky?

I'm not gonna say no.

I don't touch the stuff myself.

But I always have extra.

Hey, Michael?

This isn't my first hike, but...
Yeah, I know.

It's my first.

Yeah. You okay?

Or are you trying to lose the Twinkie puff?

You insulting the law, girl?
No. Never.

I'm just saying, I'm a pretty good
seamstress if you need some new clothes.

Duly noted.

So, how long have you
and West been together?

We started fucking in high school.

Found a common interest. It stuck.

So, that's romantic then.

You don't need romance when you have music.

What kind of band you in?

We're called The Royal Cunts.

So, what about you and Betty?

Not that I care.

Uh, we've known each other
since we were kids.

One day it was a kiss, and then...

Yeah, she's licking your asshole.

Is she all right?

Uh, yeah. I think
the flu's going around or something.

The flu. Right.

Hope it wasn't my cooking.

I'm fine, really.

We made it to the lake.
Let's eat lunch here.

I-I picked it up, Davie. I did.

This doesn't feel right.

We had a home.

Baby, that wasn't a home.

Hey. Now, who's been looking out for you?

You.
Yeah.

Damn straight.

Hey.

We're gonna be okay.

We are.

Just gonna be me, you and our kid.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Yeah.

Hey.

I'll be right back, okay?
Where you going?

I'm just gonna try to find
somewhere around here to take a piss.

I'm being active, Davie.
I'm on a hike right now.

I'll do whatever it takes.

Proactive?

Yeah, I'm doing that too.
I'm drinking less. - Hey.

Whoa!

I didn't mean anything.
Nothing.

Just somebody else on the trail.
Have you seen Hannah?

Well, I realize I need to change.

No, I don't want to change you.

Oh, shit.

I just dropped my lunch.

About time.

I was beginning to get wor...

<i>â™ª A ve Maria â™ª</i>

Hey, you. What the fuck?
Run, you asshole.

What the fuck, Hannah? Who the fuck
did this? - Just... fucking... run!

Hey! Help! Somebody, help us!

No, we gotta get this out first.
Okay? Okay?

Do it.

Do it!

Who the fuck did this?

How long?
Hmm?

How long have you been pregnant?

I don't know what you're talking about.

Uh-huh.

You're pretty talented.

What's a young girl like you
doing out of school?

Long story.
Yeah, I bet.

How old are you?

Oh. Never mind.

Help me. Help me!
Rachael? What happened?

I found Jake.
Where?

Dead.
Which direction?

There.
You stay here with Betty. I'm gonna go...

No! I think it's Hannah.

Don't be ridiculous.

Stay right there!
It's her! Shoot her!

She's literally holding a bloody weapon.

Bitch, I got a hole
in my leg because of you!

What the fuck is going on?

All I see is a murderer
and a man with a gun!

Logic dictates... - Logic dictates
you shut your whore-mongering mouth!

Calm down.
That bitch killed this girl's brother.

They aren't brother and sister.

They look just alike.
Who gives a fuck!

Just shoot her!

Hey, you're not brother and sister,
are you?

Shit. Look...

Ugh. You look pathetic.

It's easier than doing it myself.

Go!

No.

Shh.

Okay.

<i>Mommy, I'm hungry.</i>

I ha-have to get that gun.

You're too hurt.

You can do this.

Hannah.

Hannah?

Hannah.

Mommy.

Oh, God.

Ow.

<i>Uh, got them pair of pants you sewed me.</i>

<i>I love 'em.</i>

<i>Thank you kindly.</i>

<i>You know, I was thinking, uh...</i>

<i>that maybe we could go to the lake today.</i>

<i>Catch some fish.</i>

<i>Have a mini tryst.</i>

<i>It'll be so great for our boy
to see all this footage.</i>

<i>What do you say?</i>

<i>I want an abortion.</i>

<i>We have plenty of money.
We're married. I'm ready.</i>

<i>We never talked about it.</i>

<i>- You didn't ask me if I was ready.
Okay, let's talk.</i>

<i>My son's notgonna see
his father doing this.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>- It's not your choice.
I said no.</i>

<i>So just shut up, and we'll go fishing.</i>

<i>- It's not...
Shut up!</i>

<i>- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
You're scaring me.</i>

<i>You threaten the life of my son,
you fucking bitch!</i>

<i>I will. I swear to God,
I will fucking do it.</i>

<i>- Rae. You threaten my legacy, I swear to
God... - I'll cut it the fuck out!</i>

<i>- Put the fuckin' knife down!
Get away from me!</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>I don't want...</i>

<i>- Jesus!
Get it in your fuckin' mouth.</i>

<i>Fuckin' hear me?</i>

<i>It's not so bad.</i>

<i>- Go to fuckin' God.
No.</i>

<i>- Blow your fuckin' brains out.
No.</i>

<i>- Oh, no.
Spread your fuckin' legs.</i>

<i>Ray!</i>

<i>Shut up.</i>

<i>Ow!</i>

<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>- His name is Al.
Ray.</i>

<i>I want a divorce.</i>

Hey.

How you feelin'?

You look good.

Healthy.

Did you know...

that a female body
can sustain a pregnancy...

as young as five years old in some cases?

I got pregnant late by those standards.

But you...
Um...

you look healthy.

Jake's the father, right? Your brother?

Yeah.

Don't look at me that way.

We both porked the guy, one way or another.

Don't worry. I didn't eat him.

I never acquired the taste.

Yeah. I guess it'd be
so much easier if I did.

You're a shy one.

Have you never seen
a naked woman's body before?

Your brother's little prick is probably the only
thing you've ever seen of the natural world.

Yeah? Yeah, you probably closed your eyes.

You didn't want to see it, did ya?

Calm down!

It is just one mother talking to another.

Honey.

We understand each other.

We're a lot alike.

You're sweet.

We have a lot in common.

You didn't love your brother,
did you? No. No.

I could tell. That's good.

I loved my husband.

I loved him.

But he was a mean man with nasty habits.

And I could not kill Al after that.

It's a shame he had to take after his dad.
Huh.

Quickly learned breastfeeding
wasn't an option.

You're crazy.

At least I didn't fuck my brother.

Wait.

Please don't kill me.

Please. Please.

I am not going to kill you.

I'm going to raise your child.

Al needs somebody to bear this burden with.

Al needs a brother. Or a lover.

Like hell!

Very much like hell.

And back again!

No one fucks with a Royal Cunt.

You okay?

You take care of the rest.

Shouldn't you shoot her again,
or something?

You little devil.
I've got something better in mind.

You just finish those ties.

Aaah!

Hannah.

Hannah?

Ha... Hannah?

You stupid fucking girl.

You die now.

You thought you were special.

Thought you could be loved?

You're just a whore.

Just a dead fucking whore.

I prefer the "C" word.

It's so good to have you
drawing again, sweetie.

Your brother...
I'm keeping the baby.

No, of course.

I'm naming her Hannah.

That's lovely, um...

We really should talk about what happened.

No time, Mom. I'm gonna be late for school.

She ate the kid.
No. The kid ate the mom.

Or the mom was eating people... I
don't care. It was 15 years ago.

Dot. Dot.
Everything's going to shit.

Well, just go play with Nicole.

Your sister's fuckin' weird.
Yeah.

They ever find the kid?

Who knows? I don't care.

That's awful.

Excuse me for having a sense of history.

That doesn't even make sense.

Mommy?
