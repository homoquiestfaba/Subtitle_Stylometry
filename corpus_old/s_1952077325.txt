Everyone has something, honey.

And mine is called diabetes. 
So you always have sugar in you. 

15 
Take your cake yet? 

16 
Not tonight, Mon.

I kidding. 
Of course, I take a piece of cake. 

18 
You. 

19 
I meant now, Mom. 
Get the cake on. 

20 
Well. 

21 
You started it and now remains 
in my head, haunting. 

22 
I do not get out. 
Pie. There he is. 

23 
It helps me to forget. 
And you know ... 

24 
Not always but sometimes you need a 
child to respond, and simply say, "Come and '. 

25 
Children do not talk like that. 
Some do. The older. Okay? 

26 
I hear them in the mall. 

27 
Peanut butter ... 

28 
It fills the cracks in my heart. 

29 
Get out of pain. 

30 
What? 

31 
Pauly. 
Come on, Mom. I am not ready. 

32 
Dad. 
Please. 

33 
We do not want you 
a holiday alone. 

34 
But I am not alone. 
I have two of you anyway. 

35 
Black Friday is coming, 
so my dance card is full of will best. 

36 
What? It is the 
busiest day of the year. 

37 
I should not explain 
to citizens. 

38 
I wish I had a colleague here. Hey Tyler, 
you know that black Friday comes back? 

39 
That you do not tell me, 
why do you think I hawk eyes rondloop? 

40 
We are prepared. 

41 
Dad, what has that got to do 
that the rest of your life will be happy? 

42 
You said and I quote: "If I do not 
girlfriend voted for November, 

43 
you may register me 
by Perfect Match. com. 

44 
That was last year. 

45 
Ok. 

46 
Here. 
Okay, what are you looking for in a woman? 

47 
Well, your mother had something special. 

48 
Yes, it was illegal. 

49 
She married you, when was 
they are here legally, and when they left us. 

50 
That is not entirely true. 

51 
We also had good times, 
me when they tried to spawn. 

52 
Well, I hate her. 
That you would not have to do. 

53 
Through her I have you. 

54 
I'm pretty awesome. 
That's right. 

55 
Okay, next question. 
Tell me about yourself. 

56 
Just think. I know a lot about sharks. 
Can I interrupt you immediately. 

57 
Well ... game and a great knuffelaar. 
Great, Grandma. 

58 
But not so great as this. 

59 
What are you doing now? Pimp your profile, with that nice 
video you a few years ago have made. 

60 
Mom, please. 

61 
I do not know. 
Is not it a bit: Hey check me out. 

62 
That is exactly what we want. 
That is the price for it. 

63 
And you do not worry, 
I will edit out the sweaty parts. 

64 
Dear God. 

65 
Get away from the vehicle. 

66 
Dear God, please. 

67 
Go away. 

68 
Do you know where the men are? 
I know.

That is my report on 
how the traffic problem ... 

78 
to tackle 
at Macy's and gift shops. 

79 
How do you do? 
It is for us all. 

80 
If the customers can 
bypass road to the eetkraampjes ... 

81 
prevents chaos 
and frustration among customers. 

82 
It is the classic example 
of "two birds with one stone". 

83 
Can I ask you something? 
Question tap. 

84 
Why can not you just inklokken, quiet 
uitklokken and again, like we all do?

This is the winner. 

169

207 
I'm still fat, just as yours 
Stranded. 

208 
Be honest, we eat our problems.

210 
Plus you get a better skin. 

211

255 
And most people think, 
that their service and issues ...

it stems from Abe and Louis, 
but that is not true. 

257 
It is a bar in itself. 

258 
You know a lot of details, Paul. 

259 
Blart, I heard your ass was beaten 
by a thick chick in Victoria Secret. 

260 
Well, I save no women, so ... 
Is only MPV's, huh?

Everyone on the ground. 

397 
Take the mobile units,

398 
Lie down. 

399

400 
Surprised? 
I know. 

401 
But here's the craziest part ... 

402 
I am the leader. 

403 
We've heard from them in the bank, 
and they have hostages. 

404 
Here agent Howard, I have four units

405 
See if you can see something and take

406 
Get those people away, and we look 
or go through the loading bay arrive. Go. 

407 
Ok. 

408 
Hello? 
Feeling good? 

409 
Sorry? 

410 
Parissa. Through her you feel 
you good. Or not? 

411 
This should be Pahud. 

412 
No, I'm not with Parissa. 
My name is Paul Blart. 

413 
Parissa's father, has her hair 
Mobile declined and lent to me. 

414 
Don 't lie to me, Paul Blart. 

415 
Don 't lie to me. You will either above 
it is the sweating. 

416 
I lie not. I sweat very much, 
but not on someone. 

417 
That woman is a goddess, who just 
good things in this world brings. 

418 
And she also 
a few crazy sexy feet. 

419 
Paul ... 

420 
I can break the pain of our not. 

421 
Nobody can blame you 
that you are upset. 

422 
The holidays have been difficult enough, 
without a broken heart. 

423 
Well these are hard words, Paul Blart. 

424 
Hey, life is hard. 
Yes. 

425 
So you are in the mall. 

426 
Why not go to Orange Julias. 
Call my friend Samir O. .. 

427 
tell him that you are my friend, 
and he arranges something for you. 

428 
Wait a minute, how do you know 
I'm in the mall? 

429 
I check Parissa via GPS. 
Assessment is not about me.

Is it closing? 

431 
There are 223 shops in this mall. 

432 
Here is a list of the fifteen stores 
I want you holding. 

433 
Fifteen for you. 

434 
Ok. 

435 
This is the key to the codes given 
of the ATMs in the shops. 

436 
They change every day, so make sure 
you tell me the codes today bring. 

437 
Veck, a zesmans standard formation 
as you said. 

438 
Perfect. 

439 
Back, back. 

440 
And the pigs ran quickly home. 

441 
Do it! 

442 
Gary gives normal scrap 
to the Salvation Army. 

443 
Hello all, I have a few requests ... 

444 
Bind the person next to you. 
Keep your mouth shut. Enter your phone off ... 

445 
and, as a general rule: do what I say. 

446 
If you do all these things, you 
so back home. Back at your pathetic life. 

447 
I have none. 
Amy ... 

448 
I hoped that we have a kind 
Bonnie and Clyde affair could have. 

449 
Without die 
a sea of bullets, of course. 

450 
What do you think? 
Fuck. 

451 
Hey Stu, you'll find it not 
I your girlfriend very hard fall? 

452 
What? No. She is not my girlfriend. 

453 
But ... I heard you say that 
you almost had something together. 

454 
I did not say that we had. 
I said that ... 

455 
of learning took. 

456 
Nothing more. 

457 
My God, what are you a loser. 

458 
Hello? 

459 
Agent with Howard, the 
West Orange police station. Who is this? 

460 
Hello. It goes like this ... 

461 
As you have learned all unteachable, 
I have a sensor on each door are ... 

462 
so if you want to enter my shopping, 
but please direct ... 

463 
at least six body bags along. 

464 
They are in the safe open 
to drilling, and they can see us. 

465 
Make sure to go through security cameras 
what to see. 

466 
Listen, no one will try 
to enter the mall. 

467 
Do what you need? 
Do you have food or water? 

468 
Man, this guy is not good 
in his head. 

469 
Now you do ask, I would 
like to have a happy meal. 

470 
Ensure that the toy is the sea monster, 
because I already have the dragon 

471 
Okay, what do you really have? 

472 
Silence. 

473 
Sorry, but the mall is closed. 

474 
I can do to bring the output, 
if you say me where you parked. 

475 
Dear God. 

476 
This does not happen. 

477 
Oh, God ... 

478 
Well. Think, Paul. 
Where have you trained. 

479 
Nothing. 

480 
Act fast. 
I must pass. 

481 
I give it. 

482 
We have an unexpected visitor. 

483 
A guard. 
What are we doing? 

484 
I do not know. 
Specifying I think. 

485 
Guys, what is wrong with you. 
We are in the plan. 

486 
We have an operator of 911 
connected to one Paul Blart. 

487 
He is a guard at the mall. 
Blart is one of my men. 

488 
<i> Paul, with Howard of agent 
West Orange police ...</ i> 

489 
the mall is busy, 
and they have hostages. 

490 
I want you to immediately leave the building. 

491 
<i> we can in this situation 
no heroes use. </ i> 

492 
Roger, I was never a hero. 

493 
Whether you need the game 
Uno find heroic. 

494 
Blart, you can even continue with the lesson? 
Yes, sir. I'm on the way out. 

495 
Come on, not die. 
Not dying. 

496 
Blart. 

497 
Not pee. 

498 
The motion was 
just out of door 26. Everyone pointed out. 

499 
Amy. 
What is he doing? Come on. 

500 
Blart, come on. 
Blart, come on! 

501 
What is he doing? 
Come on, Blart! 

502 
Come on! 

503 
Is he crying? 
I can not leave. 

504 
Blart! 
Where does he go? 

505 
Blart come back. 
Can you talk to him, please. 

506 
Blart, this is Brooks, 
what is wrong? 

507 
Sir, I have sworn to this mall 
to protect at all times. 

508 
We have no oath. 

509 
That I have made. 
On a poster in my room. 

510 
Listen ... 

511 
I think you commit a big mistake. 
The ME is on. 

512 
And I think when I say that you do not 
are trained, unarmed ... 

513 
and let's be honest, 
you're a big target. 

514 
With all due respect, sir. 
But I can not do from outside. Out. 

515 
Well officer, it seems 
that you have in mind. 

516 
Amy, Paul Blart here, you still 
always in the mall. 

517 
Send. 

518 
I see him. 

519 
Come on, think. 
Think. 

520 
Think! 

521 
Pick your meeting. 

522 
Heart of a warrior. 

523 
I missed lunch. 

524 
Thank you. 

525 
Hey, do not 
harder than it already is. 

526 
How about that? 

527 
Brooks, I got the girl, 
but boy escapes me. 

528 
So, Paul, you have one. 
Yes. 

529 
For clarity, 
I have not beaten woman. 

530 
I have my whole 
weight in the sea. 

531 
Jesus. 
She is fine. 

532 
Well, let's you then get out. 

533 
That will not work, sir. 
I started off where I am. 

534 
What is this? 
Give me that thing. 

535 
Paul, agent with Howard again. 

536 
<i> If you still refuse to get out ...</ i> 

537 
<i> go to the bank again, 
to see where the hostages they hold. </ i> 

538 
With pleasure, sir. 

539 
Good to know. 

540 
I have not heard of Don or Vixen. 
Okay. 

541 
I urge everyone, and I want this shopping center 
from the inside have completed. 

542 
Immediately! 

543 
Why do not we shoot a few 
hostages down, that will make them stop. 

544 
That is one way. But the hostages 
are the only thing that keeps the outside polite. 

545 
I am Commander Kent. My team is talking about, 
I would have surrounded this place. 

546 
We have ... - Set the environment safe 
and get all those people out of here. 

547 
This is all done. 
My men will do it again. 

548 
The right way. 
Let your men retreat. 

549 
Are there requirements? 
A Happy Meal, and absolute silence. 

550 
Let's make some noise. I hebluipschutters 
ready. Is the communication ready? 

551 
At the security inwards 
I want to have image inside. 

552 
That does not, they have destroyed the cameras. 
We take in ... 

553 
.. three ... two ... one. 
I have the leadership. 

554 
Brooks, I observe the bank now. 

555 
One robber guarded the hostages. 

556 
There she is. 

557 
My God. 
You are my angel. 

558 
Here comes the sweat of love. 
Paul, your radio is still open. 

559 
Understood. 
What is wrong? 

560 
Who is that? 
We have someone in there. 

561 
Certainly some disapproved agent, 
that the hero wants to hang out. 

562 
No, his name is Blart. 
He is one of my guards. 

563 
Wait, Blart? Paul Blart? 
Yes. 

564 
You make a joke. I schold that loser 
always used at school. Enter here. 

565 
Blart, this is Commander James Kent, 
mobile unit of New Jersey. 

566 
We went to the same secondary school. 
Remember? 

567 
I got you lit during 
the pancake festival. 

568 
Right, hi Jimmy. 
Come on, Green Hornes. 

569 
Listen, I have fifty good 
professionals trained outside ... 

570 
on my character, we take over. 
And I do not admit that this mission goes wrong ... 

571 
because sul previously went to lunch 
with an imaginary friend, this verprutst. 

572 
Sorry Jimmy, I had the button, 
the only thing I heard was lunch and friend. 

573 
Wil you do me a favor, 
Brooks give me back. 

574 
Listen Blart, you is not communicating 
longer brooks, is that clear? 

575 
Hello? 

576 
Hello? 
Yes? 

577 
Hi Paul, how are you? 

578 
It turns out that the hostages 
brought to the counting room. I go closer. 

579 
Veck. 

580 
There he is. 

581 
Everybody to the back. 
Now! Come on. 

582 
Brooks, I have seen the hostages. 

583 
I could not escape. 
But I know who the leader is. 

584 
It is Veck. 
Veck? The student? 

585 
No, the brain. 
Do not believe it. 

586 
I give it to Howard. 

587 
Oh, God. 
Caught. I think it best. 

588 
<i> We start tanning. 
Three ... two ... one. </ I> 

589 
Yes! 

590 
Cypher is in the hunt. 

591 
Open, open. 
Open. 

592 
Thank God. 

593 
Oh, no. 

594 
Mr. ... 

595 
Get him. 
Get him! 

596 
You can also better flights. 

597 
Rudolph where are you? 
I'm an end to it. 

598 
Amy, right? What a coincidence. 

599 
We have a pretty redhead in the bank 
which is called Amy. - Strawberry Blonde, actually. 

600 
I know whom I will first kill. 

601 
See you later. 

602 
I think you 
no more shopping. 

603 
It will soon be over. 
They will feel nothing. 

604 
You will not touch. 
But this you will feel. 

605 
Nobody wins with a headbutt. 

606 
Give me your cellphone. 
I have none. 

607 
Each child has a mobile. 
I prefer written notes. 

608 
Who are these Slopy Joey's, 
and who has given you? 

609 
They are mine. 

610 
I'm late for my 
work at Foot Locker. 

611 
We have contact with him, 
he wants to talk to you. 

612 
Silence, my ass. 

613 
What is it, I hit you too hard? 
Go now in the corner sucking your thumb? 

614 
If you're not interfering with that bastard, 
He will you spend the whole evening continue glands. 

615 
Is that so? 
That is not my style. 

616 
For the case. 
I have a few nice phrases written. 

617 
Like this one. 
Have you been here all the time doing? 

618 
Yes, you and what army? 

619 
What is wrong with that? 
He has an army. 

620 
Everyone deserves a pass, 
his birthday. 

621 
When you and Rudolph home in this laugh 
were, how easy it all would be ... 

622 
you had something of every brain dead 
guard who stands in the way is slain. 

623 
And when you were a High Five? 

624 
Veck, this guy is ... 
To win. I know ... 

625 
because I am totally ready. 
With pathetic pleasure, I have no codes. 

626 
Since I have all the luxury goods 
Amizone purchased with my card ... 

627 
The situation is unacceptable! 

628 
No, no, no. He looks. 

629 
Give me your gun. 

630 
Put it down. 
Leg ... 

631 
What are you to whisper? 

632 
I was wondering if you seriously 
believed that "Happy Meal"? 

633 
It is certainly not. 

634 
What? 

635 
This is Inspector James Kent, New Jersey 
Special Assistance Unit. Did you speak to me? 

636 
I wanted only certain 
that no one stupid part. 

637 
You should know that my men 
determination to resolve the situation. 

638 
The easy way 
or the hard way. 

639 
That is a tough decision. 

640 
I answer C, 
neither. 

641 
I am also Amy. 
Amy? From UnbeWEHvable? 

642 
Yes. 

643 
I am Maya. 
My father made it all the time you 

644 
And I must say that you really should. 
I must give. 

645 
That is so bad. 

646 
Paul, your daughter is here ... Amy 
Oh, my God. 

647 
He has his daughter. 

648 
Dad? 

649 
Everything will be okay. 
How is your blood sugar? 

650 
Do not worry about me. 
I am concerned about you. 

651 
At this time you get it all out. 
Hold persevere, dear. 

652 
I do. I am a Blart, remember? 
Yes. See you soon.

If you hostage in my shopping takes

666 
You underestimated me seriously.

679 
Yes, you heard me, Chief! 
All right, Dad! 

680 
Hey, guys! 

681 
You were looking for me? 

682 
Come on. 

683 
Follow me ... 
There he is! 

684 
We have him in the fall at Rain Forrest Cafe. 
Great, waiting for me. 

685 
You know what my mother always said? 
If you want something good to be done,

Prancer, take the rear. 

688 
Hey, you! 
Scoobie doebie do! 

689 
Can I get my codes? 
Why? 

690 
No codes, no Cayman Islands? 

691 
It seems that Paul Blart 
all is not so bad. 

692 
Relax. 

693 
Oh, no! 

694 
All I know is that Paul Blart 
all is not so bad. 

695 
Find him. 
Do not come back earlier than that he is dead. 

696 
Brooks, another one to go. 
Then there is only me and Veck left. 

697 
Ok! Who talks with Blart? 

698 
Were you the sweet tooth? 

699 
Well, let's try again. 
Wait, no, no! 

700 
It is her phone, she is. 
They talked to him. 

701 
They talked with him and I 
her not to do so. 

702 
And it is under her leg ... the phone. 
Her right leg. There. 

703 
Ok. 

704 
That was at the last minute. 
He is a Professor 

705 
Listen, Blart. The time is over. 
We storms inside. 

706 
Wait. 
Veck to the credit card codes and I got them. 

707 
Give me a couple minutes. 
No problem. 

708 
Is not that cute? 

709 
Hi, Amy. I'm on my way ... 
Hi, Blart. 

710 
Our boy Stuart showed me your profile 
monitor Lone suckers. com? 

711 
He likes the morning rain, 
Walking on the beach. 

712 
Who are you? Olivia Newton John? 
I just speak from my heart. 

713 
I do not go online 
to know that you keep peanut butter. 

714 
You're so pathetic. 

715 
Strange ... 

716 
I can use. 

717 
What do you Veck? 

718 
Thirty one million which I have come, 
but I would offer you your dream girl or ... 

719 
perhaps your daughter. 

720 
If you touch her, I swear that I'll get. 
What do you do, Paul? 

721 
Your left hip forward lift, the 
illusion that they should have a gun, 

722 
which you and I know 
that you do not have? 

723 
My God. 
You go to ball. 

724 
The next time I see you, Paul, 
I shoot a bullet in your head. 

725 
I thought not. 
I take you to graze. 

726 
Blart! 

727 
Oh, Blart ... 

728 
My dear God ... 

729 
I wish I had a bag, I would cut 
to see how much candy would fall out. 

730 
This does not happen ... this does not happen. 

731 
Bravo! 
This was great. 

732 
And you were so close to 
the display to get Paul. 

733 
So close. 
It is not over. 

734 
Yes, I thought so. 
The only thing I need is my codes. 

735 
Seen your SMS messages, you are so sweet 
been for me in your phone system. 

736 
Do you think my phone 
with me have the ... 

737 
Hello? 

738 
You are not Blart and jelly. 
What about it? So good to hear your voice. 

739 
Good to also hear your voice, Pahud. 
Listen, I call you back. 

740 
What? When? 
I do not know when. Talk to you later. 

741 
All right, Paul. Call me back. 
Call me back Paul ... 

742 
It is always better and more beautiful. 

743 
You are impossible to estimate. 

744 
You did not for the police exam ... 

745 
You can if you do not pass any 
20 minutes to eat a Snickers. 

746 
You had the chance to N.V.P. be 
and you blow it. 

747 
Again, like you always do. 
Is that correct, Maya? 

748 
You know, Veck. 
You're smarter as I do. 

749 
You are good with computers ... 

750 
You keep your weight level. 

751 
People look at you and me 
and it is a big difference. 

752 
No contest. 

753 
And now you're the man with the gun. 

754 
Please. 

755 
Get him! 
Get him, Dad. 

756 
I had more to catch. 

757 
Dad! 

758 
By Laden, guys. 
We go inside. 

759 
We are on the way. 
Let's go.

Come on, come on, come on. 

761 
Think, Paul! 
Think! 

762 
Let's go, men! 
Let them put their number. 

763 
Take the suspect caught. 

764 
Do not shoot! 

765 
Down. 
No, other. 

766 
This is the rear! 
No, that is the same. 

767 
No! The other! 
Veck is gone and my daughter Amy. 

768 
All, wipe clean the mall. 
We are in pursuit. 

769 
Lamp. 

770 
Make the door open. 

771
