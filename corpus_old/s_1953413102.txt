ALL RIGHT NOW GENTLEMAN, BRING
ME UP TO SPEED ON YOUR MEETING

WITH HALLSWELL'S
PEOPLE THIS MORNING.

SENATOR, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
MOVE FAST TO GATHER THE SUPPORT

WE NEED.

SENATOR HALLSWELL IS DETERMINED
TO REIGN ALL THOSE REGIONS IN

THE MIDEAST.

IF WE'VE LEARNED ANYTHING IN THE
PAST 50 YEARS, IT IS THAT EVERY

GUN, LOCKET AND TANK WE SELL
WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED AGAINST

US.

SCREW HALLSWELL.

WE HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO GET BY
HIM AND THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS

BEEN MAKING CALLS.

THAT IS WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

SON, YOU FORGOT MY GLASS.

EXCUSE ME.

LISTEN RICHARD, YOU CAN THINK
WHATEVER YOU WANT OF THIS GUY.

BUT JUST REMEMBER HE'S GOT A
LOT OF FRIENDS IN THIS TOWN.

YEAH, AND MOST OF
THEM DEMOCRATS.

THAT'S FUNNY.

DID YOU HEAR THEY'RE MAKING A
MOVIE ABOUT DAN QUAIL'S MILITARY

CAREER?

IT'S CALLED FULL DINNER JACKET.

SENATOR?

JUST A HOT FLASH.

ARE YOU OKAY?

SENATOR!

JESUS HE IS HAVING A SEIZURE.

CALL THE PARAMEDICS!

I KNOW CPR.

AMAZING, IT IS
EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED.

AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT ALRED.

 WELL, FOR THE DOG DAYS,
IT'S ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY

IN THE CAPITAL CITY.

IT'S HOT.

AND WE'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED
THAT POLICE HAVE COMPLETELY SHUT

DOWN ALL LANES ON THE WHITEHURST
FREEWAY BETWEEN PENNSYLVANIA AND

THE 3RD STREET EXIT.

WE ARE TOLD THAT IT IS
SOME SORT OF BOMB SCARE.

EMERGENCY VEHICLES ARE ON THE
SCENE AND AS YOU MAY IMAGINE,

TRAFFIC IS ALREADY BACKED
UP ALL THE WAY TO VIRGINIA.

THIS IS WNLC AND I'M
TERRY IN THE MORNING.

WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED FOR
ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS.

AM I GOING TO?

DIE?

YES.

I MEAN TODAY.

WE'VE GOT ONE ECCENTRIC HUSBAND.

DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?

HAVE ONE LITTLE AFFAIR..

AND THIS IS WHAT HE DOES.

HOW DOES IT LOOK?

YOUR HUSBAND CERTAINLY
KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

WHICH COLOR DO YOU PREFER?

RED OR GREEN?

RED.

TOO LATE IT'S GREEN.

OH GOD...

GIMME YOUR GUM QUICK.

A FED WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING?

I WAS HOPING.

WHAT'S THAT?

YOU EVER SEEN THIS?

WHAT'S THIS YOUR LUCKY CHARM?

NO...

I JUST LIKE TAPING
PICTURES TO MY CHEST.

ARE YOU DANNY O'NEIL?

THAT'S RIGHT, WHY?

DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING TO
DO WITH THE EDWARDS MCMAHON

SWEEPSTAKES OR SOMETHING?

IT'S A RESTRAINING ORDER TO
KEEP YOU AWAY FROM YOUR WIFE.

HAVE A NICE DAY.

THIS IS A SECURED AREA.

NO ONE!

NO ONE IS ALLOWED IN HERE.

SORRY ABOUT THIS DAN.

THERE WAS A DETONATION AT
A RESTAURANT ON DELAWARE.

THEY SENT IN A COPTER FOR YOU.

OH MAN, LOVE MONDAYS.

THE TRACKS, OVER.

BONE.

HAVE FUN IN THERE DANNY.

FIDELITY
INSURANCE STRIKES AGAIN.

WELL DANNY O'NEILL.

YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE
PAYING OUT BIG TIME ON THIS ONE.

TELL ME ABOUT IT.

FOUR DEATHS AND 15 INJURIES.

MAYBE IS WAS A GAS LEAK?

WELL IF IT WAS A GAS LEAK,
SOMEBODY HAS SERIOUS GAS

PROBLEMS.

DID YOU REALLY TRY AND THROW
TRAVERES OFF THE BALCONY AT YOUR

HOUSE.

I COULDN'T GET HIS
FAT ASS OVER THE RAIL.

I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW
SORRY I AM ABOUT YOU AND YOUR

WIFE.

HOW COME EVERYBODY
KNOWS ABOUT THIS?

I MEAN WAS THIS ON
CNN OR SOMETHING?

I KNOW EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON
IN THIS TOWN DANNY, YOU KNOW

THAT.

REALLY?

WHAT ABOUT SENATOR WILKINS?

THE PINK PANTIES IN THE DESK.

SEE YA.

YOU'RE BAD.

SHANE!

WILL YOU GET THIS HORNY
CAN OF TUNA AWAY FROM ME?

WHAT CAN I SAY DAN?

MADONNA WANTS YOU.

GO!

I'M NOT DOING IT DAN, I SWEAR.

I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE
REACTS TO YOU THAT WAY?

WELL YOU MUST NOT BE
TREATING HER RIGHT.

PICK YOURSELF UP A CAN OF
WD40 AND GO TO TOWN WITH IT.

JAMES IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

WHERE IS HE?

RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

JAMES, JAMES.

TERRORIST ATTACK
IT LOOKS LIKE HUH?

WHERE'S THE DEVICE?

CAN'T FIND IT.

EXCUSE ME?

THEY SAY THAT SENATOR VICTOR
HAD A SEIZURE AND THEN BOOM.

BOOM?

YOU MEAN HE
SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTED?

YOU TELL ME.

OKAY WHAT DO YOU KNOW GUYS?

NOTHING.

NO METAL, PLASTIC
OR CHEMICAL RESIDUE.

C'MON WHAT IS THIS GUYS YOUR
FIRST DAY ON THE JOB, KEEP

DIGGING.

PEOPLE DON'T JUST EXPLODE.

I MEAN IF THEY DID, I WOULD HAVE
HEARD ABOUT IT A LONG TIME AGO.

WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

JESUS.

SHANE, LOOK AT THIS.

LOOKS LIKE THE FINGERS
HAVE BEEN BLOWN RIGHT OFF.

EITHER THAT OR HE
SHOULD FIRE IS MANICURIST.

TERRY, WHAT I'M SAYING
IS THAT I SUPPORT YOU.

I JUST WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

AND WITH DAN, UNTIL
RECENTLY YOU WERE SO UNHAPPY.

THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

I KNOW.

I THINK SENATOR

MY GARBAGE PAIL.

DANNY, I'VE BEEN THOUGH THIS TOO
MANY TIMES BEFORE AND I'M SICK

OF GETTING HURT.

I'M ALWAYS THE
ONE WHO GETS HURT.

LISTEN, HOW ABOUT THE ONE
THAT IS SEEING OTHER PEOPLE?

FRANK TRAVERES IS NOT
THE PROBLEM WITH US.

I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN
WASHINGTON, D.C WOULD DISAGREE

WITH THAT.

MOM, COULD YOU DO SOMETHING?

THANKS MOM.

FRANK AND I WORK TOGETHER.

WE GOT TO BE FRIENDS.

I CAN'T LIVE WITH YOU ANYMORE.

NOT SINCE...

GIVE YOU A CHECK RIGHT NOW.

DO YOU HAVE A PEN?

YES, OF COURSE, THANK YOU.

I'LL BE OUT OF YOUR WAY SOON.

YES!

THAT FOOL WAS RIGHT, IT IS
COMPLETELY UNDETECTABLE.

WITH THE POWER THIS FORMULA CAN
GIVE US, NOTHING WILL STAND IN

OUR WAY, NOTHING.

SOMETIMES I WONDER.

WHAT IS IT ALL FOR?

REALLY?

NO...

HMMM...

AND WE'LL SET THE PRESS
CONFERENCE FOR FIRST THING

TOMORROW MORNING.

YEAH, I WANT SOMETHING PREPARED.

SOMETHING UM,
SOMETHING EMOTIONAL.

SENATOR VICTOR WAS A FRIEND.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED.

REMEMBER EMOTION, FEELING.

YEAH.

I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
JUST HOW SERIOUS I AM NOW.

UH, SENATOR VICTOR'S WIFE, JUST
LET ME TAKE THIS IN PRIVATE.

YOU GOT BALLS CALLING ME HERE.

AND YOU DISPLAYED YOURS WHEN
YOU CUT ME OUT OF 10 MILLION

DOLLARS.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

WELL LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.

THE ARMS SALE.

I DON'T HAVE YOUR MONEY.

DO YOU KNOW THAT'S
WHAT VICTOR SAID.

AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

VICTOR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
CUTTING YOU OUT OF THE DEAL.

YOU GOT YOU'RE RETRIBUTION.

YES, BUT YOU CAN'T BUY
ITALIAN VILLAS WITH RETRIBUTION.

I DON'T HAVE YOUR MONEY.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS
STOPPING ME GOING PUBLIC?

MANNERS.

I CAN MAKE SURE THAT
YOU NEVER GET TO ME.

NOBODY WILL BELIEVE
ANYTHING THAT YOU SAY ANYWAY.

I CAN SEE THAT YOU
HANG FOR KILLING VICTOR.

NO DAMN IT, I'M WARNING YOU.

NO MATTER WHO YOU PUT AROUND
YOU, OR HOW MANY PRECAUTIONS YOU

TAKE, YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

I COULD GET TO YOU
WHEREVER AND WHENEVER I WANT.

AND I SHALL ENJOY DOING IT.

OKAY, NOW.

WHAT DOES R2D2 THINK?

STONE RAT.

DISHES.

GREAT, OKAY SO
HOW DID THEY DO IT?

I BEEN DOING THIS
FOR 10 YEARS DAN.

I'VE ALWAYS FOUND SOMETHING BUT
WE CANNOT FIND ANYTHING MAN, I

DON'T KNOW, WHAT THE HELL.

VICTOR WAS HERE, HAD A
SEIZURE FELL THIS WAY.

THEN WHATEVER IT WAS EXPLODED
UNDER HIM OR AROUND HIM.

IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

IT DOES IF HE HAD A
PACEMAKER MADE OF PLASTIQUE.

GENTLEMAN WHAT YOU GOT?

WELL UH, MADONNA AND I HAVE
ANALYZED THREE QUARTERS OF THIS

MATERIAL AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO TRACE OF ANY KIND OF

EXPLOSIVE OR FRAGMENTS FROM A
DETONATING DEVICE, NOTHING.

WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF HEADWAY.

DANNY, I WANT TO TALK WITH
YOU OUTSIDE JUST FOR A MINUTE

PLEASE.

YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
DIFFUSING EXPLOSIVES FOR METRO

ANYMORE, YOU KNOW
THAT DON'T YOU?

KEEPS ME IN PRACTICE.

SOME PEOPLE PLAY GOLF,
SOME PEOPLE PLAY TENNIS.

I DIFFUSE HIGH EXPLOSIVES.

YOU'RE WORKING FOR ME NOW DANNY
AND WE DON'T DO THE DIRTY WORK

WE LEAVE THAT FOR METRO.

I'M NOT AN AFTER
THE FACT KIND OF GUY.

C'MON, YOU'VE PAID YOUR DUES.

FBI IS A PROMOTION.

IT MAY NOT FEEL
LIKE IT BUT IT IS ONE.

SO I DON'T THINK YOU OUGHT
TO TAKE ANYMORE UNNECESSARY

CHANCES.

I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

I KNOW THAT.

BUT I'M A BIT WORRIED ABOUT
YOU DAN WITH MANDY AND NOW WITH

TERRY.

JESUS...

YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY TOO BAD
MORE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY

MARITAL PROBLEMS.

THIS IS ME TALKING TO YOU.

IT'S COMING FROM ME.

I'M FINE.

IN EVERY WAY I'M FINE.

I'M NOT LOSING IT.

JUST LET METRO DO THEIR WORK.

Â¶ Â¶

HOLD IT RIGHT HERE SIR PLEASE.

OKAY.

SIGN IN SIR.

DOUBLE ON SECURITY TODAY?

WE'VE BEEN ON BLUE ALERT
SINCE SENATOR VICTOR'S DEATH.

SPEAKING OF WHICH I HAVE AN
APPOINTMENT IN HIS OFFICE.

4TH FLOOR TO YOUR RIGHT, 407.

THANK YOU.

WIFE.

EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

SO NEXT TIME YOU GO
SPREADING RUMORS ABOUT MY WIFE.

CHECK THE FACTS WITH ME FIRST.

YES SIR.

MIRA, THANK YOU.

WAY TO GO STU.

MAN'S NOT DEAD A DAY AND THEY'RE
ALREADY MOVING SOMEONE ELSE INTO

HIS OFFICE.

THAT'S NOT TRUE.

HE WAS DEAD A DAY.

THEY SHOULD USE THE VULTURE.

HI JAMES.

TERRY.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I UH, WE HAVE BUSINESS.

LISTEN, UH.

I'M SORRY.

I'M SORRY ABOUT THE
OTHER DAY, I DIDN'T THINK.

I'M SORRY.

YOU LOOK GREAT.

YOU WANT TO GO AND HAVE SOME
LUNCH, MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE

THAT?

UH, I CAN'T I'VE GOT MEETINGS.

I GOT A MEETING TOO.

I GOTTA GO.

OKAY.

SORRY I'M LATE, SORRY.

I HOPE IT IS BECAUSE MADONNA HAS
COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW.

NO, NO SHE'S RECHARGING.

WE'RE STILL PICKING UP PIECES OF
THE SENATOR.

THE GUYS HAVE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

WE'RE TALKING
PIECES, PIECES THIS SMALL.

I MEAN WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT HIS YOU KNOW WHAT.

GENTLEMAN, WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

 HE HAD NOT
HAD TIME TO FILE THAT...

FINE WHY DON'T YOU JUST
READJUST HIS SCHEDULE.

TRAVERES...

MR. O'NEILL.

DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

I FOUND OUT THIS MORNING BUT
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD COME.

I WOULD HAVE COME
WITH A BLOWTORCH.

SENATOR TRAVERES IS
HEADING UP THIS INVESTIGATION.

THAT'S RIGHT.

NOW I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU
THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN UP ON

THE HILL ABOUT THIS.

A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SCARED.

THERE ARE LOTS OF RUMORS.

YEAH, THERE ARE A LOT OF RUMORS.

HAVE YOU READ THE
REPORT SENATOR?

YES, I HAVE READ THE REPORT
EXCEPT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

HELL IT MEANS.

I MEAN WHAT DOES IT MEAN
THAT THERE IS NO TRACE OF A

DETONATING DEVICE.

WELL...

NO, NO, LET ME FIELD THIS ONE.

LOOK MR. O'NEILL I KNOW YOU
HAVE A PERSONAL PROBLEM WITH ME.

YOU AND MY WIFE?

THAT'S NOT A PERSONAL PROBLEM.

EVERYBODY IN THE GOD
DAMN CITY KNOWS ABOUT IT.

IT'S A VERY PUBLIC PROBLEM.

LOOK, I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR
DELIVERING ANSWERS TO CONGRESS.

UNTIL I HAVE THEM, I AM GOING TO
BE WATCHING EVERY STEP OF THIS

INVESTIGATION VERY CAREFULLY.

WELL THEN WATCH VERY CAREFULLY
AS I STEP OUT THE DOOR.

O'NEILL THIS IS BUSINESS.

NOW YOU BETTER LEARN TO SEPARATE
IT FROM THE OTHER PROBLEMS IN

YOUR LIFE.

YOU TOUCH MY WIFE AGAIN, I'LL
SEPARATE YOU FROM THE REST OF

YOUR LIFE.

YOU UNDERSTAND?

IF MR. O'NEILL IS THE BEST
EXPLOSIVE EXPERT WE HAVE

THE FBI IS IN PRETTY SAD SHAPE.

DAN IS THE BEST.

AND SHANE IS A TOP
MATERIAL ANALYST.

AND I'M NOT MARRIED SO I'VE
GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, SIR.

WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER THAT SITE
AGAIN AND WE'LL KEEP ON GOING

OVER IT UNTIL WE
FIGURE THIS OUT.

I'LL HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU VERY SOON.

IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

I THINK TAKING VACATION
IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

GETTING AWAY WOULD BE GOOD.

WHO'S DRIVING?

SALVATORE SIR.

SALVATORE?

WHO THE HELL IS SALVATORE?

HE HAS BEEN DRIVING FOR US FOR
THE LAST THREE WEEKS SIR, IT'S

OKAY, REALLY.

HE'S LOSING IT.

GOOD AFTERNOON SIR.

I WANT THESE FILED BY THE
TIME I LEAVE FOR VACATION THIS

AFTERNOON.

YES, I'M CALLING TO CONFIRM
SENATOR THYME'S RESERVATION THIS

AFTERNOON.

GREAT, THANK YOU.

YOU'RE ALL SET SIR.

OH EDDIE.

ONCE THE FUNERAL IS OVER, I WANT
YOU TO ARRANGE A QUICK MEETING

WITH TRAVERES.

BUT YOUR PLANE BOARDS AT 4,

DAMN THING.

SALVATORE, WHAT THE HELL IS
WRONG WITH THE REFRIGERATOR.

I DON'T KNOW SIR, THE LIMO IS
SCHEDULED FOR MAINTENANCE BUT

THEY'RE BACKED UP.

WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

YOU?

NOW GET AWAY FROM ME, I DON'T
WANT ANY TERRORISTS MISTAKING US

FOR FRIENDS.

THE DRIVER IS STILL NOT TALKING.

I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT FRANK.

THAT STILL DOESN'T TELL US WHAT
HE USED OR WHO IS BEHIND IT.

LOOK, I KNOW YOU GUYS LIKE
CONSPIRACY THEORIES BUT IT IS

POSSIBLE HE ACTED
ALONE ISN'T IT?

UNLIKELY.

ESPECIALLY IF HE'S NOT TALKING.

THAT MEANS HE'S SCARED.

SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

I'M THINKING I
GOTTA TAKE A PISS.

YOU WANT TO HELP ME OUT?

NO.

THAT'S GOOD.

OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THESE TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST
THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COME

JUST A WEEK BEFORE THE
REVOTE AN THE ANTIARMS BILL.

THE SECRET SERVICE WILL
KEEP EXTRA SECURITY AROUND THE

PRESIDENT UNTIL THEY FIND OUT
WHO IS ACTUALLY BEHIND THESE

BOMBINGS.

SUZY BRYANT CHANNEL 7 NEWS.

AND IT'S A BEAUTY.

AND I PUT THE
WINGS AND GO WHONG.

WE'RE HERE AT THE FEDERAL
COURT HOUSE WHERE A MYSTERIOUS

EXPLOSION HAS LEFT 3
PEOPLE DEAD AND 10 WOUNDED.

 WHO IS IT?

IT'S ME.

YOU REALIZE OF COURSE YOU'RE
DEFYING YOUR OWN COURT ORDER.

I HEARD WHAT
HAPPENED, ARE YOU OKAY?

I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.

YOU WANT TO COME IN?

I PROMISE I WON'T TURN YOU IN.

SOME OF THE SENATORS HAVE
HIRED THEIR OWN BODY GUARDS.

THE NATIONAL GUARD IS ON ALERT.

OPINION POLLS ARE RUNNING 3:1
IN FAVOR OF THE TERRORISTS.

IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE.

THERE IS A CHART IN USA TODAY.

YOU WANT A DRINK?

NO, THANKS.

NICE PLACE HUH?

THERE IS A CHAIR
SOMEWHERE OVER HERE.

I'M SORRY IT'S A MESS.

IT'S THE MAID'S YEAR OFF.

I SHOULD HAVE CALLED FIRST.

OH GOD, SHE LOOKED LIKE YOU.

TESS, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU.

TESS YOU'RE MY WIFE.

I NEED YOU

I NEED TO HOLD YOU.

I ACHE FOR YOU.

WHY DID YOU COME?

WHAT IS IT?

I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE FEELING?

WE BOTH HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE SAME PAIN.

LOOK AT YOURSELF.

REMATCH NEXT WEEK?

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

GOOD GAME FRANK.

HOW THE HELL DID
YOU GET IN HERE?

I WALKED.

NOW THERE IS A MATTER OF
MY 10 MILLION DOLLARS.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

WHAT MONEY?

MUST THIS BORING GAME GO ON?

FIRST, VICTOR, THEN
THYME, AND NOW YOU.

THEY SAY DEATH
ALWAYS COMES IN THREES.

ARE YOU FAMILIAR FRANK
WITH THE ROAD TO HELL.

AND PLEASE DON'T THINK ABOUT
GOING PUBLIC BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE

A SLIGHT DIFFICULTY EXPLAINING
A 50 MILLION DOLLAR PROFIT

STEMMING FROM AND ANTIARMS DEAL
THAT YOU AND THE OTHERS PUSHED

THROUGH CONGRESS.

I DON'T THINK YOU'D GIVE UP YOUR
SEAT IN THE SENATE FOR 40 YEARS

IN PRISON.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

I SIGNED ON BECAUSE IT
WAS A HIGH PROFILE BILL.

I DIDN'T INTEND TO GET
INVOLVED WITH ANY OF THIS STUFF.

SOMEONE HAS GOT MY MONEY
FRANK, AND YOU'D BETTER FIND IT.

OTHERWISE, I'M GOING
TO BLOW YOU WIDE OPEN.

QUITE LITERALLY.

THANKS.

EXCUSE ME.

GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLEMAN.

WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD?

WELL, I SHOULD HAVE TEST
RESULTS BY THE END OF THE DAY.

YOU KNOW IF IT IS SOME KIND OF
FACSIMILE OF WATER THEN THEY CAN

PUT IT ANYWHERE.

WHAT DID YOU GET FROM YOUR...

SHANE PLEASE, WILL YOU
TURN OFF YOUR ROBOT.

I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN LOST IN SPACE.

WHAT DID YOU GET
FROM YOUR BRIEFING.

WELL IT'S REALLY VERY
INTERESTING BOTH SENATOR THYME

AND SENATOR VICTOR SPONSORED THE
MIDEAST ANTIARMS BILL WHICH IS

COMING UP FOR A REVOTE.

WHAT?

TRYING TO SCARE THE
SENATE INTO A VETO?

MAYBE.

BUT HERE I THINK IS
THE INTERESTING PART.

THERE IS ONE SENATOR LEFT WHO
SPONSORED THAT BILL WITH THEM.

WHO'S THAT?

GOD MN IT.

DAN...

DAN...

DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

LOOK IT THEY'RE PISSED BECAUSE
WE HAVEN'T COME UP WITH ANY

ANSWERS.

HE IS YOUR ANSWER.

TELL TRAVERES TO
STAY AWAY FROM MY WIFE.

SO WHAT ABOUT SATURDAY?

YOU GOING TO COME?

YOU SAID YOU WOULD.

I'D LIKE YOU TO.

I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD.

WHY, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M FEELING HERE.

NICE SECURITY PAL.

IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S OKAY.

NO, NO, NO IT'S NOT OKAY.

YOU'RE A TARGET.

LISTEN YOU PRICK.

LISTEN TO ME, ANYONE WITH HALF A
BRAIN AND A GUN COULD WALK RIGHT

STOP IT.

COME HOME WITH ME.

I DON'T NEED YOU TELLING
ME WHO I AM SAFE WITH.

TERRY, PLEASE,
COME HOME WITH ME.

TERRY!

O'NEILL YOU ARE ALREADY IN
THIS DEEP ENOUGH, C'MON.

GENTLEMAN, WHY DON'T YOU
ESCORT MR. O'NEILL OUT.

I DUG AS MUCH AS I COULD, IF I
HADN'T BEEN SO BUSY, I WOULD

HAVE GOTTEN THIS TO YOU SOONER.

FRANK TRAVERES IS A
REGULAR BOY SCOUT.

HIS TAX RETURNS ARE IN ORDER.

HE OWES FAVORS TO A FEW
PEOPLE, BUT THAT IS NOT UNUSUAL.

YOU SURE THERE IS
NOTHING IN HERE.

NOTHING THAT I COULD FIND.

WHERE IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN
WHEN YOU NEED ONE HUH?

FEEL FREE TO PERUSE THE GOODS.

IT SAYS HE IS ONLY
CLAIMING 122,000 A YEAR.

WELL THAT'S ALL HE MAKES ON
SALARY PLUS A FEW SPEAKING FEES.

THE MAN HAS A CAMPAIGN
HE IS STILL PAYING OFF.

HOW'S HE PAYING FOR THAT HOUSE.

HE DIDN'T PAY THAT MUCH
FOR IT, IT WAS IN BAD SHAPE.

HE GOT A GOOD DEAL.

WHAT ABOUT THE INSIDE.

I MEAN THERE IS A LOT
OF FROO-FROO THERE.

WELL THERE WERE
SOME REPAIR WORK.

NO, NO I'M TALKING ABOUT
MARBLE COLUMNS, HARDWOOD FLOORS.

HE'S STILL PAYING
A FEW THINGS OFF.

MARION.

ANY GUY WHO MAKES $130,000 A
YEAR DOESN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

WHAT YOU THINK THIS GUY IS
STUPID ENOUGH TO FLAUNT HIS

MONEY?

HE IS FROM MIAMI.

YOU'RE RIGHT, LOOK, I GOTTA GO.

BIG DATE?

BIG I DON'T KNOW YET, I JUST
FIGURED I COULDN'T WAIT AROUND

FOR YOUR FOREVER.

YOU'RE CRUSHING ME,
YOU'RE CRUSHING ME.

YOU'RE THE BEST.

I KNOW.

ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

GOOD LUCK SHERLOCK.

HUH...

HI...

WHA...

SHANE WHERE ARE YOU?

AT THE LAB?

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL COME DOWN, OKAY.

JUST CLEAR ME WITH UM, WITH
SECURITY OKAY SO I DON'T GET

HASSLED.

THANKS BYE.

WATCH THIS.

ALL RIGHT.

C'MON, C'MON IT
ONLY TAKES 30 SECONDS.

SO WHAT THE HELL IS IT?

IT'S UH, A WEIRD HYBRID COMBO OF
LIQUID EXPLOSIVES THAT HAVE BEEN

PUT THROUGH A PROCESS I
HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

ACTIVATED, IT'S LIKE A
COMBINATION OF NITRO, NAPALM,

HYDROGEN.

IT'S COMPLICATED.

IT IS...

WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN ACTIVATED, HOW?

WHEN YOU DRINK IT, IT'S
LIVE RIGHT WHAT THE HELL.

BUT IN THE STOMACH
IT BECOMES A DEVICE.

THEN IT HIT ME.

IT'S ACID.

STOMACH ACID.

YEAH, I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS
STOMACH ACID BUT I DIDN'T HAVE

ANY.

SO WHAT YOU GOT IN THERE?

ORANGE JUICE.

CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT.

AND IT WORKS WITH

THE CHILDREN'S CENTER.

DANNY O'NEILL.

SHOULD BE THERE ANY MINUTE NOW.
