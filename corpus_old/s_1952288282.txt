The surgical scalpel is made
of sterilized, carbonized

stainless steel.

This is a vast improvement
over the first scalpel,

which was pretty much a sharp stick.

Medicine is constantly reinventing itself.

That means surgeons have to

keep reinventing themselves, too.

I can't believe we're doing this.

It's Valentine's day.

We don't do Valentine's day.

There's more to life than the hospital.

No, there isn't.

It's romantic.

No, it isn't.

There's constant pressure
to adapt to changes.

Ambulance!

It can be a painful process.

Eyes front, ladies.

But without it...

Okay, that seemed big.

If it's big, they'll page us.

It's big.

Yes!

You'll find yourself moving backwards

instead of forwards.

Hey, what's going on?

Grandinetti's roof collapsed.

We'll be getting more than a dozen.

All scheduled procedures are pushed.

Ugh. On Valentine's day?

God, grandinetti's must have been packed.

Well, tonight's out. I
told you this would happen.

Well, that's why we went to dinner at 4:00

and exchanged gifts. Look.

Just special. Original. Magical.

Squeals of joy.
Wow. Scrooge.

Scrooge is Christmas. That's a holiday.

Dr. Bailey. Our hemicolectomy's pushed.

That's a shame. I was... I was
really looking forward to that.

Well, as... you know....

Well, maybe we could make up for it.

Dinner tomorrow?
No.

Um... just...

I'm... busy.

I have surgeries most nights.

I always have surgery.

Right. Well, um, maybe
see you in the O.R., then.

Oh, my God. She likes him.

Oh, you like him? Oh, my God.

You should totally go out with him.

You have to say yes.

Oh, no. It's Valentine's day. You have to.

Okay, see, that... this right here,

what's happening, the giggling...

the girl talk, the OMGs...
okay, it has to stop.

I am busy.

Hey, Torres.

Do you know anything about
putting together cribs?

You bought a crib?

Well, Sloan's coming home tonight,

and I got it put together, but it wobbles.

And it can't wobble.

Now will you take a look at it?

You're like a sweet, nerdy dad now.

I don't even recognize you.

Well... who's the blonde?

I don't know.

I may be a dad, but I am a single dad.

Excuse me.

Okay. Now... now I recognize you.

It must, uh,

suck to work on Valentine's day.

I don't believe we've met.

Aah! What'd you do to your hair?!

I changed it. I... I colored it.

I just...

Wait. You thought I was someone else.

You didn't know it was me
and you were hitting on me?

No, no.

I pretty much thought you were,
you know, just some blonde.

You are pathetic and hypocritical

and slutty.
And you are no blonde.

You can't pull that off.

Blondes are either badass or fun.

And you're... you're a brunette.

Damn.

Shut up!

Quit staring. I'm probably
gonna change it back anyway.

No, I... I get it.

You get dumped by your boyfriend,

and you go for the extreme makeover.

Chicks always do that.
I didn't get dumped. Okay?

And I did not do this for Mark. I just...

It's Valentine's day, and I
wanted to change something.

And... and I could change...

I... I wanted to do
something for me, okay?

This was for me.

How is that different
than what I just said?

I'm changing it back.

Restaurant roof collapse.

Yeah, so far... a
penetrating abdominal injury,

a sucking chest wound
and a massive head wound.

Also, there's an open fracture on the way.

Do you want me...
Dr. Shepherd.

Oh, you're still here?
If you're here, I'm here.

There's an osha investigator
waiting in the lobby,

and there's also two tv crews
who are asking for a statement.

I told 'em to wait for you.

They're setting up outside.
We cleared the O.R. board,

also, I paged Bailey, Nelson,
Altman, Hagan and Sloan.

As soon as I have all
of the numbers, I'll...

Do you want to get anybody else?
Stop. Who do I see first?

Skull fracture, trauma 1.
The osha guy.

Chart, please.
Try to get as many people as possible

off the backboards.

Clear C-spines clinically,

but if you're not sure, wait for x-ray

no matter how backed up they are.
Hey, hold the elevator.

I got it!
Trauma 4 is open.

Okay, uh, bring the chart, please.
Right away.

Where are they taking my husband?

Uh, he's going into surgery.

His doctors will let us know more soon.

Can you take a deep breath for me, please?

What do you have, Grey?

Decreased breath sounds on the left side.

Possibly a pneumothorax.

All right, put in a
chest tube if you need to.

Evaluate and page me if it's surgical.

Sorry. I'm sorry.

Nonresponsive...
Okay, let me see the chart.

Looks like a pretty bad break.

You're gonna have to have that reset.

I wonder if there's any chance

you could put me in a
bed next to that lady?

Yeah, sorry. It doesn't work like that.

Of course. Forgive me.

I've been a head waiter for 25 years.

I know how it works.

I'll see what I can do.

It's a depressed skull fracture
with a subdural hematoma.

All right? Let's book an O.R.
Chief.

Yeah. I need you to reassign
some anesthesiologists.

You're being cupid for Bailey.
I don't do that.

I did that once, and she yelled at me.

I'll be cupid. You just be the chief. Sign.
I am not cupid.

Dr. Shepherd, the reporters
are waiting for a statement.

I have a surgery.
Well, actually, Dr. Nelson said

he could take your skull fracture.

You've got the trustee's
breakfast in the morning,

and when the trustees
turn on the 11:00 news,

it's your face they'll want to see.

Watch it! Coming through!
I got the arm.

What do you got?

Traumatic amputation through
the left distal humerus.

Bleeding controlled through
pressure. Got 10 of morphine.

Vital signs are stable.

Okay, let's get him in trauma
3, put him on a monitor.

Push two of o-neg. Grey,
Avery, you're with me.

Chief Shepherd?

Can she have some water, please?

I'm afraid she can't.

My... Emile, stop.

My husband and I have been going to

grandinetti's for 15 years,

every Friday night.

And sometimes Tuesdays.

Emile always takes very good care of us.

But now it's time to look after yourself.

I just thought you'd want someone with you

until you found out
that Mr. Banks was okay.

Thank you.

My patient's stalking your patient.

He's being a good waiter,

and apparently, we're his busboys.

Dude gave me 50 bucks
to put him next to her.

He's got the hots for her.

Her husband is in surgery. She's married.

You're just saying that 'cause
you think you're married.

His 50 bucks says he makes a move.

You in or out?
I'm in, and I am married.

Mrs. Shepherd?

Huh?

I'm not Mrs. Shepherd.

You're not?
I'm Dr. Grey.

Right. Right.

Um, chief Shepherd
wanted me to ask you about

the trustee's breakfast in the morning.

You Shepherd's flunky now?
Is that why he hired you back?

I'm on his service this week,
and during this transition,

he needed a little more help
on the administrative side.

I'm not his flunky.

So, uh, will you be going
with him to the breakfast

or meeting him there?

I, um, am not sure I'm going.

What? No.

You have to 'cause you're his wife.

Sloan?

When did you get in? Does
Mark know you're here?

Um, no. My flight got
in a little bit early,

and I just took a cab over. I
didn't to bug him or anything.

Somebody said that you
guys have a free clinic?

Do you know where that is?
Is everything okay?

Oh, yeah. I just want
someone to check me out...

after the surgery and everything.

Maybe give me an ultrasound or something?

Yeah, the clinic closed an hour ago.

Come on. I have a second.

I'll take a peek for you.

Okay, I need another 4x4.

Okay, dress him. I'm gonna
take another look at the arm.

This wound's completely
macerated and contaminated.

Why wasn't this guy brought in first?

He was lying in dirty
dishwater for a while

before they found him.

They forgot I was back there.

No, I'm...

it's all right.

I'm not...

I'm not too big on
talking to people, and...

nobody talks to me much back there.

They just, you know, bring me the dishes.

I lost my arm.

I don't want to have one arm.

I don't want to be a freak.

I... I don't like people staring at me.

We're gonna do everything that we can.

Please.

Okay, Frankie, I'll take
you up to surgery now.

We're gonna try and
reattach the arm, okay?

We have an open O.R.
I'll prep him, work on the stump.

You debride the arm, tag the vessels,

and get it up to me as
soon as you can, okay? Okay.

Wow. Trauma room Barbie.

Okay, irrigation here
and suction, please. So...

Here you go.

Grandinetti's is gone...
a Seattle institution.

Hmm. Dr. Warren, you ever been there?

Couple times. Good scampi.

Place is so romantic...
perfectly lit, intimate,

those cozy little
booths, you know, in back.

A 3-0 silk tie, please.

It's a little too intense
for a first date, though.

Bailey, where would
you go on a first date?

Isn't there a dying child somewhere?
No. I had some time,

and I wanted to observe
one of... one of these.

Aww.

Baby looks perfect.

Awesome.

Um, can I, like, get that in writing?

Oh, even better.

Here is a souvenir.

Oh, um... well, don't
you have some kind of,

like, official form

or hospital document that you can give me?

Why do you need an official form?

Oh, well, that's none of your business.

If you want your official
form, it is, Sloan.

What's going on?

It's for the adoption attorney, okay?

They need, like, a clean bill
of health from me or something.

There's this great
couple in San Francisco,

and they have these two big dogs, and...
An adoption attorney?

Yeah. I mean, I'm not ready to be a mom.

I'm just... I'm just not ready yet.

Have you told Mark?

No. And... you're my doctor, right?

I mean, don't you guys
have some kind of rule

that says you can't say anything?

Well, I'm not gonna tell
him, and neither are you.

Do you think she needs an extra blanket?

She gets chilled easily.

She must be one hell of a tipper.

Sorry?
Well, I can see why she comes in every week.

I bet you take better care
of her than her own husband.

When she first started
coming in, before they met,

we had a little game.

She would try anything we served.

She was adventurous...

fearless.

When she'd gone through the menu,

I challenged the chefs to
come up with something new.

It became...

she became... my
favorite part of the week.

Then one night, she came in with him.

She felt like this was a
safe place for a first date.

That ring on her finger?

The night he proposed to her...

I placed it in the crème
brûlée for her to find.

I watched her say yes
from the kitchen window.

And they never stopped coming in.

But now he orders for her...

same thing every time.

For 15 years,

I've watched their conversations
grow shorter and shorter,

until now all they do is eat.

She has no children.

If he dies, she'll be...

she'll be all alone.

She's so afraid. I... I can see.

And all I want to do
is take her hand in mine

and tell her she'll be all right.

She'll never have to be alone...

if she doesn't want to be.

You'll let me know

when you have good news
about Mr. Banks, yes?

Yeah. Right. Of course.

You can't leave without telling him.

Yes, I can. I can do whatever I...
Sloan.

Crap.

When did you get here?

I mean, I thought you
were gonna call first.

Look. Oh, my God.

Would you look at that?

That's the Sloan nose.

Can you... can you see it?

Can you see it?

It's my dad's. He has my dad's nose.

That's the Sloan nose.

Damn it. Will you wait for me?

I want to... I want to take you home.

I got a surprise for you.
Oh, could I see this again?

The Sloan nose.

You win.

He's been staring at her
from his kitchen for 15 years.

He's not gonna tell her now.

He just did. She was awake the whole time.

She heard everything.
She has to say something.

Well, she's not. He...
her husband's in surgery.

So? They're clearly miserable.

I mean, did you hear the
whole crème brûlée thing?

50 bucks says she tells him she loves him, too.
You're on.

Hi.

I've got your keys.

What?
Dr. Shepherd told me you might not make it home

before the breakfast,
so I should just ask you

what you need from your closet,
and I'll go grab it for you.

You are not going in my closet.

Aren't you supposed to be a surgeon?

He really needs you by his side

at that breakfast.
I am a surgeon.

You tell the chief that
I will be in surgery.

Uh, so... so I'll just
pick something out for you.

So... Yang's with Hunt,

Grey's with Shepherd,
Torres is with Robbins,

and you were with Sloan
until he dumped you?

It's a wonder you guys got any work done.

He didn't dump me.

He forgot about me.

He decided that we were
going to start a family

and didn't ask me.

He forgot I was even there.

He... he just... left me
lying in dirty dishwater.

What?

Nothing.

I'm pretty.

What?

In my family, I'm the pretty one.

You know, uh, my eyes
and... my smile and my body.

I mean, you should see
me without a shirt on.

It's... it's kind of ridiculous.

But my family is smart, driven,

crazy overachievers, you know?

And they look like they're smart.

They don't look like
me, which had its perks,

except that my family
treated me like I'm pretty.

They expected nothing from me... ever.

They never pushed me, never thought to.

So I had to push myself...

hard.

I didn't even tell 'em
I was taking the mcat's

till after I had aced 'em.

My point is that you can't
just change your hair.

Okay, you want to be unforgettable?

You want to not be mousy?

You can't just change your hair.

You have to actually change.

I'm just saying.

Okay, I'm removing

the glass... very... slowly.

Okay, take this. Bovie.

Nice work, Dr. Bailey.

Dr. Warren, can you
believe that Dr. Bailey

almost left general
surgery for peds surgery?

Did you know that? I did not.

Yeah. No, she almost said
no to general surgery.

But then she thought about it,

and she changed her mind.

She wasn't afraid to rethink her decision.

She just needed to be asked again.
I see.

Clearly.

Do you have my report thing?

No.

He took you in, he's given you money,

he flew you to L.A. He deserves to know.

So if you're not gonna tell him, I will.

You paged me? What's going on?

You paged him?

What's the matter?

Mark, she's...

I'm giving the baby up for adoption.

I'm not a mom. I'm not ready.

And I want him to have good parents

and a good home.

No, don't. Don't do this.

Don't give this baby away.
They'll love him.

They'll love him more than I will.

Give him to me.

I'll take him. I'll adopt him.

I understand. I understand.
You're not ready, but I am.

And I know I... I don't
have the best track record,

and I... and I should've been
there for you, and I wasn't.

But I will be there for this baby. Please.

I want him to have a family. And, I mean,

you've been really nice to
me the past couple of months,

but you're not a family.
You're just a guy.

Sloan, please. I'll help.

Uh...

I'm right across the hall.

And we're a family, sort of.

And... we're doctors...

and we're best friends,

and... and we're good people.

Yeah, we'll...

we'll take care of the baby, together.

We'll love him...

really well.

Just think about it.

Go home. We'll talk about it.

Can we talk about it?

Yes. Yes, we can.

We can talk about it.

Ooh, thank God. Where'd you get those?

Patient room. Guy's in a coma.

He's not gonna miss 'em. Anything happen?

He's still asleep,

but she wants to say something.

Oh! Oh, my God. I'm starving.

Ew. These are all half-eaten.

Now you can see what they are.

What are we doing?
Her boring husband's in surgery.

This dude's been in love

with her for 15 years.
But she just found out,

so we're waiting to see
if she says something.

Or if her husband croaks.

But it's okay if he does,
because they're miserable.

I mean, is this what marriage turns into,

running out of things to
say and changing who you are?

Probably.
Yeah.

Well, I didn't marry Derek
to be the chief's arm candy.

I'm a surgeon.
Yeah, you married him for the great surgeries.

I didn't do that either.

Right.
You should've.

Ooh. Shh. She's gonna say something.

She's gonna wake him up.
Oh. What did she say?

She can't breathe. Get a crash cart.

She's got a big air leak in her chest tube.
What's happening?

Let's keep her on 100%
o-2 and get a bronchoscopy.

Grey, see if an O.R. is
available just in case.

Okay. She's having trouble breathing.

We'll let you know more as soon as we do.

We saved the arm. We
saved it. We're ready.

It's gonna have to be an amputation.

What?
There's too much

devascularized tissue,
too much contamination.

Or we can push antibiotics
and let the stump heal,

but by that time...
The arm will be dead.

Page me when he's awake. I'll tell him.

They... they can't just leave it behind.

We could move it somewhere else,
attach it to a healthy zone.

Don't tell me, mouse.
I'm... I'm just saying...

Temporary ectopic replantation!

Well, you have... you
have to keep the arm alive

until the stump heals.

Yes, but in cases involving the elbow...

It's extreme. He'll lose range
of motion, grip failure...

He'll keep his arm. He
deserves extreme measures.

If the arm is still viable,
you can't just let it die.

Has that ever been done
before, above the elbow?

I don't know, but it could be done.

You could implant onto the epigastric

and the, uh, vena commitante.

Give you a few days for the stump to heal.
I've never done one.

Neither have I.
So?

After today, you can't say that anymore.

Okay, come on. I told him that
we would do everything we could.

Do everything that we can.

I'll call Shepherd and let him know.

Grey, Avery, get ready to scrub in.

We're gonna be a while.

Okay, that?

Not mousy.

You going into surgery now?

There's this, uh, breakfast.

I know. I know about the breakfast

because there's some
resident that I don't know

rooting through my closet right now.

Sorry. She's a little overeager.

I... I have a surgery,

and I can't really give up a surgery.

No, I wouldn't want you to.
I mean, just to smile

and stand at a podium for the suits?

It's...

No, you shouldn't come.

I... you know, my patient,
she's somebody's wife, too,

and I'm her doctor, and...

Okay?
Okay.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey. I've got a tracheobronchial tear.

Transitory ectopic implantation.

Wow. Nice.

I rented a house. It's amazing.

It's right on the
water... a little cottage.

And there are deer... like "Bambi" deer...

and... and singing birds.

It's incredible.

I... I found this little
secret coffee place

down the street from here, and, uh...

And, oh, I... I was
thinking of getting a puppy.

But, you know, I... you
have to be home with a puppy,

and I... and I'm... and I'm always here.

So I... I went down to
the pound 'cause I... I...

I wanted to get it out of my system,

you know, the puppy love.

And I... I held all of
these incredibly sweet dogs,

and... you would've been really...

Really proud of me, Owen.

I didn't take one home.

I went out and got a fish instead.

Let me see. What else?
Oh, I got a bikini wax.

Yeah, I got a bikini... an actual wax.

You know, I haven't had
one of those since...

you remember when I tried to wax myself...
Okay,

all right, all right.
What... what is your point?

You were my best friend!

My best friend who I
could tell everything to.

And now you won't even look at me.

Yeah, 'cause you said you love me.

You said you loved me, too, and then...

and then you chose Yang.

You chose her, too. You chose her, too.

I feel like I'm cheating on her.

When I talk to you, I feel
like I'm cheating on her.

So I'm sorry.

And I miss my best friend, too.

Don't you have something else to do?

This is the closest I've been
to inside an O.R. in a week.

Last week, I would've
been paged in to help.

Now I'm paged about...

fund-raising brunches.

I'm adopting Sloan's baby.

It's the right thing to do. I think I can.

Mm-hmm. I certainly want to.

Callie said she'd help.

I'm having a baby.

Congratulations.

I'm happy for you.

I'm happy for you, too, chief.

It's what you always wanted, right?

Yep.

It's what I've always wanted.

How is he, Dr. Bailey?

Looks like you're nearly done,

and it's just in time for dinner

and maybe even some dancing.

If the patient looks good...
He'll be just fine.

He won't be dancing anytime soon.

But when the time comes

and he wants to go out dancing,

he will be perfectly capable

of making that determination himself,

without any help from anyone.

And I don't need any help here.

So if you are through
helping me, you can go.

Well, I just thought that...
Now.

Mm.

She's nice...

chatty...
Stop talking.

To be fair, I never said
a word about dancing.

Although...
Shh. What is all this bleeding?

Ah.

Splenic artery's torn.

Oh, he's gonna lose this
spleen. Okay, lap pads.

Where's my patient?

No idea. He must have left.

I need help in here!

Ah. There you are.

I brought your wife's
clothes for the breakfast,

and I made note cards for

your speech for this morning.
Good. Go home.

You're here, I'm here.

Honestly, I'm happy to
help with this stuff.

You are? You want to be
an executive assistant?

You should want to do surgery.

That's all I want to do.
I'm not sure I can.

I... look, I'm grateful
that you hired me back.

It's just been easier to
help out with this stuff.

It's easier coming back as that

rather than coming back as the doctor

who made a mistake and killed someone...

Killed someone's mom.

And I'm not sure I can be that person.

So if you're not sure that you need me,

then maybe I shouldn't be here.

Dr. Shepherd, I have a
patient with an epidural bleed.

Come with me.

You couldn't do it?

Actually, we could.

But, um, you need to prepare yourself.

We needed to take some
extraordinary measures.

Your arm needed a blood
supply to keep it alive

until we could reattach it,

so we had to relocate it

to where we could get one.

Is that my arm?!

What did you do? Why
would you do this to me?

What did you do to me?
It's... it's only temporary.

Okay, it... it... just for a few days.

Frankie, this is what you wanted.

You... you wanted your arm.

In the right place!

I said I didn't want to be a freak.

You shoulda left me like I was!

Oh, come on.

Did you even tell him you're leaving?

Look, I... I just wanted a place to stay

and some money.

I mean, I didn't know he
was gonna care this much.

He bought a crib.

Well, he's a good man,

and he'll be very good to your baby.

You... you could know the
baby if Mark raised him.

You could come back and visit and...

I... I don't want to know
where to come back to.

I mean, if I give him to you guys,

it's still my baby,

and I need him to be somebody else's.

I mean, my dad got

a clean break from me...

And look at him now.

Don't I deserve that?

Prenatal vitamins are
not a joke. Take them.

And do not skip any doctor's appointments.

And... if you...

get into any trouble

or you have a problem with anything...

Call us.

Just...

take care of yourself.

Thanks.

Mrs. Banks.

How's my husband?

There's been some complications,

but Dr. Bailey is working very hard.

And I'll let you know
more as soon as I do.

I... is Emile still here?

Emile is in surgery.

There's been some bleeding in his brain.

Oh, my God.

Oh, God.

He never said a word...

for 15 years.

Did you know?

Why do you think I kept going back there?

But then I met Bob,

and... Emile never...

I made a choice.

But you kept going back.

I did...

because Bob liked it...

and I loved Bob.

It became our place.

And, yes, he orders for me,

because he knows what I like.

And it may seem like we have
nothing left to talk about,

but... sometimes it's
nice not to have to talk.

15 years ago...

I made a choice.

And I keep making it every day.

That's what marriage is.

There's a lot of damage to this pancreas.

I can't get this bleeding under control.

Okay, more suction, more.

The middle meningeal artery
is completely severed.

What did I miss?

I've... I've been literally
watching this guy all night.

How could I have missed...
You

didn't miss anything.
The first CT was negative.

There were no neurological symptoms.

It's the kind of bleed you never

know about until it's too late.
Is it too late?

I don't know yet. Bipolars.

BP's 80 over 60 and falling.

Push another atropine.
Damn it.

Come on.

Damn it. Come on.

Stay with me now. Come on. Stay with me.

Come on. Stay with me.

Stay with me. Come on. Come on.

The dude waited on tables

and watched his life happen without him.

He's probably better off.

I can't.

I can't do this. I can't just...

I can't just watch people die.

I can't.

I... I shouldn't have come back.

I... I...

Listen...

I made a mistake last year.

I almost walked away.

If you don't feel the losses...

if they don't hurt you

and humble you...

that's when you know

you're not cut out for this kind of work.

You can be a good surgeon, Kepner.

It's why I brought you back.

Congratulations. You know,
I thought we'd lost him,

but you managed to...
I can't talk to you.

Right. Um...

Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

I thought you and I might get to...

I can't talk to you. You make me nervous.

I... forget what I...

and I... say things I don't want to say.

And I can't j... I just go stupid.

I...

I like you. That's all. There.

All right.

And so if you want to go to dinner, fine.

I will show up and try to talk.
How's tomorrow night?

Fine. I might have surgery.

Well, I... I might join you.

How many stars you think you possess?

You can tell your patient
her husband's gonna be okay.

What about Emile?

Shepherd said there was no
way to know it was detectable

until it was too late.

Here.

I think this means you win.

I know. I don't want it.

Well, I don't want it either.
You would've won anyway.

You think?

Of course. That's her husband.

Grey. You ready to scrub in?

I have a valve replacement.

You know, I...

Yang is still here. Can she do it?

We have to keep reinventing ourselves...

almost every minute...

because the world can
change in an instant...

Hello, Mrs. Banks.

How's Emile doing?

I'm sorry.

We did everything we could,

but the bleeding in his
brain was too severe.

I'm very sorry.

Thank you.

And there's no time for looking back.

All those people out there,

they just want to stare at me.

They do. The doctors want to see you.

They want to ask you questions

because you're very rare...

and special.

And there might be press,

and there's a personal injury lawyer

floating around somewhere
that thinks that restaurant

might owe you a lot of money.

How much money?

Sometimes change is good, right?

Oh.

I don't believe you.

You don't have to do that.

I wanted to, before you got home.

And you don't have to do
what you offered to do.

I'm not gonna hold you to that.
Mark...

but thank you so much for offering.

And, uh...

it could be kinda great, right?

Sometimes the changes are forced on us...

What are you doing?

Sit down.

Sometimes they happen by accident...

Oh, get used to it. I'm keeping it.

You should. You're moving on.

I mean, I... I didn't
mean that was a bad thing.

It's what you should do.

I hate Valentine's day.

Me, too.

And we make the most of them.

Hey, Owen.

Hey. Hi. Uh, d... do you have a minute?

Oh, I'll... I'll wait in the car.

No, no, stay. It's...
it's... it's fine if you stay.

I said that I... I love you,

and it's out there, and I know
that I can't unring the bell.

But I'm... I'm unringing the bell. I... I take it back.
I'm gonna go.

No, no, stay.

I miss my friend, Owen.

More than anything, I miss... my friend.

The rest I can deal with.
I can deal with it. It's...

I have a job that I love

and an amazing student to teach,

and I've got a... I've
got a cottage with deer

and a fish and various waxed body parts.

I'm gonna be fine.

You and I are gonna be friends.

And you're doing a valve
replacement with me in ten.

Really?

Go prep 22-19.

Okay.

We have to constantly

come up with new ways to fix ourselves.

You can't unring the bell.

I know.

But I'm gonna try like hell.

So we change.

We adapt.

Good to see you, Chief.
Good to see you, too.

Hey.
-Hi.

Hey. You didn't have to come.
I know I didn't. I chose to.

Shall we go in?
Yes.

We create new versions of ourselves.

Mrs. Shepherd?!
I know.

Mrs. Shepherd?
I know.

I don't do brunches,

I don't miss surgeries, and
I don't do Valentine's day.

We just need to be sure

that this one is an
improvement over the last.

You're gonna have to make this
up to me with a lot of sex.

Yes, dear.
