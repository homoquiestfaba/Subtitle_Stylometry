[Religious chanting in Spanish]

[speaking Spanish] Demonio!

[Religious chanting in Spanish]

[in Spanish] Come here, my love.

Don't be afraid.

[in Spanish] I'm not afraid, Mama.
I'm strong.

You'll seeâ€¦

Everything's going
to be all right, okay?

Everything's going to be all right.

My little girl, look at me.

[Religious chanting in Spanish]

Don't be afraid.

Don't be--

[both screaming]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[insects buzzing]

[haunting music playing faintly]

â™ªâ™ª

[chicken clucking]

â™ªâ™ª

[woman in English] Hello?

[in Spanish] Do you speak English?

[in English] My name is Cristina Lopez.

I, I am an Americanâ€¦

A reporter.

[in Spanish] Why were you at La Boca?

La Boca?

Okay, yesâ€¦

I'm doing a story.

I'm hereâ€¦

I was invited to do a story

on some of the local tribes
and cultures.

â™ªâ™ª

[in Spanish] What were you looking for
in La Boca?

I'm trying to tell you,
to explain why--

backgroundâ€¦

research for the story,
for the piece.

You understand?

Is this about money?
Because I can get that for you.

[in Spanish] This is how it is.
This is how it will be.

I have a number
that you can call,

and they'll pay, I swear.

Please, I just--

I need my bag.

[in Spanish, haltingly] Do you, umâ€¦

No.

Uh, do you know

Miranda Flores?

-Miranda?
-[in English] Yes, yes.

Yes, she'll tell you.
She's my cousin.

If you find her,
she'll tell you.

I should not be here.


[chicken squawks]

[haunting music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[woman in Spanish] She has it.

[in Spanish] "Has it"?

No. No.

[in English] No, I don't have anything.

[in Spanish] I don't have anything!
No, no, no, no! No!

-[chokes]
-[in Spanish] This is how it is.

This is how it will be.


This is how it is.
This is how it will be.

[gasping, coughs]

This is how it will be.


[door squeaks, closes]



What. The actual. Fuck?

[thunder rumbles]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[sinister laughter]


[insects chirping]

[otherworldly screaming]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[otherworldly screaming]

[screaming continues]

[insects chirping]

[chicken clucks]

[bird calling]

[in Spanish] May I?

-[in Spanish] Go ahead.
-Miranda.

[in English] Oh, thank God.
Are you all right?

No, I'm pretty goddamn
far from all right.

Look, I tried to tell them

I am not whoever
they think I am.

They just don't understand
what I'm saying.

They don't believe
they can let you go.

Well, tell them they can.

Please.

La Boca, why did you go there?

Why does that even matter now?

I told you not to.

-It was not safe.
-Are you serious?

Because it's my job

to go to places
people tell me not to go.

There are 10,000 caves
in these jungles.

-What difference does it make?
-It's not a cave. It's a ruin.

What does it matter?

What matters
is that I told you not to go.

Do you know these people?

They've always been here.

The old man, Javiâ€¦

He's her son.

He helps. The woman,
she practices the old ways.

She'sâ€¦ a <i>bruja</i>?

This isâ€¦

insane.

They wish to help you.

Miranda, I'm in chains.

They're forcing goat milk
down my throat.

I'm pissing in a bucket.

They have seenâ€¦
something inside you.

You care to elaborate?

A demon.

A demon?

They think I have
a demon inside me?

Okay. [chuckles]
So this is easy.

I don't.

Tell them and get me
the fuck out of here.

They won't let you leave
with whatever is in you.

You have to do something,
call someone,

get the authorities.

These people hereâ€¦

they <i>are </i>the authorities.

I need my--my bag.

Can you ask them
if they have it?

I can show them
what I've been doing.

[Miranda in Spanish]
Javi, did she have a bag?

-Look.
-[camera beeps]

You see?

Nothing, no demons.

La Boca.

[in Spanish] Javi, please.

[muffled Spanish]

[suspenseful music plays]

[cell phone ringing]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

-Carson?
<i>-Cristina?</i>

I'm being held hostage.
I'm somewhere west of Catemaco.

Please, you have
to come find me!

Call someone!
Call the embassy!

-I'm in the fucking jungle!
<i>-Cristina!</i>

[cell phone beeps]

[door rattles, slams]

She'll begin tomorrow,
first light.

Hold on.

If they think it workedâ€¦

if they cure me or exorcise me
or whateverâ€¦

Will they let me go?

[traditional Latin music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Hey.

Hey, wait, wait, wait.
It's okay.

No, do you speak English?

[in Spanish] Do you speak English?

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[chicken clucking]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[in English] How about you, huh?
Little help?

Any idea where we are?


Oh, no English either.

Got it.


<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[dramatic music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[telephone ringing]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[drawer opens, closes]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Don't give me that look, Chip.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


Where you grew up?

to talk about it.

You never talk about it,
which is why

I'm more than a little
concerned you want this one.

<i>When's the last time you slept?</i>

<i>I missed a deadline?</i>

-Carsonâ€¦
-Hmm.

I'm good.

I meanâ€¦

I could be better.

Yeah.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[grunts softly]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[Javi chanting in Spanish]

[percussive music plays]

Oh, shit.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

-Okay, we're--we're starting?
-Breathe.

W-w-what's happening?

What are they doing
right now exactly?

They say it came last night.

No, no, no, no, no,
that was not that.

This will show them more.

[speaks in Spanish]

that live in those ruins.

[speaks in Spanish]

She says this will show
her its name.

[speaks in Spanish]

She says you will see many things.

[speaks in Spanish]

Maybe not nowâ€¦
but soon.

[speaks in Spanish]

The demon will
show itself to you.

When you see, you must
tell her right away.

[speaks in Spanish]

That way it won't get stronger.

What happens
if I don't see it?

[in Spanish] She wants to know what
happens if she can't see it?


[in Spanish] You will see.

You will see.

-[laughing]
-[Cristina laughs nervously]

[suspenseful music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Wait, Miranda,
where are you going?

This part you do alone.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[breathing rapidly]


Okay.

Fuck it.

[inhales deeply]
Here we go.

Oh, God.

Oh.

Oh, my God.

[breathing heavily]

It's happening!

I see it!

It's a really fucking
horrible thing!

Aah!


<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[soft hissing]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Hey.

Hey!

Hey!

There's a snake in here!

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

There's a fucking snake in here!

Hello?

[in Spanish] Help!

Miranda?

Someone help!

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Oh, my God.


Oh.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[in Spanish] Help!

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Oh, my God.

Someone!

Miranda!

Please!

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[dramatic music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[water splashing]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[door creaking]

Can I bring you anything else?

Where were you?

When you heard me screamingâ€¦

Why didn't you help me?

I am helping.

You believe them.

You actually believe in this shit?

Didn't you go to school
in Mexico City?

You should know things.

You're supposed
to at least be my family.

Don't say that word
like you know what it means.

[in Spanish] Yes, you are my family,

[in English]
but you haven't been for a lifetime.

That wasn't my choice.

Twenty years?

Never once?

I didn't askâ€¦

when you returned here

because you are family.

You want to help me?

I need you to convince them
that this is working.

It will show itself.

They will know.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

This isn't where I was meant to die.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


[haunting music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


[door creaks, slams]

[animal groans softly]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[groaning continues]

Aah!

What happened?

I don't know.

You couldn't see?

I felt sick.

Maybe it was something I ate.

Iâ€¦

was confused.

Bad goat's milk?

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[woman in Spanish] It's almost here.

What are those?

Thought you might like
to know what's inside you.

You know I can't
read this, right?

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


You still don't believe?

I mean,
this is a little much.

-And before?
-What do you mean before?

Are you talking about my--

What happened
with your mother.

You can't remember
what you saw then?

You can't understand
what you see now?

I don't know
what's in my food.

I don't know what's in my milk.

I don't know what day it is.

I don't even know
what time it is.

One phone callâ€¦

how much?

They don't have to know it was you.

I don't want money.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

I won't make it.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

This isn't you.

It's what's inside you.

It fears that you will let it go.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Mirandaâ€¦

Wait.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Which one is it?

That she can see?

The red book.

I marked the page.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[door opens, closes]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[mysterious acoustic guitar music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

"Postehki."

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

-[chain thuds]
-[gasps]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[bed scraping across floor]

[door creaks open]

What's that?

Something to protect you.

Our <i>abuelita </i>made one for each of us

to ward off
any evil spirits

that escaped.

You don't believeâ€¦

but I do.

[dramatic music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

That one was yours.

I saved it.


<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Why did you go to La Boca?

You can't speak Spanish anymore.

You don't believe in
the culture or the traditions.

I saw itâ€¦

in your eyes.

<i>When I told you to stay away</i>
<i>from that place,</i>

<i>that it had always been</i>
<i>a dangerous, cursed place,</i>

that people do not return
from La Bocaâ€¦

<i>Your eyesâ€¦</i>

they came to life.

<i>You had found what you came back for.</i>

After your motherâ€¦

Aah!

<i>After you were takenâ€¦</i>

<i>Abuelita </i>told me
there was a sadness

inside of me,

like a seed,

and for a time,

I could nurture it, feed it,
give it what it needed,

but then I would have to starve it

before it bore fruitâ€¦

Because that is what they feast upon.

But you were found

before it could consume you,
[in Spanish] thank God.

How did they find me?

[haunting music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Cristina?

What?

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Iâ€¦ I don'tâ€¦

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[mutters, breathing heavily]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[chanting in Spanish]

This is a spirit healing,
a psychic surgery.


[suspenseful music plays]

[chanting in Spanish]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


Hey.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>




Ah.
[breathing heavily]

What is that?

[haunting music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

That was different.

[in Spanish] We need to go deeper.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


Oh!
What the fuck?

Aah! My--

No!

Oh, my God!

Aah!

Stop, stop, please! God!

No!

[in Spanish] Get it out, get it out.

Oh!

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Oh, please!

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

No.

Oh.


Oh, my God.


[in Spanish] Pull it, help me.

Help me.

Miranda.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


Miranda.

Please help me!

Miranda!


<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>




Mm.

[door opens]

I, um--
[clears throat]


-It was only--
-Don't say necessary.

None of this is fucking necessary.

It was you.

[dramatic music plays]

No one goes to this place.

<i>No one else could find meâ€¦</i>

<i>except you.</i>

You brought me to them.

I didn't know how far
they would have to go,

-how deep it was--
-Of course you wouldn't call.

you wouldn't do anything.

This is what you wanted.

Only to help, Cristina.


[suspenseful music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


[breathing shakily, whimpering]

[light clatter]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


[cries softly]


No!

No!


[haunting music plays]


<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

In the corner.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[in Spanish] This is a holy place.

[bells jingling]

You are not welcome here.

[dramatic sting]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


[in Spanish] You want milk?

It's still inside of me,
isn't it?

[in Spanish] Help me.

[in English] Please.

[soft dramatic music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[in Spanish] Where there is forgiveness,
there is peace.

I'm sorryâ€¦

if you even understand that.

Oh, here, I-I got it.

Hand me some bandages?

Wait, you understand me?

Okay.

Well, that would have been
helpful to know.

How come you didn't let me know
that you understood me?

Because I'm not the first
person who's attacked you.

Yeah.

I guess I'd keep
my distance, too.

[in English] You will keep talking?


I ask a lot of questions.

Force of habit.

What's that?

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

How did she know that
there was something inside me?

What did she see?

Well sometimes,
when she looksâ€¦

something else looks back.

How long have you been doing this?

My father helped.

He died when I was
[in Spanish] around 16 years old.

Naturally orâ€¦

unnaturally?

Something went wrongâ€¦

[in Spanish] with an exorcism.

[in English] It found my father.

My mother,
she couldn't get it out.

He was strongâ€¦ for us.

He went to the riverâ€¦

swallowed stonesâ€¦

and was gone.

What happens
when your mother's gone?

Will you be taking over?

Not my path.

My mother, she got very sick.

We didn't even have money
for her medicineâ€¦

but somehow we managed
to get a healer.

After it didn't workâ€¦

I was put into foster care.

[somber music plays]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

You know, one little dose
of medicine insteadâ€¦

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

It could have
changed everything.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

That healerâ€¦

she had no idea
what she did to my life.

Or maybe, I don't know,
maybeâ€¦


Maybe it <i>was </i>something.

Someone needs to fight these demons

or spirits or whatever.

Noâ€¦

The old ways die with her.

We have no moves left.

[in Spanish] Demonsâ€¦

Demonsâ€¦

Demons.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

The broken man.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Postehki, the death god
of broken things.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

<i>Fills you with darkness,</i>
<i>feeds on pain.</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Broken souls returning
to be consumed.


<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

This. What about this?

The broken man?

-No.
-No, what?

-This is--
-Drawing it out.

Making it real.

If we bring it out,
can we destroy it?

It's very dangerous.

It's very painful.

Can we do it?

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Okay, is it focused?

Am I in focus?

Okay, just fuck it.
Press the record button.

[camera beeps]

In three, twoâ€¦

This is Cristina Lopez.

A few weeks ago,
I came to the city of Catemaco

looking for a lost culture,

one of people whose beliefs

couldn't be more different fromâ€¦

I'm sorry.


Just one more time.

[chair rattling]

My name is Cristina Lopez.

I came to this place to die.

[soft music plays]

I took this assignment
because I knew it would keep me

as far away from the things I had seen

and the things I had done

than I could ever hope for.

I chose to go to a place

where no one would find meâ€¦

Where people warned me
to keep away fromâ€¦

A place where I could die
in the darkness.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

I wouldn't be here,

exceptâ€¦

there are people in this world

that are very different than meâ€¦

people who see someone in pain

and sufferingâ€¦

and they don't turn away in disgust.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

So if you want to follow me,

I can show you
around a little bit.

Over here, we got my bed,

also occasionally
breakfast nook.

Oh, over in this corner,
we got aâ€¦

a half bath,

and, uhâ€¦

Thisâ€¦

this was a gift from my family.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


What's your name?

Hmm?

[in Spanish] What's your name?

Luz.

Luz.

[in English] Thank you, Luz.

[woman singing in Spanish]

[in Spanish] This is how it is.

The old waysâ€¦

die with you.

I wish I was a better person.

For her sacrifice.

[in English] Do not wish to be better.

Just be.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Is it really gone?

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[thunder rumbles]

Venti, extra-hot,
half-caff soy latte.


I ordered theâ€¦

pumpkin spice?

-Is that right?
-Oh, that's right.

[both chuckle]

Perfect.

You will go back
to Los Angeles?

To the traffic and the barsâ€¦

and forget about all of this again?

I mean,
what's the alternative?

Maybe this is
where you belong.

That place doesn't exist.

[soft music plays]

I never thought
you'd come back, Cristina.

None of us did.

-[cell phone rings]
-Andâ€¦

-Hold on.
-Here you are.

-Hold on.
-[cell phone beeps]

-Hello?
<i>-Cristina?</i>

-Carson.
<i>-Cristina?</i>

Can you hear me?
Hold on.

I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

-Can you hear me?
-[door opens, closes]

I can--I can hear you, yeah.

<i>-Are you okay?</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

No.
No, no, stop.

Don't come looking for me.

Just--just go to the village, okay?

I'll find you.

[eerie whispering]

Miranda?

Miranda?

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Leave.

You have no reason to stay.

Miranda--

-Leave!
-I want to be here.

I asked for more time
to be hereâ€¦

with you.

You don't belong here.

Miranda--

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Oh, God.

She didn't destroy it.

It got out.

Cristinaâ€¦

stop it.

Oh, it's inside you.

You're scaring me!

I'm so sorry, Miranda.

I don't feel it.

I don't feel anything.
I-I only feel--

Empty.

She's gone.

They're gone.
We can't stop it.

-You can.
-No.

You know what this is.
You've faced it.

-You read the books. You--
-No, I can't.

I'll only hurt you.
I'll make it worse. I can't.

You don't believe, but I do.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

Cristina?

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

What is it?

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


[in Nahuatl] "Light fall
upon the darkness.

Fire wash the soul."

Cristinaâ€¦

you're hurting me.


"To the earth you are driven.

To the ground you are trapped."

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>


"You are broken."

[demonic shriek]

"You are bare.

You are lost."



"You are found."

Cristina, stop.

Please stop.

Stop!


You want this.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

You want me to hurt her.

You <i>need </i>me to hurt her.


<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

[chuckles demonically]

[in Nahuatl] She must be broken.

Hear my voice and understand.

I won't leave you alone again.

She cannot be saved.

Only sacrificed.

Miranda, listen to me.

It can't live inside you.

It's starving.

She must dieâ€¦

for the darkness to grow.

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

I see you.



Miranda?


[wind whistling eerily]

<i>â™ªâ™ª</i>

What is it?

[wind whistling eerily]

What do you see?

It's here.

What?


It'll find us.

It won't stop.

Cristina, please.

Come on.

This is why you brought me here.


I'm not what you made me.
