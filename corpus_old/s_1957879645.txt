<i>â™ª Father Christmas again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If you've come to wonder â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For a while â™ª</i>

She is just so beautiful.
Just like her mum.

[chuckles]
Oh...

We are gonna have
the most peaceful Christmas this year.

Just the three of us.
[whispers] Yes.

[chuckles softly]

You're sure your parents don't mind
that we're not going to them this year?

They're fine, darling.

I told them we'll see them
in the New Year.

Oh, good. I just
couldn't face the journey.

I mean, this little munchkin is
enchanting, but she's exhausting.

Plus, I <i>hate</i> the holidays.

I just find everyone so annoying.

Well, we are going to be alone.

Hmm.

My family were pretty appalling
last year, weren't they?

Your family are mad.
[chuckles softly]

I know.
[chuckles]

But it all ended well, darling.

I love you.
I love you.

[phone ringing and vibrating]

[baby crying]
[angry whisper] Hello. Who is this?!

It's Caroline. Your sister?

Caroline, are you insane
calling this late?

Joanna, what are you talking about?
It's not late, it's 8 PM.

I left you three messages,
and you never called me back.

Is that Chloe crying?

Who else would it be? She was sleeping
and you have woken her up.

God knows how long it's gonna
take me to get her down again.

Well, I am sorry, but why do you keep
a phone in her bedroom? It's absurd.

She was in bed with me, Caroline.
Now, what do you want?

Have you heard from Vicky?

to Vicky lately.

She's off in Tibet, finding herself.
[Felix] Shh...

Of course. I'm in London.

We need to call an emergency
sisters meeting.

Oh, God. What has
the Christmas family done now?

It's Dad! He's disappeared!

What? Again?

Sisters! Come in quick. I've got milk on.

I haven't slept a wink since you called.
I am exhausted.

All I do is pick up
all this stuff, bring it here,

and the second I turn around again,
it's just come back. Oh, yeah.

Okay, Caroline, my tree isn't decorated.

Can you just stop staring at it?

[chuckles softly] I wasn't.

Yes, you were.
I only bought it yesterday.

It's lovely.

She's adorable.

Yeah. She's Daddy's little girl.

So, it's good to see you
in London, Caroline.

How's everything at the manor?

Oh, you know, wonderful.
[chuckles softly]

Okay, can we just start
this emergency sisters meeting?

Okay, that's my cue to leave.

No, baby. Baby, stay.
No, it's fine. It's perfectly fine.

I'll be with little baby girl upstairs if
you need me. Come on, bubba.

Let's leave Mummy
to talk with her sisters.

I had a call two days ago from Jackie.

We've kind of developed a friendship.

Really?
Really.

And guess what? She and Dad
broke up two months ago.

Dad told her that he wasn't
in love with her anymore

and he told her to pack
her things and leave.

Just like that?

You see? He finally saw through her.

And I saw through her
the minute I met her, remember that.

Well, actually,
I think she's rather sweet.

I mean, when I spoke to her yesterday,
she seemed very sad about the whole thing.

And she's terribly worried about Dad.

You've spoken to her too?
Yes, of course.

Anyway, she's been trying
to call him for days

and he's just completely disappeared.

The neighbors went round to the house,
and it's all closed up.

But Jackie went to the house,

and she had a quick look
at Dad's credit card statements.

And Dad has made several payments
from a hotel in Nevis, in the Caribbean.

I've tried to call him there, he's not
taking any calls. Completely disappeared.

I think Dad is having
a massive emotional reaction.

He must be totally depressed.

What... what does Mum say about all this?

Well, Mum's on a cruise
in the Nile with Uncle John.

Ugh.
[Caroline] Yes, but it's fine.

It's fine. Everything's fine.

Why? Why is it fine?

Well, because I booked tickets
for the three of us.

We're going to the Caribbean
this afternoon.

What?

Yes. Boost Dad's morale,
perk him up a bit,

and we'll all be back here in England
by the 22nd, just in time for Christmas.

You two are insane. That is a...
[Felix] It's a wonderful idea.

I couldn't help but listen.

Darling, you need to do this.

You know, go find your dad, get some sun,
and come back for Christmas.

There is no way I am leaving you two.

That would make me a terrible mother.

You're a wonderful mother.
But you need a break.

It's only for a few days.
And you do look a little bit...

What?

Exhausted.
Mm-hmm.

Really?

Well, I mean...

Okay, I... I could do
with a bit of sleepy time.

Definitely, sweetheart.

Jolly good. You might want to start
packing. The flight leaves at four.

Four?
What?

Oh, baby.
[Felix shushes]

Mummy has to leave you, darling.

And she's never left you before, but she
has to go with her annoying sisters.

Okay, girls, let's do it.

Great. Let's go save Dad.

[Caribbean version
of "Achy Breaky Heart" playing]


[song continues]

[all cheering]

Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for my brother,

Mr. James Christmas!

Jimmy Ray Love!

[cheers and applause]

Thanks, man.
Great job, man.


Mr. Christmas, great name
for the holidays, right?

Can I get a "ho ho ho"?!
Ho ho ho!

Ho ho ho!
Ho ho ho!

One, two, three, four!

[Caribbean music playing]

Whoo! [chuckles]

Wow, Megan, you've got
some serious moves out there.

Well, you can say the same
for yourself, James.

[chuckles softly] I love the Caribbean
twist on that song.

[chuckles softly]

Excuse me, boss.

Do you mind if I interrupt this magical
moment to take your drink order?

Frank, you killed it.

Couple of your famous margaritas, please.

I just made two. Coming right up.

You staying for Christmas?

Oh, that's like a week away, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.

I made a promise to myself I wouldn't plan
anything that far ahead anymore.

Well, if you can plan
as far as this afternoon,

maybe you could join us
at the beach yoga session.

Our teacher, Vaughn, is very good.

Okay, I'm in.

Well, Mr. Rhythm, you got yourself a date.

[seagulls squawking]

[soft music playing]

[lighter clicks]

[wind blowing]

Jimmy!

Hey, James! What you doing out here?

Come on up, man!
Let me buy you a drink!

Sweet spot you got here.

You're looking at the new owner
of this little piece of paradise.

I haven't exactly moved in yet,

but I'm spending more and more time here.

Congratulations.

Mind if I ask you a private question?

Sure.

You're a big star back in America.

Why are you hiding out on a little
Caribbean island, singing in a beach bar?

I reckon everybody on this island
is asking that same question.

I wouldn't know.
I don't really take part in gossip.

I'll be honest with you, my friend.

Back in the day...

I woke up every morning
just living to write another song.

Music was everything.

I wrote a bunch of songs.

And got damn lucky a couple times.

Real lucky.

But my Dad always said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good."

He was right about that.
[both chuckle]

Anyhow...

what goes up must come down.

Yeah, I learned that the hard way.

Music business...

became all about the business.

Music just got lost.

I dried up.

Couldn't write a damn song if I had to.

Just wasn't inspired.

One day I got to thinking...

music is a common thread

between the heart and soul
and the universe.

Yeah. Anyway...

I'm still searching.
I just don't know what I'm searching for.

But I'll tell you one thing that changed.
When I came here?

I was at peace.

Just loved it here.

And I never left.

I'll drink to that.

[glasses clink]
Right on, my brother.

[upbeat music playing]


[meditative music playing]

That's it. Breathe.

Let the majesty of the island feel it.

Inhale...
[inhales deeply]

Exhale out. That's good.

Listen to the silence.

I can't believe you didn't make us
a reservation at the hotel.

It would have tipped him off
that we were coming, and knowing Dad,

he would have just disappeared
to another island or something.

Well, okay, but we better
find him before Christmas

because I need to get back to my baby.

I know. But we had to come here
and find Dad.

I mean, we... we don't know where he is.

It can't be that difficult.
It's a very small island.

[meditative music playing]


Dad! Dad?!

Look! Look at over there!


[sisters shouting in unison] Dad!

Dad!
Daddy!

Daddy, it's us! Dad!

Ladies, we're having a yoga session here.

[James] Oh, dear Lord.
Please.

[sisters] Dad! Dad!
Do you know these people?

I'm afraid I do.
[Joanna] Dad!

I'm so sorry. I have to go.

It's not a problem.

Sorry.

[Joanna] Dad! Come on!
All right! You three!

Dad!

Dad, what are you doing here?

What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm doing yoga on the beach.

Well, yeah, we can see that.
We have been worried sick about you.


What are you doing here, girls?
Well, you totally disappeared.

Jackie rang me. She was
in a complete panic.

All right. I told Jackie
that she was too young for me.

She had to move on with her life.

Dad, we don't care about Jackie.
We care about you.

Yes. We've called the hotel so many times.
I've left so many messages.

Can't a man disappear without being
hunted down by his nosy daughters?

[Caroline] No.
You see?

This is what our father is like.

Joanna, what are you even doing here?
What about Felix and Chloe?

They're at home, in London.

And I'm here because these two nutcases

imagined you lying half dead
on a beach somewhere.

<i>I</i> am here to rescue you, Daddy.

Aren't you just a little
bit happy to see us, Dad?


Come here. Give me a hug.


Get you all checked in.

Once you're settled in,
we have a lot to discuss.

Now that's what I call a family.

[sentimental music playing]

Hey, it's me.

Hey. Hi, honey. You made it, then.

[Chloe crying]
Oh, look at that beautiful little baby.

we've got a crying baby.

[Felix shushing]

It's good. Have you found your dad yet?
<i>- Hey.</i>

Hey. Yeah, Dad is absolutely fine.

Can you believe it? He was doing yoga
on the beach when we arrived.

Yoga? [chuckles] Good for him.

Look, darling, I've got a crying baby
here. I think she's hungry.

Oh, well, kiss her for me.
Does she miss me?

Of course she does.

<i>It's all right.
Say bye-bye to Mummy.</i>

Love you.
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>

<i>Look, get some sleep.
I've gotta go. All right.</i>

[phone beeps]
Miss you.

[birds chirping]
[door opens]

So?
Hey, Daddy.

How is my little granddaughter doing?

Oh, Daddy, she is just gorgeous.

Do you have a picture?
I do.

There. Look at that, that was yesterday.

Ah.

I mean, don't get me wrong.
She's a handful.

Look who her mother is.

[chuckles sarcastically]

Well, she's adorable.

How's Felix doing?
He's fine.

Oh. And you?
How are you, my daughter?

I'm fine.

Though, I am pretty stressed
most of the time.

I mean, having a baby is wonderful.

But it's a bit like being
in the eye of a storm.

It's magnificent, fabulous...

but scary.

I don't know if I'm doing
everything right, Dad.

I mean, there's just so much
for me to remember.

Some of the time, I just self-indulgently
throw myself on the sofa and cry.

Does that make me a bad mum?
Not at all.

Your mother and I were lost
when you came along.

We were just 17 years old.
Your mother was scared senseless.

But you'll see, it gets easier day to day.

Sure?
Absolutely.

It's the circle of life.

Now get up, I told your sisters to meet us
at my favorite place in Nevis for a drink.

Are you okay, Dad?

Of course. Come on, let's go.


[lively music playing]

I swear, the first diaper
I changed nearly made me pass out.

I mean, she seemed
such a tiny little thing.

Where did it all come from?

[chuckling]
Whereas Felix,

he took to it like a duck to water.

Honestly, I really think they have

some little secret sign language
going on behind my back.

Having a child changes a woman.

It brings out the best in her.

Are you saying,
I was any different before?

What? No. Not at all.

Caroline?
Hmm?

How about you and Peter?
How are things with you two?

Oh, well... after last year's crisis,

things are just perfect.

We now have sex twice a week,
Saturdays and Wednesdays.

[chuckles softly]

Oh, gosh, you probably
mark it down in your awful little planner.

Oh, I don't need to.
I have an alert on my phone.

I never knew that shopping for sexy
lingerie could be quite so exciting.

You have no idea how many
shades of red there are.

Unbelievable!

She'll be telling us
what he says in bed next.

"Yes." That's what he says in bed.

Yes. [giggles]
[Joanna] God.

What has become of my... my nomad,
runaway, insane daughter Vicky?

Where is she? What's up?

Well, she's in Tibet... or India.
One of them.

Anyway, she's on an ashram
studying meditation

and getting in touch with her inner self.

Or with her guru's outer self. [chuckles]

a free spirit, Joanna.

You of all people should know that.

And you, you ditched
this whole Beatle thing?

Yeah. I finished my thesis,
and I shed my Fab Four persona.

Yes. And this... this new skin
you're sporting is...?

Can't you tell?

Only the greatest female
blues singer of the '60s.

Janis Joplin!
Ah.

I am writing a book about her days
in Haight-Ash bury.

San Fran, Woodstock, that whole thing.

Fascinating.
Promise me...

at some point,

you'll take the time
to think about you, Paulina.

That beautiful girl inside.

She deserves to see
the world too, you know.

What about that girl that, you know,

the pretty girl that you met
at... at the bar?

The... the really cute one when we all went
out and got drunk at the local pub.

Oh, gosh, what a night that was.

Yeah, when Jackie
nearly blew your house up.

We broke up.

I believe I've evolved.

Okay, so speaking of breaking up, Dad,

why don't you tell us all about Jackie?

Yes. She seemed so good for you.

Was she?

Well... yes. Yes, she was.

But we... evolved too.
I had to let her go...

in favor of some... new beginnings.

But what's important is now.

This very moment, I am
on a Caribbean island...

with three of my magnificent
four daughters,

and I couldn't be happier.

This couldn't be more beautiful,
more wonderful.

To the Christmas family.

Christmas family.
Christmas family.

Cheers.
[glasses clink]

Oh, my God!

[country music playing]

It can't be, can it?

What?

What is it, Paulina? Spit it out.

Only one of the greatest
country singers of all time.

Jimmy Ray Love!

Jimmy. Jimmy, come on over here,
and say hi to my daughters.

Come on. Come on, sit here, Paulina.

[Jimmy] How you doing, my friend?
[Paulina chuckles nervously]

This is Jimmy. This is Caroline...

Joanna... and Paulina.

And, um, there is a fourth one
wandering about somewhere

in search of her inner
consciousness or something.

Well, well, well, James,
aren't you full of surprises?

Actually, not.

I knew the second I saw 'em
get off that boat down there.

These your kids.
They also said Dad.

[sisters laugh]
Well, that was a good call.

Anyway, it's nice to meet you girls.

I am just floored that my Dad
knows Jimmy Ray Love.

Yeah. Well...

it's actually just the opposite of that.

I'm honored to know your dad,
call him my friend.

Everybody on this island will
tell you the exact same thing.

"Tell Me That You Love Me."
I love that song so much.

Me too. I love it too.

Yes. Well, here's to...

legendary songs
sung by legendary singers.

Yes.
Legendary songs.

Yeah.
Cheers.

[Caroline giggles]

[fire crackling]

["Time" begins]

[song continues]

[gentle country music playing]

Joanna! Joanna!

Oh...
Morning!

For God's sake, Caroline. I was asleep.

Oh, well, now you're awake. [chuckles]

What do you want?

Wasn't last night wonderful?

Well, yeah, if you don't
have a massive hangover.

Oh. It's so lovely here.
I can see why Dad enjoys it.

You know, Caroline,
I will pay you anything

if you just let me go back
to sleep for an hour.


Oh.

Another glorious day in paradise.

Hello, Dad. Nice to see
that somebody's up and at it.

Yes. Well, this is your first day
and your introduction to the island.

First up, a boat ride on a catamaran.

Ooh.
A catamaran?

Yes, it's a multihull boat.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Caroline.

I know what a catamaran is.

But if I'm gonna go out
under this burning orb,

I'm gonna need to borrow some sunscreen.
I didn't have time to buy any.

I have some in my cabin,
just help yourself.

I'm gonna go out and get some coffee.
We leave in one hour.

Time to get dressed. Chop-chop.

I hate you.

[drawer opens]

[drawer closes]


Oh, my...

[birds chirping]

[sighs heavily]


A few months ago,
I was feeling very tired.

I had them run some tests,
and it turned out I had cancer.

Does Jackie know?
No. I never told her. I...

I didn't want her to be around,
not to see any of this.

Dad, you need to get treatment.

You can't stay here. You... you have
to come home with us.

No.

I'm not doing chemo.

I'm not gonna waste away
on some hospital bed in London.

I'm gonna deal with this
on my own terms...

watching the sun rise and set, right here.

Listen to me.

I need you to promise me something.

I need you to swear
that you will not tell your sisters.

I can't do that.
Yes, you can.

Let me enjoy these couple
of days with my beautiful daughters.

Do this for me.

Let this be my Christmas present.

Please.
It's a lot to ask.

I know.

But I believe I can trust you
to make that promise.

Yes?

Okay.

[sniffles]
Now, don't we have a...

boat ride in a couple of minutes?

I...


I love you.

I love you more.


[James sighs]

[seagulls squawking]


[both chuckle]

You certainly kept that one quiet.

You really are a man of mystery,
Mr. Christmas.

Well, not really, Megan.

[Megan chuckles]

You see, honestly, I carry a bit of shame
about my daughters

which lasted until they forgave me
just last Christmas.

Several years ago, my wife fell in love
with my older brother.

I'm sorry.
Yeah.

And rather than having them
watch me self-destruct, I...

I left them.

Well, they are here now.

And they must love you very much.

[scoffs, chuckles]

Megan seems like a nice person.

Mm-hmm.

But?
But what?

Well, usually when you make
that noise, there's a "but."

No, not at all. But...
There you are.

Don't you think it's just
a little too soon after Jackie?

If Dad wants to have fun,
he should have fun.

It's none of our business.

Who are you,
and what have you done with Joanna?

[chuckles softly]

I still think we should find out
more about her, though.

Start digging.
Why is it always me?

Because you look so sweet and innocent,
and nobody suspects you.

Wow.

Some light, huh? [chuckles]
Another wonderful day.

So, Megan, are you and my Dad together?

Oh, my God! I can't
believe she just asked that.

[fake laughs]
No, we're not.

Megan and I are
just friends, Paulina.

Friends are good.

Happy now?
[light chuckle]

And what about you, Paulina?

Joanna and Caroline seem happily married.

Oh, I'm... I'm single. And I'm a lesbian.

Ah.

How about you, Megan?

Well, my parents aren't around anymore.

But even though I'm alone,
I could never leave the island.

Nevis is my home.

So, no husband then?

No. But I have been in love.

You know, before this interrogation
gets any sillier, I'm going swimming.

Hang on to that for me, will you?

[laughs loudly]
Yes, he is...

Oh, he really is.
Oh! [laughs]

[laughing]
Aw...

Come on in, girls! This is amazing.

[contented sigh]

[seagulls squawking]

[cheering and applause]

["Where'm I Gonna Live" begins]

Y'all sing it now!

[song continues]

Whoo!



[cheering continues]

[sentimental music playing]

[crickets chirping]

[waves rolling in]

It was quite an eventful day.

Yes. Dad, thank you so much.

Well, thank Megan.

She put together the best parts.

I have an idea.

Why don't y'all share one of your favorite
Christmas memories with us?

Um...

Yeah, I have one.

I'd love to hear it.

I was five, I think.

I was rooting around
Dad's record collection.

All these wonderful old vinyls.

And I closed my eyes,

and I pulled out a random album.

When I opened them,

it was Tamia Motown's
<i>Christmas Greats.</i>

And I put the record on,
and Dad came in

and he caught me dancing
to the Jackson Five,

singing "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town."

He was laughing his head off.

And when I was done...

he gave me the album to keep.

My first ever record.

I still have it.

What about you, Megan?

Ah, I'm not really one for reminiscing.

Oh, come on. You must have
one memory to share.

Well...

I do remember one Christmas Eve

when my father was helping my mother
put up the Christmas tree,

and he suddenly just stopped
and kissed her.

I never knew anyone
to kiss with so much love as they did.

[sighs] Your turn, Caroline.
[Joanna] Oh, no.

Don't open Pandora's box.

Oh, stop it. It's easy.

Last Christmas.

After being away for 15 years,

Dad came back,
and we were a family again.

And it was crazy and chaotic...

but it was perfect.

Joanna.

My favorite Christmas memory...

You don't have to say it, Joanna.

Oh, but I do.

It was snowing.

Mum had taken the other girls
to the Christmas fair,

leaving just me and Dad home together.

So, we snuggled up and we watched
a Christmas movie on TV.

Then Dad said,

"Get your coat and gloves.

We're gonna go out and build
a snowman for your sisters."

I was so excited, and we built
the biggest snowman ever.

Then Dad picked me up and he said...

Do you remember what you said?

I said I would always
love you and protect you...

and I would never, ever leave you.

That's right. You know what, Dad?

You never did leave me.

You were with me every minute...

of every day of my life.

What about you, Jimmy Love?

For real?
[Paulina] Yeah.

My favorite Christmas memory...

this one.

Watching y'all be the family I never had.

[soft melodious music playing]

[toilet flushes]

[sentimental music playing]

[birds chirping]

Morning, Daddy.


Oh, I want to make the most of this trip.

What's the plan for today?

Let's start with some breakfast.

[cozy festive music playing]

I'm stuffed.

Is this you or me?
You.

Ah.

Good morning, Mr. Christmas.
Good morning, Vanessa.

You didn't forget me, right?
How could I forget you?

If you've finished breakfast, shall we?

We shall, indeed.
Where are we going?

Come along, girls. Vanessa
runs a program for kids.


How old is <i>she?</i>

["O Christmas Tree" big band version
playing throughout]

So, we bake the cookies.

And then we deliver them to the older
people in our community

who can't go out and shop
for themselves anymore.

We do this because...


I'm sorry, children...
I... I've gotten so old I...

I can barely hear what you're saying.
Would you mind repeating that, please?

Sharing is caring!

Eh?


[all laughing]


Go ahead, Leo.

Is your last name really Christmas?

Yes. My name is James Christmas.

Do you know Santa personally?

I'd have to say that Santa and I

have a very special bond.

I hope he likes our Christmas cookies.

Oh, I'm sure he will, Jackson.

Well, kids, I think
we should say a huge thanks

and a big applause to Mr. Christmas!

[kids] Yeah!
Thank you, Mr. Christmas!

Thank you. Thank you, children.

Now we gotta go deliver these cookies,

and I tell you what. Cenita, Jackson,
Christian, Leo, you come with me.

Caroline, you will ride shotgun.

Come on, kids. Let's get ready
to deliver these cookies.

[kids chatter excitedly]

[kids giggling]

Good, kids. Good job. Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Go ahead up the stairs, kids.
Give them cookies.

There you go.
[woman] Merry Christmas.

Thank you, thank you.

They're so pretty. Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

Oh, this is lovely.
[coughing]

Dad, you okay?

What's up?

Suddenly, I don't feel very good. Uh...

Would you mind driving home?

No, of course. You don't look very well.

[dog barking]
[birds chirping]

[sentimental music playing]

I... I just need to rest a little.

I probably ate something bad.


You're burning up a little.

They're good kids, aren't they?
Yes. Yes, they are.

You know, I never ever
meant to hurt you, Caroline.

You do know how much
I love you and your sisters, don't you?

Of course.

I, uh, need to lie down.
I'm gonna take a nap. [sniffles]

We can, uh,
have some dinner tonight.

Okay. Get some rest.

[breathes heavily]

What's going on?

I don't know. Something's up.

We were delivering cookies,
and everything was fine,

and then he started coughing,
and he has a fever.

He's resting.

What is it, Joanna?

Nothing.
You're lying.

What? Why is she lying?

She knows something. Spit it out.

I can't. I made a promise.

What promise?

Joanna. Tell us.


Okay. Yeah.

Let's... let's go sit down.

Well?

Dad has cancer.

You're not serious?

I'm not gonna joke
about something like this, am I?

No, no, of course not, but...

When? How?

Caroline, what are you doing?
I'm calling Vicky.

No, no, no, no, no.
I mean, she has to know.

I have to call her.
No, she has to know!

Please stop! Our Daddy is sick.


I can't believe this.
When did you find out?

Yesterday. But he made me promise
not to tell you both.

He just wants to enjoy
this time with his daughters.

Well, obviously Jackie doesn't know,
otherwise she'd be here.

What are we gonna do?

Look, you two have to behave
as if you don't know.

What?
[Joanna] Please.

I promised.

We can't just ignore the fact
that he's sick, finish our little vacation

and wave goodbye
for the last time. Can we?

Absolutely not.

Here's what we're going to do.
We're gonna keep his secret.

But the three of us have to do
everything we possibly can

to show him how precious he is to us.

And we have to convince him
to come back to England with us

so he can get treatment
and we can take care of him.

Agreed?

Agreed.
Agreed.

Okay, we have a mission to accomplish.

Absolutely. Of course we do.

Father Christmas
is not dying on our watch.

[phone ringing]

Hi, darling.
Hey. Hi, sweetheart.

How's my little girl?

<i>Oh, she's fast asleep.</i>

<i>You okay?</i>

Not really.
What's wrong?

It's Dad.

He's got cancer.

Oh, no.

Oh, honey.

<i>Babe, I'm so sorry.</i>

<i>You are gonna bring him home, right?</i>

I'm not sure.

Look...

Honey, um...

anything you need,

I'm here for you, okay? I love you.

I love you too.
Kiss that little baby for me.

<i>Of course.</i>

<i>I'm gonna go. I don't really feel like
talking now, but...</i>

I'll call you later, okay?

Okay. Love you.

Lots of love. Bye.
[phone beeps off]

[sighs]
[sentimental music playing]

[phone ringing and vibrating]

[phone beeps]

Yeah?
Hey, my brother.

Hey, Jimmy. How are you, man?

What are you and your girls doing tonight?

I don't think we have anything planned.
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

Why don't you let me treat
y'all to a big dinner down at Sunshine's?

Maybe some of that house rum
of his, if you know what I'm saying?

Well, that's awfully nice of you.

<i>It might be a nice way
to send the girls off.</i>

Okay, then. Well, I'll see you
when you get here.

We'll see you later. Thanks.

Do you ever run out
of amazing places here?

It's incredible.
What are these?

It's a homemade rum,
made with a secret ingredient.

What secret ingredient?
Sunshine.

Oh.
[laughs]

It's called a Killer Bee.

You gotta be careful,
they're dangerous and addictive.

Here's to Killer Bees
and the island of Nevis.

Killer Bees!

Nevis.
[all] Nevis.

There's Sunshine now.
[Joanna] Hey, there.

We're gonna need
some more Killer Bees.

More Killer Bees be right up.

Thank you.
[Jimmy] Thank you, sir.

Be right back with your food.
[all] Thank you.

Thank you, sir. Well done.

Well, seems like
y'all know a lot about me,

so how about I learn
a little bit about you all?

Carolina, is it true you live
in a castle?

Oh, that old thing.

But really, it just was passed down
through my husband's family.

You know, 16th century,
go off, fight a war,

come back, get a castle
for your troubles.

Joanna, what about you?

Oh, well, I am a fashion editor.

And I'm also mummy
to a beautiful little girl.

Now, you and this Janis thing.

If it's just a phase,
it's working for you.

And if you gonna be somebody,
be Janis, I always say.


Oh, you didn't see her
during her Beatles phase.

She had a mop top for a long time.

It was only for 10 years, Caroline.

When I was a little girl,

I fell in love with The Beatles,
especially Paul.

And when I grew up, I chose to do
my thesis on them.

I consider myself
a bit of a method writer.

I like to live in their style, you know?

I think it helps the process.

[sentimental music playing]

Cheers. To the process.
Very proud of you.

[Joanna] Cheers.
[Caroline] Whoo.

[Jimmy] Whoa.
[Joanna] Oh, wow.

[Jimmy] Sunshine.
[Joanna] Look at that.

Yes, I am.
Yum.

Oh, Dad.

[Caroline] Good night.
[James] Night, Jimmy Ray.

Good night, girls, James!

How you feeling, Dad?
Great. I'm content.

I have my three girls
with me. [chuckles softly]

I do get it, you know.
What's that?

The pull of this place.
It's like paradise.

I think I had too many Killer Bees.

[Joanna chuckles]

You know what? I miss Vicky.

Oh, I know. I tried calling her, but she
answers her phone like once a month.

Well, let's send her a video message,
the four of us.

Oh.
That's a good idea.

Paulina, you will be the cameraman.
Yeah. I have my phone.

[Caroline] Okay.
Okay.

[phone beeps]
Go.


Hi, hun.
We miss you.

Listen. I... I miss you,
sweetheart, every day.

And I... I just want to say,
you know, be safe, and I...

I want you to have a wonderful life.

I love you.

We love you.
We love you.

Stay safe.
[all] Bye. Bye.

[phone beeps]
Sent.

Oh, yes. You know
what you should do, Dad?

You should come back
to England with us

and have Christmas there.
[in unison] Yes.


I... the weather
does not agree with me.

It's not that bad.

Don't you want to have
Christmas with us, Daddy?

Well, then, I'll do one better.

Why don't we all stay
and have Christmas here?

[gasps] Yes!
Yes?

Oh, we could bring everyone out.
Peter and the Kids.

Uh, Felix and Chloe.

Yes. And Vicky and Mum and Uncle John.
[Caroline] Yes.

All right, all right.
Let's not get carried away.

Caroline, don't go changing
your Christmas traditions.

I know how important they are to you.

No. Come on, Caroline can
live dangerously for one year,

can't you, Caroline?
Yes. Yes, yes, I can.

Come on, Dad. Say yes.

May I sleep on it?
Okay.

I'm going to bed. Good night, ladies.
Yeah, all right.

[Caroline and Joanna] Good night.
[Paulina] Good night, Dad.

What do we think?

I don't know.

I don't want to lose my Daddy.

[crickets chirping]

You told them.

They're your daughters, Dad.
They needed to know.

Why don't you go sleep on that?

Good night.

Good morning, ladies.
Morning.

Where's my Dad?

Your father left you this note.

Thank you.

"Meet me here." And an address.

Oh, gosh.

[vehicle approaching]

[door closes]

What is this place?
I bought it.

I'm thinking about slapping
a fresh coat of paint on it.

Best view on the island,

and that rhythm is just perfect.

Now, if you three would kindly be seated,

I have something to explain to you.

[sentimental music playing]

This thing I have, this cancer.

It's in my head.
It's called a meningioma.

It started with headaches and dizziness,
a couple of blackouts.

They have to monitor its growth.

When it reaches a certain size,
the only option is to operate.

If and when that happens,
I will have to decide what to do.

If I choose to do that,

then I will decide
where to have the operation.

Until then, I am staying here.

So you slept on our suggestions
and ignored them.

I want you to go back to your families...

and to your dreams.

And it is not because I don't love you,

it's because I want you
to remember me like this.

It's not fair.

You know perfectly well you would get
much better treatment at home,

with all of us around you.

How could you do this to us?

I do not want you
to change your life for me.

And more importantly,

I do not want you to watch me fade away.

I will not allow it.

That's why you will be getting
on that plane in the morning.

That's why you left Jackie, isn't it?

Yes.

Jackie is a vibrant,
beautiful young woman.

Her time is better spent elsewhere.

So, you're basically just pushing away
everybody who's ever loved you.

It's so selfish!


It's not fair.

You can't just ask us
to leave, just like that.

"Bye, Dad. See you at your funeral."


Cancer is treatable.

And I waited so long
to have you back in my life,

and now I'm going to lose you again,
but this time forever.


You're not gonna lose me. I promise.

Oh. Hello, Leo.

Hi, Mr. Christmas.
I have a question for you.

Go ahead.

Would you please be my instructor
for my sailing class today?

Of course.

Is it okay if I bring
my daughters along too?

Okay.
Very well then.

See you soon.

Mm-hmm. Bye.

[upbeat music playing]

I heard you are leaving the island soon.


You know...

they want the children on the island

to love and respect the water

as much as they love
and respect each other.

Yeah.

Yeah, I can see that.

[upbeat music continues]

You have to keep the boat straight.

I know. I'm trying.
Just has a mind of its own.

Ooh. Oh! We're getting it,

we're getting it! [chuckles]

Am I doing okay?
Yes, you're doing great.

Then why are you staring at me?
Your eyes are beautiful.

You look like a princess to me.

Oh, sweetheart. You're the princess.

[giggles]
Come on.

Mr. Christmas, can I ask you something?

Do you have a girlfriend?

Tough question, Leo.
What makes you ask such a thing?

My Mom was wondering.
I heard her asking her friend.

I see.

So, do you have one?

Uh... I, uh... Well...

Mom! Mr. Christmas
doesn't have a girlfriend!

Where's your dad, Leo?

Gone. My parents are divorced.

I think you'd make a great dad.

Well, that's...
That's very kind of you, Leo.

Uh, why don't we just
focus on the sailing for now, huh?

Okay.
You ready to come about?

Yep!
[groaning]

It's obvious, right?

[sentimental music playing]

Yes.

Yes, it is.

[soft chuckle]

[sad chuckle]


Well done. Give yourselves a hand.

Now, listen up, you squabs,

I'm buying each and every
one of you some ice cream.

On me, let's go!
[kids] Yay!

Get that ice cream.

[sentimental music playing]

Paulina.

How is it possible to feel so sad
and so happy at the same time?

I've never felt like this before.

None of us have.

[wind blowing]

but look at that view.

You don't get a view like
that in London, do you?


[chuckles softly]

What about you, Megan?
You ever been to London?

A few times.

I really love the energy,
but it's a little too busy for me.

Everyone has their favorite place,

but it's often accompanied
by their favorite person.

Hmm. Don't you agree, Dad?

If you're in your perfect place,
it's best to be with somebody you love?


There's no point being in paradise
if you've no one to share it with.

Yes. Quite.

What about you, little sister?
Have you been enjoying the sights?

Very much. Very much indeed.

[phone ringing]
Oh.

Excuse me, everyone.

Hang on. Hello? Hello?

Hang on.

Hello? Hang on a sec.

Let me just get better reception.
Hang on.

Hey.

<i>Hi, honey. Hi.</i>

really cold here right now.

Oh. Well, this might warm you up.

Oh, that is amazing. Wow.

<i>So, is your dad coming home?</i>

No, actually.

No?

<i>Yeah, he's bought himself this...</i>

beautiful little beach house

and he's gonna stay right here.

That's a pity.

Anyway, I've got
some great news for you.

<i>Your old boss Michael,
he called this morning.</i>

<i>He wants you to be chief editor
of the new magazine he's launching!</i>


Really!

<i>Honey.</i> [laughs]

This is everything you ever wanted.

Yeah. Yeah, it is.

I can feel a "but" coming.

[church bell ringing]
[crickets chirping]

You know, when I came
to this island years ago...

I don't think I believed in anything.

Now, I believe in everything.

Most of all, the miracle of Christmas.

[choir vocalizing]

[playing "Silent Night" on guitar]

<i>â™ª Silent night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Holy night â™ª</i>

[song ends]

Merry Christmas, everybody. God bless you.

Thank you, Jimmy Ray Love,

for that moving rendition
of this sacred song.

There is no more beautiful time
of the year than Christmas.

We are three days away
from the birth of a child

that completed the most
holy of families.

And that is what I want
to talk to you about tonight...

Family.

We are all the product
of a father and a mother.

And no matter the circumstances
of our birth,

we all breathe in the miracle of life

and the goodness of God.

You may travel to a faraway place,

you may have dreams

that take you along an unknown path,

you may find love there, or hope...

but you never let go
of the memories of family

that lies locked here in your heart.

You never let go of the love
you have for them.

And even when we get older,

we cherish and hold on to the memories
that we share with one another.

And those memories, we hope,
will never fade away.

So, I would like you to join hands
as one family tonight,

under the moon and the stars,

and give thanks for our families,

and pray that we never let them go.

Amen.
[all] Amen.

Amen.

Brother Love?

Amen!
[all] Amen!

[crickets chirping]
[footsteps approaching]

I feel a lot of change coming on, James.

What do you mean?

I guess you could call it
this old country boy's intuition.

[James] Fancy a walk?
Sure.

walks with my granddad years ago. Yeah.

[Jimmy] Down to the liquor store?
No, sir.

You three look like you're up to no good.

Dad, you know that call
I had earlier with Felix?

Well, I heard that I've been
offered my dream job...

A fashion publisher.

That's wonderful. Congratulations.

But I'm not gonna take it.

But it's your dream job.

I am gonna move here for a year.


With Felix and Chloe.

And don't even try
to make me change my mind.

You've always taught us
to follow our dreams,

and... my dreams changed.

I want you to get to know
your granddaughter.

And I really want her to know you.

And live with you for a while.

I don't know what to say.

I think it's a wonderful idea.
You should be happy, Dad.

I am happy, especially to meet
my new granddaughter.

Being with those kids
today just made me realize

that that's the sort of life
I want for my daughter.

And we're going to visit too.
Peter's thrilled at the idea.

Of course, I am going to have
to stock up on sunscreen,

because he's almost as pale as I am.

And what about you?

Do you have some reason
for returning to the island

other than to see your dear old dad?

Let's just say I have my reasons.

[James] Ah.
Hmm.

Hmm.

You're sure about this?

Yep.
Yes, we are.

Hmm.

Family need to stick together. Agreed?


You girls...

Yes, I agree.

Merry Christmas! [chuckles]
[all] Yay!

[all laughing]

okay until we get back?

I promise. Everything will be fine.

I'm sure Chloe's going to love it here.

I'm so proud of you.

It seems someone has come
to say goodbye to the real Paulina.

What?

She's waiting for you.

[chuckles softly]

So this is what the real Paulina
looks like.

Yes. Sorry.

It's not quite as dramatic as Janis,

or the Beatles, for that matter.

I wanted to give you something.

Thank you.

I'll be waiting for you.

I have to go.

[James chuckles]


Well, it's time to say goodbye.

Come on, let's have a hug.

Love you.
Love you too.

Have a good trip.

We'll see you soon. [chuckles]
[Paulina] Bye.

[uplifting music playing]

[boat engine revving]
[James chuckles]

Off they go. And floor it.


Bye!

[James chuckles]
That was pretty great.

It'll be okay.
Yes, I know.

I can't believe we're leaving Dad.
I know.

It was a really special time.

I love you.

[phone ringing]
Oh!

It's Jackie.
Why is she calling?

Jackie? No, we just left him.

What?! No!

What?
No!

We have to go back!
Why?!

We have to go back! Turn around!

Why?
We have to go back!

Why?! Turn the boat around!

What?!
[Paulina] Turn the boat around!

What are they doing?



[both continue yelling excitedly]


Dad! Dad!

What?
What?

Jackie called. She's pregnant!


You're going to be
Father Christmas again!

Oh, boy.

[all squeal and laugh]

[Joanna] Daddy!
[indistinct chatter]

Look at you. Oh, my God.

Maybe we'll have a boy this time.

No!

[uplifting music playing]
