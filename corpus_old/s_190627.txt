Why don't we watch TV?

You're originally
one of those on the screen

But you won't be the winner

You... why do you catch me here?

Your figure is not so good

Don't you wanna be the Princess?

I'll see if you can meet my standard

My figure is already good enough

What do you want me to do?

Don't bother me

To leave here, you have one only way

Your weight must be below 70 pounds!

Cherrie

You scared me, Hong

You're going out for a meal in the rain?

They forgot to buy it for me

Have you had it yet?

Yes. They've been finding you

Damn Hurry up

What? You let Sisi go on stage first?

I won't go on stage tonight

What should I do then?
Somersault or Muay Thai?

Don't be angry
You're the planned Princess

She's a clown. You're a star

She's much worse than you

And once you go on stage

no one will ever remember her

Look, she really performs Muay Thai

I've seen miss Sisi's resume

She's one of
the best Muay Thai players in HK

Really cool

Powerful punches

Cherrie!

Where have you gone?

Go get the clothes for Queenie

Yes...

Is it okay? Is it okay?

Sisi. Great, Sisi

Should have some tricks
to entertain people

Queenie, the next one is you

What?

It's your turn

Why don't you say it earlier?

Don't put your dirty stuff everywhere

My skirt worths $50,000
You can't afford to pay

Queenie! Get away!

Why so many people?

Why always block my way?

What monkey show do you wanna play now?

Go see the physician

Take care

You look so ugly putting these clothes on

And you'll probably get a cold soon

Who are you talking about?

Of course is you. Need to say it again?

Save the money. You can't get cured

So late?

That lady told me
to change the clothes again. So tired

No

Let's go and eat something

Sorry. I gotta remove the makeup
for Queenie later

You're not her assistant

just her fitness coach

Miss Kong told me to look after Queenie

Leave her alone. Let's go

Have a meal together No...

Let's go

I don't want her misunderstood it

The contest now reaches the climax

Tonight's Princess
of Weight Watcher is...

No. 12, Miss Fei Tong!

Calm down. Put down your knife

Don't kill me. No!

It's totally useless killing him

You're so pretty and have a bright future

Shouldn't get in jail for this pervert

My husband's never a pervert

You bitch!
Say it again or I'll slash him!

No... don't do that. Cool it...

Dare let him go
and fight with me with a knife!

I'm not that stupid

You come and I'll slash him!

Stay calm...

Who'll be the Queen
of Weight Watcher tonight?

Louder!

Louder Cool it...

Hold on!

Turn up the television's volume!

Alright...

No. 10, Queenie

I guessed it would be her

Sure... these are all setups

How about turning it off?

Okay...

Butt out!

You dare to hit my husband!

I like to do it

Actually all of you're right...

Let's sit down and talk

He is right? He didn't divorce his wife

He said he'd buy me a flat
but it's a lie

You son of a bitch!

Oh no

You can't promise what you can't to women

A man always makes promise
when he's on the bed

You're right Butt out!

Miss, put down your knife

Or he'll easily get hurt

If you hurt him, we can do nothing...

but accuse you of damaging others

Better find a social worker to solve it

I'll shoot you dead and shoot myself

Come one

Have negotiation specialists come?

Have they come?

Have negotiation specialists come?

Come to die!

Let him go, or I'll shoot you
and shoot myself

Have you opened the safety lock?

Help me do it

Your hand that held the gun
is still shivering

Give me the cigarette

You'll see if your wife knows you smoke

Therefore I smoke now. Give me

Treasure the happy times, fat guy

Yes, sir

I'll be more careful next time

Next time?

You go first
I'm gonna write the report

No. Last time you wrote
so many wrong words

And I was blown up

Let me do it myself

Bastard! Crying for a whole night

Doesn't seem like water

That guy won't get home so early

It's better, though. Won't bother me

You forgot it? I can't take the pill

Or I'll be as fat as a pig

He can't use condom. He's allergic to it

No

I won't have baby. It's so painful

I'd rather live without children

I can only refuse him every time

He's back. Talk to you later

Many things to do

Darling, I'm back

I'm loaded. See how cool it is!

Don't pretend to be sleeping

Deeper breath means you're sleeping?

You snore while sleeping
Don't you know?

I'm telling you now...

No... I'm really sleeping

I'm very sleepy. Don't...

1, 2, 3, 4

What do you mean?

You know why
I am not in the safe period today

I'll be busy when you're in safe period

Then use the condom

I'm allergic to condom! How to use?

So let's sleep earlier

We have... not that staggering

2 months
We haven't done it for 2 months

Are you calculating this kind of stuff?

Did you marry me just for this?

No...

I gave up working as superintendent
just for you

You know how much I sacrificed?

If I went on I'd be the commissioner soon

You... do you wanna do what I did today?

Listen. Today

I was forced to turn on TV

Then they took my gun
and then they pissed me

Do you wanna do what I did today?

How come you speak so loud?

You're annoyed so you blow me up!

I speak loudly? You speak so loud first

Isn't it loud?

Alright, let me find a girl
with lower voice

Go ahead

You petty guy aren't willing
to treat them a cup of tea

Who wanna know you?

Sure. Who wanna know me?

I'm not petty. I'm a saver

It's virtue. Kindness

Alright... you're so kind
and have virtue...

How about...

sleeping outside?

What? I can't hear it clearly

You sleep outside

Listen. I will not sleep
outside the bedroom!

What's up?

Superiors have decided
to transfer Inspector Ma

He's gone and you should get promoted

I don't care

Promotion means salary up
but benefits cut

and take the blame for others. Let it go

Don't say it this way, sir

We're more confident if you get promoted

Talk about it later

Yes sir

What? Got crazy just when you got up?

No. Just have a morning dance

Let's dance together. Come on

No. I gotta go to the toilet

Good morning... Good morning...

How are you? Fine, thanks

You look so fine, Tak

Sure. Nice sleep last night

Thank you

Good morning...

Come here, Tak
Something to talk with you

Yes, sir

You already knew that Ma is transferred?

No... why do I know?

Coz he made a serious mistake

This post is still empty

One must lead 3 teams

It's vital Yes...

And in these 3 teams...

You're the most experienced one

So I hope you'll work hard...

Yes, sure...

to work for your new boss

New boss...

He's called William, former HQ member

He's a Dr. In criminal psychology

Are you okay?

You look shocked

Good. Good idea

Criminal Psychology... Dr., good

You gotta have a chat with him

Sir, I'm going if nothing special

Tak, one more thing

A reporter of a pop magazine in Mainland

comes to HK to take some info

I want you to help him
He's called Tin Fuk

The paparazzi are so mad

I won't work with him if he's one of them

I don't know. Just helping him will do

Which bastard thinks of this bullshit?

My wife! That's her nephew

So... your wife... so let me help him...

Tell him to find me, sir

I never force you, do I?

No... you don't...

Good morning...

What? How impolite

Sorry, sir. Got the wrong info

Doesn't matter. I won't blame you

More relaxed, Even better

You looked so glad...

It doesn't matter...

Give me a pair of gym shoes!

Reporting. Inspector Wong of CID has come

Inspector Wong

Give way, please...

Cheung... how long has he died?

Damn. Cheung hasn't died

Ask the coroner, you fool

Sir, where's Tak Wong in CID?

The 3rd floor upstairs

Thank you very much

Tak, 2 men find you Who?

One old-fashioned and one cool

Okay, thanks

Good morning, Tak... Good morning...

Are you Tak Wong?

Wait a second

Welcome... You're Tak Wong, right?

Sure. Just call me Tak

With your leadership...

I believe we'll have a huge progress

Thanks... I'm here to learn from you

You're welcome...

We're hardworking staff

Just a bit lack
in newest technologies and theories

This way...

This is your room

Do you mind calling you William?

I don't mind, but...

But I like to call myself Tin Fuk

Tin Fuk...

So you're Tin Fuk?

Yes, who do you think I am?

Nothing... I thought you're Tom Cruise

What can I do for you?

Let me introduce myself

I'm a reporter of Unveil in Mainland

Investigating a man
suspected of sexual abuse in Shanghai

He works in HK and the victim was killed

We'd like HK police to find him for us

Yes, this is Ken

You're Tak Wong? Who are you?

William, William Hung

Nice to meet you William Hung

This is Tin Fuk, right?

Come into my room

Can you give me a cup of milk tea?

Thanks

This is Ken

Suspected of a sexual abuse case
in Shanghai last year

He held an actress
into the dungeon for 15 days

giving her nothing to eat

The lady ran out
and reported to the police

The police then arrested Ken

But in the court
the girl refuted her own statements

Ken is then acquitted of a charge

We believe Ken gave her
a lot of money in advance

making her refute
the statements on purpose

How about now?

Ken's found to have moved...

and is flirting
with a lady boss of a beauty company

We gotta know
if he's any link with this case

We'll help you as much as we can

But there's a strange murder case
here today

How strange?

It's famished

Famished?

What's up, Luck?

The dead's stomach
and throat was seriously hurt

Too much stomach acid...

Causes it to flow back

She's believed to have eaten very few...

and drunk so little when she's lost

I think it's the cause of death

Observing the hair follicle...

it may have stayed in a place
with high temperature

leading to dehydration of the body

And now she have 70 pounds left

70 pounds?

Yes, 70 pounds

One interesting finding

Her mouth was stuffed
with a piece of paper

What's that?

Have you been to the supermarket?

It's the price tag calculating the weight

Psycho

Many killers with abnormal psychology
in US act like this

They think they can control everything

They control the dead's body and behavior

Once they've succeeded
they'll probably do it again

You mean he'll break the law again?

Work or it'll happen again. Go

Can I work with you, Tak?

Can he work with us, sir?

No problem

Thank you

You haven't even lost a catty these weeks

Have you referred to the menu?

I'm already 120 pounds. It's alright

But our aim is 113 pounds

Just editing the pics
in the computer is ok

Have you drunk any alcohol?

Mind your own business

But our contract says
that you can't drink, and...

can't take medicines
not prescribed by a doctor

Get out...

Piss off!

I got it

Miss Kong, I'm gonna quit

Do you know Ivy is dead?

How come?

The police have just been
to Forever Beauty

They'll come just then. Go prepare it

But Queenie's attitude...

Okay... talk with me tomorrow. Go

The cops are coming
You gotta go... from back door

Who are you looking for, sir?

Hello, I'm Inspector Tak Wong

I'm gonna discuss a murder case
with your boss, miss Kong

What's wrong with the alarm?
Who opens the back door?

Sorry, sir. I gotta check the back door

Just sit down and tell me
where the door is

Over there

I'm going with you, sir

Just sit down here, sit down

Let him go... what a trouble...

Anything happened?

Sorry, miss

Don't take it...

So you've come here now?

That is Ken, isn't it?

Sorry... sorry...

Scared me

What a hit!

Lucky that I'm a policeman
If I were a wolf...

that's great

Bull

The one who ran is Ken

Ken? Who's he?

The one I'm looking for

Thank you very much

Call me if anything happens
Thank you...

You can call on me at any time
Thank you...

Sir...

Come on, talk something

Sir What's up?

What?

What to say in front of
2 senior barristers?

Just tell you their names

She said she's just
normal friends with Ken

They've been here so long
Ken's probably run

Still no Ken's departure record

I think he's still in HK

The cops have been finding you

Avoid them. Don't come out

You're back?

Still staying up?

You idiot. It's gonna be dawn now

Watching VCD

A housewife should watch VCDs

Or what else can I do?

What're you talking about?

A housewife has nothing to do
with other stuff but VCDs?

Go to sleep

Was that model really famished?
Yes

He must be a psycho

Of course. Dare to deny?

If he's not a psycho

can he do this kind of stuff? You...

He's not a psycho, I am

2 days later is ok. Is that good?

Keep your promise!

Go take a bath

According to criminal psychology

He left no traces in this action

It's so perfect. He must do it again

You mean he'll be mass murderer?

Yes

This kind of people
take killing as an art

They're usually nervous breakdown

lonely, and fleshless

How come? Why're they fleshless?

They usually forget to eat

which leads to malnutrition, so those...

who're fleshless can easily
be nervous breakdown

Nervous breakdown makes them even weaker

You think it like this?

What? It's not me

It's from a report
from Columbia University

What... what university?

Columbia University

Columbia University...

And they're not sociable

Hard for them to get along
with colleagues

Dreaming of being pursued every day

When did you read it?

When you're watching soccer matches

I thought you only know
how to put on makeup

According to criminal psychology...

The killer must be satisfied
with his performance

So he must act again

You study criminal psychology

Yes, I've just read a report...

from Columbia University

It says the fleshless people...

is easily be nervous breakdown

making them unable to eat

Unable to eat means they'll get weak

Get weak and be nervous breakdown

Nervous breakdown and they'll...

In a word, fleshless

You're so hard working. What a surprise

Yes, I love that...

Dr. Bin Laden

You've forgotten, honey

It's Dr. Shelton

Hello

Hello I am William

I'm Ling, Tak's wife

I worked as a police before

Really?

She worked here before

You're husband's good
in criminal psychology

Take a seat...

Take some food, thanks

Dr. Shelton

You study of criminal psychology, too

We women know nothing about it

It's my husband who tells me

He tells me when he's read the reports

He read a German
Dr. Ernest's report last week

His theories are similar to Dr. Shelton's

If you like them, I think you may even...

study the report written
by Robert. Ressler of FBI

I can lend it to you

Sure...

Honey. I'm here to tell you...

I've found an important clue

What is that?

Just discuss with us

The murderer is thin

If he dragged the 80-catty body
to the alley

He must need very much effort

So I believe...

the 1st crime scene is not far away
from the alley

And the body was not even
left traces of being dragged

Tak, I think we gotta set the boundary...

to the distance walking 5 minutes

from the alley

And we must keep an eye on the
spokespersons of Forever Beauty

Sisi and Fei Tong

I fear the killer will take them
as the next targets

How about this, director Chan

Fei Tong, you'll sit here...

So what'll I do then?

Eating

Eat again? Yes

Miss Si, Miss Lui

We're CID
We wanna record the statement with you

We're working, sir

It's about 10 minutes. Very quick

Let's finish these scenes first

Sir, how about asking you a question?

If correct
I'll record the statement right now

Is a dumpling masculine or feminine?

It's masculine. Why?

Coz it has phimosis!

Not funny? Sorry

Camera, action

Eat, and it will keep you young

Cut!

What's up?

I've played in the movie
for a whole month

Eating dumplings every day

Do I have any dialogue?

Haven't you seen the screenplay?

Speak when you have to. Now you don't

Eat'em! Hurry...

Sorry. Just kidding

Action!

No... director, I...

I gotta go to the toilet. I'm fed up

Need someone to go with you?

No. All human beings know
I master Muay Thai

Sometimes I'm even afraid of
my own ability

April

Don't be so passive

Feel dizzy once you see handsome guys?

What's up?

What happened?

Nothing, just gave a sigh

Crazy

Artists are all crazy

Sigh without reason. Crazy

Crazy again

What are you doing?

Playing Muay Thai

Nothing... I've eaten too many dumplings

Muay Thai can help digestion...

and keep the skin white

What's up, sir?

How about putting down your gun
and play it with me?

Not funny?

I'm going to the toilet. Bye!

Not yet. Can't wrap yet

Still long time to go

April

Do it 3 times?
Too bad if anyone marrying her

I'm a Mainland reporter
Can you give me an autograph?

I have interviews in HK

Mainland people also notice me!

I'm your fan

Help...

She's got trouble!

Are you okay?

Where's miss Si?

Somebody caught her...

Bull, tell all other spokespersons...

to stay in safe places and not to go out

Got it

You stay here I can help you...

Stay here!

Who?

I'm the cop who records
the statement this morning

It's you

Why hang up, Sisi? Got angry?

Sisi has trouble

Tell Queenie and other people
to stay in the Center

Queenie and I are in the Center
but the power is cut

I'm scared

Calm down. I'm coming

Lock the door and wait for me

Hurry, hurry...

I'm gonna see if Cherrie's fixed it

Goddamn! Stay with me!

It's me, Ken Is that you?

I'll let you go if you don't yell

Cherrie

Cherrie

I can only talk to you like this

Why are you here?

I wanna see you

Miss Kong misses you so much

We parted

You know I love you

The cops called me
and said they're coming

You gotta go

I won't go without you

If you do love me, listen to me. Go

What happened, Cherrie?

Don't play with me!

I won't go without you

You gotta go

Cherrie!

Are you okay?

Sure

Is it abduction?

Is it TV's funny program?

Are there many cameras shooting me?

Are you playing?

Then a host comes out and say I win

Give me car and house and something

Are you giving me anything?

No I don't want them. I just want money

$300,000 is enough. Stop it

Come out!

Do I look good? Where's my powder puff?

My powder puff's gone...

I gotta put on makeup!

I'm so scared...

Help me!

Let me go!

No problem

You meet my standard and you can go

Who are you? Where are you?

I can't see you

If you see me, you must die!

No... don't let me see you

I can't see you...

Let me go, please

You checked your weight, did you?

Yes...

Only 100 pounds. Thin enough

Not enough

You can go if you can be
70 pounds in a week

Did you kill Ivy?

She's just too weak to stand it

Don't kill me...

I can do whatever you want. No...
Okay

If you can make me laugh, you can go

When I was a child

I wanna be a model

but my career not good enough

Then I went to play comedies

Alright. If you can make me laugh
in 1 minute

I'll let you go

What does Bruce Lee like to say most?

Don't know? The answer is yelling

You know, when he fights
he says, Whatcha!

Yes. A riddle. Star Wars

Guess 2 objects

What's the 1st one?

It's jewel!

Jewel...

How about another one?

It's ball? Why?

Ball...

Not funny? Sorry...

Let me think...

Got it. You must laugh this time

Once upon a time...

What? Why do you laugh?

1 minute is over, idiot

No... this is really funny
Listen to me...

Once upon a time...

Listen to me!

This is really funny...

You don't need to send me home

This is our duty. No problem

Top floor? You gotta walk many stairs

Cheap rent, and I can take it as a sport

You can go now

Sorry, I really don't wanna come in

But I wanna go to the washroom. Can I?

Sorry, my home is a mess

Excuse me, the washroom...

Over there Thanks

Renowned spokesperson
of fitness company Sisi...

was help captive from the scene...

of Media Art at 3 am

Her assistant was hurt
and is now in the hospital

We'll now ask the chief inspector
Mr. Wilson Chow

Is this case related
to that case of Ivy last time?

We assume that the 2 cases...

Thank you

Are you okay?

Can I lean on your shoulder for a while?

Did you...
study in Pui Yin Secondary School?

Why do you ask it?

Because I did study there

You look weak...

but you got the gold medal
in shot put. Cool

It's about technique, not power

Technique? Really?

Which year did you graduate?

Did you ever see me in school?

No, I didn't
And which year did you graduate?

Maybe I didn't ever notice you

So many gals noticed me

I don't think so!

You finally laugh

Talk on phone later. Goodbye

Goodbye

Bull, where's Tak?

Wanna drink some soup?

Inspector Chow's scolding inside

What happened?

Sisi's dead, with legs chopped off

How come?

They said Sisi is just
70 pounds without legs

I said he'd do it again

Any traces found at the scene?

No

More perfect this time

Why's it become so big?

Sure. I can't get in charge of big deals

Do small stuff for the rest of my life

The case will be transferred
to Inspector Tit

Still pretending to be cool? How?

Tak

Your wife's come. Go have a chat

Come on... nothing

Have some soup

No appetite

It's just their business

Why're you so angry?

Damn it. Their business

I've been doing small jobs

Now it's getting bigger
and is then transferred

Aren't they pointing against me?

Why do they point against you?

You murderer!

You murderer!

When I hold a gun...

I feel frozen and can't say a word

Go tell the doctor

What? Doctor?

I'll get fired if other know it

I think it's work pressure

You still have many leaves
Better take some

No

I must catch that guy
red-handed this week

Or else I'll be a pawn
for the rest of my life

Excuse me, I wanna lose weight

Do you have many kinds of treatment?

Please introduce some

Can I help you, Mrs. Wong?

My pal said it costs
a lot for the 1st time

Need $100,000 or more?

Hello, my name's Cherrie
I'm the consultant

Are you Mrs. Wong?

Yes, I am

Take a bath and have a sauna

I'll give you treatment
on lymphatic system

Are there many renowned spokespersons?

I like stars so much

They often come
when there're few customers

Can you tell me
when they'll come? Thank you

I don't take tips

I'll try my best. Follow me

Thank you very much

The 1st victim is Ivy...

then Sisi the 2nd

If counting in fame

the least famous is Ivy

the next is Fei Tong

Honey

Wait... What?

Come on, in the middle...

Ready? Are you ready?

Sure

What? You brought me flowers

You... why're you so romantic suddenly?

Don't you remember? We'll do it tonight

I remember

Alright...

Wait... listen to me now...

We only talk about romance, not others

Okay, Talk for a whole night
after this...

Listen to me Put off your clothes...

Talk about this... No...

Wait... What?

Give me some time. It's quick

Okay... hurry up, hurry up...

I just thought
you'd take some underwear out

The people suspected in the case
Friend of Fitness...

Forever Beauty, 1, 2, 3, 4...

Good enough?

You reconstructed the case?

Cool. It's professional...

Better than the police. Look...

Look at the colors. Have all needed

It's so good to frame it here
Okay...

I know you're not admiring me

Kidding only. Kidding

Kidding? You've been looking down on me

It was really a joke

I'm not arguing with you tonight

Let's talk about romance. Take them away

You always think of these things

You know how much I've thought?

How much? You just wrote down...

These things... This is the truth

No... I really...

I shouldn't have said that, okay?

You always think I'm trash
I'm not...

You think I'm a fool!
What're you talking about?

I'm here not to argue with you...

I've spent so much time
but you just took a glimpse

Why are you so angry?

Look, what do you look like?

You idiot!

You hit me?

I'm gonna call the police

I don't wanna talk with you. Go out

What? What do you say?

I won't go out

I say I won't and I won't say it again

I'm lying here. See what you can do

Come on baby, come on

Don't trouble me!

You'll see

I'm back to mum's place

What should I do? I made her go

As a gentleman, I shouldn't act like this

She investigated the case. No big deal

She goes. What should I do?

Kick the bucket

What's wrong with investigation?

Just show her talent

Why acted on impulse?
Should apologize to her last night

Sorry, it's my fault

That'd be alright

It's seven years after we got married

We've gone through ups and downs...

Have you finished?

I've heard it. No need to be so loud

Sorry

Hide the necklace or you can't cheat me

I forgot. Too bad

Where do you go?

Go to lavatory and then mum's place

It's your mum's birthday?
You've dressed up

Just for your sincerity
let you off this time

You do?

You do?

What's the matter?
You do? Then I make it

What?

You agreed last night

It's just expired

Expired? This isn't the milk

I don't care about that. C'mon

This time no

No? No more excuse. C'mon

I've put on the necklace

Put it off

Why?

Why don't you put it off?
That'll bring bad luck

Why don't you put it off?

Put it off and open the door

Quiet

You can still put it off

Quiet, please

Can't imagine...
there're so many negative news...

but still
there're so many people coming here

The influence of media's really great?

There're 7 or 8 magazines
inviting them to take pix

Look. They don't eat nor sleep

How can they stand it?

You've worked for a long time
Take a break

I got to enjoy every moment
when I see Fei

Why don't you date her?

Why don't you have affair instead?

She and I are different

She looks perfect from this point

But she doesn't if I get closer

You have good imagination

Doesn't it sound good?

But you'd be disappointed

Paparazzi aren't entertaining

Those interviewees
either feel unhappy...

or hate us

Anyway we can't make them happy

Then you should change your job

You look smart. You can be an artist

Brad Pitt can't compare to you

Paparazzi?

They're from Pau Magazine

I knew them when doing reporting
of Pitt and Aniston

I drive them away

Don't... let them take pix

Yes

Yes

What? So awful

Got it

What's the matter?

Nothing. We got wind of the case

Ken's in a car dump. They go catch him

Let's go

Don't. Too many cooks spoil the broth

Back to the station
to see if they make it

Doing less is the best

What? Who's this?

Not sure. No number displayed

It must be those gals

It says Ken is in 103
Lai Ching Villa, Mau Shing Street

Need to tell Inspector Tit?

No. If these are fake then we're over

The team's gone. Don't tell him

So what should we do?

Let's go to see now

How about the gals? Right

You go and I stay here

Call me if anything happens
Give you a chance

No thanks

I have my wife

There's half an hour left

Last night...
didn't find you in the bulletin

Didn't you? I didn't

But I looked carefully

I found you look different

But I think you were more beautiful

Don't laugh at me

I think you're bushed
after working a couple of days

No I don't but I worry what's going on

Don't worry. I'll protect you

Sorry, we don't rent to a couple of men

CID

Sorry sir...

I'm so sorry...

Sorry... I'm so sorry...

Ken!

Ken! You can't run. Put your arms down

Don't go. Get back!

You murderer!

Repay my son's hatred!

Shit...

Are you okay?

How can you take us home
at the same time, sir?

Miss Lui...

Tell your assistant
to drive the car to get here

We follow your cars

My car's there and I drive it to get here

Thanks

When're you available? I buy you dinner

Sure

But...

don't tell anyone that I was ugly

You've told that?

No. Don't worry

It may be my car alarm. I go take a look

Stay in the car. Lock the car up

Start the engine and wait for me

Miss...

Miss!

He's been out so long
Does he have trouble?

We'd better go

Better wait for a while

Sure. Wait for a while

It's useless to wait

Let me go to see them

Go ahead, but I only wait 5 minutes

I'll drive away after 5 minutes

Okay

What's wrong with Bull?

How's Tin Fuk?

His arm and some ribs are broken
It isn't too serious

How about the gals?

Queenie and Fei are missing

Cherrie's in the room

I go have a look

Ling

I know her

Cherrie

It's you

I'm Tak's wife
He's responsible for this case

I went to Friend of Fitness...

just for any clues

Sorry

Take the murderer as soon as possible

Save Fei and Cherrie

We'll do our best. Don't worry

You should take a rest

But I'm so scared

It's so terrible

I'm so scared!

I understand

You can try to... sleep for a while

Have a sweet dream
Tomorrow's another day

Who is she?

Bull's mother

Is she okay?

Very sad

Sure

Me too

I know

The saddest thing is...

that I can't be too sad in front of her

If I'm too sad...

she may not be able to stand it

Bull has been working with me for years

He's been following me
when he entered CID...

Sorry, it's such a mess

What... this is a mess?

Thank you for going out with me

We're friends now

Do you have something to ask me?

What's the relationship
between you and Ken?

He's been seeking
after me but I refuse

And he hasn't given up

Does he give you money?

I don't get the money
I don't love him

Has he ever sought after other models?

I think not

Then he's quite devoted to you

We need you to save Queenie and Fei

He's been sending phone messages to me

But I never answer any

I got another one today

Meet in Hunghom station at 5 today

Lure him out

Team A, has the shop been open?

Yes but no customer

Team B, is the glass clean?

Clean

Team C, finished the breakfast?

Not yet

Keeping an eye on the kitten
She looks nervous

Team A got it Team B got it

Team C got it

The kitten's got a call

Should be SMS

Team B, have you seen the mouse?

Not yet...

Perhaps the SMS tells the kitten
where to dine out

Follow her?

Yes

Keep an arm's distance
Don't alert the kitten

Team A, any mouse?

No

The kitten gets off the car, Tak

It seems that she switches the place

What's she doing?

The kitten gets on the minibus
Follow her?

Wait a minute...

No minibus. Enter station
then go into tunnel

Shit! The mouse's found us

Team A, ambush the kitten Got it!

Team B... attention. The kitten's coming

You go back. There's accident

Tak, the kitten gets in the subway

Keep an eye on the kitten. I'm coming

Report location...

Where're you?

Where?

Tak, can you hear me?

Team C, the kitten
is going to your point

Got it

Tak... he's run away

Report location

We're inside the bus

Friend of Fitness?

Where are you?

We're going to Chatham Road

I'm Tak Wong
I'm not available at the moment...

I'm going to Friend of Fitness, Tak
Join me, quick

No...

Help...

Stop!

Stop. Police!

Help... Stop!

Stop!

Police! Stop!

Help...

What's up? Cherrie's inside

Don't worry, hold... hold on

Is that Ken?

Ran at the back door
You look after her

It's okay

Okay

You'd better get home

I'll work so long tonight

Let me send her home. She lives near us
Sure

Call me if anything happens

You gotta sleep early tonight

I don't know if I can sleep

Come in if you're free

Sure. I'm still staying up
Let's have a chat

How are you going?

It's heard that Ken ran again

Yes... we're searching for him

My paparazzi friends
in Hong Kong sent me a tape

It's about Fei Tong

I don't know if it's useful

I've sent them to police

Look

Tak, it's for you

Look

Serve yourself, I change clothes

Okay

Read these rare books

The Fitness Consultant Cherrie

and I were in the same college
but 2 forms lower

Such a coincidence

But at that time...

No wonder she's a fitness consultant now

Mess things up? What a savage

Are you human being?

Ken loves you so much
but you don't go with him?

Remember the ballet team in college?

You're so fat

You're more than 70 pounds?

Totally different from other classmates

You can't participate in the X'mas Ball

Come if you keep under 70 pounds

Remember the attitude
of the manager last time?

Do you remember?

Do you remember!

We'll call you later

So fat, still want to be an OL

You'll never able to give birth, hurray

You're happy, you're happy now?

I've checked your body

You've taken too many pills for slimming

which affect your kidney and liver

You'll never be able to have baby

Now is my turn

You must revenge

70 pounds...

They spend so much...

to lose weight. What do they do for?

Flattering the guys

I'm working on it with Cherrie

It doesn't work. It's not fair

Everyone should have 70 pounds to be fair

Why don't you be one of them?

You're the one inside Cherrie?

I'm much cleverer

I just give Ken something

then he helps me to deal with those women

Help me!

I did them...

I did them all!

Cherrie, wake up

You can't let it control you. Wake up

Don't stop. You're right

Go ahead!

No phone number displayed

Miss!

What's up?

Help... It's me!

I can't control myself...

I did them all!

I'm Tak Wong
I'm not available at the moment

Please leave a message

Inspector Wong
we got Ken's body in Friend of Fitness

The forensic is coming

You're sick
See the doctor and you'll be okay

Shoot me

Shoot me!

Why don't you shoot me?

Coz you have no bullets

Why do you know?

It isn't your turn now!

I forget it, sorry

Honey... you scared me

Are you okay?

Do you get hurt?

Okay

Let's go

Why don't your hands shiver?

No. They've been shivering

Let's go. Call back-up, quick

She's nervous breakdown
She has dual personality

That's not the original Cherrie

Gotta save her

Don't worry. I didn't kill her

Call an ambulance

Thank you

Tea time!

What? You're free

Need to do nothing?

Sure Sure?

Go find some

Go home and do it
