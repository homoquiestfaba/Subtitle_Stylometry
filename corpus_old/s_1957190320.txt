<i>Hallmark Hall of Fame
A Dog Named Christmas
Closed Captioned</i>

MAN: <i>
It was late summer,
I was told,</i>

<i>and even though he had been content with the Connor family,</i>

<i>his departure
was predictable.</i>

<i>They'd found him resting on
their front porch one winter.</i>

<i>They fed him, cleaned him
and vaccinated him.</i>

<i>But the Connors knew
that a walk on</i>

<i>could just as easily walk off.</i>


<i>He journeyed west
away from the city,</i>

<i>along the river
and across the fields.</i>

<i>He must have roamed
for quite some time,</i>

<i>following a path that surely
led him past many dangers.</i>

[truck horn blaring]

BOY: Hand me that rock.

BOY 2: Hit the dog.



[laughing
and chattering]

[coyote howling]

<i>He couldn't have known
how long it would take</i>

<i>or how far he would travel.</i>

<i>But he was being pulled
in a very particular direction</i>

<i>to a very particular place.</i>

<i>He'd come a long way,</i>

<i>but his journey wasn't over.</i>


Wow!

Yeah.

[humming tune]

[animal chattering]

Hey.

Hey, Mr. Gopher.

What happened to your leg?

Oh, you're hurt.

Don't worry.

I'm gonna take you
home and I'm gonna


Don't be scared.

It's okay. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I gotta...
but you're sick.

I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

You can stay in my room.

We're gonna give you
some food

and Dad is going to
help me give you a bed

and we'll call
a professor...



MAN:

Todd.

Hi, Dad.

That's a good color.
What do you call it?

Mr. Erdman's potting shed.

Mr. Erdman gave it to me.

Dad, I could paint all
the way to the top

if I could use the ladder.

No, no. No ladders, Todd.

No ladders.

Okay, Dad.

You remember why?

Because I always climb too high

and I don't want to fall
and break my collarbone again.

That's right.

[pats back]

I need you to help me
fix the front gate.

All right.

I'll clean
this up later.

Clean the brush
first, son.

Hey, Dad.

Old Stubbs looks thin.

We should deworm
her, right, Dad?

Yeah, I think you're right.

We need to go into town
and get some tomorrow.

Okay.

I'm all done with my chores.

Can I take care
of my hawk now?

Yes. Go ahead, sure.

Hi. Yeah, can I get 40 bales?

Square bales on Friday?

-TODD: Hi, Jay.
-That'd be great.
Thank you.

Are you feeling
better today?

I brought you some food.

'Cause Professor Stroud says
you have to eat it

and then you'll get all better.

Think you can
fly over here?

Come here, Jay.

Come here.

Good!

Your wing's so much better.

See you later, Jay.

This is Kim.

Ms. Dowell, this is Todd McCray
in Crossing Trails.

Yes, Todd.

Don't I keep asking you
to call me Kim?

What's up?

Have you found
another injured bird?

No, I still have Jay.

Is Professor David Stroud in?

Just caught him.[car horn honks]

Professor?

This is David.

Hi, Professor.

It's Todd McCray
in Crossing Trails.

Yes, I heard.

Hi, Todd.
How's the hawk?

Did you follow my instructions?

Yes. I think
that his humerus is better

because he's flapping
and flying around the cage.

That's good.
Really good work, Todd.

And he eats all the time.

Sounds like you've
taken good care of him.

I have.

Well, then you remember
what we talked about--

what comes next, Todd?

See you bought out
the store again.

MARY ANN:
Not quite.

Don't worry, I'll send you back
tomorrow for the rest.

He's so much better than he
was when I first saw him.

Well, if that's the case,

I think it's time for you
to release him into the wild.

All right,
I will.

Thank you.

Hi, Mom.

Hi, Todd.

Who were you talking to?

Professor Stroud.

Says it's time
to let Jay go.

If I keep him
too long,

he won't have
a good life.

That's what
Professor Stroud says.

Well, he's right.

You wouldn't be doing the
bird any favors to keep it

when it can make it
on its own.

Why don't you help Todd
with that.

I'll get the rest of the
groceries and start supper.

All right.

Come on, son,
let's go.

[Jay screeches]
TODD:
It's okay, Jay.

Shh, shh, shh.

Let's put him up on
these barrels, Todd.


Shh. Shh.

All right.


Hey.

It's okay.

Don't be scared, okay?

Professor Stroud's right, Todd.

You have to let him go.

[bird chirps]

[cage rattles]

Hey, go see
your family again.

[bird screeches]

Bye, Jay.

Hey, hey, hey,
you did good.


You did good.

He can be
his own master again.

Because I set him free?

Mm-hmm, yeah,
that's right.

Okay.

I think Mom's probably
got dinner ready.

Let's go in,
all right?

Okay.
All right,
good boy.

["Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"
playing on radio]

Todd, when you're done clearing
the table,

I'd want you to go upstairs
and clean your room.

Okay.

No, Todd,
look at me.

I know you don't like
doing it,

but I want you to at least
put away your shoes and clothes.

I want that room clean
for the Christmas party.

I will.

MAN [on radio]:
If that song doesn't get you
in the Christmas spirit,

I've got just the thing
that will.

We have someone here in our very
own studio, Hayley Ronaldson,

manager of the Santee County
animal shelter.

Hayley Ronaldson?
Don't we know her?

Yeah, Hayley Price.
Hannah's friend, remember?

Oh, that's right, yeah.

HAYLEY:
What we've done
is we've created a program

that we call
Adopt-A-Dog for Christmas.

Now, our employees
and volunteers

naturally would like to take
a few days off at Christmas

to spend time
with their loved ones.

The problem is, is this leaves
us shorthanded at the shelter.

So what we're doing
is offering people a chance

to care for a dog
for the holidays.

No, Todd.

Come on by the shelter
and pick out a dog to take home.

Oh, Dad...
No.

Give him or her lots of love
and affection over the holidays,

and then you bring the dog back
after Christmas on the 26th.

That is, of course,
unless you decide to keep it.

Dad, could we get
a dog?
No, Todd!

MAN:
That sounds like
a doggone good idea.

And good luck with the program.

It sounds like a real winner.

It's a real
winner, Dad.
You know...

It's a real winner!

This is a farm, Todd.

We raise animals for a purpose.

That purpose
is to make a living.

Mom has horses.

Well, yeah,
which are for breeding.

She sells the colts each year.

Dad, the shelter wants us
to have a dog for the holidays.

It's just
for a few days

so that the dogs
aren't alone

in their kennels
for Christmas.

You know, it's just...
it's not that simple.

They figure that when
folks get the dog home,

they're gonna bond with it

and somebody is gonna
beg to keep it--

that would be you--
and then somebody else

is gonna give in.

Besides, we don't need any more
animals around here.

[dishes clattering]

Most definitely not a dog.

It's a real winner.

[piano playing gentle melody]

[music stops]

Making a list
and checking it twice?

It's year-end bills.

So...

about that
Adopt-A-Dog thing.

We've talked about
dogs before.

No, we've never talked
about dogs before.

You've always
just said no.

Why can't we bend
on this a little?

We never bent with any
of the other kids.

I don't want to make
an exception with Todd.

But they didn't need it
the way Todd does.

And in this case,
it wouldn't be permanent.

Exactly. We're going to upset
his daily routine for what,

for a week?

He's gonna fall in love
with that dog

after three wags of a tail,

and then we're going
to force him to take it back.

Do you have any idea how hard
that's gonna be on him?

He's raised 4-H calves
and sheep

and sold them
when it came time.

That's... different.

Livestock don't...
get into a boy's heart

the way a dog does.

He's not a boy.

And if you don't want him
to be a burden,

he needs these kinds

of opportunities.

My answer is still no.

MAN: <i>
Got a man in back!</i>

You can put McCray
on the chopper.

Hey, good news, McCray.
You're going home.

Where's my dog?

Take it easy.
Take it easy.

You're not gonna be walking
any time soon, okay?

My-my dog.

There wasn't
any dog, okay?

Get him on the
chopper, guys.

I gotta find him.

[helicopter engine whirring]

<i>I gotta find my dog!</i>


[groans softly]

[boy laughing]



Ooh-ee!

You a lucky man.
Yes, sir.

What about you?

You got yourself
a girl?

Boy, I get lots of girls,

<i>but not one that writes me
every day.</i>

[cow mooing]

[rooster crowing]

[knocking on door]
Breakfast.

Oh, Todd.

Mom, can you talk to Dad about
the Adopt-A-Dog program?

Because I've been thinking
about it a lot, a really lot,

and it's a good thing
to help out...

and I'm a responsible person.

I know.

You're a young man now, right?

I <i>am</i> a young man now.

MARY ANN:
I thought this year
we might get a live tree.

One that we could plant
somewhere on the place

after Christmas.
What do you think?

Yeah. Yeah,
I could pick one up.

I have to go into town
after work

to pick up dewormer anyway.

You need anything
from Hank's?

What do I need to do?

Well, you can help me
pick out the tree.

You're a real good
tree picker.

No, what do I need
to do to get the dog?

The radio says it's
a really good idea.

I'm sure they do, Todd.
We've been through this already.

But you always say

that anything worth having
is worth working for.

And a dog is worth having.

I want to work
for a dog.

Son, you don't understand.

But I do.
I do understand.

I'm a young man now.

And I want to work for it.
What do I need to do?

Look, I'll tell you right now

I don't think this
is a good idea.

But if I were to agree,

we would have to
do things my way.

When the dog got here,

I would expect you
to take care of it--

not your mother
and not me.

And I would expect you

to keep up with
all of your chores.

I will. I promise.

You have to give your
word that when it's time

to take the dog back to
the shelter, you'll do it.

Without complaining.

I give you my word.

What about your room?

I know you
think it's clean,

you know where
everything is,

it all makes
sense to you,

but to your mother and me,
it's a jungle in there.

I'll clean my room.

No, I mean really
clean, Todd.

I don't mean stuffing
things in the closet

and putting stuff
under the bed.

I'll get it really clean.

That's right,
I mean really clean.

Deal.

Well, all right,
then, yeah, okay.

Then we have a deal.

Well, let's go feed.

I have to go help Dad.

We're gonna feed
the cows.

I don't know why
you feel the need

to make this so hard for him.

TODD:
You need to eat
all your food.

Good girl.

You'll grow up
big and strong.

[cows mooing]

All right,
that's enough, Katie.

Want some, too, Lucy?

All right, come here.
Come here, Lucy.

Good girl. Good girl.


All right, we'll do this
on three, all right?

Okay.

One, two, two and a half...

Dad!

You said three!

I said--
well, did I?

You didn't say
two and a half.

["Good King Wenceslas"
playing quietly over speakers]

Hi, Mr. Fisher.

I'm getting a dog
for Christmas.

No kidding?

No kidding.

I'm paying for this
with my allowance.

Well, not just yet.

You've got a couple things
to do first.

I have to clean my room
before I can get it.

I have to get it
really clean.

I'll hang on to these
for you, Todd.

Bye, Mr. Fisher.

Merry Christmas.

-Hey, Todd.
-Merry Christmas, Todd.

I'm getting a dog!

Oh, that's great.

We'll see you later.

-Bye, Todd.
-He's excited.

Just like you when
you were a kid.

Never saw you without
that dog of yours.

What was his name?

Uh, Tucker.

-That's right.
-Yeah, that's right.

All right, Hank, take care.

Oh, Todd.
Hang on a minute.

I almost forgot.

I got something for you.

I kept meaning to bring
this paint over to you,

but I just kept
forgetting.

Thanks, Mr. Fisher.

All right, we'll see you
at our Christmas party

-on the 16th?
-You got it.

Oh, do me a favor,
will you, George?

Put Jean's ornament at the top
of the tree this year

so I don't have to hear her
moaning about it like last year.

I'll see what I can do.

["We Wish You A Merry Christmas"
playing]

Oh, look, Hannah's
baby ballet shoes.

Life goes by so fast.

Just some days
seem awfully long.

Here, Todd,
take this to your mother.

Who gave us this one?

Jonathan made
that for you.

For your first Christmas.

He must have
been what, ten.

Why don't you put
it right there.

Todd, I believe

this is the prettiest
tree we've ever had.

Thank you so much
for finding it.

May I go clean my room?

You certainly may.

Never thought you'd hear that,
did you, Mr. McCray?


Thank you.

[bottles rattling, thudding]

[bottles rattling]

Give... Just give me a bunch.

George.

Guess I'll get Todd to help me
deworm that cow tomorrow.

Okay, now go.

Go? Okay.

No, Dad,
it's not over there.

Are you sure?
Okay.
You stop it.

It's over here.

Now don't look
-till I say.
-Okay.

Can I...
how about just one eye?

No, not till I say.

One, two, three...

Look!

Wow.
Incredible.

GEORGE:
Todd, wow.

TODD:
I got it really clean.

Can I go pick out
my dog now?

Well, what time is it?

8:36.

Well, I think
we'll have to wait

till the shelter's open
in the morning.

In the morning for sure?

Yeah. In the morning
for sure.

[rooster crowing]

Hey, Dad.

You ready to go get
the dog now?

I'm feeling kind
of sick today.

I got a big old
headache.

Might have to spend
the day in bed.

You said we could go pick out
the Christmas dog this morning.

George,
stop torturing him.

I could be getting pneumonia.

Well, Todd, since your dad
is feeling so ill,

I guess I'll have
to go with you

to get the dog.

And...
I think you should drive.

You mean off the farm?

Can I use second gear?

I'm feeling much better.

Pneumonia's gone.

Very funny, Dad.


TODD: <i>
How much longer, Dad?</i>

About five days.

We've got to cross
the Rocky Mountains.

We have to go through
the Mojave Desert...

No, how much
longer, really?

Ten minutes.

Big day, huh?

It is a big day.

It's a really big day.

And when do we
take the dog back?

On December 26.

That's when
Christmas ends.

That's when he has to
go back to the shelter.

That's when he has
to go back to the shelter.

Okay.

Okay.
Okay.

I got these.

Okay.

[dogs barking]

Hey. Help you
with something?

Yeah, we're
looking for Hayley.

Hayley. Someone to see you.

Mr. McCray. Hey.
Hi.

How's Hannah?

Oh, she's great.

I'll tell her
you asked.

Uh, Todd is here
to pick up his Christmas dog.

Hey, Todd.

I remember the year you
won all those ribbons

at the county fair.

Yes, I was in 4-H.

Yeah, and I
remember how nicely
you treated the animals.

Where are all the dogs?

Come on, they're
in the back.

I'll show you.

It's all right.

HAYLEY:
So you can look
over all the dogs,

and then we'll decide
if there's a good fit

for you and your
family, okay?

-I like your shelter.
-Thank you.

How many other people
have called in?

Well, you're
still the first,

but hopefully...

Wow, that's a lot of dogs.

Yeah, we normally have
around 25 in here at once,

but now
we've got 33.

TODD:
Why are there so many?

Where do they
all come from?

Dogs come to us for a
lot of different reasons.

Um, they get lost.

Their owners drop
them off

because they can't
afford to keep them.

And sometimes, when people
don't want their dogs anymore,

they just dump 'em,
and we pick 'em up.

What's this one's name?

That's Pork Chop.
Pork Chop?

Hi, Pork Chop.
She's a basset
hound-beagle mix.

Did she get lost?

Well, she had her collar
and her tags.

We were able
to contact the owner,

but he never showed up.

Why didn't he come
pick up his dog?

She was waiting for him.

How people treat a dog
says a lot about them.

Sometimes, people have
to spend so much time

taking care of themselves

that they don't have
anything left for an animal.

Whoa!
Do you want
to see this one?

Yeah.

This is Sally.

Hi, Sally.

She's a Border collie.

Oh, she's a pretty
Border collie.

Mm-hmm.
Hi.

Were you sleeping?

She got hurt, huh?

You're right.
How can you tell?

She has a scar.

Hello.

This is Serena.

Hi, Serena.

You're so small.

[dog barks]

Who's that?

That's Buddy.

He's really gentle.

He's actually been here
for a little while.

Hey, there. Hi.

HAYLEY:
She's very gentle.

You just go on in.
You can pet her.

She's a doll.

I can't see her face.

-Hi, Winky!
-And that's a sheepdog.

That's Shelby.

Whoa, so much hair.

Hi. Yeah.

Look at you.
You're so pretty.

Lassie?
I watched a movie with you.

She's a little shy,
but no, she likes you!


What is she?
What is she?

She's an Australian
shepherd.

He's big.

This is Sarge.
Hey, Sarge.

[both chuckling]

[dog whimpers]

What's his name?

He doesn't
have one yet.

We just brought
him in yesterday.

Hasn't been here
long enough for us
to give him a name.

Do you want
to look him over?

Now, I checked him out

this morning.

He's had some training.
Watch this. Good boy. Good boy.

Now stay.

Sit.

Good. Stay.

Lie down. Lie down.

Good.

Hi.

TODD:
Why is he so dirty?

HAYLEY:
I haven't had time
to clean him yet.

He's been on his own
for awhile.

He hasn't had anybody
to take care of him.

Hi!

This one.

I want this one.

-This is your collar.
-Nice.

Merry Christmas.

TODD:
Go on! Yeah!

Come on! Come on, boy!

No, this is our truck
right here.

Come here. Come here.

Let's go!
Come here, boy!

Come here!
Come here!

Such a good boy.

Okay, up!

He's a good dog, huh, Dad?

Yeah, seems like...

seems like a real good dog.


When do we take him back?

We take him back
on December 26

because that's when
Christmas ends.

Good.

His name is Christmas, Dad.

Well, that's a...

that's a good
name for a dog.

That's a... that's
a real good name.

Look, Dad,
he likes you!


There you go.

Good boy.
Come here.

Come here, Christmas.
Come here. Come here.

Hang on to him.
He's your dog.


TODD:
Come here, Christmas!
Come here!

What took you so long?

I was beginning
to worry about you.

GEORGE:
Dog picking is hard work.
Takes time.

Mom, look,
his name is Christmas.

Oh, well...

[clicks tongue]


Todd, what a
perfect name.

Watch this.

Christmas? Sit.

Christmas, lie down.

Oh, George, do you see how well
that dog minds?

Todd is definitely

a good dog picker.

Yeah, he sure is.

Mom, there were 33 dogs
at the shelter.

That many?
Yeah.

And the first one
was named Pork Chop.

And the next one
was named Sally.

She was a Border collie.

[Christmas barks outside]

TODD:
You can't catch me!
Can't catch me, Christmas!

Drop the ball!
Drop the ball!

Come here, Christmas!

I have to have the ball
so we can play fetch.

Come here! Come...!

Christmas![barking]

Okay, okay, when I throw it,
then you go get it, right?

One, two, three, fetch!

Fetch the ball, Christmas!

Good boy!

That's fetch![barking]

Drop the ball!

Drop the ball,
Christmas!

Ready? One,
two, three, go!

[boy laughing]

Come on. Tucker?

Tucker? Tucker?[barking]



TODD:
Good boy.

Christmas,
give me the ball!

NEWSWOMAN:
Violence here
is making it much harder

for the military
to carry out its mission.

Both soldiers and civilians

are frequently caught
in the cross fire,

and the volatile situation is
limiting what soldiers can do.

That puts our forces
in a very difficult position.

In the last two months,

Pentagon officials have been
pressing for more troops,

but the pressure from both
congress and the president,

mounting public...

Good night, Mom.

Good night, Todd.

Good night, Dad.

Night, son.

Come on, Christmas.
Let's go to bed.

I'll show you my room.

Fast friends already.

Good night, darling.

Good night.
I'll be up in a minute.

-Take cover.
-Come on. Stay in line.

Go, go!

Clear!

[men talking in hushed voices]

We're clear!

-We got a Charlie.

Out!

Come out!

What you got there, McCray?!

you still got any
of that beef jerky

What are you
grinning at?

Come here, boy.
Here, boy! Come here!

Charlie! [laughs] Come here!

Come here.
Come here, boy.

Come here! Come here!


[groans softly]

George?

It's just a bit of a dream.

Go back to sleep.

You all right?

Yeah. No, it's... nothing.

You haven't had one
of those in a while.

No, it's-it's nothing.

Really.

Go back to sleep.

Can we go
around the corral again?

Yeah, and make her
gallop, Uncle Todd.

We're not allowed
to gallop.

Whoa.

[Christmas barking]

TODD:
Jonathan's here!

Hi!
Hi!

Hi, Ryan!

Look at us!

[children shouting greetings]

Hey!


How is it you get so much
bigger after only one month?

We just
keep on eating.

Like, every day.

Every day?
That must be it.

Hi, Uncle Todd.

Merry Christmas.

Can we have a ride?

Maybe later.

Hey, Alex, you should see
the presents under the tree.

There's, like,
a ton of them.

You know we
can't open them.

-It's not Christmas.
-Yeah, we know.

We expected you-- I don't know--
a half an hour ago.

I bet.

Every Christmas, you
look a year older.

Why is that?

That's funny, son. Same thing
seems to happen to you,

but Faye looks younger.

-Is this cake all for me?
-Yes, absolutely,

because you're my
favorite in-law.

Oh.

Oh, Mom, that ham looks amazing.

I know. It turned out
beautifully, didn't it?

-Hi, Nana!
-Merry Christmas!

Hello!
Merry Christmas, Nana!

Merry Christmas
to you, too!

To both of you.
Look at you.

So handsome.

I've got those pictures
I took at your soccer match.

Remind me later.

Okay. Can we go look
under the tree now?

Yes, please!
I need a break already.

Merry Christmas.

Thomas, what's that?

What?
Oh.

You can start
the celebration now.

Hannah's home!

And this aunt really
needs a hug from...

anyone who's under
four feet tall!

Aunt Hannah!

You missed our
soccer game. We won.

Nice work.

[chattering indistinctly]

This is amazing.

Thank you.

Can we all do this again
on Christmas day?

In-laws get Christmas day.

My mother always
wants me to tell you

how much she
appreciates that.

Mine, too.
Thank you.

Well, when Hannah
gets some in-laws,

she's going to
change the rules

and everybody's
going to come here.

Well, anything to get you
from eating your own cooking,

huh, Hannah?

I'm a good cook.

Aren't I, Todd?

You're the best.
After Mom, though.

Thank you, Todd.

So, Dad you finally let
yourself get suckered

into having a dog
on the place.

Yeah, what happened?

You going soft on us?

Okay, that's enough, boys.

I just wish this
softie was around

when we were younger.

No. It's just for a few days.

He'll be going back to the
shelter the day after Christmas.

Right, Todd?

Right, Dad.
On December 26th.

He's going back
to the shelter?

FAYE:
What, you're
not keeping him?

You know what will happen
to him, don't you, Dad?

TODD:
Mom, may I please
have some more ham?

Yes, you may.

REBECCA:
Why? What's going
to happen, Mom?

LUCILLE:
Nothing, sweetie.
We'll talk about it later.

TODD:
Come on, Christmas.

Eat up, buddy. This could
be one of your last meals.

Jonathan!

Jonathan, you're not supposed
to feed him people food.

You're right. You're right.

We never had a dog,
so I don't know the rules.

Hey, did you know
Christmas can do tricks?

TWINS:
Cool! Can we see?

TODD:
Okay. Watch this.

Christmas, sit!


Christmas...

lie down.

Christmas, roll over.

Roll over.

Oh!


Can I try?

Sure. But let me show
you one more first,

because I taught
him this one, okay?

Christmas...

sing!

â™ª Jingle Bells,
Jingle Bells â™ª

â™ª Jingle all the way [barking]

â™ª Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh â™ª

Is that not the sweetest thing?

[others joining in]:
â™ª Hey

â™ª Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way â™ª

â™ª Oh, what fun it is to ride

â™ª In a one horse open sleigh [barking]

â™ª <i>Hey!</i>â™ª

No, I have it.
Thanks.

Okay.

[singing "Deck the Halls"
in other room]

Could you give me a hand, Todd?

â™ª Fa, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la â™ª

Thanks, buddy.

â™ª See the blazing Yule
before us â™ª

Hi, James!

Hi, Todd!

â™ª Fa, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la â™ª

Ooh. Be careful
with that, Todd.

â™ª Strike the harp
and join the chorus â™ª

â™ª Fa, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la â™ª

â™ª Follow me
in merry measure... â™ª

Anybody home?

Merry Christmas,
-Hank!
-Hank! Jean!

Merry Christmas, Hank!

-So glad you're here.
-Me, too.

-Hank, Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Jean, Merry Christmas.

Oh, what a
beautiful ornament.

I have the perfect place
for it on the tree.

Now I know the Christmas season
is officially upon us.

Hi, Mrs. Fisher.

You want to see my dog,
Christmas?

You got a dog for Christmas?

No, his name is Christmas.
He's over here.

This is Christmas.

Christmas,

shake!


You got him
trained already.

Would've taken me months
to get a dog trained that well.

Todd didn't have
months, Hank.

And Dad says Christmas
has to go back

to the animal shelter
on the 26th.

What's the matter, George?
You don't like Christmas?

He's only here on loan.

Is there something
wrong with him?

The shelter wants people to take
dogs over the holidays,

so we're just trying
to do our part.

Hey, you could do it,
too, Mr. Fisher.

GEORGE:
Yeah.

Why don't you try that, Hank?

Yeah, well, I'm getting a little
too old to be adopting a dog.

No, you're not too
old, Mr. Fisher.

I think
it's a wonderful idea.

Hank, why don't we?

Well, only if I can find
a dog I can warm up to.

And what kind of dog
would that be, Hank,

a bulldog?

THOMAS:
More like a pit bull.


Jonathan and Thomas,

you guys should do it, too.

Yeah, I can tell you guys think
it's a good idea, don't you?

[both groan]

HANK:
You know, George...

they've really inspired me.

You guys are going to lead
by example, aren't you?

Taking in those cuddly
homeless dogs

for your kids to love.

Now, that's noble.

Actually, I
didn't plan on...

Well, Faye and I are going to go
see the folks, so we're, uh...

You know, it's so
generous of you

to take time out of
your hectic schedule

to go down to the shelter,
both of you,

and pick out a dog.

TWINS:
We're getting a dog, Daddy?

Oh, hey,

guys, no way.

I think that it's
a fabulous idea, boys.

I can make a list, okay?

Mom, I need a
pen and paper.

Well, I'll get them for you.

Okay. Hey,
you guys want

to help me sign
people up, too?

Yeah, sure.
Okay.

Okay. Dad, we're going

to make an Adopt-A-Dog
list, okay?

All right.
Perfect, perfect.

You know, George,

I think your sons have
really started something.

I'm real proud of my boys.


TODD:
Jonathan gets one.

Mr. Fisher gets one.

Lucy and Thomas...

You know, Dad,

donations to a nonprofit
are fully deductible.

Considering all the dogs
you placed tonight,

you could probably write off
the whole party.

Really?
No, Dad.

I can't believe
this, Todd.

How many people
signed up?

Seven.

We're going to take this over
to Hayley in the morning.

And then
I can get some more.

No, Todd. One dog.

That's all.

No. More people, Dad.

'Cause Hayley says
she needs more people

so that all the dogs
have homes for Christmas.

Just until the 26th.

That's when the dogs
go back to the shelter.

Right?

Not all the dogs.

Right.

Some people will
keep their dogs.

We are not keeping
the dog.

I'll see you Christmas day.

Play your cards right, I might
let you drive the tractor.

You used to love that
when you were a kid.

Yeah, the tractor
was always great, Dad,

but I really loved
being with you.

Jonathan gets one...

Same here.
Still do.

You, don't stay up too late.

You've got chores
in the morning.

Night, Dad.

Don't use the help too hard.

We might need them
when we're old.

I'll be up in a few minutes.

Night, Dad.

Night, honey.

Ow.

Ow.



[mattress creaks]


That was quick.

Get down.

Get off.

Get.

Just...

Get lost!

Get off.


[birds chirping]

[train whistle blowing
in distance]

Good morning, Hayley.

Hey, Todd.

Is everything okay
with your dog?

Yes, Christmas
is wonderful.

Todd's actually got something
he'd like to give you.

It's a lot of people
from our Christmas party--

not the kids, though,
just the grown-ups--

they all want to take a dog.

Are you serious?

Yeah.

And they didn't know about it,
but now they do.

And then they all said yes.

With a little
convincing.

Wow, this is amazing.

Todd, I don't know
how to thank you.

No one else has even called.

Yeah.

How many more people
do you need now?

Well, if everybody
on this list takes a dog,

we'll need about... 25 more.

Okay, I'll find some more.

[door opens]

[Christmas barking]



[bell in ball jingles]
Go on.


[cow mooing]




TODD:
But that's okay, Mrs. Erdman.

You don't have to want
a forever dog.

You just have to take
a Christmas dog.

All you do is go see Hayley,
down at the shelter.

Well, you should
definitely hurry up

'cause dogs are going fast

and there aren't
a lot more days.

[woman talking indistinctly
on phone]

Okay. Bye.

She said okay!

You're a hard man to turn down.


You want out?



[wrench ratcheting]

[tool clatters, George grunts]

What is with you?

Don't you have
anything better to do?


Shoo!

But it's only
until December 26th.

That's when Christmas ends.

[woman talking indistinctly
on phone]

Okay. Good-bye, Mrs. Burke.

She said no.

Still at it?

Todd's placed
five more dogs already.

I'm telling you, George,
he is some operator.

You want to help, Dad?

How many are left?

There are...

...20 more.

We may run out of friends.

Probably already
run out of friends.

Dad, we need to work harder.

There's only
a few more days.

Well, how many dogs
have you placed already?

Twelve?
That's amazing.

You should be proud
of that right there.

No, it's not good enough.

Well, I'm just saying
there's no shame

in not finding a home
for every dog.

-It's not good enough, Dad.
-Well...

George, instead
of discouraging your son,

why don't you help him?

I'm not discouraging him.

You've called everybody we know.

It's been on the radio.

What else are you
supposed to do?

MARY ANN:
What about your
Rotary buddies?

GEORGE:
Well, why don't you look
at your school roster?

Call Betty Meyer.

Give her that little...
give her the little poodle.

That little...
what was his name?

Hannah took the poodle.

-Her name is Serena.
-Hannah?

She's not supposed to...

She's not supposed to have
pets in her apartment.

I think she bribed
the manager.

Yeah, well, she's turned into
a regular little outlaw.

Should have
raised her better.

And what's-what's...

Where's Todd? Isn't this
supposed to be his thing?

Someone must be lost.

No, they're not.

What is going on?

Todd seems to know.

Hi, I'm Brianna Lewis
from Channel 8.

Hi, Brianna Lewis.

My name is Todd McCray
from Crossing Trails.

Nice to meet you, Todd.

This is Christmas.

You want to shake hands
with him, too?

Uh... absolutely!

Hi, there, Christmas.

I've heard so
much about you.

Oh, hi.

You must be
Todd's parents.

-We are. I'm George McCray.
-Nice to meet you.

-This is my wife, Mary Ann.
-Hi.
Hi.

Your son called
the station

and he was quite persuasive.

I did a little research,
and the station manager agreed

that we should do a story
about the Adopt-A-Dog
for Christmas program.

Can we come in and talk
to you all about it?

Yes. It's this way.

Come here, boy.

TODD:
Come here.

CAMERAMAN:
Rolling.
Christmas--

the happiest day
of the year, right?

At least that's what
we want it to be.

Every year, we rush around,

trying to ensure that everything
is perfect for the big day--

making lists, getting presents.

But what does Christmas
really mean?

Tonight, we're going to talk
to a very special young man

who found his own answer
to that question.

GEORGE:
Oh, there he is. There he is.

[Mary Ann cheers]

BRIANNA:
When 20-year-old Todd McCray

found out about
a program being offered

by the Santee County
animal shelter,

the Adopt-A-Dog
for Christmas program,

he knew it was something
he wanted to be involved in.

Todd, would you tell us
about the Adopt-A -Dog program?

It's not really adopting.

You can adopt if you want
to, but you don't have to.

You can just take a dog
home for Christmas.

And why is it so important

for people to adopt a dog
for Christmas?

Why wouldn't you?

The dogs don't have
moms or dads.

And... everybody needs
somebody to love them.

[Christmas groans]

Especially at Christmas.

It's like...
it's like the best gift.

Lucky dogs.

Lucky people.

So, let's all do what we can

to make Todd's dream come true.

The shelter will be staying
open late the next few nights

and until noon on the 21st.

Adopt-A-Dog for Christmas.

This is Brianna Lewis,
for Channel 8 News.

Wow, that was...



You did real good, son.

-Real good.
-It was wonderful!

You were fabulous!

So was Christmas!

I'm just gonna go
stretch my legs.

HANNAH:
You're a TV star now.


I'm so proud of you.


Post us out there
at 1400 hours.

All right.
Got it.

GEORGE: <i>
"Dear Mary Ann,</i>

<i>"I just received
your most recent letter</i>

<i>"and I can't tell you
how much it lifted my spirits.</i>

<i>"In answer to your question,</i>

<i>"yes, Good Charlie
is still with me</i>

<i>"and in fact, he's become our company mascot.</i>

<i>"Wherever I go,
this dog is right by my side.</i>

<i>"In the middle
of all this craziness,</i>

<i>"it's Charlie and your letters
that have really kept me sane.</i>

<i>"I love and miss you
with all my heart.</i>

<i>George."</i>

[door opening]

I think he likes
that dog, George.

Well, you're
right about that.

How about you?

Do you like the dog?

Well, ye...

Yeah, if you like furry types,
I guess he's all right.

It's complicated.

Mm-hmm.

Have I ever told you how much
your letters meant to me?

You told me a thousand times.

I should have told you
a million times.

It's cold.

Come on.


[horn honking]

Hey![Christmas barking]

Todd did it!

He did it!
Did what?

The phone's been ringing
off the hook

the past couple days
and it hasn't stopped.

Seems like everybody that was
watching TV the other night

decided that they could
suddenly foster a dog.

He cleared out
the shelter!

That's wonderful,
Hayley.

Todd, look what you did.

GEORGE:
Good for you.[whimpers]

Is that your dog?

No, I was just locking up
when she was brought in.

My mom's in a nursing
home over in Wichita

so looks like I'll have
some company for the road.

Oh, yeah, keep you
from being bored.

Yeah, you've got that right

because she's about
to have puppies.

Maybe we should...

No, Mary... No...
Mary Ann.

I'm really good
at birthing animals!

You guys have done
enough already.

It's too much.

She can't have puppies
in a car.

HAYLEY:
It's too much.

Okay, yeah.

Yeah, you can
take her.

Come here.

[dog whines]

There you go.


[low whine]

George, will you get my horses?

Sure.
Come on inside, Hayley.

Oh, thanks, Mary Ann,
I can't, but, um...

-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas.

TODD:
Good boy, come here.

[Christmas barks]
Great.

Is there anything
I can do?

Not that I can think of.

Okay, little one.

Come on, Ruthie.
That's a good girl.

You want to get in your box?

Ruthie? Is that what Hayley
wanted us to call her?

Who on earth would
name a dog Ruthie?

I would.


I'll be
out in the barn.

Oh, no. Ruthie!
Ruthie!

[Ruthie barking]

Ruthie, come back!

Ruthie! Oh, George!


Ruthie!

Ruthie, come here!

Why did you
let her out?!
I didn't.

She let herself out.

Ruthie!

TODD:

Ruthie!

Ruthie?

Here, Ruthie.
Here, girl.

Where are you,
sweetheart?
Where are you?

She's here!

Oh, come on, Ruthie.

Come back inside with us.


Mom, I think she wants to be
alone to have her babies.

She'll freeze out here.

No, Todd's right.

I'll get her food.

Make up a bed.

I'll figure out
some heat.
Okay.

It's okay.

We're gonna make you
a little bed.

You'll be okay here.


Come on. Come on.

Yeah, we're coming,
we're coming.
Okay.

TODD:
Whoa.


GEORGE:
You can open
one present now,

but save the rest
for after Hannah gets here.

Oh, here we go. Todd.

Ready?
Yeah.

-You got me new shoes!
-HANNAH:
Oh, sweet!


-It's a radio!
-You like it?

GEORGE:
Have just... Ow.
MARY ANN:
You okay?

Have that one.

Just rip it!

It's a tool chest
-for Dad.
-It matches my sweater.

Are there goodies?
Are there goodies?

TODD:
No, those aren't
good for you.

Stop eating the cookies!

[George laughing]

You can't do that.

It's a paintbrush!

-GEORGE: Oh!
-MARY ANN: Ooh!

See!
MARY ANN:
Very nice!

Come here, sweetie.


GEORGE:
-Oh, nice.
-It's so many colors!

It looks good
on Christmas.

Oh, it looks good.

-It's beautiful!
-TODD:
What is that?

What is it?

-With Hannah's help.
-You did not pick this.

-Well, Hannah helped me a little.
-Hannah picked this.

MARY ANN:
This is very sweet.

Mom wrapped it.

Oh, she did a
really good job.

Hmm...

Yeah, it's my favorite...

-I found it at the river.
-Oh!

It's my favorite one
that I saw there.

Oh, I love it.

Yeah.
Okay.

Oh, there you go.

Yeah.
Oh!
Snap.

You're so fast.
Uh-oh,
uh-oh.

Uh-oh.
Uh-oh...

[all laughing]


TODD:
What was your
favorite present?

Um, the stone. What else?

Bye, Mom.
Bye.

Thanks for all
the amazing food.

-Thanks, sweetie.
-Bye, Dad.

Drive safely, honey.

-I will.
-Bye, Hannah.

Bye, Todd.
-See you guys soon.
-You can go ahead now.

Bye.
Hey, away
from the table.

The pineapple.
Okay.

Get the pineapple
on a fork.

Remember how to
do this? You dip?

Oh.
Go ahead.

Hi, Ruthie.

Brought you some water.

Here.

You thirsty?

I got you a Christmas present.

Can you guess what it is?

It's a bone.

You like it?

Here you go.

You want one, too?

All right.

Come here, Christmas.

Come here.

Good boy!

Come here, Christmas.

Come here.

TODD:
Come here.

George?

Mm-hmm?

It was a perfect day.

It was.

What are you going to do
about Christmas tomorrow?

Christmas was today.

You know what I mean.

The easy thing would be
to let Todd keep him.

The easy thing is not
always the best thing.

Why not?

Why wouldn't it be
the best thing?

Because he has
to learn...

About loss?

Life will teach him
about loss, George.

We made the agreement.

Todd and I.

To go back on that agreement
is not going to help him

turn into a stronger,
more independent person.

If you and I are soft,

he'll expect the
world to be soft,

and he'll be in for
a rude awakening.

You know what I think?

I think you're afraid.

This is about what's
best for Todd.

If you say so.

What does that mean?

Nothing.

PENDLETON:
So, McCray, what's she like?

GEORGE:
Too good for you.

Hey, how you doing,
Charlie?

-Hey, boy.
-Hey, Charlie.
Good, boy.

-What's up, buddy.
-You a lucky man.

Hey, boy.

What about you?

You got yourself a girl?

Boy, I get lots of girls.[Charlie barking]

But not one that
writes me every day.

What's wrong, Charlie?

What is it?

[barking continues]


[loud explosion, George screams]

[frantic shouting]

Medic!

[pained groans]

Hey, McCray, good news.
Uh, you're going home.

GEORGE [hoarsely]:
Where's my dog?

I-I have to find him.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, take
it easy, take it easy.

Get him
on the chopper, guys.

-I've got to find him.
-It's gonna be
all right.

You're going home.

I gotta find my dog!

[Christmas barking]

[horse neighing]

[cow mooing]

What is it?
I don't know.

[barking continues]

[cow mooing, horse neighing]

-What's happening, Dad?
-I don't know.

-We don't know, honey.
-Christmas is barking.

I know.
-Why is he barking?
-No, no, wait, wait.

-Okay, okay.
-Why is he barking, Dad?


TODD:
Something's outside.

Dad?

[horses whinnying]

Why are you barking,
Christmas? Come here.

What is it, boy?

What's wrong?

George?

Dad, something's the
matter with Christmas.

-Don't let him out!
-What's out there?

What's out there?
Todd! No!
Don't go out there!

Christmas!
Todd!

-Christmas!
-Todd, I said stop!

Todd, wait!
Mary Ann, turn
on the light

-What is it?
-I don't know.

Just call the sheriff.

TODD:
Christmas! Christmas!

GEORGE:
Todd, don't go in there!

Christmas!

[horse neighing,
Christmas barking]

Todd!
Be careful!

[cougar snarling]

Come here, Christmas.

Todd, come back here!


-Get back here!
-Come here, Christmas.

Christmas!

GEORGE: Todd!

Todd!


[horse neighing]


Todd!
Come here.

[George screams]


TODD:
No, Christmas! Stop!

Christmas!

No!
Christmas!

Todd, no.

Are you okay?

George?

George, what
about Ruthie?

[horse whinnies]

Oh, boy.


Todd, you stay
right here.

Do you understand me?


Mary Ann, you and Todd
take Ruthie

and the puppies
up to the house.

What about
Christmas?

Well, let's just get
everybody up to the house,

and then...
I'll find him.

Todd, come here.

Look.

Ruthie had her puppies,
sweetie.

It's okay.
It's okay.

[door opens]

I'm going to look
for Christmas.

-I want to come.
-No. No. You just

take care of Ruthie and you
and your mom stay inside.

It's okay.

It's all right.

[engine starting]

[door opens]

The sheriff
called back,

and I told him there
was a big cat, Dad.

He said somebody else
saw a cougar, too.


Well, I'm going
to get a little rest,

and then I'll, uh,

I'll go back out
in a couple hours.


[dog barking]

He's home!

Christmas!

I knew that cougar wasn't
too big for Christmas.

Right, Dad?

[Christmas whining]

He did good.

TODD:
Yeah, you did so good.

You got cut.

I'll get you some iodine.


So, you want
to be petted, huh?

Well, I guess
you deserve it.

You're one amazing dog.


Come here, boy.

You're going
to be okay.

So, how's our new
mother doing?

MARY ANN:
She's fine.

They all look good.

[puppies whining]

Dad?

Mm-hmm?

It's the day after Christmas.

Yeah.

Yeah, it is.

We have to take Christmas
back to the shelter today.

Because that's how
the program works.

Take the dogs back

on December 26.

That's right.

That's how the program works.


And that was
our agreement.

â™ª Spend all your time waiting

Yeah.â™ª For that second chance

So good.â™ª For a break
that would make it okay â™ª

â™ª There's always some reason

â™ª To feel not good enough

â™ª And it's hard
at the end of the day â™ª

â™ª I need some distraction

â™ª Oh, beautiful release

â™ª Memories seep from my veins GEORGE:
You're a good boy.

â™ª They may be empty,
oh, and weightless â™ª[whining]

â™ª And maybe...

It's okay, Dad.

-I'll take him in.
-All right.

Christmas.

Come here.

â™ª In the arms Come here, boy.
Good boy.

â™ª of an Angel

Good boy.

â™ª Fly away from here

â™ª From this dark [whining]

â™ª Cold hotel room [barks]

â™ª And the endlessness
that you fear â™ª

Come on. Come here, boy.[barks]

â™ª You are pulled
from the wreckage â™ª

Hi!

â™ª Of your silent reverie

Bye, Christmas.[whining]

â™ª You're in the arms
of an Angel â™ª

[door closes]

â™ª May you find
some comfort here. â™ª

What's Todd up to?

He's painting.

Is this coffee fresh?

[phone ringing]

Yeah, yeah,
I'll get it.

Hello?

Mr. McCray? It's Hayley.

Uh, sorry I missed

you when you came by.

Oh, hi, Hayley.

How are you?

How's your mother?

She's doing well.

But that's not the reason
I'm calling.

I want to talk to you
about a position at the shelter.

We'd like to offer Todd a job.

Psst.

It doesn't pay much,[whispering]:
Come on. Wash 'em.

but he's so good
with the animals.

They really trust him.

Would you ask him
if that'd be okay?

The shelter is
offering Todd a job.

Uh, so...

so, uh, I'm sorry,
when would it start?

Is Monday morning too soon?

I, um-- well, it'd probably
seem like an eternity for him.

What time?
Uh, what time?

Uh, 7:45 should work.

The shelter opens at 8:00.

Yeah, okay.

We'll tell him.

Uh, Hayley,
thank you so much.

No, thank Todd.

Oh, uh,

there's one more thing.

There's a family asking
to adopt Christmas.

They saw him on the news.

They're-they're coming down
tomorrow.

Should I let him go?

Uh, yeah.

Yeah. I guess, yeah.

Well, if you change your mind
call me by 5:00 tonight.

Hayley, thank-thank you
so much for everything.

We're so proud.

Oh, you're more than welcome.

Well, okay. Yeah.

Bye-bye.

I told you.

What did you tell me?

Well, I-I was right.

Taking the dog back.

I mean...

teaching Todd to
deal with this

like an adult--
it paid off.

It was just like
-I hoped.
-Just like you...?

Our son

wasn't offered this job
because of anything you did.

It's because of what he did.

And making him take the dog back
was not some grand,

character-shaping event
for Todd.

You're a fool

for not keeping that dog.

[door closes]

GEORGE:
And I just wanted Todd
to understand

how important it is
he keep his word.

You know, and besides,
with the job

at the shelter, he's going to be
with dogs all day long.

Makes sense.

Hand me that lubricant,
would you?

You know, it's a big deal
Todd getting this job.

And I feel like I...

me caving in
is just a big step backward.

Sounds like you're trying to
convince yourself of something.

I could be wrong,

but Todd having this dog
or not having this dog

isn't going to make a blind
bit of difference,

not in the long run,
at least not to Todd.

Getting this dog would
be good for you.

It's not about me.

It isn't?

Seems to me this has everything
to do with you

and nothing to do with Todd.

You forget who
you're talking to?

I was here when
you were a boy

running around with
that dog of yours.

And I was here when you
got back from the war.

With a lid on things.

All bottled up.

Doesn't have to stay
that way forever.

You get to be my age,
you're going to regret it.

I don't think
it's such a bad thing

for you to let a dog
back in your life.

I suppose I could be wrong.

[horn honks]

Hi, Dad.

Hi.

Mom says that this
is her favorite color.

Oh.

Have you told him
about the call?

Not yet.

Why don't you
go ahead.

You have a job, starting Monday.

I do?

Mm-hmm.

At the shelter.

Yeah, Hayley
was so impressed

with the way you handled
the Christmas dog program

that I guess she wanted to
snap you up before somebody else

could get you.

Do I get to drive to work

on my own now?

I have my
learner's permit.

When you
get your license.

Can I use second gear?

Well, yeah. You'll learn
to use all the gears.

Thanks, Dad.

Oh, we're so proud
of you, Todd.

I'm really proud
of you.

Really proud.

And I've been thinking...

that with you
having a job,

things might get kind of lonely
for me around here.

I'm sorry, Dad.

No, it's-it's okay.

It's just that, uh...

You know the way
I always thought how...

family pets don't work out well
on a working farm and...

I don't think that anymore.

I think maybe I need a dog.

You know, keep me company
when you're at work.

What do you think?

I think Christmas would be
a really good dog for you.

Well, you're...

you're a good dog picker,
you know that?

Yes.

Yes, you are.

Well, I guess, then...

you should drive,

because I can't be
running you to and fro

when you have
this job all the time.

So, maybe you better...

Do we have to stay
in first gear the whole way?

No, we have to be there
before 5:00.

[Mary Ann laughing]

No, I'll teach you
how to shift into second.

[engine starting]

[gears grinding]


GEORGE: <i>No, keep... keep the clutch out.</i>

[gears grinding]
TODD: <i>
Uh-oh.</i>

<i>Keep the clutch out. That's it.</i>

<i>Foot off the brake.</i>

<i>Look at the road.</i>

<i>Like this? Yes.</i>

<i>Dad?</i>

<i>There's a turn
coming up.</i>

<i>That's it, that's it.</i>

<i>Foot off the brake.</i>

<i>That's it. Okay.</i>

<i>It's all right now.</i>

<i>Check your side mirror.</i>

Somebody's behind me.[horn honking]

Yeah, just let him
go by.

Okay.

<i>Slow down, slow down.</i>

<i>That's right. Good.[horn honking]</i>

Yep, that's good.
Bye!

Yeah, okay.

Good idea to stay
on the right-hand side.
Okay.

<i>Okay, clutch in.</i>

<i>Brake on.</i>

<i>I'm a good driver, huh?</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>I'll drive home.</i>

[bells ringing]

[dogs barking]

WOMAN:
I told you the fence needed
fixing two days ago.

HAYLEY:
I thought you were
going to take care of it.

With the holidays,
it was hard to get someone out.

GEORGE:
Hayley?

TODD:
Hayley?

I'll try again.

Mr. McCray, Todd.

Well, we're... we're here.

I'm sorry to have
to tell you this, but, uh...

there was a weak spot
in the dog run, and, um...

apparently,
Christmas found it.

He's gone?

He's gone.

Christmas ran away?

I'm so sorry.

Well, what...
what time was this?

Hours ago.

Jennifer's been looking
for him since about 2:30.

Could be anywhere
by now.

Mr. McCray, if he shows up,

I'll call you
straightaway.

You have my word.

Thank you, Hayley.

[dogs barking]


[engine starting]

Don't worry, Dad.

Christmas can take care
of himself.

That's the way it works
with him.

That's how it works
with him.

You just missed
Jean and Hank.

They came by to pick up
Ruthie and the puppies.

They're adopting them all.

What's wrong?
Where's Christmas?

Gone.

There was a hole
in the fence

at the shelter, and he ran away.

Oh, no.

Yeah. I'm sorry.

I'll take care
of the feeding tonight, Todd.

You just help your mom
with dinner.

Okay?

[horse whinnies]

[bell in ball jingles]



Hey.

Oh, where'd you come from?

Where'd you come from?

Hey. Hey.

You want to play fetch? Huh?

Is that what...
you want to play fetch?


Mmm.

Come on. Come here.[barks]

You ready?


Hey, Todd!

Todd!

Mary Ann!

Get out here now!

What is it?

I just thought of a way
to get Christmas to come back.

How?

Well, it's... it's easy.

All I... I just throw a ball,

and he'll fetch it.

What?

What ball?

That ball.


Christmas![barking]



Christmas!

Where did you go?
Where did you go?

How did you
get back here?

Come here, boy.


So, Christmas...

Came home.

[Christmas barking]

You are such a good boy,
Christmas.
Mm-hmm.

You're such
a good boy.

We were so worried.

GEORGE: <i>
He had come home to stay.</i>

<i>And the part of his journey</i>

<i>that could be measured in miles was over.</i>

<i>The rest of his journey--
with our family--</i>

<i>had only begun.</i>

Come back here.

You're such
a smart boy.

You're such a good dog,
Christmas.

I missed you.

Good boy, Christmas.

â™ª He's just a young boy
waiting â™ª

â™ª By his right hand

â™ª Is an empty space just as wide
as this old farmland â™ª

â™ª This old fool didn't go
yesterday â™ª

â™ª So when my boy looks back,
the picture he'll see â™ª

â™ª It feels so good
with you beside me â™ª

â™ª Summer days
that will never end â™ª

â™ª Time is as still
as the far horizon â™ª

â™ª When I am walking
with my best friend â™ª

â™ª I am walking
with my best friend. â™ª
