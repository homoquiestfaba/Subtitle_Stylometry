I gotta go to my car.

You're kidding me, right?
No... I'm sorry, man.

I'll be right back.

He's all right. Pencil pushers just
ain't used to getting their hands dirty.

Your boy's green.

He's a government lackey, but his
information's solid, man. The best.

In fact...

...I gotta go up on my finder's fee.

Your boy's gonna leave the scene, and
you're gonna hit me up for a bump?

It's only fair I get my cut.

Our business is done, for good.

Hey, don't fucking do that, man.

Don't ever fucking
lay your hands on me again!

Oh, shit.

Reyes!

Reyes.

Reyes.

B, pick up the fucking phone!

Hey, Jared, let me get a beer...

...and a Long Island Iced Tea.
Gotcha.

Yeah!

Come on, baby.
Don't be mad at me.

Come on, it's just a game, partner.
It's just a game, dog.

But I'm gonna beat that ass one day.

I like that about you.
You did your best, dog.

You know, keep practicing. Go on.

Hey, be good, baby.
All right, now.

Hey, hey, sexy woman, you in here?
So did you win again?

Come on, now. I own that court.
You know I did my thing.

Em, we're late.
Okay, I'm gonna be right on you.

But I had to whup Ray's butt
one more time.

Yeah, I figured.
Your tux is in the closet, all right?

I got an idea about that tuxedo thing.
You do?

I think I'm gonna rock my baby-blue
Jordans with it. What you think?

You are not wearing Jordans
with a tux!

I promise you, it will be sexy, girl.
I promise.

He just loves to drive me crazy.

Emery Simms. Emery?

It is so easy to push
my baby's buttons.

How easy?
This easy.

You smell a little funky.

Please. You love my funky ass
and you know this.

Yeah, I do.
Now, could you please hurry?

Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight is an exciting evening.

I'm proud to add yet another restaurant
to Atlanta's A list of fine dining.

And I'm truly honoured that you chose
to join us tonight in celebration.

So from the bottom of my heart,
I thank you for coming.

Now, my mother taught me
that privilege...

...is a privilege.

So in homage to her, I declare
that for the life of this restaurant...

...five percent of our revenue will be
donated to the Youth Advocacy Centre.

Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you so much.

This project is nearest and dearest
to my wife's heart.

If I may, I'd like to introduce
my wife to you.

The very beautiful, the very sexy...

...my baby, Mrs. Constance Simms.

Come on, now.
Tell me I made you proud.

Okay, if I have to.

Listen, you snatched up
that Niskey Lake property just in time.

If I'd had my ear to the ground...

...maybe you and I both
would've made a killing.

Or better yet, just me.
Maybe next time.

Hey, sweetie. Enjoy, ladies.

How you doing tonight?

What's going on?

We have uninvited guests.

A lot of shit in here.

What is this?
I don't know.

Look at this sad plaque,
probably bought it for himself.

Are we finding anything interesting?
Mr. Simms.

That's me.

I'm Detective Pierce. This is Detective
Morgan. Atlanta Police Department.

Nice office.
Thank you. I find it comfortable.

Raymond Wallace, Mr. Simms'
attorney. What's this about?

We wanted to ask your client
some questions.

Like if he knew a Kenneth Stroud.
Stroud.

I'm sorry, doesn't ring a bell.

You know what? Don't worry about it.
Happens to me all the time.

I never remember names,
but I'm always good with faces.

What about that, huh? Look familiar?

Wow.
Yeah. He's dead.

Indeed he is.

Well, that look familiar to you?

No. Not really.

No or not really?

No, detective.

We found a phone
next to the dead guy.

And it had your number
in the recent call list.

Well, that's interesting.

But isn't it possible that he could've
just called the wrong number?

Incoming recent calls.

I'm sorry. Did I forget that?

Isn't it possible I called
the wrong number?

Is my client being charged
with a crime, detective?

No, we're just trying to get
questions answered.

Trying to get some clarity here.
I'm one who does appreciate clarity.

But I apologize,
I can't help you with this.

You can tell us where you were...

We apologize for interrupting
your lovely party.

Thank you for your time, Mr. Simms.
My pleasure.

I do need to attend to my guests.

If you could leave me my pen and take
these pictures, I'd appreciate that.

Yes, of course.

Thanks.
Mr. Wallace.

Hey. What was that all about?

We need to talk.

Emery, you're not even listening.

I am listening to you.
I'm just tired, so please don't start.

If your five-percent pledge
had really come from your heart...

...it'd be different.

What is the problem?
This could work out in your favour.

Or it could backfire.
Wait. Just listen to me.

The restaurant does well,
that's a donation for your cause.

So you use the youth centre
to cast yourself in a better light?

Connie, you're panicking.
Don't patronize me, Emery.

I know the police came
to visit you tonight.

You wanna tell me
what that's all about?

Yeah.

Good night.

Oh, Ray, you are stupid.

Excuse me, sweetheart.

This might sound a little corny, but...
Yeah, I know.

You know me from someplace.

Other night, at your restaurant.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

That's right, at the opening.

Well, I don't think we ever got
formally introduced, now, did we?

Allannah James.
Emery Simms.

How is it we ended up running
into each other twice in one week?

I was interviewing for a position
at the tennis club.

As for the restaurant, well, you know,
ain't a party in Atlanta I can't get into.

Oh, is that right?
That's right. Trust me.

Okay. I think I like
your little style there.

That's good.
Yeah.

I think I like that a lot.

Well, here we are.

Thank you.
You're welcome. Wait a minute.

Just in case you ever find yourself
in need again.

Thank you...

...again.

Come in.

Russell's on line two,
I rescheduled lunch with Aaron...

...and there's an urgent message
from the printer.

Thanks, Anna.

He has another function that evening.
No way he'll make both.

These are underprivileged kids who've
managed to refocus their anger...

...into something constructive.

Surely the mayor can take the time
to honour that kind of dedication.

It's a recital, Constance.

It's an exhibition.

Say what you're not saying, Russ.
It's election year, sweetheart.

And your husband's
business dealings...

...don't exactly bring pride
to your family name.

I am not my husband. And he
has nothing to do with the centre.

Right. Five-percent donations aside,
of course.

Thank you.

Cell phone IDs are in.
And?

And seems as though our Mr. Stroud
was a busy bee.

He's been in touch
with the big house and Capitol Hill.

Well, were the calls spread out
or made all over the same day?

Looks like all on the same day,
except for two.

Simms and a Mark Reyes,
a numbers guy for the congressman.

Let me see that.

This coffee is shitty.

Well, the duration of the call to Simms
was five minutes and some change.

So much for it being a wrong number.
Time for a field trip. Let's roll.

Morning.

What the hell was that?
Payback.

Letrice is not happy about
your late-night creeping.

Okay, first of all,
nobody is creeping.

She's already freaked out
over this living situation.

You gotta be more considerate.
This ain't...

Yeah, yeah, I know.
This ain't Greenville. Got it.

Help me with this necklace,
smart-ass.

I got more assets than my ass,
you know.

Well, then, use them to help you get
to the bus station. I'm running late.

Pick up.
Okay.

You know, two in a bed,
riding on the bus.

Sure this ain't Greenville?
You are so stupid.

Package for you, Mr. Simms.
Thank you, Jamie.

Oh, no, she didn't.

This is Allannah James.
How can I help you?

Help me understand how a little
paperweight can have a large impact.

Did you like it?
Oh, yeah.

Yeah, I like it a lot. Thank you.
You're welcome.

Emery?

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.

Hey, listen.

I want you to have dinner
with me tonight.

Now, why would I want to do that?

And why wouldn't you do that?

I don't know.
Press says you a dangerous man.

You don't strike me as the type
of woman who scares easily.

I don't?
Baby, just have dinner with me.

Sheila's, downtown. It's on Ponce.
Parking's in the rear.

I'll make the reservation.

What up, player?
Hey.

Yo. I'm about to take a ride, so I don't
have to worry about anything, right?

I'm the manager, right?
Let me manage, you control freak.

Hey, hey. My bad. My bad.
I guess old habits die hard.

Handle your business, player.
Thank you, my brother.

I'm with you tonight, all right?
You're with me?

Got it.

All right. Make that money, player.
Come on, now.

You do look very nice tonight.

Thank you...

...again.

What was that?

Come on, now. Speak on.

You know, this could be
very, very wrong.

Meaning?

Meaning, my mama
didn't raise me like this.

Emery, you are very much
a married man...

...and I don't want you thinking of me
in that way.

Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
It's a little too late for that.

Besides, your mama can't be too mad.
We're just having dinner, right?

Well, hey, baby.
Hey.

I didn't think you'd still be up.

Just trying to get a jump-start
on tomorrow.

What about you? It's late.

Yeah, I know it is, baby.

We had a really good turnout
at the restaurant tonight.

Despite the bad press,
people still showed.

Good for you.

A lot of my heavy hitters have backed
out of attending the exhibition.

Without them, no funding.

Connie, I'm sorry.

I really thought they'd leave you
and the centre out of all this.

Yeah.

That's exactly what you thought.

What's up, Lannie?

What are you doing here, Derrick?
Looking for you.

You ain't made that too easy,
dipping out of state.

We don't have no more business
with each other, okay?

I don't have it.

Maybe you need to cash
in your scholarship.

I don't go here.
I'm just crashing with a friend.

Well...

...I'm willing to take a down payment,
as usual.

Those days are over.

You get me my money.

Or them days'll be back.

To winning the case.
To winning the case.

Look at them, man.

They think they're being funny.

Cops don't drink Hpnotiq.
I should sue them.

And give the press another story?

They've got nothing.

If Reyes was gonna talk,
he'd have talked.

And if Ren and Stimpy over there want
to play stakeout, what do you care?

I don't like being mocked, Brandon.
Ray said wait it out.

All right? So keep your cool.

Come on.

We've got some customers
to satisfy, all right?

Yeah.
He's sweating me.

Sure is.

She has got to go.

And I will do it no longer.
She's cool. All you have to do is...

I know it's late.

You know what, Allannah?
I'm in school.

And I have classes. Early ones.

I was not tripping about you staying
here. But you know what?

It was as long as we had our own
space, and you respected the fact...

...that folks have got to get
some sleep.

For the past couple of weeks,
you have been strolling in here...

...at 2 and 3:00 in the morning
consistently.

Okay, Letrice, whoa. I get it.

I'm not trying to be funny right now.
But you got it before tonight.

You know what? You don't need
to talk to me like I'm a 5-year-old.

I am a grown-ass woman.

You need to get your grown ass
and find someplace else to sleep.

Yeah, Emery Simms.

Okay, hey, hey, whoa.

Slow down, baby, slow down.
Slow down.

Just talk to me. What happened?

Okay. All right. Listen to me.

You tell me where you are,
and I will be right there.

Hey.

So this is where you live?

It's just temporary
till I get back on my feet.

Look, I can't let you stay here.
Emery, I'm fine.

You're fine?
Yeah.

Really. Then why'd you call me?

Listen.

I have a few vacant properties.
You can stay till things get better.

All right?
No.

No?
No.

I insist.

Hey. Look at me.

We'll just call it a loan.

No strings.

No strings?
No strings.

Okay.
Yeah?

Yeah?

That's my girl.

Yeah. Yeah.

You know, there ought to be a law
against somebody being this good.

I did my homework on that number
you found over at Stroud's place.

What'd you come up with?
It's an offshore account.

Any money?
How does half a million dollars sound?

That's good.
Thought so.

And the bulk of it was wired over
in stock transactions.

You run the stock transactions.

Find out which companies he invested
in for how much. Can you do that?

Okay. I think I see where you're going
with that.

Be right back. I'm getting on it.
Hey, Tamika.

Oh, shit.

So...

...what you think?

Allannah, you are kidding me.

You like it?
Hello.

Well, we're still
working some things out.

Like the security gate buzzer
keeps breaking...

...and we're still figuring out
our décor.

We? You sound like you're
setting up house with this man.

Are you thirsty?
What you got?

Orange juice, Coke or wine.

Wine.
Yeah, that's what I thought.

Gotta be old money, right?
What do you mean?

Allannah, look at this place.
This can't just be restaurant money.

What difference does it make?
It's temporary.

Here.

Small hole in the condom,
and it doesn't have to be.

Gwennie, you were the one who said,
"This ain't Greenville anymore." Right?

Tell me you haven't thought about it.

Drink your drink. You're much more fun
when you're buzzed.

Hey, it's Reyes.
I'm getting out of town.

But I know where to get some cash
before I go.

B, let it go. I'll give you
another chance to lose again.

You know I let you win so you could
look good in front of your friends.

Okay, whatever, player.
Yeah, right.

Yo, what's that?

This is Reyes.

The motherfucker
wants some money.

I'm sorry, but you gotta give
the guy points for creativity.

A Swiss bank account number
on a Swiss Alps postcard, that's balls.

B, this shit right here
means he's gonna talk.

He talks, he loses everything.

Look, he was there that night,
all right?

How's he gonna explain that?

The only way he can get you...
The only way is if you let him.

No, man. You know what,
I'll just pay him off.

Give him money,
make it go away forever.

Sometimes I think
you got too much damn money.

If you want to just give it away,
shit, give me some.

You don't think I should pay him off?
Hell, no.

As a matter of fact,
give me the fucking postcard.

Go on. All right? Don't sweat it.

All right. All right, it's done.

You're lying.
Shut up. You always do this.

You always say this.
And he's like, "Shut up."

Hey, baby.

That's Em. This is Gwen.

Say hi.
Hi.

Nice to meet you, Gwen.

Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
You want some wine?

I don't think there's any left,
Allannah.

Maybe I should go, because...

Yeah, maybe you should
wait outside.

I'm gonna drink a bottle of wine.
Okay.

You having fun, Allannah?
Yeah.

Do you really think it's smart
to parade people through here?

Emery, she's not "people."

She's my friend.

What, do I need to get permission
to have friends over now, huh?

What's wrong, baby?

Nothing. Nothing's wrong, Allannah.

Baby, I'm trying to help.
I don't really want your help, Allannah.

Then why are you here?

Yeah, Morgan.

Well, does anybody have any idea
on where he may have gone?

Okay. All right.
Well, keep me posted.

Well, looks like our friend
Mark Reyes is missing.

Nobody's seen him in days.

That's right around the time
that Stroud was murdered, right?

Yeah.
Look at these people.

Maybe we're chasing the wrong guy.

Maybe you're right.

This came by messenger.
Anything else come?

No, that's it.
Oh, okay.

Listen, I'm going over to the Alliance.
If Emery calls, tell him I'm running late.

Oh, he called
while you were on with Russell.

What did he say?
Excuse me?

I said, what did he say?

He said that he'll be late.

Are you all right?
I'm fine. Thanks.

Hey, shorty,
where your fucking boss at?

Pushy-ass people up in here.
Hey, where the manager at?

Who in charge here?
How can I help you? I'm the manager.

You? Why don't you help yourself
to some breath mints.

And go get your fucking boss.

Why don't you see if I can help you?
I don't wanna talk to you.

Get out of my face.
What's the problem?

I'm the owner. Can I help you?
Pretty boy. You the owner.

Yeah, I'm the owner.

Get your hands up off me.
Get off me!

What you gonna...?

Emery!
Get him out of here!

I ain't feel that, pretty boy.

You just stay the fuck away
from Allannah!

What in the hell
are you doing here, Derrick?

This is a phat crib, Allannah.

They do a credit check on you?

How did you get this address?
You know what's funny?

Just the other day you crying broke...

...but today you can afford all this.

It's a friend's.
I had a talk with that friend.

What kind of talk?

Man-to-man talk.

You better not have hurt him.

He got you thinking brand-new?
Get your hands off me.

I want in. I want in on the con.
This is not about the money.

It's always about the money.
This is different.

Why?

Dude got you laced?

You're nothing but a piece of ass
for him up here.

You on-call booty. Okay, Allannah?

Just more decoration for his condo.
I love him.

I love him in a way
that I will never love you.

You're not my husband anymore.
We're not partners in life anymore.

Which means...

...I don't owe you shit.

You always did have
too much mouth.

You owe me money.
I'll get it out your ass or your pocket...

...but either way,
I'm gonna get my money.

And you're gonna pay me
for as long as I say you will.

Here you go. I got you an ice pack.
It's fine.

Quit trying to be brave.
I don't need it.

It's gonna swell...
Are you listening?

This is just a little cut, so let it go.

Connie.

Baby, I can't do this tonight.
Do what, Emery?

What? Some man attacks you
out of the clear blue...

...and I'm the only concerned one.
He didn't attack me.

He just punched me. I walked up from
behind him so he would've hit anybody.

What if he comes back?
He won't.

How do you know?
Because he has no reason to.

You don't even know
why he came this time, Emery.

Connie, some punk came off the street
making a bunch of noise.

He could've been drunk,
he could've been high.

But the bottom line is I'm fine.
So let's just drop it.

You know what?

I'm sick and tired of being a wife to a
man who doesn't wanna be a husband.

Connie, come on.
Do you have to control everything?

Even the way I love you?
If it's not your way, then hell with it.

Even with the damn ice pack.
I said I was sorry.

Would you stop apologizing?
I'm getting so sick of your apologies.

After the 100th time,
they start to lose a little meaning.

Woman, what do you want me to do?
I want you to stop!

Just stop doing things that you're
gonna have to be sorry for later.

Just...

...stop.

Who is he?

Old drama.

How did old drama
become new drama, Allannah?

I don't know.

You sure about that?

You trying to say something?

I'm saying he knew
exactly where to find me.

He came to my business.
He found both of us.

Well, how?
I told you. I don't know.

Well, I need you to think
and think real hard.

I'm sorry, brother.

Do you care about you or me?
Jesus Christ!

Do you understand that I have
a hell of a lot to fucking lose?

Do you?

Shit.

What is this to you?

If I knew the answer to that, I'd be
the man I always dreamed of being.

That may be the first real thing
we have in common.

It's late, Allannah.

You don't have to go.

Look.

Stay. You stay as long
as you need to.

You just put the key in my corporate
office when you're ready to go.

Hey, baby, baby, baby.

Yeah, there she is.

Rise and shine.

Good morning to you.
Morning.

See, me?

I'm the type of man who believes
rainy days should be spent indoors.

Whoa, whoa.
Close your eyes, baby.

You don't see that. You don't see that.
That is all still a dream, baby.

Okay. Now you can open them.

I promise you it's raining out there,
all right? I want you to check this out.

Oh, yeah. You like that, don't you?
That's kind of nice, right?

What is this?

This...

...is just a little ambience
for my beautiful wife.

I have work to do, Emery.
Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey.

Just go in a little late today, that's all.
I can't. L...

Baby...

...last night...

...I heard you.

Oh, hey, hey.
Look at me, look at me. Please.

Baby, I'm serious.

I heard you.

And I promise you,
from this moment forward...

...no more apologies.

Come here.

Hey, there's my baby.
Hey, you.

Hey, so listen.

How do you feel about your man
taking his wife to lunch today?

What do you say?
You better.

That's right.

I've got to go, boy.
You better be ready for me, girl.

Oh, no, Allannah. I can't do this.

Okay, now that's just rude.

Hi.

Here I am.
Have you lost your mind?

This is my house.
What did you think, Emery?

That if you stop answering your
cell phone, that I would just go away?

Emery?
Hey. Hey, baby. What happened?

Did you forget something?
This was wedged in my car door.

It's got your name on it,
but that's it.

No address. Not even postage.

Let me see.

You know we've been getting a lot of
strange things since that bad press.

This is probably one of those things.
But at our house? It's kind of scary.

Well, Connie, anybody on the Internet
can get an address.

Hey.

All right?
Okay. I'm gonna get to work.

Lunch?
Lunch.

Lunch.
I'm coming to get you.

You're really cute with the wifey.

You are.

Why are you avoiding me?
I'll tell you why I'm avoiding you.

Because I'm working on my marriage.
You said you needed me!

No, I didn't.

Did you feel that way
when you were inside me?

Don't touch me.
Okay, woman, don't make this ugly.

This has always been ugly.

Don't you care?

Don't you care, Emery,
that I love you?

Get off me. Wait a minute. You what?
I love you.

You love me? Grow up, Allannah.

Listen to me.
We don't have a life together.

We have sex together.
We fuck, Allannah. All right?

I never said I was leaving Connie. And
you never asked me to. You know why?

Because everything you ever wanted
out of this between us you got.

Girl, I handed it right to you.

We both took advantage of each other,
so don't start playing violins on me.

It's desperate.

I think you're a little more
creative than that.

What do we got?
Dead lawyer making millions...

...off of insider trading scams.
He was probably very good at it.

But maybe he was trying to be better.
Get bigger companies, and for that...

...he would need a lot more cash.
Yeah.

That is where Simms comes in.
Let me ask you a question.

What's one of the biggest corporations
in America? Don't say Microsoft.

Federal government?
Bingo.

So you have a corrupt numbers guy
working at a congressman's office.

How much information
could he give you?

Oh, so you're saying Reyes...

...was to supply Stroud
with information for Simms.

So he could buy into a subsidized
government company.

Exactly. But something went wrong.
Yeah. Dead wrong.

Can you pencil me in
for dinner tonight?

No restaurant business tonight?

No. I promise you
I'm all yours if you'll have me.

Then I'll see you for dinner then.
All right, baby. Bye.

Don't get all weird.
Nobody's stalking you.

I just need to talk to you.

So talk, Allannah.

I'm pregnant.

You can follow me to the bathroom
or we can do it right here.

I'm not lying.

You're pregnant?

Allannah, why didn't you tell me
this before?

I don't know, Emery.
Maybe I was too busy growing up.

Okay. What do you want from me?
Do you want money?

If you want me to kill it.

Do you want me to kill it?

This doesn't have
anything to do with me.

I know. You're right.

This is about us.

I'll get you the money.

"I know he's here, Russell.

Because as much as I adore you...

...you are not my only in.

And I do intend to see Mayor Bailey...

...today."

Ten minutes later, I was in his office.

That right there is how you make
it happen in this game.

The mayor's coming to the exhibition?
Ain't that what I just said?

Well, all right.
Congratulations, Connie.

Welcome to the big leagues.
Welcome to the big leagues?

Well, ain't that what I just said?

Is that it?

Woman, don't ever test me like that.
Get your fine self over here.

I know the great Emery Simms
can do much better than that.

Yes, I can.

What's up?
What's up.

Busy?
No, just cleaning up, man.

Trying to get all this stuff moved in.
This is how you spend your days off?

Nope. Normally I'm doing overtime
for my pain-in-the-ass boss.

You got jokes?
That ain't funny, bro.

Here you go.
What do you want me to do with that?

No spectators. Get to work.
You can start right there.

Oh, you tripping. You know that, right?
Yep.

What the hell is all this mess anyway?

Trash or treasure, my brother.
Today's mission is to figure out which.

Oh, hell, no. This isn't what I think it...
I thought you burned this a long time...

What are you doing
holding on to this, man?

Memories, baby.

Eighty-seven.

Oh, wait a minute.

Hey, bro.

You was one funny-Iooking cat
back in the day. Damn.

They say we looked alike.
Whatever. That is why...

...you stayed a virgin in school.
That's all right. That's all right.

Look at that.

Oh, Connie.

It's all under control now, right?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, everything's cool.

Allannah's going to the clinic Monday.
You going?

No. Hell, no.
She doesn't want me to go.

Oh, you don't wanna go
anyway, man.

Abortions don't always
solve the problem.

What?

Man, we all got one who got away.

Who?
Why you all up in my Kool-Aid for?

I don't tell you everything.
That's bullshit. I tell you my business.

You're sensitive.
You a punk sometimes.

Whatever with you.

Hey, B.

This shit's getting crazy, man.

I don't know, man. I'm looking
for peace, you know what I'm saying?

From Reyes, from Allannah.

I mean, I just need some damn peace.

Hey, if the guy's causing you
that much trouble...

...$250,000 for your peace of mind,
maybe you should just pay him off.

Yeah.

Yeah, maybe I should.

Hey, look...

...I'm gonna bounce.
Where you going?

I'm gonna go home.

You just gonna bail on me like that.
Hell, yeah. Watch.

See. I knew you was
just about yourself. It's all right.

It's nice.

What's nice, baby?

Just making some final decisions
on pieces for the exhibition.

Yeah?

I have a piece.

You do?
Yeah, I do.

Roses are red

This is original.

Violets are blue

And I'm a terrible poet.
Oh, you got that right.

But in spite of everything, Connie...

...know that I love you.

Hey.

Hi.

I didn't do it.

Emery. I know. I know
that you're not only with me for sex.

I know that, and the baby
is proof of that.

And it's worth more than the cost
of an abortion.

I'm gonna say this to you one time.

You cannot roll with the big dogs, so
don't play this bullshit game with me.

Emery, I rolled around
with the biggest dog of them all.

You don't scare me.

You get your little trifling ass
out of my condo, you hear me?

As of right now, you are out of my life.
You never fucking existed.

Emery.

Emery, I'm sorry.

Goodbye, Allannah.

Emery!

Emery, baby, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm saying.

Emery!

I'm not a bad person.

I'm not even a mean person.

Because even with what you think
you know...

...about me,
you don't really "know me" know me.

You know, and no one says
that you have to trust me.

It would mak e things a lot easier
for both of us if you could.

Because I don't really
want to hurt anybody.

And I don't wanna be hurt either.

I'm gonna be a mother now.

I'm gonna be a mom.

And that affects...

...both of us. This child...

This child, it was conceived in love.

Now, you may not have
any love for it, but I do.

But that doesn't mean
that you get to walk away.

You have as much responsibility
in this as I do.

You really can make things
a lot easier for all of us.

Senator, gentlemen,
I apologize for being late.

Not a problem. Have a seat.

Constance.

I think it's time we were women
about this.

Baby, what are you doing?

Figure it out.

Connie, why are you packing?

I'm not going to ask what I did,
because this is so not about me.

This is about you and your
"God amongst mortals" mentality.

Thinking you can do whatever you want
and get away with it.

Well, you can't, Emery.

Okay, whoa, whoa. Slow down
for a minute.

Talk to me. What happened?

Why don't you ask your
little girlfriend? We really bonded.

Right after she lured me
to Piedmont Park.

To share your good news.

It's rather apropos that a bastard
should father one.

No, I don't wanna hear shit.

It wasn't enough for you to bang
some little gold-digging 'hood rat.

Do you know that she asked me
for money? And I gave it to her.

I gave her a check for 100 grand.

Do you want to know why I paid her?

Because she must have something
that I don't have...

...for you to get her pregnant.

The one thing that you never agreed
to do with me.

Shit!
Okay, all right. Let me help you.

No, don't!

Baby, just listen to me.
Why? So you can deny it?

Come on, Emery. Deny it.

Do some damage control.
Put a good spin on it.

She's not pregnant, Connie.

Fuck you.

Where the fuck you going, huh?
Derrick, stop it!

I want my cut!
Get away from me.

I don't give a shit! Now, where is it?

I told you, I need more time.
Well, you out of time.

Get your ass in here.
You're hurting me. Stop it.

I'm not playing. I want my money!

What? What?
Okay, stop it.

Okay?

Yeah, see, that pretty boy
don't know how you like it.

But I do, right?
Right.

That's right.
You're so good.

Hell, yeah.
I see this.

That's the Allannah I know. Yeah.
Remember that?

That's what I'm talking about though.
This is better than money, right?

Say it.
Okay.

It's better than money.

You dirty bitch.

You know why
I don't like gangsters?

Why?

Because they think they
can bullshit their way out of anything.

Even murder.
This ain't on me.

I ain't the dude
you need to be drilling.

What about those?

Get that out of here.
I don't wanna see that.

What's the matter?
You're not proud of your handiwork?

I'm telling you,
she was very much alive when I left.

And you certainly knew how alive
she could get, huh, Mr. Simms?

Try to display some tact, detective.

This is a homicide investigation,
not a beauty pageant.

Therefore the questions
are a bit more difficult.

Detective, she was alive.

Before you left.
When I left.

What about before you left?
We was talking.

About what?
About our relationship.

Trying to patch things up.
I was trying to break it off with her.

Like her clothing. They were ripped.
I don't know nothing about that.

You didn't rip her clothes?
No, that's not why it was ripped.

You positive?
Maybe she did it herself. I don't know.

How?

When I walked in,
they were having sex.

So you got jealous.
You got angry. Shit happens.

So what? I got angry. You're right.
But that doesn't mean I killed anybody.

Did you really think you could play me?

The two of you better
get the fuck out right now.

No, baby. It's not what you think.

It's not what I think?
I think he's trying to fuck you.

It is what you think. I am fucking her.
No, shut up!

I don't want any excuses. Give me my
keys, that check, and get the fuck out!

Check? What check?
Look here, little man.

You tried me once.
You want it to happen again?

You motherfucker. What check?
Do something.

You know what? Stop it, both of you.

Derrick, why don't we just leave?

You might wanna listen
to your girlfriend. But you know what?

You ain't going till
I get my money.

Hey.
No, hey, nothing.

That check, motherfucker.
Now say something.

You little backstabbing...

Yeah, see, I owed you that.
Now, raise up and get...

She ran out on me.
Did you catch her?

No, I didn't. She was long gone.

I'm telling you, I went home
and called my accountant...

...so I could stop payment
on that check. That is it!

Look, we was chilling, okay?
All right?

Just catching up on some things.

The next thing I know,
dude come rushing in.

Simms?
Yeah, Simms.

He gonna ask us to leave his spot.
Okay, I respect that.

It's yours. I'll dip out.
But then he gonna punch me?

You little backstabbing little bitch.

Yeah, see I owed you that one. Now...

Fuck you talking about?

What happened to Allannah?
I don't know.

Okay? Last I saw her,
she ran out the condo.

You murdered her in the condo.

Last time I saw her, she was alive
when she left the condo.

Sit down. Sit the fuck down!

Y'all are gonna swarm on me.

All right? Pull my car over and pull me
down here. That's what happened.

But you admit that you were trying
to con Simms out of the money.

It wasn't even about Simms.

What about the knife?

What about it?

It had your prints on it, Derrick.

What's happening? Why is he leaving?
We can't hold him, Miss Caplan.

Why?
Not enough evidence. Relax.

Yo, Simms!

Think I'm gonna burn for you?
You killed my wife.

You're a dead motherfucker, do you
hear me? A rich, dead motherfucker!

Emery, we should leave.

Yeah.

Brandon.
Connie.

Why weren't you there for him?
What could I have done?

I'm trying.
I'm here.

Connie.

You okay?

Connie, I know a lot has happened.
Why don't we skip this part?

I'm afraid if we do, you'll get
in the car and leave for good.

I haven't taken my bags out of the car,
and we have an event tonight.

An event?

The exhibition at the Youth Centre?

Yeah, I know. You forgot.

I'm the director of the centre.
I have to go. I'll get your tux.

Connie, I didn't do it.

I know.

I'm no saint, Emery.

It's just not your style to do this.

I just don't care anymore.

You try to be a good person,
a good wife.

Support your husband,
make him wanna come home.

Make him proud to have you
on his arm.

But some days it gets hard
to smile through the bullshit.

But you do.

You just do it.

For 11 years, you find ways
to make it work.

And then suddenly...

...it's just not enough.

And you start to lose control.

You start having these sick thoughts.

And sooner or later...

...you're the psycho in the scenario.

Emery...

...would you bring my bags in? Please?

Emery.

Yeah. What's up, baby?
What are you doing?

I thought I left one of your bags
in the car, so I went to go check.

You need to hurry.
I don't wanna be late.

Connie...

...why'd you come back so soon?

I put a lot of work into this marriage,
and this is my home.

I've earned my place. I wasn't gonna let
anyone take that away from me.

Look, baby.

I don't think I'm gonna go.

No one's coming after you.
The police are satisfied.

Why don't we just move on?

Baby, I just need you to give me
tonight, all right?

Look, I need a second to come down off
of all this, you know what I'm saying?

Fine.

What the fuck?

Oh, shit.

Fuck!

What's up, B?
Yo, yo, what's up?

What's the matter with you, man?

You're gonna think I've lost my mind.
Well, I thought that years ago.

All right, man. Go ahead. Speak on.

I think Connie may have
hurt Allannah, man.

Want a beer?
Did you hear what I just said?

What makes you think Connie
would be some kind of murderer?

Don't even say it like that.
It's a little late to get squeamish.

Listen, it's just the things
she's been saying.

I've never heard that woman
talk like that, ever.

Man, look, that's a heavy accusation
off of some words, man.

What are you thinking about doing?

I don't know. I don't know
what the fuck to do, man.

I don't know if she really did it,
but if she did, it would be my fault.

I couldn't blame her for it.
But how do I live with a woman...

...who would do
some crazy shit like that?

I'll need something heavier to drink
if we're gonna have this conversation.

Come on, B, you're my boy,
and I need you. Tell me something.

Tell me I'm overreacting. Something.
You are so fucking stupid.

Just look at you, man.
Everything you've done.

Everything you have,
somebody gave to you.

Your money. Inherited, not earned.
Your business...

...you don't even know
how to run, I do it.

Your wife. The best thing
that ever happened to you.

You can't even get that on your own!
You steal her from me.

What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm glad you asked, motherfucker.

I'm about to get her back.

Now, you listen to me,
you sorry little motherfucker.

Your little plan has got a hole in it,
because Connie, she's my wife!

We are still together, and we are
gonna stay together. Believe that!

You walk around like you're
so much better than everyone else.

You are no saint, Emery.

You killed Stroud and you covered it.
And you killed Allannah.

Derrick's gonna take the fall for that
because you set it up.

If you come near me or my wife,
if I ever see you again...

...I swear before God,
you are a dead man.

Is that right? Why wait that long?

Wait!

You want to kill me? How many people
saw you come in here?

Two or three maybe?

You ever fuck with me again,
I will kill you. Believe that!

To our esteemed mayor
and other distinguished guests...

...I want to thank you so much
for sharing this extraordinary evening.

Ladies and gentlemen,
our next artist, M'Kai Marks.

I present you with my manhood
My man's hood

My cloak of detachment
That shows my faces I walk on

Mistak enly, thinking I could do it alone

It's only now that I see
That without you

I'm simply without
So about is the face I turn

Away from the madness
That I learned to accept is true

Dropping my hood
Revealing the man

Newly subdued
By renewed dev otion to you

Thank you.

Emery's under arrest.
You got nothing on me.

Back off.
I've cleared myself.

Wait! Wait! You can't do this to me.
I didn't kill anybody.

I cleared myself. Baby, this is a
mistake. I promise you. I promise you.

You know you got the wrong man.

Hey, boy, let me get some
of that brown sugar.

Look at this pretty motherfucker.

Baby...

No, baby, what the hell is this?

You don't want a divorce, do you?
There are ways to do this without you.

Listen to me. I told you, I did not kill
that woman. You have to believe that.

I need to move on, Emery.

Connie, no, don't do this to me.
Don't do this to us.

Sign the fucking papers, Emery.

Just sign them.

Baby, what are you doing?

Woman, you used to believe in me.

Belief is intangible. Don't pretend
you know anything about it.

I stopped believing
your conspiracy theories...

...right after they found the box cutter.

What box cutter?
Goodbye, Emery.

Connie, I don't know anything...
Pick up the phone.

Pick up the phone! Connie.
Connie, don't leave me like this!

Fuck!

Come on, Simms. This way.

Hey.

Come on, Simms.

Brandon. Brandon, this was you!
You did this to me!

You did this to me with the box cutter!
That was you!

Baby, it's him! I didn't do this!
I didn't kill nobody!

You better break me out of this,
motherfucker! Let me go!

Baby! Baby, I didn't kill nobody! Baby!

Fuck!

Hey, Jared, let me get a beer
and a Long Island Iced Tea.

Wear something tight.

He's good-Iooking.
Then it should be an easy fuck.

But don't get it twisted.
He's not the mark.

Who is?

His wife.

That'll never work.

You do this right, she'll pay you
just to get rid of you.

It's all his money anyway.

Trust me.

I know these people.

So word is your wife
has a new little boyfriend.

Whose word is that?
Mine.

And who the fuck are you?
Let's just say...

...I'm a little birdie with some names
you may be interested in.

All right, little birdie, sing.
