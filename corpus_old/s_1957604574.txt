a dark and hot place.</i>

<i>It's a theater.</i>

[metal clanging]

<i>The one in</i><i>
the student center...</i>

[metal clanging]


<i>I was taking a nap</i><i>
up in the wait bay,</i>

<i>but with all the lights on,</i><i>
the stage gets hot.</i>

<i>My Physics professor,</i><i>
Dr. Von Nuremberg,</i>

<i>says that being hot</i><i>
makes it less dense,</i>

<i>so it rises up from</i><i>
the floor</i>

<i>and into the rafters</i><i>
of the theater.</i>

-[indistinct chatter] <i>
-There's perfume in the air.</i>

<i>Lots of it.</i>

<i>All the different kinds that</i><i>
people wear mix together</i>

<i>and float up on the thermal</i><i>
from the stage.</i>

<i>It's enough to</i><i>
make you dizzy.</i>

<i>It's because of all the girls</i><i>
down in the audience.</i>

<i>Perfume makes me dizzy,</i><i>
period.</i>

<i>It's a buzz.</i><i>
Like being stoned.</i>

<i>But it doesn't make talking to</i><i>
girls very easy.</i>

<i>Ivory soap, Noxzema,</i>

<i>even Tide is</i><i>
a difficult situation.</i>

<i>Perfume: rising and mixing.</i>

<i>At the top of the rafters,</i>

<i>there must be</i><i>
a permanent layer of it.</i>

<i>Maybe like the ozone layer.</i>

<i>Well, except that</i><i>
it would smell</i>

<i>a whole hell of a lot better</i><i>
than the ozone layer,</i>

<i>which I always imagine</i><i>
smelling a lot like</i>

<i>your slot car set</i><i>
when you ran it too long.</i>

[woman whispering]
Ozone.

The scent of ozone.

<i>Maybe if more people were into</i><i>
slot car racing,</i>

<i>we wouldn't have</i><i>
all this trouble with</i>

<i>all those sheep going blind</i><i>
in Argentina or Panama...</i>

<i>or Portugal or</i><i>
wherever it was</i>

<i>that my Systems professor was</i><i>
talking about last week.</i>

<i>Most people have no idea</i><i>
how big a theater is.</i>

<i>Theaters are like icebergs.</i>

<i>Or at least they're like what</i><i>
books say icebergs are like.</i>

[indistinct chatter]

<i>I've never actually</i><i>
seen an iceberg.</i>

<i>Well, it's not like I haven't</i><i>
seen icebergs on</i>

<i>the Discovery Channel.</i>

<i>What I'm getting at is that</i>

<i>you can only see a little bit</i><i>
of the iceberg,</i>

<i>and the rest is submerged.</i>

<i>Just like you can only see</i><i>
a little bit of the theater,</i>

<i>the house and the stage.</i>

<i>I don't mean that</i><i>
it's cold or anything.</i>

<i>The catwalks are way too hot</i>

<i>for the theater to be cold</i><i>
like an iceberg.</i>

<i>Except maybe when Gene turns up</i><i>
the A/C in the summer.</i>

<i>He always uses</i><i>
way too much A/C.</i>

<i>You have to walk to the theater</i><i>
in your long pants</i>

<i>and you fry the whole way.</i>

<i>And the cats never cool off,</i>

<i>because all the cold air</i><i>
drops out of the ducts</i>

<i>and pools in the house.</i>

What a piece of work is a man.

How noble in reason.

How infinite in faculty.

In form, in moving,
how express and admirable.

In action,
how like an angel.

In apprehension,
how like a god.

The beauty of the world.

The paragon of animals.

The paragon of the world.

<i>You only see the stage.</i>

<i>And only the stuff</i><i>
happening on</i>

<i>Everything else</i><i>
is in the dark.</i>

<i>You can see the exit signs.</i>

<i>But there's all sorts of stuff</i><i>
up there just... hanging.</i>

[indistinct chatter]

<i>Clusters of speakers,</i><i>
cloud cluster, voice of God,</i>

<i>and the new JBLs</i><i>
we got last week.</i>

<i>It's all hanging from this</i><i>
orange nylon daisy chain stuff</i>

<i>All these different lights,</i><i>
you know:</i>

<i>6x9, 6x12, 6x16,</i>

<i>Fresnel, baby Fresnels,</i><i>
Canons, Par Cans,</i>

<i>scoops, works,</i><i>
Xenon arc spots...</i>

<i>There are all these rooms</i><i>
up there:</i>

<i>Sound room, CD deck,</i>

Nakamichi 4-head,</i>

<i>MidiVerb,</i><i>
24-channel mixing board,</i>

<i>Clear-Com base...</i>

<i>Digital EQ, mics,</i>

<i>57s, 58s, PZMs, PCCS.</i>

<i>Which sounds like a weapon</i><i>
from Cluster Invective,</i>

<i>but it's just a mic.</i>

<i>Shotgun, amp rack,</i>

<i>Crown and QSCs, patch board,</i>

<i>the old VOT,</i>

<i>gel library of</i><i>
nine zillion different colors,</i>

<i>Roscolux and GamColor,</i>

<i>and those little metal things</i><i>
you put in the 6x9s</i>

<i>to make patterns.</i>

<i>I don't remember what</i><i>
those are called.</i>

<i>I'll ask Samantha later.</i>

<i>The light room,</i><i>
the two light computer things,</i>

<i>uh, the house panic</i><i>

<i>scoops and work box,</i>

<i>the tech director's booth,</i>

<i>projection room,</i><i>
follow spot room, the office,</i>

<i>the tech lounge,</i>

<i>the design room,</i><i>

<i>catwalks, fly rail, pin rail.</i>

<i>All of that is hanging</i><i>
over your head,</i>

<i>every time you</i><i>
step into the theater.</i>

<i>You just can't see it.</i>

<i>It's in the dark,</i><i>
just over your head.</i>

<i>And in order for that</i><i>
one-man show about</i>

<i>St. Sebastian to come off,</i>

<i>all sorts of action</i><i>
has to happen.</i>

<i>Out of sight, like an iceberg,</i><i>
but upside-down.</i>

<i>I can't believe they shot</i><i>
that guy full of arrows,</i>

<i>right there on stage.</i>

<i>He got the audience to do it.</i>

<i>He handed out bows and arrows</i><i>
to the first three rows.</i>

<i>All these profs</i><i>
in suits and ties,</i>

<i>winging arrows at this</i><i>

[female announcer] <i>
Good afternoon, ladies,</i>

<i>and welcome to the Third Annual</i><i>
Pan- Hellenic Fashion Show,</i>

<i>"Hamlet: Fashion of Thought,</i><i>
Fashion of Action."</i>

<i>-I don't feel so hot.</i>
-[boy] Hi, Jay!

<i>I haven't felt right all day.</i>

<i>I think it's because I don't</i><i>
eat enough fresh foods.</i>

<i>I mostly eat complex</i><i>
carbohydrates,</i>

<i>pastas and breads.</i>

<i>That stuff keeps good</i><i>
in the dorm.</i>

<i>I mean,</i><i>
I'm kinda up and down:</i>

<i>energy, no energy.</i>

<i>Back and forth.</i>


<i>I think my immune system</i><i>
hates me.</i>

-[boy] Yeah! <i>
-It's because I live</i><i>
like a rat.</i>

Okay, be right there.

<i>Well, that's what</i><i>
my dad thinks.</i>

Come on, guys, we gotta go
back to work...

<i>I'd feel better</i><i>
if I had a Coke.</i>

<i>A Coke would get my</i><i>
metabolic rate up</i>

<i>and help my body defeat</i><i>
this bug I think I've got.</i>

<i>I heard that on the radio.</i>

<i>It would elevate my heart rate</i><i>
and that would mean</i>

<i>I'd be getting more oxygen</i><i>
to my issues.</i>

<i>And I read most bacteria that</i><i>
make you sick are anaerobic.</i>

<i>So if I had more oxygen</i><i>
in my tissues,</i>

<i>I wouldn't be sick.</i>

<i>Maybe that's why Americans</i><i>
are so healthy.</i>

<i>We drink more Coke than</i><i>
any other nation on Earth.</i>

[seagulls calling]

<i>We have more energy.</i>

<i>I think that's why we're</i><i>
so keen on building stuff</i>

<i>and going places.</i>

<i>We've got a lot of oxygen</i><i>
and we're tall.</i>

<i>Of course,</i><i>
if it really is a virus,</i>

<i>the oxygen won't do me</i><i>
any good</i>

<i>because viruses</i><i>
aren't really alive.</i>

<i>I'm working this call</i><i>
signed up on follow spot.</i>

<i>Of course, the show</i><i>
doesn't need any follow spot,</i>

<i>so I'm just dead weight</i><i>
on this call.</i>

[keyboard clacking]

<i>John is on the computer</i><i>
playing Cluster Invective,</i>

<i>which is definitely</i><i>
the tech crew's favorite game.</i>

<i>Gene, our tech director,</i>

<i>he got the computer</i><i>
to keep records and stuff.</i>

<i>Cluster's this sort of</i><i>
virtual reality deal where</i>

<i>you're a pilot of this</i><i>
giant war robot</i>

<i>and you have to crush</i><i>
all resistance</i>

<i>on this technologically</i><i>
backwards planet.</i>

<i>The graphics for</i><i>

<i>are really awesome.</i>

<i>It's got these cows running</i><i>
around everywhere.</i>

[keyboard clacking]

[indistinct video game chatter]

Hey, John.
How's it going?

Well, pretty good.

Except the fucking Xenos
have me pinned down

on top of Hill 169-er.

I tried calling in for
air support

from the HK wing
at fire base Ant Hill,

but the tac daemon
keeps sending me

the request denied protocol.

Shit.

Oh, hey!
Did you route that request

through standard mil-ops
narivan

or did you use
the drop switch repeater

on the satellite uplink
on Valkyrie-Net?

Uh, no, I used mil-ops.

Oh, well see, half the time,
the sorters on mil-ops

are working on tactical data
that's like over a week old,

so they don't think there's any
reason to send in air support.

Um, that's why I use
Valkyrie-Net,

I mean, just go ahead,
control-alt-shift-F7.

That'll, uh, scramble in
the HKs in about five minutes.

Okay...

[indistinct video game chatter]

Wow!
Thanks a lot, Jay!

Hey, you still need help on
that calculus homework?

Oh, yeah!

Nah, we got a test in there
next week

and I'm really lost.

Like, F of N over X or
something like that.

Okay, then.

All right.

the theater's a student,</i>

<i>except for Gene,</i>

<i>so we all have a lot of</i><i>
the same likes and dislikes.</i>

<i>That, and we all have names</i><i>
that start with "J,"</i>

<i>which I guess is</i><i>
sort of strange.</i>

<i>Though I never really</i><i>
thought about it until now.</i>

<i>When I step inside</i><i>
the tech booth,</i>

<i>Jamey, Jim and Jamin are all</i><i>
looking down at the audience</i>

<i>with binoculars.</i>

<i>It's a sorority fashion show,</i>

the king</i>

<i>and everybody's dead,</i><i>

<i>or her pal,</i><i>
since it's all girls.</i>

<i>I seem to remember</i><i>
reading about how</i>

<i>all the actors in</i><i>
Shakespeare's time were women.</i>

<i>I guess to draw a big crowd.</i>

<i>Like those places</i><i>
over by the air base.</i>

Max!

Hello there, Jay!

What brings you
to the snack bar?

and there's Dr. Boaz,</i>

<i>my Systems Thinking professor.</i>

<i>I have to take this</i><i>
Systems Thinking class</i>

<i>because I'm undesignated,</i>

<i>which doesn't mean that</i><i>
people don't know what I am,</i>

<i>it's just that I don't know</i><i>
what I'm gonna major in.</i>

<i>Maybe Philosophy.</i>

<i>Well anyway, Dr. Boaz</i><i>
wants us all to call him Max</i>

<i>'cause that's his</i><i>
first name and...</i>

<i>he's one of those professors.</i>

<i>He's a tall guy,</i><i>
like 6 1/2 feet tall</i>

<i>and moves like one of</i><i>
those thin man hunter-killers</i>

<i>from Cluster Invective.</i>

<i>Like a morph between that</i><i>
and a-- a Vulcan.</i>

<i>He wears those</i><i>
photo-sensitive eye glasses.</i>

<i>The kind that never actually</i><i>
get all the way untinted.</i>

<i>Dr. Boaz is really cool.</i>

<i>I'm sure he smoked pot</i><i>
back in the '60s.</i>

<i>He told our class about</i><i>
all these sensory-deprivation</i><i>
experiments</i>

<i>he and his pals did</i><i>
in graduate school.</i>

<i>They had this big tank.</i>

<i>He said it looked like one of</i><i>
those hot water heaters</i>

<i>with one of those</i><i>
submarine hatches on top,</i>

<i>the kind with</i><i>
the wheel you turn.</i>

<i>And the tank was filled with</i><i>
this saline solution</i>

<i>that they kept heated at</i><i>
a steady 98.7.</i>

<i>You breathed off this</i><i>
scuba helmet</i>

<i>and they kept the inside</i><i>
of the tank totally dark.</i>

<i>After a copy of hours,</i>

<i>people would start talking</i><i>
to their dead grandparents</i>

<i>and say all this stuff about</i><i>
Mark Twain</i>

<i>being nailed up</i><i>
on the cross.</i>

<i>And you could hear it</i><i>
all over this mic feed</i>

<i>they had in the helmet.</i>

<i>Well, one day,</i><i>
this guy crawls into the tank,</i>

<i>and he just doesn't come out.</i>

<i>They just couldn't find him.</i><i>
He vanished.</i>

<i>So the university gets</i><i>
all pissed off</i>

<i>and they have to stop</i><i>
the project with the tank.</i>

<i>Weird, huh?</i>

<i>Dr. Boaz said they made</i><i>
that movie, </i>Altered States,

<i>based on the stuff</i><i>
they did with the tank.</i>

<i>Jack, this Computer Science guy</i><i>
in my suite,</i>

<i>and all his hacker pals</i><i>
drop acid</i>

<i>and watch that movie</i><i>
over and over.</i>

<i>They tried to make</i><i>
one of those tanks</i><i>
in our shower</i>

<i>with duct tape</i><i>
and trash bags,</i>

<i>but it busted and flooded out</i><i>
the study lounge next door.</i>

<i>Boy, did they</i><i>
catch hell for that.</i>

<i>They all have Boaz</i><i>
for their A.I. classes.</i>

-[siren blaring]
-[man] All right, everybody,
show's over! Show is over!


nothing much,
I was just gonna buy something.

Something in particular?
Or just a personal need
to move capital?

Trickle-down
micro-economics?

Or a bold move to seize
a market singularity?


Nothing that fancy,
Dr. Boaz. Oh--

Max!

I was--
I was just gonna get a Coke.

But sometimes I do
come down here, you know,

just wanting
to buy something.

Yes.
We can't help ourselves.

Money is movement.

Emerging out
of system complexity.

It's fluid dynamics
and turbulent flow.

Our wallets have
a predisposition toward
meaningful action.

An auto-poetic impulse.

Wow!

Wow, that makes me feel better.

or from the fountain?

Oh, in the bottle.

In a plastic bottle?

I find the drink has
a better taste

in the plastic bottle.

Oh. Wow, you, too?
I-- I like it a lot better

in the plastic bottle than in
the can or from the fountain.

I'm almost certain it has
something to do with

long-chain
polymer off-gassing.

Wow.

Polymers. Yeah.

-[Velcro ripping]
-Oh, look, Jay.

Compared to you, I'm loaded.
I'm a professor.

Let me spring for the Coke.

Oh, thanks, Max!

[coins clatter]

So he gets two 20 oz. cokes</i>

<i>in the injection-molded</i><i>
PVC bottles</i>

<i>and we walk outside.</i>

Jay. Where you headed?

Oh. Over there.

Good, I'm going your way.
Let's walk.

I wanna open my Coke,</i>

<i>but I notice that</i><i>
he's just holding his</i>

<i>with the cap still on.</i>

<i>I figure it would be impolite</i><i>
or something to open mine,</i>

<i>so...</i><i>
I just hold mine, too.</i>

[birds chirping]

<i>So Boaz and I are just</i><i>
strolling along,</i>

<i>holding our Cokes,</i>

<i>and it's about 3:30</i><i>
in the afternoon.</i>

<i>People are rolling past</i><i>
on their mountain bikes.</i>

<i>It's real comfortable out,</i>

<i>so most of the girls</i><i>
are wearing shorts,</i>

<i>so I'm trying really hard</i><i>
to pay attention to Boaz.</i>

<i>As he was nice enough to buy me</i><i>
the Coke and everything.</i>


over to the computing center

to bag some main frame time

for this little virtual reality
number I'm working on.

What kinda VR deal is it?

The Tiger Mound Incident.

Cluster Invective?

You programmed that?
I mean--

That's my favorite game.
It's super-real!

You coded that?
I mean, the cows!

And I must say,

this one's got a gem of
a random violence algorithm.

Line-of-sight microwave link.
I'm adding those to Cluster 2.


Aren't those for
secure point-to-point
ground communication?

as a matter of fact.


If those are up, I bet that's
a complete battlefield edge.

my young friend.

That's the lesson
to be learned there.

Where you headed,
young Jay?

Why our parallel paths?

Why the intersecting sets?

this is where I get off.

<i>The two of us</i><i>
are standing</i>

<i>in the middle of</i><i>
the big brick plaza</i>

<i>that's in the center</i><i>
of campus</i>

<i>that everybody calls</i><i>
"The Plaza."</i>

<i>I'm pointing across the way</i><i>
to my dorm, Foucault Tower.</i>

<i>It's just about</i><i>
the biggest thing on campus.</i>

<i>It's part of the library,</i>

<i>a couple of</i><i>
student computer labs,</i>

<i>and a big dorm.</i>

<i>It's my second year there.</i>

<i>Dr. Boaz is standing on</i><i>
the bricks,</i>

<i>holding his Coke</i><i>
in his left hand</i>

<i>and looking like he's gonna</i><i>
twist off the cap</i>

<i>any second with his right.</i>

<i>He's just standing there,</i><i>
looking up at Foucault,</i>

<i>which is pronounced "Foo-COH,"</i><i>
not "Foo-CALT."</i>

<i>Which is what I called it</i><i>
for nearly a year</i>

<i>before my roommate, Walt,</i><i>
finally taught me</i><i>
the right way.</i>

Foucault Tower.

<i>He says it the right way.</i>

I remember when they built
this thing almost 20 years ago.

The wife and I had
a picnic lunch out here
in the plaza

every day for a week,

'cause that's how long
it took 'em to put it together.

Incredible feat of
architectural engineering,
isn't it?

Twenty-eight stories tall.

Houses 1.5 thousand students.

Yep, they built
the whole thing in sections.

One story units at this factory
in the Canadian Mid-West.

Pittsburgh steel,
North Carolina brick,

Texas HVAC system,
Massachusetts glass.

Imagine it, resting out there
on that permafrost.

Leviathan in sections.

Think of it, Jay.
See it in your mind.

They don't build a train
big enough to haul these things.

These 28 discreet quanta,
soon to become one.

So what's to do?

Air National Guard
Sikorsky skyhooks,
that's what.

Massive dual counter-rotational
rotor choppers,

four to a story.

112 of the biggest
damn helicopters

you'll ever see in your life.

Foucault Tower just
swept down here like
some storm front.

The kind that makes
meteorologists weep.

An architectural
Alberta clipper.

They just stacked them up, Jay.

Like the biggest damn
Lego blocks

you've ever seen
in your life.

-Like God's own Lego blocks!

[gunshots continue]




[siren blares in distance]


God?


Walt?


Wait, you can't go out there!
There's this guy--

[TV playing in background]




How's it going?

Oh, I'm doing all right.

There's somebody
shooting out there.

Yeah.

I know.

<i>So then I see Sally Richardson,</i><i>
this really cute girl</i>

<i>that sits in front of me</i><i>
in my Systems class,</i>

<i>which I guess we won't</i><i>
be having anymore.</i>

<i>Sally's a redhead with</i><i>
real pretty blue eyes.</i>

<i>She's got a nice voice, too.</i><i>
She sings in the choir.</i>

<i>She's the third girl in</i><i>
from the right,</i>

<i>on the second row up from</i><i>
the bottom</i>

<i>when they get</i><i>
everybody on the risers.</i>

<i>Sometimes I work the call</i><i>
and she talks to me</i><i>
on her way out.</i>

<i>She's real nice.</i><i>
She always waves "hi" to me.</i>

<i>That could mean</i><i>
she likes me.</i>

<i>Or it could mean</i><i>
she's just acting nice.</i>

<i>Typically, Walt's</i><i>
the guy I'd straighten</i><i>
this stuff out with,</i>

<i>and I'm distracted</i><i>
'cause I'm trying to run</i>

<i>two Walt simulations</i><i>
in my head.</i>

<i>One is to get some advice</i><i>
on what to say to Sally,</i>

<i>and the other is to</i><i>
try and figure out</i>

<i>why Walt's up on the roof.</i>

<i>It's probably that there's</i><i>
some hurt people up there,</i>

<i>some people in danger there,</i><i>
and he's trying to help them</i>

<i>because he's this Eagle Scout</i><i>
and everything.</i>

<i>But he's been</i><i>
so spacey lately,</i>

<i>that I'm worried</i><i>
he's gonna ignore</i>

<i>his own safety</i><i>
or something.</i>

<i>So I need to get up there</i><i>
and help him get inside.</i>

<i>It figures this is when I get</i><i>
some prime Sally time.</i>

Jeez, you don't look so hot.

You've got Coke all over you.

I kinda got this... virus.

Oh, I'm sorry.
You gonna be okay?

Yeah.

Hey, I'd love to
take cover with you,

but I have to go up to the roof
and get my roommate off it

before he gets hurt.

Oh, jeez, I don't know.
Be careful.

Well, I'll see you
in Systems on Friday.

Yeah.


[distant sirens]

[banging on door]


I can't open the door!

[banging continues]

It's--

They did something to the door!

[banging continues]

I--

[banging continues]

You'd better just wait!
They--

[banging continues]

I have to--

I have to go.

<i>I step in and hit the button</i><i>
for the top.</i>

<i>The elevator always lurches</i><i>
and I feel like I'm getting</i>

<i>-bad goggle track in Cluster.</i>
-[elevator dings]

<i>But then it's really slow.</i>

<i>My pal, Phil,</i><i>
in Architecture,</i>

<i>says it's 'cause we</i><i>
bought the equipment</i>

<i>from the Russians as</i><i>
some sort of peace gesture.</i>

<i>I look down in the corner</i><i>
of the elevator and see</i>

<i>Rachel Porter,</i><i>
Sam's roommate,</i>

<i>kinda stuck in the corner</i><i>
of the floor.</i>

<i>She's wearing</i><i>
the bullfighter outfit.</i>

<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

<i>I don't wanna touch her</i><i>
the wrong way</i>

<i>and make her think I'm trying</i><i>
to put the moves on her.</i>

<i>I listen real close to check</i><i>
that she's still breathing,</i>

<i>because she isn't</i><i>
moving a whole bunch.</i>

Hey.
Hey, Rachel.

It's me, Jay.

Burn cycle.
Waking state.

<i>I guess the experiment</i><i>
sorta caught up with her.</i>

Emergent properties.
Acute paranoia.


You can't sleep
in the elevator.

You gotta go back to
your room, okay?

All right?

Hyp-- Hypnotic vision.

<i>She smells like</i><i>
clove cigarettes,</i>

<i>which always makes me imagine</i><i>
I'm in a Russian movie.</i>

<i>Which is strange because I've</i><i>
never seen a Russian movie.</i>

<i>But Rachel looks like she'd</i><i>
be good in one of those.</i>

<i>She'd need a bigger jacket,</i><i>
though,</i>

<i>because it's cold there.</i>

<i>Doesn't it sound like</i><i>
something in a Russian movie?</i>

<i>A girl falling asleep</i><i>
in an elevator?</i>

<i>I really wish</i><i>
I knew what to say.</i>

<i>I feel like I'm really</i><i>
blowing it here.</i>

[lighter flicking]

<i>She's drooling.</i><i>
Still cute, though.</i>

<i>She won't get up.</i>

<i>I pull the stop plunger</i><i>
and grab under her.</i>

-[bell ringing] <i>
-The bell starts ringing</i><i>
in the elevator.</i>

<i>It's about 50 feet</i><i>
to her suite.</i>

[bell ringing]

Fuck.

<i>I see Bobby.</i><i>
Bob's this Econ guy.</i>

<i>He's always wearing a tie.</i>

Localized psychosis.


What's wrong with Rachel?

Some psych major thing.

I'm taking her back
to her suite right now.

<i>I'm hoping Walt's smart enough</i><i>
to keep his head down,</i>

<i>'cause this won't take long.</i>

Collective memory loss.

She's kinda heavy.

Oh, man, that reminds me.
You know Jimmy, right?

Well, it doesn't matter.
Anyway...

his dad works
at Butterball Turkey.

[continues indistinctly]

[bell ringing]

[distant sirens]

[distant screaming]



Heard on the radio there's
some guy shooting people

out on the plaza.

I was just down there.

You all right?


I just got this virus,
you know?



-[thud]
-[distant screaming]

<i>We put Rachel</i><i>
inside the door</i>

<i>and stick</i><i>
a Post-It note on her,</i>

<i>telling her suite-mates</i><i>
to put her to bed.</i>

<i>I jog back to the elevator</i><i>
and hop back in.</i>

<i>Bob's still talking</i><i>
about the radio.</i>

<i>Then he starts to tell me that</i><i>
I should stay here</i>

<i>with the shooting</i><i>
and everything.</i>

<i>I push the stop plunger and</i><i>
the car starts moving again.</i>

[bell stops ringing]


[cart clattering]


[loud metallic clanging]

<i>You can't get off on</i><i>
the 19th floor.</i>

<i>They sealed it off</i><i>
about seven years ago</i>

<i>and nobody knows why.</i>

<i>Gene down at the theater</i><i>
says that</i>

<i>the campus cops have got <i>
some kind of computer in there,</i></i>

<i>-and they use it to</i><i>
keep track of everybody.</i>
-[electronic buzzing]

<i>He says that they even</i><i>
keep track of</i>

<i>what you get at the snack bar</i><i>
and the cafeteria</i>

<i>because about seven years ago</i>

<i>is when they started</i><i>
using magnetic IDs.</i>

<i>He says they dump</i><i>
all that stuff into</i>

<i>the main</i><i>
NSC database in D.C.</i>

<i>Gene says that they can tell</i><i>
from what you eat</i>

<i>what sort of</i><i>
political stuff you think.</i>

<i>Keeps talking about how</i>

<i>they're gonna arrest</i><i>
all the vegetarians.</i>

<i>So I'm always sure to eat <i>
at least a cheeseburger a week.</i></i>

<i>Gene's a smart guy.</i>

<i>He keeps track of everything</i><i>
he reads on these note cards,</i>

<i>which I figure is a good idea.</i>

<i>If I did that,</i><i>
I bet I'd get better grades.</i>

<i>Jamin swears that he saw</i><i>
a miniature helicopter</i>

<i>fly outta one of</i><i>
the windows once.</i>

<i>But that's gotta be</i><i>
bullshit</i>

<i>because the guys</i><i>
at the theater</i>

<i>are always trying to get me</i><i>
to fall for that stuff.</i>

<i>And he doesn't even live here.</i><i>
He lives over in Crowley.</i>

<i>And how would they get the gas</i><i>
for the helicopter up there,</i><i>
anyway?</i>

<i>-All I know is that when you</i><i>
pick up the phones in here...</i>
-[phone ringing]

<i>...sometimes you can hear</i><i>
what's going on</i><i>
in other folks' rooms,</i>

<i>just like it was the radio</i><i>
or something.</i>

<i>Once I picked up the room and</i><i>
heard this guy reading poetry.</i>

<i>Something about tornadoes</i><i>
and measuring oceans.</i>

<i>Walt once picked it up and</i><i>
heard this couple screwing.</i>

<i>Figures I get the poetry.</i>

<i>I gotta remember to get</i><i>
some of those 3x5 cards.</i>

<i>I write it on my hand</i><i>
with the felt tip I keep</i><i>
in my pocket.</i>

<i>I finally get to the study</i><i>
lounge on the top floor.</i>

<i>Most people don't use it</i><i>
anymore,</i>

<i>but it does have</i><i>
a really good view of</i>

<i>the experimental</i><i>
roof garden</i>

<i>on the top of</i><i>
the old botany building.</i>

<i>They planted this balanced</i><i>
ecosystem up there,</i>

<i>and you could go walk through</i><i>
it with your date</i>

<i>because it was</i><i>
really beautiful.</i>

<i>But then they had to</i><i>
close it down because</i><i>
they found out</i>

<i>the building had all this</i><i>
asbestos and fibers in it.</i>

<i>And then they ran out of money</i><i>
to clean it up,</i>

<i>but they did get money to build</i><i>
the new botany building,</i>

<i>so the old one's just</i><i>
sorta gone wild.</i>

<i>There was this kinda</i><i>
suicide fad</i>

<i>in the study lounge</i><i>
my freshman year.</i>

<i>There were a bunch of</i><i>
different people doing it.</i>

<i>The entire Philosophy and</i><i>
Self-Knowledge Club</i>

<i>just up and jumped off</i><i>
the balcony.</i>

<i>They just put down</i><i>
their books and pens...</i>

<i>Walked out to</i><i>
the observation deck</i><i>
and jumped off.</i>

<i>I guess they must've</i><i>
figured something out.</i>

<i>That's the main thing</i><i>
keeping me from</i>

<i>going into Philosophy</i><i>
right now.</i>

<i>People would want me to</i><i>
go to the club meetings,</i>

<i>and I'm not sure</i><i>
I wanna do that.</i>

<i>Then again, Rachel's in</i><i>
Philosophy and Self-Knowledge.</i>

[distant sirens blaring]

Walt!

-[Walt] Jay! That you?
-Yeah!

you didn't bring anybody
with you, did ya?

No! Should I have?

don't worry about it!
Just come on up!

Okay.

Give me a second.

[man on bullhorn] <i>
Walt!</i>

<i>Walt!</i>

<i>This is Dr. Haroldson.</i>

<i>You came by my office</i>

<i>and we talked about</i><i>
your problem.</i>

<i>Everyone disappearing, right?</i>

<i>I'm here to let you know</i><i>
that's not the way, all right?</i>

<i>There are better ways</i><i>
to go about this.</i>

[phone ringing]

you're an Eagle Scout.</i>

<i>I'm very impressed with that.</i>

<i>Anyone would be</i><i>
very impressed with that.</i>

<i>Your name, now.</i>

<i>Let that reverberate around</i>

<i>inside of that big,</i><i>
bright skull of yours.</i>

<i>Walt Whitman.</i>

-Hello!
-[man] <i>I'm on top of</i>

<i>Gimme a look up there.</i>

<i>-Gimme a look.</i>
-Okay.

<i>-That's good.</i>
-Yeah.

<i>-Get on it.</i>
-All right.

<i>Hey, that's good.</i>

<i>Hey, stand still</i><i>
just like I'm gonna take</i><i>
your picture, okay?</i>

<i>-Okay?</i>
-[gunshot]

-[Haroldson] <i>
You're an A student.</i>
-[Jay] Yes.

[gunshots ricochet]


You gotta keep
your fucking head down.

Walt always was fast.</i>

<i>He's killer</i><i>
at ultimate Frisbee.</i>

<i>He's one of those guys</i><i>
that can do everything.</i>

<i>Write A papers,</i><i>
play chess,</i>

<i>talk to girls and get 'em</i><i>
to laugh at his jokes.</i>

<i>Repair cars,</i><i>
shoot foul shots, fix radios,</i>

<i>score free steaks from</i><i>
the dining hall</i>

<i>by doing this trick</i><i>
with his meal card.</i>

<i>He's the only guy on the floor</i>

<i>that can get the radiators</i><i>
to work when it's cold.</i>

<i>He can talk his professors</i><i>
into giving extensions,</i>

<i>flip a stack of ten quarters</i><i>
off his elbow and catch them</i>

<i>all with the same hand</i><i>
before they hit the floor,</i>

<i>and he knows what ties</i><i>
go with which shirts.</i>

<i>Apparently, he's pretty good</i><i>
at helping people</i><i>
dodge bullets, too.</i>

<i>He's a great guy.</i>

<i>He loaned me five bucks</i><i>
to do my laundry</i>

<i>-and never asked for it back.</i>
-[Walt] Come on, come on!

<i>I need to remember</i><i>
to pay him back.</i>

Wow!
Walt, you saved my life!

That nut almost got me.

Well, Jay.
That's actually the police

trying to get me out
from under cover.

And it's pretty creative work,
actually.

I'm impressed.

Walt, why are you wearing
all this Army stuff?

The cops are gonna think
you're the guy

if you're dressed like that.

Well, police must've thought
that you were me, and...

it's pretty shoddy work when
you think about it, I mean,

it's not like they didn't have
all afternoon to pre-calibrate.

Do you want this, man?

Yeah, thanks.

Stupid campus cops.

Yeah, come on.
Set up over here.

<i>So Walt's got this</i><i>
campsite deal set up</i><i>
by the microwave.</i>

<i>There's a blanket,</i><i>
a little radio,</i>

<i>Walt's camping stove,</i><i>
a sleeping bag,</i>

<i>four cans of</i><i>
Lone Star Beef Stew,</i>

<i>a box of health food</i><i>
wheat crackers,</i>

<i>three Zeppelin-brand</i><i>
snack cakes,</i>

<i>five German chocolate bars</i><i>
from Europe,</i>

<i>a pack of mint Zephyr</i><i>
chewing gum,</i>

<i>a pair of binoculars,</i><i>
an umbrella,</i>

<i>couple of smoke bombs</i><i>
from the Army-Navy,</i>

<i>a big roll of firecrackers,</i><i>
and this rifle</i>

<i>with these yellow see-through</i><i>
boxes full of bullets.</i>

<i>Holy shit!</i>

<i>I've never seen hardly</i><i>
any of this stuff in my life.</i>

<i>He must've kept it all</i><i>
in that Boy Scout foot locker</i>

<i>he brought back from home</i><i>
a couple weeks ago.</i>

<i>Holy shit!</i>

Jay. Before you start and go
and get the wrong idea,

you know,
let me explain myself.

Jesus.

Walt...

You shot my fucking
Systems professor!

Sally was in there--

What do you mean,
"Don't get the wrong idea"?

-Fuck!
-Jay!

Okay. I'll listen.

<i>I figure,</i><i>
if he's talking to me,</i>

<i>at least he won't be</i><i>
shooting anybody.</i>

Now, uh...

you're not just saying that

because you don't want me
shooting anybody?

No, no!

No.

I mean...

Walt...

you're my roommate.
My-- My pal.

You're the best buddy
a guy could have.

I mean, hell,
you loaned me five bucks

and you never even
asked for it back.

I'm-- I'm worried about you.

You know,

I had completely forgotten
about that five bucks.

Don't sweat it.

Um...

Why do you have "3X5"
written on your hand?

You know, to get some of those
note cards, you know?

I thought it would help me
get organized.

Notes and stuff.

Yeah, I use those
for all my reports.

You know, I was using
so many of them, my, uh--

my granddad got me a case of
them down at the wholesale club

and they're under my bed.

So next time you're down
at the room, you know,

just get yourself a stack.

[Haroldson continues
indistinctly on bullhorn]


a great moment of weakness...</i>


<i>Whoa! Okay, Walt,</i><i>
you almost got me.</i>

<i>That was a good shot.</i>

-[gunshot]
-[bullhorn squeals]

[Haroldson groans]

Jeez.

Walt, those are
real people down there!

Jay...

you know, it's like...

Granddad says,

"A Whitman has got to do...

what a Whitman...

has got to do."

All right?
I'm gonna be right back.

<i>Walt's last name is Whitman.</i>

<i>Yeah, like the guy</i><i>
with the beard.</i>

<i>We had to watch this movie</i><i>
in freshman Composition</i>

<i>about how he would</i><i>
ride around on trollies</i>

<i>and try to pick up</i><i>
soldiers and stuff.</i>


[sirens blaring]

<i>Which, well...</i>

<i>I don't know</i><i>
what I think about that.</i>


[distant gunshot]

-[gunshot]
-[shell casing clatters]

-[gunshots]
-[grunting]

-[gunshot]
-[grunting]


Jeez, you know, I've got
one word for those guys,

and that's "windage."
Adjusted.


Hey, you want something?

I got uh--
I got uh, mints,

I got those, uh--
I got those Zeppelins here,

I got, uh...

I got some more gum, I got gum
down over there, huh?

How about uh...

you want uh...

some cupcakes, right?
You want a cupcake.

Okay, I got it.

Got some cupcakes for you.
Here you go.

[indistinct dialog]

-[snaps fingers]
-Hey, how about some radio?

[â™ª jazz music]

Cupcake, cupcake.
Right, right?

I'm trying to eat
all the things.

Cupcake?
There you go.

Walt, you don't smoke.

-[Walt] The way--
-[coughs]

The way I see it...

don't look a gift horse
in the mouth.

These were free.

I found them in the elevator.

You don't want one, do you?

-[radio announcer] <i>WLAW.</i>
-No thanks.

<i>West Campus' only</i><i>
AM oldies station.</i>

you shot those people.

They were all in the fade
anyway, brother.

Like bad 16mm movies
from the '70s.

You know, rented video
on the dash in July.


Jay, do you remember Susan?

Who?

Do you remember when
I asked you this question
three days ago?

What are you
talking about, Walt?

We got, uh...

We got Lone Star Beef Stew.
You want some?

No.

I'm still working on
my cupcake.

[thunder rumbling]

Jay, I know you're gonna have
a hard time believing this,

I mean, especially given
the circumstances and all,

but I'm talking
straight to you.

I'm speaking the truth.

I mean...

the important thing is,
have I ever lied to you?

No, but you've never taken an
elevator to the top of the roof

and started shooting people,
either.

I'm sorry.

That was kind of
a cheap shot, huh?

I--

Uh...

It's okay. It's okay,
don't worry about it.

It's like this.
I met...

Suze at West High.

We were both in band together,
and uh...

she played bass clarinet,

and I was just learning
to play bassoon.

And, uh, she--

she was just about
the cutest thing you ever saw,
I mean,

had this really nice
red hair, you know?

Wore it real long,
down her back, uh...

it was an auburn,
it wasn't that kinda
cheap-looking brassy-red.

And uh...

she had it in a bob, though,
through most of college,

which, I guess,
is when you would've known her.

Do you wanna see a picture?


Walt, I can't tell who this is.
What's wrong with this picture?

You... took that picture.

That happened to everything,
you know?

All her photos.

I used to keep all her, uh...

love letters to me in a--
in a big, old ammo box.

And uh, uh...

left it open one day--
One day!

Rain came in
through the window.

She wrote them all in that damn
pink felt pen of hers and...

they're all blurry now,
you know, like she...

cried on them
for eight hours straight.

I dated this girl for
three years in high school,
you know?

She was the first girl
I ever kissed, the first--

first girl I ever said
I love you to,
other than my mom.

Favorite drink was Diet Coke.

Anyway, she, uh--

she gets this big present,
from her grandparents, right?

This trip to New York.
And, uh...

she's real excited about it
'cause, uh,

you know,
she's an art student.

She's gonna go see
all the galleries and
studios and stuff.

And I was gonna go, too,
but, you know,

my dad,
he's kind of a tightwad,

and I-- I couldn't get
the money together, myself.

So I'm driving her
out to the airport,

and she turns to me like she's
real frightened and everything.

And she goes, "Oh, Gosh!
I left that overdue book
down in your room.

Can you take it
to the library for me?"

And I'm like,
"Sure, I'll take it."
And goes--

You know, she always gets so
preoccupied about that stuff

and I didn't want her
worrying about it while she
was in New York, and so...

I drop her off at the terminal,
and I wave goodbye to her

and a kiss goodbye and, uh...

I take her book back
to the library, right?

And I'm about to toss it
in the return bin

with all the other books,

and I think it might be a good
idea to, like, look through it,

you know, see if she left
any note cards in there
or anything.

And, uh, she had stuck
the printout slip from
the overdue department,

circulation department...

in there with it.

It's got her name on it.

Wanna see it?
See?

It's the only thing
left of her.

Was only supposed to be
gone one week.

Fucking overdue slip.

the speed and distance</i>

<i>of the furthest galaxies,</i>

<i>and the speed it's moving,</i><i>
the rate it's slowing down.</i>

<i>You can back-track it,</i><i>
like a movie.</i>

<i>Reverse the film.</i>

<i>And everything that's</i><i>
going away...</i>

<i>started somewhere.</i>

<i>So you take the speed</i><i>
and brought it back through</i><i>
Einstein equations.</i>

<i>You come back to a point,</i><i>
singularity we call it.</i>

<i>And he saw a past tense</i><i>
cataclysm strike this Earth.</i>

<i>Mountains moved,</i>

<i>destruction sweeps across</i><i>
the Earth.</i>

<i>And then the exact same phrase</i><i>
as Genesis 1:2.</i>

<i>"The Earth became</i><i>
a waste and a desolation."</i>

<i>What we see in</i><i>
Genesis 1:2 onward...</i>

[â™ª]

<i>...20 billion years ago.</i>

<i>186,000 miles a second.</i>

that old song,</i>

<i>"Happy, Happy Birthday,</i><i>
Baby."</i>

<i>The one where you figure</i><i>
the lady singing the song</i>

<i>is probably about</i><i>
the worst girlfriend</i>

<i>a guy could ever have.</i>

<i>Susan, Jesus, how many girls</i><i>
do I know named Susan?</i>

<i>Yell Susan into a crowded room</i><i>
and four people turn around.</i>

-[phone ringing] <i>
-I guess eight if you count</i><i>
their boyfriends.</i>

<i>The pay phone that got</i><i>
knocked off the wall</i><i>
starts ringing again,</i>

<i>and the hell if I'm</i><i>
gonna answer it this time.</i>

<i>I guess the wires</i><i>
are still hooked up.</i>

[phone ringing]

<i>Something about a girl.</i>

<i>A girl...</i>

<i>I feel like I'm taking</i><i>
a multiple choice test,</i>

<i>and I can't quite tell</i><i>
if the answer's true or false.</i>

<i>Perfume. Is that it?</i>

<i>Am I thinking about perfume?</i>

<i>Am I remembering something?</i>

<i>Susan...</i>

Fucking overdue slip.

I called her parents.

They didn't know what the hell
I was talking about.

Tried to hook up
with her roommate.

Figuring that, you know,
she'd know something and...

she didn't know who I wa--

I mean, she acted like
she'd never seen me before
in her life.

Uh, I'm--

I'm sorry, man, I--

I know I'm twisting your ear
pretty bad here.


yeah, 'cause I mean...

I gotta pull in a tangent here
for this to make any sense.

See, 'cause I'm a Whitman,
right?

I mean, we've got
a family history.

I mean,
we're real proud of it.

We're riflemen.


You know, rifleman,

sniper, sharpshooter,
marksman.

You know, hitter,
deadeye, crackerjack.

I'm the latest in a long
family line of snipers.

My granddaddy,

he's always talking about
our-- our genealogy

and all that stuff,
and, uh...

he says that my great, great,
great, great, great, great,

great, great, great grandfather,
Augustus Whitman, well,

he was such a crack shot,
I mean,

he was so legendary
all over,

that uh, he became--
his character became

the basis for
James Fenimore Cooper's
Natty Bumppo.

You know,
in the <i>Leatherstocking Tales,</i>

with <i>The Deerslayer,</i>
and <i>Last of the Mohicans.</i>

And, uh, my great, great,
great, great grandfather...

was always talking about him.

He was a sniper with
the Confederate Army.

He bagged four majors--
uh, four colonels,

three majors, like uh,
five captains,

like eight or nine lieutenants.
But his best shot,

the one my granddad was
always talking about,

was, you know, he's--
this guy's only like 17, right?

And he's up in
this big oak tree

and it's overlooking the
Shenandoah River down there.

And there's this--
there's this Union
Major General

and he's moving at
a dead gallop

right across
this big field, and boom!

Drops him right out of
the saddle, half a mile out.

Half a mile out!

And Granddad,
Granddad fought in the Pacific.

And he was always telling me
about how, you know,

he'd be zeroing in on--

on guys,
Japanese sentries, you know,

by the light of
their cigarettes.

And Dad, before he--

before he started
to sell insurance, well...

he was a sniper in Vietnam.

Forty-seven confirmed kills,
I mean,

that doesn't even count
the unconfirmed.

They're really stingy
about that.

I mean, you gotta
show proof. Proof!

I grew up with a rifle
in my hand, you know?

But my dad,
he wanted me to be different.

I mean, that's why they
named me Walt, right?

They figured a guy named
Walt Whitman,

he's not gonna
grow up to be a sniper.

Now, I was gonna go to college,
be a-- be a scholar.

But I still wanna be part of
the family heritage, right?


Yeah, I understand that,
I mean, my--

my dad wanted me to be
a TV repair man.

Right! So, I became
a history major and...

my plan was, I was gonna write
the book of our family,

and I was gonna call it, <i>
The Delicate Art of the Rifle.</i>

And it-- it was gonna
have everything.

It was gonna have pictures,
and-- and battle diagrams,

and interviews, and it was
gonna have all the journals

that my granddad had kept
from his granddad,

and that guy's granddad.

And you could go into
any library in this country

and you could take that book
off the shelf

and you could
read about the Whitmans.

It's not gonna happen now,
though.


'Cause I'm on the fade, too.

'Cause what Susan had...

it's catching, see?

I call her parents
the other day,

and it's disconnected.

I look 'em up
in the phone book.

Nothing, not a blank line,
not like it's been blacked out.

There's nothing there.
Directory assistance.

No listing!
I call her grandparents.

They say they're childless.
Never had kids.

I call her roommate.
She's gone.

I call her parents.
They're gone!

So I go over
to Housing Residence Life.

I mean, I've been over to
Student Health and finally--

I mean, Public Safety.

And I'm finally over there
and I say, "Look.

"I'm looking for a registered
student of this University.

Her name is
Susan N. Dutchman."

Couple of keystrokes later,
lady comes back to me,

and she says,
"Oh, yeah,

"we got her right here
in the database.

Susan N. Dutchman.
She's over in Foucault Tower,
room 1973B."

Foucault Tower, right?
Room 1973B, right?

I mean, you know and I know,

and everybody on this campus
with a brain and ears knows,

that nobody lives on
the 19th floor, man!

The only thing I had left
was this, right?

The only thing left for
Whitman on the fade, huh?

Had to make my mark,
make it real big,

'cause I'm not gonna be erased.

You know, it's a--
it's a virus, I mean,

it's communicable.
I mean, it's just like the flu.

I mean, you know how shit gets
around on a college campus.

It's a flu with
a metaphysical vector,

and a nice, long
latency period.

Better, uh--

Better listen in on my...

fifteen minutes of fame while
the getting's good, right?

Holy shit! What a shot!

Oh... Sorry.

[gunshot echoes]

Hey, hey, hey!

Hey...

Rough afternoon, right?
Rough afternoon.

Do you want a Coke, huh?
Coke?

Sure.

Yeah, here you go. Huh?

It's my second
free Coke of the day.

Yeah?

Yeah, I--

I didn't get to drink
the first one.

Well, that's no good.

[sirens blaring]

Jeez!

Armed-response tip number one,
you know,

when attempting stuff,
turn off the goddamn siren!

Uh...
[snaps fingers]

I gotta go, you know,
I gotta go work

the other side
of this building.

It's the old, uh,
one-two punch.

But I'm gonna be right back.
Hey, direct pressure on this.

Direct pressure, that's your
first step, slick, huh?

I'll be right back.

[sirens continue]

Sam?

You're really shiny.

Like an astronaut.

Sam...

can you--

can you get me outta here?

Beam me out or something?

Fucker!

Hey, hey, hey.
Jay?

Jay?

Speak to me, buddy.
Bud.

Look-a-chockie,
Look-a-chockie.

Look, look.
Wake up, wake up!

You have to do
one more thing for me.

Hey.
[snaps fingers]

One more thing for me, huh?

A little amateur photography.

This is my dad's old camera.
Vietnam.

He and his buddy,
a spotter.

See, snipers work in pairs,
right?

Well, his spotter
would use this camera

to help him out with
kill confirmation, right?

They were-- There were doing
all this shooting

and pictures weren't
coming out for shit

with this ordinary camera
they were using.

So they hooked up
with this techie,

who was in-country
out of Lawrence Livermore.

And they traded him
a V.C., uh--

handmade V.C. Tommy gun
for this camera here.

It uh-- It uses this film,
it's holographic.

Captures details,
you know, totalities.

So anyway, what a spotter does
is he scans the jungle,

or the desert or whatever,

with a pair of real
high-powered binoculars.

He's gotta look for movement.
He's gotta acquire the target.

When he's got it,
he goes to his sniper
and he says,

"Here's your elevation.
Here's your windage."

They take that shot,
you know?

That's when my dad's buddy,

he got into doing before
and after shots, you know,

-for kill confirmation.
-[man on bullhorn] <i>
Whitman...</i>

But then they moved up,
way up in the highlands, right?

Doing this crazy work
with... [indistinct]

And the pictures
just went to shit.

That's when they got
this camera.
