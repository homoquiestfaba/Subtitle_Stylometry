Welcome back to
rock talk with Mitch LeFon,

and it has come to my attention
that filmmaker Drew Fortier,

along with James L.
Edwards and Douglas Esper,

have been reported missing today.

Details are scarce at the moment,

but according to the authorities,

they were last seen two
days ago in Canton, Ohio,

where they were shooting a documentary

on the disappearance of the homeless.

The film is also being co-produced

by David Ellefson of Megadeth fame,

and Thom Hazaert of Ellefson Films.

Ellefson and Hazaert have declined

to comment on the situation

and I will keep you posted
as more details surface.

Mr Esper.

Mr Esper.

Mr Esper, I'm Inspector Dotani.

We're gonna be filming
our little sit down here,

and I'm gonna need your full attention,

'cause your story's all over the place

and we're gonna need to
get on the same page.

Mr Esper, your attention, please.

I already talked to the cops.

I don't know why I'm here.

Who are you?

We're not here to talk about me, okay?

We're here to talk about your story

and what you've gone through, okay?

Where's James and Drew?

All right, listen, Mr Esper,

you're facing some very
serious charges here, okay?

Until we can get to the bottom of this,

you're gonna be in a
whole world of trouble.

Watch the footage.
I've seen the footage, okay.

I want to hear this in
your own words, okay?

What did you see in the sewer?

I need a minute.

I need a minute, I.

Okay look, we don't have time for that.

What did you see in the sewers?

All right, tell you what,

let's just start from the beginning.

It looks like this was some
sort of documentary project

you guys threw together?

Yeah, it was, it was Drew's thing.

He got us all together.

I was just along for the ride.

All right.

Hey, this is Drew Fortier.

I'm on my way to a pre-production meeting

with David Ellefson and Thom Hazaert

out of Ellefson Films, to discuss our.

Take two.

Hey, this is Drew Fortier.

I'm on my way to a
pre-production meeting with.

Currently on my way, on the road,

to go meet up with David Ellefson

and Thom Hazaert of Ellefson Films

to discuss our upcoming film project.

And I figured I'd make a video diary

to capture the stuff behind the stuff,

which has always fascinated me,

hopefully it'll fascinate you as well.

Here at the hotel.

Thom.

Yeah.

Turn your fucking camera off.

This isn't a social call,
turn the fucking camera off.

Come in, sit.

Oh dude, I gotta run, man.
I'll hit you back, all right?

See ya, bye.

What's up, dude?
What are you doing here?

Where, where, oh where,
is our fucking movie, Drew?

I don't know.

We gave you this money months
and months and months ago.

I've been asking you for footage.

We haven't seen a second
of footage, not a second.

Do you have any?

Is anything done?

Well there's certain
elements I gotta prepare,

you know, and if it.

We're not making gone
with the fucking wind.

Take your camera, point it
at some homeless people, cut.

That's all you need to do.

I didn't know the stuff takes.

Listen, dude, here's the deal.

You are in breach of contract.

We gave you the money.

We were supposed to.

This thing was supposed to be done, okay?

Today's Friday.

Our tour's ending.

I want to see this by end
of day Sunday at the latest.

This is not gonna tarnish my reputation,

because if it tarnishes my reputation,

it's tarnishing yours.

What reputation?

You made the fucking "Ben Tango" movie.

What reputation are you gonna tarnish?

Well put.

Who's your crew?

Do you hire, have you hired anybody?

Where's our money? Did
you hire a fucking crew?

Have you done anything?

Oh yeah, James Edwards
and Douglas Esper.

Who's that?

That's your fucking crew.

Doug Esper and James?

We give you money to hire a real crew,

rent real equipment, and
make a fucking movie.

I have 15 fucking chimps with a Nikon

that could shoot this movie.

And if it's not done, they will.

We gotta go to sound check.

Let's get out of here.

Shit.

Fricking never ends, man.

No shit, always something.
Always something, isn't it?

Unreal.
Fuck.

Ah fuck.

Feel free to show yourself out.

God.

Oh fuck!

So now I gotta film a whole fucking movie

over one fucking weekend!

So I don't get fucking sued.

You wanted the shit behind the shit.

You wanted the stuff behind
the stuff? Well you fucking go!

Stupid fucking camera bullshit filmmaking,

cock sucking motherfucker,
yappa douche bag, piece of shit!

That's why they create medication.

This is why they create medication.

It's okay, it's all right, it's all right.

This is, it's okay, it's all right.

Everything's gonna be just fine.

You're gonna get such a
kick out of this, though.

This is gonna be good.

This is gonna be good.

Well the good news is I'm gonna
be early to James's house,

so that's good, right?

There we go.

It's real to get back on track with that

but he's not expecting me to
show up this fucking early!

Oh, hey.

Hey James, how you doing?

Drew.

Remember that conversation
we had about time management?

Yeah, back when I showed up late for,

late for everything all the time, sure.

Showing up four hours early
for a pre-production meeting

doesn't exactly make up for lost time.

All right, I give up.

What's with the camera?

Ah it's for behind the
scenes for the Ellefson thing.

It's no big deal.

So you're creating
more work for yourself.

Your ignorance has always been
outshined by your ambition.

Was that a compliment?

All right, let's cut the shit.

Why are you impending on my coffee time

and sweating all over my couch?

Okay I, you want the,

you want the short
story of the long story?

Short, damn it.

All right, Ellefson needs
us to start shooting ASAP.

What's the new start date?

This weekend, starting today.

Okay, now, now this, this really me off.

I figured this meeting
was gonna take an hour,

two at the max, okay?

Now instead, you show up four hours early,

you've canceled my weekend plans,

and now I have to go upstairs
and put pants on and work.

I know, I know, I know, James.

No, you don't know, Drew.

Ellefson wants to bonus us
out for the inconvenience.

How much?

500?

So what are we shooting today?

Well.

Who the hell is that?

Oh, it's Doug.

What is Doug doing at my house?

He's the third
member of the crew.

Dynamic.

Come on.

Doug, what
the hell are you doing?

Oh, hey.

James, what's up?

It's Drew.

It's Drew.

You guys are like twins, man.

I hope not.

What were you doing?

All right, have a seat.

Hey, James, what's happening?

Hey, Doug.

Have a seat, get comfy, take a load off.

Can I go in the kitchen
and make you a Hot Pocket?

Oh, that'd be perfect, man.

Thanks, what kind you got?

Doug, Doug, Doug, Doug.

Here, check this out.

Look, this is gonna be one
of your jobs for the weekend.

The weekend?

I thought this was like a one day thing.

Typical Drew, always
forgetting the important details,

but hitting you with the
last minute bullshit.

I really don't
have anything going on.

This is cool.

What exactly are we shooting today?

I figured we'd start with
like the homeless interviews

and just take it from there.

Gotcha.

I am so confused.

Oh, it's all gonna make sense.

You're gonna get such a
huge kick out of this.

No you're not.

Are you aware that
Drew has fraudulent past?

Drew's not a con.

Did you know anything about this project

prior to the shoot?

No.

Drew told me when and where to show up.

I showed up.

So no questions asked?

That's typical Drew.

It's always confusing at first,

but in the end it makes sense.

Really? Does to make a lot of sense

you're sitting in an
interrogation room right now?

Does he pay you?

Oh, come on, come on, come on.

So James, you
did put on pants, right?

Yes, I did.
Oh yeah, that's good.

I'm not thrilled
about it, but I did it.

Sacrificing for the art.

Indubitably.

All right, Doug, Doug.

So you're from the area,
and you're familiar

with the ridiculous homeless
population, I'm assuming.

It's out of control, man.

I mean, look around.

Every parking lot you go to,

two or three guys asking you for money.

It's an extra quarter to
go to the gas station.

Want to get groceries, it's
gonna cost you a dollar.

They're everywhere.

Well, they were everywhere.

Have you noticed being asked
by them less and less lately?

I guess not.

Well, that's exactly
what this is all about.

Huh?

Okay so, so the past few months

there's been this huge surge
of missing persons reports,

and it's all homeless people.

We're doing a documentary
on the homeless population.

Yeah, in a way.

But the hook is nobody gives a shit.

Press, local authorities.

You know, nobody cares.

But what we're doing is
building awareness, you know.

To see if we can find out

what the fuck happened to these people.

Starting with interviewing homeless people

who aren't missing.

That's pretty nice of us.

All right.

Looks like hobo heaven
over here. Look at this.

Wow.

I always see a ton of
homeless people over here, so.

Let's check it out.

You take me to all of
the best places, Drew.

I'm happy to be alive at this point.

Yeah.

All right, let's take a walk
around the train over here.

Here, why
don't I hold the camera?

Yeah, that works.

Remember to just leave it as is,

because your eyes are terrible,

to be perfectly blunt with you, all right?

All right, man.
Okay.

Geez.

I'm trying to help you out.

Drew.

Hey Doug, you
don't get to see anything.

I know, just give me the camera.

'Cause you actually don't
know how to focus for shit.

Yeah, there we go.

What the actual fuck?

Uh-huh.

We James, you're the producer.

So why don't you go
produce us an interview?

Excuse me, sir.

Hi, I'm sorry to bother you, but could we,

could we have a few words with you?

What's this about?

Oh, we're just doing a documentary

on the homeless population.

I was wondering if you might be able

to talk to us for a little bit.

Okay.

By any chance,

do either of you find gentlemen
happen to have a cigarette?

Yeah, yeah, I can do that.

Great.

That's a good brand.

I think we're done here.

Wait, wait.

Wait, wait, James,
James, before you leave,

will you be my lookout?

Will you be my lookout, James?

No, no, no, really, really.

James, do you know what it's like

to try to masturbate in
private when you're homeless?

Do you have any idea?

Can you just, five minutes.

You?

One of you?

Doug, I think
I got a job for ya.

Excuse me, miss.

Hi, we're,

we're harmless, we're harmless.

We were just hoping to ask
you a couple questions.

What?

Ah, ah.

She's afraid of
the eye thing over there.

That's just graffiti.

No, ah.
We gotta go back.

We'll get you
safely away from the eye,

and we'll, maybe we can
ask you a couple questions,

that has nothing to do
with the eye over there.

Come on, man.

Now the eye's starting to creep me out.

Doug.
I'm gonna cross my fingers,

and then, then I can.
You're good.

Then I can't, then
I can't, then I can't.

Come on over, come on over.

Okay, okay.

Just cross your, will you cross them?

Yup, fingers are
crossed, fingers are crossed.

Everybody got
their fingers crossed?

Yup.
All right.

Okay.
Let's go.

So how long have you been homeless?

Who wants to know?

Just us.

No, who wants to know?

Because if it's them,
then I'm not telling you,

but if it's you, that you
want to know, then sure.

I'll tell you, why not?

Sure, but only if it's
you that wants to know.

Who's them?

You know who them are.

Um, well yeah,
there's no them here.

It's this, this is me, James and Doug.

We're just, you know, just us.

You are them.

I'll only tell if you want to know.

For fuck's sake.

Well, this is turning into
a fucking mental health PSA.

We haven't even gotten
past the first question.

Yeah, maybe we should have

screened some of these people first.

This is good though.

It's real, it's raw. You
know, it's the, you know,

the real people of the streets.

This is what people need to see.

But, I'm sure we'll find

some more sane candidates eventually.

We just gotta keep on looking.

Hey James.
Yeah?

Got a cigarette?

Go fuck yourself.
Oh.

I'm not even supposed to be here today.

Oh, oh, oh, speaking about Jay, Doug.

Oh Christ.

So the first couple
of weeks I knew James,

I actually thought he was
the guy pink "Clerks."

Wait, he's not?

That's what I said.

You guys realize I have the car keys

and I can abandon you at any time, right?

All right, so by this point,

don't you think this whole thing

was a complete waste of time?

At first, yeah.

But the more we talked to the homeless,

they knew something.

They, they had seen something.

Okay, and these homeless people,

did they sign release forms?

No, not that I recall, no.

Uh-huh.

Where do you, where do you sleep?

Everywhere and anywhere.

I used to be a dweller, but I,

I realized that I was
better off above ground.

A dweller?

I was one for a while.

Could you
explain what a dweller is?

Well, there's a whole
population of us in the sewers.

Or, or was at least.

We all relocated underground and said,

fuck everything above ground.

Shit, we wanted to go missing.

About 40 or 50 of us down there.

A whole community scattered
all over the sewer system.

Almost like it's own little

self-sustaining world in the sewers.

Then our missing homeless,
started going missing.

Yeah, I remember hearing about them.

The stories that circulate
in the undergrounders.

The shining started happening,

I got the fuck back up here.

Lived every day trying to
forget what I heard and saw.

Which was?

The manifestation of everything
you never want to see it

in an almost pitch black tunnel.

I don't really talk about it.

It's just fucked up, man.

Just don't want to hear about it.

I don't know anything about it.

I don't know, I don't know.

I can tell you some shit

that'll make your skin crawl for a week.

Really?

I don't know, man.

Fuck, man.

Yeah, I've been hearing
some bad shit going down.

Just know that not too many people

make it out of the sewers and
there's a reason for that.

I had a buddy of mine, Jimmy,

he just disappeared.

I heard he went to someplace

where people were going underground.

Wherever there's like
remains of animals and.

Even people.

I just, that man, that's
kinda heavy shit right now.

It started with strange noises.

It sounded like a, it's
sounded like a baby crying.

People hear like, like dogs whimpering

or cats, or kids or something.

We kept hearing it echo

throughout the tunnels late at night.

And finally some of us
went to check it out

and didn't come back.

And we were all a little
spooked to say the least.

If you go underground,
bad stuff happens,

bad crap happens, they
just don't come back.

That's how I think what
happened to my friend, Jimmy.

Is it possible they just
relocated back above ground?

That's what we thought,

until we found the parts it didn't like.

It didn't like?

I saw it once.

It saw me, too.

I been hearing stuff
about weird kinda creatures.

You know that feeling you get

when someone or something is watching you?

Sure.

Well, I woke up one night
down there with that feeling.

I lit a match, and it was
about 10 feet away from me.

It had itself pressed up
against the tunnel wall,

like a fucking spider.

Yeah, it's like some creature.

Like some thing with long
fingers and fingernails.

Next thing I know, it
crawled over to me real close

and blew my match out.

Then all I could feel was being dragged

for fuck knows how long.

Then what happened?

I lived to tell the
tale, that's what happened.

Fortunately, I didn't go
missing like the rest,

but a big piece of me did.

We came through an
abandoned intersection tunnel.

Derek, Derek peaked in,

he said he could see something moving.

Then with as quick as it
takes a match to blow out,

all I could hear was Derek
gurgling in his own blood.

I got back in and nobody could believe me.

Where do you think they came from?

Hell man, I don't know.

I've been, like I said,

I've been in the military and,

I've been to places.

There's a lot of weird things that go on

that cannot be explained.

It just can't be explained,
and I can't explain it.

I shouldn't even be talking about it.

Shouldn't have talked about it.

Have you,

have you went to the
authorities about this?

Eh, the cops don't give a shit.

The fewer of us they have
to deal with, the better.

Yeah, those fucking assholes did nothing

and ended up throwing me

in a fucking psych ward for five days.

The cops have absolutely zero care

about the homeless at all.

Oh, they might take a report,

but it's just like I went
to the cops about Jimmy.

And I seem like, eh, well, you know.

Unless he's been gone for like, you know,

a couple of weeks or something like that,

there's really nothing
we could do about it.

So, it seems they just,
they just don't care.

I will tell you this, though.

They got real cagey when
I alluded to the fact

that I was attacked down in the sewer.

We're a dying breed.

Fucking cops, they're useless.

But I guess that's all
part of the plan, right?

Who's plan?

The government.

Some people coming
in and out any minute,

but we're at the local police station,

hopefully to capture
some on camera statements

about the missing homeless people.

Yeah, 'cause
we've had a lot of luck

winging it so far, sure.

I was talking to the camera,
James, but that's all right.

Yeah, so we'll just wait it
out and see what happens.

So far this has
been a waste of time, Drew.

We'll find somebody.

You know, I'm still gonna work
this guy, he looks important.

Excuse me, sir.

Would it be okay if we ask
you a couple questions?

You guys press?

No.

Podcasters, social media?

What's this for?

We're doing a documentary
on the missing homeless.

Oh, the disappearances.

All right, yeah, I'll answer
some questions on that.

What's your name, sir?

You can call me Jenkins.

Judging by
the way you're dressed,

Detective Jenkins?

Sure.

What can you tell
us about the recent surge

of disappearances within
the homeless population?

It's not really much different
than any other major city.

A lot of these homeless
like to squeeze into these

sort of hard to get out of spaces,

to try and get warm in the winter.

And they pass out drunk or strung out

and they freeze to death
when the temperature drops.

We find at least a few of them every year

when the weather breaks.

What about the,

what about the homeless
that relocated underground?

Well, there's not really
much to talk about there either

that you probably haven't already heard.

I mean the whole thing's been
blown way out of proportion.

Try me.

Some people moved underground.

It didn't work out.

I'm sure you've heard the rest.

I want to hear from you.

Why?

It's a dead end, man, trust me.

Yeah, but I'm just
trying to do my job, sir.

I'm just trying to get a
proper on camera statement

from the local authorities

in regards to the missing homeless people.

All right, look, guys, I'm really busy,

and it was really nice to me to sit down

and talk with you guys on
camera about this, but,

I really think we're done here.

What about the sightings?

What sightings?

We spoke to a
homeless man earlier.

He said he saw something in the sewer

that attacked and killed his friend.

What kind of something?

I don't know.

He said he was some kind of creature.

Okay, look, this is getting ridiculous.

How many homeless people
have you interviewed?

Maybe a dozen, per se.

Fair enough.

Out of that dozen, how
many of them would you say

weren't quite mentally there?

All of them.
Well not all of them.

I mean some seemed completely
coherent and level headed.

And that's exactly my point.

Seemed coherent and level-headed.

You guys gotta remember, these homeless,

they suffer from a multitude of illnesses.

Their grasp on reality isn't great.

Some of them can hold onto their faculties

better than others

and can even cough out a
convincing story when they need to.

And believe me, I know.

I've been doing this quite a long time.

So here's something for you to chew on.

John Doe.

Huh?
John Doe's.

There's you're missing homeless.

I don't get it.

Hospitals, morgues, jails.

We get John Doe's in there all the time.

Bottom line is, you're missing homeless

are either in the hospital,
in jail, or they're dead.

Let me ask you guys a question.

You guys have a film permit?

Fuck.

Are you kidding
me with this, Drew?

Good day, gentlemen.

What the fuck, man?

Hey, come on, Doug.

James, come on, man.

It's no big deal.

At least we didn't get in trouble.

Come on, buddy.

Are you still gonna give
me a ride to my car?

Did he say yeah?

How could you possibly
not have gotten a permit?

That is, that is without a doubt

the stupidest shit I've ever heard.

That is filmmaking 101.

It is the easiest shit.

Why is that fucking camera still on?

Dude, we've got to get the stuff

behind the stuff, man.

I guess that's a.
No, you don't.

Shut the fucking thing off.

Did it ever occur to you that maybe Drew

was just using you and James?

Doing whatever he could
to appease Ellefson.

I mean, all I know is that, you know,

Ellefson was producing,
Drew was directing.

I don't know why, they always got along.

Why would they have to appease?

Well, put another way.
Do you think he was maybe

just trying to do anything he could

to make it look like a documentary?

Because we talked to Ellefson earlier.

We also looked at the footage,

and basically his company fronted Drew

a large sum of money about six months ago.

And it looks like Drew did
absolutely nothing about it

until he was called out by Hazaert.

Drew is not a con, damn it.

All right, you know what?

Let me ask you this.

You did these interviews, this
whole thing hit a dead end.

Why keep going?

Well, I mean, we
talked to the detective.

He told us nothing was going on.

He said all the right things,
toed the company line.

None of us believed him.

This was before the permit thing.

Okay, saw that on the footage.

But what did you guys
talk about off camera?

James was pissed.

I mean, he stormed off.

I thought we were done, but
Drew found one last guy.

We interviewed him.

He knew how to get down in the sewers.

We rushed in without thinking
about the consequences.

Get in, get in.

Come on, get in, get in.
What?

Dude, we need this, man.

You need this.

I need this like I need a
fucking hole in the head.

Dude, calm down, man.

I'll get you more money, too.

How much?

Double.

What do you know so far?

Well.

Some homeless people

decided to relocate underground,

and then most have said
homeless people went missing.

I guess there's something
eating people down there, too.

But apparently there's nothing
going on down there at all.

What?

Those stories are shit.

How so?

Well for one, the undergrounders

are kind of like, elitist.

They don't want anybody fucking
up their paradise, you know?

So they make up these crazy stories

to keep people from going down there

and ruining their little party.

Oh, so they're still
down there and they do exist?

I could show you.

It's not far from here.

All right, here it is.

This is as far as I go, though.

You'll find your way in and
out of the sewers all right.

It's not difficult.

Good luck.

It's, I guess it's down here.

Drew.
Yeah?

Look, I'm willing to do this

because you're paying me extra and all,

but I need you to know
something, sincerely.

Say it.

I hope you get syphilis.

All right.

Poison ivy in my pants.

Oh, that's a spider web.

Find some bush.
Oh, there it is.

All right.

Let's go.

Make sure you put that light on.

Be worth to interest me.

It's gonna suck me right in.

It's here.

It's very charming.
Yeah, yeah, totally.

I can not believe

that you brought us out
to this fucking place.

I'm dead serious, man.

If I just have to get something
as far as a tetanus shot

after we're done here, you're
getting the bill for it.

Well, I pay
for everything else, so.

Ellefson has paid for everything else.

How far are we gonna take this?

As far as we need to go

till we find some kind
of substantial evidence

that people live down here.

And how do we find evidence
of getting out of here?

You know what, Doug?

You know how to make a map, right?

Just a pen and piece of paper.

You've got a piece of paper right there,

and just draw like lines

as to like where we make turns and shit.

So that that's your job right now.

This place is amazing.

Wait a second.

Shine a light over there.

What is that?

Wait, oh.

Asshole.
Douche bag.

Got my hopes up and
peed myself a little bit

at the same time.

Tell me a little bit, James and Drew.

Did they get along?

Yeah, there was a mutual
respect there, you know?

You gotta remember.

I mean, we got down in the sewers and,

we were exhausted and they,

they bickered.

It got pretty ugly.

Okay.

Did you know that Drew was paying James?

How's that make you feel?

That's about what I thought.

All right.

So here we are, in the sewer,

where the dwellers allegedly live.

And we're hoping to

find some kind of evidence

that they're actually still down here.

In an effort to capture everything,

we're gonna keep the cameras
rolling till we find something.

Which we will.

And.

Look at this.

You really think
people live down here?

Yeah.

Which way, which way should we go now?

All right, you want to flip a coin?

Let's go left.

All right.

So the way I see it, the way I see,

I never made much money
doing this stuff, you know?

And, you know who else

doesn't make much money
doing anything at all?

Doug, come check this out.

Homeless people.

So in that regard,

I feel a special
connection to these people.

Shut up, Drew.

I was 16 years old, had
a high school sweetheart,

and we actually reconnected
a couple of years ago

and she was a fat fucking pig.

Hey James, if you will.

Oh for fuck's
sake, are you kidding me?

No, it's okay.

We got more light batteries.

Hold on, hold on.

Don't have a fucking pissy fit.

Yeah I think.

Here, here's the bag, here's the bag.

What the?

Well put it the fuck in.

Hold on, hold on.

Just shut the fuck up, please, okay?

Okay, I got it.

Done.
Just five it to me.

For fuck's sake.

Okay, okay.

Come on, man.

Okay, see, better, light.
I swear to God,

the shit you get me into,
this is fucking absurd.

All right.

See, now I forgot what the
fuck I was gonna say, so.

You guys hear something?

Yeah, it's my patience wearing thin.

Listen.

Is that a cat?

Should we try and find it?

Why the would we do that?

The last thing we need is to catch rabies

from some creepy super pussy.

All right, Drew, aside
from a fucking cat meowing,

we haven't found shit.

So unless you've got a game plan,

why don't we just start heading back

so I don't spend the rest of my weekend

in a God damn sewer.

You know what the James,

I think you got a good point.

Doug, let's have the maps.

Oh yeah, yeah.

Thank you, buddy.
Sure.

James, hold the camera for a sec.

Drew, you
know you got black shit

all over your neck.

Oh, it's from the headphones.

That or maybe I got that in something.

Drew Fortier
Productions, the sound of quality.

Ellefson films.

Doug,

what the hell is this?

What?

Where's the top and where's the bottom?

I don't know.

I thought you said you
knew how to do this, right?

Are you fucking kidding?

Don't blame me, man.

I'm the go along to get along guy.

I'm not Pablo Picasso mapmaker here.

I just drew lines where we went.

I don't know.

You're probably not too
happy about this, James,

but all right.

It's all right, we'll,

not too far in where we
can't retrace our steps.

What, you leave
fucking breadcrumbs?

So do you feel responsible
you got everybody lost

because you couldn't make a simple map?

Look, I did the best
I could with what I had.

I don't know what they expected.

We were down in a tunnel.

We were lost.

I'm not a map maker.

I just.

How'd that make you feel?

I was, I was upset.

Mostly at myself, you know?

I wanted to come through for them.

This was my big opportunity
and I managed to fuck that up.

What are you doing?

Aw man.

I've always wanted to do that.

I figured that was good a time as any.

Oh, now's time where?
Yeah.

Now's the time?

We're down here lost.

It's been hours and we
don't know where we are.

And now's the time to
start joking around, huh?

I don't like confined spaces.

I don't even like the sound of my voice

and that's all I can hear.

Let's go.

Fuck.

All right, let's go this way.

All right assholes, hand it over.

Hand what over?

Everything.

The camera, the money, your
wallets and your phones.

This is what happens

when you listen to fucking Drew.

Shut the fuck up, or I'll
stick you, motherfucker.

The camera too, asshole.

Give me that.

Why are you
doing this? We paid you.

It doesn't fucking matter.

You gave me enough bullshit
to lead you in here

and give me enough to bullshit to feed you

to take what I need to take.

Good luck, assholes.

Would you
say you're angry at Drew then,

for the three of you getting mugged?

Yeah, I was fucking angry.

So Drew was fully responsible
for this whole situation.

You're God damn right
he was responsible!

Hey, calm down, Mr Esper, okay?

Drew tried to keep positive.

He wanted us to keep going.

And you know what?

At that point I had played
mister good soldier.

I had been happy go lucky
guy, but I was done, okay?

I was done, and his only response was,

hey, we'll figure it out.

We, we're good.

How are we good?

Do you have a history of anger problems?

Mm-hm.

I'm gonna get

a fucking fortune for this camera, shit.

Where the fuck am I?

Fuck.

Don't you even think you pussies can.

I have a knife, mother fuckers.

Don't thing I won't fuck
all three of you up.

Damn it.

Hey, the camera.

Why in the hell
would he leave the camera?

It's the only light.

Fuck.

At least we got something back.

Fuck.

By now, that fucking crack head

has probably run up God knows
what on my credit cards.

At least we got the camera
back. We got the light.

We know where the fuck
we're going now, right?

Come on, guys.

I'm covered in bat shit and mud.

I just want to go home.

Is that, is that too much to ask.

I just want to fucking go home.

Oh no, you can't even go home.

We gotta keep this fucking
thing going. The show has to,

we gotta keep the show going, okay, okay?

We're down here. We gotta,
shut the fuck up, please.

You just treat
this like a big fucking joke.

All right, so we're still in the sewers.

We got mugged, believe it or not.

We got followed by the
guy that led us down here.

But even though he did take the camera,

we ended up getting it back.

So, now we can see where we're going and,

yeah, we're gonna,

we're gonna keep on going.

Which probably sounds
redundant at this point.

Are you done?

So you think that Ellefson's

gonna actually reimburse us
for all the shit we lost?

Well, at this point, he fucking better.

Speaking of which, why
Ellefson of all people?

Why is he doing a documentary
on homeless people?

Honestly, he's, this whole documentary

is a way for him to get
the Wall Street Journal

to write a fluff piece about him.

What?

Camera, is that a security camera?

Now what the fuck

would a security camera
be doing down here?

It's getting
real fucking eerie, man.

Let's, let's keep going.
Okay.

Holy!

Oh my fucking God.

Oh mother fucker.

How the fuck
do you explain this?

Oh, come on.

Is that a fucking tooth?

Can we just admit how
up this is now, Drew?

Can we go?

Mother fuck.

Is that open?

Look, hold on, hold on a second.

You hear that?

Fuck dude.
It's getting closer.

Aw Jesus fucking Christ!

Fuck me.

Oh God.

Oh!

They're watching.

What?

The water.

We gotta get outta here!

What the fuck was that?

Fuck!
Fuck was that?

Fuck.

Aw fuck, again?

Where's the fucking batteries?

Shit.

Doug.

Doug.

Doug.
Doug!

I'm here guys, I'm here.

I'm here, I'm here.

Do you have the batteries?

You're worried about batteries?

We can't fucking see.

I don't know what it was,

but I got blood all over me.

Oh fuck!
Jesus Christ!

Seriously, what the
fuck is going on down there?

So was this the point where
you guys all got separated?

Why won't you answer my question?

Why won't you answer my question?

Look, we were lost.

We were exhausted.

I had to defend myself for
days against those things.

Don't you think you owe
me some information?

I don't know you a thing, Mr Esper.

Gonna ask you one more time.

Is this when you became
separated from Drew and James?

This is fucking bullshit, Dotani!

Fucking bullshit!

What am I even doing here?

Well, we're
getting your story straight.

It couldn't, the facts
couldn't be more straight.

All over the place.

All right, so,

believe in monsters?

Monsters?

Mr Esper, do you believe in monsters?

Everything they said was true.

We all saw it.

Worse, we heard it.

The dragging,

the scraping, the crying,

the meowing, growling.

I mean look, take your people
down there if you're so brave.

Go in those sewers
yourself, see what you find.

We've been in the sewers.
We do this day in and day out.

There's no damn monster down there.

Only in your imagination.

It's a sewer for God sakes.

You know what, you want answers?

Upload the footage from those
security cameras down there.

What security cameras?

There's no security cameras down there.

Yeah, there's a bunch of them.

We saw them.

We filmed one of them.

There are no security cameras
in the sewers, Mr Esper.

You've just had a
post-traumatic stress event.

Your memory's a little foggy,
but there are no cameras.

We're down there day in and day out,

and I can assure you that there
are no cameras down there.

No, no, you're wrong.

Incredible, absolutely incredible.

Can we start acknowledging

how fucking up this is right now?

Obviously people are
gonna start looking for us

if they haven't already.

But, they're not gonna know that we're,

they're not gonna know to
look in the fucking sewer.

If we find our way out of here,

how much do you figure
I'm gonna sue you for?

Oh, you still get,

you're really gonna sue me, James?

Well it's, on the plus side for you,

the likelihood of us making
it out of here is pretty slim.

So I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

Man, I guess everything's true.

Everything, everything those hobos said.

There's, something is down here.

There were sightings and,

it harmed people, it hurt
people, it killed people.

That, then that detective, you know,

obviously he's trying to hide something

because he tried to downplay everything.

Heck he had an explanation
for everything, too.

Look, at the end of
the day, we don't have shit.

We know that we've seen
some really fucked up shit,

but right now my only concern

is getting the fuck outta here.

All right, know what?

Whoa.
What?

You guys,

you guys hearing that?

What is that?

Oh shit, what is that?

What the?

Calm the fuck down, asshole.

You're in the same situation we are.

Are you a dweller?

Yeah, one of the first and
probably one of the last.

What the fuck
is going on down here?

They don't like the fucking light.

It's the only thing that keeps
them the fuck away from you.

Where the hell
did these things come from?

All I know is that a while back,

the EPA did their annual
probe of the sewers,

which usually scares the
shit out of all of us.

But this time it scared
the shit out of them.

That's when all these security cameras

started showing up in these tunnels.

I've been trying to get
out of here for weeks now.

And with my lights broken,

if I run into one of these
things down here, I'm fucked.

Well, let's try to wake
up tons of fun over here

and get the out of here.

Could you hold this for a second.

Doug, come on.

Get up.

Come on, we gotta go.

Hey man, you're good.

Oh no no no, he's.

Fuck!

Ripped his fucking head off!

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Where's Doug?

Oh, mother fucker.

This is completely fucked!

Mother fucker, Doug.

Oh God damn it, this is fucked!

Oh my God.

Doug, Doug, Doug.

We gotta find Doug, man.

Shut the fuck up.

For once in your miserable
fucking life, shut the fuck up.

No, no, shut up.

You are without a doubt the most amateur,

fucking pathetic filmmaker

I've ever worked for in
my entire fucking life.

It's because of you that I'm down here

and that Doug's down here.

And Doug's fucking gone.

He's fucking gone.

So keep in mind, if Doug's
dead, that's on you.

And if I fucking die, that's on you, too.

James, I, James, I'm so sorry, dude.

I didn't, really, I didn't
mean to get us into this, man.

Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up.

James.

Here's what we're gonna do.

They said to follow the water, right?

You heard him?
Yeah, yeah yeah.

Well Doug heard 'em, too.

So we follow the water and
hope that he does, too.

Okay.

All right, that sounds good.

I mean, one thing though, James.

What's that?

I don't, I don't hear any water.

Come on.

Doug.

Doug.

Doug.

You sound like you're trying to warn him

from beyond the grave.

I don't think that's gonna help.

Oh God.

How would the
fuck you explain that?

We're both seeing the
same thing here, right?

You know something, though?

What's that?

We've been getting everything on camera.

And most of the time,

when people go through
metaphysical experiences like this,

they don't even think to snap a picture,

and when they do, it's just blurry.

But we've been getting everything,

and it belongs to us.

It belongs to Ellefson Films.

I think they're better
off getting somebody else,

like they were gonna do.

What are you talking about?

It's nothing, man, really.

No, it's something.

I've known something was
up since you got here.

All right.

Remember when I showed up at
your house super early today?

Yeah, this
morning, several hours ago.

Yeah, how can I forget?

Well, I'd just come from a meeting

with Ellefson and Hazaert
a couple states away.

And they informed me

that because I hadn't fulfilled

my contractual obligation for the project,

that they were gonna take the money back,

get somebody else to do it.

Take me to court for breach of contract

and pretty much tarnish my
reputation in more words or less.

And so there's a lot on line here.

What the fuck man?

Well, at least they gave you the money

to get us to make the job right, right?

Not exactly.

What do you mean, not exactly?

Drew.

Okay.

They don't know I bonused you out.

That came out of my pocket.

You're the only person I know

that could have got this project done

as quick as it needed to be done.

And I, I didn't want to
show up empty handed.

God damn it, man.

If you had just come to
me and told me the truth,

I would've done it for free.

Seriously?

Yeah, fucktard.

Believe it or not, I'm not the
asshole that you think I am.

You're a good man, James.

You really are.

Oh, what is that?

Don't tell me.

Aw fuck.
Jesus, okay.

Again?
Okay, okay.

Hold on, hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold on.

Hold on, all right.

Where's your batteries?

I got 'em, I got 'em,
I got 'em.

Oh shit, James.
It's in front of us.

James, what do we do?

It's in
fucking front of us, man.

What do we do, James?

Get the battery out, now.

Quietly.

What the fuck are we gonna do?

It's, fuck, it's getting closer.

Get the fucking battery, man.

It was right in front of us, I heard it.

It's not here.

It must really not like the light.

We gotta move,
man. It's too fucking close.

All right.

Let's.

Come on.

Let's go, let's go.

Let's go this way.
Okay.

How can you possibly say
nothing's repeating itself,

when everything looks the same down here?

Everything!

Let's go this way.

Oh shit, James, daylight.

Drew, Drew, wait.

What is it?

Turn the light off,

turn the light off.
Okay.

Is it one of those things?
Yeah.

It's gonna see you.

No no no, it's okay,
it's about 20 feet up.

What do you see?

It's got itself pressed
up against the wall.

Sewer drain.

It's dressed like a hobo.

I think these things
used to be the dwellers.

Jesus Christ.

We need to, fuck.
They can't see me.

What is it doing?

Meowing like a cat.

Looks like it's meowing like a cat.

A cat?

Hey whoa, I think
there's a black cat down there.

Oh God.

What's it doing now?

It's luring someone in the sewer drain.

There's a girl.

Should we help her?

Drew.

We gotta, we don't have a choice.

We gotta keep on going.

There's nothing we can do.

This is fucked.

Oh, he's starting to, reaching her.

Come on.

I can't see this.

Come on.

There's nothing we could do.

There's nothing we could do.

How did you find your way out?

The girl said follow the water.

I stumbled around for hours.

I couldn't find a single
drop, but I could hear it.

It was right behind the wall.

So I followed the tunnel hours on end,

stumbling in the dark.

But then I started hearing those noises.

The dragging.

Like they were pulling
bodies down the tunnel.

The crying babies, the meowing, the.

That's when my light went out.

I saw a crack in the wall.

The noises got closer.

I ran, I jumped through the crack.

I fell into a strong current.

It carried me right
out to a reservoir and,

that's where the cops found me.

And how long was it

from the time you guys became separated

till the time you got out?

Several days, I think.

I mean, how long were we missing for?

All right, so you made it out safely.

Did you feel any remorse whatsoever

you left the other two behind?

I didn't leave them behind.

You could have gone back
to go find them, correct?

I didn't know if they were alive.

I didn't know if they were still in there.

I got out, I was exhausted.

I couldn't think straight.

And all of the sudden there's
cops with these bright lights

and they're asking me questions.

I didn't know what to do.

I didn't leave them behind.

Okay.

So really, this all points back at Drew.

He was responsible for this
whole situation, was he not?

Yes.

And you're angry at him?

You're damn right I am.

Okay.

Drew put me in that situation.

Yeah.

I trusted Drew.
Absolutely.

So taking this all in,

see how it sounds a little silly

you keep saying you saw some creature?

That's the thing, I did
see a creature down there.

Okay, but look, Mr Esper,
this is what happens.

We talked about the memory fog, okay?

You met all these homeless people.

They sold you on this fairy
tale of a creature, okay?

You got hit in the head.

So basically now your mind
has filled in the blanks.

You've convinced yourself
there's a creature.

No no no.

There's no creature.
Watch the footage!

I've seen the footage.
Watch the footage!

The fucking film.
We've seen the SD cards.

There is no creature.
No, no.

We were down there for hours.

Ask James and Drew, they'll
back up everything I said.

Ask James and Drew?
Yeah.

Okay, you know what?

Let's just get to the
bottom of this right now.

The whole reason we're having this talk.

We found the remains of Drew Fortier

and James Edwards about an hour ago.

Wait.

They're dead?

You're acting surprised.

You've known this entire
time that they're dead.

Admit it.
What the hell is going on?

I'll tell you what's going on.

You've said it multiple times.

You were angry at Drew.

He's been taking advantage of you.

He was paying the other guy.

You have a history of anger problems.

And eventually you got lost in a sewer.

You flipped out.

You killed him, James and
everybody else who was down there.

And now you're trying to sell
me some damn monster story.

Admit it!

Admit it, you killed them, Mr Esper.

I killed them?

Yes, you killed them.

Thank you for that.

I killed them?

Hey guys, we got our
confession. Come take him away.

I killed them?

Thank you, Mr Esper.

I killed them?

Yes.

I killed them?

Yes you did.

I killed them.

Yep, you did.

I killed them.

Thank you, Mr Esper.

I killed them.

Done.

I killed them.

Everything hasn't
been going according to plan,

obviously, but.

You all right?

I'm talking
to the fucking camera,

like I've been doing
all fucking day, James.

Okay, well I stopped filming.

What do you mean
you're not fucking shooting?

I mean, we're out of SD cards.

How long have
you been not shooting for?

I at.

Are you fucking
kidding me, James?

I don't know what to tell you.

Turn the camera on now.

I can't shoot
without an SD card.

Turn the fucking
camera on now, James!

We don't have an SD card.

You don't have any SD cards?

No problem, here.

I know Doug's missing and
that fucking sucks, okay?

All right, but this had to happen.

We're capturing some
incredible shit down here

and you should be proud to
be a part of this, okay?

All right.

I should be
proud to be a part of this?

Are you fucking kidding me.

No, I don't give a fuck,
James. You're here, I'm here.

We're in this together
right now, all right?

And when I say capture everything,

you capture fucking everything, okay?

Everything!

Incompetent fucking piece of shit.

You fucking lost it.

You fucking lost it.

All right.

I'm incompetent?

I'm, I'm not the one that
got us stuck down here,

you stupid ass.

James, I know, okay?

At least we got the fucking camera light

or else we'd be completely fucked.

All right.

We've been at this for like two days now.

We need to.

We're both tired.

Yeah, can't physically go out anymore.

Should we
start taking shifts or?

We got, we got two lights.

You know, if we can make that work.

We haven't been with in
a couple of hours, so.

All right, I.

Otherwise we're just gonna end up

passing out of fucking exhaustion.

I know we're exhausted, but,

we're sitting ducks here.

We won't be,
we won't be fucked with

'cause we know it doesn't look like light.

All right.

Just watch my ass, man.

This is, I don't know.

James?

Oh fuck.

Oh God!

What the fuck was that?

Oh James.

Oh fuck.

I am so sorry.

James, fucking James.

I'm all alone.

Come on, man.

Jesus.

This had to happen.

This had to happen.

I'm sorry to James and Doug's family,

but this had to happen.

I can see feel them
watching me all around me.

I can see one right now.

Doug?

Let's end this, come on.

I found a way out.

Oh my God.

Where you at?

Listen to the sound of
my voice, Drew, come on.

Doug?

I can hear your
footsteps, Drew, you're close.

Just keep coming towards me.

We got ya.

There's a light right here.

Little crack in the wall.

Come right through, we got you.

Come on, Drew, reach out.

Excellent work, investigator.

No problem.

The department will be
giving you full recognition.

I don't need any recognition.

Just doing my job, my man.

But I'll tell you what.

After this all, you gotta tell me now.

What is going on in the sewers?

That's why we needed you to
spin this around a little bit,

to get a confession.

See this whole thing,
if it waited any longer,

could have been a massive
nightmare coverup for the agency.

It's very political.

We don't need to go into that.

But, just know that the
situation in the sewers

has been entirely contained.

And because of your work here,

the media will be able
to twist this around

in a way that we need them to,

which is a tragic double homicide.

No one really needs to know what happened

down there in the sewers.

And, no one needs to see
that footage, either.

So we should probably turn that off.

You know what?

Yeah, let's go ahead and turn that off.
