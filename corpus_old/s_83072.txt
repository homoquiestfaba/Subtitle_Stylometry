Yes, I would like that very much indeed.

Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.

You could've said "fuck"

I was gonna fuck up on my first day.

Oh, piss it!

Right, I'll get my things
and then let's fix the country, shall we?

Yeah, I can't see why not.

It's all right.

Yes, I did.
I just went "blurh".

I didn't.

Why is that?

And I am primarily attractive to girls
who are cooler, game for a laugh.

So I should just go to America!

I'd get a girlfriend there instantly.

I think it's crap, Colin.

That's where you're wrong.

American girls would dig me

Lighting need to know when we're gonna
see the, erm, nipples and when we're not.

Yes, OK. Right.
At least it's nice and warm in here.

Yes, yeah.

Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

Some of her requests,

for instance, that I should bring
Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral,

I was confident she expected me to ignore.

But others she was pretty damn clear about.

When she first mentioned
what's about to happen,

I said, "Over my dead body."

And she said, "No, Daniel, over mine."

And as usual, my darling girl...

Absolutely.

Harry?
Sarah,

switch off your phone and tell me exactly
how long it is that you've been working here.

Two years, seven months,

three days and, I suppose, what, two hours?

And how long have you been in love
with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?

Um...

Two years, seven months, three days
and, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes.

Thought as much.

Do you think everybody knows?
Yes.

Do you think Karl knows?
Yes.

Oh, that is... that is bad news.

I just thought that maybe the time
had come to do something about it.

Like what?
Invite him out for a drink

then casually mention you'd like to marry
him and have lots of sex and babies.

You know that?
Yes.

And so does Karl.

It's Christmas.

Certainly. Excellent. Will do.

Thanks, boss.

Hi, Sarah.
Hi, Karl.

(" On radio: Christmas Is All Around)


Babe. Absolutely, fire away.

Mia, Mia, would you turn that down?

What is that?

That was the Christmas effort
from the once great Billy Mack.

Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen.

I can safely say that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

Oh, and coincidentally,
I believe Billy will be a guest

on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

Welcome back, Bill.

Billy, welcome back to the airwaves.

New Christmas single,
cover of Love Is All Around.

Except we've changed
the word "love" to "Christmas".

Yes, is that an important message
to you, Bill?


Christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives.

And that's not you?
That's not me, Michael.

When I was young and successful,
I was greedy and foolish

and now I'm left with no one,
wrinkled and alone.

Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.
For what?

For actually giving
a real answer to a question.

It doesn't often happen here
at Radio Watford, I can tell you.

Ask me anything, I'll tell you the truth.
Best shag you ever had?

Britney Spears.
Wow.

No, only kidding! (Snorts)

She was rubbish.
OK, here's one.

How do you think the new record
compares to your old, classic stuff?

Come on, Mikey, you know as well as I do
the record's crap.

(Bill laughing)

But wouldn't it be great
if number one this Christmas

wasn't some smug teenager

but an old ex-heroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price?

Those young popsters come Christmas
will be stretched out naked

with a cute bird balancing on their balls

and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat
with me manager Joe,

ugliest man in the world,

fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didn't pay off.

So if you believe in Father Christmas,
children, like your Uncle Billy does,

buy my festering turd of a record.

And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

of the moment we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line.

I think you're referring to

"If you really love Christmas..."

"Come on and let it snow." Ouch.

but I have decided...

not to. Not this time.

to our new prime minister?

Oh, I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married, though.

You know the type, he's married to his job.

Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

Excuse me, Judy, if you could
just lower the nipples

and cheat them a bit to the left?
OK.

it's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

No, Col! There are a few babes in America,
I grant you,

but they're going out
with rich, attractive guys.

that any bar anywhere in America

contains ten girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

than the whole of the United Kingdom.

Right, the Christmas party,
not my favourite night of the year

and your unhappy job to organise.

Tell me.
It's basic, really.

Find a venue, over-order on the drinks,
bulk buy the guacamole

and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

Wives and family and stuff?
Yeah. I mean, not children.

But their wives and girlfriends, et cetera.

Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible
six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend?

No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe,
hoping to be kissed.

Really?

Right.

He now spends all the time in his room.
I mean, he'll be up there now.

That's not unusual. My horrid son...
Bernard?

Bernard. Stays in his room all the time.
Thank goodness.

Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time.

I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong, you know?

I mean, clearly it's about his mum

but Christ, he might be injecting heroin
into his eyeballs for all I know.


Maybe just his veins.

The problem is his mum
always used to talk to him, you know, and...

I don't know, this whole stepfather thing
seems suddenly to somehow matter

like it never did before.

Listen, it was always going to be
a totally shit time.

Just be patient.

And maybe check the room for needles.

And then when he sometimes does
come out, it's obvious he's been crying.

It's just such a ridiculous waste.

And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

I just don't know.

Get a grip.

People hate sissies.

No one's ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

Yeah. Absolutely.

So, what's the problem, Samuel?

Is it just Mum or is it something else, huh?

Maybe school?

Are you being bullied?

Or is it something worse?

Can you give me any clues at all?

You really want to know?
I really want to know.

Even though you won't be able to help?

Even if that's the case, yeah.

OK. Well...

truth is, actually...

I'm in love.

Sorry?

I know I should be thinking
about Mum and I am but I'm in love.

I was before she died
and there's nothing I can do about it.

Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
No.

Ah, well. OK, well...

I'm a little relieved.

Why?
Because I...

thought it'd be something worse.

Worse than the total agony of being in love?

Er...

No, you're right.

Total agony.

Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth.
Oh.

So which exactly is the dodgy end?

At the end of the high street,
Harris Street, near the Queen's Head.

Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.
Hm.

Erm, and you live
with your husband? Boyfriend?

Three illegitimate but charming children?
No.

I've just split up with my boyfriend, so
I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.

Ah. Sorry.
No, it's fine.

I'm well shot of him.

with thighs the size of tree trunks.

I made a papier-mache lobster head.

What is this we're listening to?

Joni Mitchell.

I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.

I love her and true love lasts a lifetime.

Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught
your cold English wife how to feel.

Did she? Oh, well, that's good,
I must write to her and say thanks.

Which doll for Daisy's friend Emily?

The one that looks like a transvestite
or the one that looks like a dominatrix?

Yeah, erm,

Mary, can we move the Japanese
ambassador to four o'clock tomorrow?

Certainly, sir.
Terrific. Thanks so much.

Erm. Would you like the last, er...?


If you saw my sister, you'd understand why.

That's all right, more for me.

Just don't go eating it all yourself,

you're getting chubbier every day.

I'm very lucky I've got a constitution

Oop. Sorry.

Thank you.

Just stop. Stop.

I really must do copies.

There'd better not be eels in here.


Oh, what the hell is that?

Thank you. Thank you so much.

I know. I'll name

Or give me 50% of the profits.

Or I could give you 5% of the profits.


Romance?
Yes.

It's, erm...
(Imitates horror film sound effects)

Ah, er...




Er, scary? Yes, sometimes scary.

And, er, sometimes not.
Mainly scary how bad the writing is.

Mm.


Ah.

Sure.

It's my favourite time of day...

driving you.

Sorry.

later this morning, it's this guy... '

" Cos on Christmas...
'... the bad grandad of rock'n'roll,

'here at 10:30. Do not switch off.'

Banoffee pie?

No, thanks.

Thank God. You would've broken my heart
if you'd said yes.

Right, well, lucky you.

Can I come in?
Er, yeah, well, I'm a bit busy...

I was just passing and I thought
we might check that video thing out.

I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie

or maybe Munchies?

Actually, I was serious - I don't know
where it is. I'll have a look tonight.

Mark, can I say something?

Yeah.

I know you're Peter's best friend

and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

Look, don't, don't argue.

We've never got friendly.

But I wanted to say, I hope that can change.

I'm nice. I really am.
Apart from my terrible taste in pie and...

It would be great if we could be friends.

Absolutely. Absolutely.

Great.

Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video, though.

I had a real search when you first called
and couldn't find it so...

This one says
"Peter and Juliet's Wedding".

Do you think we might be on the right track?

Er, yeah, well... Wow. That-that could be it.

Do you mind if I...?
I've probably taped over it.

Almost everything's episodes of West Wing.

Oh.

Oh, bingo.

That's lovely.

Well done, you.

Oh, that's gorgeous.

Thank you so much, Mark,
this is exactly what I was hoping for.

I look quite pretty.

You've stayed rather close.

They're all of me.


Yes.

But...

you never talk to me.

You always talk to Peter.

You don't like me.

I hope it's useful.

Don't show it around too much.

Needs a bit of editing.

Look, I've got to get to a... lunch.

Early lunch.

You can just show yourself out, can't you?

It's a... self-preservation thing, you see.

Ah...

Need you to do a favour for me.
Of course.

Anything for the hero of the hour.

Don't ask me why,
and don't read stuff into this,

it's just a weird personality thing.

But, erm, you know Natalie who works here?

The chubby girl?

Ooh, would we call her chubby?

I think there's a pretty sizeable arse there,
yes, sir. Huge thighs.

Yeah. Well, whatever, erm...

I'm sure she's a lovely girl
but I wonder if you could, erm...

redistribute her?

It's done.

Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?

I got some terrible news today.

Let's have it.

Joanna's going back to America.
Your girl's American?

Yes, she's American.

And she's not my girl.

And she's going back to America.
That's the end of my life as I know it.

That is bad news.

Well, we need Kate

and we need Leo, and we need them now.

Come on.

'Hold on. Hold on.

'Keep your eyes closed.

'Do you trust me? '
'I trust you.'

Do you trust me?
I trust you.

Fool!
Get off, you big bully.

'AII right, open your eyes.'

You know, Sammy,
I'm sure she's unique and extraordinary

but general wisdom is that in the end,

there isn't just one person for each of us.

There was for Kate and Leo.

There was for you.

And there is for me.

She's the one.

Fair enough. And her name's Joanna?

Yeah, I know. Same as Mum.

(Knocking)
Yeah.

Thank you very much.

Oh. Appolo... Erm, appologia.

I have a plan.
Thank the Lord. Tell me.

Well, girls love musicians, don't they?
Uh-huh.

Even the weird ones get girlfriends.
That's right.

Meat Loaf definitely got laid at least once.

For God's sake,
Ringo Starr married a Bond girl.

Whatever. There's this big concert
at the end of term and Joanna's in it.

I thought if I was in the band
and played superbly,

she might fall in love with me.
What do you think?

I think it's brilliant, I think it's stellar.

Apart from the one obvious
tiny little baby little hiccup.

I don't play a musical instrument?
Yes, sir.

A tiny, insignificant detail.
