FEAST
with Peter Grey

Welcome to the 'Feast'
with Peter Grey.

In today's feast: srneæi steaks
Brulee cream and maple syrup.

These srneæe steaks from Sullivan County
I'm shot and tranèirao.

Gee, Peter! - What is it?
But it's Bambi!

Come on, Peg. I mean, hunting
basic human behavior!

We do already thousand years!
It is wretched!

This is... ecological,
i. ..

... sustainable.

If you want horror, and looks at a slaughterhouse
commercials every 5 minutes

and I'm sure you will not ever again
eating meat from a supermarket.

When we return
Feast continues...

... Cream Brulee with the resulting
of local maple syrup.

Do not leave.

Really no longer like this.
He uopæe not co-operating with me.

What was it the fuck?
What?

I was joking, moron!
Sally?

Tell him I said.
What can we say?

Peter, would you kill
you're playing a little.

No, tell him what I said.

It was hysterical.

No, I was joking.
The crowd followed me.

It was a fucking idiot!
Such was.

I can no longer work
with this asshole.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

Thank you.

What you èiniš
not called the 'work'!

Only from her that I miss
Site Meter is the ocarina!

Nice. That would help.

Bring a second, Phil.
There are dozens.

Such is no longer going.

Behold, Peter, you know what you signed,

I cook and take care Peg
for attention.

But she went too far,
All was turned joke, Phil.

This audience wants.

But that's not what I want!

It should be a show, I would
So teach your audience something!

They do not want something to learn, Peter!
They want to be entertained!

Sometimes you have to understand
But have you changed?

That's what I've been listening.
Viewership drops us, man!

I do not care for the audience!
Do not tell me about the audience!

Okay, okay.

You know what?

Rumors of the administration say thanks
your 'great concern' for ratings

unlikely to support
Peter Gray show from cancellation.

Hope you're not serious?

I'm dead serious.

Congratulations, sir 'inviolable'.

What the hell?

What happens? We have dinner,
Give little enthusiasm. Hop-hop!

What the hell is going on?
Where is everybody?

Another bad review,

Give public
what am I being asked.

I learned that 'le jus' means juice

so I can not say that the whole
experience was failure.

Because the food was one word -
povratluk.

'Povratluk', is this uopæe word?

Yeah.

How can you write such crap?

Just play my role, my heart.

And this role is?

Who?

If you violate the rules

Help!

Help!

I'm not sure whether we see anything in the middle,
but I feel we're close to it.

Do you like steak, Mr. Franks?
Look, what do you want?

Yes!

Well, you might be interested in that...

This steak comes from
local farms...

Without drugs or hormones.

The flavor is excellent.

How do you prefer?

Medium roasted.

No matter what you do not tell.

Plus, we have a barbecue.

Look at him, just as it should,
Medium hot.

What a nice refrigerator.

If you fail to do...

... Steak is yours.

Often I was in this forest,
Mr Franks...

Me and my big brother Johnny.

Johnny was somehow...
sometimes cruel kid

the guy who pulled the legs
rats in. ..

... and put in boxes
blind cat.

This is probably happening.

Radio is everything to me.
Evil, nasty things.

One day he went too far
with me.

Mojo is...

... how anger can izaæi
the little boy.

I dug his grave
bare hands.

He covered his body
leaves the country...

I did not even look for him.

Both my parents...

never knew whether their boy
alive or dead.

But in the end, many years later,
they died,

and with them the pain is resolved.

There are two kinds of people
in this svijeetu, Mr Franks.

One thing I added some
human experience...

And it is destroying...

... ambushed and shadows...

... waiting for someone next to me
to get me two.

Bockajuæi me with sticks...

... would not you begged for mercy.

These two kinds of people...

... and should be opposed.

Those who seek their reconciliation,
requires the destruction...

... Existence...

... and your steak is -
prepeèen!

(Why?)

What?

What, Mr. Franks?
I can not hear you.

If you want something to tell you,
then speak up!

Thus, Mr. Franks, you are right,
we are animals!

In particular I will reward you for this!

Listen, they say that all good things
one must come an end.

Despite the headaches,
show was really good.

GOOD!
GOOD, too good! Absolutely!

For Peter and Pegg,

standing side by side no one
more of them to comply.

Make a toast!

Good job!

What are you doing here?

The door was open.

You know, I used to be make-up.,
when I was a cop.

While I was in the service of police
worked on domestic violence.

Excuse me, sir...
Covley.

Can you help at all?

No need to be rude,
Mr Grey.

I'm sorry, I have arranged a meeting
in which I arrive.

Ma do?

And how I know you lost the restaurant
and then the show.

What does not kill me
makes me stronger.

Then you must be damn strong,
if you look.

What happened to you with your hand?

I was burned.

So, I dug a little...

A terrible tragedy
it with your brother.

Yes.

Have similarities with JT Franks.

Is it?

Yes, his son died,
two years ago.

Of leukemia.

Oh, this is a very sad story.

I knew not even to have a wife.
Yes, wonderful gentlemen.

Funny, she is convinced
that the Franks fled.

He did not want to be with her.

I do not believe it.

You see, I have supernatural
sense of smell.

Smell the crap far and wide.

How did you burned?
Kuhajuæi.

Kuhajuæi what?
Souffle.

Of what?
Sir.

Was he good?

Delicious.

OK. And you...

Watch out for that hand.

It looks serious.

Cheese souffle, Mr Grey!

Hello?

It's okay. It's okay.
I'll help you.

I'll help you.
You'll get away from here.

I have to solve these chains.
'll Be right back! I promise!
