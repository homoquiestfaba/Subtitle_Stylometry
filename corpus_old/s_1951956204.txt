<i>[Isocrate]</i> Hi to you all</font>

What's all this?

I'm just trying to make sense
of what's happening to me.

The way i figure,
i'm in a coma somewhere

Or on a very intense
drug trip.

Maybe i've traveled
through time,

Or perhaps i've, uh,
crash-landed on an alien planet,

And as we speak,

Extraterrestrials are trying
to harvest my intellect-

I mean, such as it is.

Maybe i'm the victim
of a mind experiment,

Or maybe i've died
and gone to heaven... or hell.

How about purgatory?
or maybe...

I've plain gone insane

'Cause i don't know
what's real anymore.

What's this supposed
to mean?

That represents
the unknown.

All things
i haven't thought of yet.

It's the one out of all these
that scares me the most.

Hey.
-This is for your own good.

If the lieutenant sees this,

You'll wish you could
go back in time.

I can't see her face-

Maya,
My girlfriend in 2008.

I spent all last night
trying to picture her smile.

I couldn't do it
no matter how hard i tried.

So maybe if i can
figure all this out...

Sam, no more
of this crazy talk.

I'm trying to be
a friend to you, but-

Okay, fair enough.

What i'm doing in 1973
and how to get back-

I'll figure it out
on my own.

But until then, i guess i'm left with
only one option. and what's that, Sam?

To spend my time here
doing what it is i do best.

Which is?

Catching bad guys.

<i>[Isocrate]</i> Hope you enjoy the show :) .

What's the big hurry, Trent?

We just want to talk to you
about an armed robbery.

You run like that,

We'll begin to think you're
guilty of something, huh?

Oops.

Please, help me! help!

What did you do that for?
for making me run.

It's all right. he's dressed
for a dip. i can't swim!

Isn't this a predicament? nah,
not really. Scum bums float.

Please! help!

All right. oh, come on. you can't
be serious. who are you working

The check cashing robberies
with, trent?

I don't know anything! you could
tell it to us, or you could tell it

To the little fishies
at the bottom of the lake.

Bye-bye.

Uh, i don't think
he's gonna come up, guys.

Can't let him drown.

All right.
get him out, Chris.

Oh, I can't swim.

Ray?

Nah, i took some lessons
when i was a kid.

They didn't stick.

Unbelievable. Chris?

Hooray!

Come on.

All right, just breath.
you'll be fine.

Just breath!

What's the hurry,
Mark Spitz?

Uhh!

Hey, get this guy
out of here.

I miss you, Maya.

You okay, Sam?

He looks like one of them
cartoon characters,

Got hit over the head
with a frying pan.

Don't he, loot? yeah, he
does! like in the funny papers.

Like in the funny papers.

Yeah,
like in the funny papers.

<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

<i>I was in an accident,
And wake up in 1973.</i>

<i>I don't know how or why
I'm here,</i>

<i>But whatever has happened,</i>

<i>It's like I've landed 
on a different planet.</i>

<i>Now if I can work out
the reason, I can get home.</i>

Last week, three triple "A" money
check cashing stores

Were robbed.

A little over $12,000
taken.

Oh, a tasty haul.

And best of luck to 'em,
whoever they are.

Three bodies were found,
one at each store-

Penny Driscoll.

Hey, looks like
she was cute...

Before she put on
the dead chick mask.

Alonzo de Souza
and Dennis Maguire.

All shot,
and that's no small thing

Considering they were tucked
snug behind bulletproof glass

With no witnesses,
no sign of forced entry.

Yeah, that's, uh,
that's very cool.

Hey, listen, any chance I'm
gonna get sprung anytime soon?

You know, "laugh-in"
is on tonight, and...

I got it bad
for that goldie hawn.

We know you're involved,
Trent.

No one loves hitting
check cashing stores

Like you
and your monkey squad.

So who were you meetin' at the
pool? i was meetin' my aunt Doris.

You know, you're just her type.
no, seriously.

I should give her your number.
you could be my uncle Gene.

Uncle Gene

Hey, that'd be perfect.

Why don't we practice?

Say it, you filthy scrote.
Aah!

You want me to stop?
Say it.

Aah! uncle! uncle!

uncle! uncle.

Not bad.

What is someone who can't swim
doing at lasker pool, Trent?

Well, it's never too late
to start.

Learning the backstroke
ain't a crime, is it?

We found this on you
when we pulled you in.

Could this be your cut
of the tiple "A" money jobs?

Or you just need a little
padding in your swim trunks?

Yeah, that ain't
my scrat.

If it was,
wouldn't it be wet?

You were saying?

What is it, June?

Assistant district attorney
crocker is here.

Fine. throw this pile of pus
back in the cage.

Oh, no, come on, man.
that cell smells like vomit.

Oh, i can help you
with that.

What was that?

That money isn't from
the check cashing robberies.

<i>Yeah, and Roe vs. Wade
ain't really two options</i>

When you find yourself
in a river.

What does that even mean?
That's an analogy.

Uh, no,
I don't think it is.

<i>It's like an analogy.</i>

Where i come from,
what you did is called

"Tampering
with physical evidence,"

And it's a class "E" felony. where
you come from? where is that, Hyde?

Where guns
are made of gingerbread,

And criminals confess
for lollipops.

Do you have any evidence
linking Trent to the robberies?

Well, well, well.
Aren't you the eager beaver?

<i>Now that was an analogy.</i>

No, that was just
obnoxious.

Ah, what's a guy gotta do to get
an analogy?

If we have the evidence,

We'd be able to charge him by now, right?
that's a lot of questions for a secretary.

There he is-

The golden retriever of
the district attorney's office.

Thank you, No-Nuts.

Lee, this is the transfer
from Hyde i told you about-

Sam Tyler.

Sam, this is Lee Crocker.

Not only does he know
where all the bodies are buried,

He knows the shovel sizes.

Welcome aboard, Tyler.

Like two peas in a pansy pod.

Detective,
If ignorance was a drug,

You'd be high all the time.

<i>Now that was an analogy.</i>

I took a look
at the file, Gene.

The F.C.C.
has a better case

Against George Carlin
and his seven dirty words

Than you have
against Kim Trent.

I agree.

We have no evidence
to secure a conviction.

Give us a second, Lee.

Detective Tyler and I
need a moment. Of course.

You want evidence?

Aladdin's cave.

What the hell is that?

There's 300 microdots
of L.S.D. here.

We plant 'em on Kim Trent

And watch him grow into
a big flower of justice.

That's just...

Great.

I detect sarcasm. How would you
do it where you come from?

We wouldn't have pulled him in
without evidence.

eEven if you knew there were people out there
in real danger? people are always in danger .

One minute, you're going about
your business. the next...

bang! you're taken out
by a speeding car.

Well, I'm taking a speeding car
off the road.

So what do you wanna do?

We give him
a desk appearance ticket,

We cut him loose,
but we stay on him.

We follow him,
see where he takes us,

Get some real evidence
so we can put him away for good.

That's your big plan?

Yeah, that's my big plan.

Fine.

Cut him loose.

But whatever happens next
is on your head.

You and Ray stay on Trent.

Anywhere he goes, you guys go. Got it? 
-sure thing.

We'll relieve you
in the morning.

Okay. i don't know if Ray's
gonna go for that plan. why not?

He doesn't really, uh-
He doesn't like me.

No.
No, i know.

No, the loot put him in
for a promotion to second grade,

And then you show up.

He-he just feels
like you took his spot.

But i wouldn't take it personal. just
Yeah, well,

I didn't request this transfer.
It just happened.

It's like Guantanamo bay
in here.

Oh, I wouldn't know.
i've never been to Puerto Rico.

Kim Trent, here is a D.A.T.
You are free to go.

You gotta respect those
who defend the constitution.

All hail
the Nixon administration.

Yeah, don't get too attached.

Are you okay, sir?
-Did you just see that?

Was it a rat? the rats
are big in this house, sir,

But they're harmless mostly.

I cleaned out that cell.

It smelled of vomit.

<i>He was right.
It did stink to high heaven.</i>

Well, I'm sure the, uh,

The next prisoner
will appreciate your efforts.

Tt's all love and light here
at the, uh, 1-2-5.

<i>Other news,
in honor of mother's day,</i>

<i>Elvis Presley will be
performing a special concert</i>

<i>In Lake Tahoe
at the Tahoe Sahara</i>

<i>In memory of his mother,
Gladys Presley-</i>

Whoa.

You must be 2B.
I'm Windy.

Windy.
Now that's an unusual name.

My fathenamed me Windy

Because he was a sailor and
wind was his gold. I'm Sam.

What?

Hey, wow! your fate line-
It's bisected!

Is that a good thing? It can
be. It's like a record skipping.

You're listening to one song,
the needle gets bumped,

And you're grooving
to a whole new tune.

What's up there? well, um,
there-for starters, no naked women.

Are you new to New York?
You could say that.

It's an adjustment.

I get homesick all the time
for Decorah, Iowa.

Lot of people,
a lot of love back there.

I know the feeling.
I used to spend hours

Just floating in an inner tube,  
looking up at the clouds.

You and me,
we stay in one place,

But the clouds go everywhere.
So sometimes I'd ask them

To carry a message
back to Decorah for me.

I imagine there's someone
floating in a lake,

Looking up at the same cloud,
sending me their love, too.

Hey, do you like to dance?
because i love to dance!

Not really.

Oh, great.
Well, then we'll have to dance.

Okay.

I'll see you around, 2B.

2-4-6 to central K,

We are approaching
Trent's apartment.

Where are Chris and Ray?

2-4-6 to central K.

Proceed, 2-4-6.

We're outside
Kim Trent's apartment.

Detectives Carling and Skelton
are not here.

Please raise car 1-3-5

And advise with their
location, K. 10-4, 2-4-6.

So is this how
you do things in Hyde?

You sit on your ass

And watch known criminals
pick their noses.

Actually, in Hyde,
we sit on our noses

And watch known criminals pick their
asses. All units, we have a report

Of a 10-22 disturbance
at triple "A" check cashing.

Let's go.

Still think it's Trent?
Actually...

Hey, police!

Take cover!

Enough.

I hit him.
good.

You okay?
uh, yeah, I think so.

June?

She's gonna be okay.

Pulse is normal.

All right. The bleeding's
stopped. Excuse me.

All right, let's get her.
Ready?

Okay.

She's gonna be okay.

Got the door? yeah, come
on. let's go. Lock it down.

All right.
All right, go ahead.

Where were you guys?

Loot, we got a radio message
to call into command.

Now I figured it was you

Shutting down Tyler's
brilliant surveillance scheme.

Took us three blocks south
to find a pay phone.

Found this radio
in June's car.

She must've
heard the call go out

And tried to be batgirl
or something.

And Junie always had dreams
of doing something important

At the department.

I told her, "you're a twirl, know your place." 
-So she didn't.

All right, I'm gonna canvass
the block, get some statements.

Somebody must've
had eyeballs on this.

This doesn't make any sense.

Trent took a huge risk.
He knew we'd be on to him.

There has to be a reason.

I want this mess cleaned up.

And I want you
to clear this away.

I don't want any of her
left lying on the street.

This is an active crime scene,
it still needs to be processed.

Clean it up!
I want you to clean it up now!

She works at the precinct.
She is family.

And I want to be able
to look her dad in the eye

And say you cleaned up

Every drop
of her precious blood.

Get off me! you can't
blame me, you lunatic!

This is Trent's fault!
He pulled the trigger!

You made sure there was a trigger
to pull! we had no evidence!

Tell that to June!

I give up. I give up!

I'm sick of this cosmic joke

That everyone
seems to be in on but me!

I'm sick of it.

Real.

Unreal.

Real.

Unreal.

Re-ow!

You know, this neighborhood
has gone to the dogs.

Mm-hmm, right.
That's, uh, an unusual ashtray.

Yeah. My granddaughter sofia
made it for me.

She loves to come over
and see all the butts in there.

<i>She says, "Nonna uses it."</i>

Beautiful story.

Should write a letter
to the surgeon general.

You know, if I squint,

There's a little bit
of that... Steve Mcqueen?

Um... look, you have
an unobstructed view

Of triple "A" money from here,

And judging from how much
you love your grandchild

And... your cigarettes,

I'm guessing you spend a lot
of time looking out that window.

Sure, I saw what happened,
but aside from the shooting,

There was nothing different
From any Tuesday or Thursday.

You guys showed up,
escorting the man who got shot.

"Us guys"?

Yeah, the police.

Policemen? in uniform?

Policemen in uniform.

you screwed up, you guys.

<i>Real big-time, huh, Stevie?</i>

I guess we did.

"Astronauts in orbit
to repair ailing skylab."

Hmm.

And those hippies think they
know how to get high, Junie.

Let's see what kind of trouble
dagwood's gettin' into today.

Been looking for you, boss.
How's she doing?

Same.

Uhh! oh!

Ah.
That felt good.

Yeah?

Then you're gonna
love this.

AAH!

I always liked June.

Truth be told, she'd probably
make a good cop.

I only know one way
to police.

So do I.

I'm not squeaky-clean,
and neither is this city.

I love this city.

It needs whoever it can get
to look after it. That's me.

You're gonna
ma this right.

Well...

I found a witness

Who saw two uniforms
escort Trent into the store.

That's how
they gained access.

Watch what you're saying, Tyler. 
-How can you...

The keeper
of Aladdin's cave...

Question the existence of dirty cops

Just because, you know,
you don't like it?

I'm not turing the spotlight
on my own department.

No, you're just gonna
coerce testimony

And set up suspects
just to close the case.

Oh, you got somethin'
on your mouth there.

Let me-let me see.

Ah! what are you doin'?
hey, stop that! get off me!

<i>Don't do-don't do that.
I'll do that.</i>

Hey!

Spaceman!

Heard the boss gave you
a ride to pummel city.

I need to talk with you,
Ray,

About your moonlighting.

Talk to me.

Ain't like I'm the only one
moonlighting at the 1-2-5.

Your named turned up

On a list of cops
who work security for triple "A" money.

Yeah.

I make $300 and change a week
as a third grade detective.

That's barely enough
to afford

The clams arreganata
every friday night at guido's.

So I work a little security

When my money clip
runs a little light.

What's the calamity?

Well, Trent was
working with cops.

Cops were moonlighting
as security.

You have
firsthand knowledge.

You took a powder
on the stakeout, right?

So I'm coming to you.

You coming to me 'cause
you think i might be complicit?

It's the first I'm hearing
about cops being involved.

Well, Hunt isn't with me
on this,

But, uh, i got an eyewitness
that says so.

You should talk to Crocker.

The A.D.A.?
-If Hunt's stonewalling,

You're gonna need a friend
on the outside.

Why are you doing this for me,
going around hunt?

Hunt was my hook
to second grade.

For three years,
I carried his water.

Lot of good that did me
when you showed up.

Crocker's a little too
bucking-for-sainthood

For my liking,
but he's a straight shooter.

He'll know what to do.
Give him a try.

And you think cops
from the 1-2-5 are involved?

Well, I don't know.

Hunt's made it hard
to get any traction,

So that's why
I'm talking to you.

I'll have one of
my investigators look into it.

Should take
some of the pressure off.

I appreciate the help,
not to mention your discretion.

Of course.

Heck of a way to introduce
yourself to a new house.

You don't know
the half of it.

<i>Maya? Maya?</i>

<i>You in here?</i>

<i>Boo! </i>

<i>I'll remember that</i>

<i>Next time you want me to work
a uniform detail for you.</i>

<i>Who says "Boo"
in this day and age?</i>

<i>You're like
a cartoon character</i>

<i>From the funny papers. Who says
"Funny papers"in this day and age?</i>

<i>Like in the funny papers.</i>

<i>Light some candels,
Run a bath.</i>

<i>I miss you , Maya.</i>

<i>No internet, no dvd,
no video games...</i>

<i>Oh, but I don't want to live
in a world without video games.</i>

<i>You're kinda
killing the mood.</i>

Hey, 2B!

Hey.
I whipped up a tray

Of "welcome to the second floor"
lasagna for you.

Well, that's,
Uh, very nice of you.

What's nice is
I'm about to introduce you

To the most luxurious lasagna
you've ever tasted.

Not to toot my own horn-
It's my mom's recipe-

But it's guaranteed
to cure what ails you.

That jerk you brought home
last night stole your watch?

Just have a slice
of mom's lasagna.

The war in Vietnam
got you down?

Just taste
that smooth ricotta cheese.

How you doing today?

Like some mom's lasagna
will hit the spot.

Hooray. It's a garden mix.

There's fresh tomatoes,
zucchini, carrots,

Peas, plenty of herbs,

And i add a healthy sprinkling
of Mary Jane's magic earth.

Mary Jane's magic earth?

No recipe is complete
without it.

There's Marijuana in here?

It's mellow,
nothing like the blue de hue

I had at my friend Randy's
pig roast. You know i'm a cop.

<i>Then you must get
the really good stuff.</i>

Um, there's something
I've been meaning to ask.

What you said the other day
about sending messages

Back to loved ones
through the clouds...

Yeah?

Well...

Do the clouds ever respond?

Nope.

It's just a one-way thing.
I never hear from the clouds.

But the stars-
they won't shut up.

My mom, my dad,
my brother Gregory,

My best friend Lolly-

They all send their love to me
through the stars.

Because the stars speak
for the lonely, blue hearts,

And lonely, blue hearts
tell the truth.

I gotta run.

Enjoy the las'.

And don't forget,
we still gotta dance.

As they say in New Orleans...

Bayou.

There he is, fellas.

Great.

Ahem.

There he is.

We should string him up
from the rafters

By his sneaky little rat-tail.

What's going on?

What's going on?
look at him play possum now.

Rats, possums... what did I
tell you about analogies, Ray?

The Loot just got off
the phone with Crocker.

Oh, yeah.

Wow.

Nice work, Tyler.
Yeah, way to go, buddy.

Unbelievable, huh?

Did you really think
it wouldn't get back to me?

Good luck.
Yeah, tell me about it.

Listen, bob,
did you get my e-mail?

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It's right here.

Real.

Unreal.

Real.

Print it out, would ya?

Unreal.

Sam, June's awake.

Are you okay?

They're not real.
What are you talking about?

The reason why I can't track
down the cops working with Trent

Isn't because
Hunt's been stonewalling.

It's because they don't exist.
Sam, you're not making any sense.

The cops from
the check cashing robberies-

They're impersonators.

Impersonators?

They're not real cops.

So the sawbones says

You're gonna be
right as rain in no time. Okay?

Yeah.

I'm still not clear
what happened.

What happened was I took care of
the guy that did this to you,

Shot him dead.

Who?

Kim Trent.

Did you know Kim Trent?

No. But you cleaned his cell of vomit.

Remember?

What were you doing
outside triple "A" money, June?

What's wrong with you?

June seems emotional.

Of course she's emotional.
she was shot.

That's not the kind of emotional
I'm talking about. Hey, hey!

Look at her.

Kim's dead?

Yeah, he died on the scene

From a gunshot wound
to the chest.

That's why you were there
with the police radio.

You weren't responding
to the call,

'Cause you were already there
as a lookout

And the getaway driver.

No. I just got the radio.

For Kim.

Yes. I mean no.

Kim loves me.

It took a while,
but we found each other.

We hadn't seen each other
since high school in Yonkers,

And then there he was,
outside of the precinct,

And he looked me up.
That's the kind of guy he was.

And you fed him information.
-Kim's gone, June.

It's time to start worrying
about yourself. I told Kim things-

Who was working,
where and when.

Eventually I was able
to pinch some uniforms

And some dupe shields.

No one noticed.
No one ever noticed.

Nobody noticed me except Kim.

And the radio message that
called off Chris and Ray-

That was you?

Yes.

I thought you always wanted
to join me on the bureau.

And be like you-

Taking the same crap,
day after day?

You're fooling yourself
if you ever think

They'll accept you
as one of them.

Junie, you know who
was fooling themselves?

This, um...

Listen to me.

I know what it feels like
to be alone.

It's like
someone's stolen away

The one thing in the world
you cared most about.

It happened
to me, too.

The universe
knocked me sideways

And took away everything

And everyone
I ever cared about.

You and me...

We have the same
lonely, blue heart, June.

Yeah.

I guess I do have
a lonely, blue heart.

Yeah.

Kim told me things. uh...

He was working with two guys,
uh...

Dax Benson
and Freddy Gerard.

Okay. Do you know
where we can find them?

I promised Kim
I wouldn't say anything.

June, June, I'm sorry,
but it wasn't real.

What you think you had
with Trent was not real.

You're protecting
the same man

Who put you
in this hospital bed.

He's killed four innocent
people. Do you understand?

It's time
to tell us everything.

'Cause lonely, blue hearts
tell the truth.

Get down!
Oolice! don't move!

You are surrounded
by armed bastards.

On the deck.

Dax Benson!
Hold it right there.

Put your feet on the ground.
Put your hands on your head.

You are under arrest.

Just in time, boys.

Drop it.
No, no, no, no! whoa!

Ohh!

I'm on the job!

I'm a cop! he's not!

I'm real! he's not!
Get off me!

Uhh!

Real cops don't run away.

Lieutenant Gene Hunt,

1-2-5.

What?

Kindly get off of my man.

Shut up.

Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Move.

This is why Trent's crew

Hit so many
Check cashing stores so quick.

They needed cash 'cause there
was a shipment on the way.

All right, you two,
Let's go.

Heroin...
Yahtzee!

And lots of it.

Move over.
Come on.

All right, step up.

You did good, Tyler.

But next time you start
having words with an A.D.A.,

You make damn sure
I know ahead of time.

See you tomorrow, boss.

We'll be out of here
in five.

Once again, you walk io
the space I was headed for.

You and I are not gonna
Get along, are we?

Nope.

Eventually,
I will burn you down,

And I will bag your ashes,
And I will bury your ashes

In the yard
where my big dog craps big crap.

Anyway, wow.

I asked you for help.

You made me out to be a rat.
It wasn't like that.

Gene has a way
of doing things.

I have a way
of dealing with him.

It's nothing personal.

Sam, he's right.

It's complicated
dealing with Hunt.

You of all people
should know that.

What's that?

Oh, um,

Well, Lee got us tickets
to see "Grease."

You know, it's been
playing for a year,

And I've been dying
to see it, so...

Summer lovin'.
Had me a blast.

I got a dinner to get to.

I'll see you later, Annie.

Sam.

You okay, Sam?

Yeah. Fine.

Sam?

You're a good cop, Sam.

There's less heroinon the street

'Cause you're
in the 1-2-5.

And that is very real.

Good night, Annie.

Good night, Sam.

<i>I miss you, too, baby.</i>
