THE WOMAN AND CULT MEMBERS: We have
been hiding among you for generations.

We are everywhere.

We bag your groceries,
we teach your children,

we fight your wars,

always beneath your notice,
always searching.

Tonight, we finally claim
what's rightfully ours,

power, unholy and unspeakable.

Power that had been hidden
from us

beneath a house of lies,

power to remake this weak world
in our image,

power to cheat death
and live forever in darkness.

We are the divide.

We carry on.

JOSIE: Feels like I'm
back in high school

with you driving me around.

JOSIE'S MOM: Josie,
I still drive you around everywhere.

JOSIE: No,
sometimes the Castillos pick me up.

JOSIE'S MOM: Just don't call
me five minutes after I leave

asking me to come back
and get you.

JOSIE:
That only happened twice.

JOSIE'S MOM: Because you
only went to a party twice.

Are you sure
I'm still goin' the right way?

JOSIE:
Yeah, this is right.

The house is
really high up here.

I love it.

JOSIE'S MOM:
Don't you ever get scared?

I know I'd be.

JOSIE:
Nah.

It's so hard to find this place,

I don't think it's even
on any map.

JOSIE'S MOM:
It's not on my GPS.

Is their daughter
in your Mustard Seed's troop?

JOSIE:
Not yet, next year.

JOSIE'S MOM: Oh, you're still going
to be a troop leader next year?

(Josie chuckles)

JOSIE:
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

JOSIE'S MOM: Honey, you're
surrounded by a bunch of 10-year-olds

when you're there.

(Josie chuckles)

JOSIE:
Thanks, mom.

JOSIE'S MOM: I don't mean to be
harsh, but I just...

JOSIE:
What?

JOSIE'S MOM: Weren't you invited
to some Christmas party tonight?

JOSIE:
Oh.

Yeah, I was, but...
(Josie sighs)

JOSIE: The Castillos
asked me to babysit, so.

JOSIE'S MOM: I thought all
your friends would be there.

Are you sure
I didn't miss the turn?

JOSIE:
No, it's up a little further.

And only Kate, but...

It's fine though, I... I'd
honestly rather be babysitting.

JOSIE'S MOM:
That's what I'm worried about.

JOSIE:
What do you mean?

JOSIE'S MOM:
Josie, I feel like you aren't...

I don't know,
making the most of your life.

JOSIE: You think
partying would fix that?

JOSIE'S MOM: No, but I just
wish you'd let yourself have fun

every once in a while.

And with people your own age.

JOSIE: I have fun when
I'm at Mustard Seeds.

It's... I just...
the house is up ahead.

Look, mom, I appreciate you
worrying about me,

but I'm fine.

I promise.

JOSIE'S MOM:
Okay, if you say so.

Well, keep me updated

on when you think the parents
will be home.

I hope it's not too late.

JOSIE:
It shouldn't be.

JOSIE'S MOM:
Love you, be safe.

JOSIE:
Always am.

I love you, too.

Bye.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

1, 2, 3, 4,

5, 6, 7,

8, 9, 10!

Ready or not, here I come!

Sophia.

Sophia!


Oh, Sophia!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Ha!

Shit.

â™ª Oh, what fun it is to ride â™ª

â™ª In a one-horse open sleigh â™ª

â™ª Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way â™ª

â™ª Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Ha!

Oh, dang it!


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Found you!


Jeez.


Hello?

KATE: (On phone)
<i>Josie, you comin' or what?</i>

<i>Everyone's here!</i>

Oh, um, no.

Uh, no, not tonight.

KATE: (On phone)
<i>Not tonight?</i>

<i>This is the Christmas party,
it only comes once a year.</i>

Uh, a babysitting gig came up.

KATE: (On phone)
<i>Babysitting?</i>

<i>Josie, Keith Calhoun has been
asking about you all night!</i>

<i>Get over here!</i>
I know, I know, but, um...

KATE: (On phone)
<i>But what?</i>

(Sighing)
I... I can't.

KATE: (On phone)
<i>Holy hell, Josie,</i>

<i>if only there was a camp badge
for getting laid.</i>

<i>You gotta grow up sometime.</i>

Hey, sorry, Kate, I gotta go.

KATE: (On phone) <i>You wanna spend
the rest of your life as a baby...</i>

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I don't know
where Sophia could be.

I mean I've searched
like every inch of this house

except for the one spot
where Sophia knows

that she's never allowed
to hide,

'cause it's so dangerous.

And I know that Sophia
would never break any rules,

she's a little angel.

Oh!
Aah!

You can't hide in there,
little monster,

you could have suffocated!
I know.

I tricked you, Josie.

(Grunts)
Alright, come on.


Come on,
let's get out of here.

Plus, it's not fair,
you were totally cheating.

And whoa-ho!

What are these?

My ninja swords for protection.

Well, you have me for that.

And besides,
if you hurt yourself with these,

then all our fun would be over.

Think I can hit the bull's-eye
from here?

No way.

Watch this.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Chuckling)
Oh.

Okay, just don't... don't
tell your parents about that.

SOPHIA:
Okay.

I'm the hide-and-seek king.

Huh, no one's better
at hide-and-seek than me.

Where is this pizza guy?

SOPHIA: Can we play
again after pizza, mom?

Mom?

I'm your friend Josie, silly.

One more time after pizza,
promise?

Alright.

Cross my heart and hope to die,
Mustard Seed's honor.

Pizza's here.


Oh, shoot,
I did not mean to scare you.

Wow, you guys are home
like super early.

The party was...
Not cool enough, apparently.


Hey, Mrs. Castillo.

You're not pizza.

Well,
you're not exactly pizza either.

Am I right, Jen?

Come here.

Mmm, muah.

How was she?
She was great.

We played hide-and-go-seek, we...

I almost suffocated.

Wha...

Oh, who's ready to rock out
with their cunt...

Patch!

Oh, shit, sorry.

What are we drinkin'?

Your options are coffee
or coffee.

Oh, hey.

Hey, Sadie.

It's been forever, right?

Like graduation?

Why haven't I seen you?

I've just been busy I guess.
I don't know.

I... I follow you
on Instagram though.

Josie Jane, you still doin'
the babysitter thing?

Um, just while I'm getting
my degree in teaching,

primary education.

PATCH:
Wait, you're in college?

I thought
you're like 16 or something.

Patch, we were friends
in high school.

Elementary school.

She knows I'm kidding.

You know, I'm kidding,
right, Josie?

I mean just 'cause she dresses
like a 12-year-old...

Patch, stop it!

JEN:
Two hours into the party

and the boys are suddenly seized
by some amazing idea

for a new track, so here we are.

Man, you guys are brutal.

And now, Sadie's gonna show me
her designs.

SADIE: Yes.
Oh, for your store?

You're... you're doing it?

Oh, yeah, doors open
in two months, girl.

SOPHIA:
â™ª Jingle bells, jingle bells â™ª

â™ª Jingle all the way â™ª

â™ª Oh, what fun it is to ride â™ª

â™ª In a one-horse open sleigh,
hey â™ª

Um, so are you guys done with me
for the night

or should I stay for anything?

Josie.

This is amazing.

Where did you get this?

Oh, um, yeah, I made it

with um,
just some of my old camp badges.

Camp Mustard Seed.

Oh, my gosh,
do you remember that place?

Well, yeah.

What dorks.

Ignore him.

My parents only made me go
the one year.

How many years
did you have to go?

Um, uh, pretty much
every summer,

for like 10 years,
and I'm a counselor there, so.

Oh, my gosh,
I'm obsessed with this.

Cardiology,
stealth and concealment,

ventriloquism?

You're a total badass.

Oh, my gosh, I have to make
one of these for my new store,

but with like
retro punk patches.

It's amazing.

Um, so should I call for a ride?

â™ª We wish you
a Merry Christmas â™ª

Whoa!

â™ª We wish you
a Merry Christmas â™ª

Whoa!

Okay.

It looks like
I'm not goin' anywhere, huh?

It's my turn to hide, right?

Okay, but where's the pizza?

Oh, it will be here soon,
I promise.

Start counting, okay?
Okay.

Hey, no cheating.

1, 1000.

2, 1000.

Thanks for staying.

Sure, anytime.

3, 1000.

4, 1000.

5, 1000.

Hmm, that's a good spot.

SOPHIA:
6, 1000.

(Doorbell dings)

SOPHIA:
Pizza's here!

â™ª Pizza's here for sure,
you gotta get that door â™ª

SOPHIA:
7, 1000.

RICK: Nobody can get that
door, really?

SOPHIA:
Dad, I'm busy.

â™ª So am I â™ª

SOPHIA:
8, 1000.

What's wrong with your Wi-Fi?

Oh, one thing at a time, ladies.

SOPHIA:
9, 1000.

Hold on.

And 10!

Oh!


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Sophia, run.

Patch!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Who are you?

What do you want?

Who, why, what?

This one thinks
she can demand answers.

Walk in there with the others,
and take her with you.

You disobey,
I hurt your child.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Patch grunting)
SADIE: Oh, my God.




No, no, no, no!


No!


What do you want?

Not you.

Sadie!

(Patch grunting)

I will kill you.

She's not on the list,
she doesn't matter.

You're not on the list,
you don't matter.


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Your friends are dead.

Because I've chosen,
as is my right,

to spare them
what is to come next.

We carry on.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

JEN:
Sophie, it's gonna be okay.

I promise.
Liar!

You cannot promise her that.

Can you please just let us talk?

Silence!


(Rick grunting)

Stand down!

Stand down.

You could have ruined
everything.

We do things in order.


Take him.

(Taking deep breaths)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I have money.

I can get you whatever you want.


I severed your phone lines,
your alarms, your internet.

I've disabled
all your fancy cars.

(Rick grunting)

You're cut off!

(Taking deep breaths)

THE INTRUDER:
Adrift.

(Taking deep breaths)

Who are you?

What do you want?

We are what comes next.

We are not interested
in your money.

It means nothing to us.

You mean nothing to us.

Just a means to an end.

We carry on.

Understand this!

There's nothing you can do,
nothing you can say,

there are no words,
no prayers, pleads

that are gonna stop
what's about to unfold here,

Rick Castillo.

But you don't understand just
how much money I can get you.

No, wait, listen, I can pay...



(Rick taking deep breaths)

Listen, we have another
cell phone upstairs.

You can use that access
to all of our accounts ev...

Oh!
(Grunting)

There are some things
money can't buy.


THE INTRUDER:
Understand?

(Taking deep breaths)

Upstairs in the bedroom,
just get it.

You can...
Ow!

Do you still think we're after
your money, Big Rick?

Now, shut up,
nobody's goin' anywhere.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

You have a job to do.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Tell me, Rick,

how long have you lived
in this house?

About 10 years.

10 years, huh?

In those 10 years...

...you seen anything
that looks like this?

A box?

We have some jewelry boxes
and a safe.

This is why we mark our bodies,
reshape ourselves.

(Intruder takes a deep breath)

People like you are content

to live in the image
of their silent God!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

And just like Him,

you don't listen.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I didn't ask if you brought
something into this house.

I asked if you discovered it.

I'm... I'm sorry.

No, we never discovered
anything here.

(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

THE INTRUDER: You know who once
lived and died in these walls?

RICK: No, it...
it was uh, empty for years before us.

Decades probably.

Ever wonder why that is, Rick?


What the...

(Taking deep breaths)

What was that?

What?
That noise!

You're losing control
of the situation.

You would spill the blood
of the father...

There is somebody else
in this house.

(Taking deep breaths)

No, that's us.

We have begun.

There's no one else here

and you are wasting
precious time.

Why are you...

No more words.

Take them down, all of them.

You ain't over me.

(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Sophia, do you wanna know
a secret?

Open your eyes, Sophia.

Open your eyes now!

I'm the devil.

(Taking deep breaths)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


That's it?

Think about this house
and what it means.

Did this room call to you
or did you just start

with the first room
that you saw?

The box will call to you.

Are you listening?

Think blueprints,
think locations

that were marked in these walls.

Those locations are finite.

As finite as the true universe.

In a finite universe,
all mystery is extinct.

Listen.

Does the box call to you now?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Here?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Why are you stopping?

Yeah, she bit your hand,
and you almost killed her,

and now,
you wanna finish the job.

What is your name?

Boy.

Hmm, an old-school breed.

You listen to me, Boy.

It is never productive
to live outside the task.

That family downstairs,

they will all be destroyed
tonight.

We will feed them to this house.

That's why we need to find
the box.

What does it say in here?

We are what comes next.

This world is ours to destroy.

With the tools of man
and the blood of our enemy.

We are what comes next.

This world is ours to remake
for our own.

No law but our will.

No God but our desire.

We are what comes next.

We are the divide.

(Taking deep breaths)

But the f...

The only way
that family dies

is with their blood spilling
from the black masks.

That is the ritual,
that's how it works.

THE WOMAN:
This is our time.

So go find the box now
or this is all for nothing.


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(Doorbell rings)

THE INTRUDER: (On walkie-talkie)
<i>What's this?</i>

They were yelling
about a pizza guy before,

that's all this is.


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

No, stay hidden.

I'll get rid of him.

PIZZA GUY: Of course,
it's black, definitely and...

Well, the house?
No, it's older.

Oh, hey, call you back.

Ugh, so sorry.

I... I got lost tryin'
to find this place

all the way up here.

Tried to call
like a thousand times,

but I... I guess your phones
are out or somethin'.

Obviously, this is free.

Also, I got some coupons here
for you somewhere.

We don't need any.

No, no, no,
these are really good.

Hang on.

Hope I didn't leave 'em
in my ride.

These are like BOGO you know,
buy one, get one free.

(Grinder whirring)

Uh, everything okay in there?

Remodeling.

Ah!

A late-night remodeling.

(Clicks tongue)

Decent.

Decent.

Oh, ah, ha, found 'em!

Okay, again, so sorry.

Look, if uh, Mr. Lawrence Eddie
didn't find out about this,

I'd really...
Whoa, dude!

What is that?
(Chuckles)

Is that Rick Castillo?

Does he live here?

Oh man, shut up right now, uh...

This is like a life goal.

I'm... uh, I'm more than a fan.

I'm literally like a student
of his entire career.

Mr. Castillo is not at home,
it is late.

I'm sure you can understand
how he would like his privacy.

Oh, uh, yeah.
So sorry.

Uh, have a terrific night
and everything!

Dude, can you guess
where I'm standing right now?

Why would you assume

that means I'm standing
on top of something?

(Indistinct speech)

He's talking too much.

PIZZA GUY:
Just... just stop.

Okay, you're never gonna get it,
okay?

I'll just tell you.

I am currently
at Rick Castillo's front yard,

for real.

The biggest music producer
in the world lives here.

No, I didn't actually meet him.

...one-eyed lady.

Hey, can I call you back?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Oh.


Uh...

Oh, hey there, I was just...

Why are you still here?

Uh, what?
Answer the question.

Uh...

THE WOMAN: Why are you taking
pictures of this house?

Answer the question!

Look, I gotta...
I got some more pies to deliver.

Okay.

Okay, I just wanna say...

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)



Still adjusting.


(Chuckles)
(Taking deep breaths)

Not cool, lady.

Why did I have to sacrifice
my good eye?

Not cool.

Finish him.

Rick Castillo's my hero,
alright?

I'm sorry.


(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

You said
you were gonna handle it.

There's people that know
he's here.

I handled it.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)



(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(Taking deep breaths)

What's happening?

Who's shooting?

It was the pizza guy.

We have to hurry,
they're all outside,

and listen, I found the phone,
but it's dead.

Forget the phone,
take Sophia first.

Go out back and we can...
Right, I'll...

No.

No, wait,
we won't get past them,

they're all out front.
How many are up there?

JOSIE:
I think three.

They don't know that I'm here.

(Taking deep breaths)

RICK:
Hide, put the tape back.

There's definitely chargers
there upstairs.

Okay, I'll find something.

I promise I will help.

Don't leave.

JOSIE:
Okay.

Okay, Sophia, listen,
they can't know I was here,

okay?

I want you to put your hands
right behind your back

like you're still tied, okay?

Nothing will stop me
from coming back for you.

(Taking deep breaths)

I'll be back, I promise.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Taking deep breaths)

You were right, Boy.

We have mice.



Who are you?

I'm just the babysitter.

Did you get her?

Yeah, it's the damn babysitter.

Weren't you supposed
to have taken care

of the babysitter?

I thought
that was the babysitter.

Does that look
like a babysitter?

What does a babysitter
look like?

Like this!

Please.

(Taking deep breaths)


Stop.



What's the condition
of the mother?

She's still breathin'.

Cranial hemorrhaging.

She's definitely dying.

We need to get this done
before that happens.

Well, if it happens,
we have a backup.

(Taking deep breaths)

We carry on.

(Taking deep breaths)


Your babysitter blood
is a poor substitute

of the mother's.

(Taking deep breaths)

But I won't tell her
if you won't.

(Taking deep breaths)

You won't get away with this.


Did you...

Did you just say something
to me, little mouse?

I thought
I heard you say something.


No?

I didn't think so.

(Taking deep breaths)

Okay.

(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

We carry on.

This world is ours to destroy.

With the tools of man
and the blood of our enemy.

We are what comes next.

This world is ours to remake
as our own.

No law but our will.

No God but our desire!

We are the divide.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)



Josie.

(Taking deep breaths)

Oh, oh, oh, my gosh!

(Sadie coughing)

Are you dead?


So sorry.

I'm sorry.

About what?
About not being dead?

I was such a bitch to you
in high school.

What?
(Coughs)

You were just so uncool.

You still are,
but that was so shitty of me.


I mean we were best friends
in junior high.

Elementary.

(Taking deep breaths)

But it's okay, Sadie,
we just...

we just took different paths.

But hey, do you... do you think
that you can reach

that letter opener for me?

It's just...
it's right over there

on that table.

If you could just grab it
and put it in my hands

that'd be really nice
or um, cool.

Okay.


JOSIE:
Come on, Sadie, you can do this.

(Sadie coughing)

Come on, Sadie.

Come on, Sadie, please,
you can do this.

(Taking deep breaths)

JOSIE:
Come on, Sadie.

Oh, come on.

Please.



(Taking deep breaths)

Please, just put it in my hand.


(Taking deep breaths)

Oh, my gosh, Sadie.

Sadie?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I need you to drive this
into the woods

and leave it there.

Get back as fast as you can.

Anybody stops you,
anybody sees you.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Your mess is all cleaned up.

THE WOMAN: (On walkie-talkie)
<i>Stand guard.</i>

<i>No more interruptions.</i>

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Taking deep breaths)

(Intruder screaming)

If you were gonna hit me,

you would have already done it,
little girl.

(Taking deep breaths)

That's how I know
you're not gonna do it now.


(Taking deep breaths)


Put that down.

Stay back!

(Taking deep breaths)

Put that down.

Give me your hands.

Sit tight and shut up,

you might actually see
another sunrise.

(Taking deep breaths)

You're a lying sack of crap.

Maybe.

(Taking deep breaths)

First...

(Josie grunts)

THE INTRUDER: You're gonna
have a really long night.

I'm gonna make a woman
out of you.




You think you can take me, huh?


Oh, think you could do me
some damage?

I'll... I'll stop you.

No!

What happens after you hit me
with that, huh?

What do you think?

One tap.

That's it, lights out,
end of my story?

To get at me with that

you're gonna have
to hit me again,

and again, and again,
and again, and again!

Till my head is a bloody pulp!

You think you're made for that?

(Taking deep breaths)

Because if my head's
not a bloody pulp,

I'm gonna keep gettin' up

and I'd keep comin' for you
with this!

That's the difference
between us.

I will.

I will stop you.

(Josie taking deep breaths)


Look at you.


You're a spoiled child.

When I was a child
I was raised to hurt people.

I liked hurting people.

I still like hurting people.

You understand?

I bet you've never hurt anybody
in your whole life.

I'm willing to bet my blood
on it.


JOSIE:
God.

You can't do nothin',
because you ain't nothin'.

This was always gonna
happen here, babysitter.


Now, give me your hands!


You're right.

(Taking deep breaths)

My whole life
I've never hurt anybody.

Not even to defend myself.

Not even a little.


Not even once.

(Taking deep breaths)

But I am ready to try.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)





You're a weak little girl,
just like the rest.



(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Taking deep breaths)

Never underestimate
a Mustard Seed.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Your parents need a timeout.

But you and me, Sophia,
we're gonna stay up all night

and greet the new world.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

JEN:
No!

No!

No!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(Taking deep breaths)

Harder they fall.

(Taking deep breaths)

Sophia, you ever lay awake
at night,

because you're scared
of the big bad monster

under the bed?

Wanna see what lives
under the monster's bed?

Get away from her,
you psycho.


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(Taking deep breaths)

What happened to the other one?

Did you betray him, too?

Babysitter.

She's here.


Where are you going?

â™ª We hike, and we camp,
and we do good deeds â™ª

â™ª This is the song
of the Mustard Seeds â™ª

â™ª We hike, and we camp,
and we do good deeds â™ª

â™ª This is the song
of the Mustard Seeds â™ª

(Taking deep breaths)


Josie?


THE WOMAN:
Josie.

You lose somethin',
little mouse?

Looks like your mom's
worried about you.

How do you think she'd feel
if she found out

that her little mouse is dead?

(Taking deep breaths)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I am not gonna chase you,
babysitter,

because I don't have to.

You got nowhere to run,
nowhere to hide.

You don't matter.

I order you to come down
here now.

If you're not in front of me
in three seconds,

I will go down below
and I will destroy that family.

And it'll be all your fault.

So little mouse, get...
No, you won't.

'Cause I've got your box.

You give it to me

or I will kill
that entire family!

But you can't, right?

'Cause I've got
your stupid masks.


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

What are you doin' out
of your chair?

Brave girl.

Bad things happen down there.

Little mouse!

I have the girl here with me.

Understand this, little mouse,
you are nothing but alone.

Your police,
they're not coming for you.

Your mommy
is not coming for you.

Father, Sons, Holy Ghosts,

your silent God
doesn't care about you.

No one cares about you,
you're all alone.

Your world ends now!

JOSIE: Sophia,
come find me if you can.

The only thing coming for you,
little mouse,

is the end of your world.

I promise

with all my heart, mind,
and might.

I know where you're hiding,
little mouse.

To always be prepared,
carry the burden,

fix the broken.

Nothing any of you did here
matter.

Protect the preyed upon.

I will still open the door
tonight.

And be strong.

And what comes through that door
will remake this world.

Brave.

Starting with the annihilation
of this family.

Honest and true.

And there's not a thing
you can do to stop it.

In all that I do.

Little mouse.

(Taking deep breaths)

Let her go!

Do you know the agony I can
deliver to this child here?

10 seconds!
What?

These are your carotid arteries,
they carry oxygen to your brain.

If I puncture them both,

your brain goes dark
in 10 seconds.

You don't wanna kill me.

Well,
I don't want to kill anyone!

Which is why
I'm giving you one chance,

but only one!

(Taking deep breaths)

You let her go,
you put down your knife,

and you lay face down
or I bleed you out.

Not a single word,
not a single syllable!

You do as I say or you die.

Run.

Ready or not, make your choice.

Oh, little m...


Run, Sophia!

10!
(Screaming)

9!
(Grunting)

JOSIE:
8!

7!


6!

5!

4!
(Grunting)

3!
(Grunting)

No!


We carry on.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)



Josie.

It's okay, it's all over.

(Taking deep breaths)

THE WOMAN:
Power, unholy and unspeakable.

Power to remake this weak world
in our image,

Power to cheat death
and live forever.

We're safe now.

THE WOMAN:
In darkness.

Mustard Seed's honor.

THE WOMAN:
We are the divide.

We carry on.
