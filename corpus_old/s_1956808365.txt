HEY, FLAPJACK.

COME WITH ME!

WE'LL GO AND SEE A PLACE CALLED CANDIED ISLAND!

>> Bubbie: â™ª WHO NEEDS CANDIED ISLAND? â™ª

â™ª IT'S SAFER AT THE DOCKS â™ª >> K'nuckles: â™ª BUT THERE AIN'T

NO STREAMS OF SODIE POP TO GO DRIPPIN' DOWN THE ROCKS â™ª

>> Bubbie: â™ª IT'S DANGEROUS AND RISKY â™ª

>> K'nuckles: â™ª BUT ADVENTUROUS AND FREE â™ª

>> Flapjack: â™ª ADVENTURE, THAT'S THE LIFE FOR ME â™ª

>> K'nuckles: â™ª THERE'S LOLLIPOP TREES AND A LEMONADE SEA! â™ª

>> Bubbie: DOESN'T SOUND VERY GOOD TO ME.

THIS HOT SUN'S MELTING YOU!

PEPPERMINT LARRY!

>> HUH? CANDY WIFE!

[ GASPING ] JUST BREATHE!

[ BREATHING RHYTHMICALLY ] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6!

[ BREATHING RHYTHMICALLY ] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6!

OH, CANDY WIFE, WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT SUNBATHING?

FLAPJACK, YOU SAVED CANDY WIFE!

YOU'RE A HERO!

HOW CAN I EVER REPAY YOU?

>> K'nuckles: CAN I, UH, LICK YOUR FINGERS?

[ SLOOP! ] >> DID I HEAR SOMEONE SAY

"HERO"?

>> YES! THIS BOY'S A HERO!

HE SAVED CANDY WIFE!

>> THIS ACT OF HEROISM WOULD MAKE A GREAT STORY IN THE

SCUTTLEBUTT.

>> Flapjack: ME IN THE SCUTTLEBUTT?!

OH, MY GOODNESS!

[ GIGGLES ] >> NOW, HOLD STILL, MY LITTLE

HERO, WHILE I MAKE YOU LOOK EXTRA HEROIC FOR THE  SCUTTLEBUTT

PORTRAIT.

>> Flapjack: [ GIGGLES ] THIS IS THE PROUDEST DAY OF MY

LIFE!

>> HOLD STILL SO I CAN PAINT YOU!

>> BRAVE, COMPASSIONATE, DETERMINED, JOVIAL...

>> Flapjack: [ GIGGLING LOUDLY ] >>  EXTREMELY  JOVIAL -- THESE ARE

THE WORDS THAT DESCRIBE OUR YOUNG HERO.

>> Flapjack: OH, YOU'RE TOO MUCH.

>> K'nuckles: YEAH, YEAH.

SPEAKING OF "MUCH," UH, HOW MUCH  DOES THIS INTERVIEW PAY?

>> WE ARE A NONPROFIT PUBLICATION OF REPUTABLE

JOURNALISTS.

>> K'nuckles: WHA?!

>> WE DON'T PAY.

>> K'nuckles: COME ON, FLAP, LET'S GO.

>> BUT THINK OF ALL THE PUBLICITY YOU'LL GET WHEN

STORMALONG  SEES THAT CAPTAIN K'NUCKLES RAISED THIS

HEROIC PRODIGY.

YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

>> K'nuckles: HMM.

AND  THAT'S  HOW FLAPJACK SAVED CANDY WIFE -- THANKS TO  ME

RAISING HIM UP TO BE A HERO AND ALL.

DID I MENTION THAT?

>> YES, ABOUT 20 TIMES.

>> I WANT TO HEAR IT AGAIN!

>> K'nuckles: IT'S GETTING LATE, BOYS.

YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT IT IN THE SCUTTLEBUTT  TOMORROW.

>> THE  SCUTTLEBUTT?!

ONLY THE BEST ADVENTURERS GET IN THERE, LIKE THIS GUY!

>> â™ª A REAL ADVENTURER! â™ª >> K'nuckles: AH, FLAP'S  WAY

BETTER THAN THAT CLOWN.

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] >> Flapjack: OH, ALL THIS

[ LAUGHTER ] >> K'nuckles: HE'S NOT A GOOF!

HE'S A HERO!

THE  SCUTTLEBUTT  SAYS SO!

>> WHO CARES WHAT IT SAYS?

>> YEAH, I JUST LOOK AT THE PICTURES.

[ LAUGHTER ] >> OH, WHAT A GOOF!

[ LAUGHS ] >> THERE'S THE GUY THAT  RAISED

[ LAUGHTER ] >> Flapjack: OH, ALL THIS

ATTENTION!

[ LAUGHTER ] >> K'nuckles: [ GRUNTS ]

>> Flapjack: CAP'N?

CAP'N, W-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

>> K'nuckles: I'M SORRY, BUT I'VE GOT TO PROTECT THE

K'NUCKLES LEGEND.

I CAN'T PAL AROUND WITH A GOOF.

>> Flapjack: BUT MAYBE I COULD CHANGE.

MAYBE I CAN MAKE YOU PROUD OF ME.

>> K'nuckles: NAH.

>> Flapjack: [ CRYING ] [ CRYING LOUDLY ]

>> Bubbie: WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF YOURSELF, HURTING MY

BABY'S FEELINGS BECAUSE OF A STUPID PICTURE IN THE PAPER.

>> K'nuckles: THAT'S IT, FLAP!

I KNOW HOW YOU CAN MAKE ME PROUD!

>> Flapjack: HOW?

>> K'nuckles: YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR FACE  BACK  IN THE

SCUTTLEBUTT,  WITH A  NON-GOOFY EXPRESSION ON IT!

>> â™ª NON-GOOFY EXPRESSION! â™ª >> Flapjack: [ SNIFFLES ]

Thank you, Cap'n.

>> K'nuckles: HERE'S THE PLAN, BOY.

LOLLY AND I WILL BREAK INTO A FIGHT, AND  YOU'LL  COME IN AND

STOP US.

YOU'LL BE SO HEROIC, YOU'LL BE IN THE  SCUTTLEBUTT  FOR SURE.

>> Flapjack: [ GIGGLING LOUDLY ] I MEAN...RIGHT.

>> K'nuckles: NOW, GO WAIT OVER THERE TILL I GIVE YOU THE

SIGNAL.

>> Flapjack: OKAY.

[ GIGGLES ] >> K'nuckles: YOU READY, LOLLY?

>> OH, YEAH.

YOU  TAKE THAT BACK, K'NUCKLES!

>> K'nuckles: NO WAY!

I'LL  SAY WHAT I WANT!

THIS IS  MY  TOWN!

>> OH!

YOU WANT TO START SOMETHING, OLD MAN?

>> K'nuckles: YOU BET I DO!

>> LET'S DO THIS, THEN!

>> FINISH HIM, LOLLY!

>> K'nuckles: YOU'RE GONNA REGRET THIS.

>> Flapjack: [ GASPS ] HERE I COME!

MEN! MEN!

VIOLENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER TO OUR PROBLEMS.

BUT I KNOW WHAT IS...

HUGGING!

[ GIGGLING LOUDLY ] >> OH, IT'S JUST THAT GOOFY KID

AGAIN.

>> YEAH, HIM AND HIS GOOFY FRIENDS.

>> K'nuckles: HMM, TIME FOR PLAN "B."

SOMEBODY! SAVE ME!

I GOT STUCK UP HERE, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET DOWN!

SOMEBODY! HELP ME!

>> Flapjack:  I'LL  SAVE YOU!

OH!

>> [ GRUNTS LOUDLY ] â™ª AHA! â™ª

â™ª AHA! â™ª YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

THE CRATES WILL HURT YOU NO MORE.

>> OH!

ANOTHER STORY FOR YOU, SIR.

YOU ARE ON FIRE THIS WEEK.

>> ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN ON FIRE SINCE I WAS BIRTHED.

>> [ CHUCKLES ] GOOD STUFF, GOOD STUFF.

I AM GOING TO USE THAT.

>> Flapjack: CAP'N, IT DIDN'T WORK.

>> K'nuckles: NO, FLAPJACK,  WE DIDN'T WORK.

>> Flapjack: W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

>> K'nuckles: YOU'RE A GOOF, FLAPJACK.

THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.

SAVE ME!

>> â™ª AHA! â™ª >> K'nuckles: YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN

NOW, BOY.

>> â™ª AHA! â™ª >> Flapjack: CAP'N'S RIGHT.

I'M JUST A BIG OLD GOOF.

I'M NEVER GONNA MAKE HIM PROUD OF ME!

>> HEY, KID, YOU WANT TO MAKE SOMEONE PROUD?

>> Flapjack: YEAH!

>> WELL, THEN, ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS PUSH THIS CRATE INTO THE

WATER.

YOU'LL GET INTO THE PAPER FOR SURE.

>> Flapjack: REALLY?

>> YEAH, KID.

THAT CRATE IS FULL OF POISON.

YOU'LL BE A HERO AND SAVE ALL OF STORMALONG.

>> Flapjack: BUT HOW COME YOU GUYS DON'T DO IT?

>> WELL, 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT STRONG...LIKE YOU.

>> Flapjack: [ GASPS ] THEN K'NUCKLES WILL BE PROUD OF

ME?

>> YEAH, KID.

YOU'LL BE  ROLLING  IN PRIDE.

>> Flapjack: OH, BOY!

[ GRUNTING ] I DID IT!

I'M GONNA MAKE IT INTO THE SCUTTLEBUTT!

WAIT TILL K'NUCKLES HEARS ABOUT THIS!

WHERE IS MY MEDICINE?!

N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!

>> HMM. A CRATE, YOU SAY?

>> Flapjack: YES!

>> FLAPJACK, I RUN A NEWSPAPER HERE, NOT A CHARITY.

I COULD RUN A RETRACTION ON YOUR OTHER STORY IF I GOT SOME

INFORMATION WRONG.

>> Flapjack: OOH, OOH!

OR YOU COULD CHANGE MY PICTURE.

WE NEED TO RUN THAT AGAIN.

>> FLAPJACK, WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK WHEN YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE

SOMETHING NEWSWORTHY?

>> [ GASPING ] >> Flapjack: OH!

>> HEY, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GO-- WAIT!

YOU'RE THE KID FROM THE NEWSPAPER.

YOU SAVED ME MARRIAGE.

>> Flapjack: REALLY? HOW?

>> YOU BROUGHT LAUGHTER BACK INTO OUR HOUSEHOLD.

[ CHUCKLES ] [ LAUGHS ]

[ LAUGHING LOUDLY ] >> Flapjack: YOU KNOW, I DON'T

NEED TO HAVE MY PICTURE IN THE SCUTTLEBUTT.

K'NUCKLES MIGHT NOT BE PROUD OF ME, BUT I AM!

[ SNIFFLES ] AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS!

[ CRIES ] THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

>> WAIT.

FLAPJACK, DID YOU SAY YOU, UH, PUSHED A CRATE IN THE WATER?

>> Flapjack: YES.

>> I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF YOURSELF, KID.

>> K'nuckles: WELL, I'M PROUD OF YOU, FLAP.

>> THANKS, FLAPJACK.

>> Flapjack: A FAMOUS PERSON KNOWS MY NAME!

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! ME!

OUT OF THIS ENTIRE CROWD!

>> ACTUALLY, FLAPJACK, I'M NOT AS FAMOUS AS YOU'D THINK.

IN FACT, I'M PRETTY MUCH BROKE.

EVERYTHING I HAD, I SPENT ON THESE CURTAINS.

AND THAT'S AN EVICTION NOTICE.

>> Flapjack: LOLLY!

>> [ SIGHS ] IT'S BEEN MY LIFELONG DREAM TO

BE A COMEDIAN, BUT IT JUST ISN'T PAYING THE BILLS.

MOTHER WAS RIGHT -- I'M NOT FUNNY.

>> Flapjack: [ GASPS ] THAT'S NOT TRUE, LOLLY.

YOUR JOKES BRING JOY AND LAUGHTER TO THOSE WHO ARE BLUE.

>> THEN WHY DON'T I GET PAID?

>> Flapjack: WELL...MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR JOKES TO

PEOPLE.

>> HUH?

>> Flapjack: PEOPLE HAVE MONEY.

>> AH!

>> Flapjack: AND THEN YOU'LL SEE HOW MUCH EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.

>> YOU'RE RIGHT, FLAPJACK.

I NEED TO GO WHERE THE MONEY IS.

[ Echoing ] MONEY IS, MONEY IS, MONEY IS, MONEY IS.

>> Flapjack: YOU READY TO GO MAKE SOME MONEY, LOLLY?

>> I DON'T KNOW.

I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

>> Flapjack: DON'T BE.

JUST REMEMBER, YOU'RE HILARIOUS!

NOW GO MAKE YOUR DREAM...

come true.

>> HOWDY, FOLKS!

>> WHAT?

>> THAT'LL TEACH YOU FOR TRYING TO ROB A BANK, FUNNY MAN.

>> WELL, THAT DIDN'T WORK.

>> Flapjack: OH, CHEER UP, LOLLY.

WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

AND I KNOW JUST WHERE.

>> I HOPE YOU GUYS SAVED SOME ROOM FOR COMEDY BECAUSE I GOT

BUCKETS  OF MATERIAL.

[ ALL GRUMBLING ] OKAY, WHAT DO YOU CALL A STACK

OF CARDS THAT'S TIRED OF LOLLIPOPS?

A LOLLY  POOPED  DECK...

OF CARDS.

[ RIM SHOT ] >> Flapjack: [ LAUGHS ]

[ ALL GRUMBLING ] >> WHAT DO YOU CALL A SHIP WITH

LOLLIPOPS ON IT THAT MOVES AT AN INCREDIBLY SLOW RATE?

LO-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O- O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-

LOLLY POOPDECK.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- LOLLY POOPDECK.

TIME, I'M GONNA LOSE IT!

>> LET'S THROW SOMETHING AT HIM.

>> HMPH.

>> ALL I GOT IS SOME MONEY.

>> THAT'LL WORK.

>> OHH! AAH!

>> TAKE THAT!

>> [ GASPS ] SWEET COMPENSATION!

>> HUH?

HEY, YOU!

I DON'T WANT MY CUSTOMERS THROWING AWAY THEIR MONEY UNLESS

IT'S ON CANDY!

>> OHH!

>> AND STAY OUT, YOU BUM!

>> THAT'S WHAT MOTHER USED TO SAY.

NOBODY CARES FOR MY JOKES...

OR ME.

>> Flapjack: OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE, LOLLY.

>> BUT NOBODY WANTS TO PAY ME!

>> Flapjack: MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T KNOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

PAY YOU.

YOU JUST GOT TO TELL THEM, "HEY, MISTERS, YOU DON'T GIVE ME ANY

MONEY, I DON'T GIVE YOU ANY JOKES!"

YOU  ALL  THINK HE'S FUNNY!

NOW PAY HIM SOME MONEY!

>> THE PEANUT GALLERY DESERVES A SALARY.

>> Flapjack: THIS CAN'T WAIT!

YOU NEED TO DONATE!

IF YOU WANT TO LAUGH...

>> PAY ME TIME AND A HALF.

>> Flapjack: [ LAUGHS ] GOOD ONE, LOLLY.

>> K'nuckles: FLAPJACK, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

>> Flapjack: LOLLY.

>> K'nuckles: LOLLY, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

>> IT'S ABOUT ME AND NOT GETTING PAID.

DR. BARBER GETS PAID.

PEPPERMINT LARRY GETS PAID.

THE WORDS COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH ARE PRICELESS.

MY MOUTH SHOULD BE FILLED WITH MONEY.

>> Flapjack: YEAH!

>> K'nuckles: REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN YOU DISAPPEARED FOR

THREE YEARS?

>> OH, YEAH.

I-I TOOK A TRIP. IT WAS NICE.

>> K'nuckles: NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE ASKED WHERE YOU WERE.

>> WELL, NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING, RIGHT?

>> K'nuckles: I DON'T REMEMBER.

IT DOESN'T MATTER.

>> OF COURSE IT MATTERS!

>> K'nuckles: YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, DO

YOU?

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?!

COME ON, FLAP, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

>> Flapjack: LOLLY NEEDS ME.

>> K'nuckles: HAVE FUN HANGING OUT WITH A BUM.

>> Flapjack: HE DOESN'T MEAN IT, LOLLY.

>> HEY, YOU BUMS, GET AWAY FROM MY DOOR!

>> I AM  NOT  A BUM, PEPPERMINT LARRY!

I AM A COMEDIAN!

AAH! OHH!

>> Flapjack: [ GASPS ] >> HA! DID YOU SEE THAT?!

IT'S THAT IDIOT LOLLY POOPDECK!

[ BOTH LAUGH ] >> [ LAUGHS ]

>> [ SIGHS ] >> Flapjack: WHERE ARE YOU

GOING, LOLLY?

>> I'M FINISHED.

I QUIT COMEDY FOR GOOD.

>> THE DREAM IS GONE.

I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO MY MOM.

>> Flapjack: WHO'S GONNA BRING LAUGHTER TO STORMALONG?

>> GOODBYE, FLAPJACK.

STORMALONG'S GONNA HAVE TO DO WITHOUT LAUGHTER.

>> Flapjack: OH, LOLLY, STORMALONG NEEDS YOUR JOKES.

AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THE WHOLE TOWN KNOWS IT!

HEY, MISTER!

>> WHAT?

>> Flapjack: WHAT DO YOU CALL A LOLLIPOP THAT POKES SOMEBODY AND

GETS PUNCHED REALLY HARD?

>> [ CHUCKLES ] I DON'T KNOW. WHAT?

>> Flapjack: EXACTLY!

YOU  DON'T  KNOW WHAT TO CALL THAT, AND YOU NEVER WILL!

>> OH.

>> Flapjack: EXCUSE ME!

WHAT DO FRENCH PEOPLE CALL THE DECK OF A SHIP THAT'S NAMED

AFTER A SAILOR WHO MADE A MISTAKE WITH HIS MOUTH?

>> I DON'T KN-- >> Flapjack: WELL, ME NEITHER,

I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT FRENCH PEOPLE CALL THAT!

BUT I KNOW WHO DOES KNOW...

HE'S SPOILING MY VIEW!

WHAT GOES ON HERE, YOUNG MAN?

>> Flapjack: DO YOU LIKE TO LAUGH, MA'AM?

>> WHY, YES.

I JUST LAUGHED THE OTHER DAY WHEN CHARLES HERE ACCIDENTALLY

PASSED GAS.

[ CHUCKLES ] >> THAT WAS MILADY, MILADY.
