[alarm rings]
[shrieks]


[squeaking, chattering]

Huh?



[shrieks, chatters]


[Snoopy snoring]

[Woodstock squeaks]

[snoring continues]


[winds clock]
[alarm rings]

[alarm stops]

[Snoopy gasps]


[Snoopy gasps]
[chatters]

Whoa. [grunts]

Come on, Sally. I can't be late.
I'm the one who scheduled this practice.

Right behind you, big brother.

[Charlie Brown] Whoops. Heads up!

Good morning, Charlie Brown.

Good morning, Linus, Lucy.
Are you ready for today's practice?

Why do we even bother with practice?
We never win any games.

That's exactly why. I'm tired of losing.

Look at it this way, Charlie Brown,

we learn more from losing
than we do from winning.

That must make me
the smartest person in the world.

Aren't you going to say good morning
to me, my Sweet Babboo?

I'm not your Sweet Babboo!

What's the plan, Charlie Brown?

New uniforms? New playbook?
A new quarterback?

No, a new coach.

Hmm. Maybe you're not such
a blockhead after all.

Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Marcie.

I've been reading up on football.

I'm ready to get out there
and kick around the old hogskin.

It's pigskin, Marcie.
And everything isn't "old" in football.

Whatever you say, sir.

And don't call me "sir."
Today it's "Coach."

All right, listen up.

[chatter stops]

Chuck hereâ€¦
Ah.

â€¦has asked me to help his team
get in shape for next season.

Nothing like a good challenge.

[Linus gulps]

Ready to get to work? Good.

I like to start my warm-ups
with 100 jumping jacks.

Marcie?

You heard her. Jump!
[inhales sharply, blows]

[blows whistle] One, two, threeâ€¦
[huffing]

â€¦four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

11, 12, 13â€¦
[huffing continues]

Sorry I'm late, Coach.
Hope you have a good excuse, Pigpen.

I do. The line at the candy store sure was
backed up due to Mother's Day tomorrow.

[Charlie Brown] What?

That's tomorrow? I can't believe
I almost forgot Mother's Day.

Mother's Day is special.

Cut the chitchat, Chuck.

Marcie, where were we?

I, uh... I lost count. [giggles]

Oh, forget it.

Time for a little demonstration.
What you're about to see

is some real down-in-the-dirt,
slam-bang, rock-'em-sock-'em football.

Marcie, bring 'em in.


[inhales sharply, blows whistle]


[Peppermint Patty] Keep your eyes
on the kid with the funny nose.

Look at those moves.

Okay, kid. Enough with the moves.

[Woodstock shrieks, groans]

Let's start with a simple kick.

All right, tee it up!



Uh, nice hit, little guy.

Shake it off. Forget the kick.
Let's do the passing play.

I never know what my mother would like.
You're clever, Linus. What are you doing?

Well, every day my mom puts
these little notes in my lunch sack,

just like this one.

"Dear Son, study hard.

Remember, all you need
to find true happiness

is already there within you.

The lunch is just a bonus. Love, Mom."

She gets carried away sometimes.

[Peppermint Patty]
Now go straight out and cut right.

Now left. Now cut back.

[all gasp]


Don't come back.
It's a pass, not a return.

This year, I decided to write
a special letter back to thank her.

Unfortunately,
I still need to figure out what to say.

Writing is not really my strong suit.

[Charlie Brown] "Roses are... [grunts]
Violets are"... [grunting]

This isn't the play! Tackle that guy.

Can he even hear me?

What are you guys doing?

I'm making Mom a gift
that will be a true artistic masterpiece.

Oh, really? What's that?

If I knew, I'd tell you!

What are you getting your mom?
She's been really nice lately,

so I upped her gift
to a crisp five-dollar bill.

How thoughtful of you.

Cold, hard cash.

You don't have the ball.

I'm writing a sonata for my mom.

I call it, "You're the Best Mom,"
in F major.

My mom loves hugs,

so I'm making her
a coupon book full of them.

Stop! Look behind you.

[both shrieking]

[Peppermint Patty] Not bad
for a little guy. Run! Go, go go!

[squeaks, grunts]

[Snoopy sobbing]
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

Not pretty, but it's a touchdown!

Did you get allâ€¦ that?
[chattering]

Mother's Day.
Happy Mother's Day.

Isn't Mother's Day the best?

Happy Mother's Day.
I love Mother's Day.



May I have your attention?

Unless you all have something better
you'd rather be doing?

Actually, I need to go
to the craft store for art supplies.

I need to make more coupons.

I still have to work on the last movement
of my sonata.

A card would go nicely
with my box of chocolates.

I should be writing my letter.


I'll call you to set up
another practice soon.

All right, go ahead and leave.

But don't blame me
when you lose next season.

[Woodstock gasps]



At least someone isn't distracted
by stupid Mother's Day.

[gasps, chatters]


[Woodstock chattering]
[gasps]

You too? Everyone deserted me. Ugh.

Not everyone, Coach. Sir.



[metallic clanging]
[squeaks]



[squeaks softly]

[whistles, squeaks]


[gasps, chatters]





[tweet]
[squeaks]



[whimpers, pants]

[all cheering]



[Woodstock screams]
[mother squeaks]








Ooh!

[squeaks]
[Woodstock] Huh?


[both squeaking]

[Woodstock chattering]

Now, here's the sneaky part.

I turn back and do a fake-o pass
to the running back.

But then I keep the ball to myself,

do a few tricky moves
to avoid the other side,

and run down the field for a touchdown.

Sirâ€¦

[panting and grunting]
This is all very interesting, sir,

but maybe we should do this
when the other players are here.

No. I refuse to change my plans
just because of Mother's Day. [pants]

Maybe we could find something else
that's fun to do.

Who says I'm not having fun?

Is this the face of a person
not having fun?

Do you want to talk about it, sir?
No.

Sir, I'm really sorry
you don't have a mom.

I just don't understand
why Mother's Day's such a big deal.

Mother's Day isâ€¦ dumb!


[inhales deeply, sighs]

It's nice that we've opened up
this line of communication, sir.


[grunts, groans]

You should just go home, Marcie.

I'm sure you have some things
you need to prepare for tomorrow.

Taken care of, sir. I made cupcakes.

I would rather stay here with you.

It's the same every year.

I'm having a good day,
and then someone brings up Mother's Day.

And suddenly I'm reminded that
I'm the only kid who doesn't have a mom.

It must be difficult, sir.

It really is, Marcie.

Last year, I pretended to be sick

so I didn't have to go
to school that week.

I remember. You came down
with a case of the yuckies.

If you want,
you can spend Mother's Day at my house.

I don't mind sharing my mom.

Your mom's nice,
but it's just not the same.

Is there anything I can do to help?

I don't know, Marcie.

Can you make Mother's Day go away
and never come back again?

Uh, I'm afraid not, sir.

I didn't think so.

Let's go return Chuck's football.

"To my mom." Hmm. No.

"Mommy dearest." Uh, no. [sighs]

"O mother of mine." [groans]

"Hey, Mom." [groans]

Letter writing is a lost art.

"Mother."

Move over, Linus.
Wha... Uh?

I need the table to make
my special Mother's Day present.

It's going to be a portrait of Mom
done in watercolor.

She's going to take one look at it
and say,

"That picture belongs
at the top of the fridge."

Sounds like a great idea.

I believe the best gifts
come from the heart.

Heart, schmeart. This is art.

Being a great artist means
having discipline, concentration,

and never rushing your masterpiece.

Done!

Uh, have you looked at Mom recently?

[yells, grunts]

I think I'll make something else.
Something inspired.

Whew. There's a fine line
between honest and too honest.

Aren't you going to ring the doorbell?

I don't want to see anybody.

[groans]
Do you want to borrow my handkerchief?

I'm not crying, I'm thinking.

They sort of look like
the same thing sometimes.

Well, it's here if you want it.


Maybe because you miss your mom?

I never had a mom. How could I miss her?

Well, maybe you miss what moms do,

like making your favorite cookies

and putting a bandage on your finger
when you have a cut

and singing your favorite song?

I don't miss those things.

My dad does all that mom stuff for me.
He's the best. [gasps]

Your dad is very nice.

Are you okay, sir?

Marcie,
there are all types of moms, right?

Of course. Foster kids have terrific moms.

So do adopted kids.
Some kids even have two moms.

Right. And even kids like me, with no mom,
can have someone who acts like a mom.

And all those moms deserve
to be celebrated, don't you think?

Sure they do.


For Mother's Day,
I'm going to celebrate my dad.

It's so simple.

All I have to do is get him
one of those Mother's Day gifts.

Like a card?

Yes, that's it! A card!

I get him a card. And bang!
No more yuckies. Problem solved.

Marcie, you're a genius!

I am?

I can't believe
it's already Mother's Day tomorrow.

Wasn't it just Mother's Day last year?

It happens every year.

But stay focused, Sally.
We need to think of a special gift.

[clock ticking]
Hmm.

[ticking continues]
Mmm.



What does Mom always say
is her favorite meal?

The one she doesn't have to cook.

Exactly.

Well, tomorrow we're going to
make her breakfast in bed.

Won't that make her sheets soggy?

I don't think you understand
the finer details of breakfast in bed.

It's served on a tray,
and it's very classy.

It sounds messy to me.

Trust me, she's going to love it.

But we should do a test run first.

Bring me the good plates
from the china cabinet.

Aye, aye, big brother.

Hmm.


[groans, grunts]

Ooh.


Whoa. [screams]

Whoa. [screams] Whoa!

Whoa. [screams, grunts]

[clattering, clanging]

Wha... Huh?


I thought you said
breakfast in bed wasn't messy.

Good grief.


Uh-huh.


[Snoopy] Nuh-uh.
[Woodstock whines, chatters]

Hmm.







[shrieks]
[shrieks]





[squeaks]
[grunts]


[both yelling]

[yelling continues]

[gasps, yells]


[Woodstock grunts]
[Snoopy gasps]


[Woodstock chattering]

[both yelling]




[grunts, panting]


[shouting continues]

[both shouting]

[Woodstock whistles]

[Snoopy] Hmm?
[shouting]




[bell chimes]

We have arrived. All right.

We're looking for a Mother's Day card
that says,

"Thanks, Dad,
for being such a good mother."

That soundsâ€¦ logical.

"Dear Mother,
your smile brightens my day." No.

"Dear Mother, my love for you"... [scoffs]

"To a mother sweeter than sugar."
Not that one either.

Where are the Mother's Day cards
he'd like?

Some trucks or sports
or a little bit of flannel?

These are all flowery and mushy. [gasps]

"Mother, O Mother!" Oh, brother.

No. Never. Nope.



I don't believe it.
There's nothing here for my dad.

Have you seen any cards that say,

"Happy Mother's Day
to the world's greatest grandma"?

I want one that's short and sweet,
just like her.


"There is no other like my grandmother.

Happy Mother's Day
to the world's greatest grandma."

This is perfect.
Huh?

Thank you. Oh, Marcie.

[Peppermint Patty grumbles]

Excuse me.

Can you show me where I can find
a Mother's Day card for my father?

[droning adult chatter]

Well, you should expand
your card selection.

Not everyone has the same sort
of family, you know. Sheesh.

Marcie.

Sorry.

Come on.

I refuse to give up.

Let's go.

[bell chimes]
What about ice skates?

He has weak ankles.

What about flowers?
He has allergies.

Some jewelry?
Nice, but too expensive.

How about a cake?

He's more of a salty kind of guy.
[sighs]

A day of pampering?

He hates cucumber.

[trombone playing]

Write him a song?




[squeaking continues]


[teeth chatter]

Aw.

Hmm.

[Snoopy laughing]


[screams, blows]

[Snoopy] Whoo-hoo!
[cheers]

[sighs]
[rumbles]

[Snoopy clears throat]

Aha!


Huh?



Mmm.

[both laughing]


[wind whistling]


[both shrieking]

[Snoopy] Huh?
[squeaks]

[Woodstock squeaking, chattering]


[both scream]





[both scoffing]
[roaring]

[both shriek]

Don't you think cleaning up the kitchen
counts as a gift?

We're running out of time.
Let's keep looking.


Actually, that's not a bad idea.

[droning adult chatter]
One ice cream cake, please.

[droning adult chatter]
Umâ€¦

Strawberry.
Strawberry.

[droning adult chatter]
Make it, umâ€¦

Large.
Large, please.

[droning adult chatter]

Uhâ€¦

Sally, I'm a little short.
Do you have any money?


You know, Mother's Day is just
another commercial scam.

[droning adult chatter]
Thank you, sir.

Should I assume you won't be eating
any of this commercial scam?

Ah, of course I will.

When ice cream is involved,
my principles are totally negotiable.

[bell tinkles]


I suppose you're wondering
where I got this beautiful crown.

It certainly crossed my mind.

I made it to give to my mom tomorrow,

so she can feel what it's like
to be queen for a day.

I'm testing it out,
and it feels very good.

Hmm.

I'm never going to find something
for my da...

[exclaims, grunting]

Mother's Day, Mother's Dayâ€¦
Everywhere I go, that's all I hear.

I think if I hear "Mother's Day"
one more time, I'll... I'll scream.

We got my mom an ice cream cake
for Mother's Day.

I was going to get her a vanilla cake
or a chocolate cake for Mother's Day.


But Sally suggested strawberry.

And that seemed like the perfect flavor
for Mother's Day.

Mother's Day. Mother's Day.

[groans, screams]

Whoa!




[gasps, exclaims]

[gasps, exclaims]

It's ruined! Look what you did!


Chuck. It's just... [sighs]

Uh, no time to explain.

Sir, come back.

Apparently Mother's Day
is not her favorite holiday.

Sir? Where are you going?
Home.

All I wanted to do was get my dad
a Mother's Day gift. I couldn't do that.

Maybe we can...
No, Marcie.

Whatever you're going to say,
I don't want to hear it.

Every time you try to help,
I end up feeling worse.

I... I'm sorry, sir.
That was never my intention.

Mother's Day has always been bad for me,
and that's never going to change.

So please, leave me alone.



[groans, sighs]

[Woodstock chattering]





[grunts]
[squeaks]

Hmm.








Aw. [chattering]




[Woodstock groans]

[sniffs, sighs]

I bet ants don't have to
celebrate Mother's Day.

Lucky ants.

Ants are lucky, I suppose.

They always seem to know
where they fit in.


Every now and then, my dad says to me,

"Peppermint Patty,
do you know what you are?"

And I always say no.

Then he says to me, "You are a rare gem."
And then we laugh about it.

But sometimes I wish I wasn't so rare.

I think I understand.

Today everyone was so excited.
More than excited.

They were happy
about celebrating their moms.

And I knew, no matter what I do,
I'll never know how that feels.

And I was angry.

Have you ever thought
maybe your anger is really sadness?


It's okay to cry, sir.


Maybe you could get your dad
something else.

Don't start that again.

I was thinking, sir,
we tried the usual things.

But you are rare.

Is there something you could give him
that could only come from you?

I don't know.

Well, what are your favorite things
to do together?


Everything.

We play baseball.
He taught me all I know about football.

We like to tell each other dumb jokes.
The dumber they are, the more we laugh.

He loves to hear me laugh.
He says it reminds him of my mom.


Huh?
I know how to celebrate Mother's Day.

Tomorrow I'll spend the whole day
with my dad.

We'll play and talk to each other,
and I'm gonna make him laugh.

And he'll make me laugh.

And together
we'll share the biggest laugh ever.

That sounds like the best
Mother's Day gift a father has ever had.

Yeah! Yeah! It does! I gotta go!

[clears throat]

Marcie, if I said anything before
to hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.

You're a true friend. Mmm.
You are too, sir.

[both chuckling]

And wish your mom
a happy Mother's Day for me! [chuckles]

Will do, sir.

[Lucy blows]

This is good.
But is it top-of-the-fridge good?

Ahem.

It's definitely top-of-the-fridge quality.

Oh, thank goodness.

I was starting to think
I had a self-doubt.

But it's still missing something.
What? But you just said...

All cards need a message inside.
It's a rule.

Okay, wise guy. What does your letter say?

Here.

Hmm. [gasps] Aw. Mmm.

Linus. It's...
It's everything I wish I could say.

Well, you know,
my letter needs something to go in.

If you want,
we can put it inside your card

and give them both to Mom together.

You'd do that?

It just needs one little change here.

[clears throat] "Dear Mom,
I'm writing you this letter to thank you

for the notes you put
in my school lunches.

Also, to thank you for my school lunches,
especially the bologna sandwiches,

not so much the tuna fish."
[gags]

"This is my way of thanking you
for all the things you do for me.

<i>When I'm scared,
you give me cuddles and act so sweet.</i>

<i>When I'm lonely,
you call me your 'forever best friend.'</i>

<i>I like that.</i>

<i>You always find the time
to listen to my new ideas."</i>

<i>"You give me lots hugs and kisses,
even in front of my friends,</i>

<i>which is sometimes embarrassing,
but I still like them.</i>

<i>When I make mistakes,
you encourage me to try again and again.</i>

<i>You make sure I'm safe every night.</i>

<i>You give me your best
in your own special way."</i>



Go long, Dad. [chuckles]

Oh, nice catch.


Here's another one.
What did the egg say to the chef?

[droning adult chatter]
"You crack me up."


<i>And then you laugh too,
which makes me laugh even more."</i>


"Mostly I know you're someone who loves me
and will always be there for me.

I guess that's what moms do.
But you do it the best. That's why"...


We really, really, really love you back.
Happy Mother's Day.

[both giggling]


[squeaks]
Aw.

[both chuckling]

[Woodstock sighs]
[Snoopy sighs]


[howling continues]

[all laughing]
