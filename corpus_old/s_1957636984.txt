â™ª



JUST DONâ€™T MAKE HIM STARE TOO LONG.

IT COULD BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY DAMAGING AT HIS AGE.

I WONâ€™T. ZACH.

I WONâ€™T.

COME HERE, BOY.

SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR GRANDDADDY.

SEE?

THATâ€™S ENOUGH.

SEE?

THEREâ€™S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

YOUR GRANDDAD AINâ€™T EVEN THERE.

THATâ€™S JUST HIS SHELL.

LITTLE SPARTA,

NOW, YOUR GRANDDADDY, HE ISNâ€™T REALLY GONE, HONEY.

HEâ€™S--HEâ€™S WITH US.

HEâ€™S WITH US EVERYWHERE,

ONLY HE DOESNâ€™T HAVE THAT BIG OLD,

HEAVY BODY TO CARRY AROUND ANYMORE.

HEâ€™S LIGHT NOW.

YOU SEE, THATâ€™S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE DIE.

THEY BECOME LIGHT ENOUGH TO GO TO HEAVEN.

NOW, THATâ€™S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF, IS IT?

NOW, GO ON, GO SEE YOUR AUNT CHARLOTTE.

I KNOW SHEâ€™S LOOKING FOR YOU.


YEAH, Iâ€™D LIKE TO HAVE A CADILLAC LIKE YOURS.

YOU GOT THAT BIG V-8 IN THERE?


[women speaking quietly]



YOUR SWEET EAR, SPARTA.

YOUR SWEET, SWEET EAR.

WILL YOU FORGIVE YOUR SUGAR BUSH?

OH, MY.

Iâ€™LL GIVE THIS BACK TO YOU IN HEAVEN, SUGARCAKE.

[man coughing]

[conversations overlapping]


OF COURSE, I WOULD NEVER GET A CADDY WITHOUT LEATHER--

DAD.

THOSE ARE LEATHER SEATS? OH, YES.

A CADDY WITHOUT LEATHER SEATS

WOULD BE LIKE A GIRL WITHOUT A BEAU.

DAD. LIKE TITS WITHOUT NIPPLES.

DAD!

LITTLE SPARTA,

COULD YOU BE QUIET FOR A WHILE?

FUNERALS ARE A SOLEMN OCCASION,

AND YOU GOT TO SHUT UP SOMETIMES.


I WANT THE CASKET SEALED IMMEDIATELY.

[Jerry Lee Lewisâ€™ Down the Road a Piece]

â™ª WELL, IF YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME BOOGIE â™ª

â™ª LIKE Iâ€™M GONNA PLAY â™ª

â™ª ITâ€™S JUST AN OLD PIANO BARGE â™ª

IF IT TAKE THAT JOB IN NEW YORK,

Iâ€™LL BE ABLE TO BUY YOU THAT CADDY YOUâ€™VE ALWAYS WANTED.

AW, SUGAR, I WISH YOU WOULDNâ€™T DO THAT.


HOW ABOUT THAT, LITTLE SPARTA?

HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A BIG OLD CADILLAC IN THE FAMILY?

WHATâ€™S THE MATTER WITH HIM? IS HE SICK?

NO...

YOU TOLD HIM TO SHUT UP AT THE FUNERAL PARLOR,

SO HEâ€™S NOT TALKING.

HEâ€™S ANGRY WITH HIS FATHER.

ITâ€™S CALLED PASSIVE AGGRESSION.

ITâ€™S WHAT CHILDREN DO NOWADAYS.

OH, THEY DO, DO THEY? THEY DO.

WELL, THAT DOESNâ€™T SOUND VERY AUDACIOUS TO ME.

THATâ€™S WHAT WEâ€™RE RAISING NOWADAYS,

LITTLE SNIVELING, SPOILED, PASSIVE OFFSPRING

AFRAID OF THEIR OWN SHADOWS.

IF I WERE TO TRY THAT HOKEY0POKEY WITH MY DADDY, YOU KNOW WHAT HEâ€™D SAY?

ZACH, DONâ€™T SAY IT.

HEâ€™D SAY, "YOUâ€™D JUST BETTER SHARPEN UP,

OR ELSE Iâ€™M GONNA HIT YOU SO HARD, YOU WONâ€™T BE ABLE TO GET BACK UP AGAIN."

OH, HELL, DID I JUST MISS THE TURNOFF TO MIRANDAâ€™S?

ITâ€™S TWO MORE, ZACH.

HEY, LITTLE SPARTA,

YOU REMEMBER YOUR AUNT MIRANDA, RIGHT, SPAR?

ASK HER ABOUT INDIANS.

AUNT MIRANDAâ€™S A BIG EXPERT ON INDIANS.

YEAH, SHEâ€™S A REAL EXPERT.


IN THEM AUTHENTIC INDIAN POWWOWS.

HOW ABOUT A WINK FOR THE CAMERA, MISS CHEROKEE QUEEN?


[knock at door]


YEAH?

YOUR FAMILY IS HERE, MIRANDA.

Yâ€™ALL COME ON IN. (Zach) THANK YOU.

MIRANDA, HONEY, YOU LOOK SO GOOD.

Iâ€™D KISS YOU, BUT I SEE YOU GOT YOUR LIPS ALL GUSSIED UP.


MM.

DID YOU PACK YET?

THREE DAYS AGO.


YOU KNOW ITâ€™S ONLY GONNA BE ONE NIGHT

DADDY GOES IN THE GROUND TOMORROW.



AND DONâ€™T GO ASKING HER ABOUT PARTICULARS.

SHEâ€™S BEEN ACTING A LITTLE OFF-KILTER,

AND I THINK IT WOULDNâ€™T HURT

TO GIVE HER SOME TIME TO SORT THINGS OUT

BEFORE WE GO PRYING.

WE GONNA SEE THE BODY FIRST?

WELL, WE THOUGHT, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

THE WAY THINGS WERE BETWEEN YOU AND OLD SPARTA,

THAT YOU YOUâ€™D SOON AS WELL SKIP THAT PART.

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO SEE HIM

AT PEACE FOR A CHANGE.

COME ON, WE GOT TO GO,

OR ELSE THE BARBECUEâ€™S GONNA GET COLD.

LETâ€™S GO.

COME ON.


LADIES.


[Zach grunting]

WHY DONâ€™T YOU SIT UP FRONT WITH THE ADULTS, MARY JOAN?

SPARTA AND I WILL SIT IN BACK HERE.

[radio channels flipping]

[man over radio] TEXANS ARE STILL IN SHOCK

OVER PRESIDENT JOHNSONâ€™S ANNOUNCEMENT...

I DECLARE A THUMB WAR.

[radio channels flipping]

[Miranda laughing]

[country and western music playing]


OH, YOU GOT ME, SPAR.

I REMEMBER WHEN I COULD ALWAYS BEAT YOU.

NOW YOUâ€™RE PRACTICALLY A MAN.

ZACH, IF YOU KEEP ON PLAYING WITH THAT RADIO,

YOUâ€™RE GONNA HAVE TO GET ME A ROOM

AT THAT ASYLUM RIGHT NEXT TO MIRANDAâ€™S.

Iâ€™M JUST TRYING TO FIND YOU A GOOD STATION, SWEETIE.

GODDAMN, YOUâ€™RE IMPATIENT.

"GODDAMN"? IS THAT A WORD YOU WANT OUR LITTLE SPARTA TO BE SAYING?

OUR SON DOESNâ€™T TALK, REMEMBER?

ISNâ€™T THAT RIGHT, LITTLE SPARTA?

SEE?

WE GOT OURSELVES A LITTLE MUTE BOY.

IS THAT TRUE?

YOU DONâ€™T WANT TO TALK?

NOT EVEN TO ME?

HERE WE GO.

THANK THE LORD.

YOUâ€™RE GONNA BE A REAL HEARTBREAKER

WHEN YOU GROW UP-- YOU KNOW THAT, BOY?

(Mary Joan) NOW, HEâ€™S NOT, MIRANDA.

HEâ€™S GONNA BE A GENTLEMAN.

Iâ€™M RAISING LITTLE SPARTA

TO JUST BE A GENTLEMAN.

WELL, GENTLEMEN ARE THE WORST HEARTBREAKERS IN THE WORLD,

BECAUSE THEY JUST LOVE ONE WOMAN

AND LEAVE THE OTHERS TO CRY THEMSELVES AWAY.

HONEY, YOU GONNA SMOKE IN THE CAR?

NO, I WAS GONNA ASK MY BROTHER, THE GENTLEMAN,

IF HE WOULD STOP THE CAR SO A LADY COULD HAVE A SMOKE.

â™ª TEARDROPS FALL

â™ª LIKE RAINDROPS

â™ª WE MAKE MISTAKES

â™ª AND FEEL SORRY

â™ª WHEN WEâ€™VE MADE â™ª

â™ª SOMEONE BLUE

â™ª BUT Iâ€™VE â™ª

â™ª MADE THE GREATEST MISTAKE

THEREâ€™S CLINTONâ€™S NEW CADILLAC.

AMAZING WHAT BLACK GOLD CAN BUY.

ZACH, DONâ€™T START WITH THE WHIT OIL SAGA AGAIN.

WHAT IN GODâ€™S NAME IS MAMA CARRYING ON ABOUT?

ZACH!

ZACH, YOUâ€™VE GOT HELP CLINTON WITH ROBERT E.

HEâ€™S GONE CRAZY.

[woman shouting]

HEâ€™S GONNA KILL CLINTON.


COME ON!


[camel growling]

(Mary Joan) HONEY, BE CAREFUL, NOW.

ALL RIGHT, COME ON, BOY.

CALM DOWN, ROBERT E.

[camel growling] GOD! GOD DAMN IT!


STOP!

JESUS, MARY AND JOSEPH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

GOOD LORD, CLINTON.

YOU COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED, HONEY.

RIGHT BEFORE SPARTA DIED,

ROBERT E. STARTED ACTING KIND OF FUNNY.

THERE YOU GO.

YEAH.

HANK SAID HEâ€™D BE BY LATER TO LOOK AT HIM.


OH, THATâ€™S WALTER.


I THOUGHT HE WAS AWAY AT THAT COLORED MEDICAL SCHOOL.


TO FINISH THE YEAR, SO HEâ€™S WORKING SOME.

HELLO?

MAYBE THE BOY CAN COME VISIT US, YOU KNOW, LATER.

AFTER ALL, WITH DINNER AND THE READING OF THE WILL...

BUT I INVITED HIM HERE BECAUSE OF THE WILL.

MR. CRAWFORD SAYS HEâ€™S IN IT.

Yâ€™ALL WIPE YOUR FEET OFF. Yâ€™ALL WIPE YOUR FEET OFF.

COME ON IN.

HEY, WALTER.

HEY, ZACH. HOW YOU DOING?

OH, Iâ€™M ALL RIGHT.

Iâ€™M REALLY SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT MR. WHIT.

YEAH, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE, THOUGH.

COME ON IN. WHEN DID YOU GET BACK FROM SCHOOL?


BEEN DRIVING A BALER-- YOU WIPE YOUR FEET.


[Clinton clears throat] WALTER, HOW ARE YOU?


THANK YOU, CLINTON.


NEW YORK?

(Mary Joan) OH, YOUâ€™VE BEEN TALKING TO ZACH.

YEAH, BUT NEW YORK?

OF ALL THE PLACES.

I LOVE HIM, BUT HE DOESNâ€™T HAVE A LICK OF SENSE IN HIS HEAD.

HEâ€™S STUBBORN AS ALL GET-GO.

EVEN WHEN HE WAS A CHILD,

YOU COULD TAKE A SWITCH TO ZACH,

AND HEâ€™D TURN RIGHT AROUND AND--

AND JUST RAISE CAIN ALL OVER AGAIN.

MURTIS, YOU KNOW I JUST IGNORE ZACH.

OH! OH!

ARE YOU OKAY?

CHARLOTTE, Iâ€™M ALL RIGHT.

ANYWAY, THE ONLY WAY

WEâ€™RE SEEING NEW YORK IS ON A TOUR BUS.

Iâ€™VE DECIDED THAT. GOOD.

YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT IN NEW YORK

YOU CANâ€™T GO OUT AT NIGHT

OR ELSE A NEGRO WILL JUMP OUT OF A SHADOW

AND SHOOT YOU WITH A BIG OLD GUN.

YOU KNOW, CHARLOTTE, I DONâ€™T BELIEVE THATâ€™S TRUE.

WELL, CLINTON TOLD ME SO.

OOOH, THAT PECAN PIE LOOKS LOVELY. HA HA!

THANK YOU.

OH, I DIDNâ€™T KNOW WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING DESSERT.

WE WERENâ€™T. I JUST DID IT LAST MINUTE.


ITâ€™S A THREE-CHOCOLATE MOUSSE.

WELL, HONEY, YOU JUST BRING IT NEXT TIME.

Yâ€™ALL NEED ANY HELP?

OH, NO, WE GOT IT COVERED.

HAVE YOU HAD YOUR MEDICATION?

TWICE, SO Iâ€™D BE DOUBLY SANE TONIGHT.

HONEY, PLEASE DONâ€™T-- DONâ€™T DO THAT IN HERE.

ITâ€™S SO NICE, AND IT SMELLS LIKE PIE.


THATâ€™S ALL WELL AND GOOD. THAT WILL PLEASE THE MISSUS.

SHE WERENâ€™T BORN WITH MUCH, BLESS HER HEART,

BUT SHE SURE HAS A TASTE FOR FINER THINGS.

I TOLD HER, "YOU LISTEN..."

NOW, YOU CLIMB ON IN THERE AND SIT IN THAT BUCKET SEAT.

HUH? GOOD?

ITâ€™S NICE.


I SURE DO.

WHATâ€™S THE MOST EXPENSIVE VEHICLE YOUâ€™VE EVER DRIVEN IN?

M48 TANK, CREW TWO, SOUTH SAIGON. [laughs]

[camel bellowing]

YOU KNOW, YOU OUGHT TO GET YOURSELF ONE OF THESE, ZACH.

THEYâ€™RE NOT THAT EXPENSIVE IF YOU DONâ€™T GET ONE

WITH ALL THE DOODADS IN THEM LIKE I HAVE.

WELL, MARY JOANâ€™S BEEN AFTER ME

SINCE I-CANâ€™T-REMEMBER TO GET HER ONE.

I PROMISED HER, IF I TAKE THAT JOB UP IN NEW YORK, Iâ€™D SEE ABOUT IT.


THAT SEEMS LIKE THE END OF THE EARTH.

ARE YOU SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THAT?

THEREâ€™S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THERE.

WELL, THAT COULD BE A GOOD PLAY, THOUGH--

YOU GO UP NORTH AND WORK A COUPLE OF YEARS

AND COME BACK HOME WITH A BETTER RESUME.

YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

I FIGURE WEâ€™D MAKE SOME MONEY

AND MAYBE SET A LITTLE BIT ASIDE,

NOT LIKE YOU AND CHARLOTTE, OF COURSE,

BUT ENOUGH THAT I CAN INVEST A BIT IN THE STOCK MARKET.

STOCK MARKET? I WOULDNâ€™T MESS WITH THAT.

ITâ€™S AN AWFUL BAD TIME.

YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF SMART FELLAS

WHO HAVE BEEN LOSING THEIR SHIRTS.

IF I WERE YOU, Iâ€™D JUST, YOU KNOW, HOLD ON TO WHAT YOU GOT.

YEAH, WELL, IF YOU DONâ€™T RISK IT,

YOU DONâ€™T DRINK CHAMPAGNE.

AND WHAT IF YOUâ€™RE DADDY HADNâ€™T RISKED DRILLING

THAT OIL WELL OUT THERE?

YOU KNOW, Iâ€™M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING.

MONEY IS A FUNNY THING, ZACH.

NOW, THEREâ€™S SOME FELLAS, THEYâ€™LL SPIT ON A SEED,

THEYâ€™LL GROW A FOREST, AND THEN YOU GOT OTHER FELLAS,

THEYâ€™LL TURN A GARDEN OF EDEN INTO A DESERT.

YEAH, I RECKON SO.

[faint eerie noises]

[breathing deeply]

[rattling noise]

[thunder booming]


Iâ€™VE GOT TO LOOK AFTER HERE.

JUST HANG ON, NOW.

HI.


WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE, DID YOU?

YOU KNOW YOUR OLD GRANDPA BETTER THAN THAT.

YOU LOOK NONE THE WORSE SINCE I LEFT.

WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME FOR OLD ROBERT E.

COME ON OVER HERE, WILL YA?

THATâ€™S MY BOY.


ARE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE ME?

WELL, Iâ€™M FULL OF SURPRISES.

LETâ€™S GET STARTED.

THEREâ€™S SOME OLD FELLAS UPSTAIRS CHOMPINâ€™ AT THE BIT TO MEET YOU.

UP WE GO, COME ON.

DAMN IT TO HELL!

SORRY FOR MY LANGUAGE, BOY.

I JUST WISH YOUR GRANDMOTHER WOULD STOP MESSINâ€™ WITH MY EAR.

COME ON.

(man #1) THATâ€™S TEN, GRANDDAD.

TELL HIM, DADDY.

(man #2) YOU CANâ€™T PUT THAT DOWN THERE; TAKE THAT BACK.

I SURE CAN. WHY CANâ€™T HE?

WHY--TELL HIM, DAD.

POP, YOU-- YOU TAUGHT HIM.

(man #2) YEAH, I TAUGHT HIM,

BUT I DIDNâ€™T TEACH HIM TO CHEAT LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

AND LIKE Iâ€™M GONNA PLAY THIS DOUBLE DEUCE RIGHT THERE.


WHOA, HE DOES IT TO US EVERY TIME.

THERE HE IS. THERE IS OUR BOY.

(man #2) THATâ€™S OUR BOY.

LITTLE SPARTA,

THIS HERE IS YOUR GREAT-GREAT-GREAT- GRANDDADDY, LUCAS,

SHAKE IS HAND.

ENCHANTE.

BOY, HEâ€™S GOT A GRIP.

HEâ€™S GOT A GRIP AS GOOD AS MINE, BOYS.


UH, GRANDDADDY... UH-HUH?

YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE US?

YEAH, I GUESS SO.

THIS MAMAâ€™S BOY HERE ALL DRESSED UP PRETTY

LIKE HEâ€™S GOING TO SUNDAY CHURCH,

THATâ€™S YOUR GREAT-GRANDDADDY, ACHILLES.

NOW, HEâ€™S THE POLITICIAN IN THE FAMILY.

AND THIS IS YOUR GREAT-GREAT GRANDDADDY,

JEFFERSON,

HEâ€™S JUST UGLY.


IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. THATâ€™S RIGHT.

HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST WHIT TO RECOGNIZE

THE AWESOME MILITARY POTENTIAL OF THE DROMEDARY.

I WISH YOU WOULD STOP GABBING LIKE A WOMAN.

ITâ€™S MY STORY. LET ME TELL THE BOY.

YES, SIR.

ALL RIGHT,

THIS IS HANNIBAL.

HEâ€™S THE FIRST CAMEL IN THE WHIT CLAN,

NOW, I GOT HIM

WHEN I WAS ACTING AS A SPY

DURING THE YANKEE INVASION.

FOR DAYS, Iâ€™D BEEN WANDERING THE DESERT

WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER.

MY HORSE HAD UP AND DIED OF THIRST,

SO I FILLED MY CANTEEN WITH HER BLOOD TO KEEP MYSELF

FROM SUFFERING THE SAME FATE.

Iâ€™D JUST ABOUT GIVEN UP THE GHOST

WHEN I STUMBLED UPON AN HONEST-TO-GOD MIRACLE...

[men laughing]

CAMELS BROUGHT FROM THE HOLY LAND BY THE YANKS

TO HELP MOVE SUPPLIES.

AND WHEN I SAW HANNIBAL STANDING THERE,

AHHH, I KNEW GOD HISSELF HAD SENT ME THE ANSWER

TO MY PRAYERS.


YAAAA-HOO!

[men screaming and gunshots firing]

AHHHHHHH-HA-HA-HA-HA!


WHOOOOO!

â™ª

YOU SEE,

THE MINUTE I LAID EYES ON THEM CRITTERS,

I KNEW THAT THE CAMEL WAS THE DESERT WARRIORâ€™S STEED.


HOLD YOUR POSITIONS!

[men hooting and laughing]

YANKEES.

HERE WE GO, BOYS.

CHARGE!

YAAAAA!

CHARGE!

COME ON, CAMEL!

CHARGE!

HEY!

LETâ€™S GET THEM, BOY; LETâ€™S GET--

COME ON, YOU, CHARGE; GET THEM, NOW!

COME ON, LETâ€™S GET THEM!

LETâ€™S KILL SOME YANKEE, BOY!

CAPTAIN WHIT.

WHAT?

THE ENEMY IS LAUGHING AT US, SIR.



Iâ€™LL KILL YA!

CHARGE!

COME ON! COME HERE, YOU SONS OF BITCHES!

COME BACK AND FIGHT!

I LOST.

[camel grunting] SHIT.

SHIT! SHIT!

HANNIBAL, DID YOU SEE THAT?

THEY ARE LAUGHING AT US...

LAUGHING. CAPTAIN WHIT.



DONâ€™T YOU SPIT AT ME. YOU SPIT AT ME?


CAPTAIN WHIT. WHAT?

YOU SHOULDNâ€™T REALLY BLAME YOURSELF, SIR.

MAYBE THE CAMEL ISNâ€™T THE DESERT WARRIORâ€™S STEED.

THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DESERT WARRIORâ€™S STEED!

WE JUST HAD A BAD DAY, THATâ€™S ALL.

THE CAMEL CAVALRY DISTINGUISHED ITSELF IN BATTLE,

REPELLING THE NORTHERN ATTACK

WITH ONLY ONE CASUALTY AMONG THE MEN.

AFTER THE WAR, I RAISED

A WHOLE MESS OF CAMELS,

BUT THE AUTOMOBILE KILLED OFF THE CAMEL TRAFFIC IN TEXAS.

ROBERT E. IS THE LAST.

HEâ€™S THE LAST OF THE WHIT DESERT WARRIOR STEEDS.

(Mary Joan) LITTLE SPARTA, YOU WANT TO COME ON IN THE HOUSE NOW?

ITâ€™S TIME FOR SUPPER.

YOU STILL AINâ€™T TALKING, HUH?

WELL, COME ON.

HEY, WHAT DID I SAY, LITTLE MAN?

[chair squeaks]

HEY.

DONâ€™T TELL ME YOUâ€™RE DEAF NOW, TOO.


ITâ€™S RIB-TIME, EVERYBODY.

OH, OKAY.



OH, HERE SHE COMES. OH, MY...

ENJOY â€™EM.

THIS IS THE LAST OF SPARTAâ€™S BARBECUE SAUCE.

WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT?


THE RECIPE WAS IN HIS HEAD,

AND HEâ€™S TAKING THAT TO THE GRAVE, NOW, HASNâ€™T HE?

WELL, NOW, THATâ€™S A GENUINE TRAGEDY. WELL, YES, IT IS.

MAMA, SIT DOWN HERE AND ENJOY YOUR SUPPER.

(Mary Joan) LITTLE SPARTA, YOU HAVE SOME OF THOSE RIBS.

DEAR LORD,

WE THANK THEE

FOR THE JOY THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT US

AND FOR THE WARMTH AND LOVE OF THIS FAMILY REUNION

ON THIS MOST SORROWFUL OCCASION OF OUR LOVED ONEâ€™S DEATH.

WE PRAY THAT GRANDFATHER SPARTA

HAS REACHED HIS REWARD IN HEAVEN

AND THAT HE MAY DWELL THERE WITH YOU IN PEACE FOREVER.




YOU WILL PROTECT US FROM THE CLOUD OF EVIL

THAT HAS DESCENDED UPON THIS PLANET

RAINING ITS DROPS

OF WICKEDNESS TO HARVEST LUCIFERâ€™S CROP,

FEEDING THE INCUBUS OF PESTILENCE

THAT WILL DEVOUR THE EARTH.

AMEN.

AMEN.

A--AMEN. AMEN.

WELL, LETâ€™S EAT THESE RIBS BEFORE SATAN COME IN HERE

AND WOLFS THEM DOWN HISSELF; WHAT DO YOU SAY?

WELL, YOU CAN DENY IT AND PRETEND THAT IT DOESNâ€™T EXIST,

BUT THE WHOLE WORLD, THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE,

IS DESCENDING INTO CHAOS.

OH, CHARLOTTE, I THINK THATâ€™S A LITTLE TOO BLEAK.


I MEAN, WHAT WITH, YOU KNOW,

THE COMMUNISTS TAKING OVER THE ORIENTALS,

AND ALL THE STUDENTS THAT ARE PROTESTING

AND ALL THE MALCOLM Xs.

Iâ€™M SORRY, WALTER.


THAT NEGRO RIGHTS SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND ALL.

ITâ€™S JUST THAT ALL THE MARCHING

AND THE SINGING AND--

ITâ€™S JUST DESTROYING THE COUNTRY FOR THE REST OF US,

AND I JUST THINK THAT ITâ€™S SELFISH.

HMM.

THE WAY THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEHAVING--

AND, YOU KNOW, THEY COULD JUST BE...

ANIMALS IN A ZOO.

(Mary Joan) WELL, YOU KNOW,

I DO HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU, CHARLOTTE,

BECAUSE I FEEL THAT GOOD MORALS

ARE OUT OF FASHION THESE DAYS,

AND THAT THATâ€™S PROBABLY WHY WE HAVE

THIS V.D. GOING AROUND, BECAUSE ITâ€™S GODâ€™S WAY OF--

OF PUNISHING CERTAIN PEOPLE.

THEN LESBIANS MUST BE GODâ€™S CHILDREN, MARY JOAN.

THEY HARDLY EVER SEEM TO GET ANYTHING.


WHAT DID SHE SAY?


THIS PISTOL HERE,

THIS BELONGED TO YOUR GREAT-GREAT-GREAT- GRANDDADDY LUCAS.

THIS IS THE VERY GUN HE USED

TO REPEL THE YANKEE INVASION OF TEXAS.


THIS IS JEFFERSON WHITâ€™S WINCHESTER,

THE VERY GUN HE USED WITH TEDDY ROOSEVELT

AND THE ROUGH RIDERS.

[man screaming]

ONCE, HE WAS CAPTURED AND TORTURED MERCILESSLY

BY THE ENEMY,

BUT OLD JEFFERSON DIDNâ€™T TELL â€™EM A SINGLE SECRET.

TOOK HOME THE SCARS ON HIS FACE TO PROVE IT.

AND THIS IS A LITTLE SOUVENIR

THAT GRANDPA SPARTA BROUGHT BACK FROM W.W. II.

HE WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAD A CAMEL SUPPLY TRAIN

IN NORTH AFRICA, BUT INSTEAD, HE GOT REROUTED...

TO FRANCE.

COME ON, YOU ROTTEN NAZI BASTARDS!

WE AINâ€™T RETREATINâ€™ ANOTHER FOOT!

ISNâ€™T THAT RIGHT, CAESAR? [groans]

THIS IS THE GUN THAT ALL WHIT MEN

LEARN TO SHOOT WITH.

GRANDDADDY LEARNED ON IT.

I LEARNED ON IT,

AND YOUâ€™LL LEARN ON IT, TOO.

GO AHEAD, BOY.

GO AHEAD,

YOU CAN TOUCH IT.

ALL RIGHT, THEN.

[Patsy Clineâ€™s Iâ€™ve Got Your Picture]

â™ª Iâ€™VE GOT YOUR PICTURE â™ª

â™ª THAT YOU GAVE TO ME

â™ª AND ITâ€™S SIGNED WITH LOVE â™ª

â™ª JUST LIKE IT USED TO BE

â™ª THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT

â™ª THE ONLY THING NEW

â™ª Iâ€™VE GOT YOUR PICTURE â™ª

â™ª SHEâ€™S GOT YOU â™ª

â™ª Iâ€™VE GOT THE RECORDS â™ª

â™ª THAT WE USED TO SHARE

â™ª AND THEY STILL SOUND THE SAME â™ª

â™ª AS WHEN YOU WERE HERE

â™ª THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT

â™ª THE ONLY THING NEW

â™ª Iâ€™VE GOT THE RECORDS â™ª

â™ª SHEâ€™S GOT YOU â™ª

â™ª Iâ€™VE GOT YOUR MEMORY â™ª

â™ª OR HAS IT GOT ME

â™ª I REALLY DONâ€™T KNOW BUT I KNOW â™ª

â™ª IT WONâ€™T LET ME BE â™ª


THANK YOU.

WALTER, THEREâ€™S BEEN SOMETHING

Iâ€™VE BEEN MEANING TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

YES?

YOUâ€™RE A BAPTIST; IS THAT RIGHT?

OH, YES--YES, MAâ€™AM, BORN AND RAISED.

THEN YOU MUST BELIEVE IN SIN.

I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS

THAT PEOPLE SHOULD AND SHOULDNâ€™T DO.

THEN YOUâ€™VE GOT TO BELIEVE

THAT GOD PUNISHES US FOR OUR SINS.

MM-HMM.

LET ME ASK YOU THIS, THEN.

BEING A COLLEGE-EDUCATED NEGRO--

YOU CAN TELL ME HONESTLY.

JUST FORGET THAT Iâ€™M A WHITE WOMAN AND ALL,

BUT DO YOU THINK THAT SLAVERY WAS GODâ€™S WAY

OF PUNISHING BLACK PEOPLE FOR SOMETHING?

WALTER?

WALTER. YES?

YOU DO, THEN?

Iâ€™M SORRY. I DO WHAT?

THINK THAT SLAVERY WAS PUNISHMENT

FOR NEGRO SIN.

FOR WHAT SIN?

NEGRO SIN.

NEGRO SIN, MAâ€™AM?

YOU KNOW,

ALL THAT JUNGLE LUST AND EVERYTHING.

â™ª SHEâ€™S GOT YOU â™ª

â™ª Iâ€™VE GOT YOUR MEMORY â™ª

â™ª OR HAS IT GOT ME

â™ª I REALLY DONâ€™T KNOW â™ª

â™ª BUT I KNOW IT WONâ€™T LET-- â™ª

[record scratches]

[clears throat]

PIEâ€™S READY.


ALL THOSE MALCOLM Xs ARE MAKING IT HARD

TO IGNORE YOU SINFUL NEGROES.

I MEAN, ALL THAT MARCHING AND SINGING.

I MEAN, THEY MIGHT AS WELL ALL BE ANIMALS IN A ZOO.

AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOUâ€™RE ALL BORN WITH SYPHILIS.

YOU HUMP LIKE BUNNIES WITH ALL THAT JUNGLE LUST AND ALL.

I MEAN, THATâ€™S WHY GOD MADE Yâ€™ALL SLAVES, WALTER.


NOW, YOU JUST FORGET THAT Iâ€™M A WHITE WOMAN AND ALL--

UNDERSEXED AND NARROW-MINDED AS HELL--

AND Iâ€™LL JUST FORGET THAT YOU GAVE UP YOUR ARM IN THAT WAR

SO I COULD STAY IN MY GODDAMN FALSE EYELASHES

AND LIPSTICK AND HAIRSPRAY.

AND WHILE Iâ€™M AT IT,

Iâ€™LL JUST FORGET THAT YOUâ€™RE GONNA BE A NEGRO DOCTOR.

BEST DAMN DOCTOR IN THE COUNTY, MISS CHARLOTTE.

[tinkling music]

[breathes deeply]

MM.



OH! SPARTA, YOU SCARED ME.

I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO LOOKING FOR YOU.

COME ON IN, SUGARCANE.

YOUR DADDYâ€™S SIDE OF THE FAMILY IS A WHOLE LOT MORE...

UM, COLORFUL THAN YOUR MAMAâ€™S SIDE.

YOU HAVENâ€™T BEEN TOLD TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT, HAVE YOU?

WELL, YOU SHOULD, â€™CAUSE YOU REALLY ARE A WHIT.

YOUâ€™VE GOT ALL THE... FEATURES OF THE...

WHIT MEN.

WELL...

AH, THIS IS YOUR GREAT-GRANDDADDY,

ACHILLES WHIT.

OLD ACHILLES WAS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IN AUSTIN,

AND EVERYBODY KNEW HEâ€™D GO ON TO BE GOVERNOR ONE DAY.

EVERYTHING WAS GOING HIS WAY

UNTIL HIS CAMPAIGN CAME TO HUNTSVILLE.

HOW DO YOU LIKE MY HORSE?



LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

I WILL USE THIS KEY TO THE CITY

TO UNLOCKED THE AWESOME GOD-BLESSED FUTURE OF TEXAS.

[cheers and applause]

GOOD TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU?

MAKE SURE THAT ONE VOTES FOR WHIT.


WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE A GOOD, YOUNG

TEXAS DEMOCRAT.

IS THAT YOUR DOGGIE? [growls]

NOPE. [laughs]


[all screaming]


BUT THAT EVIL DOG HAD RABIES.

THE ELECTION RESULTS CAME IN,

AND YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER WON.

AND THEY CAME TO HIM ON HIS DEATHBED

TO SWEAR HIM IN.

[whispering weakly] I...WILL...

THATâ€™S YOUR GRANDDADDY AND HIS BROTHER, FRANKLIN.

NOW, FRANK IS YOUR SECOND COUSIN CLINTONâ€™S DADDY.

HE AND YOUR GRANDFATHER RAISED CAMELS TOGETHER.

OH,

THATâ€™S OTIS, WALTERâ€™S DADDY.

HE USED TO DO SOME WORK FOR YOUR GRANDFATHER...

[breathing heavily]


UNTIL HE HAD AN ACCIDENT.

IT WASNâ€™T LONG AFTER THAT

BEFORE YOUR GRANDDADDY AND UNCLE FRANK SPLIT THE LAND.

UNCLE FRANK TOOK ALL THAT OLD, USELESS PASTURELAND OUT BACK.

AND WOULDNâ€™T KNOW IT?

A WEEK LATER, HE STRUCK OIL.


TO THIS DAY, NOBODY KNOWS IF FRANK CHEATED SPARTA

OUT OF THAT OIL.

SPARTA NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT, BECAUSE FRANK IS FAMILY.

FAMILY IS FAMILY, SPARTA.

YOUâ€™RE REALLY GOOD WITH THAT.

I HOPE YOU DONâ€™T MIND, BUT Iâ€™VE BEEN ADMIRING

HOW WELL YOUâ€™VE MASTERED YOUR NEW HAND.

WELL, THANK YOU, MIRANDA WHIT.

ITâ€™S LIKE ANYTHING, I GUESS-- PRACTICE AND PATIENCE.


YOUâ€™RE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THAN SOME FOLKS ARE

WITH THEIR REAL HAND.


HOW COME YOU GOT A WHITE MANâ€™S, IF YOU DONâ€™T MIND ME ASKING?

IS THAT WHAT COLOR THAT IS?

[both laugh]

THIS IS--THIS IS ALL THE ARMY HAD LEFT.

OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

OH, THANK YOU.

DID YOU KILL ANYONE IN VIETNAM?

YES, MAâ€™AM.

WHATâ€™D IT FEEL LIKE?


WELL, UH... IT BOTHERED ME AT FIRST.

IT BOTHERED ME A LOT.

THEN I GUESS I KIND OF GOT USED TO IT.

AND HOWâ€™D YOU DO THAT?

WITH, UH--WELL, YOUâ€™RE KIND OF TRAPPED

IN THE SITUATION, YOU KNOW?

YOU CANâ€™T-- WALLED IN.

YEAH, WALLED IN, WALLED IN, ALL RIGHT.

IT TAKES A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT THE WALLS AINâ€™T GONNA MOVE,

BUT SOONER OR LATER, YOU FIND A WAY TO GET ON WITH IT.


WHEW.

YOU AINâ€™T MUCH ON SMALL TALK, ARE YOU?

I SAVE MY SMALL TALK FOR SMALL PEOPLE.


DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE ITâ€™S STILL THERE,

YOU KNOW, WHEN YOUâ€™RE LYING IN YOUR BED

OR WHEN YOU JUST FORGET YOURSELF?

SOMETIMES THE FEELING COMES BACK.

THATâ€™S WHAT I THOUGHT.

I THINK, WHEN YOU LOSE A PART OF YOURSELF LIKE THAT,

SOMETHING STILL STAYS WITH YOU FOREVER.

YEAH, YEAH, I GUESS YOUâ€™RE RIGHT.

YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

WHAT?

YOU SHOULD TAKE ME OUT TO THE PRAIRIE

AND MAKE LOVE TO ME.

[gunshot and glass shattering]

HA!

YOUR TURN.

WANT TO SWITCH RIFLES AGAIN?

NO, I DONâ€™T.

THANK YOU.

I SEE YOU OVER THERE, BOY.

ITâ€™S TIME YOU LEARNED HOW TO FIRE A RIFLE.

COME HERE, SPARTA.

COME ON, LETâ€™S GIVE IT A TRY.

LETâ€™S GO.

ALL RIGHT, THIS WILL BE FUN.

COME ON, GET UP HERE.

ALL RIGHT, FIRST OFF,

GET A GOOD STANCE, LIKE THAT, ALL RIGHT?

NOW, WHENEVER ANYBODY HANDS YOU A GUN,

YOU ALWAYS ASSUME THAT ITâ€™S LOADED.

YOU DONâ€™T PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE TRIGGER

UNTIL YOUâ€™RE READY TO FIRE, OKAY?

NOW, DONâ€™T HOLD HER TOO TIGHT,

OR ELSE SHEâ€™LL SHAKE WHEN YOU GO TO FIRE.

OKAY, AND JUST RELAX.

RELAX, OR ELSE YOUâ€™RE GONNA MISS YOUR TARGET.

OKAY, GET SOMETHING IN YOUR SIGHT.

OPEN YOUR EYES UP.

YOU GOT TO SEE YOUR TARGET.

WHAT IF THAT WAS A DEER

OR A BIRD OR SOMETHING, AND ITâ€™S MOVING?

ALL RIGHT.

NOW, HOLD YOUR BREATH.

OKAY, Iâ€™M GONNA COCK THE GUN FOR YA.

[gun clicks]

AND SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER.

FIRE.

FIRE.

GOD DAMN IT, FIRE.


I JUST DONâ€™T KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG WITH THAT BOY.

WELL...

YOU KNOW HE NEEDS A HUG FROM HIS MOTHER

JUST TO GET THE COURAGE TO BREATHE.

SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE HEâ€™S AFRAID

OF JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.

ALL I WANTED OUT OF THIS LIFE

WAS A SON I COULD TAKE HUNTING AND FISHING.

YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME WE WENT FISHING?

I WENT TO BAIT WITH A LIVE NIGHT CRAWLER,

AND HE UPS AND STARTS SCREAMING AND CRYING,

AND HE BEGS ME NOT TO PUT IT ON A HOOK.

ITâ€™S THERE CORKSCREWING IN MY HAND,

AND HEâ€™S OVER THERE CRYING OVER IT,

CRYING OVER A WORM.

Iâ€™VE LOST A LOT OF SLEEP OVER IT,

AND I STILL CANâ€™T FIGURE OUT

HOW HE GOT SO GODDANG SENSITIVE.

AND I TELL MARY JOAN NOT TO PUT UP WITH IT.

SHEâ€™S BEEN TO THAT WOMANâ€™S COLLEGE,

AND SHE READ ALL THEM CHILD PSYCHOLOGY BOOKS,

SO SHE THINKS SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING.

IT AINâ€™T EVEN LIKE HAVING A SON.

OH, YOUâ€™RE WRONG THERE, ZACH.

YOUâ€™RE WRONG.

HEâ€™S A FINE BOY.

YOU OUGHT TO BE PROUD OF HIM.

HEâ€™LL STRAIGHTEN UP.

HEâ€™LL TURN OUT JUST FINE.

BESIDES, THEREâ€™S MORE TO LIFE THAN BAITING A HOOK

OR SHOOTING A DANG GUN.

NO, BUT ITâ€™S A SYMPTOM.

ITâ€™S A SYMPTOM.

YOU KNOW HOW SHARP LIFEâ€™S TEETH ARE.

I JUST DONâ€™T WANT TO SEE MY BOY EATEN UP, THATâ€™S ALL.



HOP IN.

THAT GUN SCARES YOU, DONâ€™T IT?

BUT THE GUN CANâ€™T SHOOT ITSELF.

SOMEBODYâ€™S GOT TO PULL THE TRIGGER, DONâ€™T THEY?

THEN IT AINâ€™T THE GUN THATâ€™S GOT YOU SCARED, IS IT?

SO WHAT ALL YOU THINK YOU MIGHT DO ABOUT IT?


WHOO.


[crickets chirping]


"MY ESTATE...

"ALL STRUCTURES, FURNITURE, AND ARTICLES THEREIN

GO TO MY WIFE MURTIS."



"TO MY SON, ZACHARY WHIT, I BEQUEATH

"THE AMOUNT OF $15,000,

"WHICH I ASSUME HE WILL USE

TO PURCHASE A CADILLAC AUTOMOBILE."

"MAY HE FINALLY SHUT THE HELL UP ABOUT IT

AND GET ON WITH LIVING."


"TO MY DAUGHTER MIRANDA,

"WHOSE DELICATE NATURE

"HAS REQUIRED INSTITUTIONALIZATION,

"I HAVE SET UP A TRUST OF $15,000

"FOR THE DAY WHEN HER PHYSICIANS

"DEEM HER READY TO REENTER SOCIETY,

"GOD WILLING.

"TO SPARTA,

"MY GRANDSON AND NAMESAKE,

I BEQUEATH MY GUN COLLECTION."

[Zach whispering] HEY, HOW ABOUT THAT?

"MAY HE PROUDLY DISPLAY IT

"AND FOREVER CHERISH THE VALUES

"AND THE PEOPLES IT HELPED TO DEFEND.

"AND FINALLY,

"TO MY NEPHEW CLINTON,

"WHO WAS BORN AND BRED IN THE LUXURY

"OF MY BROTHERâ€™S OIL DYNASTY,

"I DO NOT TRY TO LEAVE ANY MONETARY INHERITANCE,

"WHICH WOULD TRULY SEEM AS INFINITESIMAL AS DROPS THE OCEAN.

"INSTEAD, I BEQUEATH TO HIM

"MY SECRET BARBECUE AND BEEF JERKY RECIPES.

"MAY HE SAVOR THE TASTE AND REMEMBER HIS SUMMERS

VISITING US ON THE FARM."

[Zach whispering] DADâ€™S SAUCE.


"THE LAST OF THE DESERT WARRIOR STEEDS,

"UPON HIS DEATH, RATHER THAN HAVING

"HIS HEAD MOUNTED IN THE BARN WITH HIS ANCESTORS,

"I REQUEST THAT HE BE BURIED IN THE PLOT

SOUTH OF MY GRAVE, THE NORTH BEING RESERVED FOR MURTIS."

THEREâ€™S A CODICIL TO THE WILL.

"TO WALTER FOLEY,

"THE SON OF OTIS FOLEY,

"I BEQUEATH THE ENCLOSED LETTERS

"ENTRUSTED TO MY ATTORNEY,

J.W. CROFT."

THERE YOU GO, WALTER.


ITâ€™S A LETTER FROM THE DEAN

OF MY MEDICAL SCHOOL AT LA GRANGE.

ITâ€™S A...

WELL, IT-- ITâ€™S A FULL SCHOLARSHIP.

AND THEREâ€™S A CHECK HERE, TOO.


"I LEAVE WALTER FOLEY THE SUM OF $10,000,

"SUCH CAPITAL TO BE USED

IN THE ESTABLISHING OF HIS FIRST PRACTICE."

WHY?

WHY IS HE GIVING ALL THIS TO ME?

DOES OLD SPARTA SAY WHY HE GIVES THE BOY THE MONEY?

"IT IS WITH UNSPEAKABLE REMORSE...

"THAT I CONFESS

"TO THE SHOOTING OF HIS FATHER, OTIS FOLEY,

MANY YEARS AGO."

[Otis gasping]


"HAS HAUNTED ME FOR YEARS.

"ALTHOUGH I REALIZE NOTHING CAN EVER MAKE UP

"FOR THE LOSS OF HIS FATHER, I HOPE MY CONTRIBUTION

"TO WALTERâ€™S LIFESAVING PROFESSION...

"WILL HELP TEMPER THE PAIN

AND THE BITTERNESS."

DID HE SAY-- DID HE SAY WHY?

I DONâ€™T BELIEVE IT.

MAMA, HOW COULD DADDY BE A MURDERER?


I THINK Iâ€™LL BE GOING.


(Mary Joan) LITTLE SPARTA.

I JUST DONâ€™T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

NEITHER DO I, ZACH.

MURTIS...

WALTER.

THANK YOU FOR SUPPER.

â™ª

WHOA, WAIT A SECOND.

HANG ON A SECOND, PARTNER.

HEY, HEY, HEY.

I KILLED HIM, â€™CAUSE I THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING

TO STEAL YOUR GRANDMA AWAY FROM ME.


I WAS CAUGHT UP IN AN UNCONTROLLABLE JEALOUS RAGE.

JEALOUSY AINâ€™T GREEN, BOY.

ITâ€™S RED, LIKE A RED-HOT POKER.

YOUâ€™LL UNDERSTAND SOMEDAY WHEN YOU TAKE A WIFE.

WHOA.

[Murtis moaning]

I COULD SUCK IT ALL DAY LONG, OTIS.


WHERE--WHERE ARE YOU? OH, GOD, NO!


BUT NOBODY EVER COME AFTER ME, â€™CAUSE OTIS WAS BLACK,

AND I THINK THEY WERE ALL RELIEVED

I DIDNâ€™T SHOOT YOUR GRANDMA, TOO.

I NEVER LET ANY OF IT BOTHER ME MUCH,

UNTIL A WHILE AGO, WHEN I GOT THIS DREAM.

OTIS?


ON THE BY AND BY, A GLIMPSE OF REDEMPTION

CAME INTO MY SOUL,

I REALIZED THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING I COULD DO

TO BRING OTIS BACK, BUT I COULD SURE HELP HIS SON, WALTER.

YES, SIR, THAT I SURELY COULD DO.

YOU SEE, IF YOU DONâ€™T UNTANGLE

ALL OF THESE LONG, DARK, LOOSE THREADS IN LIFE,

THEYâ€™LL ALL COME TOGETHER

AND FORM A NOOSE AROUND YOUR SOUL AT THE END.



MIRANDA.

YEAH?

GO BACK TO THE HOUSE!

MIRANDA...

MIRANDA, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

[camel groaning]


WALK ME TO MY CAR, ZACH.

ANIMALS HAVE GOT TO WANT TO LIVE.

ROBERT E. IS JUST READY TO--

HEâ€™S READY TO PASS ON.

COME ON, NOW, HONEY.

ITâ€™S ALL RIGHT, REALLY.

DADDYâ€™S GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT.

HONEY?

SPARTA!

[gun clicks]

OH, LORD.

COME ON, SON.

YOU GOT TO GO WITH YOUR MOTHER.

NOW, GO ON.

ROBERT E. IS IN PAIN, SON.

HEâ€™S IN PAIN,

AND WE GOT TO LET HIM GO.

SPARTA,

WEâ€™VE GOT TO RELEASE HIM

AND LET HIM GO TO HEAVEN.

LOOK AT HIM, SPARTA. LOOK AT HIM.


SPARTA, I GOT TO DO IT.

YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO LATER.

BUT I GOT TO PUT HIM--

LATER.


ALL RIGHT, SPARTA, YOU CAN STAY.

THEREâ€™S NO POINT IN YOU GALS STAYING UP.

CLINTON AND I GOT TO BUILD A COFFIN FOR HIM.

ALL RIGHT.

COME ON, LETâ€™S LEAVE THEM ALONE.

GOOD NIGHT, LITTLE MAN.

FUNNY HOW THINGS HAPPEN IN THREES.

WHAT?

THINGS IN LIFE, GOOD AND BAD, JUST SEEM TO COME IN THREES.

FIRST OLD SPARTA DIES.

THEN WE FIND OUT HEâ€™S A MURDERER,

AND NOW, ROBERT E.

YOU KNOW, THREE IS A BIBLICAL NUMBER--

FATHER, SON, HOLY GHOST.

GOSH, I NEVER MUCH NOTICED.

MARY JOAN, DO YOU THINK THAT WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO US,

ITâ€™S BECAUSE GOD IS PUNISHING US

FOR WHAT WEâ€™VE DONE?

WELL, YES, I THINK THEREâ€™S A SCALE OF JUSTICE

IN THE UNIVERSE.

Iâ€™M SO--I OUGHT TO PICK THAT UP.

CHARLOTTE, ITâ€™S JUST AN OLD PLATE.

NO, I WANT-- HONEY, GIVE ME THE PLATE.

I JUST--â€™CAUSE I-- BECAUSE I DROPPED IT.

HONEY, Iâ€™M GONNA TAKE THIS.


CHARLOTTE, WHAT IS IT?

CAN I HELP YOU?


OH, HONEY, WHAT IS IT?

ONLY GOD CAN HELP ME, AND HE WONâ€™T, MARY JOAN.

HE JUST WONâ€™T.

OH, CHARLOTTE, WHAT IS IT?

MARY JOAN, IF I TELL YOU,

YOU GOT TO PROMISE NOT TO TELL.

YOU GOT TO PROMISE.

HONEY, YOU KNOW I WOULDNâ€™T TELL

IF YOU DIDNâ€™T WANT ME TO.

Iâ€™M BARREN.

OH, CHARLOTTE.

Iâ€™M NEVER GONNA HAVE A BABY.

ARE YOU SURE?

WEâ€™VE BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS, BUT NOTHING.

WHAT DO THE DOCTORS SAY?

OH, THEY DONâ€™T KNOW ANYTHING.

IT COULD BE CLINTON. NO.

ITâ€™S ME.

NO, HONEY.

I KNOW ITâ€™S ME.

I KNOW IT.

OH, CHARLOTTE.


COME HERE.

SHH, HONEY.

I MEAN, ALL I HAD TO DO WAS GIVE CLINTON A BOY.

JUST GIVE HIM AN HEIR TO THE COMPANY.

SHH.

NOW HEâ€™S SO DISGUSTED, HE HASNâ€™T TOUCHED ME IN MONTHS.

OH, CHARLOTTE, SHH.

ITâ€™S BECAUSE CLINTONâ€™S DADDY

CHEATED OLD SPARTA OUT OF ALL THAT OIL.

CHARLOTTE, NO. IT IS.

I HAD A DREAM, A DIVINE VISION,

AND IN THIS DREAM, Iâ€™M RIDING A CAMEL

THROUGH THE PLANETS AND THE STARS,

AND Iâ€™M CLUTCHING MY BOY,

MY BEAUTIFUL BABY BOY,

THE BOY Iâ€™M NEVER GONNA HAVE.

AND I LOOK THROUGH THE EYE OF THIS NEEDLE...

AND I SEE ALL THOSE OIL RIGS THAT MADE US SO RICH...

AND I REALIZE I CANâ€™T RIDE MY BABY INTO THE WORLD,

BECAUSE CHRIST HIMSELF SAID YOU CANâ€™T RIDE A CAMEL

THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE.

AND THATâ€™S WHEN I FIGURED IT OUT--

THAT HEâ€™S PUNISHING ME.

AND I KEEP PRAYING,

BUT HE DOESNâ€™T SEEM TO HEAR.

OH, HONEY, YOU JUST KEEP ON PRAYING.

[Murtis sighs]

MURTIS?

YES, DEAR?

HONEY, Iâ€™M HUNTING FOR SOME SLEEPING PILLS.

CHARLOTTE-- SHEâ€™S A LITTLE TENSE.

CERTAINLY, THEREâ€™S A WHOLE BOTTLE

IN THE MEDICINE CABINET.

THANK YOU.

MURTIS, ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

ONLY THING LEFT.

WHAT?

IT WAS ALL JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING.

FOR YEARS, I HAD TRIED

TO FIGHT THE AWESOME POWER OF THE WHIT EAR.



[Murtis moaning]

MURTIS, STOP IT.

GET OFF ME.

FINISH YOUR BREAKFAST. GO ON, SWEETHEART.


I HAD REACHED A POINT OF ABSOLUTE DESPERATION

WHEN THE IDEA CAME TO ME.


TAKE IT; THERE YOU GO.

THERE, THAT-A-BOY.


AND HIS WIFE HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH TO WALTER.

OTIS, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE $20?

[Murtis moaning]

OH, I COULD SUCK IT ALL DAY LONG, OTIS.

YOU CAN SUCK IT AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO, MRS. WHIT.

WHERE--

NO, SPARTA. NO, DONâ€™T!

GET OFF ME.

GET OFF!




[footsteps slowly tapping]


OUT THERE IN THAT FIELD...

SPARTA TROMPED BACK ON UP HERE

AND HE TOOK ME, FORCEFULLY.

NO. NO.

NO. NO.

OHH.

OH, HE JUST GAVE ME THE BEST LOVINâ€™

Iâ€™VE EVER HAD.


YOU KNOW, TO THIS DAY,

I FEEL SHAME WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT...

AND A KIND OF TINGLING.

AND, YOU KNOW, ITâ€™S ALL BECAUSE OF THAT DAMNED WHIT EAR.

YOU KNOW WHAT Iâ€™M TALKING ABOUT.

Iâ€™VE SEEN YOU LOOK AT ZACH THAT WAY SOMETIMES.

I DONâ€™T THINK SO.

YOU DONâ€™T?

WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT?

MURTIS, HONEY,

I THINK IF I, UH...

UNDERSTOOD ANY OF THAT, I--I BELIEVE Iâ€™D BE A PERVERT.

[both moaning]

GOD, DOES THAT RELIEVE STRESS.

YOUâ€™RE THE FIRST WOMAN Iâ€™VE MET THAT...

SMOKES DURING SEX.

WHY WAIT?

YOU REALLY ARE CRAZY, YOU KNOW THAT, MIRANDA WHIT?

YOU BET I AM.

Iâ€™M A BONA FIDE SCHIZOPHRENIC.

GOT ALL MY PAPERS AND SHOTS TO PROVE IT.

WHATâ€™S IT LIKE IN THAT INSTITUTION?

LIKE A MAN WITHOUT A DICK. DULL.

COME ON, DONâ€™T BE FUNNY. Iâ€™M SERIOUS.

WELL, IT AINâ€™T LIKE ANY PLACE OR ANYTHING.

ITâ€™S--

ITâ€™S LIKE-- YOU KNOW THAT FEELING YOU GET SOMETIMES

WHEN YOUâ€™RE SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE COLDEST OCEAN

AND YOUâ€™RE ALL ALONE, SUFFOCATING,

A MILLION POUNDS PUSHINâ€™ ON EVERY SQUARE INCH OF YOUR BODY?

WELL, SOMEONE FOUND A WAY TO TAKE THAT FEELING

AND TURN IT INTO A PLACE, AND THATâ€™S WHAT THAT INSTITUTIONâ€™S LIKE.

[hammer pounding]

OH, I DONâ€™T NEED THAT YET.

YOU COULD BRACE THIS FOR ME, THOUGH.

[clears throat]

AAH! SHIT!

HERE, YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU A BETTER WAY TO THAT?

I KNOW HOW TO DO IT. I KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

EVERYONE KNOWS THE BASIC PRINCIPLES

OF HAMMERING, OKAY?

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT THE NAIL IN,

AND YOU JUST--

SHIT! SHIT! SHIT!

YOU HIT THE GODDAMN NAIL IN A STRAIGHT LINE!

Iâ€™M JUST NO GOOD AT IT.

I GUESS YOU NEVER DID MUCH OF THIS KIND OF WORK GROWING UP, DID YOU?

SURE, I DID.

I WAS BUILDING THINGS ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS A KID.

ITâ€™S JUST, OF COURSE, NOW, WITH THE BUSINESS THE WAY IT IS--

OH, I WASNâ€™T INSINUATING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

ITâ€™S JUST THAT WHEN A GUY GROWS UP IN A WEALTHY FAMILY,

HE USUALLY DOESNâ€™T GET TO DO THE KIND OF THINGS THAT MEN USUALLY DO.

YOU REMEMBER VISITING ME WHEN WE WERE KIDS?

YEAH, AND I REMEMBER PLAYING OLD MAID IN A PARLOR

A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN I DO PLAYING COWBOYS AND INDIANS IN THE WOODS.

NOW, WHY DONâ€™T YOU JUST ADMIT IT, ZACH?

YOUâ€™RE JEALOUS, AND YOUâ€™VE ALWAYS BEEN JEALOUS

EVER SINCE MY DADDY STRUCK OIL ON HIS LAND.

HIS LAND?

WELL, HERE WE GO.

NOW WE SEE IT ALL CLEAR AS DAY.

YOU STILL GOT THAT STUCK IN YOUR CRAW, DONâ€™T YOU?

MY DADDY BOUGHT THAT LAND

FROM OLD SPARTA FAIR AND SQUARE.

AND HE STRUCK OIL ON IT A WEEK LATER.

DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT MAYBE YOUR PA

WAS SO HELL-BENT ON WASTING HIS LIFE

WITH A STUPID DREAM OF A-- A CAMEL DYNASTY

THAT MY DADDY WAS FORCED TO GO OFF ON HIS OWN?!

NOW, MY DADDY TRIED FOR YEARS

TO GET OLD SPARTA TO DRILL FOR OIL,

BUT SPARTA WAS TOO DAMN STUBBORN.

THAT WASNâ€™T THE WAY IT GOT TOLD TO ME.

BESIDES, THAT WASNâ€™T THE POINT.

I WAS JUST COMPARING OUR UPBRINGINGS.

NO, YOU WERENâ€™T. NO, YOU WERENâ€™T.

GOD DAMN IT, YOU WERE CALLINâ€™ ME A SISSY.

THATâ€™S WHAT YOU WERE DOINâ€™.

THE HELL I WAS! THE HELL YOU WERENâ€™T!

MAYBE I DONâ€™T KNOW HOW TO RIDE A HORSE.

MAYBE Iâ€™VE NEVER BEEN IN A REAL FIGHT,

BUT THAT DONâ€™T MAKE ME LESS OF A MAN THAN YOU, ZACH WHIT!

YOU AINâ€™T NEVER BEEN IN A REAL FIGHT?

BY JESUS, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT.

I TELL YOU WHAT, ZACH--

Iâ€™M SORELY TEMPTED RIGHT NOW.

OH, NOW, EASY, NOW, CLINTON.

JUST SETTLE DOWN HERE.

COME ON, Iâ€™M GONNA PROVE IT TO YOU.

WHAT?

COME ON, Iâ€™M GONNA SHOW YOU WHAT I GOT.

COME ON.

LETâ€™S PLAY TOE TICKLER.

TOE TICKLER? YEAH, THATâ€™S RIGHT.

CLINTON, WEâ€™RE GROWN MEN HERE.

NOW, WHY DONâ€™T WE BOTH JUST CALM DOWN

AND FINISH BUILDING THIS COFFIN FOR ROBERT E.?

WELL, I KNEW YOU WAS TOO YELLOW TO DO IT.

ALL RIGHT.

LETâ€™S TICKLE THEM TOES.

[owl hooting]



THERE SHOULD BE ONE MORE,

ONE MORE SMALL GRAVE...

FOR MY BABY.

YOUR BABY?

WELL, IT WASNâ€™T A REAL BABY.

IT WAS KIND OF A BABY-TO-BE.

YOU SEE, HIS FATHER WAS A CHEROKEE BRAVE,

AND DADDY JUST WOULDNâ€™T LET ME MARRY HIM.

HE WOULDNâ€™T HAVE NO HALF-BREED GRANDCHILD OUT OF WEDLOCK,

SO I WENT AND GAVE MYSELF AN ABORTION.

FUNNY, I THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE DADDY HAPPY,

BUT AFTER THAT, HE JUST KIND OF FROZE UP ON ME.

HE PLANTED THAT TREE IN THE BACKYARD

IN THE BABYâ€™S MEMORY.

NOT LONG AFTER THAT--

I COULDNâ€™T TELL YOU HOW LONG--

I FOUND MYSELF IN THE SANITARIUM.

JUST WHEN I THINK Iâ€™M GETTING BETTER,

I GO HOME, I SEE THAT TREE,

AND SUDDENLY, Iâ€™M SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN AGAIN.


SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THAT TREE GOT A HAINT ON IT.


IF I WERE YOU, Iâ€™D...

Iâ€™D CUT THE DANG THING DOWN.

LESS THAN THIS IF YOU WANT TO WIN.


WELL, YOUâ€™RE LUCKY.

ITâ€™S JUST A PIECE OF YOUR TOE, NO STITCHES.

Iâ€™LL SEE IF I CANâ€™T DIG UP A FIRST AID KIT.

TRUNK OF MY CADDY. HERE ARE THE KEYS.

ALL RIGHT, BE BACK IN NO TIME.

YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THIS, CLINTON?


WELL, THIS IS WHERE CHARLOTTE AND I LIVE.

I GOT NOTHING.

WELL, WHAT ABOUT THEM OIL RIGS OUT THERE?

YOU EVER SEE THEM PUMPING?

THE DAMN THINGS DRIED UP ON ME.

I JUST CANâ€™T BELIEVE THIS, CLINTON.


I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING IT MYSELF.

NO SAVINGS?

STOCK MARKET.

LOST EVERYTHING TRYING TO WIN IT BACK.

YOU GOT ENOUGH TO LIVE?

YEAH, WELL,

NOT COUNTING WHAT I LOST TO YOU SHOOTING,

I GOT PROBABLY A WEEK TILL TUESDAY.

WE WERE HOPING OLD SPARTA WOULD, YOU KNOW,

LEAVE US SOMETHING IN HIS WILL, BUT, YOU KNOW,

IT JUST WASNâ€™T MEANT TO BE, SO...

AT LEAST YOU DONâ€™T HAVE ANY KIDS TO FEED.

YEAH, I GUESS WE CAN BE THANKFUL FOR THAT.

I AINâ€™T GONNA TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS, CLINTON,

NOT EVEN MARY JOAN.

WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT, ZACH.

WELL, LETâ€™S WRAP THAT UP AND FINISH THAT COFFIN,

MR. TOE-TICKLING CHAMPION.

COME ON, GIMPY.

IF WE GET DRUNK NOW, WE CAN STILL BE SOBER

IN TIME TO TAKE CARE OF ROBERT E.


[saw scraping]

HEY, DONâ€™T YOU THINK 6:00 IN THE MORNING

IS A LITTLE EARLY FOR PRUNING?

YOU KNOW, CUTTING IT DOWN IS NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING.

YOU MEAN, IT WONâ€™T CHANGE ANYTHING FOR YOU,

BUT FOR ME, ITâ€™S GONNA DO A WORLD OF GOOD.

JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, MARY JOAN,

WHEN ARE YOU GONNA FORGIVE ME?

I CANâ€™T FORGIVE YOU. ONLY GOD CAN DO THAT.

Iâ€™M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BABY.

I WANT TO KNOW WHEN YOUâ€™RE GONNA FORGIVE ME

FOR MY REAL SIN.

YOUâ€™RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

NOW, COME ON IN THE HOUSE AND GET SOME SLEEP.

YOUâ€™VE ALWAYS HATED ME, LONG BEFORE THE ABORTION.

DONâ€™T WASTE OUR TIME DENYING IT.

ALL RIGHT, YOUâ€™RE NOT MY TYPE.

AND WHY IS IT, EXACTLY, YOU THINK THAT IS,

THAT YOU DONâ€™T LIKE ME?

MIRANDA, I DONâ€™T KNOW.

ITâ€™S NOT SOMETHING CONCRETE

THAT I CAN PUT MY FINGER ON RIGHT NOW.

â€™CAUSE I WAS SO PRETTY.

THATâ€™S MY SIN, AND THAT MADE YOU JEALOUS,

â€™CAUSE ALL YOUR LIFE, YOU PLAYED BY THE RULES,

BUT ON A HOT SUMMER NIGHT,

THE BOYS DIDNâ€™T EXACTLY GO LOOKING FOR NICE GIRLS.

WELL, MARY JOAN,

MAYBE IT SEEMS TO YOU THAT I HAVE DANCED WITH THE SERPENT,

THAT I HAVE OFFENDED THE MORAL CODE AND SANCTITY

OF THIS GODFORSAKEN STRETCH OF PRAIRIE,

BUT I HAVE PAID A VERY HIGH PRICE

FOR WHATEVER Iâ€™M SUPPOSED TO HAVE DONE TO Yâ€™ALL,

AND MAYBE THAT AINâ€™T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

MAYBE YOU WANT ME TO TAKE MY LIFE

TO ATONE FOR TAKING THAT INDIAN BOYâ€™S SEED.

WELL, Iâ€™LL LOOK YOU STRAIGHT IN THE EYE,

AND Iâ€™LL TELL YOU I WILL NOT SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE

ROTTING AWAY IN THAT ASYLUM,

WAITING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.

SO THAT TREE IS COMING DOWN,

AND Iâ€™M GONNA PULL OUT ANYTHING BAD

THATâ€™S GROWN IN MY HEART

UNTIL Iâ€™M ABLE TO COME OUT AND START LIVING AGAIN.

YOU GIVE ME THAT SAW.

I DONâ€™T THINK SO.

I SAID GIVE IT TO ME-- YOU GIVE--

OH!

I ONLY GIVE THINGS UP TO BOYS, MARY JOAN, DONâ€™T YOU KNOW?

YOU WANT IT? YOU TAKE IT, OKAY, HONEY?

THESE ARE MY NEW SLIPPERS.

NOW, YOU GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT TO ME.

YOUâ€™RE BEHAVING LIKE A CHILD, AND YOUâ€™RE GONNA GET HURT.

YES, I AM.

MIRANDA, GIVE ME THE SAW.

Iâ€™M LIKE ONE OF THOSE SAVAGES YOU SEE

IN THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.

YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME?

THEN YOUâ€™VE GOT TO DESCEND TO MY PRIMITIVE,

CARNAL, SINFUL LEVEL.

UHH!

AAH!

[both screaming]

OH, LORD.

MIRANDA, MARY JOAN!

OHH! [gasps]





(Mary Joan) MIRANDA, WHAT IS IT?

I DIDNâ€™T HAVE ANY ABORTION.

BUT I ABORTED MY BABY...

IN HERE.

IN HERE, I ABORTED MY BABY.

I PLANNED ON GOING TO THE CITY AND HAVING IT DONE,

ONLY GOD BEAT ME TO IT.

IT JUST FLOWED OUT OF ME.

PART OF ME DIED,

AND IT HURT.

IT HURT LIKE Iâ€™VE NEVER, EVER BEEN HURT.

MIRANDA, WHY WOULD YOU SAY

THAT YOU HAD AN ABORTION WHEN YOU HAD A MISCARRIAGE?

BECAUSE I DIDNâ€™T.

IN MY HEART, I KILLED MY BABY.

THATâ€™S WHY GOD TOOK HIM.

WE CANâ€™T LIE TO GOD.

YOU WOULDNâ€™T UNDERSTAND, MARY JOAN.

YOU JUST WOULDNâ€™T UNDERSTAND.

I TRIED TO HOLD IT.

I JUST KEPT WONDERING IF GOD WAS PUNISHING ME,

PUNISHING ME FOR LOVING THAT BOY,

FOR GIVING HIM ALL THE LOVE I HAD.

HEâ€™S NOT PUNISHING YOU, MIRANDA.

AND IF HE IS, WELL...

THEN HEâ€™S AN ASSHOLE.

OH, LORD. AM I GONNA GO TO HELL FOR SAYING THAT?

ONLY IF GOD REALLY IS AN ASSHOLE, HONEY.


COME ON. 12?

12, MY BUTT.

SWEAR TO GOD.

MY BUTT.

SWEAR TO GOD.

GOD. WELL...

I DIDNâ€™T DO IT UNTIL I WAS 16.

Iâ€™M SORRY FOR YOU.

[both laugh]

WHO WITH?

JENNY.

THE MAID? YES, SIR.

WHEW.

YES, SIR, AND SHE WAS SWEET AS PEACH PIE.

[both laughing]

THERE I WAS.

I WAS ORGANIZING MY SHOE TREE,

AND THEN I--I FELT THIS BIG OLD WET LIP

RIGHT ON MY EAR.

AHH.

AND BOOM, BANG-- I WAS A MAN.

[both laughing]

THAT MUSTâ€™VE BEEN GREAT.

HELL NO. I WAS SCARED TO DEATH.

AND THEN WHEN MY MAN-ROOT GOT SWOLLEN.

[both laughing]

I THOUGHT I HAD TETANUS!


I DIDNâ€™T KNOW WHAT WAS GOINâ€™ ON.

SHE WENT FOR THE EAR, HUH?

ITâ€™S THE DAMNEDEST THING.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

Iâ€™M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING NOW

IN THE STRICTEST OF CONFIDENCES.

OH, OF COURSE. CHARLOTTE IS THE EXACT SAME WAY.

SHEâ€™LL GO RIGHT FOR MY EAR.

ITâ€™S THE GOD DAMNEDEST THING.

OH, Iâ€™M NOT SURPRISED. MARY JOAN, TOO.

YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, DONâ€™T YOU? NO.

DIDNâ€™T YOUR DADDY TELL YOU?

WELL, I GUESS HE DIED TOO SOON.

WELL, I DIDNâ€™T FIND OUT ABOUT IT MYSELF

UNTIL I WAS ABOUT READY TO GO OFF TO BOOT CAMP.

YOU ARE TRULY A MAN NOW, ZACH,

SO ITâ€™S TIME YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE AWESOME POWER

OF THE MALE WHITâ€™S EAR.

SOME CALL IT A BLESSING, SOME CALL IT A CURSE,

BUT THEY ALL AGREE ON ONE THING.

THERE IS SOMETHING TRULY MYSTICAL

ABOUT THE EARS OF THE WHIT MENFOLK

THAT TURNS WOMEN INTO WILD, LUSTFUL CREATURES

WITH NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN THE SATISFACTION

OF THEIR ANIMAL URGES.

NO KIDDING?

TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I DIDNâ€™T BELIEVE IT 100% UNTIL NOW.

THE EAR, HUH?

YEAH.

ITâ€™S NO WONDER MY DADDY WORE A HAT.

GOD DAMN.


CHARLOTTE, PULL!

WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?

LEAN INTO IT.

[all screaming]

[all cheering]


MORNINâ€™.

Yâ€™ALL DOING SOME GARDENING?

OH, JUST CLEARING OUT A LITTLE DEAD WOOD.

A MAN SPENDS THE FIRST HALF OF HIS LIFE

TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WOMEN

AND THE SECOND HALF TRYING TO FORGET WHAT HEâ€™S LEARNED.


WOMEN.

[camel lowing]

HEâ€™S IN PAIN, SON.

HEâ€™S IN PAIN,

AND HE WANTS TO DIE.


WELL, THEREâ€™S ONLY ONE WAY YOU CAN.

YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, DONâ€™T YOU?

LOOK AT ROBERT E.


THE ANSWER IS IN HIS EYES.

â™ª


OH, HONEY, GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE THE FUNERAL.

WHAT IS IT?

ZACH.

IT SEEMS LIKE WE TELL A LOT OF WHITE LIES IN THIS FAMILY.

ONLY THING-- A WHITE LIE CAN TURN MIGHTY BLACK

IF IT SITS IN SOMEONEâ€™S HEAD LONG ENOUGH.

HONEY, WHAT BROUGHT ALL THIS UP?

MARY JOAN,

YOU THINK Iâ€™M FIT TO RUN THIS FAMILY?

BECAUSE ITâ€™S ALL ON ME NOW THAT DADDYâ€™S GONE,

AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.

I THINK THIS FAMILY IS LUCKY

TO HAVE A MAN OF YOUR CHARACTER LOOKING OVER US.

NOW, WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME A THING LIKE THAT?

SOMETIMES...

I GET THE FEELING YOU DONâ€™T THINK TOO MUCH OF ME.

DONâ€™T GET ME WRONG.

I THINK THAT YOU LOVE ME AND ALL.

ITâ€™S JUST THAT SOMETIMES I THINK YOU FIGURED

YOU MARRIED BENEATH YOURSELF, AND YOU DID.

LOOK AT YOU. YOUâ€™RE SO PRETTY.


YOU GOT A COLLEGE EDUCATION.

YOU COULD HAVE DONE BETTER, AND THATâ€™S THE TRUTH.

HONEY, I MARRIED YOU, BECAUSE I SAW A GENUINE HERO,

AND I STILL SEE ONE.

NOW, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING

ABOUT ALL THIS NONSENSE?

MOSTLY SINCE DADDYâ€™S GONE.

ZACH, DID I DO SOMETHING TO MAKE YOU FEEL THIS WAY?

IF WE STAY IN TEXAS...

WEâ€™RE ALWAYS GONNA DRIVE AN OLD CAR,

AND YOUâ€™LL BE BUYING YOUR DRESSES IN THE BASEMENT OF SOME THRIFT STORE,

AND MAYBE IF LITTLE SPARTA DOES START TALKING AGAIN,

I AINâ€™T GONNA BE ABLE TO SEND HIM TO COLLEGE.

HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?


Iâ€™M GONNA TAKE THAT JOB UP NORTH.

WEâ€™RE GONNA MOVE TO NEW YORK.

WELL, HONEY, YOU KNOW WHATEVER DECISIONS YOU HAVE TO MAKE,

Iâ€™M GONNA STAND BEHIND YOU 100%.

REALLY? REALLY, HONEY.




THIS HERE IS YOUR GREAT-GREAT-GREAT- GRANDDADDY, LUCAS.



AND EVERYBODY KNEW HEâ€™D GO ON TO BE GOVERNOR.




THE ANSWER IS IN HIS EYES.


HEY, WAKE UP, BOY.

â™ª

ITâ€™S REAL SAD, I KNOW.

BUT Iâ€™M SO PROUD OF YOU

FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING BY ROBERT E.

CLIMB UP, PARTNER.

LETâ€™S GO FOR A RIDE.

ALL RIGHT.

OH, LOOK AT THAT, BOY.

THIS IS TEXAS.

THIS IS YOUR REAL INHERITANCE.

YOU KNOW WHY TEXAS IS SO DAMN HOT?

BECAUSE SO MANY WHIT MEN CAME HERE

AND RAISED SO MUCH HELL.

MAYBE THATâ€™S WHERE WE MADE A LITTLE MISTAKE, YOU SEE.

INSTEAD OF RAISING SO MUCH HELL ALL THE TIME,

WE SHOULD HAVE REACHED UP AND TRIED TO PULL DOWN

A LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN EVERY NOW AND THEN.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND?


WELL, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.

LIFE IS AN ORNERY CAMEL, LITTLE SPARTA,

AND IT WILL DRAG YOUR SORRY ASS

THROUGH THE MOST GODFORSAKEN DESERTS ON EARTH.

THE TRICK IS TO HOLD ON TIGHT,

AND IF YOU DO THAT, THAT NASTY CRITTER

MIGHT JUST GIVE YOU THE RIDE OF YOUR LIFE.

WELL, THIS PART OF OUR JOURNEY IS COMING TO AN END TOGETHER.

THEREâ€™S JUST ONE LAST THING.

LISTEN UP, NOW.

I WANT MY EAR BACK.

NOW, WAIT A MINUTE! DONâ€™T GET SCARED.

ITâ€™S MY EAR, DAMN IT, AND I WANT IT BACK.

IS IT A DEAL?

COME ON, PARTNER.

THATâ€™S MY BOY.

THANK YOU.

WELL, Iâ€™M ABOUT OUT OF SURPRISES, LITTLE SPARTA.

NOW, JUST REMEMBER, YOUâ€™VE GOT A BURNING DROP

OF EVERY WHIT THATâ€™S EVER LIVED FLOWING IN YOUR VEINS,

AND YOU GOT FIRE IN YOUR HEART.

USE THAT FIRE

TO FORGE ONE HELL OF A WONDERFUL LIFE FOR YOURSELF,

AND EVERY NOW AND THEN, YOU JUST REMEMBER YOUR GRANDPA

WITH A LITTLE PRAYER,

AND Iâ€™LL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU.

HOWâ€™D THAT BE?

LET ME GIVE YOU A KISS GOOD-BYE.


COME ON BACK, SON.

YOUR GRANDMAMAâ€™S FIXING YOU BREAKFAST.

LETâ€™S GO, MAMA!

DADDYâ€™S ABOUT TO ARRIVE ANY SECOND.

ABOUT GAVE UP THE GHOST ON YOU TWO.

WELL, WE OVERSLEPT.

Iâ€™LL BE DARNED.

WAS THAT YOUR GRANDDADDYâ€™S EAR?

WELL, ITâ€™S BACK WHERE IT BELONGS...

THANK GOD.

DANG THING ABOUT DROVE ME CRAZY.

APPRECIATE YOU TAKING MIRANDA BACK.

ITâ€™S MY PLEASURE.

WHERE IN HELL IS SHE?

TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF, MIRANDA.

YOU HEAR? LOOK ME UP WHEN YOU SURFACE.

I CERTAINLY WILL.

BEST OF LUCK TO Yâ€™ALL.

HEY, CLINTON, YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF THAT CADDY.


ZACH.

BE GOOD, WALTER. WILL DO, WILL DO.

BYE!

BYE, Yâ€™ALL. BYE, WALTER.

THAT NEGROâ€™S A PISTOL, AINâ€™T HE?

THAT NEGROâ€™S GONNA BE A DOCTOR.

SOMEDAY HE MAY SAVE YOUR LIFE.

YOU KNOW, THE WORLDâ€™S A-CHANGING, AINâ€™T IT?

COME ON, CLINTON, I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

NOW, YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU,

AND YOU KNOW Iâ€™LL BE THINKINâ€™ ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY.

[baby talk]

NOW, YOU TELL YOUR MAMA AND DADDY

TO COME VISIT ME HERE FOR CHRISTMAS.

â€™CAUSE IF I HAVE TO GO UP TO NEW YORK,

Iâ€™M JUST LIKELY TO FREEZE TO DEATH.

DONâ€™T YOU THINK ITâ€™S TIME YOU STARTED TALKINâ€™ AGAIN?

SEE YOU AROUND.

OH, YOU DONâ€™T HAVE THIS KIND OF MONEY, ZACH.

WELL, THANKS TO THE INHERITANCE, I DO.

WELL, Iâ€™M-- Iâ€™M TRULY TOUCHED, BUT I--

HEY, CLINTON, OIL WELLS MAY DRY UP,

BUT BLOOD IS FOREVER.

NOW, DONâ€™T ARGUE.

WELL, YOU JUST CANâ€™T GIVE THIS KIND OF MONEY AWAY.

WELL, I DIDNâ€™T EXACTLY SAY I WAS GIVING IT TO YOU.


THEREâ€™S, UH...

THEREâ€™S SOMETHING Iâ€™D LIKE TO BUY FROM YOU.

BYE, MURTIS. (Charlotte) BYE-BYE.


â™ª

SUGARBUSH, I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS AND SOME BAD NEWS.

WHAT IS IT?

THE BAD NEWS IS, YOUâ€™RE GONNA HAVE WAIT A WHILE FOR THAT CADILLAC.

HONEY, YOU KNOW I DONâ€™T CARE ABOUT ANY OLD CADILLAC.

HEY.

HEY, HEY, HEY!

YOU GET YOUR LIPS OFF MY EAR RIGHT NOW!

WHATâ€™S GOT INTO YOU, WOMAN? [laughs]

YOUâ€™RE JUST SO CUTE, I CANâ€™T HELP IT.

WELL, I HEARD THAT BEFORE.

OH! YOU DID? WHATâ€™S THE GOOD NEWS, HONEY?

THE GOOD NEWS IS, WEâ€™RE GONNA HAVE

THAT FAMOUS WHIT BARBEQUE TONIGHT.

HELL, WE CAN HAVE IT ANY NIGHT WE WANT.

â€™CAUSE I MADE A DEAL WITH CLINTON.

"HELL"? IS "HELL" A WORD YOU WANT HIM REPEATING?

HE DONâ€™T REPEAT ANYTHING! HEâ€™S A LITTLE MUTE BOY. RIGHT, SPARTA?

THE HELL I AM!

HEY, YOUâ€™RE TALKING AGAIN.

WELL, Iâ€™M GLAD TO SEE THATâ€™S OVER AND DONE WITH,

BUT DONâ€™T YOU EVER LET ME HEAR YOU CURSING AGAIN, OR ELSE Iâ€™LL--

Iâ€™LL STOP IF YOUâ€™LL STOP, DADDY.

WHAT?

WELL, ALL RIGHT,

BUT LETâ€™S SHAKE ON THE DEAL.

WHOA. OH!




YOU CAN THANK YOUR MOTHERâ€™S SIDE OF THE FAMILY FOR THAT.

(Mary Joan) STUBBORN AS HECK? YOUâ€™RE STUBBORN--

HEY, KEEP YOUR HANDS ON THE WHEEL.


LET ME DRIVE.

â™ª

THANK YOU, ROBERT E.

I SURE DIDNâ€™T WANT TO MAKE THIS TRIP ALONE.
