It's not the time
to start playing it safe.

Son, you have to drop.

That's playing to lose.

You got to listen to me.

I've been listening
to you my whole life.

You've got to put
some pressure on.

How can a game

have such an effect
on man's soul?

The way I see it,

how can it not?

You don't choose the game.
It chooses you.

And when it does,

life and golf
become forever connected.

That's how it was
for a young man

named Luke Chisolm.

You've got to be kidding me.

Once you make one mistake
out of the water there,

you just continue
to make the same mistake.

Are you hurt, son?

I'll get over it.

Yeah.

You the guy I saw

putting the flagstick
in the field?

Yeah, and you the guy
that crashed through my fence?

Here. Let me help you.

Johnny Crawford's
the name.

Yeah.
Luke Chisolm.

Yeah, let me see that.

Yeah, look, put
a little pressure on there.

It'll stop the bleeding.

All right.

Yeah.
Thank you.

I need to get you
to my truck

to get you some
medical attention, all right?

So let's get
these clubs up here.

You feel all right?
You're not dizzy?

No, I'll be all right.

You're
a hell of a driver.

373 people?

375.

Megan Monroe
had twins last week.

Yeah. Haven't taken
the sign down yet.

The evening service
is just letting out.

Hey, how you doing?

I went this morning,

in case
you was wondering.

Order up.

Let me guess.
Same as usual.

You got it.

So are you
all done there, darling?

How y'all doing here?
Need more coffee?

Sure.

Oh, Sarah, I could use
some more coffee.

Excuse me.

How you boys
doing here?

You gonna save
a dance for me tonight?

I'll think about it.

She's just playing
hard to get.

Of course she is.

Mama, it's Uncle Johnny.

Hi, everybody.

This here's Luke.

He's had
a small accident,

do we have
that aid kit back there?

I'll get it.

Johnny, what in the world
happened to this poor boy?

Don't worry.
He's gonna live.

Mercy. It looks like
you've been hit by a truck.

More like a cow.

You hit a cow?

No, I missed the cow,

but I did manage
to run through the fence.

Do you need a doctor?

No, ma'am.

I need a mechanic.

Here you go.

Sure.
Thank you.

We need some strong hands

to get the car
over to Brody's shop.

Jake, be a dear
and help Johnny.

What about
my burger?

The poor man's car
just got wrecked,

and you're worrying
about a burger?

Where are your manners?

Come on, Jake.
Let's go. Let's go.

Jake, come on.

Have fun.

Come on, smiley.
You, too.

Work some of that off.

Come on. Come on.

Let's go.

Hmm?
Sarah?

Drive Luke
to the inn.

I'd be much obliged.
Thank you.

Sure.

There you go.

Just let me know
whenever you're ready.

Mama, we'll be right back.

Thank you, ma'am.

Drive careful.

¶ Are you right? ¶

¶ will this end in tears? ¶

where you from?

Waco.

But I've been on the road
these past couple of years.

Yeah? Me, too.

Really?

Mm-hmm.

What for, school?

I'm training to be
a horse whisperer.

I always thought
horse whispering

was only in the movies.

But it's for real, huh?

Yep.

Well, good luck with that.

Thank you.

So where you taking me,
anyway?

Oh, we're just going
to the River Inn.

That's Uncle Johnny's
place.

Are you two related?

No, he's just
a close family friend,

but I've always known
him as Uncle Johnny.

Here we are.

Well, thanks for the ride.

Sure. You have to get
that from the outside.

¶ Feeling it all
as the wind blows ¶

¶ feeling it all
as the time goes ¶

¶ do you feel my eyes
right there on you? ¶

hello?

Don't you even think

about coming in here
with those.

You must be the one
who ran off the road.

What'd you do, fall
asleep at the wheel?

Well, come on.

I don't have all day
to check you in.

Let's go.

And close that door
behind you.

You're not bad looking.

Blind as a bat, maybe.

You married?

The neighbor girl's
looking for a husband.

No, ma'am.
I'm not married.

Okay, now
don't lose this key.

It opens
the front door, too,

so you don't bother me
when you drag in late.

Yes, ma'am.

There's extra towels
in the cupboard there,

but it's okay to use
the same one twice.

Breakfast is at 8:00.

Don't be late.

Hi, there.
Thanks for teeing it up

with us here
on golf central.

I'm Todd Lewis,
sitting beside Frank Nobilo,

and, Frank, we begin with
that unbelievable story

happening at the Callaway
San Antonio open.

Well, that's right,
Todd.

Luke Chisolm is a name

that we've all had
on our radar screens

ever since he won

the Texas state
amateur championship.

Folks, if you have not seen
this highlight before,

sit back and enjoy.

It's something
you will not forget.

The winner of this tournament
earns an exemption

into the Valero Texas open
just a few weeks from now.

Luke Chisolm
had a one shot lead

on the final hole
over Joe Buckner,

father Martin on the bag,

and look who shows up
on the tee:

The number one player
on the planet

and the tournament's
lead sponsor, TKO.

What
an intimidating presence.

Well, that's enough to
rattle anybody's cage,

and in this situation,
Luke Chisolm,

he just blocks
his tee shot way right.

His dad Martin
wanted him...

3- iron.

Whoa.

It's not the time
to start playing it safe.

Yeah, but if I make par,

he's gotta make birdie
to tie me.

You're playing not to lose
instead of playing to win.

Here.

Remember who won
the masters last year?

That guy over there.

Yeah, that guy
over there.

Tko got his fourth
green jacket.

Remember who come in second?

Nobody remembers
the runner-up, Luke.

You can get
on the green in two

if you hit it
with the big stick.

That one hurt.

You wanna hit a few?

Your hand up to it?

Right into trouble.

Thread the needle
with a 3-iron.

You bump and run it
up on the green.

I think I should just
punch out right here.

You got to put
some pressure on.

Hit the 3.

Hit the 3, huh?

Hey, mama, there's
an easter egg hunt

at the church tomorrow.

Sounds like fun.

Can we go, dad?

You got some practicing
to do tomorrow.

Martin,
it's easter Sunday.

Sundays are reserved
for golf.

Son, you have to drop.

That's playing to lose.

You gotta listen to me.

I've been listening
to you my whole life

and this is where
it's got me.

All right. Where
you gonna put it?

I hope he brought
a snorkel.

All right.
Let's see what you got.

You gotta pull yourself
together here, son.

Am I embarrassing you?

You hooked it.

You gotta watch
your right hand.

There you go.

Let it release.

Come on, now.
Let's get started here.

Don't flip it.
Come on, now.

Come on.
One more good one.

In the hole!

Oh!
Oh!

Give me another one.

You're playing not to lose
instead of playing to win.

Nobody remembers
the runner-up, Luke.

God!

You gotta put
some pressure on him.

Hit the 3.

He snaps his putter,
flings the shaft,

and then
the sad shot here,

his father Martin,
walking away from son

on the final hole.
Oh, my goodness.

He ends up shooting
an 80 on the day.

We're going to look
at the one that started

what I believe
was the meltdown

when he hit it
into the hazard

and going forth
from there, Frank.

What was going
through his mind?

Well, I think
he was still smarting,

tom, with the decision
he made off the tee,

whether to hit driver
or 3-wood.

That's obviously still
in the back of his mind.

And once you've made
one mistake out of-

I had a feeling
there was more going on

than meets the eye.

Wow.
He chilled good.

What could I have done
differently instead.

Just hitting never
gets you out of trouble.

The problem is-

what do I got to do to
get some food around here,

kill a cow myself?

So really,
this is farcical.

When you've got
no chance-

wow.

That's no greenskeeper.

"Pga of America
half century club. "

Hey, Luke,
I was hoping you'd be here.

You can tote these.

Well, close your mouth,
sugar. Let's go.

Well, where we going?

Hey, you're looking
a whole lot better.

I'm feeling better.

You're in good hands
with mabel.

I'll tell you what.

I'll feed you right,
but it's my brother Johnny

that you're gonna get
the most from

if you're paying attention.

Now where is
my dance partner?

Sarah?

Sarah?

Maybe you could just
introduce Luke around.

Oh, sure.

Hey, you feeling
any better?

Oh, yeah. It's amazing
what a shower

and some clean clothes
will do.

You good with this,
Duane?

Yeah, go on.

Am I ever gonna get to
see you whisper to a horse?

I don't do that just
in front of anybody, you know.

What about dancing?

You do that
in front of anyone?

Hey, lookee here.
It's tour boy.

Jake rustin,
this is Luke Chisolm.

Yeah, we had
the pleasure

earlier today
at the diner.

Yeah, that was
right before

I helped drag your car
out of a cow Patty.

Wasn't too happy
about it at the time.

Then me and Sarah
saw you on tv, remember?

You're a regular celebrity.

Not every day I get to
help out a record holder.

Hey, Jake, be quiet.

Well, I had
quite the meltdown.

Oh, yeah. I especially
liked that mud bath.

The golf channel,
they don't miss a thing.

Jake.

It's okay.

Just let him talk.

I'm sure he could
have done a lot better.

You play golf?

I can hold my own.

Yeah? On what course?

The kind with windmills,
volcanoes?

Come on, guys.

All right,
can we be social?

Let's play nice.

I never shot 16
on one hole before.

Yeah, well,
it was a 14.

Sarah,
it was a pleasure.

You wanna dance?

¶ Leave it all behind ¶

I didn't see
where it went.

You hooked it.

You gotta watch
your right hand.

Let it release.

Don't flip it.

Dad, it's getting dark.

Well, I can see just fine.

Come on, now. Let's finish
what we started here.

One more good one.

Come on, now.

There you are.

Hey.

Tough day, eh?

Yeah, I've had better.

Yeah, well,
I saw you on tv.

I got to say
it was painful to watch.

Try living it.

Believe it or not,
I have.

I believe it.

I snooped around
in your study.

Yeah? Well, I chased
the tour for a while.

Had my ups and downs.

You want an observation?

You were playing
from back here, see?

Tournament golf has to
be played in front of you

where the target is.

That's a new one.

You have the mechanics.

You just don't know
what it means

to play the game
in front of the ball.

Well, I'm debating

on picking up a club
ever again.

Well, I have
a proposition for you.

Spend seven days
with me in utopia,

you'll find your game.

Seven days?
I don't know.

Well, it'll
take you that long

to get your car fixed,
you know?

So think about it,
all right?

I'll be at the driving range
9:00 A.M. tomorrow morning.

Sarah.

Hey, Johnny.

I thought you could
use some company.

Gonna be
fireworks soon.

All right.

I also wanted to
apologize for Jake.

His dad
basically disowned him

after he chose the rodeo
over the family business.

He's got a warm heart,
that's for sure.

I see.

You two together?

No. Everyone
expects us to be, but...

I don't know,
especially Jake.

So what about you?

Me.

Mom and I lost my dad
to cancer two years ago,

so I suppose
I'm just...

Taking each day
as they come.

I'm sorry.

"I suppose" means God
works in mysterious ways.

Johnny says he can
help me with my game.

Think I should
take him up on his offer?

Well, I think...

I think some time here
might do you good.

"Donations appreciated.
God bless. "

Nice.

You got game, son.

You could have told me
you owned this place.

Well, you could
have told me

what really happened
to your putter.

What made you want to build
a golf course out here?

Well, originally
I moved here

to get away
from the game,

but easier said
than done, I guess.

So you quit the tour?

Well, the game just wasn't a
good fit for me anymore. Yeah.

Okay, listen,
let's get started.

I want to see you
hit some, all right?

I want to see you swing.

These are a little better.

Yep.

Why do you grip
the club that way?

Well, I don't know.

Just feels good.

Well, that's
the wrong answer.

Now, let start from
scratch, all right?

I need to know why you
do the things you do.

Like the foundation
for your swing,

from the grip
to the follow through.

Now go think about it
and write it down.

The first step
in finding a good game

is to find
some conviction.

You got that?

Think about it.

How'd I end up here?

Unbelievable.

The toughest challenge
you'll face

isn't the golf course

or even your
competitor's score.

It's that casual comment

offered by someone,
anyone,

about how you should
be doing it.

If you don't have
conviction

about where
your foundation is,

that off-handed comment will
take you out of your game

and erode
your confidence.

Now, you got that?

Yes, sir.

That's Ben hogan.

Yeah.

The one and only.

Place the club
in my left hand

with my thumb
down the shaft.

Place my right hand
over my left thumb

and my lifeline.

That helps me
cock my wrist

in my backswing.

That's good.

I do believe.

You're not from here,
are you?

Well, not exactly.

I've lived
in a lot of places.

Been around here and there
with the military.

No, I'm not from here.

How'd you end up
in utopia?

You ask a lot of questions,
young fella.

You really do.

I burned all my Bridges.

There was no place to turn
but here.

A tour player like you,

the players
you played with,

why here?

I'll tell you.

Paul Hawkins
was a student of mine

way back when,
that's Sarah's dad.

He was a good man-
a great man.

He let me stay with them
while I...

Got my act together.

Been here ever since.

Did you get
in some kind of trouble?

It's getting late.

I'm gonna see you tomorrow
down by the river.

Day break, all right?

What does the river
have to do with golf?

You'll see.

You will see.

Rhythm, balance, patience.

That's what you need
to stay in your game.

The same with fly fishing.

It takes a calm mindset

a focus on the feel,
rather than the outcome.

It takes emotional control.

Hey?

All right.

Tell me.

What was his downfall?

He took the bait.

Yeah, but why?

What made him
fall into that trap?

I'm not sure.

'Cause he was hungry?

No, he was mad.

I teased him
with a shadow casting,

never quite letting
the fly touch the water,

so I was able
to take that fish

out of his game today.

Now, you ready
to give it a try?

All right, remember.

To stay in balance
in the skiff

or during your golf swing,

you have to control
your emotions.

Okay?

All right.

Breathe, Luke.

Rhythm, balance,
and patience.

Johnny, I got one.

Now catch it.
Keep the tip up.

Keep the tip up.
Take it as it comes.

All right?

Easy. Easy.

Oh!

Never fails.

Got him, Johnny.

Hey, good job, son.

Whoo!

How comes you always seem
to do things the hard way?

Good. Hey!

Come here. I want
to show you something.

30 years ago, this man
named Jack nicklaus

took me out of my game.

You know how?

By staying in his game.

The calmer he was,
the madder I got.

And I tried shots

I wouldn't
ordinarily take.

Now, this look familiar?

A little hiccup on 18.

Well, at least you got beat
by the golden bear.

Yeah, and so
would you have.

Ha ha ha.

Now tomorrow we actually
meet at the course.

Fifth fairway.

8 A.M.

I'm sorry.

It's not good
to be late in life, son.

Time is too precious
to waste.

I said I was sorry.

If this was a tournament,
you'd be disqualified.

Now, you wanna play
like a professional,

you have to act like one,
all right?

Now take a seat.

Take a seat.

Today...

We're gonna paint.

All right?

Paint?

All right.

All golf shots start
with a blank canvas.

We paint the shot
with our eyes first

so our bodies can
reproduce it accurately.

Now...

What kind of shot could
you make from here?

Well, I think-

no, no, don't think.

See.

Okay.

I see a low punch
eight iron.

Playing the ball
back in my stance

with a slightly hooded
clubface.

I can see the ball
flying about 30 yards

with some hook-spin,

landing on the upslope
of that hill,

bouncing up
and going in the cup.

Okay.

Now go paint it.

Morning.

Morning.

Just paying a visit
to Paul.

Yeah.

Mama.

Hey, mama,
you gonna be all right?

Just give me a minute?

Right, honey.
You go have fun.

Take care.

Can't believe
it's been two years.

Yeah.

I miss Paul
most every day.

Yeah. Whoa-ho-ho.

Hi.

Hey.

You look nice.

Well, thank you.

So your Uncle Johnny,

he's a real
piece of work today.

Yeah, well, it's actually

kind of a rough day
for all of us.

It's the second anniversary
of dad's passing.

It's okay.

Is there anything
I can do?

Well, I was gonna ask you...

My father and I
used to go up to obra maestra

on his birthday.

I was thinking of going
out there later today,

and I could
really use the company.

It'd be an honor.

Okay.

I see Uncle Johnny's
got you painting already.

Yeah, he does.
I wasn't expecting that.

Looks like we're gonna
have to add another shelf.

Maybe one day there'll be
tour trophies on that shelf.

Ain't no maybes
in this world, Luke.

You understand?

Yes, dad.

Good.

Now rephrase what
you just said to me.

One day there will be
tour trophies on this shelf.

I'm counting on it, son.

I'm proud of you.

You ready, cowboy?

<i>Obra maestra means
masterpiece in Spanish.</i>

I can see why.

Sure is beautiful.

I might even go as far
as calling it utopia.

Yeah.

I suppose you might.

You ever think of living
somewhere else?

Everything I need's
right here.

I'm free to be myself.

Free to do the things
I was born to do.

What is that?

Bring freedom to horses.

And the occasional stranger.

Come on.

Hyah! Move!

Jake.

Jake, you're coming
too close.

You're gonna scare
the horses.

Come on!

Whoa.

What are you doing
out here with him?

I'm taking a ride.

I didn't know
I needed your permission.

So tour boy, choke
on anything lately?

Yeah, well, at least
I got a sport to choke on.

What do y'all play
out here, mutton busting?

You know what
us tour boys say

about Hicks
and sheep, don't you?

That's real funny.

I don't know who you
think you're talking to.

Boys. Hey, quit it!

Now, you're acting like
a couple of children.

Jake! Chuck, get him off!

You heard the lady.

Get off me!

How about you two hotheads

settle this over a friendly
little game of cowboy poker

after the rodeo tonight?

Ladies and gentlemen,

this is the final event
of the evening.

Hold on to your seats.
It's time for cowboy poker.

Introducing our players:

Duane Clint pickens

and Chuck baer,
the usual suspects.

Four-time utopia
rodeo champion Jake rustin.

And our final player,
he's a first timer,

so let's give
a warm utopia welcome

for professional golfer
Luke Chisolm.

All right, boys,
deal the cards

and let's get
this party started.

Time to put up or shut up.

All right.
What are we playing?

Texas hold 'em.

Yeah, but there's a catch.

You got to hold on
to your chair.

Why?

You'll see.

The last man
still in their seat

wins 200 bucks!

Watch out.
He's got his sights set

on the usual suspects.

Chuck's all in.

Who's cannonball
gonna go for next?

Watch out, slim!

Get your butt
in the chair.

It's you and me.

See what you got.

Boys.

Whoa!

And the winner
is the rookie.

Dang it!

Proud of you, son.

Hey, Luke, Luke,
what's next for you?

Is it time
to go pro?

Well, this hasn't even
sunk in yet,

so I'm just gonna try to
enjoy this feeling and, uh-

he's a humble kid.

What he means to say
is yes.

He will be turning pro.

Of course
he'll be turning pro,

and we'll begin to look

for a sponsor's
exemption immediately.

All right!

Good going, Luke.
Yeah!

I'm sorry.

Yeah, I know.
Laugh it up.

Hey, speaking of manure,

where'd the rhinestone
cowboy go?

I was ready to gloat.

Well, Jake
went off in a huff.

He's doesn't like
to lose.

Well, that makes
two of us.

Well, there's more to life
than winning, right?

Like what?

Family. Friendship.

Faith. Love.

Oh, yeah.

I guess those, too.

Johnny's got the horses
hitched up.

It's time to go.

You know, cowboy?

Sometimes I think you
might just be hopeless.

Luke.

Get in here, smelly.

Come on in here.

I hung up
your masterpiece.

You forgot to sign it.

What's this?

Oh, that?

That bottle's
my greatest trophy.

No, let me explain.

It's the last liquor
I ever drank.

Doesn't it tempt you?

No, just the opposite.

Makes me remember
all the things I lost

because I drank too much.

That's why
I put it there.

Is that why
you quit the tour?

Well, more or less, yes.

More or less, yeah.

Pretty hard
to drink and drive, eh?

Yeah.

Well, I'm sorry
about this morning,

being late and all.

No, no, I'm not.
I am not.

Learn how
to paint your shot,

you learn
how to be on time.

A professional golfer
does both.

Now, sign your masterpiece,
Picasso.

Where we headed, anyway?

Going to work
on your putting.

Well, the golf course
is back that way.

Uh-huh. Yeah, it is.

I thought you said we was
going to work on some putting.

That's right.
That's right.

We are. Come on.

I hope you brought some of
your winnings from last night.

Well played, gentlemen.
Well played.

Hear, hear.
Keep practicing.

Well, look who he
dragged in here with him.

You a little stiff
this morning?

Still sore
I beat you last night.

You better watch it.

Enough of that, Jake,
knock it off.

Hey, Jake,
come on, come on.

Get the washers, all right?

Let's get the game
started here. Come on.

Same old Jake. Come on.

Okay. Now,
the rules are simple.

The man who's up

pitches from behind
the marker of his choice.

Yeah, but I don't see what
this has to do with golf.

You just watch.
Just watch.

Just watch. See?

Ooh! You owe me
five bucks, boys.

You ready
to give it a try?

Yeah, sure.

Come on. Don't make me
look bad, now.

All right, it's on, boys.

There's not a chance
he'll make this.

You gonna put your money
where your mouth is?

You're on.

Ho-ho!

Beginner's luck.

Here. Let's see you
do that again.

All right.
I will.

¶ Everybody
needs a woman's love, now ¶

yes!

I like this game.

Crazy, cowboy.

Hey, knock it in, man.

Oh!

¶ I'm gonna move ¶

¶ I got to work it on out ¶

he's better than you!

¶ Early in the mornin' ¶

¶ I play it for you
more now ¶

¶ bend it on out ¶

whoo!

Yeah! Yeah!

Come on.

Let's go.

We're even.

Come on, slim!

¶ I like it like that ¶
oh, come on!

Yeah!

I'm impressed.

Make me proud, son.

You make me proud.

Watch his form.

Right off the fingers.

I'm the rodeo king!

You know what I love
about the cowboy way?

Everything! Hey!

Whoo!

Okay, boys.
Let's go. Let's go.

We're going
to the links now.

We're gonna do
some putting. Let's go.

Come on.

Come on.

Pitching washers...

Give me an idea
for a putting technique.

You're kidding, right?

No, no, sir.

I have a respect
for tradition,

but I have a passion
for the truth, okay?

Now, here. Jake?

Yes, sir.

Use the face-on
putter.

You use
the traditional one.

5 to 1 on Jake.

Quiet in the peanut
gallery here.

Come on, Jake.
Help me out.

Get in the hole.

Get in the hole!

Yes!

It's gonna be
a good day for me.

Good. Good.

You try.

Come on, rookie.
Make me some money.

Oh!
Oh!

Ooh.

Miss it. Miss it.
No, no, no.

Yes!

I'm impressed.

You ready to give
this one a try?

Here you go.

When in utopia, right?

Come on. Lets go.

More drinks for me
tonight. Let's go.

Ain't no way.

Come on, now.

This look right?

No way. No way.

No-oh, yeah!

Let me ask you
something.

Would you
or could you

use this
in competition?

I'd probably get laughed
off the course,

but it definitely works.

Well, you keep it.

'Cause when
the time comes,

you'll know
when to use it.

Okay.

You have any kids?

No, sir.

That's one of
my biggest regrets.

I saw
your wedding photo.

Oh, you snooping around
again, are you?

You snooping?

You're a super snooper.

I'm sorry.

You're a real snooper.

Well, that's
a cool study room.

Pictures
of all those legends.

No. Annie,
my Annie,

couldn't have kids.

She used to joke that
she didn't need any

'cause she had me.

Yeah.

Well, if you don't
mind me asking,

what happened?

Well, she's gone on.

Couldn't put up with
my drinking anymore.

Can't say I blame her.

Sorry to hear that.

Yeah, well...

Gone but not forgotten.

As they say...

All part of God's plan.

Yeah, I suppose.

Good night.

Night.

I'll see you
in the morning.

You bet.

Let me guess.

This is where
you drop me off

in the middle
of nowhere.

And expect me
to get back home

with the clothes on my back

and two golf tees
in my pocket.

That'd be
way too easy.

That's it.
Wow.

Is this yours?

Yes, she is.

Um... you're not planning

on going up in this
thing though, are you?

Well, why not?

I mean, flying's
a lot like golf.

Eh?

You said fly fishing
was a lot like golf.

Did I say that?

Yeah.

Maybe I did.
You ready?

No way.

What?

I'm keeping my feet
on the ground today.

Oh, yeah?

Whoa. I don't know
about this, Johnny.

Let's turn back.

Your feet control direction
with the rudder.

The stick controls
the wind and pitch.

Now, to turn,
you press one foot

and you turn the wheel
in that direction.

And to go up or down,
push or pull.

Got it?

Okay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Okay. No hands, see?
Like this.

You're doing good.

All right. I'm getting it now.
I'm getting it.

I think I'm getting it.

It's like riding
a horse.

Keep her steady.

Uh-oh. What's...

What? Wait, wait, wait.

What just happened?
What-Johnny?

Hold on. Hold on.

What happened?

We have an emergency.
We have an emergency.

Put the plane down.

Johnny, you take it.
You take it.

You take control
of this aircraft, son.

All right?

I don't know what to do.

Keep the nose down
and level the wings.

Okay.
All right?

All right.

That's good. Good.

How's that?
All right.

We should try to go back,
shouldn't we?

No, we can't get back.

We'll have to find
a place around here.

Come on. Come on.

There's a wheat field.

All right. Good.
You're doing great, son.

Keep your wits
about you, okay?

Level your wings.
You got 500 feet to go.

How about that?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're doing great.

Steady. Steady.

Steady. Bring it in.
Bring it in. Steady.

Keep the wings level.
Keep the wings level.

Okay.

Leveling my wings.

Is this good?
We good?

Great.
You're doing great.

Leveling. Leveling.

Bring it in.
Bring it in.

Coming in. Coming in.

Wait.

Wait. What
happened here?

Goodness me.

The engine turned off.

Did you turn
the engine off?

The engine turned off?

Is this your idea
of a sick joke?

Why are you laughing?

Confidence comes with
being prepared, my son.

As in golf or life
hand in hand.

I'm about
to throw up over here.

You can't play
in a tournament

unless you're ready
for the unexpected

on game day.

It smells delicious.

Mabel's trout's
famous around here.

More famous
than her pies?

Couldn't be
more famous.

As famous, maybe.

But more famous?

For food in a world
where many walk in hunger,

for faith in a world
where many walk in fear,

for friends in a world
where many walk alone,

we give you thanks,
o lord. Amen.

Amen.
Amen.

He definitely
puts the game first.

Reminds me of someone
else I used to know.

That he does.

Hopefully he finds his way
quicker than me.

Hey, there, stranger.

Hey.

So when's the last time
you caught a firefly?

Well, I don't know.

Since I was
a little kid.

Well, that's too long.

Come on.

She has Paul's gift.

She always was
a daddy's girl.

It's okay.

Hey, Sarah.

What?

These ones in here
quit making light.

That's 'cause they know
they're trapped.

It makes
their lights go out.

Watch this.

Freedom's
a powerful force.

Not yet.

I'm sorry.

No, I-

it doesn't mean never.

It's gonna...
It's gonna rain.

Ready for today's lesson?

I can only imagine

what you got in store
for me today.

Yes, sir.
Today we play golf.

Good. What should I hit,
a driver?

No, no, no, no.

Today we visit
the history of the game

and its future.

You're gonna be playing
with hickory sticks

and a face-on putter.

Ooh.

Not bad.

Perfect.

S.F.T.

One for you.

See it. Feel it.

Trust it.

Little butter cut
over that left tree.

How far?

About 310.

210.

What's
the course record?

Well, you ever shot a 59?

You keep playing this way,
you just might.

Weather permitting,
of course.

Yes, sir.
Boom.

Not sure we can
get this round in.

There ain't nothing
stopping me.

I'm seeing it,
feeling it,

and trusting it.

It's time
to wrap it up, son.

It's not the time
to start playing it safe.

We got one more hole.

No, no, no.
59 doesn't matter, Luke.

It's matters to me.

That's not the lesson.

That was never the lesson.

You spent the whole week

teaching me how to play
the best golf of my life.

Now I'm playing it.

All right. Well, you don't have
to prove anything to me, Luke,

because I'm not your father.

You don't know anything
about my dad, so back off.

No, you can't spend
your life

trying to validate yourself
with a golf score.

Well, how
would you know?

It looks to me like
you quit on your dream,

living out here on this
God forsaken goat ranch.

And this
is your dream today?

This? This is your dream?

You can lead
a horse to water,

but you can't make him drink.

I'm sorry, Johnny.

I forgive you, son.

Whose grave you digging?

You'll soon see.

What's yours gonna say?

Mine?

Yeah, your epitaph,
your headstone.

What do you want people
to say about you

when you're gone, huh?

Maybe it'll say
you shot a 59.

Huh?

I never thought of it
like that.

Maybe we'll just
leave it blank for now.

No. I mean...

I'd want it to say...

Something.

It will.

But I don't think
that your coming here...

Was an accident.

But only you can decide

what to do
from here on out,

'cause, I mean,

there's nothing more
I can teach you, son.

Thank you, Johnny.

No, don't thank me.

Thank him.

'Cause God is all around us.

Inside of each of us,
if you listen...

There's a still small voice
of truth

leading us...

Talking to us,

and telling you

that you...

Can see God's face...

Feel his presence...

Trust his love.

Yeah.

S.F.T.

Huh?

S.F.T.

God bless you.

Happy easter.

Luke, inside this box

is a pencil
and two pieces of paper.

One is for writing down
all the truths you learned

during your time
here in utopia.

The truth that life is about
faith, relationships,

character, and integrity.

That God has a purpose
and calling for you

that is much deeper

than a little white ball
falling into the cup.

These truths will become
your new heartbeat,

the foundation
of your new life.

The other piece of paper

is for writing down
all the lies

you've been told
during your life.

Lies like your golf score

being a reflection
of your true identity

and self-worth,

or that failure in golf

is failure in life.

Take the truths with you,

but bury the lies
right here, right now.

Once you have buried
your lies,

chisel your living epitaph.

¶ Today I found myself ¶

¶ after searching
all these years ¶

¶ and the man that I saw ¶

¶ he wasn't at all ¶

¶ who I thought he'd be ¶

¶ I was lost
when you found me here ¶

all ready to go,
are we?

Yeah, I think so.

Don't think.

See, feel, trust.

Yeah.

Now, before you leave,

I have something
for you.

I have something here.

Well, you've given me more
than I can repay, sir.

Well, gifts aren't meant
to be repaid.

They're meant
to be passed along.

Look at this.

That was
my last tournament.

You notice anything?

Huh?

Well, you're not on
the leaderboard.

Yeah, that, but no.
Look again. Look again.

Look.

Oh, it's the Texas open.

Right.

That's this weekend.

Yeah. The tournament's
main sponsor

is an old friend.

He says
as a personal favor

he'll offer you one
of his free exemptions.

All right?

Huh?

Man.

I don't...

I don't know what to say.

Well, I think,
between you and me,

it's all about
the ratings.

He's probably hoping
you have another meltdown,

and I'm hoping that
you can prove him wrong.

Yeah.

Well, you can count on it.

Oh, yeah.

Now, don't go running over
any of them cows,

because I don't want you
to ruin my pie.

Well, don't worry.

I can see
a little better now.

Yeah, you can.

Okay. God bless you, son.

God bless you.

Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

I'm gonna miss
y'all, too.

Thank you so much
for everything.

You bet.

Got you a little gift.

Just keep the lid off it

and you can come visit
whenever you want.

Well...

Till next time, then.

Next time.

You need any more
putting lessons,

you just let me know.

Hey, tour boy.

Well, if you need
some lessons

on some cowboy poker,

well, you're just gonna have
to figure it out yourself.

Johnny.

Yeah.

Thank you for everything.

No, I wanna thank you
for everything.

I really do.

Yeah.

And, son, I do believe.

Okay?

Yes, sir.

God bless you.

Thank you.

Let's get you
something to eat.

Yes, mom.

Hey, bud.

I got you
a little present.

Callaway's latest
and greatest.

Thanks, dad.

Luke, uh...

My actions last week...

Were wrong.

I pushed you your whole
life to succeed at golf,

and I never once asked

if that's what
you wanted.

I'm sorry for that.

Well, I forgive you.

I only want
what's best for you.

I know.

I love you, dad.

I love you, too, son.

Well...

Ain't looked at mine
in a while.

Might be overdue.

Good night, son.

Welcome home.

Hey, dad.

Yeah?

I almost forgot.

You wanna caddy for me
this week in the Texas open?

Welcome, everyone,

to the pride
of the lone star state,

the Valero Texas open.

I'm Kelly Tilghman

with pga tour winner
Brandel Chamblee.

A compelling story
this week, Brandel,

was the sponsor invite,
Luke Chisolm.

How does one go

from oblivion
to center stage?

This man knows, Kelly.

In his first
pga tour event,

he has a chance
for redemption.

Now on the first tee,

from waco, Texas,
Luke Chisolm.

Round two and three

saw heated action
atop the leaderboard.

Some of golf's
biggest names

pining for the lead.

Rich beem, Stewart Cink,

TKO, and Ricky Fowler.

Come on, TKO!

This pressure-filled Sunday

at the Texas open

offers an abundance
of characters.

Stewart Cink, four time
masters champ TKO,

and we have a local talent
with fresh wounds.

The surprise performance

coming from Luke Chisolm,
just two weeks removed

from that
complete meltdown

at the lone star event
in San Antonio.

And now, he finds
himself chasing,

of all people, TKO,
atop the leaderboard.

And, Kelly, you really
couldn't script it

any better than this.

No. No, you can't Brandel.

We've seen
cinderella stories before,

but we've also seen

what TKO has done
to those glass slippers.

He has crushed them.

And we pick up
with Luke Chisolm

now on the 10th tee.

Let's hit 3-wood.

Fairway's
a little tight.

Chisolm
playing it safe here

with the 3-wood on
this very reachable par 5.

That's okay,
Luke.

And that shot
will very likely

put some demons
in his head.

It was a shot almost
identical to that

that started
his monumental blowup

a few weeks ago.

Luke's gonna have
to conquer those demons

if he wants to win,

and that's one of the toughest
things to do in golf.

Well, what you want
to do, son?

Go back to the tee.

Head up, Luke.

Well, it's gonna be
one heck of a par, dad.

Oh, you got it.

Having taken an unplayable
lie on his first drive,

Chisolm is now back
on the tee

hitting his third shot.

Looks like he's going

with the driver
this time, Brandel.

And Kelly,
I don't know why

he didn't use driver
the first go around.

He hasn't sniffed
missing a tee shot

all week long with that
callaway octane driver.

Perfect!

Exactly as he has
all week long.

See you
in the clubhouse, boys.

Y'all play well.

A par after
taking an unplayable

could be a turning point
for Chisolm.

This Sunday has given us
a great leaderboard.

Rich beem capable
of a big charge,

question marks
surrounding Luke Chisolm,

and TKO as intimidating
as ever.

But it looks like we're
winding down to just two.

A classic
David and Goliath story

between Chisolm and TKO.

Chisolm from 12 feet...

And he sinks it!

Luke Chisolm
just one back of TKO.

You know he's licking
his chops right here,

not only to make birdie,

but to put the pressure
on TKO

to do the same
and avoid a playoff.

Remember, TKO
eagled this hole yesterday.

And now Luke Chisolm
with his second shot

to this par 4 on the 18th hole.

Yeah!

The pressure
is really on TKO now.

He has no choice
but to go for the green.

This one's looking good,
Brandel.

It's on the green
with a chance at eagle.

He makes it look easy,
doesn't he, Kelly?

What an answer
by the steely veteran TKO,

who drove the green.

If he makes this
eagle putt, he wins.

And how's this
for excitement?

Tko and Chisolm
are headed to a playoff,

both men tied at 16 under.

And TKO has the
upper hand once again.

He's never been
defeated in a playoff

on the pga tour,

and Luke Chisolm, his
first taste in extra holes.

They're going back
to the 18th tee,

where anything can happen.

Tko and Luke Chisolm
are about to tee off

on one of the greatest
risk/reward holes

in all of golf.

And earlier,
Brandel had a chance

to take a closer look at this
tremendous finishing hole.

The finishing hole here
is a great one.

A drivable par 4
of 355 yards

that plays downhill

and gives the players
a lot of choices.

But those choices
come with risks.

The green is protected
by a tree and a bunker

and a treacherous
water hazard.

The green itself
is very narrow and fast,

with a lot of slope in it.

And a two-putt
from above the hole

is highly unlikely.

But one of the worst places

that a player
could drive the ball

would be long
and to the left

in that area there,

because an up and down
would be almost impossible.

And his pitch shot

would most likely run off
the front of the green.

And there
you have it, folks.

This hole provides
the perfect stage

for the drama
that's about to unfold.

Well, no surprise
here, folks,

that TKO has taken
driver out.

Obviously trying
to make an eagle

and win this thing
outright.

But in doing so, he brings
double bogey into play.

Tko lives
for moments like this.

And TKO is one
of perhaps just 10 players

who can drive this green.

We saw him do it just
moments ago in regulation.

Oh, it sounds like
he crushed that one.

Yeah, it's
a good looking swing.

Always in balance.

It took off
on the right line.

But there's more wind now
than there was earlier.

He's getting more help,

and with his
high ball flight,

carrying that creek
should not be a problem,

but holding this green
will be.

Oh, look at this.

This could be
serious trouble.

That's the danger zone
Brandel was just describing.

Luke Chisolm going with
the conservative play,

iron off the tee.

No surprise
there, Kelly.

He's stuck to that
game plan all week,

and with
only one exception

has he strayed
from the fairway.

He's looking
to put this ball

in a spot where he
gets the right number,

gets a wedge
in his hand,

and he can put
the pressure on TKO.

Luke seems relaxed.

Is this the same player
from two weeks ago?

No, it's not
the same player.

He may have
the same swing,

but a completely
different outlook.

What do we got?

75 yards?

Just like in regulation.

Yeah.

Lob wedge.

Thank you.

This is the same shot

he had
just a few moments ago,

however, the situation
is entirely different.

He knows
that given TKO's lie,

he could win
this tournament.

Whereas
a few moments ago,

he was chasing.

See it.

Feel it.

And trust.

Not quite like
his holeout in regulation,

but under the circumstances,
a very solid shot.

If TKO was looking
for a gift

from an
inexperienced Luke,

he didn't get it.

Tko has a nearly
impossible pitch.

He's looking
at a tight flag,

the green
is running away from him,

not to mention the water.

Anything short
of hitting that flagstick

and he's probably
going swimming.

Plain and simple
here, Kelly.

He needs to play
away from the hole.

It's a pretty safe bet

that's going to have
a longer birdie putt

than Luke's 8 footer.

The ultimate test for TKO,

but I wouldn't
put it past him.

He's done it before.

Look at him
sizing this up.

It almost looks like-

and he is, I think,

gonna go
right at this hole.

This absolutely
makes no sense to me.

If he doesn't hole this,

it's very likely
that this ball's

gonna run
off of the green.

This would really
be something.

And he's got to aim
right for the flagstick.

Anything short
of perfect here,

he's looking
at bogie at best.

That's if he's lucky enough
to avoid the water.

The only way
to pull this shot off

on that line
is with a lot of speed

a lot of spin,

and he has to
land it in an area

about as big
as a dinner plate.

And it looks good.

It's got a chance.

Remarkable!

He's unlucky, Kelly,

that that ball
didn't go in,

but lucky that
it stayed on the green

and gave him about a
15-foot putt up the hill,

and maybe he can put
the pressure on Luke.

And look at him.
He's not even phased.

This is a makeable putt
for TKO.

Is this where
experience pays off?

Generally speaking,
first in

in a playoff wins.

And if he makes this,
I promise you,

that hole will look
a lot smaller to Luke.

How many times has TKO
been in this exact spot

and emerged victorious?

It's that mental edge

that makes him the great
player that he is.

He thought he had that one.

Tko's tee shot

left him
with a lot of stress.

His second shot left him
with a lot of work.

And now it's Luke
who has the work to do.

And TKO no longer
has control

of his own fate.

That control lies
with Luke Chisolm.

It was a great par

for TKO
just to stay in it.

But now
the door is open

for Luke Chisolm
to win the Texas open.

One can only imagine
what's going on

in the mind of
Luke Chisolm right now.

Two weeks ago
his career was over,

and now
he is one putt away

from taking
the Texas open

and beating
the best player in golf

in the process.

Luke knew this putt
was meaningless

in the big picture.

He was now answering
to a higher calling.

It was time to go to a place
beyond tradition,

to a place of buried lies

and unearthed truths.

A revolution had begun
within Luke's soul.

He had a purpose
and a calling

that went beyond
any scoreboard.

He saw, felt, trusted,

and stroked
the putt of his life.

Utopia is defined as a place
of mythical perfection,

but I knew differently.

Utopia is indeed real.

It's a place where
the voice of truth resides

and eternal trophies
line the shelves.

A place where
there are no accidents.

I guess
you're asking yourselves

whether or not
he made the putt.

The better question is,

does it really matter?

How can a game
have such an effect

on a man's soul?
