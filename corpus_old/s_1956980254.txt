UM... BECAUSE HIS FAMILY
NEVER CAME TO VISIT HIM,

HE'S JUST NEVER LEFT.

HE HAUNTS THE PLACE.

THERE'S JUST NO SPACE.

WELL, I PACK LIGHT.

OH, GOD,
I REMEMBER THAT.

LIVING OUT OF
A SUITCASE...

YOUR DAD...

WE HAD TO TRAVEL THE WORLD

TRAVELING ALL AROUND.

I'M GLAD THOSE DAYS
ARE OVER.

I-- WHAT
I REALLY MEAN IS...

I HOPE YOU GOT MY LETTERS.

YEAH, I DID.

CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THIS?

OH...

I'M THINKING THAT
THE BEST WAY TO KIND

WELL, THIS IS BOBBY.

BOBBY?
YES.

OKAY, HAND HIM OVER, HONEY,
IT'S GETTING LATE.

WHY?
HONEY, HE'S FILTHY.

YES, BUT HE'S NOT FILTHY
ON THE INSIDE.

I DON'T CARE WHAT HE IS
ON THE INSIDE, HONEY.

I'M NOT ABOUT
TO ARGUE WITH YOU, OKAY.

IT'S TOO LATE.

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ASLEEP BY NOW.

WELL, WHY WERE YOU MAD
AT DINNER TONIGHT?

I WASN'T MAD AT DINNER.
WHY ARE YOU EVEN SAYING THAT?

WELL, YOU WEREN'T HAPPY.

AND WHO IS THE LORD
AND WHO IS CARRIE TALKING TO?

OKAY.
IT'S NOT THAT I WAS MAD.

CARRIE JUST DOES THINGS A LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY TO HOW WE DO,

AND I DON'T REALLY LIKE IT.

EVERYTHING ELSE WE CAN TALK
ABOUT TOMORROW.

DEAL?

DEAL?

I DON'T THINK WE CAN
TALK ABOUT IT TOMORROW.
OKAY, HAND OVER THE DOLL.

NO, WAIT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

TIA.

OF COURSE TIA FOUND IT,
AND SHE WANTED TO SLEEP WITH IT,

WHICH THAT WASN'T HAPPENING,
SO, I HID IT.

LOOK! I GET IT.
I'M SO SORRY.

THIS HAS BEEN A BIG OLD
MISUNDERSTANDING.
YOU NEVER CAN TELL.

LOOK!
I-- YOU KNOW, TOTALLY.

SO, UM... I WAS JUST RUNNING
OUT THE DOOR TO GET HER.

I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO
MAKE A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION

AS A NEW FAMILY,
AND I JUST DON'T WANT

TO SEE YOU LADIES
JUDGED TOO HARSHLY.

YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE LINES
TO CROSS ALREADY,

IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
YOU LOOK NICE.

FORGET ABOUT TODAY?

IT WAS AN INNOCENT MISTAKE.

I MEAN,
I'M NOT GOING TO EXCUSE IT.

BUT HOW MANY TIMES
DID YOUR MOTHER LEAVE YOU

AT THE PLAYGROUND
15 MINUTES TOO LATE.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME
RIGHT NOW?

COME ON, SAM,

WE HAVE A BIG MEETING TODAY.

I KNOW WE HAVE A BIG MEETING.

I'M JUST TELLING YOU

I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
LEAVING TIA WITH HER.

[ sighs ]

IT'S GONNA--

SHE'S VERY RESPONSIBLE.

SO I SEE,
AS SHE'S SHOWN.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

LOOK, I DON'T THINK THAT GOING
AWAY FOR JUST 12 HOURS

IS GOING TO MAKE
A BIG DIFFERENCE.

NOW, PLEASE!

WE HAVE TO START FOCUSING ON
WHAT IS IMPORTANT.

WE'RE NOT EVEN GONNA HAVE TO
STAY IN THIS HOUSE--

KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!
SHUSH!

I'M LETTING YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE.

Heather: COME ON IN.

HEY, CARRIE.

SAMANTHA AND MOM,

SO THIS USED TO BE HIS HOUSE?

IT'S NICE.
IT'S COLD UP HERE.

SHH!

IF YOU CRAWLED UP HERE.

ACCESS?
ACCESS TO WHAT, CARRIE?

WHAT ARE WE--
WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO?

THE SOUND.
YEAH, I HEAR IT.

I THINK THIS HOUSE IS HAUNTED BY
THE OLD MAN'S SPIRIT

OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

I KNOW IT'S SOUNDING
REALLY WEIRD.

CARRIE, CARRIE,
YOU'RE SOUNDING CRAZY.

NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT JUST THE BIBLE

OR THE PICTURE DOWNSTAIRS.

IT'S A LOT
OF OTHER STUFF, TOO,

LIKE THE TV KEEPS GOING
ON AND OFF

AND THEN THIS GLASS
SHATTERED RIGHT IN MY FACE,

LIKE IT DIDN'T
EVEN JUST FLY--

OKAY, OKAY, OKAY--
IT FLEW INTO MY FACE
AND IT SHATTERED...

AND THE MAN'S PORTRAIT
AND THIS BIBLE!

SHH, SHH--

JUST TRY TO CALM DOWN,

OH, OKAY, I'M SORRY.

OKAY... I JUST.

MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO.

REALLY? I MEAN,
I WILL, IF YOU WANT.

HOW ABOUT YOU JUST... HERE,
COME HERE, SIT DOWN.

PLEASE JUST... JUST RELAX
FOR LIKE THREE MINUTES.

IF YOU WANT ME TO GO,
STILL, I WILL LEAVE.

YOU'RE SO TENSE.
HERE, I HOPE IT'S OKAY,

I SORT OF SHOWED MYSELF
AROUND THE KITCHEN.

IT TOOK ME FOREVER
TO FIND THAT OPENER,

BUT... I COULDN'T FIND
WINE GLASSES EITHER,

SO... THERE'S OUR
ELEGANT OPTION.

I HOPE IT'S OKAY.

PLEASE, CHEERS.
JUST RELAX.

TO... UNWINDING A LITTLE BIT.

[ low humming ]

DID YOU HEAR THAT?
YEAH, YEAH, I HEAR IT, YEAH.

OH, YOU ARE REALLY
UN-UNNERVED BY THIS,

AREN'T YOU?

ALL RIGHT.

UM, DON'T JUDGE ME.

I ALSO HELPED MYSELF
TO A LAPTOP...

[ clears throat ]

DID A LITTLE GOOGLE SEARCH.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

AN EXORCISM?

THAT SOUNDS...
AARON.

LIKE A BIT MUCH.

IT'S NOT REALLY AN EXORCISM,

IT'S... OKAY,
IT'S AN EXORCISM, SORT OF.

BUT, LOOK,
IT... THIS WEBSITE SAYS

IT'S SANCTIONED
BY THE CHURCH.

IT'S JUST... WE LIGHT
SOME CANDLES,

WE SAY A PRAYER...

AND... LOOK, I MEAN--

SO IT'S JUST LIKE
A PRAYER?

YEAH,
WE JUST... WE RECITE THIS,

WE DO WHAT IT SAYS...

AND UM... WE GET THE DEVIL
OUT OF YOUR HEATER.

LOOK, I SAW HOW SCARED
YOU WERE EARLIER.

AND IF YOU WILL FEEL
MORE SAFE IN THIS HOUSE,

I'LL BE HAPPY TO DO THIS
WITH YOU.

THIS IS ACTUALLY
A VERY DETAILED DIAGRAM.

IT SAYS USUALLY
WHEN A PERSON DIES,

THE SPIRIT WILL REALIZE
WHAT'S HAPPENED

AND MOVE ON IN
THE AFTERLIFE.

EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

THE SPIRIT DOESN'T KNOW
THAT HE'S DEAD

AND HE'S TRAPPED IN
A CERTAIN LOCATION.

SO SHOULD I JUST PUT HIM
WITH THE PICTURES?

UH, PUT THE OTHER CANDLES UP
THERE UNDER MR. CREEPY FACE.

SORRY.

HERE, LET'S JUST
PUT IT OVER HERE.

YEAH.

IT SAYS ONLY BY PRAYING

WILL YOU ALERT THE SPIRIT
THAT IT IS INDEED DEAD

AND IT MUST MOVE ON.

SAGE.
YEAH, SAGE.

WE HAVE SOME ACTUALLY.

WOW!

WOW!
DON'T ASK.

THAT'S AWESOME.

OOF!

UM, WE MIGHT NEED LIKE A
LITTLE PLATE OR SOMETHING...
OH, YEAH.

SO WE DON'T BURN
THE BOOKCASE.

OKAY.
AWESOME.

UM...
HOLY WATER.

YEAH, HOLY WATER.

SOME SPIRITS
WILL REFUSE TO LEAVE

EVEN AFTER THEY LEARN
OF THEIR OWN DEATH.

USUALLY THIS IS CAUSED BY SOME
KIND OF EMOTIONAL TRAUMA.

THIS NEGATIVE EMOTION
CAN FESTER,

STRIPPING THE SPIRIT
OF ANY HUMANITY

LEAVING ONLY
AN ANGRY ENTITY.

GREAT, THAT'S GREAT.

GOT THE HOLY WATER.

ARIGHT, GOOD.

I'VE GOT OUR JESUS JUICE.

SORRY.

UM...

THAT'S A COOL BOTTLE.

YEAH,
MY DAD GOT IT AT THE VATICAN.

ALL RIGHT...

WELL, HERE WE GO.

ARE YOU READY?

ALL RIGHT,
IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS,

I THINK WE SHOULD TRY AND BE
KIND OF LIKE SERIOUS ABOUT IT,

AND EVEN WHEN WE LIGHT
THE GIANT DOOBIE.

JUST... LIGHT
THE CANDLES, OKAY.

OKAY.
CAN WE START THIS?

ALL RIGHT!
SORRY...

IN THE NAME
OF THE FATHER...

AND THE SON...

AND THE HOLY SPIRIT...

Together: AMEN.

"IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST,
OUR GOD AND LORD

STRENGTHENED BY
THE INTERCESSION

OF THE IMMACULATE
VIRGIN MARY, MOTHER OF GOD

OF BLESSED MICHAEL,
THE ARCHANGEL,

OF THE BLESSED APOSTLES
PETER AND PAUL

AND ALL THE SAINTS,

AND POWERFUL IN THE HOLY
AUTHORITY OF OUR MINISTRY,

WE CONFIDENTLY UNDERTAKE
TO REPULSE THE ATTACKS

AND DECEITS
OF THE DEVIL."

YEAH, SAGE.

GOD...
GO! COME ON!

OKAY, IT SAYS TO WAIT
FOR THE SMOKE.

IT SAYS WAIT FOR THE SMOKE.

GOD ARISES, HIS ENEMIES
ARE SCATTERED...

AND THOSE WHO HATE HIM
FLEE BEFORE HIM.

AS THE SMOKE IS DRIVEN AWAY
SO ARE THEY DRIVEN--

[ door slams ]
[ shouts ]

GO! GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING!

"AS THE WAX MELTS BEFORE
THE FIRE,

SO THE WICKED PERISH
AT THE PRESENCE OF GOD.

BEHOLD THE CROSS OF THE LORD.
FLEE BANDS OFENEMIES."

GET THE HOLY WATER.

OKAY, OKAY.
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

"WE DRIVE FROM US
WHOEVER YOU MAY BE!

Together: UNCLEAN SPIRITS,
ALL SATANIC POWERS,

ALL INFERNO INVADERS,
ALL WICKED LEGIONS,

ASSEMBLIES AND SECTS.

IN THE NAME AND BY THE POWER
OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

MAY YOU BE SNATCHED AWAY

AND DRIVEN FROM
THE CHURCH OF GOD

AND FROM THE SOULS
MADE TO THE IMAGE

AND LIKENESS OF GOD

AND REDEEMED BY THE PRECIOUS
BLOOD OF THE DIVINE LAMB."

[ sighs ]

[ exhaling ]

[ phone rings ]

OKAY.
OH, PHONE, OKAY.

OH, IT'S JUST MY MOM.

HELLO.

HEY, MOM.

YEAH,
EVERYTHING'S GREAT!

UH, YEAH, SHE WENT TO BED
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

YEAH... NO, NO.

OKAY,
AND HAVE A SAFE TRIP.

MOM, MOM, MOM.

WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

BYE.

MY MOM,
SHE'S SO DRAMATIC.

WOW!

IT WAS UM... INTERESTING.

YEAH.

YOU WANNA WATCH TV?

YEAH.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

[ clears throat ]

TIA!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE?

OH, BOY, OKAY...

UH... STAY HERE.

OKAY... LETS...

OH, SHIT.

SHIT.

[ TV transmission stops ]

ARE YOU KIDDING ME
RIGHT NOW?

YOU DON'T HAVE A TEMPERATURE.

SO I'LL JUST TURN UP
THE HEAT.

GOOD NIGHT.

WHY DO YOU HATE ME?

WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT,
TIA?

YOU DON'T WANT ME HERE.

I DON'T NOT WANT YOU HERE,
OKAY.

IT'S JUST THAT...

I HAVE A LOT
OF THINGS GOING ON

THAT I'M NOT HAPPY WITH,
AND THAT ARE VERY FRUSTRATING.

WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS?

WELL, THEY'RE THINGS
THAT...

THAT I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN WE'RE OLDER.

TELL ME NOW.

NO.

THEY DON'T MATTER,
OKAY?

I DON'T... DISLIKE YOU.

I THINK YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL.

AND THIS IS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU OR ME

OR US,
OR ANYTHING, OKAY,

SO GET THAT SILLY THOUGHT
OUT OF YOUR HEAD AND...

AND WE'LL BE OKAY.

YOU WANT ME HERE?

OH, AARON,
YOU MUST HATE ME

FOR EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED TONIGHT.

NO, NO,
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

WELL, YOU MUST THINK I'M CRAZY
FROM ALL THE GHOSTS,

AND THEN MY SISTER
SHE'S ALWAYS INTERFERING.

NO, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
FOR SO LONG.

OH, STOP.
NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.

OH... IT'S OKAY, NO--

[ footsteps thumping ]

CARRIE?

CARRIE, IS THAT YOU?

CARRIE?

[ TV transmission
starts ]

Sports Announcer:
THEY PLAY WITH A
LOT OF PASSION

IT'S AMAZING WHEN YOU PLAY
WITH PASSION AND ENERGY

HOW GOOD THINGS
CAN HAPPEN.

Female interviewer:
YOU HAD TOLD THEM
MORE RECENTLY THAT

IT WAS TIME FOR HIM
TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP.

WHAT STEP DID
HE TAKE TONIGHT?

KEEP IT TOGETHER, MAN.

AARON,
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

OH, MY-- WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR NOSE?

I CAN'T BE HERE.
HUH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

THERE'S SOMETHING BAD HERE.

THERE'S SOMETHING BAD HERE,
CARRIE.
YEAH, OKAY.

WE CAN... WE CAN DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT.

I CAN'T BE HERE.

AARON,
WHAT'S THE FUCKING MATTER!
I CAN'T BE HERE!

I WAS WRONG!

DON'T LEAVE, DON'T LEAVE,
DON'T LEAVE, AARON!

[ rumbling ]

[ rumbling ]

[ grunts ]

TIA, COME ON,
WE GOT TO GO.

OKAY, COME ON.

COME ON, TIA!

TIA.

NO, TIA! COME ON,
COME HERE.

GIVE ME YOUR HAND, TIA!

COME ON, DON'T GO,
COME ON!

GIVE ME YOUR OTHER HAND!

I LOVE YOU!

[ sighs ]

WITH MY SISTER?

Tia: CARRIE?

CARRIE?

MOM, MOM, MOM!

OH, MY GOD!
WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE?

WHERE'S TIA?

THERE WAS ALL THESE THINGS
AT THE DOOR--

HONEY, YOU'RE BLEEDING!

THE BATHROOM--
[ knocks on door ]

HI.

SAMANTHA MAY WE...
SPEAK TO YOU IN PRIVATE?

SURE.

Sam: [ clears throat ]

IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

SAMANTHA,
THIS IS OFFICER HARDY.

HI.

I THOUGHT I SHOULD BE
THE ONE TO TELL YOU

I'M SORRY SAMANTHA,
TIA'S DEAD.

Heather:
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

HANG ON A SECOND, HONEY.

EXCUSE ME?

IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?

I MEAN, I'M REALLY
NOT FINDING THIS FUNNY, SO...

I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT,
SAMANTHA.

IT SEEMS SHE WAS PLAYING
YESTERDAY

AFTER SCHOOL BEHIND
THE SCHOOLHOUSE,

BY THE AIR CONDITIONING UNIT.

SHE WAS ALL BY HERSELF.
THERE WAS NO ONE THERE.

THE STAIRS ARE SO STEEP--
NO.

SHE MUST HAVE FALLEN
AND HIT HER HEAD.

SHE HASN'T EVEN BEEN
TO SCHOOL TODAY, SO--

THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
TO HELP HER, SAMANTHA.

SHE HIT HER HEAD.

Hardy: MRS. LEE,
YOUR DAUGHTER'S BODY

WAS DISCOVERED THIS MORNING

THE CORONER'S ESTIMATED
THE TIME OF DEATH

AT 4:00 P.M.
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

MOMMY!

JESUS!

ALL RIGHT, PAUSE.

YOU BROUGHT MY DAUGHTER HOME
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, REMEMBER?

I WISH THE HELL THAT I HAD,
SAMANTHA.

I WISHED I HAD.

SHE'D BE ALIVE TODAY,
BUT I DIDN'T.

HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

HELLO.
HI.

CLEARLY,
YOU WERE TO UNDERSTAND

I'M NOT ALLOWED TO BRING...
OFFICER...

A CHILD HOME FROM SCHOOL.
THIS MAN IS LYING.

THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE LIE!

I DIDN'T BRING YOUR DAUGHTER
HOME YESTERDAY, SAMANTHA.

PLEASE DON'T TURN
THE LIGHTS OFF.

Aaron: EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE,

THE SPIRIT DOESN'T KNOW
THAT HE IS DEAD.

HE IS TRAPPED
IN A CERTAIN LOCATION.

I THINK THIS HOUSE
IS HAUNTED.

AN EXORCISM?

IF THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THE HOUSE,

WE'LL GET IT OUT.

WHY DO YOU HATE ME?

Aaron: SOME SPIRITS
WILL REFUSE TO LEAVE

EVEN AFTER THEY LEARN
OF THEIR OWN DEATH.

I'LL NEVER LEAVE.

WE DRIVE FROM US,
WHOEVER YOU MAY BE!

YOU DON'T WANT ME HERE.

Aaron: THIS NEGATIVE EMOTION
CAN FESTER

STRIPPING THE SPIRIT
OF ANY HUMANITY

LEAVING ONLY
AN ANGRY ENTITY.

"OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN
HEAVEN HALLOWED BY THY NAME

THY KINGDOM COME,
THY WILL BE DONE

ON EARTH
AS IT IS IN HEAVEN."

[ screams ]

CLEARLY, I-- I TOLD YOU
YESTERDAY

THAT LEGALLY,
I'M NOT ALLOWED--

LEGALLY!
TO BRING A CHILD HOME
FROM SCHOOL.

OFFICER, COULD YOU PLEASE
HAVE THIS MAN REMOVED

FROM MY PROPERTY?

I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS.

BUT I-- JUST GET--
ABSOLUTELY--

MRS. LEE!
I'M VERY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

YOU'LL HAVE TO ACCOMPANY ME
TO THE MORGUE

TO IDENTIFY THE BODY
OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

Lew: I'M SORRY, SAMANTHA.

[ gasps ]

TIA?

TIA?

HONEY?

TIA?

OH, MY POOR BABY.

TIA!

MY BABY...

OH, NO!

OH, TIA,
I'M SO SORRY.
