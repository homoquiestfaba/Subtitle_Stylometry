of you a lesson.

I wouldn't do that if I was you.

You better step back,

What ever.

You don't want to say this but...

Most of you ain't never gonna see 11

We is nothing!

So, posse, keep it real!

Now on the street,
you has got to know that your homey

Will take a cap in his ass for you.

So let's start with a very basic
trust exercise.

One, two, three.

Ali, can I have a word?

Sure.

It's about the senator.

Now, I know how much these
classes mean to you

And how much the kids enjoy them.

But I'm afraid the goverment is
withdrawing our funding

They're closing down the center.

What?

How is these kids gonna make
out in the ghetto now?

You have to go somewhere else.

Something else? Do you what
this centre means to them?

And to me?

This is the spiritual home
of the West Staines massive

This is like what Mecca is to the jews.

Is like what Kentucky is to chickens.

And it was here when I first
felt my Julie's ...

Ali, there's nothing you can do.

Now, you better go and tell the kids.

I ain't never gonna let them
close us down.

Keep it real, yeah?

The Begium prime minister
briefing in half an hour

And the deputy prime minister
urgently wishes to speak to you

Have you got the polls result yet?

Excuse me.

I wish I haven't.

He's putting 22 points behide.

What about Marrice?
-23 points behide.

The youth folks deserting us in droves

All our folks are just out of touch

Maybe we are, you know I am

Don't be ridiculous.
-Are we gonna lose this?

No chance we haven't
lost Stains in 20 years.

We're not going to start now.

We just have an image problem.

We have to find the candidate
who will improve that image

Somebody young.

Somebody ethnic.

Somebody in touch.

Exactly.
-That's absolutley right David.

We have to find an
outstanding candidate.

Who's intellectually superior.

Who can guarantee us victory.

Is Julie about?
-She's upstairs.

Hello baby, Is been missing you
so much today

You is lookin' so fine....
All I want to do is pull your panties...

Ali!

Oh. Hello my Julie.

Stop feeling up Nena and get in here.

Sorry I got confused.

Strange how you never get confused
with Tracey.

Hello Ali.

Hello.
You know you is me only bitch.

Lady, when I close my eyes
you is the only girl me ever think about

Ali, open your eyes.

Sorry, there was something in them.

Because there's these flees
that is going around.

And the two of them coming in again.

And caught in my eyes.

Ali G, you have been a very bad boy
you need to be punished.

Are you a bad boy?

Yes I am.

My skin is so dry.

So for being a bad boy.
I want you to rub oil into me.

Paying special attention to my breasts
and my back

Okay, I will do that.

But first I want you to take your hat off.

You naughty, naughty boy.

But me never take my hat off.

You take that off
and I'll take these off.

Okay.

Now, I'm going to milk you.

Ali.

Give me one more second.

Behave Alistair.

J. Lo, they is closing down the center.

So I is gonna go on hungerstrike until they
save it or until I die.

So just in case I do join Tupac and
Biggie in that ghetto in the sky

I has come here
to bone you one last time.

I think Mr. Johnson might have
something to say about that.

Can I watch?

I ain't got no problem with that.
Has you?

Ali...

Don't do nothing stupid alright.

Hear me now.
She ain't really my Julie.

Obviously in real life I is going out
with someone much fitter

But they do that to make me more accessible.

Which mean you girls out there
will think I will nob you

Even if you was a minger.

Okay, you got 10 seconds
until you start, Mac Daddy.

Okay, and go!

Mr G, why are you on hungerstrike?

In the struggle for...
In the struggle for justice!

And I is willing to lay down my life.

Just like Martin Luther.

This is local party chairman.
Alan Swan.

He'd been putting together a list
of names for the election

This is a great honour...
I've always been a particular admirer.

My name is Swan.
-Right.

candidates to match all your critera

Top of the list is

Swan, is there any reason why
there should be an absurdly dressed

Halfnaked man chained to a fence being
tossed off by an old blind council worker?

Ignore him. It's the local idiot
making some pathetic protest.

Have him unchained,
and bring him in here.

But I'm trying to go through the...
-Bring him in, Swan.

Straight ahead at top of the stairs.

Let me do all the things...
You want me to do...

main mixing finger.

Everything down there is still working,

Ali, would you sit down.
Please sit down

Have you ever consider becoming
a member of parliament?

Why would me wanna do that for?
It's full of pricks.

That's a little harsh.
I'm a M.P. Am I a prick?

Yes.

Let's try approaching this from
an different angle.

Is there nothing in the world that
you would like to change?

Yes, me want to save the leisure center.

Obviously...

As the M.P of Staines,
you could achieve that.

Would you stand as our candidate
in this bi-election?

I got to be honest.
Me ain't actually bind.

I mean,
I done it with two girls.

I seen it on the internet. But me
would never feel completely comfortable

Me being bumped by a man.
Or even bumping a man.

I know a lot of people
say never say ever.

But me feel so strong that my exit hole
should always stay my exit hole

Never become my entry hole.

You know how I stand?
-Yes.

Yes, It's been a pleasure meeting you.

Later sweetheart.

Yes, it was very helpful.

30 seconds til

Good luck

Don't hold back.

What is possibly the most crucial
bi-election of the past decade

We are joined tonight by ex-enviroment
secretary and political

heavy weight David Griffiths,
and newcomer Ali G

If you haven't made your mind up yet,
you will have done by

the end of this debate.

Ali, if elected, what would you
do for Staines?

Well, Me'd save the
leisure center ain't it?

You can't suggest that your soul
policy is to save a center

that is barely used,
and are a terrible drain on funds

What are your others policies?

My other policies?

Yes, you must have some.

Well, I think is really important to
reduce inflation

and also to invest in the nurse...

Oh, the NHS...

You're reading from my sheet.

No I ain't.
I thought out these things myself

You obviously copied from me.

It wasn't me.

Perhaps you'd like to tell me where
you stand on the ERM

No problem.

Me thought the first album was wack

And to be honest me ain't
all in their music.

Quick frankly the voters of Staines
deserve better. 

You're making a mockery of this debate.

What? Is you looking in the mirror?

All you're doing is making it
obvious to all the voters

out there what an absolute
buffoon you are!

Talking about yourself again?

You are an embarrassment to your party
and to the people of Staines

That is not a very nice way to talk
about your mum.

I put it to you, that you are
the worst possible candidate

ever put foward
by your miserable party

Well, I put it to you...

...that you sucked off a horse!

I did not...
suck off a horse.

I have already dealt with this issue
with the party chairman

And as I explained to him,
I was out hunting with a friend

and I slipped onto the end
of an horse's fallos

Which unfortunately, owing to
it beeing the mating season, was aroused.

Another dramatic day in the Staines
bi-election saw the unexpected withdrawal

the opposition candidate David Griffiths.

Tomorrow's vote now become
a two horse race

between Thomas Alvares
and Ali G

With the result too close to call.

Thomas Alvares Liberal Democrates
5080 votes.

Alistair Lesile Gramham
-Who?

What a stupid name.

5086 votes.

You won! You made it!

Ali G has been duly elected
as member of parliament

for Staines.

Now, do you want to see the new
member of parliament?

Look how I is touching myself.

Do you like that?

Is that turnin' you on?

Not really.

Would you like to give a kiss
to Mr Gurkin?

Oh baby you're so long and hard.

That's the hand brake.

Now let's get jiggy!

Is it in yet?

Hey, hey I know you. You is the giz
that did it with that pussy ain't it?

Respect.

They is dissin' our posse.
I is gonna sort this.

What is he doing?

Umm...I'm not sure, Prime minister.

Relax.

Look at you.

All you ever do day long
is cuss each other.

RESTECP.
Do you even know what that spells?

Restecp?

Yes. Restecp.

How is anyone out there meant
to restecper each other

if you lock in here and don't even start

Restecping one and other.

Do you know how I'd make
this country better?

It's simple, two words.

"Keep it real!"

That's 3 words.

That be a spanic. "IT"
ain't no real word

is short for ini'it.

Keep it real...

The member of Staines will be banned
from the house

Is it because I is black?

What in gods name have
you done to me?

Restecp?

I want that idiot in my office in the
morning with his letter of resignation

Is that clear?

Come in.

Listen. Me know me done wrong.

Ali, haven't you read the papers?

I can't believe it!

There's a dog that can
play table tennis!

Ali it's the Press,
they love you.

But how can he hold the bat?

Ali, the deputy Prime minister
and I were wondering...

What would you say if I asked you
to join the cabinet?

No, think about it.
Ali joins the cabinet

The two of them are public
allied together.

Ali slips up,
and he take that old prat with him.

What makes you think Ali will join?

Cause I've suggested to the
prime minister

that he offers to save his leisure center.

Are you mad...

Let me finish.

Offers to save his leisure center,
if Ali can secure him a 20 point lead

in the polls.

Now I is in the cabinet and all that,
could I have a look at the red button?

Can I trust you?

Yes.
-Alright.

Now - one touch on that red button -
could destroy the whole world.

That is very interesting you say that because...

No! No! Ali please stand away.

Can't we just blow up something?

Of course not.

Please?
-No.

Just somewhere shitty like Wales.
-Ali

I heard the Prime Minister of Wales
called your a slug.

I am the Prime Minister of Wales!

Well, you shouldn't talk that way
about your mum, ain't it?

Your first cabinet meeting
is next Thursday

We're going to be discussing the asylum seekers

I'm sending you on a fact-finding mission.

If anybody wants to smuggle
anything into Britain.

Chances are they will
come through here.

And it's not just immigrants.

Take a look at this.

You'll be appalled.

Look at this crap.

30 kilos of marijuana

Smuggled in from Europe, South America
and the Middle East.

That is terrible.

Is there any skunk?

Yes. Some scumbag managed to
smuggle in 15 kilos of this

Turns out it's the strongest
superskunk ever discovered!

Over here is where we keep the
confiscated weapons.

You must have such a laugh here!

No, we don't.

This next section is where we keep
the mountains

of hardcore pornography
most of it coming from Germany

You may not want to look at this...

No! I got a job to do.

I know. It makes me feel sick too.

Well, I is gonna have to compile my report now,

so if you wouldn't mind fucking off.

Certainly, sir.

They'll be sending me down a couple
of experts to help with my research

Hello. We is experts.

Well, Ali. Tell us what did you
find out in Dover?

Well, we saw a lot of stuff.
Most of it from Germany

Of these blokes, all going in
through the back door.

He's absolutely right.

I've been to Germany and experienced
it myself

Respect.

I remember one time there were
these two huge African men

who managed to squeezed themselves
into this tiny box.

How long was they in there for?

15 hours

It was incredibly emotional.

Must have hurt a lot.

It still does.

Sorry.

So John, what are we going to do
about these asylum seekers?

We can't just let them all in.

It would cripple the economy.

Yes Ali?

Let's think about this right?

What is the main thing we ain't
got enough of in this country?

Hospitals?

No.

Libraries?

We ain't got enough fit women.
And we has got too many mingers.

No offense.

So why don't we just let in all the fit
refugees and turn away all the ramp ones?

That way we solve both problems.

We is nobbig two birds with one
conny, ain't it?

What do you think?

I think we should keep it real.

Fit.

Fit.

Wait.

Back to Slovenia.

Education standard are
at their lowest in 15 years.

That is because kids is learning stuff
that ain't no use to them.

I mean who here has ever used maps?

Or English?

Exactly.

Let's start making education relevant.

So, if Kevin buys 6 oz of
Jamaican sensimilia from Fat Tony

For £480, cash in hand

And has to divide it amongst
eleven of his customers

How much did he charge for 1/8

So that he can make £100 profit
to pay off his child support?

The situation in Northern Ireland
is threathing to spiral

out of all control.

The only way you is ever gonna get
those Hinuds to stop killing them Islams,

It's actually Catholics
fighting Protestants.

What ever.

Is if you get some really fit woman
to get her babylons out for peace.

Prime Minister.
Not you, love.

The army is costing the Brittish
tax payers 4.2 billion pounds a year

How does the government
intend to reduce this figure?

We is gonna hire the A-team.

Her majesty, the Queen

Your majesty, may I introduce Ali G,
member of parliament for Staines.

You is much fitter
than you look in them coins.

Tell you next time I put a
50 pence piece in my pocket

Me will feel honoured having your
head some close to my nuts.

The jobs figures are of their
highest level.

This country has a special relationship
with the United States

What do you think of Bush?

Me love bush!

I mean, me love anything that gives
foliage to the punani-area

Would you do a dance for me, please?

Oh my gosh.

Shaven heaven!
Respect!

...as Ali G's influence grows
ever stronger...

...Ali G storms the parliament...

...Ali G mania sweeps the UK...

As of 12 o'clock.

All Rizla's will be free.

To discourage their use, there will be a
levy of 25 pence on the pound on panties.

This will exclude thongs.

As for the heatlh service.

Marjuana will be made available

For the treatments of chronic diseases.

Such as itchy scrunt.

Furthermore

We was just talking about the politics.

I ain't interested in what you've got to say!
Shut up!

For real. Me won't speak no more.

You really are a prank.

Now come here!

We can't. This is the P.M.'s bedroom.

Well?

Cheeky?

Ladies and gentlemen...

So first President Muephu.

Would you care to join me upstairs?
-My pleasure.

Thank you.

I must say I enjoyed that.

So did I.

I'm so glad we trashed it out.

Ladies and gentlemen, I want everyone to know
than President Muephu here is a very big man.

I would like you to know
that the Prime Minister

was very hard,

but very straight.

The President here was very much 
on top to start off with

and I don't mind telling you
I was in a deep hole

Oh very deep.

Yes, but eventhough we had
some sticky patches,

I'm delighted to say we came
together finally in the end.

Yes, I lapped up everything
that you had to offer.

Now President Numpeba, would you care
to join me upstairs?

No bloody way!

Can I come?

Come on Ali, let's go home.

I'll cook you up your favourite.

Mmmmm - butterscotch!

This bit is for the girls.
To show that me can be well sensitive

By the way, if any of you bitches

But not by too much obviously.

I can't.

They need me at the
peace conference tomorrow

You what?

What about the people who
really need you?

What about Ricky?

What about Dave?

What about me Ali?

Please come back to Staines.

The world is bigger then Staines.

And me got to save it.

Well, you'll have to do it
on your own then.

Julie? Julie?

We've got to get rid of him before
this bloody center is saved

What I thought...
-You thought?!?

The United States will do
everything in it's power

to support Chad in it's stuggle
against it's neighbours.

Russia will not allow this
western oppression to continue.

In order to support Burkina Faso,

is prepared to utilize all our
military capabilities.

Ali, Ali, Ali!

Could be armageddon breaking out!
Please help me will you?

Sure, bro.

United State will not be intimidated!

We are prepared to meet any show of force
with our full military might!

Wait!
Do you know why there is no shine in there?

It's cause they ain't been fed their teas!

Come on, choppy-chop.

Moving to emotion, all those in favour
of sending a ran down to the gas station

to get some potato chips
and chocolate

Oh bummer.

I'm sorry we invaded you.
It was really un-cool.

Who cares? It's all in the past.

And hey - if I was going to
be invaded by anyone,

I am happy it was you.

You are really cool.
You have nice clothes.

You saved my white ass, Ali.

No problem.
Big up, the herbal tea, aiiight!

Hey you! Britain!

You know, we're quite a team Ali.

It's thanks to you,
we are 22 points ahead.

I'm going to save that center of yours.

Check out all the pepperami!

There're for, you Ali.

This is your moment.

Will you comment on accusations that
you drugged the leaders of the world?

You what?

We have evidence that proves you're guilty.

Well, we have evidence
that proves you're guilty.

This is just childish.

This is just childish.

Aren't you by employing this absurd, retorical
tactic merely incriminating yourself further?

Aren't you by dabadabda tactic
just simanama your father?

This bag was sent to my office
anonymously this morning.

Do you deny that you stole it from
customs and exiles?

That could be anyones.

What's it got to do with me, come on.

I has got to go.

I is actually touching cloth.

Ali, Ali!

Oh dear.
There you goes your leisure center.

Clear your desk before you go, will you?

Prime minister.

We'll miss you, Mr G.
Respect.

Mum?

Can I borrow your car?

Having a bad day?

Maybe I can help...

Is it nippy outside?

Very.

What is you doing here?

Let me show you.

So today's main news again.

The prime minister has resigned
after the discovery of a video tape

from a security camera showing
him having sexual intercourse

with an unknown prostitute.

That ain't no prostitute!
That's my hoe!

As of 11 o'clock this morning,
the deputy Prime Minister

David Carleton will be acting
Prime Minister.

Well, that ain't fair.
That weren't the P.M

Why aren't they showing
the rest of the tape?

Unfortunately, my boss has
locked it in the safe

at his new office at Chequers,
that's where it's staying.

You ain't gonna get away with this.

If you keep your month shut,

David's willing to be very generous.

I'm willing to be very generous.

All that you have to do
is keep your mouth shut.

I'm tuning up my engine, Ali.

Fill me with petrol!

I is gonna to pump you with my
five star unleaded, aiiight!

Let me see your nozzle.

What?

Oh, you wanna see my nob?

Alright.

Give me your fuel injection.

"...and in tomorrows phone in,
we'll be asking this question:"

"Have you ever slept with a pig?
I know I certaily have!"

"...and we'll be finding out what turns
girls like this into slugs..."

No one calls my Julie a slag!

Come to mama!

Take them off!

This ain't right.

Here set it to vibrate
and finish yourself off!

Open up, open up!
Your blood, I need your help!

Everyone on the tele
is calling my Julie a slag.

What I heard about her three header at ???


What three header?

Nothing.
-Anyways I can prove that she ain't

We've gotta restart Drive-by FM.
What do you say?

Drive-by FM is back on the road!

This is Drive-by FM

The sound of the ghetto coming to you
from deep in the heart of Barkshire

What was that?

Helicopter.

Hear me now, gangsters.
There is some serious shit going down.

The prime minister, check it,

has been chunked out
by a geezer

who is a massive dong.

He is even more eviller
than Skeletor!

To get the P.M. back in,

we needs to get hold of this tape
of me nobbin' my bitch.

If you help me rescue this video,
we can save the country.

Plus you will get to see
my Julie's babylons!

Oh, wicked!

That is why I is calling in all of you.
To end the Barkshire turf wars.

There's been enough brothers slain.

So put down your AKs.

Lay down your Uzis.

And unite into one massive
Massive!

And me never thought
me would ever say this:

But big up, the East Staines Massive.

Ali! What are you doing, man?!

If you join us.
Tonight I is prepared to hand over

the Borrester spider climbing frame
in Leargrove Park.

Let's do what Tupac and Biggie
never managed, alright.

Here it is, here it is!
If you wish joining us

for this military operation, then
meet up wearing your camouflage

and your combat gear. The venue is
outside John Nike Lesiure Center,

at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

Actually that's a bit early.
Can we make it 12?

Sorry I is late.

But there was something
on the tele about monkeys...

It was really funny...

Respect to all of you for
wearing your camouflage.

It will help you go undetected.

No let's go to Chequers
and rescue that tape.

Let's do this for Britain.

Let's do this for my Julie.

And let's do this for hip hop.

Selecta!
Selecta!

Hear me now. I has drawn up
a detailed plan of Checkers.

The tape is in the P.M's office.
In a safe.

First up, Ricky, Dave
and me will go in.

Jessie, you stay here.

We is gonna be like the A-team.

And I is B.A. Baraccas!

No, I wanna be B.A. Baraccas!

But I is very much like him!
"I ain't gettin' in no plane!"

Uhuh - "I ain't goin on no plane!"
What?

"I ain't gettin' in no plane!"

"I ain't goin on no plane!"

"I ain't gettin' in no plane!"

"I ain't goin on no plane!"
That's James Brown!

You'll be Murdoc,
and Dave, you'll be Face.

But what do we do?

You lot stay here,
and we all hide,

and blend in to the natural habitat.

Then when it gets dark,
me will make the secret signal

Let's go!

At that point you will tune in
all your radios

to the baddest speed-garage station,
and crank up the volume to the max!

This will bring out the guards.

And at that point, we will use our
cunning to over power them.

Sir?
-What the hell is going on?

I'm sure it's nothing to worry about sir,
but I'll send some men out to check.

See that you do. I want maximum security.
Patrol the house.

The great hall is exactly like the one
in Lara Croft's house

You know in Tomb Raider 2 in Playstation.

So Dave, if you run at the pillar that will
take us through to the underwater kingdom,

and on to the next level.

If for some reason that don't work,

we must find a way to cross the
"touch sensitive floor"

if we lift our feet at all,
we're dead!

Nothing. We'll keep on looking.

Next up, we has gotta go through
the laser room.

Dave, you will use your
special skills to help us through.

Remember if we break
any of these beams,

it will set the alarms off.
So extra careful!

Now let's do it!

This must be the P.M's office.

The tape is in there.

Intruders in my offce.
This is a terrorist attack.

Shoot on sight.
Repeat, shoot on sight!

The safe. Yeah I is safe, man.
Open that.

The safe...
Yeah I is feelin' fine! Now open it!


Behind you!

Hold on, I thought you couldn't speak!

It's not really that, I've always been
terribly embarrassed about my voice.

Alright, don't go on about it.

Stop giving it all that.

Now if me can just interrupt
your life story for one second.

Let's tie these geezers up,
and get that safe open.

No...
I've got it!

Why don't we link up the batteries
of all the cars outside here,

and then transfer an electrical current
through a human chain,

and blow this mother open!

But won't we get electrocolocuted?

Yeah, we'll blow the batteries,
but we won't get fried as long as the chain

don't break, cause we all wearing
rubber sole trainers ain't it?

Trust me, man!
I got a D in phsyic you know.

Wicked!

No, b82rez,
batteries!

2g4,
together!

Me was trying to save time.

Switch on the engine pass it on.

Switch on the engine pass it on.

Haha, your voice!
Switch on the engine pass it on.

Bitch on the pension,
suck my dong!

What?

Shall I turn the engine on?

Yeah.

What are you doing?
I can't help it! I'm beeing pulled!

No!

Peace, man.
-Peace.

The tape ain't there!

What are you talking about?
-Look for yourself!

All there is is some photographes...

And there's a...
A map of Staines.

Jah Rastafari, Haile Selassi, I an' I!
They is extending the Heathrow Airport!

That means...
They is gonna destroy Staines.

And he is starting in 3 hours.

2 hours, 57 minutes to be precise.

Why has you gotta build this
terminal over Staines?

Because I have bought 600 acres
of land there. Can I have those please?

Now, don't try escaping from here because
this room doubles at a nuclear bunker

It is completely impenetrable
to the outside world.

And I've have forgotten to
put on the air supply.

Why don't you just nip outside
now and stick it on?

You know, you really are
unbelieveably stupid!

Hey!

What?
-Give me them plans!

Or what?
-Or nipple cripple, that's what!

Chinese burns!

You hit me on the nose,
you fucking nutcase!

I ain't being funny, but
you should look behind you

because there is like a thousand 
police officers behind you!

Look, look behind you!
There is Jennifer Lopez!

What? You wanna bone him
right this second,

'cause you is feeling so horny,
that if you don't get it now...

Look, there's 20 squid on the floor...

There is a squirrel with the head
of a chicken, and with fly...

...wings and everything...
It's just...

Is you gonna hit me again?
-Uhuh...

Now I'm going to shoot you.

This is from the people of Staines!

I think I followed through.

My Julie, are you there?

Me know what you must think of me.

I've been a piece of knob cheese.

But me got to save Staines, and
me can't do it on my own, and...

...and I has shat myself...

Shit! Ricky and Dave.

Ricky?

We thought that if we was gonna die,
we might as well give it a go...

Well, what's it like?

It's not bad, you know.

Dave?
-Quite nice, actually.

We'll talk about this later.

Now we got to save Staines.

2 minutes? See you in the car?
-Alright, be quick,

the feds is coming, and
you don't wanna finish up inside!

I wouldn't do that if I was you.

Ali! I love you!!!

Julie!!!

Hello.

Ignore them and start
the demolition.

Wait! Don't listen to him!

He's a criminal!
And not even the good kind

that sells drugs and do drive-bys...

I has got proof here, that
he is trying to destroy Staines.

So what?
It's a shit-hole!

Arrest them.
-Oh shit.

We is going to jail!

Every day for the next 20 years,
we is gonna get bonged in the showers!

Hold it!
Release them.

Under what authority?

In case you've forgotten,
I am the acting prime minister.

You are the disgraced one.

Disgraced by you!

And this tape proves it.

Kate...
-No David.

When I first entered politics,

it was to create a better world.

A world of honesty, integrity and truth.

But somewhere along the way,
that vision was lost.

My dream was tornished,
and instead I discovered greed,

averseness and corruption...
-Boring!

Arrest him.

Enjoy your life with this fool.

You two deserve each other.

-Piss off!

And you can rest assured we're not
gonna build terminal 5 over Staines.

We're gonna demolish Slough instead.
-Wicked! 

As of right now, I'm gonna need
a new deputy prime minister

How would you feel about
being my right hand man?

Right hand man!
Batty-boy, batty-boy!

What do you say Ali?
-I has shown you the way.

You will have to carry on
the journey by yourself now.

As for me, I is gonna
stick with my posse.

And my bitch...
My lady.

-The end-

Actually, there is one thing
you could do for me...

This way, ambassador.

The crop is ready for inspection.

Good morning, ambassador.

Ambassador,
will you try the harvest?

This is good shit!

The man from Staines -
He say yeah!

Ice, please.

Ali, this is a great jacuzzi!
-That ain't the jacuzzi.

Sorry.

Bring her in.

Dance for me, bitch!

My Julie, me got something to ask you...

Will you make me
the happiest man in the world?

Yeah, I will!

Let me shag her then!

So...
What did you think of the film?

It wasn't bad, was it?

It was easily better
than Harry Potter...

which me thought was very childish.

If you was watching this Potter,
I is better than you!

You probably ain't even slept with a girl!

I have slept with three...
And I got one of them to play with herself.

Anyways, whatever you thought of this film,
please tell your mates that it was wicked!

Cause if this flops,
me won't be able to get my nanny a new hip.

So the choice is yours,
no pressure...

Come in, nanny, I told them about it.
What?! You has fallen over again?

What, you've done the other one in as well!

Don't cry there, all mashed up,
a lump of bones!

Me will get you the cash
to make it better, somehow...

Don't be selfish.
Buy the merchandise and all...
