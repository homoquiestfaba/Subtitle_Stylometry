[whooping and laughing]

[man] Get over here!
[gasps]


[ants continue shrieking]

what do you see?

the scorpion,

it needs help.

Life is cruel, Satoshi.

It doesn't care
where you are from,

what God you pray to.

It is.

So you must face it head on.

See the scorpion?

No matter how many enemies,

it continues on.

It is strong, yes.

It is fast.

But do you know why
the scorpion is feared?

Its will.

Willpower is what makes
your destiny your own.

Learn to be strong,
here and here.

Promise me you'll
remember that?

I will, Papa.

Now, let's get home.

Your mother is making dinner,

and she won't be happy
if we're late.

[Satoshi chuckles and grunts]

Hold on.
[yells]

Faster, Papa, faster! [laughs]

[continues laughing] More!

[Hanzo chuckles]

Your papa needs a break.

[wind gushing]

Where is everyone, Papa?

Hold tight, Satoshi.

[both grunting]

[Satoshi gasps]

[assassin groans]



[both grunting]



[Satoshi panting]

[Satoshi shrieking]

[both grunting]

[Hanzo grunts]


[gasps]
[Satoshi whimpers]


[stifled sob]

Harumi.


Harumi!

Harumi!


[Satoshi whimpering]


[assassin yells]


[grunting continues]

[whimpering]
[blades slicing]

[grunting continues]

[Hanzo roaring]


[assassin shrieking]

[Hanzo panting]

[grunting angrily]




[Sub-Zero] Enough!

[Satoshi groans]

[Satoshi whimpering]

[Sub-Zero] Come further,
and he dies.

What do you want?

[Satoshi groans]

[Sub-Zero] On your knees.

[Satoshi whimpering]


Ahh! [grunts]


[grunts angrily]

If you touch a hair
on his head...



Satoshi!

Satoshi!


[Hanzo sobs] Satoshi.

Satoshi!

Satoshi!

I'll kill you!

I'll kill you!


[Hanzo grunts]

[Hanzo panting]

You'll die for this.

You first.

[Hanzo grunts]

[opening theme music playing]




[heart beating]


Lord Raiden!

I'm sorry. I... I didn't know.

No, you did well, Lui Kang.

Just as you were taught.

And now, I pray it is enough.

Enough? Then it is time.

Yes. Do not worry.

We have prepared for this
moment for a long time.

I chose you
for a reason, Lui Kang.

Now, the others
will be gathering.

We must hurry.

Lord Raiden, what others?


We can make this work,
I promise.

What do I have to do, huh?

How about cleaning this
hell-hole you call a home?

How about doing something

besides crying
about your career?

care about yourself!

It's all about Johnny Cage.

Call me when you grow up.

[door slams]

So, I can still call her then.

That's a W.


[upbeat cell phone
ringtone playing]

Hey! You're in the cage
with Johnny.

Oh, well.

If it isn't
my long-lost agent.

It's about time you called.

Of course, I'm interested
in something different.

What have I been
telling you? Yeah.

China?

Uh-huh. All right, well,
what about an advance?

Uh, things have gotten
a little... [chuckles]

Little tight around here.

[phone disconnects and beeps]

Hello? Hello.

Well, I'm off to China!


[indistinct shouting]

[punches landing]

Kick him in the face!




You gonna keep crying like
a bitch or fight like a man?


[grunting]
[groaning]


[Sonya grunts]


[crowd cheering]

Yeah, yeah, that's right.

This is no place
for a little girl.

[echoing repeatedly] This is
no place for a little girl...

This is no place
for little girls.


Do you think this is funny?

Congratulations, cadet.

You've just become
my new pet project.

<i>You think you're pretty
special, don't you, princess?</i>

<i>Sir! My name
is Sonya Blade,</i>

<i>and I'm going to be the best
soldier you've ever met! Sir!</i>

[Jax] <i>We'll see about that.</i>
[man groans]

You wanted to see me, sir?

Yes, I did.

I'm putting together
a task force.

High-level spec ops stuff.

Are you in?

[man roars]
[Sonya grunts]

I'm gonna kill you!

You're gonna try.

[both grunting and groaning]


[Sonya grunts]
[yells and grunts]

[man] That's my car!
[crowd cheering and laughing]

Not yet, whore.



[Sonya grunts]

[man coughs]

My teeth. My teeth!

Honestly, it's an improvement.

Oh, shit!


[crowd cheering]

[crowd chanting] Sonya!

Sonya! Sonya!

Sonya! Sonya!

He'll be there?

If he's not,

there's nowhere on Earth
you'll be able to hide from me.

Understand?



Satoshi.

Harumi.

[demons snarling]

What is this?

Where am I?




without me.

Ah!

Fresh meat.


What in the hell...

Close. Netherrealm.

[Hanzo grunting]

It's no use.

You are a prisoner here.


For how long?

[laughs maliciously]

Forever.

Listen.

[indistinct cries and screams]


Do you hear it?

The symphony of pain.

Your voice will soon
join the others,

rising up to please
the great Shinnok.

Shinnok?

The master of Netherrealm.

There.

The only place of reprieve
in this realm.

Look on it
and weep. [chuckles]

Sharp enough.

[Hanzo straining]

[grunting in pain]

Calm yourself.

Save your energy
for what is about to come.

[Hanzo gasps]

[screams and groans]

Now you see,

you feel pain,

though you can
no longer perish.

We can do this

for all eternity.

[indistinct muttering]

Huh?

What is it you say?

[continues muttering]

Is that a prayer? [laughs]

No.

No God can help you here.

I need no God!

[grunts]
[demon groans]


I will take pleasure
in ripping your flesh

from your bones!


[roars in pain]

[roaring and grunting]

[demon 2] Human,

you have made
a big mistake.

There are thousands of us,
and only one of you.


[demons growling]


[demons growling and snarling]



Shinnok!

No, Shinnok is...

indisposed.

Then go fetch him for me.


I am Quan Chi,

in charge of this realm

until the master's return.

And who do I have
to thank for ruining my rug?

Hanzo Hasashi.

Your reputation precedes you,
Hanzo Hasashi.

Welcome. Though,

I'm not entirely sure
how you made it here.

What is it you want, Hanzo?

To return home.

To seek my revenge.

Home?


You can't return home.


You will do as I say,

or I will flay you alive.

[Hanzo grunts]

Did you think me
defenseless, dog?

In my realm no less.

[Hanzo groaning]

You may be a vengeful spirit,

but even they
have their limits.

[Hanzo screaming]


Besides, that's not what
you really want, is it?

Once a generation,
there is a tournament.

During that time,

the veil is lifted,

so that warriors may gather to
fight on behalf of their realm.

I can send you there.

I fight for you?

[Quan Chi] Because he will
be in attendance.


What do you want?

[Quan Chi] Good, skilled
and smart. [laughs]

Long ago,

my master, Shinnok,
was unjustly imprisoned.

This is the key to his release.

It's being kept
at the temple of Shang Tsung,

the putrid mortal

that has the favor
of the emperor of Outworld.

The tournament will take place
on his island.

Get me that key.

Once my master is released,

he can return your family.

Even you,
back to the mortal realm.

Do we understand
each other, Hanzo?

Hanzo is dead.

Call me Scorpion.

[boat horn blows]

Hold the boat! I'm coming!



Coming through. I'm co...

Whoa, whoa... [grunts]


Mmm?

[clears throat] Hope no fans saw that.
I'm wearing slip-ons.

Lui Kang,
of the White Lotus Society.

Johnny Cage,
of the superstar variety,

but you probably knew that.

And you are?

Not interested.

Oh, you will be.
They always are.

So, you guys
in this thing, too?

Yes, I have trained
many years for this moment.

Oh, yeah? Listen,

I love acting classes and all,

but they're really
kind of a time suck.

You know what I mean?
No? Anyway,

my agent said this would
really put me back on the map.

Kind of a back-end-deal-type-of-thing.
Should be fun.

approaching the veil.

Who is that? Let me guess.

He's kind of like
our, uh, Merlin.

That is Lord Raiden.

Protector of Earthrealm.

Boom! Nailed it.
Wait, Earthrealm?

Did you guys get
a script already or something?

Look, I'd love a copy.

I have no idea
what you're talking about,

but I am pretty good
at improv. So, uh...

Lord Raiden, right?

Good to meet you.

So, tell me more
about this veil.

The space between realms,

to prevent Outworld
from merging with Earthrealm.

Prevented by what?

Always the soldier,

evaluating risks.

What guards the veil is of less
consequence than why it does so.

If Shao Kahn
wins this tournament,

Earth, as you know it,
will cease to exist.

Not to fear, Lord Raiden.

I, Johnny Cage,

will make sure that
Earthrealm, [softly] so dumb,

will be safe from harm.

You have my word on it.

Lord Raiden,
these are the champions you gathered?

You doubt my choices?

No, I just meant...

You see only what is in front
of you, Lui Kang,

but your eyes deceive you.

It is what is inside
that matters.

Sonya Blade,

a most formidable warrior.

She has had
to prove herself against many

who thought she was
nothing more than a weak girl.

Believe me,
she is anything but.

And him? He only seems to be concerned
about himself and material wealth.

[muttering angrily]

keep him alive,

until he finds something more
to care about.

Something greater
than himself to live for.

[Johnny Cage]
Are you kidding me?

I paid extra for international,
and I can't even get a signal.

Uh, Raiden, are getting one?


What in the...


Stay in the vessel.

It is under
Lord Raiden's protection.

Out there,
there's nothing good.

Oh, right.

Paparazzi.

We've arrived.

Look.

That must be the bad guy.

One at a time, everybody.
One at a time.

Brought enough
for everyone. Okay.

Where'd you guys
put my trailer?

I'd like to freshen up
before we start shooting.

Ugh.

He has no idea
what he is doing.

Should we tell him?

His journey
is one of discovery.

Besides, I find it amusing.

Remember our deal, Scorpion.

[Johnny Cage panting]


Whoa.

[crowd cheering]


Yeah! Yeah!



[crowd cheering]

Be on guard.

Shang Tsung
is not to be trusted.

Oh, look!
Craft services. Great!

[Sonya sighs]

any of this stuff is organic?


Just asking. Geez!

Now is your chance.

[drums beating]

[all cheering]

[Shang Tsung] <i>In the beginning,</i>

<i>were the elder Gods.</i>

<i>In their wisdom,</i>

<i>they created a tournament</i>

<i>to safeguard each realm
from the threat of invasion.</i>

<i>Once a generation,</i>

<i>the finest warriors
must do battle</i>

<i>to decide the fate
of their realm.</i>

<i>The winner will be
granted long life</i>

<i>and great power.</i>

<i>If one realm wins
the tournament ten times,</i>

<i>they will have the right
to merge with the other,</i>

<i>and rule as they see fit.</i>

<i>I, Shang Tsung,</i>

<i>emissary of
the great Shao Kahn,</i>

<i>emperor of Outworld,</i>

<i>winner of the last nine
tournaments against Earthrealm,</i>

welcome you
to Mortal Kombat.

[crowd cheering]
[man] Mortal Kombat!


Now,

as host of this tournament,

I think it only fitting that
I provide you with some...

entertainment. [claps]

Kano.


Jax! [grunts]


Jax! [grunts]

Listen, you son of a bitch,

you better open this,
whatever it is,

or I'm gonna use your ass as
my own personal punching bag.

Oh, that is so hot.

[Sonya grunting]

[Jax] Princess.
Asshole.

I told you to wait for me.

I got excited.

You got caught
by that idiot Kano.


Unless you want me to rip that
pencil-thin mustache off your face,

I think it's best
you let me go, old man.

Absolutely.

You are free
to leave at any time.

The doorway is right there.

Of course,

you have to get past
my champion.

[drums beating]


[all chanting]
Goro! Goro! Goro!

[chanting continues]

[chanting continues]

What the hell?

[crowd cheering]


[Goro growls]

Jax! No!

Relax, kid. I've got this.

All right, ugly.

You wanna dance?

Let's dance.







Let me guess.

Quan Chi promised you life
if you would do his bidding.

Ah... No.

Not you. Someone else.

Someone you lost.

Someone you care about.

Do you think Quan Chi
is a man to be trusted?

What choice do I have?

We all have choices.

Live in the past,

or live for the future.

The key won't
solve your problems.

It will, however,
create new ones.


Revenge is too heavy
a burden to carry.

You are a free man.

It's time you start
acting like it.

[Jax groans]

[Jax panting]

[crowd cheering]
[man laughing]

[indistinct shouting]

[Jax groaning]



Really, Goro, you shouldn't
play with your food.

[Goro growls]

[groaning, screaming]

[bones snapping]


[Jax screaming]

Stop it! You'll kill him.

That's the idea.

Finish him.

[Jax screaming]

[bones snapping]


[all cheering]

No!

[all cheering]

Yeah!

Pfft! Fake.

These special effects suck.

[Goro growls]


[electricity crackling]
[Goro grunts]

[Shang Tsung] You forget
yourself, Lord Raiden.

You are not to interfere
in the tournament.

I was unaware
the tournament had begun.

[electricity crackling]

[Goro growls and grunts]

We are here for Mortal Kombat,

not your barbarism.

As you wish.

Kano!


Hold on! I'm coming for you!

You hear me?

No matter what!
I'm coming for you!

Wow! She's great.

that is some serious method acting there.

Am I right?


I can see we're all anxious
to get started.

Good.

I have determined
your opponents

and where on the island
you will fight.

Let Mortal Kombat begin!

Uh... Okay.

That was weird.

Did someone slip me something?

Or... Holy shit!

Hello? Sonya?

Lord Reagan? Radar?
Whatever your name is.

This thing better not
go straight to video.

Gunpowder?

Must be some
sort of old fortress.

Bingo.

Hard as a fossil.

No craft services, no trailers.

My agent is gonna hear
about this when I get home.

Sheesh.
[clanking]

Hello?

I should at least get
a per diem.

[growls menacingly]

Oh, hey, how's it goin'?

That... That is
one hell of a costume.

[Baraka growling]
[grunting]


you wanna do this now?


Whoa, buddy, pro-tip.

Uh, next time, pop a few mints.

[grunts, groans]

Whoa! Whoa! Go easy!

We haven't even rehearsed.

Hey, asshole!

That was custom! Dick.
[growls]


[Baraka snarls]

And barrel.




[Baraka growling]
[grunts]



Eat me, buttercup.

[grunts, panting]

Toasty.

[ominous music playing]

[thuds]
[grunts]



[breathing heavily]



Come on! Face me like a man!




[Sonya grunts]

[Reptile snarls]

All right, asshole.
Let's see what you've got.




[Sonya grunts]

[Sonya grunts]
[Reptile snarls]


[both grunting]

[Sonya yells]


[Sonya grunts]


[Reptile choking]

Not so fun now, is it,
you cold-blooded bastard?

[Sonya straining]

Heads up!

Fuck with the Blade,
you're gonna get cut. [kisses]



[straining, grunts]

[Scorpion grunting]
[groans]

You move like the Shirai Ryu.

But they're dead.

Who are you? What do you want?

Revenge!

Tell me, Lin Kuei scum,

where is Sub-Zero?

[choking, spits]

Die, knowing I will kill
every last member

of the Lin Kuei on this island.

Every last one.


[both grunting]

You are Raiden's
chosen one. [chuckles]

No wonder your realm
has lost so many tournaments.


[Kitana grunting]

[Kitana cries out]

I do not wish to hurt you.

Spare me your pity.


[both grunt]

[Kitana yells]


[Lui Kang] Do not get up.

I take no pleasure in hurting
such a worthy foe.

But, know this.
I will do whatever it takes

to defend Earthrealm,
and win this tournament.


Shao Kahn cannot be defeated.

He will take your world,
and you will bow your knee

like countless others
before you.

I promise you, I will never bow
before that madman.

I yield.

What makes you so sure
you will win?

Because I have something
no one in Outworld has.

What?
Hope.

[Shang Tsung]
Impressive, Raiden.

Your warriors have made it
further than I would have thought.

They are strong in spirit,
Shang Tsung.

You will not win today.

I have heard
such promises before.

Thankfully, after Goro kills

whomever makes it
to the final round,

I will not have to
hear them again.

And, Quan Chi,
your warrior from Netherrealm,

he is proving to be
quite formidable.

For the glory of Outworld,

I serve at the pleasure
of Shao Kahn.

Indeed.

You won't succeed.

No matter how many foes
you put between

the Earthrealm fighters
and your champion,

they will make it to the end.

Oh? I'm glad you feel that way.

Surely you know
of the Black Dragon.

It seems that several have
made it onto the island

with orders to kill
your Earthrealm friends.

How dare you?

Are you accusing me
of something, Lord Raiden?

You brought them here

to interfere
with the tournament!

And break the rules?

Even I am not so bold
as to anger

the elder Gods in such a way.

You will not succeed,
Shang Tsung.

We'll know soon enough,
won't we?

for a frozen margarita.

[Sonya] Hey!
[yelps]

Really?

I know, look at this shirt.
It's ridiculous.

I'm glad to see you, though.

Okay, you won't believe this,

but this isn't
some sort of movie.

This is the real deal. Maybe a snuff
film or something. I don't know.

But I had to fight some, uh...

I don't even know what it was.

I barely got out alive.

I can believe that.

Listen, I'll get you
out of here,

but we'll need to
stick together.

First rule of combat
is to secure our position.

Let's find somewhere
to hole up,

and then we can start recon.

Find out where we are,
what we are up against.

[Lui Kang] A sound strategy.

You both made it. Good.

I fear it's only
going to get harder from here.

Whoa. Wait,
what's gonna get harder?

I just fought a walking pair of
teeth on the side of a mountain.

I'm not Tom Cruise,
you know. I act.

I leave that stunt shit
for the stunt people.

Listen, sweetheart,
we should get out of here...

[Sonya grunting]
[groaning] Oh, my... dick.

Fuckballs, no one touches me
without permission, you got it?

Got it.

You said you knew
where we were?

I do.

But it will be dark soon.

We need to make camp. Rest.

Agreed.

[screaming in distance]

No, no. Don't wait for me.
I'm fine.

Let me just pee out
some blood first.

[grunting in pain]


[Black Dragon soldier
shivering]

[bones breaking]
[Black Dragon soldier groans]

What the fuck?

I think I'm
gonna be sick. [retching]

[Johnny coughs, vomits]

Stay behind me.
I'll take care of this.

What is this, 1950?

Step back, Bruce Lee.
Bring it, bitch.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
everyone just chillax, okay?

No one needs to fight anyone.

Especially some guy
that just went psycho

on a bunch of, uh...

Black Dragon. Mercenaries.

Assassins. Bad guys.

Yeah, those guys.

We have to continue.

Once Mortal Kombat
has been declared,

it must be finished.

Did you declare Mortal Kombat?

Did you?
Nope.

What about you, Mister...

Scorpion.

Oh, it's catchy. I like that.

Did you declare Mortal Kombat?

Good. Good. Great!
Then no one needs to die.

Sheesh.

Now, who's hungry?

[Lui Kang] I know you didn't believe
it before, but it's all true.

The elder Gods,
the tournament, everything.

Emperor Shao Kahn has won nine
previous Mortal Kombat tournaments.

If he wins a tenth...

Then what?


Great. Just great.

Yeah. Okay, monsters, magic,
this can't be real.

Somebody must have slipped
something into my drink.

I'm hallucinating.
Get a grip, Johnny.

Whatever this is, it's real.

There's no use sitting around
and whining about it.

If what Lui Kang says is true,

then the whole world
is in trouble,

and we have to stop it.

If I can get to a radio,

a communications array,
I can call in reinforcements.

Turn this island
into the next cautionary tale.

it were that easy.

[Lui Kang] Lord Raiden.
[Scorpion] You.

"If only it were that easy"?

Do you know
what a Hellfire missile can do?

I'm sure it's very powerful
on Earth.

But we are not on Earth.

This island lives in a place
between realms.

A place set aside specifically
for the tournament.

Uh-huh. Sure. Sounds great.

So, if what Lui Kang
says is true,

then you're really
some sort of God, right?

I have been given many names.

Well, shoot, Buddha!

Snap your fingers. Get us home!

I'm done with psycho monsters
and bad food.

And by the way,
I'll never complain

about doing a sequel again
in my life.

He cannot.
Lord Raiden is forbidden

from interfering
in the tournament.

It is a bargain he made
to save Earthrealm

from being taken over eons ago.

Well, that's insane.

The fate of the world
is being decided

by some sort of
karate tournament?

Are you kidding me?

You are the only hope left
for Earthrealm.

Head toward the temple where
your final battles await...

and your destinies
will be made clear.

But be on guard.

There are others on this island

who will try to keep you
from the final round.

Great. So, uh,
we are screwed.

If Lord Raiden believes
we can make it, we can.

No, you can't.

Well, you seem very fun,
Mr. Scorpion.

Shang Tsung has the numbers.

He has that... monster.

Go. Hide in the jungle
until it is over.

And let Earth be destroyed?

Sorry, pal.
I took an oath to defend it,

no matter the odds.

He would not understand, Sonya.

Someone such as him,

has never known anything
worth dying for.

You cannot survive.

My will is strong.
My destiny is my own.

You are as naive,
as you are doomed.

I have waited here too long.

Know that the next time
we meet, it will not end well.

Well, that was cheery.

Shut up, botox.

I'm just sayin', he really
killed the vibe around here.

I was just... [groaning]

Shutting up. Yep.
[continues groaning]

Scorpion was right about
one thing,

we've rested long enough.

We must continue on.

I've found them.


now what?

Oh, great. This is fair.

The rules state
that it must be single combat.

for the tournament.

They've been paid to kill you.

Hello, love.
Nice to see you again. Mwah.

Why don't you come over here
and I'll give you a hug?

Well, you'd do a better job
than Jax.

I guess Raiden was wrong.

Oh, you think?
No, stay together.

We'll survive. We have to.

Yeah, we better.

I need to make it home,
so I can kill my agent.

Be ready.
For what?

[gun cocking]
[groans]

Aah!


[all grunting, groaning]

You see? I knew he liked us.

[Sonya grunts]

[Johnny grunts]

[all grunting]
[Sonya] Stay down!

I know how to fight...
[Sonya grunts, yells]

[all groaning]

Sure you do. Just stay down.

Oh, man, is she hot!



[guns cocking]

[muffled heartbeats]

[gun clicks]

[muffled gunshots]

[Lui Kang grunting rapidly]

[continues grunting]

[Black Dragon soldier groans]

[Lui Kang grunting]

[Black Dragon soldier groans]


[Lui Kang yells]

[Lui Kang grunts]

[all grunting]

[soldiers straining]


Down!


[Johnny gasps]

[laughing wickedly]

Huh? What gives?

You dishonor this tournament.

[Sub-Zero grunts]
[Kano screams]

[Sub-Zero groans]

You will die for what you did!



[both grunting]


[Scorpion grunts]

[Sub-Zero groans]



This is for my wife!

[Sub-Zero grunts]

And this is for my son.

[Scorpion screams]

[Sub-Zero straining]


Screw it. He's not
paying me enough for this.


Go, save your partner.


Partner?

Raiden said your
destiny would be clear.

So, there she is.

You know what, I guess I don't
mind having my balls crushed.

By her, I mean.

Doesn't make it any better.

[portal opens]

[Quan Chi] I'm disappointed.

I brought you here
for one purpose.

And you have failed me.

You're as weak
as your wife was.

As your child.

Yes, you fool.

It wasn't Sub-Zero at all.

I killed them.

<i>It was easy.</i>

<i>I used sorcery
to hide my identity.</i>

<i>To make the Lin Kuei
do as I wanted.</i>

You are strong, Scorpion.

But not immortal.

I think I'll leave you here.

Just like I left your son.

To be eaten by the birds.

[portal opens]

it needs help.</i>

the scorpion is feared?</i>

<i>Its will.</i>

[Scorpion gasps]

[Scorpion straining]

[men screaming
[Sonya grunts]


Just a bit further.

Jax.
Sonya?

I'm so glad you made it.

It's gonna be a joy

to watch you end up
like your partner.

[gears turning]

[creatures growling]

You think I'm afraid of you?

Bring it on.

[Sonya grunting]

[panting]
[creature growling]

Fuck.

Shang Tsung.

Ah, I'm impressed, Raiden.

You were right.

He has great spirit.

And even greater skill.

Please, we both know
yours is a lost cause.

Goro!



I'll make you a deal, Lui Kang.

Yield, and Shao Kahn
will grant you mercy.

You can come to Outworld.

Live as a king.

We shall show you
every pleasure.

Is that how Shao Kahn
got you to betray your world?

I am not as weak
as you, Shang Tsung.

Then you shall die.

Fight!

[grunts, growling]

[both grunting]

[Lui Kang] Whoo! Oh.
[grunts]


[both grunting]




It must be awful

to watch your beloved
chosen one die,

and be unable
to do anything about it.

The fight is not over yet.

It may as well be.

Quan Chi, goblets.

Let us toast to our Emperor's
impending victory.

Splendid idea.

[wine sizzles]

[both grunting]

Now, Lui Kang,
you can do better than that.

[Lui Kang and Goro grunting]

For Outworld.

For Shao Kahn.

[grunts]
[Sonya grunts]

[Sonya groans, grunts]

[Sonya groans]


[demons growling]

[Sonya grunts]

[Sonya panting]

[Johnny Cage] Here's Johnny.

Argh!
[demon grunts]

[Sonya groans]

[upbeat music playing]
Johnny?

Don't worry, babe. I got this.

[demon growling]

[Johnny grunts]

All right, boys.

Picture's up, roll sound.

[confused growling]

And action!

[demons growling]
[Johnny grunting]

[demon squeals]

[Johnny grunting]
[demon groaning]

Impossible.

Holy shit.

Johnny Cage can fight.


[Sonya grunts]

I told you, you'd come around.

Ugh...
[demon roaring]

Ha!

[both grunting]

[Johnny] Eat it.
[both grunting]

[Lui Kang grunting]

[Goro grunting]

[Goro growls]

[Lui Kang grunting]

[Goro growling]

[Goro roars]

[Lui Kang grunting]

[Goro groans]

[Shang Tsung] Well done.

Truly, I underestimated you.

But...

I am bored now.

Goro, play time is over.

[Goro grunts]


[Goro grunts]

[Lui Kang grunting]

[both grunting]

[Lui Kang] Aah!

[Lui Kang grunting]

[demon groans]
[both grunting]

Kano!

Stay back!

I'll slit his throat.
[Jax groans]

[Kano groans]
[Jax growls]

[Kano grunts]

[Sonya grunts]

[Sonya grunts]


[Kano grunts]

[Sonya groans]

[Sonya grunts]

[Kano groans]

[Jax groans]

Wait a minute.

[Kano groaning]

[Jax grunts]
[bone crunching]

Now we can go.

Aah!

[muffled grunting]

[both grunting]

[Goro growling]
[Lui Kang groaning]


[both grunting]

Yes. Yes.

You see, Quan Chi,
the key to winning

is always being a few steps
ahead of your enemies.


Did you think I didn't know

you'd betray your Emperor,
Quan Chi?

You're mistaken.
I would never...


[groaning]
[Shang Tsung] All for what?

This?

He's been imprisoned
for a reason, Quan Chi.

Your sad devotion
to the mad God Shinnok,

makes you as pathetic as he is.
[groaning]

Soon, Earthrealm will be
Shao Kahn's,

and his destiny
will be complete.

It's too bad you won't live
long enough to see it.


Finish him.

[Lui Kang groaning]

[Lui Kang straining]

[Lui Kang groaning]
[Goro laughing]

Does it hurt?

[Lui Kang screams]


[Lui Kang screaming]

Soon, your weak species
will be no more.

[Goro grunts]


Who dares?

Scorpion.

Impossible.

It would seem I underestimated
your champion, Quan Chi.

You are Scorpion
of Netherrealm, yes?

You have killed Goro.

Thus you must take
your rightful place

as the champion of Outworld.

I want nothing to do
with your game.

I've come for him.

[Shang Tsung laughs]

Interesting.

Defeat Lui Kang,

and you can have Quan Chi
to do with as you wish.

Defeat Lui Kang,

and my emperor will give you
all that you dream of.

Vengeance is not the way,
Scorpion.

Of course it is,

and it's yours.

All you have to do

is kill him.

[Lui Kang panting]


[Shang Tsung] Good.

Good.

What choice did he
really have, Lord Raiden?

There's always
another choice.

Now. Fight.


Living for the future.

Give me the key.
[Shang Tsung grunts]

You fool.

Shao Kahn will hear about this

and kill you.
I'm already dead.

Lui Kang.

I yield.
No. [groans]

Then the tournament
is finished.

Outworld has lost.

Earthrealm is safe.


I will kill you all.

The tournament is over,
Shang Tsung.

I am no longer bound
by rules of non-interference.

Return to your Emperor.

Tell him of your failure.

You have made a mistake,
Lord Raiden.

Emperor Shao Kahn
will have his revenge.

I'm counting on it.

No.

Without Shang Tsung's power,

the island will collapse.

We must go.

What about Scorpion?

His path lies elsewhere.

But...
Now.

I knew you would survive.

I chose you for a reason.

Give me the key

and we can leave this place
before it is destroyed.


Like you did my family.

Very well. But please,

put up more of a fight
than your wife did.

[Scorpion screams]

[both grunt]

[Scorpion grunting]

[Quan Chi grunting]

[Quan Chi grunting]

[Scorpion groans]

I'm going to finish the job
my demons couldn't.

Die,

you wretched vermin.
[Scorpion gasping]

[Scorpion groaning]

[Scorpion grunts]

[bone cracking]


Indeed. [growls]

[both grunting]

[grunting, roars]

[distant explosion]

[Lui Kang grunts]

Lui, Lord Randy. Need a lift?


[Scorpion grunting]

[Scorpion roars]


[bone crunching]


[both grunting]

[Scorpion growling]


[Scorpion grunts]

[Quan Chi groaning]




[Quan Chi screams]

[Quan Chi groans]

[bones crunching]


[Scorpion] Get over here.
[groans]

My God will avenge me.

Damn your God.



So, is that it?

Did we win?
For now.

All right! Yeah!

Uh... May I?

[Johnny Cage]
All right, yeah. Mmm.

Hmm, cinnamon.

Mmm, yeah, pat me there.

Doesn't mean I'm gonna
break the hug.

That's enough.
[Johnny] Okay.

Think she'll ever like me?

She didn't hit you in the nuts,
did she?

Yes, she did, Jax.
Yes, she did.

I have failed you.

I could not defeat Goro.

If it wasn't for Scorpion...

Failed? No.

Your destiny was never
to defeat Goro, Lui Kang.

It was to defeat Shao Kahn.

[Shang Tsung groaning]

[Shao Kahn] You have failed me.

I'm sorry, Master.

It was that old fool, Raiden.

He...
[Shao Kahn] Silence!

Gather our forces.

It's time to end this game...

once and for all.
