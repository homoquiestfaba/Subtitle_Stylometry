Hey baby, hey...

LADY: Over here.

That'â€™s it, I'm going home.

LADY: Hey baby.

I'â€™ve never seen anything
so slow.

Six and a half hours
and all I got was

two of my regulars,
and some guy

who rolled down his window
and asked for directions.

Ooh, I'â€™ve got a chill baby.

You want to warm me up?

Paco?

OPERATOR: 911

Yeah, get the police.

[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]

ANNOUNCER: And, clear please.

ANNOUNCER: Going into one fall,
one fall.


ANNOUNCER: That'â€™s it for
the ladies.


[MUSIC PLAYING]


I got a run in my stocking.

TINA: It was terrible,
it was terrible.

Hi.

TINA: Hey, where you going?

I'â€™ll be back in a minute.

Okay, well, bundle up.
It'â€™s cold.


[GUN COCKING]

Huh!


[GUN FIRES]

[DOOR, OPENING]

MAN: Call 911!

CARELLA: What do we got?COP: Name'â€™s Sully Anderson

COP: Prettiest girl I'â€™ve ever
seen, dead.

MEYER: Still in her costume.

Why'â€™s she out here
doing her show?

You were meeting somebody,
weren'â€™t you?

CARELLA: Someone
you didn'â€™t want
coming backstage.

You know, some day one of these
stiffs is going to get up
and answer you.

Anybody see anything?

Nothing.

Some of the other cast members
are waiting inside.

Okay boys, let'â€™s get that gurney
in here and get her out of here.

MEYER: That'â€™s them, right?CARELLA: Yeah.

Hi, my name is Meyer. This is
Detective Carella.

Uh, I can'â€™t believe it.
I can'â€™t believe it.

Why would anyone
want to hurt Sally?

So you don'â€™t have any idea
who did this?

No, everybody liked her.

Not everybody.

Want to show us
her dressing room?

There was a guy,

hanging around
the backstage doors.

And she told me that he
followed her a couple of times.

Did you ever see him?

Yeah. He'â€™s tall, dark,

very thin. Crazy eyes.

We need you to come down
to the precinct.

Look at some pictures.
See if you can ID. this guy.

Come over here for a second.
I want to talk to you.

Was she in any kind of trouble?
I need to know.

None.

TINA: Why are you looking at me
like that?CARELLA: Like what?

Like I'â€™m lying.

It'â€™s my natural expression.

She sat right down there.

TINA: Right beside me.

TINA: She was always laughing.

Which one'â€™s her locker?

That one right there.

Did Sally have a boyfriend?

Yeah, Tim Moore.
He'â€™s a med student.

This guy?

Uh-huh.

They live together.

Anybody contact him?

TINA: No.

MEYER: We'â€™ll take care of it.

You know, there'â€™s always
guys hanging around here.

TINA: They'â€™re usually harmless.

Not this time.

MEYER: Think she'â€™s as sweet as
everybody says she was.

CARELLA: Is anybody?

You have
a very negative attitude,

do you know that?

You'â€™ve noticed?

It'â€™s hard to believe
nobody heard anything.

CARELLA: Must'â€™ve been
a good show.

COP: Yeah, 11:38.

Copy that.

CIVILIAN: I live in Brooklyn.
You know that'â€™s a long way away.

COP: Thank you. Anyway you can
help me?

[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

[KNOCK AT DOOR]

You forget your key Sal?

[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

MEYER: Tim Moore?TIM: Yeah.

This is Detective Carella.
My name is Meyer.

MEYER: Can we come in?

Yeah, sure.

Would you mind
turning that down
a little bit?

Did the uh... neighbors
complain about the music again?

I get so used to it,
I don'â€™t even realize.

Thanks.

How long have you been home?

All night.

What'â€™s this about?

I'â€™m afraid we have some
bad news.

Sally Anderson was
killed tonight.

MEYER: Around 9:15.

No!

There must be some sort
of mistake. You see,
that couldn'â€™t happen.

She'â€™d be on stage at the show.

It happened in the alley
behind the theater.

She was murdered.


CARELLA: Can you help us out?
Do you know of anyone
who could'â€™ve done this?


She was complaining about
this freak,

who was hanging around
the stage door...

trying to talk to her.

Yeah, we know about him.

It was really starting to
scare her, you know.

If she was afraid of him,
why would she go outside
to meet him?

Who said she was going out
to meet somebody?

I do.

I hadn'â€™t been spending enough
time with her lately.

I was so busy getting ready
for finals.

I had so much catching up to do
and now, it'â€™s for nothing.

Did you have any visitors?
Talk to anyone tonight?

I was back and forth
on the phone with Karl.

We'â€™re studying
for the same final.

Karl who?

Karl Loeb ah...

L-O-E-B.

TIM: 555-0164.

We must'â€™ve talked
about a dozen times.

When can I see her?

We'â€™ll let you know,

as soon as the medical examiner
releases the body.

Tim, this is uh...
my card.

When you'â€™re feeling up to it,
give me a call,
we'â€™ll get together.

Yeah.

I'â€™m sorry.

[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

MEYER: So why don'â€™t you
trust him?

CARELLA: When was the last time
anyone told us
the entire truth?

MEYER: Yeah, well, his alibi is
going to check out. He knows
we'â€™ll verify it.

CARELLA: So we wait a couple of
days. We bring him in.

And then we really
get to know him.

PRISONER: I was hanging out
there, that'â€™s all.

COP: Oh, man, we caught you
with your hand
in the cookie jar okay!

You can do this song and dance
as long as you like, alright.

COP: Right over here.

ANGIE: You'â€™re crazy. Who's going
to pay good money to be with
a woman in my condition?

PARKER: Maybe that'â€™s a turn on
on to some guys.

Look, it'â€™s my ninth month.

The gypsy says it'â€™s going to
be a girl.

You'â€™ll probably have her walking
the streets in a few years.

You shouldn'â€™t say that mister.

Nothing like that is ever going
to happen to her. She will never
have that kind of life.

MEYER: Hey, Andy.PARKER: What?

Why don'â€™t you give her a break?
Either write her up
Or, let her go.

[PHONE RINGING]

Hey, Kling, what do you think?
Should I let her walk?

Whatever.

DETECTIVE: Morning.
Okay how'â€™s this?

CARELLA: Tell me about Tim.

When I get stuck I call Tim.
He usually knows the answers.

And a couple of times
he called me.

What'â€™s that mean? A couple?

LOEB: I... really couldn'â€™t
tell you.

After eight Or, nine hours
of studying, I get kind of
punchy.

I even called him
a couple of times
just so I wouldn'â€™t fall asleep.

Maybe you did fall asleep
for a while. Lost track of time?

LOEB: No, I use coffee
to keep me up. And he'â€™s
got that damn music.

CARELLA: Did you know Sally?

He didn'â€™t tell you?
I went out with her
before he did.

I mean it'â€™s not like I
got anywhere with her but...

Yeah, I know. She was just
an old fashioned girl.

BROWN: Hey Kling, meet
Detective Burke from
Special Forces.

She'â€™s been assigned to give us
a hand staking out
the laundromats.

EILEEN: Nice change of pace,
actually.

Usually the perp is out to
rape me. This guy only wants to
steal my panties.

Oh, no-no-no-no he'â€™ll take your
watch and your wallet first.

That'â€™s his business.
The panties
are just pleasure.

EILEEN: Mm-hmm.

KLING: Yeah, he'â€™s hit five
laundromats in a row. We think
we got a pattern established.

Always a Monday Or, a
Tuesday night.

This is probably
our best shot, here.

Uh, I'â€™m done with it.
You might enjoy it.

What was that all about?

Model on the front cover
is Kling'â€™s ex-wife.

He can'â€™t pick up a magazine
or, look at a commercial
without seeing her face.


ANGIE: Aah! My water broke.


No, no! I can'â€™t walk.

Rapid, rapid contractions.

Rapid... rapid...

EILEEN: Help me get her
in the car.


Yeah, this is Meyer.
Get a doctor, up to the
second floor.

CARELLA: They teach you anything
about delivering babies?

LOEB: No! I just...


LOEB: Get me some towels.EILEEN: Towels!

[PHONE RINGING]

[PHONE RINGING]

Yeah, Byrnes.


Ahh, ahh! What a place
to be born.

I swear to God, she'â€™ll never
be back

in a police station again
as long as she lives.

Paramedics are on their
way okay, so you just hold on.

I can'â€™t wait!
I can'â€™t wait!

You'â€™re doing great.
I'â€™m right here with you.

Just relax.

What'â€™s your name?

Angie.

Hi, hi, Angie.

Look hm...
my wife and I, we'â€™ve
been through this twice.

MEYER: And it, it... was
a... a piece of cake.

Just relax.

Uhh!

Look, I want you to
hold my hand okay.

Just hold my hand.
Hold my hand.

MEYER: Squeeze tight, alright.

Just breathe. When you get
the contractions, just breathe.

Here'â€™s a head. I can see
the head Angie. Haha.

LOEB: Here it comes.MEYER: Push Angie.


Aah! Aah!

Angie, you got yourself
a baby girl.


That was easy. Aah!


[BABY CRYING]

You did it. Ha-ha.

Aw, hey baby.


Now, Meyer, Carella...

I hate to distract you two,
but I just got a call
from ballistics.

The bullet that killed
our chorus girl

was fired from the same gun
as the one that killed

Paco Lopez, up in Diamondback.

Who the hell is Paco Lopez?

Small time pimp and gram dealer.
A real low life.

When did this Paco get his?

Apparently sometime
late yesterday afternoon.

Right between the eyes,
at close range.

Find the connection.
And find it quick.

CARELLA: We'â€™ve only
been on this
12 hours.

MEYER: Hey Lieutenant, you know
we just delivered a baby.
It'â€™s a girl.

Many happy returns.
Just get going.

Meyer, girl'â€™s very specific.
Think this may help you.

Oh, thanks Joe. Look...

Do me a favor. Give us a couple
hundred copies of these.

We'â€™ll pass them around
the theater district.

MEYER: We'â€™re going to need all
the help we can get on this one.SKETCH ARTIST: You got it.

MALE FAN: Yo Johnny!

Johnny! Johnny just...
just one Johnny.

Please! Just one. Johnny...

Ugh!

MEYER: Who was that guy?

MALE FAN: That'â€™s Johnny Manwick.
He'â€™s in town for a big concert
tonight.

MEYER: Oh, Oh.

MALE FAN: Hey, you anybody?
MEYER: Nah, nah.

Listen you good at recognizing
famous faces?

Yeah, that'â€™s what I do.

Maybe you can ID.
this famous mug.

Him? What are you, nuts?

That'â€™s Krieger,
Howie Krieger.

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

MEYER: Howard?

Open up. It'â€™s the police.

Howard, come on. We want to
ask you a couple of questions.

[WINDOW OPENS]

MEYER: It'â€™s open.

MEYER: I'â€™ll cover the front.CARELLA: I'â€™m on him.

Hold it. Hold it!


Ugh, I don'â€™t believe this!

MEYER: Uh-uh, whoa, whoa!

CARELLA: What? What?

What, are you crazy?
Too far down.

MEYER: We'â€™ll get him
another day.

MEYER: We'â€™ll get him
another day.

CARELLA: We'â€™ll get him
another day.

I can'â€™t take heights. That's why
I didn'â€™t become a fireman.

CARELLA: Okay.MEYER: Come on. Let'â€™s go.
Let'â€™s go.

COP: Can I have a
building number please?

COP: What did you find out?

JACOBS: What did the neighbors
say? You hear anything?

MEYER: Hey, Jacobs. How are you?JACOBS: What the hell are you
doing here?

CARELLA: I'â€™m sure you got the
same ballistics report we did.

JACOBS: That doesn'â€™t mean
anything. This slime Lopez was
killed first.

We got full jurisdiction over
both homicides.

Captain Frick doesn'â€™t think so.
He sees this Sally Anderson
thing as a high profile case,

going to get a lot of
media attention.

MEYER: So he turned it over
to the 8-7.

CARELLA: It wasn'â€™t our call,
Jake.JACOBS: That'â€™s crap.

I'â€™m not taking it. You take a
walk, both of you.

We'â€™re not going anywhere.
You want to make something out
of it, you go right ahead.

MEYER: Hey Jake, this is between
you and the captain, you know.
Leave us out of it.

I think one of his own hookers
nailed him. There'â€™s one in the
bedroom.

CARELLA: I hear he was dealing
coke.JACOBS: Only higher than a mule.

From what this Quadrano girl
told us,

he had maybe a dozen
regular customers.

Names?

You want to run the case?

You'â€™re on your own.

[CLEARING THROAT]

How you doing?

I'â€™m Detective Carella.

I already told them
everything I know.

I know, but I'â€™m new here.
So would you mind,
starting over.

He had me out
hitting the bricks
all night.

He didn'â€™t care
if I froze my ass off.

He didn'â€™t care
nothing about me.

Okay.

Then why'â€™re you so upset?

Because I don'â€™t know
where I'â€™m going to go.

The super already wants to know
when the furniture is going out.

How many other girls
was Paco working?

Nobody messed with Paco.

MEYER: Yeah, I noticed.

Do you know this woman?

Who is she?

She was shot with the same gun
that killed Paco.

Well, Paco never got near
anything as classy as her.

How about this guy?
Ever see him?

That face I'â€™d remember.
Weird eyes.


Can you tell me where to find
some of Paco'â€™s girls?

None of them killed him.
They wouldn'â€™t have had
the nerve.

Did you ever think about
killing him?

Yeah.

Yeah, I thought about it plenty.

And then I would think about...

...even if,

you get away with it,

where will you go?

I'â€™ll tell you
what I'â€™m going to do.

I'â€™m going to talk to the super,

and I'â€™m going to tell him
to lay off.

So you don'â€™t worry about it.

I never had a cop
be so nice to me before.

Well, now you have.

How can I help you?

Well, you could write down
the names of some of
Paco'â€™s girls,

and where they hang out.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Looks like you owe me
65 big ones, Father.

ANTHONY: It'â€™s Brother.
Brother Anthony.

DIGANGI: Really? Here I thought
you were Friar Tuck.

EMMA: That was the Lord'â€™s money
you appropriated.

DIGANGI: Really? Well, here'â€™s a
dollar for your collection.

God bless you.

Now why don'â€™t you pick it up
and hand it to me?

Why don'â€™t you go to hell?

EMMA: Better yet, pick it up
with your teeth.

EMMA: Pick it up! Pick it up
with your teeth.

I see a wonderful shot.

Lloyd!

LLOYD: Say Jack, step off man!

I think he'â€™d want you
to have this.


BROTHER ANTHONY: Two more
margaritas.

Hold the salt. It'â€™s bad
for my water retention.

BROTHER ANTHONY: Hey, hey.
Hang on. Hang on.

Tell her the one you told me
this morning.

What does a bimbo put behind
her ears to attract men?

What?

Her ankles.

[LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY]

She should be doing stand-up.

Aww.[LAUGHS]


MEYER: How you doing?

Ever hear of Carol Ann Quinn?

WAITRESS: Yeah, sure.
She used to table dance here.

Just not lately.

How about her friend,
Paco Lopez?

Yeah, Paco'â€™s in and out of here
all the time.

MEYER: Not anymore. Didn'â€™t
you hear? He got shot.

It'â€™s no great loss.

How about this guy?
Ever see him?

No.

I see a familiar face.

Don'â€™t we know each other?

Hi, Emma Forbes.

Weren'â€™t you married to
somebody named Fast Jimmy?

CARELLA: Big! Six foot four,
black dude.

Used to have a thing about
savings and loans.

I don'â€™t recall being married
to anybody like that.

CARELLA: Do you know, you'â€™d be
a widow now?

Since he got blown away, by some
old security guard
down at United Thrift.

Tragic story.

CARELLA: Tragic for the
security guard too...

because two weeks later he'â€™s out
walking his dog, and he got his
throat cut.

Now I'â€™ve got a question
for you, Detective.

How does a bimbo turn on
the lights, after sex?

Okay. How?

She opens the car door.


She is funnier than Rosanne.


What are you made up for?

EMMA: This is Brother Anthony,
of the Justinian Order.

We have much in common,
Detective.

We both seek out sinners,
to mend their ways.

How about a recently deceased
pusher named Paco Lopez?

Do you know him
Or, any of his girls?

I hope he made his peace
with God.

Well, if you hear anything,
I'â€™d be appreciative.

People do unburden themselves
to me from time to time.

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

Do you know what that means?

No. Do you?

Yeah, but why should
I tell you?

MEYER: Paco used to run
some girls out of here

but he lost interest when he
started dealing some
high quality cocaine.

We'â€™ve got about six other places
to hit. I hope you don'â€™t have
any other plans.

Well, I wanted to get a present
for Teddy.

Oh, that'â€™s right. It's a year
you'â€™re together.

CARELLA: Yeah, can you
believe it?

I knew that creep would get it
one of these days.

You know,

Paco'â€™s demise may have opened
a doorway of opportunity.

How so?

With a degree of persuasion,

we might be able to get our
hands on his list of clients.

BROTHER ANTHONY: Maybe even
figure out who'â€™s supplying him.

After all,

someone has to service that
poor, deprived clientÃ¨le.

[LAUGHS MISCHIEVOUSLY]

[GLASSES CLINK]

PARKER: You know,
I was wondering...

Did you get the alimony? I mean
because you'â€™re entitled to it,
you know.

KLING: Do you ever
think about anything
except my divorce?

Do you?

One more crack and you'â€™re going
through that windshield.


KLING: Keep an eye on the
laundromat.


PANTY BANDIT: Look at me!
All of you!

Alright, okay.

Now I don'â€™t want to have to
repeat myself.

Get away from the window.
Now move it to the back!

Let'â€™s go! You get out of there.
Get to the back.

Come on. Okay now,

I want your money, credit cards,
wrist-watches, rings right now.

You, get the bag.

I can'â€™t believe this.

Don'â€™t forget your earrings.

Yeah, okay.

PANTY BANDIT: Get the necklace
off. Hurry up.

It'â€™s just costume jewelery.

Put it in the bag!

Now...

the panties.

What?

Take... off your panties.

No sir. Won'â€™t do
no such thing.

I got to take off my boots
and then my jeans.

BLACK LADY: And no way
I plan on standing here naked.

Just do what I say.

[GUN COCKING]

Take mine.

What?

Leave her alone.
Take my panties.

Reach under my skirt.

Rip off my panties.

Are you ready to go now?

Oh, come on babe. I'â€™m sorry.
I'â€™m sorry...

Parker!

[GUN COCKING]

Your turn to drop something.

[GUN FIRES]

PANTY BANDIT: [GROANING]

KLING: Police! Everybody
stay back.PARKER: Whoa.

KLING: Stay back!

EILEEN: What the hell
happened?

Didn'â€™t you see him come in?

You were supposed to
be watching.

Maybe I got distracted.

You'â€™re are a jerk.
And you'â€™re dangerous.

You almost got her killed.

PARKER: Hey, everything
is alright.EILEEN: No thanks to you.

KLING: Okay guys.
Thanks a lot.

PARKER: Thanks.

I think this belongs to you.

Thank you. My good luck.

Always wear these on stake-outs.

You get a reward.

KLING: A reward?EILEEN: Mm-hmm.

How about lunch tomorrow?
Chen Trou. My treat.

For, an earring?

What do I get for
shooting the guy?

Dessert.

[DOOr, OPENS]

One year.

I'â€™ve been thinking about it
all day.

CARELLA: Yeah?

You got a surprise for me, huh?

Okay. Where is it?

CARELLA: It'â€™s perfect.

I love it.

I love you too.

Let 'â€™s make it our anniversary,
again tomorrow night, okay?

CARELLA: We'â€™ll go out for a
big evening.

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

JUDITE: What do you want?

We'â€™ve come about
the funeral arrangements.

We just need a suit of clothes
to bury Paco in.

JUDITE: What'â€™s the scam?

I can'â€™t afford no funeral.

The church will look after that.

You'â€™re a religious girl.
Aren'â€™t you?

BROTHER ANTHONY: I bet you went
to catechism.

Yeah, till... till I was 12.

Hmm, it'â€™s uh...

cold out here.

Can'â€™t we come in?

I don'â€™t care.

Go look in the closet. He'â€™s got
a bunch of nice suits and ties
in there.

I'â€™m sure we'll find
what we need.

[DOOr, CREAKS]

Paco wasn'â€™t very religious.

BROTHER ANTHONY: That'â€™s why
we have to pray even harder
for him. Kneel down.

Which church did you say
you were from? [YELLS]

BROTHER ANTHONY: We also have to
pray for Paco'â€™s
misguided customers.

All of those deprived people
he was dealing to.

I don'â€™t know anyone okay.
He didn'â€™t tell me anything
about his business.

Oh, come on sweetheart.
There'â€™s got to be a list here
somewhere.

Or, else you'â€™ve got it
in your head.

If I knew, I would
tell you!

JUDITE: Please, please, please!
Please. Aah!

I... I can'â€™t
tell you who he sold it to.

I can only tell you where
he got it from.

There, that'â€™s a beginning,
isn'â€™t it?

He started getting this
real high grade stuff from her
about three Or, four months ago.

EMMA: Her?

This pretty blonde girl
he was screwing around with.

She was a dancer from that
big stage musical.

The one that was in all the
newspapers?

Yeah, her.

Did you tell this to the police?

No! No, I didn'â€™t say nothing,
okay.

JUDITE: I swear! I didn'â€™t want
to get involved.

Where did she live?

How will I know?

You don'â€™t want to put us to
all the trouble

of going down to some theater
just to get an address, do you?


BROTHER ANTHONY: Seems that
I was wrong.

It seems that kindness isn'â€™t
the way after all.

I would, I would tell you
if I knew. I swear!

I swear!

I'â€™m sure you can convince Emma
of that.

JUDITE: You don'â€™t want to
hurt me okay. All I know is

that she was running around
on her boyfriend.


EMMA: Where is the list?
Tell me!

[PHONE RINGING]

[KNOCK AT DOOR]

KLING: You wanted to see me?
BYRNES: Oh, morning, Bert.
Come in, come in. Sit down.

BYRNES: Here, help yourself.

My sister-in-law sends me
a box of chocolates.

She knows I am on a diet.

BYRNES: Caramels are on
the end.

Uh, no thanks. I don'â€™t want to
ruin my lunch.

Good job last night,
at that laundromat.

Detective Burke deserves
the credit.

She'â€™s good.

I got a report from uh...
Grossman in the lab.

He examined the handbag
belonging to Sally Anderson.

KLING: The chorus girl?BYRNES: Yes.

And there'â€™s a residue of cocaine
at the bottom of the bag.

Very high grade merchandise.
Not your ordinary street stuff.

I thought Carella and Meyer
were working that case?

Here'â€™s some photos from the
"Fatback" opening night party.

Cast, crew, load of VIPs.

BYRNES: Kind of party
where coke might turn up.

BYRNES: The uh... blonde on the
far left, that'â€™s Sally Anderson.

You recognize the woman
she'â€™s talking to?

You know that'â€™s my ex-wife.

You talk to her lately?

No.

I'â€™m asking a personal favor.

Drop in on your ex and
inquire about the party.

BYRNES: If any drugs were being
circulated. Particularly if
Sally was handing any out.

If she was using,
she might also
have been dealing.

Do you mind if I
think it over?

BYRNES: She'â€™s doing a photoshoot
at Isola Center from 9:30 on,

just in case
you'â€™re in the neighborhood.

LADY: Taxi.

MAN: Tony. [WHISTLES]

Howard.

MEYER: Howard!

MEYER: Watch it!

CAR DRIVER: Out of the street,
you moron!

Get him,
get him.

[TIRES SCREECHING]

[HORN TOOTING]

MEYER: What did you run for
Howard? Come on.

[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]

PHOTOGRAPHER: That'â€™s it.
Beautiful, beautiful.

PHOTOGRAPHER: Closer together.
Closer together.

Now look towards me.
Fantastic. Fantastic.

PHOTOGRAPHER: Yes. Yes.
Just like that.

PHOTOGRAPHER: Ooh, beautiful.
Beautiful.

PHOTOGRAPHER: Keep it moving,
keep it moving.

Alan, can I just
have a minute?

ALAN: Sure.AUGUSTA: Thank you.

This is a pleasant surprise.

I probably should'â€™ve called.

Oh, no, no I like it
better this way.

This isn'â€™t a social call.

I'â€™m disappointed.

This is a photo taken at
the opening night party
of Fatback.

You'â€™re in it.

And?

So is Sally Anderson.

Is that what this is about?

You knew her?

Not well.


Is there any reason
we can'â€™t be friends?

I can think of one.


Was Sally Anderson
dealing coke at that party?

And naturally I'â€™d be someone
who'â€™d know right?

KLING: Augusta, wait.
This is important.

A few people were doing lines
at the party

but I never saw Sally
handing out anything.

She had something
better going on.

What was that?

Ice.

I don'â€™t know what that means.

Look, there are people who will
pay almost anything for tickets

to a hit like Fatback.

The very best seats
get sold under the table.

six hundred,
a thousand dollars
a pair.

AUGUSTA: It can add up
to millions.

All tax free.

Sally delivered and collected
cash from scalpers.

I know because I wanted tickets
and had to go through her
to get them.

That doesn'â€™t mean she wasn't
dealing coke too.

That I wouldn'â€™t know.

I better let you go now.

Thanks.

Bert...

I'â€™m not seeing anyone.

[PHONE RINGING]

I didn'â€™t mean to run. I just
didn'â€™t want to fight anybody.

Well, we don'â€™t want to
fight you, Howard.

Just want to ask you
a couple questions.

About Sally?

MEYER: Yeah.

I just like to wait outside
and talk to her.

I'â€™ve seen the show 42 times.

HOWARD: Just the second act.
That was the best part.

What happened Howard?

[PHONE RINGING]

I got there late.

Otherwise I would'â€™ve been
waiting to sneak in.

I would'â€™ve seen
who did it to her.

Where were you?


Ugh, some kids beat me up.

A policeman chased them
but they got away.

HOWARD: They'â€™re like a gang,
you know?

HOWARD: They'â€™re always taking
my money and throwing
my magazines in the gutter.

I'â€™m sorry she died.

Yeah. [SARCASTICALLY]

[PHONE RINGING]

You know we'â€™re going to have to
check this out.

Don'â€™t you, Howard?

KLING: I got something for you
guys on those two homicides.MEYER. Go.

KLING: Ice.

There are already too many
people in this city

who are afraid to go out
after dark.

And then when you have a murder
right outside the theater,

really sends a negative message.

So you were in Philadelphia
at the time of the homicide?

CARTER: Yes, I was.

CARELLA: Philadelphia'â€™s only
an hour train ride away.

Have you got witnesses
to put you there at
nine o'â€™clock?

I was in the rear of
the Majestic Theater

with my staff, taking notes.

We'â€™re trying out
a new comedy.

Unfortunately we'â€™re not going to
be able to bring it in.

Well, that'â€™s too bad. Then
there won'â€™t be any "ice."

CARTER: Pardon me?

CARELLA: Is that word unfamiliar
to you, Mr Carter?

"Ice?"

Look, let'â€™s not waste
each other'â€™s time.

We both know that Sally
was acting as a courier
for your bootleg tickets.

CARTER: I think
I'â€™d better speak
to my lawyer.

You gentleman can leave now.

CARELLA: Sure.

Then we'â€™ll talk to someone
from the IRS.

And then we'â€™ll come back.

CARTER: Look! Humph, come on.

Let'â€™s not make a big issue
out of this, huh?

It'â€™s the old law
of supply and demand. No one
gets harmed by it.

Yeah but seeing as it was
illegal, that would leave
somebody open to blackmail.

CARTER: The way you just
threatened me by invoking IRS.MEYER: Mm-hmm.

CARELLA: Is that what happened
Mr. Carter?

CARELLA: Did Sally threaten to
blow the whistle on you?CARTER: Absolutely not.

The girl took a very modest
commission and never caused me
any trouble at all.

MEYER: What about drugs?
Ever see her do any cocaine?

Never.

I have very strict rules about
the use of drugs in
all of my shows.

MEYER: Admirable.

Of course I can'â€™t vouch for,
what goes on backstage
every night.

Why don'â€™t you ask the gypsies?

You know, the chorus kids.

Oh, they love to tell tales
out of school.

CARELLA: That'â€™s our
very next stop.

CARTER: Well, since you'â€™re going
to the theater you might as well
enjoy the show.

I'â€™d be pleased to offer you
complimentary house seats.

MEYER: Hmm, very nice of you.

My wife and I, we don'â€™t get out
much. Kind of addicted to TV.

But, what about you? You could
take Teddy, for your
anniversary.

Yeah, uhm...

Is it too late to get tickets
for tonight?

CARTER: Not a problem at all.
They'â€™ll be at the box office,
in your name.

I'â€™d have to pay for,
the tickets.

Whatever makes you happy,
Detective.

Please, pay for them.

CARELLA: Let'â€™s say little Sally
needed seed money

to buy all this
high grade stuff.

Shakes down the sleazy producer,

threatens to turn him into
Uncle Sam.

Thereby, acquiring her
venture capital.

Yeah, naturally if Paco
found out he'â€™d try
shaking down Mr. Carter,

giving Carter motive
to kill the both of them.

Smug son of a bitch!

CARELLA: I'â€™d like to nail him.MEYER: Me too.

Mind if I stop by the
art gallery, tell Teddy about
the theater tickets?

Nah, uh...
how does she uh...

get the play? Does she read
the lips?

If we'â€™re sitting close enough.

Otherwise I sign it to her.

You must be getting
pretty good at that, uh?

We communicate better
than people talk out loud.

I guess it'â€™s like
being married
twenty years.

You get inside
each other'â€™s heads.

I never felt so close
to anybody.

CARELLA: Even you.MEYER: Hah.

Thanks.

CARELLA: How you doing?BOX OFFICE MAN: Good.

You got two tickets tonight for
Steve Carella?

BOX OFFICE MAN: Yes.

That'â€™ll be a hundred and fifty
dollars.

For, two tickets?

Seventy five each.

If... if you don'â€™t want them,
I can get a lower price for the
matinÃ©e.

No, no, that'â€™s fine.
You take
plastic right?

Yeah.

MEYER: How much?CARELLA: Hundred and fifty.

Take her to a movie.

MEYER: How you doing?

TINA: Hi.MEYER: You remember me?

Sure. Policeman.

Yeah.

Hey, did you see me on TV
this morning?

No, I missed it.

Oh, that'â€™s okay.

They were interviewing a bunch
of us about the murder.

Mm-hmm.

It'â€™s funny. All these years
I'â€™ve been busting my butt
to get on TV.

And this is how it happens.

Did you tell them about "Ice"?

The little sideline.

Or, were you in that too?

Hey, hey!

CARELLA: Just talk to us.TINA: Look, if someone would'â€™ve
asked me, I would'â€™ve done it.

Would you have also supplied
coke to the cast?


She never made any profit
off that, okay.

She sold it for
exactly what it cost.

If someone asked her, she'â€™d
get it for them
out of friendship.

So you were lying to me, right?

Well, we could get fired
from the show.

Mr. Carter'â€™s really strict.

MEYER: Your friend Sally,
was a real Samaritan.

She'â€™s getting all these drugs.
Giving it to her friends
for cost.

Have you any idea where she got
the drugs from?

I don'â€™t know.

I just know she had it
when anybody needed it.

She buy from a guy named
Paco Lopez? You ever hear
his name?

Never.

Never?

Not that I recall, okay.

MEYER: You ever seen this man
around the theater?

Ever seen him with Sally?

No.

I could tell you
one thing though.

It was really good quality.
I mean it was the best I
ever had.

Ooh, I don'â€™t want to hear this.

TINA: It'â€™s not the kind of stuff
you find on the street.

Can I go?

Yes.

Hey!

Be particularly great tonight.
I'â€™ve got a hundred and fifty
dollars invested.

Don'â€™t make sense partner.

This Paco'â€™s a real zero.

All of a sudden, he'â€™s dealing
high quality stuff.

I hear you.

I'â€™ll be back around three.

You startled me.

What are you doing down here?

EDELMAN: I told you.
I don'â€™t have your goods.

She came and picked up
everything, just like
the last time.

She and some Spanish guy.

MAN IN THE CAR: They'â€™re
both dead.

I read about her.

But, I wasn'â€™t going
to the police.

I can'â€™t say anything.

MAN IN THE CAR: That'â€™s right.
You can'â€™t.

[GUN COCKING]

[GUN FIRES]

BROWN: What do we got?

COP: Well he'â€™s got 265 bucks in
his wallet, plenty of
credit cards.

Name'â€™s Edelman.

Has the family been notified?

COP: His wife'â€™s upstairs in his
office... second floor.


BROWN: Right, yeah.

BROWN: Mrs. Edelman,

did your husband have any
enemies?

MRS. EDELMAN: He was his own
worst enemy.

All those

trips back and forth to
Switzerland and Amsterdam...

he was wearing himself out.

Do you know the combination
to the safe?

My birthday.

Six,

six,

forty two.

Mind if I open it?

Or, if you prefer, we can wait
for a court order.


Why not?
There'â€™s nothing to hide.


Were you aware your husband kept
this much cash?

How much is there?

Well, off hand I'â€™d say uh...

several hundred thousand
dollars.

We never had that kind of money.

[PHONE RINGING]

Got a minute?

Come in.

Detective Eileen Burke,
Detective Cotton Hawes.

HAWES: Heard you did a great job
at the laundromat.EILEEN: Thanks.

Who does your hair?

I got cut by a burglar.

When the stitches came out,
it grew back in like this.

EILEEN: It'â€™s very becoming.HAWES: Why thank you.

Now that we all admire
each other, what can I do
for you?

I heard you still haven'â€™t had
any luck on that park rapist.

HAWES: Had that place staked out
for nine days straight.

I don'â€™t know, maybe it's
too cold for him.

EILEEN: Bad weather never
stopped this creep before.

I'â€™ve been studying his MO.
Let me pitch an idea.

How about I go in
dressed as a nurse?

Don'â€™t tell me you want
a piece of this?

Wasn'â€™t last night
enough excitement?

Hmm, why a nurse?

Because the white uniform
stands out in the dark.

I'â€™ll wear a skirt. Perps like
a leg show.

Hah.

You seem to have a line
on what turns men on.

The weird ones.

Have a piece of candy,
detective.

Ooh, I'â€™d love one.

Hi. Been waiting long?

KLING: No, I just got here.EILEEN: Great.

Cold?

Yeah.

I see you'â€™re still wearing
your lucky earrings.

I'â€™ll need them.

They'â€™ve got me staked out
in Grover Park tonight.

How'â€™d you manage to get in
on that?

I ate three caramels and
an almond cluster.

Oh, you really do want to be the
first woman chief of detectives.
Thank you.

You know, he'â€™s killed
three women with an ice pick.

Can'â€™t wait to meet him.

Where do you keep your gun?

In my handbag.

What about your second gun?

I don'â€™t have one.

KLING: If I were you, I'â€™d get
myself a little .22.

Tuck it in some place with
an easy reach.

All hitmen in The Godfather
pictures, use .22s.

So you'â€™re a big movie fan?

Mmm, that'â€™s my weakness.

I tape everything but I haven'â€™t
got time to watch them.

Yeah, I get 112 channels.

By the time I find something
I like, it'â€™s over.

Alright. [SNICKERS]

Well, here'â€™s to old movies.

The awful ones
are the most fun.

Mmm.

There was one on the other night
with William Powell.

He comes home early from his
business trip

and we know his wife is upstairs
in bed with the chauffeur right?

EILEEN: So on the way up
he finds the guy'â€™s hat.

EILEEN: In 1932, the censors
wouldn'â€™t let them show him
catching her in the sack,

so instead he'â€™s standing there
staring at this dumb hat,
and then he puts...

KLING: I don'â€™t want to
talk about it, alright?

What'â€™s the matter?

I'â€™m sorry, I'm sorry.

I can'â€™t do this.

Hem, excuse me.

MEYER: Hey!ANGIE: How'â€™s it going?

I thought you might like to
see her. All cleaned up, I mean.

CARELLA: She'â€™s precious.ANGIE: Mm-hmm, the doctors said
she'â€™s perfect.

MEYER: Can I hold her?ANGIE: Sure, sure.

MEYER: Aww, man.

MEYER: No doubt about it.

I deliver beautiful babies.

BYRNES: Yeah, okay. Thanks.

Uh, excuse me. I need to see
the both of you.

Hey Lieutenant, look,
she brought the baby back.

Oh, send us a photo. We'â€™ll
put it up on the wall.

CARELLA: Good luck.ANGIE: Thanks.

Well, looks like I got
a serious problem.
I'â€™m sorry Angie.

Well, I... I hate to take up
your time but I was wondering
if you'â€™d consider

being the godfather
to my child.

Aww, that'â€™s...

that'â€™s very sweet Angie but
I don'â€™t think I'm cut out
for that.

No, no, you'â€™re...

you'â€™re a fine man,
Detective Meyer.

ANGIE: I want this little girl
to have a chance, you know.

Well, wha...

what do I have to do?

Well, you just have to

get to know her as she'â€™s
growing up, you know,
be her friend.

Meyer, can we get on with it?

Look, Angie hmm...

This is a big decision. Let me
think about it.

I'â€™ll talk it over with my wife
and I'â€™ll let you know later
okay?

MEYER: But, don'â€™t be upset
if my answer is no.

Well, I got a job

in a beauty parlor,
as a shampoo girl.

Oh, well uh... maybe I'â€™ll get
myself the shampoo.

ANGIE: Ha-ha, no really...

I... I don'â€™t want you to worry
about me,

going back out on the street.

I don'â€™t want this little girl
to be ashamed of me.

I'â€™m sure she won't.

MEYER: I'â€™ll see you later.
You take care alright.ANGIE: Yeah.

MALE COP: Look at this.FEMALE COP: Aww.

Sorry Lieutenant.

Detective.

You questioned Paco Lopez'â€™s
girlfriend? The Quadrano girl?

Yeah! We'â€™re going to
go see her again.

No you aren'â€™t.

Somebody cut her throat!

BYRNES: Oh, boy. First they load
this chorus girl homicide on us

which isn'â€™t even supposed to be
ours and now I'â€™m looking at a
serial killer.

CARELLA: Lieutenant,
she was cut.

The other two were shot.
I think we'â€™ve got
two killers here.

Don'â€™t tell me this doesn't
tie in with the other
two murders.

BROWN: Make that three.

I caught a homicide. A jeweler
named Marvin Edelman.

Ballistics just identified
the bullet.

It was fired from the same .38
that took out Sally and Paco.

MEYER: Great.

At this rate, by next week
half the population of the city
will be dead.

CARELLA: We got a pusher,

a hooker, a dancer,
and a jeweler.
And they'â€™re all strangers.

Except to the killer.

I love this job.

BROWN: Look, Edelman had
five hundred thousand in cash
locked in his safe.

His tax return shows a hundred
and twenty five per.

There'â€™s no accounting for
that kind of money.

MEYER: We got to take a ride
back up to Paco'â€™s.

BYRNES: You'â€™re damn right
you do. And this time don'â€™t
come back without something.

Uptown at rush hour. Great.

Phew, I guess I
should'â€™ve been
a CPA.

Can you imagine,

her asking me to be
godfather to her baby?

Syke'â€™s Gallery.

Hi, Betty, it'â€™s Steve.
Is Teddy there?

Oh, hi, Steve.

Teddy'â€™s not here. She left 
early to get her hair done.

Alright, I'â€™ll try her at home.
Thank you.

Don'â€™t worry, I'll get you there
in time.

It'â€™s already six.

[DOOr, OPENS]

[DOOr, SHUTS]

Alright, thanks very much.

JACOBS: Ah, I was expecting
you two to turn up.

CARELLA: Believe me,
I had other plans.

JACOBS: Grabbing this one
away too? Be my guest.

JACOBS: We searched
the whole place yesterday.
There'â€™s nothing here.

CARELLA: Maybe you don'â€™t know
what to look for.

MEYER: Okay, you'â€™re going to
have to back up, please.

MEYER: Oh, man.

[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]


MEYER: You alright?

MEYER. Good, I got this.
I'â€™ll take it from here.

looking for?

FORENSIC ANALYST: I have to get
a shot of the blood splatter
on the wall.

[PHONE RINGING]

Hi, you'â€™ve reached Tim 
and Sally. At the tone, 
leave a message. Thanks.

CARELLA: Meyer, Meyer!MEYER: Yeah?

CARELLA: It finally fits.

Tim and Sally'â€™s number.
Where'â€™s that medical school
he attends?

MEYER: Ramsey University. It'â€™s
ten minutes from here.

CARELLA: I wouldn'â€™t want to
miss out on talking to Tim.
Everyone else is dead.

MEYER: Alright, the Loeb kid
said he was on the phone...

CARELLA: He could'â€™ve used
a pay phone.MEYER: Yeah.

There'â€™s probably one near
the theater. What about
the music?

Could'â€™ve been a cassette player.

Yeah, but didn'â€™t the Loeb kid
say they were back and forth
on the phone all night?

He lives ten minutes
from the theater.

He could'â€™ve gotten there,
killed her,

been back home in
forty five minutes, no sweat.

He leaves the phone
off the hook.

And our boy Tim calls up Loeb
and says he was talking to
somebody else.

Tim hasn'â€™t come
back to class.

When you two were
studying together on the phone,
did you ever call him?

LOEB: Yes. I told you.

Did you ever get a busy signal?

Uh, yeah.

Look, Detectives...

LOEB: You wouldn'â€™t be
asking me these questions
if you knew Tim. He'â€™s...

LOEB: He'â€™s a very unusual man.

You know, last year he was
in Miami, at the beach.

And this little Cuban kid
gets caught in a riptide.

LOEB: Tim goes in after him.

LOEB: Everyone else just
stands there, gawking.

LOEB: But, he took a chance,
and he saved little Nito'â€™s life.

I'â€™m sorry, who did you say?

Uh, the child, little
Nito Amanderas Junior.

LOEB: Tim keeps a snapshot
of him in his wallet.

CARELLA: Think about it?
Nito Amanderas, Cuban,
Miami beach.

The feds have been on his ass
for years.

Uncle Nito?

Why not? How many
Amanderas'â€™ are there?

Come on, come on, come on.

Where is it?

CARELLA: What do you
want to bet?

Sally wasn'â€™t buying from Paco.

She was supplying him with drugs
that Tim got sent from Miami.

Sure. How better to reward
a struggling medical student
that saved your kid'â€™s life?

Set him up in business.

So then "ice" had
nothing to do
with it?

Not bootleg ticket "ice" but
Edelman was a diamond merchant.

So Tim was turning "snow"
into "ice"?

Hey, Murchison, this is Carella.

Yeah?

I need you to do me a favor.
Send a car over to the
Elgin Theater.

Elgin Theater?

Yeah, that'â€™s right. Teddy's
waiting for me there and
I'â€™m not going to make it.

No problem.

I'â€™ve got the tickets, and she's
not going to be able to
get inside.

So if you could just apologize
for me

and put her in a cab home,
I'â€™d appreciate it.

CARELLA: She'â€™ll be waiting by
the box office.

[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]

BROTHER ANTHONY: Excuse me,
coming through. Enjoy the show.

EMMA: What took you so long?

I had to make them believe that
I was assisting in the funeral
preparations.

But, I got Sally'â€™s address.
And her boyfriend'â€™s name.

EMMA: I could'â€™ve got that,

from that Puerto Rican bitch
if I cut her some more.

EMMA: But, you rushed me.

Alright, I'â€™ll let
you waste the
Moore kid.

You can take all the time
you want to make him die.

What'â€™s the matter?

Let'â€™s go.

What?

You go on ahead.

Give me the address and I'â€™ll
meet you there.

I'â€™ve got some
unfinished business.

MAN: Hurry up honey.

WIFE: Wait, I'â€™m coming.

MAN: Take my hand, my hand.

WIFE: Oh, wait. The tickets.
MAN: I got them, I got them.

Talk to you later.

Why were you watching us?

What did you hear?

Where are you?

Where are you?

[LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY]

Why don'â€™t you scream?

EMMA: Let it all out.

Nobody can hear you.





[KNOCK AT DOOR]

BROTHER ANTHONY: Mr. Moore?

TIM: Yeah, what is it?

BROTHER ANTHONY: I'â€™m here about
the funeral arrangements
for Sally.

[DOOR OPENS]

Eritis sicut Deus.

I have no idea what you'â€™re
talking about.

The body hasn'â€™t even been
released by the police yet.

What the hell
do you want?

Seems like you'â€™ve been looking
for something here yourself.

TIM: Somebody broke in
and did this. I don'â€™t know
what they wanted.

The rest of her inventory,
that'â€™s what.

Was she hiding it
from you, Timothy?

Is that what got you
mad enough to
whack her?

I don'â€™t know
what you'â€™re talking about.

Sally and that
low life pimp.

Hmph, turns your stomach
just thinking of them together,
doesn'â€™t it?

BROTHER ANTHONY: Were they
planning to cut you out?

Stop! Alright, just stop.
You don'â€™t have to do that.

TIM: I don'â€™t give a damn about
the rest of the cocaine.

I wouldn'â€™t know where to sell it
anyway. I was just going to
flush it down the toilet.

BROTHER ANTHONY: Where is it?TIM: It'â€™s in the case by the TV.

Where'â€™s the key?

It'â€™s in my jacket, alright.

[GUN COCKING]

Aw, now you disappoint me.

A smarter man would'â€™ve
gotten rid of the gun.

I seem to keep needing it.

Who'â€™d you get your
information from?

Was it Edelman?

I hate to admit this.

I don'â€™t know
who Edelman is.

Doesn'â€™t that make me
feel foolish?

Who was it then?

It was Paco'â€™s whore.

We worked out the rest
ourselves.

Whose we?

Well, you don'â€™t think
I'â€™m here alone, do you?


MEYER: Police!

MEYER: Don'â€™t move!
Hands on your head!
Hands on your head!

Looks like this guy finally
found God. What'â€™s that?
A .38?

TIM: You know this guy?MEYER: He'â€™s clean.

CARELLA: You don'â€™t?

TIM: No, he broke in and trashed
the place looking for something.

MEYER: Guy messed up
your furniture, so you shot him?

TIM: He said he was going to
kill me like he killed Sally,

and some Spanish guy
I don'â€™t know.

He sure did a lot of talking.

TIM: I knew I was going to die
so I fought back, alright.

CARELLA: You shot this guy with
his own gun?

You expect us to believe that?

Arthur, we got a homicide...

TIM: Look, I just freaked out,
alright. If you guys had gotten
here sooner...

What are you guys doing here
anyway? You following this guy?

We'â€™re here to inquire about your
dear friend from Miami.
Uncle Nito.

TIM: You mean Mr. Amanderas?

CARELLA: Any idea what he does
for a living?

I met him for a minute.

His son was drowning and I
saved his life.

You lying...

TIM: You want to stop
this guy?

I can'â€™t. He's bigger than me.

It was your gun. You used it
on Sally, on Paco, on...

TIM: I don'â€™t know those names.
I don'â€™t know what you're
talking about.

I want a lawyer.

CARELLA: I bet you don'â€™t even
have to look up the number.

You shouldn'â€™t have put
your hands on me,
Detective Carella.

Because you'â€™re now in more
trouble than I am.

MEYER: You have the right to
remain silent. Anything you say
can and will be used against you

in a court of law.
You have the right to talk to
a lawyer.

TIM: Oh, Detectives.

You will apologize to me
before all this is over.

BROWN: Hey, guys.

I got a present for you.

I did a whole inventory

and there'â€™s better than
fifty carats of diamonds
unaccounted for.

That'â€™s worth
$500,000 wholesale.

Edelman, was laundering money
for somebody.

Drug money for diamonds.

CARELLA: That'â€™s the connection
we needed.BROWN: Aha!

MEYER: I'â€™m going to go
check on Tim'â€™s paperwork.CARELLA: Good work.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened? What happened?

Fat woman?

A razor?

I know the woman you mean.

Fat Emma Forbes.

What else did they say?

CARELLA: Yes, we found
the girl.

She was killed with a razor.

Baby, thank God.
You'â€™ve could've
been killed too.


[EXCLAIMING IN HORROR]

You'â€™re supposed to be
under the bridge.

I don'â€™t like having you too far
out of sight.

Your backup last night,
I hear they tanked.

Thank you but I'â€™m not freezing
my butt off all night

to have anyone
blow this for me.

Some coffee,
you want a slug?

Yeah, I'â€™ll take a little.

It'â€™s Amaretto Mocha.
Ground it myself.

EILEEN: Mmm.

Can I ask you a question?

Why does Parker go
out of his way to
needle Kling?

Yeah, those two guys have
something in common.

Both caught their wives
screwing around
with some other guy.

Is that what happened?

Caught her in bed with this
uh... this famous photographer.

The kind of guy
with only one name.

It was in all supermarket rags.
You didn'â€™t see it?

There'â€™s this uh...

this great big picture of the
top model and this little
picture of Kling.


Eh, what the hell?

Most of us don'â€™t get
our pictures in the paper,
until we get shot.

HAWES: Want to toss it in?

Been back and forth about
nine times now.

No, I'â€™m going to give it
another half hour.

Don'â€™t dog my tracks.

CARELLA: Try not to worry
about it.

We'â€™ll have her in custody soon.

I know you won'â€™t worry.

You sure you alright?

Okay.

This officer will make sure
you get home okay.

Are you sure you'â€™re alright?

Yeah?

Okay.

Bye.

I love you too.

Hawes?

EILEEN: Hawes, you with me?

Yeah, yeah. I got you.

Yeah, we'â€™re calling it a night.

Burke, what'â€™s that?

Go! Go! Go!

EILEEN: [GROANS]


Back off!

EILEEN: Hands clasped behind
the back of your neck.

Please don'â€™t hurt me.

Please don'â€™t tell anyone.

BOY: I didn'â€™t mean any of this.
Please don'â€™t tell my parents.

They'â€™ll kill me. I... [CRIES]

I never meant for this
to happen.

BOY: Don'â€™t tell anyone.

It'â€™s not my fault...
I didn'â€™t mean it.


Please, I'â€™m begging you.
Don'â€™t tell anyone.

Please! I'â€™m sorry.

COP: You have the right
to remain silent. Anything you
say can and will be used

against you in a court of law.

BOY: Please, don'â€™t hurt me.

You okay?

Uh, he'â€™s just a kid.

Yeah.

Kid with an ice pick.

You having a hell of a week.

It'â€™s a good thing
you thought of it.

Second piece I mean.

Lieutenant, I thought
you went home.

BYRNES: I'â€™m back.

You'â€™re acquainted with Mr. Gore

who'â€™s here on behalf of
Timothy Moore.

CARELLA: Looks like Uncle Nito
is still looking after his boy.

GORE: Detective, if you'â€™re
referring to Mr. Nito Amanderas
of Miami

I shall like to point out to you
that gentleman has never been
convicted of a crime.

Not even a misdemeanor.

I'â€™ll be taking this case on
pro bono.

CARELLA: Congratulations.
You'â€™re client already killed
four people.

GORE: I see. Is that why you
found it necessary to physically
assault my client

at the time of his arrest.

BYRNES: Don'â€™t say a word.
A complaint'â€™s been filed.
We'â€™ll look into it.

I would like my client released
as soon as possible

so he'â€™s not subjected to
any further police intimidation.

CARELLA: Not a chance.

BYRNES: It seems we have
some major, problems,

withholding Mr. Moore.

The Lieutenant has been
kind enough to show me
a statement made

by a Miss Teddy Franklin,

taken down by yourself.

GORE: It concerns a conversation
that she witnessed between this
deceased Brother Anthony person

and a woman identified as
Miss Emma Forbes.

Clearly seems to indicate that
they mutually participated
in the murder of a

prostitute named
Judite Quadrano.

Why would they kill one victim
with a razor, and the other
three with a .38?

Well, since Brother Anthony
is dead, we really can'â€™t answer
that, now can we?

But, perhaps if you found this
Emma person, she could
help you out.

There are two separate killers
involved here!

BYRNES: Carella.

GORE: That is your theory.

Of course you realize that
your girlfriend will be
testifying on our behalf.

Unless you plan to get her
to change her story.

Oh, you'â€™re unbelievable man.

GORE: I believe that you had
sufficient time to check
Mr. Moore'â€™s premises for any

illegal substances.

Have you found any?

No.

I believe that you have received
a phone call from Assistant
District Attorney D'â€™Angelo.

He made himself
perfectly clear.

We'â€™ll release Mr. Moore,

but I want him kept
readily available.

We'â€™re not finished
with him yet.

Poor, D'â€™Angelo.

I hated to wake him but
you can'â€™t have an innocent man
sitting in jail suffering abuse.


CARELLA: Can'â€™t we hold him
until morning?BYRNES: No, we can'â€™t.

Look, if that $500,000
in Edelman'â€™s safe came
from Timothy Moore,

then he got diamonds
in exchange for drug money.

So let'â€™s locate the
damn diamonds and make
our lives easier.

CARELLA: Yes.


GORE: The police have finished
with your apartment, so you can
go home now.

TIM: They haven'â€™t
got anything
on me.

Not unless they can
trace that gun back to you.

[DOOR, OPENS]

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

KLING: Yeah?EILEEN: Police Officer.

Oh, can I come in?

I need to talk.

I wanted to thank you,
for saving my life.

You'â€™re little suggestion
paid off.

You nailed him, didn'â€™t you?

EILEEN: He was... [CRIES]

...just a little boy.
Maybe 16.

But, he killed those women.

I know.

About yesterday,

I didn'â€™t know.

I'â€™m the one
who should apologize.

Come on guys!

Let'â€™s nail this down
before this son of a bitch
makes a run for it.

BYRNES: Easy gentlemen.

Focus.

Follow the money trail.

Alright, if I had all this cash

and I converted it to diamonds,

I'â€™d want to keep it close by
so I can grab it if I had to
take off.

First thing in the morning, I'â€™ll
check to see if he'â€™s got a
safe deposit box anywhere.

MEYER: No, that'â€™s a dead end.

Banks are closed Sundays,
holidays. He'â€™d want to
keep them close by.

BROWN: Well maybe he gave it to
a friend to look after for him.

CARELLA: Wait a minute.

Let'â€™s suppose Sally got a yen
for Paco.

They double crossed our boy.

They picked up the diamonds.

MEYER: That explains why the
apartment was trashed.

Timmy is looking for diamonds.

BYRNES: That'â€™s what this is
all about.

He'â€™s trying to
get his goods back.

MEYER: So he'â€™s there
right now,

same as us, trying to figure out
where she put the diamonds.

CARELLA: They weren'â€™t at
Paco'â€™s place.

BROWN: Well, was the girl'â€™s
dressing room searched?

Yeah, I searched it the night
of the killing. Nothing.

BYRNES: But, you weren'â€™t
looking for diamonds.

Where would anybody
hide diamonds
in a backstage dressing room?

Yeah, well, that'â€™s the 64
dollar question isn'â€™t it?

MEYER: Well, she shared
her dressing room
with a lot of people.

People who come and go
all the time.

BYRNES: Yeah, and the theater is
a big place.

You got drawers, you got
closets, you got cubbyholes...

There'â€™s got to be some place
we haven'â€™t searched.

How about
the safest place of all?

Right upfront, where everybody
can see them.

I don'â€™t know.

[PHONE RINGING]

Yeah?

Hi, it'â€™s uh... the stage 
doorman from the theater.

Look, we need to clear out
Miss Anderson'â€™s locker.

Do you mind coming by
in the morning and
picking up her things?

Fuck.

TIM: Yes I'â€™d

almost forgotten. Thanks.

[PHONE RINGING]

Kling.

Bert, we just played a hunch.

And if we'â€™re right,
our boy will bolt.

Got him.

Outstanding. Keep on him.

He'â€™s headed for the
Elgin Theater, and
so are we.

Young doctor'â€™s making a
house call boys.

I'â€™ll send backup to the theater.

DRIVER: Where to?TIM: The Elgin Theater.

Can you step on it, pal?

[PHONE RINGING]

Yeah?

Bert, it'â€™s Steve.
Where are you, buddy?

9th and 22nd. Headed uptown.

CARELLA: You till on him?KLING: Oh, yeah.

Alright, we got you.

You stay on him okay.

Don'â€™t get too close.

[PHONE RINGING]

Yeah?

CARELLA: Give him a little room.
You don'â€™t want to nail him until
he has the merchandise.

KLING: I'â€™m laying back.

TIM: Here you go.DRIVER: Thanks pal.

CARELLA: I'â€™m going to
follow our boy. Meyer?

MEYER: We'â€™re going in.
We'â€™re going in.

MEYER: John, cover this door.

MEYER: Go.

I got the back.Go, go. go.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

You work too hard
for your money, Tim.

Detective Carella.

Even Uncle Nito'â€™s not going to
be able to get you out of
this one, boy.

CARELLA: Tim!

[GUN COCKING]

MEYER: Hands up!


CARELLA: Meyer!

CARELLA: Do me a favor.

Don'â€™t drop that razor.

Come here.


CARELLA: Drop it! Drop it!

Right here! Right here!

CARELLA: You tried to use that
razor, on my girl,
earlier tonight, didn'â€™t you?

Huh? And you enjoyed it.

Well this is how I
get my kicks.

Come here!

CARELLA: Let'â€™s go.

Eritis sicut Deus, 
scientes bonum et malum.

COP: Excuse us please.
Coming through.

You really know what that means?

You shall be like God.

And know good from evil.

MEYER: I like it.CARELLA: Yeah.

Hey, Steve.

What would you say
if I told you,

I'â€™m going to be godfather
to Angie'â€™s kid?

That wouldn'â€™t surprise me
at all.

CARELLA: Godfather Meyer,
I like it.

MEYER: Yeah.
