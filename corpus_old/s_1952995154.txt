[drums beating]

[sleigh bells jingling]

[clock chiming]

<i>(man) Hey, there, Charlie.</i>

Let's move it.

Parade's about to start.

[bell jangling]


Oyez!

Oyez-ay!

Welcome to the Santa Claus parade!

[crowd cheering]

<i>[man over loudspeaker]</i>
<i>Here we go, folks.</i>

<i>Let's give a hand to the three</i>
<i>oaks high school marching band.</i>

[marching band playing slightly off-key]

<i>They're county champions</i>
<i>three years in a row.</i>

<i>(Klock) Get up there</i>
<i>and get into line.</i>

<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

Four across right here.

Stay right there.

All right, now, four across.

Troy, over there.

Four across, four across.

This is a parade.

We're marching this way.

<i>(man) Fire engine.</i>

[siren wails]

<i>Looks great.</i>

[horse snorts]

<i>The Saddle Claus.</i>

<i>Give him a hand, folks.</i>

[marching band playing jingle bells]</i>

<i>And here's the Gilldercroft</i>
<i>furniture float.</i>

<i>They do such a beautiful job.</i>

<i>Let's show them</i>
<i>how we appreciate</i>

<i>Their hard work and support.</i>

<i>Here comes the mayor.</i>

<i>Hi, mayor-y.</i>


<i>(man) And here they are,</i>

<i>the children of the three oaks</i>
<i>elementary school.</i>


I was just looking.

There's a reindeer missing up there.

<i>(Jamie) You don't know</i>
<i>about Prancer?</i>


Yeah, it's a big local legend.


What kind of legend?

Listen, shy boy speaks.

I like you better when you're quiet.

about Prancer?

Go ask that guy over there.

<i>He knows all about</i>
<i>the missing reindeer.</i>

<i>(man) Give a big hand.</i>

<i>Here comes our bagpipe band.</i>

[playing bagpipes]

Oof!
Excuse me.

Jim.

Denise.
Hi.

I was wondering when
I was going to run into you.

Oh, I bet you're looking
for that cute kid of yours.

Yeah.

We should have coffee.

Um, I'd like that.

<i>I'll call you.</i>

Charlie!

Mama's boy.

Charlie, where's your brother?

Saw him earlier.

Should be with the big kids.

He isn't.

You look great.

<i>(man) I want to see all of you</i>
<i>right back here on main street.</i>

<i>Christmas Eve for the annual</i>
<i>Prancer ceremony.</i>

<i>(man) What are you</i>
<i>doing here, kid?</i>

<i>(Charlie)</i>
<i>Well, somebody told me</i>

You know why this reindeer isn't
up there with the rest of them.

Well, the town hires me

to put the decorations up
every Christmas.

Guess that makes me
the local expert.

So you think you could
tell me about it?

Sure.

But if I tell you the Prancer
story, that makes you

the local expert from now on deal?

I like stories.

Okay, good.

Well, I guess it was
about ten years ago.

This little girl about your size

found this wounded deer
on the outside of town.

She thought it was
one of Santa's.

Here, hold this, will you?

Why'd she think that?

I don't know.

Uh, maybe because

her and her family were
going through a tough time,

and she probably figured
if the deer was Santa's,

it could help her out.

Anyway,

she gets this deer healthy,

takes it out to antler Ridge
on Christmas Eve.

Then guess what happens.

Santa comes along,
deer takes off.

Wshwwew.

Flies up and joins him.

That really happened?

That's the word.

So every Christmas since then,

when I put Santa and his
reindeer across main street,

Prancer's missing.

Then on Christmas Eve,
we have a big ceremony

where Prancerâ€™s reunited
with the team.

That's cool.

Oh, maybe you think so.

See, it just makes
more work for me,

'cause I put all the deer up,

then they gotta put this one up
on Christmas Eve,

and it's a mess.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

I'm Tom, by the way.

I'm Charlie Holton.

Charlie Holton,

nice to meet you.

Don't forget,

you're the local expert
from now on, anybody asks.

I gotta get going.
Maybe I'll see you around.

It's a small town.

Ever since we've moved here,

you've been in and out of trouble.

Now, why did you skip out
on the parade today?


Mom!

small-town Christmas parade.

That's just another thing I hate

About this stupid town.

I want to back to Chicago.

I want to go live with dad.


You said I could go back
for Christmas.

Well, I don't know anymore.

No, not after
this stupid stunt of yours.

I don't think so.

You can't stop me, mom.

I'm going.


[door slams]

Kind of quiet, huh?

Well, until Ryan learns to behave,

he's going to have to eat
his dinner in his bedroom.

I think he likes it there.


I need a hug.

Oh.

I'm doing the best
that I can here, kiddo.

Charlie,

I know how hard it is
when a parent leaves.

I've been there.

But if you ever need
to talk about it,

I'm here for you.

You know that, right?

Are you really going home
for Christmas?

I'm going for longer than that.

I wish you wouldn't.

So come with me.

I wish it was like before.

Don't you?

Everybody was happy.

Dream on, bro.


I hope you don't go.

[kids yelling outside]

[kids yelling]

Dear Lord,

I pray for a good Christmas
for me and my family

and for everyone else
who's having a bad time.

Amen.

[melancholy music]

â™ª    â™ª

[whistle blows]

â™ª have a Holly, jolly Christmas. â™ª

â™ª it's the best time of the year. â™ª

â™ª I don't know if there'll be snow, â™ª

â™ª but have a cup of cheer. â™ª

â™ª have a Holly, jolly Christmas, â™ª

â™ª and when you walk down the street, â™ª

â™ª say hello to friends you know â™ª

â™ª and everyone you meet. â™ª

â™ª oh-ho, the mistletoe â™ª

â™ª hung where you can see. â™ª

Hey, there.

Hi.

Look, we're sorry about yesterday.

You are?

Yeah.

And to make it up to you,

we'd like you
to play a game with us.

See Jamie over there?

<i>Well,</i>

The object of this game

is to be the first
to hit her with a snowball.

Don't worry.

Girls like to be hit by snowballs.

Yeah.

It means you like them.

You like Jamie, don't you?

She's okay.

We'll even let you go first.

So what you do,

get the snowball.

And nail her right
in the back of the head.

â™ª oh, by golly, have a Holly, jolly â™ª

Whoa!

Let's go.

Whoa.

He's in trouble.

He's dead.

[military March played on snare drums]

â™ª    â™ª

[both snickering]

Charlie.

I know you're a nice kid.

Maybe just a little absentminded.

Throwing snowballs

when I'm sure you know that's
strictly against the rules?

You force me to do something,

But it's for your own good.

I'm giving you detention.

[kids gasping] Oh!


While you're there,

I suggest you spend
some time thinking about how

you might better follow those rules.

Yes, sir.

Thank you.

You may go inside now.

But recess isn't.

Oh, it's over for you.

[kids muttering]

Whap!

<i>[Carol of the bells playing drearily]</i>

â™ª    â™ª

[creaky groaning sound]

[crow cawing]

[trees creaking]

[loud, mysterious gurgling sound]

[Charlie panting]

[gurgling noise]

[suspenseful music]

[trees creaking]

[spooky gurgling]

[panting and wheezing]

[gurgly neighing]




Prancer?


I gotta get help.

You stay here.

I'll be right back.


Whoa!

[mooing fiercely]


Can't you read?

This is private property.

Huh?

Ryan!

Mom!

Ryan!

Mom!

[reindeer lows]

What are you doing here?

Come on, let's go to my house.



What is it?


You want to wear that?

That's it, boy.

Now listen to me.

I'm going to find my brother.

You have to stay here.

So make yourself at home,

but don't mess up the place, okay?


I need your help.

What are you doing?

Get off of me.

I'll explain on the way.

You have to come.

Where?
What's wrong with you?

The woods.

What can we do for him?

Nothing.

This deer's dead, Charlie.

No, he can't be.

<i>Look, this kind of stuff happens.</i>

Animals get old, and they die.

But not

this isn't Prancer.

<i>It's just some deer.</i>

Don't get all worked up.

Come on, bro.

Let's go home.

It's cold out here.

Nothing we can do.

[wind whistling]

[dramatic music]

Ryan!

Did you see that?

<i>(Ryan) Charlie,</i>

<i>Let's go.</i>

Hey, there, little guy.


[door opens]

Uh,

That's my brother.

I don't think he should know
about you.

He wouldn't understand.

I have to figure out what to do.

Everything happened so fast.

Hmm.

First things first.

What do I call you?

Prancer.

After your father.

It's a perfect name.


You'll be my secret, Prancer,

my secret friend.

[knocking at door]


<i>(Denise) Charlie?</i>

Stay still.

<i>(Denise) Charlie?</i>

Um, I got a call from the vice
principal at work today.

You want to tell me
what happened?

Uh, just playing with my friends.

Sorry, mom.
It won't happen again.

[Prancer grumbles]

Um...

[fakes yawn]

I'm tired.

I think I'll go to bed early tonight.

Uh-huh.

You mind, mom?

A little privacy?


That was close.

We'll have to be careful, Prancer.


I don't think my mom
would let you stay here.

Thump!  Thump!

That's right.

That's your dad.

Probably miss him already,

<i>Don't you?</i>


I know how hard it is
when a parent leaves, Prancer.

<i>But I'm here for you.</i>

I am.

And I'm going to get you
back where you belong

Somehow.

[hooves clomping]

Hey, Prancer, stop it.


What's the matter?


You must be hungry.

Coast is clear, Prancer.

Kitchen is open for business.


What's the matter with you, Prancer?

This is some of the best food
in the world.

I could live on this stuff.

I don't know about you,

But I'm having breakfast.

[sloppy slurping noises]

Prancer!

Slurrp!

Milk.

Of course.

Little reindeer like milk.

Hi, there.

I don't know if you remember me.

Hopefully, your owner doesn't.

(old man Richards)
What are you doing here?

Whoa.

I just
you sellin' magazines?

No, I'm.

Are you selling Christmas candy?
I don't want any.

I'm not.

Wait a second.

I know you.

That was a mistake.

I was in a hurry.

This is private property.

I know, but

I want you to hit the road, Junior.

Come on.

I just want some milk.

Milk?

<i>Yes, sir.</i>

I need a lot of it.

I'm willing to work for it.

What makes you think
I have a lot of milk?

You have a cow, don't you?

Yeah, but she hasn't
given milk in years.

Why not?

Because she's too old.

Well, can I try?


Yeah.

Yeah, you can try.

Have fun, son.

Charlie!

What'd you do with all the milk?


What the?


<i>I know we got off</i>
<i>to a bad start yesterday.</i>

<i>But you have to</i>
<i>help me out here.</i>

I have Prancerâ€™s kid at home.

You know, Prancer?

One of Santa's reindeer?


I'm serious about this.

The little guy drinks a ton of milk.

If you can just give me some,
it'd be great.


Oh.

Come on.

What do you say?

Give it up for Santa.


Ah, give up?

No, sir.

I need another bucket.

[milk squirting]

<i>(old man Richards) How...</i>

How did you?

I just gave her a pep talk.

Pep talk?

Yes, sir.

Told her that I needed it for Santa.

What are you talking about?

Don't you put milk out for Santa?

Not anymore.

Something wrong?

<i>I don't recognize you.</i>

I know most people in town,

but you, I

I don't recognize.

I just moved here.

My mom and dad got a divorce
a few years ago.

Hasn't been going all that well.

My mom's worried about me,

because I don't have any friends.

She and my brother fight
all the time.

You ever fight with your kids?

What?

Fight with your kids.
Ever do that?

Sure.

Sometimes.

Why don't you ever

put milk out for Santa anymore?

Well, I don't have to.

All my kids are grown up
and gone away.

Ever go to that thing they have
on Christmas Eve?

Uh, do you always talk like this?

Like what?

Well, you bounce around
from one thing to the next.

I can't keep up with you.

What thing on Christmas Eve?

Downtown.

Someone puts Prancer on
the display over main street.

All those crowds, jolly people.

No, thank you.

And make sure you bring that
back when you're done.

[cow moos]

What do you want?

Hey.
Hey, there.

Charlie, right?

<i>(Charlie)</i>
<i>Guess you're wondering why I</i>
<i>have a ten-gallon pail of milk.</i>

I figured you'd tell me
if you wanted me to know.

Tom, you think Santa's
reindeer live forever?

Never really thought about it.

They've been around forever, right?

Far as I know.

And their names never change?

Right.

What if they don't live forever?

And they have babies,
and they grow up

To take their parent's place?

<i>Think that's possible?</i>

You seem to have given this

much more thought than I have,
Charlie,

so if you think it's possible,

I think it's possible.

Oh
oh, no, it's my mom.

Um, that's your pail of milk

If she asks.

Looking for something?

What'd you do with him?

Put him in the basement.

Where'd you get that thing?

You have to help me out.

Mom's home.

So?

She might like him.

You know, he's kind of cute,

in an ugly sort of way.

She won't even let us have a dog.

Tom Sullivan.

Yeah?

Denise Randolph.


Hi, mom.

What are you doing home?


Wait a minute.

How do you two know each other?

We...yeah, we met at the parade
the other day.

Oh, mom, you need help
with the groceries?

Um...

Uh, I'll be right back.

You know my mom?

Well, yeah, her

Your uncle, her brother
and I were best friends

In high school.

Help me get the milk
down to our basement.

Sure.

Wait a second.

Hey, Charlie, Charlie.

What's going on here?

Huh?

I'd like to keep this
my secret for now.

Okay, just be careful.

If I were you, I wouldn't
keep anything in the house

If your mom
doesn't know about it.


I'll take it from here.

You go talk to my mom.

Charlie?

Hey.

I can't believe it.

What are you doing back here

in the old house?

I thought you were gone for good.

Well, so did I.

Oh, but you know, things happen.

Well, how have you been, Tom?

Uh, can't complain.

How's Marian?

Good.

I don't know, I

I haven't talked to her
in a while.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry to hear that.

Well, like you said, things happen.

The blue bomb.

Yeah.

Dad left it to me.

Man, your brother and I
tooled around in that thing.

I know it's old and all, Denise,

but it sounds terrible.

Oh, I know.

I've been meaning to take it in,

But time and money
I'm a little short on both.

I could take a look at it
for you sometime.

What did you do,
become a mechanic?

No, no, no.

I'm a, uh...

I'm like a handyman now.

Do this and that.

That's why I'm
in the neighborhood.

I'm fixing the fence over there.

And I better get back to it.

So it was it was great seeing you.

Well, I'm glad you caught me
in front of the house,

Otherwise I don't think
you would have recognized me.

Well?

Well, it's okay.

I mean, I was
a lot younger back then.

Life's tamed me a bit.

No, you look really good.

Thank you.

I'll see you around?

Yeah.

I can't believe that Tom
was uncle Gary's best friend.

Yeah, and he used to hang out
here all the time.

[Prancer groaning]

Listen, guys,

Um, I'm going to go out for a bit

After dinner

For a cup of coffee
with an old friend.


Oh, good.

I mean,

<i>Have fun.</i>

Be as late as you want.

Well, I thought it would be
kind of nice

If the two of you could
do something together tonight.

[clears throat]

I think was mom's trying to say
is that,

Because I'm leaving
for Chicago tomorrow,

<i>It'd be cool if we hung out.</i>

Um, I didn't want to tell you.

I thought you might get upset

Because I'm getting out
of the last day of school.

I don't care about that.

It's just going to be
a different kind of Christmas.

[doorbell rings]

Hi, Jim.

Good evening, Denise.

<i>(Denise) Come on in.</i>

Charlie, you know Jim.

That's Mr. Klock to you, young man.

Well, I rented a couple of videos,

and there's some popcorn
in the cupboard.

Bye, Ryan.

See you later, Charlie.

I hope not.

Who is this guy?

The Darth Vader
of elementary school.

You know you can't
keep him here.

Thought you said
mom might like him.

I was kidding.

He's not going to be here for long.

I'll have him back with Santa
before you know it.

And how do you plan
on doing that?

I haven't thought about it.

Well, maybe you should.

But in the meantime,

You gotta find
another place for him.

Isn't he the greatest thing
you've ever seen?

Yeah.

He looks like he could be
on that cable show,

Freaks of nature.


You didn't hear that.

Ryan,

Thanks for helping out today.

That was a cool thing to do.

See, he's not so bad after all.



What about me?

Well, you've come back
to three oaks.

Is that part of a master plan?

Oh.

No, I came back after dad died

In hopes to get the house
together and sell it.

But it's been a bit of a struggle

Making ends meet in Chicago

Ever since Matt and I divorced.

So I thought, "heck,

"here's a home ready to move into,

with memories to boot."

Good ones, I hope.

Sure.

And some not-so-good ones,

but isn't that everybody's childhood?

If you're lucky,

The good memories
outweigh the bad.

And that's what I hope
for my boys,

that the good outweigh the bad.

I mean, they're the main reason
I came here.

I just want to make a real home
for them.


<i>You can find anything you want</i>
<i>on the net,</i>

including the north pole, I bet.

<i>All I have to do is find</i>
<i>Santa's website,</i>

<i>type in the letter,</i>

and tell him what's going on.

Simple.

â™ª ho-ho-ho! â™ª

Check it out.
What'd I tell you?

This is what you do.

You land on a roof.

Santa drops off the presents.

You take off
and go to the next house.

Isn't that neat?

I'm telling you;

you have a very exciting future
ahead of you.


some of my best were when
we were seeing each other.

I was really sorry to see you go.

You know that.

And I'm happy you're back.

[door opens]

Klock.

Tom.

And Denise.

Hi, Tom.

Old acquaintance?

Yeah, he was my older brother's
best friend.

Pretty crazy back then.


Don't get me wrong.

I like Tom,

but he's the kind of guy who
never really grew up.

You know the type?

Still acts like he's in high school.

Disappears for weeks at a time
to go fishing or hunting.

Drives a motorcycle.

So?

In the middle of winter?

You know, I hate to say it, Denise,

but Tom totally irresponsible.

So whatever happened between him
and Marian summers?

Oh, what do you think?

She got fed up with him.

Did they have any children?

No, no.

I don't think he wanted any.

I mean, there might have been
another reason for the breakup.

Anyway,

can't believe I ran into you
at the parade the other day.

I don't know.

Seems like fate.

I mean, here I am
at a point in my life

Where I'm getting ready
to settle down,

and you turn up suddenly.


"I live in Three Oaks, Michigan.

<i>"remember that place?</i>

"You'll never guess who I have
living in my house.

"Prancerâ€™s kid.

"We'll meet you at antler Ridge
on Christmas Eve,

"seven o'clock sharp!

"You know the drill...

Your friend, Charlie."




Listen, you little elf,

mom's at the door.

Sure you don't want to go down
to south bend?

It's tempting.

Be like old times.

Let's do it.

I have to get up early
in the morning.

Ryan's heading off to Chicago.

Okay, I won't press.

Rain check?

Sure.

Good night.

Good night.

Had a great time, cookie.

Remember?

Yeah, you know, I'd kind of
like to forget that nickname,

if you don't mind.

It was good seeing you, Jim,

nice catching up.

Hey, mom.

Charlie's asleep.

He is?

Uh, yeah, he was kind of beat.

I hope he's not coming down
with something.

Seemed fine to me.

Okay.

Good night.

Good night.

Don't play your music too loud.

Get that deer out of here.

Okay.



[Tchaikovskyâ€™s <i>dance of the</i>
<i>sugar plum fairy</i> plays]

â™ª    â™ª

[water trickling]

Oh, no.

Ryan?

Mom?


Whoa!

What are you doing in the bathtub?

[door slams]

It's mom.


Ryan?

Charlie?

Hi, mom.

What on earth are you doing up
so early?

Thought I'd take a bath.

That's very... <i>unusual</i> of you.


Christmas coming and all.

Too excited.

<i>Mo?</i>

You mind?

A little privacy.

Right.

Privacy.

Whew.

[cow mooing]

[footsteps clattering]


Hello, there, young man.

<i>Hey, already out of milk?</i>

<i>(Charlie) no, sir.</i>

<i>I need another favor.</i>

Oh, what is it this time?

Well, sure, I heard about it.

The little girl
was practically a neighbor.

Now it's happening all over again.

Yeah, looks like it, eh?

<i>Thanks for taking Prancer,</i>
<i>Mr. Richards.</i>

It was getting too dangerous
for him at my place.

Oh, well.

He's just another mouth to feed,

but don't worry.

I'll take care of him.

Sure you don't want to come?

I didn't think so.

I can do things with you.

[horn honking]

Look, I gotta run.

Be cool.

[sorrowful music]

â™ª    â™ª


Of course.

He said he wasn't.

Ryan's a little confused right now.

About what?

Well, maybe about
the same thing you are.

He's not sure
where his home is.

See, if we had lived in Chicago,
you would have two homes,

<i>one with me</i>
<i>and one with your dad</i>

and his new family.

But we moved here.

I know why we came here.

Dad doesn't want us around.

That is not true.

It just seemed like I was
getting in his way all the time.

Hey, look at me.

Your father leaving had nothing
to do with you, Charlie.

He loves you.

Come here.

I love you.

I love you too.

[Prancer bellowing]

[rooster crows]

Moo!

[bus horn honks]

[Prancer bellows]

[school bell ringing]

Oh, my gosh.

I got it.

[Tchaikovskyâ€™s <i>fairies</i> playing]

â™ª    â™ª

[Prancer bellows]

[school bell ringing]

Oh, my gosh.

What is that?

Whoa!

A reindeer!

A reindeer.

Wow!

Mr. Klock.

Emergency.

I am speaking to
the district superintendent.

Then perhaps you'd like to tell him

There's a reindeer roaming
the hallways with the children.


Step aside.

Out of the way.


All right,
back up, back up, back up.

Be sure to thank

Kris Kringle for your present.

There's a deer in the school.

What?

Somebody get security!

Prancer!


Let him go!

He won't hurt anyone.

Charlie, let go of me.

Stop it!

Crunch!



Get him in a classroom!

No!

<i>(Klock) You!</i>

In my office!

I'm trying to be really calm
right now.

But you know what
I'm actually doing?

I'm standing here,
and I'm asking myself,

if I were your father,

<i>what would I do</i>

in a situation like this?

<i>Clearly, some kind of</i>

significant punishment is in order.

What will you do with Prancer?

I've called animal control.

The deer is dangerous.

I expect that he will be put down.

You can't do that to him.

I can, and I expect they will.

You don't understand
how serious this is, do you?

Yes, I do.

Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that.

But you don't.

What's that supposed to mean?

It means I can't trust anyone
over nine.

And you're not my father.

<i>Charlie,</i>

Get back here.

You're in big trouble, little man.

[sprightly adventure music]

â™ª    â™ª

Click!


Hey.

You two seen Charlie Holton?


Denise.

I know how unpredictable
they can be.

A pet deer?

I mean, I can't believe it.

Where did he find it?

Where did he hide it?

Mr. Klock?

I'll be accompanying
the search party.

Excuse me.

Very good.

When you find that deer,

I want it put down.

You understand?

See, Denise.

Here's the sheriff.

Everything's under control.

My son's run off
with a dangerous deer.

How is that under control?

Did you say something
to him, Jim?

No.

I mean, I think I was
very understanding.

Excuse me.

Prancer.

We'll have to stay hidden
until Christmas Eve.

That's two whole days
and two nights.

I've never even camped out before.

First things first.

Shelter:

Gotta find some.

Wonder if that's the way
to antler Ridge.

Come on. Let's go.

Hey, slow down, will ya?

than your typical search.

The boy may not want
to be found.

We've got to get to him
before sundown.

After dark, he may not be able
to get home,

Even if he wants to.

Each group have a walkie-talkie?

Yeah, sir.

Why don't you head on home,
Denise?

I'll be in constant touch
with the search parties,

And I'll call you
the second I hear anything.

I'm going to go get
some warmer clothes.

I can't just stay at home

While my son is out
in the Forest somewhere.

We'll go the rest of the way
tomorrow.

This is a pretty good place
to stay for the night.


what we're going to do

For the next three to four hours.

Hey, I have an idea.

Why don't I tell you a story?

I bet you like stories.

A Christmas Carol.

There once was a Guy
named scrooge,

The meanest man around

Like Klock, that guy you bit.

Picture him.

Well, scrooge lives all alone
in a house that nobody enters,

And he's mean to everybody.

He gives no money to the poor.


To his family and scrooge

And says "God bless us, every one."

Isn't that a great story?

Of course, it's better told
around a nice, warm fireplace.


Hey, you're warm.

There, that's better.

[phone ringing]

Hello.

Denise, it's Jim.

<i>Listen, you probably</i>
<i>know this already,</i>

But all the parties have called
<i>off the search for the night.</i>

Uh, yeah, I know that, Jim.

Are you okay?

Maybe I should come over
and spend the night.

<i>(Denise) Uh, no.</i>

I'm, be fine.

I'm a little worried about you.

Well, you know,
I'm worried about Charlie,

But thank you for your concern,

And I'll call you if I need anything.

Bye.

[doorbell rings]

Tom, hi.

I'm sorry for bothering you.

No, no, no.

I just got home.

I was working all day.

I didn't know about Charlie
till I got your message.

Um...

<i>Tom, did you know about</i>

Charlie and his deer?

No.

I knew something was up,

But he said he wanted
to keep it a secret,

And I told him he shouldn't
have anything in the house

That you didn't know about.

I should have mentioned something.

I told Charlie
I'd keep his secret a secret,

And my word's good.

But kids don't always know
what's best for them.

Well, sometimes they do, Denise.

You just have to trust them.


I don't even know
if I can trust myself anymore.

<i>Sometimes I think</i>
<i>Ryan and Charlie</i>

Would be so much better
with their father.

Not that matt is the best dad
in the world,

But he's so practical.

I mean, he wouldn't let

<i>Any of this get by him.</i>

Well, you can't blame yourself
for Charlie running off.

<i>Why can't I?</i>

I mean, Ryan's taken off to Chicago.

Charlie... I don't even know
where Charlie is.

This isn't a home.

This is a place to run away from.

Oh, God.

Poor Charlie.

Okay, look,
Charlie's gonna be all right.

He's tougher than you think.

And you need to get

Some sleep,

And I'll come back
as soon as it's light,

And we'll go find him.

Have a little Faith, Denise.

We're gonna find him, okay?

Thanks, Tom.

â™ª if you believe deep in your heart, â™ª

â™ª then things that aren't possible â™ª

â™ª suddenly are. â™ª

? if you believe, â™ª

â™ª a wish on a star
might really come true, â™ª

â™ª and they do. â™ª

â™ª if you believe. â™ª

Dear God,
please let Charlie be okay,

because he's a really neat kid.

Amen.

â™ª even though it seems impossible, â™ª

â™ª on Christmas Eve night, â™ª

â™ª while children sleep,
Santa comes by, â™ª

â™ª delivering gifts only if
if you believe. â™ª

I'm sorry, boy.

I'm tired, that's all.

You know, I feel bad.

You know why?

Because I don't think

I can stay out here
for another two days.

I'll get frostbite

or starve.

You understand what I'm saying?

I can't take care of you anymore.


You have to fly away.

It's the only thing to do.

Head for the north pole.

It's time, Prancer,

Time for you
to take your father's place.

<i>Here's what you do.</i>

<i>You run as fast as you can,</i>

think positive thoughts,
flying kind of thoughts,

and you jump up,

and you should be able
to take off into the Sky.

Let's try one, okay?

That's it.

Faster, boy.

Remember, think flying thoughts.

On three, jump into the air.

You ready?

One, two,

three.

Oof!


No, Prancer,
you're supposed to take off.

Like an airplane.

Let's try it again.

Isn't this the way to antler Ridge?

Yeah, I told Charlie about
this Prancer legend we have.

Oh, yeah, I've actually
heard about the legend.

Do you think he's trying to
retrace the little girl's path?

Oh, it's a hunch.

That's it, boy.

This is the one.

You're going to do it this time.
No, don't stop.

<i>Follow me, Prancer.</i>

Ah!  Ah!



Hey, there, boy.

<i>You were trying to warn me,</i>
<i>weren't you?</i>


No, stay there. You hear me?

Prancer.

Stay there. You hear me?

<i>Prancer,</i>

Where are you going?


[bird squawking]

Charlie!

[crow cawing]

[trees creaking]

Charlie!

Charlie!

[Prancer grunting]


Let's go.

Charlie!

[dramatic music]

â™ª    â™ª


He'll come back.

I know he will.


Prancer.

Mom.

<i>Hi, Tom.</i>

[walkie-talkie beeping]

Sheriff, come in.

<i>[man over radio] Go ahead.</i>

It's Tom Sullivan.

We found him.

Hey, sweetheart.

Take care of Prancer.

<i>(Denise) Everything's going</i>
<i>to be okay, honey.</i>


Thank you.

What are you doing?

Taking this animal to the shelter.

You'll do no such thing.

Ma'am, when a wild animal
bites someone,

we're required to
take it into custody.

Why?

Well, we have to check to see
if the animal has any diseases.

Based upon that and other factors,

Possibly put the animal down.

You can't do that.

This animal helped save
my son's life.

Well, it's the law.


Do that.

I'm going to take you to Charlie,

and I'll go to the shelter

and make sure they don't
do anything rash, okay?

Come on.


There's nothing I can do about it.

Okay, who else can I talk to?

Who's the supervisor here?

Mr. Dexter,

But he's gone home
for the rest of the day.

He won't be back in
till tomorrow morning,

And as far as I know,

that's when the vet's
supposed to put the deer down.

Give me Dexter's phone number.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I can't give out information
of that nature.

All right, you have Dexter call me

Before anything's done
to that deer, okay?

Mom?

Hi, sweetheart.

How you feeling?

You slept all the way home
from the hospital.

Where's Prancer?

Don't worry about Prancer right now.

Doctor says you need to rest,

And fortunately for us,
it was just a sprain.

Where is he?

He's at the shelter.

The shelter?

<i>You let them take him</i>
<i>to a shelter?</i>

No, listen, sweetheart

<i>they're going to kill him.</i>

Klock will do it himself.

He hates Prancer.

Charlie.

Tom was just down at the shelter.

He said your deer is fine.

I tried to stop them, honey.

Believe me, I did.

How you doing, big boy?

Charlie, your mom did everything
she could to help Prancer.

I screwed up everything.

What do you mean?

I made a mess of everything.

I tried to help Prancer
but just made everything worse.

I was the last person
he should have come to.

Charlie, that deer is
the luckiest deer in the world.

Nobody could have taken care
of him like you did.

Let me ask you something.

You believe in your deer,
that he's Prancerâ€™s kid,

Right?

There you go.

See, when you believe in something,

It makes other people believe,
and when that happens,

Things have a way
of working out.

But Prancerâ€™s in jail.

I know,

but let me worry
about that for now.

You just
you get some rest.

You're gonna help me?

Charlie, I'm gonna do everything
I can to help you fix this.

I promise.

[dogs barking]

[dogs whining]


such a good idea.

Well, it could work.

I had to think of something.

I promised Charlie.

And your word is good?

Yes, it is.

There they are.

I'm scared.

Well, that's normal.

Everybody's afraid
to get in front of the camera.

It's the abnormal ones who like it.

So just keep saying
this is for Prancer, okay?

Okay.

Okay, he's ready.

[over TV] this is Charlotte Purcell
in three oaks, Michigan.

Ten years ago, a little girl
named Jessica Riggs

Found a wounded deer in the
woods not far from this town.

<i>She believed it was Prancer,</i>

<i>and her story has become</i>
<i>local legend ever since.</i>

Tonight the legend
has come alive once again.

Eight-year-old Charlie Holton

<i>was rescued after an intense</i>
<i>search in those same woods</i>

Outside three oaks.

He had gone missing
a day earlier,

But he wasn't alone.

Charlie was with a deer
he believes is Prancerâ€™s son.

<i>[Charlie over TV]</i>
<i>I found the deer in the woods</i>
<i>near my house</i>

<i>A couple of days ago.</i>

<i>He followed me to school,</i>

<i>And, well, he bit</i>
<i>my vice principal.</i>

He didn't mean to.

He was just protecting me.

What makes you think

This is the son of one
of Santa's reindeer, Charlie?

He has the same Mark on
his forehead that Prancer did.

He's just a little deer.

I don't want him hurt.


<i>Where Prancer is</i>
<i>being kept revealed</i>

The deer is due to be put down
tomorrow morning.

Charlie.

Hey.

They're gonna kill Prancer.

You heard her.

Charlie, nothing's happening
to that deer tonight; trust me.

<i>(Purcell) The offspring</i>
<i>of Prancer.</i>

<i>We'll be sure to keep you</i>
<i>up to date on this story</i>

<i>and Prancerâ€™s fate</i>
<i>in the coming days.</i>

This is Charlotte Purcell reporting.

Honey.


That was Mr. Dexter,
the supervisor at the shelter.

The mayor called him

And told him not to touch
that deer tomorrow morning.

There's going to be a big
meeting at the town hall

Tomorrow at 5:00.

They're going to discuss this thing.

You want up?

There you go.

I am so proud of you, sweetheart.


Hop on, I'll give you

a lift upstairs.

Hey.

Oof!

Oh!

What have you been eating?

I don't know.

Graham crackers.

Meatloaf.

Potatoes.

Quite a day, huh?

I was outside Charlie's room
this afternoon

when you were talking to him.

I saw him hug you.

Hmm.

And just right now,

when you took him
upstairs to bed...

I know it is such a simple thing,

but you have no idea
how good it is to see that.

Oh, hey, he's a great kid.

And you got a lot to do with that.


Thanks.

You know, Tom,
for never wanting to have kids,

you have quite
an easy way with them.

Who told you
I didn't want to have kids?

Marian was the one who wanted
to hold off having a family.

Wanted to see the world first
and, uh...

I don't know.

I don't think she thought
I would be a good father.

I'm kind of unpredictable at times.

Like a big kid.

Maybe that's why I get along
with them so well.

It's a shame
we were such a mismatch.

I mean, I would have loved

To have a big ol' house
full of kids,

You know?

But you meet someone,

And you think you're
the love of their life.

You find out you're not.

I know the feeling.

Hey.

Take my truck home tonight.

No, no.

Yeah, go on.

I don't want you driving your bike

At night.

Come on.

Okay.

Good night.

Good night.

Looks like you're safe for now,
Prancer.

I know, I know.

Trust me.

I said I'd get you back to
antler Ridge by 7:00 tomorrow.

I will, one way or another.

last night:

Prancer's practically
the town mascot.


We have to be very careful
how we handle this.

The eyes of the world are on us.



[doorbell rings]

Sorry I'm late.

<i>I had to stop to get help.</i>

<i>It's okay.</i>

They said they wanted to come.

They said they'd behave.

<i>(boy) We saw you on TV</i>
<i>last night.</i>

We want to learn more about this
deer of yours.

It's a long story.

We like stories.

[inspiring marching music]


All right, all right.

Just sit down, please.


I'd like to address the room.

[crowd groans and grumbles]

<i>(man #1)</i>
<i>Show up on time, then.</i>

(man #2)
Take off that sling, you faker!

All right, first of all, first of all,

I want to remind everybody
about the buck

That came into town
a few years back.

It terrorized a lot of people,

Rammed some cars
with its antlers.


Now, that animal was put down.

<i>Everybody remembers</i>
<i>the wolf a few years ago.</i>

A lot of people's pets disappeared.

That animal was put down as well.

I took six stitches in this arm.

This is not a docile deer
we're talking about.

This is not Santa's little helper.

[crowd groaning]

<i>But I want to be clear.</i>

I want to be clear about something.

I'm glad that I'm the one
that took the six stitches

and not one of my kids.


<i>So whatever you decide</i>
<i>to do, mayor,</i>

<i>and I can only suggest</i>
<i>what you do,</i>

<i>I think it would be</i>

a mistake to let that animal go.

Just the thought of it
coming back into town

and doing this
to one of my kids

is not worth the risk.

I, for one, don't want that
on my conscience.

[crowd murmuring]

Yes, well,

<i>In order for us all</i>
<i>to enjoy the Prancer ceremony</i>

<i>without any further</i>
<i>controversy,</i>

we will put off any
final decision about the deer

until after the holidays.

Yeah!


This meeting is adjourned.

Thanks for coming,

Mr. Richards.

Oh, least I could do afterâ€¦

after letting your deer get away.

This might be dangerous.

Hope you don't get in trouble.

<i>I'm 80 years old.</i>

How much trouble can I get into?


Looks like we're all here.

Let's get to it.

[door beeping]

[sobbing desperately]


she lost her cat.

Oh.

I'm sorry to hear that,
but we're not officially open.

I'm just here to guard the deer.

[cries harder]

Uh...

No cats came in today.

Could we just take a look?

I mean, it'll only take a minute.

Okay.

Just make it fast.

Thank you so much, sir.

<i>Thanks.</i>

[dogs barking]

Great work, guys.

You should have seen Jamie.

She was great.

We're in.

Phase two.

Uh, you were supposed to have
Prancer here, right?

What'd I just tell you?

Somebody took the deer.

What?

What's that?


Oh, place is closed, on the double.

[Tchaikovskyâ€™s <i>fairies</i> playing]

[tires squealing]

Charlie.


Charlie?

Could he be sleeping?

â™ª    â™ª

<i>(man) Oh, this is not good.</i>

[horn blaring]

Oh, these guys better not
get me fired.

Is there a problem?

Well, what do you think?

Of course there's a problem.

Coming, Mr. Richards?

The ceremony's about to start.

Ah, we'll make it.

Now.

Well, we could use your help,
Sonny.

Come on. Let's go.

W--yeah, okay.

[Prancer gurgling]

Good to see you too, boy.

I missed you.

We're going to find the key
and get you out of this jail.

Time to go see Santa.

Got 'em!


Yes.

Okay, let's go.


<i>(Klock) Yes, sheriff.</i>

I'm looking at them
even as we speak.

I will.

Thank you.

I'll see you shortly.

<i>I must tell you, Charlie,</i>

<i>this is a lot</i>

More serious
than throwing a snowball.

[dog barks echoing]

[giggles quietly]

What's so funny?

I don't know.

All of a sudden,

I just feel like everything's
going to be okay.

[dogs barking]


Whoa, whoa!

Whoa, okay, okay.

Okay, okay, get down.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

<i>(Ryan)</i>
<i>so much for the Darth Vader</i>
<i>of elementary school, huh?</i>

[Klock groaning]

Ryan!

Hey.

What are you doing here?

Well, you weren't at home.

I just had a hunch
where I might find you.


Why are you back so soon?

You were on the national news, bro.

I had to come back
and see what was going on.

Besides, I missed you.

This is real sweet and all,

But shouldn't we be going?


not by a long shot!


Only half an hour till 7:00, Charlie.

We won't make it.


Hi, mom.

Hi, son.

I couldn't just leave him
in the shelter, mom.

It's Christmas Eve.

Then I guess we're just going
to have to get him up

To antler Ridge.


Charlie.

Well...

that was kind of fun.

Okay, it was fun.

Come on. Let's go.


â™ª sleep in heavenly peace. â™ª



Before Prancer
joins the rest of the team,

there is a readin by yours
truly, of course

Of the night before Christmas.

[clears throat]

<i>"It was the night before Christmas</i>

<i>"when all through the house,</i>

<i>"not a creature was stirring,</i>

<i>not even a mouse."</i>


You think Prancer will be
able to get to antler Ridge

From here okay?

Oh, I think we're close enough.

Ha!

[dog barking]

Whatcha doing in there, Jim?

Where have you been?

Get me out of here.

Oh, clam up!

'ere he rode out of sight,

<i>Merry Christmas to all,</i>
<i>and to all a good night."</i>

And now for the main event.

[applause and cheering]

I'm gonna miss you, Prancer.


You have to go.


Go.


[Charlie sniffling]

It's okay, boy.

It's time to go home.



[dramatic music]

â™ª    â™ª

[crowd gasps]


<i>(man) You see that?</i>

Did you see that, sheriff?

<i>(Klock) What?</i>

<i>Oo!</i>

What'd I miss?

What did I miss?

Whoosh!

I think it's time to go home.

What about you guys?

Let's go home.

deep in your heart, â™ª

â™ª then things that aren't
possible suddenly are. â™ª

â™ª if you believe, â™ª

â™ª a wish on a star
might really come true, â™ª

â™ª and they do. â™ª

â™ª if you believe, reindeer can fly, â™ª

â™ª even though it seems impossible â™ª

â™ª on Christmas Eve night, â™ª

â™ª while children sleep,
Santa comes by, â™ª

â™ª delivering gifts only if...
if you believe. â™ª

â™ª so run to the edge
of your dreams, â™ª

â™ª and jump over the side
at least once in your life. â™ª

â™ª it's time to start
spreading your wings â™ª

â™ª and take to the Sky. â™ª

â™ª and all things illogical
can possibly be, â™ª

â™ª then open your mind
and repeat after me, â™ª

â™ª "anything you can imagine
can be achieved  â™ª

â™ª if you believe." â™ª

â™ª if you believe. â™ª

â™ª ooh-ooh-oh-ooh. â™ª

The end
