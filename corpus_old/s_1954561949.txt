      It's Thursday,
      December 29th.

      We left the hotel
      about an hour ago

  and everyone's sleeping.

  But I... I can't...
  I can't sleep because...

          See that?

          Surprise.

  Ah... That's your daddy.
  That's the best daddy.

  Look at him.
  Say, "Hi, Daddy".

The van.
Hmm?

Stop the van!
  Stop the van!

Yeah. Let it go!

Whoa! Yeah, bro!

Oh, get it all out!
  Get it all out.
You okay?

  You okay?

That is disgusting.
I'm fine.

  It's making my eyes water.
  It smells like straight
  whiskey.

  Some nice greasy
  hangover food will
  be good for you.

Come on.
Yeah, let's get
  some hangover food.

Mmm-mmm-mmm...

Oh! Round two!

This is all
                    my fault.
Well done.

                Shut up!

Oh, yeah, man.
  Eat them beans.

  Beans and rice
  mixing together...
    Are you serious?

...having a party
  in that stomach.

          Are you serious?

  Are you kidding me?
  Make a web series out of this.

              Just stop, man.

      "Cole Pukes.
      The Untold Story."
               Mark, cut it out.

Why?
  Give me a little spirit.
  Why not?

                Would you stop?
          What? It's...

      It's annoying.
      You're being obnoxious.
      Stop filming!

You're looking over
        our little dossier?

Yeah, yeah, I'm actually...
Evil awaits us, huh?

        Turn off the fucking
        camera, Mark!

  Dude, chill.
  And your eyes are beautiful.

Give me the camera!
          Give me the camera.

Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
Dude! Dude,
  you'll hurt the camera!

    Sorry, I just gotta tell ya,
      my wife and I are such
      big fans of your show.

Huge fans.
Thank you very much.

    We have your entire
    first season on DVD.

    I don't know how you guys,
    you know, go into all those
    places and spend the night.

       I get scared in the dark!

      I don't mean to be nosy,
      but what are you guys
      doing here?

      Are you going up
      to Hillcrest?

Look at you, baby.

            Baby, where are you?
            There you are.

Hi.

Hmm...

What are you doing?
Nothing.

                So, how'd it go
                with Mark?

    Oh, I think
    we're all good.

            Yeah, it went okay?

        Yeah.

              Good. That's good.

          I don't care. If we
          don't get anything,
          we don't get anything.

        If they cancel the show,
          that's no big deal.

        I just want it to be...

              I want to be real.

You gotta
        stop worrying about it.
        Okay?

                    All right.
                           Okay?

                  Yeah. Yeah,
                I'm not, just...

                      Just what?

    Just 100 episodes
    into a hit television show?

            Oh, I'm so worried,
            so worried.

        It's amazing.
       Hey, oh! A big part of...

You look so stupid!

                He does not!
  You're like a chipmunk!

  Well, he says
  whatever he wants.
  He looks like an asshole.

Oh, my God,
  he's gonna choke.

  This is where you
  start getting stuck.
  Thank you very much.

          Oh, my God!
  Oh, no!

Seven, six, five, four,
  three, two, one!

  No! Open your mouth.
  Open your mouth.

  Open it, open it, open it.
  Open your mouth.
          Oh, my God!

All right.

    Whoo!

  That deserves
  a nice handshake.
              Wow!

      Hey, either way,
    the pretzels were delicious.

  Yeah, okay, I don't want to
  pay for anything tonight.

Well, come on,
            you're $100 richer.

        Yeah. Another round.
                        Barkeep!

            Barkeep! Barkeep!
            You can't say that.

                    Ready?

  Why would you be
  able to twist your arm
  all the way around?

    Oh, my God!
              Ew! Ew! Ew!

You got this, Cole?
            You got that? Yeah!
Nope, nope, nope.

  Humans shouldn't
  have to do that.

          Guys, I can do...
    Oh, my God!

Oh, no, no,
                no, no, no!

  Who wants to kiss me?
          There we go.

Bare skin.
Oh,
    there's the Wolfman!

  Ow! That hurts so good!

            All right, you're
            eating that pretzel.

  I'll give you $75 to
  eat that pretzel.

  I'm sorry I called
  you a barkeep.

      This is <i> GhostTrackers,</i>
      episode 100,
      Hillcrest Sanatorium.

            Camera A. Camera B.

        All right, I'm rolling.

                        Hey, Ty.
                  Yeah.

          As you can see,
          we are packing up
          for what is sure to be

        one of the most
        exciting investigations
        we have ever done.

        The location we're
        going to is shrouded

        with so much
        secrecy and lore

    that we're pretty sure
    we're in store for
    one heck of a night.

  Yeah! We're the lucky bastards
  that get to go in first!

Oh, shit!

            All right,
           let's watch it, guys.

God, I wanna get there.
Did we
  pass a Stoney...

A Stoney Hill... Lane?
A Stoney Hill...

               Stoney Hill Lane?

Stoney Hill Lane?
   They're all stony hill lanes.

The phone
                fucking keeps
                freezing, man.

Man,
            it's all our phones.

    Okay, so, Sam, why don't
    you tell us and our viewers
    what's going on?

        Well, what's going on is
        we are currently lost,

  which is a little embarrassing
  as we are obviously

      a van full of people
    who can find the paranormal,

            but no one can read
            a fricking map!

        It happens even to us.
        Sometimes we get lost,

      but these places are
      in the middle of nowhere.

All right,
  so can you tell us
  why we're still lost?

  What's going on right now?

Lost.

  Sometimes you have to let
  a spirit guide you.

  I don't know, I think the
  scariest places should be
  the most difficult to find.

  That's how I feel
  personally, so...
                           Guys!

    What?
                    I found it.

Got it?
                       Let's go!

                      Come on.
      Spirit probably told her.

              It's fucking cold.
              Let's go!
  Probably came in... Okay.

          Found it. That's done.
                   Yeah, I know.
                    We got that.

Wow!

Oh, boy.

  All right, that's it.
  It looks...

  ...pretty creepy,
  like we thought it would.

  This is a big one for us.

This is like our Super Bowl.
This place is famous.

Oh, my God.
            Do you see it's
            all boarded up?

That's Irwin.
That's Irwin, the guy
  who set this all up for us.

Oh, my God,
  it's amazing.

Irwin?
        Yeah, I'm Irwin.

Hey,
  we're the GhostTrackers.

    I know who you guys are.
    I watched your show.

          I watched just
          the beginning of it.

        You're Tyler, right?
  That's me.

              Hey, I'm Irwin.
              How are ya?
  Hey, thanks so much.

        Samantha.
                Sam, you know me
                 from the phone.

      Yes. Cole. How are ya?
      What's cooking?
  Sir. Really good.

  Hey. Mark, crack him up.
  Oh, man, pleasure.
  Hey, yeah. Oh, thanks, man.

    How are you? The one
    with the jokes and the
    wisecracks, yeah.

    Oh, Bridge, how are you?
    How are you?
                      Good.

    Always with the equipment
    and stuff like that.

      Great to meet you.
          Welcome, you guys.

              This is, like,
             a part of the show?

Yeah. Yeah,
     you're on camera right now.

          Hey, Irwin, we're real
          excited to get inside
          the Sanatorium, so...

        Sanatorium, technically,
          it's now the Hillcrest
          Nursing Home.

      The Sanatorium closed down
      years and years ago.

           Then it was abandoned
            for a couple years.
  Uh-huh.

              Then, around 1974,
            some people came in.

      They renovated the inside
      and they made it
      a nursing home.

        It's the
        Hillcrest Nursing Home,
        so technically,

        you're looking
        at the abandoned
        Hillcrest Nursing Home.

Well, you think we
  can get inside,
  take a quick look or...

Front door's locked.
    There's a padlock.

    I can't find the key.
    We can't get in today.

  I got a guy coming tomorrow

  with one of those hydraulic
  power bolt cutter things.

  We can cut
  the bolt on the door.
  So we can get in tomorrow.

What if we get,
  like, a state trooper
  or something

  just to, like,
  shotgun it open?

No, no, no, no, no.

Look around today.
I appreciate it, man.

Don't break nothing.
I'm not...

      If you break something,
      I'm a ghost, 'cause
      I'm dead meat.

All right. Yeah.
              Yeah.

No, man,
  I don't want you
  haunting me, Irwin.

What? Oh, my God,
  it's happening.

You're the man.
  You're the man. Okay.
All right.

You're the strong man.
  Okay?
I am big.

Yeah. Yeah.

All right,
  yep, and in...

  And there we go.

  What are you...
  What are you zooming in on?

The window.
  It's a scary window.
I know it's the...

No, it's not scary.
  It's the same shot
  we always get, man.

It's a pretty
  scary window, man.

  You're doing what we
  normally do. I want to
  do something different.

Oh, shit.
You got it.

  The sky's the limit, man.
  We can go anywhere with this.

  We're gonna... Why can't we
  have 10 million viewers?

  But that's what I'm saying.
  You have 1,800.

      I have 150,000.
      You need to step up
      your game, dude.

  Great, it's our 100th
  episode, that's 100...

    That means 100 fucking
    episodes of the same thing.
  Episode.

  Watch the DVD,
  you're gonna see
  the same shit.

                      Right.

Two more.

  What the fuck was that?
              Did you hear that?

Nursing home came and
  went before I started, uh,
  taking care of the property.

           That was '74, or '76.

               Before your time.
    Yeah, before I started
    taking care of the place.

           Didn't those two boys
            go missing a couple
            years ago?

  Nobody wants to talk about it.

      Between you and me
      and the grand piano,

  I don't think anything
  happened to them in there.

  I think they were just playing
  around somewhere,

  and some pedophile freak was
  passing through the area,
  scooped them up.

  If they were playing
  around this property,
  I would have known.

      This place is huge.
    I mean, you're only one man.
      You only have two eyes.

    I'm in charge of this place.
     I'm in charge of everything
      that comes and goes.

            I see what
            goes on here, okay?

              It's my job.
           Irwin, do you believe
            in ghosts?

  Do I believe in ghosts?

Yeah.

  I believe in ghosts.

  As far as this place, nah.

  This is just

  a dumpy old,
  scary old building.
  It's scary looking.

  You'll see what it's like.
  It's just a bunch of rooms.

    Let's check out this, uh...
    I saw this window here.

        What the hell?

Oh, hey, man.
    No, no, no, no.

Irwin's over there,
  so just keep it cool.

  All right.
    All right?

All right.

You getting this?
Yeah.

            All right,
           ladies and gentlemen.

  You're gonna get
  a little preview here.
  So, uh...

Watch the glass.
                  I know.

All right,
  go, go, go.

Oh! Jesus Christ!

    Mark, you weren't trying to
    go in there, were you?

No, man.
          Okay, deal's a deal.

  No, I got you, dude.
          Okay. You go in today,
          I lose my job.

  I got you, man.
  We were just
  taking a peek, that's all.

  All right. I will.
           Okay. You're the man.

                Fucking asshole.

                   Jesus Christ.

        "For our 100th episode,
        we will investigate
        claims of apparitions,

    "disembodied voices,
    and the apparent abductions
    that have happened here."

            How's that? Good?

I think that was perfect.

          All right, action.

  Just behind me is the
  infamous Hillcrest Sanatorium.

                Built in 1908...

It's all right. Relax.
Let's do it again.

            Just behind me
            is the infamous
           Hillcrest Sanatorium.

                  Oh, fuck me!

            With the discovery
            of antibio... Um...

                And, uh...

              Many died
              and went insane.

              Griz... Grizzly...

I'm guessing it's
  for the little kids or
  something like that,

            but we could
            probably spin it.

Right? About the patients
        that stayed here?
Yeah, that makes sense.

          Does that make sense?
          Cool.

      So, uh, Cole and I
      discovered these flowers
      left by family members

  of the poor souls that
  lost their lives here in
  this gruesome sanatorium.

    I think tonight,
    during our investigation,

  I'm going to be dedicating
  everything I can to...

  Hey, man. Wait, wait.
  Wait. Hold on, man.
  What? What?

There was something
  in the window.

What?
  There was something
  in that window.

  It looked like a...
  It looked like a little kid.

There was something...
There's a little kid
  in the window?

  There was something
  in the window. There was
  a kid in that window, man.

Okay. Get this.
  Get this then.

Hey, little kid!

  If you're in the window,
  show yourself!

Dude...
  No, man. Check the tape.

Dude,
  you're doing good, man.

  You don't have to
  ham it up here.

  I'm serious, man,
  there was a kid in there!

            Okay.

  <i> ...dedicating everything</i>
  <i> I can to...</i>

  <i> Wait, wait, wait...</i>
  <i> Hold on, man.</i>

Right there,
  right in the window,
  then it goes away.

          I see it.

No!

                 I think there's
                something there.

           It could be a shadow,
            but there's...

            There is something.
   There's definitely something.

          No, do it again.
          I didn't see anything.

  <i> ...dedicating everything</i>
  <i> I can to...</i>

  <i> Hey, man. Wait, wait, wait.</i>
  <i> Wait. Hold on, man.</i>
      <i> What?</i>

A little boy?
                Yeah!

Say you saw
  a monster or something.

   Well, maybe it was a monster.
    We'll find out when
    we get there, right?

I was there,
          I didn't see anything.

    Either way, it's definitely
    worth checking out.

              When we go inside,
              we'll have to...
              I don't know.

                Take a good look
               around that room.

                  Maybe see what
                we can draw out.

        Haven't even gone inside
          and we're already,

            maybe seeing things.

        Maybe it's our emotions
        getting the best of us.

            Either way,
           it's pretty exciting.

  All right, so it's 4:30 a.m.
  and I'm trying to stay up.

    We're all trying to stay up
    as long as possible.

  You know, so tomorrow night
  no one's slacking around
  or anything like that.

        But my buddy Cole
        is sleeping.

      Might need a little drink
      to wake him up. Hunh?

    A little wake up call. Hmm?

Hello, oh, hello.

Hey!

  Man, you're so...
            Really?

  Dude, don't break
  the camera, man.

              Jesus Christ, man.
              What the fuck?

                  Oh...

  Only one person who that
  could be at 4:30 a.m.

  Someone's getting ass...

            Hi!
  Why are you guys filming?

  Someone left something on,
  like, Tyler and Sam's door,

  It has to do with Hillcrest.
  We're in their room now.

Okay...

You guys want info
  on Hillcrest? Here it is.

What the fuck?
Yeah.

And here he is.
    Richard Howl.

Holy shit.
What?

Wait, let me get this.
Oh, my God,
  this is great.

Wait. Hold up, Ty.

This was taken on
            New Year's Day?
Holy shit!

           Richard Howl murdered
            three children

        on New Year's Eve, 1955.

        He brutally murders
        the three kids
        and then hangs himself.

Oh, my God.
Yup.

  So, holiday party
  right before
  it all happened,

  three of these kids, dead.

How old were they?

11...
        The youngest one was 8.

              11, 11 and 8.
              Just little ones.

Is that the police report?
Can I get that?

Some of his ribs
  were removed.
What?

And it's actually
  like this.
It's that way?

  Part of this lung is gone.

What the...
Wait.
  Why did they do that?

  He had TB and he was
  getting experimented on.

What?
Yes,
  Hillcrest was kind of...

From here it says
    that they would do...

            Yeah, exactly, Cole.
              Experiments.

         It was like the patient
        had nothing to live for.

Fourteen people
  in a room? Jesus.

  I'm just really scared.

          I don't want to
          go tomorrow.

  Well, it's just gonna
  get scarier.
      I think it's really scary.

I didn't know the kids
        were so young.
This is what we do.

  This is what we do.
    I didn't think it was
    real, guys. I'm sorry.

                  Don't worry.
                  I'll be there.

          You guys are in
          for such a treat.

  I cannot wait for tomorrow.

      Is it tomorrow yet?
    Technically, it is tomorrow.

              Technically,
              we're about to go!

                        Whoo!

      And, uh...

  It's on the anniversary
  that he hung himself.

Wow.
There it is. Yes.

    The Hillcrest Sanatorium.

Oh, come on.

He's wearing different
  clothes than yesterday.

                      Great.

  The last thing
  I said to him,

  I specifically said,
  "Please wear
  the same clothes".

Awesome.

      I kinda plowed earlier
      before you guys came.

  A little bit, not plowed,
  but I kinda stomped it down.

        I'm ready to go in,
        you ready to go in?
                    Let's do it.

                  Okay.

  You all over 18, right?

            Most of us. Yeah.

  Okay. Ready?
  Here we go.

      Might be a couple of rats,
      but don't worry.

  Okay, there's a lot
  of water here.
  Might be some ice.

        Now, the Sanatorium
        was built in 1908

  as just a wellness center
  for people
  in the countryside.

  It was supposed to have
  about 30 patients.

          Then, when the
          white plague hit,

  there was well over 500 people
  in here at any given time.

    Just squeezed in every nook
    and cranny in the facility.

                  It was a very,
                 very sad place.

       People from all over were
        trying to get in here.

So, how many people
  were still stuck here?

        About 1,000 people
        died in here.

What?

1,000 people
  died here in five years.

During the height of
  the plague, this was
  the draining room.

        When somebody would die
        from their tuberculosis

            and at the peak
            of the plague,

            that was happening,
            like, every day,

          they would take
          the dead bodies and
          there were poles here,

        and they would hang
       the bodies by their neck.

        but just, you know,
        keep them up from here.

      And they would make
    an incision from the sternum

            all the way down
            to the groin

      so that all the fluids
    in the body would drain out.

      Back then they didn't know
      and they thought

          by removing the fluids
         before they shipped the
        bodies out for disposal,

            they could contain
            the infection to
            the facility. Okay?

                  Bridget?
                        Yes.

    We should set up
    a static camera right here.

                  All right.
  I want to get full
  coverage of this room.

Okay.
Oh, guys. Guys.

            Ooh...

  I feel a lot of
  static energy right here.

      Right here.

  It's pulling me in.

Irwin, come here.
What?

        Feel this.

  Put your hands here.
  You feel that?

  Nah, man.

  What are you talking about?
  It's right here.

  Nah, nothing there.

  This is its origin, here.
  Right here.

During the
  nursing home period,
  this was...

   As you might be able to tell,
    this was the kitchen.

  You know, stoves,
  ovens, sinks.

  But before that,
  this exact same room,

  back in the Sanatorium days,

        was the autopsy room
        in the morgue.

What?
                  Yeah.

So we're talking
  a lot of bodies
  in this room.

  A lot of people who went
  through probably horribly
  traumatic deaths.

        And this is where
        they were stored.

      This is where
      they were dissected.

            Tyler! Come in here.
              Feel this.

    It's like 20 degrees colder
    in here than in there.

  It's freezing in here.
          It's freezing in here.

          Cole, get in here!

          It's definitely...
          It's noticeably colder
          in this room.

This place is evil.

  Anybody else's limbs
  hurt right now?

Like my limbs, like my elbows
  and all my joints, right?
Yeah.

          Between you and me,
          I think it's just cold
          'cause it's winter.

                      You know?
      Yeah.

       Watch out for hoses here.
        There's a lot of...

Whoa!
          Jesus Christ! Fuck me!

        It's all right.
       It's just something fell.

What'd you see, Mark?
               Oh! I don't know.

What fell?
          Let's get the fuck
          out of here.

This doesn't feel safe, guys.

       So he was right up there?

  Yeah. Right up there where
  the plaster's missing.

        That crazy light
        wasn't there back then,
        but they came in

    and found him dangling right
      from that spot there.

      I know you can hear us,
      Richard Howl.

    I know you're
    watching us right now.
    I can feel you.

        You did that
        to those kids, Richard?

            You did that
            to those kids?

        Try that on me.
        Try that on me!

Okay. Uh...

I think we can cut?
Let's do it.

Dick Howl.
Real tough, Mark.

All right.
  Action!

          This is the room where
          the infamous patient
          Richard Howl lived.

      Richard suffered
      from a severe strain
      of tuberculosis

          which slowly consumed
          him from within.

        He unfortunately
        volunteered for many
        experimental surgeries.

     These surgeries would later
      drive him completely mad.

    He had eight rib cage bones
    removed from his chest

              and one of
            his lungs collapsed.

          It was in this room
          on New Year's Eve,

            December 31st, 1955,

            that Richard
            took his own life

    after brutally bludgeoning
    three children to death

        while they were
        sleeping in their beds.

This is where
              they were killed.

Irwin.

        Don't sneak up
        on me like that.
            Sorry.

                 The three kids,
                viciously beaten
                  in this room.

  What happened in here
  creeps me out
  when I'm by myself.

       This is definitely a room
        that we gotta stay in.

I want you guys
  to be extra careful.

    It is really, really
    dark down here.

      That is what was called
      "The Passage to Paradise".

  Dead bodies on gurneys were
  rolled through this maze
  for waiting hearses.

  The doctors were thinking
  it would stop the spread
  of infection.

  It also would have
  relieve the patients
  from seeing death.

This is a sad place.

It is really dark
    down here.

      Actually,
      let's turn off our lights

      to show you guys
     just how dark it really is.

      Get 'em all off.

Ladies and gentlemen,
  this is what we see
  when the lights go out.

    And we can only see the LCD
    screens on these cameras.

      Infrared.

      No infrared.

    Infrared.

    No infrared.

  Infrared.

      No infrared.

That's pretty dark.
Told ya.

        That concludes the tour.

Sorry. No gift shop.

We can't thank you enough.
Yeah, thanks, Irwin.

It's been amazing.
We appreciate it.

          Anything for you guys.

  Just put that thing as
  far away as possible.
  I don't want to hear it.

      So, these are
      motion detectors.

  If any mass or energy passes
  through, an alarm will sound.

                Okay.

Hmm?

  Hillcrest Sanatorium.
  Everything's getting set up.

  The sun's about to go down

      and things are
      about to get wild.

          Oh, fuck!

  I feel like
  I just got tripped.

  There's nothing around that
  could have tripped me.

        Maybe it was myself.

I don't know.
      Could have been.

      But I don't think so.

  Anybody here
  trying to freak me out?

  Trying to scare me
  out of here?

  You're gonna have to do
  better than that.

             I'm all alone here.

            Nobody else is here.
           There's nothing here.

       But I ate it pretty hard.

      Gonna be sore tomorrow.

                   What is that?

                           Guys?

                          Hello?

                          Guys?

Fuck!

          Found a bowling ball.

          Fucking asshole.
          Why would you do that?

    It's New Year's Eve night.

   56 years since Richard Howl's
    brutal rampage.

      We're here at the
      Hillcrest Sanatorium,

      about to enter, record
      and document some of
      the strange phenomena

    that has been reported here.

      Any last words for us?

               Happy New Year's.

Happy New Year.
Happy New Year, Irwin.

           Thank you. Thank you.

            All right.

          So our cameras
          are all set up.

          We've got this
          whole place covered.

    We've got the kitchen.

      We've got every hallway,
      the children's wing.

     We've got outside in front.

          We've also got
          motion detectors
          in Howl's room,

        the children's wing,
        and there's also one
        right behind me

       so that Mark doesn't pull
        a single thing.

        Thank you, Bridget.
        We've got a great
        opportunity here

     to capture some really good
      activity in this building.

      Let's break up into teams.

        Sam and I are
        gonna be one team.

      And of course,
      Mark and Cole another.

    Bridget's gonna stay here
   and monitor all our activity.

            Let's do this, guys.
              One, two, three...

Lights out!

                      Let's go!

Okay.

Night vision on, guys.

Oh, careful!

                    Damn it.

Watch your step, okay?

  A lot of boards with
  nails in 'em. Watch out.

All right.
              Copy that.

Set.

  This is an EMF detector.

      Ghosts, spirits,
      they're said to give off
      electromagnetic energy.

      If one gets close to me,
      this is gonna spike.

        Any people who were
        tortured in here,
       we're not gonna hurt you.

        Just come close to us.

      We don't try to
      just spice things up.

  If I'm not picking
  up anything,
  there's nothing in here.

  Sometimes that happens.

      I'm Mark, this is Cole.

     We're about to descend down
     to the Passage to Paradise.

    Start our investigation.

            Here we go.

          Oh, dude,
          it smells so bad.

        This is gross.

There's
  water on the ground.
  That's nice.

  What's going on in here?

  Yeah, this is...
  I'd live here.

      Jesus.

            Dude!
    Oh, Jesus Christ!

    Dude, dude, dude!
    Shut up! Come on.
    Over here.

Jesus!

What the fuck?

                   What is this?

Look at the wall.

What the fuck is that?

          There's just drawings.

They're people
  on the wall.

Looks like a dragon
        about to attack a devil
        holding a baby.

            Look at that.
            Look at the dragon.
  Right.

Oh, look at
            the baby flying out.

Holy shit!
  That is that.

  It's fucking...

There's just
          one singular bathroom.

Gross.

What the fuck?
      What is that?

                   What is that?

      What did we just see?
      What did we just see?

          Look at it.
          Go down, go down.

  Ready? And, hello.

Oh...

This is Tyler and Samantha.

      We're in the dining room
     headed towards the kitchen.

Do you hear that?

              No, what?

I thought...

    Nothing, forget about it.
    It's nothing.

Dude, dude!
What? What?

Shit! Shit! Shit!
                    What?

  There's a big spider!
  Spider up... Spider!

  There's a spider over here?
    Dude, there's a spider on...

      Get it off my face.
      Get it off my face.
      Get it off my face!

  You don't have
  a spider on your face.

  There you go. Got it.

You okay? You okay?

                          Yeah.
        Can you make it?

Fuck you, dude!

              All right.

Oh, what the...

                Shit!

You all right?

  There's all
  sorts of stuff here.

Whoa.

  What? Oh, nice.

Why?

Why?

  Yes!

Got to do
  something with that.

          So, I, uh...
        So, I found this gurney.

        I don't know who put it
        here, but it's here.

       I'm gonna lay down on it.

          Maybe feel some
          spirits go through me.

    Maybe just listen for them.

            They're coming.

            Oh, yeah!

Just listen.

              Whoa! Oh, shit!

    Hey, what do you want to do?
    You want to move on?

Shh! I heard something.

  What?

      Footsteps right over here.

    I'm gonna call Bridge, okay?

           <i> Samantha to Bridget.</i>

      <i> Hey, can you roll</i>
      <i> back the kitchen feed</i>
      <i> about a minute or so,</i>

      <i> and tell us if you</i>
      <i> see or hear anything?</i>

                You got it.

<i> Copy, thanks.</i>

            <i> Hey, what do you</i>
            <i> want to do?</i>

           <i> You want to move on?</i>

        <i> Shh! I heard something.</i>

                      <i> What?</i>

    <i> Footsteps right over here.</i>

            <i> Hey, what do you</i>
            <i> want to do?</i>

           <i> You want to move on?</i>

        <i> Shh! I heard something.</i>

                      <i> What?</i>

    <i> Footsteps right over here.</i>

                    <i> What?</i>

    <i> Footsteps right over here.</i>

          <i> Hey,</i>
        <i> what do you want to do?</i>
          <i> You want to move on?</i>

                <i> Shh! I heard...</i>

           <i> You want to move on?</i>
                           <i> Shh!</i>

           <i> You want to move on?</i>
                        <i> Shh!</i>

           <i> You want to move on?</i>
                        <i> Shh!</i>

Hey, guys.
       So I reviewed the footage
        a couple of times,

      and, Tyler, when you
      approached the piping
      in the center of the room,

          there's definitely
          something interesting
          in front of you.

      I can't say for sure
      what it is until I analyze
      the footage more, but...

        <i> I think we might have</i>
        <i> a possible orb.</i>

        A possible orb?
        I knew it.

    I knew we had
    something right over here.

        We just heard it.

    If you're still with us,
    please let us know!

    Give us some kind of sign,
    some kind of signal.

  Anything, any kind of noise.
  Don't be afraid.

    This is a digital recorder.

              We use it because
              the microphone can
              pick up things

              that the human ear
              can't hear.

                        Hello?

    If there's someone in here,
    you can say something
    into the little red light.

    If you have anything to say,
      we'll be able to hear you.

           That thing just fell.

              I was just
            laying on the gurney
              for 30 minutes,

               nothing going on.

              Gurney just fell
              out of nowhere.

    No explanation,
    just fell, just lost all...

               Something doesn't
                want us here.

            Something's saying,
            "Get out".

            Something's saying,
            "Not in my house.

              "You're not laying
              in my room."

    There's paranormal activity
    going on right here,

        something's paranormal.

            We have to go,
            we have to move on,

               we're going up to
                the freezer room
                right now.

                Hello?

                  Mark?

            Sam and Tyler,
            Mark and Cole,

      can I get a quick location
      check from you guys?

      <i> Hey, Bridge,</i>
      <i> Tyler and I are just</i>
      <i> outside the medical wing.</i>

<i> Yeah, me and Cole are on</i>
<i> our way into the freezer room.</i>

                Hello?

        Is someone there?

  We're filming in here
  so it's...

<i> Bridget.</i>

            <i> Is everything okay?</i>

          Yes, I'm fine.
          You scared the shit
          out of me.

  All right, set that.
  You good?

  Yeah, that'll work.
      All right.

        But this...

      People that perished from
      the tuberculosis were
      brought down to this room.

        They were strung up by
        their necks and sliced,

          from their sternums
          down to their groins,

            releasing all
            bodily fluids.

      They didn't know how
      to control the disease.

        You want to get
        some promo stills?
        I got my camera here.

                  Yeah.
              All right.

              Good idea.

  All right, hold on.

  There you are.

  Give me more face.
              All right.

  Dude, dude, dude!

What? What?

              Cole! Dude!

Are you all right, man?

              Cole!

          Dude, come on, man.
          I can't see shit.

Cole.

          Dude,
        what are you doing, man?

  All right, good stuff, dude.
  Can't see.

                Christ!

              God...

  Dude, the camera's
  on the ground?
  Good job, asshole!

  Goddamn it!

  All right.
  Funny, dude.
  Great job.

  Cole!

  Dude, come on, man.
  I don't have time
  for this shit.

  Seriously, man.

  What the fuck?

  Dude, what are you doing?

  You want to break
  the fucking camera?

Careful.

  Cole!

  Dude, what are you doing?

  What... Dude!

  Dude.

  What the fuck, man?

  What do you mean, what?
  You're such an asshole.

              What is...
              Did we get it?

Did we...
  Kiss my ass, man!

  You wanna break the camera?
  You wanna break our things?

  Don't be an asshole, man.

This is Tyler and Sam.

        We're in the medical
        wing in the building.

              People who entered
              this room were
              extremely brave.

      This is where the most
    drastic measures were taken.

Shh, shh, shh, shh.

I heard something.

                Shh.

        Tyler to Mark, come in.

                Tyler to Mark.

        <i> Yes. What's up, Tyler?</i>

        Hey, man,
        how's the medical wing?

<i> I don't care if</i>
          <i> you don't believe me,</i>
          <i> all right?</i>

My heart's
        pounding right now.

      Is it music?

      Yeah, that's what I think.

             Let's try this way.

              So weird,
              it was right here.

            It was coming
            from right here.

          I think it's coming
          from upstairs now.

        It's crazy, right?
        Like it keeps changing.

  Whoa!

    What? What? What?

        The curtain just moved.

  What do you mean
  the curtain just moved?

        I mean,
        the curtain moved, Sam.

            It's just the wind.

No, no, wait, wait,
    wait, wait, no, wait.

  Why?

                I don't know.
                I feel weird.
                I'm nervous.

          Don't be nervous.

            Come on.

Where'd it go?

Fuck! It's a radio.
What?

Fucking Mark
  hid the radio.

  Calm down. Calm down.
  You don't know if it was Mark.

      This is the exact
      kind of shit he pulls.

        I'm done dealing
        with this guy.

  Oh, come on.
              What?

How many times
  have you said that?

            I mean, I work so
            hard for this show.

            He does nothing
            except fuck around.
            Look at this.

Let me see it.

Hey, babe,
  how did Mark
  make a radio work

  with no batteries

  and not plugged in?
                        Well.

  He could have
  rigged something up.

      There's a million places
      where he could have...

Don't get
  overexcited, okay? Just...

  I'm not overexcited!
          Yes, you are!

          Just... I just wish
          that you'd calm down.

        Come on!

        I know. I know you
        care about the show.

  I know you're only looking
  out for the show.

  Nobody knows that
  more than me, baby.

  I'm sick of dealing
  with this guy.

      Wait, what time is it?

Ten, nine,
          eight, seven, six,

    five, four, three, two, one!

        Happy New Year!

                      Whoo!

          Hey! Happy New Year!
    Happy New Year!

  100 shows! 100 shows!

Where are you, Bridge?

  Happy New Year!

               Now it's my turn!
                Happy New Year!

                Oh, I love you.

  Happy New Year!

    Reality. This year, this
    clothing that you can wear,

        just looks like a black
        shirt on regular light.

        When infrared light
        hits it, it's a totally
        different ballgame.

    There's patterns and, like,
    a maze of mystery on it.

          And, I don't know.
        I think that could sell.

        I think it'd sell a lot.

        Make coats, make pants.

          Surprise!

              Aw, yeah.

GhostTrackers,
        we're all playing with,
        like...

  Um... Hey, guys.
  I'm sorry, I don't mean to
  interrupt. I just...

    Yeah, we have some big news.

I'm pregnant! I'm pregnant!
What?

    Oh, my God!
    Oh, my God!

    I knew it!
    I totally knew it!

                Did you know?

  Oh, no, that
  I wasn't pregnant.

                We've been...
  I'm in shock still. I...

  I know, I just told him,
  like, literally a second ago,

    and I don't know if
    you guys knew this...

        for a really long time.
            Uncle Mark says hi.

Wow, that's so...

  I didn't think this episode
  would get any better,
  but it just did.

That's really great,
  you guys.

You're all fucking uptight,
  you're having a kid,

it's New Years, just relax!
Yeah,
      I know those things.

Yeah, okay, well...

And I also know
  you put a fucking radio
  in the bathroom.

  I didn't put a fucking...
  Why would I put a fucking
  radio in the bathroom?

  Why would I put a radio
  in the bathroom?

And for our 100th episode,
      we got something new.

    Sam, tell us what we got.

      Oh! Well, actually,
      Bridget's the expert.

      I just call it
      the Sam-Cam.

            It's the Sam-Cam,
            but really
           it's just a body cam.

       Um, and it records audio,
        it's got a flash drive.

      And it's just a tiny thing
      so she can be handsfree

              while she does
              the investigation.

  Yes, so from now on
  in the sanatorium,

    whatever I see,
    you will see.

          We're here inside
          Richard Howl's room,

          and we set up
          some motion detectors.

    That'll give us an
    audio alarm if anything
    breaks that barrier

        and comes in
        around that doorway.

      I also set up this chair,

    right underneath where
    Richard Howl killed himself.

              I'm gonna sit here

      and hopefully gather
      some evidence for
      our investigation.

      Richard, are you here?

    I know you suffered a lot
    while you lived here.

  You had a hard life.

  But what you did
  to those kids,
  that was unacceptable.

  What are you doing?

      Just trying to
      provoke him a little bit.

  All right, Mark.

If you're here,
          just give us a sign.

            We just want to know
           if you're still here.

  If you're here,
  touch my arm, Richard.

        Come on.

  I'm gonna wait here
  all night.

  I know this is where
  you killed yourself.

          I don't care
          how long it takes.

      All right,
      now can we
      try it my way?

    Sitting quietly in the dark.

                  I'm so done
                 with this, man.

        What is up Tyler's ass?

               It's just like...

        Just trying to make this
         show better. That's it.

I know, man.

            He doesn't get that.
  It's his thing, man.

Wait, do you feel that?

                          What?

  It's right here.

Dude, what are you?
        Getting possessed again?

            What are you doing?

            Don't steal my
           goose bump line, man.

  I'm not stealing your
  fucking goose bump line.

            It's a heat.

           Dude, you're freaking
            me out, man.
    There's a heat. Shut up.

It is warm over here.

              It's warm.
              What is that?

What is that?

          It's here.
      Yeah.

            It's here.

        Whoa. It's hot.

          Yeah.

    You feel okay?

        You feel okay?

            Yeah.

      I don't feel good.
          What?

      I don't feel good, man.

Dude. You gonna throw up?

            No, it's...

    Dude, you're
    freaking me out.

    I know. Oh, God, it's...

        Dude!
        Oh, God. No, no, no.

        Bro, chill.
    Dude, give me a second.

      Dude, you're
      freaking me out.

        It's too hot.
    What is that?

    What the fuck?

      Dude, that sounded
      like a little girl, man.

Are you the little girl
  that was hurt in this room?

  We're your friends.
  We won't hurt you or anything.
  We just...

      Why don't you
      show yourself?

  Dude, what the...

  What's that?
          What was that?

    What was that?
    What was that?

  Guys, get down to
  the children's ward now!
  Now!

      We got real
      fucking activity.

    Real activity.
    Class A EVPs.

              Right now.
              Get down here.

              Dude, oh my God.

      Dude, that was real.
            That was...

  That's the first time in
  nine years, that's a real...

            You want to go
            check it out?
            Go for it.

  I mean, of course,
  I want to check it out.
  You don't want to go?

              Something could
              happen here.

          I feel like
          I should stick around.

              All right.

          I've waited here
          long enough.

            Are you sure?
            Nervous, yes?

          I think something
          could happen here too.

  Okay. Well,
  good luck with that.

  I'm going,
  if you're sure.

                  Yeah.

  Okay. I love you.

                 I love you too.

        Bye.

Oh, fuck.

  Ty, my battery just died.

Oh, shit! Fuck.

              You okay?
              Yeah, yeah.

      I got a dead brick.
      Do you have a flashlight?

                  Yes.

Thank you.

            Okay.

              Hello?

              Hello?

        Is somebody here?

                Ow!

            Ow! Oh! Ow!

               Fuck, fuck, fuck!

                        Ah!

    Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

                      Oh, no.

            Oh, please, no.

            Oh!

Oh, shit, Samantha,
        fucking klutz.

                  Shit.

Goddamn it.

  Yeah, don't step on this.
  There's some advice.

<i> Guys,</i>  <i> I'm freaking out right now.
</i>  <i> Where are you?</i>

  <i> There is little kids up here.</i>
  <i> This little ghost ki...</i>

<i> No thank you, please.</i>

            Again, do it again.

<i> No, thank you, please.</i>

Whoa.

            It's a little girl.
  That's a little girl.

    It's clearly a little girl.
  That is a little girl.

  You heard it with your ears.
  You heard this
  with your ears?

  We heard this with our ears,
  believe me.

                  Give it to me.

<i> No, thank you, please.</i>
 God.

          "No, thank you..."
        "No, thank you, please."

            That's an EVP,
            a disembodied voice
            in this room.

  Yup.
        In the children's wing.

<i> No, thank you, please.</i>
 <i> No, thank you, please.</i>

        <i> No, thank you, please.</i>

          Did you listen to this
          all the way through?

    I think so.
          Come here, come here.
          Tell me what you hear.

<i>-  No, thank you, please.</i>

              There.
              Did you hear that?
      Play it again.

<i>-  No, thank you, please.</i>

"Go away."

<i> No, thank you, please.</i>

<i> Go away.</i>

           You hear that, right?
                Yeah.

          That's two...
          Two disembodied
          voices recorded.

      Jesus Christ.

                <i> GhostTrackers,</i>
                 100 episodes...
    I didn't hear that.

           Hillcrest Sanatorium.
            We have evidence
            of the paranormal.

          Tyler is going to
          shit in his pants.

  You didn't hear that,
  right, Cole?

No.

   Cole, listen, listen, listen.
  Did you hear, like, "Go away?"

       You didn't hear that part
        with your ears?
  No, I didn't.

        This is amazing.
        This is amazing.

      One more time.
      Listen again.

<i> No, thank you, please.</i>

<i> Go away.</i>
 "Go away."

Sometimes we
  like to use trigger objects
  to try to coax

  any spirits in the room
  to interact with us.

  In this case, Mark and Cole
  successfully recorded

  the disembodied voice
  of a little girl,

  so we're using candy canes
  as a trigger object.

  We've also lowered ourselves
  down to her level

  to make her feel
  more comfortable.

  You're recording?
                        Mmm-hmm.

Okay.

Hello?

Is there anybody here?

  Is there a little girl
  here with us?

  I know you're here,
  we heard you.

  We'd love to
  hear you again.

  We brought you some candy.

  Do you see this candy?
  You can have all
  the candy you want.

          You can touch it,
          you can take it.

  My name is Samantha.
  What's your name?

  Can you tell me
  your name?

Be quiet.

I told you.
                    I told you!

I told...
            I fucking told you.

Did you hear that?
  Did you hear that?

       Richard, are you in here?

          I'm here on the
        anniversary of the night
          you killed those kids.

       You want to do something?
        Do something to me.

               Come on, Richard.

                        Hello?

  Samantha to Tyler.
  Tyler, come in.

  Tyler, come in! Come on,
  you got to get up here.
  You're missing everything.

  <i> Tyler, what are you doing?</i>
  <i> Come on.</i>

  <i> Samantha to Tyler.</i>
  <i> Tyler, go. Tyler.</i>

  Sam, the Howl feed just
  went dead for some reason.

    It's working now.
    Tyler isn't in the room.

<i> I think you guys</i>
      <i> should go check on him</i>
      <i> and make sure he's okay.</i>

                Okay.

    Okay, copy, yeah.
    I'm going back.

    I'm going back.

          Tyler!

Ty!

Tyler!
              This stupid thing.

          All right,
          I left him right here.

Come on.

Tyler, baby,
          where'd you go?

Tyler?
What the fuck?

Come on, Tyler!

      if you see Tyler
      anywhere in the building?

            He's not in
            Richard Howl's room.

          None of them?
          Check again.

          Whoa!

What the fuck?
What?

Guys, check this out.

  What the fuck was that?

Wow.
  What the fuck was that?

        The fucking chair just
        flies across the room?

<i> The chair</i>
  <i> just moved.</i>

  <i> I was here a second ago,</i>
  <i> and it just moved.</i>

  <i> And the...</i>
  <i> The alarm went off.</i>

Come on,
  he set this shit up.
What is he doing?

Dude, if he's fucking
  with me right now,

  he's winning,
  I'll tell you that.

  <i> There's nobody here.</i>

  <i> This room is hot.</i>

  <i> And the temperature's</i>
  <i> going way up.</i>

  <i> This whole area</i>
  <i> is red hot.</i>

            Look, he's shaking.

Tyler!

Tyler!

What? Come on!
Tyler!

  Come on!

  Are you fucking
  with me right now?

Tyler!

Come on!

Tyler!
        Call the police.

Call the what?
  I said, "Call the police."

  How am I supposed to call?
  There's no fucking
  service here!

  How am I supposed
  to call the police?

              We'll go get...
              No, go get them.
              Go get the police.

  Come on! Is he fucking
  with me? Sam, is he fucking
  with me right now?

        Is he fucking with you?
  Yeah, is he fucking
  with me right now?

            Did you see what was
              on that video cam?

  Is he trying to get back
  at me for all the bullshit?
  It's such bullshit!

                Would you just
               shut up for once?
  What do you want?

  What are you talking about?
                  I don't know
                what I just saw.

Mark,
      shut the fuck up, man.

        I don't know what I just
          saw on that camera...
         What the fuck was that?

All right,
    we gotta get back.
    We gotta get...

      You go to a place outside.
    Come on. Come on. Come on.

Tyler!

What the fuck
  was that?
Tyler!

What the fuck was that there?
Tyler, it's me!
        Where are you?

  Don't fuck with me, Tyler!
  Don't...
                          Tyler!

Tyler?
Tyler!

Tyler.

  So Cole and I are walking
  around the perimeter,

  just scouting things out,

  and then we discover
  our boy Irwin over here.

  I thought he was
  taking a piss.

  He's just
  talking to no one.

            Absolutely no one.

            Or, maybe he's
            talking to a demon.

    Dude, seriously,
    this guy's out of his mind.

                He's crazy, man.
                What's he doing?

What's he doing?
            No, no, no, no, no.
