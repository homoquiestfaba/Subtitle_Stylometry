Now I lay me down to sleep.

<i>Now I lay me down to sleep.</i>

I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
<i>Now I lay me down to sleep.</i>

<i>If I should die before I wake.
If I should die before I wake.</i>

Now I lay me down to sleep. <i>I
pray the Lord my soul to keep.</i>

I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
<i>If I should die before I wake.</i>

If I should die before I wake. <i>I
pray the Lord my soul to take.</i>

If I should die before I wake. <i>I
pray the Lord my soul to take.</i>

I pray the Lord my soul to take.

Bet I'll beat you there. Oh, yeah?
Bet you won't.

My mother says that's where
the weird kids live.

<i>They're not weird. They're
just foster children.</i>

It's the scariest house I've ever seen.
I'm not afraid of it.

I guess you're not so tough <i>now.</i>

I guess you're not so tough <i>now.</i>

Wait. What are you doing?

Are you crazy?
You can't go in there!

Watch me.

<i>Come back!
Come back!</i>

Hello?

Are you o--

Oh!

Be strong.

Are we gonna play games today,
Claire, or have a real discussion?

A real discussion. Good.

And don't even try to claim
you're taking your prescriptions,

'cause I can tell you're not.

I don't wanna go through my whole
life feeling like a zombie.

I don't wanna go through my whole
life feeling like a zombie.

I understand that.
No, you don't understand,

'cause you don't
have to take all that shit.

Well, is the alternative better?

Night terrors,
the panic attacks,

the serious episodes of
depression-- You know what?

The only thing
that I wanna do is act,

and I can't do that if I'm
cut off from my emotions.

If I can't do the only thing that makes
me happy, I might as well be dead.

I agree with you that the meds
are a Band-Aid solution.

Have you given any thought
to my suggestion?

Have you visited
the Darrode house?

I've tried to...
a whole bunch of times.

Really?
Yep.

I-- I stand out front...

and I can't breathe
and my whole body shakes.

I've tried to make it through
the gate, but I just can't.

I've tried to make it through
the gate, but I just can't.

I can't get past it.

What happened to you
in that house was so terrible,

your mind just locked it
in a steel vault.

Should I really
want to open it up?

Until you unlock those events
and face your past,

your disorders
will never dissipate.

We've tried
everything else, Claire--

Hypnosis, regression therapy--

You know what? I'm scared, okay?

I'm too fucking scared.

I'm too fucking scared.

Find a way.

Take an army in there
with you if you have to.

Only by returning to the scene of
the traumas can you overcome them.

Even if going there
is traumatic?

You can never know who you are
until you can remember...

what took place
at the Darrode house.

But once those repressed
memories come back,

you will finally be free.

What is
the essence of performance?

Acting is the art of communicating
with the audience...

through the use of truthful
and authentic behavior.

Authenticity is a muscle.
<i>You have to exercise it.</i>

So, before today's scenes--

This punishment
is both cruel and unusual.

I want my lawyer.

Well, let's play
a little challenge and response.

Well, let's play
a little challenge and response.

Bruce, since you just volunteered,
get up here. Uh, you too, Eldon.

Me first? Yeah.

Okay. Why are you
such a smart-ass punk?

I'm a comedian.
It's good practice.

Why are you
such an uptight prick?

I'm not uptight.
I'm serious-minded.

Did you get your butt kicked a lot in high school?
I still do.

You don't like me very much, do you?
No, I like you. I like you.

You're cool. See, I just
like to mess with you.

Good honesty.
Uh, Rudy, replace Bruce.

What kind of black guy
plays chess and watches PBS?

The thoughtful
and intelligent kind?

Right. Why do you feel the
need to stereotype me?

I just think it's nuts that I'm more
into basketball and rap than you.

Are you overcompensating because
you grew up in a "white" area?

Are you overcompensating because
you grew up in a "white" area?

I've never thought about it.
Are you overcompensating...

because you play sports
with "the brothers"?

Possibly. I mean, don't you think it's
time you started dating sisters for once?

They don't like me.

Isn't the only reason
why you're acting...

because you tore up your fucking knee
and can't play football anymore?

Damn right. You think you're actually
gonna be the next Denzel or Will Smith?

Why are you comin' down
so hard on me, man?

I'm just playing a game.
You know I got love for you.

<i>All right. Ariel, uh,
come up for Eldon.</i>

<i>All right. Ariel, uh,
come up for Eldon.</i>

Okay.

So-- Who's the hottest-looking
babe in this class?

You are.

Why do you need me
to validate it?

Because you're cute and...
I like to hear you say it.

But why are you always
chasing after Claire...

when she's obviously...
not good enough for you?

When she's obviously...
not good enough for you?

I'm not "always"
chasing after Claire.

Rudy, you're now
a convicted liar.

Shut up.
<i>Claire, come up and replace Rudy.</i>

Why are you such a sketchy bitch?
Takes one to know one, honey.

Why don't you just go ahead and tell Rudy you're
a lesbian freak and you're just not into guys?

Because I'm not one.
The question is,

which plastic surgeon is gonna fix
your face after I tear it off?

Okay, Claire. Sit down.

Okay, Claire. Sit down.

Uh, Lily? Bye, Claire.

Did you know that blondes tend
to lose their looks by age 35?

Oh. Well, it's a really good thing you
don't have to worry about losing yours.

What are you anyways-- a vampire
or a refugee from Salem?

I'm just a demure, girl-next-door,
take-home-to-Mommy type.

But I do have enough brains...

to know that this entire exercise
is a total bullshit waste of time.

<i>Agreed.</i>

<i>Agreed.</i>

Just being authentic.
Can we get to our scenes now?

Is this
the advanced acting class?

Yes, and class is in session.

Excellent. Excellent.
How can I help you?

Only a moment of your time,
if you please. Only a moment.

Thank you. Thank you.
Hi. My name is Walston Ray,

and I am the king
of horror haunts.

And I'd like to speak
to your students--

And I'd like to speak
to your students--

Only for a moment, if
you don't mind-- But--

To offer them a rare opportunity
to ply their trade...

and practice
their craft of acting.

And make a little money
while you're doing it.

You know, I'm sort of
a teacher myself, in a way.

They call me
the Professor... of Fear!

Do they give out
degrees in that?

I have created 36...

of the most successful horror
attractions in this country.

Of the most successful horror
attractions in this country.

Ghost Castle. Spookville.

The Ghastly Pit. Terrordome.

Hey, I've been to Spookville.
It's in Florida, right?

Yes. One of my more profitable
enterprises, thank you.

But... I am about to open...

my greatest masterpiece.

My crew has been slaving
around the clock...

to transform the scene
of an infamous local crime...

into a haunted house
for the ages!

Into a haunted house
for the ages!

I am turning
the Darrode foster home into...

Dark House!

What?
I've heard of the place.

The, uh-- the lady who ran it
killed, like, 20 kids, right?

Dude, I heard it was 40, and then
they shut that place down for good.

Seriously? Well--

Hey, Claire. You're from here.
What do you know about it?

Nothing. I've never heard of it.

So why am I here?

I have two reporters
from national publications...

I have two reporters
from national publications...

coming tomorrow night
to review the show.

And I need actors,
and I need them now,

which is why I'm willing to offer
each and every one of you...

$300 for a day's work,

and if you're good, you'll be
signed on for the whole season.

Do the math.

How many people are working there?
Ten, including you,

if you all agree to join me for tomorrow
night-- more for the real show.

Well, thespians?

Well, thespians?

<i>I don't know. I'm--
I'm a serious actor.</i>

I'm not really interested in doing
some corny show. No offense.

Ah.
I really don't want to get fake blood in my hair, so--

Yeah. Hollywood's
gonna typecast me as it is.

Are you guys crazy? You'd pass on
a chance to do a horror movie?

Half of the best actors got
their start in horror movies.

Yeah, but this
isn't a movie.Exactly.

You guys are always bitching about
Caldecote's stupid exercises.

I beg your pardon? Now we get a chance to
actually perform in front of the public,

I beg your pardon? Now we get a chance to
actually perform in front of the public,

and you're gonna be snobs?

Acting is acting. Actors act.

<i>You know what? If-- If Claire's
with it, it's good enough for me.</i>

I'm in.
All right. Me too.

I guess I could use the money.

Come on, man.

All right. Whatever. Whatever.
I'd better not regret it.

All right. Whatever. Whatever.
I'd better not regret it.

Excellent! Bravo, all of you!

<i>Well, I will see you tomorrow
morning at Dark House at 9:00 a.m.</i>

Don't be late.

I thank you, sir, for your time.

Players! Play on!

I'm standing in front of
the Darrode foster group home,

where yesterday, seven children
were brutally murdered...

by 50-year-old
Janet Cooper Darrode,

who then took her own life
in gruesome fashion.

No motive has been found
for the killings.

The identities of all the
children have been withheld.

From Bridge Haven,
I'm Karen Blake, Cable 8 News.

It's just as creepy
as they said.

Yeah. Victorian architecture
does that every time.

Let's go.

So, Lily. I heard you're a dominatrix.
Is that true?

Fuck off, Bruce. Oh, please.
Hurt me more!

<i>How about I just kill you?</i>

You guys the actors?
Uh-huh.

Come on in.

Okay.

Okay.

I'll be right back. Don't-- Yeah.
You do that. Yeah.

Claire, you okay? Yeah.

What are you waiting for?
This is your idea.

Let's go.

Oh, my goodness.
Is that 16th century Etruscan?

Man, it's cold.

Welcome to my latest nightmare,
my thespian friends.

Allow me to introduce you to my
brilliant artistic director, Samantha.

Hello-- Ooh. What's your name?

Ariel.

And my head usher,
the maleficent Moreton.

You dudes ready to scare
the fuck out of some people?

Yeah, <i>dude.
We can't fuckin' wait.</i>

Is it always this cold in here?

No, you're right.
That's strange. It's freezing.

Maybe somebody left a window open.
No. That's not possible.

All of the windows are sealed shut
in this house, except for the attic.

We maintain a completely
controlled environment, so--

That way no one here
gets out alive! Rock on!

Well, we'll check
the thermostat...

or perhaps
you could wear more clothes.

Or not.

Or not.

Ooh. There's time for you to explore the
house later, but we have work to do.

Come on.

All right, people. Let's go.
Your time is my money.

Uh, yeah. About that-- Speaking of
which, can we get paid in cash?

Absolutely. After the show.

No problemo, dude.

Looks like you got yourself
a new admirer.

Story of my life.
Man-eater, dyke bait.

Story of my life.
Man-eater, dyke bait.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I present...

the Corridor of Blood.

<i>Excuse me, sir. I thought you said this
was supposed to be your masterpiece.</i>

<i>Excuse me, sir. I thought you said this
was supposed to be your masterpiece.</i>

I-I mean, with all due respect,

<i>Spookville seemed like it had a
lot more going on than this.</i>

Sorry.

You're probably right, but...

sometimes looks
can be deceiving.

<i>I would like the bravest
member of your little group...</i>

to stand right here.

Mm-hmm. Okay.

<i>Ah. Okay. What you got for me?</i>

Say hello to my friend...

Evil Clown.

Hey. Hey, why don't you
get a job at Jack in the Box?

You're not gonna scare me
with some rubber ax!

Oh. Mofo the Clown
ain't playin' around, man.

Well, neither am I,
so bring it on, Bozo!

<i>Gone up against linebackers
way tougher than you!</i>

Oh, dude. You just got punked!

Oh, my God. Rudy. Are you okay?

Fine.

That was amazing. That was amazing.
What the hell was it?

It was the world's most advanced
holographic illusion system.

<i>I thought that holographs were clear like ghosts.
Yeah.</i>

Not any more.

My technicians
have spent the last month...

installing over 2,000 laser image
projectors all over this building.

We can project anything anywhere
inside the walls of Dark House...

We can project anything anywhere
inside the walls of Dark House...

and make it look
absolutely real.

But wait. There's more. Oh?

Infrared sensors are set to
trigger the holographs...

any time they sense
extreme excitement or--

Fear. Fear.

Oh! Or if not, we can use this
handy little remote control.

We have a library
of over 100 creepy characters.

<i>Designed by yours truly.</i>

No applause necessary.

No applause necessary.

Check this out.

Oh, yeah.
Sweet. Brain eaters.

Cool!
That is bad-ass.

Yeah. Different fiends
come at you every time.

It's fuckin' great
for repeat business.

Now, you actors
will be our hosts...

and play characters that
interact with the holographs.

Moreton will show you
everything you need to know.

Moreton will show you
everything you need to know.

<i>Can we check out your mainframe?</i>

I mean, you guys must be processing
at least 300 teraflops a second...

to produce
such dynamic 3-D algorithms.

You are correct.
Would you like to see it?

Please. Uh, how the hell
did you know all that?

I read <i>Wired.
Follow me.</i>

Uh, not often, just--

Harris, we're not alone.

Harris, we're not alone.

â™ª

<i>Oh. You're not
feeling well, are you?</i>

Why don't you just go ahead and go home,
and I'll take care of Rudy for you.

Oh, my goodness, ladies and gentlemen.
The IBM Blue Gene.

This sucker's a multi-cluster,
hyper-threading,

symmetric multi-processing
monster, ladies and gentlemen.

This is a piece of work.

You are the biggest fucking nerd sometimes.
It's embarrassing, man.

You are the biggest fucking nerd sometimes.
It's embarrassing, man.

Thank you for saying that
so I didn't have to.

<i>Both of you promote the idiot male
stereotype every time you open your mouth.</i>

Oh, you're sweet.
Preach.

Is there a reason you're bringing
tourists down here, Walston?

I didn't want to deprive our new actors of
your scintillating personality, Harris.

This is Harris, our
unquestionably brilliant,

visionary creator of the
holographic illusion system.

You!

You!

You get out!

Do you mind?
Oh.

The only thing Harris dislikes more
than his fellow human beings...

is the fact that he has to come to an evil
capitalist like me in order to fund his research.

Isn't that true, Harris?
I don't dislike everyone, Walston.

Mainly just you.

All right. Moving on. Let us, uh, go
back upstairs to get our scripts,

All right. Moving on. Let us, uh, go
back upstairs to get our scripts,

change into our costumes
and rehearse!

Reporters will be here before we
know it, so time is of the essence.

Let's go, go, go!

Awesome. Awesome. Thank you very much.
We have to move.

Ow! Ow!

Leave him alone!

What the fuck
are you looking at?

Knew they were gonna cast me
as the fucking witch.

So goddamn predictable, I swear.

Oh, and guess who gets to play
the damsel in distress.

Yep, Miss Blonde
Waste of Space, Ariel.

I don't know why you let that
bitch talk so much shit to you.

What's the mirror
covered up for?

I... just didn't feel like
looking at myself.

Oh.

Oh.

Have you read this cheesy-ass
shit that we have to say?

Moreton the gore geek thinks
it's better than Shakespeare.

Well, at least-- at least you're a cool
character. They made me a fear guide.

So, Rudy's been grilling me
about how you feel about him.

How am I supposed to know?

So what's the deal
with that, anyway?

I mean, obviously
the guy's nuts about you...

and I love that, because
it makes Ariel miserable.

And I love that, because
it makes Ariel miserable.

I don't know. I really... have too much to
deal with to worry about guys right now.

You know why you're the only
one in class I can trust? Why?

Because you're even more
fucked up than I am.

Thanks.

We've both been members of
the self-slicers of America.

I never noticed.
I wear long pants.

I never noticed.
I wear long pants.

Hey, have you ever tried Welbutrin?
I highly recommend it.

I've tried Paxil, but you just absolutely
cannot come with that stuff in you,

and then you just
get depressed all over again.

I'll try and remember that.
All right.

Well, I'm gonna
go to the bathroom,

because I need a mirror
to put this together.

I-- I tripped.

People ask me... "Why fear?"

But to me, that's like asking,
"Why food and water?

The stimulation of terror,

the quickening of the blood,

the rapid breath
of anticipation,

<i>the activation of
the fight-or-flight response...</i>

<i>are all part of our sustenance.</i>

Human beings seek danger and
the resulting fear because...

it's what makes us truly alive.

It's what makes us truly alive.

Oh, God! Preach it, Walston! Oh!

Feel the fear.

So often,
the glorious rush of fear...

can only be obtained
by risking life and limb.

<i>But throughout human history,</i>

we few-- we happy few,
we entertainers--

<i>We have been charged with providing
the release of that fear...</i>

in a safe and harmless way.

We are the merchants of
adrenaline in a civilized world.

We are the merchants of
adrenaline in a civilized world.

Through us, people can face
their worst fears...

and live to tell the tale.

Through us, they can die
a thousand deaths...

and... truly live.

This guy loves his work.

Impress those reporters tonight.

Be proud
you're in a horror show.

Know your lines well.
Perform them with passion.

Know your lines well.
Perform them with passion.

And above all, always--
Always-- leave them screaming!

What the hell?

What the--

Who the hell
put you in my system?

I'm gonna have to reboot
the whole damn system.

Damn it!

Harris.

<i>Harris. The hell?</i>

What's that?

Harris.

<i>I've reviewed over 200 Halloween haunts
for Fright Night magazine, Walston.</i>

You used to have the top five
attractions in the country,

but people think
you're falling off now.

The effects over at Graveside
in Seattle absolutely rule.

<i>So? Is this the place that's
gonna put you back on top?</i>

I have never left the top.

I have never left the top.

But once you've experienced
Dark House,

your readers will know that I have
raised the bar to the stratosphere.

Well, we'll see about that.

My readers at <i>U.S.A. News will be more concerned
about your exploitation of a tragedy.</i>

I'm not sure that the use of the
word "exploitation" is quite fair.

And when you say "my readers" are
concerned, Paula, don't you mean you?

Seven children were brutally
killed in this house.

That's common knowledge.
Well, it is,

now that you've plastered the details
of the massacre all over the Internet.

I haven't used
the names of the victims.

I haven't used
the names of the victims.

But you're taking advantage of the murder of
children to sell tickets to a horror attraction.

You don't see
anything wrong with that?

<i>Not any more than you writing about
it in order to sell magazines.</i>

<i>It's merely background.</i>

The tragic events
that occurred in this house...

are not mentioned,
they're not referred to,

they're not depicted
in any way in my show.

I don't know why not.
Ghostly kids are pretty freaky.

<i>Paula, all I ask is that
you keep an open mind,</i>

<i>and whatever moral
judgments you may have,</i>

just report accurately
whether my show is scary or not.

Just report accurately
whether my show is scary or not.

That's fair, isn't it?

Okay. Let's see what you've got here.
Splendid.

Here we go.

Dark House is under way.
Mmm-hmm.

And now,
let the frightmare begin.

And now,
let the frightmare begin.

Allow me to introduce
your host this evening:

The Shroud!

Welcome to Dark House,

the most evil house
on the East Coast.

<i>In just a moment, you'll
witness horrors so freakish,</i>

terrors so mind-bending...

that I can't promise
you'll leave with your sanity...

or your life.

Welcome to Dark House.

It's time to face your fears.

It's time to face your fears.

Yes! Now that is bad-ass!

Have these bats
been checked for rabies?

Ascend. Come on. Let's go.

Hey. I like to improvise a lot, so
just roll with the punches. Thanks.

<i>What in the hell?</i>

Down the Corridor of Blood
lurk the Six Rooms of Doom.

But to get there, you must first get
past the beings that guard the hallways.

Oh.

Oh.

Yeah. Wow. Stand back. We must
repel this underworld spawn.

Begone, foul wraith!
Back to hell!

Oh, shit!

Oh, shit!

Fuck!

Wow! Nailed him!

It's so real. Yeah.

All right. Let's get going before
the wraith comes back for us.

Yeah. I'm with that. Please
lead the-- Go. Uh, yeah.

<i>Way to bleed out, dude.
You're disgusting.</i>

<i>Way to bleed out, dude.
You're disgusting.</i>

Moreton, you asshole.

My name... is Thaddeus Payne,

and I'm a mortician...

and I'm a mortician...

who specializes in
the internment of the damned.

Please step forward and see the body of
a sadistic killer of 93 innocent women.

What's different about
preparing the damned for burial?

The body must be sealed,

with every orifice
tightly sewn shut.

And if the body's not sealed?

The damned soul will escape.

Wanna see?

Uh, yeah. Yeah. Totally.

Be released.

God! Get away from me!

It's like they can see us!

Let's get out of here
while we still can.

What in the hell
is going on up there?

Do you realize how much money
I have sunk into this place?

Well, why don't you just relax?

I mean, it's out of our
control right now. What?

Asking me to relax is like
asking you to sleep with a man!

It's against my nature.

It's against my nature.

Please. Please help me.

<i>Help me!
Dad's gonna kill me! Help!</i>

Be afraid. Run for your lives.

Be very afraid. <i>Get out.</i>

Help me. Please help me.
Help me.

<i>Please help me.</i>

He's gonna
cut me up next. Please help.

Please help!

Daddy, I love you.
There's no escape.

Daddy, I love you.
There's no escape.

Get out. Get out while you can.

<i>Run!</i>

Please help me! He's gonna
cut me up next! Please!

The prisoners who are kept here are
of a very dangerous type-- vampires.

Heed the warning.

You know, when a sign says "Do
not cross," we got to cross it.

Come on. No. No!

Come on. No. No!

Do not do that again!

Would you relax?

That was-- You almost got me that time.
That was awesome. Wow.

Okay. Let's move on. Yeah.

No!

No!

No! No! Ohh!

<i>Leave me alone! Leave me alone!</i>

Oh, now we're talking. Some
mark of the devil action. Yeah!

This is terrible.
<i>These criminals don't deserve your sympathy.</i>

I'm innocent!
<i>The choice is yours, sir.</i>

Thumbs up or thumbs down?
<i>Please. Don't do it.</i>

Thumbs up or thumbs down?
<i>Please. Don't do it.</i>

<i>I'm innocent. Innocent.</i>

Yeah. <i>No!</i>

A wise decision.
No, don't do it.

Don't!

I've brought two more
sacrifices for you, Zimba.

Come, my children, to the center of
the star. The Sabbath is at hand.

Come, come.

Come, come.

You.

Your fate is clear to me,
my dear.

I see you married to a corpse...

and living in a grave.

But wait. Do you hear that?

The coven arrives.

You're doomed.

Sometimes to find a cure,
sacrifices must be made.

In this room, a dedicated
scientist searches...

for new ways
to end human suffering.

A quest--

Which, at times,
requires human suffering.

I've invented a new fluid that will make
scalpels unnecessary during surgery.

Allow me to demonstrate.

Observe the results.

<i>Oh, wow.</i>

<i>I know this is a hologram,
but this looks so real.</i>

Oh, cut the shit, Reed.
This isn't a trick!

Go get help! Go! Go get help!
Hurry! Hurry! Go! Go!

Oh, God!

Oh, my God!

Miss Cummings.

Help! Somebody, help!

Help! Claire?

Help! Somebody!

<i>- Fuck!
That's just makeup, isn't it? Tell me that's just makeup.</i>

<i>- Fuck!
That's just makeup, isn't it? Tell me that's just makeup.</i>

Oh, my God.
<i>Oh, Jesus. What happened?</i>

The mad scientist threw acid in his face!
He threw acid!

That's impossible. The mad
scientist is-- It's a hologram.

Yeah. So is the acid.
They're just illusions.

You look at his face and you tell
me that is an illusion! He is dead!

Please! Please!

Shit! Help me!

You got to help me! Please!

Okay, she's dead.

Okay, she's dead.

A reporter for a national magazine is dead.
This is terrible.

Yeah, no kidding. Publicity
is going to be disastrous.

What-- Not to mention that
she's a human being, Walston.

Aah! Shit! Shit!
<i>Thumbs up! Thumbs up!</i>

Thumbs up! Thumbs up! Thumbs up!
Thumbs up! No! No! No!

Thumbs up! Thumbs up!
Thumbs up! Thumbs up!

<i>No! Thumbs up! I'm gonna go find
out what's going on up there.</i>

What?
Okay, okay, okay. Get over there,

and you're gonna help me
put her on the couch.

And you're gonna help me
put her on the couch.

Yeah, we wouldn't want the press
to find her lying on the ground.

Oh, shut up.

Come on. Ready?

Thumbs up! Thumbs up! Stop!

What are you guys doing?
Who's the idiot in the kilt?

That idiot can really hurt Bruce.
Please.

Stop! Thumbs up! Thumbs up!

<i>Don't let him close it!
All right, all right! Enough!</i>

Bruce, you're scaring everybody.

You got to help me! Please!

<i>Please!</i>

<i>Please!</i>

No!
<i>Stop!</i>

Go get him out.

Fuck. He's dead.
How could this happen?

I can't believe it.
Oh, fuck.

It's her! It's Miss Darrode!

Oh, man. That was--

Damn.

Damn.

There might be a way for us to spin
this to our benefit. Listen to this.

"Famous reporter scared to death
in haunted attraction."

That could work. That could pack 'em in.
What do you think?

Wow.

Claire! Claire!

She's having a panic attack.
Shh, shh, shh.

Claire. Claire. Claire.
Shh. Breathe, okay? Breathe.

Breathe. We need you to be
here with us, okay? Breathe.

Breathe. We need you to be
here with us, okay? Breathe.

Listen, I don't know what the hell is going
on, but we got to get off of this floor!

Look, he's right. We got to go.
Come on. Come on!

Whoa!

What is this?

What the hell
are you people doing?

What the hell are you doing? One of
your holograms has killed two people!

Hey! Are you insane? No, seriously, dude.
We just all saw it happen.

That fucking thing just closed on Bruce!
It didn't even give him a goddamn chance!

That fucking thing just closed on Bruce!
It didn't even give him a goddamn chance!

A chance to get
ventilated is all!

What the hell happened to her?

<i>She fell down the stairs, broke her neck.
It was an accident.</i>

No, it wasn't. One of your
holograms must have pushed her.

What? <i>Okay, look. Listen. Okay?</i>

Holograms are illusions created by laser
light. Okay, that's all they are.

Okay, a bad accident
has happened here,

which has made everyone naturally a
little upset <i>and a little confused.</i>

I'm not getting a signal.
<i>I'm off-network. - Me too.</i>

Shit!
Walston, call the police on the landline.

I already tried that. The lines are down. We
have some sort of strange interference going--

I already tried that. The lines are down. We
have some sort of strange interference going--

Fucking interference! We're
staying alive, is that clear?

Let's all discuss this calmly.
I'm getting the fuck out of here, man.

Wait, wait, wait.
You are a psycho!

Walston, unlock this fucking
door before I break it down!

Well, it shouldn't be locked.
It opens from the inside. <i>- Fuck!</i>

Oh, fuck!
Eldon, watch out! Turn around!

<i>Turn it off!</i>

<i>Eldon!
Move!</i>

<i>Eldon!
Move!</i>

I got to get you out of here.
Turn it off!

<i>Stop! Wait! Rudy.</i>

God, why won't it open?

Fuck! Shit! Come on!

<i>Something's wrong.
Oh, my God! Don't!</i>

Rudy, listen to me.
It's not the holographs.

Rudy, listen to me.
It's not the holographs.

It's the woman who killed all those
kids-- the spirit of Miss Darrode.

What is going on?
I have no idea.

Can't somebody turn
this fucking thing off!

<i>Make it stop!</i>

Hah!
Get him, Eldon!

All right, ugly.
I'm done fuckin' running!

I saw her. Right before Bruce and
Reed were killed, I saw her.

Claire, no!
<i>Come on, fucker!</i>

Eldon! Shit! Come on!

Let's do this!
Eldon!

That's impossible. We got to get
out of this fucking crazy place.

How the fuck do we get out
of here, Walston?

The doors are locked!
The windows are bricked up!

Everybody, shut up! There's
nothing we can do about it now.

Come with me if you want to live.
Come on.

Come with me if you want to live.
Come on.

Samantha, now where the hell are you going?
Fuck you, Walston!

What the fuck are we gonna do now?
Let's get the fuck out of here.

Come, come, come.
Where are we going?

Come, come, come.
Where are we going?

There's an unlocked window in this
bathroom. I think we can get out this way.

Well, what about the others?

One of the others is some kind of maniac.
I don't know what happened back there,

but holograms do not kill.

What is fucking happening? I don't know.
Just help me with this window.

How do you know
I'm not the maniac?

Because you're too cute.

So if you get me out of here alive,
does that mean I have to do you?

Yes. Okay.

Okay.

It's not gonna open!

Yeah, no kidding. I told you.
It's a security door!

You're gonna need a battering
ram to take it down.

<i>It's her. She won't let us out.</i>

Who? Miss Darrode.

She's haunting this house.

<i>No. No. That is such
superstitious drivel!</i>

<i>No. No. That is such
superstitious drivel!</i>

There's someone responsible for this,
and I know who it is-- Harris.

Why Harris?

Because that bastard
has somehow figured out...

how to make his holographs
solid-- I know it!

And he's always hated me,
so he's trying to kill me...

so that he can steal
our research!

How is that even possible? I mean,
aren't holographs made of nothing?

Huh? Dense photons. Coherent light waves.
How the hell do I know?

Huh? Dense photons. Coherent light waves.
How the hell do I know?

He's the genius. Take that.

Harris, you open this door!

I know what you're trying to do, you
miscreant, maladjusted, misfit motherfucker!

Why won't anyone listen to me? It
is the spirit of Miss Darrode.

I-I don't know who sounds
crazier, Walston or you.

Okay, who goes first?
Okay. Be my guest, baby.

Oh, my God! Are you okay?
You okay?

Oh, you poor baby. What?

Oh, you poor baby. What?

Oh, my God.

Open up! Please!

It's a security door.

Walston, you need a battering
ram to open it. Oh, shut up.

Walston, you need a battering
ram to open it. Oh, shut up.

Look, isn't there a way to shut
down the holograph system? Yes.

The fuse box,
which is in the basement!

Wa-Wa-Wa-Wait a minute.

We installed a backup fuse box
to handle power overloads.

Where is it? Second floor.

Let's go.
How did I know you were gonna say that?

Did you really think we're being
attacked by a woman's spirit?

Yes! And I think it's because of me.
I'm sorry.

<i>Why? What would the ghost of
some murderer have against you?</i>

I lied when I said I hadn't
heard of this place before.

I lied when I said I hadn't
heard of this place before.

I was here 14 years ago,
the day of the massacre.

What?

I was here.
I was seven years old.

But I can't remember anything.
Just images and flashes.

I can't remember
what happened to me!

And my psychiatrist said that if I came
back here, my memories would return.

So that's why you talked us
all into taking this job?

I was scared. I was scared.

I was scared. I was scared.

And I thought that with everybody
working here, I'd be able to handle it.

You fucking bitch.

I trusted you.

You-- You fucking
got people killed...

<i>being pawns in
your fucking therapy?</i>

You fucking bitch!

Calm down, Lily!

Look, how could Claire know this was
gonna happen? How could anyone know?

Look, this is all so ridiculous!

Harris is behind this,
all right?

Harris is behind this,
all right?

Now, if you're done with the soap opera
interlude, get on with this! Come on!

He's right. All right, we don't
have time to fight, you know,

whether it's with Harris
or some spirit.

They're using the system to kill us.
We gotta shut it down.

Okay, so there's a gray metal panel
behind that painting on the far wall.

Past all the rooms--
Awesome.

So one of us has to got to go down there
and unscrew the panel with this...

and disconnect the red wires.

So, volunteers?
I'll do it.

No. Excellent idea.

This is up to me.
All right, look.

Red wires, you got that?
All right.

Red wires, you got that?
All right.

Whatever you do, remain calm.

Holographs are triggered by fear.
Calm. Red wires. Good man.

Be careful, Rudy.

Ohh. No, no, no, no.
Remain calm.

<i>All right, all right.
Good, good, good.</i>

You can do it.

Hurry! Good man.

Shit. - Come on!
You're almost there.

Shit. - Come on!
You're almost there.

Oh, my God!
Oh, fuck! He's coming after you! Rudy, look--

Hurry!
No! Don't turn around! Just keep doing it!

Oh, my God! Hurry! Hurry, Rudy!
<i>- Rudy!</i>

Rudy! - Hurry!
<i>- Rudy, look out!</i>

Rudy! Oh, my God!

<i>The last one! Rudy!</i>

Hurry, Rudy!
Oh, God! Rudy! Hurry!

<i>He's coming! Don't look!</i>

Hurry! Hurry! Go! Go! Look out!

Hurry! Hurry! Go! Go! Look out!

I got it!

Hurry! Oh, my God!

<i>Go!</i>

Oh, my God! Rudy! Oh, my God!

Oh, my God.

Go and help Rudy.

He's dead, Claire.
All right, he's dead.

He's dead, Claire.
All right, he's dead.

It's a good thing
we're all smokers.

Hey, wait a minute.
What is this?

Oh, I don't believe it.

These are the basement
door keys in my pocket.

What now, Walston?
What do you mean, "what now?"

I'm going back to the
basement to get Harris.

And we can probably unlock
the doors from there.

<i>- Come on.
Wait a minute.</i>

Didn't you say there was
an open window in the attic?

Yes.
Well, how do you get there?

There's an access door inside that
storage closet right there. Why?

There's an access door inside that
storage closet right there. Why?

That's where I'm going.
You can do what you want.

You go ahead. I don't care.
I know where I'm going.

Claire, are you with me
or with her?

<i>I'd go with him, Claire.</i>

You're not safe alone with me.

Let's go.
Fine.

<i>Hey, Claire? Yeah?</i>

You got your closure now?

Fuck.

Okay.

Oh, shit! Shit!

You know, there's an emergency generator
in the garage. That fucker, Harris.

It's not Harris! Let's go.

War is hell.

Jesus! Ah, here we go.

Jesus! Ah, here we go.

Oh, damn it! Damn it!

No!

No! Claire!

Claire!

No! No!

No! No! Aah!

No!

Walston.

Oh, my God.

<i>Don't let him close it! Please!</i>

<i>Don't let him close it! Please!</i>

Stop it! Somebody's coming!

<i>Let me out of here!</i>

<i>"And some trumpet players." Ow.</i>

"And I saw an angel
come down from heaven,

"And I saw an angel
come down from heaven,

"holding the key
to the bottomless pit...

and a great chain
in his hands." Ow!

Ow! Ohh!
Hear the words of God...

and leave this child,
foul demon Azazel.

"...the dragon,
that old s-serpent,

"which is the devil and Satan,

and bound him a thousand years."

And I do unbind you from
this child, demon Lamia.

And I do unbind you from
this child, demon Lamia.

"He cast him into
this bottomless pit.

He shut him up and set a seal upon
him, as to deceive nations no more."

I exorcise you into the
bottomless pit, demon Mammon,

subverter of the pure
and innocent.

Be gone, hellions!

Now it's just the two of us,

you most evil of all demons.

I've come for you,
cursed Juvaar.

If you came for me, why did
you kill all the others?

If you came for me, why did
you kill all the others?

The deaths of those sinners--

Brought me back to the flesh.

Why are you still here?

<i>I was damned...</i>

because I let you get away.

But I'll soon be free!

Because now I'm sending you
back where you belong,

Because now I'm sending you
back where you belong,

demon!

Why do you think I'm a demon?
What did I do?

Oh.

You'll have plenty of time
to remember it all...

while you rot in hell!

No!

No more!

What's wrong?
What are you doing?

No more.

No!

You fucking demons!

You stay right where you are!

Help! Help!

Die! Die!

<i>The house of the-- No!</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>Die, you demons!</i>

<i>You filthy demons,
may you rot in hell!</i>

<i>No! No! Please!</i>

<i>Die!</i>

<i>- No! No!
Die! Die!</i>

Claire?

I know you're here somewhere.

<i>Claire?</i>

You're possessed
by the demon named Juvaar.

I need to save your soul.

Claire, do you hear me? Claire?

<i>Claire?</i>

It's all your fault!

It's all your fault!

Claire!

Why did you make this happen?

Oh, God!

I--

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Oh, God, forgive me, please.
Oh, God, please.

Oh, God, forgive me, please.
Oh, God, please.

Oh, God!

What did I do?

What have I done?

It wasn't my fault.

<i>I was a child.</i>

We were all children
who didn't know any better.

We were never the sinners!
You were.

You took a religion that was about
love and you made us hate it!

I have been running from you
my whole life!

I am through running!

Miss Darrode,
you go to hell, bitch!

Go to hell, bitch.

Miss Darrode, go to hell!

Go to hell, bitch.

Go to hell, bitch.

Go! Go!

Go to hell, bitch.

Bitch, go to hell.

Go to hell.

Go to hell.

Go to hell. Hey, Detective, in here!
We found one alive!

Go to hell, bitch.

Go to hell, bitch.

Go to hell.

Kill. Kill.

Kill.

Kill.

Kill. Kill.

<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

Need some help analyzing
all this evidence?

No. I got it all figured out.

I'll write up my report
and we can close the case.

All right, Sherlock,

<i>dazzle me, won't you?</i>

Janet Darrode inherited
this old house 17 years ago.

Janet Darrode inherited
this old house 17 years ago.

She started bringing in income
by taking in foster children.

She goes cuckoo one day
and kills seven of 'em.

Darrode House massacre.

So here's where
it gets real interesting.

Only one kid lives--

A little girl by the name
of Claire.

Bingo. Claire's identity
is kept secret.

She's adopted by a local couple.

But the girl's traumatized.

She develops more bugs
than Windows Vista.

I mean, a cutter, suicide
tries, psych meds up the wazoo.

I mean, a cutter, suicide
tries, psych meds up the wazoo.

Her idiot shrink tells her to go
back to recover her memories.

<i>Claire takes this haunted house gig, but
it's way too much for her mind to handle.</i>

Plus, she's off her meds.
A lethal combination.

Claire goes psycho.

She takes out the guy
controlling the holographs...

and sets the computer
on overdrive.

She puts glue
into the door locks.

Now these holographs start to run crazy.
Confusion erupts all over.

Now these holographs start to run crazy.
Confusion erupts all over.

And in the midst
of all this chaos,

our little Claire takes everybody
out one by two by three.

We found her fingerprints
on all of the murder weapons.

And Claire keeps mumbling that
Miss Darrode killed everyone.

That's how it happened--
In her head.

Still hard to believe that...

one little girl took out all
these people all by herself.

The facts don't lie, buddy.

They never lie.

We'll see.

Babe, it's either now or never.

You ready?

Okay, I'm ready.

So... this is it.

Does it look the same
as you remember it?

Pretty much.

I found the first body there.

Then another one on the stairs.

You said there were more
of them in here, right?

You said there were more
of them in here, right?

Yeah. Four more.

It's so weird.

After the police found me
on the floor,

my family moved out of town so fast
that I never saw this house again,

but I remember everything
like it was yesterday.

Not everybody discovers
a massacre.

So, was the therapist right?

So, was the therapist right?

Do you feel better
now that you've seen it?

Yeah, I do.

Thanks for driving me
up here, babe.

That's what us boyfriends
are for.

Oh, I've had nightmares about
this place my whole life.

But now that I'm here,
I can see it's just a house.

That's all it is.

What's happening?

I didn't--

I-I didn't do it.

I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

She's still out there!
