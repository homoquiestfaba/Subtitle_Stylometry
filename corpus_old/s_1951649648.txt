Thank you. You can step away.
Stop it, Mackenzie. Please.

Thank you. Your son's epileptic?.
I don't know.

What?. Has he been like this before?.
Yes.

Right. Can you hold his knees
up against his chest?.

Yeah, yeah.
Ifyou can do that.
Okay. The other hand back here.

This is Campbell?
It's Mackenzie, Campbell's brother.

Mackenzie?. Right.
Come on, Mackenzie. Come on, baby.

Mackenzie,
I am Dr. Garrigan. Okay?.

We're gonna
sortyou out.

We'll get you to hospital. It's gonna be fine.
No, no, no.

The president will not allow it.
I really think the child-

You must do whatyou can do from here.
The child has to go to hospital.

Please! Please.
[Mackenzie Gasping]

Mama's here.

Don't say sorry.

[Murmurs ]

This is where you live?.
Yes.

Why not at State House
with the otherwives?.

Since I had Mackenzie, my husband prefers us
to be somewhere more private.

That's ridiculous.

I think this child
has epilepsy.

It's a perfectly treatable
condition.

The president does visit you here?.
He visits the children, not me.

I am a bad omen.

[ Sniffles ]

Okay.

Okay, I'm gonna make an appointment
for Mackenzie at the hospital.

All right?.

I will tell the president
how helpful you have been.

Good morning, Nicholas.

I could not go without thanking you
for helping my son-

Don't mention it.

and to bring you
a small gift.

No doctor should be
without his ambulance.

[ Laughing ]
For me?.

Yes. Come. Come.
This is yours here.

Oh.
[ Laughs ]

Uh-huh?
What doyou think?

Areyou serious?.
It-It's a fantastic gift.

Areyou happy now?. Eh?.
Let's try it.

You can drive me to the airport.
I have to fly to Libya on business.

Don't you think that I should get dressed?.
Quickly then. Quickly.

Now?. Right.
Yes.

I'll just be a minute.

Areyou comfortable here?.
Yeah, very much. Thankyou.

Ah.

So, uh, it- it was Obote's men
who attacked the prison, yeah?.

Yes.
Right.

We heard the gunfire
all the way at the hospital.

Yes, and my soldiers, they held them off.
Oh, right.

We thought we were going
to be inundated with casualties.

Do you want to drive your car?.
I want to see you drive your car.

Okay.
Please. Come.

Come.
Okay. Okay.

[ Laughing ]

So, you do not like the way
I treat my son.

Uh, no.
No, I don't.

Hiding him away like that,
it's-it's ruining his life.

That boy
has everything he wants.

Except the treatment
that could save him.

He has comfort
and luxury in life.

Money?. Sir, it's no substitute for anything.
Nicholas.

You have never been poor.

What about Kay?.
Don'tyou think it's, uh-

Do not speak about things
you do not understand.

But the way
you are concerned...

it has touched me,
and I will consider.

You know, I like this type
offrank conversation.

Yes. I respect
your honesty...

andyour opinion
completely.

Nicholas!
