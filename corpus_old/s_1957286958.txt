There was a prostitute

I've seen her before.

She'd actually be
a great catch.

She probably knows
a lot of people.

I doubt any of them
care about her.

Jessie, I don't know.

I don't think that I can keep
doing this.

He's our brother.

I know, I know.

Then, what is it?

He's sick,

he's not getting any better.

We shouldn't be doing the

So what do you suggest we do?

I don't know.

I heard some kids playing
outside today.


When it was bright out.

You're not supposed
to be awake at that time.

You know this.

[Thomas groaning]

Sorry.

Why were you awake?

'Cause they woke me up.

What did you hear?

Voices, and...

and...

yelling, and laughing.

Do you think
they're still out there?

Everyone's asleep by now.

We should get some
work done anyway.

Do you ever think about
going somewhere else?

I need to get some ice.

Why do you ask?

Just thinking.

About leaving?

Maybe.

Maybe?

Yeah.

Well, where would you go?

I've never been to the beach.

I went to Miami once
in the '90s.

Yeah?

It's nice.

It's not what it looks like
on TV.

What's it like then?

It's crowded, hot.

But you can be naked all day.

Here.

[zipper zapping]

Did you break it?

[Dwight chuckling]

No.

[zipper whirring]

There.

What if we just left?

To Miami?

Anywhere.

We could...

We could get in my truck and...

Is Dwight gonna eat with us?

[Jessie exhales deeply]

You know, I was thinking

maybe we could all
go out sometime.

Where would we go?

Anywhere.

I mean, I think it would
be good for all of us.

[Dwight grunting]

I was just telling Jessie

that I think we should all
go out somewhere together.

I'm too tired.

I can go with Dwight.

There's no one out

Not here.

Not anywhere.

No, that's not true,
that's not true.

It's three o'clock
in the morning.

I need friends.

[Jessie] You have us.
No, no real friends.

Not family, real friends.

You have no business
going out at this time...

I can make friends
with those kids

who are always outside.

I bet we'd be into a lot
of the same stuff.

Yeah, and where would
you find them right now?

Well, when tomorrow morning

when they're out there,
you or Dwight,

you could go out and you can
Can we talk about

Listen,
that's not happening.

Dwight, you could
tell them, right?

Right?

I don't know.

You don't know.

Hey.

I have a lot of things
to do tomorrow.

Okay, well...

No, Thomas.

No, what if we
just went around

for a little drive together,

all of us, on a little...
No.

[Thomas moans]

You never listen to me.

What?

You never listen to me.

That's not true.
That is true!

Lower your voice.
