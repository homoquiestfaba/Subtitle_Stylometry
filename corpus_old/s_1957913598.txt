[bicycle bell rings]

[indistinct chatter]

[blowing bluesy riff]

Thank you.

Once upon a time,

in a small town called
St. Joseph,

there were two ordinary people

who were destined
to be together,

in a very extraordinary way.

[background music racing]

Oh! Oh, my gosh, I can't.

I can't, I can't,
I can't, I can't, I can't.

I mean, "Hey, Alex."

"Oh, you, me?
You don't know me."

"I've just been stalking you
every day for a year."

"Oh, and this?
This is nothing."

"This is just a box with every
detail of your family history in it."

You just walk up there
and you ring that doorbell.

Yeah, if you don't do it,
you little twit,

then I'm done talking to you.

Fine, fine.

Nope, nope, nope.
I'm not doing it. Nope.

Why is this so hard?

I mean, it's not like
you're marrying the guy.

Just, um... baby steps.

Yeah, baby steps, okay.

Ha ha, nope, I said, baby,

too much, too soon.

I'm not for you.

Whoo! [laughing]

Now!

Shoot!


What the heck am I doing?


[woman shrieks]
Whoa! Jeez, I'm sorry.

I am so sorry.

Oh...

Are you okay?

Eh, uh, it's-it's, it's you.

I-I-I mean, I wasn't, uh...

You're... you're Olivia, yeah?

Y-Yes, yeah.
Yes, I'm...

My gosh, it's so good
to see you.

I've heard a lot about you.

I'm Alex.

Hey, Alex.

Okay, can you help me
with something real quick?

Yeah, yeah.
All right.

So, I'm really late right now.

I'm actually supposed to be
inside right now for your big surprise.

Can you pretend to be
surprised when you're in there?

Oh, oh, yeah.
Yeah.

I-I'm down. And I'm up.


And I can be around, too.
You know.


You're cute.
[snorts] Oh.

I like that.
[laughs]

All right, so I'm
going to head around back,

and I'll see you inside.

Okay... oh!
Ooh. Whoa.

Just this way, this way?

It's like
an unintentional tango.

Oh, yeah...
Spin move, spin move.

All right.
Spin, spin, okay.

I'll see you inside,
and remember, be surprised.

Yeah, surprise!


Hello?

[knocks on door]

Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

[lights buzz]
[all] Welcome!


[thwacks]
[woman screams]


Oh!

Eric, what did you do?

Oh, my gosh, we killed her.
[woman sighs]

It was supposed to be part
of the surprise.

Well, you were late.
I couldn't get the costume on!

Had to cut off the feet.


We just killed off
another family member.

Aaah!
I think she wet herself.

Oh!
[man] Get 'em up.

[audio rewinding]

when their life is about to change.</i>

<i>When you've been around
as long as I have,</i>

<i>trust me,</i>

<i>nobody sees it coming.</i>

[peaceful music playing]

<i>But this is where
our story begins.</i>

<i>With Olivia.</i>

<i>She's the one I've been...
assigned to.</i>

<i>- She lives in a little apartment...</i>
Good morning.

<i>...with her quirky roommate
and two small dogs.</i>

<i>But she is desperately alone.</i>

Looking good, Charlotte.

Good morning.

<i>What makes this assignment
more... "fun"</i>

<i>is selecting the stranger</i>

<i>that will set Olivia's path
in a new direction.</i>


Right on time,
between 7:00 and 7:15.

Let me guess, you'll
perfectly fumble something

only to turn it into
a wonderfully witty moment.


Isn't that cute?

And now you'll walk past me.

And, uh, not even notice
I exist.

Out of my life again.

Until tomorrow.


<i>has no idea what's coming.</i>

Olivia works as a consultant
and researcher

at a smalltown genealogy library

called Homemade Heritage.

She researches people's
family tree

and discovers unique,
interesting details

about their forgotten past.

<i>Olivia is one of the top
genealogists in the state,</i>

<i>always collecting information,</i>

<i>photos, even artefacts,</i>

<i>all to compile
a beautiful heritage chest,</i>

<i>but filled with
some other family's legacy.</i>

We have worked so hard on this,

and I cannot wait
for you guys to see.

So this is
your family heritage box.

Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

Oh, my goodness!

[cheery music playing]

<i>that's where Alex comes in,</i>

<i>the cafÃ© guy?</i>

Alex works
as a clerk for the city.

He's honest and trustworthy.

He's great at his job,

because he's good with people.

Ah, Mr. Mayor.
Yes.

<i>But what I really like about him</i>

<i>is that he's extremely loyal.</i>

<i>He doesn't quit on people.</i>

<i>And with Olivia's frail past,</i>

<i>that's exactly what she needs.</i>


Elevator's ready.

Thanks, Frank.

All right, I got a hot one.

RT35, sweet old lady
stuck at the elevator.

Frank again?

You got it.

Fine.

Thank you.

<i>So, I know what you're thinking.</i>

<i>Easy. Girl bumps into boy,
they fall in love.</i>

<i>End of story, right?</i>

<i>But those aren't
the assignments they give me.</i>

<i>No, no!</i>

<i>They call me in
for the tricky miracles.</i>

<i>I'm talking one-in-a-million,</i>

<i>harder-to-pull-off,
legit miracles.</i>

Olivia and Alex live in a city

where people pray
for miracles every day.

But if you're paying attention,

you may just happen to see one.

[peaceful music playing]

<i>Listen, you could say
nothing surprises me now,</i>

<i>but when I was
assigned to Olivia,</i>

<i>well, her story
caught my attention.</i>

You see, Olivia
never knew her parents.

She grew up as an orphan
at the Noyes Home for Children,

until she turned 18.

<i>She tried hard to find out
anything she could</i>

<i>about her past.</i>

<i>She never did find records
about her parents.</i>

<i>But she did find something
left behind.</i>

<i>So, for almost 30 years,</i>

<i>she searched and searched</i>

<i>for clues to her family tree.</i>

<i>And so this is where
I'll leave you,</i>

<i>one day, three hours,
and 12 seconds</i>

<i>before Olivia meets Alex,</i>

<i>that cafÃ© guy.</i>

[keying]
Okay, you do realize

you don't get paid more
for working late.

Hey, girl. Yeah, I know.

I'm starving.

All right, see ya.


Yes, me, back here.

Ah, I take it the Internet quit
working at your apartment.

Hey, Oscar.

No, I'm just sitting here
trying to figure out

why I haven't received
my DNA test results yet.

And all of our other clients
have received theirs,

except mine's the only one
that's actually having issues.

Well, I'm sure it's on its way.

Um, but I'll keep an eye out.


Hey!

You'll find your family
sooner than you think.

Yeah. Just remember, pound
on every door until it opens...

I know.

...or you knock it down!

[Oscar laughs]

You've been saying that
since I was little.

And one day you'll believe it.

Maybe.

I've got something for you.

[clears throat]

Today is your 12th-year
anniversary.

Now, I wish it could be more.

Oscar, you know, you really don't
have to keep giving me money.

I mean, I actually am caught
up on all my bills this month.

Who else can I spoil?

My wife and I
never had any kids,

and you're the closest thing
I have to a grandchild.


Merry Christmas!

It's July?

[Oscar sighs]

I'll see you later.
You got the keys to lock up?

Uh, yeah.

No, I don't.

I'll see you on Monday.

I love you, kid.


[rhythm-and-blues playing]

So, what's up?
Okay, so, get this.

So I hand this lady her heritage chest, right?
Mm-hmm.

And she starts bawling her eyes
out because of her deceased husband.

It was seriously
the sweetest thing.

That is so sweet, and that is what
I want, a long-term relationship.

But Jerry's just, like, can't figure it
out. He's stuck in bachelor mode.

Well, you boys didn't have
a problem committing, did you?

No, you didn't. No...

Okay, how do I look?

Uh, I mean, great. But you don't
need to get dressed up for me.

It's just pizza and movie
with the boys.

[knock on door]

Come in.
Wait!

What?
Livs, I told you on Monday.

Movie night with Jerry
on Friday.

It's a Friday.
Oh.

Yeah. No, that makes sense.

I thought, you know,
you meant you, me,

movie with... the boys.

Oh.
Just must have got my men confused.

Hey, Liv. Hey, babe.
Hey there, hi!

Listen, I just need, like,
half a second.

Well, honey, you look fine.
We're gonna be late. Uh...

all the time.

Yeah.
Can't find the right rose-colored lipstick.

I know, yeah.
Just keep it on you at all times.

It's a thing, it's a real thing.

Okay!

Oh.

Livs, I'm sorry.

Next week?

Yeah, sure.
Yeah, it-it's fine.

You guys go and have fun.

I've got these guys
to keep me company.

Great, let's go.
Yep.

Bye!


All right, pizza, ice cream?
Our secret?

With syrup, let's go.

[TV reporter] <i>...a joyride in
what police say was a stolen car...</i>

[peaceful music rising
over newscast]

[sirens wailing, horns blaring]

Okay, okay, don't panic, don't
panic, don't panic! All right, all right.

Hello, hello? Olivia?
Olivia, pick up.

Pick up. Olivia! Pick up!

[upbeat ringtone playing]
[Olivia] Whoo-whoo-whoo!


[ringtone continues]


Pick up, pick up!


Hello?
<i>- Ah, Olivia! Hey, it's Tim.</i>


<i>- Um...</i>
Hi, what's up?

<i>My car</i>

blew up, and I'm in Kansas City.

Tim, I'm kind of busy right now.

[truck beeping]
<i>- Olivia!</i>

We both know you're never busy.

Not to be rude, but you're
probably burning cookies, again.

Okay, kid, I think
that looks good.

You know, the client
I've been working on

for, like, months?

Yeah, the Benjamins.

<i>No, no, no!</i>

<i>The Baileys!</i>

<i>They've got someone</i>

picking up their heritage chest
from the airport later today

in, like, 20 minutes.

I can't be there.

Okay, well...?

Can you meet the lady
at the office?

What?

<i>Olivia, I really need</i>

this favor.

If I mess up one more project,
Oscar's gonna fire me!

<i>Oh, um, all right,
fine, fine, fine!</i>

I'll do it. I will go to the
office and meet your person.

<i>So, the lady's name
is Olivia Bailey.</i>

<i>She'll be there around</i>

2 p.m. from the airport.

She just needs
the heritage chest.

Olivia Bailey,
Bailey heritage chest, 2 p.m.

Got it. I'll be there.

[phone beeps]
Thank you, thank you, Olivia.

You don't know
how much this means.

I mean, I mean, I mean,
maybe you and I should like...

celebrate some time, you know?

Like you, me,
a candlelit dinner,

maybe some spaghetti.

Olivia.

Is this some fake hang-up?

Is this a fake hang-up?

Okay, it's real.

[engine revs]

"Hey, Olivia, you wanna go
downtown and help me with my client?"

"Yeah, would you just like
to give up your free night,

your weekend,
to go help my client?"

No, Tim, I don't.

"Olivia, why don't
you ever have a boyfriend?"

Because of people like you, Tim.
I'm always cleaning up your messes.

Ah, man, thank you, man.
Thank you so much.

Sure, sure. Hop in.

Yes, sir.


[clock ticking]

Yeah, of course. Just...

[laughs softly]

[R&B ringtone playing]

[Tim] <i>Hey, Olivia.</i>
Hey.

Your lady never showed up.

<i>She never showed up? What?</i>

Yeah. Been sitting here
for over an hour, and no show.

<i>Oh, no. No, no, no, no.</i>

<i>They have some family
reunion thingie tonight.</i>

<i>That chest is supposed
to be there.</i>

<i>If it doesn't show up,
we don't get paid.</i>

That's just not our problem.

If they cannot show up,
then they have to...

<i>- You're right. You're absolutely right.</i>
Uh...

<i>Totally, totally,
I agree with you.</i>

<i>Now, maybe I can
get there later and...</i>

You've got to be kidding me.

<i>It's the right thing to do.</i>

<i>It's the chivalrous thing to do.</i>

<i>Let me take the mantel.
Let me take...</i>

Alexander Bailey.

<i>- They brought this into your lap in the first place...</i>
Alex.

[chords strumming on harp]

[needle scratches record]

<i>...take away the pain,
come on...</i>

You know what? I'll do it.

I-I-I can take the box to the, uh, to their, uh...
<i>- Wait.</i>

...reunion party thing,
yeah, I'll do it.

<i>No, you don't have to.
It should be me. Come on!</i>

Tim, I'm gonna take the box.
Just send me the address!

<i>- Uh, um...</i>
Goodbye.

Oh, my gosh. Okay.

I don't even know
what I'm going to wear.

Gosh.
Having to shake my legs...

[peaceful music playing]


<i>I'm sure you've realized by now</i>

<i>that this is the turning point
in Olivia's life.</i>

You just walk up there
and you ring that doorbell.

I said, baby,
too much, too soon.

<i>Using baseball terms,
I call it the changeup.</i>

<i>I pitch it slow,
and she figures out</i>

<i>how to knock it into the field.</i>

Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!

You're cute.
[snorts] Oh.

I like that.

Be surprised.
Surprise! [laughs]

Welcome!


screams] - [man] Oh, my...

<i>Well, now that
you're all caught up,</i>

<i>it's time to discover how
Olivia's destiny untangles.</i>

[suspenseful music playing]

[playful music playing]

[inhales deeply]

Ow.

Ow...

Oh.

[groaning softly]

Oh, man.

Oh. What?

Oh, God.

Oh...

[in singsong] Good morning.



Um...

whose clothes are these?

Oh, it's all right, sweetie.

I have lots and lots of these.

Been wearing them for years.

Where are <i>my</i> clothes?

Well, we're washing them.

You wet yourself pretty good
when you passed out.

Where am I?

You're home now, dearie.

Oh, you're safe and snug
in grandma's arms.

[laughing weakly]

Good morning, Nana. We're here.
[revs drill]

[footsteps clatter on stairs]

Hey! Nice PJs.

Yeah. Who shot the carpet?
[Olivia laughs nervously]

Nana, where do you keep
the Phillips head screwdriver?

Oh, well, they're
with my power tools.

Oh, Olivia,
I'm so glad to meet you.

And I'm so happy you're alive.

So, uh, how are you feeling?

Uh, I...

Uh, better, yeah.

We've got coffee
downstairs in the kitchen.

Help yourself to a cup
if you want one.


You know, I'm...
I'm really sorry

you had to, um...
see me like this.

Are you kidding me?
We're family.

You could even wear
<i>my</i> PJs if you wanted to.

[laughs weakly] Uh...

Fa... fa... family?

Family? Oh, my God,
what's he talking about?

Tim! Oh, text.

My phone, my phone, my phone.

Okay, okay.

Okay, Tim, where is your text?
Tim. Oh. Okay, um...

"Drop off the Bailey family
heritage box

at their family's house

by their relative
Olivia Bailey."

What? <i>I'm</i> Olivia.

What...?

They think I'm Olivia Bailey?

God! Oh, no, no.


Oh, no.

Okay, um, okay, okay.

I'll just get my clothes
and just explain to them

that, hey, this was
just a big misunderstanding.

She... she's Olivia,
I'm Olivia.


It's funny!

But what if Alex
doesn't find it funny?

What if Alex gets mad
and what if...

what if he says he never
wants to see me again

because he thinks that I lied?

No, scrap that.

Can't do that one.

Gosh, okay, okay, okay, think.

Okay, oh. Lord, this nightgown.

I've got to get out of this.

Washer/dryer, find my clothes.
Find my clothes.

[suspenseful music playing]

[blows hair]

Oh, the dryer, dryer,
the dryer, dryer...

Olivia!
[screams]

Oh! Oh! [laughs]
Oh-oh!

I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

Whoo, you got me there.

Um... I was just, um...
I was looking for my clothes.

'Cause... well,
these aren't them. [laughs]

Clothes, yes.
In the dryer, not quite done.


Oh! Hey.

I'm Ellen!

Eric, Alex and Melissa's mom.

Oh! Olivia.
It's so good to see you.

Finally!

Are you feeling all right?
Oh, yes, yes.

Um... better.

Well, we were all
so afraid when you fainted.

And I told the boys I'm nervous
about such a big surprise like that.

Hmm.
And that's what I said. I said, "This is a bad idea."

Hey, nobody listens to me.
Olivia, that's Mike, my husband.

[Mike] Hey.
Hello.

You're gonna learn that these young
knuckleheads have no shortage of bad ideas.

I don't even know who's worse:
Alex, Eric.

Hey, don't worry about it.
Got your back.

Have you met Beverly yet?

Yes, um, she actually lent me
her nightgown.

Oh! Is that what that is?

I thought for a second you both
had the same taste in clothes.

[laughing]
Comin' through!

Whoa!
Hi. Could you sleep well?

Eric, do you have to drag
those things through the kitchen?

[Eric] Nana wants it up.
[Mike] Guys, do you have to go through the kitchen?

Hey, we got the, uh,
bathroom mirror installed.

Looks amazing,
and Nana loves it.

Sorry.
Hey, Olivia, where are you staying while you're in town?

Um...

Don't answer that,
you're welcome to stay with us.

Or at Alex's place. He has
a lovely home on Crestview.

Oh, Mom, she doesn't
want to stay with me.

Oh. - I mean, you can if you want.
[Olivia] Uh...

Actually, you know,
I have, um...

I've got a friend here, and
I can just, I'll stay with her.

Oh, well, that's wonderful.

Okay, Mike, why don't you write
down all our numbers for Olivia?

[ringtone playing]
I'm on it.

Oh, oh, um, you know what?

I gotta, I'm gonna take
this call, so I'll just...

Important, so, excuse me.
Okay. [laughs]

[indistinct chatter]

Olivia, oh, my gosh.
Where are you?

I've been trying
to reach you all night.

Sofi, Sofi, Sofi,
Sofi, listen to me.

things got really complicated.

<i>I'm running around the house.
They're inside the house.</i>

Just...

Okay.

Um, okay, okay, um...

So, last night I was trying
to deliver the heritage box

to one of our clients, okay?

And, um, I just freaked out

because one
of the family members

is the same guy that I've
been stalking at the cafÃ©.

[inhales sharply] The cafÃ© guy?

The one with the perfect style
that you never talk to?

Yes! The same one.

Oh, God, I think I'm drowning.

[breathes loudly] Okay, no.

<i>No, that's not even
the worst part.</i>

<i>Somehow I faint,</i>

and they think I'm
their long-lost relative.

Guess what her name is?
Olivia.

<i>I want to tell them, um,
'cause if I'm being honest,</i>

I want to stay and get to know
the hot cafÃ© guy.

this is a perfect situation for you

because... this might be
your destiny falling into place.

<i>Yeah!</i>

[woman on-screen] Probably not.

I mean, he's got a normal job,

and I like things, I like money.

Does that make me superficial?

[horn beeps]
Okay, yeah, I could do this.

he's sweet and he's cute

in his own little
awkward kind of way,

but do I want to spend
the rest of my life with him?

Probably not.

Hey, did we cut out? Hello?

Hello... Olivia?

things off, but then I found out

that his parents,
they're giving us, like,

this huge mansion
as a wedding present,

and I was like, "Ch-ching,
sign me up." [laughs]

We get married.

Couple months later, we divorce,

and half that house is mine.

It's worth it, right?

[Sofi] <i>Olivia?</i>
Sofi!

<i>Hello?</i>

Hey, Olivia!

Look, I'll call you back later.

I'll head back
to the apartment soon, okay?

Am I shallow?
Okay, I didn't think so.

But this house...
Dang.

...I hear it is very big and very expensive.
Feel bad for that guy.

Hey, I'd better let you go.
Okay, yeah, I've gotta see him.

Yeah, put on my smile. Bye.

I went ahead and pulled these
from the dryer.

Okay, thank you.

Uh, Olivia, uh, real quick.

Before you go, there's somebody
here that I want you to meet.

All right? Don't go anywhere.
O-Okay. [laughs]

you made it.

[woman] Aw, thanks.
We found a new family member we never knew.

to meet your family right now.

I haven't... I'm starving.
[Alex] She's in the kitchen right now.

I could rip its face off, I am so hungry. Ugh!

All right, here she is!

[Ellen] Oh, Megan, I'm so glad to see you!
Oh.

I'm Ellen, Alex's mom.

I'm Mike, Alex's dad.

This young man here, this is
Eric, his little brother.

So, this is the fam. Oh!

[Olivia giggles]
And this is Olivia,

our long-lost relative.

Part of the fam.
[Megan] Long-lost relative.

Um, it's so nice to meet you.
[Olivia] Nice to meet <i>you.</i>

[clicks tongue] - So,
Olivia is in the Peace Corps.

She just recently came back
to the States.

I'm sure she's got
a million stories to tell.

Ehh.

to hear them all.

I can't wait either. [giggles]

So, you know what sounds
amazing?

Like a little glass
of red Chardonnay?

Babe, it's 9:30.

I'm kidding!


But I am so hungry.
That's so good.

I mean, I have to eat
every 27 minutes.

Oh, yeah.
It's the new diet that I have, so...

Her metabolism is
lightning-fast.

So nice meeting all of you,

and you, see you later.

Bye!
[family] Bye!

[Olivia laughs nervously]

Oh!

It was such a short visit.

Isn't she great?

She is! She is!

Sweetie, oh.

She's great.
[Eric] See ya.

[gasps]
Olivia!


Sorry, I thought I saw a spider.

It was just... it was my keys.

Well, I-I just wanted to say

that I know that you have
come a long way

to be here with us,

and I'm just so glad.

I'm so happy to have
a new member to our family.

Oh.
[sobbing loudly]

Oh, goodness, okay.

[Ellen bawling]

[bawling stops]

[bawling resumes]
O... kay.

Okay. Good, me too. Me too.
Oh!

Hon, we ought to invite her to the
engagement party at the River Bluff.

The engagement party
at the River Bluff.

Oh...

I... I don't think
I could impose.

Oh!
It'll be fine.

Oh! I mean, the engagement
was a little... soon,

but they're going to get
married in two weeks.

Can you believe it?
Wow!

is definitely sudden.

Since Megan lives in Seattle, Alex has been
up there visiting her for a few months,

and he finally proposed
last weekend.

Won't you come to the engagement
party and help us celebrate?

[laughs nervously]
Please!

Oh!
Sure!

Oh, yeah!

Well, I... I guess
I'll see you guys then.

Okay. Bye, honey.
I'd better go. Lots of unpacking.

Bye, Olivia.
Bye.

[crying and laughing]

Olivia! [crying]

No, no!
You've got to be kidding me.

She's totally wrong for him,
and he doesn't even see it,

and his family
certainly doesn't see it.

I mean, it's like she's got them
under some kind of spell.

So, what are you going to do?

when the real Olivia shows up?

I know, I don't know,
I mean, on one hand,

I can't keep pretending
to be someone I'm not,

but on the other hand,
I can't just stand by

and let Alex marry this...
witch of a woman.

Mm. Hmm-hmm-hmm.

W-Wait, okay, listen,
this is it.

You're going to rescue him
from disaster.

Once he sees that
you've saved him,

he won't even care that you're
not the real Olivia, he'll thank you.

Hmm, I don't know
about that one.

You just got to learn
everything you can

about the real Olivia Bailey.

And then you don't
have to make anything up.

Just spit straight facts. Done.

Easy, problem solved.

Hmm, nope.

Never gonna happen.

No, careful. Okay.

I got it, I got it.

Oh, Ooh!
[boxes clattering]

Hey, whoa! What...?

Hey, Olivia. Saw my life
flash before my eyes.

[Olivia] Sorry, Toni.
Uh... Hey, hold on and I'll help you.

[Olivia whispering] Keys,
keys, oh, my God. Oh, my God.


Hey, special delivery
from Toni, huh?

Okay, yeah, great, thanks.
And going...

Yeah, thank you, I really
appreciate it, but I'm good.

Oh, no, I'm good
with these things.

Okay, now...
Hey, let me get your keys.

O... kay.
[groans] See what we got.

No, nope, that's a phone.

Oh, yeah.
Hmm... here we go.

Ooh, hey. Oh, magic!

Oh!
Abracadabra, there you go.

Awesome. Thank you.
I'll take those. Okay.

Yeah.

So, uh, when are we gonna
go out like you promised?

Uh...
Just got paid.

I'll take you to someplace
really nice.

Toni, Toni, listen.

You're a great guy,

and you're gonna make someone
really happy one day.

It's just...
it's not gonna be me.

And besides, you know,
I've already got

two men in my life, so...
[clicks tongue]

Oh, you talking about
your little furballs in there?

They're puppies and I love them.

Okay, well, what your puppies
got that I ain't got?

More fur.

Hey, I've got fur!

And I love to cuddle.

Didn't go too bad.

Hey, Mom, I'm gonna pick up some
boxes at the bottom of the stairs.

[relaxing music playing]

<i>â™ª And you're like â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A fine wine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're better with age â™ª</i>

Ah...

[exhales sharply] Okay.

Whew! [laughs]


I can do this.

I can do this.

<i>â™ª I wanna spend
My time with you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Take my hand
Don't let go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't let go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let's practice
Growing old... â™ª</i>

Hey, uh, I'll be right back.

Yeah.
All right?

<i>â™ª Hey, hey, Suzy Q... â™ª</i>

If your date doesn't show up,
I may know a guy.

Hey there. [laughs]
Hi.

You look, uh, different.

Oh, man, that bad?

No, no, I mean, not that you
didn't look beautiful before.

Just having a hard time
believing we're actually related.

Yep, we are.

Yeah. Yeah?
Mm-hmm, yep.

We're related. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, okay.

paintball gun in hand

against four Marines.

Ha! Weaklings.

Didn't stand a chance.

[Mike laughs]

Tough as nails.

Tough as nails.

Eric, didn't you try to join the
Marines but couldn't pass the test?

[Eric wheezing]
[Melissa] Mom, what is that?

It's not true.

I worked out.

And trained.

With Marines.
[Mike] Mm-hmm.

<i>Semper fi!</i> Whoo!

Boo-yah, yeah!
[Ellen] <i>Semper fi!</i>


<i>Semper fi, semper fi!</i>

Let's take it up a notch.


So, um, Olivia...

how was it in the Peace Corps?

Yeah, I was in the Congo.

Actually, African jungle.

We would, uh,

meet with the villagers,
and, um...

"administer" food

and, um...

clothing, medicine.

You know, just...
normal Peace Corps stuff.

Nothing too exciting.


How were the people?

So sweet!
[Ellen] Sweet.

So sweet, I mean, just... sweet.

Sweet.

So, so sweet.
[Megan] Really?

I hear there's a lot of, like,
guerrilla warfare going on.

Most of the gorillas and the other
animals kind of keep to themselves,

you know, like in the zoo here.

Just cute little fur babies.

The jungle is
a pretty dangerous place.

Were you ever afraid?

You know, when you're with
the right person and people,

fear just kind of slips away.

Sometimes I felt
like I was home.

Hmm.

Ah, isn't that sweet, hon?

So sweet, yeah.
Hon?

You know, my dad
used to visit the Congo.

So, where were you exactly?
I'm sure I've heard of it.

Um, you know, it was a very,
very remote part.

Uh, Cong... a... tirea.

Congatirea.
Cong my diarrhea.

Sounds like one mean
bowel movement, am I right?

we're at the dinner table.

[Alex sighs]
You want a challenge?

No.
I dare you to eat one of these bad boys.

No, I'm good. I'm good.
Come on.

Boys!
Come on, bro!

I don't want
to ruin dinner, okay?

It's just a little ghost pepper.
[sighs] Oh, man!

So, Olivia, tell us more
about the Congo.

I have so many
questions for you.

Um, well...

Oh!
S-Sorry.


Uh, I wanna see it...

I want to see you guys
eat the ghost pepper. [laughs]

[laughs] Game on.
[Mike] All right, boys.

May the best soldier win.

Oh, Michael Steven,
don't encourage them!

Name one thing
you're better at than me.

One thing.

Shut up, Eric.

Here we go.
Here we go.

Yep.
Rock-and-roll.

Wait a minute.

Here it comes.
[Ellen] Oh.

Oh, God!

Ha! What a wuss, look at him.

Do you need Mama's bread?
Bread.

Give me the bread,
give me the bread!

I wanna see <i>you</i> do it,
you pansy!

That doesn't help, I need milk.
I need milk, I need milk.

Um, let me help you.


Oh, oh!



Oh!

No, that's not it,
that's not it.

Chip, thank you! Ahh!

More chips, more chips! Aah!

Um, bartender...
Oh, it burns!

...can we have
a big glass of milk, please?

Why did I do that?

I knew you'd flake out.

Excuse me. I'm going
to the ladies' room.

Oh, my gosh...
1%, 2%...

You're burning up, I shouldn't
have had you do that.

I'm so sorry.
Nah, that's okay.


This is nothing. [laughs]

You need my bread?
Yeah, take Mama's bread.


Oh, thank you!
Okay.

Okay.

That's better.

[Eric coughing]
[Mike] There you go.

Finish that mission.

<i>Semper fi! Semper fi!</i>

Whoo!
[Mike] Whoo! There it is.

[sighs]
Okay.

I feel better.
I feel really good.

Eric and I, we do stupid stuff
like this all the time.

Yeah?
Yeah.

It's my fault.


are you okay?

Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, I'm...
I'm feeling better.

taking it like a champ.


Well, at least
the restrooms were clean.

[vomiting loudly]
[Megan screams]

[Eric coughing]

[Megan gagging]

<i>Semper fi.</i>

Oh. Wow.

Well, your face doesn't look
as swollen, so that's a positive.

It's good, yeah, I'm doing a
little bit better, that's for sure.

I mean, besides having one of the
most painful experiences of my life,

and my life flashed
before my eyes.

Ah, I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have had you do it.

It was my fault, bad choice.

I'm actually really glad
you showed up when you did.

Really? Why?

Well, this whole family
heritage reuniting thing...

When Grandpa Frank passed away,

our family just fell
into this funk,

and, I don't know.

I think that's why I proposed
as soon as I did.

You know, I wanted to... I wanted to give
everybody something to look forward to.

But then you came along and...

you gave us all hope again.

Wow, I...

Well, I love your family.

I mean, and, to be honest,

you guys have something
I've always wanted.

You know, growing up
a lot of times,

I just kind of felt
like I was alone.

I've always wanted
what your family has.

Well, you've found us.

And now with Megan
entering the ranks,

we'll be one big family.

Yeah.

So, that brings me
to my next question.


How do you know she's the one?

Wow, you are just
getting right to it.

Yeah. I mean, you said yourself you
rushed into asking her to marry you.

Yeah, I said that.
So, what makes her the perfect fit for our family?

That was so gross.

Alex!

Alex, let's go! Now!

Yep, yep, just one sec.
Okay.

What are you doing tomorrow?
I...

Okay, so, Megan and I were
supposed to do some wedding stuff,

but she has a couple
of business calls come up,

so she can't go, and I could
really use the wedding help.

Honestly, I'm not good
at planning, and, uh...

a fresh female perspective
would be really good.

And we're related now,
so your input would be huge.

Alex, we are leaving!

All right, hey, babe, yep.
We're... I'm coming. I'm coming.

All right, so I'm going to pick you up
tomorrow at your friend's apartment.

You just text me the address
and I'll be there.

Okay.

Oh, my God!

What am I doing?

God.


I will see you tomorrow.

[laughing softly]


No.

Olivia, it's Alex.

Hey, Alex, hey!

It's Olivia, can you hear me?

What was that again?
I can't hear you. What?

Alex, hey, hello!

Yeah. [imitates static]
There's a lot of static.

No, there's no static.

<i>Breaker, breaker, Charlie.</i>

Hello, testing, 1, 2, 3.
Is this thing on?

<i>- Is it on? Is it working?</i>
Alex?

<i>Olivia? Hey, Olivia?</i>

Can you hear me? Alex?

<i>Uh, yes, I'd like one egg...</i>

egg biscuit,

bacon, couple hash browns.

<i>One for you and one for me.</i>

Okay, you're clearly a dork.

[Spanish accent] Olivia,
it is me, the great Don Juan.

<i>Are you ready
to be whisked away?</i>

Hello, Mr. Don Juan.

To what do I owe
this enchanting visit?

Are you ready to be whisked away
on a romantic adventure?


my fanciest corset and tunic,
or... a blouse and jeans?

[normal voice] The early bird gets the perfect
wedding venue, so, uh... [clicks tongue]

chop-chop.

I'll see you in two seconds.

Dork.

[peaceful music playing]

So, um...

how did you and, uh, Megan meet?

I was at a conference in Seattle

and her and I actually
bumped into each other

at a coffee shop of all places.

Really?
Yeah.

A coffee shop?
Yeah. Yeah.

It's clichÃ©, I know, but...

Well, all the cafÃ©s I go to,
uh, none of the guys notice me.

Okay, I...

I find that really hard
to believe.

Well, believe it.

If I saw you at a cafÃ©,
I would walk right up to you,

I'd introduce myself.

Hmm.
Yeah, totally.

Actually, you know what,

there's a really
great place downtown...

Macasca Coffee.

I think you would meet
someone really great there.

Yeah. You know,
I should do that.

Yeah, yeah.
You should, actually.

It's got really good lattes.

[suspenseful music playing]

Shoot!

Um...
What?

Uh, come here. Come here.

Okay, I-I need you
to do me a favor, okay?

All right, well,
what do you need me to do?

Pretend to be my boyfriend.
[Toni] Hey!

All right. What?
Please, just be my boyfriend.

Just for a minute, just for a second, okay?
Yeah.


Yo, Livs!

Hey!

Is this guy bothering you?

Uh, no.

Toni, actually,
this is my, uh...

boyfriend, Alex.

[Alex] Yep.
Boyfriend?

[Olivia] Yep.
What about us?

Toni, there never was an "us,"

and there never will be.

All right.

Toni with an "I."

Alex with an "x." Mm!
[clicks tongue]

Ain't that the truth?
Okay.

Boyfriend, huh?

Yeah, mm-hmm.

That weren't the vibes you were
giving me the other night.

There were no "vibes."

None, zero.

Zero vibes, okay?

Whatever.

All right, come on, Waffles.

We'll see you back
at the apartment, all right?

I got more vibes for you.

[Alex chuckles] - Oh, hey, Liv,
when you're done with your boyfriend,

come see your manfriend.

You know where I live. 102.

[clicks tongue] Come on, girl.

Yo, Tina! Nice!

Okay, Toni with an "I," I have to know.
Look, I can explain everything.

He lives in my friend's apartment
and he thinks he's in love

with every single woman
he meets.

Every single one.
Oh, yeah, sure, sure. Whatever you say.

Jerk.
Ow!

Hey, is that any way
to treat your new boyfriend?

Come on!

[upbeat music playing]

Good morning, Oscar.

I made cookies.

I don't know if you noticed,

but I'm not supposed to eat
that stuff,

orders from the doctor.


Parents, make sure that
you're checking the spelling

on each of those
family trees, okay?

[sighs]
Kira, how's it going?

If I have to look at one more
family tree scribbled in crayon...


Listen, I feel your pain.

Last week,
I had double the numbers,

and I had two twins that I swear
were out to murder me.

as those little devils over there.

Oh, they look kind of cute.

[Kira] Hmm-mm-mm.
[Olivia] No? Okay.

So, do you want to teach
my next family tree class?

[clicks tongue]
Girl, you're good...

...but not that good.

Just kidding.

<i>â™ª You gotta let it go
Just let it happen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Start a cycle

Whoa!

The Bailey family

I need to know everything.

Everything?

Everything.

stop rushing her, she's old.

When I get my strength back,

I will be shoving you two
off the steps.

Yes, you will.
Yes, you will, Mom.

Come on.


I have seen pictures, but...

they don't do it justice.

the inside.


[sighs]
Wow!

Yep.

So Nana and Grandpa Frank
lived here,

up until a couple of years ago,
when he passed away.

That's when Nana
moved in with my parents.

Wow! This is amazing.

Yeah.

Oh! And this
is the perfect setting.

For what?

You'll see.

The Bailey family lineage
can be traced back

as far as the Anglo-Saxons
in Europe.

They were known as the people
who loved to journey and explore.

It's in your blood.

<i>Our</i> blood.

Yes. Our blood.

Oh! This so exciting! [laughs]

Your family heritage chest
is filled with many cool items,

such as historical documents,
artefacts

and many interesting photos.

Well, we should have done this
a long time ago.

Yeah, this is really neat.

I do have one more
surprise for you guys.

In this jar is some earth

from the region of
the Anglo-Saxons in Europe.

It's like history
you can touch and feel.


[sneezes twice]

Oh.
Oh.

Whoo! [laughs]

It almost feels like
you're really there.

Amazing, right?

Old and disgusting.

Hmm.

Hey, Megan.
Isn't this place amazing?

Hey.

Good. You got here
just in time.

We're about to take a tour.

Oh.

Great.

What the heck!

What is all over my face?!

Oh, Alex, I can just see you

and Megan and all the children

having dinner right here
at this table.

She's as sweet as a button.

this place, right, honey?

Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

Oh.



So, what did I miss?

Megan and I were just talking about how we
wouldn't change a thing about this place.

Right, hon?

It hasn't changed much
since I was a kid.

And the thought of having our
own kids run around this place is...

Magical.

Exactly.

You know what, sweetie?

I absolutely love this place.

It is perfect for us.

Yeah, babe, all right.

Yeah, it's very, uh...

<i>...Harry Potter's Hogwarts,</i>

but, you know,
in the size of a house.

Ha! Yes! That's exactly it.

I was trying to think of
what it all reminded me of,

and, <i>pfft,</i> picture perfect.

Yes, that's what it
reminds me of.

So funny.

[laughing hysterically]

You, you're so funny,
and she's so funny.

You're such a jokester.
I try.

Think about all the jokes we'll
be telling each other in this house

once we're married.

Alex, this woodwork
reminds me of the craftmanship

that your ancestors did
back in Europe, all the detail.

Yeah, our relatives were
Freemasons and carpenters.

Babe, didn't you tell me that
your family helped build this house?

I can definitely tell
in the woodwork.

No, no, we never worked
on our own homes.

We always hired
that thing out, silly.

This room.
That one?


You know, I remember reading
about your ancestors

and how they had a lumberyard

and they would sell wood
to the pioneers going west.

They did. That is how
my family made their wealth

in the late 1800s.

Hmm.
Sweetie, I bet your family members

were those ones in, like,
the fancy big dresses and hats

in, you know,
the old-timey photos, right?

No, babe, my family
was extremely humble,

and they never flaunted
their wealth around like that.

Oh.

You!

you're up to.

What?
You're trying to come between me and Alex.

I can read you like a book.

not want you to be with Alex?

You guys are great together.

It's so obvious.

You have a little
school girl crush on him,

and it's pathetic.


Your "relative"?
Yeah.

He's my very, very
distant cousin.

Twice removed.

I'm not buying it.

You're hiding something.

I don't know what it is,
but I'm going to figure it out.


This place is filthy, I hate it!


know yet either.

I don't know what to do. I
just... can you please help me?

I need some advice.

Can I have your clients
when you get fired?

You're not helping.
That doesn't help me at all.

[cart rolling]

Tim, great job
on the Bailey family.

They really loved
their heritage chest.

Yeah, everything seems
to be in perfect... order.


I just got
an email from Olivia Bailey

saying that her military stay
was extended two more weeks.

Now, would somebody please
tell me how Olivia Bailey

can be in two places at once?

It's my fault, Oscar.

I...

They think I'm Olivia Bailey.

What?
I got stuck in Kansas City,

and I had Olivia deliver
the chest to their house.

And I swear that's
exactly what I was doing.

I was delivering
the heritage chest

and now they think
that I'm Olivia.

[Oscar] You <i>are</i> Olivia.
Exactly.

But I fell or passed out
or something and, I don't know,

I woke up in their house the next day and
now I'm in love with Alex and his family...

Whoa! Who's Alex?
[sighs] He's one of the sons.

And he's getting married in
two weeks, and I have to stop him

because she's totally wrong for him
and she's just going to take his house,

and it's incredible because
I've always wanted a family,

but it's also terrible and
complicated and it's a lie because...

[Oscar, chuckling] Uh, Tim,
could you give us a minute, please?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, sure, yeah,
you got it, yeah.

[clears throat]
[Olivia] I'm sorry, Oscar.

I don't know what to do.

by telling the truth.

Secondly, breaking up somebody's
wedding is not your call.

She's horrible for him, and I literally
heard her say she's gonna leave him

after they sell their house,
and he doesn't...

I mean, he doesn't
even like her, really.

So, why is he marrying her?

I don't know, but what happens

when the family loses
their family mansion?

What happens when they find out
you're not Olivia Bailey?


You're right.
You're always right.

You know, just annoyingly,
you're just so right, right.

Olivia, wait.

Now, I know that you've
always wanted a family.

They may seem like
the perfect match,

but the best family
is one that's open and honest.

You've always got me.

Thanks, Oscar.

[Alex] And is Paul McCartney still alive...
[Olivia] You know...

wreck on November 9, 1966?

So legend has it people
have actually had

near-death experiences
inside this cupcake shop.

Hmm. Pretty lofty.

Yeah. The sugary sweetness
could take you down.

Are you ready?
I was born ready.

You were born ready?
I love sugar.

Well, honey, prepare yourself
for something sinfully delightful.


[clerk] Here's your card. Thanks.
Thank you.

Thank you so much, and I've got
a little treat for you.

Wow! A whole quarter.

Don't spend it all in one place.

Don't worry, I won't.

[couple laughing]

Mm.
Wow!

So you really want cupcakes

instead of a traditional
wedding cake?

Oh, yeah, totally.
Hmm.

Gosh.

You're just so easy to talk to

and hang out with.

How do you do it?

What?

Well, you know,
take someone who's

so sure of something one minute

and then make them completely
second guess themselves the next.

Alex...

There's something
I've got to tell you.

Um, I'm not who you think I am,

and...

my past is just really
complicated,

and I wanted to tell you
the minute I met you,

but then I met
your awesome family

and they were so loving,
and I just...

Just stop.

Stop right there.

Let me tell you something,
all right?

Whatever you've been through,
whatever's happened,

okay, you're family now.

Forever.

Uh... Oh, gosh, um...
What's wrong?


Hey, guys, I love this place.

It is so cute. [laughs]

Right? Megan, what happened
to your conference call?

I was like, "Listen,
I'm getting married soon."

I have so much planning to do
and it's a Saturday

and I missed you.

doing, what you got here?

Well, we're just, you know,
sampling some cupcakes here.

Mmm...

Hmm. Mm-hmm.

That's good.

Yep, um...

Babe, I've got this appointment
at another wedding cake shop

that's a few miles away.

I mean, their reviews
are to die for.

So we really need to leave now
if we're gonna make it on time.

All right, yep, okay, all right.

So, you can come with us, Olivia, if
you want to ride in the back or something.

It's really not a problem. You should totally come with us.
Oh, no, no, gosh.

This is your guys's time. I
don't want to spoil anything and...

That's okay, Olivia,
I totally understand. [laughs]

All right.
Okay, uh, we gotta get goin'.

So, we need to go because the
car's running and we need to go.

Come on, sweetie.
Okay, all right.

See ya!
Bye!

[Olivia] Bye!
[Alex] Oh.

Come back and see us.

Thank you.
Thank you. - Thank you.

Hey... so.

Have you told him yet?

[Olivia sighs]
That complicated?

I really care about him, Oscar.

And he's so funny
and he's smart,

and he loves history
as much as I do.

I just don't want
to lose him, you know?

Isn't he getting married?

Yes, in two days.

Hmm.

It's your birthday!

Oscar, please,
please, don't remind me.

But I got you cupcakes!
Ta-da!

What am I going to do?

I'm 30 and completely alone.

Come on, come on, sit down.

Do you know how many years

I've been working
at the Noyes Home for Children?

Thirty.

[clicks tongue]
Same age as you.

I remember when
they brought you in...

<i>for months as a volunteer.</i>

<i>I wasn't prepared
when they brought me you.</i>

<i>I had hoped
that some wonderful family</i>

would come and adopt you.

You know, I prayed
for that every day.

You've always been there, Oscar.

Got you a job.


And here.

Red velvet.

Happy birthday, Olivia.

Thank you.

Mm. I'm not sharing.



Sofi.
We're gonna go, right now.

Sofi, what's wrong?

I'll explain on the way.

Are you okay?

Sofi, what are we doing here?

I told you, there's a problem
with the heritage chest.

What?

Surprise!


[lively music playing]

Don't you pass out again!


Sofi said it was your big 3-0.

We had to do something, honey.
You're part of the family now!

Hey, happy birthday, kiddo.

You guys, this is amazing,
really.

Perfect!

We're getting cake, right?

Zip it. Yeah.

Come on.

Is Oscar here?

He... should... be... here.

I'll call him again.
Okay.

Yeah, just like that, perfect.
Thanks, Mom, appreciate it.

Hey, Alex, um,
can I talk to you?

Were you surprised?

Yes, I was surprised, but, um...

I really need to talk to you,
in private.

Sure, sure, sure, okay. Just
hold that thought, all right?

Please, I need to talk to you.
Birthday girl!

Hey, just one... Alex!

<i>- All right, I just...</i>
Oh, I got it.

No, no, no.
[indistinct chatter]

<i>So, right, testing, testing.</i>

<i>Okay, if I could get
everybody's attention up here.</i>

<i>I just want to say, first off,</i>

<i>the last couple of weeks
have been incredible.</i>

<i>All right?</i>

<i>Olivia, when you
reached out to Mom</i>

<i>and you told her you
were part of the family,</i>

<i>we... we were anxious.</i>

<i>What's it gonna be like?</i>


<i>and we got to get to know you,</i>

<i>and I personally, I have to say,</i>

<i>I... I'm so glad
that you were brave</i>

<i>and that you were bold</i>

<i>and you forgave
all of our weirdness.</i>

[clicks tongue] <i>You brought</i>
<i>our family together,</i>

<i>and I...
I thank you for that.</i>

<i>Everyone, raise your glasses up.</i>

<i>This one's for you, Olivia.
Happy birthday.</i>


<i>Ooh, Olivia, my dear.</i>

<i>I'm so happy to have you.</i>

<i>You have truly opened
our eyes to our past.</i>

<i>And-and now to our future.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

[applause]
<i>- Thank you.</i>

<i>Hi.</i>

<i>Olivia.</i> [clears throat]

<i>I am Eric,</i>

<i>and I am so proud</i>

<i>to call you whatever it is
you are to us.</i>

<i>You are kind.</i>

<i>And for this family, I just hope</i>

<i>you aren't having
secret fantasies</i>

<i>about guys in bear costumes,
am I right?</i>


<i>- Am I right?</i>
Come on.

<i>we've had a great night.</i>

<i>That is it for speeches.</i>

<i>Now it's time to get some food.</i>

<i>Who's ready to eat?</i>

Wait! Wait, wait.

Wait!

[guests murmuring]

Hey, hey, babe.

I thought you said
you weren't coming.

And miss this opportunity?

I just have a few words.
Do you mind?

Oh, yeah, go for it.
There you go.

<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

<i>This is such a great night,</i>

<i>family and friends
gathering together</i>

<i>to celebrate
a very special person.</i>

<i>I have a big surprise
for the birthday girl.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>the real Olivia Bailey.</i>

[dramatic music playing]

<i>This is the Olivia Bailey
who is in the Peace Corps.</i>

<i>She is 32, not turning 30,</i>

<i>and she was the one that Ellen
invited to come to St. Jo.</i>

Please.

[Olivia Bailey clears throat]

<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

<i>I'm not sure what's
happening yet,</i>

<i>but I'm Olivia Bailey.</i>

<i>Um, I apologize for the delay.</i>

<i>My stay in the Congo
was extended,</i>

<i>and the communication was bad,
but, uh, I'm here now.</i>

Okay.

<i>So this is the Olivia Bailey</i>

<i>who was supposed to pick up
the Bailey heritage chest</i>

<i>and deliver it to your home,</i>

<i>but instead, that Olivia...</i>

<i>if that's even your real name...</i>

<i>jumped into her place.</i>

<i>Did I miss anything?</i>

some kind of sick joke?

<i>Tell us, Olivia.</i>

<i>Who are you?</i>

<i>Really.</i>

She's right.

is Olivia Anderson,

not Olivia Bailey.

I work at Homemade Heritage,

and I would have never
met any of you

if it wasn't
for a change in schedules.

You lied to us all this time?

with you all and got to know you,

the harder it became
to tell you the truth, and...

you all are the closest thing
I've ever had to family,

of mom and a dad and...

grandparents and brothers
and sisters.

I'm really sorry.

Olivia Bailey...

you're really lucky

to have all these wonderful
people in your life.

And I'm really sorry
I pretended to be you.

Olivia.

It's Oscar.

He's in the hospital.
I...

What?

I don't know what happened,
but I'm going.

I'm going.

I'm sorry.

[indistinct chatter]

<i>So, who wants to celebrate
new beginnings?</i>

<i>Anyone?</i>

<i>No?</i>

[indistinct chatter]

[mystical music playing]

Oscar?

Um... I told the Baileys.

They know everything, and it...

didn't go well.

And, um, I believe you.

I-I-I believe that...

you prayed for me every day,

that I'd find a family, but...

I realized that...


...that God gave me you.

You're my family.

I don't know who my mom
or my dad is.

But you've always been there.

Thank you.


Oscar?

Can you hear me?

No. No.

Please, don't leave me.

No, don't leave...

Please, please, no.



I'm so sorry.


[birds singing]

<i>sooner than you think.</i>

<i>I love ya, kid.</i>

<i>I love you too, Oscar.</i>

Olivia?

It's okay.

Don't give up hope.

Okay.
The time will come.

Hey.

Hey.


Uh, sorry to hear about
your... your friend.

Thanks.

I, uh...

thought you might like
some chocolate.

Aren't you supposed to be
getting married today?

I called it off.

I'm glad we're not related.

Because it's gonna make
what I have to say

complicated.

What are you doing here?

I miss you.


It's crazy, I know.

I'm in love with you.

There it is. I said it.

I've been falling in love
with you

from the very first night
we met.

And all I do is think about
getting to spend time with you.

You must not feel the same way.

You're just standing there,
so...

I'll just... I'm gonna go.

[peaceful symphonic music
playing]

I have a confession to make.

We <i>are</i> related?


I only like chocolate
with caramel.

I'm so glad this worked out.


Okay, um...

there is one more thing
you need to know.

Okay.

Will you ride with me?

Where are we going?

You'll find out.

It's good.

Trust me.

Olivia, thank you for coming.

Um, would you mind
taking a seat?

Olivia, first we need
to let you know that

we are not mad at you.

In fact, we are so happy
to have gotten to know you.

Eh... you're not the Olivia, though,
we thought we knew. [laughs]

I'm really sorry about that.

It's okay.

We just want to get to know
the real Olivia.

And you were right,

after getting to spend
some time here,

I'm really lucky to have these
wonderful people in my life.

We know why it was
hard for you, dearie.

You've been alone
for a long time.

We have something
we want to give you.

We had a delivery at our house
the day after your birthday.

We were a little confused,
so we opened it.

[man] Delivery. Sign here, please.
All rightie.

There you go.

[mystical music playing]

Have a good one.

Thanks, have a good one.

Hey, El, did you
order something?


What did you do?
What is it?

Oh, my God,
is that a heritage box?

[Ellen gasps]

We were a little confused,
so we opened it.

Olivia, it's from Oscar.

For some reason,
he mailed it to us.

Oh... B-But before
you open it,

you need to read this...
this letter.

It came with it.

<i>you this letter</i>

<i>because it's time
for you to know the truth,</i>

<i>the details of the family
from which you came."</i>

<i>"I hope, after you read this,</i>

<i>you will understand why I kept
this information from you,</i>

<i>but finally, today,
all that will change."</i>

<i>"Along with this letter</i>

<i>is your very own
family heritage chest</i>

<i>that I've been working on
for many years."</i>

<i>"But please know that
what I'm about to tell you</i>

<i>has been very difficult
for me to keep secret."</i>

<i>"You've heard me talk about my
wonderful wife Millie of 47 years."</i>

<i>"What I did not tell you
is that Millie and I</i>

<i>did, in fact, have a child."</i>

<i>"Her name was Nancy."</i>

<i>"Nancy married a prominent man
from Detroit</i>

<i>named Benjamin Strauss."</i>

<i>"Nancy and Benjamin
had one child,</i>

<i>their daughter
named Abigail."</i>

<i>"She was never married</i>

<i>but had fallen in love
with a young man,</i>

<i>his name was Paul."</i>

<i>"I think they had planned
on getting married,</i>

<i>but things were complicated."</i>

<i>"Just weeks after Abigail
left her romantic summer,</i>

<i>Paul's family moved again."</i>

<i>"Abigail never did
find out where."</i>

<i>"And shortly after,
Abigail learned</i>

<i>that she was pregnant</i>

<i>with you."</i>

<i>"Olivia,
I am your great grandfather."</i>

<i>"Abigail was your mother."</i>

<i>"And being from
a strict prominent family,</i>

<i>Abigail was forced to put
the child up for adoption."</i>

[Abigail sighs]

<i>"Secretly she was
determined to find you again,</i>

<i>wherever you ended up."</i>

<i>"And so she left you
with half of her necklace."</i>

<i>"Engraved are the initials
to your real name, O-S,</i>

<i>Olivia Strauss."</i>

<i>"Your mother
loved you so much."</i>

<i>"Leaving you and
abandoning her only child</i>

<i>was the most painful thing
Abigail had ever endured."</i>

<i>"She was escorted back to
Detroit with her mother Nancy</i>

<i>and my wife Millie."</i>

<i>"But tragically they were
in a car accident."</i>

<i>"All three women died."</i>

<i>"My deep loss
was unbearable."</i>

<i>"But the one thing
that kept me alive was you."</i>

<i>"Abigail's father Benjamin
agreed</i>

<i>that on your 30th birthday,</i>

<i>I could reveal to you
your true identity,</i>

<i>and in exchange
for my prolonged silence,</i>

<i>he promised to give Abigail's
portion of the family inheritance to you."</i>

<i>"I know it's been difficult
growing up</i>

<i>not knowing where you belong,</i>

<i>but please know that I have
loved you every day,</i>

<i>and though I've tried my best
to be a father figure...</i>

[clicks tongue] <i>...I know</i>
<i>you've always felt abandoned."</i>

<i>"Most recently,
using your DNA results,</i>

<i>I was able to identify
your biological father Paul."</i>

<i>"He still does not know
of your birth."</i>

<i>"But I have been trying
to reach him."</i>

<i>"I am grateful to God
that he allowed me</i>

<i>to spend so much time with you,</i>

<i>and I'm proud</i>

<i>of what an incredible woman
you've become."</i>

<i>"I hope to spend
any time I have left</i>

<i>helping you discover
your long-lost family."</i>

<i>"Your loving great grandpa,
Oscar."</i>

Olivia, we now share your pain.

You're not alone.

And we are going to pick up
where Oscar left off.


Are they here yet?

I got a text,
they just pulled up.

We found him.

What?

We called him, and he wanted
to come immediately.


He's outside,
and he wants to meet you.

Do you want to meet him?

Are you sure it's him?

Thanks. Have a good one.

[mystical music playing]

Are you Olivia?

Are you...

are you Paul?

Are you...

are you my dad?

I don't know what to say.

Uh... how old are you now?

I, um... I just turned 30.

I just can't believe it.

You look just like her.

Abigail, your mom.

I've been waiting for you
my whole life.

I have been searching
and I have been looking

and I...

I just...

What happened?
Why did you leave me?

I didn't know.

I didn't know.

I'm sorry.

Listen to me.

I will never, never

let you go again.

Oh, I love you.

Oh, Olivia.

I love you.

I'm sorry.

I just have so many questions.

How old are you?

[clicks tongue] 58.

[Olivia laughs softly]

Oh, um...

And I have some people
I want you to meet.

Is this your family?

My new family.

You want to meet them?

Yeah.


<i>Yep, that was it.</i>

<i>That was the first day</i>

<i>Olivia finally found her family,</i>

<i>and even her own
family heritage chest,</i>

<i>which started her on
a new journey,</i>

<i>but that's
someone else's department.</i>


I love you, and I love you.

It just goes to show you,

in a city where people pray
for miracles every day,

if you're paying attention,
you may just happen to see one.

[chuckles softly]
