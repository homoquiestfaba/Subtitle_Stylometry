Received a tip off that someone was passing
counterfeit bills

at a bar in Glendale.

This is exhibit D. Is this one of the
counterfeit 100 dollar bills

you confiscated at the bar?
Yes.

And this is a blow up
of the counterfeit bill,

a very good job.

Now, how did you proceed
after confiscating the counterfeit bills?

Our investigation led us to
the house of Mr. Feldstein.

We're searching
covered items connected

with a forging of US
treasury bank notes.

Plates?
Yes, plates.

This is exhibit E, and where
did you find these plates?

In a rolled up desk in
Mr. Feldstein's house.

Can you think of any reason
why someone would possess

these plates,

other than to print
their own money?

None at all.

No further questions.

Mr. McBride, your witness.

Thank you, Your Honor.

Detective King, these are

definitely the plates you found

in Mr. Feldstein's house?

That's right.
Take you long to find them?

Got five minutes.

Not much of a hiding place.

Maybe some people are
dumber than you think.

As yourself.

Find any other evidence?
No.

Printing press,
counterfeit bills?

No.

These plates?
That's it.

Did you print any
bills with these?

Didn't have to.
He had the,

plates and the counterfeit bills
from Glendale.

Ah, these plates?

Yes.
I think we've established that

those are the plates
at Mr. Feldstein's house.

Yes, thank you Your Honor.

With the court's permission

I would like to

examine this evidence a
little more thoroughly.

Phil?

If you'll look closely,
you will see that

the plates confiscated
by Detective King

in Mr. Feldstein's apartment,

that Benjamin Franklin
seems to be wearing, what?

A set of headphones.

And that the banner
under the White House

reads "House of Rock."

Now we all know that
Benjamin Franklin invented

many useful and
interesting things,

but I'm almost certain

that headphones were not
among those inventions.

That's not possible.

So there's no way
that those plates

could have printed
the counterfeit money

that was confiscated
in Glendale.

That's probably why they
were so easy to find.

Mr. Feldstein wasn't
even trying to hide them.

That must be a mistake.

Feldstein's a convicted
counterfeiter.

Who paid his debt to
society over 23 years ago.

Your honor, Mr.
Feldstein was hired

by a movie production company

to make dummy plates and
play money for a film

called Easy Money.

Mr. Garcia, would you stand sir?

Mr. Garcia was the property
master on the film.

I have a sworn affidavit here

that he hired Mo Feldstein
to make dummy plates

and a hundred thousand
dollars worth of play money

to be used in the movie.

I don't, you know,

I, I can't, I think...

Your honor, I have no further
questions of this witness.

Witness may step down.

Hey, you were on
fire in there McBride.

You're a regular Atticus Finch.

Hopperly might take
exception to that, but thanks.

You know Mo, you should
have destroyed those plates

after the movie production
was over, you know that?

Yeah they took
so long to make.

It was my finest work.

I couldn't destroy them.

Mo, you know the police are
gonna have to destroy them.

That's a shame.

Let's see the police
destroying a Van Gogh.

A real Van Gogh?

And we're back!

And we're here
talking with Tracy,

an aspiring singer.

Not aspiring, Marty.

I'm close to cutting an album.

I could do a number
for your audience.

Well, I'm sure that
would be wonderful, Tracy.

Unfortunately we have
our show to shoot.

Which you are the star.

So, let's get right down to it.

Revealing a secret
can be very painful.

But for other, keeping
it bottled up inside

can be worse.

Today's guest is here
because she wants to tell

her boyfriend, La
Verita, the truth.

So, let's bring out
Tracy's boyfriend, Joe.

Joe, me casa, su casa.

Thanks.
Welcome have a seat.

Hey.

So good looking.

Now Joe, you know you're here

because Tracy wants
to tell you something.

But, what Tracy
doesn't know is that

you have a question
for her, don't you?

I sure do.

Joe, the world is your stage.

And we're all here for you, pal.

Aren't we, folks?

Here you go.

You heard them.

I know it's taken
me a long time

to get around to
this, but oh heck,

I love you Tracy Ann Cannacot.

Will you marry me?

Ooh!

Joe is waiting for an answer.

But,

before you give it,

do you want to tell
him your secret?

Tracy, Tracy, Tracy, Tracy!

Tracy?

What is it, honey?

I'm seeing someone else.

What are you saying, honey.

Let's bring him out!

Hey Joe.

Hey, Eddie.

Sorry pal.

You're seeing Eddie?

Let's go man!

Frame it up.

Pull him off of there!

You knew!

You knew what I was gonna say!

Who do you think you are?

I'll kill you!

I'll kill you for this!

Well, ladies and gentlemen,

it may have take
a thousand shows

but you heard it right
here tonight, live.

I just got my
first death threat.

How sweet it is.

So, until the next time,

love, peace and happiness.

Goodnight.

Good job Marty.
Well, tell me.Magnificent show, buddy boy.

Think so?
Yeah, best yet Marty.

Congratulations, Marty.

Thank you, sweetheart.

There's nothing for
you to do except to relax

and enjoy your party.

Well, since you
say so, I will.

Okay, you can smother him
with love at the party later.

Right?

Come on.

How about if I just
give you the jacket, okay?

Now go and get my suit,

the one that I'm
wearing to the party.

Just have to press this shirt.

I'll get it for you Marty.

Whatever, chop chop!

That guy Joe,

lunatic, loved him!

You were heroic.

Really?
Oh yeah.

Death threat, I get chills.

Emmy?

Oh, Oscar, television.

It's your story.

So how does it feel
to hit a milestone,

10 years on the air.

Feels like 50.

Come on.

Get a couple of glasses
of bubbly inside you.

You'll feel better.

Look, you're tired.

It was a tough show.

Very tough.

It was a tough year.

You think?

Well, you could take
a break, you know.

Where am I gonna go?

Uh, Corma?

No come on, I'm serious.

No one goes there.

I don't know, Maui, Barbados.

Come on, get your
batteries recharged.

You know, get yourself fit.

Come out for the
next season fighting.

Pow!
Oh!

Not the face.

Love you, mean it,
see you in 30 min.

A little higher
on the right, please.

Becky, almost ready?

That's good.

You really outdid yourself
with today's featured guest.

Well, perfect way
to mark 10 years.

And counting.

Look out Oprah.

The guy was really bum, though.

Yeah, how was
he when they left?

He gave security
quite a fight.

Over there, please.

Everybody gets their moment.

Come on, the party's starting.

Ah!

Victoria, you look ravishing.

You're too good for him.

That's what I always tell him.

Hey.

Hey, Arnie.
Any sign of him?

He was a little tired.

I'm not surprised if
he's running late.

Let's give him a call.
You've reached Marty's cell phone.

Well, no answer.

He must be on his way.

Everybody!

We're gonna get ready now.

Marty's on his way down.

Just gonna be a moment now.
All right.

Hey, stop right there, you.

Freeze!

What are you doing?

I didn't do nothing!

I didn't do nothing!

I swear.

Shut up!
Get off!

Whoa, you can't come in here.

Did he use that to kill Marty?

Looks like it. That's Marty's
Viewer's Choice Award.

Some people have no respect.

Marsh.

What have we got?
Marty Caine.

Looks like he was
hit over the head.

Anything taken?

Not that we know of.

But we're still looking.

Who's the guy at the door?

Arnie Wilson,

the show's producer.

Captain's gonna love this.

In entertainment news,

police confirm this morning

that popular television
host, Marty Caine,

was murdered in his
office last night.

All right so this thing
is supposed to make us

a better cup of coffee, right?

Preparing for a party

celebrating his 10 year...

Hey, hey look.

Roberta, she looks good, huh?

Police
have take A Joseph Devine

into custody.
Hold on a second.

Didn't we have a client
named Joe Devine?

We did.

We had a client
named Joe Devine.

We wrote up a,

a record contract for him.

He was make a, a demo CD

for his girlfriend's singing.

Witnesses say Mr. Devine

made death threats
against shock talk show.

Not anymore.
Before being escorted off by security.

I didn't do it.

15 million people
heard you and saw you

threaten to kill Marty Caine.

And then you show
up at his party

covered in his blood.

I know it looks bad.

Yeah.

All right.

Tell me what happened
after the show.

I sat in my car,

steaming mad.

That guy Caine set me
up to look like a fool

on national television.

I'm down on one knee
proposing to my girlfriend.

He drags out my
supposed friend, Eddie

so Tracy can tell me
she's sleeping with him?

To Marty Caine

this is just another
episode of TV.

But to me and Tracy,
this is our lives.

What'd you do?

I thought that if I
explained that to him

he would understand.

You know, maybe he would take
more care with another guest

the next time.

Then what?

At first I couldn't see him.

You could've just
called for help.

I was scared. I...

Was he dead?
He was still warm.

And that's how you got
blood all over your hands?

I panicked.

I didn't know what to do.

Could have called for help.

I was scared.

I must've passed
him in the hallway.

Hey you, stop!

Can you help me?

McBride.

You really know
how to pick them.

Well, you know me,
I love a challenge.

Especially when I think
the accused is innocent.

Where are you going?
Detective Marsh and I

are heading downtown to
meet with the captain.

Why? We need to make sure
that this high profile case

is handled carefully.
Captain wants to be apprised in person.

Captain afraid of getting
his image tarnished?

You know as well as I that the media is going to
be trying this case as we go.

Boy isn't that the truth?

Yeah.

I'll let you guys get to it.
Thank you

Ready?

McBride Associates.

Hold on.

It's a reporter from
the National Informer.

I am in a very
important meeting.

Ah, he's in a very
important meeting.

Thank you.

Has that been happening a lot?

Ever since I
walked in the door.

Let the voicemail get it.

Marty Caine's murder
is big news, huh?

Oh, I talked to Wingy.

He said that the bail
situation is taken care of.

You've reached the offices of McBride and
Associates.

Great.
Please leave a message after the beep.

Oh.

Can I please call a temp agency?

Yes.

Tell them to send a Rottweiler.

Thank you.

It's certainly true
that money doesn't equate

to taste, does it?

Hi, we're here to
see Mrs. Caine.

Come in.

Mrs. Caine, I'm McBride.

My associate Phil Dewberry
Hello Mrs. Caine.

Please come in.
Thank you.

Can I get you
something to drink or?

No.
It's fine.

We appreciate you seeing us.
We'll try not to take
too much of your time.

How can I help?
Mrs. Caine, I hope you don't
mind my asking but,

how long were you
and Mr. Caine married?

It would have been
12 years next fall.

Very impressive.
Especially for Hollywood.
Well Marty was a big star

but when he came home to me he
would leave all that behind.

As I told you on the phone

the police believe
they have their man

but it is our opinion
he is innocent.

He publicly
threatened my husband.

He, he was caught
fleeing the scene

covered in my husband's blood.

Mrs. Caine, if I may,

there were no eye witnesses
to the actual assault.

What do you need to ask me?
There were a lot of people

who had the opportunity
that night to

kill your husband.

The people who
work for the show,

all of the guests at the party.

I'm wondering if you
could think of any one

who might have a
motive to kill Marty?

Any one?

We're talking
about show business.

Um, afraid I don't follow.

It's a cutthroat business.
There are some people who

it's not good enough to succeed.
They need their friends to fail.

That's why Marty was thinking
about getting out of television.

Retiring?

Politics

Leaving one cutthroat
business for another?

Everybody was so upset.

Told them not to come in today.

I'm sure it was
a terrible shock.

I still can't believe it.

How long did you and
Marty work together?

Since Marty moved to Los
Angeles nearly 10 years ago.

When did you last see him?
I walked into his
office about six o'clock.

So energized, so focused.

He wanted to talk new ideas
for the next 10 years,

but I told him to relax.

He'd had a tough show.

You've seen it, right?

Yeah, we've seen it.

Well, I'll let you two
do what you have to do.

I've got to get back to work.

Showing reruns today.

Thanks.

I thought Marty's wife said

he was getting
out of television?

Well that wouldn't make
Arnie very happy, would it?

Ah.

You all right?
I'll take the pictures.

No, no, no.
It's cool.

Lunch isn't sitting very well.

Right.

Primarily this area we need.

Fingerprints on the
chair, bloodstain.

We need pictures of
the doorknobs, too.

So you can dump those
on the computer,

and we can print out
all those photographs.

Oh hi.
Hi.

Did you get everything you need?

Um, for now yes.

Do you have any idea
who might have wanted

to do something
like this to Marty?

No, everyone loved Marty.

No professional jealousies?

None that I'm aware of.

Ah, what about the marriage?

Are you kidding?

Marty and Victoria were
like Rhett and Scarlet.

Didn't he leave
her in the end?

Well you know what I mean.

Like Rick and Ilsa, Casablanca.

Didn't she leave him in the
end?
Marty and Victoria were

an extremely devoted couple.

Right, I understand.
One thing that I will need

is a staff list of everybody
that worked on the show.

And all the
guests at the party.

Right.
Well you're gonna have to wait
til my secretary gets back.

I press buttons on the
computer and the lights go out.

Thanks Arnie,
we'll be in touch.

Okay.

So everybody just loved
Marty Caine, did they?

That's what the man said.

Yeah, but that's not
what Mrs. Caine said.

It's true.

All right, so Marty was hit
on the back of the head.

Right.
Where he fell.

Fell over like he was
headed toward the bathroom.

Okay, what's your point?

It's not what you'd
expect, tell me.

He's confronted by Joe

who's meant to be angry
enough to kill him.

Marty just turns
his back on him?
Marty was arrogant.

And clearly he was
arrogant enough to think

that Joe wasn't a danger.

He walks away from Joe.

And Joe what, brains
him with his own

Viewer's Choice Award?

Yes, that's what
the DA's gonna claim.

Yeah.
It doesn't really pass the
smell test though, does it?

Marty Caine turned this back

because it never occurred
to him for a moment

he was in any danger.

He walked away not
because he was arrogant.

Because he felt safe.

Which means what?

Marty Caine knew his killer.

Well, I don't know
how to thank you

for securing my
bail, Mr. McBride

Just help me prove
you're innocent.

Do you have a comment?
If you don't say anything,

they won't print anything.

Tracy?

Honey, I've always loved you.

I am really sorry about
that business with Eddie.

Honey, you broke my heart.

I know baby, I'm sorry.

But that's over.
You mean it?

Joe, do you forgive Tracy?
Well I love her.

Tracy, does this
mean you accept Joe's...
You know what?

We're not gonna answer any
more questions right now.

We'll talk to you
guys another time.

Give him some air, all right?
Thanks a lot.

I'll give you a piece of advice.
Stay away from reporters.

They're not your friends.
Okay.

Just get home and I'll
call you in a while.

Okay, thanks again.

Wow, nice house.

Think he must be making
a little bit of money

working for Marty.

Hi, Becky Tranter?

Forget it, okay?

My name is McBride.
Are you Becky?

No, and she's not
doing any interviews.

Oh, we're we're not reporters.

No we're lawyers.

We represent the
gentleman who was accused

of killing Marty Caine.

My name's Phil.

Hey.

Um, we had a few
questions for Mrs. Tranter

if that's cool with you?

She's out back.

Cool.
May we?

Thank you.

I'm sorry.
I've gotta rush.

I've got an important
audition I've got to go to.

That's fine.
What's your name?

I'm Gina, Gina Carson.

Been friends with Becky long?

We rent the place together.

Moved in about a year ago.

This has really hit her hard.

Did you ever meet Mr. Caine?

A couple of times with Becky,

Go easy on her.

Becky Tranter,
my name's McBride.

I'm a lawyer
representing Joe Devine.

Could we have a talk?

It's my fault he's dead.

I had a bunch of things to do.

I never thought, I mean,

you don't expect someone's
gonna come back and...

Take your time.

I should have
checked, you know.

If I would have just checked,

but instead I got distracted,

and I didn't follow up.

If I had done my job...

Thank you.

He seemed like a nice
enough guy before the show.

What happened after that?

I just finished up and
got ready for the party.

And you saw Marty,
you say, at around,

at 7:00 PM?

Marty was just
out of the shower.

Hey Becky.

Hey.

How you doing?

Good.

Entertainment Tonight called.

Yeah?
They need to move the
interview to Tuesday.

They're bumping me, why?

They said something about
Cuba Gooding becoming available.

Oh, oh Cuba Gooding.

Excuse me.

They're very sorry.

So your conversation
was just about scheduling?

Pretty much.
What's the real
message here, Becky?

What are they really saying?
That one lousy best supporting
actor beats my Emmy,

my five Golden Globes,

my Viewer's Choice Award?

And do they think
that the alumni

at the University
of New Hampshire

just gives their
award to anyone?

I'll be sure to tell them.

You do that.

Who cares, it's my night.

Yeah.

Go, get ready for the party.

How long had you
worked for him?

Eight years.

He knew my father
back in the old days,

before Marty was famous.

We talked a bit about that, too.

Hey.

That, that was our first show.

My girlfriend is
hairier than I am.

We've grown.

Well, now here you
are 10 years later.

Who would have thought it?

Not me.

Yeah.

Dad either.

He should be here.

I know.

See you at the party.

Did you see him
again after that?

Not until they found him.

A 10 year run.

Do you know how many
people achieve that?

It was going to be the
best night of his life.

My fault, you see.

I should have checked.

Mac, thanks for calling.

If you hadn't I'd have
gone hungry all night.

Well, not exactly the corner
booth at Muso Frank's,

but not the restaurant
that matters,

but the choice of company.

You always know
say the right thing.

What's got you working so late

flooding the captain
with paperwork?

Oh, this case is so hot.

He wants me to
handle it personally.

We've got to keep a
step ahead of the press

or we'll have mud on our face.

Anything new?
Yeah.

You'll probably read it
in the tabloids tomorrow.

Apparently the guy famous

for bringing out the
worst in his guests

had a few extra marital
secrets of his own.

Any new suspects?
We're working on it.

But what I don't
know is how you think

that there's a way out
of this for your client.

You never know.

Could get lucky.

Who knows, you might.

So the girl who
was with Marty that night,

did she check in at reception?

Aaron said Marty
gave them all passes.

You know what?
We've got to find out who she was.

Could be very important.

So what have we got here?

We've got a wife who
wasn't too brokenhearted.

Got a producer who
could get very angry.

Maybe if he thought
he was being dumped.

And several people with access.

You know what might
be a good idea?

Make friends with Becky.

You know, Marty
Caine's assistant.

She was very close to him.

See what you can learn.

You mean like...
Just get close to her.

She's a contemporary.
So she'll probably open
up to you a lot sooner

than she would to me.

Oh, my word.

31 messages.

Did you call the temp agency?

Yes.

McBride and Associates.

Los Angeles Times?

I'm sorry, he's in a deposition.

Thank you, goodbye.

McBride and Associates.

Uh huh.

Hold the line, please.

No, I'll tell Mr. McBride.

10:00 AM on the fifth.

Yes, uh huh.

And does he have your number?

Thank you, goodbye.

Eugenie Underwood,
the agency sent me.

You know that works great
with filtered water.

You asked for Rottweiler.

Welcome.

Hey, look, I
wanna talk to Arnie.

You look around, see
if you can find Aaron.

Okay.

Well I dressed Marty for
all his public appearances.

What was it like
working for him?

He was exacting.

Exacting?

Yes, everything was
Marty had to be just so.

He was meticulous
about his appearance.

The cashmere and silk suits.

The hundred percent
cotton shirts,

all hand made, of course.

Monogrammed breast pocket.

Only rule was to
make Marty look good.

How about Marty the man?

How did he treat the
people around him?

The only role was to
make Marty look good.

Marty Cain's wardrobe.

You know, I noticed that
you keep the door locked.

We've had some pilfering
of Marty's things.

You know, people are so
crazy to get their hands
on celebrity items.

I find it best to keep
temptation under lock and key.

Smart.
It's kind of weird thinking

he's never going to wear
any of these things again.

Aaron, the night
that Marty was killed

Arnie said that you
brought him his suit

earlier that evening.

Yeah, that's right.

Remember...

what time exactly?

It was about 6:30.

And he wanted his
favorite Armani,

which meant his white
Oxford button down.

So you came in, you saw him,

and you gave him his suit?

No, I hung the suit and
the shirt on the coat rack,

and I left the shoes beneath,

and I left.

Why didn't you just give
him his suit personally?

Um, well because
Marty was entertaining

one of his lady friends,

and from the sound of things

it wasn't really
time to interrupt.

You mean he was, they were...

I don't know what I mean

except that I know when
it's okay to bother Marty

and I know it's not okay.
And when he's entertaining
one of his lady friends

and I hear giggling
coming from in the room

it's probably not the
best time to bother.
Giggling, really?

I don't know.
Maybe sex with Marty is
some kind of laugh riot.

How unusual was it for
Marty to be entertaining

a girl in his dressing
room like that after a show?

I wouldn't say it
was unusual exactly.

What would you say exactly?

Marty used to get, you know,
worked up after the show.

I guess he used that
to kind of relax.

Did you happen to see the
girl he was with that night?
No, no.

He have any special girls?
Look, I don't know.

I didn't see them.
They were all the same to me.

I just kept my head
down and I did my job,

and keeping track of Marty's
extra marital liaisons

doesn't really fit my
job description, so.

I still have
your handkerchief.
What?

Yeah, you forgot
it the other day.

Oh, I, I didn't
really forget it.

I just thought it was a
bit un-chivalrous.

Plus it was soaking wet.

Yes it was.

Do you want to grab a coffee?

Sure.

This way.
Oh.

This is the green room, huh?

Gosh, I guess I imagined
it a little more,

oh, I don't know, green.

Inoffensive beige room

doesn't have the same
ring now does it?

No, it doesn't actually.

So you happen to know anything

about the woman who
was in Marty's office

the night he died?

No.

Well, I mean, yeah.

I know he fooled around
behind his wife's back,

but I never, I mean

it wasn't something
that we talked about.

Thank you.

Don't ask, don't tell, huh?
Yeah.

You didn't happen to know
who he was seeing recently

or first name, anything
he might've said?

Sorry.

It's all right.

So I guess all this
means you're pretty much

out of a job now, huh?

Yeah.

But it's Hollywood.

I'm sure something will turn up.
Here you are.

I've been looking
all over for you.
I'm coming.

Look, I gotta go.
Going to check on the editing
now.

McBride.

This won't take long.

To tell you the truth

I was kind of hoping we
were through talking.

Yeah.

Well I know that Marty was
thinking about quitting.

So maybe he was quitting.

Maybe and so what?

Well,

how'd you feel about that?

In all honesty,

it was time.

Why didn't you tell me?

Well, because experience
has taught me to never

tell people any more than
is strictly necessary.

Especially when
being forthright.

It can lead to
unnecessary complications.

Like what?

Well, like you
mistakenly thinking

that I would be devastated

by the fact that Marty
might be quitting,

and that I'd be angry over
the way he'd abandoned me

after all that I
had done for him.

Joe, let's try these on DVD.

Were you?

Why should I be?

We had a great run.
Nearly 10 years.

Besides, I got development
deals all over the town.

Good for you.
Listen, Mr. McBride,

you probably figured
out that Marty could be

a pain in the neck,

but I'm a producer,

and dealing with stars
who are a pain in the neck

is part of the job.

And in case you
really need to ask me

I can tell you exactly where
I was when Marty was murdered.

Good.
'Cause I really to ask.

Well I was talking to the
network suits on the phone

between 6:30 and 7:15.

You can check the phone records.

I will.

You know, McBride.

You're a smart lawyer.

You ever think about
doing a reality series

based on legal system?

We should talk.

Thank you, I don't think so.

Well, think about it.

Just did.

Hi.
Hi Becky.

Hi.

I'll be in the Jeep.

So, how's it going?

Are you a busy Friday?

Maybe I can take you to a
movie or dinner or something?

Yeah.

Okay great.

All right, bye.

All right, so I
ingratiated myself.

You ask her out?
Yeah.

Good, just remember...
I remember.

Keep it professional.

No, no, no, I promised, yes.

Yes, and I told him.

Okay, uh huh.

Okay fine.

Uh?
What's this all about?

Certainly glad she didn't like
my desk.
I'll tell them, thanks.

Hi.
Hi.

You're in there.

Hey Jessie looks nice.

Yeah.

Doggy fluff and fold.
So?

The Tribune wants to interview
you.
Not interested.

There's a spot on court
TV if you're interested.

No, no, no, maybe Phil?
No, not me.

Okay, WKZ is interested
in an in depth...

Pass.
Okay.

Where are the
crime scene photos?

What about all the...

The statements,
forensics and court papers.

Well, yeah.

Actually how did you know
I was gonna say that?

Nice job.

So, now that we're organized,

let's get back to it.

Any luck on phone records?
Uh, they called and said

they'll have them to me
in the morning.

Okay, fine.
Anybody on that production
staff over there

profess any knowledge
of Marty's girlfriends?

Oh it's, you know,
one of those things

where everybody knows about it

but nobody's talking about it.

Yeah well...

Okay, to do list for
the rest of the day.

I'd like you to
go over to Joe's.

Just, um, kind
of reiterate with him
the points of the statement.

He could probably use
a little hand holding
right now anyway.

You gonna be here the
rest of the afternoon?
No, I wanna go have

another conversation
with Victoria Caine.

Obviously things weren't as rosy

between her and Marty
as she led us to believe.

Um hum.

Um hum.

I've been finding out
some interesting things

about Mr. Caine.

And?

Well, to be blunt
it doesn't seem

he's what one would
call a faithful husband.

I know.

So you didn't have
a happy marriage?

I had a marriage that worked.

Look, a lot of women let
that sort of thing go by

when they're married
to a successful man.

The only thing that mattered
was that Marty came home to me.

Do you wanna get that?

No, I, I don't really want
to speak to anyone right now.

Did it hurt?

Of course it hurt.

Truth is it hurts as much now

as when I first found out
about it five years ago.

Why did you stay with him?

Because I loved him.

If you don't mind
I would really like

to just be alone
right now, please.

Certainly.

Joe, what time was it that
you went back into the studio?

You okay baby?

As long as I've got you.

Oh, now don't
you move a muscle.

I'll get that.
Okay.

Hello?
Man, I'll tell you the
phone's been ringing off

the hook since we got home.

Really?
Yeah.

Got offers coming in all over.

She got herself an agent.

He's talking about
booking studio time.

You know, when she's got
her set fully developed,

you know, fine tuned.

This trial has
been like the best

thing that could've
happened to us.

It's really made Tracy
and me understand

how much we truly
love each other,

in sickness and in health,

for better or worse,
for richer for poorer.

Joseph, you are
on trial for murder.

Yeah, but I'm innocent,

and you guys are
the best, right?

Okay, sometimes
that's not enough.

Like right now.

What do you mean?

Joe, I think you
need to just lay low

and stop taking this
all for granted.

If you're trying
to scare me, Phil,

you're doing a
heck of a good job.

I'm not trying to scare you.

I'm trying to give
you a dose of reality.

This trial, this case
is not good for Tracy

and it's especially
not good for you.

Hi, Eugenia, McBride.

Listen, I'm going to be
out here a lot longer

than I thought.

So could you hang
around, please?

Keep Jesse company and feed him?

Yes, no, no, I will, I promise.

I'll be back as soon as I can.

If you could just do that.

All right, good.

Thank you.

Yes, I promise.

Okay, Joe.
I'll go ahead and
get this typed up

and then we can
go over it again.
Sounds good.

I'm just saying if people
are showing up

becuase of me then I think it's
only fair

that I get a slice
of the pie, too.

Take care, Joe.
Hey, thanks Phil.

And please tell Mr. McBride
how grateful me and Tracy are.

Sure.
I don't care.

I mean it's either
that or I walk.

Bye baby.

I'll talk to you later.

What, did you forget your...

Hello Aaron.

Hello?

Hi Becky.

Hey, it's Phil.
Oh hey.

I was just calling
to confirm for tonight.

Well...

C'mon, need a nice night out.

I really just don't
think it would be much fun.

Just a little dinner and
some good conversation.

Okay, 7:00 PM?

Great, pick you up.

Okay great.
Great.

I'll see a little later.

See you then.

Bye.
Bye.

How long you been seeing her?
I don't think that's
any of your business.

You know something,
when I've got a client
facing the death penalty

everything is my business.

Nearly two years.

So the night of the murder
you brought Marty his clothes.

Then what?

Well I finish up a few
things and I go home.

You didn't go to the party?
No, no.

I wasn't really in the mood
to celebrate Marty's
achievements.

Anybody see you leave
the studio that night?

I don't know.
Maybe a security
guard in the lobby.

Did Marty know about
you and Victoria?

We kept it a
secret from everyone.

You know what
Marty did, though.
That just like,

clears the
way for you, doesn't it?

You really think this is
something we cooked up together?

Oh, hey that's
a good question.

Thanks for bringing it up.

Did you?

Don't be ridiculous.

Good night, Mr. McBride.

You know, I just have
this tingly feeling

we'll be talking again.

Well.

Hi.

How are you?

I'm good, how are you?

You look very nice.

Thank you.

So do you.
Thanks.

Nice jacket.

Thank you.

It's my it's my dad's.

He's dead.

I was born to it, I suppose.

What, TV?

My dad was...

Eddie Tranter, I know.

Wow, you've been
doing your homework.

It's my job.

I know that your dad and
Marty were partners once.

Yeah, I've known
Marty my whole life.

My mom died when I was a baby.

Dad raised me on his own.

He was a producer.

A bit like Arnie,
only with morals.

And Marty was the talent.

They started out at a local
cable station in Michigan,

and right from the start it
was clear Marty was a star.

And it wasn't too
long after that

that the suits out here
started to take notice.

Out you came, huh?

Marty came.

Dad didn't want to leave.

He didn't want to move me.

So he stayed and Marty became
a big star in five minutes.

Of course we ended up
coming out here in the end.

But by then dad was
feeling really bad

about himself and drinking.

I mean, there was Marty
all over TV Guide,

and dad couldn't get arrested.

Why didn't he just
ask Marty for help?

Oh he wouldn't do that.

Marty told me he offered
to help countless times

but dad didn't want charity.

One morning when I was 18,

I left to pick up
some groceries.

Dad was in a good mood.

I had just given him
a recording he wanted.

Kathleen Ferrier in
Orpheus and Eurydice.

You know it?

I'm more of an R
and B kind of guy.

Yeah well, dad loved it.

He said it was about
being lost and then found.

I got back about
a half hour later,

and the music was blaring out.

The window was open and

there was dad lying
face down in the street.

We were eight stories up.

He fell?

No.

The coroner said
there was no way,

something about the
height of the window.

No, he jumped.

When he heard, Marty
was devastated.

He felt terrible.

Said he should have made
more of an effort to see dad.

And then afterward
he stepped right up.

He took me under his wing,

gave me a job at the show.

It was like he'd
never been away.

Becky I'm...

I'm really sorry.

Hi.

I need a break.
I figured if I just called you,
you would have said no.

I want to take Jessie to the dog
park so he can

flirt with a
certain female Chihuahua.

Why don't you take
a walk with me.

Okay.

You're right.

Got your Glock?

My lady.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

I had a good time.

Me too.

You okay?
I noticed at dinner you
were kind of scratching...

I have a skin condition.

It's a rash.

I get it sometimes when I'm...

Stressed?
Yeah.

Well it's not surprising
considering all
you've been through.

I have a special
cream the doc gave me

but it doesn't seem to be
doing me much good, so.

Pretty gross, huh?

No, I actually had
this weird twitch

in my right lower lid.

And it's gotten
significantly worse

since I started
working for McBride.

Thank you, Phil.

Thank you for indulging
me and making me laugh.

It's what I do.

Goodnight.
Goodnight.

You followed me.

That was very sneaky.

My affair with Aaron has nothing
to do with Marty's murder.

The oldest motive
in the world.

What do you want from me?

I'd like to know
where you were

just before Marty's
body was found.

At the party.

And who saw you there?

Almost everybody.
Right, 10 years.

Enviable run on television.

It must have been a
very exciting party

for everyone involved.

I'm sure it was.

So it's possible you slipped
away for a few minutes.

No one would even notice.

Yes, I could've, but I didn't.

Let's just cut to
the chase here.

If I wanted to kill my husband

who took very good care of me,

you really think that I
would do it at a party

surrounded by 50 of
his closest associates?

If you have any more questions,

please just call my lawyer.

Hey.

How'd it go with
Victoria Caine?

Well, she is one smart woman.
And tough.

Yeah, I guess you'd have to be
to be live with Marty
all those years.

What's that?

Oh, this is the phone list.

Oh Arnie's?

Yes.

And did you see
on the next page.

6:23 he made a phone call
that lasted 47 minutes.

So guess he's off
the suspect list.
You think so?

Well, it's a pretty
solid alibi, isn't it?

Ever put anybody on hold?

I don't think a
producer would dare

put a network executive on hold.

No?
No.

Phone protocol in
Hollywood is a,

it's not a game.

There's a real pecking
order as to who gets

to do what to whom.

Anything come for
me from the police?
Police?

Detective Marsh said that
he was going to send me a list

of all the stuff that was
in Marty Caine's office

the night he got murdered.

No, nothing's come yet.

Can we do
something about that?

Who do you think you are!

I'll kill you!

Well, I mean, they're
convicting him on television

before the trial's even started.

I had no idea he
had such passion.

Such rage,

such intense love for me.

She is a piece
of work, isn't she?

The boyfriend is
up on a murder rap.

And she's promoting herself.

Hey Mac.
What brings you by?

Well, I've been looking
for Detective Marsh.
I can't find him.

He was supposed to send
me an inventory list

of all the stuff in
the Marty Caine office.

I haven't gotten it yet.
You know what?

I haven't seen him in a bit.

Let me see what I can do.

This is Detective Hansen.

Can I get the crime
scene inventory

for the Marty Caine murder case?

It'll be right up.

Groovy.

Your desk.

Thank you.

I know Marsh is
swamped with all of this

but I should have had that
list quite a while ago.

I'm getting behind here.

Oh, I'm sorry about that.

Marsh should have
had it right away.

I'm sure the captain
wouldn't wanna lose this case

on a technicality.

No, he wouldn't.

You will have full disclosure.

Here you go, ma'am.

Thanks Channel.

Mr. McBride.

Anything else I can do for you?

No, this is what I needed.

Thank you.

That's a switch.

What's up?

How's it going over here?

Will take a while, yeah.

73 paperclips 23
scripts, 16 pens.

It sounds like we don't know
exactly what we're looking for.

No. I was hoping that if I
come across something that...

Marty's shirt.
What?

His shirt, white
monogram shirt.

Right?
Aaron pressed the shirt and
brought it in with the suit

At 6:35, right?

Said he walked in the office,

hangs the suit on the coat
rack outside the dressing room.

So?

Come here.

So where is it?

No mention of a
shirt on this list.

Black suit shoes.

So between the time Aaron
hung the suit on the coat rack

and that picture was taken,
the shirt disappeared.

So you think the killer
took it maybe as a souvenir?

So much blood.

I mean Joe was covered in blood.

He barely touched the body.

The killer must've gotten
blood all over his shirt.

You can't go prancing around
town wearing a bloody shirt.

So you think the killer
put on Marty's shirt?

Yeah.
Then it's just a question of
getting away from the scene

and getting rid of
the bloody shirt.

What did he do with
Marty's clean shirt?

He get rid of it the same time?

No, can't do that.

Why not?
You wear it again.

That would mean going shirtless.

But then you show
up at your house

and you've got Marty's shirt.

What are you going to do?

Stick in your own trash can?

That's a liability.

How do you get
rid of something

if you don't want anyone
ever to be able to find it?

Probably burn it.
Uh huh.

Only it's late at night
when the killer gets home.

He can't exactly
start a fire then.

That's kind of,
you know, obvious.

Right?

So he waits until
the next morning.

Disguises the shirt
as something else.

And he burns it.

Good deduction.
The old saying,

hide a letter,
put it in the mailbox.

So if you're gonna
do it in plain sight

it has to look like
a simple everyday,

like burning garden waste.

Like Becky was doing.

Marty was like a
second father to her.

I know.
You gonna see her again?

Tonight.
Check out her barbecue.
Mac!

Phillip, everybody
is a suspect.

Check out the barbecue,
see that it was just
twigs and leaves.

That way we check
her off the list.

Do you have an
interview already?

Yeah. They figured if I could
take care of Marty,

I could take care of anyone.

Wow, that's great.

You know, I'm going
to get another bottle.

Looks like cotton.

Could be a white shirt.

Could be.

Okay, well

just get it to the lab.

You really think Becky did it?
Just wait till we get the

report from the lab, okay?
There could be a
simple explanation.

For all we know
Victoria, Arnie, Aaron,

half the staff burn things.

We just didn't happen
to see them do it.

Doesn't make me
feel any better.

Didn't think it would.

So around 6:30 you brought
Marty his clothes for party?

Yes, I brought him his
shirt, suit and shoes.

Are you sure that you had the
shirt with you that evening?
Yes.

Did you personally give
Marty his clothes that night?

Ah, well no.

When I got there,
he was occupied.

So I,

I put the shirt and the
suit on the coat rack

and lay the shoes
beneath to the side.

You put the suit and
the shirt on the coatrack?

Correct.

Nothing further.

As you can see, sir,
from the inventory

there is indeed no
mention of the shirts.

Seems that way.
Did you look for
the missing shirt?

Detective?
No.
Why not?

I assumed someone
was doing that.

You assumed?

Objection.
Badgering the witness.

Sustained.
Let me put it
another way, if I may.

Did the question of the
missing shirt ever come up?
No.

Why not?
I guess we were too busy
dealing with a dead body

to worry about a shirt.

Nothing further.

Animal Planet without sound.

It's his favorite channel.

This came from the lab.

I think I know what that is.

What's it say?

Material is a silk Lycra mix.

Sample too badly burned
for further analysis.

So it's not cotton.
It's not Marty's shirt.
Correct.

Which means
Becky didn't do it.

Feel better?

Ah, I feel so much better.

How are you feeling?

Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

And you?

Good.

Detective Hanson.

When the crime scene was
dusted for fingerprints

where were the prints
of Mr. Devine found?

A partial
thumbprint was lifted

from the outside door knob.

And another was found on
the chair beside the desk.

Were there any prints
on the murder weapon?

No, the surface appeared
to have been wiped clean.

Were prints belonging
to anyone else

found in Mr. Caine's office?

Yes, forensics found
hundreds of prints.

All of which were matched
with employees, friends,

or family of the victim.
It was a busy office.

So you found hundreds of
prints all over the room

but only two belonging to Mr.
Devine?
Yes.

Find it strange that he would
have wiped his fingerprints off
the murder weapon,

but not the chair or the door?
Well perhaps

the murder weapon was the only
thing he thought of.

Or perhaps he never
touched the murder weapon.

Objection.

Is there a question here?

Mr. McBride?

Withdrawn, Your Honor.

Detective Hanson,
were you in charge of this
case from the beginning?

No, I was assigned to the case

about a week after the murder.
Uh huh.

And who was the lead detective

in the initial stages of
this case?
Detective Marsh.

Why was detective
Marsh removed?

He wasn't removed.
I was asked by the department

to head the investigation
because I have more experience

in dealing with
high profile cases.

Is that the only reason
you were asked to step in?

There were several other
factors involved in the
decision.

Primarily Marty
Caine's notoriety.

Uh huh.

Would you tell us specifically
what those other
considerations were?

Objection.
The witness is not qualified
to speak for her superior.

Your honor, as
Detective Hanson

was part of the
decision making process

I would believe she is qualified
to answer the question.

Overruled, the witness
will answer the question.

I was concerned that
under the leadership

of Detective Marsh, the
investigation was not as
thorough

as it should have been.
And you,

expressed those
concerns to your superiors?

Yes I did.

Thank you.

No more questions.

Very well.

Well thank you Mr. McBride.

The witness may step down.

We will now go to recess.

Court will reconvene
in one hour.

Hi.

I found this under the door.

I have the shirt
you're looking for.

It's yours for 20,000 tickets
to the Elysian park tomorrow,

and leave it in the trash can
located near the playground.

Okay, so where do
we find 20 grand?

You honestly want to
deal with a ransom demand?

No, but someone
knows that that shirt

could clear our client.

I'd like to know
who that someone is.

So what, we're just
gonna make 20,000 dollars

appear and walk into
Elysian Park tomorrow

and put it in a trashcan?

Yes.
If you've got 20
grand lying around

I'll come back next week.

Were you leaving?
Yeah, my weeks up.

I'm booked at a nice clean
dentist office for a whole
month.

Oy!
I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.

It's been a pleasure
working with two men

who are trying to do good.

That's very sweet.

Got it.
I know where to get the money.

Tell me you did not
burn the funny money.

Ta dah!

I just keeping these
for souvenir really.

I'm going to incinerate them.
Just like you told me.

You know what,
I'm glad you waited.

Yeah.

20,000 bucks, huh?

Uh huh.

What do I need?

I'm thinking 10
percent on the dollar.

Are you?

That's funny 'cause you
know what I was thinking?

I was thinking about
the 5,000 dollars worth

of legal services you got for...


Oh, 500.

There's work involved.

Okay McBride, you're
a tough man, you know.

You're a good man,
but you're very hard.

Thanks Mo.

Hey, hey!

Get up.

So you got the shirt?

What shirt?

The shirt that
you tried to ransom

for bag full of phony money.

Believe me, you don't want to
get involved in a murder case

over a bag full of play money.

Marty was very special.

The minute you
mentioned it in court

I knew this was the shirt
you were talking about.

How?

How did you know it
wasn't an old shirt?

The monogram, see.

MC.

Now look.

That was taken last year.

See the monogram?

MTC, for Theodore.

He dropped it last year.

He changed the design.

It's sleeker.

Don't you think?

So this, it has
to be a new shirt.

Hum, very clever.

And where did you buy it?

On eBay.

When Marty died

I tried to get ahold of
as much stuff as possible.

I mean they're
collector's items now.

It's really exciting.

Oh yes, I'm sure.

Who sold it to you?

I have no idea.

What do you mean
you have no idea?

Just their subscriber name.

Well, how did you pay for it?

Online, a PayPal account.

Okay, whose name was
on the PayPal account?

Same thing, subscriber.

All right. I'll tell you what
I'm gonna need,

as much information as I can.

No, no, no.
Email me as much

as you can give me about the,

person that you bought it from.
Their email account or anything

because we've got to
find this person, okay?

That was Marty's personal
notepad

It was in mint condition.

Can we get real
names from PayPal?

If i have the time officially,

or I could just get subpoenas.

Well, we don't have
the time for that.

Well then we'll
do it unofficially.

Oh, sorry.
Just a little.

You get that off, right?
All right, you
look very nervous.

Give me this.
I need this for the trial.

I want this information
and I want it soon.

Thank you.

Okay, here's the list of
all the PayPal transactions
from March 8th,

including the subscriber
names and their details.

Must be thousands.

Maybe tens of thousands.

What's the subscriber name?

There it is.
Well, what do you know?

What, somebody you know?

Becky's not here.

Well, it's not
Becky I came to see.

I didn't kill him.

But you were with
him the night he died?

Yeah.

You were having
a relationship?

Regular sweethearts.

That was us.

How'd you meet him?

Becky introduced us.

I thought he was charming, rich.

And he knew people.

Knew people?

In the business.

Ah.

Do you think it's easy

going from one
audition to the next,

all the time seeing
others get the parts?

You want to know what it's
like when you wake up one day

and realize that waiting
for your life to begin

is your life?

And then Marty came along,

and he seemed to like me.

Me.

And I thought what's the harm?

He could, you know.

I know.

It happens, Mr. McBride.

Not everyone gets to
the top on talent alone.

I understand.

Could you just,

just tell me about
the night Marty died.

He dumped me.

He said it wasn't
working anymore.

You just get to
decide that, do you?

Yes, Gina, I do.

When?
When what?

When did you decide?

I'm guessing it wasn't tonight.

So, what was that?

That was life.

Show biz.
What about the party.

Party?
Oh, you don't still think you're
going to the party, do you?

But you said...
Said, I say a lot
of things, Gina.

You said there'd
be people there.

You'd introduce me.

Producers, agents.

And Victoria.

Do you really think I want you
and my wife in the same room?

No.

I just had to get out.

I didn't want him to see.

See what?

I thought about
crashing the party.

I figured I'd earned it,

but in the end I tidied
myself up and went home.

Must have been hard on you.

Yes.

Felt used.

With losing your
temper at Marty,

that'd be completely
understandable.

Only I didn't.

I didn't kill him.

No?
No.

Could you explain

what you were doing

with that?

So it's part of your job
to look after the guests?

That's right.

Calm nerves before the show,

smooth ruffled
feathers afterwards.

Pretty much, yeah.

In all the years
you worked there

you must've been
able to get a sense

about which guests may
potentially be volatile or
dangerous.

Objection, Your Honor.

The witness is not qualified

to give expert
psychiatric testimony.
Sustained.

Did you think Mr.
Devine was a threat?

None whatsoever.

He was kind of sweet.

Thank you.

Have you lived in LA long?

Eight years.

Live alone?

Um no.

I share with someone else.

Gina Carson, right?

That's right.

Get along okay?

Relevance, Your Honor?

Your honor, a little latitude.

I promise everything
will become clear.

I hope we all fervently
share, Mr. McBride.

Please proceed.
How would you characterize

your relationship
with Miss Carson?

It's okay.
We share.

It's, it's not like we're
best friends or anything.

Arguments?

Some.

Like what?

The usual, what's
mine is mine.

I prefer it when
people respect that.

So you'd get
annoyed, say, if she,

I don't know borrowed
some of your clothes

without asking first?

Of course.
Right.

Now, as I'm sure you're aware

there was something missing
from the murder scene.

Marty's shirt, yes.

And it's possible
whoever took Marty's shirt

was also his murderer.

Objection.
This theory again.

Perhaps counsel would prefer
to stick the known facts.

Be a pleasure, Your Honor.

Fact, the shirt was missing.

Fact, it was ever found
anywhere near Mr. Devine.

Overruled.

So Becky,

it's possible that
if we find the person

who took Marty Caine's shirt,

we might also find his killer.

You agree?

I guess so.

Thank you, Becky.

You've been very helpful.

Miss Carson, how long have you
had Miss Tranta been friends

and roommates?

Couple of years.

Friendship close?

It's okay.

I understand

that you're an actress.

Aspiring is more like it.

Tough business to
break into, isn't it?

Tell me about it.

Any luck?
A little.

Just one big break away.

Ah good.

But in the meantime it certainly
helps to have

Becky share the rent.

Definitely.

Do you two share
anything else?

Clothes, for instance?

I couldn't help noticing that

you're both just
about the same size.

Sometimes Becky lets
me borrow something

when I have an
important audition.

Have you had an
important audition lately?
Yes.

And did Becky let you
borrow something for it?

Not exactly.

Becky.

Occasionally I borrow
clothes from Becky,

but I couldn't find her.

So you went to her closet

to try to find
something to wear?

Yes.

That's when you noticed
that she had a shirt that
belonged to Marty Caine.

So you replaced it
with another shirt

from her closet,

and took the Marty
Caine shirt with you.

It wasn't the first thing
of Marty's that you took,

was it?
No.

So you grabbed the
monogram shirt out of the bag

and then put something
of Becky's you'd found

in her closet in, correct?

Objection, Your Honor.

We're here to try a murder,

not a clothes barring
disagreement between roommates.

Your honor I promise you
this line of questioning

will go directly to cause.

It better, Mr. McBride.

Overruled.

You're not in
any trouble here.

But you did have a nice
little business on the side,
didn't you?

Taking Marty's things
and selling them

to collectors, didn't you?

It was just extra stuff.
I understand.

So you took the shirt and
sold it on eBay, correct?

Yes.

Matter of fact, we
found the person who

bought it from you.
He's in court today.

Ned, would you stand up please?

Thank you.

Your Honor, I have no more
questions of this witness

Mr. Kendall?

No questions, Your Honor.

The witness may step down.

This time the defense recalls

Rebecca Tranter to the stand.

The bailiff will recall
Becky Tranter to the stand.

Well, I guess we know

what happened to
Marty's missing shirt.

It was in a paper bag
in your closet at home.

Gina's lying.

Why would she do that?

Maybe because she killed him

and she's trying
to pin it on me.

Oh, but she didn't, did she?

You took the shirt
from Marty's office

and wore it because his blood
was all over your blouse.

No.

You wore it home, didn't you?

No.
Couldn't dispose
of it on the way,

so you took it home so you
could destroy it later.

No.

That never happened?

No!

You never wore this shirt?

Of course not.

I noticed that you
scratch your arm a bit.

Do you have a skin condition?
Yes.

Would you roll up
your sleeve, please?

Please.

Okay?

Atopic dermatitis.

Sort of like eczema, right?

Yes.

I have a lab
report here of tests

that were run on the shirt.

On the left sleeve were
found traces of Chlorocrasol,

emulsifying wax, purified
water, hydrocortisone.

So?
Ingredients

in an emollient
used for dermatitis,

skin cream.

This is some sort of mistake.

No, no mistake.

This is a shirt that says

you're the killer.

That you hit Marty Caine.

No it isn't.

You know that, do you?

Yes.

You know that for sure?

Yes.

No matter what
the experts say,

no matter what they found,

you know they're wrong

because this isn't the shirt.

Yes.

Because you burned it?

I don't know what you mean.

Yes you do.

The only thing is
you didn't burn it.

You just thought you did.

You never checked

to make sure it was
Marty's shirt in the bag.

Why would you?

Gina certainly wasn't
going to say anything.

She shouldn't have been in
your room to begin with.

Boy all this time,

thinking you got away
with it and you know what?

You nearly did.

He should've
been more careful.

He should've watched
what he said.

He knew my father
in the old days

before Marty was famous.

We talked about that, too.

Becky, that photo,

that photo is from
our first show.

My girlfriend is
hairier than I am.

We've grown.

Now, here you
are 10 years later.

Who would have thought?

Not me.

Dad either.

He should be here.

He'd be in his office
blasting some opera.

Madame Butterfly, or singing
at the top of his voice

The Marriage of Figaro.

Becky, those were his favorites.

And Orpheus And Eurydice.

Playing that morning.

Wait, you were there?

He called me,

begged me to come over, talk.

I did.

Your father, all he wanted
from me

was to let him produce the
new show.

That's all.

Well, what did you say?

I told him the truth.

That I had carried
him on my back

all those years in Detroit,

and I wasn't going
to do it anymore.

He had no one else to
blame for this but himself.

And if it hadn't been for
me, he would have ended up

like he did years
earlier, maybe worse.

A drunk, a bum,

a looser.

That's what I told him.

Marty was the reason
dad killed himself.

He broke his heart.

And the shirt?

So long as I had
my jacket buttoned up

no one could see the monogram.

I went to the party.

Afterward I,

I took a detour,

got rid of my shirt,

and went home to burn Marty's.

I see now in taking me in,

giving me a job,

making sure I was okay.

I thought he cared.

He should have kept
his mouth shut.

No more questions.

Get ready for it.

So what does it feel
like to be a free man, Joe?

Feels good, feels very good.

Tracy, tell us how you
feel now the trial's over

and Joe's free.

Well, of course it's
been a terrible strain,

but we're just happy that...

Excuse me!
Becky!

Becky, do you have
any words for us?

Anything, anything
about the trial?

Phil.

Mr. McBride, thank you so much.

Thank you.

Thank you both.

I mean, we can get them back.

You know, I have a
story to sell now

so we can get like interviews
and stuff and you'll be...

No, it's not like that, Joe.

If people want to hear me sing,

it's because I have talent.

Not because I'm some
celebrity of the week.

Let's go home.

It's crazy to think that Becky

would have let Joe go
to jail for her crime.

Hey, we did good today.

Yes we did.

Innocent man gets to go home.

Yeah.

Hi.
Hey.

Good job guys.
Thanks.

You're going to
run point on Becky?

Yes, thanks to you the
case is cut and dried.

One thing though,

all you had is Gina's word

that she found the
shirt in Becky's closet.

How did you know that
Becky was Marty's killer?

She was the only
one who cried for him.

You're good.

You're good, Mac.
