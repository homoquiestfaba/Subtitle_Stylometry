<i>Waking up in the light</i>

<i>Of a shiny new day</i>

<i>Giving thanks to the moon</i>

<i>For guiding my way</i>

<i>There is no better gift to the soul</i>

<i>So. great spirits</i>

<i>Hear my voice today</i>

<i>Welcome. magic</i>

<i>Welcome. sweet sunray</i>

<i>Love is no secret</i>

<i>Look all around you</i>

<i>Welcome to this day</i>

Whoa.
Look out! She´s after us!

You gotta help us!
You gotta hide us!

Too late. Here she comes!

l told you that was no moosette!
She looked like one from behind.

What´s gotten into you two?
Well, it´s that time of year.

Spring fever!
Spring what?

You know. The birds...
Yeah, and the bees.

And the moosettes. lf you know
what we mean by ´´moosettes.´´

Yeah, well, don´t look now
but your girlfriend´s back.

Jeez!

<i>Welcome. magic</i>

<i>Welcome. sweet sunray</i>

<i>Love is no secret</i>

<i>Look all around you</i>

<i>Welcome to this day</i>

Awesome! Let´s do it again!

Hey, Kenai!

Hiya, Tug!
Where y´all off to in such a hurry?

Crowberry Ridge.
We´re gonna get dibs.

There´s elderberries,
salmonberries, raspberries,

whortleberries, strawberries,
huckleberries, crowberries...

Hey, hey, hey, slow down now.
That´s a lot of berries.

Yeah, there´s plenty!
You wanna come with us?

Tug!

Well, l´d love to, Little Koda,
but can´t keep the girls waiting.

Aw, who needs girls?

We´re two footloose guys out on the tundra.

That´s right. Kenai and Koda.
We don´t need anybody else.

OK, but you can´t run from love.
Tug!

lt has a way of tracking you down.

Hi, Hoonah!
You look mighty lovely today.

Did you see the look on Tug´s face?
´´Can´t keep the girls waiting!´´

All right. How about we get some rest?
Rest?

We´ve been hibernating
for six months. Who needs rest?

Who needs rest? A couple of bears who´ll
beat the other bears to Crowberry Ridge.

We´ll get first dibs
on the berries, right?

Yeah, you bet.
lf you promise to go to sleep.

OK, OK, OK, OK.

l know all bears like berries,
but l love berries.

Good night, Koda.

Are you a berry-liker or berry-lover?
Good night, Koda.

Nita!
Kenai!

Yeah!

Race you to Hokani Falls!
Wait up!

Here l come!

Nita!

Here.

We´re always gonna be best friends.

Nita! Time to go!

Goodbye, Kenai.

See ya!

Bye, Nita.

Bye, Nita.

Bye, Nita...

So who´s Nita?

What?
Did you know you talk in your sleep?

You were going: ´´Nita! Nita!´´

So who´s Nita?
She´s a girl l used to know.

Whatever happened to her?
l don´t know.

l guess she grew up.

He´s here! He´s here!

The groom is here!
Hurry. Let us prepare.

Hurry up! l wanna see him.
l wanna see Atka.

Nita, he´s here!

They´re here!
Prepare for the ceremony.

He must have brought
his entire village with him.

Well, my sweet, this marriage
is extremely important.

That´s why we came
to help you get ready.

No, no. That´s OK.
l can get myself ready.

Go ahead.
Use all the water.

Then we´ll just air-dry your hair.
Air-dry? Certainly not.

Towel-dry is shinier.
You know...

We´ll put your hair up
to show off your beautiful eyes.

Up? No, down, of course,
to frame that beautiful face.

No. We´ll put it up
to show it off better.

Down.
Up.

l am going to say ´´down.´´

She´s nervous. She needs to eat.
l´ll get some smoked salmon.

Salmon? On a nervous stomach?

She needs hackberry root
steeped in rainwater.

ln the morning? No.
No, no, l´m fine.

l think l´ll feel better when l´m dressed.

Dressed?
l have just the outfit for you.

But you don´t understand.
l already have one picked out.

Simple reindeer hide -
slimming, yet elegant.

No, caribou.
Feathers. Lots of beads.

Beads? Are you nuts?
Reindeer for a wedding?

No beads.
Seashells!

What is it with you and your seashells?
l love seashells.

Hey!

l do believe l am feeling a bit hungry.
l´ll get the salmon.

l´ll get the tea!
OK! Get plenty of both.

You look as beautiful in that dress
as your mother did on our wedding day.

Thanks, Daddy.
l wanted to wear something of hers today.

That means so much to me.
Your mother would be so proud.

l wish she was here.
She is.

ln here.

Once you love someone,

they stay in your heart forever.

Are you ready to meet Atka?

Great spirits, we come before you today
to bond this man and this woman as one.

We pray this pleases you.

Nita!

The spirits are trying to tell us something.
lt must be a sign.

l don´t understand!
How could this happen?

The villagers say it´s a sign.

The villagers?
What the heck do they know?

Do you want the advice of the villagers
or a professional?

No, definitely a professional.

They say that in all the tribes,
you are the wisest shaman.

Sha-woman! OK?

´´Wise´´ and ´´man´´ don´t even belong
in the same sentence.

Let´s get down to business. So the ice
cracked right out from under you.

Sure you haven´t put on a few pounds?
Come on, girl to girl.

No. My weight´s been constant.
Well, lucky you, Miss Constant Weight.

Tell you what. Why don´t we
just ask the spirits, OK?

Yeah?
What are they saying?

Don´t interrupt!
lt ain´t all about you.

They say...

You can´t marry Ka-ka!

Atka.
Whatever! The point is...

you´re already matched up,
Miss Two-Timer.

Already matched up? To whom?
To the one who gave you this.

Look at that picture.
That thing is crystal-clear.

Kenai?
The bear boy?

No, no, no. We were just kids.
l´ve heard that one before.

There has to be a way to undo this.

Undo it?
You can´t undo what´s been done.

lt´s done. Case closed.
No more conversation.

There is one way.

You must go and eat an ox.

What?
Wait. l´m sorry.

lt´s the equinox.

Does this place mean anything to you?
Hokani Falls?

That´s where Kenai
gave me the amulet.

You gotta go to Hokani Falls.

And on the eve of the equinox,
when the spirits change winter into spring,

you must burn the amulet and
send the bond back up to the ancestors.

You know, you might wanna
write some of this down.

The equinox is only three days away!
l have to get going.

With the person who gave you
the amulet.

Kenai? But he´s a bear.

Yeah?
You know. A bear?

l know what a bear is,
and l suggest you go look in the woods.

Well, even if l find him,
how will l talk to him?

How will you talk to him?

Don´t be afraid.
lt´s in there.

That ain´t it.
Come on, try it again.

l don´t know what that was.
One more time.

And that mammoth stood there watching
the whole thing. So, l told Bucky,

´´The next time you have to sneeze, please
take the walnuts out of your mouth first.´´

Then l started laughing so hard,
guess what came out of my nose.

Koda, speaking of food...
l know what you mean.

All this walking
has made me crazy hungry.

Hey, watch it!

All right, step aside, kid. Let a real bear
show you how the digging´s done.

Sure it´s easy now!
l gave you a head start.

Jackpot!
All the roots you can eat, buddy.

l knew l was onto something.
Yeah, you did?

What can l say?
l´ve got killer instincts.

Yeah, right.

Hey, look. ls this a tuber?
Get down!

What is it?

Quick! Hide in here.

Nita?

Watch it! No, Nita!
lt´s me - Kenai.

Kenai?

ls it really you?
Yeah, it´s really me.

Wow!
l´d heard you were a bear,

l just didn´t realize
you´d look so much like a bear.

Yeah, well, look at you.
You really changed.

Wait a minute. You can talk.
l mean, you can understand me?

Yeah. The spirits did it,
so when l found you, l could talk to you.

Whoa. Wait a minute.
You´ve been looking for me? Why?

Well, this is why.

You´ve kept this?
After all these years.

The great spirits told our shaman
that this amulet bonds us as one.

Really?

So now you and l
have to go to Hokani Falls...

Like when we were kids?
...and burn it.

And burn it!
Burn it? What?

lt´s no big deal.
lt´s only a little trinket.

Little trinket?
Well, what l mean is,

we were just silly kids.

They won´t let me get married
until it´s destroyed.

Let me think about this.

Sorry, can´t help you.
What?

So, have fun burning
the ´´silly little trinket´´ on your own.

You don´t understand.
We have to burn it together.

Otherwise, it won´t work.
What won´t work?

Nita, this is my brother, Koda.
Koda, Nita. Nita, Koda.

So you´re Nita!
Kenai was just dreaming about you.

l was not.
Was too.

You should hear him. ´´Nita! Nita!´´

Well, it´s been nice talking to you,

but Koda and l have big plans
to go to Crowberry Ridge.

Wait! You´re just gonna walk away?
You´re not gonna help me take care of this?

Nope.

You know, neither of us can get on
with our lives until we burn this amulet.

l´ll take my chances.

OK. Fine. Fine.

l´ll just wait for them to turn you back
into a human and send you to find me.

Would they do that?
No, no, buddy, of course not.

Well, how do you know?

What if they did
turn you back into a man?

Then we wouldn´t be brothers anymore.

No, Koda, it´s...
That´s not...

Fine. OK. We´ll go to Hokani Falls.

But right after that, buddy, just the two
of us, we´ll race down to Crowberry Ridge.

Pinky swear?
Pinky swear.

Then it´s settled. Ready?

As l´ll ever be.

Hokani Falls is this way.

l knew that. l knew that.

No, he didn´t.
Kenai has a lousy sense of direction.

That is not true.
Once, in the middle of the night,

he was trying to find our cave in the dark...

Course, when we met, he didn´t know
the first thing about being a bear.

Like this one time,
we were hunting for pine nuts

and he stuck his big head
inside a hollow tree.

And l said, ´´You better not do that,
´cause you don´t know who lives there.´´

But he did,
´cause you can´t tell Kenai nothing.

All right, Koda.

Next thing you know, he spent
a whole week smelling like a stinky skunk.

Something tells me
stinky skunk was an improvement.

l got a lot more stinky Kenai stories
if you wanna hear ´em.

OK, so, like, we gotta go.
We´ll see ya around.

So, we´ll give you a call.
Yeah, we´ll catch you later.

Yeah, we gotta go work out.

Yeah. Gotta keep these muscles
real buff.

So long. Hey, look, it´s big bear.
Beauty.

Hey, guys.
Boy, are we glad to see you.

Yeah, yeah, ´cause we finally found
a couple of real moosettes.

Right down there by the stream.
Bye!

Toodle-oo!
So long!

Those guys are weird.

Don´t look.
You´ll only encourage them.

But they won´t give us the time of day.

So, what we was thinking is you could help
us with, you know, an opening line, like:

´´Hey, l see you like to eat twigs.´´

Or how about a sonnet? Like:
´´Shall l compare thee to a summer´s dew?´´

Gee. Forget that brainy stuff.
They´re not owls.

l like, ´´Hey, ladies. Nice dewlaps.
Are those things rea...?´´

Excuse me.

Gee. Hunter.
Hunter!

Run!
Bye! Every moose for himself.

Act like we´re not here.

lt´s OK. This is Nita.
She´s with me and Kenai.

She is?
Well, pleased to meet ya.

How´s it goin´?
l´m Rutt, this is my bro...

Kenai, what´s the holdup? We have to set
up camp on that far peak before sundown.

Nice to meet you.

Scary, isn´t she?
Let´s go. We´re running out of daylight.

Nita, calm down.
We got plenty of time.

A smart traveler
always allows for unexpected delays.

Well, this won´t be a delay
if you let me have a minute

to give these guys a little
romantic advice.

Romantic advice? From you?

Stop kidding. Let´s go!

You know, boys, l think this calls for
more than just a good opening line.

lt does?
Yeah, yeah, of course.

Acts of bravery -
that´s what really impresses the ladies.

Gee, bravery sounds scary.

No, no, you just have to
pretend to be brave.

Yeah?
l´ll go out there, l´ll act all ferocious,

and then you guys come over
the beaver dam and rescue them.

OK. Yeah, yeah.

That´s a beauty plan.
He´s smart. Not like you.

Get out.
Kenai! We don´t have time for this!

Kenai!
lt´s no use.

This falls under
´´You can´t tell Kenai nothing.´´

What´s wrong with him?
Maybe he got ahold of some bad salmon.

This is stupid.

This oughta impress the ladies for sure.
Yeah.

l´m a big hungry bear,

and l´m gonna rip you to shreds! Roar!

l said l´m gonna rip you to shreds!

l think that´s our cue.
Yeah. Beauty.

Let´s go.
Fear not, Moosettes!

l, Tuke, and my brother, Rutt,
will save you.

Yeah.
What ho, largish bear.

Touch not those fair moosette ladies.

You´ll have to go through us
if you want them.

Yeah! You´ll have to kill us.
What?

No, no, not kill us.
Sorry.

Maybe not kill us, but just, you know,
push us down or something.

Jeez, that was scary.
l thought l was gonna wet my hooves.

You can go back to grazing.
Nothing to see here.

Toodle-oo!
Hey, wait! Guys, where are you going?

Don´t leave!

This used to be such a quiet river.
Yes. Let´s get outta here.

Nice rack on that little one, though.
Are you kidding? All antler and no brain.

That went well.

Hey, Kenai! l thought you were supposed
to be scaring moose.

Do you think you can help me out here?

Do all his plans end
with his head stuck in something?

Most of them.

Koda!
Well, they do!

Calm down, Kenai.
We´ll try to get you outta here.

OK, let´s see here.

lt sure would be easier
if he didn´t have such a fat head.

Hi, Kenai.
Hi, Koda.

Oh, no! My bag!
My bag! The amulet´s in my bag.

lt´s floating right in front of you.
Just grab it.

Nita!

You get it. l can´t, l can´t.
lt´s right there! Kenai, get it.

l´m a little busy here.
lt´s getting away! Help! Get it!

Stop...

Oh, no!

The amulet!

There it is!

l guess this would qualify
as one of those unexpected delays.

There it is.

Thank goodness.

Let´s see what we got here.
We got...

Hey! Wait! That´s my stuff.

You leave that alone.
lt´s mine!

Come on!

lt´s gone. The amulet is gone!

That´s because there ain´t a better thief
than the masked bandit.

Once they get something in their clutches,
you might as well give up all hope.

Nope, that amulet´s as good as gone.
The ice age will end before you get it back.

Thanks a lot, Kenai.
What did l do?

This is all your fault!
My fault?

lf you hadn´t helped those moose...
Whoa!

You´re the one
who destroyed a beaver dam.

Well, l wouldn´t have
if you hadn´t gotten your head stuck in it.

And l´m not the one who had
the bag in reach and then let it float away.

My head was stuck.
What´s your excuse?

What am l gonna do now?

lf l can´t burn the amulet,
l´ll never be able to marry Atka.

Kenai?

Nita! Nita! You gotta come quick!
You´re not gonna believe it!

Kenai spent the whole night
untangling those tracks.

And l didn´t think anybody could,
´cause they were all forks,

double-backs, crisscrosses, dead ends...

Koda! Where is Kenai?

That´s what l´m trying to tell you.
He found the river bandit´s hideout.

Show me!

Nita! Nita! Over here!
Well, where is it? Did you get it?

l don´t have it yet.
lt´s up in the tree.

l´m waiting for them to...
fall asleep.

Nita, wait!
Hey!

Nita, what are you doing?
l´m getting my amulet back.

Let me handle this.
l´m fine. l´ve got it covered.

No, seriously, you could fall.

l´m trying to concentrate.

Can´t any of you morons
define the term ´´nocturnal´´? Anyone?

Sorry. Sorry.

lt´s completely my fault.
Just me.

Listen, you´ve got something of ours.

Yeah. lt´s round, about so big.

Maybe l do, maybe l don´t. That´s
for me to know and for you to find out.

lt´s a moot point. Finders keepers,
losers weepers. lt´s the way of the woods.

Hey, you didn´t find it, you stole it, thief.

All right. You got me.
That´s what we do.

We rob from the rich
and give to the less fortunate.

You know, like... us!

l don´t think
you wanna mess with Kenai.

He´s a lean, mean,
raccoon butt-kicking machine.

Go ahead, hit him with all you got.
He can take it.

Koda, what are you doing?

l´m tricking them into using
all their pine cones.

lt´s a pine - ow! - forest.

Right.

This could take a while.
You think?

Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!
What about a trade?

Whoa, whoa!
Hold your fire! Hold, hold, hold.

He wants to trade.

A trade.

What ya got?
What do l got? l got lots of things.

l got...

Pine cone?
No.

How about a stick?

A rock?
You are insulting me.

l can´t believe...
Shoo! Shoo! Come on.

Come on, let go.

Mama!

Hi.

Nita, l think it´s time to go.

Nita, behind you!

She´s not bad.

l got an idea. Come on.

Nita, go to the top.
What? l´m trying to get down.

Just listen to me.
l know what l´m doing.

Hello! l want what you took from me.

Yeah, that´s it. Keep going!

Let´s get her!

Kenai!

Well, well, well.
Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide.

Nita, let go!
What? This is your plan?

Just trust me.
Don´t listen to him.

Come on, come on.
Be a smart little hunter girl.

Hand over the trinket.

Kenai, this better work!

Catch me!

That was a lot of raccoons.
l can´t believe l outran all of them.

When you jumped outta that tree!
And when you caught me!

And when we fell...
You were amazing!

l´m just glad we finally
got the old Nita back.

What do you mean, ´´the old Nita´´?
The fun Nita.

Come on. You know you´ve been
kind of a stick-in-the-mud this entire trip.

OK, maybe you don´t know.

lt´s just good to see you
loosen up a bit, you know?

Now, hold on.

What stinks?

lt´s not me, Koda.

That´s the most disgusting thing
l´ve ever smelled.

Let´s go check it out.
Hey. Hey!

Wait a minute. l´m l´m not finished.

Oh, brother. l have never known
a moose to take this long.

Don´t rush me.
l can´t do it while you´re watching.

Jeez! You´re getting it on my leg.
Sorry.

Hey, largish bear.
How´s it goin´?

Are we glad to see you.
Yeah. Beauty.

We´re gettin´ the brush-off
from the moosettes.

Yeah, they seem immune
to our rugged good looks.

So we thought
we´d appeal to their olfactory senses.

Yes. For example, l´m wearing
essence of wet-leaf compost

with just a hint of sandalwood.

And l´m augmenting my natural moosely
musk with pine needles and river mud.

l got news for you, little brother -
that wasn´t mud.

Kind of overpowering?
Guys, don´t sweat it. l got another plan.

Yeah. l think we´ve all seen
your expertise on romance.

Yeah, very funny.
Don´t we have an amulet to burn?

We can spare a moment.

Beauty.
What you need here...

Excuse me.

...is a woman´s point of view.

Yeah?
And a plan that actually works.

That´s beauty.

Hi. l´m playing with my two best friends
and l need a place to hide.

Look at the sweet little thing.
Jeez, l could just eat him up.

Hello!

Go, go. Get moving.

Beauty.
Good luck.

Rutt, would you get going?
OK.

Excuse us, ladies.

We´re looking for our pal.

Brownish?
Why, yes.

Furry?
Yes again.

About yea big?
That´s him.

Haven´t seen him.

Here l am. Fooled you. l win.
There´s no beating you, little buddy.

Look at that.
You´re so good with him.

Yeah. We have lots
of little kid animal friends.

We know a little weasel
and a little badger.

And we´ve even got
some little baby bunny friends.

A smallish bear
is like a babe magnet.

Socialize.

So, would you ladies
be interested in grazing on some twigs?

No thanks. We just ate.

We love twigs.
Really? So do we. Right, little brother?

Shall l compare thee to a summer´s dew?
Jeez.

Though it aren´t more lovely
and more dewy than you.

Nice move.
What´s wrong with him?

Don´t mind my little brother.
He was trampled by an elk herd as a calf.

Jeez, that´s awful.
That´s not true. lt was only half a herd.

You´re serious, right?
Smooth!

Remind me again,
who´s the better moose matchmaker?

Beginner´s luck.
Jealous?

All right. That was really nice.
Guys, l did good. Did ya see me? l did it.

You do pretty amazing things with moose.
That´s great. Wonderful.

Hey! Wait for me.

Koda, be careful.
Relax. He´s fine.

He´s just looking for lunch.
Yeah. Besides, l´m always careful.

Hey, we´re making great time.

Look, see? We just go down this trail
until we hit the river.

River?
Yeah. Then we swim across.

Swim?
Then it´s just a little ways to Hokani Falls.

We´ll be there by lunchtime tomorrow.

Well, that´s a a good plan.
But what about this?

Up this ridge to that mountain,
climb those cliffs,

then we walk across that snow bridge
and avoid the river altogether.

That makes more sense to me.
That doesn´t make any sense.

That´s way out of the way, and
there´s too much up and not enough down.

l vote for the river.
Me too. Two to one. We win. Let´s eat.

Well, it´s my amulet.
So?

And my wedding.
Then have your honeymoon up there.

lf we go that way now, we´ll have to
walk all night to make it to the falls.

Fine. Then l´ll meet you there.
Nita, what´s wrong with you?

Trust me, my way
will get us there before...

What´s the matter with you?
You act like you´re afraid of fish.

Oh, my gosh, Kenai!
l can´t believe it.

Hey, Kenai, watch this.

Where´s the girl who´s afraid of fish?
Hi. My name is Nita and l´m afraid of fish.

The fish! The fish!
He´s so scary!

Oh, no, he´s gonna eat me!
Koda, come on. Koda, stop.

He´s almost got me.
Koda, stop!

We were just kidding around
about the fish.

No, it´s not the fish.

lt´s the water.

Ever since that day
l fell through the ice when we were kids.

l didn´t realize.

That´s why l didn´t grab the bag in the river.

lt wasn´t your fault we lost the amulet.

lt was mine.

Hey, we got it back together.
That´s all that matters, right?

What are you looking at?

Are you ready to keep going?
But l´ll never be able to cross that river.

We can do that together, too.

<i>Funny how it turns out</i>
<i>that everything can change</i>

lt´s the only way.

Let me help you.

l changed my mind.
Nope, it´s too late for that.

We´re going across.
Whatever happens, don´t let go.

OK.

<i>Now I realize</i>
<i>there´s so much more to learn</i>

<i>I´m ready for the world</i>.

Hey, smallish bear.
So where´s big bear?

With Nita.

He never has time for me anymore.
He´s too busy helping her.

Gee, boy, do l know how you feel.
My own brother gave me the heave-ho.

All for a babe.
Actually, two really, really hot babes.

Better watch your brother
doesn´t walk out on you.

He wouldn´t do that.
l said the same thing.

But get a load of
Moosanova over there.

Shall l compare thee
to a summer´s dew?

Did you just make that up?
Beauty. He´s such a poet.

Yeah, l guess l´ll see you around,
little bear.

You had a whole clumpful.
You´re making that up.

All l know is
l had all my fur when we went into the river,

then two handfuls were missing.

Well, maybe you´re just going bald.
What?

You know, it does look really thin
right through here.

Yeah, very funny.

This is the most fun l´ve had
since we were kids.

Fun, but cold.

On a night like this, it´s good to be a bear.
l bet.

So, Hokani Falls.

l guess we´ll make it there in time.
l guess.

A lot sure has changed
since the last time we were there.

No kidding.

Do you ever miss being human?

l mean,
have you ever thought about...

changing back?

Yeah, l´ve...
l´ve thought about it.

l knew it.

Koda.

You´re going back with her.
Koda, wait. Koda, wait!

Koda!

Koda, answer me!

Koda!

Hello?

Koda? Are you in here?

Where are you?

Koda?

Koda?
Go away.

Koda, Kenai´s worried sick about you.

Come on, l´ll take you to him.
No! l said go away.

Koda, please keep your voice down.
lt´s not safe.

l don´t care.
Just leave me alone.

Oh, no. Nita!

We´re gonna be all right,
but we´ve got to go.

Now!

Run! Run! Run! Faster!

We´re gonna make it!

Nita!
Take my hand.

Don´t move.

Koda!

Hang on!

Don´t let go!

Koda! Hold on!
Watch out!

Koda!

Koda, what would l have done
if anything happened to you?

You´re gonna leave me.

You said you missed being one of them.

You´re going back with her, aren´t you?

l do miss things, but you´re my brother.

l´ll never leave you.

Not ever.

This show´s
giving me the munchies.

Hey, little brother,
how about you get us some twigs?

OK.

Are you crying?
No. l mean, well, yeah.

But so what?
These lights are so beautiful. l...

He´s sensitive.

A moose with depth?
lt´s beauty.

What?
He´s a cute one, isn´t he?

Hey. l can be sensitive too.

l like your hooves.
Really?

Yeah, and l´m a hoof man.
Yours are nice and shiny.

Hoof man?
Why didn´t l think of that?

ls this the equinox?

Yeah, Koda. This is it.

My mom is up there somewhere.

My mom, too.

Do you miss yours?

Yes.

But you don´t need to wait for the lights
to find her, Koda.

She´s always with you.

ln here.

Once you love someone,

they stay in your heart forever.

lt´s time.

Koda, you be good, OK?

You´re such a sweet little cub.

The spell.

Goodbye.

Kenai, did you give Nita the amulet
because you loved her?

lt was a long time ago.
But she´s still with you, in here.

l can tell.

Koda, it doesn´t matter.

Well, if you do love her,
shouldn´t you tell her?

lt´s a little more complicated
than that.

Anyway, it´s over.

Hey, l promised you we´d be
the first two bears to Crowberry Ridge.

Pinky swear, remember?

How about first thing in the morning
we rustle up some more berries?

Sound good?

Mom, Kenai is so sad.

lt´s all because of me.

l´ll be OK on my own.

Tell the spirits to change Kenai back
so he can be happy.

Jeez, he´s really out.
Yeah.

Maybe we should
throw water on his face.

Just stand there drooling.
That should do it.

Trample off.
Wait. Hey, l think l saw him move.

Rise and shine, bear boy.
Yeah, not time to hydroplane yet.

lt´s hibernate, you hoofer.
That´s what l said.

We saw smallish bear last night.

We tried to stop him,
but he wouldn´t listen to us.

What? Where was he going?
To get Nita.

Said he´s gonna bring her back for you.
Bring her back?

No, no, no, no! lf he steps foot
in the village, the hunters will get him.

Aw, jeez!

Almost there.
And now for the final touch.

A beautiful bead necklace.
No, you don´t. Not this time.

This is much more appropriate.

That doesn´t match anything
she´s wearing.

And what makes you think
those beads do?

Nita, what would make you happy?

Once again, we are ready.

Are you, my daughter?

Yes, Father.

l would expect a bride
to be smiling on her wedding day.

ls there something wrong?

Daddy, l´m so confused.

l thought that when l burned the amulet
the bond would be broken, but...

in my heart, l...

l´m sorry, Daddy.

l can´t marry Atka.

Nita...

A bear!
There´s a bear in the village.

Koda?
Wait! Wait, don´t hurt him!

Oh, no! Our fish!

l got ´em!
We´ve got him now.

Look, he´s up in the tree!
There he is. Get him.

Don´t! Don´t! Please stop!

Run!

Here he comes!

Get your spears!
Come on.

Atka, no!

Leave him alone!

Get him!

Oh, no! Run!
Don´t let them get away!

After them!

Nita! Are you hurt?
l have to stop them.

There he is! Let´s get him!

Follow me!

Rock! Get out of the way!

Stay low.

Kenai!

There you are. Gotcha!

Nice move.

Beauty.

Our heroes.

Beauty.

Come on. We have to find Kenai.

Kenai!

No, don´t!

Kenai!

How could you?
What?

He was my friend.

Kenai?

l can´t...

l don´t understand.
l´m sorry.

l love you, too.

The spirits?

Kenai. l can understand you.

l asked the spirits to turn you
back into a man.

What?
So you could be with Nita.

No, Koda.
lt´s OK.

l just want you to be happy again.

Nita, l can´t.

But l can.

Am l the only one
that hears these bears speaking?

Yeah. That´s beauty.
How´s it going?

Father!

ls this what you want?

Will this make you happy?

You are my daughter,

and l will love you
no matter what you choose.

Nita?

How do l look?

Like a bear.
Except they gave you antlers.

What?
Gotcha!

<i>it´s truth that you hear</i>
