OKAY.

MM, THIS LOOKS GOOD.

THERE YOU GO, KITTY.

MM.

IT'S GOOD, HUH?

YEAH.

HEY HEY.

HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

OKAY, LET'S GO INSIDE.

OH, I KNOW.

* GO TO SLEEP,
LITTLE KITTY *

* GO TO SLEEP, LITTLE KITTY

* DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES *

* TILL THE SUN'S
IN THE SKY. *

WE'RE CLOSING NOW, ROGER. - CAN
I HAVE ONE FOR THE ROAD, THOUGH?

I DON'T THINK SO.
JUST-- JUST ONE MORE.

JUST FOR THE ROAD.
NO.

FOR THE ROAD.
JUST ONE FOR THE ROAD.

THERE'S THE FUCKIN' ROAD!

NOW GO.

OH GOD.

JESUS CHRIST.

<i>Welcome to the world of relaxation.</i>

<i>By following</i>
<i>my exercises</i>

<i>you will enhance</i>
<i>your ability to relax.</i>

<i>Now I want you</i>

<i>to touch your index finger</i>
<i>with your thumb.</i>

<i>This gesture</i>
<i>is to symbolize</i>

<i>the link between</i>
<i>the body and the mind.</i>

<i>Now close your eyes.</i>

<i>I want you to take</i>
<i>a deep breath.</i>

<i>And now slowly exhale.</i>

<i>You are entirely at peace</i>
<i>with your environment.</i>

<i>You feel calm.</i>

<i>You feel tranquil.</i>

<i>I want you to visualize</i>
<i>the scene I describe.</i>

<i>I want you to mentally</i>
<i>recreate every detail.</i>

<i>You are lying</i>
<i>on an endless white beach.</i>

<i>The sun is rising.</i>

<i>Feel the palm trees swaying--</i>

OOH OOH!

THERE YOU GO.

JUST DRINK YOUR MILK
IN ONE GO.

THAT SHOULD TAKE AWAY
THE HICCUPS.

AM I DEAD?
NO, YOU'RE LUCKY.

OH.

OKAY.OKAY.

OH, JACQUES, NOT AGAIN.
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST DIE?

GOOD TO SEE
YOU TOO, OLIVIA.

WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?
THIS IS NOT MY WARD.

I HAVE TOLD YOU 100 TIMES--

THIS IS A HOSPITAL,
NOT A ZOO.

WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN
STRICT HYGIENIC STANDARDS.

I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A FUCKIN'
WORD YOU'RE SAYING.

<i>CALL THE FUCKING</i>
<i>ORIENTAL EMBASSY</i>

AND MAKE THEM SEND OVER
AN INTERPRETER IMMEDIATELY.

YOU HAVE TO GET RID
OF THE DOG.

IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO STAY HERE
AT THE HOSPITAL.

HE'S GOT A NAME, YOU KNOW.
HIS NAME'S ROCOCO.

I DON'T CARE
WHAT'S HIS NAME.

HE'S GOT TO LEAVE.

GO BACK TO THE THIRD WORLD,
YOU CHINKY CORIANDER BITCH!

I HOPE YOU DROP DEAD.

DO ME A FAVOR--

UNPLUG THE SMOKE DETECTOR.

WHAT?

UNPLUG THE SMOKE DETECTOR.

<i>NOW THERE ARE TWO BOXES</i>
<i>ON THE LEFT ON THE WALL.</i>

THE LITTLE ONE ABOVE.
TWO DOORS-- OPEN THEM.

NOW UNPLUG THE GREEN WIRE.

<i>YES, THAT'S IT.</i>

SO WHAT THE FUCK
HAPPENED TO YOU?

SUICIDE... ATTEMPT.
NOT SUCCESSFUL.

JESUS.

EVERY SINGLE DAY
I'M FIGHTING

A BLOODY BATTLE
FOR MY LIFE.

AT THE SAME TIME, SOME MORON
IN THE PRIME OF HIS YOUTH

IS READY TO THROW HIS LIFE
STRAIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN.

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
HEART ATTACK NUMBER FIVE.

SO, LUCAS,

I HOPE THE HOSPITAL'S
BEEN TREATING YOU WELL.

<i>I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD</i>
<i>TO SEEING YOU TODAY.</i>

ALTHOUGH I MUST ADMIT
WE MAY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

SOME THINGS THAT
YOU MAY FIND UNPLEASANT.

I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY,
BUT I HAVE TO ASK IT.

WHY DID YOU TRY SUICIDE?

WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHEN IT COMES

TO SURVIVAL
OF THE FITTEST,

I JUST HAVE TO THROW IN
THE TOWEL, I GUESS.

<i>BUT YOU'RE NOT</i>
<i>AN ANIMAL, LUCAS.</i>

YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING.

YOU LIVE IN
A HIGHLY-DEVELOPED SOCIETY

THAT HAS ALL KINDS OF
BUFFERS AND SECURITY NETS

THAT ARE DESIGNED
TO BREAK YOUR FALL.

NO.I DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES
OF CIVILIZATION ANYMORE.

I AM OUTSIDE.
I AM AN ANIMAL.

TRY TO THINK OF LIFE
AS A COCONUT:

<i>IT'S HARD</i>
<i>ON THE OUTSIDE,</i>

AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE
PROPER TOOLS OR THE KNOW-HOW,

IT CAN SEEM TOTALLY
USELESS AND FUTILE.

BUT IF YOU KNOW HOW TO OPEN IT,
THERE'S SWEET JUICE INSIDE.

<i>BUT THE KEY IS NOT TO KEEP</i>
<i>THE COCONUT TO YOURSELF.</i>

ONCE YOU LEARN
HOW TO OPEN THE COCONUT,

YOU SHARE THE COCONUT WITH
SOMEONE WHO HAS NO COCONUT.

AND THEN YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPINESS IS.

SHARE THE COCONUT?
YES.

I AM VERY THANKFUL
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE
AND GIVEN ME

FOOD TO EAT
AND CLOTHES TO WEAR.

I WISH I COULD PAY YOU
BACK IN SOME WAY,

BUT I HAVE
NOTHING TO GIVE...

THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
...EXCEPT FOR MY SPERM.

I WOULD LIKE
TO DONATE MY SPERM.

NO NO.

I KNOW IT'S NOT MUCH,
BUT IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

IT'S AWFULLY KIND OF YOU,
BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

DOING YOU A PERSONAL FAVOR
THAT YOU HAVE TO REPAY.

THIS IS A HOSPITAL.
WE'RE JUST DOING OUR JOB.

WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
IS THAT YOU SURVIVED.

PLEASE, THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO.

WELL, IF YOU INSIST
ON DOING SOMETHING FOR US,

I COULD SIGN YOU UP
AS AN ORGAN DONOR.

THERE'S ALWAYS
A BIG NEED FOR ORGANS.

MY WHOLE BODY.

I AM READY TO DONATE MY BODY
AND MY SOUL TO SCIENCE.

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO START WITH?
A KIDNEY?

YOU JUST TAKE
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK.

THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

AND HERE'S A LITTLE
FAREWELL GIFT FROM THE STAFF

TO HELP MAKE YOUR
NEW START A GOOD ONE.

OH.

WHAT IS IT?
WHERE'S LUCAS?

YOU'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO USE
THIS BELL IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.

WHERE'S LUCAS?

WELL, I SUPPOSE LUCAS
IS FREE TO GO WHERE HE WANTS

WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION.

SON OF A MOTHER FUCKIN'
LESBIAN BITCH.

LUC?

WHAT UP, MAN?
HEY.

I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS.

BOY, YOU LOOK GOOD AS A
GOVERNMENT CHECK. HOW YOU BEEN?

UH, I'VE... I'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN A LITTLE ILL RECENTLY.

YOU'VE BEEN UNDER THE
WEATHER, HUH? - YEAH.

BUT YOU'RE BACK ON ALL FOURS NOW,
AIN'T YOU, CAT?

YEAH, DOING MUCH BETTER.
THANK YOU, POET.

I KNOW YOU'RE A STEPPER.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

TOUGH TITTY FOR A KITTY,
BUT THE MILK IS GOOD HOT.

BUT IT'S FAIR OUT HERE, MAN.
YEAH, I KNOW.

A LITTLE GRIND,
TRYING TO KEEP A FEW DOLLARS

OF THE LUNCH MONEY
IN THE POCKET.

I KNOW. ME TOO, POET.
IT JUST AIN'T EASY, BABE.

OH, HEY, I ACTUALLY FELL INTO
A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS RECENTLY.

HEY, AIN'T THAT A BLESSING?
MAYBE I COULD LEND YOU A FEW.

HEY, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER YOU CAN STAND, KID.

I APPRECIATE THIS, MAN.
THERE YOU GO.

SO EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT, HUH?

EXCUSE ME,
I WAS WONDERING

BY ANY CHANCE CAN YOU,
LIKE, GIVE A DOLLAR OR TWO?

YEAH, OF COURSE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

OF COURSE I CAN.
HERE.

MOST APPRECIATIVE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

OH, MAY I HAVE SOME,
PLEASE?

YES.
I'M HIS FRIEND.

NO NO, I KNOW.
HE'S MY FRIEND.

OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
THANK YOU.

THERE YOU GO.OKAY.
HOW ABOUT ME?

THAT'S FOR YOU.
THANKS.

AND THAT'S FOR YOU.

ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY.

WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?

THESE FILES ARE
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

NOW GET OUT.

LUCAS?

<i>LUCAS, YOU LITTLE PUNK.</i>

<i>YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.</i>
WHAT?

YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

I APPRECIATE IT,
JACQUES,

BUT I-- I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO BE LEFT ALONE.

COME WITH ME, LUCAS.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS,

YOU COULD DO WITH
SOME HELP YOURSELF.

OH SHIT.

<i>OKAY.</i>

BOMBS AWAY.

AH.

<i>HOUSE OF OYSTERS?</i>

WHY IS IT CALLED
HOUSE OF OYSTERS?

WELL, WHEN I BOUGHT
THE PLACE,

BACK IN THE DAYS,
IT WAS AN OLD OYSTER BAR

RUN BY THE LATE
MR. SAVIOLA.

<i>BUT AFTER A CUSTOMER</i>
<i>CONSUMED A LETHAL OYSTER,</i>

<i>MR. SAVIOLA WAS FORCED</i>
<i>TO CLOSE DOWN THE BUSINESS.</i>

BUT I KEPT THE NAME BECAUSE
IT'S THE NAME OF THE BAR,

AND A BAR SHOULD NOT
CHANGE ITS NAME,

NO MATTER WHAT GOES WRONG
IN THE WORLD.

COME HELL OR HIGH WATER,
WHEN THE SMOG DISSOLVES,

YOU GOTTA TRUST THAT YOUR BAR
IS STILL GONNA BE THERE.

<i>WE'RE READY.</i>
<i>SEND IT OVER.</i>

NICE TO MEET YOU.
LIKEWISE.

CHIN LEE
IS MY EXCELLENT COOK.

MONEYED SALE.
THANK YOU, CHIN LEE.

MY HEART'S NO GOOD.

I COULD PASS AWAY
ANY DAY NOW.

I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY,
NO FRIENDS,

AND I'M NOT EVEN INTERESTED
IN ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

WHAT I AM INTERESTED IN

IS THAT THIS BAR GOES ON
AFTER I'M GONE.

AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME
INTO THE PICTURE, LUCAS.

WHEN I'M GONE, I WANT YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

DON'T LIKE IT.

DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

YOU USED TO EAT
OUT OF GARBAGE CANS.

BUT WHEN PRESENTED WITH THE HEIGHTS
OF GASTRONOMY, YOU REFUSE IT?

SORRY.

YOU HAVE MANY THINGS
TO LEARN, MY FRIEND.

AND I'M NOT
GONNA GIVE UP

UNTIL I'VE TAUGHT
YOU EVERYTHING.

FROM NOW ON,
YOU'RE MY STUDENT.

THIS IS WHERE I LIVE.

AND THIS IS WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA LIVE.

OH, THANK YOU.
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

HERE'S SOME PAJAMAS.

<i>TOMORROW'S GONNA</i>
<i>BE A BUSY DAY.</i>

OPEN UP!

WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU MORONS?

WHY IS THE BAR
CLOSED, JACQUES?

I'M TRAINING A NEW EMPLOYEE.
HOW LONG IS THAT GONNA TAKE?

I DON'T KNOW.
COME ON.

GIVE US AN IDEA.
A DAY, A YEAR, OR WHAT?

FOR GOD'S SAKE, STOP WHINING
AND GO BACK TO YOUR MOTHERS.

BUT I WANNA GET A DRINK.
MY MOTHER'S DEAD. YOU KNOW THAT.

<i>COME ON, JACQUES.</i>

JACQUES!

WELL, LONG SEE
NO TIME.

AH.

<i>HOW YOU DOING?</i>
<i>HOW'S THE OLD HEART?</i>

TERRIBLE AS USUAL,
DIMITRI.

I HAVEN'T FUCKED SINCE LAST CENTURY.
OH, NO.

THE CLOSEST I'VE COME
TO SEXUAL ACTIVITY

IS BRUSHING MY TEETH.

OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE,
JACQUES.

BUT YOU STILL MANAGE
TO GET A BONER?

HARDLY.
OH, I'M SO SORRY, JACQUES.

IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU,
MY FRIEND?

WHERE IS YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE?

SARAH!
<i>YES?</i>

JACQUES WANTS TO
SAY HELLO TO YOU.

<i>OKAY, COMING.</i>

OH, SARAH!
SARAH, SARAH, SARAH!

HI, JACQUES.

<i>OH MY GOD,</i>
<i>YOU SMELL SO GOOD.</i>

THANK YOU, JACQUES.
OH GOD, YOU SMELL GOOD.MM!

<i>OKAY, JACQUES.</i>
<i>IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, SARAH.</i>

JACQUES.
<i>OKAY, IT'S ENOUGH.</i>

HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?
JACQUES!

WHAT?
TAKE IT EASY.

GOOD TO SEE YOU, JACQUES.
WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU, SARAH.

<i>COME BACK SOON.</i>
<i>VERY VERY SOON.</i>

WHERE WERE WE?
I DON'T KNOW, JACQUES.

WHY'D YOU COME?
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? - <i>OH YEAH.</i>

YOU SEE THIS
YOUNG GENTLEMAN?

I PULLED HIM
OUT OF THE GUTTER.

WE NEED TO GET HIM
PENGUINIZED.

JEEZ, WE'VE GOT
WORK TO DO.

WELL, BRING IT ON, YOU FUCKING
COMMUNIST. WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.

TAKE IT EASY, JACQUES.
WHAT?

I MEAN, YOU BURST INTO MY STORE,
YOU HARASS MY WIFE,

AND NOW YOU START
CRITICIZING MY PAST AS WELL?

I'M NOT CRITICIZING YOU,
DIMITRI.

IT WAS A JOKE.
JEEZ.

I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SO SENSITIVE
ABOUT YOUR COMMUNISTIC PAST.

CAN I CALL YOU
A CAPITALISTIC SWINE?

WOULD THAT WORK
FOR YOU, DIMITRI? JEEZ.

WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

YOU GOT HEMORRHOIDS
OR SOMETHING?

THESE ARE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES

I HAVE EVER SEEN
IN MY LIFE, JACQUES,

BUT THEY ARE SO STIFF.
JESUS.

- <i>NO
ARTY-FARTY FASHION BULLSHIT.</i>

JUST A DECENT HAIRCUT.
CRAFTSMANSHIP, HONESTY--
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

LIKE THE OLD DAYS.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

YOU ARE IN
THE RIGHT PLACE, JACQUES.

I DON'T TRUST YOU.

OH, HERE.

WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF
WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW

IN CASE YOU NEED
SOME INSPIRATION.

HEY HEY HEY HEY.

I SAID NO FASHION CRAP.

HAS IT OCCURRED TO YOU
THAT THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN

MIGHT HAVE AN OPINION
OF HIS OWN?

NO.IT IS I WHO'LL PAY
FOR THE OPERATION

AND IT IS I
WHO'LL CONDUCT IT.

SO PLEASE STOP
GETTING ON MY NERVES

AND JUST DO YOUR JOB.

MY JOB?

HOW DARE YOU?
FAGGOT.

OH-- OH DEAR, HAVE I--
HAVE I NICKED YOU?

OH NO, BLOOD.

I'M GONNA SUE YOUR FLAMING
WRINKLED HOMOSEXUAL ASS OFF,

YOU FUCKING MORON.

THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

JESUS, JACQUES,
I FEEL STRANGE ABOUT THIS.

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

DON'T YOU TRUST ME?
I DON'T KNOW.

IT'S-- IT'S LIKE PEOPLE TAKE
AN EDUCATION TO LEARN THIS.

YOU KNOW, FIVE YEARS OR SOMETHING.
WHERE YOU BEEN?

IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE TALKING
ROCKET SCIENCE, YOU KNOW.

IT'S A KNIFE-- THE OLDEST
TOOL KNOWN TO MAN.

OKAY.

JUST BE CAREFUL.
TRUST ME.

OH NO...

BLOOD.

OKAY OKAY, LISTEN UP,
GENTLEMEN.

I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE LUCAS.

HOW YOU DOING, LUCAS?
HI, LUCAS.

<i>YOU ACT LIKE A WOMAN, THOUGH.</i>

<i>BECAUSE THIS IS</i>
<i>FEMALE BEHAVIOR.</i>

WOMEN, WHEN THEY HEAR THAT MEN LIVE
WITH THEIR MOMMIES, IT'S NOT SO SEXY.

<i>BELIEVE ME, I DON'T TELL THEM--</i>
<i>YOU'RE VERY PASSIVE.</i>

<i>I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE</i>
<i>MORE PASSIVE THAN YOU.</i>

<i>WELL, THE TIMES THAT IT'S
WORKED FOR ME IS WHEN--</i>

<i>WHEN WAS THE LAST
TIME YOU WERE ON A DATE?</i>

I CAN'T REMEMBER.

BUT, LIKE, IF I'M GOING OUT
OR IF I'M GOING TO A MOVIE,

LIKE I GOTTA GO TO A MOVIE UPTOWN,
I'LL TAKE THE TRAIN.

OH MY GOD, WE'VE GOT A WALK-IN.
WE'VE GOT A WALK-IN.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I'LL HAVE A BLOODY MARY, PLEASE.

AND DO YOU HAVE
ORGANIC TOMATO JUICE?

SORRY, WE'RE OUT OF CELERY.

BUT THEN IF YOU
ARE GOING UPTOWN,

YOU ARE TAKING WHAT?
LUCAS.

WE DON'T DO WALK-INS.

WHAT?

<i>EAGER.</i>
EAGER BEAVER.

LUCAS.

NEVER REMOVE
AN EMPTY GLASS.

IT IS THE CUSTOMER'S
HISTORY,

THE TRACK RECORD
OF HIS STATE OF MIND--

AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION

WHICH SHOULD NOT
BE FIXED NOR FALSIFIED.

HEY, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

<i>OVERVIEW OVERVIEW OVERVIEW.</i>

<i>YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING</i>
<i>ON WITH EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER.</i>

<i>WHO'S DRINKING WHAT?</i>
<i>WHO NEEDS A REFILL?</i>

<i>WHO WANTS TO BE LEFT ALONE?</i>

<i>EACH REGULAR HAS</i>
<i>THEIR OWN ROUTINE</i>

<i>WHICH YOU HAVE</i>
<i>TO LEARN BY HEART.</i>

<i>A DECENT BARTENDER KNOWS</i>
<i>WHAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS</i>

<i>BEFORE HE KNOWS IT HIMSELF.</i>

AT THE END OF THE DAY,

YOU TAKE
THE DAY'S EARNINGS

AND YOU PUT IT
RIGHT IN HERE.

<i>INTO THE FREEZER?</i>
INTO THE FREEZER.

I'VE BEEN BURGLARIZED
TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION.

AND I AIN'T LOST
A SINGLE DIME--

NOT SINCE I STARTED
FREEZING MY MONEY.

THIS IS ENRIQUE.

HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

<i>IN FACT,</i>
<i>MY ONLY FRIEND.</i>

<i>HE LIVES IN MARTINIQUE</i>
<i>WHERE HE GROWS</i>

AND HANDPICKS
MY COFFEE BEANS.

WONDERFUL PERSON.

AND THIS IS HIS MOTHER,
JOSEPHINE.

IF I WASN'T
IN SUCH BAD SHAPE,

I'D GO STRAIGHT
TO MARTINIQUE AND MARRY HER.

WHO'S THE LITTLE GIRL?

AH.

THAT IS ENRIQUE'S BEAUTIFUL
NINE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, FELICIA.

I WANT YOU TO MARRY HER.

WHEN SHE'S
A LITTLE BIT OLDER.

<i>FOR OVER 15
YEARS HE'S DROPPED BY</i>

EVERY SINGLE DAY
FOR ONE CUP OF ESPRESSO.

<i>HE NEVER SAYS GOOD MORNING,</i>
<i>NEVER SAYS WHAT HE WANTS.</i>

<i>NOBODY EVEN KNOWS HIS NAME.</i>

BUT AS SOON
AS HE ARRIVES,

HE EXPECTS YOU TO BRING
THAT ESPRESSO.

<i>HE'LL DRINK IT</i>
<i>IN THREE SIPS</i>

<i>IN TOTAL SILENCE.</i>

AND HE ALWAYS LEAVES
THE SAME TIP.

SOOTY, THIS ISN'T
YOUR USUAL

CHIMNEY SWEEPING
UNIFORM, IS IT?

NAH, 'CAUSE SOOTY IS NOT
A CHIMNEY SWEEPER.

SOOTY IS A "CHIMNIST."

AND I AM LOOKING
PARTICULARLY DELICIOUS TODAY

BECAUSE I WAS OFFICIATING
AT A WEDDING.

NOW DID YOU KNOW THAT
IT IS LUCKY FOR A BRIDE

TO BE KISSED ON BOTH
CHEEKS BY A CHIMNIST?

YEAH.SO WHAT LUCK DOES
THE TRASHMAN BRING?

I AM A SANITATION ENGINEER

<i>WHO ONE DAY WILL BE THE FIRST</i>
<i>GARBAGE MAN TO GO OUT INTO SPACE.</i>

WE GOT TO GET RID OF SOME OF
THIS TRASH THAT'S AROUND HERE.

THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU'RE GONNA BE A "TRASHTRONAUT."

EXACTLY.
SO WHAT?

YOU STUFF YOURSELF
INSIDE THE RUBBISH BIN

AND, SHHH, SHOOT UP INTO THE
STRATOSPHERE? - <i>IT'LL HAPPEN.</i>

YEAH, I READ ABOUT IT.
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN ANY DAY NOW.

THERE'S A LOT OF RUBBISH IN THE
FLOWER BUSINESS, ISN'T THERE, RODDIE?

I HATE FLOWERS.
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT FLOWERS.

<i>TOUCHY TOUCHY.</i>
WHY?

MOMMY'S-- MOMMY'S
UPSETTING YOU?

<i>SAY HI TO MOMMY</i>
<i>FOR ME, WILL YOU?</i>

I FORGET.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW?

THERE'S, LIKE,
A TECHNICAL TERM FOR IT.

IT'S, UM...
IT'S WHORE.

OOH!
OOH!

I AM NOT
A FUCKING WHORE.

I'M A STIMULATOR.

TIME TO WAKE UP.

JACQUES, PLEASE.
<i>TODAY'S A BIG DAY.</i>

TODAY'S THE DAY I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE COFFEE.

MAKE COFFEE?
<i>YEAH.</i>

I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG
ABOUT MY PERSON,

BUT I THINK THAT MAKING COFFEE
IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW SKILLS

THAT I ALREADY MASTERED.

YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
AND DUTY IS TO TRANSFER

THE FULL RANGE
OF FLAVOR AND AROMA

OF ENRIQUE'S BEANS
TO THE CUP.

ANYTHING LESS
WILL BE A DISGRACE

TO THE CUSTOMERS,
MY BAR, AND ENRIQUE.

IN ORDER TO SUCCEED,

YOU MUST MASTER
A FEW TECHNICAL SKILLS.

THE FIRST INSTRUMENT
IS THE GRINDER.

NOW COFFEE CAN BE
GROUND IN MANY WAYS,

BUT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE
THE RIGHT WAY--

NEITHER TOO FINE
NOR TOO GRAINY.

WHEN THE WATER
IS A LITTLE OVER 90°

AND ALMOST BOILING,
IT IS FORCED THROUGH THE COFFEE

AT A PRESSURE
OF NINE ATMOSPHERES.

AND THIS SHOULD TAKE
EXACTLY 24 SECONDS.

IF IT TAKES MORE THAN 24 SECONDS,
THE COFFEE IS TOO FINE.

IF IT TAKES LESS THAN 24 SECONDS,
THE COFFEE IS TOO GRAINY.

YOU CAN PRACTICE
USING THIS STOPWATCH.

BUT IN TIME YOU WILL COME
TO LEARN BY HEART

THE DURATION
OF THE MAGIC 24 SECONDS.

WHY DON'T YOU EVEN TASTE THEM?

IT WOULD BE AN OFFENSE
TO MY TASTE BUDS.

YOU JUST DON'T EXPOSE THEM
TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

WELL, I CAN'T SEE
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.

IT'S BLACK, IT'S HOT--
IT'S DISGUSTING.

THIS IS BUTRAGUEÑO...

<i>...THE FAMOUS BULL.</i>

<i>BUENOS DIAS,</i> BUTRAGUEÑO,
YOU CRAZY CATHOLIC FUCK.

LUCKY BASTARD--

FUCKING THOSE BEAUTIFUL
COWS ALL DAY LONG.

WHY THE FUCK
DID YOU BUY A DUCK?

<i>IT'S OUR CHRISTMAS</i>
<i>DINNER, LUCAS.</i>

WE'RE GOING TO FEED IT
WITH ORANGES AND GINGER

AND FRESH ESTRAGON
AND COGNAC.

WE'RE GONNA MARINATE IT
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

WE CAN'T KILL A FELLOW DUCK.
<i>YES, WE CAN, LUCAS.</i>

MY MOUTH'S WATERING
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

<i>WHAT THE FUCK'S</i>
<i>GOING ON HERE?</i>

OKAY, YOU LET ME KNOW
HOW THIS ONE IS.

HERE YOU ARE.
THANK YOU.

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A SHAME

TO LET ALL THOSE
ESPRESSOS GO TO WASTE

WHILE I MASTER
THE TECHNIQUE,

SO I THOUGHT
WE COULD TAKE IT

AS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO HELP PEOPLE.

HELP PEOPLE?
YES, HELP PEOPLE.

ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

WE'RE RUNNING A BUSINESS HERE,
NOT A GODDAMN SHELTER.

<i>NOW GET THESE LOSERS</i>
<i>OUT OF MY SIGHT!</i>

FINISH YOUR--
JACQUES...

AREN'T YOU SOMETIMES AFRAID
THAT YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL?

CHRISTOPHER, YOU CAN FINISH
YOUR COFFEE. IT'S FINE.

GO!

IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
THANK YOU.

WHAT ARE WE GONNA
CALL YOU?

ESTRAGON?

OKAY.

ESTRAGON.

BAR'S CLOSED.
GET THE FUCK OUT.

WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
THE OWNER OF THIS BUILDING.

CORRECT.

WE'RE BUYING BUILDINGS
IN THIS AREA

AND WE'RE INTERESTED IN LOOKING
INTO BUYING THIS ONE TOO.

WELL, FOR A BILLION DOLLARS

I'LL GIVE YOU A SCENIC TOUR
OF MY ANAL CANAL.

HOW DO YOU LIKE
THEM APPLES?

IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO SIT DOWN FOR A WHILE--

GODDAMN, YOU'RE LIKE A PIECE
OF SHIT THAT JUST WON'T FLUSH.

NOW GET THE FUCK OUT OF
HERE BEFORE I GET RUDE.

LET'S GO, GUYS.

"A WALK IN THE MISTS
OF TIME AND SPACE."

WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S THE TITLE OF MY BOOK.

I LIKE IT.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THAT.

YEAH, WELL, I'M STUCK THOUGH.
I'M BLOCKED.

COME ON, YOU GOT IT
IN YOUR BLOOD.

YOU'RE JULES VERNE'S
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDSON.

YEAH, BUT THINK OF THE PRESSURE.
FORGET ABOUT IT.

YOU COULD DO IT.
YOU GOT IT IN YOUR BLOOD.

JUST WRITE IT.
OKAY.

SHE GAVE ME HER NUMBER,
BUT AS SHE WAS WRITING IT OUT,

SHE GOES, "DON'T CALL ME
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS."

AND I SAID, "HOW COME?"
SHE SAID, "WELL, I'M GONNA--"

AH, I CAN'T
TAKE THIS ANYMORE!

WE ARE ALL ANIMALS.

ESTRAGON, YOU MUST
BE LIBERATED.

<i>TAKE IT EASY.</i>
<i>COME ON, DARLING.</i>

OUT OUT.

COME ON, OUT,
SWEETHEART.

<i>ESTRAGON, MY FRIEND,</i>
<i>YOU MUST BE LIBERATED.</i>

<i>I'M OFFERING YOU FREEDOM</i>

<i>AND YOU GO BACK</i>
<i>INTO INCARCERATION.</i>

PHIL.

THIS ONE, RIGHT?
YEAH, MM-HMM.

LISTEN, LUCAS, I DIDN'T
BRING TOO MUCH CASH WITH ME.

CAN I BRING IT IN
TO YOU TOMORROW?

I HAVE A TIP
I CAN LEAVE YA.

YOU THINK IT'LL BE OKAY?
YEAH, SURE.

THANKS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

HOW'S-- HOW'S
YOUR MOTHER DOING?

SHE'S DYING.

SHE MIGHT BE
ABLE TO COME HOME

FROM THE HOSPITAL
A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK,

BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

HERE'S TO MOOTY.

MOOTY.
HERE'S TO MOOTY.

MY BOY, YOU'RE MAKING
ONE VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE.

WHAT?
YOU'RE BEING FRIENDLY.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
REMEMBER WHAT I SAY:

NEVER BE FRIENDLY
WITH A CUSTOMER.

BE FAMILIAR,
BUT NOT FRIENDLY.

FAMILIAR BUT NOT FRIENDLY.

WHAT'S WRONG
WITH FRIENDLY?

SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU
LEAST EXPECT IT,

FRIENDSHIP WILL STAB YOU
IN THE BACK LIKE A DAGGER.

THE CUSTOMER WILL START TRUSTING
YOU, YOU'LL START TRUSTING THEM.

ONE THING WILL LEAD
TO ANOTHER

AND YOU DON'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN.

CAN I GET ONE
FOR THE ROAD?

NO, SORRY, ROGER.
WE'RE CLOSED.

WAIT, JUST ONE FOR THE ROAD.
COME ON.

I THINK YOU'VE HAD
SEVEN FOR THE ROAD.

THIS ONE IS FOR THE ROAD.
WE'RE CLOSED.

DAMN IT.

OH, WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO HUMANITY THESE DAYS?

FUCK.

YOU'RE DOING
ALL RIGHT, LUCAS,

BUT YOU STILL GOT
A LOT TO LEARN.

WE GOTTA WORK
ON YOUR ATTITUDE.

I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
A NATURAL WHEN IT COMES

TO HOSTILITY AND ARROGANCE.

BUT YOU KNOW,
GIVEN TIME IT'LL COME.

IT'S AMAZING

HOW BROCCOLI ALWAYS
MAKES YOU FART.

IN A WAY, BROCCOLI
IS THE EMBODIMENT OF FART.

IF YOU COULD CAPTURE
A PIECE OF FART,

MATERIALIZE IT,

I IMAGINE IT WOULD LOOK
PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS.

THE INCARNATION OF FART.

LUCAS, MY BOY...

YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

HI.

THE BAR IS CLOSED.

OH...

HEY, DON'T CRY.

DON'T CRY.

UH, EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.

HERE, HAVE A SEAT.

LET ME GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?
CHAMPAGNE.

CHAMPAGNE?
<i>YES, PLEASE.</i>

HERE.
THANK YOU.

MM.

ARE YOU A STEWARDESS?
NO.

OH.

I JUST THOUGHT BECAUSE
OF THE OUTFIT...

I GOT FIRED.
WHY?

BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID.

AFRAID OF WHAT?

I WAS AFRAID OF FLYING.

WELL, IT'S NOT
IN OUR NATURE TO FLY.

SO I DON'T BLAME YOU.

YOU ARE VERY KIND.

CAN I STAY
WITH YOU TONIGHT?

YOU MEAN LIKE--

I HAVE NO PLACE TO SLEEP
AND I'M VERY TIRED.

UM...

I'M AFRAID THAT'S
MAYBE NOT THE BEST IDEA.

OH, NO NO.

PLEASE, I AM SORRY.
I AM SORRY.

<i>DON'T CRY.</i>

BUT WE HAVE TO BE
VERY QUIET

AND VERY VERY
CAREFUL.

WHERE ARE WE GOING?
I LIVE HERE.

WOW.

MY BOSS
LIVES HERE TOO

AND HE'S NOT
THE KIND OF PERSON

YOU'D LIKE TO WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

I UNDERSTAND.

I'M SORRY.

<i>You will be at peace with yourself</i>

<i>and the people</i>
<i>around you.</i>

<i>I am going to wake you up</i>
<i>at the count of five.</i>

<i>One--</i>

<i>you feel yourself</i>
<i>awakening now,</i>

<i>filled with energy</i>
<i>and self-assurance.</i>

<i>Two-- you are</i>
<i>feeling good</i>

<i>and glad to be alive.</i>

<i>Three-- you are</i>
<i>awakening now, feeling...</i>

GOOD MORNING, JACQUES.
THIS IS APRIL.

SHE HAD NO PLACE TO STAY
AND NO MONEY, SO--

I WANT THAT WHORE
OUT OF MY HOUSE IMMEDIATELY

AND I NEVER WANT
TO SEE HER AGAIN.

DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE
JUST CALLED ME? - YES.

CHAMPAGNE IS NOT FOR
WETTING PUSSIES, YOU KNOW.

IT'S FOR CELEBRATING
MAJOR VICTORIES IN SPORTS.

LISTEN TO ME.

THERE ARE TWO WORLDS--

THE WORLD OF MAN
AND THE WORLD OF THE BITCH.

A BAR IS NO PLACE
FOR A WOMAN.

THEY HAVE THE CAFETERIAS
AND THE PATISSERIES.

THE BAR IS OUR SPACE.

IT'S A SANCTUARY WHERE MAN
CAN COME AND BE FREE

KNOWING THAT HE'S
PERFECTLY PROTECTED

FROM ANY INTERFERENCE
OF THE FEMININE.

BUT SHE'S GOT NO MONEY
AND NO PLACE TO STAY.

WELL, THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM
AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T MINE.

WE CAN'T JUST THROW HER OUT ON THE
STREET LIKE GARBAGE. - YES, WE CAN.

DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE?

OH, JESUS CHRIST, LUCAS.
DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

I AM JUST TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL!

WE GOT EVERYTHING.
SHE'S GOT NOTHING.

WE CAN HELP HER.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

24 HOURS.

<i>YOU'VE GOT 24 HOURS</i>
<i>TO GET RID OF THE BITCH.</i>

SO HOW ARE YOU
FEELING THESE DAYS?

DOUBT, FEAR,

PAIN, ANXIETY,

DISTRACTION,
NERVOUSNESS,

HORROR, FRIGHT,
PANIC, DREAD,

TERROR, TREPIDATION.

I FEEL LIKE
A GODDAMN THESAURUS.

COME ON, ESTRAGON,
EAT THOSE HERBS.

THEY'RE GOOD FOR YOU.

LOOKS GOOD.

WHERE IS YOUR LADY ROOM?

NO LADY ROOM.

ESTRAGON?

WHERE'S ESTRAGON?

<i>ESTRAGON!</i>

COME ON.
SHH.

<i>I LOVE FLOWERS.</i> - Roddie: <i>YEAH?
YOU SHOULD COME BY SOMETIME.</i>

<i>YES.</i>
<i>YEAH.</i>

YOU NEED A LIGHTER?

IT APPEARS OUR BOY RODDIE
IS HAVING A HARD TIME

GETTING HIS FLAME UP.

WOMEN CAN SEEM CUTE
AND CHARMING ON THE SURFACE.

BUT UNDERNEATH THEY'RE
THE SAME UNIVERSAL BITCH.

YEAH, FUCK YOU.
YOU LITTLE SISSY-BOY, HUH?

FUCK YOU! YOU COME AND YOU WHINE!
WHOA WHOA WHOA.

<i>COME ON, FLOWER BOY!</i>
<i>DAMN IT, YOU FUCKING WHORE.</i>

I'M NOT A WHORE!
I'M A STIMULATOR!

LUCAS.

<i>COME OVER HERE</i>
<i>FOR A SECOND.</i>

I'VE GOT A THERAPY
CLASS AT 9:30.

AND WHEN I GET BACK,
SHE'S HISTORY, OKAY?

<i>APRIL.</i>
YES?

I WAS THINKING
IT'S BEEN NICE

HAVING YOU
AND EVERYTHING.

OH, THANK YOU.

I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE.

IS THAT ALL
YOU WANTED TO SAY?

YES.

I GUESS SO.

BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE

YOU WANT TO
TELL ME SOMETHING--

SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

HERE.

TAKE THIS MONEY.

<i>IT'S A BIT FROZEN</i>
<i>AT THE MOMENT.</i>

BUT WHEN IT MELTS,
IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO GET YOU BACK.

I'M SORRY.

<i>TAKE A NICE DEEP BREATH</i>

<i>AND GO TO THE CENTER</i>
<i>AND LET IT OUT.</i>

WHOOOA!

THEN GO BACK. OOH.

* HA HA HO HO HO

* HA HA HO HO HO

* HA HA HO HO HO,
HA HA HO HO HO *

* HA HA HO HO HO,
HA HA HO HO HO... *

BAD GUY.

LET'S GET MARRIED.

MARRIED?
<i>YES.</i>

BUT WOULDN'T WE BE MOVING
A LITTLE BIT FAST?

YES.

PLEASE, LUCAS,
DON'T SEND ME BACK.

PLEASE PLEASE.

THIS IS A BIG RELIEF
FOR ME, LUCAS.

<i>YOU KNOW, THE BITCH EPISODE</i>
<i>WAS NOT SUCH A BAD THING.</i>

<i>IT MADE</i>
<i>THE ALARM BELLS RING</i>

AND IT ALLOWS US
TO BE MORE ALERT FROM...

WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

<i>DID SOMEBODY</i>
<i>WIN SOMETHING?</i>

DID I MISS SOMETHING
IN THE WORLD OF SPORTS?

WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON, LUCAS?

I'M GETTING MARRIED.

LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT:

<i>I ASK YOU TO</i>
<i>KICK OUT THE BITCH</i>

<i>AND I LEAVE YOU ALONE</i>
<i>FOR SIX QUARTERS OF AN HOUR.</i>

AND WHEN I GET BACK,

YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
TO THE BITCH?

WOULD THAT BE A FAIRLY ACCURATE
ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS?

I GUESS SO.

<i>DO I HAVE TO WATCH</i>
<i>YOUR EVERY FUCKING STEP?</i>

THIS IS MY WORSE NIGHTMARE
COME TRUE.FUCK!

<i>I SHOULD'VE BEEN MORE CAREFUL.</i>
<i>I SHOULD'VE PREVENTED THIS.</i>

<i>JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!</i>

WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
STICK TO OUR PLAN?

WHAT PLAN?

WHAT'S WRONG WITH
ENRIQUE'S DAUGHTER?

THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH HER.

WHAT DOES SHE HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

YOU WERE GONNA MARRY HER.

YOU'RE CRAZY.

SHE'S NINE YEARS OLD.
I NEVER SAID THAT.

WE MADE A DEAL,
YOU UNGRATEFUL SON OF A BITCH.

I PUT ALL MY BETS
ON YOU, LUCAS.

<i>JESUS, MY WORLD</i>
<i>IS FALLING APART.</i>

YOU'RE CRAZY.

I WORK LIKE A SLEDGEHAMMER
IN HELL FOR YOUR FUCKING BAR.

YOU KEEP ME HERE
LIKE A PRISONER.

<i>IF SHE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS</i>
<i>PLACE, THEN I'M OUT OF HERE TOO.</i>

YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
<i>YES, I CAN.</i>

NO, YOU CAN'T.
YES, I CAN.

JUST TAKE A LOOK,
JACQUES.

I'LL GET IT FRESH.

YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

PSST.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JACQUES!

WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

I DON'T DO BIRTHDAYS.
WE BAKED THE CAKE FOR YOU.

<i>I DON'T GIVE A FUCK</i>
<i>WHAT YOU BAKED.</i>

YOU CAN TAKE THAT AND GET IT
OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?

HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HEAR HEAR!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JACQUES.

LISTEN, YOU FUCKING BUNCH
OF "ANIMALOGICAL" FREAKS,

I DON'T WANT
A FUCKING BIRTHDAY CAKE

AND I DON'T WANT
A FUCKING BIRTHDAY!

SO TAKE THIS FUCKING THING
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!

DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?
GET THE FUCK OUT!

OUT OUT! ALL OF YOU, NOW.

GO! DO YOU HEAR ME?
GET THE FUCK OUT!

DON'T ANY OF YOU FUCKING
UNDERSTAND FUCKING ENGLISH?

GO, FUCK OUT!
FUCKING CRAZY.

I TOLD YOU SCHMUCKS,
I DON'T DO BIRTHDAYS, OKAY?

NOW YOU'RE BANNED,
ALL OF YOU, FOR A WEEK!

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
FOR A FUCKING CAKE.

FOR A FUCKING CAKE
HE BANS US.

OKAY.

I'M-- I'M WILLING
TO COMPROMISE,

ALTHOUGH I HATE
COMPROMISE

MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE IN THE WORLD.

BUT WHAT ELSE
CAN I DO?

YOU STABBED ME
IN THE BACK, LUCAS.

YOU'RE KICKING ME
WHEN I'M LYING DOWN

AND IN NO POSITION
TO DEFEND MYSELF.

I WAS BEGINNING
TO LIKE YOU, LUCAS.

I MADE THE FATAL MISTAKE
OF TRUSTING YOU.

<i>WHAT DO I GET?</i>
<i>BAFF.</i>

AS SOON AS I SHOW A TINY
SPOT OF VULNERABILITY,

YOU ATTACK ME.

YOU'RE A TRAITOR, LUCAS--
A FUCKING TRAITOR.

AND NOW I'M LYING HERE CLOSER
TO DEATH THAN EVER BEFORE

AND FROM THAT HOPELESS
POSITION I HAVE TO NEGOTIATE.

OKAY, THE BITCH CAN STAY.

<i>I'M NOT HAPPY WITH IT,</i>
<i>BUT YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.</i>

I HAVE TO KEEP
THE BUSINESS GOING.

AND IF THIS IS THE PRICE,
THEN THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

IF YOU REALLY HAVE IT IN YOU
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

OF MY HOPELESS CONDITION,
THEN GO AHEAD.

BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME
BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

THANK YOU.

IT SHOULDN'T COME
AS A SURPRISE

THAT YOUR HEART IS CLOSE
TO USELESS BY NOW.

SO WHAT I'M INTERESTED
IN DOING IS PUTTING YOU

ON A WAITING LIST
FOR A HEART TRANSPLANT.

WHOA WHOA WHOA.

WAITING LIST?

SOUNDS BAD.
I HATE WAITING.

WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

THERE'S A REASON
WE CALL YOU A PATIENT

AND THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

HA HA HA.
VERY FUNNY.

A POSITIVE ATTITUDE
WOULD REALLY HELP A LOT

WITH GETTING YOU THROUGH
ALL THIS WAITING.

AND IT'S GOING TO IMPROVE YOUR
CHANCES OF SURVIVING A TRANSPLANT.

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
YOU HAVE TO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE.

OKAY?
YOU CAN NEVER DRINK OR SMOKE AGAIN.

SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, DOC,
SEND ME BACK TO KINDERGARTEN?

YOU GOTTA REALIZE I'M A DIRTY
OLD BASTARD WITH FILTHY HABITS.

A NEW HEART
IS A PRECIOUS GIFT

AND WE ONLY
GIVE THEM TO THOSE

WHO ARE GOING TO TREAT THEIR
GIFT WITH RESPECT AND CARE.

I DON'T LIKE THE PATRONIZING
TONE OF YOUR VOICE.

TO BE FRANK, I DON'T LIKE
YOUR ATTITUDE AT ALL.

SOMEONE IS GONNA DIE SO YOU
CAN LIVE. DO YOU GET THAT?

YEAH, I GET IT.

NOW DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT YOU
ON THE LIST OR NOT? - YES, PLEASE.

AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IMPLIES?
YES, DOC.

JACQUES, YOU OKAY?

HERE.

TAKE A LOOK.

THE DOCTOR GAVE ME
THIS PHONE.

HE'S THE ONLY PERSON ON
EARTH WHO HAS THIS NUMBER.

WHEN IT RINGS IT CAN
ONLY MEAN ONE THING:

THAT A NEW HEART
HAS ARRIVED.

SO WHEN
THE CALL COMES,

I HAVE TO BE AT THE
HOSPITAL WITHIN 20 MINUTES.

THAT MEANS I MUST BE
READY AT ALL TIMES--

THE SUITCASE PACKED,
READY TO GO.

JUST LIKE THAT.

HI.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

JACQUES, LET ME EXPLAIN.

JACQUES, I'M SORRY.

JACQUES, I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU...

WE JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR BUSINESS

TO INCORPORATE
THE DINING HALL.

WE CAN EASILY MANAGE IT
NOW THAT WE ARE THREE.

YOU HAVE NOT
UNDERSTOOD A THING.

THIS IS NOT A CAFE.
THIS IS NOT A RESTAURANT.

THIS IS NOT A BISTRO,
NOR IS THIS A BRASSERIE. THIS IS A BAR.

AND BY DEFINITION,
THE CAPACITY OF A BAR

CANNOT EXCEED 13 PEOPLE.

THINK JESUS AND HIS APOSTLES.
I'M SORRY.

LUCAS, YOU MUST
CONTROL THAT BITCH.

JUST KEEP HER
OUT OF MY FACE.

SO HOW WAS YOUR DATE LAST NIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

I CAN'T GET ANYTHING GOING.
I-- I CAN'T EVEN...

IT'S HARD ENOUGH
MEETING WOMEN.

COME ON, RODDIE, YOU OWN A
FLOWER SHOP, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

THAT'S A PRIME
POSITION TO BE IN.

NO, SEE, EVERYBODY THINKS THAT.
IT DOESN'T WORK

BECAUSE THE PEOPLE COMING
INTO THE SHOP-- WOMEN--

THEY'RE BUYING FLOWERS
FOR EITHER THEIR BOYFRIENDS

OR THEIR HUSBANDS.

SO, YOU KNOW,
ME HITTING ON THEM

WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT
IS JUST RIDICULOUS.

AND THEN WHEN I DO GO ON A
DATE AND I BRING THEM FLOWERS

AND, YOU KNOW, THEY KNOW
THAT I OWN A FLOWER SHOP,

ANYTHING I BRING THEM
IS JUST NOT IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH.

FORGET THE FUCKING FLOWERS,
ALL RIGHT?

YOU'VE GOTTA FIND
A NEW GROOVE.

<i>YEAH,
IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.</i>

<i>YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL.</i>
<i>JUST TALK TO HER, RODDIE.</i>

APRIL...

UH, WHAT DO YOU
USUALLY DO AFTER WORK?

SHE'S SURE GOT THE BITCH
ELEMENT DOWN TO A SCIENCE.

YOU SHOULD BE TAKING
NOTES HERE, LUCAS.

<i>YOU NEED TO BE MORE OF A BITCH</i>
<i>YOURSELF. YOU'RE TOO NICE.</i>

YOU SEE, WE'RE NOT
HERE TO SAVE PEOPLE;

WE'RE HERE
TO DESTROY THEM.

<i>SCHNEKE,</i> I BELIEVE YOU
HAVESOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO ME.

WHAT IS IT?
MY BREATH. YOU TOOK IT AWAY.

<i>I CAN'T BREATHE WHEN I SEE YOU.</i>

MY HEART STARTS TO RACE.

CAN YOU FEEL IT
GO PITTER-PATTER?

I WAS JUST TALKING TO HER!
GET OUT.

GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE
AND DON'T COME BACK.

ROGER.

WHERE'S APRIL?

SHE LEFT.

THE BAR IS NO PLACE
FOR A WOMAN--

YOU WERE RIGHT
ON THAT ONE.

APRIL WAS MORE OF A MAN
THAN MOST OF THE SISSIES
THAT HANG AROUND HERE.

SO YOU LIKED HER?

I DIDN'T COMPLETELY
DISLIKE HER.

LUCAS, GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE.

WHERE'S APRIL?
SHE'S GONE.

IT'S A DAMN SHAME.

THERE USED TO BE
SPARKS AROUND HER.

PSSH,
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HEY, WHOA.

THERE'S SOME
SPARKS FOR YOU.

HERE'S TO YOU MORONS.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
I DON'T KNOW.

LEAVE ME ALONE, JACQUES.

LET'S GO FOR A SPIN,
LEAVE THIS CITY FOR A WHILE.

I DON'T WANT TO.
<i>YOU LOOK MISERABLE.</i>

<i>YOU NEED TO CHEER UP.</i>

A JUNKYARD?

HOW UPLIFTING.

YOU'RE WASTING
MY TIME, JACQUES.

<i>I ALWAYS
DREAMED OF DOING THIS.</i>

LIFE'S TOO SHORT
FOR LOUSY CARS.

JACQUES, I'M VERY SORRY.
IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.

NO HEART?

NO, WE GOT THE HEART,
BUT IT WAS NO GOOD.

IT HAPPENS VERY RARELY,
BUT IT DOES HAPPEN.

THE HEART WAS NO GOOD.

YOU MEAN YOU SCARED THE
SHIT OUT OF ME FOR NOTHING?

<i>I SHIT MY PANTS</i>
<i>BECAUSE OF THIS.</i>

<i>HEART RATE: 140.</i>
OKAY, CHECK HIS BLOOD PRESSURE.

JACQUES, CAN YOU BREATHE?

CAN YOU BREATHE DEEPLY?
TAKE DEEP BREATHS. -

BLOOD PRESSURE
HAS FALLEN TO 70/40.

LET'S GIVE HIM 2mg
OF METOPROLOL, I.V.

JACQUES, LISTEN TO ME.
CAN YOU LIFT YOUR HEAD?

CAN YOU LIFT YOUR HEAD?

OKAY, THAT'S IT.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP YOU HERE.

HERE YOU GO.

WHAT IS THIS?
<i>WELL, IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.</i>

WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM,
A FUCKING HAMSTER?

HEY.

I DON'T THINK
WE'VE BEEN INTRODUCED.

MY NAME'S BEN. I'M YOUR NEW
ROOMMATE. NICE TO MEET YOU.

JACQUES.

WHAT BLOOD TYPE ARE YOU?

O.
<i>O'S GOOD.</i>

NO THREAT IN O.
WHAT BLOOD TYPE ARE YOU?

FUCKIN' "A."

<i>* CHRISTMAS BELLS</i>

<i>* CHRISTMAS BELLS</i>

<i>* RINGING LOUD AND STRONG</i>

<i>* FOLLOW THEM</i>

<i>* FOLLOW THEM</i>

<i>* YOU'VE BEEN AWAY</i>
<i>TOO LONG *</i>

<i>* THERE IS NO CHRISTMAS</i>

<i>* LIKE A HOME CHRISTMAS</i>

<i>* THAT'S THE TIME OF YEAR *</i>

<i>* ALL ROADS LEAD HOME.</i>

<i>THROUGHOUT THESE EXHAUSTING</i>
<i>MONTHS OF DOUBT AND PAIN,</i>

MY ONLY CONSOLATION
HAS BEEN VISUALIZING

THAT DUCK
SERVED ON A PLATE.

HANG ON THERE, LUCAS.

<i>LOWER THE BLADE</i>
<i>FOR A SEC.</i>

JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

WHAT WOULD
YOU BUDDHA PEOPLE EAT?

<i>SAY DURING</i>
<i>THE FESTIVAL OF VESAK.</i>

DUCK, PERSONALLY.

I THOUGHT BUDDHISM
AND VEGETARIANISM

WENT HAND IN HAND.

I MEAN, THE FIRST
PRECEPT OF BUDDHISM

IS TO AVOID KILLING
OR HARMING ANY LIVING BEING.

SO HOW CAN YOU RECONCILE THAT
WITH EATING MEAT?

ACTUALLY,
THE BUDDHA HIMSELF ATE MEAT

<i>AND WAS THEREFORE</i>
<i>NOT A VEGETARIAN.</i>

IN FACT, IT IS THOUGHT THAT
HE DIED FROM FOOD POISONING

AFTER EATING ROTTEN PORK.

<i>HOWEVER,</i>
<i>HE ADVISED THAT MEAT</i>

<i>SHOULD ONLY BE EATEN</i>

WHEN IT WAS NOT SEEN,
HEARD, OR SUSPECTED

THAT THE ANIMAL
HAD BEEN KILLED

SPECIFICALLY FOR
THE PURPOSE OF EATING.

<i>LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES</i>
<i>TO DEATH HERE.</i>

I MEAN, THE MEAT YOU EAT
IS OBVIOUSLY FROM ANIMALS

BUTCHERED FOR
THE PURPOSE OF EATING.

SO YOU'RE BREAKING THE FIRST
PRECEPT WITH EVERY BITE YOU CHEW.

AS I SEE IT,
I'M NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED

IN THE KILLING
OF THE ANIMAL.

OH.

SO YOU FOUND THE MEAT
AT THE BUTCHER'S.

<i>YOU DIDN'T SEE</i>
<i>NO ANIMAL BEING KILLED</i>

AND YOU DON'T SUSPECT
THAT THE BUTCHER

KILLED AN ANIMAL
FOR THE PURPOSE OF EATING.

KIND OF.

YOU BUDDHA MONKEYS REALLY
OUGHT TO GET YOUR STORY STRAIGHT.

THIS IS FUCKING NONSENSE.
CAN I KILL IT NOW?

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

<i>I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>EATING AN ANIMAL TONIGHT.</i>

CAN'T YOU PREPARE
SOMETHING WITHOUT A FACE?

LIKE AN OCTOPUS
OR SOMETHING?

YOU'RE BECOMING A SISSY, JACQUES.
<i>I KNOW, I KNOW.</i>

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

I'VE BECOME ALL SENSITIVE
AND SENTIMENTAL LATELY.

<i>WOW, THAT LOOKS WONDERFUL.</i>

MERRY CHRISTMAS.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, JACQUES.

WILL I SEE YOU
TOMORROW?

NO, I'M ONLY ALLOWED OUT
FOR CHRISTMAS.

I HAVE TO BE BACK AT THE
HOSPITAL BY MIDNIGHT.

HAH, LIKE CINDERELLA.

YOU KNOW, TONIGHT
I'VE BEEN GIVING

LOTS OF THOUGHT
TO SOMETHING.

WHAT IS IT, JACQUES?

LET'S SELL THE BAR.

SELL IT?

WHY?

WELL, AS YOU INTELLIGENTLY
POINTED OUT EARLIER,

I HAVE BECOME A BIT
OF A SISSY LATELY.

WELL, I WAS
ONLY JOKING, JACQUES.

DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
NO NO, BUT IT'S TRUE.

SINCE I GOT
THE FALSE HEART,

SOMETHING CHANGED IN ME.

I BECAME A SISSY.

IT'S JUST A TEMPORARY THING,
YOU KNOW.

YOU'RE A BIT WEAK
AT THE MOMENT.

YOU'LL BE BACK
ON YOUR FEET IN NO TIME,

INSULTING PEOPLE
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW.

WELL, THANKS FOR THE
ENCOURAGEMENT, BUT I'M NOT SO SURE.

YOU SEE, LUCAS...

I'VE WITNESSED
A CHANGE IN YOU TOO.

<i>I MEAN,</i>
<i>YOU USED TO BE</i>

<i>SO OPEN-HEARTED</i>
<i>AND KIND--</i>

HOPELESSLY KIND
WHEN IT COMES

TO THIS TYPE OF WORK.

BUT SINCE APRIL LEFT,

<i>YOU'VE BECOME</i>
<i>BITTER AND COLD,</i>

<i>AGGRESSIVE EVEN.</i>

AND...

IT JUST MAKES ME SAD.

DON'T BE SAD, JACQUES.

IT'S MISSION ACCOMPLISHED,
YOU KNOW.

<i>BUT IT'S A FAILED</i>
<i>MISSION, LUCAS.</i>

I DON'T WISH FOR YOU
TO COPY MY FATE.

I DON'T WANT YOU TO BECOME
BITTER AND COLD.

<i>LIFE'S TOO SHORT</i>
<i>FOR THAT.</i>

I THINK WE SHOULD
THROW IN THE TOWEL,

LOOK OURSELVES IN THE EYES,
AND ADMIT THAT WE FAILED.

<i>LET'S GET RID</i>
<i>OF THE FUCKIN' PLACE.</i>

<i>WE'LL SPLIT IT 50/50.</i>

I WANT TO SPEND
THE LAST DAYS OF MY LIFE

IN A BETTER PLACE
THAN THIS SHITHOLE.

YOU GO AHEAD,
BUT I DON'T WANT ANY OF IT.

YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING.

I CAME HERE TO HELP.

AND I'M SORRY
THAT I LET YOU DOWN--

YOU AND APRIL.

NO.

YOU OWN HALF OF EVERYTHING

<i>AND THE REMAINING HALF</i>

<i>GOES TO ENRIQUE</i>
<i>AND JOSEPHINE.</i>

YOU'RE BACK.

YOU'RE BACK.

AH, THIS IS
A FANTASTIC CHOICE.

HERE IS TO
"AVRIL" THE GREAT.

<i>HEY, LUCAS.</i>

I THINK I NEED TO GO
BACK TO MY ROOM.

OKAY.

CAN YOU DEFINE THE PAIN
ON A SCALE OF 0-10?

HOW'S HIS PAIN PRESENTING?
<i>10.</i>

RESPIRATION?
<i>LABORED.</i>

LET'S GIVE HIM .25 NITROGLYCERIN
AND 5mg OF MORPHINE.

<i>LUCAS.</i>
YEAH, I'M COMING. I'M COMING.

WANT CHAMPAGNE?
YES, PLEASE.

ESTRAGON? ESTRAGON?

WHAT DO YOU NEED?

<i>OH!</i>

MM.

<i>* BEFORE THE MIND</i>

<i>* WAS AN OPEN BOOK</i>

<i>* THE PAGES ALL WHITE</i>

<i>* AS WHITE CAN BE</i>

<i>* BUT THEN SOMEONE STARTS</i>

<i>* FILLING THEM IN</i>

<i>* THE INK IS BLACK</i>

<i>* AND THE WORDS ARE GRIM</i>

<i>* SECRETS ARE SOON</i>

<i>* TO BE DISCOVERED</i>

<i>* AND HIDDEN THINGS</i>

<i>* WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND</i>

<i>* FORBIDDEN WORDS</i>

<i>* ARE SLOWLY MOVING IN</i>

<i>* JUST LIKE WORDS</i>

<i>* THEY MAKE NO SOUND</i>

<i>* IT'S THERE *</i>

<i>* IT'S NOT GONE *</i>

<i>* THE BOAT SHOULD BE</i>

<i>* SAILING OUT TONIGHT</i>

<i>* FILLED WITH A DREAM</i>

<i>* THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT *</i>

<i>* BUT WHEN IT SINKS</i>

<i>* THEY WASH UP</i>
<i>ON THE SHORE *</i>

<i>* FOLLOW THE PATH</i>

<i>* BACK TO YOUR DOOR</i>

<i>* SECRETS ARE SOON</i>

<i>* TO BE DISCOVERED</i>

<i>* AND HIDDEN THINGS</i>

<i>* WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND</i>

<i>* FORBIDDEN WORDS</i>

<i>* ARE SLOWLY MOVING IN</i>

<i>* JUST LIKE WORDS</i>

<i>* THEY MAKE NO SOUND</i>

<i>* IT'S THERE *</i>

<i>* IT'S NOT GONE *</i>

<i>* TONIGHT.</i>
