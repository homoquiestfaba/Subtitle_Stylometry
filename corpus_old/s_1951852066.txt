This is Senator John Kennedy...

the Democratic nominee for
the office of the Presidency.

The 1960's presents our country...

with great opportunities
and great challenges.

...Just what makes
that little ol' ant...

...Think he'll move
that rubbertree plant?

...Anyone knows an ant can't
move a rubbertree plant...

...But he's got high hopes...

...He's got heigh hopes...

...He's got high apple
pie in the sky hopes...

...So any time you're gettin' low...

...lnstead of lettin' go...

...Just remember that ant...

...Oops, there goes
another rubbertree plant...

...Oops, there goes
another rubbertree plant...

...Oops, there goes
another problem, kerplop...

...Kerplop.

...He went away,
and you hung around...

...And bothered me every night...

...I wouldn't go out with you...

...You said things
that weren't very nice...

...My boyfriend's back
and you're gonna be in trouble...

...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back...

...When you see him comin'
you better cut out on the double...

...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back...

...So look out now
'cause he's coming after you...

...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back...

...Hey, he knows
what you've been trying...

...And he knows
that you've been lying...

...He's been gone
for such a long time...

...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back...

...Now he's back
and things will be fine...

...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back...

...'Cause he's kind of big
and he's awful strong...

...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back.

Kit-Kat, come on!
I need to get in there!

Do you mind?

Not if I get to use
the john sometime this year!

Michael, I can't believe
you left your report card

lying on the counter!
I'm so proud of you!

She's still in there.

Did you see this?

Oh, all A's.

Me, I prefer a variety of letters.

Your father is going
to be so pleased.

I think you ought
to see this.

Don't tell me. Let me guess...

A, A, A, A... and A.

Way to go.

Did you read this?
Olzcievski transferred to Penn State.

Looks like the Fighting Irish
need a quarterback.

Dad, let me just
enjoy the dance tonight...

I'll worry about
Notre Dame tomorrow.

You don't have a thing
to worry about.

Kit-Kat: Hey, you guys...

Well? How do I look?

Long live the King!

Thank you.

(slow-tempo music plays)

("The Twist" plays)

Dance with me!

(music stops abruptly)

You are grounded, young lady.
Until further notice.

Why?
I didn't do anything.

That's not what
Sister Elizabeth said.

What did Sister Busybody say?

You stay out of this, mister.

She said
you behaved disgracefully.

I was dancing.

In a lewd
and inappropriate manner.

My gosh, Katie
you're fifteen years old...

Sixteen!
You can't behave this way!

Katie, if you don't
respect yourself,

how to you expect anybody else to?

This is crazy. I was dancing, too.
Everybody was.

That's what Sister Elizabeth said.

Then the whole thing descended
into chaos after Katie started it.

That is so wrong. Everybody did it.
Why is she grounded?

It's not fair!

Fair? You want fair?

Okay, you're grounded, too.

("Stand By Me" plays)

...Reverend Taylor,
it's all set...

It'll be the four of us.
Next Tuesday.

They just keep
beatin' on you, Daddy.

That's what they do, Emmet.

How come nobody'll stop 'em?

King tried
to get the National Guard...

Kennedy's too busy
worrying about the Russians.

What're y'all gonna do?

We keep sittin',
We keep marchin'.

We go on to Birmingham.

I lived in Alabama.

I'm ready to do whatever we have to...

but that Sheriff Bull Connor,

that son-of-a-bitch is crazy.

His idea of law
is twelve-gauge and double-barrel.

You march in his town,
he'll call out the dogs

and the fire hoses.

That's why Martin
picked Birmingham...

You want attention...
You got to put on a show.


Okay, Brian.

Brian...
I'll be open.

("No Where To Run" plays)

Hey, Brian!

You did it!
I'm so proud of ya!

You're gonna look so good
in blue and gold!

What a great pass!

Hey, good game, Steve!
I still can't believe it!

Believe it!
We did it!

Wells, lucky catch!

A couple of scouts
from Notre Dame thought so...

I guess they figure
if God's lookin' out for you,

you're their kinda guy.

They're in the tunnel.
Don't keep 'em waiting.

Brian, great season, kid.

It's been a pleasure
to be your coach...

They didn't get your name.
Your jersey was pretty dirty.

Yeah.

You made the play,
same as you made all year.

They got the right guy.

I never expected that scholarship,
that was Dad.

The important thing is,
you talk to those scouts

and I get a couple of
six-packs to celebrate.

Thanks, pal.

There he is!
Great game, Champ!

What did the scouts say?
Did they come down?

Yeah, they came down...

I knew it!
Let's go out and celebrate...

I got plans.
We'll celebrate as a family...

Dad!
I'm goin' with my friends.

There it is, ladies.
Sooner or later,

the bottle comes up empty.

They didn't tell
you that, did they?

And you know what
you gotta do?

I will tell you,
as soon as I figure it out.

Ain't that right, Bud?

That's right, Bri.
You're the best, man.

Don't you forget it.

Now, you are
just the man I'm lookin' for!

Can I help you?

You already are!
You're defending freedom...

We need more men like you!
And do you know why?

'Cause you can buy beer,
and we can't.

Sorry,
I'm in uniform.

Aw, c'mon -!

I'll get it.

Thank you! Good man!
Good man!

Damn, that uniform looked good!
Did you see that?

Hey, mom,
hey, dad...

What time is it?

It's... late.

You look like you were
having a good time.

Yeah, a little celebration.

I... I got some good news.

Notre Dame?

Marine Corps.

What?

I enlisted.
I'm a Marine, just like you.

You did what?

I joined up.
I thought you'd be proud.

What about school?
What about...

Notre Dame?

See, that's the problem,
it's called the real world,

which is where I live...
and down here,

I don't go to Notre Dame
'cause I ain't got the grades...

that's Mikey department.

And except in your mind,
I ain't got the moves, either.

Brian... Honey, what happened?

Nothing happened, Ma.
I'm just not good enough.

And I'm not even sorry,
'cause it wasn't my fault.

I did the best I could,
that's what's important, right?

I think I could be
a really good Marine.

I really thought
that would make you proud of me.

Sweetheart...
Of course I'm proud of you.

Dad?

I've never been prouder
of anyone in my life.

Is that all you're taking?
I don't need much.

I guess they give you
everything you need.

Not everything...
Come here.

I'm gonna miss you,
Kit-Kat.

Take care of her.

Dad, it's okay...
C'mon, take it!

It's okay, Mom
We're not even at war with anybody.

I'm gonna miss you...

All right, guys.
I'll write.

And toss the gauntlet
before the feet of tyranny,

And I say, segregation now,
segregation tomorrow,

and segregation forever.

("Baby, What You Want
Me To Do" plays)

But you saw those pictures on TV...

That's what Father Monahan
was talking about.

I don't know, Michael.

It's a chance to learn
about the real world.

Bill?
Why can't I go?

What do you think?

It's a long way, we don't know
what's gonna happen in Mississippi.

Father Monahan did say that he
wouldn't let him out of his sight.

Do you think he'd say it was okay
if it wasn't safe as church?

Isn't this what
President Kennedy said...

"Ask not what
your country can do for you"?

I think the Kennedys
would let their kids go.

Kennedy's kids, eh?

("Can I Get A Witness" plays)

We're this
army of freedom fighters,

sweeping away a tired,
bigoted oligarchy.

Are you a student?
A freedom fighter.

Listen, everybody.
We're going to do a job.

To register Negroes to vote.

We may not be that welcome
down in Greenwood.


Reverend Taylor: Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.

How are you doing?

Welcome to Greenwood.

I'm Reverend Taylor,
this is my son, Emmet.

Hello.

How're you doing, Father?
Thank you for coming.

Willie Taylor,
thanks for comin' down.

Hi.
Hi.

Are you in charge
of the music?

No. My daddy put this on.

Seems like a cool guy.

Have you marched before?

He wouldn't let me before,
but since you're goin'-

What else you got there?

Jackie Wilson?
No.

Sam Cooke?

James Brown.

You don't know James Brown?
Where you been?

("Shout" begins)

Emmet!

Turn the music up!

You puttin' shame
on that flag, boy.

Give it to me.

Y'all hear me, boy?
Give it to me!

You damn Communist niggers,
get yourself on home, now!

We are home, Mr. Manders.

Y'all are obstructin'
the business of the county,

and I'm askin' y'all to move on.

This is a constitutional assembly,
it's protected by law!

This is a peaceful assembly.

Y'all are under arrest!
Everybody inside. Move.

...We are not afraid,
we are not afraid...

...We are not afraid today...

...Deep in my heart...
I do believe...

I've known you man and boy
for 20 years, Willie...

I ain't never known you
to act a fool before.

You keep it up,
you gonna be in serious trouble.

Tell your city friends
they best pack up and git.

I ain't gonna save
your ass next time!

These cameras,
they ain't gonna be here every day.

No, they won't, Sheriff...

but we will...

until every person that wants to vote
in this town is registered.

...Deep in my heart,
I do believe...

...We shall overcome, someday...

...We shall overcome...

Take care of yourself.

Thanks for everything.

Don't you ever forget
what you've seen here.

I won't.

Keep the faith...
Keep the faith.

...Sweet land of liberty,
of thee I sing!

Land where my fathers died-
Land of the pilgrim's pride...

From every mountainside,
let freedom ring!

...lf America is to be
a great nation...

This must become true.
So let freedom ring!

From the prodigious hilltops
of New Hampshire,

...from every hill and
molehill in Mississippi...

From every mountainside!
Let freedom ring...

When this happens...
(cheering and applause)

...when we let freedom ring...

...from every village
and every hamlet...

from every state,
and every city...

Our church!

...we will be able
to speed up that day...

when all of God's children...

Black men and white men,
Jews and Gentiles...

Protestants and Catholics...

Will be able to join hands...

and sing in the words
of the old Negro spiritual,

"Free at last,
Free at last...

Thank God Almighty,
We are free at last!"

Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

I will fear no evil.

For thou art with me...

Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me...

Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

Thou anointest my head with oil...

My cup runneth over.

And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever.

Amen.

("Can I Get A Witness" playing)

You got no choice, Reverend.

Take the gospel to L.A.

We'll finish the work here.

(Teacher:) If a line intersects
the equal sides of an isosceles triangle

and is parallel to the base...

...the new triangle
formed is also what?

Isosceles.

If an acute angle of
one right triangle

equals an acute angle
of another right triangle...

("Bookends Theme" plays)

How's my baby?

I brought you
a little tomato soup.

Thanks, Mom.

After being shot...

by an unknown assailant...

during a motorcade drive
through downtown Dallas...

The President died...

approximately 25 minutes...

after the attack
took place.

He had been rushed,
bleeding and unconscious...

to the Parkland Memorial Hospital
in Dallas...

(laughing - talking)

("My Girl" playing)

Let's play a new game.
"7 Minutes in Heaven."

Let's go.

Now it starts.

Go get her.

See you guys later.

Have fun.

Okay...

They're not comin' out.
They're stayin' in there.

Go, Jonathan.

(door shuts)
What's that?

Mr. Herlihy?
If you're looking for Katie,

I don't know
where she is...

Katie!

Dad?

Dad, are you okay?

I'm so sorry,
I'll never do that again...

I promise.

I wish I could believe you.

Never make me no underdog...

Never talk about
who's gonna stop me...

Ain't nobody gonna stop me!

Not a heavyweight in the world
fast enough to stop me!

...l'm strong,
and I'm pretty, and...

Emmet, you done your homework?

I was gonna do it after dinner.

No, do your homework now.

I hear you...

You hear me,
but you don't understand.

The world is changing, son,
for the better...

We gotta long way to go,
but look where we are.

Soon you'll be able
to go to any college...

You can vote,
be whatever you want.

But you have to take advantage
of these opportunities now!

They were paid for in blood.

You done?

Go do your homework.

It can't be that expensive.

You're not paying for it.

If you wanna live in a dorm...
I don't.

Or an apartment, it's simple,
get a job.

I can't,
I have classes at 11, 2:30 and 4.

Not to mention
the 7:30 Civics class...

plus homework!

I know, the world's smallest violin
playing "Hearts and Flowers."

Get some new material.

I'm giving you an opportunity
I never had...

To go to school,
earn a decent living...

It isn't a trade school!
It's about the world.

Wanna learn about the world?
Don't work, you don't eat.

That's the world.

This a private war,
or can any old soldier join?

Got off earlier than I thought.

Hey, Brian!

Kit-Kat, I missed you, too.

Sergeant, already!
Born leader, huh?

Take after the old man.

I'm so happy you're home!
It's not gonna for be long.

It's okay,
I've got some good news.

I'm going to Vietnam.

That's good!

We'll stay for as long
as it takes...

we shall provide whatever
help is required...

...to win the battle against
the Communists insurgents.

("The Times They Are
A Changin"' plays)

Good morning.

On behalf of Loyola University,

let me welcome you to
the Dawn Soul Patrol!

The Civics course designed
for those students

without friends in high places.

Please call me Father Dan

as we mutually court
eternal damnation this semester.

For those of you
who associate this collar

with the status quo,
please be advised...

I want us out
of our undeclared war in Vietnam.

I founded the
Catholic Peace Fellowship,

I registered
voters in Mississippi...

I'm a pacifist
and I believe in social protest.

I'd like nothing more than to
turn you on to the possibility...

that you can make a difference.

Everyone in favor?

Let's change the world.

Father Dan? Michael Herlihy.

You mentioned
an undeclared war in Vietnam?

What was that about?

Our country is involved
in a civil war in Southeast Asia

in order to pursue the Cold War
against Communism.

Most Americans like you
haven't been told about it.

If you want to find out more,

you ought to go to
the teach-in in New York.

I don't know...
My brother's over there.

Then you have to go.

You owe it to yourself to find
out as much as you possibly can.

It's the first nationwide
student anti-war meeting.

Got plenty of room
if you need a ride.

Three Communist PT boats
attacked an American destroyer

off the coast
of Vietnam yesterday...

Today, President Johnson's
response was hard and tough.

To any armed attack
upon our forces...

we shall reply.

To any in Southeast Asia
who ask our help

in defending their freedom...

We shall give it.

...When the operation
of the machine becomes so odious,

makes you so sick at heart
that you can't take part...

...put your bodies
upon the gears, upon the wheels,

upon all the apparatus,
you've got to make it stop!

All right,
let's settle in, now!

Please, sit down - sit down!

Thank you.

My name is Kenny Klein,

president of the
Columbia chapter of SDS.

If you're from out of town,
thank you for coming to New York.

If you're here for the
Young Republicans convention,

boy, are you ever
in the wrong place!

This is a teach-in
against the war.

We are here to do two things...

first, to let you know what is
really going on in Vietnam.

And the second and most important...

...to bring the machinery
of this war

to a grinding halt.

The floor's open...

George Lindelof, SNCC.

Organize more
teach-ins like this one.

I think it's great!

Thomas Hayes,
Ann Arbor Students Against The War.

I worked on the first teach-in,
and we learned

that you have to focus
the media and the public

attention to the problem.
Not just marching...

Petitions! Petitions!
Letter-writing campaigns...

The United States government
is killing human beings in Vietnam.

Right now.
We have to stop them.

Send them 10,000 letters
with American names on them.

They'll stop!

What're we gonna do?
Blow up the troop trains?

Quiet.
What did you just say?

Blow up the troop trains.
I'm kidding.

Now, that's an idea!

We don't have to
blow up a train,

all we have to do
is lie down in front of it.

What if they run over us?

That's the whole point, obviously
they're not gonna run over us.

Excuse me...

It's a great idea,
but it's way too dangerous.

Unless the people are experienced
in passive resistance...

What's your name?
Sarah Weinstock.

Actions like that
require more responsibility.

What delegation?
I'm not with a delegation.

You're speaking
on behalf of...?

Herself.

Michael Herlihy, Chicago.
Progressive Catholics.

When we act like the enemy,
we become them.

If you're going to ask people
to lie down in front of trains,

the least you can do is listen
when they have something to say.

That was beautiful.
I'd like to get to business...

Some suggestions?
March on the Pentagon...

You wanna
get some coffee?

Yeah.

I can't believe
your parents let you go

to Mississippi.
That's amazing.

If you met them,
you really wouldn't believe it.

I don't think
we realized what we were doing.

My parents,
Upper East Side liberals.

We discuss politics,
from McCarthyism

to Civil Rights, but that's it!

That's all we do, we talk.

Heaven forbid, I should actually
ever do something.

Well, you're here.

What's your major?

My major's a major joke.
I don't even know.

It's supposed to be Art History,

but I'm thinking about
Political Science.

How about you?

History, but I keep thinking

if I'm studying it,
I'm not making it.

"He who's not busy being born,
is busy dying."

That's Dylan?
Yeah.

Where'd you get turned on to him?
In Mississippi.

Some guy shows up in
the field and starts singing.

It was Dylan.
Are you serious?

Amazing.

I haven't done anything.

Look...
What?

No lines.
Not one.

You wanna try
and find him?

Who?
Dylan.

He plays
all over the Village.

I don't know where,
but do you wanna look?

I'm ready to go anywhere.
"Ready for to fade..."

"Into my own parade."

Cast your dancin' spell my way,
I promise to go wanderin..."

("Hey Mister Tambourine Man"
plays)

I'd like to start with a real
protest song, called,

"I Ain't Marchin' Anymore."

The defendants Lenny Bruce
and Howard Solomon

were tried on
two separate counts...

giving an indecent performance,
in violation of Section 11-48

of the penal law of New York.

That's the Grand Jury.
That was the first bust.

"The rooster crows
at the break of dawn."

"Look out your window
and I'll be gone."

"Don't think twice,
it's all right."

The most amazing night...

Are you going to Berkeley
to stop the troop trains?

What do you think?

I don't think
I can wait that long.

I think you should
enroll at Columbia.

Art history
or Political Science?

Gotta go.

Oh, damn!

What?
What'd you forget?

My heart...

Good night, Bob...

("She Belongs To Me" playing)

Dearest Michael, your paper
on nonviolence

and social change
was amazing.

A strong argument
from what you saw in Greenwood.

Michael:
Sarah, Angel of the Mysteries.

Your poems are like a rainstorm
on my desert soul.

Have you heard
the new Dylan album?

I play "Love Minus Zero"
over and over,

and think of you.

Dear Michael,
I've given up poetry.

It seems like a completely
bourgeois indulgence

when there's so much
work to do.

I can't wait for the troop train
sit-in at Berkeley on the 15th.

Will you be there?

...There she was,
just walkin' down the street...

...She looked good,
she looked fine...

...Before I knew it,
she was walkin' next to me...

...I knew we was
falling in love...

...Now, we're together,
nearly every single day...

...l'm hers, she's mine...

...l'm hers, she's mine...

...wedding bells
are gonna chime...

...We're singin'...

...Oh, yeah.

Thank You!

Keep drinking.
The drunker you get...

the better we sound.

Hey little girl
in the high school sweater...

"Gee, I'd like
to know you better."

Wow, you're so beautiful.

Thank you.

You wanna
go upstairs?

What's upstairs?

Why don't you come and find out?

Okay.

Okay?

I gotta split, you know?
Time for my second set.

Am I gonna see you?

I'll be right downstairs.
No, I mean, really.

Sure, absolutely.
I mean, if you want to.

Soon as we get paid,
I'm going to San Francisco.

That's where all
the action is.

Well...

Here's where we're staying.

If you get out there,
gimme a call, okay?

...Don't let the sun
catch you cryin'...

...Tonight's the time
for all your tears...

...Your heart may be
broken tonight...

...but tomorrow
in the morning light...

...Don't let the sun
catch you cryin'...

Forget a day, take two...

Never three.

There are is
an instruction sheet,

but that's really
all there is to it.

You've just taken control of
your own body and your own life.

Have you thought this through?

I think so.

Do you have any
concerns about the Pill?

Yeah.
How to keep Mom from finding them.

Will he marry you?

Are you sure?

He doesn't even
know my name, Mom.

There are things we can do.
Nobody has to know...

There are places you can
go to to have the baby...

It's not like a dress you grow
out of and give away, my God!

Then, we can raise
the baby right here.

I'm home!

Hey, how's my girls?

What?

Brian...?

Brian's fine.

Well, what, then?

Now... don't say
anything foolish.

She's pregnant.

Whose?
Mine!

Oh Lord!
Mary and Joseph!

Bill...

Who did this?
Who knocked you up?

I want his name.
Now.

Don't do this!

Katie?

I'm gonna ask one more time,
what's his name?

I don't know!
There've been too many!

Your little girl's a whore!

Katie, don't say that!
You don't have to...

Michael!
I wanna have the baby!

I'm not going to let some
bastard into this house.

Who'd want to?
Be quiet, all of you!

A person can't even
hear herself think!

One person
sure as hell didn't!

For God's sake, Dad...
Shut up, Michael!

Listen to me,
young lady...

Young lady?
That's a laugh!

I'm not going to
let this problem

bring shame and ridicule
into this house!

It's not a problem,
it's a baby!

You're so smart!
You're so damn smart!

You weren't so smart
when you let this happen!

Bill!
Were you!

("Don't Worry Baby" playing)

Dear Michael,
thanks for the loan.

I miss you already.

I just couldn't face
Dad over the next six months,

or Brian when he comes home.

I'm sorry.
I know you understand.

I'll write as soon
as things get settled.

Ask Dad to forgive me.

I know Mom's
already making novenas...

All my love to you
and Mom... and Dad.

Love, Kit-Kat.

Thanks a lot.
Bye.

Neal?

Hi.

Wow... Katie from Chicago, right?

This is too cool.
Come on in.

I can't believe
you found me.

This is my old lady...
Melissa, Katie from Chicago.

Hi, Katie from Chicago.

Come on in...

This is kind of hard...

You're pregnant, right?

That is way out, mama.

I have ordered to Vietnam
the Air Mobile Division,

and other forces,
which will raise our fighting strength

from 75,000 to 125,000 men
almost immediately.

Additional forces
will be needed later...

and they will be
sent as requested.

If you're going to march,
sign up.

Take a petition and
sign up everybody else...

and don't come back
until it's filled.

Michael!

Do you like tuna?

It's my favorite flavor.

I wanna talk,
but I got all this work.

You don't think I came here
to see you, do ya?

Oh. If you're gonna march,
sign up...

If your gonna watch,

take a petition
and sign up everybody else.

What're you gonna do?
I'm marchin'.

Stay on the tracks!
Stop this train!

No more Americans
in Vietnam!

They have no choice!
The train will stop!

Don't get off the tracks,
the train will stop!

Stop this train!

Stop this train!
Stop the war!

Get off!

Stop the war!

Move!

It's not our war!
Stop the train!

Stop the train!
It's not our war!

("Do You Believe In Magic" plays)

It was amazing!
It was like you de-materialized

or did some
Buddhist transformation!

Buddhist transformation, huh?

Hey, you...
Pay.

What?

Hey, hey...
I got it.

Thank you very much.

Was it something I said?

You should read Fanon's
"Wretched of the Earth".

This guy, he's just
tryin' to make a buck...

The faster you pay
the faster he makes deliveries.

He comes from
a tribal culture,

and capitalism doesn't
leave time for rituals...

so he's had to trade
good manners for efficiency.

It's like getting caught under
the wheels of the revolution.

You're joking.

Sometimes, you have to
crawl into the belly of the beast.

The belly of the beast?
I think that's this carton...

That's cute.
All I'm suggesting...

is by not sharing
in the workers' struggle,

by not understanding what the
demands of free-market imperialism

have forced him to leave behind,

I'm not surprised you don't
understand his bad temper.

The tigers of wrath are wiser
than the horses of instruction.

I'm not trying
to compete with you...

"Beat, or cheat,
or mistreat you."

You dig Dylan?

Yeah.

He's gonna be in Newport in July,

I might be able to get us
a couple of backstage passes.

If you're interested.
Are you serious?

Yeah.

That would be amazing!

Yeah, it'd be fun...
It'd be nice.

Can Michael come?

I don't know.
I'm sure there are tickets left.

Wouldn't that be great!

Here.

I'm okay.
You're okay?

I don't think it works on me.

This a 2,000 year old
Native American sacrament...

It works on you.

Don't abandon us, now.
Smoke with us.

Nothing...

I'm not sure what's
supposed to happen...

I'm afraid it probably
doesn't affect me.

Wanna know the secret
of the universe?

Brownies.

If you can resist these,
you're definitely not stoned, okay?

Why doesn't somebody just
fly out there and bring her home?

She didn't put on
a return address.

We find guys in the jungle...

We can't find
somebody in San Francisco?

She hasn't given any indication
she wants us to find her.

I can't imagine why.

Don't talk to me
that way, young man.

I didn't say anything about you.

Stop it!
Both of you.

She's gone.
I just pray she comes back safe,

and with her baby.

I re-upped to fight the Reds.

You say "Reds" like there's
some monolithic Communist state...

The truth is, the Russians and
Chinese can't stand each other.

Besides, it's not about communism.

We stuck our noses
into a damn civil war.

I'm only here a few days,

do we have to talk about
my day job the whole time?

We just shouldn't be there, Bri.

You read a lot more than I do,

but don't you think the President
has bright boys working for him, too?

Except they have to prove LBJ can
shoot farther than Barry Goldwater.

Even if they destroy Vietnam
to prove it.

You talk this way
to Mom and Dad?

Yeah, I do.

You think they need to hear
your crap while I'm over there?

It's the truth.
And I'm worried about you...

Aw, bull!

You think you got
privileged information,

but you don't know squat!

You haven't even been there!

You shouldn't be there.
Who's gonna protect you?

From what?
What is your problem, Mikey?

Are we the bad guys now?
Am I a bad guy?

Brian?

You don't have boats
or airplanes bringing drugs...

The white man
brings it to Harlem.

The white man
makes you a drug addict,

The white man puts you
in jail for using drugs...

Who controls prostitution in Harlem?
It's the white man.

You don't have any distillery...

We don't put the seal
on that bottle of whiskey.

It's the white man.

We need the paint
on the walls, Emmet.

Calm down.
I don't want to calm down.

You hear what they're saying?

That Elijah Muhammed
had him killed.

Like Elijah Muhammed
works for the CIA.

We'll get the truth, son.
How we gonna get it?

We ain't never
got it before.

Government's got
no interest in it.

You really think they
wanna see black men free?

That's a lie.

Don't become bitter.
Hatred just drags you down.

You're wrong.
I want bitterness.

Bitterness
gives me strength.

Bitterness ends in chaos,
not freedom.

You remember Paul,
rejected by the disciples?

Tried for heresy at Jerusalem?

Beaten at Thessalonica.

Mobbed at Ephesus.

And still he said,
"Nothing shall separate us

from the love of God."

You made me memorize it.
That's King's sermon.

What did you ever get
for turning the other cheek?

Another slap.

Do you really think
being blasted with fire hoses

and beaten
is gonna change anything?

That's a lie!
I'll keep my rage and bitterness...

at least I know they're true.

("Time Of Seasons" plays)

You should come to La Honda.
It's not far away.

Mountain air!
It's gotta be good for "Rainbow".

"Rainbow", are you waiting
for some fresh air?

I think I should be near a doctor.

At Kesey's place there's
gonna be half a dozen midwives.

Tripping...

Yeah, on Owsley acid.
Blue.

You go ahead. If my little friend
decides to come out early,

I can always catch a ride.
Cool.

Bye, darlin.

You know the road.
Look for that sign that says,

"No left turn unstoned."

Hi! It's me.

Fine... you?

You sound busy.

I was wondering about Newport...

Should I come into New York
and we take the train together?

Oh...

Does Kenny have any
more room?

No, that's no problem...

I'll meet you there.

Nah, it's no problem.

Okay... Yeah,
I gotta go, too.

So, I guess...
I'll see you there.

I mean, I will.

Okay... Bye.

Sarah? Hey!

Michael!

Did you just get here?

Don't worry about it
Dylan hasn't played yet.

Hey, what's with the amps?

I don't know.
How are you?

Happy to see you.
Yeah, me too.

I'm sorry that I haven't
been able to write to you.

I'm really confused
about a lot of stuff right now.

I'm not.
I know.

Sarah!

Michael, how you doin'?
Hey, Kenny?

Good to see ya.

Look, I got 'em.
I could only get two,

We're gonna have
to catch you later, all right?

Sarah, come on, we're almost on.
Catch you in a bit.

It's Dylan.

He ain't done nothin'.
Drunk as a skunk...

You shouldn't
be drinking, sir.

I should be drinkin',
I just shouldn't be drivin'.

I'm gonna have to take you in.
You're drunk.

Aw, c'mon, You ain't got
to take me to no jail.

Yeah, he ain't done nothin!

Go on to jail.
Better'n stayin' with his mama.

Height?
Five foot ten.

Color of hair?
Black. I'm black all over!

Marquette?
Mama, I ain't drunk...

I can smell it!
Please don't let 'em take me.

You ain't even normal!
But, Mama, I just...

Get on away from me!
Mama!

What did you do to my son?
Leave me alone!

What happened?
Did he hit her?

I think he did.

Let me go!
The cops beatin' on a woman,

she ain't done nothin' wrong.

L.A.P. D kills somebody
just for bein' black.

What, they killed somebody?

("Like A Rolling Stone" playing)

Here. You're gonna need it, man.
Take it.

Just keep breathing...
Let's go!

I want my mom!

Hey, Emmet!

Put that down.

Put it down now,
I said! Put it down!

Give me that. We're going home.
Give it to me!

Thank God, I found you...
What's the matter with you?

Freeze!
Don't move!

("Sunshine of Your Love" playing)

Hey, Owl-Man!

I had some Pink last night.
It was freaky...

Like this Navajo desert
sunset landscape.

But the real
cosmic connection

was White Lightning.

It opens the door, man,
like, wide open...

It's like I'm sailin'
down some mexique bay!

White Lightning, man!

May I interest you in a little

Far Out!

...He was supposed to fire me,
but I quit.

Keep an eye out
for the owner.

Don't worry,
I'm the owner.

C'mon, it's free.

It's Jimi Hendrix!
Hey Jimi, what's happening?

The name's Emmet.

That's cool, Mr. Hendrix,
you wanna go incognito,

that's all right with me!

I don't even play guitar!

That's a cool disguise!
Thanks for the trip, man.

Katie, this is Jimi.
Emmet, shhh!

Sorry, incognito.

What's your sign?
Scorpio.

Far out! Me, too! I knew that!
Far out!

What's happenin'?
Hey, Brother!

A couple of brothers
would like to talk to you.

Huey.

I'm Bobby.

What's happenin'?
Goin' with it... Dancin'.

With a white bitch!
You don't like sisters?

No, bro',
sisters are fine.

You tryin' to lay
a trip on somebody?

You picked
the wrong man.

No trips, brother.
Look at yourself.

Look at us.

Who looks like
the white man's clown?

We don't blame you
if you're scared...

Every time a black man
tries to show his pride,

the pig takes him down.

I been there.
I ain't scared.

Then you're just the brother
we're looking for.

What's goin' on?
Packing.

For what?
The march on the Pentagon.

I told you you aren't!
Not as long

as you live
in this house!

Michael, your brother's
putting his life

on the line
in Vietnam.

You should be
ashamed of yourself!

I'm ashamed of my country
for putting him in that position.

It's not our war!
Ashamed of your country?

Is that why
I'm paying your tuition?

So you can turn into
some kind of hippie dropout?

Michael, you can
keep on defying me,

but if you go
on that march...

I can not have you
live in my house!

Your house?

I always thought
it was our house.

We're gonna get the Pentagon
to rise in the air...

And we're gonna
assemble a mass of holy men

And the Pentagon
is gonna rise...

into the air on October 21.

Vietnam is not our war.

We must say "No!"

No!

Are we gonna go?

No!

Hell, no!
We won't go!

Hell, no!
We won't go!

Yeah!

("Winds of Change" playing)

Tom! Hey!
How you doin'?

Hell of an attraction, huh?

Sarah!

(crowd chanting:)
Peace now! Peace now!

Everybody get back!

They won't hit the women!

Get the chicks in front...
they won't hit the women!

Wait!
No fighting!

Link arms!

We're not against the soldiers,

we're against the war!

We're not against
the soldiers...

we're against the war!

Peace, brother.

We mean you
no harm.

We're not against soldiers,
we're against the war.

Not against the soldiers,
we're against the war.

That was really cool, man.
Hey, thanks.

Hey...!

Hey.

Just wanted to add
my praise to the chorus.

What you did today
was fantastic.

You kept a lot of people
from getting hurt.

Mostly, I was thinking
about one of them.

They would have
started clubbing people.

That's what they do!
I can't believe Kenny put you up front!

That was crazy!

It's not crazy.
It's what gets on the news.

What doesn't get on
the news doesn't count.

The proceeding has been
a paid political announcement

by Kenny Klein.

I truly believe
he's gonna change the world.

While you get
your heads kicked in!

That's not true.
He cares about people.

In the abstract, maybe.

You don't even know him!
I know guys like him...

they all love humanity
except face to face.

Are you crying?

I think it's tear gas.

I thought it was love.

Maybe it's just easier
for some people

to give themselves over
to a cause.

Sure, broken heads heal,
broken hearts -

I'm talking
about ideals, Michael!

No, you're just
talking about ideas.

I'm talking about people.
Two people.

Hey, baby,
what's happenin'?

He's got pneumonia.

Is little Rainbow
on a bummer?

Come to Mama Earth.
Come here, sweetheart.

I'll take him.
Thank you.

I need some money.
I don't think it's enough...

it's six bucks.
That's all you've got?

I know it's a drag,
but you can take it.

I thought you guys
had a lot of gigs.

We mostly play
for drinks.

I just bought that lid,
it's good stuff,

do you want
some of it?

No, I don't!
I need to get medicine!

That guy from KSAN
likes our stuff...

maybe we could
get money gigs from him.

Did you ever think about
getting a real job?

Are you gonna bum me out
over jobs again, Katie?

Oh, man... my shaman told me
to avoid all bad vibes.

...we've got
to fill these petitions

if we want to get McCarthy
on the ballot for Illinois.

Be polite, explain our
opposition to the war...

and don't freak out
the middle class.

Hi, I'm Amanda Stone,
Northwestern Students for McCarthy.

I got assigned to you guys.

Mike Herlihy, Loyola...
Mindy Twiss, Jake Stein...

University of Chicago...
John Denny, drop-out...

Political activist,
please.

Nice to meet you.

Your first time?
Yes, you've got a virgin here.

We'll be gentle.

Hi, my name
is John Denny...

and I wanted to talk
to you today about...

Eugene McCarthy, and why
he deserves your vote...

in the Democratic Primary.

Vote for Gene!
Would you mind doing my laundry?

Gimme that!
Come here, you.

I always imagined
something a little more

Jackie Kennedy
for my life.

You don't think she does
John-John's laundry?

Oh, I'm sure she does.

Wanna sign the petition?

Whatever it is...

you know what
your father would say.

What about what
you wanna say?

Or does that
not matter?

Of course it does.
But I've tried my whole life

to make our home
as pleasant as possible...

Not every issue
is worth fighting for.

This is for McCarthy.
To end the war...

to get Brian back home,
is that worth fighting for?

I'm home!

There's a letter
from Brian.

Listen to this.

"Dear Mom and Dad,
I hear the news on TV sounds grim.

Don't believe it!

This ain't a Hilton,
but I'm warm and dry.

Compared to what
Dad went through...

Khe Sanh's a walk in the park
on a sunny day!

See you all in
about six months...

Have you heard from Katie?

Love to all. Brian."

Did you hear that?
He's just fine.

What do you think of that,
"Mister Clean for Gene"?

What the hell is that?
My name.

I can see that.
On a McCarthy petition?

What the hell
is going on here?

You know, Bill,
you have your opinions...

and I respect
those opinions.

Even if I don't
always agree with them.

I expect you to show me
the same kind of respect.

Spare change?

Spare change...?

Used to be you could get
whatever you needed

right here on the streets,
not now, man.

It's gotten really weird,
really dark.


Used to be like,
somewhere over the rainbow.

Now it's just...
somewhere.

You have to be careful, man...
Spare change?

You gotta be really
careful because...

they're cuttin' the stuff.
It's... evil, man.

It's not for me...

I just need to get some money
to turn the gas back on...

and get some food 'cause
my baby's sick.

Spare change...?

Smile. Make nice.

you are truly beautiful.

What's this for?

A gesture of appreciation.

How much do you want
for a private show?

I already did my show.

I quit!


Rainbow, I'm gonna make you
a promise, okay?

But it's just between
you and me and God.

I'm gonna take this money and
find us a clean bed tonight.

Then I'm gonna find us a warm,
safe place to stay...

for as long as we want.
I don't know where...

but we are never gonna
spend another night

on a stranger's couch
or on the street. Okay?

I promise you that.
I swear to God.

Hey!!

It's okay... it's okay.
Shhh...

Don't cry, don't cry.
It's okay...


Who is it?
Mom? Mom, it's me, Katie.

Katie! Tell me,

for the Presidency
of the United States.

to live a long life...

Longevity has its place...

But I'm not concerned
about that now.

I just want to
do God's will.

And he's allowed me
to go up to the mountain...

And I've looked over and
I have seen the Promised Land.

I may not get there with you...

but I want you
to know tonight...

that we as a people
will get to the Promised Land!

I'm not worried about anything...

I'm not fearing any man.

of the coming of the Lord!

allow this to happen?

No!

want our school?

No!
Okay.

Our black brothers have already
occupied Harrison Hall.

Let's take
this school back, guys!

President Kirk.
Let's pay him a little visit.

Now this is an office
I can get some work done in!

"This is President Grayson Kirk,
I hereby resign.

Hold all my calls."

Yes! Presents for the family!

Here you go, kids.

Grayson himself...

Sherry, darling?

Yes, darling!

Sarah, I want you in charge of
the mayo committee.

The what?
Mayonnaise. We got people to feed.

Screw you!
No, this is a very important job...

You've got to keep it cool.

If that stuff spoils,
this whole strike is over.

This is a life-and-death
assignment!

liberated!


The news has arrived!

We want the university
to behave responsibly.

To act as a good neighbor!
Live up to the ideals

that have been the school's
primary franchise

since it was created in 1754!
That is hardly revolutionary!

What?

The Alumni Association
wants a list of demands.

They think they can help get
the administration to listen.

The Alumni Association?
I've got NBC out here.

The New York Times
wants a story.

Abbie Hoffman's
called three times.

SDS at Berkeley wants to
know what they can do,

the Alumni Association
will have to wait in line,

and to be honest,
so will you.

What? Do you have something
to say to the press?

What if I do?

That's really difficult
for you to imagine.

You think "mayonnaise"
is pretty much it for me?

I've been doing this
for a while too, Kenny...

Yes, I have
some things to say.

But no one gets a chance
to talk when you're around.

I don't have time
to talk about this... crap.

I've got that list
of demands from... who?

The Alumni Association.
Yeah, so...

Strike! Strike!
Strike! Strike!

our right to free assembly...

and the police
assaulted us!

down a great university...

we're here to build a greater one!

live in a mansion...

through unfair labor practices!

Have we ever.

care only about money.

infected our university,

has infected our
whole entire society!

are the only cure.

to do some kinda security.

to do that, man?

Michael Rainbow!
Pull into the barn.

Katie, welcome
to the Hog Farm.

Welcome home.

No refined sugars.
It tastes sawdusty at first.

But you'll get used to it.
Do you wanna help out?

I'm afraid I'm
not much of a cook.

There's sewing, cleaning,
pulling weeds... What?

Woman's work? I'm closer
to Chicago than I thought.

What do the guys
do around here?

They just do their thing.

You're tellin' me
you can't tell the difference

between 300 porta-potties
and 300 cucumbers?

Boy, those look good.

You okay?

I just realized that
I've been holding my breath

for the past three years.

I know... I know.
But our hero's home, now.

Everything's gonna be fine,
from here on in.

Hey, he's here!

The barriers that exist
between black and white,

the poor and
those more affluent...

blacks and whites,

Indians and
Mexican-Americans...

distrust in the United States

with compassion
and understanding...

Hello?
Hi, it's me. Michael.

Michael, hi.
It feels like it's been forever.

I saw that thing at Columbia.
That was... cool.

I can't believe
you actually saw that.

So I just wanted to touch base.
Everything good?

Yeah. Everything's great.
How about you?

Good.

So... did you see
Kennedy at the Garden?

No, I missed it.
That's too bad.

Are you coming here
for the convention?

I don't know.
It depends on school.

How's Kenny?

Okay.

I miss you, too. Michael.

I hope I can get there.

Bye.

Another nightmare.
He's back to sleep.

You think he's going
to be all right?

Yeah.

What happened to
"Clean for Gene"?

Decide you want your
vote to count?

That's radical.

How's Bri?
Good. He's good.

American people in general,
black people in particular,

take careful note of
the racist California legislature

now considering legislation
aimed at keeping

black people disarmed and
powerless at the same time

racist police agencies
throughout the country

are intensifying the terror,
brutality, murder

and repression
of black people.

I don't see why the Panthers
should go to Chicago.

The only issue they're
concerned with is the war.

That's not our issue.
It's everyone's issue.

Peace is where
the revolution starts.

It could change the
economy of this country.

Which is what
we are tryin' to do.

Brother, please!
Do you really think any whites

see peace in those terms?

I don't think they consider
the impact on blacks at all.

You're thinking that
blacks are only being colonized,

but it's everyone!
The whole country.

Besides, the convention
is big time,

we could use some
of that right now.

You'll get a chance
to meet Fred Hampton.

Speech! - Shhh!

I was a campaign manager,
I know what a difference

that kind of effort
and commitment makes.

I thank
all of you...

Now it's on to Chicago
and let's win there!

Kennedy! Kennedy!

and then lost his life.

How do I look?

Like the circus left town
and forgot the clown.

I'll take that
as a complement.

Hey, sweetheart...
Hi, Mom.

Who's your candidate
this week. Nixon?

If you keep it up,
that's what you'll get.

That what you want?
Not looking for a fight,

I just came to give
Bri a ride to the VA.

Hey, Bri! Why don't you
clean up and come with me?

It's kind of a circus,
but it's democracy in action.

It's what you fought for.

I need my appointment today.
Okay.

We are all under attack!

America has decided
to devour it's youth!

We will resist!
We will not participate

in America's "Children
for Breakfast" program!

("Chicago" playing)

Sarah, would you
do me a favor?

Make up a couple hundred
copies of these.

I thought we
already had these.

No. Somebody screwed up.
Thanks.

Hi, Kenny...
Hey, man.

Kenny!
Hi, Michael. Good to see you.

Sarah here?
Yeah, somewhere.

Bobby Seale? Kenny Klein.
Thanks for coming.

We're gonna
put you on, right?

Chairman Seale will only
be here a couple of hours.

He's agreed to lend Panther
support against the war...

we have to decide
when he speaks.

Kenny?
That's fine, just a second...

Mayor Daley won't
extend the park permit.

It expires at
11 o'clock.

Screw the permit!
We got bodies, lots of 'em.

This is supposed to be
a peaceful protest,

anything besides,
I'm gonna lose a set of liberals!

That is the point.

Who better to polarize the undecided
than a pig with a billy club?

You making a decision
that affects the welfare

of people who haven't
agreed to any such thing!

So we do nothing,
and let the Vietnamese wake up

to another day of
napalm and carpet bombing?

Maybe we should vote.
We don't have time,

you wanna tell these people
they can't do anything

about their government...
While you keep fighting,

who's stopping the war?

Brian, what're you
doing here?

Thought I'd catch a little
democracy in action.

Doesn't look that good.
You're exactly right!

You're a vet, right?
A voice we need to hear.

I'm gonna put you on first.
Follow me, Brian.

I don't know if
this is a good idea.

It's not an idea, just tell
the people what you know.

Brian, you don't want
to do this, do you?

Let's go, Buddy.

There are new voices
that must be heard.

The voices of
America's fighting men.

Here's someone who
would like to talk to you.

Sergeant Brian Herlihy.

I don't think
that we should...

(clears throat)

None of us want to be there,
I know that...

It's just hard
to explain very well...

My dad was a Marine,
so I thought I would...

I used to play
football here...

This was gonna just
be like another game.

Something we could win...

I didn't know when I went...

I didn't know
when I signed up that...

Man: It's all right, man!

The police department
in this country

shouldn't be subjected
to this abuse.

What are we coming
to as a society?

What are we coming
to as a country?

("Peace Frog" playing)

Michael!
Sarah!

I've been looking for you!
Is your brother okay?

Sarah, look out!
Get off me!!

You've no right
to be doing this!

The whole world is watching!

The whole world is watching!

The whole world is watching!

(Television reporter:)
"The whole world is watching",

chants the crowd
on the side.

Hey, bro'...

Where were you at?
Started out at Quang Tri...

worked our way to
the city of Hue.

Crazy...

Honest government in
the United States!

The first priority
foreign policy objective

...to bring an honorable
end to the war.

("Tuesday Afternoon" playing)

Hey, man, you want a kiss?
What?

You wanna get
out of this thing?

It's either you
or that guy right there.

I should have volunteered
two years ago.

You could get out
with flat feet, then,

now you just
show up and you're in.

So what do you think?
Next.

C.O. huh?
"C" stands for chicken, right?

Where's your draft card?
Burned it.

My brother died in 'Nam
for scum like you.

Mine, too.
They just haven't buried him yet.

Save your speeches
for your C.O. hearing.

Next.

Can you tell how attracted
I am to you right now?

I'm already
spoken for, "sweetie".

I appreciate
your candor.

Sarah Weinstock?
Federal Bureau of Investigation,

we're looking
for Kenneth R. Klein.

Excuse me?
Don't try to protect him.

I'm here
to see a friend.

If you receive information
pertinent to Mr. Klein...

give us a call.

Does Hoover teach you
to talk like that?

("Say It Loud,
I'm Black and I'm Proud" playing)

Kids, does food taste better
when it's served with a smile?

Yeah!

Didn't your daddy
teach you that in Greenwood?

You knew my father?
Heard tell of him.

Brothers like him
and John Lewis,

we're just carryin' on
were they left off.

Carry on, brother.
Feed the people.

You'll all get strong.

Sounds like something
my daddy used to say.

Ask him to give us a hand.
We could use the help.

How you kids doing?
Good!

Where's Huey?
In jail!

Who put him there?
The pigs!

What're we gonna do?
Free Huey!

Free Huey
Free Huey!

Free Huey!
Free Huey!

Just a few billion dollars
and we have someone

who can walk
like Howdy Doody.

Do you think you have
what it takes to go

where it's desolate,
uncharted...

and completely
uncivilized by man?

Yeah, I think
I can handle the moon.

I'm not talking
about the moon.

("Coming Into Los Angeles" playing)

How can I describe her?
You know the Dylan song,

"Just Like A Woman"?
That's what she's like.

"Everybody knows,
that baby's got new clothes...

But lately I've seen
her ribbons and her bows...

Come fallin' from her curls..."

I haven't sang that since
I was in a horehouse in Saigon.

Hey, man, you okay?
I don't know...

Seen my old lady?
She went that way, partner.

That way.
Far out. Thanks, man.

That guy's in worse
shape than I am.

Come on.
You gotta go?

Get into Woodstock.
How?

Up in the boonies.
My specialty.


Morning, people!

Bri... you okay?
Tryin' to decide bro'...

Whether to get straight
with some reefer,

or this brown acid
this lady gave to me.

Decisions,
decisions, decisions.

Hey, man!

I'm gonna get some food.

Hey... Hey, man,
have you seen my old lady?

You did?

Where?

(machine gun fire
jungle sounds)

Guys, we need
some help in here!

Okay, I got this one.

You okay? Okay, look...
you've taken some LSD...

and it's gonna wear off.

We got you.
We got you.

What's your name, man?
Brian.

Okay. Let's clean
this guy up.

Looks like you went overboard
with the makeup.

Mind if I clean you off?

You're gonna be okay,
all right?

My name is Brian...

My name is Brain.

Oh my God, Brian...?
Brian, it's me. Katie.

Oh, God!
Kit-Kat!

("The Weight" playing)

Brian, there you are!
I've been looking for you.

Katie...!

I can't believe it!

Hey, who's this?
Michael.

Michael...?
Uh-huh.

My name's Michael, too.

Mother:
Bill, who is it?

It's the kids.

Honey...!

I missed you so much,
my sweet girl.

Who is this?
It's Michael Rainbow.

Michael Rainbow,
I'm your Grandma Mary...

and I intend to
spoil you rotten!

Will you come inside?
Will you come in?

("Five To One" playing)

TV Announcer: The riot conspiracy
trial of the Chicago Seven

continued today after a night
of bitter street fighting...

between the radical Weathermen
and the local police.

Nice room.
Courtesy of the Columbia Spectator.

From Art History
to Journalism!

It's the Chicago Seven trial,
I had to see it for myself.

Think of the fun we had
the last time we were in Chicago!

Mayor Daley. Swell host.

Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

How's Kenny?
That's not my favorite topic.

That's good to hear.

Shrimp. I remember tuna at
Berkeley and now shrimp...

There's a seafood theme
in our relationship.

You want it?

Sarah, I just don't think
I'm the only one here who knows

we're destined for each other!

You know it, too.

So what's wrong?

You know the kind of relationship
I've been in for the past few years.

Yeah. Shallow and meaningless.
I'm serious.

When I spoke at Columbia...

...that was me.

That was my voice...

I can't give that up, Michael!
I don't want to be a shadow!

That's not what I'm about,
I don't want a shadow...

you must have me confused
with somebody else!

I'm a mess.
I'm not much good to myself.

I'm not going to be any good
to anybody else.

What I need more than anything
else right now, is a friend.

A... a friend...?

A friend.

Let me give you a little
friendly insight... friend.

The problem is...

It wasn't real with Kenny,
he just kept you busy.

With me, it's real, and you
don't wanna deal with that!

You don't have to go.

Yeah, I do.

I've loved you
for a long time, Sarah...

and I think I have to give up.

Don't give up.
Why?

Because...

"She breaks just like
a little girl".

Bye, Sarah.

I don't know whether to stay here
or go back to Oakland.

You came to your consciousness
out of the Oakland scene.

Huey and Bobby took a militant
stance to establish the party.

They also started a roots thing,
workin' in the community.

For me, that's most important.
That's what I grew up with.

Why are you having such
a difficult time figuring out

which way to go?

Lemme tell you something...

you're not gonna find your way
back to your papa with hatred.

Hatred will fool you.

Trick you into looking
for the cop who killed him...

Trick you into
looking for any cop.

Trick you into looking
for any white man.

Come the end of the day,

you won't be
any closer to your father.

("Season Of The Witch" playing)


Sarah.

Here. Take a hit?

Note said you were desperate, Kenny.
What do you want?

What do you think I want, Sarah?
Princess?

I would have sent you a check.

Who you gonna make it out to?
Kenny Klein doesn't exist.

He was sacrificed
for the movement.

I'm a cash and carry
enterprise now.

How long since you've
gotten any sleep?

Eye on the prize.
Remember, Sarah?

What? Extorting dope money
from old girlfriends?

That money is for the movement!

If the movement needs to score
a lid, the movement knows best.

Remember Blake...

"The tigers of wrath are wiser
than the horses of instruction."

Remember Ginsberg...

"I saw the best minds of my
generation destroyed by madness."

What happened to you, Kenny?

You weren't just my boyfriend,
you were my teacher.

I believed in you.

But now...

...you're a joke.

Michael was right.
You never cared about people...

you only cared about ideas,
now you don't have any ideas left.

Michael...

Hold it!

I don't know if
I can let you leave...

I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to kill ya.

I'm just goofin' ya.

Run away,
my little bourgeois princess!

It's me, Daddy.

I should have come before...

but I couldn't find my way.

I guess I was blinded by hate.

I want you to know,
I miss you...

and I hope you can see
all that I'm up to now.

I'm sure for the first time
you'd approve.

Pray for me, Daddy.

Who's hungry?

Does food taste better if
he serves it with a smile?

Yeah!

I said, does the food taste
better served with a smile?

Yes!

All right. We got oatmeal.

(Bill humming)

Hey!
You want a beer?

I was thinking about a verse
from the Marines hymn...

You know this one?
"If the Army and the Navy...

Ever gaze on Heaven's scenes...

They will find the
streets are guarded by...

the United States Marines."

God, I hate that song.

Dad, look at me...

That was another time...

I'm what war looks like now.

Brian, you risked your life
for another man's freedom...

that's a noble thing.

Dad, why the hell were we
there in the first place?

We didn't even know who
the enemy was.

So maybe you didn't like what
you saw when you got there,

but you don't get to pick and
choose your battles.

I'm proud that when your
country called, you went.

And I hope this war hasn't
destroyed the honor of that!

This is the wrong war
for your principles.

Son...
Principles are principles.

That's all a man has.

You've been asking
me questions all morning.

I've tried my best to answer...

but there are
some you haven't asked.

Why are we slaughtering men,
women, and children in Vietnam?

Why are we burning cities,
bombing villages,

and lying to the
American people about it?

Why have 40 thousand soldiers
given their lives?

I've tried to answer
these questions, and I can't.

Nobody else has, either.
Unless I can answer these questions...

I can't justify fighting
an illegal and immoral war!

I have to decide what I believe.

Peace is preferable to war.

Love is better than hate.

And I believe
this war is wrong.

Anything else?

Yes.

I'd like to say something
on my brother's behalf.

No need for that, Brian...

Some of you guys know me.
You know my son, Michael,

but I don't think you really
know him.

I barely know him myself.

When he was a kid,
he was good...

kind, and gentle.

He never believed hurting anyone
was the way to win.

I thought he might
become a priest.

I don't know what a
conscientious objector means...

but I do know what a conscience is,
and my son has one.

If his conscience
tells him he cannot fight...

it's not because he's
not brave enough to fight...

but because he's brave enough
to stand up for what he believes in.

That's how I raised my kids,
that's how you raised yours.

And I hope you're as proud
of them as I am of my son.

Michael.

Dad.

Now you're talkin'.

How's my boy today?
So far, today's a good day.

Here you go.

Katie...?

Peace.
It's not that easy, Dad.

What can I say, Katie?
What can you say?

That you're sorry you
sent me off to have a baby

when I was just a baby myself.

That you understand that you
made me feel completely worthless

when I needed you more
than anything?

There are a lotta things you can say.
But you have to say them.

I'm... l'm sorry, Katie.

Are you still my baby?
No, Dad. I grew up.

But I'm still your daughter.

Hello? Hello?

Knock - knock?

Who's there?

Buddy, wow!
Katie, gosh, you look so good!

Thanks, you look good, too.
Thanks.

Mr. H, what happened
to the Cubbies?

Don't mention that.
Hey, think fast.

Still got the hands.

Set! - Hike!

It's good to see you.
Good seein' you, Brian.

Grab this guy a beer!
Hey, Buddy...

Hey, Mike, how are you?
All right.

Hey.

What is it?

It's a side of lox.

It's that seafood thing again.

So much for the ice breaking.

You could make this
just a little easier.

I don't wanna be too easy.

What do you want?

I want you.

What do you want?

Mike, what happened to
those beers...?

This must be Sarah.
Hey everybody, you've gotta meet

the love of Michael's life,
Sarah Weinstock.

Weinstock? What is that?
Is that an Irish name?

Hey, Weinstock...
Go long.

Here you go...

All right! Nice catch.

Nice girl.

Good tight end.

All right everybody,
Weinstock's on my team. Let's go!
