[WIND HOWLING]

COME ON, KEVIN.

<i>[MAN #2]
MY NAME IS JASIN. </i>

<i>I ENTERED IMMORTALITY
100 YEARS AGO. </i>

COME ON, KEVIN.
STICK HIM, KEVIN.

MOVE YOUR FEET.
JAB HIM OFTEN.

<i>I HAVE CREATED A COVEN. </i>

<i>I HAVE FOUND MY CHOSEN ONE. </i>

<i>TOGETHER WE LIVE IN PEACE </i>

<i>AMONGST THE PEOPLE
OF LOS ANGELES. </i>

JAB, KEVIN. JAB.

COME ON, KEVIN.
MOVE YOUR BUTT.

GET OUT OF THERE, KEVIN.

JAB HIM BACK.
JAB HIM BACK, KEVIN.

JESUS, COME ON, KEVIN.

JAB HIM, KEVIN.
THAT'S IT, KEVIN.

BACK HIM UP, KEVIN.

<i>[MAN #3]
MY NAME IS DEMETRIUS. </i>

<i>I, TOO, ENTERED IMMORTALITY </i>

<i>NEARLY 100 YEARS AGO. </i>

COME ON. STICK HIM, KEVIN.

WHAT THE...

<i>[DEMETRIUS]
I'VE COME TO LOS ANGELES </i>

<i>LOOKING FOR MY MAKER </i>

<i>AND HIS CHOSEN. </i>

JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH,

WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
WITH THIS KID?

WE'VE GOT TO TEACH HIM
HOW TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
HIS DADDY'S PAYING US FOR.

YOU HIT ME
WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING.

NEVER TAKE YOUR EYE
OFF YOUR OPPONENT.

I TOLD HIM A MILLION TIMES.

I THINK THIS KID LIKES
WALKING DOWN QUEER STREET.

I DON'T GO THAT WAY.

THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOUR DADDY THINKS.

THAT'S WHY HE SENT YOU HERE.

IT'S A BOXING TERM, FUCK NUT.

IT MEANS YOU'VE BEEN HIT
IN THE DOME ONE TOO MANY TIMES.

LISTEN. WHY DON'T YOU GET
OUT OF HERE.

YOU TAKE THE WEEKEND OFF.

I'LL SEE YOU
BACK AGAIN ON MONDAY,
ALL RIGHT?

CAN I AT LEAST TAKE
A SHOWER FIRST?

LISTEN. I'D LIKE TO GET OUT
OF HERE IF YOU DON'T MIND.

YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK UP A BAG
OF ICE ON YOUR WAY HOME.

OH, THANKS.

YOU, TOO, VINNY.

WHAT? I DIDN'T GET HIT.

NO, YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

I'LL CLEAN UP TONIGHT.

YOU SURE, BOSS?

WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

YOU DON'T GOT TO TELL
THIS FOOL TWICE.

<i>HASTA MAÃ‘ANA, BITCHES. </i>

I'M GOING TO CATCH
THE 10:00 FIGHT.

HEY, KEVIN,
WHERE'S YOUR BIKE?

I DROVE.

FUCK THE BUS.

I'M GOING WITH YOU, BUDDY.

COME ON.
HEY.

GET OUT THERE.

<i>MY NAME IS JASIN.
I AM A VAMPIRE. </i>

<i>WE ARE SEEKERS OF PEACE. </i>

[SLOW CLAPPING]

DEMETRIUS,
I KNEW YOU WERE CLOSE.

I RECOGNIZED YOUR SCENT.

HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

I SMELLED YOU FIRST.

TO THE SHOWERS, MY FRIEND.

JASIN, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

I'M FINE.
I'M SORRY I WOKE YOU.

ALL RIGHT,
ANOTHER BAD DREAM?

NO, JUST A FEELING.

SOMETHING LIKE--

LIKE WHAT?

LIKE YOU'RE GOING
BACK TO SLEEP.

YOU STILL HAVE CLASS
IN THE MORNING.

YES, DAD.

I LOVE YOU, JASIN.

I KNOW.

WHAT'S HAPPENING?

SO YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
WITH A GIRL BEFORE.

HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN INTERESTED?

I GUESS.
IT JUST NEVER CAME UP,
REALLY.

YEAH?

AREN'T YOU CURIOUS?

MAYBE.

WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

UH, WE CAN GO INTO THE BUS.

BACK THERE?

BUT WE'LL GET IN TROUBLE.

MY UNCLE KNOWS
THAT WE'RE HERE.

YEAH, BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

YOU'RE SUCH A BABY.
COME ON.

AMBER?

HEY, BOY,
MAMMA WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

[DOG BARKING]

<i>â™ª DOCTOR, DOCTOR â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª I FEEL IT IN MY CHEST â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª IN MY CHEST â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª THAT YOU'RE A MONSTER â™ª </i>

HEY, COME ON, CHICKEN.

<i>â™ª WOKE UP WITH
BLIND EYES A WIDE â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª THE WAY YOU POSSESS MY MIND â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª YOU JUMPED INTO MY SIGHT â™ª </i>


<i>â™ª OH I CAN'T WAIT â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª TO TAKE YOU TONIGHT â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª OH, I READY FOR THIS-- â™ª </i>

WHY DID YOU HAVE TO PICK
SUCH A CRAMPED SPACE?


<i>â™ª S.O.S. â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª SEND ME A DOCTOR â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª DOCTOR, DOCTOR â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª I FEEL IT IN MY CHEST â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª THAT YOU'RE A MONSTER â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª MONSTER, MONSTER â™ª </i>

<i>â™ª I DON'T KNOW

[DOG BARKING]

WAIT.
WHAT?

I'M JUST GETTING INTO THIS.

NO, SOME--
SOMEONE'S HURTING AMBROSE.

THE DOG.
I HEAR THE DOG BARKING.

[BARKING CONTINUES]

[DEEP MALE VOICE]
STAY ON THE BUS.

I SAID STAY ON THE BUS.

THE BACK.

THERE'S NO DOOR.

SHE'S GONNA DIE!

AMBROSE!
AMBROSE!


AMBROSE!

[DOG WHIMPERS]

AMBROSE! AMBROSE!
AMBROSE! AMBROSE!

MISSING SOMETHING?


NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A PARTY.

WHAT DID YOU DO TO AMBROSE?

YOU KILLED MY DOG.


WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY DOG?

I THINK YOU HAVE SOME IDEA
WHAT I DID TO YOUR DOG.

OH, MY GOD.

BOTH OF YOU, LOOK AT ME.

I SAID LOOK AT ME.

MUCH BETTER.

MY NAME IS DEMETRIUS.

WE ARE HERE BECAUSE
I'VE CHOSEN YOU TO FIGHT.

ONE OF YOU WILL BE ALIVE
BY THE END OF THIS EVENING.

YOU WANT A GIRL TO FIGHT--


SHE'S GOT A SPARK,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

NO, WE WON'T DO IT.

YOU THINK YOU HAVE A CHOICE
IN THIS MATTER.

EITHER YOU FIGHT OR YOU DIE.

FIGHT...

OR DIE.

WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT.
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

SO BE IT.




VERY DISAPPOINTING.

WE STILL HAVE SOME TIME.

WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

FOR LOVE OF EACH OTHER.


THAT IS SOMETHING YOU AND I
HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED.

OUR HUMAN LIVES WERE
VERY DIFFERENT FROM THEIRS.

YEAH? WELL,
LOOK WHERE THAT GOT THEM.

LOVE.

LOVE.

I FEAR IT IS SOMETHING
OUR LEADER

GREATLY UNDERESTIMATES.

YOU WERE GOOD, JUDAH,

MUCH BETTER THAN WHEN YOU
LEFT THE COVEN YEARS AGO

WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A WORD.

DEMETRIUS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE,

BUT TAKE A LOOK AROUND YOU.

THIS ISN'T THE 17th CENTURY
ANYMORE.

I'M A BUSINESSMAN.
I RUN A BUSINESS.

YOU KNOW WHO COMES
IN HERE EVER WEDNESDAY NIGHT

JUST TO GO A FEW ROUNDS
AND BLOW OFF SOME STEAM?

THE GOD DAMN VOICE
OF FRED FLINTSTONE.

YOU WANT TO WATCH HUMANS
FIGHT TO THE DEATH,

WHY DON'T YOU GO BUY YOURSELF
A 40-INCH AND A ZBOX

AND KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

YOU TRULY ARE HALF A VAMPIRE.

ALL THESE YEARS AND YOU HAVEN'T
TASTED HUMAN BLOOD?

WELL, I GUESS I'M LUCKY
THAT LIVE NEAR A LAKE

WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF DEER.

VAMPIRES CANNOT LIVE ON DEER.

YEAH, WELL, I ENJOY
AN OCCASIONAL BEAVER.


SOME OF US DO.

YOU TRULY ARE FORTUNATE,
JUDAH.

FORTUNATE?
I CONSIDER THIS A CURSE.

OUR MAKER TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF OUR LOSS,

AND WE'VE BEEN LIVING
IN THE DARKNESS EVER SINCE.

SOME OF US CHOOSE
TO SEE THE LIGHT.

AND IT'S FUNNY
THAT YOU MENTION OUR MAKER.

HE'S SORT OF THE REASON
WHY I'M HERE.

OUR MAKER WAS KILLED A YEAR AGO
BY A NEW WARRIOR COVEN.

ALL BUT THREE OF THEM
WERE LEFT SLAUGHTERED.

MAYBE YOU'RE ONE OF THE THREE.

YOU'RE A BUSINESSMAN.

LET'S TALK BUSINESS.

FINE, LET'S TALK BUSINESS.

WHAT DO THE WINNERS OF THIS
LITTLE CONTEST OF YOURS RECEIVE?

ETERNAL LIFE.

YOU WANT TO TURN HUMANS
INTO VAMPIRES.

WHY?

I'M CREATING AN ARMY.

JASIN AND HIS COVEN--
NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THIS.

SO YOU'VE MET THEM.

I'VE HEARD OF THEM.

WELL,
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD,

JASIN IS THE HEAD VAMPIRE
IN THE CITY OF ANGELS.

WHEN I CAME HERE
TO START A NEW LIFE,

HE WELCOMED ME WITH OPEN ARMS

AND HE LET ME LIVE IN PEACE.

HMM, HOW PEACHY.

YOU HAVE TO PUT THIS REVENGE
BULLSHIT BEHIND YOU.

IF MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT,

YOU'RE COMING UP
ON YOUR CENTENNIAL YEAR.

I WOULD THINK
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE

MORE PRESSING MATTERS
TO ATTEND TO,

PERHAPS FINDING YOUR CHOSEN.

AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT I HAVEN'T?

MY TWO ASSOCIATES
ARE OUT NOW, AS WE SPEAK,

FINDING MY FIRST TWO CONTENDERS.

DO WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING?

YOU'RE OUT
OF YOUR FUCKING MIND.

OOH, SUCH COLORFUL LANGUAGE,
JUDAH,

AND THIS COMING FROM SOMEONE
WHO WANTED TO BECOME A PRIEST.

YEAH, WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?

DO WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING?

AND WHAT IF I REFUSE?



KEYS ARE IN MY FRONT DESK.

YOU SUCKER-PUNCHED ME.

YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW, JUDAH.

NEVER TAKE YOUR EYES
OFF AN OPPONENT.

YOU LOOK GOOD, COUSIN.

YOU'VE DONE WELL FOR YOURSELF.

DON'T GO.

JASIN.

[DOG BARKING]

[BARKING CONTINUES]

A CONNECTION WAS MADE
HERE TONIGHT.

HE SAW WHAT HAPPENED?

I CAN'T BE SURE
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAW,

BUT HE DEFINITELY SENSES
MY PRESENCE.

[DOG BARKING]

WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

WHAT HAPPENS NOW

IS WE BUILD
OUR COVEN.

WELL, I REALLY HOPE
THAT ALL HUMANS

ARE NOT LIKE THE TWO

THAT WE HAD TONIGHT.

NEITHER OF THEM WOULD
HAVE BEEN AN ASSET TO US,

BUT I DO UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERN.

IN ORDER TO AVOID
A REPEAT PERFORMANCE,

YOU TWO WILL FIND
TWO COMPLETE STRANGERS.

IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

GOOD.

NOW YOU TWO HAVE
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

WE ARE THROWING
A FIGHT TOMORROW,

YOU FILL FIND TWO
WORTHY CONTENDERS.

WE WILL NOT FAIL YOU.

WE WILL NOT FAIL YOU.

GOOD.

NOW I HAVE ANOTHER
TASK TO COMPLETE.

OH, AND THIS TASK...

SHE GOT A NAME?

TARA.

MORNING, GORGEOUS.

WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

I WAS JUST THINKING
HOW NICE IT IS

NOT TO HAVE TO WASH
DISHES ANYMORE.

YEAH, WELL THAT'S ONE
OF THE PERKS OF BEING DEAD.

FUNNY.

HOW ARE YOUR CLASSES
GOING, SMARTY PANTS?

NOT TOO BAD,
I STILL DON'T KNOW

WHERE I'M GOING, I MEAN,
BEING A VAMPIRE AND ALL.

WELL, YOU DID COME TO CALIFORNIA
TO GO TO SCHOOL, RIGHT?

THE VAMPIRE PART
OF IT WASN'T PLANNED.

YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

BUT I WOULDN'T
CHANGE IT FOR ANYTHING.

I MEAN, MEETING JASIN
HAS BEEN THE BEST THING

THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

TARA, I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T...

I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

IT'S OKAY.

THE PAST IS THE PAST.

I'VE REALLY ENJOYED
HOW MY LIFE HAS CHANGED

OVER THE LAST YEAR.

YEAH, ME TOO.

WELL, WE BECAME VAMPIRES
THE SAME NIGHT, RIGHT?

I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER
BE ABLE TO FORGET
THAT NIGHT.

ME EITHER.

COMPLETELY CHANGED
OUR LIVES.

IF IT WEREN'T
FOR THAT MOMENT,

WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO ME.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

JASIN CHOSE YOU
AS THE ONE.

IF LOGAN WOULDN'T HAVE
TURNED ME,

I SUPPOSE I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN WELCOMED TO STAY,

BEING MORTAL AND ALL.

JASIN WOULDN'T HAVE
ABANDONED YOU.

I WOULDN'T HAVE LET HIM.

I'M REALLY HAPPY YOU
AND I HAVE GOTTEN CLOSER.

YEAH, ME TOO.

GOOD MORNING.

SO WHAT HAVE YOU
TWO BEEN TALKING ABOUT?

OH, JUST OLD TIMES.

YOU TWO HAVE ONLY KNOWN
EACH OTHER A YEAR.

HOW OLD COULD THESE TIMES
ACTUALLY BE?

CALEB, AREN'T YOU
GOING TO BE LATE FOR CLASS?

OH, SHIT.

I GOTTA GO.
BRING YOUR BOOK.

ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

SEE YA.

BE GOOD.

I ALWAYS AM.

YOU ARE REALLY LUCKY
TO HAVE FOUND HIM.

TARA, SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED
IN THE PAST YEAR.

YOU AND I NEVER REALLY GOT
A CHANCE TO TALK
ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

THERE'S NO NEED.

CALEB WAS THE TRUE
CHOSEN ONE.

I DON'T BLAME HIM
OR YOU.

PROMISE.

I FEEL AN EXPLANATION
IS IN ORDER.

PLEASE.

LET'S JUST PUT IT
BEHIND US.

SO, WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT PLANNED FOR THE DAY?

I WAS THINKING I'D START THE
DAY OFF BY GOING SHOPPING,

THEN MAYBE GETTING
A PEDICURE

AND THEN I THINK
I'LL COME BACK HOME,

GRAB THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG

AND SUCK THE LITTLE FUCKER DRY.

YOU HEARD HIM BARKING?

ALL FRICKIN' NIGHT.

I GUESS THAT WOULDN'T BE
SUCH A BAD THING.

SEE YA AFTER A WHILE.

ENJOY YOURSELF.

OH, WHAT WAS THAT?
LIKE TEN MILES?

12 I THINK.

WHAT TIME YOU GOING
INTO WORK TODAY?

I WAS THINKING OF CALLING
IN A PERSONAL DAY.

OH YEAH?

YOU HAVE SOMETHING GOING ON?

I WAS KINDA HOPING YOU'D CALL
IN A PERSONAL DAY TOO.

YEAH, I THINK THAT
COULD BE ARRANGED.

DID YOU HEAR
THAT?

JUST THE TREES, RIGHT?

MAYBE WE SHOULD START
HEADING BACK.

THOSE TWO HAVE NO LOVE
FOR EACH OTHER.

ONLY FOR THEMSELVES.

WHAT'S THE RUSH?

EXCUSE ME?

I SAID, WHAT'S THE RUSH?

IT'S SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUTSIDE.

WE WERE JUST LEAVING.

SPOILING ALL THE FUN
THAT WE COULD BE HAVING.

LOOK, I'M SURE
YOU'RE COOL AND ALL

BUT ME AND DARREN
AREN'T INTO ANYTHING WEIRD.

HOW DO YOU KNOW,

IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED?

STOP!

COME HERE.

THERE'S NO
GETTING AWAY, BOYS.

YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

OH, YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

WHAT THE FUCK?

OH!
I'M SO SORRY.

THAT'S OKAY, I WASN'T PAYING
ATTENTION EITHER.

I'M DEMETRIUS.

I'M SORT OF NEW
IN TOWN.

TARA. PLEASURE TO BUMP
INTO YOU.

I'M SORRY.

ALLOW ME
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

I KNOW A COFFEE SHOP
AROUND THE STREET.

TOO FORWARD?

JUST A LITTLE.

WELL, IT WASN'T REALLY
MY INTENTION

TO MAKE
THIS UNCOMFORTABLE.

NO, IT'S OKAY.

I'M JUST NOT USED
TO SUCH POLITENESS.

THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO BLAME
MY MOTHER FOR THAT.

SHE ALWAYS TAUGHT ME
TO TREAT SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

WITH ADMIRATION AND RESPECT.

AGAIN, I'VE MADE
THE SITUATION AWKWARD.

NO, NOT AT ALL.

THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE
THE COMPLIMENT.

THEN SHALL WE?

I SUPPOSE IT COULDN'T HURT,
COULD IT?

I PROMISE,
IT'LL BE PAINLESS.

SOMETHING BOTHERING
YOU, JASIN?

WHY'D YOU HAVE US MEET YOU
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

I THOUGHT THAT CALEB'S HOUSE
BECAME OUR NEW OFFICIAL HIDE.

THERE'S SOMETHING I WANTED
TO DISCUSS WITH BOTH OF YOU.

I'D RATHER NOT HAVE
THE OTHERS HEAR ABOUT.

I WAS AWOKEN LAST NIGHT
BY A VERY STRANGE...DREAM,

FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD.

IT WAS VERY POWERFUL.

VERY DARK.

I THINK THERE MIGHT BE
ANOTHER VAMPIRE BROOD.

OTHERS LIKE US.

I CAN'T BE SURE.

BUT THERE WAS A CONNECTION
IN THE DREAM

AS IF SOMEONE WAS
REACHING OUT TO ME.

YOU SAID IT WAS DARK.

YOU COULDN'T SEE
WHAT WAS HAPPENING?

THERE WERE TWO MEN KILLED.

AND THERE WERE OTHERS
LURKING IN THE SHADOW,

AS IF TRYING TO CONCEAL
THEMSELVES FROM ME.

OTHER VAMPIRES, LIKE US.

NO, ADAM, I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE ANYTHING LIKE US.

I JUST HOPE
THAT I'M WRONG.

SO, TARA, TELL ME
ABOUT YOURSELF.

MYSELF, HMM.

WELL, IN A NUTSHELL,
I'M SORT OF THE TOMBOY,

TREE CLIMBING, CAR RACING,
GUNS AND AMMO KIND OF GIRL.

GUNS AND AMMO.

YEP.

I CAN ALSO THROW
A MEAN KNIFE.

SO I BETTER NOT
GET YOU ANGRY WITH ME.

GOOD THING.

SO THIS MORNING YOU WEREN'T
EXACTLY WIELDING KNIVES.

NO, JUST OUT
FOR A LITTLE RETAIL THERAPY.

THERAPY?

I'M TRYING TO ERASE
AN OLD MEMORY THAT CAME BACK

TO HAUNT ME THIS MORNING.

I'M SORRY.

YOU HAVEN'T DRUNK
ANY OF YOUR COFFEE.

OH, I GUESS I'M JUST NOT--

NOT IN THE MOOD.

MAYBE, I SHOULD HAVE
ORDERED THAT LATTE.

MAYBE YOU JUST
CAN'T DRINK IT

FOR THE SAME REASON
I CAN'T DRINK MINE.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEAN.

YOU HAVEN'T SENSED IT YET?

SENSED WHAT?

THE CONNECTION.

TARA, I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

NO, DON'T GET UP.

I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE
OF MY OWN KIND IN YEARS.

YOU'RE A...

VAMPIRE?

FOR NEARLY 100 YEARS.

HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS?

BECAUSE, I SENSED
YOUR PRESENCE.

ACTUALLY, I SENSED
OTHERS AS WELL.

WHY WASN'T I ABLE
TO SENSE YOU?

HAVE YOU TAKEN
YOUR FIRST HUMAN YET?

NO, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO BRING MYSELF TO DO IT.

WELL, THEN YOU'RE A FLEDGLING.

YOU'RE MOSTLY HUMAN.

WHEN YOU TAKE
YOUR FIRST HUMAN LIFE,

YOU'LL BE A TRUE VAMPIRE.

WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME?

I'M SORRY, WHO
DIDN'T TELL YOU?

YOU'RE RIGHT.

I AM PART OF A COVEN.

THERE ARE MORE OF US
HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

HOW MANY MORE?

BESIDES MYSELF,
THERE'S CALEB, DANE,

ADAM, AND OF COURSE JASIN.

JASIN, IS HE YOUR MAKER?

ARE YOU HIS CHOSEN?

NO, HE IS NOT MY MAKER.

I WAS TO BE HIS CHOSEN,
BUT HE FOUND ANOTHER.

I'M SORRY.

I'VE MOVED PASSED IT.

CALEB IS A GREAT GUY.

JASIN IS REALLY LUCKY
TO HAVE FOUND HIM.

IS CALEB
JASIN'S CHOSEN?

YES.

WE'VE ALL BEEN TOGETHER NOW
FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

EVER SINCE THE NIGHT
BOTH CALEB AND I WERE CHANGED.

WOULD YOU DO ME THE HONOR
TO MEET YOUR COVEN?

I WILL TELL HIM ABOUT YOU.

EXCELLENT.

HOW WILL I GET
IN TOUCH WITH YOU?

WITHOUT TRUE VAMPIRE POWERS

IT WILL PROVE
RATHER DIFFICULT.

OR I COULD JUST GIVE YOU
A CELL PHONE NUMBER.

OF COURSE.

I LOOK FORWARD
TO YOUR PHONE CALL.

NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME

I HAVE A RATHER BUSY MORNING.

IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, DEMETRIUS.

NO, THE PLEASURE
IS ALL MINE.

MAYBE WE CAN DO
THIS AGAIN.

OVER COFFEE.

I KNOW A GREAT PLACE.

TRY NOT TO CRASH
INTO ANYBODY.

I'LL DO MY BEST.

CONGRATULATIONS.

SHE'S THE BREAK YOU'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR.

SHE'S A FRAGILE ONE.

SHE'LL BE EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

NOAH, WOULD YOU
DO THE HONOR

OF WAKING
OUR GUESTS?

GET UP.

OH, WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?

I DO NOT RECALL
ASKING YOU TO SPEAK.

LOOK, WHAT DID YOU
DO TO US?

DID YOU ASSUME
PERHAPS THAT

I WANTED
TO HEAR FROM YOU?

DO NOT SPEAK UNLESS
YOU ARE SPOKEN TO.

NOW YOU ARE HERE

FOR ONE REASON
AND ONE REASON ONLY.

I AM BUILDING AN ARMY.

YOU TWO ARE GOING
TO BE FIGHTING.

THE WINNER
BECOMES A VAMPIRE.

THE LOSER, WELL,

THE LOSER WILL DIE.

YOU CAN'T MAKE US
DO THIS.

I CAN MAKE YOU DO
WHATEVER I WANT.

NO HUMAN WITH HALF A BRAIN

CAN TELL ME OTHERWISE.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

NOW, ONE OF YOU
WILL BE GRANTED

ETERNAL LIFE
AND THE OTHER--

THE OTHER WILL DIE.

NO!

[GRUNTS, THUDS]

WELL, THAT WAS
COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED.

I THINK HE'S DEAD.

YOU THINK?

NOW FIND ME
ANOTHER OPPONENT.

NOW!

AT THIS HOUR?

HEY, JUDAH, I JUST CAME
TO STOP BY TO GET MY--

OH, SHIT!

HE'LL DO JUST FINE.

DEMETRIUS, NO.

WHAT'S HE
TALKING ABOUT?
NOTHING.

I'VE LET YOU USE MY GYM,

I'VE TURNED MY BACK
ON EVERYTHING

THAT'S BEEN
GOING ON IN HERE.

I'VE NOT SAID ONE WORD
TO JASIN AND HIS COVEN.

THERE'S NO WAY
IN HELL

I'M GOING TO LET YOU
FIGHT THIS BOY!

CIRCLE.

KEVIN, KEEP MOVING.
CIRCLE.

KEVIN, KEEP MOVING.

KEEP MOVING.

REMEMBER WHAT I
TAUGHT YOU.

REMEMBER WHAT I
TAUGHT YOU.

VINNY, GET OUT OF HERE.

JUST FORGET
EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN.

LEAVE AND DON'T COME BACK.
[KEY HITS FLOOR]

THAT'S ENOUGH.

YOU'VE PROVEN
YOURSELF TO ME.

AND YOU'VE SHOWN ME
THE STRENGTH OF MIND

IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE STRENGTH
OF THE BODY.

TAKE YOUR PLACE
IN MY ARMY.

NOW FEEL THE HUNGER,

LET IT CONSUME YOU.

NOW, FEED.

NO.


I NEVER IN MY
WILDEST DREAMS

WOULD HAVE
WANTED THIS FOR YOU,

BUT YOU MADE ME
PROUD TONIGHT.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I WANT YOU TO TOUCH ME.

KEVIN, YOU HAVE
BEEN ETERNALLY

FROZEN AT 22.

I WAS YOUR TEACHER.

I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO BE YOUR FATHER.

JUST LIKE MY FATHER,
YOU FUCKING TALK TOO MUCH.

NO.

[DOG BARKING]

SUCH A BEAUTIFUL,
SUNNY DAY.

I'M SO GLAD
THAT MYTH ABOUT

VAMPIRES IS NOT TRUE.

YES, TO ONLY LIVE IN DARKNESS
WOULD BE THE TRUE CURSE.

THOUGH I DO MISS
MY MORNING COFFEE.

ORANGE JUICE.

BREAKFAST BURRITOS.

OH, WELL. SMALL PRICE TO PAY

FOR ETERNAL HAPPINESS, HUH?

JASIN, WHAT'S A FLEDGLING?

A FLEDGLING?

WHERE DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT THAT?

I'LL GET TO THAT,
BUT WHAT IS IT?

YEAH, WHAT IS THAT?

A FLEDGLING IS A YOUNG VAMPIRE

WHO HAS NOT YET TASTED
HUMAN BLOOD.

SO, IS THAT
WHAT WE ARE THEN?

YES.

I HAVE NOT PUSHED YOU
TO TAKE HUMAN BLOOD

BECAUSE I FEEL
YOU'RE NOT READY.

SO WE STILL HAVE
MOSTLY OUR HUMAN SIDE.

YES.

AREN'T YOU GOING TO BE LATE
FOR CLASSES?

YEAH, I'M GOING,
I'M GOING.

I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

BYE.

SO WHERE DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT THIS?

YESTERDAY, I MET
ANOTHER VAMPIRE.

HIS NAME
IS DEMETRIUS.

HE'S NEW HERE.

DEMETRIUS, IS HE ALONE?

HE SEEMED TO BE.

HE SAID HE
WAS INTERESTED IN

MEETING YOU
AND THE OTHERS.

YOU TOLD HIM
ABOUT US?

YES, HE SAID HE
HASN'T BEEN

AROUND OUR KIND
IN YEARS.

A DRIFTER,
LIKE OUR FRIEND, JUDAH.

I TOLD HIM I'D TALK
TO YOU ABOUT HIM.

HE SEEMED
SOMEWHAT LONELY.

I WILL GLADLY MEET HIM.

I'LL SET IT UP.

I'LL BE MEETING
HIM SHORTLY.

GOOD, YOU JUST TELL ME
WHEN AND WHERE.

MAY I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

OF COURSE.

WHY...

WHY WAS I NOT
THE ONE?

TARA, I CAN'T
GIVE YOU A REASON

THAT WILL MAKE
SENSE TO YOU.

YOU MUST UNDERSTAND
THAT I STILL CARE
A GREAT DEAL FOR YOU.

I COULDN'T
IMAGINE MY LIFE

WITHOUT YOU BEING
A PART OF IT.

GOOD THING I
CAN'T CRY ANYMORE

OTHERWISE MY MAKEUP

WOULD BE ALL OVER
MY FACE.

I LOVE YOU, TARA.

THERE'S ALWAYS
GOING TO BE A SPECIAL PLACE

FOR YOU IN MY LIFE
AND IN THIS COVEN.

WHAT MORE COULD
A GIRL ASK FOR?

TALK TO THIS DEMETRIUS

AND SET UP
THE MEETING.

IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

IT IS NOT.

THANK YOU.

DON'T MENTION IT.

IT'S ALL JUST
FOR SHOW, RIGHT?

THAT IT IS.

SO WHAT IS ON
YOUR MIND TODAY?

WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?

THE WOMAN WHO TAUGHT YOU
SUCH GOOD MANNERS.

I WOULD LIKE THAT.

SHE WAS AN AMAZING WOMAN.

THE MOST GENTLE WOMAN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

THE DOCTOR
WAS A VAMPIRE?

YES.

AND HE TURNED YOU
THE DAY YOUR MOTHER DIED?

WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
TARA?

YOU DON'T THINK
HE WAS THE CAUSE

OF YOUR MOTHER'S
SICKNESS, DO YOU?

I MEAN,
WERE THERE OTHERS?

MANY.

MY COUSIN'S MOTHER
PASSED AWAY

TWO YEARS LATER,

UNDER THE SAME
CIRCUMSTANCES.

HE WAS ABOUT TO ENTER
THE SEMINARY

WHEN SHE CAUGHT THE FEVER.

IS HE NOW A VAMPIRE?

A FLEDGLING, LIKE YOU.

YOU ARE A VERY
PERCEPTIVE WOMAN.

SO NARAN CREATED
HIS COVEN

THROUGH SUFFERING
AND LOSS

WHICH HE
HIMSELF CREATED.

THAT'S TERRIBLE.

I'M SORRY
YOU HAD TO GO--

THERE'S MORE.

HE CREATED ME
TO BE HIS CHOSEN

AND THEN LEFT ME
FOR ANOTHER.

I GUESS THINGS
JUST DON'T LAST FOREVER.

NO, I SUPPOSE
NOTHING DOES.

I WOULD HAVE MADE YOU
MY CHOSEN.

I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

I'M ONLY SPEAKING
THE TRUTH.

OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

I SPOKE TO JASIN.

HE WANTS TO MEET YOU.

HE INVITED YOU
TO OUR COVEN.

WHEN?

TONIGHT.

TELL HIM TO MEET ME
AT MIDNIGHT.

I WILL.

NOW IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND

AS TO ACCOMPANY ME
TO A DRINK LATER?

TWO DATES IN ONE DAY.


YES?

A PEN.

OH, SURE.

MEET ME HERE AT 9:00.

OH, REALLY?

I WAS TALKING TO THE LADY.

I'LL BE THERE.

IT APPEARS MY
PREMONITION WAS CORRECT.

THERE'S ANOTHER VAMPIRE
AMONG US.

IS HE DANGEROUS?

I CAN'T BE SURE.

HE HAS SOUGHT OUT TARA.

TARA.

SHE MET HIM YESTERDAY.

SHE'S WITH HIM AS WE SPEAK.

APPARENTLY HE'S LOOKING TO MEET
OTHERS OF HIS KIND.

HE WANTS TO MEET WITH ME.

WE'LL COME WITH YOU.

I APPRECIATE THAT, ADAM.

I THINK HE WANTS
TO MEET WITH ME ALONE.

I'LL BE FINE.

IF YOU NEED US,
JUST SUMMON US.

WE'LL BE THERE.

YOU BOTH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
VERY LOYAL TO ME.

THAT DOES NOT GO UNNOTICED.

NOW, I HAVEN'T TOLD CALEB
ABOUT THIS YET.

I WANT TO KNOW
WHO THIS VAMPIRE IS

BEFORE I INTRODUCE
HIM TO OUR COVEN.

YOU KNOW, WE'LL
NEVER LET ANYTHING

HAPPEN TO CALEB.

I AM CONFIDENT OF THAT.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

DEMETRIUS, ARE YOU HERE?

DEMETRIUS?

I STARTLED YOU.

YES.

I'M GLAD YOU CAME.

I'M ALSO VERY PLEASED
THAT JASIN HAS AGREED
TO MEET ME.

HE WILL MEET YOU TONIGHT
AT MIDNIGHT.

RIGHT NOW HE AND CALEB

ARE SPENDING
THE EVENING TOGETHER.

EXCELLENT.

THAT WILL GIVE US
TIME TO TALK.

SO, THIS CALEB.

HE IS THE CHOSEN?

YES.

HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

YOUR ETERNAL SOULMATE

HAS CHOSEN ANOTHER

AND PASSED YOU UP.

DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW?

I THOUGHT YOU INVITED ME
FOR A DRINK,

ALTHOUGH THERE DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE A BAR.

MY APOLOGIES.

I KNOW THAT THIS TOPIC...

DOESN'T PLEASE YOU.

HOWEVER,

I KNOW YOUR PAIN
ALL TOO WELL.

IT EATS
AT YOU EVERY DAY.

EVERY TIME YOU SEE THEM KISS.

AND IT EATS YOU.

I THINK I'M
GOING TO GO NOW.

WHY?

WE'RE JUST HAVING
A CONVERSATION.

I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

BETWEEN JASIN
AND I.

EVERYTHING IS AS
IT SHOULD BE.

TARA, I FEEL YOUR PAIN.

WILL YOU LET GO
OF MY ARM?

I'M NOT HURTING YOU,
AM I?

YOU'RE FRIGHTENING ME.

MY APOLOGIES.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

YOU I CAN'T LET
YOU LEAVE JUST YET.

THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
THAT JASIN HAS DESTROYED

ONE'S DREAMS OF
HAPPINESS,

BUT IT WILL BE
HIS LAST.

I WANT TO GO NOW.

AND TELL JASIN?

WHY?

WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

I BROUGHT YOU HERE
TO SHOW YOU MY ARENA.

MY COLISEUM, IF YOU WILL.
WHAT?

THERE'S GOING
TO BE A FIGHT,

AND I'VE CHOSEN YOU
TO REPRESENT OUR KIND.

WHAT IS THIS?

ME FIGHTING?

I'M SORRY BUT IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

BUT IT WILL HAPPEN.

WHAT? WHO THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO--

YOU'RE CRAZY.

YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

YOU'RE GOOD
AT WIELDING KNIVES.

THAT WILL SERVE YOU WELL.

YOU WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH

AND THE WINNER
WILL BE MY CHOSEN.

I WON'T FIGHT, CALEB.

HE WILL
MAKE IT EASIER.

<i>[DEMETRIUS]
YOU ARE BECOMING ONE OF US. </i>

<i>YOU ARE ONE OF US NOW. </i>

<i>NOW YOU MUST FEED TO COMPLETE
THE TRANSFORMATION. </i>

I WAS INTRIGUED TO HEAR OF
ANOTHER VAMPIRE IN TOWN.

STRANGELY I COULD NOT
DETECT YOUR PRESENCE.

HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN IN LOS ANGELES?

I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

SEARCHING FOR OTHERS
LIKE US.

ACTUALLY, WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED

I STUMBLED UPON A COVEN.

A COVEN?

YES, BELIEVE IT
WAS YOURS.

I WAS HUNTING DEER
WHEN I HEARD SOME VOICES

IN THE CLEARING.

WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

[VOICE 2]
ARE YOU SURE?
WITH ELO?

I MOVED QUIETLY TOWARDS THEM.

SPEAKING OF WAITING...

A YOUNG LADY WAS SEDUCING
TWO YOUNG MEN.

MY MEN?

NO, THEY WERE HUMAN.

BUT IF I RECALL,
ONE OF THEM WAS HER BOYFRIEND.

THE YOUNG LADY ASKED THEM
TO REMOVE THEIR CLOTHING.

DID THEY AGREE?

WHY WOULDN'T THEY?

IT WAS A VERY
HOT DAY.

STILL,
SHE WANTED THEM TO KISS.

SOON THEY ALL WERE.

THEN ALMOST AS QUICKLY
AS IT BEGAN,

THE VAMPIRE BOYS
SHOWED UP.

THE VAMPIRE BOYS?

THAT'S WHAT I CALLED THEM.

OF COURSE I WAS NEW IN TOWN

AND I THOUGHT IT BEST
NOT TO STICK AROUND.

I LOST THEIR TRACKS.

I'VE BEEN SEARCHING
FOR THEM EVER SINCE.

UNTIL YOU RAN INTO TARA.

LITERALLY.

SHALL WE?

FUNNY, HOW YOU'VE GONE
COMPLETELY UNDETECTED

FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.

IT'S A BIG CITY.

YES.

WHEN WERE YOU CHANGED?

I WAS MADE NEARLY 100
YEARS AGO.

MY MAKER WAS AN ELDER VAMPIRE,

HE DISAPPEARED DECADES AGO.

I HAVEN'T SEEN MY MAKER EITHER.

HMMM.
HE WAS KILLED A YEAR AGO.

I'M SORRY.

I KNOW THIS PLACE.

JUDAH AND I ARE COUSINS.

DON'T WORRY, HE HASN'T BEEN
KEEPING ANYTHING FROM YOU.

I FOUND HIM THE SAME TIME
I FOUND YOU.

DO YOU INTEND TO STAY
IN LOS ANGELES?

I THINK SO.

I KIND OF MADE A PLAN
FOR MYSELF HERE.

REALLY?

WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU?

NOAH, TYLER, KEVIN.

AS YOU SEE, I'M NOT ALONE.

KEVIN IS OUR NEWEST MEMBER.

HE'S ONLY BEEN A VAMPIRE

SINCE YESTERDAY EVENING.

BUT HE SHOWS
SO MUCH POTENTIAL.


FOR DECADES
I WAS ALONE.

MY MAKER LEFT ME
FOR ANOTHER.

I WAS DEVASTATED.

I WAS TO BE HIS CHOSEN.

I UNDERSTAND HOW
YOU MUST HAVE FELT.

MY MAKER LEFT ME
AS WELL.

IT CAUSED YEARS
OF DEPRESSION.

I WANTED HIS COMPANIONSHIP.

AS DID I.

BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT

OR WHY YOU'RE HERE.

WHO ARE YOUR ASSOCIATES?

THIS IS NOAH.

HE'S BEEN WITH ME
FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS.

WHEN I FOUND HIM,

HIS BODY WAS SO POLLUTED
WITH HUMAN DRUGS...

HE WAS NEARLY DEAD.

AND THEN TYLER.

WE FOUND HIM TOGETHER.

HE WAS AN ORPHAN
ALL HIS LIFE.

HE'S GOT SUCH
WONDERFUL GIFTS.

HE CAN SEE INTO
THE FUTURE.

THE NUNS
THAT HOUSED HIM

SAID THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE
ETERNAL LIFE. [LAUGHS]

NOW WE PROVED THEM WRONG,
DIDN'T WE?

SO YOU'RE BUILDING
A COVEN?

WHERE ARE YOU
FINDING YOUR RECRUITS?

PLEASE, ALLOW HIM
TO SHOW YOU.

YOU'RE KIDNAPPING HUMANS.

WATCH.

THIS IS BARBARIC.

AND WHAT YOU
VAMPIRE BOYS DID

TO THOSE THREE LOVERS
WAS HUMANE?

I CHOOSE
STRONG HUMANS.

THEY DECIDE WHO
LIVES AND WHO DIES.

I WANT THE STRONGEST VAMPIRES
FOR MY COVEN.

ENOUGH!

TO WHAT PURPOSE, DEMETRIUS?

WHY ARE YOU BUILDING
THIS COVEN?

OUR MEETING HERE
IS OVER.

I HAVE MUCH WORK
TO DO.

YOUR WORK HERE
IS DONE.

YOU AND YOUR COVEN
HAVE 24 HOURS TO LEAVE.

AND WHAT IF WE
DECIDE TO STAY?

THEN PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR BATTLE.

NOW IT'S TIME TO ATTACK.

UM, BOSS, NOT TO POINT OUT
THE OBVIOUS

BUT WE ONLY HAVE
TWO NEW VAMPIRES.

I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU WANTED MORE.

I HAVE A NEW PLAN.

I'M NO LONGER
GOING TO KILL JASIN.

I WILL BREAK HIM.

TYLER!

COME!

[WATER RUNNING]

I'M SORRY.
I MISJUDGED YOU.

AS ONE HYBRID
TO ANOTHER,

YOU HAVE MY WORD,

I WILL DO
WHAT YOU ASK.

FIRST I WANT TO SEE
YOU ONE LAST TIME.

MEET ME IN THE CLEARING
AT NOON TOMORROW.

YOU HAVE
AN IMPRESSION OF ME

WHICH I WOULD LIKE
TO CORRECT.

AFTER, ALL THINGS
WILL BE SETTLED BETWEEN US.

YOU HAVE MY WORD.

ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

THERE'S A NEW VAMPIRE COVEN
IN OUR CITY.

I'VE MET THEM.

OTHERS LIKE US?

WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

THEY'RE NOTHING LIKE US.

I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE

I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THIS VAMPIRE

COULD BE NO THREAT
TO US.

AND?

DEMETRIUS IS SOMEONE
WHO CANNOT BE TRUSTED.

I HAVE ASKED THAT HIM
AND HIS COVEN LEAVE.

THEY'VE BEEN USING HUMANS
TO BATTLE ONE ANOTHER.

THE WINNER IS MADE
A VAMPIRE.

DEMETRIUS WANTS
TO CREATE AN ARMY.

HE'S BUILDING AN ARMY?

WHY?

HE DIDN'T SAY.

BUT I'VE AGREED TO MEET
WITH HIM ONCE MORE, TOMORROW.

YOU AREN'T MEETING HIM
BY YOURSELF.

WHAT IF HE TRIES
TO DO SOMETHING?

NO HARM CAN COME TO ME,
DON'T WORRY.

YOU CAN'T
PROMISE ME THAT.

WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ADAM
AND DANE WITH YOU?

OR BETTER YET,
DON'T GO.

ALL HE HAS TO DO
IS SUMMON US,

WE'LL BE THERE.

HELL, YEAH.

UNTIL THEN, I'M THINKING
ABOUT HUNTING.

GO.

YOU'RE BEING VERY QUIET
THIS EVENING.

I'M WORRIED.

WHAT IF THIS DEMETRIUS
TRIES TO--

HE WILL TRY NOTHING.

I PROMISE YOU.

JASIN, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO
GODDAMN HARD HEADED?

I THOUGHT YOU'D GOTTEN
USED TO THAT BY NOW.

WELL, I HAVEN'T.

JUST BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

I AM ALWAYS CAREFUL.

I KNOW.

I LOVE YOU.

I LOVE YOU.

[BIRD SHRIEKS]

I'M GLAD YOU AGREED
TO MEET ME ONE LAST TIME.

I'D NEVER TURN MY BACK
ON ONE OF MY OWN KIND.

EVEN IF I DON'T APPROVE
OF WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING.

FAIR ENOUGH.

YOU I HAVE MISJUDGED.

YOU ARE TRULY
A VAMPIRE'S VAMPIRE.

I ALREADY HAVE A LOVER,
DEMETRIUS.

I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO GET JERKED OFF.

TELL ME WHY YOU WANTED
TO MEET WITH ME.

I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT JUST THAT.

YOUR LOVER CALEB.

HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT HE WAS THE ONE?

I DON'T RECALL
MENTIONING THAT NAME TO YOU.

TARA?

AND HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WAS HIM,

AND NOT HER?

IT WAS SOMETHING I KNEW
TO BE TRUE.

I HAD A CONNECTION
WITH HIM

THAT I DID NOT HAVE
WITH TARA.

I TOO HAD A CONNECTION
WITH MY MAKER.

I WAS TO BE THE ONE.

WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

HE WAS AN ELDER
VAMPIRE, OBVIOUSLY,

CHANGED ME

AND CONVINCED ME
THAT I WAS THE ONE.

SO HE PASSED YOU BY
FOR ANOTHER?

YES.

DON'T GO.

PLEASE STAY.

DON'T GO!

MY LIFE, MY WORLD,

EVERYTHING CAME
CRASHING DOWN.

DON'T GO.

I EVEN CONTEMPLATED
ENDING MYSELF.

THE REJECTION
WAS TOO PAINFUL.

I COULDN'T BRING
MYSELF TO DO IT.

I WASN'T EVEN SURE
IF I WOULD DIE.

I KNEW SO LITTLE

OF WHAT I'D JUST BECOME.

SOMETIME LATER
I SAW HIM AGAIN,

WITH HIS NEW LOVER.

IT WAS YOU, JASIN.

NARAN WAS YOUR MAKER

AND YOU KILLED HIM.

NOW YOU'VE COME TO SEEK
YOUR REVENGE AGAINST ME?

I WANNA HURT YOU
LIKE YOU HURT ME.

I DIDN'T KNOW OF YOUR
EXISTENCE, DEMETRIUS.

NARAN ALSO LEFT ME.

IF YOU'VE COME FOR REVENGE,

WHY DO YOU NEED AN ARMY?

TAKE IT NOW.

NOT NOW.

NOT THAT EASY.

SHE'S RETURNING.

I'M SURE SHE'S FED.

I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT.

DID YOU DO IT?

GOOD.

WHAT'S WRONG?

SHE WAS PICKING UP HER SON.

HE'S AUTISTIC.

SO THE KID CAN PAINT.

BIG DEAL.

SO YOU'RE BOTH
FROM THE SAME MAKER?

APPARENTLY SO.

AND HE LEFT
DEMETRIUS FOR YOU.

IT'S BEEN EATING HIM
UP ALL THESE YEARS.

WE SHOULD ALL
BE ON ALERT.

TRUE THAT, BROTHER.

I IMPLORE EACH OF YOU TO BE
MINDFUL YOUR SURROUNDINGS

AND KEEP YOUR SENSES SHARP.

EVEN A BIG GUY LIKE YOU.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

I'D LIKE YOU TO STAY
IN THE HOUSE.

YOU THINK HE'LL COME
AFTER ME.

I JUST WANT TO BE
EXTRA CAUTIOUS.

BESIDES, I NEED SOMEONE

TO STAY AND LOOK
AFTER TARA.

TARA, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

SHE'S FINE.

SHE JUST NEEDED A REST.

I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.

I'M GOING OUT TO LOOK
FOR JUDAH,

FIND OUT
WHAT HE KNOWS.

WELL, WE'RE
COMING WITH YOU.

I LOVE YOU
BOTH DEARLY.

WE'LL BE BACK SOON.

I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE
COME TO US JUDAH,

BUT I THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CANDOR.

IF YOU THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE

THAT MIGHT BE A HELP
TO US,

YOU KNOW WHERE
TO FIND ME.

UNTIL THEN
THIS FIGHT CLUB

IS OFF LIMITS
TO EVERYONE,

INCLUDING YOU.

I UNDERSTAND.

JASIN, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING.

YES?

THEY'VE TURNED TARA
AGAINST YOU.

SHE'S WITH
DEMETRIUS NOW.

CALEB.

HOW'D IT GO?

TARA, MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU
PRIVATELY PLEASE?

SURE.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

ADAM WILL EXPLAIN.

ADAM?

JASIN WANTS YOU TO GO
INTO HIDING.

SO GRAB YOUR STUFF,
LET'S GO.

WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, JASIN?

I JUST SPOKE WITH JUDAH.

REALLY?
HOW IS HE?

NOT GOOD.
NEITHER WAS I

AFTER HE GAVE ME
SOME INFORMATION.

WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION?

HE TOLD ME YOU'RE
WITH DEMETRIUS NOW.

REALLY?

NOW, WOULDN'T THAT
BE A SCANDAL?

IS IT TRUE?

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON

AND STOP
PLAYING GAMES.

COVEN AND I LOVE
PLAYING GAMES.

WE'RE ASSEMBLING ONE
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

ADAM! DANE!

THEY'RE NOT HERE.

NEITHER IS CALEB.

WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THEM?

WHERE DID YOU TAKE THEM?

COME WITH ME
AND YOU'LL SEE.

CALEB!

RELEASE HIM,
DEMETRIUS.

IN GOOD TIME.

WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

I SAID WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

THEY WERE ON TO US.

WE WERE BARELY ABLE
TO GET THIS ONE.

SOMEBODY MUST HAVE
TIPPED THEM OFF.

JUDAH.

FIND THEM!

WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

GET THEM!

STAY IN THIS SPOT
OR CALEB DIES!

STAY WHERE YOU ARE, JASIN!

YOU'RE A TRAITOR,
OLD MAN.

KEVIN, THIS IS
NOT YOUR FIGHT.

LEAVE NOW AND YOU
CAN LIVE YOUR LIFE IN PEACE.

WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS WILL END, DEMETRIUS?

DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOUR THIRST FOR REVENGE

WILL BE SATISFIED?

I'LL HAVE MY REVENGE,

AND TONIGHT, I WILL
LEAVE HERE WITH MY CHOSEN.

WE'RE STRONG.

THEY'RE STRONGER.

I'M TIRED OF THIS,
OLD MAN.

LET'S DANCE.

WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU FORGOT HOW TO FIGHT?

THE MAIN EVENT
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

YOU KNOW MY MONEY
IS ON TARA.

I'M NOT GONNA FALL
FOR THAT TRICK, OLD MAN.

I'M SORRY, JUDAH.

YOU THINK YOU'VE WON?

PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR THE MAIN EVENT.

NOW!

DANE, STAY BACK!

WHY, WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO?

FIGHT HER.

I'M NOT GOING TO FIGHT TARA.

THEN HE DIES.

CALEB, LEAVE
THIS PLACE NOW.

AND HAVE YOU KILLED?

CALEB, GRAB THE BLADE.

CALEB, YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

I'M SORRY, JASIN.

I LOVE YOU.

CALEB, NO.

NO!

I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

WHY ARE YOU SO LOVED,

AND I SO HATED?

YOU AND I SUFFERED
THE SAME PAIN, DEMETRIUS,

AND WE FOLLOW
DIFFERENT PATHS

TO DEAL WITH IT.

I CHOSE FORGIVENESS.

I FORGIVE YOU, DEMETRIUS.

BE CAREFUL, MY FRIEND.

I ALWAYS AM.

AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE BOYS HERE.

I'LL KEEP A GOOD EYE
ON THEM.

I'M COUNTING ON THAT.

WELCOME TO OUR
COVEN, JUDAH.

HEY, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING

WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

THANK YOU, ADAM.

YOU AND DANE
MEAN MORE TO ME

THAN I CAN EXPRESS.

I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.

BE WELL, ALL OF YOU.

LET'S GO.

COME BACK TO US SOON.

YEAH, DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO!

WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

SOMETIMES I JUST THINK
YOU'RE HALF HORSE.

YEAH, THE LOWER HALF.

LET'S GO GET SOME FIREWOOD.

DO YOU THINK DEMETRIUS

WILL EVER FIND PEACE
WITH HIMSELF?

I HOPE SO, TARA.

WHAT HAPPENS IF HE
EVER DECIDES TO COME BACK?

THAT WILL DEPEND
ON HIS MOTIVES.

I HOPE WE CAN WELCOME HIM
AS A FRIEND.

SOMEHOW I SERIOUSLY
DOUBT THAT.

YOU NEVER KNOW.

LOVE CONQUERS ALL THINGS.

LET US TOO SURRENDER
TO LOVE.

DID YOU WRITE THAT?

THE POET VIRGIL
IN 42 BC.

DID YOU KNOW HIM?

VERY FUNNY.

"LET US TOO SURRENDER
TO LOVE."

I LIKE THAT.

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

TO SURRENDER.

DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO.

DID I STARTLE YOU?

YES.

DON'T BE AFRAID OF ME.

DON'T EVER GIVE ME
A REASON TO BE.
