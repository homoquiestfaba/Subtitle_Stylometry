Thank you Ray

He's a real wise ass this one

Thank you Ray

I can handle it from here

Well...

You know, you may have gotten away
with this sort of behavoir in

the New York City school system

but I can assure you that we will
not tolerate it here at Mayfield

Look Mr. Vogel I didn't...

But Mr. Vogel nothing

Mr. Slater, you've already gotten
off on the wrong foot here

and I can further assure you that

if you do not straighten up
and fly right

the only school that you will be
attending will be reform school

Sir I'm really not a bad guy
once you get to know me

Look, it's obvious I've been
framed for something I didn't do

Ah, yes, that is just what the
owner of this said

And he is now doing, oh let's see

5 to 7 years
in the state penitentiary

thanks to my diligence

Sir, you got me all wrong

All right. have it your way

Perhaps a little detention will
give you the opportunity to

consider your future here
at Mayfield

Let's say 3 weeks

3 weeks, for what?

You know, you're right
let's make it 4 weeks

But Mr. Vogel I...

One more word and it could be five

What the hell is...

Security report to the yard
immediately please

You sit down right there
and wait for me young man

Yes sir

Shit

He}! YOU guys freeze

Shit

Piece of cake

Take it inside
Round up the strays

We're here for a while

What do you people think
you are doing here?

Anything we want

My god. Are you the proprietor of
this establishment?

Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me

I asked you a question

Yes, I'm the principal

Good, looks like we'll be here for
a while and we require

some hospitality

What do you want?

What we need is cooperation
and that means

you only speak when
you are spoken to

Now turn around and walk

I'll get Boomer

Quickly

Attention all students, faculty
and personnel still in the building

Please report at once to
the assembly hall

This is an emergency

Please everyone go to
the assembly hall

This is not a drill

Now the police

Tell them to keep their distance
or we start throwing out corpses

Young teenage corpses

Hey Stacy, what do you say we
hang out here for a little while?

But they said it was an emergency

It's probably just a fire drill
or something

I don't know

Oh come on, I'll protect you

Oh yeah, and who's going to
protect me from you

Me?
Yeah

If you can't trust me
who can you trust?

Stacy, come on

I'll meet you there

Yeah, come on Betty
you and me babe

Cool

Just stay calm Mr. Vogel

we'll get you out of this mess
all right

Give them whatever they want

Ok

They won't release their demands
until the FBI gets here

Get me a perimeter set up
I want a SWAT team

Get me fire department
bomb squad, EMS

What about the press?

No, no, leave them out of this
till we know more ourselves

ls your boy still in there?

Not likely no
not after school hours

Jesus

I thought this is where you come
to get rid of this kind of crap

in your life

Guys, guys, hey listen to me

Don't go near the assembly hall
all right?

You got to help me to get everyone
together and get them

out of the building

Eat shit dirtbag

Listen to me man

We still ain't finished with you
city boy

Fine, fine, let's go outside

I'll let you kick my ass

Just let's do it outside huh?

You woos

Faggot

Let's go boys and girls
to the assembly hall

Let's cut come on, let's cut
All right, all right

Come on, we haven't got all day

Let's go

Hey man, something bad is cooking

Sit

Boomer, phase one

Yes sir

Check for stragglers

Now that I have your attention

You all have the great opportunity
today to be a part of history

in the making

Now you can either sit back and
enjoy it

or watch it face down in a pool
of your own blood

It's your choice

Makes no difference to me

Damn

I shouldn't have bought that
second milk

Who was that?

Who cares, they're gone now

Come on Eddy
let's get out of here

The girls are going to be
wondering where I'm at

Then let them wonder

You know I do have a reputation
to think of here

Yeah, so do I

Wait, did you here that?

Sounds like sirens, listen

Will you come on

Listen

Chief Slater

What options are you taking
to apprehend the terrorist?

We're considering all our options

What about the hostages?

That's our priority

Is it true the terrorists have
possession of the new top secret

missile guidance system?

Yes, I'm sure they have the
atomic bomb too

Now please, just let us
do our jobs okay?

The warehouse at Greenville
we've got reports that

that's where it was stored

Do you?
Chief is it true

you were one of
the officers

in the
World Trade Center bombing?

That's a matter of record

Is it also true that your son is
a student here?

Well, if it isn't Leonard

Guys, you've got to get out of
here right now

So it was you in the locker room
wasn't it?

Hey me and you got some unfinished
business Broncs boy

I told you, my dad told me
not to fight girls

You son of a bitch

Aiming problem again eh?

That's it man

That is it. You are dead

Do me a favor will you
chill your boyfriend out all right?

We've got to do something to get
out of here right now

Hey, you're not getting out of it
this time city boy

He's not my boyfriend
Forget that all right

We've just got to get out of here

Wait, wait
what are you talking about?

What am I talking about?

I'm talking about a half dozen
heavily armed dudes who blew away

a cop and that sorry ass security
guard Ray

I'm also talking about some bitch
they got with them

Some crazy bitch who almost blew
my head off when I was

in Vogel's office taking the rap
for your boyfriend's little

peeping Tom stunt

That was you?

I don't know what
he's talking about

You son of a bitch

Forget that now

We just got to get out of here

Hey, hey, wait a minute

I'm not going anywhere till I know
what the hell's going on

What, you don't trust me?

No

Yeah, well then I dare you
to follow me

Come on

Come on tough guy

All right fine, let's go

I want snipers on the rooftops
there, there and there

Tell them to report any movement

My men can pick of anything
within 500 yards

Well that's all we need
dead bodies in the school yard

I don't want heroes Hawkins
I want hostages all right?

Shooters are a last resort

Whatever you say chief

Any word?

Nothing

Want me to call the feds again?

Yeah, find out what's keeping them

Well except for the
Empire State Building

I'd swear I was back in New York

Chaos, potential for bloodshed

At least there I can
get a good cup of coffee

Yes?

Excuse me sir
I have to go to the bathroom

Wait

You have to make some kind
of arrangement for them

Shut up

Number one or number two?

Number one

You may go in the corner

That's the last of them

Boomer

Yes sir

Phase two

Yes sir

Shit, you're right

It looks like they've got some
kind of bomb or something

Whatever it is it ain't good

What now genius?

You just get out of here
while you got a chance

What about you?

There's a gun in Vogel's office

What are you crazy?

Those dudes have machine guns

I can see that guy

I think we should call
the police guys

That's a good idea

A really good idea

Chances are they're probably in
the dark about what's going on

in here

You're nuts

I'm getting the hell out of here

You go ahead if you want to

I want to help

Fine come help

Wait, wait, wait
what is with you people?

Come on

FBI will be here soon

Good

He put it in a desk or drawer
somewhere

Call 9110k?

Shit

What?
The bastard left the mike on

I'll get him

Shut up

Speak

This is police chief Slater
I have FBI agents

Doogan

Doogan and

Du mford

Du mford

Put them on

This is special agent Doogan FBI

Ah, a woman, I like that

You're very perceptive

Who am I talking to?

That's unimportant

What is important is that you call
your men out of this building

or I start throwing dead teenagers
out the window on time for

the six o'clock news

You got anybody in there?

No, of course not

We don't have anyone in there

You wouldn't lie to me would you?

You got anybody
pulling a cowboy act?

My men follow my orders
I follow yours

We have no one in there

I give you my word

Very well, I guess I'll just have
to take care of it on my end

Now don't do anything rash

We're here to make a deal

What the hell is it you want?

0k, listen closely, because I'm
only going to say it once

We are in possession of enough
explosives to level this entire

building and everyone in it

I get the picture

Get to the point

Right now they are strategically
placed and armed for maximum impact

We have several hostages

Just imagine what they would look
like if we were to detonate

I couldn't agree with you more

Now what do we do about it?

Oh, it's very simple

First we require the
federal government to completely

disband and dissolve all its
military, law enforcement and

bureaucratic agencies

Second, all assets and arms
in possession of these agencies

shall be turned over to our cause
the Free Peoples Militia

for distribution to their
rightful owners

namely the American tax payers

We have a loony on our hands

You can't be serious

Does the term dead serious
ring a bell?

Now I suggest you get started

You have 2 hours or you're going
to be sifting through debris

scattered over a 3 mile radius

Oh and don't try anything foolish

The slightest sign of aggression
and I will automatically detonate

without further discussion

Wait, hello, hello

Damn

Anybody seen what
they took in there?

The rumor is they have
a big crate

Four of them carried it in

It's big enough

If you have any bright ideas
now would be a good time

How long to break the code?

Well, it's more sophisticated
than I thought

2, maybe 3 hours

You got 2, make it work

There's still some strays
wandering the halls

I want them found

Now

Come on

Shit

That's it man

That is it

I'm out of here

Let's go

He's right

How far do you guys think
you're gonna get huh?

I've seen these guys shoot ok

They don't miss

And what do you think you're
gonna do? Stop them?

Shit

Great

Broncs boy here is gonna fight
them off with an empty gun

Let me tell you something
loud mouth all right

It doesn't take much to get in to
fights in the Broncs

The real talent comes from getting
out of fights with a good bluff ok?

I don't know guys

What are we gonna do?

What are we gonna do?

0k, just chill ok, relax

Just get back in the can
stay there and be quiet

Look I might be scared
but I'm not gonna

go hide in the bathroom

All right fine

What about you?

What are you gonna do?

0k, what's your plan asshole?

Follow me

There's someone else, find him

You got it

They bought it

And Boomer?

He's got 2 hours

He better figure it out

He's supposed to be the best

He'd better be

Hey, I tell you man
we searched the whole school

Yeah, but we're not going back
till we check it twice

Listen, we can do this a lot
better if we split up

That's a good idea

Why don't you take this floor

You take the basement
I'll take the first floor ok?

Let's go.
Got you

Dude, what are you doing?
That's gas

I know just let me show you
Just help me

Are you crazy man.
Come on, just do he says.

Let's go
Stacy, get those, get those

Let's go...

Come on man

Stacy get in here, get in here

Let's go

Come on

Let's go

Eddy man, you got a cigarette?

Why?

Just give me one

Come on, hurry up, give him one

Come on
All right, all right

Got a light?

Would you like me to smoke
it for you too?

Just give me a light man

I want every call going in and
out of that building monitored

right through here

And get me the local utility
company and the lines

Cut off the electricity pronto

Got it

How good are your sharp shooters?

That's taking a chance

Ok

You cut their power
flush them outwith tear gas

and cut them off one by one
as they come out the door

Outstanding ma'am

W0, wo, wo, Miss Doogan

It's Agent Doogan

Yes, of course it is

You do remember that the bad guys
have hostages in there?

Yeah
I figure a 33 to 48 percent loss

I can live with that

Really?

How sad for you

oh?

Your from New York aren't you?

No, not originally, no

I like happy endings and if we
don't get in there

If they blow up that school
you could be looking at

100 perecnt loss

Precisely my point

What is it you suggest we do?
Give in to his demands?

I suggest you think with your
heart not just with your badge

One body bag is going to be one
too many for the parents of

those kids

Let's get them all out

He's not gonna do what
I think he's gonna do

Shh

He's gonna do it

Watch it

Let's go, come on

Come on
Let's go, let's go, let's go

Mayfield power, can I help you?

This is the Mayfield police

I need to speak to whoever
is in charge

That will be Mr. Johnson

One moment while I connect you
to his office

Not now, wait! Wait!

Mr. Johnson's office

This is detective Worshak
of the Mayfield PD

I'm calling for Mr. Johnson

One moment please

Detective Worshak on 3

Detective, what can I do for you?

Sir, we've got a problem and we
need your cooperation

A group of terrorists have taken
control of the high school

Terrorists?

What are you talking about?

Look, this is an emergency

We have a hostage situation here

My two daughters go there

Jenny, get my wife on the phone

I don't have time for this

Turn on your radio or your TV
if you need conformation

Jane it's Jenny

Mr. Johnson

I've got your wife on the line

Well check if the kids are ok

One second detective

Are the kids there with you?

0k, they're there and
they're fine

But she says something terrible
is happening at the highschool

Sorry detective
now what can I do for you?

I need you to cut all the power
to the school

You don't understand

That means shutting down the
whole south west quadrant

I don't care if it's
the whole state

Just do it

Ok, 0k

Call the plant
get Berny on the line

Tell him to be ready for my order
to shut down the whole

south west grid

I'll leave the line open

Well if we get disconnected
you can reach me direct at


Got it, hold on

Whatever you say

I've got Berny

Be rny

Yeah?

Look, be ready to shut down the
whole thing on my order

What ever you say boss

Detective, detective

Will you give us an update
on the negotiation

Right now you know
as much as we do

We know that chief Slater's son
is somewhere up in that highschool

and we need to know what...

Hey, hey, if they find out his
son's inside that school

they'll use him and kill him
if we don't meet their demands

Would you want that to happen
to your son?

Shit

More people in there
than I thought

Guys

What?

Oh man, that's Mr. Vogel

Or was Mr. Vogel

Oh my god

Shh, Shh

Go, go, go, let's go

What happened?

Get back to work

You find them and you
bring them to me

Got it boss

You obviously don't take my
threats seriously

What the hell is going on in there

Don't play dumb with me

This little stunt of yours just
cost you one hostage

Wait, we didn't do anything

Then you should have prevented it

You and you, up

Now

Pick him up and follow me

We got a clean shot at two of them
first floor window

Take them out

No, no, hold your fire

I've got your son on the phone

What? Where is he?

He's in the principal's office

What? Leonard?

Leonard, are you all right?

Boss

What the hell are
you doing in there?

Well, you told me to spend more
time at school didn't you?

Leonard, get out of there
immediately, you hear me?

<i>All right, I'll try, I'll try</i>

Listen
here's the situation here ok?

All right, there's 5 of them left
they have 13 hostages

and they're all in
the assembly hall

And most of them are kids

A couple of them are teachers

And Eddy, Stacy and myself
we managed to stay hidden so far

Oh, by the way, you know
Mr. Vogel the principal here?

He's kind of dead

Yeah I know that

You know something ain't right
also they have a bomb

And if you have a bomb wouldn't
you put it in the basement

plant it down there
some maximum damage you know?

Yeah why?

Well they got it on the
second story

I mean the second floor

It's pointing out a window
like they're going to shoot

it at something

Leonard listen to me

Leny, Leny come on, they're coming

Got to go Pa

Speak to you later

Leonard, listen to me

Leonard

Worshak

Get me air reserve on the line

Leave him alone

What did you say?

Nothing

That's what I thought

Well?

No luck boss

If I was counting on luck
I would have ordered Lubritarian

Keep looking

Yes sir

Come on boys, come on

Wait a minute

Where are we going?

Shop class

Shop class?

General Wainright

Yeah General, this is Leo Slater
I'm the chief here in Mayfield

I need some information please

Oh yes
what can I do for you chief?

Have you had any security problems
there at the base lately?

Any robberies?

What do you mean?

I mean are you missing any bombs
or missiles?

That's classified
information chief

I can't deny or confirm that
information without approval

from Washington

Well listen General
here's what I can confirm

We have a situation here
and if your bomb is part of it

then you have a situation too

Now you can either talk to me or
you can talk to the media soon

as they're sniffing my hind leg
and I'm running out of answers

Now listen here whoever you are

General you listen to me

Now we have something pointing
at our nuclear power plant

I need to know if that's a problem

Jesus

Off the record

Yeah, whatever

0k, but you didn't get it from me

Shit

Get me Doogan

Yeah

Boomer, progress report

Almost got it

Excellent, please continue

I'm beginning to get excited

Your enthusiasm overwhelms me

There's no need for sarcasm

We stand to make quite a fortune
when all this is through

And with two less people to share
it with

Yes, it is unfortunate

We could make it even less

Let's not get too greedy

At least until our little task
is completed

But you won't be upset if we
inherit a few extra shares?

The fewer loose ends the better

And I know how to handle
the loose ends

Oh yes you do

I've noticed you seem to have
quite a knack for it

Well, I just pay attention to
detail that's all

Don't be modest Tanya

I truly believe you have an
honest to go blood lust

I just do what needs to be done

Yes, but you can't tell me you
don't get some small measure of

pleasure from it

Oliver my darling
one should enjoy one's work

Don't you think?

Oh, absolutely

All right

Go in the supply room and get all
the empty bottles you can

Dude this is no time to be working
in a class project

This isn't a class project
trust me, just go

Come on, let's just go

Want some little girl?

I got two of them boss

Oh shit

Come on, come on

When you want your girlfriend
you know where to find me

Yeah, I'll take care of it

Mayfield Electric
they're ready to cut the power

Yeah, this is Doogan FBI
pull the plug

You got it

Be rny

Yeah

Kill it all, now

You got it

Here it goes

What's that?

You take him up to the
assembly hall

I'll handle it

Ok

When I give the word I want you
to go in and secure the area

Your siege plan won't work Doogan

I'm in command here

Well good, then you become famous
for a nuclear fallout that could

make Chernobyl look like
a weenie roast

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about an armor
piercing arrowhead missile

with a state of the alt
guidance system pointed directly

at a nuclear power plant
and that makes me nervous

Don't be ridiculous

He didn't mention a thing about
that in any of his demands

or his threats

Well maybe this guy is more of a
nut case than you

give him credit for

It's our boy

I'm growing tired of your
silly antics

You don't really think turning off
the power is going to stop us

do you?

Well
it's the atomic energy commission

What?

So they can't disband unless they
shut down nuclear power plants

all over the country

And as you may know we here in
Mayfield get our electricity from

a nuclear power plant

Who is this?

This is Slater

And where is Agent Doogan?

I'm right here

They said they have to cut off all
the other sectors before they

can shut down the plant

And you expect me to believe this?

I'm just telling you what
they told me

Well, I'm telling you that as long
as the power is off

I'm going to be
disciplining students

What does that mean?

Figure it out

That's my direct line
I have to call you back

Johnson, you still there?

Yeah

Yeah, it's all been cut

I know, but now we have to have
you turn it back on

Excuse me for saying this but do
you guys know what the hell

you are doing down there?

We're trying our best to keep
sixteen kids alive

Be rny

Yeah

Look, you're not going to believe
this but

You got to be kidding

Here we go

What the hell are you doing here
there's still one missing

You want me to go get him myself

He's just a kid

I'll go get him

Well I wish someone would

I know how to handle little boys

What is your friend's name?

Won't you tell me?

Why?

Because

Leny, Leny Slater

Shut up

Thank you

Wait, Slater?

Be sure to bring him back alive
I want to see this kid

Arrowhead 3 to arrowhead 1

Come in

Mission accomplished
all systems go

Guidance system is locked
on the main reactor

one hour and counting

Good work

Boomer, what if they were to shut
down the main reactor

No difference
the core would still be hot

Thank you

Would you kindly stay with the
unit until we have captured

the intruder

Affirmative

I hate school

Freeze mother fucker, hands up

Hands up, now

Right, hand it over

Hand it over now

Come get it

Come on boy

Come on

Drop it or
I'll blow his brains out

Boomer, toss me the detonator

Don't do it man

I said now

You are one sick bitch lady

Thank you

Now drop the pea shooter Rambo

Don't even try it

You've been a bad, bad boy Leny

You're not so tough after all
are you?

Come on, move it

You know my dad told me
not to fight girls

Good advice

In your case
I'll make an exception

Luther, send Black up the
west stairway

We've got him cornered

You think you can handle that?

I'll back her up

You better hope we find
your boyfriend

He's not my boyfriend

What a Pity

You'd make such a lovely couple

Dying in each other's arms

The only ones that are going to be
dying in each other's arms are you

and that demented slut

Hey man

No

My god

No respect

Shit

Wow

Reminds me of home

Oh Leny

It's all speculation

I can't advise evacuation of the
whole city without some

positive threat

Well there won't be any point
evacuating once they fire

that thing, will there?

We're not even sure they have
the missile

If we start evacuating the whole
city now, there'll be more deaths

from sheer panic than there would
be if they blew up the school

It's your son

Leny, are you all right?

Yeah paps I'm fine, I'm fine
but listen

They've got this thing

It's set, it's armed
it's ready to go off in less

than an hour

I overheard them saying the
guidance system is locked on

the main reactor

Look I want you to get out of
there immediately Leny

can you hear me?

I'm not sure about that dad

Look, this lady they got with them
she's got some sort of detonator

I think it's for the missile

Self-destruct detonator

It's the only thing that'll
stop it now

We have to get that

All right Leny
you're doing a good job

Good work in there

I want you to get out immediately
do you hear me?

No can do Paps

Look, they've still got
Stacy and Eddy

They've got me pinned down

The good news is there's only
three of them left

Can he get to the detonator?

This is a 17 year old kid who
skips physics class for Christ sake

Our only other choice is a
full frontal assault

Paps, Paps, you still there?

Yeah

Paps, I'm scared, what do I do?

All right Leny, listen to me

Oh great sure, sure

Yeah listen Paps, you want me to
throw in a cure for cancer

while I'm at it?

Your our best chance son

All right Paps, just let me ask
you one more thing all right?

What's that?

Can we move back to the Broncs?

I guarantee it

All right, I'll call you

Shit

I should have hit him up for a car

Hey

You scared the shit out of me

All three of these rooms are
connected, I checked them all

Well
I know he's around here somewhere

I can sense his fear

I'll check this hall

Oh, sure

Just get the detonator from the
terrorist, disarm the missile

No problem

Well I haven't checked the
teacher's lounge yet

so let's go check that out first

The receiver is warm
he can't be far

Check all these doors and closets
I'll get this side

All right

Great

Put it down right there

Not long now

Come here you little prick

Game is over Leny

Are you gonna come out like a
good little boy

or do I have to come in there
and get you

Promise you won't hurt me

I promise

Somehow I find that
hard to believe

Come on lady, you promised

You right Leny
but I had my fingers crossed

Now say goodbye

Well the old saying is true

The pen really is mightier
than the sword

Come on, You can't print that

Give me your number

Let me take that

Oh chief, my wife brought over
the best damn coffee in town

Your right

Remind me to have all out shoot
outs at your place from now on

I don't want to pry but I heard
your son had some problems

at the schools back home

Yeah, well, you know, good kid
bad environment, shit happens

Must have been tough on you when
you lost your wife

Yeah, well that's one of the
reasons we came here

New beginning, fresh start
that kind of thing

Funny thing is that Mayfield's
usually a nice quiet place

I've heard, that was our plan

In fact the craziest thing I
remember happening was when

the environmentalists used to come
protesting the plant

And they were peace loving
hiPPV TYPES

Well that's what I don't get
Warshak, I mean why would anybody

be coming here to Mayfield to
stage a war with the

Federal Government?

Besides the power plant
there's nothing

Unless you count the
reserve incinerator

What?

Federal reserve incinerator
It's here

You know it's where they
inventory and then destroy

all the old currency

I've never heard of that

Come on, that's our claim to fame

We burn more money than
any town in the country

How much at any given time?

I'm sure it's millions

Well that's it

We're not dealing with a bunch
of right wing militant fanatics

here, we've got a common
bunch of thieves

The money if worthless

I mean all the serial numbers
are out of circulation

Who do you know who checks
serial numbers

Jesus Warshak

Hey everybody

Freeze

Shit Eddy, Eddy
you all right man?

Bastard shot me man

Yeah I can see that

Got to get you out of here man

Forget me man

He took everybody up to the roof

He made Stacy and the other guys
put on them suits

This

Yeah

Ok

Hey Lei'!!!

Yeah man

You're ok man

You too man

Eddy hang in there
I'll be back for you

I ain't going nowhere

Yeah I can see that

Stay cool

It makes sense, he wipes out the
town then I guess he and his

men take whatever they want

Well then why all the
free peoples militia bullshit?

He probably needed to buy
some time to figure out

the guidance system

I say we move in

I say do what you have to do

Go for it

Base, got some activity
up on the roof

Looks like five anti-radiation
suits surrounded by what could be

hostages

Can you get a clean shot?

Yeah, I think so

No, wait, wait, hold your fire

I'm in charge here Slater

Yeah but something's not right

There should only be three of
them left

Decoys, he must have put some of
those kids in those suits

This is not your call

Listen there are 16 hostages
in there, one of them is my son

This is not Wako
this is not Ruby Ridge

This is Mayfield and I'm not
gonna allow you to screw it up

You are way out of line

I don't give a shit, shut up

Hawkins, hold your fire

They're pulling back but they
left something behind

something big

Let me guess, an arrowhead
armor piercing missile

I'm no expert
but I'll take your word for it

That conformation enough
for you General?

Mr. Johnson's office

It's Warshak, put him on

It's Warshak

Detective, we've been watching
it on TV

You sure got your hands full
with that bunch

Those poor kids

Actually it's a lot worse
than you think

They've put a nuclear missile
on the roof and aimed it

at the reactor

What?

Those crazy bastards

I want you to shut the reactor
down right away

and get everyone the hell
out of there

It's impossible

Do you know how long it takes
to shut down a reactor?

No, how long?

12 to 24 hours, that's how long

Christ

Just send everyone home

Home, you got to be kidding

If that missile lands here
there won't be anything left

standing or alive for 100 miles

That bad huh?

No, probably worse

I'll leave the line open for you

Sound the alarm

Jenny, go home

Come on let's go

Come on, come on, come on, come on
come on

No, no, come on

Move it, in that room

Right there, come on

Let's go, let's go

Ain't gonna do much good
without this asshole

Well, well, well
you must be Leny Slater

No, to you it's Mr. Slater

Drop your gun

Drop it

I don't think so

Do it

Go ahead, you'll kill us all

You see we took the precaution of
planting explosive charges

throughout the building

It's out little failsafe mechanism
if you will

The charges are all wired to the
same frequency as the self-destruct

mechanism on the missile

In other words, if the missile
gets detonated prematurely

so does the school

No, you're bluffing

I don't bluff

0k, have it your way

Don't do it Leny

Ok

The detonator too

Carefully

Get out of here, everybody get out

School's out

Listen to me, go to the
assembly hall, get Eddy

and get out of the building
you hear me, get out of the building

This is not my day

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Go, g0, 9Â°

<i>Len'!</i>

Hawkins, move in

I'm still giving the orders
around here

Hawkins, move in

Yes ma'am

Guys, show time

Very good

We've got one on the roof

He's going for the missile

Take him out

Yes sir

Hey, good guy, good guy

They've got this whole place
wired to blow

We've got to get out of here

Look

Come on

Get the hell out of here

Johnson, they've launched it

Come on

Outside, go, go, go

Get in there, get in there

Get him, get him

Right, help me shut this thing off

Close the doors

Medics, come on, get in here

Come on, help him out

Leny are you all right?

Stacy, yeah I think so

Let's go find my dad

Come on, let's get out of here
Ok

You're all right

Hi Pap, good to see you

You are ok
Good. This is Stacy

Stacy, hi
Hi

I'm glad you're all right too
Thank you. Nice to meet you

You'd better call your folks

Yeah, you'd better do that

Dad
we're going to the prom together

0k, well it's gonna be outdoors
this year I think

Looks that way

Listen,
I'm gonna need some new clothes,

new shoes and spending cash

Could you rent me a limo
or something

Limo, yes, sure

See you

Love you dad

Love you too

Kids
