[ Gate Squeaks ]

Hey, come on.

[ Gate Squeaks, Clangs ]
[ Chattering ]

Hey! How you doing?

Hey, how you doing?
That-- That's--
That's my dog, man.

I lost him, like, a few--
couple weeks ago.

[ Man ]
I found him two months ago.

He's not your dog.
Look, I'm telling you,
you had him for two months.

You said you found him.

Ye-- I'm the owner
that lost him.

You don't just
put a little dog
out into the street.

I ain't--
I was afraid he was gonna
run into the traffic.

I ain't put him in the street.
I left him on my stoop,

in the confines of my property.

Where did you find him?
Right over there.

Right over where?

At-- At my house.

You found him, right?

Yeah.
Exactly.
I lost him.

I found him, put up signs
up and down the street.

I knocked on doors.

So why-- [ Chuckles ]
Why didn't I hear you
knock on my door?

I've been looking for him
for how long now?

I paid $250 for this dog.

You can't pay $250
for a pit bull.

You can't tell me what I can pay
and what I can't pay.
In Brooklyn there's...

a thousand pit bulls running--
If I wanted to right now,
I'd just take the dog from you.

That's what <i>I</i> used to do.

When I was young--
I was 16 years old,
I see something I want--

You got my dog.
He's mine.
No conversation.

I wouldn't have none
of this dialogue with you.

It's not--
It's not like that, okay?

Look-- Okay, look--
It's not like that <i>now.</i>
<i>I've changed.</i>

You put up signs. You did
whatever you had to do.
You knocked on doors.

Now I'm here.
This is my dog.

You put up signs to find
the rightful owner.
Here I am.

His name is Prince.

His name's William.

Why didn't you put up signs?

Hey, come here.
'Cause it's something
I don't do.

Where I'm from,
we don't put up no signs.

"We don't do that." Who's we?
Look, we are from
two different worlds, dog.

Tell me.
I'm from where people get...

shot on a regular basis,
and it's nothing.

That's what I'm telling you.

I want my dog.

What would I--

The thing is
that I love this dog.

I love him too, man.

There's no way
I could keep this dog?

You either give me the money
I paid for him,

or you giving me my dog back.

So--
It's plain and simple.

So if I--
If I give you $250?

If you give me the $250
right now, he's yours.

So when am I gonna
get my money?

I don't know, I'll give you--
I'll go get money
in the morning.

[ Man #2 ]
All right.

I was expecting to come back
to Prince on the stoop
exactly where I left him,

like many times
I've left him before.

But that's all right?

It's not all right,
but I honestly don't have
a choice right now.

What's your name?
Keith.

Abu.

[ Machine Beeps ]

I understand that you were
in a car accident, right?
I was, yeah.

Uh-- I was really running late,
and it was pouring rain.

Um-- I had pulled over
to a bus stop actually.

And I asked somebody
for directions.

They told me I was in
the complete wrong area.

So I was trying to make a
U-turn, trying to turn around.

So I was crossing over.
I crossed into
the right lane of traffic,

and I was coming up like this,
and I was trying to turn
into a turning lane.

Um-- And when I turned
into the lane, he hit me
on the passenger side, this way.

So it kind of caused the car
to spin, and I ran into
a median wall...

and really kind of crushed
the whole front end
of the car in.

And did you, uh,
wait for the police?

I did, yeah. It actually
happened right in front
of a police station,

so I didn't have
to wait real long.
[ Mutters ] All right.

Did you get a estimate
for the damage to your vehicle?
I did.

They have to replace essentially
the whole front end of the car.
It was something like $15,000.

Okay. I'm gonna ask you
to get that to me.
Signed and stamped, please.

All right?

Okay.

You know, I--
I spent quite a bit
of time in Kenya.

That's great.
How was it?

It was amazing actually.
It was a really
unique experience.

Okay. And where did you
have the accident?

It was in Queens.
It was in Queens. All right.
All right. Queens.

Now...

the insurance company has
a certain dollar amount
for your injuries.

We're making a left-hand turn,
and all of a sudden this
big truck comes...

rearing around the corner
and hits us head-on.

The whole front of it
was smashed in,

and the wheel was, like,
turned up.
[ Chuckles ]

It was a Honda Accord.
It was, like, '89.

I know, you imagine it
still out there?
Oh, wow. Pretty old car.

You have any, uh,
pictures of the damage?

I have pictures,
but I didn't
bring them with me.

Oh. Okay.
I don't know. But I can get them
to you if you need them.

Don't worry about it.
I've seen a lot of accidents,

heard a lot about
different cases,

so... that's it.

Now, the insurance company
has a certain dollar amount
for your injuries--

[ Typing ]

[ Buzzing ]

Baby boy.

What's up, man?
What's popping,
baby?

All right, all right.

Looks good.
Six months?

I had to get out, man.

Man.

Word, dog.

What's up with you?
Chilling, man.

The hood miss you, boy.

Miss me?
You already know.
Come on, man.

I wonder why.
Come on, man.

Every time they see me,
they be like, "Yo, where A at?
Where A at?"

You know what I mean?
So, I don't know,
you know what I mean?

So now I know.

Corporate life,
corporate world--
treating you good?

I do all right.

All right.
I hear that, man.

But, yo, I need you
to do me a solid, man.

I need you to hold
something for me.

All right.
[ Zipper Unzips ]

[ Typing ]

[ Typing Continues ]

[ Birds Twittering ]

[ Doctor's Voice ]
How long has it
been bothering you?

[ Abu's Voice ]
A couple of weeks now.

[ Doctor ]
Stabbing pain or--

[ Abu ]
Severe, yes. Stabbing.

I was driving in the rain.
It was raining really,
really hard.

And this big Bravada
just literally hit me
on the side.

And my car spun
a couple of times.
Air bag comes out.

That's pretty much
the short story of it.

Exactly-- [ Groans ]
what part of your car
got hit?

The, uh, my--
The passenger side
of the car.

The passenger--
Mm-hmm.

[ Groans ]

[ Coughs ]

[ Children Chattering ]

This could be
the flower.

So the test results came back,

and the problem that you have
is coming from one
of the soft tissue organs.

Okay.
The pain you're having...

is all coming
from something
called a sarcoma.

Have you ever heard
of a sarcoma?

No.
A sarcoma is a malignant
type of cancer.

And you have this
in your stomach.

I had hoped that this
was a benign tumor...

that was causing
all the gastrointestinal
problems you were having.

This is a very rare type
of cancer that you have.

They tested
and re-tested everything,

and they came out
with a diagnosis...

of hemangioendothelial sarcoma,

which is a very,
very rare type of cancer.

And how to treat it is, really,
a little uncertain right now.

So at this point,
I'm gonna send you
to an oncologist...

to get evaluated,
and they're gonna treat you.

They'll probably
go with chemo.

You've heard of chemo?
Yeah.

It's gonna--
It's a process.

It takes time,
it's gonna
knock you out.

You're gonna lose weight.
You're not gonna
feel great,

but it might buy you
another six months.

Do you have any family,
friends-- a girl?

No, not really.

Do you have insurance?
No.

<i>[ News, Indistinct ]</i>

[ Sighs ]

[ News Continues, Indistinct ]

[ Retching ]

[ Coughs, Vomits ]

[ Groans ]

[ Gasps Softly ]

[ Typing ]

So on a scale from one to 10,
how bad would you say
the damage is?

Eight.
Did you end up going
to the hospital?

Uh, no. The paramedics
cleared me at the scene.
I was-- I was okay.

Are you in therapy?
What?

Are you in therapy?
Physical therapy?

No.
"No." [ Mutters ]

You go to a physical
therapy office.
Right.

Not a doctor's office.
Right.

I don't know what to tell you,
but this is really,
really irresponsible.

The car hit me. You are
in charge of taking care
of the car's policy holder,

or whatever,
and you don't wanna pay me.

[ Cell Phone Buzzing ]

Hello?

What's going on?

I'm at work right now.

I was at the second job,
you know,
doing the bouncing thing.

Yeah.

Oh, man, well--
It was crazy.

The whole bar was fighting,
throwing chairs,
throwing bottles--

flying through the air,
you know.

It's, like, I busted up my hand
taking out this guy's teeth.

Huh?

Huh. It was a few guys.

They took me out?
No.

I know.

I got some bills to pay
and some people
to pay back, so--

I'm gonna make
a little bit more money.

â™ª [ Speakers:
<i>Man Rapping, Indistinct ]</i>

It seems like one of those
jobs that's pretty easy
to kind of just... pick up.

If you know
the right people though.
Yeah.

Lily, can I get
a soda water?
Yeah, sure.

Do you want anything
in it? Bitters?
Just straight, fine, thanks.

How's it going, man?
Pretty good.

How was your night tonight?
Wasn't that bad.

Oh yeah? You didn't have
to bust any heads?

No, not tonight.
[ Chuckles ]

He busted a million heads.
Hey, man,
so I want to know--

Um, you ever been shot at?
[ Lily Laughs ]

[ Abu Chuckles ]
It seems like the sort of thing
that might happen...

to a bouncer
if you're working at
a certain kind of bar.

Ah. I've been shot at
about four times.

I think I would've remembered
how many times I'd been shot at.

You see, I try to avoid
situations where people
might be shooting at me.

But you, you enjoy--
You walk right into them.
You get paid to do that.

That's your profession, right?
[ Scoffs ]

If I was a cop,
that would be my profession.

[ Man ] Yeah, I guess you're not
a police officer. What you do
is a little different.

You're still here, right?
That's what counts.
You've been shot at,

but you're still here
sitting at the bar.

That's true.

[ Man ] Lily, where did you
go to college?
Did you go to school?

I sort of went to school, yeah.
[ Man Chuckles ]

Did you go to school,
Shannon?
No.

It's all right, man.
You don't need a college degree
to do what you're doing.

You know what I mean?
Hmm.

So where did you grow up, man?
You grow up around here?

I grew up in East Flatbush.
What was it like
growing up out there?

A lot of kids
in the neighborhood,
they just ran wild...

and... just being stupid.

[ Man ] I've heard about it in
rap songs, I've-- I've seen news
stories about it, I suppose.

So it's like that.
It's like 50 Cent says.

That's exactly how things
go down. [ Laughs ]
Not though.

Personally, I don't
really know you that well,

but I don't-- I don't know
what the fuck you're talking
about, to tell you the truth.

[ Laughs ]
My personal opinion.

I mean, what are you
trying to say?

I just said it.
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

I'm sitting here,
I'm trying to have
a fucking conversation...

with the bartender here.

It's been a long fucking night.

[ Mutters ]
It's time to wrap things up,
I think.

You went to college.
You learned all what you had
to learn in school,

and you're still
dumb as fuck.

So shut the fuck up.
I mean, I'm-- You're not
the first person...

I appreciate you insulting it,
but I don't really care what you
think about me, to be honest.

Now, you shut the fuck up,
or I'll make you
shut the fuck up.

Come on, man. I mean,
I don't think physical violence
is really necessary right now.

[ Bottle Shatters ]
How many times I gotta say?

Man, come on.
[ Lily ] Guys, this is
fucking retarded. Stop it.

I mean, just chill
the fuck out.
Guys, stop it, seriously.

It's the end of the night.
I really don't want, like--

You're here to, like,
stop people from fighting.
I'm gonna clean up the bar, man.

[ Lily ] Everyone just-- I'll--
[ Man ] And I'm so gonna
get your ass fucking fired.

[ Lily ] I'll just-- I'll just
close up, like, seriously.
[ Man ] Fuck you.

[ Lily ]
Just don't--

I don't know.

What's going on with you?
Been around working.

Been around working.
Yeah, that's fine.

Doing what?
I got a job. I work
at a insurance office.

Huh.
Yeah.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

Uh-huh.
One hundred percent sure.

Can I trust you?

I got a good job now.
I'm doing good for myself.

[ Woman Arguing, Indistinct ]

Here come loudmouth.
Lord, have mercy.

[ Arguing Continues ]

You don't have
no respect for me.
[ Woman ] I sure don't.

You can just
leave it at that.

See nothing changed.
Yeah, sure ain't.

[ Chuckles ]
Sure ain't.

Yeah. I came back
with the money
I had for you.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

I told you
I'd pay you back.
Mmm.

A lot of times when you
tell me stuff like that,
you don't follow through.

I changed, Ma.
Mmm.

Things are different now.
Oh, yeah?

Yeah.

That's clean money. Told you
I have a job. I work
in midtown Manhattan now.

Yeah, but a lot of people
have jobs and have drugs
on the side and stuff like that.

And they be doing stuff
that they ain't supposed
to be doing.

No, no, no.

That's all in the past.
Mm-hmm.

[ Clears Throat ]
I don't know.

Can I count it?

We'll see.

$200 is what
you owe me, right?
Yes.

So this is 300.
I know.

So what's that for?
That's for you.

What is that?
That's my phone.

Oh, okay.
All right.

I just want to take
a picture of you.

Well, you know
I don't take
a good picture.

So... whatever's there,
you get.

Just throw one at me.
'Cause that's it.

Can I see what it look like?
[ Woman Muttering In Next Room ]

'Cause you know
I can't take
a good picture.

[ Woman ]
That's what I feel--
stupid.

Mmm.
[ Muttering Continues ]

Okay. All right.

But my head look like
it's all bloated.
[ Chuckles ]

Look at my head.
That's where I get it from.
When people tell me...

I got a big head,
I'll know what it look like
on a picture.

[ Laughs ]
I got a big head.

I got a big head.
That's where I get it from.
That's 'cause you're a guy.

You're not selling
drugs anymore?
I don't touch that.

I stay away from it.

You know, it's easier to get--
to get into that stuff,
but it's hard to get out.

There's always somebody willing
to pull you back in there.

Yeah.
There's always somebody
willing to pull you back.

Uh-huh.
You right about that.

[ Woman Mutters ]
But I'm out, Ma.

All right.
I promise you.

[ Woman Arguing, Indistinct ]

Be quiet for a minute.
[ Arguing Continues ]

You know, if they don't leave,
I'm gonna put my foot up
this bitch's ass.

[ Chuckles ]
I swear I'm gonna have
to hurt her.

Her husband came in
last night saying-- Oh, man.

Your aunt is really ridiculous.

Pretty eventful life,
don't you think?
Your aunt is really ridiculous.

She keeps going on and on
and on about nothing.

About nothing.

[ Abu ]
You know, I've been thinking
it's time to go back home--

get out of the city.

In a way I wish I could...
move back home,

'cause I have to live
with all this.

New York City
is definitely not--
Live with all this.

It's definitely not
the right place.

You know, you're doing--
With the stuff you're doing
and whatnot--

and you say you're gonna
straighten up your life
a little bit--

But you're still my kid,
you know.

You're still my son,
regardless of whatever happen,
you know?

I'll--
I will always love you.

You can't just have a child
and-and forget about it.

You love it regardless of what
it do, but you can always
turn your back a little bit.

You know. Distance yourself
from that child...

until they decide
to straighten up.

I guess I just had
to learn by myself.

You have to learn from your
mistake. Not by yourself.

You have to learn
from your mistake, you know?

You make a mistake,
you learn from it.

You learn from it.

So--

I'm just saying I'm sorry.
Okay.

All right?

You know,
I'm still angry at you.

I know.
I didn't say everything
was gonna be perfect.

Well, it ain't gonna
never be perfect.

It will never be perfect again.
But we can work on that.

Yeah.
We can work on that.

[ Elevator Bell Dings ]
Yeah, man. Remember Ace?

Uh-huh.
Yeah. The boy got
locked up again.

What's new?
[ Scoffs ]

Whew! I'm gonna
take my hat off.

Corporate America, huh?
Life is good,
huh, good brother?

Yeah, life is definitely
good, man.
Sheesh.

Why do you think I left?
Where's your desk at?

Right here.
[ Drawer Slides Open ]

That's what I'm talking about.
Probably lookin' too hard.

Think I'm gonna come back--
try and get a job in here.
Nah, you good.

[ Sighs ]
You don't have to.
It's all right.

Told you I'll
take care of you, right?
Yeah?

We good?
Yeah, yeah, we good.
Just about.

Yo. Appreciate it, man.

Take care of yourself
in this new life of yours, man.

You know where I'm at.

I won't be coming back.
You're good.

I'll see ya later.

What you have to deal with?
Never would--
That's personal business.

Some personal shit
I had to deal with.

Same way we tried to make deals

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Where the fuck was you?
And?

You said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Nigga, you know--

[ Man ] That shit
six years ago?
You know. Nigga, you know--

Nigga, you know
they locked me up
the night before.

I told you I was
in there for the weekend.

And you was out
the next fucking day.

You can feed them
the bullshit, but--
Oh, it's bullshit now?

I know what it is.
[ Chuckles ]
It's bullshit now.

Feed it to them.
Bullshit.

[ Man ]
There's gotta be more to it
than just that, man.

It's bullshit, huh?

Those niggas
would've killed me, man.

I needed you.

I needed <i>you.</i>

What you want me to say now?

Apologize, what?
I ain't gonna
say sorry.

You ain't gonna say sorry?
For what?
I had shit to deal with.

You had shit--
What the fuck

What the fuck could you

It's me. Nigga, it's me.
He said he got locked up, man.
What happened to you?

Nigga, it's Jay.

How many times you said to me,
"I have something to do"?

Tell me when I told you--
How many times

I had something to do.
How many times I called
your phone, you ain't answer.

I was knee shit--

Huh?

By myself.
Where the fuck was you at?

And the one time--

Nigga, 50 g's.

Yo, easy-- Right, man.

Hey, Miss D, how you doing?

Hey.
[ Chuckling ]
I was gonna pick that up.

My name ain't D.
My name-- No, no.
I take bottles to the store.

My name is Margaret,

Miss Margaret D.
[ Chattering ]

I'm still full.
It will always be
Miss D to us.

Always be Miss D.
Thank you.

Yo, when you gonna smoke--

Miss Margaret. You good?

[ Chattering ]
Got a bottle.

Yeah, 'cause the recycling come

Y'all pick up your own shit.

[ Man ]
Come on, D.

You got a shot.

I told you I got it.

[ Chattering ]

Why you hounding me

I'm trying to avoid you?

How many times--
Look. I got the money.
I got the money.

I'm gonna get

[ Man ]
Yo, fuck y'all niggas, man.

You know, look--
Don't even worry about that,
man. That's nothing.

Don't even worry about that.
That has nothing
to do with you.

Don't even worry about it.
Look. I said I have the money
to you. I have the money to you.

Okay?

All right?
Is every-- Everything's good?

All right. All right.

I don't know, man.
Brother said, "I'm leaving too."

Yeah, he like, "I don't know.
I see two dudes leaving,

For real.
[ Chattering ]

We got shit to do.
Yo, whose is this, man?

[ Chattering ]
Whose is this?

Oh, a'ight, my man.
Yeah, don't drive, man.

Don't let this motherfucker

[ Man ] I'm saying,

Can a guy hit it? Oh!

What's going on, playa?
Peace. What up?
How you doing, man?

A'ight.

[ Margaret ]
No, no. Don't worry about it.
We good. Let's go, baby.

Yeah, I'm chillin'.

Tell Vanessa to call me.

Stop saying that shit, man.
Yo, I'm gonna tell--

[ Chattering ]
That's what I'm talking about.
Leave her alone, man.

This nigga's still on Vanessa.
[ Chattering ]

[ Chattering ]
[ Hands Clapping ]

[ Man ]
Hey, excuse me, my brother.
Can I say something to y'all?

[ Man #2 ]
Yes, sir.

[ Man #1 ]
All my life I've been
getting into trouble,

you know,
selling my little drugs
here and there.

I did it more times
than making money--

I just maxed out June 11
of this year right here.

The last bid I just did
was a two and a half to flat.

Every time I put my hand
on a bundle...

or anything,
I'm always in jail.

I'm always here
calling my people
to help me out.

I can't do that no more.
I'm getting too old for that.

So I chose to stay home
and get my own money.

You know, I'm getting ready
to get a lot of shit, man.

All you gotta do is just
get out there and do it.
And you gotta do the footwork.

The footwork ain't gonna do you.
You gotta do the footwork.

See what I'm saying?
Y'all can spend money
to get that.

Y'all can spend money
and go and look for a job, man.

See what I'm saying?
And that's easy.

'Cause sooner or later,
this world gonna
come to an end, man.

Sooner or later this world
gonna to come to an end.

You want to leave
something here in this world...

that you could at least say
I left something in this world,
you know.

And that's how it is
with all parents.

And that's what
y'all gotta do.

You want to have
something in this world...

that you can talk about
that you left behind.

That you left somebody here
to carry you on.

If y'all got kids--
See them kids grow up...

to get to where y'all got, man.

You never want to see a kid die
before their parent.
That ain't no good.

You die before your parent,
there's something wrong
with that.

Ain't gonna come in this
world and say, "I'm not gonna
leave nothing in this world.

I leave this daughter
or this son in this world here
to carry me on,"

you know,
and that's how it go.

You know,
you don't come in this world
and ain't got nothin'.

You leave out of this world--
You come in this world
with nothing,

you leave out with nothing,
that ain't no good.

And-And-And
y'all can do it, man.
And y'all can do it.

And y'all can do it.
All you gotta do is just--
[ Man Speaks, Indistinct ]

Fall back, man, and say,
"I could do it one day."

I told you. I did it.

I ain't been back to jail
since I've been home.

And I usually
be-- be in jail right now,

you know,
because I like doing my thing.

I chose not to
do my thing no more.

I do my thing,
I get in trouble.

You know,
I sell my little loosies.

I get my money
from selling loosies all day.

[ Bottle Shatters ]
Got a hundred dollars
in my pocket every night...

I'm not bothering nobody,
I'm not stealing from nobody,
I'm not robbing nobody.

So there's plenty of time--
I came here-- And I've lived
here all my life here.

And I'm 51 years old.

And I let y'all know
what I'm talking about.

[ Chuckling ]

That woman got better taste than
me. You know what I'm saying?
Uh-huh.

It's all good, man.
I got that money I owed you.

Oh, I wasn't sweating
that too much, you know.
That's what's up though.

Yeah, I got you right now.

Oh. What you doing,
my man?

Oh.

Six?
That's what it was.

That's what it <i>was.</i> Yeah.

And? What you trying to say?

[ Exhales ]

I mean, I know you doing your
little office job thing, you're
getting serious about that,

you know what I'm saying,
no disrespect to you
and all that, but...

out here, this is
my office out here, man.

You know what I'm saying?
[ Laughs ]

And-- See, you laughing.
Ain't nothing funny,
you know what I'm saying?

But I didn't give
that money to hold.

I didn't give
that money to hold.
It was a loan, you know.

Certain rules come with that.

Trying to charge me
interest now?

I'm not trying
to charge you interest.
He's charging interest.

Yeah, yeah. I got it.
Standard operating
procedure, man.

I know what it is.
All right.

What you got?
Now we talking.
Now we're talking. Okay.

No. Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

This is how much it would
have been if it was on time.
[ Sighs ]

But seeing as how you're late,
you know what I'm saying,
it's $200.

Late--
Yes, late is $200.

And this is business.
It's not personal.

It's not my money, you know.
You know whose money it is.

You know where
this money's going.

If it was me,
it would be different,
but it's not.

Yeah, I know. Whatever.
[ Chuckles ]

Don't be like that.
Don't take it personal, man.

This is us, B--
This is--
Oh, okay, I like that.

You want a receipt
with that, friend?

[ Birds Chirping ]

[ Chattering ]

Hi. How you doing?
Can I help you?

Do you have any rooms
for tonight?

Uh, yeah, we do.
How much?

Uh, $50.

[ Chattering Continues ]

Uh, Room 7, okay?

Thank you.

Mmm.
Yeah. Me too.

Cheers.
The county of Kings.

â™ª [ Speakers: Rock ]

You know, a friend of mine
used to live around here.
Mmm.

Um, then he started this farm,

Flaming Bunny Acres.

I asked him once,
"Why Flaming Bunny Acres?"

So he tells me this story.
He's out camping.

They got
a campfire going, and...

this bunny rabbit
comes running in...

from-- from out of the woods
and, like, leaps into the fire.

They grab the bunny,
and they put it on--
[ Taps Table ]

They stamp out the flames,
and the bunny
goes running away.

They're like,
"What the fuck was that?"

So they wait a little while,
and they're, like-- You know,
now they're relaxed, and...

the bunny comes back--
[ Chuckles ]

and goes for the fire again.

Again, they, like, take it,
and they walk it
far into the woods.

And they're like,
"Bunny, like, go. Live."

A little more time goes by,

they're laying down,
they're barely-- they're
kind of falling asleep,

and they're woken
by the sound
of the bunny on fire.

Flaming Bunny--
Flaming Bunny Acres.

Acres. Wow.

So I'm out there.
Last night was my,
like, third night out.

I'm thinking
of going back, but, uh--
[ Indistinct ]

I, uh, didn't check the weather.

Stupid.
Rookie mistake.

So, I wasn't
thinking much of it,

but there's these thunderclaps
far off in the distance,
and they get closer.

I'm here in my tent. I can't
see anything except flashes of
lightning and hear this thunder.

And I'm like, "Oh, my God,
you know, the lightning's
gonna hit a tree,

it's gonna fall
on this tent,
it's gonna kill me."

And so I just
laid there, like, wide awake,
couldn't sleep a wink.

You know,
anything can happen to you,
and if you're hiking solo,

you know, who's gonna find you?

What are your plans?

I don't know.

See what they got,
I guess.

If you do hike,
when you get to the trailhead,

there are these little boxes
you gotta register in
at the head of the trail.

You gotta fill that out,
because...

if something
should happen to you--
Mm-hmm.

you know, that's, like,
the last place that you've been.

So they can--
You know, the rangers
will start to look around.

So, really important.
So, um, you fill this out...

so they can find you.
Yeah.

If you get lost,
and you're not back.
Yeah.

So how would I get there?
Well,

the trailheads
are pretty well marked right
there on the side of the road.

It's usually a brown sign
with yellow lettering.

You just follow the trail.

And like I was saying,
it gets dark out there
real quick.

Um, goes dusk to darkness
real fast.

As soon as you notice that
it's starting to get dark, you
don't want to be on the trail,

'cause then you can't
see shit, you know.

You know.

So you thinking
about going hiking?

Yeah, I just might.

I just might.

â™ª [ Speakers: Rock ]

I think this is something
I have to do by myself.

Can't always have
somebody there with you.

Yeah.

Look at your hiking.

You got lost,

tree almost fell on you.

You were by yourself.

That's true.
Right?

Yeah, I guess,
you know, that's--

Maybe that's what
camping's about.

Hmm. Maybe.

Ah, especially out here.

Quiet. Dark.

[ Chuckles ]
Yeah. It is quiet,
and it is dark.

And there are bears around.

What's up, guys?
How you doing?

You have a drink with me
for-- on my birthday here?

It's your birthday?
Yeah.

All right then.
[ Man ]
Happy birthday.

Happy birthday.
Thirty-- Thirty-one
years young.

Thirty-one years young.
Here you are.
[ Woman ] Happy birthday.

All right. Cheers, boys.

Cheers.

What's this? Tequila?
Mm-hmm.

Oh, yeah.

Nice.

[ Sighs ]

Thanks.

[ People Chuckling ]

Hey, big guy.

What's up, man?
No, I'm talking
to this big guy.

Fine.

How-How-How do you sing
happy birthday?

[ Man, With Accent ]

Very well could be.

Oh, wow. That's awesome.
