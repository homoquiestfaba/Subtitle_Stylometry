In a small village in Asia called Serenity Falls ...

once lived a legendary fighter.

Fighter is so fabulous that his legend was legendary.

No opponent was not worthy of this great powerful warrior.

His name was Zibo.

The warrior was so terrible that no one dared to utter his name.

Zibo! Stop can dream and continue to ribas.

What?

I went myself, Zibo. I have the gym to practice.

Perfect as my body is not only sculpts, you know?

I'm sorry you dear cage, but ...

if you saw a great teacher Hana?
Certainly. There it is there.

Perfect ingenuity. Perfect body. NareÄ‘ajte is young!

Do you think I could've talked with Grandmaster Han?

Do not you talk with the teacher Hana.

Master Han story with you.

Do you think that the great teacher of Han to talk with me?

No way. If ...
If you?

If a teacher does not Han spilled tea and invite you to clean my!

Just kidding because it's funny to laugh ...

you.

Come on! Bali did not want to hurt feelings Zibova small.

You missed the place. When I go like this ...

And a mighty warrior, Ziba is tiresome Bali ...

and freed the great indignation of the Sun 1000!

Mighty warrior ...

need help.

CAREER DAY once lived a legendary warrior ...

so fabulous, that his legend was legendary.

No opponent was not worthy of this great powerful warrior.

You did not fight the dinosaurs. It is impossible.

Yes.
It is not.

Yes.
It is not.

Dad, tell him.

He's got a son. I fought the dinosaurs.

I fought two dinosaurs!

It's super!
No way!

Dinosaurs are extinct 200 million years ago.

These dinosaurs have fallen through a black hole ...

and were transferred to the future.

No physical evidence of the existence of black holes.

You're a genius was a department?

And there were black holes exist in the universe.

Actually, Einstein.

Because their space dinosaur with a small boat down the course ...

and was caught in the funnel of the gravitational field of a black hole!

It was a great dad! I can not wait ...

my friends to see action in dodÅ¾ou tonight.

Really?

What? No, Ming!

Does not have to go to the dojo tonight.

I had the opportunity to talk with the teacher about Hana.

You said that you and friends can see the dojo where you train.

I know, but I did not say when.
You!

When I asked, you said "one day".

Today is the day.

Today is today, one day ...

Tomorrow?

No, tomorrow is tomorrow. Today is today.

One day ...
When?

Well, one day is ... One day!

Not today or tomorrow ...

but one day in the distant future.

Inter planetary teleportacionoj zavijugenoj future!

But I have already told friends this morning.

Come on. You know what are friends.

They must have already forgotten.

See you tonight at dodÅ¾ou, Ming.

Please, Dad.

I will never anything else to ask while I'm alive. I promise.

DuplobeÄ‡avam. TriplobeÄ‡avam.

The answer is no.

I wish that my mother was there. It would certainly say that.

Yes, I would like to now mama here.

Do you know how. PopriÄaÄ‡u with Grandmaster Han today.

I'll see what I can.
Promise?

TriplobeÄ‡avam.
Thanks Dad.

Wow!

Maybe I came in evil times?
Nonsense.

Time is neither good nor evil. Although your timing could not be worse.

Excuse me teacher.
Enter.

You drew my attention. Now use it.

That's it. Should be used.

Duck is the best simmering at 200 degrees.

What's the matter so much on your mind?

Well ... Here's how.

I thought if I can bring my son and a couple of his friends in the dojo.

Today.

Never ask questions you already know the answer.

Right.

It is difficult, because it would mean that I know the answer.

What I do not know.
Look in your heart.

I do not. I still do not know.
EntÄƒo lhe fare pergunta mind.

Do you really think that I refused your son and his friends?

Well, no. I did not mean that.

But I thought that time I only caretaker ...

"Only"? You have only one son. But if you need to obezvrednimo ...

those things that's more?

Is it only the flowers? Only the trees?

Only butterflies? Only the bees?

Everything and everyone is ...

place equal importance in the universe.

Man! When you say so ...

Dojo is welcome for those who want to get on.

Thank you, teacher. Mr., your Highness, Mr. ...

Not at all, Zibo. I remember ...

broom in his right hand can be deadly ...

the sword in his left hand.
Yes, to tell what the sword.

You would not believe the truth of it.

The young man knows the rules, the wise man knows the exceptions.

I do not follow from the "do not mention it, Zibo."

See, here is a real weapon. Not here.

I would be worried about blood loss ... here.

The concern is rust on the blade.

How did you become so wise teacher?

The second edition. There you go. Take it.

Really?

But ... All pages are blank.

Exactly. The only true wisdom ...

to know that you know nothing.

I know nothing!

How dare you come empty-handed?

I wanted to stop by to buy you a pot of flowers for the house.

You know, to be lively dinner ...

but I was late, and I had ...

I'm talking about the necklace, you idiot!
Exactly. Necklace.

I found it.

Still ... The search is a difficult master.

Heavier because of the presence of another.

Second?
Night janitor.

Pnda called Zibo.
Zgazio and ...

dulek than 200 pounds who eats bamboo?

I think the more accurate figure is about 300 pounds.

Search again, Bali. Search as long as you can.

And then again he seeks. Necklace "Fourier" ...

must be somewhere in dodÅ¾ou my brother.

Find it!
To master.

With the collar in the possession ...

Serenity will be able to rule the Folsom with a firm hand ...

and crush all who oppose my will.

Can you suggest something before I go?

If you turn that you propose to paint the walls in green ...

then do not! Do not be.
No, I did not want to.

Although if we painted the walls in green ...

We really have entered the outside to the inside.

What is your suggestion?

The first thing to do when you come to power ...

to change the name of the village. I mean, Serenity Falls? Really?

"Serenity" is a state of peace, tranquility and peace of mind.

I like the irony.
Ironically, a lot of fun.

Especially the oppressed. Invent a name ...

We will put something in the sign ...

strong-arm rule that breaks opponents in hopelessness.

Like what?
I do not know.

Something appealing. Something powerful ...

Can Balivud?
Get out.

Come back tomorrow with a necklace or feel my wrath!

To master. Balivud, it sounds just fine ...

Mightier than the sword.

Add to my inferior opponents, we are not equal ...

Intestinal attack! Or disappear from my hands!

I will never surrender!
Never say never.

You missed me. You want some of this?

Is this pain? Failure.

What to do?
Trained.

For what? Struggle with public works.

Please stop!

My sword is nothing compared to your superior martial arts skills!

I give up!

So the rule of an evil nobleman 100'godiÅ¡nja ...

met its inglorious end!
It was amazing!

What? This? Just a little revive memories of combat, that's all.

I've never heard of a warrior train with a broom.

Once a wise man said, "The Broom of the left hand ...

can be deadly with a sword in the wrong. "

It made sense when he said.

Where to put the sleeping bags?

Why have you brought a sleeping bag?

Do not we would be comfortable to sleep on the wooden floor.

No, no, no. No one will be nowhere to sleep.

Have you heard people? We will stay awake all night.

Hi, I am Shiva. Thank you for allowing us to come to the teacher Zibo.

Teacher Zibo ... Well, in the dojo are welcome all who wish to enter.

Why is it called a dojo?
What do you think, why so called?

Dojo means "path way".

Way of practicing Tae Kwon Doe.

That's it. "Put ways." Exactly.

What's your name?
His name is Koji.

Koji does not like to talk a lot.
Strong and silent character.

Only a faint image.

Remember, KodÅ¾o, here is a real weapon.

Not here.

What is the difference between Tae Kwon Doe and Karate?

Three words.
Funny Daddy.

What is the difference?
The difference? Yeah, well ...

Karate is more ...

The fazon. A Tae Kwon Do is ...

Can you show us how to train in the style of a great warrior?

Great warrior must train for years.

It takes years of intensive work.
Come on, show us the father.

Break boards with bare red paw.

Can it?
Of course you can, right dad?

Just warming up.

Becomes hotter.

You did it!

Tae Kwon Do is more than raw power.

It is important to train the mind.

To my mind like an athlete, he ran the marathon.

Had he not stumbled on your ego.

Make a fist with your paw.

The other hand holding open.

Fist on the palm three times ...

when you say "hammer, scissors, paper."

Then wisely choose one of them.

Wait, is this not "Zikata, zakata, Zoom"?

No, there are many names, "winter, winter zoom" ...

"Beneficiary, Snake, Snuka," "Eci, oven, stove" ...

"Going around you pussy."

As is linked to the Tae Kwon Do?

It is a ridiculous game.

Rules can be simple ...

but the game is as complex as the mind of your opponent.

Is not that the luck?

It is a game of strategy and intuition.

You see through the enemy intends ...

or face certain defeat.

I never watched that way.

I did not either. I mean, I am not even in your years.

How do we know what to choose?

You know the heart of your opponent.

"Stone", is a barbaric move ...

and use it to your most aggressive opponents.

"Scissors", can be aggressive but controlled more choice ...

used by smart and capable opponents.

A "paper"?

Yes. "Paper" is a wise choice.

Do you think this is a weakness.

No, there is a silent power in words such as "paper".

It has the ability to declare war on other nations ...

spreading gossip or statement generous love.

Okay, enough talk. To go into practice?

Who is a volunteer?
I.

Remember. You are a student and I am a teacher.

Observe carefully presents the movement of my opponent.

Zikata, Zakat, zoom.
Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

Scissors are stronger than paper.

Zikata, Zakat, zoom.
Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

The paper is stronger than stone.

Zikata, Zakat, zoom.
Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

The stone is stronger than scissors. This is fun!

Zikata, Zakat, zoom.
Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

Zikata, zakata ... Tandara Mandara ...

The paper is stronger than stone. Smorilo me play. I give up.

The winner is the loser to give up. So why the wins.

Quickly take a stone from my feet.

When you manage to take a stone from my feet, then your training is complete.

Where was gone?

That does not count, I said "go."

Go.

Go.

Go.

For you we need another test.

I'll show you some basic techniques Kenda ...

with ordinary brooms for scrubbing.

Why not use sticks made of bamboo?

Bamboo makes 98% of baby panda.

Typically eat up to half staff training.

Zebo Master, who is it?

This is a great teacher, Han.

He is one of the greatest warriors who walked the earth.

Large tiger warrior who made peace in Serenity Falls.

How is it managed?

Was expelled from his evil brother Slade, forever out of the valley.

Where did he go?

No one knows exactly where it is Slade.

Some think they are hiding in the mountains ...

waiting for the right moment to come back ..

and revenge is a great teacher, Han ...

and the government of Serenity Folsom forever!

Fear not, KodÅ¾aÄe.

While the necklace "Fourier" Slejdovog out of reach ...

he has no power to do any harm.

Necklace "Fourier"?
Is it a necklace?

Yes. Anyone who carries, possesses great power.

What power?
Great power.

What?
Unusual.

Specify?
The magnificent ...

impressive, and overall brand deafening from all absolute power!

What gives power to the necklace?

Crystal necklace contains lava from the depths of a volcano named Baekdu.

This is great!
Yes.

Baekdu Mountain is considered "divine mountain" ...

because some believe that it is the birthplace of our ancestors.

Necklace is taught by a great teacher to another ...

for thousands of years.

Where a teacher Han holds a necklace?

Only he knows where he is.

But the story that is hidden somewhere in dodÅ¾ou.

In this dodÅ¾ou?
Super! Find it!

You will not get you anything you need.

Necklace "Furies" is not a toy.

Otherwise called "Necklace of fun."

Now back to Kendo exercises.

"Super!" We return to metlanju.
Just kidding you ...

but when ovladaÅ¡ these moves, it has to "clean my opponents."

Get it? "Clean my" opponents.

Is this on? Joking aside ...

I'll show you a classic kendo move called "Kiri-Kaes".

Smite the left and right side of his opponent ...

at high speed.

This requires a range of abilities ...

Accuracy, rhythm, and smoothness.

This combined with the acceleration and endurance.

Watch and learn.

What is he doing?
I think Å¡logirao.

I think that meditating.
Yes. I meditate.

Sun you!

Have you made a necklace?

Not really, but I did not come empty-handed.

Did not I tell you that if you come back empty handed ...

have to feel my wrath?

"Did not I tell you that if you come back empty handed ...

have to feel ... "
What are you doing?

Sorry, but your set of sentences is a bit confusing.

When you say, "Did not I tell ..."

if you ask me if you told me, or did you say?

I am really sorry for the confusion. It was a rhetorical question.

Let me rephrase the question as a statement.

Get ready to see his creator!

She came to me mama?

Do you have any last words before suffering himself cut short by getting

you to cut short?

I pray you. I have a very good explanation.

Then I suggest you quickly explain while still breathing.

Remember that the housekeeper that I mentioned?

Fat panda?
Just that.

Tonight, there were others in dodÅ¾ou.

Others?
A group of small animals.

Maybe it's the dinner.
One of the children was his son.

And what to do with finding a necklace?

You do not think you could look for that ...

because natovljena panda ...

and the seven dwarfs left off on your way?

Dude, you're really good. Really know how to Rabisha people.

I feel uncharacteristically merciful.

That's why I'm offering you a choice. You can go back to the dojo ...

and bring back my necklace until dawn ...

or you can stay here and die, and I assure you ...

it will be very slow and painful death thoroughly.

I wonder what your dad thinks while meditating.

I do not know.
You might think of your mom?

Maybe.
Do you miss him?

I guess.
Certainly so.

Are you missing?
Yes.

When mom got sick, she said she will watch me ...

Although I can no longer see her.

Do you think that you now observe?

I do not know.
Certainly so.

I'm glad I came tonight.
Me too.

KodÅ¾o, is that you?

The horror!

Good bird, KodÅ¾o!

Why did I even left a nice England?

Pubs, palaces, the white cliffs of Dover ...

pubs.

Bali Teacher! Glad to see you.

Can you help me?
Again, your back?

I am afraid it is.
Well, here we go.

Ready? 1, 2, 3, pull pull!

Much better.
Cracks!

Fast. Ziba teacher needs help.

No! It's okay. It's not a burglar.

This teacher is Bali. Are you okay?

JaÅ¡ta! I felt much better not to sit the whole weight on my spine!

Of course. Sorry about that teacher.

Actual him!
What are you doing here so late?

Master Han sent me to take the necklace "Furies."

The real necklace?
Yes.

He gave me precise instructions to find her ...

and to bring him up to dawn.

Hold on. Master Han told you where the necklace is hidden?

Of course.

I could not get it back

I do not know exactly where the hidden ...

Can I see it?
I want to see.

So do I.

No, no, no and jok.

Please, Daddy?
I guess there is nothing wrong.

Do you?
Well, I ...

Then solved.
Thank a teacher Bali.

Nothing. You know how ...

Let's have a contest. Something like a treasure hunt.

Everyone needs to find a secret site ...

and the first to find a necklace that can hold

while others can only watch.
Super. I can not wait.

I do not know.
We invite kakanjca fun.

We invite kakanjca fun.

Please contact the bore area to take your prize.

I am not kakanjac fun ...

Kakanjac fun, fun kakanjac.

Ready, set, go!

Get out of my way!

Simply pie!

His sun! Sun!

Giving up Teacher Bali.

You can not give up! Not now!

Now tell us where the necklace is hidden.
How could I know parsley him!

You said that was a great teacher Han told you exactly where it is located.

I know what I said.

So you should be looking for that I completely forgot.

I really do not remember? You need to play "sudoku" ...

Since it strengthens memory.
I do not need a mind game!

I need a necklace!

Necklace "Fourier"!
I found it!

You found it!

We need to put her down quickly.
Is too high.

How to reach?
With the pillars.

We do not have stairs.
We are the stairs.

That's right! That's right!

Faster Kobi. My legs are ugrÄiÅ¡e.

Bravo! Now I add.

Can we see it?

Rumble. Smurfs are not you this.
But you said ...

Never mind what I said. There are skinned to me ...

as an ox in cabbage ...

and it is decorated with me if I take this not Slade.

Slade? You just said Slade.

I.
You did.

I did not.

Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

I did not.
Yes, I'm afraid you did.

I did not.
Yes! I'm afraid you are.

Slide, how nice surprise!

I began to think how to come back.

So I wanted to take matters into their own hands.

No need to master. It took a little longer

but I found the necklace.

Give me a necklace pando. Then I'll spare you and your circus animals.

Dad, you will probably give him that right?

How nice! It says. Now give me a necklace ...

in order to establish his rule of tyranny over the Serenity Folsom.

Tata, zaustaviÄ‡eÅ¡ it, right?

You think you can stop the janitor great warriors like Slade?

Janitor? My dad is the greatest warrior of all time!

No opponent who was taller than him.

You even own son persuaded in their funny stories?

Not the story, it's true!

It is true that your dad just cleaned up the mess that other animals leave.

You are lying! My dad is so fabulous ...

that his legend and legendary. Tell him daddy.

Sorry Ming. He's right.

I was not a great warrior. I'm just a janitor.

"Only"? Do you remember anything I taught you?

Brother.
I warned you not coming back here.

"I warned you not coming back here," You were always righteous.

You must have a major baja at parties.

Counter to 3 Vanish, or I will have no choice but to chase away the force.

You and what army?
Army of ...

1. 

2, 3
I'm still here, dude.

Not for long, Sherman.
Sherman?

I told you not to call me that!

But it is your birth name. Sherman Nevil.

Your powers are weak.
You can not beat Slade.

"If I were poured out, I will become stronger than you could imagine."

For the love of God, forsake me Jodinih these citations.

I spoke to you while we were kids and izluÄ‘ivalo me.

Actually, it's Obi Wan, Yoda is.

I do not care and that Jar Jar pickles.
Binks.

What a fool boring!

Neither I can not boast that my favorite character.

Not him! You!

Give me a necklace janitor!
No

Die then!
That's it?

There is no other solution except death?

Go get him Dad!

I can not watch!

Someone tell me what happens.

Bali Teacher Zeba helmet.

Not!

Right. Now it helmet.

Dad, look out!

Lord! I have a necklace!

My! My very own! I have long waited for this day.

With the possession of the necklace, I will soon become king ...

Serenity Falls, and all will bow to me.

Quickly, we have something to do!
I have an idea!

What?
Let us break out!

No, we must take the medallion!
How?

Koji, what do you have stones that you took from the clutches of my dad?

Perfect. Draw the attention of them throwing stones ...

and you grab the medallion. Can?

I hear what you say!

Your voice is subtracted from these wood floors.

Maybe next time you're whispering. But it does not matter.

No interference was not enough that the bananoÅ¾der ...

deducted from my necklace.

You're really fast!

I'm fast. Now give me a necklace.

No
Then I'll take it from you!

Fast Daddy! Make it!

You did it, Daddy!

You saved the Serenity Falls horrible fate.

I'm not myself, but necklace "Furies."

The power of the necklace is in the mind of one who is the owner.

When someone asks where the necklace gets power ...

I reply, "inside".
You say that I did all this?

As a "book of wisdom" that I gave you ...

Necklace is powerful only as long as the person possesses.

For someone, it has all the answers, for others, only questions.

So you did a great warrior!
Your son is telling the truth ...

Master Zibo.
Teacher Zibo?

You scored in one afternoon ...

more than a lifetime to achieve.

With a little training, who knows?

It may become a great teacher, like me.

Try to not disappoint you.
Do or do not. No attempts.

In a small village in Asia called Serenity Falls ...

lived a legendary fighter.

Fighter is so fabulous that his legend was legendary.

No opponent is not up to the big mighty warrior.

Zikata, Zakat, zoom.
Zikata, Zakat, zoom.

His name was a great teacher Zibo.

The warrior was so admired, that everyone knew his name.
