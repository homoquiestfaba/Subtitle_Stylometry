My grandmother used to say...

if you want to make God laugh,
tell Him your plans.

Girls.

Girls.

Told you it was him.

What is this?

Nice ball.

Wow.

You guys play a lot, huh?

Where do you play?

In the street.

In the street?

What about the cars?

We have to move every time.

It stinks.

You over here.

You over here.

And you here.

What's your name?

Dave.

Huh?

David.

Are you ready, David?

He-..

What?

Where's the ball?

I guess I was sleeping, huh?

Francisco.

Hm.

My name looks pretty
lonely on this ball.

How about I get
a few more names on here for you?

Like...

Tomas Cordoba?

Uh-huh.

All right, guys.

I'll bring this one back to you.

I promise.

Okay.

See ya.

All right.

What are we gonna play
with until you get back?

Uh, Jasmine?

Could you get one of
those practice balls Fran-...

Call me if you need a manager, eh?

Thanks.

All right.

I'm ready.

Ola!

I'm a soccer player, man.

I hate interviews.

I told you,
I'm not a speaker.

I happy to have the opportunity and,
and to be here with all of you--

I am thrilled to be here
in the outstanding presence

of you beautiful people.

I am...uh, ecstatic to
be here in front

of all you beautiful people today.

I want to thank my wonderful
manager Francisco.

Morning.

Pepito.

Make sure you get
five cuts out of that.

Marco, remember,
not too many jalapenos.

Too spicy, they won't eat it.

They don't have
the stomach we have.

Morning, Manny.

Morning.

Henri...

have more than
enough fresh mint at the bar.

You bet.

And don't worry,
I have the mojitos down.

You better.

That's our signature drink.

And if they ask, say you're
Irish-Cuban, uh, Mexican-Cuban.

The whole place is
something Cuban for the week.

Yes, sir.

Try his new drink,
see how good it is.

Excuse me.

That's a good sauce.

Buenas, Amelia.

Buenos dias, senor.

Anybody seen Nina?

I can't believe this.

I think I left my wallet at home.

Can I come back and pay you later?

I live close by.

Jose, what's up with Nina?

She was late yesterday,

and today's she's,
uh, twenty minutes late.

That's two days in a row.

Plus calling in sick last week
at the last minute makes three.

And you know
what happens at three Jose.

She'll be here.

Can't run my business like this.

I just can't.

Jose try this.

Chili.

Oh, hey, Pepi let me try that.

Hm.

Just a little bit.

What's for family dinner?

It's almost ready, yes?

Yep.

Chili Rellenos and
roasted quail en mole.

That's a pretty fancy
family dinner.

The chilies are going bad, man.

I'm talking about the quails.

They could have been a special.

Oh, I see how it works, eh?

You just make the fancy staff
orders and I pay for them, right?

Wrong.

We cook for the customers,
not the staff.

Next time you feed them

So what you got there in your hand?

Butterfly.

And what color is it?

Pink
No

Green.

Okay, now what
do butterflies do?

Yeah!

That's great.

Let's see if you could do it again.

To the cloud?

I'm ready, to the cloud.

Let's go.

Wow.

Okay, Luce,
are you ready to play again?

Yes.

Okay.

I'm gonna count.

Family dinner, everyone

You're ready, right?

Let's go!

Marco, andele, andele.

Pepi.

Today's special is pescado Siete Mares.

Shrimp and crab legs over
Mexican sweet black rice,

squash with a papaya lemon oil.

There are three boxes of shrimp
in the walk-in, people.

So push it, push it, push it.

By the end of the day this item
should be eighty-sixed in my kitchen.

The last special is scallops.

I think you've all
served this before

so I'm not gonna
say anything else about it.

I got a special treat, Pepito.

This coming Friday
the National Mexican soccer team,

along with the coach,
will be here for the Gold Cup.

They play the U.S.
out in Jersey next week.

I'm putting them
in on Kevin's section.

There will be no autographs.

I will ask them personally
and then, uh you can ask me.

Francisco made the reservations.

He asked for you.

Manny, I'm sorry.

I don't want to hear it.

Look, I have things--

Things?

Three kids and comes down here
from the Bronx everyday.

You wanna know how many days she's
been late in the last four years?

Zero Nina.

Zero.

I know.

I know how hard that must be.
You know.

You know.

You know.

Okay, so you know.

So you know how easy
it will be for you with no kids,

and know to find another...

Manny, please!

Give me another chance.

I promise I'll make everything good.

How could you be so--

...so what?

Unfair?

It would be unfair,
if in fact, you weren't late.

It would be unfair to
your co-workers for me

to let them continue
doing your job.

This is the second day in a row, Nina.

Not counting the times
people look the other way or,

or cover for you.

What are you talking about?

You called in sick twice last week.

Then you show up to work hung-over.

I was not hung-over.

It's too much already.

Manny, I was not hung-over,
I was sick.

You directing traffic for
the construction site?

Stay out of this.

Oh.

Thank you! Thanks! That's nice.

Nina!

Nina. Nina.

He's unconscious
but I think he'll survive.

Thank you.

Guess I'll see you around.

Hey.

Why were you late?

You know my brother.

Oh, trust me.

I know your brother.

He's a jerk.

Excuse me, you going in?

No.

Thank you.

He didn't have to humiliate me
like that in front of everyone.

I've been working for him
for four years.

And you tell him
that I wasn't hung-over.

I was really sick.

I'm pregnant.

This is one of the first mornings
I haven't thrown up.

Okay, I've had enough for today.

Thank you.

You'd better get back to your boss man.

Wait. Wait. Nina.

So what now?

Guess I'm gonna have to
figure that out, right?

You wanna talk about it?

Manny...

Jose left.

What do you mean, left?

Who's gonna run the line?

Jose is gonna run the line.

Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

Sorry for the interruption.

We are The Dramatics and
we'd like to entertain you.

After our presentation donations
will be gladly accepted.

You can do this.

It's all about the presentation.

We don't need him.

We don't need him.

I have to call my brother.

You don't have your phone?

Here.

Pepito, chop these.

How may I help you?

Manny?

Where are you?

I'm with Nina.

Who the heck is Nina?

I'm your brother.

I know man.

I know.

Uh, sir, you owe me a five.

I gave you a ten.

That's three-fifty.

I, I need to help Nina right now.

You need to do what?

You need to be here.

You work at a restaurant
not a counseling clinic.

You gave me five.

I gave you three-fifty.

Water one-fifty.

Now you better
get back here before I--

I can't.

I can't.

What do you mean, you can't.

Just look in your till, man.

You'll see...

that I gave you a ten.

Listen to me idiota.

If you're not here
in the next ten minutes

you better be
at the unemployment office.

Manny?

Hello?

P-Police?

Ha! Go ahead, Korea.

Call 'em. Call 'em for stealing my money.

Not from Korea.

I'm from China.

You go now.

Alejandro!

Ale jandro! Llama la policia.

Police coming now.

You okay there?

One-fifty.

Have a nice day, sir.

Oh, man, that was crazy.

What happened?

Nothing.

It sounded like that Chinese guy
was speaking Spanish.

Uh, just a typical New York moment.

I'd hate to have to leave.

Why would you leave?

Takes money to live here.

Right about now, they're seating
the Winters' party in my section.

They're usually good for
a two hundred dollar tab.

You'll be fine.

Don't worry.

I mean, there's plenty of
restaurants in this city.

It's not that.

It's looking for a job.

It sucks.

The applications.

The questioning.

I'm gonna need references.

What do you think Manny's
gonna say about me?

Use me as a reference.

Who knows?

You're probably gonna be pounding
the pavement right along with me.

Hey.

Today's my first time.

It takes three times.

Yeah, but you're the chef.

You walked out.

Are you hungry?

Yeah.

I could eat.

I know a good place.

I don't know what
I'm gonna do with this dress.

I'll probably put it on E-Bay.

Can I interest you in one of
my creations, young lady.

How about this nice frog?

I'm sorry,
I don't have any cash on me.

Okay.

Today's a beautiful day,
right?

I guess.

Describe it to me.

What?

Describe it to me and
this piece of art is yours.

Uh...there's some yellow flowers
blooming on a tree--

Forsythia.

And some purple ones, too.

Hyacinth.

You really like flowers, huh?

Oh, yeah.

What's going on across the street?

Uh...it's just an ordinary day in...

New York City, you know.

People rushing back and forth,
cars driving,

everybody's got somewhere to go,
somewhere to be.

Nobody really cares about nothing.

It's like a huge living clock.

It never stops.

Boy, I wish I could see that.

Thank you.

And you...

you keep it real.

I got my eye on you.

Thank you.

All right.

Thank you.

Look at this stuff.

I love stuff like this.

Do you have a mirror?

Thank you.

How do you do?

Looks pretty good, huh?

Sure.

Jose?

Oh, my gosh, it is you.

Helen.

Ah.

Look at you.

How have you been?

I haven't seen you in so long.

Fine.

Um, oh...

I'm sorry.

I...I heard about
what happened to you.

...this is Nina.

Nina, this is Helen.

Nice dress.

You must love Mexico, right?

It's my work uniform.

Um, where do you work?

Uh, we...work for my brother.

Manny?

Mm-hm.

I cook at his restaurant.

What happened to Club Madrid?

Uh, you know, uh...plans change.

So...you never played again?

Who is she?

Someone I use to see.

Someone you used to see, hm?

Do you think I'm as pretty as her?

Of course not.

She's prettier.

So, someone you use to see.

Boy, you are full of surprises.

Kay.

Can't even keep a phone well-fed.

You know, I had to get
a co-signer for this thing.

That's how screwed up my credit is.

Rent's due.

After rent, I'm down to my last five hundred.

I could be picking up
that big tip right now.

Where is this place?

Let's just eat around here.

Patience.

Hi.

Hi.

We only take applications on Tuesdays
from three p.m. to five p.m.

Uh, could you please tell Frannie
that Jose Suviran is here?

Regarding?

Just tell her that I need to
borrow a pound of saffron.

Jose.

What're you looking at?

I can't believe it!

Jose.

What a surprise, huh?

How're you doing, Frannie?

Oh, I'm good.

It's always good to see the man
with the mysterious beard.

Don't tell me you really came
thirty blocks for saffron?

Uh, we came here to eat.

This is my friend Nina.

Oh, just taking the day off,
then.

Nice dress.

Let me guess, it was Manny's idea.

It must have cost him a fortune.

NlNAHe made us pay for them.

Well, I would, too.

You like paella?

Yeah.

All right, we'll have your
mejillones and paella for two.

Okay.

Paella is full of the things
that you need for a child.

Who said I was having a child?

You did.

No.

I said I was pregnant.

I'm not ready to have a kid.

You have a kid, your freedom's gone.

Things change.

Having a kid isn't just a change.

I don't think I even like children.

I just can't do it.

I'm broke.

And alone.

Alone?

I made my decision, okay?

What does the father think?

He's not a father,
and he's not going to be a father.

Just like I'm not going to be a mother.

Not now.

Nina Sharon?

He's all for getting it
taken care of.

Those are the words he used.

As if it were a wisdom tooth
to be pulled out.

You know, I wonder why kids
are always the problem of the mother.

Guys aren't inconvenienced by them.

It doesn't ruin their freedom.

And yet they have all this advice.

What's best for me.

Well...getting it taken care of
is what's best for me.

Put yourself in my shoes.

Do you love him?

I don't.

And what happens
when I find someone I do?

With a kid?

Forget it.

I invite someone up for a nightcap
and pay off the babysitter?

Mr. Right's gonna say, ''Oh, yeah.

I love taking care of
other people's children.

It's hard enough

it's hard enough to get people's

sincerity without
throwing kids in the mix.

I can't even take care of myself.

How am I gonna take care of a kid?

This is yours, this is yours.

Take that out.

Take it, you're done, you're done.

Here, you're done.

Here, that's yours.

What's wrong with that plate?

They sent it back.

What do you mean they sent it back?

It's cold.

It's cold?

Phone, somebody better get the phone.

I better not hear more
than two rings, people.

Somebody better get the phone.

It's on the house, okay.

That's table two, table two.

Uh, I'm-I'm waiting
for the special.

Where's the snapper?

Here, take this out,
take this out to table ten.

Table...ten.

Now--

That looks like--

What is that, man?

What is that?

Take that back.

That's not your...plate!

Come on, it's for the Winters.

Uh, take it, take it.

Do another one.

Tell Mr. Winters
I love his shoes, okay?

Don't give me that look, okay?

I like what you're
doing to this place, huh?

Oh, you like it?

Kitchen's yours.

When do you start?

How about a package deal?

You looking?

I know this
guy'll never come down,

but if you're looking
we could use someone.

If he recommends you.

I recommend her.

Ring me on Monday.

Hm?

Okay...I'm gonna let you guys eat.

Thank you.

I will, I'll call you.

Okay.

It was nice to meet you.

It was nice to meet you too,
darling.

Frannie.

Gracias.

De Nada.

See?

That was easy.

Lemon?

What are you doing
the rest of the day?

Dealing with this.

Do you want to go to
the beach with me?

I want to show you something.

Okay.

But I want to get out of
these crazy clothes.

We can go like this.

Why not?

Uh, but first, uh, I,

I have to go back to the
restaurant to get my wallet.

Pacing...yourself there, Kevin?

Well, these were
the only dishes at my station.

Pepito!

Did you have a good day off?

Hey, Manny!

Your brother's back.

Hey, El Caya!

Where you been, man?

Was it busy, man?

Oh, man, it's been crazy.

We did the best we could.

Two tables walked out on us.

You just sneaking in and out?

You weren't gonna say hello?

Uh, I just came to
pick up my phone, Manny.

Yes.

You forgot your phone.

I called you.

Mama called you, too.

I found the time to call you
even though we...

...were short one chef
during the lunch rush hours.

Where were you, Jose, huh?

You went outside?

Carlos took the trash outside.

He didn't see you outside.

How far outside did you go,
Hermano?

Acapulco?

Where were you?

We wereÒ»we were worried.

We were busy and
you bailed out on us.

You abandoned your own flesh and blood.

Here.

Here.

You can make this up to me by,
by, by cleaning up this mess.

You're lucky I don't,

I don't cut the whole staff and
let you do it by yourself.

Manny. Manny.

I, I have to do this now...man.

What?

I have to go.

What?

What's everybody staring at?

We have work...

You!

In my office, right now!

I called everyone.

I called Mama, Papa.

You left all of us
when you walked out of

that door with
your new friend.

Two tabl-- Hm.

Two tables walked out
on us today, Jose.

Two.

That's never happened before.

Never.

This is, this is bad business, Jose.

Bad business.

Everything to you is business.

I'm sure everyone picked up
the slack and got you...

...and your restaurant
through the day.

But what are you doing for them?

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Am I hearing this correctly?

A-Ask Amelia.

She's been here the whole time.

She has four kids

and commutes from
the Bronx every day.

She has three kids, Manny.

She has kids.

See?

You don't even know her.

And you're giving the Amelia speech to me?

you're just leaving for
some late, drunk waitress?

When did this happen?

You fired a pregnant woman, Manny.

I don't know why she was late,
all I know is she was late,

all the time.

Did you ever stop to ask?

I mean, do you know anything about
any of these people, besides Amelia?

Do you know that Henri the bartender

is making twice as much as
Pepito, my cook?

Why does Kevin always get better
stations than Margarita?

Enter.

What is wrong with you?!

How can you talk to me like that
in front of my employees?!

What is wrong with me?!

What is it with you?

Carlos, Carlos, one of your people
he's below minimum wage, man!

Why is that, huh?

Oh, he doesn't have papers,
so you can get away with it?

It's all about you, man!

Jose?

This is the same pot you bought
four years ago when you opened.

It scorches because it's old.

Buy another one.

You can clean out
your locker, too.

I'm done.

And call Mama.

She's worried.

What're you trying to do?

Are you all right?

What happened?

Let's go.

Don't tell me he fired you?

I can't believe him!

He's such a piece of

He's been good to me.

All right.

Well, I guess we did ruin his day.

I got some things for the trip..

Let's go.

I could really use a bath,
and some Marvin Gaye.

You can take a bath at my parents'.

They may have Tito Puente,
I don't know about Marvin Gaye.

I thought we were
going to the beach.

They live on the beach.

Don't worry.

Oh, I don't worry.

I used to worry,
but then I did a little research

and I found out that
ten out of ten people...

Do you think that
this is all there is?

That we only live once?

Well, so far I haven't met anyone
who's lived twice.

Can I ask you a question?
No.

All right.

I'm just kidding.

What?

Nothing.

Just ask.

Have you thought about adoption?

Do we have to talk about
this right now?

No.

I can't carry a
living thing inside my body

for nine months,
and then, what?

Leave it on a doorstep in
a basket for some stranger?

To me, that's worse than anything.

It doesn't have to be a stranger.

So then I just start
calling up relatives?

My relative?

Hey, Mom, I haven't
talked to you in four years

but I got something for you.

Or how about this?

You can have it.

I bet Manny could
teach it a thing or two.

The Suviran boys can
raise little Nina...

...because right now,

you're probably the only person
in the world I trust.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Nina, Nina.

Wait, wait.

Hold the train.

It's beautiful.

What did he say?

He said you look like a Mexican.

Oh, thank you.

He's inviting us for dinner.

Yo entiendo.

Should we stay?

We're going to help him
plant these trees, all right?

What did he say?

He asked if you liked flowers.

Oh!

Yes.

I do.

I love flowers.

Okay, what just happened?

What?

Nothing.

Wow!

Oh, man.

Does it run?

Let's see.

My dad used to have an old Ford.

Wow!

Is it yours?

Yeah.

Well....

I got the scarf.

We should take a road trip
across the country.

Doesn,t look like
you drive it much.

I used to.

When was the last time
you drove this thing?

The last time I drove it
I went to jail.

Car.

You went to jail?

For what?

Five years ago, I was on my way
to a press conference.

I had just signed a contract with
a new soccer team.

You played soccer?

Everything happened so fast.

Two, one....

Ready or not, here I come.

Cheese!

Sweetie this is the part
where you're supposed to hide.

Luchee I can see you.

I see you.
I see you.

We're gonna play this game a lot
when we go to your grandmother's.

And she has horses
and pigs and cows.

Moo, that's right.

Okay, Luchee, ready to play again?

Yes.
Okay.

I'm gonna count.

Nine...eight...seven....

Mommy!

Four, three...

...one!

Where are you?

Luchee?

Where are you?

I'm coming.

Luce?

Luchee!

Luchee!

Standing in the middle of the street,
looking down at her little body.

Somebody call an ambulance!

Somebody help me!

I live with it every day, Nina

You!!

It was you!

I can still hear her crying

and screaming for God to
give her daughter back.

Why?!

You killed her!

When I saw her mother holding,
holding her dead child....

I was convicted on
involuntary manslaughter.

My brother Manny was there
all the time with me.

What about her family?

She was a single mother.

They took four years of my life,
and I took everything she had.

I tried to meet with her several times,
but she refused.

I know all she sees in me is
the one who killed her little baby.

But it was an accident.
It doesn't matter, Nina.

It doesn't matter.

What matters is that
I took her daughter's life.

Hey, bro!

Que paso?

And Nina, all right.

Are you guys ready to
meet the love of my life?

I think this is it, hermano.

I'm going to marry her.

How long have you guys
been together?

A week.

They want you in the kitchen.

All right.

I promised you a bath.

It's good to see you again.

Nina, right?

Right.

So the two of you
took the day off?

I was kind of fired today.

Yeah, I heard.

I spoke to Manny.

I'm sorry.

You shouldn't take it
personally though.

Do you need to borrow any clothes,
because you could try some of mine.

No, thank you.

Everything I need
is right in here.

I just have to freshen up a bit.

Jose, Nina, Veronica
''Suviran,'' mi novia.

Nice to meet you.
Veronica Kustella.

It's nice to meet you.
You too.

Novia?

Novia means girlfriend.

Futura esposa
means future wife.

Eduardo is loco.

He's trying to teach me Spanish.

Some tequila?
No.

No, no, no.

Family custom, yes.

Jose?
No, gracias.

Come on, hermano.

Veronica?

Thank you.

Are we going to toast?

Shall we say grace?
Want to say grace?

Veronica and I are going to say Grace.

You ready?

Repeat after me.

This is for Veronica.

Thank you.

Sorry.

Great job!

Now we can toast.

Do you like oysters?

That was good, Dad!

I love oysters.

One time I dove into this river,
in my ranch in Mexico...

...and when I dove in my legs
were sticking out of the water...

...and my whole head
was stuck in mud.

I found out the river
was only three feet deep.

Manny had to come to my rescue
and pull me out by my legs...

...and when he pulled me out
an oyster shell cut my arm.

stitches.

If I had moved my arm
inches to the right...

...this scar would
have been right on my face.

And beautiful Veronica
wouldn't be here.

Why wouldn't I be here?

Because I wouldn't be as handsome.

Anyway, so, Manny fired you
because you were late?

And, you, you walked out on him, today?

Manny fired me too,
before I even started working.

You never showed up for work.

Manny needs to learn how to cook, anyway.

He's too busy cracking
the whip like El General.

El General up on his fine horse.

We should get a statue and put
it in front of the restaurant.

You should take Manny as an example.

He's worked hard all his life.

He started from zero
and look where he is now.

Unlike you.

I don't normally share this,

but in the early years,
we couldn't have children.

We tried.

We tried hard.

We did everything we could, but--

Mom, don't mention such things
in front of the children.

And then when we were about to
give up one of his cousins

back in Puerto Rico
was a social worker...

...and before we knew it we
had adopted this beautiful baby.

He was not even three years old.

A really precious boy.

I think the only difference
between my three sons

is the way
that Manny came to us.

Soccer.

I don't play soccer.

You play soccer?

I'm sorry.

He's saying you can't play soccer
without passion.

This man has never wanted to
learn English in his whole life.

Have you?

I understand what he's saying.

He understands a lot
more than you think.

Don't you?

Well, it's getting late.

I need to get back to the city.

You, Jose, eh, stay here.

You see how he speaks English?

He doesn't because he's lazy.

But he's right.

You should stay here and rest.

Thank you, but I, I really can't.

Take care.

I need to go home.

Let's go to the beach first.

And then we'll go from there.

Sure.

This is for you.

I never saw anything like this...before.

My father made them.

I mean, I think he has
too much time on his hands.

I just adore him.

He is so great.

Is he from Mexico?

No.

My father is from Puerto Rico
and my mother is from Mexico.

So I am a Rico-Mex.

It means half Puerto Rican,
half Mexican.

It's all the same to me.

So is it always like that?

I mean, did you grow up with that?

What?

Joy? Love?

Oh, that's nothing.

I mean, when my whole family
gets together, whew, muchacha!

I mean, it's really crazy.

The food, the music, the dancing,
the salsa, merengue.

It's beautiful.

What does Manny feel about people
knowing he's adopted?

To us, it doesn't make a difference.

You are seriously lucky.

You have a good family.

How about your family?

My dad passed away
when I was twelve.

No brothers or sisters.

So that's my family.

Here.

Thank you.

What about your mom?

After he died she just
kind of sat on the couch

with the remote and
never moved on.

I raised myself.

And her.

How was it dealing with
your dad's death?

I don't know.

I don't remember what the
twelve year old in me was feeling.

I think that my mom
took it so hard

that I didn't get the chance to
grieve, in a healthy way.

It was like I had to
take care of her, you know?

At first,
it brought us closer together

but I eventually turned into
the typical teenager

and all that grief
turned into resentment.

One night,
I got stoned out of my mind.

I went home, walked in her room

and there she was watching TV.

I looked at her and
started laughing at her.

Pointing right in her face.

She just sat there.

And I started to cry.

I told her how much
I miss my dad, too.

That I know that she's in pain
where I was in pain, too.

And it was like for the
first time she saw me again.

She stood up and held me.

Then I got the munchies.

And we ate some doughnuts and
talked about him all night.

The next morning, I woke up
and felt like I had a mom again,

but it was too late.

When I was eighteen,
my mom held out her hand.

She waved her wedding ring
at me this tiny stone

my dad probably
got at a pawn shop.

She said, ''You need to
get you one of these.''

She loved him so much
she never took that ring off.

That's what I want, Jose.

I want to bring a child
into this world out of love...

...with a man who's
gonna take care of us.

I don't have that.

I can't have this baby
and watch it suffer with me.

I don't know what I'm doing.

I'm gonna need a friend next week.

Here.

I want you to keep it.

Thank you.

You're gonna come with me, right?

You know what,
don't worry about it.

I'll be fine.

I'll call you.

I'll call you, okay?

Let's talk about the salmon,
the special I want to come up with.

Asparagus, mushroom, cactus.

I'm gonna throw in some avocado,
some mango.

Manny.

You're gonna do what?

Okay, let's go.

You can always take a piece of
the ocean with you.

How?

When you take a seashell home,
you put it right to your ears

and you can hear the ocean.

You want to try it?

Sure.

Okay.

One, two, three.

Here. Try.

I can't hear it yet.

Oh, well,
you're at the ocean.

But when you leave the ocean,
then you can hear it.

I can hear it now.
You can hear now?

Perfect.

How do I look?
You look beautiful.

Here she comes.

Okay. Let's go.

Do you know who I am?

You're my mama.

I brought this for you.

That was the last gift
my father gave to me.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Jose thank you so much.

I'm sorry.

Thank you. Thank you.
