Oh, that is fantastic.

Oh, shit! Get the fuck out.

COLLIN: Oh.
You got a vegan burger.

Why the fuck would they

TANNER: Sorry,

If you want a beef patty,
you have to specify meat.

Why? Why the fuck...
It's okay. We don't have to...

It's all right. It's really okay.

Not everything's a fight.

Dude runs up past the truck and
then the cops came up, shot him.

Is he dead?
Oh, yeah, he dead.

They shot him like four times.

MILES: I mean, that don't
necessarily mean he dead.

Not like they shot him 14 times like
that motherfucker out in Milwaukee.

Miles, not helpful!
What was that dude's name?

What was his name
though? I'm trying to...

It was like...
Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm good.

MILES: Yeah.

Oh. Oh. Oh. Okay. Okay, all right.

ASHLEY: Go! Come on, come on, come on!
Give him the right. Right.

Whop on his head. Just like that.

All right, well,
little Thug Life right here

is about to be late
to school again.

Only 'cause you're not
sending him to the preschool

down the street like I told you
to, he'd have been there already.

Yeah, well, where he needs to go is
Centro Vida preschool in Berkeley.

Centro Vida preschool is $200 more a
fucking week. Are you kidding me?

Well, that's because
it's the only

bilingual preschool
that I can get to on the train.

Why he need
to be bilingual?

He already biracial.
Oh, my God, come on.

SEAN: That's how you do it!
(GROANS)

Just use all that mouthpiece

to get us some fancy
preschool money. Okay?

Fine.
That's it.

It's all right. We're fine.
(SEAN YELLS)

Ow!
But I gotta talk to you about something serious.

What?
Why my hands are so cold this morning.

I can't go to work
with these cold hands.

I'ma need to warm them up on that
ass of yours just for a second.

Oh, my God.
But your hands are so cold!

MILES: Just for a second.

ASHLEY: You are ridiculous.
MILES: Right there.

(SIGHS)
I know. I know. I know.


You feel better?
It's so nice.

What am I supposed to do? It's just...
I bet. I bet it is so nice.

It's a privilege.

Hey, hey, hey.
What's up, Collin?

What's up, Miles?

NEWSCASTER: <i>After a pursuit

<i>a dramatic standoff with police

This the shit you saw?

<i>He was evading arrest by fleeing down
Adeline Street towards West Grand...</i>

You see this cop?
Yeah, I saw him.

<i>...police officers fired
four shots, killing the man.</i>

Why the fuck is he wearing
his hat all low?

Why would you take

This cop see you?
COLLIN: Yeah.

Hey, bro, let me get

What, then you just left?

I mean, it was after 11:00.
What I'm supposed to do?

James always be talking that shit.
But you're a witness.

You're not gonna leave like

Oh, yeah. "Hello, police?

"I'd like to report
a murder you did.

"I was out after curfew.
Yeah, I'm a convicted felon."

All right.
"Back to jail?

"Yeah, tomorrow

"Fo sho. Mmm-hmm.

"Yup. Okay."


Bro, what the fuck is this green
juice shit doing up in here?

It's good for you.

How much?

Let me get one.
I'm sorry, what?


(DOOR OPENS)

VAL: All right, we are all set. Thank
you so much for choosing Commander.

<i>Namaste,</i> Val.

Your aura is looking
very transcendent this morning.

Did you finally purge yourself of
your superiority complex or...

No, you're still...
Still working on it? Okay.

Oh, is that a green juice?
Is it? Oh. Oh, yeah.

I guess it is. You know, it's just
part of my regimen these days.

A little green juice, a little,
what's that class you be taking?

SoulCycle.
SoulCycle.

Yeah, a little...
My soul is so...

Shit.

(CHUCKLES)
Ah... It's healthy.

I am just glad you're
taking care of yourself.

Most definitely.

Um...

Collin was involved
in a shootout

last night with the police.
What?

I wasn't... That's not true.
That's not what happened.

He's not...
Who were you out...

No, Miles... Miles!
Very exciting. People died.

Who were you out with?
He's just fucking with you, babe.

Uh, sorry, Val. Front desk girl.
(PHONE RINGING)

Person. Front desk, front desk person.
Get going.

I'm going now.
Thank you for calling Commander,

where we strive for excellence
in relocations...

Fuck Val! Fuck Val.

She disloyal, she uppity,

and she permanently

That ain't my fault.

Motherfucker, you're bugging.
That's his ex-girl.

Yorkie, stop saying bugging.
You live on the West Coast now.

You're a Californian.
Get with the fucking program.

Hey, Miles. You bugging.
(ALL LAUGHING)

Shut the fuck up,
Tel! Shut the fuck up!

Hey, she got
this nigga a job,

and she lets you guys
both drive the truck home.

Come on, get out this boy's head.
Thank you, Tel.

She gotta let us drive the
truck to and from work.

That's how we get
to and from work, man.

She's... I'm not saying she's not smart.
She plenty smart.

I'm just saying it's a shame
she only uses that intelligence

toward being
a higher caliber of bitch.

That's all I'm saying.
You got to simmer.

Simmer, man.

Hey, he only defending her 'cause
he like that vegan Kwik Way pussy

that he giving her.
That's the whole shit.

ALL: Oh!

PATRICK: Okay, there's Leon.

Cynthia. Marvin.

Where's Vivian? Such an
evasive little firecracker.

Oh, no, no,

Don't have Santiago and Dante
facing each other.

They... They do not
get along. Please.

My work looks to make people
fall in love.

So I love trees?

That's from my last exhibit.

I superimposed
photographs of oak trees

over neighborhoods
where they used to grow,

to remind people
that they used to be everywhere.

Now they're just
on the damn street signs.

Oh, boys,
they're chopping us down.

These people were all forced out
for the new Oakland.

Which is why faces.

Eyes. To stare is to see.

Come on. Come here for a minute.

Just stare at each other
for a moment.

Oh, no, man,
we're close enough.

We got kinda like a Calvin
and Hobbes thing going on.

This isn't sexual.

See, but now it is,
'cause how you said that.

This is about finding the soul.

I know. Okay. All right.
All right. Okay. All right. Okay.

PATRICK: Look.
Fuck, your eyes match your jumpsuit.

Don't talk about the emeralds.
Look deep.

Connect.

Understand.

Fucking,
don't fucking do it!


Oh, look, Patrick,
you a swell motherfucker, man,

and I dig everything about you,
except that shit right there.

I'm sorry. (LAUGHS)

Yes, I got it already.

Hey, man, you gonna
have to move your car, bruh.

We got to get out.

Bruh, you gotta move,
boy! Let's go!

Look at this fucking transplant.
What's he doing?

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Hey, Mom.
Move your shit, bruh!

Oh, you're not gonna listen?
You don't hear me?

COLLIN: Yeah,

MILES:
He's just ignoring me.

COLLIN: He said hi.
Move, bruh!

Yo, I think we could
be there in like...

Fifteen minutes.
MILES: Are you kidding me right now?

(HORN BLARING)

Hey! Hey! Do you hear

Mom, I gotta go.

(SOUL MUSIC PLAYING)

(MEN SCREAMING IN VIDEO GAME)

Who is this little homie?

COLLIN: Me think

Why is he drinking
out of your dinosaur mug

you made in fifth grade?

Mugasaurus.


MILES: You just gonna let him
drink out your mug like that?

You just gonna let him
do that, Collin?

Mom! Mom!

NANCY: I'm in the bathroom, sir!

What? My... You... That's my...
This is my room!

You gave him my room?
NANCY: I know.

Mom! He is living in my room?

NANCY: This is why I told you to come
over so we could talk about what your,

you know, long-term plan is.
Ma! I am moving home in two days!

NANCY: You really couldn't
find an apartment?

The whole damn city
got a "For Rent" sign on it.

"Have you ever been
convicted of a felony?

"If so, what is the nature
of your crime?"

Well, whose fault is that?
Damn.

Well, I just assumed you'd only
be here for a little bit.

And eventually you and Val...
Mom. Mom.

She came by
a couple of days ago.

We are not together right now.

Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay.

Well, Jimmy and all my drums
are in guest room A now.

Yeah, I saw that.
NANCY: Clear the rest of Shanai's stuff

off her old bed and you can
have that room for a bit.

But that is not your room.
That is my guest room B.

Where is your sister anyway?

Shanai's in Bali

teaching non-Eurocentric
beauty techniques.

Right on, right on.

Hmm. Took out a second mortgage on
this house to send her to school.

I'm going to be paying it off
for the rest of my life.

Well, why don't you just
sell the house then?

She is not going to sell our house.
I am not selling my house.

I'll be damned if I move out
of this neighborhood

now that they got
good food and shit.

Oh.

Give this to his better half.
Yeah.

Tell her it's from me, please.
Okay.

What is that?
Get your hand out of my pocket.

Something for Ashley and my godson.
And you'll just lose it.

You're not wrong.

Hey, baby.
Hey.

Hey, hey, hey, look at
this good-looking man!

Hey, what's happening, Marty?
Oh!

How you doing, bro?
I'm good, man.

Staying out of trouble?
Yeah, man, I'm good.

Hey, what's up, Marty?
Hey, what's up?

Nancy, uh, can I have this?
NANCY: What?

Whatcha gonna do with those?

(HAIR DRYER WHIRRING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Flat irons! Top of
the line, metallic,

heat-absorbent, alloy metal.

Uh-uh.

Who the fuck said you could
talk in Mama Liz's shop?

WOMEN: Mmm-hmm.

Oh, shit.

This is finnabit a show
you want to watch.

We've got ceramic and titanium,
some for home, some for travel.

Wide plates for long weaves,

short plates for thinking
about going all natural.

Boy, please.
Those look old.

These are from the cosmetology
school after just one class.

Out the box,
but not quite out of gas.

They use the best to teach
the worst to become the best,

and the best is right here
and that's what you deserve,

so forget the rest.
I mean, come on, people!

WOMAN:
I don't know about that.

Well, you haven't even
told me how much yet.

And Mama Liz
does not enjoy suspense.

I don't even like suspense movies.
I don't either.

Fuck Alfred Hitchcock!
WOMAN: Right on.

Fuck him.
And M. Shyamalan Night...

That motherfucker
could kiss my ass too.

Makes me nervous.
WOMAN: There's always a twist.

Let me ask you something.

How much is that one
you're holding right now?

$140.
$140? I would never!

These have gotta be at least
a third of the price of that,

and, hand to God,
I bet they work better.

Okay.

Who the fuck is this white boy
y'all let in my shop?

Tina!
What?

I'm just a West Oakland
homegrown Bay boy

about his town business.

Matter of fact, 100% of the
proceeds today are actually going

towards bilingual education
for the youth of Oakland.

And it's gonna help men
transitioning out of incarceration

towards finding a better life
and having a second chance.

Because that
is what our community

so desperately needs.

(WOMEN AGREEING) -I feel it, you feel
it, we all feel it, we all know it.

Come on.

WOMAN 2: They all deserve
a second chance.

Here we go.
WOMAN 3: It's on now.

WOMEN: Ooh...

How we know these work?

I think it look good.

You know,
it is so uncomfortable

to have to fit this shit
on my belt, man.

Oh, right. Plausible deniability ruined.
Thank you.

Shut up.
Thank you very much.

That reminds me, man.

Made $600.
$300 is very much yours.

No, bruh, you keep that for La
Raza preschool or whatever.

How do you mean? You know
how family work, man.

I got some, you got some.
Whatcha talking about?

(CELL PHONES CHIME)

You just get this text
about Nak's co-worker's party?

Yeah, you trying to go?

Nope.
Nope.

ASHLEY: Yo, Miles!

Miles, can you please
come upstairs?

Well, hello, Collin's perm!

That looks fucking terrible.
Thank you.

I mean, if you gonna perm,
why don't you go

wherever your mom or Val went?

I wasn't... Come on.
Nancy's hair looks great.

The hell you doing
talking to Val for?

<i>Calmate!</i> I didn't break
the picket line, nigga.

I just follow her
on social medias.

You could all be friends
with Val still.

She's like
a really good person.

No, the fuck we can't!

Fuck Val!
Okay. Wow.

And, baby, unfollow Val
on the medias!

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

Hi.

Um, I had to take
my hair out today for...

For this something and...

Now I need to get it braided
back again before tomorrow.

Okay.

And you're the only one who can
get it done before 11:00.

Why's it have
to get done by...

Right. Why'd you take
your hair out?

It was profitable to do so.

Look, I'm really not trying
to make this a us thing.

I just really have to get
my hair braided.

Fine. Let's do it
at your mom's house, okay?

I have to return
a bowl anyway.

And this is my study time, so you
need to help me memorize stuff.

It has to actually
be study time.

COLLIN: "The tendency to judge
the strength of arguments

"based on the plausibility
of their conclusions,

"rather than how strong it is."

Belief bias effect.

Yes. Okay.
Next.

"The tendency to attribute
one's own actions

"to external causes while attributing
other people's behaviors

"to internal causes."
Blame gaming. Blame gaming.

You blame the game.
It's actor observer bias.

Yes.
Yes!

What are you saying
before the answer?

Oh, you're gonna love this.
This is absolutely your fault.

I love that.
(CHUCKLES)

I made up, like, slang words
to help me remember things.

Oh, shit. Look at you out here innovating.
See, she is still town. I knew it.

I'm still town.
Who said I'm not town?

Nah, I mean, people just be saying
things on the street, girl...

But it's cool. (CHUCKLES)

What, uh, what is this vase one?

Oh, you see a vase?
Why you say it like that?

It's two faces though!

"Rubin's vase. The image is
fundamentally ambiguous.

"People perceive
a vase or faces,

"but not both at the same time."

All right, so apparently
you like vases.

Oh, I got you. Facevasin.
(LAUGHS)

Facevasin'. No, try it out.
No. You...

Facevasin'.

You can't just
keep saying it...

Facevasin'.
...and think it's gonna...

It's gotta be like real slang
so it'll stick in my head.

I'm sprinkling it though.
Facevasin'.

(LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES)

Hey.
What?

You know I'm a free bird
tomorrow, right?

Yes, I do know.
Mmm-hmm.

I'm happy for you.
Me too.

You gonna hang out of car windows
and curse at people then too?

Why would I do that?
I don't know. You tell me.

I got a complaint today
that one of our trucks

was just honking and yelling at people.
A black guy with dreads was

just screaming at everyone.
Nah, nah, nah, that's...

You don't have all the information.
Okay.

So what happened, Miles was
honking the horn because...

Miles.
There was a dude

that wouldn't get...
Wait, Miles was honking?

He was the one who was
honking the horn.

We set it up so you would be the driver.
I was driving the truck. I know.

No, I was... Nah.
We talked about this.

I was driving.

Keep your head straight.
I was driving,

but if he reach across me

and honk the horn,
then what I'm supposed to do?

Collin, just take some
responsibility for the things

that are happening around you.

I'm not denying it.
I'm just saying

that maybe this time it wasn't
the black guy with dreads

that did it.



I know you're trying.

At least you don't wear
that fucking grill anymore.

Now if you could just

get rid of all this hair.

You'd almost look...
Like less blamable?

"Not the hair, bruh.
It's my identity, bruh."

It is.

Yeah, well, your identity
is (SIGHS) done.

And I gotta go.

I got it. Thanks.

Can we... Is that?
Yeah.

Thanks.
Okay.


Okay, this is why I didn't
want to come to your place.

NANCY: Collin!
It's 10:45, babe.

Thank you, Nancy!
NANCY: Sorry to interrupt.

Um...

Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

VAL: Bye.

(DOOR OPENS)


WOMAN: Really? Oh, wow.

MAN: That's great, yeah.

NEWSCASTER:
<i>More details tonight</i>

<i>on last night's police
shooting in West Oakland.</i>

<i>The man killed by police has been
identified as Randall Marshall.</i>

<i>A foot chase took place down</i>

<i>Adeline Street in West Oakland.</i>
MILES: Oh, here we go.

They gonna... Watch, they gonna use
his professional police photo.

And they gonna use...

Oh, come on!
Use bruh's work photo!

Got him
in the orange jumper!

They couldn't find one picture
of bruh in his own shit?

Calm down! Chill out!
That's so disrespectful.

Man, you can't find another...
He's just asleep.

They can't find...
We just got him to sleep.

<i>The recent felon was carrying
an unlicensed concealed weapon.</i>

Felon, convicted felon.

Wrong cocktail, my G.

You gets no protest.

<i>Marshall was running towards
West Grand Avenue</i>

<i>away from Officer Molina,</i>

<i>who fired four shots,
killing him.</i>

<i>Marshall lived on 32nd Street
with his girlfriend</i>

<i>and three-year-old daughter.</i>

You're late, Mr. Hoskins.
(YELPS)

You just stand there all day?

Isn't this something
we could automate?

You want a robot telling you
to mop the bathroom?

How about a robot
that just mops the bathroom?

Then I can go get some sleep.
Solutions oriented.

See, I like that.
Even better.

How about motherfuckers just don't
get arrested for dumb shit?

I see where we're going here, but
if we could just get to it...

Then I don't have to enforce
seemingly arbitrary tasks

to establish your ability to follow
rules as a representation of law.

Arbitrary. That's the
word right there.

Don't make me write you up
for your last week.

The judge will extend
your time here a year.

And then your little map
box sentence starts over.

Convicted on
dirty bathroom charges?

You are now a convicted felon,

Mr. Hoskins.

You are now that
until proven otherwise.

Prove otherwise at all times.

Got it.

What's going on? What's up?
Hey, yo.

MILES: Matter of fact, Ashley was
just telling me it's 80K a year,

starting salary for OPD, but they
don't even hire in the town.

So the person who pulls you over
is actually from, like, Cupertino

or some shit.
Why not just live in Oakland?

They probably worried that if
somebody knew where they lived,

somebody'd come shoot them
for all the dumb shit they do.

I don't know. Hey, bro,
let me get a square, bruh.

What? Nigga,
can I better myself?

Can I be courageous?

You gonna end up
listening to vinyl

with a wooden tie and suspenders
with a gluten allergy,

He auditions them in the car.
Where's the board?

I'm adding a move.
I will give it to Collin.

I hope it's moving you off

Hi.


Your braids look good.
Who did them for you?


It just kinda does this

Yeah, it must be all the healthy
living got me looking so good.

You know, my natural state.

You know, there's more to healthy living
than just drinking kale smoothies.

Yeah, I know.
I'm just saying,

'cause you have some major
lifestyle things to...

It was a joke, Val.
I know what healthy living is.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.

I was just...

Hmm?

Val came over to Mom's house,

What is your problem with Val?

Val is a disloyal bitch.

When you were in jail, did
she put money on your books?

Uh, did she come visit you even one
time at Rita while you were locked up?

'Cause I'm pretty sure
I went two times a week,

45 minutes each way.

$500 on your book on day one!
Hey, she talked to me on the phone.

How gracious of her
to have called you once.

And what did she want
to talk to you about?

About changing up your lifestyle?
Changing up your ways?

You're not a thug,
drug dealer!

You went to jail
on a fire technicality.

Did I?
Yes!

How were we supposed to know

Hey, Cuttie!

Maybe she lives here.

Yo, uh, excuse me, bruh.

Did you used to work
the door at The Alley?

Yeah.

That was like a minute ago.
Yeah, you did. Oh, shit, bro!

This is that motherfucka with
the Scorpion Bowl at The Alley

What dude
with the Scorpion Bowl?

RIN: I never told you

This is him!

We really don't have

Yeah, we do. Okay, okay, okay.

You know The Alley, right?

Yeah. It's an institution.
Oh, my God, this story is so fuckin' dope!

I'm looking fly,</i>

<i>when this Colorado white boy
saunters up to the bar.</i>

<i>He's like, "Wassup, bruh?
Get me one of those."</i>

<i>And he orders
the Scorpion Bowl.</i>

<i>This thing is like a giant
swimming pool of fucking booze</i>

<i>with a flame in the middle.</i>

<i>It's like a white person's
wet dream.</i>

<i>This dude sees
the Scorpion Bowl,</i>

<i>and, like, he grows hair on his

Hey, listen up, everybody!

It's Scorpion time!

Meanwhile, this nigga right
here... Uh, excuse me.

This gentleman.
You can only say that with me.

Yeah, my bad. I was out
of my mind right then.

<i>This dude right here is just
standing outside working the door,</i>

<i>looking hella fresh,
might I add.</i>

<i>There's this white boy on the
stool and he's like hella hard.</i>

<i>You know what I'm saying?
He got tatted up.</i>

<i>He's looking grizzled.</i>

<i>Now I'm blowing a cigarette.</i>

I thought that you said that...
I'ma gonna quit.

I'm gonna fucking quit, I know. All right?
Just leave me alone.

I'm so sorry. He keeps
interrupting me.

<i>So anyway, Jason Biggs
busts through the door,</i>

<i>and he's like,
"Guys, guys, guys!</i>

<i>"Look at this
fucking fire drink.</i>

<i>"It's fucking insane."</i>

<i>But then my dude steps up,
and he's like,</i>

<i>"Hey, bruh, you can't
bring alcohol out here.</i>

<i>"You gotta take that
back inside."</i>

<i>Motherfucka Topher Grace
responds,</i>

<i>"Calm down. I'm just gonna show
my friends for like two seconds,"</i>

<i>"then I'm gonna go back
inside, okay?</i>

<i>"And if I don't
and you lose your job,</i>

<i>"I'll get you a new job, dawg."</i>


What?
Right?

Now, shit gets bad.
TIN: Now it gets bad?

'Cause you a bad man.
You know what I'm saying?

So he's like,
"The fuck you say?"

<i>"I'll go back inside, right?
I'll go back inside."</i>

<i>My man stops him like,</i>

<i>"You're done. Give me
the fucking goblet thing."</i>

<i>"First of all,
it's a Scorpion Bowl, okay?</i>

<i>"And second, no!</i>

<i>"I fucking paid
for this thing."</i>

<i>And then he slaps his arm.</i>

Remember the white boy on the stool?
On the stool? Yeah.

Guess what?
He's a fucking psycho.

<i>'Cause he's like,</i>

<i>"Hey, you better know
where you're at, fuckboy,</i>

<i>"before some real town shit
happen to you."</i>

<i>And then, Neil Patrick Harris
pushed him.</i>

Hard!

Would you ever push this dude?
I would not.

<i>And they're just beating

<i>you know what I'm saying?</i>

<i>And it's a fucking menage

Now, mind you,

that drink is still on fire.

TIN: <i>Oh, I forgot

RIN: <i>It is still burning.</i>

<i>That fire catches some of
that alcohol and ignites.</i>

<i>And now that flame's rolling,

You need to get rid of Miles.

Miles is my best friend.
Yeah, is he?

'Cause I know you guys
grew up together,

but he's gonna put you back in jail
or he's gonna get you fucking killed.

Miles had my back
since we were 11 years old.

When I went to jail,

Miles came and saw me
all the time.

I'm not talking about this with you again.
He came to visit you out of guilt.

'Cause he pushed you into a fight,
and he didn't go to jail with you.

What if that dude had had a gun?

What if Miles' dumb ass
had a gun?

What if the cops showed up

and they saw you
stomping that white dude?

Look who the fuck I am?

That's how the fuck
I survive out here!

You wanna act brand-new,

Go ahead. Be a hipster,
get a tech job or some shit.

And go act like you don't know
where the fuck you from!

I ain't got to prove to nobody
where the fuck I'm from!

Oh, good for you!

Nigga, you got something
to prove to everybody!

Yeah? That's 'cause I'm livin' somewhere
where now everybody got me fucked up!

You ain't gotta do shit!
You ain't gotta...

You ain't gotta worry about you changing
up your clothes or your lifestyle.

You ain't gotta worry
about none of that shit!

You're a big black dude

with fucking braids
in Oakland!

Nobody is misreading you,
Collin.

Yeah.

Yeah, I know.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Yeah?

Yeah, my nigga.
Yeah, bruh.

Nope. Say it.

What?

Say "nigga."

Oh, fuck you!
Say it!

Say, "Yeah, my nigga!"

No, and you know...
Why? Why?

Come the fuck on!
But... But why?

'Cause you know
I don't say that shit!

But what? So it's okay for me
to call you nigga, nigga?

You been calling me that since
we were fucking 12 years old.

I'm not gonna stop you now.
Do what the fuck you want to,

say what you want to say.
Nigga, if that is so disrespectful,

then why is it okay
for me to call you that?

You're a fucking nigga!

You're a fucking nigga, Miles!
Why are we talking about...

You out here acting an ass

like it ain't no fucking
consequences for that shit.

And every nigga who sees me
thinks that I do the same

dumb, fuckin' ignorant,
gun-carrying shit that you do!

But I've been taking care
of my shit!

I fucking... Don't I do
our timecards every week?

I pick us up. I keep you
out of dumb shit,

and then what do you do?

You go out and you buy
a fucking gun for what?

For your family?

You are the nigger that
they are out here looking for!


MILES: Where the fuck
you goin'?

Where the fuck are you goin'?

Collin!

Collin!

Well then, fuck you then!

You hear that?

Then, fuck you then!

You better not have no fuckin'
gun on you, 'cause...

Ow, Ash.
Shut up.

Ow, the shit's broken!
Shut up!

I got into a fucking fight! The fuck
you want me to do about it, huh?

You wanna fight
about the shit too?

You're picking the wrong
fights, all right?

This is already hard.
This is work. He is work,

and I don't feel like
you are here with me right now!

I didn't buy that gun
on no tough shit, all right?

I know why you thought
you needed to buy a gun!

Just let me ask you something.

Were you afraid

when you came out here

and saw Sean holding a gun?

Yes.

And do you think

if you would have possibly told
me about buying a gun

that I might have seen
the scenario coming?

I'm sorry. I didn't...

I'm sorry.

Well, maybe if you niggas weren't
so wild all the fuckin' time.

Could you not call me that?

What, "nigga"?

Yeah, can you not
call me that, please?

Okay.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

Hi.

Hi.

Um...

How's the...

How's the memorizing coming?

Yeah, just trying to
learn these psych terms.

What did you come up with

for the double picture one?

The face and the vase one?

Oh, I like that one.

It was "blindspotting."

Why "blindspotting"?

'Cause it's all about how
you can look at something,

and there can be another thing
there that you aren't seeing.

So you got
a blind spot.

But if somebody points out

the other picture to you,

doesn't that make it

not a blind spot anymore?

No, 'cause you can't
go against

what your brain wants
to see first.

Unless you spend the time to retrain
your brain, which is hella hard,

so you're always gonna
be instinctually blind

to the spot
you weren't seeing.

Collin?

When you look at me now,

do you always see

the fight first?

(SIREN WAILS)

We gotta go straight to the

I got the address
from the office.

Just gotta put my shoes on.
Come on.

Nah, I'm good out here.

Fine.

Congratulations, Collin.

COLLIN: Thank you, Sean.

It's real nice
of you, bruh.

(PUNCHING)
Ow, okay.

Okay. It's not
a good time. Sean.

Sean, all right, cut it out.

Sean, all right, enough.

I'm serious.
Sean, enough.

Enough. Hey! Hey, stop!

Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

ASHLEY: What did he just say?

Oh, are you outside
practicing with Collin?

He's a little too young for the
pamphlets that your mama gave us,

but I'm trying to
get ahead early.

(TRUCK DOOR OPENS)

Good morning.
Commander Moving for Rachel.

So, it's just a ton of boxes
in the living room, mostly.

Uh, my son and I
are gonna take off,

but my, um, husband is inside
somewhere if you wanna go...

MILES: Okay, so everything
is just in here then?

Yes.
(ALARM BEEPING)

Um...

I canceled the service,

but it beeps by default

Huh?

COLLIN: What? Nigga, I'm just...

I'm just talking to him!

Ha!

You said

It's the bounce of it. They like

Like a tree on a sign, nigga,

Paul Bunyan-ass cops,

at the knees

and search the trunk
in my own town.

Did you count his rings
when you bled him?

Huh?

When you dead him?

Do you understand?
How old was he?

Nigga, how old was he?

He was 26.
Twenty-six?

That's how many years you
decided didn't mean shit.

All this talking
don't mean shit.

I mean, shit!

The difference
between me and you is...

I ain't no killer.


I ain't no killer.

I didn't mean to.

Are you sure?

You good?

No.

Yeah.


Well, our next move is...

Heather Neel
in the hills, so...

You got anything else you
wanna get off your chest,

I feel like now's a good time,
'cause I don't think we can

point another gun
at a customer,

I feel like we get,
like, one of those a day,

or a week or never.

(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

You pulling guns on people
and I'm driving?

Everything is
upside down today, man.

Whatcha want me to drink
this green juice too, huh?

That make you feel better?

I'll drink it, man.
I'll... I'll drink this shit.


Fuck it, man. Fuck it.

Make you happy?
Mmm-hmm.

Oh, it smells disgusting.
Fuck.

Son-of-a-bitch,

COLLIN: Fuck, man. (LAUGHS)

That shit ain't bad.

That's like the initial shock.
It get better then.

This is so green, you know?
It's so green.

Okay. (LAUGHS)

COLLIN: A'ight,
who's the next move?

It's Heather Neel.

Oh, shit. (CHUCKLES)

That's Derek Carr's
girlfriend.

Who's that?
Quarterback of the Raiders.

Oh, hell, no!
That's the next move?

Oh, it's my time
to air out now, boy!

Shit, I'm gonna give her
a piece of my mind

about her lil boyfriend.

He a town traitor,
as far as I'm concerned.

I mean, how the Raiders
gonna move to Las Vegas?

Unacceptable!

COLLIN: So what, y'all fucks
with the Raiders now?

MILES: Don't be absurd,
Collin.

That would be
disloyal of me to do.

I can't stoop to their level.
(LAUGHING)

I'm just mad at them forcing me
into this very confusing position.

COLLIN: Uh-huh.
MILES: Loyalty is tricky, Collin. It's a moving target.

COLLIN: Bet you wish you
were a better moving target.

MILES: You tryin' to talk
about my face, bruh?

(COLLIN LAUGHS)
Too soon, man!

COLLIN: <i>Hey,

MILES: <i>I am fucked up.</i>
