Come on.

Just fuck me.

Maybe we should wait.

Wait for what?

The next time
we see each other.

What?

Oh, now--

now I just feel like,
um-- like a whore.

That's no good.

Is this your go-to move
or something?

You just hook me in
and make me believe
that you're this gentleman.

I never said
i was a gentleman.

But I'm not playing games.

Well, sometimes
games can be fun.

Okay.

Let's do it.
Let's fuck.

No, it's too late.

It's too late.

I think--
i think you're right.

Let's wait.
It's a great idea.

Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

Maybe you could hold me down
while you do it.

Tighter.
Tighter?

<i> Jefe.</i>
Yeah.

Luis just finished
cleaning up.

What, you got a party
to go to?<i> ¿fiesta?</i>

<i> Sí.</i>

-Good night, frank.
-Good night, sweetheart.

I'm going
to the tiki bar later
if you wanna come.

Yeah. Maybe.
I'll let you know.

Ah,<i> merci.</i>

Happy Halloween.

Voilà.

Oh, my god.

Is that caviar?

Osetra.
From the black sea.

What else is in this?
This is...

Fucking incredible.

Crème fraîche.
French butter.

Sea salt. Chives.
Brioche bread.

<i>Actually, the name</i>
<i>of your place, rue galilée--</i>

<i>I lived on that block once.</i>

<i> Me too.</i>

<i> No shit.</i>

<i>It's where I learned</i>
<i>to cook when I was a kid.</i>

<i>Dropped out of high school.</i>

<i>Bought a plane ticket</i>
<i>with the money I saved up</i>
<i>baking pizzas in queens</i>

and flew to France.

What?

You're pretty cool,
frank.

Oh, I just love this Tequila.
It does wonders
for the nerves.

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

Lick.

Mmm!

This restaurant
is exquisite, frank.

And you are a doll
for arranging the reservation.

I was the sous chef
here for five years,
so they take care of me.

You still
haven't told me
why you're here.

Tina Turner
has a house in nice,

and<i> architectural digest</i>
is sending me to write about it.
Oh, wow.

I love
the south of France.

Tina has
a one-night-only show tonight,

so I'm getting a ride
on her jet tomorrow.

After Tina,
I'm off to Paris for some fun.

Where are you staying?

At Alan's spare flat.

Oh.

He sends his regards,
by the way.

Tell him
that I say hello.

So, Lola tells me that
you're classically trained.

I mean, I learned
on the job in France,
which I guess would qualify.

I didn't go to cooking school.
I started young.

-How young?
-Sixteen.

Mmm. Quite an image.

I can't wait
to taste your food.

It would be my pleasure.

Perhaps I can bring Wayne
before I leave tomorrow.

Wayne?
Newton.

Seriously?

He's absolutely lovely.

-Would you like to meet him?
-Yeah. I'll be there. Thanks.

-But I'll be
at school all day.
-Not my fault, Lola.

You don't need
to be there.

Mother.

What?

Stop being
patronizing.

Frank.

Was I being patronizing?

Yeah, you were.

But that's all right.

You okay?

What you did with my mom--
calling her out.

You really
looked out for me.
I'm not used to it.

Well, get used to it.

Good night, Lola.

Do you fall in love
easily, frank?

No. Do you?

I just don't think
I'm gonna be any good at this.

You know,

I've been married.

I'm sure she was the one,
even though I really
barely knew her.

And I dove right in.

Do it.

All I'm saying is

the way you're feeling
right now, this fear--

I'm with you.

She's coming? For real?

Your mother?
That's cool.
All right.

Well, listen.
I-- I, uh--

I know how to navigate
those waters.

So listen.
How about this?

How about
i take you both out?
You and your mother.

Right? 'Cause it's not every day
a girl graduates from college.
That's a big deal.

Well, I graduated
last month.
All right.

And she's doesn't like
insurance salesmen.

Wow. Whoa. Really?

Yeah, I don't
sell insurance, so...

Well, she's doesn't like men
who look like David schwimmer.

David schwimmer?
I am David schwimmer.

I'm just kidding.

So, you find a job yet?
'Cause that's tough, right?
Right out of college.

Well, there's not
much of a market for aspiring
fashion designers in Vegas

who don't make stripper heels
or thongs, so no.

You are mad funny.
Stripper heels.

I don't know though.
I wouldn't be so sure.

Oh, yeah?

There's a place
next door-- kvd.
You ever heard of it?

Yeah. There's one downtown.
Yeah. It's cool.
So check this out.

The owner's been
making a real effort
to showcase Vegas-based talent.

And so he set up
this fashion Incubator
to help him out with that.

If I come back
with you tonight and you see
where the night takes us,

then maybe you'll
introduce me to the owner.
No, but I will set you up

with the person
who decides who's gonna be
the designer for the Incubator.

-You know her?
-Do I know her? Yeah.
She works for me.

I'm the owner.

Oh.

Is your work
any good?

Yeah. Yeah. I, uh--
i just had my show,

my thesis show.
Oh, for real?

All right, well, yeah,
I'll set up
a studio visit.

You're not kidding.
No. I don't care
about that stuff, no.

Why are you
offering me this?

Maybe because
you're being mean to me,
and I like it.

Aha.
I like
a little sass.

And it's not
an offer, okay?

It's just an interview.
And I should make it clear

that I don't sleep
with anyone
who works for me.

I learned that lesson
the hard way.
There you go.

Keith winkleman.
That's right.

If you're interested,
call me on Monday,
all right?

If I'm interested,
then I will.

All right.

Hi, sweetie.

You're with Patricia?
No, she's still
up in her room.

I've been here
for over an hour.

Are you close by?
Yeah. Turn to your left.

Hello, handsome man.

-Who was the mook?
-The mook?

Yeah, that tool
that was trying to fuck you.

Come on.
He was harmless.

Ah, I guess it's fine.

You okay?

Well, they closed the deal.

So new owners, new chef,
new everything.

It's done.

I'm sorry.

Yeah.

You knew it was coming.

I'll be fine.

Yeah. Of course you will.

We're gonna miss
our reservation.

I'm gonna try shaming her
out of her room.

Hey.

You look beautiful.

Is it too late to make
an adjustment to the menu?

I was thinking
salmon might be
a nice second option.

Dinner's in two hours.

Yes.

That's not gonna happen.

Maybe we could just add
a second entrée option then.

Without meat.

No problem.

Yeah.

Okay, amazing.

I can't wait.
I'm really excited.

Do you wanna get
a drink afterwards?

I will try not
to be a fuck-up.

Okay.

You too. Bye.

Hey.
Hey.

Who was that?

My new boss.

What?

No, I got a job.

Wow. All right.
With who?

It's working
with this fashion Incubator,

and they just pay
young designers to come up
with clothes for their store.

Congratulations.

Thank you very much.

You're not working
for that douche bag, huh?

No. For this woman.

But it's
where he works, right?

He doesn't
work there.

He just owns the company.

Why didn't you tell me
you were up for it?
That's a little weird.

Because I thought
you'd be mad, which you are.

I'm not mad.
I just don't like that guy.

Why? He's been
very professional.

How was the banquet?

Little old rich ladies
who lunch.

They're killing me.
They booked me again.

That's-- that's
really good.
That's great.

It's catering.
Cooking for private parties
isn't catering.

You're working
almost every day.

But nobody knows
how to eat anymore. They
all want gluten-free salads.

I might as well
open a salad shop
and call it salad guy.

Exactly.

Hey.

Do me a favor.

Tell this, uh,
boss of yours--
what's his name?

He's not my boss.
Keith.
Keith.

Tell him
you're in love with a man

who owns an extremely
sharp set of knives.

I guess
we should celebrate.

Hey, gorgeous.
Hi.

Hey, uh,
will's picking us up
at 7:00, all right?

-He wants to be on the road
to la right after rush hour.
-I'll be on time. I promise.

Hey.

I love you.

Me too.

All right.
I got to go.
Okay. I'll see you at 9:00.

-What?
-I'm just kidding, dorko.
I'll see you at 7:00.

Dorko.

<i> This is Lola.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

You know what?
You guys should just go.

Stop. We will wait.
No, I got this.

It's okay. Go ahead.

If something's up,
we'll stick around.

Seriously,
you guys go ahead.
It's okay.

Are you sure?
-Yeah.

Hey.

Where were you?

Baby, you okay?

Um, I was--

what? What happened?

I-- I think
we should go inside.

Okay.

You need a, uh--

you want one?

Uh, no.

Honey, listen to me.

I know-- I know
you're upset, and--

do you want to have a seat?

I just wanna know you're okay.
I just wanna know what happened.
That's all.

Please?

Can you please have a seat?

Okay. All right. Here.

I-- I think that...

I made a mistake.

What kind of mistake?

Um--

hello.

<i> Hi. I'm looking</i>
<i> for the owner of this phone.</i>

One second.

I'm with her right now.

I'm sure
she'll be relieved.

<i> -May I speak with her?</i>
-By all means.

Who is it?

You.

Hello.

<i>I'm calling</i>
<i>from the concierge desk</i>
<i>at the hotel.</i>

<i>A guest said his girlfriend</i>
<i>left her phone in his suite.</i>

<i>Is that you?</i>

Yes.
<i>This number keeps popping up</i>

<i>as a missed call.</i>

<i>Hope your friend</i>
<i>doesn't mind we reached out.</i>

No, it's fine.

<i>And just for security purposes,</i>
<i>what hotel were you visiting?</i>

I was at the encore.
<i>That's us.</i>

<i>You can pick it up</i>
<i>at the concierge any time.</i>

<i>Have a lovely evening.</i>

The encore used to be
the desert inn.

Did you know that?

No.

Well, that was a little
before your time.

I was a saucier there
for five years
at the best restaurant.

Sometimes after work,
a rich woman would take me
up to her room, and...

The older ones,
they taught me
how to fuck.

Oh, yeah.
So I liked that hotel.

Stop.

"Stop"?

I'm just letting you know
that I have fucked
some very beautiful women.

Good ones. They don't worry
their mommy is gonna steal me
away from 'em.

Two hours ago,
i would've crawled
through glass for you.

And while
i was worried sick,
you were--

we're done.

No, frank.

You were only with me
'cause you can't be alone.

Right?
I was alone
when I met you.

Oh, yeah?
For what, 24 hours?
No.

Of course not.

So you wait till we're together
to start fucking dudes
in fancy hotel rooms.

Good plan.

Who was it?

It was-- it was no one.

It was--

-who was it?
-It was a guy
from California.

And he's already
left town.

You know, it was awful.
It was nothing.

It meant nothing.

I get it.

This is what you do, right?
I could be anyone.

It's not true.

You are incredible.

You're a real man.

Oh, my god.

Thank you.

A real man would walk
the fuck out of here.

No. Please.
I'm not gonna let you go
without a fight.

Ow!

Ow! Stop it.

You're hurting me.

Look at me.

Don't stare
at anyone.

Don't fucking walk
away from me.

Look at me when
I'm talking to you.
Ow!

What the fuck--

frank Riley?

Do you remember
when we had dinner
with my mother?

She said she was staying
with someone in Paris
called Alan.

Kind of. Why?

He's an old boyfriend
of hers.

And we lived with him
in Paris for a few years
when I was a kid.

And?

He raped me.

When was this?

Over the summer.

Before I came here.

I--

I'm sorry.

I thought I'd tell you.

No one else knows.

You didn't tell your mother?

I was afraid that she
wouldn't believe me.

You said his name is Alan?

Yeah.

What's his story?

Why?
Just tell me.

He comes from
a rich Swedish family
who lost all their money.

He moved to France
to start over from nothing.

Then he wrote
a book about it.

It was a hit.

He left my mom.

Found a rich wife.

She lets him do what he wants.

It's very, you know, French.

I'm not making an excuse
for what I did.

It's just what happened
had an effect on me

that I can't understand.

But you think
you wouldn't have done
what you did yesterday

if you hadn't--

if you hadn't, uh--

I guess. I-- I don't know.

It definitely, like,
fucked me up though.

Frank?

May I borrow you
for a moment?

Yeah. Sure.

This guys walks out,
and she gets so-- boils over,
and she follows him...

Every one,
this is frank Riley,

our chef.

I should get back.

Of course.

This is blah, blah, blah
from, you know-- from France
or whatever,

from some foreign country.
Excuse me.

Maybe she likes cheese.

Hey, hey,
lolita!

Hi.

Hello.

I should have known
that was your food.

You didn't get
my text?
No.

What are you doing here?

This is Keith's
partner's house.
You didn't know?

No. So, are you
that fucker's date?

Don't be ridiculous.

Oh, my god.
There he is.

Bro, you fucking
crushed it.

That was phenomenal.
Believe me,
i know about good food.

My dad owns fine-dining
restaurants in la,
so I grew up around it.

And that was one
of the best I've ever had.

Seriously. Incredible.

Glad you enjoyed it.

Keith winkleman.

Nice to meet you.

I'm sorry.
Was I interrupting something?
You guys know each other?

This is
my boyfriend,
frank Riley.

Frank, Keith.
Shut up.
You're kidding me.

You have a boyfriend,
and he cooks like this?
Are you kidding me?

Why didn't you tell me
about this guy?
This dude's amazing.

Frank,
what are you doing here?
Excuse me?

You need
your own restaurant.

Yeah. That'd be cool.

Yeah, it would.
That's an understatement.

Mm-hmm.
Frank had
his own place.

He's just
in between restaurants
at the moment.

All right. Not for long,
'cause I'm gonna check around.

You know how Vegas is.
These huge casino joints
keep opening and closing.

You really got
to stay on top of it.

I'll just get
your information
from Lola, and...

I'll-I'll look around.

Thanks, Keith.
That'd be great.
Yeah.

I'm gonna head back in, Lola.
So I'll see you in there?

-Cool. I'll see you in there.
-All right, for sure. Uh...

Well, that was
pretty funny.

Yeah, it's
fucking hilarious,

especially
the part where he said
he didn't know I existed.

He never asked me
about my personal life,
so I didn't tell him.

I kind of owned
his ass, huh?

Yep.

So now he'll really
try to fuck you. Ow!

Shit!

Hey, baby.

Yo, frank. It's Keith.

Who?

Winkleman.

<i> Your lovely lady's</i>
<i> sitting right next to me.</i>

<i> You good?</i>

Yeah. Where are you?

I'm with your girl.
We're at the space.
You got a sec?

<i> You ever heard</i>
<i> of Henri ricard?</i>

Of course.

Dude's got
more three-star
michelin restaurants

<i> than anyone</i>
<i> in the world.</i>
Was that a question?

Now, listen. My dad
financed Chloe, right?

Ricard's spot
in Santa Monica.
You ever heard of it?

<i> Yeah. Yeah,</i>
<i> I've been there.</i>

We're all friends,
and now he's opened up
a new spot at the encore.

<i> It's a big fucking deal.</i>
<i> Auditions were in Paris</i>
<i> two weeks ago.</i>

Yeah, cool. I get it.
You're connected.
<i> Well, listen, my man.</i>

He doesn't wanna bring
a celebrity chef to Vegas.
It's been done.

People are over it.
Gordon ramsay, all these people.
Blah, blah, blah.

He wants to launch
a new star right here.

<i> But he doesn't like</i>
<i> any of the chefs</i>
<i> that he auditioned.</i>

Frank, I got you in.

His mansion. In Paris.
This Friday.

Boom. It's gonna be
a mystery basket, so you got to
improvise. I hope that's okay.

Wait a minute.

You-- you what?

Yeah. You're cooking
for Henri fucking ricard
in three fucking days.

<i>I took care of the flights,</i>
<i>the tickets. My commission's</i>
<i>gonna come out of ricard's take.</i>

<i>All you do is show up</i>
<i>and cook the meal of your life.</i>

Are you fucking with me?

He says,
"are you fucking with me?"

No, my man, I'm not.
What do you think?

It's amazing.
I don't know what to say.
<i> Yes.</i>

Hey, listen-- listen, man.
Thank me when it's all done.
I got a good feeling about this.

All right.

<i> You're gonna</i>
<i>kill it out there,</i>
<i>one-handed or not.</i>

Yeah.

I know it.
It's not that.

Then what is it?

Is it me?

I just wish
i could go back in time

and protect you
from that fucking scumbag.

Then we'd be fine.
I know it.

It's me.

I love you.

Don't forget that.

Good luck.

<i> This is Lola.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

Hey, it's me.

I'm going into this thing,
so, uh, I just wanted
to call and say hey.

Anyway, call me.

I love you.

Mr. Riley?
Mm-hmm.

I'm Charles,
Mr. ricard's attaché.

<i> Bonjour.</i>

The house is just
across the Plaza.

Let's walk.
Okay.

<i> All of the ingredients</i>
<i>are in the kitchen.</i>

Anything in the pantry
is yours.

We have one sous chef for you.
He speaks English,
but French is preferable.

Okay.

There'll be
two people eating.

Hello, chef.
I'm Khalil.

<i> Bonjour.</i>
Nice to meet you.

Um, the basket.

All right, all right,
all right.

I got this, man. I got this.

<i> -Merci.</i>
-Okay.<i> Bon courage.</i>

Truffle?
<i> Oui.</i>

Smell it.

Great.

Right?
Yeah.

Okay, chef.

<i> Oui.</i>

You know where you are, right?

<i> Oui.</i>

<i> Bon appétit.</i>

You used truffle, yes?
Yes.

That was not
the agreement.
Yeah, I know.

Okay, I have an appointment.
You can show yourself out.
Thank you for your time.

<i> Bonsoir.</i>

Okay. Come on, playboy.
Try a Martini.

Your aim
is getting better.
I practice.

Yeah, practice your Martini,
American style.
Much more important.

American style?

We like 'em dry in America.

Right.

Whiskey,<i> s'il vous plaît.</i>

How's it going?

New York?

Brooklyn?

It's queens, right?
Queens, yeah?

How can you tell?

Alan.

Keith.

I'm sorry.

So what brings you
to Paris?

I was on vacation
with my girlfriend.

She left. I stayed.
Oh.

Well, you don't seem
too broken up about it.

Hmm. These things happen,
i guess.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

<i> -Très bien.</i>
<i> -Merci, beaucoup.</i>

Alan, right?

Yeah.

You know,
you look so familiar.
I'm trying to place it.

I-i know I've seen
your face before.

No, I doubt that.

I got it.

You're Alan Larsson, right?

Yeah. Have we met?

No, I've seen your picture
on the back of your book.
Your memoir.

I studied it in college
in Northwestern.

Really--
really fucking brainy stuff.

Seriously.

Am I right?

Yeah. Oh, thanks
for your kind words.

You know,
I'd like to buy you a drink
if you don't mind.

Wait, don't be silly.
You're the one
with the heavy heart.

It's not every day
you run into a fan,
so cheers to that.

Cheers.

So, um,
if you're up to it,

I can show you around
in Paris.

You know what?
Why the hell not?

So let's grab one more
and then have some fun.

Sounds good.

Make yourself comfortable.

So you live here alone?

Well, occasionally.

I'm married.

So I have this
for when I need it,

if you catch my drift.

Your wife doesn't mind?
There are rules.

Certain behavior's
permitted.

Certain behavior's not.

Cheers.

With other girls, right?

They have to
remain strangers.

But my wife has
the same privileges.

Just only lovers,
no feelings.

You always play by the rules?

You have a lot of questions,
you know that?

Oh, excuse me.

Mm. No problem.

Hello?

Excuse me.

So, you read my book
at the Northwestern, right?

Mm. Yeah.

Yeah, that makes sense.

I was an adjunct professor there
for a couple of years.

So where'd you live?

Off campus.

Let me guess. Marty summers
taught you my book.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, Marty summers.
He's a great guy.

Yes. Great.

You never went
to Northwestern,
did you, Keith?

Why would you ask that?

What are the chances that
an American knowing my book
so well?

And then just runs
into me here in Paris
at my local bistro.

Marty summers is
my American accountant.

He's not a teacher.

Okay.

What do you want?
What have I done to you?

You don't just rape a girl
and get away with it.

I never raped anyone
in my whole life.

Now, who told you that?

It doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
It matters for me.

You have to give me
a chance to defend myself.

Queens, is that where you live?

Hmm.

So let me guess.

It's las Vegas, right?

I'm starting to know
what this is all about.

Come on.
Hey, hey.

<i> Play with her.</i>

<i> Ask me nicely, Alan.</i>

<i> No. I'm not</i>
<i> gonna ask you nicely.</i>

<i> Play with her. Do it.</i>

<i> Fine.</i>

<i> Keep going.</i>

<i> Now look at me.</i>
<i> Both-- both of you.</i>

<i> I think I know</i>
<i> what you want.</i>

<i> No, you don't.</i>
<i> Yeah, I do.</i>

<i> No, you don't.</i>

Put it back on.
Could you please
put down your knife?

Put it back on.

<i>You want us...</i>
<i>To get rough?</i>

<i>You wanna see it</i>
<i>really fucking rough?</i>

<i>You wanna be a part of it,</i>
<i>but it's just the two of us</i>
<i>and I'd be left out.</i>

<i>No, I'm not getting left out.</i>

<i>Don't lie.</i>

<i> You want us to love it</i>
<i> so much, and we will.</i>

<i>We're gonna fucking love it.</i>

<i> Want me to give it</i>
<i>to you rough?</i>
<i>I want you to give it to me.</i>

<i> Come here.</i>

<i>Come here, come here,</i>
<i>come here.</i>

<i>Come here.</i>

You asked me before
if I ever broke the rules.

I did once, with her.

So it was serious, huh?

I mean, you, uh--

it was real.

Yeah. Quite real.

And I'm dreadfully sorry
that you had to see the tape.

No man should be
exposed to that.

Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I had no idea.

She can be very convincing.

Are you two still together?

Who was the other girl?
We met her at a club.

I was actually planning
dropping by there tonight.

Maybe you want to come along?

Hello.
Come on.

Enjoy.
Yeah.

So I have
an early appointment.

You'll be all right
by yourself?

Yeah, man, I'm fine.

I'm coming to las Vegas
in a while for business.

Here's my card.
I stay at the encore hotel.

Hey, Alan.

What?

Thanks.

So what do you need?

A floor. A bed. Not this.

And that's why you're here?

To find someone and take her
somewhere more private?

I haven't decided yet.

Let me know if you do.

I might be able to help.

The restaurant I am planning
is not small,

and there will be
a lot of visibility.

You are very impressive
in the kitchen,

but are you strong enough
for the pressure,
the responsibility

of what will be
in front of you?

<i> Oui.</i>

Does the ride
that just dropped you off
mean what I think it means?

What?
I was watching
from the balcony.

Yeah. I got it.

Yes!
Mm-hmm.

I knew that you would.

You hungry?

Yeah, sure.

Good. 'Cause
I'm taking you out.

Mm-hmm.

You saw him.

In Paris.

What did he tell you?

Come on. Let's eat later.

Mmm.

Do you have any idea...

<i> What it's like to watch</i>
<i> the woman you love...</i>

Take orders
like a little whore...

<i> Down on her hands</i>
<i> and knees...</i>

Oh, what a beautiful cock.

He showed you the video.

He knew I was going
to hurt him.

Because of what you said,
you know.

He took me
to his favorite club.

Did you go home with anyone?

Some rich lady
and her friend.

So now I'm rotten.

So are you.

So is this.

I'll come back
and get my shit tomorrow.

You said you'd be gone by 6:00.
It's nearly 7:00.

I just want to know
what happened.

The truth.

You know?

Please.

He played you.

You got played.

What?

The woman who picked you up
in the club...

What did she look like?

What difference
does it make?

Did she live in the 7th,
in a mansion?

Yeah.
Yeah, it's Claire.
It's his wife.

Getting her to misbehave
allows him to do
whatever he wants.

He's the one you fucked
in the hotel. Right?

Yeah.

Why?

Pour me a drink.

I went to Paris to study,

and Alan
was the only person
that I knew.

He said that I could have
the place all to myself.

And I remember
my first night there.

I was sitting in the kitchen,

and I was looking out
the window over Paris,
and I thought,

"wow. For the first time,
I'm not surrounded by chaos."

And then I went to bed.

And when I woke up,

he had already tied
my hands and my feet to the bed.

It wasn't the rape--
and he did rape me--

that turned me into this--

this crazy person.

What fucked me up
was that I didn't leave.

I stayed with him.

What fucked me up...

Was that I...
Fell in love with him.

I found out that I was pregnant.

And he just disappeared.

I f-freaked out
and started calling the house.

His wife said to me
that if I...

Got an abortion...

If I left France immediately
she was going to write me
a check for $400,000.

So I came here
a week later...

And that's when I met you.

And that morning,

he called me,
and he was begging me
to let him apologize.

And I had--

I had no intention
of fucking him.

And then i-- I think...

I just-- I think I shut down.

I just let him do it.

And when it was over...

I started to panic...

Because all I could
think about was you...

And what
i just destroyed.

Lola--

I didn't think...

You'd just take me back.

But you did.

Baby, why didn't you
just tell me this before?

Why did you
track him down, frank?

You said that
what we have is rotten.

And you're right.

No.

I'm sorry. I'm so--

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I... I just think that it's--

it's time...

That we let each other go.

No.

You can...
No.

You can leave your keys
on the table.

The new shit
comes Monday, right?

<i> Sí, jefe.</i>

You think you can handle
that delivery by yourself?

Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

Bonjour.
<i> Bonjour,</i> Charles.

<i> How's everything?</i>

Oh, yeah,
we're here now.
No, it's great.

It's perfect.

Well, I wanted to come
to Paris and cook Henri
the complete menu.

<i> Yes, of course.</i>

Yeah.
<i> Très bien.</i>
<i> When?</i>

I was thinking
maybe next week.

<i> Terrific.</i>

<i> Bravo, monsieur.</i>

If I knew we would be
talking about that
troublesome little girl,

I would not have
invited you in.

I understand.
I'm sorry, but...

I need to hear it from you.

Because you don't trust her?

Because I need to know
that I can.

And if I don't want
to discuss it?

That's up to you.

Yes, Alan got her pregnant.

And, yes, I gave her money
to go away.

You can let yourself out.
And, please, don't come back.

He came to see her,
you know.

In Vegas.

When?
December.

December?
He was on business in Chicago.

Oh, yeah?

You sure about that?

Alan can be reckless,
but he's not a fool.

His heart is with me.

I was very clear
about what would happen

if he made
another mistake with her.

Why don't we
pay him a visit
and let him prove it?

Impossible.
He's traveling.

Business trip?

Mm-hmm.

Chicago?

Right?

Uh-huh.

When did he leave?

This morning.

Lola.

How's Vegas treating you?

I should have known
it would be you.

Aren't you supposed
to be in Chicago?

As far as Claire
is concerned, I am.

You have a very trusting wife.

I do indeed.

-Keith--
-my name is frank, not Keith.

This is my restaurant.

Want a drink?

Yeah, why not?

Have a seat.

Or not.

Well, you're
very clever, Alan.

You're always one step
ahead of me.

Oh, no knife this time.
You want to frisk me?

I should not have played
that tape. I'm sorry.

Oh, you loved
showing me that tape.

Come on.

So, uh,
why are you here, man?

I know
you want to fuck her,

but is it really
worth all the...

Transatlantic travel?

I don't think you'd understand.

Why's that?

Because you're a fucking monkey
who lies to himself
about what turns him on.

I'm not like that,
and neither is Lola.

Lola needs to be left alone.

She deserves that,
after what
we've put her through.

Right.

You're going
to go back to Claire.

You're going
to leave Lola alone.

And you're going
to do it today.

And if I don't?

You will.

My wife is someone, a thing,
that I tolerate.

Lola is my prize.

Your flight's in four hours.

I'm sorry. That doesn't work.

Hey. You see all these?

They record sound too.

Claire gave me
her e-mail address.

She could be
watching all of this
in less than an hour.

Right.

You're not
35 years old anymore.

Getting a little long
in the tooth for this shit.
Don't you think?

Something to think about.

Right, yeah.

Just do yourself
a favor, pops.

Get the fuck
out of here.
Yeah.

Fuck!

Ahh! Ah.

Oh, fuck.

Okay.

You got your passport?

Huh?

Your fucking passport.
Do you got it?

Y-yeah.

All right. I'm going
to drive you to the airport,

and you're going
to fucking disappear.

Am I clear?

Y-you're clear.
Okay.

If somebody ate me, all my,
like, rage and my sexual,
you know, energy

will go into that per--
and I got a lot of it.

Is she here yet?
Nope.

Make sure there's
a Martini waiting for her.

Oh! Yo, yo, yo.

I want everyone to stop
for one second

and look up here,
pay your respects

to the man who made
this possible.

Frank Riley, everyone.
Raise a glass.

Frank, you've really
outdone yourself.

Cheers. Thank you, frank.

Mmm.

All right now,
you just gotta do it.

Just toss it in there.

Thanks.

Wow.

Look at you.

This is pretty cool, Frankie.
This is pretty fucking cool.

Yeah, it's all right.

I'm sorry that I'm late.

I'm used to it.

They need you
back there.

Yeah, I gotta--
go. I know.

We can talk later.

Hazel will take care of you.

What should I order?

The first meal I ever made you.
It's on the menu.

So, I got
some other good news.

Okay.

I'm back to being me.

That psycho--
i sent him home.

That's 'cause
I'm not around.

That's not true.

Lola--
why do you want me back?

Because all the reasons
to stay away-- they don't work.

And every day I tell myself,
"yeah, you blew it."

"Get over it."

And every morning
when I wake up,

first thing
i think of is you.

Do you still love me?

I wouldn't be here
if I didn't.

It's your...
Big day.

Now it's your triumph.
It's so well-deserved.

I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go get changed...

And you think about it.

And if you're here
when I come back...

I'll have my answer.

Okay?

Okay.

I'll be back.
