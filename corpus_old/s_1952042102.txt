Hello?

Michael?

Hello?

Shh!

[Sighs] Jerk!
What?

You scared the shit out of me.
Oh, it was a joke.

Whatever. I'm going.
Wait. No, no, no. Come on. Come on.

Don't be like that.

[Sighs] This was supposed to be romantic.
This is not romantic.

This is creepy.
I'm freezing my ass off.

Fine.
Then, uh...

let's just-just forget it.

Forget what?

[Clears Throat]

Happy birthday.
[Gasps]

Oh!
It's not my birthday.

I'm early.
I couldn't wait.

Those are real diamonds,
in case you're wondering.

It's too much.

Oh. Okay. Well, then I'll just take it back.
No! No, no, no.

No! [Laughing]
I love it.


It's so beautiful.
Thank you.

Mmm.

I'm fine.
I'm fine.

I just wanna get out of here, okay?
<i>[Man] Laurel!</i>

[Both Gasp]

<i>Dad.</i>
[Stammers]

Get in the car.

Bye.

Put some clothes on.

What are you doing way up here?

Did you follow me?

I asked you to stay away from him.

Michael and I are getting married.

That's not gonna happen.

I'll be 18 next week.
You can't stop us.

You're gonna be 18.

Why do you hate him so much?

He has nothing to do with it.
I hate myself.

<i>I had so many plans for you.</i>
<i>Everything got spoiled.</i>

Dad, what are you-
It was all my fault.

I'm so sorry for what I did.

Have you been drinking?
Dad-

I didn't know what else to do.
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

<i>Dad, can you slow down, please?</i>
<i>Dad!</i>

[Praying Indistinctly]
<i>Watch the road!</i>

Just let me out of this car!
The darkness is coming for you!

Let me out! No!

No!
Stop it!

<i>[Screaming]</i>
<i>Dad!</i>

<i>[Horn Honking]</i>

[Woman] 911. What's your emergency?

[Stammering]
911. Are you there?

Hello?


<i>[Dog Barking In Distance]</i>


<i>You're up early.</i>
<i>Did you sleep okay?</i>

Yeah.

<i>You feelin' all right?</i>

This uniform makes me nauseous,
if that's what you mean.

I think you look pretty.

You're not wearing your glasses.

Even prettier.

<i>It's a good school, Molly.</i>

It's one of the best in the state.
Promise me that...

<i>you'll give it a chance.</i>

<i>A fresh start, okay?</i>

For both of us?


Okay. Enjoy yourself.

Yeah.

<i>[Door Closes]</i>

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>Well...</i>

you are an excellent student,
Miss Hartley.

<i>I'm sure you'll find Huntington Prep...</i>

<i>every bit as challenging</i>
<i>as your last school.</i>

Your, uh, father...

has requested an appointment
with our school counselor.

<i>Dr. Emerson, Room 260, sixth period.</i>
<i>[Knocking]</i>

<i>Ah, Miss White.</i>
<i>Miss White, Miss Hartley.</i>

<i>Miss White will escort you</i>

<i>[Door Opens]</i>

Mr. Draper, this is Molly Hartley.
It's her first day.

She's from Boston,
and she had a 4.0 at Filmore Prep.

<i>[Wolf Whistle]</i>

<i>[Mr. Draper] Welcome,
Miss Hartley from Boston.</i>

Thank you.

Any other pertinent
information we should know about?

Hobbies?
Food allergies, maybe?

<i>[Students Chuckling]</i>
<i>I'm kidding. All right. Take a seat then.</i>

<i>We're in the middle</i>
<i>of</i> Paradise Lost.

We can share.

[Mock Cough]
Jealous.

Excuse me?

<i>[Mr. Draper] Ladies, are we done?</i>
Yes, I'm done.

Can we continue?

<i>Mr. Young, keep reading.</i>
<i>"Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell."</i>

Do you want pizza?
Or maybe a sandwich?

It's my treat.


Don't worry.
They're not laughing at you.

People make fun of me
because I'm on scholarship...

not that it's any of their business.

And some people are offended
because I have a close...

personal relationship with Jesus.

<i>[High-pitched Frequency]</i>
Doesn't bother me.

Are you okay?

Molly?
<i>[Voices Whispering]</i>

I'll be right back.

Do you want me to come with you?
<i>No.</i>


You can't hide in here
all day, you know.

Believe me.

I've tried.

Are you okay?

I'm Joseph Young, from English class?

Yeah. I remember.
Yeah.

Usually I'm pretty good at this.
At what?

Flirting, I guess.
[Chuckles]

No one normally gets hurt though.

I am fine.
No permanent damage.

Good.

Ditching class on the first day, I see.
That's pretty bold.

I don't have a sixth period.
Everyone has sixth period.

Okay, I get it.
Woman of mystery.

So what are you doing right now?
You wanna go grab something to eat or what?

What about that girl from class?

Who, Suzie?
She's your girlfriend, right?

Well, hey, we can be friends.
Everyone needs friends, right?

I'm new. I don't need
that kind of trouble.

Okay.

<i>I have to get home.</i>

Uh, wait.
I can give you a ride if you want.

No, thanks.

I'll see you in school tomorrow then.

So?
So?

How was the first day of school?

How was the first day of work?

Ah, it was busy.
Lots of meetings.

Bad coffee.

Same here.

Did you see the school counselor?

Yeah.
He was fine.

School's fine.
Everything was fine.

Well, I was hopin'
things would be better than fine.

You know, maybe good...
or promising.

Stop acting like
everything is all right.

It's never going to be all right.

<i>What is wrong with you?</i>
Nothing is wrong with me.

<i>I am doing my best</i>
<i>to keep this family together...</i>

and I expect you to do the same.

Can she get out?

<i>Hmm?</i>

Can she get out of that place?

She's sick. But there's a chance that
she could get well. And if that happens-

<i>I wanna know that she can't get out.</i>
<i>I wanna know that she's locked up forever.</i>

<i>She can't hurt you, Molly, I promise.</i>

No one is ever gonna hurt you again.
I won't let that happen.

<i>All right?</i>

<i>If you ever change your mind,</i>
<i>if you ever feel like seeing her...</i>

you know,
that would be okay too.

No.

She's still your mother.

I'm not hungry.

Do you-
You want me to make you something else?

I need to start my homework.

<i>[Woman Whispering, Indistinct]</i>

Mom?
Molly.

Honey, come pray with me.
Pray.

Pray, Molly!

I renounce his works and give my life to you.
Please fill me with your Holy Spirit.

Pray, Molly.
Pray!

Forgive me.
I have... sinned?

You know I love you.

I'm sorry,
but I know what you are now.

And it's the only way.
You understand, don't you?

No.

Close your eyes, Molly. I can save you.

<i>## [Continues, Fades]</i>
Hi.

All right, take a seat.

<i>Well, after reading your papers</i>
<i>on</i> Paradise Lost <i>over the weekend...</i>

I've decided to revise
the lesson plans a bit.

Pass these back.

<i>[Boy] Check it out.</i>
The Bible?

This isn't to be read
in a religious context.

But it occurs to me many of you
don't have the necessary reference points...

to fully appreciate these iconic texts
of English literature.

So, Leah, we're all gonna do
a little extra reading.

Look, my parents don't pay a shitload
of tuition for me to get stuck in Bible camp.

Your parents pay for an excellent education,
which is exactly what I'm giving you.

Hmm.
Thanks, but no thanks.

Yes, Alexis?

I already have a Bible. I don't need this one.
<i>Well, just to keep things clear...</i>

we're all gonna use the same edition
just like all of our other texts.

I'm not comfortable with that.

I'm sorry?

I don't feel comfortable talking
about the Bible as some sort of text.

It's the word of God, not some morally
questionable novel you give us a pop quiz on.

Jesus freak.
That's enough.

It's sacrilegious.
It's profane.

<i>[Voices Whispering]</i>
<i>Alexis, I appreciate your beliefs. I do.</i>

<i>You need to learn to navigate in the</i>
<i>secular world if you wanna succeed here.</i>

I can navigate in the secular world
without questioning my beliefs.

<i>I don't see why we have to talk about this</i>
<i>as if it's an opinion. It's the truth.</i>

I-
[Breathing Erratically]

<i>Molly, do you have something to add?</i>

You're bleeding.

<i>[Mr. Draper]</i>
<i>Here.</i>

<i>You may be excused.</i>

All right,
open to the Book of Psalms.

<i>And Leah's gonna lead us through it.</i>
<i>[Leah] Is this extra credit?</i>

<i>[Voice Whispering]</i>
<i>Molly?</i>

Hello?

<i>Molly?</i>

<i>[Voices Whispering]</i>

<i>Molly? [Echoing]</i>
Hello?

<i>Molly?</i>

<i>[Molly] Who's there?</i>
<i>Molly?</i>

Hello?

<i>Molly? Molly? Molly, where are you?</i>
[Panting]

<i>Molly?</i>

<i>[Voice Continues, Indistinct]</i>
[Hyperventilating]

<i>Molly?</i>

Molly? Are you okay?

<i>[Hyperventilating]</i>
I- I brought you a clean shirt.

Molly, what's happening?
I can't- I can't-

<i>[Gasping]</i>
Somebody, help!

Are you feeling better?
I was off campus at a meeting.

I'm Dr. Emerson.

I guess you got sidetracked on your way
to our appointment yesterday.

I understand.

I imagine it must be overwhelming
on your first day of classes...

but your father insisted.

He worries a lot.
I hope you don't mind.

It's still technically sealed.

But everything stays between
you and me, all right?

I don't need to be here.

Heard you had a panic attack in class today.
You wanna tell me about it?

It was just a nosebleed.

Just got freaked out
by all the blood, that's all.

Must be hard being new at school
even under the best of circumstances.

<i>I'm new here too.</i>
<i>It's hard for me.</i>

How are you feeling otherwise?

Whatever it says in there,
I'm not like her.

<i>We're not suggesting that, Molly.</i>
<i>Our only concern is you.</i>

Well, I told you, I'm fine.

Your mother stabbed you
in the chest...

with a pair of scissors.

There was no sign of mental illness...

<i>no warning.</i>

I don't remember, okay?

<i>Everyone keeps asking me what happened,</i>
<i>and I don't remember.</i>

She's locked up, and she can't get out.
<i>Are you interested in knowing...</i>

what her diagnosis is?

<i>"Probable psychotic disorder.</i>

"Signs of paranoid schizophrenia...

or a schizo-affective disorder
accompanied by a bipolar disorder."

I get it.
She's crazy.

It's okay to be scared, Molly.

What?

Of developing the same symptoms.

<i>There is a genetic component</i>
<i>to this disease.</i>

We're gonna keep an eye on you.

We're not gonna let anything
happen to you.

[Exhales Sharply]

[No Audible Dialogue]
<i>[Shuffling Sound]</i>

Books?
[Gasps]

<i>You're lookin' up shit in books?</i>
<i>Isn't that what computers are for?</i>

Uh, compu-
Schools, um, track...

everything you look up
on the computer.

You know, standard procedure.

Well, I guess I didn't peg you
as the paranoid type.

I'm not.

I just don't like people
keeping a record of my thoughts.

Oh.

<i>"Medical Diagnostic Manual</i>
<i>of Mental Disorders"?</i>

What?
You don't need this.

I can diagnose you.

Yeah. Ooh.

This is not good.
It's, um...

Ebola.

[Both Chuckling]

Good call.
Yeah, well, it was, uh...

kind of the nosebleed
that gave you away.

Yeah.

Too bad you only have six hours to live.
Too bad.

Well, maybe now,
you'll let me give you a ride home...

since we don't have
that much time left.

<i>[School Bell Ringing]</i>

Since it's terminal,
I guess I can make an exception.

Well, good.
Let's go.

<i>So are you good friends</i>
<i>with that Alexis girl?</i>

No. Why?

I don't know.
Just wondering.

She's nice to me, that's all.

Nice?
I can be nice.

Hey.

What the hell happened?
Nothing.

You had a nosebleed.
You started hyperventilating.

You had a panic attack.
That's nothing?

I'll just see you tomorrow, Molly.
It's fine.

Molly, how do you think
that makes me feel-

to know that my daughter is hurt
and bleeding and won't even call me?


I'm sorry. I-I overreacted.

I'm worried about you, that's all.

You never used to worry.

You never paid attention to me at all.

Stop trying to control my life.

I'm not trying
to control your life.

You went to see her?

She's my wife.

You need to tell me when you're not
feeling well. I need to know.

What?
You need to know if I'm crazy too?

Sweetie, you are not crazy.

My head hurts. I hear things.
Everything's mixed up.

I just-

It was all my fault.


Look, tomorrow I'll make
an appointment with a doctor, okay?

We'll get you checked out.
I know that everything is gonna be fine.

We're gonna get through this.
Okay?

<i>[Water Running]</i>

<i>[High-pitched Frequency]</i>
<i>[Voice Whispering] Molly?</i>

Oh, shit.

<i>Molly?</i>

<i>Molly?</i>


<i>I know what you are, Molly.</i>

[Snarling]
[Screaming]

Wait! Daddy!

Daddy, help!
Let me out!

Molly, what's going on?

Daddy, let me out! Dad!

Molly! Molly!

Daddy! Daddy!

<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Molly? Molly, do you know where you are?</i>

Molly, are you with me?
[Gasps]

Easy. Easy.
Just relax.

<i>[Monitor Beeping]</i>
[Exhales Sharply]

How did-
What's going on?

You're in the hospital.
Everything's all right, baby.

You're gonna be fine.
How long have you been having nosebleeds?

A while, since before Mom-

Have you been experiencing vision problems?
Headaches? Dizziness?

See this little spot?
It's most likely a tumor...

<i>in your sinus cavity.</i>

<i>A nasal hemangioma.</i>
<i>A little mass of blood vessels...</i>

<i>growing out of control and creating</i>
<i>a whole lot of pressure in your head.</i>

That would explain the nosebleeds,
the headaches and the vision problems.

What about... hearing things?

<i>Can that happen too?</i>

Sometimes the buildup of pressure
can cause episodes of vertigo...

or auditory hallucinations, disorientation.

I thought I was going crazy.

We caught it early,
so there's nothing to worry about.

These things are pesky,
but usually benign.

<i>We'll do an endoscopic procedure...</i>

<i>and monitor you for a few days.</i>

<i>You don't mind missing</i>
<i>a little school, do you?</i>

Good. I'll schedule the surgery
for tomorrow morning.

Get some rest.

You see?
Everything's gonna be all right now.

Everything's gonna be absolutely fine.

Is my dad here?

Is there any water?

I know what you are.

[Gasping]
It's okay. It's okay. You're okay.

You're out of surgery now, sweetie.
Everything went really well.

There was no complications.
The tumor's benign.

She was here.

Who?
Mom.

No, it's just you and me.

I saw her.
She tried-

No, it's just the anaesthesia.

Just go and relax.
Lie back down.

I don't suppose you feel like
having a visitor?

A visitor?
Yeah, a friend from school came to see you.

<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

You want me to tell her to come back
when you're feeling better?

No. It's okay.

Okay. Come in.

I'm gonna go scrounge up a decent meal.
You girls want anything?

A pizza, or chili cheese fries?

No, thanks, Mr. Hartley.

Okay. Okay.
I'll be right back.

Your dad seems really nice.
Yeah.

My grandmother works in a hospital.

She says flowers
make all the difference.

How did you know I was here?

Everyone at Huntington knows everything.
No secrets.

You're big news. But don't worry about it.
What do you mean?

I brought some homework assignments.

Thought I could help you catch up.

Why are you so nice to me?

Molly, can I ask you a question?

<i>Sure.</i>

Have you been saved?

The doctor caught the tumor early.
I'm fine.

That's not what I mean.

Oh. Right.

Have you been baptized?

My parents don't believe in that sort of thing.
Well, what about you?

This is your life, your journey.

What do you believe?

I'm just worried about you, that's all.

I'm feeling a little tired.

I brought this for you.


Thanks.

Sure.

I pray for you every night.

<i>[Mr. Hartley]</i>
<i>How do you feel?</i>

Good.
Your birthday's coming up. What about a party?

A party?

Cake, presents, a clown.

No clown.

You know, time rushes by
like you wouldn't believe, Molly.

I mean, just yesterday
you were a little thing in pigtails.

And suddenly, you're 18.
All grown up.

You won't need me anymore.

Don't worry.
I'll need you.

Okay.

Um, I'll see you in a few minutes.
All right.

Hey.

Welcome back.
Thanks. Nice catch.

I didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

I would've definitely milked that " brain
surgery" thing for, like, a month off, maybe two.

It wasn't actually brain surgery.

You're better now, right? Aren't you?
I'm fine.

Great. Then you can come
to my party tonight.

Tonight?
It's a Tuesday.

Exactly. It's a Tuesday,
and my parents are out of town.

I don't know.
Maybe.

Well, you'll need the secret code.

A secret code?

Just for the gate.

Can't be too careful.

Oh, and bring anyone you want
as long as it's not a guy.

<i>Yo, yo, let's go!</i>

Wait! Where do you live?

Molly.
Are you feeling better?

Yeah. Thanks.
Aw.

I hope it wasn't too serious.

No.
[Chuckling]

So what were you and Joseph
talking about?

Nothing. We're just friends.
Of course.

It must be really difficult
to... be in your situation.

What's that supposed to mean?

He doesn't really want you to come.

Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I didn't even see you there.

You're a bitch.

I know.

God, I hate her.

[Both Chuckling]
Do you wanna eat?

<i>[Leah]</i>
<i>So, are you gonna go?</i>

To the party?
Yeah, to the party.

I don't know if I wanna go.

Yeah, you do. You wanna go,
and you wanna take me with you.

You wanna go to the party?

Please.
It's not like I even care.

It's just-
You know, it's something to do.

Come on. You can't tell me
you're not bored out of your mind here.

You can count, right?

So then what's your curfew for tonight?
Curfew?

Molly!

Over here.
I don't, um-

I don't really do the cafeteria thing.
So... call me later.

Ditch the Bible thumper.

[Engine Starts]
Do you know where he lives?

Come on. Everybody knows
where Joseph Young lives.

His father owns, like, half the city.
You didn't know that?

No.

Well, Suzie's not gonna let you
have him without a fight, so-

Who says I want him?

Yeah. Okay.
That was convincing. Good job.

I saw you in Emerson's office
the other day.

Oh, really?

So what, does that mean
we're sharing now?

Should we read each other's journals
and promise to be best friends forever?

I have- I have anger issues.

My father died
of throat cancer last year.

<i>Then when he's dead I find out</i>
<i>he's not even really my father.</i>

Turns out I'm adopted.

My real parents, they gave me up.

<i>They just didn't</i>
<i>feel like keeping me.</i>

So what about you?
You got low self-esteem?

Or, uh, mild depression?

<i>Or maybe a weird</i>
<i>psychosexual disorder?</i>

My mom tried to kill me.

She stabbed me in the bathroom
one day after school.

Right.

<i>Fight back, girl!</i>

Go to hell.

Stay away from my boyfriend!

[Grunting]
I don't like to be threatened!


You bitch!

Leave... me... alone!
[Wrist Snaps]

[Screaming Continues]

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Messed her up!</i>

<i>There's no way.</i>
<i>[Laughing]</i>

<i>So he gets sent for, like,</i>
<i>three weeks and he cries-</i>

I wanna go home.
What?

I want to go home.

Okay. Okay. Well,
I'm not ready to go yet.

If it weren't for me, you wouldn't
even be here. I got you invited.

Sorry. I think I'm too wasted
to drive you home.

Ask your new boyfriend.

Molly! Molly, wait.

I didn't mean it.
I-

[Beeps]
<i>Shit!</i>


[Line Ringing]

Hey.
Dad?

Where the hell are you? I've been trying
to call you. You have to leave your phone on.

I'm sorry.
I need you to come pick me up.

[Signal Cutting Out] Not sure- am-
Molly?

Dad? Dad?

Are you there?

Molly!
[Beeping]

<i>[Voices Whispering]</i>

[Barking]
[Screaming]

<i>[Men Chattering]</i>

[Coin Dropping In Slot]
[Beeping]


Molly?

I'm at a pay phone.
It's 145 F-Fairpoint Drive.

It's, um, right across from
an old barbecue restaurant.

Are you safe?

Yeah.
Yeah, I'm safe.

Okay. Go inside the restaurant
and wait for me right there.

I'm leaving right now.
You understand?

Okay.
<i>[Receiver Hangs Up]</i>


I know what you are, and I can't let you be
filled with the darkness! Do you understand?

Molly! Molly!

Molly!
Let me save you!

Mom?

Where are you?
Where are you?

Where are you?

Where is she?
Hey, are you all right?

Where is she?
Where is she? Where is she?

<i>[Radio: Dispatcher] Go ahead</i>
<i>and make that an attempted code one.</i>

<i>[Door Opens]</i>
<i>[Bell Jingles]</i>

Molly.

She was here.
No.

Yes.

I know what I saw!
Sweetheart, I called Clayton. She's in her room.

She's been in her room all night.

I'm scared.

Don't be scared.
I'm right here.

That's not good enough.

Everything is gonna be all right.

<i>Suzie.</i>

I'm really sorry.

I know what you are.

What?

<i>What am I?</i>

What am I?

Molly, hey, are you okay?

I've been so worried about you. I left
you messages. Why didn't you call me back?

I don't know.

What happened that night
at the party?

I didn't mean to hurt her.

Molly, I don't care about what happened to
Suzie. I care about what happened to you.

I don't know what happened!

I-
You can tell me. Just talk to me. It's okay.

Please.

Just leave me alone.

Everyone should just leave me alone.
Molly!

<i>[Molly]</i>
<i>It felt real.</i>

But you understand that it wasn't.

What is happening to me?

Fear is a very powerful emotion, Molly.
Plays tricks with your mind.

It makes you see things and hear things
that aren't really there.

Nothing is wrong with you.
You're perfectly normal.

Nothing about me is normal!

Why did she try to kill me?
Your mother is very ill.

She's not in her right mind. She's not
thinking clearly. Do you understand that?

We're gonna
work through this together.

Okay.

Here.
I want you to take this.

I want you to call that number
any time you need to talk.

I'm here for you.

Okay.

Molly.

Look, I'm really sorry, okay?

I should've taken you home
the other night.

It doesn't matter.

But it's your birthday tomorrow.

I mean, let's-
let's do something.

Molly!

<i>Hi.</i>

I need to get home.
I'm sorry.

I know about the party.

I know what happened.
Suzie Woods told me everything.

<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

I'm not mad you ditched me.
Honest.

You should come inside.

I can't.

Whatever you're going through,
we can help.

If you're lost,
if you're afraid, we can help.

If you accept Christ into your heart,
you'll be blessed with eternal salvation...

<i>spiritual protection, grace.</i>

Isn't that what you want?

You're a good person, Molly.
Let me help.

[Lock Clicks]

[Beeping, Line Ringing]

Hi, you've reached
Robert Hartley's cell phone.

I'm unavailable to take your call right now,
but if you leave me a message...

I'll call you as soon as I can.
[Beeps]

I'm home. You told me to call
when I got here, so I'm calling.


<i>[Loud Thud]</i>
[Gasps]


<i>[Banging]</i>

<i>[Banging Continues]</i>

<i>[Banging, Rattling]</i>

<i>[Banging, Rattling Continues]</i>


Stupid lock.

Get away from me!

Molly, the nurse let me out.

She let me out because she believes.

What do you want from me?

To save you.
That's all I want.

You have no idea
what you're about to become.

<i>Can't you feel it, Molly?</i>

<i>There is evil everywhere.</i>

The darkness is coming for you, honey.
It's coming.

What's happening to me?

I'm so sorry.
We made a terrible mistake.

What?

You were never meant to live.
We were so weak. We were so selfish.

You died the night you were born...

on the bathroom floor
of a restaurant.

<i>You came too early. I never made it</i>
<i>to the hospital. There was too much blood.</i>

I'd lost babies before- miscarriages-
and I couldn't lose another one.

<i>But then this woman</i>
<i>suddenly appeared.</i>

I don't know where she came from,
but suddenly she was just standing there...

and she offered us a deal.

She promised to make you live.

<i>Honey, they knew you were special.</i>
<i>That's why she came for you.</i>

<i>[Baby Crying]</i>
<i>She promised us 18 years together.</i>

And then you would belong to them.

I don't believe you.
There are others like you.

Dad would've said something!
No, he refuses to believe the truth!

He made the choice, but he doesn't
understand! But I know what we did!

I know this has happened before.

You're crazy!
No, I'm not crazy!

Yeah!
If I don't stop you now, you'll do terrible things.

I just wanna make things right
before it's too late, before you turn 18.

Don't you understand what's happening to you?
Can't you feel it?

You're being torn from this world.

Everything you do will be
in the service of them!

Your life will no longer be yours anymore!
Shut up!

Don't you understand? I can save you!
No!

May God take you
so you can be saved!

Molly!
Help! Somebody help me!

[Groaning]
<i>Molly!</i>

No! I can't let you live!

I can't let the darkness take you!

They're coming for you!

No! I love you!
Honey! No!

No!


[Gasps, Whimpers]




[Panting Continues]
She came back.

She told me everything!

What happened
the night I was born!

What'll happen to me
on my 18th birthday!

Molly, for God's sake, we didn't do anything!
She's delusional!

She knew something was going to happen
to me and she tried to help me!

She wanted to stop it!

No!
Nothing is gonna happen to you!

That wasn't real! That was some religious
nutcase screwing with your mother's head!

You have to do something!
Tomorrow's my fucking birthday!

You can't let them take me!
No one is gonna take you!

<i>Now, this is exactly</i>
<i>how it started with your mother...</i>

<i>with the religious delusions and the</i>
<i>paranoia and the losing touch with reality.</i>

<i>She's dead because of me!</i>

I won't let that happen again.
I won't lose you, too.

Let go!

I'm gonna get you some help.
A good doctor.

<i>Someone who can help you see the truth.</i>
I know the truth!

I have to find a way to stop it!
Then just let me help you.

Let me take you someplace quiet and safe.
I won't let you lock me up!


<i>[People Singing]</i>

<i>## [Continues]</i>
What are you doing here?

I need your help.
I don't know where else to go.

Of course I'll help.
But you have to tell me what's wrong.

Is it too late for me?

Is it too late for me to be saved?

It's never too late.

Even if someone chose
a terrible path for me?

You're responsible
for your own salvation.

God lets you make that choice for yourself.
You're sure?

Of course.

I choose it then.

I choose salvation.

I'm really glad you came to me, Molly.

You won't regret this journey.
I promise.

No!
I can't take a journey!

I need you to help me now.
I'm running out of time.

Time for what?

I need protection...

before it's too late.

Please help me.

Come with me.

This way.

Put this on.

This will work, right?

If you accept Jesus Christ into your heart,
you will be purified.

You'll be born of water and the Spirit,
and you will be saved.

That's what you want, isn't it?

Yes.

Come with me.

Do you believe and trust in God, the
Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth...

who gave us his only son
to die for us?

Do you believe in his son, Jesus Christ,
who was crucified for our sins...

rose from the dead,
and is the only way to salvation?

Do you believe and trust
in the Holy Spirit...

who enables us to receive God's word,
repent, and believe the Gospels?

Say if you believe.

I-

Yes.

Do you wish to be baptized
to seal this faith?

Yes.

Close your eyes.

Is it done?

<i>What's wrong?</i>

Do you know
where my grandmother's a nurse?

Clayton.

I know about your mother, Molly,
and what she believes.

Jesus, forgive me for my sins.
[Gasping]

This will save your soul!

You promised to help me!
I am! I'm saving you! Now you'll be with God!

Stay down!
I'm sending you to heaven!

I know what you are!

I can't let you live!
Don't you see? This is the only way!


<i>[Coughing]</i>


<i>Oh.</i>

I'm sorry.


[Gasping, Sobbing]

Molly? My God!
Are you okay?

What happened?
Come here.

[Sobbing Continues]
Get in the car. It's gonna be okay.

Are you gonna
tell me what happened?

There are a lot of things
that you don't know about me.

Terrible things.

Well, I could probably say
the exact same thing, Molly.

No!

You don't understand!

Okay, so explain it to me.
Please, Molly. Just tell me what happened.

[Panting, Groaning]

Hey, Mr. Hartley.
Is, um- Is Molly here?

No. No.

I just-

I got her a birthday present, so-
Yeah, I'll take it.

Okay.

Is Molly okay?

Yeah.
I'm sure she's fine.

Um... do you have any idea
where she might be?

<i>[Engine Off]</i>

Say something.

I just think you're tired.
Just go inside and get some sleep.

I knew you wouldn't believe me.

Well, what am I supposed to say, Molly?

Do you really expect me to believe
that your soul belongs to the devil?

I mean, don't you realize
how insane that sounds?

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say it like that.

No. You're right.

Maybe I am just like my mother.

Maybe- Maybe I am just I-
losing my mind.

No!
There's nothing wrong with you.

I don't know what to do.

We just need to get the hell outta here, away
from your dad, away from this whole damn town.

And go where?

My dad keeps a lot of money in the safe,
enough to go practically anywhere.

Just you and me.

You don't have to do this.

I'll be right back.
Okay?


[Line Ringing]

This is Amelia Emerson.

Please leave me a detailed message and I'll
return the call as soon as possible. Thank you.

Dr. Emerson, it's Molly.

Something's happened and I'm in trouble,
and I don't know what to do.

I'm at Joseph Young's...

and I'm really scared.

If you could call me back-

<i>Molly!</i>
<i>[Glass Shatters]</i>


Joseph?

Joseph?

Joseph?

Joseph?

Joseph?

What are you doing?

Are you surprised?

<i>It's your birthday, right?</i>

Tomorrow.

Well, it's almost tomorrow.

So, happy birthday a few minutes early.

Come on.
Don't you wanna blow out the candle?


I wanna get out of here.

But what about our party?

Okay, you're scaring me.
What the hell is wrong with you?

<i>Joseph, let's go.</i>

Let's go!

Fine.

<i>Dr. Emerson,</i>
<i>you got my message.</i>

Message?
I called you. I-I left you a message.

No. No message.

Then what are you doing here?

Well, it's your birthday, Molly.
Of course I'm here.

<i>Just a few more minutes now. How does it feel?</i>
<i>[Voices Whispering]</i>

How does what feel?

Your new life.

<i>We're all here for you, Molly.</i>
<i>We've watched you grow.</i>

<i>We've chosen</i> you.
No.

No?

You knew all along?

You lied to me?

You promised to help me!

<i>He</i> is <i>helping you.</i>
<i>We're all helping you.</i>

You're the one, Molly.

Don't you know how lucky you are?

Lucky?
<i>You'll have power like no one before you.</i>

I didn't choose this!

Your mother and father
made that choice for you.

They did it to save my life.
That is not a choice.

Of course it is.

But human weakness has its consequences.
It always has.

<i>[Footsteps]</i>
[Gasps] D-D-Daddy!

I'm so sorry, Molly!

<i>[Groaning]</i>
<i>I didn't- I didn't-</i>

I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

I'm here to make you an offer.

<i>[Baby Crying]</i>

I didn't believe.

We gave you exactly what you wanted.

Then take me!
It was my mistake! Take me!

God, forgive me.
I- I have sinned.

<i>I renounce Satan and all-</i>
What can God offer you?

We've given you everything-
your very life.

And now you have great power
ahead of you.

I don't want it!
You will.

God always gives us a choice.

Is that what you think?
God gives you a choice?

Your parents determined your fate.
They turned their back on God.

They made a pact.

Maybe if you kill your father...

the pact will be dissolved.

What?

<i>Of course I can't offer you that choice,</i>
<i>but... maybe God can.</i>

No. No!

Go ahead. Do it.
Just do it.

Go on.

Sweetie, I love you.

It's- It's the only way.
Just do it.

<i>Please do it.</i>

I'm sorry.


[Striking 12:00]
<i>[Mr. Hartley] I love you.</i>

I've always loved you.

[Screams]
No! No!

No, no, no, no!
[Gasps]



You've always belonged to us.

Welcome.

<i>We've been waiting.</i>

<i>The patient confessed to the murder</i>
<i>and was brought in about a week ago.</i>

<i>There were several</i>
<i>attempted suicides...</i>

<i>as well as paranoid</i>
<i>and religious delusions.</i>

I know this is a lot to take in.

We've had him
under observation for a week.

<i>So far there's been no change.</i>

Some interaction with you
might draw him out of his shell.

No.

I'm sorry?

I can't.
I need to move on.

Don't give up on him.
He's your father.

Not anymore.

Miss Hartley, is there
something you wanna tell me?

It's just the way
things were meant to be.

I know you'll take
really good care of him.

<i>On a personal note...</i>

<i>I would like to thank Huntington Prep</i>
<i>for not only welcoming me into their school...</i>

but for endowing me with
the honor of valedictorian.

<i>In closing, I truly believe that</i>
<i>each one of us has a special destiny...</i>

<i>and we owe it to the world</i>
<i>to fulfill that destiny.</i>

We are the generation who will change
the world like no one has changed it before us.

You can count on it.

Good luck, everyone!

<i>[Cheering, Applause]</i>
