Why me?

Why do I have to die now?

I'm honoured to personally thank our very own "Insect Man"...

Who was good enough to take... - Can you see him?

..A couple of days out from his hectic shooting schedule

and fly back here for the opening.

Mesdames et messieurs, ladies and gentlemen,

Mr. Alan Osborn.

I'll keep this very brief.

When I was a kid, I dreamed of this,

and everybody either laughed at me

or screamed bloody murder.

It's taken a long, long time

and a lot of sacrifice to make it happen.

Now it's... now it's done,

and um... and I have to get back to work

as you have to get back to yours.

And so thank you very much.

Merci d'etre venus si nombreux!

Are you ready?

Let's go!

Blue morpho! Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

Sorry.

Mr. Osborn?

Did you get my messages?

What are you talking about?

I'm Pete Carlton.

And I want to go to the rainforest with you

to find the Blue Morpho butterfly.

You said it's the most beautiful creature you've ever seen.

And you can get answers to the mysteries of the world,

just by looking at it.

Here. This is my resume.

I need to get there right away.

I appreciate your, um, your enthusiasm,

my little entomologist friend, but...

...the season is almost over.

The book says the morpho season goes on for another week.

Yeah, but... - I'm his mom.

Could we talk just for a second?

Yeah. I have to be at another interview in five minutes.

Okay. Uh, you wait for me here,

darling, okay? I'll be back.

His doctors have given him three to six months to live.

Not that I buy that, but...

... his dream is to catch a blue butterfly,

and it's not just a whim.

Brain cancer?

We've been waiting to see if the chemotherapy helped,

but they just found out recently

that there's nothing else they can do.

Look. I mean, I appreciate the problem.

I do, but...

...just like I said, the season is over.

Yeah.

In case no one's noticed, he's in a wheelchair.

Yes. The tumour throws him off balance.

Sorry. Mr. Osborn, we're a bit pushed for time.

If we're going to make the interview,

we should leave right now.

Regarde, cheri.

Mr. Osborn?

If you had a child of your own, and you held him in your arms,

I know you'd know exactly why I'm here,

and what this means to me.

You'd just love him.

He thinks you're the greatest.

I'm sorry. I can't help you.

Excuse us.

Did you say I couldn't walk?

Because I could walk a little if I had to.

Look. You sleep tight,

and we'll figure out something in the morning. Okay?

You know I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.

Don't you?

Don't ever think that.

Sometimes, there are things I just can't tell mom.

I mean, she's never lied to me,

but it doesn't mean she's always told me the truth.

Maybe we're just not afraid of the same things.

All she ever thinks about is me being sick,

me dying.

She never says it, but I know she does.

You have fourteen new messages.

Hi, Mr. Osborn.

I'm a kid named Pete Carlton.

I love your show.

I was wondering if you could give me a call.

I've got a great idea,

and I know we think exactly the same.

Soon as you can. Thanks.

Hi, me again. Pete Carlton.

You know when I first knew I had to catch that morpho?

Two years ago. I was in the hospital,

and I had chemotherapy,

and all these tubes were jabbed into me.

My mom brought me a video of your show,

and I saw that Blue Morpho flying.

It was unbelievable.

I had a dream that night in the hospital

that I caught the morpho and I held it,

and then I got these blue wings.

I was this boy with blue wings.

Man, I could just fly away like crazy.

And then you said how it's magic.

Ever since, I just dream about catching that morpho,

because I have a lot of questions I want to ask it.

Great to meet you today.

I know you're busy,

but I want to tell you I'm leaving.

I'm off to the rainforest now.

I'm running out of time.

I know you're the only one who'd understand.

Could you explain it to my mom, please?

Thanks a lot for two years of your show.

It's the best show in the world.

Yes. Yes. I'm coming.

Mr. Osborn?!

I'm sorry to come by so late.

I tried to phone but the lines were busy.

Oh, it's okay. Please, come in.

Is your son here?

Of course. Hang on. I'll just get him.

No, no, I just um...

Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled.

He reads until midnight anyway.

I just.. - Pete! Just a second.

I got a message... - Hey! Pete.

Hey, Pete!

Pete?

What?

I don't know how he did it.

He's gone to the airport.

This is why I was calling.

Hi, I'm um... I'm... just hang on.

Hang on a second, please?

Teresa Beauchamps Carlton?

Oui?

It's me. Pete!!

We picked him up at the airport.

382 dollars in his pocket,

and the worst fake passport in history.

When that didn't pan out, he tried bribery.

It worked on the cab driver.

What the hell were you thinking?

Don't make me say it.

What are you talking about?

Did you tell Mr. Osborn to say no?

Did I what?

Best guy in the world.

I can't believe he'd say no.

I mean, the guy can do anything.

Mr. Osborn?

Look! I'll take you.

I'll give you a few days in the rainforest.

That's all I can do. If we don't find it,

it's too late. That's it.

That's all we need.

We'll find it. It'll answer everything.

I'm not good with kids.

So don't ask too many questions, okay?

I won't.

Didn't you say just to hold it

is to understand a little bit more about the world?

Ìý×Å  Ëü½ö½öÊÇÖ»ºûµû
Look, it's a butterfly.

I was being poetic, you know, I mean for the TV.

Didn't you say seeing the morpho changed your life?

Will you stop asking questions?

If you don't think that, why are you taking me?

Why do you think I'm taking you? Look at you.

He wants to catch a butterfly.

That's why... - Pete!

Oh! Christ! - Sorry.

Stumped?

Aren't you ever gonna get some sleep?

Who's Maria?

You like her?

You like her.

I don't know her very well.

What do you mean you don't know her well?

I've never even seen her walk.

Paraplegic?

What?

You said she couldn't walk.

Why don't we just think about the..

..The butterfly, the Mariposa Azul.

I'm trying,

but how can you say it's... it's magic,

and it has all these answers?

And now you're saying you lied?

Look.

It is magic.

I mean it did point

my life in a new direction when I first saw it,

but you can't go around telling people

that or they think you're crazy, you know?

Okay?

Now get some sleep...

... before we land.

Hola!

Look at the monkeys, mom!

Spider monkeys.

These past few days,

I've been afraid something would happen

at the last minute and stop us from coming,

I can't believe I'm in the jungle with Mom

who is terrified of snakes and creepy crawlies

and with Mr. Osborn

who loves insects more than anything in the world.

Yana!

Hola, Guillermo.

Look at these kids.

We weren't expecting you for months

ÎÒÃ»À´µÃ²»¼°¸æËßÄã

This is Yana and her father

Alejo.

Hi, Pete!

Nice to meet you.

ÎÒÃÇÀ´ÕâÏë×½Ò»Ö»À¶É«µÄºûµû

-ÏÖÔÚÂð  -Ã»´í

It's a little late in the season, que no?

Yeah, it's a little late, but we're pretty sure

there are still some floating around, right, Pete?

Yeah.

°áËûÃÇµÄÐÐÀî

Long journey?

Yeah. Good to see you.

I'm never tired when I'm coming here,

only when I'm leaving.

It's good to see you.

You too.

Our shaman Diego will tell you

one of our blue butterfly legends.

These legends become more and more precious.

We fight for the forest,

but we fight for our language

and our beliefs just as hard.

Sounds like a good fight.

Pete's a good little fighter himself.

Oh, yeah, I can tell.

He has the eyes of a warrior.

The blue butterfly is a magical creature.

And, at the moment you see it,

you must offer the blue butterfly your dreams

and the blue butterfly

will take your dreams to the Great Spirit.

This is the other side of the story.

Evil spirits inhabit the jungle.

Evil spirits that hide what they are

and become other animals.

But their favourite disguise

is to become Mariposa Azul.

The Blue Morpho uses his beauty

to lead people into the forest

to be lost forever.

That's comforting. Mm?

He says once they are lost,

they will be attacked

by wild tribes.

Okay, that's enough.

Cannibals, headhunters,

who will use with their spears and their knives to dig into...

Are we gonna get our heads cut off?

Yeah. Probably.

There goes my tumour.

ÄãÏÂ¶Ù·¹µÄÈâÀïÈöÁËÄò  ÄãÕâÀÏ¾Æ¹í

Where's Yana's mother?

It was a difficult birth.

She died giving birth to Yana?

Yeah.

These are for her. I'll be right back.

I'm worried about him.

What are you talking about?

Mm m... Nothing.

Oh, come on. Don't pull that crap.

He's got girl problems.

He's in love with a paraplegic girl named Maria.

He likes her

plus she can't walk.

He told you that?

He said what he said. The thing is,

he doesn't have a woman to talk to about it.

He kind of hinted he wanted to talk to you.

Why are you so obsessed with finding me a partner?

Because you date idiots.

You're an idiot.

Forget it.

I just want to catch the morpho

while you guys spend your lives

thinking about things that don't matter.

Mom, stop it. I'm trying to concentrate!

Oh, I'm sorry.

Mom.

What?

I think I'm gonna throw up.

Really? - Really.

Here. Here!

Oh, Pete.

His doctors say that it's okay

for him to be here though, right?

No...

No, they would think bringing him here is crazy.

They also think he's gonna die in a few months.So,

I told them where they could put their craziness.

Okay. Now...

It's Tai Chi.

You keep your weight down, in tune.

Watch how I move.

It's a dance.

You keep your eye on it.

You pivot.

You turn.

You pivot.

You turn.

And you...

And you...swipe!

And that's it

Dragonfly!

Yeah.

Odonata, dragonfly.

And it's a very good sign...

that the blue morpho is still around.

Now you try it.

I'm not sure I can...

On my shoulders.

Up you go. Up !

Can you stand?

Okay, I'll be your legs. You get up.

Atta boy,

okay. You're ready?

Yeah .

Now, we're a team.

It's great up here. I like this view.

Picture the morpho. Picture it, okay?

There it is.

Zooming in, right?

You're ready?

You're ready?

Kingdom . - Kingdom .

Phylum . - Phylum .

Class. - Class.

Order. - Order.

Family. - Family.

Genus. - Genus.

Species. - Species.

No. - No? Is that wrong?

OK. This'll be our first stop.

Remember. The most important: always keep your balance.

There, see that one. Let's give that a try.

Okay.

Way to go, Pete.

That's it. There.

There. - Where?

There.

Go for it.

Higher!

There. - That's it.

You got it?

You should see it, mom. Look at it.

Let's see.

Look at that.

Esperanza Orthoptera.

It looks totally unreal.

Look at that.

Yeah.

I know I thought we'd find it back there,

but this next clearing is really something .

Manolo, bring Pete over.

Rhino Beetle. Genus Megasoma.

Magnificent.

You know it can carry 900 times its own weight?

But we're gonna find the morpho, right?

Yeah,

but I'm trying to show you some things along the way.

Some great things.

Right.

Definitely.

Morphos love water.

The waterfall is irresistible to them!

I think we should head back for today.

Mom? You heard Mr. Osborn.

Morphos love waterfalls.

He knows exactly what he's doing.

Is everything okay?

Pretty good .

Step by step, we're tracking that baby.

We just have to be patient...

How is Pete?

I think he's having the time of his life.

Can I get you something to drink?

No, I'll be fine. Thank you.

You okay?

Yeah. Have a seat.

This is a bit embarrassing, but um...

Pete said you might want to talk to me

about a girl problem?

A girl problem?

Yeah. Yeah, he said you...

you have a paraplegic girlfriend? Maria?

And who are you? Dr.Ruth of the jungle?

Just asking?

No. No girlfriend.

Porque?

Why?

Why is the blue butterfly so important?

What?

Why is the blue butterfly so important?

The blue butterfly?

Because... it's the blue butterfly.

It's a miracle.

Yes, but...

This is also the blue butterfly.

No.

Horn beetle.

You blue butterfly.

Me blue butterfly.

Everything is the blue butterfly.

Todo?

Everything?

No.

Only the blue butterfly is the blue butterfly.

You don't understand anything.

What about you?

Lots of success in the relationship department?

Well, Pete's tried.

He wrote the butcher a love note in my name,

saying how much I loved his pork chops.

And he told the plumber

I had problems with my pipes.

Can I ask what happened to his dad?

He died when Pete was five.

A car accident.

He was killed by a drunk driver.

I'm sorry.

I'm not really the relationship type myself.

I come from a long line of lousy and angry fathers.

I didn't want to become one,

so I collected insects instead .

That sounds lame.

Well, I haven't read your How-To-Be-Perfect book yet.

I hear it's good.

I'm sorry. I was...out of line.

I should get back.

Teresa? I'm...

I'm not at all sure we're gonna catch that butterfly tomorrow.

Trying to move with the whole group, it's...

I'm sure the morpho can hear us

coming like a brass band.

Good night.

Look, mom! Astratogus.

I'll get a jar.

Okay.

I was thinking of what Yana said yesterday.

Maybe I haven't understood anything.

Anyway, catching the Blue Morpho may be a crazy dream,

but dreaming is all I have left...

ÄãµÄÊÕ²ØÓÖ·á¸»ÁËºÜ¶à
You added a lot to your collection.

There's a small swamp we have to cross up here.

Oh, great.

It's okay, mom.

The days are longer and longer.

It's not easy to keep believing,

especially now that mom seems tired of the whole thing.

It's tough on her,

but it's not easy for me either.

You're choking me.

Sorry.

Guys, they're insects. They're sensitive.

I'm lugging a wheelchair through a swamp!

Yeah, it's funny!

Yeah it's funny!

Sorry.

Hey, Pete, you see this?

You see this flower?

You see this little flower...

and this little beetle?

Yeah. - This is the only way!

They depend on each other.

Beetle, pollinator.

No beetle,no flower.

No flower, homeless beetle.

Symbiosis.

Exactly.

Are there snakes in here?

A little quiet, please?

What about crocodiles?

Teresa, we need quiet.

Yeah .

What's that?

I just felt something against my leg!

Jesus! - Mom!

I just felt something against my leg!

Christ! Pete ! You come back here! Pete!

Bring him back here! - He's safe!

Just get out of the water.

Pete, you come on this side!

Alejo, see what it is.

Bring him here!

Oh, my God!

Oh, what's that?

Your mom came and spoke to me last night,

on your advice.

She's nice, huh?

What's that?

Oh, my God!

What I'm about to say is between you and me only,

Okay? You got that?

Yeah .

Maria is my daughter.

She's not paraplegic.

I haven't seen her walk...

because I... abandoned her

and her mother before she could walk,

seventeen years ago.

What are you doing?

Don't move.

What are you doing?

I'm not a hero. I'm not even a good guy.

I'm just good at insects. Okay?

So let's just stick to chasing the morpho.

Isn't that why we came here?

Yeah.

It's okay. Good!

Okay, enough is enough!

Let's get back in and cross to the other side.

Unless you point to a blue butterfly,

I am never going back in that bloody swamp!

If we'd come here two weeks ago,

we'd be in an airplane by now,

headed home with a few morphos.

And now, the last resort:

the oldest and best trick in the book.

Alejo, if you would?

Peach...

Schnapps, which has never failed me,

except when I drank it myself.

Remember, that enchanting story about me

lying in a hammock in sunny Peru.

The insect flies by and changes my life

I was pissed at the gills.

It's the last drink I ever had.

And the insect was the Blue Morpho.

Here.

You're okay?

Everybody, quiet!

And now we wait!

Hey, Pete?

Pete?

Look at that. Ready?

What?

If I wanted him closer,

I would have brought him closer.

The chair is a repellant.

Do you think there's still a chance, Mr. Osborn?

No, I'm a total moron,

and this is a complete show.

Hey, he's just asking .

This is my fault?

No, there's no fault.

We're all just trying to find a blue morpho, right?

Are we?

Clanging wheelchairs. Talking. Bustling.

It'll be okay, Mr. Osborn.

We're having a great day.

God, you know,

I swear I can smell it!

It gives off this beautiful sweet fragrance.

Can you smell it, Alejo?

There's a lot of sweet things here, Alan.

No, that is-

Whatever! Non believers.

There is still a chance.

If we're patient. And no movement.

Mr. Osborn?

I still believe.

When my mom looks at me, I smile back.

I want her to know that I believe in what we're doing,

but deep down I worry.

I'm sorry, Pete.

She spent all her money to get me here.

I want to say "Look around

You'll never see anything so beautiful again. "

but I figured it's the kind of thing

I should keep to myself.

What are you doing, Mom?

I'm pissed off.

We came ten thousand miles.

We saw black ones, yellow ones,

green ones, white ones,

purple, red,

burnt

um ber for God's sake.

Oh, look! A bloody brown one!

Brown! I think you're ugly!

You call yourself the Great Spirit.

Brown?

Would it be too much to ask for one blue one?

That's right. Just push me over.

I'll be a stink bug .

Female?

What is it? - You bet it is.

Get the net. - Female morpho, mom .

And where there's a female, there's a blue male.

We got ourselves a morpho,

Petie-boy. Get that net ready!

I'm ready.

Come on, you son of a... daughter of a...

Lead me to the blue God!

I knew I could smell it.

We're gaining on it!

Okay, when I say now.

Okay?

Now! -I got

Damn it! I couldn't get enough speed .

I knew it was here.

I could smell it. I could.

Pete?

No!

No! Stop!

Pete...

I saw the natives.

You're burning up.

They tried to scream.

But...but they couldn't.

And then we danced.

Just try to breathe deeply.

It's okay. It's okay, baby.

Mom.

What?

I want to go into the rainforest with Mr. Osborn tomorrow.

Yeah, of course we'll go.

No.

I mean

just me and Mr. Osborn.

It's the only way the morpho's gonna come to us.

The group...

It's too big,

too noisy.

You're here because you love me.

Alejo and Manolo.

They're here to carry the stuff.

Me and Mr. Osborn.

We're the only ones here for the butterfly.

That's true...

But I'm your mom.

I have to go.

The morpho knows what's going on, mom.

He knows.

How's Pete?

I've never seen him like that.

He seems peaceful now.

Is he gonna be strong enough to go back

into the jungle tomorrow?

Listen. - Just let me...

say something first.

Seventeen years ago,

I made a decision that changed everything about my life.

Maria's mother decided that she didn't wanna

follow me around while I caught bugs.

Pretty reasonable decision.

But I have been thinking about her,

trying to write her,

and...and wanting to be part of her life.

But am I wanted? You know, I...

I blew it a long time ago.

Pete wants only the two of you to

go into the rainforest tomorrow.

He says...only you two understand.

You know he's letting me go, don't you?

No.

The little bugger.

Because he knows when he dies, it'll kill me.

He's been my whole life.

-He's so brave. - Yeah.

And he's only ten.

He's only ten.

It's a terrible vacation.

Yeah.

If you want him to go alone with me,

I'll... I'll take him.

I will have him back by sundown

and I'll protect him with my life.

If... If you don't want him to go alone,

I'll understand, and I'll tell him.

That's better

if we all go together.

Don't move.

ºÃ
I won't.

I got it.

Thank you.

How does this feel?

Better than on the shoulder.

It's good on the back too.

Okay.

Okay. Let's see if it can carry big Pete.

Wait!

µÈµÈ

For me?

This necklace has a warrior power.

She make it for you

because she say you drink too much soda pop.

Okay.

Just give us a second, please?

You can go with Alan.

You won't regret it.

Not for a minute.

I already regret it.

Mom, remember? Even if I get eaten by

wild pigs or ants or an anaconda,

it'll only take a couple of months of my life.

There is something I really want to tell you.

You're becoming a bit of a smart-ass.

Okay.

Okay, Pete.

Now, I understand what Yana meant.

Magic isn't only the Blue Morpho,

it's every living thing here.

That's why Yana gave me the necklace

not only to protect me,

but to make me part of this life.

Today, right now,

everything is crystal clear to me.

Look who we have here?

You okay?

Fine. You?

I'm good.

Not even one! I can't believe it!

Now, I'm really, really

pissed!

Don't you ever get mad?

About what?

You're a kid, and you're dying .

Let's just stick to catching the butterfly, okay?

Yeah.

Isn't that what you said?

That's what I said .

I'm just not a mad kind of person .

Pete, I want you to know

when I get home I'm gonna contact Maria.

I'm gonna try to make up

for what an ignorant person I've been .

I think she'd like that.

You're great company.

You're mad.

I'm not mad.

Yeah.

Let's just go.

Don't tell me you're not mad.

I'm not mad.

I like you.

I like you too.

Swallowtail

Yeah, you bet it is.

It's paradise.

You want that one for your collection?

No. Blue morpho.

That's all I want.

What?

I'm just wondering

why you keep cutting up fruit

when it doesn't ever seem to help.

The only thing that doesn't seem to help around here is you .

Why don't you grab a knife and do something,

instead of sitting around,

being the poor little kid who can't walk?

Give me a knife.

You know how to use this thing?

Of course, I do.

Catch.

Tell me how to do my job.

I've been doing this for...

Sorry. It just sorta slipped.

Sorry. It just sorta slipped.

Sure. Pick on the kid with the tumour.

That's really classy.

I'll go first.

Okay.

Here goes.

Feels great.

Come on. Just let go.

Ready? Come on! One, two, three!

Can you see the rainbow?

Yeah.

I wanna say that coming here with you

really kicked me in the ass and I...

and I don't appreciate it.

And you know what, Pete?

Everything I say to other human beings is...

pretty much always the wrong thing to say.

But I'm gonna say this:

I don't give a damn what some doctor says.

I think you're gonna live.

My dad was a great guy.

But he wasn't perfect.

My mom doesn't like perfect guys.

Come here.

Are you all right?

Pete?

I think I saw something.

Pete. Pete.

Etch that in your mind.

Keep your eye on it.

Okay.

This is it!

Now!

I got it!

Hang on! Hang on!

Mr.Osborn.

Just hang on.

There's nothing below us!

Okay.

What we have to do is swing,

and then leap to that ledge down there.

Listen.

On the count of three,

I'm gonna leap.

Hang on with everything you got.

One!

On three or right after three?

On three.

It's breaking.

We have to jump now!

Pete!

Damn!

Mr. Osborn?

It's alright.

I'll pull you up.

Mr. Osborn, he set us up.

Give me your hand.

He played with us.

Mr. Osborn?

Are you okay?

Your leg.

Just give me... Give me a second.

Hola, ninos!

Okay.

What are you doing?

I'll get help.

No, you stay right here.

Come here.

You've hurt something inside.

Come here!

Your leg's broken.

What are you doing?

Don't worry, Mr. Osborn . I'll get help.

No, you come back here.

I can do it.

No.

Listen to me.

You'll get lost in five minutes.

I'll be back.

Don't worry.

Pete!

Please come back.

Pete!

It's all your fault.

We had the same rain the first day, remember?

We got back easily.

Let's go.

Pete, Pete, I'm here, baby.

Pete, please, remember. Where's Alan, Pete?

Do you remember? How did you get here?

We were at the biggest waterfall around here.

We fell down the hole.

You know where he means, right?

Yes.

Baby...

It's Mr. Osborn.

How did you get here?

I walked.

You know where he means, right?

I'll take Pete back.

Manolo will go with you. We'll find him.

Go with them.

Yes. Right.

Follow me.

Mr. Osborn.

Mommy.

Is he okay?

How is he? - He's in bad shape.

We have to leave now.

Manolo will help you with your bags.

He lost a lot of blood. - Watch it, Pete!

Here. Here. Gently.

Okay.

My God!

Manolo! Here. Take these!

We didn't catch it but we saw it.

I wouldn't want to catch

Don't tell me you wouldn't want to catch one.

If I did catch one, he'd be sorry.

If you feel that way, I didn't teach you anything .

It's magic.

Remember.

Manolo. Tenga!

Pete!

Mira.

For me?

It's beautiful.

Pete?

Come on, darling. I'm sorry, we have to go.

Manolo.

Gracias.

De nada.

When Yana gave me the Blue Morpho,

I hardly said "Thank you".

I just didn't know how to show her

how happy I was.

I couldn't believe what she was giving me.

It doesn't matter,

because I know she understands

how much it means to me.

My God!

Yana found it.

It's not gonna hurt very much .

Look at you. Just like me.

You don't even get mad about it.

I think you're gonna live.

So I knew at last what I had to do.

Let him fly away

and wait for me to come join him one day.

No one knows why I survived.

Against all odds,

my tumour disappeared.

That's the thing about life!
