[bright Christmas music]

â™ª Oh Christmas tree,
oh Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª Such pleasure
do you bring me â™ª

â™ª For every year
the Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª Brings to us all both
joy and glee â™ª

â™ª Oh Christmas tree,
oh Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª Such pleasure
do you bring me â™ª


[thoughtful music]

I'm thinking we go
with this one.

Okay.
For Christmas.

Come on, Mom, stop.
Okay, okay.

Yeah.



No?


Thank you very much.

You look really pretty, Mom.

Aw, a compliment from my teenage
daughter?

This is gonna be a good show.

[gentle guitar music]

You're getting really good on
that guitar.

Are you sure you don't
wanna play for me tonight?

It's been a long time since
I played live.

Don't be nervous.

Just picture everyone with
their clothes off.

Ew.

Have you seen
everyone out there?

No thank you.

Show time Ms. Rose.

Yes?
What?

Show time?

No, yes, in just a couple
minute.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I thought I heard.

Okay.

Sorry.

ROSE: Sorry for what?

Right this way, Ms. Rose.

Okay.

[crowd cheering]

There she is.

Ready for your big night?

You bet.

We're ready for
you now Ms. Rose.

Okay.
You'll be great, Mom.

Thanks baby.

Oh and I have a reserve
spot for you out in front.

Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

It's a Christmas charity
concert,

not some desert festival.

I'll be fine.

Okay.

Let's do this.

Make sure you keep an eye
on her, okay?

[crowd cheering]

Ladies and gentlemen,

we have a very special
treat for you this evening.

You're gonna see
history in the making

when these two powerhouses
take the stage.

What are you talking about,
Bret King?

Together they've sold more than
22 million albums worldwide.

And their Christmas songs
are still listened to

all around the globe.

Todd, did you know about this?

The show must go on?

This is not what I
signed up for!

He's lost his mind.

Let's kick this holiday
season off right

and give a warm,
Christmas welcome to the Roses.

[crowd cheers and applauds]

Knock 'em dead, Bonnie.

Ashlyn.

Mother.

You look good.

Thanks, can we get on with this?

Yes, well isn't this a Christmas
miracle?

Ladies and gentlemen
you remember my daughter,

Ashlyn Rose.

[crowd cheers and applauds]

And I am Bonnie Rose.

I believe you know us best as
the Roses.

Thank you.

We're gonna sing you one our
biggest Christmas hits.

I think you know this one.

It's called "Let's Rock
This Christmas".

[crowd cheers and applauds]

â™ª Well I've been gone

â™ª Far too long

â™ª Lord, it's been a while

â™ª It's finally here

â™ª That time of year

â™ª We're gonna celebrate
in style â™ª

â™ª Let's rock, let's rock,
let's rock this Christmas â™ª

â™ª That's how we do it

â™ª Get right down to business

â™ª There's a party going on

â™ª Won't you come with us

â™ª Let's rock this Christmas

â™ª Lights are hung

â™ª Mama's dinner's done

â™ª And I'm feeling all right

â™ª So fill my cup,
turn the music up â™ª

â™ª This won't be a silent night

â™ª Let's rock, let's rock,
let's rock this Christmas â™ª

â™ª That's how we do it

â™ª Get right down to business

â™ª There's a party going on

â™ª Won't you come with us

â™ª Let's rock this Christmas

â™ª Let's rock this Christmas

â™ª Let's rock this Christmas

[audience cheers and applauds]

Thank you!

That was fantastic.

Listen to them, they want more.

You two didn't miss a beat.

I suppose this was your doing?

Bret, when will you ever learn?

Like you weren't in on it?

Mother and manager,
plotting against daughter?

Wow, that's dramatic.

Bonnie didn't have anything
to do with this.

That's right.

I am no glutton for punishment.


There it is.

That's the laugh that tells me
exactly where to go.

Yeah, still the martyr I see.

That was amazing.

We were hoping you'd
sign an album

for our silent auction.

Oh, I'd love to.

Sure Todd.

So, I understand our ex-drummer,

or would you prefer ex-husband,

is on tour with Zombie Grease.

I prefer neither from you.

Zombie Grease makes sense.

He is brain dead.

But you know gotta give
it to him.

It's a big tour.

Ladies, can we make it a little
more sugar plum

and a little less Ebeneezer
Scrooge?

BOTH: Bah humbug.

Can we at least keep it down

so we don't make more headlines?

Okay, let it all out.

Well I would say that
I'm surprised by your audacity

but being that you've been
managing my mother for 25 years

obviously your scruples are
outta whack.

You know what, I am gonna go
find my daughter.

Mom, that was amazing.

Riley, you're beautiful.

Thanks.

You can call me Grandma
or Bonnie.

Whatever you want.

Grandma.

Oh shoot.

Oh, I haven't held you since
you were so little.

Why is that, Ashlyn?

I don't know, Mother.

My number's still the same.

Huh, mine is too.

Well, there's no time like
the present

to make up for lost time.

Go sit in the truck, Bret...

Please just hear me out.

I've got some good news.

Look, I hope you can find it in
your frosted old hearts

to forgive me but it
was the only way

to get you two in the
same place.

Your old record label wants
a Roses reunion.

We all do.

BONNIE AND ASHLYN:
No!

I thought you'd say that.

People used to love the Roses.

Oh well.

They still love the Roses.

I uploaded a video of
your performance

and it already has 100,000 hits.

Wow.

Well, there ya go.

And...

This is what they're willing
to pay.

Wow.

Hmm.

People want to see you again.

They really are something
when they're on the same page.

Well we were when your mom let
me take care of business.

More like micromanage my life.

I just wanted you to share the
gifts God gave you.

Not let them fall like pine
needles off a Christmas tree

just because you made
a big mistake.

So, tell me a little bit
about yourself.

Do you play an instrument or?

I mean I could teach you some
of the songs we have.

RILEY: I'm not much of a singer
but I love playing.

That's nice.

Okay, you know what?

This has all been a lot.

I think it's about time
for Riley and I to go home.

Not many people get a
second chance

to share their gift with
the world.

At least agree to come by
my office tomorrow.

We can go over the rest
of the details.

I...

Mom, you have to.

Fine.

I will come by to listen
to the details.

But seriously, Riley, it's time
for us to go home.

Good to see ya again, Ashlyn.

ASHLYN: Yeah, you too, Bret.

RILEY: Bye Grandma.

[gentle music]

Don't even try.

Would you get my things?

I'm gonna go sit in the truck.

[playful music]

Riley Rose!

Breakfast is ready,
come on down!

Okay, I'm dying to know,
how does it look?

What do you think?

It's hard to mess up breakfast

so I wouldn't get too
high on the hog.

I will take that as
a compliment.

My early Christmas gift to you.

Speaking of Christmas,
what do you want this year?

So for once I actually know
what I want.

Okay, let's hear it.

Don't worry, it's not expensive.

Well that's good.

Okay, what is it?

I want Grandma.

Uh, what do you mean?

I want to spend Christmas
with Grandma.

I just want us to be a
family, that's all.

There's a lotta history there.

Well yeah, she's your mom.

Yeah but it's a lot more
complicated than that.

You always tell me how
short life is

and how I should chase
my dreams.

This is all I want this year.

[Ashlyn sighs]

[bright music]

Okay, are you ready for
your warm ups?


Look, you're an internet star.

Well that's a new one,
even for me.

That is a lot of views!

Yeah, it is.

How do you get all those views?

Oh, you know,
when people share it.

Share.

That's a new concept.

[bright music]

How you holding up, Bon?

That was some stunt you pulled.

I shoulda told ya.

But I knew if I did,
you wouldn't show.

She broke my heart when she quit
the Roses

and ran off with that Beau.

I know.

We had such a good thing going
and she just,

she left for some hair brained
idea that...

Love.

People do some crazy things.

Risk a lot for love.

Um hmm.

And once his meal ticket
dried up, he was gone.

Just like I said he'd be.

I know that too.

I was there through it all.

Remember?

I know.

You were a faithful manager
and friend.

But if we do this again

it's got to be different.

ASHLYN: You can say that again.

Oh, I love that we agree
on something.

I didn't give ya a proper
hello last night.

ASHLYN: Hey Bret.

Good to see ya.

You too.

Okay ladies, to your corners.

So, have you given some thought
to the proposal?

Question, what exactly do they
want for this offer?

A Christmas EP.

Two classic Christmas songs
and one original.

A new one?

This says we only have
a few weeks.

Yep.

They want to release the songs
on Christmas Eve.

[Bonnie sighs]

I think it's a great offer.

Especially considering your
illustrious solo careers.

Oh!

Okay fine.

I'll do it.

But then I go my way.

And I go mine.

Great.

So I've lined you up with
Smith Carter.

He's the hottest producer in
the industry right now.

I've also got you a photo shoot
for the promo kit

and a one to one interview.

Wow.

That didn't take long.

I might be grayer but I can
still make things happen.

Well I think you look
distinguished.

Thank you.

Um hmm.

[happy music]

You must be Smith.

Ms. Rose.

It's really great to meet you.

Looking forward to digging
into this with the both of you.

Cool, great.

ASHLYN: Mother.

Ashlyn.

Riley, I'm so glad you came!

I'm Smith.

Hi, I'm...

The Ashlyn Rose.

I dropped the "the" years ago.

This is my daughter Riley.

Hey.

You're here to keep these
two in line?

I do what I can but I make
no promises.

[all chuckling]

So what do you have planned
for your original?

I can only imagine what you have
after all this time.

We don't actually have anything
written yet.

Oh, okay.

Then let's tackle the
other two songs.

What classics have you chosen?

Well, we haven't, yet.

We could always do
"Little Drummer Boy".

to death.

Then by all means, why
don't you choose.

Smith, would you please put
us out of our misery

and choose a song?

Anything but the
"Little Drummer Boy".

Okay, how 'bout
"Hark the Herald Angels Sing"?

Been working on a more modern,
upbeat version

that I think you might like.

I've got a rough instrumentation
to use as a guide track.

If you wanna hear it?

Let's do it.
Cool.

[Bonnie chuckles]

BONNIE: Let's go.

Here it comes.

[bright music]

Do you wanna take that?

Yeah.
Then I'll take?

Then I'll go?

Yep.
Okay.

All right, we can go.

[bright music]

â™ª Hark the herald angels sing

â™ª Glory to the newborn king

â™ª Peace on Earth and
mercy mild â™ª

â™ª God and sinners reconciled

â™ª Joyful all ye nations rise

â™ª Join the triumph of
the skies â™ª

â™ª With angelic hosts proclaim

â™ª Christ is born in Bethlehem

â™ª Hark the herald angels sing

â™ª Glory to the newborn king

Yeah?


That was amazing.

It's okay, you can be happy.

I'm just happy you're happy,
sweetheart.

Any notes?

No.

That was perfect.

Let's call it a day while I play
around with the mix.

Meanwhile you both can figure
out

the next song you wanna do.

Sounds good.

And Ashlyn, I was hoping you'd
come in another time

to lay down some guitar.

I'm gonna add a second guitar
to make it pop.

I was thinking maybe something
like this.

[bright guitar music]

That was great.

Yeah, really something.

But you know, we oughta
get going

because we've got a
lotta work to do

and we gotta get up early for an
interview in the morning.

So.

Hey Riley, we should talk
about [whispers].

It was really great to
meet you, Smith.

You too.

[gentle music]

So the studio and the
upcoming tour

that we're looking forward to.

I mean there's a lot coming
down the pike.

Stick to the music.

Personal lives off limits.

Agreed.

And here they are.

The Roses.

BONNIE AND ASHLYN: Hi.

Ashyln.
Nice to meet you.

Hi there, I'm Bonnie.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

Let's get right into it.

ASHLYN: Okay.

How does it feel seeing how
popular the video

of your performance was?

I think we were both a
little shocked.

Yes, I don't think we realized

how loyal our fans were after
all these years.

We were very touched.

It must feel great being back
in the studio

and recording.

Well there is no place
I'd rather be, honestly.

It's like we never stopped.

Yes.

But you did stop.

For about 15 years when
you both pursued

rather disappointing solo
careers.

Is that what brought you back
together as a duo?

Well our retirement was
pretty public.

So it just felt right for the
Roses to come back.

Um hmm.

Bonnie, how do you reconcile
with the fact

that Ashlyn walked away
from the Roses

and broke up the band?

Well we try not to dwell
on the past.

I mean it was tough,
but that was then.

Hmm.

Ashlyn, your mom can be quoted

saying that she didn't like Beau
Niland, your ex-husband.

Thank you.

I know who Beau Niland is.

She called you silly,
young and impulsive.

Have you worked through those
differences?

Well you know, mothers always
think they know best.

And sometimes they do.

Yeah and as a daughter,

you just really want your mother
to be there for you

and it's disappointing when
she's not.

And it's painful you know,

when you hear through the press

of your daughter's engagement

and subsequent departure from
the band.

Hmm.

How will it be different
this time?

Okay, I thank you for
your questions.

It looks like you got what
you came for.

We're on a very tight deadline

and the Roses need to practice.

Are you guys dating anyone?

Did you get all that?

Well that was a disaster.

And yet I'm not surprised
at all.

You could've controlled yourself
a little more, Ashlyn.

Oh, so now you're blaming
me, again.

You never wanna hear the truth.

Not about Beau, not about
yourself.

Because you're such a great
judge of character, mother.

Hey, we can work through this.

No press is bad press, right?

ASHYLN: No thanks.

This was never going to
work, Bret.

Yeah.

At least we can agree on that.

[thoughtful music]


BEAU: Hey, I'm probably
somewhere making music.

Leave a message.

Hey Beau, I'm sure you're off
living your best life.

But could you please

send the child support for our
daughter that she needs?

So if you could send
the money ASAP

that would be great.

Thanks.


Riley.

What's going on?

Why couldn't you just get along?

I barely started to
get to know her

and you blow it up in one day.

Riley, what happened between
your grandmother and I,

there's a long history there

and I don't know that things

will ever be the same
between us.

I'm sorry.

So when you told me you would do
everything you could

to get me what I wanted
for Christmas,

you meant only if it was
cheap and easy?

No, Riley, these are grown
up problems

and you are not privy to
all the details

that made it not work
out between us.

Didn't work out?

Mom, me not getting the
part of Tiny Tim

in the school Christmas play
didn't work out.

This is way bigger.

This is just you being stubborn.

Riley, wait!


[door lock jangles]

Riley come on.

Please, you know the rules.

No locked doors.

Just leave me alone.

[sad music]

[soft guitar music]

Hello?

Yeah.

Hi, yes the guitar
is still available.

Sure, 10 o'clock tomorrow works.

6 Onetree Lane.


Big dogs.

I hope you're not allergic.

Okay.

No.

No I cannot get Bonnie Rose
to sign the guitar.

Ashyln is.

Do you want the guitar or not?

Great.

See you tomorrow.


[doorbell rings]

[thoughtful music]


Wow, you sure know how to make
a guy feel special.

I'm sorry, I thought you might
be Ashlyn or Riley.

Have you heard from either
of them?

No, I have not.

So I don't know what
to tell you.

I guess the whole thing's off.

Turns out time heals pretty much
nothing with that girl.

Come in. Nope.

Put your jacket on.

You're coming with me.

Bret, would I go out at
this hour?

'Cause you're not sitting around
brooding all night.

I am taking you to dinner.

Bret...

I know you Bonnie Rose

and I know being along in
this house

is not doing you any good.

It's Christmas time.

Let's go enjoy it.

Come on.

[bright music]

Let me get my jacket.

I thought that bringing Ashlyn
back into your life

would make ya happy again.

I thought you two would find a
way to work things out,

you know 'tis the season
and all.

Um hmm.

Well sometimes things can't
be worked out.

They just gotta be worked
through.

So how long before you reach
out this time?

What?

As far as I'm concerned,
the ball is in her court.

How do ya figure?

do this again.

I mean all I did was
care for her.

You know I mean I knew what
was best for her

as her mother and her
business partner

and I did the best I could.

She picked the loser
and I'm the bad guy?

No, I can't do it again.

To be fair, you have picked a
loser too, as well.

the sun wakes up

just to hear you crow.

I'm just saying everyone makes
mistakes.

Okay, well thank you wise one.

Everyone makes mistakes.

Let's drop it.

â™ª The herald angels sing

Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

It's Christmas.

Joy tends to lurk in
every corner.

I'm about 10 seconds away
from a meltdown.

â™ª God and sinner reconciled

â™ª Joyful all ye nations rise

Thank you, if you could keep
moving along,

we'd appreciate it.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.
Thanks!

That wasn't so hard, was it?

I'm gonna need dessert.

I'm gonna need more wine.

Those carolers reminded me
of that time

we got caught in the snowstorm

after the Philadelphia show.

Oh yeah.
Remember?

It's like they appeared out
of nowhere,

little Christmas angels who
kept us company

until the snow plow came.

Remember we called it snow jam?


Oh.

Aw.

You're a great man, Bret.

You really are.

Cheers.

[doorbell rings]


Smith.

I'm, I'm confused.

Well this is awkward.

I was given this address
to pick up a guitar

that was once yours.

Was that you?

Well I guess better
you than a stranger.

Come on in.

Wow, I can't believe
you're selling Rosie.

With all the artists
you've produced,

what makes you want this guitar?

[Smith sighs]
[gentle music]

My mom, she was a huge
fan of the Roses.

And I guess I was, am too.

I figured it'd be a great
addition to my collection.

Especially because we're
working together now.

So, what's up?

Well, sometimes
you have to let go

of the things that you
love for the greater good.

So.

Wait.

You can't.

You're not ready.

You're right.

She's been with me from
the beginning.

I'm sorry if you're in
a tough spot.

I mean, if that's what it is.

I'll figure it out.

Just do me a favor,
don't tell anyone,

especially not my mom.

Yeah, of course.

Yeah, I guess it's just fake
it 'til ya make it.

And then fake it again
in my case.

Ashlyn, there's nothing fake
about you.

[soft guitar music]

Is that Riley playing?

Yeah.

She plays a little.

And she sings too.

Just like you.

She's a really good kid.

She just really wants
my mom around

and I messed that up.

That was over sharing.

No, no, it's nice to see behind
the curtains.

Adds context to the art.

I just wish I could do something
to help you both

finish the record.

I appreciate that.

But when my mom digs
her heels in,

you know that saying
wild horses.

What?

Well it seems to me

that maybe stubbornness runs
in the family.

Maybe.

So maybe it wouldn't be
so terrible

if you gave it another try.

Maybe.

And maybe Riley would like
it if you did too.

And so would I.

All right, all right.

I give.

So I'll see you at the
studio then?

Bring Rosie.

ASHLYN: Thank you.

Really.

Just doing my job.


[bright music]


â™ª Silent night

â™ª Holy night

â™ª All is calm

â™ª All is bright

â™ª Round yon virgin

â™ª Mother and child

â™ª Holy infant

â™ª So tender and mild

â™ª Sleep in heavenly peace

â™ª Sleep in heavenly peace

Wow.

You both still have it.

It took me back to a special
place in my childhood.

Was there ever a doubt?

Mom!

I'm just, I'm just kidding.

I mean there was probably
legitimate doubts

that we would even show
up today.

It felt good out there.

It really did.

We should talk about your
original.

And considering the time
constraints,

I took the liberty of writing
a little something

that I hope you might like.

Let's hear it.

[energetic guitar music]

Wow, that was amazing.

I think I'm beginning to get in
the Christmas spirit.

Yeah, you're quite the
talent, Smith.

Glad you like it.

So, let's try and get back in
the studio in a few days

and we'll knock this outta
the park.

Yeah, but in the meantime we
should get out of your hair

so you can work your voodoo to
make us sound fabulous.

SMITH: Hey Ashlyn.

Yeah?

Would you like to go
out tonight?

Talk about guitars over dinner.

Oh wow.

I would love to, but I have
to pick up Riley

and then we do homework
and dinner.

That sort of thing.

Right.

Well hey, maybe you could
come to a gig I have tomorrow.

If you have time.

I literally don't stay up
past 11 o'clock.

It's the exciting life of a mom.

Well it's at 3 o'clock.

So you'll be home by dinner.

Who has a gig at 3 o'clock
in the afternoon?

I do.

So, I'll text you tomorrow.

You in?

Yeah.

I would love to.

Cool.

See ya then.

You made it.

I did.

This was not what I
was expecting.

You look really beautiful.

Thank you.

Come with me.

I got some people I want
you to meet.

ASHLYN: Okay.


This is Karen and Michelle.

You're in good hands.

These two are my personal
body guards.

Ladies, this is Ashlyn Rose.

Nice to meet you both.

I should get up there.

Don't want them to start a
riot if I start late.

Good luck.

Hi.

What's up everyone?

[audience applauds]

So I just wanna thank you guys
so much for having me back

for our little Christmas
concert.

You guys know how much I enjoy
spending time with you.


Carol!

I know that was you.

[crowd chuckles]

â™ª Up on the housetop reindeer
pause â™ª

â™ª Out jumps old Santa Claus

â™ª Down the chimney with
lots of toys â™ª

â™ª For all the little ones,
the Christmas joy â™ª

â™ª And ho, ho, ho who
wouldn't go â™ª

â™ª Ho, ho, ho who wouldn't go

â™ª Up on housetop click,
click, click â™ª

â™ª Down the chimney with
old Saint Nick â™ª

[audience applauds]

ASHLYN: That was amazing.

And so incredibly sweet.

Well, as the cliche goes I
get more out of it

than they'll ever know.

I have a million questions.

Like what made you start
doing this?

Well my grandma stayed there

and it would always make
her so happy

when I'd visit and play.

I loved seeing her lit up like
a Christmas tree.

I just had to keep coming back.

So you're the joy bringer.

The joy bringer.

I like that.


You know a lot of 'em don't
have any families

or they've been forgotten about.

So they go there for sense
of community.

No one should be left alone.

Especially on Christmas.

Like my mother.

I mean that's really special.

And they love you.

I mean they really love you.

Yeah, especially Carol.

Oh I felt more than one
set of eyes

burning a hole in the
back of my head.

I mean I feel lucky that I
just got outta there

in one piece.

So you must've always had a
musical Christmas then.

We did.

Back when I was 20, but my mom,

she passed away unexpectedly.

I'm so sorry.

Thank you.

What was she like?

Oh God, she was amazing.


What resonates with me most is
just how selfless she was.

She'd always remind me
to consider

what the person next to me
was going through

before I got caught up
in my own life.

There you go.
Thank you.

Yes, thank you.
Enjoy.

What?

She loved, I mean really
loved the Roses.

Every Christmas we would listen
to your albums on repeat.

She'd be crazed to know I'm
producing your album.

That's so sweet.

I'm just happy

that we could be a part of your
memories with her.

Yeah you know I guess
I just learned

to appreciate what you have
while you have it.

'Cause you never know.

That is really good advice.

Want some other unsolicited
advice?

Sure.

Eat that pie and get
a piece to go.

I don't know what's they're
doing to it,

but it's the best pie I've
ever had in my life.

Really?
Yeah.

Hmm.

[happy music]

Umm, that's good.

It's real good.

Hey, you wanna take a break
from the homework

and help me decorate the
Christmas tree?

I'm not doing homework.

What are you doing?

I'm trying to write my own song.

Oh.

I can't wait to hear.

Hey I just, I want you to know

that I'm doing my best.

You know but sometimes life is
a box of Christmas lights.

You know ya pull 'em outta
the box every year

and sometimes they're all
tangled up and knotted

and sometimes the lights
are broken

but you don't know which
one it is

so ya don't know how to fix it.

Sometimes life's just
a big ol' mess.

Okay, well I will help you
decorate the tree

if you wanna help me bake
cookies for my

school fundraiser.

Deal.

And I was thinking maybe
you could join us

at the photo shoot tomorrow.

Grandma will be there.

A photo shoot?

Talk about needing help.

You just need me there to
do your makeup.

Oh really?

Oh I'm sorry, what are you
talking about?

[happy music]

Wow.

This is spectacular.

This is pretty cool, Mom.

If it isn't my three favorite
ladies.

There's my moral support.

Wow Bret, this look amazing.

Thank you for setting it up.

Anytime.

We'll see how this one goes.

Hey!

And there's my moral support.

Wow, looks awesome.

I thought you would be in the
studio working on our album.

I think it's great that
he's here.

Get him in some promo shots.

Uh huh.

Ashlyn, you look great.

You look fantastic.

Thank you, Mother.

You know, you might wanna
rethink the lipstick.

It's okay, I'm sure they
can change it.

Here we go.

What?

I'm just saying.

Just saying that you have to
have your two cents

on everything in my life.

Actually you are both wearing
the wrong shade of lipstick.

And you are not highlighted or
contoured nearly enough.

Don't worry, I can fix it.

Let's go Roses.

Lead the way.

I had no idea I needed to
brighten my eyes.

And this is not a color
I would normally use.

Do you trust me?

Of course I do.

I would say you're my
go to girl.

But don't forget how beautiful
you are without makeup.

It's self expression, Grandma.

It's empowering to choose how
I want to show myself

to the world.

Everything okay in here?

Yeah, but we could use some
get ready music.

I can make that happen for ya.

â™ª We wish you a merry
Christmas â™ª

â™ª We wish you a merry

â™ª We wish you a merry

â™ª And a happy new year

â™ª Good tidings we bring for
you and your kin â™ª

â™ª Good tidings of Christmas

â™ª We wish you a merry

â™ª We wish you a merry

â™ª We wish you a merry

â™ª And a happy

[bright music]

â™ª Look at the moon

â™ª Singing a lonely tune

â™ª And I'd be singing a
tune without you â™ª

Thank you.

â™ª The words won't do

â™ª I know you know

â™ª But still I wanna show

This is weird.

[Ashlyn laughs]

One, two, three.

â™ª No work of art now

â™ª To show what I feel for you

Grandma.

â™ª There's only one way
I could start â™ª

â™ª Just listen to my heart

â™ª Listen to my heart

â™ª It's the only place to start

â™ª So listen to my heart

What's wrong, Grandma?

Oh I've just missed this
so much.

Oh, lucky for you
I am right here.


I missed you.

Okay?

Wait oh here.

Get in here.

No.
Yes.

Oh stop it!


You guys, come on in.

You too.

Let's do a family photo.

Three generations.

And the manager.

For some reason.

So, me and my mom are baking
Christmas cookies after this.

Do you wanna come over and help?

Are you kidding?

Love to.

ASHLYN: That's a nice shot.

If it's okay with your
mom of course.

Everyone put a hand up.

Come on.

Who wants to help us
bake cookies?

[Bret chuckles]

Okay, well I guess everyone's
coming over

to bake some cookies.

Mom, would you like to join us?

I would love to.

I gotta get these photos to
the label,

but I volunteer to be the
official tester.


Sneaky.

[happy music]

These are so good.

Your mom and I baked those
every single year.

One of my earliest Christmas
memories

is of us making these cookies.

It was a mandatory Christmas
tradition.

It was.

Sprinkles were here favorite
thing.

Maybe that's why it's the
only thing

that I'm actually good at making
in the kitchen.

But you were always over
my shoulder

making sure I followed the
recipe to the letter.

Well there are rules to
be followed

to get the desired results.

Oh, with cookies of course.

Of course.

Among other things.

Wow, this is pretty cool.

Where'd you get it?

I gave that to Ashlyn after our
first show together.

Oh the song is...

First Noel.

Yeah, I know it well.

It's my mom's favorite.

Oh.

It was the first song

that Ashlyn and I ever sang
together on stage.

ASHLYN: That was a good show.

It was a good show.


What's up Riles?

It's Dad.

He just texted me.

Oh boy.

What'd he say?

His tour is bringing back
through town on Christmas Eve.

And he wants to hang
out with me.

Oh, he's calling.

Hi Dad.

No.

Excuse me?

It's not your decision.

Well then it's my opinion,
you should say no.

He's her father.

If she wants to have a
relationship with him

then she can make that decision.

Ashlyn, it's your job
to protect her.

Protect her from her father?

From everything.

Your father wanted to see you
again after he left,

but I protected you.

Dad actually wanted to see me?

Maybe I should go too.

No stay, this won't take long.

He only came back when the Roses
started to take off.

He didn't care about us.

He cared about the money.

I can't believe you kept
him away from me.

It's more like I kept him from
breaking your heart again.

It wasn't your decision to make.

I was the one who raised you.

I was the one who kept you safe.

Safe from him, safe from
all those people

that could've taken advantage of
you in the music industry,

it was you and me.


'Til that drummer swooped in

and took you away from me
anyway, didn't he?

That drummer was my husband.

And the father to my beautiful
daughter.

He actually saw something in me

that you never wanted to see.

He actually encouraged me to
do what I wanted to do.

And what was that?

To find my own identity,

one outside of being one
of the Roses.

You were suffocating me.

Hmm, well pardon me for wanting
the best for you.

Maybe it's not the best
time to take...

You know, this is none of
your business.

You know, we don't need
any of this.

That's just what you
want, right?

To get out from under my thumb.

[door slams]


Well, maybe she'll be
just like you

and not talk to you
for 15 years.

You guys are unbelievable.

Just as bad as the tabloids
said.

Riley was happy all day today.

We all were.

I was wrecked when I lost
my mom and grandma.

Riley has you both but
neither of you

can look past your own noses
to see what you have.

Your music, it brings joy to
people.

To me, even.

But I gotta say,
you pretty much do

the exact opposite to everyone
around you.

Smith.


Your turn.


[sad, thoughtful music]


Riley.

Too soon.

Come on Riles.

We shouldn't have got into
it like that.

Riley come on.

Please, no locked doors.

I'm sorry.


[phone buzzes]

Hey Bret.

Hey to you.

Got the proofs back on
the photos.

They're incredible.

You and Ash have copies
in your inbox.

So many good ones we can use.

I even got a favorite.

Listen.
You see the chemistry

between you two in every shot.

It's nice seeing you guys
getting along so well.

About that.
What?

Oh please don't tell me there's
a problem.


Christmas Eve is in three days.

What are you doing?

Are you available right now?

Don't answer that.

I'm coming over.

I... [phone beeps]

Bret?


What are you so happy about?

[playful music]

Okay Christmas angel,

could you please send me some
of your Christmas joy?

I sure could use it right now.

[knocking at door]

Tell me all about it.

We can fix this.

I don't know what to say.

I'm just really sorry.


We were doing so well.

I thought maybe we could get,
you know close again.

You both gave it a good effort.

Oh, she's just so stubborn.

What?

Now I want you to take this
with all the care

with which it is intended.

Spit it out.

Ashlyn is indeed a very
stubborn woman.

Well cheers to that.

And so are you.

I beg your pardon?
Oh come on, Bonnie.

You're two peas in a pod.

Even if the pod bursts apart.

Same stubborn thoughts that are
running through your head

are running through hers.

I have a question for you and
I want you to be honest.

More honest than I've been?

Well let's say as honest as
you've been so far.

Okay.


[thoughtful music]


I think you love hard.

And yes, it can come across
as overbearing.

I know where your heart is,
but sometimes I can imagine

it can be hard for others
to see.

Well I don't know any
other way to be.

Truth is, she's as independent
as you are.

So naturally she pulls
when you push.

Who died and made you the
relationship expert?


I wouldn't say
I'm a relationship expert.

But, I'm pretty sure
I'm a Bonnie expert.

I'll give you that.

I just pushed really hard to
make this happen.

Well let's just say your
reputation's preceded you

and people are just afraid

to let you back on the same
stage together again.

Think about it, I literally
had to trick you

into performing with your
own daughter.

And vice versa.

You must see how ridiculous
that is.

I didn't ask you to do that.

Of course not.

You gals are the ones with
the talent.

I just wanted you to see how
special what you have is.

I don't need your help, Bret.

I didn't say you did, Bon.

over here tonight,

to let me know that this reunion
idea of yours

was like some sort of a favor?

Look, Bonnie, slow down.

I'm here because I wanna be.

Because this grand scheme of
yours has failed.

I kinda stuck my neck out here.

In more ways than one.

I didn't ask you to do that.

I learned a long, long time ago

that the only person that I
can rely on is myself.

Bonnie Rose, I've known you
for 22 years.

22.

And I've done everything
I can to show you

how important you are to me.

Now you tell me one time,
just one when I've let you down.

Right.

Goodnight Bonnie.


Nice job, Ashlyn.

Hmm.

â™ª Holy infant

â™ª So tender and mild

Bonnie.

I'm not here to argue or
cause trouble.

We're all professionals.

Okay.

There's a lot of work
to be done.

And there are a lotta butts
on the line,

not just mine and Ashlyn's.

I know.

Okay, good.

So, what do you have in mind?

I was thinking that maybe
I could come in

and record my part and then
Ashlyn could come in

and record hers and
then we could,

you know get this done without
all the contention.

Let me take a look at the song

and I'll see what I can do in
the timeframe we have.

Well, we don't necessarily
have a song.

Of course you don't.

What's that supposed to mean?

Well because that would require

the both of you working together
for more than a day or two.

Which in hindsight,
seems impossible.


â™ª Holy infant

â™ª So tender and mild

[playful music]

Have a good day at
school, Riley!

[phone dings]


[happy music]

Now we wait.

Hi.
Hey.

I wanted to apologize.

I'm...

I'm sorry.

I overreacted yesterday and
things got a little outta hand.

I'm embarrassed about it.

Hello Mother.

BONNIE: Ashlyn.

ASHLYN: Could you give
us a second?

Oh, sure.

It's okay.

We're all professionals and
we're here to record a song.

Right?

Right.

Absolutely.

So, you both ready to record the
song you don't have?

Well I was hoping that maybe
we could use

the melody from that song that
you played last time.

If that's okay with you.

Sure.

We can do that.

Okay.

And Ash... Lyn, Ashlyn,

well you've always been so great
with your poetic lyrics,

maybe we could start with that.

Sure, I've got the beginning of
something we can use.

Okay.
Okay.

I'll lay it down,
play it in the booth for you.

Thank you.

[Clears throat]
So.

[playful music]

Well I'll umm...

[happy music]

Wow, you really write small.

It's a small book, Mother.

Surely you can see it's
a small book.

Here it comes.

â™ª The bells ring hear my
spirit sing â™ª

â™ª With this Christmas joy
you bring â™ª

What?

Well it's really pretty.

It really, really is.

It just, it feels generic to me.

Ah, here we go.

Why don't you try that line
right there.

Would it matter if I said no?

What, you don't want my input
into our song?

â™ª The snow, the lights,
the twinkle in your eyes â™ª

No?

Okay.

â™ª Here I am another Christmas,
another crazy Christmas â™ª

â™ª My mother's right,
no matter what â™ª

â™ª Dear Christmas why me

[Bonnie laughs]

â™ª Here we are another Christmas
another crazy Christmas â™ª

â™ª My daughter's never wrong

â™ª Not even for the sake of
a Christmas song â™ª

â™ª Why me

â™ª I don't want to write
anymore â™ª

â™ª Look over there it's
the door â™ª

You made me come here.

You're a grown woman, dear.

Maybe you both should go home

and write something real that
we can record.

So we can all fulfill our
contracts.

[Smith sighs]
Oh man.

Oh good, save me.

Got a text from Bonnie, she told
me she's gonna fix things

and get the last song recorded.

Oh, yeah.

They working on a song
right now?

They're laying something down.

Well, can I hear it?

Sure.

BONNIE: Why can't you
forgive me?

We will never agree.

That man, he took you
away from me.

At least I took a chance
on love.

Mom, you have had the same sweet
man knocking on your door

for 22 years.

I mean even for you that's sad.

I've heard enough.

[Bonnie sighs]

[Smith sighs]

ASHLYN: Guess they didn't like
our song.

Shocking.

[gentle music]

[Bonnie sighs]

â™ª All is calm

â™ª All is bright

â™ª Round yon virgin

â™ª Mother and child

I don't mean to bother you,

but are you Bonnie Rose?

I suppose I am.

Could you, would you mind

singing a Christmas carol
with us?

It would be a huge honor.

Can I make a deal with you?

Come on.

So.

["The First Noel"]


â™ª Born is the king of Israel

â™ª Noel, Noel

â™ª Noel, Noel

â™ª Born is the king of Israel

â™ª Noel, Noel

â™ª Noel, Noel
-Grandma?

â™ª Born is the king

â™ª Of Israel

BONNIE: Thank you.

Goodnight.
Merry Christmas.

My mother.

Always a show stopper.

I never meant to make this the
Bonnie Rose show.

I'm sorry if I held you back.

It wasn't just you, Mom.

I just needed to fail on my own

to know how much I needed you.

How much we needed each other.

Get on inside!

Come on!

[bright music]

â™ª Fa la la la la

â™ª Oh

â™ª Fa la la la la la la la la

[women laughing]

â™ª Deck the halls with boughs
of holy â™ª

â™ª Fa la la la la la la la la

â™ª Tis the season to be jolly

â™ª Fa la la la la la la la la

â™ª Don we now our gay apparel

â™ª Fa la la la la la la la la

â™ª Troll the ancient yuletide
carol â™ª

â™ª Fa la la la la la la la la


Yeah, I mean I like that.

Yeah, I think we've got a
really good song here,

don't you?

I love it.
I do too.

We're just missing the bridge.

What's a bridge?

Oh a bridge is what brings the
whole song together.

It connects the end of the song
with the beginning.

Yeah, no bridge, no song.

Yep.
Maybe, let's do...

[Bonnie humming]
I like this.

So when we do.
Yeah.

Oh that's, that's not bad.

[gentle guitar music]

â™ª Tis the season to remember
everything that you've got â™ª

â™ª Make them know, everyone that you love â™ª

â™ª That they're all loved

â™ª Beautiful,
indisputable truth â™ª

â™ª And every time you hear this song â™ª

â™ª You know how much
I love you â™ª

Does that work for a bridge?

Um no.

That doesn't just work,
I think you made a hit song.

Really?
Yes.

Come here.

Oh my God.

Riley Rose,
where did that come from?

I just write stuff and try
to put it to music.

That's just like your mom.

Wow, you were, that was amazing!

Okay listen, we've gotta get
back to the studio

while we still have this
Christmasy thing going on

and we're running outta
time, okay?

I will call Smith.

But Mom, could you do
me a favor?

BONNIE: Of course, anything.

[Piano Music]

Smith, I owe you an apology.

For what?

For being stubborn,
for being selfish.

I think I was so afraid
of being hurt

that I just closed myself
off to everyone.

To you, to my mother,
and I let Riley down.

It's okay.

No.

It's not.

So, do you think you
can forgive me?

Well, it is Christmas.

And speaking of Christmas,
I have something for you.

Is that what I think it is?

From the best diner in town.

This is awesome.

I actually have something
else too.

No Ashlyn.

Just open it.

Okay.

Come on.

I can't.

Well you have to.

I mean it'd be pretty weird if
I was playing a guitar

that I already signed, right?

Pretty weird.

Thank you.

I can't begin to tell you how
much this means to me.

BONNIE: Hey.

What did we miss?

I think we've got a
song to record.

â™ª I thought I knew all the
things that I had to know â™ª

â™ª I thought I grew in the ways

â™ª That I had to go
-There they are.

â™ª I let you go,
I stepped out on my own â™ª

â™ª But the winter's cold

â™ª The winter's cold

â™ª I'm coming home

â™ª I'm coming home

And a merry Christmas Eve
to you listeners.

You heard it here first.

That was the brand new hit
Christmas single by

the Roses.

It looks like a Christmas
comeback.

[knocking at door]

Come in.

Hey Bon.

What brings you this way?

You.

I wanted to see you because
I have a few things to tell you.

I owe you an apology.

I've been taking you for granted

and acting like a spoiled child.

We've had too many highs

to let one low get in the way
of a good thing.


I have been so afraid of
getting hurt again

that I've let it come
between us.


Not afraid.

What?

You are tough.

And admitting you were afraid,
just made you even tougher.

I brought something for you.

Oh you didn't need to
get me anything

for crying out loud.

Well, I kinda did.

It's the least I could do.

You gave me that beautiful song,
label loves it.

They just played it on WZPZ.

Yeah, that's good.

That's good.

Have a look.

I owe you one more apology.

I almost lost everything again.

But it made me realize

what was in front of me
the whole time.

You're the only man who has
never let me down.

It has been my absolute pleasure
all along.

I love you, Bret.

I just hope I'm not too late.

I've loved you for 22
Christmases.

Nothing was gonna get in
the way of 23.

What took you so long?

I've been told I'm stubborn.

You don't say?

Oh hey, I didn't expect you
back so early.

So, how'd it go?

It was good.

He flies back tonight for a
Christmas show tomorrow.

Oh, wow.

So what'd you do?

We ate and we talked.

And we listened to your song,
Mom, it was awesome.

I think he was jealous.

Oh really?

And he gave me these.

I think he thinks I'm a drummer.

Okay, well maybe it's wishful
thinking.

He told me he's gonna try
and get better

at keeping in touch.

But I'm not holding my breath.

And he wanted me to
give you this.

Wow.

I'm sure he's gonna do his
best, sweetheart.

Just know that you always have
me and your grandmother.

You brought this family
back together.

You're our Christmas miracle.

I know.

[both laughing]

Speaking of which,
it is Christmas Eve.

Would you like to open
your present

or are you over that now?

No way, I want to.

Okay, well there is one gift

that I would like to give you

before we go over to your
grandma's in the morning.

Okay, you're totally not gonna
guess what it is.

Okay, you ready?

[Ashlyn exclaims]

Oh my gosh.

Do you like it?

RILEY: Thank you.

I love it.

Well I figured you've been
playing mine for so long

it's about time that you
deserved one

of your very own.

Thank you, Mom.

I love you, Riley Rose.

Mom.

Okay, I just had to have
one mom moment.

I love you too.

what was that?

RILEY: I love you too.

Okay, just a little bit.

I love you too.

Oh!

â™ª He's the reason I can say

â™ª I'll be home by Christmas
Eve â™ª

â™ª Wrapped up beneath the tree

â™ª A gift to you from me

â™ª Deck the halls with boughs
of holy â™ª

â™ª Don't forget to pray
for snow â™ª

â™ª Watch the scene
change while I'm driving â™ª

â™ª Christmas time
I'm coming home â™ª

There.
Perfect, thank you.

Yeah, that feels good.

There they are,
those handsome men.

Well, are you guys excited?

Super excited.

Riley?

How are they doing?

They haven't missed a beat.

Well, should we do this?

Let's do it.

Okay.

I love you.

I love you too.

Go get 'em.

I will.

WOMAN: Standing by.

[audience cheers and applauds]

They need no introduction,

but I'm gonna do it anyway.

Ladies and gentlemen, the Roses!

[audience cheers and applauds]

Thank you, Mr. Rose.

She never gets tired of
saying that.

I don't.

Hey everyone, we are so blessed
to be here

with you on this beautiful
Christmas Eve.

This has been an incredible
year.

And we could not think of any
place we'd rather be

than right here in our hometown
with all of you.

[audience cheers and applauds]

So this next song that we're
gonna play for you

is a very special song,

because it talks about how
important family is.

Especially at Christmas.

All right, ready?

[audience cheers and applauds]

â™ª I thought I knew all the
things that I had to know â™ª

â™ª I thought I grew in the
ways that I had to go â™ª

â™ª I let you go,
I stepped out on my own â™ª

â™ª But the winter's cold yeah,
the winter's cold â™ª

â™ª And all the lights shining
bright on the boulevard â™ª

â™ª Remind me of better times
before things got hard â™ª

â™ª The same old song,
another year has gone â™ª

â™ª Around the tree ain't the
same if it's not you and me â™ª

â™ª Falling snow, mistletoe

â™ª Red and gold, all for naught

â™ª If we are apart

â™ª When the bells ring out
on Christmas morn â™ª

â™ª I will be right where
I belong â™ª

â™ª No one should ever be alone
at Christmas â™ª

â™ª I'm coming home

â™ª I saw the change in your
eyes when you spoke to me â™ª

â™ª Forgiving tone in your
voice, could this really be â™ª

â™ª A miracle, blessed and
lyrical â™ª

â™ª I don't need a present
baby, this is all I ask for â™ª

â™ª Falling snow, mistletoe

â™ª Red and gold, all for naught

â™ª If we are apart

â™ª When the bells ring out
on Christmas morn â™ª

â™ª I will be right where
I belong â™ª

â™ª No one should ever be alone
at Christmas â™ª

â™ª I'm coming home

Ladies and gentlemen,
my daughter, Riley Rose!

[audience cheers and applauds]

â™ª Tis the season to remember
everything that you got â™ª

â™ª Make it known to everyone
you love â™ª

â™ª That they're loved a lot

â™ª Are beautiful, indisputable
truth â™ª

â™ª Every time you hear
this song â™ª

â™ª Remember that I love you

â™ª When the bells ring out
on Christmas morn â™ª

â™ª I will be right where
I belong â™ª

â™ª No one should ever be alone
at Christmas â™ª

â™ª I'm coming home

â™ª When the bells ring out
on Christmas morn â™ª

â™ª I will be right where
I belong â™ª

â™ª No one should ever be alone
at Christmas â™ª

â™ª I'm coming home

â™ª I'm coming home

[audience cheers and applauds]

â™ª Well I've been gone

â™ª Far too long

â™ª Lord it's been a while

â™ª It's finally here,
that time of year â™ª

â™ª We're gonna celebrate in
style â™ª

â™ª Let's rock, Let's rock â™ª

â™ª Let's rock this Christmas

â™ª That's how we do it,
get right down to business â™ª

â™ª There's a party going on,
won't you come with us â™ª

â™ª Let's rock this Christmas

â™ª Lights are hung

â™ª Mama's dinners done

â™ª And I'm feeling alright

â™ª So fill my cup

â™ª Turn the music up

â™ª This won't be a silent night

â™ª Let's rock, Let's rock â™ª

â™ª Let's rock this Christmas

â™ª That's how we do it,
get right down to business â™ª

â™ª There's a party going on

â™ª Won't you come with us

â™ª Let's rock this Christmas

â™ª Let's rock this Christmas

â™ª Let's rock this Christmas
