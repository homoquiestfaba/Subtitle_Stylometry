[somber orchestral music]


I feared the inevitable.

It had waited on the horizon,
but now it was before me.

This wedding did not
begin a new life for me,

but rather, ended the only one I'd known.

My father, Jimmy Bombay,
chose this fate for me.

I was to wed Dante Calivari,
the son of a Cartel drug lord

and diamond runner from Russia.

I had tried everything I could think of

to avoid this moment.

But what I've learned in life

is that when you are stripped
of all that you have,

you either fold your
cards, or leave your mark,

and this was mine.

[gun fires]
[guests scream]

[brooding electronic music]

[ominous tones]

Father, I have sinned.

Forgive me. It's been too
long since my last confession.

You seem troubled. What's wrong?

done something unforgivable.

God will forgive you, if
your heart is truly repentant.

So, don't worry.

You can talk to me. I'm not
here to judge you, dear.

I'm just here to listen and to counsel.

sinned against my family.

Last week, I was a bride.

And this week, you're a wife.

sinned against my husband.

How have you sinned?

in a most unforgivable way.

Were you unfaithful?

not that I was unfaithful

to my husband.

It's that I killed him.

[eerie music]

Dante Calivari.

[tense music]

[distant sirens wail]

Dante successfully worked
the Miami drug scene

when my father met him.

[guns fire]

[gun fires]

[gun fires]

Dante worked alongside
his girlfriend, Angela,

who set up customers for him.

[water splashes]

Lou Bishop, his trusted bodyguard,

also worked the Miami streets with him.



He was living the high-life.

Dante and his drug-dealing
Barbie doll had quite the scheme.

Angela would set up the
coke deals around town

and Dante worked distribution,

using the direct supply line
from his family overseas.

seat. I must talk to you.

How've you been?

Very good.

brought Lou Bishop as well with.

I want you to understand something.

I think your father has
been most unreasonable

with his prices with me.

It is my goal to distribute
product through Miami

and all of Florida, but these prices,

Dante, they are unacceptable.

You must talk to your father.
They can not continue.

[gun fires]

[dramatic music]

Immediately, my father knew the potential

of Dante's small operation.

Things quickly grew for him

and my father became
more heavily involved.

No matter how hot things
got with the police,

nothing would stop Dante.

He just became more cocky and brazen,

brokering daylight drug
deals out in the open.

[gun fires]

The police took notice.

[gun fires]

But nothing stopped Dante.
[engine roars]

He just kept dealing.

To him, this was a way of
life, and he was loving life.

No matter what the police did,

Dante was always one step ahead.

He couldn't be touched.

Things were going perfectly for him.

At least, that's what
he thought, at the time.

[gun cocks]

Life was smooth sailing for Dante

and his little drug-dealing scheme,

except he had one small problem.

There was a cop, hot,

hot on his trail.

And that cop was Angela's partner.

Yep.

Little Angela was a cop, and
they were closing in on Dante.

[muffled radio chatter]

Dante was betrayed,

and it wasn't long before
it was lights-out...

[gun cocks]

For Officer Angela.

[gun fires]

Dante's father was outraged
at his sons indiscretions.

Dante had destroyed their
entire plan for a US operation,

and his visa was about to expire.

A visa? Is that why you
were gonna get married?


This immigration problem
left the door wide-open

for my father to move in.

Immediately, he began
supplying Dante with weapons,

man-power and money,

to ensure the success of his master plan.

By selling me to the Calivaris,

my father would guarantee
his place in the Cartel.

What kind of man is gonna
sell his daughter to a cartel?

[Jacqueline chuckles]

And you're telling me there was
nothing you could have done?

You couldn't have walked away?

There wasn't someone
you could have gone to?

What about your mother? Where was she?

Couldn't she have helped
you with some of this?


I'm sorry.

me and Dad after that.

So there was nothing you
could have done? Nothing?


[priest sighs]

[peaceful piano music]

[glass clinks]

To my fiance, who I
love, and who loves me.


[guests laugh]

So when is this going to happen?

It's going down tomorrow.

You are going to move it all?

But the wedding is at the end of the week.

I would never let this
interfere with the wedding.

This will only take a day or so.

We'll take it down to Salerno River

and out to the Hutchison Bay.

Why isn't my fiance
dining with us tonight?

She's ill. Lying up in her room.

Well, then I guess
I must go and see her.

[elevator dings]

Because, when I go, I want
everything set up right.

You won't lose me, but this
is the only way to get me.

Babe, listen, I gotta go.
[suspenseful music]

It would've been nice of you

to have joined us this evening.

I was sick.

It was rude.

Get dressed.

I don't want to.

Get dressed.

No.

fucking feet and get dressed!

[ominous music]

You will obey me.

Does it make you feel hard?

To beat up on a girl.

Do you like how it feels?

Does it make you feel strong?




I am so, so sorry that happened to you.

But rest assured, God
will wreak his vengeance

on those who attack his children.

Was this the first time that your fiance

displayed this kind of violence?

No. It wasn't the first time.

But it was the last.

I had a plan to escape, but
I needed the help of Rick.


Rick? Who's Rick?

Rick was the man I loved.

And he died.

Because of me.

[smooth jazz music]
[cards flick]

What's your bet?

[chips clink]

What?

You know, we're all one of three people.

You're either who your
friends think you are,

who you think you are,
or who you really are.

It all came down to one thing.

Stack 'em up, push 'em in, roll the dice.

Bourbon?

[whiskey trickles]

So what's your one thing?
What is it that drives you?

What do you want?

I met this girl with a problem.

What kind of problem?
A marriage problem.

Well you're not married,
so it's not your problem.

Exactly.

So what does she want?
Out.

And what's the deal?

Simple plan. She needs out.

The score is easily mid to
upper-level seven digits.

A move out?

So, why me?

I need someone who's been in the game.

I've been in the game,
and I've been in the can.

Now, I'm out. I risk my neck for no one.

Look.

If the girl was worth it,
then she is the score.

So, who is it? Who are these people?

Do you remember Nick
Carson or John Knight?

Excuse me?

Do you know who Jimmy Bombay is?

[ominous music]

You should know better than this!

What're you telling me this for?

This, this girl.

I don't wanna know about it!

Jack!
I don't wanna hear it!

I don't wanna know about it!
Jack, you don't understand.

I don't wanna hear it!

I don't wanna fuckin' know about it!

Lock up before you leave!

I don't give a fuck, man!

[door slams]

[helicopter blades whir]

in prison changed Ace.

He knew he couldn't go back to
his old life on the outside.

[sirens wail]

Once he was released,
Ace moved back to Miami

and started managing Club Reno,

where he made it a point to
avoid his old life of crime

and Jimmy Bombay, the
kingpin and mastermind

of the crime underworld in South Florida.

As Ace left Club Reno that night,

his anger grew at the very
thought of Jimmy Bombay.

No matter how much time had gone by,

Ace's past continued to haunt him,

threatening to make itself known again.

And just like that, Ace
knew his past had found him.

Years before Ace had worked the
streets of Miami with Jimmy.

Together, they became partners

in what later became my
father's crime empire.

Despite their partnership,
a delicate balance of power

existed between my father and Ace.

One always trying to outdo the other.

[boat engine roars]

On one of their jobs,
Ace cut an unlucky break,

and was thrown in jail,

leaving my father to build
his vast criminal operation.

[boat engine roars]

My father ran a tight crew.

John Knight, his second Lieutenant,

oversaw the import of cocaine
from the Caribbean and weapons

from South America into my
father's South Florida territory.

Equally impressive was
the operation necessary

to move the weapons and cash.

[tires screech]
[car engine roars]

Nick Carson transported my father's assets

to the Grand Bahamas,
making bi-weekly trips

to deposit the money
into numbered accounts.

[plane engines roar]

[tires screech]

From the back alleyways of Little Havana,

to the Palm Beach social elite,

Bombay controlled all vice.

And I know your situation was dire, but,

didn't you have a plan and where
did Rick fit into all this?


and my father's plan was
to deposit the diamonds

and drug money that sold
my life to the Cartel

into his offshore bank
account the next morning.

I thought it was perfect.

As if they were playing
right into my hand.

The night before,

my father had all his most
trusted men prepare the shipment.

The diamonds were placed
in a small porcelain doll.

This was Dante's down payment
into my father's operation.

The money was sealed in
plastic, put into an ice chest,

and then frozen.

Both the diamonds and cash
were going to be smuggled

out of the country the next
morning on my father's yacht.

The journey from Miami to the Bahamas

was my best chance to
escape and gain my freedom.

It was my intention to
have Rick ambush the boat

with some internal help.

I knew not all my father's men were happy

with Dante's move into his empire,

and I was going to strike my father

from the very walls that protected him.

One of his trusted men was
working with me, on the inside.

It was a simple, but dangerous proposal.

But if my plan worked, I would escape,

and escape with Rick, and the diamonds.

It was all on the line,
but it was all I had.

How are we looking?
Good.

Mr. Calivari's package is
all packed and ready to go.

Good man.

Is that gonna be ready to go?

In the morning, cold and hard.

I need to have a word with you.

[tense music]

Make sure it's frozen, solid.

What do you need, Boss?

We've got everything riding on this.

I need it taken care of right!

Jimmy, I'll never forget
all that you've done for me.

You know you can count on me.

"Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord."

Nothing increases evil more
than fighting evil with evil.

You can only fight evil with good.

Father. You're right.

I know this first-hand.

So tell me about your plan.

Did it work?


The plan went dreadfully wrong.

[tense music]

Everything's set. The
money's on the boat.

We'll be able to get on
the way in a few minutes.

Is everything going as planned?

Your package is secure.

And as for yours?

I guess you could say
our assets are frozen.

Everything is in its place.


Wherever I please.

Jacqueline!

I need some sun.

I think it would be best

if I made some things
clear to my daughter.

That would be good. When
will you be returning?

This sort of business only
takes a day, day and a half.

Have a good trip, then.

One that may begin the journey
of a great partnership.

[suspenseful music]
[boat engine revs]

[tense music]

We've moving at a good clip.

We should be in Grand
Bahamas by nightfall.

It's all out there.
The opportunity is now.

And with Calivari, we can make it happen.

I'll be below deck.

[suspenseful music]

[boar engine buzzes]

Watch it. That step's a doozy.

[gun fires]
[dramatic music]

[guns fire rapidly]

[guns fire rapidly]

[guns fire rapidly]

[guns fires rapidly]

[water splashes]

[gun fires]
[man screams]

[water splashes]

[gun fires]

Jimmy, Jimmy! Come on, we
get outta here, it's an ambush!

I know it's an ambush,
you idiot! Let's move!

[gun fires]

[gun fires]

Get away from the girl!

Go ahead. Make your move.

Drop the weapon, or the girl-

That is my daughter!


and drop your weapon, or the girl-

Do you really want to play the endgame?

[gun cocks]

You already lost, old man.

Give them the package.

Now!

[gun fires]
[dramatic music]

[water splashes]

[gun fires]

[water splashes]

The package! The package!

Stop them immediately!

[water splashes]

[water splashes]

What is the meaning of this?

We were ambushed!

How is that one man could
breach the security of four

and still escape with my package?

I was betrayed by a personal confidant.

One who dealt in my most intimate matters.

But he did not go after the money!

The money was frozen
solid in an ice chest.

His objective was clearly
the package and nothing more.

Check the money again.

It's all there.

I said check it again!

And what has become of this man?

He is dead.

Then where is my package?

Are you okay?

I don't know. How's your package?

Is this what I deserve?

My life, my freedom, my
citizenship is anything but free!

It comes at a price!

The fate of those who hold your package

will be the same as those
who have betrayed me.

[sullen orchestral music]

[elevator dings]
[suspenseful music]

[heartbeat thuds]

[gun cocks]

[lock clinks]

I was worried that you wouldn't come.

I always come.

[brooding orchestral music]

Are you okay?

We'll find out in a minute.

You wanna tell me why
I risked my life for her

when all I want is you?

[porcelain smashes]
[diamonds clink]

You got me.

You are here for one reason.

We have been attacked by betrayal.

And now we will defend.

Many questions remain!

[fly unzips]

But who is the lone gunman?

Well, I got a good look at this guy

when he got the shot off at me.

If it's who I think it is,
he works at a bar downtown.

I've got people in
every hotel, restaurant,

club and bar from Miami to Tampa.

If he's here, we'll find him.

Yeah, but I think I recognize this guy.

He works at a club downtown called Reno.

[ominous music]

In Overtown?

Yeah, that's the place.

Isn't that...

Yes.

It is.

Well, I think it's time
we pay them a little visit.

[urinal flushes]

Let's go.

[smooth jazz music]

way, cowboy. Fuck that shit.

[doors thud]
[glass smashes]

[door creaks]

Are you the normal bartender here?

There is nothin' normal about this bar.

I'm looking for the regular bartender.

A kid named Larson.
He's the man back here.

Well, I'm looking for the
guy who's normally here.

Oh, I'm sorry, Rick ain't here,

and I don't know what to tell ya.

That's the wrong answer, son!

[glass shatters]

Can I help you?

We have business to
conduct with your bartender.

You have business with these men?

Well, my business is managing a bar.

So you'll have to take yours elsewhere.

Let's go.

[door opens]

[phone rings]

Yeah, Larson. First name Rick.

I want the name on right now.

If this guy so much as takes a piss,

I wanna know what color it is.

[car starts]

We got a 6 AM flight
out of Fort Lauderdale,

and by 10, we're in town
with all this behind us.

Chicago. Feels like a dream.

Why is that?

Not having to live in fear.

I'm sorry, can you stop for a moment?

Something's not adding up.

If your fiance controlled
this vast criminal empire,

what would possibly make you
think you'd be safe in Chicago?

wasn't our final destination.

I had a contact there that
would change the diamonds

into cash and smuggle us out
of the country to Canada.

From there, we could go anywhere, but,

first we had to escape Florida.

[suspenseful music]

[car doors slam]

Good evening, sir. May I help you?

Yeah, you have a Rick
Larson staying here?

Uh, let me check, sir.

[keyboard clacks]

I'm sorry. There's no one
registered under than name.

They say he's not here.
What name is he under?

What?

You gotta be kidding me.

How about a Jacqueline Bombay?


[keyboard clacks]

[wine trickles]

Why'd you do this for me?

'Cause in life, there's
that one thing that drives us.

And you're it.

[door thuds]

[tense music]

[Jacqueline screams]

Let him go!
[gun cocks]

You're just like your mother!

What do you think this is? A game?

You're not gonna walk
away that easy, sister!

You wanna bet?

[gun fires rapidly]
[dramatic music]

[muffled yelling]
[guns fire rapidly]

Jacqueline, get out of here!

[gun fires]

[glass shatters]

Jacqueline, get out!
[gun fires rapidly]



[glass shatters]

Don't marry that man.

[gun fires]

[gun clicks]

[pipe clangs]

[water splashes]



[cuffs click]


[tires screech]
[engine roars]

Hey! My car!

[tires screech]

[dark music]

Lou! You better come
and take a look at this.

Get me Bombay.

[phone rings]

[phone rings]

[phone rings]

Do you have him?

Excellent.

You know where to take him.

What kind of a problem?

[Lou speaks foreign language]

[speaks foreign language].

This situation is very bad.

Your daughter's on the run.

She is working against you,

the wedding and the whole
operation with Dante Calivari.

She was behind the boat heist

and orchestrated the theft
of the Calivari diamonds.

Worst off, she has been plotting all this

right under our noses, working
against us from the start.

I feel that if she escapes,

it would jeopardize our
plans with the cartel.

The time to act is now, Jimmy.

I'll meet you at the rendezvous point.

[birds tweet]
[engines roar]

[suspenseful music]

We are going to have a little talk.

[tape tears]

Where is my fiance?

We can talk all night long,

but I'm never gonna say
what you wanna hear.

[tape tears]

This is not an
intellectual conversation.

This is where you end and I begin.

She ended you a long time ago.

Fuck you!

End comes to us all.

It is what we do in the face
of defeat that defines us.

Where are my diamonds?

I unloaded them for cash.

Impossible. You couldn't have.

Why is that?

Because when I found you, you smart ass,

you had no cash on you.

Yeah, but my girlfriend does.

[Dante grunts]

[bullet clacks]

[barrel clicks]

What is your name?

The name's Larson.

Rick Larson.

Tell me, Mr. Larson.

What do you know of a club called Reno?

That's the wrong question.

The answer is "what do you
wanna know about Club Reno?"

Rick Larson.

John Knight.

But the only name I really
need to hear is one.

Jack Black.

[brooding music]

No.

I offered it to him.

He didn't wanna know of it.
I don't believe you.

I'm telling you the truth.

You lie!

Jack Black plays the game,
but he wouldn't play you.

Why? I don't know.

What do you know of this man?

He's managed the Club
Reno for six years come June

and before that, he was in Glades for 14.

He likes to drink and play cards,

both of which he does on a nightly basis.

He has no friends and no family,

and when I offered him the job,

he threw a glass of bourbon at my head.

To me, that said a resounding no.

What did you say?

He said no.

What did he throw at your head?

Bourbon.

I want to know the truth.

Where is Jacqueline?

Gone.


Mr. Larson.

It is you who can articulate your fate.

Speak or face the music.

Let's dance.


[gasoline swashes]

[gasoline splashes]

My fate lies in this wedding!

He's gonna face the music!

Speak!

Speak! Speak, or you want to die?

[Rick coughs]

[Rick spits]

[Rick spits]

[gasoline splashes]

[Rick coughs]

[gasoline trickles]

My father will be in tomorrow.

If you cannot produce the girl,

then we will have to take
our business elsewhere.

[gasoline trickles]

[tense percussive music]

[flames hiss]

[explosion roars]
[ominous music]

[distant waves crash]

With the word of Rick's death,

I knew it was only time
before the endgame.

[ominous music]

Jacqueline must be found.

I think it would be best if
we ran the financial records.

Credit cards, bank accounts,
the whole spectrum.

Time is of the essence.
Calivari's coming undone.

What do we know about your girl?

She's got an airline
ticket and she's well-funded.

The question isn't if
she'll turn up, but when.

And who can bring her home.

I got a name for you, but
you're not gonna like it.

Jack Black.

Ace?

We need someone who's on
the other side of the coin,

and he's not behind it.

But he could undo it.

Why him?

Motivation.

That, she is.

Tell him an old debt will
be paid upon his arrival.

Make the call.

[clock ticks]
[distant waves crash]

[suspenseful music]

Checkmate.

I have a job for you.

One of a unique, personal interest.

I have no interest.

I'm here to get my money and leave.

I think you're gonna
have to take an interest.

I'm out of the game.

I'm not interested in making a comeback.

I've been out of the
can six years come June.

Haven't seen you in about 20.

There's no way I'm going out on the line.

Your daughter?

Yes, it's Jacqueline.

She's engaged.

That's lovely.

What am I doing here?

Her wedding is in three
days to Dante Calivari.

The Russian who's been
importing for me ever since-

The diamond cartel's man, so
why are you telling me this?

Things are very bad overseas.

It is paramount that Calivari
comes to this country

and weds Jacqueline.

No doubt you understand the implications.

If these two come together,

the game is not over.

There are moves still to be made.

Not by me. I risk my neck for nobody.

Jacqueline is missing.

[suspenseful music]

What do you mean she's missing?

She's run away.

Where?

Chicago.

What the hell is she doing there?

Avoiding holy matrimony.

Princess is a spoiled little brat.

This is business for Calivari.

Life and death.

He's wanted for a car bombing.

In Dublin.

You may have left the game,

but you still know all the players.

What do you want me to do?

You have three days.

You need to track Jacqueline down

and bring her back to this wedding.

Don't tell me what I need.

What I need and what you want
are very different things.

If you don't track her
down and bring her back here

in three days, then somebody
else is going to have to

bring her back in a much
less pleasant manner.

This isn't as easy as you think.

Don't underestimate her. She's smart.

She comes from good stock.

So how's, uh, Marilyn?

My wife is dead.

Six years, come June.

I'd like you to meet Lou Bishop.

This is an old friend of mine.

Ace.

Your reputation precedes you, Ace.


as those who pass them on.

And you can call me Jack.

Lou's one of my best.

For the right price, he'd do anyone.

Or anything.

Is that so?

I'm a businessman, Ace.


You take care of business your way,

and I'll take care of business my way.

Ace's business is in Chicago.

A family matter,

that I'm sure he would want
to take care of himself,

rather than anyone else.

Then let's finish these arrangements.

[distant plane engine hums]

[dramatic music]
[horn blares]

[phone rings]

Yeah, Jerry. Jerry Burton.

It's me, Jack Black.

Listen, I need a credit card run.

Right.

Bombay. Jacqueline.

Wait, wait, wait. Did
you make your contact?

Because obviously you became
a thief just like they are.

I mean, why are you here?

Do you want me to absolve you of this sin?

Is that what you want?


With Rick's death, our timeline changed.

My contact was out of
town until the next day.

So, I was stranded.

I knew Dante's father was
coming in for the wedding.

My time was running out.

Your time was running out.


Keep in touch from the
moment you get there.

No problem.

[water splashes]

[dark music]

See Jimmy Bombay. Now, bring him.

He's coming, Papa.

He's coming.

Dante Sr.

It's so good to see you.

Jimmy, if you would please take a seat.

Sit, sit.

Are your accommodations
to your specifications?

Everything is fine.

We need to speak.

It's very important to
me that my only son Dante

come to this country to
begin here a new life.

Because you provide this for me,

I have great gratitude
and appreciation for you.

But, where is this girl that
I'm soon to call my daughter?

I have to your home,
yet I have not met her.

And I want to know why.

[distant boat horn blows]

[tense music]

Seen this girl around anywhere?

Look familiar? No?

Excuse me, sir. Have you seen
this girl around anywhere?

I sure haven't, sir.

Are you sure she doesn't look familiar?

No, I haven't, sir.
You're sure?

No, sir. I haven't.

Does she look familiar to you?

You seen this girl by any
chance? She look familiar to you?

You seen this girl by any
chance? Look familiar to you?

Seen her around? No?

Look familiar?

[horn horns]

[faint dance music]

I like it.

I'll take it.

Yeah, it looks great on you!

[tense music]


[phone bleeps]

Hello?

What?

She used a credit card where?

What's the name of it?
Give me the address!

Oaken, Michigan. Got it!

Oaken, Michigan. Got it!

Oaken, Michigan!

Yes, sir!

I realize that your father
and Ace were close in the past.


But it seems strange that
your father would send Ace

to look for you and bring you back home.


I didn't even know that Ace existed.

But when Ace was working
the streets with my father,

he got very close to my mother as well.

Your mother. Tell me about her.

Were you close with her?

[suspenseful music]


were constantly in battle.

Mom was getting fed up
being the trophy wife to a

power-hungry coke dealer
who only wanted more power.

It wasn't always this way.

When they met, Mom had just stopped

a successful modeling career.

Dad promised her the
world, and for a while...

[glass shatters]
They had a great life.

At some point, she
wanted to start a family.

By then, Dad was barely
interested in Mom, let alone kids.

I think it was when things
with my father got really tough

that she turned to Ace.
[smooth jazz music]



Is it working?

I don't think it ever really works.

May I sit down?

You know, your face is a contradiction.

And why is that?

Your face is too pretty
to have eyes so sad.

Oaken, Michigan?

Oaken, Michigan, sir?

Oaken, Michigan, sir?

[faint dance music]

Have you seen this girl?

Why?

Well, she's my...

She's my... She's my daughter.

Came here to buy her a birthday present.

She was supposed to meet me
here. She's nowhere to be found.


I don't like being sorry.

That's your business.

You like business?

No. Pleasure.

Well, it would please me
if you could cut the shit.

Now, have you seen this girl or not?

Yeah.

About an hour ago.

She bought heels and a skirt,

then she went over to the
coffee shop across the street.

Thanks.
Hm.

Hey, I didn't know you were still here.

Someone's looking for you.

[dark music]

Jimmy, where is my fiance?

She's an emotional girl. You know that.

She just needed a little rest.
A little breather, that's it.

She'll be back.

I see it is in your best interest

to take control of your house!

Just remember whose
house you're standing in.

[Dante spits]

My daughter is going to
be a good wife to you.

You speak on behalf of
your daughter with arrogance,

but I do not share this
arrogant point of view!

I don't speak on behalf of anyone.

I speak for everyone.

And I'm sure you only want
what is best for Jacqueline.

And what is best for business.

[car horns blare]


[door creaks]



It's the right quality,
these are very nice.

What are you looking for?

[gun clacks]

[carrel clicks]

This will work.

[door creaks]
[faint country music]

[door creaks]
[bell rings]

[door closes]

What can I do for ya?

Oh, I seem to have lost
something and the problem is,

I can't seem to find it.

What're you drinkin'?
Bourbon.

You know, a man can
get killed doing that.

Drinking bourbon?

Looking for girls.

So what does she look like?


What?

Now, some guy was in
here looking for some girl

with the same description.

"Tall and dark hair, long legs."

Who? What're you talkin' about?

Was it the same girl?

Listen, buddy.

Guys like you come in here,

looking for girls like that, every day.

I ain't seen your
girlfriend, hooker or wife.

Daughter.

I ain't seen her, either.

[bell rings]

[traffic hums]

[faint blues rock music]

Checking in, sir?

The name's Black. Jack Black.

And are you traveling alone?

I find that's the only way to travel.

And how long will
you be staying with us?

No more than two nights.

Okay. We'll need a major credit card.

How much would you be
putting on that card?

Excuse me?

I said how much would you be
putting on that credit card?

Well, your room is 569 a night.

Plus expenses.

I don't use credit cards,

because, frankly, I don't
think anybody should know

exactly where you are at
every minute of the day.

[horns blare]

[phone rings]

[phone rings]

Yeah.

How are you doin'?

Gettin' close.

[suspenseful music]
[heartbeat thuds]

Where are you?

Coming from the north side.

Time's running out.

I hope you don't, too.

I'm not worried.

Keep in touch!

[phone bleeps]

[brooding music]

What if you blew off your next heist,

and we could take off together?

I don't think your husband
would like traveling in threes.

You know I can't take much
more of this. I need you.

His temper is going to kill me.

You only need one last score.

[cork pops]

Make this one it.

Bet on me.

How do you know what I need?

Because I give it to you.

I'll give it all up for
you, baby, but not now.

When?

This is it. One for the road.

And then it's just you and me.

Are my cuff links still on that shirt?

No.

Good. Then keep it.

Are you gonna be okay here tonight?

Yeah. He won't be back
until the morning anyway.


[door opens]

[switch clicks]

[door closes]

[ominous tones]

[lighter flicks]

In life, there are games of luck,

and there are games of skill.

But the greatest skill of all

is having a lifelong supply of luck.

The problem is, I knew
mine was about to run out.

[horns honk]
[traffic hums]

[door opens]

[switch clicks]

[door closes]

[brooding music]

What if I were to make
you a deal, Jack Black?

[gun cocks]


Hello, Jacqueline.

And you can call me Ace.


So how did you know my name?

The same way I got in your room.

I work for no one.

Room service, please.

But I was hired by Jimmy Bombay.


Well, think about when
you first got engaged,

and ask yourself why you did that.

Because I like money, but...

Hello? Yes, I'd like to
a bottle of Dom Perignon.

Room num...

Right, thank you.

[phone clacks]

Money's useless, if you're
not alive to spend it.

Do you think I'm about to die?

I don't think you've begun to live.

And what if I were to
make you a proposition?

Usually, I'm on the other
side of that question mark.

I have one chance to get
away from my father and Dante,

and since this marriage
is till death do us part,

here is the play I need.

You want me to kill you?

Or so it will appear.

Not interested.

What are you doing?
Calling your father.

No, please don't call my dad!

Sorry.

I'll kill myself.

[phone rings]

In life, there are
players and there are pawns.

It's up to you how you play the game.

[phone rings]
[suspenseful music]

[phone rings]

[phone bleeps]

I have money! Name your
price and it's yours.

Jimmy, I got her.

Where?

I got her in my room right now.

[gun cocks]

Uh...

I gotta go.

I gotta go. I'll call you back later.

I'll call you back.

What's this?

Me making my move.

You don't understand. I'm
a prisoner of my mistakes.

But I know you can do this.

Son of a gun. He pulled it off.

You know who Jimmy Bombay is?

The score is easily mid to
upper-level seven digits.

It sets the table for her
to make a permanent move.

Name your price and it's yours.

As I said, money is useless,

if you're not alive to spend it.

We all die, but how many
of us can say we truly lived?

Look, why don't you put that gun away

before you hurt yourself?

Frankly, your money and your
problems don't interest me.

Do I?

[Jack chuckles]

You know, he raped me.

My fiance?

He raped me.

Or did my father forget to tell you that?

Your father indicated
that you had a chance

to say yes or no, and you said yes.

At first he was a nice
guy who treated me right.

You mean, he spent money on you.

Yeah, that too. So
why wouldn't I say yes?

And then suddenly he raped you?

We were in London when
Dad went to business

and we went out with a
couple of his friends.

I had a little too much
to drink that night and...

I ended up in his hotel room,

where he asked me to go
down on one of his friends,

and when I wouldn't do
it, Dante got furious.


But I wouldn't do it.

So Dante took out his revolver

and he raped me with it. [sobs]

Did Jimmy know about this?

I was hospitalized for a week

and I couldn't walk for three more.

Get your things together
and leave right now!

I can't help you, but
I won't come after you!

Do you think my dad
would ever let that happen?

Oh, I don't think you'll have
to worry about your father.

What's that?

I ordered champagne.

[suspenseful music]

Did somebody order champagne?

[gun cocks]

Mr. Bombay is grateful for your services,

but you're no longer needed.

Get away from me!

[phone rings]

[phone rings]

Get your hands off me!

Jimmy! What the hell is going on here?

Checkmate!

Sometimes when all the
pieces are lined up,

the only thing left to
do is to make your move.

I had to make sure that my
little princess would get home.

You used me!

I used your move against
you. That's the game!

[Jacqueline yelps]


[phone bleeps]

[tense music]

Get your hands off me! [whines]

Get your hands off of her,

or I'll spray your brains across the wall!

Do you understand me perfectly?

She's coming home with me!

I'm not going anywhere without Ace!

[car starts]

[car door opens]

[tires screech]

[suspenseful music]



Get inside and go upstairs!

You are gettin' married in the morning.

Did she have it on her?

When I found her, she didn't
have much of anything on her.

She's clean.

The son of a bitch flushed it.

[ominous music]

[lock clicks]

[water splashes]

[dramatic music]

I go in hard with a bang.

I'll keep the sheep at bay
while you take the vault.

I'll clean out the vault below

and blow the locks off the safe.

If it doesn't blow, I'll hand off to you,

and you clean out the rest
of the cash in the vault.

If the safe doesn't
blow, it's not worth it.

We'd be vulnerable at the hand-off.

The pendulum could swing right there.

I mean, is this really worth it?

What are you thinking?

You know this is the right move!

It's not a move, it's a gamble.

But sometimes you have to stack 'em up,

push 'em in and roll the dice.

400,000. We have 400,000.

We're looking for 400,000.

Ah, I have 400,000. Can we get 410,000?

410,000. We have 410,000.

Looking for 420,000. 420,000.

Do we have 420?


I'm here to make a bid on an item.

I was wondering if you
could take a look at this

and tell me if I'm in the right place.


[guns fire]

[yells indistinctly]

[guns fire rapidly]

Get on the floor! Get on the floor!


Get me into that safe! Get
me into that safe, now!

Open that safe, now! Now!

Move!


[keys clink]


Just get me in the vault!


[tense music]


Put your hands on your
head before I blow it off!

Jimmy, I don't got a
combination for the small one.



[match strikes]

[fuse crackles]

It's gonna blow! Move back, back!

[fuse crackles]

[explosion booms]

The safe didn't blow!

Hand-off! Get down there!

Down! Get down!

[indistinct yelling]

[door closes]

[ominous tones]

[door opens]

Don't make another move!

[brooding music]


I've always known,

and I'll always love you.

There's a package waiting
for you in Chicago.

[somber music]
[water swashes]

You look beautiful.

You know I love you.

You may be angry with me now,

but Dante Calivari is what
a girl like you needs.

Your mother would be very proud of you.

But even she and I were very different.

So much pain.

After everything I've done for you,

from the cradle to the grave!


There's a price! There's a
price for the life you live.

How much are you willing to pay?

I'll leave you two alone.

You will love me.

you, Dante. Never love you.

You will love me!
[Jacqueline groans]

money! You can take my life!

But you will never have my love!



You will love me!

If your mother could see you now.

You look beautiful.

I need your help.

I already have.


on the pier that morning.

He was the only one left that
could've helped me escape

this horrific marriage and
he did not let me down.

Why do you think he decided to help you

in your time of need?

this was more than business.

More than diamonds or money.
More than wealth or power.

He had a score to settle
and a promise to fulfill.

[peaceful string music]
[waves crash]

I'm glad you're here for this.

Regardless of our past.

[ominous music]
[waves crash]

[waves crash]

[gun fires]

What do you think you're doing?

[drowned out by gunfire] or
I'll spray you all with blood!

What do you think you're doing?

Making my move.

Drop the gun or we'll end you!

I know you won't hurt a
hair on her head! You can't!

20 years ago, you had sex with my wife,

and then got thrown in jail
and this how you repay me?

I raised her as if she was my own!

What?

And how did that job go wrong, Jimmy?

How did I end up in jail?

'Cause nobody fucks my wife!

[dramatic music]

[gun fires]

[bullets ricochet]
[guns fire]


Stop her!

[Jacqueline squeals]

There!

This is how you conduct
your business, Ace?

Drop the gun or your daughter dies.

[gun fires]

This is how I conduct my business!

[gun fires]

So!
Dad!

This is endgame.

Go ahead! Make your move!

Why did you do this to me now?

If not now, when?

Funny. My wife used to
say that all the time.

When did I get out of
jail, Jimmy? Tell her!

Six years.

Come June 20th.

The day Mom died.

Checkmate, old partner!

She knows!

Jacqueline, you are
just like your mother!

[Jacqueline yelps]

[gun fires]

[gun fires]

[somber music]
[Jacqueline whines]

I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you.

You never hurt me!

I didn't wanna get close to anyone.

So I wouldn't be hurt by anybody.

But you were worth...


[Jacqueline sobs]

Help me! [screams]

Help!

Somebody help me!

Are you okay?

Stay back! Get away from me!

Now you need me as much as I need you!

But at least I love you! Can you?

I do.

[gun fires]

[waves crash]

[somber music]
[waves crash]

So, you did it.

You cut down your enemies and you escaped.

You survived.

But now? Now it's time
to resume your life.

And believe this. God
understands and forgives you.

This I do know.

But before you leave, there's
something I... [chuckles]

I'm sorry, but I must know this.

What happened to the diamonds?
[suspenseful music]

I'm just, I'm just curious.

You still there?


No, of course not.

Yeah.

God bless you, child.

[horns honk]
[traffic hums]

Checking in, miss?

The name is Black.

Jackie Black.

Oh, yes. You have a package
waiting for you in your suite.

[brooding music]

She deserves her freedom.

And they deserved their fate.

God takes vengeance on
those who perpetuate sin.

So you go in peace, my child.

And may you find your redemption.

Wherever that may be.
