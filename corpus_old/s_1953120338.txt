Turn over to the right.

You're squinting. Don't look
into the sun. Look at the camera.

Okay, run your fingers
through your hair.

Open your eyes, wide open.

One hand on your hip.

And smile.

Well, we are finished here.
These will be great.

Thank you, Bunny.
Well, go have fun with your boyfriend.

He's waiting so patiently.

So Armond, what'd you think?
Beautiful as ever.

So you can spend
a few more days here?

No, you know
I have to get back to work.

Well, we'll just have to make
the most of the time we have.

Maybe I'll come back some day.

Hello, Irving.
Good afternoon, Bettie.

How was your trip?
It was fabulous,

but you know
I always miss New York.

Well, you're too late today,
so you'll have to come back tomorrow.

How was your week?

Weeks are better
when I put out pictures of you.

Stop joshing me.
See you tomorrow.

Chop chop.
Time is money.

I'm ready if Paula is.

Bettie, are you ready?

I am, Irving, but can we please
have some music?

There's no time for that.
We are ready to shoot.

I'm ready!

All right, action!

And cut.
Okay, we're done.

Everybody, same time,
same place, tomorrow.

Irving? Irving?

Do you mind if I get paid now
instead of the end of the week?

If I give you an advance, can you do
some other shoots tomorrow?

I've been getting
some special requests.

Sure, I'll be there.

Thank you.

You look so pretty with your tan.
Thank you.

Do you think I can go to Florida
with you next time?

Maybe, if you're nice.
I'll be nice.

Oh, I see how nice you are.

So, Marvin,

what do you say
that we study our script

for tomorrow's audition?

All right.
Okay?

Yeah.
All right.

I'll be back.

Okay, one for you.

All right, let's go.

You know how I feel about you,

with your raven hair
and bronze skin.

But you know we cannot marry.

Father would never hear of it.

He has promised me to another.

Run away with me.

Sometimes I... I don't think

you even see us as a couple.

I do.

I picture us happy...

in our home...

with the white picket fence,

two kids and a dog.

I do think that way about us.

You mean the world to me.

I see you in my dreams
every night,

but then Father and Mr. Reynolds
come and take me away from you.

Run away with me.

Okay.

So I think we did pretty good.
Yeah.

I hope I get the part tomorrow.

You're gonna get
bigger roles than that.

Look how popular your pictures are.

I know,
but I wanna be an actress.

You will.

You will.
Thank you for having faith in me.

So how do you like
the new spurs?

I like them.

What are we doing today?
You're tying the ropes.

Your hair looks great.
Come on, let's go.

Come on Bettie, let's go.

Jack, we are all set.

Bettie, why don't you spank her
with the hairbrush?

Great, Bettie.
How about some stills?

Beautiful.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, how about one more?

Perfect.
Great.

Nice job.
Thank you.

Why don't you go get changed?
And Jack, why don't you pack up?

We'll go meet Irving
and get something to eat.

Thank you.
Yeah.

Yeah, should be fine.
I think it will be too.

Okay.

Okay, Irving, what are they saying
about "Teaserama"?

Well, let's see.

"'Teaserama' stars stripper
Tempest Storm.

Other girls include
Chris LaChris,

Twinnie Wallen, Vicki Lynn,

Cherrie Knight,
and Trudy Wayne.

Bettie Page as the showcard girl
is underrated.

She has the beauty, the build,
and the presence to steal my heart.

Her expressions are classic,

and she's more amazing in motion
than she is in her stills.

Miss Storm is one of the biggest
tease artists of all time.

You can see
why she is such a delight.

However, Miss Page steals
the scene as Miss Storm's maid."

Wow.

And here's some more
about you, Bettie.

"'Teaserama' is the biggest
burlesque film ever.

The sexy Tennessee tease
Miss Bettie Page

terms up with that hurricane of delight,
Miss Tempest Storm

in a boudoir bit
that scorches the screen.

I'm convinced that there will never
be another like Bettie.

Forget the comics.
They're awful.

And enjoy the ladies. Bettie Page
completely outshines the rest."

Bettie.
Y'all have very big imaginations.

Hey, listen to this.

"I was pleasantly surprised

by the fresh, sexy,
and flirtatious 'Teaserama.'

Miss Page always seems
to be having a good time...

the most attractive
and alluring woman ever."

Here, and what about this one?

"With her girl-next-door smile
and hourglass figure,

Bettie Page performs
two stylized dance numbers.

As a favorite
photographer's model

and a girlie film cutie,
she isn't a real stripper,

but rather a lovely 'come-on girl."'

Bettie, you're a star.

Irving, you're being silly.

Let's just enjoy our dinner.

Could you pass me
the water, Irving?

Yeah, sure.
Want some wine, sweetie?

Yeah, I'll have some wine.
Here you go, Bettie.

Hello? Irving.

Yes.

So you saw Bettie in a magazine.

Yes.

Well, how can I help you?

Screen test?

Hollywood?

For Howard Hughes?

I think she would love
to do a screen test.

The number is Greenwich-543...

Hello, Miss Page.
I hope your flight was a pleasant one.

It was, thank you.
Well, good.

Right this way, then.
Okay, thank you.

Here are some costumes to try on.
Pick whatever you like.

Okay. Thank you.

Come in.

Mr. Hughes, Miss Page
is changing right now.

Thank you, Jimmy.
That'll be all for now.

Okay, just tell us about yourself.

Okay. Hey there,
my name is Bettie Page.

I am 5'5" tall.

I have black hair and blue eyes.

I live in New York City.

I'm originally from Tennessee.

I was the second runner-up

in the Miss New York Pageant in 1951,

and uh...

I guess that's it.
Thank you.

Great. Thanks.
We're done here.

Well, thank you.
So do I meet Mr. Hughes now?

We thank you very much for your time,
but Mr. Hughes has left for the day.

Okay, did you want me
to come back tomorrow?

Actually, we're done.
So you can change,

and have a safe flight
back to New York.

Thank you.

Run away with me.

Sometimes, I wonder if you ever
see us as a couple...

together, happy,

in our home...

with a white-picket fence,

two kids and a dog.

I do see us that way.

I think about you
every night in my dreams

and it's wonderful,

but then it turns
into a nightmare

when Mr. Reynolds and my father
come and take me away from you.

Run away with me.

You all right, Bettie?

Irving had me do
the strangest thing today.

He had me down on all fours,

with this leather harness
on my head.

You couldn't even tell it was me.

You know, I wish you didn't
even do the bondage stuff.

Marvin, you know I have
to do the bondage.

I don't get paid if I don't do it.

I don't get hurt and it pays
twice as much as the regular stuff.

Yeah, I know,
but I mean, maybe...

maybe that's why Howard Hughes
never called you back.

I thought we agreed
not to talk about my trip to L.A.

I'm sorry.
It's okay.

It's just... I wanna be
an actress, Marvin.

I'm not getting anywhere.

All right, you know what?
Why don't we skip the review?

Who cares what a bunch
of stupid critics think, anyway?

What matters is
that you and I had fun.

No, I wanna hear it.

All right.

"The dry drama
'Lovers Down the Lane'

starring Mr. Marvin Greene
and Miss Bettie Page,

will pass
with no more notice than this.

While Mr. Greene's
performance is adequate,

Miss Page attempts to play
a Boston socialite

with a Tennessee accent.

This pin-up model
ought to leave her clothes at home."

I can't believe this.
I'm going home.

Bettie. Bettie.

All right, Peggy, you're all set.

Bettie?

Do I pass muster?

Well, you will
with one more pair of panties.

One more? I've already got two.
You know I can't have any hair visible

down there.
All right,

give me a minute.

Paula, are you ready?
As ready as I'll ever be.

The cameras
are all set up and loaded.

All right, everyone, let's go.

That was great, ladies.

We have time for one more.

Okay.
Okay.

Does my hair look all right?

Looks good, let's go.

Bettie, we have a session
next week in the woods.

Are you interested?
Sure.

Good.

So, wanna go meet
those other photographers later?

Is that tonight?
Yes.

Sure, just let me get changed.

Good evening, ladies.
So nice you could join us.

Good. Hello.
Hi there.

Hello.
Can I...

get you something to drink?

Sure.
How about for you?

I would love a root beer.
A root beer?

Oh, that can't be right.
Let me make you something stronger.

Cigarette?
Thanks.

Nah, I don't smoke,
thank you.

Just use the glass as a prop.
You don't have to drink it.

Well, you boys are so cute.
I guess it would be okay.

Well, what do you say?

Wanna take some pictures, I guess?
Mm-hmm.

Oh, that's very nice.

You look very friendly.
Just one little sip?

For me?

Oh, see?

Cheers.
This is her first time.

Why don't you two get friendly?

Very nice.

Okay.

Peggy.

Turn around.

It's hot in here, isn't it?

Button button,
who's got the button?

How many buttons do you got?
One.

One.

Two.

Two.

Three.
Give me three.

Are my two Janes ready?
Ready as I'll ever be.

Ready as can be.
Love the bikini, Bettie.

Thank you, I made it myself.

Cut.

Jeanne, take that gag
out of her mouth.

Are you all right?
Do you need a minute?

Yes, please.

All right, let's get the stills done
so we can get her down from there.

Okay, Jeanne, try spanking her.

Great.

Uh, one more.

Great.

That should do it.

Hi, we're with the FBI.
I'm Agent Burke.

This is Agent Swanson.
What's this all about?

We need to ask you some questions
about Irving Klaw.

Irving's done nothing wrong.
And how do you explain these?

These pictures were taken
by some camera club photographers.

Irving didn't even take those pictures.

Here's a subpoena.
You can explain that all in court.

Ma'am.

Pin-up king Irving Klaw
was summoned to testify

before the Senate Obscenity
Investigation Committee Thursday.

Tennessee Senator
Estes Kefauver accused Klaw

of distributing pornography,
contributing

to the delinquency of minors.
Ladies and gentlemen,

I call this

the worst pornography

of any kind!

Mr. Klaw sells
fetish, bondage, whipping

and torture photographs of women
from his downtown New York shop.

According to Kefauver, the photos
are obscene by any reasonable standard.

Because in any other words,

these images are obscene.

These images are immoral

in any standard we hold

in this country.

When questioned about the
12-year-old girls on his mailing list,

Klaw claimed they only request
photographs of movie stars,

like Jimmy Stewart or Doris Day.

I assure you that these
are for movie star stills only.

They are not cross-referenced
with our other customers.

Klaw denied
selling nude photographs,

insisting that he frequently
made his models

wear multiple articles
of the same type of clothing.

In the entire history of my company
Movie Star News,

neither myself
nor my sister Paula Klaw

have produced, advertised
or distributed

any photos
containing nude models.

Earlier, Dr. William Olson,
a psychiatrist,

testified that Mr. Klaw's
cartoon and model parade catalogue

intends to stimulate people erotically
in an abnormal way.

Mr. Kefauver summed up the day's
proceedings saying to Mr. Klaw,

"Your products fall into
a twilight zone of obscene material."

You're still here?

Pardon me.
I'm here to testify.

They all left hours ago.

It's 1:00 in the morning.

I wish somebody would've
told me something.

Come with me. I will unlock the door
so you can go home.

How are you doing, Irving?

Are we gonna start
shooting again?

Bettie, I'm not going
to be shooting

any more pictures or movies.

Well, you're cleared
of all charges.

Why not?
I'm just too tired.

I'm really sorry, Bettie.

Good luck.

Well, thank you for everything.

You too, sweetheart.

Okay. Take care.

Okay.

Bye.

Oh, God!

Hi, operator?
May I have the police, please?

Thank you.

Last time.
Just stand here,

we will go that direction, and we
will be watching you the entire time.

Okay.
Do you have any questions?

No.
No, I think I got it.

Great. Let's get into position.

We'll be at your side the moment
someone goes for the package.

Okay. Okay, I'm ready.
Okay.

Oh, God.

Hi, yes, operator?
Yeah, Miami Beach,

50-432.

Okay, thank you.

Hello?
Armond?

Hi, it's Bettie.
Hey, Bettie.

How are you?
Fantastic. I've thought of you.

Well, I've been thinking of you too.

What about your boyfriend?
Is he there?

No, I'm not seeing him anymore.

I miss you.

I miss you too.

So how is New York?

Well, actually I was thinking
about making a trip to Miami.

I just wanted to make sure
you were there.

You wanna move to Miami?

Move to Florida?
Yeah, right.

Where would I live?

You can live here.
I've got a pretty big place.

I can't live with you,
not unless we get married.

We could always get married.

Well, we would have to get
reacquainted first.

Yes, I know.

Okay, we'll talk about it
when I get there.

Okay.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

Okay, okay.

I'll see you soon.
Have a safe trip, all right?

All right.
Okay?

Okay, I'll see you soon.

Bye, Armond.
Bye.

Armond,
it's New Year's Eve.

Can't we go out dancing?

We don't ever do anything.

What do you want me to do?

Look, all you care about
is eating hamburgers,

watching movies and having sex.

At least I'm satisfied
with what I have.

You know, we've been married five weeks
and I'm already regretting this.

I am bored to tears.
