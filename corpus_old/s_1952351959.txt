Gimme that old-time religion

It's good enough for me

Gimme that old-time religion

It's good enough for me

It was good
for the Hebrew children

And it's good enough for me

Gimme that old-time religion

It's good enough for me

Gimme that old-time religion

It's good enough for me

It will do when the world's on fire

And it's good enough for me

Gimme that old-time religion

It's good enough for me

Gimme that old-time religion

It's good enough for me

Gimme that old-time religion

It's good enough

For me

Yeah, for me

No gay marriage!

No gay marriage!
No gay marriage!

No gay marriage!

PAsTOR: Activist judges
and pandering legislatures

are bent on destroying
the institution of marriage

as being between one man
and one woman.

We must rise up as one voice
and proclaim,

"No! No same-sex marriage!"

No gay marriage!

No gay marriage!
No gay marriage!

No gay marriage!

Now, about the rapture -

we know it's comin'.

It's just a matter of how soon.

The answer, of course,

is in His hands...

Honey, slow down.
You're gonna trip.

Well, I want to get back
to the rally, hon.

Okay, okay. Well, just
put 'em down in the booth,

and Lucy and I
will take care of the rest.

All right.

...to be well-nourished
while we're waiting for him

to call us on up
to our everlasting reward.

so, till that time arrives...

Folks got to eat, right?

Meantime, while we're waitin',

why not try cookin' up
some of these?

They call for ingredients
that were already around

when the Bible
was first set down on paper.

Well, thank you kindly, Miss...

Bliss. Miranda Bliss.

And this here is my sister,
Lucy Dexter -

my partner,
Chief of Recipe Development,

and all-around inspiration.

Y'all keep us in mind
for your special caterin' needs.

Next time you're having a party
or some event

that's a little too big to handle
all by your lonesome,

just remember:

We're Fishes & Loaves
Christian Caterin'.

I will, ladies. I surely will.
Okay.

Take care, now.
Bye, now.

Oh, so precious.
I know.

Gotcha!
Aah!

Tom Dexter, when are
you ever gonna grow up?

Lucy, honey, is now a good time?

Yeah, ready in a sec, hon.

That's the baby lady
I was tellin' you about.

I promised her
we'd come on over and visit.

Okay.
All right.

Miranda?
Yeah.

I'll be there in a minute.

You know, it's been five years
since our weddin'

and still no luck.

Well, not for lack of tryin'.
Ain't that right, sweetie?

Tom, I don't think Miss Dawson
needs to hear -

DEBBIE sUE: Oh, now, Lucy.

Far as I know, the good Lord's not
opposed to that kind of passion,

expressed within the boundaries
of a good marriage, of course.

I like the way you put that,
Miss Dawson.

so, Debbie sue,

we want to know
all about Destiny's Children.

Well, you two may know

that when a couple goes in
for a fertility procedure,

they make a lot more eggs
than needed.

I've heard that.

But they freeze the extras anyway,
just in case.

But then sometimes, at the end,
all those extras

just wind up gettin' defrosted
and thrown away,

or, worse, they're donated
to stem-cell research.

It is our mission here
at Destiny's Children

to rescue as many of those
young, preborn lives as we can,

and then we make them available
to qualified childless couples.

Tom?

I - I think this is exactly
what we're looking for.

I think our prayers
have been answered.

Praise the Lord.

Oh, the blood ofJesus

It washes white as snow

I- I can't. I'm sorry.

It washes white as snow

so, Lucy and Tom -
They're goin' ahead with it.

The embryo adoption.

That Destiny's Children
organization

that was at the fair
in the booth next to us.

so - so what do you think?

About what?

Well, a-adoptin' an embryo.

Well, seems like
a right good idea...

For them.

Lord knows how hard
they've been tryin'...

the normal way.

What about us, Parker?

What about us?

You know what I'm talkin' about.

Parker Bliss sr.,

it has been five years
since the Lord took Parker Jr.

to sit next to him up in heaven,
and ever since then

you've managed to freeze me out
of most of your life.

Miranda, I got no time for this now!
Parker!

It's not for us
to understand His reasons.

But the Lord, He...

He wants for us
to go on with our lives.

Honestly, Tom,
it's just a home visit

before the final approval
of our embryo.

I just want to make sure

that Debbie sue gets
the right impression.

Oh, that must be her.
Can you get the door?

I'll be along in a minute.

All right. You just make up
your mind and come on out.

Don't you dare start fussin'
over which cologne.

You smell just fine
the way you are.

Her highest rating.

Yes.

But, Tom, why'd you have to be
so all-fired friendly?

Heck, honey,
I'm a friendly guy.

Ain't I?

Well... Hey, now.

I don't know.
Come on.

Now, friendly - my friendly's
for near about everybody.

Mm.

But love -

It's for you
and you alone, sweet pea.

And who's to say they'll stop
at same sex once they get that?

What's next?

"Well, I love my dog.

Great. I'll marry him. Or her. "

And how about our fine,
feathered, flying friends?

"Well, say, uh, my parrot and I,
we share great conversation.

We see eye to eye
on a great many things.

Great. I'll marry my bird"

Can you seejust where
all of this is leading us?

Here at Bunker Hill Community
Children's Hospital in Boston,

Dr. Sanford Price-Owens,
known as Sandy to his colleagues

and heartbreakingly
young patients alike,

has had the first real breakthrough
in a decade or more

in the treatment
ofDietrich-Schygulla Syndrome,

or D.S. for short.

Dr. Price-Owens reports
that he's made good use

of two stem-cell lines made
available to him late last year

from a research lab in Helsinki
in his quest for a treatment

designed to prolong the lives
ofD.S. kids,

who, until recently,
have rarely lived into their teens.

I was lucky to be invited
to a festive lunch

at the beautiful home Dr. P.O. shares
with noted dance choreographer

and costume designer
Terry Price-Owens,

where the very hospitable
Terry reminded me -

more than once, in fact-
that he and the doctor

were the 17th gay couple
to be married in 2004,

following legalization
ofsame-sex marriage

in the Bay State.

And it should come
as no surprise to our viewers

that Sandy and Terry Price-Owens

are eager to start a family
of their own.

Well, Monica, ofcourse we
initially considered adoption,

but we decided
to be on the lookout

for an open-minded
young woman

who'd be willing
to be a surrogate mom

and have a biological child for us.

It was Kathy, who was
the ratherAmazon-like woman

who was at our luncheon -

She has agreed to give us

a ripe and ready stash ofeggs
from her own batch,

but she's also made it
perfectly clear

that she does not want to be
pregnant for us.

So, for- for us -
for Sandy and me -

the search is on.

So if there are
any young ladies out there

who would be willing
to help us...

make our dream come true,
it would be appreciated.

And thank you.

Oh, lead me, Lord

Oh, please show me Your way

Guide me to the righteous path

And I will never stray

Oh, guide me, Lord

For I am lost

Please see me
through this night

Let me know
the straight and true

Oh, let me see the light

Oh, lead me, Lord

Shine down upon my face

Let Your wisdom
and Your love

Return me to Your grace

Hallelujah!

Okay.

Okay.

Dr. Price-Owens,

you don't know me,

but I saw the documentary
about your work on TV.

Five years ago,

we lost our son
to Dietrich-Schygulla syndrome.

When I saw you in your home
with your partner,

the other Mr. Price-Owens, on TV

and heard what you two are
seeking in your own lives,

I prayed hard on it,

and after not that long a time,
actually,

the Lord answered me.

And while I was more
than a little surprised...

"... The Lord
was pretty specific

that it's okay for me to try
and help you gentlemen

to carry your child for you,
if that's what you want. "

Of course it's what we want.

"For the time being, anyway,
I have put aside my concerns

that you and
the other Mr. Price-Owens

are what I, up to now,
have long believed

to be godless, atheistic sodomites. "

"The Lord has assured me
we can work all that out later. "

Probably in the afterlife.

"so, I write you now
to offer my services,

and, of course,
I wouldn't expect any payment.

Dr. Price-Owens,
you just keep helping

those D.s. syndrome children,

and with the Lord's assistance,

I'll try to help you
and the other Mr. Price-Owens

with what you seek.

Please e-mail me back
if interested.

Yours truly,
Mrs. Miranda Parker -"

I'm out of my mind -
"Bliss sr. "

No, no. Wait. Wait.
Wait, there's more.

"P.s.
I am not a crazy person.

This offer is sincere,

and my uterus is in good
and working order, as far as I know. "

Well, honey, so is mine.

"I want to help. Truly. "

so what do you think?

Later?

What?

Later!

Sandy!

Sandy, it's not like
we're swamped with offers here.

I know. I know. But...

Our documentary ran
for six months -

six months -
in reruns on late-night cable.

I mean, let's face it.
Miranda's all we've got.

I am still not sure.

This is someone who got
a dispensation from you-know-who

saying that you and I
are temporarily suspended

from being abominations
before God.

Well, yes.

I- I admit that's a potential hurdle.

What if she changes her mind?

What if she gets another message,
like, week 34?

Sandy... This is our last shot.

I say we go for it.

Fine.

Fine?

Fine.

Dear Mrs. Bliss.
Terry Price-Owens here.

Sandy and I are just thrilled.

We'd love to have you come to Boston
at your earliest convenience.

We'll pay for the flight, of course,

and you can meet us
up close and personal,

and see what you're
getting yourself into.

There's not a friend
like the lowly Jesus

No, not one

None else could heal
all our souls'diseases

Parker?

I have the most wonderful news.

What's that, hon?

I...

Oh.

We can talk about it later.

All right.

No, not one

You what?!
Have you lost your mind?!

I'm telling you, the Lord wants me
to have a baby for these men.

Don't ask me to understand it,
'cause I don't -

not completely anyway -
but He spoke to me, okay?

And His words
were loud and clear.

Oh, and I'm sure Parker's
just fine with this.

Well, this isn't exactly something
I can share with him right now.

Uh-huh.

He's a little too wrapped up

in his "one man, one woman,
one marriage" activities just now

to comprehend
what I'm about to do.

Well, yeah, speakin' of which,

how is your own
"one man, one woman" marriage

doin' these days?

Well, we're workin' on it.

As in?

We're - we're not quite
at that stage yet.

Well, I don't get it.

Oh, honey, he -
he can't stop blamin' himself

for Parker Jr.
getting called to heaven,

and no matter
how many doctors tell him

that D.s. isn't genetic,

he just refuses to hear it.

Do you remember how much fun
he used to be?

Oh, right.

He'd write you
all those love poems.

There was that one

where the last word of every line
had to rhyme with...

Miranda.

Now, that Parker Bliss sr.
I know is in there somewhere,

and not a day goes by
that I don't pray to the Lord

to find him and send him
right on back to me.

sure, when you're not busy praying

on how you can lend a hand
to those homosexual gentlemen

with their -
their family planning issues.

When the Lord calls my name

When you comin' home
from Boston?

Tonight, I expect.

It's gonna be tight, but I aim
to give Parker his supper.

Nothin' to upset our routine
till this thing is... Arranged.

There'll be no cause for shame

Now, remember -
mum's the word with Parker.

All right. Go with God, sis.

Wherever He takes me.

Bye.
Bye.

I will fly like an angel
to the Lord

I will fly

I will fly like an angel
to the Lord

Knock, knock.

Who's there?

Oliver.

Oliver who?

"All over" my body
the mosquitoes are biting me.

Knock, knock.

Who's there?

spinach.

spinach who?

"It's been itchin'"
so long I got to scratch it!

Ah. Here we are.

That's him.
That is my son, Parker Jr.

Five years gone.

Well, it's for kids like your boy
I do what I do, you know.

I do. I-I truly do.

And the Lord, He knows it, too.

I'm sure He does.

Make sure and hold on
to the handrail.

I was walkin' up these stairs
with a friend of mine the other day,

showing him the upstairs, and -
whoops - all the way down.

It was a mess.

This is Sandy's Old Zayde.
He was a urologist in Minsk.

Actually, he was a shoemaker, but
I like thinking of him as a urologist.

I mean, he looks like a doctor,
doesn't he?

I mean, his eyes
are sort of piercing

and compassionate and caring,
like a doctor should be.

Miranda.

Miranda?

I know what you're thinking.

I feel the same way every time
I come in this room.

Sandy doesn't care
about this sort of thing,

so I've really got
carte blanche in here,

and I am so pleased
with how it came out.

I can't do this.

Hmm.

Thank you, Lord.

You okay?

Oh!

Mr. Price-Owens.
Dr. Price-Owens.

Both?

Moral support.

Down the hall and to the left.

You're in "A."
Okay.

And you're in "B."

Can't we just go together?

You're in "A." He's in "B."

Yeah?

Kind of awkward, isn't it?

Yeah.

Well, let's get going.

This would be so much easier
if you were, you know, in here,

because then it would just be...
Easier.

Try the porn.

Honestly, how could anyone
get off to this?

It's - did you -?
Do you have a -?

shh, shh, shh!

I'm trying to concentrate.

We can't leave Miranda
in the waiting room all day.

Miranda is an angel.

I mean, how lucky were we
to have her fall into our laps?

Technically, it was our laptop.

shut up.

And get little Terry into gear.

God damn it.

I will.

You don't have to curse at Him.

Ugh! Humidity!

so, uh well,
this is just a little awkward,

so here goes, I guess.

Which one of you...?

Oh.

Oh, we always wanted
to mix and match.

Oh. Mix and match. I see.

I just assumed -
Assumed what?

Because he's white
and an ivy-league education

and a doctor it would be him?

Be nice.

I'm always nice, Sandy.

We thought we would
mix and match -

some of mine, some of his -
let nature figure it out.

No, you mean God.
God will decide.

Yes, darlin', I do mean God.

God will come down
from the heavens

and decide which gay man's sperm
is the swiftest.

Will it be mine?
Will it be his? Who's to say?

Excuse us for a minute.
Thank you very much.

Um, need I remind you
that she's doing us

the biggest favor
that I can conceive of?

Conceive - that's -
That is very funny, Dr. P.O.

Amen!

Are you washed

In the blood

In the soul-cleansing
blood of the lamb?

Are your garments spotless?

Are they white as snow?

Are you washed
in the blood of the lamb?

Have you been to Jesus
for the cleansing power?

Are you washed
in the blood of the lamb?

Are you fully trusting
in His grace this hour?

Are you washed
in the blood of the lamb?

Are you washed

In the blood

In the soul-cleansing
blood of the lamb?

Are your garments spotless?

Are they white as snow?

Are you washed
in the blood of the lamb?

Praise the Lord.

Oh.

Excuse me.

It's here.

Okay, uh...

Hi. Hi, yes.
This is Miranda Bliss.

Uh, the doctor told me to call

as soon as my -
my - my package arrived.

Don't look now,
the Lord is comin'

Comin' to guide you home

Don't be sad
'cause He'll be singin'

Songs to guide you home

Bye.

You can ease up now,
smiley man.

We've been approved.
I'm pregnant.

she's not allowed to just
come along and take our baby.

Relax, hon. Debbie sue's
just doin' her job.

Oh, Tom!

What?

Great God,
attend while zion sings

Thejoy that from
Thy presence springs...

Hi.

Oh, there you go, Ma'am.

They've become kind of enormous,
which Tom is enjoying, of course,

and they're not too tender
for him to, you know.

Well, how nice for you.

All I'm getting is this constant
bloating and a voice inside

warning me to never be
that far away from a bathroom.

I don't remember this
with Parker Jr. I'm...

Are you pregnant?

I was -
I was gonna tell you, honey.

Yeah? Yeah?
And just when was that?

Well, I just - I wanted
to make sure everything was -

I thought this was a team effort.

A what?

The Destiny's Children program.

I mean, how could you just
sign us up without my consent?

Oh, uh...

Thank you, Lord.

Parker, I'm -

Miranda, I need to say somethin'.

Me and the Lord -
we been talkin'.

And, well, we agree 100%.

I need to welcome
this Destiny's Child into my home

and into my heart.

We really need to talk.

Oh, sweetie, no time for that.

We got to get ready
to have this baby.

I mean, I-I know
you're already doin' your part,

but I got a lot of work to do.

I mean, I got to get the -
the baby's room.

There's...

Geez, there's a lot of stuff to do.

P- Parker.

Yeah, I think maybe if I s-start...

Oh, lead me, Lord

Oh, please show me Your way

Guide me to the righteous path

And I will never stray

Take a gander, sweetheart.

Where have you been all night?

Floor plan for the baby's room.

Now, if you see anything you want
to change, just let me know.

Oh, now - now, Parker,
my pregnancy -

What? Are they here already?

Who's here?

You'll see.

Hey, guy.

Lightnin'- fast service,
just like they promised.

What have you gone and done,
Parker?

Oh, we just got a few things,
honey.

All right.

Here, buddy,
let me give you a hand.

Oh, my. Okay.

Hey, Miranda.

Thank you.

I can't believe this.

Who's that?

T- that's, um, Mr. T- Price-Owens,

the one - the one
I was tellin' you about.

He's - he's here
for the, um, caterin' position.

Caterin' position?

You're nesting. That's not allowed.
You're not supposed to be nesting.

I'm the one that's supposed
to be nesting.

"Nesting"? What's he talking
about "nesting"?

It's a cookin' term.

Okay, why don't you boys
move that into the shed?

And you come on inside
for a cold drink, okay?

I'm sure Mr. Terry Price-Owens here
is tired and thirsty from his journey.

I am.

That is so beautiful.

Hmm?
I really love this one.

Sandy wanted me
to mail them to you,

but I really wanted
to deliver them personally.

Oh, and they're sized differently.

These will take you
from five months

right up until just before
your water breaks.

Wow.

Uh, last time,
when I was carrying Parker Jr.,

i think I'd just throw on
a pair of his daddy's overalls

most of the time.

so, uh, Mister...

Price-Owens.
No. Terry.

No, please call me Terry.

You're here to see about
joining Miranda and her sister

in the caterin' business?

Well, um...

Yes.

Yes, um, Miranda
had expressed an interest

in expanding Fishes & Loaves

into the predominantly
African-American church market,

where I have a number of contacts.

Huh.

When you think about it, it really
does just kind of leap out at you.

As congregations grow and
churches get bigger and bigger,

the traditional potluck dinner
is really a thing of the past,

and that's where professionals
like Miranda

and - and myself come in.

Oh, thank you.

It sounds like you got this
right figured out.

I certainly hope so, Parker,

if - if you don't mind me
calling you Parker.

In fact, my collaboration
with Miranda and my associate

is already beginning to bear fruit.

Well, it's, uh, good news, I guess.

Uh, if - if you'll excuse us
a minute.

Ugh.

First the other thing.

Now you know full well
this fella's comin' into town,

you don't do me the courtesy
of a heads-up?

Honey, his arrival
kind of took me by surprise.

Terry, I-I wasn't expecting you
so early.

I'm really so sorry, Miranda.
I- I jumped the gun.

I just wanted to show you how much
I appreciate this opportunity.

Oh, okay.
That must be Lucy.

I'm gonna go see if she knows
where we're gonna put you up.

Uh, honey, can you help him get
his bags out to the van, please?

Great. Okay.

Yeah.

I see you're not exactly
a believer in traveling light.

The man came all the way
down here from Boston

to give you maternity clothes?

I guess.

And he - you told Parker
we're auditioning him

for Fishes & Loaves?

It's funny how
she hasn't mentioned it before.

I mean, I haven't heard word one

about her wanting
to expand like this.

Well, however she came to it,
I am, as you folks say,

pleased as punch to play my part.

Yeah.

Okay, be careful.

Okay, honey,
help me get him out of here

before he starts asking Parker
questions about that baby crib.

Okay! We ready to go?

I got that - Could you be -?
It has wheels on it.

Yeah, I don't like to use the wheels.

But that's what the wheels are for.

No, no, don't -

He's got it.
You got it, honey?

I really like your husband,
especially the mustache.

Very charming.

We need to get you settled
into your motel

so I can buy the time I need
to find a better way

to explain to Parker
about what you're doin' here.

Terry, what are you doin' here?

Um...

Oh!

I- I am so sorry.

I guess I plumb forgot
to introduce you two.

Terry, this is my sister, Lucy.

she knows all about you,
Sandy, and the baby.

Luce, may I present to you
Mr. Terry Price-Owens?

50% likely putative father

of the child I'm carrying
at the Lord's behest.

Um... Pleased to meet you.

Ah. Likewise.

I don't think I've ever been introduced
in quite those terms before.

Well, these are
extraordinary times.

Amen.
Amen.

Now, you tell me if I'm speaking
out of turn here,

but I do believe our man Terry

has come down here
from Boston, Massachusetts,

expecting to run your life 24/7
until you deliver the goods.

T- that's not a possibility.

You're wrong, Lucy.
No?

Then why'd he make us stop off
so he could buy himself

a top-of-the-line
portable sewing machine

if he isn't planning on being
down here for the long haul?

Oh, Lucy.

Oh, no.

Oh. Look, Lucy -

I'll be blunt because Miranda can't.

Mr. Price-Owens - Terry -

Don't you have a job
to get back to up north?

Lucy.

Oh, the beauty
of the kind of work I do

is that it can be done
from anywhere.

Well, how lucky for Miranda.

And, uh, how will -

How does the other
Mr. Price-Owens feel

about your absence?

My partner, Sandy,
is very supportive.

There is the matter of the mattress.

The what?
The what?

Well, so much for your hope

that Terry won't be trying
to micromanage your pregnancy.

Oh, I'm so sorry, Lucy.
I couldn't help but overhear.

And I challenge you
to offer one good reason

why my child's carrier shouldn't
have the most restful sleep

commercially available.

Well, silly me.

I thought that's what
her uterus was for.

You know, I think I detect
a bit of jealousy here.

And where, for that matter,
is your husband?

And why is he not here
at the Heavenly Rest

selecting a premium model for you

as I intend to do for Miranda?

Uh, Miranda?
Excuse me, doll.

I really love this comfort
Extraordinaire super King,

and I think it would be perfect
for you and Parker.

I take it your lifestyle coach
from up Beantown Way

hasn't been upstairs
in your house yet.

Now may be a good time
to tell Terry here

how the super King-sized mattress

would be a super
king-sized mistake.

You know, it's funny -

Okay! Just stop talking!

You have no right
to run offabandoning me,

driving that woman bananas.

Call me.

"Directions. Warning.

Isobutane. " Of course.

Let's see.

Ugh.

Hey, what you lookin' for?
Hey.

Um, uh, arrowroot.

I'm looking for the arrowroot.

That's some kind of spice?

Um, I'm making a fruit pie.

My grandmother
has this amazing recipe,

and I thought I'd make some
for Miranda and Lucy.

You should stay around
for the taste test later.

Oh, yeah? I might just
take you up on that, Terry.

I do enjoy a good fruit pie.
Yeah, yeah, me too.

Hey, uh, what's goin' on
in here, boys?

Hey, hon, can you help him
find the arrowroot?

Arrowroot, huh?

Yeah, I got to head down
to the church.

Got to help the pastor
with a busted ceiling light.

see y'all later.

Okay. Hey, bye, Parker.

What are you doin' in here?

Have you ever heard
of teratogens?

"Terato" what?
Teratogens.

Excuse me.

I mean, who puts this
next to the flour?

Miranda, scientists have identified
over 325 substances

that are directly linked
to malformation in fetuses.

Well, someone has certainly
been doin' his homework.

I really need you
to take this seriously.

Over 325 substances,

and they are all found
in common household products.

All right, I don't know
where you think you are, Mister,

but I would greatly appreciate it
if you would get out of my kitchen,

'cause I - I've got work to do.

And so do I.
Okay.

And this, too. Poison!

What in God's name
are you doin' in here?

All these things are toxins,
so I just want to throw them out

and make the environment safe
for when the baby gets here.

Okay, you know what?
That's it!

I want you to leave.

Go back to the motel, and do not
come back here until I say so!

Git!

You are sneaking into the
workshop ofa fanatic homophobe

to help him
with his spring cleaning,

andI'm supposed to remain calm?

What in the hell does this
have to do with our baby?

No, no. This woman is perfectly
capable of having this baby

without you
breathing down her neck,

so I would like you to come home
before you ruin everything.

There's not a friend
like the lowly Jesus

No, not one

None else could heal
all our souls'diseases

No, not one

Jesus knows
all about our struggles

He will guide
till the day is done

There's not a friend
like the lowly Jesus

No, not one

There's not an hour
that He is not near us

No, not one

No night so dark
but His love can cheer us

No, not one

If we're gonna do this thing,
let's do it.

I love this fabric.

You promised the man a fruit pie.

No, not one

Put some clothes on.

No, not one

Hormones.

Lucy, I'm home.

Lucy?

Baby.

sweetheart?

Hey.

Tom...
I went downtown today.

Lucy, honey, you'll never guess

who I ran into today
down at the Coover Diner.

I might.

Debbie sue Dawson.

Guess what.

Come on.
I bet ya can't guess.

Come on. Come on.

It's okay.

Well, I'm gonna tell ya.

Debbie sue - s-she wants to know
c- could you and I

give a series of presentations
to couples around here

that are lookin'
into Destiny's Children.

seein' as how we're so excited
and satisfied by the program.

Presentations?

That's what you two were talkin'
about over at the diner?

Well, yeah, honey.

she wants us to be
her spokespeople.

Whole region - her territory.

It's region 12.
That's what she told me.

I'm so sorry.

It's okay.
I love you.

I love you, too, baby.

Whoa, easy on the arrowroot there,
Martha stewart.

You want to thicken it a tad,

not turn it into a fruit-flavored
concrete block.

Well, Miranda,
it is my first time.

Now, why does that
not surprise me?

Hmm, I don't know.

I'm not the one
who lied to my husband.

I'll take it from here,
thank you very much.

Fine.

First rule of a good manager -
learn how to delegate.

Hmm.

Well, go ahead.

Tell me what you whipped us up
for dessert.

Wait. Don't tell me. surprise me.

Tom, I did mention it, didn't I?

We're invited to my sister's
for dessert.

That Terry fella we're auditioning
for Fishes & Loaves -

word is he was tearing up
the kitchen all afternoon.

He's supposed to show us
what he can do.

sweetheart, I-I can't do that.

I got to meet a client
after he gets off of work.

You know how the boss says
I got to go out of my way

and accommodate all these clients.

Look.

Tell you what.

I will scoot right on over there
as soon as I'm done with this guy.

It's all right.
You don't have to bother.

Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

Parker.

Thanks, Terry.

Looks good.

Tell you somethin', Terry,
that's a tasty pie.

Whatever you do, hon, don't
let him get away. He's good.

Not much chance
of that happenin', sweetheart.

I believe
Mr. Terry Price-Owens here

is with us for the long haul.

Amen.

This is your little ol'
Georgia peach Terry Price-Owens.

Please leave a message, y'all.
Yee-haw!

You are driving me crazy.

Mmm.

Well, it's a shame I can't
stick around for another slice.

Parker's headin' out to help out
with the Family Martial Arts.

Oh. Is that why
he's wearing that... Gi?

I thought it was some strange
local custom I knew nothing about.

Break a board for me, Parker.
Two, if you're so inclined.

Will do, Terry.

Hmm?

That's ridiculous.
You can't see any features.

How can you possibly say
he looks like your grandfather?

That does look like my grand-

First of all,
you never met my grandfather.

second, you see that right there?

Right there. That bump.

It's right here, too.
What bump?

The bump.
Those are feet.

Everybody on my mother's side
of the family

has feet just like that -
those are feet.

I can't even tell if I'm lookin'
at a head or a kneecap.

That's because
you're looking at feet.

Oh, good Lord.

There's so much room in there.
Mine are all scrunched up.

What?

Twins, Terry.

she's having twins.
she just found out.

Isn't it wonderful?

Oh. Yes, it is wonderful.

Congratulations.

Hey. What's goin' on?

I - we're just, um...

What's that? It...

Pictures of our baby?

What, you show this fella
before you show me?

You don't understand, Parker.

Oh, I understand, all right.

Well, who's shutting who out now?

All right, I-I ca-
I can't do this anymore.

Well, then, spell it out
for me then, Miranda.

Parker, this child I am carrying,
it is not a Destiny's Child.

What are you talking about?

That baby in there -
That's our baby.

No, Parker.

It's not.

I'm carrying this baby as a surrogate
for a couple out of Boston.

"surrogate"? W-?

Yes, Parker.

I prayed hard on it, Parker.
I- I did.

I'm - I'm just trying
to obey the Lord here.

How dare you!

How dare you put
what you have done on the Lord!

Whose baby is this?

It's his.

Well, is there anything else you think
I might want to know, Terry?

I am...

not a chef.

shame on you.

shame on all you.

This is
Dr. Sandford Price-Owens.

Please leave a message
at the beep.

Hey, Sandy.

It's Terry.

Miss you.

so, look, I know we've had
some bumps along the way,

and I'm trying to unbump them.

Call me back, okay?

Please.

Hangman's coming now

The sky's turned gray

No one's laughing anymore

Standing alone

The moon on his face

Hangman's coming now

Soon it's gonna rain

Well, if it ain't Papa Terry.

You reckon you want
to take me on?

Yeah. Be my pleasure.

Soon it's gonna rain

Break through this life
ofhardness and pain

Taking the blood from a stone

At the end of the road,
it all looks the same

Hangman's coming now

Soon it's gonna rain

Not much of a bowler, I see.

Well, let me show you.

You want to keep your hand
under the ball, not on top.

That's your problem.

I'm gonna show you.

One of these days,
I'm gonna pack up my things

Follow my heart on the road

see what I mean?

Yeah.

Yeah. Give it a shot.

On the bottom?

Yeah, keep your hand underneath,
not on the top.

Keep that wrist stiff now.

At the end of the road,
it all looks the same

Hangman's coming now

Soon it's gonna rain

Well, looks like you're catchin' on.

Near about
took apart our marriage

just as sure as it took apart
our boy's nervous system.

I tell you, I don't wish
that disease on any family.

What it did to us.

D.s. just...

Dietrich-Schygulla.

Yeah.

My Sandy deals with it every day,
brings it home every night.

I don't think I say it enough.
I don't think I -

I tell him how proud I am of him.

"Him"?
You - you mean her.

No, I-I meant he.

Um, Sandy is my husband.

sanford Price-Owens.

We have been married
for four years legally.

And - and, Parker, I didn't -
I didn't mean to spring this on you.

I-I really did not.
Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah.

That didn't go well.

Mind if I come in?

Yeah, come on in.

I brought music -

Oh.

Um, for the baby.
Okay.

Well, scientists say
they can hear in utero,

so thought I'd bring something
that Sandy and I like.

Okay, well, uh...
I have work to do.

Actually, I, uh,
I kind of need you to stay,

because you...

Right.
You have the baby.

Wow.

Whoo.

Do you like this kind of music?

Uh, yeah, sure.

Do you, uh... dance?

Not like that, sir.

Well, lucky for you,
I'm a choreographer, so I can...

I don't need a choreographer.
I've got my own moves.

Excuse me.

I didn't mean to insult you.

so, uh, so show me the moves.

You first.

Okay.

Wow.

Well, you can join in.
It's okay.

It's easy.
We're just doing a little salsa.

so you one, two.

I know it feels awkward,

but when you just start moving,
you get used to it.

Yeah, just relax, you know?

I'm relaxed.

Okay.

Very nice.

some nice hip action there,
Terry dear.

Keep the hands steady.

That's it. Now -

Oh, okay.

That's all right.
stay with me.

I'm with you.

see?

Whoo! Oh!

Okay.

Back in.
Okay.

That's it. Very nice.

I'm impressed.

Do you want to hear
something funny?

sure.

Parker and I -
we used to dance all the time.

Yeah.
That's, uh, that's funny.

Well, it's not that funny.

He was a -
he was a good dancer.

He just would tear up
the dance floor.

You -
you should have seen it.

Parker?
Yes, Parker.

He was.

Ooh!
Ter-

And spin out.

This is salsa.

I'm gonna teach you more.

I'm sure you will. Hi.

Miranda Bliss?
Yes, sir.

For you, Ma'am.

Thank you.

What is it?

Looks like my bowling buddy
is suing for custody of our child.

I'm sorry.

Farewell, my friends

I'm bound for Canaan

I'm travelin'
through the wilderness

Your company has...

You got to admit, I warned you.

How long did you two think

you could pull the wool
over Parker's eyes?

I wasn't thinking that far ahead.

Oh, honey, since
the day Terry Price-Owens

showed up on my doorstep,
I've just been winging it.

Well, the one thing
I can't understand is,

why in heaven's name does Parker
even want the gay men's baby?

I have spent the last week
praying on that exact question.

And the Lord, if He knows, sure
enough isn't dropping any hints.

There's Parker.
I'll see you inside.

All right.

Look, I don't expect you
to understand, Parker.

Maybe you will someday,
but please remember one thing -

no matter what happens here,

I love you very much.

Well, if you do, you'd just stop with -

But this baby -
that is somethin' else entirely.

I feel blessed
that the Lord has chosen me

to help these two good men
with the family they always wanted.

Miranda, you are playing with fire.

Truly, you will be sorry.

Ms. Mason, does your client

contend in any other way
we may have failed to imagine

that - that he -
that Parker Bliss sr.

is this child-to-be's
biological father?

MAsON: No, Your Honor,
he does not.

Mr. Bliss asserts his paternal
rights under the applicable law

given his status as lawful
husband of Miranda Bliss,

who has testified that she is,
after all, undeniably pregnant.

Dr. Price-Owens,

do we know who is
the actual biological father?

I am.
I am.

I see.

The witness may step down.

There being nothing further,

I'm ready to rule
on the motion at hand.

The extensive testimony

and clinical evidence to back it
all up tell me that these -

these men have successfully
borrowed Miranda's uterus

for the - for the duration.

And, um

the Price-Owenses
and Mrs. Bliss here

have met their evidentiary
burden of showing

that though you, Parker,
are Miranda's husband,

you are not the biological
father of this child.

And for that matter,
everyone involved

seems to agree that Miranda
is not its mother.

Listen, if I'm sounding
a bit squeamish

talkin' out loud about all of this,
well, by golly, I am.

But my duty is my duty, Parker,

and I am forced
to deny your motion.

Case dismissed.

You didn't lose, Parker.
There's no winners or losers here.

It - it's not about that.

And Terry Price-Owens -
he's - he's the same man

you were just getting to know
and really like

before - before you knew.

I mean, isn't he?

Parker.

Oh, the blood ofJesus

It washes white as snow

Hyah!

Hyah!

Ron, I just saw Parker pulling out
while I was pulling in.

Just what did he say to you?

Uh, I'm sorry, Miranda,
but things being what they are,

we're gonna go with another
caterer for the awards banquet.

We really can't have
this kind of attention just now.

I'm sorry.

I got to get back to my kids.

Cab's gonna be here
in five.

Have you seen my Prada?

The two-tone loafers
you got me for my birthday?

Oh, you returned those
and got yourself a different pair.

Aha!

Who is it?

I don't know, but you're not
allowed to touch it.

Where did you put my phone,
Sandy?

No!

stop wrinkling all the clothes!

Tell her you're on your way
to the airport.

Hey, Miranda.

Mm-hmm, we're on our way
to the airport.

Hmm.

Oh, my God!

He did what?

I'm on my way.

Yep. Right now.
I'm on my way.

What? What happened?

Parker sr. went and badmouthed
Lucy and Miranda,

and they decided to find another
caterer for the award banquet.

Terrible!
Put on some pants.

Sandy, I cannot go to Boston.

I need to take this cab, and I need
to go to Miranda's right now.

Why don't you call her
when we get to Boston?

Because I can't!

Sandy!

I'm doing this for us.

Oh, you have done
quite enough already.

If you hadn't insisted
on coming down here,

Miranda would have handled this
all by herself,

and none of this
would have happened!

You don't talk to me like that.

You don't tell me what to do
or how to do it.

And when I do come home,

you better be standing there with a...

a warm heart
and a smile, okay?

You better hope
I haven't changed the locks.

You wouldn't.

Try me.

Sandy!

Take a picture. It lasts longer.

You know, we had
a fella at the church, he, uh...

Well, he had your condition and -

Let me guess.
You put him in a cure program.

30-day treatment?

Yep.

Church paid his expenses,
as a matter of fact.

You know what?
It worked.

That's wonderful.

Maybe Sandy and I can check in,

possibly even get
a couple's discount,

maybe even share a bunk bed.

Yeah, well, maybe the program's
not for everyone.

Thank you.

Now that we, um, got that
out of the way...

I want to know the extent of your
campaign to ruin Fishes & Loaves.

Ain't no campaign.

It's just the one -
the Family Martial Arts.

Tell Miranda not to worry.
I won't be interfering anymore.

Well, that's, uh...

That's reassuring.

How long you envision
staying out here?

I don't rightly know.

Well, if you, uh -
if you have a prolonged stay,

I could decorate the place
a little bit.

Curtains, some chairs.

You know, just make it
more comfortable.

Yeah, well,
I appreciate that, Terry,

but maybe I'll just see
how it goes, okay?

You know, the funny thing is...

you're standing here

having a polite conversation
with a gay man,

and the world
didn't come to an end.

It's a miracle.

What are you drawin'?

None of your business.

It's a surprise.

Oh.

I like surprises.

I, uh...

I have to go back to Boston.

Tonight.

You're leaving?

Now?

I promise I will be back.

I just...

Who - who's gonna be
in charge around here?

I miss Sandy.

Come here, you.

When the roll

When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

When the roll

When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

When the roll

When the roll is called up yonder

When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

When the trumpet of the Lord
shall sound

And time shall be no more

And the morning breaks
eternal, bright, and fair

When the saved ofEarth shall
gather over on the other shore

And the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there

When the roll

When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

When the roll

When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

When the roll

When the roll is called up yonder

When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

Would you bring me
that orangy one, Debbie sue?

I think it says "tangerine fantasy"
on the label.

You're not listenin'.

It's now or never, Tom.

You and me -
we're runnin' out of time.

If you can't commit,
I'm gonna take that transfer.

Region 27.
That's North Dakota, Tom.

And I won't be back.

Be honest.

Is she ever gonna give you
what I give you?

Tom!

I want her out of here this minute.

Lucy, that's not very nice.

If that baby-broker bureaucrat's
not gone by the time I open my eyes,

I may be forced to do something
very unchristian.

Git!

Hey, now, you're breaking
rule number one -

no crying on the drumsticks.

You're watering
down the marinade.

I know, Lucy.

Come on. Try to hold it
together, okay?

At least till after the baby shower.

You think you can do that?

Do I have a choice?

No, as far as that goes.

Your friends are expecting to come

and share
in your joyous expectation.

Besides, my boys are coming down
from Boston.

They are?

Oh, come on.
You know Terry.

Your pregnancy is the second,
maybe the third,

most exciting thing
to ever happen to him.

Besides, it's just another
excuse for him

to march on down here
and start issuing orders again.

Is Parker gonna be there?

Yeah, I-I think so.

He's still staying out
in that shed of his.

But...

we have started exchanging
grunts every now and again.

Oh, Lord.

What about Debbie sue?

I think I've come up
with a diplomatic way

of disinviting her.

Well... Okay, then.

On with the show.

Oh, my Gosh.
That is so sweet. Thank you.

Oh, thank you so much.

She is?
Yeah.

Parker, would you excuse us
for one second, please?

Yeah, sure.
Okay, thank you.

I'll, uh, catch you later.

I told you we'd have to be
on the lookout for this.

Now aren't you glad
that we're here?

I know.

I was so sure the Lord would
protect me from these feelings.

It certainly would be nicer
for all of us

if He was a little bit more
attentive in that regard.

Miranda, what Terry is saying,

or trying to say if he weren't busy
shooting his mouth off,

is that we understand how hard
it is for you and the baby -

It's not "the" baby, really, is it?

I mean, it's our baby.

Huh. I thought I told you
to be quiet.

I'm sorry.
I'm - I'm just saying.

Terry and I understand
your bond with our child,

and we love you the more for it.

Maybe I was a fool to think
that I could live up

to the expectations
the Lord has for me.

I mean,
it is an interesting point.

You did make a sacred oath...
Shh!

...with the Lord and to us.

And I think that's something
we all should consider -

Shut up!
Ooh!

No!
Ooh, Terry!

You bitch!

Not you, Miranda.

We want you to be a part
of his or her life afterwards.

As big a part as you want to be.

Yes, Miranda, we want you to be
a part of the child's life.

Just under... certain
clearly defined conditions.

Oh!

so, you're coming up to Boston
for my dance performance, right?

Now remind me
when it is again.

Opening night is in two weeks.

Okay, promise me I'll see you
there at 7:30 sharp, okay?

Wild horses couldn't keep me away.

Ooh!

Ooh, I forgot.

You have a good flight.

Bye.

Let's get out of here.

You - you are perfection.

Oh.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, who will come
and go with me?

I am on myjourney home

I'm bound fair Canaan's land...

Lucy?

I am on myjourney home

Lucy!

Hey, I got this baby table for you!

Oh, come and go with me

Lucy?

For I'm on myjourney home

Like a river in my soul

Hey. What's -?
What's the matter, girl?

He's gone, Parker.

Tom's gone.

Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

Oh.

I got peace like a river

I got peace like a river
in my soul

In my soul

I got peace like a river

I got peace like a river
in my soul

I got love like an ocean

I've got love like an ocean

I've got love like an ocean
in my soul

In my soul

I got love like an ocean

I've got love like an ocean

I've got love like an ocean
in my soul

I've got peace like a river
in my soul

Peace like a river
in my soul

Terry.

But that was just
the most beautiful thing.

I think I saw the divine spark
up there on that stage.

He's a genius, huh?

Oh!

Miranda!

What happened?

Out of the way!

Call 911!

Call 911!
Take this phone!

somebody get help now!

It was a girl.

she...

The E.R. Chief
said that she, um -

she wouldn't have survived,
even if you had gone to term.

What?

I'm so sorry.

Parker, I let my guys down.

I guess I just didn't pray
hard enough.

Oh, no. Oh, nonsense, dear.

she was very brave.

Parker, this is a wonderful woman.

I hope you appreciate
how lucky you are.

I'm - I'm tryin', Terry.
I'm tryin' just as hard as I can.

I'm gonna -
I'm gonna take care of you.

I'm gonna take care of us, okay?

If you'll let me.

Yeah?

Oh, who will come and go
with me?

I am on myjourney home

I'm bound fair Canaan's land

I'm afraid the bad news
is coming in clumps these days.

Parker?

Tom, your sister's husband,
he done run off

with that Destiny's Children woman -
Debbie sue.

says he's gonna divorce Lucy.

Oh, my Lord!

I want them out now!

They've been implanted in me
by Debbie sue Dawson,

an agent of satan!

Lucy -
I will not!

I cannot bear these seeds
of the devil!

Lucy, calm down, okay?

Lord, help me!

Aah!

Please, Lord!

Sandy!

The devil - he's here!

The evil one, he's come
to collect his children.

Just breathe.
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

No! Oh, they're here! They're here!
Come on.

Oh, they're here!

Aah!

Oh, Miranda! Please, Lord!

Look at you.

so beautiful. Look at you.

Everything looks really good.

Well, little lady, you did it.

It was a very special delivery here.

Get - get -
get them away from me.

In granting this adoption today,
I am pleased,

though a little surprised, frankly,
to be making history in this state.

I live and I learn and am pleased
to be that old dog

who can occasionally manage
to master a new trick.

Times change,
and enlightened thinking

sometimes reaches
into strange corners

that we were not smart enough
to anticipate in the past.

Although...

the circumstances
of the dissolution of one family

are always tragic,

we know that these children are
being welcomed with open arms

and great love by the
Mr. Price-Owens one and two.

Good luck to your new
American family, gentlemen.

I got peace like a river

I got peace like a river
in my soul

In my soul

I got peace like a river

I got peace like a river
in my soul

Just wait. Just hold on.

I can't feel anything.

You can't feel that?

You sure our baby's in there?

I'm pretty sure he's in there.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Did you feel that?
Yeah.

You did?

Thank you, Lord.

I've got peace like a river
in my soul

Once when I was a child
I cried because I'd lost my way

Then I heard a voice inside...

Albert?

Why don't you try one of
my little ol' peach muffins?

Why, sure.

Uh...

Lucy, thank you so much.

Yeah, I think you'll find it
quite tasty.

And, Albert, the wonderful thing
about these muffins

is they're made mainly from
ingredients that were around

when the Bible
was first set down on paper.

Mmm.

Thank you.

They're so good.

Don't look now,
the Lord is comin'

Comin' to guide you home

Don't be sad
'cause He'll be singin'

Songs to guide you home

Don't look now,
the Lord is comin'

Comin' to guide you home

Don't be sad

Don't be sad
'cause He'll be singin'

Songs to guide you home

He'll be comin'
to guide you home

When the Lord calls my name

I will stand
and I'll hold my head up high

There'll be no cause for shame

When I'm called to the Lord,
then I will fly

I will fly

I will fly like an angel
to the Lord

I will fly

I will fly like an angel
to the Lord

There's not a friend
like the lowly Jesus

No, not one

None else could heal
all our souls'diseases

No, not one

Jesus knows
all about our struggles

He will guide
till the day is done

There's not a friend
like the lowly Jesus

No, not one

Great God,
attend while zion sings

Thejoy that
from Thy presence springs

To spend one day
with Thee on Earth

Exceeds a thousand days
ofmirth

Farewell, my friends

I'm bound for Canaan

I'm travelin'
through the wilderness

Your company
has been delightful

You who doth leave
my mind distressed

I go away behind to leave you

Perhaps never to meet again

But if we never
have that pleasure

I hope we'll meet
on Canaan's land

But if we never
have that pleasure

I hope we'll meet
on Canaan's land
