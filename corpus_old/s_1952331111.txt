[ applause ]

>> Jimmy: There you go.

It's over with.

This guy was crying the whole

Time.

I really am embarrassed for him.

Well, "lost" is done.

I don't know what we have left.

I really don't.

Tonight the cast is here to

Reflect, to dissect and to

Hopefully answer the question

That I think is on everyone's

Mind right now -- what the hell

Just happened?

>> announcer: Tonight, Jimmy

Kimmel hosts the cast of "lost."

Brought to you by bud light.

>> Jimmy: Thank you.

"lost" crash landed in our

Living rooms with a story about

Love, death, good, evil, time

Travel, polar bears and fried

Chicken.

And if you're expecting it all

To get wrapped up tonight,

You're probably missing the

Point of the show.

Two things I think we learned

For sure though.

Number one, don't go chasing

Waterfalls.

[ laughter ]

And number two, all dogs don't

Necessarily go to heaven.

[ laughter ]

All right.

Well, let's -- where better to

Begin than with the guy who

Began it all and with whom it

Ended too, Dr. Jack Shepherd?

Please welcome Matthew fox,

Everybody.

[ cheers and applause ]

I'm so happy to see you alive

Right now, I really am.

[ cheers and applause ]

So that was the first time you'd

Seen the ending, right?

>> that was the first time,

Yeah.

Just sitting backstage.

It's pretty moving.

Yeah.

>> Jimmy: You feel a little bit

Like Tom Sawyer looking in on

Your own funeral?

Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

It's hard to watch for me.

But sometime down the road I

Suppose I'll go back and watch

It all the way through.

>> Jimmy: Your neck has healed

Up.

That's good news.

>> yeah, yeah.

>> Jimmy: I want to present you,

If I could, with my theory on

What happened.

Okay?

In a lot of religions,

Christianity being one of them,

The idea is life is a test.

That you go through your life

And if you're good, you go to

Heaven or nirvana or whatever.

And if you're bad, you don't,

You go to hell or you don't go

Anywhere.

My theory is that the whole show

From beginning to end, we're

Watching Jack's test.

His test.

And his life on the island I

Think was his real life.

>> yes.

>> Jimmy: You think --

>> I completely agree with that.

>> Jimmy: I'm on a roll.

>> yep, yep.

>> Jimmy: Obviously, Jack passed

The test.

>> yes.

>> Jimmy: And maybe the

Characters -- maybe each of the

Characters has their own story

And their own test.

But this show I think was Jack's

Test.

>> I would agree with that.

I mean --

>> Jimmy: I'm so proud of myself

Right now, you have no idea.

[ cheers and applause ]

>> but at the same time,

That's -- what's beautiful with

The way it ends is there's room

For interpretation depending on

People's spiritual beliefs.

I think there are also religions

That believe that when you die

You go to a place -- and that

Place can last for a nano second

Or it can be an extended period

Of time.

Where you have to remember your

Own death and all of the people

That were instrumental, that you

Loved the most and henn helped

The most and were the most

Important to you.

You have to remember all of

Them.

And remembering them, lead up to

The moment you died, before you

Can move on to whatever's next.

>> Jimmy: I want to look at a

Clip from the first episode of

This srngs t

This season, the final season.

This is when you were on a plane

Again.

Take a look.

>> don't worry.

>> you got to go now.

It's okay, you can let go.

>> Jimmy: Now, I think what

Happened during that turbulence

Is Jack died there.

And when the plane calmed down,

That's when you passed over, and

Maybe the whole island, the

Adventure, the journey, all that

Stuff happened in the nano

Second, as you said.

>> that's possible.

[ laughter ]

>> Jimmy: I have another theory

I've been working on.

Because Jack was with Kate and

Kate was with Sawyer and then

Jack was with Juliette and

Juliette was with Sawyer.

There's another thing I'm

Hedonism like tea party island.

All inclusive, of course.

You don't have to pay for

Anything extra.

>> it was a little bit like

That, that's for sure.

>> Jimmy: Well, you told us and

You've said this a number of

Times, that you knew what the

Ending was at the beginning.

You knew what the ending to the

Show was.

Were you telling the truth?

>> I knew the final image.

I knew the show would end with

His eye closing.

I knew that he would die.

And I just hoped beyond hope

That there would be redemption

In that.

I believe there is.

You know, it's been an

Incredible, incredible

Experience playing this guy.

Taken him the four years to

Where he becomes sort of a

Broken man and has deviated from

His destiny on the island.

And knows that he has to go back

Or he'll die.

And then start to embrace the

Notion that he has this thing to

Do on the island and that he's

Going to give his life in doing

It.

He starts to feel strong.

And has given over to the notion

That that's exactly whether he's

Meant to do.

And yeah.

So I always knew the show would

End with his eye closing.

>> Jimmy: We got a lot of the

Gang here tonight.

Hey, can we just get one shot of

Your eye closing one more time?

[ laughter ]

>> no way.

>> Jimmy: We have quite an hour

Planned for tonight.

Matthew fox is with us.

Much of the cast is with us.

We have the never before seen

Alternate endings to the show

With Damon Lindelof and Carlton

Cuse.

We'll be right back with Ben

Linus and Locke, Michael Emerson

And Terry O'Quinn.

>> oh, hi!

I'm Stephen Colbert.

Congratulating "lost" on a great

Run.

Now, I've never seen lost.

But I was a huge fan of the

Series it was based on,

"Gilligan's island."

I have to say, in this new

Version, it was even harder to

Choose between ginger and m

Maryanne.

My only disappointment was the

Globetrotters never showed up.

Or did they?

Rewatch season three, episode

Seven very carefully.

Anyway, "lost," congratulations

On finally going off the air.

I got to say, I never saw that

Ending coming.

That j.J. Abrams is a genius.

>> announcer: Abc's "jimmy

Kimmel live" "aloha to lost"

Brought to you by bud light.

>> Jimmy: Matthew fox is with us

As we say "aloha to lost."

The final season and complete

Collection available on blueray

And DVD on August 24th.

We're honored, by the way, to

Have the great academy award

Winning composer with us

Tonight.

Sitting in with our band the

Cletones.

Every once in a while, will you

Do me a favor and give me one of

Those big "lost" blast noises?

Excellent.

Just work that in wherever it

Feels right, you know what I'm

Saying?

>> you got it.

>> Jimmy: Together our next two

Guests played four characters.

Ben Linus, Henry gill, John

Locke and the monster known as

Smoke.

Please welcome Michael Emerson

And Terry O'Quinn.

[ applause ]

?

>> Jimmy: Welcome, thank you for

Coming.

[ cheers and applause ]

By the way, all three of you are

Not nominated at the Emmys this

Year, that will be a travesty.

Right?

I'm looking for the horns kind

Of.

[ laughter ]

?

First of all, I want to --

Terry, is it good Terry or bad

Terry that we have here tonight?

>> it's out of work Terry

Tonight.

>> Jimmy: It's out of work

You guys both got to play good

Guys and bad guys kind of in the

Same guy.

You went back and forth a little

Bit.

Michael, you went back and forth

I think twice in the last

Episode.

Not you of course but your

Character.

Is it more fun to play the --

?

>> nice.

>> Jimmy: More fun to play the

Smoke monster than it is to play

John Locke?

>> it's not more fun, it's just

Different.

You know, the writing has been

Consistently great, so I've had

Fun playing -- I had fun playing

Both of them.

>> I liked that when you were

Playing the smoke monster and

Didn't know you were playing it.

>> that was the best, yeah.

That was all of season five when

I was the smoke monster and

Didn't know it.

>> Jimmy: You never know when

You're the smoke monster.

You really don't.

It just kind of sneaks up on

You.

>> it could be anybody.

It could happen to you.

[ laughter ]

>> Jimmy: I've heard that -- I

Heard that you guys were hoping

To do a show together after

This.

Is that true?

>> well, we joke around a lot on

The set and -- but a lot of

Times we try to think of what

Kind of goofy double act we

Could come up with, you know,

Later on in life.

But once in a while, we have

Kind of a half-clever idea.

And we're just pitching it

Around on street corners and

Other places.

>> Jimmy: Are you, yeah?

>> trying to get something

Going.

>> I have -- it's fun, I've

Loved working with Michael and I

Have said on many occasions I

Would like to again.

>> Jimmy: You should do "the

Amazing race" together.

That be with a great start.

[ applause ]

If you do do a show together,

Can I pitch you something?

>> sure.

>> Jimmy: Okay.

Veg es magicians by night.

Forensic police officers by

Later at night.

Because Vegas is -- you guys go

Around.

Somebody's killing show girls.

You guys have to go around

Solving crime.

One of you maybe plays it very

Straight.

By the book.

The other not so much.

Plays by his own rooms.

>> I think it's a great idea.

What do you guys --

[ cheers and applause ]

>> Jimmy: And we call it --

>> which one would be the one

That didn't play by the rules?

>> Jimmy: Either one of you.

I think you could switch off

Who's playing by the rules and

Who's not playing by the rule.

>> could one have a foreign

Accent?

>> Jimmy: Whatever you want to

Do.

You could be like Sig Freud and

Roy, both have foreign accents.

Somebody gets attacked by a

Tiger.

The other steps in.

It's called "cadaver ka dab Ra."

>> some tights are so great that

No show could live up to the

Promise.

>> Jimmy: That could be one of

Those, absolutely.

You guys, really, the acting on

The show has been phenomenal.

Some of the scenes tonight

Between Jack and Locke were just

Phenomenal.

You guys -- do you goof around

During that -- those scenes?

Or is it very serious?

>> I mean, we goof around quite

A bit.

Yeah.

There's a lot of light stuff in

Between that.

I mean -- right?

>> Jimmy: Are you thinking of

Something in particular?

>> no, somewhat.

You know, Matthew's very

Professional.

Everybody on the show, truly,

Has come -- I mean, well, for

The most part, has come

Prepared.

>> Jimmy: Who's the least

Professional on the set?

>> well, Josh Holloway.

>> Jimmy: Josh Holloway.

[ applause ]

>> is he here tonight?

>> Jimmy: No.

>> he's not here?

>> Jimmy: He's not here.

>> Josh Holloway.

>> Jimmy: Very unprofessional.

There have been many great

Scenes.

What hits you as the most

Memorable for each of your

Characters?

>> I still remember -- I can't

Forget in season one when we

Were shooting the first episode

That I was heavily involved in

That was called "walk about."

And actually in the shooting of

It, I still didn't know -- I had

No idea where we were going of

Course and I didn't know it was

Going to be strong.

When I watched it, it was when

Locke wiggles his toes and

Stands up and the music --

That's when I realized what we

Had with Michael and with Jack.

That's when it all came together

For me.

I said, holy mackerel this could

Really be something.

>> Jimmy: How about you,

Michael?

>> I've had a lot of great

Scenes that involved food.

And there was one with cereal

And there was one where I made

Dinner for Juliette.

One I particularly remember, I

Was being held captive in an

Under water chamber and John

Locke brought me food and said

It was rabbit and I said, did

This have a number on it?

Which is one of those moments I

Knew I was in a comedy.

>> Jimmy: But no one else.

>> but no one else.

>> Jimmy: Matt, how about you,

What really sticks out for you?

>> there's so many.

It's hard to -- I think the

Very -- in the pilot, the scene

Where Kate is stitching up Jack

Was probably just the first

Time -- it was really -- it was

A tough thing to do.

>> Jimmy: Very "Rambo"-esque.

>> it was amazing, he really

Gave me some great notes in that

Scene.

So that stands out.

That was a good one.

?

[ laughter ]

>> Jimmy: Not what I was

Expecting.

That's the show for you.

Never what you're expecting.

All right.

Well, we have a lot to come.

Executive producers Damon

Lindelof and Carlton cuse.

I got a nice drive shaft ring

From Michael.

Thank you, Michael, I think

We're engaged.

We'll be back with more.

Our "aloha to lost."

[ applause ]

>> this is h

>> this is how big a fan I am.

You know the woman, Widmore's

Wife?

I can't even keep up with that

Relationship.

She was at a Christmas party,

The white-haired woman.

I shrieked as I came around the

Corner.

I looked that the woman.

Oh, God, and she takes me aside.

She goes, please don't do that.

[ laughter ]

>>> hello, everybody.

Sorry I couldn't be with you

Tonight.

I'm watching the action from the

Set of my new movie "snakes on

The plane 2 electric boogaloo."

It's about what happened when a

Bunch of deadly snakes attack a

Group of kids on the way to a

Break dancing competition.

I play the Sam Jackson role.

And we're all very proud of it,

Right, guys?

>> right.

Any way, even though I have a

Great new family.

I do miss you guys and I wish I

Could be there.

So I love you.

And remember, keep snaking!

?

>> Jimmy: Things are going well

For Josh I guess.

As we explore this mysterious

Show known as "lost."

Alternate endings.

Visits from more of the cast.

Our next guests are foreigners

To our land.

Please make them feel welcome.

Please say hello to Naveen

Andrews, Daniel Dae Kim and

Emilie De Ravin.

[ applause ]

[ cheers and applause ]

>> Jimmy: Welcome, welcome.

Thank you guys for coming.

And you have not seen -- have

Any of you seen the finale, the

Entire finale?

>> no.

>> Jimmy: So you have no idea

What's going on.

Why are you harboring skulls,

Naveen?

>> it is a gift from Manson to

Emilie.

>> Jimmy: From Charles Manson?

From Marilyn Manson.

Such a big fan of the show.

Terry, I don't know if your

Aware of this, but he painted a

Picture of John Locke.

>> oh, I've got it.

He gave me a print of it.

>> Jimmy: Oh, he did?

Can we see that?

Wow.

Very talented.

I'm surprised Marilyn isn't

Wearing his Hawaiian shirt.

Naveen, you don't watch the

Show, do you?

Is that true?

>> I saw the pilot.

We used to --

>> Jimmy: Saw the pilot.

>> you have to know what the

Piece is and what happens.

We used to go to each other's

Houses and I used to go outside

And have a cigarette and, you

Know.

No, I haven't seen the show.

>> Jimmy: Emilie, you were off

The show for a year.

During that time that you were

Off the show did you watch?

>> no, I didn't, consciously,

Because I figured Claire had no

Clue what was going on so --

>> Jimmy: Really, wow.

>> Emilie would not either.

>> Jimmy: Which was preferable

To you, playing sweet normal

Claire or "can't find my hair

Brush" --

>> um, you know, I don't know.

I actually like a lot of things

About the crazy Claire.

And very luckily that was a wig

So I probably -- if that wasn't,

I probably wouldn't be saying

That.

>> Jimmy: Daniel, one of the

Most emotional moments of the

Show was when Jin and sun

Drowned together, and yet it

Seemed like somebody should have

Stayed around for the baby.

>> a lot of people come up to me

And say that.

>> Jimmy: I would think so,

Yeah.

>> they don't congratulate me on

The great scene, they say "what

About the baby."

>> Jimmy: What about the baby?

>> what can you say?

>> Jimmy: How many kids can

Angelina Jolie adopt?

You can't just --

[ laughter ]

Daniel, every boat you're on

Exploded it seems like.

>> yeah, it's true.

Every season, I seem to be on a

Boat and --

>> and it explodes.

>> it explodes or we lose

Children, something.

>> Jimmy: Something terrible

Happens.

Something terrible has happened

Really to all of the characters.

How many times do you think you

Were beaten as Ben Linus?

>> how many episodes was I in?

>> Jimmy: And just double it?

>> it was a lot.

>> Jimmy: There was a lot of

Beating.

>> more than most TV characters.

>> Jimmy: Were you disliked

Personally on the set?

Why all the beatings?

[ laughter ]

>> I'm happy to say I never saw

A glimmer of relish in anyone's

Eye when they were coming after

Me.

>> except me.

>> Jimmy: Uh-oh.

All right.

Well, we'll be back with more

With the cast.

Also tell you how you can get

Your very own piece of the

Island including delicious boxed

Lasagna as our "aloha to lost"

Continues.

[ cheers and applause ]

>> Jimmy: If you want to hold a

Piece of "lost" history this

Summer they'll be an auction

Online where you can bid on such

Items as Walt's flash comic book

In espanol.

You can get one of Locke's

Knifes.

A box of Dharma initiative

Lasagna.

Go to profilesinhistory.Com and

Register.

All the proceeds go to charity.

Let's meet the rest of the

Castaways.

Please welcome them.

[ cheers and applause ]

Welcome, everyone.

I think we should start probably

With the -- maybe the biggest

Question for nester, are you or

Are you not wearing eye liner?

>> I was in a book store about a

Month ago with my wife and my

Kids and -- you know, just in

Line.

I feel this presence behind me.

I hear this man say, wow, those

Really are natural.

[ laughter ]

And I turn around.

At first I thought he was

Talking about my wife.

And then I realized he's looking

At me.

I said thank you.

>> Jimmy: That's right.

People don't realize you're

One-quarter raccoon and hence --

[ laughter ]

Jeremy, I heard that somebody

Pulled a prank on you as far

As -- regarding this appearance

On the show?

>> indeed.

>> Jimmy: What did they tell you

Was going to happen?

>> I'm devastated.

Because it's not happening.

>> Jimmy: Yeah, tell everyone

What it was.

I'd like to know who told you

This too.

>> I heard from somebody -- that

There was going to be strip

Poker and a snowball fight.

>> Jimmy: Snowball fight.

>> and I rehearsed, man.

It's all I prepared.

>> Jimmy: Are you often the

Victim of little practical jokes

Like that?

You really believe there's going

To be a snowball fight here?

>> I did.

>> Jimmy: Don't worry, there

Will be no snowballs.

Michael, first of all, Harold,

I'm sorry, I'm calling you

Michael.

>> everybody does it, all the

Time.

I don't know.

>> Jimmy: Just change it to

Michael.

>> I might as well.

>> Jimmy: Michael's a nice name.

Friends can call you Mike.

>> okay.

>> Jimmy: First of all, thank

You for killing Ana Lucia.

[ applause ]

So --

>> no, no.

>> Jimmy: Your character did

Some bad things.

>> yes.

>> Jimmy: You weren't in the

Church.

>> right.

>> Jimmy: Where do you think

Michael is?

>> well, I think, you know, that

We answered that.

Michael's -- he's stuck on the

Island.

>> Jimmy: Still roaming on the

Island?

>> with the other people, just

Whispering to people.

For the rest of -- for eternity,

Whispering.

It sucks.

>> Jimmy: You're sentenced to

Muttering.

>> exactly.

>> Jimmy: And what do people say

To you when they meet Charles

Widmore?

Just you walking out here I got

Nervous.

>> nothing.

>> Jimmy: Nothing at all?

>> which is very nice.

>> Jimmy: Sure.

In Australia, you play like a

Very friendly TV dad?

>> yeah, I was Australia's

Favorite dad for many years.

>> Jimmy: See, you go from being

Like australia's bill co

>> to Charles Widmore.

>> Jimmy: Who at the end, maybe

He was redeemed somewhat as

Well.

Would you agree with that?

>> I wish you hadn't asked me

That question.

I still don't know if he's a

Good guy or a bad guy.

>> Jimmy: I think there are a

Lot of blurry lines as far as

Who's good and who's bad on the

Show.

>> yeah.

>> Jimmy: But you were pretty

Bad.

>> well, I thought it was fun.

>> Jimmy: Harold, what happened

To Walt?

He's 8 feet tall now, right?

>> he's 8 feet tall and dating

And -- I don't -- that's what

Happened to him.

>> Jimmy: So it's his fault

Because he had to go and grow

That you weren't on the show

That much.

>> well, yeah, sort of.

Maybe.

>> Jimmy: You got to give these

Kid cigarettes.

I told them Gary Coleman, I did.

>> they were hoping for Gary

Coleman but it didn't work out

That way.

He actually grew.

>> Jimmy: When we come back, we

Have something very special.

We have some of the alternate

Endings to the show.

First, before we do that, let's

Take a quick look back at the

Tender moments from "lost."

?

? I get lost in your eyes ?

? and I feel my spirits rise ?

? and like the wind ?

? is it love that I am in ?

>> ow!

Executive producers Damon

Lindelof and Carlton cuse.

They claim they have known how

Castaway on this crazy island.

There was a polar bear and -- a

Guy who turned into smoke.

>> Bob.

This doesn't work either.

>> Carlton thinks he's seen it.

Famous final shows in all of
