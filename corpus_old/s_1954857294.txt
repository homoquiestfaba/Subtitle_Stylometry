<i>It's not that last</i>

Pul

pulled the pin

on a grenade, threw it

in his commander's tent, 101st.

That was before the war even

started yet.

I'm tellin' ya,

we're our own worst enemy.

This Hummer misses me by

just...

They like to--we called it

the death blossom,

because they would just

basically go in a circle

and just start spraying.

People start getting

into a panic even when nothing's

into a panic even when nothing's

going on.

You got that shot shy.

How about I haven't gotten

a phone call, a letter,

an e-mail.

I've got nothing

from my chain of command.

They don't know whether I'm

alive or dead,

and you know what?

They don't give a fuck whether

I'm alive or dead!

And we have kids,

more kids going,

killing, "high-tech" killing

now, what's the difference?

It's still killing.

I think that the most

important thing is to--

Is to try to assimilate that

is to try to assimilate that

feeling of safety...

Outside.

Try to take it out of here.

I fought my fucking ass off

in that country for them!

You know that they did?

They fucking forgot about me.

They don't give a shit about me!

You know that?!

Jesus.

Good talking.

That there is good talking.

Thank you fellas, yeah?

Until next time.

Until next time.

Seriously, thanks, man.

Thanks, brother.

Well done.

Thank you, staff sergeant.

Thanks for that.

What's up, Drake?

See, that's was a classic

see, that's was a classic

example of opening up,

which is really the whole point

here is to open up,

preferably in front of everyone

else.

It's part of the group

dynamic.

Come on, Drake. I'm late.

Gotta be someplace,

and I got a splitting headache.

I get those, too.

Yeah, well, they're nasty.

That headache is a, uh,

is an outlet, right?

Because you need an outlet.

Yah know, that's--that's--

That's the nature of pain.

It expresses itself.

Since you're not voicing it...

It keeps me up at night.

It's like it's--

Like it's trying to make sure

I don't forget.

I don't forget.

Well, forget it, 'cause

you're not gonna forget,

like, ever, you know?

You're not gonna forget.

You just gotta find your peace.

There you go. That's an outlet.

Yeah, why not?

That did help.

That does feel--do another one.

You're not listening to me.

Whoa.

Whoa, big guy.

Drake!

Give me a smoke, will ya?

Aahhhhhh!

Drake!

Drake!

You're up.

How's cab 902 looking?

How's cab 902 looking?

902 it is.

How you doin' there, Drake?

You all right?

Um, go make some money

out there, okay?

You're cute for a cabbie.

You know, if you weren't black,

I'd probably fuck you.

I'm not a racist, I just don't

fuck black men anymore.

That leaves us on track for

September delivery, which--

Which leaves me a satisfied man,

that's right.

You know, this pussy's

too special for a black dick.

You just tell--you tell all your

you just tell--you tell all your

brothers that.

<i>For today, a high-level talk</i>

<i>designed to end the war</i>

<i>in Afghanistan.</i>

<i>They came a day before the</i>

<i>conflict begins its tenth year.</i>

<i>The Washington post reported...</i>

How you doin', cabbie?

I just made a $2 million sale.

How does that make you feel?

Would you go back

to the news?

<i>The Washington post</i>

<i>reported the Afghan government</i>

<i>is secretly engaged in</i>

<i>conversations with Taliban...</i>

I could tell you how it makes.

I could tell you how it makes

me feel.

How's that?

Like I could

buy and sell you.

I'm not even trying

to fuck anyone right now.

It's just not worth the drama.

<i>Ultimately an arrangement,</i>

<i>you know, done by</i>

<i>the Afghan government,</i>

<i>we support it.</i>

I can't listen to that.

Sorry.

You can't listen to what's

going on in the world?

I know what's going on.

Sam?

Hey, Sam!

Some men were looking for you.

Who?

I don't know.

They were really serious.

Who were they?

What'd they want?

They knew a lot about you.

I don't know.

You told them which room

I was in?

Why'd you do that, Carol?

Why'd you do that, Carol?

I didn't want to.

I'm sorry.

Why'd you do that??

I'm sorry!

Did they take your stuff?

No.

They didn't take anything.

What'd they want, then?

I don't know.

Tell me what they looked like.

They looked serious.

See that stare he's got?

I guarantee you he's

seen things that you and I

couldn't even imagine.

But if you were to imagine...

Mm-hmm.

I'd say they saw some

pretty heavy-duty shit

in that little village outside

of fallujah back in '05.

Yo, hold up, Drake, Drake!

We're the good guys.

We work for the company.

We work for the company.

Come on, get back in the car.

I actually admired

the initiative you took

that day.

Thank you.

Why were you at my place?

Your place?

That motel room?

Your place is with us.

Not anymore.

Hey, we never judged you

for anything you did.

Give us credit for that,

all right?

What I did was a crime.

Look, you know what?

You are a shining star.

You were the best we had.

I mean, answer me this, what is

this <i>driving miss Daisy</i>

bullshit?

And how does a soldier--

Fuck that, how does any man

resign himself

to living in this filth?

Because I'm a mercenary,

the filthy kind,

the kind your company makes.

The kind your company makes.

Well, this ain't about

the company, okay?

Right now this is about

your men,

because something from the past

has come back to haunt us.

Let us take you to dinner.

Three days ago,

our chief financial officer

was gunned down in the street

in broad daylight.

We have no claim on it.

There's no motive, no suspects.

And then yesterday,

and then yesterday,

we got a letter from a sergeant

Devon Carter.

He's a marine corp sniper.

That name ring a bell?

No.

Okay,

it didn't with us either,

but according

to sergeant Carter,

he was in the village that day,

and he saw everything go down.

That's not possible.

It was just us.

Well, apparently not.

And apparently this has been

eating at the good sergeant's

conscience for quite some time

now.

And somehow, killing my c.F.O.

Is a remedy for something,

I don't know.

He killed him?

That's what it says

in the letter.

What the fuck?

Seems he was on a mission

we didn't know about to take out

a target in that village.

Had a bird's-eye view of the

whole square when your squad

pulled into town for clean-up.

Didn't like what he saw.

Now...

He wants to tell people

about it.

About it.

Now we haven't given

the letter to the cops.

I'm sure you understand we

prefer to keep this

to ourselves.

What does he want?

See, that's the thing.

He wants to talk to you.

All right,

here is your chicken,

and there's your steak.

And there's your steak.

Anything else for you today?

What does he want me for?

We don't know.

But what we do know

is that you're the only one who

can help us resolve this

for good.

You mean kill him.

We mean resolve.

Yeah, well, I'm not

yeah, well, I'm not

resolving anything.

This is your dirty laundry.

Drake, you were the one

giving the orders that day,

so I'm sure he's gonna name

you first,

and I'm sure that's why he's

calling you out,

so the least you could do

for yourself, the very least

you could do for your men,

who are out there right now,

trying to lead some semblance of

an ordinary life.

Don't fuck them.

Don't fuck them.

Look,

everything you need

is right in there.

Go to hell.

Hey, Drake.

Hold up a sec.

Hey, you remember Ron linin?

What'd it take,

about three weeks

before he hung himself?

What about Tyson?

Jumping off that bridge in the

jumping off that bridge in the

middle of rush-hour traffic?

He even killed that

woman on the way down.

Are you sure you want this

to resurface?

Don't leave your men

out to dry again, lieutenant.

I'm not saying yes

to anything.

We're confident you'll

come to the right conclusion.

Come to the right conclusion.

This is about saving lives,

so stop that shit in your head.

Be ready in 48 hours, okay?

You ever kill anyone?

I sign the mission orders.

Nobody gets a pass.

I hear they call you

"the fireman."

<i>A child grows up,</i>

You're in my chair.

Sorry to wake you up.

That's all right.

I was already awake,

sort of.

It's not the hour I mind.

It's not the hour I mind.

That's why I give you guys keys,

so you can come down here

anytime you need.

What I do mind is that

you bring me down here

and you can't look me in the eye

and tell me what's going on.

I won't be at group...

For a little.

Okay.

That's all.

I'm sorry.

I just won't be here.

Yeah, I got that.

Could anyone have done...

Could anyone have done what?

Could anyone have done

any better?

Done any better with what?

What makes what I did wrong?

I mean,

it was wrong,

but...

Look, there's nothing right

look, there's nothing right

about what they asked us to do.

You gotta remember that.

I did bad things, marsh,

really bad things.

We did what we were told.

Don't make us bad people.

Nobody asked us to like it.

Then what?

What do we do with those things?

We live with it.

We live with ourselves.

We live with ourselves.

We make peace with the fact that

we did the best we could with

the training we had.

The war is over, Drake,

and you gotta stop fighting.

That's what I keep telling all

you guys, is that you're home

now, and you just gotta stop.

You just gotta.

This is 15 miles of river

from the target, and we're

two days from the river.

It'll give you some time

to meditate on the stakes

at hand, lieutenant.

When you hit the water,

there'll be a small boat launch

about a mile or so down,

an old forest service thing.

Find something there

to get you down the river.

Fuck this.

Oh, one more thing,

lieutenant,

and this is from the top.

Not a goddamn trace.

And bring proof.

Not a goddamn trace, lieutenant.

Not a goddamn trace, lieutenant.

<i>This world's got</i>

<i>a darkness to it,</i>

<i>got a nasty stench</i>

<i>that follows it around,</i>

<i>got a hopelessness,</i>

<i>in its rule book,</i>

<i>talking about how no one here</i>

<i>talking about how no one here</i>

<i>gets out alive.</i>

<i>So seems like everyone here</i>

<i>just stays inside instead,</i>

<i>going mad.</i>

<i>No one sees it,</i>

<i>but then they send you away,</i>

<i>over there,</i>

<i>out there,</i>

<i>out of here.</i>

<i>And you come back,</i>

<i>if you come back,</i>

<i>you see everyone's</i>

<i>out of their damn minds.</i>

<i>Out of their damn minds.</i>

<i>And they call you the crazy one</i>

<i>for what you did over there.</i>

Ah, shit!

Oh, fuck!

Oh.

Forest?!

What kind of man fights

in anything

but the motherfuckin' desert?

Ah, shit!

Ahh!

Damn it, stop movin'.

You're the one who called me

out here, asshole!

And you're holding out

for motherfuckin' hide-and-seek.

Is that you, Carter?

Yeah, that's right.

How you doing, Drake?

You know what I told 'em

when they came to me for this?

When they came to me for this?

Told 'em I'm too old

for this shit.

Yeah, you were

probably right.

Now listen,

with your left hand,

take hold of your rifle,

with your right,

grab the pistol

and put them both on the ground,

slowly.

You got me.

I called bullshit on this

from the beginning.

No bullshit about it.

We got a lot to talk about,

you and me.

Just put the guns on the ground.

Just put the guns on the ground.

I'm not gonna kill you.

Well, those two guns

you're holdin' say differently,

and I will kill you if you don't

put them on the ground now.

Good.

Good.

Now turn around,

slowly.

Drop the pack.

Don't be defiant.

Drop the pack.

Lieutenant Drake.

You're a little taller

in person.

So you got some kind

of grudge, right?

What the fuck do I have

to do with your grudge?

I don't even know you.

Oh, we met

from 1,000 yards away,

from 1,000 yards away,

but I saw you.

You didn't see shit.

I saw you through my glass,

me and my scout,

my buddy binder,

met you over there,

rounding up all those villagers

in the square.

Yeah, well I never met you.

Slow down.

Why don't you fuck yourself

and tell me what your goddamn

problem is?

You were busy.

Whole time,

you didn't look human.

Something had you.

How were you in the perimeter

and we didn't know anything

about you?

About you?

I was like a bird,

had a real nice nest, too,

had a target that was probably

the same man you were looking

for, only I actually had the

intel to know where he was.

There was a warehouse pumping

out I.E.D.S,

so they sent me in to weed out

the one running it,

and I had him cornered,

finally,

until you motherfuckers showed

up and just killed

everything in sight,

except, of course,

for the target.

We got ambushed!

They were hiding the perps!

And I was solving

the problem.

What the hell do you want

what the hell do you want

about it now?

What do I want?

Well, me and binder watched when

you lit that poor bastard

on fire.

Coldest shit I've ever seen.

And the whole time your head's

right in my crosshairs.

Binder's giving me readings and

we're both thinking this piece

of shit deserves to die

right now.

Couldn't believe you.

What kind of soldier does shit

like that?!

I had my finger on the trigger,

ready to pull,

but I didn't,

but I didn't,

couldn't.

But right in that moment,

lieutenant, with you in my

sights, I got real on something,

that this shit isn't about you

or me.

They make us this way.

They're the ones that deserve

to get it.

No one needs to get it.

Don't tell me you didn't

deserve to die that day.

It's not about deserving it.

Mm.

You still came for me, though.

I told you,

I'm not gonna kill you.

No.

You're not.

You do what you have to do.

And if it's gonna come anyway,

why don't you get on killing me?

You were on the street for what,

a year, after five years of

combat?

Barely scraping by now, right?

Like so many of our brothers.

What do you suppose is left

for me to kill?

You see, what's a bullet

to your head gonna do

but save you, brother?

You live here?

Yeah.

Like it?

Don't worry.

It's just the elevation

fucking with you.

Fucking with you.

Ugh.

You get used to it.

Here.

Ahh.

Ugh.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

Mi casa, su casa.

What the hell are you

doing up here?

What is this place?

Used to be

a fire-watch cabin.

Paid men to come up here

and pay attention.

Guess I'm continuing

a tradition, then.

Next time,

keep me out of it.

I would've asked the same

of you in that village.

Fuck you.

Drake, I don't have

a grudge against you,

not at all.

And the executive?

I did have a grudge

against him,

against him,

and that's what you'd look like

if I didn't consider you

a friend.

I feel like we've known

each other for a long time.

I want you to join me.

I want us to work together.

We can do great things,

you and me.

I'm not the man for the job.

Don't you fuck with me.

You know I've seen what

your capable of.

What I'm capable of

is bullshit.

This is bullshit!

This is bullshit!

What the fuck

do you want from me?

I'm paying my dues.

I don't gotta answer

to this shit from you!

Look at you.

This is how they make us suffer.

We gotta put an end

to this shit, Drake.

You're out

of your fuckin' mind.

You drag me out here

to this shit hole to what?

To play out some little game?

Yes!

Exactly.

It's been a game from the

beginning, but up until now,

we've been the pawns.

Shit, Carter.

You think we're ever gonna be

you think we're ever gonna be

anything but a bunch

of fuckin' pawns?

That's in the job description.

You have me, Carter!

What's your play?

What's it gonna be?

My play?

Well...

I'm gonna cut your ropes.

But if you try to escape,

but if you try to escape,

I will kill you,

and when I do, you'll be

thinking about this moment right

now, and I won't even have to

say "I told you so."

Besides...

There's something you and I

have to do right now,

and I wouldn't feel right

doing it with such an advantage.

See what we have to do is clear

the air a little bit.

Now don't try anything tricky.

Aah!

My buddy binder took it

pretty hard witnessing

your little outrage over there.

Motherfucker!

So call that one for him.

Aah!

And that's for my target in

that village that you

compromised and fucked up

my percentage.

And that...

Well, that's just to make sure

you get it back.

You know, you almost got me

in that clear-cut, Drake!

Those bullets were whizzing

right over my head!

Right over my head!

My good luck, I guess,

your bad, 'cause, well,

here we are.

You ain't gonna shoot...

You aren't gonna--

You ain't gonna shoot me,

are you?

You gonna shoot me?

Aah!

You motherfuckers don't care!

You motherfuckers don't care!

We fuckin' killed each other.

You don't give...

Fuck!

I'm sorry!

Nobody fuckin' cares!

The first time I killed,

I was on the target

for two weeks before I engaged.

They tell you you're

gonna vomit or something

or have nightmares

or be conflicted.

That's what they say anyway.

They also say that the only way

they also say that the only way

to get rid of it

is to kill again.

But those are the cynics.

I didn't have any of that.

That target I engaged,

that man I killed,

was a soldier.

We were in a match.

I won.

God understands that.

Cheap shot motherfucker.

Cheap shot motherfucker.

Did you hear

what I was saying?

People get caught up

in the semantics

but don't like to see things

clearly for what they are.

They want to argue about

interpretations but not about

what's true.

There's no morality,

not in language.

You can justify

anything with words.

What the fuck are you

talking about?

Is that all you do up here?

Is that all you do up here?

Talk to your damn self.

I'm talking to you,

lieutenant.

Better listen.

Ahh.

I'm going back to sleep.

Uh-huh.

All right.

But what do you know

anyway?

You're a goddamn contractor.

I'm a fucking marine.

Maybe you started out

maybe you started out

as a marine,

but you ended up

a fuckin' mercenary.

What if I said yes?

Yes to what?

Yes, I'll join you.

What did you tell me?

You haven't told me yet.

Say yes first.

What if I did?

What's your plan?

You don't even know, do you?

You don't even know, do you?

What you're doing

up here,

you're killing some businessman.

It's a world of shit

you're in for this.

Are we gonna be like

that D.C. sniper?

Posting up in a trunk

somewhere shooting soccer moms?

See, that man

had no imagination.

All the career criminals in D.C.

And the only people he finds

to kill are innocents?

You got it worked out, right?

How we're gonna be different

how we're gonna be different

than him.

See, I bet he had a plan, too.

I bet he planned on all sorts of

things coming together, but in

the end, he was just a crazy

motherfucker with good aim.

He was a vet, too.

What other country's

gonna make a man like that?

You're right. It made you.

All of man's problems stems

from his inability to sit by

himself alone in an empty room.

Himself alone in an empty room.

Man, your shooters

are a strange breed.

Then again, what might be

the problem is we keep building

all these empty rooms.

Real fuckin' strange.

My buddy, binder...

He couldn't handle what he saw

over there.

Blew his brains out

the night he got back

to Georgia.

To Georgia.

But he didn't just kill himself.

He killed his wife,

his two kids,

then himself.

What could make a man do that?

You just see a bunch

of random words.

But look closer.

There's a pattern.

There's a pattern to everything.

I don't see it.

I don't either yet.

But that's the work

but that's the work

of the whole thing, it's there.

What's that?

That, my friend,

is a kill hole.

There was a native people

in the southwest,

membray, tribe of Potters.

Made the most beautiful,

perfect pots there were.

Perfect pots there were.

But before they died,

they killed their pots.

Cut a hole in the center

of each one.

The hole released the spirit of

the Clay so it could join them

in the next world.

Kill their pots?

Looks to me like you drew a big

fucking circle on some paper.

That circle,

that space there,

that hole,

that's the mystery.

That's the place that was there

before the words were.

That's where they come from.

That's where they come from.

That's where they go.

It's where everything falls out.

It's where you and I go

when we're done here.

The kill hole.

You get the view tonight!

â™ª Mama, mama â™ª

I knew you didn't have it

in ya.

I told you I wasn't gonna

kill ya.

Thought you was just

sweet-talkin' me.

The knife was the one,

I knew it, I knew it.

That was the test.

You did good.

You did good!

How'd I know you were

gonna say that?

The truth is,

you don't have much

of a choice about killing me,

you know that, right?

You know that, right?

Is it just me,

or is that what you want?

You go back empty-handed,

they'll kill you.

But hell,

maybe they kill you

one way or the other.

Thing is...

I'm not going back empty-handed.

I'm really not gonna kill you,

but...

But...

It's worse than that,

'cause I'm gonna need proof

that I did.

Sorry, Carter.

There's no other way.

You already disappeared.

Why would you leave here?

This is where you want to be.

It's not your fault,

Drake.

You had to do it.

You had to do it.

Just tell me

you're gonna disappear.

Tell me you're not gonna

kill anymore.

I forgive you.

We were outside of Baghdad,

and for some reason,

and for some reason,

an old woman on the sidewalk

had caught my attention,

and I'm watching, and like

we were saying before

about the I.E.D.S,

you get that tingle,

you know something's coming,

like, right before it happens.

And I'm getting that tingle,

and I'm watching this old woman,

and something is just wrong.

And she reaches down,

and she's reaching down

to the ground, and it looks like

she's grabbing the bottom

the bottom of her burka,

and she proceeds to pull it up

and take a huge dump

on the sidewalk, and I just,

on the sidewalk, and I just,

I've never been the same

ever since.

Every time I see an old lady,

I just, I pray that

please,

please wait!

We talk a lot about

the negative stuff,

but camaraderie,

you know,

having your friends

and other soldiers

be your family

and having these people with you

that have your back,

like, I mean, more than

you can ever imagine,

that's one of the things I miss

about the military.

We were always bonded

together because of a conflict

together because of a conflict

that brought us together.

I don't have the same

connections to them

that I did.

The military

was that connection.

And so that bond that

we had then and that support

that we felt and that gave us

the strength is gone.

We're standing alone now!

My first time in combat,

kandahar,

I shit my pants.

Piss,

shit,

the whole works,

the whole works,

just shootin' at nothin',

scared as fuck,

covered in shit.

You know, what the recruiter

won't tell you,

what they don't want you

to know,

you have to shed a lot of pride

to do what we do.

You can think you're all type

of man, but until you're in

a firefight, until you've

been there, you don't know what

you're made of, you don't know

you're made of, you don't know

shit about yourself,

but it's the funnest

damn thing you ever experience.

I wouldn't trade it for nothing.

Do you ever leave this thing?

Just to come in here.

Got any ladies in your life?

Got any ladies in your life?

That's a negative also, sir.

Do you think, by chance,

these two things are connected?

Probably, sir.

You know, that was a good talk

in there tonight.

Thanks.

No, I mean that.

I know, I know.

Feels good, doesn't it?

Feels good, doesn't it?

Maybe.

Yeah, it does.

All right.

You know, the thing

about opening up,

you finally spill...

Hey, hey, hey,

enough of that man.

You keep me talkin',

I'm gonna cut on the meter.

What do you want, taxi cab

confessions up in here?

What are you

bending my ear for anyway?

Don't you think I got

things to do? Get outta here.

How you doin', 902?

This thing still runnin'?

Yeah.

Stuck me with this piece of shit

stuck me with this piece of shit

again.

<i>What could I tell you,</i>

<i>my friend, that you don't</i>

<i>already know?</i>

<i>Is there any combination</i>

<i>of words</i>

<i>that I could surprise you</i>

<i>with?</i>

<i>Would you believe me anyway</i>

<i>if I did?</i>

Guy came by the other day

looking for ya, left you this.

Looking for ya, left you this.

Said he was a friend of yours.

Friend of mine?

Yeah.

<i>I was inspired by all</i>

<i>your tales of loneliness</i>

<i>out here on the streets,</i>

<i>inspired enough to find out</i>

<i>for myself.</i>

<i>So it's no surprise to tell you</i>

<i>how lonely I am.</i>

<i>I don't mind telling you that.</i>

<i>I'll tell you, too,</i>

<i>how scared I was my first night</i>

<i>out here,</i>

<i>how fear is the only thing you</i>

<i>can see in the city at night.</i>

<i>The screaming,</i>

<i>the dirt,</i>

<i>the hunger,</i>

<i>the jackals,</i>

<i>the jackals,</i>

<i>sick with blood,</i>

<i>a sickness</i>

<i>no army could destroy.</i>

<i>The shadows,</i>

<i>but you know about them, right?</i>

<i>How they covered your light?</i>

<i>How they eat up</i>

<i>what's good in the world.</i>

<i>Then when they're done,</i>

<i>there's nothing to show for it</i>

<i>there's nothing to show for it</i>

<i>but their darkness,</i>

<i>taking all the light...</i>

<i>Putting out the flame...</i>

<i>Drawing attention</i>

<i>to themselves.</i>

<i>You didn't want these kind</i>

<i>of decisions to make.</i>

<i>But here I am</i>

<i>fucking that all up.</i>

<i>Fucking that all up.</i>

<i>You understand that this</i>

<i>is the only move I have.</i>

<i>This is my burden.</i>

<i>This is my god I'm mad at.</i>

<i>And you,</i>

<i>what's that you said once?</i>

<i>We're all just pawns?</i>

<i>You're right.</i>

<i>But pawns</i>

<i>but pawns</i>

<i>win the wars.</i>

<i>Carry this burden, lieutenant.</i>

<i>Finish this war.</i>

<i>Open your heart.</i>

<i>Come back home, and find me.</i>

Come on, marsh.

Pick up, pick up, pick up,

pick up, pick up, pick up,

pick up.

Ugh!

Shit!

Why do you have a gun, Sam?

Why do you have a gun, Sam?

It's nothing.

Are you in trouble again?

I don't got time to clean up,

so if you could just

throw any of this stuff away,

give it away.

Sam,

what are you talking about?

What are you doing?

If anyone comes,

just tell them I left.

You don't know where,

I just left.

I'm not telling anyone

anything, it's okay.

You can stay with me.

It's okay.

I need to go.

Thanks.

Ugh!

Into the bathroom. Be quiet.

Now.

Go, girl.

Go, girl.

I'm all right.

Lieutenant Drake,

we need to have

a very long conversation.

I'm disappointed.

Aren't we all?

The Drake of myth and lore

in our company

is a cold, calculating,

finely tuned killing machine.

But now, Drake,

by all appearances,

by all appearances,

you're just a man,

a coward at that.

Here's a man that's apt to be

without the proper guidance.

We did give you the guidance.

I don't even know

who you are.

Ughhh!

I'd find that surprising

if I didn't know you went

from our company

to living under a bridge,

then to driving frat boys

then to driving frat boys

and hookers around for pennies.

I'm sure there's plenty

that passed you by.

That was the idea.

Ugh!

Aah!

Aah.

This is Mr. Stanford hull.

He's our company's founder.

And I'm here,

because my chief executive,

Peter krebbs,

was just murdered,

and I hold you

personally responsible for that.

Personally responsible for that.

Krebbs was the other one.

Yes, the other one.

You were a bum

on the street, is that right?

We did give you a second chance

in life, correct?

You did provide an ear,

Mr. Drake,

as evidence of your services.

Now what happened?

I can't tell you that.

I can't tell you that.

Oh!

Lie to me, Mr. Drake,

tell me this whole thing

is a figment

of my imagination,

that when I call my number one

krebbs on his cell phone,

he's gonna answer as always,

because he's alive and well.

Can you tell me that?

No you can't, can you?

What do you want?

You're gonna tell me

where Carter is.

Can't do that.

Krebbs gave you money which

is my money and I'd like to see

is my money and I'd like to see

a return on it.

Did you even find Carter?

Did you look?

Or did the two of you

go brokeback out there?

Is that what this is about?

If I knew where he was,

I'd kill him myself.

That's doubtful.

Get the spare.

Why don't you tell me

what happened out there?

I don't want anything

to do with you.

Where is he?

I'm not killing anyone

for you.

That is the problem here.

Too late, Drake.

That's right.

Too fucking late.

Too fucking late.

Get the can.

Crazy sons of bitches.

Gaaaahhhhhhh!

You outta your fuckin' mind!

Aahhhhhh!

Aahhhhhh!

Beautiful method here

you developed, Drake.

You remember this, don't you?

Karma does travel

internationally.

I thought everyone knew that.

You can't run from it.

You can't run from it.

It meets you wherever you go.

Looks like I forgot

my most important tool.

Now, Mr. Drake,

this is the last time.

We need to know where Carter is,

and you need to tell us.

I'm not telling you shit.

It's a shame we couldn't

it's a shame we couldn't

have come to some understanding.

Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

I'm no animal, lieutenant.

You were next.

It's true.

Look in my jacket pocket.

It's all there.

I didn't realize

our shooter was so eloquent.

Our shooter was so eloquent.

He's at the fire tower.

Same place.

He wants me to kill him.

I know what I've gotta do,

so let me do it.

Not for you.

I just need to make a stop

first.

Five minutes, Drake.

All I'm sayin' is that you

got some shit to deal with,

because you're hiding out

at home,

and you come down here

to hide out

so no one sees you,

and then you come in here

and you say you feel invisible.

And you say you feel invisible.

Well, yeah, of course you do.

I mean, that's just something

I think we gotta look at.

Hey.

What the hell happened to you?

What happened to you?

Come here, sit down.

Hey, whoa.

Shh, it's all right.

Sit down.

What happened?

Who did this to you?

Who did this to you?

I did this. I did it.

I did this. I did it.

All right.

Why don't you just sit down?

I can't--I can't stay.

What's this?

My brother.

You remember?

Can you give this to him?

Yeah.

Yeah.

All right. I will.

Can you sit down for me?

I can't sit down now.

There are people outside

waiting for me.

Wait, you mean

the people who did this to you,

they're outside?

They're outside?

They're outside right now?

It's all right.

They're gonna

help make it right.

Don't fuck with me, Drake.

It's okay.

I just wanted to say thank you.

Thank you for just being there.

Can you please just get this

to my brother?

Yeah.

I'm gonna do that.

All right?

I'm gonna do that

in about five minutes.

Marsh!

Marsh.

Marsh.

What is this?

What, what do you want?

The private sec--

The private sector.

You're private sector.

You didn't tell me

you were a fucking mercenary.

That's what this is about?

Marsh.

You forgot to mention that one,

you fucking animals!

You wanna fight

for the corporations?

Go be a goddamn security guard!

You leave this boy alone!

I've been trying to leave

'em, I got shit to clean up!

That's why they're here!

All right.

I ain't got shit to do

with them after this.

Mm-hmm.

The war's over.

Ain't that right, marsh?

The war's over.

No!

Okay, okay.

Drake?

What is it?

I knew you'd come.

You're my friend.

You're my friend.

Fuck you, Carter.

You almost got me killed.

I knew I'd see you again.

Turn around.

Turn around, goddamn it.

I'm not shootin' you

in the back.

In the back.

It'll be better.

It'll be better next time.

All of this'll be gone.

Leave this shit behind.

Leave this shit behind.

It's better that way.

You know that feeling,

that feeling

when it's all clear?

I can see it.

I can see it all now.

No more words, Carter.

No praise. No blame.

No blame, lieutenant!

This is it.

This is it.

This is all there is,

and that's okay.

That's okay.

This...

Is it!
