Arlen Faber doesn't do interviews.

He's refusing audience

<i> Can you imagine how much
that would change you?

<i> He is not even like us anymore.

<i> He has no concern for
worldly affairs or possessions.

<i> He has been touched by the divine and
he is giving us the only thing that he could.

<i> Which is Me and God.

<i> And if that is not enough for you

<i> then God help you.

feel better. 

For my sake. 

And a legend was born. 

Advances that have a talent 
if not shared? 

Glad we 
that in common. 

The incredible chiropractic. 

The incredible ... 

Writer thoughts 
outer space. 

Tell me about Alexander. 

Alex. 
He hates Alexander. Alex. 

He is one amazing kid. 

He keeps me up 
just to be near. 

How often 
He sees the Father? 

He does not see his father 
3years ago. 

What happened? 

Alex's father was ... 

One of those guys 
who always has a good idea. 

And for a time, 

this idea was us. 

Then one day, 
He took Alex to the park 

and said he needed 
go away for a while 

but again 
in 2weeks. 

Weeks. 

And in the end was 3years. 

Alex was so small 
I hope ... 

he has forgotten. 

Mean, 
I should have guessed. 

No! 

-Okay? 
-Shit! 

Do not move. 

If you do not stop playing 
this song 

I cut my wrists. 

Where were we? 

"I think I bored ... 
-No, no. 

Sorry. 

It's a nice place, 
'm ruining everything. 

No, I'm listening. 

He is listening. 

What do you hear? 

Want to hear what I'm anxious, 
I do not do enough? 

I lose control 
all the time? 

I'm afraid not 
doing enough and that fear 

me into something that did not return 
I want to be and can not stop. 

No idea how 
be pressed all the time. 

Not for Alex, but the idea 
that I am not enough. 

He knows. 

And he wants you to know is 
enough and more. 

You are here for God 
can experience the world 

through their eyes. 

See what you see. 
Feel what you feel. 

Every day, He can not wait 
to see what you will do. 

What makes you laugh, what moves you. 
He can hardly wait. 

Every day, through you, 
He falls in love with the world. 

Elizabeth, you are 
His muse. 

<i> Thanks. 

Nossa, que lindo! 

Yes, it is. 

I bet that gives 
huge party here. 

No one was here 
5years ago. 

Five years? 

Since 
my father died. 

Sorry. 

Me too. 

Do not touch that! 

I will not. 

Let me show you something. 

-This is my office. 
-I know, I saw the card. 

Why so many boards? 

Because my father had 
Alzheimer 

and at the end was difficult for him 
remembering things. 

Cards helped, 
for a while. 

I collect. 

My father and I watched 
monster movies together. 

When I put some 
was a child, and over time, 

get at garage sales or 
exhibitions of science fiction. 

I really like them. 
I think I have a beautiful collection. 

If you like that sort of thing. 
Perhaps not. 

Not everyone likes. It's kind of stupid. 
It is better to walk away. 

No, I loved it. 

-Sao wonderful. 
-Really? 

But it's crowded. 
Better get that here. 

Sure, there's room. 

Where you going? 

Ready. There is better. 

I do not want him there, 
I want him back with the others. 

Sure. Just give it a try. 
Consider as an experiment. 

Thanks for 
bring here. 

Caught me off guard 
today. 

Tell me ... 

I am the first girl to do 
their monsters? 

Sorry. 
Give me just a second. 

Do not run away. 

I am ruining everything 
again, is not it? 

Imagine. Love when 
I kiss someone 

and he leaves to protect 
the plastic toy. 

But I kiss better 
knowing that they are safe. 

I remember what it made me. 
Understand? 

It's just a choir, right? 
It's not about life or death. 

At one time, 
if someone left me aside, 

I isolated for 3days. 

Now? I pray in silence 
the death of them. 

Hi My name is Ross 
and I am an alcoholic. 

-Hello, Ross. 
-Hello, Ross. 

It seems our time is up, 
if nobody wants to say anything. 

And you? 

The beginner. 

Shall I say something? 

How about this? 

I hate that shit. 

I hate to be here. 

I hate you 
and their stories pathetic. 

I do not believe 
did I get here. 

That sucks. 

I'm in deep shit. 

And you are also. 

Look, I have a 
great plan. 

Let's go walking at night 
knocking down pedestrians. 

Playing back 
people on the ground. 

It is hard work, 
war needs soldiers. 

That looks great. 
When we? 

Good luck on the moon 
We always knew that I could. 

Thank you. 

I think he 
is safe. 

Goofing 
with my face? 

No, I'm enjoying with the face 
chair of the Inquisition. 

Once handle 
and make him confess. 

Keep it safe. 

-See you later. 
-Right. 

So how is this business 
of heaven and hell? 

I have seen hell. 
His name is Reno, Nevada. 

I do not believe that God 
punish people 

-for not believing in him. 
-The rapture. 

What is this? 

I like to think it 
as a movie monster. 

The monster destroys some 
and save others. 

And who is the monster? 

God. 

God is the monster. 

Chiropractic has made 
lately? 

<i> Sitting up, 
Treatment Center. 

As you 
as it straightens. 

"Impossible. 
Straightening-up. 

It was in chiropractic 
lately? 

What are you doing? 

Elizabeth said that we need 
attract customers. 

Nobody wants to talk 
with a spine. 

-Discount offer. 
-Spine? 

I do not care. 

-Spine? 
She makes you see here. 

Until next week, 
Mr. Macwan. 

It is a new business, 
need to advertise. 

It is helping 
the new business? 

Honey, how did that happen? 
Pick up. 

Hold on, Anne. I think we 
a saw-bones somewhere. 

Easy. 
'll Get you there. 

"You okay? 
"I'm going home. 

-Now? 
-That was not cool. 

Sorry. 
Go back? 

Want me to call 
later? 

What we do with you? 

-Can I take you to the park. 
No, that's fine. 

It is more complicated 
than you think. 

I think I can take 
a child to the park. 

-Good. Want to go? 
-I. 

Go to the park. Only the park, right? 
Beware. Have fun! 

Beware. 

Only the park. 
Have fun. 

I do not want a half-brother. 

Understood. 

In your home, you have 
preferred a towel? 

Yes. 

I can read 
upside down. 

I have something for you. 

It is my own 
means of transport ... 

Missions in the future. 

What are you waiting for? 
Go play. 

-I? 
Of course. 

-I have a favorite towel. 
-Me neither. 

-Kris, is not a good time. 
"My father died today. 

"My father died today. 
My God. 

Did not know where to go, 
Then I came here. 

Is not the usual time, can 
give me more books if you want. 

What? 
Nothing. 

-Kris, is not a good time. 
-I am thirsty. 

-Get something for him to drink. 
Of course. 

Thank you. 

So ... 

I met him when I 
home. 

Was sitting at the table 
doing crossword puzzles. 

He never does 
crossword. 

Kris has just come out 
rehabilitation. 

You okay? 

It is better not to talk. 
Let's be quiet here. 

What did you mean 
with "the most books? 

I have a 
small bookstore. 

"Book Exchange". 

-It was where I bought your book. 
-Perfect. 

Arlen tried to sell books, 
but I could not pay. 

He surtou. Now, I come here 
and return books by questions. 

Does he pay with books 
the questions? 

Fully-fair. 
No, it's horrible. 

Still not heard 
questions. 

Arlen, I can not feel anything. 
Nothing. 

I should feel something, 
not? 

Enjoys working 
in the bookstore? 

I love the bookstore. 

All those ideas by which 
bother to work hard. 

Could never 
do something. 

Rs Sometimes I'm in the middle of the store, 
night, 

imagining that all authors 
esta r me. 

I close my eyes and pretend that they are 
trying to tell me something. 

They are. Are saying 
"Give me your money". 

What else? 

What else would you like 
in the bookstore? 

I love that I feel 
safe, there. 

Except-what? 
I do not know. 

Know-yes. 
-No. 

Let. Saved from what? 

Except ... 

To be afraid 
all the time. 

All the time. 

I'm so tired. 

It is so tiring 
be afraid. 

My father died today. 

I know, honey. 

Sorry. 

-Okay? 
-Yes. 

Come to the office 
that week. Free consultation. 

I'm around. If you 
something may appear. 

Let's see. 

"You want to ... 
-I gotta go. 

Why when you are with me 
says amazing things, 

but when a boy 
loses his father and needs you, 

says nothing. 
Why? 

It's complicated. 

Really? I thought it was easy 
for Arlen Faber. 

Can you ... 

What? What, Arlen? 
What are you hiding? 

The time is up. 

You can not do that. 

I showed 
my monsters. 

You really Arlen Faber? 

I am not. 
And neither is Arlen Faber. 

Anne, I'm calling again. 
Sorry, I said I would not mind. 

I just want to apologize. 
Never again will use costumes. 

Just a minute. 

I promise, even 
on Halloween. If there is something ... 

When I saw that he was, 
agreed to help me, 

Since I do not tell 
anyone who he is. 

Why he does not want 
anyone know? 

I do not know. 

Perhaps because he needs to have 
answers, but it is a disaster. 

-It is his girlfriend? 
-No. 

And that was before I talk 
he hiding? 

No, but that did not help 

You like it? 

No matter. 

That's it. 

Step in the bookstore 
that week. 

You better hurry up. 
I may be going out of business. 

The first is free, 
then you should get. 

MY HEART LISTENING TE 

Hallo. 

<i> Hi, is Elizabeth. 

Linking to apologize? 

No. 
I need to ask a favor. 

Rumor Has It 
does not help anyone ... 

Anne is not here. 
I have a client, I am stuck. 

I have not heard the favor. 

I do not think I will ask this, 
but could pick up Alex at school 

and take you to your house? 
I'll pick it up later. 

And do not talk to anyone? 

-No conversation. 
-E said it was my brother. 

-You what? 
-I needed. 

Please just go get it 
and bring it back. 

<i> Just enter and exit. 

Catch him and bring him back, 
without talking. Understood. 

How are you, buddy? 

His mother asked me 
to come pick you up. 

Alexander came to pick up? 

Yes, Alex. 

-Must be his brother. 
-Right. 

Expected to find it today. 

Today is a day of reunion. 

She had a medical emergency, 
then I'll take Alex home. 

I fear that this may affect 
the entry of Alexander 

the advanced program. 

You can talk to me. 

After all, I am her brother. 

Sure. Okay. 

It will take just a minute. 

Go ahead. 

Crap. 

Good. 

I still 
do not know. 

'm Zebulon. 

Uncle Zebulon. 

Alexander. 

First, let me say 
is great to have him in the room. 

He is very creative 
and friend to all. 

If any of the other 
is hurt or upset, 

it is always the first 
to console them. 

He is very empathetic. 

And empathy is 
a good thing. 

-Good. 
"But in other areas ... 

Empathy, reading, friends. 
Is more what? 

Math. 

Are well behind the others. 
Problems with sum, 

while others have passed 
for multiplication. 

You're the teacher, should not 
find a way to teach it? 

I have 26students. 

I can devote my time 
integer to a single student, 

and Alexander must learn 
Our first lesson. 

AM RESPONSIBLE 
Prestat AM 

He is also ... 
How do I say that? 

-Immature. 
-He is 7years. 

Yes, but still makes jokes 
during the lessons. 

And Rs also times when 
are trying to be quiet. 

The other students must 
learn other lessons, 

but Alexander makes it 
difficult. 

"I think that Alexander ... 
-Let me interrupt. 

I'll tell you 
some things. 

All children develop 
different ways, 

different times 
and different directions. 

I'm sure Alex, 
at some point 

is going to do 
and mature. 

And we agree, 
I think that would be everything. 

I think not 
listening. 

What I'm hearing is 
that Alex is not a good candidate 

to be a robot 
in his army of clones. 

Zebulon! 

Let's work the math. 
Right? 

Meanwhile, why not try 
not make you feel 

to be himself 
is a problem? 

Was what happened between you and me. 
Been there? 

By the way, his name is Alex. 
He hates Alexander. 

I'm in trouble? 

I think the place 
instead. 

She said it 
a great kid. 

And should not make jokes 
when she speaks. 

-All right. 
-By the way ... 

If she asks, 
'm your Uncle Zebulon. Zebulon. 

It is a hybrid name. 
It means "exalted". 

What? 

My mother says that it has 
poison and can make you sick. 

And I say that if not 
the best sandwich you ever ate, 

I change my name to Denise 
and I set the sea. 

He is a good piano. 
-Yes, yes. 

-Can play? 
-A little. 

-Play something for me? 
-I prefer not. 

Why? 

He was my father and he died. 
And I remember him playing. 

He was legal? 

-Yes, he was. 
-Do you miss him? 

Yes, very necessary. 

Me too. 

Can I ask a question? 

How long 
2weeks? 

Okay. 
I do not know.

Hi, buddy. 
Wow, that It! 

Thank you for taking care of him. 
It will not happen again. 

No problem. 

-Bye, Arlen. 
-Bye. 

-Sorry for the levy. 
-We had fun. 

-Elizabeth. 
What? 

Nothing. 

Come here. Amused? 

Hamburgers <i>. 

Who thought <i> 
was a good idea? 

Kris, is there? 

<i> Go away. 

What's with the bottle? 

The funeral of my father 
was today. 

I was the one to go. 

I'm sure some 
not go. 

You said that the life of all 
moves to a purpose. 

Maybe my purpose 
is drinking. 

It was not what I meant. 

When I meet you, 
I thought I could help. 

You know what? 
Really helped. 

It helped me realize that all 
my worst fears are real. 

I mean, you can 
talk to the Man himself. 

And that was what he did 
for you. 

So perhaps it is better 
drink at once. 

Could this 
I meant. 

Congratulations, Arlen. 

You can have your 
life back. 

It was not what you wanted? 

Get out! 

-Hi. 
-Hi, Arlen. Or rather, Zebulon. 

It means "exalted". 
Whether ... 

I do not believe I forgot 
the meeting. 

Lucky for you, 
I was there. 

What did it? 

Nothing. 

Children mature, friendship, 
reading, something about robots. 

Mrs. Gold called me 
and said 

Alex wants to recommend 
for the advanced program. 

-This is incredible! 
-Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 

Just when I was 
give you up. 

-And what program is this? 
-Guidance learning. 

-Learning what? 
"How so? 

Ms. Gold seems 
through parent and school ... 

you love so much, 
is a big mistake. 

Keep my child far away 
the kind of person. 

What that child needs 
is self-confidence. 

When I went to thank 
for you attacking me? 

Sorry. Nothing. Glad 
who got what he wanted. 

Are you saying that Alex 
lacks self-confidence? 

It is still a child and 
This pressure will stop it. 

Or turn it 
a vendor. 

When you became 
expert in educating children? 

It's me who holds 
those trappings of death, 

purchase food and tells lies 
which is better than the truth. 

You try to turn it 
in whatever it is, 

instead of looking 
who he really is. 

-And that ... 
Who are you to judge? 

Alex is everything to me 
and give the best for him. 

In doing so, it is good to 
that his father will not return. 

What did he? 

-What did he? 
Nothing. 

He asked 
how long it lasts 2weeks. 

Said nothing. 

He knows the truth, 
but need to hear from you. 

Let me guess. 
God said this to you. 

"They are having a hard time 
difficult, go there and help them. " 

No, of course not. 
Not want to help anyone. 

Not want to meet anyone. 
Want to stay here and watch. 

While others try 
find a way. It should be hilarious. 

Not it. 

I feel more alone now 
than before I met you. 

CLOSING THE DEAL 

Excuse me. 

You must be Kris. 

Terry Fraser 
agent Arlen. 

How did you get? 

Wait. I do not care. 
I do not care. 

What's going on? 

Do not you know? 

Arlen come here to talk about 
20a anniversary of the book. 

It's a miracle! 

He called me and told à night 
bring the books here. 

He said he had warned 
all websites. All! 

Come here! 

What's going on? 

The so-Terry came here 
with those boxes of books 

and said that his friend Arlen 
comes to speak here today. 

Let's get busy! 

We have no money 
to pay for it. 

Kris, was a gift. 

-Where is he? 
-You are welcome. 

No, Kris. 
Help me with this! 

Hello, everybody. 

<i> will accommodate you 
in a minute. 

Ready. 
Just fill it. 

We meet all 
I promise. 

What are you doing now? 

I'm kinda busy. 

Arlen will talk 
the bookstore. 

What <i> Arlen? 

Arlen Faber. 

There he is! 

Ladies and gentlemen, this is 
a very special occasion. 

Something so we 
20years ago. 

The author of "Me and God". 

He showed us 
a glimpse of paradise. 

Arlen Faber. 

Thank you, Terry. Was right 
I should have done this before 

Thanks for coming. 

I would also like to thank 
Kris Lucas and the Distributor "Books Exchange" 

by allowing 
I use the shop. 

Is the best book store 
Philadelphia. 

Of the people who liked 
my book 

one person realized that he 
could help people. A. 

Terry Fraser. 

Terry was the only person 
which saw its value. 

I came here to say something to you. 
Hold the applause until the end. 

I know many of you 
Have you any questions. 

I can not talk to God. 

Here's the deal. 

For 20years, discovered 
my father had a disease. 

All he had 
and everything we did together, 

would be taken from him. 
One memory at a time. 

I received the news and I begged 
for help I do not know who. 

And nothing. 

I had questions, I 
responses. Needed them! 

You know how it is. 

Guess what happened. 

I could not get anything. 

And that irritated me 
pra caramba. 

So ... 

one day I got 
to write these questions. 

And answers to them came 
in my mind and well written. 

When I found myself, 
had a lot of pages. 

One thing led to another e. .. 

It was so 
"Me and God" was created. 

That's it. 

At that time, 
not given much importance. 

I would like it to be true 
more incredible than that. 

Mean 
was all made up? 

I do not know. 

Maybe. 

Maybe someone up there 
used my anger and pain 

to become part 
of some divine plan. 

And if there is some divine plan, 
'm certainly not included. 

I'm not the guy 
with answers. 

I'm just a guy ... 

Brought back 
civilization with all its might. 

Wait. 
And all those questions? 

Best advice I could give 
and I meant every word. 

Sorry. 
To go now. 

Then, 
is equal to all of us. 

Not yet 
but I'm trying. 

To follow me! 

Can you wait a bit? 
This is ridiculous. 

You're right. It's ridiculous. 

You are complicated 
and confused. 

Alex and I do not need 
it. 

Need-yes. 
No! 

-You can go ... 
-And it was all a lie. 

-And I do not ... 
-Shut up, Elizabeth! 

All I said was true. 
It came from an invisible being. 

Came to me! 

Me. 

Shall I say it's 
fine for lying? 

I fall into your arms 
and say that is forgiven? 

I understand you. 

He was protecting himself, 
but lost control. 

Happens 
the best families. 

Let's leave it alone. 

It is not enough for me. 

Yes, I lied. Yes, sorry. 
Yes, I cheated. Yes to all. 

But you know, the answer 
all my questions ... 

It is a child like Alex, 
has a mother as you. 

If we could start ... 

maybe it ends 
a better way. 

Maybe. 

Elizabeth. 

Arlen.
