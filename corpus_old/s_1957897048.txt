We should get a couple of shots and you
can get in like the side or something.

Marcos De Niza?

Who do you think made it?

No, no, no, no, no!

Oh, fuck!

No!

<i>This is 58.</i>

<i>I'm gonna need an ambulance.</i>

<i>I have a multiple 10-53.</i>

<i>Suspect is heading west,</i>

<i>he is a Hispanic male.</i>

<i>47-54.
Until we get the guy in custody,</i>

<i>keep it going Code 3
until we get an update.</i>

<i>All my years
given to this, to them.</i>

<i>You know my heart, my family,</i>

<i>generations of proud trackers.</i>

Thank you for coming in
on such short notice, Mister...

Monteenz?

Montenez.

Is that Mexican?

Are you Mexican?

No. Pascua Yaqui and Meskwaki.

I don't fuck around.

Excuse me? Why isn't that on?

That goes on
once we're straight.

About?

This could be big or small, Ed.

A person like me doesn't show up

unless
Washington thinks shit's bad.

And in your neck of the woods.

Or neck of the desert.

Well, between you and me, this half-breed
indigenous character you've concocted,

doesn't work.

You've been dirty
since the Shadow Wolves, Ed.

Keep that name
out of your mouth.

There it is.

That hot streak they spoke of.

This is case number 1-0-3-3-6-9.

The questioning of Ed Montenez.

Thank you, Agent Montenez,
for coming in and good morning.

Now, it says here that
you spoke with Agent Christy

and you heard gunfire
the day of August 21st?

Diablito.

You left me, ese.

No?

Hey, real talk, homie.
We gotta get the fuck out of here, man.

You left me, ese!

You fucking left me.

Get that fucking
<i>cuete</i> out of my face, dog.

It's not what you think, eh.

You left me, ese!

You fucking...
It's not what you fucking think!

You did steal from there!

You left me!

Fuck!

Gordo's fucking up, ese.

Gordo's a dead fucking bitch.

I wanna tell you something

but don't trip, ese.

What do you mean, don't trip?

Huh. I had this
dream the other night.

Actually,
I've had it a couple of times.

You and me

running from the Negra.

We go in to hide,

I turn around

and boom, I get shot, ese.

The trippy shit is,

instead of helping me,

you strangle me, ese.

Man.

Maybe you were
just trying to help me

so I could
fucking beat Chief Alvarez

for putting me back in <i>la pinta.</i>

Or maybe you were sending
me to <i>mi madre en el cielo.</i>

It could be the message, bro.

You're a trip.

He's not answering his radio.

Maybe he turned it off.

You up for a run?

No, dude,
we gotta lay low for a while.

Why do you guys need to lay low?

Fuck the crooked law.

Well, I sure am glad we
have your blessing, honey.

Thank you.

Look, we're fine.

Even if there
was a remote chance.

I mean,
it's like a fucking war zone

out there right now, man.

For all they know,
it's cartel shit.

Alright.

Let's do this.

<i>Battery suspect
is at 318 East 3rd Street.</i>

<i>Is that related to your call or
do you want a different patrol unit?</i>

You hear that?

10-46.

He ain't helping nobody.

I'm telling you, that crooked Indian's
working with the cartel.

Let's head over
to the south peak.

Roger that.

This is high-powered.

Maybe the cartel
shot their falcon.

Yeah, well we better move on.

Unless you want to call it in.

No, thanks.

This is that devil
idiot from the truck.

And those are
your bullets in him.

Let's get out of here.

Coyote!

Hey, Willy.
Ed.

It's gonna be coming
in next couple of days.

Be like a moving truck.

It gets really
hot in them trucks.

Sure does.

It's gonna be
in a green backpack.

Laters.

Later, Willy.

Shut the fuck up!

Fuck!

Calm down, ese!

Calm down?

<i>La pinta</i> made you soft
ever since you came out.

And that hair.

When're you gonna cut that shit?

You look like a.

Man, shit the fuck up, man.

Just pay attention
to what you're doing, ese.

We're almost there.

<i>This is my time.</i>

I think we need to start covering
this stretch, right there.

That's where they're
bringing the trucks through.

Yeah, that would explain the tracks.
Yeah, well just last week

they found a broken down
moving truck over by Lo Keyo.

Well, hell. I sure am glad you decided to
stick around, Max. I really appreciate it.

I believe in the good fight,
you know that.

Yes, you do.

Babe, Ed's here.

Shit, you didn't
let him in, did you?

No, he's out front. Said he'd seen some
coyotes over by the livestock.

Yeah right.

Alright, stay right here,
I'll go take care of this.

Hey there, Ed.

This is a mighty
old man you got here.

Yeah, that's a big one.

All those years
to make it that big.

Yeah, long time.

I just wanted to
come by and say thank you

for honoring our agreement.

Yeah, so there isn't
even any coyotes on my land

right now, is there?

I didn't know if Lily knew.

Sure enough.

Always working the angles, huh?

Not much to agree to.

You ran most of
my people off, Ed.

The law did.

An officer was shot, Travis.

Did you forget?

It was an accident.

Kinda easy to forget, you know?

You can't run the law
in your own hands anymore.

So it's the law
that's talking to me now, is that it?

They're watching you, Travis.

Once more and you go to prison.

Away for a long time.

I saw some coyotes by your
heffers about a half mile up.

So what is it then?
Are you here to tell me about some coyotes?

Are you feeling a little guilty

or are you just
here to sniff around

like some sort
of fucking law dog?

We used to be friends back then,
before this border shit.

Yeah, that was a long time ago.

Way back in high school.

Now you're just an acquaintance.

I'm sorry you feel that way.

You know, you and your people
have been walking across the border

back and forth from here to
Mexico for a real long time.

Yes, for thousands of years,
all the way to the ocean.

Well it's a shame all that's
about to come to an end

once they put that wall up.

Huh?

Be careful, Travis.

Oh, I will.

And until they put that wall up,

you know I'll be here
defending my land.

That's my right.

And you know it.

Were you going to shoot Ed?

So how long have you
been working the border?

23 years, agent.

They let you keep
the hair and the braids?

Years ago they did a study
on native trackers.

Yeah, I've heard this one.

They took a bunch
of Native Americans

and they cut off all
their hair and all of a sudden

they were confused
and couldn't find shit.

But the fellow with the
hair always found his shit.

It's beautiful here.

It beats shoveling shit.

You know, I wake up in
the mornings these days,

no more pain.

So how's your husband?

Larry.

Yeah, he's my boyfriend.

He's fine.

It's been a little tough.

Yeah. Hopefully this
will make things better.

Hopefully.

Package will be
there in two days.

But you might need a little
assistance getting it over.

Things are a lot
more difficult right now.

I can arrange for something.

I have planned for this.

Thank you, Sid.

No sweat, kid.

If it wasn't for you,

I'd be a retired
addict right about now.

I see the tracks
coming in, but where the fuck do they go?

They're probably using
carpet on their fucking feet.

But I see two
of them right there.

Run, motherfucker!

Money!

Shut up! Get down!

I have money! Money! Money!

Stay down!

I don't want your
fucking money, shut up!

No shoot!

No shoot!

My... my heart!

My heart!

My heart!

Yeah?

Well, I've got
something for your heart.

You fake fuck!

Get on your knees.

Can you believe this fucking
kraut tried to pay us off?

Why the hell would a German want
to sneak across here anyway?

It's been awhile
since we caught a Euro.

Yeah. Why don't you ask the
Mexican where the others went

and why the hell he's
hanging out with this guy?

Hey!

My friend.

He wants water too.

Did you hear that?

I heard that.

He understands
exactly what we're saying.

Why the fuck are you so guilty?!

Hey, hey, hey, it's cool.

They're just thirsty.

We're just two honest guys
going to America to work, ese.

Ese.

Two honest guys
trying to work, my ass!

You're a fucking coyote!

Try to tell me you're not, motherfucker!

You're the coyote and
this bastard is the one

that's paying you off!

What the hell's
wrong with this guy?

Jesus Christ, he's having
a heart attack or some shit.

Should I cut him loose?

Hell no.

No!

He's fucking dead, Travis!

I never knew I was that scary.

Now this is the
second day in a row

we've been stuck on
some stupid shit out here.

It's probably not even on today.

And what the fuck
does it matter anyway?

That guy might live.

Give me the phone
and I'll make the call!

Hey!

Cut me loose. We have ten grand
right there, ese.

I'll go home and go to bed.

Perfect fucking English.

Hey.

You guys are those motherfuckers

that killed that
border agent, aren't you?

No, that wasn't us. Why don't
you shut your trap, boy?

Travis!

I can't handle any more
of this bullshit out here!

Yeah, well we can't
afford to call this in either,

otherwise that's the end
of protecting all this shit!

We might as well cut
him loose and call it a day

so we can all go back to bed!

That other one's
probably a cho-mo anyway.

You know,

I know where you come from, man.

They say you can
take either the silver

or the bullet.

I might be a lot of things,

but I sure as hell
ain't no coyote's bitch.

Just another stupid
American wasting money.

Cut me loose!

Stand up.

I said stand up!

Get the fuck up!

Travis! Cut him loose!

Travis!

Just cut him loose!

Run, motherfucker!

Very unnecessary.

All of this shit!

Very unnecessary!

Take a look at this, Ed.

Do you know these guys?

Local border watchers.

Militia men.

Not dirty.

I didn't ask if
they were dirty, Ed.

The guy on the left,

he's my friend, Travis Hunter.

He's a good man,
but a little mixed-up.

Mixed-up how?

Takes everything to heart.

Prefers to react.

He seems like he's
always around when shit happens.

What's that got to do with me?

Well, Washington got
wind of a vigilante militia,

killing illegals.

Maybe the same ones who shot
that border agent last summer.

There's a lot
of groups out here.

And then there's this.

Hans Ferguson.

German software
tycoon found dead.

Wanted by Interpol.

What did he do?

Pedophile.

Peddling child porn
across the EU.

I reported this body.

I'm aware of it.

Yeah, I bet you are aware of it.

But you're real intimate
with the details as well, huh?

Covering for your buddy?

What the fuck?!

We almost had one!

He had a pack of
shit on his back, Ed!

I can't have you
running down people, Travis!

Don't make me
fucking lock you up!

What did you say to me?

Travis! No!

You ain't locking me up
for hunting these animals down!

They're the ones
that are breaking the law!

I ain't turning around, Travis!

This ain't your first
speaking now, Travis!

Don't make me turn around!

You boys come up
on any moving trucks?

Nope. We've been on
that coyote since daybreak.

I thought you would say that.

He knows we were there.

He don't know shit.

He can keep
stumbling around in the dark

for all I give a fuck.

He's got you paranoid.

I ain't scared of him,
but I do respect him.

He can smell bullshit.

You know what I was thinking?

Back there
I could've sworn I heard a baby.

Crying.
Yeah.

Yeah, me too.
Like there was a few of them

hiding back there in
the bushes when we ran by.

That guy did look familiar.

I don't know about him, but that
pack he had on his backside

sure looked like
the one from the truck.

Wanna head back, flank him?

Yep.

I can tell
you don't like me, Ed.

I'm sure you get that a lot.

Yes, I do in my line of work.

Being gender deficient
in a man's game.

But you know what?

What?

I don't give a fuck.

Alright,
now back to the real what.

I think I have an idea
as to why you quit

such a prestigious outfit
like the Shadow Wolves.

It's because you were broke.
Really?

Two divorces.

Headed for a third.

Gotta make it happen this time.

Yeah.

The action wasn't
happening down on the res,

so you had to go find it.

I left the res because
it wasn't what I grew up with.

It changed.

Or maybe you changed, Ed.

When you set out to hunt a man

you better be prepared, agent.

Excuse me?

Hunting a being is
about connecting to the root.

Damn it.

He's blinding me over here.

I told you to go home, Travis.

What the fuck
are you doing, Travis?

You're gonna shoot Ed?

Just glancing him.

What the fuck are we doing?

Well, the fact is,

we fucked up,

so we can either
go down for that shit

or we can try to
remedy the situation.

That all starts
with following these two.

You know, Travis,
I believe in this,

but that, this,
this fucking scheming?

Fuck!

All my time in the service,
I never did shit.

I never killed a civilian.

Not up until now.

This is Pepper Charles
reporting on the border

at Hunter Ranch
with Travis Hunter.

Mr. Hunter,
it has been said by you

that illegal immigrants
are entering our country

to vote Democratic.

Do you have any
evidence to back this up?

Well I find it ironic that
you refer to them as immigrants

while they're actually
criminals that cross over here

by the millions and
cast votes for liberals.

And do you have any facts
to support that claim?

Well, I know what
you're trying to do

and the only thing
you're actually accomplishing

is showing the Americans
that you can make a mockery

of a true patriot.

It's kind of shameful.

If what you're saying were true,

how does a non-citizen get past
identification verifications

and other measures
to prevent voter fraud?

And why would they
put themselves in unnecessary jeopardy

just to vote?

You see, this is a fine
example of how the media

likes to deflect the
real issues with fake news.

So you're
standing by your claim?

Yes, and I think it
takes pretty brave folks

to come out here
and speak up to deliver

the chilling message of
truth to the American people.

Yes, if what you
were saying were true,

it would indeed be chilling.

Thank you.
Defend the line!

Well, there you have it, Duke.
Back to you.

Defend the line!
Defend the line!

Defend the line!
Defend the line!

That was bullshit, man.

I'm so proud of you, honey.

They have us
surrounded, little one.

If we stick around,
we'll surely get caught.

Way to be
inconspicuous there, Ed.

It's a trap.

He knows that
we've been following him.

Bullshit.

You think he's
the only one that can track?

We've been running parallel
against the wind all day

and keeping a good distance.

He's a Shadow Wolf.

Shadow Wolf, my ass.

I grew up with
all those res kids

and they ain't
any better than us.

And I know that
dirty little Mexican's

up on that hill somewhere.

I say we keep glancing
the area and wait for him

to light something up.

Then go get him.

Bring him back down to Ed?

Yep.

Like we're
being nice and helpful.

Then plug them both.

We're almost to
the Interstate 8,

and from there you can
go deep into this country.

And in this country,

you can be
anything your heart desires.

Maybe even.

Huh?

Travis! Travis!

What?
He's on the move.

Let's go! Let's go!

Shit.

Why'd he be burning his shit?

It's a baby's diaper.

What the fuck,
are they running babies now?

Was there a baby at that truck?

I don't know.

Travis!

I don't know, it all
happened too fucking fast!

You were down in that shit.

I could've swore
I heard a baby crying!

Shut your fucking mouth.

Don't you say that,
I don't kill babies.

I am sick and tired of
you telling me what to do and what to say!

It's because of you we
are knee deep in this shit!

Yeah, well
I seem to recall you doing

a whole lot of
shooting too, brother.

This shit isn't gonna work, ese.

Fuck the <i>mojados.</i>
Hey, look,.

It's too fucking risky, ese.
Besides, we already crossed over the border

and I don't have time
to argue with bitchy <i>mojados.</i>

Grab the baby
in the back, <i>muchacho.</i>

Sid.

There's been a change of plans.

Listen to me,
you little schmuck.

Sid, just listen to me.

The next time you call me
it better be confirmed

that my package
made it to the Indian.

I got it all under control.

You'll get the
rest of your money then.

Lasaro!

Hey! Hey!

A lot has changed since
you were in <i>la pinta,</i> ese.

Do you hear that?

Yeah.

Let's rock.

Freeze!
Everybody get your hands up!

Get your dirty hands up, amigo!

Oh yeah, you're the ringleader.

No,
you "habla inglÃ©s" just fine!

No!

What the fuck is he saying?

I should've frisked them.

We'll find
something soon, princess.

Never catch me.
Hold on, princess! Hold on!

Give me the pack!

I don't see it
in your fucking eyes. Later.

Give me your hand!

Looks like they disappeared.

I know they came in here.

Maybe they doubled back
or the coyote did.

Or else he got in the river
and headed downstream.

You think the
coyote jumped in the river

and Ed's chasing beside him?

Or better yet,

Ed's a mile down at the bend,
cutting him off at that pass.

This isn't good, man.

Yeah, it's gonna
start to get messy.

Well, let's get through the bend. We
don't even have time to think.

Come on!
We're not gonna catch up, man.

The current's too fast.

They're probably miles up.

Bullshit!

You ain't quitting now, man!

Don't question my heart, okay?

Get out of my face!

You don't want
a piece of this, Travis.

I'm all you got, man!

We're all we got.

Bullshit!

Once Lily finds out
what we did...

Fuck! End of the war, huh?

You just give up
and go to prison?

I'd rather be dead
than locked up.

Then why are we fighting?

Because you're a
self-absorbed asshole, man!

Stop referring to
all this shit as war!

This ain't war!

Hey, look, don't think
you're better than me

just because you
served and I didn't.

I've never held
that against you, man.

But you gotta stop with
all this gung-ho bullshit!

Yeah. I guess I get a little
carried away at times.

You love your country.

I love my country too.

I know a place right here,

you can get all the food
and milk you want.

Yeah, right there.

Right there.

Where were you
in the winter of 1998?

That was almost 20 years ago.

Oh, come on, Ed. You remember
that place like it was yesterday.

How could you forget that?

The guy that was stabbed
in the neck right next to you

while you were on
the phone with your wife?

That was a lifetime ago.

I'm a different person.

Maybe.

I know that face can
scare a person straight.

It would me.

You're a convicted felon, Ed.

That was expunged.

My rights have been restored.

I can vote,

have a gun.

Is this why I'm here?

This can go two ways, Ed.

I can get up
and walk out of here,

go back to Washington

and you and I have never met.

Or I can press record
and erase your ass.

What do I have to do
for you to go back?

There's a package coming in.

On the border?

Yep.

Through your corridor.

On a moving truck
in the desert in two days.

And all you have to do
is make an unofficial bust.

Hey, princess.

Hey!

Motherfucker!

Stop!

I'm tired of you people
messing with my house.

Stay away from that bag.

I said stop.

Yeah, man.

I was thirsty.

This is America, right?

Don't play stupid with me.

You know
exactly where you're at.

You didn't even try
the faucet's out back, why?

Well, I was...
Why, because you knew they were off.

You knew because you've been here before!
No, no, please, please.

Alright?

What the hell are
you doing with that baby?

If I told you, man,
you'd never believe me.

Just try me.

Here you go, man.

She's all cleaned up.

There she is.

Why you helping me, man?

My wife.

She was a kind soul.

No matter what kind of people
came through here,

she'd accept them,
she'd help them.

A lot more tolerant than I was.

So, I'm doing it for her

and I'm doing it for
the future of that child.

Why are you doing it?

I mean, a guy like you, you could've left
that kid out there to die easily.

My mother.

She always used to say,

"You either create or take."

And all my life I've taken.

The only thing I ever created
was pain for others.

A baby changes all that?

Si, man.

Thanks for your help, man.

I appreciate it.

Yeah, well,

don't thank me yet.

We haven't made it
to the interstate.

First we gotta get
through the corridor.

Let me show you.

I got a map.

As I'm sure you're aware of
this patch right here.

It's got lookouts on both sides.

Exactly. Everything
funnels in through there.

What if I was able to make my way up over
one of the hills through the Falcon?

Right through?

That would give you
the element of surprise.

Mm-hmm.

Best thing I can do for you is

tie up that border agent
that's tracking you,

give you a head start.

Where's he at?

In the bushes right over there.

We can elude him, man.

It's not a problem.

Yeah.

<i>Have I gone too far?</i>

<i>Stalking him like some animal</i>

<i>and to deal with the Devil.</i>

Hey, I'm ready, man.

Alright.

<i>For all that has been done</i>

<i>to him out here,</i>

<i>he still chooses to be kind.</i>

<i>Bless his heart.</i>

We're clear.

Who the fuck is this guy?
I don't know, but whoever it is, he's coming in hot.

Hold on!

Travis!

It's gonna be all right.

Ed!

Wherever the fuck you are,

Travis is dying, man!

Sleep well, soldier.

The great Shadow Wolf.

Coyote!

This is it.

When you get famous

don't forget Lasaro
Antonio Laveras Gutierrez.

<i>You have
no choice but the corridor,</i>

<i>Coyote.</i>

I'm gonna go take
care of these fools.

Fuck!

I've failed you.

You can't outrun a bullet, ese?

Don't worry.

I'll kill you both.

You're home now, princess.

What happened to you?
Work.

What're you
gonna do about the baby?

I'm gonna raise it.

Move on.

Can't have kids.

Sorry to hear that, agent.

Diane.

Diane.

I have this friend and he
set it up as far as the border.

And that's when I came in.

Well, if I could
dig up your past,

anybody could.

Why don't you go retire?

Go get that fat pension.

Thank you, Ed,
for giving me a family.

Don't thank me.

Thank the coyote.

We're going home, princess.
