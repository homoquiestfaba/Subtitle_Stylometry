<i>But really, he's like my brother;</i>

<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>
<i>I'm a boxing promoter;</i>

<i>I was a happy boxing promoter</i>
<i>until a week ago, and then;</i>

<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>

<i>Don't they come from Antwerp?</i>

<i>- Himy, would you listen to this?</i>
<i>- Do we have a choice?</i>

<i>It wasn't meant to be taken literally;</i>

<i>It's a nice story, Adam and Eve;</i>

<i>It's bound with moral fibre; ; ;</i>

<i>; ; ; but asking a grown man</i>
<i>to believe it?</i>

<i>What is it?</i>

<i>Well, what is it?</i>

<i>What you want I should do,</i>
<i>drop my pants?</i>

<i>Okay, go through;</i>

<i>It's a nice story;</i>

<i>It's just that; Just a story;</i>

<i>Catholic religion is based</i>
<i>on a mistranslation;</i>

<i>Enough already; Ruben, say something;</i>

<i>Listen; Are you busy?</i>
<i>I'll tell you the whole story;</i>

<i>The Septuagint scholars mistranslated</i>
<i>the Hebrew word for "young woman"; ; ;</i>

<i>; ; ; into the Greek word for "virgin;"</i>

<i>It was an easy mistake to make; ; ;</i>

<i>; ; ; because there was only a subtle</i>
<i>difference in the spelling;</i>

<i>So, they came up with a prophecy;</i>

<i>"Behold, the virgin shall conceive</i>
<i>and bear us a son; "</i>

<i>You understand? It was "virgin"</i>
<i>that caught people's attention;</i>

<i>It's not everyday a virgin conceives</i>
<i>and bears a son;</i>

<i>But leave that for a couple</i>
<i>of hundred years to stew; ; ;</i>
