For years,
the Wildman of the Navidad.

was the talk and mystery of Texas.

One after the other,
rumors surfaced of a creature.

...prowling the dense thicket along the.

...lower regions
of the Navidad River.

...just west of the tiny
rural community of Sublime.

Sometimes the unknown was called.

"The Wild Woman," as again and again...

...two and even three of the
elusive beings ran together...

...leaving a trail of curiosities
and terror in their wake.

Over time, history books
outlined numerous theories.

...on their possible origin...

...but for the residents of Sublime...

...none of them conclusively explained.

...how the sightings continued
far beyond record.

Official reports remained
sketchy until the recent discovery.

...of a detailed journal
kept by townsman Dale S. Rogers.

Within the pages of his
veracious account.

were the gritty details
and graphic illustrations.

...of a bizarre series of encounters
with the savage.

What follows is his story...

wretched, but entirely true.

Get on over here, boy.

You're gonna watch this.

That blood make you
a little queasy, boy?

I shoulda made you gut
and skin your first one.

...like my old man did me.

It's all part of the ritual.

You sure didn't waste
any time, did you, Charlie?

Nope.
Yeah.

Boy, that's sure gonna be
some good eating.

Yes, sir.

That's a nice one.

He got his first deer.

Good backstrap.

First blood, huh, boy?

She's dead and I'm thirsty.

You kill the deer,
we drink the beer.

You said
a mouthful there.

Tanya, bring me
a couple of Stars.

Well, we got us
a good eating one.

Peckerhead son of a bitch.

Damn, what's it been -
three hours of the season?

Actually, the boy here
did the shooting.

Made a shit shot.

I finished her off
with my knife.

He didn't have the balls for it.

Figures.

So... Little scared.

...of that deer were you?

Karl Crabtree, look what
the cat dragged in.

Ain't bad shit,
is it, boss?

No, sure enough ain't.

Say, how come you still got.

...that froot loop Dale
working for you?

He's a strange
son of a bitch.

I mean, never says
nothing to nobody.

Well, how'd you be if your
old man was shot down cold.

...in the street like that?

He ain't never been right since.

All he does is tinker
around with that bullshit crap.

...in his yard all day -

...not to mention that
retard wife of his.

...stuck in her roller chair.

Jesus Christ.

Hey, you know, before that bitch
had that car wreck.

...and got stroked out,
that was some Grade-A pussy.

Really?

You're a cat's ass.

But Jack, you oughta think
about really getting yourself.

...a good welder, you know?

God damn, I'd have to go
all the way to Campbelton...

45 miles, to find one.

There ain't nobody in this
town's dependable.

What the fuck am I, Jack?

Am I chopped liver?

I mean, plus...

I come with my perks.

Yeah, you do.

Rogers!

You're fired!

I'm giving Karl your job!

What the fuck
did you do that for?

Now he's gonna think
I'm the one that got him fired.

Well, you did, Karl.

Quit being such
a goddamn candy ass!

God, I swear, Earl, if you don't
start burning something cleaner...

...every damn law dog
around here is gonna find.

...that there still of yours.

Ah, that machine smokes worse
than a cancer patient.

It's that 199 proof diesel
you're serving up, Earl.

Those people don't know their ass
from a hole in the ground, man.

They're gonna think I'm burning
trash out there.

Shit, burning New York City
is more like it.

A goddamn blind man
could see that smokestack.

...from Ching Chong China.

Them law dogs know better.

...than to come around
these parts, right, Earl?

You're correct.

They come out here,
they'll go away limping.

# I can feel the presence
in the room here beside me #

# I turn but there's
nobody there #

# I turn but
there's nobody there #

And that was
the Manchaca Allstars.

with "Gardenia Blossoms".

You're listening to 99AM-CC...

...non-stop Country and Western.

...favorites for the lower
Navidad regions.

Today marks the official start
of deer season in Lavaca County.

Residents are gearing up for the.

...estimated 3- To 400 hunters.

...making their way through the
area in the next few weeks.

I'll tell you what...

...that number would be a lot
higher if old Samuel Rogers' boy.

Dale opened up that five generations
of Rogers land he's a-sittin' on.

That's a 600-acre gold
mine he's got out there.

# Well, if you're
feeling down and out #

# Tell him
what you want #

# If you're feeling
down and out #

# Tell him what you want #

# If you're feeling
down and out #

# Tell him what you want #

# Call him up
and tell him what you want #

# Jesus is on the main line #

# Tell him what you want #

# Tell him what you want #

Beau!

Come here, boy!

Come here, boy.

Oh, no.

Looks like I won't be going back.

...to the shop anytime soon.

Jack got himself
another welder.

I shoulda known they play
favorites around here.

But don't you worry, Jean.

Everything's gonna be all right.

I promise you.

I still got those two
gunsmithing jobs.

And I expect a lot more,
being the start of season and all.

Besides, we could always lease out.

...a bit of the land if we had to.

Ralph, Ralph!

Ralph!

Shut the door, quick!

I never seen anything
so awful in my life.

What are you talking about?

Something took after me
down in the swamp.

What was it?

I don't know whether
it was a man, a beast.

...or old satan himself.

Have you been drinking?

Not a drop, so help me.

Been a lot of shit
talking around here lately...

...hasn't there?

Mm-hmm.

Speaking of shit...

...motherfucker is uglier
than homemade sin.

...and his tits
smell like wolf pussy.

Think he's ever seen
a pocket knife before?

Give it to him.

It's all yours, dude.

No, it's all yours, dude!

You pig fucker!

Couple of smart boys, huh?

That son of a bitch...

...always backed into the corner...

...scribbling on some silly note pad.

You'd think he was writing.

...love notes to that Mexican
living with him.

Well, I don't know about that...

...but he opened up that
river bottom this year.

You lying son of a bitch.

Seen the sign
on my way over here.

Well, I'll be damned.

That bottom hasn't been hunted
in 30-some years.

I bet there are some
monster bucks down there.

Yeah, and you know every
limp dick between here.

...and Atascosa County's gonna
want a piece of that.

Yeah, probably pay
top dollar too.

Can I get you anything, hon?

I guess let me have
another one of those, Tanya.

All right.

Hey, Tanya.
Yes?

If you don't mind, would you,
uh, hang these up for me?

Sure.

Uh, this round's on me, Tanya.
Get me another Star.

What you drawing on there, Dale?

Karl.

Look, I just dropped by to
say that I'm sorry about.

...taking your job and all.

You know, Jack can be
kind of a peckerwood.

You know what I mean?

Yeah, well, you and him
are pretty tight.

Yeah, but look, I came by
to offer you a proposition.

I know how you like that shine.

I been brewing and I was.

...thinking maybe we could
do a little trade.

I go hunting on your land and...

...uh, well, bring by maybe 10, 11,
12 jugs maybe for you?

Compensate and all.

Might be able to work
something out.

All right then.

Why don't you come by
this evening?

What time?

6:00 or so.

That'd be great.

You got that?

Well, Dale, I brang
a couple extra.

...for a little bit of
good measure, you know?

Uh, so, I got my, uh...

...gun in the car... Sir.

Uh, yeah, so it's down there.

...at the bottoms, right?

Yeah, just, um just
drive your truck down the road.

...there and, uh, take a,
take a right on, on the second gate.

O.K.

Don't, don't go on the first
one, now, I got some.

...cows down on the river bottom.

...and, um... Second gate.

All right.

You, you don't mind if i If
I take one for the hunt, do ya?

I'll bring you another
one later... Right?

Yeah. Appreciate it, Karl.

Thank you, Dale.

Ma'am, Sir.

Jesus.

Dale, how much you charging.

...for them hunts
out there now anyway?

Evidently too much.

Tanya, have you seen Karl?

Been here since
seven this morning.

Hey, Dale.

Karl.

Hey, Karl...

Did you shoot anything
out there yesterday?

Yeah, I shot... I shot.

...me a big old doe...
Something.

Karl, what did you
shoot out there?

Do you have any
bears out there?

No, there ain't
no bears, Karl.

I have a couple of flyers
left over, Dale.

I didn't have anywhere else
to hang 'em.

Thank you, Tanya.

Well, well, well...

I'll be damned.

Look what I got.

I've been waiting for this day
a long time.

Melvin.

Your daddy always
talked about.

...leasing that property
again someday.

Well, I already been
out there.

Shot me a Mossback...

...big old fucker.

I already got it.

Shut up, Karl.

You probably
put one up its ass.

Miss Annie Oakley over here.

Blow it out your ass.

Chicken shit son of a bitch.

Besides, a man takes
another man's job.

...ain't worth a puddle of piss.

Anyway I got a little
incentive here.

Take this.

I got the winning ticket.

Oh...

Mmm...

Huh?

Mmm...

Oh...

Mmm...

Mmm, oh, oh...

Come on, boy.

Melvin.

My son Kevin.

Nice to meet you.

If you, uh, you go down this
road right here and veer off...

...just take your second right...

...you'll come to a gate
and that oughta.

...take you down to the river bottom.

Uh, you want us to set up on
the other side then?

Well, actually, if, uh,
if you don't mind...

I'd rather you set up, set up camp
over to the west.

It's just a better piece of
land... it's a little greener.

...over there and I just, uh,
I just think it'd be better.

All right, Dale, we'll see
you in a couple of days.

Come on, boy.

I haven't been down
here in a coon's age.

Me and Dale's old man used to.

...plant oats up and down this
bottom stretch...

God rest his soul.

I doubt that there's
a lonelier place around here.

...than this bottom.

That man's kinda weird -

...that Dale guy.

Yeah, he's a lot different.

...than his daddy.

Didn't he say to set up camp
further downstream?

Hell, if we'd set up further.

...downstream, it'd be darker than.

...a well digger's ass before we
get any hunting in.

You brought the 30-30, daddy?

Special occasion.

There's big game all over this
stretch of bottom, boy.

I can't believe it took him
this long to open it up.

Karl said he shot a bear
the other day.

Karl's a damn drunk.

It's trash talk like that.

...that gets the people believing in
shit like Sasquatch.

It's just lies.

...or hallucinations brought on
by the town's killer.

The town's killer?

Moonshine, boy.

Son of a bitch!

Goddamn shit!

Chicken shit son of a bitch.

What are you trying to do?

Send smoke signals
to the next village?

I've been working on this
machine all day.

I can't get the alcohol
contents right.

Shit fire!

That'd take the calluses
off a nigger's hands!

I told you, the alcohol
content's too high.

Half of the people in town
are nitwits now.

You take that in there
they're all gonna be brain-dead.

You know, uh,
Samuel's boy Dale.

...opened his land up
this week.

Yeah.

He probably needs the money.

You think it's still
out there?

Lt?

We don't even know
if there is an it.

You know what it is, Earl.

Don't play dumb on me.

That thing could up and kill
someone one of these days.

...as sure as the world.

Don't be causing
any problems, Lyle.

You know you enjoy that.

...dirty money that lines
your pocket every month.

What happens when it
comes out, Earl?

'Cause it's coming.

I guarantee you that.

It's coming.

That's a good'un, boy.

Man, look at the tusks!

Don't you think you need
to take another shot, boy?

What the hell was that?

Aw, nothing... Just some bucks.

...out there rooting around
for some does.

Grab that hog and let's go.

Hold up there, boy.

Hold this.

I want to show you something.

Stick your finger in that, boy.

It's wet, daddy.

That's what they call
pear pussy.

Pear pussy, boy.

You know, I think we oughta go.

...a little deeper in the
bottoms tomorrow.

That's where the big'uns are.

Daddy, you sure that was
a buck back there?

Yeah, it was a buck.

What do you think it was?

A big old bear?

Speaking of, I gotta go take me.

...a big old grizzly shit.

Daddy?

Dad?

All right, dad, I'm not 10.

I'm not gonna fall for this.

Dad?

God damn, daddy!
You scared the shit out of me!

Relax, boy, I'm just fooling.

Boy, I ain't never heard you
cuss like that.

Relax.

Good night, boy.

Night, daddy.

# I don't hear
the hound dogs anymore #

# Or see them
sneakin' round the door #

# Way they did way back in '54 #

# Lord, I don't hear
the hound dogs anymore #

# I don't hear
the hound dogs anymore #

# Or see them
sneakin' round the door #

# Way they did way back in '54 #

# Lord, I don't hear
the hound dogs anymore #

# No, I don't hear
the hound dogs anymore #

I don't want you worrying
about our arguing, Jean.

We just got different views,
that's all.

You know, we've been doing
pretty good with these hunters.

I guess it was sort of a
godsend, me losing that job.

Keeps up like this and I might
be able to get you some therapy.

I know it's been hard.

These last years
have been real hard.

But I think there's some light
at the end of the tunnel...

I really do.

A dense fog advisory has been issued.

...until 10 A.M. Tomorrow morning.

Weather is expected to continue
cool and partly cloudy.

No chance of precipitation
in the immediate forecast.

Tonight's low will be
48 degrees.

Our current temperature is 56...

with the wind out of the
southeast at three miles...

Damn, this sausage is tougher
than a mule's foreskin.

Well, we'd be eating Bigfoot
steaks by now if you'd hurry up.

...and kill that big hairy monster.

...running around out there
at Dale's place.

I got a tube steak for you.

Yeah? Looks more like
a Vienna sausage to me.

Well, when Melvin gets here...

I guarantee you we'll be
eating some deer meat.

He's not back yet?

I hadn't seen him.

I ain't seen him
since Friday.

Hmm.

He's been gone
since Wednesday.

He should be back by now.

Hey, Henry, what'd you
and Mel catch on Sunday?

He never even showed up.

Seemed kind of funny to me.

Didn't show up?

That's like the Pope missing
Sunday meeting.

Yup.

He always goes
catfishing after church.

Think something's wrong?

Aw, Mel's tough as an old boot.

Thank you, Tanya.

My better half
shot anything yet?

Who's that?

Herbert.

No, not that, uh...

Not that I know of.

Keep an eye on him.

You know he shot his big toe off
last year in the Turkey Trot.

Not playing with a full deck.

Dale.

Hey, Lyle.
How you doing?

Doing all right.

You know, old Melvin's been
out there quite some time now...

...hasn't he?

Yeah. I guess he's faring pretty well.

I reckon so.

Now listen, Dale,
I've been thinking.

I know times are tough,
with you out of work...

Jean the way she is and all...

But I sure would hate to see
anything go wrong.

Wrong? What's gonna
go wrong, Lyle?

You know what
I'm talking about.

They're not on
the riverbed, Lyle.

You sure about that?

Yeah.

Well, I'm glad to hear that.

Because if something did
go wrong, I sure would hate.

...to see folks start pointing
fingers at anyone.

Hey, Dale.

You a little bit early for
church, aren't you?

Yeah, I guess I am, preach.

Matter of fact...

I haven't seen you in church
in several Sundays.

Yeah, it's probably...
been quite a while.

Well, you know, Dale...

...it says in the Bible...

...in Proverbs,
chapter 11, verse 3...

If you do the right thing,
honesty will rule your life.

But if you're crooked, you'll be
trapped by your own dishonesty.

Maybe I'll see you in church
Sunday morning.

# Out on
the perilous deep #

# Dangers silently creep #

# And storms
so violently sweeping #

# You're drifting
too far from the shore #

Melvin!

Kevin!

Melvin!

# Freight train, freight train,
running so fast #

# Freight train, freight train, #

# running so fast #

# Please don't tell
what train I'm on... #

Closing down a little
early, are you?

Yeah, well, uh, I might have
been a little, uh, a little rash.

...in my thinking, you know?

Yeah, that's probably the
smartest thing, Dale.

You know, knowing Samuel...

...he'd have wanted it that way.

Stop that, you old pervert!

Who you calling old?

You, that's who.

Ooh, watch it!

You all right, baby?

Aah!

You all right, babe?

Yeah.

What is all of this?

Oh, my God!

Jesus of Nazareth!

And that concludes the sermon.

...here at the
Cornerstone Baptist Church.

So remember, all you have to do.

...is ask Jesus to
come into your heart...

...repent your sins...

...and everlasting life is waiting
for you on the other side.

Now I take you over to 99AM-CC
to listen to a little gospel music.

...from Dark Holler.

Enjoy, and make Jesus
king of your life.

Hurry up, lady, let's get out
of here! Quick!

Oh, mercy me,
what happened to you?

Go! Drive! Get out of here!

There was some crazy animal!

He was cutting my wife up...

Oh, my God!

It was terrible.

That looks terrible.

I'm hurt bad. Hurry!
Get me to town!

I'm getting you to town
as soon as I can.

Drive faster!

I think she's dying, or dead.

All right,
everybody just calm down.

Let's let the man speak.

Vern, can you tell us
what happened?

The son of a bitch
was massive, Sheriff.

He split my wife in two -

...one swipe.

Oh, dear.

Must have stood seven, eight feet.

Ran on two legs,
not all fours.

He was hairy and crazy eyes.

An animal of a man!

See, I told ya!

That wasn't no bear I shot at!

I ain't fucking crazy!

Some sort of wild,
crazy man out there...

...some half-breed.

Look, Melvin and his son
is still down there.

We don't know who else
is in that bottom.

We need to get on down to Dale's
and see about it.

Let's go get that bugger.

Yeah, let's do it!

Let's go!

Now look, going out there tonight.

would only get
someone else hurt.

Now, it'll be long
about dark soon.

First thing in the morning...

we need to meet
at the community center.

with hound dogs, rifles.

...and enough rations
for a two-day hunt.

Now let's get this man
to a medic.

It's O.K.

It's O.K. Now, Jean.

It's O.K., babe.

Holy shit!
What the hell was that?

I don't know, but it was huge!

I'm scared, Otis.

Let's you and me
get out of here.

You don't have to
tell me twice.

It's getting late, baby.

Don't you think you
should come to bed?

I'll be in there as soon
as I finish this off.

You go on in there
and get ready for me.

All right.

Oh.

You're gonna have to be strong, Jean.

You're gonna have
to be real strong.

I know I haven't
been here for you lately...

...but things are gonna change.

I promise you that.

I love you, Jean.

I love you.

Watch yourself
out there, Lyle.

This is something that
shoulda happened a long time ago...

...but I'm gonna make damn
certain it happens today.

Don't you go out of this house
now, you hear?

Put some coffee on the burner.
I should be back directly.

Charlie, let's get
them dogs loaded!

Yeah, go, we gotta hurry!

Who's got some
30-30 ammunition?

I do, I got plenty
in my truck.

Hey, get some goddamn dogs.

You got any shells
for this shotgun?

I ain't got nothing but birdshot left...

...and that ain't good for nothing
but killing rabbits and wetbacks.

Well, that ain't worth shit.

We ain't chasing wetbacks.

All right, we'll load up here
pretty quick.

You got them horses?
How many horses?

I brought you
fellers something to drink.

...in case you get thirsty
down there in the pasture.

Thank you.
Looks like white lightning.

That'll do the trick.

What's shaking, Dale?
Hey, Karl.

You ready to go
get that sucker?

Ready to get down
to the creek...

...get him right between the eyes.

Look at him.
Fat-ass peckerdick.

That's what I like
about you, boy.

Got him a new boy.

I don't give a shit.

Take the truck if you want to.

I'm gonna go get me a beer.

Blow his guts out
is all I wanna do.

Got enough to work
both sides of the river?

Just like old times.

Get him by the scrote bag...

...cut that son of a bitch off
and tan it for a tobacco pouch.

Well, suit yourself.

You're gonna need
something out there.

Here comes the sheriff.

Everybody get out the way.

...and let this man
get in here and speak.

All right, let's get
this thing moving.

Billy, you got a full tank?

Just got her filled up
this morning, boss.

We're ready to go.

Dale, you got your gate unlocked?

Yeah.
Good.

They found Fred and Darleen murdered
in their bed this morning!

Fred had an antler through his ribcage...

Darleen was ripped to shreds!

Said they couldn't even
recognize her!

Had to be that wildman.

Let's lynch that
son of a bitch!

Let's gut him like we did
that hog last week.

Run him down, boys.
Let's get him.

Jack him up!

Let's go!

We're gonna go out yonder,
make our way back west.

The boys are gonna
head south on the bank...

...see what they can stir up.

Somewhere between there,
we oughta bring it down.

And Dale, just so you know,
none of us blame you for any of this.

You and I both know

...that those weren't bullet holes
in your daddy.

We know that you're clean
as a hen's tooth, Dale...

...and the truth is all coming out
this afternoon.

Yeah. When the buzzards
start circling.

Let's get him!

Let's make a rug
out of that son of a bitch!

Come on, boys!

Let's go, let's go!

Unload! Come on, boys!

Come on, come on!

Come on.

All right, fellers,
I'm gonna go in here...

...circle through this bottom.

You hear a bunch of shooting,
run around to the flats.

...as fast as you can and cut him off.

What if I hear you screaming?

God, don't say that,
you ignorant son of a bitch.

Good luck.

Look like he's been eating.

Sure has, 'bout all gone.

He'll do the same thing to us
if he gets a chance.

I think I heard something.

I bet he travels this creek.

I knew you went this way.

I got you now,
you son of a bitch.

He's headed down to the river, boys!
Get him!

There it is!

It's heading south!

Can't get a shot.

Earl, I'm gonna cut him off
at the river bottom!

Come on, boy!

There he is, there he is!

He's making for the river!

All right, I got, I got
a sight on him right now!

Ride him down, ride him down!

Can you get a shot at him?

No, I can't see him.

I need six horses, go on!

Get on in there!

Shoot him down!

Get across that river bottom
to that other side and cut him off.

Don't you dare let that
son of a bitch get away.

I'll get him, I'll get him!

Kill him! Kill him! Get him!
Where'd he go?

If you can't kill him, wound him...

...cripple the son of a bitch.

There he is.

Christ almighty.
Is it dead?

I've never seen anything
like that before in my life.

Dang, I can't tell what it is
from right here.

I don't know whether
it's a man or an animal.

It don't look natural.

Look at them tusks
on that son of a gun.

Preacher, I want you just to stand
up close next to Dale there.

I'll get a picture of all three of you
right in front of this guy.

Why don't y'all get together
and take a picture together?

It's over.
Finally.

They say he's eaten horses?

Yeah, he's been
eating horses.

God almighty.

Sure is ugly.

Smells like they killed him
three days ago.

Can we get one more
of you and that gun?

At least he's dead, dead, dead.

Good riddance.

God damn!
Good riddance to bad rubbish!

Preacher can't save him...

...maybe the devil can.

Amen.

to take my cares away #

# And something got
a hold on me #

# I gave my soul to glory
on that riverbank #

# Lord, something got
a hold on me #

# I gave my soul to glory
on that riverbank #

# And something got
a hold on me #

# And something got a hold
on me, sweet Jesus #

# Something got a hold on me #

# I was praying to the Master
to take my cares away #

# And something got
a hold on me #

# And something got a hold
on me, sweet Jesus #

# Something got a hold on me #

# I was praying to the Master
to take my cares away #

# And something got
a hold on me #

# I went under the water
to wash my sins away #

# And something
got a hold on me #

# I went under the water
to wash my sins away #

# And something
got a hold on me #

# And something got a hold
on me, sweet Jesus #

# Something got a hold on me #

# I was praying to the Master
to take my cares away #

# And something got
a hold on me #

# Yeah, something got
a hold on... #
