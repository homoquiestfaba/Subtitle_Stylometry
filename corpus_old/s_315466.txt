Okay, Shinobu! Come in

Tatsuya!

Kazuya! Look at me

Minami! Look at me

Tatsuya Kazuya Here we go!

We've always been together
since we were born

People said we were like triplets

Tatsuya Uesugi

Kazuya Uesugi

They were twins

I'm Minami Asakura

Happy days passed by like dreams

Our fathers loved baseball

We followed them

I'm back!

Two outs, bases loaded,
in the seventh

Koshien Stadium abruptly
appeared before us

To participate in the championship
tournament became our dream

Punch

Come here

The three kids messed up
their houses

Our parents built a joint
playhouse for us

My mother said

If only we could I ive this
way forever

I need someone who catches my ball

You need hard training to go to
Koshien Stadium

I know Girls can't play
baseball there

Take me there

Take me to Koshien

< TOUCH >

I'll be going

Hi, Punch!

Hi, Kazuya

Hi, Minami

You look cool

Why is the winner's picture
so small?

Get ready

Morning, Mom

Hi, stupid!

I slept late

Very, Tatsuya

All comic books!

Never mind textbooks

They're at school

Your uniform?

Where is it?

Why can't you use a hanger?

Let me go through!

A crumpled hankie

it's wet and smells!

Give it to me!

Bro!

I'd be late

I'm hungry

Because you slept late

Dump your stuffed animals

None of your concern

Devi I

Devi I

You're mean

Devi I
Bro!

Devi I

You'll turn into a toad

No
Yes

No
Yes

Devi I

Bro!

Meisei High School

Under protection of
aristocrats and merchants

It means the hobby of the rich

Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa
was a result of such a hobby

The hobby produced culture

This Mona Lisa in the textbook

She's a glamorous type

Tatsuya

What lesson are you taking?

Your teacher's class?

He was watching the girls

Shut up, baldhead!

What?

Kotaro

Baldhead!

Kotaro!

Don't eat in class!

I'm sorry

It breaks well Terrific!

Very fast, too

About 87 mph

Uesugi! Go!

Catch it! Catch it!

You did it!

Go home now

You've taken a lot of pictures

Remember I'm not soft

Nice pitch

Nice pitching

Next, fastball

Tatsuya

Take it easy!

Tatsuya

Going home so soon?

You want to pitch?

I saw you in the Little League

You've got a nice throwing arm

Join my team

Your brother shut them out

He'll go to Koshien

He's made the team invincible

Harada, stop jabbering!

Or no supper!

Go to cheer him?

No

Why not?

Don't worry Minami did

Does a blow hurt you?

No

it's a lie

Rather

Once the gong sounds, nothing
matters

Only boxers know by experience

Stay back

Be sure

Let's talk

Lina!

Let's go

I told you to stay back

I'm sorry

Blame yourself

I'm sorry

Change your clothes

What did you do? So dirty all over!

You really know what you're doing?

Yes, I do

Don't you have a dream?

Anything you want to do
in the future?

You've always been like that

Doing this and that, without
a steadfast purpose

Are you listening?

What a fool!

It hurts

Ecole de Paris,
a group of artists after WW1

Minami, have some tea

Thank you

These amulets are nice

Very cute

How many will you make?

Twenty

So many? Hard work

This is Enoshima Island

I'm not good at sewing

You do it allright

So I stealthily went upstairs

They were discussing seriously
who'd marry Minami

They were schoolboys

You have the right to choose

Which one would?

Tatsuya? Kazuya? Who'd marry me?

The one who takes you to Koshien

You know, I started boxing practice

Boxing?!

Why boxing?

Why not baseball?

Why are you angry?

Your fastball was great

It swished as you threw it

Speed is a talent

Breaking balls depend on practice

Why did you quit baseball?

Because of me?

Why you?

Look! Terrific, isn't it?

Lina shows all

One more minute

Asakura

Let's go

Thanks

Like a tough guy

Meisei Keeps Going

Meisei Wins Again!

What's this?

Lt's dead!

You're no good

A punching bag

Never mind

No problem

Today's match We gotta win!

Don't sllp down, ass!

The last ball!

Strikeout! That's his fast
sllder!

Uesugiled Meisei to the final

Stay on the mat

Hello

He forgot this

He left after the match

He practiced very hard

He was serious

But he lost?

He tried his best

He looked cool

Thanks

Hello

Kazuya's in a good condition

My father's compllment

How heavy!

Best beef from Kobe

Let's make Sukiyaki

How was Tatsuya?

The boxing team secretary came

Tatsuya lost the game but
he tried hard

He did his best

Supper!

Sukiyaki for supper

No, thanks

The match is over No more diet

Harada coached me

You did your best

No problem

it's not so simple

What should I say?

A sweetie would

smack a kiss without a word

Take three meals a day

Harada! Get moving!

Why are you so cool?

What about?

What about?

What's that? Is that so simple
a thing to you?

Say something

Why did you kiss me?

Don't do it on a whim

it's not that

It was for you

Just for you, Tatsuya

Ishigaki, left fielder

Just knock a grounder and run

Thanks for the advice

Nakajima, shortstop

Hit the first ball

Hit a home run

As always!

Not as always

Lastly, Asakura, scorer

Take a rest today for the
game tomorrow

Get over your fatigue

One more game to Koshien

Kazuya

Let's do it

Nitta is a slugger

0750. His average is 0750
In the ellmination

I'm not surprised

You faced him before?

Yes Just once in junior high

I shut him out

Minami Another round

Eat some sandwich

But you can't tell what'll
happen next

Don't worry I assure you.
You'll win

Will the goddess of victory
kiss me?

Oh, no

Kazuya will have a game tomorrow

Tatsuya, you have nothing
to do today?

We're short of hands Join my
team for a day. I'll pay forit

Why are you here? I'd get
only half my pay

You bring Kazuya?

He'll have the final tomorrow

He just came

Too large for me

Is it washed clean?

Bro

How about a bet?

The winner will get what he wants

Take it easy, Kazuya

Strike!

Oh, no He's a jewel in a dunghill

I'm sorry

Strike!

Don't worry

The Sumi High batters
are immune to breaking balls

You can fan them

Just don't have a runner on
base before Nitta

You're in a good condition

lt'll be hot tomorrow

Go to bed now Team secretaries
must get up ear ly in the morning

Tough work, but

Take it easy

Let's hang in there

Minami

Remember what I said in the cafe?

Will you kiss me?

Just as a charm

Then I'll be able to sleep

Good night, secretary

You want to play catch?

Thanks

Gone

Bro, I

I kissed Minami

On the forehead

Why report that to me?

Right

Even kids kiss on the forehead

Take her

To Koshien Stadium

That's your task

You want to see

her smiling face?

Win the game

Never lose it!

I thought you were here

You could have invited me

Let's play triangular catch

Yes, let's!

We used to do this every day

All day until dusk

What interested us?

Well, I was fascinated

Aunt Haruko was angry because
we were late

She came

Minami

The memories are dear to me

Here we go!

Fight!

Here we go!

One more!

Minami

Minami

Are you allright?

Are you al right?

Hang on!

You hear me?

Are you allright?

Take it easy

Uesugi will come

Let's hang in there till then

Nitta gets to his feet

The slugger is at bat with
runners on bases

Come on, cheer up!

Uesugi absent? Why?

He hit it hard!

To the right field!

Deep! Deep!

Gone! A home run!

The excited supporters!

The pitcher gives way to the mound

The homer has cleared the bases

Sumi High wins 4-3

The team is going to Koshien
for the 17th time

Kazuya Kazuya

Can't belleve it

He's dead

Sumi High Wins Championship at Koshien

Uesugi!

A nice job for you

He's offering a bet

You pitch; he swings

It pays 10, 000 yen

If struck out, another 10, 000

You throw, that's all. A good deal

If I win, you'll join my team

He's captain He needs a pitcher

My last request

If you win, I won't bother you again

Genuine

Will he make it?

It depends

Naka j ima, drop the ball
at the waist!

Why all this?

What do you want?

Baseball

Liar

You didn't tell me

I don't have to consult you

Can't I play baseball?

No! Look at the mi rror

Your whim can cause a shock
to the others

Do I look like Kazuya?

Naturally

You, too?

Stupid!

Too bad!

In a uniform, he's Kazuya

So what?

I'm Kazuya's partner, and
he's not Kazuya

You intentionally lost the bet

I am exhausted this week

Let me see

Poor hands!

But they'll become tough that way

Did you know?

Of course You're team secretary

I found these under his bed.
He hid them there

He tells me nothing

Can't he trust his own mother?

Lt's not that

Minami

Won't you tell him to quit baseball?

Wait a minute

Why ask her that?

Why can't Tatsuya play baseball?

Why did you quit boxing?

You went for it Wasn't it fun?

You're mistaken

You're not Kazuya
You don't have to bear his life

I know

You don't

I like baseball, so I play it.
Can't I?

No You don't understand

Minami, persuade him

Please!

Uesugi

Take it easy

Is it fun?

Throw

Kotaro, catch

No

Kotaro!

He can't be a pitcher

Not to me

Somebody, catch his ball

I will

No You're in danger

He's not a kid

Minami Asakura

You afraid?

Never mind hurting me

Be serious!

Is that your fastball?

Give it to me

Thanks

Hey

You never get tired?

Nitta of Sumi High

It sounds familiar

Don't you know?

Sumi High won the championship

The credit goes to Nitta

The freshman is the number-one slugger

We faced him, too

At the final

About today

Thanks a lot
