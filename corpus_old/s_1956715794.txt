[siren wailing in distance]

[siren grows louder]

[siren fades]

Jude?


Jude. I'm home.

[beeping continues]

[sustained beep]

Turn off the video games.

[keys clattering]


Gotcha!

[roars]
[squeals]

Shit!
[giggles]

Why do you have to keep doing this?

I got you good, didn't I?

You think
you're funny, huh?

Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Okay.

[phone buzzes]
Saved by your dad.

Hi.
Dad.

<i>What's up, mate?</i>

<i>You being the big man of the
house and taking care of your mum?</i>

More like scaring
his old mom.

I used the shoe trick.

<i>The shoe trick.
Now, let me see.</i>

<i>No, I think you must be mistaking
me with someone else, mate.</i>

Real sneaky, you two.

<i>I can't stay long, love.</i>

<i>I've gotta take some clients
out for dinner.</i>

<i>But I just wanted to check in
on my two favorite people,</i>

<i>and let you know that I miss you
both and I love you guys so much.</i>

Love you, Dad.
<i>Bye, kiddo.</i>

Later!

You know, it's the third time
this week you've been late.

<i>I know, I know.</i>

<i>I've just got to finish these
deadlines, then I'm done. I promise.</i>

<i>When I get back,</i>

<i>maybe I can find a way
to make it up to you.</i>

Well, Friday night,
we do have the nanny.

<i>Oh. Well, then I will see you
on Friday night, lady.</i>

If you're lucky.
[chuckles]

Night.
<i>Good night, love.</i>

Were you really scared, Mom?

I was.

But next time,
let's get your dad.


Looks like Mr. Brown
could use a cuddle.

Mom.
Hmm?

I'm too old to still sleep
with a teddy bear.

Well, I won't tell
if you won't.

Good night.

Good night, Mom.

[door closes]

[floor creaking]



Jude?

[loud clattering]

If you're trying to scare me
again, it's not funny.

Okay.

Mom!

What are you doing?

Mom, don't!


[screaming continues]

No! No!
[alarm blaring]

Jude!

Jude!


[shouting continues]
[man groans]

Mommy!

look at some of those toys today.

Or perhaps there's something
you'd like to talk about?

You don't like coming here
very much, do you?

But you do understand
why you're here?

You know, Jude,
if you'd like to go,

all you need to do is to say,
"I'd like to go now."

Five months isn't an unusual time
for this kind of selective mutism.

I've seen children
stop talking for much longer

from much less severe trauma.

Encourage him to communicate,
but try not to force it.

It has to come from him.

The more we force things,
the more he's gonna pull back.

And how are the two of you
holding up?

We're good, yeah.

As well as we can be.

We're really just trying to focus
on Jude's recovery right now.

Well, I commend
your dedication.

But Jude is looking
to you now.

And if you're not getting
better, he won't get better.

Thank you.


Another headache?

It's not that bad.

I thought the doctor
had some good things to say.

Yeah.

I think Jude
is a little better.

No. I meant, actually,
about us healing too.

Well, I'm... fine, really.

You never leave the house.

You have nightmares
every night,

and you don't even
let me touch you.

I'm... not having
this conversation again.

We've never had
this conversation.

You've never talked about
what happened or how you feel.

What if we went away?

Out of the city,
someplace quiet.

You're already homeschooling Jude.
I can work wherever.

I think it would be a good chance
for us to have a fresh start.

I'll think about it.

What is it, sweetheart?


Liza!
[choking]

Liza, be quiet!

Liza.

Liza.

Liza. Liza. It's okay.

[Liza gasping]

It's okay. You're all right.

[Jude crying softly]

I'm sorry, sweetheart.

It's okay.

I can't do this anymore.

[chain squeaking]

Hiya! I'm Pamela.

Oh, I'm glad you found it.

Shall I show you the house?

And what's
this little man's name?


He's a little shy.

I bet we'll be best of friends in no time.

This used to be a guesthouse
of a much larger property.

But after the owner of
the manor house passed away,

some city man, no offense,
came and scooped it up.

I think
he was gonna restore it,

but I imagine the job
got too much for him.

Lucky for you folks,
though.

Some time
in the countryside.

It's perfect.

I'll give you a little tour
if you like.

No. I think we can
handle it from here.

Oh. All right.

Thank you.
Take care.

Cheers. Bye-bye.

[door opens, closes]

So, what do you think?

It's beautiful.

Yeah? You sure?
Yes.

And what about you,
big boss?


All right.

I vote we try a little...

nature exploration!

[man] Isn't it beautiful?
[Liza] Yeah, it's so quiet.

Look at the sun.

Smell the air.
That's fresh air.

I bet we'll see loads
of rabbits come spring.

Maybe even some deer, huh?
[Liza] Yeah.

It's slippery.


That must be
the main house.

Let's check it out.

Look at that.

Wow. Now, that is
what I call a house.

Come here.

Come on, Jude.

[child's voice, faint]
<i>Jude.</i>

Wow.

This place must've been quite
something back in the day.

"Glennview Estate."

[child's voice]
<i>Jude, come play with us.</i>

<i>Jude.</i>

<i>Come here, Jude. Over here.</i>

<i>Jude.</i>

<i>Come over here.</i>

<i>Now, Jude.</i>

We'll have to look it up.

Old house like this probably
got some real history to it.


<i>Jude, Jude. Help me, Jude.</i>

<i>Jude, Jude, Jude.</i>

<i>Yes, Jude.</i>

Yeah, forget the guesthouse.

I'm moving in here.

What do you say, Jude?

Jude?

Jude!
Jude?

Jude!

Mate, don't run off
like that, please.

You can't run off like that,
not out here.

What's that?

Did you just find that?

Can I take a look?

Oh, my goodness.
It's filthy. Look at it.

Whereabouts
did you find it?

Do you wanna keep it?

Okay. Let's get it
cleaned up first.

All right. Can't wait to have
this guy in the house.

Can I see?

"Rules."

Huh.

I bet you have
a story to tell.

Looks like
he wants a friend.

He looks like
he was broken before...

and put back together again.

Okay, let's go to bed now.
Hmm?

Come on, mate.

You sure you got everything you need
there, little fella? Yeah?

You just make yourself at home.
Put your feet up.

There's nice, cold beer
in the fridge.

I could use
some of those pj's.

[Liza chuckles]

[piano: "Brahms Lullaby"]

["Brahms Lullaby" continues]

You dressed him yourself.

That sounds lovely.

Are you hungry?

Okay.

I'll make pancakes.

["Brahms Lullaby" continues]

I guess it's about time for me
to start my morning commute,

all the way down the hallway.

I really hope
there's no traffic, guys.

You wanna stop by the office
for lunch today?

Did I mention that I was
just down the hallway?

I'll try to sneak by.

Goodbye, Judester.
Mwah.

And goodbye, uh...

Did we come up
with a name for him yet?

[pen scratching on paper]

"Brahms." Wow.

Like the composer?

That's quite the name.
How'd you come up with that?

Oh, he told you.
Right, yeah.

Well, of course, he did.
Silly me.

All right. Bye, gang.

Goodbye, Brahms.

Well, what should we
start with today,

math or history?

[door closes]

Okay.

[child's voice] <i>Over here.</i>


<i>Right here.</i>

<i>This way.</i>

Jude!

I told you not
to run off like that.

This is where you found him?

[barking]
[screams]

Oz, get in here.

This is private property.

I'm sorry. We're staying
at the guesthouse.

We were just on a walk.
I didn't know.

Of course you didn't.
You're the new family.

Sorry, I get a lot of people
snooping around up here.

I'm Joseph. Joe.

Um, I tend the grounds
around here.

Part guard, part gardener. This is Oz.
[Oz whimpers]

I'm Liza.

And this is Jude.

[Oz growling]

[growling continues]

We can put the doll back.

Do you want us...

No, no, no, no.

Keep it. No one's
gonna miss it out here.

Just me and Oz these days.

Unless, of course,
you'd like to put it back?

He's a little quiet.

Don't worry about that.
Not much of a talker meself.

People think I'm crazy
for living out here on my own,

but I'm more sane
than any of them.

The real crazies are living in the city,
packed together like a bunch of cattle.

Thank you,
but no, thank you.

You didn't really have to
walk us all the way back.

Ah, I don't mind.
We're neighbors now.

I suppose I'll be seeing
quite a bit of you.


That's a healthy-looking
12 gauge.

Or a 12 bore.

I was worried about you.

This is Joseph.

Joseph, this is
my husband, Sean.

Hiya.
Joseph...

I tend the grounds round here.
Keep the troublemakers out.

Caught these two red-handed.

Yeah, these two are trouble,
all right.

Well, thanks
for escorting them back.

Right. I'll be off, then.
Let me know if you need anything, yeah?

Yeah. Nice meeting you.

Pleasure was all mine.

See you soon, little fella.

Bringing home the local strays
already, huh?

He's right there.

[Oz growling]

walking us all the way home.

Come on, Oz. Come on.

Nice of him, I guess.

Who the hell buries a doll
in the woods like that?

Maybe some weird little kid
put it there.

I don't know, sweetheart.

Yeah, but you weren't there.
You didn't see it.

His entire wardrobe,
in this...

coffin thing.

Okay.
So, what do you wanna do?

You wanna take the doll away from him?
Yes.

No.

I don't know.

I just think
it's all a little bit...

creepy.

I really don't think it's the
doll that's the problem here.

What does that mean?

Nothing. Let's just
finish the dishes, yeah?

I've got some work to do
before we go to sleep.

No, I wanna hear
what you were about to say.

What's the problem?

Sometimes I feel like
you use Jude...

to avoid talking about
what happened to you.

And I don't think that's
healthy for either of you.

[Jude's voice] <i>Mommy!</i>

You know, I nearly died...

in some random,
senseless burglary.

And I'm actually aware of that
every single day of my life.

Yes, but that's over now.
[kettle whistling]

Li...

You didn't like the dog?

The dog.

Dogs bark.

I know what you mean.
He was kind of scary.

Liza, I'm sorry.

Shh, shh, shh.

[Jude chattering]

Holy shit.

Should we just leave him alone?
Do you wanna open the door?

No, I wanna go in. I wanna
see if he'll talk to us.

Okay. Let's go.

So, all this is yours?


We were just outside,
and we thought we heard you talking.

Were you talking
to Brahms?

Great.

So, what were you guys
talking about?

The dog from this morning.

Did he scare you?

"Brahms doesn't like him."

Oh.

Well, that's...

that's great.

We'll let you get back
to Brahms.

Good night.

Thinking about watching a
movie, if you're interested.

Oh, yeah.

Sure.

I guess we're
keeping that doll.

Are you kidding? I love that creepy thing.
[chuckling]


[growling continues]


[faint whispering]

[whispering continues]

[whispering stops]


[gasps]
[man grunting]

Liza, it's okay.
Honey, it's okay. Look at me.

It was just a dream.

Look at me.
It's fine. You're okay.

[panting]
Jude.

Jude, I'm sorry.

He's mine!

You okay?
Another nightmare?

Where's Jude?

He slept in his room,
love.

[Liza sighs]

This is the first time
he's slept in his own bed.


Let's go back to bed.

[door closes]

[Oz whining]

Do you want two, yeah?

Does Brahms want two?

Hey, good morning.
You're up.

I let you lie in.

It seemed like
you could use it.

Thank you.

Cooked up
a little Full English.

Here you go, love.

What's this?
Oh, that. Yes.

Well, apparently, Brahms
is handing down rules now,

including
he'd like his own food.

"Always and forever"?

Oh, dear.

What happened
to Mr. Brown?

Jude, buddy,

did you do this?

Come on, mate.

It's not very nice
to blame him now, is it?

Look, we're not mad at you.

But this is no way
to treat your things.

And it's never okay to lie.

So, did you cut up
Mr. Brown?

Okay. Then why don't you go to your
room and finish your homework there?

And then when you're ready to tell
me what happened, you can come out.

You can leave
the doll here.


You heard your mum.
Leave the doll, please.

Maybe it's a good thing.
He's getting his anger out.

[door creaks, closes]

It's pretty violent.

[static hissing]

[hissing continues]

Really?

That wasn't funny.

You're supposed
to stay in this room

and not come out again until
you're ready to apologize.

Fine. You can stay in here
for the rest of the day, then.

Aaah!



[rhythmic thumping]


[running footsteps]

[door closes]

[lock clicks]

Jude,

your father and I
said no doll.

Okay, I am gonna count to three,
and if this door isn't open...

One...

two...

three.

What are you doing here?



I have someone here
who wants to apologize.

Come on.

Hey.

Thank you for apologizing.

Okay. Let's get you
to bed, yeah?

Go brush your teeth.
Good boy.

You okay?

Not good.

I could've sworn I saw somebody
go into his room, and then...

You didn't. It's fine.

Honestly, his pranks
are getting out of hand.

Yeah, but I thought
everything would be better

once we got out of the city.

I don't know what to do.

I just feel like
I'm letting you and Jude down.

You're not
letting anyone down.

Please don't be sorry.

You'll feel better
after some sleep.

Yeah.

Good night.

All right.


[door opens, closes]

<i>I understand that some of Jude's
recent behaviors would be upsetting.</i>

<i>But the doll clearly is providing him
with a safe outlet to process his trauma.</i>

<i>Now comes the hard part,
where he might try to act out some more.</i>


Listen, what if we just
got rid of the doll?

How bad would that be?

<i>I urge you to be patient</i>

<i>and allow him
to have his friend.</i>

<i>He's found a place with this
doll where he feels safe.</i>

<i>And the last thing we want
to do is take that away.</i>

<i>I'll send you some links
with further information.</i>

Okay. Sounds good.

Thanks, doc. We'll speak
to you soon, yeah?

<i>Okay. Take care.</i>

[computer beeping]


There you go. Nice.

Come on, Jude.

That's it. Once.
Then move it on.

Perfect.


What you got there?

Okay.

You thought of a name
for him yet?

What is it?

[pen scratching on paper]

Course it is.

Because that's his name, isn't it?
What else would it be?

You've scrubbed up well,
little man.

So, I see you've found
yourself a new family.

little fella?

Just look at that expression
on his face.

It's like he's got a secret
that only he knows.

[door closes]
Do you ever notice that?

Can I help you?

Hello there.

I was just looking for Oz,
my daft dog.

We haven't seen him.

All right, never mind.

Pretty good idea
where he'll be, anyway.

Right, I'll be off.

You be good now.

Come on.
It's time to go inside.

outside all alone?

I just left him for a second.


[breathing deeply]

[gasps, screaming]


[Jude] What happened?
I'm sorry.

I just saw it.
It was just there.

I'm sorry.
[Sean] My God, Liza.

What are you doing?


Jude?

"I'll always be with you"?

"They will be sorry."


Sorry.

I didn't know
you were standing there.

Why are you wearing that?

Dinner's in 15.


[clock chiming]

No. It's just the three of us
for dinner tonight, Jude.

No, not tonight.

Does it really matter,
Liza?

Your mum said no, mate.

So, I was thinking of inviting Liam
out, and the family.

Felt like maybe
we could use some company.

No? You wanna see your Uncle Liam,
Auntie Mary and your cousins?

I think it'll be fun.
He's always a good laugh, isn't he?

I think he'd love
to get out of the city.

Not really guests.

They're family.

Yeah?

Your dad and I make the rules
in this house, not your doll.

Mm-mmm. Eat it.

All right, come on.
Enough.

No, it's fine.

You can sit here until you
decide you can eat your food.

Just do as your mum says,
please.

[Sean whispering]
Look, I can handle this.

[Liza whispering] It's okay.
It's fine. You have work to do.

Well, if you won't talk to
me, will the doll?

That's because Brahms
is not a person.

He's not real.

He doesn't need any food.
You do.

The doll and his rules
do not run this house.

Fine.
Stay here all night, then.

[inhales, exhales]

[loud clattering]


What?

Jude.

Jude.

Liza, what in the hell
happened?

Look, I believe you,
I do.

It's just...

So, some scary drawings.

It's not really surprising, is it?
Considering what he's been through.

The drawing of the dog.

The dog?

There is no dog here.

There was one. And others.

Sean, there was a drawing of Jude
standing over our dead bodies

and he was holding a gun.

So you're saying he ripped
pages out of his book?

No, I...

I don't know what happened.

I just know that I want
that doll out of our house.

I need to think about this.

No, I don't want it here.

I don't like
what it's doing to Jude.

What?

I mean, all of this.

This is a lot for a little
kid, don't you think?

This isn't a light table,
for starters.

Are you asking me
if I did this?

Somebody's done this.
You're the only person in here with him.

is happening to him.

And it started with that doll.

the doll in the morning, okay?

do about them, Brahms?

Oz! Where are you, boy?

Come here, Oz. Come here, boy.

[flies buzzing]

Oh, Oz.

Lovely. I need that.
Thank you.

Ready?

Yeah. Let's do it.

Morning, mister.


Sean.

Jude!

Come on, buddy!

It's not funny, Jude!

I'll go this way.

You head off that way.
Okay.

We'll circle round.
We'll meet back at the house.

Jude!

Jude!


[flies buzzing]

[voices whispering]

[door closes]
[whispering stops]

[running footsteps]

[faint laughing]

Jude?


Jude?

[faint whispering resumes]

Jude.

Jude?

[voices whispering]

Jude? Is that you?

Jude, what are you doing?


[rodents squeaking]

Jude, where are you?


Over here.

Come play with us, Mommy.

[bats screeching]
[Liza screams]


[voices chattering, laughing]

[scraping]
[dirt falling]

Jude?

[wood creaking]


Jude.

I'm sorry I scared you.

We were just playing, Mommy.
It's so good to hear your voice.

[loud thud]


There you are.

Been looking all over for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?


you doing in here? It's not safe.

I'm sorry, Daddy.

Jude, he's...

You're talking.

Right, let's go.

We're not really supposed to
be in this part of the house.

Come on.

to hear you talking.

what happened in this house?

Jude, why don't you go
show Brahms the music room?

Stay close, mate.

There, uh...

There was a family that
lived here a long time ago.

Had a son, went a bit mad.

Killed a little girl.

Got burnt up in fire.
Wore a mask to hide it.

Lived inside the walls
of the house for 30 years.

Never came out.

The Heelshires?

Yeah, the Heelshires.

And?

And the parents
committed suicide.

Drowned themselves.

It's a very sad story.


messy after the parents had gone.

He killed a man,
very nearly two others,

before he was killed himself.

But they're all dead
and buried now.

What's the son's name?

His name was Brahms.

Did you say Brahms?

I didn't mean to keep it from you.

I just didn't think
it'd ever come up.

Thank you for telling us.

It's time to go home.

Hey, Joseph?

Did you ever find your dog?

Yes, I did.

I'm afraid Oz was found
gutted in the forest.

I'm sorry to hear that.

<i>So, your parents tell me
you've been talking again.</i>

<i>Is this your new friend
Brahms?</i>

<i>He seems like
a very nice friend.</i>

<i>What are some of the things
you talk about?</i>

He... tells me
all sorts of things.

Sometimes he tells me about the
other families he's lived with.

<i>Oh. Has he lived
with a lot of families?</i>

He wants to live
with us now.

He was very angry that Mommy and
Daddy wanted to take him away.

<i>Oh.</i>

<i>And when Brahms gets angry,</i>

<i>does he say he wants to
hurt someone or something?</i>

<i>Is there something he wants
to tell your mum and dad?</i>

<i>Well, if Jude had something
to do with the dog's death,</i>

<i>then this is a lot more
serious than we thought.</i>

<i>The doll might be enabling him
to shift blame</i>

<i>for all the bad things
that he might do.</i>

<i>I think it would be a good idea
for me to see him face-to-face.</i>

<i>When do you think you can
bring him down to London?</i>

We've got guests coming today,
but we'll bring him as soon as we can.

<i>All right, then.</i>

<i>But I urge you,
keep a close eye on him in the meanwhile.</i>

[no audible dialogue]


Anything goes. Make yourself at home.
[Mary] Thank you.

This is just fabulous!
I love it.

Hello.

Well, look. There he is.

You remember your old Uncle
Liam, don't you?

Hey.
[Will] What? It's not my fault he's mental.


And...
who's this handsome chap?

Brahms.

Well. Hello there, Brahms.
Pleased to meet you.

Any friend of Jude's
is a friend of mine.

why don't we go outside and play

while we all have a catch-up.


There's nothing to do outside.

There's nature. All right?

It's like a video game,
but real. Go, enjoy.

Show them around.

Maybe I should go with them.
Nonsense. They'll be fine.

Just stay close
to the house, guys.

This is so cool.
Shut up.

I like your doll.

Thanks.

This place sucks.
There's nothing to do here.

We could play croquet.

I wanna play.
Come on.

Don't touch him, Sophie.
He's mental.

No, I'm not.

My parents say you talk to that
doll, like it's a real person.

Because you went crazy
when your mum got attacked.

And we're not supposed
to notice.

Will!

But they know you're mental.

And I know you're mental.

And your stupid doll,

he's the most mental of all.

He's fine, Liza.

Have some wine.

It'll do him good to hang out
with some other children.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

Ever since it happened,
I just...

I can't seem to relax.

Hey, you're with family now.

You don't have anything
to worry about.

And Will won't let
anything happen.

Hey, you're breaking it!

Shut up, nutter.
Stop it, Will!

Oh, you're sticking up
for your nutter boyfriend now.

Maybe I should
just smash your doll.

Maybe that will make you normal again.
Don't.

[Mary chuckles]
We get to this party,

and we have literally
just walked in the door,

and his pants split
right in the bum.

And not just a little tear,
the whole bum!

I'm going to tell Mum!

She'll probably be happy.

Don't touch him.

Or what?

Or he'll make you wish
you never came here.

Did you buy him purple boxers?


Kinky.

It's good to see
that smile again, Liza.

That old smile of yours.

Give it back!
Nah, I don't think I will.

Give it back to her.

Ooh, now your boyfriend's mad.

Why don't you come get it
from me, mental?

about this doll thing.

Will used to be obsessed
with this blanket.

Run, mental, run.

Stop it, Will!


Then one day I realized that it was
quite literally a security blanket.

I think this doll
could be the same thing.

Come on, mental.

You shouldn't worry about it,
is what I'm saying.

Kids do all sorts
of weird things.

They go through phases.

And then poof, it's gone.

[both grunting]


[Sophie screaming]

Oh, my God.
What? What's going on?


Easy, on three. One, two, three.
[Will crying]


Slowly. Slowly.

with his head, okay?

[Mary] Will, I'm coming in.
[crying continues]

Sophie, get in the front.

Sweetheart, why don't you
drink some of this?

It'll help you sleep.

A nap will do you good.

Okay?

There you go.

Mommy.

Everything's okay.

He won't let me go.

He wants me to live in the
big house with him forever.

He said he'd kill you and
Daddy if I didn't do it.

He said that?

When did he say that?

He says it all the time.

I can't control him
anymore.

He keeps getting stronger.

Well,

no one's gonna hurt
Mommy and Daddy.

And no one's gonna hurt you.

Okay?


[line beeps]

Hey, Liza, it's me.

We just saw the doctor.
I think Will's gonna be okay.

So, I'll call you
from the car.

All right.
I love you. Bye.

are you?

I'm staying
at the Glennview Estates.

Glennview?

Oh, you mean the Heelshire place.

Christ, you couldn't pay me
money to stop there.

You what?
You don't know?

Whole family went
completely mad out there.

Something to do with a son living
inside the walls for years.

You see, but that's not the only
thing that happened out there.

There were other
tragedies before.

Back in the '50s, a kid killed
his own mother and brother,

convinced a doll
was speaking to him.

And it's still going on.

Last year, that city man that
bought it after the Heelshires

went a bit mad
and disappeared.

Never heard from again.

I saw him down the pub
one time.

Old crazy Joe.

Crazy Joe?

That's what people
called him, mind.

His name were Joseph...

Oh, my God. Jude!

Jude!

Jude!

Jude!

Didn't have to be like this.


Is Jude okay?

Don't worry. He's safe.

Safer now than he's probably
ever been in his life.

Why are you here?

I'm here because
he wants me to be.

Who?

Brahms.

He doesn't like it like this,
but you've done it to yourself.

I just wanna know
where my son is.

I will do anything you want.
Just give me my son.

I want you to listen!

He wants you to listen!

You asked me why I'm here.

It's the same reason
that you are.

He called me.

He calls out to the ones
that need him.

The damaged ones.

He looks inside you.

It was just a whisper...

at first,

when I first came here.

So quiet.

And he was in pieces
when I found him,

broken.

And then the voice said...

to put him back together.

So I did.

Then I heard him,
growing inside.

You must've heard it.

Jude sure has. Oh, yeah.

I don't know what Brahms is,

but you can stop this.

It's too late.

Brahms and Jude are gonna be
one, and it'll be beautiful.

Everybody thought
that I was crazy.

They thought the Heelshires were
crazy, but, oh, no.

It's always been the doll.

Even before the house, before the
Davies, the ones before that.

I found all their old letters.

He knew that you were coming.

He knew your boy
would find him.

That's why he told me
to bury him.

They're always so curious, aren't they?
The little ones are like...

like moths to a flame.

Joseph, where is my son?

I wanna see my son!

He's in the big house!

Jude!

Jude!

Jude!

Jude.

Jude?

[voice whispering]
<i>Over here.</i>

[voices whispering]

[woman's voice]
<i>This way.</i>

[hinges squeaking]

<i>We're just over here.</i>

[metallic thud]

[flames roaring]

Jude...

I know you don't
wanna hurt anybody.

This isn't you, Jude.

Please, put him down.

It's going to be okay.

Can I hold Brahms?

I used to hold you
just like this.

Let's just put him down.

Hello, Mommy.

Jude, put the gun down.

We're very angry.

You and Daddy
have been getting in the way.

We're going to
live here now...

because you can't protect us.

Protect you from who?

That dog.

Will.

And those men from that night.
[screams]

You're right.

We do need Brahms to protect us.
It's too late.

You've given us no choice.

Goodbye, Mommy.

I know Brahms
is telling you what to say.

Which is why we need to
take him home with us.

Brahms needs to be
a member of our family.

And what kind of a family
doesn't need a mother?


Mom?



What have you done?

Stay back.

It's me he'll punish.
I'm the one who didn't protect him.


Joseph, Brahms can't
hurt you anymore.

You don't understand.

It will never be over.

[notes playing]

[Joe screams]

all right, Brahms.

[door opens]

[chuckling]
Mom! You're home.

Yes. I missed you.

I missed you too.
Really?

Perfect timing.
Hey.

Hey, beautiful.
How was your day?

It was good.

I think we might sign that
author I was telling you about.

Yeah? Nice!

All righty.

This looks so good.
Thank you.

Wait until you taste it,
because I'm pretty confident

that this might be the greatest coq
au vin ever made upon English shores.

I'm not even joking.

There's a whole bottle of wine in
here, so I'm not sure if...

No, okay.
I will give you some.

Thank you.
All right.

This looks so good.

Thank you.

Just two or three hours
of my day. Nothing much.

[Sean chatters]

Is it my turn tomorrow?


Good night, my man.
You sleep tight.

I love you, sweetie.

Love you too.

Good night.


Good night, Brahms.

I think we'll be happy here.

If they learn the rules.
