You are smart.

You are talented.

Just do your best,
and stay calm.

â™ª My heart is racing â™ª

â™ª Can't stop this feeling â™ª

â™ª My ground is shaking â™ª

â™ª I... wanna let go, go crazy â™ª

â™ª Dance on the ceiling â™ª

â™ª My world is waiting â™ª

â™ª I... don't wanna
stop, give up â™ª

â™ª I want it all 'cause
I just ain't had enough â™ª

â™ª Keep up, we're gonna
show the world â™ª

â™ª That there's
just no stopping us â™ª

â™ª No one can
hold us back â™ª

â™ª We're gonna break the rules,
can't hold us back â™ª

â™ª We gotta light
the fuse in us â™ª

â™ª I'm livin on the wild side,
wild side â™ª

â™ª No telling what I might
find, might find â™ª

â™ª No stopping 'cause it feels
right, feels right â™ª

â™ª I'm livin on the... â™ª

Oh, my gosh!

Oh, my gosh. Sorry.
Hey!

Jenny. In a hurry?

Um... hey, Zac.

Uh, yeah.

You know, a big,
big interview.

Cool.

What are you doing
in my driveway?

The swim team is having
a car wash today,

so Dominique is helping me
hand out flyers.

So, uh, hey, come by
later if you get a chance.

I'll throw in
your tires for free.
Thank you.

Okay.
See ya.

( stammering )
Bye.

Oh, my gosh, Zac Chase
wants to polish my tires.

â™ª I used to think that
good things were so bad â™ª

â™ª No need to hold back
not me, no more â™ª

â™ª I'm walking this road â™ª

â™ª I'm taking control â™ª

â™ª My heart can't say no â™ª

â™ª I'm livin on the wild side,
wild side â™ª

â™ª No telling what I might
find, might find â™ª

â™ª No stopping 'cause it feels
right, feels right â™ª

â™ª I'm livin' on the... â™ª
( horn honks )

â™ª On the wild side,
wild side â™ª

â™ª So ready now,
it's my time, my time â™ª

â™ª No stopping 'cause it feels
right, feels right â™ª

â™ª I'm livin on the oooh,
oooh â™ª

â™ª Don't wanna live my life
by design â™ª

â™ª Locked inside,
break out â™ª

â™ª Break the rules,
light the fuse â™ª

â™ª Something new,
that's right â™ª

â™ª I'm livin' on
the wild side â™ª

Hey, what's up?

Of course I'm not late.

Okay. I'm not.

You are special,
you're an artist.

Everything you do
is art.

Why, everything you say,
everything you do

is just all art,
it's just brilliant.

You're brilliant.

Right. You're really good.

Oh, I don't wanna
talk about it.

Dude, chill.

Artists don't need college.

I will pay for
those parking tickets.

You're bringing me down.
I gotta go.

Bye, Mom.

Breathe.

Hi. I'm Lola Perez.

Could you let
Mr. Vasquez know I'm here?

Thanks, I'd appreciate it.

Uh, I don't work here.

I'm a finalist for
the photography internship.

Me, too.

Sh, sh, sh!

Quiet, please.
Voices down.

Mr. Vasquez is having
a creative moment.

Yes, brilliant!
Perfect-alus! Bravo!

Oh, it's so cool.
Weird.

Okay.
( clears throat )

Now, can I have
your portfolios?

Mr. Vasquez would like
to review them before
your final interviews.

Careful. Mine's
still wet.

Mine's perfectly dry.
Thanks.

Please have a seat.

This could take
ten seconds,

or ten hours.

Hey, didn't you go
to Highland Park?

Um, yes.

I still do.

Wait.

You were
that nerdy sophomore

in my senior
geometry class.

I'm not nerdy.
I'm dedicated.

I skipped
the eighth grade,

and now I'm on track
for early college admission.

Wow. That sounds
really fun.

But not.

( chuckles )
Well, I've already
got 12 credits,

two hundred hours
of community service,

maintain a 4.2 GPA,
and run my own business.

This art internship
will perfectly round out
my transcript.

Transcript?
That's why you're here?

Well, you know, that,
and my passion for photography.

Right, right.

Well, do you wanna know
what I did my last year
before college?

You were accepted
into college?

I could have been,
but I opted out.

You see, a real artist
is a student of life.

Anyway, an internship
with Leon Vasquez

would fast-track my career
as a professional photographer.

( ringtone plays
"Fur Elise" )

Professor Anderson,
is this about

my recommendation letter?

<i>No, I'm actually looking for</i>
<i>someone to babysit tonight,</i>

<i>because my niece</i>
<i>bailed on me.</i>

Okay, uh...
-<i>  Do you believe it?</i>

I'd love to babysit,
but unfortunately,

I'm already booked
with the Coopers tonight.

<i>Let me know if you can</i>
<i>think of anybody.</i>

Sure. Of course.
If I think of anyone.

-<i>  Thanks, Jenny.</i>
All right. Bye.

You're a babysitter?

What's that, like,
five bucks an hour?

Try 20. Double time
on holidays.

To watch kids
watch TV?

( laughs )
You've obviously
never babysat.

Yeah, 'cause I obviously
have a life.

Oh,<i>  magnifico!</i>
My exceptional finalists.

Oh, gosh!
Way to go, klutz.

A smoothie to
an interview?!

Stupendous
news, ladies.

I've decided interviews
will not be needed today.

Awesome.
Sorry, kid,
maybe next year.

You wish.

Since you both have
vastly different

artistic points
of view,

I feel a more unconventional
approach is warranted.

I want you to dazzle me!

Dazzle you?
Could you clarify,
dazzle, sir?

Take some new shots.

Be innovative.

I want to feel
your unique passions
for photography.

Oh, cool!

( speaking fluent Spanish )

( speaking halting
Spanish )

<i>Excelente.</i>

We'll reconvene Monday,
and I'll make my decision.

That gives you
all weekend.

May the best artist win.
BOTH: She will.

Bye-bye.
-<i>  Ciao. Gracias.</i>

<i>Adios.</i>

Well, this hardly seems
fair considering the time
constraints.

Oh, right. Have fun
babysitting.

No! Officer, wait!

Officer, hi.
I'm here.

Sorry, miss.
It's a loading zone.

But I was loading.

I was unloading
a super heavy portfolio

for this very prestigious
art internship.

I spoke to Mr. Vasquez.
Uh-huh.

( ringtone playing
"Fur Elise" )

Beethoven?

What?

"Fur Elise" is one
of my favorites.

( nervous chuckle )

That your boyfriend
calling?
What? No.

Boyfriend? What boyfriend?

No boyfriend
Totally single.
Sorry.

Hello, stranger
interrupting my day.
<i>- Hey, Jenny.</i>

It's Zac.

Look, I know it's
short notice,

but I just scored
great tickets

for the Psychic Rockets
concert tonight, and I was--

Awesome. I love that band.

But I hate concerts.

They're so juvenile.

Sorry, Zeke.
Not interested. Bye.

( sighs )

Whew! Stalkers.
What's a girl to do?

Wait, you're
still writing?

Uh, officer, I can't
get another ticket.

My parents said if I got
another parking ticket,

I would lose
my car keys.
Sorry. I'm a rookie.

Can't break the rules.

I'm sure a smart girl
like you can find a way

to pay her own tickets.

Have a nice day.

Thanks.

Eighty bucks?!

Where am I gonna get
80 bucks?

( "Fur Elise" plays )

Hello.

Jenny, hi, it's me again.

I'm desperate for
a babysitter.

My awards gala
is in two hours,

and I am
the guest of honor.

Are you sure you don't
know anybody who can babysit?

I'll pay double.

( cash register jingles )

Of course.

My good friend Lola
is very responsible.

I'll send her over.
<i>- Great.</i>

Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

Hey, Zac.

Dirty tires,
as requested.

Sorry. We're closed.

Come on, let's go.

TREY: Yes, of course.

My mom's going to
some party tonight.

Dude, I said I'm in.

Pick me up in 30 and don't
honk the horn this time.

Trey Anderson.
Mom! A little privacy.

Kids who spend over $200
on apps without permission

don't get privacy,

or phones,
or tablets.

You forgot to cut off
my air supply.

Oh, that can be arranged.

Look, we're leaving
for the gala soon,

so please, be nice
to the babysitter.

Wait, Jenny's coming?

No. Ugh. One of
Jenny's friends.

And you need
to shape up, Trey.

At this rate, you'll never be
responsible enough to babysit.

Promise?

Bobby Anderson, what
have you done to my kitchen?

It's called baking.

Mom!

Dad promised
to take me.

The Sirens
are playing the Belles.

I'm sorry, honey.
I got the dates mixed up.

It's not every day
your mother's research

is honored by
the National Science Foundation.

Dad will take you
to the next derby.

We promise.

Can you get our coats?
Yes.

Mom, you promised
to taste my frosting.

In a minute.
I guess everyone in
this family breaks promises.

Come on,
Roller Derby's lame.

You're lame!

Guys, don't start.

KATY: Hurry. Jenny will
be here any minute.

Ta-da!

Okay, bumblebee,
I can't decide

if I would rather lose feeling
in my toes or my heels.

I told you to go
with the strappy sandals.

Excuse me, young lady.
What are you wearing?

Lipstick.
No. Do not be cute.

Those earrings
are very expensive, sweetie.

They're one of a kind.

But Mommy, everyone knows
diamonds are a must

with evening casual.

Off. Now.

If my sister
can shave her head,

I should be able
to wear diamonds.

What?!

( buzzing )

( gasps )
Emily Cooper,
what are you doing?

You little tattletale!
You don't have the right
head shape for a buzz cut.

Why don't I give you
a buzz cut?

Okay, stop.
( huffs angrily )

Sweetheart, your hair
is beautiful just
the way it is.

I don't want you pulling
any of your pranks tonight,

and please be good
for Jenny.

( angry huff )

I'm too old
for a babysitter.

Me, too.

Katy Cooper, freeze.

I thought diamonds
were forever.

( rock music
ringtone plays )

Oh, no.

This is not happening.

Hello.
BOY:<i>  Lola, what's up?</i>

No, this isn't Lola.

I just...
I have her phone.

<i>Come to</i>
<i>a toga party tonight?</i>

No, I don't wanna come to
a toga party.

GUYS:<i>  Toga, toga, toga!</i>

( horn honks )
Ugh!

( doorbell ringing )

Hey, dude,
what's your name?

You're so cute.

Alison, was that...

Lola? Helen Anderson.
So nice to meet you.

Please come on in.

I see that you've
met Alison.

So sweet.
Yes.

So my niece
was supposed to sit,

but she flaked because of some
silly concert in the city.

So how long have you known
our Jenny?

Oh, um, since forever.

We share a love of
geometry and...

children.

Oh, how unique.
Yeah.

Lola, this is Bobby.
He has to finish 100 cupcakes

for his junior chef
competition tomorrow.

Taste my frosting.
Sure.

Oh, dig that color, dude.

It's the melted
gummy worms.

Oh, Bobby,
you didn't.

Mom, all the great chefs
improvise.

I'm never gonna win
with ordinary cupcakes.

It's not bad,
but you could
kick it up a notch.

I know. It needs
something.

I just have to find
the perfect ingredient.

Now Trey is upstairs
grounded.

Alison is sulking
because of the Roller Derby,

and this little
precious baby girl

is Lady Marmalade,
aren't you, my precious?

Yes, you are.

Now she has
a very big day tomorrow

at the Kennel Club,
so she needs
complete relaxation,

and no stress.
No stress for my baby.

Now very important.

The stove and the hot tub
are strictly off limits
when we're gone.

Make sure that Bobby
returns the kitchen

to its pre-cupcake
tidiness.

Tidiness? I'm creating.

And you would be
my personal hero

if you could just
toss in a couple
of loads of laundry.

Laundry.
Yes.

Okay, here's the invite
and my number.

Oh, hi.
I'm Hal Anderson.
Lola.

Nice to meet you.
Hi.

Oh, no, we are not taking my
brand-new freshly detailed SUV

into the dirty, grimy city.
We're taking the sedan.

You're the boss.
Thank you.

Okay, Lola,
here is my cell,

and the place
we're going to be tonight.

Now are you sure you can
handle three kids?

Oh, my gosh,
what am I saying?

Of course you can.
You were recommended by Jenny.

She taught me
everything I know.
Great.

Hi, Jen.
Come on in.

Oh, Mr. Cooper,
that's a nice tux.

Okay, honey.
Honey.

She did it again.

Katy, sweetheart,
what did I tell you

about glittering
your father?

He needed
a little bling.

Okay,
don't you worry.

We will clean that
right up.

You guys just go
and have a great time.

Thank you, Jenny.

Now would you please
say hello to Jenny?

Honestly.
Look it, I left money

so you guys can
go for ice cream.

Emily is banned from
doing anything to her hair.

Katy is banned from
my jewelry box.

Great.
Am I forgetting anything?

My three-star party
survival kit.

Mints, safety pins
and emergency cash.

Take care of our babies.
I'll guard them with my life.

We're going out.
I know.

Run! Just kidding.

Ooh, hot tub.

Hot tub out back?

Yep.
Cool.

Jailer Swift
on the attack!

Whoa!

Out of my kitchen!

Fire! Lola, help!

Fire, fire.
Help!

Hurry. Fire! Fire!

What?
Fire!

Put out the fire!
Uh, fire extinguisher?

( "Fur Elise"
ringtone plays )

BOBBY: This is bad!
LOLA: Get the fire
extinguisher.

Hello. Lola?

No, A.J.
-<i>  A.J. Anderson?</i>
<i>It's Jenny Parker.</i>

Why are you
answering my phone?

It's the babysitter's phone.

Babysitter?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

Your friend. I think
her name's Lola.

A.J. sweetie, could you please
put the babysitter on the phone?

She's busy.
<i>- Doing what?</i>

Putting out the fire.

The fire?!

A.J., don't panic.
I'll be right there, okay?

Kids, we're going
to the Andersons.

Trey Anderson?

Katy, let's go.

Katy, I mean now.

( alarm blaring )
BOBBY: Come on, hurry!

( alarm continues
blaring )

That was awesome.

Wait here, don't move.
I gotta get my camera
out of the car.

Camera?

( horn honks )

Hey, let me in,
you little punks.

Unlock the door!

Unlock the door!

What in the world
is going on here?!

Uh...

What is on fire?

Hey, girl, what's up?
Girl?

( stammering )
What are you doing?

Babysitting.
Obviously.

I can't believe this.

This is going to take
forever to clean up.

( Lola laughing )
Yeah, it will.

You kids better
get crackin'.

Us?
( shutter clicks )

Hey, where's Trey?

Who's Trey?

( knocking )

He's searching for
tickets online.

Psychic Rockets tickets
at Tiny's Pawn Shop?

He's going to
a concert?

That's awesome.

How could you let
a 14-year-old kid
sneak out into the city?

I'm sorry, how is this
my fault?

Babysitting rule
number one:

Never take your eyes
off the kids. Ever.

Okay, this is bad.

My name,
my reputation,

my entire
college future

is just down the drain.

Think, Jenny, think.

He has to get
the tickets, right?

I'll drive into the city
and bring him back myself.

I know the city.
I can get him.

You're the one
who lost him.

Relax, girlfriend, I'm
just trying to help.

I'm not your girlfriend.
I'm not your friend.
I don't even know you.

You don't?
My mom thinks you do.

Uh, I mean,
I was joking.

'Cause, like,
I do know her.

We're just not...
besties.

Why don't we all
go get Trey?

No. Your parents
would kill me.

They'll kill you when
they find out a total
stranger is watching us.

And who's gonna
tell them?

Anybody have to
go to the bathroom?

No, we can't.

Are you gonna fit
all of us in your car?

Okay, but...

BOTH: I'll drive.

I'll drive!
Thanks.

( bicycle bell rings )

Okay, we just got passed,

( horns honking )
by a bicycle.

I am not adding
a speeding ticket

and a stolen car
to this disaster.

( horns blaring )
BOBBY: Can we stop at
the grocery store?

No, I told you.
We're going to get Trey,

and then we're heading
straight home.

If anyone asks,
where did we go, people?

ALL: Ice cream.

You know, a professional
manicure could do
your hands wonders.

How old are you?
Seven.

You know what I was doing
with my hands when I was seven?

No, and she doesn't
want to.

At least pretend
to set an example.

Smile, Jenny.
This is no time
for pictures.

It is always
the time for pictures.
Art is spontaneous.

So say cheese!
No!

( barking )

( loud rumbling )

JENNY: Okay, guys,
we find this pawn shop,

get Trey, and get home
as fast as possible.

GPS VOICE:<i>  Turn left,</i>
<i>600 feet.</i>

<i>Turn left.</i>

Are you sure
this is right?

Well, yeah, that's what
the GPS says.

<i>Turn left</i>
<i>in 200 feet.</i>

Hey, puddle!
( screaming )

That was close.
If anything happens

to this car,
we're dead.

<i>Approaching destination</i>
<i>on left.</i>

There it is,
there it is.

Park here, park here.

Park here.
Okay!

Okay, you guys wait here.
I'll go.

Um, Jenny.
Oh, Katy.

Why didn't you go
before we left?

I didn't have to go
before we left, obviously.

It's okay.
I'll take her.

No. Babysitting rule
number two:

Leave no child behind.

Come on, kids,
let's go.

LOLA: Cool car.
JENNY: Yes, it's lovely.

Yeah, yeah,
we're all set.

Midnight. We bring the varmint,
you bring the 100 grand cash.

Yeah, yeah, 100 grand.

Look, this is
a sapphire ferret.

There's only three of them
in the whole entire world.

You want me to make it
200 grand?

All right then.
Midnight.

No funny business.
I gotta go.

What do you kids want?

This place is so cool.
It's so rustic.

Hey, no pictures.

Watch the camera, man.

Hi. We are looking for Tiny.

I'm Tiny.
Who wants to know?

My name is Jenny Parker.
I'm a babysitter,

and we are looking for
a teenage boy.

He came here earlier to buy
some concert tickets.

Oh, yeah.
You want the Scalper.

Make it quick.

Uh, you know what?
That's okay.

He looks busy.
We can wait.

No, we can't.
Let's go.

Thanks, dude.

Let go.

Stay ahead.
Stay ahead of me.

( clears throat )
( clears throat )

( animal chittering )

Hi there, Mr. Scalper sir.

Sorry to interrupt

your little martial arts
routine there,

but did you happen to sell
Psychic Rockets tickets

to a kid
earlier today?

Maybe I did.

Maybe I didn't.

Well, maybe if
we called the cops,

and told them there's
a weird scary dude

with a sword selling tickets
to minors,

would you remember him then?

Kid paid with ones.

I hate ones.

Hey, little guy.
Hungry?

Kid said something
about pizza.

I hate pizza.

Pizza? That's great.

That narrows it down
to about, I don't know,
4,000 restaurants.

Mario's. It's his favorite
pizza place.

I mean, if I was
gonna guess.

Guessing? Is that what
they call stalking
these days?

Jenny!

Bobby, what are you doing?

Bobby, calm down.
What is that, a weasel?

BOBBY: I don't know.

JENNY: Kids,
don't touch it.

Kids, stay back.

LOLA: Hey, man.
Hey, watch it.

What are you doing?!

Hey, the ferret's loose.

I got him. Okay.

Oh, I got him.

That's so cool.
Smile.

Hey, I said
no more pictures.

JENNY: Lola,
no means no.

TINY: Get the ferret.
Don't let the ferret get away.

The car's being towed.
Let's go!

Where'd it go?
( kids screaming )

JENNY: Hey, wait!

No, no, no.
Stop!

No, really, stop.

Okay, go.
Hi, sorry.

We did not see the sign.
This isn't even my car.

If you could just
please unhook it,

we're here now.
Sure, for 100 bucks.

100 bucks?
That's highway robbery.

We should have you towed.
( revs engine )

No, that's fine.
100 bucks.

Debit card is like
cash, right?
Yeah.

Oh, no. My purse.

I left it at
the Andersons.

If you could just please
give us the car now,

I promise you I will
give you the money tomorrow.

I don't do layaway, kid.

Okay, does anyone
have any money?

Why do you think
I'm babysitting?

I close at midnight.

But you can't just
leave us stranded here.

I mean, we're just kids.

Time to grow up.
LOLA: Seriously?

No, wait.
Don't go!

( kids screaming )

Hey, you better
wash that.

BOBBY: That's my mom's car!

Well, what now?

( sighs )

Great.

Anybody got
any bright ideas?

It's fine.
It's totally
under control.

We've just got no car,
no money,

no Trey, and we need
100 bucks by midnight.

It's doable.
It's totally doable.

Wait, what about
the ice cream money?

Yes, great thinking.

Um...

Ten bucks.
What's that gonna do?

I saw a bus stop
a few blocks over.

We take the bus
to Mario's,

get Trey,
and by then,

I'll figure out
what I'm gonna do next.

Okay. Whatever you say.

Let's go.

Jenny.
Yeah.

I'm scared.

Sweetie, there's...

nothing to be
scared of.

( sirens wailing )

How can you snack
right now?

I'm not snacking.
I'm taste testing.

Where did you get
the candy?

Uh, in the pawn shop.

Bobby, you took candy
from a stranger?
They were in a bowl.

I thought
they were free.
( frustrated sigh )

Hey!
I guess they
weren't free.

You kids are in
big trouble.

What do we do?
What do we do?
Run!

( horn honking )

Are they still chasing us?

( screaming )

We can't lose those kids.

They got a picture of me
with the sapphire ferret,

which would prove
that we stole it.

I'm not goin'
back to jail.

We can get 'em
at that pizza place.

JENNY: Hurry, guys.
Let's run.

KATY: These shoes
aren't made for running.

JENNY: Children,
everyone, on the bus.
Go, go, go, go.

Good evening,
kind sir.

Six kids.
That's 12 bucks.

Is it 12 now?
My, my, how times have changed.

Uh, let's just call it
close enough. Yeah?

Let's not.
Okay, well,

the thing is, uh... Karl,

we're having, like,
a minor situation tonight.

You see, thanks to Jenny,

the world's greatest
babysitter here,

we don't have
any additional actual money.

So...
Don't listen
to her, Karl.

This whole fiasco
is her fault.

I think we can all
stop pointing fingers
and worry about Trey.

Don't pretend to care
about Trey.

Honestly, Karl, she
doesn't care about
anybody but herself.

I care about
a lot of things, Karl,

like art and expression
and photography.
PASSENGER: Let's go.

I bet she didn't even
know who Leon Vasquez
was until today.

I did too.
I read all about him.

Please, I saw your portfolio.
It's as stiff as you are.

Where'd you learn to
take pictures, sweetheart,
your computer?

Where'd you learn
all this snappy sarcasm?
We know it wasn't college.

Enough! Get on
and zip it!

If you could just
send me the address,

I'd be happy to
send you the balance.
Sit!

Hey, guys.

A.J.? What are
you doing here?

Trey Anderson, freeze.

Who's that?
His babysitter.

You have a babysitter?
I want a babysitter.

She's hot.

You are so lucky
we found you.

Hey, Jenny.
You look great.

Hi, Trey.

Please don't
rat me out, Jenny.

I'll be grounded
for life.

Probably till
you're 18.

Who are you?
Lola.

Technically,
I'm your babysitter,

so thanks for making me
look bad, by the way.

You didn't need help for that.
Come on, Trey, let's go.

What about the concert?
There's no way you're
going to that concert.

Besides, we have
much bigger problems
to deal with right now.

Jenny got Mom's
new car towed.

You drove my mom's
car into the city?
To get you,

and now we need $100
to get it back by midnight.

I don't suppose you
losers have any money.
I spent it all on tickets.

That's it. Why don't we just
scalp Trey's concert ticket

to get the cash
for the car?

You mean,
sell it ourselves?

Exactly. Brilliant.

Wait. It's mine.
Oh, cool.

So you wouldn't mind
explaining to your mother

that her car got towed
and her precious children

spent the night
sitting on a cold
park bench in the city.

I have a better idea.

Why don't we just
call her now, shall we?

Oh, Helen.
( sighs )

This is so not fair.

Life isn't fair, kid.

Jenny, I really have to
go to the bathroom.

Okay.

Everyone, stay put.

Hey, Bobby,
check this out.

Oh, that's so cool.

Bummer about the concert.

Dude, forget the concert.
Go for Jenny.

She was totally
checking you out, too.

She was?
Yeah.

I'm going to
the tattoo place.

Cool. Have fun.
Go express yourself.

Thanks for the zip.
Not even a problem.

Lucky you had
a safety pin.

I know. Right?

So did you hear
who Zac Chase

is taking to
the concert tonight?

No. Who?
Guess.

Who?
Guess.

Who?
Dominique Cassidy.

No!

Jenny Parker.
Is that really you?

Hey, girls.

Whoa! I never would've
thought to see you

in the city
on a Friday night.

Really? Why not?
It's the weekend, right?

I live for fun.
Right.

So who are you
here with?

Just some friends.

They're city friends.

They're really
mature friends.

You probably
wouldn't know them.

Help. I'm all twisted.

Oh, poor little girl.

Where's your mommy?

I'll go help you
find her.

I have to wash my hands.
You can use sanitizer.

Where'd everybody go?

Bobby?

A.J.?

Smile.
Lola.

Where are the kids?
Uh, specifically,
I don't know. Around.

Around? Are you
out of your mind?
Possibly.

Babysitting rule
number one: Never take
your eyes off the kids.

Trey, A.J., Bobby.

Uh, where's Emily?

Uh, she's getting
a tattoo.

Getting a what?!

A tattoo.

TINY: In and out
like stealth ninjas.

Emily, are you okay?

Please, please tell me
you did not just
get a tattoo.

What? It's henna.

The guy did it for free
'cause he liked my aura.

Cool, right?
Super cool.

So not super cool.
How could you do that
without asking me?

I asked Lola.
She did.

Lola... Lola
is nobody, okay?

You can't just
wander off like that.

Something could've
happened to you.

You are my responsibility,
okay?

And that better come off
with soap and water.

Uh, Jenny.
What, Bobby?

Please don't let
them get me.
Go, go, go, go!

Go, go, go, go!

BOBBY: Go! Come on!

TREY: Why are the pawn shop
guys after us?

KATY: Bobby stole
a candy bar.

So give it back.
I can't, I licked it.

Come this way.
Bobby!

There.

Go this way.

Sh, sh, sh!

( door creaks open,
slams shut )

They went this way.

You don't know
what way they went.

Sh, sh!

( alarm blares )

We know you're
in here.

Just wanna have
a reasonable conversation.

SCALPER: Yeah, we're
very reasonable people.

TINY: We locked the doors.

There's no way out.

JENNY: Get down. Lola.
No way out!

We're not leaving
till we get that camera.

My camera?

These guys are crazy.

We need to find
another way out.

Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

That's them.
Come on!

KATY: Go away!
Leave us alone!

Get down!
Stop the belt.

BOBBY: Pick on someone
your own size.

You're makin' me jump.

You're not gettin'
my camera.

Give me the camera.

( blows raspberry )
Nice going!

Hey, kids.

( laughing )
JENNY: Careful.

TREY: With your legs,
with your legs.

Let's go.

TREY: This is so cool. Whoo!

KATY: Come on, guys,
let's hurry.

Okay, let's go.
Come on.

Come on.

Let's go.

BOBBY: Hey, look out!

Go! Go, go, go.

Go, go. Right.

We can't get around this, guys.
There's no way out.

Yeah, there is.

There's an awesome
way out.

Oh, yeah!

No, no, no.
Yeah.

HELEN: What an incredible
party.

I can't believe
this is all for me.

Well, you deserve
it all.

There's Barry and Donna.
Let's say hello.

I should give
the kids a call though.

Oh, honey,
they're fine.

I don't know.
A.J. was so upset

about missing
the Roller Derby match.

She must be miserable
and bored.

Are you ready?
You bet.

How did you learn
how to do that?

How do you think
I got off the roof?

This outfit is so going
to need dry cleaning.

Your parents are never
going to ask me to
babysit again.

If they do, I'd ask
for ten bucks more an hour.

Ready?
Okay.

Jenny!

Right there.

TINY: Who turned out
the lights?
Here I come.

Is everyone okay?
( all saying yes )

Let's go sell
that ticket.

TINY: You're on my leg.
My leg, my leg.

I'm having trouble
breathing.

What just happened?

I hate kids.

We could still get 'em
at that concert.

Yeah.

LOLA: Okay, I'm gonna do it.

Are you sure this
is a good idea?

Yeah, people sell
concert tickets every day.
It's no big deal.

Here, kid.
Guard this with your
life, okay?

You can trust me.
I'm a Derby girl.

Okay.
Hurry up.

We'll just be over
here by the taco cart.

Oh, tacos.

Maybe my cupcakes
could use some heat.

Jenny, sit on this.

Thanks, Trey.
So thoughtful.

Hundred bucks?

Hey, tickets.
Just 100 bucks.

How about you, beautiful?
a ticket, 100 bucks?

What are you doing, A.J.?
Please be careful.

It's the Swift trip chop.

A right chop
with a back spin.

It's Jailer Swift's
signature move.

Like that would
ever work.

Ticket, ticket.
Hundred bucks. Ticket.

Concert ticket,
hundred bucks.
There she is.

Hey, hey.
Hundred bucks, concert ticket.

No, how about you?

Hundred bucks?
You got one already.

Reselling a ticket
at the site of a venue
is illegal.

Did I say sell?
I meant donate.

I was gonna donate
this ticket to a very
deserving person, officer.

Oh, no, no,
not the police.

Sounds like you're
trying to bribe me.
No, no, no.

Oh, no!

Stupid kid.
Nabbed by the cops.

I see that.

Come on.
Oh, but, sir, I didn't
do it, I swear.

She'd want
a picture of this.

Excuse me, ma'am.

We're looking for
our friend Lola.

She's 19, dark hair,
snappy attitude.

Yeah, she's getting booked.

Booked?

Is that, like, arrested?
Like yep.

Have a seat, and we'll
call you when we're
done processing her.

Uh, fat man called Tiny
and a tall, skinny guy

with a hat.
Hood.

And a weird little
furry animal thing.

Maybe a ferret.
I don't know.

( sighs )

You are aware that lying
to an officer of the law

is also a crime.

You are aware
I'm not lying, officer.

It's gonna be
a long night, kid.

I'm never gonna find
the perfect ingredient

in time for
the contest.

Quit your whining.
I'm missing the biggest
rivalry in Roller Derby history.

Both of you
quit your whining.

I'm missing the biggest
concert of the year.

Hey, everyone quit whining.
Just sit and be quiet
so I can think.

You're smart,
you are calm,

you always have the answers.

Hey, Jenny.
Can't we just call

one of your friends
for help?

My friends are busy
studying.

What about
your parents?

I told you,
they're out of town.

Emily, what did you do?

Nothing. It's just
a little hair dye.

Just a little
bit of hair dye?

Just a little tattoo.
What is wrong with you?

Why are you being
so irresponsible?

I'm not irresponsible.

You're just making
everything worse.

Now go sit with
the other kids

so I can figure
out what to do.

Okay, you wanted to
teach me a lesson,

and I get it.
I'm sorry.

Can I go now?

I'm not entirely convinced
you do get it, young lady.

You have more than a few
violations on your record.

Parking tickets,
not bank robberies.

This girl giving you
trouble, officer?

Next time, keep the fighting
in the rink

and not
the parking lot.

They started it.
Yeah, and we're
gonna finish it.

Enough already.
You three, over there.

The other three, there.

All right.
Thank you.

It's Jailer Swift.

It's you.

You're my hero.
Yeah?

I've been trying
to learn the Swift
trip chop for six months.

Let's see what you got.

Not bad, kid, not bad.

But you need some more torque
on that back spin.

Like so.

( man snoring )

( snoring loudly )

Congratulations, Helen.

Hey. How are you?
Hi.

I'm so proud of her.
I know.

( phone buzzing )

Mom, help.

Jenny stole the Andersons'
new car,

and got us all arrested.

We're downtown
in the city... ( yells )

You were right.

Except for the parking
tickets, you're clean.

See, I told you.
I'm not a felon.

I'm just an innocent
babysitter.

And what kind of example
do you think you're setting
for those kids up there?

You think it's
one big joke?
No.

Trying to sell concert tickets
may not be a felony,
but it's dangerous.

Some thug could've
snatched those tickets
and your wallet.

Then what?

I don't know. I guess
I didn't really think of that.

No, you didn't.

Look, you're
a smart girl.

But you need to start
thinking about your actions.

Those kids up there,
they look up to you.

They wanna be you.

They don't even
know me.

I'm not even
their real babysitter.

I lied to get the job,

and I lied to you
earlier.

Officer, I'm not
a Furry Lisa-loving
college student.

I never even heard of
Furry Lisa before today.

"Fur Elise."
Beethoven.

Right.
Doesn't matter.

The truth is,
I wanted to go to art school,

but my grades
weren't good enough to get in,

so I didn't even try.

And now I'm up for this amazing
photography internship

with my idol, and...

if I get it, then
I'll have another chance
to make things right.

I really am an artist,

and I really am
a good photographer.

And I'm really sorry
I lied to you,

but you're kinda sorta
super cute,

and I know I always
make mistakes,

and I know this
was a big mistake,

but I just...

I don't think
I belong in jail.

Neither do I.

You don't?

No.

Oh, thank you. Sorry.

So do you need any help
getting those kids home?

Can I call
their parents--
No!

No, we're good.
But thank you.
Okay.

Let's see if
your friends
are up here.

Oh, there they are.
Lola!

You're okay!

Hi, Katy.
Hi, cutie.

Lola!
Hi. You guys came.

Say cheese.

Stop pushing.
You're blocking my face!

I'll block your face
with my foot.

Come on now.

You guys, get out
of here now. Go, go!

TINY: We gotta
get that camera.

SCALPER: We'll get it.
No matter what.

Look at that. That little one,
she's got the camera.

Get her.
Go, go, go.

JENNY: Come on, guys.

Lola, are you okay?
Was it scary?
Did they hurt you?

No, I'm totally fine.

Fine? You just
got arrested.

It's fine, Jenny.
Relax. It's not a big deal.

This has gone way beyond
sneaking out to a concert.

You guys, I'm sorry,
but we have to call
your parents.

ALL: No!
You're just gonna
give up, just like that?

It's called
being responsible.
You should try it sometime.

And you should try
loosening up.

Be in the moment.

Hey, little girl.
Come here.

Give me that camera.
You wish!

It worked!

Hey, hey!

Guys!

( Lola and Jenny
continue arguing )
Get her!

Uh, hey, you guys.

BOTH: What, Bobby?
Uh, A.J.

Oh, no, A.J.

Help, police!
Help!

A.J.

That's their car.

Keys.
Let's take their car.

No, no,
that's stealing.

It's not stealing,
it's borrowing.

Babysitting rule
number two:

Leave no child behind.
Or ahead, right? Yeah.

I can't believe that
you dragged me out of a party

for one of
Emily's pranks.

Police don't
arrest children.

You heard the message.
She sounded terrified.

Taxi!

I'm sure they're
just at home,

absolutely fine,
in front of the TV,

watching some
ridiculous car chase.

( tires screeching )

Hang on, A.J.
We'll save you.

Kids, this is not
how a responsible
babysitter behaves.

A.J.: Excuse me. Sorry.

Hey, lady, look out.

SCALPER:
Out of the way!

LOLA: There he is.
KATY: There's the big guy.

Get away from my sister.
Yeah!

( panting )

Hey, hey.
That's my car!

KATY: Faster, Lola,
faster!

Look! There she is.

We can do this.
Come on.

LOLA: That was close.

Hey! That's our car!

Stupid ferret.

You can do it, Tiny.

Think of the money.
Think of the money.

Professor Helen Anderson.

And thank you so...
( cell phone rings )

Oh.

( ringing continues )
Okay. Oops.

( line ringing )

( whispering )
My phone called
the Andersons.

Hands free,
hands free.

Uh, sorry.
Babysitter.

( laughter )

Hello. Hello?

( both sputtering )

Helen.
ALL: Helen?

Lola, is everything okay?

Oh, totes.
Just checking in.

You're checking in
with me?

I've never heard
of that before.

Uh, babysitter bonus.

It's part of
the premium package.

Uh, okay, have fun. Bye.

Bye. Thank you.

Everything is fine.

<i>Everything</i>  is fine.

And I'm fine.

Actually, I am...
I am more than fine.

Are you gonna
explain to Helen

why her best friends
missed her speech?

Whoa! Did you see that?

What kind of parent
lets their kid roller skate
in the city after dark?

DONNA: That's unbelievable.
The things you
see in this city.

There she is right there.

A.J.: Look out!

JENNY: Oh, my gosh, she's
headed for the picnic tables.

A.J.!
( all yelling )

Pick up your food.
Coming through.

Sorry!

ALL: Yes!
Nice, A.J.

Ooh!
That's gotta hurt.

JENNY: There she is,
there she is.

A.J., are you okay?

A.J., please tell me
you're okay.

Everything's good.
No scratches. Awesome.

Move, move!

You okay?

Okay, guys,
not okay.

Not okay.
Not good.

LOLA: Down here.
Let's go!

In here.

Front door.
I know a guy.

â™ª Now put your hands up,
now wave them side to side â™ª

â™ª I got all my people with me
and we ready to ride â™ª

â™ª 'Bout to blow the roof
by the end of the night â™ª

â™ª Lighting up the sky
like it's 4th of July â™ª

â™ª Yeah, you gotta light... â™ª

JENNY: Hurry before
they catch up.
LOLA: Is my camera okay?

Really? You're worried
about your stupid camera?

It's not stupid.

I won this camera in
my first photography contest.

This camera is proof
I have talent.

Whatever. Come on.
Let's just go before
they come back, all right?

( music slows down,
stops )

Whoa!

Yo!

Sorry. Wrong place.
Bye.

Oh, no, no, no.
Stop in your tracks.

'Cause you ain't
goin' nowhere

till we get the facts.

Excuse me?
You heard me.

Step on my stage,
you gotta spill your rage.

My rage?
No, we're fine.

There's nothing
to rage about.
Come on, kids.

Uh-uh-uh.

Y'all know how we do.
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

It's double true.
What?

'Cause if it's
your first time..

AUDIENCE: You gotta rhyme!

What?
Rap, Jenny.

They want you to rap.
I can't rap.
I'm a babysitter.

Just say something.
Anything.

LOLA: Just go.
Be creative.

Huh.

Hello.

My name is Jenny Parker.

( scratches )

And these kids are my...

Crew?

( hip-hop beat playing )

We're in a lot of trouble...

and I'm not sure what to do.

( feedback whines )

See, it all started
when our phones made a switch.

Lola lied to the parents.

She's been a real witch.

AUDIENCE: Ooh!

Kid snuck out,
the kitchen caught fire.

The car got towed,
all because she's a liar.

â™ª â™ª

Now these bad guys
are chasing us.

We almost just died.

I got a tattoo.

Can you let
that one slide?

( feedback whines )

This girl is ruining
my life.

My job, my reputation.

And if we ever get home,
I'm gonna need a vacation.

AUDIENCE:
Yeah, tell it, girl!

But no matter what,
I won't be a quitter.

Gonna care for these kids,
'cause I'm the ba...by...sitter.

AUDIENCE: She ain't no quitter.
She's the babysitter.

She ain't no quitter.
AUDIENCE: She ain't
no quitter.

EMILY: Go out there, Lola,
show 'em what you got.

Yeah? She's really
good though.

You can do way better
than her.

You think so?
Yeah.

Come on.

AUDIENCE:
She's the babysitter.

She's the babysitter...

Hold up just a minute,
that's not the straight scoop.

This girl's so uptight,
she's tied in a loop.

( laughing )
We got ourselves
a battle of the babysitters.

Let's rewind this movie
an hour or two.

The kid snuck out,
I didn't have a clue.

Yeah, that's true.

Okay, I admit it,
I don't follow rules.

I'm not good with kids,
I'm not good at school.

It wasn't my plan
to steal a car,

or end up in jail
or take it this far.

It's true I lied,
but nobody's died.

And these kids are having
an incredible ride.

You think you know it all,
but you don't know me.

See, I'm more than just
Miss Spelling Bee.

You want to be
a real artist,

take pictures, get gritty,

on your first night out
in the big, bad city.

You're a cool girl, Jenny,
but I'm pretty cool, too.
Go, Lola, go, Lola.

In fact, I'm just as great
a babysitter as you.

Ha!

She's right, I'm smart,
and I do follow rules.

I work real hard,
and I care about school.

There's a time for fun,
to let go and climb trees,

but I am a real artist;
everybody say cheese.

ALL: Cheese!

We ain't no quitters.

We're the babysitters.

They ain't no quitters.

They're the babysitters.
They're the babysitters.

They ain't no quitters.

They're the babysitters.

They ain't no quitters.

They're the babysitters.
They're the babysitters.

We ain't no quitters.

We're the babysitters.

That's right.

They ain't no quitters.

They're the babysitters,
they're the babysitters.

They ain't no quitters.

There they are.
Come on.

JENNY: Lola, they're here.
Look.

Peace out!
Let's go, guys.

KATY: Well, good night.
Come on, kids.

TINY: Move! Come on.

SCALPER: Out of the way.

Those are our kids.
Can we just...

Stop in your tracks.

'Cause you ain't goin' nowhere
till we get the facts!

Facts?

Jenny, you were great!

That was amazing.
I can't believe
I just did that.

See what happens
when you just let go?

The art just
starts to flow.

Well, speaking of flow,

we better get going before
these guys come out, all right?

Jenny, you were
way cool.

TREY: Not cool.
You were radical!

She didn't end
world hunger, people.

Yeah, I just
came on shift,

but let me check, okay?

Yeah, all right.

George, got any kids
locked up in the back,
or babysitters?

None yet.

We don't usually
lock up the children

until after midnight.
( both laughing )

I'm sorry.

This was mama's
one night out.

Thanks, fellas.

LOLA: That was really great.
I am so proud of you.
JENNY: Thanks.

Hey, you should
talk to Emily.
She seems pretty down.

Hey, um, I just wanted
to apologize about earlier

back at the police station.

Whatever.

Just forget it.

No, I won't forget it.

It's been an awful night,

but it's no excuse
to hurt your feelings.

You're not a child.

You're an amazing,
smart, cool girl.

No, I'm just a dork.

Nobody even knows
I exist.

I'm just
an invisible dork.

You're not invisible.
You're beautiful.

And you don't need
green hair or tattoos
to be noticed.

Just be your
awesome self.

I promise you,
it's enough.

If he doesn't
see that, then...

that's his loss.

Besides...

boys are dorks.

They are dorks.

Thanks, Jenny.

Um, Jenny.

I have something I should
probably tell you.

Maybe she meant
the North Park station.

It's not that far--
No, no, no.

Absolutely not.

Barry, I am tired,
I'm cold.

My feet are numb.

Barry, why didn't
you tell me

that I was wearing
two different shoes?

I thought it was
a fashion choice.

You called
your parents?!

I'm sorry.
She called the parents.

That's it, it's over.

BARRY: Taxi.

That girl looks
like Emily.

She's got green hair.
You're exhausted.

Emily, you have to
call them back and
tell them it was a prank.

Here, use mine.

Come on.
( line ringing )

We'd have gotten back
faster if we walked.

Of course, we can't walk
because of my shoes.

Finally.
Maybe it's Jenny.

( phone buzzing )

L. Perez.
I don't know any L. Perez.

I'm not answering.
Stop.

<i>Hi, you've reached...</i>

Didn't answer.
Great. There goes that plan.

Can't you just
delete the message?

How? I don't
know the code.

Mom and Dad are at
the planetarium.

It's not that
far from here.

Yeah, let's just
sneak into the party,

find your mom's phone and delete
the message ourselves.

Ooh, sure, no problem,
MacGyver.

I'll just take out
the security guards

with my Taser gun,
and then,

Katy here can shimmy in
through the air ducts.

I'm not dressed
to shimmy.

Are you always
this negative?

You can't even consider
an idea that's a little
bit outside the box?

Outside of the box?
You just got outside of jail.

Now you wanna
crash a gala?

Even if we could make it,
there's no chance

we'd get
the money in time.

Katy's three-star
party survival kit.

Mommy keeps
a hundred-dollar bill

in her fancy coat pocket.
Yes, Katy!

No, it's too dangerous.

Come on, Jenny.

There are moments in life
where you just have to
take a risk

and go for it.

This is one of
those moments.

What brings
you kids here?

We're going to steal
money from my mommy's...

Kids. They are so cute.

We're babysitters just taking
a little evening field trip

to the planetarium.

Field trip?
At this hour?

Dude, Jupiter's
at opposition.

Best time to observe it.

You're right.
You really know your stuff.

My mom's
a scientist.

Go, go.

Finally.

My people.

Lucky I wore diamonds.

No, Katy, you didn't.

Really?

It's Friday night.
What did you expect
me to wear, pearls?

Hey, it's Mom.
Where?

Oh, no, this is
a nightmare.

No, it's actually
a really good picture.
It's intense.

Not the picture.

If she sees me, I'll never
get that recommendation letter.

How did you forget
the Andersons were
gonna be here tonight?

I didn't forget.
I have it right
here on this note.

Where's the note?

National Science Foundation
Celestial Ball.

This must be
our lucky night.

It sure is.

Ah, do you smell that?

Fresh oregano
and a hint of red pepper.

Jenny, coat room's
over there.

Everyone duck and cover.
Let's go.

Go!

And these are
my people.

Oh! I can't serve this.

It's original
creation.

<i>C'est magnifique.</i>

It's dog poop.

You are dog poop.

I quit!

( speaking French )

What's taking so long?
The guests are waiting
for dessert.

( stammering )

Okay, I'll distract
the coat check person,
Jenny, you find the coat.

Great, good. Okay.

Uh, everyone,
stay in here.

Trey, Emily,
keep an eye on the... kids.

Where's Bobby?

I need sea salt
and Mexican chocolate.

Freshly grated,
of course.

Who are you?

Assistant pastry chef,
dude... sir.

Hurry. Go!

Sea salt!

Oh, my gosh,
what's he doing?

It's fine; let the kid
do his thing.

We gotta buy some time.

I wanna go
to the party, too.
Absolutely not, Katy.

Do you remember what my mommy's
fancy coat looks like?

You're good.
Let's go.

Sea salt!

Thank you.

I can't believe you thought
our kids were in the city jail.

Let's just get our coats
and go home.

It's Mommy.
Katy.

It's your kids, too.

It's Jenny.

Where?

No, she's not
here, Barry.

I mean, Jenny is
babysitting.

She's the most responsible
babysitter in the world.

If anything was wrong,
she would've called us.

Jenny.
There it is.

Oh, no!
She's coming!

BARRY: I still
wanna go home.

Fine. Go home.

I'm going
to get dessert.

You do that.

I have to eat
dessert now.

Great. There goes
our cash.

Why don't we just
go get it?

Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the Coopers
will recognize me.

But...

But what?

Uh, I never wear heels.

It's easy, you just
stand on your toes.

Okay.

How do I look?

Almost. Not quite.
Come here.

Okay.

Here we go.

No, no, there's no way
I'm doing this.

This is never gonna--
Come on, Lola.

There are moments in life
when you just have to take
a risk and go for it.

This is one of
those moments.

No.

Absolutely not.

Even worse.

What is this?
Celery leaf.

I don't ever wanna
see this again.

Will somebody bring me
something innovative?

Innovative!

That's it!

Crushed seaweed.
It's so innovative.

I hear he's from
the Culinary Institute.
Some sort of prodigy.

It's all about
the perfect ingredient.

It sure is, kid.

Can I help you,
gentlemen?

Yeah, you see some kids
come in here?

Who wants to know?

Uh...

We're their uncles.

Their parents sent us
to pick them up.

I think you better
wait here.

Hey!

Yeah, this is Eugene
in the lobby.

I got two suspicious subjects
heading into Sky Pavilion.

I may need back-up.

( British accent )
Hello, darling. Lovely party.

Where is she?

Look at all the dresses.

( British accent )
Hello, all.
Fabulous gala.

Oh, what about
that piano player?

Wasn't that "Fur Elise"
he was playing earlier?

I don't know.

All I know is
this mousse is incredible.

Oh, there's Lola.

Tastes good.

Let me see.

KATY: She looks so pretty.
JENNY: Thanks to you.

Oh, I love your earrings.

My husband gave me a pair
just like that.

He told me they were
one of a kind.

That's what
I was told.

These were a gift
from my boyfriend.

He's a police officer,
a rookie.

So handsome.

How nice.

Oh, I adore your coat.

Is this real wool?

No, it's cashmere.
That's what you told me.

Clumsy me.
I'll get it.

That's what it says
on the tag.

Okay, fine, so they're not
one of a kind.

You don't have to
lie about it.
I didn't.

I swear, honey.

You know what, it's fine,
I don't care.

Let's just have fun.
I wanna enjoy what's
left of the evening.

This dessert,
it's a lot of fun.

Well, if you'll
excuse me.

Nature calls.
Toodles.

Give me the camera.
This is not mine.

You brought the ferret!

I ain't leavin'
100 grand in the car.

We gotta stop him
before he gets away.

Oh, sorry.
Nice party.

( people screaming )

TINY: Come here, buddy.
Come on.

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Oh, come here.

You little ferret,
come here.

Come here.
Come to Tiny.

Come to Tiny.

( notes playing
discordantly )

Oh, my God!

There he goes. Yay!
He's on my foot.

He's on my foot,
he's on my foot.

He's on my foot.

I hope we're not
missing anything.

What?

Nothing.
Crouton?

So... why did you want
to do that to your hair?

I don't know.

Because.

I'm... boring.

You're not boring.

Yes, I am.

No, you're not.

Tell you the truth,
I think you're pretty cool.

You do?

Yeah.

Your music's
what's boring.

It is not.
Yeah, it is.

Yours is boring.

Come on, guys.
Time to go.

Time to go.
We got the money.
Come on.

A.J., let's go,
come on.

I'm gonna get you
when we get out.

If you could drive
more than five
miles an hour...

You just had to let
the ferret get away.

Hey, isn't that...
( arguing continues )

It's a long story.
No time. Come on.

Uh-huh. A big, fat man
named Tiny,

a tall, skinny guy
in a hood,

and a rare
sapphire ferret.

MAN:<i>  Yeah, can you</i>
<i>believe that?</i>

Yeah, actually,
I do believe you.

( kids laughing )

LOLA: We did it!
I can't believe it.

And with an extra 20 bucks
to get to the tow yard.

How did you get
an extra 20?

Smart babysitters
check both pockets.

Nice going.
You know, we actually
make a pretty good team.

We do, don't we?
Wait.

You know, I really
underestimated you, Jen.

Underneath all this
stifled perfection,

there's a really
cool chick.
Thanks, Lola.

Yeah, I can totally see
why that guy asked you
to the concert.

It makes so much
sense now.

What... guy?

Uh, uh, I think
his name was Zeke.

Zac.
Yeah, uh...
Sounds about right.

Zac Chase invited me
to a concert?

How could you
not tell me?

I forgot.
You forgot.

That was only the single
most important phone call

of my life.
What did you say?

Uh, not much.

Uh, I might've implied
that you possibly

weren't interested in him.

What?

Why would you
do that?

I was distracted.

You saw how cute
Officer James is.

I'm sorry, Jenny,
I didn't mean to...

That's great.
That's great because

now he's there with
Dominique Cassidy.

That should've been me
at that concert.

Maybe it's not
too late.

Of course it's too late.

That show is almost over,
and now, we have to get the car

and get back home.

Just forget it.

No, I won't.
Taxi!

Taxi!
What are you doing?

The right thing.
You guys, come on, let's go.

Come on, there's still
time if we hurry.

You don't have to worry about
those guys anymore, buddy.

I'm gonna get you home.
( chittering )

You guys won't be kidnapping
any more exotic animals
where you're going.

Hey, Hal, I have
a message from
the security company.

They said the alarm
went off at the house earlier,

and the babysitter's
not answering.
Try the home phone.

( phone ringing )

( ringing continues )

Wait, wait.

We don't even
have tickets.

Just let me
handle this, okay?

Just for once,
trust me.

Hi.
Ticket.

No, but what's it
gonna take to get
all of us in?

You know you can't
take your camera in, right?

Give it to me,
and I'll let you all in.

Right. Right, yeah.

Of course. Yeah.

I'll just take
the memory card.

No, no. Stop.

You can't do that.
That means too much
to you, Lola.

Yes, I can.

Let's go, guys.

Okay, go get
your guy, Jen.

Uh, guys, I can't
go in like this.

I'm a mess.

I'm on it. Okay.

Come on.

Emily, Trey, watch the kids.
Nobody move.

You bet.
Got it.

Trust me. I know
what to do.

( muffled rock music
plays )

What do we do?
Jacket.

Sweater.
Sweater. Hands up.

Sweater.

Tie your shirt.
Tie the shirt.

What else,
mastermind?

â™ª â™ª

Gorgeous.

Ta-da!

You look great!

What do you guys
think?

( all exclaiming )

Nice job.
Yeah, really.

You look amazing.

Have fun.

I don't think
I can do this.

Yes, you can.

Just look at everything
you did tonight.

You risked your life,
you went to jail,

you stole a car,
rapped onstage,

you crashed a gala
and fought off criminals.

Talking to a boy
will be easy.

Yeah.

Yeah, I guess
you're right.

Thanks, Lola.

Of course.
Now go get him.

MUSICIAN: Thank you.
Good night!

It's over.
What do I do?

Go. Go get him, Jenny!

Go! Just go find him.

Go. He's in there
somewhere.

Zac.

Zac!

Zac!

Zac Chase?

Zac!

Jenny?

What are you
doing here?
Looking for you.

Me? But you told me
to get lost.

No, it wasn't me.
Someone else had my phone.

I would've said yes.

You would?

Wait, don't move!

Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry, sorry.

Hold on, Jen.

Hi.

Hi.

You look beautiful.

Thank you.

Thanks.

I really have to go.

But you just got here.

I know. It's a long story...

and a long night.

I just wanted you
to know the truth.

And I really
have to go now.

Then I'll come with you.

But what about Dominique?

Dominique? No, she
left early with her boyfriend.

She has a boyfriend?

KIDS: Jenny. Jenny!

Jenny.
Jenny!

Jenny, I got a missed call
from the Andersons,

but I thought we should
listen to the message together.

All right. Put it
on speaker.

Hi, guys.
This is Zac.

Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I'm sort of babysitting.

Wow. Their parents must
really trust you

to take their kids
into the city.

Okay, guys,
here it is.

<i>Lola, the security company</i>
<i>called.</i>

<i>The alarm went off earlier,</i>

<i>no one's answering</i>
<i>at the house,</i>

<i>and we just heard from</i>
<i>the Coopers</i>

<i>who are looking for</i>
<i>their kids in the city jail.</i>

<i>- We're on our way home.</i>
I knew it.

I knew this would happen.
I knew we would've
been home by now

if I hadn't broken
the most important
rule of all.

You never put a boy
before kids.

No, it's my fault.
I talked you into it.

I practically forced you.

I never should've
taken this job.

I thought babysitting
was the easiest job
in the world,

but it's not.

Jenny, I'll take
full responsibility.

I'll tell the truth.

You didn't recommend me,
we're not friends.

I lied about everything.

Let's just turn
ourselves in.

For once, I agree with you.

Now just wait
one minute.
Yeah.

We've spent the whole night
listening to you two
argue and whine.

But you two aren't
the only ones with
something to lose.

We're not?
Hello!

I snuck out
to a concert.

I skated off
in the city by myself.

I used the stove.
Started a fire.

Impersonated a chef.

I took my mommy's
favorite diamond earrings.

I dyed my hair green,
got a tattoo,

and told my parents
we were in jail.

I'm sorry, guys.
Yeah, me, too.

There's no way
we'll make it.

Not if we don't try.

BOTH: We ain't no quitters.

Uh, we're the babysitters.

All right, Zac,
how big is your car?
Let's go.

How long do you think
it'll take to get
to the tow yard?

Wait! Wait, stop!

( kids yelling )

KATY: Our mom's gonna be
so mad at us. Come on.

Just wait.

Wait. We're here.
Hey, lady.

We're closed.
Come back tomorrow.

We have the money.
Just give us the car.
We'll be on our way.

Look, girlie...

I'm tired,
my feet hurt,

and my truck
has a flat.

I've had
a really long night.

<i>You've</i>  had a long night?!

Yeah, so don't
mess with Trixie.

Don't mess with
the babysitter.

ALL: Yeah!

Everyone's buckled
up, right?
KIDS: Yes!

Okay, cool, we gotta get
home before your parents
do, so hold on.

HAL: Slowest valet
in the city.

Finally!

They could stand
to hire some more help.
I know.

All right, kiddies,
we gotta move.

Trey, I need you
to get the hose,
rinse off the car.

I'll put it in
the garage later.

Everybody else, get inside,
get on your pajamas fast.
Let's go!

Ready?

Oh... my gosh.

( kids exclaiming )

Look at those bubbles!
Mom is going to freak out!

KATY: Lady Marmalade!

Okay, Emily, get that dog
into a tub and start scrubbing,

and scrub your head
and arms while you're at it.

Jenny, Katy, get some towels,
start mopping up those suds.

Bobby, A.J.,
we're on kitchen duty.

Everybody, go, go, go!
Now, now, now!

HELEN: How long will
it take us to get home?

HAL: We'll be home in
15 minutes, tops.

â™ª â™ª

The car's done.
Dog duty upstairs.

â™ª â™ª

Wow!
Check her out.

( all exclaiming )

Jenny, you guys
better get going.

Everyone else, upstairs
and in bed. Got it?

All right.
What?

Well, we just
wanted to say...

We think you're both
awesome babysitters.

Yeah. This has been
the coolest night of our lives.

For sure.
Absolutely.

I met my hero.

I finally found
my perfect ingredient.

I went to my first gala.

I missed the concert,
but this has been

the best night
of my life.

Yeah. Ours, too.

Yeah.

( giggles )

Okay, you freaks, everybody
get out of here already.

Go, go, go, go, go, go!

JENNY: Buckled up?
KIDS: Yeah.

Let's get going.

HELEN: The house isn't on fire.
So far, so good.

Now don't tell anyone,
Lady Marmalade.

( barks )

( Helen and Hal
speaking indistinctly )

Hi!
Hi.

You guys are home
so soon.

Is everything okay?

Couldn't be better,
Helen.

Your children
are angels.
( relieved sigh )

Jenny, thank you again
so much for everything.

We really hope
your night of babysitting

wasn't as much trouble
as mine.

( laughs )
No. No trouble at all.

( siren wailing )

No!

Officer, I don't think
I was speeding,

but if I was,
there's a very
good reason.

I've had a really...

Driving without a license
is illegal.

Okay, seriously,
you really need
to take a night off.

That's a great idea.

How about Saturday?

Um...

Yeah, yeah,
Saturday works.

Zac. What are you
doing here?

Um, returning
Emily's headphones.

Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe
she would've forgotten those.

She technically didn't.

I asked her if I could
keep them.

You did?

Yeah.
Why?

Um, so I could return them.

Right.

And see you.
EMILY: Ask her out.

Ask<i>  him</i>  out!

( both giggling )

Do you...

Wanna go out with me?
With me?

BOTH: Yes?

Yeah?

( giggling )

Okay.

Great, Zac.
I'll see you tonight.

Um, you're
a little late.

Oh, am I?
Yeah.

Sorry. I guess I just
needed to sleep in

after my date
with Zac last night.

Aw, I'm really happy
for you guys.

And I want you
to know, Jenny,

whatever happens today,
whoever Leon picks,
I'm okay.

Thank you, but
you were right, Lola.

I didn't even know
who Leon Vasquez was

before I read about
this internship.

I like photography,
but no, I don't love it.

Not like you.

I called earlier

and officially withdrew
my application.

I'm taking
the summer off.

What about college
and early admission

and your transcripts?

What about fun
and free time,

and living outside
of the box?

Well, uh...

since you're such an expert
at this college stuff,

maybe you could help me with
my art school applications.

Sure. Friends help
friends, right?

Yeah.

And if you ever need
a recommendation
as a babysitter,

feel free to use my name.

I think I should
probably retire.

Gotcha.

Um, hey, could you
send me the pictures
from the other night?

Yeah, of course.
I'll send them over
to everyone. Come here.

What's this?

Just me being
spontaneous.

Um, I'll see you soon.

Yeah, I'll see you soon.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª I used to think that
good things were so bad â™ª

â™ª No need to hold back,
not me, no more â™ª

â™ª I'm walking this road,
I'm taking control â™ª

â™ª My heart can't say no â™ª

â™ª I'm living on the wild
side, wild side â™ª

â™ª No telling what I might
find, might find â™ª

â™ª No stopping 'cause
it feels right, feels right â™ª

â™ª I'm living on the...
ooh, ooh â™ª

â™ª On the wild side,
wild side â™ª

â™ª So ready,
now it's my time, my time â™ª

â™ª No stopping 'cause
it feels right, feels right â™ª

â™ª I'm living on the...
ooh, ooh â™ª

â™ª I'm living on
the wild side, wild side â™ª
