My name is Charles Bronson. 

2 
All my life I wanted to be famous. 

3 
<i> Want to know what I have done better </ i> 

4 
<i> I had a vocation. </ i> 

5 
<i> Only I did not know which one. </ i> 

6 
<i> Not yet. </ i> 

7 
<i> I could not play. </ i> 

8 
A sort of choice of nature .... 

9 
The film is based on real facts 

10 
<i> How could I explain it? </ i> 

11 
<i> I was raised normally, 
My parents were decent .... </ I> 

12 
<i> They were honest citizens. 
Complied by society. </ I> 

13 
<i> I went to school. 
I tried not to disappoint them. </ I> 

14 
<i> But some kids liked problems. </ i> 

15 
Son of a bitch! 

16 
<i> lot of problems. </ i> 

17 
Michael. 

18 
Mrs. Peterson I must tell you about the behavior ... 

19 
I was not wicked. 

20 
I was not evil "villain. 

21 
I still have my principles. 

22 
<i> I took the first job that I should have fallen under the hands ...</ i> 

23 
Holds up potatoes, 
Peterson. 

24 
<i> I guess the situation 
was not so bad. </ i> 

25 
Madam. Peterson? 

26 
We would like to talk to your son ... 

27 
Michael. 

28 
Michael Peterson? 

29 
That's me. 

30 
Ah. Before I forget, I came to the world as Michael Peterson 

31 
But I am known by my nickname: 

32 
Charles Bronson. 

33 
Who is my alter ego. 

34 
<i> 1974. </ i> 

35 
<i> difficult time for the British youth. </ i> 

36 
<i> No chance of love around. </ i> 

37 
<i> However ...</ i> 

38 
<i> life goes on </ i> 

39 
<i> Irene and me we got married </ i> 

40 
<i> was pretty ... 
it was not a bad life for a couple of middle class. </ i> 

41 
But it does not give you a star on 
The Walk of Fame (Walk of Fame) 
without suffering in return .... 

42 
Michael! 
What's that noise? 

43 
So ... this is the post office where I went ... 

44 
<i> is what I had to live ...</ i> 

45 
And that's what they gave me ... 

46 
Seven years. 

47 
<i> Do not worry, son ... you will not be seven years ....</ i> 

48 
You'll be out in four years. 

49 
Funny is not it? 

50 
I always wanted to be an actor. 

51 
Seven years ... 

52 
It's very long. 

53 
I'm not going to stand here and tell you ... 

54 
... You say ... That the prison is not a "folly". 

55 
No. 

56 
It would be wrong to represent me and I think enough things like this have already been made! 

57 
Not true!? 

58 
No. 

59 
<i> You see, I do not see prison as a cage, a "box" </ i> 

60 
<i> For me it was a hotel room </ i> 

61 
<i> Do not understand wrong ...</ i> 

62 
<i> For the majority of people ...</ i> 

63 
<i> The prison is very hard. </ i> 

64 
<i> With monotonous nightmare </ i> 

65 
<i> for 24 hours a day. </ i> 

66 
<i> Seven days a week. </ i> 

67 
<i> 365 days a year </ i> 

68 
<i> nothing from a symbol of life. </ i> 

69 
<i> breathing ... Hell. </ i> 

70 
<i> But for me ...</ i> 

71 
The prison was a fun 
where I could show other talents ... 

72 
improve my skills. 

73 
It's like a battlefield, you see? 
It was an opportunity ... 

74 
... In a place where soon everyone will know my name. 

75 
What was there, Charlie? 

76 
You want you to watch it again? 
No. 

77 
I am not usually have a fixed workplace. 
It is a training practice 

78 
So you can get a job ... 
Fuck you! 

79 
What is the problem Peterson? 
Problem? 

80 
I said "What is the problem, Peterson?" 

81 
I do not know 
I have no problem. 

82 
Make shit! 

83 
I'm writing my name ... 

84

94 
Nothing brings more joy to my heart as a cup of English tea. 

95 
Sugar and milk? 
No, I prefer without. 

96 
It's an impressive arsenal that you have here, 
it could stop a fight. 

97 
Bang! Bang! And Knock-out ... 

98 
Ding Ding ... 

99 
Very good. 

100 
Time stands still for no man 
Ladies and Gentlemen.

My time was coming. 

102 
The game is over! 

103 
And just when I was going to be known ... 

104 
Like what? 
Like what!? 

105 
You do not want to be stuck with someone like me, "Sunbeam". 

106 
A person that nobody likes to annoy you understand? 

107 
I'm Charles Bronson. 

108 
I am the most dangerous prisoner in England. 

109 
<i> The prison was ...</ i> 

110 
Seriously speaking ... 

111

I am sent here. 

138 
The hospice. 

139 
What fucking place it will save me now? 

140 
Peterson Ok, now that you are calm. 
These are the rules of Rampton. 

141 
First rule: 
You do what you say. 

142 
And the second rule? 

143 
This is not a prison. 

144 
There is no limit here. 

145 
Ok Take these pills. 

146 
Put them up in your fucking ass! 

147 
They want to kiss me 
I will not do any of that here.

You'll never understand.

155 
While they continue to get high. 

156 
What does that make? 

157 
They do not change you inside. 

158 
I think I know the truth. 

159 
You're not really mad, is not it?

Listen ... nurse.

I just want to know when I

Is that clear? 

209 
Wrong! Mr Peterson 

210 
Now lean forward ... 

211 
I'm just having to push my special potions in the buttocks ... 

212 
My trial is happening when? 

213 
Not ... 

214 
Mr. White will do it, 
there will be no hearing. 

215 
Is not this great? 

216 
By cons ... You have been transferred. 

217 
Where? 

218 
Guess Mr. Peterson. 

219 
At the asylum for the criminally insane ... 

220 
I deserve jail

243 
The truth was that he wanted me more 
Nowhere in any way whatsoever. 

244 
Apparently, I managed to cost the system 

245 
Damage of 10 million pounds. 

246 
Then his Majesty 

247 
no longer wishes to be pampered by the most expensive of all the English prisoners. 

248 
However this was not what I was looking ... 

249 
But what I should do? 

250 
I'd go crazy if a 
I did not try to escape ... 

251 
Ah yes ... 

252 
They had more than one trick up their sleeve ... 

253 
They told me sane ... in writing! 

254 
Before you even know I was back in the street ... 

255 
But Charlie B is not crazy ... 

256 
Non Ho ... 

257 
It was then time to breathe fresh air 

258 
and show what the world had to offer. 

259 
Very funny guys. 

260 
It was a pleasure ... 

261 
Come in, son. 

262 
That's ... 

263

we make a good cup of tea. 

264 
Come ... 

265 
That's ... 

266 
Oh ... That's me? 

267 
I was very small. 

268 
Where are all my things? 

269 
I could not take everything, Michael. 
It was at Luton. 

270 
Everything? 
It has kept some ... 

271 
Where is my bed? 

272 
Mama no one there, one I had when I was little. 

273 
We could not keep everything Michael 
we had no place. 

274 
My bed is still in Luton? 

275 
Luton. 

276 
It has never changed, is not it? 

277 
My mother used to say: 
"Stay with what you love." 

278 
Two things had not changed. 

279 
I knew Luton and ... 
I knew Uncle Jack. 

280 
And Uncle Jack knew everybody. 

281 
And while they did not know they were not worth the blow to be known. 

282 
On vacation? 
No. 

283 
I want to know my name. 

284 
How do you go? 

285 
I'm going to kill the queen. 

286 
Then you go to London. 
No. 

287 
At Luton. 

288 
I can not believe my eyes ... 

289 
Come my boy, 
You came just in time for cocktails. 

290

291 
Ladies and gentlemen dressed as women, 

292

It is a pleasure to meet you. 

299 
Ho, Jacky said he was awakened in you party inside. 

300 
Thank you. 

301 
His face torn. 

302 
Kiss should be fun. 

303 
It is remarkable that a mustache you got there. 

304 
I admire your education. 

305 
I always knew you had artistic talent. 

306 
It's a big boy. 

307 
What does the future to 
Michael Peterson? 

308 
Ambition is the virtue of all great men. 

309 
He will stay with us. 

310 
Agree? 

311 
If it suits you. 

312 
No more than you. 

313 
It's very hard. 

314 
Wonderful. 

315 
<i> Uncle Jack was always aware of the rumors. </ i>

333 
No, you need a ...

366 
I have given you the pure magic just now. 
Magic? 

367 
You're just pissed on a gypsy in the middle of nowhere ... 

368 
A "boss" would do it in the city boy. 

369 
Where next? 

370 
Let's go! 

371

372

You are a very gentle man, Charlie. 

394 
But thanks to you. 

395 
But you have no ambition. 
You know what that means?
