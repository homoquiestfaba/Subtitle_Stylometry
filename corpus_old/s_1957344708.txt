I think I'm just wondering,

I'm going through
these magazines

out what to give you.

Nice try, dad.

No really, I mean.

No, really.

If you could have
anything in the world

I don't know.

There's gotta be something.

How would you pay for gas?

wouldn't really matter.

I'll have a mansion.

Well, when you

[both chattering indistinctly]


Is your note for Santa ready?

believe in Santa.

Only little kids do.

I believe in him.

I think the people
who don't are stupid.

Really?

Then how does he
get in the house?

I think elves make keys.

Either that or he shrinks
in and goes down the chimney

but I mean I don't know.

As long as you make a note,
he'll get your a gift.

Really?
Yeah.

[Nico laughing]

Pepperoni?

Okay, I'll get some pepperoni.

He's coming home soon.

Yeah.

"The moment you doubt
whether you can fly,

you cease forever to do it.

So come with me
where dreams are born

and time is never planned.

Just think of happy things

wings forever in Never Land."

Gotta put this up here

Hugging a tree is a bitch
under any circumstances.

[Adam laughs]

I'm okay, Billy,

This just here is
a very special one

for a very special
person that I have.

So let's bring it
into the living room.

Okay.
Slow, slow.

Shh, you have to be quiet.

Joy to the world, sweetheart!

[door creaking]

I was gonna bring a
present for your mom,

but I don't want to
come on too strong

'cause Freddie said
to me, "Fuck it!"

Freddie said,
"Fuck it, fuck it."

And I said,

"You know you can't fucking
talking to me like that.

'Cause that's my
wife, that's my wife.


She loves Chinese.

You know what we're going to do?

We were going take her
to Chinese tomorrow.

That's what I'm gonna do.

She thinks I hate it.

I do hate it actually.

But I'm gonna get
her the Moo Shu Pork

I'm gonna get her
the Moo Shu Pork,

'cause she loves that Moo Shu.

She loves the Moo Shu.

I'm going to get it for her.

I'm going to get a Moo Shu,

it comes with little cookies.

I was so mean about that.

I don't want to be mean.

I wanted to her to
have Chinese food.

Hey, dad!

Shh.

Hey you!

Merry Christmas, sweetheart!


You two are the only thing
that's true, you know that?

You two kids are the
only thing that's true.

And you're the only
good thing I ever did.

And I'm really happy that
you're my kid, you know that?


I love you dad, I love you!

Hey!

Hey, Old Man!

I got a tree.

Yeah.
Yep!

Good night, dad.

Don't ask me where I got it,

that's between me and the
surveillance camera at Walmart.

Hey, young man!

You got strong, huh?

There we go.

There we go.

Everything's all

Hey, Billy!

You got wild hair like your ma.

You know what, Billy?

When was the last
time I cut your hair?

I'm going for a trim.
Let's lay down, dad.

No, no.

Go get them scissors.

This is going to be
better I'm telling you.

Lay down, dad.
I haven't trimmed your hair

for a long time.
Lay down.

Hey, get me the scissors
and I'm going to cut.

Hey I'm telling it's
going to be good.

No.



Don't say no just do

[bottle shattering]

What do you mean stop?

Hey!

Dad, stop!

I asked you, come on.

Please dad, get off.

Get off!

Dad please!

Let go of her, please!

Open the door!

Don't do it, dad!

You're drunk, dad!
I know what I am.

I'm your father.

You sit your ass down
now do what I say.

Nico, stop!

[ukulele smashing]


I'll kill you!

Dad, can you hear me?

Let her go!

Don't worry about it!

That's a little
cheap toy anyway.

I'm going get
another one of those.

You can't have this anymore.

Nico, I'm saying I'm just going
to trim your sister's hair.

I never should have
never let this grow.

That's going go a lot
easier, you just sit still.

You sit still.

All right.

You only get to be a
kid once, you know?

Well you only get
to be a kid once.

It's going to be all right,
it's going to be better.

I know what I'm
doing, this is better,

this is better for you.

Just think about it
like a Christmas trim.

It's a Christmas trim
for you, sweetheart.

It's okay.

You're okay.

Shhh.

It'll come back.

you do to your hair?

I did it for you.

I didn't want you to be alone.

Daddy doesn't mean it.

He's just sad.

[light orchestral music]

I promise.

I got limes.

I got the last bag of ice.

The other store was out of ice,

so I had to go all
the way to Dublin.

I got to go.

I'm here.

Hey!

What are you doing here?

I didn't recognize you
without all that hair.

I wanted to see you.

Well, I'm sorry about
that Christmas bust,

your dad kinda screwed that up.

I got you and your
brother presents.

Thank you.

I would have brought
them If I had known.

Hey, sweet cheeks!

Hurry it up, huh!

Just a second.

I'm talking to my kid.

Tell your mom bars
need to tend themselves.

As you can see this is not
the best time to chit chat.

Maybe I can come by
your place sometime.

Yeah, I'd like that.

Beaux loves kids.

Look, can tell your brother
I said merry Christmas

and that I got him
a present, okay?

So maybe we can come and
visit with you sometime?

Yeah sure, sweetheart.

I'll talk to Beaux.

We'll make a plan.

Okay?

missed school most days.

Daddy didn't seem to notice.

We stopped popping tires

and found other stuff
to do for money.

[upbeat music]

Thank you.

No, get that
toilet out of here.

I told you.

I don't want it in here.


Get it out of here.

talking but he was drinking.

[Man] Think fast.
Hey, fuck you.


Yeah, all right, sons
of bitches, here we go.

â™ª Sure watch the curveballs â™ª

â™ª I see them fine â™ª

â™ª Sail on to tomorrow â™ª

[Adam coughing]

â™ª And I'll show up and talk â™ª

Give me that.

[Adam groaning]

Give me the fucking bottle.

Give me that, give
me that bottle.

[Adam laughing]

[Adam laughing]

Hey, come on, baby.

Get off him.

Leave him alone.

Hey, buddy.

Hey, sweetheart!

You okay, partner?

I'm right here.

Just...

Hey!

Sweetheart.

Wait a minute.

I'm just okay, everything' okay.

I've just, it was a funny
thing happened to me.

Get off him!


I'm okay.

Nico!

Sit down.

Whoa, here we go.

Whoa, whoa, here we go.

[Adam laughing]

â™ª So old again â™ª


And Nico and I had to run
out of the things to sell.

Billie was right, my
hair was growing back.

We sometimes saw
momma on the weekends.

[all shouting]

They took daddy to a place
to stop his drinking.

They didn't really give him
a choice one way or another.

You get a scar from
playing with that knife.

You have really long thumbs.

It might be because
you're smarter.

See how that,

we get same kind of hands.

[Adam sighing]

You know the judge says

that I got to beat this thing.

How long?

A month, six weeks.

You can't be with us?

Yeah, sure I can be with you.

It's just that I gotta
get better first?

You know?

You don't want your daddy
to act crazy, do you?

Huh?

No.
Me neither.

You know mom says she
could let you stay with her

for the summer.

She says you could stay at
the beach cottage out there,

go swim and everything.

That should be fun, right?

You like swimming?

You don't like swimming?

You like swimming?

I gotta...


Sorry, I gotta go to a meeting.

Take care of your sister

because you're the
most toughest thing,

I'm going to see you take
care of her, you promise?

Promise.


And we went to stay with mom

and her boyfriend
Beaux's beach house.

[upbeat music]

â™ª Hit it â™ª

They did a different
kind of drinking,

but they were still drinking.

[Beaux whistling]

And drinking.

Hurry up!

More.
More!

Where did you go?


Mmmm.


Mom.

Is that all?
All out of Vodka.


[Eve laughing]

[Eve laughing]

[Eve laughing]


[Eve laughing]

Hey baby!

Could you give me cold beer?


I hope hope you don't
serve piss warm beer

like this one to our customers.

Oh you know you're
welcome to help yourself.

Help myself?

Get me a cold one.

Yeah, get it yourself.


You see what happens to
smart asses around here?

Now get me a cold one.

Why'd you do that?

Get me a cold one.

I'll get one.

Your mother will get it.

Pour it.

Why are you doing this
in front of my kids?

Be a nice mommy.

Pour the beer and sit
your fat ass down.

Hey, kid.

Have a drink.

It's been a long day.

You deserve it.

Please don't.
He's not mad.

Are you champ?

Gonna grow up to be big
and strong like his daddy,

be able to handle his liquor.

Go ahead kid, have a drink.

Go ahead.


I'm dealing with
snowflakes here, huh?

You're going to turn this
kid into a goddam queer.

Everybody loves a food fight.

Stop.

Best party I've been
to since New Years Eve.

I can't wait to
do it again, guys!

What a night.

Ha!

[both shouting]

[Eve grunting]

He's killing her.

I miss daddy.

[light orchestral music]

[fireworks popping]
[all shouting]

You kids armed,
you guys armed?

How old are you?

Mind your own business.

Old enough to be on the team.

[all shouting]
[singing in foreign language]

Wait up!

Smart guy, huh?

His name's Nico.

What's your name?
Billy.

Like Billy Holiday?

Can you sing?

We gotta get home now.

Where do you live?

Down there.

I live down there too.

See you!

That kid's lucky I didn't
punch him in the face.

[singing in foreign language]
[light orchestral music]

You kids behave
yourselves today.

Okay?

Beaux can't take care of you.

He has got his own stuff.

And no sulking.

No sulking around.

It will only piss him off.

All right.

He's not used to you
kids and all the energy

that you bring to the party.

And I really think one or
both of you needs to apologize

for upsetting him
in the first place.

All right?

Why?

I just think that things
would go a lot smoother

if you apologize so
he can feel better

about you guys
ruining his time off.

He didn't sign up for this.
Whoo!

Come on, baby.

Okay, okay, okay, stop it.

Sticky bun in the oven
and coffee's right there.

It's fresh.


What?

They would like to
apologize for last night.

I think they're
just feeling too shy

or a little too ungrateful

right now to make
the effort right now.

No apologies necessary.

We are 100% cool, right guys?

He asked you a question.
Ease off 'em a little, huh?

I get it.

My old man beat
the shit outta me

when I got outta line
and I forgave him.

Plus me and the kid are
going fishing today.

Set everything straight,
okay with you kid?

With worms?

With any goddamn
thing that works.


Thank you.

You are most certainly
welcome, young man.

And for you, young lady,

maybe I'll take you to
get a pedicure later.

You boys have a
good time, okay?

Okay.

â™ª And I would drink
clear clean water â™ª

â™ª For to quench my thirst â™ª

â™ª I shall watch
the ferry boats â™ª

â™ª And they'll get high â™ª

â™ª On a blue ocean â™ª

[distant shouting]

[shouting indistinctly]

Hey.
Hey.

Were you the one singing?


You have a beautiful voice.

You know that Billy Holiday

was born in a house
of ill repute?

You like her?

Hard not to if you like her.

She was beautiful.

My dad named me after her.

Is your dad the guy
with the chunky arms?

That's not my dad.

Do you wanna do something?

Like what?

Come on.


My mother's.

[engine starting]

Get in.

[both laughing]

Oh shit.

Sorry.

[both laughing]

[upbeat music]

I bet you didn't inhale?


Where are we going?

I'll show you.


Oh God, I feel ill.

right and our own spot.

We'll put the
emergency brake on.

Get around town.

All right, come on.

Oh God.

I feel dizzy.

Yeah.

Nobody knows about this place.

How did you find it?

Me and my dad used
to go fishing here.

your mom's car, right?

No, it wasn't.

We should walk back.

All right, see you.

[Beaux humming]

You move fast.


Hey!

You showed your sister
what we caught today?

I caught it.

He was next to me the
whole time, the little guy.

We had a lot of fun today.

Didn't we, champ?

Your brother's a bit of a pussy.

I think so too.

What happened, Nico?

Did he hit you?

I am not a pussy.

Talk to me, what happened?

He pulled out his penis.

What?

Did he hurt you?

I'm not a pussy.

Don't tell.

[banging on door]

stink up the joint.

I gotta take a dump.

Come on!

Let's go.

Hey everybody, momma's home!

[Beaux laughing]

No hello?

Mom, you need
to know something.

I need to get
these clothes off.

Jesus, you can't wait?

caught something of her own.

I told her she works
faster than her mother.


Don't tell me
you're high on weed?

No, mom.

Beaux did something.

Did he give you weed?

No, he made Nico look at him.

Did what?

He made Nico
touch his privates.

How dare you?

I knew it was a mistake
to bring you here.

Now you're going to make
some shit up like that!


Who is gonna help me
cook this sucker, huh?

Get in here.

I don't wanna hear another
fucking word about this.

You understand me?

You keep your little porn
fantasies to yourself.

All right?

Nico didn't make it up.

You fucking ruin this,
I'll go ape shit on you.

You understand me?

ain't gonna cook itself.

Just a second!

Don't fucking ruin it!

[both laughing]

Maybe your lover boy
wants to join us for dinner.

He better wear protections.


knows all about that.

All right stop it.

Oh my god, I'm out of
smokes for god's sake.

I gotta go sown to the package
store to pick up some smokes.

You wanna come out?

I can't right now.

Why not?

I have to be with my brother.

You can just tell him to come.

I don't know.



get cigarettes and beer.

Get your things, we're going.

Where are we going?
I don't know.

To get dad.

Hurry up!

[Beaux humming]

Stay here, don't move.

out, wherever you are.

I know you're in here.

I thought we had
an understanding

about what happens
to tattle tales.

Apparently not.

No.

I can be a fun guy, given
half the chance, if I'm happy.

You could ask your
mother about that.

And now I'm getting happy.

[Beaux grunting]


Motherfucker!


Let's get the fuck outta here!

Come on.

Wait.
Nico, what are you doing?

Come on!

[soft music]

[all chattering]

[fireworks popping]

So, what if we killed him?

He deserved it.

I think I killed him.

For the record I killed him.

It's pretty easy to prove
something it was self defense.

Looks like a molester
from a mile away.

What are we going to do now?

My dad lives in Florida.

So we're on the run?

Yeah, we're outlaws
and renegades.

Outlaws and renegades.

Yep.


[all whooping]
[fireworks popping]

[light piano music]

It looks good on you.

Thank you.

For a second, I thought you
weren't going to come back up.

I like to dive.

weren't scared huh?

You don't swim?

I actually don't.

These things suck.

Now no one can find us.

[soft music]

know no one's home?

houses and they don't use it.

Aren't there alarms?

Probably.

how to do so many things?

Because I read.

Wow this is so cool.

[upbeat piano music]

Come on.


[Billy laughing]

Yeah.



[Billy laughing]

Yeah.



starts to move

as soon as "Pata
Pata" starts to play.

Whooo!


Clap!


Clap!


Oh shit.
Clap!

Clap!


Clap.

[both laughing]

[gun firing]

What the -

Nico, what the fuck!

I didn't know it was real.

Holy shit.

Nice shot.

Not funny!




A butt.

That took me, oh, I thought
that was something else, bro.

Wait, wait, wait.

Billy, are we convicts?

No.

We are just kids.

We're just ne'er do
well punk ass kids.

What's a ne'er do well?

A ne'er do well is
people that don't do good.

That's a cool scar.

Coolest scar I
have on my body is

maybe the one next
to my eye right here?

I mean it really hurt because
I smashed it on the window.


I fell in a bush.

Let me have a look at that.

It used to go
all the way down.

Yeah.

What is that?

One more scar.

I remember I was whittling once.

And I missed the stick.

Oh shoot!

This was recent.

I thought that Dad gave you.

Nico, I didn't know
you had so many.

have scars anymore.

But I did have a lot before.

I got you all beat, okay.


It's a smiley face.
Oh my God.

How did you get that?

I got it from
when I was a baby.

I was crawling under an iron
board and it fell on me.

can't beat that.

It sucks.

It's pretty bad.

That's, Jesus!

I'm kind of tired.
You want to go to sleep?



Billy?
Yeah?

I have bad
thoughts in my head.

Bad how?
Things.

Like bad things?

You want to talk about it?

Okay.

I miss daddy.

Me too.

play that song?


Go to sleep.

â™ª And I shall stroll
the merry way â™ª

â™ª And jump the hedges first â™ª

â™ª And I'll drink the
clear clean water â™ª

â™ª For to quench my thirst â™ª

â™ª And I shall watch
the ferry boats â™ª

â™ª And they'll get high â™ª

â™ª On a blue ocean â™ª

â™ª Against tomorrow's sky â™ª

You have a nice voice.

Thank you.

I lied about
how I got my scar.

When I was like two
and a half years ago,

I threw a Barbie doll
to my little sister

and my mom got really pissed
and she hit me really hard

with a belt and like you
can see my skin and my bone.

And uh, the cops were
called, the firemen came.

And then I got taken away
for 10 years, from my mom.

She had to work very
hard to get me back.

When she drinks she's
not the same person.


And my dad couldn't take us
because he was in prison.

He was supposed to
come pick me up.

But I guess he got too busy.

So I guess I'll just go
down there and see him.

Anyway, it looks good.

It looks like a smiley face.

You can maybe sing
that song to me.

The one that you sing for Nico.

I'm mad tired.

Too much fun.

â™ª And I will raise my hand up â™ª

â™ª Into the night time sky â™ª

â™ª Count the stars that shine â™ª

â™ª In your eyes â™ª

â™ª And I will never ever
grow so old again â™ª

â™ª We will walk and
talk in gardens â™ª

â™ª All wet with rain â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª Sweet thing â™ª


[floor creaking]

[crickets chirping]


You okay?

Yeah.
Good.

[light orchestral music]

What did you see?
You ending my life.

[all laughing]

[all chattering indistinctly]




[Malik urinating]

I can swim better than anyone.

And I'm only 11.


[light guitar music]

Three four, shut the door.

Five six, pick up sticks.

[all chattering]

Other than the fact it's
the most disturbing thing

I have ever done?

It's not that bad.

Oh very cool.

In fact, fucking amazing.


Yo, come on guys!

Check it out!

Hurry up!

You're mad slow.

Come on.

Smells like dog food.


Imagine your favorite
food and take a bite.


Calamari.

[Billy coughing]

are we going to go?

South.

My dad lives in Florida.

It's practically like a
different country down there.

hey have snakes as long as cars,

monkeys, and trees.

Can I have one as a pet?
What about our dad?


He can make old friends.

have good schools for Nico?


Can't be any worse than
the ones we got here.

be home-schooled.

Holiday spent the last years

of her life down there.


it's way nicer than here.


It's really cold

I think we should just
go back to the boat.

It's a really bad idea.

Shhhhh.

Everybody!

Shhh.

Keep it down, okay?

I don't want her to
know I am out here.

Don't you know that by now?

We gotta go.


We gotta get going now.

Help me.

Would you do that?

Yeah.
I have tremors.

You ever seen a tremor?

Ready?

I'm down to one,
one before dinner.


There you go.

Thank you very much,
I appreciate that.

You're welcome.

We should get going.

Oh yeah?

Well if you gotta
go, you gotta go.

Hey listen let me
ask you a question.

I'm down to one right
before dinner, you know?

Hey hey hey!

Come on.

What's going on?

Are you running from something?

Are you running
away from something?

No we're just taking a walk.

Can I come?

Can I?

Well, you're kind of old.

Kind of old?

Who are you kids?

We're renegades and outlaws.

Well, if you want to
stay with me, you can.

That's if she'll have you,

if she'll have you.

That's very sweet.

Thank you.

And that's if you are hungry.

I'm hungry.
Me too.


You like tuna casserole?

Yeah.
You do?

Help me up.


I'm down to one.

Don't tell her you
gotta do me that favor.

I'm not going to tell her.
No.

You won't say anything either?

I won't say anything.
You wont say a word.

Follow me!

Well, wash up, help yourselves
to a plate and have a seat.

Wash them clean now.

Okay.


Be careful, take your time.

You don't want to get
sick, there's plenty here.

It's so good.
This food is great.

Well I'm glad
you're enjoying it.


kids from the park?

No, we're just
passing through.

Oh, passing through?

Yeah, they're outlaws.
And gangsters.

imagine that.

I'll be joining them.

Right?

Yeah.

Well, you be my guest,

but if you get caught, I
won't be there to get you out.

We don't get caught.

Oh.

So so your parents
know you are outlaws?

My dad's in the
hospital, getting better.

Oh he's sick?
He drinks a lot.

This is great food
Louise, thank you.

Thank you.

I don't believe
I know your name?

Billy.

My name is Billy.

A little bit.

That is a big deal, you know?

That is a big deal.

Yes it is.

Have you been smoking
again, sweetheart?

Why do you ask me?

He didn't smoke.

He wasn't smoking.


That smells little
like smoke over here.

Well I was outside.
Okay.

Okay.

Hold on for a second.

I think I am about
to bust a gut.


I'm really stuffed.

I told you that her tuna
casserole was the best.

Didn't I?


it really tastes good too,

doesn't it?

Yes.

so much, it's great.

You're very welcome.

You know, when I am done
we really have to get going.

Well if you want to
leave, that's okay.

But I think I'd like to
take Billy in the back

and let's do something
fun with your hair, okay?

We're going to have some fun.

[imitating whirring]

[all laughing]

Yeah, okay.

Children are such magic.

Then they grow into
little miracles.

Then they become people
all on their own.

Todd.

To let our child go.

[light orchestral music]

I never had a daughter.

But if I did, I bet she'd
be pretty just like you.

of lonely and sweet.

I think they wanted us to stay.

It felt kind of like home.

[all laughing]

They let us stay the night
in their son's camper.

You guys sleep tight.

Tomrrow, we'll have
some fun, okay?

Okay.

When I'm an adult
I want one of these.

We have to leave
really early tomorrow.

Why can't we stay?

Don't you want
to go to Florida?

No.

You really want
to leave tomorrow?

Fuck yeah, this
place is a dump.

You guys don't want to leave?

I have to leave.

I killed someone.

Billy, what happens to
kids that kill people?

I don't know, Nico.

You're fine.

I killed him, Billy.
Nico, no, you didn't.

You're fine.

He's probably fine.

police that I killed him.

Nico, it was self
defense, you're fine.

I don't want to be
a gangster anymore.

Close your eyes.

Don't worry.

I'm sorry I got pissed at you.

We can go with you.

You don't have to.

We're blood brothers, right?

No surrender.

[chimes ringing]

They turned us in.

The police are here.

Hey!

What are you doing?

Just tell them I'm
the one who did it.

No.

Wait, stop!

Where are you going?


[banging on door]

Are you okay?

[gun firing]

[dramatic orchestral music]


gonna be all right.

[Billy screaming]
[dramatic orchestral music]

[siren wailing]

Billie must have made sure

that the bullet did not
hit any major arteries.

The doctor said

that it was a miracle
that he made it.

The police said that
it was an accident,

even though he was
shot from behind.

It was like Malik was asleep.

He couldn't remember
me and Nico.

Dad came home and he was okay.

He was happy.

I had some time on my hands.

where he was now.

I wonder if he was scared.

Or maybe he was floating.
