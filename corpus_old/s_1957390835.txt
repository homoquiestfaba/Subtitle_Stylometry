I'm not getting out of the car.</i>

Then it should be on the registration.
That should be in your glove compartment.

I'm working a convicted felon,

I need someone to send a unit over there.

<i>Okay, uh, how do you know
the kids are in there?</i>

I spoke to a girl, Abby.

<i>All right, and are the parents home?</i>

No. He took her and they're mobile

<i>- And did you talk to CHP?</i>
Yes. But CHP is looking for the vehicle.

Sarge, lookâ€¦ [sighs]

clues to where they're going over at his.

Kick his fucking door in.

<i>Joe, excuse me?</i>

I talked to a terrified six-year-old girl,

and I promised her
that her mother would come home.

<i>I'm assuming that
there's no warrant for his residence.</i>

<i>So I'm gonna send someone
to the mother's house to check on the kid.</i>

No. I need you
to send a unit over to his house,

and I need you
to send a unit over to her house.

<i>- Joe, it's too much...</i>
No, God damn it, Bill!

There is a scared little girl
whose mother has been abducted.

<i>That's enough! It's enough!
What are you trying to do?</i>

<i>You are in enough trouble already.</i>

<i>I will send a car to the mother's house,</i>

<i>but I'm not gonna have
anyone kicking in any fucking doors.</i>

<i>It's not your job.</i>

I know that.
<i>- Yeah, well, apparently you don't.</i>

<i>Does this have
anything to do with tomorrow?</i>

What? No. I'm just trying toâ€¦
[high-pitched ringing]

<i>- You want to talk to a new psychologist?</i>
[coughing] I'm just trying to help.

<i>- Do you need to do that?</i>
No.

<i>I mean, I know
you didn't get along with the last one.</i>

No. I'm fine.

<i>- What's that?</i>
No, I'm fine.

<i>Okay. All right.
So then, when are you off?</i>

I don't know. Uh, ten minutes.

<i>Okay, good.
You're gonna go to court tomorrow.</i>

<i>Afterwards, you'll be back on the street,
and you'll be off the phone.</i>

[Joe sighs]

<i>- That's what you want, isn't it?</i>
Yeah.

<i>- Isn't it, Joe?</i>
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

[breathing heavily]
<i>- All right. Okay.</i>

Were they over at our house?

<i>Stop. I'm notâ€¦ I'm not doing this, Joe.</i>

Why did you just call me? Tell me that.

They weren't over at our house?
<i>- No. Nobody came to our house, all right?</i>

<i>Okay?</i>

Are you coming tomorrow?

<i>I don't really think
that's such a good idea.</i>

'Cause you know it would look really good
to have the wife there, you know?

<i>Right. Yeah. Okay.</i>

She's six years old!

What do you think she was gonna do?

She is covered in his blood.

Henry, this stops here, right now.

You stop the car, and you tell me
where you are. I will send help.

[crying] <i>I can't do that.</i>
You have to.

<i>What if I doâ€¦</i>

Yes?

To you? You go back to prison.

<i>Yeah, no, that can't happen.</i>

That can't happen? That can't happen?

What do you want me to say?

Put your phone in your pocket.

And when he opens those doors,

you take that brick and you hit him
in the head as hard as you can.

He deserves it.

That's right.

Now put your phone away.

Put in your pocket.

Just put the phone away when he opens...

<i>Oliver's fine. He isn't even crying now.</i>

What was that?

[Emily continues crying]

<i>The snakes.</i>

Snakes? What snakes?

<i>He was in so much pain.</i>

<i>They wereâ€¦ in his stomach.</i>

<i>He kept crying

<i>- Why?</i>
I wanna help her.

<i>Huh?</i>

Yes, that is my job.

<i>Let me tell you something. Nobody helps.</i>

<i>We, uhâ€¦</i>

<i>Discount ran out, man.</i>

<i>We said we'd try,
that we'd try to do it without her meds.</i>

<i>Oh my God! Oh my God!</i>

you know, like, because Iâ€¦</i>

<i>Oh my God.</i>

[Henry sighs]
[clattering over phone]

Henry? What are you doing?

<i>Oh my God, Abby.
I should never have left her.</i>

No, no. Henry,
the police are with her. Henâ€¦ Henâ€¦

Henry. Henry, I'm gonna
need you to try and calm down.

[Henry sobbing]

<i>She's just a little babyâ€¦

<i>I told her not to go in there.
Oh my God. I need to get Abby.</i>

[engine starts over phone]
No, Henry. Henry, listen to me.

Henry, the police have her.
The police. She is safe. She is safe.

She is fine. She is fine.

Where is Emily? We have to find Emily.
[Henry crying] <i>I don't know.</i>

Henry?
<i>- I don't know where she is.</i>

Henry, do you think
that she could harm herself?

<i>I don't know.
I don't know. Listen. Just listen.</i>

<i>Listen to me. Okay? Listen.</i>

<i>She has no idea what she's done.</i>


<i>She thinks that she helped Oliver.</i>

<i>I didn't have
the heart to tell her that sheâ€¦</i>

<i>Oh God, she wasn't always like this.</i>

<i>She's just sick.</i>

<i>And I justâ€¦
I needed to help her. She's justâ€¦</i>
