Overworked so that your hands still 't run, and you could not stop.

I know that very well.

What right have they to our hard obtained honey?

But it's our yoghurt evening. - Doegie.

Why is so difficult evening yoghurt?

Poor thing, you are already d'r hours doing.

Yes. And Adam helps great.

How much sugar do you want? One - but, I want quiet. "

Why you help me?

Bees have good qualities. - Yes, please.

And 't feels good to not even need to be done to thinking.

I do not know why, but people now give each other bouquets of ballonen.

Yes, those are super ... If you are three.

Of art flowers. - Here I am totally disturbed.

Yes, I do. Die-sharp leaves, the senseless pollination.

You bees should fake plastic things hated.

There is nothing worse than a daffodil, which is edited.

Well perhaps that this' t than a little good.

You know Barry, this lawsuit is something quite grand.

I think 't too. - Are you sure you want to do?

Whether I am sure?

If I am ready, the people no longer say:

"Honingbijtje I am at home", without having to pay for it.

It is an amazing scene here in Manhattem ...

Because all ears and eyes focused, because for the first time in the history…

We will hear all of a honingbij really can talk.

What if you are not loud enough, Barry?

I do not. But it's very big, you think not?

I can not believe that so many people are free daytime.

Do you think that millions of multinational food, good lawyers?

Everyone must remain behind the fence.

What's going on? - I do not know, I just got a chill.

If we 'tB team do not have.

Have any of you participated in this?

All. High court Bumbleton leads this session.

Case Number 4475 't high courts of New York,

Barry B Benson against the Honey Industry, will now start.

Mr.. Montgomery you represented all five major food chains? "It is for me an honor.

Mr.. Benson ... You represented all bees of this world?

But I make a joke. Honorable Yes, we are ready to proceed.

Mr.. Montgomery let me your openingspleidooi hear?

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury ...

My grandmother was a simple man, who was born on a farm ...

They believed that 't was her human right,

To take advantage of the gifts that nature gives us.

If we could stay where Mr.. Benson's our sketch ...

Do you agree, how 't would be then.

Maybe I should negotiate with the caterpillars, on the side of my elastic.

A talking here?

How do we know whether 't not some kind of holographic film vastleggende tovenarij?

They were sometimes able to use laser beams.

Robots, poppenspelers, kleifiguren, "t he same money to the steroids.

Mr.. Benson.

Ladies and gentlemen, this has nothing to trucage to make, but I am an ordinary.

And as for, honey is very important for me.

It is important for all bees. We have 't invented. We make it.

And we protect 't with our lives.

Unfortunately, there are people in this room,

Who think that they all of us can afpakken because we are small.

What I hope is that if all of this is over ...

You realize that if you steal our honey, you not only diminish what we have everything ...

But everything we are.

I wish that he always did dress. He looks so beautiful.

Call your first witness.

Mr.. Claus Vanderheyden of honingboerderij. Best is a great company that you have.

I suppose so.

And I see that you Honeyburton and Honron possession.

Yes, supplying beekeepers for our farms.

Bijenhouders I find a great word to be honest ...

I presume that you do not bijbevrijders employed, or did you?

No. - Sorry, but I verstond you not.

No. - No, because you are not free bees.

You keep bees. But not only that ...

'T show that you thought that a jar in the shape of a bear was very appropriate.

Well 't been a nice animals, Yogibear, Fuzzy bear, and Bill the Bear.

Yes. You mean like this?

Bears murder bees.

How would you describe 't find this great haarbal your living room to walk?

That he bites into your bank, your cushions apart.

That is enough, but take him back.

Mr.. Sting, we thank you want to be here.

Your name, I find interesting, which I have already heard once before?

I was in a band, The Police.

But you have never been a policeman, either? - No, that is true.

No, that you have not.

And so we have yet another example ...

A man who knows anything from the bijencultuur steals for nothing less than a beautiful show business name.

Come on now, please.

Do you ever sometimes put, Mr.. Sting? Because I feel good fooled, Sting.

Or should I say, Mr.. M Gordon Sumner?

Is that his real name? Idioot.

Mr.. Liotta firstly, I would like to congratulate you on your Emmy Award,

You won your guest in ER, 2005. - Thank you.

I see on your resume that you are clever stunning, and you a brief lontje.

I have fun with what I do. Is that so bad?

Not no, but this is where you come are Mr.. Liotta ...

'T exploiting small helpless bees, so you do not have to rehearse for your role, sir?

Watch out Benson, I can just shoot from my sheet.

This is not a good guy, but a bad guy.

Why get there nobody on this small engerd, then we can all go home.

Order in the courtroom. - You guys are all crazy.

Order I had said. Please Ga.

I thought 't very nice of that beer, which just joined.

I tell you, the jury is on our side.

Are we doing everything okay, I mean legally?

I am a florist. - Yeah, ok.

Let us toosten on a super team. - On a super team.

Also hello.

Hello. - I thought that you would not come.

No, I am only too late. I tried to call, but the battery ...

I wanted this not throw away, so I called Barry.

Fortunately, he was free. - Yes. - There you have it than luck.

There is still a little left. I 't be hot for you.

Yes heat it, what you want.

I hear that you can pretty tennis?

I have not so much with that game, I think the ball quite desirable.

That is my normal. Exactly there.

Barry looked at your CV ...

And he was' t agree with me that sticks not eat a real special skill.

Think you that I can not do?

Hey listen, I know how difficult it's suitable for the job.

That is something we definitely have in common.

Is that so?

Well, we bees have no unemployment, but we have jobs like her.

That I was just planning to do so.

Ken, I have Barry you scheermesje borrowed for his angel sharpen them.

I hope that was in order.

I go my angel hanging in the pot. - Yes, please do that again.

You know, I 't had with your hersenspinsels.

What's that? - The Italian Vogue.

These are many pages. - There are many ads.

Think of what Vanessa said, why is your life worth more than that of me.

That is funny, that I can no longer remember.

I believe that something stinks here.

I love the smell of flowers.

Yes? What do you think of the smell of flames?

Not so tasty.

I am but an insect, I am neutral.

Ken now look again, I wear a vingerhoed as a hat. This is ridiculous.

I have other problems.

Look, a Royal Flush. - You bluft.

Is that so?

Surf's Up, makker. - Gatver, poepwater.

That pot is intact. That dirty-yellow rings after.

Kenny, what are you doing?

You know, I do not even honey. I eat disagree.

We need to talk. He is just a little one.

And he has the best chance to that in a long time I have met before.

In a long time? Where did you 't about?

Are there more insects in your life?

No, but there are other things that stabbing me, and you are one of them.

Good. Speaking with bees, no more evenings yogurt ...

My brain touch of battle with this emotional roller coaster riding.

Goodbye, Ken.

And for you, I love artificial sweeteners made, which are made by people.

Excuse me.

I know that 't an after taste, but I find tasty.

I have always known that there is a kind of barrier between Ken and myself stood.

I can not ousting. Well yes.

Feel you can still be good for the lawsuit tomorrow?

I think that Mr.. Montgomery no longer has ideas.

We would like Mr.. Barry Benson B calls as a witness.

Look it is now even a good idea.

You can be here to see why he is considered as one of the best lawyers ...

Layton, you will have to use some magic with this jury, or else everything is over.

Do not worry, Mr.. Gamble ...

All I need to do to this jury for us to win is ...

To have them remember what they did not like it to bees.

Did you 't tweezers? - Are you allergic?

Only to lose, boy.

Mr.. Benson B, I ask you what we would all like to know ...

What is your relationship with that woman?

We are friends. - Good friends?

Yes. - How good? Living together you?

Wait a minute ... what - Are you her little bedmug?

This is not 't kind of relative ... - I already have a couple bijtje seen in my life ...

And what I have learned from this experience is that the queen all small bijtje concern in the basket.

Yes, but ... - So these are not even your real parents?

That they do. - Notify me against!

You are an unlawful bijtje or not Benson?

He kleineert the bees.

And do you 't not all with you nephews and nieces?

I protest. - I agree that vent stabbing.

Adam not do, this is what he wants.

I am concerned.

Dear God, I am hit. - Order!

The poison ... The poison causes that I go ijlen.

I am down by a beast of the destruction.

See you. You can not treat as an equal, 't be biting barbarians.

They use 't only thing they know, if they happen to be.

Adam hold on. - I no longer feel my legs.

Dear angel of mercy, come to me and suction 't poison from my beautiful kontje.

I want order in my courtroom.

Order! Order, please!

Thank you.

He friend. Do you have so much pain? - Yes.

I have ...

Everything verknalt, eh? - That gives nothing, 't most important thing is that you are still alive.

You had death can be. - That was perhaps better.

Take a look. They have 't out of the cafeteria.

They have 't start from the bottom. 'T Come out of a tuna sandwich. There are even some celery.

How felt 't to make a stabbing?

I can 't explain not. Adrenaline, a form of ecstasy.

Okay.

Do you think 't was a trap? - Of course. 'T Spijt me, I have let it run us.

What would I do not. See us again, we are only a couple of small insects in this world.

What do you think the people with us will do if they win?

I do not know.

I have heard that they kakkerlakken in a hotel have stopped. That does not sound bad.

Adam they check in, but they never check out.

Would you ask for a sister can 't be closed window? - Why?

They smoke. Bees smoking.

Correct. Bees smoking.

Bees not smoking, but some do. That is' t, that is our indictment.

Is that so? So it is not yet done?

No, you cloth. I have to go somewhere. Keep you clean up as much as possible.

And assuming that you step 22 well have ...

Are you ready for the bathtub.

Mr.. Flayman. - Yes, honorable.

Where is the rest of your team?

Well that is very interesting, bees are trained to wander around ...

And as a result we are not always on time.

I once heard a very nice story about ...

Hon, these insects are not ridiculous enough already wasted valuable time?

How long we continue this comedy still take?

They do not have a certificate issued in their indictment ...

Against my clients, who all lawful businesses.

I also ask about this matter completely close.

Mr.. Flayman I am afraid that I have 't Mr. proposal. Montgomery needs to reflect.

You can not do that. We have a great thing.

Where it's evidence, where are the Evidence? Where is' t smoking weapon?

Honorable Halt! You want a smoking weapon, now here is your smoking weapon.

What's that? - This is a bijenbedwelmer.

What this? This harmless little device?

This still does not hurt a fly, let alone one.

Members of the jury, look what happened to bees that have never been asked: Smoking or non-smoking.

Is this what nature for us?

That we forced became addicted to this rookmachines ...

In the man-made wooden labor camps.

That we must lead our lives as honingslaven of the white man?

What are we going to do? - It performs' t call races.

Ladies and gentlemen, please liberated these bees.

Free bees!

The court decided in 't advantage of the bees.

Vanessa we have won.

I knew that you could. High-Five.

Excuse me.

I am fine. Vanessa you know what this means?

All honey is now up to the bees, now we no longer have to work so hard all the time.

This is a onheilige schenderij of the balance of nature, Benson ...

Get still regret.

Barry, how much honey you think that is? - Wait, one person at a time.

Barry, who do you? - My sweater is Ralf Lauren, and I have no pants.

What if Montgomery is just right? - What do you mean?

We live our lives a long time. 27 Million years.

Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to require, as a settlement?

First, we demand that all labor camps to be closed.

Then we all honey back, all of us who actually was.

Each drop!

We demand that we stop the glorification of the bear.

He is nothing more than a dirty, smelly, rotten, fat stinkmachine.

And we all know what they are in 't forest.

Wait for my character!

Explain to him.

He will be tired a few hours. Then everything returned to normal.

And we accept no more negative afgeleidde by nickname.

It is just a name.

Needless abuse of honey in so-called health products.

And that excessive garnish hassle, during the tea.

I get no air.

But let bags, boys.

If that goes well. - Goedzo.

Mr.. Buzzwell, we have passed the three heads ...

And it continues to come. We must clean up close.

Quit? We never close.

Close honey production. Stop honey.

Turn your keys, sir.

And what are we doing now?

Bomblet!

We put honey production halt. Mission canceled.

End of bestuiven and nectar detail. We are returning to the base.

Adam, you can not believe how many there are out there honey.

Oh yes? - What happens here?

Where is everybody?

Are they out to celebrate? - They are just part and do not know what to do.

They include free, and sleeping.

I have heard that your uncle Carl was on to San Antonio, for a jar of cricket.

We have at least our honey.

Sometimes I think, well, and that the people were nice and our honey.

Who thought that's not.

It is' t best in the whole world. I was proud to a part of 't process.

This was my new desk. This was my new job.

I would very much like my utmost.

And now ...

Now I can no longer exists.

I do not think they are not happy.

They have so many now, I thought that their lives would be better now.

They do nothing. Honey really change people.

You really have no idea what is going on, eh?

What you wanted me to see? - This!

What's happened here? - That's not all.

My God, no.

They are all verdord.

It does not seem to be best off, eh?

No.

And who do you think are wrong that is?

I believe the bees. - Bees?

In particular me.

I did not know that if no honey bees would make all those other things would affect.

It is not only flowers but also vegetables and fruit. They have all the bees.

There you have talked about our entire Cito button.

You take all the green path, it dies the entire animal kingdom, and that affects the ...

The human race.

There is no pollination.

It may thus all piece.

And I know that 't even a part my fault.

How about a suicide treaty? - How would you like 't do?

I push you, you get me.

That kills you twice. - Is.

Listen Barry. 'T Spijt me, but I must.

I had also once again my big mouth open.

Vanessa why go your way? Where are you going to go?

In 't final tournament of the pink parade in Passadena.

They have 't shifted to this weekend, because all the flowers death on the go.

It is the last chance that I will ever get, because to be seen.

Vanessa, I would say that 't regret me. This was never my intention.

I know I do. Me too.

Tournament of roses. Roses do not sport.

Wait a minute. Roses?

Roses!

Roses are flowers. - Yes, that is true.

Flowers, bees, pollen.

That, I know, that is why this is the last parade.

Maybe not. Can you ask whether he wants to drive slower?

Can you drive slower?

Okay, I have a very big mistake.

This is a total fiasco and it's all my fault.

Yes, actually yes.

I have destroyed the planet, and I wanted to help you with your bloemenzaak ...

But instead I 't worse. - It is in fact completely closed.

I thought you 't grow.

But that aside, I have a different idea, and that is much better than all the ideas together.

I do not want it heard.

Okay, I have this thought. They have the roses, and roses have 't pollen ...

And I know any information, plant, and flower in the region.

All that we need to do, what they have here to bring what we have.

Bees. Section. - Pollen. - Flowers. Flower - pollination.

Because of the whole nation.

Okay. 'T Tournament of roses. Passadena California.

They have only flowers, cars and candy.

There will be a lot of security. - I have an idea.

Vanessa Bloom, FTD.

Official bloemenzaken. Yes, it's real.

Sorry Mrs.

That is a beautiful brooch. - Thank you, it was a gift.

And if we once inside, then we deal with the right car.

What do you think of the Princess of peas? - Yes.

I can be the princess and you can peas. - I snap it.

Sorry, I am too late. Where do I sit? - Who are you?

I think I am peas.

The pea? That should be placed under the mattresses.

Not in this tale, dear. - I 't against the official said.

Do that. This whole parade is a fiasco.

Let's see what this thing can.

What are you doing?

Then we mix in traffic.

Without falling down.

And once the 't airport, then nobody more against us.

Stop security.

Do you have this car parked itself? - Yes.

Is this car all the whole time in your possession? - Yes.

Would you like your shoes uitdoen, and everything from your pockets Halen? Can your angel?

That is to me. - Can, I was even a joke.

Happy flight.

And then if we have luck, we have enough pollen get the job done.

Notice how much happiness we have, we have just enough get the job done.

I think that 't will succeed, Vanessa. - It must succeed.

Attention passagieren, this is Captain Scott ...

I am afraid we have bad weather around New York ...

And it looks to be that we have a few hours delay.

Barry these are flowers without water, save, it's gone.

I have to go talk to those guys. - Get cautious.

Can I get some help with this pool magazine?

I would like the talking self zwembadfilter order.

Sorry captain, but I sit in a difficult package.

What you said Halle? I said nothing.

Near! No-not flippen, there is a chance that my whole race ...

What do you do?

Are you crazy? I am a lawyer. - Who is a lawyer? - Do not move.

Good afternoon passagieren here speaks your captain.

Would Ms Vanessa Bloom Come to the cockpit? And shoots a little bit.

What's happened here?

I tried to talk with them but when ...

There was a kruimeldief, a lifeboat revenged themselves ...

Now there is a bald, one was already bald and they are both unconscious.

Is that a joke bees? - No, nobody flies' t phone.

This is the JFK control tower, flight 356 what is your status?

You speak with Vanessa Bloom, a florist from New York.

Where is the pilot? - That is unconscious, as the co-pilot.

Not good. Is there anyone on board who flying?

In fact, yes. - Who was that?

Barry Benson. - Of those honingzaak? No. anyway.

Vanessa this is nothing more than a metal with ...

It has huge wings, and large engines. - I can not control plane.

Is John Travolta is not even a pilot? - Yes.

How difficult can it be?

Wait again! Barry that we fly right to lightning.

This is Bob Bumbble, we have important news of 't JFK airport ...

Where a bizarre situation is developing.

Barry Benson who just finished with his great lawsuit, will now try to load an aircraft.

Filled with people, flowers, and a crew unconscious.

Flowers?

There is an electrical storm in the area ...

And there are two people who have control of a jumbo jet without any flying.

Wait a minute, there is a honingbij in that airplane.

I am familiar with the work of Mr.. Benson ...

Trivial and his comrades. Do they not have enough damage?

But he is not your only hope? - Come on, which would technically not allowed to fly.

Their wings are too small, in comparison to their body. - Wait a minute.

Have we not heard often enough?

That surface, the wings and lichaamsmassa stores nowhere.

Make sure you do films. - Is for each other.

Keep your ready. - We go live.

The way we work, is perhaps a riddle for you ..

Because honey to make, since you have a lot of bees.

These are all small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job.

If you do well, that makes a big difference.

More than we realized. For ourselves and everyone.

So let me also that bees are going to do what they 't best.

Collaborate. That is the method of the.

We are not made of pudding, we are our male. Black and yellow!

Left, right, down, up. - Up? Forget-up.

You know what. This is not so difficult.

Barry, what happened?

Wait again, I think we flew all the time already on automatic pilot.

That has helped me so. - And now no more.

I can not control plane.

Let's go help that guy. There on.

Our only chance is if you do what I do, and you me nadoet with the wings of 't phone.

You do not have to shout. - I do not cry. We just have a lot of problems here.

I can concentrate hard, which paniektoon in your voice.

It is no tone, but I am in panic.

I can not. - Vanessa raap you together and listen to me.

You must be quiet.

Will you agree but quiet. - You must be quiet.

You should do so quietly. - No, you should do so quietly.

Stop that. - Why? It's my turn.

How can 't plane fly again? - I do not know.

Hello? - He Benson, have you even flowers for a fine opportunity?

Stuifmeelberijders. - They are really behind their male.

Black and yellow.

Hello! Okay you two, what would you say if we look at 't throw black asphalt?

What black asphalt? I see nothing, do you?

No nothing. It is so cloudy.

Come on Barry, if you have a mind to.

Think like 'n.

Wait a minute, I think I feel something. - What?

I do not know, but it's strong and 't attracts me.

Like one 27 million years old instinct. Put the nose of the plane down.

Think as a!

What's going on hand on the runway? - Appearances the lights then!

Vanessa mik that flower. - Okay.

Turn the engine off. The engine-off?

We load on bijenkracht. Ready, guys?

Begrepen.

Quietly. So yes.

Land that flower. Ready guys?

In the reverse. - We turn to us.

Not the flour, but those other flower.

What flower? - Die flower!

I mik still on the flower. - That is Kaleknikker in his shirt flowers.

I mean that flashing flour, which is made from millions of bees.

Go forward, nose down. Run up the tail.

Turn around it.

This is gekkenwerk Barry. - This is the only way I know.

Am I crazy 't be, or fly this unit like it was an insect?

Put your nose in it. Do not be afraid. Ruik 't.

In his backwards, and put it down quietly.

Is there part of this.

Mik 't middle.

Bags!

Shoot once.

Barry 't is our successful. You have me learn to fly.

Yes! No high-five. - Okay.

Barry is successful, you saw that gigantic flower?

What gigantic flower? Where? Of course I have seen.

That was awesome man. - Thank you.

But we are not there yet.

Listen all, the runway is covered with flowers and the last 't last pollen.

That means that this is our last chance.

We are the only ones that make honey.

Flowers bestuiven, so dress.

If we want to survive as a race, this is our moment.

So how do you think? Are we all bees ...

Or keychain in 't museum of history.

We are bees!

Keychain.

Then follow me, except those keychain there.

Wait even Barry. Here you have earned this.

I am a stuifmeelberijder. It fits like a glove.

But what should I do with those sleeves?

That's our Barry.

Ma, the bees are back.

If you see someone should call, it seems "to me that he should do that now.

I believe that 't be late tonight.

Here is your change. And another fine day.

Do you have to have honey? It is approved by the bees.

Forget it.

Milk, cream, cheese, 't is all mine, but I see nothing in return.

Sometimes I feel like a piece of meat.

That was all I knew.

Sorry, you have even?

Excuseer me a while, my mug partner will provide further assistance.

Sorry, I am too late. - Is he a lawyer?

Madam, I was already a bloodsucker, I had only a aktekoffer needed.

Another fine day ahead.

But I can not. - No problem, but leave that to me.

Okay stuifmeelberijders, 't is time to go.

Thanks Barry.
