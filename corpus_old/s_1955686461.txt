Where were you during
lauds? Why did you miss lauds?

She got out last night,
and I had to find her.

Took me all morning.

She got out again?
Yeah.

Do you think she's
getting through the gate?

You think she could
get through the gate?

I should check the gates.

Or maybe she got
through the wall.

How would she get
through the wall, though?

I don't know. Why do you
care about the donkey so much?

Just doesn't make any sense.

Why are you wearing
your black habit? It's spring.

Because it was
dark when I left,

and it was the closest thing to me,
so I grabbed it. I finished my change.

Why are you asking me
so many questions?

Beautiful morning, sisters.

I told you to never talk to us,
you piece of shit! - How dare you, fuckers!

Get the fuck out of here!

<i> Blessed art thou, o Lord.</i>
<i> Teach me to know Thy will.</i>

By these lips, let the awards
thou makest ever be recorded.

Blithely, as one that has
found great possessions,

I follow thy decrees.

Bethinking me still
of the charge thou givest,

I will mark thy footsteps.

Be thy covenant
ever my delight,

thy words kept in memory.

Christ the lord was tempted
and suffered for us.

Come, let us adore him.

So, why weren't you at lauds
this morning?

Because the donkey escaped in
the woods, and I had to catch her.

The donkey escaped again?

Yeah. I think she
got through the gate.

She got through the gate.

All right. Well... - But I'll
make sure it doesn't happen again.

Okay, good.
I'll tell father Tommasso.

<i> What's going on</i>
<i> with sister Alessandra?</i>

She's been so out of it.

I don't know. Her dad's probably
visiting or something. - Again?

Yeah.
She's fucking delusional.

Yeah. She's so delusional.

She's pathetic.

Just because your dad
gives money to the convent,

doesn't mean you're gonna
get everything you want. - Yeah.

(?....) another day, and she was literally
just staring out the window

for, like, 10 minutes,
not moving.

Really?

She's probably, like,
daydreaming about some guy

that's gonna magically come
and take her away from here.

It's like, "good luck."

I know.

So, what was mother
Marea saying to you earlier?

Nothing. Mind your
own fucking business.

Okay.

But I'll do that, yeah.

I can sweep it
if you want me to.

For some reason,
it keeps getting unorganized,

and I'm not really sure
who's doing that.

Okay, yes, maybe
you could sweep the cellar,

because that's very dusty,
you know.

That's the cellar
and the altar.

because, for some reason,
it keeps getting all messed up,

and I'm not really
sure who's doing that.

But also, mother, there's
something else you should know. - Yes?

Last night at dinner. - Mmm- hmm.
I saw sister Latizia take two portions.

I don't know. Maybe you're not
counting, so maybe it doesn't matter.

Just in case you are,
it was sister Latizia.

I don't think you should be concerning
yourself with the amount somebody is eating.

We all require
different amounts of food.

I know that some days I need
more food, some days less...

So, watching me eat so carefully,
that would make me uncomfortable.

So I don't think you should be
bothering yourself with that.

Yes, mother.

Hi, dad.
Hi, sweetheart.

How are you, my angel?
I'm good. How are you?

I'm well. You look beautiful.

Thank you.

What I can make out.

You look terrific.
Are they feeding you?

Eh...

They should be feeding you,
for all the money we send them here.

But you look beautiful.
Thank you. Thank you. How's mom?

Mom is good. Mom is...
Everybody's well.

Good. The merchant Ricardo,
how's he?

Merchant Ricardo, uh, yes.
Glad you brought it up.

He's good.
Has he asked about me?

Sure. You bet he has.

Hmm.

I was hoping that we'd have
the whole dowry situation locked up,

and, um,
we're not there just yet.

They're asking
for a lot of money,

and, you know, with the
money we're sending here,

and then to your sisters
and their children, it's a...

There's a lot of money going
out and not that much coming in, so...

But maybe... if we sent less
money here to the convent,

we could save it up,

and I could even come
and live with you and mom and...

I don't think sending less
money here is a good idea,

because, uh, that would
reflect badly on the family.

But I know how eager you are
to be married, my baby.

I know, but maybe it's...
Maybe that's not your calling.

How's your embroidery
going? You still doing that?

Mmm- hmm.

Because you so good, and
maybe that's your calling, you know.

Some people, it's marriage and
family and the warmth of a home,

and maybe for you it's...
It's the detailed embroidery.

You know, keep... please.

Keep your chin up.

Give me...
Give me a little sugar.

Hey, hey, sweetie.

All right. Daddy loves you.

I love you.

Okay. All right,
you take care, and...

You don't... don't...
Don't you lose hope.

<i> The body of Christ.</i>

Amen.

The body of Christ.
Amen.

The body of Christ.
Amen.

The body of Christ.
Amen.

Are you all right?

The body of Christ.

So, sister Alessandra,
how was your father's visit?

Good.

Good?

Yes, it was good.

Any potential suitors?

That's not even
what his visit was about.

We didn't even talk about that.
Then what was his visit about?

Oh, my God. Hey, I told you
not to fucking look at us, you creep.

I'm sorry. I am... - Why are
you making eye contact with us?

Look at the ground,
you fucking pervert!

I'm sorry. - What is
this shit? - This is a turnip.

That's not a turnip!
It's shit!

You expect us to eat shit?
You're a piece of shit!

Yeah, you are a piece of shit.
You're disgusting! - I'm sorry.

Yeah, you are
a disgusting piece of shit!

Think we can just eat any of this food?
We're fucking starving! You can't do anything right!

Look at this wall!
Look at the stuff you build!

It's horrible,
you fucking imbecile!

What do you even do here?

Please, please.
Think you can talk to us?

You think you can look at us?

You know who my father is?

He pays you good money
to do nothing, you little rat!

You're a little fucking rat!

What is this, maggot food?

Just hoarding all the food,
huh, like a fucking Jew?

Is that what you're doing?
We're all starving!

You know what you did!

We hate you!
You deserve to die!

All right. Almost ready?
Tommasso, yes.

Almost ready.
Oh, look at this!

Isn't it beautiful?

That's gorgeous.
Who did that? - Sister Alessandra.

We have to make more
of that. That'll go big in town.

Tell Lurco to keep that garden gate
closed, because the deer are getting into it.

All right.

Are you ready for a journey?
Are you ready?

<i> "Know when the leaf</i>
<i> parts from the ash</i>

<i> "and the branches wizen</i>
<i> in the treetop</i>

"for through the bark the sweet
humor of the sap doesn't mount to them

"and the birds have fallen
silent from their warbling

"because of the cold

"But in spite of this all,

"It hasn't however kept

They're not good people.
No, Lurco...

No, I'm leaving.
The nuns, no. They spit on me.

Who spit on you?
They spit on me.

Lurco, I have to leave.

I'm about to leave to go to the
market to sell the fabrics, please!

Father, I'm very sorry,
I'm very sorry. They spit on me.

They called me a Jew.

They called me a Jew,
father Tommasso. - Lurco, please.

They called me a Jew.
Please.

Please, just wait two days!

<i> I want to think</i>
<i> we've had a nice life.</i>

<i> I think I surround you</i>
<i> in a lifestyle</i>

<i> that is pleasant</i>
<i> and luxurious.</i>

Enjoy this pheasant.

Soon as Florence gets here,

we'll be eating chicken like
a bunch of fucking Croatians.

I sent another messenger
to Florence. Messenger came back.

He's dealing
with the guelph soldiers.

He's got Florence.
He's got Arezzo.

He doesn't have Pisa yet,
but he will,

and then he's coming for us.
So, I sent a messenger to Arezzo.

He's not in Arezzo.

He's in Pisa.

He's going...
He's making a play for Pisa!

He doesn't have
Pisa yet, but he will.

They're weak,
like the guelphs.

You know what comes
after Pisa? Lucca.

He's coming
for our silk trade.

So, my dear,

enjoy this lavish lifestyle,
your two dresses,

your pheasant, your lentils.
Live it up.

This... this Florentine
conspiracy thing, I got the point

he talks about it so much,
it's like a mental illness.

I'll be fake sleeping... - Mmm- hmm.
...and he's still going on about it.

"We're gonna lose everything."
Mmm- hmm.

"you know what? I hope we do,
just so you'll shut up."

Just shut up.
Mmm- hmm.

He thinks that everything
that happens is because of them.

He thinks on lot of things.

He's just... Just, it's not...
Even his tone is awful.

Yeah? You act like I don't suffer
through it, too. I'm right there with you.

That sounded like him.

Hmm? - That sounded like
him. - No, no, that's not him.

He's always asleep.
Just relax.

You're so cute.

I felt like... I felt I
heard the... - No, no.

All right, we're gonna
fuck again. That'll help you relax.

No! That is him.

No! That's... that is him.

Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

What have you done?
Oh, what have I done?

Oh, what's out there?
Is it the guelphs?

Is it Florence? Are they
coming? - Go get 'em!

I shall deal with you shortly.

I'm petrified.

Now I'll know who
you are in the morning.

We'll settle this in private.

I'll tell you
what happened, 100%.

A demon came in here while
we were sleeping and cut our hair.

There's no way to prove it's not a demon,
so... - Which means that it was a demon.

What else was it?
A warlock?

Good morning.

My liege.

You common-born dogs.

One of you sluts thinks
he's quite the Jester.

What the fuck
are you looking at?

I'll fuck you
where you breathe.

What was that all about, huh?

I saw guelph men
rush into town...

Savage beasts,
tearing men from limb to limb.

I saw a little boy's head
crushed between a...

A man's boot and...
And a stone.

His eyeballs
came skittering across.

I saw my beautiful
eight-year-old sister, Benicia,

cleaved in half with one
swipe of a sword by the guelphs.

She was more beautifully
developed as a woman than you are today.

You see this copper
in my hair?

She had the most beautiful
hair of this color all over her body.

Shut up. Stop talking.
On this table

no more eyeballs or squishing
and all that kind of stuff.

I don't want to hear about
any more violence at the table,

'cause I'm eating, and I'm
digesting, so stop it. - Silence!

How dare you?

You are weak.

I've begun to suspect you have
guelph blood coursing through your veins.

Oh, no. How
did you find out?

I will bring the devil's goad
to your bedchamber this evening,

and it will be
freshly polished. - No.

We're not doing that anymore.
You're not putting anything in there.

Nothing's coming out, nothing.
We'll see about that.

I'm not doing that anymore.

I need a refill.
Don't.

Oh.
Please don't do this.

I just need a quick
little refill. Come here.

You've been so sweet to me.
Stop, stop. Somebody's gonna catch us!

Look, look, you're gonna
get me fuckin' killed! - Uh- huh.

If someone catches me...

I don't want to hurt you!
I don't want to hurt you!

It's like, why are there
so many folds in here?

Shit. Oh, shit.

Bring me his goddamn balls.

Shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

God dang it! Your twigs
are all over the place.

Keeping up?
You keeping up?

Just go without me!
Go without you?

I'll get there.

Masseto, let's talk about this!

Just stop! Stop!

Masseto, come on!

Masseto, come on!

No running!
Masseto!

Masseto!

Oh, no!

Oh, no!

No.

Father?

You stay away! These are mine!

No, it just looks like you...
You stay away! They're mine!

Hey, stop! Stop! I'm just trying to
help you! - If you're a bandit,I will strike you!

You can either lose all
of your stuff,

or you can trust me
and let me help you!

I was entrusted to take care
of these things, and I've ruined this!

The sisters made all these things,
and I've lost them in the water. - It's all right.

And now I've fallen...
It's all right. I'm gonna help.

Are you all right?

I'm drunk!

And I have fallen
with my cart,

and this animal went
the wrong way.

All right, all right, all
right, all right, just stay down.

Stay down, please.

There. That's it.
All right.

I wish there was something
i could give you in repayment.

I have no money. Or wine...
No, father, I don't need any money, or wine.

That's... that's totally fine.
Yeah.

Are you sure there's nothing
i can do to repay you?

I don't know. If you maybe
had a place for me to stay tonight,

I would really appreciate it.
You have nowhere to stay?

No.

Oh, you're coming with me.

It was a total disaster.

I never should have stopped to
speak to Lurco. That's what's held me up.

And then I was out at night.

I had to drink the wine,
because I had no water.

And then I just didn't realize
how drunk I was getting,

and I've lost everything!
I'm sorry, father.

I wish there was more I could
have done. - How am I gonna explain?

No, no, it's all right.
You've done... You've done a lot.

Right, here you are.
Fresh bread for you.

Oh, careful. Go...
Take it easy.

It's really, really good.

Good, good. I'm...
I'm sorry I was so...

Excited and upset before. I...

That's all right. That's...

Would you like some wine?

Bottom up. Up.

Up! Uh- uh...

I didn't touch it.

This has been wonderful.

Too wonderful.

The best blessing I have ever
experienced. - You saved me!

You saved me! Are you kidding?

I'm not kidding.

I didn't save you.

I couldn't put it... The wheel
of the donkey cart back on.

Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

It has been years,

many years
since my last confession.

Hmm.
Here are my sins.

I have slept
with another man's wife.

He's a nobleman,
and he is my master.

Well, that's adultery.

I know.
It's a very serious sin.

Sometimes...

She would place her
mouth around my sex.

Well, that's sodomy.

It's also a serious sin.

Is it also considered
sodomy if...

If I placed my mouth
on her sex while...

She simultaneously had...
Had her mouth around mine?

Why would you do that?

Because she... she liked it.

Oh.

Well, yes, that's also sodomy.

I thought sodomy was...
Was just when I would...

When someone would
penetrate the rear... the rear end.

Yes, that's...
That's also sodomy.

That's the traditional
form of sodomy. - Right.

Did you do that?

I... I did. Yes, I...
That also occurred.

But you didn't spill
your seed in the rear end?

No, no, I did not.

Good, good.

I would spill my seed
on her... um...

On her back or on her bosom.

But most of the time,
she would request

that I spill my seed
all over her face.

Well...

These are serious sins.

And do you regret doing these things?
I've learned my lesson, I really have.

And I just... I don't want
to be that person anymore.

If I go back out on the road,
they will catch me, and they will kill me.

Well, I'll give you
your penance.

I want you to say
10 Hail Marys... - Yeah.

...and 15 our fathers.
Yes.

Now, as to the other situation

about you being pursued,

I think I may have a solution

that can be a blessing
to both of us.

Yes, thank you, father.
Thank you.

Good morning, Marea.
Good morning.

Is it a good time?
Yes.

I'd like to introduce you
to someone. This is Masseto.

He's a deaf-mute.
Oh.

I met him on my trip
and spoke to his family,

and they explained to me that he's
very good with gardening, light carpentry.

I think he could help us
repair the cloister

and do all of the things
that Lurco was doing.

And I thought the fact
that he's a deaf-mute,

there would be a lot less
conflicts with the sisters.

I can't believe you met
a deaf-mute on your trip.

How was your trip?
Did you sell any fabrics?

We should talk
about it in private.

But you said
he was a deaf-mute.

Right. Um...

I was robbed.
Were you hurt?

No, no, I'm fine. I wasn't hurt,
but the bandits took everything.

They took all the embroidery,
all of the silk,

I've come back empty- handed.
I'm sorry.

What can I say?
I'm very embarrassed, but...

All right. Don't worry too
much about it. I'll get him started.

We go. We go.

Hi.

Who are you?

I'm sister Ginevra.

What are you doing?

You're digging a ditch?

You're digging a ditch.

All right.

<i> Since God is perfect,</i>

it's our job to live in
unison with his essence.

But sometimes it's difficult to find
that happiness and things don't go our way.

And we feel like we're
being punished, and it's not...

Thank you, sister Fernanda.
Thank you. - Of course.

Um...

But God...
God is... is perfect.

Fernanda! That's enough!

What?
 This is...

Viola, go inside
and finish your reading.

Stop it! Stop that!

What are you doing?

I said stop that!
That is enough!

What's gotten into you today?
Nothing. I'm so sorry.

You know what? I'll just go
scoop some dung or scrub the cellars...

I don't know where
this is coming from!

...and not bother you
while you walk in...

Did he just smile at you?

I don't know. - Why is he
smiling? Who is that? Wait!

Who the fuck are you?

Who are you?

Who are you?
Fernanda, stop!

He's an intruder. I don't
know who the fuck he is!

Let me get mother Marea!
Fine! Go!

Tell me who you are.

What? Say something!

Where did you come from?
What is that?

What are you doing
with your hands?

What? What, are you hungry?

What is that, a bird?
You're praying?

What the fuck are you
saying to me?

Fucking tell me who you are!

Don't chop his head off!

He's Masseto! He's a deaf-mute!
He works for us! Father Tommasso hired him.

I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about it.

You're always complaining
about how Lurco talks to you,

and Masseto doesn't talk.

So, I would really like you
to give him a chance.

Please!

All right.

And, sister, I need
to speak to you.

You can get up now!

He can't hear you.

Why are you defending him?

Now!

Father Tommasso was attacked
by a group of bandits, and...

No.
He...

Well, all the embroidery
was stolen.

So everything I've done,
everything I've worked on, is gone?

Yes, I'm afraid
that's what happened.

Are you all right?

Yeah.

It's...

I know this is a lot to...

To swallow.

I'd be more than
happy to get you

extra help for the work,
which will be doubled

to make up for everything
that was lost.

Hello?

Hi.

Um, I broke this.

Can you...

Fix this, yes?

You've... really kind eyes.

Sorry to just
spring this on you.

It's only 'cause they
just sprang it on me.

You know, they just
asked me to double production

of my embroidery
out of nowhere.

And I'm basically doing it alone. They
told me that they would give me help,

and then they just stuck me
with this...

This, like, shriveled up, old,
comatose woman.

And, you know,
I look at her, and I just...

I see me. That's
what I'm gonna become.

I'm just gonna
waste away here.

This is not what I
imagined for myself, you know.

What are you doing?

Why are you hiding in
the weeds like an animal?

I just saw sister Alessandra
go into the toolshed.

But I know he is not saving up
money for merchant Ricardo.

This is like...
It's not even his fault.

There's just no hope
anywhere in the world.

It's so sad and depressing.

There's no hope for
any of us. Yes, look at you.

Look at you. You can't speak.
You can't hear. It's not fair!

You're just stuck here
with all these bitches,

and so am I!

I just don't even
know what to do!

It's so unfair.

What the fuck
is she doing in there?

I have no idea.

Let us pray.

Lord, give our
bodies restful sleep

and let our work we have done
today be sown for an eternal harvest

through Christ, our Lord.

Amen.

Lord, Grant us a quiet night
and a perfect end. Amen.

Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

It has been three days
since my last confession.

And what is it
you would like to confess?

Yesterday, I walked by the garden,
and I picked a turnip and I ate the whole thing,

and I didn't share it
with my sisters.

Hmm,
and you regret this?

Yes, father.

Because it was greedy, wasn't it?
It was, father. - Hmm.

Anything else?

Yes, father.

I've been having
impure thoughts.

Hmm.

And have you acted
on these thoughts?

No, father.

Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

It's been two days
since my last confession.

And what do you
wish to confess?

The other day, I found
a turnip in the garden

and I ate it all by myself,

and I didn't share it
with my sisters.

And it was so delicious...
 Sister.

Ginevra just told me
the same story.

Did you overhear
her confession?

No.

Fine.

Do you have
anything else to confess?

No. I have
nothing else to confess.

Well, you missed lauds,
sister. That's something.

Well, that's because the donkey
escaped in the woods, and I saved her.

You should be
thanking me, father.

Look,
I'm just gonna...

I don't know what
to do here.

If you don't confess,
God can't forgive you, so...

I have nothing
to confess. - All right.

Well, just go and think
about what you've done.

Let's try it again
next week. - Yes, father.

First day.

First day. Thank you.

You survived.

Mmm- hmm.
How is going on?

Yeah, no... All the work
itself, it went really smoothly.

And I did a lot of
great work in the cloister,

and that was good.

And I met a few of the...
The sisters, and they were...

They were... they were,
you know, very interesting.

And just grateful...
Grateful to be here, so...

These girls can be
tough. I'm not gonna lie.

They can be very tough.
Really? - And violent.

Violence? I...

Wow, I just... I find
that so hard to believe.

They were...
They were so lovely.

They physically
have attacked people.

So, if anything
happens, just tell me.

Whatever it is, I can fix it,
but you have to tell me.

I mean, this deaf-mute thing
is there to protect you...

Exactly.

...and to keep the
sisters away from you.

'Cause they can have
a pack mentality.

Ultimately, this is gonna be
a very positive influence.

Living ethically every
day, serving God.

It's really gonna
fortify your soul.

Yeah, you're right.
I think I can learn a lot

by watching the sisters
and everyone around,

who seem very ethical
and, yeah. - Cheers.

Actually, I was
gonna ask you, is it...

Is it all right that we keep
drinking the sacramental wine?

Well, I blessed it, so...

You blessed it, so it's...
I mean,

don't mention it
to anyone else, but...

How could I?
I'm deaf and mute, remember?

Hi.
Hi.

You're not going
to bed, are you?

No.

Do you have anything to drink?

What do you want?

Father Tommasso
left the ambry unlocked.

Hi. I'm Marta.

She's my childhood friend.

Yeah, yeah, childhood friend.
 We grew up together.

Are you drunk?

No. And...

Then you should have more.

Your room's gorgeous.

Yeah.
My dad got it for me.

Why is it so big?
It's a lot bigger than your room.

Is it?

I've never been in your room.

Yes, you have.

No.

Don't laugh.

What are you doing?

I can't sleep! You're
too loud! - Get outta here!

Get the fuck in here!
What are you doing here?

Shut the fuck up.
What are you doing?

Who... who are you?

Hi.
That's Marta. - I'm Marta.

You have an accent. Where
are you from? The south?

Oh, my God.
Are you from Umbria?

No. What's she talking about?
I sound just like you. - No. She's from here.

You're not from Gartagnana. -  Yes, she is.
You do not sound like you're from Gartagnana.

Are you drinking
the sacramental wine?

No. Father Tommasso drinks it all
the time. - I'm gonna tell mother Marea.

Why are you always
telling on people?

Yeah, shut up.
Just drink a little bit of it.

Sister Alessandra wants you
to drink. - Ginevra, it's fine.

Nothing matters in life.
We're all gonna die.

Terrible things are
happening all the time.

You're not allowed
to have visitors here.

You're not allowed... - Just enjoy
this moment... We're all gonna die.

And just drink a little wine.

But we're not gonna get
in trouble? - Do it. - Do it.

Whoo!

Oh, that tastes bad.
That's bad.

I think there was sand in it.

Is it true
that you've never...

Been touched by a man,
or touched a man?

No.

Never?

I feel sad for you. Do you
ever wonder what it's like?

Why? Is it really so great?

It's the greatest
pleasure on earth.

Really?
Mmm.

Mmm.

Oh, my God,
you have no idea.

In fact, it's so good
that I've heard of women

who make this potion
out of this plant belladonna

just to seduce men.

We can't do it,
'cause we would get locked up.

Yeah, it's a mortal sin.
We wouldn't get into heaven.

It's a mortal sin.

Yeah, then you
probably shouldn't do it.

Probably shouldn't do it.

Doesn't really matter, anyway,
'cause we're never gonna know that.

Nothing matters.

Are you really
from Gartagnana?

Yeah. I am.
Mmm- hmm.

Hi, little one.

I don't feel well.

I don't feel well. - Yeah, it's
'cause this is too tight. - No...

Yeah, let's just...

I should go. I should go.

Okay. No, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry! But what is...

Oh, no, it's my room.

This is my room.
Yeah, it's your room.

I'm sorry. - It's okay.
I'm sorry. I don't...

Hi. Um...

Hi.

Hi.

I made this for you.

For you, yes.
Let me show you.

You can, um, sort of...

It says thank you, just for...

Just letting me talk
to you the other day.

I talk so crazy, I know.

I mean, you know,
you can't, you know, hear me.

Do you need help?
Do you need help?

I just...

Okay. Is that help for you?

Yeah.
Is that how you do it?

Okay. Okay.

Oh, I'm so dirty.

It's so warm.

It's so hot out here.

Just have to...

Oh...

That's better.

Sorry.

Sorry.

You're right. You're right.

That's too fast.

That's too fast.
We should stop.

Sorry.

Sorry. I'm sorry.

Okay.

Bye.

Glory to god in the highest,

and on earth,
peace to people of good will.

We praise you.
We bless you.

We adore you.
We glorify you.

We give you thanks for
your great glory, Lord God.

Heavenly king, o God,
almighty father...

Last night was nice.

Are you tired?
Yeah.

Yeah, me too.

You feel okay?
No, I don't feel good.

I hade fun. - I said I don't feel
good. Can you please stop talking?

Well, okay.

Hi, ladies.
What are you doing here?

Um, I was just
in the neighborhood.

What?
I'm kidding.

No, my veil just got
a little dirty,

and I knew you girls
were here,

and I thought I'd come visit

and wash it with you guys.

You're gonna wash
your own veil?

Yeah. Why not?
You never wash anything.

Wasn't last night so fun?
How'd your veil get so dirty?

Um...

Well, earlier I was
in the garden,

and the new handyman
was there digging a ditch,

and I just thought
I'd help him out.

Digging a ditch? - It was
actually... It was really fun.

So, what do I do?

Do I just dip it in the...
In the water?

It's so... ooh, it's...

It's really dirty over here.

First you put it in the water, and then...
you bring it over to the bowl that has the ash.

And you put it in the bowl,
and you put the ash on top of it,

and then you let it sit for a day.
So then tomorrow, you would come back

and take it out of the bowl, and
then you rinse it really well in the water...

And then you wring it out,
and then you hang it up on the line.

Sounds like you are
really good at this...

So, maybe I'll just...
I'll leave it here with you.

This was great.

Thank you. Bye,
you guys. - Bye.

Guess I would have ended
up washing this eventually.

Here. Finish this.

I have to go
tidy up the cellar.

Here it is.

Yeah, there should
be enough here.

Sister Fernanda?

Just have to remember not to
get this in your mouth, okay?

I know.

Take off the nun thing.

You'll get it all over it.

Okay, you ready?
 Yeah.

All right.

Go for it.

Just going to...

Make you look a little more...

Presentable.

Do exactly
what I tell you to do.

Make sure he sees your eyes.

Okay, kiss him.

Kiss him.

Come on.

Okay, get closer.
Careful with the knife.

Take it all in.

Okay.

Get on top of him.

Push your sex
into his stomach.

All right.

He'll do.

What were you
doing in there? - Hi.

Where'd you come from?

I was just picking
root vegetables.

Are you really
from Gartagnana?

Yes, I'm really
from Gartagnana.

Why do you keep asking me?

You've asked me, like, 25...
You are the most annoying!

Are you ignoring me?

No.

I feel like you're
ignoring me. - I'm not.

Can I ask you a question?

Yes.

Did last night
mean anything to you?

No.

We were just
drunk and having fun.

Forget about it.

All right.

Masseto, Masseto, Masseto.

I'm actually...

I'm all right right now.

Oh, all right.

Yeah.

How's it going?

It was a good day.

Yeah, I um...

I don't know. I can kind of...

I can kind of picture myself
maybe being here a while.

Really? You think
you could stay on?

If you'd have me, yeah.

Are you kidding?

That would solve
a lot of problems.

And how's it going with
the sisters? That's all right?

I think they're
kind of warming up to me.

Good. Good, good.
Not too much?

No. Definitely...

Definitely not too much.

It's the right amount,
feels like.

Anyway, let's have a toast,

just a quick toast...

And then maybe head over
to confession. Like we allways do.

I think I'm good tonight, just
'cause I'm gonna... Feeling a little tired.

It's been a long day.
All right, yeah.

It's bad luck to put it
back in the pitcher, though...

So, let's just
have this one, and then...

Hello?

Are you alone?

Of course. - I thought I heard someone.
No, no, no. I was talking to myself.

Let's take a little walk.

Bishop Bartolomeo, hello.
Father Tommasso.

Ah, it's good to see you.
Thank you. - Come in.

Come in. Come in.
Hello.

Here. Let me take this.
You must be exhausted.

Very tired, very long trip.

So good to see you.
So good to see you, too.

Somewhat unexpected.

Looks great.

We'll get it together for you.
Oh, yes, I'm sure you will.

Oh, shit!

Knock- knock.
Are they not here?

They disappeared.
 Oh.

And you know Alessandra, Ilario's
daughter? - Ilario's daughter, of course.

Hi. - His business is not doing very
well at the moment. - Oh, that's terrible.

Sorry to say, yeah.
Yeah. - I want one of those.

We can get you one.
Yes, it's yours. It's yours.

Thank you, sister Alessandra.
 Thank you. - I'll see you.

We appreciate your time.

And we all
went out to the field

and worked on a single plot.

I see your point, but
I'd like you to focus here.

No, but I'm fine with March.

In February, how did you
sell textiles before they were sold?

I like what you're saying,
and if you...

No. But this is March.
I'm fine with March.

Mother Marea, I need to talk
to you about sister Fernanda.

Is she all right? - Well,
she's acting very suspicious.

And I've learned some things
i think you'd want to know.

You know how she's been saying
that the donkey escaped?

It's not escaping.
Okay, this is not the right time.

She's lying about it.
You'll want to know about it.

I'm so sorry about that. - Have
you seen these numbers? Who...

I supervise in general...

The numbers, but...

Sister, I'm asking, please keep
your voice down. - She wasn't there!

She was clearly lying.
She had a friend over,

She's staying up! I hear her
up all night. - Don't talk so much...

She's clearly lying about
the donkey escaping.

I don't know why she's lying,
but I checked the walls,

I think that donkey needs
someone else to take care of her.

I can take care of her.

I will consider it.

Thank you, mother.
We'll discuss this later.

Isn't that amazing, sisters?

That rose had the ability

to predict the exact day
of the death of Frederick II.

I think we all have this
ability to connect deeply with God.

I share the story, because
we don't always listen to God.

Hey!

What's going on?

You can speak?

No, no. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

I heard you. I heard you!

Or I'm gonna tell everyone
here that you've been tricking us!

All right, all right,
all right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm not supposed to
talk to you.

You're not supposed to
talk to me?

What does that even mean?

Hello? Hello?

Get down. Get down.
 Can you hear me?

Can you
hear me? Hello?

No,
you can't hear me.

Can you hear my thoughts?

'Cause I can
hear your thoughts.

I can hear your thoughts.

Hi.

This feels different.

I think I like sex with girls.

I never told anyone.

I have lots
of secrets. I'm Jewish.

Nobody knows,
but now you know.

But you don't know,
'cause you can't...

There's the angels.
Do you see the angels?

I see the...
Oh, I hear 'em. I hear 'em.

Oh, they know. They know
I'm here. They know I'm here.

Oh, God. Okay.

What are you doing here?

I'm just looking
through the hay. - Shh!

Fernanda! What the
fuck is wrong with you?

Why is there blood
all over your face?

Get out of my way!

Fernanda? Fernanda?

Over there. Come on.
They have the donkey.

Oh, jeez.
Are you okay?

Are you okay?

I'm gonna throw up.
Okay, okay, okay. Let it out.

I'm not gonna
throw up. - Okay, okay.

Let's keep moving.
We're gonna keep going.

Keep going.
I'm so hot. Why am I so hot?

I don't know.
 Oh, I'm so thirsty.

Gotta keep going.

What is the lights?
Look at the lights.

What is it...

I took the belladonna.
I took the belladonna. - What?

She had it. She had the sex,
and so I was gonna have the sex.

So I did belladonna
so I could have the sex...

Witches.

They're witches!

He's making a lot of noise.

It's okay. He's a deaf-mute.
Yeah, well, maybe we should gag him.

There's no point.
He can't talk.

Shut up.

Ginevra, no.

Ginevra, come back here.

Ginevra, get back here!

Stop!

For so it was placed
when the goddess embraced.

The horned Lord, our God
who taught her the word.

Which quickened the
womb and conquered the tomb.

Lance to grail,
spirit to flesh,

sun to moon.

Forever your flame
is the male.

Don't fucking kill me.
No, don't, please.

We cured him.
There's absolutely no way.

You know nothing.
This is a fertility ritual.

It'll be great
if you just listen next time.

Okay.

What are you
all looking at?

Why are you
looking at me?

What is she doing here?

What?

Ginevra!

Calm down.
Put the totem down!

You do not belong here!

Give it to me.
You don't belong here!

No, no.
You don't belong!

Spirit to flesh,
sun to moon.

Quiet.

Fernanda! Stop this!

God, what are you doing here?

Stop it, Alessandra!
I need to have sex with him!

Why are you...
Why are you even here?

You don't know
the powers of...

You're a witch? This is crazy!

And you were lying
to us this whole time?

Yes, explain yourself!
All right, all right, all right.

These people, they want
to kill me, and I went on the run...

This is my donkey!

We have to get her.
 She's out of control.

All right, let's... - Enough
with the knife already.

That fucking bitch.

You need to know
what's going on!

You need to know!

Wake up!

Wake up! Wake up!

You need to know
what's going on!

What are you doing? It's the
middle of the night! - They're witches!

They're witches!

You need to know
about the witches!

Put your clothes on. - Fernanda's
a witch, her friend's a witch!

Calm down! - They're all out there! Father
Bartolomeo, you need to know. There are witches...

She's a witch!
She is a witch!

I am not a witch!
 Stop!

You're just jealous.
No, I am not!

Why are you wearing
your winter habit?

I saw him first.
Why is the handyman here?

What do you mean, you saw him
first? You don't even like men!

You're sexually attracted to
women. - I am sexually attracted to men.

What?
I had sex with him!

You are a bride of Christ!
You did not have sex with him.

You were just
writhing around on him.

How dare you? Bishop, I did
not have sex. - I'm telling the truth.

I know what you're doing
and she's my donkey now!

Don't talk about my donkey.

I am on donkey duty now!
What is wrong with her?

She is on drugs!

She told me
she took belladonna tonight,

and she's been dancing around
naked in the woods with witches.

And she's a Jew!

I am not a Jew!
Sister Marea!

Stop talking.

I am not a Jew! - Yes!
Stop. Stop. Sister Marea!

Sister Marea! Wake up!

I'm not a Jew.
I'm not a Jew.

Come out here.
Look at this. - I was sleeping!

Complete chaos!
I'm sorry.

Everyone's awake.
What's on your face?

It's the middle of the night.
There's a donkey downstairs.

Why do you have
pants on your head?

Okay, just please stop!

I can explain everything,
all right? It's all my fault.

I thought you couldn't speak!

Yeah, he can talk. - I thought
you were a deaf-mute!

It's a miracle.

We're going to
begin the tribunal.

Sister Ginevra,
these are your sins.

Ingestion of drugs,

lying with a woman,

not being baptized.

Not being baptized?

That's what
makes you what you are.

You can't... you shouldn't even
be coming through those doors!

Being a busybody,
filthy conversation...

Vain jangling, drinking...

Eating blood.

Do you think I've ever written
down "eating blood" before?

Where am I?

Envy, fornication,
homosexuality...

That's the same as lying with
a woman, but we separate those.

Lustfulness, reveling,
mischief in your heart.

That's the longest list
I've ever had... for sins.

Please have mercy on me.

For your punishment,

I'm going to have you
fast for one year.

Okay. - I didn't explain it
yet, so it's not okay. - Okay.

Because a human being
can't live on not eating.

No. - I don't mean you're
not gonna eat for a whole year.

You just pick a meal
in the day

and skip it.
Okay.

So, say, it's lunch. Every day,
you've got to skip lunch.

Yes.
And what meal is that?

Uh...

Based on your
suggestion, I'll skip lunch.

It's not my suggestion.

You have to feel the sin.
I can feel lunch.

Sister Alessandra.

You know...

I'm friends with your father,

and now his daughter
is doing this?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. - It's embarrassing.

For me, I'm embarrassed.

How do you think he's
gonna feel when he knows this?

There's no need to tell my father.
He's a patron of the church,

one of the biggest.

And this place is completely
in disrepair. It's falling apart.

It looks like a barn
in filicaia.

Have you been there?

It's disgusting.
It's disgusting!

Please, please don't say that.

I think I want to call this place
little filicaia. - No, please. -  I might.

Sister Fernanda,
these are your sins.

Apostasy,

heresy,

abusive language... - It's
just the tone of my voice.

Homosexuality...

Revelings, witchcraft.

Did you roll
your eyes? - No.

You were rolling your eyes.

Sister Marea,
i don't know what to say.

I am shocked.

Fornication?
Living in pleasure?

You, sister Marea, you.

Loving the world?

Why don't
you just stay here?

Why don't you stay in this
world that you love so much?

Isn't it fun?

Do you have
anything to say?

I'm so sorry, your holiness.

Do you care?

It's just complete lack of...
Are you guys smiling at each other?

Can you have a moment
to not look at each other?

You're both out of control.

Father Tommasso...

I don't even know
where to begin.

I ask your forgiveness...

And I ask God's forgiveness

for failing as the
Shepherd of this flock.

I only ask that you please not punish
the sisters of this convent for my failings.

Marea.

I'm so sorry.

He's taken
away my priesthood.

I have to go to San
Biagio and become a monk.

I'm so sorry
for dragging you into this.

You're a good woman.
You're a good woman, Marea.

I should... - What the
hell are you doing?

Get outta here!

You were just
crying in there?

What's wrong with you?

Was lying
with Francesca worth it?

I really don't
want to talk about it.

What about that bosom?
Very ample.

Super ample,
plus it's Bruno's wife,

so it had to be so intense.

Can you guys
please stop talking?

You heard what
happened to her, right?

No.
How could I have heard?

"At the end
of the cold season,

"when along the branch

"surges the sap that revives
the broom and Heather.

"When the peach trees blossom
and the frog sings in the pool

<i> "and the Willow</i>
<i> and elder grow,</i>

<i>"as I see the
dry months come,</i>

<i> "i concern myself</i>
<i> with a large orchard</i>

<i> "where there are beautiful</i>
<i> saplings in many places.</i>

<i> "The grafts are large,</i>
<i> and the fruit fleshy</i>

<i> "on those that should</i>
<i> be the worst.</i>

<i> "And the blossoms</i>
<i> look like those of apples."</i>

<i> "But when the fruit comes,</i>

<i> "it is nothing but</i>
<i> Willow and elder.</i>

<i>"And since the head is empty,</i>
<i> the members at the ends are in pain."</i>

Did you finish
cleaning the cellar?

Yeah, all done.

Isn't it so annoying?

So annoying.
I told you.

I know.

Sorry I told on you.

Sorry that I told mother
Marea every time I thought

something wasn't
right or weird.

Sorry I ruined your ritual.

I'm sorry I didn't
tell you I was a witch.

But honestly,

I thought eventually I could
turn you all into witches,

and you'd join my coven,
but I know that sounds stupid.

You really think
i could be a witch?

Yeah.

Do you think
they're gonna kill him?

I don't know what's
going on with Giovanni lately.

Have you noticed the carrots
they're serving the soldiers are mushier?

I was saying
the same thing yesterday.

I would even be okay if
they were mushy on the outside

and crispy on the inside.
I don't need, like, a full crisp, but...

It could be a little mushy.

I'm fine with a little mush.
'Cause this is basically carrot pudding.

Where is he?

Welcome back.

I'm sorry to keep you
waiting. I've been in Sarzana

meeting with the
family of my new bride.

Beautiful young lady who seems
like she might be up to fidelity.

Imagine that.

Once she hits puberty.

I have to thank you for
doing me an incredible favor.

My wife, who had hidden her
guelph ancestry, turned out to be

quite the barren twat.

And you've given me
every reason

to seal her up in a wall
with a boar and a dog.

I've got some good news

and some bad news.

Which would you like first?

The good news is I'm going to
keep you alive for as long as I can.

It sounds cheery.
The bad news is

it's only so that
i can inflict as much pain

and degradation
as I torture your flesh.

I'm having
a hard time determining

which of my favorite
torture methods

to start with upon you.

Got the thumbscrew.
I have a Catherine wheel.

I have a rack out back.

It was taking up
too much space in here,

but still fully functional.

There's a new one called
the rat box just in from Sicily.

The rat box,
not to be confused with

what I call
my wife's private area

after you'd been to visit.

It's a box of rats
with one open side

placed against your abdomen.

I light a fire on
the other side of the box,

so that the rats,
in their attempts to escape,

burrow through your guts.

Anyway, we'll have
a lot of fun together

in the coming days
and maybe weeks,

depending on
how tough you are.

Don't go anywhere.

Shit.

There was no good
news in that at all.

Hey, um... I'd actually...

I'd really appreciate it if
you guys let me out now. - Oh.

Can't do that to us.

Please.
It's a tough position.

Hey, hey,
we're friends, all right?

You don't want
to be here either.

Just let me out.
We'll make a run for it.

I...
We can't.

He can't make a run
for anything.

If I die, that's
on your conscience.

You don't want to
live with that. Please.

What... is...

Okay. You're gonna have
to move quick,

especially around the moat.

The guards out there
have a real thirst for blood.

Yes, of course.
Thank you so much.

Okay, here I go.
Okay.

I'm unlocking you.

What are you...

There's a turtle with
a candle on it! - Really?

Wait, wait, wait!
Don't leave me!

Hey, where are you
going? Don't leave me!

Come on! Just please.
Stop, you shits!

Let's see what
he does. - Shit.

What are you doing here?
We're getting you out. Hi.

Come on!

Come on. Come on.

Whoa, whoa. Come on!

No, no, it's okay.
I'm giving it to you.

You can trust us.

We're rescuing you!

I embroidered this doll
to put in your place.

We brought you a lunar
habit to hide you in the night.

We want to bring
you back to the convent.

All right.

All right, let's go.

I'm gonna need that back.

Put on the habit.
Key. Oh, key!

Okay. All right.

Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

You think this has something
to do with our hair being cut?

You think we should
tell Bruno about that?

He's got his hands full with
the wife in the wall and everything.

We just saw
the wildest thing.

You would not believe it.

Well, it was a turtle...

Come on.

Hello.
Tommasso.

How are things
at the convent?

It's lonely.

That monastery is so boring.

All we do is pray.

I mean, it's important, but...

It's all men.

It's so good
to see your face.

Someone's coming.

Come on!

Come on.

They're gone.

All right, come on.
