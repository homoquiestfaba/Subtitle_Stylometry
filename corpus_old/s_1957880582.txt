<i>Now, when people</i>
<i>think of New Jersey,</i>
<i>they think of North Jersey.</i>

<i>The highways, the cities,</i>
<i>the oil refineries.</i>

<i>You know, Springsteen,</i>
The Sopranos.

That's North Jersey.

But you have South Jersey,
which is basically
a different State.

But it's one huge Pine forest.

<i>If you get into</i>
<i>certain parts of it at night,</i>
<i>I mean, it is pitch black.</i>

<i>You don't hear</i>
<i>highway sounds,</i>

<i>you don't see anything.</i>

<i>So that too has</i>
<i>got a kind of...</i>

<i>romantic, otherworldly</i>
<i>feeling to it,</i>

<i>that maybe</i>
<i>there are creatures</i>
<i>out here.</i>

<i>Maybe there are</i>
<i>monsters out here.</i>

Well, the Pine Barrens
really is a peculiar place.

And although New Jersey
is the most densely populated
State in the union,

the Pine Barrens remains
very, very sparsely populated
part of the State.

<i>I think that</i>
<i>it's considered a no man's land</i>

<i>because of the vast expanse</i>
<i>of forest in an otherwise</i>
<i>heavily human dense area.</i>

We typically think of
the Northeastern seaboard

as a really dense space
for human population.

It's not like the Southeast,
or really the central area
of the United States,

where communities
are really spread out.

So, to have such a wide expanse
of space that's more or less
human unoccupied,

<i>it can kind of gain</i>
<i>this life of its own,</i>

<i>or this community understanding</i>
<i>that it's not a safe place,</i>

<i>that it's not a place</i>
<i>where humans are welcome.</i>

<i>Where it really belongs</i>
<i>to nature or the unexplored</i>
<i>or the unknown.</i>

<i>There's some really amazing</i>
<i>folklore books</i>
<i>about the Pine Barrens</i>

<i>because it has</i>
<i>a really fascinating</i>
<i>representation</i>

<i>in popular culture</i>
<i>as an incredibly haunted place,</i>

<i>for good reason, in that</i>
<i>when industry moved</i>
<i>out of that region</i>

<i>the forest overgrew</i>
<i>and overtook a lot</i>
<i>of the industry buildings</i>

<i>that were constructed to</i>
<i>support the steel production</i>
<i>in that area.</i>

The Pine Barrens.

I grew up in the Hudson Valley
of New York, and so
I was going around

and looking for,
you know, ghosts
and those sort of things there.

<i>As I got older and got</i>
<i>a driver's license</i>

<i>I started expanding</i>
<i>my horizons.</i>

<i>And, oddly enough,</i>
<i>in the early 80s,</i>

<i>the Meadowlands area</i>
<i>of New Jersey,</i>

<i>sort of became a place</i>
<i>where if you didn't want to go</i>
<i>into New York City</i>

<i>for a concert</i>
<i>or for a hockey event,</i>
<i>you could go to New Jersey.</i>

<i>And so I started doing that</i>

<i>and then found</i>
<i>that the hockey team</i>
<i>was the New Jersey Devils</i>

<i>that were named</i>
<i>after the Leeds Devil</i>
<i>and I was blown away by that.</i>

<i>I'm like, wait a second,</i>
<i>what's the story there?</i>

<i>And they started saying,</i>
<i>"Well, yeah,</i>

<i>if you go out</i>
<i>to the Pine Barrens,</i>
<i>that's where this thing lives."</i>

<i>And I thought, okay,</i>
<i>well, why hasn't</i>
<i>anybody found it yet?</i>

<i>And thinking that</i>
<i>the Pine Barrens</i>

<i>was going to be</i>
<i>just a little stretch</i>
<i>of woods,</i>

<i>a couple of acres or something</i>
<i>like that, and then went into</i>
<i>the Pine Barrens,</i>

<i>and it was like going into</i>
<i>another world.</i>

<i>I think a devil</i>
<i>could live back in here</i>

<i>if there was something,</i>
<i>as well as all other sorts</i>
<i>of monsters.</i>

<i>I mean, you could go forever</i>
<i>back there and not find</i>
<i>any other people.</i>

There's really no other legend
like the legend
of the Jersey Devil.

And, you know,
it's a unique legend in a unique
geographical location.

<i>I think the Jersey Devil</i>
<i>is kind of a</i>
<i>really good emblem,</i>

<i>to kind of represent</i>
<i>how interesting and unique</i>
<i>the Pine Barrens is.</i>

The creature itself
is kind of horsey,

sort of like a deer with wings.

But a lot of people have
actually claimed

<i>that what they are seeing</i>
<i>is a creature about the size</i>

<i>of a Collie</i>
<i>or a German Shepherd that has</i>
<i>a head more like a horse.</i>

<i>It has horns.</i>

Head of a horse.
It's got a head of a...

I've seen a head of a dog,
I saw a head of an ostrich,
I mean and cloven hooves.

<i>And it's got</i>
<i>typically bright red eyes,</i>

some kind of goat-like features,

and most importantly,
it's winged.

A thin body.

Either hooves or claws,

depending on the version
of the story
that you're hearing.

<i>So the wings</i>
<i>have carried through.</i>

<i>But this...</i>
<i>Does it have horse feet?</i>

<i>Does it have hooves</i>
<i>or the cloven hooves?</i>

That all seems to go away,
and it's more of
a giant winged cryptid.

Imagine Pegasus at the wrong end
of a really bad meth addiction.

<i>That's what the Jersey Devils</i>
<i>looks like.</i>

Descriptions of
the Jersey Devil,

match with the popular concept

of what the devil
would look like
if you were to encounter him.

Even though the <i>Bible</i> gives
a slightly different answer
to that question.

<i>Now, look,</i>
<i>all I'm saying is these</i>

<i>weird sightings taking place</i>
<i>in the Barrens</i>

<i>could really just be</i>
<i>some pineys</i>
<i>with overactive imaginations.</i>

<i>We're talking about people</i>
<i>claiming the kids</i>

<i>are performing</i>
<i>rituals in the woods now.</i>

<i>And they're raising the devil.</i>

<i>Really? This is where</i>
<i>we're at, really?</i>

<i>Supposedly, this demon</i>
<i>is some sort of flying horse</i>
<i>with wings,</i>

<i>and they're finding</i>
<i>tracks in the snow,</i>

<i>tracks in the sand.</i>

<i>And park rangers are running</i>
<i>into this thing and on and on.</i>

<i>Pineys, man.</i>

<i>We are in the middle</i>
<i>of this hysteria</i>
<i>over people performing rituals</i>

<i>by playing Dungeons & Dragons</i>
<i>or listening to hair metal.</i>

<i>Well, listen,</i>
<i>if this thing is a demon</i>

<i>summoned by hair metal,</i>
<i>sign me up for a look at it.</i>

Ranger station.

Hello, Miss Stockwell.

Yes, we we do have a curfew
in effect.

Dusk till dawn. Yeah.

No. No, it's always been
that way.

It's no acknowledgment
of a monster. No.

Those are all rumors.

Every single one of them.

Heavy metal freaks?

No, they're just good kids
having fun
on their bikes.

That's it. They're all in
the baseball team.

They don't hurt anything.

They clean up after themselves.

No. We've never found
any evidence of any
satanic rituals on the property.

No.

No, no, I can't arrest them. No.

All right. Thank you. Bye.

God bless!

Just say you're chicken.

You do not have botulism.

Whatever, Jake.
I'm going to land
murder hill tonight.

I need a witness.

Nobody's going to believe me.

You suck, Jake. You suck.

I'll do it on my own.

Hey, Mom.
Yeah, I'm going with Jake.

I know. I'll be home by 9:00.

No excuses.

Love you, too.

Hey!

All right. Stockwell, you win.

A master's degree in
wildlife resource management,

and I am nothing

but a glorified forest janitor.

<i>Come in, Dean,</i>
<i>you out there buddy?</i>

<i>It's Tom.</i>

Copy. Hey, Tom, what's up?

<i>Yeah, we got</i>
<i>a report of a missing kid</i>
<i>on a bike.</i>

Copy that. Yeah, sorry.

I'll... I'll go check it out.

No! Get away!

Tom?

Tom? Yeah.

I found the bike.

I think... I think it might be
your missing kid.

Send help! Send help!

Hey. Hey. Hey.

Just stay low, follow me, okay?
Come on. Come on. Come on.

<i>Dean, you there? Dean?</i>

What the hell
was that thing, kid?
What'd you get us into?

Okay, I'm gonna call...
I'm gonna call for backup.

I dropped my radio.

-What's your name?
-It's...

It's Paul.

Okay, Paul, listen.

I was in contact with the police
right before I found you.

There are other people out here
looking for us, okay?

They're gonna be here soon.

We just need to hunker down,
and we're gonna be okay.

All right?

Okay? We're going to be fine.

Just relax.

We're dead. We're dead.

We're gonna have to make a run
for my station, okay?

Okay.
Okay?

Run hard. Do not look back.

Do not look back.

All right. Let's move.

Come here!
Get back. Move.

Head down. Go! Go! Go!

Do it! Do it now!

Get down!

Well, in about 1982 is when
National Hockey League team

had moved to the New Jersey area
and was seeking names
for the club.

<i>The franchise</i>
<i>had a contest, actually.</i>

<i>Over 10,000 fans</i>
<i>evidently wrote in</i>

<i>to give their suggestions.</i>

<i>And one of them...</i>

<i>The one that won</i>
<i>was New Jersey Devils.</i>

<i>And that was</i>
<i>a deliberate callback</i>

<i>to the Jersey Devil legend.</i>

<i>So that, as far as I know,</i>

<i>it's the only major league team</i>
<i>in any sport</i>

<i>that features a cryptid</i>
<i>as its mascot.</i>

<i>It really is a reference</i>
<i>to the Leeds' story.</i>

Yeah, I think you'd be saying,
like the early 80s was

when it kicked in from the...

<i>The Satanic panic.</i>

<i>Fascinating period</i>
<i>in our history</i>
<i>that was really kicked off</i>

<i>in the 1980s,</i>

<i>where good,</i>
<i>God-fearing Americans</i>

<i>began to go</i>
<i>almost on witch hunts</i>

to strike out and find
those in their own community,

who were practicing
anything related to Satan.

This included any type
of occultist beliefs in,

you know, witches
or spirituality or crystals,
sageing, incense.

In fact, I've seen people
discuss the likelihood

<i>that trips into the</i>
<i>Pine Barrens will result</i>
<i>in finding places</i>

<i>where satanic sacrifices</i>
<i>have occurred,</i>

<i>or where occultists are doing</i>
<i>all sorts of sacrifices</i>

<i>and that's used as reasoning</i>
<i>for why people should not enter</i>
<i>the Pine Barrens,</i>

<i>is because it's this place</i>
<i>for satanic practice.</i>

A possible link between the 80s,
the Satanic panic,

and then the Jersey Devil
or Leeds Devil,

<i>I would get backlash</i>
<i>when I would tell people</i>

<i>I'm going to go look</i>
<i>for the Jersey Devil.</i>

<i>And it was,</i>
<i>"What are you looking</i>
<i>for the devil for?"</i>

But there certainly was,
for me, the backlash being like,

"What, are you playing
your records backwards, too?"

And doing
all that sort of stuff.

This is heightened when we think
of the role of the Jersey Devil

<i>and the stories</i>
<i>of the Jersey Devil's</i>
<i>origin as, you know,</i>

<i>either son of Satan</i>
<i>or in bonds with Satan</i>

<i>or offspring of Satan,</i>
<i>whatever it might be,</i>

<i>that sightings of this creature</i>

<i>known as the Jersey Devil</i>
<i>are reaching this new height,</i>

<i>this new purported wave.</i>

<i>Because it ties into</i>

<i>that overarching fear</i>
<i>that's gripping our nation.</i>

I remember there was some kind
of a wave of sightings
in the 80s.

And isn't that the one
where the police put up signs

<i>saying the Jersey devil</i>
<i>is a hoax?</i>

<i>The sightings, it seems</i>
<i>to come in like little waves,</i>
<i>and it's sporadic.</i>

<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>to account for that.</i>

<i>I think, obviously,</i>
<i>if somebody claims</i>

<i>that they saw the</i>
<i>Jersey Devil, it could</i>
<i>trigger copycat claims.</i>

<i>There are</i>
<i>a lot of newspaper reports</i>

<i>into the 80s,</i>
<i>and several of them</i>
<i>make reference to the Pineys,</i>

<i>the people who lived out there,</i>
<i>saying that the Leeds Devil</i>

<i>was sort of like the boogeyman,</i>

<i>that don't go out at night</i>
<i>or stay home or...</i>

<i>There are some reports where</i>
<i>they're actually saying</i>
it was almost like

<i>the Leeds Devil</i>
<i>was like Santa Claus,</i>

<i>that they knew</i>
<i>what you were doing.</i>

<i>And if you did anything bad,</i>
<i>the devil was coming for you.</i>

<i>Which, again, I think</i>
<i>is sort of interesting</i>

<i>when you look at and just say,</i>
<i>take the Leeds part out of that</i>

<i>and, hey, you do anything bad,</i>
<i>'the' devil is coming for you.</i>

<i>I could see how some of that</i>
<i>got transposed with each other.</i>

Typically, the sighting
is of a winged creature,

you know, either from the ground
taking off and flying,

<i>or being seen flying</i>
<i>through the woods themselves.</i>

<i>According to</i>
<i>the Asbury Park Press</i>

<i>of October 1988,</i>
<i>a man who lived</i>
<i>in Howell Township</i>

<i>encountered the devil in 1981.</i>

<i>He described the creature</i>

<i>as having a furry body,</i>
<i>huge feet with three toes</i>
<i>on each one,</i>

<i>large teeth and he stood</i>
<i>about six feet tall.</i>

I know a hunter,
a friend of mine who's a hunter
said he got up early

one morning to go deer hunting,
and he got in his stand

<i>and he kept hearing</i>
<i>some really strange,</i>
<i>loud noises.</i>

<i>And then in the opening</i>
<i>in the woods that was adjacent</i>
<i>to his hunting stand,</i>

<i>he saw a strange creature,</i>
<i>that was moving along</i>
<i>in the early morning.</i>

<i>Just barely light, you know?</i>
<i>It was making such</i>
<i>a loud noises</i>

<i>- and he couldn't account</i>
<i>for what kind of animal it was.</i>

<i>And he said he got out of</i>
<i>the stand and went back</i>
<i>to his truck and went home.</i>

<i>There were... I would say</i>
<i>there's a steady stream</i>
<i>of sightings.</i>

Yeah, I mean, in the 1980s,
there are some
very 80s-style sightings.

I mean, there was one
in which there were

a group of dirt bikers
who were riding around
in the Pine Barrens.

"In the late 1980s,

a couple of my friends and I
took a camping trip
to the Pine Barrens.

I was unaware
that we were headed to the home
of the Jersey devil.

We headed out on our bikes
and did our fair share
of partying that night.

<i>The next day,</i>
<i>while everyone was asleep,</i>

<i>three of us decided</i>
<i>to hit the trails</i>
<i>a bit earlier than usual.</i>

<i>We were about 100 yards away</i>
<i>in the woods</i>

<i>when my bike stalled out.</i>

<i>I looked and found</i>
<i>that my friends</i>
<i>had stalled also.</i>

<i>At first, I thought it had</i>
<i>something to do</i>
<i>with the terrain</i>

<i>or maybe something to do</i>
<i>with the nearby power plants.</i>

<i>Fifty feet away</i>
<i>from each other,</i>

<i>we tried to start up our bikes</i>
<i>when suddenly, from the woods,</i>

<i>we heard the most horrible,</i>
<i>piercing scream.</i>

<i>It sounded inhuman.</i>

<i>Like something being tortured.</i>

<i>Once back at camp,</i>
<i>they asked us if we had</i>
<i>heard screams earlier.</i>

<i>They had heard them, too,</i>
<i>about four miles away.</i>

<i>That night, we headed</i>
<i>into the local town</i>
<i>because we ran out of booze.</i>

<i>We went into a bar</i>
<i>and I ordered a drink</i>
<i>still in shock</i>

<i>from what I heard that morning.</i>
<i>The bartender asked,</i>

<i>'Hey, kid, what'd you see</i>
<i>a ghost or something?'</i>

<i>After I told him the story,</i>
<i>he smiled and said,</i>

<i>'Looks like you met</i>
<i>our little friend.'</i>

He then asked us
to come out back.

He showed us a tin garbage can
that was shredded to bits.

It looked like
the shreds were made
from something with three claws.

I've never returned
to the Pine Barrens since,
and I don't plan to go back."

But also in the 1980s,
there was very strange thing
that was reported.

I think that was 1980,
to be precise,

where there was some sort of
State game warden
or someone,

park ranger, perhaps,
that found, had a farm,
a group of pigs

<i>that had been eaten</i>
<i>like from the top</i>
<i>of their heads</i>

<i>had been gnawed off,</i>
<i>but there were no tracks</i>

<i>around any of the poor animals</i>
<i>that had met that end.</i>

<i>So the question... Even though</i>
<i>there's no eyewitness report</i>
<i>of a creature</i>

<i>that was still</i>
<i>raising questions about</i>

<i>that particular part</i>
<i>of the State.</i>

<i>There were once</i>
<i>State parks kind of came in</i>
<i>to play.</i>

<i>In general, you get a lot of</i>
<i>these generalizations about</i>

<i>park ranger saw this or...</i>

<i>Not just with the Leeds Devil,</i>
<i>but in general.</i>

<i>I think some people</i>
<i>will pull that in because</i>

<i>you now have</i>
<i>a credible witness.</i>

<i>You have a park ranger</i>
<i>that's going out there</i>

<i>and they would know the areas</i>
<i>so they would know</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

<i>So, I think</i>
<i>some of the urban legends,</i>
<i>if you will,</i>

<i>pull in park rangers</i>
<i>in general. That being said,</i>

<i>it would stand to reason</i>
<i>that people</i>
<i>who have the most chance</i>

of encountering the Leeds Devil
or the Jersey Devil
would be park rangers

or people that lived out there
because they spend the most time
out there, so.

By the 1980s, I think
there was a general sense

that there was a cryptid afoot
in the Pine Barrens.

<i>I think the</i>
<i>public consciousness</i>
<i>at that point was</i>

<i>already had taken</i>
<i>pretty good form.</i>

<i>And there would be things</i>
<i>that would come</i>
<i>a little bit later</i>

<i>like</i> Blair Witch Project,
<i>for example,</i>

<i>that drew even more attention</i>
<i>to that region of the country.</i>

So, in 1909,
it is the turn of the century.

Right? A lot is happening.

We're ramping up to World War I,

there is a lot of social change,

<i>there's a lot</i>
<i>of economic change,</i>

<i>and there's a ton</i>
<i>of industrial change.</i>

<i>All of that is kind of</i>
<i>circulating the air.</i>

<i>Interestingly, in January</i>
<i>that year between</i>
<i>16th and 23rd,</i>

<i>we see a rash</i>
<i>of newspaper publications</i>

that indicate an intense series
of sightings
of the Jersey Devil.

Some reporters go poking around,
and they speak to some people

living there,
especially the Pine Barrens.

And a few older people say,
"Well, you know,
when I was a little kid,

my grandpa talked
about the Leeds Devil.

Maybe it's the Leeds Devil
who is doing...
leaving these footprints

and, you know, stealing stuff
out of people's barns

<i>and chasing away their goats</i>
<i>and whatever."</i>

<i>And so slowly</i>
<i>that idea starts to build.</i>

Well, I think
the hardest story to explain
is the story

of the multiple sightings
of the Jersey Devil
in January, 1909,

<i>There were policemen</i>
<i>who fired their pistols</i>
<i>at the thing.</i>

<i>There were, you know,</i>

<i>people who reported</i>
<i>face to face encounters</i>
<i>with it.</i>

<i>People really were terrified.</i>

<i>The newspapers</i>
<i>picked up the stories.</i>

Well, in the 1909,
sighting flap of
the Jersey devil,

I think what characterized
that more than anything else

was the tracks that were found
all throughout the Pine Barrens

<i>and the surrounding towns.</i>

<i>So,</i>
<i>on the 16th of January,</i>
<i>which was a Saturday,</i>

<i>the creature was seen flying</i>
<i>over Woodbury, New Jersey.</i>

<i>On the 17th</i>
<i>in Bristol, Pennsylvania,</i>

<i>this is where several people</i>
<i>saw the creature in the tracks</i>
<i>that it created.</i>

<i>On Monday the 18th,</i>
<i>the town of Burlington</i>

<i>was covered in strange tracks,</i>
<i>which seemed to defy logic.</i>

<i>And then some of these</i>
<i>same tracks were found</i>
<i>in other towns.</i>

<i>Long track lines</i>
<i>that look like hoof prints</i>
<i>in the snow.</i>

<i>Those were seen all throughout</i>
<i>the area, even going up</i>
<i>onto people's roofs</i>

<i>and ascending and descending</i>
<i>and appearing and disappearing,</i>

<i>and that was sort of</i>
<i>the main feature</i>
<i>of all of those.</i>

<i>Two Gloucester hunters</i>

<i>also tracked the</i>
<i>creature's perplexing trail</i>

<i>for about 20 or so miles.</i>

<i>The trail, interestingly,</i>

appeared to jump fences
and squeeze under
eight-inch gaps.

So, not only did it have
an insane vertical leap but also
could shrink extremely small.

Newspapers even produced maps
showing all of the
different locations

where people had claimed
to have seen this thing.

<i>They followed tracks</i>
<i>in the snow</i>

<i>to see if they could</i>
<i>track the thing down</i>
<i>and kill it, you know.</i>

<i>Formed posses and they tried</i>
<i>to track it down.</i>

<i>What kind of tracks</i>
<i>they were actually following?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

When you look
at the published reports,

that's when you start to think
these are a little weird.

Because the Leeds Devil
was accused of everything
from attacking livestock

to attacking people.

In some versions,

people said that it was more
like a dragon and it was
breathing fire and that it was

setting like rail road tracks
on fire.

The one
that I've always been
fascinated with

and could never find anything,
except it was printed in

two newspaper reports,
is that police officer

<i>was making the rounds,</i>
<i>and he thought, he described it</i>

<i>as a giant closed umbrella</i>

<i>leaning against a fence post,</i>
<i>and he went over</i>

<i>to sort of pull it down</i>
<i>or what have you,</i>

<i>and it opened up</i>
<i>and spread its wings.</i>

<i>And he started wrestling</i>
<i>with this thing,</i>
<i>supposedly.</i>

<i>And then it just took off.</i>

<i>And I think</i>
<i>that's one of</i>
<i>the closest encounters,</i>

<i>if that really was</i>
<i>the Leeds Devil,</i>
<i>that I've found so far.</i>

<i>So I've always been</i>
<i>fascinated with that one.</i>

<i>And many towns</i>
<i>at this point</i>
<i>were panic stricken.</i>

<i>News had broken out</i>
<i>all across the area,</i>

<i>and they knew</i>
<i>that stuff was crazy.</i>

<i>Many businesses were closed</i>
<i>and schools were also closed</i>

<i>or they were forced to close</i>
<i>due to lack of attendance.</i>

<i>They were</i>
<i>still seeing it in</i>
<i>the Pine Barrens area.</i>

<i>But it pushed up into New York</i>
<i>and then specifically,</i>

<i>it made its way</i>
<i>into Philadelphia.</i>

<i>So we're not talking any more</i>
<i>about these</i>
<i>sort of isolated reports of,</i>

<i>you know, the pineys</i>
<i>that are seeing</i>
<i>something weird.</i>

<i>You're getting into</i>
<i>like Philadelphia.</i>

<i>So you're talking about</i>
<i>densely populated areas</i>

<i>that the creature</i>
<i>was roaming around.</i>

<i>And that, again,</i>
<i>is what's so fascinating</i>
<i>about the 1909 sightings.</i>

<i>The creature</i>
<i>apparently was not fazed</i>

<i>as it continued to rampage</i>

<i>through Philadelphia,</i>
<i>Pennsylvania and</i>
<i>West Collingswood, New Jersey,</i>

<i>where it was supposedly hosed</i>
<i>by the local fire department.</i>

<i>The devil seemed poised</i>
<i>to attack nearby people</i>

<i>who defensively threw</i>
<i>any available objects at it.</i>

The creature would suddenly
fly away,

<i>and it would reemerge later</i>
<i>only to injure a dog,</i>

<i>ripping a chunk of flesh</i>
<i>from its cheek</i>
<i>before the owner drove it away.</i>

<i>The idea of it</i>
<i>being seen, any cryptid,</i>

<i>being seen</i>
<i>in a densely populated</i>
<i>major city is,</i>

it's unheard of.

You know, it's very unique
because most of
any cryptid sightings

and the vast majority
of the Leeds Devil story,

then Jersey Devil stories
are in remote areas

that you've got one
or two witnesses,

or if it's over
a series of days.

Maybe you've got
a handful of witnesses.

<i>We're talking hundreds</i>
<i>of witnesses</i>
<i>allegedly taking place</i>

<i>in a major city.</i>

At this time, the primary way
that people would receive news

was from the morning
and evening paper

that would be published
by local printing presses

as well as
a few regional papers.

And many communities
would have several newspapers,

so people were always vying
for the best report,
the best headlines

because they wanted their papers
to sell above everybody else's.

And, if you had
the most popular newspaper,

you were afforded a very special

and particular type of esteem
in your community.

I have heard before
that there is thought that

this story or series of stories

was concocted in order
to sell newspapers

because this area
saw the opportunity

and as one paper started to do
really well, the next paper
would make up another story

and it would only grow and grow
and grow and grow and grow.

It's really been alleged
that a lot
of the 1909 sightings,

the track finds were one thing,

but the sightings
may have been planted
in the media

by those who were looking
to sell tickets

to their Dime Museum
in Philadelphia.

<i>There is a place</i>
<i>in Philadelphia</i>

<i>which, unfortunately,</i>
<i>is no longer there,</i>

<i>called the 9th & Arch Street</i>
<i>Dime Museum.</i>

<i>It's a parking lot now,</i>
<i>in downtown, Philadelphia.</i>

<i>And Dime Museums</i>
<i>were really popular</i>

<i>in the late 19th,</i>
<i>early 20th centuries.</i>

<i>They were basically</i>
<i>circus side shows</i>

<i>and you know you'd have</i>
<i>the two-headed babies in a jar,</i>

<i>you'd have the skinny man</i>
<i>and the fat lady,</i>

<i>and you'd have jugglers</i>
<i>and all that.</i>

<i>All that sort of carnival stuff</i>
<i>that we think of.</i>

<i>All in this one place.</i>

<i>But the 9th & Arch Street</i>
<i>in Philadelphia</i>

<i>is slowly beginning to fall</i>
<i>on hard times.</i>

Because just like today,
you can shock people,

but after a while
the shock wears off
and now you want a new shock.

And so they're running
out of shocks.

They're trying to figure,
"What do we do?

How do we get people
to start coming back to this?"

And they see
the newspaper reports
about these strange goings on

in the woods,

and as soon as they see that
they think, "Jackpot!"

That will bring people in.

What they ended up doing

was not only planting stories
it's alleged
in the local media newspapers,

but staging Jersey Devil Hunt,

<i>going out and claiming</i>
<i>to find something</i>

<i>and bringing it back</i>
<i>to the Arch and 9th Street</i>
<i>Museum in Philadelphia,</i>

<i>where it could be viewed</i>
<i>for a modest fee.</i>

<i>And so now</i>
<i>they start advertising</i>

<i>"We've captured</i>
<i>the Jersey Devil."</i>

<i>"Come see the Jersey Devil."</i>

<i>And the lines</i>
<i>are now around the corner.</i>

So the way they had it set up
in a big room, darkened room.
Cage on the stage.

<i>You can't see what's in it.</i>

<i>They bring a bunch of people in</i>

<i>and there's a barker there,</i>
<i>you know,</i>
<i>"Jersey Devil eats people."</i>

"Peek. Don't get too close.

<i>Because you don't want to."</i>
<i>And they pull the curtain off.</i>

<i>And here's this thing.</i>

And what people saw
when they went into the museum,
in a cage, was a kangaroo

that had been fitted
with some sort of

contraption that made it look
like it had wings

and painted
in shades or stripes of green.

This creature,
this poor kangaroo, evidently,
there was some sort of

sharp object
that it was poked with
and make a lot of aloud sound

that would alarm the patrons
who had gone there to see it.

And so, word gets out,
you know it's not real,
and so that's the end of it.

After this, people asked them,
"Why did you fake this?"

"We're a Dime Museum.
That's what we do.

We fake stuff.

Why did you believe us
when we told you
we had this thing?"

And so after a while,
you know, it all dies down.

But why that's all important
is because now
this name Jersey Devil

has gotten into the bloodstream

and people start coming out
of the woodwork saying,

<i>"I know it's real.</i>

<i>I've seen it."</i>

There's this thought that
this story
or series of stories

was concocted in order
to sell newspapers.

Because this area
saw the opportunity

and as one paper
started to do really well,

the next paper
would make up another story

and it would only grow and grow
and grow and grow and grow.

<i>However, in other</i>
<i>cryptid sightings</i>

<i>that have been primarily spread</i>
<i>by newspaper reports,</i>

<i>There's less of</i>
<i>a vested interest</i>
<i>in that type of one-upsmanship</i>

<i>hoax culture that would persist</i>
<i>for one week</i>
<i>and then completely disappear.</i>

<i>What we normally see is that</i>
<i>one paper will publish a story</i>

<i>and then the next will offer</i>
<i>rewards or potential scoops</i>

<i>or will maybe publish a photo.</i>

But there's not
typically this addition

of a more complex narrative
that would quote people directly

or that would involve
the local fire department,

for instance,
that would be less likely

to be seen in that area
or that time period.

It's been alleged, you know
that the 1909 sightings

and the reports in the media
essentially launched
the Jersey Devil

as we know it today,
and that would be
very convenient.

But what is so interesting
is that it's simply a matter

of record that in 1859,
which of course predates 1909,

<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>

<i>ran a lengthy story about a man</i>

<i>who went to the Pine Barrens</i>
<i>and interviewed locals,</i>

<i>some of whom</i>
<i>told him the legend</i>
<i>of the Jersey Devil.</i>

<i>And not only that,</i>

<i>but talking about the fact</i>
<i>that some strange creature</i>

<i>had been seen in that area</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

<i>And that occasionally</i>
<i>in the Pine Barrens,</i>

<i>there's something flying about</i>
<i>or messing with</i>
<i>people's livestock.</i>

<i>So that is the fly</i>
<i>in the ointment,</i>

<i>as far as saying that</i>
<i>there is a neat tie to 1909,</i>

<i>which explains it all.</i>
<i>It simply doesn't.</i>

There are tribal beliefs
associated with that area,

particularly in terms
of the landscape.

So, one of the ways
that tribal communities
preserve their stories

<i>is by having the place name</i>

<i>of a physical place</i>
<i>tied directly to a story.</i>

<i>In the Pine Barrens,</i>
<i>the Lenape tribes</i>

<i>knew the area as 'Poppuessing',</i>

<i>which meant</i>
<i>'The place of the dragon'.</i>

<i>When Swedish settlers</i>
<i>then came into the area,</i>

<i>they adopted</i>
<i>a form of that name</i>

<i>and also knew it as</i>
<i>the place of the dragon.</i>

<i>For these tribal groups,</i>
<i>it was more about the structure</i>
<i>of the place.</i>

<i>So the land and the interaction</i>
<i>between the forests</i>
<i>and the water</i>

<i>created spaces or inlets</i>

<i>that were reminiscent</i>
<i>of native tribal stories</i>

<i>that included those patterns</i>
<i>like dragons</i>

<i>or other type</i>
<i>of monstrous creatures.</i>

<i>And so that land</i>
<i>became known as that</i>

<i>as the result of those.</i>
<i>Not inherently,</i>
<i>because there was a dragon</i>

<i>that was sighted there</i>
<i>by those native folk.</i>

There is good reason to believe
that the legend traces

all the way back
to the Native Americans
in this area.

The Native Americans,
in this area believed
that there was a spirit being

that lived in the wilderness,
and they had a ceremony

that they performed
for this spirit.

<i>The Lenape tribe</i>
<i>had a whole variety of</i>

<i>folkloric figures that</i>
<i>they were able to describe</i>

<i>to the Europeans</i>
<i>when they arrived.</i>

<i>The one that corresponds</i>

<i>to the Jersey Devil</i>
<i>most closely was a</i>
<i>deity figure called Mising.</i>

<i>And Mising is the one that had</i>
<i>the head and body of the deer.</i>

<i>A male deer with antlers</i>
<i>and bat-like wings,</i>

<i>and was seen as sort of</i>
<i>a protector of the forest.</i>

As the European settlers
come in,

and most of them with a very
strong religious perspective,

there would be a crossover
that would take place

between native legends
and beliefs in folklore
and beliefs

<i>that were often rooted</i>
<i>in biblical Christianity.</i>

<i>In the case of the Lenape,</i>
<i>there was a religious group</i>

<i>that they actually were able</i>
<i>to coexist with quite well,</i>

<i>and that was the Quakers.</i>

<i>The Quaker people</i>
<i>and the Lenape</i>

<i>actually lived</i>
<i>very well together.</i>

<i>But what they were</i>
<i>able to do then,</i>

<i>of course,</i>
<i>is share their stories</i>
<i>in a non-threatening way.</i>

<i>And so from the Lenape,</i>

Quakers would have heard
descriptions like this

that would have conjured images
that were,
at the very least, devilish,

or that would have fit
sort of the artistic renderings
of demons and devils

<i>in the 1600s and 1700s.</i>

So the basic story
the Jersey Devil,

and there are
variations of this,

is that 1735, a woman
named Mother Leeds living in the
depths of the Pine Barrens

gives birth to her 13th child.

Mother Leeds was either a witch
or a woman

upon whom someone had placed
a curse.

My favorite version is the one
where the child is born

and it looks
like a natural baby.

But then in a short time,
even in the immediate wake

of the delivery,
it starts to change.

When the child was born,
it looked normal.

But then immediately morphed
into this amalgam

of every sort of creature
known and unknown.

The mother's screaming.

The midwife is screaming.

Everyone's confused
and scared and terrified.

The child then
burst through the door

to the adjoining room,
where Mister Leeds

and the prior 12 children
are all huddled,

scared by the sounds
coming from this room.

The creature kills
as many as it can,

<i>and then it flies off</i>
<i>into the night,</i>

<i>only to be seen</i>
<i>on rare occasions</i>

<i>or by people who invoke</i>
<i>the devil themselves.</i>

<i>You've heard it said</i>
<i>many times.</i>

<i>There's as many</i>
<i>as 30 variations.</i>
<i>Probably more than that.</i>

<i>When Mother Leeds</i>
<i>comes into play</i>

<i>in the early versions,</i>
<i>she's a witch</i>

and she is able to sort of
shape shift.

And I found a really
interesting article that made
reference to the fact that

the Leeds Devil was sort of
a European version
of a werewolf.

And I'm like,
"Okay, I get that part."

<i>But then</i>
<i>there were also versions</i>
<i>that Mother Leeds</i>

<i>had a child</i>
<i>and the father was the devil.</i>

But the problem
with the whole story

is that the real story,

the Jersey Devil,
has nothing
to do with a monster.

A physical monster.

It's a political story.

It is a story
that gets to the depths of

small town culture
versus big town culture,

religious culture,
land grabs
from Native Americans,

the crushing of outspoken women.

This is the beginnings
of fake news in America.

It's the beginnings
of sensationalist
media coverage.

It's an American thing
before there's an America.

This sort of thing
is already going on.

And so the the story,

the Jersey Devil
is at the heart of that.

Hello.

I've been sent by the agency.

Hello?

I've been summoned
by your husband.

I'm here from the agency
to offer services.

I hope there
hasn't been a mistake.

Hello?

The agency sent me
on behalf of Mr. Leeds,
summoned for service.

Is anyone at home?

If no one is at home,
I shall have no choice
but to enter.

My transport
has already departed.

Hello? Mrs. Leeds?

I can hear you up there.

This is the Leeds residence,
is it not?

I'm sorry again
to have let myself in,

but I am a long way away
from the...
Rest.

I'm sorry?

I only need rest.

Make yourself at home,
but leave me to my rest.

Mrs. Leeds, as for my duties,
we really should--

Till tomorrow, girl. Tomorrow,

For now, I only need rest.

"Concerning ritual offerings.

The 13th child is brought forth
in exchange
for a bountiful season."

The baby is here.
It's already coming.

I can't. I can't!

Don't worry. Don't worry!
I'll fetch the water.

There's no time for textbook.
It's already on its way...

All right.

Keep breathing.

In and out.

Breathe well.

Keep breathing.

In and out.

It's going to be all right.

Keep breathing.

In and out. In... Good.

Very good.

It's going
to be all right, Mrs. Leeds.

Daniel Leeds.
He's the central character.

He's what the whole story...

If there's no Daniel Leeds,
there's no Jersey Devil.

<i>He's this</i>
<i>really interesting guy.</i>

<i>He's a Quaker.</i>

<i>The Quakers</i>
<i>were people in England.</i>

<i>They're religious people.</i>
<i>They are Christians</i>

<i>who are separatists</i>
<i>from the mainstream</i>
<i>Anglican church.</i>

<i>The Anglicans don't like...</i>
<i>the Puritans hate the Quakers.</i>

<i>So there are laws being passed</i>
<i>in England,</i>

<i>Anti-Quaker laws,</i>
<i>because they saw the Quakers</i>
<i>as subversive.</i>

<i>And so what they decide to do</i>
<i>is some of them come here</i>

<i>to what is then</i>
<i>British North America.</i>

<i>And now we're talking about</i>
<i>1650s, 1660s.</i>

<i>Young. He's like 25.</i>

He comes from England.
He comes with his father
and his two brothers.

<i>His contribution to life</i>
<i>will be,</i>

<i>he's gonna bring the tenants</i>
<i>of the scientific revolution</i>

<i>and the age of enlightenment</i>
<i>to North America.</i>

<i>And remember at the time,</i>

<i>In the late 1600s, America</i>
<i>is the edge of the empire.</i>

Rather than having 13 children,
he did have 12.

One of whom was Titan Leeds,
the son of Daniel Leeds.

So one of the ways

in which Daniel made his mark
in his community

<i>was by settling an area.</i>

<i>He was a land surveyor,</i>

<i>so he was gifted</i>
<i>a piece of land</i>

<i>in order to survey it</i>
<i>for the kingdom.</i>

<i>And he named it Leeds Town.</i>

<i>And while he was there,</i>
<i>he started his own almanac.</i>

<i>And he thinks, "Okay,</i>

<i>this is where I'm going</i>
<i>to start this thing.</i>

<i>I'm gonna bring education.</i>

<i>I want to bring area addition</i>
<i>to the to the wilderness."</i>

<i>And the Quaker fathers</i>
<i>of Burlington hate him.</i>

<i>They think it's too occulty,</i>

<i>they think it's unchristian</i>

<i>and they want to get rid of it.</i>

<i>And they literally go around</i>
<i>and they buy up</i>

<i>every copy that's gotten out</i>
<i>into circulation</i>

and they burn them.

So Daniel Leeds, not just
the first author in New Jersey.

He's the first censored
author in New Jersey.

They viewed his almanac
as too astrological

and is promoting a more esoteric

understanding of nature
and not something grounded

in, you know,
thoughts related to God

or like God's prophecies,
or communicating with God.

So, originally, the almanac
was published
under the Quaker Society.

But after the Quakers
pushed back,

<i>Daniel decided to publish</i>
<i>under his own kind of arm</i>
<i>or branch instead.</i>

<i>And so, the publishing changed,</i>
<i>and he leaned more</i>

<i>into the astrological</i>
<i>end of things.</i>

<i>He published an almanac</i>
<i>that was based on astrology,</i>

<i>he went on to write a book</i>
<i>called the</i> Temple of <i>Wisdom,</i>

<i>in which he tried to synthesize</i>
<i> all these streams of thought,</i>

<i>both of which the Quakers</i>
<i>were very much against.</i>

<i>They demanded an apology</i>
<i>from him,</i>
<i>which he gave under duress.</i>

<i>But then he went on</i>
<i>to write these pamphlets</i>

<i>that were</i>
<i>virulently anti-Quaker.</i>

<i>And again, that got him</i>
<i>labeled as the</i>
<i>Leeds Devil, essentially.</i>

<i>And he flips</i>
<i>on the Quakers.</i>

<i>He converts to Anglicanism,</i>
<i>he starts putting out</i>
<i>a new version</i>

<i>of the almanac in which</i>
<i>he basically attacks Quakerism</i>

<i>in every issue.</i>

<i>The Quakers are liars.</i>

<i>The Quakers are this.</i>
<i>The Quakers are that.</i>
<i>The Quakers are bad people.</i>

<i>The Quakers get mad,</i>
<i>so they start publishing</i>
<i>anti-Daniel Leeds pamphlets.</i>

<i>And so there's this kind of</i>
<i>tennis match</i>
<i>going back and forth</i>

<i>where Leeds publishes</i>
<i>an anti-Quaker pamphlet,</i>

the Quakers publish
an anti-Leeds pamphlet,

and it goes on and on
like that for a while.

There were some instances
of anti-Quaker propaganda

and then responses
that were made
by the Quaker groups,

including, you know
referring to Daniel Leeds

<i>in some instances</i>
<i>as the Devil himself.</i>

<i>As he continued his separation</i>
<i>from the Quakers,</i>
<i>he started to include</i>

<i>his family crest on</i>
<i>the almanac, which</i>
<i>included dragons on it,</i>

<i>and that was seen</i>
<i>as a further evidence</i>

of a ultimately evil
interaction with Satan

through his publication
of that text.

That whole pamphlet war
between Daniel Leeds
and the Quakers.

Quakers accusing him
of being Satan's harbinger,
of being evil.

<i>Obviously, that's the ultimate</i>
<i>source of that.</i>

<i>There's two monsters here.</i>

<i>There is the Jersey Devil,</i>
<i>but there's also</i>
<i>the Leeds Devil,</i>

<i>which comes out first.</i>

<i>The Leeds Devil is much more</i>
<i>of a political animal.</i>

<i>Now, did the Quakers plan</i>
<i>on creating a monster legend?</i>

<i>You know, probably not.</i>

<i>I think that's</i>
<i>the ultimate genesis,</i>
<i>which takes us, you know,</i>

<i>two-hundred-some years later</i>
<i>to the thing</i>
<i>we know today.</i>

Now, this is not attached
to a monster yet.

It's still just
a political idea.

Revolution comes along
and then the years go by.

<i>By the end of the 18th</i>
<i>into the early 19th century,</i>

<i>up until around the time</i>
<i>of the Civil War,</i>

<i>the idea of the Leeds Devil</i>
<i>basically has gone extinct.</i>

<i>But in the second half</i>
<i>of the 19th century,</i>
<i>post-Civil War,</i>

<i>you start to get people</i>
<i>talking about</i>
<i>the Leeds Devil again.</i>

<i>When we tell</i>
<i>the Jersey Devil story,</i>

how much of the details
can we change

until it's no longer
the Jersey Devil story
and it's something else?

How critical are the Leeds
to the story being understood
and replicated?

Because if we think about it,
there are tons of versions

where Mother Leeds has these
different roles that she plays.

In some, she is the wife
of a wealthy,
well-providing man.

In some, she's the wife
of a drunkard
who treats her horribly,

abuses their family,
is the worst in the world.

In some, she is
a practicing witch,
going against all of the

Christian and Quaker values
that one could possibly have.

<i>In some, she's a scorned lover.</i>

<i>I mean, it ranges</i>
<i>all across the place</i>

<i>for where the origin</i>
<i>of this creature came from.</i>

<i>But all of it</i>
<i>ties back to her,</i>

<i>she becomes</i>
<i>this central figure.</i>

<i>So is she really</i>
<i>the protagonist of</i>
<i>the Jersey Devil story?</i>

Early in the 1600,
this is like 1630, 1640,

there was a woman
named Anne Hutchinson,

<i>who was also nonconformist,</i>
<i>ran into problems</i>

<i>with the Puritan Church</i>
<i>in Boston and got kicked</i>
<i>out of Boston, essentially.</i>

<i>Settled in Providence,</i>
<i>Rhode Island.</i>

<i>Had a number of children,</i>
<i>as many as 16.</i>

<i>The 16th child that she had</i>
<i>was by our thinking today,</i>

our terminology,
was a miscarriage.

And somehow that became
public knowledge,

and the Puritans found out
about it and used it as a way
to smear her name.

Essentially, by saying,
look, you know, here she is,

this rebellious woman.
She's pushed
against orthodoxies

and she had this horrible birth,

you know, monstrous birth,
by some accounts.

And it's just she's getting
what she deserved,
is what they were

probably more than implying.

So, that sets in
by the mid-1600s,

this idea in some of the
public's consciousness

that a result or consequence
for pushing
against historical orthodoxies

<i>could be that you'd be</i>
<i>punished in a very sad</i>
<i>and grotesque way.</i>

<i>And you see some crossover</i>
<i>between Hutchinson</i>
<i>and the story of Mother Leeds.</i>

<i>It's fairly obvious.</i>

Our book,
<i>The Secret Life</i>
<i>Of The Jersey Devil.</i>

It is, in large part,
a biography of the Leeds family.

Because they are at the heart
of this whole thing,
especially Daniel Leeds.

And what's also interesting
is by the time

the term 'Leeds Devil'
comes along,

Daniel and Titan Leeds
are gone.

They never really know

that they've been accused,
that they played
the part in this story.

<i>There is no monster.</i>

<i>I don't think necessarily</i>
<i>that the historical precedent,</i>

although it's
extremely intriguing,

and the Leeds story as sort of
apocryphal and clearly folklore

rather than reporting fact.

Because as clear as
that would seem to be,

<i>that doesn't disprove the idea</i>
<i>that there's something</i>
<i>physically strange</i>

<i>or at least startling</i>
<i>that no one could find</i>
<i>in the Pine Barrens.</i>

<i>So what that is, is if it's</i>
<i>a horse with bat wings,</i>

<i>I mean, I have my doubts</i>
<i>about that.</i>

<i>But it's not out of the realm</i>
<i>of possibility that</i>

<i>something strange or misshapen</i>
<i>or simply undiscovered,</i>

<i>people are encountering that.</i>

<i>That seems to be the case</i>
<i>wherever people are</i>
<i>on these spaces,</i>

<i>you know, away from the city,</i>
<i>away from the suburbs,</i>

<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>off of their comfortable turf.</i>

<i>We tend to bump into things</i>
<i>that we can't recognize</i>
<i>right away.</i>

I believe that when people
were encountering

definitely the Leeds Devil,

that they were seeing
multiple creatures.

And it's just because
if you were to line up
all the different descriptions

that people, especially
in the 1909 sightings,
what they were seeing,

it can't be the same creature.

<i>People are seeing</i>
<i>multiple known creatures,</i>

<i>but because</i>
<i>in the back of their mind</i>

<i>they've got, "There's a devil</i>
<i>out here somewhere.</i>

<i>I bet that's what I heard.</i>

<i>I bet that's what I saw."</i>

<i>Now, that being said,</i>
<i>those do not explain</i>
<i>all of the sightings.</i>

I think that different people
have seen different things

or heard different things
and attributed that
to a Jersey Devil sighting,

<i>even though they had</i>
<i>different experiences,</i>

<i>they're all calling it</i>
<i>a Jersey Devil encounter.</i>

<i>But I think there's also</i>
<i>the possibility that we all</i>
<i>carry around some imagery</i>

<i>in our minds that, you know,</i>
<i>is common throughout the world.</i>

<i>When you think about everything</i>
<i>from totem pole figures to</i>

<i>gargoyles to, you know,</i>
<i>demonic-looking figures</i>

<i>that are depicted</i>
<i>in China or India.</i>

<i>All over the world, people have</i>
<i>this kind of imagery</i>

<i>that emerges in different forms</i>
<i>of art.</i>

<i>I think it's possible that</i>
<i>during a frightening moment,</i>
<i>when you're</i>

<i>maybe by yourself out</i>
<i>in the woods and you've</i>
<i>heard a strange sound</i>

<i>or you saw a form</i>
<i>that startled you,</i>

<i>it might trigger</i>
<i>that kind of imagery.</i>

<i>I can only speculate,</i>
<i>but that's the only way</i>

<i>I can account for the fact</i>
<i>that so many people</i>
<i>have claimed</i>

<i>to have seen the same,</i>
<i>you know, or roughly</i>
<i>the same thing.</i>
