<i>Christmas is almost here.</i>

<i>And after that day,
I know my life will never be the same.</i>

<i>I'm a little scared.</i>

<i>Well, to be honest, a lot scared.</i>

<i>What will happen to me, to us?</i>

<i>And then there's little Jacob.</i>

<i>What about him?</i>

<i>I just hope he'll be okay.</i>

There he is!

How's everybody doing?
See you in there. Thanks for coming.

In Book Five, will we finally
learn the truth about Camille?

Is she part of the French Resistance
like she says?

Or is she really a Nazi spy?

You know, I've been going
back and forth on that one.

Make her a heroine!
Oh, it's so much more romantic.

Yeah...
Then again, a spy is sexier.

Hmm! You know what?

Double agent.

Oh!

Could you inscribe it to Sherri, please?
I'm Sherri.

So is it an "I" or a "Y"?

Either is fine.

You recognize me, <i>non</i>? Book Three.

Of course, of course!
Camille Toussaint. How are you?

Very well, sir. Very well.

Merry Christmas, Camille.

Thank you so much!

Make it outÂ to Todd and Mark.

Sure.

Oh, make that Mark and Todd.
I read the book first.

No way. Don't you remember?
Your sister gave it to me.

No, your sister gave it to me...
Tell you what, fellas.

You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go ahead and sign two books.

One for each of you, okay?

My treat. There you go.

So, are you staying in the city
for the holidays?

I'm afraid not.

Gotta get home to my girl, Ava.
Oh.

I didn't know that you were...

Well, she's a very lucky woman.

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

Ava, hon, I'm home!

Ava?

Come here! Come here, baby.

What's up? How are you? Come here! Hi! Hi!

Welcome home, Mr. Jacob.
Oh, thanks, Svet. Thanks.

Hi, how are you? Hello!

Everything under control? Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

Yeah. Refrigerator is full. Ava has bath.
Yeah. Okay.

I bring in extra firewood.

Oh, and, uh, fan mail.

Oof.

More even than last book, I think.

Wow. Okay, fan mail. Look at that.

Now I know what I'm doing
for the next couple weeks, right?

Thank you for
holding down the fort while I was gone.

Mmm-hmm.
Oh, I almost forgot.

This, Svetlana, is for you.
Oh!

Happy holidays.

And, you know, thank you for everything.
Oh, thank you.

You're gonna be okay, Mr. Jacob?

Okay? Yeah, what do you mean?
It's me. Of course. I'm always okay.

But also always alone.

I'm alone because I prefer it that way,
you know that. Besides, I'm not alone.

I got my best girl here, Ava.
She'll keep me company.

See you next year, Mr. Jacob.
Yeah! See you, you know...

Ava! Come here.

Let's, uh, see what we got here.

No.

Ah, there we go. All right.

I could get down with that.
That's good. That is good.

Hello?
<i>- Hi, is this, uh, Jacob Turner?</i>

Yeah, this is,

but, you know, I don't need
my carpets cleaned, or a home loan, or...

<i>Yeah. Uh, Mr. Turner, apologies.
I was, uh... hesitant to leave a message.</i>

<i>My name is Matt Segreto. I'm an attorney...</i>

Oh, let me guess. You have a client
who claims I stole one of their ideas.

<i>No, um...</i>

<i>I'm the executor of your mother's estate.</i>

I'm sorry. You're, uh... What was that?

<i>I really am sorry
to be the one to tell you. Uh...</i>

<i>She passed last week.</i>

<i>I thought you knew.</i>

No, I... I didn't know that.

My mother and I
hadn't spoken in a long time.

Our relationship was, uh...

complicated.

<i>I understand.</i>

<i>She left everything to you, um,
her house and all her furnishings.</i>

<i>There's some paperwork
that needs to be signed.</i>

<i>Um, I can arrange to meet you
in Bridgeport one dayÂ next week,</i>

<i>if that's convenient.</i>

Mr. Turner.
Hey!

Matt Segreto.

Thanks for meeting me out here.
Yeah.

I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.

Place must bring back a lot of memories.

You have no idea.

You just, uh...
Yeah.

Oh!

Careful.

Whoa.

Ugh.

Yeah, neighbors said
she rarely left the house.

And when they dropped by,
she never let them in.

Now I know why.

Should be a piano
hiding over here somewhere.

Um, yep. According to the inventory,
it's a Steinway Model S, 1940.

It's worth about 40 grand.

Hmm.

From the look of things,
you're gonna be doing a lot of trash runs.

Do you want me to
get a dumpster rental for you?

Huh?

Oh, uh...Â Yeah.

Thanks.
Yeah.

And, um, Mr. Turner...

Jake.

I hate to bother you,
but myÂ wife is just a huge fan, and, um...

Okay.

You know, us Regular Joes
can never really live up

to the super-suave dudes in your books.

Those dudes aren't real, Matt.

Yeah, tell that to my wife.

Her name's Mercedes.

Like the car.

Right.

Here you go.
Thank you.

Come on, babe.

All right, you ready? Hop on up.

Good girl.

Simply exquisite.

Ellie, is that you?

Jacob, you came!

Of course.

I don't know, somehow I assumed
that you'd send an assistant or someone,

I guess because you're so famous now.

No, some things you gotta do on your own.
So good to see you. You look great.

You too. It's been a long time.
What, it's 20 years, probably?

You were about 18 when you left.
17 when I left.

That was
a really tough time for you.

Yeah, it was.

But, you know,
I always knew you'd be a writer.

You were an interesting kid.

You had a wonderful imagination,
and you loved words.

I remember sitting in your den for hours,
playing online <i>Scrabble.</i>

Oh, whenever your mom
had a really bad day.

Mom had a lot of bad days, didn't she?

She was never the same.

None of us were.

They're good!

Oh, wonderful.
That's sweet. Thank you.

Bye-bye now.
Bye.

Hey, are you still painting?

You might as well
ask if I'm still breathing.

Listen, I'm glad I ran into you.
It's good to see you.

I'm about ready to take off. I gotta, um...

I gotta come back tomorrow
and tackle another room.

It's gotta be really,
really hard going through all her stuff.

Yeah. What was it
that Robert Frost always said?

He said, "The best way out
is always through," right?

Although I'm pretty sure
he never met a hoarder.

I would imagine not.

It's lonely out here.

And I miss you.

Oh, God! Oh, come on!

Oh, come on,Â Mom, really?

What?

Still like a grilled cheese
with tomato soup?

I figured you'd probably worked up
a pretty good appetite by now.

You kidding? I'm starving.

Does she like tomato soup? Is this okay?
She loves it. Yeah. Yeah, it's great.

Oh, there you go.

Oh, she does!
Look at that!

We don't know how to thank you.
Do we, Ava?

You could put me in your next novel.
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

You actually read my novels?

I'm probably the only one of your readers
who can recognize some of the characters.

Like whom, for instance?

Well, in <i>Green Eyes.
Green Eyes of Paris.</i>

Yeah, the photographer.

Beautiful, strong woman
who has a breakdown.

Well, that one's pretty obvious,
though, right?

There's another character I recognize,
you know, in <i>The Final Midnight.</i>

The father of the soldier.

Very minor character, though.
Sort of like in real life.

Your memories of him can't be all that bad
if you're still wearing his watch.

He came to your mother's funeral.
Did you know that?

To pay his respects, but I'm pretty sure
he was hoping to see you there.

No, I don't...

I don't think so, no.

And the funeral... the funeral, I feel...

It's understandable,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

That was then. This is now.

Thanks.

And can I ask you a question?
Yeah.

It's personal.
Sure.

Um...

Am I too old for this?

Are...

This is your question?
Yes.

No! No.

Seriously?
This is perfect.

Have you tried one of these?
Of course not. Why would you?

You got women linin' up on your doorstep.

I do not have women
lining up on my doorstep.

I see those magazines at the supermarket.
You date movie stars.

All right.
Listen, they will print anything.

But the answer to your question,
no, I have not tried a dating app,

but I think you absolutely should.

I have to write something.

Dating profile?
Yeah.

I know a writer. May I?

You're gonna write my profile? Oh!
It would be my pleasure.

Hmm.

Come on in, Ellie. Door's open.

Hello?
You're not Ellie.

Uh, no. No, I'm not.

No, it's just...
I thought you were my neighbor.

Oh, sorry.

You were here before, right?

You were across the street?
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

I'm not some kind of
weird stalker or anything,

if that's what you're thinking.

No, I didn't think you were.
Could you close the door behind you?

Do you mind?
Yeah, of course. Yeah, um...

What can I do for you?

Hey. He's cute. Good boy.

Girl, actually. That's Ava.

Cool name. Hey, Ava.

Um...

This is the Turner residence, right?

Sort of. Sort of.
Uh, I'm Jake Turner.

Great. Nice to meet you, Mr. Turner.

My name's Rachel Campbell.
And the reason I'm here...

Sorry, this is a little complicated,
but I'm trying to find my mother.

And I think you might be able to help me.

She used to live here
a long time ago, I think. I hope.

Your mother lived here in this house?

Yeah, um, when I was born...

Rather, right before I was born,
she lived...

This is Scott
and Lois Turner's house, right?

Yeah. Uh, well, yeah. My parents.

Great. So, yeah,Â my birth mother,
she lived here and she worked for them.

Your mother worked for my parents?

From what I can tell,
she was actually their nanny.

Um...

Whoa! No! Oh, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!
Okay, hold on! Hold...

Ow! That's hot.

You need a hand?

No, no, it's...

I got it under control.
Okay.

Ah, forget it.
Okay.

So what brings Nancy Drew
to the Turner house, anyway?

If you don't mind me asking.

It wasn't easy.
My adoption file was sealed.

But a friend of mine worked
for the Connecticut Records Department.

By law, he couldn't tell me my mom's name,

but he could tell me
her last known address which was here, so...

I understand, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I...

I was just about ready to head out.
I wish I could help you.

I don't think I can, though.
No, I totally understand.

I guess I just gotta
learn to leave the table.

Nina Simone.

That's right. Yeah, she's the best.

One of your favorites?
She is.

You got any others?
Uh, Peggy Lee, Ella, Lady Day.

Aretha.
Mmm. Oh, don't forget about Gladys.

Oh, Gladys the Baddest. My dad...

He was my own personal musicologist,
taught me everybody.

Like Little Richard, Marvin Gaye.

Marvin. We lost him when I was a kid.
'84.

Yeah. Yep.
You in music or something?

No. No, no, I'm a...

I write a little bit.
Really? Cool! Anything I know?

Uh... You know, no, probably not.

No? Anything I'd like?
No. No, probably not.

Struggling artist? I get it.
Ah...

Well, I guess we're all struggling
in one way or another, huh?

Ain't that the truth.

Listen, I'm sorry
I couldn't help you with your mom.

Yeah. Don't apologize.

Honestly, just being in the house
where she once lived makes me feel...

I don't know...
...more connected to her somehow.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Anyway, thanks.

Um, thank you. Yeah.
Oh.

Oops. Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas to you.
Thank you.

Wait, Ellie. Wait... Rachel!

Rachel, wait!

I have an idea.

Thing is, my neighbor's been living
here for years, and I was thinking she...

I feel the same way.

Well, that was quick.

What?

Uh, nothing. I'll explain later.

Listen, why don't I, um,
give you my phone number?

And then you can just text me tomorrow.

I'm sure I'll have spoken to her by then.
Oh, that would be great.

Actually, you know what? Um...

I think I might
just wait until she's back.

I'll wait in my car.
You sure? She might be a while.

I've come this far, so...
Okay.

Okay.
Yup.

Thanks.

Hey.
Hey.

What's up?

Are you hungry?
I was gonna grab a bite, if you're hungry.

Very cool.
Mmm-hmm.

So is this an old haunt or...
No.

I haven't been here in years, actually,

but my mom used to take me here a lot
when I was a kid.

She loved this place.
I can see why. It's nice.

Welcome to Trattoria Toscana.
Thank you.

I amÂ Vittorio.
May I share tonight's specials?

Sure. Thank you so much.

Ah, do you speak Italian?
Oh, yes.

Very good!

For the first course,
I recommend the pumpkin tortelli.

Mmm!

Next, I would suggest
a nice baked sea bass.

We prepare it very lightly with a drizzle
of olive oil, lemon, and rosemary.

Mmm!

Yes! Oh, no. No, no, no.

Uh, I'll take the pasta of the day.

Good.
Thank you.

Could you repeat in English?

No, no, it's... it's fine.
I'll just have whatever she's having.

Ah.
Oh, and a glass of wine, please.

Do you want one?
Uh, no, no.

You sure?

Two glasses
of classic Chianti please.

Very good.
Oh, uh, um...Â Separate checks?

Ah, but of course. Yes.
Thank you.

What's that last thing?
Oh, it's, um...

Separate checks. Yeah.
Separate checks?

You're a writer
and I just want to respect that.

Both of my parents are artists.
They make and sell their own jewelry.

So as you can imagine, it's, uh...

there have been times
when the bills have been challenging.

So I figure it's better to...

I'm sure you can understand
and appreciate that sometimes it's...

Thank you. I appreciate it. Nice of you.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

So you speak fluent Italian.
How'd that happen?

Well, actually,
I also speak French and German.

Little bit of Mandarin.

You speak a little Mandarin?
A bit.

I kid you not!

No, it's...
I'm a language major, so...

Got it. Cool. You don't hear that...
<i>- Grazie.</i>

Thank you very much.

Um, so how do you
while away the hours these days?

Actually, I just applied for a job
as a translator at the UN.

It's a long shot.
Long shot? Why is it a long shot?

Isn't everything?

Mm.

Um, sorry, I should take this.
Sure. No problem.

One second.
Sure.

I'll see you at the table, all right?
Welcome home, stranger!

Dion, hey! How are you?

Man, how long has it been?
It's been a while. 12th grade.

Yeah, you disappeared.
Where did you go to college, anyway?

You know, I didn't go. I ended up...
I went to Paris. School of life.

Oh, that's right.
You look exactly the same.

Only richer.

Ah...

Is it true they're turning
your new book into a movie?

I don't know.
I mean, this is what they say.

Hometown hero.
Thank you very much. You're very kind.

It's great seeing you, man.
Good to see you.

Sorry about that.

Where were we?
We were, um...

Potential job. UN. Long shot.

Yeah, it's...

I don't know, with this new job,
it could be challenging. I don't know.

We may have to move and it's just...
"We"?

Yeah, Alan and me.

And Alan is?
Oh, God, sorry. Alan's my fiancÃ©.

Oh, you're engaged?

Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

Hey, congratulations. I love love.

Great. Thank you.
Cheers. This is wonderful.

Um, we haven't set a date yet.

And Alan wants to,
but if I do get this job, then...

I don't... We'll just
have to figure it out, I guess.

Haven't even looked
for engagement rings yet.

Well, we went last week, and I don't know,
I couldn't pick anything.

So I just... we just left and then...

Actually, this was kind of cute.
On the walk home, he gave me this.

What's that?
It's...

Cigar ring.

Believe it or not,
this silly ring came as kind of a relief.

Yeah?
I'm not into all that

"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"
kind of stuff.

The truth is I'm kind of ambivalent
about the concept of being engaged.

Mmm-hmm.
One the one hand, I like the certainty,

but on the other, it makes you feel
kind of boxed in, you know?

Yeah, no, "boxed in" is something
I've managed to avoid my entire life.

In my case, it's tricky 'cause
Alan likes doing things by the book.

And it's important to respect
what the other person wants. Right?

Mmm-hmm.
But he's a tax attorney!

He's very, very good at his job,
and he's super precise.

Believe me, he'll be the one
planning our wedding

down to the very last place card.

It's gonna run like clockwork.

And the good thing is,
then I promise I'll shut up,

but I think, I don't know,
Alan and I complement one another.

And that's how it's...
It's supposed to be like that, right?

I mean, I'm not an expert on the subject,
but, yeah, that sounds about right.

Well, for better or worse, I am.

I don't know,
I think being adopted, I'm just...

I'm always trying
to fill some kind of void.

I'm always looking
for security and reliability,

and that's why I think if I find my real...
my birth mom, it's...

I don't know, it'll resolve this
huge uncertainty in my life and then...

I don't know.
You'll be free.

Yeah.
Come on.

Honestly, I really
would have been happy to split it.

Oh, come on.
No, it was my pleasure.

Good food, good company.

Huh.

That's a three-hour date.

I guess the universe
really does reward the brave.

I should probably
tackle another room.

Ah.

Hey, um, I was actually wondering,
do you think there's a...

there's a chance your parents
kept something of my mother's?

A card? A photo?

Anything?

Yeah. Okay.
Be careful now.

You got it? All right.
Yeah. Okay.

Plop it right here's fine.
Oh, God.

Is there a dead body inÂ there?
I'm afraid to look to be honest with you.

Hey, who played?
Huh?

Oh, my mom forced me
to take lessons when I was a kid.

At first, I pretty much hated it.
And then?

Then it made her
really happy to hear me play, so...

Will you play something for me?

Play something for you? Come on. No.
Seriously.

Seriously, I wanna see if the piano
sounds as beautiful as it looks.

Please?

All right. It's been a while,
so I'm probably a little rusty.

Hmm.

<i>â™ª 'Cause your mama's all alone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I have tried in vain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Never more to call your name â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you left, you broke my heart â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause I never thought we'd part â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Every hour in the day
You will hear me say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, won't you please come home? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Won't you please come home? â™ª</i>

Wow.

Ah! Young love.

Hi!
So how was the date?

It went well.

Just well?

It went very well.

Hmm!

This is my friend, Rachel.

Hi!
Hi, nice to meet you.

Rachel's got a question
I think maybe only you can answer<i>.</i>

Of course, I remember her.

She was a babysitter,
a live-in babysitter,

like, you know, like an au pair.

Right. Right, sure.

She was very young.
Seventeen, maybe 18 at the most.

She must have moved
before the baby was born.

Do you remember her name or...

Gosh, that's a good question.

Seems like it had something
to do with Christmas,

like, um, Christina or Joy.

I'm drawing a blank,
but you know who would know?

Who's that?
Your dad.

Oh. Oh, no.

No, I don't, um... No.

Well, anyway, he lives in Vermont now.

It's way up in the mountains
in a little town called Cornwall Bridge,

living pretty much off the grid.

How do you...
How do you know all that?

When I saw him at the funeral,
we had a nice long chat.

You know, I really don't think
there would be any harm in talking...

"Harm in talking"? No, there will be harm.

I haven't spoken to the guy in 35 years,
Ellie, come on.

No, I'm aware, but...

No, no, no. I'm... Excuse me.

Sorry. It's, uh...

Oh, Jacob.

Now you know why he stayed away so long.

It would be good for him
if he could get over it.

Rachel! Rachel, wait!
What?

Listen.
Yeah?

I know all that stuff in there
with my dad probably seemed irrational.

Oh, no, Jake, please.
You don't owe me any explanation, okay?

I'm just some stranger
who showed up on your doorstep.

You don't owe me anything.

You've already helped me, like, a lot.
So thank you. And...

I really hope you have a lovely...
a lovely Christmas.

You headed home?

Um...

No, I'm going to Cornwall Bridge.

I need to know if I ever mattered to her.
Maybe you've wondered that about your dad?

Truth is, if I ever saw him,
I wouldn't know what to say to him.

Well, maybe if you're up for a drive,

we could script a few lines.

Come on.

Hop on up.

You're leaving!
I guess it's, uh, time to head home?

Well, yes and no, actually.

How you doing? Jake Turner. Pleasure.
Oh, Ian Page. Pleased to meet you.

I'm a big fan of your work, really.
Oh, thank you.

I told Ian that you
basically wrote my profile.

Ah, well, you know,
she made me take out all the racy stuff.

Well, all's I can say
is meeting Eleanor

is the greatest Christmas surprise
I could ask for.

Aw.

Ian plays first violin
with the Hartford Symphony.

Is that right? That's impressive.

That's great.
Thanks, mate.

What did you mean when you
said you were leaving, "Yes and no"?

Yes, I'm leaving. No, I'm not going home.

Uh, Rachel's supposed to be...

Oh, there she is. Hey.
Hey.

She's convinced me... And you, uh...

I'm gonna go see my dad.

Jacob.

Good for you.

Well, the universe
rewards the brave, right?

You ready for this?

Absolutely not. You?

No.

Let's go.

<i>â™ª Sha la da la la â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Christmas time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sha la da la la â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Christmas time... â™ª</i>

Don't you think
Waze would be easier?

Yeah, of course it would.
But maps are so much nicer, it's like a...

tactile thing in a virtual world,
you know?

Yeah, I know. I had this idea...
I had this idea for a book about that.

A Stephen King thriller-type thing.
Yeah?

Yeah, yeah, so here's what I came up with.
There's this couple, right?

They're on their honeymoon.
Okay.

And they're in a rental car.

The GPS is, like, possessed or something,
or maybe the ex-boyfriend hacked into it.

That might be better, I'm not sure.
Anyway.

Whatever the case,
the GPS leads them into mortal danger.

You hate it. Bad? It's bad.

No, no, no!
You know, I like it. I like it.

But what happens next?

I mean, like,
after they're in mortal danger.

Yeah, I don't... That's as far as I got.
Never wrote it.

All right.
That's it.

Well, as my dad said,
"No creative idea's ever wasted."

So there you go.
I like that.

Okay, in three miles,
take I-91 North.

91 North. You got it.
Yup.

Alan always gets kind of
annoyed when I give him directions.

Really?
He says he doesn't need a co-pilot.

I could use
any navigational help I can get.

Speaking of Alan,

what's he think about this, um,
this job you applied for in New York?

Um, actually, I, uh...

He doesn't...
I haven't told him about it yet.

What's he think
about this trip to Cornwall Bridge?

Uh, he's not thrilled. He's not thrilled.

And actually he was kind of... peeved.

Yeah. No, let me guess, it's, uh...

He's upset that you are taking
a road trip with this guy you just met?

No, actually. No, it was, um...

It was about the... theÂ gas money.

No, it's just like
one of those little Alan quirks.

Okay.

It's no big deal, and inÂ the grand scheme
of things, it's meaningless, right?

I'm kind of insulted.
He's not concerned about me, right?

He's concerned about gas money.
Well, he doesn't know about you.

Oh.

As it turns out,
I didn't really know about you either.

What are you talking about?
I finally broke down and I Googled you.

Oh, come on.
And, honestly, I tried to put it off.

Because I really don't like
looking people up.

It always seems
like an intrusion, somehow.

Uh-huh.
But now... I'm really glad I did.

No.
'Cause now I know you're this,

like, super-famous,
best-selling novelist, so...

Uh, super famous
is a bit of a stretch, I think.

Well, um, five million copies sold...

It's like five and a half at this point,
but it's okay, who's counting?

And number one
on <i>The New York Times </i>Best Seller List.

I got lucky.
And, uh, translated into 30 languages.

I think that makes you super famous.
Oh.

Here was little old me worried
about how you were gonna pay for dinner.

Hey, do you mind grabbing my wallet?
It's in the backpack in the back there.

Sure.

Oh!

Thank you very much.
Mmm-hmm.

Jake, do you know what this is?

No. You know what? I just, uh...

That was in a box
marked "personal" at my mom's.

I just kinda picked it up,
and I didn't look at it. What is it?

Okay, listenÂ to this.

"My name is Noel Ellis."

<i>"I'm 17 years old, and I'm having a baby."</i>

This is my mother's diary.

I know it.

I know it.

Her name is Noel. I can't believe this.

I can't...
I just... I can't...

"My parents sent me away to have my baby."

"They're ashamed of me."

<i>And they're ashamed
of the child I'm bringing into this world.</i>

<i>And so, I'm leaving.</i>

"They truly believe it's wrong for a woman
to have a child outside of marriage."

"'God disapproves, ' they say."

<i>But doesn't God
forgive our mistakes?</i>

<i>Everyone I know and trust
has abandoned me.</i>

"Thankfully, this really kind family
hired me as their nanny."

<i>The Turners are a family of four.</i>

<i>"Scott and Lois and
their little boys, Benjamin and Jacob."</i>

<i>Benji's seven
and has loads of energy.</i>

<i>Jake is four, and he's the quiet one.</i>

Do you have any memory of that?
I know you were little, but...

I really don't.

<i>He likes me to read
the </i>Magic Tree House<i> books to him.</i>

So where's Ben now?

Oh, there was this, um,

snowstorm. It was around Christmas.

We had...

We had this giant elm tree
in our front yard.

Benji loved to climb
and he was in that tree all the time.

And that night,

Ben decided he was gonna climb
as high as he could in that tree.

And hang his favorite ornament...

<i>â™ª Don't know why â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather... â™ª</i>

Sorry about earlier, I got so emotional
talking about my brother.

No, it's...

You don't need to apologize. I understand.

Thanks.

It's been over 30 years, you know?
You'd think I'd be able to...

talk about it.

You know that saying,
"Time heals all wounds"?

Mmm.

It doesn't.

<i>It's been two months now,</i>

<i>and I still haven't heard a word
from either of my parents or Peter.</i>

<i>"One day in my room,
I just couldn't stop crying..."</i>

<i>And there was
this quiet knock on the door.</i>

"And little Jacob came in."

<i>He laid his head on my shoulder,
and it was as if he understood.</i>

<i>I love that kid more and more every day.</i>

<i>I know you're not supposed
to have favorites, but...</i>

One New York, rare,

and one vegetarian plate, no peppers,
no carrots, no onions, sauce on the side.

Thank you. Perfect.

Hey, can I ask you a question?
Can I stop you?

No.

Why is it that a handsome,
successful guy like you is still single?

Handsome?
Don't deflect.

Uh...

I like to be alone, I guess, you know?
Hmm. Safer that way. I get it.

But you're engaged.

Still, there's always that,
like, push-pull thing, you know?

Mmm.
"Come closer."

"I want to be alone." You know?
Mmm-hmm.

I mean, I've had relationships
in the past, don't get me wrong.

I've had serious relationships
in the past, a few of them anyway, but...

You know, in the end, they all just, uh...

In the end, I just wasn't
what they were looking for, you know?

Maybe they weren't
what you were looking for.

Uh, question.

What are the odds of us making it
through the pass before the storm hits?

Tonight?
Yeah.

Ooh, I'd say about...

zero.

Percent?
Percent.

Why don't you check us in?
I think Ava needs to stretch her legs.

Sure! Meet you back here in 20?
Yeah.

All right.

Hey!

<i>Hey, stranger.</i>

<i>Look, I, uh, I wanted
to apologize for the other night.</i>

<i>I know this stuff with your mom,
trying to find her...</i>

No, no, no, Alan. Don't worry.
Don't worry. It's fine.

<i>Uh, so, listen,
on a forward-thinking note,</i>

<i>I had an idea for our engagement party.</i>

Yeah?

<i>Yeah, you know that Mexican restaurant
you love, Casa Frida?</i>

Uh-huh.
<i>- So it's available Valentine's Day,</i>

<i>which is perfect
for an engagement party, right?</i>

<i>Plus, they are giving us
a phenomenal price.</i>

Oh, that sounds great.

<i>Yeah?</i>

<i>So my plan is give them a deposit
first thing tomorrow morning.</i>

Alan, can we just...

Can we just wait on Casa Frida?

Till I get back.

<i>Of course, babe. Yeah. Whatever you want.</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>- When are you back?</i>
Soon.

<i>Okay. Love you.</i>

I love you too.

You're in luck! Got two rooms left.

Great! Terrific.

You know, if this were a rom-com,
you'd have one room left.

We'd have to share it.

Rom-com?

Romantic comedy, rom-com.

Oh, right!
Yeah.

Well, if it helps,

the rooms are connected.

Okay, I'm sorry, you're closing.

I was gonna head to the pageant,
but it can wait.

How can I help?

I was wondering
if you had any books by Jacob Turner?

Of course!
How far along are you in the series?

Uh... I'm at the beginning, so I don't know.

Okay! You want Book One,
<i>Green Eyes of Paris.Â </i>We should have that.

Great! So what's it about?

Paris in the '40s.

The French Resistance,
espionage, forbidden love.

Oh, wow. Sounds pretty...

Riveting, right? And trust me, it is.

The world this guy creates,

it's like you're actually there
with his characters.

It's what makes the book so absorbing.

That's probably why I have
such a hard time

keeping them on the shelves.

Ah! Look at that, you're in luck.

Thanks.

Not bad.

Yeah, and he writes
almost as good as he looks.

Hey.
Hey.

So, what do you think?
Should we call it a night,Â or...

"Or." Definitely "or."

Yeah! Yeah, yeah, come on.

Merry Christmas!

There you are.
Thank you.

Look at this.
Look at this! Hi! So cute.

You better knock it off.
She'll get jealous.

Incredible.
I love it here.

How are you?
Hi!

Do you mind if we have...
Absolutely.

Thank you! You're giving these away?
On the house.

Thank you!
It's my favorite town.

Smells great.
Happy holidays.

Oh, wow, look at that!
I haven't seen this film in years.

I've never seen it.
You're kidding. You're in for a treat.

Excuse me, are you two together?

Oh, no.

Yeah? Well, yeah. We were, you know...

Maybe we are.

Smooth.

You okay?

<i>I'm shakin' the dust of this
crummy little town off my feet</i>

<i>and I'm gonna see the world!</i>

<i>Italy, Greece...</i>

Wow! That may be
the best movie I've ever seen.

<i>He wondered if this journey
was about to take an unexpected turn.</i>

Oh, my God. No way.

Everything okay in there?

Hi.
<i>- </i>Hi.

Yeah, I'm fine.

Great.

I just... I heard... I thought I heard a...
Oh, yeah, no.

Thanks for checking, though.
Appreciate it.

Okay. Just, uh...
Well, just have a...

Good night.
Good night.

No way!

Oh!

How'd you sleep?

Um...

Actually,
I was up last night reading.

Anything interesting?
Uh, yeah, very.

Yeah?
<i>- Green Eyes of Paris.</i>

You know that one?
I've heard of it. You...

You bought my book
and you didn't tell me?

Yeah, well, I didn't...

I didn't wanna tell you just in case...
Just in case what?

In case I didn't like it.

In case you didn't like it?
Yeah.

And?

Well...

No, it's okay. You can tell me. It's fine.
My ego is, uh...

I think I can handle it.

What's up? What did you think?
Okay, well, um...

You know, I find it interesting...
Yeah.

...that you write these novels
filled with suspense, and drama, romance,

and yet your main character, Henri,

he never lets anyone get close to him.

It's kinda like what we were
talking about last night.

Henri lives inÂ occupied France, right?
He can't trust anybody.

Well, yeah, but...

This isn't occupied America.
So what's your excuse?

On the other hand...

um...

I really loved the book.
Yeah?

I loved it! It was just...

God, the ending?

That was...

It kind of blew me away.

Good. Good, good, good.

The endings are, uh... ending, it's...

They're always hard to get right,
you know. Yeah.

Any thoughts on the current story?
You gonnaÂ get that ending right?

<i>I found out today
I'm having a girl,</i>

<i>a sweet, little baby girl.</i>

<i>Before I left home, my parents
told me not to name my baby.</i>

"Because it would
only make it harder to say goodbye."

"But I've already...Â given her a name."

<i>My angel.</i>

Um, can you pull over? I... I need...
I need some air.

You sure? It's freezing outside.
Yeah, please.

Okay. Sure.

Hey. Come on.

Ah! It's freezing out here. Here you go.

You all right?

Why would she leave it behind?

Why go through the trouble
of writing everything down

and documenting all these details
if she wasn't...

if she was just gonna abandon it?

I don't know.

You know, maybe she thought it would
find its way back to you, eventually?

Or maybe she just
wanted to forget everything.

Like it never existed.

Like I never existed.
No.

I'm supposed to be engaged.
I'm supposed to be getting married.

Oh, no! What are you... No, wait!

Come on! where are you... No!
Ava? Ava!

Ava!

Ava, no!

Ava Turner,
get back here right now!

What were you gonna do if you caught it?
Yeah.

That was incredible.

Guess life's all about the chase,
huh, Turner?

I think we took a wrong turn.

You mean you hope we took a wrong turn?
Exactly.

Please tell me
the universe really does reward the brave.

You got this.

Here we go.

<i>It was a day
he had both been anticipating...</i>

<i>and dreading.</i>

Jacob.

You know, Eleanor called
to say you might be coming.

I told her I didn't believe it,

but she said over and over again,
"Just be prepared."

Are you?

Yeah! I...

I'm cutting down
this Christmas tree for you.

I've only been waiting for this moment
for 30-odd years,Â and now that it's here...

Yeah.

Same.

Mind giving me a hand?

Plus, if it's just you,
what's the point, right?

Yeah, well, if it's any
consolation, I've never had a tree,

so you're ahead of me.

All right.
Welcome to my humble abode.

Here we go.

Now just set this end down here.
Yeah.

Can you tip it up?

Gotta get the stand.
All right.

You live out here all alone?
I do!

All right.
Ellie painted that, right?

Good eye. Yeah, that's hers.

All right.

I think that should do it.
Yeah?

Look at that.
Good job.

Oh. Excuse me.

Scott Turner. Hello?

Yes.

See you then.

Sorry about that.

That was, uh, one of my clients.

Your clients? What do you do?
I'm a social worker at the VA.

Social, you're trying
to do some good in the world?

Underline "trying."

You know, I bought these
forever ago when I first moved in,

and I never even took them out of the box.

Think they still work?

I don't know.

Jake...

I know an apology doesn't mean
a whole lot after all these years...

You know what? It's...

You can save it.

I didn't come out here for a, uh,
you know, reconciliation.

I'm only here to help a friend, honestly.

A friend?
Yeah, a friend. It's a long story.

Well, since you're here, can I at least
say what I've been waiting...

I'd, I'd... I'd really rather you didn't.

I am sorry.

You're sorry.

I am deeply, deeply sorry.

Yeah. Good.

Good. So we're all set then.

You know, um,

you left me alone with Mom,

and then you run up here,
and you just disappear altogether...

And you're sorry?

God! I said I wasn't gonna do this.

Uh, you know what?
This was a mistake. I can't do this.

Jake!
Enjoy your tree.

Hey!
No, I can't handle this.

I thought this was a good idea. Let's go.
What?

Wait, just take a breath, okay?
Take a breath.

You know, if you walk away now,
that's it, right?

It's over. Forever.

Well, it's been over for 35 years...
Stop! Jake.

If you leave now,

you are doing exactly what he did.

Right?

Why don't you just try being the first
adult in your family not to take the exit?

Please.

Jake,
it's just so hard to talk about...

but two days before Christmas,

we had the biggest snowstorm
of the winter.

<i>And Benji, like every year,</i>

<i>couldn't wait
to hang his favorite ornament</i>

<i>high up in the branches
of our old elm tree.</i>

<i>He'd climbed up so many times to
that platform that I'd built for you guys.</i>

Oh!

<i>I knew the branches
could be slippery...</i>

<i>but he was such a determined little guy.</i>

<i>I thought,
"I'll just let him hang the ornament."</i>

<i>The sound of that branch
cracking will never leave me.</i>

<i>I was Benji's father.</i>

<i>I should have stopped him.</i>

The following April,

<i>I cut down that tree.</i>

It didn't help at all.

And after Noel left,

your mom and I just...

couldn't comfort each other anymore.

And it got to the point
where one of us had to leave.

I wanted to take you with me,

but I just couldn't do that to her.

You were all she had left.

I told myself that with you there,

somehow she'd find her way back.

You know, you used to love
stringing the lights when you were little.

You remember?

So, tell me, be honest,

do you think we should go in
or just let them be?

Okay, I guess we'll let them be.
Okay. I heard you.

You know, I tried to stay in touch.

At first, I called. Left messages for you.
For years, I wrote letters to you.

I've never seen a letter or a message.
Mom never told me.

So are you married?
Married? No, I'm not. No.

I read your first couple of books.

But my eyesight's not what it was,
so I listened to the third one on audio.

I mean, it's the first time
I got to hear your adult voice.

It was fantastic.

I love 'em.

Oh, I remember.

I think Benji called you a butterfingers...

<i>â™ª Where the love light gleams... â™ª</i>

That's beautiful.

Here's hoping.

<i>â™ª If only in my dreams... â™ª</i>

There you go.

<i>â™ª I'll be home for Christmas... â™ª</i>

Success!

Didn't you say
you came here to help a friend?

<i>â™ª My dreams â™ª</i>

Hey. How's the weather?

It's chili!

Here it comes.

Excuse me, girl. This is not for you.

Noel was a godsend.

After we lost Jacob's brother,

she was the glue that kept us
from completely coming apart.

Here you go.
Oh, thank you.

Now, bear with me.

I've been making
this chili for myself for 35 years,

so I have no idea
if it's safe for public consumption.

Smells good. I'll tell you that.
All right, son, here you go.

Mmm.

Oh, it's more than safe.
It's really good. Thank you.

Mmm. That's great.
It's really great.

Fantastic.

So would you happen to know

where Noel moved
or where she might live now?

Oh...

You know, she sent me
something years ago. Hold on.

Really?
Excuse me, baby.

What do you think?

Um, you have his eyes.

Really?

Yeah.

It's a good thing.

Well...

I, uh... Sorry.

I always held on to this.
Don't ask me why.

Uh...

It says she's gonna be living with her
husband, Charles Hayden, in Ridgefield.

Noel Hayden.

I gotta say it.
You two would make a fantastic couple.

No, no, Rachel's engaged.
Yeah.

Really?
Yeah, big time.

Congratulations.
Thank you.

He must be a great guy
because you are one heck of a catch.

That she is.
Okay.

So, you'll let me know
how everything turns out?

Oh, of course. Of course.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

You're welcome, sweetheart.

Wish me luck.

Best of luck.
Thanks.

I, uh...

Thanks for wearing that watch, son.
Oh.

I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

Yeah, come on. Come on.

You grew up good.

Real good.

Well, um, stay in touch.

A hundred percent.
Okay.

You okay?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you.

Yeah.

<i>Today, my sweet baby girl was born.</i>

<i>And I know I will never see her again.</i>

"So I'm gonna leave this diary behind."

"Maybe someday she'll read it
and understand how much I love her."

<i>And always will.</i>

"And always will."

God, I hope that's true...

...what she said about loving me.

So I was thinking about Noel.

Should I call her first, or do you think
I should just show up tomorrow?

What do you... what do you think?
Hmm.

I think get some sleep
and decide in the morning.

Yeah.

Like I'm gonna sleep.

Um, let me just
triple check to make sure.

Oh, gosh, I'm sorry,
but we only have one room available.

Oh, no, uh...
We'll take it.

We'll take it?

Yeah, we'll...

You know, we'll take it.
Great.

Thank you.

So...

Um...

I have a confession to make.

Confession?
Yep.

Uh-oh! What'd she do?

Today is my birthday.

No!
Yeah.

Today's your birthday?
Yeah.

You're kidding.
You're just now telling me this? This is...

What? You should have said something.
Yeah.

This is a big deal.
You should've said something.

You know, you, uh, we can...
You know, it's a birthday. These are...

What are you doing?
We're gonna celebrate your birthday!

Hi! This is Jake Turner
from the Amber Suite.

I was wondering if...

Yeah, that Jake Turner. I...
Thank you. I appreciate it.

Listen, I was wondering
if you could do me a favor?

I've got a
birthday girl up here. I just found out.

I know it's late notice,
but do you have a birthday cake

or something,
a dessert you can put candles in?

You do? Terrific.

Uh, you know what? Yes, more red wine.

And you might as well send up
some champagne too

because it's a birthday,
champagne is for celebrating.

Wonderful. Thank you very much.

You wanna dance?
Really?

Yeah.

Really?
Yeah, come on. It's my birthday.

It's your birthday. You're right. Okay.

<i>â™ª Merry Christmas, darling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And a happy New Year, too â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I am so happy just being here with you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Your present, I will cherish â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The wonderful gift of you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Moonlight is shining â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Snow is falling down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Here we are together â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª True love we have found â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Darling, let's make a resolution â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not for just a new year â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But for a lifetime â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let's always be together â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come what might â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And, darling... â™ª</i>

Happy birthday, Rachel.

Make a wish.

<i>â™ª Merry Christmas, darling â™ª</i>

Way ahead of you.

<i>â™ª I am so happy â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just being here with you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I give you my present â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I love you â™ª</i>

<i>Dear Jake.</i>

<i>First of all, I want you to know
that last night was beautiful.</i>

<i>And I'd be lying if I didn't admit</i>

<i>that I've been thinking about it
since the moment we met.</i>

<i>But I woke up in the middle of the night
feeling confused.</i>

<i>Really, really confused.</i>

<i>And the thing is Alan really loves me,</i>

<i>and that's not nothing.</i>

<i>And you have a very different life</i>

<i>with best-selling books,
and a million Instagram followers,</i>

<i>and I'm...</i>

<i>just getting launched,</i>

<i>which I totally understand,
at least to the extent that I can.</i>

<i>It's just that I'm a person who needs
a lot of certainty in their life.</i>

<i>And this time with you,
wonderful though it was,</i>

<i>it isn't that.</i>

<i>So I think it's better
that we part company now</i>

<i>before it's too late,</i>

<i>at least for me.</i>

<i>And I realized something else,</i>

<i>thanks to you.</i>

<i>My whole life,
I thought my mother didn't want me</i>

<i>and that I needed
to find her and ask her why.</i>

<i>But now that I've read her diary,
I know that she did truly love me,</i>

<i>and that's all that really matters.</i>

<i>Thank you for everything,</i>

<i>for going on this wild,
life-changing ride with me.</i>

<i>I'll never, ever forget it.</i>

<i>And, lastly,</i>

<i>I'll never, ever forget you.</i>

Pardon me, the, uh, nurses' station?
Um, down the hall, to the right.

To the right. Thank you.
Welcome.

Excuse me. Hi, can you tell me
where to find Noel Hayden?

Hi, I'm Noel.

I called your house,
your husband told me where to find you.

I don't know if you remember me or not,
but, um...

I'm Jacob Turner.

Jacob?

Wow.

How are your folks?

Uh, my folks? My, um...

My mom just recently passed away.

Oh.

I'm so sorry.
Thank you. Yeah, it was very sudden.

But your dad, he's...
He's good.

He's, um...

Yeah, I just saw him for the first time
in a really long time, actually.

He's... He's good. He's hanging in.

Like the rest of us.

Like the rest of us, yeah.

Um...

You gotta be wondering
why I'm here after all these years.

It's a really long,
complicated story, but...

Noel,

when my brother died,

I didn't realize until just recently
how much you helped my family,

how much you helped me.

You were just a little kid, Jake.
But if you hadn't been there...

But I was.

And you got through it.

Now that I'm here, I can say thank you.

Now that you're here,

you're welcome.

There's one other thing I wanted
to talk to you about before I left, um...

The child that you had, your daughter.

Rachel.

She's...

wonderful, she's amazing.

I wanted you to know that.

You know her?

I do know her, um...

Yeah, she wanted to come here,
she wanted to meet you in person.

And I think, you know, after...
after reading this...

she felt a connection for sure, and, uh...

she understands everything.

Everything.

Thank you for telling me that.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas, Jacob.

And thank you for this.

It's a precious gift.

And, Jake...

if you see my daughter,

would you tell her that
if she ever wants to get in touch,

I would like that very much.

Rachel.

Your dad's been
working on this since Thanksgiving.

I can't wait to see it.

I think it's the most beautiful
he's ever done.

Yeah?

Uh, when will Alan be coming?

Uh, soon. Soon.

You don't sound too excited, honey.
Well, I am, I just...

I don't know, "excited" is a bit...
a strong word.

I couldn't get it right until
finally last night at, like, 2:00 a.m.

No, you got it right, Dad.
This is... It's perfect.

I love it. This is...
It's perfect. Thank you.

Honey, you don't want to talk to Alan?

No, no, it's not that.
It's just that I don't, um...

I don't know.
Things are... We'll talk later, and it's...

We're sorting things...
sorting some things out right now.

"Sorting some things out"?
I thought you guys made up.

No, we... We did, we just...

You know, things are a little
up in the air right now.

This is starting to sound
a little like that cigar engagement ring.

Dad, stop. Seriously.

Um, sorry, guys, one sec.
I'll be right back.

Jake, you've gotta stop calling.

<i>No, I'm not gonna
stop calling until we talk.</i>

I don't want to do this.

Okay? I...

So I'm gonna just hang up the phone now.

Please don't try to find me, okay?

Too late.

Why are you doing this?

Do you really have to ask?

I'm not coming out.

I'm not. I can't.

Why? Why not? What are you...
What are you afraid of?

What's gonna happen?

Jake, you don't understand.

You don't. I have finally found something...

that I can really...

I can really count on, and...

It may not be perfect,
but it's what I want.

It's what I need.

Okay?

So I need you to understand that.

I do understand.
I understand the whole thing.

I understand that...

what you may have needed before,
you don't need anymore.

Look at me, I...

All I wanted my entire life
was to be alone.

And it's hard for people like us
to trust, right?

To let people in.

It's hard. I understand that.
But here I am, right here, right now.

And I am standing here with the
only friend I have in the entire world.

I'm staring at the woman that I love,

and I'm begging you to trust me.

I'm telling you, you can trust me.

Just let me in, please.

Let me in.

Tell me

you don't love me.

Jake, that's Alan. You gotta go.

You tell me that you don't love me
and I'll go.

I don't love you.

<i>â™ª Ribbons and bows
Are scattered on the floor â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Comes and it goes by so fast â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The joy of the season â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Spirit with feeling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There must be a way to make it last â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So let's make a promise
For the rest of the year â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And even when we'll fall apart â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Keep Christmas in your heart â™ª</i>

Saw your truck, thought we'd
pop by and wish you Merry Christmas.

Oh, thank you.

Yes, I was packing up a few things,

then I need to lock up,
and then take off, so...

Would you care to join us for dinner?
We'd love to have you.

We really would.
We're having a few people over.

It's Christmas dinner, all the trimmings.

I would, I would love to, and thank you,

but I should take off
before the roads get too slick.

How did things go with your father?

Um, you know, they...

Better than expected.
Much better, actually.

I told you.
You did.

And Rachel and her mom?

I think that's gonna work itself out.

That's very good news. Excellent.

Oh, bloody hell,
I've gotta go baste the ham.

You sure you can't stay?

Well, Happy Christmas, old boy.

Happy basting.
I'll be right there.

Come on in.

And you and Rachel?

Oh, um...

No? Really? I was so sure.

Well, Kerouac said it.

"It all ends in tears, anyway."

But I'll be okay,
and Rachel will be okay too.

Of course.

Merry Christmas.

For me?

What did you do here?

Oh, Ellie...

You put the...

tree back in.

Yes.

I have wonderful memories of this house.

You and Benji playing in the yard.

Your folks.

Merry Christmas.

Take care.
Oh, you too. Take care of yourself too.

And thank you. This is just...
You're special.

<i>â™ª I don't want my holidays â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Has a big, ol' little tree â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Strangers pass you by â™ª</i>
