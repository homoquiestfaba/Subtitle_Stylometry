[disconcerting sounds]

People say God made the world.

I never believed that God or a
Devil had power over our lives.

I used to believe that
we are our own Gods

and Goddesses and
we decide our future...

but I was wrong.

I thought if you put visions out
there the universe answers back.

[ominous music]

I'm calling you because...

you were right

put something out there and...

something answered back.

It's not what...

Oh big time just please don't
come back ok? Just be safe.



Amy...

What's wrong?

I just can't go through with
this, I'm out.

Come inside.

Open yourself to the spirits...

now.

Take a card from the deck.

Are you serious, what does this
mean?

The Devil card means a trap, a
trap you face and must avoid.

Just focus in on the other six.

I'm sorry I can't do this, I
just...

Amy!

I can't.

You came to me for direction
this is it.

Don't lose your edge, stay
strong.

You're wet, take your clothes
off.

I'll dry them.

I'll be right back.

[ethereal whispering]

Lavender incense, it's good for
relaxing.

Come.

[soft rhythmic music]

Couldn't sleep again last night.

I saw her again.

[woman shushing]

Let's clear your chi.

[speaking in foreign language]

You're an open vessel

for great power.

You're destiny is before you.

[foreign language]

[foreign language]

[disconcerting sounds]

[foreign language]

Liz.

Amy, relax.

Yea, I saw here the woman in the
black.

I told you,
you need to learn to control

your stress level and
balance your energy.

[Liz breathing in]

Slow deep breaths...

[Liz speaking foreign language]

After my mom died

it's like the universal energy
sent you to me.

I don't know why more
people don't do this.

I mean there's tarot cards,
spirit boards, Reiki...

Because people would rather

complicate their
lives with a concept

of a God and create rules they
can feel guilty about breaking.

So then they can come and pay

life coach like
me. Set them free.

That is herbal tea to help you
stay relaxed.

This I was going to give
this to your tomorrow

before you left but
since you're here now...

I had this made
with very special

crystals inside just for you.

Don't wear it until you get
there.

Put it on before you meditate.

I put a new mantra in there
for you use it when you work

your vision board and put all
six of your competitors on it.

Now...

put it out into the universe!

I'm gonna win the American
Dream.

You're gonna be a reality show
star.

[upbeat action music, cheering]

Welcome back to

American Dream,
we're down to our

last two multi-talented final...

Wait a minute,
wait a minute, stop,

just cut, cut,
wait just a second.

What on earth is going on here?
You're scrolling way too fast.

Maybe your brain is too slow.

And maybe if your daddy had some
juice you'd be the producer.

Listen you two that's
enough or you'll both

be moving fast on
the unemployment line.

We have a hard out so one more
time, ok?

Oh, and nobody yells cut except
me, you got it?

Yea, I got it.

Hold on.

Thank you baby.

Alright, settle settle, American
Dream closing, take three.

Action.

Welcome back to American Dream,
we're down

to our last two
finalists for this season.

And now here's a song
from out last American

Dream winner.
Beautiful Taylor Young!

[soft music]

â™ª You came and you left â™ª

â™ª Just like a midnight dream â™ª

â™ª And you didn't
even stop to hear â™ª

â™ª Me cry â™ª

â™ª Now I stand alone â™ª

â™ª And maybe just maybe
my heart will turn to stone â™ª

â™ª I'm nobody's baby â™ª

â™ª Ta da da da da da â™ª

â™ª I'm no nobody's baby â™ª

â™ª How could you go for someone
you didn't want anyway â™ª

Da da da da.

â™ª How could you
say all the loving â™ª

â™ª Things you never
meant to say â™ª

â™ª Heyyy â™ª

Da da da da,

â™ª Heyyy â™ª

Da da da da.

â™ª You're no nobody's baby â™ª


Thank you, thank you,
American Dream,

you've made my dreams come true.

You go girl,
I heard you over there singing.

I like when you went
da da da da da da boom!

Da da da da.

Thank you, thank you, Snoop.
You have

no idea what a big
fan of yours I am.

Now it's time to see
who on this stage tonight

will be named our new
American Dream winner.

They'll win a
million dollars and

return to the season's end,
to sing and

compete with Taylor
and our other American

Dream stars for
the ultimate prizes.

We're down to our last two
finalists. Alex and Charlie

are tied with one vote each.

It's now up to a one of a kind,
the amazing Doggfather.

Snoop, your vote is gonna bring
it on home.

Who's gonna be are new American

Dream winner
tonight on this stage?

Well uh keepin' it real...

and true to who I am...

doing my own thing and creating
my own rules.

I am going to vote for the
lovely...

Danielle.

Sorry Snoop but you can't vote
for one of the judges.

Ok, ok, ok, seriously, Danielle

I got my right eye
on you though.

In case you didn't
notice I have dabbled in

the music industry a little bit.
In that field.

So with that being said,
Alex, your

singing and dancing
were "exenious".

Thank you.

Even though Charlie
you was kicking it, I can't

ignore Alex's golden God
given one of a kind voice.

[hip-hp tones]

So my vote goes for.

Alex.

Oh my God I won! I won American
Dream!

Oh my... I won.

Thank you so much,
Snoop Dogg, oh my God

thank you so much.
This has been my dream.

Congratulate...

I am speechless but I just
wanted to say thank you so

much to my parents, thank you
so much for everything and...

Listen, tell them when you get
home. Ok?

Ok.

Congratulations, Alex, you are
the new American Dream winner!

And you have just won a prize of
one million dollars.

Alright, listen,
ladies and gentlemen be sure

to watch us next as seven
gorgeous multitalented

starlets enter our
pageant which tests their

skills to the max for
a million dollars on!

[host and Alex]
American Dream!


Cut! That's a wrap.

I really won a million dollars?

Yes.
Oh my God.

On time at Barry's house with
the starlets.

Smile for the camera princess.

That's invasion of privacy.

It's called behind the scenes
footage.

Get out of my face!

I am starving right now.

Biscuits and gravy with
smothered pototoes

You know
what I'm talking about?

Yea, something like that that
there.

Hi, excuse me, Mr. Dogg.

I'm Tony, PA.

I love your new gospel album,
I am, we are

your biggest fans.
Would you mind if we?

You all wanna get a selfie?

Yes, please.

Get in where you fit in.
Thank you.

Come on man.
Get up in here dog.

Big smiles fellas.

Mary, put your phone down.
You're needed in make-up.

You two know the rules about
taking photos with the stars.

Observe closely
in the tumultuous

waters of Hollywood as the big

director fish devours the little
production assistant minnow.

You're fired! Go! Go.

Sam, we good man, we all good
man they just kids.

Our fans deserve some respect.

Hey Sam, if they go I go.

Seriously?

Yea, you lose them. You lose us.

Now watch as the bigger star
fishes devour the director.

Seriously? What was that all
about?

Must be that time of the month
for him.

Maybe.

So bad. Did they even get the
picture?

So I thought about it and
if it's ok with you it's ok

with me, but I assure you
it won't happen again. Ever.

You two, you're needed in my
office.

Now!

Thanks, Sammy.

Let's roll y'all.

You just got the peace sign.
The peace sign, yea.

Thus, the Hollywood circle of
life.

[smooth jazzy music]

Welcome to another day on a
cheesy reality show.

Is that joint?

Nobody uses drugs on my set.

I mean it's legal so...

Yea but you're stupid enough
without using drugs.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Whoa. You two go... do
something.

I hired you to put the drama in

front of the camera.
What's the prob?

The problem
Barry is that I can't

have my guys on set doing drugs.

It effects their minds and they
screw up.

Come on Sam, let's be
professional here.

Besides, Carl's my go to guy.
I need

supplies when the girls
show up at the house.

â™ª Feeling sexy then show me â™ª

Hey, what's up?

Best season ever baby, best
season ever.

I need to find another
profession.

What's up baby? How you doing?

Lookin' good.

Hey, boss. How many scripts do
you want for tomorrow?

Make it an even 20.

Great.

Sir, your wife called again, she
says it's important.

Call her back
and tell her I will

be in editing
until late tonight.

I thought our editor just went
home.

I'm sorry boss he's new.

Yea, I can tell. Shall we?

Yea.
Let's.

Major rule, never tell the

producer's wife
where the producer

really is. They don't teach
you this in film school.

Alright, alright I got it, I got
that too. Don't ask guest stars

for photos and
try not to act like

a human being
while you're at it.

Also why do we need
20 copies of a script

for behind the scenes
of a reality TV show?

Because genius there is no
reality in reality TV.

What? Whatever.

Hey Carl, let's go drink.

You coming?

Oh no I gotta pass on that
tonight, Leslie's making dinner.

So I'll just meet
you guys at Barry's

house tomorrow for the diva's.

You guys seen the head shots of
the new cast?

[cable guy]
To get at any one of them.

Splendid relationship, may
as well be blind to the opposite

sex. Besides you know Barry
gets the first pick anyway.

Yea, what?
Does the producer get some

special permit to hit
on anybody he wants?

Man just grow a
pair and deal with it.

The guy signs your paychecks.
What else do you want?

I want the chicks man.

That's way above your pay grade.

[camera guy]
Oh... I wouldn't mind

hitting that.

[cable guy]
Careful what you say

on candid camera boys.

Wait, hey, Carl is that thing
still on?

Have you been recording this
whole time?

Listen ass-clown
if you don't delete

what I said I'm
going to kill you.

Hey man this is gold.

[ominous sounds]

So David triumphed
over the Philistines

with just a sling and stone.

Without a sword David defeated

the giant Goliath
and killed him.

Ok, kids that's all for tonight.

We're gonna be late next class.

You're gonna be late? Ok, that's

fine.
Jessica, you forgot your bible.

Thanks.

Bye, Crystal, see you later.

So David was a kid like me and
slew a giant? That's awesome.

He was like a superhero.

Oh, Chris. Superheros belong in
comic books.

But they have like superpowers.

Well supernatural powers, not
superpowers.

Ok, what's the difference?

Well...

Jesus wasn't a
mutant and King David

wasn't bitten by
a radio active bug.

He was given power by God to win
that battle with Goliath.

Now not all of us are
called to slay giants

or even save the
world and we need to be

content living safe
normal lives and give

glory to God and the
small things we do.

C'mon Pat, c'mon kiddos let's
go.

Bye Ms. Crystal.

Bye, see you in two weeks.

You're chariot awaits my lady.

Ooh, ok.

Hey, there is one
adventurous thing you

should do while living
your safe normal life.

Really? What is that?

Just say yes.

we can start raising
some little aspiring

super heroes of our own.
You know I love you.

â™ª It's so hard to be wise â™ª

â™ª When I look in your eyes â™ª

Josh, I don't wanna keep going
over this.

I just need more time.

If we make...

If we make it to the next step.
I want it...

I wanna make sure it'll be
right.

It'll be forever.

Honestly Crystal, I'll
love you forever but I can't

wait forever while you
try to make up your mind.

Yea, no, no, she's great

I saw her audition tape.

Yea, send it over. Perfect.

Yea, this is gonna be the best
season ever. Guaranteed. Yea.

Girls are here in 15.

Honey, can you do
something about the bags

under my eyes?
They're starting to show again.

Why don't you get some sleep at

night instead of
whatever you do?

This is the most
difficult cast of

diva's I've ever
had to deal with.

Barry,
I'm telling you I'm this close.

I'm this close
Barry to quitting!

Dominic, Dominic cool your
engines man.

C'mon.

They haven't even arrived yet.

Have you seen this list?
Two are vegan, one

vegetarian, one paleo,
three of them only gluten free.

Gluten free!

How am I supposed to cook food
for people who can't eat food?

Their requested menu items have
no food in the food.

You just get me
through this last season,

I'll give you your
own cooking show.

My own show?

And you can use all the gluten
you want.

You want a latte?

Sounds great.

That's the spirit.

Byron, where are you?

Hey, what are you doing? Let's
go, work.

[light upbeat music]

In this life there is spiritual

warfare.

If we're strong we stand against
it.

Don't turn off the car, I wanna
hear this.

So as we grow to know

God's truth and what is real.

We also know more of what
is false and we're stronger

to stand against it in the
powerful name of Jesus.

He never leaves us defense...


[ominous, demonic sounds]

...selves in a dark world.

Hey babe.

Did you hear that?

Hear what?

There was a lot of static and
then this weird sounding voice.

Yea, there's a lot of bad
reception out there.

No, seriously... angry almost
demonic voice.

Look, I even got goosebumps
listening.

Yea, that's just my animal
magnetism.

Maybe we should just go home.

So you think a demon just came
on the radio to go home?

There's a spiritual battle going
on everywhere.

Ever since Lucifer
fell from grace

and signs from
God are everywhere.

Seriously Josh, we may be from

the same religion
but sometimes I

wonder if we're
just too different

in our beliefs to get married.

But I have a bumper sticker
saying pray.

Just have a bad feeling about
this.

I think God is trying to tell me
something.

Yea well little Ms. Play It Safe
you're taking a chance for once.

Entering an incredible
contest which

could win us a million dollars.

I think it's just butterflies in

that cute little
stomach of yours.

No! Ok, fine I surrender. Fine
I'll go in.

â™ª Love is like a magnet â™ª

â™ª So this is it I've
accepted my fate â™ª

â™ª No more a victim
of petty charades â™ª

â™ª I'm on a new level
and calling the bluff â™ª

â™ª Between what I knew
and what should be love â™ª

I'll be right down the street
at the hotel if you need me.

In fact, sneak out and come stay
the night with me.

Honestly, Josh you're like an
exemplary Christian.

You leave certain body parts out
of your faith.

Marry me we won't have to have
this conversation.

I'll park the car down the
street.

Love you forever.

[soft pop music]

Good luck in there.

â™ª Magnetic magnetic â™ª

â™ª This is magnetic magnetic â™ª

â™ª Your love is like a magnet â™ª

Barry, I'm done.

Shelley, what are you?

Don't do this, not now.

I told you I was in editing all
night.

You know what just save your
breath.

I'm gonna go stay at the beach
house.

Could you take me bags to the
car? Thank you.

And I'm not coming back.

What are you talking about?

You handpicked each actors for
the shows.

Yea, and do you get how
ironically sick that is?

I handpick each one
of these actresses

and you turn them
into these desperate

sluts who will do
anything even sell

their souls to
be your next star.

Shelley, calm down, calm down.

We can work this out,
I can fix this.

No, it's done. I thought you
loved me.

Shelley, come on. We're a team.

There's no slut in team, Barry.

Oh nice.

You know everyone always blames
the producer.

What about all the
aggressive actresses who

see the title "producer"
as a target over

your head and throw
themselves at you and

try and use you to
further their career.

They go for it with
no conscience, they

don't care if you're
married gay or dead.

For the money, for the fame.

You know... it's not all my
fault.

I mean, really, really, who's
the victim here?

Yea, you're right Barry, you're
the victim.

No, you know what? You're the
ultimate cliche.

Shelley.

You know I've always
wanted to see China.

You know maybe we
could go get some sushi?

Sushi is Japanese, not Chinese.

I knew that.

â™ª I won't be defined
by a broken heart â™ª

So tonight I could show you
around.

His pants.

[sound guy]
You know if you'd let me

over that great wall of China

you're hiding behind,
we could have some fun tonight.

Did you get this shot?

Yea, I got the shot, watch your
fucking hand.

Hey, hey, I'm the producer
alright. I gotta make sure.

So are we back?

Yea, Brad we're back on.

Put them in the room next to
mine.

Action.

Well here we are at

our producers mansion where our

contestants are
gonna be staying for the

competition; And the
first of our multi-talented

female starlets
have just arrived.

Harley, are you in focus?
Yes.

Who do we have?

Isabella.

Can we take that back? Are we
still rolling?

Isabella, can you walk back into
frame please?

And action.

Alright and here we have one of
our next contestants, Isabella.

I would know that face anywhere.
How are you Isabella?

It's an honor to be here.

No, it's an honor to have ya.

[Spanish language]
Quiero saludar

a mi familia en casa.

Wow, it's gonna be a
hot competition isn't it?

Well thank you for joining us.
Come on through!

Alright guys, keep watching
lot's more coming up next.

Anything else? We missing
anything?

No, we're all good man,
we're all good. Don't

you worry, you just let
me do my thing alright?

It's my money.

I know it's your money.

Ms. excuse me, are you mocha?

Who are you?

I'm Matt, I'm a production
assistant.

What do you need?

They want you on camera right
now.

Fine!

Brad looks tired.

Yep, we're back on.

So who do we have here?

This is my little cutie Bella.

Bella's so cute, so do you have
a boyfriend?

Hi!

Wait for your turn! I don't
share my camera time, please.

Bitch.

Well keep watching, we'll be
right back.

Let's show you to your room.

Did you catch that?
Yes.

This is gonna be the best season
ever.

â™ª Onward and upward
and live be strong â™ª

Hey.

Hi, I thought I saw your name on

the call sheet.
Small world, yea?

How you been?

I'm good.

Really, really good.

Listen I just wanna apologize

for the way that I ended things
with you.

No, no, it's I...

Listen.

I know I went crazy
and if I were you

I would have broken
up with me too.

But I've changed.

Nice to see that you met orange
mocha frappuccino over there.

It's only gonna get worse trust
me.

Well it's not so bad right now.

Maybe we could hangout later?

I have some half moon we
could...

I gotta call my girlfriend,
we're living together now.

Look, good luck with all this.

It was really good seeing you.

I'll see you around ok?

[light pop music]

See you later.

[upbeat rhythmic music]

Alright guys quiet down, settle,
settle, settle.

We're gonna go for a take,
we are going

to go for a take.
Settle down please.

Quiet on set please, quiet on
set. Sam, you set?

Welcoming dinner, take one.

And... Action!

Ok, ladies.
Here's your vegan, vegetarian,

paleo, peanut free,
gluten free, welcome dinner.

A toast to my beautiful women

and the next
American Dream star.

To our producer, thank you for

making this
opportunity possible.

[Barry and ladies]
Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers.

Margaret.

Wow.

Alright, this tastes amazing.

My compliments to the chef.
You know nothing would ever beat

my grandmother's home cooking
but this... it's a close second.

Cut!

Crystal, honey.
You can't say that your

grandmother's cooking is
better than our master chef.

Let's do it again and this time
take a taste and say...

nothing ever beat
my grandmother's

cooking but yours just did.

But that's not true.

My grandma just
died and my family

will be watching this too,
I can't...

Crystal, listen honey...

no one gives a rat's ass about
your grandma. So just...

Quote the lines or you're off
the show.

Settle please.

Alright, rolling.

Alright guys let's go for

another one.

Welcome dinner, pickup on
Crystal.

Action.

Wow.

This tastes amazing.

My compliments to the chef.

Nothing ever beat my grandma's
home cooking.

But...

I'm sorry, I can't, I can't lie.

If I'm out then I'm out.

Cut!

What the bloody hell was that!

I can't lie.

You can't lie.

You can't lie.

This is a bloody reality show.

You have to lie.

It's called acting honey.

[ladies laugh]

Well I call being
disrespectful to my family

and my grandma's
memory something else.

So... if I'm out then I'm out.

So much the better,
she certainly wouldn't have

won the competition with
her lack of acting skills.

Survival of the fittest baby.

Crystal,
Sam didn't mean that, you're

not out just...
don't do it again. Ok?

Action.

You know this is really
delicious. If I win this

competition I'm gonna have
you be my personal chef.

Well that's already where you
lost.

"If I win" is a
statement submitting

yourself to a higher power.

I always say "when I win",
you know it opens the

universal energies and
manifests that vision of me.

Owning my power.

When I win instead of if I win?

Yea.

My life coach always taught me

it's always about
positive energy.

Please!
So you're saying that anyone

with absolutely
no talent could win

this competition
just from saying

"when I win"
instead of "if I win".

Yea but there's more to it than
just that.

Seriously, you guys are so

caught up in yourselves.

It's not about what
you think or what you

say. It's about what you
do and who you know.

You are very competitive women,
many

think a gain must
come at someone's loss.

If this is the prism which
through you see the world you

must be prepared to deal with
the stress of the competition.

Or you'll choke.

Fall victim of your own nerves.

I hope you choke.

[eery sounds]

[ethereal whispering]

Hey! What do you

think you're doing!

Give me that camera! You're not
supposed to take picture of us.

Why not?

Close in on Mocha and come in
here close on Amy, ok?

Because I'm a professional model

and my pictures are valuable.

You're taking something
personal without

our permission and
it's really rude of you.

You shouldn't be allowed to do
so.

Alright,
ladies you all signed releases

saying that we can
photograph and film you.

I will see to it
personally that all

those photos are on the show,
alright?

So we don't have any
right to say no?

Not after you sign the
contract girlfriend.

Cut, cut, Chloe that was great

but why'd you stop?

I want you to go over to Byron,
yell at him and then

throw water in his face and
then start in on Amy again. Ok?

You know this is not
a competition of skill

this is about exploiting.
There's no honor here.

This is bullshit. You know I'm
leaving.

Hey young lady I've
worked all day preparing

this meal for you and
now you've ruined it.

Just shut up.

You'll eat your words and don't
worry they're gluten free.

Hey calm down, you're gonna have
a heart attack.

Amy, may I please have the
camera?

Trust me.

Just for my vision board.
Cool.

Meditation.

Sam! This show's going to shit

let's go.

[ladies chattering]

[ominous music]

[disconcerting music]

Prism in what you view the
world.

Blah, blah, blah.

Better get ready for the
competition.

I'll show those girls who's in
control of the competition.

[dramatic, ominous music]

[unsettling sounds, ethereal
whispering]

Um hi.

Amy, hi, I...

I wanted to see if you're ok.

Everyone ganged up on you and...

Ok, look I'm in the middle of
something. Can this just wait?

Yea, sure I just wanted to say.

I'm here if you need a friend.
Something doesn't feel right.

Like I was even praying in my
room earlier and...

Oh ok, you're a...

you're one of those people, yea
that's right.

One of what?

Hashtag Jesus freak.

We have an early day tomorrow.

Amy, I'm just a normal person...

who happens to be a big fan of
Jesus too.

Yea, well I find religion too
confining. I need my freedom.

Your locket.

[ethereal whispering]

I've seen that crest somewhere
before.

Yea, it was a gift.

[disconcerting music]

Let's just quit,
I can call my boyfriend

and he can meet
us on the street.

Quit, really?
Yes.

Wow.

I've heard of people freaking
out before a competition

but you're taking this
to a whole other level.

Absolutely crazy to the second
power.

People don't achieve their
dreams because they simply quit.

I thought you Christians had
faith.

Go get some rest.

[Crystal Yea, but Amy your

locket is just...

Goodnight!

[disconcerting music]

Why does she have to put
everything in Latin?

[Sounding out Latin]

[ominous sounds]

[tense music]

Where's Chloe?

After the fight at dinner she
said she was leaving.

We're down to six.

Seriously?

Then where the bloody hell is
Mocha and Lucy?

Sir.
Yes.

Mocha said she wasn't coming to
the rehearsals.

What?

She said modeling with rank
amateurs is beneath her.

Excuse me?

And then she
offered to take Lucy

shopping and they're both out.

Could you sign this?

Yes, of course.

Right there.

Yea, right there. Copy.

There you go.

Wait till you see these outfits,
you're gonna die.

Bloody hell, four...

Four, we're down to four.

Yea.

They're dropping like flies.

And we only in rehearsals.

We haven't even started the
first emulation round yet.

Why are you smiling?

This is great man.
What!

We'll script it in.

This is the heart of
reality television.

Low class, rude behaviour,
everyone can relate to it.

Listen, we'll keep Mocha
and Lucy on we'll just

change the hook,
we'll make it "Difficult Divas".

And we'll play it up
every chance we get, lot's

of bitching.
I can't wait to see our ratings.

If the stress doesn't kill us
first.

Boss, the coffee you ordered.

Ah my morning drugs.

Barry, you're gonna give me a
aneurism.

You want something? Want a

Valium?
Can you get him a Valium?

How about a cup of tea,
perhaps with some cyanide in

it... and excuse me,
Almond milk, yes? Two sugars, no

almond milk, bring oat milk,
no oat milk, soy milk,

no soy milk just bring me
the cow I'll milk it myself.

You alright?
Shut up.

Are you sure you don't want
something a little stronger?

Just keep your hands
off me please.

Make sure it's in enter frame
safe.

What's this?

Why are you dressed like that?

I hate you so much.

Relax Sam, a couple of male
models called in sick. I needed

stand-in's for the catwalk

segment and the
guys volunteered.

What it's just rehearsals.

Just point the camera and shoot.

I'm outta here.

You bet, thank you very much.

Yea,
yea you're outta here alright.

[computer music]

What up, Snoop?

Yea, what's up. What's
happening?

You liked Taylor Young's
performance, yea?

Oh what a lady.

And that song she wrote.

Hey shit! Da da... That's an

amazing lyrications.
I like that.

Exactly.

Well Taylor wrote a song
just for you and she wants

to sing it with you when we
have her back on the show.

Give me a little bit of it,
how it

sound? Is it a slow
song or a fast song?

Ok, it's something like...

â™ª Eclipse she came together
when the lights when out â™ª

â™ª Eclipse â™ª

Shit I can't sing.

Well you go girl.

Oh check this out, Snoop.

Is that Snoop?
Yep.

Oooh weee.

Yes, sir best season ever baby.

Hey girl.

Hi, Snoop.

Hi, Snoop. I love your music.

I'm looking at you looking at me
I like what I see.

Attention minions it's show
time!

Oh gotta go Doggfather.

You better work.
Catch you later man.

Bye, Snoop.
Bye.

Ok, everybody keep it moving,
chins

down, eyes up,
booties out and we begin.

Fabiano is like the biggest
fashion designer.

Said no one ever.

â™ª Over the wings of a gull â™ª

â™ª To fly away and find rest â™ª

â™ª Tired of bondage that
you call love. â™ª

â™ª Tired of passing your test â™ª

â™ª Oh for the warmth of the sun â™ª

â™ª To melt your prison of ice â™ª

No, no, no, no, no.

Don't be such pussies.

We are strong independent women.

God dude,
what's up with these Fabiano

pants?
My balls are all tied in a knot.

Are you kidding me? I'm gonna
wear this to work tomorrow.

That's cause you got small
balls.

Yea.

Alright, let's do it again with

the special effects.
Keep it rolling.

And action.

â™ª You're too possessive
baby you're too obsessive â™ª

â™ª Too rough somehow
untie me now â™ª

â™ª Over the wings of a gull â™ª

â™ª Too fly away and find rest â™ª

â™ª Tied up bondage
that you call love â™ª

â™ª Tired of passing your test â™ª

â™ª Over the warmth of the sun â™ª

â™ª To melt your prison of ice â™ª

â™ª Your arms are so
cold release your hold â™ª

â™ª Nothing less that
fire can suffice â™ª

â™ª You have me down on my knees â™ª

â™ª I'm breaking â™ª
â™ª out of a squeeze â™ª

â™ª Cause I need
I need to be free â™ª

â™ª Break free â™ª

â™ª Rock it too possessive
baby too rough somehow â™ª

â™ª Possessive baby untie me now â™ª

â™ª Untie me now â™ª

â™ª I'm a free soul â™ª

â™ª I can do what I please â™ª


[eery sounds, ominous music]

Cut! Cut!

[screaming sounds]

What was that?

I think it was a glitch.

And a creepy one man.

[light disconcerting music]

What do you think they're gonna
do tomorrow?


Spider ew!

What?

Spiders freak me out.

Sorry I'm late.

Come sit here between me and the
spider queen.

Ha ha.

Hey Barry, you seen Brad?

Forget Brad, I'll do it.

Alright guys, settle,
settle, settle,

we're gonna go for a take,
let's do this.

Quiet on set please. Bonfire
scene.

And action.

Well girls now that
you've all told us what

you would do with a
million dollars if you're

the next winner of
American Dream I can

understand why you're
all competing so intensely.

Last night we started
talking about this but things

got a little out of control
so let's start again.

Why do you think you're gonna
win this competition?

Mocha, have a seat.

Well I am gonna
win because I have

been practicing for
years and I'm sorry

but if you don't
practice and hone

your skills,
you're never gonna win.

Either you're born with it or
you're not.

You can't practice.

Me here I don't need competition
I was born this way.

Too bad for you.

There's plastic surgery for
that.

[giggling, gasping]


[disconcerting sounds,
whispering voices]

That's strange, that's gas fire

there's no wood,
they don't spark.

You ok, Machiato?

No, I'm not ok.

And I'm so sick with all of you
bitches.

Chloe had the right idea
leaving. I don't need this.

Whoa, seems as if
one of our divas is really

steamed. Whoo. Amy,
last night at dinner you said

you believed it's all
about positive thinking,

about saying "when I
win" instead of "if I win".

Yea.

We need to get our power back.

We need to free of this dogma
and rules that mankind created.

Wait, so you're not saying that
you don't respect God's will?

That we shouldn't respect his
laws?

If you really believe
in that piece of

medal around your neck,
what is that?

The cross is just
a glorified piece of

jewelry.
What's that gonna do for you?

It's not the cross, it's what it
stands for.

For the message of the cross is

foolishness to those
who are perishing.

But to those who are being saved

it's message is
the power of God.

I was raised Jewish and
I believe. I don't always go

to temple on Saturdays
but I believe there is a God.

How on earth can you live
without bacon?

Jewish people can't have bacon,
right?

That's orthodox Jews.

When I was a baby...

my mom was taking me to church
to get baptized.

She was a devout Christian.

[very light tender music]

We never made it to church that
day

because a truck ran a red light.

So if God...

if God was in control, then why
would he let an innocent woman

taking her baby to church to
get baptized die in a car crash?

I'm so sorry.

You weren't baptized?

I just told you my
mom died and all

you can ask me
is if I was baptized?

No, I wasn't ok?

See this, this is what I'm
talking about.

Hashtag religious freak.

Amy, I'm sorry that's not what I
meant.

Amy.

Couldn't see that one coming.

Hey, this is good this is really
good.

Let's...

Let's have a seance
and see if we can bring

back Amy's dead mother
and see who's gonna win.

We can invoke the powers
from beyond and see if they

tell us who's right and who's
gonna win the competition.

Ok, cut!

Alright!

Thank you ladies, that was
great. I'll see you tomorrow.

I'm outta here.

The night's still young... let's

just sit back and
enjoy the bonfire.

Barry, you look great on camera.
You're a natural.

Yea, you don't even need a host.
You got this.

Yea... you two.

[Barry chuckling]

Gotta love Hollywood.

[ominous music]

Amy, you ok? What's going on?

[tender music]

Don't go please.

I need you.

I can't. I'm sorry.

[sad music]

You think you're gonna win? You
don't have a leg to stand on.

[tense dramatic music]

[Amy speaking Latin]


Don't worry Bella, that guy's
coming for us soon. Ok?

[Speaking Latin]

Bella.

What's the matter baby? Aww
Bella.


It's just a suit of armor Bella.

Oh poor Bella, it's ok.

[Amy speaking Latin]

[extremely tense music]

Everything's ok, Bella.

[squishing sound]

[dog whimpering]

[phone ringing]

Hey babe, sorry I forgot to call
you back.

[ominous tones]

I came first.

He'll always be mine.

Yea, I would love to
come home sweetie

but I have another
scene to shoot.

[eery ethereal sounds]

[dark piano chord music]

You're checking on my call
sheets now?

I don't care what time it is.

No, I don't know when I'm gonna
be home either!

Well I'm sorry you feel that
way. I'm sorry!

You know what, no.
I'm just gonna

stay here tonight. Forget it.

Look, I gotta go. Ok?

Bye.

â™ª Evil thoughts
is taking over me â™ª

â™ª Oh God I'm tired... â™ª

[Amy speaking Latin]


Who is it?

Byron.

Well that's the power of
positive thinking.

I'll be right there.

I can't stay away.

â™ª Today I'm free â™ª

â™ª Back that no-step I am free â™ª

â™ª One of them counts as me â™ª

â™ª Cause I'm on my
way to my own town â™ª

â™ª I am free â™ª

â™ª Back that no step I am free â™ª

[upbeat Caribbean music]

â™ª Say I say I â™ª

â™ª Want you to take me there â™ª

â™ª Do what bliss where I can be â™ª

â™ª Living in the harmony â™ª

Hey, Kirk. Can I trust you to be
a gentleman?

Course, Crystal.

Ok, you lovely ladies I need you
over there please.

Amy and Crystal
please go sit by the

pool looking great.
Thank you so much.

And Lucy go join Peyton in one
of the loungers. Thanks so much.

Isabella, Isabella, where's
Isabella?

Isabella is inside shaving her
legs. She really needed it.

Do you have a
stopwatch on your phone?

You have an alarm on your phone?

Yea.

Good, tell her if she's not
out here in five minutes then

she's off the show
and we'll replace her

with someone else.
Mocha, I need Mocha!

Where's Mocha? Where is
everybody?

Apparently after her
little temper tantrum last

night she made good
on her threat. She left.

She, she, she?

Oh this is just freaking ass
craptacular!

What!

Sir, would you like me to move

that one lounge
chair off the set?

No!

[upbeat piano music]

Excuse me Isabella?

Hi.

Director wants you on set like
now.

Thanks, Tony, tell him I'll be
there in just a few minutes.

Sure, Isabella.

But the director said that
if you weren't on set in like

4 minutes 10 seconds he would
kick you off the show so...

Yea.

Tony, could you please bring me
that towel over there?

Sure Isabella.

Thanks Tony.

So...

You wanna be a producer someday?

Yea, that's the dream.

Would you like to dry my back
for me?

Tony?

I don't wanna be that kind of
producer.

[melancholy music]

[ominous sounds]

[eery voices]

Who's there?

Tony?

[horrible screeching]

â™ª Days go by from society â™ª

â™ª I want you to take me there â™ª

I have died and gone to heaven

Crystal, a little more puckering
of the lips.

Crystal, more, more!
There we go. Love that

camera. Amy,
love that camera there we go.

Lovely, good. Amy...

Tony says Isabella is still in

the bathroom.

Great.

Alright girls it's just you
three. Action.

Beautiful, beautiful,
pay turns.

Sexier! There we go!
Nice!

Yes, God is good.
Move your bodies a little more

girls. Sexier, there we go.
Kisses. Beautiful.

This looks terrific. You are
like three beautiful roses.

Where the hell have you been?

How's you find me?

Did you think
that you could just

get away from me?
I got the camera,

I got the crew
but I got no star.

You cost me a
lot of money today.

Let's go.

The hell she will. Who are you?

Producer.

I have a real shot here.

The only shot you're
good for is a money

shot, and besides
this isn't a discussion.

Get your shit and let's go.

Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you

to leave.

What?

Listen asshole there's
two ways you can leave

here, in handcuffs or
on your own accord.

That is after you
sign a release.

Please tell me you got that.

Yes!

So that's how it's gonna be
right?

Let's go.

Ok, I'll see you later.

Have a goodnight everyone.

Night, guys.

Later guys.
Night Kirk.

Night.

Where'd you stash it?

Shrooms are in right end stand,
top

drawer.
You're gonna be tripping balls.

Thanks brother, they'll be

something extra
in your paycheck.

Oh boss, only you can find a way
to make it tax deductible.

Alright Sam, the cast tonight

will be three girls and Brad.

What? No. Two quit and one was
fired, we got four.

Apparently Crystal's a devout
Christian and she flat out

refuses to attend the seance.

She's going to church tonight,

something about
praying for my soul.

This is a good thing. We can use
it Sam. Alright?

We play up the
difficult divas angle

before the seance starts,
Madam Destiny

will be here any minute.
You won't

have to worry about her,
she's a pro.

Ok? She's like one
of the best Hollywood

psychics around but we
need to play this up ok?

You know like a horror movie?

A lot of close ups,
not too much

lighting, and have someone
do some effects. Got it?

Got it.

Byron, Kirk. If the seance
scene gets too boring

just creep it up a bit just
do something spooky.

Do we get paid extra for the
effects?

No, but you get to keep your
job.

Copy that boss.

Well ain't he a barrel of
sunshine.

[light tense music]

Bella, where's Mocha, baby?

Hey...

You lost?

What happened?

Come here.

[eery sounds]

Is that blood on you?

Did you get in a fight?

Baby it's ok baby.

Hey.

[demonic sounds]

[tense music]

[ethereal voice]
I am coming for you.

[whispering voices]

[car sputtering]

Damn.

[ethereal voice]
You are mine.

Please God, please make this
car start.

Please father God.

[engine turns over]

[tires screeching]

[dog barking]

[demonic chuckling, screeching
roaring]

[Crystal screams]

Oh my God!

Oh father thou art
in heaven hallowed

be thy name thy will be done.

Honor thy name.

Oh my God what do I do!

God, what do I do?

I command all demons out of this

car by the power
of Jesus oh God.

I command all demons
out of this car by

the power of holy
name of Jesus Christ.

Get the hell outta my car!

â™ª Clouds of dust â™ª

â™ª Empty rooms â™ª

â™ª Every breath â™ª

â™ª I feel consumed â™ª

â™ª And every time I try â™ª

â™ª To break out of this cage â™ª

â™ª Another piece of night â™ª

â™ª Falls away â™ª

â™ª Night is only to way â™ª

â™ª Winter is warming â™ª

â™ª Darkness will rise â™ª

No matches.

â™ª Don't you dare
give up on hope â™ª

â™ª Cause then the sun will roam â™ª

â™ª It's always darkest
right before the dawn â™ª

â™ª Hold on till morning â™ª

Something's troubling

you then lady?

Father.

I think I just exorcised a
demon out of my car.

Sounds like you're involved in
some spiritual warfare.

I don't know what to do.
There was like

this weird goth
looking woman thing.

It took over my car, it almost
killed me.

I can't go to the police they're

going to think I'm crazy.
Am I crazy?

No...

but what are we talking about,
right?

Light and dark? Angels and
demons?

Good versus evil.

[tender music]

I knew I shouldn't have
come to L.A. I just had

this bad intuition that
something was gonna happen.

I think God was
trying to tell me

not to come,
that it wasn't safe.

Intuitions sometimes can be a
good thing.

Right? They can warn us.

Or it can prepare us for certain
challenges.

Like the one you're facing now.

There's a girl I met...

I think she's in
danger too but she

doesn't believe me, she's not
a Christian. She has this locket

around her neck and it has
the symbol of witchcraft on it.

She's lost but she's innocent.

I'm not surprised.

If you're a true follower of
Jesus well...

then you're protected. If you
stay in the light.

If you don't...

you leave yourself open to evil.

[tense music]

I can't go back there.

I'm going straight to Josh and
we're going home.

By the way Josh is my boyfriend.

Well fiance. No boyfriend, no

maybe,
well maybe fiance I'm hoping.

I understand.

You know...

sometimes committing to marriage
forever...

takes more courage than...

exorcising demons.

Yea.

Tell me more about your friend.

I can't help her.

I can't even go back to that
house and...

she's all alone.

[ominous music]

I have something for you.

This is for you...

[dramatic music]

and this holy water.

You're going to need it.

Oh I can't accept this this must

be very valuable
the date is 1692.

Throughout history God has
chosen certain people

to help him in the fight.

Like David and Goliath.

You know that story?

See David knew that if God was
with him well then...

nothing was impossible.

What am I a superhero now?

I'm just a school teacher who
likes playing the violin.

And David was just a sheep
herder until God called him.

It's a choice you're
going to have

to make of your own free will.

You have a good heart.

God is with you.

He's going to protect you.

[magical music]

Father, I can't.

[intriguing music]

Hey guys you seen Brad? Hey?

Why is Barry in this shot?

He's an attention whore.

Alright everybody let's get this
going, here we go.

Rolling.

Seance, take one.

Sweet spirits...

We the living are about to
seek...

We are going to get
in touch with those

who have passed
on to the other side.

We must create a welcoming
atmosphere.

To invite the spirits to answer
questions...

and to deliver messages from the
great beyond.

So.

Does everyone here believe

that it is possible to
communicate with the dead?

I do believe.

Yes.

Yes... I do.

I believe.

Good, then we are in agreement.

[phone music starts playing]

Ooh sorry.

Oh, I'm sorry it's my agent.

Cut!

I'm in the middle of a seance
t.t.y.l.

I'm really sorry, I promise it
won't happen again.

Alright guys let's

settle, settle, settle.

Pickup on the psychic.

Action.

Let us all join hands.

[intriguing music]

[Madame Destiny humming]

We welcome the spirits into this
house

to speak with us and to speak
through us.

Ohhh spirits...

from the great beyond

you are welcome here.

We ask... that you would... make
yourself known to us...

if you are in this room.

[ominous music]

[demonic sounds]

Good job.

Welcome, spirits.

Who are we speaking to?

Can you tell us who will be the
next American Dream winner?

[pageant music]

[demonic sounds]

[high pitched demonic voice]
It is coming for you Amy.

Who are you?

It wants you... to...

[candles sparking]

[deeper demonic voice]

[Madame's voice]
I command you out!

[demon groaning]

[Madame's voice]
There is no power

on heaven or on

earth greater than
the almighty God!

[demonic voice]
She will be mine!

[Madame's voice]
You are no longer welcome

in my body. I am not open to
you!

I command you in the name of
Jesus who is the Christ.

[demon groaning]

In the power and authority of
that name, I command you out!

I command you out!

[demonic noise, crystal cracks]

[Madame gasping]

Oh I am out of here.

What about your check?
Mail it to my agent.

Barry, there is something
evil in this house. I mean

what we just did gave it
permission, more power here.

Wow, what a performance.

You need to listen to me,
you need to cleanse this house

with some white sage, some
holy oil and some holy water!

Immediately.

You never know
when to turn it off, will

do Destiny.
Thank you and great job.

Peace out my brother.

Wow, she was amazing.

That was some great F and X.

I didn't do that.

It wasn't us man.

Yea, right.

Well great job ladies,
we gotta turn in early.

We gotta big day
tomorrow at the sound stage.

Put the time... c'mon.

[soft rock playing lightly]

â™ª When it rains I've got Jack â™ª

â™ª Got all the drugs
for feeling fine â™ª

â™ª Every day is good to be me â™ª

â™ª Alright â™ª

[phone ringing]

What up, Snoop?

Hey, what's up what's happening?

had a seance with

Destiny,
we got a lot of great footage.

Oh for real?

Oh yea and then...

Destiny lost it and she thinks

there's evil spirits
in the house.

She told me check this out, she
told me to cleanse the house.

Please believe it.

[ominous sounds]

Snoop?


Snoop?

â™ª Showtime I've done and I
could rip never forgive me â™ª

â™ª My ego in love cause rhythms
love but I have to split â™ª

â™ª Just kidding I ain't telling â™ª

â™ª I am made â™ª

â™ª Well honey I really have to... â™ª

[Speaking Latin]


Is your BFF in

shining armor milady.

[eery sounds]

[pop music continues]

I come bearing gifts, wine,
edible for my lady.

The gift I want to do is...

â™ª I'm the best that
you'll never have â™ª

They're already kicking in.

Drink up handsome.

[easy listening music]

Yea, that's what I'm talking
about.

Oh that's the first award I ever
won.

Play your cards right and you'll
get one of those.

Oh really?

Yea.

I never tried mushrooms before.

Oh baby, I can tell.

You know, Barry.

Yes?

This is going to be a night that

you will never forget.

Never.


[easy rock music]

So Barry.

Which one of us is going to be
your next American Dream girl?

How about both of you?

[all laughing]

Good answer.

You two should have your own TV
series.

Ooh that's a good idea.

â™ª You take me â™ª

[eery sounds]

â™ª Dreaming inside you â™ª


These are strong.

[disconcerting sounds]


Get off me!

Get off me! Help!

Murray?

[demonic chuckling]

What the hell?

Spiders, there's spiders!
They're coming out of your eyes.

[ladies yelling]

Murray, what are you doing here?
I'm gonna kill you!

Get away from me.

[tense music]

[brunette screaming, bludgeoning
sound]

Barry, are you in there?

Such a wonderful morning and...


[dramatic music]

No... no... no, it can't be.

No.

â™ª Time is not my
friend it's an enemy â™ª

â™ª Losing air like
losing gravity â™ª

Have you seen Byron?

I haven't seen him.

Has anyone seen Byron!

Miss are you staying here?

We need you to go an get some

clothes and and
come on down to the

living room for questioning.

Sir will you please come with me

So... Crystal.

Sweet roll?

My name's Chief Detective
Ressler, you were one of

the remaining contestants
on the American Dream show?

I wasn't gonna continue.

Why not? Isn't there like a

million dollar prize
or something?

A lot of people would kill for
that.

They were going way beyond just
being a talent contest.

Like last night
they were holding a

seance to see who
was gonna win the show.

I'm a Christian and that's
against my religious beliefs.

Where were you
last night between the

hours or 10pm and
5am this morning?

I was at the hotel with my...

with Josh... my boyfriend.

I wasn't even gonna
come back and

we even talked about it, but...

This morning I realized that the
priest I spoke with was right.

I should return and
follow through with my

commitment.
So I drove back this morning.

Let's have you wait in the
living room.

â™ª Tick and tock
and tick and tock â™ª

â™ª and can't outrun
whatever's coming â™ª

â™ª Feels like I can't breath â™ª

â™ª I'm upside down â™ª

Alright everybody listen up.

For those of you who are

the living room till we release
you to go to your rooms.

Please do not, I repeat

yellow tape in front of them.

They are now crime scenes.

Thank you.

[somber music]

Chief. We can rule out...

anybody here or anywhere
else for that matter,

suspects. The two dead
girls killed each other.

The things people will do to win
a reality show contest, right?


detectives on your iPad?

Yea.

So did you like put hidden
cameras in the bathrooms too?

Maybe.

That's creepy.

Hey, I wonder if this is
gonna be on the news? Hey

do you think we should
do my makeup just right?

Really, Brad? You're serious?

Yea.

Well he's gonna need
makeup if he doesn't

shut up cause I'm gonna
punch him in the face.

[tender dramatic music]

Lab results are in, psilocybin
in the tea cups.

Poor bastard.

Yea, he is in no

condition to talk.

His vitals are stable but no
neuro response.

Tied up with two dead

girls on top of you... only in
Hollywood.

Has anybody seen this guys wife?

The housekeeper said she's
at the beach house, I've got

somebody going down there
to bring her in for questioning.

What about the contestants who
quit and the missing crew guy?

I can't get anybody by phone but

we're still searching
the premises.

Hey, excuse me?
Could I get some coffee

to go with this?
Black. Thank you.

Have the guys search for a
hidden wine cellar or a...

safe room.
Keep in mine we're still

looking for this
guys dealer too.

What's with the hair guys?

Yea, we were working under
cover.

Anyway, we found the guy in the

storage room he
was with his friends.

You better take a look at this.

Jesus!

[detective pony tail]
We have a serial killer.

Some sort of satanic
symbol with six

points.
What is that a pentagram?

No, no, a pentagram is 5 points,
6 points is heptagram?

I think a heptagram is 7 points,
6 points is a hexagram.

Well whatever you wanna call it
there are dead bodies on three

of the points and there's a
guys heart in the center. I'm

thinking something must have
scared the murderer off last

night before they time to bring
the other victims in there.

The murderer probably laced the
tea cups with the hallucinogen

and let the last two victims
do the dirty work for him.

So that would cover 5 points out
of the 6.

Meaning... missing point, that's
our missing victim.

Last two contestants need to be
guarded.

After we interview the
crew send them home and

keep them all under
surveillance. Alright, lock

down the house.
The two girls are staying here

so let's post a 24 hour
guard at the back door and

we'll put Max the big security
guard at the front door.

Just to be safe
let's post a guard

at the hospital for
our listed Romeo.

Oh yea... keep the chef here on
lock down too.

Why?

Just do what I say.

Hey Matt, are you ok?

No, no, I'm not ok.
I signed up to be a part of the

entertainment industry not some

drug-denner,
this murder mystery.

[phone rings with hip-hop]

Hang on a second.
Sam had Barry's

calls forwarded to my phone.

Really?

American Dream.

What's happening?

Mr. Dogg.

Hi, Snoop Dogg it's Matt here
too.

Barry's not answering your calls
because he was carried away.

Is she cute?

No, no, like physically carried
away by the paramedics.

The whole show was
shut down too and now

everybody is talking about
these witchcraft murders.

Ok, ok, ok, seriously.

Seriously Mr. Dogg there are

detectives all
around the house and

every bodies
either dead or being

investigated except for Barry.

Oh wow.

He's in some kind of coma.

You know like Han Solo in
carbonite.

They say it was anaphylactic
something cause by psi...

Psilocybin.

Look it up.

We're supposed to go to the
hospital.

I still think we should go home
instead.

You got to walk back again man.

See you at the hospital?

You're doing an amazing job.

Oh man my mom wants me to quit.

You can't quit.

You gotta hang in there,
Hollywood needs sane people.

Wanna see Barry?

Yea, whatever's left of him.

[ominous sounds]

Come in I have

something to tell you.

I have

something to tell you too.
Listen I almost left.

Crystal, please just shut up ok?
I have to show you something.

I think I'm the murderer.

The reason that Byron
wasn't here today is because

he was with me last night
and when we woke up...

his heart was on this
pillow but he was gone but

his heart was there
and it was still beating.

Amy, Amy, there's nothing there.

You're not a the murderer,
I know you're not.

Really, really? Then how do you
explain this?

How do you explain this!

No, you just can't be the
murderer. You just can't!

But the murders have something
to do with this board.

This parts in Latin. I teach
Latin in my class.

[ominous music]

Amy, do you know what this
mantra says?

It says I offer
myself and these six

sacrifices to you.
Have you been saying this?

I thought it was a
positive statement

just to put out
into the universe.

Oh yea well they're out there

alright,
you do realize that this is

witchcraft?
And offering sacrifices,

where did you get all this?

From my life coach Liz but she
just puts harmless forces out of

nature and just
positive energies

and that's it,
it's all harmless.

Yea well a lot of dead people.
Ok...

Liz what? What's her name? Does
she have like a website?

It's: I see for you
life coaching dot-com

Alright, let's look this up.

You have the same
locket and I looked up what

that symbol means,
did she give it to you?

Yea, it was a gift.

It's a family crest

mixed with a satanic symbol.
It actually belonged to the

Williams family back in the
1600's. Here I'll show you.

[intrigue music]

In 1692 in Salem,
Abigail Williams

was the first
accused witch to be

burned at the stake for having

sacrificed 6 young
women to the devil so

that she could possess
his demonic powers.

Her niece Bridget turned her in
to stop the murders.

[people yelling]

Burn her!

You're gonna burn in hell!

You're no family to me.

How could you be my accuser? How
could you betray me?

I had to stop the killings. I
curse you and your descendents.

You were killing innocent
people.

I could have given
you everything,

we could have had everything.

Her niece Bridget

turned her in to stop the
murders. It is said that as she

was burning at the stake,
before she died... Abigail tried

to cast a spell on her niece
and her sister's descendents

to carry her spirit and the
demon she had inside of her.

Burn her! Burn her! Burn that
witch! Burn her!

[people yelling]

Joseph, it's time.

No.

Curse you and your bloodline.

I send my demon upon you.

He will live in you and your
children's children.

[Speaking Latin]

[Abigail screaming]

You and your family
keep your eyes on Jesus,

you will be safe.
And, your children's

children must to all
they can to resist the

temptations of the
demonic forces of witchcraft.


Burn in Hell you evil witch.

There was a priest there who
intervened, defended Bridget

and prayed for God to
protect her and her descendents.

[dramatic music]

That's the same priest I spoke
with last night.

What priest? When did you talk
to a priest?

All descendents in the
Williams family line are

said to still carry the
birthmark from the curse.

Amy, you're a descendent. You
have the birth mark.

After Abigail died her ashes
were kept in a sacred vault

by a coven of witches who became
Abigail's followers determined

to bring the demon back through
the William's family line.

It's said that they wore
Abigail's ashes inside

lockets.
The lockets have small shards of

mirror on them indicating
that Abigail's spirit

could be scried through
reflective surfaces.

[eery whispering]

Amy,
your life coach Liz is a part of

that coven.

She's a follower of that
cult and she is the murderer

and has been using
witchcraft and demonic forces.

[eery tense music]

Those are not Crystal's in your

necklace,
those are ashes from the witch.

Amy, this isn't you. You have to
put that down.

Amy!

Amy, take of the necklace. That
thing is controlling you.

You're gonna have to wake up.
Put that down. Put it down!

[unsettling music]

Amy, are you ok?

Amy!

God, help.

You.

You.

Take off the damn necklace!

[demonic whispering voices]

Amy?

Amy?

C'mon, you have to destroy the
vision board. C'mon.

[eery music and voices]

This wasn't on here before.

Just destroy it!

Fuck positive thinking!

When you call on forces in
the universe and you leave God

out of that equation, who
do you think is gonna answer?

Spirits that are not from him!

And now Liz has been
using innocent people as

sacrifices and been
using you to let in a demon.

I didn't know!
We have one more blood sacrifice

and now Liz is
gonna be out to get us.

We have to call
the cops or she's

gonna come back into our house.

Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, my
purse.

Hold up, Max.

[tense music]

[low tense music]

She's in here.

C'mon, let's go.

Oh my God, Chef Dominic!
Oh my God.

Ok, ok.
Ok, just call for help.

God I can't call for help!
Go get help please, Crystal.

Just go get help, go get help.
I'm fine.

[glass breaking, Crystal
exclaiming in pain]

What's wrong?

I just cut my arm it's fine.

I'll be back with help.

[dramatic music]

Amy, Crystal...

[tense music]

Amy...

Crystal...

[intrigue music]

Nobody can stop

your destiny now.

You both can't run from me
forever.

Amy, I just wanna talk with you.

[door shutting]

You wanted freedom.

You wanted powers in the
universe to flow through you.

You didn't want to have to
follow religious dogma.

Or rules of God.

Grow up!

Nothing comes without a price.

[tense music]

[dramatic music]

That is why we
had to get rid of your

mother,
she was gonna ruin everything.

We had to save
you from the baptism

and leave you
open to be a vessel.

Shelley helped me with that, she
gave me a key to get in here.

See, I was always with you.

You let Crystal is escape.

That was a big mistake.

We have to pay for it now.

Remember...

there has to be
a sixth sacrifice

and it has to be a woman.

[tense music]

[Liz speaking Latin]

[knife slicing, Liz yelling]

[ominous music]

[whispering sounds]

Hey, Crystal it's me... my
phone's back on.

Liz is dead.

[light tense music]

People see the world and say
that God created it.

It's not that I never
believed in God but I can't

conceive that a God or
a demon or anybody...

beyond our...

physical reality could have
control or power over us.

I always believed in
positive thinking, we

were our own God and
goddesses and that...

that we master our future and
visualize our destinies and...

I believe that if you put
something out there...

the universe answers back.

But you were right.

[demonic grunting]

I put something out...

[demon exclaiming]

[tense music]

something answered back.

Please just don't come back, ok
please.


[Amy screaming]

[banging on the door, demonic
yelling]

I got your call.

Liz is dead...

but that thing is out
to get me and it's not

out to get you.
Ok, so please just go, ok?

Nobody is going to die.

I know how to beat this thing.
We have to

make it back to the
room of sacrifice.

I know how to beat this.

Hey, I got your message!

[Amy screaming]

Came as fast as I could.

Oh this is...

this is Josh.

Hi.

[demon screaming]

Ok, we just have to move, she's
coming.

[dramatic music]

Wait, the holy water!


Come, come, come.



[grunting screeching]

I think it wants best, Amy.

What do we do?

I don't know, just we just gotta

keep that evil from possessing.
Ok.

When I was in trouble
I was talking to a priest

and he said he could
help and he gave me these.

[screeching, banging]

We gotta close the door to
Satan and that's where we're

gonna open the door to Christ.
Ok? You need to be baptized.

What? What!

It's the one thing your mother
never got to do for you.

Guys I don't hear it anymore.

[demon grunting, Josh yelling,
ladies screaming]

Whatever you're gonna do do it
fast!

Ok, alright, fine. That's
the same symbol as on your

pendant. That's gotta be
where the power's coming from.

That's where you need to be
baptized. Hurry, come on.

Ok.

Repeat after me, Lord Jesus I
repent of my sins.

Lord Jesus I repent of my sins.

God, help us!

[things falling]

Josh, help us.

What do I do?

I don't know just do something!

Do something crazy.

In the name of Jesus Christ,
I rebuke you!

In the name of Jesus Christ,
I rebuke you!


It's the name of all names.
Right?

And I saw it in the exorcist.

[mellow music]

Amy, you need to fill your being
with the holy spirit.

Do you renounce
Satan and all the empty

promises and all the
false glamors of sin?

I do.

[eery sounds, building
crumbling]

Powers of Hell can't her back
up!

Don't go, Josh!

[dramatic rock music]

I got it, I got it, I got it.

I know you...

You and Amy finish the baptism!

Do you believe in God and in
Jesus Christ his son?

Yes, yes.

Blood of Christ!
No!


No, Jesus come into my heart. I
make you my lord and savior.

[Amy screaming, heavenly music,
sizzling sound]

[soft music]

What was I thinking?

Not seeing right through Liz.

And that vision board?

Amy, just stop.

Don't beat yourself up, ok?

There's really nothing
wrong with vision

boards... and we are
supposed to think positively.

It's called faith.

Just don't ever forget where
that power really comes from.

You just need to love God.

Yea.

But that demon...

That thing almost
killed us because

you didn't follow the rules.

People always complain about
God's rules, that they're so

restricting but
they've been around

a really long time for a reason.

Do you think it'll come back?

No.

Josh?

Yes.

Yes, you think it's gonna come
back?

No.

Yes, what?

Yes...

I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

And yes...

if we can survive through a
demonic attack...

we can survive through marriage.

I've...

had this thing the whole time.

Put this on you.

Yes.

Yea.

Oh my God.

Come here.

Oh my God.

We've been through Hell and
back.
