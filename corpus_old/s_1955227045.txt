[Elevator music]


[Music playing]

How'd that feel?



Mm.

What time is it?

It's a little after 4:00.

That late?

Wow.

Then again, we did kind
of have a busy night.

Uh, look.

I don't mean to be rude, but uh,
I've got to get to work soon.

So you know, if you could...

No problem.

Um, when you get back
later, we'll... we'll go out.

Yeah.

You know, actually,
I think... you know,

I'm positive I have
something going on tonight.

OK maybe some other time.

All right. Let me just
lay here a couple hours.

Um, actually, I was
kind of thinking maybe

You could leave right now.

Right now?

Yeah.

So let me say this out loud,
just to get it straight.

You have no reservations
about [scoffs] taking me here

And having sex with you, but you
develop a Texas-sized complex

Because you don't trust me to
stay here when you're not here?

What do you think, Ryan?

The minute that you leave,
a van's gonna pull up

And I'm going to load it with
your 200-year-old black and

White television, your
garage sale couch,

And your got it from someone's
curb, doesn't look great lamp?

Sorry.

I've just never
done this before.


God forbid it should
be something personal.

We only fucked each other.

I'm willing to
bet you never pull

Any sensitivity muscles, huh?


Jeez, man.

What's your number?

Maybe I'll call you sometime.

Can you tell me my name?


If you can tell me my name,
then I'll give you my number.

All right.

Just... just give me a minute.

Minute's up.

You're going on two.

Listen, I think writing down
my phone number... I don't know.

Would be a waste of your ink.

Well, look.

Can't I have a hint?

Can we play charades?

[Pills rattling]

[Water running]

[Phone ringing]

ANSWERING MACHINE: This is Ryan.

Leave a message at the beep.


TRISH (ON PHONE): Hi Ryan.

This is Trish.

Thought we had plans,
but you didn't show.

What's up?

Call me, bye.

[Phone ringing]

This is Ryan.

Leave a message at the beep.


CAROLINE (ON PHONE):
Hi, it's Caroline.

You've been quite a tough
person to get a hold of lately.

You must be working
a lot or something.

Please call me when
you get this, OK?


[Phone ringing]


Hey, don't look at me like that.

I... look.

I'm not the Antichrist, here.

I didn't promise her a thing.

Stuck my dick in her.

Last time I checked,
that wasn't proposing.

All sex is is an enjoyable
aerobic exercise.

Unless both have formally
agreed beforehand that the act

Is equal to something more.

Sex just happens to require
two people, like in gym class,

When one kid would
hold your feet

Down so you could do sit ups.

I mean, who decreed
that by having sex,

You're suddenly attached at
the hip with that person?

The church?

Yeah.

I'm going to take
advice on my sex life

From a group who thinks copping
a feel is grounds for being

Sent to the 10th level of hell?

It's easy for a priest to decree
that when their entire sex life

Is a series of one man shows.

you can respect, let alone

Commit, to a woman
who will sleep

With you on the first date.

Am I wrong or what?


Now... now I'm not happy.

But... but... but who's happy?

What the hell is happy, anyways?

Happy is a delusion.

A safety net concept invented
by the government in order

To make us believe we're going
to be rewarded for the shitty

Lives we lead instead of simply
facing the fact that if we

Threw ourselves out the window,
the only thing that would

Change is our relatives
would save money

On buying Christmas gifts.

But... but I can definitely,
without a doubt,

Say that I'm content.

I'm content as a
breast fed baby.

Do you have any movies
where people get tied up?

Pornos are in the back.

No, not pornos.

I want movies where people
get like, tortured, you know?

Tied up and just like beaten.

Do you have anything like that?

You know, actually we do.

We have a whole section of
movies dedicated to torture.

It's right between
the section of movies

Dedicated to puppy
fucking and the movies

Dedicated the fecal eating.

But if you get to the
section on kitten burning,

Then you've gone too far.

Are you mocking me?

Yep.

I'd like to see the manager.

OK.

How can I help you?

You're the manager?

And you're the sharpest
knife in the drawer.

Look, bud.

I'm going to take a
Vegas size gamble here

And say that you're literate.

OK?

The sign outside
says Video Zone.

It doesn't say deviants,
freaks, and assholes, OK?

So why don't you take your
goofy, I'm dating my sister ass

And get out of my store.

Where do you get...

Have a nice day.


What was that all about?

I swear to Christ, I think
mental institutions plan

Their field trips to our store.

Bad day?

You know, I did
an informal poll.

Half our customers slash
inmates are on some type

Of antipsychotic medication.

Every fucking customer
that has come in here today

Look like they belong at the
open casting call for the kid

On the porch in "Deliverance."

I don't even think we're
managing a video store anymore.

I think we've crossed over
into some unknown circle

Of Dante's "Inferno."

This is a rest stop
on the way to hell.

Who's that?

This new guy who
works here nights.

He's a temp.

His name's Alex
something or other.

Hm.

Is he cool?

He's OK.

I mean, I don't want
to drive cross country

With him or anything, if
that's what you're saying.

Just, he doesn't talk.

What?

I tried striking up a
coworker rapport of sorts.

Employee banter?
Exactly.

Got nothing.

As a conversationalist,
the guy ranks

Right there at the bottom.

Right between Benedictine
monks and street mimes.

You're a snob, man.

What?

You are.

You're an intellectual snob.

Get the hell out of here.

It's the truth, man.

You've got a problem
with everybody.

Uh, he doesn't talk enough.

He babbles too much.

He said irony instead
of coincidence.

Yeah, I've got a low
stupidity tolerance.

What's wrong with that?

You tell me.

When was your last girlfriend?

Hey man, that was my
mom's fault, all right?

I brought her home and
my mom started drilling

Her about her sexual history.

Crabs?

What about crabs?

Do you have crabs?

Have you been checked for crabs?


I'm not talking about that one.

I'm talking about
the one before that.

Jennifer?

Well, Jennifer failed the test.

No.

You didn't give her the
"Raising Arizona" test.

Fuckin' A I did.

And there's no way the
relationship could continue,

Because she failed that test.

What the hell does that prove?

It proves
everything, all right?

If you cannot enjoy a brilliant
cinematic comedic masterpiece

Like Joel and Ethan's "Raising
Arizona," then you are bound...

I mean, like,
genetically bound...

To show up with deep
or numerous human

Flaws somewhere along the line.

And Wilt Chamberlain,
you are the last one

Who should be lecturing
me about my love life.

You realize we got a
pool going in the back?

All the customers are placing
bets to see what happens

First, AIDS or Ryan Junior.

The amount of women
you slept with

Looks like the sign at
McDonald's that are how

Many millions they've served.

Look, why don't you
just shut the fuck up

About that, all right?

All right, look. "Raising
Arizona" wasn't the only reason

I broke up with Jennifer.

What was the other reason?

She said she wouldn't
read Shakespeare's "Richard"

"III" because she hates sequels.


Oh.

Fuck!

So are you coming tonight?

It's tonight?

Yeah, it's tonight.
"Blade Runner,"

Both versions, back to back
down at the Southfield.

Starts at 12:30.

Wake up, 'cause
it's time to die.

Oh, well, you're
overlooking one

Very important point there, JT.

We don't get out of
here till 10:30, man.

By the time we get
down to the Southfield,

The show is going
to be sold out.

This is true.

So how are we going to get in?

Tickets went on sale
at 7:00 this morning.

Guess who slept on the
sidewalk to get 'em.

You slept on the sidewalk?

Hell yeah, I slept
on the sidewalk.

This is "Blade Runner" we're
talking about here, all right?

I would have driven
across the Sahara

In the trunk of a New York
taxicab if that's what it took.

Oh.

Hey, ask her is she
needs some help, man.

She doesn't, all right?

Not from me.

Is this any good?

I hate him already.

Oh, I don't know.

What about this one?

I haven't seen it.

You know what I thought
was a really good movie?

I really...

Lady, listen.

The words are running a
marathon through my mind.

Can you guess what they are?

Did I ask.

Well, I'm Michelle.

And you are?

Not even remotely interested.

Yeah, keep walking, Michelle.

Smartest move you've ever made.

[Phone ringing]

Video Zone, "Batman
and Robin" sucks.

How can I help you?

Hey, Mikey.

What's up?

Oh, no.

No, man.

No, no, no, no.

You're killing me, Mikey.

You're fucking killing me.

Are you sure it's broken?

Have you tried walking it off?

Have you tried a cane?

Have you tried a wheelchair?

Have you tried crutches?

What about that thing that goes,
uh, that goes under the cars.

The creeper.
Have you tried a creeper, Mikey?

Try a creeper, man.

All right, all right.

Well, how long are
you going to be out?

Six weeks?

What are you fucking kidding me?

I slept on the
sidewalk last night

And you're going to be down
for the count for six weeks?

No, I can't drive.

My car's in the shop.

No, Ryan walked here.

The bus?

What are you fucking kidding me?

The bus is the
abnormal express, man.

Have you been taking long
dips in the idiot pool?

Have you seen people
that ride the bus?

Let me tell you something, man.

People that ride the bus
almost always have shoes

With Velcro on 'em, all right?

Mikey, you're
killing me here, man.

Come on, we've got
to do s... hello?

Hello?


What's going on?

He's not picking us up.

submarine, you can't catch

Me in my yellow submarine.

Don't look at them, honey.

want to do is...

is crossbreed lions and tigers.

I mean, that's all
they want to do.

it, it will be sheep, people.

Where do we draw the line?

I mean, before you know it,
we're all going to be digested

In the bowels of progress.

Wha... yeah, this is good.

Really good.

I like that.

Nice.

Yeah.


Hey, what the
hell are you doing?

I... I wanted to watch a video.

Yeah, well, you've got
to pay for it first.


Can't catch me in
my yellow submarine.

Hey, you got some
family I can call?

Mom and dad, rest in peace.

Baby sitter gets
letters in California.

Sister... sister loves
the... uh... bananas.

Or bottles.

Beetles!

Yeah.

Beetles.

Doesn't like a brother, though.

He... too weird.

Too weird.

Too crazy.

What about some friends?

You got some friends I can call?

One friend.

Only one who notices.

Only one who listens.

Only one who cares.

OK.

We're gonna...

Mm.

Want to see a picture?

Hm?

No, I don't need
to see a picture.

OK.
Hm?

Go on, go on.

Have a look, man.

That's right here.

This is your best friend.

Because he listens to me, man.

Don't look at him, honey!

He's crazy!

Nobody notices a crazy man.

Nobody thinks I notice them
not noticing, but I do!

I do.

Right.

Nobody listens except for Ted.

me in my yellow submarine.

OK.



Fuckin' bananas.


How the hell did
he break his leg?

Mikey left his marijuana
in a drawer in his room.

His dog got in the room,
got into the marijuana,

Spread it all over the floor.

Wait a minute.

His dog got into it?

You've seen his dog.

It's the jaws of
Labrador retrievers.

One time it ate an entire
rosebush, thorns and all.

Imagine having to shit that out.

Shit.

Well, so what happened?

What do you think happened?

Mikey's dad came
home, and there laying

On the floor was the dog,
stoned out of its mind.

Oh, shit.

So what happened then?

Oh, Mikey started... Mikey
starts running from his dad.

His dad's chasing
him around the house.

I mean, he's booking like
Tom and fucking Jerry.

Or he's running like Speedy
Gonzales on Benzedrine.

All right, already.

Christ, enough with
the cartoon metaphors.

Anyway, anyway, Mikey
ended up tripping on his leg

And breaking it.

No leg, no Mike,
no ride, no movie.

Hey, Alex.

Yeah?

You drove here, right?

ALEX: Why?

What are you doing after work?

I'm telling you,
that's what I read.

Where?

In one of those medical
journals, the... the New

England something or other.

What did it say?

It said, in one of
the recent studies,

They found eye drops
to be addictive.

Really?
Yeah.

I'm serious.

It said the more eye drops
you use, the quicker your eyes

Dry out, because
of the chemicals.

Therefore, the...

No, no, no, no, no.

Hence.

What?

Hence, not therefore.

All right, motherfucker.

Hence, the more chemicals your
eyes depend on to remain moist.

Therefore...

It has to be a conspiracy.

Therefore.

Therefore, the more eye
drops you need to buy.

It's a goddamn conspiracy.

You know what?

Someone should put a
warning label on that.

I mean, no one gives a
shit about that until too

Many people are hooked or dead.

Lucky cigarettes,
hand to god, it

Seemed like the whole
world was smoking

Them in the '40s and '50s.

Christ, I remember
doctors advertising...

W... wait... w...
W... wait a minute.

What do you mean, you remember?

The '40s and '50s, man, your
mom wasn't even a fetus.

He means he remembers
hearing about them.

God, JT, you're
so damn critical.

Like that time you made
that kid cry because he

Said me instead of I.

So?

He was fuckin'
four years old, man.

That's more the point, man.

People should say what they
mean and mean what they say.

Do you have any
idea how many people

Come into my store
absolutely convinced

That the word combat
is spelled with a K?

Do you have any idea how many
more people come to my store

Absolutely fucking
convinced that showering

Is strictly an annual thing?

Do you have any idea how many
people come into my store

Not being able to
pronounce the word trilogy?

Oh, I'll give you that one.

I mean, no one can
pronounce that damn word.

I mean, it's like I
told him, all right?

90% of the world is stupid.

The other 10%, me, you...
I don't really know you,

Alex, so I can't really comment.

But me, you, we carry
the rest of everybody.

But you know, it's
a video store, JT.

It's not a government
think tank.

Yeah, I gotta go
with Ryan on this one.

I mean, don't you think
you're being... I don't know,

Over critical?

I'm not asking that everybody
who comes in the store

Be a fuckin' Final
Jeopardy contestant.

I'm just asking that when they
put down a job application

On my desk, that A,
they're not pierced so much

They look like Pinhead from
fucking Hell Raiser series,

And B, when I ask them whether
they speak a foreign language,

The only thing they
put down is they're

Fluent in fucking Klingon, man.

You're not asking too much
if this was a perfect world.

Thank you.

See?

Thing is JT, it's not a
perfect world, you know?

Uh-oh.

What?

It's overheating.

Why is it doing that?

It's got a leak.

It needs a new
radiator, and I thought

I'd hold out till payday.

Ah, sh... [grunts]

Uh.

We're um... we're stalled.

Yeah, thank you, JT.

Know anything about cars?

Can you fuck a car?

I...

Can you fuck a car?

No.

Then why would I need to
know anything about cars?

OK.

What about you?

Do I... do I look like the
owner of Harley's Garage?

All right, come on.

Where are we going?

I saw a gas station
a few blocks back.

We're going to get
some antifreeze

And hope the car makes
it to the theater.

Did I ever tell you about
the one about the dead bunny?

Yeah, well, this kid's pet bunny
dies, so he gives it to his dad

To bury in the backyard.

His dad's like, OK.

Go to school, and I'll have
it buried in the backyard

Before you get home.

So the kid goes to school,
and his dad made soup

For dinner that night. [Laughs]

Pretty good one, huh?

11:15?

Over at the theater?

Yeah.

Oh man, I can't wait to see it.

I haven't seen that
in so long, man.

Yeah, OK.
Well, I gotta go, man.

I've got to lock up.

All right?

See you there.

OK, bye.

Hey, look.

This will only
take a second, man.

I'm sorry, fellas,
but I'm closed.

Aw, come on.

My car broke down.

I just need to get
some antifreeze.

I just closed out my register.

I can't ring anybody
up until tomorrow.

I was just about
to lock the door.

Jesus.

Nothing I can do for
you until tomorrow.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Come on, man.

Sorry.

Oh, we're broke down out there.

Ah.

Sorry, fellas.

Come on, man.

Jesus Christ, man.

Come on.

Y'all have a good night.

Oh, thanks.

Yeah, thanks for
nothing, you goofy

Jabba the Hutt motherfucker!

Hey, shut the hell up, JT.

He's just doing his job, man.

I've seen you do the
same thing before.

Aw, fuck him, man.

He's one of those people
that are so annoying,

You think you could
fucking kill him, man.

You hear that?

You're just like birds
that shit on your car

Five minutes after
you get it washed.

You are at the top
of my list of people

To choke the living shit out of.

Will you shut up?

Look at that chin, man.

He's a muppet-chin bastard.

You're telling me he doesn't
look like something Jim

Henson created?

That make you feel good, boy?

Make you feel superior?

I've been made fun of by a
lot worse punks than you.

All I know is you're
one mean son of a bitch.

I'm just trying to
do my job, mister.

[Bird singing]


Well, that fuckin' bird
read my mind. [Laughs]

Now what the hell
are we supposed to do?

Oh, well, shit,
Stephen Hawking,

I would have thought you'd
have it all figured out by now.

I mean, it seems like your
keen intellects are... hey,

Has anyone ever told you
you're a real smart ass?

Yeah?

Eat me.

All right.

Hey, Alex, Alex, back
the hell up, man.

What, are you siding with him?

Were you not here
just a minute ago?

He almost got us into
a fight with a guy who

Weighed as much as a small jet.

Look, we don't need a
blow-by-blow, all right, man?

We were all here.

We all know what happened.

So what do you say we stop
remembering how we got here

And start focusing on a way
to get out of this mess.

Now, where are we?

11 and Grassion.

Why?

Because I know somebody
who might help us out.

Harrison Ford.

Now, he's a cool guy.

I mean, easily one of my
all-time favorite cinematic

Good guys.

I mean, well, he's not...
You know, built, right?

But he's decisive.

Tough.

Fearless.

Harrison Ford said jump, you
said out of which window.

I mean, when me and
JT were younger...

No, no.

JT and I. No, no, no, no, no.

Well, when JT and
I were younger,

I was actually littler than JT.

I mean, I wasn't like an
Oompa Loompa or nothing.

But I was kind of small.

So for the longest
time, Harrison Ford

Was my role model.

True?

True.

I think the thing
I like best though

Is the way that
Harrison Ford plays

His characters like a badass.

But he never acts like a badass.

He just is.

And nowadays,
anytime a character

Wants to show you how tough
they are, they... they... they...

They spend 12 hours a day in
the gym for a couple of months,

And then they tear their shirts
off within the first act,

Just so they can show
you how bad they are.

It is... all this showing off.

Look at me.
I'm bad.

I'm tough.

Eh, eh.

I mean, and then they
do these photo spreads

In these magazines, right?

Featuring their
ass and their pecs

And their forearms,
front and center.

Don't these guys
have any pride left?

Christ, you'd never
see Harrison Ford

On the cover of a
magazine with nothing

But a leaf over his schlong.

And do you know why?

Because he's got the goods.

He knows it and we know it.

All those pretty boy
actors out there know it.

And he doesn't have to
prove anything to us.

Am I wrong or what?

Oh, no.

You make a valid point.

Yeah?
Yeah, man.

I feel the same way
about Jimmy Dean.

Ooh, Jimmy Dean.

That is a good one.

He is a man's man.

So whose house is this
we're going to, anyway?

My girlfriend's.

My ex-girlfriend, actually.

What, did she like, kick
you out or something?

It's none of your
goddamn concern.

Hey, come on, man.

Sorry.

It's a sensitive area, I guess.

That was weird.

Hey, hey, hey.

Hey.

Listen man, I'm... I'm
short a couple of bucks.

You guys got any money
I can borrow, huh?

Sorry, fellas.

Can't help you out.


This can go through a car
door, and it sure as hell

Can go through you.

Now, you sure you don't have a
couple of bucks I can borrow,

Huh?
Look, just put the knife down.


Did you hear what he said?


What'd you say?

Put the knife down,
you won't get hurt.



Are you gonna be as
uh... dumb as your friend?

Or do you have uh, some
money I can borrow?

Come on.

Jack.

What?

Shit.

Holy shit.

Ah!

Ah! [Screaming]

Ah!

You fucking killed them.

Look, I know this
looks bad, all right?

You know, I'm not
happy about it.

But I had to do it.

It was self-defense.

It was kill or be killed.

I didn't do this for fun.

I didn't do this for
shits and giggles.

I had to do it.

Had I not done it,
you two would have

Been dead on a morgue slab.

But they fuckin'
stabbed you, man!

Look, there's only two
ways to kill a vampire.

Sunlight and a wooden
stake to the heart.

All that coffins and Bella
Lugosi shit, that shit.

W... wait.

Vam... vampire?

Did you say vampire?

That's right.

Syllable for
syllable what I said.

That's bullshit, man.

If you're a vampire, where
are your fuckin' fangs?

I had them filed down.

I kept biting my lip.
Now, come on.

Let's go.

Oh no.

Prove you're a vampire.

I did it to A and
B. Now, come on.

You fucking... if you're worried
about me killing you, don't.

I would have done
that an hour ago.

Look, you gonna come with me?

Or are you going
to wait until A,

The police, or B, some of their
friends find these fuckers?

Well, come on!

Look, he's right, JT.

I mean, this isn't the
best neighborhood to be in.

[Police sirens]

We're trying something.

Don't worry, man.

Dude, you're
covered by the best.

You know that.

How many fights have
I gotten in for you?

How many have I won?

Huh?

Come on.

So she's a vampire too?

Yeah.

How many goddamn
vampires are there?

Let's just say you'd
never sleep if you knew.

What?

Are you nervous
or something, man?

Why?

Because... because you
look like you're going

To have an aneurysm.

Why did you guys break up?

Well, you're going to
find out soon enough,

So I might as well tell you.

Adia left me for another guy.

In fact, you might know him.

Jack Daniels.


If it isn't Travis Bickle.

This is a switch.

Usually I don't get
to see your face.

Usually, it's your breath I hear
on the other end of my phone

At 3:00 in the morning.

Oh, that's bullshit.
I haven't done that since...

Since what?

Tuesday?

Can we come in?


We're not... we're not
starting that again.

ALEX: Starting what?

Two weeks ago, you
come back claiming

You want your toothpaste.

Fine.

Maybe you're a little
anal about dental hygiene.

Then you come back a
week later, claiming

I have one of your socks?

I'm not buying
this anymore, Alex.

Do yourself a favor.

Get yourself a hobby,
a dog, some Thorazine,

Whatever it takes for you to
realize that this is over.

I don't want you anymore.
No.

What you mean is you
want someone who's

Going to sit around and tell
you that being a fucking drunk

Is the greatest thing in the
world, and everything you do

Is just perfect.

Get the hell out of here.

Come on, look, Courtney Love.

I just need some
goddamn antifreeze.

Our car broke down a ways back.

And then I'm out of
your life for good.

You can go back to living this
four star existence of yours.

You're lucky as hell
Slain's not awake.

Who's Slain?

Do we go in?

I don't know.

I'm not familiar with
vampire etiquette.

I didn't bring my Anne
Rice decoder ring.

Well, let's just make
sure we take our shoes off.

Eh?

Yeah.

Who the hell is Slain?

Will you shut up.

I'm trying to watch this.

He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

OK, I'll take that as a yes.

Look, maybe we should go.

Where the hell do you get
off fucking another guy?

You're my girlfriend.

No, Alex.
No.

I was once your girlfriend.

Once being the
operative word, here.

I'm not anymore.

Oh, once my girlfriend.

I see.

Kind of like you
were once sober?

lost your touch, have you Alex?

You still know how to make me
feel like 40 miles of bad road.

We should go.

It's obvious it wasn't
such a hot idea.

And if I'm such
a fucking drunk,

Then why can't you get
over me dumping you?

Uh, take a wild guess.

Oh.

Wait.

Slain's car.

Go take it to your car.

Put some antifreeze in it.

Bring it back later.

Be careful of the brakes.

They stick every now and again.

Slain won't mind?

Slain's not gonna know.

He was out late last night.

Barely made it in by dawn.

Does he take care of you?

I've come to the
conclusion that no one is

Ever going to take care of me.

But he brings home
blood every night.

He works at a hospital and he
steals blood from the bank.

You know how that goes.

Yeah, but is he good to you?

Good enough, I guess.

Kind of depends on his
mood, but... um, look.

I really don't want him
to find you guys in here,

So do you think...

Yeah, come on guys.

Antifreeze in the garage?

Alex?

I'm sorry I don't feel
the same way about...

Christ, man.

She shoulda just hooked
herself up to an IV of Absolute

And been done with it.

She made Cage in
"Leaving Las Vegas"

Look like a leading
candidate for rehab.

You dated that lush?

She wasn't always like that.

So how long did you two date?

It would have been
31 years next month.

Right after my
first tour in Nam.

In the beginning,
things were great.

Better than great.

Things were phenomenal.

Then she starts spiking her
nightly feeds with vodka tonic.

Soon she wouldn't even
want to drink blood.

It became impossible to tell
which one she was more addicted

To, vodka tonic because
she was an alchie,

Or blood because she was a vamp.

So you like loved her, huh?

So what about you?

Anyone serious?

wrong horse there, Count.

Why?

What do you mean?

I haven't exactly had many
of what one could define

As serious relationships.

OK, well, how long
do they usually last?


Hours?

Did you say hours?

Well, one time I stayed
with this girl for 14 hours,

But that was because she
forgot to set her alarm clock.

I hope you're
buckling up, Ryan.


I mean, imagine having to
live forever with AIDS.

Even vamps are scared of that.

Yeah, I buckle up.

It's just... well, I like sex.

What's wrong with that?
Nothing.

I just hope you're not
promising these women anything.

No, no, no, no.

In fact, the way I see
it, I'm giving these women

A valuable lifelong lesson.

How do you figure that?

Look, here's how I see it.

Uh, women don't like to gamble.

Ah, Christ.

They like a safe bet.

They see a good looking
guy like me... now, I'm not

Saying that to be egotistical.
Oh.

I am just stating a
commonly known fact.

OK?

And they see me
buying them drinks,

And the little hamster on
the wheel starts turning.

They figure, hey, maybe
if I give this guy

A little something
tonight, he'll

Give me a lot of something
for the rest of my life.

Maybe if I sleep with
this guy tonight,

He'll fall in love with me,
and he'll take care of my ass

Forever.

You follow me so far?

It's a struggle, but yeah.

All right.

Now, you don't
have to be fucking

Prophet to predict that
ain't ever going to happen.

Why is that?

Because the way
I see it, no man

Can fall for a
woman who he sleeps

With on their initial meeting,
because he automatically

Assumes that if she'll
sleep with his creepy ass,

There might have been hundreds,
even thousands before him.

He figures, fucking
her is like going

To the Secretary of State.

All I've got to do
is pick a number,

And eventually I'll get served.

See, I teach women
that they should never,

Under any circumstances,
sleep with someone

That they've just met, because
nothing will ever come of it.

Ever.

Small price to pay to
teach women that lesson.

I mean, if I gotta be that
guy, then I gotta be that guy.

Well, what do you think?

Well, I think you
sound like Woody Allen.

Oh, how's that?

Well, you'd never be
part of a club that

Would have you as a member.

Aw, shit.

The trunk came loose.

[Clearing throat]


JT, w... what's
wrong with you, man?

You don't... oh, fuck me!

This guys' a vamp.

What?

Someone staked him
through the heart.

What's your girlfriend
driving around with the body

Of a dead vampire in here for?

It's not Adia's car.

It's Slain's.

Slain?

Wait, wait, wait.

Who's Slain?

Her new boyfriend.

Weren't you paying
attention back there?


What's this?

Blood.

It's his vamp blood, type AB.

You can tell all that
just by sniffing it?

Yeah, it's one of our gifts.

This one's labeled B.

Yeah.


These are all vamp blood.

Why the hell would somebody,
if they were a vampire,

Want to go around, kill,
and bleed other vampires?

That's not the strange thing.

The strange thing is why
he's storing all their blood.

Well, could it... could it be
like some kind of a drug thing?

Oh my...

No, I mean, like, is... is
vampire blood like cocaine,

Whereas human blood's
like Maxwell House?

No, no, no.

See, vamp blood
actually tastes worse.

The only time we
drink it is when we

Can't get our hands on humans.

OK.

So it's like when you buy
the off brand headache stuff

Because you don't
have the money to buy

The ass kicking Excedrin.

Yeah.

It's Kind of
something like that.


Yeah, what for?

Hey, come on.

Come on.

Hey, wait.

SLAIN: Where's the car?

[Phone ringing]

Where's the fucking car, Adia?

Hello?

Adia, get out of
the house, now.

Alex, you've got to bring that
car back, like, immediately.

Is Slain awake?

Is he standing there?

Yeah, on... on both counts.

Adia, listen very carefully.

We found the body of a
vamp in Slain's trunk.

Now, [inaudible] but we
found a cooler full of vamp

Blood in [inaudible] trunk.

Now, [inaudible].

I'm telling you, your
boy's a fuckin' psycho!

Get out of the
house, you hear me?

Am I on the damn speakerphone?

Adia!

Fuck!


I say a lot of shit about Adia.

I mean, when you get dumped,
you say a lot of serial killer

Shit, you know?

I mean, there were
times I wanted her dead

Or at least seriously injured.

I mean, there were times
that I was saying, man,

It's better for her
to break up with me.

My life is better without her.

I don't need to
be drying her out

Every night, getting
her out of fights.

There were lots of
nights I sat around

Saying, why am I doing this?

She's my girlfriend,
not my daughter.

Why am I tucking her in?

Then I'd see her
the next morning,

And before she hit the bottle,
I didn't need to ask why.

Adia!

Adia!

Adia.

Adia!

Wake the fuck up.

Come on, pretty girl.

Wake the fuck up.

Wake up, Adia.

She's cold.

Get her a blanket.

Get her a goddamn blanket!

Come on, Adia.

JT: Alex...
Wake up.

JT: She's gone.

Adia, wake the fuck up, Adia!

RYAN: She's gone, man.

Wake up, girl.

Wake up.

Hey, hey, somebody's getting
something out of the trunk.

Slain?

Mph!

Why'd you kill her?

Ah!

Because it's not finished!

Oh, shit.

Jesus Christ, he's
a fuckin' psychopath.

Forget about it.

Alex, you're going to
get yourself killed, man.

Come on.

[Car engine]


This is what has to happen.

What happened to me has
to happen to others.

Then everyone will
feel what it's like.

Everyone will understand.

Jesus Christ, what
the hell are you doing?

Alex is back there.

Hey, does this
car have air bags?

Why?

Remember how Adia said the
brakes stick from time to time?

Yeah?

Yeah, well, this is
one of those times.

Ah, shit.

Turn the wheel!

What?

And flip the car over?

Oh, fuck me.

Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

Oh no.

Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with... fuck!

Fuck!

What comes after thee?

[Tires squealing]

[Door opening]

Where'd he go?
I don't know.

He ran off.

You guys came here, pulling
up here like the guns

Of the fucking Navarone.

Fuck!

Paging David Helfgott.

David Helfgott, you have
a call at the front desk.

Jesus Christ.

what the fuck, JT?

That's lovely.

What are you... what
are you looking for?

Anything that will
help us find him.

Us?

Now way.

What do you... what
do you mean, us?

Oh, no.

This whole... no.

This whole thing has
nothing to do with us.

What the...

Alex!

Take it easy!

Vampire or no vampire,
you're going to put him down.

Now!

Adia is dead because
of what we found out.

We!

Now, I don't know what
this lame fucker's up to,

But if he's willing to
kill his own kind over it,

You gotta know it was
pretty goddamn serious.

Look, Alex, I just...
I don't think I'm

Up for this kind of thing.

Look, I know you
must be floating

In a lake of our own
piss by about now,

Judging by what
you've seen tonight.

And for that, I apologize.

I mean, you wanted a
ride to the movies,

And you got psychotic vampires.

But I gotta tell you,
I'm getting the vibe

That whatever Slain is up to, he
wants to hurt a lot of people.

So you're just going to have
to chew some action hero gum

And rise to the
fucking occasion.

And you're right.

It shouldn't be up to us.

Just like that fuckin'
show "Full House" shouldn't

Have ran eight goddamn years.

And just like Bob
Saget shouldn't

Be dating Dana fucking Delany.

Just like I shouldn't
be what I am.

Just like Adia
shouldn't be dead.

But she is.

It's not a perfect world, JT.

Now is a good as time as any
to start dealing with that.

People are dying, man.

All right.

Christ, I'm in.

Yeah, me too.

All right, well, help
me find something.

Start looking around.

Fucking shit in here.

What the hell's that?

Diagrams on the most
effective way to bleed someone.

In this case, vamps.

You see this?

This is a list of maps.

Irwin Gallagher, AB.

Jason Podsiadlik, type
A. David Kraszevski,

Type B. Marcus Thoel, type O.

And all the... yeah.

And all the ones except
Marcus Thoel are checked off.

Yeah, because he hasn't
gotten to Thoel yet.

The old bottles in the cooler
were... were still empty.

I'd be willing to bet
major parts of my anatomy

That's where he's headed, folks.

Do you know Marcus Thoel?

Yeah, I've heard of him.

I mean, then again, vamps have
heard of just about everyone

Somewhere down the line.

You ever hear of Slain?

No.

So if you don't know him, how
are we going to find this guy?

I mean, it's not like you can
go to your local vampire hangout

And ask around to see
if anybody knows him.

Actually, it's a lot like that.

Here?

Yup.

Jeez.

Shit.

Password.

Oldman.

Alex?

Shit.

I didn't expect to
see you around here.

You usually get yours delivered.

Yeah, well, you know what
they say about first times.

My god.

It's Bram Stoker's Cheers.


Don't piss anybody off
in here, or else you just

Might get to see your spine.

Get the picture?

Well, I'll be a little,
skinny soppy's uncle.

see you standing by in my bar,

There, Mr. Leery.

Well?

What can I get for you?

Um, what's fresh?

Well, we've got a whole
bunch of O negative

That came from an accident
down on Woodward Avenue,

And actually, I've got some
A that I got at a blood bank

Over at the uh... Red Cross.

Everything else, day old.

Give me a large O.

On the rocks or warm?

Warm.

How about for your friends?

Oh, ha, we're
trying to cut back.

Thanks.

There you are.

Hey, can I talk to
you if you have time?

Yeah, OK.

Let me just take care of these
guys that just walked in.

I'll be right back in a minute.
Yeah, all right.

I'll be here.

So.

So this is... this
is how you do it.

I mean, you know, this
is how you stay alive?

Yeah, most of the time.

What about the
rest of the time?

Look, if you're asking whether
I've killed people to stay

Alive, the answer is yes.

But the people I have killed
were all sex offenders

And murderers and worse.

OK?

Does that ease your conscience?

Well, maybe about you, but what
about everybody else in here?

ALEX: That's their business.

Wait, wait.

So everybody in here could be
killing innocent people, just

Random guys, like
me and JT, and you

Don't have a problem with that?

What's so funny?

Look, let me tell you a story.

This man is trapped
in the middle

Of the desert with this other
guy, and this guy's a stranger.

A guy you couldn't
pick out of a lineup.

They are both... they've
been walking for days,

And both men know that
they're going to die.

And one day, when they're
dehydrating near death,

This figure appears.

I mean, Christ, Moses,
Charlton Heston.

Whatever.

And this figure
kills the first guy.

I will lead you out of the
desert, and you can live,

And all you have to do is
kill the stranger next to you.

My question to you
is what do you do?

Do you die for the
stranger next to you,

Who would probably kill you if
he had the same opportunity?

Would you kill him
to save yourself?

That's different.

ALEX: How?

That's necessary.

ALEX: For what, survival?

For us, killing is sometimes
necessary for survival.

Now, while I don't agree
with the practice of killing

Innocent people, I'm not
going to stand in the way

Of the survival of a vamp.

Wait, so that's
how you justify it?

All right, look.

I can't speak for all
the vamps in here,

But I can say the
ones I've encountered,

They don't like to
kill innocent people.

It's usually their last choice.

But while they don't like
killing, they sure as hell

Don't like dying.

So do you like it?

Do you like being a... a vampire?

Well, I don't
suppose it's something

Anybody likes, unless they're
stupid or crazy or in denial.

But I can say I've
honestly come to accept it.

What about other ones?

I don't know.

Each one... each one has their
own way of coping with it.

I mean, some, like Adia, drink
their way into acceptance.

Others go fucking crazy.

And then there's others that
just find healthy ways to cope.

RYAN: Like how?

Support groups.

Get the hell out of here.

ALEX: No, I'm serious.

Every Mondays and Wednesdays,
here in the basement.

Have you ever gone?

No.

Any particular reason?

Probably the same reason why
I don't like coming in here.

JT: Which is?

Whenever I come in
here, I'm constantly

Reminded by everything
I see of what I am.

I mean, there are
times I just don't

Want to be reminded of that.

There are times I
just want to pretend,

Just for a little while, that
I'm just like everybody else.

Hey Alex, what's up?

Got some bad news, Tommy.

Adia was killed tonight.

Oh, Alex.

I'm sorry.

Well, I mean, I... I know
things weren't going really

Good for you two at
the end, but I know

You really cared about her.

So... so who did this?

I mean, I'll go out and I'll rip
that fucker's heart out myself,

You know?

I mean...

It's not that simple, Tommy.

She wasn't killed by a human.

She was killed by another vamp.

A vamp killing another vamp?

Oh, what the fuck is
going on with our world?

I mean, jeez, who did this?

I don't know.

Slain something or other.

Her boyfriend.

You know anybody by that name?

No, no.

I don't know anybody like that.

Oh, well.

Just keep your ears to
the tracks, all right?

TOMMY: Yeah, yeah.

I can do that for you.

Hey, is uh... is Clyde here?

You want to see Clyde?

Well, not especially,
but he knows everybody.

Well, yeah.

He... after... he came in after
the game, about 15 minutes ago.

He should be down by the back.

Thanks, Tommy.

TOMMY: Hey, uh, Alex, I'm
really sorry about Adia.

Watch it.

I'm sorry.

Yeah, well, watch
where you're... Ryan?

Is that you?

Uh, yeah.

You don't even
remember me, do you?

No, I don't.

I should have expected as much.

I slept with you.

What?

When?

A month ago.

You slept with a vampire?

You never told me about that.

Look, not now, JT.

Because he didn't know
that I was a vampire.

The club was dark, and we both
had a few too many drinks.

Didn't we, Ryan?

You remember what you
told me, don't you?

You said we were going to date.

You said we were going to
get together that Tuesday.

That's a fucking quote.

Look, I thought you said you
never lied to these girls.

You said you never
promised them anything.

You really picked the wrong
girl to change your policy on.

You know, I could have handled
it if you would have just told

Me it was a one night stand.

I like sex as much
as the next girl.

You know why I didn't
bite you that night?

Because I liked you.

I liked you and I didn't
want to see you become this.

But after what you
did that next morning,

You sneaking out of my house
like a goddamn cat burglar

Before the sun was even up,
I thought about finding you,

And I thought about
killing you or biting you.

I hadn't decided which one,
but you can bet your ass

I wanted to do something.

I was up nights
thinking about it.

I thought maybe if I
did that, you'd know

How I felt that next morning.

How fucking betrayed I felt.
But then I got to thinking,

How many other women
have you done this to?

How many other women have
you slept with 34 seconds

After meeting them?

Your Rolodex is the
goddamn yellow pages.

I didn't want one of the 108
diseases you probably have

And be forced to
live forever with it.

I didn't want to get sick.

Not over you.

You're just not worth
getting sick over.

Yeah, maybe you
should go wait outside.

We don't want any
trouble with these guys.

Leaving alone?

What?

Well, I just figured a good
looking guy like you might

Be going home with somebody.


Not tonight.

You know, she's right, asshole.

It's all shit.


You realize that
you've single-handedly

Shattered the stereotype that
homosexuals are thin and neat.

Well, well, well.

Senator Leary.

To what do I owe this honor?

Senator?

Don't worry, he
calls everybody names.

He thinks it's clever.

Well, can we sit?

Free country.

So who's your friend?

He's kind of cute, even
if he isn't a vamp.

Of course, I can change that.

I'm gonna go sit at the bar.

OK.

Is that guy a mortal?

Yeah.

Never ceases to amaze me.

What?

He knew that I could rip out
his throat in half a second,

But he wasn't scared.

He wasn't scared of the
fact that I'm a vamp.

He's scared of the
fact that I'm gay.

I can't understand
that about you guys.

You straight men think that
if you come within 100 yards

Of a gay man, the next
morning, you'll simply wake up

And you'll be a queer.

It's just balls.

I'll tell you why not.

No halfway for you.

You're not gonna say
you're bi or experimenting.

You're just...

Bi.

What a fucking joke.

Bisexual people are people
that can't get their asses

Off the fucking fence.

Saying that you're
bi is like saying you

Aren't Democrat or Republican.

Or like the people that stand
in the fucking grocery line

For 20 fucking minutes,
trying to decide

Between paper or plastic.

Bisexual is a synonym
for indecisive asshole.

So who won the game?

Milwaukee.

Detroit finally makes
it to the playoffs,

And now they decide to put
in the unproven reliever

Two days out from the minors.

Somebody there is having
stupid sandwiches,

And that's for damn sure.

What did you do to your teeth?

I had them filed down.

Figures.

What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

What it means,
Senator, is you're not

Living your life to
the full accordance

Of the facts of your existence.

Look, I didn't ask
you to make me a vamp.

Whether you did or didn't
is a moot fucking point.

You are one, so act like one.

Vamps don't associate
with mortals

Or hold down jobs or
file their fangs down.

Look, I didn't come here
to listen to you tell me

What I should and should not do
with this so-called funny life

Of mine.

Then what the hell
did you come here for?

Put me on the Guilt
Express for turning you?

Senator, that foxhole was
surrounded by Germans.

And if I hadn't intervened,
you'd be nothing more

But a toe with a tag on it.

Intervened?

I saved your life, Senator.

You would have died.

Yeah, I did die.

Single teardrop
rolling down my cheek.

Another vamp
killed Adia tonight.

What can I do?

Hi, what's your name?

Joseph, but people call me JT.

What's a mortal like you
doing in a place like this?

This is a joke, right?

What?

Your friends put you
up to this, didn't they?

What?

You don't think I
know how it goes?

I know what happened.

Your friends put you up to this.

Your friends told
you to come over

To this guy who looks like he
weighs four and a half pounds,

Is balding, and looks
like the bastard child

Of the leprechaun on the
front of the Lucky Charms box.

What?

You don't think this
has happened before?

You don't think
I know your game?

I know what you're thinking.

I know what women think of me.

I know what everybody
thinks of me, all right?

I'm an asshole.

I'm an overcritical asshole.

I don't need to
be reminded of it.

So why don't you just go
back to your vampire buddies,

Because you ain't going
to get the reaction

You're looking for out of me.

You don't give
yourself enough credit.

I don't give anyone
enough credit.

At least I'm consistent.

ALEX: So you've never
heard of a guy named Slain?

CLYDE: No.

And I know everyone.

You sure he's a vamp?

Yeah, his fangs were
an inch from my face.

Man, he's got to be new.

I mean, really new.

Like, two months.

What about a guy
named Marcus Thoel?

Marc?
Oh, yeah.

I know Marc.

Me and him used to run
together during the Civil War.

Man, I haven't seen
him in a long time.

You know, he used to come
in here all the time.

He helped me open up this place.

Man, me and Marc used to
talk about how we were

Going to dust this fucking...

Clyde... look, you
obviously have me mistaken

With someone who gives a shit.

Do you have his address?

Yeah.

Somewhere.

Man, I really do need to
go through this more often.

William Howard Taft, Pyotr
Tchaikovsky, William Tell.

Marcus Thoel.

Thanks.

You know, Senator, you could
come around here a little

More often.

I miss you.


What, nobody's home?

Let's go around back.

All right, I'm going
to check downstairs.

You check the upstairs.

Why don't you check over there.

Look, if you see something,
don't be like Bruce Willis,

All right?
Just scream.

Ooh!

Oh, fuck.

Fuck.

Ah!

Fuck!

Fuck!

Jesus Christ.

What the... oh, man.

Oh.

What the hell is this?

It's part of his ear.

Could things get
any more repulsive?

I mean, honestly.

All right?

I feel like an editor on
the "Faces of Death" movie.

I'm going to go wash
my hands and vomit.

I'll be right back.

It's a note.

What does it say?

He started it.

This is the vamp
that turned Slain.

This is Slain's revenge.

Uh, how do you know that?

Because this guy was tortured.

Look, his eyes are
crazy glued shut.

Paper cuts on his face.

The Mike Tyson ear job.

The fact that he was beaten
severely, all before he

Was staked.

The guy we found in the car
wasn't anything like this.

That was more professional,
more methodical.

This, this is the work
of a fuckin' psychopath.

Oh, that's Slain, all right.

The IV marks are
still in his arm.

This seems much more
personal, you know?

I mean, every vamp goes through
a stage where they want to kill

The vamp that turned them.

And this guy just acted
on that fucking impulse

To the tenth fucking power.

The guy we found in the trunk
didn't look anything like this.

So what do you think?

It's type O. That's
the type he needed.

And obviously, he's been bled.

I still don't get it.

But why?

Why is he bleeding vampires?

Thank you.

Why store vamp blood?

There's gotta be something
we're overlooking.

No, you're not overlooking
anything, Count.

All right?

They guy's a fuckin' psycho.

All right?

And psychos, they don't
need reasons for anything.

I read this one
story, true story,

Where this guy was
cutting off people's dicks

And serving them
in hot dog buns.

Yeah, I'm done eating.

I gotta go take a shit.

Oh, duly noted.

I'll call the Times.


How the hell can you be
friends with that asshole?

Come on, man.
He's drunk right now.

Give him a break.

No, that's no excuse.

He's been an overcritical,
know-it-all prick all night.

That's before he had
a drop of alcohol.

So what gives?

I don't know.

You ever hear the cliche,
old habits die hard?

Yeah.

Well, cliches only going to
be cliches when they're true.

Can you elaborate?

Do you want the long
story or the Cliffs Notes?

Cliffs Notes.

See, me and JT went to
grade school together.

And back then, I was little.

I mean, like 4' 11", and
I weighed about as much

As a small dog.

Right?

Strong winds could blow me...
Hey, Christ.

I get it.
Come on.

Anyways, one day,
this inbred ass fucker

Is screwing with me
for what must have

Been the 50th time that week.

He's asking me for
my shoes, asking me

For my money, yada, yada, yada.

JT busts out like
fuckin' Batman, right?

I mean, he does a real
ass whipping on this guy.

He used his face as a mop.

And after that, we
just started talking.

He told me about how he likes
watching movies in letter box

And how much he
hates pan and scan.

I told him I felt the same
way, and that was that.

No, no.

Not exactly.

And I want to know where Captain
Sarcasm got his big mouth from.

Can you answer me that one?

It's the way he's always been.

What can I tell you, man?

Puberty hit JT really early.

And for a long damn time, he
was bigger than everybody else

In our grade.

So he could say
whatever he wanted to,

And he didn't have to
worry, because nobody

Would dare touch him.

And then high school came along.

All of a sudden, JT started
looking up to a lot of people.

Needless to say, that
didn't go over too well.

I must've gotten his ass
out of a hundred flights.

What are you, his
Secret Service agent?

Doesn't that get to you?

Look, even if it
did... which I'm

Not saying it does...
Friends like JT

Don't come easy or often.

And the way I see it,
once they're your friends,

They're your friends
no matter what,

And you do whatever you have
to do to keep it that way.

Oh, thanks.

Oh, hey.

Oh, I'm so sorry, honey bear.

I'm just not all
that with it today.

See, once a year, I try to
donate as much blood as I can.

Today just happened
to be the special day.

Probably shouldn't be working,
but Kyle... that's our boss...

He's a real asshole.

Wouldn't give me the day off.

Well, what do you do?

Didn't Adia say something
about her boyfriend

Working at a hospital?


JT, come on.

We gotta go.

I'm not going anywhere.

Why the hell not?

JT: Because there's no
toilet paper in here.

Aw, shit.

None?

Not a shred.

Well, use something else.
Oh, yeah.

Good idea.

Why don't you toss your
shirt on over here, Alex?

Ah, shit.

I'm going to go get
him some toilet paper.

What's... you know,
what's the rush, anyway?

We think we figured out why
Slain's taking vamp blood.

All right, I'm listening.

Well, all right.

Adia mentioned that Slain
works in a hospital,

And hospitals have
blood banks, right?

Yeah, right.

For transfusions and car
accidents, yeah, right.

Right, right.

Well if Slain had access
to the blood bank,

He could use the vamp blood
he has in the cooler to taint

All of the hospital's
entire blood supply,

Thus making hundreds
of patients vamps.

But why type the bag so
carefully if he's just going

To taint the whole supply?

Well, because if you
mix the wrong vamp blood

With the wrong human
blood, it turns black,

And no doctors are
going to use that.

It's like putting a square
peg into a round hole.

So only for matching
the blood tit for fucking

Tat will the blood be
successfully tainted.

That's right.
Without being noticed?

Yeah.

JT: Well, how much
vampire blood does it

Take to taint human blood?

A lot or...
No, no, no.

One drop.

JT: A drop?

One drop.

One drop of vampire blood
gets into human blood,

Whoever gets that
blood isn't going

To be very human for very long.

Fuck.

But why would he want to turn
a bunch of people into vamps?

I mean, why would
anybody want to turn

Another person into a vampire?

I think he's in pain,
and he wants other people

To experience that pain.

Uh, I'm not following you.

What do you mean, here?

Well, it's like this
story I once heard.

OK?

There's this guy
who goes into a bar.

He gets a little too
drunk, he meets this girl,

He takes her home to have sex.

JT: OK.

Guy wakes up the next
morning, and she's gone.

He thinks nothing of it.

He goes to his
bathroom, and there

On the mirror,
written in lipstick

Is the phrase,
"Welcome to AIDS."

Jesus fucking Christ.

ALEX: I should have
saw this coming.

You know, all of us
vamps feel the same way

At one point or another.

Did you ever go through it?

Yeah.

When you've been in three wars,
and you lose entire platoons

Of guys younger than you,
that's when you start

Asking yourself things,
like why you survived,

And why couldn't they?

And is there anything you
could have done to help them?

When you bury your
little sister before you,

Let's just say that's not
the natural order of things.

That's when you start
focusing on the pain,

And you start blaming people.

JT: Blaming... wait a second.

Blaming... blaming
people for what?

For not being as
unlucky as you.

Well, look on the
bright side, Count.

At least you had
friends to bury.

They're all out
of toilet paper.

Oh, it'll do.

Go throw it over.

Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

Are you serious?

Paper towels?

You want me to wipe
my ass with this?

Why didn't you just go the whole
nine and bring back steel wool

Brillo pads.

do you feel, huh?

Like I've been anally
raped by a sandpaper dildo.

There are four
hospitals in this area.

We can't possibly check
them all in one night.

You sweeties left
this at your table.

Oh, thanks.

Four hospitals.

Christ.

What the... Guys, we don't
have to check all four.

Kern Hospital.

Daquindre.

Hey Slain.

How are you doing?

Hematology?

Hey, hey, hey!

You got authorization
to be here?

Where's Slain?

He's in the lab.

Oh, that was very cool of us.

Hey, are you... are you sure
you should just rush in there?


You mess with my friend,
you mess with... [grunts]




Thank you.

Alex.

Sure you got it all?

Yeah, I got it all.

Only the old bags were tainted.

What time is it?

A little after 1:30.

Well, I was thinking, you know,
it's a little late and all,

But if we get to
the theater in time,

We could still see
uh, Daryl Hannah crush

Harrison Ford in the crotch.

All right.

All right.
