[orchestral music playing]

I just wanna know one thing,
Frito.

Who was the guy
sitting next to Don Ding-dong?

It was his brother,
Don Twinkie-knee.

[Don Frito] He is a food chief
in another country.

[Mary Kay] You always win,
don't you Frito?

[Mary Kay] You always win.

It was between the brothers.

I had nothing to do with it.

[Mary Kay]
I'm going to leave you, Frito.

I'm going to take your children,
born and unborn.

[Don Frito]
You're not taking my children.

[Don Frito]
You're not taking my children!


[Don Frito coughs]

[Don Frito] Don't you know
I could never allow it?

That I would use
everything in my power

to keep that
from ever happening?

[Don Frito] I don't think you
blame me for your miscarriage.

For having sent you
to the fat farm to lose weight,

since I don't allow you to eat
anything other than junk food.

But I can change!

Mary Kay...

If history
has taught us anything,

everything can change!

You don't get it, do you?

It wasn't a miscarriage, Frito!

It was an abortion!

An attempt at abortion.

They were twin boys, Frito.

Two sons!

[Mary Kay] But I've taken them,

and I've hidden them
away from you someplace safe!

Someplace you'll never
find them!

Where are my boys?

[Don Frito] Where are my boys?

-[Mary Kay] No!
-[squish]

[trumpets playing]

-[fake plane noises]
-[Marilyn laughing]

[Kennedy laughs]

One of these days, Marilyn

this rocket will launch
a man to the moon!


Jack, can I touch your rocket?

-[Kennedy] Sure.
-[Marilyn swoons]

Launch me into orbit!

[door shuts]

Oh my god, it's Jackie!

we're both through!

-[Marilyn shrieks]
-[Kennedy] You have to go!


Anywhere! No, this way!

-[Marilyn] But, I thought--
-[Marilyn shouts]

-[glass shatters]
-[Marilyn screaming]

Jack!

I thought you were Jackie!

In the bedroom?

I'm so glad to see you!
Is everything okay?

Well, yes, I had twins!

Two boys!

I think they're boys.

Are they mine?

[Mary Kay laughs]
No, they're Don Frito's.

-[choir singing]
-[Kennedy] Thank god!

I mean... thank god they're his!


They are healthy, aren't they?

They have great hair!

[Mary Kay crying]

I just didn't know
where to turn to!

I just didn't know who to see!

-[Kennedy] Now, now.
-[Mary Kay] Sorry. I'm sorry.

[blowing nose]

[Mary Kay] Thank you.

I'm sorry!


the gorgeous women

whom I'm intimately
involved with

with their problems,
then what good am I?

Are you sure?

Sure, I'm sure!


There was this Vietnamese girl
I was seeing once.

She had a problem
with a fella back home.

I sent in the troops!

-[snap]
-It'll be over like that!

[Mary Kay giggles]

I just didn't want
little Angelo and little Michael

to be raised his way.

The Frito way.

So, I hid them and...

The next thing I know,

he told me
he was gonna murder me

if I didn't tell her
where those kids were!


They're with my grandparents,

[Mary Kay]
They helped with the delivery.

[Mary Kay breathing heavily]

[Mary Kay groaning]

Push!

Come on, Mary Kay! Push, push!

Come on, Mary Kay! Come on!

-[Miserio] Try a little harder!
-[Mary Kay screaming]



And a one, and a two...

-[Miserio] ...and a three!
-[Hilda] Three!

[fart noise]

-[bang]
-[baby grunts]

[Mary Kay sighs]



What a peeshadel!

It's a beautiful peeshadel!

[Al Dente gasps] Whoa, wait!

Wait a minucce!


Or maybe it's an ass?
I no can tell!

[Mary Kay screaming]

-[whoosh]
-[fart noise]

-[bang]
-[baby grunts]

-[baby groaning]
-[Mary Kay shouts]

[lullaby playing]

I didn't know your grandparents
were still alive.

Somewhat.

My grandfather, he's great.
His name's Miserio.

He came from the old country.

-[splashing]
-[Miserio groaning]


of this country.

[Mary Kay] He was a politician,
too, you know?

[Mary Kay]
He was a great speaker.

-[splash]
-[Miserio gasps]

Hey...

The United States of Antarctica!

The land of opportunity!

Ask not what your country
can do for you,

but ask what you can do
for yourself!

-[applause]
-[Miserio] Capisce?

Not bad!

That's not bad at all!

Listen. Here's what
I want you to do.

Michael and Angelo...

They're safe
with your grandparents, right?

-[Mary Kay] Yes.
-[Kennedy] Leave them there.

I'm going to send you away
for a little while.

There's this lovely
little island paradise

off the coast of Florida.

It's called Cuba.

You'll love it there.

I'll take care of Don Frito.

[Mary Kay] Jack, I am scared!

[Mary Kay]
Frito's a dangerous man!

[Mary Kay] What if he finds me?

[Mary Kay] What if he hurts you?

[Kennedy laughs]

Mary Kay, what could possibly
happen to me?

I'm the president!


[dramatic music playing]

[music crescendo]




[dramatic music continues]

[car horn]


Jeez, it's hot out here!

like an orangutan!


Ang, somebody's coming!

-[Michael] Assume the position!
-[Angelo] Okay!


Redwood Stump.


-[Michael] You look just like!
-[Angelo] The resemblance!

-[Michael] It's amazing!
-[Angelo] Uncanny!

[Michael and Angelo]
The Riddler!

[Michael and Angelo laughing]

-[dramatic music playing]
-[chicken snickering]

coming along soon.

Yeah, I'm sure it will,

but, listen, until it gets here,

you don't mind if we tell you
a bit about ourselves, do ya?


Yeah, the Misery brothers!


you gotta understand
about our family.

It always starts with family.

The heads of
the other junk food families,

Don Dorito, Don Cheeto,
Don Pretzel,

are very angry
about our cutting prices!

There will be slashing
and bloodshed

in the marketplace
in retaliation!

And there's even rumors

of an all-out war
between the families!

Maybe federal intervention!

You've got to make some small
token concession!

A billion-dollar donation
to the FDA

would buy us some valuable time!

[chair creaking]

You come to my home...

...on the day
I am to be reunited

with my forever lost sons.

And you ask me to commit
the ultimate sin.

Voluntary giving money
to the federal government!

What's the matter with you?
Are you...?

Am I what?

[Don Frito] I can't remember the
last time you came to my house

for a cup of coffee!

You don't drink coffee!

friend, Fairy Godfather?

[Don Frito groans]

Keep going.

Up the arm!

[Don Frito moaning]

The bulging biceps!

All the way!

[Don Frito moans]

[Don Frito] Finally, I can drop
the manly mumble voice,

this masquerade
I've been leading!

I can come out of the cupboard
and say,

"I want to be me!"

-[Don Frito] I want to be me!
-[advisor wailing]

[Don Frito weeping]


It's nothing personal!

Strictly business!

[Don Frito clapping]

[gears turning]

I drink a little more
than I used to.

[playful music playing]


[Don Frito gulping]

[Don Frito sighs]

[Don Frito] Ah!

[Don Frito burps]

[gulping continues]

[Don Frito burps]

[cuckoo clock cooing]

[gulping continues]

[Don Frito burps]

[playful music continues]




It seems that our associates
have finally had some luck

in finding your sons.

You mean I'll finally have heirs
to the Frito fortune?

Someone to rely on?

To manage my affairs?

Someone that can carry on
the Frito way?

Family tradition?

No... but you do have two sons.

Tell me! What are they like?

Handsome?

Powerful?

Masculine men?

The type that can walk
into a room

and everyone notices them?

The type of men that,

when you meet them,
you can never forget them?

Are my boys like that?


They... certainly
make an impression.

[Love mumbling]

You can't really beat this.

[Love sighs]

Well, my work is done here!

[door opens]



I'm going in first.

I've gotta prepare him
for the experience

of meeting ya'll
for the first time.


a very emotionally trying
experience for him.

Not to mention, this man's
got a bad heart!

No problem!

We won't mention his bad heart!

Our lips are sealed!



My name is Luke.

Luke!

Luke!

I can't tell you how long
I've waited for this moment!

How much meeting you
means to me!

-[Luke] You what?
-[Don Frito] No, no, no!

Please don't speak!
Don't ever speak!

Where was I? What was I saying?

You were saying,

[Luke mimicking Don Frito]
"How I can't wait

to meet this moment!
How--you. How much!"

[Don Frito]
"Meeting you means to me."

I know where I am now.
Thank you.

Luke...

Search your heart!

Look deep inside!

I'm your father, Luke!

[Don Frito]
You know it to be true!

[Don Frito] You don't know
the power of the dark side!

[Don Frito] Channel your anger!

[Don Frito] Let it consume you

with rage against
the federal government!

[inspirational music playing]

[Don Frito]
And together, as father and son,

we will rule the food universe!

It's your destiny, my son!

Say what?

No, no, no!
I'm not your son, man!

What?

I'm Luke Stairclimber!

Who?

I'm Luke Stairclimber!

[Don Frito] Oh...

I'm the detective
hired by Haagendas

to find your sons!

Oh...


These are your sons!

[dramatic music plays]


[Don Frito groans]

Daddy!

[Don Frito groans loudly]

[groaning intensifies]

[Angelo and Michael groaning]



and last time we met our father.

Just as we were getting
to know him!

He was gone with the wind!

But even though we only knew him
for a brief moment,

there was a convulsion!

Something was there between us!

You could just feel it!

-[Michael] A bondage thing!
-[Angelo] Yeah!

-[Redwood grumbling]
-[Michael] Anyway...

That one meeting... would change
the course of our lives!

-[Michael] Forever.
-[Angelo] Forever.


at Daddy's funeral.

-[upbeat music playing]
-[clapping]


[choir singing]

[singing intensifies]

[loud applause]

-[screaming]
-[whistling]


Thank you, Precious Hearts!

[choir cheers]

Can I get an "amen"?




I said, praise the lord!


-[Scheister] Hallelujah!
-[crowd] Hallelujah!

Glory, glory! Hallelujah!


Walk a dog!




Yeah!

And that's the reason
we are here today!


Quiet!

I wanna hear a pin drop!


[Scheister laughing] Now...

As I was attempting to say,


to show our disrespect!

Our final disrespect!


To a man, known to us all...

...as Jeffrey Dahmer.

We're at the wrong funeral!

[Scheister mumbling]

[Scheister laughs] No, no, no.

As, uh...

Don Frito Layleone!

[crowd jeers]



was a great and filthy rich man!

[crowd cheering]

Yes, he was!

He gave freely
of his colossal wealth

to all those causes

in which he truly believed
he could buy!

he died before his mission,

our mission, was complete!

And now, due to certain
accounting errors...

working for him?

Second Son of Mary

needs seven million dollars...


it's divine doors open!

The church needs this money!

I need this money!


Just last night,

the lord almighty, himself,

in his infinite voice,

spoke to me!

[crowd cheers]

Saying, "Scheister!"


"Scheister!"


"If you don't get that money

by noon, next Sunday,

I will strike you dead!"


[Scheister grumbling]

[Scheister shouts]

His hair looks like Don King!

One, two, three, four!

[choir singing]

-[Michael sobbing]

-[bam]
-[Michael] Whoa!

[audience clapping]

[car brakes screech]

[loud car horn]


The reason I called
you all here today

Is for the reading
of Don Frito Layleone's

last will and testament.

Old Testament or New Testament?


Let's hear what he has to say.


[Don Frito] I hereby confess
to the murders of--


[tape player squeaking]

[Don Frito]
I, Don Frito Layleone,

being of somewhat sound mind
and out-of-shape body,

do hereby bequeath
my entire junk food empire

to my only know living heirs.

[Don Frito] My two sons,
Michael and Angelo.

-[Michael] No way!
-[Angelo] Way!

[Don Frito] However,
there are two conditions.

[Don Frito] One...

[Don Frito] The two of you
cannot be convicted of a felony

for a period of one year.

[Don Frito] Two...

[Don Frito] You both
must be married within one year

in order to intend
to bear children

and carry on the family name.

[Don Frito] In the event either
of these conditions are not met,

my entire estate
will then be bequeathed

to the Second Son
of Mary Church.


[Scheister laughing]

[Don Frito] Amen.

[laughing continues]



we've only had each other.


our dignity,
our self-worthlessness.

200 million dollars!

[Michael and Angelo laugh]

we'll change, do ya Mike?

You can take a Misery
out of the sewer,

but you can never
get rid of the stench.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

You don't think Daddy
would be upset with us

for knocking over his casket
and getting run over by a truck,

do you?

No, these things happen
from time to time.

I know, but I still feel guilty,

him having to be cremated
and all.

I'm sure he wanted to be buried
here at Frito Lawn

with the rest
of his dead family.

Ang, put yourself in his shoes.

Okay.

If your body was mangled,

your head decapitated

massive chunks
of your face missing,

because they were ground up
by a truck axel.

Would you want to be put
in the ground looking like that?

Next to people who know you?

Yeah, I guess you're right.

It's better this way!

Look, he'll be happier here,
amongst his family!

People who know him and love him
for what he's done for us!

Yeah...

somewhere nice to put him.


Operation Date-Bait
is ready to ramble.

Here's the plan.

The girls come over,

and our two bozos will think
they're doing good with them.

The girls have been instructed

to compliment them
at every opportunity

and laugh at
all of their jokes.

Soon, after a little dancing,
a little dinner,

a little hanky-panky,

and then, they dial 911-RAPE.

Hasta la vista,
Misery brothers!

Hola, dinero.

[Scheister laughing]

You sure this will work?

Listen, if you were on a jury,

would you honestly believe
that two beautiful women

would actually willingly
have sex with these two?

[Scheister laughs]

I get your point.

I can't believe Tom Haagendas

offered to help us find wives.

I think we have a real friend!

[jazz playing]

Hey, Ang! You look good!

You, too, Mike!

If I was a girl, like your
sister, instead of your brother,

I would date you.

Thanks, Ang.

Sure, Mike.

Just remember!

These girls aren't like
what we dated in the past!

They've got, uh...

... declassee!

Okay.

Now, let's go over the "don'ts"
one last time.

Don't cop a feel,

never spit without a spittoon,

don't adjust the family jewels,

-[Angelo] except now,
-[squeaking]

and, um...

Oh... don't tell no tall tales!

Exactly!

Just don't be ourselves
and everything should go smooth!

Like butter on a melon!

-[knocking]
-[girls] Knock, knock!




"Bambie and Fauna" who?

[Bambie and Fauna] Your dates!

-[wind blowing]
-[slam]

[trumpets playing]


Your high-beams are on.

We took a cab.

[Bambie gasps]

[Angelo sighs]


[slow music playing]

[Barbie and Fauna] Ooh!

[Barbie giggles]


[Barbie and Fauna laughing]







[Barbie and Fauna laugh]

[Barbie and Fauna] Wow!

-[slam]
-[Quazzie] I hope you enjoy it!

-[Michael] Thanks, Quaz!
-[Angelo] Thanks!

Nothing like
fine wine and cheese!



[Barbie and Fauna giggling]

-[plop]
-[clanging]

I wanna propose a toast!


my brother and I
were merely actors.

Master thespians, performing
on the cruel stage we call life.

the timely death of our father--


To who we are forever grateful--


-[Michael] A toast to Daddy.
-[Barbie and Fauna giggling]

L'chaim!

Szechuan!

Today, the chef has prepared
some real good food!

What is it?

I got no freaking clue!
I just serve it!

-[Quazzie] Bon appetite!
-[crash]

[Barbie and Fauna chuckling]

know Tom Haagendas?

I used to do his brother.

And I used to do his sister.

That's real nice! Keeping it
in the family and all!

How about you two?

Oh, we're
strictly heterosapiens.

Strictly.


Today, we have
a real dessert treat!


Torched Alaska!


[fire blazing]


chowing down our luncheon.

It's been very, very good!


you all liked it!

Did you ever find out
what it was?

Oh, yeah! The chef said
it was black stallion!

[Barbie and Fauna] What?

Horse meat!


a horse recently or nothing!

You see, there was this horse.


They cut his head off years ago

for some gangster movie.

to waste the body!

[Barbie and Fauna heaving]

Him being a thoroughbred
prize-horse,

they just tossed it
into the meat locker

with the other stiffs!



to throw up on that!


[Barbie and Fauna crying]

They both have weak stomachs!


[Fauna and Angelo laugh]


[Fauna making plane noises]



The jets aren't very strong.





[Michael laughs]

[Barbie and Fauna chuckle]

I love bubble baths!

It makes me feel so... bubbly!

[Michael giggles]

I love when the bubbles
go up your rear end!


My little friend's
getting very happy!


Can I say hello
to your little friend?

Can I say hello
to your little friend?

You want to say hello
to Mr. Python?

Oh, yes!

You want to say hello
to King Cobra?

Yes!

-[snakes hissing]
-[Fauna shrieking]

-[Michael yelling]
-[Barbie shrieking]

You're gonna scare the snakes!

you made me go in my pants!

[Barbie and Fauna screaming]

Girls, listen!

sorry!

to spook you or nothing!

a Jumbo Frito candy bar!

-[Michael] See!
-[Barbie and Fauna whining]

Can you just get us a blanket,

or a towel or something?

Yeah, before we freeze to death!


[breathing heavily]


Look, it's electric!


[Barbie and Fauna shrieking]

[zapping intensifies]

I heard the girls almost died.

still on life support,

but the doctor said
they should pull through.

[Scheister chuckles]

I'll say a prayer... for you.

So, I may have underestimated
the enemy! Big deal!

Hitler underestimated
the Russian winter,

but he didn't
freeze to death, did he?

I'll give you one last chance!

Well, that's all the chances
that I'll need.


[door creaks]


-[click]
-[Dolly] Strip-to-Kill.

[whip cracking]


or it's gonna be you!


I wonder if it's a Michelangelo.

[Michael and Angelo laugh]





my real name?


Psychic, huh?

and Angelo Misery Layleone.


[Michael and Angelo] Intimately!

You're sexual preference
is none of my business!

Live and let die!
You know what I mean?

I don't think you understand.

You calling me stupid?

No!

Oh, my whole gold-digging life!

Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!

That's all I ever heard!

And I'm sick of it!

Can I help it if I was blessed
with the money to buy these?

-[swishing]
-[Dolly] Well, can I help it?

My brother and I are thrilled

that you had the money
to buy your bazookas!


[Dolly laughs] Wait a minute!

Did you say... brothers?

As in the Misery brothers?

Michael.

And Angelo.

[Michael and Angelo]
At your service!

[Dolly chuckles]



[Dolly laughing]
You're so silly!


Your surprise welcome home

She forgot her boombox!



Hey, you forgot your boombox.


[jazz playing]

[Dolly whining]

[Dolly screaming]


[phone ringing]


I know what you're gonna say,
but I swear it wasn't my fault!

Everything was going great!

She danced...
got down and naked!

She just had no focus!
Her tits were too big!

It was like, "slam,
bang, kaboom"!

The whole thing lasted
less than five minutes!

Now that it's over, she'll never
dance for a man again!

[Mrs. Haagendas]
Tom, it's your wife!

[Mrs. Haagendas]
I was calling to ask

if you wanted macaroni
or casserole for dinner,

but it sounds like you've
already had dessert!

-[Mrs. Haagendas] I'm slaving--
-[click]

[phone ringing]



Hey, I heard what happened.

You already talked to my wife?


These brothers,
they're real pros!

Bad boys in a good hood!

But bad ain't never
messed with worse!

And good ain't never
tangled with supreme!

You hear what I'm saying? Huh?

[Scheister cackling]

[Michael and Angelo snoring]

[dramatic music playing]

[Michael and Angelo gasp]

[Michael and Angelo shriek]

[playful music playing]


[Michael and Angelo]
Morning, Quazzie.

Did you guys sleep well?

Just like two crying babies.

Hey Quazzie,
can I ask you a question?

Sure, as long as
it's not hard or nothing.

What did Daddy do for fun?

I mean, all of this
is great and everything,

but I'm starting to feel...
constipated.


Very congested!

Ever since we've been bestowed
with all this fame and fortune,

I feel like a celebrity
or something!

I feel like Madonna!

Hey, why don't you guys
get away for a few hours?

There's a limo! Take it!
Go shopping or something!

comfortable driving no limo.

Yeah, and they're so hard
to park.

Ain't that the truth?

Suit yourselves!

[playful music continues]


Hey, Mike! Look over there!

That, my brother, is a slice
of pure Americana!

-[Angelo] Tijuana, anyway.
-[Michael laughs]


[buzzing continues]

What a piece of hardware!

You must be very proud!

Si, seÃ±or!

This is the best leaf-blower
I've ever had!

I bought it at Sears,
where America shops!

We're talking about the car!

-[crash]
-[man in hat] Oh... si, seÃ±or!

This is the best car
I've ever had!

What kind of car is it?

[upbeat music playing]

â™ª It's an automatic â™ª

â™ª Systematic â™ª

â™ª Cruise control-omatic â™ª

â™ª '67 Chevy â™ª

[Michael and Angelo] A what?

[man in hat singing]

[Michael and Angelo] So, can we
borrow the car, or what?

[man in hat singing]
â™ª '67 Chevy, '67 Chevy â™ª

â™ª We're cruising
Down the street â™ª

â™ª '67 Chevy, '67 Chevy â™ª

I just realized something!

Look at the four legs on them!

Look at the breasts!

[girl in yellow]
Shouldn't somebody help him?

[girl in blue] He could be hurt!

[girl in blue]
He landed pretty hard!

Well, even though
his own situation

was caused completely
by his own bad driving...


...we would offer to help him!

Except for one reason.

What's that?

Liability.

and pull him out,

and his head
would become severed...


He dials 1-900-REVENGE!

And then, it's
"hello, aimless chases",

"goodbye, 200 million dollars"!

Excuse me, did I
just hear you correctly?

"Hello, aimless chases"?

No, I think she means
the second part.

Oh, "goodbye, 200 million"?

[both girls at once] Yes!

â™ª 200 million, 200 million â™ª

â™ª We're cruising

[Angelo groaning]

Come on, Mike!


[girls growling]

Money, money!





-[Angelo] It's called a bribe!
-[Roddy] Money!

[Roddy laughing]

That's why, you know...
I love this job!

[Roddy chuckles]

Look, it's Brad Pitt!

-[girl] Where? Where is he?
-[Roddy] Right over there!

[Angelo whispering]
He ain't really there!


-[grinding]
-[whack]

-[girl grunts]
-[slam]

-[cheering]
-[Roddy] Yeah!


[Michael chuckles]

I have an idea!

-[bagpipes playing]
-[Roddy] So...

I can do for you gentlemen,

like your lawn,
your girlfriends,

your hair? Why don't you get
a new barber, huh?


[Roddy laughs]

but I'll teach ya
how to blow my horn--


-[Roddy cackles]
-[slam]

[bagpipes playing]



-[boing]
-[Michael and Angelo groaning]

-[bam]
-[Michael and Angelo] Oh!


like it was only last week!

[respirator beeping]

It was only last week, Ang.

But from there,

after what had been
the best time of our lives...

everything was about
to turn to shit!

[Michael mumbling] Don't worry,
I'll get her! I'll take her out!


-[Michael] Huh?
-[Al] Up and at 'em!

[Michael grumbling]

[Michael and Angelo shout]


-[Al] Oh! I'm so embarrassed!
-[Michael] Ooh!

Mom would kill me if she knew

I still carried
this picture of her!

you know?




My name is Lieutenant Al Dente.



That's my twin brother, Angelo.

Nice to meet ya!






You're absolutely positive?

I took the samples, myself!

There's no question whatsoever!
It's a definite match!

Alright, toss it into evidence,
and be careful!


for a trial.

That is,
if these two pizza koombas

survive long enough in prison
to even make it to court!


I don't go down for nobody!

-[smacking]
-[Al] Take it easy, Frank!


Al, you know what I found?


of Neverlast boxing gloves

over these two female
corpus delicti!

Toss it into the evidence!


-[Al] Gentlemen...
-[crash]



-[Debbie] Says who?
-[Jane] Says me.

-[Debbie] Says you?
-[Jane] Oh, yeah!

-[Debbie] I didn't think so.
-[Jane] I think so.

-[Jane] Uh-huh.
-[Debbie laughs]

Hi!

Welcome to Trash MTV!

This is Debbie Saville.

And I'm Jane Plymouth.

Michael and Angelo
Misery Layleone

have been indicted
on the brutal double murder

of two gold-digging prostitutes

who worked reputedly
for the Midnight Madam.

-They're current--
-[slam]

Currently being held

at Maximum Security
Federal Butman Prison...


torturous and inhumane treatment

that has become synonymous
with Butman--


They will be brought to trail
first thing in the morning,

in what promises to be
the real media circus.

[whips cracking]

[Jane and Debbie grumbling]

[Scheister laughs]

It'll be a circus, alright!
And they're the clowns!

[Scheister laughing]

-[Al] Come on, let's go!
-[warden] Come here!

-[warden] Get over there!
-[Al] Get over there!

-[warden] Stand back!
-[Al] Get moving!


[prisoner yelling]


what do you want to do
with these guys?

-[Al] The executive suite?
-[warden] No.



anybody really cares!

[warden and Al chuckle]




[baby whines]


They all crack.


[warden and Al laughing]

[baby whining]

[door rattling]

-[yelling]
-[spitting]

Hey, knock it off, you two!



You don't mean in there?

This guy looks hungrier
than Jeffrey Dahmer!


A cannibal looking for dessert!

No... You two?

I've got something
really special for you!


[warden and Al] The dryer!

[warden and Al laughing]

[Michael and Angelo] The dryer?


This place isn't so bad.

Yeah, the rent's free.


You two boys ready to confess?

You a priest?

Part-time.

-[pop]
-[creak]

Oh, I don't feel so good...

kind of blue...

You got the blues?

[jazz playing]



[warden singing]

[baby whining]

[baby snorts]

[intense guitar playing]

[baby laughing]

Thank you very much!

Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen!

Welcome! This is the main event
of the evening!

Twelve rounds of litigation

for the undisputed life or death
of the defendants,

the Misery brothers!

And, fighting
out of the defense corner,

representing
the Public Defenders Office

with a horrendous record
of zero wins,

thirty-seven defeats,
and one hung jury,

although several jurors
did survive!

of Pig Bay, Cuba!

The one and only Ima Barrister!



of the prosecution corner,

this distinguished professional
has amassed an amazing record

of 74 victories!

Sixty by gas chamber,
ten by torture,

and one be lethal elocution!

I give you the one, the only,
the incomparable,


-[applause]
-[trumpets playing]

Presiding over the action,

this former restaurateur
turned judge

has presided over
some of the most infamous

and botched mistrials
in history!

[gong rings]

that I give you

the ever popular,
crowd-pleasing people's judge!

Judge Ben E. Hama!

[crowd cheering]

[Ben shouts]

-[clanging]
-[Ben] Yaruzo!

[Ben shouts]

-[banging]
-[slicing]

House lights!


Alright. Bailiffs,
bring in the defendants!


Ow, my dick!

[suspenseful music playing]

[Michael and Angelo mumbling]

The Misery brothers.

There's an argument
for birth control!

[mumbling continues]

please approach the bench?

[romantic music playing]

-[snap]
-[Weakly] Ben?

[Ben coughs]

Yes, um...

-[slice]
-[Ben] Now...

I want a good, clean trial.

No hitting below the belt.

No book deals.

No posturing in the press.

-[bang]
-This trial will be conducted

in this courtroom!

-[wobble]
-Not under the media!

of these very simple rules,

and I will hold you in contempt.

Sanction you.

I'll have you maimed
and disbarred!

Now, am I very clear
on this matter?

Oh yes, your honor!

Crystal.

Very well.

[romantic music continues]


[Ben laughing]

-[bonk]
-[Weakly] Oh!



Would you please rescind
the gag order

so brutally imposed
on my clients?

Uh...

Mr. Weakly, do you
have any objections?

Nah!

What do they got to say?

Uh... sure. As long as
they don't talk too much.

Oh, I promise!

Thank you.

You are so sweet!



Where's our regular attorney?

Yeah, where's Tom Haagendas?

Oh, he's not coming.

[Michael and Angelo] What?

Maybe this will help.


-[whip cracking]
-[Ima moaning]



My husband and I are trying
to work something out.



[Don Frito] Under the post-human
revisions of my latest will,

your inheritance
and everyone that comes with it

are hereby frozen...

[Michael and Angelo] Frozen?

[Don Frito] ...pending the
outcome of this trial.



a moment alone, please?



What do you think, Mike?

The things
I'd like to do to her...


Oh!

Well, we could
call our cousin, Vinny,

but I hear he's doing a sequel.


Ang.

Miss Barrister?




And is it easy to get credit?



as a service by the state!




[Ben yells]


Are we about ready
for opening statements?

Persecution ready, your honor!



Now, in order to speed things up

and execute people,

I have taken the liberty
to personally interview and...

[Ben coughs] ...select the jury.

Your honor,
with all due circumspect,

the process of voir dire,
or jury erection,

is semi-guaranteed

under the munificently
inadequate constituency

of this great state!

I feel it would be tragic...

-[Ben shouts]
-[slam]


...if I were to continue.

I get your point.

Great.

Well... now it's time
to bring in the jury!

[Ben laughs]

[American anthem plays]

Oh, that's some jury pool!


Court reporter, if you please!

[court reporter chewing]

[court reporter grunts]



Ladies and gentle-bosoms
of the jury!

Let's keep abreast of the facts!

We put up a strong front!

You can't be a hung jury!

It's not a matter
of tit for tat!

You're here today to see
that justice is served!

That these two bloody-rare
murderers are cooked!

Well done.

These two miserable excuses
for human beings

brutally killed two
of the best pieces of ass

that money can buy!

I know!



In the trenches!
Between the sheets!

Mono to mono!

-[Weakly] Call girl...
-[stomp]

...to marine!

Our evidence is irresponsible
and concealing!

We have matching gloves,
fingerprints,

perpetrators obscene
at the scene of the crime!


to the state of our union,

FNA evidence so complex...

that I promise you,
you will have no idea

what the hell it is!

So, I explore you!

Make your goal line stand!

Act like real men!

Win one for the unkind!

Win one... for the Gipa!

Okay.


Miss Barrister?

Present!

No, no, sweetheart.

[Ben chuckles]

Your opening statement.

[paper crinkling]

[romantic music playing


This case is really
a lot easier than I look!

You have two
allegedly dead women...

Two allegedly alive suspects...

What does it all mean?

Have aliens visited us?

Is there life after death?


isn't brutally murdering
somebody,

really just giving them
a new life?

-[slam]
-[Weakly] Objection, your honor!

thought on the part of the jury!


Miss Barrister...

You will refrain from using
any statements or questions

that require thought.

Yes, my lord.


Mr. Weakly states my clients
should be deep fried!

Hmm? Well... look at these two!

[all jurors] Aww!


Look at how pitiful they are!

-[squeaking]
-[Ima] How pathetic!

Now, I ask you...

Who are the real victims
in this crime?

Is Elvis alive?

And do these guys
deserve to die?

Just because they're...
worthless losers?

I don't think so.



Mr. Weakly,
call your first witness, please.

-[slam]
-[click]


Hello, Al? It's F. Me.

F. Me!

No, "F" you, Al! It's F. Me!

Right!

Listen! I need you
to come down and testify!

Okay!

I saw a bacteria cell
on the chrome bumper of the car!

Realizing the occupants
of the estate

were in a potentially
life-threatening situation,

my partner, Detective Frank,
and I, decided to act!


of this estate

appear to be in a potentially
life-threatening situation!

you're absolutely, positively,

100 percent correct, Al!

Let me ask you something!


or should I jump the fence
and grab the ledge percolator?

I don't think so, Frank!

My sentiments, exactly!

[tires grinding]


[sirens blaring]

And the rest is history!

Michael and Angelo,
after we roughed them up,

basically confessed,

and Lieutenant Frank
found the gloves!

That's it.

-[slam]
-[Ima] Lieutenant Dente!




Did you plant the gloves?

[Al breathing heavily]


No further questions.

just like we rehearsed.


[Frank coughs]
I heard the "ding-ding".


the gloves...
They were on my hands.


They was a perfect... match?

Match!

-[Weakly] Great.
-[Ima] Objection, your honor!

Yes, Miss Barrister?

The witness is reading
from a teleprompter.

-[slam]
-[Ben] Sidebar!

[Michael and Angelo] Sidebar?

[gong rings]

Banzai!

-[Weakly] Banzai!
-[Ima] Banzai!



Your honor, what do you think
about the teleprompter issue?

The witness reads very badly.


Please continue.

As I was saying...

Well, I heard the "ding-ding"
in the "boom-bing"...

Something like that!

But the next thing I know,
the gloves was in my hands!

And they were a perfect match!


Yes, Ima?

The witness is being coached.

-[slam]
-[Ben] Sidebar!

I sure am thirsty!

[gong rings]

Mazel tov!




[Ima sighs]

My lord, what do you think
about the coaching issue?

[Ben slurring]
Coach coaches very badly!

I, Euretha San Diago,
so solemnly swear

the whole truth, and nothing
but the whole damn truth,

or may the big man upstairs
smack my ass down!

Okay!


-[Euretha] San Diago!
-[Weakly] Of course!

Eureka, what is
your current preoccupation?

[Euretha coughs]

I am a domestic servient

at the estate of the diseased
Don Frijole Leone.

I didn't know we had a maid!

we could eat off the floor!

...committed the gruesome
double murders

of our dearly beloved!

I object!

Yeah, me too!


Shallow.

That's very deep, Mike.

-[Ben groaning]
-[knives clanging]

-[Ben shouts]
-[bang]

You may continue, Mr. Weakly.


As I was saying before
I was so rudely interpreted...

Tell us everything you saw,
or didn't see,

on the night in question.

-[slam]
-[Euretha] Look...

Like I said before,
I didn't see nothing!

I don't know nothing!

You don't know nothing?

[joyous music playing]

[Euretha singing]

â™ª She don't know nothing â™ª

â™ª There ain't nothing
That she's seen â™ª

â™ª She don't know nothing â™ª

â™ª She's just a maid
Doing her job â™ª

â™ª These two guys
Are really big slobs â™ª

â™ª She don't know nothing â™ª

â™ª Nothing, nothing at all â™ª

â™ª She got her a job
Working nine to five â™ª

â™ª She's telling you the truth
And that's no jive â™ª

â™ª Clock strikes five
And she don't get paid â™ª

â™ª She don't lie around
Hanging in the shade â™ª

â™ª She don't know nothing â™ª

â™ª Nothing, nothing at all â™ª

[trumpet playing]

[harmonica playing]

â™ª Nothing, nothing â™ª

â™ª Nothing, nothing â™ª

â™ª Nothing, nothing â™ª

[Ben laughs]

-[slam]
-[Ben] Dismissed!

As I was saying...

I eat breakfast every morning
at a donut stand

Two hundred yards
from the enemy.

Ain't that the guy
that rear-ended us?

The tailgater!


You applaud Santiago,
yet you despise me

for the very comforts
I afford you.

Did you order Detective Mancini
and Lieutenant Al Dente

to plant the black gloves?

I specifically ordered the men
to not touch Miss Santiago.

[Ima sighs]

Did you order Detective Mancini
and Lieutenant Al Dente

to plant the black gloves?

-[slam]
-[Ima] I want the truth!


The truth?

You can't handle the truth!

Listen, bimbo...

We live in a world with walls!

Big walls!

And sometimes, officers
have to crash through them!

It's their job!

Did you order a code glove?

No... I did not.

Okay.


We got problems.

Big problems.

The state calls FNA expert,

wilderness scientist,
Newton Gingrich Einstein!

[suspenseful music playing]


Mr. Einstein,
in someone else's words,

please tell us
exactly what FNA is.

Fart Naturally Anally.

It's a 99.9 percent way
of misidentifying someone

through the genetic fingerprints
that each of us leave.

Everyone's farts
have a unique appearance

and personality!

-[slam]
-[Weakly] Exactly!

Now, I'm gonna have
our lovely exhibit model

bring over that vile vial
for your examination.

-[Michael] Dirty rat!
-[Angelo sighs]

[door opens and shuts]



Can you scientifically identify
the fart in question?

I think I can do that.



[lips smacking]

-[coughing]
-[heaving]

[Einstein coughs]

Okay!

Now that you've had a chance
to incompletely recover,

can you identify
the type of fart,

as well as the perpetrators
of the fart?

The fart in question
is of your classic

sugar-coated
"breakfastas cerealus" cereal.

Or, specifically,
Story Book Cereal.

And it was caused by...

...them!

[Michael sighs]

-[booing]
-[Weakly] Thank you.

your honor.

Very good!

Excellent case!

Miss Barrister?

Yes?


you would like to present
to the court, sweetheart?

-[romantic music playing]
-[Ima] Yeah, um...



[Angelo breathing heavily]


-[Michael] What?
-[Angelo] Mike!


-[Angelo] Over there!
-[fart]



Miss Barrister, come here!

[Michael whispering] Come on!

[quiet grumbling]


[Ima, Michael and Angelo]
Ooh... break!

Your honor...

The defense calls
the court reporter to the stand

as an excellent
expert FNA witness.

Rejection, your honor!

What possible credentials
could she have

for such an odious and
intellectually exhausting

area of expertise?


She's acceptable.



Oh, no! You can call me Susie!

-[Ima] Susie...
-[Susie] Yeah?

about the prosecution's case?

You think it can hold water?


[Ima and Susie chuckle]

you could tell us

what you were just eating?


It's my favorite cereal!

But it does give me
just a little...


...gas.

[Susie laughs] Excuse me.

you've heard here today,

can you tell the court
what is the relevance of that?

Well...

Everybody knows
that Story Book Cereal

has a 92 percent sugar content!

factor of 3.75,

when multiplied
by the exponential root

of the Pythagorean theory
of relativity,

can only mean one thing!

What?

That the FNA sample in question

could not possibly have come
from Story Book Cereal!

an odor of this magnitude

from one fiber source,
and one fiber source only!



That is, of course, a burrito.

[Susie chuckles]



during the deposition

of Michael and Angelo
Misery Layleone,

what did they state
they had for breakfast?

Could it have been
the incriminating burrito?

[music crescendo]




What was it then?
What could it have been?

[triumphant music playing]

Story Book Cereal!

[jurors at once] Ahh!

No further questions.

The defense rests.

-[lullaby playing]
-[snoring]


And now, ladies and gentlemen...

Here is your decision!

score the bout exactly the same!

by unanimous decision!

champion of the world,

Ima Barrister!

[loud applause]

[Ben laughing]

[knives clanging]

[Ben grunts]

[laughing continues]

Justice is served! Yes!

-[shouting]
-[clapping]

That was some moment, Ang!

When we heard the proclamation
of our emancipation...

[Michael giggling]

-[Angelo] Oh, yeah!
-[Michael] That was something!

we were free to go!

-[Michael laughing]
-[Angelo] It touched me!


[car engine running]

[door opens]


-[whoosh]
-[crash]

[door shuts]


I'm Doctor Joyce Brothers!

-[Angelo] Hey.
-[Joyce] Hi!

get here earlier, doc.

The guy they just took away?

He really could have used you!

that kind of a doctor!

I'm a psychologist!

I listen to people tell--


I guess you could say that, yes.

Doc, did you come
to the right place!

She sure did!



-[gulp]
-[burp]

[ending music playing]
