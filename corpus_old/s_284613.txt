Uncle Chan, your football
skill is very good!

How about we have a
competition with them today?

Good!

Let's go.

I don't have a football,
why are you stopping?

Uncle, pass the ball!

Great, it's got in!

Great!

Uncle Chan, that pass was really good!

Right, I have to go to work.

I'll play with you
again tomorrow, goodbye.

Very good! Very good...

Fai, give Grandpa
medicine when you're back.

I know, Mum.

My Mum is calling me.
I have to go, goodbye!

Mum, do you know?

I'm especially good today.

Grandpa, do you know I'm
especially good today?

I kept passing the players
and finally came to the goal.

It's a big kick into
the goal, yeah! I got it!

I can see it.

Fai, did you give medicine to Grandpa?

I know.

Mum, do you know the reason why

I feel specially good when
playing football with Uncle Chan.

Mum, is Beckham cool?

Am I looked like Beckham?

Like who?

Beckham.

The guy we saw together
from the video last time.

The guy whom I've pointed to you.

I do recall him.

Is it the one that is skinny with bald?

Skinny and bald.

That is my idol!

How can you describe him in such a way?

Grandpa, you should know who is Beckham?

No way,

women don't understand these things.

Mum, do you think

I'll become a football star in future?

Maybe.

You don't even have a
little confidence in me.

Grandpa,

you should believe that I can
be a football star in the future.

Grandpa knows me well.

Yes, Grandpa is great.

Mum is no good, right?

I never say that.

Fai, Mum has to go
to hand in the script.

Fai, I've put the lunch
in the rice-cooker.

You need to heat it before
giving it to Grandpa to eat.

You can read him some news afterwards.

And remember to massage
the finger for Grandpa too.

I understand.

Right, also...

Don't run around and
don't play computer games.

You don't have to worry me. Pay
attention to yourself instead.

Be careful when you go out
and watch out for traffic.

Yes.

Also, keep yourself warm
in order not to catch cold.

You must eat something at lunch time.

Otherwise, you'll have a
stomach-ache when you're in a rush.

I'll remember it.

Grandpa, am I right?

Okay, I'll take your
advice, little chap.

I'm off.

Goodbye!

Okay, stop playing

Do put on your clothes quickly as we've
to go in the Operating Theatre now.

You danced very well.

Thank you.

I can't see you to have
a little bit of panic.

Why do I have to be panic? It's
just to extract the bone marrow.

It's no bad. Will it affect
tonight's Ladies Night?

Ladies Night! Yeah!

It's also Anita's birthday tonight.

Anita's birthday?

No problem. You should tell her.

Today, you saved a life
of a Japanese's boy.

She'll think that you're very different.

If you can't get hold of
her, I'll bring you out.

Then... I need to consider it.

Consider?

It's only joking. Silly guy!

The operation went very well today.

Thank you!

Bye! Bye!

Hi!

Your coffee is ready.

Two. Two?

Isn't it usually only one?

Today is not the same.

Thank you.

Wait...

Old lady.

Thank you! It's nothing!

Officer Kao

It's for you, Bon.

For me?

It must be Yan Yan.

Aren't you helping Yan
Yan buying coffee everyday?

How can I bring it?

I'm not that narrow minded. Hold it.

You want me to take care
of Yan Yan in Japan, right?

I'll also take care of
her even without coffee.

Is it? Give me back.

No way!

If you are worry, go with her next time.

It's not late.

Thanks.

Yan Yan's coffee, very precious.

Let's go.

Bye. Bye.

What?

Your pair of trousers
wasn't broken today?

No!

You wasn't bit by Harry today?

It's getting old, can't
catch up with me any more.

Who's getting older?

I didn't say it's you.

Hurry up to get change.

How's it? Is it okay?

This is no. 18 already.

How can you remember it so clearly?

Of course, 18 lives.

Also, when it comes to no. 20...

You have to marry me.

You've said it, don't regret.

Work hard!

Okay! Work hard!

Dr Kao

Hey man. Is it serious?

Why you both asking the same question?

The way you asked made
things get serious.

You'd better extract
it for me right away.

Okay, don't worry, you'll be fine.

Okay.

No. 3

I must arrange the time so
as to accompany you next time.

Good.

If you really want, we go together.

Then, you go to the meetings for me.

Goodbye! Bye.

Take care of Yan Yan for me.

Goodbye!

You should go back to work.

It goes successfully!

8; B9; B10

This side! This side!

Go in a bit!

Fat guy, I caught you this time!

You're a ghost. I'm a ghost.

I'm not playing, I feel dizzy.

4...

Grandpa, I'm back.

I feel very dizzy and tired.

You alright.

Grandpa, did you practice?

Grandpa.

Do you know? Mum said that

only if you can hold up your thumb,

you should be able to
stand up and be alright.

So, you have to be good.

Work hard, understand?

Otherwise, you need to
back to the hospital.

Then, we can't see each other so often.

So, you really have to work hard.

Work hard...

Grandpa, alright.

It probably because of
the football just now...

The emergency ward sent
this medical record.

When he came here this afternoon, his
temperature was 38.7 degree Celsius,

heart beat 112 per minute.

Blood pressure 110,70.

Normal white blood cell
is sixteen thousand.

Haemoglobin is eight gram.

Platelet number is fifty thousand.

Patient's relatives are here.

Doctor

How do you do?

How's my son?

Initially, it's confirmed that
it's a problem related to the blood.

We still have to check
the actual situation.

The problem is related to the blood?

What does it mean?

Has he had anaemia for a long time?

Anaemia?

No. He was very well this morning.

No anaemia.

Don't get panic,

it could be something wrong physically.

So, let the boy has a good rest first.

This examination result
needs to take some time.

Don't worry too much.

Mrs Chan, it's me.

How's my papa?

This afternoon, it was lucky
that I went to have a look.

Otherwise, I can't imagine.

Luckily, it's just minor
scratches on the skin.

But, he hasn't eaten
anything for the whole day.

Is he okay?

He ate a little bit afterwards

and he's sleeping now.

Is Fai alright?

You didn't even say
a word before dieing...

Brother, have you seem my Mum?

Mum.

Mum

Mum

Mum

Fai.

Mum, where're you going?

Where have you been?

Fai, let's go.

Mrs Luk

Dr Lee, how's the
medical result of my son?

Mrs Luk, we don't want
to hide it from you.

Luk Fai's disease is a
serious non-lymphatic cell

Type M4 haemophilia

which is blood cancer.

In a simple terms,

it's a abnormal change of the
white blood cells in his blood.

And this abnormal
cells continue to grow,

at a great rate.

If it didn't cure in time,
the death rate is very high.

So, bone marrow transplant

have to be carried out immediately

after the chemotherapy

Otherwise, his life won't
last for more than 6 months.

It is due to a number of
recent successful cases,

being released afterwards.

Everyone has some
understanding about it.

Of course,

it can't be cured completely.

But, you should prepare it psychology.

Mrs Luk, you alright?

How's it?

You alright?

Mum, where've you been? It
took you so long to come back.

Mum, do you know?

Last night, there were
so many people crying.

Then, the guy next to me
was covered with white cloth

and taken away.

Mum, when can I leave the hospital?

What's the hurry? Doctor hasn't
completed the examination yet.

How can I not hurry?

I still have to watch football today.

Mum, I don't want to
stay in the hospital.

There are a lot of children get sick.

Mum, have you been listening to me?

I am listening.

Something wrong.

You look weird today.

Mum's stomach is not well.

You're always not having
your meals properly.

Is it hurt?

Mum is alright once Fai massage for me.

Now, you are a good boy.

Come and rest in bed.

Okay. I take a rest.

You get some stomach
tablets from the doctor.

Okay. I know.

Come, lie down.

Mum

Grandpa is alone at home,
who give him medicine?

You do have to worry.

Miss, I want to ask you.

Doctor say bone marrow
transplant is necessary.

Isn't it once it is
transplanted, it'll be fine?

When healthy bone
marrow are transplanted,

the new blood produced will
contain no cancer cells.

Of course, the disease will be cured.

But, it isn't that easy.

Why?

Bone marrow transplant
is very expensive.

It needs two to three
hundred thousands dollars.

Also, it must be matched.

It isn't easy to get
the right one to match.

The chance is only one in ten thousand.

The right match is very difficult.

Haven't you seem there are
so many children waiting?

What can I do?

Nothing, just wait.

Depends your luck.

Who? It's me.

Mrs Chan.

What's the matter with you?

I am telling you Fai has blood cancer.

Blood cancer? Yes.

Can't be.

I also don't believe.

Then, we'd better quickly
donate the blood to him.

Is that work?

Of course.

Well. You all wait for
me tomorrow morning.

We can go to the hospital together.

You go now. Okay.

Officer

Luk Fai's bone marrow exam
report is not so optimistic.

I know. I've seen the report.

Make an appointment for
me with Luk Fai's mum.

I want to find out,

how much psychological
preparation has she got.

Okay. I'll inform Mrs
Luk as soon as possible.

Send Luk Fai's genes arrangement
information out quickly.

It has been sent off.

Including Guangzhou,
Jinan, Wuhan & Chengdu.

What about Taiwan & Hong Kong?

Were also sent.

My boy.

Were you good yesterday?

Did you sleep well?

You know? Grandpa is
very much thinking of you.

Don't you want me?

Are you sure you don't want me?

See what I have brought for you?

Fai, you see.

Mum has to go back
to look after Grandpa.

And also have to hand in
the script to Auntie Wong.

You know?

Mum, when can I really go?

I think a few more days.

Anyway, Mum will accompany
with you these few days,

okay?

No, I don't want to
stay in the hospital.

I want to go home.

Fai, you're the best.

Mum has told you earlier,

there's no other choice except
staying in the hospital if you're sick.

I know you're very bored.

Okay.

What about you speak to Dr Lee.

If he can let you go, I
bring you home right away.

What do you think?

You know, Mum is very much
like to bring you home.

Without you at home, Mum
has lost an assistant.

You see, no one will do
the massage for Grandpa.

And no one will give medicine
to Grandpa too, right?

Mum, what diseases have I got?

Why is it my whole body has no strength?

Mum, where're you going?

Mum has to go the toilet
and will be back right away.

Why are you here? Are
you looking for me?

Beijing has just admitted a new patient.

A boy who is eight years old.

What's the name?

Called Luk Fai.

Luk Fai?

Right, there was a girl called Yin Yin,

Has she got the right match?

Not yet.

Still on the waiting list.

The blood samples are so few.

I think it's very difficult.

Sometimes, this job do
make people desperate.

It's not.

In fact, I think no matter
how many times of failure,

and if only one is successful,

this job is still worthwhile.

I understand.

But there're so many
people don't understand.

Why are you giving up
your original doctor's work

and go to work for the
Care Unit as volunteer?

I also don't know.

I just like this job.

I work happily.

Dr Kao, sorry.

Patient in the Operating
Theatre is ready.

Can you go and have a look? Okay.

I'm off first.

Who do you want?

I...

That day my Mum and I saw you to
have hair cut outside the door.

Do you stay in this hospital too?

What's wrong with you?

Why did you let your mum

to shave your head?

It's because my disease
would cause my hair to shed.

It hurts my mum.

So, I let my mum to have it shaved.

Are you also having haemophilia?

I don't know.

You look pretty healthy
and same as I was.

But since you stay here,

it must be the same.

Don't you know about it?

Haemophilia can whiten
the color of the blood.

When the blood is damaged,
would be hair shed?

You'll find out more in the future.

I think you should be okay.

Sister, your picture is very pretty.

Do you like it?

Yes!

Then, I give it to you.

Thank you, sister.

Since I was admitted
to hospital till now,

I carry this pair of shoes everyday.

Today, it's the first time I wear it.

Sister, you danced very well!

But, you have to promise me,

if you really become a Ballet dancer,

you must invite me to
see your "Swan Lake" show.

I won't forget.

That day, I'll invite Dad, Mum

and also you

to see my performance.

We surely can wait for
that day to come, right?

No problem.

What?

We make a deal for our promises.

Then, we both can't change our mind.

Done and no change for one hundred year.

I'll wait for you to
become the real No. 10.

Then, you should invite
me to see the World Cup.

No problem.

Sister, your hand is very cold.

I can't stand cold weather.

Then, you come close to my
body. I can stand the cold.

Feel warmer now?

Will you forget me? Fai.

No, when we leave the hospital,

you're still my sister
and I'm your brother.

Okay. We'll keep as it is

until we become old.

Please don't worry, we must try our best

to cure your child.

How can I not to worry?

Dr Lee, I'm his mum.

But I look like an idiot now,

I know nothing.

How's my son?

What will happen later on?

I don't know anything.
How can I not to worry?

Dr Lee, can you guarantee
to save my son's life?

I can't guarantee anything for you.

But you must believe me.

We'll try our very
best to cure your son.

This is our duty as
doctor, you understand?

Don't worry!

The dreadful haemophilia,
accordingly to my knowledge,

western medicine has a method
for the bone marrow transplant.

That's currently
considered to be better.

Having the experience of hospital life,

you'll know the abnormality
and weakness of life.

So many lovely children,

they still haven't
seem the future rainbow.

But they have to go through
this kind of torture.

My son is one of them.

A few months later,

we perhaps can't see them again.

My son is waiting for
the bone marrow matching.

By waiting for the coming
of a new life again.

As a mother,

I'm not able to give him a second one.

The only thing I can give him,

is to let him live happily
everyday for the rest of the days.

91; B92; B93; B94

95; B96; B97; B98

99; B100

It's great! Uncle Chan,
you broke the record!

102; B103; B105

Very good.

I've been very busy lately,

so I haven't got time to see you.

Where's Mum?

Mum has gone to hand in the scripts.

Uncle bought you a new
football. Do you like it?

Yes! Thank you!

Uncle, this ball is for adults.

No problem.

You wait until you leave the
hospital. I'll play with you.

Mum, Uncle Chan is here.

Kin Kao, why are you coming?

I specially take a day off

to see Fai.

Thank you.

Fai, it's late. I've to go now.

Goodbye Uncle Chan!

Goodbye! Hope you get well soon!

Thank you Uncle!

Kuen, there's one thing I
want to discuss with you.

Uncle Chan, don't forget
to wait for me to come out

and bring me to play football.

Alright!

Kuen,

this is our police's
colleague a little gratuity.

Hope that you'll accept.

Kin Kao, no...

I can't take this money.

No, I learn from my Mum.

Fai's medical fee is very expensive.

We've contributed about
ten thousand dollars.

It isn't a lot, hope you take it.

Kuen, Fai will be alright, don't worry.

Okay. It's late, I have to go.

Thank you, Kin Kao.

Today, I received an appreciative
letter from a little guy in Japan.

He said that he had recovered very well.

He can go home in one
to two month's time.

That's great.

He particularly wanted
to thanks for you.

For what?

Especially is to you.

And also Allen, the bone marrow donor.

You see, he also sent
us this pair of doll.

It's lovely! Very lovely!

Officer...

News just came from Shenyang that

they found a couple of right matches.

It's great! For who?

Luk Fai.

Who is the donor?

A lady called Wong Mei.

She is 32 years old and is a Librarian.

Good, very good. Yes.

But before it's confirmed,

don't tell the relatives
about this news.

Okay.

Donor's will is also a problem.

So, we've to contact the
other side immediately.

Okay.

SHEN YANG

How do you do, doctor.

I am Wong Mei.

Fine. I'm Lee Chung.

Fine, Dr Lee.

I can't imagine...
You're a pregnant woman.

Does it matter?

It's okay. I think to save a
person's life is more important.

Of course, it's a top priority
to save a person's life.

But both yourself and your child's
safety are also very important

Although there're examples of pregnant
women having bone marrow extraction.

However, if there's any possibility
causing harm to the baby,

we'd better try to avoid it.

We do appreciate you very much.

It's a pity that I can't help.

Thank you.

I learnt that Luk Fai
had a high temperature.

Luckily, he's okay.

For children who got
this kind of diseases

is really something cry one's heart out.

Sometimes,

I don't know whether
I can take it anymore.

Please let me cry now,

I have no more tears.

When facing this kind of thing,

we as mothers have no other choice.

We can only do our best.

So my advice to you, is to take it easy.

I went to see a Chinese
doctor a few days ago.

He persuaded me to make use of
the western medical treatment.

He said bone marrow transplant
method is the last resort.

You see Chinese medical
doctor also believes in it.

Is there any other alternative?

Now, I only know

Dr Lee is a very trust worth person.

He treats other people's children

like his own.

It's more than half a
year, if there's no him,

I'm afraid I can't last till today.

I do trust him.

If he can't even save Yin Yin...

I think this is fate.

So, for both of us,

only persistent.

Persistent is the only way.

Luckily,

Yin Yin is a very
mature kid in the family.

Sometimes, she even comfort me.

She said...

Mum, you have to hold on to it.

You must hold on.

It isn't easy to come to see a picture.

Can't you relax a bit?

Please put aside the
work for the time being.

Since there're still half an hour to go,

you wait here, I'll be ready soon.

But your Mum wanted
me to take care of you.

If you were tired to death,

what shall I tell your Mum?

I think you've done a good job.

No, have a rest first.

Have your eyes closed,

rest for a while.

Okay, then.

Happy Birthday!

You still remember my birthday!

Of course. I don't even remember myself.

It's very pretty!

Your heart...

all devoted to the Care Unit

I almost forgot.

How can it be?

It's very pretty, thank you!

Luk Fai's match!

This is no. 19 already!

Go back quickly!

But...

in that case, our film will be over.

See it next time.

TAITUNG PRISON

Are you Mr Ng Sung Yung?

Sorry, I've seen your information.

You born in 1959.

What's matter?

We sent you this flower.

Hope you can get out
from the prison soon!

I'm Suen Yan Yan

from the Care Unit of Taipei Hospital.

The things is

there is a boy from
Beijing, called Luk Fai.

He has haemophilia.

He probably can survive

for another half year.

This's why he needed the bone
marrow transplant urgently.

My bone marrow?

Yes, it was September 12 last year

Didn't you have the blood
donation at Kaohsiung?

You're very lucky!

There're so many people
have the blood donation.

But, the chance to match
successfully is slim.

For you,

you can even save a person's
life in such a short time.

So, you're really very lucky!

I really feel happy for you.

You shouldn't be happy too
early as I didn't say to donate.

Why?

You were volunteer for the blood
donation and wish to help people yourself.

That was at that time only.

I was able to go round
everywhere at that time.

I'd never expect.

Mr Ng, but...

So what? Shit!

In my life,

this was the first time in
jail of such poor condition!

I wanted to be a good man.

Also, my business was doing not bad.

He talked about things
which were ages ago.

Then, I was taken here somehow.

Mr Ng...

Mr Ng, would you please
consider it again?

There's no need to be unhappy.

How come?

At first, it was a pregnant woman.

Now, this guy is like that.

What can Luk Fai do?

There must be a way.

Is there any other way?

You should know how difficult
it is to get the right matching.

It's already not easy to get two so far.

But now the situation is like that.

It could be that Ng Sung
Yung, has been kept too long.

Thus, his mood is a bit change.

He probably will change
his mind later on.

I also don't know.

He only said to me he wanted
to be a good person at first,

but this society didn't
give him a chance.

Thus, he became a bad guy.

As he went for the blood
donation, it showed that...

he did wanted to help people.

He said that he donated
blood for running only.

So he didn't know what made
him donate blood originally.

Really?

Then, what can we do?

Try again.

I won't give it up.

I've spent so much money on you.

Lying ill in bed but who
would bring me medicine.

Hung Shun died but life remains alive.

Slaves... Ah... Slaves

Worrying that arrows will
punch through your body

And your body buried no where

Great! Good!

Kids, be quiet.

I know, Auntie.

Good boy.

Thank you for coming to see me.

When can you be discharge?

Fai, where has your blood gone?

What does this mean?

All the adults have the
blood transfusion for you.

I don't need blood transfusion.

We also have to do the
blood transfusion for you.

Donate what? I wasn't injured.

You'd better ask your Mum.

Why are you touching my head?

Is it...

those who are bald will go to heaven.

What do you mean by going to heaven?

Silly guy, it means dead.

It can't be.

Will your hair shed?

Fai, do you have this disease?

What kind of disease have I got?

Didn't your Mum tell you?

But, I learnt from my Grandma,

yours is haemophilia
disease, a serious one.

It's cancer...

So, what can we do?

That's enough, let's go.

Good-bye, Fai!

See you tomorrow.

No...

I don't want to have my
head shaved. Please don't!

I don't want my hair to
get shed. I don't want it!

Please don't! I don't want
to have my head shaved...

Yung, you have to take it easy.

Our life have almost gone half way.

We've been going in and out
from the prison all the way.

Honestly, what a waste of our life!

People outside treat
us like waste material.

Our family have no one to respect them.

In the end, it's already too late.

We can't go back and
start all over again.

Why don't we do something meaningful?

At least this can relieve
your uneasy feelings inside.

You think about it.

If this kid without you,

he probably can't even
see the sun tomorrow.

Just assume that your
ancestor owed them.

If you don't speak it out

No one knows

Sometimes, it needs to air-out

A full chest of sorrow

Do you like swan?

Okay, and you?

Yes, I like.

I hope I can be the same as swan.

I can fly to the sky.

Then, I have no more
vaccinations and medicine.

But your Mum can't find you.

If I were there,

Mum didn't have to worry about me.

What sort of a place?

Place where swans go.

Can I go as well?

I don't know.

If you had the right
bone marrow matching,

you could stay with your Mum.

Can I go to see you?

No, you can't come back.

Is the place very far away?

It's just above there.

Above the blue sky.

Yin Yin, how do you feel? Yin Yin...

Yin Yin, what happen to you?

Yin Yin, wake up!

Yin Yin...

Yin Yin, wake up!

Yin Yin, wake up!

Yin Yin...

Help...

Help! Help!

Nurse!

Nurse, Yin Yin's fainted!

What happen?

Yin Yin has fainted!

Auntie, has Yin Yin passed away?

Auntie, will I be the same as Yin Yin?

Once I became bald, I'd go
to a very far away place.

Auntie, don't cry.

Yin Yin said there was no need to cry.

What else did she tell you?

She would go to a place
where she could dance everyday

and wouldn't get sick.

So, you shouldn't cry.

Auntie...

Auntie, don't worry.

I'll go to see her.

Grandpa...

Grandpa, you'd better
hold up you thumb quickly.

Grandpa, this might be
the last time I help you.

Grandpa, don't worry.

Mum will help you in the future.

Grandpa, I've to go.

You know, I got a very serious illness

and soon will get bald.

Then, I'll go to another
place same as Yin Yin.

Grandpa, I don't want
to go to the hospital.

I'm scare. I've to hide myself.

Grandpa, please don't tell Mum.

I have to hide myself.

So, they can't take me away.

Mum

Why were you running out
from the hospital secretly?

I miss Grandpa. I don't want
to go back to the hospital.

But your illness hasn't been cured yet.

I'm not ill.

Let's wait for the medical result first.

You still haven't
finished the checking up.

Please hold on for a few more days.

Only a few more days, okay?

Mum, I don't want to have
my head shaved. I'm scare.

Shave your head?

Who said that?

Yin Yin shaved hers.

Then, she died afterwards.

Don't talk nonsense!

Again,

Mum won't allow them to shave your head.

Yin Yin's mum was saying the same thing.

But she had the head shaved at last

and died.

You both aren't the same, Fai!

We are the same!

I know I have haemophilia.

Soon, I'll die same as Yin Yin.

Fai...

You don't have to
deny. I know everything.

Fai...

Mum didn't want to deny it.

I only think that you're too young.

You may not understand.

In fact, you need not to worry.

For your illness, it's because...

there're some unhealthy
thing inside your blood.

Thus, your bone marrow can't
produce any healthy blood.

But this is not important.

As the doctor said, once you'd
the bone marrow transplanted,

you'll be alright.

I don't believe!

I don't want to go back to the hospital!

Fai, why are you being
not understanding?

Now, there's a man in Taiwan who
donates his bone marrow to you.

If you do run away, how
can they cure your illness?

My illness is incurable!

Mum, I beg you.

I don't want to go back
to the hospital. I'm scare.

Grandpa, protect me!

Fai, you're the best.

Good boy, Fai...

don't run away, come back.

You come back and listen to me.

Come back...

We're all working hard on
this. I'm not going back; K

You can't be like that,
listen to me, Fai...

You look at me.

You look at me, Fai.

You tell me.

Have Mum ever cheated you?

I know very well how you feel...

I know how scare in your heart.

Mum is also very frighten.

Do you know?

I always think you're
the man in the family.

No matter what will happen.

We handle it together, aren't we?

Now you have this illness.

I know how hard your feel.

Mum feels the same way, Fai.

But, we need to handle it together.

I know, you won't leave me alone.

You won't let me alone to face it,

right?

Fai, don't you want to
become a football star?

You must hold on to it!

If you gave it up now,

Mum would look down upon you.

Mum, can I still play football?

Of course!

Do you know? If the donor's bone marrow

can fit into your body.

Your illness can be cured and you
can also play football afterwards.

Fai, you have to trust yourself and Mum.

Mum, I won't run away.

I want to cure my illness with you.

Because I want to play football.

Mum, don't cry.

In fact, I don't want to go.

I miss you and Grandpa.

TAITUNG AIRPORT

TAIPEI SUNG SHAN AIRPORT

It seems nothing can hold you back.

Don't give up anything.

Thank you, Mr Ng.

Thank you.

This is Dr Kao who will
do the operation for you.

Very handsome!

Thanks!

Please sit.

Why?

It's because you're our Joss.

Joss?

No need.

I'm alright.

It's okay, Mr Ng, please.

What do you really want?

My son is a good person.

Why are you cheating him?

Why were you calling him to
extract his the bone marrow?

I do think you are a good guy.

Why don't you find a proper job?

You come to cheat my son instead.

No, Auntie.

Bone marrow extraction won't
do any harm to the body.

The new bone marrow
will soon grow again.

You're talking rubbish!

You think it's as easy as water tap

to turn it on and off for water.

That's good.

Since you're in charge, why
don't you come & join him?

Don't do it, let's go.

Me?

What? Let's go!

You scare?

It's not that simple as you think!

Go!

Mum

Yung

I told you not to come.

Were you force to come?

Yung, isn't it something wrong with
your brain being too long in the prison?

Don't you know that

bone marrow extraction doesn't work!

Mum, it should be alright.

Why are you making a fuss?

Auntie, there's nothing to worry.

Give bone marrow is just the same
as blood transfusion. Very safe.

Yes, don't worry. I am a doctor.

I can guarantee that you it'll be fine.

Yes, he is the officer in charge
of the blood and oncology section.

He is...

Since you're a doctor,
you should save people.

Why don't you extract
yours but my son instead?

Donating bone marrow must have
the genes matched each other.

If it doesn't fit,
the donation is wasted.

Who are you trying to deceive? No way!

Mum

Mum...

Yung

You used to say to me to be a good son,

and required me to respect others.

But I've been doing
bad things all the way.

Also, I was in and out
the prison all the time.

Mum, from today's onwards,

please let me start my
new life again, alright?

I beg you and let me do one good thing.

Thank you!

Starting from today,

bone marrow transplant
is starting the countdown.

Tomorrow,

we'll start non-destructive
therapy on Luk Fai.

All the cancer cells in his
body will be killed gradually.

Then, we can wait for the transplant
of the healthy bone marrow.

If the donor can't supply
the bone marrow in time,

or there's any accident
happened during the delivery.

The patient will die undoubtedly.

Luk Fai will not be able to walk
out the non-bacteria room alive.

Fai, don't be afraid.

We should all know,

bone marrow can only keep for 24 hours.

Especially this time,

the bone marrow has to
deliver from Taipei to Beijing.

In addition, the journey
is not direct and far away.

So, we've to plan it properly this time.

Absolutely no mistake is allowed.

Mum, don't worry. I can hold on to it.

Don't worry.

Mum, can you promise me one thing?

Sure.

I want a genuine
No. 10 Football T-shirt.

When I finished this treatment,

I can put on the new Football T-shirt.

Okay.

Fai, Mum loves you.

I love you too, Mum.

This is no. 19 already.

There's only one left,
then you will have to...

marry me.

You can't deny.

Work hard!

Work hard!

Dr Kao.

Thanks for the hard work. Thanks.

Mr Ng, how do you feel? Alright?

Dr Kao.

Are you nervous?

After I've seen all these,

it's really a bit nervous.

Don't worry, it should be o. k.

Start anaesthesia

Dr Kao

What's the matter?

I want you to do me a favor.

Please say.

Can I refuse to take
aesthetic injection?

Why?

It's very painful.

It needs over 100 injections.

I did so many bad things before,

I want to take this
chance to mitigate my sin.

But this is against the regulation.

I know. Thus, I ask you for a favor.

Today is so special.

This is the date that
I'll start a new life.

I'd like Dr Kao to give me a chance.

Dr Kao, please give me a chance.

Okay. I give you an
injection to see how it goes.

If you can't stand it, I'll
give you aesthetic injection.

Thanks!

The second one.

Dr Kao

What?

Isn't it very painful?

Yes. Yes?

Are you alright?

A little bit nervous.

Listen to the music and relax a bit.

Okay...

I still haven't vaccinated yet.

Relax a bit more.

No, Dr Kao...

Dr Kao, why are you shaking?

Everybody be careful,
there's an earthquake.

Don't panic! Protect the patients!

Dr Kao,

is your needle inside the bottom?

It's taken out already, don't worry.

Everybody has to be calm.

Once the electricity is resume,
we'll carry on the operation.

If we can't send out
the bone marrow today,

we can't save the kid Luk Fai in China.

We carry on if it's ready.

You okay?

Will there be any danger?

No, don't worry.

On the safe side,

shall I give you an
aesthetic injection, okay?

Okay...

Check the instrument.

Be careful! There's some aftershock!

Relax, don't panic.

It'll soon over.

Great!

Okay.

There's an earthquake with a
magnitude of 6.3 scale in Taiwan area.

The core of the earthquake is 10.8 km

from the east station
of Miao Li San Yi Centre.

Depth is 23.4 km.

At this moment, due to the earthquake,

all the roads traffic
are seriously affected.

Every section of the highways
has been seriously paralyzed.

Telecommunication is also badly hit.

Moreover, most of us do concern about

the bone marrow extraction
operation at the Taipei hospital.

It's also affected by this
sudden serious earthquake.

...to confirm the result.

The receivers of the bone
marrow is someone called Luk Fai.

He is 8 years old from Beijing.

In other words,

the delivery of bone marrow
will be another scene of

long journey transportation and rush.

Have you found Bon?

Not yet. There's no signal.

But he has set off earlier.

He should have arrived
the airport before us.

Everything is in a mess
after the earthquake.

Hope everything goes well.

It's because of the earthquake,

all the main roads and
traffic are running into chaos

and congestion.

For the air traffic,

all the flights are maintaining the
normal schedules for the time being.

This is the report for the moment.

God, it's too bad!

What shall we do?

We ring up Bon and say
that we'll a bit late.

I've kept ringing him
but can't get through.

Excuse me.

Are there any flights to Hong Kong

after 5 pm?

Mum, I feel very painful.

Fai, be good.

Just give a bit more patient,
Uncle will soon be here.

Mum

I want to wear my new football T-shirt.

Let me think about it.

Please.

Alright.

Fai, do you know why Mum

bought you such large size?

It's because when you grow up,

you can still wear it.

So, you don't have to
ask me get you a new one.

Mum, you're so stingy.

Mum, can I wait till...

the day to put on this
new football T-shirt.

Of course.

On that day,

Mum and Grandpa will go
to see your match too.

Fai, you have to hold on to it.

Don't let your Mum down, okay?

Mum

Chi Yuen, we can't move as
it's block at the far end.

Would it be the earthquake
damaged the road?

I go and have a look.

How's it?

It looks like there was an accident.

Really?

Very serious.

Is there any other road?

I've a look.

Come back quickly!

I am a doctor, can I help?

Good, inside there...

Don't touch her...

I am a doctor, excuse me.

Her breath and pulse are stop.

Nurse...

This patient needed
emergency treatment, quickly!

Carry her out first!

Be careful, stretcher...

Stretcher...

Quick, help her for emergency treatment!

Don't move the patient.

His leg might have a fracture,
help him to fix it in position.

How's it? Can you move?

Telephone can't get through
because of the earthquake.

Are you alright? Where is the pain?

Leg... My leg hurts!

Hello, Bon.

I couldn't get through
your telephone at all.

My God, where are you?

Can you move?

I don't know where we are.

You don't know?

What do you mean by you don't know?

How can one don't know where one is?

No, there was a traffic
accident ahead of us.

Chi Yuen is helping to save people.

It should be alright, be careful.

My daughter? Where's my daughter?

Is she okay?

All yours.

Okay.

Dr Kao must have forgotten the time.

Ms Suen, do you mind to hurry up a bit?

If we can't catch the plane
at 5 p. M to Hong Kong,

then we certainly can't
catch the one at 7:50 p. m.

The last flight from
Hong Kong to Beijing.

Then, we're screwed!

I know! I know!

Okay, bye!

Chi Yuen!

Chi Yuen!

Chi Yuen, alright?

You get on first...

I've already contacted with Bon.

He said that

if we couldn't make it in
30 minutes to the airport,

we won't be able to catch the
last flight to Beijing at 7:50 p. m.

Excuse me.

Are you listening?

No problem, go round the lanes.

Was that man okay?

He hurt his chest.

Life should be no danger.

You really want to go with the driver?

If we made a mistake, it'll be finished.

The driver should know
the routes very well.

Also, we have no other choice.

Time is running out.

What is the matter?

Which is the right route to the airport?

Listen to me, I'm so sure.

I go the airport everyday.

There's a chimney in
the front, can't you see?

Then, turn right.

Thank you! Thank you!

The earthquake has
just over, be careful!

Watch out!

Oh no!

I'll go and shove it.

Give way Brother Cow!

We're in a hurry, don't come over...

Go over there, quick...

That's it. Don't come out.

Its head is blocking the way.

No problem, I'll watch out.

Go away, go away.

Don't come over here.

Are you sure this is correct?

Should be correct.

But, I think...

I think there's no roads in the front.

This is a property road and it
should be connecting to outside.

How soon shall we arrive?

It's only 15 minutes left.

We may not be able to make it.

Sit still!

There's no road...

The bridge is broken, what shall we do?

Drive over it, be careful!

Be careful!

My hand seems to be dislocated.

Incredible... the bend
starts with the slant.

Yan Yan!

I can't open the door!

You try my side.

You okay?

Bone marrow... One pack is missing!

How come it's missing?

I don't know.

Finished... what can we do?

It's over there!

Driver, do you mind to go a bit fast!

Thanks for your help. We're in a hurry.

TAIPEI CKS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

Bon, quick!

Quick!

What happened to you?

Let's go inside first.
Can we still make it?

There's a flight to Hong
Kong in 40 minutes later.

The last flight from Hong
Kong to Beijing is impossible.

Impossible! What shall be do?

Don't panic. I've already
contacted with the Airline.

There's still no news at the moment.

You'd better go and check.

Okay. You wait and I go and ask again.

Ms... Excuse me.

I've just explained to you
regarding that thing, how's it now?

It's my fault.

I only thought of the emergency
work and forgot the time.

This ended up of this delay.

If we couldn't catch the flight,
what would happen to Luk Fai?

You shouldn't blame yourself.

Under such situation,

no one will turn a blind eye
and do nothing to save life.

Also, there's still a chance.

Aren't we still waiting for the news?

Is your hand alright?

The Dragon Air in H.K. Have
already known about the delivery

of your bone marrow
business There's no problem.

Okay?

Okay.

Thank you...

Thank you!

Quick... Get ready for boarding!

The airline has already
contacted the H.K. Airport.

They said

the last flight of Dragon Air
is willing to wait for you.

Really? It's great!

What's it?

It hurts very much...

It hurts very much!

What are you doing?

You want me to go on board like this?

This is...

His thumb is really can hold up!

Luk Fai, Congratulations!

Congratulations! Luk Fai.

Do you know who is this gentleman?

He's the person who has
donated his bone marrow to you.

Uncle!

All bone marrow donations would not
do any harm to the person at all.
