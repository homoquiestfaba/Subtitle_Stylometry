      <i> The end of the age:</i>      


     <i> Some men fear it is</i>       
     <i> a time of destruction,</i>    


  <i> while others welcome it</i>      
  <i> as the ushering in of grace.</i> 


   <i> For ages they tried</i>         
   <i> to warn us of its coming.</i>   


 <i> They told us</i>                  
 <i> both to beware and to rejoice.</i>


   <i> Over time this revelation</i>   
   <i> has been rejected,</i>          


   <i> diluted,</i>                    
   <i> ignored by all but a few.</i>   


<i>And the voices of</i>               
<i>righteous men have been drowned</i> 


     <i> and silenced beneath</i>      
     <i> a tide of wickedness.</i>     


         <i> Years passed.</i>         


         <i> War begat war.</i>        


       <i> Greed begat greed.</i>      


 <i> And men laughed, secure in</i>    
 <i> their dominion over the earth.</i>


    <i> Even as the signs began,</i>   


      <i> great floods, fire,</i>      
      <i> famine, pestilence,</i>      


     <i> they laughed,</i>             
     <i> lost in their hubris.</i>     


 <i> When the end came,</i>            
 <i> it came as it was prophesied,</i> 


   <i> like a thief in the night.</i>

creature they sent

                 the same thing.


Yeah, we're such                
a burden, I know.               


                Uh-oh, too late.


Give the man back               
his property, young lady.

Brother,                        
you are cold-blooded.           


You killed those                
three boys today,               


and your hands                  
aren't even shakin'.            


You're standing here            
in my lawn, easy as you please, 


drinking my wife's              
raspberry lemonade.             


What service were you in, son,  
and what did they do to you?    


           I don't know what    
           you're talkin' about.


Alright.                        


I know sometimes                
there are things                


<i>a man just doesn't</i>              
<i>wanna talk about.</i>               


<i>I know.</i>                         


I know where                    
you're comin' from.             


I've been there.                


Yeah, I've been there.          


<i>The blood, the bullets,</i>         


the bodies lying                
facedown in the mud.            


Prayin' that you'll live        
the next 3 seconds.             


Then you come home,             
back here,                      


and everybody's actin'          
like it never happened.         


People pass you by,             
livin' their lives,             


<i>complaining</i>                     
<i>about their mortgages</i>           


<i>and leaky septic tanks,</i>         


and talkin' about               
when dinner's gonna be,         


and you just can't              
plug in to any of that          


after what you've seen.         


<i>None of it seems real.</i>          


Yeah, comin' home is the one    
thing they never train you for. 


You need help.                  


You need a bridge.              


                   A bridge?    
                   You mean God?


I'm talkin' about puttin'       
your faith and trust            


in God's only son,              
Jesus Christ.                   


<i>He said, "Come unto me,</i>         
<i>all who are weary and burdened,</i> 


and I will give you rest."      
And that's the truth, Josh.     


Jesus is a bridge,              
a bridge that can take you home.


        Look Frank,             
        I'm sorry to disappoint,


          but I choose the vest.


What's that?                    


           Your three questions.


    What would I put my faith in
    to save my family?          


Oh yeah.                        


         My wife and my daughter
         give me strength.      


          They're the ones      
          that save me, not God.


<i>(Frank)</i>                         
<i>Not God? Alright.</i>               
<i>Well, maybe.</i>                    


I still think                   
you're runnin',                 


tryin' to escape from           
the things you've done.         


I bet you keep your family      
at a distance, too, right?      


You do, I know,                 


<i>but you don't</i>                   
<i>have to, you know?</i>              


It doesn't matter what          
you've done in the past.        


You can wipe it all away        
and start a whole new life.     


           Frank, I respect you,


     and I appreciate what      
     you're trying to do for me.


   And I'm glad this whole      
   God thing worked out for you,


         but I don't think      
         it's gonna work for me.


Yeah, alright.                  
Maybe.                          


Just think about it             
though, alright?                


'Cause it's all                 
out there for you,              


the freedom,                    
the peace, your family.         


It's all over there             
on the other side.              


You're tryin' to reach it,      
and you can't.                  


Jesus is the bridge.            


Jesus can help                  
bring you home.

             Mister,            
             sorry about before.


                Maybe you       
                can help me out?


Do you want me                  
to call the sheriff?            


                         Uh, no.
                         Um...  


                 I could really 
                 use some money.


                Do you think    
                you can help me?


It's not that                   
kind of help you need.          


             Wait.              


             <i> Wait.</i>             


             Look, I can't just 
             hand you the money.


<i>(female)</i>                        
<i>I get it.</i>                       


I'm scum of the earth,

              I didn't say that.


<i>(female)</i>                        
<i>Of course you</i>                   
<i>didn't say that.</i>                


So righteous.

<i>you something.</i>                  


<i>You're fake,</i>

<i>Everybody steals.</i>               


<i>Everybody lies.</i>                 


You're no different.            


    Look, I'm not saying        
    that I'm better than anyone.


               I was a different
               person once.     


         I did a lot of terrible
         things, but I changed. 


             Changed everything.


                 It is possible.


Let me guess.                   
You found Jesus.                


                 I found Rachel,
                 my wife.       


Wow, you really                 
are fooling yourself            


'cause people

they pretend to change,         


and then they                   
act like hypocrites.            


I'm telling you,                
there is no force on earth

       You look like you're

You have no idea.               


             Yeah, times        
             are tough all over.


<i>It feels like the whole world's</i> 
<i>fallin' apart, if you ask me.</i>   


                  Where'd all   
                  the heroes go?


                  What happened 
                  to the Titans?


     <i> I mean, they had the power</i>
     <i> to change the world.</i>      


         <i> When I look around now</i>


         all I see are children 
         cryin' for their mamas.


No, they're still out there     
on the front lines.             


I've known                      
some good men.                  


Fought alongside of 'em.        


            So you're a warrior?


       You don't look like much.


       <i> Makes me sick when I see</i>
       <i> warriors takin' orders</i>  


               from little men  
               with little ties.


       <i> You know, someday soon</i>  
       <i> there'll be a reckoning.</i>


            It's when the Titans
            will stand up.      


    They'll take back this world
    from the lawyers            


            and the politicians.


               What do you      
               think about that?


I think what you call a Titan,  
I call a tyrant;                


<i>men without compassion,</i>         
<i>men who murder and steal,</i>       


call it their right.            


God willing, there will         
always be men like me           


to put the tyrants              
in their place.                 


Thanks for the change.          


                Glad I could    
                take care of ya.
