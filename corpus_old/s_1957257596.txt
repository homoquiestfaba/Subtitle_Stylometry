Gee, Eddie I'm so nervous.

Oh, you'll be just great.

But this is the Palace.

I mean, this is the show
business' Hall of Fame.

Oh, they'll love you.

Just imagine Don,
forty million people watching.

That's eighty million eyes.

Fifteen seconds, Mr. Knotts.

Fifteen seconds?

I'll never make it, Eddie!

You've got to.
They're waiting.

Harvey, how do I look?

Great.
I've dressed you superbly.

Five seconds.

Are you sure I look all right?

Okay, here I go.

Ahh!

What's the matter?

Not again!

Get the pants.

Get the pants!

â™ª Say hello to Mr. Excitement

â™ª Dynamic Mr. Excitement

â™ª All he has to do is arrive

â™ª And the dull old scene
becomes alive

â™ª Tip your lid to Mr. Excitement

â™ª The man who calls
all the shots

â™ª That dashing, dapper,
dangerous can be

â™ª Mr. Excitement himself

â™ª Don Knotts

Don't go away.

But Mr. Knotts, you're the host.

You're supposed
to open the show.

Yeah I know...

Would you just
excuse me a minute?

What does the host
normally do to open the show?

Oh well, most hosts
usually open with a joke.

Oh well, this is kind
of embarrassing but I
don't know any jokes,

that I could tell here.

Gee, Mr. Knotts for a star
you don't seem very secure.

You're not kidding.

Grauman's Chinese theater
has my footprints and
silly putty.

That's pretty funny.

Hey, why don't you use
that for your opening joke?

What's that?

You know, Grauman's Chinese.

He is?

Oh I, I'm so nervous I don't
even know what I'm saying.

I just...

I'll tell you what's wrong.

I mean, I know you're
all going to leave me

and I'm going to be on the stage
by myself and that scares me.

Oh. Well...

Hey, you know,
the Hollywood Palace
Chorale is here.

Maybe I could bring them out

and maybe you could
work with them.

Oh, you mean you...they
could sing and maybe I could...

Conduct them!

Lead them.
Yeah!

Is that good?
Yeah, thank you. Bless you.

Okay, would you send
the singers out please?

Good evening.

I would like to open the
show by conducting the
Hollywood Palace Chorale

in a song that I have chosen
and the name of the song...

Moonlight Bay.
Moonlight Bay!

For your listening pleasure.

â™ª We were sailing along
on Moonlight Bay.

â™ª We could hear
the voices ringing.

â™ª They seem to say.

â™ª You have stolen my heart

â™ª Now don't go away...

â™ª We were sailing along
on Moonlight Bay.

â™ª We could hear the
voices ringing.

â™ª They seem to say.

â™ª You have stolen my heart...

â™ª We were sailing along
on Moonlight Bay.

â™ª We could hear
the voices ringing.

â™ª They seem to say.

â™ª You have stolen my heart
now don't go away.

â™ª As we sang our...

â™ª We were sailing along
on Moonlight Bay.

â™ª We could hear
the voices ringing.

â™ª They seem to say...

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

Good evening
ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you so much and
welcome to the Hollywood Palace.

You know, I'm awfully glad
to get this chance to return
to the Palace.

I've been so busy
doing feature pictures.

My latest picture of course
is "The Love God"

and I'll be perfectly
frank with you.

I'm just sick and tired
of being a sex symbol.

What do you want?

Flowers for the star.

You don't give flowers
during the show, after the show.

Who they from?

Me, silly.

Anyway, now ladies
and gentleman,

every adjective in the book
has been used to describe

the beauty and the talent
of my first guest

so I'll just use my own
hip expressions.

Here's the keen, swell, peachy,
Joey Heatherton.

â™ª I want to thank you for letting me be myself, again.

â™ª I want to thank you for
letting me be myself again.

â™ª Ummmm...

â™ª Oh yeah.

â™ª Woo-hoo.

â™ª Oh...yeah.

â™ª Come on boys.

â™ª I want to thank you, for letting me be myself, again.

â™ª I want to thank you, for letting me be myself, again.

â™ª Oh, yeah.

â™ª I want to thank you,
for letting me be myself
again, again.

â™ª I want to thank you,
for letting me be myself...

That was just marvelous.

You know Joey, you are cute.

Well, you're cute too, Don.

Well, I've always thought so.

It's kind of refreshing to find
someone who agrees with me.

I'm kidding. I really don't
take my beauty that seriously.

Well, you should, Don.

I mean, you may not be a big,
blonde, handsome giant,

but you're beautiful
on the inside.

I wonder where I can go
to turn myself inside out.

I wonder if you'd look
the same on the inside?

I think I'll take a look
during the commercial.

You know, behind every marriage,
there's a story.

Tonight we present a moment
of crisis during the courtship

of Lance Rentzel
and Joey Heatherton.

Now listen Joey,
don't worry about a thing.

Everything's going
to be all right.

My father's a real nice guy.

Of course he's very,
very possessive

so I've got to be extremely
careful how I break the news

that we're married.

Well now, you can do
anything you want.

When you come in,
don't let on you're my wife
or even my girlfriend.

I don't know.
Figure out something.

OK?

All right.

Son!

Dad!

Oh, look at you boy!
Come here.

Oh dad, you look good!
Yeah.

You look good son!

Hey you do too, dad,
but you're kind of purple.

That's because you're
cutting of my wind.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Oh, my son how you've grown.
It's just great to see you!

You know, you get to be
almost as big as your dad.

Well, it's good eating dad,
good habits, good habits.

Stand next to me.

I got to admit
you're an inch taller.

Let me look at you boy.
Let me look at you.

You know,
you got my nose.

You got my eyes.

You got my smile

and you've got
your mother's build.

Well, let's sit down.
Yeah.

I've been a good father
to you, haven't I, boy?

Oh, you know you have, dad.
Yeah.

Well, it gets lonely
without you son.

You know, you're all I've had
ever since your mother ran off
with Arthur Treacher.

I guess that's why
I love you so much, son.

I've had to be a mother
to you too.

I know dad. That's why I send
you flowers on Mother's Day.

Yes.

You know, it makes me
nervous though when I
think that someday,

somehow, someone will,
kinda, come between us.

High Lance, old pal!

Who's this?

That's a fraternity
brother of mine.

Oh, I see.

He kissed you!

That's one of our
fraternity handshakes.

Well, I think you better
have a meeting and drop it.

Dad, meet our team
quarterback, Joey Jones.

Oh well,
pleased to meet you, Joey.

Me too, Mr. Rentzel.

You know, Lance, you've
got some soft quarterback.

I guess he's out of training.
You know.

I told him all about you
and I guess he just got
carried away.

Well, that's all right.

I got kind of a warm
feeling there and I'm not
even in the fraternity.

Sit down, fellah.

Lance has told me
what a great dad he has.

Oh well, thank you.

Have you noticed
he's got my eyes?

Yes.
He must have his mother's build.

Yeah.

She was a biggy.

Hey Lance.

He's holding your hand.

I think he just wants to
keep it warm for passing.

Oh yeah.

Well, I'm sorry but I just have
to think that your quarterback

is a little effeminate.

Dad, no Dallas Cowboy's
are effeminate.

Maybe he's a midnight cowboy.

How'd you fellah's ever
got together anyway?

A blind date.

It was a double date actually.

Oh well, that's
very romantic, yeah.

It was very romantic.

Oh say, I see you're married.

Oh yes, that's right, I am.

Well, what's your wife like?

Oh, my wife is blonde
and six foot two.

Six foot two?

In high heels?
No, in cleats.

It's a new fashion dad.
Everybody's wearing them.

Sure. Sure.

Say Mr. Rentzel,
I suppose you realize that
Lance is very attractive

and one of these days,
a girl is going to take
him away.

Yeah, yeah, that's going to
be thought too, my only son.

You're a good friend, wouldn't
you miss him if he got married.

I sure would.

Us guys have
a lot of fun together.

I bet you do.

Look at it this way dad,

if it meant my happiness,
wouldn't you want to see
me get married?

Oh, I suppose if the
right girl came along.

Oh daddy,
I'm so glad you said that.

Lance, I want to hear more
about this fraternity!

Dad, I've just got to tell
you something.

You do like Joey, don't you?

I like Joey, of course.
He's a great guy.

Oh well.

Holy smoke!
It's Joe Namath.

It is Joe Namath.

No dad, this is what I've
been trying to tell you.

This is Joey Heatherton
and she's now my wife.

Your...Your wife!

Dad, dad...how can I say this,

I knew this was
going to be a shock.

You're not angry with me,
are you?

No, but I would've been.

Now I'm just relived
that you married a girl.

Jimmy Durante and Don Knotts!

â™ª Please take your medicine,
dear world.

â™ª Please keep your pressure
down, dear world.

â™ª I promise to strive on
each word your doctor speaks.

â™ª He'll bring the roses
back to your cheeks.

â™ª For you've been a pallid
and blah world

â™ª Stick out your tongue
and say "Ahh," world.

â™ª We'll give you plasma
and tonic, by the spoon.

â™ª So be a dear world,

â™ª - Take your medicine
Dear world

â™ª - Keep your pressure down
Dear world

â™ª And get well soon!

â™ª Please keep your
fever down, dear world.

â™ª Please keep your
courage up, dear world.

â™ª Your vim and vigor
is very sorely missed

â™ª Help us declare you
"Patient dismissed."

â™ª Stand on your
crutches with pride, world.

â™ª You've got to save
your own hide, world.

â™ª We'll bring you lilacs
until you're back in tune

â™ª So be a dear world

â™ª - Keep your fever down
Dear world

â™ª - Keep your pressure down
Dear world

â™ª And get well soon!

Hit it!

â™ª Someone has wounded you,
dear world.

â™ª Someone has poisoned you,
dear world.

â™ª And those who love you
defiantly insist

â™ª That you get right off
that critical list.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

This guy gets me crazy.

Let's go home, Don.

Ok. I'll see you, Jimmy.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

That's just the musical term.
Oh!

Comedians.

â™ª So make your recovery
quick, world.

â™ª We're sick of
having a sick world.

â™ª We want you dancing
tomorrow afternoon,

â™ª So be a dear world

â™ª - Take the stitches out
Dear world

â™ª - Rip the bandage off
Dear world.

â™ª And get...

â™ª Well...

â™ª Soon!

Yeah!

Thank you, folks.

Hey Don.

Comedians.

You know something Don,

I've been looking forward
to working with you like
this for a long time.

Well, you know something Jimmy,

I've always wanted to,

well as they say, share the
spotlight with you too.

You have?

Why?
Huh?

The question was, why?

Well, that's kind of
a funny thing to ask.

I mean, if you don't mind
my saying so Mr. Durante,

I mean, you're a legend
and it's not exactly
everyday in the week

that I get the chance to meet
a real live legend.

Just the other day
I was thinking of myself,

today, you know, here is
another day and no legend.

So today, when I finally
realized, it was my turn--

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Maybe I can help you
un-clarify the situation.

You mean, working with Jimmy has
made all your impossible dreams

and your aspirations
take fruition

and the short space of 24 hours?

Well you said it
better than I could.

That's what makes me a legend,

but tell me, exactly, what
gives you the biggest thrill

about this whole experience?

Well, you've done so many
great things, Jimmy.

I mean, they're just
too numerous to mention.

I'm willing to let you try.

Well, first of all there was
I know what you're going
to say.

My movies,

those unforgettable classics
of the silver screen.

Yeah, that's right.

Like Yankee Doodle Dandy,
The Fighting 69th with
Pat O'Brien--

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

I think you got me confused
with a different Jimmy.

Are you trying to say that
James Cagney's acting style

is so reminiscent of mine,

that makes the public
at some time,

a little confused about the
public knowing that I know...

Take the next line.

You know, you sort of took the
words right out of my mouth.

Well, I wasn't too thrilled with
what you were doing with them.

I'm sure you probably are more
impressed with my songs

than my thespian abilities.

Well, that's true.

I guess after all, who could
forget that great song like

Inca Banca Boca...
Inca Banca Buca,

Well, I can't remember
the whole melody but...

Well, I want to thank you
for taking this legend

and making him an unknown.

I wish I have the ability to
express myself in the clear and
the smooth and the lucid way

that you have of doing it,
Jimmy.

It's easy, Don.

I just open my mouth
and hope for the best.

Of course, it's much easier when
you have something nice to say.

It's time to play the game
that helps you meet your mate.

Passion Impossible

and here's your host,
Sonny Smiles.

Oh, hi!

Hi there!

How are you doing, folks?

We're just warming up our
contestant Ms. Abigail Finchley.

She warms up very well.
Abigail...

Oh, Sonny.

Oh, You.

All right.
Easy, easy does it.

Abigail, do you want to
tell the audience a little
bit about yourself now?

Well, Sonny.

First of all I'm a kindergarten
teacher from Eastern View.

Eastern View let's hear it
for Eastern View, please.

It we could, if we could,
great town Eastern View.

And I was never kissed
until I was twenty three.

Never kissed until
you were twenty three

and then, and then you've...

And then, Geronimo!

Oh yeah, a little bundle
of fun there, aren't we.

Now are you ready to play
Passion Impossible?

Oh, are you kidding?

Now, I wanna point out
that our two bachelors

who are gonna be vying
for your hand tonight

have never met and they
still cannot see each other.

Now, let's meet them right now;
bachelors of the night.

Our first bachelor one of the
world's richest playboys;

he actually owns a
hundred thirty five oil wells,

a fleet of ships, an airline,
three countries

and right now he's
dickering to buy a pair
of bell bottom pants.

I like you to meet
Mr. James D. Wealth.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Our second bachelor is
a former Vice President
of the United States,

a part time cheer leader
for the New York Jets,

and a big game hunter

who just returned from
a hunting expedition
where he killed

twelve lions in the Boston Zoo,

Mr. Donald K. Dangerfield.

I left my jaguar in the
parking lot I hope it
doesn't eat the attendant.

But that's, that's the break
of the passion game.

Now, on with the show.

Well, Abigail now Abigail
you did not hear a think
I said, right?

All right dear, let's play,
let's play dear let's, let's...

Oh, let's play...

Let's play Passion Impossible.

Well okay,
Bachelor number one now,

what would you do if
we were going steady

and my father forbade me
to ever see you again?

Well, I'd tell him
it's not nice to forbid.

Oh.

Especially in mixed company.

Oh, I think I'm in love
with number one.

Oh, but I'll give
number two another chance.

Okay, what if I were captured
by a band of wild savages

and you heard me scream
for help after the third day,

how would you rescue me?

Well, that's easy.

First, I jump into my
private airplane, fly over
where you were held prisoner

parachute down
and smother you with kisses.

Oh!
And what about the savages?

They'll have to wait their turn.

How is that for competition

they gave me Jungle Jim.

Oh, they're fighting over me!

Now, now, fellows.
Lets hold it down now.

Boys, boys
can we, can we take it easy!
Hi, Sonny.

They are, they are fighting
over you no wonder too.

Okay, Abigail now
your time is up

make your decision
for whoever you pick,

the two of you will go
on an all expense paid
two-week vacation

in Wheeling, West Virginia.

Oh, oh, oh!

Including, including
dinner at both restaurants
in Wheeling there.

Oh, oh!

And your chaperone on this
dream trip of a life time--
Who? Who? Who?

--will be none other than
the star of the silver
screen Ernest Borgnine!

Oh!

Ernest Borgnine?

I've seen all his pictures.

I love the way he sings.

This morning I just bought
a wallet with his picture in it.

All right now, what do you say?
What do you say?

Well, I don't know how,
who to pick I want them both!

You want them both?
That means only one thing--
We have a tie!

We have a tie here
on the Passion Game!

Looks like one of us is
gonna spend a lot time
with Ernest Borgnine!

All right now, if you two
fellows will come on down

I'd like you to meet each
other and I'd like you to
meet Abigail Finchley.

Dad!

Son!

What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?

Well never mind about Dad,
what are you doing here?

You're my husband!

You're related?
The two of you?

Well, well he's my husband
and he's my father-in-law and

either one of them has a dime!

Yeah, I had a dime.

I had a dime but you
put it on your name!

Oh!

Who's watching the kids?

How do you like that!

Now I'm never gonna meet
Ernest Borgnine.

That's our show for tonight.

Now, you'll be sure to watch
our other family show

I've Got a Secret Lover.

Goodnight everybody.

You know in a few months the
American Medical Association

will be holding their annual
convention in New York City.

Now each year the association
honors one colleague

whom they feel has contributed
the most to modern medicine.

Now last year the gentleman
they paid tribute to was a
Dr. Harry Hillary.

The discoverer of a new
important medication.

Unfortunately, Dr. Hillary
was taken ill that day

and accepting the award for him
was one of his assistants,

a gentleman who had not made
a speech since high school

probably not even then

and he'd rather be
anywhere else as he hears
himself introduced.

Thank you, thank you
Mr. Chairman and, thank
you Mr. President,

and good evening doctors.

Now, I'm not a speaker

but as you know,
Dr. Hilly Halery, Harry,
Harry Hillary

was supposed to speak tonight
but he couldn't t make it

and believe you me
having to take his place

is really having to fill
a couple of awfully big shoes.

I don't mean to imply that
Dr. Hillary has big feet,

just big shoes.

Anyway, well, gentlemen
our laboratory has finally
come up with it,

a perfect and I say perfect
tranquilizing pill.

I have one over here
it's a small thing I....

and believe you me that the
soothing and the calming

and tranquilizing effects
that we've gotten into this pill

has just been remarkable

and it's different from
the other tranquilizers
on the market.

I mean, it's a real departure.

It's neither Reserpine nor
Meprobamate nor Chlorpromazine;

we call ours simply "Becalm".

"Be calm with Becalm"
there's a slogan for you.

In fact with these pills,
you can have four things.

You can have calmness,
you can have kind of confidence,

you can have happiness,
and the fourth thing,

the fourth thing...ah...

is a good memory.

Being calm of course
has many advantages

that makes you steady of hand,

gives you a better penmanship
and helps you to write better

and in fact
some of you doctors really...

To prove the confidence they
give you we tried it out up
at the state prison there

and let me just read you
a paragraph from a letter
the warden wrote to us.

Okay, I think
I can remember that.

Oh, I can't actually...

Now, this is from the warden.

"After taking one of your pills,

I let our worst men
up out of solitary

and permitted them to throw
a party among themselves.

Head guard Jenkins who had
put these men in solitary

took three of your pills
and attended the party unarmed.

He will be buried on Wednesday."

Of course, the important
thing is he indeed enjoyed
the party.

The most amazing thing about
these pills, however, is that
they have no side effects.

Most of your various pills
as you know they have on the
market today

they have an awful lot of
trouble with various kinds
of side effects.


Well, I seem to be getting
a little cold is there a
doctor in the house?

A little humor there.

As I say there, um, there,
there are no side effects to
these pills

and we don't have to worry
about putting any labels
on the bottles,

you know, causes drowsiness,

do not drive, take, take while
driving things like that.

Anyway, I wish Dr. Hillary
could have been here.

He steered these experiments
on the pill but he couldn't
make it.

They've got him up at
Smile View.

He flipped out actually.

He's on Phenobarbital.

He's on Phenobarbital.

You know,
I never cease to marvel at

the poise and assurance
of the TV weather man

but after all there's really
no pressure on him.

The actual weather report
is compiled by a competent
meteorologist

and passed on to him
to relate to the viewers.

I wonder however how calm
and poised he'd be if
something happened

and he couldn't get through
to the weather bureau.

What's that, Herb?

You can't get through?

Nothing?

We don't have anything?

I'm on air in ten
seconds. You've got to
come up with something.

Well, I'm at--Good evening!

Good evening and welcome
to your 11:10 weather forecast

just as it is every
evening at 11:10 along
about the same time.

The, the present
temperature is, um,

degrees and the wind is
coming from the, um,

the wind is coming from
the window isn't it?

See, it's heated here
in the studio

so we have no way of knowing
what the weather is outside.

Well, we do have ways...

Let's have a look at the map.

Well there it is!
The good old USA.

Of course,
this is Maine right up here

and then way over here
in the west is California,

let's just pencil that in,
California.

There we go.

How about that?

Anything, Herb? Ah-hum.

I was born right in here,
that's West Virginia.

I bet it's really cold
down there now.

It's cold in West Virginia,
huh, Herb?

He doesn't know.

Anyway that reminds me
of a little story

about this guy who said

"I understand you're
doing very well by your
gambling casino"

and his friends said

"Oh, the gambling casino is
just the front and the back
is a candy store."

Of course,
I'm not a comedian or anything.

I like to get my licks
in though.

At least you can do is laugh
it up, huh, Herb?

Speaking of weather
as we are here tonight,

the other day my little
boy was asked by his
teacher to spell weather

and he spelled it
"w-a-n-d-h-e-r" and I thought
that was just about the

worst spell of weather
we've had in a long time.

Oh boy, anyway get me an
old report will you, Herb.

An old one, I don't
care how old, just get
it in here.

Oh, folks a bulletin
just came in.

"Heavy snow falls are expected
in the Valley Forge area,

troops movements have been
ordered by General Washington."

Thank you, Herb...

You're leaving?

Yeah, go ahead and leave,
check to see if it's raining.

You're, you're sticking
huh, Fred?

Good, good old Fred,
Fred's here.

Anyway, we're gonna
pause now folks,

be right back after these words
from our sponsor.

Am I...

Well, it seems we, um,
no longer have a sponsor.

How about that!

Anyway I'll tell you what
the weather's gonna be

it's gonna be...we're gonna
have some low pressure area
here in the East

and, um, even temperatures
in the Midwest

and higher temperature
out in the West. You get
the message NBC?

Does that get through to you?

Affair of the heart?

Mm-hmm.

Me too.

Why did I ever get mixed up
with a man like Harry?

He was no good.
He treated me like dirt.

He insulted me
in front of my friends.

He never danced
with me at parties.

I cooked and slaved for him

and he was completely
insensitive to my needs.

My George was the same way.

George?

He's a brute.
I'm gonna jump.

Oh no, no, no.

Oh, you mustn't be alone
at a time like this.

Oh, I can help you I know I can.

Just come with me
to my apartment.

I'll save you.

Just come with me,
I'll get my car.

It works every time.

Oh, what floor did you want?

Fifteen.

Oh, I'm on the same floor.

Phoenix you'll be crying...

Parum pump um parum
pum pum para ree...

I think this elevator
stopped moving!
Huh?

I think this elevator's stuck!

No, that's impossible.

I've lived in this building all
my life there's never been any--

No, I don't think
we're going anywhere.

This elevator's built
perfectly there never been...

This elevator isn't
moving up or down...

Nothings ever
happened to this elevator...

We're not going anywhere...
It's never stopped...

We're stuck!
This elevator's stuck!

We're stuck in here!
Help somebody help us!

Help!!
Shh.

People could die in
elevators you know!

Would you...
I haven't even traveled...

Would you help, can
you hear me down there?

I've never been to Poland...
I don't wanna die! Get out
of here!

We're stuck!

Now listen,
in a situation like this

it's very important
that we keep our cool

and the way to keep our cool
is to just talk,

just talk about anything
you know, so, so just go
ahead and talk.

Come on talk!
Don't touch me!

You sex maniac!

I know about you guys.

You follow girls on elevators
and you wanna talk

and what do you want
to talk about?

Sex! Ha, ha, ha.

Well, you talk on your side
of the elevator!

At a time like this I think
it becomes necessary

for one to keep a cool head,

review the facts
and plan a course of action.

Now, on every elevator there
is an emergency telephone.

I think the first thing I
should do is to call the
emergency department

and inform them of
our predicament.

However, the phone is on
your side of the elevator.

May I use the phone?

All right.

Cool heads prevail.

We're stuck and we're gonna die!
Get us out of here!

I don't know where we are,
somewhere between fifteen
and stuck--

Oh, you idiot!
Give me--

Hello, could you help me please?

I'm stuck on this elevator
with a possible sex maniac!

Yes, thank you very much.
I'd appreciate it.

Now, they're gonna try
and fix the elevator.

We just have to
stay here and relax.

I'm as clam as a calm.

They're gonna help us?

Just yes, just relax.

Uh-huh.

Well, I guess I'll
miss my party.

Party, what party?

Well I was going to a
birthday party for my friend
Pamela on fif-fifteen

but I guess I'll miss it now.

I was gonna take her
this bottle of scotch.

That's a bottle of scotch?

Uh-huh.

Listen, why don't we just, um,
have a drink maybe?

I don't drink on elevators.

I don't drink on elevators
ordinarily either.

I mean, I don't drink
anywhere but I mean under
the circumstances

I think we should have
a little drink just to
calm you down!

How was it?
Fine.

How do you feel?

I feel warm, ha-ha.

Deliciously warm.

Ha, all over...warm!

Hey, what's your birth sign?

Listen, I bet you're a Taurus,
the bull.

Say listen, I like to talk
to you for a minute.

I really have a tremendous
amount of respect for you
I really do.

I mean I've respected you ever
since we got on this elevator

and I was wondering if it
would be all right if I
cross the line

and came over your side
of the elevator?

Ole Taurus, ole,

Hey, you know what?
You're not Taurus at all
you know what you are?

No.

You're a tiger. Grrrr.

You remind me of someone.

Who?

You know that sexy singer?

Frank Sinatra.

Come on.

Scooby dooby doo.

Hello, room service?

Can you pipe some music
up to the, um, couple on
the stuck elevator?

Ringa-ding-ding.

[Music playing]

May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

You bet your bird.

Do you know something?
Hmm?

I think we should be
very proud of ourselves.

I mean, the way we controlled
ourselves in this emergency.

Yes, we've acted like two mature
people in complete control.

That's right self control.

I really place a lot of
value on self control I
wanna say and I love you!

I love you!

I love you, I love you!
Oh, well have a happy life
together!

Oh, wonderful idea and
house in the country.
Yeah.

And have lots of kids.
Yeah, how many kids?

Oh thirty or forty...
Yeah, that's good...

And music all day long,
music you like music?

Oh, I love it. Yeah.

What kind of music
do you like?
Mozart.

Mozart all day long Mozart,

I love Mozart and
the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.

Oh yeah, I love the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band and I love you.

Tell me you love me.
I just did.

Tell me again.
I love you.

Say I love you forever.
I love you forever.

And a day!
And a day!

Hey!

Huh, what's the matter?

This elevator started moving.

Oh yeah, it has, hasn't it?

Gee, it was really
very nice meeting you.

Oh well, it was very nice
meeting you too.

Good night.

Night.

You know, Maureen, it was really
nice appearing with you again.

Thank you, Don.
it was nice appearing with you.

Thank you.
Okay.

Oh Eddie, it's time to go.

You know Maureen I was
just wondering if you're
not busy tonight

I was wondering if maybe--

Yes?

Well you know, if you're not
doing anything after the show

maybe we could go to a
little restaurant and maybe
have a bite of dinner or,

you know, little wine
candle light, a little
soft music.

Oh, Don, I really like too
but I'm terribly sorry
I have another date.

Oh!

Are you ready, Eddie?
Right, sweetheart.
