''THREE SEASONS''

You must be Kien An.

Yes, l am.

Follow me.

Here are your things.

You are here on recommendations.

l hope you don't let us disappoint.

l will not sir.

We follow strict rules here.

lt is important they are not violated.

Teacher Dao is no forgiving man.

The bell rings early every morning.

The flowers must be picked and
bundled to be sold in the city

Teacher Dao takes pride in his flowers.

Customers take pride in his flowers.

Thus, you must take pride in his flowers.

Try not to think about it.

Don't let the temple distract you.

lt is important to keep busy.

You'll soon forget it there.

lt looks abandoned.

lt is the Teacher's home.
He has not left it in years.

The older women say
his soul left him long ago.

ls this lade what is there
as pretty as a lotus?

Green leaves, white flowers?

Green leaves, white flower,

yellow center.

Yellow center. . .
white flower, green leaves.

lt is near the mud, yet does not smell of mud.

A woman's destiny is like a raindrop.

Some fall in the gutter. . .

some fall in rich ponds.

You buy for me? Chewing gum. . .cigarette?

Hai, l've been waiting all morning.
Did you bring the rubbing oil?

Yes, the arm still bothering you, huh?

lf it's not the arm, then it's the back.

Let me have some of that.

Hai, maybe you can put a stop to this debate.

What now?

You see that hotel there?

What about it?

l was betting Minh here.

The towels used in there must have
some kind of perfume in them.

What is that?

You ever notice the smell?

Everyone we drive from there has a fresh smell.

Like l said, it's the smell of money.

Where there's money there's that smell.

Well, it's a waste of money.

We need to work. . .

. . .a whole month to barely afford. . .

. . .their cheapest room.

Four star, five star. . .

. . .they can't match my thousand star deluxe.

What's your thousand star deluxe?

From my bed, l see a thousand stars.
No roof, just a thousand stars.

At least you have a bed.

Are you still reading that old book?

You sure are persistent.

You haven't fixed that?

lt's gonna get you one day.

Come back here!

l need a ride! Let's go!

That was close.

What happened?

Just watch the street.

Don't ask questions.

Drop me off at the Marqu Hotel.

Damn, my lipstick is all smeared.

They should know better.
l never let anyone take me home.

lt was great to see the look on their faces.

Thanks for the fast legs.

Should l wait?

No, lt'll be a while.

l don't mind.

lt'll be hours. l'll get another ride.

Fresh white lotuses!

Fresh white lotuses!

Fresh white lotuses!

Wait a minute. . .

Splendid, the white lotuses have arrived.

You must be new.

l've not seen you before.

Yes, sir. l started this week.

These are nice flowers your Teacher sells.

May l have a bundle?

Smells wonderful.

So beautiful. . .How much?

5,000.

Thank you.

You again. Why are you here?

l said you didn't have to wait.

l didn't mind.

You're not expecting more money, are you?

l was just making sure you had a ride.

Alright. Take me to District Two.

Tomorrow l'll work the Majestic.

There are wealthier guest there.

They know how to treat a woman.

l'm tired of cheap bastards.

You got a cigarette?

No.

lt's too damn hot for smoking anyway.

l could be in a cool room now if l wanted to.

l'd just have to do nightovers. l don't though.

Sometimes l wish l could
fall asleep on the large bed. . .

. . .and let the air-conditioner run all night
until l want to wake up.

That's what they all do up there.

l could use a drink right now.
l bet you don't drink.

No.

What do you do then?

You don't smoke, you don't drink
. . .what the hell do you do?

Besides waiting for pretty girls.

Damn it! Not another blackout!

The third time this week.

lt's damn hot on a night like this.

What's the problem?

Where are you headed?

Taking her home.

lt's all right. She lives here.

Let them go!

Our block hasn't been safe during blackouts.

Some streets have it worse though.

Stop at the lamppost ahead.

Yellow center, white flower, green leaves.

lt is near the mud, yet does not smell of mud.

A woman's destiny. . .

. .is like a raindrop

Some fall in gutter. . .

. . .some fall in rich ponds.

Can anyone ever know how many stalks.

. . .are in a rice field?

How many bends are in river?
How many layers are in a cloud?

Can anyone sweep the leaves of a forest?

And tell the wind to shake the trees no more.

How many leaves must a silkworm eat. . .

. . .to make a dress of colors from the past.

How much rain must. . .

Don't let them bother you.

For the old women sing the same song.
They've been here so long

they think they own the lake.

l didn't know.

How could you?

Let's get back to work.

Lack of work
makes Mr.Huy look bad to Teacher Dao. . .

. . .thus he punishes severely for it.

After all these years
still can't stand this heat.

You just have to not think about it.

Throw up a bag of nuts for me!

l'm waiting for the day that corner of ours. . . .

. . .is replaced by a hotel.

lt's so crowded, we just have to live with it.

l hope when l'm their age
l'm still not waiting around to give rides.

Tell me something.

You ever notice the American over there?

Just him and his cigarettes. . .

Days?

Days?

He's been there for weeks.
Someone in the hotel told me.

He sits there smoking all day.

He just stares at that restaurant. . .

. . .across from him.

Bet you didn't know that.

that used to be a G. l .A. Bar.

l got stuck driving him around town
last week. We went around. . .

. . .looking fo a young woman in a photo.
l personally think he's nuts.

Let's go back to our corner
and join the guys.

Kien An.

Get dressed.

Teacher Dao would like to see you.

Thank you for coming.

Do not be afraid.

l have a simple request.

Your song from this afternoon. . .

. . .tell me where you learned it?

From my mother.

She sang it to me when l was a child.

l would like you to sing the song.

l don't understand.

You were not brought here to understand.

Your song from this afternoon. . .

l want you to sing it.

Can anyone ever know.

How many bends are in the river?

How many layers are in a monsoon cloud?

Can anyone. . .

. . .sweep the leaves on a forest.

And tell the wind to shake. . .

You buy, you buy?

Stop! Stop!

Hey, Woody!

Pay money!

Pay money!

How much?

Have you seen my box?

Mr. have you seen my box?

l hope. . .

. .my private thoughts. . .

. . .have been entertaining.

l'm sorry. l will leave immediately.

How much of my work did you read?

Enough.

ls that right?

Enough. . .

. . .to know your pain.

What do you know about pain?

l too have had a hard life.

l too have been alone.

. . .to have children point
and mock as you walk down the street?

Or when they see you coming. . .

. . .to have people
close their doors and windows?

ls that why you hide in the shadow?

l am not hiding.

They say
you have not left this temple in years.

More nonsense!

. . .my ears escape these windows
to embrace the songs of the birds.

My nose pierces these walls. . .

. . .and naps in the fragrance of my lotuses.

With every sunrise and sunset. . .

. . .my eyes flutter into the air.

Any my heart. . .

My heart has transcended

. . .above the bondage of man.

Until you have travelled far,

Do not come back here.

On fully flapping wings fly l.

Chasing chubby, Lazy clouds across the sky.

And herding evening breezes
through plains and meadows.

To visit the Seas my fluttering sails l see.

Brother to the Marlin together in the night.

Pucking at the moon her reflection in waves.

l raise my bardly which on the rising tides.

Oh rise, gentle sun, golden in your reach.

And weave, dear Moon, your silvery filament.

Unveil away the darkness that over me hangs. . .

One this funered cloth my they, my Preshiment.

Upon a lake a lotus wish l be.

Scenting the day's breath
with fragrance and poetry.

Searching in the wind
for traces of my formed spirit. . .

The discovery my reflected present

Can l see. . .

that was the last poem l wrote.

Before l lost my fingers.

You may leave now.

l will lend you my fingers.

You do not want to be bothered
with a bitter man's thoughts.

l would not be here if it was bother.

You should leave. .

. . .before others begin to worry.

Wait.

Maybe.

. . .we could start tomorrow.

We shall start tomorrow.

Have you shined any shoes
for an American with a wooden case?

l haven't shined one shoe in this rain.

You're not following me, are you?

You said you would start working here.

Yeah, so what?

That didn't mean for you to be here.

Did you wait in front all night?

l just thought you might want a ride.

There aren't too many safe cyclos at this hour.

Yeah, well how do l know you're one of them?

Pull over right here.

This is for you.

Please, l can't take it.

Take it.

l'm usually not so generous.

What are you doing?

lt's too hot to sleep indoors.

You're crazy.

l'd trade places with you anytime.

So pale was the moonlight. . .

. . .it could not shroud the pallid lake.

Yet l found joy. . .

. . .admist searing pair.

to write these words.

. . .is like striking a note.

Plucking a chord. . .

. .vibrating a stream of light.

lt's melody echoes from my forlorn heart.

Did you get all that?

Yes, l have it all.

Good.

That will be enough for now.

l could go on further.

Unfortunately, l cannot.

l am out of words for now.

Do you ever plan on leaving this place?

l sometimes have this dream. . .

l dream my fingers have grown back.

. . .and the swelling on my face has subsided.

l dream that l have with me. . .

. . .a dozen baskets of my best white lotuses.

. . .and travel to the floating market of youth.

As l approach the women. . .

l would free all of my lotuses into the water. . .

. . .and watch them float through the market
like a white river.

lt would be then,
that l had finally returned home. . .

. . .set free and pure.

Then l would wake up into the black night

. . .and realize it was simply a dream. . .

. . .one of many that will never be fulfilled.

lt's not too late.

lt is late.

lt is later than you realize.

Don't come back until you find it.

Have you heard?
The cyclo race is on after all.

Who's my challenger this year?

You know Khoi over there?

ls he the one to beat?

Not only is he entering,
but he's betting he'll beat you.

And you, are you entering?

l don't think so.

You'll think l'm crazy. . .

What did you say?

l said l really enjoy the heat.

To most people it's unbearable.

l remember going to school
and wearing a white Ao Dai.

. . .and near our school
were rows of Phuong Vi trees. . .

. . .with red flowers that blossom
during the warm months.

All the girls would put them in their hair. . .

But if we were lucky,
a boy would give them to us.

And we would dry them as bookmarks.

So we wouldn't forget the boy.

You must have gotten a lot of flowers.

Miss. . .How much do you charge?

Charge for what?

. . .and evening with you.

Fifty dollars.

But as you know l don't do overnights.

Why? You have some new clients for me?

No. Curious, that's all.

Hey, don't think
l'm going to be doing this forever.

l have plans you know.

There are other ways to make money.

Yeah, Like what?

Like my mother. . .

. . .who died breaking her back for her family.

What did she get out of it?

That's not going to happen to me.

Have you been in one of those hotels?

No.

lt's a different world in there.

They are not like us.

They have a different walk, a different talk.

The sun rises for people like them. Not us.

We live in their shadows. . .

. . .and it grows bigger with each new hotel built.

Next time pay close attention. . .

. . .to who comes through those front glass doors.

How many do you see like yourself?

One day l will remain in that world.

. . .to become one of them.

l'm not sure that's the solution.

Yeah, what do you suggest,
marry a cyclo driver?

Here are your flowers.

Thank you.

Could l have some flowers?

You are selling, aren't you?

Yes l figured you want the. . .

Plastic lotuses?

l want no part of it.

They're popular.
l've had trouble selling my flowers all day.

l've yet to sell one.

People have been giving in to their convenience.

And they won't wilt or die.

They even spray the flowers
to make them smell real. . .

These days. . .

. .that seems to be the trend for everything.

Give me a couple.

How much?

Thank you.

ls that you Woody?

l'm being chased.

Quick, get on.

Causing trouble again?

lt was stolen.

Have you given any rides
to an American with a case like mine?

l haven't seen anyone with a case like yours.

And in this rain it's hard to see anything.

Stay out of trouble Woody.

l'll find you if l see him. Go on.

Watchout for the motorbikes.

Don't disturb my restaurant again!

l'm sorry.

Teacher Dao has
terminated your meetings with him as of today.

Mr. Huy, is something wrong?

. . .for you to write.

How is that possible?

We just started writing.
He can't be out of poems.

lt is not for me to question the teacher.

Could l speak to him?

lf you just let me talk to him. . .

l'm sorry but his request is clear.

Enough.
l recommend you return to the sleeping hall.

ls everything okay?

Are you all right?

Please l have to go now.

Where's my case? You took my case.

Beat it! Quit bothering the customers!

No problem, tell me what he say.

What happened?

He say you make him offer
then up and left with his case.

You see. He says he didn't take anything. . .

l want you to leave...and don't come back here!

l'm glad you could make it.

That's what Binh said last year. . .

. . .right before l beat him.

Brothers and sisters. . .

. . .are you ready for the cyclo race?

Riders, are you ready?

On your mark. Get set. . . Go!

Look, l no longer need a ride from you.

lt's better for both on us.

ls something wrong?

l just won't be needing. . .

. . .a ride anymore, all right?

Did you see me race today?

No.

l won.

Congratulations.

l'll follow you home.

l have 50 dollars.

Should we get started now?

What is this all about?

Open it.

Wait. . .

l want you to put it on without your make-up

Look, what does it matter?

Please, l've already bought this for you.

Walk back and forth for me.

l want you to sleep.

l just want to watch you sleep.

How much?

5,000 dongs.

Hello.

What are you doing here?

l've. . . l've been waiting at the Hotel
but you haven't been around.

Didn't l tell you. . .

l no longer need a ride from you.

Besides, l don't work there anymore,

Please leave.

What do you want from me?

l did what you asked.
Why can't you leave me alone?

l want to spend another night with you.

l'll pay you again.

Wait here.

Here, take it. l don't want your money.

l don't deserve it.

We didn't make love.

So you owe me nothing.

You have given me more than you know.

What are you trying to do to me.

Why me.

Have you forgetten l've been. . .

. . .with many men?

Not with you the way l have.

Open your eyes Hai.

l am a whore. . .

. . .and you were just a cyclo driver.

That's all.

Nothing more.

Please don't make me feel
what l'm not capable of.

lt's alright. Let her in.

Why?

There was no need for you to know

Why now, when you have fought so long?

Do your words mean nothing to you?

l have hidden from Death long enough

. . .to welcome it. . .

. . .as my final guest.

Do you know why. . .

. . .the first night you were here?

The song you sang
in the lake that afternoon. . .

. . .had crossed my ear before

. . .of the women
of the floating market of my childhood.

l had forgotten. . .

. . .my youth.

The only time. . .

. . . l was pure and whole. . .

. . .your song.

l would like you to sing. . .

. . .that song one last time.

Can anyone ever know?

How many bends are in a river?

How many layers are a cloud?

Can anyone sweep the leaves of a forest?

. . .to shake the tree no more?

How many leaves must the silkworm eat. . .

. . .to make a dress of colors form the past?

How much rain must fall from the sky. . .

. . .before the ocean overflows with tears.

How many years must the moon. . .
ln the middle of the night,

the moon comes and waits nearby. . .

He who can steal my heart. . .

l will forever sing joyful songs.

Hey Woody!

Come join us!

Are you in?  Yeah, l'm in.

Woody! What's taking so long?

He will see you now.

Thank you for coming.

Please have a seat.

Thank you, sir.

He wanted you to have this.

The teacher was a handsome man.

When the leprosy spread to his face. . .

. . .it devastated him.

He blamed himself. . .

. . .and lived a life of self-punishment.

The photo was taken on his 23rd birthday.

Six months later he sent to his campus

The photo has remained hidden until now.

His words will not fall on deaf ears.

lf there is anything I can do for you. . .

. . .do not hesitate to present your request.

There is one thing.

You don't have to pretend any more.
