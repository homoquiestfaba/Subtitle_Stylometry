One day I woke up
a stiff, slow old man.

Now, I'm just sitting here
day-after-day getting old,

and the older I get,

the faster life goes by.

No matter what I try
to do to slow it down,

it just keeps going faster.

What have I done?

Did I do anything,

anything anyone will remember?

Anything good?

Do you have any cigarettes?

This has to stop.

Sarah.

This has to stop.

If Tom knew what was going on

I don't even want
to think about it.

I don't love him, Bill.

So get a divorce.

Is your nose bleeding again?

It's fine.

Weather changing or something.

Hey, hey Bill!
Are you in there?

Bill, it's me, Tom.
Are you in there?

Do you mind opening the door?

Open the door please!

Hey, Bill! Did I wake you up?

No, I just spilled some
coffee on myself.

Come on! Really?

Oh well, do you happen
to drop the rent last week?

Yeah, I think so, you didn't get it?

No, I didn't.

You dropped it with Sarah, didn't you?

You give it to her and you might
as well not give it at all.

I'm sorry about that, Tom.
It won't happen again.

Come on! No big deal!

I think she's just forgetful
with the checks, right?

Hey, I never got a chance
to properly thank you

for helping me out with
the rent the last few months.

It's been a tough time
and I really appreciate it.

Sure, no problem, Bill.

So go ahead and check with Sarah.

If she doesn't have the check,

come on back and
I will give you some cash.

All right, Bill. I'll talk to you later.

See you then!

Take care!

Bye!

Fuck!

Bill, what you think I didn't
know where you lived?

You guys just scared the shit out of me.

I thought you were my fucking landlord.

Get in here, close the door.

This is Barry Warner.
He works with me at the DCPI.

Barry, this guy is a real
spit and polish asshole.

You do what he says and
you won't end up like me.

You guys want some of this?

No, thanks Bill!

Something to drink, maybe?

No, we're good.

Barry, wait outside for me.

You really did scare the shit out of me.

Yeah, well you take my phone calls

I wouldn't barge in on you like that.

-It's good to see you.
-Right.

The old man sent me down here, Bill.

Yeah, I saw him on
the news the other day

Nothing is for certain
but we are very optimistic.

You're working for Lord now.

When I was in the Mayor's detail

I had a few special projects with Lord.

Well, nothing quite like
the work you used to do.

The Pharma task force I got
that pushed through last year,

so, I'm one of his go-to guys now.

You're on his payroll Gunther?

I'm on the city's payroll, Bill.

I'm just doing my part
trying to make a difference.

Also there is a possible promotion.

Of course!

Press Secretary.

That's incredible Gunther.
Congratulations!

Nothing is for certain like I said,

So what, he sent you down
here to assassinate me?

He's got a job for you, Bill.

He wants to put you back to work,

and it's a personal matter.

Yeah, he wants to sit
and talk to you face-to-face

and I think it would be good for you.

Gunther, all due respect,

but I don't give a shit about
the old man's personal problems

I don't know what happened
between the two of you

and I don't want to know,
to be honest with you,

So the least you could
do is go over there

and have a conversation with him.

What do you say, Bill?

I don't know. I'll think about it.

What are you doing
for work these days?

I'm guessing that's not because
you're banging his wife.

It's none of your goddamn business.

This job, Bill, it pays really good money.

Really good money, it could
get you out of the house,

by the looks of it, you could really use it.

Listen, Gunther,

we've known each other a long time,

you are a good guy

and I want you to stay a good guy.

Those things they say I did,

those things I lost my badge
over was for real crimes,

I did them.

I was a young guy, I wanted
to impress the big boss hog

And look where I end up...

no badge, no pension.

I'm fucking broke,

one goddamn DUI away
from a 20-year lockdown.

I broke the law
for that son of a bitch

and I got my fucking
ass handed to me

so if you will excuse me
if I'm not interested

but I'm not.

I'm sorry, Bill.

I understand

but if you change
your mind, give me a call.

I'll have a car sent for you,
we'll take care of everything.

Okay, Bill. I'll see you.

See you, Gunther.

I have imagined explaining
myself to you so many times,

so many different ways.

Arguments, counter-arguments,
speeches about justice

and the greater good

and how I thought of you as a son.

Now that you are
standing in front of me,

nothing seems to make any sense.

I know my saying this
means nothing to you,

my hope is that at
some point in your life

perhaps when you're my age

and not as angry about the things

that have been done to you,

you'll look back on
my words, and if not,

understand them, at least believe.

My sincere regret; I'm sorry, Bill.

I'm sorry for what
has happened to you.

I'm sorry for not backing
you up the way I could have.

I'm sorry for freezing
you out the way I did

when our initiative
began to cave in on us.

And I'm going to make it up
to you in some way or another

whether or not you accept
my proposal here today.

Over the past two years
I've had a lot of time

to reflect over my choices,

good choices, bad choices,

choices concerning you as well
as other choices in my life.

I would like to start correcting
some of these wrongs.

It's quite a change
of heart, Councilman.

Forgive me if I'm a little dubious.

My life is pretty much over, Bill.

You've got a long way to go, John.

Yeah, I probably do but I can see it,

and it's a beautiful thing
what life looks like

when you can see
the end in the distance.

You've got a long way to go.

Here's a little token,

consolation for all the things
that have happened to you.

$200,000.

What's this about, John?

Hey!

Sir!

What are you doing?

You know who you
represent whenever you sit

on the Councilman's
furniture like that?

I went to the head,
I lost track of you, sir.

If we weren't in the
Councilman's house right now,

and smash it against
your fat fucking skull.

Detective first grade and you're
already sitting down the job.

You want to be back in the
bull pen running errands?

No, I do not, sir.

You're by my side at all times.

I understand, sir.

You don't sit, you don't squat,

you don't switch off unless I say.

If I catch you playing
with that kids' toy again,

this detail is going to be
the least of your problems.

You understand?

My daughter, Jessica.

I thought you and Jean couldn't ...

She's not Jean's.

Jessica's mother was a
court reporter downtown.

I know ridiculous, one of the many

but now clich√©s of
my secret sordid life.

When I found out
she was pregnant,

I paid her to keep it quiet,
I paid her to have an abortion.

Needless to say, she
didn't have the abortion.

After a while I lost touch
with her on purpose of course.

I was making a name
for myself in politics

and my financials were
being scrutinized in a way

that I couldn't control,

I found out that Alexandria had died.

A hit-and-run in Queens.

Goddamn animals!

I reached out to Jessica

but she would have
nothing to do with me.

She hates me, Bill.

She hates me.

I'm sorry to hear that.

I recently got word
that she's filed a complaint

with the 88th precinct
in Brooklyn, a nuisance stalker.

As you know, the police
department can't do very much

about things like that.

I would like you to go down
there and see what you can do.

Obviously I'll pay you
a good rate, a day rate,

2500 plus expenses.

If she doesn't cooperate,

if she tells you to go,

just go.

So Jessica is a dancer
at the Confessional,

I told the old man she was
a cocktail waitress there.

And the peeping
Tom isn't just peeping.

Some strange phone calls,

some letters made
from newspaper clippings,

and lately he's been leaving
used condoms in her doorway,

in the mailbox and
window wherever they fit.

Lovely.

You've got plenty in
there to get you started

and here's some
walking around money,

and if you need anything
else just get in touch.

Barry is going to
take you back to town.

Mr. Ivers, I just wanted to say
about the Interborough case.

I don't want to talk about that.

I just wanted to say,
despite how they treated you,

I respect what you did.

I didn't do anything worth respecting.

You color outside the lines,
sometimes it works out,

sometimes you get fucked.

He is a wreck, but he is a good guy,

no matter what happened
between the two of you,

Did you give Ivers all
of Jessica's information?

Yes sir, I did.

Thank you, Gunther.

That would be all.

Hello! This is Tom.

Leave me a brief message
and I will call you later.

Hi Tom! It's Bill.

I just wanted to let you know that

I had a settlement
that was coming to me,

so I'm leaving the money
that I owe you in your mailbox.

that I'll be moving out
of the apartment shortly

probably some time this month.

So you can go ahead

and keep my deposits since
I'm not giving you much notice

and good luck with your next tenant.

It was great, honey. Okay.

Okay.

Bye! Thank you!

I look forward to seeing you again.

Hello there!

You found us.

Uh, I'm here  to see Jessica?

You're new here, aren't you?

As a matter of fact I am.

It will be five to see Jessica.

Come with me.

Tell me your secret.

Tell me your what?

Tell me your secret.

This is uh-huh..

Tell me your secret.

I've been sleeping
with my landlord's wife,

but I'm moving soon.

Come in.

Oh, I'm sorry but you're
not allowed back here.

You filed a complaint
with the 88th precinct.

Oh, yeah. Who are you
working with on it?

Actually, I'm not working
with the police anymore.

I'm retired.

You know what, you can tell
my Dad, I said, no thanks,

and he can go fuck himself.

That didn't take long.

I wish he would
just fucking die.

He paid me to come down here
and run off your pervert.

I'm not interested.

but you should know the NYPD
can't do shit for you,

even if they had the resources
to get the job done

which they don't, their
mandate is strictly reactive

in cases like this.

Is that cop talk for lousy?

It means they'll do a
great job on your rape kit.

What the hell is this?

He's a private investigator,
he's here about the stalker.

How are we supposed to afford
a private investigator?

We're not.

Listen, I need the
money, they came early.

Could you get
them out of here?

This is where I work.

I will.

So you want to do this alone then?

Yes.

Okay.

In case you change your mind.

Good luck with your stalker.

Gunther, it's Bill.

Sorry man!
It's not going to work out.

She saw right through me.

She doesn't want anything
to do with the old man.

I can't say I blame her.

Give me a call back if you will.

Hello Bill!

I figured I'd stop
in and say goodbye

since you are moving.

Sarah! No!

No! You need to get
the fuck out of here

before that husband
of yours comes down here

and cuts my head off.

Bill, stop being
such a drama queen.

So where are you moving?

Away.

You don't want to tell me?

No, I do not.

You know what I think,

I think you're going
to miss me when you leave.

You're probably right.

So if you know you're
going to miss me,

why don't you take me with you?

Oh, my God!

Hi! My name is Jamie
and I'm an alcoholic.

Hi Jamie!

I've been sober for 46 days,
12 hours and 54 minutes.

Thank you!

that's exactly the last
time I had a drink.

Because I love you, you stupid bitch.

no matter what kind of shit
you pull I will not quit you.

Doesn't that mean anything to you?

Jesus Christ!

You're impossible!

You know what, Maybe
I should put your head

through the fucking wall.

Oh, yeah. Why don't you?

Don't test me.

I don't smoke.

Good.

I miss it, I miss it a lot.

I haven't been to
a meeting for a while

but I almost relapsed last
night so that's why I'm here.

I had a fight with my mother
and that always triggers.

She doesn't understand
why I'm sober.

She didn't realize I had a problem

none of my friends did either.

I was really, really
good at hiding it.

Hey Bill!

What will it be?

The same, give me
something terrible.

How are you doing today?

No complaints?

Yeah, none at all.

It's been very difficult for me.

I've been sober for about
five months and six days now

and I'm just

thank you.

I'm just grateful that I have
my family and God

and the support group to
help me get through this.

So let me get out of here.

Any interest in coming along?

Bill!

Hopefully with the help
of my support group,

my friends and my family

I can finally rid myself
of this insidious disease

and try to live a normal life

so I can be there for my family

and my children

and also when my children
have children

they can look at their grandfather

and be proud of what he has

and what he's become

and I would just like to

thank you for inviting me here

and hopefully I can
be clean and sober

and we could all live a great life.

Thank you!

You're looking a little
raw this evening.

My money is still green.

Come on!

Tell me your secret.

I'm dying.

It's been 2 years and 27 days
since I've had a drink.

Most of you know me
and know my story.

I'm just trying to take
it one day at a time,

stay clean, stay upright.

It's tough but I'm here
to tell you it's worth it.

A lot of people will sit here
and they'll tell you about

all the bad things
that drinking made them do

and it's true.

It's going to take your life away

and take everything
that you love away.

But getting clean, getting
clean is the greatest thing

that ever happened to
me in my life, bar none.

Everyday that I spend clean
I thank God for the chance

to live a good life, a clean life,

but I don't want to
focus on the weakness,

I want to focus on the strength

because it takes a hell of a lot
of strength to beat this thing.

Everyday it takes strength,
it's a force of will.

You've got to visualize your
life the way you want it to be,

visualize yourself as the man or
woman that you want to become,

self-actualization,

to become one's true potential

and that's a beautiful thing.

And anyone of you can do it,

anyone can do it.

Huh!

It just takes strength.

And you've got to hold yourself
to that higher standard.

Thank you!

Hello!

Hello!

Jessica.

There's no damage on the locks.

I don't see how he got in here
without climbing over you guys.

How can he just come
in here and do that

Yeah, did you go to
bed drunk or high?

All right, so who else
got keys to this place?

The landlady but she
is as big as a house.

How about you sport,
did you give out any keys?

What the fuck that's
supposed to mean?

Let me put it in a different way.

Any of your dirt bag friends

have keys to your girlfriend's pad?

-What?
-Don't talk to me like that.

I know what she does.

But what exactly is
that you do, Duane?

I am a real estate broker, asshole.

What the fuck do you think you are?

to solve your girlfriend's
problems, Einstein?

So how about you drop the attitude

Why don't you just
get the fuck out of here?

We've lived here
together for five years

We changed the locks the
month after we moved in.

Nobody has keys,
not even the landlady.

All right, well, change
those locks again.

Where is this, gift?

We tried not to touch
anything since we found it.

All right, I'll check it out.

We got the first note
about three months ago.

First, he was just calling
and breathing over the phone.

Then he started leaving
things in the mailbox,

really gross things.

There is no pattern,
sometimes it's every night,

sometimes it's once a week.

Did the detective at the 88th
take any evidence from you?

You mean the dirty
condoms and panties?

No, they told me
to throw them away.

I did keep some of the letters though,

I thought it will be dumb
to get rid of them.

This is a cash business, Mr. Ivers.

No ledgers, no names, no cameras.

What about security?

We've never had any need.

Right, well, I'm going
to have to start

I'm sorry, but that's
out of the question.

That would be a total breach of trust.

Jessica talked to you about this, right?

You know this guy broke into her place.

We don't know if it
was one of her clients.

I'll be very discreet, okay?

I'd just be hanging
around just a barfly.

I'm sorry but I can't allow it.

How much is this going to cost?

This is a matter of principle, Mr. Ivers.

It sounds like about 250 a night.

I would never betray my
clientele for such a..

500?

1,000.

Well, I'm not made of money
so we'll call it seven

and drinks are on the house.

You observe only and you
do so surreptitiously.

No interrogating or
intimidating my customers.

I don't like police, or police tactics.

Well, lucky for you, I'm not one.

And he pays for his own drinks.

Look, if you're going to help me

I have a few conditions.

First, nobody in my life
knows about my father,

especially not Duane.

I need it to stay that way.

Second, I don't want you involved

in my personal business.

Just deal with the
weirdo and that's it.

I don't need a life coach.

Good!

The last thing is, I'm
probably fucking stupid

for even thinking
that you'll honor this

but I don't want you talking
about me to my father.

Yeah.

Are you okay, baby?

Yeah.

So I got prints off this stuff.

See what you can match it to.

Sick fuck broke in her
place while she was sleeping.

How's she doing?

And I've got to hand it to
her, the girl's all business.

-And how you're doing?
-I'm fine.

What's up with the shiner, Bill?

It's none of your business.

So how long is it going
to be to get some results

back on this stuff?

A couple of weeks.

-All right.
-Okay.

Keep me posted.

I will.

This is Bill Ivers, leave a message

at the sound of the tone.

Hi Bill! This is Tom.

I've been calling you the whole day.

I would like to talk with
you about your moving.

You know where to find me, let's
talk about you moving, okay?

I'll wait for your answer.

Thanks! Bye!

How many more nights do you
plan on haunting my bar?

I'll keep you posted.

Well, this can't go on forever.

What do you care,
you're getting paid.

I told you, Mr. Ivers, this
business is based on trust.

Your presence here is
a breach of that trust.

I can see you're all
broken up about it.

I resent that.

Just because I work in
alternative entertainment

doesn't mean I lack integrity.

All right, you know, just save it, okay?

I'm not here because it's fun for me.

Piece of shit isn't just jerking
off in her mailbox anymore.

Are you implying that I don't
care about Jessica's welfare?

No. As far as I can see

you're making a goddamn
fortune off of her,

which is why you have every reason

to be concerned about her welfare

so why don't you just get
the fuck off of my back

and let's get the shit over with?

You've got till the end of the week.

Thanks for your help.

Uh-huh.

I don't need a new deadline.

I need you to meet me at the mark.

Tell Yates not to worry
I'll be there soon.

No, I don't need to --

just tell Yates I'll be there soon.

Bye!

Duane?

That call, that I hear you mention Yates?

What call?

Duane, Yates?

That's who you owe money to?

Hey, I'm not fucking around.

Duane, if you own money to
Yates and you don't pay,

I know that guy, he will
put you in the ground.

Listen to me.

One, take your hands off.

Two, it's none of your business.

Three, I can handle Yates' guys
I've been doing it for years.

Duane, you don't know
what you're dealing with.

Just get rid of that stalker
and get out of our lives.

He's given me some evidence
and I'm having it analyzed.

What kind of evidence?

Some letters from the suspect.

Are they telling?

Sir?

The letters to my daughter?

Barry, would you wait
outside for a second?

Sir, I thought I was heading
up this investigation?

Look, I know what I said, Gunther.

Tell me what's in the letters?

Some crude remarks about her
appearance and lifestyle, sir,

and that he is watching her.

I'd like to see those letters, Gunther.

I'll have them photocopied and
brought to you this afternoon.

Look, I don't mean to gum up
your work, Gunther,

but I'd like appraisals of her situation

on an as-available basis

and I prefer not to have
to ask you for details.

Absolutely, sir, sorry.

You wouldn't keep anything
from me, would you, Gunther?

No sir, I would not.

The stripper at the club
she is his daughter.

Set up a meeting with Yates.

No details. Just set up a meeting.

I'll be available.

Hey!

Let's go get some lunch.

Hey!

Hey!

How did everything go last night?

All clear.

I got these for you guys.

Thank you!

Nothing for you?

No, I'm heading home.

I'm going to get some sleep.

Does it get boring
standing around out here?

I hope it's not weird having
me out of here all night.

I think it's weird for Duane,
but it helps me sleep better.

Honestly, I just want this to be over.

It will be soon, I promise.

You promise, really?

I do.

Well, I'm going to hold you to that.

Go right ahead.

Got a wife waiting up for you?

No.

I had you pegged as a family man?

I don't think anybody has
ever said that to me before.

What gave you that idea?

I don't know, all the little
phrases calling Duane, Einstein,

kind of reminded me
of those dads on TV.

How about you guys, how
long have you been together?

A long time, almost eight years.

That is a long time.

Yeah, tell me about it.

How long has Duane
owed money to Yates?

He's not some street punk, Jessica.

You stay out of this.

I know that boyfriend of yours
is going to get himself killed.

Stay out of it!

So have you found a new place yet?

I haven't even had a chance
to start looking yet.

This gig's really taking it out of me.

You know what?

I think this is our first date.

You know, I have to say,

I'm glad, we might not
be losing you so soon.

Sarah, you are losing me for good.

You're breaking my
heart, you know that?

After this job is over I'm going away.

How long?

I won't be back, Sarah.

You know what's funny?

I thought you are going
to ask me to marry you.

Excuse me!

Hello!

No, not right now.

I'll be staking out
the apartment tonight,

just trying to be there around nine.

The fucking buyers has walked
out of the goddamn closing,

I don't have a shit for them
and it's fucking Thursday.

Why didn't you tell me
you were short this month?

The fuck do you want
me to do, Jessica?

They're right outside.

I'm calling the police.

Yates owns the fucking police.

What are you doing?

I'm doing what I have to do.

Where did you get that?

I got it for emergencies.

Howdy, boys?

Listen, if I don't go out there
they're going to come in here,

and then that's going
to be a big fucking mess.

Duane, what are you doing?

The fuck is he doing here?

Give me that goddamn gun right now.

I'm just going to go out there
and explain the situation.

That's not how it's going to go down.

You don't know anything about us.

You think you know what's
going on here but you don't.

Whatever the situation is
with these guys outside

stays between us, all right?

So do I have your
permission to help or not?

Yes.

Just stand over here, please!

Whoa, whoa, listen,
I've got this under control.

Ah!

Ow, motherfucker, that hurt!

Put some ice on it.

If you don't see me again

and the cops come
knocking for any reason,

and you've never seen any
of these people in your life

including me.

You got it?

Uh-huh.

How much do you owe
these cocksuckers?

32 grand.

As of tomorrow Yates is no
longer a problem for you.

You're paying them off?

I'll let you explain it.

So I understand these
kids owe you some money.

I'm the guy that just
bought Duane's debt.

So why don't you guys come
around the corner with me,

Nah, we ain't going anywhere, man!

I don't think Mr. Yates
would be too happy

about you guys turning
down a full pay out.

So come on, in my car, get your bread,

and get this thing over with.

I need you to get your
fucking ass over here.

I'm going to be in the
alley behind the building.

I need your help.

Thank you for waiting, gentlemen,

I got your money here
32,000, payment in full.

32,000?

What's he up to now, 45 grand?

47k with a convenience fee.

It's a pretty substantial
convenience fee.

Yes, it is.

Which one of you is Wilma?

I'm Wilma.

So you must be Mac.
Listen, man!

I'm done playing games with
you so you either you pay up

or we head on to Duane's place.

Only this time we don't wait outside.

All right, first of all,
you guys go fuck yourself.

32 is what's left on the
marker, 32 is what you get.

Second, I give you this money

and you don't bother
these kids anymore.

There's no point you camping on
in front of this place anyway.

These kids are long gone.

So why don't you just take
this money and pack it in.

This is bullshit.

Bill, what's going on?

Gunther, you made it.

Honestly Bill I don't
even know where to start.

What the hell is going on with you?

I got my ass kicked by a couple
of Brooklyn tomato gang.

I'm not talking about that, Bill.

I'm talking about you.
I'm talking about your life.

I'm talking about who you used
to be and who you are now.

Jesus Christ!

No, you need to hear this.

of the New York City Police Department.

Getting drunk on stale wine
and eating shit off the floor.

I don't remember the
last time I've seen you

without a bruise on your face.

What the fuck happened to you, man?

Why the fuck did you just give up?

You know what your problem is?

What's my problem, Gunther?

You lack self-actualization.

You have the intelligence,
you have the ability,

you have the means,

but you just can't make it happen.

Okay.

Honestly, I'm worried about you.

I'm worried about your
future on this planet.

Anybody else here?

Eh, uh!

Come on.

Lovely.

Benny Reardon.

That's a good pervert name.

What are you doing?
You going  kill me?

Shut up!

Hey! I've got an idea,
I need you to run.

Yeah, give me two minutes
to get to the car.

All right.

Can you wipe my face, please?

Okay, shoot.

All right.

Benny Reardon, white
male, New York 198 7628.

Yeah, I got him.

It looks like he's clean-ish.

He's got a minor domestic
assault charge from ages ago,

a couple of tickets for public toilet.

It looks like he was
institutionalized

for a couple of years.

He is on disability.

What did he do?

Do you want me to send a car over?

No, I'll call you back in a minute.

Benny, right?

Yeah.

My name is Bill.

Why did you hit me with the door?

I'm sorry about that, I thought
you might be dangerous.

No, you hit me in the head with a door.

All right, all right. Just, just relax.

So that house you
went through tonight,

you know who lives in that house?

What house?

Benny, I saw you there, all right?

Do you know who lives there or not?

A pretty girl lives there.

That's right.

You know what day of
the week it is, Benny?

Ah, Monday.

Wait, wait.

What is it, Thursday?

Remember what you had
for dinner last night?

How old are you, Benny?

Ah, 29.

Have you got any parents or relatives

who could help take care of you?

My mom is dead and I don't have dad.

Must gets lonely for you around here.

Loneliness makes people
do strange things sometimes.

I saw her on the subway.

She was just so beautiful.

Have you ever seen
anyone more beautiful?

No.

I just wanted to show
her how special she was.

You know, get something
really special for her.

But I'm kind of shy.

I hope I didn't scare her.

Oh, my god, did I scare her?

I'm always scaring people.

Maybe I could go and
tell her that I'm sorry.

Maybe that would help.

Hey! I want you to listen to me.

You are not to go to that house again.

You don't walk down that street.

When you see that girl coming
you walk in the other direction,

you got me?

Okay.

It's for the best, Benny.

I'm going to be watching.

Okay.

Sorry.

Goodnight, Benny.

Hey, I met our friend last night

and I had a talk with him.

I don't think you'd
be seeing him again.

Why? Did you kill him or something?

No, Duane.

Who was he? Do we get to know?

His name is Benny Reardon.

You know him?

I didn't think so.

He's just a confused kid,
didn't know any better.

You make him sound
like he's a lost puppy

who breaks into our place
and jerks off in our bathroom.

Actually, I don't know how
he got in here clean like that.

He's got a bad leg, he
doesn't move around so good,

I don't see him defeating
your lock either.

He's not exactly the
manual dexterity type.

Are you sure he is the right guy?

I caught him right outside your
place with one of his gifts.

Yeah, that kind.

Listen, if something
does happen again

he is on our radar now,

we can do something about it quickly.

But I honestly don't think
you can have anymore problems

Well, thank you, thank you
for taking care of this.

You're welcome!

I'm glad I could come through for you.

It's going to be awhile before you..

Just don't.

Please leave now!

All right.

Jessica, I know you don't want
to hear this right now,

but it's time you started
thinking long and hard

about that guy you're with.

I know you love him and
you think he loves you,

but the way he put you in
danger the other night

it could've been a death
sentence for the both of you.

Have you ever heard of
someone named Conrad Barnes?

The pimp?

I'm only going to tell you this
because I believe you will honor

our agreement that you not
inform on me to my father.

Okay.

I had already left home
before my mother died

that she shipped me off
to I got in with Conrad Barnes.

Why, it doesn't make sense.

It was insane.

No. I mean, it doesn't make sense.

Your dad, he's got contacts
in the department.

You filed your stalker complaint
and he knew inside of a week.

How could he not know
that you are turning tricks?

I was completely out of his life then

and I was under alias, Ashley Smith.

So he had you under contract?

I had a two-year deal with Barnes.

I met Duane two months
into my second year.

And he borrowed money
from Yates to buy you out.

Yeah, $52,000.

We've been paying it off
for the last seven years.

Not anymore, you're not.

I don't know what kind of slush
fund my father gives you,

but I'd really prefer
this not get back to him.

It won't, because it wasn't his money.

In case you owe us the last one,

if you ever need anything
my address is on the card.

I mean it, Duane.

I'd be around for you guys
as long as I'm around.

All right.

Thanks for helping us!

You're welcome!

Take care of each other!

Thanks for coming, Bill!

I realize it's a long trip up here

for something that could've
been arranged remotely.

That's really no problem.

You sent for a man a
couple dozen times a year,

doesn't respond much less show you up.

Then you pay him a couple $100,000

and suddenly that two-and-a-half
hour long trek from the city

is no problem.

I thought Gunther
would be here tonight.

Yeah, well, he is busy at the
office preparing an announcement

for later tonight.

Good news I hope.

I'm not going to sugarcoat things, Bill.

I don't appreciate being kept
in the dark about my daughter.

Come again?

I know about the sex club.

My people have
informed me about it

while they were verifying
your reports.

Verifying my reports?

You didn't think I'd
send you into the fields

without oversight?

Well, first of all, she is
not working in a sex club.

My own flesh and blood, Bill;
my own daughter in the back,

how that goddamn seedy hole
with the scum of society

touching every part
of her body for a buck

and you just sitting there watching.

Let me ask you something, Bill.

If the roles were reversed,

do you think I would keep that
kind of information from you,

your own flesh and blood?

You've got the wrong
information, Councilman.

Oh, I don't think I have
the wrong information.

Does Ashley Smith ring a bell?

She's turning tricks for Conrad Barnes

Now we can argue about whether
I was being kept in the dark?

Gunther and I mutually decided..

Let's not blame Gunther,

and I'm dealing with him separately.

I'm not blaming Gunther, John.

I'm just saying,

Gunther and I mutually decided

that Jessica's vocation in the club

was a separate issue we
would deal with it separately.

You cut me out, Bill, pure and simple.

You knew Jessica was lost to the dregs,

I wouldn't stand for it, but
you still wanted to get paid,

is the same old Bill.

You know, friend, you're
a goddamn expenditure.

Your name is Bill for Christ sakes!

I want you to take your money

and I want you to get the hell out.

We're through.

Let me tell you something
about your daughter, Councilman.

You may not approve of the way
that she has lived her life,

she has made some mistakes sure.

She is a good woman,
and a little more honest

than we ever were.

Sorry about your
reconciliation, I mean it.

Sarah, I'm a bit surprised.

I knew you're going to be home
today I didn't want to miss you.

Well, you didn't so now you can go.

I know something is wrong, Bill.

I realize that you were
trying to tell me something

What I was trying to tell you,
is exactly what I told you.

It's about the nosebleeds, isn't it?

You're sick with something, aren't you?

We've always been honest
with each other, Bill.

You can be honest about this too.

Sarah, go home!

Tom!

Go home!

After everything I did to try helping you,

I thought we were friends.

You've got three days
to get out of my building

or I promise I am going
to move you out myself.

I trusted you and you fucked me.

Hey! You're home?

Your phone is ringing.

Hey, Gunther!

Great news.

Just came from the announcement.

I'm going to be Press Secretary.

It's going to be a great night, buddy.

Gunther, we need to talk.

You cracked your case
and I got my promotion.

Gunther, something
very bad is happening.

To us, buddy!

Your phone is still ringing.

Gunther, I've got a fucking
situation here;

I need your help with.

What's the story with this Roscoe?

This is the felony weapon
stretch, my friend.

What the fuck you mean take me in?

Stand up!

Are you going to take me in?

It's fucking bullshit, Gunther!

I'm just fucking with you, Bill.

Relax!

Oh before I forget, the results
came back from the lab.

Do you know whose prints
were on that last letter?

Mine.

The old man is just
too weak and brittle,

he didn't have the backbone
to do what needs to be done.

He may had before
but he doesn't now.

I can't just leave you on
the icebox's liability.

You've got too much shit going
too far back on the old man.

Eventually, you'd fuck us all.

I always knew you were a psycho fuck.

Yeah, you should've known.

I thought you did but I guess you didn't.

And the girl,

too convenient.

You always had a weakness
for the wrong lady.

So I guess I'll be shooting
myself in the head tonight.

If you just hadn't fucked up
on that Interborough bullshit,

that was lazy, sloppy work, Ivers.

You just needed to buckle down,

have some fucking self-actualization.

Bill!

How's that for self-actualization

you son of a bitch?

They took Jessica.

We have Lord's daughter,
bring $250,000

in non-sequential hundred dollar bills

in a black athletic bag to Ericsson Field

by 6:00 P.M. tonight.

No police!

If you attempt to involve
the police we'll know.

Lord's daughter will die

and you'll find that out
on the Six O'Clock News.

Jessica's father is dead.

Who the fuck is Lord?

John Lord is a New York City Councilman.

He is Jessica's real father
and he is very much alive.

He's the guy who hired me.

Jessica said you had
something on Yates,

got our loan forgiven.

Is that why this is happening?

No. I covered your marker
with my own money.

Yates must have found out whose
kid she was some other way,

maybe someone on the
department, I don't know.

You've got to get that
money from Lord.

That's not going to happen.

Lord's lost it.

Even if you wanted to pay the ransom,

he'd just bring every cop
in the city and fuck it up.

I've got about 170,000 in loose cash.

I can break into the real estate
office and steal the safe.

I don't know how much is in there but..

No, it's not going to work.
It's not a bank.

They don't keep that
kind of cash around.

You know, I've got somebody
we can talk to about this.

Hey Jimmy!

You've grown.

I thought you'd be dead by now.

Not yet.

How's your aunt doing?

I'm not happy to see you, Bill.

Who do we have here?

Hey Liz!

You've got some nice friends out there.

Hey handsome!

Come a little closer.

Bill, you got old, Bill.

Yeah, we all did.

What happened to that
handsome face of yours?

You sleep with the
garbage man's wife again?

Yeah.

It's good to see you, Liz.

How sweet of you
to visit me on my birthday.

It's not a birthday without a surprise.

I miss you, Bill.

I've been thinking
about you lately.

I'm not really here to talk
to you about that today, Liz.

I'm in kind of a time-sensitive situation

I could use your help with.

Well, that's fascinating, Bill.

Ah!

You know, the Interborough
case wasn't kind to you, Liz.

I wasn't kind to you either.

Yeah, well, I did what I had to do.

You seemed to be doing all
right, business-wise anyway.

How's your wife, Bill?

I haven't talked to her in two years.

You really want to have
this conversation now?

No, not really.

And you came to see me, remember?

And as you can see, it's my birthday,

so I'm not really in the
mood for a fucking argument.

Fine. Fuck!

Just like old times.

I've got a friend in trouble, Liz.

Hmm, how much Bill?

75 grand.

As a businessman, I can't be
giving out that kind of money.

It's a personal matter.

Yeah, not to me, isn't it?

Look, I know you don't
think much of me.

Maybe you don't
have much reason to.

I am genuinely sorry for
what happened between us.

But fuck, Liz have you
looked at yourself lately?

Is that seriously your sales pitch?

I know you don't got long to go, Liz.

but you're not the only one.

Jesus Christ, don't fucking
apologize to me, Liz!

This girl's got a legitimate
shot and a regular life,

I know there's a fucking human
being in there somewhere, Liz.

I'm asking you to do this for us

and both of us.

What have you got for collateral?

Nothing.

And I need you to get
me in to see Yates today.

Let's go!

You've got two minutes with the man.

Just stand seven feet
back, you don't sit down,

you don't shake hands

and you're done, when
he says you're done.

Got it?

Got it!

After you!

Detective!

You look like shit.

What can I do for you today?

Mr. Yates, I brought your money.

If It's all the same to you,
I'd like to dispense

with the whole open-field
showdown thing

and just walk out of
here with the girl now.

Which girl exactly did you think

you were going to
walk out of here with?

Jessica.

Jessica?

I don't seek to have any
Jessica's with me today.

I have Tanya.

I brought your money, let's get to it.

Does this guy owe us money?

You've got the wrong house, pal.

Hold on! You've got a couple
of goons that work for you,

one of them has got a woman's name?

Yeah, they don't work for me anymore.

Does a kid named Duane,
have a marker with you?

Are you still a cop?

I am a convicted felon.

All right, look, this guy
comes in here what --

a couple of weeks ago, right?

And he buys the marker from me.

I don't know his name.

I don't know where he went.

I don't know how to reach him, okay?

Now, if you don't mind,

I would like for you
to get the fuck out.

You can leave the
money if you want.

Fuck you!

you think you'll always
get another chance.

Flunk out of school,
try again next year.

Short of cash?

Charge it.

And then, one day
you wake up and realize

no rich friend can
bail you out of this one.

You've been charging
it your whole life.

Predicated every rotten
fucking thing you ever did

on some future act of goodness.

With the exchange I want
you inside the car.

Don't get out.

Keep the engine running.

Nothing is going to go wrong as
long as you stay inside the car.

You're going to want
to get out and meet her,

I'm telling you don't.

Stay in the car.

Let her come to you.

Are you okay?

As soon as she is back in the car

you drive out of here
as fast as you can.

What about you?

Stay in the car.

One day I woke up
a stiff, slow old man.

Now I'm just sitting here
day-after-day getting old.

And the older I get,
the faster life goes by.

No matter what I try
to do to slow it down,

it just keeps going faster.

I'm closer now to the
end than the beginning,

and nobody's here but me.

What have I done?

You're driving for these guys too?

Jessica!

No! No! No!

You color outside the lines,
sometimes it works out,

sometimes you get fucked.

He is coming with us.

Sit up, man!

Come on! Let's go!

Jesus Christ! Will you
have some fucking pride.

Get these people in
the goddamn car ready.

Did I do anything?

Anything anyone will remember?

Anything good?
