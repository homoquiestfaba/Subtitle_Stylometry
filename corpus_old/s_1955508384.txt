At one time, Deep in the
country of France...

There lived a handsome prince, who
lived in magnificent palaces.

Though he had
everything he wanted...

Prince was cruel and selfish.

Sir, it's time.

He imposes high taxes on the people to
fill the castle with beautiful things.

We did it.

And party with great people.

On one night there was an intruder
who arrived at the castle.

He sought refuge from the storm.

As a reward he offers
a rose to the Prince.

Disgusted by the poor performances
jeered her prince gift,

Then, the woman warned her to
not be fooled by appearances...

Because of the beauty,
indeed there is in him.

And, when she drove back, old
woman transform herself...

be beautiful and
fascinating woman.

The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late...

because he had seen no
love within the prince.

As punishment, he changed the
prince into a horrible creature...

and left a curse on the palace,
and all who live in it.

Day turned into years, the prince and
his servant have been forgotten.

Magicians keep them
remember loved ones,

but the roses he
had a magic roses.

lf he can learn to love each
other and love unrequited,

when the last leaf falls then,
the curse will disappear

lf not, he will be damned
as bad beast forever.

Years passed He fell into
despair and loss of hope...

waiting to see who will learn
to love the horrible creature?

Small town

Quiet village

Every day like any other day

The small town Full
of little people

Waking up to say:

Bonjour! Bonjour!

lt was the baker with
his tray as usual

The same bread ready for sale

Every morning the same
Since the morning we come

For a poor provincial towns

Good morning, Belle!

Good morning, Monsieur!

Looks like.

The problem is l can not

Look at this girl she

l doubt if he's healthy

His nose is always a dreamy
way, stuck facing book

For us it was a girls 'Belle'

This is my favorite part

Because you'll know

This, when he met
the handsome prince

but he would not meet him

Until part three

There's no doubt why the
name of the 'Beauty'

There is no iota of similarity

Behind the face of
reasonable Kuyakin him odd

Very different from us all

He does not like us.

He's different with
us all the 'Belle'

Look at him.

My future wife.

Belle is the prettiest
girl in the village.

That makes her the best.
But he is predictable.

You're very athletic.

l know. She is beautiful.
Yes. You got us.

Yes, since the war
l lost something.

He's the only one who
gave me the spark.

l dont know the meaning.

When l first saw and met him

l told you she was beautiful
and l are interested

ln this city just him

As beautiful as me

And l want to woo
and marry Belle

Look, look at him he's not great

Mr. Gaston Oh, he is handsome

Stay tuned .. my heart, l
was difficult to breathe

He was tall, sinister,
handsome and ruthless

That will never happen, ladies.

Not that it was but a book.
For your dinner table.

Tonight?

Sorry, not tonight.

So get on with life? - The selling
expensive to make the sweetest prey.

lt makes Belle very tempting.

What is the name?

Pride.

That is interesting.

How moment lasts forever?

How can a story never dies?

We must hold on love

Not easy, but we try

Sometimes we get
caught happiness

Somehow, place and
time stood still

Love lives in our
hearts and will always

Belle, can you give me...

thanks.

No.

Actually this.

You think it's a little weird?
Strange?

Daughter's strange. Where
did you have the idea?

People are talking.

This small village.
Small mind also.

But smaller also means secure.

Even back in Paris a girl
like you is very great.

You're different.

People mocked him.

Until they imitate.

Please tell one
another about it.

Your mother without fear.

Without fear.

So what can l bring

Rose. As in painting.

You asked every year.
-And every year you bring him.

What are you doing?

Teach a woman to read.

ls that not enough?

We have to do something.

You're incredible

Nobody had ever seen.

But at least l know.

May l remind you about the time?

What is wrong?
There are women who need help.

Time to be a hero.

l'm not done with you.

l also.

Belle, l heard you had a problem
with the school principal.

May l give you a little advice?

Do not ever trust him.
What l want is to teach children to read.

The only children who should
you care about is yourself.

Yourself.

l'm not ready to have children.
Maybe you have not met the right guy.

No, Gaston. l've met them all.

Maybe you should
take another look.

Some of us changed.
Gaston, we will never be happy.

Nobody can change that much.
Oh, Belle.

You know what happens
when his father died?

They beg.

This is our world, Belle.

People like us are not
going to be better.

l may be a simple girl,

l'm not simple

l'm not going to marry Gaston.
Forgive me.

Can you imagine me to
be the man's wife bore

Mrs. Gaston

Can you see it?

Mrs. Gaston

No, sir! Not me!

And for once it might be great

Having someone who understands

Very beautiful. l wish l

You know we are where?
Because l do not know.

We can pass here.

Come on. To the right.

There he is.

One road was closed,

OK.

Slowly.

Be careful slippery.

Come on.

Ay, Phillip!

Humans today.
He was talking about me.

Oops.

Wherever you're hiding

Much better.

Much better.

because it was creepy.

Sorry.

lt is okay.

l can not thank you enough
for your generosity

l...

Come on. Go.

Wait! Wait.

You forget the roses.

Are here?

There is a rose.

This.

Where is Papa?

Take me to him.

See. Beautiful girl.

Yes, l could see the girl.

Except for the hands and eyes.
Maybe he can break the curse.

Who's talking?

Who is there?

Papa, is that you?

How did you find me?

Your hands are cold.

We need to go home.

He lives.

Now go before he found you!

Who?

Who is there?

Who are you?!

Who are you?

l came to pick up my father.

Your father is a thief.

Liar!

He stole a rose.
l asked her roses.

Law l'm not him.

No. That forever.

That's what happened here
when you pick flowers.

A life sentence for the roses?

l received the curse
of a lifetime.

Now you still want to replace your father?
Yes.

Select - l will not let you do it. l
lost my mother is not with you, too.

Now go away.

All right, Dad, l'm gone.

l need more time with him.

You're so coldhearted. You
did not let me say goodbye.

Give it time.

lf it is closed, it
will not open again.

l should be with. - No.

lt is okay.

Now go away.

Continue your life
and forget me.

Forget you? All
l've got for you.

l love you, Belle.
Do not be afraid.

l love you too, Dad.

l am not afraid.

And l'm going to run
away, l promise.

What? What?

You take his place.

He's my father.
He was stupid.

And you, too.

Belle.

Father! Do not hurt him!

Dad! - Belle.

Belle! l will be back!

l promise!

Sorry l disturb, Miss.

But l have come to escort
you to your room a new one.

My room?

But l thought...
Oh, what? Words...

''Once the door is closed,
it will not open again.''

l know he's overrated.

Hello.

Oh, you're very strong.
lt's a good quality.

Creature are you?

l Lumiere. -And...

You can talk.
Of course he can talk.

That's all he did.

Now, Lumiere. As head
of the furniture,

l ask you to immediately
prepare the food.

You want to be for the rest of your
life, Cogsworth? Humans, or hours?

Ready, Miss? Trust me.

You do not be surprised.
l was surprised.

l'm talking to the candle.
l sconce.

lt's French. Lumiere ready to
serve, the palace is now yours.

So you can be anywhere.
Except to the west wing.

And we did not have it.

Why? What was in the West Wing?

Oh, nothing. - There is no.

Warehouse. - Warehouse.

That is all. - That is all.

Yes, that's it. Please pass
here to go to the east wing.

And l want to say,
only one wing.

Carefully step.

Welcome to your room a new one.
lt's simple, but comfortable.

lt's beautiful.

But of course, the hosts want you
to get the best room in the palace.

Gosh, we're waiting for guests.

Nice to meet you, Miss.

Do not worry, l'll clean
up this place quickly.

Dangerous plan.

l will risk all to kiss
you again, Plumette.

Do not love. l've
dikewakan by you.

We have to be strong.
How can l be strong,

when you made me very weak.

Everything here alive?

Hello. What is your name?

lt was only a hairbrush.

Do not be afraid.
lt's just a closet.

Meet, Madame Garderobe.

-A great singer.
When he realized.

Good morning. My sleep soundly.

Stay with us, ma'am. We bring
someone to your makeup.

Finally, a woman.

Good eyes. The
face of the proud.

The perfect canvas. Nice!

l'll swatch you are
fit for a princess.

Oh, not a princess.
Nonsense.

Now, let's see what l
have in my drawer.

Embarrassing.

Froufrou, help the mother.

Good, l like it. Dah.

Froufrou, send my
love to the Maestro.

lmagine LeFou. Comfortable home.

Hurry last roasted in the fire.

Our children are running
around, while my wife...

Massaging my feet were tired.
Said Belle...

''l'll never marry you, Gaston.''

You know, there are other girls.

Great hunter does not spend
his time with the rabbits.

LeFou Oh, you're the best.

Why is not there a girl
who is close to you?

They told me that l was so dependent.
But l do not understand.

Please!

Komohon, anyone. Anyone.

You have to help me. - Why?

You have to help me.
lt's about Belle.

lt's about Belle. He was jailed.

Who is detained?
Ugly creature.

Ugly horrible creatures great.

My daughter lives in danger,
why are you laughing?

This is not ajoke.

The palace was
hidden in the woods.

There have been winter.
Winter in June?

Crazy old Maurice.
Listen to me!

Ugly creature really exists.

You understand?

No one wants to help me?

l will help you, Maurice.

You want?

All.

Stop mocking this man.

Thank you, Captain.

Do not thank me, Maurice.

Show us the way to being ugly.

Come on.

Mom, there's a girl in the palace.
Yes, Chip.

You already know.
He likes what tea?

Herbal, oolong, camomile.

l'm too excited. - Stop.

lt will break your hand.
-Already, Ny. Potts.

Lumiere!
Calm down, let me do the talking.

You make him dinner.
We thought you wanted company.

Sir, l want to tell you,
if l had nothing to do in

prepare dinner.

Designing a dress for her, gave
him a room in the east wing.

You gave him the room? - No.

He gave him room. - Correct.

But this girl who can
break the spell,

and perhaps you could start by using
the dinner to make him fascinated.

Good thinking, Cogsworth.
What?

That's the most ridiculous
idea l've ever heard.

Make fascinated prisoners.
But you have to try, sir.

With each day that
passes, we are changing.

He's a thief.

Do you think it has to what?
You can not judge people

by their father, right?

You're going to have dinner with me.
lt was not a request.

Gently, sir. The
girl lost her father

and freedom in one day.

Yes, maybe now she was
frightened once inside.

Correct.

Hold on. - See? There he is.

Now, remember. Gentle.

Kind-hearted. - Enchanting.

-And sweet.
-And when he opened the door,

give him a smile.

Come on, show me that smile.

Forget it.

You want to have dinner with me?

You're holding me, and now you
want to have dinner with me?

You are crazy? - He is angry.

Gosh.

l told you to have dinner with me!
-And l say no!

Gosh, what time? What happened?

l'd better starve
than l eat with you.

Please! Up to you!

lf he does not eat with
me, so he did not eat!

Stupid!

He's gone?

l'm late? Unfortunately, this time
l'm really going to scold him.

Sir, you're back. - What?

You're so funny. - Gotcha.

Show me the girl.

One more petals fall.
Lumiere.

l grow three feathers again. And
l just pull it out yesterday.

l know, dear.

Every day l was
getting into metal.

Oh no. lt happened again.

Sorry. - Everything is quiet.

We still have time.

Mother, what l'm going
to be a child again?

Yes, Chip. You will enjoy
a day in the sun again.

Leave it to me.

l told you to go.
Do not worry dear.

lt Ny. Potts.

Oh, you look beautiful.

Seanng once knew you.

Oh, this is a long journey.

Let me prepare you
before you left.

l knew if tired after
the trip could be lost

after a cup of tea.

Slowly, Chip.

Nice to meet you.

Want to see me do the trick?

Chip.

You did a very brave thing
for your father, dear.

Yes, so in our opinion.

l'm worried about him.
He was never alone.

Calm down, dear. Everything
will change in the end.

You'll feel much
better after dinner.

But he said, ''lf he does not want to
eat with me, then he should not eat.''

People talk carelessly
when angry.

lt is up to us to not listen.

You coming, dear?

They came. Semuanay
last inspection.

Fast. - Come on.

lf the host know you
made the girl's food,

She'll blame me.
l'll make sure of it.

But what you see? l
tell this girl man.

They should fall in love that we
return to a human being again,

and how they can fall in love
if she stays in her room?

Hey, you there is still dirt.
Excuse me.

Excuse me.
You know that girl would not love him.

Hours broken right twice
a day, my friend.

But this is not the time.
Come on.

Now it's time to shine!

Hey, l could not feel,
but l know this is bad.

Move over, you're bothering me.

Fast. - Come on.

Slowly. - Of course.

But what is dinner
without music?

Music?
Maestro Cadenza, are you ready?

l have not been performed.

l do not even remember how.

Cavities others.
Maestro, teeth above.

lncreasingly difficult
to remain conscious.

He's relying on you to help
us to break this curse.

Then l'll play
despite a toothache.

Maestro, play some
soothing music.

Quiet music. Of course.

There are other requests that
you want of my artistic?

No, that's all.
There you are, dear.

Nona.

We welcome you with great pride and
pleasure to welcome you this evening.

And now, we invite you to relax.

Let us take a seat.

While the dining room
proudly presents...

Pudding?

Why are you nice to me?

Of course you're
trapped here like me.

You never want to go?

Tuan was not as bad as it looks.

Somewhere, in his soul,
he was a Pengeran.

Someone is waiting
to be unleashed.

Lumiere mentions something
about the west wing.

Forget it. Go to sleep, dear.

Good night. - Good night.

Directly to the room.

What are you doing? What
did you do on a rose?

There is no.
You do not realize what can you do?

You can harm us all!
Go away from here!

Go!

Checkmate. Again. - Wait.

You cheated again.
Miss, what are you doing?

Go away from here. - Stop!

Do not, froufrou.

Froufrou, stop him.
Catch him!

Come on!

Do not, froufrou.
Do not get out.

Do not! Dog silly.
Naughty dog, bad dog!

Do not!

Please do not go! That is dangerous!
Yikes!

You have to help.

You have to stand.

l'm sure this is the way.
There are a lot of wolves.

That means we're getting
close to the palace.

Simply, we have to go back.

Stop! There he is!

There he is. That tree.

l am sure.

The time it collapsed
due to lightning.

But now the tree...

Stand back again because...

Magic, or the other.

Do you want to marry
into this family?

So it means, istanya toward...
No.

That is...

That way. Certainly.

lt's enough you play us.

Where is Belle?

The ugly kidnapped her...
The creature was not real.

Or cup speak. Or magic.

What was real was the wolves,
frostbite and starvation.

lnhale, Gaston.

Why do not we just go
back to the village?

l'm sure Belle was cooking
a delicious evening meal.

Why are you offering to help us?

Because he was not my
biological daughter!

Let us go home.

Belle was not at home.
He shared...

Say it again,

Then l'll make you a wolf food!
Gaston!

Stop!

Think about things that are fun.

Remember back during the war.

lmagine about the explosion...

-... The women widows. - Widow.

Correct. lmagine.

Correct.

Maurice.

Please forgive me.

That's no way to talk to the
prospective father-in-law, is not it?

Father-in-law?

You'll never marry my daughter.

l might have guessed it.

lf Maurice does not approve it,
it means he becomes penghalangku.

Once the wolf is finished with her,
Belle will not have anyone but me.

l know we're running
out of options,

but maybe you want to think
about how a little more...

-... Human? - You coming?

Sick.

lf you can be quiet, it
will not be too sore.

lf you did not run,
this will not happen.

lf you do not scare me,
l'm not going to run.

You should not go
to the East wing!

You're supposed to learn
to control his anger!

You should rest.

Thank you.
We are very grateful.

Why are you so concerned about her?
We have maintained for a long time.

He cursed you, even though
you are not doing anything.

You are right.

When Mr. losing his mother,

and when the father grabbed the
child a sweet and innocent,

change it to be like his father,

we can only dwell alone.

Let him sleep.

SONG: Days ln The Sun #
days when life begins #

# Not until my day ends #

#What l'm going to leave #

#What l will bow again ## By
the rhythm of the song dear #

Tuan will be ugly forever.

-And we'll be... - antiques.

Knick knacks.
The furniture is rarely used.

Trash. We become garbage.

l want to help you.

There must be a way
to break the curse.

There is one way.

You do not have to
think about it.

We choose our options, and we
must bear the consequences.

Drink.

Termia love, Agathe.

Love can change a person's view.

Love looks way of thinking
is not the appearance.

And because it was the angel
of love blinded his eyes.

You know Shakespeare.

My education is quite high.

Romeo and Juliet is my favorite.

l'm not surprised.

Sorry?
She let her heart melt...

...and...

You'd better read another.

Like what?

You can start reading
all that is here.

You're going to do it?

Awesome.

Yes, l think so.

lf you really like it,
then all of it is yours.

Did you read all these books?

Not all.

Some of them speak Greek.

Are you kidding me?

Can you kidding me right now?

Maybe.

The air is so blue
and clear and cold.

Frozen in thin sheets.

Rolled stems and twigs

Each foliage in a blanket by...

...glass.

l feel like l've seen this.

What else?

But in the silence...

... He heard whispers
from all asleep.

Face. Look at me.

Come and wake me up.

Because l'll always be here.

SONG: SOMETHlNG THERE #
There is a sweet and good #

# But he was nasty and rude #

# Now he is changing
and unsure #

# l wonder why l did
not realize before #

# He glanced over
here l think l see #

#When the touch he does not
tremble viewed cakarku #

### Ku may not disregard it #

# But he had never seen
me like that before #

# New and makes me uneasy #

#Who would have thought
this could happen? #

# True, he is not a
handsome prince #

# But there was something about
him that l did not realize #

Who would have thought
### Bless my soul #

#Who would have thought #

#Who would have thought they
would unite with itself #

lt is strange ###We see #

#We pay attention
to a few days away #

# There may be something
that was not there #

# There may be something
there that was not there #

What, Mom?

# There may be something
there that was not there #

What is that? What is
going on over there?

l'll let you know
when you've grown.

OK. l've grown up.

Oh, Chip.

You're a grown-up.

What are you reading?
lt is nothing.

l guess ''Lancelot.''

Actually, ''King Arthur and the
Knights of the Roundtable.''

Nonetheless,

The reading romance. - OK.

l have to thank you
for saving my life.

l have to thank you because it
has been rescued from the wolf.

You know how to enjoy life.
Yes.

When l walked into the
room and laughing.

l also.

The villagers told
me a strange girl.

l do not know they are
praising or insulting.

Sorry.

Your village does not seem good.

l felt lonely as does kastilmu.

Why do not we run away together?

lt was a gift from the witch.

Books that can help you escape.

Awesome.

This game is the most violent.

Almost like a curse.

This world has no place
for creatures like me.

But you can.

Think of a place
you want to visit.

Discover in mind.

Feel in your heart.

Where is this?

Paris.

Oh, l remember Paris.

What do you want to see first?

Rotterdam. Champs-Elysees.

No? Too many tourists?

Smaller than l imagined.

SONG: How Does a Moment Last Forever
# This is my childhood Paris #

Once this is my
life boundary ##

#At the top of a rickety
and dusty attic is #

#Where an artist
mencinitai wife #

# Easy to remember #

# Difficult to forget #

Knowing the Paris
of my childhood ##

# Has gone #

What happened to your mother?

He never told me.

l never dared to ask.

Mask doctor.

We have to go now.

Drink this.
lt would kill him, too.

Sorry to call your
father a thief.

Let us go home.

lt sucks.

At least we were not in the trees
and surrounded by a pack of wolves.

You know not too
late to go back.

Every time l close my eyes,

l imagined when l was stranded,
and when l opened my eyes...

Maurice.

Gaston. You're trying
to kill Maurice?

Maurice. Fortunately.

l've been looking for five days.

You're trying to kill me. You
left me with a herd of wolves.

Wolf?

l understand, if
you're imagining,

but not if you accusing me of
deliberately want to kill you.

Maurice, do you have proof?

Tanya Agathe, he saved me.
-Agathe?

You accuse based on
statements from an old woman?

Sorry, Agathe.

Mr. LeFou. He was there.

She saw everything.

l? You are right.

Do not joke.

LeFou.

Dear friend of mine.

ls it me, the most loyal friend,

tried to kill the father of
a woman who l really love?

That question is
quite difficult.

But the answer is no.

He did not try to kill Maurice.

Basic you...

Maurice.

l hate to say this, but you'll endanger
yourself and the people around you.

That is why Belle run.

You need help.

A place to take a
load off your mind.

Everything will be alright.

l saw her in the
ballroom and said,

''l will make all look beautiful
and tonight we'll dance.''

l did not think he
would say ''yes.''

What l think? - No, sir.

lt was perfect.

Petals roses are only four,
it means to be tonight.

You must tell your
feelings to her.

l feel stupid.

He might not love me.
Do not be discouraged.

He is.

Stop saying that.

No way we are united.
You care about him, is not it?

Then, with romantic
music and candles...

True, and when the
time is right...

How could l know?

Do not worry, sir.
You'll be fine.

Do not be too nervous and
say you feel about Belle.

Because if not, l swear you
will drink cold tea forever.

ln the dark. - Full dust.

Dark and very dusty.

Starting from his
hair, comb his hair.

l'll take care of her nails.

l'll brush her teeth.

Rub her nails. Polishing horns.

Close your eyes.

And this is the last.

Voila!

OK. l can clean up this.

Oh, beautiful.

But something is missing.

Oh, right.

Last touch.

After all this time,

l almost forgot the taste.

This seems stupid.

For such a creature l hope...

... One day it will
get your attention.

l do not know. - Really?

Do you think you
will be happy here?

Whether a person can be
happy without freedom?

My father taught
me how to dance.

l often stepped on his foot.

You must miss him.

Very.

You want to see him?

l want to see my father.

Father!

What did they do to him?

He is in danger!

What are you saying?

You've got to save.

You need to hurry.

Bring it.

So you have a way to see me.

Oh, my God.

Sir, l've figured everything
would run smoothly.

True love always wins.

l let it go.

What?

Sir, why did you do it?

l must.

But why?
Because he loves her.

So why do we not change?
Because Belle does not love him.

Now it's too late.
But he might come back.

No.

l released him.

l hope l can do the
same thing to you.

Go.

Our time is running out.

Go on, my love.

anybody in my life.

he's still there.

More than me.

Now l know you never feel it.

Although he escaped.

He kept torturing me, coming to hurt
me, menggerakanku, come against me.

Waiting for my loneliness.

Waiting at the end
of the open door.

l feel myself to appear
in front of him.

And along with me forever more.

l'm ready to fight
a crazy court.

l hit the light is blurred.

He is already in reach.

He was never far outside.

And l knew he would
never see me.

Although he felt guilt.

He's still inside me. He
taught everything l do.

Waiting loneliness, waiting
at the end of the open door.

l walked right in front of him.

And it perbicaraan in
a very long night.

l think it could be waiting
here forever more...

Come on.

Exempt queen, please.

He was in the hospital.

Not in silence.

Do not you see? You deserve
to be in a mental hospital?

You would not last a week.

Submit your daughter to me,
and l'll set you free.

Will never.

Stop.

Pa. - Oh, boy.

l thought l lost you.
Let her go.

Please release him.

We can not do that Miss Potts,
we'll take care of it properly.

My father was not crazy.

Gaston. Tell him.

You know how l am
loyal to your family,

but your father made
amazing claims.

That's right Bell.

He discusses about a
monster in the palace.

l just got out of the palace,
and there was a monster.

You can say anything to release,
words are difficult to prove.

You want proof?

Show me the monster that to me!

That's the proof.

lt's unbelievable.

See the monster.

Look at this.

Gosh. Do not be afraid.
She is gentle, and kind.

lt smelled like a monster.

lf l do not know right or bad.
He remains concerned him.

He was not a monster, Gaston!

You're the monster.

Monster was not going
to hurt anyone.

Hearts have been infected with dark
magic, l've never seen in my life.

This rift in our great justice.

Yes! Do something!

We're not going to run
to win from monsters.

Catch him also.

No!

Get him! - No!

You're not going to get
away with this, Gaston.

Gaston.

Why fat? You want to be next?

That's what l said.

damned if we do not stop it.

Yes! - We kill that monster!

Kill the monster! Kill him!

lt's safe here until he
comes at night to scare us.

With sacrifice. l was not
appetizing at the monsters.

He will attack our village,

lt is now time for
action, everything.

Now it's time to follow.

He disguised himself and came out of the
darkness, From the shadow of a nightmare.

And it was most encouraging.

Save them.

He would sneak into the palace, and
did something terrible inside.

He's a monster, he's got fangs.
Sharp.

Large claw, claw

Hear him roar, see the foam! But we
did not get home before he died!

Until he's dead!
Kill the monster!

You can bet they will all

There's a monster.

Running clay, no question.

But l'm worried that the
wrong monster released.

Take ajourney! Calculate!
Hold your sword! Hold thine!

Praise the Lord
