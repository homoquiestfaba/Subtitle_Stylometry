Okay, remember what we talked about?

Use the product rule
to find the derivative.

I can't do this.

Hey, Corinne, not now.

Yeah, you can, Simon.

I've seen your scratch work.

Just take your time.

Focus on the equation.

Okay, I can't learn this by tomorrow.

I'm totally fried.

Can't you just give 'em to me?

Simon.

Please.

Thanks.

You can't tell anyone about this.

As soon as the test
is over, destroy it.

You're lucky, that was my last one.

Don't you need it?

No.

Hello?

Laina, this is Dr. Perkash,

your mother is asking to be
discharged from the hospital.

What?

She's not so much asking as signing
herself out of care against our advice.

I'll be right there.

Just please try to stall her.

Okay, guys, time to go.

Hi, there they are.

This is perfect.

Can you take that to the car for mommy?

Mom, what are you doing?

I am checking out.

You know what, sweetheart, I
left your markers in my room.

Wanna go to mommy's room
and go get your markers?

Is mommy coming home?

Yes, I am.

Mom, you need to be here,
they can't treat you at home.

I know.

Laina, can I have a word?

Here, I know it's not all
of it, but I can get more.

Oh, um, no, we're past that.

Her white blood cell count
is not doing her any favors.

And this kind of aggressive depletion
doesn't give us a lot of options.

But she can't come home, right?

She's not gonna get any better there.

I think the best thing any one can do
now is to just keep her comfortable.

I'm sorry.

Can you help me carry my suitcase?

Uh huh.

Hey, I'm gonna make a run to
the kitchen, want anything?

No, I'm good Blake, thanks for asking.

You go ahead.

All right, thanks man.

All right.

Oh my.

I honestly think I've done
that to you like 19 times.

Yeah, well, that's the last time..

I didn't mean it like that.

I just, I don't want to talk about it.

Ellie, no matter what happens, I'll...

I didn't come here
to talk about the test.

Come on, I wanna show you something.

Okay.

Sh! It's a secret.

Come on, Ellie.

Oh my god.

Ellie we shouldn't be doing this.

Calm down.

Live a little.

Ellie, did you bring your bathing suit?

No.

Go on.

What's wrong?

I'm scared, Blake.

Hey, we're in this together.

I'll take care of you.

Hey, Blake.

You know, I think I do want
something from the kitchen.

I found him at the Bilski's pool.

Bilskis?

You want a Pop-Tart?

No thanks.

Some people like to toast these.

But I never have the
patience, you know.

Love 'em.

Did you have fun tonight?

You got anything going on tomorrow?

Oh wait, my god, you have a test.

It's test day tomorrow.

I completely forgot myself,

it's so easy to forget
something like that, isn't it?

I get it.

Hey, sorry.

Look, there's nothing wrong with having
a little fun every once in a while,

but you gotta pick your moments.

The night before a life altering
test it's not the moment.

Got it.

Solid lecture.

Almost done.

Now, I know that you don't really
care what I think about this girl.

Ellie.

Ellie, but she's a distraction.

Now you have tomorrow, and next year.

And after that you have the whole
rest of your life to be distracted.

Don't eff it up.

You sure you don't want a Pop-Tart?

Good night, Dad.

Hey...come here.

No, no, no.

No!

Move along.

Shit!

Hey, Lana, right?

Yeah, Laina.

Laina.
It's cool.

Sorry, um.

This is kind of an awkward question.

I was hoping that I could
buy one of your study guides?

I can't.

What do you mean I can't.

I just gave the last one away.

Shit.

Hey Laina, wait up.

So, you and Blake Renning, huh?

No, not really.

He didn't even know my name.

He didn't know your name?

But we've been in school
with him since first grade

and there's less and
less kids each year.

I know, it's pretty tragic.

Geez, well, it's almost as tragic as
being in love with your best friend

who's in love with the guy that
doesn't even know her name.

But that's just something
I saw in a movie once.

Not today, Kellan.

Yeah, you're right, tomorrow's
actually better for me anyway.

No laptops, computer devices.

Hey, what the.

Get back here.

All units converse at the south gate.

We got a runner.

Get that kid.

Heading your way, now.

Whoa, I've never seen a kid
make it past the guards before.

Kellan.

Are you hacking into
your dad's account again?

Uh, yeah.

Bring him down.

You're surrounded.

Move in.

Come up now, on him.

Move in, boys.

So you're going to send the stolen
security footage to the news?

You ever heard of Wendy Banks?

No.

Well, she's a very prominent
news reporter in Austin

and I have her direct, personal,
general inquiries email address,

so I'm sending her hot
tips all the time.

Does she ever reply?

Whoa, I think I have
more than enough questions

to answer today, thank you, very much.

You're gonna be okay, okay?

You can do this, yeah?

Commence lock down sequence.

Yes sir.

Warning, lock down is now in progress.

30 seconds 'til lock down.

Testing to begin in 15 minutes.

Good morning, everyone.

I hope you all had a good night sleep.

I just want you to know

that you've all had a great year,
and despite what happens today,

I am proud of each
and every one of you.

These questions are tough, but
they are not aimed to trick you.

So, focus, take your time.

And no matter how hard something looks,

there's always a chance.

You'll have two hours
to complete the test.

No talking.

Keep your eyes on your own tablet.

This time is an accurate test that
will determine your aptitude.

As you know, all grades are final.

Pick up your tablets and begin.

You have one minute remaining.

Time's up, tablets down, test is over.

Okay, here are the results.

Donald Green.

Come with me.

Kellie Jeffries.

This way.

Marcus Langley.

Don't touch me.

Come on.
Don't touch me.

Hands out.
Touch me.

Lane Vic.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

He's on the move, he's on the move.

Hey, get him, back row.

Give him the door.

Carrie Billich.

Come on, it's time to go.

Please stop, please.

And finally.

Peter Strand.

Ellie Harper.

No, no!

Congratulations, you've all passed.

You can go to the rec room now.

Governor, Blake's on the phone.

Oh, good.

Blake, I just heard the
good news, congratulations.

Dad, they took Ellie, she's
going to the thinning.

Oh god.

I'm sorry son.

We have to do something, Dad.

Just make a phone call, you
can say it was a mistake.

You know I can't do that.

Dad.

Son, we all have to obey the law.

No matter how painful it is.

I can't lose her, Dad, I love her.

I'm sorry, son, my hands are tied.

Stay in the line.

Keep going.

Single file.

You, this way.

What are you doing?

Get back in line.

Put that down.

Run, Ellie!

Go, now!

She went down the hall.

Help, help, no, no, no, please, no!

No!

There's nothing to see.

No!

Come on, hurry up, this way.

No, no, no!

Let her go!

Let her go!

No, let her go!

Blake!

Ellie! Ellie! Ellie!

Hey Wade, come on in, boy.

Mr. Glass?

Do you have a minute?

Corinne, watch your brother.

Hi.

I know you told me to stop,

but I made way too much of
this casserole, so please.

Joey, turn it off.

Corinne has to study.

I'm sorry, thank you so much.

Listen, do you have someone
to watch Joey tomorrow?

Because I know of a great day care.

The Consores said they'd
watch him, thank you.

I know it's Corinne's first test.

We're going to be fine.

You know I'm here if you need me.

I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

So, as far as tomorrow?

I wouldn't worry about a thing.

If you're watching this video,
then I am no longer alive.

How many sides does a pentagon have?

Five.

What causes disease?

Bacteria.

How many letters are in the alphabet?

26.

Who loves you?

You do.

You're going to do great.

I love you so much.

I love you, too.

Hey, you ready to go?

Uh huh.

Name, please?

Corinne Michaels.

Okay, thanks.

Good luck, Corinne.

Name, please?

You have a sit down with
Greet the Press at 1pm

directly after the announcement.

Great, what about the speech?

We got the revisions this
morning, they're good.

Did Georgina sign off?

Yes, sir.

You're car will be ready for you at 11.

Hey, knock knock.

What do you want, I'm running late.

Not everything I do
has a grand intention.

I just wanted to say hey.

Hey.

Blake.

I wish there was something
I could have done.

But none of us are above the law.

Not me, not you, not Ellie.

That's a good line.

You should use it in your speech today.

Is there anything else
you want to try out?

Hey.

Hey.

I can't believe this is the last one.

I don't know why I'm telling you this
right now but I'm sweating so much

that my backpack is just wet.

That's gross.

I know you don't stress
out about this stuff

because you're a genius or whatever,
but, you gotta be a little bit relieved.

I mean, think about it,
this is the last time

you have to worry about grades forever.

Not exactly.

You know you don't have to
hang out with me, it's okay.

Oh, really, sweet.

Did I get you?

No, you do this everyday.

Oh, well, do I do this everyday?

'Ello, do I look British?

Do I look like a British person?

Out of the way, bitches.

Wade Freeman, all star
quarterback, represent!

How the hell is that guy still here?

Maybe he's smart.

Is this your phone?

Here you go.

Oh, dude, oh here you go, I'm sorry.

Aw man, you're definitely
getting thinned.

Go fetch, bitch.

Closeted smart.

Commence lock down sequence,
Yes sir.

Warning, lock down is now in progress.

30 seconds until lock down.

Testing to begin in 15 minutes.

Warning, lock down is now in progress.

Excuse me, Governor Redding?

Increased security
demonstrations in Moscow.

Sir, I think you're gonna
want to take a look at this.

It's your son.

Good morning, class.

Good morning, Miss Cole.

Now, before we begin, I'm going to
show you a really special video

before you take your first test, okay?

This is planet Earth, our home.

See how happy she is?

Well, she wasn't always so happy.

You see, not so long ago, the
Earth wasn't feeling so well.

First, she got too hot.

Then, the oceans started to rise,

leaving less room on the
land for Earth's friends,

and with less land and
more and more people,

there was just not enough
room for everybody.

Luckily, boys and girls
from all over the world

got together and came up
with some very cool ways

to eliminate five percent of
their population annually.

You okay, Miss Cole?

Everything all right?

Because if you are not up for it, we
can have someone else come down here.

No, I'm fine.

Just need a minute.

Some places
say goodbye to their oldest.

Others only let mommies
and daddies have one baby.

In America, what if only the smartest
boys and girls got to live here?

That way, there's enough to go around.

And America could be
the best country again.

Isn't that neat?

Now, all kids from 1st
grade til 12th grade

get to take the 10-241 test to
help planet Earth feel great.

'Kay, now, it's time for everyone
to pick up your tablets, okay?

You have a very exciting test
today, just like we practiced.

These questions are hard, but
if you take your time, and focus,

remember there's always a chance.

Okay, pick up your tablets and begin.

Good luck.

If you're watching this video,
then I am no longer alive.

Today, I will be filling
in enough incorrect answers

to definitely fail my 10-241 examine.

My dad wants to stand by this system.

He's gonna have to stand by a system
that put his own son to death.

I want him home now.

Sir, we can't...
I want my son home now!

Testing's already begun, the
school's on complete lock down.

God damnit, god damnit!

Sir, they're ready for you.

Take a walk.

This is Mason King.

Yes, Nathan.

I don't know this one.

Can you help me?

Sorry, I can't.

Just do your best, okay?

Okay.

Time's up, tablets down, test is over.

If I call your name, I want you
to stand up and follow the leader.

We're gonna play a song
while we grade the test.

Nicole Chung.

No, no!

Get off me.

Mark Salazar.

Come with me.

Sarah Foster.

No, no, no!

No, no, please no, don't, no!

Congratulations, the
rest of you passed.

And lastly.

Laina Michaels.

What?

Come on, it's time to go.

Class dismissed.

Is he safe?

The transfer is complete.

Everything is in order, governor.

Mason, I appreciate your discretion.

As always, I need the word
from you to make it official.

Are we approved to
commence the thinning.

You are approved.

Yes, sir.

Good.

Good, are you ready?

Time to sell the dream.

Officer, wait, I'm Kendra
Birch, I'm Laina's teacher.

Laina's the best student I've ever had.

I'm finding it very difficult to
believe that she failed the exam.

Maybe there was a
problem with her tablet?

Do something, please?

Make it right.

Chang, there's a
teacher in the west corridor

who thinks there's a mistake
with a student's test.

Please advise.

What's the name of the student?

Michaels, Laina Michaels.

Look up, Michaels.

First name, Laina.

There's no mistake, proceed, and
don't hold up the line again.

No, I can't.

There's always a chance.

Get the hell out of here.

Let's go, move out.

Hey, congratulations, you made it!

Frank Halloran, EG Electric.

Aren't you Governor Redding's son?

I'd like to talk to
you about your future.

Hey, Clare!

Come on.

Thata boy.

Thata boy, Kellan.

When my grandfather
started at Server Global,

he only worked with
people he could trust.

And I can tell you, today, that he
would trust no one more than my friend

and the leader of the great state
of Texas, Governor Dean Redding!

Thank you, Georgina.

Thank you.

Thank you, thank you.

What a great day in Texas!

Being governor of this great
state for the past six years,

we've accomplished some
pretty incredible things.

We balanced the budget.

We even had a little bit
of change left to spare.

We cracked down on crime by 26%, and
above all, we are number one in education

in the entire United States of America.

Move down the line.

Move down the line.

Our world is crowded.

We had to look facts square in the eye.

You must be really proud.
And make some hard decisions.

We had to collectively decide, what
kind of world do we want to live in?

25 years ago, America was in trouble.

Prepare for decontamination.

Remove all clothing.

There are those that say
the thinning is barbaric.

Well, I ask you, is it barbaric
to be leading in innovation?

Is it barbaric to be the number one
most informed and educated population

in 196 countries?

Is it barbaric to be the best?

If you don't work, if you don't
support our great society,

then you are living off the system.

That is a parasite.

And do you know what
we do with parasites?

We wash them out.

Today's average student

is yesterday's valedictorian.

Tell that to Vermont.

Tell that to Oregon.

We introduced competition
in the classroom

and the results speak for themselves.

Put these on now.

Our great country has many
challenges still ahead.

And with your help,

we can take the good
things we've done in Texas

and lead the rest of America
into an even greater tomorrow.

Sir, please, help me.

You know, you
shouldn't be in the hallway.

This hour, this minute,

this moment.

I have looked inside myself

and in front of the people
of the great state of Texas.

No, no!

I came here to declare my candidacy

for president of the
United States of America.

Stay in your seat.

Hey, back to the chair.

Remain seated.

Sit down!

No!

Get down!

Hey you, sit down!

Now!

Get them in control!

System is down,
commence containment mode.

Send Victor Woods directly
to the control room.

We need a full patch of
the electrical system.

Copy that.

Victor Woods,
report to the control room.

Everybody stand back, stand back.

Uh, Victor Woods, thanks.

We've had a minor power outage.

Nobody leave this room
until further notice.

What are they doing out of the chairs?

Some of the restraints shorted
during the power outage.

But we got it under control.

Have you done a head count?

Sir, the door's locked.

There's no way they could have.

This isn't a discussion.

When's the power back?

Power's about 30 away.

The cameras are gonna
need a separate patch.

Just get it done.

Hey!

What are you doing down here?

It's about time.

I called for you 10 minutes ago.

What?

I'm Miss Birch.

I teach 10th to 12th grade.

Wait, why are you wearing...

I just saw a student
go down that stairwell.

What's the count?

There's one unaccounted for.

You lost a student.

I don't know how she got out.

She?

Her name is Laina Michaels.

And where is she?

Blake?

Lauren?

You failed the test?

It's Laina, and no.

There's no way I failed that test.

What are you doing here?

Didn't you pass?

I failed the test on purpose.

You did what?

I put my dad between a rock and a
hard place and he moved the rock.

Something's not right.

Come on, I think I know where to go.

Level four breach, level four breach.

Level four breach.

Come on.
Level four breach.

Level four breach.

Hey, hey, come on.

Stay back.

Hey, what the hell's going on?

Everybody stay where you are.

This will all be over soon.

Sir, it's past noon.

We're still in lock
down until this is done.

No one comes in or out.

Parents are already asking
when they'll see their children.

What's the status on
the missing student?

All clear on level four.

I want every teacher brought
to holding room A immediately.

Yes, sir.

Okay.

Where do you want to go?

We need to find where
they keep the tests.

What are you gonna do?

Steal the answers for next year?

Excuse me?

You know, for your
little side business.

Where you sell the answers
to desperate kids for money.

You don't know what
you're talking about.

No, I do.

Innocent kids are killed
to meet a bottom line.

And you found a way to profit off them.

Tell me, Laina, what did you
spend the money on first?

Was it a car?

A nice dress, maybe?

My mom.

We had to figure out a way
to pay for the treatments.

We sold everything we could,
but, it still wasn't enough.

I'm not proud of what I did.

I just didn't know what else to do.

In the end it didn't even matter.

You know, it's funny, every day in school
they teach us how to solve problems.

But none of those answers
are on the real world.

I'm such a dick.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

Thank you for admitting you're a dick.

I'm sorry, too.

I just always liked you and I guess
I was kind of jealous of Ellie.

You like me?

Liked, past tense.

Now, can you help me?

Um, yeah, I can get
us to the control room

but with the power out
there's not much we can do.

Right.

Excuse me.
Sorry.

We can follow the network cables,
which will lead to the server room

which runs on reserve power.

Yeah, but don't all computers require

administrator access...
Access card?

Come on.

Yeah, we're doing it.

I'm great, I'm glad we could
finally get this on the calendar.

As am I.

10 seconds, 10 seconds.

Got it, thank you.

Key cards and I.D.s

Thank you for joining us, governor.

Thank you for having me here,
Vince, it's a pleasure to be here.

Governor, I apologize.

We're getting breaking news right now.

There is a story developing at Vista
Point High School, right here in Austin.

We're getting word that the
school is still under lock down.

Now, the test should
have ended hours ago.

Parents are growing concerned

as the school is said to be
holding students indefinitely

with no word as to whether or
not their children are safe.

Now, governor, what do say
to these concerned voters?

Well, while, I don't have any
immediate details on the incident,

I can say that we do have the
best team in the nation on site

and that any problems or confusion
will be resolved shortly.

Somebody tell me what the hell
is going on at that school.

It's worse than we thought.

Show me.

Parents have been
waiting for over two hours

with little to no information
on what has happened

to their children at Vista Point High.

We don't know if our son passed
the test or failed or anything.

This day is hard enough for all
of us and we deserve answers.

This community has been through enough.

No parents of students at Vista
Point have been notified as of yet.

We'll keep you updated
as this bizarre story.

Get King on the emergency line.

Key card and I.D.

This is Mason King.

I'm about to have a thousand
royally pissed off parents

talking to news vans in front
of a school with no power.

I need you to explain to me how
this is even remotely handled.

The cables are nearly patched through.

We'll have power back shortly.

As soon as the power is on, the
thinning continues, you understand?

The eyes of the nation are on us.

We have zero room for failure.

Understood, sir.

We'll find her.

We'll find her.

Find who?

Blake!

Blake!

Blake, breathe.

Blake, breathe!

So that happened.

Go put these on.

So, am I going to have to ask you
or are you going to be a gentleman?

I'll be a gentleman.

Do I need to ask you to be a lady?

Sorry.

It's all good.

I got like a three quick
peeks, so we're even.

Okay, are you decent?

No, but I am wearing clothes.

So I guess we're gonna have to figure out
a way to get back up there, somehow.

You do that, I'm going
to go through here.

What the hell is this?

We passed the test, this is bullshit.

I want to go home.

No one has told us anything.

Are we just supposed to
sit here, indefinitely?

Nobody leaves this room
until we get the all clear.

Don't tell me what to do.

Do you have any idea
who my parents are?

I'm leaving.

Stay back!

Shit.

We can't go down there.

There's too many of them.

We need that card.

I don't think we can get
to the computer without it.

Okay, well, there's
got to be another way.

Where are you going?

This is the one.

All right.

You ready?

Perfect.

Blake, hurry.

Go, go, go.

Blake?

You take care of that.

I'm going to the thinning.

Okay, the major networks
should be here within the hour.

I still don't understand
what you'll say.

The press are like sharks, Ted.

They smell blood,
they'll come swimming.

We just need to give
them some fresh meat.

We found him beat up pretty bad.

You got beat up by a girl.

No, sir, well, yes sir.

It was two of them.

Two girls?

No, it was a male student.

They got the jump on me.

The other said she was a teacher.

What was the teacher's name?

This is ridiculous.

Yes, this whole thing is.

I don't know about you, but I
could use a drink after this.

Me too.

You want to join me for one later?

Sure.

Good.

I have to warn you,

I get a little handsy when I drink.

I can deal with handsy.

So I'll see you after school?

I'll see you then.

'Kay.

Shit.

Kellan.

Come on.

Miss Birch, right?

Let's continue where we left off.

Key card and I.D.

Very well.

Key card and I.D.

I must have dropped it.

No, I don't think so.

Excuse me, this is a mistake.

Everybody out.

I had it two seconds ago.

Where is she?

Who?

I don't know who you're talking about.

I'm broke.

This is the last time
that I'll ask nicely.

Where's Laina?

Oh my god, Laina.

All the information we have as of now
is this morning, approximately 11:45am,

Laina Michaels, a student at Vista
Point High, failed an exam.

She then proceeded to
attack several DPC officers,

injuring two and tragically
killing two others.

Since then, the
students have been moved

to a safe place and are being protected
under the watchful eye of our teachers

until Miss Michaels can be apprehended.

Corinne, do you need a ride home?

I would like
to speak to you as a father.

Come on.

I understand your pain.

My son is in that school as well.

And I will do everything in my power to
bring him and everyone else home safe.

Blake, if you're watching,

I love you son.

This is a trying time for all of us.

I ask for your patience and understanding
as we move to resolve this matter

and bring Miss Michaels to justice.

Wendy, you need to see this.

This was taken from
inside the high school.

Yeah, that's definitely a DPC
guard hitting a passing student.

This doesn't add up.

Who's the source on this?

This footage was sent to us by a student
source inside Vista Point High.

Kellan?

Hello.

All units converge to the server room.

We have her.

Attention.

I was just told to move these students
to the recreation hall immediately.

I didn't hear that.

The students are staying until
Mason King says otherwise.

I was just told to take everyone to the
recreation hall without any hold ups.

So, let's get moving.

Undo the restraints.

No, we do don't do anything without
direct confirmation from Mason King.

Identify yourself now.

Of course.

I'm sorry, let me show
you the confirmation.

He's not a guard!

I have proof.

I passed that test.

Congratulations.

Take her to the thinning.

Holy shit.

Good, get him down.

Get his mask.

I don't care where you pull the
graphics from, we're going live now.

Wendy, this hasn't been
approved by the network.

Karl, it's called
breaking news for a reason.

We're going with this, now.

Three, two.

No, no, not Laina.

Less than an hour ago, Governor
Redding announced a situation

inside Vista Point High involving a
dangerous failed student, Laina Michaels,

said to be wreaking havoc on campus
leaving behind her a trail of terror.

Just moments ago, we received
official documentation

from inside the high school
revealing falsified test scores,

possibly to favor or target specific
students to evade or endure the thinning.

Among those wrongfully
accused of failing the exam,

Laina Michaels, received one of
the highest scores in the school.

Blake Redding, son of
governor Dean Redding

passed the exam, despite having the
lowest score at Vista Point High.

Hi.

I thought you said that you had
the situation under control.

Well, the situation's changing.

Yes it has.

I'm starting to think I
backed the wrong horse.

Congressman Sandoval doesn't come
with these kinds of problems.

Georgina.

Don't Georgina me.

Fix it or you won't have enough
money to run for city comptroller.

This explosive
development calls everything

said today by the governor's
office into question

and reveals a larger scandal at play.

This is bad.

This is bad.

You got to shut it down.

Dean, it's over, you
got to let the girl go.

You need to shut this down, right now.

Goddammit, Dean, are
you listening to me?

It's over.

There's no more moves.

There's one more move.

No, please.

No, no!

Sir, everything is in order.

As always, I need the word
from you to make it official.

Are we approved to
commence the thinning?

Sir, are we approved to
commence the thinning?

No.

There's been a change.

We need to revise the list.

Sir?

That's an order.

All released students are free
to proceed to the recreation hall.

Congratulations, you've passed.

Round them up.

What's going on?

Let's go.

Blake.

Blake what's happening?

It's okay.

No, what's going on?

It's okay, I did this.

Get her out of here.

Blake, no!

Get her out of here!

Put me down, no!

Out of the way.

Wade Freeman, time to go.

Get off me, bro.

Bro, that's my throwing arm, bro.

Do you know who I am?

Wade Freeman, you bitch.

It's all over.

The school-wide lock
down has been lifted

and passing students have been reunited

with their loved ones after what has
been a long, trying day, here in Austin.

As always, our hearts go out to the
families of the failing students

who scored in the lowest percentile.

The head of the DPC, Mason King,
has been taken in for questioning

in connection with the
altered test scores.

I am appalled by the alleged
criminal action of Mr. King.

As of tomorrow morning, I am
appointing a special committee

to fully investigate what
really happened at Vista Point.

If Mr. King is guilty, he will
dearly pay for his unlawful actions.

Earlier reports indicating
a scandal involving

Governor Redding
falsifying test information

were discredited when the
presidential hopeful revealed

his son Blake was among this
year's failing students.

My son, as much as I love him,

is no different than any
of your sons or daughters.

I'm not a hypocrite.

The laws apply to all of us.

It just doesn't make it any easier.

I lost my son today.

But I know in my heart
that he died for a purpose.

All of our fallen students have
made the ultimate sacrifice

in the name of ensuring
a better tomorrow

and in keeping America's future bright.

I'd like to take a moment and
thank them for their courage.

Hold it.

Okay, they're all clear.
