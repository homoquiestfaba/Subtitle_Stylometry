Not at the table, son.

Come on.


Grace first.

You know better.

Father, we are gathered here
to share this food in your name.

Bless this food into our bodies, O Lord.

Bless our hearts
and all that we do, O Lord,

so that we may walk in your name...

[horse neighs]

Who will that be at this time?

I have no idea.

[guns cocking]
[boy whimpers]

Your quarrel is with me.

Let's go outside, take a walk,

[shakily] No.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[footsteps approaching]

[in Spanish] Father Esparza?

I'm here for confessionâ€¦

And the collection.

You know what happens
when you're late with my coins.

[man in English] What possesses a man

to paint a scorpion on his hand?

Excuse me?

A snake,

I understand that.

The Garden of Eden, the Bible, etcetera.

But a scorpion?

Well, that puzzles me.

Who are you?

Just a man.

Here to kill the Scorpion.

Jesus Cortez.

[pensive guitar music playing]


Whatever happened between you and I

must have been a long, long time ago.

No.

No.

[Cortez breathing shakily]

Please.

Please.

Iâ€¦

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.



[somber guitar music playing]


This is a wanted man.

Turn his body in,

I'm worth ten.

Oh, I got to see

Evening, gents. Kindly check your weapons

I'd sooner check my right arm, boy.

Ain't none of them left.

So you found the Scorpion?

Mary, the only thing that mean anything
to me in this world now

is you.

And what about the Nat Love Gang?

Ain't been much of a gang since you left.

Just me, Jim, Bill.

Next time they come around, I'll sort it.


You know, I can almost believe that.

Almost, 'cause you didn't get
the last one, did you?

You can say his name, Mary.

What about Rufus Buck?

Rufus in Yuma
for the rest of his natural life.

For a man like him,
that's worse than death.

As long as that man draw breath,

your spirit is gonna be cursed
and wild as it ever was.


I made things,

I built things,
and I ain't gonna risk all that

just because you decide
to come trottin' back.

"Trottin'"?
Yeah.

[scoffs] Okay, well.
[Mary] Mmm-hmm.

I guess I came to the wrong saloon

'cause I ain't talking

Yep. Things have changed.
I see that.


'Cause that Maryâ€¦

That Maryâ€¦

What was it the Apache called you?


No. That's some bullshit

Oh, y'all was makin' sex?

I apologize.

But what I got to show you can't wait.

Well, well, well.

If it ain't the debonair dipshit himself.

Whoa, easy, Nat.
Listen to what the man got to say first.

So he can tell me
the same stories he been tellin' you?

Why the fuck would I lie?

Rufus Buck is behind bars
for the rest of his life.

[man] He gettin' out.
[cocks gun] How?

Damned if I know.

I just know it's so.

All the gangs are gettin' set
to ride for him again.

Half that take was his. [chuckling]

And you fools took <i>his </i>money.


You think Rufus Buck

Now get out of here.

You're rude.

I might actually enjoy
inflicting violence on you.

But who knows?

Maybe you'll win.

See my point?

Now, step aside so that we may conclude
our business here without further ado.

All right, everybody...

Stop right there.

No.


Put the weapon down, boy.

Or we kill everybody on this train.

I said put the gun down.

It's okay.

Are there any more soldiers on that car?

There are.

Exactly how many?

Thirty.

I said open the damn door.

Here we are.

I imagine you have
all your artillery aimed at the door.

I'd like to inform you
that in front of that door

lies one of your very own troops.

Any bullets coming through that door
will hit him first, okay?

State your name, criminal.

Oh, I'm not a criminal, sir, um,
but my name is Cherokee Bill.

What's your name?

My name is Officiant of the Goddamn Law.

You let that soldier go immediately.

Leave this train now
and no one will be hurt.

Oh, that sounds like fear talking,
Mr. Officiant of the Goddamn Law.

And we done already hurt a couple people.

You're just going to let us
get away Dred Scott free?

State your purpose, bastard.

Also, I'm not a bastard.

But you've got something we want.
We've got a soldier that you want.

Now, I suggest we make a peaceful trade
and everybody lives to see another day.

Sound dandy?
Just let the boy go.

Jake!

[Jake groaning]

I'm okay, Pa!

That's just a flesh wound, sir.

You got ten seconds to put your guns down

And the marshal say,
"Don't nobody come in here gunned up,

or they might could get gunned down."

My badge begs to differ.

Check your gun-belt.

Excuse me.

[ominous string music playing]


So how you plan on taking me in, Marshal?

Staring me to death?

How about just death?

Just a pipe.

You mind?

Never known you to touch it.

Only after I kill a man.

Or before.

I was on the trail
of the Crimson Hood Gang

on account of a bank robbery
in Kansas City.

Turned out somebody got to 'em before me.

You know I don't rob banks, Marshal.

But you rob them that do,
which is all the same to me.

Texas.
What?

I was in Texas
at the time of that robbery.

How you know when it took place?

Whenever any bank robbery took place,
I was in Texas.

Unless, of course,
the robbery took place in Texas.

Way I hear it, some of them boys
with the Crimson Hoods

are part of a new Rufus Buck Gang, Nat.

Rufus in Yuma.

He out. But you knew that already,
didn't you?

Why you sitting here monologuing,
drinking up my whiskey,

when you should be out
rounding up your little deputies?

'Cause he been pardoned, Nat.

Rufus Buck been absolved
of his countless depredations.

Seeing as I've been scouring the terrain
looking for bank robbers and such,

that particular piece of news
failed to reach me.

What they sayin'?

Something about guns, killin'.

Why you let that kid take my gun?
What kinda stupid rule is that?

Should be four guns pointing at...
Shut up, Pickett.

You shoot, he dead.

You miss,

You, come here.

Take these cuffs. Cuff this man.

Go on.

Tell this young buck to back up.

Easy, Jim.

Everybody in here know who I am.

Cherokee Bill, Ms. Smith,
top of the morning to you both.

Mr. Buck, glad to have you
back in Redwood, sir.

Any word on the take
from the Kansas City bank?

The Crimson Hoods took it for $25,000.

But they were ambushed
before they got here.

Everybody knows
it's suicide to take from us.

Someone obviously disagrees.

Goddamn it. That just put us
right back where we started.

How we supposed to build a Mecca
without any bricks?

take it out of our own bank.

that type of money, Trudy.

We only got a few pennies over $2,500.

What did he say?

[man] 2,500...
I heard you.

[Trudy] Wiley.
[Cherokee Bill] Yeah.

[Rufus exhales]

[tense orchestral music playing]

What's up, little man?

You wanna see something?
[boy] Yeah.

Watch this now.
Don't take your eyes off it.

Oh, it's still there! [laughs]

Rufus Buck.

Look at you.

Relic of yesteryear with nothin'.

And you think you can roll into my town
and take what belong to me?

Who the fuck you think I am, huh?

Ain't nobody scared of you
and ain't nobody runnin'.

I'm a sinister motherfucker too.

One click of my finger and you disappear.

So I suggest you leaveâ€¦

Before I finish my steak.

And if you even think about sticking...

Come in.

What is it, Carson?

Sheriff, Mr. Buck wants
to see you out front.

Tell that man

It wasn't a request.

you can hold onto this place when it hit?

Kill meâ€¦

And you'll have nothing.

[song ends]

[door unlocks]

[cocks rifle]

You coulda taken these off a while back.

Yep.

Tell me something.
How you know Rufus will be in Redwood?

from them Crimson Hoods.

That's where he'll be.

Now you teaming up
with a marshal to bring him in.

I ain't bringing him in.
I'm bringing him down.

And we ain't teaming up, old man.

Your life's expendable, Marshal.
My gang's ain't.

Shit, since we're out here,
I oughta tell youâ€¦

I was fixin' to kill youâ€¦

When you and your fellas brought in Rufus.

A lot of men be fixin', son.

They always seem to die
before they get the job done.

Just for the recordâ€¦

I took Rufus in alone.

[pensive orchestral music playing]


I figured you'd be halfway
to Fort Smith by now.

You can put that gun down, Marshal.
This ain't a ambush.

You, on the other hand,
might wanna keep yours handy.

Do you think I'm stupid enough

to fall for that bullshit
y'all pulled in my saloon?

I don't want you mixed up in this no more.

Then you shoulda told me so.

I must confess
to some raw feelings myself.

This ain't no road
to ask a friend to travel.

Now you take that money
we took off them Crimson Hoods

and you buy that ranch
you always blabbing about. Hmm?

That's mighty generous of you,
but that ain't how this gang work.

Take stays in the usual place, ready
to be shared three ways when we come back.

Ain't no coming back from this.

Now get out of here.

All of you. This ain't your fight.

You take on the Devil himself, you gonna
need more than you and the marshal.

I seen the Devil,
and Rufus Buck ain't him.

Devil's white.


You got a reason you wanna die, Jim?

Outside of you saving me from this?

Besides, Monroe said
Cherokee Bill run with Rufus.

Every time I speak on my speed,

a motherfucker wanna pull
Cherokee Bill out they ass.

I'ma put a end to that argument
once and for all.

Like they say in the <i>Book of Clarence,</i>
"No man out-speed me."

Out-speed ain't a word,
and Clarence ain't no book.

I'm hopin' Cherokee put a bullet
in your ass just to shut you up.

Hey.
You left these on my wall, Mr. Love.

Figured we going after villains,
you'll need 'em.

Obliged.

[emotional string music playing]

What y'all waiting around for?

You think destiny is comin' to you?

Hyup! Go!

["The Harder They Fall" playing]

Yeah. I know.
[horse whinnies]

Go ahead.

<i>â™ª Wahala they go

[music fades out]



Everybody out there?

Just about.

[Rufus exhales]

How could you do it?

Leave all of this to Wiley?

If you were runnin' Redwood,

who woulda kept the operation goin'?

Who else woulda kept
all them gangs in line?

Look, I know that Wiley got his ways,
but he was loyal once.

Loyalty is a virtue, Rufus.

Till it ain't.

You loyal to me?

See these folk here?

Either they can't see it
or they don't want to.

But I believe in what you're doing.

This place can be
the promised land for us.

And as long as that so, ain't nothing
I won't do to see it through.

You tell them.


A new day is dawning.

As by now you have doubtless learned,

the territory will officially
open up for settlement.

Now they say everything we own
is gonna stay our own.

But you know as well as I do
how much that's worth.

See, your land,
your businesses, your homes

has all been promised
to the highest bidders

by your one-time sheriff, Wiley Escoe.

Now, Mr. Buck can prevent this
from happening.

But in order for us to do that,
it's necessary that we levy a tax.

[crowd muttering]
At what cost to us?

$50,000.
[man] Ooh.

You could scrape every penny
from every living soul in this town,

and it wouldn't come near to that.

You got us between a rock
and a hard place.

How long you been alive in this country?

A rock and a hard place
is what we call Monday.

I've heard of Rufus Buck.

How bad a man he is.

But he got himself
thrown in jail once before,

and I reckon
he'll be back there again soon enough.

When he is,
maybe I'll come back to this town.

'Cause I ain't paying shit.

You think I made Redwood for myself?

To what end?

Redwood ain't a hiding place,
'cause I don't hide.

It ain't a dream.

I don't dream.

You know what it is?

It's an example.

It's an exampleâ€¦

For others to follow.

And youâ€¦

You are an enemy of progress.

[crowd murmuring]

Please. Please.

I got a family.
What's your name?

James.

[crowd gasps]

[body thuds]

[menacing orchestral music playing]


[breathes deeply]

Now, how much?

How much can be gathered?

Ten thousand.

Maybe 15,
if every last cent can be squeezed.


Ain't nobody leave town
until we collect it all.

And if you fail to comply,

you and everything you love will burn.

[crowd gasps]

[gun cocking]

I ain't got nothin' to rob.

But I got somebody to shoot.

Step down.


Wiley Escoe.

Bass Reeves.

Fuck.

Redwood crawling with gunmen.

Rufus came with 12 and took six of mine.

Who knows how many he got by now.

I don't believe a thing this man sayin'.

He a scout.

I say we kill him.

And we take the rest of them teeth.

You ever shot a sheriff, boy?

A mayor?

Little harder than shootin' regular folk.

And I'm both.

'cause Rufus don't like loose ends.

Law don't find a man like Rufus Buck
unless you got inside information.

Ain't that right, Wiley?

If I had my way, you'd be right up
under the jail next to Rufus.

But you cut yourself a deal,
wound up wearing a badge instead.

You got your reasons
you want Rufus gone, and I got mine.

Ain't the enemy of my enemy my friend?

Rufus tryin' to save Redwood.
But for that, he need money.

And that's one thing he ain't have.

All right, look here.
You made a deal with the Devil.

Now he come to collect.

You rest up,

but be gone before sunup.

Or it's gonna go from bad to badder.
You hear?


Marshal.

Marshal. Marshal.

All them tricks'll get you killed, son.


I'm faster than any weapon.
You can trust in that.

I seen faster.

All right. Where?

In the mirror.

[Jim and Pickett laugh]

Negro said, "In the mirror."


I rather ride into a gun battle
on a dark horse over a golden stallion.

Fuck that mean?
Shiny shit get shot.

You gonna shoot me?


What you think about that, lawman?

I think y'all gonna die.

[Nat singing] <i>â™ª And away with the wind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª As her garden grows â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hold those flowers close â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For away with the wind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She goes â™ª</i>

I'll be back with information by sunup.

Information from where?

Redwood.

You know we can't trust Wiley's word.

Someone's got to get the lay of the land
before we make our next move.

Yeah, Mary, but that somebody
ain't got to be you.

Every gunhand
in the territory's gonna recognize you

the second you hop off your horse.

Same with Bill and Beckwourth.

In case you forgot,

your face more famous than all of ours
put together, Stagecoach Mary.

Got it up on advertisements
for that saloon of yours

from here to Texas.

Which is why I can
ride into town in plain sight.

Everybody knows I'm buying saloons.

Rufus need money. I'ma make him an offer
on Trudy Smith's place...

Mary, what in my character
makes you think I'll allow that?

I'm not asking for your permission.

All right.

Then Iâ€¦ I guess
I'll just be asking you for yours.

Since you'll never let
a man give you away,

I just have to ask you direct.

[gentle guitar music playing]

That's the ring my father gave my mother.

I was gonna give it to you
back in Douglas.

But you didn't.

I am now.

I used to hate feeling helpless over you.

Those days are over now.

Maryâ€¦

When the dust settles,
we gonna go our separate ways, for good.

[Mary inhales]

But not till the dust settles.
I'm here till then.

[romantic string music playing]

See you sunup.

["Black Woman" playing]

Are you a resident of Redwood, ma'am?

You don't own a gun

{\an8}Well, this gun say
answer the damn question.

Well, this gun don't talk.

[guns cocking]


Ghastly Gertrude Smith.

I prefer Treacherous Trudy myself,
but I'll take it.

What brings you to my town?

I heard Rufus Buck was back.

News travels fast.
[man chuckles]

I have an offer he might wanna hear about.

Well, any offer you got,

you can make it to me.


I don't do business with the help.

Give me that shit.

Lead the way, Treacherous Trudy.

[singer humming]

Speak your piece.

I assume you know who I am.

I assume you know who I used to run with.


Those days are over for me anyhow,

but I didn't get to be
Stagecoach Mary Fields

without having my ears to the ground

and my ears tell me you just lost
25 thou that was coming your way.

rivals your nerve...

Allow me the latitude of completion.

My saloon in Douglas is boomin'.

Bought me another one in the Elks,
and I got a restaurant in Cascade too.

For the sum of all that,
I could take this one off your hands.


The mere mention of my name
brings forth good business

to any establishment attached, whereas,

with all due respect,
but the name Rufus Buck instils fear.

We know who you are.

You walkin' into my town
with that proposal is risky.

The kind of risk a woman such as yourself
wouldn't tie herself to

unless there was
a whole lot more at stake.

See, I don't believe in coincidence,

like you just gonna walk in here

right after the Crimson Hoods
get ambushed with my money.

What are you thinking?

[Mary grunts]


You must have forgot
whose name is on the door.

[man chuckles]

Another round.

We havin' a party, y'all. Come on.

[Nat humming
"Away with the Wind She Goes"]


All right.

So you still sayin'
you don't know nothin' about that money

and you done come here alone?

That's right.

You done rode all the way over here
to get yourself killed.

And for what?

For love?

Love is the only thing worth dying for.

But you wouldn't know anything about that.

You know,

I had a sister named Mary.

She was pretty, strong-willed, like you.

She died of polio when I was 11.

Always was in pain,
but she'd never let me see her cry.

Mmm.

There's this girl called Hope lived by us.

Big fat kid,
always picking on the smaller kids.

Obviously out of jealousy.

But she ain't never fuck with me though.

She hated Mary with a passion,

always teasing her
about how thin and frail she was.

Then one day,

Hope walkin' by our house,

apple in one hand, blade in the other.

She decided to throw the apple
across the street at Mary,

and it hit my sister in the head
and knocked her out of balance.

She fell down the steps.

Broke her ankle.

And now thatâ€¦

That was the first and only time
I physically seen my sister cry.

And there was Hope standing there
laughin' her ugly fuckin' face off.

My daddyâ€¦

He got home,

he took off his belt, and he beat <i>me</i>
for not protecting my sister.

He lashed me
until my whole body went numb.

Then

he went to Hope house
to do the same thing to her.

When he got there, he saw her whole family
standin' on the side of the house,

all of 'em screamin' and cryin',

and there was Hopeâ€¦

Iyin' on the floor in a pool of blood.

Somebody had slit her throat.

Killed her with her own knife.

Daddy was speechless.

He ain't said a word to me
when he came home.

The next day,

he sent me to live with my grandparents.

And then the next time I seen my sister,

she was laying in a coffin.

Disease had killed her.

I'm sorry your sister had to suffer.

I admire her bravery.

But you get no words from me.

You know,

I actually admire <i>your</i> bravery.

But I'm afraid the outcome
is still the outcome.

Hope

must die.

[Mary continues struggling]

But not yet.



[breathing heavily]

[Mary grunts]

Leave her out here in the street
so everybody can see her.

No one come to collect her 'fore sunup,
put a bullet in her head.


Looks like we don't
have to wait that long.

[dub music playing]

Whoever die first, right?

Whoever die first.
[Jim] Mmm-hmm.

Get her up.

"Whoever die first"?

Now, what kind of dumb-ass saying is that?

You two trying to get shot out here?

Nat Love. How predictable.

You predict my friend Bill Pickett
aiming at your bowler cap?

You'll be dead
before your boys get their aim.

And you die right after.

But your boss won't see
one red cent of that money.

My boss?

Where is he?

Where is who?


I'm speakin' English, yeah?

Sound like English to me.
[Nat] Mmm-hmm.

Where's Rufus Buck?


Ooh-hoo.

Bass.


If I'd known you were switchin' sides,
I'da asked you to come join us.

You here for your damsel in distress?

You don't look hard of hearing.

So I'ma ask you again.

Where's Rufus Buck?

Well, clearly, you don't know me.

Tell your men to go,

but you stay,

and maybe your damsel
will live a little longer.

Marshal.


You're pretty though.


Ah, take her ass back in there.
Yes, ma'am.

Gonna get me a drink.


That the quick draw
I hear tell about, Cherokee Bill?

I hear you so fast
that your opponents ain't got time to draw

before you put two in they back.

No, that ain't me.

I'm the Cherokee Bill that shoots men
in the mouth that talk too much.

[Jim scoffs]

I'll make it easy for you, then.

You draw first.

[tense string music playing]

That what you think this is?
"Who the quickest draw in the West?"

All comes down
to who fast and who ain't, right?

No, it all comes down
to who's alive and who's dead.

[tense string music building]

Trudy, I'm gonna get me
something to drink.

Good night.

[music ends]
[laughter]

Hey, hey, drink, my ass, man.

I practiced that standoff all night.
Jim.

[Jim] You're not about to walk away.
[Nat] Get out of here.

No, nobody...
[Nat] Get out of here, Jim.

[Jim] That chicken...
[Bass] It ain't the time.

Okay. Okay.

[suspenseful orchestral music playing]


I said march!
March.

Hup, two, three, four.

[both grunting]

[grunting continues]

That's enough.

[breathing heavily]



[breathing heavily]

[door opens]

[door closes]

They beat you bad?

I'ma kill 'em all.

[door opens]

[man whistling
"Away with the Wind She Goes"]

[footsteps approaching]

[whistling continues]



He said, "I am driven towards an end
that I do not know."

"As I reach it,

as I shall become unnecessary,

an atom shall suffice to shatter me."

"Until then, all forces of humankind
can do nothing to stop me."

That's a man who knew exactly who he was.

Most importantly,

he knew that
his time would come to an end.

Cut him down.


[object clattering]

You know whyâ€¦

I gave you that scar?



No, I gave you that scar so I can know
your face when you come back to me.

Nat Love,

the outlaw who robs outlaws,

the angel of death who hunts down those
who trespass against him with no mercy.

I know who you are.

And I see the line that you won't cross.

[somber song playing]

See, I know what's on the other side.

Apologize for the beating.


It was more of an indication
for what Ms. Fields might see

if we fail to come to terms.


You will return the money
you stole from me by Friday noon.

Not a moment later.

And you will add $10,000 on top of that.
We'll call that interest.

Somethin' funny?

Ooh, shit, howâ€¦
how you reckon I'ma get that?

You're gonna rob a bank.

Nat Love is gonna rob a bank.

In the meantime, here's a little token
of my appreciation in advance.

Go ahead, open it.

I expect my money on Friday.

All of it.


If that money ain't in Rufus' hands
in three days, Mary'll die.

we talking about anyway?


Maysville?

That's a white town.

Yeah, which is why
they gonna have $10,000 in their bank.

It's crazy.

are all types of confused.

I mean, Pickett, I agree. That's crazy.

But, Nat, I also agree with you
telling the marshal

that we gonna do that shit anyways.

That's some true outlaw shit.

We outlaws, ain't we?
[Nat] Ain't no "we," Jim.

Not after that shit you pulled in town
nearly got us all killed.

I had that.

you took from the Crimson Hoods.

Pickett, kid, you comin' with me.

If Rufus Buck want that bank took,
why don't he send his own men?

This way he clean, see?

I gotta go in barefaced as day,

a freshly minted bank robber, face up
on wanted posters all over the territory.

They'll be on you like flies on shit
before you open the door.

Yep.

I said <i>I</i> had to be recognized.

Go ahead.

[Jim stifling laughter]


For Mary.

Whoo! Hoo!

Close shave.

Close fucking shave!

I thought I was
falling for a fella for a little bit.

That's why I didn't say nothing.

Well, I ain't the only one. I can'tâ€¦

I can'tâ€¦ It wasn't just me.
It wasn't just me.

It was just you, Jim.

[Nat] Allow me.
[grunts]

What's your real name?

Cuffee my real name.

Name I was born with?

Cathay Williams.

You walk worse than you ride, Cathay.

Mr. Love, my momma always told me
to respect my elders,

so I'm not gonna say what I'm thinking.

That's all right. I can read your mind.

Then I'm sorry you had to hear that.

[indistinct chattering]

[chattering stops]

Go ahead.

Go ahead, honey.

[tense string music playing]

[tense string music building]


[clears throat]

I'd like to make a withdrawal.


Ooh.

[laughing loudly]

Whatâ€¦

You have to have an account, ma'am.

And, well, I'd recommend a bank
in Jericho or maybe Redwood for that.

Oh.

I'm not talking about
that kinda withdrawal.

I'm talk...

I'm talking aboutâ€¦

Talking about that kind.

[exhales shakily]

[suspenseful drumming builds to crescendo]

Attaboy.

I ain't like my partner.

He don't wanna shoot nobody,
but all of a sudden, I'm of a mind to.

Now open the fuckin' gate.

[suspenseful drumming]

Think I'm funny now?

What you lookin' at?

Get all the customers over there.

Get 'em over there!
Okay, okay.

Everyone, please, this way quickly.
You too. Move!

[rapid drumming]

Times have changed, ain't they?

They say robbing banks is hard work.

[suspenseful drumming]

That's a lie. Robbing banks is easy.

The hard part is doing it without killing.

So, what'll it beâ€¦

Mr. Manager?

[manager sighs]

Good man.

Come on. Giddyap. Go.

Come on, come on.

Okay, sir.

Nat Love.

[siren wailing]

[song continues]

[song ends]

Don't even look like much.

Ain't what it look like.
It's what it can buy you.

Rufus won't let Mary go
once he gets that money.

Yeah, I know it.

He'll kill her,
let me go, so's I carry that hurt with me.

So what, we just went through
all that trouble for nothin'?

Now we got something he want.

And that's it?

Gonna have to be.

[wagon approaching]

You can be all hasty
and shoot me now if you want,

or you can wait to see
what I brought with me first.

[Nat whistles] Ooh.

all across these hills.

Enough for a small army.

Don't nobody take what I got coming to me.

Not even the Devil himself.


Y'all best reconcile yourselves
with that fact.

Man or devil,

this gonna be
Buck's last day amongst the living.

Afternoon.

I would ask you to run
go fetch your superior,

but that'd be like asking you
to run go fetch your daddy.

It could be anybody, right?


You know,

I'm willing to bet my right arm

I've got a higher body count than yours.

[tense drumming]

That'd be a bad bet, son.

I fancy that song or whatever it was
you was whistling there.


That our money?

[clicks tongue] Uhâ€¦

Walk with me.

Hey, justâ€¦ just walk with me.

Keep an eye on this, Angel.
[Angel] Mmm-hmm.


You know they call your boss
the Devil hisself?

Even the Devil needed money, right?

So being as how we are
in possession of that moneyâ€¦

let me dictate the terms of engagement.

[people screaming]
[horses neighing]

What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that, old man?

Is that the right arm or the left?

Oh man.

Well, now there's usâ€¦

And there's y'all.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

You get a hold of your feisty buddy here.

You got a little rowdy rascal.

Mary.
[Cherokee Bill] Yeah, we'll get to that.

We gonna count this first.
Now, Cherokee.

Or your boss gonna be
one quick draw and $35,000 short.


[tense orchestral music playing]

All right.

Unhitch this horse so's Mary can ride out.

You always move so slow?
[Cherokee Bill] You always talk so much?

[tense orchestral music building]


In the back?

What you think, Beckwourth?

[gun cocking]

Nah, he wouldn't do that

'cause then I would have to put
a bullet in his cranium.

And we'll never know
who the fastest really is now, will we?

[Cherokee Bill]
I gotta hand it to you, boy.

You do know how to make a grand entrance.

[Jim scoffs]

Shit, I didn't even rehearse that one.

You know, quick draw,

Nat Love is a dead man walking.

But you don't have to be.

Why don't you get on your horse,
get your shit,

and go back to
whatever it is you call home?

You know that's impossible.

Count down from five?

Fiveâ€¦

[song ends]

Pick up your guns.


It's the eyes.

Pick 'em up, I said.

[breathing shakily]


he was a good man?

He was.

And my mother was a good woman
before you cut 'em down.

Seems we had a different upbringing.

I don't care how you was raised.

Now pick up your guns and turn around.

I used to watch my father
beat my mother to a pulp

if she overcooked his food.

He cut her up real good
if she undercooked it too.

One day, I decided to intervene,

and he turned his wrath on me.

My father was not a good man.

Not a good man. He was an outlaw.

Robbin' banksâ€¦

He liked to drink.

My mother took a bottle
and cut him to protect me.

He lashed back at her,
and just like that, she was gone.

Then, like the coward he is,

he took everything we had and left,

leaving me with myâ€¦

My mother.

I was ten years old, you knowâ€¦

About the same age you wasâ€¦

When I gave you that scar.

I had to fend for myself,
but I became who I am,

just like you.

As I did, all I could ever think about is
wanting my father to pay for what he did.

I searched for him for years and years,
and I could never find him.

It's like he disappeared
off the face of the earth.

I ain't stop though. I kept lookingâ€¦

Until I did find him.

One dayâ€¦

Io and behold,

there he was,

my father,

a new man.

He was clean now.

[emotional piano music playing]

Sober.

Man of God.

Had a church.

He had a pretty little wife.

And he had a son,

about the age of ten years old,

whose eyes blazed like mine.

[cocks gun]

You're lyin'.

You're lyin'!

["Three and Thirty Years (Opera)" playing]

Killing our father was retribution, but...

<i>My</i> father!

<i>My</i> mother!

But it weren't enough.

Letting you live,

that was the true revenge.

Every sin you made, every bank you robbed,
everybody you killed.

I mean, look at you.

You everything he tried to run away from.

Buck.

Changed his name to "Love."

[inhales shakily]

You a Buck.

You lyin'.

Just like me.

[breathes deeply]

Just like him.

But you better.
You gonna surpass even me becauseâ€¦

I couldn't kill my brother.

Yet here you are about to kill yours.

Nathaniel Buck.

Go on.


Nathaniel Buck.
No.

Take your revenge.

Nathaniel Buck.

[gunshot]
Take your goddamn revenge!

You a Buck.

Nathaniel Buck.

I always kinda wanted to be
