Then what, huh?

Who's gonna be

[ Metal rattles ]

[ Chuckles ]

You put that sign out

You spell it right?

I don't think you did.

You ain't spell

Hell, you ain't ever
do anything right!

Don't you look at my like that!

Remember the last time
someone gave you
any responsibility?

That's right.

You came running to me.

Got your dumb ass
stabbed in the neck!

Got your car stolen.

Who knows where
your goddamn family's at!

[ Metal rattles ]
[ Laughing ] Oh, yeah!

You walked through

With your tail tucked

to hitch a ride *

[ singing indistinctly ]

* I'm gonna follow mine *

Can you, uh, tell me
how to get to the I-95?

Yeah.

Go South a couple Miles
out of town.

Come across a fork in the road.

There'll be a sign there.

Can't miss it.

Okay, thanks.

Homemade, huh?

Proudly made by yours truly.

How much if I buy two bags?

Them your kids?

Yep.

Tell you what.

You buy two bags...

I'll give you two for free...
On the house.

For the kids.

You got a deal.

Meat's good for the kids.

Makes 'em grow up
big and strong.

You got it.

What's the gold star mean?

[ Gunshot ]

I didn't mean...

Nah.

Just means I marinated
it a little longer.

That's all.

Sounds good to me.

Change?

I ain't got no change.

Okay.

Mmm, yeah, that's good stuff.

[ Chuckles ]

Hey.
[ Chuckles ]

Why don't you have
a little protein there maybe?

Yum, yum, yum.

[ Sighs ] I love my job.

See if I run that

[ Sets down bottle ]

I can imagine him now,
wobbling his fat, little ass
across the road.

Squealing for bloody murder.

[ Imitating squealing ]

Never could catch him, though.

You know I don't mean you

You know I'm just
fucking with you, right?!

Remember that joke I told you?

Child molester, a little kid...
They go walking in the woods.

Little kid's all,
"gee, mister, sure is dark
and scary out here."

Child molester looks
at the kid and says,

"Think it's bad now?
I got to walk out
of here alone!"

I'm just gonna catch
my breath for a minute.

Again?
[ Sighs ]

Really?

Hey, lay off of her.

I'll stay with her.

You just go ahead.

We'll catch up.
[ Chirping continues ]

[ Chirping continues ]

[ Growling softly ]

Here you go.

[ Sighs ]

Thanks.

Oh, no worries.

[ Sighs ]

She's not a bitch
all the time.

I know, but losing
your family...

Doesn't give you the right
to be an asshole to everyone.

I know. I agree.

Just give her some time.

[ Sighs ]

I don't know.
I just...

[ Sighs ]

I think she just feels
responsible for Lauren now,
you know?

[ Sighs ]

Maybe.
[ Sighs ]

[ Chirping continues ]

[ Clanging in distance ]

Wait, you see that?

[ Sighs ]

What? [ Sighs ]

Wait, I'll be right back.

Just stay here.

What? Wait. No.
No, no, no.
I'll be right back.

[ Sighs ] God damn it.

I don't know.

I think we should wait
for the girls.

Well, can't we wait inside?

I mean, it's really hot
out here.

[ Sighs ]

Fine.

Well, this was a great idea.

Yeah, this is why
you should never listen to me.

Mm-hmm.
I don't even listen
to myself half the time.

$2.99... awesome deal.

They can keep the change.

Maybe they can use it
to clean this place up
'cause let's face it.

They can fucking use it.

[ Piano key plays ]

Oh, you should play
something scary.

[ Ominous piano music playing ]

Actually, on... on second
thought, y-you shouldn't even
touch that.

[ Sighs ] I know.

It's like layers of dirt.

[ Sighs ]
It's a fucking
shithole in here.

I mean, literally...

Lauren, Lauren.
I think that there is shit
on the floor over there.

Lauren, Lauren,
Lauren, Lauren.

Hi.

This is... this is a really
interesting store.

So, is this like
a... a resort town
or something, like a...

New frontier land or...

Just rustic?

[ Spits ]

Okay, well...

Sorry to bother you.

We are...

Just gonna go.

And have a good day.

Okay?

My... my $5.

[ Doors rattling ]

What about my $5?

Fuck your $5.

[ Gunshot ]

Oh, shit.

[ Chuckles ]

Yeah, I don't think so.

You don't play this right...

You're gonna be picking up
your girl's brain matter
out of the dirt.

Now you turn around now.

Nice and slow.

I'm kind of mad
at the both of you right now.

We're gonna have a conversation
about it a little later on.

You ain't gonna
be too happy about it.

[ Sighs ]

What?

You don't like my store?

No, no, that's...
shut up, bitch.

I ain't talking to you.

Why you leave my store?

We, uh, we just
have to be somewhere.

I don't like you much.

I'm sorry.

Why the fuck you sorry for?

I don't know.
You just seem up...
shut up, bitch!

You're sorry 'cause you're weak!

Ain't gonna be much
fun to break.

[ Spits ]

[ Sighs ]

Anyway,
enough of the bullshit.

We're gonna go
for a little walk.

Move it!

Move it!

[ Sighs ]

[ Cicadas chirping ]

[ Chirping continues ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

Wake up, bitch!

[ Breathing heavily ]

Look at the show
I put on for you.

[ Laughs ]
You got a front row seat.

But I have to admit,
there is one bit of good news.

[ Sighs ] What?

You only die once.

Ugh.

[ Laughs ]

[ Crying ]

I'll tell you what.

That ain't gonna happen
anytime soon.

[ Inhales sharply ]

Why are you doing this?

Oh, you can't understand.

Just because I can.

[ Crying ]

'Cause I enjoy
other people's suffering.

Watching
someone else's pain gets me off.

[ Laughs ] Listen to 'em scream.

[ Chuckles ]

Knowing that I have
a power of a God!
What do you want?!

What are you gonna do to us?!

We're gonna fuck you up!

What do you think
I'm gonna do to you...
make you pancakes?!

God damn it,
I don't like pancakes.

Stupid fucking women!

You belong in the kitchen.

[ Crying ]

No, no!
[ Laughs ]

Aah!
[ Laughs ]

Stop it! No!

Oh, come on.
No, no!

Oh, yeah.
No!

[ Laughing ] Oh!

Come on! [ Laughing ]

Come on! Oh, come here!
No, stop it! Leave me alone!
Please!

Come here!

[ Laughs ]
Aah!

Please!
[ Laughs ]

Yeah!
Oh, no! Stop!

Get off me!
Stop! No!
Ooh! [ Laughs ]

Get your hands off of her!

[ Whimpering ]

[ Laughs ]
Please don't hurt her!

[ Screaming ]
Please don't
fucking touch her, please!

Mmm!

[ Crying ]
Oh, you'll get
your turn, bitch!

You're next!
[ Breathing heavily ]

This one's first.
[ Whimpering ]

[ Chuckles ] Oh.

[ Laughing ] Oh, feisty!

[ Laughing ]

Take me instead, please!
I can bring you people!

[ Breathing heavily ]

I saw people when I was hiking!
Please, I can get them!

[ Breathing heavily ]

No!

No!
How many?

[ Breathing heavily ]

Four.

Four.

[ Crying ]

There are four.

Can't we just make
some sort of deal?

[ Breathing heavily ]

Please!

Please, there were four girls!

It's four girls!

Oh, you're holding out
on me, bitch, huh?!

You didn't tell me
they were girls.

[ Sighs ] I can get 'em.

Tell you what.

Bring me three bitches for her.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Okay, I'll try.

No, there ain't no tryin'!

You bring me three bitches
for her ass!

We got no deal!

Okay, okay!

I'll do it.

Don't do it, Sarah!

Don't give this asshole
what he wants!

[ Laughing ]
Oh, poor little girl.

[ Laughs ]

I can get 'em.

I'll do it.

[ Sighs ] You have a deal.

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Sighs ]

[ Crying ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Whimpers ]

Now you listen real good.

You better come back.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Or you're gonna wish
I just had my way with her.

[ Breathing

[ Crying ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

Hey, numbnuts.

Throw her the gun.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Jesus Christ.

You're gonna need that.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Oh!

[ Laughs ]
Oh, now.

[ Chuckles ]
Feeling lucky, bitch?

[ Breathing heavily ]

I see it in your eyes.

[ Sniffs ]

I'll dance with you if you want.

[ Laughing ]

Let's go, bitch!

Let's do this!

Thinking about going
to the sheriff station?

You got 30 minutes!

Nearest sheriff station's
an hour away.

You do the math.

Thirty minutes... i blow a hole
in your girl's skull.

[ Breathing heavily ]

What are you
waiting for, bitch?!

Let's go.

Come on!

[ Door opens ]

[ Door closes ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

Please, please, just let me go.

I'll do anything you want.

Please.

I won't tell anyone
where you are.

Just please!

Hey.

What's going on?

I-is this...

Is this some kind of joke?

No, it's not a fucking joke!

Now I need you to come with me!

What... what are you
talking about?

I said I need you
to fucking come with me!

So get off your asses and do it!

Hey, guys, what's going on?

[ Gasps ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

Now, I'm not fucking kidding!

I really don't want to hurt you,
so please don't make this
any harder then it has to be!

Okay.
Now we're gonna
walk down this path.

And I don't want to hear
a fucking word!

If you run, I swear to God
I will shoot you, so please
don't make me do that.

Okay.

It's okay.

Let's go!

Move.

[ Sighs ]

[ Sighs ]

How's it feel to make
a deal with the devil?

[ Laughs ]

Go get 'em, boy.

[ Cicadas chirping ]

Come on, we can't stop here.
We have to keep going.

What have you done?

I just saved your life!

By sending three innocent
people to their deaths!

I wasn't gonna leave you
there to get raped and murdered

By those assholes,
not to mention the fact
that I was gonna be next!

What do you think
they're gonna do to those girls?

There's nothing else
I could've done!

God, this is so wrong!

[ Sighs ]

What, I should've
just left you there?

Yeah.
Yeah, that would've been
the right decision.

You don't get
to make that decision.

Yes, I do.
No, you don't.

We just lost mom and dad.

I can't loose you, too.
I can't!

That is not fair.

You know, I have to live
with your decision, too.

I saved your life!

I saved both of our lives!

I saved us!
They didn't do
anything to deserve this!

And we did?!

I'm sorry, but I did what
I had to do to protect
what's left of my family!

By sending
three innocent girls to die!

You don't know that!

I am not going to sit here
and apologize for saving
your life.

You are no better than them
for doing what you've done.

You don't get it!

All right, it was us...

Or them.

And I chose us.

Now it's their blood
on your hands.

Can you live with that?

Yeah.

Yeah, I can, actually.

Because I know I did
everything I could!

All right, without mom and dad,
you're all I have left,

And I don't know why
you don't understand that,
and I'm sorry!

But I did what I had to do,
and that's all I can say.

No.

No, I can't leave them
here like this.

Listen, you can go,
and I'm not gonna hold it
against you, but...

Fuck!

Unh!

[ Sighs ]

[ Car door closes ]

[ Doors creak open ]

Afternoon.

Sheriff.

What can I do you for?

Well...

I'm looking for...

An old mill creek road.

You might know
where I find that?

Why the fuck would I know
where that is?

Excuse me, boy?

No, sir, couldn't help you.

You play the piano?

What?
I said,
do you play the piano?

It's a simple question, boy.

There ain't no right
or wrong answer.

No, I do not play the piano.

Is there something else
I can help you with?

I got business to take care of.

I can see that.

My rush is coming.

You see, I'm investigating
the recent disappearance
of a couple of my deputies.

But you wouldn't, uh, happen
to know anything about that,
now would you?

Nope.

People go missing
around these parts all the time.

Yeah.

Well, then...

My card.

Take the damn card.

You see anything strange,
give me a call, huh?

If you happen to see anything...

You know, weird.

Oh, yes, sir.

I wish I could've been
more help right now.

That's all right.

That's all right.

That's all right.

Have a nice day.

[ Doors creak open ]

[ Spits ]

The next girl that
gives me any attitude,
gonna fuckin' punch you so hard,

Your next period's gonna
come running out your nose!

Listen up you little faggots!

Each one of you
is gonna pick a number
between one... and ten.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Hey, Heidi...
[ Breathing

You want to quit
your yodeling?

[ Breathing

What's your number, darlin'?

Four.

What?!

Four.

[ Sighs ]

You sure?

[ Birds chirping ]

Yes? [ Sighs ]

[ Sighs ]

[ Sighs ]

What's your
number, sweetheart?

Seven.

Seven?!

What's your
number, sweetheart?

Two.

You sure?

It's okay.

You can change you're number.

You want to keep it
or change it?!

I want to keep it.

Okay.

You're the lucky winner.

Ohh!

[ Coughing ]

Oh, yeah.

We're going on a little trip.

[ Coughing ]

Come on, baby!
[ Breathing raggedly ]

[ Gasping ]

[ Grunts ]

Oh, yeah.

[ Laughing ]

We got a little surprise
for you, sugar plum!

[ Laughs ]
Oh, what am I gonna
do with that?!

Have no idea... no idea!

Yeah!

Little nervous, little nervous.

[ Laughs ]

Open that thing up,
empty it out!

Now...

What are you lookin' at?!

[ Grunting ]

Put that down.

Got a vacancy now.

Get in.

I said get in, bitch!

Come on!

Let's go! Move it!

We don't got all day!

Get in there.

Whoo!
[ Cries ]

Here we go!

[ Grunts ]
Okay!

[ Shouts ]

[ Grunts ]

Don't worry.
You're gonna be okay.

[ Laughs ]

That's not bad.

[ Grunts ]

There we go!

[ Cries ]

[ Cries ]

Got another one for you!

[ Cries ]

[ Laughs ]

Oh, this is fun!

We need more of these!

[ Gasps ]

[ Sniffles ]

Now watch out!

This one might be sharp!

[ Drill whirring ]

You all right in there?!

Fuck you!

[ Laughs ]

It's too late for that, bitch!

[ Drill whirring ]

Oh, come on, then.

Come on!

[ Drill whirring ]
Whoo!

[ Sighs ]

[ Drill whirs ]

[ Laughs ]

Oh, yeah!

Buckle up, bitch!

You're going for a ride!

[ Screaming ]

Whoo!
[ Screaming continues ]

Need some help?!

[ Laughing continues ]

Damn!

Looks like I got a strike!

[ Coughs ]

What's that, hun?

We...

Want to get something
off your chest?

[ Sighs ] We can pay you.

Pay me with what?

We have money.

Oh, do you now?

Where might this money be?

My pocket.

What?!

My back pocket.

Oh, you wouldn't mind
if I got it myself,
now would you?

[ Grunts softly ]

[ Grunts softly, chuckles ]

Oh.

[ Sniffs deeply ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Sighs ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

$100?

Is that all you got to offer?

You know there are some
things that money can't buy.

Like what?

A dinosaur.

[ Chuckles ]

[ Chuckles ]

[ Laughs ]

[ Inhales deeply ]

Well, look at that!

She's out on her feet!

[ Sighs ]

[ Laughs ]

[ Inhales deeply ]

Your friend over there...

What's her name?

Come on, darlin',
you can tell me.

Stephanie.

Oh! Stephanie, huh?

I don't like the way
she's looking at me.

[ Sighs ]

[ Birds chirping ]

In fact...

I think she wants to hurt me!

And I can't have that!

Not in this house!

[ Sighs ]

[ Whimpering ]

What do you think
we should do about that?

I don't know.

Just let her go.

[ Chuckles softly ]

[ Laughs ]

[ Birds chirping ]

Well, that ain't a bad idea.

You want to go?

Leave your friend here
all by herself?

You better make up
your mind before I change mine.

I said you want to go?!

Bitch, you listening to me?!

Yes, yes!

Finally.

It's just the two of us.

All alone.

It's okay.

It's okay.

Don't worry.

[ Whimpers ]
I always considered myself
the romantic type.

Hell, I've loved me
plenty of women out here!

Heck...

Not much of 'em
are lookers, but, hell...

I just fuck 'em from behind.

Hit 'er in the shitter...
That's what I say!

Can't trust you bitches,

Bleeding out every month
for days on end.

Without dying!

That shit ain't right.

[ Whimpers ]
Look, maybe I'm not
your type?

Hmm?

Aw, that's all right.

I think I'll turn things around.

I can be very persuasive.

I'll put on some music,
maybe something classical.

How about I read you
some poetry, some romantic
bullshit you girls like!

Hell...

Then you should be wet,
ready to go.

Then I'm gonna fuck you dry!

[ Breathing heavily ]

Aw, sweetheart...

You still playing hard to get?

That's okay.

Sometimes, I say, the hunt
is better then the meal itself!

Yeah, I bet you
do like the chase,
you motherfucker!

Oh, I love the chase.

You like to run?

'Cause I'll chase you.

I promise you that.

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Crying ]

[ Laughing ]

You got to pick one, boy!

[ Crying ]

You get the brunette.

[ Laughs ]

It's like giving a gun
to a 7-year-old.

You never know what's
gonna happen, but damn sure
it's gonna be entertaining.

[ Click ]

You didn't just do
what I think you did, did you?!

[ Click ]

Stupid fuck!

Son of a bitch!

Goddamn piece-of-shit fucker!

Can't do

because of you, bitch!

[ Grunts ]

[ Exhales sharply ]

[ Wood creaking ]

[ Shouts ]

[ Grunts ]

[ Gasps ]

[ Sighs ] Fuck you!

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Sighs ]

Whoo, looks like
we got ourselves a runner!

[ Breathing heavily ]

You haven't gone far

[ Gasps ]

[ Gunshot ]

[ Shouts ]

[ Screams ]
[ Laughs ]

Oh, you're making it too easy!

You're making it too easy!

Oh.

[ Sighing ]

Oh, where you goin'?

Don't leave me!

We, uh,
we had a future together.

Just you and i.

[ Shouts ]

[ Coughs ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Shouts ]

Fuck you!

[ Breathing heavily ]

We'll see about that.

[ Shouts ]

Everything's gonna be okay.

[ Gasps ]

[ Coughing ]

[ Chain saw buzzing ]

Whoo!

[ Buzzing continues ]

[ Buzzing continues ]

[ Moaning ]

[ Buzzing continues ]

[ Thud ]

[ Birds chirping ]

Help us, please!

[ Chirping continues ]

[ Shouting indistinctly ]

[ Shouts ]
[ Both breathing heavily ]

Where is he?!
He's... [ Breathes heavily ]

I think he's by the barn!

Okay, listen, I'm...
yeah, but you
don't understand.

No, it's gonna be okay.
I'll take care of this.
He's got a girl!

[ Breathing heavily ]
Look, I want you to go

To my truck,
and I want you to stay there.

There's a handgun
underneath the backseat.

There's two rounds in it.

If you're gonna use it,
I suggest you make 'em count.

Now you go on!
Go, get!

[ Birds chirping ]

[ Gun cocks ]

[ Birds chirping ]

Bitches, where you at?!

You want to play
hide-and-seek
with little old me?

[ Chirping continues ]

I will find you!

Where you at, bitches?!

[ Whistles ]

[ Chirping continues ]

Where you think
you're going, boy?

I'm just going for a walk.

Yeah?

You always go for a walk
with such a big gun?

Never know what...

You might find out here.

Why don't you do me
a favor there, boy?

Why don't you turn around
and face me nice and slow-like,
all right?

[ Rifle cocks ]

Just give me a reason, son.

I will blow your head clean off!

[ Rifle cocks ]

I want you to turn around
nice and slow.

I ain't gonna ask you twice.

[ Chirping continues ]

You got me in a bit
of a pickle, boy.

You killed some of my deputies.

They were good men,
with families!

And I ain't particularly fond
of explaining myself to a...

A grieving widow...

Why a sick fuck like you
would feel the need to take
their lives.

Hence my predicament.

You see, I am not a big fan
of the justice system.

So I'm thinking this
is something you and I

Are gonna have
to settle between us.

Man to man.

What exactly you think
you're gonna do?!

I was thinking
about shooting ya.

Right between the goddamn eyes.

Just give me a reason.

It's either that or you take
that shooter and you put it
down on the ground.

Either way!

Fuck you!

You want to play it
like that?

You want to dance?!

Sure.

I'll dance with you.

[ Chirping continues ]

All right.

Let's fucking dance.

[ Birds chirping ]

[ Chirping continues ]

[ Chirping continues ]

[ Chirping continues ]

Do you think
he's gonna make it back?

I don't know.

I hope so.

[ Chirping continues ]

[ Screaming ]

[ Gasping ]

[ Choking ]

[ Gunshot ]

Unh! [ Coughing ]

[ Coughing ]

[ Crunch ]

You son of a bitch.

Goddamn!
[ Breathing heavily ]

Motherfucker!

That's what I call a rush!

Oh!

Now you got me
in a little bit
of a predicament, too, now!

'Cause, see, I don't like pigs!

And I don't like assholes,
and, well, sheriff,
you are a little bit of both!

[ Breathing heavily ]

You like... you a man of God?

[ Birds chirping ]

Well, are ya?!

I reckon.

I'll show you God!
[ Shouts ]

[ Screaming ]

[ Squishing ]

Oh, yeah!

[ Laughs ]

[ Screaming continues ]

[ Squishing continues ]

[ Splash ]

[ Moaning ]

Come on!

Aah!

[ Moans ]

Aah!

[ Birds chirping ]

[ Gasps ] No.

[ Crying ] No, Lauren, no!

[ Exhales sharply ]

No!

No!

No! Lauren, no!

Well, kill me
you stupid, dumb shit!

[ Laughing ]

[ Chirping continues ]

[ Sighs, breathing heavily ]

[ Coughs ]

You've been waiting
for this, boy.

[ Sighs ]

[ Coughs ]

[ Coughs ]

Kill me, you stupid fucker!

[ Laughs ]

[ Rifle cocks ]

[ Laughing ]

[ Wind whistling ]

Shh.

It's okay.

It's okay.

Everything will be all right.

They can't hurt you anymore.

Shh.

And slowly...

But surely...

The feelings will go away.

Forever...

And ever.

Forever...

And ever.
