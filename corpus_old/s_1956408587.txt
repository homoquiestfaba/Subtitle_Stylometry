JIMMY THE BARTENDER:
What got you all riled up?

JOSEPH GREENE: The pastor
and those damn church people

are really pissing me off.

Why are you
complaining about them?

Today's not Sunday.

Plenty of parking
spaces on the block.

Nah, it has
nothing to do with parking,

I promise you that.
It's much bigger than parking.

Here, look at this.

What's this?

That, my friend,
is my brother and I's ticket

out of this
shithole neighborhood.

Looks like you've got
yourself an offer to buy

your old man's house.

So why are you so mad
at the church people?

The pastor.
Alright, man?

He keeps declining to sell,

which is holding up the deal
which is holding up our money.

DANIEL GREENE: Yeah,
and it doesn't make any sense because

that church is beat down,
and he ain't doing anything

but holding the whole
neighborhood hostage.

Yeah, listen. That, that
pastor's up there and he's

preaching every Sunday how
you should better the community.

Now's his chance. He could
sell it, make a couple duckets,

give it to the community
center before that gets

closed down, too.
But nah, he's all talk.

Why don't you go talk to him?
Talk to him about what?

Maybe if it hears, he
hears something from people

in the community,
he'll reconsider.

Pffff.

No, no, no, no.

No, that's a good idea.
Let's go talk to the pastor.

[CHUCKLING SOUND]
DAN: Oh, oka--

Hey, Jimmy, you keep
that. I'll be back, alright?

We'r-we're gonna go
talk to the pastor, alright?

Thanks, Jimmy.
All right.

Yeah, uh, we'll be back. Haha.

[BELL TOLLING SOUND]

[METAL LATCH BANGING SOUND]
[WOOD CREAKING SOUND]

Ha. Look at this place, man.

DAN: Yeah, I don't like churches, man.
The whole life and death

thing just f-freaks me out.

Listen, man, knock it
off with that sissy talk.

We're here to conduct
business and that's it.

You got me?
All right, yeah. I got you s--

Can I help you?
Jesus, no!

Go get the pastor.
Do you have an appointment?

No. But we're here for
business, so go get him.

I'm sorry, gentlemen, but
he has already left for the day.

Can I take a message?

Yeah, I'm Dan.
This is my brother Joe.

We want to know why he's
not sellin' off this building.

Listen, we got a lot of
property. Y-you know what, Flo,

you can't help us. Go get the
pastor. Get him on the phone.

Go do what you got to do.
Yeah, yeah.

Do something. Get out of here.

Please calm down, gentlemen.
Yeah, what?

If you have a seat,
This is us calm.

I can get
somebody to help you.

Nah, Flo. We'll stand. We're
good. Don't worry about it.

Just go get the
pastor, will you?

I will be right back.

All right, yeah. Come back.
You will be, sweetness.

Man, this building is old.

JOSEPH: All the more
reason to sell it off.

BRETT LAWSON:
It's been three months.

Do you need me to step i--?

RONALD LAWSON: Dad,
I don't need you to hold my hand.

Look, you're tying up
a lot of Lawson funds

working on this deal.

BRETT LAWSON:
I'll postpone the vacation.

I'll meet with the preacher.
Make sure we're not pumpin'

money into a dead horse.

Oh dad, I don't need
your help on this, okay?

I can handle this.
You go do whatever it is

that you do on vacation.

When you get
back this will be done.

Okay.

Okay?

I'll go.

BRETT:
I trust you'll get it done.

And I'll see you when

ELIZABETH HAINES: Mr. Lawson,
Mr. Arcos called and said that he will be

be in town for a convention,

and he would like to know
your availability for a meeting.

Yeah, uh, just, uh, schedule
him for Monday afternoon.

ELIZABETH:
Okay.

I need to get this done.

Okay, Arcos is one of my
newest and biggest backers.

And he sought me out to
make his mark in the US.

Honestly, I've never
even heard of the guy,

but if he wants to give
me his foreign money,

then I cannot
let him lose faith.

I mean, I'm sure for this
meeting, he's probably gonna

want some kind
of progress report.

Just put a
squeeze on the pastor.

ADRIAN SELTZER: Doin' the
best I can short of extortion.

Well, then sweeten the offer.

I already did, twice,
and he's not accepting.

How are you making out with Adu?

Come on. Don't worry about
boy genius, okay? He's a rookie.

He's got all that new money
burnin' a hole in his pocket.

You know he's dealing with
allegations that he stole his

idea from his
old business partner?

I mean, nobody wants to
touch the guy. He's a lock.

Trust me.
Great.

Do you have any idea
how important this is?

I mean, this is finally
my chance to

get out of my father's shadow.

You know, I've put literally
everything into this project.

We need this deal to go through

or we lose all respectability.

Looks like I'm gonna
have to go to church Sunday.

[UPBEAT FUNK MUSIC]
[DOG BARKING SOUND]

â™ª PRAISE THE LORD â™ª

LORETTA JAMES: I wish we
had a church like that.

Modern mega churches,
their ministries are constantly

evolving and growing.

PASTOR ERIC JAMES: Those are nice,
but I'm not leaving my church.

It's only a building.

It's more than just a building.

It happens to be my family
legacy, and I have an obligation

to make sure that
the spirit stays alive.

Our membership is dwindling
because our members have been

migrating to these newer
churches. How can we compete?

And on top of that our
church is falling apart.

Yes, well that's why
we have a building fund--

Oh, no. This so-called building
fund can't even fix the small

problems that we have now.

How is it going to
fund the major renovations?

No, we need to sell!

That's enough!

Look, sweetheart,
it is Sunday morning.

I-I've got to get my head right
to deliver today's sermon.

It's gonna be okay.

Yeah, tell me about it.

Yeah, I'm worried
he won't get it done.

Yeah, well why don't you shoot
me the number of your heavy.

See if we can't shake
this pastor off his cross.

Yeah.

[SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

Yeah, okay.
I'll keep you posted. Thanks.

[SWHOOSHING SOUND]

[RINGING SOUND]

Elizabeth?

Yeah.

Okay, I'm on my way.

It's fifty-one-o--

[INTENSE SUSPENSE TONE]

So-sorry.
Fifty-one-O-one.

Yeah, see you at the church.

Morning, Maria.

Good morning, Pastor.

Ooh, kinda cold in here.

Did you, uh, turn the
heat on this morning?

The heat went out on Thursday.

The HVAC company
came in yesterday,

but they didn't have the
part that they needed to fix it

in stock, because
the unit is so old.

They told me they will
call me when it comes in.

Okay, well, I guess
we'll just have to make do.

It's freezing in here.
Oh, it's not that bad.

It'll be warm in no time at all.

MARIA:
Mm-hmm.

Little cold?
Every day it's something else.

All the money
is going to repairs.

There's nothing
left for improvements.

Please, Loretta, not now.

All I'm saying is that
you should take them up

on their offer
to sell the church.

Then we can move forward

and have a new
building like everyone else.

MARIA:
You're selling the church?

No!

Oh, okay.

Everything is clean
and ready for service.

Do you want anything
else before we start?

No, no, thank you, I'm fine.

Okay.

You see what you just did?

If she goes out and
tells the congregation,

this office is gonna be
flooded with questions.

You know, that
might not be a bad thing.

I mean you have an obligation

to your members to do
anything and everything

for the good of this
church and this ministry.

It's wrong to
keep this from them.

I am not selling the church.

Well, will you
at least think about it?

is my refuge and my fortress.

My God, in him will I trust.

Surely, he shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler

and from the
noisome pestilence.

He shall cover
thee with his feathers

and under his
wings shalt thou trust.

His truth shall be
thy shield and buckler.

Thank you, Pastor.
Thank you

Amazing sermon!

Thank you.

How can I help you?
Uh, I'm Ron Lawson,

head of Lawson Development
Corp., and this is my beautiful

assistant, Elizabeth.

Hello.

And I believe the question
here is how can we help you?

You help me?
I, I don't understand.

It's, it's simple really.

Imagine a new
ministry, a new building,

a new place to reach
out to the community,

a place where
air circulation, heating,

and other simple
but important amenities

are all at a preacher of
your status' fingertips.

Hear me out.

Boom, mega screen.

Boom, mega screen.

Two-thousand plus
people watching you every week

deliver your
sermon right up close,

not a bad seat in the house.

Hell, I can do it for you.

Matter of fact,
I'll build that for you.

You know I'm not interested in
selling the church.

So if you're finished,

I have some work to do.

Okay, okay.
Look, no problem.

You know it's just, mmm.

It would be such a shame if you
just let an opportunity for your

ministry and for
yourself go by like this.

Elizabeth.

Let's just say
that's a little something

to get you forward-thinking.

We'll be in touch.

[SOUND OF DEPARTING FOOTSTEPS]

[SOUND OF DOOR SLAMMING]

Wow.
This is amazing.

Look at this.

I mean, it's okay.

Okay?
It's more than okay.

Do you know what we can do
with a building like this?

I mean, think about it.

Food programs, summer camp,

even a school.

Yeah, why can't we do that here?

Eric, be serious.

I mean have you looked around?

What you have to
realize is that this ministry

is not the building.

This ministry is
what you make it.

Look, this building is
embedded in my family history.

I mean generations of
families have worshiped here.

We got married here.

And that's all you're gonna
end up with in this church

is your family.

Everyone else is gonna be
worshiping somewhere else.

Look, I'm not
letting them come in

and knock down the church

just so they can
build some more stores

and apartment buildings.

I mean the community needs us.

We can build nearby.

What's in here, more pictures?

[GASPING SOUND]

Ahahahaha.

What kind of a man
do they think I am?

That is totally disrespectful.

No. You give so
much to the community.

Maybe this is God's way of
giving something back to you.

Oh, like this?

God works in mysterious ways.

Think about it.

When was the last
time you had a vacation,

a new car,

oh, or a new house?

[DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

Well, how much is that?

A lot of money.

God, that could really help us.

See, that's the spirit.

[BRAKES SCREECHING]

Get out of the way!

Go!

Jesus Christ almighty.

Get out of the--

[OMINOUS PERCUSSIVE MUSIC]

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

Noooo!

Mr. Lawson, Mr. Arcos is here.

RONALD:
Andrei, how're you doin'?

ANDREI:
Hello.

Hi. Good to see you.

Uh, take a seat.

Adrian?
How are you?

We'll actually get started
as soon as everyone arrives.

Are we expecting
any more guests?

Mr. Lawson, Mr. Adu.

RONALD:
Oh, Simon?

Hello, Ron.
Good to see you

This is our investment
partner, Andrei Arcos.

Nice to meet you.
Uh, take a seat.

Adrian?

How are you today?

Good.
Are you excited, huh?

'Cause it's gonna be big.

Of course, I'm excited.

It's a pleasure to work on
this development with you.

So, what did I miss?

I was asking about
the Treville development,

if there is any progress?

Yes. And actually we
have all the residential lots

all under contract.

What about the church?

We, uhh, we hit some snags,

but I'm pretty confident

that we're gonna have the deal
done by the end of the week.

Good, good news.

How can you be so sure?

Let's just say, uh,
his donation cup filleth over.

Ron showed
him the big picture.

By the end of the week he'll
be begging us to buy that dump.

I guess sometimes we have
to be ruthless to get ahead.

Ain't that right, Simon?

Yeah, I, I guess.

By the end of the week.

Yes, by the end of the week.

Great job, guys. Keep pressing.

I'll be in town
for a few more days.

Great talk, thank you.

Keep me posted.

[SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

[SOUND OF WIND BLOWING]

[SOUND OF POLICE SIREN]

gonna do when your husband

gets back from deployment?

VERONICA LEEKS: I don't know.
I haven't thought about it.

You haven't
thought about it yet?

No.

Just enjoying our time.

Okay.

Besides we have nine
months to figure it out.

I'll be right back.

[SOUND OF WATER CRASHING]
[DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

[EERIE AMBIENT MUSIC]

[SOUND OF DOG BARKING]

So, have you
convinced him to sell?

Almost, but I'm not worried.

That's why I put you in
charge of the trustee board.

I need an ally.

Hmm. I know.

I doubt if he'll
vote for a move,

no matter how much
money we offer him.

That's why I haven't spoken
to him. But I'm not worried.

I'm sure we can get the
vote without the deacons.

[SOUND OF METAL BANGING ON WOOD]
Excuse me.

MELANIE BANKS: Hello.

Thanks for coming.
Thanks for having me.

Please, come in. Have a seat.

My pleasure.

LORETTA: Veronica and I were
just talking about the votes.

Oh, okay. So let me sum
up what we are facing here.

The charter of the
church allows the pastor

to make decisions without
involvement of the board,

except for relocation,
denomination, and financial

expenditures over $10,000.

So in order to move
forward on any matter

that falls within
these exceptions,

a vote of yes from two
out of the three boards

and the pastor is needed.

Now Loretta, I'm quite
sure you'll handle the pastor.

Of course. How do
you think we got this far?

Great, great.
Has anyone spoken to Joan?

We're definitely gonna
need the stewardess board

because it will
be almost impossible

to have the deacons on board.

That's what Loretta was
saying before you came over.

That Deacon Williams, he
is an Old Testament stiff.

If it was up to him, he would
live and die in that church.

Mm-hmm.
But I did speak to Joan,

and she's already planting
the seeds with the stewardess.

Good.

So, Ron told me he made a
little trip to the church.

Really?
Yep.

I think I'm owed a thank you!

Yes, you are.
Hmm.

Thank you.
Oh, here you go.

I think this calls for a toast.

To a new building,

to more members,

and most
importantly, more money.

I second that.

[SOUND OF BIRDS CHIRPING]
[SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

LORETTA: This is what you preach
about, the good life.

How about we, uh,

just have dinner and
talk about the future?

Hmm?

Okay.

Hmm.

That is something.
Mm-hmm.

After you.

Thank you.

Good morning, church family.

GROUP:
Good morning.

As some of you may know,

there is a company called the
Lawson Development Corporation

and they are proposing to
build a mixed use complex

right on the spot here.

GROUP:
[GASPING SOUNDS]

What?
(INDISCERNIBLE MURMURS)

PASTOR ERIC: It is my job as your
pastor to investigate any and all,

uh, possibilities of
expanding both the church

and our ministry.

The Lawson Corporation has
made a very attractive offer

for this building.

Now, if you look
in your packets,

what you see are
pictures of a new church

that they have proposed--

These, um, drawings are okay,

but our spirithood,

the soul of this ministry is
in the walls of this church.

Yes, but if you think about it,

uh, actually the, the
spirit and soul of this ministry

lies within each
and every one of us.

JOAN LAURELS:
I think it's a great idea.

CROWD:
[INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER]

Wait, wait. We can give back
so much more to the community

in a building like that.

What would we do there
that we can't do here?

PASTOR ERIC:
Now, calm down.

Calm down, everybody.

Um, you'll all have a
chance to express your opinion

in the form of a vote.
And now, as you know,

church doctrine states
that I can't make a decision

of this magnitude without
the support of the boards.

So, uh, what I
think we should do is,

uh, basically the boards need to

repair their
different chambers and uh,

discuss the
proposal and uh, vote on it.

So, follow your conscience

and pray before you vote.

[DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

[DRAMATIC
ORCHESTRAL MUSIC CONTINUES]


[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

I counted them twice.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Well,

before we find
out the results,

there is one thing I'd
like to say and that is,

quite simply, that
no matter what the vote

our church and our ministry

will continue to
grow and prosper.

If we stay,

we will find the money to return
this church to prominence.

And if we sell,

we'll embrace the new
building as our home.

Either way,
it's part of God's plan.

Amen!

CONGREGATION:
Amen!

[CHUCKLING SOUND]

Amen.

Okay.

The trustee board
votes four to one to sell.

[INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER]

The deacon board
votes four to one to stay.

[INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER]

Why? Who--
It wasn't me.

The stewardess board,

[SOUND OF DOOR SLAMMING]

[DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

[SOUND OF HORN BLOWING]

[SOUND OF PHONE RINGING]

[BEEP SOUND]

Pastor, hey,
what's the good word?

PASTOR ERIC:
Well, a decision has been made.

Yeah?

PASTOR ERIC: Our board has
voted to sell the church.

Mm.

PASTOR ERIC:
But we do have conditions.

No, that's, that's great.

Yeah, any, absolutely anything
you want.

Matter of fact, why don't you
and I get together next week,

and we can scout
some new locations?

PASTOR ERIC: So, uh,
what about the money in the envelope?

RONALD:
Never existed.

[SOUND OF WIND WHOOSHING]

PASTOR ERIC: Looks like
you have yourself a deal.

Why don't we
get together Friday.

Uh, how's six p.m.
work at the church?

PASTOR ERIC:
Friday at six p.m. works for me.

RONALD: Okay, I'll bring my
guys over and get this done.

PASTOR ERIC:
Okay, see you then.

All right,
hey and, uh, and pastor,

you, you really saved me.

[BEEPING SOUNDS]

[RINGING SOUND]

Hello?
Hey, Simon, hold on.

[RINGING SOUND]

[BEEPING SOUNDS]

Hey, Ron?

Simon, Arcos, it's Ron.

SIMON:
What's up?

We got the church.

Ha! Fantastic.
Wow, that was fast.

Who did you have to sleep with?

What?

SIMON: Just kidding.
Great job, Ron.

Yeah, um, well,
I got to get going.

I got to call, uh, Adrian.

But we're gonna
meet on Friday at six p.m.

[SOUND OF WIND WHOOSHING]
We'll finish the deal, okay?

Yeah, mate. I'm thrilled.
I can't wait to cut the ribbon.

All right, guys.

Okay, bye.

[BEEP SOUND]

Great. Yup.
Alright, see you soon.

Mmm!
[CREAKING SOUND]

Elizabeth!

PASTOR ERIC:
Ah, it's beautiful.

It's even more
beautiful in person.

Look at these marble
floors. This is beautiful.

This is great.
Oh, I'm so excited.

I am, too. This is what
we've always prayed for.

LORETTA: I kno--

Come on. Let me show you
the kitchen and a pool out back.

It's amazing.

You know what?

We'll take it!
Oh, my God.

-Hahahahahaha

Oh, this is my
dream house. Oh, muah!

Thank you.

[SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

So, Veronica, if you
want to take one last look at

proposal here, you can see
things are gonna be really,

really good.

Beautiful ring.

How long have you been married?

Just one year.

Newlyweds.

Congrats.

Thanks.

Marriage is a beautiful thing,

cherished in my country,

more so than in
the United States,

I guess.

PASTOR ERIC:
Yes, good evening.

Good evening, Pastor.
Is everybody ready?

Yes. Joan is just getting
your notes out of your office.

Good evening, Pastor.

Good to see you.
Hello.

Uh, these are the investors
I was telling you about.

At the end here
we've got Simon Adu,

founder of Shoppecloud.com.

Yes, hi.
I read an article about you.

My kids love your website.

Great. Thank you

And here we have Andrei Arcos.

He is a global
developer and investor.

Global developer?
That sounds very exciting.

It's okay.

And with the,
the help of these guys,

we are gonna turn this area
into a first class neighborhood.

Oh, you can do that without,
uh, tearing down this church.

Deacon.

It's fine.

Some people are not this
easily persuaded as others.

So, what do you say
we make this official?

Elizabeth, my lucky pen.

Here you are.

Pastor?

Good night.

Oh, good night, Maria.

See ya' Sunday.

[LOW THUDDING SOUND]

What was that?

Uh,
[DISTANT THUDDING SOUND]

Oh, probably just
some kids outside.

Yeah.
I-I'll go check it out.

Ahh, these
kids in this neighbor-

Ahhhhh!

Oh!

[SNARL SOUND]

But a different kind.

What do you mean by that?

Eric.

Eric.

Eric

Eric!

[EERIE TONE]

Yeah. Yeah.

Oh.

In my country
we have an old myth.

If the leaders of
the church are not pure,

then the church
engulfs their spirits

and holds them within until
they are released for judgment.

The, the church what?
That doesn't make any sense.

Boss, there ain't
nobody in there, all right?

All right, look.
Simon's probably just upstairs.

I mean, what,
they can go down there.

We're goin' upstairs.
We're gonna find Simon,

and we're gonna
get the hell out of here.

Let's go.
Let's go.

Ugh!

Damn.

[DISTORTED SCREAM]

Ugh!

Do you think
we're gonna find Simo--

Look, look, I don't know,
but let's look downstairs, okay?

Well at least if
they do find the others,

they can tell them that
we're here looking for them.

PASTOR ERIC:
Loretta?

Hopefully.

[EERIE AMBIENT MUSIC]

[HEAVY ECHOED BREATHING]

[EERIE ORGAN MUSIC]

Something about this
place just isn't right.

[SOUND OF GLASS RUSTLING]

What was that?

What was what?

[SOUND OF WIND HOWLING]

[SUSPENSEFUL
ORCHESTRAL MUSIC FADES IN]

No, no, no, no. Go back!
Simon. Hey Simon!

There's something in here.
What's going on? Simon?

What's going on? Simon!
Open the door.

I don't hear anything.

I didn't hear anything, either.

That sounds like it
was in the sanctuary.

Well, let's get up
there. Come on, quickly.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]
[WHIMPERING SOUNDS]


Oh, God.

Please help me.

[DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

[INDISCERNIBLE WHISPERS]

[DRONING SOUND]

You gotta push, kid.
Push harder. Come on.

Yo, Arcos, come on.

What's going on?
Come on, mate.

Open the door!
Open the door!

Come on, come on!
Open the door Simon

Adrian, break
this damn door down!

Ah! Ahh!

Damn it! Ronald!

Ah!

[GROWLING SOUND]

[EERIE AMBIENT MUSIC]
[GASPING SOUNDS]

Ugh!

Oh!

Jesus. What?

What's happening?

A great panic from the
Lord will be among them.

Open these doors!
Why won't you let us go!

Ron?

Adrian?

[SUSPENSEFUL TONE]

Come on, mates.

Adrian?

[INDISCERNIBLE ECHOING WHISPERS]

[PAINFUL SCREAMING]

I'm not leaving without Loretta.

MELANIE:
We're not gonna find Loretta.

You just saw what
happened to Simon.

The church has them.

They're not coming back.

Listen to her.

You have to save yourself.

Loretta's gone.

[PANTING SOUNDS]

[SOUND OF ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

[WIND WHOOSHING]

[EERIE AMBIENT SOUNDS]

Arragh!

We're trapped
in our own church.

I can't push anymore.

We're wastin' our time here.

You got any tools in this place?

[CREAKING SOUND]

Oh, my God.

Downstairs in the storage room.

Okay.

Let me go get something

and let me get
these doors open, okay?

Did you not just
see what happened?

You're not going anywhere
and we are not splitting up.

It doesn't matter.

We're not getting out of here.

The church is keeping us here.

Oh, please, stop
with that Romanian myth!

True or not, what
are we supposed to do,

stand still here and die?

ADRIAN:
Hey, listen, guys. Listen.

We will get the tools.

Everybody relax.

And I'll be back, okay?

Just sit tight.

The-

[OMINOUS TONE]

Careful, Deacon.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

[CREAKING SOUND]

[SOUND OF METAL RATTLING]

[INDISCERNIBLE VOICES ECHOING]
[SOUND OF ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

Please, let me go.

Whatever you are.

Please, let me go.

Ahh!

Ahh! Ughh. Ahh. Ah.

whatever you want me to do.

[SOUND DRAINING WATER]

Tell me what you want
me to do. Please, please,

please let me go.

[EXPLOSION SOUND]
Ahh!

Ahhh!
Oh, my God!

Mel, Mel!
Joan, are you okay?

Where were you?

I, I, I saw--

You saw what?

Did you see Loretta?
No.

I, I saw.
[SOUND OF WIND WHOOSHING]

Ahh!
[GROWLING SOUND]

Joan!

Where did she go?
She was just here.

VERONICA:
What did she mean I saw?

Ahhh!!!

ADRIAN:
Boss, boss!

[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC FADES IN]

What happened?
I heard screaming.

I came as fast as I could.

It's Joan.

Did you find her?
She found us.

We just lost her.

I'll got check the kitchen!

Veronica!

Hey, Boss.

I've had enough
of this, alright?

I'm gonna go get
these tools, okay?

I'm not spending another minute
here. We're gettin' out of here.

You understand?

She's not here.

Why isn't she here?

She's not anywhere.

What do you think
is happening to us?

I have no logical or
a biblical explanation.

It could be the devil's work.

Do you believe
what Andrei said?

No.

If all myths were true, then
the world would be like this.

Alright,
Alright, alright, wait, wait

Wait!
Hey, listen here, Pastor.

I'm getting' tired of
you. You understand, okay?

I'm not gonna wait
and die here tonight

with all those creeps
and ghouls in the wall.

You got me?
I'm goin' home tonight.

You understand me?
Now move out of my way.

Watch out.

Adrian, let's go.
No. You go.

I'll wait here.

[EERIE AMBIENT MUSIC]

Hello?

Help me!

Can you help me?

[PAINFUL SCREAMING]

Dear God.
[THRILLING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

PASTOR ERIC:
It won't open.

Arrrgh-yahh!

Ahhh!!!
[GROWLING SOUND]

[LOW THUD SOUND]

Oh, my God!

[GROWLING SOUND]
Veronica!

ADRIAN:
Let me in here.

[RATTLING SOUND]

Please, I've got
you. Easy, I've got you.

What are you
doing, what's she doing?

She's frozen, she can't move.
Veronica

What do you
mean, she's frozen?

Veronica?

Try to lift her up. Try to l--
C'mon, get her up. C'mon.

I felt it.
Felt what?

Felt what?

I'll be back.

I'm going to get
some tools. Ugh!

Adrian, no. Don't,
don't go by yourself!

Adrian!

Adrian!

Ugh.

I rebuke you, devil.

I rebuke all the
evilness you bring.

Surrender to the
power of the holy spirit.

This is the holy spirit.

No!

God may move in mysterious ways,

but not like this.

Wait.
Joan said, "I saw you."

What could she have
been talking about?

Look, stop it!
We are in a church.

We were all together.
Who knows what she saw.

You're probably right. She was
just scared out of her mind.

That can happen when you
have a spirit chasing you.

Alright, enough!

Enough with this
shit already, okay?

Gods, spirits, whatever.

Obviously, something's
going on. So, what's the deal?

Was this place built on,
on a cemetery of something?

No.

Look, for all we know
whatever it was is gone now.

Save Veronica.
She's still here.

Yes.
What is with you people?

Do something.
Why aren't you doing something?

You're a pastor.
Calm down, okay?

Calm down. Hey.

Just--

What?

I'm sorry, Pastor,
but according to the tale,

the spirit will not leave

until he has taken every
unpure soul within this church.

Well, I guess that
counts me out. What about you?

No angel, but I'm not evil.

Well, let's let your so-called
spirit be the judge of that.

I suggest that we all sit down

and talk this out
and devise a plan.

Hmm!

Ugh!
Adrian!

Ugh-ahh!

Let's go take care of business.

[OMINOUS TONE]

[INDISCERNIBLE EERIE WHISPERS]

Ah. So is it my turn now?

Huh?
[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

Huh, come on.

Huh?

How about it?

Come and take me. Come on!

Hughh! Hughh!

Ugh! Aghh!

Yeah, come on. Hughh!

Ughhh!

Go ahead and take it.
Come on. You want some?

Ah! no, no! Stop!

Ah! Ah! No! Nooo!

[GROWLING SOUNDS]
[INDISCERNIBLE SCREAMS]

Ah! Get off me!
[OMINOUS AMBIENT SOUNDS]

This place is crazy!

Ahh, ahh, ahh!
Get off me, get off me!

You son of a bitch, come on!

I'll fight yous off!
You sons of bitches!

Come on, fight me.

Huh? Come on, right here.

[SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRATION]
He's still not back yet.

He'll be back, okay?

The guy's tougher
'than a two dollar steak.

You don't get it, do you?

You can't fight
something you can't see.

The outcome is
already determined for us.

Some will make
it, some will not.

You know I am so tired of
hearing you talk about something

you don't know anything about.

I mean I have read
the Bible back and forth.

I-I've never heard of that.

Pastor James,
I have held my tongue,

but I won't any longer

and I think it is time to
consider what he's saying.

At least he has an explanation
for what is going on.

I know I don't have one.

Do you?

God damn!
[DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

You're not taking me.
You're not taking me!

Ah, Ahh!

[PAINFUL SCREAMS]

[SOUNDS OF WIND HOWLING]

Ugh.
[ORCHESTRATION FADES OUT]

So what do we do now?

We wait.

What are we waiting for?

For Adrian. Alright?

He, he will be back with
something to get us out of here.

The whole--
Uh, don't start!

Fine.

Adrian is never
coming back, is he?

He'll be back.

Okay, Andrei.

Now, I'm a pastor,

so I'm probably
the purest one here.

Why don't you go ahead and
tell the story behind your myth.

I'm sure I'm gonna feel the same
way about it when you're done.

You sure?
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

Shoot. Ahhh!
[GROWLING SOUNDS]

Shhhhhoot!

Great! He's gone!

No need to look
for him. You won't find him.

Nice theory, huh?
Nice freaking theory.

[DRONING SOUND]

[EERIE AMBIENCE]

Loretta?

Loretta!

[DRONING SOUND]

Fu--

God damn!
It's you.

Isn't it?

Me? What?

What are you talkin' about?

You have something
to do with all of this.

I can feel it!

No, no, no. I've been
here with you the whole time.

No.
Don't blame me!

DEACON WILLIAMS:
Miss Haines?

DEACON WILLIAMS:
Miss Haines,

I can understand
your frustration,

but I don't believe
that he is at fault.

He is behind this.

How? We've been
together all night.

Explain how he knows so
much about this biblical myth.

Look,

I'm not possessed
or a devil's advocate.

I just know a story

that was passed down through
my families in my country.

I didn't think of it
being true until tonight.

True? You think
that all this is true?

Look around you.
Bullshit!

[METAL CLANK SOUND]
[METAL CREAKING SOUND]

Adrian, it's about time.

There's nobody there.

What do you mean there's
no one there? He's got--

He's not there.

How could he not, how
could he not be there?

Who opened the door?

I'm still surprised you
have to ask that question.

I don't care who
opened the door.

I'm just happy that it's open.

Let's get out of here!

I'm not going
anywhere near him.

I'm the least of your worries.

I will keep an
eye on him. Trust me.

Now come on,
let's go quickly, now.

Now!

I feel like
whatever the spirit is,

it's playing with us.

It's tellin' us where to go.

Well, think about
how the doors opened.

[INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER]

It's obviously containing us
until it wants us to move, whi--

Andrei,

do you know anything more
about the myth that can help us?

I wish, but I
told you all I know.

[EERIE AMBIENT MUSIC]
[INDISCERNIBLE WHISPERS]

Loretta?

Over here.

[DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

[SOUND OF CRICKETS CHIRPING]

Ah!

Damn!
Did you expect that to open?

RONALD:
Wishful thinking at This point.

So close.

Isn't it ironic?

What?
That we're in a sanctuary.

Isn't this where God is?

Isn't this supposed
to be a safe haven?

And for us,

it's the total opposite.

Hey, I'm gonna go upstairs,
all right, on the balcony.

Maybe one of these windows
or something's open.

Good. You check that one out.
We'll check out the other side.

[EERIE TONE]

[SOUND OF ECHOING WHISPERS]

[GROWLING SOUNDS]

[EERIE TONE]

[DISTORTED WHISPERS]
[GROWLING SOUNDS]

I'll try these. You two see if
you can get the other windows

open down there.

[DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC]

Ughh! Ahh!

Ugh! Of course they won't open.

Dear Lord, release us,
I beg you. Set us free.

No luck!

[GRUNTING SOUND]

[GROWLING SOUND]
(DISTORTED ECHOING SOUNDS)

Do you, do you see that?

What?

Eyes.

The eyes are following me.

Ronald:
All right.

Elizabeth, I don't see anything.

I'm telling you.

The picture is watching me.

Hey!
Elizabeth?

Hmm?

Let's get you home, okay?

This place is
playing mind games with us.

[GROWLING SOUND]

[SOUND OF BELL TOLLING]

I'm okay.

Dude, there's something in here.

I know.

I can feel it.

This might be the end.

I hope so.

[LOUD SCREECHING SOUND]
Oh, no!

Damn it!
I thought this was over.

Where are you when
we need you, God? Huh?

Where are you when we need you?

We're all gonna die.

[DRAMATIC MUSICAL BUILD UP]

No, we're not.

Hey! Elizabeth,
we are not gonna die.

[CREAKING SOUND]

Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

Hey, look,

Nothing is going
to happen to you.

I'm not going anywhere him.

Come on down.
You have to climb over.

Climb over?
Yes, climb over.

All right.
We got you

We'll, we'll catch you.

Come on, that's it.

Come on, that's it.

DEACON:
Now, come on.

DEACON:
Easy.

Easy. More.

Whoa.
All right, easy, easy.

Ahh. Ahh.

Thank you.
Okay, okay.

They've been overcome by greed,

This church will crumble

and my people will be released
from within these walls.

I will be back!
