So what do you wanna do?

Thought so.

What's the matter?

Nothing,
just slow down a little bit.

Yeah, right.

Perry, I'm serious.

I really like your car.

Yeah, it was Ricky's.

Oh right, sorry.

He was killed by that bastard
son of a bitch.

I swear to God it was,
worst night of my life.

I'm so sorry.

Yeah, this car is all I have to
remember him by.

Well, maybe, this will make you
feel better.

What was that?

No stop, stop.

I definitely heard something.

It came from over there.

What are you doing?

Hello?

Hey Tyler, is that you, bro?

Perry?

Perry!

Oh, you know what?

This really isn't funny now.

So why don't you come on out?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Listen, I can't hustle
with anyone,

that you're searching for.

[Damon laughing]

PERRY:
Please don't!

[Perry coughing]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

So here you are,

what took you so long
to find me?

You bastard.

Your hand shakes,
'cause you have doubt.

You ain't gonna pull
that trigger.

Fuck you.

I don't have any doubt,
you killed my friends.

Your friends got in my way.

And you'd kill me too,
if given the chance.

[Damon chuckles]

If I wanted you dead,
we wouldn't be having this

conversation with each other
right now, would we?

You liked killing them.

Well, that should make
no difference

because killing comes easier
for some people,

somebody like me.

It was never supposed
to be like this.

You promised you never
would have done that.

The ring had to be secured

and your fucking friends
stood in the way.

Fuck you!

Stop saying that!

I needed the ring.

And I couldn't have gotten it
without your help, Adrianna.

You will be compensated.

You son of a bitch!

Drop the gun
or I'll throw this

fucking butcher knife
right into your head.

I'm not afraid of you.

Not anymore.

The Chief put a bounty
on your head.

I kill you and bring him
the mask

and I'll have all the money
I ever need.

You really think the Chief is
gonna let you live?

First the ring,
and now the mask.

An evil wind blows through him.

The curse is not buried
in the sand, my child.

I'll take my chances.

Adrianna,
the curse is alive.

DAMON: An evil wind blows
through you, too.

The weakness of the enemy
creates our strength.

From this strength,
we can thrive.

We can thrive in life,
and in death.

After all, all those before us
are not really dead.

Their hearts can beat
in the souls

that they leave behind.

There is dignity in passing from
this world

into the next.

After all, the tragedy of life
is not death.

The tragedy of life is what we
let die inside of us

while we live.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hello?

TOCHO (ON PHONE):
<i>Is it done?</i>

Yes.

TOCHO (ON PHONE):
<i>Good.</i>

<i>Bring me the mask.</i>

No.

<i>No mask, no reward.</i>

ADRIANNA (ON PHONE):
<i>I don't want your money, Chief.</i>

I want nothing
to do with you.

TOCHO (ON PHONE): <i>It's too late
for that, my darling.</i>

It's too late
for a lot of things.

Bring me the mask.

ADRIANNA (ON PHONE):
<i>The mask is gone.</i>

Buried in the ground,
given back to the earth.

That's the end of all
of this, Chief.

No more mask,
no more killings.

Don't you dare defy me.

It's over.

It's not over,
you little bitch.

It's not over
until I say it's over!

You have to pay for
what you've done.

TOCHO (ON PHONE):
<i>I will end...</i>

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Play it.

TOCHO (ON TAPE): <i>Adrianna,
you know who this is.</i>

<i>And you know what I want.</i>

<i>You think you're in control?</i>

<i>You think you call
the shots?</i>

<i>You are out of your depth,
little girl.</i>

<i>Let me make this as simple
for you as possible.</i>

<i>You bring me the mask tonight or
you will not live</i>

<i>to see tomorrow.</i>

<i>Are we fucking clear!</i>

And um,
you're coming to me now?

Now with this.

I'm sorry I just was really
trying to...

What?

You need to think about it?

I was just...
Scared?

You scared?

WALSH: Come on, come on,
she's here now.

Yeah, but we could have been
out there doing...

Zip it.

That bastard's dead.

But then why can't you
find him?

Listen, nobody human could even
survive that, okay.

Let's not be dumb.

What makes you think
he's human?

Oh my God, enough.

This is ridiculous.

Seriously.

Enough.

What's up?

Okay, all right, all right.

Come on, come on.
Mom, I wanna go.

That was Tora Carmichael,
wasn't it?

It's not your concern.

She was with Perry
that night,

the night that he went missing.

Everybody's talking about it.

You guys still haven't
found him, have you?

Oh, come on, take it easy.

No, but you know who he is,
right?

Perry is Ricky's little brother.

And you know exactly what
happened to Ricky.

Yeah, we know what happened
to Ricky.

Guess who did the paperwork?

Okay, and so how do you
know that psycho

doesn't have him right now?

Oh my God,
enough of this.

Listen, you need to look
at this, okay.

You see this?
Huh?

Okay, just... all right, stop.

No, you need to look at this,
Adrianna, okay

and get it through your head.

Damon is dead.
Okay, okay.

Officer, please just get these
away from me.

WALSH:
Kevin, put it away.

WALSH: Put it away.
KEVIN: Sheriff.

WALSH: You should've even have
those, come on.

PRICE: She needs to get this
out of her system.

WALSH: I'm just... that's an
order, put 'em away.

Oh, fine.
Come on.

Look at it.

Look at this shit.

Try to make an honest way
out there.

Without gambling other people's
money, handouts

sucking people dry, you know.

Good luck.

Now look.

Even if he did survive,

Tocho's thugs
would have finished him off.

They don't like leaving things
on unfinished.

Right?

And neither do I, okay.

As a matter of fact, Kevin,

go arrest that
son of a bitch.

Oh, from your lip, Sheriff.

I've been waiting for
those words all day.

As a matter of fact,
me and the Chief in a room

for about, I don't know,
10 minutes,

you're not even gonna need
an arraignment from this guy.

WALSH:
Hey!

Just pick him up,
like I said.

Okay, Kevin?

I've been... that's what
I've been trying to do

the whole time with pleasure.

So um,
you got any friends

you can talk about this with?

Nobody really understands it.

WALSH:
What um... what about um...

Javon?
WALSH: Yeah.

Yeah, he just likes
to make jokes

and never really wants to
talk about anything.

Give it time.

It'll pass.

Okay.

Hey, thanks for staying
so late, okay, Adrianna.

Sure.
WALSH: Appreciate it.

You need a lift home?

No, um, I think I'm good.

You good?

Yeah, have a goodnight.
Goodnight.

Yeah, you too.

This fucking guy.

WALSH:
I know.

JOHNNY:
Hey, how you doing?

Hi.

PRICE:
Wow.

Evening, officers.
WALSH: What are you doing?

JOHNNY:
Fucking gorgeous out, right?

What are you doing here, Johnny?

JOHNNY:
I'm loitering.

You're gonna bust me for it?

[Walsh chuckles]

PRICE: You know her?
Phew, I wish.

Not a lot of real life heroes
in this town.

Present company excluded,
of course.

You're fucking funny, Johnny.

Stay away from her, okay.

What are you her dad?

It's a free country,
Deputy Price.

Johnny, you want me
up your ass again,

'cause if you do,
just say the word.

Oh, you know,
as tempting as that sounds,

sounds like you want it
a lot more than I do.

But don't worry.

I won't tell your girlfriend
about it.

No stop!

Ah fuck!

Deputy Price!

Your hands are so firm
but soft.

I can't imagine
why your wife left you.

WALSH:
Deputy Price back up.

You might be hurting him.

Oh yeah,
am I might hurting him?


And the hair pulling, too.

You know just how I like it.

JOHNNY: I'm usually
on the other side though

I'll make an exception
for you.

PRICE:
Yeah, yeah.

Shut up!

I could end you whenever
I want, you know that.

And no one would know anything.

I beg to differ.

Your boss is right there.

He doesn't always see
everything Johnny.

So watch your fucking step,
greaseball.


I'm watching you.

All right, dad.

Anybody got a body cam?

Hey.
Shut the fuck up.


I was just about
to leave anyway.

WALSH: We're watching you,
we're watching you.

And I'm watching you, too.

WALSH:
Get out of here.

Get the fuck out of here,
Johnny.

What, you lost some speed, you
asshole.

Fucking pigs.

[Mimics pig squealing]

I really think
you're getting there

with the crow pose.

I don't know.

I felt like a baby
learning how to walk.

You've been to like
five classes.

Give it time.

I don't know, when am I gonna
stop being so sore?

Depends on the person, but
that's why we're here now.

Put in the work
and then numb the pain.

You think if I flash
the bartender,

he'll give us free drinks?


I don't know, maybe you should
ask your boyfriend.

Ooh hmm, you're sneaky.

Baby, this is my friend
Adrianna from yoga.

Yeah,
she's been talking about you.

She's not as bendy as me yet,

but she's a hot shot
wedding planner.

Yeah.

What do you say baby?

You wanna get married?


I don't know
if I can commit to someone

who goes around flashing
bartenders for alcohol.

Oh no, baby.

It's all top shelf.

Adrianna?

Adrianna!

Damn, how many have you had?

Sorry.

Don't even think about it.

That guy's a fucking creep.

Yeah, he's giving me
weird vibes.

Skins fish at the docks.

ZACK: Just like they say
he did to his ex-wife.

To be fair,
she was a royal bitch.

Hmm, emphasis on "was".

[Tina chuckles]

What?

Yeah, I haven't seen her
in months.

It's probably all bullshit,
but...

Cum-wad!

Why don't you go
take a shower, yeah,

and get the fuck out of here.

Anyways so, do you wanna do
a girl's trip this weekend?

Zack has family plans
and well, drinking alone

makes me feel like
an alcoholic.


Come on, let's be honest,
you kind of are an alcoholic.

I said feel like one.

Ah, I think that could be
lot of fun.

Uh, vacation rental?

Uncle's lake house actually.

He died last month
and well, I scored a key.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Oh, don't be.

He was a total prick,
but it was the best thing

he ever did for me.

Okay, so well where's
the place?

Black Raven.

Uh, yeah, um...

Don't worry.

It's not near Liberty Manor.

You won't even have to see
it on your way up.

Yeah, um, I don't know.

It'll be totally chill.

Think of it as a work trip.

What do you mean?

It's great for outdoor weddings.

And it's totally gorg during
the spring.

Come, check it out,
take some photos.

Your clients would love it.

[Indistinct chatter
in background]

Oh, my car just got here
actually.

Um, but I'll... I'll text you.

Hey, think about it.

ADRIANNA:
All right, I will.

Hey, I'll be right back.

You do know it's not nice
to stare, Johnny.

JOHNNY:
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

I wasn't even looking at you.

Oh, I know.

Adrianna had
your full attention.

Yeah, well, she's a TV star,
real life Wonder Woman.

I'm a big fan.

So, tell me Johnny,

You have the hots
for my friend?

This uh, doesn't do it
for you anymore?

I don't know, you seem pretty
taken, Blondie.

Hmm, that's never stopped you
before.

Well, I guess I have developed

a little self-control.


Keep telling yourself that.

I'm keeping my hands to myself,
all right.

For now,
but I can't help but notice

your little friend is betraying
the calm,

creepy cool thing you got going
in on there.

Well, if you noticed that,

it's probably not that little,
huh.

You know what I think, Johnny?

I think you have
Liberty Manor fetish.

Hot or cold?

Oh, you're burning the fuck up,
but you know what I think?

Hmm.

I think it takes one
to know one.

Hey, all those rumors about me
and my ex-wife,

all that shit that we used
to do together,

you know the kind of shit that
every other little boy

was way too pussy to try
with you.

Hmm.

You know I think you think
about that all the time.

In fact I think
you're thinking

about that right now.

Is that right?

Hmm.

Your boyfriend's waiting.

Shit!

<i>Chief Matty Tocho of the
Wampanoag Indian Tribe</i>

was arraigned in federal court
today

on 20 counts of federal
racketeering,

money laundering
and embezzlement.

He is also facing eight counts
of murder

and the conspiracy
to commit murder.

If convicted of all crimes,

Chief Tocho could be facing
multiple life sentences

with no chance of parole.

However, it is thought that
the prosecution will move

to seek the death penalty.

TV REPORTER: Chief Tocho has
currently pled not guilty

to all charges.

Oh my God!

What the fuck!
Get away from me!

Get away from me!

It's me, it's me,
it's me, Javon.

It's me.

What the fuck!

I'm sorry.

Where the hell did you even
get that thing?

I made it.

You made it?

Why?

My therapist,
she said uh,

personify the fear
and then, laugh at it.

That is seriously messed up.

It's working.

Not for me.

Thank you.

Mm.

Look, I'm sorry, okay.

I can't help but laugh.

Chase was my best friend.

It's like all I can do is laugh.

I know.

I'm sorry.

You did the right thing,
you know.

Ratting him out, right?

Excuse me, I'm really sorry to
bother you,

but would mind taking
a picture with my daughter?

Uh, sure.

Great, thanks.

Claire, get in there.

Now get right in.

Hi.

DENISE:
All right, squeeze in.

Okay, here we go.

Cheese.

1, 2, 3.

Cheese.

Oh.
Thanks.

Thank you so much.

I just want you to know
you're a real model.

She's a...
she's my role model, too.


Thank you.
Have a good one.

Phew.

Still fighting off
the paparazzi I see.

ADRIANNA:
I guess so.

So you ever wonder
how you did it?

Did what?

JAVON:
Survived.

The same way you did.

No, not the same.

I died just like everybody else
back there.

The doctors, Jesus,
they saved me,

but I died.

I don't understand.

You... you survived.

You went face to face
with the Chief

and then you killed Damon.

Damon could still
be out there.


Listen girl, that freak is
gone, okay.

And whether you pulled
the trigger or not,

he had it coming.

I mean you really think that
the Chief

was gonna let him live.

You don't know that.

You know Ricky's kid brother,
Perry,

do you know that
he's still missing?

JAVON:
Perry's a fuck-up.

Yeah, okay, but what if
the exact same...

No, what if, what if,

no there's no what-ifs,
Adrianna, okay?

JAVON:
That bastard is gone, okay.

And if he wanted us dead,
he'd come for us.


We'd end up just like them.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I gotta take a piss.

I'll be back.

For the table.

Oh, we didn't order that.

Oh, it's complimentary.

Why?

From an admirer.

Or at least that's what he
called himself.

From who?

He just left actually,
but he said

he wanted to stay anonymous.

But my mom said
she really likes this wine.

It's a bottle of Black Raven.

I don't wanna...

Can you just take it back
please?

Just... just take it back.

Yeah.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

JOHNNY: Hey, that's your girl
out there?

Do I know you, bro?

JOHNNY:
I knew it.

I'm just... I'm a big fan.

I uh... you don't know me,
but I know you.

I mean everybody knows, right?

Surviving the slaughterhouse
at Liberty Manor.

I get chills just thinking
about it.

I mean that's like a...
that's a defining moment,

don't you think?

Yeah, I... I guess.

Hey, leave that running,
I'm gonna jump right in.

Honestly,
fearing for your life

that's something most cats don't
get to experience.

Umm, yeah bro.

Whatever you say.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hey, what you doing?

I... I just got here.

Oh, I'm sorry,
I can't tonight, Javon.

Okay.

What about Saturday?

Uh, you know, I'm...
I'm going away with Tina

for the weekend actually.

She invited me upstate.

Tina...

Ooh, the one that puts those
booty videos on her socials.

Yeah, I know her.

Right, uh anyway um,

she asked me to go to her
uncle's house upstate

for the weekend.

Wait, what?

Uncle's house?

Another mansion
owned by rich white guy

in Black Raven?

JAVON: Let's think about this
for a second.

Come on, Javon.

How well do you even
know her?

Not as well as you do
apparently

with you following
her page like that.

Okay.

[Sarcastic laugh]

Look, I'm an ass guy.

That's beside the point, okay.

I'm worried this is gonna
trigger you.

You just said it best yourself.

Personify your fears
and then trivialize it.

Right?

Hmmm.

Yeah.

All right.

I'll text you later, okay.

ADRIANNA:
I'll be fine.

You say that now.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

PRICE: Got me down here in this
fucking smelly basement.

You're really messed up,
you know that, right?

Huh?

Hey.

You don't wanna talk, huh?

That's okay.

You know what,

I kind of like the quiet myself.

These guys here though,

they don't like quiet
so much.

So when you're ready, uh,

feel free to make as much noise
as you need to.

Oh yeah, I forgot,

I don't really think you can
hear too much down here.

Have fun, ladies.

So you like to hurt
little kids?

Hey, I'm talking to you!

Cowardly son-of-a-bitch!

Big bad Injun Chief?

TOMMY:
I'm fucking impressed.

You don't seem so tough
to me.

Come on, Tommy.

He's had enough!

He's had enough.

Get off me. Get off me!

Look at him, he's had enough!

Has he Billy?

TOMMY:
Have you, Chief?

Have you had enough?

The only good Indian
is a dead Indian.

Stop it, Tommy!

TOMMY: Are you seriously taking
this savage's side?

No.

TOMMY:
Why am I not surprised?

I said,
I'm not taking his side.

I just want you to stop.

Okay.

TOMMY:
Okay.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

This is nothing compared to
what you're gonna get

on the inside.

You're being transferred to
maximum security tomorrow,

Kemosabe.

That's when the real fun begins.

[Tocho coughs]

[Tommy spits]

TOMMY: Billy,
clean his ass up.

You made a mess.

Johnny, double-check we got
enough bait for tomorrow.

We're starting early.

Yeah actually,
I'm not gonna be in tomorrow

or the day after that.

I need a couple of days off.

What?

PETERS:
You never told me.

Well, I'm uh...
I'm kinda telling you now.

Sorry, Johnny.

We're barely making numbers
as it is.

I need you tomorrow.

PETERS:
Did you hear what I said?

Did you hear what I said?

It's two fucking days.

Well, if you said I don't want a
job anymore,

then yeah, I heard exactly what
you said.

Look, I've been working with
you for a long time.

I've done everything
you asked me to.

I'm asking for
two fucking days

and you're giving me
a problem.

You know what,
don't waste my fucking time.

You're fired.

Get the hell out of here.

Okay.

I just...
I gotta get my stuff.


Did you hear what I said?

I could come back on Monday
and get my checks

for two days off

or I could choke you
to death here

and nobody's gonna
fucking see it.

So what's it gonna be,
Captain?

What's it gonna be,
Captain?

Fucking go.

Go, go!

That's a good choice, Captain.

That's a good choice.

Fucking mutt.

You like tequila, right?

Yeah, sure.

I'm gonna make a quick run.

We've got a lot of stuff
at the house,

but feeling margaritas.

Yeah, sounds good actually.

Yeah.

Hey, I wanted to tell you
thanks for the invite.

You know, things have just
kind of been

sort of rough lately

and it's just nice
to get out.

Of course.


I honestly feel like
I'm already out of my head

and I kind of forgot
what that felt like.

Tacos.

Sounds good.

Adrianna?

That all for you, girlie?

Gotta make sure I don't get
thirsty tonight.


I don't know if you've seen
the news,

but he's going away
for a very long time.

You'll never have to
see him again, okay.

So you sleep any better?

Depends on the night.

You're not calling to check up
in on me

as much as you used to.

I'm not your dad.

Anyway, I'm here to help

and you have
my direct cell, so

use it, okay, honey.

Okay.

There's a party
in Black Raven later.

Oh, is that so?

Mhmm.

Wanna come?


Uh, time?

All night.

Really?

I really do appreciate
the invitation, young lady,

and uh... but I'm kind of
old enough to be your father.

Thank you, though.

Maybe I like that,
uh Victor.

You got ID?

You don't think I'm old enough
to party?

I wasn't sayin' that,
but there's a cop outside

and ID now.

Dominant.

Cute.

Now listen, now you uh...


you don't go too crazy tonight,
sweetheart, okay.

Have a good time.

You don't need to worry
about me, daddy.

And uh, keep the change.

If you wanna get that stick
out of your ass

and come later...

...that is where I'll be.

VICTOR:
Hey, hey, hello?

Hey, buddy, you gonna pay
for that?

Of course.

What, mom never let you have
snack in the store before?

Hey, man, I don't give a shit
about what your mom

didn't teach you, okay.

Oh, you talk that way
to a customer?

Hey, you're stealing right
in front of my face.

You ain't no customer.

What the fuck!

Well now, technically
I haven't left the store yet,

so I didn't steal anything,
but I bet you if I was

shaking my ass
in front of your face...

All right.

You'd probably give me some
better customer service.

Well, here's an idea.

Why don't you
get the hell out

of my fucking store, okay!

No, we don't need to have
this conversation.

All right,
why don't you make me?


I see it.

The darkness in you,
I see it.

Oh, you do, do you?

Yeah, and I feel it.

Whatever you're thinking,
whatever you're planning,

yeah, there's another path,
my brother.

Trust me when I tell you
I have been there.

Thank you.

I'm sorry, thank you.

Yeah, that hundred
she gave you,

should be enough to cover
the nips

and that shit advice.

Have a nice suck!

WALSH:
Look at that.

Tina.

You two know each other?

We've met once or twice.

A few times actually.

So those bottles

they stay sealed
until you get

where you're going, right?

Mhmm.

All right,
you stay out of trouble.

Both of you.

Especially you.

Okay.

Let's go.

Sure.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Woah, dude, slow down.

You wanna have some fun today?

TINA:
Come on, it's fun.

Tina, Tina, Tina,
please God.

Look, I can drive
with my knees.

ADRIANNA:
Jesus.

Tina, oh my God!

Come on, Tina, get over.

Tina, Tina.

I just need you to get over!

Stop!
ADRIANNA: What!

TINA: talm down!

What are you doing?

Calm down.

You said you wanted
to have fun today.

You almost killed us there.
TINA: You're gonna kill us.

Are you kidding me, dude?

Let's have some fun.
ADRIANNA: Jesus.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ADRIANNA:
Wow, Tina.

This place would be fit
for a wedding.

TINA:
Right, I told you.

ADRIANNA:
Beautiful here.

Do you trust me now?

I guess, starting to.

Okay.

Hey, I think I know
that guy.

TINA:
Really?

Yo, Greene.

You know my friend here?

Yeah, you used to know
Chase Larsen.

And you know, I was the...
the groundskeeper

for the Larsens.

And respectfully,

you should not be on these
grounds.

Excuse me?

[Chuckles lightly]

GREENE:
Tina?

You know...


Tina, before your uncle died,
he had it in his will

that no one should visit
these grounds

until the estate was settled.

[Tina chuckles]

GREENE:
And it's not settled.

Interesting.

Well, let me be equally
as clear.

Bardley's the last name
on your check.

And my last name is Bardsley,
so my friend is staying.

Okay, thanks.

Go back to your uh, raking.

You're making a mistake.

Both of you.

Come on.

You have to see this.

It's perfect for pictures.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Billy Horton?

TOCHO:
Really?

Officer Horton.

Is there a problem?

No problem,
Billy Blackhawk.

TOCHO:
Yeah, I knew your father, Mato.

And his father.

You descend from great men.

Thank you.

TOCHO: It's a pity
where you ended up.

Don't.


Was saddened to heard that your
family lost their land.

It was a travesty.

My parents never really
got over that.

The trail of tears continues to
wind its way

through the present.

Would your family be proud
of you, Officer Horton?

I changed my name,

because Billy Horton
is gonna get promoted

a lot faster than
Billy Blackhawk, okay.

TOCHO: You can't change
who you are, Billy.

You think if I changed
my name,

your boss wouldn't have been so
rough on me?

Look, what he did was wrong.

Our blood is the same, Billy.

We're family.

F... you killed kids.

TOCHO:
I didn't kill anyone.

You gave the order.

That... that's the same
fucking thing.

You should've gone to
the fucking police.

TOCHO:
And what?

Get an earlier start
on my facial

reconstructive surgery?

They're... they're...
they're not all like that.

TOCHO: Jesus, you're so goddamn
naive, Billy.

You'll never be one of them.

They won't let you.

Stop talking.

If you send me to prison,

my blood will be
on our hands.

I got no other choice.

TOCHO:
You can let me go free.

You want to.

I can sense it.

No.

TOCHO:
Do the honorable thing, Billy.

Let me go.

I'll lose my job.

TOCHO:
Come work for me.

Just shut up!

Okay!

Just shut up!

Goddamn!

Fuck!

TOCHO: We can make it look like
a struggle.

Make yourself at home.

Mi casa, su casa.


It's beautiful here.

Yeah, I dated
this exchange student

from Spain, he was so hot.

Everything okay?

Yeah, it just... this place kind
of reminds me

of little bit
of Liberty Manor.

It's weird, you know,
being back in Black Raven.

Come here, baby.

You need to relax.

Let me take care of you,
I'm a great hostess,

I promised.

Okay.

Oh, you're gonna love this.

Come on.

Wow.

Right?

That's incredible.

A couple of drinks out here
will put your mind

at ease, girlfriend.

Works every time.


TINA: It's so nice here
in the summer.

Too bad it's too cold
to go swimming.

Yeah, but I didn't bring
a bathing suit.

You could have skinny dipped.

Wanna see my favorite room?

Okay, keep your eyes closed.

Eyes closed,
we're almost there.

Okay, ready?

Mhmm.

Open.

What the fuck, Tina?

It's sick, right?

This is everything that came
from Liberty Manor.

Where did you get this?

Well, Larsens closed up shop,
and well,

we took everything
off their hands.

Some of this stuff is really
fucking valuable,

but they didn't want anything
to do with it.

Yeah, no shit.

I mean look at it.

It's fucking dope.

We have it all here.

Except for the ring.

Yeah.

You don't know
where it is, do you?

Can we get it?

Listen to me carefully,
Tina.

All of this stuff is cursed.

It's haunted.

You don't want the ring,
and you don't want

any of this stuff.

Yeah but you haven't even seen
the best item here yet.

My uh, prized possession.

Where did you get that?

I saw you.

What?

On the beach, burying it.

No, no, no, Tina you should not
have taken that.

You should not have
done that.

It's just a mask.

You killed the creep.

He was the threat.

Not that thing.

Don't tell me what I know
and what I don't know.

That mask is cursed.

Bullshit.

Are you kidding me?

Everything in here is cursed,

and it all started
with that ring.

Tell me what happened.

Let go of me.

Where were you the first time
you saw him?

The first time
you saw Damon?

What?
Who did he kill first?

Stop it.

It wasn't all about the ring.

He enjoyed the killings, right?

Why are you doing this?

Because I need to know.

Is this why you brought me here?

Who's that?

Let the fun begin.

TOMMY:
Butchie?

Where's my Butchie boy?

Daddy's home.

Butchie?

Where's my big boy?

Got your favorite.

Butchie.

[Tommy whistles]

Butchie boy.

Where's my big boy?

Butchie?

Shit, Price!
Whoa, whoa.

Relax.

How'd you get in here?

Hello, with the key
like you told me.

What are you talking about?

You just sent me a text
on your burner phone

said you met with Tocho.

What's going on?

I still don't know what you're
talking about

and I ain't got
no burner phone.

No, well I do.

No, no, stop.

Not supposed to be
in here, no.

Can't hear you, man.

Hi beautiful.

Hi baby.

Ms. Bardsley, Tina?

You know that no one is
supposed to be in here.

Tina, is that how you're gonna
say hi to me, too?

If you want me to.

Get a couple drinks in me
and we'll see what happens.

I would not be opposed
to that.

TINA:
What's up, Spencer baby?

SPENCER:
Looking good, Tina.

Is that why you want me
to make out

with your girlfriend?

Doesn't hurt.

[Tina chuckles]

Ms. Bardsley, I... I were...

Mr. Greene,

if you wanted to be a part
of the fun,

all you had to do is ask.

Oh no, I don't want that.

It's not what I want.

I know it's not your scene.

Yo guys, this is my new
yoga bestie, Adrianna.

Hey guys.

Oh shit.

You're that chick from TV.

The killer.

Stone cold.

Bad ass.

I love true crime.

Ms. Bardsley, may I have
a word with you?

Goddammit.

Zack, can you go show them
the rest of the house?

Of course, baby.

ZACK: All right, guys,
come on, let's go.

Come on.

Good luck with all that.

His intentions were
not to have any onlookers

or interlopers.

No one should...

Enough.

You work for me,
you got it?

I worked for your uncle,
you spoiled bitch.

Excuse me?

My uncle's dead.

You work for
Bardsley Holdings LLC.

Last time I checked,
I'm the only Bardsley

in 50-mile radius
in this town.

Your ass is mine this weekend,
you got it?

I said, you got it?

Get away from me,
you stupid bitch!

What is wrong with you?

Oh my God, calm down.

You're fucking fired!

I'm sorry.

I want him gone.
I get it, get out of here.

I got it.

What the fuck was that?

I'm very sorry,
I will go talk to her,

I need this job.

No, no, not happening.

That's a really bad idea.

I think you just need
to stay here, calm down,

go back to wherever you live
on this property,

and I'll talk to her
in the morning.

I meant what I said.

None of you should be in
Black Raven,

especially you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Tommy groans]

Look at me.

I need your help.

And I don't have much time.

Do as I say
and you won't end up like,

what'd you call him,
"Butchie boy".

[Tommy mumbles]

TOCHO:
Shut up!

I need you to track a number
at the police station.

The name is Adrianna Reyes.

Nod yes if you understand.

Good.

I'm going to remove your gag.

If you make trouble,
I'll break your fucking neck.

Again, nod yes
if you understand.

This is CO Tommy Flanagan.

Badge number 5237909.

I need to track a cell phone.

The number is 203-555-1501.

The name is Adrianna Reyes.

OPERATOR (ON PHONE): The cell
phone is tracked

to 4115 Redwood Circle, Black
Raven.

Thank you.

I did what you asked.

You're right.

Seems I have no use
for you anymore.

Don't, don't.


You know what they say?

The only good racist piece of
trash is a dead one.

[Price groans]

You know you really messed up
this time, right?

Yeah, you don't need to
answer that.

PRICE:
Fuck you.


Well, if you insist.

You have no fucking clue
who you're messing with.

You know I thought about
leaving your corpse

recognizable
for your family,

but now I'm not so sure.

Yeah.

Fat boy, what the fuck are you
gonna do?

KITCHI: You want us to clean
this up, Chief?

It's too messy to make it look
like

they did it to themselves.

Leave it.

They'll know it was me
sooner or later.

Perfect timing.

Adrianna, here.

Thanks.

I hope that creepy Mr. Greene
didn't try to make

a move on you.

I don't think he's actually seen
tits since 2003.

No, he was fine.

I know he's a little eccentric,

but I think he was really sorry
at the end of it.

Too little too late
for that.

Hey, are... are you okay?

It's just
I wasn't expecting this.

Them?

They're so chill, I promise.

I just felt like you needed
a little party.

I know you would have said
no if I asked.

It's not just that.

What do you mean?

Tina, that room,
with all of that stuff.

I get intense, I know.

Intense?

You had me pinned up
against a wall.

But I really love curses
and legends,

and haunted houses,
and all that shit.

Yeah, and I get that,
but I almost died

at Liberty Manor.

So I get why Mr. Greene's
weirded out by all of this.

I'm sorry I didn't mean
to trigger you.

I just, I felt like maybe
it would help you, you know.

It would help you get over
your fear.

Yeah.

You're right.

Maybe I should just loosen up
and have a good time.

Plus, you can write
a tell-all book

and make a shit ton of money.

And I'll only ask
for 10 percent,

Shut up.


Are we good?

I think so.

Good.

Hey ladies,
come on let's party,

let's go.

Hey guys what's up?

Let's fucking do it.

Yeah, let's go bro.


TINA:
I got the bottle.

You gotta give
her a cup, man.

A little for you,
a little for you,

can't forget you.


All right.

ZACK:
Babe.

Oh, did you want some?

Yeah, I want some.

But I have the bottle.

Well, you should give it
to me.

And why is that?

'Cause you just gave it
to everyone else.

Maybe I wanna make you
work for it.

Yeah.

ZACK: Yeah?
TINA: Yeah.

Hey.

Hi, what's your guys'
names again?

Sonja.

Spencer.

Cool.

Adrianna.

Again.

We know.

Big fans.

Seems like everybody is
these days.

SONJA:
Are you tired of it?

It's just,

I never really asked for it
is all.

Better that than the
alternative though, right?


Being dead I mean.

Well, obviously, it's just...
no, you're right.

I'm very thankful

and I'm just gonna
have a good time, right.

Y'all are depressing.

Yup.


TINA:
Let's party, people.

First, I have a few house rules.

You do whatever you want,
whenever you want

to freaking do it, okay.

No questions asked.

No permission
is ever necessary.

You break something,
you freaking buy it, okay.

ZACK:
Or just hide it really well.

That's true.

Fuck the world, we're having a
great-ass time.

We are alive
and we are thriving.

Let's take a freaking shot
to that.


Yeah, let's go.


Sounds good.

TINA:
Yes!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Damon whistling]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[Taking deep breaths]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Fuck.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Uh, you want a roughing?

Yeah, baby.

Yeah.

Just keep looking sexy.

Let's get this off.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Boo!

Jesus Christ!

ADRIANNA:
Jesus, oh my God.

I just wanted to have
a little fun with you.

Why the hell do you people
keep doing that?

I'm sorry,
I'm just screwing around.


ADRIANNA:
It's not funny.

And neither was this afternoon.

Look, I know
you're into weird shit

and everything like that.

But it's really
not working for me.

I honestly think that
I should just go home.

No, no, no, no.

Don't do that.

Let me make it up to you.

Tina.

What are you doing?

Tina, come on.

[Indistinct speech]

I can't.

You already are.

Look, I'm sorry, I... I...
I... I really can't do this.

You can't do what?

I'm going back to bed, okay.

And it's alone.

No.

I'm sorry.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hey, hey, sorry uh,
sorry to bug you,

you're the maintenance guy,
right?

Yeah, do I know you?

Oh yeah, yeah,
I'm a... well, not personally,

but I'm up with the kids
at the house

at the party, yeah.

I locked myself out,
they're in there

blasting the music partying
and I'm banging on the door,

nobody can hear me.

Do you have like a spare key

or anyway I can get
in the house?

It's 4:00 a.m.
and I'm off duty.

So, no.

Yeah, it did get late, huh.

Um...

Hey, I'm... I'm... I'm so
embarrassed uh to bug you

but there's no garage code
or anyway I can get in?

I can't do that.

All right.

Well, I'm... I'm sorry
to bug you,

I'll let you get back
to your thing

and but you... you might hear
from me again,

because I'm gonna try and bang
on the door louder,

but if they don't hear me,

I'll have to come back
and uh...

Here, I'll give you
the heads up.


Oh, what's that?

Oh, you do have a key.


Oh, and I can use it.

Oh, you're such a lifesaver,
thank you so much.

Thank you so much, brother.

Come on, wake up.

Oh God.

Okay.

You ready?

Here we go.

Hey Javon, it's me.

I got real shitty service
up here,

so we may get cut off.

JAVON (ON PHONE):
<i>What time is it?</i>

It's late or early.

You know, you're right.

I shouldn't have
come up here.

JAVON (ON PHONE):
<i>I told you.</i>

ADRIANNA: Do you think you could
come get me?

JAVON (ON PHONE):
<i>What's wrong?</i>

Nothing.

I just... I really just want
to come home.

JAVON (ON PHONE): <i>Okay, I'll be
there tomorrow.</i>

Thanks, I appreciate that.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I'm going back
to the station.

I'll get these pictures
to you soon or...

Okay, thanks.
Okay, thanks.

One was there.
Mhmm.

He was a corrections officer?

Yeah, one of the two guys
holding Tocho.

Oh Price, I told you not to
get mixed up in this shit.

Patrol's out.

We'll find him.


Well, thanks, partner.

Tocho forced the van
off the road

during the transfer.

We found him tied to a tree
off of Exit 4.

He's alive but he's beaten up
pretty bad.

What was his name?

The partner?

Yeah.

Blackhawk,
well, he goes by Horton now.

Wampanoag tribe?

DETECTIVE:
I think so.

Tocho knew to come to this
apartment right here.

He murdered a cop,

he killed his own
fucking dog.

You really think he'd have left
any witnesses?

No.

Thanks.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Well, hello, sleeping beauty.

ADRIANNA:
Morning.

[Both chuckle]

What?

Morning ended a while ago.

Sunset's in like three hours.

Yeah, you've been sleeping
all day.

What?

TINA: Usually Greene wakes
everyone at dawn

with his fucking leaf blower,

but haven't seen his sorry ass
all day.

ZACK: Guess we finally scared
him off?

[Tina chuckles]

I thought you guys were gonna
try to work it out.

TINA: I guess he came to his
senses and decided to leave.

It's better this way,
trust me.

Uh yeah,
actually I think I'm gonna do

the same and head out.

ADRIANNA: My friend's coming to
pick me up tonight.

Wait, wait.

Why?

I honestly just don't think
I'm in the mood

for everything and I don't want
to ruin the party.

You guys are having
so much fun.

Hey, hey,
that's what we're here for.

I know I haven't been making
you feel as comfortable

as I wanted, but...

It's... it's not that.

I just...

I... I really just think
I should go.

No, no.

No buts.

I made you a drink.

Zack, Zack.

To life.

To life.

Well, we could at least
have some fun

till your friend comes.


Cheers.
SONJA: Yes.

It's gonna be a good weekend.

Look what I got.

[Spencer laughs]

Will you light this for me?
Of course.

What the hell is that?

You want some of that?

TINA:
Take it while it's hot.

Hey, be careful with that stuff
though.

It's really strong.

[Spencer coughs]

[Tina laughing]

I'm serious, take it easy.

Hey, come on,
let me get some, man.

My turn.

Sonja, what's a secret you've
never told anyone before?

Hmm, I cheated on Spencer.

Wait, what?

With Zack.

[Zack coughs]

Here.

[Tina laughs]

Two weeks ago.

Are you fucking serious
right now?

No.

I think it's kind of hot.

Sonja?

No, I'm just fucking
with you.

ZACK:
Oh my God.


That shit's not funny.

Okay, okay, okay.

Adrianna, it's your turn.

You have to take a hit of that
first though.

And Adrianna,
don't be a buzzkill.

Be nice.

She's always a buzzkill.

Whoa, fuck you, Zack.


What else?

Tina, tell me, what is your
most secret sexual fantasy?

I'm not sure I have any
that are left.

[Zack chuckles]

Aah, you're welcome.

Yeah, too boring for you,
you know what's up.

You see I like to live life
on the edge.

Sex is like life,

without a little bit of danger,

you might as well be dead.

Want some danger, baby?

Hmm.

I want some danger.

Fuck this.

Fuck your ass.

SPENCER:
Fuck them!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Good.

Get me Adrianna.

Do what you want
with the others

but bring me the girl.

MATO: Yes, Chief.
Alive!

She's mine!

I... I... I don't know
who I am.

But you do remember
what you did?

No?

I think you do.

WALSH:
Just say it.

I... I can't.

I'm gonna give you 60 seconds
to get your story straight.

Walsh.

DONNA (ON PHONE): <i>I checked the
number you gave me.</i>

Yeah, and go ahead.

DONNA (ON PHONE): <i>4115 Redwood
Circle, Black Raven.</i>

Black Raven.

Thanks, Donna.

DONNA (ON PHONE):
<i>Sure thing.</i>

<i>She's a popular girl.</i>

How do you mean?

DONNA (ON PHONE): <i>You're the
second cop</i>

<i>looking for her today.</i>

Flanagan?

DONNA (ON PHONE):
<i>You got it.</i>

<i>Called late this afternoon.</i>

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Bullshit.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Ah!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Taking deep breaths]

Ah, '84.

A fine year.

Good vintage indeed.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


Okay, okay, Tina.

Your turn.

Okay.

Ask a question.

Adrianna.

Tina...

What's your biggest fear?

That my memories won't fade.

Oh, that's dark.

Well, that's why we make
new ones.

Come on, baby, I want you
so fucking bad right now.

You better take care
of your man, Tina

or I might just have to.

This will literally take
two seconds.

That happened one time.

It happens every time.

It's your fault.

Seems so whipped,
it's ridiculous

So whipped.

Go make me a drink, baby.

[Zack chuckles]

No, I'm not kidding,

go make me a margarita.

Later, baby.

No, I'm not having
sex with you

unless you make me
a margarita.

What?

Really?

You're not gonna have sex
with me

if I don't make you
a margarita?

Yeah.

[Zack chuckles]

I'll be right back.

TINA:
What took you so long?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


Wait, put the mask on.

Yeah.


Are you afraid?

So afraid.

Margaritas.

Fuck, so stupid.

[Indiscernible speech]

I bet you.

Aha.

Nice.

I'm gettin' laid.

Haha.

Mr. Greene?

Oh, come on, man,
are you drunk again?

Seriously man, bad timing.

You were the biggest cock block
I have ever met.

Come on, man, let's go.

Hey, Mr. Greene,
come on.

Oh fuck!

Oh shit.

Oh, fuck this!

Oh fuck.

Hey, can I ask you something?

Sure.

How do you know Tina?

College.

SONJA:
Same sorority.

Has she always been so...

Nuts?

I was gonna say more like...

You can say it.

You're not wrong,
she's harmless.

SONJA: Just likes to have
a good time.

Yeah.

I'm starting to get that now.

What about you?

Having fun?

SONJA: I know we kind of
blindsided you.

Yeah, I mine it's fine.

I just, kind of needed some
time to adjust.

Listen I'm gonna take a few
more minutes in here,

but let's chat later.

Okay.

I'll see you inside.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ZACK:
Tina!

Zack, hey.

Hey, what's going on?

I don't... Mr. Greene's dead.

Dead? What the hell
do you mean?

I don't know either.

What the hell was that?

What's going on?

I don't know, I'm trying to
make...

What the hell is going on, guys?

Adrianna!

Javon!

What the fuck is going on?
Oh shit.

[Overlapping speech]

No, no, no.

That's not him!

What are you doing?
That's my friend!

Get off me!

Get the fuck off!
That's my friend!

What the fuck, bro!

You just attacked my girl,
motherfucker.

No, I didn't.

What are you talking about?

Javon, what are you doing?

JAVON: What are you talking
about? I came to pick you up.

I just saw the mask.
Where did you put it?

What?
The mask you made.

Where did you put it?

Y'all are tripping.

I left that shit
at the restaurant.

Then what the hell
are you doing here, man?

I came to pick up Adrianna.

Listen, whatever is going on,
whatever you think I did,

I didn't do.

Then who did it?

Johnny Discenzo.

My ex-boyfriend.

Well, ex-fuck buddy.

ADRIANNA:
What?

How did he know you were here?

I invited him.

Are you kidding me?

I wanted to spice things up,
create a little adventure.

For our special guest here.

ADRIANNA:
What does that even mean, Tina?

I thought it'd be dope
to recreate Liberty Manor.

This is not some
kind of fucking game.

Life's a game, sweetie.

ZACK: You slept with him,
didn't you?

That fucking low-life!

You kept saying you wanted
to watch,

what is the big deal?

Okay, this is way too much
for me right now.

That guy Greene is fucking
dead, because of you.

Mr. Greene is a loser
with no family, no friends,

and no life.

Nobody will miss him.

How the hell can you even
say that?

It's true.

So what are you gonna say
that it's me next

or Zack or Spencer or...

You guys, where's Spencer?

You guys, who is Spencer?

What you're doing
is sacrilege.

Oh, the... the mask,
this is uh...

no, this is a... it is a toy.

I got this
at a Halloween's store.

Yeah, yeah, look, look, look,
it's made of plastic.

It's not even real.


Oh shit.

[Mato shouts]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

She's not answering.

Tocho's making a play
for Adrianna,

Morgan, I can feel it.

Yeah, look, we just got to get
there first,

okay.

Yeah.

Fuck.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Spencer.

Just wanted to come back,
right, just say something.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh my God, what the fuck!

How did we miss this?

Oh my God, Javon!

Gross.

Adrianna,
what the fuck is it?

What the hell do you think
is happening,

you crazy bitch!

You wanted Liberty Manor,
you got it.

No.

ZACK:
Everyone get a hold of this.

This is all your fault.

I can't even, what the fuck is
wrong with you?

I did not want this
to happen.

ADRIANNA: The hell did you think
was gonna happen?

I just wanted to have
a fun weekend

with my friends.

You think this is fun?
TINA: No.

You know what?
I'm outta here.

My friends are dying.

TINA:
No, you can't leave me.

I'm not gonna take that shit
laying down.

Zack, where are you going?

Zack, no!

ADRIANNA:
Zack, no.

What did I do?


Hey Morgan,
I just found Adrianna's car.

Yeah, Adrianna's car.

She's here at um,
Morgan?

Morgan?

Fuck!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Zack, Zack, Zack?


No.

Fuck!

Zack, oh my God.

Thank God.

I got him.

ADRIANNA:
Thank God.

But he got me, too.

ADRIANNA:
What?

No, no, no.

Oh my God, Zack,
no, no, no.

Zack!

[Indiscernible speech]

No, don't touch me!

Time for you to pay.

You think you can slay
a great nation of warriors.

And just walk away?

No, I don't think so.

You're a coward!

You and the Chief.

It was never
about the ring, was it?

Does it satisfy
your blood lust?

Well, if it's blood
you want...

[Mato shouts]

ADRIANNA: Javon!
Run, Adrianna.


Javon.

No.

No, no.


JAVON:
Adrianna!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Stay calm,
just drop the weapon

or I'll blow your brains out.

Drop the weapon.

Drop the weapon.

Now don't move,
right there.

Where's Tocho and his goons?

Start talking to me right now
or I'll blow your heart

out of your chest.

GOON 1:
Don't think so.

Really?

You don't think so.

Don't you wish you had,
you dead bitch.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Tina crying]

Oh my God, oh my God.

She's dead, she's dead.

[Overlapping speech]

We have to go.

Let's go!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


Kitchi!

[Adrianna screams]

Get over here.

Don't touch me.

Don't let her get away.

No!

No!

Don't touch me.

No!

No!

Get off of me!

Get off of me!

Get off!

[Unclear speech]

No.

Fucking die,
you fucking bitch.

[Adrianna screams]

[Adrianna gasps]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Adrianna!

Adrianna, where are you?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Relish these few moments
of peace, Adrianna.

I have exacted my revenge.

Does that mean it's over?

Can you predict the future?

Can you separate the future
from the past?

Is it over?

Today is over, my child.

But tomorrow,
it's just begun.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

WALSH:
Adrianna?

Here.

Here, right here.

I'm here.


It's over.

It's over.


It's over, it's over.

It's over, shh.


It's over.

[Walsh shushing]

WALSH: I got you now, it's over
honey, it's over.

It's over.

It's over, okay.

Come now, shh.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

My people have long said

that when you seek revenge

you should first dig two graves.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

but there is honor in death.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

And we derive strenght till we
the defeat

of our enemies.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

As our enemies are all around us

to give in...

to conform...

to capitulate.

But there is no honor in that.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

And for the weak

even death

could not bring
a peaceful sleep.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

The future is calling
some of us.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

But death...

is waiting for all of us.
