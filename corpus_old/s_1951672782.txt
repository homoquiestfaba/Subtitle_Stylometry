The Mandarin!

Yeah. Looks like we're gonna need
someone else on the temple.

Mr. Rhodey! Mr. Rhodey.

It 's Mr. Rhodes, or just Rhodey.
Not both. Remember?

The rains are nearly upon us,
and you are very far behind schedule.

Not my fault.

If the underground rivers
continue to swell...

the ruins will collapse!
Mr. Tony promised you would...

You wanna blame someone?
Try the Jade Dragons!

Their little "commando" raids
have cost us weeks!

That is a security issue.
And Mr. Tony promised us...

I know! He promised
a lot of things.

What happened?
You were due yesterday.

Inspections in Shanghai.

One more strip search
and my price goes way up!

Mr. Rhodey!

Mr. Ling, it 's gonna be fine, really.

We now have enough liquid steel to
start pumping it under the excavation.

But will it be enough
to raise it safely above the ground?

Look, it 's a sound plan, and I'll do
my best. That 's all I can promise.

Our gratitude, Mr. Rhodey.

I got that one.

Ah, Tony!

Chocolates and lady fingers.
My favorite.

Rhodey, I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

We got hit! Again!

How are the ruins?
Any damage?

The ruins? No. And I'm fine, too.
Thanks for asking.

Hey. I knew you'd be okay.
You just don't get it, do you?

These lunatics
mean business, Tony.

Better finish dessert without me.
I'm gonna have to take this.

Okay. So what happened?
We can't defend ourselves...

...that 's what happened.
We've been overthis, Rhodey.

Yeah. And I'm guessing that 's why you
bumped the weapons from the cargo.

What are you talking about?
I didn't authorize any weapons.

You went behind my back?
What choice did I have?

The closerwe are to raising
the Mandarin's temple...

the closerwe are to getting our butts
blown off by those crazy zealots!

The Jade Dragons
aren't trying to kill anybody...

but if guns get thrown into the mix,
people will die.

So, you're telling me
you didn't KO the shipment?

No. Would I have? Yes.

Because I knew
they'd most likely be stolen.

Look, one way or another,
I gotta get some support here.

All right, Rhodey, I'll fly over.

You said that last week,
and the week before that.

This time I promise. I'll clear
my schedule. Just hang in there.

Now it 's time for something
that really needs my attention.

Pepper, darling,
you look concerned. Am I late?

Forty minutes.
And they're not happy.

So what else is new?
I say we keep it casual today.

Smudged lipstick might be
a little too casual.

Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen.

Okay, I take it we're not here
to form a company softball team.

Cavalier as always, Mr. Chairman.

This is just one more example
of how little respect...

Tony Stark has for this company
and its shareholders.

Ah, the shareholders. You know,
I bet they'd love a softball team.

That 's right, Tony, laugh it off.
Just like you do everything else.

Well, let 's see how funny
you think this is.

We're correcting
a grave mistake today.

Remind me, which mistake is this?

Handing you your own
Advanced Technologies Division.

It was a colossal error in judgment
giving you that much freedom.

Need I not remind this, I was against
that decision from the very beginning!

You need not.
Then let me get to the point.

You're being charged
with gross malfeasance.

On what grounds?

Let 's try your little excavation
in China...

with a price tag of $ 226 million,
and climbing.

You not only agreed to do this
without board approval...

you're doing it all for free!

You wanna know about China?
Call it a gesture of goodwill.

But their government is so grateful,
that they've just awarded us...

contracts worth twenty times
what we're spending over there.

Here, look them over.
I think you'll be quite impressed.

Now, is there anything else?

How about the half a billion dollars
you've spent so far...

on some secret project?
Again without board approval!

Believe me, what I've been working on
is the future of this company.

A company that my innovations
have built into an empire...

making every person
at this table indecently rich.

Despite the fact that this board
has done nothing, but get in my way.

It is our job to control
loose cannons!

Just as it 's our job
to cut them loose!

What are you saying?
Mr. Chairman...

I motion that Tony Stark
be relieved of his duties...

and that his division
be shut down.

You can't do that!
I second.

Dad! Say something.

All in favor say: "Aye".

Aye!

You want my father to drive
this company on his own?

Because he will,
right into the ground!

It was the right decision, Howard.

Relax and enjoy the show, gentlemen.

Today you get to witness a 3,OOO
year old city rise from the dead.

Okay, let 's do this.

Commencing infusion
of Liquid FiberSteel.

Looking good.
Five seconds to maximum dispersion.

Three, two, one.

All stop.

Initiate sonic bombardment.

Gentlemen, what's happening here
is that sonic vibrations...

are causing the liquid
steel to expand.

Kind of like cotton candy
orsteelwool.

When we cease the sonic
bombardment, the steel will harden.

See these foundation balloons?

As they begin reaching
full capacity...

they'll push up against
the base of the excavation...

and raise your ancient city
to ground level.

After that, my friends,
it 's there to stay.

Move!

Li Mei!

I have told you,
I will not take innocent lives.

I decide what lives are innocent!

And anyone involved
in the raising of that city is not.

And now, you will take
as many lives as I command...

or I will take yours.

East and West have joined
in preserving...

an important part of our heritage.

Too bad not everybody agrees
that 's a good thing.

You must understand...

the Mandarin's was the darkest,
most violent of all dynasties.

Hundreds of thousands died
under his brutal reign.

But that's ancient history.

Some fear that by raising his temple,
it is inviting history to repeat itself.

What do you think?

Many will pay tribute to this place
and prosperity will follow.

To me, that is a good thing.

Go! Run!

Pepper, you minx.

You just couldn't stand it any longer,
could you?

The ruins in China
were attacked again.

Tell Rhodey I'm dealing with
a crisis here. I'll fly out when I can.

Tony, Rhodey's missing.

What?
And the workers, they're all dead.

What do you want from me?
Not you. Tony Stark.

Sir, we have an
obstruction ahead.

I don't care. Just detour around it,
and get me to the dig site.

Yes, Sir. Go right.
We're taking the side street.

This isn't right.
Streets here are never empty.

Back up! Back up!
Move! Move!

Go, go, go!

Tony!

My God! What have you done?
You butchers!

Will he live?

For the moment.

But his heart has suffered
great damage.

Understand me, old man.
If he dies, you die!

Oh man! We gotta do something
to keep him alive.

You are a man of medicine?

An army medic.
But that was a long time ago.

It 's just gonna have to do.

You dare show concern
for that man?!

He may have doomed us all!

I'll never understand why you do not
show such courage on the battlefield.

There is much about me
you will never understand!

I would advise you not to lose sight
of your responsibility, Li Mei!

My responsibility is the only thing
that keeps me here!

Master Chu! Four Elementals
have awakened!

Where are they now?

They've risen into the sky, and set off
upon their quest for the rings!

I hear something.

Howard, listen.
Tony's disappearance, as...

painful as it 's, may be the best thing
for the company.

You know, you lawyers are all alike.
That 's my son you're talking about!

Even so, you need to hear this.

I've been contacted by the Chinese
government. They've got questions.

Like how our weapons ended up
in the hands of known radicals.

They can't blame Tony for that!

Let them blame whoever they want.

Because if they start
looking at you...

the board's gonna throw you
to the wolves.

I don't believe that!
It 's my company!

It 's a public company.

Don't think for a second they won't do
whatever's necessary to protect it.

Tony. Easy, man.
Just relax.

Ho Yin! That 's right. You're gonna
be okay, buddy. Just breathe.

What happened?

You were attacked.
It got pretty bad, man.

What! Rhodey?

Sorry, Tony, but this hardware's
all that 's keeping you alive.

You saved my life?
No... he did.

Thank you.

How is he?

Ask him yourself.

Tony, meet Li Mei. The only
decent soul in this den of cutthroats.

Pardon me for not getting up.
I am happy to see you are alive.

That makes two of us.

Thank you.

Li Mei, can you tell me...
why are we prisoners?

I must go.

Well, that 's a first...
you scared off a woman.

Easy to do when you look
like Frankenstein.

How about we find a way
to streamline this a bit?

Your weakness sickens me!

If only I possessed
your strength.

Then you would be my son,
instead of my disgrace!

I'm sorry, Father.
Do not call me that!

I am angry, Li Mei! I am angry
that when the Mandarin rises...

it is you who will face him, not me!

It was my right!
I do not want this life.

Your life means nothing! You are
on this earth to serve another purpose!

Either serve with honor,
or next time do not fail!

...amateurvideo shot by tourists
revealing powerful entities...

The Elementals have the first ring.
We are running out of time!

But Tony Stark
has not yet recovered.

He's well enough.
We must begin... now!

Hey, Tony.
Rhodey...

we have to figure out
what they plan to do with us.

Whatever it is,
it ain't gonna be good.

In the end...

Wong Chu will kill you.

No doubt.

Why are the Jade Dragons
so up in arms?

What you have accomplished
in months...

they have spent 3,OOO years
trying to prevent.

You mean, raising the city?

But what could they possibly
be afraid of?

The Mandarin.
But he's nothing but dust now.

Many do not see death as
the final step in one's existence.

And a prophecy foretells his return.

So, because I lifted the ruins, people
think the prophecy's coming true?

It is as written:

"The city will rise and
the demon Elementals will awaken.

They will gather the bands
of the underworld...

and with them,
resurrect their master."

That 's just crazy.
Lf that is what you believe...

there is no point in saying more.

I'm sorry. It 's just hard for me
to swallow.

Tell me, what are these
"bands of the underworld"?

Five were fashioned for the Mandarin
as conduits to the afterlife.

Upon his death...

four were stolen by monks, who
sacrificed their lives to hide them.

They were the first
Jade Dragons.

These are the locations
of those bands.

So, once these things are found...

the Mandarin is supposed
to come back to life?

Yes. His demon Elementals
have already begun to gather them.

Stop the Elementals, and you
prevent the Mandarin from rising.

Me? But I...

Stand up!

Do you want to live?

If I have a choice, yes.

Then, you will reverse what you
have done to the ancient city!

Look, the Fiber Steel that 's holding
it up is pretty much indestructible.

You'll find a way. We'll provide you
with your own technology.

What if I can't do it?

You owe your life to this man.

See how your unwillingness
repays him.

Please, just stop!

I'll help you.

You have one week, or he dies.

What are we gonna do now?
We get to work.

Hi.

Thank you.

What will that device do?

It 's a macrobiotic nullifier.

If it works, it 'll soften the
Fiber Steel under the ruins.

Will you finish it in time?
Hope so.

I will let you get back to work.

Li Mei!

You don't belong with
these murderers.

Why are you doing this?
The Mandarin will rise...

and many will die in the East
and in the West.

Their souls will be offered
as payment...

Okay, that 's the company line.
Now, what about you?

I have a responsibility.

It has been passed from father to son
ever since the Mandarin Dynasty.

Father to son... but...
I had no brothers.

And your father?

He...

...is dead.
I take it he wanted a son.

No.

He needed a son,
but instead he got me.

You would not understand.
Maybe I would.

You're not the only one who's faced
a father's disappointment.

Tony, do you know why
you are on this earth?

Does anyone?
Yes... I do.

I have always known.

So, this is the life you wanna live?
My life does not matter.

This thing's amazing!

Where did you get this idea?
Just something I came up with.

Tony!
What 's going on?

Wong Chu is coming.
You must escape.

Get back.

Demonstrate your device. Now!
Hey. No problem. Allow me.

Okay, sample is in place.
Let 's see.

Activating thermal
scan constrictors.

Setting atomic nine iron...

to 35O, and... adjusting
for permanent settings.

And...

Your deception will cost you your life!

This way!

Mr. Chu!

Li Mei, it 's okay.
It 's me, Tony.

Go. Leave.
Not without you.

Just get out of here. And promise me...
you'll never come back.

I won't leave you here.
Goodbye, Tony.

Come on, man! We gotta go!

Climb on.

Stuffy!

That 's the last time
I ever wanna put this thing on.

What should we do with him?

Why are you asking me?
You are now the senior member.

I do not care.

He is the one.
No, it is not him.

Li Mei, look at it!
It is undeniable!

The prophecy continues
to unfold.

He's the Iron Knight! He's destined
to battle the risen Mandarin!

It cannot be him!

What is the matter?
It is a good thing.

The Mandarin can
now be defeated.

We do not know who will be
victorious, only that one will die.

Stark Air 601,you are cleared for
landing. Proceed to runway three.

Hands in the air!

What 's going on here?

I'm SHIELD Agent Drake,
and I'm placing you under arrest.

For what?
Arms dealing!

Chinese government is charging you
with selling weapons to radicals...

...the Jade Dragons.
You guys got this all wrong.

Listen to me, the Jade Dragons
only have Stark weaponry...

because they stole it
from our cargo jet.

We've received documents
linking you to the sale.

What documents?
There was no sale.

Cease-fire! Cease-fire!

He knows it 's bullet proof,
because he built it for us!

What are you doing?
We must hurry!

What of the fifth Elemental?

If we destroy the temple,
the Dragon will fall.

Fine. I will go in first.

It is safe.
Now move, quickly!

Okay, that is far enough.
Set up here.

Forgive me.

Why is this happening to us?

I don't know. But we're cut off
from our offices.

Damn!

Hey.

Those locations are...

Ho Yin drew them on this map!

You think the old man was right?

Something's going on,
and I want some answers!

Where you going?
After the third ring.

I beg your pardon!

Hello. Oh, hi, Mum.
Mum?

Yes, I'm fine.
Busy, busy, busy.

Lots of company.

What have you gotten
yourself into?

I'll explain later, Pepper.
Right now, I need into my office.

That 's gonna be a bit difficult, since I
have SHIELD agents crawling up my...

Pepper, I know.
Can you arrange it?

You know the east stairwell door
that leads to the outside?

I'll make sure it's unlocked.

Hello? Tony!
I can hardly hear you!

How did you two sneak
into the lobby?

You have to get out there
before the agents...

Tony! Tony!

Oh darn!
Suspects are in the lobby! I repeat.

Suspects are in the lobby!

Remind me to move my office
to the first floor.

So, I want assets from these three
offshore accounts made available...

and keep it on the down low.

What, we came here
so you can do business?

Not exactly.

Access code: Maria.

Access granted.

What the?

Greetings, Mr. Stark.

Since when do you
have a secret room?

Come on, Rhodey.

Pepper, I owe you one.

And I'm keeping track.

Lights.

Interactive exo-suits.

With these things,
one person can accomplish...

what it normally would take dozens.

Exploration of any hostile
environments...

deep sea, volcanoes,
space, anything.

These armors will change the world.

And since the next place on the map
is on the floor of the Atlantic...

the aquatic model is going
to get me there.

Something wrong?
Just something you came up with?

I know. Sorry.

But I just wanted to keep it
top-secret.

Top-secret?

Yeah. You're full of it, Tony.
Rhodey.

This is what you hired me for,
isn't it?

To work with you
in development?

I was going to bring you in
when the time was right.

When the time was...

Why don't you just own up to it,
Tony?

You didn't trust me enough
to be a part of this project!

I mean, I'm your closest friend!
I've always been in your corner!

Come on, Rhodey, you're making
this personal. We're friends.

Why are you overreacting?

I'm the only one who
sees it for what it is!

Remember when your father
took your stuff...

and put it into his weapon's program?

How betrayed you felt?
Well, guess what, Tony?

You're just like him!

You know what? You're right.
We've got a lot to talk about.

But right now, I need your help.

This must be the place.

Spectrum analysis:
Unknown energy source detected.

Sweet dreams.

Warning. Warning.
Suit integrity compromised.

Warning. Armor breach.

Life support failing.

Looks like it didn't go so well.
It 's real, Rhodey. All of this.

What I fought today I can't even
begin to explain, but it is real!

What have I done?
It 's not your fault.

Release armor!

Rhodey, I raised that ancient city!
I set this in motion! It is my fault!

And true to form, my father
has made everything worse!

You're not gonna do
something stupid, are you?

Absolutely.

You sold me out!
I did no such thing!

You needed a guy for
the Chinese government...

so you trumped up
a phony arms deal!

Underhanded ethics
are your domain, not mine.

Don't talk to me about ethics.

You loaded weapons onto the jet
for Rhodey knowing I was against it!

They got stolen
and people died.

Now they're blaming me for those!
Rhodey needed protection!

You left him out there
with nothing!

They attacked us with
our own guns, Dad!

I wouldn't be on the run
if you'd just stayed out of it!

Why don't you drop
this pacifist bull?!

Military contracts are
what built this company!

No, it started the company.
I built it and without a single weapon!

Listen to you!
You sound just like...

Go on! Like my mother?

She hated the work I did, and she
got you believing that weapons...

How dare you blame her
for any of this?!

She stood by you, Dad!
She defended you!

When are you gonna stop blaming me
for her death? I lost her, too.

Yeah, but I lost you both!

Pepper.
Hi, Tony. Tony!

Clumsy me.

You're aiding and abetting
a fugitive, Miss Potts!

I don't know how you're helping him,
but you are.

And that 's enough
to take you into custody.

Fine. I could use the rest.

I've pulled data on the
fourth ring's location.

It looks like it 's right in the center
of an active volcano.

We've got bigger problems. They're
on to us and Pepper's been arrested.

Slipping past them is definitely
gonna be a problem.

Then I'll lure them away.
What?

No, Rhodey. They'll arrest you!
Look...

I'm open to other options,
but face it...

we're trapped in here and
you gotta get to Central America.

Rhodey, thanks.

Hey, it 's what friends do.

Hey, Jake and Elwood!

We got him on the roof!

I'll take that.

Okay, fellas, take it easy.

Just... stay down!

Lose something, Rockslide?

Tony.

Li Mei!

What are you doing here?
I did not know where else to go.

I tried your building, but...

Yeah, it 's complicated. Listen,
I went after the Mandarin's rings.

I know. Why would you do that?

I had to.
Did you get them?

Just one.
And what of the Elementals?

Only the Earth-Mover's left.

Then you're not safe! He will seek out
that ring wherever it is!

Please, give it to me!
It is my responsibility!

There's no way I'm letting
that thing come after you!

Tony, it is not your burden.

There must be another way.
No, there is not.

What about the tomb?
What if I destroy it? Will it end?

Li Mei, tell me!
I don't know.

Then it 's worth a try.
But I'm gonna need some armor.

Hello?
Is this line secure?

Tony. Son, yes, of course it is!
Are you okay? I've been so worried.

Dad...

...what 's going on?
Nothing.

Everything's fine, really.
Tell me, what do you need?

They've got Pepper and Rhodey.
Can you get me into the building?

Absolutely, Tony.
I'll clear the way.

Just come on up, okay?
I'll take care of everything.

I love you, son.

They were listening.
He was warning me away.

I don't know what else to do.

Unless...

Come on!

I have had enough of you!

Here, take these.
I'm going after the temple.

Maybe the fifth ring is
still in the tomb with him.

It isn't.

It 's here.

Your bracelet?
You must go. Please.

Li Mei, what is going on?

I begged you not to come!
I've done everything I could...

...to keep you away!
What?

I gave the government those
documents, so they'd arrest you.

Why?
To save your life!

I told you, I have a responsibility.

I know, to stop the Mandarin.
Not to stop him!

To ensure his resurrection.

What are you saying?

You mean, joining the Jade Dragons,
the things you said to me...

I am the last descendant
of the Mandarin. It falls to me.

I must be his vessel,
so he may walk the earth again.

Li Mei, listen,
you don't have to do this.

"This"! It 's the only reason
I even exist!

The very purpose of my life!

Please go. While you still can.

I'm not going anywhere.

Then you will die.

Li Mei!

Li Mei, where are you?

Li Mei...

Li Mei, are you all right?
What happened?

Don't touch me!

She has served her purpose,
Iron Knight.

As for you, your blood
must now be shed...

and the prophecy
will be fulfilled.

Li Mei! I know you're in there!

Please! Don't do this!

Listen to me!
Remember who you are!

You are Li Mei!

You are Li Mei!

Kill him!

Kill him!

Get away from him!

Li Mei.

Tony?
I'm right here.

You...

saved me.

You saved me, too.

Tony! Thank you for coming in.

I apologize for being late.
I'd to finish my interview with SHIELD.

We're happy to hear the Chinese
government cleared all charges.

Tony, let me get right to the point.

We've just learned over that last week,
someone has been buying up stock.

So much stock that this board
no longer has controlling interest.

And you suspect that
I'm that "someone".

Well... yes.

You're correct.
Stark Enterprises is mine.

I would just like to remind you that,
as a board of directors...

we have always, always, had the
company's best interest at heart.

Now, sometimes we may have acted...
I have two orders of business.

One.

I'm promoting James Rhodes to Chief
Engineer for Advanced Technologies.

Thanks, man.
You've earned it.

And two, I'm handing control
of the company over to my father.

What?
It 's yours, Dad.

The future of the company
is now yours to decide.

You know, I've always seen this
as a father-son enterprise.

Wonderful news, Tony, Howard.
We'll support you both 11O percent.

Shut up, Boyer!

My first order of business.

You're all fired!
