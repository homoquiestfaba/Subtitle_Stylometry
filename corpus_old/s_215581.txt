So gather around
as I run it down...

and unraveI my pedigree.

My father...

was a junkie.

Don't you never do this shit,
you hear me?

This is bad shit.

Yeah, OK.

Don't you never be Iike me,
aII right?

Don't do it.

What you want for Christmas?

I don't know.

You don't know?

Boy, you better know
what you want.

EIse, how do you expect
to get what you want...

if you don't know what you want?

-I'II be right back.
-Daddy, don't go!

No, man, don't.

Come on, I'm sorry, boy.

You know
you're my main IittIe nigger.

You go--you go...

Get out of here, man.

Give to the poor.

Let's go, come on.

Hey!
Merry God damn Christmas, kid!

You been a good boy, huh?

Murderer!

Don't teach my boy
that fairy taIe eIf shit!

Did you see?

I'm sorry.

The money.

My father,
when I saw him die Iike that--

saw him find his grave
in the snow--

I onIy had one thought.

It wasn't going to happen to me.

TeII me,
do you know the difference...

between a bIack man
and a nigger?

Most niggers don't.

Next, pIease.

Good morning. Have a seat.

So teII me, Officer Winston...

what's the difference...

between a bIack man
and a nigger?

Who the fuck do you think
you're taIking to?

Right. Thanks for coming in.

So, Officer Stevens...

teII me, do you know
the difference...

between a bIack man
and a nigger?

The nigger's the one that wouId
even answer that question.

Most undercover cops
don't know what they're doing...

because it's a day gig.

I'm Iooking for somebody
who wiII go under...

and stay under--

six months, a year, five years.

What does he have to do?

Buy drugs, seII drugs...

set up the peopIe
that I want to bust.

No. He's a snitch.

He's a drug deaIer.

He's a criminaI, he's a scumbag.

But most importantIy...

he's a scumbag
for the right side.

You'II be on Ioan to the DEA...

and you'II report
directIy to me.

I've stayed away from this
kind of stuff aII my Iife...

drugs and stuff.

I've never even had a drink.
I never have, and I never wiII.

Because your father was
kiIIed robbing a Iiquor store...

when you were ten years oId?

I'm God. I know everything.

Why did you join the force?

Because I wanted to be
of some use...

to make a difference somehow.

Have you ever seen
your psychoIogicaI profiIe?

You score aImost exactIy
Iike a criminaI.

Look at this.
''Resents authority.

''Rigid moraI code...

''but with no underIying
system of vaIues.

''InsufficientIy deveIoped
sense of seIf.''

Look at aII the rage...

Iook at aII
the repressed vioIence.

I'm teIIing you, undercover...

aII your fauIts
wiII become virtues.

You'II be a star there, John.

You'II do a Iot more good
there than in uniform.

You wiII be of use.

You wiII make a difference.

Those guys...

after work, they went home
to their wife and kids.

Then one day on the street,
they forgot where they were...

and now they're dead.

But you'II never go home...

so you won't forget.

Because there's onIy one ruIe
in this game, John--

don't bIow your cover.

I didn't want the assignment.

I sat there
the whoIe interview...

thinking that if I took it...

it wouId be the biggest mistake
of my Iife.

And I was right.

I'm Iooking for a room.

So you see?
That's what's wrong--

there's just
no imagination these days.

Hey, bassino!

That's BeIinda Chacon...

and if you want my opinion...

you'II stay away
from that bitch.

If you want to get anywhere
in drug enforcement...

don't bother
with street deaIers.

You take one of them out...

there's ten more
to take their pIace.

Go after the big guys...

try to knock out
the big networks.

FeIix Barbosa.

He's Iike
a middIe-IeveI executive.

He suppIies the guys
who suppIy the guys...

who suppIy the street.

He gets his stuff
from the importer...

Anton GaIIegos.

GaIIegos is the number one
importer in the West Coast.

Forty percent of aII the drugs
in Los AngeIes...

go directIy through this guy.

Very cute.

He's abIe to do this
IargeIy because his uncIe...

Hector Guzman...

is an infIuentiaI
Latin-American poIitician...

a seIf-promoting
dupIicitous greasebaII...

according to our friends
at the State Department.

He heIps GaIIegos get
the product into the country.

Are we going after him?

Uh, weII...

no, not directIy. He's too big.

But if we can naiI the nephew...

maybe it'II smear the uncIe,
hurt him back home poIiticaIIy.

That wouId be very good
for you and me.

That wouId get us friends
in high pIaces.

But we want the uncIe.
We want Guzman.

John, Iisten.
WiII you stay with me?

One step at a time.

You go for Barbosa...

and then GaIIegos...

nice and orderIy.

The beauty of that
is it protects your ass.

HoIIywood...

The great thing
about Iife on the street...

is you know
how it's going to be.

It's aIways the same.

It's aIways getting worse.

Eddie, in his red caddy
and his nice cIothes...

that his mama
must have bought him...

he suppIied the street deaIers.

He was a crazy, good-natured,
desperate asshoIe...

with a Iife expectancy
of about a haIf an hour.

But peopIe said he got his dope
by way of FeIix Barbosa...

so I had to get to him
and through him...

whiIe he was stiII around.

Yo, baby boy.

What the fuck I teII you
about being around here?

They toId me I had to.

No, that's sad, sad,
but too fucking Iate.

Hasta Ia vista...

motherfucker!

That's coId shit, man.

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

He done done, ain't he?

Fuck it.

So this young Iady
is on triaI for prostitution.

The judge says,
''You're very attractive.

''You Iook Iike
you might have Indian heritage.

''Are you a Navaho?''

She said, ''No, your honor.

''I'm a Chicago ho.''

WouId you get us some beers,
Eddie?

AII right.

''I'm a Chicago ho.''

I hung around
the obvious pIaces for awhiIe...

then one day Eddie waIked up
to me and started taIking...

just Iike I knew he wouId.

I wiII have two beers...

and a white wine
for the tremendous behind.

How you doing, brother?

Remember?

Yes, I remember.

I once knew
a brother named John...

who Ioved to dance
when he got it on.

He made the pussy
do the watusi...

and she said, ''Ooh, God damn,
this rhythm is strong.''

Stay bIack.

What's that nigger
taIking about, ''Stay bIack''?

He shouId stay off that crack.

Eddie?

He's a space case.

I don't know. He, uh...

buys from this man...

David Jason...

who, uh...

apparentIy is suppIied
by the Latins.

Good.

I saw this kid...

kiIIed the other day.

he couIdn't have been more
than 12, 13 years oId.

Shot him in the back.

I want you to buy from Jason
and then get to the Latins.

You don't want to rush
this thing.

Rush it, pIease.

What do you need?

I'm Iooking for Eddie.

It's OK.

TeII him to get that door.

What's up, man?

What brings you to my office?

Just say no.

I need a bird, man.

You want to straighten up
and fIy right.

Stratosphere, baby.

What the fuck you doing?

Shit, stop sIurping.
This ain't no 7-11.

Bitch, you fucking up!

I'II send your ass
back to Reseda.

Can you come up with that 1-8
straight mañana?

Yeah. I'II have the money.

You need to take this girI
off the fire, man.

She's done.

Why you gonna dis
my Nubian queen Iike that?

Mañana.

You got a right
to remain siIent, Eddie.

You got a right to an attorney.

As you might have expected...

it didn't take Eddie Iong
to get himseIf in a jam.

After hoIding out
for two or three seconds...

he started offering the cops
anybody he couId think of.

The first person
he couId think of was me.

It turned out to be
just the break I needed.

Three times four?

Seven.

No, no. You're adding again.

Three pIus four--

Honey, she's aIready done this.

Honey, she wiII get it.

Three times four?

TweIve.

Right! That's right.

See? We worked on this aIready.

ExceIIent.

Uh, three times five?

Honey, can you get that?

Eight.

Daddy, why can't I just use
a caIcuIator?

Honey, you can't Iearn
with a caIcuIator, OK?

What are you doing here?

We got a probIem, David.

CaII me on the phone.
I don't Iike--

Your friend Eddie
just got busted.

He's bending over
for the cops...

trying to save his ass.

And he'II Iose
that skinny IittIe thing.

Did he name us?

Not yet,
but he wiII if he has to...

and eventuaIIy he'II have to.

Daddy, heIp me with my homework!

I don't think
he'd taIk about us.

If we whack him,
he definiteIy won't.

Don't worry, David.
I'II take care of him.

Daddy!

Just a second.

FeIix, if there's a probIem,
we'II kiII him.

I'II kiII him myseIf.

Nancy, get out of here!

For you. It's Eddie.

I'm FeIix Barbosa.

Thank you, sweetie.

Thank you very much.

You've got a beautifuI wife,
David.

No wonder he doesn't
invite us over, eh?

Don't--
If you come to my house...

pIease show a IittIe respect.

He can't heIp it, David.

It's his nature.

Uh, I know how to handIe this.

He'II get you busted.

No, he won't.
Eddie, my man.

AII right.

So, you wanted to meet me?

I Iike to know
the important customers.

We've met. Now what?

You're taking a Iot away
for a guy we hardIy know.

Where are you moving this stuff?

Do Macy's teII GimbeI's,

Forget it, Eddie.
This guy's a cop.

What?

Eddie,
what the fuck is this, man?

You know me.

I done gave you
a Iot of paper, man.

-I thought you were serious.
-I'm very serious.

You're serious?

Look, fucking caII me
when you get serious.

I wiII caII you.
Let me just taIk to him.

KiII it. You cooI?

No. Get down.

I'II taIk to him.

Is that our bust?

WeII, who is he?

Some scumbag.

The guy is not a cop.

Come on, David.
Did you see it in his eyes?

Don't fuck with me.

Eighteen thousand, David.
We need it. We're behind.

You know that.

Fucking animaI!

Fuck!

Make sure he gets it aII.

Mr. HuII, hey, how you doin'?

AII right. How you doin'?
Hey, James.

Say hi to Mr. HuII.

I was to the weIfare today...

and I got on
the wrong fucking bus, and...

by the time I got there...

they changed the time on me,
and shit...

They're supposed
to give me notification.

So I'm off the weIfare.

Hey. How you doin'?

You aII right?

What did you eat today?

I had ding dongs.

You had ding dongs.

Yeah, he had ding dongs.

You go across the street

Get yourseIf

or something Iike that...

and get you some miIk, OK?

-I don't Iike miIk.
-Get some anyway.

-Don't taIk back to Mr. HuII.
-Yes, sir.

He's a good boy.

-Go on.
-Yes, sir.

You be carefuI
crossing that street, James.

You know, BeIinda, uh...

it ain't none of my business,
but you got a reaIIy nice kid.

You ought to take
better care of him.

Don't fucking teII me how to
take care of my fucking kid!

I take damn good care of my kid!

My kid is cIean!

Look, I'm cIean, too, right?

I've been tested.
I'm HIV-negative.

Just so you know.

I'm just Iaying that
out there, but, um...

it's very hard raising a kid,
Mr. HuII...

so you know that.

It's not an easy fucking thing,
aII right?

You dig what I'm saying?

I know you Iike my kid, right?

I couId teII you Iikes him,
right?

So, Iisten...

I thought of something.
Maybe you Iike this.

He needs a maIe roIe modeI,
right?

Maybe you wouId Iike
to take care of him.

You couId have him
for three thousand doIIars.

AII right, aII r--

Two thousand doIIars.

But that's it, man.
Two thousand doIIars.

What the fuck is that?
That's too much for my onIy son?

I know
you're a rich motherfucker.

Wait a fucking minute!

AII right.
Hey, I ain't on your shit.

Go for your phone caII, man.

Where you at, Eddie?

Yeah, I'II be there in a few.

Yeah, aII right.

So what do you say, man?

Yo, Mr. HuII!

I ain't got fucking time

Wait, wait, Mr. HuII!

Hey, my man.

I'm going to get you, Eddie!

Right there, scumbag!

Put your fucking hands

Come on, nice and easy.
Turn around, baby.

Hands in the air.

How you doing, Judas?

Give me a name!

Why you keep asking me?

For the Iast time,
I'm teIIing you.

For the Iast fucking time...

I don't know the guy!

I don't know nothing!

Bobby, give me a minute.

Are you a Christian?

Oh, shit. Yeah, man.

In God we trust, right?

WeII, I'm a Christian.

When a Christian
does something wrong...

he or she has to make amends.

At the arrest tonight...

I was wrong in hitting you.

Yeah, you was wrong.

I apoIogize. You have a right
to fiIe a compIaint.

-That's aII right.
-I'd fiIe it if I were you.

No. That's aII right.

You're a new face around here.

I haven't seen you
on the street before.

Where you from?

From OakIand, man.

Nah. You're not from OakIand.

I know OakIand.

You're from back east--

Jersey, New York, D.C.

Maybe.

Let me ask you something--

you got kids?

WeII, these...

are my African-American
beautifuI babies.

If somebody put a gun
to your baby's head...

wouId you try and kiII them
if you couId?

Me, too.

And by seIIing that stuff...

you're putting a gun
to my baby's head.

Let me warn you.

I'm Iike a mad dog after a bone.

I'd be aII over you
Iike stink on doo-doo.

Trust me.

Here.

You read this.

It gives me a Iot of pIeasure.

A prayer book.

Check this out, reverend.

God bIess you.

Sit.

What are you doing here?

I work here.

You work here as what?

David Jason, Attorney at Law.

AII rise.

The court is now in session.

The honorabIe
Judge H. Aracott presiding.

-Want a chicIet?
-Be seated.

You're a Iawyer?

Yeah. I'm your Iawyer.

Who hired you?

I'm handIing it pro bono.

If you don't want me,
there's the P.D.

And she's good. She's just can't
provide speciaI services.

Like what?

''PeopIe vs. John HuII.''

Getting your case caIIed first.

How do you pIead?

Um, your honor,

If I may approach you?

Your honor, uh...

this is the preIiminary
poIice toxicoIogy report...

which says that the substance
seized from my cIient...

was MannitoI, a baby Iaxative.

I've spoken with the prosecutor.

She agrees
to an immediate dismissaI.

Miss Ryan?

Dismissed.

Audi 5000.

You're a saint.

Is he here?

Yeah. Him and Eddie.

You soId me MannitoI.

If I hadn't,
you'd be in jaiI right now.

Don't worry.
You'II get what you paid for.

PoIice heIicopter
shined the Iight on us.

He said, ''Shit.
The poIice done you a favor.''

You been eating grass
for the Iast haIf hour.

My man.

Were you surprised to see him?

SaIaam aIeichem, brother.

Listen, John here got busted...

but he kept his mouth shut.

Now, uh, everybody here
can't say that, right?

FinaIIy, FeIix Barbosa...

the first stop
on Carver's pyramid.

I was right where
I was supposed to be.

That reaIIy depends
on what you're saying, David.

Are you saying something
about me?

Come on, Eddie.

TeII the truth. Be honorabIe.

That's aII you got Ieft.

Fuck you, IittIe faggot.

Ain't had pussy
since pussy had you.

Cops made you
give them somebody.

Yeah. OK. AII right. CooI.

I gave somebody up.

AII I gave up
was this IittIe motherfucker.

You got the money.
Eighteen grand.

Count the shit, David.

There it is on the tabIe.

Next time you might give up us.

Now, wait a minute.
Wait a fucking minute.

Never, FeIix. I swear to God.
I wouId never--

I know you never wiII.

Why y'aII gonna do me Iike that?
Shit.

I'm worth money to you.

I couId give you money.

Why, Eddie?
You don't owe me anything.

Just to teII you that I'm cooI.

I couId hook you up
with another 18 or 2-4.

I couId go with an extra two.

You know,
just for the wiIdIife fund.

I couId go with 5-0.

Why not one hundred?

One hundred?

CooI. One hundred.

Give it.

Twenty four hours, man.
Tomorrow.

Now.

Ten seconds.

One.

I don't have it.

Five.

Why you treating me

Six.

You want to do it, David?

Come on. You know me.

What am I doing? Oh, God!

-Motherfucker!
-Let him go! Let him go!

I'm sorry. Oh, God.

Jesus fucking Christ, man!

It was a fucking joke, Eddie.

Eddie, pIease go home, huh?

ApoIogize to these guys
and go home.

Fuck. AII right.

Gopher, Gopher, I'm very sorry.

Listen, man, I didn't mean
to caII you a homosexuaI.

And you know I'm a businessman.

I go to work.

-Hey, brother--
-Go home, man.

Eddie, I just want
to ask you a question.

You reaIIy fucking think
you'd get away with this shit?

You work for me, Eddie...

Iearn to keep
your fucking mouth shut!

Understand? If you can't fucking
do it, I'II do it for you!

I'm sorry.

I'II fucking do it for you
permanentIy.

Come here.

I'm sorry!

Come here, you...

Fuck it.

Come on, you guys.

Take a Iook at this, huh?

So, Johnny...

what do you think?

I think you made your point.

Hey, I Iike him.

That's very good.

What about you, bar mitzvah boy?

First time you see somebody die?

Uh, I was fourteen, and uh...

I was in camp, and, uh...

a friend of mine
was water-skiing, and...

a junior counseIor
was driving the boat, and...

the motorboat ran him over.

You ought to kiII a man someday,
David.

It's...

Iiberating.

Coke is dead. So what's next?

Oh, you're so smart.

WeII, that's the question...

but that's for me to know
and you to find out.

Why aren't you seIIing it, then?

'Cause, uh...
I can make it chemicaIIy.

I know how to market it.

I need a chunk of money...

and that's why I'm hanging
around with this Barbosa.

-I can't get the big guys.
-Who are the big guys?

Why can't you get next to them?

I don't move enough quantity.

Why do you ask
so many questions?

'Cause I'm a cop.

That's funny.
Hey, I toId you that.

You know anything
about designer drugs?

What, ice and ecstasy and tar?

Yeah, yeah. You know,
they've gotten a bad name...

'cause there's a Iimited market
for Parkinson's disease...

but what about a substance...

that was absoIuteIy safe
and currentIy IegaI...

that you couId go to work on...

and do your job better...

than you ever did it straight?

Right. Sounds Iike a dream.

In dreams
begin responsibiIities.

So what is this new thing,
this thing you can make--

Oh, some other time, John,
when we know each other better.

Let's see what we have.

This is more than I bought.

Yeah. WeII, haIf we owe you.
The other haIf's on consignment.

It's a token of our esteem
'cause you kept your mouth shut.

You having troubIe moving it...

especiaIIy
since you got no more Eddie.

You got me.

That's true.

Make me your partner,
I'II get your money.

I need a saIesman,
not a partner.

You need a partner...

'cause FeIix Barbosa won't back
you and your wonder drug...

whatever it is.

One.

Two.

I can't buy that much shit.
I don't have that in the budget.

What am I supposed to do
with it?

You're a drug deaIer.

DeaI drugs.

Hey, man. Me first!

I was supposed to be
making a difference.

Here I was seIIing drugs to kids
and pregnant women.

I hating doing
what I was doing...

but I was good at it.

Being a cop was never this easy.

Peace.

Listen, if you working for me,
you either use or you seII.

You can't do both.

How am I supposed to use
if I got four kids?

Fine young thing Iike you?
What you doing with four kids?

I'II give you fine young thing,
baby.

Bitch, I toId you--

Another fucking nigger's car--

I don't want to have
to see you here!

Get your hands off me, buddy!

AII right. It's cooI.

Hey, it's cooI, baby.

Listen up, sissy.
This pIace ain't yours no more.

It's ours.

So take your
weaseI-Iooking ass...

and this scrawny bitch
the fuck out of here.

Send that nigger home!

Yeah. I'II be back.
You see that movie, man?

Rent it
at your IocaI video store.

Let's roII, baby.

David, there's someone here
to see you.

So what's your name?

John. You?

JacquiIine with a ''J.''

-I got to go.
-No, wait. Come back.

Same time, same station.

-Don't Iet it get coId.
-AII right.

David, we got to go, man.

How come I Iike baIIing
bIack chicks so much?

Maybe you feeI
Iike you fucking a sIave.

-Like a bondage thing?
-No. Like a racist thing.

You ever been
with two women at once?

Yeah.
Your mother and your father.

Yeah? Did my mama
get buck wiId on you?

OK, Mack Daddy...

you're about to meet
somebody very--

You'II thank me for this.

She's a truffIe. Lock the door.

Ooh, baby! Baby.

David, you're Iate.

So beige.
You're a vision in beige.

This is Betty. Isn't she...

a stone fox?

John HuII, my new associate.

Your new Eddie.

I hear the oId one wore out.

Factory recaII.

This is the advanced modeI.

That's $50,000, thanks to John,
empIoyee of the week.

So how does this work?

Dig--dig this.

Betty sends this money...

to an unnamed African nation...

to a store
for stuff she never bought.

They deposit it
in a bank down there...

who then, in turn...

makes a Ioan to Betty
which she never has to repay.

That way it doesn't show up
as income for the IRS.

It's the Iaundress' math.

You taIk too much.

Why? John is--
John is the cooIest, baby.

I'm the cooIest.

How much is this?

Do you know anything
about ethnic art?

Have you ever been
in a store Iike this?

See, we don't put price tags
on our merchandise.

So if you have to ask...

then obviousIy
you can't afford it.

In that case,
I'II take two of them.

You're up...

Eddie II.

Not for me. Thank you.

Why not?

Because it can get to be
a very expensive habit...

and as you said,
I can't afford it.

You know something?

I don't trust you.

You know something?

I don't think
you couId trust yourseIf.

And you know something eIse?

A man has two things
in this worId--

his word and his baIIs...

or is that three things?

Lighten up, Betty.

What's the vibe here?

You shouId have seen
this guy on the street.

You were so...

Iike some beautifuI panther...

or--or--or jungIe storm.

This is not
my condescending infatuation...

with just everything bIack.

Those poIiticaIIy conservative
Negroes can kiss my ass...

and these anti-Semitic pricks
can kiss my ass...

but you have the gift of fury.

You're Iike a--a dangerous...

magnificent beast.

Watch your mouth, David.

Watch my mouth?

I can say anything I want.

-You can say anything you want?
-You didn't hear me?

I can say anything
I fucking want to say!

Boys.

Is this some type
of maIe bonding thing?

Because you can take it outside.

You're bIowing my high.

She wants us bad.
She wants us both.

Mmm ! But we got to go.

I want two of those masks.

Two of them.

-You can't take shit off nobody.
-Man, I--

I don't care how big they are.

I ain't afraid of no nigger.

I'm back!

WiId, wiId west!

WiId, wiId west, motherfuckers!

Motherfucker!

We got to kiII him.

'Cause, Iook,
she worked for you.

You were supposed
to protect her.

If you don't assert now...

you're going to Iose authority
with the other deaIers...

and one of them's
going to kiII you.

PIus with Ivy out the way,
we can take over his territory.

Thank you.

AII right. We'II get
Barbosa's man Chino to do it.

No. If we use Chino, then
it's Barbosa who's asserting.

It'II be Barbosa's territory.
It's got to be us, baby.

If it's us, it's got to be me,
right?

If I do this, we partners, man.

Fifty-fifty.
Everything down the middIe.

I want to see you come back
in one piece.

Me, too.

Come on, I see you jam.

Sinkin' into that format fIow

Get doIIars, hit the door

And I'm at the core
Iike rhythm and bIues

I pay dues Iike taxes

So I Iike to match
a negative emcee

Against smoke Iike a primo

Send home,
win a IittIe butt-naked demo

We came with

How you gonna pIay the game?
With compromise? No, sir

WhiIe some change
for a IittIe chump change

And more air pIay

And they compIain
when they don't hear

A IittIe tape in the back
of a caddy or a jeep

He shouIda stayed
with the street

-Come on
-Ow

I see you jam, come on

Yo, this is ragtime,
and right about now...

I'm out of time...

but the deejay's going keep
the party bumping...

with funky rhythms,
know what I'm saying?

Peace!

I knew you'd come.

ShouId have popped me
when my back was turned, bitch.

What the fuck you Iooking at?

Ah, you a bitch.

You want to suck it, bitch...

or you want a drink?

You in a coma, motherfucker?

You fucking bitch.

You did it...

partner.

You see?

I had kiIIed a man...

a man who Iooked Iike me...

whose mother and father...

Iooked Iike my mother
and father...

and nothing happened.

And the poIice
didn't come after me.

No one did.

I couId have kiIIed others
if I'd wanted to...

and gotten away with it.

This is cocaine...

an addictive aIkaIoid...

which distorts
the thought processes...

destroys the sex drive...

and makes most peopIe
too obnoxious to bear.

It's iIIegaI,
and as you know...

you can buy it
on any street corner.

This is a chemicaI variant.

It increases attention, energy,
cognitive powers...

yet with a smooth...

opiate-Iike emotionaI surface.

It's compIeteIy IegaI...

and I'm the onIy one who knows
how to make it.

How much can you make it for?

Give me five miIIion doIIars...

and I'II suppIy
the whoIe West Coast...

for thirty cents a pop.

The worId wiII cost more.

So aII we need is the...

Money.

And we're out of business
with these morons forever.

I want you to get
a new apartment.

Something expensive.

What's wrong with where I'm at?

That dump?

Come on.
You're a big deaIer now.

Act Iike it. Spend some money.
Get new cIothes. Have some fun.

That's an order.

So what was it Iike?

What was what Iike?

Popping Ivy.

I'm God, remember?

Then you shouId know
what it was Iike.

We've taken over
Ivy's territory.

We're moving more product.

That means GaIIegos wiII
probabIy come to us himseIf.

Great. If we can take him down
by the end of the month...

it'II go on
this quarter's report.

The faggots in congress
wiII Iove that.

Make us Iook efficient.

What's the probIem?

You ever kiII anybody?

Are you kidding?

I went to Princeton
to avoid aII that shit.

What am I doing here, man?

Have you ever seen a crack baby?

Newborn crack baby...

six hours oId...

screaming its heart out...

because it's going
through withdrawaI?

Over the course
of the next year...

it doesn't Iearn to crawI
or waIk...

or taIk on time...

because it's got deformities.

PhysicaI deformities...

mentaI deformities.

It's got brain damage...

Iowered IQ...

dysIexia--
God onIy knows what eIse.

Maybe it goes to schooI...

but it can't Iearn.

And it's vioIent...

so it gets in troubIe
with the Iaw.

It's unabIe to form
any cIose emotionaI ties...
