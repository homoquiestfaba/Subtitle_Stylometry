<i>[Fly buzzes]</i>

<i>(Jack)
Where is he?</i>

<i>(Jack)</i>
<i>He's a French dealer selling</i>
<i>a case of liquid heroin.</i>

<i>Ben, grab the drugs.
Bobby's at the money.</i>

<i>Me and Marshall</i>
<i>will cover you till</i>
<i>you get back to the car.</i>

<i>Then we get the fuck out.</i>

So my plan, basically.

You came to me,
remember?

<i>That's him.</i>

<i>[Gun cocked]</i>

<i>[Muffled yelling]</i>

<i>[Gunshot]</i>


<i>[Gunshot]</i>

Bobby.

Sorry, mate.

<i>[Tires screeching]</i>

<i>(Jack)
Bobby.</i>

Bobby.

Fuck.

Bobby.

<i>(Marshall)</i>
<i>Jack.</i>
Bobby.

<i>Bobby is gone, Jack.
We need to leave now.</i>

<i>Come on.
Come on, now.</i>

Hi.

Hi, sweetie pie.

<i>How's my beautiful godson?</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

Come here.

Hi, sweet pie.

I missed you.

You're late.
Now I'm going
to be late.

<i>Nice to see you, too.</i>

Someone has been crying
his little head off
all morning.

The bloody
washing machine's broken.

I'm having to wash
everything in the sink.

Speaking of which...
<i>don't push</i>
<i>your luck, mommy.</i>

Godmothers babysit,
we buy presents,
we don't do laundry.

Someone's very grumpy.

You got your period?
<i>No.</i>

It's Sushi night,
actually.

<i>You're not still</i>
<i>doing that, are you?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

You might as well wear
a t-shirt saying,

"hi, I'm ovulating.
Do you want to fuck?"

What's the romance in that?
<i>Darling, you do know,</i>
<i>if I had the money, I'd...</i>

well, actually,
I'd first go buy
a new washing machine,

but then after that
I'd pay for you
to go private.

<i>I'd ivf you a baby.</i>

How's tom?

He's just spending
every waking minute
at the house.

You're so lucky to have him.

And you're so lucky to have him.

<i>(Mike)
Tom. Tom.</i>

You up there?

What you doing?
Didn't you hear me?

Job I just finished
had a little extra.

<i>Thought you
could use them.</i>

You all right, mate?

I think we're going
to lose the house.
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

I thought you were
coming along.
<i>Yeah.</i>

Not far enough.

Pumped all the money into it.

Half my budget
went into this
fucking dry rot.

What does Anna say?

I haven't told her, yet.

She only knows half of what
I spent and she's already
freaking out.

We're trying to start a family.
Can't even afford the rent
on our apartment.

Just talk to her, mate.
She'll understand.

Come on.

If you're up for it,
a friend of mine needs some
painting done next week.

Won't pay much, but...

yeah.
Thanks.

It's a good thing
I have a master's degree.
Come in handy.

See you, bud.

Tom Wright?
Yeah.

You're served.

We've got two weeks?

Thanks.

[Muffled music]

Ben.

Turn it down.

<i>[Door closes]</i>

<i>(Anna)
Hello?</i>

<i>[Door opens]</i>

Hi.

Hi.

It's, uh, Sushi night?

<i>You forgot.</i>

No. No.

I never forget
Sushi night.
It's fine.

Nice wine.

<i>It was just
a few quid extra.</i>

A very nice wine.
<i>And I thought</i>
<i>it was worth it.</i>

Of course it's worth it.

Come here.

Sushi night.

How's Julian?

He's... Loud and...

tonight,
yeah?

Someone's going to get pregnant.

Hey.

You okay?

We're going to lose the house.

No.

No.
We're going
to work it out.

<i>Mike just got me
a few days on a good job.</i>

Maybe it's time
we go back.
No.

<i>No.</i>
Tom.

This was my idea.

I promised you a fresh start.

I promised you a place
to start a family.

That was then.

I'm not giving up.

So... You can shut up.

Tonight
is Sushi night.

I'm feeling lucky.

<i>[Loud muffled music]</i>

<i>Ben.</i>

<i>[Loud muffled tv]</i>

Ben.

No answer.

Tom.

Ben?

I'm coming down.

Ben.

Ben?

<i>Oh, tom.</i>

<i>[Anna coughing]</i>

Oh, my God.

<i>[Indistinct police
radio chatter]</i>

I can't believe
he was down here
the whole time.

<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Right below</i>
<i>where our bedroom is.</i>

Anna.
What?

<i>Oh, my God, tom.</i>

220,000 pounds.

What the hell
was Ben doing
with this much cash?

What was he doing
living in our basement
with all this cash?

Well, he was on disability,

and maybe he had
a big settlement
after an accident?

I just don't know
why it wouldn't be
in the bank.

So, what do we do?

Hm?

We call the police.
Yeah?

<i>[Doorbell rings]</i>

Anna. Anna.
What?

Wait.
<i>[Doorbell rings]</i>

Tom.

Help me.
We shouldn't have
brought this up here.

I know.
You want to help me?

Tom.
Help me now.

I got it.
Answer the door.

Mr. Wright?
Yes.

I'm detective inspector
John halden.

So, Mr. Wright,
what-what is it you do?

<i>He's a landscape architect.</i>
Oh.

Yeah.
I used to be,
in Chicago.

I had a small business,
a little crew,

but it fell apart in the crash,

so we moved here
for a fresh start.

We also had
an unfortunate miscarriage
a few years ago, so...

oh, I'm so sorry.
So sorry.

<i>It was a nice
change for us.</i>

<i>So, now I-I do
contracting work</i>

odd jobs and manual labor.

<i>Why London?</i>
Tom's renovating
a house.

<i>My grandmother
passed a few years ago</i>

and we inherited
the family house,
so I thought I'd fix it up.

Good for you.

So, Mrs. Wright,
how are you, um,
how are you liking London?

Anna, please.

I'm a school teacher
at morningside primary
school.

My wife runs a clinic
just down the street
from there.

<i>Sterling house?</i>
<i>That's a, uh,</i>
<i>women's shelter, right?</i>

<i>Yeah. They look after young</i>
<i>women with drug addiction,</i>
<i>take them off the streets.</i>

<i>The government</i>
<i>has withdrawn its funding,</i>
<i>but they're hanging in there.</i>

My wife, Marie,
isn't one for giving up.


Anyhow...

So, thank you for the tea.

<i>It was very good.</i>

How long have
you been renting
the room downstairs?

Uh, not long.

I mean, we just did it
'cause we needed help
with the rent.

Three months, maybe.
<i>Yeah.</i>

And he always paid by cash.
Did you find this odd?

No, not really, no.

Did he, um,

did he have any visitors?

Uh, he really kept to himself.
I mean, he didn't have much.

No.
He watched
a lot of television.

<i>Yeah, that's true.
Very loud.</i>

Did, um, did you find
anything unusual about him?

When you, um,

when you discovered
the body, did you...

did you find anything else?

Um...
no.

The reason I ask
is because the initial
police report

suggests that he died
of a drug overdose,

and the team downstairs
are just looking
for evidence

that he may
have kept drugs there.

No, we had... I mean,
we had no idea.

Well, it's just, uh...
it's just routine.

For your own safety.

<i>[Newscaster]
...Late 40's</i>

<i>discovered in the basement
of a flat.</i>

<i>The cause of death
is as yet unknown.</i>

<i>His identity</i>
<i>is being withheld</i>
<i>until relatives are traced.</i>

<i>To the city now,</i>
<i>and London's markets</i>
<i>are still not steady.</i>

<i>There's a new lead</i>

to-to the guys
that gave Julie
the drugs.

I thought Martin
took you off that case.

<i>Yeah.</i>

Is it dangerous?

<i>Really dangerous, then.</i>

<i>Still not going
to bring her back, John.</i>

So,

why take the risk?

It might save
someone else's daughter.

We'll call halden
in the morning.

<i>[Clattering]</i>

Tom?

Tom?

<i>[Pounding]</i>

What are you doing?


<i>We spent our whole lives
being good, right?</i>

And what
has it gotten us?
Nothing.

<i>So, maybe this money is a gift</i>
<i>to help us get our lives</i>
<i>back on track.</i>

Tom.

We don't know
where this money
comes from.

This could be really,
really bad money.

I know.

I know.

But what makes money bad?

Not the money.
The people make it bad.

What people do with it.

Now, I'm not saying
we do anything rash.

All I'm saying
is we just wait
and see.

He's been dead a week.

The cops came,
they didn't find anything.

No one's come forward
looking for the money.

Okay?
And if they do,

this will look like Ben hid it.

I say we just hide it

and wait a week.

Two weeks.

All right.

End of the month.
And then

nobody comes,

we just find it again.

<i>[Telephone ringing]</i>

Halden, where are
the background checks
on the Scott case?

You wouldn't be wasting time
on the Witkowski case?
I told you to drop it.

<i>Nobody gives a shit</i>
<i>if Jack Witkowski killed</i>
<i>his twat of a brother.</i>

<i>Another deficient shitsack</i>
<i>off the street is fine</i>
<i>with this department.</i>

The Scott background checks,
on my desk by five.

<i>[Door closes]</i>

And this has nothing
to do with Julie?

No, no, no, no.
It's just...

it's just a hunch
I want to follow up on.

If I'm going to break
every law I'm here
to uphold,

I'd rather it was
for a good cause.

Okay.

It has everything
to do with my daughter.

Bank accounts,
inland revenue,
utility bills, mortgage.

From now on, if Thomas
or Anna Wright sneeze,
you'll know about it.

But I warn you,
there's not much money
to follow.

No, not at the moment.

Okay.

You'll keep me posted?

If Martin finds out,
I'll be fired.

<i>Martin's a smug
little prick.</i>

Superintendent tosspot
can go fuck himself.

<i>(Tom)</i>
<i>Detective halden?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Hi, this is
tom Wright from the...</i>

<i>how are you?
We were just wondering</i>

<i>if you heard anything</i>
<i>about the next of kin</i>
<i>for Ben tuttle.</i>

<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>We haven't located</i>
<i>any living relatives.</i>

I just ask because, uh,

we wanted to know
what do with his things,
his clothes and stuff.

<i>No, no one's come
forward, yet.</i>

Okay.

And, uh,
do you know,
was it officially...

yeah, overdose.

Looks like it was liquid o.

<i>What's liquid o?</i>
Heroin.

<i>I see.
Wow.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Have a good day.</i>
Bye.

<i>(Jack)</i>
<i>You met my little brother,</i>
<i>haven't you?</i>

Always tried to let him win.

Any game.

Drove mom crazy.

Said Bobby
would never learn
if we did that.

'Course she was right.

<i>Jack and Bobby.
How it came to this?</i>

Mom was a fan.

<i>She also had
high expectations.</i>

Where's cousin Ben?

You know, when you
recommend a guy,

<i>you're tying
his name to yours.</i>

Did you know
he was going
to fuck me?

If you tell me where I find him,

maybe I'll choose
to believe you on that.

Eddie, sir,
could I please
trouble you for a pen?

You done the right thing.

<i>But that doesn't mean</i>
<i>I'm not going to hold you</i>
<i>accountable.</i>

[Muffled whimper]

Anna.
Yeah.

I spent some of the money.

What?

<i>The day we found Ben,</i>

<i>the landlord gave us
an eviction notice.</i>

<i>I was going to tell you,</i>
<i>but you were in such</i>
<i>a good mood,</i>

<i>and it was Sushi night.</i>

And then we found
the money, and...

I took just enough
to keep the roof
over our heads.

Look, we're in this.

<i>As soon as we put the money</i>
<i>in the oven and we didn't</i>
<i>take it out, we were in this.</i>

If we don't start paying off
the mortgage, we're going
to lose the house.

How do we do this?

We spend just enough
to stop the bleeding.

We use cash where we can,

and we get Mike
to write an invoice.

You want to bring Mike
into this?

No, it's not like that.
We're not bringing him
into it.

But when I do
a job for him,
he usually pays me cash,

and then writes an invoice.

So, if anyone asks...

<i>right, there's a paper trail.</i>

What if someone comes
looking for it, tom?

Anna.

Nobody's come.

Nobody's going to come.

And if they do,

who's to say
Ben didn't spend it?

How much are we talking?

Just enough to stay above water.

The mortgage,
credit cards.

Just so we're in the clear.

There's only one problem
that I can think of.

What?
You are going to be
really lonely

when the debt collectors
stop calling.


Hi, this is Anna Wright.
I'm calling to inquire
about an appointment.

Yeah, for an ivf
consultation,
if possible.

Hello.

Fuck, fuck, fuck.

<i>[Cell phone ringing]</i>

Halden.
<i>It's Duncan.</i>

Yeah, what's up?
Not much.

I'm calling
'cause we got a flag.

The Americans?
Yeah.

You were right.
A lot of activity today.

Mr. Wright made
five separate payments.

<i>I've got deposits</i>
<i>to the current account,</i>
<i>mortgage and credit cards.</i>

Cash?
Some cash.
Some money transfers.

<i>He spread it out.</i>
<i>No single payment big enough</i>
<i>to raise flags at the bank.</i>

<i>[Train rolling by]</i>

Fuck.

We found the liquid o.

What about the cash?

<i>[Door opens]</i>

<i>[Clanking]</i>

<i>[Footsteps]</i>

<i>(Halden)
Mr. Wright?</i>

Detective.

It looks like someone
came for Ben's stuff
after all.

Yeah.

Who do you think would do this?

Your tenant crossed
a very bad man.

That man's name
is Jack Witkowski.

So, who called the police?

No one.

I just wanted to talk to you.

Yeah, well, why?

Let's go upstairs.

I'm sorry.

It's not back there.
It's in my car.

But I-I-I did just get
an invoice from, um,
Mike Calloway.

This Mike Calloway,
he's a friend of yours?

He is,
but I do a lot
of work with him,

and he owed me on two jobs,

and we got paid upfront
for this other thing
last week.

If you're holding anything back,

you better tell me.

I don't quite understand.

<i>The dead tenant,</i>
<i>Ben tuttle,</i>
<i>drug abuse,</i>

sudden activity
in your bank account,

<i>and now, coincidentally,
a break-in.</i>

<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to accuse you</i>
<i>of anything.</i>

I just want to clarify things.

<i>(Anna)
You're welcome.</i>

<i>[Door opens]</i>

Hey.

Hey.
Ouch.

Sorry, I have
to take this.

<i>Would you do me a favor</i>
<i>and please don't mention</i>
<i>the break-in to my wife?</i>

She's been
a little rattled
since Ben died.

No, really, it's fine.

Tom finally got paid
on that big job I was
telling you about.

Oh, my God.
I can't believe that.

Oh, no,
that's too much.

Sarah, I got to go.
Okay, bye.

<i>So, this Mike Calloway,
he pays you in cash?</i>

Sorry, what are you implying?

I'm implying nothing.

I was inquiring
about the deposit,
and your husband cleared it up.

So, all's good.

The worst part
is behind us,
right, baby?


Yeah.

It's all good.

Yo.
Hey.

Bloody hell.
What?

Quality stuff.
Yeah.

I thought you said
you were going to lose
your house.

Mike.
<i>Yeah.</i>

Can I tell you something?

<i>[Cell phone ringing]</i>

Hang on.

This is tom Wright.

Sure.
What kind of job?

Okay, I'm interested.

Yeah, I'll come by
with my partner.

Fine, I'll come alone.

Okay.
See you then.

Looks like
we might have
another job.

<i>(Tom)</i>
<i>French guy, bought</i>
<i>a big house in notting</i> hill.

Mr. Wright.
<i>Hi.</i>

Please take a seat.
<i>Thanks.</i>

You can call me tom.
You're mister...

you must forgive me.
English is not
my first language.

Okay.

And you,
you're American, yes?
<i>I am.</i>

I live here now.
And you, you just moved
to the area?

I'm expanding my empire.

Tell me, Mr. Wright,
are you a team player?

I-I guess.

Do you want to talk
about the renovations,
mister...

Genghis Khan.

Genghis Khan?
Is that what you said?

Do you know this man?

Uh, genghis Khan, yeah.

I mean,
I've heard of him...

he marched all over the world.

Countries were so afraid
of this man,

they would lay down
their arms when they heard
of his approach.

Do you know what happened
when they did that?

No, I don't know.
Nothing.

Nothing happened.

The great Khan
welcomed them into
his kingdom with open arms.

But those that resisted,

felt his full fury.

He burned the cities,
killed the men,

raped their women,
salted their crops.

Okay.

Um...

I'm sorry, I...

I think I'm probably
not the right guy for this,

so maybe
you should get someone else
for the renovations, okay?

<i>Recently,</i>
<i>a group of men</i>
<i>stole from me.</i>

<i>Where I come from,
this would not happen.</i>

But I'm new here, so...

it's not the product
that matters,

it's a question of honor.

<i>So now
I'm burning cities,</i>

I'm salting crops.

And you have housed my enemy.

<i>Ben tuttle.</i>

Oh, I see.

Okay, yes...
have you heard
of Jack Witkowski?

<i>This man dishonored me.</i>

So, here's
my question for you
and your lovely wife, Anna.

<i>Are you team players?</i>

What do you mean?
Whose team are you on?

I'm not on anybody's team.

<i>If you're not
on anybody's team,</i>

you are not on my team.

So, whose team are you on?

Detective halden,
it's tom Wright.

I need your help.

Babe, it's me.
Can you give me...

where's my money?

<i>Where's my money?</i>

I don't know what
you're talking about.

Me and my brother's money.

Are you an idiot,
you fucking cunt?

And he died getting it.

So, you can understand me
wanting it back.

Now, where is it?

I don't know.

Please.

Please.

Where's the money?




So, that's how you want to play.

<i>[Cell phone ringing]</i>

It's fine with me.

<i>[Echoing]</i>
<i>I didn't want</i>
<i>to go this far.</i>

Please...

Please, stop.
Please.

Where's my money?

Please.
<i>Where's is it?</i>

Please stop.

Where's my money?


Fuck!

Hm.

<i>[Train rolling by]</i>

<i>[Door opens]</i>

Anna.

Anna, no.

Welcome home, Mrs. Tommy.

Tom.

The police are coming.
Just stall.

I'm okay.

<i>[Anna whispering]
Oh, my God.</i>

That's enough.

Get up.

Up!

This is what Tommy has.

<i>Didn't you know?</i>
<i>When you find</i>
<i>a pot of gold,</i>

there's always
a monster guarding it.

<i>You smell so nice.</i>

Just relax.

Stop.
It's downstairs.

Bullshit.
I looked all over.

<i>It's in the window frame.</i>

I hid it in the window frame.

Tom's lying.

He's afraid that
if he gives you the money,
you're going to kill us.

Fuck.

Where's the fucking money?

Promise me you won't kill us.

No.

One, two...

<i>[Doorbell ringing]</i>

Stop pissing about.

Which one?

Three, four, five.

<i>[Doorbell ringing]</i>

This one.

It's this one.

<i>[Car horn honking]</i>

<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

<i>[Honking]</i>

<i>(Tom)
We're in here.</i>

<i>Downstairs.
He's downstairs.</i>

<i>[Honking]</i>

<i>[Tires screeching]</i>

<i>(Halden)</i>
<i>You're in serious trouble,</i>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Wright.</i>

You stole some money
and you spent it,

<i>so you're going
to prison.</i>

Do we need to get a lawyer?

A lawyer won't change that.

Turning it in won't change it
unless you can turn
all of it in.

No, I didn't think so.

And Jack Witkowski
isn't the kind of guy
to forgive and forget.

He'd find a way to get
to you before we could even
bring you to trial.

I've tried to arrest him
for two years.

He's got ties to the police.

Someone who turns
a blind eye to what
he does.

There are some people
in Scotland yard that think

that Jack is doing us a service.

He kills his fair share
of bad people.

They believe
that one in the hand
is worth five in the street.

Think they
can... Control him.

<i>(Anna)
But you don't.</i>

After he's paid off

whichever fucking
corrupt coppers
are protecting him,

he sells his stuff
on the street at cut price.

<i>He targets
young women,</i>

<i>single mums,</i>

people he thinks he can control.

That's his specialty.

There is a way out of it.

What?
You help me,
I'll help you.

When Jack
comes after you,
we set a trap.

How?
You say he took
your phone.

Yeah.
When he calls,

you agree to take
the money to him.

You want to use us as bait?

No.

All right, wait...
no.

Just... if we-if we do it,
that means we walk.
<i>This doesn't go in the books.</i>

If I took this
to headquarters,
Jack would get wind of it,

I'd be out of a job,
you two would be dead.

Find somewhere safe for tonight.

<i>(Anna)
Tom.</i>

<i>Tom.</i>

<i>You know he would've
killed you, right?</i>

<i>You told me to stall.</i>
<i>You told me the police</i>
<i>were coming.</i>

Before.

Why didn't you
just show him where
the money was?

Why didn't you
tell me somebody
broke into our house.

I just wanted us
to have a little money
so we wouldn't get evicted,

so we could have...
<i>[Pounding on wall]</i>
<i>Shut up!</i>

So we could have a life.

I went to the fertility clinic,

<i>and I spent some of the money.</i>

I'm sorry.

I feel so stupid.

<i>It's okay.</i>

Something was wrong with me.

I just...

it's okay.

Come here.
Come here.

All we wanted was a family.

<i>[Telephone ringing]</i>

<i>(Tom)
It's him.</i>

Hello?

<i>(Jack)</i>
<i>Knock, knock.</i>
<i>Room service.</i>

<i>So, where have you put it?</i>
<i>In the hotel safe</i>
<i>or under the bed?</i>

<i>How can you fuck
on that dirty mattress?</i>

<i>People like you
are so predictable, Tommy.</i>

All right,
you can have your money.
Just leave us alone.

<i>I want to see you
and the money.</i>

When?
Where?

It needs to be in public
for my safety.

<i>Tomorrow, noon,</i>
<i>Victoria park</i>
<i>by the pond.</i>

And then you leave us alone.

<i>[Phone off the hook]</i>

What now?

The, um,
the tracking device
is sewn into the seam.

It's virtually undetectable,
and I can track you
on my phone.

As soon as you see him,
put the bag down
and walk away.

Don't run,
don't look back.

No exceptions,
no heroics,
no nothing.

Just drop and go.

And when we're gone,
you'll arrest him?

Yes, as soon
as he picks up
the bag, it's over,

by which time
you'll be gone
and safe.

You'll be under
constant supervision.

My men will be watching you,
but you won't see them.

All right.

Drop and go.

Okay.

<i>(Anna)</i>
<i>He's going</i>
<i>to get us killed.</i>

<i>(Tom)
Not if we have back-up.</i>

<i>[Elevator ding]</i>

<i>Bonjour.
EnchantÃ©e.</i>

You must be Anna.

I take it Jack Witkowski
paid you a visit.

Yeah.

So, tell me,
Mr. and Mrs. Wright,

what is the plan
you want to speak
to me about?

Where is he?

He'll call us.

<i>[Cell phone ringing]</i>

Where are you?
You're late.

<i>Tell me, Tommy,</i>
<i>why are our good friends</i>
<i>from the met joining us?</i>

Don't worry about him.
He's not with us.

Just let him walk by
and you can have your money.

<i>I'm not talking</i> about
<i>that one, you tosser.</i>
<i>He works for me.</i>

Wave to the good
people, Marshall.

<i>I'm talking about that
mangy fuck, halden.</i>

<i>[Gunshots]</i>

<i>[People screaming]</i>

Run.
Drop the bag.

Fuck.

Marshall, you fucking dick,
get the fucking money.

Drop the bag, tom.

<i>[Gunshots]</i>

Drop the bag.

Drop the bag.
Run.

<i>Anna, run.</i>

<i>[Tires screeching]</i>

<i>(Anna)</i>
<i>Why didn't you</i>
<i>just drop the money?</i>

<i>'Cause the money's</i>
<i>the only thing keeping us</i>
<i>alive right now.</i>

<i>Halden is dead.</i>

I know.

They killed him.
I know.

Anna.

<i>What are we going
to do, tom?</i>

<i>Where are we going to go?</i>

<i>We have one place
where we can go.</i>

At least for a few hours.

<i>(Khan)
You broke your word.</i>

<i>Do you think
I would let you play me?</i>

<i>(Tom)</i>
<i>I'm not trying</i>
<i>to play you, Khan.</i>

When I find you,

just remember
you brought this
on yourselves.

Would you mind
giving us a minute
in private, Mrs. halden?

Yeah, I was going
to grab a coffee anyway.

What in God's name
were you thinking?

Not only were you wearing
a bulletproof vest,

but you took a firearm
into a public park.

There are children there,
for Christ's sake.

You're an embarrassment.

You should've retired
when your junkie daughter
died.

<i>[Nurse]</i>
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>
<i>Mr. halden needs to rest.</i>

<i>Okay, my apologies.</i>

You rest up, John.

Good news for me is

now I don't have
to pay your pension.

<i>Who's going to pay
your pension, ray?</i>

Scotland yard or guys
like Jack Witkowski?

I wanted to fix the floor
before I showed it to you.

It's a little
different upstairs.
You want to see?

Yeah.

Remember when we started
working on the house

and we'd eat
take-away on the floor?

Yeah.

Remember when I thought
I'd be done in four months?

Remember when I thought
I'd be pregnant in six?

I'm sorry I stopped coming here.

I'm sorry I got lost
in this place.

I never needed the house, tom.

<i>All I needed was us.</i>

<i>I know.</i>

We're going to make it.

Tell me we're going to make it.

<i>[Footsteps]</i>


<i>It's okay, boo-boo.
I'm coming.</i>

<i>Give me your phone.</i>

Give me your phone.

<i>[Cell phone ringing]</i>

Sarah?

<i>(Jack)
You smell so lovely.</i>

Julian's a real peach.

Hello?

<i>You want kids,
don't you, Tommy?</i>

<i>Me, too.</i>

Such a precious gift.

So, hurting little Julian

it's not going
to be easy for me.


He's so smooth.

<i>What's your plan, Tommy?</i>

What's your plan, Tommy?

<i>We can't go out.</i>
<i>After the park, the police</i>
<i>are looking for us, too.</i>

We're hiding out
in an old house
in west London.

<i>I'll text you
the address</i>

<i>and you come meet us here.</i>

Okay?

No more tricks.

Keep fucking quiet.

[Tires screeching]

Better text Khan.

Yeah.

You really think
he's going to come?

<i>Yeah.</i>

It's all about honor
with that guy.

Sent.

You know they're going
to have guns, right?

Guns are for pussies.


<i>[Cell phone ringing]</i>

Yeah.

Look who's come
for dinner.

Anna?

Get ready.

This is the perfect place.

For what?

<i>I see no cash.</i>

It's in the house.
Safe.

Don't fuck with me.

<i>Jack, you can have the money</i>

just as soon
as we get Sarah
and Julian.

<i>Where's Mrs. Tommy?</i>

She's inside,
with the money.

What the fuck.

Honey, I'm home.

Mrs. Tommy.

[Cocks gun]

<i>You got five seconds</i>
<i>to show me the money</i>
<i>or I'm shooting your husband.</i>

<i>(Anna)
The money's up here.</i>

How can I be sure?

<i>I just want Sarah,
I want Julian,</i>

<i>but if you hurt them
or my husband,</i>

<i>I will destroy
all of it.</i>

That's impressive.
I'll get them over.


<i>Get the fuck out, love.</i>

Now it's your turn.

Well done, sweetheart.

Now the bag.

Jack?

Are you all right?

[Weak chuckle]

<i>[Nailing]</i>

Sarah!

<i>(Anna)
Sarah!</i>

<i>[Gunshots]</i>

Go out the ladder.

<i>[Whispering]</i>
<i>Sarah, go out</i>
<i>the ladder.</i>

[Muffled grunt]

Oh, God.
Give me Julian.
Give me Julian



<i>[Julian crying]</i>

<i>[Jet flies by]</i>


<i>[Jet flies by]</i>

<i>[Sarah screams]</i>

<i>[Boards creak]</i>

Andre?

<i>[Boards creak]</i>

<i>(Khan)</i>
<i>You betrayed me,</i>
<i>Mr. Wright.</i>

<i>You cannot undo that.</i>

You must be sacrificed
<i>pour le bien de tous.</i>

<i>[Nail gun fires]</i>

<i>The greater good.</i>


Does not seem fair.

You are playing with toys
while I am not playing
at all.

You are a worthy adversary.

<i>[Gunshot]</i>

Ahh!

Anna.

<i>Anna.</i>


<i>Anna.</i>

<i>[Gunshot]</i>

<i>[Lady newscaster]</i>
<i>Metro police today</i>
<i>announced a breakthrough</i>

<i>in a case that's traumatized</i>
<i>people living in the sleepy</i>
<i>London suburb of mortlake.</i>

<i>It comes just 36 hours</i>
<i>after a shootout which left</i>
<i>five people dead</i>

<i>a house burnt to the ground,</i>
<i>and the entire community</i>
<i>in shock.</i>

<i>With me is superintendent
ray Martin,</i>

<i>one of the officers
in charge of the case.</i>

<i>Superintendent,
what can you tell us?</i>

<i>We can now confirm
that these tragic events</i>

<i>are directly linked
to a drug turf war</i>

<i>which began with an armed</i>
<i>robbery that turned deadly</i>
<i>in an east end night club</i>.

<i>(Halden)</i>
<i>Remarkable.</i>
Hi.

<i>...and extraordinary bravery</i>
<i>of veteran detective</i>
<i>John halden</i>

<i>a man I consider to be</i>
<i>a personal friend</i>
<i>and a colleague.</i>

It's easy to be a hero
when you're writing
your own story.

Uh, the firemen found this.

It's, um...

it's not much,
but, uh, it's yours.

Good luck.

<i>[Muffled voices]</i>

Hm.

What took you so long?

I just had to do one last thing.

All right.
Say goodbye
to this hell hole.

Come on.

So, no more Sushi nights.
