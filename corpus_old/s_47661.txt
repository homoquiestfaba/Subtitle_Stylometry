When I first saw you, I wasn´t scared.

Just wondered why you wore those boots.

Now I know.

KETCHAM: Shit!


KETCHAM:
We´ve both played this game, Rath.

What kind of shoes will you be wearing...

...when your day comes?

I´ll double the contract.

Say you couldn´t find me.

Listen to me.

I´m talking like a mark!

[Gun clicks]

KETCHAM: Oh, God. Don´t pull yet.

Not yet.

KETCHAM: I´ve killed a few innocents
in my time.

You´re so high and mighty!
You and your principles!

KETCHAM: Someone had to do
the jobs you wouldn´t do.

I can´t die like this!

I´m not a mark.

Not like a mark.


It´s chambered.

Thanks, Rath.

Who are you, kid?

Robert Rath...

...wants to know me.

I don´t believe this.

Bain.

Miguel Bain.

Let me see. You rolled some cabbie...

...then waited for the right call.

That´s genius, man.

Then you got the balls to bullshit with me.

No way I could have done that.

You stole my contract.

How´d you know of it?

A silenced...

...Ruger .22.

Classic.

You know, I switched...

...when I heard you used one.

Excuse this.

It was a long shot.

But a good one.

You could´ve had me at the cemetery
but you couldn´t shoot the cops.

You are anticuado.

[Glass pops]

[Bain cackling]

I had to try! Who knows?
Maybe it wasn´t made in America!


BAIN: Oh! Whoa, whoa.

[Sirens screaming]

Ooh.

They look pissed, huh?

RATH: They get that way
when you kill 4 of them.

How do you like the cemetery?

Rome, 14 B.C.

They killed a general, Flavius,
at his brother´s funeral.

I couldn´t wait for Branch´s brother to die,
so I killed him too.

Proud of me, Bobby?

Well....

It was nice meeting you.

he´s living on some Greek island.

But I say, you were the best!

I say, Nicolai´s dead as a doornail!

Am I right, Bob?

I heard you guys played chess coded

Ten fucking miles of microfilm!

But I found it! I found it!

BAIN:
The last game ends before anyone wins!

You killed him to be number one.

No, thanks. I won´t have any.
I´m just going to have some coffee.

Oh! You know what? I forgot to tell you.

This is good. I like this one.

It´s your good side. Look.

That´s not so bad.

And you say you don´t photograph well.

No, wait.

Fuck.

Don´t do this.

[Breathing heavily]

Pearl, come on.

[Pearl meows]

[Electra gasps]

[Electra yelps]

Don´t!

Don´t?

Don´t what?

Rath...

[Bain chuckling]

The disk.

BAIN: lt´s you.

BAIN: lt´s you.

Disk.

BAIN: You tried the move.

Bishop takes rook pawn.

It´s a powerful move.

Would have been Nicolai´s move.
Don´t you think?

You got a move for me, Rath?

Huh?

You know, it´s like chess.

Is she alive?

BAIN: Did you kill her?

BAIN: Did you kill my mark?


Are you there, sweetie?

542.

Is she dead yet, Bobby?

BAIN: I took care of business on my end.
Did you?

[Electra shrieks]

[Bain cackles]

BAIN: A woman.
It´s not the same as killing a man.

You have to pull the trigger
a different way.

Is she beautiful, Bobby?

Pull the trigger. Kill her.


Pull the trigger.

[Electra sobbing]

Pull the trigger. Kill her. Be professional.

BAIN: Kill her.

You´ll know when we get there.

[Computer keys clicking]

RATH: Slow down.

I can´t, I´m too nervous.

RATH: Slow down.

This other guy,

It´s between you and him, right?

We can´t.

You´re the mark.

Why are you here? How are you?

Where´s her mama?

I was going to ask you that.

BAIN: Thank you, pussycat.

Cold.

BAIN: Cold.

Hot.

So that´s where you live.

BOB ON TV: I really love you.

BAIN ON TV: I love you, too.

I´m sorry!

Jasmine.

[Multiple silenced gunshots]

[Mirror smashes]

BAIN: Your gun is slow!

[Bain speaks in Spanish]

I´m not the one shooting at mirrors.

Who do you think--

BAIN: Surprise.

[Jennifer gasps]

The disk.

The disk!

[Jennifer sobs in fear]


[Silenced gunshot,
Jennifer breathes heavily]


Disk.


I got the buyers.

BAIN: Now, I beat you to the mark.

I´m sorry...

...but I think I picked
the wrong guy to be my hero.

[Multiple silenced gunshots]

BAIN: Macho. Macho.

[Breathing heavily] You know...

...it´s my birthday.

BAIN: Today...

...I become number one.

And I got a present....


Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

[Multiple shots, glass smashes]

Happy birthday.

[Hissing of gas pipe as it ignites]

Shit!

[Flames roar, glass smashes]

[Sirens blare, horns honk]

RATH: Goddamn it.

ELECTRA: The girl from downstairs,
I saw her come back here.

She´s not in her apartment. She could
be here somewhere. I must find her.

She´s dead.

[Sirens wail]

ELECTRA: Come here, Pearl.

Get back here.

Hello, Pearl.

Come here, girl.

She likes me.

She likes dead fish too.

What´s your name?

Robert Rath.

Right.

I´m Electra.

Are you one of them?

Was.

Retired.

I don´t believe you.

RATH: I told you...

...if I wanted to kill you...

...I would have already.

Look what she did.

It´s not loaded?

It´s loaded. It´s silenced.

Just shoot.

I could.

I´d be 500 miles away
before they found you.

How´s that?


I say she´s afraid she might hit you.

[Gunshots, smashing]

Sorry I have the gun?

ELECTRA: You think it was a mistake?
You think I´m scared?

You don´t know me!

-You´re wrong. I know--
-Shut up!

ELECTRA: Today was supposed to be
a good day.

Payday.

40 grand.
I was going to buy Pearl a boyfriend.

Now two people are dead.

ELECTRA: I´m in way over my head.

I just want out.

You got the gun. The key´s on the dresser.

Go.

I don´t have a social security number,
or a driver´s license.

I barely remember my real name.

I´m a ghost. I´m nobody.

I´ll disappear.

I found you. So did he. You can´t hide.

I just want my life back.

That´s all.

I´m sorry.

[Silenced gunshots, glass smashing]

RATH: I´ll take that.

I need to be alone.

I haven´t spent this much
time with someone in years.

Neither have I.

Well, the disk....

You´ll get it.

[Rath chuckles]


Fuck you.

I don´t care what you are.

Fuck you!

Then who the hell´s Miguel Bain?

Who the hell is Miguel Bain?

Christ.

[Pearl meows, toilet handle clinks]

[Voice of television reporter]

[Pearl meows]

RATH: Hello, Pearl.

ELECTRA: What´d they say
about the shooting?

RATH: Nothing.

I don´t need details, just in general.

-Nothing.
-Impossible.

Not really. Not if....

If what?

The CIA or lnterpol....

What´s on this?

It´s encrypted.

Breaking the code on my lap top
could take 200 or 300 years.

Aren´t you a genius?

I am.

ELECTRA: I was the best.
If it was stored electronically, it was mine.

Was?

Yeah, I´m retiring too.

I wish I had an insight...

...but it was anonymous,
an intercepted satellite transmission.

ELECTRA: Probably just industrial secrets.

There´s one bed.

ELECTRA: I guess you noticed that.

-It´s yours.
-You want the couch?

No, thanks.

A trick so you don´t get comfortable?

Tie a string from your toe to the doorknob.

It opens in.

You wouldn´t feel it.

Yeah, I got it. I understand.

[Pearl meows]

Pearl!

Thanks.

For what?

I don´t know.

Saving my life, I guess.

How´d you like to make $1 million?

ELECTRA: What do I have to do?

Nothing cheap, I hope.

What is it?

Tell you tomorrow.

I can´t sleep.

Be patient.

What? Tell me.

Thanks for the chocolate.

ELECTRA: Good night.

ELECTRA: Forget something?

You be careful.

What´s going on?

ELECTRA: I´ll move!

[Dogs barking]

RATH: I hate that music.

ELECTRA: Let´s go.

ELECTRA: Got it? ls it all there?

[Static and distortion sounds]

What´re you doing?

-Drive!
-What?

Drive, fast!

RATH: I mean, fast!

Get off this street!

[Tires screech]

RATH: Stop!

Hit it!

Go!

[Violent explosion]

No money, no disk.

What´s so funny?

I wasn´t sure you´d come back
so I switched the disks.

And all they have is file names.

-No, you didn´t.
-Yes, I did.

And they got bubkes. Zero, zilch...

...zot, nix, nada, dry hump, squirt...

...diddley-squat.

I read a slang dictionary once.

Keep reading.

Contractor tried to kill you.

ELECTRA: That´s not good.

ELECTRA: Come here, Pearl.

I have caviar for you.

Come here!

Good girl.

"Caviar" is not a Russian word.

RATH: lkra. I think the word is ikra.

How do you know?

I had a Russian friend, Nicolai.
He told me.

ELECTRA: Had a friend?

RATH: Yeah.

RATH: About 15 years ago he was taken.

He was killed?

[Gun clicks as loaded]

[Computer beeps]

Yes, I´m still alive, you bastard.

RATH: Not this time.

Let´s see how valuable he thinks this is.

Three million?

Four?

RATH: More.

$20 fucking million?

Where do you suppose
this person is right now?

A mile away?

1,000 miles from here?

Never thought about it till now.

You quit your job,
you have thoughts you never had before.

Sounds like a mid-life crisis.

You´re right.

Twenty million dollars.

We´re partners?

That´s $10 million apiece.

8. The bank keeps 20%%.

I thought I was a thief.

Passport?

12. Where to?

To the bank.

[Bain howls]

[Classical guitar plays Spanish tune]

What happened to the hotel?

CABBIE: They had a fire years ago.
Nobody had money to fix it.

-Wait here.
-Okay.

ELECTRA:
Keep the air on and watch my cat.

CABBIE: You got it.

ELECTRA: ls that our bank?

Where our money is?

What´s up there?

He´ll be.

[Crash as floor caves in]

RATH: Hug the wall.

ELECTRA: Careful.

RATH: Go light.

[Gun clicks as loaded]

ELECTRA: You okay?

RATH: Ten o´clock tomorrow morning,
I´m going in that bank.

He´ll be in the plaza somewhere,
in the crowd.

When he sees me go in,
he´ll make his move up here.

You´ll be in the cafe over there.

You´ll see him when he goes inside.

Then we wait.

We wait.

Tomorrow will be a long day for him.

He´ll begin to doubt himself.
He´ll think he missed me.

He´ll want to see whether
I´m still in the bank.

Then it´ll be sunset...

...closing time.

He´ll get desperate...

...real desperate...

...but he must leave his rifle...

...inside.

He´s right-handed.

He won´t take a pistol because
the doors have metal detectors...

...and he´ll be nervous.

When he´s out of sight...

...you come get the rifle.

He´ll shoot you before you go in.

He´ll wait for the prime shot.

When I come out.

He´ll want to see my eyes.


[Flapping of birds´ wings]

Why´re you so sure?

He loves history.

15 years ago...

...in this room...

...in this same window...

...I was here.

Oh, my God.

Your friend, Nicolai. He was taken.

You killed him.

[Classical guitar begins]

MERCHANT: Gracias.
BAIN: lt´s fine.

[Memorial parade singing religious song]

Who is it?

WAITER: Room service.

I didn´t order room service.

ELECTRA: I did.

You should tell me these things.

Where should I put the tray?

Over here´s fine.

What´s going on outside?

The Day of the Dead.

What´re the flowers for?

The families make a path from
their homes to the cemetery...

...with the flower petals...

...so the souls of the dead
can find their way home.

That´s nice.

Call me anytime for the tray.

Okay, gracias.

Gracias seòor.

Sounds great, huh? Can we go?

No, he´s here now. I know he is.

So we´re staying in the hotel.

The enemy of fun.

I got you a beer.

ELECTRA: Hey, Pearl. Come here.

[Singing continues]

Electra....

I wish I could explain to you why...

...I killed Nicolai.

At the time it was
the right thing to do, but...

...I´m sorry I did it.

It´s something I´ve had
to live with for 15 years.

I used to wish it would happen to me...

...and that´d be my way out.

Permanently.

But not any more.

Not since I met you.

Electra?

[Ceremonial music continues]

-Comprende inglés?
-No.

Too bad you don´t understand English.

I would like to tell you how wonderful
this cemetery is. It´s gorgeous.

I love cemeteries. I really do. I really do.

You´re here, the next day you´re there.
I put a lot of people down there.

A lot of people down there.

[Women giggle]

[All speak Spanish,
women speak with a tone of surprise]

[Bell rings]

[Bell rings]

Jasmine.

[Electra gasps]

Jasmine.


[Silenced gunshot]

[Gun clicks as loaded]

I just killed your brother.

"Contract has been paid...

"...transferred to the specified account."

And her disk?

"You´ll be advised. Good-bye, Robert."

Good-bye.

Let´s get ready.

Don´t lose this.

Two-way?

They saw you coming.
This is a piece of junk.

Tell me when he leaves the hotel,
I´ll tell you when he leaves the bank.

-What´s this for?
-Just in case.

No. I can´t shoot anybody.

I can´t.

You almost shot me.

I aimed at the lamp.

Aim at him.

Ever play cowboys and lndians?

-Sure. Everybody did.
-And which were you?

An lndian.

-I was always an lndian.
-Always the lndian.

Just pretend he´s a cowboy...

...and pull the trigger.

Then pretend he gets up after.

But you must pull the trigger.

You´ve got to.

I never depended on anyone in my life.

I´m depending on you.

[Ambient street noise]

I don´t see him.

ELECTRA:
I´m looking all around the square.

RATH: I´m in the bank.

RATH: Where do I go for transfers?

Oh, my God!

He´s here.

ELECTRA: He´s going to the hotel.

He´s almost at the door.

He´s going in. He´s going in.

That´s what we wanted.
Relax, try the decaf.

ELECTRA: He must be upstairs now.
Should I stay or go in?

No. Stay? Wait, wait. I´ll just wait.

It´s hot.

ELECTRA: Goddamn, it´s hot.

RATH: I´d rather be out there than in here.

CLERK: May I help you?

RATH: I´m expecting a transfer.

CLERK 2:
Seòor, we have received your transfer.

I´d like to close the account.

Today?

Close it today?

Right now.

-How would you like the funds?
-American currency.

Would you please step right over there.
I´ll be right back.

No problem.

Mr. Rath?

You´re aware there may be
a withdrawal fee.

Yes, I am.

This will take some time.

I´ve got all day.

Take care of him.

BANK OFFICER: Please, follow me.
Right this way.

BANK OFFICER: You may sit right here.

Relax. We´ll get you some coffee.

What are you doing there?

Fuck!

[Bain breathes heavily]

RATH: Talk to me.

ELECTRA: No sign of him.
He´s just sitting up there, same as us.

RATH: I mean, talk to me.
Tell me some of that weird stuff you know.

ELECTRA: Tell you weird stuff.

Like what?

RATH: Tell me ajoke.

May I?

Sure.

Tell me something to distract me.

I´m not getting paid.

RATH: Be generous.

Once upon a time...

...there was a little sparrow...

...who, while flying south for the winter,
froze solid...

ELECTRA: ...and fell to the ground.

To make matters worse,
a cow crapped on him.

But the manure was warm
and defrosted him.

So there he is, warm and happy
to be alive and he starts to sing.

A cat comes along...

...and he clears off the manure
and eats the little bird.

ELECTRA: The moral of the story is this:

Everyone who craps on you is
not necessarily your enemy...

...and everyone who gets you out of crap...

ELECTRA: ...is not necessarily your friend.

And if you´re warm and happy...

...no matter where you are,
keep your big mouth shut.

[Rath giggles]

You like that?

ELECTRA:
I think I´m running out of stories.


RATH: Keep your eye on that building.

He must be getting impatient.

He´ll make his move soon.

Thanks for the stories.

[Bain mumbles in Spanish]

Sorry I´ve been taking up the table.

Thank you. Thank you.

[Bain gasps and mutters]


Fuck! Shit!

BANK PRESIDENT: We have deducted
our fee and are making a second count.

The funds will be available in a half hour.

I hope you are comfortable.

[Shallow gasps] No, no...no.

Oh, my God. He´s coming.

ELECTRA: He´s coming.

He waited longer than I did.

ELECTRA: Here he is.

Go.

-I have your property.
-Be right there.

Where are you?

I´m here in room 303.

[Bird squawks]

The rifle should be on the right.

If so, the gun is going to be right here.

It´s not.

What´s happening?

It´s not here.

Listen to me.

Get out now.

Damn it.

Forget the rifle. Get out.

RATH: Have you left?

Found it!

Damn hot day, isn´t it?

Scorcher.

I got it.

Tell me...

...how did you know?

Who the hell taught you?

History.

Nicolai.

15 years ago I walked into this bank
just like you.

That makes you good...

...because I was the best.

Now you feel like a mark.

You think you were sold out.

Don´t know who to trust.

And you, anticuado?

Who do you trust?

BAIN: No one.

BAIN: You´re alone. Same as me.

I don´t have it!

I don´t have the gun.

[Crash of floor caving in]

Why the sunglasses, kid?

Afraid I´ll see your eyes?

Just between you and me...

...I´m nervous.

I have $16 million in there.

This is where we can change history.

Our history.

I´m willing to give it to you...

...if you´ll let me walk.

But...

...you won´t do that.

No.

Excuse me, but...

...you are...

...pathetic.

You sound like a mark.

BAIN: What happened to you?

Nothing. I know where you´re going.

I tell you...

...that night in the taxi...

...I thought I was lucky just to be alive.

BAIN: Now...

...I think differently.

You were the lucky one.

I´m a very, very lucky man.

No more chitchat.

Good luck.

Where are you? Talk to me.

ELECTRA: Can you hear me?

Fuck.

Everything is in order.
Please, come with me.

[Electra screams]

BANK PRESIDENT:
This is awkward. It´s not really my affair...

...but I was told you would
give us something in return.

Oh God, I´m fucked. I´m fucked.

Now...

...we are closed.

BAIN: Step outside.

Step outside...

...and I´ll set you free.

BANK OFFICIAL: Excuse me, sir,
would you please sign this receipt?

BAIN: I got the sword...

...right here.

There is no shame.

BAIN: You won´t feel a thing.

Thank you for your business.

You´re welcome.

Here he is.

BAIN: Here he is.

Thank you.

We´ve got it.

We did it.

Come on.

BAIN: Step outside.

We´re in.

RATH: You there?

RATH: Where are you?

You there?

Can you hear me?

Look up.

BAIN: I want to see your eyes,
motherfucker.

BAIN: Look up.

Jasmine?

Howdy.

[Silenced gunshot, Bain groans]

[Wings flutter]

[Multiple gunshots]

[Thud, Bain screams]

[More silenced gunshots]

[Electra gasping]

RATH: Electra!

ELECTRA: [Yelling] Yes.

RATH: You have something of mine.

I need it now.

Shit!

BAIN: We got something for you here!

[Rapid gunfire, Rath gasps]

ELECTRA: What the fuck do I do with this?

BAIN: Two against one!

Is that your edge, Rath?

You didn´t take the mark!
You took the bribe!

[Multiple silenced gunshots]

BAIN: [Yelling] Don´t worry!

Don´t worry, I´ll take her!

He´s serious, Rath!

Even the odds!

BAIN: Are you scared, honey?

I´m going to find you!

[Electra screams]

BAIN: I told you I was going
to tear your heart out!

And I will!

I will!

I promise you that!

[Wings flutter]


[Bain yells, Electra gasps]

[Rapid gunfire]

[Bain wails]

[Thunderous smashing and crashing]

[More crashing]

RATH: Wait here.

I said, stay up there!

ELECTRA: I´m not going to.
The floor could give way!

RATH: Goddamn it,
why don´t you listen to me?

MALE VOICE: Don´t move.

Throw it away.

Throw it away!

That was no way to talk to a lady.

Nicolai.

It´s been a long time.

The years have been good to you.

Miguelito?

Never pictured him so young. A shame.

Second best, after all.

He killed you...

ELECTRA: ...15 years ago.

Yes, he did.

ELECTRA: I don´t understand.

Walking out of that bank was
the worst moment of my life.

He always went for the heart.

Predictable.

RATH: 15 years.

For 15 goddamn years...

...you let me think I´d killed you.

Son of a bitch.

Son of a bitch.

You´re forgetting you shot me.
You son of a bitch.

RATH: Why?

Why did you set me up?

The Cold War was ending.

I needed to die...

...to leave no past behind.

You delivered me.

You´re the mark?

You must be the contractor.

I´m disappointed. You were to kill her.

NICOLAl: You´re a thief.

A good one.


1:56:34,492 --> 01:56:35,925
I retired.

NICOLAl: You were so good.

I had to use both my best
to track you down.

There´s something on that disk
that would bring you to life?

NICOLAl: Enough information
to expose us all.

NICOLAl: Especially me.

Can´t you kiss and make up?

NICOLAl: This is sad for me, Robert.

Sentimental, but...

...I did not want to find you alive.

NICOLAl: First things first.

[Multiple silenced gunshots]

Don´t do this.

She´s right.

RATH: She always is.

Female intuition.

Where are you going?

BAIN: To finish something...

...you didn´t finish years ago.

What?

[Silenced gunshot]

Just to make sure.

Take it.

Are you going to kill me?

RATH: I never wanted to kill you at all.

BAIN: Help me up.

Will you?

Don´t even breathe hard.

You want to die?

Help me up.

Thank you.

Now what?

I´m finished.

What do you mean?

The history stops here.

No more.

I´m gone.

I quit.

That would make me number one.

Number one.

I can live with that...

...can you?

BAIN: Absolutamente, compaòero.

Then live with it, Miguel.

Live with it.

BAIN: It was very nice meeting you...

...Robert Rath.

It was very dangerous meeting you,
Miguel Bain.

[Bain giggles]

BAIN: You know...

...as long as you´re out there...

...I´ll never be number one.

BAIN: Say good-bye...

...Bobby.

ELECTRA: No good-byes.

Good-bye, Miguel.

[Silenced gunshots]

Thank you.

Wait a minute.

ELECTRA:
You´d better keep the disk, Robert.

RATH: My real name is Joseph.

ELECTRA: I´m Anna.
Nice to meet you, Joseph.

ELECTRA: So, Joseph,
let´s go get Pearl a boyfriend.

RATH: Sure. And after that, if you
don´t mind, I´d like to go to the hospital.
