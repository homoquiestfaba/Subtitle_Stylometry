<i>Will that be all for you?</i>

<i>There you go.
Have a good night.</i>

<i>You want this one?</i>

Where are you going?
Come on. Party time, huh?

Hey!

Hey, wait up!

Looking for company?

It's pretty shitty
out there, huh?

Hoo.

<i>I like the rain.
Keeps everybody inside...</i>

and washes everything clean.

Yeah, sure. Whatever.

<i>So, anyway,
it's 75 for a straight fuck...</i>

50 for a B.J.
And 25 for a pump and run.

Show me what you got.

Where you haulin'?

Heading home.

Lucky you.
The wig too.

So we gonna get started
here or what?

<i>Get it wet for me.</i>

<i>- Are you kiddin'?
Do it.</i>

Now!

You know what?
Screw this.

What the fuck!

You want out?

There's your exit.

You're a fucking freak.

Somebody help me!

<i>Oh, my God, Kaylal
Oh, my God, look outl</i>

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God.
Oh! Why? Why?

Are you kidding? Not funny.
I don't wanna die.

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

I'm sorry, baby.
She made me.

Mel, I did not make you.
That was totally your idea.

That's the quality time you guys want to
spend together? To kill me in my sleep?

You should wait and see
what we have in store for Vegas.

You know what I'm gonna do?
What?

<i>I'm gonna go into a dark corner,
and I'm gonna gamble by myself...</i>

while you guys go do the
whole bachelor/bachelorette thing.

<i>Don't be such a baby.
We agreed to do the parties together...</i>

so everyone would have
an equal opportunity to torture us.

Hey, chill. Chill!

I don't want you staining
the fine Corinthian leather.

What a waste
of fine Corinthian.

You dare mock the '83 Chevy
Caprice wagon?

Yes, I do. Question:
Why did we not fly to Vegas?

<i>Because Kay and I haven't seen
each other since Christmas...</i>

and I miss my little sister.

I miss you too, Sis.

Congratulations, Kay.

<i>You've found a genuine ghost town.</i>

Okay, is this place even open?

Fill her up, ma'am?
Sure.

He's kind of cute. No?

No. No.

You know, ma'am, here
at Inbred Jed's, we require
that you pay in advance.

Really?
Really.

<i>- Uh-
Okay.</i>

What the-

<i>Uh-</i>

Psych.
Okay.

Hey, whoa. Hey, whoa!

<i>Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is going on?</i>

Nik, this is my sister, Mel,
and her fiance, Bobby.

You are way hotter
in person.

Wait a minute. Is this
the guy you've been talking
to on MySpace?

<i>33,628 friends and counting...</i>

and Kayla is number one.

You're my number one.
Okay. All right. What's happening?
What's going on?

Nik's gonna be my date
in Vegas.

He took a bus all the way
from Salt Lake City to meet me.
Okay.

C- Could you please
join me in the bathroom?

Okay.

Are you kidding me?
Look, I know Brad's gonna be there tomorrow.

<i>And I haven't seen him since we broke up.
I just wanted to show up with somebody.</i>

But you barely know this guy.

I barely know you since
you moved away to be with Bobby.

Which one's yours again?

I jest.

I don't understand anything you said.
You have two things right here.

Nik and I have been talking on the phone
every day for the past five months.

Yeah, online.
Online, on the phone, over webcam.

<i>He's not a serial killer. Trust me,
I googled his name and everything.</i>

Do you need the change?

Come on. Come on.
There you go.

Check this out.

This road would be a lot faster.
No traffic, no cops.

Free at last.
No hassle from the man.

Look, I didn't tell you because I knew
you'd try to talk me out of it.

Yeah, exactly. Why do I always have to
be the voice of reason with you?

Come on, Sis.

Please? Pretty please?

I just want
to have some fun.

<i>Fine, but you have to promise
to feed him, water him...</i>

and clean up after him.
I will, I promise.

Uh, I'm not really a back roads
type of guy, buddy.

Uh, they built the highways
for a reason. Stick to 'em.

Yeah, to slow shit down, man.

<i>Think about it. The faster we get to Vegas,
the faster we start cashing in...</i>

the faster we start having fun.
Come on, Bobby.

Come on.
Let's go.

We're going to Vegas!

We've been driving over an hour and
we haven't even seen the main highway yet.

That's because we're running exactly
parallel to it, sweetheart.

<i>It's simple physics. Relax.</i>

We're fine as long
as we keep heading west.

<i>Oh, would you look at this.
A dirt road.</i>

<i>Yeah, this has to mean
civilization is close, right?</i>

<i>Or is this the main entrance to Vegas, Nik?
'Cause I don't know. I've never been.</i>

Quit busting my balls, man.
It was your map.

What the fuck is that smell?

Oh, no.
Oh, shit!

Pull the car over.
What's wrong with it?

Anywhere, pull over. Pull it over.
I am.

Okay.

Geez, just stop the car. Stop the car.

<i>- Thank you.
What are we gonna do?</i>

What is it?

The engine seized.

Did you ever think- Did you ever think
maybe you should put some oil in there?

I don't know about that stuff.

<i>She had a good run. Isn't this Grammy's car?</i>

Yeah.
Well, I'll miss her.

Aw, that's sad. I feel like
we should bury it or something.

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?

Can you hear me now?
No shit.

Which way do you think?

<i>Well, we know nothing's down
there for a hundred miles, so-</i>

<i>I say we keep going down
this way.</i>

<i>- Straight to Vegas, right, Nik?
Right, Nik.</i>

Right, Bobby.
Asshole.

Okay, guys.

We're in hell.
At least that means
we're not completely lost.

You may want to surrender your Goth pride,
Nik, and lose the black jacket.

<i>I'm not Goth, jock. Third-wave emo punk,
if you insist on using labels.</i>

Well, it's first-wave jackass
to wear black in the desert.

<i>- Tell that to the bedouins.
I will.</i>

Wait a minute. What's that?

<i>Sweet.</i>

What are we gonna do?
Bust right in, or what?

Looks like our luck's changing.

See you're good for something, jock.

Holy shit!

This mail's over a month old.

Anyone home?

Hello!
Hello!

Hello! Anyone home?

Hello.

Still got nothing.

Nik?

Nik!

<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God!</i>

What is it?

What?

Oh, I'm sorry.
These are a bitch to open sometimes.

<i>- You think they'd fix that.
We just busted down a door and broke a window.</i>

What do you want to do next?
Set this place on fire?

Where are you going?
This place is empty.

<i>Whoever lived here before hasn't lived here
for a long time. Bobby? Bobby?</i>

You scared the shit out of us.
I'm sorry, baby.

Oh, gross.

These expired, like, a year ago.

Scooby snack?

Like Scooby Doo?

I thought you said therapy
helped your sister's control issues.

I told you that because I thought
you'd never meet her.

<i>I don't see what the big deal
is. I think it's kind of sexy.</i>

<i>I'll show you sexy... later.</i>

Later, later, later.

Later, later, later.
Creepy.

All the phones are dead.
Everything's dead here.

<i>You know, this place has got to be one of those
weekend retreat slash meth-lab combo deals...</i>

<i>or something,
because this is pathetic.</i>

<i>- We should get out ofhere before sunset.
I think we should go.</i>

<i>Check this out.</i>

Wow, talk about valley of death.

Nice piece of real estate.

You know what they say.
Location, location, location.

Bobby, don't go any closer.

Don't worry.
I'll protect you.

Let's get out of here.
You wanna check out the barn?

Just what do you have in mind,
mister?

Oh, simply a wholesome appreciation
of early Western rustic architecture.

This place keeps getting
more and more charming.

Come on!

You're suck a jerk!
Asshole.

You scared me.

I'm down with the freaky, but-

This is just pushing it.

What is that?

Wow.
Our motherfucking salvation!

A 1971 Chevy Chevelle hardtop.

It's an American classic.
Dibs!

<i>Oh, no wayl</i>

Breaker, breaker, this is Captain Winky
looking for Pink Taco.

<i>- You out there, R.T.
Nobody uses C. BIs anymore.</i>

Truckers do.

God is quite literally handing us this
fine automobile. Who are we to deny him?

You are not thinking about taking this car?
What if the owners come back?

We don't really know how long these people
are gonna be gone. They could be on vacation.

<i>Or they could have died in
a freak combine/thresher accident. Who knows?</i>

<i>I mean, come on.</i>

Oh, listen to that purr.

And it's full of gas. Hop in.
Let's take this bitch for a ride.

Nobody's stealing anybody's car.

At most we're borrowing it.

Exactly. We're gonna borrow it for
a little joyride, which is guaranteed fun.

I mean, "joy" is built right
into that sentence.

Well, that's grand theft auto.

<i>- And what's the alternative?
We can't really hang out in that creepy house.</i>

She's right, Mel. We can't be out
in the desert at night.

<i>How about this? We take this car
to the nearest town.</i>

In the morning we'll rent a car, return this one
with cash inside for how much the damage is.

<i>- Right, Nik?
Yeah, uh-huh. Right.</i>

Fine.
Yes!

<i>- I'm riding shotgun.
You can ride whatever you want.</i>

<i>You got the keys?</i>

Don't worry. We'll stop by Kayla's car and
get the bags. Everything's gonna be okay.

Okay, but I'm leaving my number
in case the owner comes back.

Smart and sensible.
Just like my baby.

<i>- Come on, Mell
Come on. Let's gol</i>

<i>Let's gol</i>

Come on. Get in.

<i>All right. A II right. Thank you.
Okay, so good news.</i>

There's a car rental place in Cedar City about
an hour away. They're holding a car for us.

Oh, good. I called Michelle
to tell her we'd be late.

But I told her we'd meet
her in Vegas tonight.

See, everybody?
That wasn't such a bad little detour, was it?

Watch your head, Sis.
Oh. Thanks.

<i>See, this is a ride.</i>

<i>'92 Harley Heritage Softail Classic.</i>

Fishtail carbs,
Corbin seat, and a bitch pad.

<i>Wow, that's extremely
butch of you, Melissa. No offense.</i>

All right, let me see if I know my fiancee.
You dated a gearhead in high school.

Gary Braddock.

<i>- I thought he was so hot.
He taught us both how to ride.</i>

I just think he
wanted to hook up a threesome.

<i>And who could blame poor
Gary Braddock for that?</i>

<i>Don't worry.
It never went anywhere.</i>

I just liked to ride his bike.

<i>What the-</i>

Fuck you, asshole!

Yeah, rage against the machine, motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!

Fuck.

I got me a bodacious case
of beaver fever, that's for sure.

Your old lady finds out,
you'll be off the super slab for good.

About my 18th hour straight.

Oh, my God, is that
Shakespeare we're hearing?

<i>Take it you kids are from out of town,
on your way to Vegas?</i>

Yeah.
Yeah.

Five bucks says she's got two names,
like Amy Sue, or PeggyJo, or-

Twenty and you're on, harelip.
Here you go. Best seats in the house.

<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

I'm Nik.

I'm Jolene. That's one name,
not two. Guess you lost, pumpkin.

<i>Well, Jolene,
a round of specials, please...</i>

and my third-wave emo punk here
is gonna get the check.

Oh, that's just fantastic.

I'm already paying the bill for the window,
might as well pay for breakfast.

Thank you.

Uh-oh. Looks like we brought
chum to the shark tank.

Oh, that's romantic.
You're referring to us as piecemeal fish guts.

<i>Look around. We're surrounded by trucker trash.</i>

Just ignore 'em.
They're not bothering us.

<i>- Okay?
Of course they're not. They know their place.</i>

<i>After all, truckers are just gacked-out speed
freaks whose only hope for companionship...</i>

<i>is a disease-ridden hooker.</i>

<i>Jesus, would you lower your voicel</i>

I bet you I can get one of these convoy wack
jobs to flip their lid and storm out of here.

Come on, gambler to gambler,
give me a chance to win my money back.

You want a bet?
Here. Here's your bet.

I bet you you won't shut
the hell up for five minutes.
Five minutes? Six.

How about seven? Ten bucks?
Twenty?

I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

You're not gonna cry, are you?

Courtesy flush.

We don't want this place
smelling like a truck stop.

Um, ten bucks
if you guys make out.

<i>And another special.</i>

Oh, that's Bobby's.
Right here. Thank you.

<i>So, you and Bobby can't
stay apart long enough...</i>

to have separate
bachelor/bachelorette parties?

<i>- That's pretty sad.
Combo parties are in right now...</i>

especially when the couple has the same friends.

No, I'm not complaining.

<i>Trust me. I think
it's pretty interesting.</i>

I've always wanted to know what
goes on at a bachelorette bash.

Can I be the stripper?
You okay, Mel?

Why is Bobby taking so long?

<i>Cupcake, when we're
together four years...</i>

will you worry about me
when I'm out of your sight for 15 minutes?

<i>Oh, I'll worry about you...
cheating on me.</i>

<i>No, no, no. Give me a little
more credit than that.</i>

<i>I plan on keeping my affairs
completely discreet.</i>

LikeJames Bond.
How nice of you.

Hello?
I believe you have something of mine.

Shit. I think it's him.

Him who?
The car.

The car guy?

Goldilocks? You there?
Uh-

Goldilocks?

<i>Didn't you come into my place
when I wasn't home...</i>

just like Goldilocks
and the three bears.

Uh, yes. We're really very sorry.

We ran into an emergency, but we're bringing
the car back and money for any damages.

<i>- That's why I left my number.
No rush.</i>

<i>No rush.</i>

<i>Wouldn't want you
to worry one hair on that...</i>

pretty blonde head of yours.

How did you know
I was blonde?

Lucky guess, Goldilocks.

Yeah, a-a-anyway.

<i>Um, okay.</i>

Thank you for not going to the police.

<i>Oh, I'd never do that.
I expect the same.</i>

I don't understand.
Why would I go to the police?

'Cause now I got
something of yours.

Your boyfriend.

Are they gonna have sex
in the bathroom?

Bobby!

Bobby! Bobby!

Bobby!

Bobby, where are you?

Bobby, are you okay?

<i>He can't come to the phone right now.</i>

<i>He's a little... busy.</i>

Why are you doing this?

Only seems fair.

I told you we were sorry about the car.
We didn't think anybody was home!

<i>It's about more than just the car.</i>

Please don't hurt him.

Aw, too late for that now.

I'm begging you.

<i>You want to see him again?
Alive?</i>

Of course!

Then we got a long road ahead of us.

There's just a couple of things
I'm gonna need you to do for me.

He wants to talk
on some private station or something.

This is so fucked!
Totally fucked!

I mean, who is this freak?
Why would you leave your number?
Are you a complete idiot?

I didn't want anyone going to the police!

Just leave her alone, all right?
She was just being Mel.

How do we know this guy's for real? How do we
know he's not punking us like some sick joke?

Hello? Hello?
Is anybody out there?

<i>Hello? Is anybody there?</i>

<i>Goldilocks?</i>

Yes. Yes, I'm here.

Who are you?

<i>You can call me... Rusty Nail.</i>

Can I speak to Bobby?

Please? L-

I need to know that he's okay.

Oh, my God. Bobby! Bobby!

Okay. It's okay.

<i>You do what I asked?</i>

Yes.

<i>I got the cell phones.</i>

Line 'em up in front of the car.

No way! I waited two days
in line for this phone.

<i>Do it. Nowl</i>

No.
Move!

<i>- How's he gonna know if you do it or not?
He's probably watching us.</i>

How do you know he's watching us?
How do you know that?

Okay.

<i>Start the car and drive forward.</i>

<i>Don't do it, Melissal
Don't do it, Melissa.</i>

I have to.
If you do it now, he'll know
he can do anything he wants.

This is fucking insane!

Don't do it!

Fuck!

Okay, it's done.

You follow everything I say
to the letter.

You do that, I promise
you'll all be reunited soon.

Don't get no ideas of
separatin' or goin' for help.

<i>Okay.</i>

We'll do whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

Jesus. Make sure you tickle
his balls while you're at it.
Shut up, Nik!

What do you want?

Remember when your girlfriend
there threw her drink at my rig?

That was him? He's one of them.
He's a fucking trucker!

She gave me something,
right after that.

<i>Ring any bells?</i>

I don't understand.

<i>She gave me the finger.</i>

<i>Now I want it.</i>

<i>She gave it to me,
I figure it's mine to keep.</i>

What? My finger?

<i>I'll let you know
the place and the time.</i>

You just make sure
it's freshly cut.

<i>And if you don't show up, well...</i>

<i>things will not go well
for your boy here.</i>

And, Goldilocks?

Yes?

I want you to bring it to me.

<i>It's time we met...</i>

in the flesh.

I can't believe this is happening.

I swear to God,
we're gonna find him.

We can figure this out.
How smart can this guy be?
He said he had eyes everywhere.

That's impossible.

<i>I mean, he can use his C.B. to ask his fellow
road zombies if they've seen this car.</i>

I mean, it's pretty unique. It's probably
how they found us in the first place.

And he almost definitely has a police scanner,
so it means we can't go to the cops.

How do you know all this stuff?
Dad used to be a trucker.

Let's just say, not a fan.

<i>- He could be in any one of them.
It doesn't make sense for him to follow us...</i>

<i>until we meet him in...</i>

three hours, with
Kayla's severed finger.

We are not cutting off
my sister's finger.

My point is, is he's got to have something
to do between now and then.

Otherwise, he would've asked us
for it right then and there, right?

<i>- Okay.
So, if he's not following us now...</i>

and we stay away from trucks and police, maybe
we can find ourselves some time to maneuver.

He may be right.
Thank you.

What if he's wrong?
Hell, it's not my funeral.

Hey, you know what? Why would
you say something like that?

Sorry.
Just shut up!

You know what? Maybe we
should just get him what he wants.

I'm not going in there.
Nobody's asking you to.

<i>I'll go. You know
I can handle blood.</i>

No. You know what?
This is my fault.

I gotta do this.

I need you to come with me.
For what?

Wait.

Go wait with Mel.

Fuck.

What's with the whole
"okay with blood" thing?

Forget about it, all right?

No, seriously, you go to, like, med school,
or just a lot of P.M.S.

What part of"forget about it"
is confusing you?

Shit. Shit.

My God. Kayla. Kayla!
Oh, shit.

Shit.

Oh, God.

<i>Fuck, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.</i>

Thank God.

Did you get it?
Yeah.

I got a scalpel, too, just in case.

Great.
Let's go.

I'm in a fucking car
with a fucking finger.

Come on! Get in!
It's fantastic, really.

Oh, fuck! That's him!

That's the guy.
He wants his finger back! That's the guy.

<i>- He's coming for the fucking finger.
I don't have the keys.</i>

I left them right here! I
don't know where the keys are.
Let's go!

Come on, man!

You can't park here!
Police escort vehicles only!

How many times do I have tell you?

Sorry.
We're really sorry.

We did-
It'll never happen again.

<i>- Sir.
Yeah, sorry. Sorry, Mr. Lurch.</i>

<i>I'm not-I'm not so sure about this.</i>

<i>Relax. Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

Oh, great. Yeah, as long as we have the power
of positive thinking on our side.

I think this is it.

Stall him as long as you can.
Okay?

You be careful, okay?

Yeah.

<i>Okay, I'm here.</i>

Park about 50 feet away
from me, nose to nose.

What now?

<i>Get out of the car.</i>

<i>Then come around the front...</i>

and strip for me.

<i>Down to your underwear.</i>

<i>Gotta make sure you're not wearing
a weapon and a wire, now don't I?</i>

Please don't make me do this.

I'm not wearing anything.

I'm losing my patience.
Okay! Okay, okay.

I'll- I'll do whatever you say.

<i>At my signal,
come up to the cab...</i>

<i>and give me what's mine.</i>

And then you'll let Bobby go?

<i>You do what I say...</i>

<i>and I promise
you'll see him again.</i>

Do it now.

<i>And, Goldilocks?</i>

Make it slow.

<i>I want to enjoy this.</i>

<i>Now why don't you show me that
pretty little ring of yours?</i>

Oh, this is so messed up.
Just keep moving.

I don't remember reading
any of this shit on your user profile.

Are you serious? Just shut up!
I'm sorry.

L- I get nervous,
I tend to talk a lot.

Whoo-wee! That is the finest
striptease I ever did see!

I'm gonna throw this up
on YouTube, get me a million hits.

Who are you?
Whoever you want, sexy mama.

Close them pretty eyes and pretend
I'm Kenny Chesney for all I care.

Oh, my God.
You're not him?

Where's Bobby?
Bobby? What the high heck you talking about?

<i>All's I know is some road dawg came over the
squawk, told me that I'd get quite a show...</i>

if I pulled over
at this here chicken coop.

And, missy, let me tell you,
that did not disappoint one bit.

Bobby!
Bobby! Bobby!

Why are you doing this?
Goddamn it! Didn't warn me
you was no psycho she-bitch.

I'm out of here!

<i>Your titties
are too small anywaysl</i>

I like them super mongo jugs.

Yeah, you heard me.
Circus boobs!

What was that?

Roll!

I don't understand.
I did everything you asked!

<i>No, you didn't.</i>

I saw you down at the funeral parlor.
Mel, what is going on?

<i>There's a big difference between
a freshly cut, live finger...</i>

<i>and one snipped from a corpse.</i>

Less blood in that one
you got there.

Stiffer, paler.

<i>The nail's yellowed...</i>

<i>no nutrients, deterioratin'.</i>

Want to see what
a fresh one looks like?

Check the glove compartment.

Told you you'd see him again.

<i>I just didn't say
which part ofhim.</i>

<i>Your boy's losing a lot ofblood here.</i>

<i>Maybe I should take
care of that for him.</i>

No. No, no.

No!

What the fuck do you want?

We're not finished, Goldilocks.

<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

Heck of a joyride, isn't it?

<i>Okay. So, uh, maybe- maybe now
we should go to the cops.</i>

What are they gonna do?
Put out an all-points bulletin?

<i>Set up roadblocks?
Rull over every big rig in Utah?</i>

That's a damn good start.
He's monitoring the police bands.

He'll know the second we try to get help.
No. No police. Absolutely not.

What the fuck do you want to do then?
Whatever he asks!

Next time, for sure we do exactly
what he asks, no matter what it is.

This is so fucked up.

You alive, boy?

Don't do anything stupid.

<i>Just goin'out for a minute.</i>

Sorry, hoss, but you got to be a member
to enter a bar in Utah.

<i>#Singin'my song to you #</i>

All right. But be quick.

Dick.

# I don't have to change no more #

# No, I can't #

Help me! Help me!

# Singin' my song to you
ain't gonna pay my bills ##

Help!

Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about.

Help!

What the fuck?

<i>Helpl</i>

What's going on in there?

Help me!
Holy fuck!

Open the door!

Hey, you hold on in there, buddy.
I'll get you out of here.

<i>Damn thing, it won't openl</i>

No!
I can't open the damn door!

Oh, my God.

Did you see
the way his jaw dropped?

You like taking chances, huh?

Well, then I got a game for you.

Rusty, can you hear me?

<i>Rusty, please talk to me.</i>

<i>Rusty, please talk to me.</i>

<i>It's been over an hour. Maybe he's, um-</i>

Well, maybe it's over.
Maybe he's, you know, already dead.

Shut up, Nik.
So much cooler over the Internet.

Yeah, so were you.

<i>Goldilocks?</i>

Y- Yes, Rusty.
Rusty, I'm here.

<i>Look, I'm-I'm sorry...</i>

about what we did to you,
deceiving you like that.

<i>It won't happen again.
Just please-</i>

<i>please let me talk to Bobby.</i>

I'm tired. Real tired.

Been gone a long time.

<i>I was heading home, you know.</i>

Planning on staying
off the road for a while.

Hibernatin'.

<i>Like a bear, huh, Goldilocks?</i>

Rusty, please-

please let me talk to Bobby.

<i>I love him more than...</i>

<i>anything in the world.</i>

<i>And we're getting married.</i>

<i>Bobby, if you can hear me,
I love you.</i>

<i>I love you so much.</i>

<i>I need you to get something for me.</i>

Anything you want.

Some high-speed chicken feed.

I don't know what that is.
It's crank.

It's trucker speak
for crystal meth.

What, now we're drug mules?
Fuck!

We're just gonna do
whatever he says.

Yeah. You know what? I'm just glad
it doesn't involve a fucking body part!

<i>I think it's about time for y'all
to take a walk on the wild side.</i>

Get in.

<i>#It's 2:00 in the morning
My baby's in bed #</i>

<i>Not exactly my scene, but I respect
their right to peaceful assembly.</i>

Go, go, go, go, go!

Or not so peaceful.

All right, Rusty, we're here.

What now?

<i>Check the trunk.</i>

Fuck if I'm doing it.

What the hell?

<i>Did you get it, Goldilocks?</i>

What is this?

<i>Well, that's what the tattooed
boy's gonna wear.</i>

Oh, no fucking way.

<i>I want him to walk through this party...</i>

<i>Iookin'like
a disease-ridden lot lizard.</i>

<i>That's all us gacked-out,
speed-freak truckers can get...</i>

<i>so that's exactly what
he's gonna do for me.</i>

<i>Oh, my God. He was there.</i>

He heard everything. He was in the diner.
He heard everything you said!

Way to go, Tattooboy2000!
Shut up!

Take it easy, Finger Queen. You didn't exactly
ingratiate yourself to him either!

Shut up!

<i>You're a gambler, aren't you, boy?</i>

What's the odds you can stay out there
long enough to bring me what I want?

Zero! 'Cause it's not
fucking happening!

Want me to go out there
dressed like a fucking tranny?

They'll kill me.
Not doing it.

Oh, you're doing it.

I'm not doin' it.
Yes. You are.

<i>- Excuse me?
You're gonna go out there...</i>

<i>and you're gonna do everything
he asks to the letter...</i>

'cause Bobby's life
depends on it.

Fuck you.
Hey, know what, Nik?

<i>Fuck you too.
Most of all, fuck himl</i>

<i>Fuckl What the fuck are you doing, bitch?</i>

You are not going anywhere.

I don't even know why I stayed around this long.
I barely know you or your boyfriend.

And, you,
I'm sorry, but you're just not worth it.

<i>From now on, this is between
you guys and Rusty Dickhole.</i>

Good night and good luck.

<i>You're not gonna have to
worry about Rusty anymore, Nik...</i>

'cause right now
I'm your fucking problem.

<i>Mel? Mel.</i>

I am not gonna let you
jeopardize Bobby's life.

Mel, I think you have to calm down.

<i>Mel, give me the scalpel.</i>

I'm sorry.

I will do whatever
it takes to save him.

'Cause Bobby is worth it.

I can't go out there
dressed like a fucking tranny.

<i>I can't do that.
They'll kill me.</i>

Please don't make me do this.
I just want to go home. I just-

Please.

<i>- You're not much of a tough guy now, huh?
Please.</i>

All tattooed and pierced.

They're fake. Lookit.

<i>They're fucking fakel
They're fakel</i>

You're a little
fucking douche bag!

<i>Rlease. Rlease.</i>

<i>Listen to me, Nik.
We're going to make sure...</i>

that you pass as a girl.

<i>- Oh, that won't be a problem.
You're gonna go out there...</i>

<i>you're gonna get some speed from some dirt ball
too wasted to even know the difference...</i>

and everything's
gonna run smoothly, okay?

Okay.

Goldilocks, you out there?

<i>You better not bail on us.
'Cause I'll call you out on it so damn fast.</i>

I said I'd fucking do it!
Okay?

<i>How's my little hussy?</i>

We're just finishing
some final touches.

<i>#Monkey-doin'woman
Mr. Shy Guy's back in town #</i>

<i>#Monkey-doin'woman
Mr. Shy Guy's back in town #</i>

<i># Well, I'm a monkey-doin'man #</i>

We should follow him.

No. We can't leave this car.

He didn't say anything to us
about staying put this time, right?

I mean,
this could be a trap.

Hey! Come on over, sexy lady!

Hey, you want some of this, huh?

<i>- Does any-
You want a real man behind you?</i>

<i>- Does anybody have any meth?
You like it like that?</i>

<i>Rusty's here, Mel.</i>

<i>He is. A nd we have to
try to find out who he is...</i>

what his truck looks like, where he might be
keeping Bobby, something.

He said that if we followed
everything that he told us-

<i>He would reunite us.
Which really only means...</i>

if we keep following his demands,
we're all gonna end up dead.

Does anybody have any crystal?

Hey, sweet tits!
I got what you're lookin' for.

Maybe we can work somethin' out
in trade, huh?

I'm sorry. No- No, thanks.

Why are you
running away from me?

Fuck.

Oh, shit!
You can't-

Oh, my God! Shit!

Oh, my God!

Hey, little girl.

Nik! Nik!

No! Get back in the car!

<i>Back to the carl
We gotta chase himl</i>

That fuck head!
We can't follow him!

He's gonna kill Bobby,
and then he's gonna kill us!

This is our one chance.

<i>- He's taunting us.
Kayla, please.</i>

Where did he go?

I don't see him.

Oh, my God! Go!

Oh, my God!

Fuck!

What?

I can't- Okay.

I can't go any faster!

Oh, my God!

No!

Mel.

Mel, can you hear me?

<i>Mel?</i>

Oh, thank God.

I'm gonna-
I'm gonna get you out of here.

I'll get you out of here.

You have to wait until the last moment
to jump, okay?

What are you talking about?

If you time it right, he won't be able
to see you from this angle.

You have to go.

Oh, my God.

Go. Go. Come on. Get up.

Come on.

That's good.

Okay. I gotta
get you out of here.

Sis. Sis.

My leg's pinned.

I'm not going anywhere.

You have to go.
I'm not.

You have to go.
I'm not going.

Promise me you'll finish this.

I promise.

What the fuck's going on?
Where are we?

<i>Where it all started.</i>

<i>Where I can
take my time with you.</i>

<i>Couple ofbig-time risk takers, huh?</i>

Pl-Pl-Please let us go.

You like to gamble?

Like to take chances?

You like to steal cars?
It wasn't my idea!

Come on, please.
I'll do anything you want.

Nik, stop talking.
Anything, I mean it. Sky's the limit, man.

Shut up!

Stop talking.

What's your favorite game?

Or you prefer I complete your transformation?
No, no, no!

Stop, stop!

<i>I said,
what's your favorite game?</i>

Craps! Craps!

Good one. Nice odds.

I got my own favorite game.

You want to play?

You're up first.

What do you want me to do?
Roll!

<i>Five.</i>

<i>- Kneecap.
Fuck.</i>

No!

Your turn.

How do you want me
to do the other leg?

<i>Seven.</i>

Safe. Lucky you.

Again.

I don't want to play anymore.

I don't like repeating myself!

Ow!

They're-They're-
They're-They're fake. Sorry.

Roll.

<i>Four. Chest.</i>

What is he doing?

<i>- Oh, shit.
What is he doing?</i>

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

Help! Help!

Help!

<i>Come on, lover boy.
It's just a game.</i>

Stay with me now.

I can't do this.

Roll.

I said roll!

<i>Rlease, don't.</i>

Don't. Bobby, don't.

<i>Rlease, don't.</i>

Uh-oh. Double ones.

Somebody just crapped out.

What does that mean?

What does that mean?

Look familiar?
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

You wanted to use this
on me, didn't ya?

You were trying to kill us.

<i>Now, didn't you ever hear...</i>

two wrongs just
don't make a right?

Where are you?

Nik, look at me.

Help me.

Where the fuck are you?

Where is he?
Look at me.

Where is he? Please?

<i>I'm here. Don't you worry.</i>

Right behind you.

Well, there you go.

Just you and me now.
You're the only one left.

Oh, God, Melissa.

Yeah. She's dead too.

It's a damn shame.

I was having fun.

Why are you doing this?

I want you to feel what it's like to have
something taken away from you.

You took everything from me!

Not everything.

Not yet.

It was only a car.

It may get a little bouncy back here.

You be sure to hang on tight.

Don't go doing anything clever.

Son of a bitch!

Melissa!
Bobby?

<i>Melissal</i>

Bobby! Bobby, are you there?

<i>Melissa!</i>

Are you all right?
Shut the power to the trailer.

<i>- What?
Shut the power to the trailerl</i>

It's in the cab. Get the truck
and take us out of here.

<i>Bobbyl</i>

<i>Melissa, gol</i>

We need help. Is anyone there?
Send the police. Exit 57 West.

Where are you,
you son of bitch?

Goldilocks.

<i>Is it over?</i>

It is now.

<i>Shitl</i>

<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

Shit!

Of course.

Hey! Help!

Help!

Asshole.

My car won't start.

<i>Get in.</i>

<i>You'll catch your death out there.</i>
