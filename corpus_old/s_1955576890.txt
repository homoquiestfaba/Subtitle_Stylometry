This next property
is very well suited

to your particular
needs, Mr. Krakowski.

And as you can see it's
very conveniently located

for a young businessperson
like yourself, Mr. Krakowski.

[ Door closing ]

This house speaks to me.

Hear it?

Just a whisper.

Over and over

it says

potential!

Yes!

Potential!

Phew.

AGENT:
A little soap and water,

maybe a little paint,

and this place will look like
a brand-new home in no time.

[ Blowing nose ]

AGENT:
A home like this, Mr. Krakowski,

can be the foundation for
the rest of your life.

This area has a...
[ Door squeaking ]

Your buildings can
only go up in value.

I'm telling you, this
thing is a real deal.

[ Water dripping ]

Oh, did I mention the master
bedroom has its own closet?

[ Water running ]

[ Toilet flushing ]

[ Music playing ]

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Oh, no, I wasn't...
It's okay.

Well, what do you think?

GRAHAM:
Well, I... I don't know.

It isn't speaking to me.

I mean, it's not
saying exactly what...

You know, Mr.
Krakowski, Graham,

maybe I better just say it.

I'm attracted to you.

It's a physical
thing, I'll admit it.

I feel like, like I
wanna grab you by the...

Oh, oh.
[ Laughing ]

Wait a minute.

Look, I'm not this open
with every guy that comes along,

you know, I let my urges build.

Do you know what that means?

I'm ready for some good,
healthy sex with you,

right now, if possible
right here on this toilet!

I understand but
I have a girlfriend.

She's in Buffalo,
Graham, I'm right here!

Oh, okay, okay.

I'll take it.

Where first?
No, no, no, no.

The house, I'll buy it.
Huh?

It's talking, I
suddenly heard it.

It's screaming "potential".

Well, you're certainly a very
decisive man, Mr. Krakowski.

Thank you.

Can we go now?

Open that escrow?

Escrow?
Oh, yes.

Why, certainly.

This way.

I don't know, Graham.

Owning a house is okay
but you're gonna get

an ulcer making the payments.

No, Chuck, I figured
all this out months ago.

My salary and savings will cover
the monthlies to the penny,

right up until I get my
interim raise in January.

And if I get my promotion
to full analyst,

well, I could even think about
putting in a hot tub or

maybe even a lanai.

A lanai? Wow!

What if you get fired?

That's not an option, Chuck.
That's not even funny.

What happened?

I heard something.

Like a big something?
Or like a squirrel?

Like...

[ Sighing ]

Like maybe a big squirrel.

Graham, that bum isn't
coming back, alright?

And even if he does,

he's not getting passed
this new deadbolt.

Check it out.

[ Door rattling ]

Solid as Fort Knox.

Geez, you know,

it's amazing what a little
financial stress

can do to a guy.

Grahamski.
What?

Want me to spend the night?

No, don't be ridiculous.

Hey, hey, come on.

What?
You alright?

It's okay.
You alright?

I'm awake.

Jesus Christ, Krakowski.

It's alright, it's alright.
It's okay.

What the hell
was that all about?

I don't know, I...
I just...

felt like...
Huh? What are you...

You walking in your sleep? Huh?

Christ Almighty, man, you
scared the shit out of me.

This switch plate,
he left with this one?

It was a dream, I
know, but it was...

Graham. Graham. Graham!
Lt was so real.

Look, why don't you crawl back
to your nice little bed there?

Chain yourself to it
and go back to sleep?

Jesus.

I'm sorry I scared you.
CHUCK: Shut up.

911 OPERATOR:
911 emergency.

Hello. Emergency?

I'd like to report a
dangerous vagrant who is...

911 OPERATOR:
What is he doing, sir?

Doing?

You mean right now?

911 OPERATOR:
Yes, right now.

Well, he's just sitting
there eating something,

but two days ago he was...

911 OPERATOR:
Excuse me, can you hold, please?

Yes, I'll hold.

[ Hold music playing ]

You're the complainant?

GRAHAM:
Yes, I called.

He's over there in the
bushes under that billboard.

Who?

The vagrant.

I found him in my
house on Thursday.

This is my house right here.

Did he remove any articles?

Well...

Then what seems
to be the problem?

GRAHAM:
Well, the problem is

there's something really
wrong with this guy.

I mean, you can see it in
his eyes, something vile,

and he was eating this...

I don't know what it was, this
disgusting piece of rotten...

Sir, we cannot
apprehend a citizen

on the basis of what he eats.

Read the Constitution.

I understand, but there
must be trespassing laws.

I mean, the guy's
living over there.

He cooks on an open fire
in an undesignated area

and he's using the
bushes to urinate and...

You've seen him urinating?

Well...

OFFICER: Be honest.
Well...

No, I haven't actually
seen him, but, my God,

if you smelled those bushes.

Circumstantial, you got no case.

No, wait, Buzz.

If we can find a
corroborating witness

we could make the
urination stick.

Yes?

I'm officer Schatz, this is
my partner Officer Lincoln.

You'll have to talk into my aid.

[ High-pitched whine ]

Ma'am, what is
your name, please?

Mrs. Harry B. Howler,
except Harry's been dead.

Ma'am, have you witnessed a man

urinating in those
bushes over there?

Urinating?

Well, he better hadn't
urinate back there.

He's over there right now.

Quick, I think he's
getting ready to urinate.

Should I call a backup?
No time, no time!

Well, you're the new
neighbor fellow, aren't you?

Won't you come in and have
a nice glass of lemonade?

Maybe some other time.

OFFICER:
Alright, buddy, come with us.

No trouble now.

MRS. HOWLER: He's the one that's
been urinating back there?

Ah! Ah!

[ Growl ]

OFFICER 2: Get him in the back
and read him his rights!

[ Music playing ]

[ Keyboard clacking ]

Krakowski.

Where's that stress-failure
analysis I asked for?

Right here, sir.

How'd you like to
see yourself promoted

to full analyst, Krakowski?

Well, Mr. Feemster, I
certainly wouldn't mind that.

And how'd you like
to see yourself fired

right this very minute?

I...

I wouldn't like
that at all, sir.

Good.

Because I have no
intention of doing it.

[ Laughing ]

You're a good man, Krakowski.

You do your job
and dress neatly.

Why, thank you, sir.

Don't you suck up to me.

Nobody likes an ass kisser.

Yes, sir.

[ Crickets chirping ]

[ Chopping ]

"I'm really looking forward

"to spending my vacation
days with you, Graham.

"How's the new
house coming along?

"I can't wait to see it.

"It's flight number
12 on Monday the 10th,

"arriving 8:30 p.m., but I'll
be talking to you before then.

"Yours truly,
sincerely, best wishes

"and possibly the
'L' word, Edie."

[ Music playing ]

Oh, no.

I don't believe it.

[ Music playing ]

Dammit, he's cooking.

Oh.

Oh, that's it. That's it.

That's it. That's it.

[ Phone ringing through ]

911 OPERATOR:
911 emergency. Can I help you?

I wanna report a vagrant
who's gotten out of jail.

You arrested him yesterday
and now he's right there...

911 OPERATOR:
Excuse me, sir, can you hold?

But this is a...

[ Hold music playing ]
Oh, for Pete's sake.

Ah!
Ah!

911 OPERATOR:
Hello, is anybody there?

Ah! Ah! Ah!

911 OPERATOR: Sir, are you there?

Yes, he is out there.
Send someone immediately!

911 OPERATOR: Sir, are you
there? Is anybody there?

Yes, I'm here, I'm here.

Ah! Ah! Ah!

Whoa!

[ Music playing ]

911 OPERATOR:
911 emergency. Can I help you?

Yeah.

He...

[ Siren wailing ]

And the infrared detectors
will turn these floodlights on

if anybody comes within 20 feet,

sounding an alarm
next to my bed.

In case the
garage door's locked,

there's another set of controls,
so nobody can break in...

Graham, how are you
paying for all of this?

What?

How are you paying
for all of this?

I'm taking out
a second mortgage.

Oh, that's great.

Oh, you know, you are digging
yourself into a hole so deep

that you're never gonna get out.

You know, and this is all
because of some festering

pocket of paranoia in
that bony skull of yours.

Paranoia?

Oh, no, Chuck, crime
statistics are real,

I've done the research.

Crime statistics? What
are you talking about?

Come over here, I
wanna show you something.

What are you
talking about, Graham?

Hey, hey. Chill out a
little here, will you?

He ordered the deluxe system.

Didn't you sell me a
leaky roof five years ago?

No. No.
Yes, you did.

I tried to sue you.
No, it wasn't me.

I just have one of those
common faces, you know?

[ Metal clanking ]

GRAHAM:
This way, Chuck. Over here.

Chuck!

I swear he runs his
life well for a vagrant.

He leaves in the morning
just before I go to work.

He comes home about
a quarter after six.

Maybe 10 after.

I tried to follow him one
day just to see where he goes

but I lost him.

God, he's disgusting, Chuck.

I mean filthy.

He's got this mangled
eye and the sick smile,

like he's deranged

or had some kind of a
head injury or something.

Grahamski.

This arm, it hangs
kind of limp and puffy.

This weird walk.

The guy is some hard luck case

who's sleeping here
for a few days.

Just leave him
alone, he'll move on.

GRAHAM: Oh, no, I don't
believe that for a minute.

He's clever and he's dangerous.

I can see it in his eyes.

It's always those quiet types

that end up being the
most violent, you know?

ALARM MAN: I need to get
that check now!

Be right there!

Say what you will, Chuck.

I'm protecting myself.

Paranoia. Yeah.

Wow.

EDIE:
Graham, this is so exciting.

GRAHAM:
Well, we're almost there.

EDIE: Yeah?
GRAHAM: Yeah.

EDIE: Okay, let me guess
which house it is, okay?

Don't tell me which one
it is, let me guess.

GRAHAM: Okay.
EDIE: Okay.

[ Beeping ]

Wow!

Graham, this is...

This is... really... bright.

[ Chuckling ]

[ Music playing ]

[ Music becomes louder ]

The guy who used to live here
must have been really paranoid.

It's automatic.

The music.

Makes them think
somebody's at home.

Them?

Well, you know.

Undesirables.

Oh. Ls...
is this a bad area?

Oh, no, no, no, no.

Well, you can't be too
careful these days.

Ooh.
Oh, Graham.

They, uh, they left the
furniture too, huh?

Yeah.

Well, it's...
you see, I was...

Graham, you were
waiting for me to help you

pick out the
furniture, weren't you?

Yes.

I mean, no.
I mean, uh...

you don't wanna spend your
vacation furniture-shopping.

No, I don't mind.
You don't?

No.

I mean, it will be fun,
we'll do it together.

We'll get new furniture
and... and, uh, drapes

and carpet, and, uh, lamps.

Hmm, lamps.

Wallpaper.
Everything.

Well, that sounds great.

But, you know, I'm on a bit
of a budget right now, so.

But you have credit
cards, don't you?

[ Chuckling ]

It'll be fun.

We'll coordinate
the whole house.

Sure.

Whatever.

Whatever you wanna do.

[ Music playing ]

[ Dripping echoing ]

[ Wheezing ]

[ Chuckling ]

[ Music playing ]

No.

Ah!

GRAHAM: Where is it?

I know it's in here.

It's gotta be in here.

Where is it?

EDIE:
Graham, what are you doing?

There's a trap door
in here somewhere.

EDIE: What?

I've gotta find it.

There's gotta be
another way in here.

Graham.
I've seen it.

There is no trap door in here.

Were you sleepwalking?

Yes.

[ Chuckling ]
Yes.

Look, Edie, I should
have warned you.

Sometimes I talk in my sleep.

Talk?

And walk, a little.

Oh.

Graham, you're a crazy guy.

But I'm glad you woke us up.

[ Moaning ]

WOMAN: Look out, here
comes Mr. Feemster.

MR. FEEMSTER:
Well, well, well, well.

Hello there, young Krakowski.

Are you keeping busy
these days, Krakowski?

Yes, sir, Mr. Feemster.
Very busy indeed, sir.

MR. FEEMSTER:
Oh, good.

Graham, Krakowski,
I want you to meet

a very important new friend
of the company, Mr. Polkowisz.

It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

Krakowski, is it?
Oh, yes.

Krakowski here is one of our
finest young employees, Karl.

A hard worker of
Czechoslovakian extraction.

Hey, just like yourself.

Fine, fine, good to see it.

Well, it's only my
grandfather on my mother's side.

I'm not technically...

Mr. Polkowisz and I
are coming very close

to a very big deal, Krakowski.

Very big.

Closer all the time, BF.

Karl, you just reminded me.

I was planning on promoting
young Krakowski here

to full analyst right
this very afternoon.

Sir!

Krakowski, take the
rest of the day off.

Mr. Feemster!

[ Speaking Czechoslovakian ]

Come on, talk some
of that Czech shit.

Talk the Czech shit.

[ Speaking Czechoslovakian ]

Well, "adios"!
[ Laughing ]

Come on, Karl...

So, what did he say?

He said, "Wash your hands
after you go to the bathroom".

She's gonna love 'em.

[ Music playing ]

[ Indistinct chatter ]

WOMAN: Come on, back
it up, back it up.

MAN:
Have you talked to her?

[ Indistinct chatter ]

WOMAN: They said it was a woman,
transsexual prostitute, I heard.

MAN:
Let's move back. Get away.

Oh, God.

[ High-pitched whine ]

GRAHAM:
Mrs. Howler.

Mrs. Howler!

Edie!
Oh, Christ.

[ Music playing ]

Goddamn it!

[ Chip crunching ]

Boo!

[ Screaming ]

[ Laughing ]

[ Music playing ]

Ah!
Ah!

Jesus, Graham, you
scared me to death!

Thank God you're safe.

He got in the house somehow,
he's in the kitchen right now.

What are you talking about?

Mrs. Howler's been murdered.

There's this vagrant who
lives across the street,

he did it, I know it, and
now he's in the kitchen.

EDIE:
Graham, calm down.

The man in the kitchen is
just a poor homeless person.

He was digging in the
garbage cans for food.

What?

EDIE: I invited him
in for a sandwich.

You invited him in here?

And you're taking a shower
without any clothes on?

Are you nuts?

EDIE:
No, Graham, I'm not.

Christ, how could you?

I spent a fortune on
lawns and boards,

and you just let
him walk in here?

You know, I don't know
what your problem is

but that man in the
kitchen is not a murderer.

GRAHAM:
He is, Edie! He is!

How could you be so stupid?

You know, you're
acting like a maniac.

Now, get out of the bathroom.

But I...

Wait, lock the door.

[ Phone dialing ]

[ Phone ringing through ]
[ Music box tune playing ]

911 OPERATOR:
911 emergency.

What is it now,
Mr. Krakowski?

[ Music box tune playing ]
[ Bicycle bell ringing ]

Barfuss.

GRAHAM: Sorry?

Lieutenant Ralf Barfuss.

Homicide.
GRAHAM: Thank God. Come in.

He was right in here.

Sitting right in that
chair, eating a sandwich.

I'm sure there are fingerprints,
I haven't touched anything.

You say he was
eating a sandwich?

Look, my girlfriend was naive
enough to let this guy in,

but the point is he's the
killer, he murdered Mrs. Howler.

The lady they found dead
across the street.

Now, what was your
name again, sir?

Graham Krakowski.

"K-R-A-K-O-W-S-K-I".

Okay, now, Mr. Karlofski,

what kind of sandwich was
this alleged man eating?

Lieutenant, we're talking
about a murder here!

Hey, I got your debt,
twinkle-toes.

You think I don't know
what's going on here?

I know exactly what's
going on everywhere.

Edie, please.

What?

I'd like to keep
her out of this.

Who?

My friend Edie.

What about her?

She's standing right behind you.

[ Laughing ]

Ma'am.

Now, ma'am.

What's your side of this?

EDIE:
My side of this is that Graham

is making paranoid accusations.

Edie!

That man was just a poor soul

that I invited in
for a sandwich.

He was down on his luck.

Maybe he was a little
mentally retarded

but he wouldn't hurt a fly.

Do you really think that I
would let somebody in this house

if I thought they were
the least bit dangerous?

She's got a point, Krakowski.

Look,

all I know is I've had
this feeling in my bones

about this guy since
the first day I saw him,

that he was evil and violent.

I'm sorry, I can't put
it any better than that.

What are those flowers
doing on the floor?

Hmm?

They were for you, Edie.

To celebrate my promotion
to full analyst.

I wish none of this
had ever happened.

ANCHOR:
A bizarre, senseless

and likely to be
sensationalized murder

took place last night.

The body of its victim, Mrs.
Harry Pa. Howler, a widow,

was found in this
sour-smelling garbage container

behind Sweeney's Buffet
in Slack more Flats

just after 3:00 p.m.

Authorities describe
the murder as "bizarre,

one of the sickest
things ever seen".

A late breaking development
in this bizarre case.

The county coroner's
autopsy report

contains a startling detail.

It said quite
simply, and I quote,

"The victim's eight
fingers and two thumbs

have been severed
from the body".

Oh, my God.

ANCHOR: Police sources indicate
that those fingers and thumbs

have not been
located at this time.

The coroner's report added
that the victim had not,

repeat, had not been
sexually molested.

Dixie?

We'll have sports and
weather after this.

I'm sorry I yelled at you, Edie.

I don't know what came over me.

[ Music playing ]

[ Dripping echoing ]

[ Metal coils squeaking ]

[ Laughing ]

EDIE: Graham?

[ Groaning ]

EDIE: Graham?

Graham?

I'm with you, Graham.

I'm behind you 100% on this.

I think you're a terrific person

and I know that
with the right kind

of support and understanding
that you're really gonna

be able to pull
yourself through this.

[ Sighing ]

So...

Good luck.

[ Car engine starting ]

[ Thunder rumbling ]

Paranoia, Chuck.
Pure paranoia.

Remember that night
you stayed at my house?

Yeah.

I walked in my sleep, right?

Yeah, you just
about strangled me.

GRAHAM:
Chuck, every morning

I find a pair of pants
in the oven,

books in the shower, food
eaten, urine in the blender.

I can't sleep at night for
fear of what I might do next.

What about that guy,
you know, the vagrant?

Is he still around?

No, Chuck, forget about him.

I haven't seen
him since that day

Edie gave him the sandwich.
It's me.

That bum was just the
screen onto which I projected

my own unacceptable
desires and actions.

Poor Mrs. Howler is
dead and buried now.

And the police are right,

anyone could have killed her.
Anyone, Chuck.

Even me.

What?

I'm saying I could
have done it in my sleep.

Graham, look, I...

Your plate, sir?
Yeah, please. Thanks.

Look, Graham, you know, I think
it's time that you start to,

you know, seek some
professional counseling.

Okay, look, I'm gonna get you
Brianna's cousin's number.

He just opened up
an office and...

No!

My God, if it's true,

and some shrink figured
it out and called the police?

Graham, let go.

I mean, what if the authorities

actually found out I killed her?

[ Plates shattering ]

Oh, I'm sorry.

Let's get out of here right now.

For God sakes, Graham.

And how is
everything, gentlemen?

Can I see the dessert menu?

[ Music playing ]

"In the darkness of every spirit

"lies the beast, fully capable
of uncontrolled action.

"Fear is the key that unlocks
the gate and frees the beast.

liberator of the beast."

WOMAN:
Hello? Hello? Graham?

Graham, do you know
what time it is?

GRAHAM: Yes.

What?

WOMAN:
This is 10:00!

Ten o' clock?
WOMAN: Yes!

Mr. Feemster is furious,
do you know...

Oh, no.

Yes, Mrs. Stevens, tell him
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

What? Mr. Feemster
is very angry?

MRS. STEVENS: Yeah!
Yes, I'm sure he is.

Yes, yes, thank you.

Hey, fellows.
Hey, come on, guys,

isn't there something
you should be doing here?

Let's get busy.

Coming through.

I knew it all along.

I knew it, I knew
I wasn't crazy.

The guy's been in my basement,
Chuck, the whole time

doing all these things to me.

You just relax, don't do...

The police are taking
care of everything.

Bad odor, Krowski.

You smell it?

Of course, it's awful.

It's rotten flesh. The
old lady's fingers.

You trying to tell me
you didn't smell that

until this morning?

Well, maybe a little but
I thought it was a dead rat.

You see, I put poison
downstairs last week and I...

Rats?

Yes.

How long are you gonna let
dead rats stink up your house

before you do
something about it?

Wait a minute.

What the hell have dead rats
got to do with a homicidal

vagrant breaking into
my friend's basement?

BARFUSS:
Hey! You, come here.

Over here.

You've got something
to say, wise guy?

CHUCK: No, sir.

BARFUSS: You ever seen this
alleged vagrant?

CHUCK: No.

But I believe Graham
when he says he has.

BARFUSS: Well, you're probably
the only one that does.

about the house.

I guess I should
have called first.

How did you get in?

The gate. It was open.

Do you hunt?

What?

No, no, I...

I've had financial problems.

That's why I wanna
sell the house.

Well, if you don't mind
the late hour, Graham, I'd...

I'd like to come in and
tell you how much I'd like

to handle your property.

What could you possibly
say, Krowski?

[ Babbling ]

Oh, yeah?

What about Judy Dansig,
the real estate lady?

We got a call to check the same
dumpster across the street,

only this time, we
found Judy Dansig.

Almost all of her.

Oh, no.

Oh, yeah.

GRAHAM: He's real.

He got in here
last night somehow.

He, he, he, he, he...

He... he wrote this.

[ Guns cocking ]

It's okay, boys.

It's written in blood.

He wrote it and...
and then he killed her.

Don't you see? He's crazy.
That... that vagrant did it.

What, do I look stupid
to you, Krowski?

What about...
LACKSON: Lieutenant!

Lieutenant!

In there.

I think it's everything.

[ Music playing ]

[ Groaning ]

I always knew you were good
for a promotion, Krowski.

Get back! Move
aside! Move aside!

REPORTERS:
Graham! Graham!

Get back! Move aside!

Get back, please!

Graham! Graham.
I talked to Mr. Feemster.

He said everything's
gonna be okay.

The company hired
the best lawyers

and you're gonna be
out by tonight.

You're looking good, buddy.

[ Music playing ]

OFFICER:
Turn and look at the clock.

Huh?

OFFICER:
Turn and look at the clock.

The other way!

Geez.

I like you, Krakowski.

I always have.

Mr. Feemster.

There will be no
attorney coming, Krakowski.

But I'm innocent.

I'm sorry, Krakowski.

I really am.

Everything.

Gone.

[ Gavel pounding ]

PROSECUTOR: Prosecution calls
Mrs. Miriam Francis Krakowski.

In cases such as these,

with men such as Mr. Krakowski,

it is vital that we understand

the defendant's
psychological underpinnings,

his basic urges, if you will.

Boy, this guy is really good.

Is it not true that
on July 27th of 1963

your son, Graham, did violently
assault

one Sarah Louise Bartlett

causing her to suffer a
bruised arm, related injuries

and require hospitalization?

MRS. KRAKOWSKI:
Well, yes, but that was...

PROSECUTOR:
Thank you, Mrs. Krakowski.

There will be no
further questions.

MRS. KRAKOWSKI:
They were children playing.

They were four years old.

PROSECUTOR: No further
questions, your honor.

No further questions?

My son may be put to death...

Mrs. Krakowski,
your out of order.

MRS. KRAKOWSKI: And you're not
gonna ask me anything else?

He's innocent, I
tell you! Innocent!

Oh!

[Audience gasping ]

Mom! No!

No! Let me go!

I gotta go! It's my mother!

That's my mother!

I gotta help my mother!

That poor, poor boy!

REPORTER:
Are we on?

Okay, let's go.

The press is having a field day.

Just moments ago,
after the tragic death

of his mother on
the witness stand,

the jury handed "Dumper
Dumpster" murder suspect,

Graham T. Krakowski, a verdict
of not guilty on all charges.

I repeat, not guilty.

Controversy abounds.

Stay with us,
we'll be right here

with live reenactment
on the hour.

Wait a min...
Greg, they're coming out now.

Yes, here comes the
late Mrs. Krakowski now.

Alongside her son Graham.

Oh, my God!

Oh, I don't believe that.

Oh, this poor man,
ladies and gentlemen,

one thing after another.

Ladies and gentlemen,
you have seen it first

on this television station.
Again, I don't believe this.

Not guilty my ass.

That pinko pussy jury went soft

when the son-of-a-bitch's
old lady bought it.

Now he's back out on the street,

and where do you think
the axe is gonna fall?

On your head, sir.

GRAHAM: Excuse me,

the sign out here says
you need a manager?

What you say?

GRAHAM:
The sign on your door,

it says that you're
looking for a manager.

And, well, if you're
still looking for one, uh,

I'd like to apply for the job.

Alright, come on in.

[ Groaning ]

Well, it ain't hard
to see I'm blind.

Well, no, sir.
But you seem to get around okay.

[ Laughing ]

You're goddamn right, son.

I do just fine by myself.

Now, you try some
shit, I'll show you.

See, this here is a
little old bitty trailer

and I'm bound to hit
something, specially your ass.

[ Laughing ]

I don't want no trouble, mister.

BLIND MAN:
What you running from?

Goddamn it, nobody stop
by a place like this

unless they running
from somethin'.

Now, what you're running from?

A woman?

Yes, a woman.

[ Laughing ]

I knew it. I knew it.

Ain't no crime in that.

So, uh, what's your name?

Kramer.

Jerry Kramer.

[ Laughing ]

Jerry Kramer, huh?

Well, Jerry Kramer,
my name is Ray.

They call me X-Ray 'cause
I'm blind.

[ Laughing ]

And this here is my baby,
my seeing eye dog.

Crystal, eh.

Do you still need a manager,
Ray?

I've got...

Well, I had management
experience and,

well, I'm kind of looking
for a place to settle down.

[ Kids playing in distance ]

WOMAN:
Yoohoo!

Oh!

WOMAN: Oh, careful.

You okay?

Yeah, yeah.

No problem.

Hi.

I live next door in number 14.

My name's Doattie.

Well, it's good to meet you.

It's good to meet
you too, Jerry.

X-Ray says you're
the new manager.

I guess I am.

Well, it sure is nice
to have you.

[ Chuckling ]

Nice young man like you.

I brought you a housewarmin'.

I call it Caribbean Delight.

Ooh!
Would you look at that!

It's coconut.

Mmm!

It's all for you.

Well, okay.

Well, if you need anything
you just give me a holler.

I will.

I'm right next door.

Oh, I know you are.

Bye-bye now.

Bye, Dotty.

Oh, it's Doattie.

Doattie, Doattie.

Bye, Jerry.

And you're quite
welcome about the cake.

Bye-bye, honey.
Bye.

Oh, God.

ANNOUNCER: On the most

GRAHAM: Doattie!

Hi!

Doattie, I need your
help. Will you help me?

Jerry, you're bleeding.

I know.
Will you do something for me?

Of course I will,
honey. What happened?

Just come over and I'll explain.

There's this man, Doattie.

He follows me or at
least I think he does.

And it makes me crazy.

I don't wanna do
anything bad at night.

Look.

I'll do this every night, okay?

And I want you to take the key

so you can unlock
me every morning.

Just lie back, Jerry.

Will you do that for me?

[ Sighing ]

Don't you worry, Jerry.

Don't you worry about
any little thing.

Oh, good.

It's not often I get a nice
young man like you to talk to.

You don't?
Mm-mmm.

And it gets lonely
nights, Jerry.

And them broken kids, they make
fun of me 'cause I'm heavy.

They do?
Uh-huh.

So I stay inside and
I watch TV and I cook.

[ Giggling ]

Oh, yeah?

And sometimes I drink.

[ Laughing ]

But now I got someone to
talk to and to take care of.

You, Jerry.

Me?
Mm-hmm.

And you want me too, don't
you, Jerry?

[ Chuckling ]

I can tell you do.
Whoa!

Go...

I just remembered.

X-Ray!

Don't be bashful, Jerry.

[ Chuckling ]

Mmm, I'll make you so happy.

[ Chuckling ]

Oh, Jerry, I sure
wanna thank you.

I mean, people have
been telling me

about the mighty fine job
you're doing 'round here.

Mighty fine, son.

Say, man,

how has Doattie been
treating you? Good?

Yeah.

[ Laughing ]

No complaints.

[ Laughing ]

None from her either!

[ Laughing ]

Well, there's one little one.

Son, she don't wanna
hurt your feelings none,

but she told me
that she was getting

mighty tired of
buying new underwear.

What?

Wait a second...

She wants me to buy
her new underwear?

[ Laughing ]

X-RAY: No, no.

She wants you to keep
your hands off the old ones.

In what way?

Well, she said she
was getting mighty tired

of waking up every morning

and finding a pair of
her draws in the kitchen

with a big ol' hole
cut down the middle.

Now, look...

I know that each man got
his own special thing.

Hell, I'm a man myself.

So, so why don't you
send off for a pair of them

real frilly drawers

that already got the
split down the middle?

But I...

Enough said. It ain't my
goddamn business anyway, okay?

And, uh...

She said she don't
want these no more.

I'll be right back.

Oh, goddamn.

Oh, Jerry. Sweet Jesus,
what have you done?

It wasn't me, it was him!

WOMAN:
He's right there!

Oh, Jerry. Why? Why?

Not again!

Not this time!

This time I'm gonna kill him!

No! No, Jerry!
No more killing!

I'm gonna kill him!

Huh?

Mrs. Howler!

Did I ever show you our
wedding rings, me and Harry's?

It's a diamond.

Ah! Ah!

You're such a nice young man.

I can't imagine how any
old police would think

you had anything
to do with this.

Ah!

JUDY:

What?

Sir, 500 miles out
of our jurisdiction.

Results, Lackson.

Nothing cuts through red
tape like results.

That section is for truckers.

We're truckers.

Sure.

It means licensed truckers.

Look, shut your flaps,
get your ass in gear,

and roll us out a couple

Sure.

Oh, yes, you are, Graham.

Bingo.

Now, calm down, Grahammy.

You should be grateful to me.

Before I met you, you were
a little boring neurotic.

You had boring friends,
a boring job, boring clothes,

a boring little
bitch girlfriend.

You did what they all told you.

And now you can
think for yourself.

You have your own mind.

You have your own life.

Look at you, you got
style, you're interesting,

and you're a celebrity.

I kind of like you.

You're a real piece of work.

I can't thank you

Wanted for murder
in eight states.

There's a reward
in five of them.

Right down here.

Wrapped up in a
nice little bundle.

Ah, don't worry about him.

Doc says he's not even gonna
make it to the hospital.

[ Wheezing ]

Well, that about wraps it up.

Isn't it gorgeous?

It's perfect.

Here are your two sets of keys.

Thank you.
