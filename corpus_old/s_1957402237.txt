Come out, my child...

Don't fear us. We only want to help you.

Help you ease your pain.

I can smell you. And so can my sister...

Child. Please.

Hello, my child...

Come out and make us proud... won't you?

You cannot escape him...

It is your fate.

Please... please!

Help me!

Life begins in pain...

Pain is necessary...

He is coming...

Rejoice!

For you are truly blessed!

Please... help me.

Who are you?

What are you doing here?

Not by the ears, Amalia. Remember?

Sorry, Papa.

Who are they?

Friends of Karl.

Karl... the one who died?

Go fetch our meat.

Good shot, Papa.

Well done, my girl.

The eye of the hunter
must always be open...

...looking for opportunity,
looking for danger...

...for prey or predator.

Are you watching closely, Little Bird?

You must eat!

It is our way.

The only way!

Go and help them.

Like little rabbits.

Always like scared, little rabbits.

Barbaric...

and crude.

They deserved more.

The old man is gone.

There is only... these two.

This one...

She is his blood.

A promise fulfilled.

Come now, child.

This is good for you.

Now the male.

The monster.

Papa, where are we?

Do you know this symbol?

My client.

What is this?

What is happening?

The time has come!

The first blood...

...we usher in the new hunt.

It is done.

His time has come.

The three of us welcome him.

The solstice has come.

The hunt has begun.

Bring him to the hut.

What the fucking hell is this?

We are servants.

Servants of the hunter.

Unchain his quarry.

Run.

Run! Run!

Run.

You're welcome.

At last!

They used to cut down trees here.

These trees, the forest...

...will remember you.

We will make sure of that.

I kept her safe. I helped hide her.

Well done, my girl.

And this!

Stay here! Hide!

The blood of the kills.

We shall consume it to share his power.

And adorn this holy ground
with its essence.

With this blood...

...we consecrate and confirm
our alliance to our lord of the land.

...to the god of the hunt.

...to the master of all nature.

The chapel is blessed.

We ready ourselves to welcome him home.

The feast shall be great this season.

Many wonderful flavors
provided by the lord of providers.

Oh, yes...

We shall be rewarded.

Hunter. Not hunted.

You were...

...his entire world...

and he gave his life...

so that you...

...could survive.

Hunter. Not hunted.

You too.

Remember your faith.

So devout, yet so restless.

You know her...

She should be accustomed...

...after all this time.

That's a matter of perspective.

You think it will end?

What?

This. The world. The land.

Him.

Do you think, one day,
it will all be gone?

As will we?

One day, we will be gone?

Like our sisters before us.

And the ones before them.

But the earth?

Our lord?

No.

He will abide.

And our sisters will oblige him.

Until the end of time?

The thing that has been
is that which shall be...

...and that which is done
is what shall be done.

And the circle shall not be broken.

Death traps.

Shit.

Polaris.

Karl died.

I miss papa.

You let her go, you big asshole!

We three, your devout servants,
sisters of the glen...

...hail your victory and your presence
in this, your holy temple!

Such devotion pleases me.

You!

Fetch me my weapon.

Bring her.

Willful child.

I honor your spirit.

And your survival.

But there can be
but one survivor here tonight.

And this little bird's grandfather...

...ensured it would be her.

Quiet, Grimur.

Reality is cruel.

Pain is necessary.

She was your friend?

Yeah?

She is my friend.

Prepare this one for the feast.

Give me the knife.

My lord...

I birthed you... help me.

I beg of you...

I have been born many times, my servant.

Your reward is your service.

Now die with your dignity.

Please...

Spare me...

I have served you.

I am Cernunnos!

Master of these woods.

Your lord and master.

It is the way of nature
for death to precede new life.

One has come to take your place.

It is your time.

Run! Live!

I'm nobody's servant.

He spared you.

My beauty is gone.

As are my sisters.

But it matters not.

I have more.

Many more.

Everything that ends begins again.

The thing that has been
is that which shall be,

and that which is done is
that which shall be done.

It is the way of nature, no?

What will you do
with the life he has given you?

Live.

Dear God... what happened to her?

She's alive, but weak.

Where could she have come from?

Are you alright? Can you hear me?

What happened to you?

He let me go.

Who? Who let you go?
