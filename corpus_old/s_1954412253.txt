We should prepare ourselves, 

305 
I have Rocco and Sassy sent, 

306 
Tongues will cut it down, he is 
big, but he is not a killer, 

307 
He never had a reason to, 

308 
People do not change, Darling, 

309 
Oh Sam, but they do, 

310 
People can not 
change for the better, 

311 
but they can for 
Change bad, 

312 
He does not care whether he is caught, 

313 
He does not care whether he re-
going to jail, 

314 
He goes there solely 
just that you pay, 

315 
I was not alone to blame, you bitch, 
Yes, you were, 

316 
Now I need some good news 
Was he there? Is he dead? 

317 
He is there, He is wounded, 
but still alive, 

318 
Are you kidding me? where is 
Tongues? Where is my order?

Sam's brother was released early, 

333 
Who the hell is Sam's brother? 
His name is Falcon, That was before our time, 

334 
And where is the damn problem? 
The guy was Sam Bat,

336 
See you here just once, 
Husband, We have a dozen 

337 
genuine killer on the payroll, 
When the brother 

338 
can rot in jail and 
Meanwhile hands around his wife 

339 
could be paranoid, 
Maybe, yes, 

340 
The point is:I do not care, 
how pissed Falcon is, 

341 
Anger does not make one bulletproof, 

342 
Hey, boss, 

343 
Oha! Hey, hey, wait! 

344 
Have times better have a damn 
good reason to show up here,

349 
Then it stop, but 
John, I'm not ,,,

For something you can not force yourself, 

374 
Either it is or non-
and for me it is so, 

375 
Such a statement is really stupid, man, 

376 
Why? 

377 
Because you then lonely 
'll end up, broke and 

378 
sometime then dead, 

379 
You think you're something better, right? 

380 
Yes, you think you're 
better than anyone else, 

381 
Not at all,

388 
If the fucker comes through the door,

431 
Hey, 

432 
Why? 

433 
We were brothers, 
We are still brothers, John, 

434 
What are you doing? 

435 
The pain is more 
than the balls, John, 

436 
Over the knife more than my 
falling damn levels, 

437 
Takes you just to the end, 
what it started, 

438 
What the hell are you talking about? 

439 
Tell 'him, 

440 
I wanted to marry you, John, 

441 
But I wanted to fuck Sam, 

442 
Not that! 

443 
Listen, John, Yes, it was a time 
because we were both happy, 

444 
You were happy, I was happy, you 
were married and I fucked her, 

445 
It was great! But seriously, John, 

446 
they never loved one of 
us so much like this, 

447 
Tell him the rest, 

448 
Triple murder! 
Chill out! 

449 
I will not go down! 
Chill out! 

450 
Fuck! 
No, we wanted to take everything! 

451 
You fucking psychopath! 
I've had enough now! 

452 
Stop looking at me like that, 

453 
What do you want from me? 

454 
I never told you, 
I love you! 

455 
Have you never promised that I 
will make no more party, 

456 
So stand 'around here not so, 
like you're something better, 

457 
Whoa, wait, wait, wait! You want revenge, 
I understand, I understand, yes, 

458 
But not like this, Let's do it the way 
it's your and my daddy did before, 

459 
Do you remember how he always us 
has beaten the crap? 

460 
Okay, we just change the from, two Men 
go in, one comes out again, 

461 
We fight to the death, you 
and I, brother against brother, 

462 
Okay? You know you want it, 
You know that you feel it, 

463 
We put the guns away and 
get it right, Down and ,,, 

464 
You should have time to mention! 

465 
It seems like I would be the last 10 
Run after years of remembrance, 

466 
And I'm tired, 

467 
And, who is now bankrupt, 
lonely and dead, John, huh? 

468 
We both, Sam, 

469 
You just do not know yet, 

470 
I think now not more, 

471 
Goodbye, John, 

472 
You had debt ,,, and have paid, 

473 
Have you ever wondered 
why one remains simple? 

474 
All move, but one that 
one simply stops, 

475 
Furthermore, I have recently 
Time thinking a lot,
