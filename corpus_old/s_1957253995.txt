Hey! My purse!
He's got my purse!

Hey, stop him!
Come on.

Somebody stop him!
He's got my purse!

Police! Freeze!

Hey! Stop! Out of my way!

Get out of my way!
Out of my way! Police!

Move!

You did not
just go down there...

What the fuck?

Fuck sakes.

Get your fucking hands
in the air!

I ain't gonna
say it again, motherfucker!

Fuck.

<i>Hello,
Detective Bozwick.</i>

<i>I want to play a game.</i>
No!

<i>The 3 train is arriving
in two minutes.</i>

<i>It is up to you to decide</i>

<i>if this will be
your final stop.</i>

<i>You have taken
the witness stand many times,</i>

<i>and railroaded innocent people
with your lies,</i>

<i>putting them away in jail.</i>

<i>Today, it is you
who will be railroaded.</i>

<i>You have one chance to live.</i>

<i>Tear from your mouth the tongue
that has so often been used</i>

<i>to lie and to deceive.</i>

<i>Take a leap of faith,
and you will live.</i>

<i>Only your weight will rip away</i>

<i>your lying tongue and save you.</i>

<i>Live or die, make your choice.</i>

<i>What you talking about?
That movie won awards.</i>

<i>You know, Tom Hanks
is a straight pimp, man,</i>

<i>but I don't know if you could
make that movie today.</i>

What the fuck
you going on about?

Special needs abuse.
Special needs?

What, you woke now?
Not woke,

but you can't say "handicapped,"
you can't say "retarded."

You got to say "special needs,"
I'm trying to be respectful.

Forrest Gump
was special needs, man.

What was the name of the girl?

Jenny.
Jenny.

He did everything for Jenny.

This motherfucker did some shit.

He jogged across
the whole country.

He beat China in ping-pong.

You know how fucking hard
that shit is?

He was a war hero.

Who the fuck is nicer
than Forrest Gump?

His best friend

was a nigga and a white boy
with no legs.

He made a billion dollars
selling shrimp.

And she still wouldn't fuck him.

Hey, eventually,
they got together.

Yeah, after she got AIDS.

As soon as she got AIDS,
she's like, "Hey, Forrest..."

Get the fuck out of here, man.

Giving that guy AIDS?

Are you kidding me?
Yeah.

That shit's abusive.
But he ain't get it.

I ain't see no sequel.
Where's <i>Gump 2?</i>

Yo, Rico just got off
the elevator.

Oh, shit.

Let's do this.

Get down! Get down right now!

Get down right now!
You know what this is!

You know what this is!

That's right! Put it all!
Come on! Down!

Fill up this bag! Put it
in the motherfucking bag!

Come on.

You know what to do!
Chill!

Get back!

I want that coke!
I want that money!

I want everything!

Shit.

Ninety seconds,
we gotta go!

Freeze! Police!

Hands up! Get your hands up!

Get out of the car.
Get the fuck out of...

Zeke? Is that you?

Zeke?

What the fuck
is wrong with you?

You do an undercover op...

You don't clear it,
there's no coordination.

We are Homicide,

but you're robbing drug dealers
in a fucking hotel.

I had a dozen 911 calls come in.

What if someone got killed?

That crew killed four people
last week, and we got them.

And we could have got more of
them if my cover wasn't blown.

Fuck your cover, Zeke!

You were off on your own,
as usual, no backup, nothing.

No backup, 'cause there's
nobody on the force

I can fucking trust!

From now on, you're going
to learn to be a team player.

You're getting a partner.
Jeannie, send Schenk in.

Do I look like
a fucking Jamaican nanny?

Do I smell like jerk sauce
and baby wipes? No!

Me no want no partner!

I'm not
babysitting some fucking rook.

Yes, you are.

Just because your dad was
Chief fucking Marcus Banks

doesn't mean
you get out of the shit.

Stop making this
about my father, okay?

He's gone, you're the head
of the department now.

Yeah. Drama queen.

Zeke, it's been 12 years.

Yes! Twelve fucking years.

Twelve years ago,
I turned in a dirty cop,

I get a medal for it.
Big fucking deal!

I also got a bullet,

and I got to look over my back
for the rest of my career.

Shut up!

It is too fucking hot in here

for me to listen
to this bullshit.

I got a heat wave going on.

We got rolling blackouts,

the city is nuts. Stop!

You wanted to see me, Captain?

Yeah, come in.

Zeke, I want you to meet

Detective in training,
William Schenk.

He was the top of his academy,
so don't screw this up.

Zeke is going to break you in,
show you the ropes.

Detective Banks, it's good to...

Yup...

Go.
Okay.

<i>Officer Harris, 1-0-3.</i>

<i>Officer Harris, 1-0-3.</i>

<i>Sergeant Jones, front desk.</i>

<i>Sergeant Jones, front desk.</i>

So, uh... How do you take
your coffee in the morning?

Alone.

Okay.

Hey, man, I get it.

I wouldn't want to be stuck
with some random kid either.

You don't want to be my partner.

You don't know that.

Your dad's the reason
for all of this.

He's why I wanted to do this
in the first place.

And I'm not him.

Prepare to be underwhelmed.

Banks and Schenk...

Some homeless guy got hit
by the 3 train. You're up.

<i>Detective Peterson,</i>

<i>pick up 2-2-1.
Detective Peterson, 2-2-1.</i>

This is you?

Beats the squad car.

Detective Banks
en route to that 10-19.

Would that be north
or south side of the street?

<i>Northbound.</i>
Copy that.

What are you doing?

Oh, it's just family.

This is my wife, Emma,
this is my son, Charlie.

They're cute.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

"While it lasts"?

Nothing happier than the wife
of a new detective,

and nothing more angry

than that same bitch
10 years later.

Maybe it's 'cause
you call them bitches.

I'm half-Italian, trust me.

Women do not like it
when you call them bitches...

What are you telling me
about women,

young motherfucker? Shit.

I just said it to you,
I didn't say it to a woman.

I don't say it to their face.
It's not like I'm Too Short.

We just met, but, you know,
you're firing already, and I appreciate it.

I mean, all I'm saying is,
you know,

most crime happens
on weekends, holidays,

so you would think
anybody married to a cop

would understand this.

But no.

One day, your wife will be angry

'cause you couldn't go to
her sister's birthday dinner.

You can give a woman
600 Tuesdays.

It ain't worth
three Saturday nights.

So, uh... I'm guessing
you're divorced.

Divorced, no, not yet.
I'm going through a divorce.

That's even worse.
It's kind of like chemo.

Shit. Sorry.

Sorry for what? We're cops.
This is the life we choose.

Highest divorce rate,
highest suicide rate.

Highest rate
of domestic violence.

Yo, when you decided
to become a cop,

you pretty much assured yourself

you were gonna die alone.

My wife and I,
we're doing this counseling.

She's got me, uh, working on,
like, communication.

Counseling?
Yeah, that's nice.

Yeah, my wife
fucked the counselor.

Fuck, really?

Yeah.
Jesus.

Women cheat, too.

It hurts. God damn it, it hurts.

Women cheat, too,
but here's what happens.

Women cheat in the daytime.

You can get away with
a lot of shit in the daytime.

That's right. You can ride

a lot of dick before dusk.
Mmm-hmm.

Shit, man, I just found out
Pilates doesn't even exist.

Wait, seriously?

Emma loves Pilates.

I'm sure she does.
I'm sure she does.

But don't worry about it.

You're gonna be fine.
You gonna be married forever.

What do we got?

See for yourself.

Watch yourself.

Ugh.

If you're gonna throw up,
don't do it on the evidence.

Are you kidding me?

I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

Ugh.

You see a lot of TV sets
on the subway?

You get everything
down here.

Damn. Wow.

Ugh.

This bum's
gonna be tough to ID.

I'm not too sure this is a bum.

I don't know a lot of bums
trying to get their steps in.

Whoever this is, is married...

and wears a Fitbit.

This package just came in.

For me?
Yeah.

What is that?

"Play me."

Okay.
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

Don't want to fuck up
my computer.

<i>Hello, Detective Banks.</i>

<i>I'm here to help reform
the Metro Police,</i>

<i>to remind them of their oath
to the people of this city.</i>

<i>One officer from your station
refused to be reformed.</i>

<i>He will not be the last
to play my game.</i>

If that spiral
is what I think it is...

Jigsaw?

Wait, I thought
the Jigsaw killer was dead?

Yeah, but if it's
another copycat...

It's gonna be a shit show.

I recognize that building.

It's the courthouse.

Let's check it out.

What are you guys
doing here?

Well, we thought you boys
might need some backup.

Fuck you, Fitch,
it's not your case.

Yo, Zeke.

What do we got here?

What the fuck is that?

Is that a fucking tongue?

Fucking shit.

4-5-3... Who's 4-5-3?

Circle up!

Okay, here's what we know.

Dental records confirm it's Boz.

Sorry, guys.

But, look, we got to catch the
son of a bitch that did this.

Train conductor says
he didn't see much.

Says he saw
Boz hanging in the air

right before
he hit the windshield.

Says he thinks he saw Boz
bleeding from the mouth badly.

The package was sent
from a delivery service

that picked it up
on a stoop on Anglin Drive.

What about the spirals?

Hey, Cap, obviously
it's a Jigsaw copycat,

so that's where we got to
concentrate our focus.

Sure, Fitch, but I want you
to stick with hard evidence.

Kraus, contact the Feds,
get anything they got.

Files, old videos, anything.

Do we have street images?

We're working on it,
but Digital Forensics was

able to map Boz's movement
off the Fitbit.

Last place it was registered
was Stuart's Point,

time-stamped
during the fireworks.

Someone needs to call Kara,
his wife, let her. know.

Yeah, I already called her.

You called Kara?

Yeah.

Do you know Kara?
No.

Did you actually talk to her,
or did you text her?

Let me guess,
you sent an emoji.

Do they have
a dead husband emoji?

I talked to her, asshole.

Hey. We had to notify her
before it leaked to the press.

Okay, O'Brien's got point...

O'Brien?

This is mine.

Me and the rook
were first on scene.

Banks...

I'm sorry, isn't this protocol?

Now you're part of
the team again, Zeke?

Fuck you.

No, fuck you.

Come on, Zeke.

When all you motherfuckers
were treating me like shit,

shooting me in my fucking back,

Boz was my friend!

Boz played with my kid.

We went to fucking games.

Fuck me? No, fuck you.

Fucking assholes...

Zeke! Zeke, fucking stop!

In here! Now!

Zip up! Get out.

Okay, Captain.

Damn, nigga, wash your hands.

I get why you want this.

Boz was my friend, too,
but you can't do this alone.

I need the whole department
on this, working together.

I'm not trying
to do this alone, okay?

Boz is my family, man.
You gotta let me take lead.

You gotta let me catch
this motherfucker.

All right, guys,
we got a change of plans.

Banks is taking lead.

Listen up.

I know some of you guys
think I'm a rat.

Some of you think I'm a snitch.

Some of you are mad
I fucked your mother.

Boz was last seen

at the July 4th parade
at Stuart's Point...

...so there should be plenty
of surveillance footage,

so check your hashtags,
Instagram...

Hey!

Now, we got a dead cop here,
guys, who was brutally killed.

A fallen brother
whose tongue was ripped out.

We need to focus on the case
and solve this.

So get the footage
to Detective Banks

and put your
personal shit aside.

O'Brien, you good?

No problem here, Captain.

Good.

Let's go.

Yo, where we going?

Pay our respects. Put on a suit.

Zeke...

Kara...

It's okay.

Whoever did this,
I'm gonna find them.

I don't understand...
How did it happen?

Kara,
your mother's on the phone.

Yeah, okay.

Zeke.

Lisa.

You okay? I, uh... I texted you.

Yeah, I got it.

Is Brian here?

No, my sister's watching him.

Your sister... So, Rhonda gets
to see my son, but I don't?

Are we really gonna
do this here?

No. Not today.

Hey, I'm William.
Stop.

Zeke's partner, yup...

I'll wait outside.
I'll wait outside.

Jamie's at the neighbor's.

I don't know how I'm supposed to
tell him what happened to his dad.

I can't imagine what
you're going through right now.

I know this is a bad time,

but I got to ask you
a couple of questions.

In the last few weeks,

did you notice anything unusual?

I mean, did Boz say anything,
or act stressed out?

He was a cop, Zeke.

So nothing out of the ordinary?

No.

There was one thing,
there was a black SUV

parked outside
one night last week.

You get a make?

Range Rover, Escalade, Lincoln?
I don't know.

I told Boz about it
and he went out,

and he walked up,
and, I don't know,

the next thing I know, he was
yelling at somebody inside.

Any idea
what they were yelling about?

Did you hear anything?

No. If I see it again,
I'll get a license plate.

If you don't mind,
could you get me his devices?

I need to look
at his iPad, laptop.

Yeah.
Thanks, Kara.

Nice... I gotta go, guys.
All right, be safe.

Zeke.

He knew you were a good cop.

You find out who did this.

You pull a gun on your old man?

You out of your fucking mind?

I could have killed you.

What are you talking about?
I got the gun.

I could have killed you.

How'd you get in here?

Did you forget
who the landlord is?

Yeah, but that doesn't
give you the right

to just walk in here
anytime you want.

Renters got rights.

You start paying some rent,
you can get some rights.

Heard about Boz. You all right?

No, Dad, I'm... I'm fucked up.

Sorry to hear that.
I know how close you were.

Jigsaw copycat.
That could be difficult.

What are you saying?
Nothing.

Just, you know,
being lead detective,

a lot of responsibility.

You got a problem with that?

Or are you just scared
I'm gonna embarrass you?

See? That right there.

This ain't about you.

You always making shit
about you.

That's the shit
that ruined your career

and your marriage.

So, now you're giving
fatherly advice?

What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?

Dad. We live
in the same building.

I saw you out front
the other day,

you nodded at me like we were the
only two black guys in the mall.

We haven't had a meal together
in over a year.

Haven't had a meal?

What? Are you hungry, nigga?

You want to go get
a fucking slice?

Let me tell you something.

My father went to work,
came home. That was it.

All right, I'm gonna
get out of here, son.

I'm gonna go to Kara's,
pay my respects.

You're gonna be all right.

Come over tonight, I'll order some
food, we'll go over the case.

Just because your dad was
Chief fucking Marcus Banks...

Stop making this about my father.
Twelve years ago,

I turned in a dirty cop.

Pete! Pete!

What happened? What happened?

He pulled a gun on me.

The witness pulled a gun on you?

Because there's nobody on the force
I can fucking trust!

I've been staring at this shit
for five hours.

I don't even look at porn
that long.

Okay, I'm out. What's next?

Well, why don't you check
with Digital Forensics

and see if anybody in Boz's
phone log has a black SUV?

My phone is dead,
you got a charger?

Your phone's dead,
what are you, a little girl?

Let me borrow your phone,
shut up.

Okay.

Thank you.

Don't drain my battery
watching <i>Twilight.</i>

Glad to see you joined us.

You think this is linked
to John Kramer?

I sent some pictures to the
Feds, we'll see what happens.

How are we doing
on surveillance?

Please tell me the $20 million the
city spent on cameras got us something?

Drury?

Yeah... Street cameras
from here to here

have already been
scrubbed through.

Facial recognition came up
with nothing.

There were two cameras
broken on this corner.

<i>Fitch and Kraus are there now
to canvas it.</i>

No. Closed. Closed.

There's Boz.

Who's that he's chasing?

I know that guy.

Benny Wrights. He's a hustler.

Serious tweaker.

Flops in a burnt-out
bread factory down on 12th.

Deals with a pusher,
street name Speez.

Should we tell Zeke?
Fuck him.

I'll take the building,
you track down Speez.

Hey, boss, let me see
that gun over there.

The one on the left.
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.

On behalf of the Metro Police,

I want to thank you
for your generosity.

I got shit to do. I'm out.

What's his deal?

He's a crooked piece of shit.

Let's just call it a night.
You sure?

Yeah. Go home.

Go see your wife,
go see your kid.

What's your boy's name?

Charlie.
Charlie.

All right, I'll put him down
and come right back.

No, no, no,
I'm not going to be here.

Meeting my dad for dinner,
gonna go over the case.

Okay.

Hey, William.

Yeah?

Good work today.

Thanks, man.

See you tomorrow.
Yeah.

Benny?

Wake up, Benny.

Rise and shine, my man.

Benny, come on. Get up.

Come on, Benny, get up.

You all right?

Fuck me.

<i>This is Deborah
Kraus, leave me a message.</i>

Kraus, call me.

<i>Lieutenant Tim O'Brien here,</i>

<i>leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

Help! Help me!

<i>Hello, Detective Fitch.</i>

<i>I want to play a game.</i>

<i>Hey, Zeke.</i>
William.

<i>What are you doing up?</i>

<i>I told you to take
the rest of the night off.</i>

Uh, it's fine,
Charlie's sleeping.

Was sleeping.

Just waiting for Emma to get
home, she's having a girl's night.

Girl's night out. Okay.

You better be careful with that,

might be a dick night out.

Just because
you're getting a divorce,

it doesn't mean that everyone
else's marriages have to end, too.

Sounds like
you got your hands full.

You want to call me back?

<i>Nah, it's okay,</i>

<i>we're sleep-training.
It's a fucking nightmare.</i>

Look, man, um... I know
you and Boz were close,

<i>I don't know
how to tell you this.</i>

You got something to say,
William, say it.

Well, I'm looking through all
the Metro records like you asked,

and Boz was accused of lying on
the stand more than anybody...

by like a wide fucking margin.

<i>Jesus.</i>

The courthouse...

That's why the tongue
was at the courthouse.

Can I help you?

Are you Marcus Banks?

No, I'm his son.
Well, Terroni delivery.

Oh, okay.

Dad!

Pop, got your food.

Motherfucker!

How the fuck
could you not call me first?

I tried, but you didn't answer.

Well, why didn't you wait for me
to fucking call you back?

'Cause you would have
talked me out of it.

I told the truth.

Get the fuck
out of my face, Zeke.

Can we get the room?

God damn it.

I knew I should have never
let him become a cop.

This shit's gonna go
sideways fast.

He turned in a dirty cop.
Pete was a scumbag.

Press will make him out
to be a hero.

And what about the other cops?

You think they're gonna
call him a hero, too?

He did the right thing.

You know how much internal
damage control I have to do?

We'll handle it.

We always do, huh?

Chief Banks,
WF Action News here.

Are you in?

Oh, I'm sorry,
but I think your face

was trespassing on my property.

Is there something
I can help you with?

No.

All right. Fuck you very much.

For Detective Zeke Banks.

Banks, incoming.

On my desk. Right now.

A courier brought it.

We're holding him
for questioning.

<i>Hello, Detective Banks.</i>

<i>Salvation was offered,
but it was declined.</i>

This fucker thinks he's Jigsaw.

Even got a doll this time.

<i>I have a bone to pick
with the police department,</i>

<i>and if you're going
to point fingers...</i>

12th Street Bridge.
I know that place.

<i>...you should start by
pointing them at yourselves.</i>

Geez, that's two blocks away.

<i>Until you come clean,
many more will die.</i>

Stay back.

Stay sharp.

Whoa,
hold it there, guys.

What a sick fuck, man.

What the fuck?

Oh, no...

God almighty.

9-8-2.

It's Fitch.

<i>This is Detective Banks</i>

requesting backup.

<i>I'm on Decker Street.
Request backup!</i>

Fuck him.
<i>In pursuit,</i>

requesting backup!

Ah, fuck!
Fuck me.

You're going
to be okay, stay with me.

You're good,
you're gonna be okay.

You're gonna be just fine.

Zeke!
Sir! Please, please!

Let us do our job, come on.

Come on, let us do our jobs,
let's go. Let's go.

Where the fuck
were all of you, huh?

My son called for backup
three times in eight minutes

and none of you motherfuckers
could get here?

Nobody? Nothing?

Crickets. All right,
this is what I'm going to do.

I'm going to call Dispatch

and find out
who was closest available,

and when I do,
I'm going to take this gun

and shoot that motherfucker.

We clear?

Fitch, it was you?

You fucking with my son again?

God damn you, son of a bitch!

Get off me!

You're done, motherfucker,
you hear me?

You're fucking done!

Don't let me see
your face again.

All right, call Kraus,

find out Fitch's last location.

<i>Hello, Detective Fitch.</i>

<i>I want to play a game.</i>

<i>The tide of justice
is rising around you.</i>

<i>In 90 seconds,
the water will rise</i>

<i>to the height
of the copper wires,</i>

<i>and if you are still
in the tank,</i>

<i>you will be electrocuted.</i>

<i>Unless you make the sacrifice
that will cleanse you.</i>

God... Oh, God...

<i>You murdered a man
because he insulted you.</i>

<i>Put your hands</i>

<i>where I can see them,
motherfucker.</i>

<i>I said put your hands
where I can see them, sir.</i>

<i>Your finger pulled the trigger</i>

<i>and that cannot happen again.</i>

<i>Survival is simple,
but it comes with a sacrifice.</i>

<i>Bite down on the device
in your mouth,</i>

<i>which will start the motor</i>

<i>that will
rip your fingers away...</i>

<i>...leaving you free</i>

<i>to escape with your life.</i>

<i>But if you don't act quickly,</i>

<i>all that awaits you
is this watery tomb.</i>

<i>Live or die, make your choice.</i>

Hey, Kraus, anything special about
the bridge where we found the fingers?

Yeah, why that bridge?

It was where he shot that kid,
Jimmy Lincoln.

Then how did you guys
find out about this place?

This guy, Benny Wrights,

who Boz was last seen with
on July 4th.

How do you know
who Boz was last seen with?

We took it off a pawn shop feed
in Stuart Point.

And you didn't tell me.

Who the fuck did this?

Somebody who has it out
for the Metro PD.

Or maybe just for Fitch.

You trying to
say something, Drury?

You know what I'm saying.

I doubt you'll be
shedding tears for Fitch.

All right, come on.
Come on, Zeke.

Fucking asshole.

Okay, ignore him.

Did you get anything?

Got a name. Benny Wrights.
Last guy Boz was seen with.

Okay, find him,
and you got hours, not days.

And this is where
Benny gets his meth.

You know what that is?

Is this a test?

Just asking you a question.
Uh, it's a meth house.

You put the money in the bucket,
the meth comes down.

Oh, somebody watched <i>The Wire.</i>

This is some
<i>New Jack City</i> shit. Goddamn.

Don't we need
a warrant for this?

What you talking about?

Zeke...

Hey, my man, my man.

Just trying to get a five,
me and my lady!

It's our anniversary,
we're trying to celebrate,

trying to do
something special.

Can I get a five?
How about this iPad?

It's got everything on it.

I got passcodes,
I got Netflix, Hulu,

uh, Uber Eats, Postmates.
Lots of food, lots of food.

Let me see that...

Yo, man,
get the fuck out of here.

Do I look
fucking hungry to you?

Yo, yo, it got everything.
It don't fit, though.

Why don't you come down?

Get the fuck out of here!

Come back
when you get some money!

Okay, okay. I need money,
I need money.

No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait!

I got some,
I got some money.

I got some money,
hold up a second.

Hold up a second, all right?

All right, send it down, baby.

Come on, come on,
let's do this.

Can't wait!

Zeke, what the fuck?

It's got 10 seconds,
come on!

Jesus Christ.

What the fuck?

Move!
Get out of the way.

Out of my way,
out of my way! Police!

Five-o!

Everybody, five-o!
Move, move, move! Come on!

Go! Coming through.

Fucking cops, man.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Shit! Get your dog!

Fuck you, man.
Get your fucking dog!

Now!
Hey, be nice.

Jesus Christ.

Holy fucking shit.

What the fuck's going on?

Back inside.
Get back inside.

Hide your shit!

Come on!

Fuck. Fuck!

My fucking leg!

Why do you make this shit
so hard?

What if I really wanted
to get fucked up?

Motherfucker...

You got to make it easy
for the customer, skeeve!

My fucking leg!

That leg is fucked up.

Yo, yo, yo, yo!

Let me get a shot
for the Gram.

Hold on for one second.

What the fuck...
Hold on, hold on.

My man.

Here we go!
You want me to tag you?

Fuck... Fuck you.

Can I tag you, motherfucker?
Fuck you...

You see this man before?

I ain't telling you shit!

Why, 'cause you're worried about
that bone sticking out your leg?

Why don't you
let me sterilize it?

No... No... No! Fuck!

It's Benny! Stop, please!

Everybody knows that
motherfucker Benny Wrights!

He's one of
my best customers, man.

When was the last time
you saw him?

I ain't seen the bitch
in two days, man.

Word on the street
is that motherfucker OD'd.

Fuck this snitch.

Fuck!

Well,
that was a waste of time.

Well, we know Benny's dead.

Meth isn't the type of thing
you take a break from.

Besides, you see that device?

That was not designed
by anybody with rotten teeth.

What do you think about
this whole Jigsaw angle?

You think it's a, what-do-you-call-them,
one of those disciples?

John Kramer
didn't target cops.

Whoever did this
has another motive.

Something personal.

And they're not
following orders,

especially the orders
of a ghost.

Ghost or not,

somebody's out there
pulling all the strings.

You think this guy
sent you the boxes

because you're the
lead detective on the case,

or because you're you?

I don't know.

Well, you got any enemies?
That aren't cops?

I don't know why she
won't give me another chance.

I don't know, maybe
it's because you beat her

when you drink too much.

You ever think of that?

That's some tough love.
Who the hell is this guy?

Ex-cop.
Partner snitched on him,

had to do nine years
hard time.

The system spit him out,
now here he is.

Hey, Pete.

Zeke.

Last guy
I expected to see here.

You trying to get sober?

Alcohol's not my problem.

The glass and the bottle
can kill.

How you doing, Pete?

Eighteen months sober,
living in a church basement,

who could ask
for anything more?

Who's this?

Detective Schenk.
We're working a case together.

Working together?

Don't let this guy
catch you jaywalking,

or he'll stab you
right in the fucking back.

Don't forget, Pete,
you gave me the knife.

You're right, I did.

And you witnessed this cop

throw the victim
off a rooftop?

And you saw it,
I mean, with your own eyes?

And you can positively ID
this cop?

He's had his foot on the neck of
this community for way too long.

We can't have this.

I'll testify,
Officer Dunleavy. I'll do it.

Pete! Pete! What happened?
What happened?

He pulled a gun on me.

The witness
pulled a gun on you?

I was mad for a long time,
but now I take responsibility.

I should have never
pulled the trigger.

The guy had a family.

It was crazy back then, right?

We were working
under Article 8.

We were out of control.

Cops were given their own
discretion to crack down on crime.

Where were you July 4th
at 9:30 p.m.?

Really?
That's what you're here for?

That's what I'm here for.

Look, some guy came
to a meeting drunk

and wanted to fight a sponsor,
so I hit him.

Knocked him clean out.

Anyway, the cops came.
I'm still on probation,

but lucky for me,
it was O'Brien.

He let the whole thing slide
because, you know...

loyalty.

Loyalty.

Take care, Pete.

God loves you, Zeke.

More than you.

<i>Can't believe
that guy used to be a cop.</i>

He shot an innocent guy,
but you turned on him?

There's a code, and you better
learn how to follow it,

or you're going to spend the rest
of your life watching your back.

Fair point.

Maybe it's a good thing
they made us partners.

<i>Leave a message.</i>

Yeah, Dad,
I'm at your apartment.

I was here last night.

It doesn't look like
you've been home.

All right, give me a call.

<i>You've
gotten through to William,</i>

<i>leave a message
after the beep.</i>

Schenk, it's 9:00 a.m.,

where the fuck are you?
Give me a call.

Just tell me
what happened, okay?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Put the box on the ground!

On the ground!
Hands up! Hands up!

On the ground now!
Hands up, hands up!

Don't move!

Get him out of here.

Take him to holding.

I'm sorry, Banks,
he blew right past me.

No way, Zeke,
that one is not the same.

I'm calling the bomb squad.

Angie, you're the head
of the department.

We got two dead cops,
there's no time.

Get everybody out.

Everybody out! Everybody out!

Everybody, go!

Is that fucking skin?
Ugh.

"Am I getting under
your skin, Detective Banks?

"Careful, while you're looking
for more bodies to drop,

"I'll take your head."

"I'll take your head..."

"Am I getting
under your skin...

"Am I getting
under your skin...

"Am I getting
under your skin..."?

...family.
This is my wife, Emma,

this is my son, Charlie.

What the fuck is that?

Captain, there's something
under here.

Constantine Paints.

Thanks, yeah.

Follow me.

How do you know
about this place?

Zeke, how do you know
about this place?

My dad used to take me here.

Watch your step, gentlemen.

It wasn't always
a butcher shop.

Used to be Constantine Trains.

Like a hobby shop.

Oh, my God.

Anything?

Well, we're
analyzing the tape recording.

<i>Hello, Detective Schenk,</i>

<i>I want to play a game.</i>

<i>You were head of your class
at the Police Academy.</i>

He was obviously skinned...

postmortem.

Your dad's the reason I wanted
to do this in the first place.

<i>...the body was scored first</i>

to remove the pieces
in larger strips,

arms, neck,
as he ripped the skin...

Maybe it's a good thing
they made us partners.

Even the defensive wounds,

he clearly tried to fight back,

which explains
the deeper gashes.

Captain, over here.

Is it a serial killer
targeting cops?

Is the victim inside
a policeman?

No comment. Commissioner Hart
will make a statement tonight.

We got to try
to keep his identity

out of the press
until I tell his wife.

<i>"Am I getting under
your skin, Detective Banks?"</i>

Hey, O'Brien.

Yeah, boss?

You seen Zeke?

No, not for a while.

Okay, I'm heading down
to Cold Case.

Copy that, Captain.

<i>I need all available units,</i>

<i>officer down 3rd and Beaman.</i>

<i>Please report, 3rd and Beaman.</i>

What do we got?

I was writing a ticket
and some guy in a pig's mask,

he runs up on me with a knife.

So, he stabs your arm
and just takes off?

I fought him off
the best I could and he...

He took off running.

Is there any reason
he would have to attack you?

No. He just wanted
to mess with the cops.

"Careful, while you're looking
for more bodies to drop,

"I'll take your head."

Angie, you're the head
of the department.

Angie...

Ah, fuck!

Angie! Pick up!

<i>Hey, you've
reached Captain Angie Garza,</i>

<i>leave a message at the tone.
Thanks.</i>

Angie, get to the bullpen!
He's coming for you.

Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

Shit!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hello? Hello! Shit!

Help!

Help!

<i>Hello, Captain Garza.</i>

<i>I want to play a game.</i>

<i>You have covered up corruption
in your department,</i>

<i>never sticking your neck out
for the innocent.</i>

<i>Now, the cover-up
will be on you.</i>

<i>In a few seconds,
boiling hot wax</i>

<i>will be coming out of the pipe
above you.</i>

<i>The only way to stop yourself
from being suffocated</i>

<i>is to sever your spinal cord</i>

<i>with the blade
beneath your neck,</i>

<i>which will stop the wax.</i>

<i>You cannot walk away,</i>

<i>but you can survive.</i>

<i>Live or die, make your choice.</i>

Fuck you!

Angie! Angie!

Get the fuck out of the way!

How come no one
is answering the phone?

An officer was attacked,
it's fucking chaos in here.

Angie! Angie!

Angie?

Zeke, what's going on?

He's got her!

Who's got her?

The killer has Angie!

I guess you didn't hear,
the killer just

attacked a cop
at 3rd and Beaman.

That was just a diversion
to get us out of the precinct.

She's down
in the fucking basement!

Did you find Angie?

In the basement,
in the basement!

<i>Captain Angie Garza,</i>

<i>call the front desk.</i>

Open it!

Hurry up!

Angie!

Open it!

Okay.

Shit!

It's okay, it's okay.
It's gonna be fine.

Oh, my God.

It's okay.

It's okay... Oh...

Lock it down.

You understand me?

Lock it down, nobody gets out
of this precinct.

I need all the footage
from the cameras

in the evidence room.

Okay, here...

Here's when the call came in,

but then there's nothing
until you come in.

You see right there, it jumps
from 13:11 to 13:24. Glitch?

No, there's no glitch,
because look,

on the first frame,
the safe door is open,

but on the next, it's shut.

There's 13 minutes missing.

Access to this footage,

is that through
the computer system?

Yeah, we just need
a badge number and a password.

I can't tell you
who deleted the video,

but I can access who logged into
the server over the past day.

O'Brien, Tupper, Nicholazi...

Wait...
Who's badge number 2-1-3?

Pete Dunleavy, my old partner.

Dunleavy?
He shouldn't have access.

How long's it been
since he was even on the job?

Where you going?

To pay Pete a visit.

Zeke, he's not the only one!

Your father had access, too.

Location of Schenk's body,

you said it was where
your father took you as a kid.

When was the last time
you saw your father?

This morning.
Bullshit.

Motherfucker!

What the fuck, Zeke?

Fuck you, man!

Fuck you!
Get the fuck out of here!

Get him out of here! Fuck you!
You're too close!

You're too close
to this thing, Zeke.

Pete!

Pete!

Pete!

<i>Leave a message.</i>

Dad, I've called you
three times,

please call me back!

People are asking questions
and I'm sick of making excuses.

You got something
to tell me? Fuck!

You wanna play games,
motherfucker?

All right, I'll play.

You okay?

Hey!

Help!

Pete?

Pete, wake up.

Pete!

What? Zeke?

Fuck.

Get me the fuck down, Zeke.

Come on!

You hacked the computer.

You erased
the surveillance footage.

I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, Zeke.

Did you kill Angie?
What?

Did you kill Boz?

What the fuck
are you talking about?

Did you kill Boz?

Boz? Fuck...

What the fuck
is with you, Zeke?

Get me the fuck out of here!

Is this some sick
fucking revenge, Zeke?

Putting me in jail
isn't enough, huh?

Get me the fuck out of here!

<i>Hello, Detective Banks.</i>

<i>I want to play a game.</i>

<i>When Peter Dunleavy
murdered an innocent man,</i>

<i>your career
was shattered like glass.</i>

<i>Can you stand on the sidelines</i>

<i>while justice
is finally served?</i>

<i>There is a way to save him,</i>

<i>or you can keep him locked up
and throw away the key.</i>

<i>The decision is yours.</i>

"Throw away the key,"
what the fuck?

Huh?

Get me the fuck
out of this thing.

Zeke!

Oh, shit.

Come on, Zeke.

Get me the fuck
out of here, Zeke!

Shit!

Zeke! Help me!

Zeke?

Get me down, come on, man.

Zeke!

Zeke!

<i>...or
you can keep him locked up</i>

<i>and throw away the key.</i>

Pete!

I'm coming, Pete!

Shit.

Fuck. I got you, I got you.

Come on, Pete.

Pete!

Pete!

You disloyal
piece of shit.

I've been loyal to you
since the first day we met.

Fifteen years ago.

The day your partner
killed my father.

So, Charlie,

you saw this cop throw
the victim off a rooftop,

and you can positively ID
this cop?

I'll testify, Officer Dunleavy.

I'll do it.

Pete! Pete!
What happened, what happened?

He pulled a gun on me.

The witness
pulled a gun on you?

Shh.

Pete killed Charlie Emmerson.

What? You thought
I'd use my real name?

Do you have any idea
how hard it was

to get placed
in this department,

to get assigned
to be your partner?

What about your family,
what about your son?

This is my son,
Charlie.

I don't have a son.

Charlie's sleeping...

...was sleeping.

<i>After Benny Wrights led Boz
down the subway tunnels...</i>

I tattooed my dad's name
on his arm.

Where is my father?

You'll see him soon.

Where the fuck is my father?

I didn't even ask him
to come down here. You did.

Let me borrow your phone,
shut up.

Okay.

Thank you.

And don't drain
my battery watching <i>Twilight.</i>

Where is he?

Don't you want to hear
my offer?

Do I have a choice?

I want to be partners.

You took a stand, Zeke,
against a dirty cop,

<i>and what did it get you?</i>

A lifetime of watching
your back, working alone.

Getting the call
for every homeless bum

who turns up dead.

I mean, let's be real,
some of these motherfuckers

are straight up evil.

Fitch not backing you up...

Fuck him.

He won't repeat that mistake.

<i>And Boz,
always lying under oath...</i>

But you, you're different.

You're Metro's finest.

That's why I want to
team up with you on this.

You find the dirty cops and
I'll take care of the rest.

You want me to help you
kill cops?

No, fuck no.

Just the bad ones.

John Kramer was right,
the spiral.

A symbol of change,
evolution, progress.

But why limit that
to an individual

when you can apply it
to a whole system?

You got shot
for doing the right thing.

But let's face it, these cops?

They're not going to clean up
on their own.

But we take a tongue here,

a few bones there,
they'll come around.

We're going to fix
a broken department. Okay?

You and me.

Okay.

Okay.

Let's do it.

I want to trust you. I do.

I'm in. But my dad goes free.

One second.

<i>911,
please state your emergency.</i>

Hello, uh, I'm at
the old soap factory

on Madigan Lane.

There's a crazy guy
with a gun,

he's firing it everywhere.
Please hurry!

What the fuck was that?

You better hurry,
Zeke, SWAT's on the way.

Look, I want to believe you,
I do.

I want to trust you.

Take this, you'll need it.

Come on.

Let's go see your dad.

It's time for your final test.

Dad.

Ezekiel.

Oh, shit! Get him down!

Oh, shit.

I got you, Dad.

Zeke. Help me, son.

Don't worry, don't worry.

I'm not going to let you die.
I will get you down.

It's all right, just hold on.

Shoot this motherfucker
right now.

Get him down!
Get him down now!

I thought we were partners.

You going to shoot me, Zeke?

With your one bullet?

Bad idea.

It kills your dad.

He took a shot at me,
by the way.

Missed.

I wasted four.

That means
you got one shot left, Zeke.

All right, cops are here.
That gives us four minutes.

Do you know there's 1.5 gallons
of blood in the human body, Zeke?

At the rate
your old man is bleeding out,

in just three minutes,
those jars will be full

and your dad will be dead.

The only thing
that can set him free

is the bullet in your gun
fired at that target.

Either way, I've got
a foolproof way out of here.

You're not Jigsaw.

That's the game.

Shoot me and you both lose.

Shoot the target
and we both win.

You want to play?

I'm dying, Zeke,
end it now.

<i>In this corridor.</i>

<i>Roger that.
Southwest entrance.</i>

<i>Going through the south door.</i>

<i>Nothing here. Keep moving.</i>

I need you all in.

Dunleavy ruined both our lives

and you tried to help
that piece of shit?

Zeke!
Pete!

You failed that test.

Now I need you to choose
who you're really with.

The man
who corrupted the force,

or the one
who's trying to save it.

You want to tell him, Chief?

Tell me what?

Tell him about all the fucking
shit you did under Article 8.

What's he talking about?

Time's running out.
What's he talking about?

Citizens were dying.

We did what we had to
to clean up the streets.

It was crazy
back then, right?

We were working
under Article 8,

we were out of control.

Murder rate went way down.

That's fucking bullshit.

People felt safe again.

The streets got cleaner
because the cops got dirtier.

Your dad oversaw
the whole thing, by the way.

Innocent people getting shot,
all in the name of justice.

Article 8 was
one of the most corrupt

police policies in history,

and guess who was
your dad's right-hand man?

Sorry, or should I say woman,
the whole time?

We'll handle it.
We always do, huh?

Angie?

Angie!

It was Angie.

I mean,
not a massive surprise.

You think it was
her stellar reputation

that got her a precinct
at age 35? Come on.

Shoot this piece of shit,
Ezekiel. Now.

Yeah, that's right,
because that's what cops do.

Shoot first,
ask questions later.

You watched my father die
and I'm trying to save yours.

If we're going to trust
each other,

I need you to do this.

Ezekiel...

You've always done
the right thing, do it now.

This piece of shit
is killing cops.

You still need to decide,

you can shoot me, or...

Or you can save your dad.

Clock's ticking, man.

Think fast.

Cavalry's coming.

But not in time to do
any favors for your old man.

Only you can do that.

Dad? Dad?

Shots fired!

Zeke... Zeke.

It's going to be okay.

He's getting away.

Don't let him get away.

Go... Go!

Stop. Don't come in.

Don't come in.

Oh, God.

Whoever did this has another
motive, something personal.

Whoever did this...

...they're pulling
all the strings.

Your dad is the reason
for all of this.

He's why I wanted to do this
in the first place.

I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

What the fuck is going on?

Go, go, go!

Get down! Get down now!

Let me see your hands!

No! No, no, stop!

No! God!

Freeze!
No, no!

No!

Put it down!

Lower your weapon!

Fire!

No!
