What have we got?

Male, age 10,

acute abdomen,

low blood pressure,

possible shock.

Looks like
a ruptured viscous.

Run the blood work.

Call surgery. Look, stay
in the waiting room.

I'll be back
to tell you how he's doing.

It's good to be able to come in
here and kneel alone.

But sometimes...

You need somebody

to kneel beside you.

May I?

Please.

I'm Alexander.

John Brighton.

It's my son, Kyle.

His appendix burst

and...

I'm. . .afraid...

of losing him.

Sometimes our
burdens are <i>so</i> heavy

that we can't
find the words

to express what's
in our hearts.

Do you mind if I say
a prayer for your son?

Please.

You told us, Lord if there was
anything we wanted,

to come to you.

Well, we come to you now.

This is John, Lord,

whose heart is burdened
and heavy-laden.

He has a son, Kyle,
whom he loves very much

and Kyle is sick,
Kyle is deathly sick,

<i>so</i> we're asking you Lord,
to save Kyle.

And we know you can do it

through the blood
that you shed for us.

Heal him Lord...

and heal him now.

This we ask in the name

of thy son, Jesus.

Amen.

Well...

We've laid it out before him

like he told us.

The rest. . .
Is up to him.

Thank you.

Thank you <i>so</i> much,
Alexander.

Are you a
chaplain here?

<i>No, no.</i>

But I've
come here many times.

Many times but...

I, ah. . .Won't be
coming anymore.

Not now.

What were you here
to pray about?

My wife. . .My Marjorie.

She had cancer...

And she passed away
this morning.

I'm sorry.

John, you are a lucky man.

Marjorie and I, we wanted to have
kids but we never did.

You have a family.

Love your family, John.

Love them
with everything you got.

And about Kyle. . .trust him.

Kyle will be all right.

Everett Wayne Anderson.

Terry Ernestine Anderson,

where's the camera?

I gave it
to you.

It's hanging
on your shoulder!

Oh, oh! I don't believe it.

If you need help locating
your sunglasses later,

I'd be happy
to help you look.

Thank you
very much.

Kyle Alexander Brighton.

How are those burgers
coming, pastor?

Well, John, they're
sort of a burnt offering.

I thought Kyle
ate a lot.

He does, but now you've got 50
Kyles together in one place.

Reminds me of the movie
"the thing that ate Pittsburgh."

So anyway, this account is sitting
there

like this, like this big plum ready to
be picked off the tree

you know what
your old man says?

"I think we should stop
and think about it."

What is that
all about, Kyle?

You're majoring
in business, right?

That's right uncle Phil.

Here's your first lesson...

Great-- each minute Kyle
talks with my brother

it takes me an hour
to deprogram him.

I call it uncle Phil detox.

Listen to me. Candi and I want to
give you something that's

well, a little something
that's real...

A little going away present.

No, no...

C' mon Kyle, look at it as an
investment in your future.

Now remember, if you want
something in life

you got to go for it.

C' mon Kyle,
pull harder!

Ohhhh!!

You were right, Teri.

I didn't think it would
work but, sure enough!

Ah, you're a good kid, Kyle.

I like you.

Did you see what
Phil did to Kyle?

You and Phil are just
like your dad-- always...

Don't ever say that--
Phil's like dad, I'm not.

Hey, this is me remember,
the one who's on your side.

Why can't he be committed
to one woman and settle down?

Look at him, he's got
a different woman

every time we see him.

John, Phil is not
your responsibility.

Let God handle it.

Ah, wait...

<i>I'm...</i>

I'm winded--
I'm never winded.

Well, you know what they say
about growing old.

No, what do they
say about growing old?

Actually, they don't say anything at
all.

But I do remember
you saying

that I'm the one
who's growing old

while you stay
the same age.

That's true--you're a cradle
robber. I'm going to go back.

You want me to go with you?

<i>No, no. No. No.</i>

You need
the exercise.

You know what they say
about middle-aged men?

What do they say?

The legs are the first to go.

Oh, thanks a lot.

You going to
be okay?

I'm fine-- I may lie down
a bit, but I'm fine.

All right. See you
in a while.

Oh, Kyle. . .you forgot Johnny.

Ma, I don't
need Johnny.

But you've always taken him.

I know, but,
keep him here.

I'll be home
lots of weekends,

don't worry, with big bags
of laundry.

So things won't
change that much.

I love you, sweetheart.

I love you too,
mom.

Don't worry.

I'll tell you about
what worries me.

What's that, dad?

Well, you letting yourself
be influenced

by your uncle Phil's <i>school</i>
of business.

Dad.

Now remember, living by God's
principles is not exactly

on the top of his list
of priorities.

Even though he's my business
partner and my brother

we always don't see
eye-to-eye on things.

Dad, don't worry.

I'm not as dumb
as I look.

Dad, I can see
what's going on.

Don't worry.

I love you son.

I'm proud of you.

I love you too, dad.

See you squirt!

I'm almost 16-- you can't
call me that anymore!

Okay--try not to flunk out
of <i>school</i> this year, okay?

Oh right, and how many academic
scholarships did Mr. IQ get?

Huh?

Now they decide
to get along.

Now get out of here,
will ya?

I love you guys.

Fight you for his room?

Don't you mean
my new study?

Oh!!!

They're right
in the palm of our hand.

All we have to do is
squeeze them a little bit.

C' mon John,
use that charm of yours.

Slow down
will you?

Don't use such
a big club.

What do you mean?

I mean, you don't have to steamroll
every deal, Phil,

I want you to walk a little softer
on this one.

Okay? For once!

It's the way
to do business.

It's the way
you do business.

It's not my way, not
like the Callahan deal.

What about
the Callahan deal?

You promised them the world, then
we couldn't deliver.

No firm could-- you
misled them, Phil.

Lied, really.

Oooo-- here <i>comes</i>
the moral police again.

Yeah, I lied! Everybody does.

If our word is
no good,

we can't expect their word
to be any good,

then nobody is committed
to the deal

on either side
of the table.

We do not approach
this deal that way.

Fine.

Would you mind knocking?

What are you wearing???

Stuff for school.

Well, you can just take it back to
wherever you got it.

You're not going to go out of this
house dressed like that.

Why not? All the girls
dress like this.

Well you're not going
to dress like this.

What do you want me to do,
wear skirts down to my ankles?

Just do as I tell you,
Teri-- that's enough!!

Look, just because your baby left
for college doesn't mean

you can take your
frustrations out on me.

I'm just doing
nothing...

Stop it. . .Stop it.

Stop it! Stop it!

Stop it!
Slop it!

Hi, honey.

Hi, sweetheart.

How was
your day?

Good, I think. We're waiting
to find out any time

about that Atlantic Petroleum
account-- we're really close.

Where is the mail?

I don't know,
maybe Teri has it.

Has what?

The mail.

How could I have it?
I just got home.

You're kidding. That's great!
we got the account.

Oh, wonderful.

Well, I found the mail.

It's right here where it should be--
next to the margarine?

How did it get in there?

Hold on a second, Phil.

Don't look at me.

Well, I didn't put it
in there, John?

Ellen, don't look at me,
it had to be you.

Unless the mail carrier decided to
put it in there.

Ellen, you're getting
nuts on us.

No, she put the mail
in the refrigerator.

Yeah, that's right--

probably trying to freeze
some of my assets.

At least what I've got.

Well, this is great!

Our next speaker was awarded
Harrison Elementary's

Our next speaker was awarded
Harrison Elementary's

teacher of the year this spring.

I've heard rumors she might run for
<i>school</i> board next year,

and I want to go
on record right now

and say that I will personally
campaign for

anyone who runs
against her...

Because we simply can't
lose her as a teacher.

Please welcome, Ellen Brighton.

After 6 long months
of hard work from all of us,

well, maybe not all of 'em.

I think we finally reached

the next plateau
with Atlantic Petroleum.

This time we finally struck oil!

Now if you'll open your
presentation...

If every teacher had someone
as supportive as Valerie,

this profession would be
a lot easier.

I'd like to...

I'd like to, um...

I'd like to talk
to you today...

I-I I must need glasses,

I can't...

I never thought
I'd need glasses.

Um...

Oh goodness...

I'm sorry Valerie, l...

Do you mind if I don't...

ls there a doctor!

Well, it isn't cancer--
that much we know for certain.

No sign of a brain tumor

that might have caused
you to collapse.

Oh, thank God.

But I'm afraid
the news isn't good.

All of our tests are
pointing in one direction.

Ellen, we believe that you have a
form of dementia.

It could be Alzheimer's disease.

<i>Why. . Aha...</i>

That's ridiculous.

Alzheimer's is an
old person's disease.

You're right.
In the vast majority of cases

it strikes people over 65.

But a very small minority contract
it much younger.

Your test results indicate

a 90% probability that
you have the disease.

But what about the other 10%?

Shouldn't we get
a second opinion?

Of course,
we want you to.

Nothing would make us happier than
to be proven wrong.

Look, we can
fight this.

Maybe they're
wrong.

They're not wrong.

Sweetheart, we'll get everyone
at church to pray.

We can face this
together.

Together-- what are you
talking about?

Pretty soon you are
going to be the one

who's going to be facing things all
by yourself

and I'm going to become
more isolated, more alone.

No, we won't let
that happen.

The children
and l...

No! You're not going
to tell the children.

Ellen. . . No!

I don't want Kyle
and Teri to know.

Why?

I just...

I want my life to be...

Normal for as long as possible.

Look at Teri, she doesn't even
listen to me now.

If she thinks I'm brain-dead I'll lose
her completely.

So please, promise me,
don't tell them.

Where have you been? I've been
paging you all afternoon.

We had a doctor's
appointment.

Again?. . .For who?

Are you both okay?

Oh, the appointment was for me.
I'm fine. Just some tests.

I feel fine. Sorry I stole
John from you for a while.

Where have you guys been?
hey uncle Phil.

Hey, Teri.

Can you stay for dinner?

No thanks. I'm just gonna talk to
John for a second.

So what's up?

So what's up?

Just the biggest deal
of our lives!!

Hello!? I needed to
contact you today.

They invented pagers
just for that purpose,

remember, they go
in your belt?

Phil, there are more important things
in life than this deal.

Such as?

I needed to be with Ellen.

Who were you with today?

Ah, gee. . .
clients?

Look, I'm sorry,

I'll try not to
let it happen again.

Want to stay for dinner?

Nah, I can't.

I've got a hot date.

I'm going to tell
Barbara today.

<i>Good .</i>

I'm glad. You need
to tell someone.

So do you.

How can he let
these things happen?

I don't know John.

All I know is how much I miss her
even now, my Marjorie,

after all these years.

I've spent a lot of private time
praying in these woods, John.

I don't know if I even know how
to pray anymore.

I didn't either.

I agonized and struggled--
I fought.

But the one thing I discovered that I
couldn't do

was hold on to her.

I had to let go--
in my mind.

I built an altar, right here.

And on it I laid
the one I loved

more than anything
in all the world.

I gave her up to him.

It's all right if we wrestle with God
on some things,

but remember. . .
we can trust his hand,

even if we don't
understand his plan.

When all is said and done,
we have to trust in him,

even though our questions
are not answered.

Now I've gone over the figures and
everything looks fine,

but what we need are the results
of that land survey.

But what we need are the results
of that land survey.

Do you know anything
about it John?

John?

I'm sorry, what did you say?

Yes, Alex, I'll take distracted
executives for $300.

He at important meetings seems

frequently pre-occupied and
inattentive.

Who is John Brighton?

That' s correct!

Brighton associates is
now in double jeopardy.

All right. All right.
let's keep going.

"William pulled out the canteen and
took a long drink.

The water felt good as it rolled
down his parch-ed throat."

Mrs. Brighton,
he said "parch-ed."

What?

It's supposed to be
"parched."

Oh, yes, that's
"parched", Jim.

Please continue.

It's Justin.

Oh. . .Oh,
of course it is.

I'm sorry.

"Down his parched throat.

"Then he passed the canteen
to his friends

and they each took long drinks until
it was empty."

Do you want me
to go on Mrs. Brighton?

No, no, that was fine.
thank you.

Um...

Who would like
to continue?

I'm not a teacher anymore.

I resigned today.

Valerie was
just terrific, she...

She said that she would get a sub
for as long as I needed

and that when I was ready
to come back...

Oh, Ellen.

Kyle is coming home this weekend

and I think it's time
to tell the children.

I'm going to drop
out of college--

you're going to
need help.

No, Kyle, I don't want
you to do that.

But I want
to be here.

You've always been there
for us and now it's our turn.

We'll be fine.

What I want is

for both of you to go on with
your lives, grow, love God.

It would break my heart
if you stopped doing that.

You don't want to break
your mother's heart do you?

What's going to happen
to you, mom?

Nobody knows exactly...

What will happen
but I'll, I'll probably...

I will lose my memory.

Maybe slowly. . .
and maybe quickly.

I may not...

I may not
know you...

Any of you.

But if that day comes,
I want you to remember

that the real me...

ls still there...

loving you
as much as ever.

Each of us is in God's hands.

And I think he wants us

to live each day...

Each minute. . .
as best as we can.

So should we start now?

Oh! Oh look at it!!

It's just as beautiful
as I remembered.

So are you.

Even more beautiful than when we
first came here.

<i>Whoa').!</i>

Whoa! No! No!!

Oh-oh-oh!!

No!! No!!!

I've had such wonderful moments
with you.

Oh, I just wish we could
make time. . .stop...

Stay like this forever.

I love you, sweetheart.

Oh. . . Hm?

L. . .I'd better
see to Kyle.

I think he's crying.

Honey?

Oh, please God, help her.

God, why is this happening?

Bye, Mom.

<i>I'm</i> gonna <i>to go
to school now.</i>

All right, Grace.

I'm. . .your daughter, Teri.

This one right here.

Teri.

Yeah, and that's Kyle.

Kyle.

Yeah.

<i>L</i> gotta go-

I'll see you
this afternoon.

Aw...

Are you feeling good,
Mrs. Brighton?

You want to get up
and get dressed?

No! No! No! No! No! No!

No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

It's all right.

He's coming back
in a little while.

Maybe I better not go just yet.

You go ahead,
Mr. Brighton...

No!!!!

...it's important you have some
time for yourself.

<i>Go on now.</i>

No! No! No! No!

He's coming back
in a little while.

He's coming back
in a little while.

Oh, God help me.

I'm sorry. . .You okay?

Sorry, just resting.

Oh, I thought you
were. . .Well...

Having a heart attack
or something?

Does it look
like I should be?

No, it's not that,
I see you running here

every once in a while
but you're not very regular.

Keeping track, eh?

I just happened to notice.

It's hard to do it every day.

Oh, yeah, I heard.

Heard what?

Oh well, nothin',
it's just that...

What?

Well, I heard that
the legs are the first to go.

Really?

The next to go is
your sense of humor.

Julia Sinclair

John Brighton.

Jingle bell swing

Oh, right time

it's the right time

Hello.

Hi.

You all right?

Just bubbling
with happiness.

How's Mom?

On a scale of one to ten,
about a minus 4.

How's Dad
holding up?

You mean that guy who wanders
through here every now and then?

Wouldn't know--
hardly ever see him.

This isn't a family anymore, it's an
asylum.

And I get to live here. . .
lucky me.

Look, dad's doing
the best he can.

I saw him this week
for about 10 minutes

and last week I got 15.

Mom thinks
I'm her cousin, Grace.

I don't have parents anymore.

I might as well be a boarder.

And it's Christmas, Kyle,

do you see any decorations?

Do you see any cookies?

Dad hasn't even had time to go out
and buy presents.

There won't be
a Christmas this year--

maybe it's for the best.

I mean, why fake it?

Okay, pitiful,
let's go.

What?

I said, let's go.

What are you talking about?

Come on.

Leave me alone. No!

No, you're coming--
we've got work to do.

You're crazy! You belong
in this family.

I know.

Hey-he!!!

Hey Dad,
how are you?

Hey Mom,
how's it goin'?

Ellen, it's Kyle.

Oh, hello.

Hi, Mom.

You look great!

When did you get home?

A little while ago.

You ready squirt?

Ready.

What's going on here?

Ah, you'll see.

Okay,
let her rip.

Oh, I don't believe that.

Oh!!!

Thank you...

Both of you.

God bless us, everyone.

Mom, do you want
some hot chocolate?

You're not going to
blow a fuse, are you?

How many amps
you got going?

Dad, don't worry about it.

Okay, if you say so.

I'll tell you
what to worry about.

Hmmm?

Teri's planning to cook Christmas
dinner

oh, no.

Oh, yeah,
and God help us-- everyone.

Like trying to put the windows up
with the heater on

we're going 75.

My hair-- ruining...

You have this scarf on.

Anyway it was nothing. I mean, in
Florida when it's raining

you put the windows up...

You guys need to know that Teri
is the mastermind

behind this entire dinner.

So she's worked really hard
and we need to thank her.

Okay, ladies and gentlemen...

Teri's grand opus. . .
Is served!

It's nice when someone lends you
a hand in the kitchen.

Well, let's all
give thanks, shall we?

You know, I'd like
to say something first

if it's okay.
sure, fine.

Well, um...

Last night I asked Cindy
to marry me...

<i>And she said yesâ€œ!</i>

All right!
I finally get a sister.

Blessings on both of you.

Thank you Alexander.

I didn't realize things had gotten <i>so</i>
serious.

I know, dad.
you've been <i>so</i> busy

we haven't had
time to tell you.

Welcome, Cindy.

Wow!!

Congratulations.

When's the wedding?

Well, um...

As soon as possible!

Welcome to the family.

Thank you.
welcome!

Something to think about.

Don't get any ideas.

We certainly have a lot to be
thankful for this year.

You' re absolutely right.

Let's pray.

Oh!!

Father on this Christmas day,

we want to thank you
for all these gifts of joy.

For our children,
Kyle and Teri...

Everybody told me
not to marry him

but I was stubborn.

I knew better...

Or <i>so</i> I thought.

I' m sorry, Julia.

Thanks, I appreciate
your listening.

You don't interrupt
the way my cockatiel does.

Once the legs are gone, what can
you do but sit and listen?

Oop!!

Woop!

You ruin everything!!

These are my favorite lipsticks.

How did you do this?

Look what she did.

Everything is
completely ruined!

Honey, it's
all right.

Let me take care
of this.

Mrs. Brighton, don't you
like your breakfast?

You need to eat.

Oh, you're looking for
your husband aren't you?

You don't like it
when he's gone.

But everything is
going to be just fine.

He's away on
a little business trip

and he'll be back
tomorrow night.

Tomorrow night.

It's pretty isn't it?
you like it?

I'll be right back, I'm just going to
fold some clothes.

Teacher.

Teacher.

The. . .teacher, teacher.

Senora??

Senora!!!!

Mrs. Brighton!

Mrs. Brighton!

Mrs. Brighton!

Mrs. Brighton.

<i>Ay dios mio!!</i>

We at Brighton Associates are

pleased to have
the opportunity

to brief you
on the progress

of our southwest
corridor explorations.

We first chartered
this region...

Come on.

...number 630
in your prospectus.

If you'll turn
to page 16.

Before we get
into all that

I would like an explanation
as to why

this briefing has been repeatedly
rescheduled.

I'm glad you asked about that and
it is something we...

How far behind schedule are we?

Well. . .Well you
have to understand.

Southwest corridor has
never exactly

been explored before so...

Aaahh!!

Exactly--
the southwest corridor is

a very hazardous, cavernous
region of the ocean.

Mr. Brighton,
it's for you.

A family emergency.

You and Stephanie will have to run
the meeting without me.

John, that's impossible, they want to
hear from you!!

<i>I have no choice.</i>

You do have
a choice.

Yeah, you tell me--
what is it?

Are the police
looking for her?

I assume so.

Well fine, they'll
take it from here.

I mean, what
can you do?

Look, we have 2 hours in
there and we've got 'em.

You can't get there
in 2 hours anyway.

I've got to go home.
I have no other choice.

It's funny how this company

never seems to be on
your list of choices.

How do you think
they liked it?

Are you kidding?
you did a nice job.

Thanks for pinch-hitting.

No problem.

I can't believe John
just bails on us like that.

Ellen was missing.

It's not like he could have
done anything about it.

I'm sure she's glad she
married John and not you.

She would have been in
a nursing home a long time ago.

That's right.

Jeremy, keep reading, quiet.

If you finish up this lesson
you guys get to go to recess.

Psst! Mrs. Edwards.

May I help you?

Take your seats.

Take your seats, class.

Take your seats.

Matthew, please go
get Mrs. Dewey.

Who knows the question?

NO! No!

Take your seats.

Take your seats.

Take your seats.

Ellen...

Take your seat.

Ellen, it's me-- Valerie.

Take your seat.
take your seats.

Take your seats.

Ellen, why don't you
come into my office?

Take your seats.

We could sit down. No!!!

We could sit. . . No! No! No!

Teach! No! No! No!

Teach! Teach!

Teach! Teach!

Oh, Mr. Brighton,
I'm <i>so</i> sorry.

I went to the laundry room
for just one minute

and she was gone.
I'm <i>so</i> sorry.

It's all right, Maria.

Ellen...

Hmmm.

I'm <i>so</i> glad you're safe.

She's okay.

Well I'm not!

I can't take this anymore.

I'm sorry Teri,
we're all trying.

Every day I think the <i>chaos</i> can't
get any worse.

And it does.

People keep telling me

there's nothing more
I can do for my wife

that she doesn't even know
who I am anymore.

I should put her away
in a nursing home.

But sometimes she does
know who I am,

I can see it
in her eyes.

I'm sorry to be dumping
all this on you

but having someone to talk to just
means <i>so</i> much to me.

No, it's okay.

I love to hear you talk.

Oh.

This time
that we spend together,

well, it's just about
the high point of my day.

I really appreciate
your friendship.

You don't return phone calls.

You don't return phone calls.

You cancel meetings
at the last minute.

You're not available
for consultation.

Every time it happens you
apologize, but nothing changes.

Aren't you the one who's
always preaching

about how repentance is some
sort of change of conduct?

I'll change; the company
will change. We'll rebound.

Rebound?

Yesterday Robin
and Doug resigned.

This morning <i>3</i> sales guys--
you call that rebounding?

Um, excuse me.

May I help you?

Is John Brighton here?

The word's on
the street John,

the accounts are
getting jittery,

the sharks are circling!

I'll make some calls.

That's not enough.

I need you here every day,
I need your word on it.

How am I going to do that
with Ellen the way she is?

You put her in a home
for people like that.

Come on, John,
you're young, get a life.

She's not people like that!
She's my wife.

I love her!

John, Ellen's dying.

There's nothing you
can do about that.

Please, just go.

Hello.

Hi. Hi John!

Julia.

Oh, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

Oh, excuse me. Phil, Julia Sinclair,
my brother, Phil.

Hi. Nice to meet you.
nice to meet you.

I was right around the corner.

I wondered if you were
free for lunch.

Sure.

And you're
with...

Julia's ah, just a friend.

Oh. . .Oh,
just a friend.

Have a nice lunch.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

I can't say I blame him.

If it was anyone but family,

I'd a gotten the boot
a long time ago.

I'm <i>so</i> sorry.

What are you going to do?

I don't know.

So much of what I did was
for Ellen and our future.

Your future isn't over.

Would Ellen want you to
give up your life for her?

She loved you.

I know what a woman wants
for the man she loves,

she wants you to go on and be
even more successful...

For yourself
and Kyle and Teri.

You're such a giving man.

You think about everybody
but yourself.

But John. . .
I'm thinking about you.

If you ever
need anything...

I'm here for you.

Cindy and I have been praying
about this for a long time.

We set the date for our wedding.

It's a week after graduation.

That' s great.

Congratulations.

I'm happy for you son.

Just wish things could
have been different,

we haven't had
much time to talk.

I wanted to be there for you.

Make sure you were
ready for this.

Don't worry Dad.

Cindy and I have learned more
about marriage

from watching you and Mom than
you could ever put into words.

Let's go for another set.

John!?

Her name is Julia Sinclair.

She's become a. . .
a dear friend.

She's amazing.

She listens endlessly
to my whining.

I'm just <i>so</i> lonely, Alexander.

I try to remember what it felt like
to have Ellen

put her arms around me,
kiss me...

But the memory's fading.

Every morning I see Julia
and I'm alive.

I'm afraid I'm falling
in love with her.

I love Ellen...

But I just...

Sometimes I can't stand the thought
of holding her hand

and just being
<i>so</i> completely alone.

Loneliness can be
a terrible thing.

I know-- I'm an expert.

There was a time I thought I had a
loneliness problem,

same as you're feeling now.

I know the signs.

But, John, you haven't got
a loneliness problem,

I think the issue
for you is trust.

Are you free tomorrow night?

I suppose so. . .Why?

You'll have to
trust me on this.

All right?

I remember that night
in temple terrace.

God was speaking to my heart--
I knew that.

God was speaking to my heart--
I knew that.

And I remember getting
on my knees

on the 18th hole of
the golf course and I said,

"Oh, God. . .l give in.

"I never wanted
to be a preacher.

"I never wanted to be
anything in the church.

"I didn't like the church,

but I'll be what
you want me to be

"and I'll do what
you want me to do."

And that call has never left
and God has said,

"I want you to continue as long
as I give you the strength."

The voice was <i>so</i> distinct

that I couldn't misunderstand that
call.

And every Christian is
called to ministry.

Did you know that?

The word ministry
means servant, service.

With a call to do
something for other people

that are less fortunate
than we are.

Jesus took on himself the form of
a servant, the Bible says.

He said, "I did not come
to be served, but to serve."

In Mark 10.

It's tough to do
the will of God.

We have the highest standard
of living in the world.

The highest standard that
the world has ever known.

And yet as a nation
we're in danger

of leaving God out of our lives.

Oh, please, God, forgive me--

forgive me for trying
to do all this on my own.

I need you Lord...

Now more than ever.

The devil will always have
a ship ready

when a man wants
to sail away from God.

You see God gave his son,
Jesus Christ,

You see God gave his son,
Jesus Christ,

to die on that <i>cross</i> for you.

That's the reason
he was there...

John?...

Are you all right?

Yeah!

I've got to go
home, Alexander.

I have some things
I need to do.

Sure...

<i>Let'</i> S

Sweetheart...

Sweetheart...

I know it's been a while,

but I have
something to tell you.

Something to remind you of,

because, well, I was reminded
of it myself tonight.

Let's see...

Been a long time.

I, John, take you, Ellen,

to be my wife.

To have and to hold.

To honor and to treasure.

To be at your side

through sorrow and joy,

in sickness and in health.

To love and cherish you always.

I promise you this

from my heart...

With my soul...

For as long
as we both shall live.

This is my promise to you.

You know, up until now

I thought of taking care of you as
a chore.

But I want you to know,

taking care of you is

an honor. . .a privilege.

This bed. . .
Is my altar, Lord.

And on it is the woman I love.

I give her into your hands.

Well, hi.

Hi.

Come on in.

Thanks.

I'm sorry to
surprise you like this.

Oh no, it's fine.

I have a feeling we're not going to
be running together anymore.

Isn't it strange?

It was your faithfulness
that drew me to you

and now your faithfulness
is taking you away.

John. . .Hi.

Phil, I'm sorry
to bother you.

I just wanted to stop by
and tell you, I am <i>so</i> sorry.

You are absolutely right.

About what?

About me holding the firm back.

I've giving it a lot of a thought and
I understand now,

you were right about it and the
only solution is for me

to give you my share--
controlling interest.

What are you
talkin' about?

I've given it
a lot of thought

and I just think it's
best for all concerned.

So, I just wanted
you to know that.

So I'm sorry I disturbed
you and...

Michelle.

Michelle. . .Hi.

Hello.

So, anyway,
have a nice day.

Who was that?

I think it was
my former partner.

Well, I'm glad you
all could make it.

There's been a few changes here
at Brighton Associates.

We have good news and
we have more good news.

The good news is we're not going
to have anymore problems

with John bailing on meetings and
scaring away clients.

What did you do,
hide his pager?

Not exactly.

He stepped down
from the company.

What?
what?

You've got to be kidding us.

So what's the
more good news?

The more good news. . .
Is that I'm in charge now.

Ah. . .no offense, Phil,

but without John,
I'm not sure we can make it.

Without John?
give me a break.

He hasn't been here
for the last <i>3</i> months.

Come on guys.
we'll be fine!

Where's the old
company spirit here?

Who's going to handle
the European clients?

It took John <i>3</i> years to get them
to sign those contracts.

And they won't even
talk to you, pal.

I'll send them flowers.

Is anybody
hot in here?

Look, I'm with you, Phil,

but I'm not sure we're going to be
able to convince the others.

We'll convince them.

We have to.

I see the laundry truck
has arrived.

Hi, uncle Phil.
how's it going?

Okay. ls your dad here?

No. Why, what's wrong?

Nothin' .

Actually, plenty.

Why?

Your dad turned over the controlling
interest

in the company to me.

Really?

Yeah, really.

It's been a disaster.

I thought that's what
you always wanted.

Yeah, he just dumped everything on
me and split.

The whole office staff is nervous,
some of them have quit.

I'm afraid
if I tell the clients,

I'm going to lose a lot more
than just employees.

He knows how valuable he is
to this company,

he can't just do this.

Look, Dad's been under
a lot of pressure lately

with Mom and everything.

There's a lot of professional people
and places

that can do a much better job
of taking care of your mom

than your dad has.

You haven't even
seen him with her.

Are they going to put 1 1/2
teaspoons of honey in her tea,

just the way she likes it?

Are they going to read to her out
of the Bible

and brush her hair every night?

Do they even know what her
favorite color is?

Look, uncle Phil,
I love you a lot.

I always have and I always will

and I appreciate the things you've
tried to tell me

about life but, you got
to understand something--

my father,
he lives every day

according to the principles
of the Bible.

Now, I know that doesn't
mean anything to you,

but I gotta ask you...

What principles
do you live by?

If you want to find Dad,

he's probably at Alexander's.

And <i>so</i> I did what
you said, Alexander,

I let go of everything
I could think of...

And I let go of Ellen.

I gave her over to God.

I feel. . .peace.

Thanks, Alexander.

Hi, Alexander.

Phil. . .l didn't know
you were here.

Well, I heard John
spilling his guts,

I didn't think
I should interrupt.

Man, what is
going on with him?

He let go of the business,
he let go of Julia,

he let go of Ellen.

He doesn't have
anything left.

I mean, how do you get peace
by letting go of everything?

I thought you get peace
by having everything.

Well, it's easy enough
to understand,

but not <i>so</i> easy
when you try and do it.

You know, I think what matters is
to recognize that it takes

someone bigger than ourselves
to help us find true peace.

We weren't designed
to do it alone.

So how does
John do it?

He finally recognized
that God was fully capable

of handling anything
we give him to handle

and that there is no true peace
without that step.

I thought God helps those
who help themselves.

How can he if you're too busy
handling things yourself?

You see, God loves us <i>so</i> much,

he gave his only son,
Jesus Christ,

to die in our place.

Then he raised him
from the dead

to prove that he was his son

and to show us that
we too could have eternal life.

If he's willing to do all that without
any help from us,

why should he want to see us
carry our other burdens?

I don't know.

Well, he doesn't want us
to carry them.

And the good news is,
we don't have to.

He's more than capable
of managing our lives

if we just let him.

But we need to acknowledge
that we need him

and then learn to trust him,

to believe in him--
let him take control.

Invite him to be
the Lord of your life.

So, is that
what John did?

Uh-hm.

Is that how he got that
peace he was talking about?

That' s how.

You want some of that?

Sounds like too good
of a deal.

It's always about the deal.

But you know-- you're right!

It is a good deal.

Phil, why don't you go on
back in the <i>woods</i>

and talk to the Lord.

Let him take controlling interest in
your life.

Begin to feel his power at work.

Listen to Phil, Lord,

just like you listened
to John and to me

<i>so</i> many times.

God, are you there?

Can you hear me?

I think I need you, Lord.

I'm getting really tired
of doing this on my own.

I'm just tired of being
a control freak, God

and telling everybody
what to do all the time.

Just forgive me, God.

Forgive me for being <i>so</i>
self-centered and...

Just such a jerk.

Forgive me for that,
will ya?

Could you do that?

Just change me, Jesus.

Okay?

I give you controlling interest.

Just come and take control
of my life.

Will ya?

And give me peace.

I just give it to you.

Is that a deal?

Have I got a deal, Lord?

Deal!!

It's a good deal!

The test was pretty hard.

I hate chemistry and when
I'm done with this class,

I'm never getting near it again.

But there is this guy in the class
I-l kinda like him.

He's cute, but I don't even think he
knows I exist.

But. . .college is <i>so</i> different.

But lately, I was thinking about
even getting into teaching

'cuz I-I remembered how much
it really meant to you

and it's. . .it's kind...

Teri...

I. . .Love. . .You.

Mommy...

You know who I am.

I love you too.

Mom...

I'm going to go get
Kyle and Dad,

I'll be right back, Mom.

John!

Ellen!

Mom!! Ellen!!

Mom!!

Ellen, honey...

Ellen?

She looked
right at me.

She said my name.

It's all right.

Maybe it was God's gift to you.

Looks like you finally found
the studs to that shirt.

Got a little class
working for you there

just like your
little brother.

Thanks.

You know, John, we ah,

we want you back
at the firm.

I want you back
as controlling partner.

Now you don't have
to answer to me right now,

I. . .l know you got a lot
on your mind and stuff.

There is one other thing
I want to clear up.

I ah...

I need you to forgive me--
for the way I acted,

for ah...

Putting the company
ahead of Ellen.

Will you forgive me
for that?

I, Kyle, take you, Cindy,
to be my beloved wife.

To have and to hold you,

to honor and treasure you,

to be by your side
in sorrow and in joy,

in sickness and in health,

to love and cherish you always.

I promise you this
with my heart,

with my soul...

As long as we both shall live.

This is my promise to you.

Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it?
