[Girl on TV]
You need to talk to your dad.

Ow!

Okay. Okay.

He's not an ogre, ass!

[Girl #2 on TV]
Gee! All right.
I'll talk to him tonight.

Wow.

That's, like, my favorite
right shoulder, ever, I think.

Oh, my God!
It is.

Are you, like, 13?

That's not gonna work.
And besides,

John's gonna be down here
any moment.

No. No, he's not.
We have at least 20 minutes.

I work with the guy.
I've seen it firsthand.

He's one of those clean-freak,
bathroom-phobic types
who take forever.

And even if he didn't,
we're newlyweds, right?

He'll understand.

Still, clean-freak or not,
I hardly want to be the topic

of workplace conversation.

Cubicle conversation
can only go so far.

[toilet flushes]

I win.
[door opens]

John, John, John,
did I mention you'll be, um,

paying for dinner?

[keypad beeping]

[alarm beeping]

Don't beep at me,
you stupid alarm.

The doors are locked.

Well, babe, will you
go check all the doors?

Please, please, please,
please, please?

[lock clicking]

I know where the key is.

[sweater rips]
Oh! Oh, shoot!

Marge, you don't happen to have
your knitting needles with you,
do you?

I gave up making

and started buying
for that very reason.

Oh, once one thread rips,
the rest will follow.

I just know it.

Why don't you go out
and buy a new sweater
so that doesn't happen?

Buy one?

We don't get paid
till next week,

and my Social Security
don't cover more

than the pantyhose
on my ass.

Bertha, you said
the A-double-S word
in the library.

What's the matter, Marge?

I say a lot of things
in the library

you don't know about.

Next week.
I can't believe I forgot that.

Why, honey,
you need some money?

No. I just didn't
want you to worry.

After these,
you can go.

Why are you always so sad?

You know,
it isn't polite to stare.

Uh, I wasn't staring.

Oh, really?

Then what the fuck
was that thing you were
just doing with your eyes?

You know, that thing where
you wouldn't take them off

those two comatose-looking
people over there?

That's right. Staring.
And it isn't polite.

Especially when they might
be trying to steal something.



[blows raspberry]

Hungry for a Papa-Go
Park Picnic Meal?

How much?
Five bucks.

How much for
just the hot dog?

Three bucks.
Hmm.

What, the library now sends
its stupid little shelf-stuffers

to get stolen books back?

No.

What?


I--

I just followed you.

What the fuck?
Are you a pervert?

Are you gonna tell my boss?

No. Not if you tell me
why you followed me,

Alex.

How do you know my name?

After you buy something--

ugh--

make sure it's securely
back in your pocket.

Leave it out like you did,
it's easy to steal.

So?

Don't you look at her

and want to know why
she's like that?

Why she's close
to that dog, but...

recoils from people

like they're the ones
who are going to bite?

Is he really that cool,

or is it an act?

If it's an act, why?

Or this couple in the library--
the Smiths.

They have this routine.

They come in every month

and check out
the same book.

And every time they come in,
they're sad.

Why?

You know,
when I was a little girl,

I used to have a cat.

What happened to it?

Um...

curiosity ran it over.

Blood and guts were everywhere.
It was really disgusting,
actually.

I-- I have to go.

Okay. I'll just
follow you, then.


I'm sorry.

Didn't mean to mess up
your nice shit.

Well, if you ever need
a hot girl for a roommate,
just let me know.

I'll move right in.

Where's the fam?

Why'd you steal
the book?

You didn't tell me.

Well, that wasn't
part of the deal,

but, um, 'cause of my dad.

To win an argument
I had with him.

He's one of those doctors
who refuses to believe

people are actually
how they want to be.

Yeah, shit happens
that fucks them up, but...
I don't know.

Either they wanna get better
or they don't.
It's their choice.

But when they get
with people like him,

it doesn't happen.
Why?

'Cause now they're hooked
on stupid gimmicks.

Told to find out what their
real problem is when they
knew it in the first place.

They just couldn't
fucking face it.

Now they're looking
for different solutions.

Shit that isn't possible,
but, um,

'cause of people like him,
they're convinced it is.

That's why you steal books?

I steal whatever.

I figured since I was
his daughter

and so clearly fine,

he would have to know
there's no bigger issue.

So what happened?

Now I'm addicted
to stealing shit.

But whatever. Who cares?

I won...I think.

Well, I wouldn't
have known that

if I hadn't followed you.

Why are they back the next day?

Oh, my. You really
like this one, huh?

I can probably
special order it if you like.

No. We like
to come and get it.

It gets us
out of the house.

[Mr. Smith]
Actually, this will be
the last time we check it out.

I think we've finally
had our fill.

Right, honey?

[footsteps approaching]

[Mr. Smith]
Where are you going?
Shh.

What's wrong?

Honey?
Nothing.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

[Mr. Smith]
Have a good day.
You, too. Bye.

Breathe, Alice, breathe.

It's been a year.

You have to try.

You can't keep doing this.



[Mr. Smith]
What? What's going on?

Honey, what's wrong?

Are you okay?

Honey, what?
What happened?

[Mrs. Smith]
I thought I saw him.

[Mr. Smith]
It will stop, honey.
You know it will.

When?

We have taken a big step
this week, and the rest
will follow.

By packing him away
like one of your sports cards?

By erasing any evidence
that he was ever here?

That is not a first step.
Then what is?

You tell me.
What is a first step, Alice?

Because I would really
like to know.

Doing nothing?
Never changing?

I didn't say that.
Well, then, what--

what are you saying?

What are you saying?

It's hard.
You don't understand.

I'll tell you what
I don't understand, Alice.

I don't understand
why you keep going in there.

I don't understand why you
keep cleaning his laundry

again and again.

I don't understand why you
keep torturing yourself...
No! No!

Yes! Yes! Yes!
No, you cannot touch the...

No! You have your
stupid office closet.

I have this.

What? You think I don't know
what you do in there?

Why you miss your deadlines?
Hey, at least I'm still working.

Oh, that's right.

Me going back to the flower
shop's gonna solve everything,
isn't it?

Not everything.
It's just...


I'm sorry.

I--I thought
this was my house.

I--I got lost.
I'm sorry.

Wait!

Eat as much
as you want.

There's a week's worth
in the fridge.

Why didn't you call
the police?

You reminded me of my son.

Oh, yeah?

How old is he?
Is he home?

He's dead.

It was a terrible disease.

Your parents are dead,
too, aren't they?

I can see it in your eyes.

I have to go.

Thanks for the food
and for not calling the cops.

I don't know
how this happened.

It looked like my house
from outside.

Would you like
to see his picture?

This is Timmy
before he got sick.

Uh, he was 16 there.

He was actually much bigger
than he looks in that photo.

[alarm beeps]

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm supposed to watch
my Dr. Alred videos now.

Is that okay?

Yeah, it's fine.

[TV on]

[Dr. Alred on TV]
Hello, and welcome back.

I hope you've seen
some progress within yourself

since last we spoke.

If so, you're one step further
in this terrible journey

known as
the five stages of grief.

And what one are we on?

Depression.

I want you to think
about your loved one

and recall one happy memory.

But don't get sad
about what isn't.

Instead, celebrate what was
and cherish that.

If you can do this,
then you are ready.

But if you can't, then you
need to restart this disc

and reflect on exactly
why you're feeling

the way you are.

Which one, honey? There are
so many to choose from.

It's up to you.

Ah. I got it.
The perfect one.

This will tell you the kind of
crazy imagination Timmy had.

He was, uh--
He was about eight,

and he had just gotten home
from a sleepover

where they had stayed
up all night watching
scary movies, and--

Not this one.

But it's a good one.
Please?

Do what you want.

[door closes]

He, um--

He acts like he doesn't like
to talk about Timmy, but...

I know what he does
in his office.

What was the movie?

Well, it was, uh...

It was one of those
monster ones.

You know,
where they steal you away,
take over your body.

I can't remember.
Something like that.

But what I do remember
was the look on his face.

He was so scared
that his little eyes

trembled as he watched me
in the garden.

Finally, he said, "Mommy,

are the monsters gonna come
and take me away?"

And I said, "Sweetheart,
if they exist, no,
they're not gonna do that."

But Timmy, always more
concerned with others,

he said, "Well, if they do,
don't worry,

"'cause I'll come back
just like in the movie.

"But I probably won't
remember you,

"because nobody in the movie
ever remembered anything.

That's just
the way it works."

And I told him that
it would be okay if he didn't,

because we would always
remember him.

[Dr. Alred on TV]
Did you pass?

If so, before you move on
to "acceptance,"

you need to select a hobby
that will help occupy you

during this phase.
[TV off]

Some TV sound good?

I should probably go.

Just for a while?

Okay.

Okay.
[TV on]

[Man on TV]
Oh, come on in.

[birds chirping]
[lawnmower whirring]

What am I still
doing here?

I should've left
last night.

I had to be home
by 10:00.

Don't be mad.
You fell asleep.

I-I didn't wanna
wake you up.

It's not like me.

Well, maybe you weren't
in such a hurry

to get home after all.



You look awful.

I was, uh...

I was up all night
trying to make my deadline.

It's weird, isn't it?

Weird?
He looks just like him.

I'm, uh--
I'm sorry.

I'm just...
I'm sorry.

Uh, listen, I really need
to finish this up, and, so...

I was almost done
when these stupid boxes fell.

They just fell?

Mark, come on out.
Please?

He's about to leave,
and it'd be nice
if you said good-bye.

I brought you
some lunch.

You look like
you don't eat so much,
so I thought it wouldn't hurt.

It's turkey.

Thanks.

Nice meeting you.

You can eat it here.

Do you wanna
eat it here?

I have to go to work,
or else I would.

You would?

Does that mean that you'll
come by again...and help us?

Help you?

Well, not like yard work
or anything.

Just come by and say hi,
watch TV, anything.

Can I hug you?

You--

You wanna hug me?

Yes.

[Dr. Alred on TV]
Hello, I'm Dr. Alred.

This must be
a very trying time.

You have to remember that
what you're feeling is normal.

Anyone who encounters
such tragedy

goes through
these very feelings.

It's called
the process of grief.

And believe me,
it's not pretty,

and it's not easy,
but, thankfully,

[muting continues]
you've made the first step
by purchasing this program.

In this disc,
we're gonna tackle

the fist stage of grief...
[continues, indistinct]

[tires screeching, horn honks]

[vehicle departing]

Hello? Alex?

Open up!

It's Josie!

Remember me,
the girl you followed?

I'm really hot.
[car approaching]

** [rock on car stereo]

You better be here.
I kidnapped your horsey.

He's so lonely.
You should see his face.

He needs your love.

Neigh!

Neigh!
[clicking tongue]

Okay, you fucker.

If you're just gonna ignore me,
I'm gonna have to wait out here
in the hot, hot sun...

with my shirt off.

Oh...

The breeze feels so good
on my naked boobs.

Hey, sleepyhead.

I was afraid
you weren't gonna wake up.

You've been asleep
for two days.

You're gonna be
a little tender for a while.

The car that hit you got away,
but lucky for you,
we were right there.

What's wrong with me?

When the car
slammed into you,

it hit your legs.

By the time we got to you,
your knees were already swollen.

We did the best we could,
but we're not gonna know
if they're broken

until the swelling
goes down.

Am I in the hospital?
No.

We're gonna
take care of you.

We-We've done it before.

For Timmy.

He, um...

He had osteoporosis.
Do you know what that is?

Never mind.
Of course you do.

You're a smarty-pants.

It was, um--

It was a rare case.

No one caught it
until it was too late.

He, um--

He fell on the field.

His legs buckled back,
one under the other.

And afterwards,
he couldn't walk,
much like you,

but his bones never healed.

They were too ravaged

all through his body.

After he was bedridden,

the rest of his diseased bones
just wasted away...

until it became too--

too dangerous to put...

weight on any one bone.

So we learned
to take care of him until...

We took care of him...

just like we're gonna
take care of you.

You rest, okay?

He can't stay here.

He has no one else,
remember?

We can take him to the hospital
like I wanted to two days ago.

Mark, he has no money,
no health insurance,

and no one
to take care of him.

We can.
We can help.

No,

we can't.

Yes, we can.

We've been given
a second chance.

To do what?
To do things right.

To not screw it up
like we did before.

We beat ourselves up
every day

over what we would've
done differently.

Now we don't have to.

I'm sorry
you can't see that.

[door opens]

Has the swelling
gone down?

Not much. No.

Dad? Mom?

It's okay. We're right here.
What do you need, sweetie?

I don't need anything.
I'm sorry.

Don't apologize
and don't feel bad.

I, um--
I started to bring in

a couple of Timmy's things
to make you more comfortable.

Do you like it?

Was that
his favorite team?

That's where he wanted to play,
wasn't it, Mark?

Yes.

I need to get up.

I don't think
that's such a good idea.

All right. Like I said,
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Listen to me. All right?
Now, I let you have
your tough-guy moment.

That's the last one
you get, okay? All right.

We'll get you out of here.
Honey, you're gonna
take the lower part.

We've done this before, okay?
We're gonna do it on three.

Put your arm around
my shoulder. Okay.

One, two, three.

[groans, sighs]

When is this gonna stop?
I'd imagine soon.

I don't think you have
anything left to throw up.

Okay, I'm back.
Here we go.

Here we go.

Honey, let me in there.

[toilet flushes]

Okay.

Here we go.

Oh, you got it
all over your legs.

Uh, they won't move.

I can't move them.

That's--That's nothing
to worry about.

The swelling just has to
go down on your knees.

That'll take about a week,
and then, eventually,

you'll regain motion,
and you'll be able
to walk again.

I'll tell you what.
Um, what's today?

Sunday.

You get better
by next Sunday,

and I'll make you
a very special meal.

How's that sound?

But right now,
you gotta get cleaned up,

'cause you're starting
to smell like Mark

after a long day
at the office,

which is not pleasant.

Shouldn't he be done by now?

Calm down.

We gave him clean clothes,
put him in the wheelchair.

He said he would call
when he was ready.

You know me.
If I don't have something
to keep myself occupied,

my mind wanders.

Now, that's
an understatement.

Oh, really?

Yes.
You're like a child.


Well, would a--
would a child do this?







I'm sorry.
I, uh...

I just need, uh, help
putting on my shorts.


Okay.
Oh.

Actually,

Mark, I need some help
in the bathroom, too.

Uh, yeah, sure.

[wheel squeaking]

Hmm.

I think that's
just 'cause it--

it hasn't been used
in a while.

There. That's better.

Speak for yourself.
What did you do to his hair?

I didn't...
It was me.

I couldn't find
a brush.

Out.
You've done your part.

So how do you like it?
And before you say no, think.

It's not wise to disappoint
a mother with a brush.

Especially one who
takes hair so seriously.

How it was before.

Well, at least you don't have
that West Nile thing

Marge has been going
on and on about.

No, it's nothing like that.

I didn't mean
to make you worry.

This flu just made me
sleep through everything.

I should be better
for Monday.
No problem.

We brought Marco in
from downtown to cover for you.

Okay. Bye.

Thanks for dialing for me.
Of course.

If you need anything,
we're right on the other side
of this wall.

And, well,
just to warn you, sweetie,

sometimes...

Well, this is gonna sound silly,
but sometimes I can't sleep,

and I--I find myself

sitting outside this door.

It comforts me.

So if you wake up
and you hear or see anyone,

it's just me.

You think that's weird?

No.

Um, sometimes I can't sleep
because of the quiet.

I have to read myself
to sleep.

Do you think that's weird?

No.

That's the first real thing
you've shared with me, Alex.

I'm glad we're
at that stage now.

Good night.

I think these are worse off
than when you gave them to me.

Men.

Let me show you.

Nothing is worse off

after someone
has cared for it.

Those were.

Nothing.

Timmy was the same
at first.

He sat out here complaining,
but he got good,

just like you will.

That's where he would sit
and watch you, wasn't it?

Yes.

So what does Mark do?

Um, he writes for
a sports Web site.

He used to write
for a bigger column,

but he switched
to a smaller one

so that he could write
from here and take care
of me.

He doesn't get a lot
of writing done.

Mostly,
he just keeps himself

locked up in that
damn office closet,

which is off-limits to me.

Mark?

I'm not in there.

Uh, Alice said
you were looking for me.

I thought you might be.

All right. Are you right
or left-handed?

Right-handed.
Okay.

So, that's what
your grip looks like.

Bring it up to your ear.

As you throw,
it comes off like that.

Did we miss anything?

Beginning credits
just ended.

[Woman on TV]
I'm Miss Childs,

and I'll be filling in
as your substitute.

You pick first, sweetie.

I can choose
whatever I want?

Monopoly.

Monopoly?

Monopoly's perfect.

I know.

Oh!
No, no, no, no.

Seven, eight, nine!
[all laugh]

[Man on TV]
See you later.

Honey, maybe you can go to
New York for graduate school.

[TV continues, indistinct]



Is all that prodding you do
to him really necessary?

Stretching is essential
if he's gonna get any better.

Not if it's gonna hurt him,
and that hurts him.

Okay, then, what else
do you want me to do?
Magically heal him?

I'd like you to be
a little more careful.

When have I
not been careful?

I'm not gonna
argue about this.

Really, when have I
not been careful?

They don't look that much
different from yesterday.

But they feel it.
I mean, I can probably get up
and walk right now.

No, sweetie.
You're not ready.

Let's wait until tomorrow
as planned,

and if they still feel
this good, we'll get you up.

But with crutches.

Yeah.

Alex! I'm home!

Did you hear? That was me
breaking the fuck in!

You're lucky it wasn't your face
for making me come back here
for days!

Neigh.

** [rock]

Fine.
I'm just gonna wait here

until you decide
to man up and come out
from wherever you're hiding.

You pussy.

I bet I'm the first girl
you ever had in your bed.

Disgusting.

You know,
you don't have to leave.

Even after you're better,
you can stay.

I'll still make you
your special meal.

I just wanna finish this.

You've been pushing me away
all day. Why?

I have to finish it.

You don't have
to do anything.

We would never make you do
something you didn't wanna do.

Well, you're not
my parents.

Tell me about them.

I don't remember them.

Everybody remembers
their parents.

Not me.

Well, don't you think
that's a little weird?

Are you sure you're not
mad at me about something?

Look, please just
leave me alone.

I'm out of here tomorrow,
and then you don't have
to worry about me.

It's gonna be okay.

No, Mark.

Just let me think.

What's going on?

He doesn't remember them.

Why don't you sit down
at the table

and have some dinner, Alex?

I'm not hungry.
Fine.

You wanna talk to us
about this report card, then?

What is it gonna take
for you to get off my back,
fucking die?

You're horrible, awful.

Only an awful person
would say such a thing.

Get back here, Alex.
[door opens]

Get back in this house, Alex!
[door closes]

Mom? Dad?

Dad? Mom?

It's okay, honey.
You're okay. Let it out.

No, not this time.

Let me go.
No.

I don't like to let things
that are good out of my life.
Do you?

Then why should I?

Especially when I have something
that's gonna cheer you up.

They look good.

"Good"?

Morning. Ready to do
some walking?

They're more than good.

They're--
They're your favorite.

No, bacon and eggs
are my favorite.

But these are okay, too.

What's going on, Alice?

Well, I made him
his favorite breakfast food,

hoping that it would
help him remember, but he...

These-- These are okay.

Really.

It's all right, Alex.
I see what's happening.

Do you?
Because it's so obvious.

It's-- It's so obvious,
yet no one seems to see it.

You're upset because
he's leaving today,

so upset that you
accidentally

made him Timmy's
favorite food,
not Alex's.

No. No, that is not it.

I bet if you take one bite,
it will help you remember.

That's all it takes.
You know, just--

just-- just
a familiar thing

to help you remember.

Just like
all those obvious signs
that you showed me.

Listen. Here.
[doorbell rings]

What can we do
for you, Father?

Well, me and the other fathers
have taken it upon ourselves

to reach out
to the member base--

to the ones who haven't
been led in prayer recently.

And according to the directory,

it's been over a year
since you've been in,

so I wanted to come on down
and re-invite you

to services at St. Matthews.

And how is Timmy?

Has the Lord struck
the sickness out of him yet?

He's getting better. Yes.
It's sweet of you to wonder.

Ah! There he is.

Hello, Timmy.
How are you?

He's grown shy
since the disease.

He doesn't feel comfortable
in his own skin.

Uh, Father, we were--

we were sort of
in the middle of something.

So if there's nothing else...
I'm sorry.

No, no.
Uh, thank you.

Excuse me.
Have a good day.

What the hell
are you doing?
Shh!

You don't want the priest
to hear you swearing like that.

Why doesn't he know
Timmy is dead?

Oh, sweetie, no one knows.

We didn't see the point
of telling anyone when we--

we knew you
were coming back.

You've escaped
from the monsters.

Returned like you said
you would.

Alice...
Mark.

Alice, stop.

See?

It's my fault.

It's mine.

I should've known sooner.

Maybe if I had, you wouldn't
have gotten hurt again.

I shouldn't have stayed.
I was selfish.

Oh, Timmy,
you had no choice.

You were drawn to it.
It's your house.

I'm not Timmy.

Well, of course, you are.

Listen. Look, you, uh--

You knew where you used
to sit in the garden,

you knew your favorite game

was Monopoly...
Alice!

Enough!

Let me help.

You're not ready.

[vase shatters]

You're not ready.


We failed, didn't we?
We lost him again.

No. Alice,
Alex is not dead.

Now, I have
bandaged his feet.

The paramedics can do
the rest when they get here.

You called an ambulance?
I'm calling one, and then
I'm calling a doctor for you.

How could you do that
after everything that
he has told us and shown us?

You used to believe
that he would come back.

I was shock--
We were in shock.

Two parents believing
in their son is not shock,

it's love.

No.

Read this.

"Dear Mom and Dad,
I can't do this to you anymore.

"You both are too good
of parents to deserve
the pain I've caused you.

"I'll come back
when I'm better.

Love, Timmy."

This was in the vase?
Yes.

You saw it.
He knocked the vase down.

He broke it. Why?

Because he put a note
in there a year ago,

knowing it was my favorite vase,
but we never found it.

So he showed us.

He's trying to tell us it's him,
even if he doesn't know it yet,

and we have to listen.

It's not possible.
I want it to be,
but it's not--

Just think about
what's happened.

That's all I'm asking.

He tries to leave,
and he gets hit,

and then we get another chance
to realize it's him.

And I do.

So does the priest,
a man of God.

But still, we argue,
and what happens?

He gets hurt again.

We can't keep denying it.

If we do,

the next time he leaves,
we won't be so lucky.

And neither will he.

[bird chirping]

It's singing for us, sweetie.

Singing because
it's so happy.


You need a haircut,
Timmy.

It's gotten too long.

We'll, um...

get you all fixed up
after you're feeling better.

How's that sound?

I'm, uh...
I'm not Timmy.

Whoa. Easy there, champ.

You need to stay calm,
all right?

This will be worse
than a tackle.

And he's taken plenty
of those.

Okay? Trust me.

Trust me, buddy.
You just...

You'd much rather get this

than have me stitch you up
without it.

Shh, shh, shh!
I can't move!

[grunts, mutters]

Shhhh!

We can't have you hurting
yourself again.

We need to make sure
you're safe.

[dial tone]

What's wrong?

That was Alex's mother.

She called me a monster.

She said he was safe at home
and never coming back.

Oh!

How is he?
Sleeping.

I'm just getting his pain pills
together for the week.

Is everything else
taken care of?

Yeah.

He, uh, should be safe.

No way a burglar
could get in or out.

How about a safecracker?

I don't know what's worse,
the knee injury or his feet.

I mean, 50 stitches
can't be pleasant.

Honey, he'll play again.

Morning, bright eyes.

You look happy to see me.

Your, uh, father's gonna come
on in and check your bandages,

but I wanted
to come in first.

You okay?
[footsteps approaching]

It's okay.
It's the anesthetic.

Dries your mouth out
the first day.

My poor baby.

Here. Um...

Why don't you write down,
oh, what you're thinking?

There you go.

I'll hold it for you.

Done?

Let's get you back in.

I know. I know.

There we go.
All safe and sound.

It's not very nice.

It's not nice at all.

And we raised you better.

[locks clicking]

Going through your shirts!

Ugh.

Oh, sparkly.

I'm stealing
your jewelry box.


Consider it payment for making
me come back here for days

when I could've been stealing
other people's shit.

I want to...

move.

What?
Move.

Um, okay.

Okay, but you can't
tell Alice, okay?

We'll just stay
in here.

Deal?

Oh, you see?
See how much better
your knees are?

You couldn't bend them
like that three days ago.

So, uh...

So, uh, I didn't know.

I mean, you hadn't talked
about it, but had you--

Had you still wanted
to go there?

Because if you did,
I'll bet

if you got back in shape
in the next six months,

you could still make
the fall tryouts.

Please.

Let me leave.

Don't-- Don't put any weight
on your feet.

You don't want those stitches
popping out.

[door closes]

[lock clicks]

What do you think?

You're not mad
that I took everything
out of storage, are you?

[sprinkler whirring]

[locks clicking]

Look at what
I made for you.

Mark!
What is he doing up?

He's not ready!

See?
He has hurt himself already.

I thought if he
could move around--

You have to let me go.

Please.

People are expecting me.

People I work with.

The monsters?
Don't worry, sweetie.

I told them
that you were home,

and that you're
not coming back.

They can't hurt
you anymore.

I'm not home.
This isn't my home.

This is how
you treat your parents

when they try
to help you?

I'm not--
Don't even think
about saying

such hurtful things.

Please.

I'm not your son.

Check his feet
and get him in bed.

I do not like treating you
like you are six again,

but since nasty things have been
coming out of your mouth,
you leave me no choice.

I want you to lay here and think
about what you've done.

I will be back at 10:00,
and it better be a clean mouth
that I return to.


[locks clicking]

Hi. Uh, this is Mark Smith
for Dr. Nance.

Please, call me Jack.

We have, after all,
met many times before.

No, we haven't.
I've never met you before.

Why would you say that when,
in fact, we have, several times?

Don't you remember
I used to come here

for your family's
counseling sessions?

I know I've probably put on
a few love pounds,
as I like to call them,

but surely I don't look
that much different
from last year.

My name is Alex Wells.

I'm not their son.

I look like him,
but it's not me.
He's dead.

Do you know why
your father called me?

Your family has relapsed,
and he asked me to intervene.

Last time,
it was for them--

for the difficulty
they were having
in dealing with your illness.

It was quite simply
destroying them.

We're passed that now.

We've accepted it,
and we're here only
for him.

Absolutely.
That's right.

Please.

You don't understand.

Tell me,
what am I not understanding?

That I'm not Timmy.

They're trying
to make me into him.

I told you, he's dead.

Could it be that maybe that's
what you feel deep inside,

that you're dead,

and that's why you've
taken on this other persona?

It's not a persona.

They lock me in a room.

They tie me to a bed.

Those are medical restraints.
We don't like using them.

We only use them
when he's sleeping.

But he's continually
trying to hurt himself.

Like his feet.
He tried to go out
the front door the other day.

I knew he wasn't ready.
He lost his balance,

knocked over a vase,
and he fell onto
the broken glass.

You can't believe this.
Don't believe this.
Look at his face.

I see concern
on his face, Timmy.

Now, I may not condone
the methods,

but if you're gonna try
to hurt yourself,

what choice do they have?

Put you in
a medical facility?

Someone has
to take care of you,

and wouldn't you prefer
that it be them?

I think the reason
that he's retreated
into this other persona

is out of fear
of what's happening to him.

For him to come out,
he needs to feel assured

that it's okay
to live as Timmy again.

But how do we do that?

Make things comfortable.

Remind him that it's okay
and fun to live as Timmy.

We--
Even with his disability.

We have. I have.

We've, uh--

We've done some
of his favorite things

to make him feel
at home.

He even chose some,
like Monopoly

or his favorite movie.

Yes, yes, but who was he
during those times?

Alex.
Exactly.

He's living the good things
as Alex,

completely forgetting
that he used to experience

those exact same things
as Timmy.

And they were still good.

So we need to show him
that he can have fun

and enjoy things
as Timmy.

But you must be firm.

He may not remember
that something used to be
his favorite thing.

Blocked it out so he can
experience it new as Alex.

Don't let him.

Be firm,
like you would a child.

And hopefully, in time,
he'll come out of his shell

and remember, "Hey,
it's okay to be Timmy."

Is that okay
with you, Timmy?

Participating in sessions
with your parents?

If I do, could I try sleeping
without restraints

and having my door unlocked?

Well, if you promise
not to hurt yourself,

and your parents are comfortable
with where you are,

I don't see why not.

Thank you.

For?

For calling Dr. Nance.

Mmm.

I gotta tell you,

I was really starting
to lose it.

Just having him
in our grasp

and not knowing
how to bring him back,

what else to do.

Wanna see the first exercise
I have planned?

Then plant this exactly
where you used to.

And, Timmy,
no funny business.

I'll be watching to make sure
you do it right.

[door opens]

Okay.

Where would Timmy plant?

Come on, Timmy.
Stop fooling around.

[glass shatters]

[glass shatters]

[glass crunching]

[glass shatters]

Pick your player.

That's enough, young man.

Pick the piece
you always use.

Alice, stop. Your hand...
I don't care.

I'm not playing around anymore.

Which you clearly still are.

But that's fine.

I'm gonna be firm.
I need to be.

And if I get hurt
in the process,

then at least
you'll see the pain
your little game is causing.

Now, go again.

Very good.
[relieved sigh]

Now, you two,
let's have some fun.

** [rock]

* Got a jonesin'
for the 'Mats *

Josie?

Volume knobs were invented
so that fathers

could get work done
in the other room.

[door rattles]

Why is your door locked?

Did you steal
something again?

Just your heart, Father.

Good.
Keep it that way.

Then you're gonna spend
the day with your father.

You excited?

You should be.

He's been in his office
preparing for your exercise.

And, uh, don't worry.

I figured out a way
to make sure you don't
get hurt again.

He's all yours.

I am going shopping.

Bye, honey.

You have a good night's sleep?

Yeah.

Best one yet.

Good. Good.

So, um, you--you probably
didn't have a chance

to see yesterday's
scores yet.

In fact, you--
you probably haven't had
a chance to catch up

with the scores
from this past year

since things have been
so weird for you
and all, huh?

No, I haven't, but, uh,
I'm dying to know.

Trust me.

Then wait until
you see this.

I started it
when I had to...

give up on you
coming back.

There's a section for

all your favorite baseball,
basketball, and football teams,

and every game,
every score,

every standing
from the past year.

All your favorite
athletes, too.

It's all here.

See that one?

I must've read
that one 500 times.

Every time I did, I...

I could hear how excited
you would've been.

It had to seem like
you were still almost here.

You still know.

You know
this isn't right, Mark.

You know it's not me.

Listen. Just--Just listen.
Listen to me.

They're down by one,
and all they need's
a field goal.

You know?
Just...

And it's raining.

Just let me go
before she gets back, please.

Listen to me.
Please.

It's great.
They're down by one.

You, uh, shampooed
your hair yet, sweetie?

I was just about to.

Let me.

Do you know why your father
is sitting in his office upset?

Because I do.

I was in there,
assuming you were doing good,

continuing to make progress.

And then he told me
what you said.

I can explain. It was--
Rinse.

[water sloshing]

[Alex gasping]

To me it sounded
like you wanted to leave.

That for every step forward,
you were taking a step back.

Did you say it?

You missed a spot,
sweetie.

[water sloshing]

[Alex gasping]

Yes or no?

Yes!

I, uh, was feeling bad,
looking at all that stuff.


Knowing what I missed
this past year, you know?

I got scared and relapsed.

That's better.

It won't happen again.

[Woman on TV]
I'm Miss Childs,
and I'll be filling in...

We're watching this again?
I like this movie.
It's really funny.

So if you'll take
your books out...

What is it?

It's the movie
we watched last week

when I pretended
to be Alex.

[Girl on TV]
Miss Shane had
a whole party planned.

And what is your name,
young lady?

But that's not
the first time
I've seen it.

I've seen this movie,
uh, a bunch of times.

Well, there's nothing...

This is not just a movie
you've seen a bunch of times.

This is your favorite movie.

I know that.

Then why didn't you say that
to begin with, young man?

Why do you act
as if you saw it

for the first time
last week?

Come on, champ.

You know this.
You remember this.

I relapsed.
I didn't meant to, but I--

You swore that
that would never happen again.

It won't.

Then what is it called?

[chattering on TV]

You wanna keep testing me?

Then you will stay in here
and watch this movie

until Thursday
with no food.

But today's Monday.

Don't blame me.
This is your own doing.

You blew your chance
at easy, fun-time exercises.

Now, I will be in
every two hours to reset it,

and each time
I catch you sleeping,
it will be an extra day.

[Miss Childs on TV]
I'm Miss Childs,
and I'll be filling in

as your substitute.

[door slams]

[latches unlocking]

[TV: long, sustained beep]


[Miss Childs on TV]
I'm Miss Childs,
and I'll be filling in

as your substitute.

So if you'll take
your books out and turn--

[door slams]

[latches unlocking]

[Girl on TV]
Um, today's, like,
my last day.

Miss Shane had
a whole party planned.

And what is your name,
young lady?

Heather.
I'm the class president.

Well, there's nothing here
in my notes about a party.

Why is this your last day?

'Cause my daddy got a big-time
job at a new lawyers firm.

We're, like, moving...

[TV: long, sustained beep]

I'm Miss Childs,
and I'll be filling in

as your substitute.

But I'm hoping against
that thing called hope

that once he gets readjusted
to being home again,

his mother'll let him
come back and work with us.

I don't know.
She did call you a monster.

Hello?

Are you two fine-ass bitches
high off books?

I just said his mother
is dead.

Whoever called, it wasn't her.

I know what this is.
I saw it on the news.

Unkempt girls like her
go around

trying to convince others
to give information.

It's called, uh...

[mimicking stammering]

Identity theft.
That's it.

And she did have his ID.

Bertha, call the police
and let them have her.
Hello?

Why don't you just
go and help Marco?

[bell dinging]
Go on.

Three weeks ago,
she called...

Pooh on you again!
[bell dinging]

[Heather on TV]
Um, today's, like, my last day.
[latches unlocking]

Miss Shane had
a whole party planned.

And what is your name,
young lady?

Heather.
I'm the class president.

Time's up, young man.

You done horsing around,
or do we leave you here
for another day?

Well, there's nothing here
in my notes about a party.

Why is this
your last day?
Done.

'Cause my daddy got a big-time
job at a new lawyers firm.

We're, like, moving
into a better home.

He says I'll be--

Thank you...

Mom.

What?

Thank you, Mom.

Wait here.

What--What's going on?

Just be patient, champ.
Just be patient.

Ready.

Close your eyes.

Open your eyes.

Happy birthday!

Happy birthday.

I know it's a little late
due to bad behavior,

but better late
than never, right?

Right.

What are you waiting for?
They're not gonna blow
themselves out.

[blowing weakly]

Um, sorry.

I must be a little tired.

Honey, they're--

Honey,
they're trick candles.

It was your father's idea.

Hey, it might have been my idea,
but who bought them?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Here we go.
Here we go.

Let's get those out.
That's coming out.

Ooh.
Whoo.


All right, sweetie.
Yeah.

Which piece do you want?

Um...

How about...

[Mark laughing]
all of it?

[Alice laughing]

What's wrong, Mom?

I don't know
what to say.

I've waited for this
for a year--

in the hall, in my room--

wondering when you
were gonna come back,

when we were all
gonna be sitting here.

I just don't know
what to say.

You don't have to.

I've come back.

Can't I sleep
without them tonight?

Like we talked about
with Dr. Nance?

I'm ready.

I know, but...

Well, I--I think it's fair.

What if he falls out of bed?
He could fall out of bed.

I'm not a little boy
anymore, Mom.

I'm 19 now.
I'm not gonna fall out of bed.

We did make a deal.

Fine.
We did.

Okay, but if you need anything,
I will be right outside, okay?

Good night.

[floor creaking]

[soft clangs]

[wheel squeaks]

[soft clangs]

[wheels squeaking]

[squeaking continues]


Timmy?

I was thirsty.
I'm just getting some water.

That's okay, honey.
I'll get it for you.

No, I've got it.

You can go back to bed.

Only if I can help you
back to yours.

We've come a long way
since then, haven't we?

You don't remember
that yet, do you?

How you first died.

You thought you were
a burden.

You didn't wanna be,
and so you tried
to sneak out.

You saw us coming,
you tried to run,

and your body
couldn't take it.

You fell.

We stayed with you
for days,

waiting for you
to come back.

We didn't know
it would take a year.

That is over now.

We are passed it.

Let's get you back to bed.

Oh, give me your water.
I'll hold it for you.

Were you trying
to sneak out again?

No. I just...

I just forgot my glass
in the kitchen.

But I don't understand.

We've been good.

You're not a burden anymore.
Why would you...

You're not fully back.
You lied.

Let me go.
I will not!

We trusted you,
and you lied.

You said you were better.
We celebrated your birthday.

I'm not your son!

You are horrible, awful!

Only a horrible child
would say such a thing!

What's going on? Alice?
Mark, he's trying to leave.

Don't turn him against you,
all right?
No.

Alice--
No. No.

Let's talk about it,
all right?

Let's see what the problem is.
Sweetie--Sweetie...

Everybody take a deep breath.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

Maybe we need to slow down.
Let me go!

I'm not Timmy!
[body thuds]

He's okay, right, Mark?

Tell me.
Tell me he's okay.

Tell me he's okay!

Don't say it.

Alice, please.

It's only been 10 hours.

Ten hours!

Last time,
it took a year.

So don't say it.

No.

No!

Come back.

Come back!

I'm not dead.

I'm still alive.

Please, please come back.

Please come back,
Mom and Dad.

I'm still waiting.

I so want you to come back.

I want you to come back.

[footsteps approaching]

What are you doing in here?
I told you not to come in here.

And I told you
not to steal.

But I need that,
Daddy.

I'm sure you've convinced
yourself of that.

Fine.
I'll just take these.

That's all right.
I've got everything
backed up on disc.

I don't need those anymore.
Holy shit!

Who did you steal this from
and why?

I know him!
He's your patient?

Josie, you're not
gonna get it back.

Stop trying to change
the subject from yourself.

That's the reason
you're not getting
any better.

Oh, my God!
What?

Spider! Oh, my God!
In the shadows!
Where?

Kill it, kill it!

That's a nice try.

Give me the file.

Give me the file
and the box.

I'm sorry, Dad.

I need to go think about
why I do what I do.

You better.
All right.

[engine starts]

Alex!

Alex!

Come back!

Alex?


Holy shit!

Please.

Please come back.


Mom?

No, Josie.

What the hell happened?

You have to leave.
I have to wait for them.

Uh, okay, sure.

No!

No, I have to wait
for them.

You don't understand.
It's my fault.

What? No, it's not your fault.
Come on.

You don't know what I did.

You don't know.

I'm horrible.

It was an accident.

You know that.

They're not coming back.

The people that are coming back,
on the other hand, are psychos.

Okay?
Which means we need to go.

[car approaching]

The front door's over here.

[keys jingling]
They're back.

All right.
It's all set up.

I'll be back
to check on you
in a few minutes.

We were good,
weren't we?

Good to him?

What are we gonna do?

I'm gonna go get some boxes,

and you're gonna
watch Dr. Alred.

Honey, can't we
check the garden?

Alice...
Maybe he just...

Alice...

[door closes]

[TV on]

[Dr. Alred on TV]
Hello, I'm Dr. Alred.

This must be
a very trying time.

You have to remember

that what you're going through
is normal.

Anyone who encounters
such tragedy

goes through
these very feelings.

Many familiar things
will remind you of your loss,

but do not run
from these objects.

Embrace them.

They'll serve
as a constant reminder

and help keep their spirit
alive within your home,

even as maybe
you try to forget.

If you run,

you're erasing
their memory,

which is the last thing
you wanna do.

That's why he forgot.

He didn't have anything
to remember us by.

He needs something--

any-anything to help him
remember.

Anything before Mark
packs him away.

Something that he'll see
right when he comes back.

To leave under with him.

There needs to be
no doubt.


The cake.

He would never forget
his own nose.

Um...

This is perfect.

What else?

What else, what else
what else, what else?

Okay.

Mark, he's back!
Get out here!

[door opens]
What's wrong?

Nothing. Everything's right.

Guard the front door.
He might be scared.

What are you talking about?
He's back! He's come back!

On the same day!
He-He came back for the cake!

I was slicing a piece
so that he would have
something to remember,

which is what
we didn't do before.

Alice--Alice, stop.
No! N-No!

Go! Go look yourself!

Go on.


Timmy? Honey?

Come on out.
Don't be scared.

We're your parents.
That's right.

Your-- Your mom
and your dad.

Timmy, honey,
where are you?

He was dead.
He was dead.

No, not for us.

Well, where is he?

I'm gonna go
and check out back,

and you stay
by the door.

Timmy?

Timmy? Timmy?

Timmy.

The hall.
We can get out a back window.

Timmy.

What's wrong with your feet?
Nothing. I'm fine.

[door opens]
Timmy?

Timmy?

Where?
[door closes]

The closet.

She won't look in here?

Mark won't let her.
He says that this is his place.

Come on out, honey.
It's Mom.

Timmy, sweetie,
where are you?

Come on, honey.

Quit playing around.
Stop hiding from me.

Timmy, this isn't
funny anymore.

We're getting scared.

Maybe we should look
down the street.
He might've left.

No, he is in this house.
I know it.

Timmy, I don't wanna punish you
on your first day back,

but if you're not out here
by the time I count to five,

then you have only
yourself to blame.

One,

two,

three,

four...

Timmy, come out right now!

Oh, my God! He's hurt!

That's why he's not coming out.
He's too hurt.

[door opens]

Timmy?

Honey?

Do you remember
what this place is?

It's your father's office.

He works from here because
we wanted to be home
when you came back.

Timmy, open up.

Honey, I know you're hurt.

I just wanna help you.
I wanna make you feel better.

I'm your mother.
That's what moms do.

We would never have left
if we knew you were gonna
come back so soon.

I'm sorry, Mom.
Oh, my God.

Oh, honey.

We're not mad at you.

Just open the door.

Timmy!

Open up now!

[bangs on door]

All right. Then we're
gonna do it the hard way.

Mark, give me the keys
to your office.

Give them to me.
Alice, please.

Timmy!

Timmy, open the door!

Timmy!

Mark, hurry up.

Alice...

Honey,

you don't need
to hide anymore.

I'm here,
and so is your father.

He hung up all these
clippings for you.

That's how much
he loves you.

I know you have
a lot of questions.

I'm gonna try and answer them
better than before.

Timmy...


Alice? Alice?
[door opens]

Sit me down.

He's got someone with him!

She's strong.

Stealing from us.

Timmy, who is this?
Do you know her?

Yeah, she's my friend, Josie.

You--You don't know
a Josie.

You never knew a Josie.
He knows me.

You did this to him.
You ruined him.

You were the first person
he saw.

Timmy,
you don't know her.

You know me
and your father.

You're not his parents.

Tell them what happened
to your parents, Alex.

Nothing happened.
Nothing happened to them.

He just doesn't remember us.

Tell her, Alex.
He just doesn't
remember us.

Tell her, Alex!

I think it is time
for you to leave.

They le--

They left.

They were looking
for me.

If I...hadn't left,

they wouldn't have died.

But it wasn't my fault.

It was-- It wasn't...

It wasn't my fault.

That's why
you told Alice

that you couldn't
remember them?

That's not it, Mark.
Is that why?

It's because you
filled his head with that.

She was there when we--
when we weren't.

We should've been there
for him.

We should've been there for...

But we are now,
and that is what is important.

Remember who you are,
not what she tells you to.

See? His name is Alex.

Tell her, Alex.
Tell her why you came here.

You saw her, right?
You followed them.

No, no, no.
You stole him from me.

I work at the library.

You come in all the time.
I saw you there,

and you saw me once,
watching you.

I tried telling you.
No, no, no, no, no.

I did.

No.

Timmy, if you don't remember...

then I have to start all over

and show you things
to help you remember,

and I don't wanna do that.

Please don't make me do that.

Please remember.

Don't make me do that, Timmy!

Come on.

No!

What are you doing?
You're letting him leave!

His keys!
What do you take me for?

No! No! No!
Let me go!

What are you doing?
You're letting him leave!

Timmy! He's leaving!

Let me go!
Timmy! Honey!

Stay! It's-- It's okay!

It's okay. Stay.

[Alice sobbing]

[engine starts]

Baby!

[car departing]

Our son is gone.

Our son is gone.

[sobbing continues]
