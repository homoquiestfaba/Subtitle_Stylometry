â™ª

â™ª

[Cai] The jellyfish.
[Tariq] Yeah.


â™ª

â™ª

[Cai] That was great.
[Tariq] Yeah.


[both panting]


You're crazy, man. Never.


What do you think
your favorite animal is now?

My favorite animal?

The grizzly bear, I guess.

'Cause it's so...

It's like a beast.

It's the definition of a beast.

Yeah.
[Tariq] Why, though?

What's your favorite animal?

I think it changed.

I saw a sea turtle
the other day.

Isn't he here, actually?

But, um...

yeah.

They're just swimming around.

Gracefully, you know?

Just seem kind of...

at peace and,
just, I don't know...

quiet. Calm.

What I love is that

whatever beach they hatch on,

um, they always go
back to that same beach

to then lay their eggs.

Um, and they go for
miles and miles and miles

but then they always come back.
It's like this...

homing instinct.

I really like it.
Yeah.

[boat engine rumbling]

[speaking Arabic]

[speaking Arabic]

[speaking Arabic]


[Cai speaking Arabic]

[speaking Arabic]

[Middle Eastern music playing]

[bar din]


[Tariq chuckling]

it defeat the purpose

if you did it with
a plastic knife?

We're just kind of

working our way up
to a real knife.

Oh. Can I try?


[speaking Arabic]

For example, if it's in a cage,

it's just being
constantly fed food.

It doesn't understand
it has to go out and actually,

like, get it itself.

Birds of prey, for example,

especially falcons,
if they're kept in cages

the whole time, they lose this,

um, muscle mass here,
which is the pectoral muscles,

[woman] Mm-hmm.
Which they need

to actually fly.

So, as soon as it
gets let out into the wild,

you know, it tries
to catch its prey and...

and it just can't.
And then these animals,

they'll starve after,
like, three days.

So, you need to build that up
over time by training it.


Do you love animals
as much as Cai here?

Nobody loves animals
as much as Cai.

[Cai] Whatever, Tariq.
[woman laughing] Really?

Are you going here
for university?

Uh, I don't know.
Probably not.

I wanna,
um, study animal conservation.

[woman] Mm.
So, um...

there aren't that
many good, like,

programs here for that.
[woman] Mm, yeah.

of want to go outside.

Uh, maybe to New York?


Uh...

I... I want to finish
high school.

I had to take a break.

[woman speaking Arabic]

Um...

[Tariq speaking Arabic]

[speaking Arabic]

Oh.

[speaking Arabic]

What was your favorite
thing about her?

She was... she was funny.

sure she was very lovely.

Well, I think I need to get
back to work before I open...

We might have
a good story for you.

Really?
[Tariq] Yeah.

It's about a cove near here
where this one-armed guy,

uh, who smuggles animals,

lives there alone
with his birds.

Um, his arm got bitten
off by a leopard.

He has a deal with a jinn,
he made a deal with a jinn...

if any of that's true.

It's true.

a big problem in the region.


The jinn is a big
problem in the region.

Stop it. Not the jinn.

I mean, like, the whole animal
smuggling thing is a problem.

They're trying to figure
out who's doing it.

Stop doing that. Stop laughing.
I gotta pee, man.

Tariq. It is.

it's a good story.

Yes, it is.

Just watch out
for the jinn in the bathroom.

[Cai laughing]

He's so scared.
[woman] Why?

[waves lapping]

[birds chirping]

Bye, Mom.
[Cai's mom] Love you. Have fun.

[car horns honking]

[drums pattering]


[Cai] How are you, man?
You look good, man.

What do you think? Hey,
can you help me tie my masar?

Yeah, sure, sure.

This way, right?
Yeah.

Hey, how's your sister?

Uh, it's her wedding.

She's probably stressed
but I'm sure...

I'm sure she's fine.

[music fading out]


Uh, I'm saving myself
for someone special,

and you know that.

[rock clattering]

That's the target?
Yeah.

[crickets chirping]

[rock clattering]
[Tariq] Yeah.

How did your mom and dad meet?

[rooster crowing]

Uh, I don't know exactly.

My parents are weird.

Sometimes it feels
like their main love

is their work here, you know?

[rock clattering]

Hey, I like your parents.

Yeah, they're cool, it's just...

I don't know,
sometimes I feel like-

Whatever, man.

They leave you alone,
you get to do whatever you want.

You're lucky.

Was tonight the first
time that Alia met Ahmed?

No, they met a couple
of times before.

His father was
a good friend of my dad.

What's he like?

Ahmed?
[Cai] Yeah.

He's fine, I guess.

Shit. What time is it?

Uh, I think it's the morning.
I'm not sure.


You're just leaving
'cause I'm winning.

you have this one. See you.

All right, man,
see you in a bit.

[Cai speaking Arabic]

[speaking Arabic]


[Tariq speaking Arabic]

[speaking Arabic]


You're not the savior
of the animal kingdom.

Look...

almost all of these animals
were born in captivity.

And I didn't put them here.

I work here because...

I want people to
care about them more.

I work here.

Twice as much as you do,

because even though the pay
is shit, it still pays.

[birds cawing & squawking]

You have more time than
I do to care about these things.

We're not gonna go extinct.

We're smart people.

[rooster crowing]

We figured it out.

And even if it's all true...

people are just trying to live,

you know?

animals more than you admit.

I never said I hated animals.

I just care about people more.

like a bunch of bullshit.

And people suck.
They don't care about things

until they're this close
to their face.

And since they're all here,
they can learn about them.

Keep them healthy.

This one's still my favorite.

There're all these other animals
who would die in the wild.

They can't hunt,
they can't fend for themselves.

They'd be prey in an instant.

Or they would starve to death.

This one is...

This one would survive?
[Cai] No, look at it.

It's weak.

I need to train it. Properly.

[birds cawing & squawking]

Hey, have a look at this tiger.

[animals bleating & chirping]

Fucking motherfucker.

[Cai laughing]


Mine's wet, man.
[Cai] That's disgusting.

[bees buzzing]

[car horn honking]

[people arguing in Arabic]

Alia?

Alia?
[Alia speaking Arabic]

[Tariq's father speaking Arabic]

Alia?

[Tariq's father speaking Arabic]

[Arabic trap music
playing on speakers]

[birds squawking]

Oh, oh, just leave it.
It's not for you.

You try it, then.

I don't want to
get my shoes dirty.

Do you know how much this costs?


What are you doing?

Improving them.
Serious?

Didn't even pay for shit, man.

Your parents bought
them for you.

Oh, wow.

Well, at least my parents
can afford new shoes for me.

[skateboard rattling]

I'm gonna get a snack.
Can anyone spot me?

Uh, yeah, I got some
cash in my pocket if you want.

â™ª



Give it back, give it back.
Faris, Faris.

Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, come on.
Give it back.

Give it back.
[Mo] What are these?

They're gauntlets.

â™ª

And that's pigeon meat.
Ew.


Yeah. Cai has been making
friends with one of the falcons.

He wants to steal it

so he can train it
and then set it free.

Don't set it free.
You should sell it.

Let's do it now.

We can help you train it.

No.
Why not?

I'm not doing it now.

I'm doing it by myself.

Guys, guys.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm not... I'm not gonna do it
with you shitheads here. No.

[birds cawing & squawking]

How much did
the zoo pay for this?

Not much.
It's not worth much untrained.

You know, my uncle paid
5,000 for one like this.


No, I hate to say it,
but Mo's right.

I mean,

when these things are trained
they can go for quite a lot.

Take it now.

I'll give you 50 if you take it.

Fifty.

[call to prayer playing faintly]

â™ª


[birds cawing & squawking]

[wings flapping]

Tariq,
what the hell are you doing?

What's going on?

It's private.

You can tell me.

It's a family thing, Cai.

You don't understand.

What do you mean
I don't understand?

Okay, fine.

It's Alia.

She needs my help.

She told me she wants
to get a divorce.

Why? What happened?

I don't know.

[birds cooing & chirping]

she just dislikes him.

He actually seems really scary.

I'm sorry to have to ask, but...

what does this have to do with
you trying to steal a pigeon?

I promised her I would
help her get the money.

For what?
To get a divorce.

She needs to bring
him back everything

he gave us at the wedding.

How much is it?

A lot.
How much is a lot?

<i>A lot</i> a lot.

And your dad just can't...

[birds cooing & chirping]

I'm gonna ask my parents...
No.

No.
[Cai] Why not?

It's a very private thing, Cai.

I need to solve this myself.
Okay.

So, we're stealing pigeons...

and then what?

Selling them.
Just pigeons?

Just pigeons, right?

What else have
you tried to sell?

Couple of pigeons...

two of the cats,
and a few other birds.

What else?
That's it, I swear.

I swear, that's it.

Okay.

They have to have
been born in captivity.

So, animals
that wouldn't survive

if we just set them free.
Yeah.

Um, definitely no
endangered species.

Okay.
And,

ideally,
we send them to a good home.

So, pretty much all of these.

Let me add,
let's be smart about this.

We both know what we can

and what we can't
get away with here, so...

let's just not lose our jobs.

We're not going
to lose our jobs.

We know this place
better than anyone.

It's just a side business.

[dark Arabic music]

[speaking Arabic]

[speaking Arabic]

Yeah, we got it.

[speaking Arabic]

[man speaking Arabic]

[Tariq speaking Arabic]

â™ª

how soft it is?

That's why it's so...

expensive.
How much?

they go for about 30 rial.

â™ª

[Cai speaking indistinctly]

[Cai chuckles]

[children chattering excitedly]

[Tariq speaking Arabic]

[woman speaking Arabic]

[Tariq speaking Arabic]

[speaking Arabic]

<i>Shukran.</i>

[speaking Arabic]

Are you selling pigeons?
Yep.

Can I have a look?

Uh, yeah. It's the Zajal.
The Zajal?

Yeah.

How much for that white one?

[indistinct]
Yeah.

<i>- Shukran.
Shukran.</i>

<i>Shukran.</i>

â™ª

Hey.

Seventy rial... for two pigeons.


[engine grumbling]

[goats bleating]

It's all right. It's all right.

Tariq, Tariq.

Oh, my God. Okay.
Can you... can you help me?

What is it?
[Cai] I need your help.

[Tariq] Like this?
No, I need-

I need to put these dresses
on her, but I don't...

I don't think
I can do it on my own,

so I'm gonna need
you to hold her, okay?

Yeah? Look...
Just tell me how.

If you get your right hand...
I want you to hold her.

You see how
I'm holding its legs?

[Tariq] Yeah.
[Cai] Get your right hand

and put it...
Put it where mine is.

And then make sure
you get its legs.

Okay.
And your left hand the same.

Think you've got it?
[Tariq] Yeah.


Okay, sit down here.

And then turn around.

Okay.

perfect, perfect, perfect.

[Cai mumbling faintly]

[rooster crowing]

Poor thing. Okay.

Soon it'll be over.

Okay.

So, once I put
this rope through...

then I'm gonna attach it to my...
My gauntlet.

And then we're
gonna hoist her up.

I'm gonna have her in my hand.

Okay?

Be very fast, but...

we should be okay.

Okay.

Just like this?

Stand up.

We're gonna let her go,
she's gonna come to me.

Okay.

There we go. Okay.

There she is. Whew.

[inspiring music]


Isn't she gorgeous?

I can't believe it worked.

It's all right.
It's okay, it's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay. Yeah.


Isn't she beautiful?

â™ª

So, grab... grab this
with your right hand.

Okay, I'm gonna hold this.

Slowly I'm gonna
wriggle my hand out.

Okay, okay.
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

Nice, Tariq, nice. Nice.

[Cai chuckling]

Perfect.

How does she feel?
Man... I have no words.


This is our living space.

Here are the stairs.

So, part of the... the
manning process is that...

you've got to
keep talking to her

so she gets used to your voice.

This is our beautiful hallway.


Our entrance. Very grand.

Yeah.

My God, she's doing so well.

She's so calm.
Yeah.

[music fading out]

[traffic din in distance]

[dog barking in distance]

[forlorn music]

â™ª

[phone ringing]

[phone beeping]

[crickets chirping]

How is she?


[goats bleating]

Do you think she's okay?


Today was a good day.
Made about 50 bucks.

It's too slow.

Do you have a better idea?


But I've been thinking
about that guy.

What guy?

The smuggler Hilal showed us.


Do you really think
he cursed that place?


there's a jinn protecting
his pirate's cove?

[Tariq sighs]

[Cai speaking Arabic]


I'm not afraid of the jinn.

I'm afraid
of that one-armed man.

You wanna send
him these rabbits?

No.

I want to send
him something bigger.

[tense music]

[snake quietly hissing]


I thought you loved all animals.

I do, I just...

I don't prefer snakes.

Actually...

I hate to say it, but
this one's worth quite a lot.

Are you sure?
[Cai] Yeah.

The zoo has no idea
how much it's worth.


It's not going to fit.

Wait, wait,
you're gonna do it now?

Wait, Tariq.
Listen, I mean... I mean... I mean

we don't even know if what
they say about that guy is true.

I mean, it sounds
like a bunch of bullshit to me.

How else do you think
he lost his arm, man?

I believe Hilal.

Okay, what are you
gonna say to Amal

when he realizes
his snake's gone?

No one's even gonna notice, man.

I'm the one who feeds her.

I can't believe
we're doing this now.

It's not like we're
selling a tiger.

Are you sure it's
worth a lot of money?

It's an albino pied.

[suspenseful music]

Can you give me the bag?

â™ª

Let's go.

Yeah, it should...
Yeah, there it is.

[Cai] This white one?
[Tariq] The white one, yeah.

I think if we get it
back by Sunday, it's all good.

Okay.
Yeah.

You sure you know
how to hot-wire a car?

Yes.
[Tariq] Yeah, awesome.

It's all on you, man.
[Cai] Okay.

[dog barking in distance]

Yeah.

So, Cai?
[Cai] Yeah?


to start the ignition...

I think this can help you
start the ignition.

[keys clattering]


no, no, no, I'm driving.

No, I said I was going to drive.


[Tariq chuckling]

[engine revving]

["MaculelÃª" by Mait InaÃª
& Ben Goldstein playing]


Open the door.

Tariq.


The door doesn't work.
[Cai] Thank you.

[engine revving]

â™ª

â™ª

[song fades out]

Shit, shit.
Stop the car, stop the car.

Shit, Lara's out.

Why was the bag open?

so she could breathe.


Can you not do that again?


[Lara quietly hissing]

Look at her.
No, no, don't...

Cut it out.
[Lara hissing]

so scared of her, man?

Because she's big.
[Tariq] She's friendly.

She's not, she's...
unpredictable.

Can you fully
close it this time?


just get in the bag for a bit.

[engine revving]

How... So, how do you think
this works?

We're just gonna show up,

give him the snake,
and he'll give us the money?


This is my first time selling
a snake on the black market.

To a smuggler.

What should we do
with the extra cash?

If it's $20,000.

It's your money, man.

Whatever you want.
Maybe we should...

buy a boat. A small boat.

And just, like,
take tourists out for rides.

Yeah.
Yeah.

We should do that.
[Cai] Yeah, that'd be cool.


to tell you, I, uh...

I got into U.B.C.


Are you gonna go?
Yeah, I think so.

It's one of my top
schools and, uh...

it's got a great animal
conservation program.

When are you leaving?

Classes start
in September, so...

late August.

[waaves lapping]

[fire crackling]

There's no future for you here.

I can't leave.

Even... even if I could
get a visa to the States.

You can't leave your family.

I don't wanna leave.

At least I don't...

I don't know.

But you know how
much I love it here.

You love it here
because you can leave.

Every summer you get
to travel and meet girls.

Do whatever you want.

While I am here
shoveling monkey shit.

I'm gonna finish school, too.

Maybe...
maybe even get a decent job.

In ministry.


I have faith in you.

What do you think?

What's it like seeing

No, no, no, no...

Tariq, call me back. Um...

I think...

I think someone
stole my falcon. Um...

Yeah, just call me
back when you can. Okay.

â™ª

[rocks clattering]

Tariq, what are you doing?

I found a buyer for A me era.

He's gonna give me
$5,000 for her.

You can't do that.
I have to.

[Cai] Tariq, she's my bird.
She's not your bird.

You took her from the zoo.

Tariq, this is stupid.

She's not trained.

A falcon isn't like a pigeon
or a rabbit!

I know that.
No one's gonna pay shit

for an untrained falcon!

They're gonna want to see
her fly free and come back!

And you take that hood off
and she's gonna be gone

in an instant,
and she's not gonna come back!

'Cause
she's gonna starve to death!

Then help me train her.

No.

No, I'm not gonna help you.

I am done selling animals
to God knows who!

And I didn't feel good
about it to begin with,

and I don't feel
good about it now.

I just did it 'cause
I wanted to help you.

â™ª

[A me era cawing]

[boys grunting]

You always act like you know
better than anyone.

You're always sending me
these things about the world

like I'm an idiot.
I know things too!

You don't understand
anything about me.

Or my family.

You think it's all a big game,
and then you complain about

how are these animals
going to be treated

as if I give a shit
when my family's in trouble.

You know what?

You're just a selfish rich kid
like Mo.

And I don't care
that you're moving to Canada.

Fuck you, Tariq.

â™ª

â™ª

[goats bleating]

[birds chirping]

Hi.
I wanted to give you this back.

I've been looking for this.

Yeah. I saw your bird
and I was curious. Sorry.

[birds chirping]

I wanted to ask you
about something.


[Cai] Oh, creance.
What is that?

It's basically like a leash,
except much longer.

So, it allows the falcon
to feel like it's flying free

without the risk
of it getting away.

Oh, okay.

[rooster crowing]

I don't know if
Tariq told you, but...

I left Ahmed.

For good. And...

I know I should be scared,
and I know what

that means for my family, but...

I feel relieved.


And Cai?

When you set her free,

can I be there?

Okay.
[Alia] Great.

â™ª

â™ª

[animals bleating & cawing]

[rooster crowing]

How's A me era?

[animals bleating & cawing]

her pigeon instead of chicken?


Maybe it's her location.

Birds in the wild have
their favorite perches.

And sometimes they won't
eat unless they're there.

She isn't flying, either.


She needs to be
hungry to fly, but...

she won't fly
if she's not healthy.

[animals bleating & cawing]

you selling her to?

Uh...

Mo's uncle wants to buy her.

But he needs to
see her fly first.

Also, I have no idea
how the leash works.

My hand is covered in scabs.

[animals bleating & cawing]

Look, I don't know if, um...

I think I can help you.

[animals bleating & cawing]

[rooster crowing]

I'm gonna miss this place.
Really?

[rooster crowing]


I'll miss the creatures
that live here, though.

[birds chirping]

Take these two shorter ones.
[Tariq] Okay.

and this one?

And you just want
to pull them equally.

To loosen the hood, okay?

Nice, and then
just pull it forward.

In one smooth motion.

There we go.
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

what you guys are doing.

[Cai] What do you mean?
Cai.

Are you really sure about this?

I'm sure, yeah.

Okay.
I've been doing some reading

and we need to change this whole
aviary.

We need to change the windows.

The shredded wire will hurt her.

-We need to put bars instead-
-[Tariq] Alia.

Alia. What are you doing?

I want to help.
No.

Cai and I are going
to solve this. Not you.

You didn't ask me if
I want you to sell her or not.

Look, this is how things are,

and I don't have
a better solution,

so I want to help.

But you can't
just come in here and...

Tariq...
[speaking Arabic]

We named her A me era.

Hi, princess.

â™ª

It's too loud for you here.

Let's take you out, okay?

Let's take you out.
Don't be scared.

â™ª

Hah!

â™ª

Hah!

â™ª

Hah!

Hah!

Okay, can you stand there?
Yeah, thanks.

Okay.

Hah!

â™ª

Hah! Hah!

â™ª

I really don't know
what's gonna happen.

Let's hope she chooses
to come to us, but...

equally she could choose
to fly away and not come back.

Uh... and then we'd
be really screwed.

We've done everything we can,

now let's just hope
for the best, Tariq.

Hold this. Don't shorten it.
Okay.

Hah!

â™ª

so she can't see it.

Hah! Hah!

â™ª

Hah!

Hah! Hah!

â™ª

Guys, I'm not sure
she's gonna do it today.

Hah!

Hah!

[wings fluttering]

[soft music]

Hey, A me era.
[indistinct]

[Cai] Oh, my God.
[chuckling]

[Tariq chuckling]

Now you like me, huh?

â™ª

[Cai yelping]

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª



How's it going?
[Cai] Good, good.

Getting there.

[guinea pig squeaking]

Mo called.

His uncle found another bird.

A me era is not ready.

He's gonna buy the other one.

Okay.

Think she's ready?

I don't know.

She might not come back.

[hood rattling]

[hood rattling]


I'm not sure if it's them.


[Alia] Oh, it's him.
Yeah. Let's go.

[greeting each other in Arabic]

[greeting each other in Arabic]

[greeting each other in Arabic]

Will it come back?

Yeah, I mean,
uh, she's a great bird.

We've been training
her for about a month now.

Um, she's got
a fantastic personality,

she's great around people.

Uh, she's at the right weight
as well, today, and...

yeah, I think
she will come back.

Zayn.
Let's see it.



[rocks crunching]

Let's go this way for the wind.
Okay?

Alia?

You ready?

â™ª

Just like we did before, okay?

I'm gonna unhook her Jesses.

Okay.

When you're ready,
take the hood off.

You can do this.
