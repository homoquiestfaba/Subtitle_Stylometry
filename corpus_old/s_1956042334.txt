MAN: (ON SPEAKER) <i>People of
Tulsa, this is your last warning.</i>

<i>Turn over your undesirables</i>

<i>and we will leave
your city standing.</i>

<i>Resist, and we will destroy
everything you hold dear.</i>

<i>This is your final warning.</i>

<i>People of Tulsa,</i>

<i>this is your last warning.</i>
Stay back.

<i>Turn over your undesirables,</i>

<i>and we will leave
your city standing.</i>

On my signal.
<i>Resist,</i>

<i>and we will destroy everything
you hold dear.</i>

Move, move!
<i>This is your final warning.</i>

<i>Give in. There's nowhere to run.</i>
(MACHINE GUN FIRING)

<i>Your heroes won't save you.</i>

Mommy, it's The Ray.

The Freedom Fighters are here.

(HEROIC INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING)

Heads up, people.

The Reich has the refugees on the
run, and they're heading this way.

Hold the line here.

We need to give them
a chance to make it to safety.

Get airborne, gentlemen.

(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

(MACHINE GUN FIRING)

We'll make those Nazi scum
see the dark.

Just what I was thinking.

SOLDIER: What the hell just happened?
I can't see anything.

PHANTOM LADY: Can you see this?


Oh, it looks like they've
had enough for today.

Good work, Phantom Lady.

THE RAY: Scratch one tank.

RED TORNADO: It's not like the
Reich to give up so quickly.

It sucks, I wanted to punch
more Nazis.

Don't worry. There's plenty
more where that came from.


That's not good.

Super not good.

BLACK CONDOR: Overgirl.

I calculate decent odds for the
five of us against Overgirl.

Unless, she brought friends.

You just had to say that.

Looks like the whole gang
is here.

Come on, we have to give
the refugees cover.




Get me in close.
I've got an idea.


THE RAY: John, now!


Argh!

Stay.

(RED GRUNTING)

Argh!


Argh!

Red! Get to Ray.
I'll deal with Overgirl.

Red?
Systems, sub nominal.

It's okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

Negative.
Total failure imminent.

You have to make sure
my neural cortex is destroyed.

Your cortex is you, man.
I can't.

Cannot chance Reichsmen
accessing data.

You must pr...
(SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN)


The android's brain,
give it to me.

Not a chance.


Surprise.


Missed me.

Missed me, again.
PHANTOM LADY: Miss this.


We can't hold them off forever.


Come on.
Crazy good timing.

Red Tornado's gone.
He gave me his cortex.

Argh!
Darrel!

Give us the cortex.

Get out of here.
I'll hold 'em of.

No, John, don't.

Go.

(THE RAY GRUNTING)



I'm going to enjoy
killing you, most of all.



Go.

Get to safety. We can't let
them get Tornado's cortex.

I'm not leaving you behind.

I'm not giving you
a choice, bro. Go.

Subtitles by explosiveskull

Did your new landlord
give you a reason

for the eviction?
No.

A week after
he bought the place,

we saw an eviction notice
on our door.

Just us. No one else
in our building.

We're the only Muslims.

Don't pack your bags yet.

We'll send somebody in
to investigate.

Thank you.

I don't want to pull my kids
out of school

and everywhere else in the
neighborhood is so expensive.

<i>My brother, Michael, was my age
when he died.</i>

That was eight year ago.
He was a marine.

And he was killed by an IED
in Afghanistan.

He gave his life,
trying to make the world

a better and safer place.

His sacrifice inspired me
to devote my life to making

a difference too,

by ensuring that everyone,
regardless of race,

religion, or gender,
has a safe place to live,

which is why we're asking you
to vote to expand

fair housing laws to cover
even more people,

like those military veterans,
and those in the LGBT community.

What do you think?
Uh...

Maybe you should switch
to decaf.

Come on, John, I'm serious.

So am I. You need to loosen up.

You've gone over your speech
100 times,

like, I've got it memorized.

I just want it to be perfect.

Don't sweat it. And I mean that
in its literal form,

like, I can smell you
from here. It's so bad.

The big shots are here.

It's go time.

Actually, John's going to do
the presentation.

He says he's got it memorized.

Lie, total lie. He's gonna crush it.
It's gonna be great.

My brother, Michael,
was my age when he died.

I'm gonna stop you right there,
Mr., uh...

Terrill. Ray Terrill.

I'm afraid we have some bad news.
After some thoughtful consideration,

we've decided to shut down
your department.

Shut us down?

I ran on a platform of tax cuts,

and the money has to come
from somewhere.

You can't close
our whole department.

People rely on us.

Let's be honest.

The communities you're talking
about, didn't vote for me.

I'm focusing on the ones
that did.

Hey, whoa.

You put that down too fast, it's
just gonna come right back up.

So what?

It's not like we have jobs
to go to tomorrow.

At least you and Jenny
put up a fight.

I... I just stood there with
my mouth open, like an idiot.

You weren't an idiot.

And it's not like our bitching
accomplished anything, anyway.

Some fights you just can't win.

Case in point.

I honestly don't know what's
more pathetic, though, like,

your mom's use of emojis

or the fact that you're 22 and
still live with your parents.

JOHN: (CHUCKLES) No, no, no, no.

I have a winner. It's that you still
haven't come out to your family.

Oh! We've been over this.

And it never makes
any more sense, at all.

You know how conservative
my parents are.

I've got to go about it
in just the right way.

Waiting until you've figured
out the perfect way,

is just an excuse
to procrastinate.

You're becoming
a procrastor-faker.

You're procrastinating
and faking, it's not working.

If I'm procrastinating,
it's for a good reason.

They're still disappointed I didn't
go into the Military like Michael.

Then why not just move out?

When I find a new job that
let's me help people,

that pays the bills, I will.
Then move to Sweden.

We'll get you
a Swiss Army knife,

take you to Albert Einstein's
house, it will all work out.

Not all of us have trust funds from
great-grandparents who invented diet soda.

You know I'm counting my blessings
every day, don't judge me.

Yeah, speaking of,

a handsome stranger's been over there
staring at you for the last 10 minutes.

Uh, no.

Oh, come on, just talk to him,
he's cute.

I may not be gay
but I have eyes, like I'm...

He's handsome, look at him.

Look at those eyes.
No.

I'll make weird squawking noises
if you don't,

Okay?
Please, not again.

Loud, obnoxious,

publicly embarrassing
squawking noises, if you don't.

This is your moment.

Hi.
Hello.

Sorry, I just realized
that I forgot to park my car.

Could you give me a minute?

Dude! Really?

Help yourself out right now.

(SLOW INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING)

Everything looks great, Mom.

Thank you, sweetie.

Robert, dinner's ready.

Raymond.
Dad.

Dig in, while it's hot.

How was work, kiddo?

How's that pretty girl
you work with, doing?

Jenny?

Um, she's fine.

She's just so lovely.

Need to find you
a girl like that.

Actually,

there's something you guys
need to know about me.

I wasn't exactly planning
on telling you tonight.

It's been a bit of a day
and, uh...

And I'm unemployed.

You lost your job?

They're shutting down
our department.

Oh, Ray.

Well, maybe this is a blessing
in disguise.

Maybe this is the push you needed
to get yourself a real job.

You know, like when your brother
lost that football scholarship

and decided to join the Marines.

RAY: <i>Well,
that was a total disaster.</i>

I don't even know
what I was thinking.

Who comes out
to their parents over meatloaf?

John, I'm gonna
have to call you back.




Help. Help.

Just hang on.

Hang on, I'm calling 911.

(DIALS)
(GRUNTS)

What the hell?



What just happened?



John, you think I could
swing by real quick?

RAY: <i>And when other me died</i>

his body blew up into like 1,000 beams
of light which went right into me.

I think I'm okay though.

Oh, come on, John.

The longer it takes you to say
something, the crazier I think I am.

I don't think you're crazy.

I think you're
a really good liar.

I mean you said other me
with such a straight face,

like, I almost believed you.

It really happened.

Where do you think I got this?

The flea market?

You know my grandma has a
paperweight just like that.

Exactly like that.


Whoa!

Okay, maybe not exactly
like that.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What's going on, Ray?

How should I know?

It's your weirdo paperweight
from crazy town.

This is exactly what
you should know.

<i>If subsystems are functioning
properly, this is Earth 1.</i>

Actually, I think there's
only one Earth, dude.

What are you talking to?

<i>There are thousands of different
realities in a multiverse.</i>

<i>I am an artificial life form
from a world designated Earth X.</i>

<i>Earth X's history
deviates from yours</i>

<i>in that the Axis powers
won World War II.</i>

Holy...

Crap.

Seriously?

<i>I am one of a group of freedom
fighters who opposed the Axis forces.</i>

RAY: That's other me!

And that guy looks like you.

Oh, thank God I'm not a Nazi.


I look good though.

I look good.

<i>My neuro-cortex contains information
vital to the resistance</i>

<i>including the location
of our base of operations.</i>

<i>No doubt the New Reichsmen are searching
for it at this precise moment</i>

<i>which is why
it must be destroyed.</i>

Won't that like kill you?

<i>My reserve power is already
being depleted.</i>

<i>I have not much time left.</i>

<i>Destroy the cortex,
save the world.</i>

<i>Goodbye, Ray.</i>

(POWERS DOWN)

Whoa.

Seriously?

How are we supposed to
destroy this thing anyway?

Like, run it over with a car?

I don't have a car.

And even if I did,

technology from another Earth?

way too cool to destroy.

But, dude, the hologram said
maybe we shouldn't...

Exactly. A talking hologram?

That asked you
to save the world.

Hello.

Fine. I'll destroy it.
Stop looking at me like that.

Seriously, why are you
looking at me like that?

What's going on?

I was gonna ask you
the same question.


Wait. When other you blew up,

he could've transferred some
photo kinetic energy to you.

What? I minored
in physics in college.

Don't look at me like that.

Like radiation?

Well, sort of.

But instead
of giving you cancer,

it made you one of those
meta thingies.

A super hero.

What? Are you crazy?

I'm not a super hero.

You're floating in my
apartment wearing a costume.

Speaking of,

do you know how to get down or are you
just going to stay up there or what?

Let's see.


You could probably
use some practice.

(RAY GROANS)

You never liked
that chair, did you?

Not really.

Great.


But I did love that TV.
What are you doing?

I'll get you a new one.

Uh... When I have a job.

Well, you know,
next time break a lamp.

Okay? I don't think I'll need any more
of those while you're around anyway.

Like, you've gotta
take it easy.

Cute.
Look, if you wanna test your powers

can I recommend somewhere
like not my apartment?

Good idea.

You know, if Michael
could see me now

with these powers,
he'd be so jazzed.

Jazzed? What about the cortex?

Aren't you worried
about those Super Nazis?

I'll get to it.

They're in a whole other
dimension or whatever.

I think we got some time.

(GUNS FIRING)

Doll Man is dead.

We're still searching for Phantom
Lady, Black Condor, and Vibe.

What about The Ray?

No sign of him.

But Vibe opened a breach for
him just before he escaped.

And we think he took
something with him.

Red Tornado's neuro-cortex.

That'll contain
all his memories.

Including the location of the Freedom
Fighters' base of operations.

Ready our forces.

Tell them to prepare
a final strike.

Once we find the base, we can eliminate
the last of the resistance forces.

(BIRDS SCREECHING)

JOHN: Whoa! What? Really? What
did those geese ever do to you?

That was out of line.
Sorry.

Maybe you could do the firework
shows next Fourth of July.

That ought to be cool. That
will give you something to do.

Ha! That'd be
one way to pay the bills.

But seriously.
This is so cool. I'm like...

Light Man.
Seriously? Light Man?

I think seriously no.
All right, try flying again.

Okay.

THE RAY: Whoa! Okay.

(BIRDS QUACKING)
What's up? Sorry about before.

First night with superpowers.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Oh, no. Oh, no. Whoa!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!


Welcome back.

Your earth-bound friends
missed you.

(CHUCKLES EXCITEDLY) Watch this.

What are you doing?

But isn't it cool?

Did you just vibrate
the atoms in your body?

I have no idea.
But it felt super weird.

And I think you missed a spot.

This is so freaky.

all better. What should I do next?

I think I got an idea.

Okay. Who's this stupid
meta-human responsible

for dragging me away from
my vino and <i>Buffy</i> marathon.

I picked up a resonance burst
from an alternate Earth.

Someone crossed over in the past
couple of hours near Tulsa.

Please tell me it's not
another version of Wells.

I'm finally getting used
to the one we have.

Well, the latest one we have.

I can't tell who it is.

The burst disappeared
almost as soon as it arrived.

Maybe they're
masking themselves somehow?

Or you know,
they're no longer with us.

<i>I doubt it. Check out the
radiation levels over Oklahoma.</i>

Whoa! The only thing that could
emit that kind of light is...

Nuclear material.

Or a meta-human.

What is this? Are we celebrating
me getting superpowers?

Shh. Just say it
a little louder.

Okay, I don't think
the whole bar heard you.

And we're not here
to celebrate, okay?

No.
Uh, yes. Get over there.

Superpowers did not make me
less prone to word vomit.

Show him you can fly.

a great conversation starter.

Definitely not.

Also, back at the bar again,
on a Wednesday?

Hello, alcoholic.

JOHN: <i>He's here
with his friends just like you.</i>

If having superpowers
doesn't build your confidence,

nothing will.


I'm gonna grab
a different drink.

Hi, I'm Ray.
Hey, Ray.

Oh, that rhymes.

Uh, sorry. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
That was dumb, wasn't it?

I'll try not to pass judgment
till your second sentence.

What's your name?
Jacob.

Nice to meet you, Jacob.

So weird, my glass
just broke like that.

Must've been fate, or, you
know, cheap shot glasses.

(WOMAN SCREAMS)

MUGGER: Give me your wallet. Now.
(WOMAN CRYING)

Just give him your wallet.
(CONTINUES CRYING)

Go find help, I'll stay here.

Well, are you sure?
Just go.

Now, if you'd gotten a man
to walk you home,

you wouldn't be
in this situation.

Give the wallet back
and apologize.

Son of a...
Do it!

Why the hell should I?

THE RAY: <i>That's why.</i>



Was that so hard?

MUGGER: (SHOUTING) Help! Help!

Somebody, help.

(MUGGER GRUNTING)


THE RAY: Eat your heart out,
Justice League.


THE RAY: You gotta watch your
speed around those curves.

RAY: The food looks amazing.

I think you look amazing.

WOMAN: Help. Help.

(WOMAN GRUNTING)
Ray, we've gotta... Ray?

Sorry, dropped my fork.

What did I miss?

(SIREN WAILING)

Please, save my son.

We've still got
two more of them.


Don't be scared. I got you.

(SIREN WAILING)

Thank you.

Ray?

Hey, buddy.

You hear about that
beam of light guy?

That's just an urban legend,
isn't it?

Nope, turns out he's real.

Tulsa has finally got
its own superhero.

Seems like a real hottie, too.

RAY: <i>How can you tell
if he's moving so fast?</i>

JACOB: <i>Ooh, you're jealous.</i>

I don't think I can fit it all.

How's that look?

Bam! Triple points.

<i>Come back from that, dude.</i>

Read 'em and weep.

Oxyphenbutazone.

What the hell is that?

Thank you
three years of pharmacy school.

I win.

<i>We need to make sure,</i>

<i>our city is full of the
kind of people we want.</i>

<i>The kind of citizens,
we can be proud of.</i>

What's your
favorite kind of fish?

Mine is the seahorse.

See, I've always felt,
the seahorses were the,

kinda...

You talk too much, handsome.

If you don't get in that plane,

you'll regret it.
Maybe not today.

Maybe not tomorrow.

But soon.
And for the rest of your life.

You know, just for the record,

I wanna go ahead and say that
this is a terrible idea.

You've already told me that.
No.

No, I believe
I said "bad idea."

And upon reflection
and recollection,

I'm gonna upgrade it
to "terrible".

Come on! Don't you think
he'll listen to The Ray?

I'm sorry, the what?
The Ray. My code name.

I thought you were
going with "The Laser."

I thought better of it.

What thought? I mean,
you just took your first name

and slapped "The"
in front of it.

There's no thought in that
at all.

Be right back.

Sorry about the window.

Or not.
What?

What's going on here?

I have some thoughts
in your budget.

The fair housing department?
Great program.

Fully funded. Okay?

Better yet, triple it's funding.

You're that guy.

I'm that guy.

So, what's it gonna be,
councilman?

I'll triple the funding.

Smart move.

Oh.

And I have a few things
I want you to bring up

at the next
city council meeting.

Yes, sir.
Great.

Really looking forward to your
press conference, tomorrow.

COUNCILMAN: (ON TV) <i>Which is why in
addition to strengthening protection</i>

<i>for religious minorities,</i>

You threatened
the city councilman.

No, I didn't. I just

made a pitch
as Tulsa's new superhero,

and he thought
it was a good idea.

<i>No person should be
fired or evicted,</i>

<i>simply for being who they are.</i>

<i>I'm proposing a new law</i>

<i>protecting the rights of
LGBT workers and renters.</i>

And I might've threatened him
just a little.

Ray!

Not overtly.

Just, you know, implied.

And it worked.

We're fully funded again.
We're back!

I know that's a look
of total disapproval

but I can't quite
put my finger over on why.

Hmm... Let's see.

Well, leaving out the fact that you
just blackmailed a city employee,

what about the cortex?

It's in the bottom of my sock drawer.
What about it?

You were supposed to destroy it.

Instead of saving cats
out of trees.

I haven't saved a cat, yet.

It's on my superhero
bucket list, though.

And I try, by the way.

See?

I've shot light beams at it.

Dropped it from the sky.

What am I supposed to do?

It's totally indestructible.

What if those Nazis
come looking for you?

You haven't done anything
about that except

bust up a few crimes

Improve your love life and

and threaten a politician with, what
I can only assume was bodily harm

So strange.

Well, I'm ever so sorry if I
was enjoying myself for once.

That's not what
I was trying to say.

This is the first time.

First time in my life,

I feel like I'm living up to
Michael's legacy.

You did not play the dead brother
card on me just now, did you?

It's not a card. It's the truth.

I may be busting up a
few crimes as The Ray,

but for the first time,
for the first time,

I'm making a difference.

A real difference.

That's what Michael
inspired me to do.

I thought you'd be cool
with that.

(ALARM BLARING)

I thought you took care
of the security alarm?

Must have been a backup line.

If we get pinched...

Don't worry, the cops won't be
here for at least five minutes.

THE RAY: I wouldn't be worrying
about the cops if I were you.

MAN 1: Holy crap,
it's that light guy.

I prefer "The Ray."

Drop your weapon.

THE RAY: Smart guy.

What's with the smirk?
You like going to prison?

(GUN FIRES)
(GROANS)

MAN 2: Looks like you're
cornered, golden boy.

(BOTH GRUNT)

Oh, well,
that escalated quickly.

(SIRENS BLARING)

I'll take that as my cue to go.

wasn't part of the package.

(SIRENS WAILING)


Come on, Ray,
where are you, bro?

If I were waiting for a pizza,
it would be free by now.

On second thought, I'm not gonna
think of pizza when I'm this hungry.

OVERGIRL:
We could help with that.

The Reich provides prisoners
with two square meals a day.




(CONTINUES GRUNTING)

(GRUNTS)
(VIBE GROANS)


BLITZKRIEG: He's running
some kind of multiversal trace,

tracking The Ray's trajectory.

Give him a hand with that.

(COMPUTER BEEPS)
Got him.

OVERGIRL: <i>I'm less interested in
him than Red Tornado's cortex.</i>

Well, looks like
they're both on Earth-1.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

MR. TERRILL:
You almost done in there?

Yeah, just give me a sec.

What were you doing in there?

Nothing.

You okay?

Yeah. I, uh, hurt myself
playing pick-up basketball.

I didn't know
you played basketball.

Yeah, I mean, John and some other
guys from work. No big thing.

That's what I like to hear.


(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Sorry, got to take this.

All right, son.

Okay, think I'm
out of earshot now.

Hmm, no offense,

but I kinda got over sneaking
around parents after high school.

Don't worry,
I've gotten really good at it.

We still on for tonight?

Yeah, I'll meet you there?



Hmm? (CONTINUES GROANING)

Um, I guess I'll see you there.


What the hell?


I'm just saying
it would really suck

if we kidnapped the wrong guy.
(RAY GROANS)

No, no, no. We didn't kidnap him.
We're recruiting him.

CURTIS: <i>Would still
suck though.</i>

Where am I? What's going on?

I see he's awake.

I can't believe
you tranq-darted him.

It was
a tranq-flechette, actually.

Wait a sec. I know you guys.

Really? Was it the masks and
colorful outfits that gave it away?

Don't mind him. He likes to
bust the chops of the rookies.

Rookies?

We keep an eye
on emerging heroes. Metas.

Seemed like a good time
for us to meet.

What he means is you've been using
your powers in public quite a bit.

You know about that?
How do you know about that?

We do our homework, Mr. Terrill.

Raymond Terrill.
Born March 1995,

graduated from
Central State University 2017.

His brother, Michael,
died in 2009.

Lives with his mother, Grace,
and father, Richard.

You still live
with your parents?

We'll come back to that.

It sounds like you could still
use some training

in the proper
use of your powers.

And we've got some
experience in that area.

(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

Whatever training
we're talking about,

it's gonna have
to be on the job.

What's going on?

That was Mari McCabe.

Trouble in Detroit.


That never gets old.

I think I'm gonna be sick.

Keep it together.

THE FLASH: Um, guys.

When Cisco said
military prototype,

I think what
he really meant was...

CURTIS: A giant robot.

Isn't this, like, the coolest?

VIXEN: <i>Well, that's
one way of looking at it.</i>


But that thing's already
destroyed three city blocks.

Well, we need to keep it
from being four.

Waiting for an invitation?

Yeah. Right.

You guys probably run headfirst
into danger all the time.

But, like, uh,
how often do you make it back?

I've never run
a statistical analysis.

<i>Plus, I've also never
fought a giant robot.</i>

(MACHINE GUN FIRING)










(WOMAN WHIMPERS)


(WOMAN SCREAMING)

Do you think
the cable's gonna hold?

I made them. They'll hold.

We need to herd it
towards the web.

And now are we
supposed to do that?

I think I got an idea.

It's working.

He's headed towards the net.
Get ready.


(ENERGY POWERING DOWN)

Next time, aim your blasts
in a tighter grouping.

Wow! How about a,
"Nice job, kid"?

That was his "Nice job, kid."

I'm Mari, by the way.

Ray. That's actually my name.

And my code name.

I don't think
you really understand

the whole
secret identity thing.

Seriously, Ray,
great job.

Particularly for your
first giant robot fight.

There's gonna be more?

Maybe. That was some
quick thinking in the field.

But you need
to hone your skills.

And now, he's gonna
offer to train you.

Shh. He doesn't like it
when you steal his thunder.

Well, if you're offering,
the answer is yes.

You're offering, right?

I guess I have to, now.

Thank you!

(BELL TOLLS)

Uh, I gotta go though.

It was great
to meet you guys.

I'll see you soon.

I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

Sorry, I'm late.
Got caught up with...

With your secret life?

My secret life?

Wtih your parents,

who don't know who you are.

They know who I am.

They just don't know...
That you're gay.

They're very conservative.

So were mine.

They got over it.

You can't stay
in the closet forever.

You don't know my parents.

My dad used to get
so embarrassed

whenever I screwed up as a kid.

He thought I needed to learn
how to be a man.

You're 22.

They've probably
figured it out, already.

Maybe.

Every time my mom thinks
"maybe," she looks terrified.

Like she's waiting for me
to admit it

so she can send me to
conversion camp or something.

So, you'll never tell them
about anyone you're dating?

Ever?
I don't know.

Because I don't wanna be
some dirty little secret

waiting in a bar to see
if you'll show up.

This is fun, Ray,

but if you can't be honest
about who you are,

I don't think you and I
are gonna work out.

JACOB: <i>If you can't be honest
about who you are,</i>

I don't think you and I
are gonna work out.

Come on, Ray. Focus!

Ray! Clear your head.

JACOB: <i>It's 2017, man,</i>

you can't stay
in the closet forever.

Ray, focus!

I'm trying.

Hey!

Focus!
It's hard with you barking at me

and, you know,
shooting arrows and stuff.

If you get distracted in the
field, even for a moment,

that could mean the difference
between life or death.


Magical light beams
from a parallel universe

are a little more complicated
to aim than arrows.

I don't care
what you're shooting.

Precision all comes down
to one thing.

What's happening up here!

Something's holding you back and
it isn't magical light beams.

What's going on?
(SIGHS)

I guess I'm a little distracted.

I just broke up with someone.

Actually, he broke up with me.

I'm sorry to hear that.

He said I wasn't being honest
about who I was

Was he right?
A little.

Your powers are a part of you.

If you can accept
who you are,

maybe you can accept them.

Until you do,

you'll never be able
to truly master them.

(UNLOCKS DOOR)

Raymond? Where
have you been?

Um, out with
some new friends.

I lost track of time. Again.

What kind of friends?

The "not bad" kind.
Don't worry.

Ray.
Yeah?

If there's anything
you want to tell me about,

the people you spend your
time with, you know you can.

They're good people.

They're trying to make
the world a better place.

Like Michael.

And these friends are...
Other men?

Some of them.

Okay. I love you, Ray.

I love you too, Mom.

What I mean to say is,

I love you for
everything you are,

without conditions.

Do you understand
what I'm saying?

(LOUD CRASHING)

Ray?

Stay downstairs!

Is that an earthquake?

Get downstairs with Mom!

I looked all over
the world for this.

Turns out I was just looking
in the wrong world.

You look just like him.

a pansy like him as well?

I'm genuinely curious.

Is this world devoid of
Aryan perfection?

Yeah. You could say that.

Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God...

Argh!

(THE RAY GROANING)

Surrender the cortex and I won't
make you suffer before you die.

(THE RAY GROANING)

Final warning.


(THE RAY GRUNTING)

Do you even know
what this is?

It is the means for me
to tear out

the resistance root
and branch.


Oh, my God!
Look at your face.

You were right.
Wait, what happened to you?

You were right about the cortex.

I should've tried harder to destroy it
or asked the other heroes for help.

Slow down.
What happened?

One of those super-Nazis
from the other Earth.

She came
to my parents' house.

Oh, my God!
Are they...

I checked.
They're fine.

I... I... They think it
was just an earthquake.

In Oklahoma?
I don't know. Fracking?

But she took it. The cortex.

<i>She said she can use it to
kill thousands of people.</i>

I should've listened to you.
I should've...

Hey! It's okay. It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.

No, it's not!

I was so caught up in being
the big-shot super hero.

I was... I was so excited
to be like Michael.

To feel like I was
helping people for once.

I wasn't thinking.

Look, people make mistakes, Ray.

You can't beat
yourself up about it.

Besides, that's
the super-Nazi's job, right?

No? Too soon?
Alright, look, you screwed up.

We all do. And I'm sure that goes
double for new super heroes.

Point being, you pick yourself
up and you try to fix things.

How do I fix this?

I turned my back on an entire
world of people in danger.

You'll figure
something out.

You always do.

Really?
Really. Look,

I get it.
I can't imagine

what it's like to grow up in
the shadow of a dead war-hero.

<i>But you somehow talked yourself
into this weird idea that</i>

<i>you do the right thing
because of Michael.</i>

You don't, man. You do the
right thing because of you.

<i>Because you're that kind of person.
That's who you are, Ray.</i>

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

MR. TERRILL: <i>What do you mean
"you have to get out of town."</i>

RAY: Just for a little while.

Does this have anything to do
with what happened to your face?

A little.
But I've got it handled.

Well, your Mom says you've got some...
Some new friends.

Did you get uh... Well, did you get
attacked because of these friends?

You mean, did I get
jumped because I'm gay?

Because I didn't get jumped.

But I am gay.

Well, gay means happy, right?

Uh, yeah. Huh. Sometimes.

What your father's saying is, so
long as you're happy, so are we.

We're proud of you. And whoever
you wanna... You know.

You grew up right.

You sure you don't wish
I'd grown up to be Michael?

MRS. TERRILL: <i>Don't be silly.
Michael was an exceptional person.</i>

But so are you.

We've never wanted you to be
anyone other than our Ray.

Thanks, Mom.

I love you guys.

Hey, Cisco.
Whoa, dude.

What happened to your face.

Nazi super girl.

Come again?

Short version is I don't
have a lot of time.

I got my powers
from another Ray

from another Earth where
the Nazis have taken over.

Okay. I get it.
Very funny. Barry!

Cisco, I'm serious. I need to
find a way to get to Nazi Earth.

And I heard
that's your jam.

So, you want me to send you
to an Earth overrun by Nazis

including a Nazi Supergirl?

Uh, yeah.

My life is so weird sometimes.

CISCO: <i>If what's going down on Nazi
Earth is as serious as you say,</i>

<i>you shouldn't be heading
over there without backup.</i>

I can't let anyone else get
hurt because of me, Cisco.

Does that include Barry killing me when
he finds out I let you do this alone?

You don't have to tell him.
Fair point.

I have to say it.
It might sound weird.

But I can't believe
I'm missing out on Nazi Earth.

Cisco, you're seriously the only
person who wants to visit Nazi Earth.

Yeah. That's probably true.

All right. Your power's left you
with a vibrational reminiscence

of your doppelganger
from Nazi Earth.

Which I was able to use
to attenuate the breach

so you end up in the right
world in the multiverse.

Yeah, I didn't understand
any of that.

I think I'm sending you
to the right Earth.

But you'll still be
in Central City.

What's your plan
when you get there?

Find other members
of the Resistance

before I get killed
by super Nazis.

Good plan.

I got a look
at their secret base earlier.

I think
I can find it.

Here's hoping.

Be careful, Ray.
I will.

If you see my doppelganger,
tell him he's awesome.

Never go Nazi.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

Freeze!

PHANTOM LADY: Don't shoot!

He's on our side.

BLACK CONDOR: Ray!
We thought you were dead.

Yeah. About that.
I need to talk to you both.

I can't believe
Ray died on your Earth.

I'm sorry
I couldn't save him.

We have other problems if Overgirl
has Tornado's neural cortex.

The New Reichsmen
know where we are.

If they did they would have
moved on us already.

They're probably just
marching in their forces.

They know this is their chance

to wipe out
the entire resistance.

I came here to help.

I think you've helped enough by letting
Overgirl obtain Tornado's cortex.

I'm sorry. I messed up. But your
friend gave me these powers,

and I wanna make things right.

We are short-handed.

Okay then.
What are we gonna do?

We need to abandon the base.
And go where?

If we split up
they can't kill us all.

Splitting up would mean
the end of the Resistance.

So would the New Reichsmen
attacking us here.

At least we'd be alive.

We can't give up.

This moment, right here
is our last stand.

We can't fight them all.

They outgun us
and out power us.

Winning is no longer
an option. Only survival is.

Our parents, our grandparents,
they started this fight.

What would they say
if they were here?

I'd say they'd say
they wanted us to live.

We don't have
a battle plan.

(ALL ARGUING INDISTINCTLY)

I don't know much
about this Earth.

But I know something
about my Earth.

My Earth isn't like this one.

THE RAY: <i>My Earth isn't perfect. It...
It's nowhere close to perfect.</i>

But at least there's hope. And I'm
here to tell you that it's possible

that freedom is possible.

<i>You can be exactly who you are
without having to live in fear.</i>

<i>I can help you
imagine a better world.</i>

The world you can have if
you're willing to fight for it.

THE RAY: I'm willing to fight for it.
Because I've seen it.

And I'll fight like hell
to show it to you.

So will I.
Who's with us?

(ALL CHEERING)

We've got incoming!

<i>Come on!</i>


We need to set up a perimeter.

Just point me
in the right direction.

You shouldn't be here.

I think this is exactly
where I should be.


You should've stayed
in your own crappy universe.

Ray!

Stay on Black Arrow.

Stop!

We'll never stop.

Let's see what your new friends
have to say about that.

No!

Whatever she says,
don't listen to her!

This is very simple.
With his powers,

the Reich can open breaches,
all across the multiverse.

We will raise the Nazi flag
over infinite Earths.

Stand down
and we'll spare yours.

<i>Think of your family.</i>

Think of your friends.

I am thinking of them.

And they want me
to tell you to go to hell.

Doesn't sound all that
unpleasant.

Kill them all.


SOLDIER: Fall back!

You heard Overgirl.
No one gets out alive.

We're trapped.

Thought you could use
a little help.

We've got cover. Engage.

Let's see you outrun this.

What the?


Why are you fighting?

This isn't your world!

This isn't your fight.

You threatened to breach
your way to my Earth. Remember?

And even if you didn't

I'd still kick your ass.

The Resistance
is on its last legs.

You're only prolonging
these peoples' suffering.

You don't belong here.

You're wrong.

I've spent my whole life, trying
to make the world a better place.

But it's this world
that needs me the most.

Thanks, kid.

Is that all you got?

Gonna feel that tomorrow.

He's out cold.

Finally!

Ray!

Come on, Ray!

Fight it. You got the power.


We might actually survive this.

Is that Overgirl?

Move out.

That was...

Impressive.

What about the rest?

Out cold and locked up.

We won?
Not entirely.

We have to pack your stuff.
We have to leave.

The Reichsmen
may have been finished.

But the Reich is
as powerful as ever.

This location
is no longer secure.

We have to leave.
That's my fault.

Your Ray told me to
destroy the cortex

so the Riechsmen
wouldn't get it.

I didn't try hard enough.

I wasn't ready to be a hero.

No one ever is.

But you're one, now.

Our Ray would be proud of you.

Yeah, and he'd be
a little grossed out

by the sentimentality.

You ready for me
to vibe you back to your Earth?

No.
What?

Like I said,

it's my fault,
you're compromised.

And even if it wasn't,

it's like I told Nazi Supergirl.

I'm needed here

more than I'm needed back home.

Cool.

Besides, it's like
it's meant to be.

Back on my Earth,
we all work together.

As freedom fighters?
No,

but heroes.

Well, government employees.

But still, we help people.

Actually, I think my John's
kinda got a crush on you.

Yeah, I think there are
a few differences

between our Earths.

I like dudes, dude!

Interrogation report from the
Reichsmen we captured, ma'am.

We have a location
for the chancellor.

Who's that?
Leader of the Reich.

Not for long, he's not.

It's go time.
