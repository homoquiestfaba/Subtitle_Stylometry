 - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: Moving vans
           and boxes.

     Packing and unpacking.

 That's pretty much been my life
 for as long as I can remember.

     My name is Davis Pell.

    Because of my mom's job,
 we've had to move around a lot.

  I only just moved to America
         from Australia.

       When you're always
          the new kid,

        it's pretty hard
        to make friends.

        Most of the time,
 it's just me hanging by myself.

 Never having a chance to settle
    down can be a bit lonely,

       but I've found ways
        to keep things--

          - MAN: Uh-aw!

     - DAVIS: --interesting.

          Couldn't be.

          - MAN: Oh-ah!

               - â™ª

              - Ah!

             - Oooh!

    - Rayzon, you followed me
           to America?

      - I would go anywhere
     to finally destroy you,

           Davis Pell.

     Even suburban Seattle.

        - Let's end this.

       - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS:
          It's possible

     I'm not the coolest guy
          in the world.

 In fact, most people would say
       I'm kind of a dork.

       And you know what?

               Uh!

    They might have a point.

      I mean, look at this.

 I'm having an imaginary fight,
         and I'm losing.

        But not anymore.

      I'm at a new school.

   Heck, I'm in a new country.

        Things this year
       will be different.

   I'm going to have friendS.

      I'm gonna be popular.

       Maybe I'll even get
     a girlfriend for once.

       Whatever it takes.

       Starting this year,

        Davis Pell isn't
  going to be a loser anymore.

               Uh!

     - I think you got 'em.

        - You didn't see
      all of that, did you?

   - I think I can safely say

    I didn't see much as you
         and Rayzon did.

Rayzon.

             - Yeah.

             - Yeah.

    So...you live next door?

      - No, just a big fan
        of porch swings.

     Travelling the country
   porch swing to porch swing.

            - I hope
     that works out for you.

             - Wait!

           Don't move!

             Shhhw.

    There was one behind you.

       - Thanks, Katniss.

          - No charge.

     - Hey, I was wondering.

  Maybe because I'm new in town
          and all that,

     that maybe you could--

  - Uh, uh, uh, turn it around,
         ninja warrior.

        I don't date boys
     who play make-believe.

        - Right, got it.

    You're probably wondering
    about the kaleidoscopes.

       My mom gets me one
       every time we move.

    Told you we moved a lot.

    I've been collecting them
       since I was a kid.

          I don't know
     what it is about them.

   I guess I just like having
        something to show

       for all the places
        that I've lived.

   You also might have noticed
         that sometimes

 I like to imagine stuff the way
        I'd want it to be

  instead of how it really is.

   You know, like daydreaming.

Let's just say that my daydreams

    are little more colorful
           than most.

               - â™ª

          - Hi, honey.

           - Hey, mom.

  - Are you excited to meet all
  your new classmates tomorrow?

           - Excited?

     Um, have we met before?

     I'm sure you could have
  plenty of mates if you tried.

             - Yeah.

          Let me guess,
      if I just be myself.

Oh, honey,
        it's high school.

 Nobody's really themselves yet.

              - Mm.

   - Things will look brighter
         in the morning.

               - â™ª

      - Yeah, you're right.

  Things do look much brighter.

       Here's your lunch.

      - Weird health food?

 - With all your allergies, yes.

           Oh, and...

             Ta-da!

          - Your lucky
       first day sweater.

           - No, mom,
   I thought you burned that.

        - You've worn it

        on your first day
    for the last five years.

        - And every year
  has been a complete disaster.

 It kind of defeats the purpose
   of having a lucky sweater,

         now doesn't it?

         It's horrible,
     and it's too small, ma.

        I can't wear it.

         - No, it's not.

          It's perfect.

    Your grandmother made it.

  - And Nana is legally blind.

 Mom, okay, I'm not wearing it.

            I'm not.

               - â™ª

        - Can I help you?

         - I'm supposed
       to get a schedule.

   - I'll pull it up for you.

         - Hi, everyone,
       I'm Caitlyn Crisp,

reminding you that Forksley High
      is recycle friendly.

     We can save the planet.

     We only have one Earth,
            you guys.

      So let's all pitch in
       and treat it right.

      The Earth likes you,
      and I like you, too.

               - â™ª

         - What's that?

        - Your schedule.

     You just asked for it.

          - Thank you.

   - Pull it together, Davis.

        You can do this.

          Sorry, Nana.

    - CAITLYN: Hi, everyone.

    It's Caitlyn Crisp again.

       And on this edition
      of "Caitlyn's World,"

      I'll be talking about

        the hottest event
         of the season--

  this fall's Sweetheart Dance
        at Forksley High.

         You don't want
     to miss a minute of it.

 That last blog that you posted
    on your site was amazing.

            - I know.

     And I love that people
         love my videos.

But still, I can't help but feel
 like there's something missing.

       - What do you mean?

     - People in this school
           look to me

       to make their life
        more fulfilling.

   And I just keep giving them
        more of the same.

There's got to be something new.

       - I want adventure.

              - Uh!

          - Excitement.

      - Maybe even danger.

              Ugh!

               - â™ª

         - DAVIS: Okay.

         Let's do this.

       - CAITLYN: I don't
        know what it is.

    But I do know one thing.

 It's out there waiting for me.

         - Who are you?

           - I'm new.

       - Oh, the new guy.

 You care to introduce yourself
    to the rest of the class?

              - No.

      - Good, take a seat.

               - â™ª

               - â™ª

      - Here, let me help.

            - Thanks.

         - Cool accent.

           Is it real?

  - Why would I fake an accent?

        - To sound cool.

    - You think I sound cool?

        - See you around.

  There's definitely something
     interesting about him.

    - GIRL: Love the accent.

     - How did you do that?

           - Do what?

             - Hey.

          Who are you?

         - I--I--see ya.

       - Who was that guy?

         - I don't know.

    - CAITLYN: How did he get
     all the way down there?

          - A vampire?

       - I'm telling you.

  He didn't have a reflection.

         I didn't see it
        with my own eyes.

       He could be exactly
      what I'm looking for.

        - What about Bon?

           - The Bon's
      a little bit simple.

   Not you, Bon, another Bon.

       He's so mysterious.

          - Look at him
    trying to eat human food.

           - ALL: Aw.

         I have an idea.

     - Bon, does that pizza
       have garlic in it?

             - Yeah.

           - Perfect.

        I saw you weren't
       enjoying your food.

  You should have this instead.

    - Wow, that's really nice
         of you and all,

         but I--I can't
       actually eat that.

          I'm allergic.

        - To the garlic?

       - Uh, well...yeah,
         and the cheese

       and the yeast and--

   basically the whole pizza.

   - Yeah, but one little bite
           can't hurt.

    - Yeah, I mean, one bite
      can't hurt that much.

      I mean, how allergic
        can I really be?

            - Mm-hmm.

    - Uh...it was delicious.

             Thanks.

     - No, I don't like it.

          - What, Bon?

   - The poster, I don't like.

           - Uh, yeah,
     I don't like it either.

    - Well, I guess you guys
  don't need me here for this.

    I'm just gonna head out.

    - We should take it down.

             - Yeah.

       - Wait, wait, guys.

 We can talk about this, right?

 We can talk about this, please.

  - Did you see how he reacted
         to the garlic?

        - Everybody saw!

          What happened
      to Bon and the guys?

             Oh, no!

          - Oh my gosh.

    - O-M-G, he's sparkling.

    Pics or it didn't happen.

 - You have to send that to me.

          - Oh my gosh.

             - Wow.

 - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: Oh, please.

          Kill me now.

         - Come with me.

 - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: Looks like
     I'm gonna get my wish.

  She does plan on killing me.

     Probably leave my body
          in the woods.

          - Do you feel
 like you can be honest with me?

          - Uh...sure.

          - You're pale
    and you dress strangely.

      - Oh, you're starting
        with the honesty.

     - Tell me what you are.

       - What do you mean?

        - You're awkward.

  You really don't say anything
          interesting.

       - Oh, you should be
     a motivational speaker.

       - But I find myself
          drawn to you.

        - What was that?

  - You don't have a reflection
         in the mirror.

   You can't eat normal food.

         And you sparkle
       in direct sunlight.

          - I sparkle?

         I'm sparkling.

            - Say it.

           - Say what?

     - I know what you are.

            - You do?

          - Yes, I do.

        Say it out loud.

      - Uh, I--I--I'm pale.

         No reflection.

 Uh, sparkling...like a vampire.

              - Uh!

           It's true?

             - Sure.

    Please promise to meet me
        by the first tree

     at the school entrance
        at 8:30 tomorrow.

             - Okay.

Oh, boy.

            I'm dead.

        You look so cool.

            - Thanks.

         - Let's go in.

        - We just walk in
   like in front of everyone?

            - Mm-hmm.

            Come on.

     - CAITLYN: Oh, hi, Bon.

         - BON: No way.

          - Is it true?

          - Is it true?

       What do you think?

        - This is totally
     the most amazing thing

  to ever happen at this cool.

      It's true, Davis Pell
    is a really, actually...

           a vampire.

             - Psst.

 Does this happen to you a lot?

    Do you go to new schools
        and people think

 you're a supernatural creature?

   Oh, were you Rocky Raccoon
      at your last school?

     - What makes you think
    I'm not really a vampire?

    - You act like you're 14,
            not 400.

   You go out during the day,
 which pretty much goes against

      the most basic tenant
        of vampire lure.

  And you are in no way suave.

            Oh, yeah,
    and vampires aren't real.

          Don't worry,
 I'm not going to say anything.

           - Why not?

     - Because you're making
   everybody look like idiots.

      I kind of love that.

        But some advice.

          You're going
  to have to step up your game

  if you want to keep this up.

               - â™ª

              - Ah!

               Ha!

       This isn't working.

        Wah, wah, ha, ha!

          Ugh, no, no.

               - â™ª

           - Hey, Vi.

    Thanks for helping me out
           with this.

You know, I've been up all night
        trying to figure

   - Well, I decided if you're
     going to make a mockery

  of my school's social order,
         then I want in.

And you definitely need my help.

         - That's true.

        - Now, I'm going
  to get you looking the part,

 but you've got to get yourself
       sounding the part.

           Talk to me
  like you're really a vampire.

             - Okay.

I'm totally a vampire.

        - What was that?

       - It was a vampire.

          - For someone
   who already has an accent,

   you're terrible at accents.

    - Okay, well, first off,
 I'm not the one with an accent.

            You are.
              - Oh.

         - And secondly,
just tell me how I should sound.

             - Okay.

       The modern vampire
   is more of a cross between

       a constipated model
  and a freshman poetry major.

             - What?

    - Okay, repeat after me.

    You wouldn't understand.

   - You wouldn't understand.

   - More like you don't want
     to deal with anything.

      - Should it really be
         this much work

   to seem like I don't care?

         - For you, yes.

     - Thanks for helping me
   pick out all these clothes.

   - No charge, Edward Cullen.

           Okay, how's
    the vampire voice coming?

              - Oh.

    You wouldn't understand.

            Not bad.

             - Yeah?

  So what else is there to know
         about vampires?

           Like I know
      all the regular stuff

 like wooden stakes and sunlight
       and all that stuff.

         But what else?

   - There's a couple things.

     For instance, vampires
    are terrified of rabbits.

        They're incapable
  of singing "Happy Birthday."

         Oh, and this is
        an important one.

      If you beat a vampire
      in a staring contest,

   it renders them powerless.

      - A staring contest?
            - Mm-hmm.

            - Really?
            - Mm-hmm.

     - I don't believe you.

        - Fine, you don't
       have to believe me.

          Here's proof.

             - Doh!

              Okay!

        - Okay, you win.

    But seriously, we really
      need to figure a way

   we can sell this at school.

         - Don't worry.

       I have a few ideas.

      Now you got the hair
        and the clothes.

        Okay, let's start
        with the basics.

    Wear these at all times.

               - â™ª

           - Perfect.

    - He showed me his fangs.

        - GIRL: It's just
          like Edward.

             - Oops.

       - GIRL: Oh my gosh,
          he's so cute.

     - Okay, vampires' eyes
   are always changing colors.

     So you're going to need
  to wear these contact lenses.

      - GIRL: There he is.

          Turn around.

        Look at his eyes.

               - â™ª

      - And on this edition
      of "Caitlyn's World,"

         Forksley High's
very own bloodsucker Davis Pell.

  - VI: Some vampires can fly.

     So we've got to get you
         off the ground.

             - Look!

               - â™ª

Oh, yeah.

        - There's no way.

               - â™ª

      - How did he do that?

               - â™ª

        - CAITLYN: Today
      on "Caitlyn's World,"

     I have a story you can
  really sink your teeth into.

           Davis Pell,
      undead and loving it.

        How old are you?

       Time...is for those
         waiting to die.

           - So true.

            So true.

    And this week's winner of
the smile contest is Davis Pell.

 Thanks to all my new followers
     for logging on to vote.

   Looking towards the future,
      will you be attending

     Forksley High's annual
        Sweetheart Dance?

     - If you'll be my date.

          - Of course.

               - â™ª

     â™ª So get your game on â™ª

    â™ª Get, get your game on â™ª

        - This guy comes
        into our school,

 steals are girls, our friends,
        our pizza slices.

              Why?

     Because he's a vampire.

    Well, I'm a quarterback.

      And I was here first.

             - Yeah!

         Let's go, baby!

              Whoo!

    - I was more complaining.

    It wasn't really anything
      to get excited about.

        - You were using
       your huddle voice.

  - Is that what I sound like?

     - Hey, I have an idea.

        I have this uncle
    who's way into vampires.

      He can maybe help us.

           - Call him.

             - Okay.

     But I have to warn you.

      He's a little weird.

           - Call him!

            - Hello?

      - BOY: Uncle Derrick?

              - Oh?

 - Is this...Baron Von Awesome?

 If what you're saying is true,
    and I have been noticing

  a number of signs indicating
    just such an occurrence,

    I will stalk the monster
       and I will kill it.

 - How do we know you can do it?

       What's your story?

           - My story?

    I was born in a graveyard
          at midnight.

             - Whoa.

     - And still an infant,
        I was abandoned.

     I found myself nursing
       from a mother emu.

 She took me in, and her family
      raised me as her own.

   They taught me how to hunt.

        And how to kill.

     - What does any of this
    have to do with vampires?

      - My skills are vast,
          I assure you.

 I have the yellow belt in nine
 different forms of "ka-ra-tay,"

   which technically makes me
   a third degree black belt.

        And I've defeated
      the game Castlevania,

    And I have seen the movie
     "Van Helsing" 47 times!

     And I hated that movie.

    - That--that's all great,

 but how is it going to help you
          get this guy?

         Mark my words.

 I will hunt this creature down
    to the ends of the world.

  There is nowhere he can hide.

          - Finding him
       won't be a problem.

          - Excellent.

       - Which one is he?

       - He's right there.

          - Excellent.

     - So, what's your plan?

        - This container
      is filled with water

      caught from the base
  of the Carpathian Mountains.

       It is renowned for
 its vampire-killing properties.

     When I spill it on him,
    it's going to be poof...

      goodbye, vampire boy!

      - Sssh, sssh, sh, sh.

              Sssh.

             Hello!

        - Can I help you?

             - Yeah.

 I am the water delivery person.

          And I'm here
      to deliver the water.

    - TEACHER: No water here.

        You probably want
      the teacher's lounge.

    - Or perhaps--or perhaps
       it was right here!

              - Ah!

         Evil creature!

    Drink this up you nasty,
    smelly thing from beyond!

terror.

              Yeah.

              - Mm.

 I guess we're gonna need a mop.

           - Hey, Vi.

       - So, this is what
      your lair looks like.

   I expected more candelabras
       and flowy curtains.

      - Ha, ha, very funny.

      - So...how do I look?

   - Not to feed your already
      rapidly growing ego,

   but you do look relatively
      presentable tonight.

You're so sweet.

             - Mmm.

        So...what's with
       all the telescopes?

    - They're kaleidoscopes.

 - Why do you have all of them?

 - Oh, well, my mom gets me one
       every time we move.

    - Wow, you do move a lot.

 Yeah, I know it's weird, but it
    makes my mom happy, so...

          and actually,
  I--I kind of like them, too.

       They're pretty much
  the only things I really have

       from all the places
        that I've lived.

         - I don't think
      they're weird at all.

          I like them.

          They're cool.

            - Thanks.

             - So...

 You got your dancing shoes on?

I don't know
         about that one.

        - Oh, of course.

         Get over here.

          - What? Why?

    - I'm going to teach you
       how to slow dance.

        - What makes you
         think that I--?

              Okay.

 I don't know how to slow dance.

      Okay, so you're going
    to put your hands there.

             - Yeah.

 - And I'll put my hands there.

    You rock back and forth.

     You can start to spin.

             - Okay.

   - And you can occasionally
        look at the girl.

Yeah.

Yeah.

    Am--am I doing it right?

             - Yeah.

               - â™ª

          - MOM: Davis,
     your girlfriend's here.

             - Bye.

             - Hey.

         You should come
      to the dance tonight.

   - Definitely not my scene.

     - There's a good chance
 I might make a fool of myself.

    - Slightly more tempting.

           - But alas,
      I don't have anything

      quite darling enough
  to wear to such an occasion.

Well, I'm sure you'd look good
      in anything you wore.

        Anyways, see ya.

   - CAITLYN: You look great.

        - DAVIS: Thanks.

            You, too.

               - â™ª

      - Let's go sit down.

               - â™ª

  - You are the most beautiful
     girl I have ever seen.

      - In all your lives?

Yes.

   In every single one of 'em.

       - That's not fair.

         That's my girl.

             - Okay.

          You know I am
      the head cheerleader.

      - Quiet, Not Caitlyn.

             - Ugh!

           - Hey, hey.

          Check it out.

             Hello.

           - Oh, hey.

       Have you see Davis?

              - No.

  - Hello, everyone, can I have
     your attention, please?

   It is now time to announce
     the Sweetheart Couple.

     Now there were a lot of
 really cute couples this year.

       But unfortunately,
     there can only be one.

           This year's
 Mr. and Miss Sweetheart are...

  Caitlyn Crisp and Davis Pell!

            - And now
    for the spotlight dance.

               - â™ª

         - Ooh, my gosh,
        I love this song!

   I have to go get the girls.

               - â™ª

           â™ª Buckle up
       and hold on tight â™ª

      â™ª All abroad on this
    endless ride to forever â™ª

        â™ª Until forever â™ª

 â™ª Every night I feel so alive â™ª

      â™ª These are the signs
     of the endless night â™ª

           â™ª Forever â™ª

        â™ª Until forever â™ª

                â™ª

        - Why aren't you
         doing anything?

   - This guy is a clever one.

     My plan is to study him

      and then destroy him!

     - Oh, you are so fired!

               - â™ª

           â™ª Forever â™ª

        â™ª Until forever â™ª

          â™ª And ever â™ª

          â™ª And ever â™ª

               â™ªâ™ª

       - CAITLYN: Tonight
        was so much fun.

    - Yeah, it was the best.

   Caitlyn, there's something
  I need to talk to you about.

     - Oh, no, not tonight.

       Uh, I'm exhausted.

  Let's talk about it tomorrow,
              okay?

          - No, no, no.

         It's important.

  And I've been meaning to tell
    you this for a while now,

     I just didn't know how.

       - You want to make
   our relationship official?

              - No.

No, I mean, yes, of course I do.

        It's just that--

        - No, no, no, no.

        I'm too excited.

  I have to go tell the girls.

Come over to my house on Friday,
  and we'll go over everything,

              okay?

             - Yeah.

          Okay, great.

   - GIRL: Do you really think
         that Caitlyn's

  going to go through with it?

       - Why wouldn't she?

          Wouldn't you?

      It's like the coolest
   thing to happen to anyone.

  - I can't believe Davis Pell
 is going to turn Caitlyn Crisp

         into a vampire.

         I'm so jealous.

 - Caitlyn is telling everybody
  that you're going to turn her

    into a vampire on Friday.

             - What?

     Oh, come on, she can't
     actually believe that.

   - Uh, you're talking about
 the girl that already believes

   you're a real-life vampire.

       She's expecting you
     to bite her on the neck

  and turn her into a vampire.

    You can't let this go on.

          It's too far.

     - I tried to tell her.

        - But you didn't.

 - I thought we were having fun.

  - Davis, you're the only one
    who's having fun anymore.

        - Oh, I see now.

         You're jealous.

      You think I'm jealous
           of Caitlyn?

              - No.

  I think you're jealous of me
       for being popular.

    Why would you be jealous
           of Caitlyn?

          - No reason.

        No reason at all.

 Have a great time Friday night.

       - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS:
        Okay, here we go.

   - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: I don't
  know what I'm worrying about.

  I mean, she likes me, right?

       I can just confess,

         and we can put
     all of this behind us.

          Hey, Caitlyn.

       I've got something
       to confess to you.

    I'm not really a vampire.

          - Oh, Davis.

    I don't care about that.

       I like you for you.

          Now kiss me.

  - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: Come on,
    Davis, hold it together.

    Just tell her the truth,
  and everything will be fine.

 Besides, she can't really think

      I'm going to turn her
         into a vampire.

             Uh-oh.

          It looks like
  you've got a nice place here.

           If I could
     actually see anything.

             - Come.

           - Caitlyn,
   there's--there's something

 I've been meaning to tell you.

           - Bite me.

      - Uh, well...you see,

        there's something
 that I really need to tell you.

  - Ssh, don't spoil the moment
       with your talking.

           Just do it.

             - Okay.

      Ugh, Caitlyn, there's
  a whole bunch of people here.

            - Mm-hmm.

     Better not disappoint.

        - I have to pee.

            - Ready?

            - Mm-mm.

       - How does it feel?

       - It doesn't really
       feel like anything.

        - Uh, that's how
     it's supposed to feel.

    That means it's working.

    That means it's working!

       - GIRL: You didn't
         even bite her.

      - He can't turn her.

          - May--maybe
      it just didn't take.

         I'll try again.

        Let me try again.

         - It's ketchup.

           I knew it.

          He's a liar!

          He's a faker!

         - DAVIS: Dude,
       it was just a joke.

    Guys, it's just me Davis.

    It's just me Davis, guys.

       It's just me Davis.

       Guys, I was joking.

         It was a joke.

 We can talk about this, right?

     Can't you take a joke?

I guess he
   wasn't a vampire after all.

            Come on.

               - â™ª

       - That is just what
     he wants you to think.

       His time will come.

          - Hey, honey.

DAVIS:

           - You okay?

Yeah.

    I'm just gonna go to bed.

         - Are you sure
        you're all right?

  - DAVIS: Yes, mom, I'm fine.

    I know it's tough on you
            sometimes

       with all the moving
        and the changes.

       I am sorry you have
to go through that all the time.

             - Okay.

             Thanks.

        - Do you know why

    I get you a kaleidoscope
       every time we move?

           - Why, mom?

    - Because you look in it,
       and it's beautiful.

        But the slightest
      turn of the wheel...

     can change everything.

      Thing is, that change

     can be beautiful, too.

         Sometimes maybe
       even more beautiful

       than it was before.

      - This change stinks.

            - I know.

You know, with everything that's
   happened since you arrived,

 I'm sure there's something here

     you think is beautiful.

               - â™ª

       - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS:
      Have you ever really

   not wanted to go to school?

  Like you have a zit or a test
      you didn't study for?

            - Loser!

  - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: This was
 like all those times combined.

             - Liar!

       - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS:
     Times like 40 billion.

             - Jerk!

    - Okay, it sounds great.

  - Okay, stop it right there.

       Yeah, no, add that
       to the second clip.

        - Like a vampire.

          - It's true?

             - Yeah.

    - CAITLYN: Play it back.

  Please promise to meet me by
        the first tree--

         - Hey, Caitlyn.

   - What are you doing here?

       - I don't remember
 there being any cameras there.

    What are you working on?

           - Nothing.

 It has nothing to do with you.

 - I'm not too sure that's true.

      - Would you just go?

    I can't even look at you.

  - DAVIS: Okay, I just--I just
       wanted to tell you

   that what I did was wrong,
    and I'm a complete goon.

        And...I'm sorry.

          - No, Davis,
      I'm sorry...for you.

      You're a sad person,
       and you should go.

             - Yeah.

  - CAITLYN: Get back to work.

    I'm gonna check my site.

Oh my gosh!

    Ten thousand subscribers!

       I've gone national!

     - Oh, I just lost one.

          - Psst, hey.

       - What do you want?

     Need more footage of me
       acting like a jerk?

 - No, I've got plenty of that.

  I want to give you something.

          - What is it?

          - Just watch.

   It'll help you, believe me.

    - Why are you helping me?

I too know what it's like to try
    to be someone you're not

    for a woman's affections.

           - For Rita?

          - I like her,
    but I hate video cameras.

             - Cut.

     - BOY: Yeah, I got it.

   - You better have, because
     I'm not doing it again.

DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: Here it was,
         the ugly truth.

         And no daydream
     could ever cover it up.

    What I saw in that video
        was so shocking,

        so mind blowing,
        so life altering,

 if I ever hope to show my face
      at that school again,

     I had to show everyone
      what I had just seen.

    I had to fix everything.

            But how?

               - â™ª

      - MAN: Whoo-ha-ha-ha!

    - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: I had
      set a plan in motion

    for the Creepy Carnival.

            And I had
     just the right costume.

        Actually, it was
        my only costume.

             - Ooh.

       - DAS GH:
       Now it was go time.

     But first things first.

               - â™ª

           - Dracula?

             Really?

       - Don't be afraid.

   I'm not actually a vampire.

       - I gotta get back
      to the haunted house.

           - No, wait.

 I just wanted to tell you that

         when I started
       doing all of this,

     all this pretending...

 I thought it'd be the only way

        that I'd finally
     get some real friends.

   - I'd say you made plenty.

              - No.

            Just one.

 Here, I want you to have this.

       Anyways, I'll--I'll
       talk to you later.

   "Sometimes I pretend things
  are what they really aren't.

         "But with you,
    I don't need to pretend.

     "You make real life way
    better than make believe.

             Davis."

         - Hi, everyone.

 And welcome to Forksley High's
        Creepy Carnival.

    Tonight, we'll be showing

  "The Revenge of the Creature
     from the Black Lagoon."

   - What are you doing here?

 - Everyone, I've got something
          to tell you.

  I have something to show you.

             - Liar!

             - Liar!

            - Loser!

            - Loser!

             Lame-o!

       Those are all names
  that I deserve to be called.

   And those are just the Ls.

        I owe all of you
       a sincere apology.

     Except for one person.

         Caitlyn Crisp.

  - Caitlyn Crisp has used and
 lied to every single one of us.

        And I have proof.

   This is what Caitlyn Crisp
           really is.

               - â™ª

     - Okay, that's--that's
  obviously not Caitlyn Crisp.

      That is the Creature
     from the Black Lagoon.

       Looks pretty good.

    - I don't know what this
hurtful liar is trying to prove,

      but we can all agree
         it's pathetic.

             - Cut.

        Did you get that?

     - BOY: Yeah, I got it.

      - Is that thing off?

     - BOY: I turned it off.

             - Good.

   You know, I just can't stop
 thinking about all these idiots

      who actually believe
   this vampire stuff is real.

     What a bunch of boosers
         and followers.

             - What?

     - Are you helping Davis
       take down Caitlyn?

            - Kinda.

        - I didn't think
       you had it in you.

  - Of course all the students
       at school are sheep

      who will do anything
          I say anyway.

         Oh, no, no, no.

         Bon, stop him.

             - Wait.

       - It's Bon, again.

             Oh, no.

  When are you going to realize

           you're just
     high-school arm candy?

         What an idiot.

            End call.

              Okay.

               Ah!

 - This is your beloved Caitlyn.

       She has made a fool
        out of all of us.

   - CAITLYN: That's not true.

         The great thing

        about high school
  being a popularity contest--

          the rules are
     written by the winners.

    That's not what I meant.

          Oh, stop it!

              Agh!

 - I don't know how he did this.

 But you guys know I would never
   say anything bad about you.

     You're all my friends,
        and I adore you.

          - Hey, guys.

              Guys!

             Listen!

          Hey, listen!

  - This is high school, okay?

       No one really knows
        who they are yet.

       And we're all still
  trying to figure things out.

    I mean, you guys hated me
      like two minutes ago.

     And I don't blame you.

       Because I pretended
    to be something I wasn't

   so that you would like me,
        and I'm so sorry.

  But take a look at yourselves
          for a second.

  Is it any different for you?

I mean, Caitlyn Crisp is no more
   Miss Perfect than I am a--

         - Bloodsucker!

         - Look, that's
     our water delivery guy.

         - Who are you?

    - I am your arch nemesis.

             - Okay.

    - I'm Baron Von Awesome,
        a vampire hunter.

       - Dude, that's, uh,
        Stewart's uncle.

         He still thinks
        you're a vampire.

      He wants to kill you.

             - What?

        I think it's been
     pretty well established

 that I'm not an actual vampire.

          I was getting
    way meaningful down here.

  It is not wise to ignore me,
            creature.

       Especially when...

     I have your girlfriend.

              - Vi!

   - Where does that door go?

         - Uh, the roof.

               - â™ª

 - Come, demon, face your fate!

  - What are you talking about?

         There's no way
      I could get up there.

    - Use your dragon wings.

  - This whole not really being
         a vampire thing

  just isn't sticking with you,
             is it?

 - Uh, enough of your treachery,
          bloodsucker.

        I am coming down.

         - Bloodsucker!

          - I told you,
       I'm not a vampire!

               - â™ª

           - At last!

               Ah!

  With such speed and agility,

        how can you claim
      to not be a vampire?

          - You got me.

      - I'm the real deal,
     and I'm real dangerous.

  And right now, I'm real mad.

        So I'd advise you
      not to challenge me.

          Give up now.

         - Arm yourself!

             - Okay.

              - Ah!

               Ah!

    - Wait, wait, wait, wait!

              Uh...

   this is pointless, slayer.

          You know that
      there's only one way

 to render a vampire powerless.

          - Of course.

       A staring contest.

           - Exactly.

  And I accept your challenge.

     On the count of three.

           One, two--

            - Three!

  - You fought bravely, human.

            - I see.

        There's humanity,
       even in the undead.

     I will spare your life.

     I will spare his life!

          - Uh, thanks.

               Vi!

          I forgot Vi!

   - Oh, move, out of the way!

     - Go get her, Dracula!

               - â™ª

    - You just made the team.

           - Finally.

        - You're welcome.

          - So are you
     going to untie me now?

         - Well, maybe.

But I'm thinking you're probably
   blaming me for all of this,

       and that you might
        actually hit me.

         - That's true.

 - But I might also be grateful
        that you saved me

     and give you that kiss
    you've been looking for.

 - You don't need arms for that.

           - So cool.

       - I'm really sorry
   for everything that I said.

             - Yeah.

       - Oh, oh, psychic.

 - So, we're like a couple now,
              huh?

  - Yeah, don't get used to it.

    You're not even my type.

          - How's that?

        - Well, I'm more
        into werewolves.

BOTH:

        - Oh, by the way.

 Thank you for the kaleidoscope.

        - You're welcome.

               - â™ª

               - â™ª

       - DAVIS: Oh, let me
     show you how to dance.

   - VI: Now this is my scene.

       - â™ª Hold on tight â™ª

          â™ª All aboard
     on this endless ride â™ª

  - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: So maybe

     I'm not the coolest guy
  in the world, but who cares.

      I made some friends,
       and I got the girl.

         The right girl.

        And they all seem
     to like the real Davis.

       And you know what?

    That's pretty cool to me.

         - â™ª On and on â™ª

      â™ª It goes on and on â™ª

      â™ª It goes on and on â™ª

     â™ª It goes on and on â™ªâ™ª
