        PAUL McCARTNEY:         
   <i> The fans have been great</i>    

      <i> yeah, the fans here</i>      
        <i> are fantastic.</i>         

<i> I'm really looking forward</i>     
<i> to playing for them again.</i>     

    Paul, before I let you go   

    here you are in the middle  
    of a hugely successful      

                world tour with 

        your new band, Wings.   

            Does it bother you  

     that so much attention     
        is still placed         

        on the question         
   of the Beatles reuniting?    

      Well, to be honest,       
         that question          

     does get a bit boring      

      um, but I understand      
        you have to ask.        

  The Beatles are the Beatles   

        and a tough act         
      to follow, you know?      

 Um, I just keep making music.  

  What about your old partner,  
          John Lennon?          

                After all these 
                years of being  

        such a highly           
        visible personality--   

            the various peace   
            demonstrations      

        the naked album covers, 
        and what have you--     

      he now seems to have      
  completely shut himself off   

                from the world. 

  That's something you'd have   
     to ask John, isn't it?     

  So I take it, the two of you  
          are still...          

I do not speak                  
for John.                       

   I'm not trying to be rude.   

  I just can't speak for John.  

  Well, then, let me ask you--  

                Paul McCartney--

      is there any chance       
         of the Beatles         

                    getting back
                    together?   

   Well, Tom, you never know.

           YOKO ONO:            
       Hi, John. It's me.       

       Are you sleeping?        

    Listen, I'm afraid this     
 whole transaction is becoming  

     a bit more complicated     
      than we'd expected.       

  Maybe we can leave tonight,   
  but maybe not till tomorrow.  

          Sean's fine.          

      He's sleeping, too.       

       I love you, John.        

    Do you want me to put on    

                    some music? 

          Yeah, sure.           

                        Lovely. 

     (<i> switching stations</i> )     

            DEEJAY:             
   ...rockin' you on another    
       gorgeous afternoon       

       in the Big Apple.        

      It's Beatles weekend      
        all weekend long        

on the Mighty Maxx, and like all
 of you out there, we're hoping 

  those Beatles reunion rumors  

      are not just rumors,      
    if you know what I mean.    

Man, wouldn't it be great to get
those guys back together again? 

  Should I change the station?  

       No, no. It's okay.       
          Leave it on.          

    ...the new smash single     
 from Paul McCartney and Wings. 

      We premiered it here      
   a couple of weekends ago--   
       Leave it, Donald.        

       "Silly Love Songs"       

         and if you're          
  the 96th caller at 555-MAXX   

 you'll score the hottest album 
 in the country-- that's right  

 America's brand-new number one 
 <i> Wings at the Speed of Sound.</i>  

        Congratulations.        

          Ah, thanks.           

      ...and don't forget       
        Paul's big tour         

     first time in the U.S.     
         In ten years.          
        It's been worse.        

   We're going to have plenty   
    of tickets to give away     

  for those two sold-out shows  
    next month at the Garden    

         so stay tuned.         

   Now here's Peter Frampton    
      to show us the way.       

           Hey, mate.           

              Hmm?

     Yeah, nice one, yeah.      

  This is Paul McCartney here.  

     Shag a pig, it's Paul.     

    Hello. You're listening,    
          it says here          

   to New York's one and only   
 pure source for rock 'n' roll. 

      (<i> doorbell buzzing</i> )      

      Help me. I'm trapped      
    inside this little box.     

              MAN:              
      Good afternoon, sir.      

      You have a visitor.       

         Friend or foe?         

        I believe he is         
      an old friend, sir.       

He says he wishes               
to surprise you.                

      Well, how do I know       
   he is who he claims to be?   

 I... I can vouch for him, sir. 

He is a familiar face.          

              Sir?              

      Check him for drugs,      
       then send him up.        

     Take Mr. McCartney up      

to see Mr. Lennon.              

                    Nice work.  

Have a pleasant day,            
sir.                            

                    Cheers.     

It's an honor                   
to meet you, sir.               

         Oh, thank you.         

        At the end

           Hi, John.            

  The ghost of Christmas past.  

  Are you going to let me in?   

    Aren't you one of them?     

          (<i> laughing</i> )          

      Well, I used to be.       

    Now I'm just one of me.     

           All right.           

     Best let you in, then.     

Don't want you standing         
out in the hall                 

getting mobbed, eh?             

            Take your shoes off.

        Hmm?                    

                    Shoes off.  

        Yoko's not here.        

              Oh?               

    Can I get you something?    

          Cup of tea.           

This way here.                  

      Hope you don't mind       
      me surprising you.        

     It's too soon to say.      

         Where's Yoko?          

       Off buying a cow.        

            She won't be home   
            till tomorrow.      

    Bancha twig? Brown rice?    

                    Dandelion?  

           Whatever.            

        What about Sean?        

         He's sleeping.         

         In California          
      where the cows are.       

       Oh, that's a drag.       

    I was hoping to see him.    

      Is it okay to smoke?      

    Have you got one for me?    

You're very thin.               

        Hmm. Mother's got us    
        on a macrobiotic diet.  

    Mother?                     

                    Yoko.       

        So we're alone.         

             Yeah.              

            You, me

                I brought you   
                something.      

What's this?                    

            "Wings."            

       That's your band.        

            Mm-hmm.             

       Are they any good?       

      Judge for yourself.       

     Madison Square Garden      

                 two weeks time.

   I've already played there.   

        With Elton John.        

Hmm.                            

        Against me will.        

        Elton dared me.         

       Heard about that.        

            You did             
 one of our old songs with him  

                      I seem    
                      to recall.

   Yeah, and then I got sick.   

       You ought to come        

                    to the show.

        I'm pretty busy         

you know, Paul.                 

     Yeah, I can see that.      

  You might like it, you know.  

          (<i> coughing</i> )          

       So, you seen much        
     of the others lately?      

         Which "others"         
     are you referring to?      

      The other Be-a-tles.      

     Ex-Be-a-tles, rather.      

        Well, let's see.        

       Haven't heard much       
       of Beatle Harold.        

              Ta.               

Beatle George                   
rang up                         

      just the other day.       

         He was in town         
   making a guest appearance    

      with Monty Python's       
    Flying Circus on stage.     

      ¶ He's a lumberjack       
        and he's okay. ¶        

     I know that one, yeah.     

     Yeah, that one, yeah.      

       I'm supposed to go       
        into the studio         

with, uh, Beatle Ringo next week
   to play piano or something   

       on a song I wrote        
       for his new album.       

           Oh, yeah?            

Yeah.                           

 Don't know if I'll go, though. 

    I'd like to help Ringo,     
         but I just...          

I'm not geared up to going back 
        into the studio         

     you know what I mean?      

              You?              

   Haven't heard from George    
           in a while           

      but I talk to Ringo       
         pretty often.          

                You know, that  
                thing with Ringo

                     that sounds
                     like fun.  

                      You should
                      do it.    

                It's very white.

Did you bring me                
anything else?                  

   Well, first things first.    

     Are you allowed, son?      

      I won't say anything      
         if you don't.          

        Can I smell it?         

    Oh...                       

What is that?                   

                It's good stuff.

Oh, it smells good.             
Yeah, give us another smell.    

                Get away. Go on.

                 Stop slobbering
                 all over it.   

  So your record's number one   
      over here, you know?      

  Really? I hadn't heard that.  

         You know me--          
    don't pay much attention    

                  to that       
                  kind of thing.

        Oh, yeah, right.        

         So what do you         
      think of it, anyway?      

        Well, you know,         
    you'd think that people     

     would have had enough      
     of silly love songs.       

    Bloody impressive, man.     

       Muzak to me ears.        

           Piss off.            

    Good bass part, though.     

 You know, Paul, I always said  

you're an inspired              
bass player.                    

             I am.              

      And I don't need you      

telling me that.                

   How's it doing in Britain?   

    The album's number one.     

             Good.              

          The single's          
      not coming out there      

     for a couple of weeks.     

   You never know in Britain.   

     It might get beat out      

    by the Bay City Rollers     
       or some odd thing.       

    We're getting old, mate.    

    Speak for yourself, dad.

        You-- pretending        
   you didn't know me music.    

         Come on, Paul.         

You're the biggest bloody thing 
       since the Beatles.       

           Oh, them.            

Whatever                        
became of them?                 

        They all grew up        
      and became lawyers.       

        Can you believe         
  these bloody entrepreneurs?   

Old Sid Bernstein's             
offering us what?               

      What's it up to now?      

$210 million                    
to get back together.           

         It's obscene, isn't it?

It's amazing, really.           

They say we only have           
to perform together             
for 20 minutes.                 

Anything we want                
so long as we're                
all four together               

on the stage at once.           

        Yeah, right, just like  
        the old days, huh?      

              You know, we ought
              to take the money 

      and just stand there      
          looking grim          

 strumming out-of-tune chords.  

I wonder if it's                
in the contract                 

that we have to shake           
our heads about and smile.      

        No, there's more        
        money in it if we're    
        at each other's throats.

your recording contract run out.

Somebody told me,               
in fact, that, uh...            

       you said you might       
   never make another record.   

   It's no skin off my teeth.   

Off your nose,                  
you mean?                       

                No, off me back.

You're not serious.             

            No skin off me back?

No, I mean about...             

        You thought it was nose.

        Seriously, John.        

        Seriously, Paul.        

             What?              

             What?              

      I just want to know       
what's up with you, that's all. 

 You know, I'm out there making 
the rounds, talking to the press

     and the one question       
     they inevitably ask--      

        it never fails--        

             is, "Paul, will the
             Beatles be getting 
             back together?"    

                    You know    
                    what I mean?

              No.               

                       I'm sick 
                       and tired

      of having to answer       
   that stupid old question.    

 And-and-and the other thing... 

look, just tell them to grow up,
get on with their own lives     

stop living                     
in the past.                    

It's simple                     
enough.                         

    Yeah, that's easy enough    
         for you to say         

                  being shut    
                  off from the  
                  world and all.

           Believe me           

                      they don't
                      let up.   

            Besides             

                  they're always
                  going on about
                  the two of us 

       being in some kind       
       of horrible feud.        

    Like we're the bleedin'     
Hatfields and McCoys, you know? 

 Look, Paul, let's not be coy,  
           all right?           

If you've                       
come here                       

to reunite the Beatles,         
you can turn right back around. 

          Oh, hang on.          

       You don't honestly       
        think I came...         

Look, I don't care              

           you know.            

    I've given up the game,     
        all right, Paul?        

You know, I've been             
under contract to one           
wanker or another               

   since I was 19 years old,    
           you know.            

  I've finally gotten control   
        of me own life.         

I'm not                         
giving that up.                 

     Look, I'm going to go      
        into the kitchen        

   and get something to eat.    

    If you'd like to join me    

that would                      
be fine.                        

If you want to sit here and hum 
"It's Been a Hard Day's Night"  

        to your heart's content,
        that's fine as well.

          Hello, Sean.          

      Oh, he's a handsome       
         little devil.          

    Is this why you retired?    

 You still carrying that woman  
       across the river?        

          Come again?           

 Listen, will you shake this up 
          for a while?          

I've got an important phone call
            to make.            

            Will you shake<i> this</i> 
            up for a while?     

Yeah, I would,                  
but Yoko took the tweezers.     

                    What woman? 

Two zen monks were              
walking together                

   when they came to a river.   

       A beautiful woman        
       stood on the shore       

         and asked them         
if they would carry her across. 

            Of course, the monks
            weren't supposed    

                    to associate
                    with females

        but, nevertheless, one  
        of the monks carried her

            across the river.   

            Later, after walking
            many more miles     

     the first monk turns--     
        15-12, please--         

      the first monk turns      
  to the second monk and says   

  "I can't believe you carried  
  that woman across the river"  

    and the second monk says    

    "Are you still carrying     
  that woman across the river?  

I put her down a long time ago."

      Oh... tell me more,       
        oh, wise master.        

         Tell me more.          

           Hey, June.           

         Yeah, it's me.         

Listen, is everything all right?

         Yeah, I know.          

    Yeah, I got the message.    

       Well, tell mother        
       to give me a ring        

       when she's through       
    taking care of business     

           will you?            

                        Yeah.   

                Yeah, you know, 
                I'm fine, yeah. 

                Listen, will you

          put him on?           

            Sean...             

            Sean...             

                say, "Daddy."   

                        Sean?   

 I miss you tremendously, Sean. 

       Sean, daddy's got        
   a little surprise for you.   

   This here, Sean, is Paul.    

            Paul used to be     
            your daddy's partner

        a long, long, long time 
        ago, when daddy was     

      a miserable old king      

before mummy came to rescue him 

from unsaintly beasts           
and hypocritical ogres.         

          Hiya, Sean.           

         (<i> chuckling</i> )          

                    Hey.        

                How do you like 
                growing up      
                in America?     

 He's not even a year old yet,  
             Paul.              

            Shut up.            

 He says it's a bit of a drag.  

   Oh, well, that's 'cause he   
hasn't been anywhere, you know? 

        Sean, I hope...         

         he's laughing?         

                    Sean, I hope
                    that we get 

            to meet face-to-face
            someday... you know?

            Maybe we can sing   
            a song or two.      

     (<i> speaking gibberish</i> )

                Yeah, he would.

         June... yeah.          

        Listen, are you sure    
        everything's all right? 

                        Yeah.   

          Okay, okay.           

   Look, you have to promise    
to call me if anything happens. 

           All right?           

        Thank you, June.        

         Yeah, I will.          

            Bye-bye.            

So, you've

to take care of him...          

     to be a househusband?      

              Hmm?              

         You finished?          

          Yes, please.          

          (<i> dinging</i> )           

(<i> sighing</i> )                     

What are you bowing to,         
if you don't mind me asking?    

                Ideally, there's
                no difference   

                    between the 
                    one who bows

  and the one who's bowed to.   

Ooh, very "I Am The Walrus."    

          (<i> grunting</i> )          

         You all right?         

       My foot's asleep.        

You know, I have to say, though 

     it does really put you     

in a relaxed frame of mind,     
doesn't it?                     

             Yeah.              

It's been a while               

            for me.             

            Emerson.            

          What's that?          

"The reward                     
of a thing well done            

      is to have done it."      

   That's ludicrous, that is.   

        I'd never own up        

       to saying anything       
       so bloated as that       

      let alone commit it       
           to print.            

          You bloated?          

             Never.             

        So, you've taken        
    to memorizing the works     

   of the great philosophers,   
           have you?            

  I just like the sound of it.  

          "The reward           
      of a thing well done      

is to have done it."            

See...                          

 I'm not sure I entirely agree  
           with him.            

    I mean, I think it helps    

    to have some kind of...     
  public recognition as well.   

   Otherwise, how do you know   

if what you've done is          
any good?                       

         (<i> chuckling</i> ):         
     You're daft, you are.      

         (<i> laughing</i> ):          
             Am I?              

             Yeah.              

           I mean...            

     how many adoring fans      
          do you need           

    to know you're good, eh?    

        You got to say good-bye 
        to mummy and daddy.     

 Otherwise, you're just looking 
          for approval          

        trying to please        

      because it makes you      
          feel wanted.          

  And what's wrong with that,   
       I'd like to know.        

   Well, who are you, really    

 if all you're concerned with   
 is making other people happy?  

Why can't making people happy be
     a part of who you are?     

         Trying to make         
       other people happy       

 is like giving them a blanket  
or a piece of candy to chew on. 

           You know,            
 you-you got to stir people up  

                got to make them
                uneasy, you know

     make them miserable...     
  wish they'd never been born.  

      That's the only way       
        they'll wake up         

       and face reality.        

       And whose reality        
       do you want them         

      to wake up to, John?      

             Yours?             

   Everybody's in pain, Paul.   

            If you want to do   
            some real good      

            you ought to stop   
            singing silly little
            love songs, mate.   

    Just shut up for a while    

    and then, bloody scream.    

Listen                          

    I don't like screaming,     
       and if you ask me        

 there's more than enough pain  
         in the world.          

  So I don't see why you want   
    to go and make it worse.    

  Because it's<i> real,</i> you know.  

  It's not romantic bollocks,   
             mate.              

     Look, if you started       
     to feel your own pain      

 maybe other people would look  
         at you and say         

       "Gee, that guy was       
 really together," you know...  

    "Never caused any fuss.     

What's he going on about, here?"

You know, they'd really listen. 

Listen?                         

    Why should anyone listen    

          to you or me          
     screaming and moaning      

    about how bad things are    
       when we can go out       

   and make bloody good music   
           about it?            

 You don't seem to understand,  
           you know.            

          I don't even          
   recognize meself sometimes   

        until I'm aware         
      of that bloody pain       

          whether it's          
     me father walking out      

 or me mother not caring enough 

    and passing me off to me    
    auntie to raise, you know...

        and then when I do      
        finally get to know her 

  she goes and gets run over.   

     Just doesn't go away.      

        I'm 35 years old        

     and I still feel like      
   I've done something wrong.   

      That's heavy, John.       

    Yeah, it's heavy enough.    

    Listen, I'm going to go     
           for a pee.           

   I'll be right back, mate.

        Mashed potatoes,        
and don't skimp on the gravy... 

    From a fat waitress who     
    had a cold sore, and, uh... 

    who said her name was...    

             Boris.             

            "Boris"?            

             Boris.             

                        Doris.  

    Said her name was Doris     
 and asked where he was from... 

  And which way he was headed,  
              see.              

        (<i> tempo changing</i>

            PAUL:               
            You keep popping up 
            in me dreams lately.

             Yeah?              

  (<i> continues playing piano</i> )   

Mmm.                            

I'm not sure why.               

      All sorts of people       
 have been entering my dreams.  

   Mostly people who've died.   

Brian, Mal, me mum.             

    They're not bad dreams.     

       Actually, they're        
       kind of reassuring       

   especially when me mother    
           comes in.            

     I don't get to see her     
  that often anymore, you know  

         what with her          
      being dead and all.       

     Anyway, there you are      

    visiting me in me dreams    

and I always get                
the nagging feeling             

that there's something          

   you're trying to tell me.    

    What do you think it is     
    I'm trying to tell you      

    in these dreams, Macca?     

I don't know.                   

You know, I try to piece        
it all together.                

I mean, things are going pretty 
     well for me, you know?     

          It's just...          

     sometimes I feel like      
       there's so much...       

         so much stuff          
   that hasn't been resolved.   

    Do you know what I mean?    

            Mm-hmm.             

    Like what, for instance?    

       Well, you know...        

           the usual.           

The big things,                 
really... family.               

           The past.            

A lot of things                 
between you and me              

to be brutally honest.          

       (<i> playing piano</i> )        

I don't know.                   

Me dad died recently.           

                What? What of?  

      Bronchial pneumonia.      

 They say his last words were,  
"I'm coming to join you, Mary." 

  You weren't there with him,   
    then, when it happened?     

              No.               

    Linda and I were on tour    
         with the band.         

 Me dad died on March the 18th. 

 We were opening in Copenhagen  
        two days later.         

    That's got to be rough.     

  I mean, you two were close.   

             Yeah.              

         But, you know,         
      that's the best way       

  for me to handle it anyway,   
           you know?            

      Just to keep going,       
          otherwise...          

           of course,           
    it helps to have Linda.     

          How is she?           

She's great.                    

                    Yeah?       
Yeah.                           

                And the kids?   

     Great. They're great.      

     Back at the hotel now.     

    We're bringing the girls    
      with us on the tour.      

Did you know that?              

Yeah, so we can have            

 some semblance of family life. 

 That's actually what I'm doing 
        here in America         

  checking out houses to rent.  

   Do you want to hear a song   
I wrote for Stella, me youngest?

              No.               

     Were you born a prick?     

              Yep.              

     (<i> playing slow music</i> )     

                My old man died.

             What?              

           Recently.            

           Get away.            
         I didn't hear.         

      The bastard croaked       
      on April Fool's day.      

             Whoa.              

This is a bit spooky, isn't it? 

I mean,                         
our mothers died                

pretty close together           
in time.                        

             Yeah.              

What about you?                 

Where you there                 
when your dad...?               

The last I remember hearing, you
 kicked him out of your house.  

      Told him to get lost      
         or something.          

             Yeah.              

     It was his own fault.      

      Deciding to reappear      
  right when I'm in the middle  

 of doing primal bloody scream  
       therapy, you know?       

     It felt good, though.      

   Telling him to get stuffed   
       right to his face.       

      Strange, you know...      

     just before he died,       
     we spoke on the phone      

  and I actually heard myself   
       apologize to him.        

      I knew he was dying       

    so we were able to talk,    
            you know            

      before he kicked it.      

 It's good I got some warning.  

            I mean,             
   otherwise me last contact    

  would have been "piss off."   

 It sounds like-- I don't know  
   if you'd take it this way    

       but it sounds like       
        you forgave him.        

            Well...             

   what's to forgive, Macca?    

  I mean, he wasn't my father,  
            was he?             

     Not in any real sense.     

       He was a drifter.        

    He got drunk one night,     
         staggered home         

    and stuck it to his wife    
     before he passed out.      

   That was Freddie Lennon's    

     one great contribution     
         to fatherhood.         

  The rest was just misplaced   
    expectations on my part.    

     (<i> playing slow music</i> )     

                I never thought 
                you'd end up    

        with someone like Linda.

 What's that supposed to mean?  

        I always thought        
       you'd get yourself       

  a nice little English girl.   

      It's not necessarily      
      an insult, you know.      

    So what are you saying?     

 I'm just saying that I thought 
     I knew you pretty well     

  and I was surprised when you  
took up with this American girl 

    and made her your wife,     
          that's all.           

    Maybe you didn't know me    
as well as you thought you did. 

                    Maybe, yeah.

   Maybe I didn't know myself   
        so well, either.        

  It took me by surprise, too.  

      She's the best thing      
   that ever happened to me.    

   So don't go knocking her.    

Like you accepted Yoko with love
   and respect from day one.    

You were a royal asshole, mate. 

         Oh, all right,         
       now, listen, John.       

     Oh, look, actually...      

            I want to say this. 

           (<i> sighs</i> )            

   You and a lot of me other    
       so-called friends        

   caused us a hell of a lot    
      of grief back then.       

                She was the one 
                I chose to be   
                with, man.      

                    Couldn't you
                    see that?   

      How could I miss It?      

Listen, John                    

we were partners                
since we were kids.             

            Yeah? So I wasn't   
            a kid anymore.      

Neither was I.                  

I'm not saying                  
you shouldn't have              
been with her                   

but you brought her             
along with you                  

everywhere you went.            

She had her bleedin' bed        

brought into                    
the recording studio            

for God's sake.                 

  Look, Paul, when I met Yoko,  
      everything changed.       

      I couldn't care less      
      about being in some       

            little boy's club   
            anymore, you know?  

             Fine.              

 If you couldn't deal with Yoko 

      you had no business       
        dealing with me.        

     Well, that's just it;      
        where were you?         

    You bloody disappeared.     

        All of a sudden,        
  everything's John and Yoko.   

         Where's John?          

  You turned your back on us,   
           remember.            

Bloody right,                   
I was mad at her.               

I was really mad                
at you.                         

It was just easier              
to hate Yoko.                   

       Oh, come on, Paul.       

You just wanted the game to go  
on a little longer, that's all. 

                With Beatle Paul
                at the controls.

     You know, getting all      
 the "A" sides of the singles.  

      Made to feel special      

                by all your     
                society friends 

    who thought "Yesterday"     

     was the greatest thing     
          we ever did.          

Damn right, I was getting       
all the "A" sides               

'cause who else                 
was coming up                   

with any decent                 
competition?                    

It sure as hell wasn't you, and 
that was a group decision.      

        You were worried that   
        I was going to close    

            the gold mine down. 

'Cause you had                  
more important things           

on your mind, remember?         

            You needed me 'cause
            you were afraid     

        of being on your own;   

            that everyone       
            would finally see   

        who was the real brains 
        behind the Beatles.     

The real brains?                
Oh, that's a laugh.             

Obviously,                      
I didn't need you.              

I'm doing quite well            
without you now, aren't I?      

Yeah.                           
                        Yeah.   

            You and your        
            silly love songs.   

You're making cotton candy, man.

            Nobody takes you    
            seriously anymore.  

          Bloody hell.          

     At least I'm working.      

Not sagging off,                
sitting all day                 

      watching the telly        
      in some ivory tower       

  letting me life pass me by.   

        You don't know.         

           Screw you.           

   You think I'd rather form    
      meself a pop group?       

        See me face on the      
        cover of<i> Rolling Stone.</i> 

            You know, sell out  

     Madison Square Garden      

 just to prove that I can still 
           get it up.           

    I've got a son to raise.    

 If you want to waste your time 
     singing nursery rhymes     

            trying to hold on   
            to your fading youth

it's no skin off my teeth, mate.

        Look... John...         

    I realize how much Yoko     
          meant to you          

and still means                 
to you                          

and I'm sorry                   
for the way                     
I treated her.                  

    But don't you understand    
      what was happening?       

         Enlighten me.          

  That was a hard time for me.  

    When we were breaking up    

  and I was trying to hold it   
          all together          

and you were spending           
all your time with Yoko.        

    I felt like I was losing    
         me best mate.          

              Who?              

              You.              

We were never that close, mate. 

  You arrogant, lying bastard.  

      Do you have any idea      
         what it took?          

You have any idea why I'm here? 

         I don't know.          

       Why are you here?        

     I mean, you come over      
     uninvited, unannounced     

 after God knows how many years 

  and I'm supposed to be happy  
          to see you?           

                This isn't      
                Liverpool, pal. 

  I don't want you dropping by  

  like it's the good old days,  
            got it?             

      Fine. Then I'm off.       

             Fine.              

         (<i> door slams</i> )         

        Please take me back up. 

    Yes, sir.                   

                    You know... 

        What?                   

                        What?

What?                           
Out there?                      

                    Yeah.       

                    Why not?    

                We could both do

            with some fresh air,
            don't you think?    

All right.                      

Suppose I ought to show you     
around some here.               

Yeah. New York's cool, you know.

         Nobody's going         
  to hassle us here, are they?  

       Uh... right, uh...       

    what... what day is it?     

           Saturday.            

     Saturday, the... 18th.     

         No, the 24th,          
         you pillock.           

      Listen, is it going       
       to be a problem--        

      the two of us being       
      out there together        

            you know, getting   
            recognized          

       and all that crap?       

         Maybe for you.         
 I gave that all up, remember?  

        They don't care         
       about me anymore.        

           Oh, yeah.            

   That's a load of rubbish.    

   They don't care about you.   

       Right, here we go.       

              No.               

           It's okay.           

             Good.              

       Right. No problem.       

     What's that all about?     

     It's Yoko's ephemeris.     

You know, I don't know          
much about it, really.          

It's more Yoko's thing.         

  I do know it works, though.   

      I mean, we couldn't       
   have had Sean without it.    

Did you know that Sean was born 

 on exactly the same day as me, 
        October the 9th?        

       Yeah, I knew that.       

 What were you doing just now?  

                What were you   
                looking up?     

  Uh, I was making sure that    
  Mercury isn't in retrograde   

     you know what I mean?      

  That's one of the few things  
        I do know about.        

     Mercury in retrograde      
        spells trouble.         

           Look out.            

       You're better off        
      just staying in bed.      

            And it's okay now?  

    There's no great danger     
      in us going outside?      

As far as I can tell, you know. 

     I mean, I could throw      
          the<i> I Ching</i>           

    to be on the safe side,     
           you know.            

            See what it says.   

    This is starting to get     

a bit complicated,              
isn't it?                       

          Not really.           

 I mean, you know, it's easier  

 than making up your own mind.  

     All the same, though,      
  I do think we ought to wear   

    some kind of disguises,     
           you know.            

      The two of us being       
      out there together.       

It's like we're asking          
for trouble.                    

I've got a whole closetful      
of disguises.                   

                    Have you?   

Yeah.

            I'll take my farm   
            in Scotland any day.

        It's peaceful, quiet,

Here now, Paul.

            And I tried giving  
            you the look.       

                Then you started
                with the...

                    Yeah, right.

        Like the harmless cop   

            who drove his       
            harmless little car 

        over me harmless mum.   

        He was pretty harmless  
        as well, wasn't he?     

        They're all bastards.   

Oh, come on, John.              

You're living                   
in the past.                    

One cop in Liverpool            
20 years ago                    

        has got nothing to do   
        with those two just now.

Look, cops is cops.             

New York or Liverpool.          

        You're just exploiting  
        them as scapegoats      

    for all your repressed      
    and pent-up anger... son.   

        Piss off.               

            You know I'm right. 

                    Come on.    

Have you given any thought      
to this trepanning thing?       

                    What is it? 

    Trepanning.                 

I'm thinking                    
of getting it done.             

            Never heard of it.  

Well, do you think              
you'd want to do it?            

            Well, what<i> is</i> it?   

Well, technically,              
what they do                    

            is they take this   
            cylindrical saw     

        and they position it    
        on the top of your skull

            and they, sort of,  
            drill this hole     

            which is very small 

    and it's supposed to relieve
    the pressure on your brain. 

        'Cause the theory is--  

    Get away.                   

            No, look, I know    
            this guy-- a doctor.

        He knows how to do it.  

        The theory is that our  
        skulls are too tight    

                and create too  
                much pressure   

            and that's why we're
            all so uptight.     

                    I mean, this
                    is something

                that the ancient
                Egyptians used  
                to do, you know.

Okay. All right.                

                They've dug up  
                these mummies   

            and there's actual  
            evidence of this    
            trepanning.         

    Mmm.                        

                The Indians     
                did it, as well.

            In Peru, I think.   

            They used to believe

            that all the evil   
            spirits could       
            be released         

            through this little 
            hole in your head.  

You're not seriously thinking   
of having this done?            

                    Yeah, I am. 

                    That's what 
                    I'm saying. 

            You ought to have   
            it done, too.       

            It's only a minor   
            surgical procedure. 

        Mmm.                    

        Look, you bring Linda,  
        I'll bring Yoko.        

        We'll all go together,  
        make it an outing.      

Listen, you go                  

then come back                  
and tell me how it is.          

If it works, great.             

I'll bring Linda                

                and we'll all   
                have a go at it.

                    (<i> laughing</i> )

        Just one thing, though. 

What do you do                  
when it rains?                  

    You hungry?                 

Starving!                       

         (<i> horn honks</i> )         

We'll be all right here.        
I'm a regular.                  

                Hmm... I'll take
                me tache off.   

       (<i> groans in pain</i> )       

              Ow!               

        Luigi.                  

           Hey, John.           
            Welcome.            

          (<i> kissing</i> )           

          Have a seat.          

    See, your, uh,              
    table is empty.             

                Thank you.      

                How's business, 
                Luigi?          

Ah, I can't complain.           

                Yeah?           

How about a couple              
of cappuccinos                  
to start with?                  

   Oh, all right by me, yeah.   
             Yeah?              

                    Yeah.       

Patty, cappuccino--<i> due.</i>        

        This is an old friend   
        of mine, Ramon.         

                How do you do?  

It's a pleasure                 
to meet you.                    

                    Pleasure    
                    to meet<i> you.</i>

    Um, I want to wash up...    
           my hands.            

    It's through that door,     
          on the left.          

                Thank you.      

   So, what else can I bring    
     for you this evening?      

   Uh, have you got any more    
 of that dark Italian chocolate 

      from the other day?       

Of course.                      

    I'll have some of that.     

Very good.                      

Relax,                          
I'll be back.                   

          (<i> sighing</i> )           

                    Who's that? 

                        Me?     

            Hmm, pretty good.   

                    This is not 
                    a bad place.

                Very European.  

        How's the little boy?   

  Oh, he's great, Luigi, yeah.  

     He's off with his mum      
 trying to find a suitable cow. 

         (<i> laughing</i> ):          
              Cow?              

                You make sure   

that you give my regards        
to your wife, eh?               

         I will, yeah.          

   And be sure and give mine    
     to your missus, yeah?      

I will.                         
            All right.          

Enjoy.                          

           All right.           

Take this, brother.             

May it serve you well.          

 This is some macrobiotic diet  
           you're on.           

Yeah, well...                   

we're all hypocrites            
at heart, aren't we?            

              Mmm!              

             What?              

I'm just waiting for him        

to get up his nerve.            

It's only a matter of time now. 

I can see it coming, you know?  

              Mmm.              

 From the minute we walked in.  

So, you nervous?                

         (<i> chuckling</i> ):         
             What?              

Playing in America again        
after all these years.          

           Oh, yeah.            

 Well, you know, there's always 
   the hurdle of nervousness    

  but I've had great responses  
          everywhere.           

       Even the press...        

   seems to like me for once.   

 What?! They liked              
<i> Band on the Run.</i>               

           Oh, yeah.            
        They did, yeah.         

      They liked that<i> one.</i>      

        <i> Band on the Run</i>        
       was a great album.       

           Excuse me?           

            Serious?            

       (<i> clears throat</i> )        

         I<i> am</i> serious.          

              Yes.              

    Well, maybe not serious,    
      but... I'm sincere.       

            Thanks.             

     Thank you! Thank you!      

    And for my next song...     

  yeah, I like that one a lot.  

              Mmm.              

I mean...                       

   it's not as though I think   

    you're complete rubbish,    
           you know.            

            Mm-hmm.             

 Of course, I like some things  

   better than others, but...   

        overall, I'd say        
 you're very good at being you. 

          Aha. Right.           

   Bring it on, bring it on.    

 I was waiting for the attack.  
             Go on.             

    No, no.                     

I'm not setting you up.         

                        You are.

Not as far as I know,           
at least.                       

       Excuse me, please.       

                    Excuse me...

   I don't want to bother you   
      or anything, but...       

         Well, you are.         

             Yeah.              

But, uh, you know               

   I just wanted to tell you    

       that you've been,        
     like, a big hero to me     

        for a long time         

and I just wanted               
to thank you.                   

Well, thanks very much          
and I hope you get over it.     

It's not...                     
it's not a hero so much.        

   It's more like, you know,    
      you saved me from...      

Look, don't go nailing me       
to your cross, all right?       

             Yeah.              

Can I just ask you              
one thing?                      

         (<i> chuckling</i> )          

        What?                   

   Okay, like, you've always    
    been my favorite Beatle     

right?                          

And... and I was                
just wondering                  

if there's any truth            
at all, you know                

   to... to all these rumors    

         about you guys         
     getting back together?     

    Not a chance.               

            Really?             

Why would you want that?        

       Well, I just think       
        that it would...        

 Aren't I your favorite Beatle? 

             Yeah.              

        What do we need         
   the others for, then, eh?    

    Aren't I enough for you?    

        Sure, but you're        
  not doing anything anymore.   

 I... I mean to say, didn't...  

       didn't you retire?       

Who told you that?              

    I heard it on the radio.    

Ah, well, there you are, see?   

You can't believe anything      
you hear on the radio.          

        Do you know what        
        I heard on the radio?   

No.                             

        I heard...              

that Paul McCartney             
and Wings                       

have the number one song        
in America.                     

             Right.             
      "Silly Love Songs."       

Yeah, well, what do you         
think of that?                  

Do you agree                    
with that?                      

Well, it's not really up to me. 

What are you talking about?     
Course it is.                   

You have an opinion,            
don't you?                      

      Well... mmm... yeah.      

        "Yeah"?                 

Do you have an opinion?         

                        You do. 
    Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.         

Well, let's hear it.            

Okay, well...                   

Do you think                    
that "Silly Love Songs"         

by Paul McCartney               
and Wings                       

is the number one song          
in America?                     

        Well, if you...         

  if you mean, do<i> I</i> like it...  

     then I'd say, yeah...      

sure, you know...               

it's all right.                 

I guess it's...                 

     Okay, I think he could     
        do a lot better.        

              Huh.              

So, uh, you wouldn't            
personally regard it            

as the number one song          
in America?                     

No, I wouldn't                  
call it that.                   

But, you know,                  
obviously                       

enough people                   
are buying it                   

and requesting it               
at the radio station            

    and that to, you know...    

to make it                      
number one.                     

      Mmm, well, let that       
      be a lesson to you.       

             Yeah.              

             What?              

  Your opinion's worth shite.   

     I'm sorry, I didn't...     

I didn't mean...                

No, don't say sorry.            

You know, I'm just playing      
with you, all right?            

            You know, you didn't
            do anything wrong.  

             Right.             

Look...                         

you know, just go out,          
have a good night.              

Tell your girlfriend--          
you have a girlfriend, yeah?    

            Sort of.            

Well, you tell                  
your "sort of" girlfriend       

that you "sort of" met          
one of the Beatles              

and he turned out to be         
just as much of a bastard       

    as anybody else.            

          Maybe more.           

And don't be so hard            
on yourself, all right?         

           O... okay.           

        Dismissed.              

            Thanks.             

(<i> chuckling</i> ):                  
You're welcome.                 

              Bye.              

                        Uh, bye.
            Bye-bye.            

    Bye-bye. Cheerio.           

  Lennon: one, McCartney: nil.  

    More chocolate,             
    that's what we need.        

LENNON:                         
It's the bleedin'               
drama that irks me.             

The indecisiveness.             

I mean, make your move          
and get on with it.             

            Why don't you       
            just ignore them?   

I guarantee you,                
when he finally                 

gets the nerve                  
to come over                    

he won't                        
own up to it.                   

It's going to be,               
"My Connie adores you"          

or, "My Pamela                  
thinks you're fabulous."        

                    My Heather  
                    likes you.  

That, too, yeah.                

     No, I mean<i> my</i> Heather.     

  She thinks you're all right.  

                No accounting   
                for taste       

        but she's actually got  
        a bit of a crush on you.

What, Linda's girl?             

  Well, she's my Heather, too.  

     I legally adopted her      
        a long time ago.        

        How old is she?         

          She's... 13.          

        Can you believe I've got
        a teenage daughter, huh?

                        Yeah.   

                    Here she is.

                That was taken  
                at the farm.    

            That's her favorite 
            lamb there with her.

This here a lamb?               

                        Mm.     

Did you serve                   
it up for supper?               

        No, we're vegetarians.  

            Did you know that?  

                Yeah. We make   
                it a point      

        not to eat anything     
        that has a face on it.  

       Well, that's Mary.       

      She's the bold one.       

     Does Mary have a lamb?     

It's just a little one, though. 

      Uh-oh. Heartbreaker.      

                    Let me see. 

        Oh, yes. That's Stella. 

She's adorable.                 

                        Yeah.   

And she's only four and a half. 

         She's already          
      dead keen on horses.      

   You're a lucky man, Paul.    

     Got a whole stableful      
        of healthy kids.        

             Yeah.              

         We're thinking         
    of having maybe one more    

      after the tour ends       

       which is in, uh...       

         oh, another...         

          six months?           

          I don't know          
     how you do it, Macca.      

    I mean, let alone, why.     

    Going on the road again     
       like the old days        

       is the last thing        
    on earth<i> I'd</i> want to do.    

                    Yeah, but   
                    see, for me 

    it's just the opposite.     

    See, Linda and the kids     
  are with me, which is great   

          and the work          
  is what's keeping me going.   

        I could never do        
     what you're doing now.     

                Doing nothing.  

                    I mean...   

        not making music        

        or, or whatever.        

       Well, actually...        

   actually, that's not true.   

        When we split up        

      and I was suddenly        
      out of a job, uh...       

                that's exactly  
                what I did do-- 

                        nothing.

Hmm.                            

I was at the farm and           
at first I stopped washing.     

Then I stopped shaving.         

And then I just stopped         
getting out of bed.             

I just used                     
to lay in bed                   

for days on end                 

and smoking                     
and drinking                    

and watching                    
the telly.                      

It was really awful.            

            It's hard facing    
            yourself, isn't it? 

       (<i> chair scrapes</i> )        

The time                        
has come at last.               

                    Excuse me.  

I-I couldn't                    
help noticing...                

    Yeah, I've been noticing    
         you noticing.          

            Oh, yes. I'm afraid 
            we haven't been     

    terribly discreet, you see. 

This must be your lovely wife.  

                Hmm? Oh, yes.   

How do you do?                  

            Charmed, I'm sure.  

                Yes, well, as   
                I was saying    

                we-we couldn't  
                help noticing   

that we happen                  
to be sitting                   

in very close proximity         
to one of the Beatles           

and I was wondering...          

    that is, if it wouldn't be  
    too great an imposition     

if I might persuade you         
to sing a few bars              

of "Yesterday"                  
for my wife?                    

        She's a, she's a very   
        big fan, you know.      

     I'd be quite happy to      

and perhaps, while I'm crooning 

  you'd put on your wife's wig  

       get on your knees        
      and lick my lingam?       

            You should be       
            ashamed of yourself.

          I am, yeah.           

                    Come on.    

    His poor wife.              

                Do you know     
                how many times  

                people have     
                come up to me   

        and said that they      
        just love the Beatles   

        and that their all-time 
        favorite Beatles song   

                just happens to 
                be "Yesterday"? 

            I ought to wear a   
            bleedin' placard    
            around me neck      

            saying, "It's a Paul
            song. Piss off."    

Yeah, he should                 
have asked you to sing          

"Strawberry Fields"             
or "Imagine."                   

                Damn right.     

        Oh, yeah.               

        I've always hated you   

                for writing that
                bleedin' song.  

You bloody well wish            
you'd written it.               

            I could have written
            it better than you. 

    Oh, yeah, like              
    you never tried.            

Anyway, you would               
have bollixed it up             

by having somebody              
screaming over the refrain.     

        Oh, quit being so smug. 

    Want one?                   

        Yeah. It goes without   
        saying, doesn't it?     

            Oh, my.             

          If it isn't           
          John Lennon.          

                        Yeah.   

              Man,              
       I love your work.        

            I think             
     you are just fabulous.     

                        Really? 

            This is             
        such a pleasure.        

                Thanks, very    
                much. Thank you.

         Oh, no, it is.         

        Paul McCartney?         

          Oh, my God.           

         I used to have         
          your picture          

       on my bedroom wall       
     when I was a teenager.     

                Beatlemania     
                strikes again.  

            Man, you            
         are gorgeous.          

       Oh, come on, Paul.       

Geez. See ya!                   

              Bye.              

            LENNON:             
       <i> The chicks always</i>       
       <i> liked you better.</i>       

            Fancy going up on   
            the roof for a bit? 

Yeah, all right.                

         Hello, Morty.          

            Good evening, sir.  

                How are you?    

                        Good.   

Leave them outside              
the door, will you?             

                Very good, sir. 

Oh, you can take mine.          

Thank you.                      

        Room service.           

    Here.                       

       (<i> inhales deeply</i> )       

                    (<i> chuckles</i> )

Where we                        
going, Johnny?                  

                Straight to     
                the top, boys.  

Oh, yeah?                       
Where is that?                  

            The topper-most     
            of the popper-most. 

                Really slow     
                lift, isn't it? 

    Yeah.                       

    Cut it out.                 

                What? I didn't  
                do nothing.     

    Hey!                        

            Didn't do nothing.  

I'll cripple you.               

I'll cripple you.               

Cut it out.                     

        Get off!                

        God.                    

Just 'cause Yoko's away         
doesn't mean                    

you have to stop                
brushing your teeth.            

                    Aw...       

            You know you want   
            it, you tart.       

Is my name Brian?               

I got you, son.                 

    Piss off.                   

                    That's it.  
                    That's it.  

        That's enough of that.  
        That's enough of that.  

So, uh, how's Leeds?            

            Leeds played away.  

                    Top of the  
                    division.   

                Top of the      
                division, yeah. 

Yeah, man united,               
man united doing well.          

                Oh, very well,  
                very well, yeah.

Yeah, yeah.                     

                Coming down     
                the pub with us?

                    Yeah?       

                Fancy a pint?   

    It's smaller than I         
    thought it would be.        

    ¶ Hello! ¶                  

Whose place is this?            

     Remember the last time     
we stood on a rooftop together? 

I'd like to thank you on behalf 
  of the group and ourselves.   

 I hope we passed the audition. 

And so it was to be             
the last time                   

      our beloved Beatles       
      would ever perform        

      together in public.       

                The famous Apple
                rooftop session.

                Hey, this place 
                is huge. Look.  

I really enjoyed that.          

                Somewhere to    
                put the cows.   

So what was the last            
song we ever played             
together then?                  

          "Get Back."           

      That's right, yeah.       

           "Get Back            
  to Where You Once Belonged."  

Got a smoke?                    

        Oh, it's me last one.   

That's all right,               
I don't mind.                   

        I'll share it with you. 

Remember we were hoping         
that the cops would             
actually arrest us              

and carry us off                
while we were playing.          

   Yeah, in the Black Maria.    

                    (<i> sighs</i> )   

Do you ever feel like           

when you really get             
to the heart of it              

that it's all                   
just an illusion?               

  You know, the Buddhists say   

that you've got to rid yourself 
     of all these illusions     

  including the ultimate one,   
 which is this concept of self. 

Do you know                     
how basic that is?              

  All this pain is wrapped up   
        in this concept         

        that this thing         
       called "I" exists.       

And that                        
the real key                    

is in perceiving this...        
quiet reality                   

that's... so much simpler       
than anything we can imagine.   

   Mmm. Of course, you know,    
         my problem is          

 the moment that I get a taste  
of this quiet reality, you know 

my ego gets                     
all excited                     

'cause I think I'm              
onto something big here.        

 The next great understanding,  
           John. Hey!           

 Before I know it, my thoughts  
   are running the show again   

 and I'm back conceptualizing,  
             and...             

I've got to learn               
how to stop meself earlier.     

You know, I've got to learn     
how to control me thoughts.     

            You got to learn how
            to share that smoke.

      Why does everything       
  have to be such a struggle?   

    That's a good question.     

  Then again, it's irrelevant.  

    What?                       

Do I contradict meself?         

                    Frequently. 

Walt Whitman.                   

                Walt Whitman?   

    Yeah.                       

    Do I contradict myself?     

        Very well, then,        
      I contradict myself.      

          "I am large.          
     I contain multitudes."     

 So you've taken to memorizing  
 the works of the great poets   

      have you now, John?       

Touche, Paul.                   

Just trying to recognize        
the possibilities, Paul.        

    I remember the last time    

                    I saw you   
                    out in L.A. 

        during your so-called   
        "lost weekend" years.   

        You remember? When you  
        and Yoko were separated.

    No.                         

        We ran in to each other 
        at Harry Nilsson's.     

                        Come on.

                We jammed with  
                Stevie Wonder   
                and all them.   

        <i> We</i> did?                

          (<i> laughing</i> )          

    You were off your head.     

I was, yeah.                    

           Obviously.           

     Hmm... I've got, like,     
     fragments of memories.     

       It's really hazy.        

     Anyway, go on, though.     

     Well, anyway, somebody     
    offered me some P.C.P.--    

                Angel dust-- and
                it was kind of a
                new thing then  

    so I said, "What is it?"    

      He said, "It's, uh,       
it's elephant tranquilizer, man.

      It's, like, primo."       

            I said, "Oh, yeah?  

      Have you tried it?"       

   And he says, "Yeah, yeah."   

  I said, "Oh, yeah. Is it...   
          is it fun?"           

         He says, "No."         

                And he's still  
                doing it.       

    I mean, my question is--    
still is-- if it's not fun, why?

        There's enough problems 
        as it is, you know.     

         I just wonder          
     how much of this pain      

            you keep bringing   
            up is maybe--       

 I may be wrong-- in your head. 

        Because if it was a     
        real thing, a real fear 

   I think you could face it    
        and get past it         

 and not let it run your life.  

         Are you saying         
that my thoughts cause me pain? 

             Yeah.              

Well, that's what               
I'm trying to say.              

            Yeah, but you're    
            still in your head  

                even when you   
                talk about      

                thinking about  
                not thinking.   

    Me?                         

                    Yeah.       

            You're just         
            afraid to let go,   
            like all of us      

                to stop being   
                in control.     

Yeah, so, I get in me own way   
to protect meself.              

    Yeah, but it's not always   
    dangerous, you know.        

Like right now... this moment.  

        You're relatively safe. 

        I'm not going to do     
        anything to hurt you.   

    I'm not going to leave you. 

                All right?      

All right, Paul, you want       
to play that game, do you?      

Take a good look.               

Tell me what you see.           

I see a beautiful little boy    
whose mother says good-bye.     

                I see the       
                same little boy 

        blaming himself         
   for his father's mistakes    

                telling himself 
                that everything 
                is his fault.   

     I see this little boy      

    believing that the world    
      is a dangerous place      

    and that there's nobody     

       you can depend on        
        to protect you.         

            So you grow up      
            trying to pretend   

                that ordinary   
                little things   

don't scare the hell out of you,
          but they do.          

                        I see...

                my old friend   

    who used to skip classes    

     and wander off with me     
      to the old graveyard      

        looking back at me now  
        still putting himself   

      and me through hell.      

   And I see a frightened man   

      who doesn't realize       

            how beautiful he is.

    I'm sorry.                  

           For what?            

For being such a tosser.        

                Me, too, John.  

                Me, too.        

    You only get married once;  
    at least, I hope so.        

            Now, the first time 
            I was here...       

            I think I asked     
            for a center vent.  

        I don't really see it.  

     (<i> samurai screaming</i> )      

                    Very nice.  

                Anyway, enough  
                partying.       

        I found the right girl, 
        and I'm all set.        

        I couldn't be happier.  

        The suit is wonderful.  

        There's just one thing  
        that would make me      

        a little bit happier.   

            About the pants...  

                there's no fly. 

      (<i> audience laughs</i> )       

            I mean, this is     
            my wedding night.   

    (<i> mumbling incoherently</i> )   

     (<i> samurai screaming</i> )      

           DON PARDO:           
     Tune in next week for      
       another episode of       

        <i> Samurai Tailor.</i>        

    Hi. I'm Lorne Michaels,     
the producer of<i> Saturday Night.</i> 

 Right now we're being seen by  
approximately 22 million viewers

 but please allow me, if I may  

       to address myself        
  to four very special people.  

 John, Paul, George and Ringo-- 
          the Beatles.          

Hey. Wake up.                   
                Wha...? Wha...? 

    Lately, there have been     
 a lot of rumors to the effect  

He's talking to us.             
                Yeah?           

      that the four of you      
might be getting back together. 

      That would be great.      
                Not a chance.   

  In my book, the Beatles are   

         the best thing         
  that ever happened to music.  

         JOHN AND PAUL:         
      What is he on about?      

 It goes even deeper than that. 

You're not just a musical group,
      you're a part of us.      

      We grew up with you.      

He's off his rocker,            
he is.                          

    And it's for this reason    

     that I'm inviting you      
     to come on our show.       

     (<i> audience laughing</i> )      

 Now we've heard and read a lot 
       about personality        

 and legal conflicts that might 
prevent you guys from reuniting.

What is he talking about?       
                        What?   

 That's something which is none 
        of my business.         

            What? Personality   
            conflicts?          
Misinformed.                    

            You guys            
   will have to handle that.    

  But it's also been said that  

 no one has yet to come up with 
  enough money to satisfy you.  

    Yeah.                       

 Well, if it's money you want,  
    there's no problem here.    

   The National Broadcasting    
   Company has authorized me    

 to offer you a certified check 

          for $3,000.           

     (<i> audience laughing</i> )      

          Here it is.           

 Can we get a close-up of this, 
             Dave?              

     Which camera is it on?     

(<i> laughing</i> ):                   
$3,000!                         

         Zoom in there.         

That's a good one!              

        Now here it is,         
       as you can see...        

"The Beatles"!                  

 It is a check made out to you, 
          the Beatles           

          for $3,000.           

          (<i> laughter</i> )          

       All you have to do       
  is sing three Beatle tunes.   

        "She Loves You,         
       Yeah, Yeah, Yeah."       

   That's $1,000 right there.   

                What if we don't
                want to sing    
                "She Loves You"?

      You know the words;       
         it'll be easy.         

Like I said, this is made out...

             BOTH:              
    ¶ Yeah... yeah... yeah ¶    

  this check here is made out   
        to the Beatles.         

You divide it any way you want. 

If you want to give Ringo less, 
       that's up to you.        

            Oh, that's brutal,  
            that it!            

Oh, that's dead mean.           

  I'd rather not get involved.  

We love Ringo.                  

    I'm sincere about this.     

        If it helps you         
 to reach a decision to reunite 

          well, then,           
   it's worth the investment.   

                "It's a worthy  
                investment"!    
That's live.                    

        You have agents.        

You know where I can be reached.

   Just think about it, okay?   

           Thank you.           

    (<i> audience applauding</i> )     

          Let's do it.          

             What?              

 It'll blow everybody's minds.  

      It certainly would.       

         Come on, then.         
    What are we waiting for?    

      Wait. This is live?       

                        Yeah.   

     "Live from New York,       
     it's<i> Saturday Night."</i>      

      You know, it's just       
        down the block.         

                We could make   
                it easily.      

          Are you mad?          

         Yeah. Come on.         

   Did you bring your guitar?   

             Yeah.              

                Well, go get it.

    We'll work through a few    
    numbers, you know. Come on. 

But-but... it's...              

it's in the car.                

           Call down            
   and have them bring it up.   

                We'll go through
                a few tunes.    

        Go down to the studio.  

         I'll get mine          
      out of the bedroom.       

Oh, I don't know                

           you know?            

              Why?              

Well, we haven't played together
            in ages.            

 What's that got to do with it? 

            Come on.            
      It's like screwing.       

            You know-- once you 
            know how to do it...

                        come on.

       Look, you do your        
     Jerry Lee Lewis number     

                    and we'll do
                    the Everly  
                    Brothers one

      as well, all right.       

             What?              

      What if we're crap?       

                Are you serious?

             I am.              

  This is only what the whole   
   world's been waiting for.    

Come on, go get your six-string.

         It'll be fun.          

  You really want to do this?   

             Yeah.              

 All right. Well, will we get   
 there before the show's over?  

         I don't know.          
     We'll take it one step     

                    at a time,  
                    all right?  
           All right.           

           All right?           
Right.                          

Hey, you're coming back.        

                    Yeah.       

    Good.                       

    (<i> poorly tuned chords</i> )     

     Ooh, bollocks, right.      

  I'll get Paul to tune that.   

    (<i> knocking</i> ):               
    Henry!                      

You open the boot?              

                Have a nice kip.

    Be back in a few minutes.   

        (<i> phone rings</i> )         

             Hello?             

             Yoko.              

        Where you been?         

            Well...             

           Tomorrow.            

     Yeah, yeah. All right.     

Mm-hmm. Yeah.                   

     I wish you were here.      

           No, I wish           
   you were physically here.    

You're the only thing that keeps
me from disappearing, you know? 

          I got to go.          

    Unfortunately, so do I.     

     Well, when, you know?      

     I mean, it's late now.     

             PAUL:              
    Linda, can you hear me?     

        I'm in the car.         

 Yeah, listen, so you'll never  
    guess who I went to see.    

             Yeah.              

          Right. Yeah.          

Listen... yeah... I'll be there 
        in ten minutes.         

  I'll tell you all about it.   

      It was unbelievable.      

         No, no. Good.          

             Yeah.              

             Okay?              

             Right.             

             Yeah.              

         I'll see you.          

       Oh, and, Linda...        

          I love you.
