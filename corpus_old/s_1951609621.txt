# <i>You are an obsession.</i>
<i>I cannot sleep.</i> #

# <i>I am your possession.</i>
<i>Unopened at your feet.</i> #

# <i>There's no balance,</i>

# <i>Be still, I will not</i>

# <i>I will have you,</i>
<i>Yes I will have you.</i> #

# <i>I will find a way</i>

# <i>Like a butterfly,</i>
<i>a wild butterfly.</i> #

# <i>I will collect you</i>

I don't think
this is goth night.

This place sucks!

Indeed!

# <i>Who do you want me to be</i>
<i>to make you sleep with me?</i> #

I'm going
to the bathroom.

There's an idea for a
poem I want to write!

# <i>Who do you want me to be</i>
<i>to make you sleep with me?</i> #

Hey!
Watch it, fat ass!

#<i>I need you, I need you,</i>
<i>by sun or candlelight</i>

# <i>You protest.</i>
<i>You want to leave</i> #

# <i>Stay.</i>
<i>There's no alternative</i> #

# <i>Your face appears again.</i>
<i>I see your beauty there</i> #

# <i>But I see danger,</i>

# <i>A circumstance</i>

# <i>Your affection is</i>

# <i>You are an obsession.</i>
<i>You're my obsession.</i> #

# <i>You are an obsession.</i>
<i>You're my obsession.</i> #

# <i>What do you want me to be</i>
<i>to make you sleep with me?</i> #

I want to leave,
I don't belong here.

It's fun cause we're together.

No it's not!

What's with that solid gold
dancer with his ass in the air?

The dazzle dancer?

Yeah, why don't you
guys get married!

<i>I don't even</i>
<i>know if he's gay.</i>

<i>He's got like frosted hair.</i>

George Michael has frosted hair
and he's like totally straight.

Adam, you're 21,
you're like almost 30.

You need to more aggressive.

What do I say?

Just be yourself.

What's that?

Tell him you liked his dancing.

<i>Oh my God, yeah, that F.I.T.</i>
<i>Fag in training was there...</i>

<i>and of course Keith was there.</i>

<i>Let Carrie tell the story, she</i>
<i>tells it so much better than you.</i>

I'm standing there talking
to Keith Herring and this guy...

starts comparing him to Warhol.

It was so embarrassing.

He hates those
comparisons, you know.

<i>God, it's so tragic.</i>

Well I guess Bela Lugosi
ain't dead after all.

He is dead, people
like you killed him.

Oh, chill out.

Oh.
How did it go?

Oh God, I'm such a loser.

You are not, would I be
friends with a loser?

Hey!

Sorry about my
friend Carrie.

I'm Maura Bid and
this is Rex Havoc.

Cool look, Rex.

Yeah, my last
boyfriend was a goth,

are all of you as wild
and nasty as he was?

The night decrees its own
appreciations for some mortals...

treading the river Styx.

So you don't like to dance?

Not to this music.

Yeah, well it is Danceateria.

Yeah, more like Danceaqueeria.

What is that,
is that like a rib?

Yeah, you want one?

Na, na, I don't have much of an
appetite if you catch my drift.

Hey, you all want a bump?

The bump?

We're goths, we don't
dance, we're dead.

No, no, a bump of coke.

Drugs?

<i>Look at me, look at me.</i>

Whew!
Whoa!

I am so sorry.

It's alright, at least it's
not the same one as last time.

Hey, Rex.

Oh my God,

he totally looks like the
guy from the Ah-Ha video!

Well, he can
'Take On Me' anytime.

Do you think he
still has some cocaine?

Oh my God, you're like totally
addicted after like one bump!

No, I'm not.

It was fun, it wasn't like
I thought it would be.

Well it gave me the
total Hershey squirts.

I hear they cut it
with baby laxatives.

Well, you said you wanted
to lose some weight.

Hi.

Hey, you okay?

Yeah, just my wrist.

Where do you live?

Brooklyn.

Me too, me too.

Sun's coming up,
you want to watch it...

from the
Brooklyn Bridge?

Well I can't just
leave my friend Rhonda.

Good night.

Good luck.
Stop it!

So?

Okay.

All right.

Yeah, I go to A.M.D.A., you
know that theatre school uptown.

We're doing
The Sound of Music,

I'm up for the
part of the Captain.

# <i>Perhaps I had a</i>
<i>wicked childhood.</i> #

Wow.

# <i>Perhaps I had a</i>
<i>miserable youth...</i> #

Someday I'm going
to dance on Broadway.

Watch this...

Ew!

Well, don't give up you've
obviously got a huge talent.

Whew!

Oh my God, just kidding.

Give it here.

Hey, you know
somehow I feel like...

I've known you my whole life.

Really, it's not just the drugs?

Oh no, this is way
bigger than drugs.

Oh my God, I know.

<i>When I saw you</i>
<i>dancing up there,</i>

I knew you were the one.

I knew I was the one too.

Where have you
been my whole life?

I've been looking for you.

Here I am.

This is so fun.

I love you.

I love you too.

What's your name again?

Watch this.

Wow!

<i>Oh good, more cocaine.</i>

You have such an awesome body,
do you like exercise and stuff?

Yeah, I think I'm
the only gay guy...

in the whole world
that works out.

Hey, what's that
muscle called on your arm?

Huh?

Here?

Tricep.

What about those, those ones.

Pecs.

Yeah, like that?

Lats...

Abs, quads, gluts...

Oh my God I'm like the
luckiest guy in the

whole world right now.

You are so f'ing hot.

Bicep.

Whoa...

Puppy don't look.

# <i>You are an obsession.</i>

Sorry, sorry.

# <i>Yes I will have you.</i> #

# <i>I will find a way</i>

Hey.

I thought you left.

Oh, no I just came up
for some fresh air.

But if you can't beat
them join them right?

Can I have a hit of that?

Isn't this retro music awesome?

It reminds me of slumber
parties in grade school.

Wow!

Somebody needs a drink!

No, no, I'm straight, sober.

Really?

Wow.

I would hate to be
sober, that sucks ass.

I don't see why sober
people still get to smoke.

Nicotine is such a drug.

Yeah, but nicotine doesn't
make me wander through gay bars...

pinching my nipples and moaning,
"pick me, pick me" to hot guys.

Wow.

Sounds like you did a lot
of coke or crystal or crack.

And now you're an AA.

But you don't go to crack
meetings because they're too...

hard core and you're just a nice
Jewish boy at heart who can only...

let lose when he's fucked up.

You have a lot of guilt which
is why you need chemicals...

to squelch your conscious.

You realize you just said
all that out loud, right?

Oh, I'm studying acting
so I pick up on...

people's personalities,
you know?

Guys think they're
so mysterious,

but most are just
really transparent.

Well I appreciate the completely
superficial deconstruction...

of my character but
I think I'm a little more...

complex than you think.

Hi everybody.

My name is Mary and I used
to be a bipolar crack addict.

But now I'm just bipolar.

Yeah!

<i>Welcome, welcome, welcome</i>
<i>to the midnight...</i>

<i>whip that crack fellowship.</i>

This is a crack meeting,
tonight's topic is crack.

Okay.

Ah...

Happy birthday.

Yeah, hello!

Hey honey, just calling to wish
you know who a happy Bert-day.

Well I'd put him on the phone
but he's in a cake hole.

<i>I should be reported</i>
<i>to the Humane Society.</i>

<i>Oh please, I've eaten more</i>
<i>than that in one sitting.</i>

Remember my sister's wedding,
she's still mad

she didn't get a piece.

<i>Right.</i>

And besides one of the many
advantages of being a dog...

is that get to eat like a pig.

Hey, fatso, ready to go on?

Speaking of pigs, Lou just
propositioned me again.

Hey, hey everybody
having a good time?

Let me hear you say 'yeah'!

All right.

Oh, I'm hanging by a thread here
the audiences have been really...

tough and I'm sweating
like Whitney Houston...

going though customs.

<i>Uh...</i>

Maybe you might want to,
you know,

come up with some new material,

you know, since
you lost the weight.

What are you talking about?

# <i>Help me Rhonda, yeah,</i>
<i>get her out of my pants.</i> #

Thank you.

Oh shit, he's singing a song.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>
<i>Rhonda Gernon...</i>

and her fabulous fun bags.

Whew!

I know what
you're thinking.

Doesn't she have a pretty face?

And what a personality!

If only I didn't get my dresses
made by Omar the tent maker.

I'm so fat,
I eat with a forklift.

I'm so fat, when I
back up, my ass beeps.

<i>Fashioned from</i>
<i>actual ceramic chips...</i>

<i>recovered</i>
<i>at Ground Zero.</i>

<i>This commemorative plate will</i>

<i>Featuring an American bald</i>

<i>- In all her majestic glory</i>
Oh my God.

<i>With a gorgeous</i>
<i>single cubic zirconia tear...</i>

<i>running down her furrowed face.</i>

<i>Look at that, now...</i>

Oh!

Geez!

Somebody...

Help!

Help me!

Oh my God, somebody help me!

Sir, animals
are not allowed here,

hospital policy.

What do you mean
'hospital policy'?!

You are going to have to
keep your voice down sir.

Now there is a very good animal
hospital over on First Avenue.

I'm not on First Avenue, I'm
on Tenth Avenue and there are...

doctors here, medical equipment,
and he has a heart and brain...

and lungs just like
a normal person.

Sir, please come with me.

There was an accident,
I stabbed him.

I stabbed him accidentally.

Hello.

<i>We have another dog</i>
<i>stabber down here.</i>

Sir the hospitals doesn't admit
animals, we have told you.

This is not an animal,
this is my child.

I'm a single gay man in New
York, don't you understand?!

Rob, Rob, it's okay.
It's okay.

Sir, bring the
dog on back, okay.

Thank you.

At least there is
still one caring person...

left in the
medical establishment.

Sir.

<i>What is this</i>
<i>National Freak Day?</i>

<i>We've got a lady yelling</i>
<i>at her vagina out there.</i>

Ah, the pictures are back.

The dog has a bruised
rib which was...

I'm sorry I can't hear you.

Oh, sorry.

X-rays, yeah your dog has a
bruised rib which the knife...

must have grazed
while it entered.

See there's a little clouding
in the abdomen region which...

we'd expect in a puncture wound.

Is he bleeding internally?

Yeah, a little, but you know
nothing life threatening.

Oh thank you, thank you so much.

I can't thank you
enough for helping us.

Quite all right.

You want to go see him now?

Yeah.
Right this way.

Hi, oh...

You know I have to say that
his fat protected him...

from the knife,
although in the long run...

you might want
to put him on a diet.

Oh, yeah, I don't
know why he's so fat.

I'm Adam, by the way.
Oh, I'm Doctor Hicks, Steven.

Are you a veterinarian?

Actually I'm a shrink,
I do outpatient...

mental health services here.

I went to medical school, I
was going to be a veterinarian,

I actually love animals.

Why didn't you?

I couldn't stand the idea of
dealing with neurotic...

pet owners on a daily basis.

Oh, sorry.

It's okay.

It is sad how people attribute
human qualities to animals...

instead of just eating their
flesh or wearing their fur.

So Adam, let's
talk about you now.

Me?

You want to tell me what
drove you to stab your dog?

Oh, it was an accident.

Look I love this dog
more than I love myself.

I know it sounds dumb,
but I'm not crazy.

I know you're not crazy.

You know actually it's
refreshing to meet somebody who

loves someone or
something that much.

Oh.

Hey, greetings
gay doctor roommate!

Tough day at the 'orifice'?

A woman who thinks God
speaks through her vagina.

Oh, wait, Polly?

Oh no...

no please.

Blond, thirties, five-eight.

You had sex with
a homeless woman?

It was kind
of sweet actually,

it's not the way
you make it sound.

For God's sake.

We actually cuddled a lot,
it was very intimate.

Yeah, well she
was probably cold.

You know homeless
people have needs.

You know they need
love like other folks.

I helped her, I provided a
service for her actually,

you know for five minutes her
vagina stopped talking to her.

Michael I'm going to take
a shower for both of us.

Well, your mother would be
happy, marrying a doctor.

Is he Jewish?
I don't think so.

Whatever, I'll never see
him again unless I go insane.

Adam, we're like in our
thirties, we're almost 40,

you need to be more aggressive.

Why don't you go
back to the hospital?

No!
Why not?

He already thinks I'm
a crazy pet person.

You're the only person I know
that showers before the gym.

Well, I need to blow
off some steam.

Among other things.
Uh-huh, that's right.

God, you gay guys are so lucky.

You get to connect
and make love...

to someone
different every night.

Yeah.

If women were as promiscuous
as you there'd be like

orgies in the street.

Thanks to you there already are.

Oh no, I brought her back here.

Well, have fun having
gay, anonymous sex...

in the low self esteem room.

Thanks.

Hey, you're hot,
I wish I had your body,

but like with my face.

I wish you did too.

God, don't you just love this
gym it feels so good to sweat

out the tina, you
know what I mean?

Actually I don't, I don't use
drugs and neither should you.

Ew!

It sounds like somebody had
a bad experience with drugs.

Excuse me?

No, it's okay, I'm
just really observant.

I notice things that
other guys might not.

Is that so?

Yeah.

I'm going to be an
actor so I pick up...

on people's personalities.

You don't do drugs
because you have...

what they call...
'control issues'.

You're like totally afraid to be
out of control of your body...

or let someone see you in a
less than perfect light.

You're really afraid of
letting your hair down,

unless it has to
do with sex,

and then you can
completely cut lose and...

Hey!

Sorry, sorry.

Ew!

Dogs are so gross!

<i>How can someone love</i>
<i>something that shits...</i>

<i>right in front of them?</i>

Excuse me,

could you eat any of
these birds if you had to?

You know, like if terrorists
poisoned the food supply.

Oh look everyone, we have a duck
in flight directly above us.

Oh my God!
Quick, somebody call 911!

Long live the NRA!

I am so sorry, this
usually doesn't happen.

Hey, you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine,
I just bruised a rib.

Oh my God, it is you.
It's you the dog guy.

Hi.
Hey.

Wow.
What a coincidence.

How is your dog,
speaking of bruised ribs?

He's all better.

He pees on the floor
sometimes, or is that me?

So what do you do,

like bird watching
tours around here?

Yeah, you thought you were the
only one to deal with crazies.

That was actually
pretty heroic of you,

you know, tackling that guy,
getting all dirty.

Oh well, it was heroic
of you to save my dog...

and I don't mind
you getting dirty.

Oh, I know.

You know, I'm really sorry, I
was such a mess at the hospital.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Here, let me do something.

Wait a minute, come here.

It's all right,
just... here.

Here, look at me.

There, that's better.

So listen, I'm going to be an
aggressive type person here...

and, uh, take you out to
dinner some time.

Oh, you don't have to do that.

No, I want to.
Really, it's fine.

No, I want to.
Really, it's okay.

Really, I want to.
Really, it's fine.

But I want to.
It's all right.

I'd kind of like to.

Oh, I don't know, it's fine.

But I'd like to.

Really you should...

I know...
let me ask you out to dinner.

No, that's okay.

No, I'm serious I want to.

No, you don't have to.

But I want to.

I'm flattered but...

No, really come on I want to.

Listen, I should take you
out to dinner to thank you...

for what you
did for Burt.

Oh...

if it's just
about your dog, I mean,

you know, it's really
not necessary.

If you're asking me on a date,
like a romantic type thing,

you know then I would maybe
have to say yes to such...

an aggressive type person.

Well it just so happens to be
a romantic date type thing,

so yeah, that's right.

Okay.
Okay.

Okay, yeah good.

Um.

Wow.

How about tomorrow night?

Tomorrow night's great, where?

Uh...

how about right here in the
park, you know the bath house.

The Boat House?

Um, I know, Sona.
Sona on 6th at 6.

Yeah, okay, great.

Good.
All right.

Okay, well I'll see you there.

Okay.
Okay.

All right.
Bye.

Bye.

Bye.

Are you sure you
want to do this?

Will you chill out, you
sound like a jealous wife.

Well you know you're going
to have to change your whole

lifestyle, you know.

He's got a dog, you're going
to have to hide all the knives.

Michael, it's just a date, okay.

Look, I'm 36 years old,
maybe I'm tired of one hot...

sexual encounter after another.

Maybe I want to find out what
it's like to have okay sex...

with the same person
on a regular basis.

I'm very disappointed
in you, Steve.

Obviously you're not the
person that I thought you were.

Michael, I can still see you.

Okay, one apple
martini, diet coke.

You, uh,
you don't drink?

No, I'm on antibiotics.

Anything... communicable?

Oh, no, no, nothing
communicable.

No, it's been awhile since
I've communicated with anyone.

You mean since uh,
since you've had sex?

How long?

Oh, you know,
I don't know...

not that long,
like six months.

Wow.

Although I did meet this one guy
on the phone sex line who came over,

but he lied about what
he looked like, you know.

When he showed up
he was like 20 years older...

and 50 pounds heavier
than he said... and short.

Well he was a dwarf, or a
midget, I get them confused.

Yeah.

He had crossed eyes
and burns on his face.

No ears.

I think he might have
been born with a hair lip,

but that could have been
from the fire, you know.

Yeah.

I don't think he should have lied
about those things, you know?

No.

I told him that too
right after we had sex.

Thank you.

You know I have to tell you I
don't go on dates very often.

But you know ever since I saw
you at the E.R.,

you seem familiar
some how?

Hmm.

Did you grow up on Long Island?

Uh-uh.

Texas.
You don't have an accent.

Where did you go to college?

I went to NYU briefly
but it didn't work out.

I don't know, I guess it's
just one of those things, huh?

Oh, well I was in a porn
movie once, maybe you saw it.

Really?

No.

Okay.

Really?

No.

No, no.

No.

So you're an ornithologist?

No, I just watch
birds for a living.

Yeah, business can be
slow in the winter,

but it's a steady paycheck and
I'm trying to keep it simple...

right now.

Keep it simple?

Yeah.

Listen, I don't
have an infection.

I'm in recovery and part of
that is being honest about that.

Good for you, Adam.
Good for you.

Listen I deal
with a lot of people...

who have addictive
personalities.

Hey, wake up, it's not
over till the fat lady sings...

and I ain't sung yet.

Boy, tough crowd.

Remember ladies and gentlemen,
if you throw any...

wilted vegetables
I will simply eat them.

Although pork
ribs are my favorite,

feel free to throw those.

Isn't it funny how the
more ribs you eat...

the less you
can see of your own?

You know,
I know her, I think.

Are those chocolate covered
crickets I hear in the audience?

Yeah.
She was funny.

Well you're sweet to say
that but really she wasn't.

Ah, thanks for coming.

Yeah.

Ah, what a shitty
audience, right?

This is Steve.

Oh, the doctor with the heart
of gold, nice to meet you.

I know you, right, don't I?

Well, I was just on stage.

Wait a minute.

Oh my God.

Marie's...
Marie's Crisis.

You're the cocktail waitress...
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

I work there on weekends,
this place doesn't really pay,

so...

Right, I guess
you don't recognize me.

I'm too self absorbed
to notice other people.

I'm sorry did you say something?

Okay.

Excuse me I'm going
to take care of some business.

Okay.

He's so cute.

I know, I know he's
so cute and we've been...

having like the best time.

Like the more I talk to him the
more it's like I've known him...

my whole life.

Past lives.

Yeah.

You're about as funny
as a heart attack.

Oh, thanks dad!

Okay, well here I am.

Oh.

What!

Well aren't you worried about
getting gay bashed or yelled at?

No!

No, my God nothing like
that's ever happened to me.

Yeah, it's just like every time
I expressed affection in public...

some asshole from Jersey
throws a beer bottle at me.

Wow.

Sounds like you've
had really bad luck.

Oh... Burt, Burt,
Burt, look at you.

Give me five!
Hey!

Look at you, you're
all better now.

Oh!

Did you come?

No, I think your dog
is licking my foot.

Oh.

Burt, go to your bed, go!

I'm sorry.

I don't think he understands
what's happening to his daddy.

Do you understand what's
happening to his daddy?

No.

Yes, yeah.
Come here.

You know I actually wanted
to be a dancer at one point.

Really?

I was a theatre major,
couldn't deal with Bohemia,

such a messy lifestyle,
very, very messy.

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

When was your last relationship?

Um, by relationship what
exactly do you mean?

Your last boyfriend, lover,
homosexual lifetime...

commitment partner companion?

I've never really
had a long term one.

No one's really held my interest
for that long, you know?

Great.

No, wait a minute,
wait a minute, now.

You know when I was a kid
I figured I'd grow up,

meet a nice guy,
have a big wedding.

It all had to be a
certain way, you know.

Like in the movies I'd seen.

Yeah, me too.

You know, I'd always watch those
movies and I'd superimpose...

myself over the man
and then the woman,

you know,
I'd go back and forth.

Like in one scene I'd be Julia
Roberts and then in the next...

scene I'd be, you know
like Julia Roberts.

Really?

I'm Meg Ryan.

Hi Meg.

Yeah, you're blonde.

Ah, Julia come on.

Hey, you ever gone
gay two stepping over...

at the Big Apple Rodeo
in Midtown?

Two stepping, no I
can barely one step.

What do you wear to
something like that?

Oh my God, it's ho-down.

All right come
here, come here, come here.

I don't know how to do this.

Relax, okay, it's really easy.

All you do, okay look at this,
you go, quick quick step, step.

Quick, quick step,
step, exactly.

It's just a repetition of the
same move except we're...

going to be going that way,
all right?

Okay.
Ready, here we go.

And quick, quick step.
Good.

Quick, quick, exactly.

Ow!

I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry.

It's okay, sorry, let's
keep going all right?

I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

It's all right, look you'll
get the hang of it, all right.

Let's just keep
going, here we go.

Here we go, and
quick, quick step.

Good.

That's good.

Hey, Steve.

Hey, Andy.

This is uh... Adam.

Looks like someone's having
a little bit of trouble here.

Yeah, well I'm Jewish,
you know give me a bottle dance...

and I'm fine.

Well, I teach private lessons,
so if you ever want to take it...

seriously at all,
you just let me know.

Actually, Andy is a
really great instructor.

Not that you ever
needed any instructing.

Your dancing's not bad either.

Shalom cowboy...

Oh my God,
I'm terrible at this.

No, you just started, now
come on, try and relax.

All right, here we go.

Now, this is much better.

This is just like any slow song.

That's right, except in heels.

I tried to be a
good dancer once.

What happened?

Have you ever been
to a sober dance?

I hate to point this out
but dancing is 90% beer.

What about dirty dancing?

Wow, you're
in a mood.

You're like a different
person tonight.

Well, I'm happy.
I'm dating someone.

That guy Andy is really hot.

I guess.

But uh...
he's not my boyfriend.

You are.

# <i>Never did I know</i>
<i>I'd feel the way I do.</i> #

# <i>You changed my</i>
<i>life in so many ways.</i> #

# <i>And the moment that</i>
<i>we kissed, you showed me...</i> #

<i>You sure he said boyfriend?</i>

<i>He didn't say, boy</i>
<i>do I need a friend?</i>

Yeah, I don't know
what to say to him.

You know I look at him sometimes
and I have these feelings like...

I cherish him, but then
I always feel like I'm waiting...

for the other shoe to drop
like it always has.

He seems to be moving awfully
fast for a psychiatrist.

I mean the whole idea of this
romantic myth stuff is a recipe...

for disaster, he's a
shrink, he should know this.

Yeah, he is a shrink.

I think he knows more
about this stuff than us.

He has a degree,
we just have Oprah.

Oprah has made it impossible
for me to have a close...

relationship with
anyone, besides Oprah.

He's so normal and
I'm just, I'm such a freak.

We're really different.

I think that's good.

The thing about you gay guys
is that you're just obsessed...

with finding carbon
copies of yourself.

At least with guys and girls
we know we'll never figure...

each other out so we just say,
"Oh, he's just being a man"

or "Oh, she's just on the rag."

I guess.

Have you had a fight yet?

No.

Is that weird?

Well you do have some
things in common,

he 'two-steps' and
you 'twelve-step'.

You know maybe your
comedy is like my love life.

You know if you stop trying so
hard it will come, you know?

But fat jokes are my forte
and being fat is the only...

funny thing that
ever happened to me.

It's the only... thing some
idiot off the street...

would find
interesting about me.

Who are these for?

My friends Jeff and Jeff are
bringing their new foster child.

Ah, kids.

I saw some of those on TV once.

Ever think about having kids?

No, I already have one, myself.

I love children.

I can't imagine anybody
not loving kids.

Would you stop it?

Come here.

Hello.

<i>Hi!</i>

Hi. I'm Michael.

So Steve tells me
you used to be fat?

Oh Adam told me you
used to be short.

Were you like fat
or... circus fat?

You know you really ought to be
standing when you insult a lady.

Oh, wait, you already are.

What did you do with
all that loose skin,

did you like donate it to
a burn unit or something?

No, I gave it to the little
people, the real little people,

not the fake little
people like you.

Wow.

Cute kid, huh?

Wonder if she's gay.

Look, I just wanted to let you
know that I think it's cool...

that you and Steve are
hanging out and you know,

doing your gay love thing.

Awe, thanks Michael,
that's sweet.

Yeah.

I just, you know before he
met you he was such a whore.

Sorry, whore's get paid.

He was a slut.

He used to go to like the gym
every night and just go in...

the shower and hook up with
like hundreds of guys,

like the hottest guys in
New York for the taking.

To be honest with you, I can
never really understand...

why he would like give
up all that easy lovemaking,

but you know I
understand that you,

you know guys want
equal rights, so.

<i>Your best friend is cute.</i>

She's kind of a
bitch though, right?

Yeah.

What time do your folks get in?

They should be here
in about an hour.

Did you put away Michael's porn?

Yeah.

Did you put away Michael?

He's at a three stooges
convention at the Javitz Center.

Oh, I hope they like me.

Honey, you'll be fine.

They're the ones that should be
worried about what you think,

they're entering our world.

When you're
a born again Christian...

your world follows you.

Yeah, but they're not
that religious anymore.

Look, I've been
out for ten years,

they've had plenty of time
to get used to the idea...

that eventually
I'd meet somebody, huh?

Ew, Fags!

Welcome to the West Village
asshole, better get used to it!

Asshole.

You know, Jesus was a Jew.

That's right, he sure was.

Uh, would anybody care
for some wine?

That would be delightful.

Open that box of
Zinfandel we brought.

Show him what we
bought at the airport.

Now it's not for dinner,
it's just for decoration.

It was made from actual ceramic
chips recovered from the site.

Here we go.

Mom, dad, here we are.

Don't you want some?

Oh, no I'm an alcoholic.

He's in recovery.

Excuse us for a
minute, mom, dad.

I feel like I have a sign
under my neck that reads,

"I eat your son's ass".

Look, stop it, just act
like you normally do, okay?

We have to show them that there's
nothing wrong with being gay.

Look, they're in New
York now, not Texas.

Good lordy these
windows are so big!

I feel like I could
just fall right out.

Not exactly a ton of
privacy though is there?

Mom, dad, I just wanted to say
that normally Adam and I are...

very affectionate with each
other and we don't feel that...

it would be fair to us, or really
to you if we behaved in a way...

that somehow demonstrated that
we are in any way ashamed...

of our feelings for each other.

I think it's important that
we express our normal healthy...

affection for each
other in your presence.

Right?
And um, um...

Well, I just
wanted to say that.

Oh, well.

Don't not be ya'lls usual
selves, just cause we're here!

Yes.

We're all grown ups here.

Ew, fags!

So how would a person
find curtains for...

a window so big, son?

Well, you know, New York
is a very big city so...

<i>Cornholers!!</i>

How's that wine,
any left?

We don't have any
more boxes of wine,

I can open an actual bottle.

<i>Cocksuckers!!</i>

Cock screw's right
there on the counter.

Cork!

Got it, right here.

<i>Oh.</i>

Ah, I'm never having sex again.

No, they'll be fine.

No, they really liked you.

As your dad was leaving he
told me I was going to hell.

Yeah, well he only tries to
save the people he likes.

How come you never
talk about your family?

What are they, in the witness
protection program or something?

Uh, my family is really weird.

<i>They're not lucky.</i>

Adam, there's no such
thing as luck, okay?

Ah, yeah, there is.

Listen if you want to
meet them you can...

come with me to Hannukah
dinner in a few months.

If you still like me.

If I still like you?

Yeah, I know I'm just
making an assumption there.

Adam, come on.

I more than like you.

Adam...
I love you.

You just had to say
it first, didn't you?

I'm sorry, it's easier for
me to say it than to hear it.

Adam, I love you.

I love you.

I love, I love,
I love, love, love you...

Adam,
I do, I love you.

<i>Hey, it's Steve,</i>
<i>I am ridiculously in love</i>

<i>and therefore</i>
<i>extremely unreachable,</i>

<i>but leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

All right, this next comic
used to be really fat.

Which means now her pussy's
probably really tight because

no one's ever been in there.

<i>She's the hottest female</i>
<i>comic this side of...</i>

I can't think of any
hot female comics.

But even if you don't think
she's funny, and she's not,

then just turn her around
and look upon Rhonda Gernan...

and her amazing
heart shaped ass.

Thank you.
Wow.

You know, Lou, I always
knew you were crazy,

but in those pants I can see
your nuts and they're sad.

They're sad because
there's no one up there.

No pork, just beans.

No sausage for your
country breakfast.

No condiments for your meat.

No relish, no sauce.

Lou's so small.
Ask me how small he is?

<i>How small is he?</i>

Lou's so small his
last girlfriend...

was a pencil sharpener.

<i>Lou's so small</i>
<i>he doesn't get crabs,</i>

<i>he dates them.</i>

Lou's so small if he were a
drink he'd be a no piña colada.

<i>Knock, knock.</i>

Who's there?

Oh, I don't see anything,
I guess it's Lou's penis.

Well obviously there's
one man in the audience...

who's secure enough
with his masculinity...

to laugh at my jokes.

Hey.
Thanks for coming.

Oh yeah.

And laughing.

Yeah, hi.

You're, you're funny.

I just got fired.

All Lou did was complement
you on your ass,

why did you make fun of him?

Because in this heart
shaped ass is an asshole...

which is, I guess, what I am.

Gross.

It's good to see you have
fun with Gloria Steinam here.

You know I'm not with her,
she just sat next to me.

I'm not your mother.

Oh, well you kind
of look like her.

Well, that's good.

I'm late I've got to go
stare into a black hole.

You know I don't see
Steve as often as I used to...

ever since he
hooked up with Adam.

I think they're completely
wrong for each other.

Don't you agree?

Oh, come on their fags!

You know how it is.

Besides I think it's good,
Adam's luck has completely

changed since they met.
Why am I talking to you?

Hey, you want to get
a drink or something?

Like, it's so early.

You want to get a hot totty?

I try not to drink.

You don't get thirsty? You
know your body is 90% water.

Booze, it's the carbs!

Oh, right.

Are there
carbohydrates in pot?

Oh.

Wow, public access.

Do you believe they
get away with that?

Oh, hey look, American
Movie Classics.

You like that don't you?

Isn't it funny how the only
requirements for them to be...

a classic is that it
be over 40 years old.

I never thought of that.

You're funny.

Funny lady.

Oh my God,
I love that movie.

Oh my God me too, Steve makes
me watch it all the time,

except I think 'Funny Girl'
is much more satisfying.

Well, I think that's
the common opinion.

Yeah, that's the
common opinion...

Mmmm.

I've got the munchies.

My God what are you
doing, I can't eat that!

Oh, you can't have one pie?

<i>No I can't have one pie!</i>

One pie is like an
appetizer to me.

I eat that,
I unleash the beast!

Well then come on Rhonda,
unleash the beast!

I had a slip.

<i>- Thanks gents, have a good night.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

All right, okay.

Ah, you know I don't think
this is such a good idea.

What is the big deal?
Look you met my parents...

I want to meet yours.

All I'm saying is that they're...

I know, I know
they're not lucky.

They're kind of cursed.

Well if they're anything as
dramatic as their son Adam,

focus, okay, relax.

You always exaggerate
everything.

Go.

Go in!

Okay?

Go, it's okay.

Hello.

We're here.

Welcome home!

Darn it, we just replaced
that thing last week.

Happy Hannukah.

Whoa!

You must be Steve.

Hi.

Welcome, welcome,
welcome, welcome.

I'm Adam's father, I'm Norm and
this is Sherry and this is...

our beautiful daughter Ruth.

Hi, it's so nice to meet...
Ooh!

Uh-oh, did you bite your
tongue again sweetie?

Mm-hmm.

Hi.

Hi, Ruth, Mr., Mrs. Bernstein.

Thank you for having me.

Please call me Sherry,
any boyfriend of Adam's...

is a boyfriend of mine.

And that's right.

It's getting a little rare
having this one come around...

and visit us once in awhile.

I think he's
just a little embarrassed...

about the Bernstein curse.

Dad, there is no such thing.

You like that?
Are you enjoying?

<i>Mmm.</i>

<i>Steve, matza?</i>

Oh, yes, thank
you very much sir.

Thank you.

Seven more.

I thought that
was shatter proof.

All right.

I'm sorry, I just
have to ask this,

but are all of you
okay with this?

Well, I used to charge
people a quarter...

every time they asked
us that question,

but nobody
could afford it.

Lowered it to a nickel and
it still broke practically...

everybody's bank.

Happiness is accepting
life on life's terms.

You know I mean no matter
what they happen to be.

You just do your best with
what you've been given.

Till we found out we
were luck challenged,

we thought there was a
poltergeist or something.

We were on 'In Search Of'
in the 70s...

you know, with Spock.

Oh, we still have the tape,
we'll show it to you...

after we light the menorah.

Mom, could we
get through a Hannukah...

without watching that tape?

Adam just hates that tape,
he was a real pizza face...

back then you know.

Too busy with all that
white face paint to clear.

Anybody want coffee?

White face paint?

I was a goth in high school.

Who would like coffee?

Oh!

Well, we're out of coffee.

Uh, it's okay, it's kind
of late for coffee anyway.

You know what?

Let's spin the draidle
and open presents.

Yeah!

Well, now that you
have a special friend

I want to see more
of you around here.

Dad!

Steve is Adam's lover.
God, you are so square.

Oh, it was such a pleasure to
meet you Steve... oh, thank you.

I'm so happy that my Adam has
found someone as nice as you.

Oh, Sherry, look thanks
for making me feel so welcome,

and oh, for
such an amazing meal.

Well, it was made with love.

You know, I hate to see
you waste money

taking a taxi
to the train station.

Don't you want us
to give you a ride?

No!

Thank you, no.

I love you.

<i>Why can't a lesbian</i>
<i>diet and put on makeup...</i>

<i>at the same time?</i>

<i>I don't know, why?</i>

Cause you can't eat Jenny Craig
with Mary Kay on your face.

Does anyone know
what mothballs smell like?

Yes.

Oh really, how did you get them
to spread their little legs?

I have an audition
for a lesbian cruise ship...

next week,
very excited about it.

I like lesbians,
lesbians like me.

Trying to cut down on
the fat jokes though.

Mm, I still can't
even imagine you fat.

Oh, I can, oh, honey, show
Steve that photo of you.

No!

Yeah, come on.

No, I look like
a Long Island blimp...

with a bad
Chinese lady perm.

No.

Speaking of Long Island, you
know we went to Long Island...

last week, we went to
Adam's parents' house.

Oh my God, I was there
once and a piece of space lab...

splashed down into their pool.

Oh my God!

Actually...

I'm going to
ask Adam to marry me.

Oh my God!

You're going to marry him!

But you guys have only been
going out for a couple months.

Actually it's almost
been a year Michael,

besides my parents got
married on the third date...

and they're still together.

Well you're only as
monogamous as your options.

I mean your parents live in
a trailer park in a field.

Excuse me!

Only as monogamous
as their options!

You know it gets worse Michael,
I'm going to ask him to move in.

Oh my God!

I knew this day
was going to come.

You know you said you needed a
place to crash for the night...

and you've been living on
my couch for five years.

Jesus, Michael, be
happy for them.

I think it's great.

He's going to flip out.

He really loves you.

I love him too, I do.

You know it's funny when I was
a kid I just supposed I'd get

married like everybody
else, but I don't know,

turned out I was gay and I just
figured it wasn't in the cards.

But I mean I don't even know
what I think of marriage anyway.

Sometimes I think it's
a dying institution.

Yeah, well it is,
then you fall in love.

Exactly.

Sometimes I look
at him and I think,

this is not the person I
was supposed to end up with,

but I don't know,
somehow it's all okay.

So who gets to wear the dress?

You do.

Hi.

Hey, good lookin'.

Hey.

Wait a minute, come
here, come here.

I um, I want to take
you someplace. Okay?

Oh God, please don't tell me
there's something...

called three stepping.

No, it's just my favorite
place in the city.

You game?

Yeah.

Let's go.
Okay.

The Brooklyn Bridge,
that's your favorite place?

Uh huh.

Let's go, come on, come on!

God, I haven't
been here in years,

it's getting harder to remember
where the towers were, you know?

You were in New York on
that day, what was it like?

Oh, I don't know,
it was just crazy.

These are crazy times, makes
things like, I don't know,

security, commitment,
more important.

I can't believe
that you brought me here.

My drug problem began
on this very spot.

Well, no, actually it
began at Danceateria,

this club in the 80's.

This go-go boy coke head with
big old like Dee Snyder hair.

He was part of some dance
troop, what was it called?

Oh, the Dazzle Dancers.

Well he fed me my first hit
of blow and we went back to

my place and he shit right in
front of me, all over my carpet.

Oh, my place looked like
something out of

Willy Wonka after he left.

Oh, and he was singing
some song from the...

what was it from?

Like the <i>Sound of Music.</i>

Oh my God, how could
I have forgotten that?

Oh my God.

Oh my Jesus, oh my God.

Honey.

Oh my God.

I have to get out of here,
all I can see is disaster.

No, disaster!

I need time to think Adam!

Time to think!

Think!

Where are you going?

So he just ran away
yelling "disaster"?

Yeah.

We were talking about
the World Trade Center...

and what happened
and he just freaked out.

Well, he is a doctor
in New York City.

He was in Province Town on 9/11.

Well, he'll call you
when he's ready.

Everybody gets the
jitters before.

Before what?

The next big terrorist attack.

Uh!

Oh!!

He just dumped me!

What!

In the shower.

Oh my God!

There ain't no God!

Did he say why?

Just that,
he wasn't ready...

and he said I didn't
really know who he was!

Oh my God, why is
this happening?

It's the Bernstein curse!

You know, you date...

You look for the person who has
the least amount of flaws...

and then you find someone
who you think is about...

as perfect as you can get.

Oh, but of course there's
no such thing as perfection.

Why do people project this
image of themselves...

that's like completely
opposite from who they are?

Maybe they're just
afraid they won't be...

loved for who
they really are.

But that's crazy.

I mean you come home one day and
you think you know this person...

and then all of a sudden
you realize you do not...

know this person from Adam.

I need to speak
with Steven Hicks.

Are you one of his patients?

Don't make me go
Shirley McClaine on you.

You better give that guy some
closure or he's going to...

wind up in here
in a body cast.

Look, look, I appreciate you
standing up for your friend,

but I did give Adam
closure, all right?

In a shower stall.

All right, okay, I admit it
was perhaps a little abrupt...

but what in the world...

One minute you're telling
me you want to marry him,

all that bullshit
about commitment...

and you're a total slut.

Look, you don't understand
the situation, okay?

There are things about me you
just don't know, all right?

Like what?

Like... we just aren't
right for each other.

We...

He doesn't really love me.

We were co-dependent and then...

There are things
about being co-de,

it's called depending
on another person.

You act like you're so grown up
like you're so above it,

but you're an
asshole and a baby.

You're an asshole
who's also a baby!

I'm getting marriage advice
from some gay whore, great.

All right, let me
get this straight.

You meet Adam in 1987.

You turn him into a coke head
and then you poop on him.

All in the same night?

It wasn't my fault.

It was cut with...

baby laxative.

I've had some bad dates
but nothing like,

you know, biohazard.

How could we have
dated for so long...

and never recognized
each other?

Oh, it was the 80s,
it was a long time ago.

You know you're like
Simon LeBon, in a boat,

looking through the jungle for
the cat lady and you know...

he was like the guy with a fiddle
and the suspenders singing;

"Come On Eileen".

Or you could just...

You could tell
him who you were.

No, no Michael.
No, he can't find out.

Michael don't you dare say
a word to him, or Rhonda.

Michael, do you hear me?

I told you, I don't know,
I just know that he said...

Adam isn't the one.

Michael.
What?

Michael.

Michael,
is that the whole story?

Well, there's the other thing.

What?

What other thing, Michael.

About Adam and Steve.

It's kind of gross, I think I
should tell you after dinner.

Why?

What do you know Michael?

<i>Ahhhhh!</i>

And uh, then he broke up
with me... in the shower.

Steve was
the go-go dancer!

Excuse me, this is
a private meeting.

Silence, sober one!

What go-go dancer.

From Danceateria!

The Hershey squirtin'
coke head!

Excuse me, you are
challenging our serenity.

Shut up!

Wait, from the 80's?

Willy Wonka?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Adam! Steve loves you, he just
can't get past his humiliation...

over the diarrhea thing
and for turning you into...

some gay John Belushi.

That's why he broke up with you!

But that is crazy.

God, you're right, he is
totally unaware for a shrink.

I'm telling you, they're
like preacher's kids.

Cross talking is not allowed.

Mary, please!

He's so confused.

No, he's just an
asshole and a baby.

He's a baby who's
also an asshole.

Where are you going?
Ah!

Adam, if you imagine it,
you can achieve it.

If you dream it,
you could become it.

Yeah!

<i>Adam, Adam, wait up.</i>

Adam, I'm sorry okay.

I have nothing to say to you.

Look, I felt like I created this
cocaine monster and unleashed

him onto the gay community
to wreak havoc on midgets.

Adam, look... I gave you
your first bump of coke.

I...

I became incontinent
in front of you.

Became incontinent?

God, you are
such an old lady.

<i>You're just embarrassed.</i>

Yes, all right, yes I am.

I'd be happy to course through
life having a lover who thought...

I never went to
the bathroom at all.

Who thought that some
little dove just came...

and swept it all away
when I wasn't looking.

Wait.

What!
What do you want?

I don't know, okay?

I don't want some open
relationship like...

all the gay couples I know.

I don't want some, some gay version
of the straight couples I see!

I don't see
what I want anywhere.

Then just see me.

You know we're just us,
we're not gay or straight...

or Julia or Meg,
we're just two people...

Adam and Steve.

Maybe we should just accept
the fact that neither of those...

people are
relationship material.

That... they're both too damaged.

We're in our thirties,
of course we're damaged.

And you know what?
I am tired.

I am tired of fighting you
and the whole world just so...

I could have something
as radical and subversive...

as a fucking boyfriend.

Fuck you, Steve!

I may be damaged goods but
I am goods nonetheless.

It's not my fault!

You wouldn't understand, she's
a woman, they have their ways!

What, she hypnotized you
with her feminine wiles?

Yes, yes, yes she
did, she did actually!

What?

What was I supposed
to do, Michael?

Every time he went to an
AA meeting, I'd feel guilty.

Every time I used the
bathroom he'd stare at me...

with a knowing look on his face.

Get over yourself!

The guy saw you take a dump.

You'd eventually start changing
each other's diapers anyway.

No, no, this is not how
it's supposed to be.

You've got to stop with
that preconceived bullshit.

You guys love each
other, don't you?

I don't even know what
that means anymore.

<i>Fags!</i>

<i>God made Adam and Eve,</i>
<i>not Adam and Steve!</i>

Where, are you go...

There you go, guys.

I've got to go get limes
honey, I'll be right back.

# <i>You don't get much-a nothing</i>
<i>unless you give it a try.</i> #

# <i>Rock the world a little, get</i>
<i>the thunder clapping.</i> #

# <i>March yourself over there</i>
<i>and make things happen.</i> #

# <i>Give yourself a</i>
<i>gift you can use.</i> #

# <i>What the hell have</i>
<i>you got to lose?</i> #

# <i>We're really all just</i>
<i>walking in each other's shoes.</i> #

# <i>Step one; look.</i>
<i>Two; smile.</i> #

# <i>Three; say 'Hi'.</i> #

# <i>Say 'Hi'!</i> #

Hi.

Hi.

This is Charlie, he uh...

he lives across
the street from me.

Hi.

Hi.

Go ahead.

Ask him.

Ask him.

What's your name?

Adam.

What's mine?

Steve.

That's right Steve,
Adam and Steve.

So see you were wrong.

God did make Adam and
Steve because here we are.

Tell him, huh, tell him.

Steve is sorry for the
way he treated you,

he's sorry about everything.

Well, I accept his apology.

And...

I'm sorry
I yelled at you,

called you cornholers
in front of his parents.

Okay.

What else, what else!

He wants to ask you
for your hand...

in one of them
gay marriages.

A man marrying a man,
that's kind of gross.

I know.

Well you tell him that
personally I don't really...

believe in marriage
and I don't really know...

if I really believe
in him anymore.

Whoa, that's harsh!

Adam, please.

I can't.

Adam.

I choose you, I choose you.

I don't know why you would.

# <i>Perhaps I had</i>
<i>a wicked childhood.</i> #

# <i>Perhaps I</i>
<i>had a miserable youth.</i> #

# <i>But somewhere in my wicked,</i>
<i>miserable past,</i> #

# <i>there must have been</i>
<i>a moment of truth.</i> #

# <i>For here you are,</i>
<i>standing there, loving me.</i> #

# <i>Whether or</i>
<i>not you should.</i> #

# <i>So somewhere in my youth,</i>
<i>or childhood.</i> #

# <i>I must have</i>
<i>done something good.</i> #

# <i>Nothing comes from nothing,</i>
<i>nothing ever could.</i> #

# <i>So somewhere in</i>
<i>my youth or childhood,</i> #

# <i>I must have</i>

Beloved family and
friends at this time...

in the wedding
we do the ring ceremony.

Rhonda if you would give
me Adam's ring for Steve.

Thank you.

Michael if you would give
me Steve's ring for Adam.

Thank you.

Hold hands.

Father Mother God we ask
just now for your blessing...

on these beautiful
wedding rings...

that they may symbolize
for Adam and Steve...

in their union health and
happiness, strength and courage,

joy and peace, abundance
and prosperity,

and unconditional
loving for each other.

So be it.

Adam if you would place this
ring on Steven's hand...

and repeat after me.

Steve, with this
ring I thee wed.

Steve, with this
ring I thee wed.

Steve, if you would place
this ring on Adam's hand...

and repeat after me.

Adam, with this ring I thee wed.

Adam, with this ring I thee wed.

Do you Adam Bernstein
take Steve Hicks...

to be your beloved husband?

I do.

Steve Hicks, do you
take Adam Bernstein...

to be your beloved husband?

You bet your ass I do.

And now by the power vested
in me by the state of New York,

I now pronounce you
husband and husband.

You may kiss your beloved.

And now Adam in the
tradition of your family,

we'll break the glass.

Mazoltov!
