<i>Good evening.</i>

<i>The following are</i>
<i>the lowest temperature estimates</i>

<i>for California citrus areas.</i>

<i>Lowest temperatures tomorrow night</i>
<i>will be somewhat higher than tonight</i>

<i>and only light scattered firing late</i>
<i>in the morning should be necessary.</i>

<i>Corona District: Corona 29,</i>
<i>Arlington 28, Riverside 27,</i>

<i>Highgrove 27, Elsinore 26, Marino 26.</i>

<i>Clear and calm, firing for lemons will be</i>

<i>Well, the night before I met her,</i>
<i>I was in my hotel room on Bunker Hill</i>

<i>down in the very middle of Los Angeles.</i>

<i>It was called the Alta Loma.</i>

<i>It was built on a hillside in reverse</i>

<i>so that the main floor</i>
<i>was on a level with the street.</i>

<i>My room was down on the fifth floor</i>

<i>so that my window was on a level</i>
<i>with the green hillside,</i>

<i>and there was no need for a key.</i>

<i>The window was always open.</i>

<i>I'd been going over the plans I'd made,</i>
<i>since I'd come here like everyone else</i>

<i>in search of fortune, fame, good health</i>
<i>and glamorous women.</i>

<i>Only I was going to be different.</i>

<i>Only I was going to be different.</i>

<i>I wasn't here to search for my future.</i>
<i>I was here to create it.</i>

<i>I'd write the first great novel</i>
<i>about this place</i>

<i>and everybody who came here</i>
<i>from somewhere else.</i>

The Road to Los Angeles
<i>by Arturo Bandini.</i>

<i>It would bring me everything</i>
<i>I ever wanted.</i>

<i>Now, after five months, I was trying</i>
<i>to make a very important decision.</i>

<i>What to do with my last nickel.</i>

<i>"Mr. Bandini, it has now been six weeks</i>
<i>since you've paid the rent.</i>

<i>"Four dollars per is mounting</i>
<i>like the national debt.</i>

<i>"Either you pay $24, every penny,</i>
<i>or pack up and leave."</i>

<i>It was her sixth note in six weeks.</i>

<i>Pretty humiliating.</i>

<i>My landlady was getting</i>
<i>more writing done than I was.</i>

<i>She was the kind of woman</i>
<i>who increased her height</i>

<i>by rising on tiptoe</i>
<i>and peering at me over her glasses.</i>

-I'd like a room.
-Do you have a job?

I'm a writer.

I'll be with you in a moment, Mr. Archer.

Wrote that.

Here. What's your name?

Mrs. Hargraves, why?

"For Mrs. Hargraves.

"A woman of ineffable charm,

"with lovely blue eyes
and a generous smile.

"From the author, Arturo Bandini."

"The Little Dog Laughed."

I hate dog stories.

Bandini. Young man,
are you a Mexican?

Me, a Mexican?

I'm an American, Mrs. Hargraves.
And that isn't a dog story, either.

We don't allow Mexicans in this hotel.

I'm not a Mexican,
and there isn't a dog in the whole story.

We don't allow Jews, either.

I got that title after the fable, you know,

"And the little dog laughed
To see such sport"

So you're an author. How nice.

Here we are, Mr. Bandini.
This is one of my very favorite rooms.

There are windows on two sides,
which makes it extremely airy.

It's $4 a week,
and I expect to be paid in advance.

Now that includes cleaning
but no laundry. We never do...

<i>Through that window,</i>

<i>I saw my first palm tree</i>
<i>not six feet away,</i>

<i>but the palm was blackish</i>
<i>at its branches.</i>

-And no girls in the room.
-I'll take it.

<i>Stained by carbon monoxide</i>
<i>coming out of the Third Street Tunnel,</i>

<i>its crusted trunk choked</i>
<i>with dust and sand</i>

<i>that blew in from the Mojave</i>
<i>and Santa Ana deserts.</i>

<i>What jerk's gonna believe</i>
<i>I made it all the way</i>

<i>from Colorado to downtown L.A.</i>
<i>without seeing one goddamn palm tree?</i>

Kid?

Kid?

Kid.

Do you like milk?

Yes, Hellfrick. I like milk.

Okay, then.

Here's the plan.

The Adohr man's a friend of mine.

Every morning at 4:00,
he parks his truck behind the hotel

and comes up to my room for a while.

-That's not much of a plan, Hellfrick.
-No, kid, no.

While he's having one with me,

you get 10 minutes
to help yourself to the milk.

So what do you think?

If he's your friend,
why not just ask him for it?

Kid, come on. Who's kidding who?

He knows I don't drink milk.
I'm doing this for you.

No, thanks, Hellfrick.
I like to consider myself an honest man.

It certainly makes me wonder
about your ideas of friendship.

Okay.

Only trying to do you a favor.

You wanna do me a favor?
Pay me the money I loaned you.

-How much was that?
-Fifteen cents.

-Don't have it.
-Well, how about 10 cents? A nickel?

Can't give you any hard cash, kid,

but I'll see you get all the milk you need.

<i>Mencken. Editor of the greatest</i>
<i>magazine in the country.</i>

<i>Do you wanna let him down?</i>

<i>Good evening,</i>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. North and South America</i>

<i>and all the ships and clippers at sea.</i>
<i>Akron, Ohio.</i>

<i>A big strike in the Goodrich</i>
<i>rubber plant here was called off today</i>

<i>when workers agreed</i>
<i>on a six cent raise in pay per hour.</i>

<i>Boston, Massachusetts.</i>

<i>The condition</i>
<i>of Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.,</i>

<i>who was hurt today in a motorcar crash</i>
<i>near Walpole, Massachusetts,</i>

<i>is not serious.</i>

Think of something
besides stealing a bottle of milk.

You're an author, not a thief.

<i>The streets are full of them,</i>
<i>blondes and brunettes.</i>

<i>One in a red fox fur just getting out</i>
<i>of a fancy foreign car.</i>

<i>Girls in the plaza.</i>

<i>They're everywhere,</i>
<i>and none of them mine.</i>

<i>One glance and they know</i>
<i>I'm an inexperienced jerk,</i>

<i>ignorant of women and life,</i>
<i>and afraid of both.</i>

You have nice hands.

I do?

Very.

Bandini?

You're Italian.

That'll be two cents a day
every day it's overdue.

<i>St. Teresa, when I was little,</i>
<i>I prayed to you for a fountain pen.</i>

You answered my prayer.
Anyway, I got a fountain pen.

Now please, sweet and lovely Saint,

inspire me. Give me an idea,
so I can write a story,

a great story,

so I can be rich and famous
and not be ashamed of my name.

Door is open.

To you, Mencken. To the future.

<i>I headed down Third Street looking</i>
<i>for a place to spend my last nickel.</i>

<i>And there it was.</i>

Come on.
Learn to dance if you can't walk!

<i>The perfect place to end up flat broke.</i>

-Can I get you something?
-Coffee with cream.

<i>Just five months ago,</i>
<i>I had $150 in my pocket</i>

<i>and big plans in my head.</i>

<i>In those days, I was Arturo Bandini,</i>
<i>lover of man and beast alike.</i>

<i>All I needed was to meet one</i>
<i>of those beautiful golden-haired girls</i>

<i>that seemed to grow like oranges</i>
<i>out here,</i>

<i>and I'd write a story, a love story,</i>
<i>one of the greatest of all time.</i>

Who brought this here?

There you go, Tony.

Thank you.

Are you done with that coffee?

You call this stuff coffee?
Maybe it isn't coffee at all.

Maybe it's just water after they boiled
your filthy shoes in it.

Maybe you don't know any better.
Maybe you're just naturally careless.

But if I were you,
I wouldn't be seen in a Main Street alley

wearing those <i>haraches.</i>

It's <i>huaraches,</i> not <i>haraches.</i>

I hope you die of heart failure right there
on that chair.

Camilla.

It's not my fault. I didn't do nothing.

I swear to God, I just asked him
if he wanted some coffee!

Take care of it.

If he's sick, get him out of here.

Hey.

Young fellow, are you all right?

You there? Oh, say something, please.

You can dish it out, but you can't take it,
can you?

You want the nickel?

Then mop it up.

Hey, you!

<i>Sand from the Mojave</i>
<i>was blowing across the city.</i>

<i>It was everywhere.</i>

<i>It was even between the sheets,</i>
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

<i>All I could think about</i>
<i>were those</i> huaraches.

<i>"To a Mayan princess</i>
<i>from a worthless gringo."</i>

What's the name of the girl
who works here?

You mean Camilla?

The one who was here yesterday.
The Mexican.

Camilla Lopez.

Will you give this to her?

Take good care of it. It's valuable.
See that Miss Lopez gets it personally.

<i>The truth was, I couldn't afford</i>
<i>to go back and see her that night.</i>

<i>I didn't have a nickel for a cup of coffee.</i>

What do you want?

I'm an honest man, kid.

There, see if he wants a beer
on the house.

Sorry about the coffee.

Everybody orders beer around here.
We don't get that many calls for coffee.

I can see why.
I'd drink beer, too, if I could afford it.

Anyway, I hope this is better.
You want cream, right?

Not bad. Certainly an improvement
over last night.

Did you read "The Little Dog Laughed"?

"The Little Dog Laughed,"
by me, Arturo Bandini.

Arturo?

Bandini. It's Italian.
Did you read the story?

-Sure.
-So?

It's very good.

Hey, listen. You want a beer?

I can get you some.
You don't have to pay.

What did you like about it?

-Camilla.
-I have to go.

You still haven't told me
what you thought.

I told you. I liked it. I like dog stories.

-You like dog stories.
-I like dogs a lot...

-There's no dog in the story.
-There's no dog...

There's no dog in the story!

Okay. I heard you.

Then why did you call it
"The Little Dog Laughter"?

Why did you lie to me? Why did you
just say you read it when you didn't?

Listen, kid. Please, drink your beer.

It's tough enough just to have
a good time, okay?

Sir! Sir!

Forgot your hat.

-Something else you wanted to say?
-Camilla can't read.

Not English, anyway.

<i>And another thing, Mr. Mencken,</i>
<i>I have no understanding of women.</i>

<i>How can I write about</i>
<i>what I don't understand?</i>

<i>How can I write about experiences</i>
<i>I haven't had?</i>

<i>When I first came here,</i>
<i>I was so sure of myself.</i>

<i>So sure I wasn't like the others.</i>

<i>The others came to the land of sunshine</i>
<i>with just enough money to live</i>

<i>until the sun killed them.</i>

<i>Take Hellfrick, across the hall,</i>
<i>from Minnesota.</i>

<i>Gassed in the Great War</i>
<i>and gassed ever since.</i>

<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>he has no idea where he is.</i>

<i>So, I guess here is as good</i>
<i>as anywhere else.</i>

<i>Heilman's a bank teller</i>
<i>from South Bend.</i>

<i>But his health is bad and he was told</i>
<i>he had to stay here or die.</i>

<i>He hates the sun and the fog</i>
<i>and the SC Trojans.</i>

<i>My landlady's from Back East.</i>

<i>She tries to make the hotel lobby</i>
<i>look like Bridgeport, Connecticut.</i>

<i>No Mexicans and lots of doilies.</i>

-Will there be anything else, ma'am?
-No, thank you.

<i>Then there's the Filipino houseboy</i>
<i>from Hawaii</i>

<i>and the redhead from St. Louis.</i>

-Hello.
-Hello.

-How are you?
-Better now.

<i>She's come to feel he's terribly brave</i>
<i>in the face of so much prejudice.</i>

<i>The other day when I was going</i>
<i>to San Pedro,</i>

<i>looking for work at the canneries,</i>
<i>I saw them.</i>

<i>Even with high leather heels,</i>
<i>he was a foot shorter than she was.</i>

<i>I don't know where the girl</i>
<i>in the red fox fur is from,</i>

<i>but you can find her in Bernstein's Fish</i>
<i>Grotto with a fresh one every week.</i>

<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>there's the Japanese man</i>

<i>who grows his vegetables</i>
<i>down on Jefferson, near the sloughs.</i>

<i>Bullet-faced and always smiling,</i>
<i>he keeps me alive for a nickel.</i>

You like plums? Good. Good for you.

<i>Of course there are others too poor</i>
<i>and too unlucky</i>

<i>to be allowed to call</i>
<i>any place their own.</i>

<i>Even for a while.</i>

All right, <i>amigos.</i>

<i>In the end, we're all strangers here.</i>

<i>Maybe the only thing that makes you</i>
<i>a Californian is a pair of sunglasses</i>

<i>and a four-bit polo shirt.</i>
<i>Suddenly, you belong.</i>

Mr. Bandini. You have mail.

<i>"Dear Mr. Bandini,</i>
<i>with your permission,</i>

<i>"I shall remove the salutation</i>
<i>and ending of your very long letter</i>

<i>"and print it as a short story</i>
<i>for my magazine.</i>

<i>"It seems you've done a fine job here.</i>

<i>"I think 'The Land of Somewhere Else'</i>
<i>would serve as an excellent title.</i>

<i>"Check enclosed.</i>
<i>Sincerely yours, H.L. Mencken.</i>

<i>"P.S. As to your anxieties</i>
<i>about your limited experiences</i>

<i>"with life in general</i>
<i>and women in particular,</i>

<i>"it is, alas, a truism that authors</i>
<i>generally have less experience</i>

<i>"than other men.</i>

<i>"This owing to the incontestable fact</i>

<i>"that you simply can't be</i>
<i>in two places at once, Mr. Bandini.</i>

<i>"Either you're in front</i>
<i>of the typewriter, writing,</i>

<i>"or you're out in the world</i>
<i>having experiences.</i>

<i>"Therefore, since you need to write</i>
<i>and you need to have experiences</i>

<i>"to write about,</i>
<i>you have to learn to do more with less.</i>

<i>"And doing more with less is,</i>
<i>in a word, Mr. Bandini,</i>

<i>"what writing is all about."</i>

Still mad at me?

Not that I know of.

Well, would you like
to order something?

A cigar. Something from Havana.

They're a quarter.

Keep the change.

-I said keep the change.
-Not from you.

You're poor.

Don't I look different?

I thought you'd like my shoes.

They're very nice.

How about something to drink?
Scotch highball.

Saint James.

Sammy, get me a highball.
Saint James.

You've changed.

Before you were just mean.

Now that you've got a couple of bucks,
you're mean and stuck-up.

Forty cents.

Well, you haven't changed.

You're just the same little
Mexican princess,

-charming and innocent.
-I'm not charming and I'm not innocent.

To me you'll always be a sweet
little peon, a flower girl from old Mexico.

You dago son of a bitch!

I'm just as American as you are.

Or at least I will be
as soon as I pass my test.

Sure you will,
just as soon as you learn how to read.

Take off those shoes.

My legs are not good enough for them?

They're not good enough for your legs.

Sorry what I called you.
I didn't mean what I said.

I didn't either.

-You got a car?
-No.

I do. It's in the parking lot.

It's a '27 convertible.

The stuffing, it's a little bit
out of the upholstery, but it runs.

I'm off at 11:00.

Camilla Lombard?

Arturo.

-This is Sammy.
-Hi.

Are you coming?

Have a good night.

Be right back.

Who is he?

Sammy? Just a friend.

What kind of a friend?

A good one.

He got me my job.

-They let the bartender hire you?
-Sammy's not just the bartender.

Oh, yeah?
What else is he, a concert pianist?

Listen, Arturo,
you're not the only writer in town.

-Sammy's a writer?
-You'd be surprised.

I'd be surprised
if he could write his name.

Do you like my car?

How come it's registered to
Camilla Lombard? Your name's Lopez.

-You married?
-No.

-So what's the Lombard for?
-For fun.

-Sometimes I use it professionally.
-As a waitress?

Do you like your name?

Don't you wish it was Johnson
or Williams or something?

-No.
-Come on.

Do you honestly like
being called Bandini?

-I'm satisfied with my name.
-No, you're not.

-I am.
-You're not.

-I am.
-You're not.

-I am.
-You're not.

What's Sammy's last name,
Johnson or Williams?

White.

Pretty much sums up your ambition
in life, doesn't it? To be Mrs. White?

You can be a real son of a bitch,
you know that?

-Are you still cold?
-No.

The cliffs keep you warm.

They're like a blanket
when you're underneath them.

Why do you get so mean?

Why do you get so mean?

Can't we be friends?

Friends like you and Sammy?

Look at the fog.

An army of ghosts crawling
on their bellies.

What are you talking about?

The fog bank.
It creeps in and hugs the water.

-You didn't answer my question.
-I know what a fog bank is.

And what about you and Sammy?

Who are you interested in,
me or Sammy?

Come on, why don't you teach me
how to ride a wave?

Out there, in all this fog?

Yeah, why not?

Are you afraid?

Of course not.

What are you waiting for?

Come in! Come here!

Come here! Come on!

Get in here!

What are you hiding?

You got a pretty one.
Pink as a baby's bottom.

Relax. Let's have some fun.

-You're not gonna ride a wave tonight.
-Sure I will. You show me how.

I'm from Colorado.

You mean you don't know
how to ride a wave?

Listen. My technique might be not good
for you to learn. It's unorthodox.

That's okay. I'd like to learn from you.

The first thing you gotta do is
get to where the waves are.

Don't take any chances.
Just stay back, stay right there.

I will, I promise.

Just watch me...

-Help!
-Camilla!

Camilla?

Camilla! Camilla!

Oh, God. Camilla!

Camilla!

Where'd she go? Where'd she go?

Camilla! Camilla!

Camilla!

Fooled you pretty good!

It was as good as your heart attack.

-Admit it.
-It was better.

You can dish it out,
but you can't take it, huh?

Cut it out!

It was a joke, God damn it!
What are you trying to do, drown me?

I'll never forgive you.
Not for my whole life.

I thought your life was over.

I thought I was gonna die
looking for you.

That was my first time in the ocean.

What you gonna do now, walk home?

It's 10 miles to downtown.
Where do you live?

The Alta Loma.

Bunker Hill.

Old women and weak men.
Perfect place for you.

Couldn't be better.
In my hotel they don't allow Mexicans.

White dough.

No wonder she laughed. Who wouldn't?

Arturo Bandini, genius,
man of the world,

can't take a walk on the beach
without trying to hide his dick.

<i>I never wanted to see you again.</i>
<i>You were so mean last night.</i>

<i>Get in.</i>

<i>What for?</i>

<i>Get in.</i>

<i>Arturo, don't stop.</i>

<i>Please don't ever stop. Arturo...</i>

Jesus Christ, Hellfrick!

Have you ever heard of knocking
before you come into a room?

Sorry, kid. Didn't mean to disturb you.

Artist at work, huh?

Listen, kid.

How much dough you got?

-Oh, for Christ's sake!
-No, no, no, it's not for booze.

-Well, then what's it for?
-Meat.

Meat?

I mean like the steaks you used to get
Back East.

Real meat. Not like out here.

Sure. Cattle are different out here.

Absolutely.

Here's always sunny and dry.
Cows eat nothing but weeds.

Dead weeds. Meat's full of worms.

They paint it to look bloody and red.
Did you know that?

Maybe you could use that
in one of your...

Okay, okay. What do you need?

Fifty cents? There's a butcher on Olive.

He's got the real McCoy,
beef from Kansas City.

It would help keep me off the hard stuff.

I'll make it good with you, kid.

I'll pay you back 1,000 times.

<i>I had just under $10.</i>

<i>It would pay the rent</i>
<i>for two-and-a-half weeks</i>

<i>or buy me three pairs of shoes</i>
<i>or two pairs of pants</i>

<i>or 1,000 postage stamps</i>
<i>to send stories to Mencken.</i>

<i>But you don't have any stories or talent.</i>

"Don't stop. Don't stop.
Please don't ever stop."

Garbage.

Camilla. Camilla, wait up.

-Did you ask him?
-What's in it for him?

Just do it.

Who is it?

-Hello.
-What are you doing?

Do I know you?

Who are you?

"He took her roughly in his arms.

"She pressed herself
against his throbbing loins.

"'Don't stop! Don't ever stop."'

-Hey, that's private.
-I hope so.

It should never be made public.

It's pitiful and sad.

A hopelessly bad writer
buried in a cheap hotel on Bunker Hill.

In Los Angeles, of all places.

-They'll never read what you write.
-That's not really my writing.

They won't even have a chance
to forget it.

Say, what's going on?
Where did you come from?

-Is this a gag?
-You're nobody.

I might have been somebody,

and here we are.

Lady. Lady, you've got to sober up.

How about a little fresh air?

We could go out
and have a drink. Money.

Lady?

Good idea. Let's have a drink.

You are gonna be so marvelous!
So wonderful!

-My landlady.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

-Forget it, now. Let's just walk.
-Okay, but we're having a drink.

I insist. Look, money!

Okay, we'll have a drink.
Just put it back in your purse.

-Hey, Mr. Bandini.
-Hi, Solomon. How's business?

Till you showed up, Mr. Bandini, I had
more pinball machines than customers.

-A short beer, am I right?
-And whiskey.

Lots of whiskey.

Does he know you?

Your mouth, your wonderful mouth.
God, what a mouth.

No, let's have a drink first.

-What's wrong?
-You know what's wrong.

-No, I don't.
-You're just like the rest of them.

-You know!
-Know what?

-That's why you won't kiss me!
-Here we go. One short beer.

And double whiskey.

-So who was it?
-Who was what?

Who told you about my wounds?

Your wounds?

Do you have a nickel?
I love pinball machines.

One game. Would you mind?

-Whatever my darling wishes.
-Thank you.

Solomon, could you come over here?
For some reason, it's on tilt.

Play. Play.

Who is that woman?

Who knows?

She was in a week before last,

when you were talking
about Sinclair Lewis

to that couple from Minnesota.

-I didn't notice her.
-Well, she noticed you, believe you me.

Listened to every word you said.
Every single word.

-And when you left, she left.
-And what's she doing now?

-Watching you like a prize dog.
-I gotta get out of here.

Door opposite the men's room.

Is everything all right, darling?
Do you need another nickel?

No. No, I'm just gonna use...

-Oh, my God!
-Darling.

I took a cab and the door was open.

Don't you think this has gone
far enough?

"I see them in the lobbies of hotels.

"I see them sunning in the parks
and limping out of little ugly churches,

"dispossessed in this place
where the seasons never change."

That's more like it.

Will you please get out?

You're my darling,
and you're going to love me.

Some other time. I think you better go.
I mean it.

I know how I revolt you,

that you know what my clothes
are covering up.

Know what?
I don't even know your name.

Vera Rivkin.

Back East I had a real life

and friends who knew about
H.L. Mencken

and Edna St. Vincent Millay.

Now I'm a housekeeper.

I work for a nice Jewish family
in Long Beach.

I'm tired. Tired of housekeeping.

Then one day, I saw you at Solomon's,

and I heard you talk.

And I went and I bought your story.

And I read it.

And I felt that you were someone

who could look at me
and see me for what I am.

So I followed you home.

So stupid.

Hopeless.

But I'm really a good person.
Honestly, I am.

Here.

Thank you.

-What do you want me to do?
-Tell me I'm like other women.

-Tell me I'm beautiful, please.
-But you are beautiful.

Really, you are.

This is just a childish obsession.

You know, maybe a hangover
from the mumps. I don't know.

Plenty of men would give anything...

Let me show you something.

-You don't have to show me anything.
-You're going to see it for yourself.

Undo this, please.

Look, you've convinced me, all right?

Yeah. Yeah, I thought so.

You know all about them.

So what's the fuss? That's nothing.

Tell that to my husband.

"Deformed, disfigured,

"disgusting."

That's what he said.

I say,

you're beautiful.

Excuse me.

I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry. I don't know
what was in my head. I just...

Take it easy.
I'll wait outside so you can...

Take it easy.

<i>"Dear Boy,</i>

<i>"of course I should have known</i>
<i>you'd have a girlfriend.</i>

<i>"Is she very beautiful?</i>

<i>"She's very lucky.</i>

<i>"Is she also kind and generous?</i>

<i>"Would she ever allow you to come</i>
<i>to Long Beach, if only for an hour?"</i>

<i>I woke up relieved to think</i>

<i>there were other possibilities in life</i>
<i>besides Camilla.</i>

<i>Maybe Vera was a little crazy,</i>
<i>but like she said about herself,</i>

<i>she was a good person.</i>

<i>We'd read the same books,</i>
<i>spoke the same language</i>

<i>and she was capable</i>
<i>of appreciating my writing.</i>

<i>Suddenly, I felt better about myself.</i>
<i>I was once again, Arturo Bandini,</i>

<i>lover of man and beast alike,</i>
<i>and afraid of nothing.</i>

Mr. Bandini! Hey! Bandini!

It's Sammy,
the bartender at the Columbia.

-Yeah. Sammy White.
-Yeah.

-Camilla says you've been published.
-What of it?

I was thinking about getting into
that line of work.

-Publishing?
-No, writing stories like you.

Bartending and the damp nights don't
seem to agree with me much anymore.

Looking to find something I can do
pretty much anywhere.

Like writing stories.

Yeah, well, good luck to you, Sammy.

Yeah, I was hoping
you could give me a few pointers.

And that magazine
with "The Little Dog Laughing" in it,

you wouldn't happen to have
a spare copy?

I'd sure like to read your story.

I know I got one in here somewhere.

Thank you, Arturo. It's a real honor.

Like I said, I was hoping you could
give me some pointers about writing.

If there's anything I can do for you,
you let me know.

Sounds like you've got something
in mind.

Well, thought you might like
a little advice about Camilla.

That's real white of you, Sammy,
but I think I can handle the situation.

Okey-dokey.

But you know what they say,
"Never a horse that couldn't be rode,

"never a cowboy
that couldn't be throwed."

And Camilla's one tough little pony.
She's got a real hard mouth on her.

"A real hard mouth."
Interesting turn of phrase.

You're too nice to that girl, Mr. Bandini.

-Too nice?
-Way too nice.

You don't understand Mexican women.

-Oh, Mexican women are different.
-No, sir.

They're like most women,
except more so.

You let up on them,
they're all gonna take advantage.

But you ease up on that little spic,

she gonna peg you
for a lily-livered gringo

and buck you out of the saddle
before you're in it.

A horse with a hard mouth
don't feel the bit, Arturo.

So, keep them on a tight rein,

never let them forget
who's boss for a second. No trick to it.

Ride them hard and it's easy.

Well, Sammy,
sounds like you know your horseflesh.

Yeah, I hope so, Arturo.

I'm gonna write Westerns.

By the way, <i>amigo,</i>

Camilla's one pony
who's worth the ride.

I'm glad to see you.

Why?

Okay.

Sammy told me
you were really nice to him.

I was beginning to think
you couldn't be nice to anyone.

-Can I get you something?
-Where is Sammy tonight?

-He left.
-Went home?

To the desert for a while.
He hasn't been feeling real good.

-What's the matter with him?
-Camilla.

TB, I think.

Here. You can start with this.

-Sammy has tuberculosis.
-Yeah. Tough break, huh?

We all gotta go.

What are you talking about?

-He won't live long.
-How dare you say something like that!

So how are all your other boyfriends?

I haven't got any other boyfriends!

Sure. Forgive an incautious remark.

Could I have the check?

No charge. It's on Sammy.

Bandini.

You don't have to pay
to be a smart aleck.

Besides, if it cost more than half a buck,
you couldn't afford to be one.

You're very funny.
Sammy writing your dialogue?

Why do you have to be so mean?

Mean? Me?

I'm anything but mean.

I'm a lover, my dear girl.
Equally fond of man and beast alike.

You can't be mean
and be a great writer.
