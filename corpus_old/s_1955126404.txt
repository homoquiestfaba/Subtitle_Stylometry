Translation: R1y!

1000 to 1

Based on a true story

What are the odds?
Our life is a part of a big puzzle?

Is everybody a little bit waiting
until someone makes us a whole?

Is life a series of
coincidences or is there more?

Hey, Cory.

You'd better quieter
doing, big guy.

You're breathing pretty heavy,
you get older and older.

I'll show you even old. Come on.
I'll make it this time easier.

That was no mistake.
Stop block.

Blocks? No, it was not a mistake.

every game you call it.

You know what blocks?
Each turnovers call you wrong game.

So what, you do not understand.

My game! Again?
No. I have to learn.

Learning takes place here.
-I Have to learn.

Teacher present?
Exactly, I see you.

Coach.
-Pops.

Hey, Coach.
Hey.

Beautiful, Weissman! Relax,
loose shoulders.

Once throw?

It's all in the knees.

What can I say?
those who can not go to the coach.

You're doing good boy. Good shot
and defense over the floor.

I disagree with you will not play
I say you do not observe.

There are three guests who will be graduating this year.
If you go

as you play now you have chance next
season start as <i> point guard </ i>.

Coach, I do not want anything
I've earned yourself.

You have a thousand points in your school career.
I think you've earned it all.

Bend your knees.

How is he, David?
Cory, good to see you.

I've heard you do great things.
I try anyway.

Two pieces Margherita
the sweetest girl in the school.

Thank you, Cory. Very kind.
You walked through that whole party,

For me, you're the best boyfriend ever.
Sorry. I'm just...

... Nervous for the presentation.

Fate or free will?
"Romeo and Juliet".

Seven to nine pages Monday
and I can not even get around.

If you have ideas ...

Romeo is the man, right?
Cute.

Maybe this
situation both ways.

As this year's team, with me.

You know I'm a competitive person?
A little.

That final year student, on my
start position. He's really good.

That is to say, that I for the first time
in my life, sitting on the couch.

I can through this fateful
event in the pit to sit down,

if I can use this motivation
to just work harder.

I know nothing about Romeo and Juliet,
but what I do know is ...

that's the way how you respond to something
is as important as what happens to you.

Wow. Cory which was
actually very helpful.

Thank you.

That was sweet.

My turn. I'm looking for more.
Sorry.

No, it's nothing.
With extra cheese? Or pepperoni.

The idea of â€‹â€‹an expanding universe
gives you the idea

that galaxies farther out
each float in space.

However, now it is believed that the
galaxies do not move

But that space there between
is increasing.

I see the facial expressions that
some of you are confused completely.

Our time is over. Do not be
worried, Thursday becomes clear.

Good. Good.

Good. Come on.

Do you want your tutu now or later? Lifting!

You would have me in a skirt
want to see is not.

Good job.
Thank you.

What's next?

You and Ally have plans?
We thought to go to Kristin tonight.

Perhaps following some bench press.

What do you think?

Of what?
From tonight, crazy.

Sorry. I think I
was daydreaming.

Are you okay?
Yes.

Sure.
I'm starting this afternoon, headache.

Why do you ask Kathy not an aspirin.
No it's OK.

Hey, I think this weight is taped.
What?

This weight seems stuck stuck.

What are you talking about?

You do not look so good, dude.

It's like someone me
with knives sticking in my head.

We're going to get some water.

Is everything alright?
Yeah, it's good, I ...

What's wrong with me, Pops?
I do not know. Let's go to Katie.

Lean on Me.

I got you.

We are almost there.
Coach! Katie!

What happened?
I do not know. We were on the train.

Put him on the bench.
Cory, can you tell me what's wrong?

Head hurts.

Can you squeeze my hand, Cory?

Okay now again
try it with your left hand.

Can you laugh at me?

Oh my.
Stay down. Everything will be fine.

This is from George Petrie
Gettysburg College.

We have an ambulance
required at the gym.

I think a student has a stroke.
What?

His name is Cory Weissman.
Can you tell me what day it is?

The left side does not respond.

It's good, right?
You did well.

What about his parents?

Bye dear. I'm jogging
and at half past five I have a client.

Mrs. Weissman, Brendan here.

Hey, Pops. Where is Cory?

Is everything okay?

We where the weightlifting
in the gym and ...

Hi, Mrs. Weissmann, Katie Whaley here.
I'm assistant sports coach at Gettysburg.

We do not know with certainty. But it looks
forward Cory had a stroke.

Where is he?

The ambulance just left
Hershey to the hospital.

FIRST AID

Thank you for coming coach.
What's going on, we see him?

He's room 206.
I'll get the doctor.

Hey, honey.
Hey, Mom.

Sorry.

It is subarachnoid hematoma caused by
an arterio-venous malformation in Cory's brains.

AVM, which is torn.

We have a medical background.

The large amount of blood from
the bleeding is the cause of the stroke.

And unfortunately this is still bleeding.

And you can not stop what
means that the brains are swollen.

We can not do anything until the
is stabilized by itself.

And if it does not by itself
stabilizes, then what?

The good news is that he is young
and has an excellent condition.

That's exactly what I tell my patients,
if their children have problems.

You have to be honest.

at present we can not
be sure that he survives the night.

Hey.
Hey.

What time is it?
It is late.

They have prepared a room,
where we can get some sleep.

He is in good hands.

I can see that he fights,
but he can not do this alone.

He needs us.

All I have to sit here 24 hours a day
and a whole week of sleep.

I am here when he wakes up.

Whatever happens, we stand
not allow this beats Cory.

What the...?

Come on!

What is happening?

Causing bleeding
more pressure on the brains.

We should give Mannitol.
What is Mannitol?

If he does not stabilize
we have to operate on him.

What about swelling?
Sorry, you'll have to wait outside.

Let's go. Give them some space
to work. Come on.

We do not operate. The danger
is not over, but the situation is better.

Cory. Can you hear me?

Vital signs look good.
We just have to wait and see.

We just have to wait and see.

Can you tell us where you are?

Hey, boy.
Hey.

Another change?
He's still unconscious.

Still no response.

Hey, big brother here.

What's up, dude?

Where have you been?

I brought lunch for Mom and Dad.

Do you have a chocolate milkshake
bring me?

What day is it?
Monday.

What is the name of your brother?
Jeremy.

Where are you going to study?

Harvard.

Stanford.

Gettysburg?

The whole team has
Signatures put.

Pops and Coach
have brought it.

You're in luck, so much
have friends who care about you.

Do I really have to such rehabilitation?

You have to go a long way, boy.

Can not I just practice at home?
It's only a month, more or less.

Depends on how fast you recovered.

Can you call the nurse for me?

Oh ... I'll do it.

What do you mean?
I'll help.

I helped grandpa always.
Shift your weight. To the left.

To the left?
The other left.

Sure, what you do?
I've got it. Let me...

Sorry. Are you okay?

You let me fall
the side that feels pain.

What happened?
Way to treat a stroke patient is not, anyway.

Yep.

Thank you.

What a fun.

How are you? Does it hurt?

From time to time. Sometimes it seems like I
a half-dead body dragging.

Not ... not look at me.

What?
As if you feel sorry for me.

I feel sorry for you.
Yes, but I'm going to beat this.

Clear? Come here.

That felt good.
At the right.

North Wright is one of the best
rehabilitation of the country.

We have advanced treatment methods,
care of patients with spinal cord injuries,

head injuries and strokes.

In the beginning, it's all what
overwhelming but you get used to it quickly.

Let's take a look at your room.

We make you wake up at 7:00 for breakfast.

Then you have six times a day therapy.

So we start tomorrow?
What do you mean "we"?

I studied physiotherapy.
Maybe, but ...

With all due respect, he might
your patient, but he is my son.

I motivated him 19 years
am not going to stop now.

By speaking no sense.
Yes, believe us.

This is a good center.
They will help us to overcome this.

I'm exhausted.

and I have some appointments in the morning, so ...

I'll be. There is still the
some things that I want to read.

Mother Bear.

Okay. I'm leaving early in the morning.
I'll see you tomorrow afternoon.

I love you.
Do not stay up late.

Come here. Show Dad how.
Okay, one more time.

Good. Go to the Basket.
Shoot!

Scorer!
Yes, Cory!

Hands wide.
Nice attitude, Cory.

Good. Block me.

In your face.
Yes, son.

That's my boy.

Push and pull back.

Pushing. Good.

You use your right arm,
but teaches the left arm.

This is the hardest,
thing I ever had to do.

Just like my brains and body
speak two different languages.

Good.

I have to learn everything all over again.

The hardest thing is my mind
clearly keeping all those medications.

Shift your weight
to your left foot.

But I will do everything required,
to play basketball again.

Although it sometimes seems
still going to last very long.

That's math for kindergarten.

Can you solve it?

This is just crazy.

Maybe if you try to concentrate ...
Maybe you should just do it.

Sorry.

I will do it.
It works well, thank you.

I hate it that you have to see me like this.

Cory

I do not care.
I do not even know what I'm doing here.

I do not believe in coincidence.
Everything happens for a reason.

What is the reason for that?

It just happened.
There is no reason.

You just ... bad luck.

Weight on the left.

Continue, continue to the end.

Come on, you can do this.
I do my best, Mom.

Only sometimes seems all this ...

I need a break.

Are you all right, Cory?
What is going on?

To the left, come on, put pressure.

Upright. And right.

How are you?
Well okay,

but I think we
against a wall walk.

Okay, in the wheelchair,
we go outside.

What do you mean?
Time for a little alternative therapy.

Mom, what are you doing?
This is stupid.

Since you could crawl want
you throw a basketball.

I do not want to throw,
because I can not.

You do not know.
Look, I really appreciate this.

But, you can take me back to
bring the hospital?

I never doubt your mother.

If you make it you get
me a chocolate milkshake.

I'm here now anyway.

Let's try it.

Do you have him?
Yes.

You can do it.

He's still there.
Double or nothing?

Good shot.
Camera running?

Let's see how you do it,
when someone stands in the way.

Beautiful.
Aim and follow.

Bend your knees.

There right.
All right!

This is therapy.

Get that kid away from me.
He is a zombie.

Where are you going?

Quickly before returning Sarah.
Oh my God.

Let's go to the cafeteria or so.

I believe that he himself
feeling better.

This is amazing.
Is that so?

Yes, look at the tension of that muscle.
Really good, Cory.

It comes back, unbelievable.
It's the wrong foot.

I am healed.
Look, everything works again!

Turn the camera but out.

I need brain surgery again
to completely remove the AVM.

But every time I turn
self-pity starting to get

I think of all those people who
have affected much worse.

Maybe I should not be so much
myself and think more of them.

Hello. Is this seat taken?

Please.

So if you like chess?

Yes, it is not Backgammon, but ...

I'm Cory.
Ed Welch.

Nice to meet you, Ed.

Why do not you start.
Charity?

Why are you here?

I had a stroke.

At your age? Is that legal?
I do not think so.

It happened during basketball practice.

Completely unexpected.

I also once played basketball,
When the pants were still short.

I played <i> guard </ i>.
I also, at Gettysburg College.

Who's turn is it?

I can not remember.
Me neither.

Brain damage is
life interesting.

Indeed.

This time you have to concentrate, Ed.

You start this time but.

After the surgery, I go five
times as hard to do my best.

I'm going to work to 500
shots to throw every day.

I know that.
No doubt about it.

Well, I ...

I'll see you when I wake up.

I love you.
I love you.

Please.
One medium citizen.

Thank you, Mr. Weissman.
There is more though.

You have a rap name required by the headscarf.
Cory's AVM.

What happens now?

This summer therapy
and then back to school.

And then I do my best to
to get back into the team.

The doctor said
is that really possible?

She did not say
that it would not be possible.

Besides, I get a special permit,
if I'm released from the hospital.

With a disabled parking permit.
Beautiful. Free parking.

What is that?
Amy Powers keeps her birthday in the new tent.

sounds fun. Do you want to go?
No I can not.

You go.
Okay.

Just go.
It sounds nice.

No do not bother.
Let's get some food.

Okay.

What are you looking at?

Is this really what you do all day?

Eating, sleeping and waiting
until someone comes home?

Is that all?

No secret things dogs
are up to when nobody is looking?

Guide your spy agency?

You slip into the liquor cabinet
when nobody is looking?

I feel that you can talk to.

So if you're not rehabilitating,
you hang around here all day?

You make it sound boring.
I mean, the mail comes,

Sometimes, the phone rings.

And when are you going to
Decreasing use drugs?

And then no more legal parties?
No, they can not do.

At least not yet.

-Who is it?
-Kylie.

They get together for a volleyball tournament.
Beautiful.

It seems fun.

Can you come?
No.

I can not go.
I need to rest.

I will not leave you here.

It does not matter.
I still need some time

to my baseball cards
alphabetical order to explain.

What, huh?

I'm kidding.

What is it?

I am so sorry.

I do not like someone.

What kind of person?

Someone who can not handle this.

Someone who is so selfish
and only thinks

how difficult it is to
To have a friend with a disability.

I wanna be the one
which is on your side

in prosperity and adversity
waiting for you.

By anyone who
admires for her sacrifice.

But I'm not.

As much as I would like it to be,
it's not me.

And thus...?

Get it?

Is that what you mean?

Who should I be?

The one who says, sure,
it does not matter?

No.
Do you have any idea what I've been through?

I have not done anything to deserve this.
I know.

I have to fight for everything.
Fighting for my strength.

Fighting for my memory,
Fighting for basketball.

And I'm going to win.
I'm going to win!

But my girlfriend can not even
few months to wait until I'm better.

Can not wait that long.
Is that fair?

That's not it.

And this does not deserve you.
I am so sorry.

Ha, dude.

Is everything OK?
I have to do this driving test.

Sure, if the therapist gives permission.
Actually, now.

If I were here longer alone
I'm in this house is crazy.

Slightly slower, ink
your license is still wet.

You may 45 here, I drive 35.
Do me a favor.

Remember how grandma drove slowly?
We were crazy.

You're doing the same.
I've actually been thinking a lot grandmother.

It was two years ago
and I still miss her every day.

I always wonder
if she's out there somewhere outside,

watches over us or anything.

I know what you mean.

Sometimes I swear
she sits next to me.

Even inside me.

When I had my stroke, I saw
no white light or anything, but ...

I could feel that she was with me.

Why are you here all along?
Here's less traffic.

I'm thinking
go back to school.

In the spring you can go to school.
Not in the spring, but within a few weeks.

Look how far I've progressed.

I can drive myself to school.
One step at a time.

I've already spoken with the dean.
The school supports me one hundred ...

Mom?
On the side.

On the side.
Mom.

You have a seizure.

Do not worry, honey.

It'll be fine.

You have a seizure.

Mom!
It'll be over.

It is well.

During the restoration of the second operation,
make new abnormal nerve connections

which can cause seizures.
As you experienced.

Will there be more?
Very probably.

Would anticonvulsant help?
Is there a drug-free way?

You need to stressful situations and large
amounts avoid sensory information.

Maybe, but not back to school.
I'm going back to school.

Is that a good idea?
I recommend to preliminary therapy to continue at home.

Since it is easier
in order to monitor the situation.

We can do everything
Spring reassess.

The final decision rests
However, you and your family.

ATO, here we come.
ATO.

Is that boy, <i> Sundance </ i>, still in school?
That's still there.

That boy is crazy.
I think I get more money from him.

Wait, Cory.
Let me help you.

It succeeds dad.
Thanks anyway.

Three and a half hours, Pops.
Hopefully you have some good music.

I think I own
all the way going to sing.

Was that it?
Yep.

Keep you strong, boy.
I will miss you.

Mam ...

Do not ... do not cry.

Easy for you
to say that.

Thanks to you, I have come this far.
You did.

Should you ever let me go, anyway.
If I fail, then ...

What then. Then I come back home.
You'll do it.

Thank you.

Thanks to you...

I love you.
Yes, I love you.

Pops! Off to school.

SECOND YEAR

Weissman, look at that.
You've still got it.

This is still nothing, coach.
Wait till I get back.

One step at a time.
That is recovering.

I mean, not rehabilitation.

I mean when I return to the team.
Cory, you know that I will always support.

I know it now
all a bit premature,

but I make a lot of progress.
I'll be back.

You know why I'm yours
so wanted to join the team?

Because of my good looks?

Because you are one of those players
which passes through walls as needed.

Watch how you handle your accident.
Many would have given up already.

But not you.
That's why I love you so, as a player,

and as a person.

If basketball was only going to perseverance,
there would be a shoe for you to be named.

But we both know that at this level,
Basketball is a heavy, physical and foul play.

If you have the resources to compete not have,
it does not matter how big your heart is.

I'm honest with you,
because I respect you as a man.

I know how much
you want to return.

I'd like you to come back.
Coach.

I scored a thousand points
in high school.

I'm going to my school not
finish with zero points.

Okay, maybe not this year.
But next year!

Coach.
I should be part of the team.

I will do whatever it takes.

We need someone to track
statistics and help exercises.

Yes, I will.

But I'm going to play again, coach.
Okay.

Here, Monday, 17:00.
Be on time.

All right, Coach.

And I'm going to score.

That kid ruined the whole party.

Yes, not normal.

Very funny. Very funny.
You guys are hilarious.

Let's start.
Two rows.

Are you going to fill the water bottles.

Show me what you got.

Touch the line!

Put that down time!
Okay, guys, pace!

Come on!

Touch the line!

Who's first?

Okay, water break.

Good job.
Nice pace, man.

I would do anything at this time,
to swap places with you.

Well done, man.
Good job.

What classes you follow?

Sociology, kinesiology
and linear algebra.

You're not kidding about the
do full selection.

I'm really excited.

Work hard or go home.
Pops wants to go home.

See you later.
See you later.

Class, I want you on the matter
the spiercelvezels understand.

Muscle cells consist of myofibril.

Each consists of myofibril
hundreds of sarcomeres

which lie one behind the other.

When the muscle contracts,
shrink the sarcomeres ...

... By the side of
the myosin hyphae.

Take the text that I gave you.

and then we take some notes on.

I'll make you into.
Please boy, computers let me win.

Let you win?
You throw only 80 percent, that's a problem.

You're the problem.
What?

Last week you badly in this game, now you play badly
and probably play again next week bad.

Okay. Want to tell me
What's bothering you?

Nothing.
Play now but.

So you're not telling me?

I must invent through
a list in the locker room?

You start as <i> point guard </ i>, dude.

That violent man.
Congratulations.

I did not know how you'd take it.

I am happy for you.

Do you need help?
No, I'm fine.

Cory! Is everything okay?

Oh my God.
Are you okay?

Is everything alright?
Let me help you.

I am fine!
Let me help you.

Sit down.

Sit down.

Guest
It's okay, dude.

I have only three times
cried in my entire life.

And the last eight months ...

I do not know what happens to me.

You were always better than me, Cory.

Pops ...
You do not say.

Oh yes,
because it's true.

That does not
I must be a jerk

thinking you my place
have taken on the team.

You're only human.

I mean...
It's all better, right?

Sure, man.
Eventually, it should anyway.

Have you ever considered,
to talk to someone?

The only time I ever such a thing
have been done during rehabilitation.

There was such a strange therapist there
thought I'd kill myself.

Was the only time that I was considering at
when that guy talked to me.

Should I talk about my childhood
or so?

I do not think we back
should go to your childhood.

What brought you here today?

I've had a stroke last year.
And I just started school again.

I was really excited.

I was glad I had my life again
could get back on track.

It is actually anyway
harder than I expected.

What?
According to the doctors, my brains

still not fully recovered,
so I get tired easily.

I can not learn.

I'm tense.
Really tense.

I can not ...

I never
been depressed.

So you think that the stroke
the cause of the depression?

It is said that therapists
just ask questions.

We are a curious people.
Everyone tells me,

I have too much hay
Take my fork.

I just want as quickly as possible
return to how it was.

Why the rush?
When I was 13, I broke my leg in football.

A guy tackled me from behind.
It was a complicated fracture.

It looked bad. The doctor said
that the recovery would last half a year.

and eight months,
before I could play again.

After four months I did
again join a tournament.

I set a goal,
and reached that goal.

What are your goals now?
Return on the basketball court.

So you want to be the same Cory
and before your stroke.

Yes.

And that will happen.

THIRD YEAR

Right there. You see?
That's going a lot better.

That feels good.
Unbelievable.

Excuse me.
Hi.

I'm Cory.
I am treated at my ankle.

Yes I can see that.
Does that mean I should not know your name?

I'm Jess.
Nice to meet you, Jess.

Are you new here?
I still have not seen.

I am a first-year student.

Welcome to Gettysburg.
Cory, this is not the time.

You should know that I
not trying to decorate though.

I am a third year student.
We must welcome the new welcome.

So it is rather my duty.

The school will appreciate your sacrifice.

That is certainly appreciated.
They call me a doer all here, right?

Among other things.

I have sprained my ankle.
And I hate it.

I can not move me well.
I know the feeling.

Believe me, it sucks.

How about yourself,
Mr. doer?

I also have a sore ankle.

It really hurts.
We have something in common.

Keep working on it.
I will.

It was nice to meet you.
Bye.

Just?
It does occasionally really hurt.

Really.

Listen!
Brand new year guys.

Last season has been!

The future is ours!

I think I my
speech should be revised.

Looks good, Cory.
500 shots per day ensures there.

Let's start then.
Form the rows.

Where are you going?

Water Bottle Filling
I told the team to form rows.

Come on!

If we continue
will be fine.

Yeah, you're Pop's size.

Try it.

No.

I wait until I really
may use in a game.

It looks good.

Yes definitely.

Hey Sundance? Well played today.
Thank you.

That was great?
How is the company?

Not bad.

The new girls will soon come.
Okay.

So you like basketball?

I'll be right back.

You know that we are the only student in the
campus that serves pizza at our parties?

That can not be true.
Really.

How are you?
Good.

How are you?
My ankle hurts a lot.

That's too bad.
I'm Cory.

I'm Jess.
Nice to meet you, Jess.

What year are you?
First.

Was that strange question?
Do you mean this?

Wait. What did I ...?

Jess! Hey Jess.

Wait a second.
I have offended you in any way?

We have another two days
ago met in the gym.

I remember.
Cool. Bye.

No, no, listen.

You do not understand, I forgot
because I had a stroke.

Okay. You are a
student with a stroke.

I mean I really had a stroke.

Damaged brain tissue and blood vessels
broke. Everything. The AVM was torn.

You should not joke about.
Pops!

Will you tell her about my brains.
That's a mush.

And my memory?
Disappeared.

And were you in the hospital?
Every day.

I'm still recovering.

It's pretty heroic,
if you think about it.

Oh, you two have been together ...

That's actually kinda cute,
He liked you so beautiful,

That he wanted to meet you twice.
Exactly

I first started in the third grade
to play high school.

Amazing and still in the team.
That is fantastic.

It was hard work but I
did not think I would find it so much.

I never thought of myself as a
Lacrosse seen playing athlete.

What did you do first?
What?

It is embarrassing.

Now you have to tell me.
I wanted to fight.

What? Pest?
Yes.

I hate bugs.
Yes, me too.

Does not mean that all my life
go spend to make them dead.

I'm mad that ankle.
Yes you are walking with a slight limp.

You look like me.

Are you cold?
Yes.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

I had a nice evening.

Yes, really nice evening.

Yeah, not bad.
Not bad?

I Was not entertaining enough?
No not at all.

Did not you have fun with me?
I had a lot of fun.

-Maybe I lied a little.
Maybe.

Now I have even more fun.

Yes, if you do not now
more recalls, after that?

I have a blackout.
I think I need more memory.

That felt good.
Yes.

Keith, change!

Back play, Nino.

Be careful now!

Look out, Tim!

Want me to get help?
No!

You do not want me to call someone?
No.

Okay, it'll be fine.
I'm here.

It's okay, all right.
I'm here.

His chances this season
play with less.

You think he's ready?

I know, if he does not play,
he collapses.

Cory. Come to my office.

This does work.

Hey.
Hey, coach.

I must tell you this season
have made a great impression on me.

First in training
and last to leave.

I know that you train as a
beast in your spare time.

I'll do whatever it takes, coach.

I also know how much you
want to join a game.

But that will not succeed.
What?

You're better, but you're not done yet.
I know you still have seizures.

I'm going to get no attack
during the game.

If it happens there ...
The risk is too great.

Coach.
I've earned this.

I know. Sorry.

And?

My whole life...

I thought everything
happens for a reason.

That's right, Cory.

It also happens for a reason.

I have in my entire life
never given up anything.

For the first time,
I consider it.

After everything you've been through,
why now?

I realized that I'm living in a dream.

I thought, if you work hard,
you can achieve anything.

As all these stupid tile
wisdoms on my wall.

Things happen in life. Some
people are good, some are not.

That's a stark view.

Think about it, Cory.

Two years ago you were paralyzed.

When you went back to school,

and inspired other people.

Nobody would by me
to be inspired.

If that is so, see
they are things that are not there.

So you're just a kid,
who can no longer play basketball.

With all due respect, this has
nothing to do with basketball.

I ...

I just want to be myself again.

Maybe that's the problem.
What?

You no longer Cory can be.
Really?

I do not really have a choice.

The old Cory is gone.
Sorry, what?

The old Cory is gone.
Sorry, I ...

The old Cory is gone!
He is dead!

Do you hear me?

He was buried.

That does not mean there
no new Cory can be.

That is ten times more,
Cory than ever.

<I> Cory, you do not know me. </ I>

<I> I heard the story of your
return on local radio. </ i>

<I> I hope you do not
mind that I write to you. </ i>

<I> Like you, my six-year-old
son also an athlete. </ i>
<I> He also has an AVM
and had a stroke. </ i>

<I> A portion of its left hand side
is still paralyzed </ i>

<I> and the doctors are not sure
how well he will recover. </ i>

<I> Evan is a fighter
and he does his best. </ i> "

<I> But, as you probably know,
some days are more difficult than others </ i>

<I> I told him about you, how you try again
to play and that motivated him tremendously. </ i>

<I> I understand you probably busy
you with your studies and basketball </ i>

<I> But if you ever have the time
to write Evan or even call </ i>

<I> that would mean a lot to him. </ I>

<I> Thank you for your time and I
hope I have not offended. </ i>

<I> Sincerely,
Jen Carlow. </ I>

Beautiful.

How are you, Pops?
Someone was absent from the exercises.

The team is not the same without you.
Yes I know.

They certainly miss their mascot.

I am serious.
The team respects you.

So you're coming back next year, right?
I do not know.

How long can someone
to sit on the bench?

Beautiful. Bring it on.
Really?

come on.
Really, guest?

Go.

You see?

That has nothing to do with your stroke
make, you could never left.

LAST YEAR

Thank you all for coming.
I do not know...

Can someone write this quickly.
It's his new Gettysburg Address.

I want to say something.

Cory, you know,
when you got your stroke,

that was the scariest
moment of my life.

I can not imagine
how it was for you.

I think nobody
that can be imagined.

But I do know that you are the strongest,
coolest guy are in this room.

And I want you to know
I'm always behind you.

I know Pops. Thank you.
No.

I could not help with the packing.
Really.

What is this?
I hope for you it's something beautiful.

At least one <i> monogram print </ i>.

Not really.

Guest.

Thank you, Pops.

This is the second best gift
that I have ever received from you.

Second, what is the first?
When you have saved my life, dude. Thank you.

I'd say you've got something I owe,
but some things can not be refunded.

I know.
I want to practice on Monday, what do you think of it.

That's what I meant.

Okay, <i> whatup </ i>
Let's party, come on!

That was good cut ...

Good work, guys!

Before you shower,

Hopefully we assist guests on
the right path for their new season.

Good! Good!

Hey, Pops.
Hey, coach. do you have a moment?

What's bugging you?
Cory.

Oh, me too. I spent three nights
not slept with him.

It's now or never.
He sat on the bench for two years.

Have you ever wondered
how it will end for him

if he gets injured or
attack gets for the home crowd?

I know it's a risk.
And then also the school's responsibility.

Yeah, but he's ...
-Pops.

I know that making the right decision.

Cory?
Got a minute?

Hey?
Hey, Mom.

I spoke with the coach
about tomorrow's game.

I stand at the base, Mom.

I stand at the base.

Cory?

Pops told me you were here.

So, how are you today?

I'm alright.
Beautiful.

How are you?
I was gonna call you when I heard the news.

but I did not dare.

I just wanted to congratulate you.

I know how hard you've worked for.
I'm proud of you.

Thank you.

Well, do your best.

Maybe more than that.

Ally. I want you to know that I understand
what happened between us.

You do not have to feel guilty about anything.
Everything is good.

Coach.
Do not count on your great victory.

That's why they play. Good luck.
You too

Cory. You know you
there must be off after the start.

I would have loved to.
Is there really no way?

I can not risk a shot?
No.

You can make him better.

Coach, I do not want anything
I've earned yourself.

Remember the knees, Cory.
Knees.

I scored a thousand points
in high school.

I will play again, coach.

I finish my school
not with zero points.

I'm going to score.

-Cory! Cory! Cory!
-Thank You, coach.

Thank you.

Well done, son.
Thanks, Dad.

Good.
Have you seen those last moments?

People say I have not changed,
but that is certainly so.

I am a new Cory now
and I'm glad.

I went to hell.

And I'm not going to someone
otherwise to leave there.

Although we can not always see it ...

... everything happens for a reason.
