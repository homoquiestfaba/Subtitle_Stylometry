Arsenio Hall!

Team Two take the prisomn.
We get thne villa.

Little Sister, this is Big Brothner,
we are in thne ballpark.

Big Brothner, Little Sister.
We're at the prisomn.

Little Sister, Big Brother.
Are you in position?

Big Brothner, Little Sister,
affirmative. Attack in 30.

Startimng now.

Six.. .

. ..five, four, three, two--

lt's amn ambush!

Ahka-Seltzer!

Big Brother!
Harbinger, where are you?

Surrender, Yankee infidels!
You have no chance.

Off to prison, American Satans.

Americans were shnocked
by the anmnouncement of thne failure.. .

. ..of yet amnother mission to
rescue hostages from thne Middle East.

lmnformed sources reveah thnat the
rescue team itself has been captured. ..

. ..amnd added to those
already being hnehd.

Reports also indicate that
an attempt on thne life.. .

. ..of a terrorist dictator
was thwarted at the same time.

With the election 10 days away, it
may be a setback for the White House.

Presidential challenger
Senator Gray Edwards.. .

. .. commented on the failed mission.

Thnis is no time for partisamn pohitics.

Brimngimng our peophe hnome
shnould be our priority.

Despite this crisis, the president
put on his best political face.. .

. .. continuing on
his campaign schedule.

Benson 's 20 point lead
in the poll six months ago. ..

. ..has plummeted since
the hostage crisis began.

The CNN/Victoria 's Secret
catalog poll.. .

. ..has the president
and Edwards running neck and neck.

Today, Benson made a brief stop
in Fergus Falls, Virginia.. .

. .. for the groundbreaking
of his presidential library.

The five living
former chief executives.. .

. ..Presidents Bush, Reagan,
Carter, Ford and Nixon.. .

. .. were on hand for
the groundbreaking ceremony.

Correspondent Jeri lKelter
reports on this historic moment.

Thne library is to be built near
the Fergus Falls Civic Center.

President Benson made no statements.

Pubhicly, he seemed umnaware of
the pohitical blow he hnad been deaht.

Privately, aides marveled at his spirit
as hne performed hnis mornimng routimne. ..

. ..by milkimng thne Whnite House goats.. .

. ..amnd eatimng two hnehpings
of grapefruit amnd creamed corn.

Tonight, the president and his top
advisers will burn the midnight oil.

Sabotage.

My God, mamn, what does it mean?

We must tighnten security, sir.
Fimnd out who's behimnd it.

No, mno, mno. The word ''sabotage.''
What does it mean?

Someomne's subvertimng our mission, sir.

One of our own may be
aidimng thne emnemy.

Come in!

Mr. President.

Oh, Jesus! Don't you ever sneak up

Okay, he is your hnusbamnd.

Topper, l was so young,

He used to come around

Evemn the restrainimng order my parents

He opemned my eyes to thne arts:

Would we get to the men in time?

And why did l bring helium
