In order to effect a timely halt
to deteriorating conditions

and to ensure the common good,

a state of emergency is declared
for these territories

by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett,

duly appointed representative
of his majesty the king.

By decree according to martial law,

the following statutes are
temporarily amended:

Right to assembly:

suspended.

Right to Habeas Corpus:

suspended.

Right to legal counsel:

suspended.

Right to verdict by a jury of peers:

suspended.

By decree, all persons found guilty
of piracy

Or aiding a person convicted of piracy

or associating with a person
convicted of piracy

shall be sentenced to hang
by the neck until death.

Lord Beckett!

They've started to sing, sir.

Finally.

A dangerous song to be singing.

For any who are ignorant of his meaning.

Particularly a woman.

Particularly a woman alone.

What makes you think she's alone?

You protect her?

And what makes you think I
 need protecting?

Your master's expecting us.

And an unexpected death would cast
a slight pall on our meeting.

aristotle

Have you heard anything from Will?

I trust young Turner to acquire the charts.

And you to remember your place in the
presence of Captain Sao Feng

Is he that terrifying?

He's much like myself, but absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair play.

Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?

Well, when you put it that way...

Remove...

...please.

Remove...

...please.

Captain Barbosa,

welcome to Singapore.

More steam.

None of that. If things don't go the
way we want.

then we are the only chance they've got

I understand that you have a request
to make of me.

More of a proposal to put thee.

I've a venture underway, and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

It's an odd coincidence...

Because you happen to have a
ship and a crew you don't need?

No.

Because earlier this day,
 not far from here,

a thief broke into my most revered
uncle's temple

and tried to make away
 with these.

The navigational charts.

The route to the farthest gate

Wouldn't it be amazing if this
venture of yours

took you to the world
 beyond this one?

It would strain credulity,
 at that.

This is the thief.

Is his face familiar to you?

Then I guess

he has no further need for it.

You come into my city

and you betray my hospitality.

Sao Feng, I assure you, I had no idea...

That he would get caught!

You intend to attempt a voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

But I cannot help but
 wonder.

why?

The song has been sung.

The time is upon us.

We must convene the brethren court

as one of the nine pirate lords.

You must honor the call.

More steam.

More steam!

There is a price on all our heads.

It is true.

And since the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore

is by betraying

other pirates...

It's the time to put our differences
aside. Wait for the signal!

The first step

Now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett

against East India Trading Company,

what value is the brethren court?

You can fight!

Get off me!

You are Sao Feng,
the Pirate Lord of Singapore.

My bold captain will sail free waters,
where waves aren't measured in feet...

Would you have that era come to an end
on your watch?

The most notorious pirates from
around the world

are uniting against our enemy,

and yet you sit here
cowering in your bathwater!

Elizabeth Swann.

There is more to you than
 meets the eye.

isn't there?

And the eye

does not go wanting.

But I cannot help
 but notice

you have failed to answer
 my question:

What is it you seek in
 Davy Jones' Locker?

Jack Sparrow.

He's one of the Pirate Lords.

The only reason

I would want Jack Sparrow return
from the land of the dead

is so I can send him back
 myself!

Jack Sparrow holds one of the
nine pieces of eight.

He failed to pass it along to a
successor before he died.

So we must go and get him back.

So

you admit

you have deceived me.

Weapons!

Sao Feng, I assure you, our
 intentions are strictly honorable.

Drop your weapons

or I kill the man!

Kill him. He's not our man.

If he's not with you and he's not with us...

who is he with?

take aim!

Set, fire!

Doublez! take aim

Set...

Fire!

It's an odd coincidence, isn't it?

The East India Trading Company finds 
me the day you show up in Singapore.

It is coincidence only.

If you want to make a deal 
with Beckett.

you need what I offer.

You crossed Barbosa.

You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

Why should I expect any better?

I need the Black Pearl to free my father.

You're helping me to get it.

Fire!

Thank you, Jack!

Thank you, Jack!

You have the charts?

And better yet.

A ship with a crew.

Where's Sao Feng?

He'll cover our escape and
meet us in Shipwreck Cove.

Hold it stiff into the wind!

There's no place left for Sao Feng to cower.

Do you think he will honor the call?

I cannot say.

There is an evil and disease

that even the most staunch and blood
thirsty pirates have come to fear.

A piece of eight.

Nine of them, you say?

Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

Nine pieces of eight.

What's the significance of that, I wonder?

Does it matter?

Nothing can hold against the Armada.
Not even the Flying Dutchman,I believe.

Nothing we know of.

Did your friend happen to mention
 where the Brethren Court are meeting?

He was mum on that, sir.

Then he knows the value of information.

Better keep this between ourselves.

We don't want anyone running off
to Singapore, do we?

Ah, Admiral.

You summoned me, Lord Beckett?

Yes. Something for you there.

Your new station deserves
 an old friend.

Not more requisition orders?

No sir.

Execution.

The Brethren know they face
 extinction.

All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

No one said anything about cold.

I'm sure there must be a good
reason for our suffering.

Why don't that obae woman just
bring Jack back,

the same way she brought back Barbosa?

Because Barbosa was only dead.

Jack Sparrow is taken in body and soul

to a place not of death

but punishment.

The worst fate a person can
bring upon himself.

Stretching on forever.

That's what awaits in Davy Jones' Locker.

I mean, that was a good reason.

Nothing here is said.

It is hardly as accurate as modern charts.
No.

But it leads to more places.

"OVER THE EDGE"

"OVER AGAIN"

"SUNRISE SETS FLASH OF GREEN"

Do you care to interpret,

Captain Barbosa?

Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

I reckon I've seen my fair share.

Happens on rare occasion,

at the last glimpse of sunset, 
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

Some claimed to have seen it
who ain't. And some say...

It signals when a soul comes
back to this world

from the dead.

Sorry.

Trust me, young master Turner,

it's not getting to the land of the
dead that's the problem.

It's getting back.

Back to her! Lift the sail!
Aye, aye, sir!

Bloody hell, there's nothing left.

Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

Fetch the chest.

And the Governour?

He's been asking questions about
 the heart.

Does he know?

Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

Steady, men.

Go.

All of you.

And take that infernal thing with you.

I will not have it on my ship!

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

Because I will.

Because it seems to me the only
way to ensure

that this ship do as directed
by the Company.

We need prisoners to interrogate,

which tends to work best
 when they're alive.

The Dutchman sails as its
 captain commands.

And its captain is to sail it as commanded!

I would have thought you'd learned that
when I had ordered you to kill your pet

This is no longer your world, Jones.

The immaterial

has become

immaterial.

Charge.
aim

How long will we continue not talking?

Once we rescue Jack,
everything will be fine.

Then we rescue Jack.

There is a cost must be paid
 in the end.

Barbosa!

Ahead!

Aye, we're good and lost now.

Lost?

For certain you have to be lost
to find a place as can't be found.

Elseways everyone would know
 where it was.

We're gaining speed!
Aye.

To stations!

All hands to stations!

stations

Haul the boat away

Never lay down!

Let her run straight and true.

Blimey!

We're doomed, that's all.

Don't be so unkind.

You may not survive to pass
 this way again.

And these are the last friendly
words you'll hear.

All to port!

my pieces

laggers, slack 'em braces!

Aye, Captain!

Slack 'em braces!

Step lively at the wheel

right away

fire down below

Help!
man the yars ye filthy toads!

seize handsomely boys

Aye, right away

Mr Sparrow?
Aye, captain.

What say you about the condition
of this tack-on?

It be proper to my eye, sir.

Proper?

It is neither proper nor suitable,sir,
it is not acceptable, nor adequate,

it is an obvious fact.

An abomination.

Begging your pardon, sir, but perhaps
if you gave a man another chance...

Shall I?

That sort of thinking got us
 into this mess.

We have lost speed, and therefore time.

Precious time,

which cannot be recovered once lost.

Do you understand?
Aye, aye, captain.

Do you now? It will all have to
 be redone.

All of it.

And let this serve as a lesson
to the lot of you.

Doldrum, sir,

has the entire crew on edge.

I have no sympathy for any
of you feculant maggots,

and no more patience to pretend
 otherwise.

Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.

No wind.

Of course there's no bloody wind!

My soul, I do swear for the place.

Gust, whisper,

tiny miniature lick!

Yes sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

We shall have a magnificent
 garden party,

and you're not invited,

A rock.

Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never heard that before.

Oh! A rope.

This truly is a godforsaken place.

I don't see Jack.

I don't see anyone.

He's here.

Davy Jones never once gave up
that what he took.

And does it matter?

We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

Witty Jack is closer than you think.

Impossible.

Slap me thrice 'n' hand me
to me momma- it's Jack!

It's the Captain!
like my sword

Jack!
Mr Gibbs?

Aye, captain!
I thought so.

I expect you're able to accoun
for your actions then.

Sir?

There has been a perpetual and virulent
 lack of discipline on my vessel why?

Why is that, sir?

Sir, you're you're in
Davy Jones' Locker, Captain.

I know that.

I know where I am. And don't 
think I don't.

Jack Sparrow.

Ah, Hector.It's been too long,
 hasn't it?

Aye. "Illy doo Mooahrtay", remember?

You shot me.

No I didn't.

Tia Dalma! Out and about, aye?

You add an agreeable sense of macabre
to any delirium.

He thinks we're a hallucination.

William, tell me something.

Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

or rather damsel in distress?

Either one.

No.

Well, then you wouldn't be here,
 would you.

So you can't be here.

Q.e.d.
 you're not really here.

Jack

This is real. We're here.

The locker, you say?
Aye.

We've come to rescue you.

have you now.

Very kind of you.

But it would seem that as I possess
a ship and you don't,

you're the ones in need of rescuing,

and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

I see my ship

right there.

Can't spot it.

Must be a tiny little thing, hiding
somewhere behind the Pearl.

Jack, Cutler Beckett has the
heart of Davy Jones.

He controls the Flying Dutchman.
He's taking over the seas!

The song has already been sung.

The Brethren Court is called.

Leave you people alone for just a minute
look whats happened, gone to pot!

Aye, Jack, the world needs
you back up here

And you need a crew.

Why should I sail with any of you?

Four of you have tried to kill me in
the past. One of you succeeded.

Oh! She's not told you!

You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

As for you

Now, don't tell me you didn't
enjoy it the other day.

Fair enough all right, you lady.

Don't need you. You scare me.

What gives, you can come. Marty.

Cotton!

some parrot
At least I'll have someone to talk to.

Who are you?
Tai Huang.

These are my men.

Where do your allegiances lie?
With the highest bidder.

I have a ship.

That makes you the highest bidder.

Good man.

away anchor. All hands,
prepare to make sail.

Which way are you going, Jack?

Trim that sail!Slack winglet braces!
Trim that sail!Slack winglet braces!

<i>What are you doing?
What are you doing?</i>

<i>No, what are you doing?</i>

<i>- What are you doing?</i>

The captain gives orders on the ship.

The captain of this ship is 
giving orders.

My ship, makes me captain.

They be my charts.

That makes you- chartman.

Stow away!

Don't move you! That's an order! Understand?

Sorry.

I just thought,with the captain issue,
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

Sorry.

I'd vote for you.
Yes.

You left Jack to the Kraken.

He's rescued now. It's done with.

Will, I had no choice.

You chose not to tell me.

I couldn't.

It wasn't your burden to bear.

Well, I did bear it, didn't I?

I just didn't know what it was.

I thought...

You thought I loved him.

If you make your choices alone,

how can I trust you?

You can't.

Eerie.

That's downright macabre.

I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them.

Be disrespectful, you would?

They should be in the care of
Davy Jones.

That was the duty 'im was
 charged with

by the goddess Calypso,

to ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

And every ten years,

'im could come ashore

to be with she 'o love 'im.

Truly.

But the man has become a monster.

So he wasn't always tentacly?

No...

'im was a man...

once.

Now there's boats coming.

They're not a threat to us.

Am I right?

We are nothing but ghosts to them.

We've better as just let them be.

It's my father! We've made it back!

Father! Father, I'm up here!

Elizabeth.

We're not back.

Father!

Elizabeth!

Are you dead?

No...

I think I am.

No, you can't be!

There was this chest,

you see.

I thought.

At the time it seemed so important.

Come on board!

And a heart.

I learnt that if you stab the heart,

yours must take its place,

and you will sail the seas for eternity.

The Dutchman must have a captain.

Silly thing to die for.

Someone cast a line!

Come back with us!

I told you, I'm destiny.

Take the line!

I was so proud of you, Elizabeth.

Hold on to the line!

She must not leave the ship!
Father!

Please come with us! Please don't leave me!

I'll give your love to your mother,
 shall I?

I won't let you go!
Elizabeth...

He made peace.

No wa'er. Why is all but the rum gone?

Rum's gone, too.

If we cannot escape these doldrums

before night,

I fear we will sail

on trackless seas,

doomed to roam between worlds forever.

With no water, forever looks to
be arriving a mite too soon.

Why doesn't he do something?

Me eye! Give it back!

There's no sense to it.

And the green flash happens at sunset.

Not sunrise.

"Over the edge. "

God, driving me over the blooming edge.

Sunrises don't set.

"UP IS DOWN"

Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.

Why are these things never clear?

Clear as mud, Jacky.
What?

Stab the heart. Don't stem the heart.

Come again?

The Dutchman must have a captain.

Well, that's even more than
less than unhelpful.

Sail the seas for eternity.

I love the sea.
What about port?

I prefer rum.

Rum's good.

Making port,

where we can get rum and salty wenches...

Once every ten years.

What did you say?

Once every ten years.

Ten years is a long time, mate.

Even longer, given the deficit of rum.

But eternity is longer still.

And how will you be spending it?

Dead? Or not?

The immortal Captain Sparrow.

Well, I'd love that.

Come sunset, it won't matter.

Not sunset.

"SUNDOWN AND RISE"

...up!

What's that?

What is that?

I don't know.

What do you think?

Where?

There.

What is it?

We're rocking the ship!

Aye, he's on to it!

He's rocking the ship!

We tie each other to the mast upside
down, so when the boat flips we will

be the right way up!

thats swell

Loose the cannons, you stinking mildrads!

Unstow the cargo!

Let it surf!

Now up...

is down.

Blessed sweet westerlies!

We're back!

There's the sunrise.

We need our pistols. Get untied, alright?

Alright then!

The Brethren Court has a gathering
at Shipwreck Cove,

and Jack, you and I are a-going,
and there'll be no arguing that point.

<i>I is arguing the point.</i>

If these pirates are gathering, I'm
pointing my ship the other way.

The pirates are gathering to fight
Beckett, and you're a pirate.

Fight or not, you're not running, Jack.

If we don't stand together, they'll 
hunt us down, till there be none left.

Quite like the sound of it.

Captain Jack Sparrow-

the last pirate.

Aye, and you'll be fighting Jones alone.

How does that figure into your plan?

I'm still working on that.

But I will not be going back to the
locker, nay.

Count on that.

Why, we can still use them as clubs!

Sorry.

Effective, though.

There's a freshwater spring on this island.

We can resupply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

I'm not leaving my ship in your 
command.

Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command?

Temporarily.

Criminy!

Odds bodkins!

Careful! Careful!

You stupid fish!
Actually, it's a cephalopod.

hope you're right. I bet
people will pay a shilling to see this.

And another shilling for a sketch
from seeing it drop.

then we will get some cracking slayers.

We could give us a slice as a souvenir.

Still thinking of running, Jack?

Think you can outrun the world?

You know, the problem

with being the last of anything-

by and by, there'll be none left at all.

Sometimes things come back, mate.

We're living proof, you and me.

Aye, but that's a gamble of luck
now, ain't it?

There's never a guarantee of coming back.

Passing on, that's dead certain.

Summoning the Brethren Court then,
 is it?

It's our only hope left.

That's a sad commentary
 in and of itself.

The world used to be a bigger place.

The world's still the same.

There's just less in it.

Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

Aye, I know him! He was in Singapore.

Singapore!

We got company!

He's the captain.

Sao Feng! You showing up here,

it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

Jack Sparrow.

You paid me great insult once.

That doesn't sound like me.

So we just call it square then?

Release her!

She's not part of the bargain.

And what bargain be that?

You heard Captain Turner?

Release her.

Captain Turner?- Aye, the perfidious
rotter lead a mutiny against us.

I need the Pearl to free my father.

That's the only reason I came on
this voyage.

Why didn't you tell me you were
planning this?

<i>That was my burden to bear.</i>

He needs the Pearl?
Captain Turner needs the Pearl?

And you felt guilty.

And you and your Brethren Court...

Did no one come to save me just
because they missed me?

I'm standing over there with him.

I'm sorry, Jack.

But there is an old friend
who wants to see you first.

I'm not certain I can survive any
more visits from old friends.

If you're so jealous to find out.

Curious.

Your friends appear to be quite
desperate, Jack.

they no longer believe that a gathering
of squabbling pirates can defeat

the Flying Dutchman,and
so despair leads to betrayal.

But you and I are no strangers 
to betrayal,

are we?

It's not here, Jack.

What? What isn't?

The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman,

and unavailable for you sir's leverage
to satisfy your debt to the captain.

By my reckoning, that account
has been settled.

By your death.

And yet here you are.

Close your eyes and pretend it's all a
bad dream. That's how I get by.

And if Davy Jones were to learn
of your survival?

be on your guard, men.

My men are crew enough.

Company ship, company crew.

He agreed. The Black Pearl was to be mine.

And so it was.

Perhaps you consider an
alternative arrangement.

One which requires absolutely
nothing from you

but information.

Regarding the Brethren Court no doubt.

In exchange for fair compensation.

Square my debt with Jones,

guarantee my freedom

Of course. It's just good business.

Were I in a divulgeatory mood,

what then might I divulge?

Everything.

Where are they meeting?

Who are the Pirate Lords?

What is the purpose of
the nine pieces of eight?

Beckett agreed. The Black Pearl
was to be mine.

Lord Beckett's not gonna give up only
ship as can outrun the Dutchman,is he?

Shame that you're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

Because honor's a hard thing
to come by nowadays.

There is no honor to remain here
with the losing side.

Leaving it for the winning side

is just good business.

The losing side, you say?

They have the Dutchman.

Now the Pearl!

And what do the Brethren have?

We have Calypso.

Calypso!

An old legend.

No.

The goddess herself, bound in
 human form.

Imagine all the power as you see is
brought to bear against our enemy.

I intend to release her,

but for that I need the Brethren Court.

All the Court.

Then keep Barbosa,

the belligerent homunculus and his
friend with the wooden eye, both,

and Turner.

Especially Turner.

The rest go with me aboard the Pearl,
and I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,

 I will hand you the pirates, and
you will not hand me to Jones.

Bloody fair deal, don't you think?

And what becomes of Miss Swann?

What interest is she to you?

What are you proposing, Captain?

What be accepted... Captain.

The girl.

Jack.

I've just recalled- I've got this
wonderful compass,

which points to whatever I want.

So for what do I need you?

Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

Out of the question.

It was not a question.

Point you to the thing you want most?
that is not the Brethren Court,is it?

Then what is, Jack?

Me.

Dead.

Done.

What?

Not done!

You got us into this mess.
If this is what frees us, then done!

Done.

Although if I kill you, then I can use
the compass to find Shipwreck Cove?

On my own.

Cut out the middleman, as it were.

Elizabeth, they are pirates!

I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

Then we have an accord?

With me killed, you'd arrive at the Cove

to find it's a stronghold nigh
 impregnable,

able to withstand blockade for years,

and then you'd be wishing,

"Oh, if only there were
someone I had not killed

inside, to ensure that the pirates
then come outside. "

And you can accomplish all this,
 can you?

You may kill me, but you may
never insult me.

Who am I?

I'm Captain Jack Sparrow!

By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove,and you will be free.

Calypso.

Excuse me?

Not a name you fancy, I'd imagine,
out of the many that you have.

But it is what we call you.

"We" being who?

You confirm it!

Confirm what?

You've told me nothing.
The Brethren Court, not I.

The first Brethren Court whose
decision I would have opposed.

They bound you to human form
so the rule of the seas

would belong to man and not...
To me.

But one such as you should never be
anything less than what you are.

Pretty speech from a captor.

But words whispered through prison
bars lose their charm.

Can I be blamed for my efforts?

All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

I offer simply my desire.

And in return?

I would have your gifts, should
you choose to give them.

And if I should choose

not?

Then I will take...

your fury!

Sao Feng?

Come here. Please.

With all nine pieces of eight,

you will be free.

Take it!

You are captain now.

Me?

Go on my place to Shipwreck Cove.

Forgive me, Calypso.

What did he tell you?

He made me captain.

You are not my captain.

Elizabeth!

James!

Your father will be overjoyed to know
you're safe.

My father's dead!

No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

Who among you do you name as captain?

Captain? Her.

Captain!
Tow the ship.

Put the prisoners in the brig.

The captain shall have my quarters.
Thank you, sir-

but I prefer to remain with my crew.

Elizabeth-

I swear- I did not know.

Know what?

Which side you chose?

Well, now you do.

You know my name?

Yes. I know your son.

Will Turner.

William!

He made it!

He's alive!

And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

Godswoons, he's on his way!

Yes, Will is alive.

And he wants to help you.

He can't help me.

He won't come.

But you're his father!

I know you.

He spoke of you.

He can't save me.

He can't come because of you.

Me?

You're Elizabeth.

Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

If Jones be slain, he who slays him
must take his place.

Captain forever.

The Dutchman must always have
 a captain.

And if he saves me,

he loses you.

You won't pick me.

I wouldn't pick me.

Tell him not to come.

Tell him to stay away.

Tell him it's too late.

I'm already a part of the ship.

And the crew.

Bootstrap.

You know my name!

You know my name!

Yes, I knew your son.

William?

He's coming for me.

Wait and see.

You'll see.

He promised.

Sir!

A breadcrumb trail,
and we are meant to follow.

A betrayer among them.

Or a trap.

A gambit by a skilled opponent.

Adjust course, Lieutenant.

Sir.

We can only hope to reach our
destination

before they run out of bodies.

You escaped the brig even
quicker than I expected.

William-

do you notice anything?

Rather,

do you notice something that is
not there to be noticed?

You haven't raised an alarm.

Odd, isn't it.

Not as odd as this.

Come up with this all by you alone,
 did you?

I said to myself: "Think like Jack".

This is what you've arrived at?

Leave Beckett the Shipwreck
Cove so as to gain his trust,

accomplish your own ends?

It's like you don't know me at all,
 mate.

And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

Ahh.

You've not seen fit to trust her
 with this.

I'm losing it, Jack.

Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

Mate, if you choose to love your heart
 away,you'll lose it for certain.

If I might lend a machete to your
intellectual thicket,

why, the choice is all to give up.

Changes effects.

Let someone else dispatch Jones.

Who?

You.

Death has a curious way of reshuffling
one's priorities.

I'll slip aboard the Dutchman,find the
heart, stab the beating thing

you're free to be with your charming
murderess.

And you're willing to cut out your heart
 and bind yourself to the Dutchman

Forever?

No, mate. I'm free forever.

Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map Free from death itself.

You'll have to do the job though, Jack.

You'll have to ferry souls
to the next world.

Or end up just like Jones.

I don't have the face for tentacles.

But a mortal has to care for 
something, aye?

What's this for?

A thing like me. It'll come to you.

My regards to Davy Jones!

I hate him!

Come with me.

Quickly!

Do not go to Shipwreck Cove.

Beckett knows of the meeting
of the Brethren.

I fear there may be a traitor
among them.

It's too late to own my forgiveness.

I had nothing to do with your father's
death.

That does not absolve me 
of my other sins.

Come with us.

James, come with me.

Who goes there?

Go!

I will follow.

You're lying.

Our destinies have been
entwined, Elizabeth

but never joined.

Go now!

Back to your station, sailor.

No one leaves the ship.

Stand down. That's an order.

That's an order?

Part of the crew, part of the ship.

Part of the crew, part of the ship.

Part of the crew, part of the ship!
Steady, man!

Part of the crew, part of the ship!
Who runs? Prisoner escapes!

Relay that!

James!
