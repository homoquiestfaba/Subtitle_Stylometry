<i>[Wolf Howling]</i>


<i>[Crowd Shouting]

Hey! There he goes.

After him!
Into the forest!

Aah!

<i>[Creaking]</i>



He's gone inside.
Let's burn it down!

[Shouting Continues]

Stop where you are.

What do you want here?
Go away!

Give us the monster!
He destroyed our village!

Monster? Ha!

Do you think I created some
monster from dead body parts...

I stole from the cemetery
or something?

<i> [Crowd Grumbling]

We just thought
that maybe-â€”

Ridiculous!
Now, shoo. Shoo!

[Crowd Grumbling,
Complaining]

Hmph.

<i>[Monster Growling]</i>

<i>Now you've done it!</i>

They will be
watching us!

Now we must leave this place
and start all over.

And you know
what that means.

<i>[Frightened Growling]</i>

<i>[Squeaking]</i>

<i>[Frantic Muttering]
Yow! [Splattering]</i>

me. I have a spare.

<i>[Wolf Howling]</i>


[Roaring]
[Screaming]

[Roaring Continues]


Sorry.
It's my arch supports.

They throw off my whole
center of balance.

You call this a monster?
Come on, Billy.

I told you
this wouldn't be scary.

Let's go on that Dragonland
ride again. [Blows Raspberry]

Those gigantic, fire-breathing
serpents always make you wet your pants.

Oop! [Chuckles] ls
everything all right?

Not too scary, was it?
Are you kidding?

We were more
frightened... [Raspberry]

by "It's a Teeny-Weeny
World."

Sorry, Mr. Yesman. Look, I
know I goofed up, but I'll do better.

You pose no professional
threat to me, so I'll be frank.

This was
your last goof-up!

But, sir, I--
Face it!

You're just not scary. Majestic Movie
Studio Park has a reputation to uphold.

Besides, my job is on the
line. Give me your head.

Yow!
Watch the electrodes.

I'm bringing in a monster
expert from Europe.

He's going to make this
attraction the terrifying experience...

our public
expects it to be.

Yeah, but wh-what about
me? I don't have insurance!

You're going back to your old job.
No [ Stammering]

Not... Sammy Squirrel!

America's wackiest
cartoon rodent.

[Yelling]
[Crying]

Sorry about that.

How dare you scare
my child? [Crying]

What kind of a park are you
running here? [Whimpering]

Oh, did "wittle Biwwy Wiwwy"
get scaredy-poo?

[Blows Raspberry]
Gosh, Alvin. A-Are you okay?

Y-Yeah. I think so. [Gasps]

Where's my Cap?

What happened, Alvin?
Trip over your ego?


I bet Alvin would feel better
I-if I had something to eat.

Why don't we find
a snack bar?

Hello? A snack
bar? Are you kidding?

We've got a whole
hour to kill...

at the thrill-ride capital
of the universe,

and you want to go
to a snack bar?

<i>Absolutely not.</i>

Th-This kills me to say it,
but Alvin's right.

<i>There's the 3-D show,</i>

<i>the special effects lab...</i>

<i>and the fabulously-</i>
Oh, please, Simon.

We're going
to Dragonland!

<i>[Woman] Hey, watch it!
[Woman #2] Hello, I'm sitting here!</i>

<i>[Theodore] I don't want to
go to Dragonland! It's scary!</i>

<i>No, no, no, no, no.
Not scary. Thrilling!</i>

<i>Take 'er up!</i>

Easy now.
Up!

<i>Herr Yesman?</i>

Eeh! Oh, you must be
Doctor F-F--
-That is right.

Ted Yesman. Accent
on the first syllable.

Welcome to Majestic,
Doctor!

Thanks for coming to save
my job-- I mean, the studio.

Sure.

Here, here. Let
me get that for you.

When I want your help,
I will ask for it.

â™ª Sammy, Sammy, Sammy
I'm a squirrel squirrel, squirrel â™ª

<i>Yuck!</i>
â™ª The smartest little rodent
In the world, world, world â™ª

â™ª I can do anything-- â™ªâ™ª

Stay away from me, you
irritating, singing vermin.

I never liked you,
even as a small child.

[Uneasy Chuckling] I can
see you're a decisive man.

A man who knows what he wants.
-Take me to the castle now.

Right away.
Absolutely! Posthaste!

Lovely bag! Must have
cost an arm and a leg.

Actually, an arm
and <i>two</i> legs.

<i>But I hate roller coasters!</i>

Well, Dragonland's
not a roller coaster.

-Oh! Really?
-Really.

A roller coaster just goes
up and down and around.

Dragonland does
all of that, plus...

it surrounds you with
incredibly realistic...

<i>fire-breathing,
mythical monsters...</i>

<i>with yard-long,
razor-sharp teeth,</i>

and claws-- Mm-mm-mm!
-Silence, my little friend.

<i>You're scaring
Theodore to death.</i>

Theodore. Are you okay?

Nothing a little snack
couldn't cure.

<i>Dragonland's the best!
Wow! I'm goin' again!</i>

Yeah. Me too. I still
got hearing in one ear.

No!

Oh, quit fighting, pal. You're
gonna love this. Trust me!


Open up. Open up!

Silence!

Can't you read English?
It's closed!
[Screaming]

Go on! Get! Shoo! Before I
turn you into luncheon meat!


Whoa-ohh-ohhh!

Uh, Herr Doctor,

don't take this as a criticism,
but this is a tourist attraction.

We usually try not
to threaten the guests.

<i>Und</i> "have a nice day."

That's the spirit!

I want you
to go away now.

[Giggling Nervously] Not
a problem. I can do that.

Consider me gone!

<i>[Rumbling] [Man]
Delivery for the doctor.</i>

Please.
This way.

<i>Und</i> be careful.

<i>[Alvin]
Hey, let's take the tram.</i>

<i>[Man Groaning]</i>
Hey! Watch it!

Sorry. Excuse me.

[Theodore Grunting]
Ah! Mm. Ow!

Dragonland,
here we come!

<i>[Coughing On P.A., Loudspeaker Squealing]
[Man On P.A.] Are we on?</i>

Hi!
Welcome to the Majestic
Movie Studio Tour,

<i>where fun and fantasy
and folks like you...</i>

<i>find fabulous
filmland fulfillment...</i>

with your new friend, Phil--
that's me!

Now, get your cameras ready,

'cause we just might see
some celebrities today!

Would you like that?
[Together] Yes!

That's "Yes, Phil!"

[Together] Yes, Phil.
Now, before we get going,

is anybody here
a producer?

Hmm?
Ahh.

Mm-hmm.
Not even for cable?

Well, okay.

You know, folks,
here in our little corner
of the Hollywood dream factory,

<i>we shoot over 500 hours
of TV shows and movies
in a year.</i>

And yet, incredibly
<i>talented</i> actors are reduced
to driving bus loads...

of ungrateful <i>vacationeers</i>
on studio tours--

<i>Uh--
[ Coughs, Chuckles]
Well, then--</i>

Now, here's where they shot that unforgettable
scene in <i>High Society Lowlifes...</i>

where Sir Arthur tells
Natasha he's leaving her!

Oh!
It's one of my favorites!

"I'm not the man
you want, Natasha.

I'll only make you...
miserable."

<i>[Tourists Grumbling]</i>

Uh, Phil, if I may--
Hey!

"I'm not the man
you want, Natasha.

"I'll only make you...
miserable.

<i>You want someone who wants
to settle down and start a family."</i>

"Don't tell me
what I want, Arthur.

"You're the only man
I've ever loved.

<i>[Tourists] Aww!</i>
Will <i>ever love."</i>

where the sister comes in.

"Natasha! Natasha!
Daddy's gone!"

"No!"

<i>[Clapping, Cheering]</i>

Listen, you little... beaver,
or muskrat or whatever you are--

Don't... touch...
the cap.

Oh!
You think you can do
this job better than me?

Duh.
<i>[Tires Squealing]</i>

[Phil Screaming]
Whoa-ho!


Whoa!

Aah!

<i>[Phil Screaming]</i>

Alvin, these people
are paying for a tour!

<i>At least give them one!</i>

No time, Simon. I'm
getting us to Dragonland.

Remember, Miranda, you think you
just married the man of your dreams,

<i>only to discover it was
his evil twin brother...</i>

<i>Who doesn't know that you're
his brother's fiance's twin sister.</i>

Action!
<i>[Tires Screeching]</i>

To your left is
the New York street...

<i>where they shot</i>
Guys and-- <i>duh!


<i>To your left is
a screaming bridesmaid.</i>

To your right is
the mother of the groom.

<i>You're driving right crazy.</i>

Straight ahead, that's international
star Miranda Burstynpfeiffer.

Gee, she sure can jump.

Who wants to go again?

[Crowd Cheering] Me! I will! I will!
Give me that key, m-maggot!

<i>[Crowd] Aww!</i>
Much better.

But you might want to put
the emphasis on "maggot."

[Shouting Good-byes]

have to walk to Dragonland.

to rain on your parade,

but our show?

We've got plenty of time.
I know a shortcut. Trust me.

I hate it
when he says that.

But they were due back
a half-hour ago!

I could lose my job over this.

<i>[Dave] Gee, Mr. Yesman, I-I'm really
sorry. I can't imagine where they could be.</i>

Well, of course they want to
perform at the world premiere.

I know you've got
a very hard job.

No, I-I'm sure your mother
would be disappointed if you lost it.

Mr. Yesman.
M-M-Mr.Yesman!

I assure you that the
Chipmunks are professionals.

It's not like them
to be late.

Who am I kidding? "Late"
is Alvin's middle name.

I better get to the theme park
and see if I can find them.

<i>[Man On P.A.] Ladles and gentlemen,
thank you for visiting me, Sammy Squirrel,</i>

<i>at Majestic Movie Studio's
park.</i>

<i>Come again soon.</i>

<i>Hmm. Mm. Yeah.</i>

<i>Arms, two.
Legs, two.</i>

Feet-- one!

Now, where did I put that--
<i>[Growling]</i>

Herr Doctor?
What now?

Oh, my goodness.

You've accomplished
quite a bit for one afternoon!

I do not like to waste time.
And, uh, what are these?

Brains.
[Laughing]

Uh, how--
how realistic.

Yes.
They are.

What size shoe
do you wear?

you don't want-- I mean--

My right foot's
so much larger than my--

I had to special order all
my-- W-Well, good night!

<i>[Footsteps Receding]</i>
Ah! Never mind.

Here it is.

Great shortcut, Alvin.

We've been walking
for hours,

and I've yet to see
a single dragon.

Yeah,
and I'm still hungry.


Our show's
been canceled.

What do you suggest
we do now,

Mr. Reliable?

Okay, okay, I admit it.

We missed our show,
the park is closed,

we're probably locked in,
and it's all my fault!

There.
Are you happy?

I'm just
fuzzy all over.

stay here all night!

Teddy will get cold.

Don't worry, Theodore.
So we're locked in overnight.

worst that can happen?

<i>[Growling]</i>

Well, I guess we could
starve to death.

Or lions could escape
from their cages...

and tear us
limb from limb!

<i>Or maybe the ghost of
some silent movie star...</i>

<i>could wrap his cold,
green, lifeless hands...</i>

around our
little throats and--

Or we find a phone, call
Dave and have him pick us up.

I-I pick Simon's plan.
Oh, wait for me!

don't I get to dial?

Because it's my quarter,

<i>and Theodore
asked first!</i>

Oh!

Don't worry, Theodore.

As soon as Dave answers,
our troubles are over!

[Line Ringing]
It's ringing!

Oh, please answer,
please answer, please answer!

Theodore!
Simon!

Alvin!

He's not home.

[Gasps, Shrieks]
We're all gonna die!

[ Screaming,
Grunting]

Hey, look!

<i>Sornebody's still here,
[Wolf Howling]</i>

As soon as
I know they're okay,

I'm gonna kill them!

[Grunting,
Mumbling]

Alvin!

Alvin! Cut it out.

You know it scares me.
[Sinister Chuckling] I know.

<i>[Muttering, indistinct]</i>
Shh! Hear that?

<i>[Muttering Continues]</i>

<i>[Dr. Frankenstein] â™ª The knee
bone's connected to the leg bone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The leg bone's connected
to the f- â™ª</i>

To this-- How does
that song go again?

â™ª Them bones, them bones
Them-- Mm-hmm â™ª

<i>â™ª Hey, da-da â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey, da-da â™ª </i>
No!

<i>â™ª Da-ding-ding an ankle â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Da-ding-ding the foot
Da-ding-ding the toe â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Da-ding-ding â™ª</i>

[Singsong Continues, Indistinct]
<i>[Gears clanking]</i>

[Theodore, Alvin Gasp]
Guys, it's just a costumed character.

It's not real!

Ah, <i>mein liebchen!</i>

At last we are together again.

This fool Yesman,

hiring the <i>real</i>
Dr. Frankenstein...

to make his little exhibit
more frightening! [Giggles]

I think we will make it
frightening enough.

Don't you?

<i>Alvin!</i>

Fellas!

[Electricity Buzzing]



<i>[Dr. Frankenstein Cackling]</i>

My fame is alive!

[Cackling Madly]
[Swooning]

<i>[Thuds]</i>
Theo? [Swoons]

<i>[Thuds]</i>
[Laughing Hysterically]

<i>Hey!
Don't touch the cap.</i>

[Screaming, Cackling]
[Screaming]

[Grunting]
Let's get out of here!

They must not escape!

Hurry! Hurry!

Before they bring
the others!


Guys?

Maybe they got locked
in their dressing room.

A-A-Alvin?
Simon?

[Screaming Hysterically]




Oh! My Teddy!

[Growling]
[Gasping]

Theodore, let's go!
<i>[Growling]</i>

Where could they--
<i>[Wolf Howling]</i>

Hey! Someone
must still be here.

<i>[Growling Continues]</i>

I-Is he g-g-gone?

I think so.
<i>[Growling]</i>

[Nervous Chuckling]
But I could be wrong!

[Both Screaming]
[Grunting]


â™ª Sammy, Sammy
I'm a squirrel
squirrel, squirrel â™ª

<i>â™ª The smartest little rodent
in the world, world, world</i>

â™ª I can do anything-- â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª [Stops]
[Alvin Screaming]

Why are we stopping,
when every rational impulse...

tells us to--
Oh, no.

Dragonland.

Alvin?
Theodore?

Si-- Aaaah!
Well, what do you want?

I-I'm looking for
three little chipm-

Come in. Come in!

Tell me, are you
an organ donor?

You can't be serious.

Simon, don't you see?

Even a monster wouldn't
think we were stupid enough...

to take a thrill ride in the
middle of a life-or-death chase!

Are we?
Well, yeah.

But he doesn't know that.
Come on!


This is too creepy.

I gotta get out of here.

May I remind you that...

there's an actual
monster back there!

Oh, yeah.
I-I forgot.


This is so cool!

I'm not happy.

Hey, look!
A phone.

Maybe Dave's
home by now.

He could bring the cops
and save us! [Beeping]

No, Alvin! Wait!
That's not a ph--

<i>[Alvin On P.A.] Dave! You gotta
come get us. There's a monster after us.</i>

<i>And we're hiding
in Dragonland!</i>

Huh?


for the hiding concept.

Well, maybe the monster
doesn't understand English.

Boy, that little
glass of yours...

is always half full,
isn't it?

What little glass?

<i>[Growling]</i>

[Screaming]
[Monster Growling]

[Electricity Crackling]


Yes!
He missed!


<i>[Dr. Frankenstein]</i> Und <i>add
one ounce of sleeping potion--</i>

Ah! Here, here!
The tea is ready.

I'm really worried
about them.

I understand. Ach! I have
a little monster of mine own.

[Cackling]
I've looked everywhere.

Calm yourself.
Relax.

Drink your tea.

I-I can't relax. Not until I
know the boys are okay.

I am sure
they are fine.

They probably just
found a little playmate.

I-I gotta go.

They're out there
in the park <i>somewhere.</i>

Wait! I, uh, have
a map of the place.

This will help.

By the way, do you
have both your kidneys?

<i>[Theodore] This isn't
real. It's just a ride.</i>

This isn't real.
It's just a ride.

<i>This isn't real!
It's just a ride!</i>

<i>[Theodore Screaming]</i>

[Screaming Together]
[Monster Screaming]

Tell me you don't
love this baby.

Quite impressive.
<i>[Growling]</i>

But I don't think we're
going to like the way it ends.

Oh! He really
shouldn't be doing that.

You're supposed
to sit down...

and keep your hands
in the car at all times!

Very helpful,
Theodore.

We wouldn't want him
to get hurt...

before
he could kill us!

<i>[Wheels Screeching]</i>

[Alvin Continues] Hang on, guys.
This is supposed to be the scariest part.

<i>[Monster Growls] Unless, of course,
you have a hideous monster chasing you.</i>

[Monster Growling]

[Screaming]
[Screaming]

Oh. I think
I lost my appetite.

<i>[Growling]</i>

<i>Doesn't he know it's just a-a ride?

<i>He thinks he's
about to be eaten!</i>

[Screeching]
[Growling, Grunting]

Man!
He's like cough syrup.

He just
won't go down.

<i>[Dave] Gee, I-I didn't
realize how big the park is.</i>

Thanks for
your hospitality,

but I-I really
better be going.

You haven't... touched
your tea. [Chuckles]

Perhaps something to
make you sleep.
No, thanks.

[Blows]
I-I'm gonna check at home.

<i>Maybe they're
already back there.</i>

Very well.
Thanks again.

Come again!
[Dart Sticks]

<i>Und</i> bring your kidneys--
Kiddies. I mean your kiddies.





Oh, this isn't good.

The potential energy
is building up...

far beyond
the tolerances...

for which this ride
was engineered.

What does that mean
in English?

I means unless he lets go
something's going to give,

<i>and we're going
to go way too... fast!</i>



Wow!

Ah!
We made it!

We're alive!

I told you to trust me.
Oh, please!



<i>[Dave] Uh, Theodore's always
been so happy and sweet.</i>

<i>Simon's the one
with the glasses.</i>

<i>[Chuckles] Funny, I didn't
even know he needed them.</i>

<i>A-And then of course,
there's Alvin. [Chuckles]</i>

Oh, this was the time Alvin
burned down the kitchen...

making me
a Father's Day breakfast.

<i>[Female Officer] Oh, y-yeah, I remember
getting the call on that one.</i>

Oh, and here he is, just after he set the
lab rats free at the school open house.

There <i>I</i> am.

The one with the principal's
hands around your neck? Uh-huh.

She's got quite a grip
for a woman her age.

Well, Mr. Seville,
we'll be in touch.

<i>You betcha. And don't
worry, we'll do our best...</i>

to find your,
uh, ah, "boys."

Do you need any more information?
Did I describe them okay?

"Chipmunks with clothes on."
Yeah, that ought to do it.

As soon as we hear
anything, we'll let you know--

Dave!
Fellas!

Oh!
Ah, that's gotta hurt.

<i>[Dave]
Thanks, officers.</i>

<i>Uh, Dave? Dave?
I-I can't breathe.</i>

Oh, sorry. Now--
We know, Dave.

"Everybody on the couch."

Where on Earth
have you boys been?

Well, we--
Why didn't you call?

We tried!
Didn't you stop to think
how worried I must have been?

Yeah, but we--
Missed your show
and disappeared for hours!

But Dave, you don't understand.
There was this huge, scary monster, see?

And every--
Yeah, I know.
And it ate your homework.

Huh?
Uh, what homework?

Good one, Dave.
But really, it was all--
Alvin, please.

I'm not in the mood
to hear about monsters.

<i>Now, until you're ready
to tell the truth,</i>

I don't want to hear
a peep out of any of you.

But--
[Clears Throat]

Good night.

I can't believe it.
Dave didn't believe me.

Yeah. Especially with your
track record for honesty.

Can I help it if I don't stifle
my active imagination?

My Teddy!

I-I must
have dropped him.

Well, we're not
going back for him.

But, if we did,

that monster wouldn't
stand a chance!

Oh, wow!
I'm still scared.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª What if a monster came
in the room tonight â™ª

<i>â™ª What would we do
What could we do â™ª</i>

â™ª If he tried to make your hair
turn white with fright â™ª

â™ª What would you do
if it was you â™ª

â™ª I'd drown him
with my soaker gun
Glue him to a chair â™ª

â™ª Stick a dead skunk
in his pockets â™ª

<i>â™ª I'd knock him off his feet
with a judo sweep â™ª</i>

â™ª Blast him into space
on a rocket â™ª

<i>â™ª I'd send him to his doom â™ª</i>

â™ª If a monster
came in my room â™ª

Yo, zipper-face,
you want a piece of me?

Y'all ready to rumble?

Bring it on, brother!

â™ª But if a monster sat
on the edge of the bed
what would you do â™ª

â™ª What could you do â™ª

â™ª With a zipper in his neck
And bolts in his head â™ª

â™ª If it was me
Well, let me see â™ª

<i>â™ª I'd multiply pi
times his height
and his weight â™ª</i>

â™ª To determine mathematically â™ª

<i>â™ª The way to alter
his molecular state â™ª</i>

â™ª Uh-uh, no way â™ª

â™ª We'll chase his face

â™ª That's what we say â™ª

â™ª Ain't no monster

â™ª Uh-huh, that's right â™ª

â™ª 'Cause we're
the meanest 'munks around â™ª

â™ª We're tight â™ª

Simon! Theodore!
Alvin!

Go to sleep!

Okay!

I am the Munkinator.

â™ª If a monster came in
and decided to stay â™ª

â™ª That wouldn't be very nice â™ª

â™ª We could ask him politely
to go away â™ª

â™ª Are we 'munks

â™ª I'll stick him in the ribs

â™ª Shoot Silly String

â™ª I'll use my blanket

â™ª I'll just hide under my bed â™ª
[Simon, Alvin] No!

<i>[Together]
â™ª We'll make

Oh, I hope Teddy's

[Leaves Rustling]


<i>[Growling]</i>

<i>[Dave]
Alvin! Go to sleep!</i>

[Growls, Yells]

<i>[Thud]</i>

<i>Come on, fellas.
I thought I told you to--</i>

Huh?

<i>[Door Shuts]</i>

<i>[Theodore Gasps]
Teddy!</i>



<i>[Thunderclap]</i>

What do you want?

Oh, Teddy!
You're okay.

Y-Y-You came
all this way...

just to give him
back to me?

[Gentle Growling]

[Grunting,
Groaning]

Wait!
Huh?

You shouldn't be out
in this rain.

You could catch a cold.

Come on.
Friend.

Aww.

My <i>liebchen!</i>
Where are you? Hello?

Where could he be?
Hmph!


Ah!
 <i> [Thunderclap]</i>

Oh! Oh-ho.

Such a headache!


Out of my way, imbecile!

You miserable rodent!
I can't stand you.

You don't even
look like a squirrel.

Your silly hat, and--

I hate you,
and what's more, I--

â™ªâ™ª [Sammy's Theme]
Oh, I hate that song.

<i>â™ªâ™ª [Continues]</i>

Yecch.

<i>[Deep Snoring]</i>

Theodore,
you're snoring again.

<i>[Snoring increases]</i>

Theodore, cut it out!

[Deep Snoring
Continues]

Oh, Simon?

Uh, what?

Take a peek
under Theodore's covers.

What?
Just do it.


[Snoring Continues]

Well,
what do you see?

You mean, the--
ahem-- monster?
Mm-hmm.

But how?
How did he--

I don't know, but we've
got to save Theodore.

back the covers, and I'll--

Huh?

Wait! Don't hurt him.
He's a good guy.

Well, of course he is.

We just wanted to know if
you guys wanted to play...

uh, baseball.

Well, uh, maybe
after breakfast.

<i>[Dave] Fellas!</i>
[Both Gasping]

Guys, I gotta go.
Hey!

Uh, I'm gonna try and get
you that big premiere again.

And don't go anywhere!

<i>Miss Miller
will be here any minute.</i>

Whew!

<i>[Door Opening,
Closing]</i>

<i>[Car Door Closing,
Engine Starting]</i>

<i>[Car Driving Away]</i>

Ohh.

I don't get it.

If he's such
a big, lovable lug,

then why was he trying
to kill us?

Perhaps he wasn't
trying to kill us.

Hello!

If he'd caught us last night, he'd
have cracked our little bodies...

like this!

Uh-oh.

Actually,
I-I think Alvin's right.

Well, then may I ask why we're
fixing him a 12-egg omelet?

Well, 'cause I think
he's got a really nice heart.

He probably just acts like a monster
'cause everyone treats him like one.

Uh-oh.

[Glass Tinkling]

Oh.

<i>[Woman]
Hello!</i>

Yoo-hoo! Hello!
Boys!


[All Gasp]
Miss Miller!

Well, Miss Miller!
So good to see you!

[Simon, Theodore Grunting]
But Dave decided to stay home 
today with his kiddies.

What?

Why, I turned down a lunch date
with my vacuum repairman.

Now, listen here, David.

If you wanna stay home and
play "monster" with your boys,

then I expect
a phone call.

Shame on you, David.
Huh?

Don't you give me
an attitude, young man.


Ohh!
What's burnin'?

Well, thanks for
stopping by, Miss Miller.

Ta-ta! And sorry you
can't stay for breakfast!

Oh, was that close.


<i>[Alvin] Breakfast!</i>

Ohh! 
<i>Oh, it's okay.</i>

Accidents happen.

Anyone who's ever broken
something, raise your hand.

Huh? 
[Simon, Theadore] Alvin!

I can't say
that I have.

[Together]
Alvin! 
Okay, okay.

Maybe once.

<i>[Silverware Clatters
On Floor]</i>
Or twice.


<i>Poor guy.</i>

He really needs
a friend.

And a tube
of super glue.

[Chattering, Laughing]

No, don't do that.

<i>Don't do that.
Stop. Now.</i>

<i>[Footfalls]</i>

Aaaah!

Mommy! Aaah!

[All Screaming]

Hmm. A seven-letter word
meaning "creature."

Monster!

Of course.
Thank you, Janey.

This should be
a perfect place...

for our first
friendship lesson.

[Grunting, Chuckling]



No! No, Frankie!
It's hers!

<i>Give it back, Frankie.
Give it here.</i>

Here you go.
Sorry.



Okay.

I know someone
who needs a time-out.

Something tells me the mad doctor
didn't teach him much about sharing.

Oh, boy.
He must be an only monster.

[Bell jingling]

So, there you have it. I'm filled
with terror and self-loathing,

my job is hanging
by a thread...

and I don't have anyone to entertain
at tonight's world premiere party.

What do you think?

Well, I can't help you
with your bed-wetting,

but I can solve
your entertainment problem.

I don't know. This premiere is the
biggest thing the studio's had in years.

If it bombs--

<i>I know, I know.
You could lose your job.</i>

Nothing. N-Nothing, really.

Well...
They can't be late!

I give you my word.

Hey, Frankie, tomorrow I'm
gonna teach you how to speak.


And I'm gonna teach him
how to skateboard.

That'll be fun.


Dinner!
Yikes! We're late!

We'd better get home
before Dave does!

him his favorite lasagne.

<i>[Theodore] The ants in
France stay mainly in my pants.</i>

[Sniffling.
Muttering]

Better.

Uh-oh.

Oww-eee!

<i>[Whimpering]
Oww-eee.</i>

<i>Oww-eee.
Oww-eee.</i>

It's all right,
Frankie.

It's all right.

[Kisses, Chuckles]

<i>[Timer Bell Dings]
Voila.</i>

Dave's favorite lasagne
is ready.

<i>[Theodore]
No, Frankie!</i>

It's hot!

Aaaah! Oww-eee!

I'll get it.

Might I suggest
oven mitts?

<i>[Dave] Fellas, I'm home!</i>
Frankie! Outside!

Huh?

Huh?


Fellas, guess who's playing
at the premiere tonight?

Great!
Mmm.

Something smells great.
Lasagne?

Simon? Theodore?

W-What is it?

Alvin would never go
anywhere without his cap.

Where's Alvin?

[Roars,
Sinister Chuckle]

What is he doing?

I think he wants
to play Charades.

Ohh!
Hmm.

<i>No, No, Nanette? </i> 
The hunchback?


[Sinister Chuckle]
<i>[Gasps]</i>

<i>The doctor
took Alvin!</i>

Guys, quit playing around.
You've got a premiere to get to.

We're leaving right now.

See you there.
<i>[Monster Growls]</i>

Gee, Alvin sounds like
he's getting a cold.

[Laughing, Chattering]

<i>[Dr. Frankenstein]
â™ª I'm Sammy, Sammy, Sammy â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm a squirrel
squirrel, squirrel â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Smartest little rodent

Ack! I can't get that
annoying song out of my head.

You have ruined
my beloved monster,

and I shall
have my revenge.

You shall be
the raw material...

in my latest experiment.

Not so fast, mister.

Don't you have to have a signed
permission slip from my parent or guardian?

Joke while you can,
chipmunk.

I am going to turn you
into a mindless zombie.

Have you ever seen
a mindless zombie?

Are you kidding?
I live in Hollywood.

<i>[Theodore] Hurry!
We gotta save Alvin!</i>

Finally!

My fiendish formula
is finished!

Try saying it
three times quickly.

My fiendish finally
is formally f-f-fumpt.

My final fingly fish--

My fingle fumm--
formbilize-- femm--

Never mind!

You little pest!

Drink this before it
eats through the beaker.

No way.
It might stunt my growth.


Quite the contrary.

Excuse us. Monster.
Wow.

Monster commg, through.
Hey!

Hurry!

<i>[Man]
Wait!</i>

Can I get a shot of you
with my wife?

All right.


Wait!

What now?

Is this diet or regular?

What's going on
in there?

I don't know,

but it's locked.

<i>[Alvin]
Wait!</i>

Hey!
There's another door.

Yecch.

Now for 50,000 volts...

to complete the process.

[Gasps]
You think the
other one was a monster?

Wait till you see
what <i>you</i> turn into.


It's no use.

Oh, what are we
gonna do?

[Laughing Hysterically]

What's the matter
with us?

Oh, Frankie!

<i>Frankie.
Bad door.</i>


<i>[Electricity Zapping]</i>

[Continues Laughing]





<i>[Electrical Circuits
Humming, Winding Down]</i>

Wow.

Alvin!
Are you okay?

I-I think so-- Oww!

[Groaning, Coughing]

I don't get it.

The formula I fed him
is foolproof.

Perhaps another jolt.

I don't believe
that's the problem.

Wait a minute!
Give me that notebook!

Over my dead body!

You've come
to the right place.

Yaaah!
This ought a stop him.


You're breaking my brains!


<i>Hurry guys!</i>

My poor babies.
Papa's here.

[Monster Growling]

Alvin! Run!

[All Panting]


You won't escape so easily,

my little lab rat.

Alvin, what did
the doctor give you to drink?

I don't know.
Some purple junk.

Hmm.
"Cartoon Monster-Maker Frappe.

"Serve cold
with 50,000-volt chaser.

Then wait three minutes."

Uh-Oh.
<i>Hey, Alvin!</i>

Here's your cap.

Huh?

Aah! Aaaah!

H-Help!

Oh! Aaaah!

Whoa-oa-aah!

[Air Escaping]

Don't touch that cap!

Aah!

Huh?

What are you lookin' at,

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

you we'd get wet!

disappeared again?

No, no, no!

Tell me you're joking.

Mr. Seville,
you're not smiling.

Look at that.

Mr. Yesman, calm down.
I'm sure that--

I give you a second chance,
and this is how you repay me?

All right.
It's no more Mr. Yes Man.

Your chipmunks will never
eat nuts in this town again.

Take your hands off me.

You're frustrated.
I understand.

But do not threaten my boys.

They may be late,
but they're not monsters.

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[All Screaming]

<i>[Dave] Alvin?</i>

Thank goodness!
He's coming!

Hah!

Right at us!
Ohhhh!

Aha!


Anybody want ice?

Maybe Alvin's in here.

Hold it!
Chipmunks?

Chipmunks.
Chipmunks.

I-I'm sure
we're on the list.

Yep.
Go on in.

Oh, my.

Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

We've got to stop Alvin
quickly, or our careers--

Are history!

And that's
my worst subject.

Well,
not counting math.

Eureka!
The antidote!

Great!

Oh, no.

I have no idea where
to find these ingredients.

"Inert marine ova, the
lower limbs of an amphibian,

bovine oral organs--"

Hey!
The buffet table!

Theodore, this is hardly
the time for a snack.

No! It's the antidote!
Look!

Caviar, frog's legs,
beef tongue--

Oh. yuck!

Uh, what else?

[Sinister Giggling]

[Laughing Hysterically]

Huh?

Alvin, what do you
think you're doing?

I-I need counseling.

Quickly.

Out of my way!
I must get in!

You got an invitation?

No! But, uh--


I'll have you fired
for this!

My uncle's a producer.

<i>[Splash,

Now only one more item.

<i>Gastropoda "escargota."</i>

Got it!

<i>[Theodore Gasps]
Olivia de Handlotion!</i>

Oh, I loved you
in <i>The Sun Also Sets...</i>

and
 <i>To Kill a Hummingbird.</i>

Oh, and <i>Lady Evil.</i>

You should have gotten
an Oscar for that one!

That's what I told them!

You shouldn't
eat that.

You'll spoil
your girlish figure.

Oh!
You're absolutely right.

Gotcha!

What's with Alvin?

He's behaving like a--
like a--

Monster?
Exactly!

We know.

<i>Mr. Seville!</i>

Tell me you've got
everything under control.

Everything's fine.

There's nothing
to worry about.

<i>[Chain Saw Revving]</i> 
Whoa!

Okay, who needs
a toothpick?


Now all we have to do
is catch Alvin...

and make him ingest
this miserable goo.

Yuck! Even <i>I</i>
wouldn't eat that mess.

Houston,
we have a problem.

Apparently this stuff won't
work unless Alvin eats it...

while he's upside-down.

<i>[Crowd Cheering]</i>

Do you see him
anywhere?

<i>[Alvin] Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i> 
Unfortunately, yes.

<i>[Alvin]
Hey! Buddy boy!</i>

Hey

Can I have your autograph?

Sure, kid.

"Bud Wiley."

You stink!
[Laughing Hysterically]

Hey.

Hey!

Excuse me, darling.

Aah!

Nice try, Pops, but next
time change your cologne.

Yaaaah!


Sammy to the rescue!
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!

Let go of me,
you disgusting...

yet compassionate
rodent.

Look out!

[Guests Screaming,
Shouting]

<i>Try and catch me,

Ice?

[Alvin Laughing]

When I catch you, I'm
gonna make chipmunk stew!

Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!

get me down from here!

Ahem. May I borrow this?

Here we go, pal,
and we only get one shot.

Hmm.

One...

two...

bombs away!


[Groans, Gasps]

no! This can't be!

Hey, pal,
how'd we get up here?


Oh, my gosh.
It's Bud Wiley!

You're my favorite.
Could I have your autograph?

[Bud Screaming]

Gotcha!

Guys,
grab the other end.

Aaaah!

[Both Screaming]

[Crowd Cheering]

Marvelous!
Oh. It was fabulous.

The best publicity stunt
I've ever seen.

Especially the part where 
you screamed like a girl.

 Huh?

Yes, that was phenomenal!

My job is saved.

I mean, thank goodness
Alvin is all right.

Perhaps h-he could still
perform?

Thanks, guys. Now let's give
'em a concert they won't forget.


I'm too late!

Or am I?

Reversing the formula
takes a few minutes.

If I can just
zap him quick,

I'll have my zombie.

<i>[Audience Chattering]</i>

<i>[Emcee] Ladies and gentlemen,

No! Don't!
Nice monster!
Nice monster!

Don't! Wait! Help me!
Somebody help me!

Whoa! I'm dizzy!
Don't do this!

No! Don't! Wait!
Aaah! [Grunting]

Aaaaaah! Ohhhhh!

Thank you
so very much.

Alvin!
You're still you!

Oh, Frankie!
You saved him!


[Gasping, Murmuring]
Oh, it's a monster!

He's hurting
that little chipmunk!

Oh, my gosh!

[All Shouting]
Get him! Get him!

[Continues Growling]


Huh?
No!

Wait-- Ohh!
Outta the way, kid!

[Continues Roaring]

[Yelling, Screaming]

Put him down, Frankie.

Frankie, down.


Now, anyone who lays
a hand on him, well, uh--

well,
you won't like it.

<i>I-I mean,
you're just mean to him...</i>

<i>because he looks
like a monster.</i>

But, well, how do you know
that <i>I'm</i> not the monster? [Roars]

What's that saying? You
can't judge a book by its pages?

By its cover, Theodore.

Yeah.

So, well, maybe his cover
isn't so great,

but his pages
are really, um--

Uh, well,
you know what I mean.

[Grunting Happily]

[Imitates Grunting]
Too.

Thank you.


You the monster!
[All Cheering]

Ohh.

I'll get that Alvin yet,

as soon as I get rid of
this stupid costume.

Stupid--
Stupid thing--

No. No!

I'm trapped!
I'm doomed!

Doomed to be
Sammy Squirrel...

forever!

[Dr. Frankenstein] Is
everybody feeling Sammy?

Nyuk-nyuk!
How about you, kid?

<i>[Mother]
Oh, dear!</i>

Come on, Sammy.

Isn't it just about time
