You were a cowboy.


You'd just won the rodeo.
But you were dissatisfied.

I was some kind of wild forest man.

I was totally naked,
except for a leather vest

and a golden bowl on my scrotum.

(high pitched beeping)

Then something really crazy happened.

I finished my cigarette...
â™ª â™ª

threw down the butt...

and the entire world burst into flames.

Next.
Yeah.

So two hamburgers please.

No onion, no sauce, no pickle.

I don't want to see any
vegetable on the burger.

He's seriously about this,
all right.

Bun, burger, nothing else.

I don't want to
hear him complain.

Okay, that's two plain
hamburgers.

I am so sorry for being
so sensitive with the food

I'm going to eat,
I just love lunch.

That's okay, that's $2.36.

Yeah me and my best friend,
we're together.

Hey, good things come
to those who wait, huh?

Excuse me?

The line is very long.

Forget it.

I'm going to have one...

Excuse me?

Give me a second, all right.

I'm going to have one twenty...

Twenty piece chicken...
Stop.

I have to say the words, okay.

I'm going to have one
twenty piece chick...

One twenty piece tick...

Fuck.
Sir, I know what

you're trying to order.
I understand, okay.

But I don't want to
try to order it.

I want to order it.

I'm going to have one
twenty piece chick...


One twenty piece... fuck!

Mother fucker!

Bill, calm down, take your time.

Stop it! Okay? Fucking sit down,

you child hamburger eating
mother fucker.

Meat and bread
like a fucking baby.

Okay, I'm going to have one
twenty piece chicken nug...

One twenty piece
chick... mother fucker!

Sir.
Mother fucker!

Twenty piece chicken nuggets.


Fuck, fucking cunt
mother fucker.

Fuck this fucking place,
mother fucker.

How about you fucking clean this
fucking mess.

Mother fucker? Huh?

Just take a look, mother fucker.

Sir!
What time is it, huh?

Sir.
What can I do with these hands?

What can I do with these hands?

Tell me!


â™ª â™ª

(blowing raspberries)

Okay.

Okay.

Is that from the police?

It's a beauty.

The people who wrote that
were being really rude

so I don't know
if there's going to be

as much accuracy as you'd like.

All right, well...

how would you describe
the incident?

Just passionate,
heartfelt, overzealous

maybe a touch, yeah.

Okay.
What?

Frankly?
Yeah, give it to me

as frankly as can be,
Dr. Thrush.

Frankly, it sounds like
you're crazy.

You can't say that
to mental patients.

Bill, it was crazy.
That was very crazy.

â™ª â™ª

Fuck! I know, I know,
I know, it's just...

Are we going crazy again?
I don't know.

Okay, when I signed you out
six months ago

I thought you were ready,
that might've been a mistake.

I look at you guys now
and the look in your eyes.

I mean, we don't want
to be crazy.

You understand right?
We don't want this.

I want to walk down
the street very calm.

I want to pet
all the happy dogs.

I want to be sane,
I want to be happy.

Have you tried socializing?

Well, we live together.
I know you're friends but...

Best friends, best friends.

Okay, you're best friends.

But I think it would be healthy

to try to socialize some more

outside of this
relationship here.

To join a club
or I don't know, play softball.

No, no, no,
that's a fucking game.

I hate the game,
it's a waste of time.

Okay, no games. What about jobs?

You guys gotta work
at some point, right?

Gotta make some money.

Yeah, fuck a job
it's a nightmare.

He's right, I mean,
we're on the edge, you know,

and I don't think going
and working at Walmart

stacking a bunch of tampons up

is going to give us
a new lust for live.

Do you?
I'm sorry guys,

I'm at a loss here.
I guess, uh, we could

just go to the opera, huh?

Sit front row, sip white wine.

You know what?
I made these plans weeks ago.

I wasn't planning on
you guys barging in here.

Didn't mean to burden you
with your higher calling.

Make an appointment,
come back in here,

we'll dig into it.

I think the time to provide
help to us is right now

and you didn't do it, so.

All right, well good luck, boys.

Yeah, good luck to you.

I hope she sings great and
you're really delighted by it.

Jesus Christ.


Hey.

Hm?

I'm thinking.

I think I know why
we're going crazy.

We're not crazy we just can't
control ourselves sometimes.

Yeah but...

I think we're ignoring something
important in life, dude.

What?

I think we need women.

I think we need girlfriends.

Too trouble.

Too trouble, too much work.

We need women in our lives
in any way, dude.

It would just be better.

Think about it, if you have
a girlfriend, you know,

tickle her toes.

Go see cool movies.

Eat big pizzas.

Think about that.

Just think about... Hey,
are you listening?

Mm.
Just think about...

just think about it, if you
could make love to them

how much... how much pressure
that would relieve, you know.

Think about it.
Mm.

Don't you want a girlfriend?

Don't you want
a girlfriend?

Don't you want a girlfriend?

Don't you want
a girlfriend?

Don't you want a girlfriend?

â™ª â™ª

Don't you want a girlfriend?

â™ª â™ª

Yo, you know, it's not too late
to turn away.

It's too late for me,
give me that.

It's very hot.
Good, all the better.

And more, here come more,
more women.

Ugh.

Come on, let's go.
Okay.

â™ª â™ª

Hello.

I'm going to be
totally honest with you

because you have
that kind of eyes.

Um, I'm here looking... looking
to meet... to meet a woman

at the mall so.

You look like a nice person.

Have a good personality.

Oh, thank you, thanks.

So what's... what's your naturally
skin care routine?

What's your skin care routine?

Um.

Is that a good fabric?
Yeah, it's pretty good.

I haven't been to this mall
since Santa Claus was here

and trying to... trying to tell me
I should get a chunk of coal

and I'm like, I think... I think
I deserve the castle.

You know what I mean?
The play... the play castle.

Yeah.
Did you come here with someone?

Yeah?
Yeah, with my... my friend.

Oh okay, they take care of you?

Like you have someone?
We take care of each other.

Yeah? Okay.
Yeah, we take care of

each other, we're best friends.

Do they know that you left?

How about we cut to the chase?

Do you have a boyfriend?

That's a forward question.

I'm just, you know what?

I'm talking to as many people
as possible and uh...

â™ª â™ª

Ugh, fuck.

â™ª â™ª

Hey.

Want to uh...

Conversation?

Oh my god,
that guy's your friend?

Yeah, I'm the other dude.
Oh, are you... are you

his like watcher
or something?

Yeah, we watch each other yeah.

Okay cause he's... he's like
being a little funny,

just so you know.
What'd you say?

He's just being a little bit...

What do you mean funny?

Like his behavior?

It's a little bit inappropriate.

Oh and you're perfect.


Yeah.

Okay, these are normal girls.
Uh-huh.

And ask yourself this terrible
little question.

Are we normal men?
No.

And I know the whole time
we're here we're thinking,

"Oh these girls.
That girl, this one."

And I'm thinking another
thing at the same time.

We need two women in
the same situation we're in.

You mean two girls
who live in a basement?

No dude, I mean two girls
that are crazy, okay.

And not crazy cute like
these dolls think they are.

I'm talking fucking fire
for blood nuts, all right.

That's simply brilliant.

I know and lightning strikes
twice

'cause I got another plan.
Uh-huh.

Here's what we do.

We go to Sterling Springs.

We say we're from
the government.

We pick up girls,
give them rides home.

They don't have a good time,
fine, they got a free ride.

If they do have a good time,
they like us.

That's a girlfriend opportunity
for you and me.

Okay?

But how are we going to
get a car, Bill?

Dude, how do we get cars?

We get a car how we get a car.

Okay.
All right.

â™ª â™ª

Coward! Car keys! Car keys!

Run. Run!

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

What'd you find?

â™ª â™ª

Sterling Springs.

The nuthouse for women.

Hey.
Hm?

Gum, you want some?

Mhm, thank you.

â™ª â™ª

(wind howling)

So basically you give rides...

Dude, just relax okay?

Wow, I got it, I got it,
it's fine

Hi miss, you need a ride?

(wind howling)

We're... we're actually
with the Washington government.

They've commissioned us
to basically give rides

to people who are mentally,
you know,

having challenges
and quite upset, so.

(door slamming)

All right, buckle up.

Please, where do we take you?

The store.
Which store?

Just... the next... the next store
you see

just pull into it.

Which one?

Do you guys have any alcohol.

Have some good gin.

Fuck.

There's a lot
of fucking cops out.

Uh, just good for communities,
you know.

Hey, what's your name?

Bonnie.
Bonnie, I'm Andy.

That's Bill,
my best friend Bill.

Beautiful Bill actually.

Fuck there's too much heat
on this street, dude.

I'm not gonna lie to you
I'm freaking out.

It's okay, (indistinct).

Fuck.

This isn't working. This isn't
working. This isn't working.

What are you talking about?
It's not working, dude.

Dude, let me think.

Why... why are we stopping?

There's a cop trailing us, dude.

Ma'am, I gotta be honest
with you.

We're not a car service.

I'm sorry, we just did a fib.

For really positive reasons.

This is going to be the end
of it and I apologize.

Come on, man.
Dude, I'm a fuck up.

I fucked up, I'm sorry, okay.

Dude, I'm sorry there were cops
everywhere, you weren't...

Ugh, what's going on?

Hey ma'am, you gotta
get out of the car.

You got to get out of the car.

This is stolen, okay?
I don't care,

I haven't slept in three days.

I'm all fucked up on their shit
and my phone is dead.

Okay, um, it's going to be
worse if the cops come

and find you in the stolen car.

You're going to go to jail.
So please get out.

Jail is warm,
just leave me alone.

Look.

Ma'am. Get out.

You want me out of the car,
mother fucker?

Yes, get the fuck out.
Great, drag me out.

(car door slamming)

This... this is the wrong woman,
okay?

She's fucking crazy.

Dude, she knows our name,
she knows our faces.

We gotta... Dude, Andy!

I'm thinking.
Shut up, I'm thinking deeply.

What?

What's your big thought?

Hi miss, Bonnie.

What if we promise you
somewhere warm to sleep?

A warmer place,
a cozy place to sleep.

Very, very cozy.


Home sweet home.

This is our... this is our set up.

So.
I'm taking this one.

Yeah of course,
wherever you want.

Mess me with me and I'll cut
your fucking dicks off.

What do you think? What do you
think we're like wolves

in the woods or something?

Just don't mess with me.

Bonnie, Bill and I we are
two real gentlemen.

We don't mess with the ladies.

Congratulations.

Good for you guys.

Bill? Bill.

Where do I sleep?

Where do you think, dude?



Hey.

Hey.

Mm?
Do you want to buy me

a phone charger
and some breakfast?

â™ª â™ª

I'm sorry
I can't afford the bacon.

It's okay,
this all tastes like steak

compared to the shit inside.

Yes.

What? You've been
in the nuthouse?

Yeah, very much.

You and me, we spend
a lot of time in that place.

Why were you in there?

When I grew up in China
I felt like an alien.

People around me and nobody
understand what I do.

Nobody appreciative
of what I do.

They don't understand
Grateful Dead.

Nine Inch Nails,
Allman Brothers, b... anyway.

So I feel like,
oh, I come to America.

I got a Green Card.

English named Andy.

But I feel more lonely
than before.

People around me also listen
to soulless, heartless music.

EDM, fuck that.

So I was like, ugh,
I'm going like a man on...

I'm like a man on an island.

Very fucking lonely.

So I weep, weep.

After that I weep, weep, weep.

That's just too much weeping.

I stay long, eventually
they put me in Garden Oaks

where I meet Bill.

(muffled shouting)

Hey.

You look like the kind of guy
who could use a best friend.

I ain't gonna lie,
I'm that kind of guy too.


So why did you go in?

I've been in many times.

This time I was just being loud.

I don't have anywhere
to live right now

so I just... I stay
with my sister sometimes

but most of the time
she just kicks me out.

And a few weeks ago
I had a cut on my foot

and the only place I could wash
it was in a drinking fountain.

So I was just minding my own
business washing my foot

and everybody was
just staring at me

like I was shit.
They are wrong.

You are very much.

Thanks.

Well, I was yelling at them

and I think I scared them
and it just freaked

everyone out
and so they called the cops

and they took me
to Sterling Springs

and I mean,
you know how it goes.

Yup, that much I know.

â™ª â™ª

Bonnie, I'm glad you are crazy.

I'm not.

Even me, I'm crazy,
I wish nobody was.

I wish nobody crazy
but when I'm near you

and close to you
I feel so fucking awesome.

I feel like you seem
to have an understanding.

It's manic depression,
that'll do that.

Yeah that's the word
that they throw at me.

Well, what's wrong
with your friend?

Bill? Bill is okay.

There is totally
nothing wrong with him.

No, why was he in Golden Oaks?

You remember 9/11?


â™ª â™ª

Before we even knew
what happened

things were moving around,
shifting around.

Uh, I mean, my mind went
right to the attack in '93.

Desks were moving, chairs,

we could literally see
the floor...

Bill was a totally lover.

He hates terrorists.

So he decided to be the
opposite.

He decided to be a joyist.
A what?

A person who supply the love
and the joy to the world.

Joy? Oh a joyist?

Mhm, mhm.

â™ª â™ª

Many, many hours passed
but no people

would take any donuts.

So he spread no joy.

Only more terror.

(cellphone ringing)

It's on, I'll be right back.

Okay.

â™ª I will always eat eggs â™ª

â™ª I will always
eat eggs â™ª

â™ª I will always eat eggs â™ª

â™ª I will always
eat eggs â™ª

â™ª I will always eat eggs â™ª

â™ª I will always eat eg-eg-eggs â™ª

â™ª I will eat eggs always â™ª

What's wrong?

My sister says
I can stay with her.

She doesn't want me to be there

until she's gone tomorrow night,
so.

Come to my place, stay with me.

You don't think... I feel like
I'm bothering your friend.

I don't want to
upset him anymore.

You'll like Bill.

You'll like him, I can tell.

It will just be one more night.

One night, two nights,
three nights.

Just stay with me.

Thank you.

(train honking)


The hell?

Bill, I take Bonnie out
for breakfast.

You eat all the special cookies.

You enjoy yourself.

Sorry I was hiding them.

But save one for me.
Love, Andy.

Fuck yes, bring this women
into our lives, dude.

Show her your golden heart.


(rain pouring)


Which way?

(rain pouring)

Ugh.


(rain pattering)

No, no, no, that's okay.

Sorry.

It's okay.

Bonnie, you see that's Angel.

That pine tree,
that's Max, that's Max.

You always name the trees
like this?

No, just now for you.

To entertain you,
to make you happy.

Why are you always trying
to entertain me?

If I tell you that you'll think
I'm crazy... more crazy.

No I won't just tell me.
Nope.

Nope.

Well, I have a secret
about you too, you know.

Yeah?
Mhm.

Tell me.
No you tell me first

and then I'll tell you.

Ugh.

You know that tonight you are my
cover from the sturdiest winds,

you are shinning with the light,
golden,

a coherent song, echoing when
people touch their wine glass.

Whaa, whaa, whaa, whaa,

You just think I'm pretty.

You're more than pretty,
you are golden, solid gold.

No, I'm not golden.

You might be but I'm not.

Here hand me the bottle.

Mhm.

Slow, slow.


â™ª When I'm with you â™ª

â™ª I feel so fine â™ª

â™ª When I'm with you
I feel so alive â™ª

â™ª When I'm with you,
oh, Bonnie â™ª

â™ª I feel... â™ª

What? What are you looking at?

Where's you mother?

Quit looking at us.

Stop looking at me!

We have a life.

Get to your own fucking life.

Sh, come here, come here.

What are you doing?

People these days.

People!
You're an idiot.

People.

What are you doing?

Bonnie, let me od this.

Your eye's fine, trust me.

Just let me do this, trust me.

They lied to you.

They lied to you, you see,
it's fine, it's healing.

Uh, that feels so good.

Sorry.

(rain pouring)



(tea kettle screaming)


How... how's it going?

It's good, good... Can you... Can
you leave tonight?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What's going on?

So Bonnie and me
we kiss on the street.

Can you sneak out on the back?

Yeah.
Thank you so much.

Yeah of course, dude, of course.

Can you just do me one favor?
Yeah.

If you get a chance to make love

just don't wear a condom, okay?

You got it.
You promise?

Yeah.
Get her disease,

make babies, be real.
Make love.

Okay, I'm serious though.

She's here.
I know, I know

but this isn't robot rubber
big life, okay?

She's... she's here.
All right, just promise me.

I promise you.
All right, just say

"I promise I won't
use a condom."

I promise you.

I know but say, "I promise."

I promise.
"I won't use a condom."

Please.
I promise whatever promise.

Go, go, go, she's here.

What?
Why are you being difficult?

Just promise.
Dude, she's here.

I know but I don't believe you
until you say it.

Say "I promise
I wont use a condom."

I don't like people
forcing me promises.

Look at me, I'm uncomfortable.
I don't care.

I'm not gonna leave
until you do it.

Dude, you said you'd leave.

Once you promise me.

Why is this promise
so important to you?

Because dude, you haven't
made love in like three years.

I will do that.
All right, well say

"I promise I won't
wear a condom."

I'm not going to fucking
do a promise to this.

Yes you do,
I'm your man. Say it.

Okay, I promise you.
Promise me what?

I promise you
we will not wear a condom.

Okay, great you got it.

Go seal it.

(train honking)

I'll see you later.

(door squeaking)

â™ª â™ª

(dog barking)

â™ª â™ª

Hey cigarettes.

You gotta do it, huh.

You got one for me?
Last one, buddy.

Last one?

All right.

I don't care.

â™ª â™ª

Last night you live in
your house before it burns down.

â™ª â™ª


Oh my god.

â™ª â™ª

(mimicking gun noises)

â™ª â™ª

Boo!
Fuck.

You scared me.
Join the club.

Where's our An-Man?
He went to the store

to get some food.

Very cool.

What is that?

That is treasure.

So you and my buddy?

You're in a relationship now,
huh?

I mean, we had a good day
together.

And a fun night, right?

I don't think that's any
of your business, Bill.

Well, you know, my business,
not my business.

I don't really keep track
of that kind of thing.

I see that.
They call it making love

for a reason, right?

Sex seals relationships.

So you guys,
you're together now.

That's not how I do things.

Yeah but that mother fucker
out there getting breakfast,

I mean, he's a mad man.

Yeah, I'm right there with yah.
Okay.

So then you know that
mad men and mad women

feel things differently.

And Andy feels things hard.

Really hard.

So if you guys made love

or even if like you just
held his hand for a minute

he's going to be
in love with you.

You know, that's... that's
the way mad men work

and it's the way I work.

And that's why Andy and me,

we're in mother fucking love.

You two are in love?

It's just platonic

but it's very, very deep

and it might even be stronger

than what you guys could form

because there's no
sexual complications

or anything like that.

But if you are with Andy

you're also with me.

I don't understand
what you're saying.

I'm talking about that me
and Andy are friend-married.

One, two, three, friend-married.


â™ª â™ª

I love you.

I could feel my blood
going into him

and I could feel
his blood going into me

and it was just
like from then on

we're both each other's dad's

and then we're also
both each other's sons.

But once you come into this

you're not going
to be my daughter.

You know what
you're going to be?

What? What am I?

You're gonna be my mommy.

You know what I mean?

Like, just like take care of me,

nurture me, just mommy stuff,
you know, it's like...

(mimicking baby crying)

Change my poopy diappy, mommy.

You know,
just joking way like...

(mimicking baby crying)

Hey, what's going on?

Oh, I was just telling Bonnie

that she's my mommy
and you love her.

Oh.
You love her, right?

Yeah.
See? Told you.

This nutball's in love.

Well, I got you guys
some burritos.

Oh hell yeah.
Burritos for everyone.

Thank you.
Thanks.

It's good.


â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

Hey.
Hey.

How's it going?
Good, how are you?

I'm okay.

Did I beat Andy here or?

No, he's just in the bathroom.

Ah, so you're pretty rich huh?

Uh, it's my sister's.

Oh yeah.

Well hey, I have an idea.

What if we drink
all your sister's booze?

You into that?
I'm into that.

Bonnie Mommy,
I knew I liked you.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, it's the man of the hour.

How's it going?
Good, real happy

to see you.
All right, count to 20,

you ready?
Mhm.

So this is when
they were in a meeting

and this PowerPoint presentation
on...

social media interactivity
or something like that

and all of a sudden,
in the light of the projector

is this shadow.

And I look over
and there's this coke can

that was on the middle
of the conference table,

has risen up
and it was just floating

in the light of the projector.

That's crazy.
I just like stopped breathing.

I was blown away, I'm like
wh... what... how is this happening?

And I look around and all of
a sudden my boss stops talking,

snatches it out of the air

and then just finishes
the presentation.

What the fuck?
Yeah and then everyone

just gets up to leave

and I'm like, we just saw
a fucking divine thing

you numbskulls.

What'd they say
when you said that?

I didn't actually say that,
not then.

You should've said it.
Sh, sh.

I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

And so later that night
I go home to tell my husband

about it and he's like "So what?
You believe in God now?"

And I'm like
"Yeah, I believe in God

and I believe he spoke to me."

And you know what he said?
Drink coke?

No.
Wait, drink Pepsi.

No.

He said the opposite.

You know, he blocked
that profane light

with God's light to tell me that
the life that I was leading

was shit and I deserve better.
Yeah, it makes sense.

That impetus that moment where
God showed himself to me

was real, I wasn't crazy
in that moment.

It's just, you know,
when I told people

I... I think I shouted it.

Yeah, it's like a passionate
thing to say, right.

Yeah, well,
I shouted a lot of things.

I went around trying
to find any kind of messages

that I could find.

Only I think I was imagining it
most of the time

and then I just... I don't know,

I just kind of lost it
and I became homeless

and lost my friends
and you know how it goes.

You know, people are mean.

People are...
Sh, sh, sh.

Just the life I'm leading now
is so much better

than the life I was leading
with my stupid husband.

Life with Andy.
Huh?

That's the life you're living
now, life with Andy.

And let me tell you,

that's as good as it gets.

Yes of course.

So far so good

and it's only going
to get better.

I promise.

Okay, I trust you.

â™ª â™ª


Shoot the dragon.
Right there?

Yeah.
Ugh.

I'm gonna get him.

He dead, he dead.

He's dead.


He's dead.

(water dripping)

What was the dragon's name?

Um, The Red One.

The Red One?
Yeah.

He goes, de-blah.

He dead.


Bill?
Yeah.

You are the dragon.
Shut the fuck up.

â™ª â™ª

Mm.

Hey, sorry.

Um.
What are you doing

in my room?
So I just um,

I think you might be pregnant.

No, I can't get pregnant.

Trust me, I tried hard.

What do you mean you tried?

You feel like you
had a lot of love?

You made a lot of love or what?

No like vitamins, hormones, IVF.

I don't... It's none
of your business.

Okay, I had a dream
that me and you and Andy

and our son were walking through
the forest

and we killed a dragon
and ate it

but when I have dreams
this vivid

and this intense it usually
means there's something

true about it, okay?
Mhm.

I just think you might
want to piss on a test

and lay off the sauce
'cause you could really

possibly be pregnant.
Okay, sure.

Just get out,
you're gonna wake Andy.

I'm not gonna wake that guy,
dude.

He'll sleep through anything,
watch.

What are you doing?
Oh shit.

Sorry Andy.

Um, did you just dream
about dragons?

No why?
No reason.

No reason at all.

You got room
for one more in here?

Mm, yeah.

â™ª â™ª

(slow motion laughing)

â™ª â™ª


Uh Andy, good to see you dude.

Here, you want some yellow rice?

Mhm.

Mm.

What's going on?

Dude, you were right.
Dr. Thrust is gay?

I knew it, dude,
I fucking knew it.

It's Bonnie, Bonnie pregnant.

Dude, why are you so glum?

That's amazing.

That's great, dude.

You think a women's good
to have around?

Dude, a baby
is ten times better.

A baby's like a ball
of pure light.

Nothing's better than a baby!

This is great.

You don't have to feed the baby.

I just fed you, didn't I?

I'm a natural, come on here.

No, no, whatever you say

you don't have to buy the food.

Dude, look, do you love Bonnie?

You love life? You love babies?

Then look what you have, man.

This is good for us, okay.

I just don't...
Don't... no, don't act like

this is a bad thing, come on.

I just don't want to get a job.

Who the fuck said
you have to get a job?

Baby costs so much money,
I'll have to get a job.

No dude, you don't need a job
you just need money.

I have to get a job.
No dude, money.

Listen to me, a job.
No, dude.

You just need money, okay.

(car humming)

We need to get like shotguns,
AKs, Uzis.

If they're not real they've
got to be real enough looking

to fool a little
near-sighted bank guard.

Here he come snow.

Psh, look at this wimp.

They should've hired us
to guard this bank.

You think you could
take this guy out?

Yeah, easy.

Fuck yeah, dude.

One solid Chinese kick
to the chest, he's down.

All right, what do we got?

We've got a shotgun, new shoes...

Running shoes.
Yeah, okay, running shoes.

What else?
Latex gloves, pantyhose.

Pantyhose.
Yeah.

Distraction mannequin.
Perfect.

Energy bars.
Pumpkin pie.

Chocolate, chocolate.
Both, both.

Okay, black... black clothes.

Perfect.
Mhm.

Goddamn, look at that
juicy bank, buddy.

I can already taste it.

Taste what?

Red wine.

Come on, let's go.
Okay.

I don't know what Mitchel
told you but uh...

Whoa, whoa.
Oh sorry.

How do you?
It's right there.

Keep that there.
I'm actually going on safari,

hunting gorillas.

Pretty aggressive breed
actually.

They uh, they tend to
come at you all at once

when you take their bananas
from their banana banks.

You know what I mean?
I don't and I don't want to.

Um, I would go with
the shotgun here though.

Okay.
I could do uh, $300 on it.

Okay.

Um, here's the deal
I'm gonna have to pay you

after I get the bananas.

See cause I'm broke.

But once I do the gun thing
I'll have the money to pay you.

All right, you know what,
you gotta go man.

What?
You gotta go.

I'm gonna pay you
whatever you want.

You gotta go, okay.

I just don't have money right
now.

That's why you gotta go.

I'm not really scared of guns.

Please go.
Okay, okay.

You missed an opportunity.

(door slamming)

Bill, what did you do
last night?

I just went at looked at
the cat.

What's that mean?

Uh, like 18 months ago
me and Andy

found this dead cat
in like an empty lot.

We've just been
watching it decompose

every time we walk by

and it's in this
awesome stage now.

Like it's bones
have turned into these like

little glistening toothpicks
in the dirt.

It's really beautiful actually,
so.

Bill, Bonnie and I,
we are eating.

It's okay.
Good for you,

I gotta go to the bathroom.

â™ª â™ª

Jesus.

Bonnie, I saw a black widow
run in here so I just...

I saw you take
my sister's jewelry.

You're a terrible liar.
All right, fine,

I'm sorry, here.

You win, okay? Sorry.

No harm, no foul okay?

What... what are you guys
doing in there?

Oh we're just talking about
a bunch of sports scores.

Just shit you don't like.
Basketball stuff.

He as stealing
my sister's jewelry.

Do you have any idea
what my sister would do

if she thought
I was stealing from her?

Huh, Bill?
I'd be homeless again.

Well, you wouldn't be
homeless again.

I would never let
that happen to us, okay.

And I wasn't stealing her stuff.

I was borrowing it to pawn it,
okay.

What do you need it for?

I can't... I can't tell you
that part.

Andy, what's going on?

I don't want to deal
with this shit.

Don't tell her.
What so you're just gonna

walk away from this?
Yeah, he just... he just...

let him be... let him
be away from this,

you're whipping something up
here.

Bill, why did you take the gold?

I can't tell you, okay.

It just was really, really,
really important.

I'll find another way but it
was the first plan, you know.

Please,
what is this noble cause?

It's like a cool glorious thing

but I just can't tell you, okay.

What, you don't trust me?

No, I mean, honestly

with this kind of info
I'm not there with you yet.

I don't trust you, so.

I'm sorr... Bonnie,
what do you want from me?

How can I tell you
my biggest secret

of what I'm going to do,
you know what I mean?

Bill, tell me.

Can I... can I... you promise you
won't tell anybody else?

Yeah.
All right, I'm robbing a bank.

Me and Andy are robbing a bank.

What the fuck? What?

What's so funny about that?

You're not robbing a bank.
Yes I am and so is...

Yeah, Andy's going to come in
there with a fucking six shooter

and I'm going to be being like
watch... watch...

I'm going to tell
all the fucking tellers

"That mother fucker's going
to kill you."

I gather up the money and we
leave and then you have money.

Bill, you're a child,
you're an actual fucking child.

You couldn't get your shit
together to even

walk into a bank
let alone rob a bank.

I don't have my shit together?
Uh-uh.

You're homeless,
crazy and pregnant.

Yes, Andy told me,
you're pregnant

and we need to take
care of you and the baby.

If we rob a bank
you have a good healthy baby.

Think about it.
Stop talking about my baby.

Okay, look,
I can talk about that child

because I dreamt it, all right.

I coerced sperm to egg
with my mind.

I'm part of all this happening.

I'm not insane, I'm not, I'm
not, I'm not insane for that.

Get out of my house!
Oh my god.

First off, it's not your house.

It's your sisters, okay.

And if she knew that
I was trying to help you

get out of it she'd say,
"Bill, you stay.

You make your plan,
get Bonnie out of your hair."

Get out of my house
or I'm calling the cops.

Look, I'm a quarter Cherokee.

Listen, this land is mine.

Get out of my house.
Oh my god.

You know I'll hit women right?
Fine, hit me,

fucking hit me
and see what happens.

Just fucking hit me, Bill.

I... I... I
Yeah, that's right

you're pathetic.
I'm not pathetic.

I'm going to rob a bank.
Leave Andy of out this.

Get the fuck out
of my house, go.

Really?
Yeah, you're a piece of shit.

You won't talk to me?
You piece of shit idiot.

Goddamn.

(door slamming)

Way to call a guy's bluff.

(muffled shouting)

Here we go.

Yeah, that's it, that's her.


(door slamming)

Ugh, fuck.

What's wrong?

She's going to dump me,
I know it.

No, dude, she's going
to forgive us in the morning.

Look, what's important is that
we set a precedent in there.

All right?
You don't mess with the boys.

Ugh, it's fucking terrible.

Dude, hey, hey, this dick?

She's addicted to this dick,
all right.

Come on,
let's just go get loaded.

Let's take it to the next level,
An-Man.

I'm talking Martian,
curtain call, lime rickey.

Ready? Huh?

â™ª â™ª

(sighs, mumbles)

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

We need a peaceful moment,
need a peaceful moment.

All right, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
Need a peaceful moment.

Need to drink more.

Oh, fuck.
I gotta do this.

We got one left.

Okay, wait,
I've always wanted to do this.

You ready? Okay.

Don't move, okay?

Okay, you gotta stay still.


Look.

â™ª â™ª

Open up.


Holy shit, it's gonna work.

It's gonna work, okay.


Okay, it worked!

We got it.

We got liftoff.

â™ª â™ª

Is it fun?

So delicious.

You look like a little baby.


â™ª â™ª


Andy?

(train whistle blowing)

Andy?

(train whistle blowing)


â™ª â™ª

Andy?

(horn honking)

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(food splats)

(door opens)

An-man.

Where you been, dude?

Bonnie's.

It's Bonnie's sister's, okay?

Don't let her get up
on her high horse.

She's a bag lady.

Don't let her forget that,
all right?

Dude, want another cigarette?

Yeah.

Here you go,
a little Martian milk for you.

Thank you.

You got a full pack, huh?

Where'd you get that?

That's not important.

Let me tell you something.

I got in a huge fight
with Bonnie about you.

What do you mean? How so?

So basically
she gave me a show...

how do you say, showdown?

Showdown.

She gave me a showdown,
she's like,

"Andy, it's you and me
or you with Bill."

And then you just came
right over here?

(Bill laughs)

That's fuckin' awesome, dude.

I'd have given anything
to see her expression.

Was she just like,
"Oh, Andy, please stay with me?

I'm so sorry.
I love you, Andy.

I made a mistake."

Fuck, Bill, I have to move out.

Wait, she said that or...

No, I decide to move out.

No, fuck that, dude,
that's bullshit.

You know that's bullshit.

Don't move out of here.

No, dude.

That's not...
This is your home, man.

I'm in love.
I know you're in love,

but that doesn't preclude me
from being part of it.

I'm part of it,
and I've talked to her about it.

But you're not part of this.

She doesn't want you
being a part of this.

That's just 'cause
I fought with her, man.

I'm serious, dude,
I can get her some flowers,

bring some roses to her,
I can make things up to her.

Dude, that's not a good idea.

That's a bad idea.
Don't do that.

Okay, look, look, look,
then what about this?

Okay, look,

how about this?

We'll drink these drinks,
we'll rest our big brains,

and we come up
with a new plan, okay?

And we get you a new woman,
one who loves you even more

and one who likes me,
all right?

That's what we do,
that's all we gotta do, man.

I'm late.
Seriously, late for Bonnie?

Fuck Bonnie, dude.
Dude, with Bonnie, I feel sane.

With you, when you're here,
I feel insane.

I want to be sane.
I get it, okay, fine, fine,

but she's not making you sane,
dude.

Look at you, she's making you
into some kind of goofball.

You're fucking dressed like
a little chocolate bunny.

It's fucking ridiculous.
Dude,

Bonnie put a lot
of strong in me.

Dude, that doesn't even
make sense in English.

It makes sense to me.
Well, it doesn't make sense

to the rest of America.

Bill.
What?

I have to go, I really...

Bonnie's waiting for me.
No, you don't have to go.

This is our place, we're gonna
hang out here a little bit.

All right?
Sit the fuck down.

Dude, you put me
in this situation all this...

How the fuck did I...
...to try to steal her stuff,

all this bank robbery stuff.
Bullshit, that was your...

You wanted to rob
a bank, too, dude.

I just talked to her about it.
Sorry for being fucking honest.

Okay?
I'm late.

Stop it, stop it!
Dude, I don't like this.

You don't like what?
I'm late.

You don't like what,
motherfucker, huh?

Go, get the fuck outta here.

I don't even fucking want
to be around you.

Dude, I don't like this.
You don't like this?

I don't like this either.

So goodbye.
Okay, fine.

Look at you, Mr. Cool.

Fight me, you fuck.

Come on, fight me, fight me!

(slams table)

Motherfucker. Motherfucker.


Calm down.

Calm down. Calm down.

(birds chirping)


Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

(bottles clattering)

Huh?

Let me go, let me go.

Let me go, okay? Let me go.

Fuck you.

Don't go, dude.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Dude, I'm nothing without you.

Dude, I don't want to hurt you.

Just don't go, I'm sorry.

No, dude...
I'm sorry, dude.

I'm sorry.
It's the last chance.

I just don't know what to do.

Let me go, okay?
I just don't know what to do.

I don't want to hurt you.
I don't know what to do.

I don't know...
Let me go.

(dog barking)

(Bill breathing heavily)

(train honking)



Come on.


â™ª â™ª

Think I'm a bad fucking
family member, huh?

Think I'm
a bad family member, Bonnie?

Oh, what's in the bag?

Two hundred thousand dollars
cash for you

and your unborn baby.

No, no, no, no,
I won't take any, I don't...


(spray can rattling)


â™ª â™ª

(can clatters)

â™ª â™ª

(traffic rushing)

Sir?

Can I help you?

I don't know,
is your name Benedict Arnold?

Excuse me?

You ever wanna get
in there, huh?

You wanna get in here?
You ever wanna get in there?

Yeah, I work here.

It's your lucky day, cabrÃ³n.

What do you mean,
it's my lucky day?

It's a two-man job.

It's a two-man job.

Two-man job? Okay.


(glass shattering, clattering)

Anybody home?

Huh, anybody home?

All right, how about this?

Little music?

Little bit of dance, huh?

â™ª â™ª

You wanna dance with Bill?

Come on.

I'm having fun out here!

I'm having a blast!

Come on, motherfuckers!

Okay.

No dancing, huh?

â™ª â™ª

Where'd you get this,
from little Grammy Fanny, huh?

Little Grammy Fanny?


â™ª â™ª

I'm just gonna take a piss
out here, all right?

Here I go.

I'm going.
Bill, don't pee in there.

It's a bluff, it's a bluff.

You think I don't know
the rules?

Get Bonnie out here, we need
a family meeting right now!

We're not a family.
Time to talk bank robbery.

We are not a family, Bill.

Oh, no?
Yeah, we're not.

Okay, so she's already
out here, huh?

She tucked in your cheek,
or has she got a string

tied around your prick
and she's tugging on that?

Why'd you even come here?
I came here because I love you

and we have a really fucking
important bank robbery to do.

If you love me,
you'll leave me alone.

That doesn't make sense.

If you love someone,
you want to be around them.

That's the whole fucking point.
I'm finally in love.

(unintelligible)
You keep saying "love"

so many fucking times,
it's lost all meaning.

You love, love, love.

Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah?

But I'm a part of it, Andy.

I'm a fucking part of it.

You're not gonna be
a part of this.

Yes, I am, okay?

I don't care what you think
or what you're thinking now

or what you thought.

Open your heart to me.

Open your fucking heart to me
like we promised

and talked about, Mommy.

Do you remember?
You're insane.

I called the cops.

Good, me and the boys in blue
go way back.

I can't wait
for a little reunion.

Bring 'em on, bring 'em on,
let's see what happens.

Bill, Bill, Bill...
Bullets!

Bill, just leave,
don't go to jail.

I'm not going to jail,
I didn't do anything.

Look at that,
you're breaking and entering!

You also assault me.
Assault?

You ever think maybe
I'm trying to just open up

a fucking third eye
on your head, huh, huh?

You think that maybe, huh?
Hey, stop.

She needs to see God again.
Don't point your finger at me.

She needs a place
where she can see God.

This is the kind of insane talk
that I don't want to be around.

That's the kind of talk you need
'cause you need to see God

and you've been thinking it
since I met you.

I can see it
in your fucking eyes,

there's no God here.

What?
You leave.

I leave?
Yeah, you showed who you are

you made her upset,
I don't want...

Oh, look at you,
Mr. Fucking Calm, huh?

You remember who used
to pet your head, huh,

when you were all suicidal
and crying?

Who did that?
It's not like that anymore.

It's not, no?
It's not like that anymore.

Yeah, 'cause you get one sip
of the golden cup,

and all of a sudden,
you have everything figured out.

And I'm the fucking fool,
and I'm the fucking idiot?

Stop babble at us...
Babble?

Rhapsody, motherfucker.
That's rhapsody.

Stop! Bill, stop.
Listen,

you really want me
to fucking leave, huh?

Yup.
You want me to leave?

Yeah, do you?
Please leave.

Okay, look me in the eyes,
tell me you don't love me.

I don't love you.
Okay, fine.

Tell me you fucking hate me
I fucking hate you.

Fine. What the fuck's
the point of life, huh?

What's the point of any of this?
No love?

Just leave, okay? Just leave.
Fucking nightmare.

You're living
in a fucking nightmare,

and I don't want
to go in there.

Fuck this, Andy.

You're gonna come crying
back to me!

I'm going to fucking Jupiter!

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

â™ª Open up the churches pass â™ª

â™ª to try to find a window â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Leaving all the ghosts in us â™ª

â™ª to stand in a holy river â™ª

â™ª As your shadow falls on me â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Cast through treasure
of ivory â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Meet me at the snowy plain â™ª

â™ª where we want adventure â™ª

â™ª You will call me by my name â™ª

â™ª A voice made of winter â™ª

â™ª As your shadow falls on me â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Cast through treasure

â™ª â™ª

â™ª As your shadow falls on me â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Cast through haze of memory â™ª

â™ª Some will live

â™ª And some will rise to glory â™ª

â™ª I'm no longer asking why â™ª

â™ª I just tell the story â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Holy shadow â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Oh, holy shadow â™ª

â™ª â™ª

(wind howling)

Okay.

So now, I want you
to shut your eyes

and think of a shape and color
that you feel defines you.

We're going to go
around the circle,

and once everyone's had
a chance to speak,

we're going to discuss
what each of us said.

Ollie?

You go first.

An orange square,

like my hairs.

Great.

Now you, Tim.

Uh, an egg.

What color?

Just an ordinary egg.

Okay.

Now you, William.
Bill.

Okay, Bill.
Beautiful Bill.

And what do you see?

(fire crackling, bellowing)

A black arrow.

â™ª â™ª

(ball bouncing, jingling)

â™ª â™ª


(ball bouncing)

â™ª â™ª


What?

What do you want?

â™ª â™ª

(Bill laughing)

No, no.

No, uh-uh.

You gotta get up in there.

You gotta get deeper.

There's little hairs
up in here.

No, which part?

Oh, God, here,
just let me do it,

let me do it.

So the asshole split
on you, huh?

Yup.

What happened?

I'm not a good partner.

Dude, you're the best partner.

No, as a partner in romance.

I got fired from so many jobs.

Bonnie and I were

No, she left.

How long you been solo?

Six months.

Tale as old as time, brother.

A man/woman situation
is tenuous at best.

So you know what
you gotta do now, right?

Yeah, get her back.

(grunting, screaming)

Bill!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Dude, Bill...

I'm sorry, but, here.

We're not gonna get
her back, okay?

Your kid, we gotta get
your kid, okay?

We're gonna...
we're gonna kidnap your son.

Okay? That's all that matters
right now, all right?

What's his name?
George.

Dude.
What?

Zechariah,
the firstborn is Zechariah.

Whatever, we'll change his name
when we get him back.

First we just gotta get me
outta here.

Bill, Bill.
What?

Are you okay?
Are you sane?

I still... I just... I have like
this new kind of humming,

like an e... it's like an ext...
like an internal/external energy

that's just like pulsing in me
and it's making me stronger,

but I'm fucking crazy,
I am fucking crazy,

but I feel like if I could have
you and your son,

you'll keep me sane, right?

Yeah.

Really?
Yeah, of course.

You're still my best friend?

Always best friend.

Then we just gotta get me out.
Yeah.

My opinion of myself right now
is just like off the charts.

Like it's very, very, very high.

"Very, very, very..."

Three verys.

"Very high."

Do you think that's the problem?

I don't know,
how would you define "problem"

in that context?

Well, you know,
when you're manic,

you tend to self-aggrandize
quite a bit.

Well, that's in the past, right?

Like, when I say it now,

I mean like,
a solid B+ gentleman.

Like I'm just feeling like
a good, regular guy

looking to live
a good, regular life

in that old good, regular world,
you know?

And, uh, honestly, doc,
it's like,

when you think about it,
I've been in here four years

for one night of Wolfman,
and you and I both know

it's time for me
to be unleashed, you know?

Are you sure you want that,
you know, and the regular life?

You talk about monotony
all the time.

Yeah, but, I mean,
I realize like

the quote-unquote
"regular world,"

that's where
the uncharted terrain is

and where I think I can
accomplish my life goals

and contribute to society
in that healthy way.

Do you know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.

You understand?
Yeah.

I'm ready for it, sir.

Are you, Bill?
Hundred percent.

I have no doubts.

I don't know.

(clock ticking)

â™ª â™ª

So you're living
in here, dude?

Yeah, terrible.
Yeah?

Well, it's good, dude.

It's a good thing.

Living in your car is cool,
all right?

Where's Bonnie at?

Bonnie moved in
with her new boyfriend,

into his mansion.

What do you mean, a mansion?
A mansion.

Oh, fuck, dude.

I'm sorry, but with a mansion?

You're kinda fucked, man.

He's got statues everywhere,
fucking topiary,

all that gilding.

People get entranced
by that shit, dude.

It was terrible.

So you've been there?
Yeah, four times.

Yeah, what, did they sit you
down for some big, weepy talk?

"Oh, Andy, we're in love now.

I'm so sorry, Andy.

It's our time for love."

Oh, stop, stop.
They do that?

Yeah, they also fucking kissed
a couple of times.

Jesus fucking Christ,
what'd you do?

I tried to burn
that motherfucking place down.

That's my man.

Well, when you were there,

you weren't just getting
a big, weepy talk.

You know what else
you were doing?

Do you?
What, what?

You were doing reconnaissance.

(dog barking)

I just gotta visit
my sleepy buddy here real quick.

Think he'll, uh...


...hook us up.

(brakes squealing)

All right.

Keep the car running, okay?

Hey, don't be so sad, all right?

We're getting your son.

(television playing)

(tires screeching on TV)

(car crashing on TV)

Oh, what's going on?

Hey, what's up?

Um, I'm Douglas Peterson,
I'm friends with Randall.

Oh, Randall's asleep.

Yeah, of course he is.

Uh, I got something
to drop off for him.

You mind if I head up?
Go for it.


Early bird strikes again.

(snoring continues)

Thanks for the worms,
you lazy bastard.

â™ª â™ª

See?

Yup.

You look like a fucking monster.

Fuck.
Terrifying people,

and then you're like...
hey, you're like...

Here, here, dude,
are you doing it right?

â™ª â™ª


Dude, don't be a baby.

No, don't, that's...

Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.

Dude, it's your hair bristles,
they're like Velcro.

Chill out.

Dude, I don't think...
this isn't going on.

No, no, no.

(bottles clink)


Let's do this.

Ready?
Yeah.

Okay, okay, look at me.

You're gonna be brave?
Yeah.

How brave do you think
I'm gonna be?

Super, super fucking brave.

George.
George.

Family.
Family.

George.
George.

Family.
Family.

George.
George.

Family.
Family.

(chanting accelerates)

Let's go!

(crickets chirring)

(breathing heavily)

(door rattling)

Fuck.


It's locked.

Yes, yes, yes.

Go, go, go, go.

(dog barking)

(breathing heavily)

(door opens)

(breathing heavily)

(door open, light flicks on)

Mama?
Hey, hey, hey.

Come on. Yeah, come on.

(breathing heavily)

Go, go, go, go.

George.

Hey.

Come with me, come with me.

Hey, little boy.

Do you remember me
from when I dreamed about you?

Let's go.

(video game beeping)

(door opens)

(crickets chirring)


Who's the rock star?

(glass shattering)

(playful shouting)

(Bill laughing)

You're more fun than adults.
I hate adults.

Adults are the worst.
I'm saving the snake.

Bill.
What?

Don't make him feel this way.

George, come over here.

Brush your teeth.

Come.


What was that?


Come here, I think it's Sam.

Sam?

Fuck, that's him.

It's fucked now.

All right, here's what we do.

What?
Listen, listen,

just stay totally quiet,
stay totally quiet.

Okay.
Okay?

I'm just gonna wait out here,

so whenever you're ready
to talk, let me know.

I got cigarettes.
Cigarettes!

What do we do?

You know what I say, Andy?
You say shit all the time.

I say if you see a snake
in the woods, gobble it up.

Put that kid in the bathroom.

Go, go, go, stay inside.

Your uncle Bill and Daddy
need to fight a monster.

You want me to go
in the bathroom?


Hey.
Bill?

Yeah, Beautiful Bill.
Come on in, come on in, dude.


Turn the fuck around.

Put your hands
behind your back, now.

Put your hands
behind your back.

Why are you doing this?
I just...

I'm doing this because...
There's no tr...

I don't know who...
hey, buddy, buddy, buddy.

I don't know who the fuck
you are, all right?

Put your wrists together.

Put them together.

I...

There you go.
I just wanted to talk

to you guys.

Never been fucking
tied up before, huh?

No.

Well, first time
for everything, bud.

Turn the fuck around.


Huh, huh, huh?

Look at me.

What are you doing here?

I just wanted to talk...
What the fuck is this?

It's whiskey 'cause I wanted
to have a drink with you guys.

No, that's poison,
all right?

We're not drinking your poison,

and I'm not falling
for your fucking tricks, okay?

What's going on?
I know that

you took George, all right?

Bullshit, that did not happen.

We did not take George.

I don't even know who that is.


I know you took him,
and I understand.

If I was in your position,

I'd probably do the same thing,
okay?

What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

If you will just listen to me.

I basically just wanted
to kind of lay things out

from a different perspective
and have a rational conversation

without this shit going on.

What, this shit?

This isn't a boardroom, okay?

We're not a couple
of your investors,

and we're not gonna watch

a friffin'
PowerPoint presentation

on how you're some kind
of man of the hour, get that?

I'm not trying to talk
like that,

I'm not trying to sound...
You are talking like that,

you're sounding like
a fucking fake.

Okay...
Do you get it?

I'm not trying to sound phony.

I'm sorry, I'm just nervous.

What do you expect with
a gun in my face?

What do I expect?
I expect behavior.

I expect compliance.

Andy, you can vouch for me.

I don't know you.

We know each other a little bit.

Now you think I'm important?

Now you're asking me for help?

You ruined my life.

You ruined his fucking life.

Look, you know me...
you know me a little bit...

I don't know you.
It's nothing personal.

No, no, Andy does,
and you, I know...

I know about you
from stories.

Yeah? What kinda stories?
Horror stories?

And now you walked into one,
ding-dong.

You don't need to do this,
all I wanted to do

was just come here and show you
I'm a good, honest person.

That's, you know, we're gonna be
the judge of who you are.

Sam, where'd you get
all your money?

Why you are so rich?
Where's your money from?

Where's your fucking money from?

From... just from tech.

Technology, technology.

That's fucking boring.

Fine, it's boring,
but you know, it doesn't matter

'cause there's two things
that can happen now, all right?

One, the cops can get involved
if you guys keep this up

and Bonnie flips out and then
you never see George again,

but there's the other option,
if you listen to me,

where you give me George
and I put him back in bed,

I get him home real quick
before Bonnie knows anything,

and we can forget
any of this ever happened.

All right, and then I'll talk to
Bonnie and I'll reason with her

and I'll make sure you guys
are a part of George's life.

Or, how about this,
what about this option?

What do you say to me just
blowing your cock off right now?

What would you say to that?

Don't.
Don't?

(Bill laughs)

Sam, I actually like that.

Succinct, smart.

You know, if you say
enough things I like,

guess what happens then.

What?

Could end up liking ya.
Great, I'd like that.

You would? Why?

Because I like you!

You don't like me,
you don't fucking know me!

I'd like to know you,
I like your vibe.

Fucking empty compliments.

Come here.

You don't need...
you don't need to do this.

Hey, fuck you.

Look, you stay right
the fuck here, okay?

Look, stay right here.

Look at me!
Stay here, okay?

You fucking move an inch
while we're gone,

cock off, life gone,
cock off, life gone.

That fucking order.

You will feel it.

What do you think?

I hate that motherfucker!

Yeah, I see why
you feel that way.

You don't?
Well, I mean,

I know I'm being
all macho in there,

but I don't think he's lying.

Dude, he's a fucking liar!

Look at you though,
you're an emotional mess.

You can't even think straight,
dude.

You can think straight?

Yeah, yeah, straight
as a black arrow, okay?

And I think if we just sit him
down and we have a talk...

We walk in, we kill him,
we go to Mexico.

You know I've never
really killed anybody, right?

I've been lying,
I've been telling fibs.

If you're my best friend,
you fucking kill him.

Yeah, I will kill him,
I'll kill anybody you want,

but you gotta give me three
minutes with him first, okay?

I gotta check something.

Three minutes?
Three minutes.

You're asking me
to fucking kill somebody, okay?

It's the least you can do.

(door opens)

(door closes)


A lot of options here, Sam.

You're a businessman,
you know it's hard to, uh,

pull the trigger sometimes,
so to speak.

Come here.

Think you made a few mistakes
with my buddy out there.

Come a little closer.

Perch up real good.

So, we're gonna play a game now.

I'm not talking Monopoly.

I'm talking Ouija board,
next-level shit.

You ready for that?

Sure.

Let me ask you a question first.

Are you a good man?

I'm okay.

You sure about that?

Yeah.


You ever go crazy before?

Like your head was spinning
around in a dryer set on high?

Huh, have you?
Yeah.

For real?
Yeah.

Yeah?

All right,
then you're invited in.

Stare into my eyes, okay,
stare deep into my eyes.

Not this one, this one's dead.

Stare here.
All right.

Come on in.

Come in.

Deeper.

Come on, deeper.

Deeper, deeper.

Don't fear the sharks
of my soul.

I only look scary.

I need you to think
about dragons, okay?

Got 'em?

Got it.
Good.


That's very, very, very good.

You're a sensitive man,
aren't you, Sam?

I'm okay.

Yeah, I know you're okay.

Are you sensitive?

Yes, I am.

Yeah, I can tell.

I like it.

I like it a lot.

Do you feel weird
about being rich?

All the time.

Why don't you give
all your money away?

I'm scared I won't make
any more.

Why'd you buy
such a big old house?

I don't know, I thought
it would impress the girls.

Did it?

Yeah.
Yeah, bees like honey.

Big news.

All right.

I'm gonna forgive the wealth.

Can you forgive my being poor?

Yes.
You know how poor I am?

No.
I have $11.

That's it.


We're gonna go
to the next level now,

'cause I'm seeing
some good things in you.

Can you put the gun down?

(gun tapping)

We're going in deeper now.

We're gonna go somewhere
not a lot of people have been.

Are you ready for that?
Okay.

Move away from the live eye.

Go into the dead eye, okay?

Stare into the eye
of old Dead-Eye Bill.

Pass through that darkness.

In there?

(deep exhale)

Oh yeah, you're in there.

We're gonna have to do this
for a long, long time,

and you're gonna show me
just who you are.

(train rumbling)

(clacking slows)

(eerie high-pitched sound)

(heart beating)

(train whistle blowing)


Whoa!


Okay, Sam.

Okay.

(door opens)

Hey.
Yeah.

So?

So he's a living,
breathing man, dude.

Living, breathing man?

Yeah, yeah, he's good, okay?

I took him into the house
of my soul.

I spun him around, I looked
at him from every fucking angle,

and he's good,
and we should give him the kid.

No! Fuck this, fuck this plan.
Give me the gun.

Put your money
where your mouth is.

What do you mean?
I mean we're always talking

love, right?
Love, love, love?

Try to love him.
Oh my God,

this is the guy
who ruined my fucking life,

who stole my fucking family.
Yeah, yeah, right?

Now he's inviting you back
into his family, right?

He invited me back
into his fucking family?

Give me the gun,
give me the gun.

Fine, you want the gun?
Yeah.

Fine, here.
This is my fucking choice,

this is my fucking choice.
Fine, here's the fucking gun,

but listen, you kill him,
little George hears, right?

Right? And we can tell him
it's big, big popcorn right now,

but when he turns 13,
old man memory

is gonna start answering
questions and he's gonna know.

He's gonna know Uncle Bill
and Daddy Andy

are fucking murderers.

You think that's good for a kid?

You think that's good
for sensitive guys like us?

It'll fucking make us cry, dude.

We'll be crying and having
nightmares about him for years,

and so will little George,
and then think about this, dude:

His ghost is gonna haunt us.

You want to spend the rest
of your life haunted by a ghost?

Fucking floating over your bed?

Dripping fucking ectoplasm
all over you,

you're all goopy and shit?

It's your choice,
you do what you want.

You think about it though.

Hey.

What are you gonna do?

(train whistle blowing)

(door opens)

(door closes)

Treat Bonnie and George right.


You lucked out, bud.

You're in the family.

Kid's in the bathroom.

You made the right choice.

You just better be as cool
as I think you are,

'cause I'm looking forward
to hanging out with you.

(engine rumbling)

(brakes squealing)


Bill, I feel like
I'm shattered apart.

It's 'cause you are, dude.
You are.

If I was Bonnie,
I would have left me too.

Dude, if you were Bonnie?

No, dude, you'd be stoked
that you met

one of the coolest individuals
of all time, all right?

Andy fucking Chen.

But Bonnie's Bonnie.

Bonnie's gone.

Yeah, well, who's here?

Your ultimate homie
now and forevermore.

Beautiful Bill Andrews
at your service.

Come on, let's get you a taco.

Come on.

Get you some food.

I'm talking tacos,
burritos, tostadas.

What kinda drink you want?

What do you want, Coca-Cola?

Cocktail.

Whatever kind you want, bud.
Manhattan?

â™ª I could live my whole life â™ª

â™ª Without a phone call â™ª

â™ª The likes of which
I got today â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª It was only my wife
said hello, then goodbye â™ª

â™ª And told me she's going away â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Well, I didn't cry â™ª

â™ª It was all cut and dry â™ª

â™ª I hung up before I realized â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Turned up my stereo â™ª

â™ª I walked to the window â™ª

â™ª And stared
at the storm clouds outside â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª And I play classical music
when it rains â™ª

â™ª I play country
when I am in pain â™ª

â™ª But I won't play Beethoven
if the mood's just not right â™ª

â™ª I feel like Hank Williams
tonight â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª There's no explanation â™ª

â™ª Not even a reason â™ª

â™ª No talk
of the good times we had â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Was it me? Was it her? â™ª

â™ª I don't know for sure â™ª

â™ª And that's why
I'm feeling so bad â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª I play jazz
when I am confused â™ª

â™ª I play country
whenever I lose â™ª

â™ª Bergh's saxophone,
it just don't seem right â™ª

â™ª I feel like Hank Williams
tonight â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Well, lately,
I've been thinking â™ª

â™ª I just might quit drinking â™ª

â™ª Now I don't know all in all â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª I just might stay home
and get drunk all alone â™ª

â™ª And punch a few holes
in the wall â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª 'Cause when I'm real high
I play rock 'n roll â™ª

â™ª I play country
when I'm losing control â™ª

â™ª I don't play Chuck Berry
but as much as I'd like â™ª

â™ª I feel like Hank Williams
tonight â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª I feel like Hank Williams
tonight â™ª

(applause, whistling)

Thank you, boys.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Open up the churches pass â™ª

â™ª to try to find a window â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Leaving all the ghosts in us â™ª

â™ª to stand in a holy river â™ª

â™ª As your shadow falls on me â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Cast through treasure
of ivory â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Meet me at the snowy plain â™ª

â™ª where we want adventure â™ª

â™ª You will call me by my name â™ª

â™ª A voice made of winter â™ª

â™ª As your shadow falls on me â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Cast through treasure
of ivory â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª As your shadow falls on me â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Cast through haze of memory â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Some will live
and some will die â™ª

â™ª And some will rise to glory â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª I'm no longer asking why â™ª

â™ª I just tell the story â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Holy shadow â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Oh, holy shadow â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Oh, holy shadow â™ª
