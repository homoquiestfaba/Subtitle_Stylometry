[Suspense Music]

[Eli] We are a family.

We are each an arm, a leg, or a hand,

each important and trusted.

We give each other purpose,

and we introduce chaos to
disrupt the banality of this life

to make aware what is truly important.

Why can't I go with you?

Taylor, I told you already.

Karen, will you deal with this, please?

Okay. Taylor, honey,

mommy and dadddy are going on a date.

Uncle Raymond and aunt
Sharon are gonna watch you.

So I have to be stuck here with them?

You're not stuck
here, don't be a victim.

Nobody likes that.

And when you're older,
you'll go on plenty of dates,

just like this one.

Fine.

Taylor, what did I just say?

Don't be a victim.

Right.

In bed before nine.

(TV playing horror movie)

(suspense music)

There should be a gas station coming up.

We'll be fine.

There could be people.

It'll be fine.

(radio playing calm music)

Watch out.
(tires screeching)

(suspense music)

You're alright?

What you're doing out here?

Stuff.

Do you need a ride?

Yeah, why won't you come with us?

Are you guys sure? I don't wanna be a...

Oh no, not at all.

(group talking at a low voice)

(doorbell rings)

(suspense music)

(door opening)

Hey, come on in.

Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

Just straight over there.

They should be here by now.

It will be fine, they've
done this dozens of times.

[Eli] Hey, you okay?

Where are you heading?

Your family must miss you.

Hey man, could you slow down.

You're gonna be alright?

(man in backseat coughing)

Hey man, just-come on.

Pull over.

(man in backseat coughing)

(suspense music)

Isn't someone here
supposed to be asleep by now?

We're not supposed
to have strangers over

when mom and dad are not home.

These aren't strangers, honey.

They're family.

Come on, go to bed.

(suspense music)

It's a creepy mask.

Oh, don't run.

You won't get far.

(bone smashing)


(suspense music)

(car breaking)

(Eli) Take it.

What the hell happened?

Nothing. We're here.

Taylor's asleep?

Of course.

We should get started.

We are a family.

We are each an arm, a leg, or a hand.

Each important and trusted.

We give each other purpose

and we introduce chaos to disrupt
the banality of this life,

to make aware where is truly important.

And as families do, we grow.

But not all at once,

but with careful selection.

And today, we have one more.

To usher in new blood,

we must spill old blood.

For you cannot take

what you cannot give.

So let us rise as a group

and support our sister.

(suspense music growing)

(knife cutting)

(blood gushing)

[Karen] Taylor?

(door banging)

(knocking on door)

Taylor?

Open up, I can explain.

(knocking on door)

I need you to be a big girl
and open up the door, okay?

(forcing door to open)

You weren't supposed to see that.

Taylor,

sunny,

baby,

we're a family,

all of us.

Everyone that you saw down there,

they wanna protect you.

We get rid of bad people.

We all love you, Taylor.

But for now, you have to
keep this a secret, alright?

You can't tell anyone, do you understand?

And remember, never act like a victim,

and you never will be one.

(high-intensity suspense music)

(suspense music)

How can we not know?

That's not how this works, figure it out.

Why can't I go?

Taylor, you're too young.

I already know everything though.

There's a difference between
knowing about something

and actually participating in it.

I understand that, I
just think it's stupid.

Yeah, me too.

Go.

This entire situation is just sad.

Now, someone else is pretending to be us.

What happened to you guys?

(indistinct conversation)

[Eli] She's not wrong.

She's 12.

She's already seen everything,
she knows everything.

At this point, what's the difference?

She's just a child, Eli.

She's already rationalizing
things the same level we are,

we might as well involve her.

This isn't a debate.

These people pretending to be us,

they killed a child.

We can't just use her,

don't you get how wrong that is?

(door squeaking)

(suspense music)

(knocking on door)

I'm sorry, mister.

I got locked out of my house
and my parents aren't home,

and I just really need to
use the phone to call them.

Can I come in?

Thanks.

(phone dialing)

(ringing tone)

(voicemail message playing)

I can try again in a minute.

You know, it must be really scary,

on your own this late.

Specially with everything
that's been happening, you know?

That poor girl.

Yeah. I guess it is pretty scary.

I wouldn't wanna be the
person who did that.

They're gonna be in trouble.

Well, the cops don't
even know who it is.

Well, cops don't.

(knocking on door)

Fuck.

They say imitation is the
highest form of flattery.

But copycats are different.

They're cowards, and plus,
you got it all wrong.

We don't kill children.

(knife plunging)

This is gonna be bad.

(knife plunging)

I'm gonna tell you this one
time and you are gonna listen.

You don't ever, ever, do that again.

This whole thing, everything
that we have and are, it's me.

You don't change the plan,
you don't say a word,

unless I tell you to.

(high-intensity suspense music)

(playful, mysterious music)

Smooth, eh?

(suspense music)

Are you sure no one's here?

I promise.

(Taylor laughs)

Shit, get down.

You're so lame.

That's right, I can't help it.

Maybe we should just go.

No, Taylor, Taylor, come
on, I was just kidding.

And I'm sorry. Look, it's fine.

It's fine. Come on.

(lustful, mysteriouus music)

You ever just wish
things were different?

I mean, like, I wish that I
could teleport or something.

Oh, or not live in a dorm.

No, like, you ever wish you
were just somewhere different?

Like you could do whatever you want,

not have to answer to anyone,

or follow anyone's rules?

Yeah?

I mean,

I get that.

But here we are together.

Plus, if you were somewhere else then

where would I be right now?

Maybe you're right.

Maybe I have you right where I want you.

You know I like you a lot.

(abrupt blast)

I thought you said they were gone.

I did, they were, they are.

Obviously not.

Let's just hide in here
until they go to sleep.

(door squeaking open)

I'm glad we're here.

Yeah?

It's just my family is
really important to me.

That's kind of a weird thing to say.

(abrupt blast)

What the fuck?

Fuck. Taylor, what the fuck is going on?

I can't help it.

You said you want
things to be different.

I can't be.

I can't be.

I thought we had something.

Taylor, I didn't even tell
my parents where I am.

Taylor, this is what we came here for.

Taylor.

Taylor.

(loud banging)

You do not walk away from me.

Listen man,

my dad will pay you, I swear.

He'll give you whatever you want,

however much you want.

(knife plunging)

Do it.

Now.

This isn't up to you.

(boy sobbing)

(knife falling)

(high-intensity suspense music)

This whole night was for you.

I planned this for you,

and you turn your back on your family.

And for what?

I thought we were over this
rebellious teenager thing.

You do not get to decide who you are.

I do.

(Taylor mumbles)

What?

I can do better, I'll do better.

Then do it.

(high-intensity suspense music)

(phone vibrating)

(phone ringtone)

[Teenage boy] Hey.

Hey, do you guys wanna come over?

Yeah, totally.

My parents are gone.

(suspense music)


[Narrator] The last reported
Sunny killing was in 2015,

in the northern Iowa town of Bettendorf.

(mellow guitar music)

Crazy thing is, they're still out there.

Whatever. Just an urban
legend they tell kids,

so they don't do anything
crazy on April Fool's.

No, my parents actually
told me it was real.

If I was that guy, I
would just kill them all.

That's why you carry a gun on you, guys.

Dude, what are you talking about?

You don't own a gun.

Yeah, guns are super lame anyway.

No, you're right, yeah.

Guns are lame.

Good thing though, I don't
need a gun to protect you.

Ew, no.

So, truth or dare guys?

Whoa, can I go first,

can I go first?

That's so lame.

No, let's do it.

Okay, I'll go first.

Taylor, truth or dare?

Dare.

I dare you to do seven
minutes of heaven with me.

You don't have to do that.

No, it's fine. I want to. This way.

Okay.

(mellow music)

Whoa, you're pretty aggressive.

You know I actually like
you, I'm not just trying to-

Stop lying, okay? Just shut up.

Sorry.

It's okay.

This game sucks.


He's dead.

That's not even funny.

I think it is.

This isn't cool man.

(suspense music)

He's dead.

He's really dead.

(loud bang)
Oh my God.

What's going on?

(Blond guy) No idea.

Oh shit. Jessa?

Oh my God.

Dude, we've gotta fucking go, we gotta go.

Fuck. Shit. Dude.

We need to get the fuck outta here,

Taylor has lost her mind.

(suspense music growing)

What the fuck?

(knife plunging)

(blond guy screams)

(Teenage boy) Come one Taylor,

you don't have to do this.

I know, it's just so
much fucking fun, though.

It just sucks 'cause you are kinda cute.

I feel bad to you, you're like
the only cool one in your ...

I'll still be the cool one.

What if you joined us?

We're like a family.

People say it's a cult
but it's more of a family.

We could have so much fun together.

Plus, I know you like me.

I do. I really do like you.

I know you do.

Taylor, we gotta go get the cops,

we can fix this, this will be fine.

What a bummer.

(knife plunging multiple times)

(blood gushing)

(suspense music)

Taylor, I told you,

strangle, don't stab.

You never listen.

Stabbing is so much more fun, though.

[Man] Looks like we are
gonna need a lot more bleach.

I did good though, right?

You did good, you're a real
part of the family now, honey.

You know what?

Maybe we should do a family portrait.

Let's.
