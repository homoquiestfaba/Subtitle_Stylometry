Boy, talk about
your lucky puppet.

I'd give anything if
only I could become

a real live boy
like that pinocchio.

Aah!

Is that what
you wish for

above all other things,
dear spot?

Oh, yes,
dear blue fairy.

Being a real
live boy

is the most
important thing

in the whole
wide world to me.

Then close your eyes
very tightly,

dear spot,

and wish for it
with all your heart.

I wish I was a boy.


I wish
I was a boy.


I wish
I was a--


Ow, you're
hurting me,

dear blue fairy.

(Man's Voice)
I ain't no fairy!

And it's time to get up.

Sorry, pretty boy.

It's just that
I was having

the most
wonderful dream.

Him with the dream again.

It's not enough
you dress up like a boy

and go to that
cockamamie school every day!

No. "I want to be a boy.
I want to be a boy."

Well, wise up, pupchik!

I want to be a rooster
in a henhouse,

but I don't see it
happenin'!

Although I'd be
a darn good one,

wouldn't I,
Mr. Jolly?

Ohhh...la.
It's a bit early in the day

for hypothetical
speculations,

but...you? A rooster?


It is to laugh.

Who asked you,
tuna breath?

You're still in bed?!

Come on, get up.
You don't want to be late

for the last day
of school, do you?

And ruin my perfect
attendance record?

I don't think so.

Come on, let's go!

Pants?
Check.

Shirt?
Check.

Tail.
Tucked.

Eyebrows?
Plucked!

Ears in cap?

Ooh, a table scrap.

Chow?
Demolished.

Apple?
Polished!

World, here I come! Ha!

Congratulations,
scott leadready ii,

on winning the fourth grade
perfect attendance medal!

Thank you,
Mrs. Helperman.

It's just the thing
to compliment

my math medal,
history medal,

and science medal,
not to mention

my medal for
self-esteem. Ohh!

Well, it's been
a gosh darned

jubilatious joy
teaching you!

And all of you.
Uhh!


I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

I'm just
going to Miss you...

All so much.

(All Sobbing)

I told you a million times,

no hugs at school!

Oh, sorry, doodlebug.

I mean...
Dude, don't bug me.

Anyhoo, what yummy,
fun plans

does everyone have
for this summer?

I'm going
to my granny smith's

granny smith
apple farm.

All: WE'RE SKATIN' 24/7.

I'm grounded for a week

for hacking into
buckingham palace.

But after that, I get
to visit my uncle ivan,

who does strange and
disgusting experiments

on animals and people.
I mean, who knows?

Maybe next time
I see you guys,

I'll be able to breath
through my neck

like an amphibian!

Aah!

You're so weird, ian.

Wait'll you see me
with gills!

Heh! Hottie!


Ahh! This summer.

Yeah, I know
what I'm doin'--

just playin'
with my best friend.

Hey! Aah!

Yeah, best friends
forever.


Calm down, angel eyes.

Now, poppy can't make
his announcement

with your sharp
little talons

in his adam's apple!


Now, students
of the, uh, um....

Fourth grade,
principal strickler.

to be fifth grade!

That's why I'm glad
I'm a principal.

None of this messy
student/teacher involvement.

They grow, they leave--
good riddance.

But I suppose it is
just that sort of

bushy-gushy loving
teacher stuff

that leads to this
announcement. Hmph!

Mrs. Mary lou helperman,

you have been selected
as a finalist

for the teacher
of the year award!

(All Cheering)

Neato!

That's right,
it's the NE.A.T.O.--

the national excellent

american teacher
organization award!

Leonard:
Way to go, mom!

And that's not all,
mary lou helperman!

As a finalist,

the fala d. Roosevelt
unified school district

will be sending you
to compete

in the final round
of competition

in beautiful sunny
southern Florida!

Florida!

And the fun doesn't end
there, mary lou helperman.

Oh, no. Because
you'll be travelling

to the sunshine state
in the luxury

of my very own personal
air-conditioned wentawaygo!

Yes, it's all yours.

<i>Mi wentawaygo</i>
<i>es su wentawaygo.</i>

I only have one,
uh, heh...

Little, tiny,
very simple rule--

certainly,
principal strickler.

Absolutely no dogs
are allowed

in my wentawaygo, ever!

<i>I hate dogs!</i>


(Music Playing)


Well, I guess this is
the time to say good-bye.

Oh, come on,
don't make it harder.

Don't give me
those big, sad dog eyes.

They're the only eyes
I got, leonard.

The eyes of a dog--

a dog who's not
going anywhere.

Just staying home...

By himself...

Here...alone!

The dog.

But you're not
going to be alone.

You've got pretty boy
and jolly,

and Mrs. Boogin's the nicest
pet-sitter in the whole world.

And besides,
it's only for 2 weeks.

Yeah, in boy-time, 2 weeks,

but everything in dog-time
is 7 times longer,

so for me it's 14 weeks.

as well be forever.

Man, this really stinks.

You should smell it
from down here.

Ok, just 2 weeks,
then I'm back,

and it's you and me,
best friends,

together,
all summer long.

Aw, jeez, you're gonna
sing now, aren't you?

â™ª I Know
It's been said â™ª

Spot: OH, BOY.

â™ª Everyone
Needs someone â™ª

This is not
making it better.

â™ª A Loyal Companion â™ª

â™ª To Share
In life's fun â™ª

You're
killing me here.

â™ª For A Day
At the park â™ª

â™ª Or A Game
Of leap frog â™ª

Sing it with me, spot.

I thought
you'd never ask.

â™ª A Friend Needs A Friend â™ª

â™ª A Boy Needs A Dog â™ª

Leonard! Come on,
lenny-bones, hop in!

Let's skit-skat-skedoodle!

Florida's not gonna
come to us, you know?

Mwah!

Bye, spotty-wots!
Be a good doggie!

(Vroom, Screech)

(Sad Violin playing)

Whoa!

(Tires Screeching)

Don't forget your sun block.

<i>Woman on TV: JOHN?</i>

<i>Man on TV: MARCIA?</i>

<i>John!</i>

<i>Marcia!</i>

<i>John!</i>

<i>Marcia!</i>

Yawn! Mush-a!

<i>John?</i>

<i>Marcia?</i>

with no lives

are watching
<i>the barry anger show!</i>

Aah!
Aah!

Hi, I'm barry anger,

and today on the hot seat,
we have Dr. Ivan krank,

a world-class wacko who--
get this--

claims he can turn animals
into human beings!

Huh? Turn animals
into human beings?

My dream come true!

Oh, now how did this trash
get on my tv?

Where's my clicker?

Oh, for goodness sakes,
where did I put that?

Hey!

Oh, silly me, I must have
left it in the kitchen.

Well, good excuse to get
us all some more yummies!

Moochie poochie!

God love her for the food,
but that woman is definitely

a couple of caraways
short of a seed bell.

Shh! Look!

Direct from Florida,
where the cuckoo nuts grow,

the world's biggest wacko,
Dr. Ivan krank!

I am not a wacko!

I am a man of science,
who has perfected

the neuro-electrical,
photo-pulsar-based

methodology to isolate
the genome on the dna strand

which will allow me
to transform dumb animals

into dumb human beings--
just like you!

Wow, it's
my dream come true!


(Clap Clap)

<i>Audience:</i>
<i>Wacko! Wacko! Wacko!</i>

Wacko! Wacko! Wacko!

No! You are the wackos

if you don't believe
that the possibilities

for change in this world
are infinite!

And I'll prove it!

As soon as I find
the perfect animal subject

to turn into
a real live human being!

Me, Dr. Krank, me!

Hey, smart boy, let me
explain how tv works.

We can hear them,
but they can't hear us.



I've got to meet that man.

He's the one chance
I have to finally make

my lifelong dream
come true!

But he's all the way
in Florida

where leonard and his mom
are headed right now!

What a coinkidink.

Coinkidink, Mr. Jolly?
Coinkidink?

That I just happened
to lay on that clicker

and change to that channel
and see that miracle man

who just happens
to live in Florida

where leonard
and his mom

just happen to be
going as we speak?

Coinkidink, Mr. Jolly...
Or fate?

Cover for me with
the pet-sitter, guys.

I'm goin' to Florida!


Aah! Cover with
the pet-sitter?

But how?
We have no experience!

And we have no time
to prepare! Oh, dear me!

Oh, this is bad.
This is very bad.

How will we ever
pull it off? Oh!

<i>â™ª La La La La â™ª</i>

Ooh!

Oh, mercy, spot!

I almost sat on you!

Do you love mommy?

I think we can
handle it.




(Music Playing)

Come on, leonard,
let's play a game.

"20 questions." I'll start.
Here's your hint.

It's someone you love.


What? Spot?

Wow, good guess!

No, I saw him!
With my own eyes!

Oh, you want to play
that game. Ha ha ha!

All righty, I spy
with my little eye--

spot!

No, come on, honey,

spot can't be
the answer every time.

(Dramatic Music playing)



Mom, you gotta stop!

Ooh, ooh, you're right.
We do. We need gas.



Ok, you fill 'er up, sweetie.
I've got to go powder my nose.

Cleanliness is next
to godliness,

but gas station
bathrooms are not.

Spot? Spot?
Where are you?



Oh, no...

Lose something, bunky?

Spot! Ha!

You're ok!
I can't believe it!

What are you
doing here?

I had to come, lenny!
How could I stay away?

I just love you so much

and wanted to be
with you so bad.

A friend needs a friend.

A boy needs a dog.

Ok, I also need
a lift to Florida

for my own self-serving
reasons, but why spoil

this beautiful moment
with that?

I love ya!
I want to be with ya!

Mmm, give us
another hug!

Oh, spot, good ol' boy!

Hey, wait a second.
Are you crazy?

You heard what
principal strickler said

about no dogs
in his wentawaygo.

And here comes
my mom right now!

What are
we gonna do, spot?

Spot?

Did you
just say spot?

No, Mrs. Helperman,
he said scott!

As in
scott leadready ii,

your old pal
from back home!

Who'da thunk it and
fancy meeting me here.

He's good.

Oh, scott,
I've missed you.

Really, Mrs. H?
How much?

Enough to take me on
the rest of your trip

to sunny southern
Florida? Heh heh!

Could we, mom?

Well, of course not, honey.

Scott's obviously
traveling with his family.

What family?
Oh! My family!

Sure, I'm traveling
with my family.

My whole family--
mom, sis, grandma,

uncle jojo,
the ventriloquist,

his dummy floyd--

my family!
Ooh, I love 'em!

I love 'em,
but darn the luck,

wouldn't you know,

they can't
go to Florida,

because--
because why?

There's been
an emergency?

Good. I mean,
it's a good emergency.

The kind where
they all have to go home,

but I can still
go to Florida with you.

Which is the good part,

so, come on,
let's hit the road!

Well, hmm, I'd certainly
need to discuss it

with your mother first.

Oy, you don't
make this easy.

She'll meet you
right over there.

<i>She just, uh,</i>
<i>has to get dressed.</i>



Ooh, jeez!

What I have to go through
to become a real live boy!

Ooh!

<i>Spot:</i>
<i>Why, mary lou helperman!</i>

<i>Hello and halleloo!</i>

Ha ha ha!

If you weren't just
sent from heaven above

to take our dear
little scott to flor--

I'm sorry to interrupt,
Mrs. Leadready,

but do you want to hear
the funniest thing?

I brought that exact
same dress on this trip.

Oh, that is funny.
You're a stitch!

Anyway,
back to poor scott.

He so desperately
wants to go to Florida.

And I believe I packed that
same shade of lipstick, too!

Really?
What a coinkidink!

Anyway,
as I was saying--

and those earrings
look awfully familiar.

Are you gonna take him
or not?! Darlin'.

Well, gee,

shouldn't we check with
the rest of your family?

Oy. The rest of my--

I'll see
who's round the corner!

Yeah, yeah,
I tell ya--

thanks, gals.

please take scott

to sunny
southern Florida,

so I can
have some peace

from all his
merciless teasing!

Young lady, I missed
my chance to see Florida

when I was the boy's age,

and look what a bitter old
woman I turned out to be!

You must be scott's--

I can't talk to you!
I'm too bitter!

(Irish Accent)
Hoity-toity-toity-toity-toi.

An' 'tis wishin' I am
that some fine soul

would take me scotty boy
to Florida.

Uncle jojo
the ventriloquist?

'Tis!

And where's
your dummy floyd?

Great St. Patty's
shillelagh!

The little leprechaun must
be around here somewhere.

Ok, you be floyd.

Me? I don't know
what to do!

Just shut up
and act dumb!

What?
Perfect!

Mrs. Helperman,
meet dummy floyd.

Take our scott, please!

Oh, ha ha ha! Ohh,
leonard's gotta see this.

Where'd he go?
And where's scott?

Oh, I'll find 'em,
colleen,

providin' you'll
hie me fine nephew

to fair Florida.

Well, of course,
I'll take him!

I've been planning
to take him all along.

And you couldn't
have just said that

to the lady in
the flowery dress?

Saints preserve us!
Say good-bye, floyd!

Top o'
the mornin' to ya!

Hey, I do the cliched
irish dialogue around here.

So, whassup?
So, whassup?

Well, scott, it looks like

you're coming with us
to Florida!

Yes!
Yes!

I'm on my way
to Florida!

Come on, everyone!
Time's a-wastin'!

Let's hit the road
and sing a song about it!

What is it with
this family and singing?

I'm starting to feel
von trapped.

I could get used

Oh, no, but I can't.

I'll be late

Stay near the lifeguard.

We do?
What's your dream?

Well, heh heh heh,

I guess maybe I should've
mentioned it earlier,

but see,
there was this...

(Waves Crash)

...And changed
to that...

(Music Blaring)

...And concerned...

(Bird Squawk,

And that's the real reason
I had to come to Florida.

Oh. I get it.

I thought you came
to be with me,

but you really just
came for the ride.

No, I <i>did</i> come
to be with you...

And for the ride.

Aw, please, lenny!

I gotta have a shot
at my dream.

I don't know.

It all sounds
so wacko.

Anyway, you're not
supposed to be a boy.

You're supposed
to be my dog.


Oh, don't give me
the eyes.

No, not the sad
walk away.

Forget it. No.


Oh, all right.

We'll find
this Dr. Krank guy.

But as soon as you see
that I'm right

and he's nuts,

we'll march
right back here,

you'll be a dog,
I'll throw a stick,

and we'll make

But why is barry anger

Why, you ask,
am I returning my spotlight

to that wacko?

I'll let officer white

of the okeebachokee bureau
of animal safety explain.

Dr. Ivan krank
is a dangerous fraud.

His experiments did not
turn animals human at all.

They turned them into
hideous, weird mutations

like this!

Aaah!
Ohhh!

We have to go
to Florida!

Why?

To keep spot from
being turned into that!

Ohhh!

This is no time

screaming silently.
Come on!

Florida?!
Florida's outside!

I'm an indoor kitty.

Both: WOW.

Look at all
the high-techy-tech!

Ah ha ha!
I can't stand it!

â™ª I'm Gonna Be A Boy â™ª

Ooh!


<i>Spot: 665?</i>

Oh, it must be the next one
down that-a-way.

Heh heh heh.

Florida--
land of surprises.

Trust me, fellas.
It's a great gig.

24-Hour a day soaps,

all the food
you can eat--

where else are you gonna
get a deal like that?

(All Mutter "I don't know")

Oh, spot!

And pretty boy!

And Mr. Jolly!

Come on in, boys.

There's fresh food
in the kitchen.

Her heart's in
the right place,

but, boy, could she use
a new set of bifocals.

Come on, jolly,
let's roll.

Are we there yet?

Oh!

Small but mighty.

Say it with me, baby!


(Spot Reading)

<i>Spot: WELL,</i>
<i>He means business.</i>

This can't be it.

Dr. Krank:
This is it!

After this
experiment succeeds,

the world
will never again

call me wacko!

(Teeth Chattering)

And that
includes you...

Mommy!

Uhh!




I have done it!

Success, at long last!

I have taken a frog,
and made it...

Moo.


I have failed again.

See? He's nuts.
It doesn't work.

Come on, let's go.

Well, of course it
doesn't work on a frog.

Hello? It's
a lower life form.

Moo.

No offense.

None taken.

Dennis! Adele!

Get in here now
and help me destroy

this stupid,
worthless machine!

Don't call it stupid,
daddy.

You made us with it.

And where is
the glory in that?

And don't call me
daddy!

You are not
my children.

You're nothing
but a couple

of mutant
swamp creatures

who do nothing
but remind me

of my life
of failure!

Just 'cause you're
having a bad day,

is it really necessary
to dump on everyone else?

Yes, we may be
failures,

but we're failures
who love you.

Out of my way,
you walking handbag!


<i>Spot: UM, HELLO?</i>

Who is that?

Heh.

Jeez, he looked
a lot shorter on tv.

Maybe it's the ax.

Allow me
to introduce myself.

I am
scott leadready ii,

your newest subject.

The one that's
finally going to work!

Dare you torment
an old man?

You cannot help me!
Aah!

You're nothing but
a worthless boy!

You're wrong, Dr. Krank.

I am a dog who wants
to be a worthless boy.

I mean, who wants
to be a boy.


Good lord,
I was totally fooled.

Don't worry.
Happens all the time.

Now, here's your problem
as I see it, doc.

While your theories
are scientifically sound

and your equipment
technically flawless,

you keep hitting
a failure point

when it comes
to the selection

of your
subjects.

See, you've been
experimenting

on swamp
creatures,

insects, and,
uh, reptiles.

And all-ee-gators!

All-ee-gators
<i>are</i> reptiles.

Proceed.

Mm-hmm. But
the fact is, Dr. Krank,

if you want
to make a man,

you've got to start
with a mammal!

Yes. Of course.
It's so simple,

and yet so utterly
brilliant!

Ha ha ha!

I wish I had a nickel

for every time
I've heard that.

I shall give you
a nickel...

If you will be
my mammal.

I'll take it!

Then I shall
make you a boy.

Oh, boy!

Oh, no!

Spot, this is wrong.

<i>This is going</i>
<i>against nature.</i>

Nature? Feh!

I am a man
of science!

You're a wacko
of science!

Who do you think
you are?

I'll tell you
who I am.

Or, better yet,
I'll sing it!

Maestro,

a tango,
if you please.

<i>I'm a boy! I'm a boy!</i>

I'm a really big boy.

You're not

You're a man.

I'm a man?

I don't understand.

How could I be
a man?

Great balls
of kibble!

I forgot
all about dog time!

That's right!

One human year
equals seven dog years.

That would make you...

Don't do the math.


Uh, it's not exactly
what I had planned,

but I'm human,

and that's nothing
to shake your tail at.

How can I thank you?

Oh, it will be
thanks enough

that you spend
the rest of your life

traveling around
the world with me

as living proof
of my genius!

Ah. Well, uh, gee,

fun as that sounds
for me,

I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to pass.

I can't spend the rest
of my life with you.

I--i--i live
with this guy...

At his house, in his room.

I sleep on the bottom bunk.

Heh. Although, now that
I'm a big, grown man

with knuckle hair and--
uhh--lower back pain,

that may present
a slight problem.

But we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

Let's go, leonard!

No!

Aah!


You're not
going anywhere,

my precious man.

I made you, I own you.

You're mine!
Come, dennis, adele!

We must begin

Get down!


(Both Gasp)

Boy: HI, UNCLE IVAN!

The bus from
east westland

was a little late,
but here I am!

Ian?


Leonard?
What are you doing

in my uncle's
laboratory?

And who are you,
Mister,

and why are you
all dressed up

like
scott leadready ii?

Uh, no time to explain,
strange little boy

I've never met after
in my life.

Ian, can you help us
get out of here?

What'll you give me
if I do?

Um, all I've got
is this, uh,

slimy old dog chew toy

and a shiny new nickel.

Mm-hmm. Ohh...

Holding out on me,
huh?

Hey, give me
that chew toy!

(Growls And laughs)

Ok, let's see now.

Decode secret password,

override security check,

bypass concealed

and...bingo!

(Doors Clang open)

Wow!

How did you
do that?

Oh, come on.
This was easy.

Reprogramming

Thanks, ian.

Uhh!

Hmm. I must work out.

Come on, scott!
Scott!

Hey, wait for me!

Old habits die hard.

<i>Dr. Krank:</i>
<i>They've escaped!</i>

Dennis, adele,
find them!

You betcha!

Right away, daddy.

Hmm. Nothing here.

Hmm.

Not in here,
you fools.

Out there!

<i>Hurry!</i>

Yes, sir, daddy.

Uhh!

And don't call me daddy!

How could a man
as brilliant as I

have created something
as stupid as them?

I can't believe they let
my dog-man escape!

Oh, don't blame
them, uncle ivan.

I let 'em go.

Ah! Ian!

Ahh! Ian,
my darling nephew,

the only one who ever
truly believed in me.

Welcome to my home!

However, now that
you've ruined everything,

I must ground you for
the rest of the summer.

So go to your room.
Don't come out till labor day!

Yes, uncle ivan.

Grounded again.

Jeez, I could've saved
a bus ride.

What was I so afraid of
all these years?

The outside
is very nice.

Pleasant, even.
One might go so far

as to say
invig-amarating.

Told ya.

But we're not going
very fast.

How long will it take us
to get to spot?

Oh, we should

some real progress
any second now.

Bo-o-o-oard!


Aaaaah!

Man, I'm gettin'
hungry.

Yeah, me, too.

And if these pants
ride up any more,

I'm gonna be

I gotta get me
some new clothes.

(Both Sigh)

We need to get us
some money.

Yeah, but how?

Whoa!

What?

(Both Reading)

That'll do.
That'll do.

Come on, let's go
find that dog

and get us some money!

How?

The twilight bark.

The what?

Uhh!

Oh, we gotta start

Gee, I can think

Oh, uh, I can't

You brought back 5 dogs!

What?!

Who are you, sir?

That.

Oh, yeah.

Well, I'll tell ya.

Well, you certainly
look familiar.

Wait a ding-dang-

You're not one of

competition, are you?

Uh, why, yes.
Yes I am.

(Deep Voice)
Uh, I am a teacher.

And a darn good one, too,

who appreciates a fellow
darn good teacher enough

to come all the way
down here

to this lovely
wentawaygo park to say,

"may the best
darn good teacher win."

Well, isn't that
kind of you?

Honey,
where's scott?

Uh...
And, uh...

That's the other reason
I came.

Uh, to tell you
that, uh...

Scott's family called,

and he had to go home
after all,

and he needed
a grownup to help,

and I obviously
am a grown-up...

Human man person.

Ahh! Obviously.

Ah ha ha! You know
scott leadready ii?

Do I know
scott leadready ii?

Only better
than I know myself, ma'am.

You're

Well, any friend

Great gettin' to know you.
Just a little,

but not too much.
Bye.

Leonard! Where did you
park your manners?

Ha ha ha.
After all the trouble

Mr. Manly-manning
has gone to,

the least we can do
is invite him in

for a cup of coffee.

Coffee?

I've always wanted
to try coffee.

Boy, it's true what they say!
What a beverage!

Who'd believe that little
brown bean from brazil

could pack such mellow,
rich-roasting,

good-to-the-last-drop flavor?
By the way,

were you aware that
IT WAS OUR 26th PRESIDENT--

theodore "teddy" roosevelt--

who originally coined
the phrase
"good to the last drop"?

Little-known fact, but true.

Yes, I think
one of my students

mentioned that once.
I can't remember which one.

You can't remember
which one?

For cryin' out loud,
it's obviously--

time for you to go now.
What a shame.

Thanks for stopping by.
See you later.

Hey! What's
the hurry, junior?

I'm still on
my first cup of joe.

Ahh, what can I say?

<i>There's something about</i>
<i>eating under the stars</i>

Well, to me,
it's not the food,

it's the company.
Heh heh heh.

but it's as if

I've known you for
a very long time.

Hey, nothin' I love more

Woof!

Uh, to wear, I mean.

Ah ha ha ha ha!

You say the most
unusual things.

But I like it.

Golly gosh,
I wish there was

someone like you
back home.

You do?

Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

Well...

He did drink
a lot of coffee.

Big Scott: LEONARD!

You are gonna be
so proud of me!

We can stop worrying
how I'm gonna live

and where
I'm gonna sleep

and how we're gonna
stay together.

I've stumbled upon
the answer,

and it doesn't
even matter

that I'm
a hairy-knuckled grownup

with back pain.

Ooch!

In fact, it works
to our advantage!

You're kidding!

Of course,
I won't be sleeping

at the bottom bunk
anymore,

but I promise
I'll tuck you in

and tell you
a bedtime story

after I settle in

to watch the 9:00
news with...

Mary lou.

Who?

You know. Your mom.

Oh, he cleaned his plate
so well.



I know who
mary lou is,

but why would you be
watching the news with her?

And why is she dancing around
with your dinner plate?

Unless...

(Electric Guitar playing

(Pants And barks)

Oh, no!

Oh, yes!

Isn't it perfect?

She likes me,

I've always
loved her.

You and I still
get to be together.

Climb up on my lap,
sonny boy,

and call me daddy!

Are you crazy?

You can't be my dad!
You're my dog!

Hey, people change.

Come on,
it'll be great.

<i>I'll teach you</i>
<i>how to shave,</i>

<i>take you fishing,</i>

<i>holler at your</i>
<i>little league coach</i>

<i>when he doesn't</i>
<i>play you enough.</i>

Maybe I'll even get ya
a little puppy.

Mister, you are
out of control.

What? You gonna
send me to my room?

I think that's
my job, son.

No! No, this is
not ok with me.

You have to stop
liking my mom right now!

Oh, in all
fairness, son,

I believe mary lou
should have

something to say
about this.

And stop calling her
mary lou!

And stop calling me son!

I command you,
as your master!

<i>Former</i> master,
leonard!

I'm not your dog
anymore!

Well, I sure as heck
am not your kid!

So maybe you'd just
better leave me

and my mom alone!

You...want me to go?

But...what about us?

You and me?

A friend
needs a friend.

That was
a different us.

Yeah.
I guess it was.

Wait a minute.

Yeah?

I paid for that collar
and dog tag

with my own allowance.

But...

You don't need 'em.

You said it yourself.

â™ª Where Did You Go,
Dog-man? â™ª

â™ª Where Did You Go,
Dog-man? â™ª

â™ª He's Gone â™ª

Well,
that was strange.

<i>(Ride Of the valkyries</i>
playing)

(Both Scream)

Aaah!

Whoa--


Aaaah!
Aaaah!

Ohh!
Ohh!

<i>Pretty Boy:</i>
<i>We made it.</i>

<i>We made it!</i>

Florida at last!

I told you we were
small but mighty!

<i>Man: HEH HEH HEH.</i>

(Speaking Spanish)

Missed it
by t<i>hat m</i>uch.

<i>Boy: SPOT,</i>
<i>Come here, boy!</i>

Leonard?




Aww...

Now, remember,
lenny-benny-beanbag,

you're to meet me
at the awards ceremony

at 6:00 sharp,
you got it?

Whatever.

Aww,
honey-bunny-boombox,

I know you Miss your dog
and your best friend,

but we're going home
tomorrow,

and spot and scott'll be
there waitin' for you,

and everything's gonna
be peachy-pie normal

and just the way
it was. Mwah!

Right.
Just the way it was.



(Both Grunt)

Florida, schmorida!

It's just jersey
with palm trees!

Well, I suppose
most people

don't arrive
by garbage truck.

On a more positive note,

I don't think there's
anything in the world

I'll ever fear
after this.

It's a monster!


Hey!

It's just
your reflection.

Oh. Aah!

It's me!
I look hideous!


No argument there.

I'm goin' up for
a bird's-eye view.

(Music Playing)

Dog-man!

Where are you?



My, oh, me,

it's
a rain-a-roony-doodle day!

Whoo-hoo!

Bada-bing, baby!


Come on, hairball!


Great. Now you're
out there somewhere

in the stupid rain

'cause you just couldn't

leave well enough alone,
could you?

No, you had to go
mess up a great thing

just to make
your stupid dream come true.

Bet you come crawling back
any minute now,

cold and wet
and tired and hungry

and sick of being a man

and wishing you could be
my dog again.

Well, forget it!
I'm not taking you back.

(Knock On door)


Ha ha!

<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

"Oh, it's you"?

We traveled
2,000 miles,

and all we get is,
"oh, it's you"?!

Come on, jolly,
let's go home!

What?!

No, you guys.
I'm sorry.

I'm really, really
glad you're here.

I've never needed
anyone more.

Now, <i>that's</i>
a greeting.

Something's happened
to spot.

Sit down.
It's a long story.

(Blues Playing)

So this is what it's like
to be human, huh?

Sittin' alone in a dump
on your tailless butt,

just twiddlin'
your opposable thumbs.

Top of the world, ma!



Top of the world.

(Harmonica Playing)

What's that?

Sounds like
that stupid song

leonard always
used to sing.

<i>Oh, it</i> is
<i>that stupid...</i>

Beautiful song!

Oh, leonard.

you gotta let him

Yeah.
Yeah.

I know what

There's only one way
for us to be together again.

I've gotta go
to Dr. Krank

into a dog!

Yeah!
Yeah!

What?!
What?!

See ya, guys!

No! Wait!
No! Wait!

Bunky, I'm back!

Pretty boy? Jolly?
What are you doing here?

Who is that strange man,
and why is he talking to us?

I don't know.
Just act dumb.

Uh, tweet.

Uhh!
Meow, meow, meow.

Guys, it's me.
It's spot.

Aah!

Oh, my. This is what
you look like as a man?

Why? Is something
wrong with it?

No, no. It was just
a shock at first.

You could use a shave.

Really? I thought
it was kind of edgy.

But forget that.
Where's leonard?

Oh, spot,
it's terrible.

He just ran out
babbling some nonsense

about if
you can't be his dog,

then he'll have to get
that Dr. Krank

to turn him
into your dog.

That crazy kid.

Although I guess
it could work.

No! No!
What am I saying?

I've got to save
my boy!

(Dr. Krank
muttering)


This is perfect--
perfect.

Why, my plan could not
have gone any better...

If I'd had a plan!

And now I do!

I'll turn the boy
into a dog,

<i>use him as bait</i>
<i>to lure the dog man,</i>

and then I'll have
the man and the dog!

Ah ha! Mommy!

Nothing wacko
about that!


Oh, isn't there,
Dr. Wacko?

Ah. You're
right on cue.


Ohh.

You really should've
seen that coming.

Ohh!

I'm sorry, scott.

I just wanted us
to be together again.

I did it for us.

No. I'm the sorry one,
leonard.

It's all my fault.

I shouldn't have
messed with nature.

Oh, haven't you heard?

My good man,
nature is dead.

Science is king!

Oh, that is just wrong
on so many levels.

Well, then riddle me
this, Dr. Krank.

<i>Is it science</i>
<i>or nature</i>

that makes you
have to laugh

when someone tickles you
under the armpits?

Pretty boy, jolly.


Stop it, you guys!

You keep him busy.
I'll take care of krank.

You're too late.

No!


Whoa! Whoa!

Aah!

Oh, my goodness.

What?
What is it?

Do I got spinach
in my teeth?

Big Scott: STOP! WAIT!

Oh! Aah!
Aah!

You are one
butt-ugly man.

Well, I've been under
a little stress lately.

Whoa!

Hey!

Hey! Whoa!
What's happened?

Uh-oh.

<i>Oh, darn.</i>

Wait a minute.
I've still got this.

Thank you, Dr. Krank!

No, no, you fool!

Quarters only!
A nickel will jam it!

You'll blow us all up!

That's a chance
I'll have to take.

(Dramatic Music playing)

<i>Say</i> auf wiedersehen...

Aah!
<i>Wacko.</i>


Aah!

(Squeaks, Grunts)

Uhh!

Cool.

No! No! Help!

Uhh!

Oh, well. To quote
the immortal bard,

which I don't believe
I've yet done

in this entire
adventure,

"all's well
that end's well."

<i>Leonard: SCOTT!</i>
<i>Look out!</i>

(Cracks, Fizzles)

Quick! We got to get out
after it blows!

You go. There's one more
thing I've got to do.

It's my only chance.

Scott,
what are you doing?




(Electricity Crackling)


Scott! Scott!

(Choral Music playing)

Oh, scott.

Stupid machine!

Stupid, stupid science!


(Dramatic Music playing)

Wake up,
dear blue spot.

Wake up.

<i>Spot: OH, IS THAT YOU,</i>
<i>Dear blue fairy?</i>

How many times I got
to tell you, dog breath?

I ain't no fairy!

Spot? Is it really you?

In the fur.

Oh, spot, you're back!

I had to come back,
bunky.

I love ya, and
I want to be with ya.
