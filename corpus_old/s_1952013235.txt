and appears to be a discrepanÃ¾Ã£
between the declaration and I. ..

<i> Thanks. </i>

<i> Hi, my name is Susan Noah. </i>

<i> because I called a friend
It was the link and was wondering ...</i>

Hi. I'm Emily.

Yes, people do the wedding.
Currently, can not receive.

I know someone in the neighborhood
people who do.

Not knowing as well as me,
but preÃ¾uri better.

Hello?

Duke!

Duke!

We're here!

Hello, Miss Posa.
What cauÃ¾i here?

I came to see you on your
I will not sunaÃ¾i before?

I'll have Trend
ascundeÃ¾i to certain things.

That is meat? No! No, no!

No meat! No!

I liked it much.
He mÃ£nÃ¢ncÃ£ boiled broccoli and Tofu.

Why?
Because he's a vegetarian.

He's a vegetarian?
Yes.

What am I bye.

Can we talk? Take a minute?

No. I gotta get on Duke
to walk.

No problem.
Go with you, if you do not bother.

I looked over
Acts of 2005, 2006 and 2007 ...

God ...
Listen.

Let him Ã¾ÃŽÃ± me?
No. I'm fine.

I ride. SimÃ¾iÃ¾i you okay?
Yes.

Sorry.

Sit like a.
Nothing.

Caution!
Sit down!

Maybe I would have to get more meat.

So I looked ...

Can we do this later.
Yes.

So gate before you, see.

No. I don 't know
when I cooked last time.

So are my sister
take care of me from distance.

You have the fellowship?
Yes, a brother. It's a good man.

Yes, and I am just a sister.

Have you received any money from any sursÃ£
that the state does not know how anything?

Lately, I did diving
fÃ¢ntÃ¢nile in local magical, so ...

I mean, do from time to time
but when you find 25 cenÃ¾i ...

In fact ...

I had
to my house refinanÃ¾ez

to get my pay
the last two medical bills.

I was informed that
of a congenital heart defect.

Yes. You learned that while
me at the hospital?

No ...

Now you're in condition 2.

Which means that
disease is quite advanced

how to be on the list supplied data
of waiting,

but not sufficiently advanced as
to be interned and put in state 1.

So, basically, if the disease gets worse
and can not find any donor,

you put it.

Is it true that you said that ...

... nor do I think a heart meriÃ¾i
because life's unnoticed

in all ways possible?

Sorry ...

I do not know why I said that.
Sorry.

I have to take a course of sensitivity
that you hire the exchequer, Mr Thomas?

No. Not really.
Exactly.

So you do not find a good man?

How you answer that question
If you've wondered the same thing?

Unnoticed would be ...

... a Ã®mbunÃ£tÃ£Ã¾ire for me,
I assure you.

We'll freeze accounts
up to us and tiinÃ¾Ã£ri.

I'm sure I'll you so,
five or six months without penalty.

Look at my card.

If you looking for someone to Tax
you to call me immediately.

Well.

Thanks.

Me giving thanks.

Ready.

Sir Thomas!
Yes?

Why do I feel that
I do a big favor now?

Because I feel
that it really meriÃ¾i.

Okay?

Go ...

Are you going to contaminate
dog to someone else now?

No.

I'm going and I home.
Where?

Take care of yourself, Emily.
And you.

What are these things?
You 've said.

Why did you bring a sense in the room?
Because it is my room.

And I do not want to enter one
in my room, you understand each other?

I do not think you can
Ã¾ii's a sense in the room.

I think I will.

I have never had someone
who had a Ã¾inut up in the room.
