(Mr. Newell) As you go forth
on your journey, and lead us

into the next century,
I know that you're going out

into this world and will give
one hundred and ten percent.

You are the best
and you are the brightest.

We could be looking at the
future leaders of this country.

<i>(Gagging sounds)</i>

Writers, senators,
and scientists.

Humanitarians and
heads of industry.

passed since that graduation.

And coming out of continuation
school, I had no clue what we

were gonna do with our lives.

But I knew for sure that none
of us were gonna become senators

or scientists.
Just ain't gonna happen.

Sparky was a wild one,
man. The beauty of Sparky

was that you never knew
where he was comin from.

Who took a dump in my mouth?

off a line of "fuck you's"

better than
anybody I ever heard.

I'm gonna castrate you
and fuck your mother in the

fucking ass with your own
fucking dick. Fuck you!

Shit. Lardo? He was everything
you could've asked for in

a friend. He was funny, he was
charming, had a way with words--


Did pretty good with the chicks

and always seemed to make
light of a serious situation.

pleased to tell you today that

I've signed legislation that
will outlaw Russia forever.

We begin bombing
in five minutes.

<i>(Screams)</i>

Together, we were one.

I mean, we had it all.

At least I thought we did.

And every summer, we'd
get a visit from Iris.

<i>(Knock on door)</i>

Iris!

<i>(Green)</i>

There's coffee in the kitchen.

<i>(Yawn)</i>

And then there was Anne.

I'm having sex!

Johnny, stop that, now! Bad boy!
What will the neighbours

think - girl in your
room and the door closed?

They'll think I'm getting laid!

bit of booty never hurt nobody.

â™ªâ™ª

Growing up as a kid
on the beach was a blast.

I mean, everybody
knew everybody.

The surf was always good,
and every night was a party.

JD! What's up man?

What's happening, dude?

Somebody's parents were always
gone for the weekend, and if

that didn't happen, we'd take
it to the Shelburn House.

<i>(Explosion, Rock music)</i>

But what went down
over the next 24 hours is

something I will never forget.

So check this out.

Every kid has someone
they look up to, right?

Whether it's a baseball
player, a rock star,

or drives a race car - a hero.
Well it just so happened that

my hero, he lived right down
the street. And this guy had

the ability to make you feel
like you were walking on water.

<i>(Knock on door)</i>



Twenty, twenty-five,
forty-five,

fifty bucks. One more
payment and it's mine.

<i>(Knock on door)</i>

Hi!



Hi, hello!

Hi, hello! Sorry it's so
early, but, um, this may be

a little bit embarrassing,
but we're lost.

Would you happen to know were
1117 Shelburn Lane might be?

I do.


That's wonderful.

Excuse me.

Yeah, okay. Oh, thanks.


You know what?
Day after graduation,

summer's callin;
I'm gonna give you your board.

Just pay me when
you got the cash.

Here's your board.

This is um, you know,

it's your board. I mean,
I made it for you, so you

take care of the board and
she'll take care of you.

Now go on.

Make me proud.

<i>(Deep sigh)</i>

boards like it's nothing? These
are our boards, our property.

Fuck them! Fuck off--

Where's the fire?

and then put them
outside when you're done?

Only because I need
you in my life.

Love you.

So how's things?

Oh, you know.
Same old together one day,

broken up the next.
Back together again.

On again, off again.
Sex one day, no sex the next.

It's nice to know we

Yeah, I--

That's just Sparky.
He breaks it, he buys it!

All day!

Pretend this little fuckin totem
poll's their fucking face!

<i>(Breathes heavily)
Whoa.</i>

Um, where's your board?

It's gone!

Hey, JD.

Hey, Iris.
How's your mom?

She's in Vegas with
her new boyfriend.

Hey, did you look up
and down the beach?

Of course.
Ah, please. Come on!

Well, wait. Maybe the
tide took it out, Dude.

How many times a
year do I go out?

A lot.

And how many times
have I lost my board?

A lot.

Yeah, and how many times
have I swum in to get it?

As many times as you lost it.

Right. And how many times was
it right there waiting for me?

Yeah.

Every time.

Exactly, Dude. Every time,
except this fucking time.

about Reagan bombing Russia?


Reagan.
Reagan's bombing Russia.

I heard it on the
radio this morning.

stoned that Reagan is talking to

you personally through a radio?

No, no.
I'm not that stoned.

I'm that stoned.

<i>(Laughs)</i>

Dude, me too!

Let's get more stoned!

What am I gonna do, man?

Fuck! This is,
this is a symbol

for all that's sacred
to our way of life.

sacred to your way of life?

Wake up.

A surfboard is the most sacred
thing to our way of life.

It's, it's um
it's your girlfriend,

your car and
your dick - all in one.

Guys, he's like a Mexican Jesus.

So, uh, Jesus, what do we do?

We do what we do whenever
we don't know what to do.

â™ªâ™ª

Party at the Shelburn
House again, Anne? C'mon -

gotta meet some new people;
withering away over here.

Oh God, Iris, please! Shut up!
Have some fun! Lighten up!

I want to have fun.
I really do.

Okay, then have fun.

Uh. Okay,
who's gonna be there?

Well, who do you think?

Um, JD, Lardo, The yard guys,
Mike Moke, um, James, Bernard-

What?
What is your problem?

I just, well, look.

I wanna meet some guys who are
into the same things I'm into.

Um, Iris, boyfriends aren't
into poetry, painting and art.

Just have some fun,
for me, please, please?

Yeah, for you.
It's easy for you to say.

You've got sunshine
boy out there.

Okay, that's not that easy.

Know what? First chance I get,
I'm getting outta here.

I'm going to New York and
I'm gonna be an artist.

You know, I don't care about
being rich or famous, dude.

I just wanna work,
and keep my edge.

Your edge.

Yeah. My edge. And
when I do get a boyfriend,

he'll be into poetry,
painting and art. You watch.

Um, news flash, Iris. Hmm.
Boyfriends who are into

all that already have
boyfriends of their own.

Crap.

I got an idea!

Oh really? What?

Let's flash Sparky.

Okay.

You ready?

Yeah.

One, two, three!

What the hell is wrong with you?

â™ªâ™ª

Alright, JD. Tell me the
story in excruciating detail.

Alright, so--

I was out on my board
and then like all of a sudden

out of nowhere this like
perfect wave just comes at me.

So I paddle into it, right? And
I get up, and I lay down like

this sweet bottom turn and then
like, I was right there, yeah.

I'm right there, and the wave
just starts throwing its lip

over me, just like throwing
it over me like that.

It was like the most
beautiful feeling of my life.

And what happened
after that, man?

Uhh--

C'mon, man. You had
to see something, bro.

Yeah, uh, I'm
looking around, and--

and I see Del!

Yeah, man! The first person
I saw on the beach was Del!

Del!

Hey Del!

Oh. Hey, Guys.
What's up?

Hey.

Hey, hey.

Everything okay?

Yeah. Del, uh, listen.

Do you remember seeing
me this morning?

Sure. It was about 08:57,
close to nine. I tell time by

the sun and I usually get it
right within a minute or two.

Alright, well, look, my
surfboard got stolen.

Did you see anything?

Yeah. Did you
see anything?

What do you mean - the Souther?

He was driven' a Datsun 2802.
It was orange.

Do you remember anything else?

Dudes, you can't get the
right answers in life unless

you ask the right questions.

Whoa.


is the right question?


Really, JD, if I could find
the guy who did this to you,

I would kill him.

No. You know what?
I wouldn't just kill him,

I'd beat his ass first,
and then I would kill him.

No. You know what? I'd
kick his ass and kill him,

but first, I'd steal his board
so he knew what it felt like.

Shut up, stupid.

Why would he steal JD's
board if he already had one?

What?

If he had a board
to steal, I mean.

I'd steal that one.

Wait. What?
Which one would you steal?

I'd steal 'em both, Dude.

Yeah.

I'm a badass.

Okay, so how are we
gonna find this guy?

Oh, she said something
about that Souther

in the Datsun, yeah?

Yeah, right.
The orange 2802, huh?

Yeah.

You stupid blind fucker!

<i>(squealing tires)</i>

Ahhh!

Oh fuck.
Here we go again.

What!

What, Sparky?
What, Sparky?

What? I saw a guy
driving an orange 2802,

but I didn't think that
anyone would fuckin steal

a board so I didn't even
get a good look at him!

<i>(Slap)
Dude! Relax!</i>

What? Fuck you;
I'm not gonna relax!

What? You're just
remembering this now?

I'm gonna fuckin kill this guy!

Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Who, the Souther?

Yeah, man. He was driving
around in this sleazy fuckin

pick-up-some-pussy-valley-boy
car with the

board hanging out the back,
dude. Green and yellow, right?

Yeah?

Yeah? Well how do you
know he was a Souther?

Dude, he had a fuckin
typical Ken doll haircut.

Total valley
boy faggy-ass shit, and-

the fucker had
pants. Like, slacks.

Pants?

Pants?

Uh-oh.

Hey guys, uh, look who it is.

It's red bikini girl.



Check it out.

What I wouldn't do to
nib on one of those nibs.

what I wouldn't do to

suck on both of those nipples.

(JD And Lardo) A little bit
of booty never hurt nobody!


Maybe we should
go in and say hi.

Yeah, I don't know.


Yeah.

Shit.

What?

I'm supposed to
meet this kid today-

I'm selling him my skateboard.

You're selling your skateboard?

Yeah, they're gonna

we don't pay the bill.

Seriously, bro?

How much?

Sixteen dollars.


Uh, we have to figure out
this, uh, what is it 2QAN--

Later?

Yeah, later.

First we're gonna

(Mr. C) Candianadas.

Uh, okay, so I see this

your step-father, the drunk.

Oh yeah? He was in here

Oh that's great, typical.

(Mr. C) Hey!

Hey, so uh yeah, I was trying
to tell ya a story, alright?

So listen. So I drop in on this
wave, and I'm like totally

stoked and then it was like,
I'm doin a cut-back and I lay

it down with my hand and
I'm like skimming it with my

hand, and the lip
starts folding over.

It's like coming over me like

"And then I'm like "whoa" and

liquid water from
another planet.

Look what I found.

He just calls her that.

You don't know how much
we appreciate this.

Well, do me a favour.
Don't kill him.

Oh, and next time you

Fuckin Southers!

Oooh, stand by with the beer!

<i>(Laughs)</i>

<i>(Coughing)</i>

If you barf,

Great!

Hi, JD.

Oh, hey, Brenda.

That's it.</i>

Come one, come on baby, come on.

<i>(Engine cranks)</i>

Whoo!
Atta girl!

â™ªâ™ª

<i>(squealing tires)</i>

Good luck, Johnny!

<i>(Loud music and singing)</i>

So get this. I totally
saw this guy today, man.

He's drivin' down the road,
in this bright-ass orange,

look at me, 2802; the typical
Souther. I mean, it seemed

like his hair was personally
styled by Vidal Sassoon.

<i>(Laughs)</i>

And uh, he was wearing pants.



Pants!

<i>(Banks on door)

situation here, so listen up!

These fucking Southers.
They come to our beautiful

beach, and they desecrate
it, and I'm sick of it!

It's over, and they're
going to pay, now!

Yeah!!

So fucking frightening.

Totally.
It turns me on.

What?

Whatever.

God, you're so weird.

deal. An elite team of us,

a band of brothers are gonna go
tonight, in La Lumbie and we're

gonna find this guy and we're
gonna bring my board back!

<i>(Cheering)</i>

We're going.

No. Anne, no.
I'm not going.

Yes. Shut up, Iris.
We're going. Shut up!

Oh shit.

<i>(Loud burp)</i>

My fellow Venturians,
the time has come.

Lardo!

Fuck it.

(Car starts)

<i>(Cheering)</i>

Mooney's?

What are we doing here?

There's somethin' I need to do.

So Mike, I know I shoulda been
more careful. I'm gonna get

the board back and I'm gonna
get you that last payment, too.

We got an address; we know
where this guy is, so you know,

don't worry.
It'll be easy.


They're gonna run
off to the valley,

and probably get
into a bunch of trouble.

Let's go get us a surfboard.

Mooney's comin with us?
Now we can take on the

whole fuckin Valley,
dude. Let's do this.

(Car starts)

â™ªâ™ª

Why do you call your
car La Lumbie, anyway?

Well, it used to be La Bamba,
but the L's; they took over.

First it was Bomber,
then La Bamba.

Now it's La Lumbie.

Yeah. Because le
Ian lalk lin lels.

L, Pm S
â€œW?

Le Ian lalk lin lels.

You can talk in L's?

Wow. I really gotta
get away from here.

We're going to war,
and we need war music.

We need a fuckin battle hymn.





Germ.

Uh, Ramones.

Bob Marley.

I got the Thompson Twins.

No Thompson Twins.

Pick a tape.

Tape?

<i>Fear.</i>

Hell, yeah.

Right on.

Now that is road-trip music.

<i>(Rock music)</i>

Mooney rocks.

Now, eh - turn it up.

<i>(Loud music)</i>

The valley of the shadow of
death in all its wretched glory.

Millions of Southers,
wearing pants.

I hate pants.

I hate pants, too!

One of 'em named Brian Kramer.

Yeah. Somewhere
down in that cesspool of

humanity is JD's surfboard.

Watch for Van Nuys
and turn right.

I'm from here, remember?

We need gas.

<i>(squealing tires)</i>

Hey sparky!

What's up?

I challenge you to a sponge-war.

Alright, you bastard,
show me what you got!

God, I can't wait to get
outta here next month.

I know. Parson's
gonna be so cool.

You'll be in New York,
and meanwhile I'll be

at UC Santa Cruz.

Oh, but you'll like it, Annie.
You'll love it.

You'll meet some guy - an
intellectual who surfs, and fall

in love, get married, have
babies, grow old, fade out.

You make it sound so boring.

Are you kidding?
I wish I could do that.

I'm, I'm too psychotic.


Ah, but you'll be in New York.

Your life is gonna
be so awesome.

I mean, I hope so. You know
I just can't wait to visit

all the places I've read about.
You know, like CGBGs.

Who's playing there now?

Oh, Max's Kansas City where
Louie and the Velvet Underground

played with Niko; Grace Church,
where Allen Ginsberg and Jim

Carrol read their poetry.

Someday I just really
hope I meet Lori Anderson.

Um, who's that?

You know; she has that
song, "Oh Superman."

I don't know it.

Yeah!

<i>(Mexican music plays)
Whoa, whoa.</i>

Hey, whoa.

Whoa, what?

Yes, yes it is.

â™ªâ™ª

Oh, gasoline!

Why are they doing that?

Uh, they lost a
bet to Lardo's cousin,

so now every time they
hear that song, this ensues.

That's the dumbest fuckin
thing I've ever seen.

Hey, Mike.

Whoo!

You alright?

Yeah.

â™ªâ™ª

There it is.

This is the part where
they cut to outside the car

and we see like this jerky
point of view thing.

And there's this guy
dragging this foot.

He's creeping up on the
car, and we don't know it,

but he's got a steel
hook for a hand. Wheeee!

Shut up!

Just save it.

Alright, seriously.
What's the plan here?

Torch the place!

Sparky! Down.

What if we sneak around the
house and look in the windows?

You're such a perv.

That ain't a perv thing.
This is James Bond shit, here.

<i>(Laughs)</i>

No, no, no. We get a brick,
cover it in a towel, douse it

in gasoline, set in on fire,
and chuck it through the window.

That's a bit extreme, Sparky.

One more.

<i>(Can drops)</i>

One more what, Mike?

One more beer.

Yeah.

information's correct, my

surfboard's in that house, in
his car, or he hid it someplace.

Oh my God. Just do something -
anything. How 'bout that?

Knock on the door.

Totally.

â™ªâ™ª

<i>(Knock on door)</i>

<i>(Timid) Uh, hi sir.</i>

My name's JD.

These are my friends,
and well it seems--

We're here cause
there's a problem with--

Do you have a son?

You see, my board
was stolen today, and well,

we think that maybe Brian,
that's his name, right?

That Brian kinda, well, that
he was the one who stole it.

And we got a license
plate from an eyewitness and

we're pretty sure that he's
the one who stole my board,

but maybe we got it wrong.

It's okay.

<i>(Dials number)</i>

Hello.


Yeah, it was right
there in his room.

That was like, too easy, man. We
should just get outta here, bro.

not goin' anywhere yet.

I hate worse than a liar.

And that's a thief.

I need to apologize.
My son's done a bad thing here,

and I can understand
you all being upset.

What's your name?

Mike Mooney.

Well, Mike Mooney,
I suppose you've got an

idea of how you'd
like to handle this?

I think we'd like to
handle it ourselves.

My son stole a surfboard.

He didn't kill anyone.

That's understood.

Alright.

What's up with you?

Nothing.

C'mon, Iris. I know you better
than that. What's goin' on?

What?

Don't "what" me.
What's goin' on?

There's nothing goin' on, Anne.

Iris, speak to me.

I know the guy,
okay? I know him.

You what?

You got it back.
Right on!



Yeah. Now what
the fuck do we do?

Why don't we just,
ya know, go home?

What? What? No, no,
no, no, no. Fuck that, JD.

We came all the way
out to this Valley; we gotta

do something to
this fucking guy - c'mon!

You got your surfboard back.

There's still time to go
back to the Shelburn House.

I mean, imagine the look
on everyone's faces when

you come back with the board.

No! Shhh No!

Getting the board back's
only half the journey.

Totally.

You know what you
gotta do, right?

I mean, you gotta find this guy.

And scare the living
shit out of him!

Okay great.
Uhm, so what do we do now?

I don't know.
I'll know it when I see him.

That's it? We're just gonna
wait here 'til he comes back?

You don't get it, do ya?

I can't walk away from this.
I gotta, I gotta either wait

here 'til he comes, or I gotta
go find the guy. That's it.

That could take forever.

I mean do you know how
fucking huge this city is?

He's at Buffalo Records
in Tarzana. He works there.

At least that's-

that's where he
worked when we were dating.

<i>(Lardo laughs)</i>

You dated this guy?

Iris, he wears pants.

Idiot, you have pants on.

That's completely different.

He gave me records, okay? It
lasted for like ten minutes

and then I dumped him
and he got all freaky.

I didn't know he would do
something like this, JD.

I'm sorry, okay?
I'm, I'm really sorry.

that acts of revenge actually

trigger a response in the
brain's pleasure zones.

Like when you
eat or you have sex.

Really?

Yeah.

And where did you get this
little tidbit of information?

Uhhh--

Oh! Maybe it was in
the American Journal of

I-don't-know-what-the-
fuck-I'm-talking-about.

Ooohh!

Ha ha ha.

So. How shall we do this?

Just take it
nice and smooth.

Alright.
I can be smooth.

with you in one second.

That's it!
That's it right there!

<i>(squealing tires)</i>

That is him!
That is him! Go, go, go!

Hey guys, be careful!

<i>(Shouting all around)</i>

You're gonna fuckin die!

I'm gonna kill you!

C'mon Sparky, put the
fucking rock down!

Bros, guess who's
calling the cops!

Kill you!

I'm gonna fuckin...

C'mon, let's go. so. so!

Cock sucker!

Fuck you!

Sorry, guys-

It's amazing what someone will
do to get the latest hit.

they wanted was on you, Brian.

How did we do?

Huh. Not so smooth.

What do we do now?


<i>(Laughs)</i>

(Hot Rod Guy)
Pierpont vodka, huh?


That's imported, right?


I hear them crazy Ruskies make
this shit out of potatoes.

Yep. Gonna need
to see some ID.

Just kidding!

Oh, yeah.
Thanks a lot.

There ya go.
Can you change four bucks?

Need some help?

Have a good day.

Happy New Year, Chief.

(Hot Rod Girl)
C'mon, baby.


Hey. Kenny, so uh, yeah.

I see this bitchin' wave comin
in, and it's like pitching over.

I'm like scratching for the
outside, like goin' like this,

and it's like pitching and then
it slams me on the ground, man.

And I'm like, whoa getting
worked, dude, and then...

Do you surf?

No.

Hey man, I do this thing with
my hair; it's killer, bro.

Ready?

<i>(Loud yelling)</i>

So you're from Venture, then.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, I can tell.

These are sixty-nine
cents, here?

Yep.

In Venture, they're
forty-nine cents.

Hmm. Then why don't you
go buy one in Venture?

What kind of
lifestyle do you live?

That's insulting.

<i>(Burps)</i>

Have a beer with Fear, boys.


<i>(Loud music)</i>

gonna believe this.

Mooney went with the
guys to find JD's board.

Wasn't he in 'Nam?

No. We saw Apocalypse
Now like nine times.

Hey, everybody listen up!
Those guys make it back

with the board, we're
letting 'em on the deck!

Bitchin'.

Whoo-hoo!
Fake set!

I don't get it.

This guy dated you
and you dumped him.

Why'd he steal my board?
I didn't do nuthin' to him.

I have no idea, JD.

I told you; he's just a freak.

<i>(Burp)</i>


This is the most exciting
stake-out I've ever been on.

contest with no swell.

Everyone's just sitting there
waiting for something to happen.

Coast invitational's.

You goin' to that, Mike?

No, I'm out.

What? Why? You killed
it last month at Pismo.

I finished thirty-fourth.

Comes a time to move on.

I surf for the fun of it and
shape for the love of it.

I was just thinking.

<i>(Snoring)</i>

You know in a couple months
summer's gonna be over.

That always happens.

So, we're all outta
high school, now.

And some of us are gonna
go to college, get jobs,

and start
doing adult stuff.

Yeah, and shit that we hate.

Well look, all I'm
saying is, you know;

things are gonna
be different, now.

Man! I hate this shit.

Start talking about the future;
getting all high and serious.

Shit.

I don't know what I'm
gonna do in an hour!

Yeah, and that's really fucked.

What are you saying,
Anne? A lot of people,

they stay in Ventura -
keep partying, surfing.

People like who? Harry, who,
ya know, gets kids to steal

beer for him? I mean, great
fucking role models, JD.

Well you think we should
buy into this shit?

That we should start
working and wearing pants?

Is that it? Huh?
Buying insurance?

Get a vacuum cleaner and shit?

Yeah?

You really think that this
is all there is to life?

Maybe.

If I thought that, I would
so fucking kill myself.

have to, you know.

You don't have to
buy a vacuum cleaner.

What choice do you have, Mooney?

We need more beer.




Will you help me, Lardo?

Yeah.

Those guys were acting
like such guys, tonight.

Yeah.

<i>(Laughs)</i>

This pet's having
like no effect.

Um, you just gotta give it
some time to kick in, ya know?

Careful, dude.

Just thinking about Iris.

Ann's goin'to college.
Probably meet some guy.

Iris is moving to New York.

How do you guys
do that, anyways?

Do what?

Do chicks and all, man?

Easy. You just put your
hand here, inside their leg,

and then you
just slide it up.

Slide it up.
It works every time, man.

Feels pretty good.

Not your own leg, man.
The chick's.

Well, iris's apple wine
works pretty good, too.

It's just like drivin' a car.

What would you do if
you were gonna go on a

long road trip with Lumbie?

Get in, start her
up, and take off!

God, no.
Listen.

Ya gotta...ya gotta
sweet talk her a little.

Give her a little
loving, nurturing.

You baby her a little.
You check her um, you

check her fluids, make sure
there's enough lubrication.

You kick the tires, make
sure your rubber's good.

And if you feel
confident, and ready,

you slide in the driver's seat.

You tickle the starter
and you turn her over.

Then you slip it into drive

and you gently start
to push her forward.

And then you're on your way.

But that's when you have
to, you have to listen to her,

really start to pay attention.

And as she starts to warm up,
her temperature starts to rise,

that's when, you know, you
can pump her a little harder,

you know?

And she'll let ya
know when she's ready.

She'll start to hum.

When she starts to hum you go
pedal to the medal, as hard as

you can for as long as you can.
That's, that's when it's good.

That's when it gets, you know,
that's like you're a machine on

an open back road somewhere in
America with nothing but like a

forest or corn field on either
side of you with stars in the

sky, and no traffic lights.
There's no coppers, no worries.

That's just, that's
as good as it gets.

That's-
that's being a man;

that's heaven on earth;
that's what that is.

What does all that have
to do with getting women?

You don't have to worry about
it for a long time, uh, Sparky.

Alright, where's the turn?

It's coming, I think.

It's either coming
or we passed it.

What?

Turn here.
Turn here!

<i>Okay, okay!
(squealing tires)</i>

back streets, okay?

Okay. Valley View,
Valley Lane, Valley Drive.

Great! They're all
the same stupid name!

Man, we're gonna miss it.

Miss what?

The fight!

Lardo, you are so busted;
you wanna see the fight.

Yeah, I kinda do.

Okay, where are we?

Lost.

Totally and completely lost.

I'm leally leally lost.

Oh ly Lod; I Ian lalk in leis!

<i>(Laughs)</i>

Not funny, Lardo.
What have you done to her?

<i>(Engine dies)</i>

Alright, what just happened?

Well, I think we're out of gas.

You just filled it up.

I only put one dollar in it.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Doomed.
We're all doomed.

Whoa.

Whoa, what?

You hear that?

I don't hear shit.

That's just it.
Ya can't hear the ocean.

That's weird.

Ya can't hear it;
ya can't smell it.

Yeah.

Whoa! Shit!

<i>(indistinct voices)</i>

What's he doin'?

Shh! I can't hear him!

<i>(Snoring)</i>

You can come on out!

Sparky! Psst!

<i>(Snoring)</i>

You got something to say?

Why'd you do it?
Do you even surf?

Then why steal a surfboard?

It was stupid.
Just forget it.

Brian. Just tell him.

My girlfriend...

Iris. She broke up with
me, for some, uh, surfer.

So you were just pissed
at some random surfer?

And so you decided
to steal my board?

What's the fuckin
logic in that, huh?

You got your board back!
This is over.

That's not for you to say.

Now the way I see it is
this you have two options.

One, you can call the cops,

or two, you can dole out
a whipping for yourself.

What's it gonna be?

I'll take option number two.

Dad, these guys are
gonna fuckin kill me!

Brian, don't embarrass
yourself any further.

You get three swings.
That's all. Fair?

Fair.

I sot him!

That's one.

Fuck, Sparky!

Piece of cake.

C'mon, man; he's drunk. He
doesn't know what he's doin'!

I said three swings. That
counts. You got two left.

Wait a minute.
He said one of you guys gets

three swings.
He already took one.

So he's gotta take
the other two.

I mean that's the rule, right?
Three swings; one guy.

That's what he said.

Fine.

You hear that Sparky, huh?

<i>Two swings.
Two swings.</i>

Just get me close.
I can't miss him.

Get in there.

Hi, fairy-boy.

Fuck!

That's two.

That should count
as two and three!

Keep quiet. Take your licks.
He hasn't even hit you.

Get up, Sparky; get up.
Ya gotta get up! C'mon!

You got one more! One mo-
he's laughing at us, man!

One more; one more, Sparky!
Come on! Come on!

Don't laugh at me!

Dude.

<i>(Laughs)</i>

You laughing at?

This is your last chance.

Then I'm taking my boy
inside and that's it.

Get up, man.

Get up; ya gotta get UP-
Get up, Sparky!

Get up! Come on!

<i>(Distorted voices)</i>

<i>(Punch)</i>

Alright!

Oh shit!

Sparky, man. Sparky,
you did it, man! You did it!

You nailed him, man.
You got him. You got him.

<i>(Snoring)</i>

Sparky? Holy shit;
he's asleep! He's asleep!

Alright, then.
You fellas satisfied?

Now I want ya to make up.

Shake hands.

I, um, I'm sorry, man.

It's cool.
No real harm done.

You Okay?

C'mon, Bri.

Let's get ya inside,
get an icepack on that jaw.


I never got your name.

Sam.

Sam Kramer.

I just wanna say, it was,
uh, real nice meeting you.

I just, I wanted
to say that to ya.

I was gone a lot when
he was growing up.

Didn't do a very good
job there, I'm afraid.

Most of the time, you do the
best you can do, and hope the

rest just falls in line
and sometimes it does.

Don't forget Sparky, there.

Wiener man! What'd you do -
go down to Ventura and,

uh get more wieners?

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Hey bro.

Kenny, dude. I ran outta gas
about a mile down the road,

and yeah I was just wondering,
can I borrow a gas can?

Oh. Man. Well,
uh this isn't Ventura.

You know, we sell gas cans;
we don't just lend 'em out.

I'd be happy to sell ya one and
I'll sell ya some gas, too.

Oh, yeah.
How much are they?

Three dollars.

Three dollars?

Yep.

Yeah, I got three bucks.

I got three bucks
somewhere here.

One. I got one.

<i>(Change tingling)</i>

Hold on.

Two, two twenty -
ut- three bucks.

And fifteen cents.

Yeah!

So then I guess you
have enough to get, uh,

fifteen cents worth
of gas, wiener man.

Hey, bro, look. can you just,
can, give me a break, man.

Let me borrow the gas can; I'll
bring it right back, dude.

Look, man, we sell em, okay?
We don't rent 'em.

<i>(Slides money back)</i>

Dude, where are your friends?

Lost in the valley of
the shadow of death.

This whole day has been like
one endless bummer, dude.

Hey bros.


Do you like have a gas can I
can borrow? My car ran outta

gas, and well, this dude
won't let me borrow a can.

Ah, you ran outta gas, huh?

Yeah. It's just
like a mile up that way.

We got some beers leftover
if ya help us out.

Yeah, sure, man. Sure.

Bitchin' can, dude.
Thanks.

Hop in!

Man, I just wanted to
fuckin kick that guy's ass.

You know, just,
just kick his ass.

One punch.
Just one fuckin punch.

You got one punch.

Well, yeah, but, I mean I
should have fucking pounded him.

I should kicked his fuckin
teeth in, man. You know what?

I'm gonna go back in there.
You wanna come?

He said three swings, Sparky.

Who gives a shit what
that old fucker said.

I'll kick his ass, too.

Fuck, Sparky.
I'm sick of it, man.

Ya talk all this bullshit;
I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna

do that and you just get
drunk and you don't do nuthin'.

You don't do shit.
So shut up, alright?

You okay?

I just wanna go home.

Thanks, bros.

Hopefully it'll fill up and
we'll be able to get outta here.

Hey wait.
What are your names?

Esmeralda.

Guinevere.

Esmeralda and Guinevere, huh?

(Guy 2) Hey, where you from?

Africa.

Johannesburg.

Can't you tell they're
just fuckin with us?

That true? Were

Hey listen guys.
Thanks so...we need to...

(Guy 2) I don't think so.

<i>(Screaming)</i>

What the fuck?

Go, Anne! Go!

Fuck!

(Guy 2) C'mon!
You like that?

<i>Hey asshole!</i>

<i>(Clang!)</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª </i>

Later, bitch.

<i>â™ªâ™ª </i>

Pieces of shit. Get in your
fuckin piece of shit van

or I will ficking
smash your brains out!

Come on!
Get in the Lumbie!

1 Hey, what about our beer?

Shit.
They're gonna follow us.

No they're not.

Fuckers.

Whoa.

They're here.

<i>â™ªâ™ª </i>

Alright.

Thanks for comin, Mike.

I'll get ya that money, too.

Ah, just give it
when you get it.

So?

Gotta grab my skateboard
outta the back.

Hey Sparky.

Hey.

Thanks, dude.

No really, I mean,

that shit I said before,
it's just, I don't know.

Weird fuckin night, huh?

Yeah.

I just...

If I gotta have
someone at my back,

I'm just glad it's you, dude.

Yeah?

Yeah. We're gonna be talking
about this for years.

We will, won't we?

I'm gonna catch
some zzzz's, man.

Yeah.

You goin' surfing later?

What else?

You know, I actually enjoyed
myself tonight, man.

Me too.

Later, Sparky.

Now I gotta find my tape.

Uh, I got it.

I gotta go to work.

So I guess I'll see you?

Of course.

Hey, uh, you know whatever
happened back there--

Oh, he just, he just
roughed me up a little.

Fucker he tore my shirt.

Yeah, I mean, you're, you're,
you're okay, and I'm okay,

so we're you're good,
right? You're, you're okay?

You know what?

I mean whatever doesn't kill
you makes you stronger, right?

Whoa.

Dude, I didn't make that up!

Still good, though.

Yeah?

Later?

Sure.

Hey, I'm really sorry that
prick stole your board, dude.

It's not your fault.

I know that.

Later, gator.
Nice work.

Hey. Later, Darling.

Tell your mom I love her stew.

Tell your mom I
love her daughter.

You're such a liar.

What? I'm so totally
committed to you.

Yeah, you're
committed to something,

but it ain't me, babe.

What's that supposed to mean?

When you figure it out, call me.

â™ªâ™ª

Hey Lardo, what do
think it all means, man?

What?

The whole thing, dude. I mean,

this guy gets dumped; he
steals my board, he doesn't even

know me, and Del just happens
to be there, and it's like

we get this name and because
of that we go to the Valley?

we're building over in Ventura.

Oh it's wonderful,
four stories.

He turned out to be not such

a bad guy - just some dude
who got dumped - by Iris.

Bro, she took his heart
and she just like ripped

it up into pieces. She's
fuckin vicious, that girl.

Well, we got your board back.

<i>(squealing tires)</i>

Shit!

Man.

Oh, Shit!

Ah.

<i>(Deep sigh)</i>




<i>(Crack!)</i>


it hit me.

It wasn't about a surfboard;
it was about the journey,

with my friends.

Lardo and I are still
the best of friends.

He has a beautiful daughter
now and always makes the best

of every day - in typical
Lardo fashion, of course.

Sparky lived every day like
there was no tomorrow.

He rode his last wave in
at the age of twenty-five.

He was truly one-of-a-kind,
man, and I'll always remember

the crazy shit we
used to do together.

Nobody did it like Sparky.
Miss ya, bro.

Iris went to New York
and became an artist,

just like she said she would.

She's not rich and famous yet,
but she still keeps her edge,

and visits Ventura
whenever she can.

Anne found a great guy
willing to commit to her.

She's married,
has a beautiful boy,

and I still remain great
friends with her and her family.

My hero Mike Mooney.
He's a family man, now.

Still the legend on Pierpont,
and hand-shaping surfboards

in the same garage -
for the love of it.

<i>(Taps surfboard)</i>


lotta change in Ventura,

but then again,

lots of things have
stayed the same - like Del.

And as for me,
I got a beautiful wife,

four great kids,
play music with my friends,

and still surfing -

in Ventura.

â™ªâ™ª
