(gentle holiday music)

As soon as we finish stuffing

our bellies full of
turkey and stuffing,

we're already mentally preparing
for the main attraction.

We make wishlists,
start planning the
perfect holiday party,

dive into piles of
peppermint goodies

and tease our kids about being
on the naughty or nice list.

It's hard to remember
that Christmas

isn't about tracking down
the season's hottest gadget,

or one upping our
neighbors decorations.

It's about honoring our roots,
reveling in the present.

We all spend so much
time rushing around

to meetings and
appointments and dates,

and for Instagram posts.

Christmas is about
peace, not productivity.

It should be the
only time of year

when we're allowed to just be.

And that's where
Harlow Furnishings'

new holiday accessories
line comes in.

We'll do all the work for you.

You just be, because in the end,

family is always
your best decoration.

You nailed it.

family is always
your best decoration.

in a city like New York.

The Rockefeller tree,

the festive department
store window displays.

I mean, Radio City Music Hall?

The city just bursts
with Christmas cheer.

Sure, the city does
Christmas in style,

and I'm sure you also had some
great Christmases growing up.

Well, when you've never
had a real Christmas before,

you have a lot of
time in between

to fill in the
blanks (chuckles).

Your family
doesn't do Christmas?

Well, my family owns a
Chinese restaurant in Wichita.

It's one of the only
restaurants open for Christmas.

So, the holidays are the
busiest time of the year.

(bright holiday music)

(dishes clattering)

(music continues)

Now, between
now and Christmas,

we've make thousands
of this (chuckles).

By next year I'll have the
recipe perfected (laughs).

Hey.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Someone's yearning for
her architecture days.

designing maybe,

but the deadlines and
neurotic clients, never.

Oh (chuckles).
(Jane chuckles)

Oh, Jane.

Mm.

I am grateful
for your moo shu.

It's depressing cooking for one.

Oh.

I can't believe Jerry's
been gone six months.

You know, that new Wichita
University basketball coach

is just, doesn't
have the same energy.

How is your
daughter holding up?

I haven't seen her
in here lately.

It's like nothing happened.

just spending every
waking hour at work.

Well, she's got
that fancy CFO job.

Lots of responsibility.

That she does.

Oh, I guess I better get going.

Lots of errands to run.

Only a few more
days before our...

Before my annual holiday party.

you later, Jane.

(bright holiday music)

I know, I know.

I know it's not your
fault that all flights

from Hawaii have been delayed.

I know what active
volcano warning means.

Yes, sweetheart?

I know what active
volcano warning means.

What am I supposed
to do for Christmas?

Is the food ready?

I'm starving.

Sweetheart, I know.

Just gimme one second, please.

Girls, do you
wanna see me guess

what a fortune cookie says?

Yeah!
Yeah?

Okay, here they are.

Which one should we do?

Oh, this is a hard one.

I can do it.

Okay (grunting), I got it.

This fortune cookie says
that a pleasant surprise

is coming your way.

Shall we see? All right?

All right, you read
it and tell me.

It says, " Pleasant
surprise is coming your way."


(music continues)

Hey, Nate.
Oh.

Extra duck sauce for Vivian,

no peanuts for the Kung Pao,

and I know Jessa's allergic.

It's sad how well you know
us, but oddly comforting.

So, it's just
you and the girls?

Yep.

And I'm still
trying to figure out

how to make a decent lunch

while pulling off a
mediocre French braid.

(Nate chuckles)
(Jim chuckles)

I'm sorry, Nate (laughs).

It's all good.

I promised the girls
the best holiday ever,

and that's exactly what
I'm gonna give 'em.

Nonstop fun, fun, fun.

Wish me luck.

Working up a sweat and
it's not even dinner time.

Busiest we've ever been,
and that's saying a lot.

There you go.

Oh.

Princeton?

And it's thick.

You know what that means?

This is the fourth early
admission letter you've gotten,

all from amazing colleges.

Not like I can go anyways,
so what's the point?

Oh, Miguel.

My pops would
freak if he found out

I was getting accepted to
all these fancy schools.

Probably try and do something
crazy to gimme the money.

Did you apply to that
scholarship Jane told me about?

I got my interview tomorrow.

Oh, Miguel, that's wonderful.

(Miguel chuckles)

(bells jingling)
(bright holiday music)

I thought your doctor
said you weren't supposed

to be eating anything
spicy, salty, or fried?

I had a stroke, not
a taste bud removal.

Besides, I'm fine.

How'd you sneak outta
your house anyways?

My therapist thinks
I'm in the bathroom.

Just gimme my pork fried rice.



Hey.

Thanks.

You're such a lifesaver.

Oh, thank you.

Finally, you're
my last delivery,

so hopefully I'll be
able to feel my fingers

before I go to bed.

Oh (chuckles).

See you.
Bye.

(Miguel sighs)
(bright holiday music)

Daily dose of lo mein.

Oh, thank God.

I skipped breakfast this morning

to get an early start
and I have a late night.

Do you ever not
have a late night?

Tech is a 24/7 business.

Innovation doesn't stop just
because it's late December,

but just because I'm
burning the midnight oil

doesn't mean
everyone needs to be.

Head home early, Beth.

Your vacation starts tomorrow.

The holidays with
three little ones?

I'd hardly call that a vacation.

You're so lucky you get to
have a nice simple Christmas.

Lucky me.

Merry Christmas, Beth.


(melancholy music)

(Veronica exhales)

Okay.

I wrote down like a dozen orders

and they're all
over the city, so...

Where'd you get that?

It was hidden in
the deep dark corner

of the walk-in freezer.

Oh.

How'd you find that?

Saw you cook it
and hide it there.

I was just messing around.

My dad's the chef.

Come on, dude.

My dad's the chef.

What is this? It's amazing.

It's tasty.

Not like it matters.

My dad doesn't even know
that I want to be a chef.

I mean, I could be wrong,

but I think there are
other restaurants.

(contemplative music)

Let's see which annoying
customer interrupted
my only break.

That annoying
customer would be me.

Sadie!

Hi.

Rick, hey.

It's been awhile.

Yeah, it has.

Is that mine (chuckles)?

Oh, yeah.

Here you go (chuckles).

No big Hanukkah dinner tonight?

My dad always burns the latkes

and the brisket is so dry
we could use it as kindling,

so these are reinforcements.

Just like the old days, huh?

I remember when you
used to work here,

there'd be a lot of leftovers
going to the Cohen house.

This place definitely
saved my appetite

and my sanity more than once.

You still at UCLA?

Senior year.

What about you?

When did you get back?

Oh no, I'm just
chilling here in Wichita.

Staying with my folks.

each other in person since-

You ditched me
right before prom.

Oh, I'm so sorry, Sadie.

I was already in college.

My frat brothers told me
it was a little pathetic

to be slow dancing in my
high school gym (chuckles).

Could have shared that
with me before I bought

a dress that I couldn't return

because it was stained with
tears and Cheeto fingerprints.

I thought you only asked me

because you wanted your
first dance to be chill.

Go with a friend, no pressure.

Not exactly.

Hey, can we catch up
maybe tonight or tomorrow?

I'm pretty busy with family
stuff before I head back.

You gotta let me make
up for being such a jerk.

We can reintroduce you

to good old Midwestern
holiday shenanigans.

That does sound tempting.

(Rick chuckles)
(gentle music)

I am loving the romantic
vibe, but you've done too much.

I don't want to set off
your smoke detector.

It's our last night
together before the holidays.

I wanted to do
something special.

You know, savor
her this last shred

of cheer before soy sauce
servitude (chuckles).

Okay, this may be crazy,
but come to Vermont with me.

You want me to spend
Christmas with your family?

I know it's a huge step
and it's totally last minute,

but I've already rented a car

and my family's been wanting
to meet you for ages.

That sounds so amazing.

It's just that it's
the busiest week

of the year for the restaurant,

and my parents would
kill me for bailing.

Plus I would feel
horrible about having

so much fun while they were
knee deep in dumplings.

I get it.

Maybe next year, hm?

You remember the year Romy
wanted a Barbie Dreamhouse?

The one with the pink
convertible (chuckles).

We didn't get to
the mall till New Year

and it was all sold out.


Yeah.

(Sue chuckles)
(Jim chuckles)

Look, this from Mrs. Wilson.

Oh.

Look, this from Mrs. Wilson.

All our lovely customers.

I can't believe how
much they've added

to this tree over the years.

Yes, even if we didn't
have a tree at home,

we always got this one.

(Sue chuckling)

I wish there was a way
to make it up to the kids.

Let them have a
proper Christmas.

Enjoy the season
without thinking

about busing tables
or unloading supplies.

(phone ringing)

Ah.

It's Romy.

Oh, the new tap's here.

Hi, honey.

How are you?

Crushed my presentation
and celebrated with Blake.

Ah!

Crushed my presentation
and celebrated with Blake.

Asked me to join.

Oh, that's a huge
step (chuckles).

It would've been so magical,
not just to meet his family,

but to experience
a real Christmas.

(playful music)

Maybe you should go, honey.

I think my wifi glitched

because I thought I heard you
say I should go with Blake.

We've got the Dragon covered,

so have an amazing
Christmas with Blake.

Ah (squeals)!

Really?

(bright holiday music)

Hey, Dr. Cohen.


Happiest of
holidays to you too.

We missed you at
our cocktail party.

So, how did we do?

Unfortunately,
none of the embryos

made it through the blast.

But we had four
of them this time.

The numbers just
weren't on our side.

I'm so sorry.

I really wish that I
had better news for you.

It looks really fresh today.

I got lucky at the
market this morning.

(Rick laughs)
(Jim laughs)

Have you heard from
your sister yet?

Just phone taggin'.

Well, this is the first guy

that she's been
really serious about.

Yeah, he seems okay.

Every time we talk
he's bugging me

to start an IRA or
buy mutual funds

or something incredibly boring.

He has a good career,

and he's only a few
years older than you-

Dad.

and he's only a few
years older than you-

I have had a job,
at the restaurant.

that I actually like cooking?

What would you
do with your life

if the restaurant isn't around?


Like the two biggest
workaholics I know

are gonna decide to
close up and relax?


(gentle music)

I think you dropped this.

Oh, thanks Jack.

Spec, Zuma and Spector?

You actually read this?

Just keep it, okay?

(gentle music)

(music continues)

Thank you for staying late.

(music continues)

When Sue and I first
arrived in Kansas,

we were petrified and we knew

the bonds that the
food can create.

And over time,

Wichita became home and
you became our family,

which makes it even harder to...

We're closing the
restaurant for good.

The last day will
be Christmas Eve.

(employees murmuring)
(melancholy music)

We know this is
tough news to hear.

You know, we are
old, we are tired,

and we move slower
and we hurt more.

We'd love to keep
the restaurant open,

but you just know when
a chapter is ending.

Your envelopes include
a month of severance.

Why close the day
before Christmas?

It's our busiest day.

We want you to spend
Christmas with your loved ones.

It's something you haven't
done for a long time.

But some of us need this job.

We'll help you
find other jobs,

give you glowing recommendations.

What are you gonna do?

This restaurant is your life.

to some developers and we've
bought a house in Flagstaff.

On a golf course.

Seriously, guys?

You sold the Dragon and
we're moving to Arizona

and you didn't
think it'd be nice

to tell me before you
drop that bomb in public?

Sometimes it's hard for people

to move on without momentum.

What's that supposed to mean?

and ended up in Wichita
because I had a third cousin

who owned a restaurant here.

We didn't know
anything about cooking

or have passion for food really.

But we learned our way
around the kitchen very quickly

because we had to make a living

and provide a good
future for our kids.

Thinking back, we
shouldn't have let the Dragon

take over yours and
Romy's childhood.

We wanted to keep
you guys close to us.

We didn't want you to end
up toiling your lives away

in a greasy kitchen like we did.

But I like working here.

You've used a restaurant
as a crutch for too long.

You need to create
your own path.

Who's gonna tell Romy?

in stupid Vermont?

We'll tell her
after the holiday.

No, I get it more than anyone,

but she would want to be
here for a real Christmas

with her real family.

but she would want to be
here for a real Christmas

It's done, it's done.

(Rick sighs)

(music continues)

I can't believe
you grew up here.

Your Christmases must
have been so wonderful.

Carols around the piano,
snowball fights in the yard,

presents under a
freshly picked tree

with just the right ratio
of tinsel and ornaments.

Somebody's watched too
many Christmas movies.

All my life I've wanted
to anticipate Christmas

instead of dreading it.

Other kids got to spend
Christmas baking cookies

and building snowmen
and opening presents.

We spent Christmas
slinging egg foo young

and refilling jasmine tea.

My parents were too busy

So, this will be my
first real Christmas,

like ever (laughs).

Oh!
Mom, Dad, this is Romy.

Nice to meet you.

Welcome to our home.

We have heard such
wonderful things.

Oh!

So nice to meet you.

Wow, that is so
thoughtful, Romy.

Would you mind if I keep
this outside on the porch?

Our Moxie gets into everything

and poinsettias can
be toxic to animals.

Yeah, no worries
(laughs nervously).

I totally get it.

Well, let's get inside.
Yeah!

Great.

(gentle music)

(bright holiday music)

You have such a lovely
home, Mrs. Bennett.

Thank you, but
please, call me Tinsley.

Oh my, and what
a beautiful tree.

Oh, but it looks so real.

Where is everybody?

Outback building a snowman.

Always look for-
Uncle Blake!

Hey! Oh!
(Jen laughs)

Hi, you must be Bridgett!

And who are you?
Bridgett.

I am so sorry.

And who are you?
Bridgett.

I'm Dylan, Blake's brother.

I'm Jen, the sister-in-law.
Oh!

Hey.
So nice

to meet you in person.

Oh.
Nice to meet you.

Yeah, we were startin' to
think you were like Pearl.

Pearl?

Blake's imaginary friend.

Oh, from when he was little?


Hey, let's zip it.

You know what?

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

Oh!

This is what you get!

Oh!

Oh, oh, oh.

Are you okay?

Oh, oh, oh.

I'm (chuckles)...

Sorry.
It's all right.

It's okay (chuckles).

Yes, please, thank you.

I'm gonna need those.

Hey (speaking faintly).

Let's go.

(gasps) Oh my gosh!
Oh my God.

I'm so sorry, Nate.
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

[Veronica and Nate]
I didn't see you there.

(Veronica laughs)
(Nate laughs)

Oh...

Oh, thank you (chuckles).

Oh...

I thought you were
taking the week off

for some family fun time.

Yeah-

Daddy, can I have the markers?

Yes, you can.

Yes, here honey.

Here. There you go.

Hi, Veronica.

Hi.
I like your shoes.

Oh, these old things?

They feel just like
butter on my feet.

I'm kidding.

They're awful.

Don't ever throw
away your sneakers.

So what are you guys doing here?

We were just-

So what are you guys doing here?

Now dad wants to take us
to some boring museum.

Children's Museum.

So, hosting an event

where they celebrate
Christmas traditions

from around the world.

It's gonna be nonstop
food and drink.

Plenty of fun.

Just the opposite
of boring, Jessa.

And they have a make your
own wreath competition,

which is why we are gathering
some supplies from reception.

I hope that's not
an HR violation.

Well, last week I may
or may not have taken

some paper towels
from the break room

because I was too tired to
go to the grocery store,

so your secret's safe with me.

Okay.
Dad, I'm hungry.

Huh?
I'm hungry.

Right. Yes, yes, of course.

Well, how about we
get some takeout

from the Dragon on the way home?

savor those dishes.

I know, right?

Jim and Sue are like family.

It's been like my second home.

I thought this place
was your second home.

Ha ha (chuckles).

Sometimes it feels that way.

Well, that's how
you became CFO,

which is awesome, by the way.

Congratulations.

Not like me.

I'm just a lowly engineer.

Lowly engineer? No way.

Nate, you're brilliant.

You're one of the most talented
designers in the company.

Oh, thank you for saying that.

Daddy, look.

No, no, sweetheart.

No, no, no, no, no.

Do not do that.

Those are...


It's okay.

It's beautiful.

(gentle music)

(line trilling)


Hi, Sue.

I wanted to order
something for my mom.

Oh, I know your
interview is at three,

but is there time
for you to squeeze

in one more delivery
on your way?

(doorbell rings)
(Miguel knocking)

What are you doing here?

I didn't order anything.

This is for you.

This note came with it.

"Send

before the Dragon
closes this week."

Closes?

Sue never said a peep.

Yeah, it was a
shock to all of us.

(Jane gasps)

Okay, I'll see you later.

That's really unsafe.

I know, Jerry used to take
care of all those kinda things.

Let me fix that for you.

Really?
Yeah, yeah.


Okay, all set.

(Jane chuckles)

Thank you. Looks great.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

I'm running late for like

Now, if you'll excuse me,

(fabric rips)
(Miguel gasps)

Oh no!

Miguel, are you okay?

(Miguel sighs)
(playful music)

(gentle music)

Ms. Roberts, I am so sorry.

(Miguel sighs)

It is now 3:18.

I was working and I-
That's okay.

Let's just get on with it.

Cool?
Yeah.

Good grades,
great test scores.

Thank you, Ma'am.

But your extracurriculars,
where are they?

I work 30 hours a week,
plus all AP classes.

I don't exactly have time
for the debate team, so-

What about your
community service?

Volunteer positions?

Does playing bingo
with some feisty ladies

at the nursing home
count (chuckles)?

This scholarship is
given by my company

to someone who is involved
with their community

in a deep and meaningful way.

You're a nice young man, Miguel,

Thanks.
(phone ringing)

Hi, Mom.
Thank you for the moo shu.

I know how much you love it.

We had those lovely
Sunday night dinners

there with your dad.

On the rare occasions
when he would show up.

Well, the portions are so big,

wanna come over and
share it with me tonight?

How 'bout tomorrow?

I could help you
prep for the party.

Be there in the afternoon.

(phone beeps)

(phone beeping)
(Jane sighs)

(solemn music)

(Jane exhales)

Oh my gosh, I am so excited
for these roasts chestnuts.

They only have them
this time of year, Dad.

Like only once.

I know.

Like only once.

in cinnamon and sugar
or the spicy ones

that burn your tongue.

Which are your favorite?

that burn your tongue.

traditional of you.

I'm a traditional girl, Daddy.

You are, are ya?

Mom usually brings
us first thing

in the morning 'cause
they sell out fast.

Yeah, it'll be fine.
They're just chestnuts.

Um...

You've gotta be...

It's not even noon.

Told you, Dad.

Okay, a little less attitude
would be great, Jessa.

Having a fun vacation
would be great.

Are you?

All we've done is have fun.

Just because you take
us to lots of places

and spend lots of money on
us does not make it fun.

(solemn music)

Okay, fine.

I wanna practice my lines
for the Christmas pageant,

and just go home.

Okay.

Come on.

(music continues)

Sure this is your
childhood bedroom?

Pretty sure, yeah.

Sure this is your
childhood bedroom?

and they fit right back into
their teenage environment.

You know, like walls plastered
with posters of muscle cars,

shelves lined with trophies,
beds with Star War sheets.

I wasn't really
a Star Wars fan.

And we're supposed to
look at your yearbooks

and make fun of your haircuts.

You do that already.

Oh, and where is your desk?

I just use my
laptop on my bed.

Oh.

I always wanted a desk so bad,

because we were always at
the Dragon after school.

So they gave us the table
to do our homework at,

and not the good corner table,

but the bad one near
the men's bathroom.

I'm sorry, babe.

It's where I did my homework
every day after school.

It's where I studied
for the SATs.

It's where I found out I
got into NYU (chuckles).

It's where my first
boyfriend broke up with me.

Sounds like The
Golden Dragon means more

to you than you'd like to admit.

(melancholy music)

You are not going to
get me that easy, Blake.

No tears this holiday.

I am a ball of light and
love and holiday cheer.



Yes!
(Tinsley laughing)

That's what I'm talking about.

Woo!

Let's go!
Yes.

I think this room needs
some Christmas sparkle.

But babe, there's nothing
more Christmas than football.

Oh, I just thought
it would be fun

if we all built a
gingerbread house together.

But we're already
together watching football.

That's a great idea, Romy.

Let's all take a
break from the game.

(bright holiday music)

Maybe you didn't
add enough frosting.

I don't know, I've
never built one before.

Oh, oh!

(playful music)

(Romy sighs)

Oh, oh!

(music continues)

Yeah.

My first gingerbread house
was a complete disaster.

It wasn't a disaster, it
was just not up to code.

(phone ringing)

Oh, it's Rick.

I'm gonna go in.
Yeah.

(phone beeps)

Hey.
It is insanity over here.

I've only got a sec, but
I thought you should know,

even though Mom and Dad
don't want me to tell you.

This is sounding
pretty ominous.

Mom and Dad sold
the restaurant.

What?

Yeah, Christmas
Eve is our last night

and then we're closed forever.

(tray clattering)
(melancholy music)

Hey, someone just
dropped a whole tray

of steamed pork buns.

I gotta go.
Oh...

(music continues)

How's Rick?

My parents sold
the restaurant.

What?

Romy, I am so sorry.

Why didn't they tell me
sooner so that I could be there?

Are you okay?

(mischievous music)

Romy?

(music continues)


Oh no.

No way.

(Blake sighs)

Hey.
You finally got it fixed.

Yeah.

Go Mom, finding
your inner handyman.

No (chuckles), it was
actually the delivery driver

from The Golden Dragon.

He's such a nice young man.

He was even running
late for an interview

and he still volunteered
to fix it for me.

And then the poor kid
ripped his jacket.

Had to loan him one
of Daddy's suits.

(soft holiday music)

(Veronica sighs)

When are you getting
rid of Dad's old chair?

sat in that chair

every night reviewing
his playbook.

Well, you can redecorate now.

Make the house more you.

Maybe take down
some of Dad's stuff.

No, I'm proud of
his accomplishments.

You were a
brilliant architect.

The only woman on track
for partner at your firm.

You coulda kept working,

actually done something
that made you happy.

I wanna get your idea on
party decorations, please.

Used to be quite the crafter.

When I had a life
outside of work.

I remember staying up all
night with you before the party,

making hundreds of origami
snowflakes, you remember?

You were so relentless.

Had to make sure that every
fold was perfect and precise.

Where do you think I
learned that from, huh?

You should just relax this year.

Maybe even cancel.

People will understand.

I'm not canceling!

This party has
happened for 30 years.

Did you have your
appointment with Dr. Cohen?

Yep.


And nothing.

It didn't take.

Can you do another
round of IVF?

I've already done four.

The hormones are really messing
with my body and the cost,

well, I'd have to
get another promotion

in order to afford it,

but then I'll be
working too much

to even hang out with my kid.

I know what that's
like, all too well.

I'm sorry, Mom, I'm just...
(Jane sighs)

It's been a hard day.

Yeah, I know.

(bright holiday music)

(Nate sighs)

(Nate chuckles)

Time to write your
note to Santa.

No thanks.

We do this every year, Jessa.

Do you think Santa
knows about the time

I hid my brussel sprouts
in the bushes outside?

Or should I tell him about that?

I definitely wanna
be on the nice list.

It's not gonna happen.

You're naughty all the way.

Jessa, don't get your
tinsel in a tangle.

Gimme that tablet.

I'm almost at level 33.

Why don't we run your
lines for the pageant, hm?

Really?
Absolutely.

You said you were
getting nervous.

Okay.

You said you were
getting nervous.

We're standing up
because we always

must practice as we perform.

Okay.
Go for it.

"Let us...

Sweetheart?

It's okay.

You don't.

I?

Are you kidding me?

I don't?

You are looking at someone
who once took four semesters

of French to get out of one
semester of public speaking.

I couldn't even barely watch
somebody else speak publicly.

Really?

Yeah.

Then I got a job at this company

and I had to give a
lot of presentations,

You wanna know my secret?

Hey Romy, if you ever
wondered how much I love you,

this is proof.

I feel ridiculous.

You feel ridiculous?

So, how does this work?

Do I just go knock on the door?

I don't know.

I guess.
We've never done it before.

Okay, I'll go do it.

All right.

(playful music)

(baby cries)

We're here to sing carols.

Why?

To spread holiday cheer.

Nope.
(baby cries)

â™ª Good tidings we bring
to you and your kin â™ª

(kids laughing hysterically)

â™ª Oh, Christmas tree,
oh, Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª How lovely are thy branches â™ª

â™ª Oh, Christmas tree,
oh, Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª How lovely are thy branches â™ª

(solemn music)

(Romy sighs)

Sorry the caroling
was such a disaster.

I mean, I knew it would
be, but I'm still sorry.

What's the point of living
in this winter wonderland

if you're not swept up
in Christmas spirit?

Could this angst
have something

to do with The Golden
Dragon closing?

Of course not.

(bright holiday music)

Thank you.

I forget how beautiful
it can be here.

You can always move
back after graduation.

I already have a job lined up.

Huh, really?

Yeah, I interned
with this really

great political action
coalition over the summer,

so I'm going to start
as a coordinator,

get some experience
in a nonprofit space,

and then go to law school
and clerk for a judge

and then run for office.

Well, sounds like you've
got everything figured out.

I guess college just
caught up to me.

Soon I'll be
homeless and jobless.

Really nailing that life thing.

Maybe it's for the best.

I know, my parents
have worked hard.

They deserve a break.

Well, sure, but I meant
for the best for you.

Yeah?

I mean, you don't have
the best track record

for taking charge
of your future.

I can take charge.

(Rick laughs)
(Sadie laughs)

There's actually
something I've been dying

to do since I got back home.

If you're game?

You know, you are
gonna have to let go

of those presents at some point.

I'm fine just watching.

You know, my cousin told me

that you missed all of
your classes sophomore year

and that's why you flunked out.

I had everything
in high school,

Better schools, better jobs.

If you're not
happy with your life,

Change what you can
and work on the rest.

Take action.

Oh, oh (laughs)!

(bright holiday music)

When you promised
me a midnight snack,

this isn't quite
what I was thinking.

I need to
decompress after that.

And cooking is my meditation.

So there's this kid's
Christmas event happening

at the church tomorrow,

Kids in foster care will
create this wish registry

like a bridal or
a baby shower one,

and people will buy
the gifts anonymously

and then we wrap
them and have Santa

and his elves pass them out.

Sounds really nice.

Well, my cousin was
supposed to go with me,

but she's got the flu.

So, do you wanna be my plus one?

You'd have to dress up as a elf,

but I promise you the tights
are super comfortable.

Sounds like fun.

Minus the tights part.

Really?

I'd love to spend as much time

with you as I can
while you're home.

(light holiday music)

Nice job.

I see you're makin' progress.

Jack, I don't know how you
talk me into these things.

Well, you know, I usually
have my pal help me.

Pal, huh?


Is there a lady friend
I should know about?

It would take a
very special lady

to live up to my Margaret,

and I haven't met one yet
and I probably never will.

So, is this helper your
secret Santa gift or something?

It's Miguel.

Miguel?

From The Golden Dragon.

He shovels your snow?
Yes.

He cuts my grass, cleans my
ceiling fans, bears my gutters.

know, actually,

I gotta ask him about fixing
the screen on my back door.

Maybe power wash the back patio,
dust off the top cabinets.

Saw someone used
the grill last night

and didn't clean it again.

Sorry, dude.

I had Sadie over last night

and I totally
forgot to clean up.

Sadie? Nice, man.

When are you gonna
see her again?

Tonight.

I'm helping her hand out
gifts at this toy drive.

Tonight?

Are you crazy?

Your dad is gonna kill you.

Oh, no, no, no.

Your dad is gonna kill you.

I already already double
or large table reservations, es

so should be able to sneak out

for a couple hours
without anyone noticing.

You know, maybe it
wouldn't be the worst thing

your dad saw the mess,
found out that you cook.

Just like it wouldn't
be the worst thing

if your dad found out
you've been hiding

your college acceptance letters?

(bright holiday music)

Veronica.
Hey.

Hey, how are ya?

Good.

I don't think I've ever
seen you dress so casually.

You're always in a power suit.

(Veronica laughs)

What are you doin' here, Nate?

Well, I was just
dropping off the girls

at pageant practice and I
thought I'd surprise them

with their mom's famous
roast chicken, but-

I'm guessing that
didn't go so well?

No, no it didn't at all.

Let's just say
that a smoke alarm

may have been sacrificed
in the mayhem.

(Nate chuckles)
(Veronica chuckles)

So.

Don't try too hard
to be the fun parent.

Sometimes just being
there to listen is enough.

Wise words.

I know.


Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

Actually, you know, I
don't have to pick them up

for at least another hour.

Is there anywhere
you needed to be?

Are Jessa and Vivi
excited about the pageant?

Oh, Vivi's a total ham.

She cannot wait to be
the center of attention

and be right up on that stage.

Jessa on the other hand,

she suffers from
terrible stage fright.

So, any production she's ever
been a part of growing up

has always ended up
in complete disaster.


Speaking of which, what
are you doing tomorrow night?

There's an extra special
pageant happening

that you may know about.

The girls would be
psyched to see you.

You wanna come?

Oh Nate, I would love to,
but tomorrow's my mom's party.

I'm not really looking
forward to socializing

with a hundred of her
and my dad's friends,

but I need to be there for her.

And for you.

(dishes clattering)
(food sizzling)

Oh, there you are.

Are you going someplace?

Just a quick errand.

I'll be back before
the dinner rush.

No, no, no, I need
you in the kitchen.

Just 30 minutes.

I have to tell
Sadie that I can't-

Just 30 minutes.

Let me text her.

I'll promise you, you'll
get a break later, okay?

(solemn music)


I probably won't listen to this.

(music continues)

(door slams)

Hey man, everything okay?

return my calls.

I was supposed to meet her
at the church last night,

but I was stuck helping my dad.

I've blown my chance
with her, again.

time to open presents.

Oh, aren't we supposed
to open presents

on Christmas morning, not
10 a.m. on Christmas Eve?

The kids were always so
impatient with their presents

that they couldn't wait
till Christmas morning.

So, one year we decided

to let them open
presents a day early.

tradition just stuck.

Besides, we like to spend
our Christmas Eve night

at our favorite restaurant.

We've been going
there for years.

The Swan House.
Oh, sounds very elegant.

Oh, thank you.

(wrapping tearing)
(bright holiday music)

Oh, it's beautiful.

Thank you.
You're welcome, kiddo.

All right, all right,
time for my gift.

Oh, saving the best for last.

I can't wait to
see what's inside.

(music continues)

Do you like it?

Blake,

(music continues)

(Veronica exhales)

(melancholy music)

(Jane sighs)

(Veronica knocks)
(music continues)

Mom, where are you?

(Veronica knocks)
(music continues)

What happened to the party?


Not alone.

I emailed out a
cancellation to everyone.

Except me?
(Jane chuckles)

We both not
would've been buried

in your inbox until
St. Patrick's Day.

I'll give you that one.

It's okay, it's just a party.

It's not just a
party, it is my life.

I can't do this alone.

but we both know the truth.

Players needed him.

We needed him, too.

Your father was very
important to this community,

and I had to be supportive.

before you gave it
all up to become

some Division One coach's wife?

Veronica, raising a family

was the greatest joy in my life.

And your father was not perfect,

but he was my
partner for 30 years

and I can't just erase
all traces of him
the moment he dies.

Why don't we do something?

Go out?

I just...

I'd just like to be
alone tonight, please.

(Jane sighs)

(melancholy music)

Oh.

Do I want you or microwave
popcorn for dinner?

(Jack knocks)

Mom, I knew...

Do you need something?

I saw your lights were on.

How come you're not at your
mother's fancy shindig?

She canceled.

Oh, missin' your dad?

but my niece hid everything.

Oh, don't Scrooge out on me.

It's Christmas.

your physical therapist that.

I did.

The little dictator
deserved it, too.

(Veronica laughs)

Wow, somebody's getting
cozy with Mr. Claus.

I bought them all last
month in a fit of excitement

when I thought I might be...

Might be?

Oh.

But I'm not.

I just, I couldn't bear to
send them back just yet.

You know, Margaret and I
couldn't have children either.

I didn't know that, I
thought it was by choice.

Oh, we both come
from big families,

but wasn't in the cards.

How did you deal with it?

The disappointment?

14 nieces and nephews.

14?


And we had time to volunteer,

be parental figures
to those kids

who might not have anyone else.

Still.

Choosing to make
meaning out of a loss

is both empowering and healing.

Make this unexpected,

unplanned life meaningful
and fulfilling anyways.

(bright holiday music)

(music continues)

Scooch over.

Hey.
Hi.

I figured this was more
exciting than passing out

in a bag of eggnog ice cream
to some holiday movie marathon.

(Nate chuckles)
(Veronica chuckles)

Yeah.

You're just in time.

You got this, Jessa.

(anticipatory music)

(playful music)

Oh no.

Excuse me a second.

Sweetheart, Jessa?

Dad, what are you doing?

Remember what I taught you?

(anticipatory music)

(music continues)

"Let us now go unto Bethlehem

to see this thing
which has come to pass,

which the Lord have
made known unto to us.

Make haste in this
glorious night."

(gentle holiday music)

Yes, just right there
in the center banquet.

Enjoy your meal.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

(Sadie chuckles)

(gentle music)

All right, here's
the credit card slips.

I've gotta head off to church.

Okay.

Oh, what happened
with the interview?

You never told me how it went.

Total bust.

Maybe it's just not meant to be.

Hey, Sadie, I just
want to explain why-

Save it.

Hey, Sadie, I just
want to explain why-

And I'm the dumb one
who cares about you.

I've cared about you for years

because I'm 3,000 miles
away and it's easy.

You don't do hard, ever.

(bright holiday music)

(attendees chattering)

Oh, hey, Jessa.
Not now, Dad.

(Nate sighs)

Hey, Jessa, please.

What's wrong?

Could you be
more embarrassing?

What?

I thought it was helping.

(Nate sighs)

I can't seem to
do anything right.

Sometimes I feel like I'm
just not cut out for this.

Nate.
(Luis speaking in Spanish)

Miguel.

We're late already.

Ms. Roberts, good
to see you again.

Merry Christmas.

You too, Miguel.

Merry Christmas.

You must be Luis.

I'm Nate.

Pleasure to finally meet you.

Hello, Nate.

How do you know my son?

One too many orders of
sesame chicken (chuckles).


The Chens have been
wonderful to Miguel.

where he can flourish.

Okay, Papa, let's
go get a seat.

Luis, you should
be incredibly proud

of the man you raised.

He goes above and
beyond every single day.

Even looked after my kids once
when I was late coming home

from the airport
at the restaurant.

You remember that, Miguel?
Yeah.

Thank you.

I still lawyer you for that.

Anytime.

I still lawyer you for that.

Yeah, sure.

So, you may not
have a resume full

of sports and debate team
and co-op internships,

but that doesn't mean you don't
care about your community.

You've helped my
mom, Mr. Barber.

(Veronica chuckles)
(Miguel chuckles)

Surely countless other people.

I may have made
the wrong judgment

about you on our
first interview.

First? Does does that mean-

This means you get
another interview.

A do over, But you better
not be late this time.

Okay, I promise.

Okay.

holiday ham, not Peking duck.

Chinese food on Christmas Eve.

Evening folks.

Have we decided?

Evening folks.

So let's do the orange chicken,

the crab rangoon, pot stickers,

chopped suey, egg foo young,

oh, and the Mongolian beef.

Great choices.

Romy, Blake told us all about

your family's
restaurant closing.

I know that must be hard.

Now, Jade Palace may not
live up to The Golden Dragon,

but we wanted to
share it with you.

What was your family
restaurant like growing up?

Is Christmas as
crazy as it is here?

Oh, definitely (chuckles).

There were so many people,

nurses and doctors,
international students,

people who couldn't afford
to fly home for the holidays.

And because of the Dragon,

they had some place
to spend Christmas

along with all the other
holiday orphans in town.

We made a family, and
made new traditions.

sounds lovely, Romy.

Yeah, actually it was.

(gentle music)

This Nate, he sure
thinks highly of you.

Yeah, he's a great guy, so.

Mm hm.

And the woman he was with,

what did you two sneak
off to talk about?

She's the administrator

of the scholarship I applied to.

I actually think I might have
a chance of getting it, so.

Papa?

(gentle holiday music)

How long have you had these?

A few weeks.

(Miguel speaking in Spanish)

(Luis speaking in Spanish)

It's a terrible feeling

to see a child's dreams sleep
away because I'm a failure.

Are you serious?

You're not a failure.

You're the kind of
man I want to be,

the kind of man who sacrifices
everything for his family.

Yeah, sometimes it's
better to be selfish.

Now are we going to
look at these at schools

and burning our marshmallows?

Wow.

Oh, excuse me.

The paramedic that's
waiting for her food,

would you please put
her order on our bill,

and tell her that it's a thank
you from her secret Santa.

Wow, that's very nice.

Not everyone gets to be near

their loved ones
during the holidays.

(gentle music)

You all are amazing and I'm
so sorry, but I have to go.

Home.

To Kansas.

(music continues)

I'll book your flight.

I'll drive you to the airport.

I'll make snacks for the road.

I'll help you pack.

I'll lend you my new
noise canceling headphones

for the plane.

And I'll go with you.

Really?


(all laughing)
(emotional music)

enjoying Christmas morning.

(bright holiday music)

(music continues)

(phone chimes)

(melancholy music)

Rick, right here.

Romy, what are you doing?

Shh, I don't want
Mom and Dad to see.

Why?

Because we're opening
the restaurant today.

We're what now?

Mom and Dad don't
realize how important

the Dragon is to
this town, and to me.

All those people who depend on
us for their Christmas meals,

the ones who are alone
or lost or abandoned,

or just want a nice meal
that they don't have to cook,

where will they go today?

Who will feed them?

We already gave the
staff the day off.

So we'll find temporary staff.

I'll be the chef.

Yes!

Good.

You already knew about that?

I have spies all
over the Dragon.

Oh.

You must be Blake.

Hey, nice to finally
meet you, man.

You too, Rick.

Hey, nice to finally
meet you, man.

Romy's a little
tired of the one dish

I know how to make and I hear

you have insane cooking skills.

I'd be totally down for that.

Let me grab a jacket.
Go.

We're gonna do it.

Okay.
(Romy squeals)

(Blake laughs)

Can't believe you got me this.

Yeah, well, you
mentioned it awhile ago.

Probably totally uncool by now,

but I think it's pretty awesome.

You were talking
about how you wanted

to try to make some jewelry, so.

I didn't think you'd remember,
or that you were listening.

I'm always listening, kiddo.

I'm sorry, Dad, for yelling
at you after the pageant

and just being a
really big brat lately.

I've just been kinda
sad since Mom left.

Your mom will be home soon.

I know, but then
we'll live in two houses

and have two birthdays and have

to pick between
you guys for stuff.

You never have
to pick between us.

Me and your mom may not
be together anymore,

but we'll still
always be a family.

I'll tell you what,

why don't we try to make Mom's
famous cinnamon buns, hm?

Yeah.

(gentle holiday music)

Get your own bowl
of cereal, stealer.

Where did I put the...

No. Oh!

Ah ha.

make cinnamon rolls
like your mom,

so I think it's time we
start a new tradition.

(Vivi laughs)
(bright holiday music)

Oo.

(girls laughing)

(music continues)

(music continues)

Romy, why aren't
you in Vermont?

Slight change of plans.

We're opening up
the Dragon today.

We need your help.

I'd love to, but
it's Christmas.

He will be there.

You're okay with me leaving
the family on Christmas?

The Chen's have treated
you like a son for years.

That makes them
part of our family,

and we don't let family down.

(bright holiday music)

(doorbell rings)

Merry Christmas.

Mom.

Hi, what are you doing here?

I mean, Merry Christmas.

So, how's your morning been?

I've definitely lost the
touch over the past few years.

Oh, honey, you have
so many other talents.

Don't focus on the one
thing you're not perfect at.

Thanks, Mom.

Of course I did.

I want you to have this.

You didn't have
to do this, Mom.

Just open it.

I want you to know who I was

before I became a wife or a mom.

You were a partner?

Well, technically I
didn't accept the promotion.

I would've had to live
in Copenhagen for a year,

and that was right when your dad

was offered the
head coaching job.

(Jane chuckles)
(melancholy music)

I didn't call him back.


Dad.

Two days before
his heart attack,

he dropped off a brochure,
some cruise in Europe.

I was focused on a
project and I figured

it was just the
same old routine,

making promises he
would never keep.

No.

He wanted me to
finally see Copenhagen,

and Paris and Prague
and all those places

that I always
dreamed of visiting.

He felt guilty, but
he didn't need to.

I knew what I was giving up,

but I also knew
what I was getting.

(Veronica chuckles)

He left me a voice message.


He sounded really sad and
he really wanted to meet up.

But I, well, I was angry
and I didn't call him back.

And then he was gone,

and now I'm just gonna be a
disappointment to you too.

Oh, no!
I'll never make

you a grandmother.

Honey, I am so proud of you.

And you'll get through
this and I will be there

every step of the
way right with you.

Okay?

Oh.

(phone ringing)

Okay.

Merry Christmas.

Right now?

Sure, I could do that.

Can I bring a plus one?

This is good.

Mm.

I think I even like this
better than sour gummies.

(Nate chuckles)

How about tomorrow we'll go
get doughnuts and go sledding?

I call the biggest hill first.

(phone ringing)

Hello, this is...

Oh, hey Miguel.

Yeah, sure, no problem.

We're on our way.

You guys, get your coats on.

Our friends need us.

Let's go.

Thank you all so
much for dropping

your Christmas
plans to come here.

It's going to be out of
all of our comfort zones,

but I think we owe the
Dragon one last hurrah.

We're gonna be busy.

Insane is more like it.

We already have dozens of
reservations for dinner.

Our usual vendors are closed,

so we're gonna have to make do

with grocery meat and produce.

Romy and Blake, they're gonna
be on kitchen duty with me.

Nate, I'm gonna need
you to grab the sauce bins

from the fridge and fill
up all the dispensers.

Right.

from the fridge and fill
up all the dispensers.

so I'm gonna put you on dicing.

Hm.

Jess and Vivi,
I'm gonna teach you

how to make the best hand
rolled dumplings ever.

Luis, I'm going to
need you to be mingling

in the dining room
entertaining our guests.

And what about me?

Host stand.

You wanna waste all this
pizazz on the host stand?

(all laughing)

You wanna waste all this
pizazz on the host stand?

so our novice kitchen staff
doesn't get overwhelmed.

Oh, so I get to tell
people what to do.

Yes, but only
if you wear this.

Oh!
(all laughing)

May, I (throat clears)?

Wow.
That's perfect.

Let's get started.

Ready.

Let's go.
Come on.

Here you are, a
fish fileting guru,

and yet for our first dinner,

you made me microwave popcorn?

Maybe I just
forgot how fun it is

to cook for people you love.

We have to break
them off like this

and throw them in here?

Okay.
Like it's a big tree

and you're taking
the branches off.

You're a natural.

Oh!
(knife thuds)

(knife chopping)
(upbeat holiday music)

All right.
You watching?


All right, you get a bundle.

Okay.

And stir it.
That's it?

That's all I have to do?

That's it,

and just wait a minute.
I can do that.

Oh, oh!
Jeez, all right.

Hey, guys, guys, hey, hey,

break it up, break it up,
break it up, break it up.

Dude, you're leaving?

There's just a stop
I have to make.

Well, what's more
important than this?


What?

I don't think I can
live with regret.

(gentle music)

(music continues)

(Rick exhales)

Rick?

What are you doing here?

And why are you dressed
like a 1980s wedding singer?

This was the last tie
they had at the shop.

Will you please go

to the Dragon tonight
at eight wearing this?

And that dress I never
got to see you in?

Sadie Cohen,

will you go to prom with me?

(gentle music)

(music continues)

You know, you can't
just do one big gesture

and then expect
everything to be forgiven.

I know that,

which is why I just
want this to be

the first teensy eensy littlest
possible step towards that.

That's it.

(music continues)

(all chattering)

Ta da.

My table.

So this is where
all the magic happens?

All the major milestones
in my life happened here.

Care to add one more?

Are you asking me what
I think you're asking me?

Because I am going
to be so mad at you

that my engagement
selfie is of me

in a sesame oil stained shirt.

Life isn't perfect.

Christmas isn't perfect,
couples aren't perfect.

But sometimes it's
the imperfections

that make something
so worthwhile.

You're right.

I want all the messy and
difficult and awkward things.

I wanna learn and grow and
remember and be grateful.

I wanna do all of that with you.

Romy Chen, will you marry me?

(Romy giggles)
(bright music)

(Romy laughs)

You may say there are
no perfect Christmases,

but I beg to differ.

(Blake laughs)

I love it.
You do? Good.

I love it.
(Blake laughs)

I can't believe
that kid sneaking out

on Christmas and making me
come out in the cold like this.

He's lost, Jim.

He's still searching for his...

(customers chattering)

(bright holiday music playing)

What's going on?

Your last dinner service.

Mom, Dad, I'll take
you to your table.

This way.

How did you pull this off?

It was mostly Romy's idea.

Romy?

I may be jet lagged and
I definitely need a shower,

but I would never miss
our last Christmas here!

Oh, Romy!

I invited some regulars.

Plus I texted every phone number

from last year's
Christmas reservations.

I might have carpal tunnel,

but it got us a
pretty decent crowd.

Oh, you didn't have
to do this for us.

You've served all of
us all of these years,

now it's time for
you to be served.

Ah, Ma, this is Blake.

Blake, meet my
wonderful parents.

Blake!

Hi (laughs).

Why aren't you
with your family?

Well, Romy is family now.

We're engaged!

Oh, Romy! That's wonderful.

Don't worry, the
real ring's coming

Welcome to the family, son.
(Romy laughs)

(all laughing)

Come, come.
All right, all right.

(light jazzy holiday music)

Wow.

I can't believe I almost missed
seeing you in this dress.

I can't believe this dress
still actually fits me.

(Rick chuckles)

Don't leave me alone on
the dance floor, Rick Chen.

No, Ma'am.

(music continues)
(all chattering)

(upbeat music)
(singer vocalizing)

Oh, what is this?

Can I please have this dance?

(music continues)
(singer vocalizing)

(all applauding)

â™ª Got a little piece of heaven â™ª

So, I was thinking that
I might check out LA

and see if I can find a job
as a sous chef somewhere.

Do you know anyone with a couch
that I could crash on maybe?

I want you in my life, Sadie.

And if that means friendship,

and nothing romantic would
ever happen, that's fine.

That the price I pay.

â™ª Century â™ª

â™ª You hold me like a
century, century, century â™ª

Okay.
(Sadie chuckles)

(singer vocalizing)
(music continues)

Oh, ah!

(Veronica laughs)

I'm gonna have the best
story to tell for the,

"What I did for my
Christmas vacation"

portion of the
company newsletter.

Don't you dare.

(Veronica laughs)
(Nate laughs)

Oh!
(upbeat holiday music)

(music continues)

â™ª We wish you a
Merry Christmas â™ª

â™ª We wish you a
Merry Christmas â™ª

Hm.

Pretty impressive.

is important,

but you have got to get
the basics down too.

You can show me
some tricks sometime.

I'd like nothing better, Son.

Thanks, Dad.

(Luis speaking in Spanish)

We understand that this tree

has ornaments from all
your customers and friends.

(Luis speaking in Spanish)

Before you turn that
sign to close for good,

we would like to
give you something.

Me abuelito, my
grandfather gave me this

when I was just a boy.

We were leaving Guadalajara

on Christmas Eve
to come to America,

and he knew then
that we probably

would not see each other again.

(speaking in Spanish)
Saint Christopher

I remember that feeling

when we left our homes
to come to the U.S.

It was pure hope and pure
fear at the same time.

I was so anxious
that I accidentally

wore two different
shoes on the flight.

(all laughing)

I remember that (laughs).

I made this in preschool
when I was two or three.

I made this special for you.

Thank you.

This is symbolic
so that I remember

to love myself as much
as I love anyone else.

My mom got this from
me after my dad won

his first NCAA tournament game.

She was so proud of him,

but of course I never even
took it out of the box.

My dad loved it here,

Even though I didn't show it.

(bright holiday music)

Oh, honey.

(music continues)

We'll remember
that wherever we are,

this family with us.

(music continues)

(music continues)


Christmas looks
different for everyone.

Maybe it's embracing the change

to create new traditions,
So impressive

you're bilingual.

to create new traditions,
So impressive

a part of achieving our dreams.

It could be letting
go of expectations

around what you think
the holidays should be.

Pushing forward with
resilience and hope

to create a new normal,

and understanding that our
challenges don't define us.

Christmas makes us realize we
may actually find everything

we want if we adjust
our perspective.

And it doesn't matter if
we throw festive parties,

or watch football, or
even roll dumplings.

It's Mom.

or watch football, or
even roll dumplings.

if you spend it with family,

because the greatest gifts
can't be traveled to,

owned, earned,
worn, or consumed.

The greatest gift we can
give ourselves and others

is living in the present,

and being grateful
for the lessons

we've learned
throughout the year.

And maybe fry a few egg
rolls while you're at it.
