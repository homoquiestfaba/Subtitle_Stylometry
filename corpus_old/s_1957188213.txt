("Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"
by Nina Simone playing)

â™ª Baby, you understand me now â™ª

â™ª If sometimes you see
that I'm mad â™ª

â™ª Don't you know no one alive
can always be an angel? â™ª

â™ª When everything goes wrong,
you see some bad â™ª

â™ª But I'm just a soul â™ª

â™ª Whose intentions are good â™ª

â™ª Oh, Lord, please don't let me
be misunderstood â™ª

â™ª You know, sometimes, baby,
I'm so carefree â™ª

â™ª And then you're bound to see
my other side â™ª

â™ª But I'm just a soul â™ª

â™ª Whose intentions are good â™ª


â™ª Oh, Lord, please don't let me
be misunderstood. â™ª

Who the fuck are you?

Me?

I'm...

We don't want any trouble.

Your money. Cash.

Now!

Th-That's about all there is,
on that.

That-that's it?

I use a debit card.

Jesus.

MAN:
I didn't find anything.

What about his watch?

WOMAN:
Is this worth something?

To me, it is.

Take it.

WOMAN:
Give me your ring.

Give me your fucking ring!

BRADY: Hey!
(groaning)

Hey! Hey, get off him! Now!

Get off him! Get off him!

I swear to God,
I'll fucking shoot you!

BRADY:
Dad!

(groaning)
WOMAN: Now!

Let him go, son.
(Brady grunting)

What?
(man gasping)

I said let him go.


Hey!
What? What?

BECCA:
Please stop.

Just take what you want and go.
Please just...

Just shut up!

Let's get out of here.

Baby, let's go.
(grunts in frustration)

We picked the wrong
fucking house.

Just... fucking shit!
Shut up.

HUTCH: <i>I can't believe
I let this happen.</i>

<i>My beautiful wife,</i>

<i>beautiful kids, my home,</i>

<i>broken into with a freaking...</i>

Mr. Mansell.
Excuse me?

So, that's how they got in, huh?

Using a pizza box?

Yeah.

And the golf club?

Did you even take a swing?

She had a, uh...

Could've taken her, Dad.

Look, you did the right thing,
Mr. Mansell.

You know, if that was
my family... (chuckles)

We're gonna get out
of your hair.

You just leave that
garage door closed, okay?

â™ª â™ª

(car doors closing)

(cars departing)


â™ª â™ª



Hey, Dad.

Hey, kiddo.

You couldn't sleep?
No.

Well...

Oh. (exhales)

You scared?

Why would I be?
You're here.

Yeah.

Dad?

Yeah?

We need a cat.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Yeah.

I was thinking the same thing.

(garbage truck beeping,
rattling)


Come on!

(groans)
(horn honking)

Fuck!


So, uh, I have to do a report
on a veteran for history class.

Think I could just
interview you?


Yeah, sure, son. Um...

you know, I was an auditor,
so kind of a nobody.

That makes for
a pretty dry story.

Yeah, I-I really don't...
don't care.

Just want to finish up
the project and call it a day.

What about your uncle Charlie?

He was a real soldier.

I didn't mean it.

Oh, your mom's right.

Hey, you know what, uh,

I actually already
left him a message.

I'll try again later.

Could try Grandpa.

He actually saw some action.

Yeah, maybe.

HUTCH:
Have a great day.

BECCA:
Oh, and, um...

you missed the garbage.


(Becca sighs softly)

Oh, I took all the coffee.


Have a good day, Hutch.

Yeah, you, too.

All right, kids, let's go.
Come on.

Let's go.

(door bangs open)

(door closes)

(engine rumbling)

BECCA:
Put on your seat belt, okay?

Hold on.

Hey.

Heard you had some excitement
last night.

Yeah, it was just, uh...

Man, I wish they'd have picked
my place, you know?

Could've used the exercise.

(car engine starts)
That's new.

Pretty cool, huh?

Yeah, the old man croaked.

He didn't have much to leave,

but at least I got
something out of it.

Honey, come on.

Got to go.

I'm sorry for your loss.
(scoffs)

There's nothing there
to mourn, man.

Pretty slick, though, huh?

The '72 Challenger,
4.9-liter V-8.

Zero to 60 in...
I'm about to find the fuck out.

CHARLIE:
So...

Good morning, Charlie.

Did I hear right?

Depends who you talked to.

Well, your boy called.

Then, yeah, you heard right.

Now, he says that you had
the drop on one of them.

Why didn't you take 'em out?

I mean, shit...

(lid clicks)
it's child's play.

I was just trying to keep damage
to a minimum.

Oh, yeah?
How's that working out for you?

Everybody's safe, so...
Jesus!

Don't worry.

Safety's on.

No, wait.

Oops. There.
(safety clicks)

There. See?

Now, there's nothing that
turns out the lights right quick

like a fucking bullet
to the brain, man.

So... take it.

I don't want it.

It ain't a matter of want,
Hutch.

It's the principle of need.

So, keep my sister safe, bro.

(Charlie shaking bottle)

(sighs softly)

(ice rattling)

Hey.

Oh, hey.

Uh, I take it Becca called you.

She did.

And I'm thinking you did
the best thing you could.

I mean, you being you.

Yeah. I got you.

Look, let's talk about you
wanting to buy this place.

Do you really want to get rid
of me and Charlie that bad?

Eddie, you're family.

I just want you to enjoy
your retirement

and Charlie his youth.

It's a fair offer.

But not a great one, you know.

Look, I built this place up
from nothing with my hands.

If I'm going to sell it,
then I want it to be a...

goddamn great offer.

You know?
Yeah.

with this place, anyway?

Guess I just want something
that's mine, you know?

I do.

Hey, Hutch.

I'm rooting for you.

HUTCH: Sounded good.

HARRY (over radio):
How long you been listening?

Long enough to know you're
getting mighty good at that.

When you're officially dead,

got a lot of free time
on your hands, you know?

Rough life.

So, tell me about last night.

(chuckles quietly)

Word travels fast, huh?

(over radio): Look,
if they know, I know, you know?

There were two of them.

A man and a woman.

Uh, late 20s, I'd say.

(inhales deeply)

(clicks tongue)
They were scared.

Desperate.

She had a gun.

What kind?

Uh, it was an old .38 Special.


Had electrical tape
on the handle.

<i>It was a Smith & Wesson.</i>

<i>Hadn't been shot
in a long while.</i>

<i>And it was, uh...</i>

...empty.

Seriously?
Seriously.

Hmm. Now I know why you
didn't do what you didn't do.

<i>What'd they get?</i>

HUTCH (chuckling):
<i>Not much. Just a couple bucks.</i>

HARRY: <i>Well, I guess it
could've been worse, man.</i>

HUTCH:
<i>Yeah.</i>

HARRY: <i>Look, I know what
you're thinking about,</i>

Do you remember who
we used to be, Hutchie?

I do.

(dogs barking in distance)

â™ª â™ª


Hey, buddy.

How was school?

Fine.

Hi, sweetheart.

Come on. Help out.

How was today?

It was what it was.
I can't find it.

BECCA: Ugh.
You can't find what?

My kitty cat bracelet.

Where was it?

In here.

They couldn't have stolen that,
would they?


â™ª â™ª

BECCA: Honey, I'm sure
it'll turn up somewhere.

(door bangs open)

Back so soon?

Hey, Pop.

There's this thing I got to do.

Then you best go do it.

Your I.D.... the badge expired

Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that ain't you in the photo.

So...

Who are you?

I'm just a man...

who's looking for someone.

Yeah, well,
you probably shouldn't

flash cheese like that
around here, bro.

There are three types of people
who, as you say, "flash cheese":

people who don't know
any better,

people who are seeking
to intimidate,

and people like me, who wish
with every fiber of their being

that someone would try
to take it from them.

Uh...

Thank you for your service.

You, too, old-timer.

I swear to God, I don't know.

The goddamn bracelet.
I'll help you find it!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Swear to God, I don't know.

About what?

HUTCH:
About...

Becca. (groans)

How we haven't embraced

We haven't shared a kiss in...
I don't know.

We haven't had sex in months.

We haven't made love in years.

HARRY:
Last night, that was you, huh?

I thought we said no landlines.

Relax. I got 30 seconds.

Okay, well, go.

So, how did it feel?

Like salvation day.

Yeah, I bet.

Look, I'm happy that your
relapse made you feel so good,

but, man, you got a fucking problem.
Yeah?

One of those guys was the
brother of Yulian Kuznetsov,

and you don't want
to fuck with him, Hutch.

I'm serious.
Ask The Barber. He knows.

It was an isolated incident,
sir.

Yulian Kuznetsov.
Ask The Barber.

BECCA:
Who was that?

Just a distributor of ours.

Hey, I have an idea.

How about I make that lasagna
that you love tonight?

Lasagna!

Mr. Mansell.

It has been some time.

That it has.

What, pray tell,
may we do for you, good sir?

What can you tell me
about Yulian Kuznetsov?

Am I really now
that predictable?

From where I sit, Mr. Mansell,

everyone is.

Short story long,
he's as bad as they come.

<i>A connected, funded sociopath</i>

<i>with resources
to make things complicated.</i>

So, he's a bad guy?

Has he got any hobbies?
Collects art,

<i>to the tune of eight
and nine figures.</i>

Anything good?

Fuck if I know.

But what I do know is,

if he doesn't know
who you are yet,

<i>he will soon.</i>

What have you got for me?

I found his dad.

He's got him at
a nursing home downtown.

That's not much.

I wouldn't worry
about this Hutch guy.

Your man here looks to be
as vanilla as they come.

If you can't recognize a wolf
in sheep's clothing,

I question the viability
of your employment here.

I have a friend at the Pentagon.

I'll keep looking.

One blackmail package coming up.

What the fuck?


What?

THE BARBER:
<i>And if he can't take care</i>

<i>of a loose end like you,</i>

he'd have to give up
his share of the Obshak.

The Obshak?

Think of it like the 401(k)

<i>of the Russian mob.</i>

<i>That's hundreds of millions
of dollars in cash</i>

<i>perpetually on the move,</i>

<i>and Yulian is
the current babysitter.</i>

That said, he's more than
a bit weary of this life.

I think, if he had his way,
he'd probably walk away.

Right. There you go.

Hey, how about we all head
to Italy this summer?

We've always talked
about going back.

Oh, I'd love that.

But, um, can we afford it?

I guess the real question is:
Can we afford not to?

Well, that would be wonderful.
Yeah.

'Cause, you know,
Rome is where Mom and Dad met.

You know, Mom and Dad

A couple of chapters back, um,

there was this guy named Alan.

Aaron.

No, it was Alan.

<i>Alan skimmed
about three million bucks</i>

<i>from a U.S. military base
in Rivolto, Italy,</i>

<i>and his prize was me
looming over him</i>

<i>with a Walther PPK.</i>

<i>No, wait.</i>

<i>Uh, it was a suppressed</i>

<i>H&K USP .45
at the back of his head.</i>

<i>And he started begging,
like they all do,</i>

<i>and I usually pulled the trigger
before the waterworks began,</i>

<i>but this time I listened.</i>

<i>(sighs) I heard a man who
genuinely regretted his choices</i>

<i>and wanted nothing more
than to shed his wolf skin</i>

<i>and return to the pasture
as a lamb.</i>

<i>I quietly let Alan go.</i>

<i>A year later,
I went back to check on him,</i>

<i>fully expecting to find him
back unto the fold.</i>

<i>Alan was living in Boise, Idaho.</i>

<i>He had a wife.</i>

<i>She came with two kids.</i>

<i>They had another on the way.</i>

<i>They had a dog.</i>

<i>He was working 9:00 to 5:00.</i>

<i>Nothing there to skim.</i>

<i>And he was smiling.</i>

<i>(laughing):
Like a goddamn Buddha.</i>

That motherfucker!

I am not a jealous guy,

but in that moment,
I wanted what Alan had.

So I told my bosses
I was out of the game.

They were not happy to hear it.

They didn't believe
I could do it.

(song ends)
(sighs)

I gave it my all.

I really did.

It was good.
(pulls record from sleeve)

You know, it was better
than I expected.

I might have, uh, overcorrected.

But...

Sneaky devil.

Fucking kitty cat bracelet.



Fun fact:

Bone burns to ash
at 1,500 degrees,

and this basement is designed
to double that,

so they won't be finding you
among the rubble.

Deep down, I always knew
it was a facade.

It lasted a lot longer
than I expected.

Cute.


You have some nerve

Yeah. Maybe.

What say you and I
have a moment?

â™ª â™ª

Now, on the one hand,

there's a long-dormant
piece of me now awake

that wants so very badly
to play this out.

The other,
more reasonable piece of me...

what's left of it...

would like to end our little
tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte right now.

What's done is done.

After all,
we can both rebuild, right?

Right.

Mm, wait. Rebuild?

I burned it... all of it.

What all?

Everything you have.

Had.

Everything you had.

My art?

(bangs table)
Obshak!

You should've seen it go up.

It was something.

I mean, if this doesn't
make us even...

because, after all,
you came to my house,

which you know
you don't fucking do!

You killed my brother.

The last I saw,
he was still breathing.

And based on what little
I know of the man,

that's probably more
than he deserved.

Now...

you can come after me,

and if you succeed
in taking me down,

well, you're still obligated
to refinance the entire Obshak,

which begs the question...
can you?

Do you even want to?

'Cause I've heard
that you want out.

What better time than right now?

Let's both quit.

Right? You got a nest egg.

I mean, besides from what's
still smoldering.

So, hmm?

Get some work done.

Maybe, uh, open a tiki bar

in one of the lesser-known
Caribbean islands

and live your life
far from me and mine.

Think it over.

I'll be nearby.
