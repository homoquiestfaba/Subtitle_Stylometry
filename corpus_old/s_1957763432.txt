English?

An Englishwoman.

Are you hungry?

Well, no. It's over.

They've had enough.

Here we are, we've arrived.

The great House of Dior.

Good luck, English lady.

Hold them back as best you can.
She won't be long, I'm sure.

Excuse me, Madame.

Clumsy girl!

AndrÃ©, what is going on?
I could have been hurt!

Are you all right?
Don't touch me!

Careful, careful, careful!

Ah, the Countess.

Good day, Baroness
von Tiesenhausen.

Hello, Madame.

Hello, Madame.

Here you are.

Madame Avallon! Such
elegance, as always.

Mathilde, how you've changed.

How has this unfortunate
creature been allowed in?

The woman is clearly deranged.

A department store.

Have her removed at once.

It's real money, Madame Colbert.

If only everyone
could do the same...

Today, Monsieur Dior will reveal
his 10th Anniversary Collection.

Nothing must detract
for this occasion.

Girls, you will never
believe what's just happened.

There's a cleaning lady from
London who's going to buy a dress.

A cleaning lady?
Yes, a Dior gown!

She arrived with all her money.

And Madame Colbert didn't
know where to put herself.

Natasha, you must come and
see her. She's so wonderful!

Look! Look!

Ladies.

She saved up all her
pennies to come and see us!

There she is, just next to
the Marquis de Chassagne.

You see?

What's going on?

Back to work!

Quick!

This can't be true.

Her again!

This won't do.

I'm sorry, Madame Avallon.

We will find you a
more suitable seat.

No! These are our usual seats.

We will endure this indignity
but it won't end here.

Number one,

the Bar Suit.

Number two,

Number three,

Number four, Cocotte.

Number 42, Cabaret.

Dinner dress in
champagne satin chiffon.

Cocktail dress in black
satin with white polka dots.

Sales girl?

You know our arrangements.

Yes, Madame Avallon,
how can I help you?

I've made my choice.

Very good, Madame Avallon.
Temptation, number 89.

Yes. Yes, exactly.

The atelier has nothing to do.

But to devote itself
to this one order?

A cash sale, Madame.
Given our circumstances...

Very well, Monsieur Fauvel. It
seems you are in charge now.

Off you go. Don't
just stand there.

Quick, quick, quick.

Thirteen.

Eighty-two.

Sixty-two.

What's happened?

I am embarrassed beyond words
that you have seen the state of...

I haven't had time to...

No, please, it was nothing.

Allow me...

I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

No, it's me, I shouldn't have...

Frog in the...?

In the ditch.

Being and Nothingness.

You are reading Sartre?

I need to speak to you about
some of the alterations

requested by Princess Margaret.

Let's go, Monsieur CarrÃ©.

Where are you?

Sorry.

No, it doesn't work.

Stupid cretin!

Idiot! Clear off!

Out! Out! Avallon out!

Avallon, you dirty stinker!

Chuck him in the bin!

So, Monsieur CarrÃ©...

Mrs Harris?

Are you all right?

Mrs Harris asked if
she's gone to heaven.

Ladies!

Quick, quick. Back to work!

Do you think this fabric
could work well for Aphrodite?

Yes, I love the color.

May I show Monsieur CarrÃ©?
Certainly.

Monsieur CarrÃ©, this fabric
is even more luxurious.

Perhaps we could use it for...?

We have found some common
ground, the little sparrow and I.

She's a capable seamstress.

What could go
wrong with buttons?

Cheers!

Avallon, dirty boss!

Avallon, in the bin!

We will make you rot, Avallon!

Please!

Stay here!

Marguerite, what's got into you?

You stay here!

This is all your fault,
Monsieur Fauvel. Do something.

Do you think I can
stop this woman?

Arrest her!

I'm a communist,
Madame. I'm on her side.

Let me pass!

Monsieur Dior, I am sorry.

A world without elegance,

without distinction,
without Dior,

no, it's impossible.

Yet how can the House of Dior
surmount its current problems?

That would no longer
be the House of Dior.

It would no longer
be haute couture.

Our reputation is founded
on our exclusivity.

Stop, Loulou.

Monsieur Fauvel, you
have ten minutes.

And you as well.

We've won the strike!

Throw Avallon in jail!

Here's to the workers!

Ten years ago, when the House of
Dior presented its first collection,

exclusivity was key, it's true.

Madame Colbert, I beg you.

Who's there?

It's nothing, don't
worry. I'll be right back.

What do they want?

Don't worry.

The most intelligent, the most
adorable woman you've ever seen.

That one over there?

What happened?

Existentialists!

Stay in Paris with me, Natasha.

But I have already
told Monsieur Dior.

You can still study philosophy.

To make the invisible visible.

You've got it wrong! Stop!

It's a mistake, I'm telling you!

Eighty-five.

Office of Christian
Dior. I'm listening.

Could you wrap these up please?
