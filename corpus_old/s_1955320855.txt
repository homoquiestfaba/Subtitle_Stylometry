Her son was in kindergarten
Manhattan Beach

been sexually abused.
The child named Raymond Charles...

The suspect crossed
just the parking lot.

Passing a group of schoolchildren,

The suspect has stopped.
He sees the children at play.

He is alone,
he tried to address the children.

And now the latest news of the day.
Good evening throughout Southern California

From the desert to the south coast.
Here are the 6 o'clock news.

First to a case in the
young children in an almost incredible

And shockingly implicated.
Our reporter Wayne sentence portrays now

In an exclusive report this
extraordinary story. Wayne...

The report is based on the statements
more than 60 children. And some

Currently only 2 years old.
You should a dreadful secret

keep  itself.
This was now revealed.

You have been sexually abused and...
acted in pornographic movies with.

All children attended this...
Hi, it's me, Kelly.

Do you see the news?
Yes, call me back in again.

... The nursery is run by the 76-year
Virginia McMartin,

The most deserving citizen
Manhattan Beach.

This video shows the...
Well, honey?

Look at this.

You shall not see this.
To me there is nothing more

As the smiles and love
a small child.

Sorry, I could
talk and talk, because there is for me

Just one topic: the children.
But last August

Fell Judy Johnson in that her son,
one of the kindergarten children,

Redness on his buttocks had
and suffered from nightmares.

She accused the grandson
Virginia McMartin, Raymond Buckey,

Which can be seen here at the Halloween Festival
kindergarten.

Raymond Buckey.
On... all concerned parents

to consult  their children,
whether they sexually abused

Forced to oral sex or...
This is absolutely disgusting,

Not you think?
Well, guess

Who have taken them as a defender.
Danny, no! But not these people!

... That is nothing more happened.
But then let the District Attorney

Interview the children again,
namely by the recognized therapist

For child abuse Kee McFarlane.
It comes from CII,

The Children's Institute International.
Using play therapy sessions,

The receive video, they already brought
hundreds of children to

Gruesome examples
to talk about sexual abuse.

I think we should not underestimate,
how scared you can frighten children

Who are helpless. I am now
for 13 years in this business sector

And have never experienced anything like it.
It's just horrible!

Educators have mutilated
animals before their eyes.

Oh God! The poor baby.
... Their parents inflict the same.

No wonder they tell you anything!
Danny, no later than tomorrow morning

Is everywhere topic no. 1!
I hope so. What an event!

You are not afraid that their parents are killed
. There are indeed the Dolls

Everything betrayed and not them.
We examine the case for weeks,

But I always get goose bumps.
Did you think at times of the parents?

How guilty and how deceived
that must feel. Oh God,

They have entrusted their children
these people.

Because you want to be like prosecutor.
To the dismay of many parents

Located but Ray Buckey
still at large.

The Grand Jury today...

I congratulate again,

My first innocent client.

For from it was never an arrest.

Is this the rack "child molester"?
The glasses you put not only on

Or it will be a very short process.
The case takes on incredible forms.

Not only Ray Buckey in prison,
now also arrested his mother.

The 57-year-old Miss Peggy,

Hi, I'm Danny Davis,

I am your lawyer
for the bail hearing.

How can the police do such a thing?
Because you are charged with.

The police had to arrest you.
The parents were worried

That their children happens even more.
I got the camera in the face.

Wayne set may not be the kindest,
but mostly he's right.

Children to think of anything.
But no stories about abuse

Proves the research.
Nonsense!

But Los Angeles believes that
-. Look at us!

Let's see because of how child molesters?
Shall I answer it?

I need proof that they lhren possession.
The deposit is 50,000 each dollar.

You want the house and the nursery?
The deposit for your daughter 350,000.

Everything that I have worked?
For Ray million.

In our neighborhood it is considered holy.
Jeanne d'Arc also was in their neighborhood

Holy and was still burned.
You Signing now. Here please.

As our lawyer you procure

No physical contact.

Thank you.
To the wheelchair I care.

Until then.

You know, what are people afraid of?
Child abuse is against violence.

Surprise you perhaps?
I've been looking for everywhere.

Could we reduce the deposit for the
McMartins? You know...

My clients are not dangerous
to the public, so...

Only that justifies a high bail,
you know that. Come on, Stevens,

Have not even parked illegally.
These people are monsters, Mr. Davis.

Think,
that children would invent something really?

I knew that someone like you
accepts this case. What's happening?

Are you considered the drug dealer?
Remember one thing: I hang more

In this case, than you can imagine.
Fish somewhere else in troubled waters.

We both have taken this case
for a reason. It's a big case.

The media will pounce on it!
Shall I tell you the truth?

You are an opportunist of the worst kind.
Use Kids in order to bring out.

The deserve better.
And they will get well.

Does the defendant not innocent
until proven otherwise?

Yuppie bitch.

Base. Position.
Car is in position.

This is the unlikely...
horror and disbelief,

These are today in Manhattan Beach
the reactions, as the shocked...

Raymond Buckey should have pulled a gun
to the children afraid...

It is the nightmare of every parent.
Ironically the person

Of entrusting it to her child...
... the possibility that the children

For pornographic films used...
you will recall,

How impotent they were,
as they were abused.

Exclusive Reports finish us
my editorial goes crazy.

How was I?
Fantastic. Better than before.

... The new advertising budgets are set according to the
ratings.

And here comes Virginia McMartin,
2 weeks together

Was released with her granddaughter Peggy Ann Buckey
on bail.

... Against child abuse for voters
the most important decisions...

It's about rape, sodomy, oral copulation
and perversion.

Hi, Denise, how are the kids?
Shame on you, Mr. Davis.

However, you must wait here!
Yes, what next? Where should we go?

Sorry. Hey, here I am.

Sorry,
in just over an hour, we are out of here.

Get out and my brother?
A deposit of one million?

Always one by one.
Please sit down.

Are you okay?

Waiting, we go.

ran  driving, up close.

Yes, it can be real.
I need 5 - 10 minutes.

I have to submit few things. Routine.
Then you can go home, ok?

The match but exactly into the picture.
As one can imagine 'a lot.

Because that old, look, will you?

You collection itself. The department of 100
Supreme Court in California

Shall meet. The Honorable Judge Ronald M. George
chaired.

Miss Ruby!

Your honor, the prosecutor
making the request, the accused

The Feilassung to fail on bail.
What did she say?

The deposit is already set.
There are new facts.

New facts? What are these facts?
The children and their parents

Were threatened by the defendants,
that you would kill her,

If they testify as witnesses in the trial.
Thereby the accused to a

Serious danger to the community.
Where are...

The relevant evidence, Your Honour?
Statements of parents and children,

Present me.
I want to ask these children

To clarify the whole.
You come off.

Continue Miss Ruby.
In kindergarten the McMartins

Been abused clearly and irrefutably
numerous children. Thank you.

Yes, Your Honor. I'd like to start at
Peggy Ann Buckey,

The sister of Ray,
the daughter of Peggy Buckey

And the granddaughter of Virginia McMartin.

This young woman was the
Higgins Scholarship

As the best teacher of the year.
Even just to consider that...

The good old Dave, who did not say,
that she is still a virgin.

... And even murderers.
You will find that the accusation

abusing  Hundreds of children
somehow weighs less than...

The murder of a human?
These are mere allegations!

I read the minutes of the hearing before
the grand jury. And I am of the opinion

That they reflect the enormity
these crimes.

No deposit for Miss Buckey
would be a concession to the media.

I know of no precedent...
I think you're exaggerating a little,

Mr. Davis. If in any case,
in the not facing the death penalty

The bail should be denied,
then in this here.

Yes, Your Honor...
In the interest of safety

I refuse Mr. Buckey bail.
I decide just in case

Babette Spitler, Betty Raidor,

Peggy Ann Buckey and Peggy Buckey.

Your Honor!
Your honor, I plead...

Mom.
... You earnestly to reconsider!

What's happening?
I do not know what happened.

What will happen to my children?
Peggy!

I promise you,
I will fight it.

Mr. Davis.

Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis!

Mr. Davis?
Mr. Davis, what are you running away?

What do you want?
Tell my fans now

That Their clients are innocent.
I refer to the statements

And denominated "not guilty".

Section.
Congratulation. They pinched straight

A tail before 5 million people.
You're an asshole! Thank you! Thank you.

Here with me in the studio is a man
of the main defendants in this...

What do you see? Hot tattoos!
Is the 'n Hells Angel?

George Freeman what Buckey told?
Buckey said he children

Before it has penetrated into it,
has purely lubricated with gel, so...

Unbelievable! Where gets set forth the types?
Da, where he herkriegt everything.

From the prosecution.
... Taught in kindergarten

How to please a man orally.
From the gutter! Scum!

This case is disgusting.
Can you not give it?

I myself have 5 children and...
He said it!

I have never said that! And they taught sexual practices
young children!

You must tell me everything!
You've seen my sister yet!

Who can say something about her?
I need to know everything, because I'll

Not stand before the judgment and wait
that the prosecution will rip you!

Now you're talking!
I said, and I'm serious,

You will not be surprised.
This is not a Brotherhood Up!

Here sit small children on the witness stand
and say they were injured.

That's something you need to be prepared.
Then prepare! Who can so what?

What is this? I can not but put simply
any crap in the world?

Okay. Why a young guy
as working in a kindergarten?

Well, I like children.
Never an answer to this question!

So you say please the court,
why a grown man

Preschoolers teaches?
Because my grandmother.

I thought this would be a good professional.
No. Something better. by Think.

Study went wrong. I needed 's job.
Better. It is very naive,

But it is better. You know,
some of the parents have said

You have not worn underwear.
Is that correct?

I wore shorts under no underwear.
Then let lhren Otto hang out?

That's surf shorts that are very long.
For the beach! Is that a crime?

But that's enough to convict you.
You could sit the 500 years in prison.

Tell me about Their women.
How much women you were in bed?

Round numbers only. 20, 30, 50, never mind.
A.

How mean? A...

What?
A woman.

How old are you? 25 years, right?
And you were with a woman in bed?

A single. Is that a crime?
One is tuned for child abuse

's All a crime.

You are gay, have it like from the back?
No!

In camps we all thought it...
I'm not.

Okay. Here's a little
gift for you, Ray.

My name is Ray Buckey.
I say nothing.

I hear nothing.

So you get the teeth apart,
otherwise see old in court.

Why do we get out of the material
the evidence is not fast together?

We have to hurry more.
I'm with Virginia's diaries

As good as through.
Good, diaries should give what.

What about the videotapes?
Since we are not yet at the point.

Do little hope there are more.
Kee works continuously.

When did we last time ate something?
So, Greek or Chinese?

Yes, good idea. What's with porn photos?

It must nevertheless be that find.
Retrieve a list of all photo labs.

And let the FBI
also check Scandinavian distributors.

Incidentally, the letter from Judy Johnson...
Oh, Judy Johnson! Look, Glenn,

We have hundreds statements of children,
they must all be checked

Namely quickly.
Checks times all pet stores.

You killed all these animals.
Where they have the concern?

We should take care of the letter.
Just to see what kind of a.

After what she writes, she seems...
if puzzled to put it politely.

Surprise you, in all of this,
what she's been through?

Whether the defense has a copy of it?
Why not? Checks the animal laboratories.

Hello! You must be Malcolm.

Mrs. Johnson, I'm Glenn Stevens
by the prosecution.

I you prepare to Their statement.
And want to talk with Malcolm.

He's been through enough already.
Malcolm, you go into the house!

Well, I'm going but...

Need to speak with him. Eventually.
Finally that was lts display

With the started this sad case.
Lhr son is our most important witness.

Mrs. Johnson?

More and more nurseries are
for possible connections...

... That all concerned...

... The police were...

... 1,200 children abused and were replaced with
other children.

Sheriff Block speaks of...
I would now ask you for the thousandth time

To the grand jury protocol
and the police report.

Otherwise we make on our own research!
Not as long as I'm chief of police!

For every minute presents anybody
a new perverse perpetrators.

Good reason. What happend today?
Yes, you hear what happened?

How many proofs exist for this?
Watch any news?

Innocent people could be harmed.

Here she comes!

Misery monster, you!
Bitch!

Croak thou shalt!
You bitch!

The want to kill me.
Try to calm down.

In here you will not do something.
You do not know how it's like here.

One can not imagine that a

From a busy street can be viewed
directly into the window.

Anyone can

You can not see.

Do you think she was?
What do you think?

Well, when I read Peggy their indictment,
they asked me what is a dildo.

The others are the same.
Mother, grandmother, happy Christians.

Maximum time a ticket
for parking tickets. Not more.

And yet are there children who claim they were raped
,

Pornography been forced.
I do not know either.

This should all be here in it happened?
I've already experienced so much,

That me nothing more shocked.

Have what about Virginia?
Heather?

Heather Ross, here it is 26-65.
Virginia sat in her old wheelchair

And clapped to the Nackedei games.

This is very helpful.
Sometimes it takes a while,

But then the truth comes out.

Come on, eyes on! Time to get up!
Let's go! Get up!

Pack your things, we move you.
Where to?

Pace! Come on, over there. The bag.
Take the bag, pack pure things.

Go in there!

Completed.

Mom, Mom!
Is it true, Peggy?

Oh, thank God! Thank god!
It's incredible!

It's so horrible here!
Here next door in the cell, this woman

And she... She screams.
All night long she cries!

I'm so glad to see you.

Finally someone with whom I can talk.
Have you seen Ray?

Is he well? My poor boy.
The wanted tell me anything.

Could he go home? I'm afraid.
I'm so worried about him

And around you. And to all of us.
Take care,

She shuts up.
What do you mean?

Because you will definitely bugged.
Do you think that you would out of kindness

Placed in a cell, out of concern
to LHR both well-being? God!

Then they forced us to undress.
We had to lay on his stomach us.

We were handcuffed.
I had very great anxiety.

We should keep our mouths.
You poked me with her fingers.

And that was very painful.
Where it hurt you?

In my butt.
Other men were still in the process.

What did they do?
You've been watching us.

And pictures.
Then we drove Ray to Carwash

And we had all our stuff
off in the car.

Ray has stayed with us in the car
and then he touched us.

These children are so brave,
because they tell the truth.

The poor little things feel
even guilty for shame

That was done to them by others.
Yours all our love and warmth

So that they can get over this terrible trauma
. Caused by...

Kee McFarlane said that reports agree
agree remarkably.

And that over a period of nearly
10 months, since the very first indication.

What's up? What's so important?
In 2 weeks, the preliminary hearing.

Hey, Malcolm. Where's Judy?
Speak better with Malcolm alone.

Tell him, Malcolm.
He hurt me.

Who hurt you, Malcolm? He poked me -
.

Who pricked?
Daddy poked with a stick...

Rum in my butt.

What is a Stock, Malcolm?

The there's a floor.

Where is this happening?
In the bathtub.

Daddy always bathes me.

Does Mom told you that you shall tell bad things about
Daddy?

No.

Why do not you purely to Mommy, huh?
Take care, kid.

You think that's so wrong?
What should I believe?

Can there be an explanation for this?
I ask you, Jane, you know what.

He wants to divorce her.
That may be. Judy does not work

Has absolutely nothing. They tried to take revenge
to extort some money.

We must still press charges.
Jane, if we do that,

Rips us the defense to pieces.
It was here the first display

Against Ray Buckey. Malcolm was the night before
Judy ads does refunded

With his father.
The will say it had begun.

Well, what you want to do instead?

The father further release to Malcolm?
No, of course not.

So, tell Judy,
that they should prevent

That the father Malcolm sees
until we have investigated the matter. OK?

It was hard to get these tapes.
We need to look at here,

I can not take my office.
So, I urgently need your help.

Make to each child notes.
You write the least to,

What you notice for each child.
The first child is Jonathan Lawson.

Den we can skip. When I started in
kindergarten, he was already gone.

Well, but this band is showing
that he knows you anyway. So

Fresh we LHR memory on,
as they say. In court.

I will now show you dolls,
the look totally laughable from.

Really crazy,
I find, see the out.

Wow, who are really great!
The breasts look like tarts

With a cherry on it, right?
She has a belly button

And pubic hair around the vagina.
Impossible!

And the doll here who has a penis!

And now I want you
Get a photo interests.

The man you know, do not you?
Do you remember him?

Um... yes. I do not know exactly.
He does not know...

He was with you teacher
, when you were in kindergarten.

No. I do not think
I saw him once.

Look at him closely.

No.
He was not at some point there?

No, I was not.
Why do they do that?

Pst, listens.

Perhaps I got him yet seen
once or twice.

The elders must help the younger.
The are not as smart as you.

The young children so
strange things have happened. Do you think

You can tell us something about us?
Nothing happened to me.

What, you is really nothing happened?

Somehow I can not remember
me. I'm not sure.

Well, sometimes it's just hard
talk about such things.

But the dolls can.

Hi, snake! The children have
tells us of horrible games

Where the teachers have touched on comic sites
.

Passierte so whatever our Jonathan?
No, I'm not!

What, Jonathan it's not happening?
No, this is not happening to me.

This is not happening to me.
"This is not happening to me."

Remember then
to the tickle game?

"Tickle game?"

Come on, as bad can
your memory not be.

All your friends say,
that you played it.

What is snake? Is your memory
not as good as your friends?

I remember the tickling game.
Look, you have a good memory.

I thought it's pretty bad.
It is certainly better than you think.

Will not you show us
like tickling game is played?

We crawled around on the floor.
And the teacher had to catch us.

They came very slowly to...

And have tickled us.
Were you here sometimes naked?

You have my shirt pulled
and tickled me on the belly.

That's all what happened.
That's all, what happened?

Yes.
It could save your life.

Okay. Now we must remember
to the Naked Movie Star Game.

"Naked Movie Star Game"?

It was just like a fashion show,
I think. Go By some rooms

And constantly rotate
and turn again?

What do the adults made this?

The adults? Do not know really.
Maybe freetime?

Boy, you're really great!
Who took the photos?

Well, how good is your memory, huh?
Ray, I know exactly.

Ray, I know exactly.

Ray, I know exactly.
Outstanding! Outstanding!

Excellent! Outstanding!

It was creepy. He hid in a
old tunnel in the basement.

Our parents could not see us...
And...

We were all naked and danced
. This dance.

And Ray, who killed the horse.
He hit it.

And then there was dead
-. What he hit it?

With a baseball bat.
He hit it and it just lay there.

Who else here yet?
The Geisen man.

And then Ray drove us all to the airport and we are
losgeflogen.

Airfield? But you did not say,
it was a car wash?

It was an airfield,
but the plane had no windows.

You are free. free on bail.
Lhr father is already waiting in the parking lot.

What, now?
Right now. Let's go.

And the others that are also free?
Ray does not, but it was clear to us.

Your mother has to stay here.
Oh my God!

As I will therefore be alone again.
It'll be fine, Mom.

You come also free.
I'll let the comb there.

Perhaps you need him still.

It'll be fine. Be strong.
I love you.

I do not think that I
inside by standing the here alone.

What?
I just do not know

If I do not lose courage.

Okay. Good.
Ok, I'll stay here with you.

I'm not going. I let the security
not store for me and then...

There will arise.
I can try, ok?

No. We are talking nonsense.

Come on, hurry up, before they
think differently. Go on!

Mom!
Go! Go on.

Please!

Parole on bail.

Forgive. I thought you said:
"Thank you for letting me

have brought out here "
but since I am probably interrogated.

I can not.
I feel too guilty.

Guilty why?
That I the others leave behind here.

Today, only a few weeks after the
District Attorney Ira Reiner...

Meanwhile passed 11 months...
Today the first child is a witness

Testify in court. A 7-year-old, the
to his true identity...

It is expected that the statement
this boys Defense

will inflict substantial damage .
The mood here at the courthouse

There is great tension.
This unusual case...

Hey, there they are!
That was expectable.

Please, the light does your eyes hurt!
You have cataracts.

Hey, what is this? Stop!
Have not you heard?

Hey, get rid of it!
You stupid bastard!

No one wants
that you defend the devil!

Her silk satisfied?

Be brave, my little one.

The press sitting in another room,
while the kids make their statements.

The media will have to pursue the negotiation
via monitors.

Hi, Sean.

How old are you?
7

You know the difference between
the truth and a lie?

Yes.
What's happening when you're lying?

I get in trouble.
I agree. When you were in kindergarten

You have there ever played any
Nackedei games?

Cowboys and Indians.
Our teachers were the Cowboys

And we Indians the. They caught us
and have locked us in jail.

Then they touched us.
Where did they touch you?

On my penis.
Who touched you there?

Ray and Miss Piggy.

Do you remember other
Nackedei games?

The Crocodile game.
You call us the names of the people

Who played this game with you?
I can not remember anymore.

Now then, what other games did you play
, Sean?

Naked Movie Star?
Correct. Does anyone photographed

During this game?
I do not know anymore.

Did not you say that Miss Virginia
during Naked Movie Star Game

Photographed?
Your honor. Leading question.

Opposition.
Opposition rejected.

Sean, Miss Virginia taken photos

While her "Naked Movie Star" spieltet?
Yes.

Does Ray you, except with his hand,
with what touches others?

With his penis.
Where did you Ray

With his penis touched?
In my penis.

He said: "In my penis"?
Yes.

Thank you.

Good morning, Sean.
Good Morning.

Morning, Snoopy.

I heard your daddy calls you
Wuschelkopf why is that?

I do not know yet.
Maybe because your hair

Forward a bit protruding?
Yes.

Your mom took you to the institute.
Because you have a wife to know,

The Kee's. And did you
shown a couple of peculiar dolls.

Yes.
And this woman, Kee,

Wanted to talk to you about penises.
Was that so?

Yes.
Did you find it not funny,

That she has talked about the same as what?
Already somehow.

Is also funny. She said she believes
Ray would you touched on your penis

Is not it?
Yes.

And you said no, right?
Yes.

And they gave you repeatedly
asked the same question, right?

Yes.
And at some point you said:

"Well, Ray has touched my penis".
Objection! Leading question.

Sustained.

In your first week you
no longer knew if anyone has photos.

True?
Yes.

But then helped Mr. Stevens you, remind you to
that she photographed.

Yes!
And that's why you said:

"Yes, Virginia took pictures."
Yes.

You knew he wanted to hear?
Yes.

Otherwise he would have been sad?
Yes!

And what you tell,
is also what Kee wants.

Yes.
The also want anyone else to hear

Speaking with you about this case?
Yes.

Thank you Sean, thank you. And thank you, Snoopy.

The court
retracts for 15 minutes.

Helps us continue in any case.
A second round, ok?

Only when Snoopy also wants.
You'll see Snoopy wants.

Did you anyone advised
what to say in court?

No.
Has as Mr. Davis wondered

If you tell what everyone wants to hear from you
because you said yes.

Why did you say yes?
Because I should tell the truth,

And also because I wanted to please him
it.

Thank you.
The witness may be removed.

The hearing was postponed.

Have we done it?
Great! In order to really be glad:

In the break a father told the press,
he had found porn photos of children.

Oh no!
Only he can not submit them because...

Because 4 Cops from Manhattan Beach area
members of Sexrings would.

What? What?
I do not know more.

You said before an audience of millions,
Jim was a member of an Sexring.

Repeat before him!

Okay. They have argued
you had pornographic photos.

Either you give me or I take
you so long in custody until you do so.

But there are no Pornofotos.
What the heck, I ask you!

Jims blood pressure is so high enough
without lts fabrications!

Why did you do that?
We need the attention

The whole country.
After all, our children are at risk!

Do not know the phrase:
"The end justifies the means"?

Pull the bed from, examine the pillow.
Pull everything off and accurate to size!

Ok.

Do not take anything.
The Teddy my mother made for me.

You crocheting something for me.

Pull off. Everything!
Hurry, Hurry!

Well, it will soon.

Enter here!

I have to control all the
body orifices.

Ok.

Fold the ears forward.

Shake the hair.
Abdominal pull up!

Ok. And now prevent.

Pull Their apart labia.
You cough.

You must cough because they like to smuggle things
in her vagina.

Seriously?
Yes. Drugs, guns, do not you think

What reinpasst since. I once had a,
the smuggled 6 packs of cigarettes.

Can I get dressed again now?
What are you doing this evening?

Perhaps I look at the new
Clint Eastwood movie. And you?

Perhaps' ne billiards, as always.
I want to go home, please.

Even before Dad she would show
naked. And you do something to.

Do we have to pick up all this stuff from
kindergarten still?

The sixth time we draw it.

Grandmother?

Grandmother.

How can you still smile?
Are not you bitter?

Of course I am
But despite the bitterness.

Can I gaiety of
young children still enjoy.

Where does Peggy Ann touches you?
On my dick.

Did you Peggy Ann also touch?
Yes. On her bosom.

Did you have to also touch other parts of her body
?

Their cunt.
Does Ray done something to Peggy Ann?

He stuck his cock in her pussy.
Does Ray animals done anything?

He has the rabbit ears cut off!
What did he say when he hare

has cut  ears?
That our parents the same thing happens,

If we betray our secrets.
Took her you still go elsewhere?

At Harry's market.
What happened when you were there?

There they brought us to the camp,
played on tails, photographed.

Her silk yet been somewhere?
In a church.

The Saint Cross Church.
What happened in this church?

You have led us into the aisle and have
animals placed on the altar.

Birds and rabbits and such.
And they have hacked into pieces.

Who is "they", Jonathan?
I saw men in black robes.

With Knitting around the abdomen.
That was really creepy.

They also had time to devil masks.
Devil masks?

Yes, and they have forced us to drink
rabbit blood.

He reports of gruesome animal sacrifices
on the altar of a church.

Did you hear that?
This is a godsend for Davis.

Pagan cult in a church.
Do not get excited, Christine.

White Owen finally our problem?
Glenn, she has promised me.

If she does not, I'm doing it.
The boy reported in the courtroom,

That he drank the blood of a rabbit.
What do you think of Jonathan's statement?

Do you think that in
McMartin kindergarten actually...

Just incredible.
Who else thinks that shit?

I mean something like sacrificed animals
Group, men are running in robes rum.

Soon the children will tell,
they had nailed a guy on the cross

Or 'a virgin on the altar sacrificed.
This is totally out of control.

Do not you also? I have,
which are still completely nuts!

I think we have here nationwide
to do with a conspiracy of people

In their kindergartens already
long time drift terrible things.

Satanism, devil worship!
Widespread all over the country.

All varieties of perversion.
Heard cannibalism for this ritual?

The children have talked about.
And the children were also forced

Eating bloody hearts of children.
Pieces of their flesh.

If the parents is clear
that something really happened

And that the like has not only
happened in the Dark Ages

It more difficult for these criminals,
to practice such rites.

Let us hear of ritual sacrifice,
then we do not want to admit it.

It is beyond the imagination of ordinary people every
.

But that does not mean that the children
not tell the truth.

Where's your storage space?
I show you, come.

That's it?
Yes.

But you can see directly purely!
My cashier sitting over there.

It all looks from his office.
And that has always been so?

Has always!
Could this really be happening?

No, the doors are always locked.
It is some time ago

Night been burgled in the office and the police
guarantees monitoring

Only closed doors.
Could but someone break?

No, accountant, secretary and cleaner
daytime here.

You have to answer questions!
Let us through, please!

Can you really still see parents
in the eye?

How much money you have earned it?
Do not do so hypocritical!

Please, see here!
How long are you doing that?

Keep it out to ride in an elevator
with us, Mr. sentence?

We could suddenly drinking rabbit blood!
Miss Buckey,

I do not make the news,
I give it only further.

No one can describe Their version of the case
, as long as you do not say

What you feel, because you are innocent.
You are not interested yet!

But that Ray is just like an animal.
Sorry, no comment.

Virginia McMartin groped from the children
from her wheelchair. Peggy Ann Buckey

Forced children to have sexual intercourse.
You but the truth is no matter!

What was that? Do that again!
Why not? In kindergarten is purely

Nothing happens, you know
and he knows exactly!

One needs which tell the truth!
Their witnesses like very much.

One assumes the statement back, says
he invented, so you can look forward.

The other says he was in the
Saint-Cross Church,

As a rabbit was slaughtered
and he had to drink the blood.

Question: Do you want lhren case win
or in the Saturday Night Live Show?

How to make the call as witnesses?
I answer for Glenn:

These are our best witnesses.
What about the video tapes?

Forget it.
What does that mean?

The testimony of children has no value.
Kee and Sandy pray to you all.

Tell the children, it was not so,
they say: "But tell everyone else,

that it was so, so you're wrong."
When then say it was so,

Then they are really great!
If the children say of itself:

"Hey, I was abused"?
After their families were threatened?

I have a stupid question.
Why I hear this for the first time?

Did not you already seen by
long ago the tapes?

Yes, of course we have the
But when we brought charges.

We barely had time for that quantity.
We drew upon Kees records.

Are Unreliable?
No, they are not.

What exactly do we have in hand?
We have a confession.

Freeman, the guy who sat with Buckey
in a cell. Believe him?

No one will witness, which I do not think so!
The jury trust a spy.

You may not trust him,
but be convinced,

If only subliminally.
Is there medical reports

That children have been abused?
We could outside CII

Find no one who has confirmed that,
anyone of reputation. All say

The evidence was inconclusive.
I want to hear recommendations.

Stevens?
Well, there are many problems

With this case, but other things
we must also take into account yet.

I think of the media.
I Got doubts among women.

I suggest
that we drop the charges.

Seriously? The desecrated children!
And Buckey,

We reach a conviction with him?
Maybe.

Perhaps?
Four children say

He had abused them at a time,
when he was not in kindergarten.

The children are constantly changing their statements.
The teachers they had taken

The car wash, in mortuaries, cemeteries
to them

Would flew to Palm Springs.
There is no single piece of evidence.

No one has seen them.

Lhr both can think what you want, yes.
As for me, I do not intend,

Also to drop only an accusation.
Not even against the women.

It is our duty to do so.
We are not even sure when Buckey.

That's us. The guy took drugs!
And he flew from almost every school,

Where he was. He sat every day
in this kindergarten with...

Bared genitals before the children.
And there's something else.

What?
The photo. This is a photo of Buckey.

On a pyramid fan meeting.
This woman told our investigators

That she was with him in a motel.
And Buckey has no high got.

What does this have to do with child abuse?
Bring it but in context

With the other events, Christine.
Apparently this is here man,

For no regular sex is possible.
Somehow he had to yes

Satisfaction procure. That fits!
Maybe, but that does not explain anything

In the case of his grandmother, his...
The old woman with the dark glasses?

Do not you know that sexual desires and perversions in women

Just exist like in men?

My predecessor had 208 charges.

Is not that a bit much?

If he wanted to eventually win the election?
OK. So just because we with some

are pieces of evidence have a few problems
people not suddenly

To innocence angels! Children never lie
and never with such a thing.

Somewhere there is a proof,
and is hand-tight! I know that.

We just need to find just him.
One gets drunk, divulges everything.

Someone commits suicide
and leaves a letter of confession.

Someone finally finds Pornofotos!
That's all that's necessary. A photo!

I ask that you listen to me!
What is that, Mrs. McMartin,

Please sit down!
You could know my lawyer,

That his fee is
no longer paid by the public sector.

I have no money. Nothing more.
The kindergarten is destroyed.

Mr. Fountain had with something expected
and received a considerable amount.

He represents you to the hearing at the end!
I never took the life of charity.

I worry for another lawyer.
By I speak not a word!

Mrs. McMartin, do you have any legal knowledge
?

Something much more significant. These children.
They all sat on my lap.

I think you all should first
on child learn as much as I do.

... This hearing comes to an end.
I wont. I stand now on

And will leave this courtroom!
You stay here in the courtroom!

Do you want to use force?
Please set up again.

I'm not going to sit back down.
If you want to use violence, please!

I'll let you equal for contempt of the court
arrest!

Please, Your Honor!
Oh, back to jail!

I know how terrible it is there!
Mom! Are you really going to jail?

You would in there not stand!
You know that! Want to...

Mrs. McMartin!
You're welcome! I know how you feel.

But that's not the right way.
Make the cause for Their Family

Not worse. You're welcome!

Grandmother!

Please sit down again.

Yes.
Malcolm Po is red again.

Who is this? Judy?

What happened? Go's Malcolm well?
He's fine,

But the butt of the dog is also red.
And it lacks there also hair.

Judy, does that mean you're talking seriously
from abuse lhres dog?

Yes, I think it was my brother.
He's been following me all the time.

He's going to kill us, I know it!
What on earth are you talking about?

Have you read the letter,
where they wrote down what happened?

Malcolm was injured by a lion.
There lay a baby, his head had been hacked

And his brain burned.
Malcolm had to drink his blood.

Whether the defense has to?
Rubin will have executed sends him.

We are fine out, because I have
not want me to mess with her.

And in the cemetery were forced you to dig
corpses?

Yes.
Gifts you the adult blades?

Yes.
Please, may I come forward, Your Honor?

So. These are pictures of men here
numbered among them, all right?

Clear.
See you you exactly to Aaron.

If you on one of the men realize
were with you at the cemetery

Then you draw with the red pen
a great circle around him.

Ready?
Your honor, I admit protocol

Aaron the city known lawyer
James Hahn and the actor

Chuck Norris circled.
Chuck Norris?

Thank you.

You see ABC Nightline.
From Washington reported Ted Couple.

Live from our editorial in Los Angeles
now reports Daniel Davis,

The defense by Raymond Buckey,
one of the defendants in the McMartin case.

Mr. Davis, I know it's your first duty
, lhrem clients

The best defense to allow.
But it did not just seem

As you would treat the 6- and 7-year
witnesses very gently.

Was a result of the statements of these children my client

Not released on bail.
That's good, is not it?

... So hard to go to court?
Mr. Buckey, who is innocent...

Never mind that no fear?
What?

If you'll just despise
as McMartins, or even more!

Sure makes me afraid.
The case is the sheer lunacy!

The brought the train to full speed.
Now he rushes there, brings them votes

And no one wants to apply the brake.
A train traveling at full speed, what is this?

You can find it probably still exciting?
Do you have reaped little but trouble!

What do you want?
Let ditch the case.

Because so what people want to be a lawyer.
For Justice.

Oh, please! Now stop it.
This case is as greasy

Like all the others, even worse.
And you know what?

If you actually win this case, all child molesters are
think

They come just unpunished!
You're just like everyone else.

One speaks only the word children from
and everyone already his judgment has precipitated.

Depends on it! On the chair with him!
Where wants to know the whole of America,

That these people are guilty?
What about the goddamn facts?

If you're right, why are you yelling?
Because I do not in the same

grew  ratios like you.
I grew in the slums.

I'm not posh lawyer,
I'm an ass! Yes, true,

I belong to this system, but the
sucks! And everyone should know!

Do you know what is really going on here?
It's called the law.

And that happens to important to me!

Judy!

Get out! You enter consecrated ground.
Judy.

It's me, Steve.
What are you doing with this thing?

Stay away from my children.
Turn from my baby.

Or I'll shoot. I am Jesus Johnson.

You threatened her brother with a gun
because they thought

That he wants to kill their children.
It speaks that the neighbors

Try to abuse their children sexually.
What is wrong with her?

Acute paranoid schizophrenia.
And the drinking makes it worse.

What do you mean by drinking?
It is for years an alcoholic,

Do not know?

We insert a lunch break.
The court reenters together

At 14:30.

See you after the break.
Well, we will every detail

Point by point go.
Come, let's go!

Caution, man!
Goodbye, Mom.

See you tomorrow, dear.
I will be here. I'm here!

Come.
Not to take Forget your medicine.

Come forward!
Peggy!

Mom!
He hurt her.

No, everything ok. She's just stumbled.
I could see it. She is fine!

I do not trust you!
I do not trust any of you.

What I have heard here,
are lies! Lies, from the first day

In this courtroom.
You finally tell me the truth!

I am also not willing to
to take responsibility for it.

Hey, Faye! Let's go eat together?
We go straight to the Greeks

There's fresh fish today.
Yes, well.

Can informally talk to you I times,
does it work?

Member of the prosecutor
blasts McMartin case. It was Stevens.

The only person who so what dares.
It is almost unbelievable.

Wow.
Are you so naive to believe

That a reporter keeps it secret,
that the prosecution

In their own case, doubt?
You've made it even more anonymous.

Many will think that I was.
My career has done so.

How could you do that, Glenn. How so?
Because I think they are innocent.

Do not you? Tell me, Christine.
You can not be indifferent.

Where is the justice?
Wait a minute, where did you suddenly

This oh so sanctimonious tone, friend?
You do not know whether they are innocent.

You are prosecutor. About guilt or innocence
decide the jury.

How to detonate a bomb,
unethical and is cowardly. Begreif that!

If you procured the satisfaction:
I think you've got this case

Irreparable harm inflicted.
And if you procured the satisfaction:

I have destroyed my career,
just to achieve that.

You get my denunciation
on your table. Tomorrow morning.

Mr. Reiner! Mr. Reiner!

How long do you know that?

I consulted in depth
with my staff.

We are all reached the same decision
. The evidence

Present against 5 of the defendants,
are so incredibly weak

To nothing
pose as mere accusations.

We drop the charges against the accused
5 in McMartin case.

Finally.
But we have unique

And convincing evidence, that
Ray Buckey had abused children.

Equally clear and convincing evidence exists
for

That his mother Peggy Buckey
was also involved.

Well, 5 he runs. That's what.
How so? He stands up as the winner.

He knows that he does not get a conviction for all
seven.

That Ray and Peggy all the time
in prison. Without deposit.

He needs an alibi.

Violently reactions sparked today
decision of the prosecutor...

Ira Reiner should go to the 300 victims
and explain to them why the are free

Have done them!
I myself would never me a

Connect  vigilantes, but I would like
not be in the shoes of these people!

Where Wayne is it set?
This really is' a good question.

Browsing.

Thank you. Hello!
A long distance call for Wayne set.

One moment please. Treasure!
A long distance call for you.

Who is this? That you, Kee?
Whose turn is it?

Who is speaking, please?
It's Chris Woodyard from Examiner.

Did you necessarily drangehen?
Hello!

Chris!
Wayne.

He knows. Da's Wayne set.

Hi. What's up?
A little help firsthand?

What do you mean?
The Doll Lady.

How long you live because together already?
If you fuck his informant,

Creates a conflict of interest.
Why the many exclusive interviews.

I am proud of my reports
to this case. For this I am publicly

been awarded. Could it be that something
envy in play here?

You're a piece of shit! Reporters like you
are the reason why you hate us.

We are you ass off...
Try it! But be careful with

What you rauslรยคsst. I am not only
reporter, I am also a lawyer.

There are certain laws. In TV you can
not just say what you want!

The will make a fair interview.
Tell simple as it is.

Then nothing can go wrong.
Why do we organize this?

You look good.
She looks good, huh?

You look really good.
Oh, you look great!

Look at "60 minutes".
In the time when I was in prison,

Since they deprived me arbitrarily
custody of my children.

They were also taken out of school,
they have visited so far.

You were sent to the home.

I also do not know why.
When that happened, he was 8 years old.

Just like any other I have
lost all material possessions,

I have ever had. It has deprived me
my degree as a teacher.

But I studied 6 years.
If you are charged in this country

You are guilty. God help the,
who must prove his innocence.

We were treated just as guilty.
You know who would see it?

Ira Reiner takes a look at the.
Bring the front of the camera.

Virginia McMartin, Betty Raidor,
Mary Ann Jackson,

Peggy Ann Buckey. Their houses,
their wealth, their reputation,

Everything they've lost. Are they right?
No, of course not.

Who is this man to call,
recover to their assets?

And their lives. To the state?
At lhren predecessor? At the CII?

This is not the kind question,
that should be discussed here.

You hope Peggy comes out on bail?
She's 62, was 11/2 years in prison

Before it was brought to justice.
The trial is at least

take  11/2 years. The need to do something, otherwise it would
a scandal.

Is that all?
That's all.

All right, I'll see what I can do
.

Previously you were always so happy here.
Earlier. Peggy Ann, no,

I want to go home again.
No, Mom! Not again

Back in this tiny apartment.
Not yet. You're welcome.

You were not one more time outdoors,
wast dismissed since you. You're welcome.

Here you nothing happens, you know
but as well as I, ok?

Come now! We only make a
very short walk, yes?

You need have no fear.
We are all alone here.

I know that. I know.

I know that I need to have
not afraid, but I'm afraid.

I'm so scared.

Afraid that they come out at night
and drag me back to prison.

I know I've done wrong nothing.
Why happens to me all this?

It seems as if God punish me
for anything.

I could but only teach children.
And I probably should never again.

I really lost everything!

What about you? Your youth!

You do not laugh more
and you have so much laughed. And Ray!

Ray. He's still in there.
How is the boy the only endure?

Oh yes, he will endure.
Do you have it but also managed.

We hold all through.

Come on.

Danny, wait! I've got what.
You have to watch!

See here.
1962, a decision

The Court of Appeal, I think.
Here, I've been tonight.

Who is that? Stevens?

Oh, shit!
Mr. Davis, I can help you?

The Truth About Judy Johnson.
The process never happened,

If that would have been presented to the court.
Cursed, he would never have occurred!

They knew that Judy is mistaken!
Their main applicant, you knew exactly

Woman is paranoid!
Listen to cry on, man!

What do you think who you are?
Why you have withheld from me this?

Who do you think is here in front of you?
Do you expect I'll make

That you get every piece of evidence?
It's not my job to make sure.

They received a summary.
You should have to ask!

You stand with your back to the wall,
you know. You have against the man

Judy Johnson no charges levied!
It shows him for child abuse!

Is it for you no problem,
that I only now know that?

It's not my problem!
Yes it is!

I do not know why you did not get the letter
, but Judy Johnson

Has her husband only accused
when she was mentally unstable!

After her son happened to terrible.
By lhren clients!

Who are you? How do you just come?
Have you read that here?

This? You have not accused
against Judy Johnson's man

Because you wanted to endanger not lts witchhunt
to my clients!

How do you want, all right.
Do you know what I'm going to do now?

I'm going to judge.
And ask him, you and the entire

District prosecutor accusing her
ethical misconduct.

I rarely saw anything so Explosives
as this handwritten letter

Judy Johnson, who was allegedly not fed
Defense.

The prosecution contends
that they only a typewritten

could pass  Summary to you
because of the large amount of evidence.

I accept that as an excuse
and shall therefore the action

Reject because ethical misconduct.
On the other hand, the Court approved

The request of the defense
on interviewing Mrs. Johnson.

It is a very important witness.
I urge you to withdraw.

The physician is notified.
Roger. We are on site. Over.

Every day she heard Mr. Davis made her
ridiculous in the News

And discriminated. I hope
defending regrets the comments.

Where is the dignity of the prosecutor?
The body is not even cold yet!

Read every day that this case
was applied by a madman.

Judy Johnson...

It is truly praiseworthy,
that the prosecution

Such compassion has for Mrs. Johnson,
now that she is dead.

She knew she was mentally ill,
but they did not recommend medical help,

Because they feared that the defense...
The hunting of defense

Has suffered this woman in a few weeks
more than many of us

In their entire lives. I tell you,
that it us only because of the grace of God

Not feel the same.
Police believe that the death

Judy Johnson is the result of a
extraordinary amount of alcohol.

Mrs. Johnson has held an important role in the McMartin case
.

It was their display,
which led to the first indictment,

Levied against Raymond Buckey.
Tada!

A gift for an athlete!
Give them as many kilometers

You can tear down it.
Judy Johnson is dead

I know Ray, and that is terrible.
We do not need them. Thank you guys!

She was everything we had!
I can not stand this anymore!

But, keep your from!
Every night I lie in my bed

And have only one thought:
Why not 'ne plastic rรยผberziehen

Or cut my wrists?
Or 'n dipper ram in my ear!

Why do I have to endure anything further?
To experience how these children my

Pull  skin? As we are humiliated
and lose everything we ever had?

The hate me! I am a figment
hell, worse than a murderer!

The hunt small children before bedtime
with me fear a!

That's right. I'd never lie.
The you really hate.

But we ensure that they hate someone
other, the jury.

Who?
Lael Rubin. What do you think

How they will be lhren case?
You will claim as a photo

Had a porn magazine,
You are a child molester.

You're a sex fiend, because you sometimes wear
no underpants.

Because you are not behind every woman here,
it serves as proof that you on

5-year-old stand. What will happen
when presented this case?

Everyone sees the emperor's new clothes.
All are their insinuations

And all that shit look through.
Do you understand? And they will say:

"Here, when a heard in court,
because he put someone up cross

then this should not be Ray Buckey".
OK?

So, I want you lhren swinging ass
daily on this wheel.

Or you can Lael Rubin
and Kee McFarlane equal

Let dance on lhrem grave.
Tata!

Lot, my son!

Almost four years have passed since the first arrest in
infamous

McMartin case passed. Raymond Buckey
and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey-,

The process is finally made.
8 men and 4 women make up the jury.

Mr. Freeman, Raymond Buckey told you,
that he has had sex with children?

He said he has had sex with children.
Repeat the words

That he used it.
You really want to?

Well, he said he has a 2-year-old boy
fucked in the ass.

So what I would never say.
I know.

Did he tell you what he used,
as he gave the 2-year-old boy

"Fucked in the ass"?
He used baby oil or gel.

Did he say, if anything had happened,
when the baby oil or gel

Has not been used?
Yes. He said that if he uses none,

Then the boy was bleeding.
Ah! We have a little problem.

What one, Your Honor?
I think Mr. Freeman should

take  a lawyer. He told me
that he has done several times perjury

In other cases.
When he told you that?

3 weeks ago.
You knew before Freemans testimony

That he has done several times perjury
and share it not with the court?

I have the circumstance considered until now.
We must give him immunity

Or drop the case.
You can not let that happen.

Do you know what already tasted the case?
I do not care,

Which is a procedural violation! Scandalous!
You might not, but me.

And the citizens of Los Angeles as well.
Your Honor...

I decide, Mr. Freeman says.
So I grant him immunity.

Miss Rubin planned to the way from the beginning.
I've made my decision.

What did you say when Freeman thus
came to you? Do not worry, George.

Kipp from the garbage, you nothing happens.
I said nothing of the sort.

And do not go so
to the public. You're welcome!

The court order says to Mr. Freeman:
bar perjury, you nothing happens.

But for one thing you can give him no
immunity, namely murder.

George Freeman has committed murder?
Why he has not been charged?

It has promised him impunity,
for his testimony against Buckey?

No. I will say nothing.
Pull Their own conclusions.

For the prosecution Freeman
is the Whopper de Luxe with extra sauce.

Either you eat the or you have a sensitive stomach
and leaves him lying.

No matter still during this negotiation
I debunk George Freeman as murderers.

You have nothing in your hand, right?
Nothing.

The main witness in child molesters process
George Freeman,

Morning was arrested,
when he failed to appear in court.

Deputies have sought him out in his sister's house
.

There he wanted to go into hiding. They found him hiding behind some crates
,

In the garage. He surrendered to the police to make
no resistance

And will appear in court tomorrow.
You are mad at me, right?

You know that.
Were you worried that I said,

I would unmask a murderer?
Try it.

Have you ever been convicted of anything,
what could be called child abuse?

Yes.
Is it true,

You time your mother and sister Their
tied, looted their house

And which left both without scruples?
Knows that God alone.

Right. Mr. Freeman,
You are lhrer own opinion

A credible man?
No.

Well, that's all. Thank you.

Have reported in an interview with Mr. sentence
that 60 children Raymond Buckey

have accused  abuse,
before the case came before the grand jury?

I think that's right.
You have not feared

You could hinder the investigation?
Yes, I was very worried so

I would Mr. sentence said the same.
So worried that you attracted to him!

Objection, Your Honor.
Miss McFarlane intimate relationships

Have nothing to do with the case.
Sustained.

Keep up to judge
qualified for whether a child

Was abused or not?
Opposition. Miss McFarlane is here

Not in court.
Even if Mr. Davis wanted to.

Has Miss Ruby fear? Miss McFarlane
of public prosecution

Praised as their experts.
Are you afraid that they meet the requirements

No longer could meet?
Opposition rejected.

Thank you, Your Honor. Please answer.
Keep qualified for?

I've been working in this field,
I consider myself quite qualified for.

What training you have the psychotherapeutic treatment for
?

A diploma as a social worker.
Contained LHR study also lectures

About child abuse?
Yes.

How were the fundraising?
Well, it was a free trial program.

With psychology, sociology. And this
basic courses were aimed at children.

Have you ever children
treated in the psychiatric sense?

I do not understand what you mean.
You know what is psychiatry?

Psychiatry...
Objection! He should not mock.

If you do not know what is psychiatry,
and she pretended to be an expert,

Then the court should know that.
Opposition rejected.

Thank you, Your Honor. Please answer my question
. Have you ever children

Treated in the psychiatric sense?
No.

How have they treated?
As a social worker, clearly.

You have worked in Maryland, New Jersey and California
?

Yes.
You were allowed in New Jersey?

No.
In California or Maryland?

No.
You are not authorized in any state

As a therapist or social worker?
That is correct.

Where did you learn these techniques,
you have applied to the children?

Working with families and attending many meetings
on child abuse.

I do not know any library that contains at this topic
so many books like mine.

I ask to step forward to be allowed to.
We would like to present some evidence.

CCFL.
CCFL?

Your Honor? Thank you.

You have used those dolls?
Yes.

Why?
To the kids in their body parts

to make  familiar.
So they can talk about it.

It's hard for them to name them.
Some of them can not express

What happened to them.
How did you know

That them what happened?
I found that out.

They saw the children only a few minutes
and you pulled the doll out.

How could you know that?
Because of their behavior and...

Because they did not want to talk about it.
Perhaps because nothing happened to them?

It was them something done, Mr. Davis!
Presented Show with puppets teacher?

Yes.
To Raymond Buckey represent

Do not chose a true black doll,
, Miss McFarlane.

The children they have chosen.
Your Honor, I would like cutouts

A videotape that Miss McFarlane
has recorded from Children

submit  as evidence.
Good.

Thank you.

In their dress they pussies.
And what have the little guys down there?

Guess.
A real small penis!

What do you think,
what would be a good doll for Ray?

I do not know.
Well, how about...

Of here? Yes?

What I like are the pubic hair,
although they do not look like real.

You are curled.
Do you see?

He has a hair on his long, powerful
, ugly penis!

You wanted to teach them racism?
I associate dark skin

Not necessarily racism.
You wanted it so do not suggest

Ray Buckey would be a bad person?
With a black doll I connect

No negative character.
To which aimed lts Note:

"You see, he has a hair
on its long, powerful,

ugly penis"?

I have said in all dolls so what.
I show them thus: I am someone

Which they can tell everything.
And who is this?

Miss Peggy.
Miss Peggy!

What do you mean, she does not
funny looking breasts?

You see those here that protrude so?
Have you ever breasts

Seen with such buttons?

A few children from kindergarten
told me that her real name

Miss Piggy is because it is so thick.
Is that correct?

Why do you say Miss Piggy
instead Miss Peggy? What do you mean,

If you talk about breasts with buttons?
You do not understand

How scared these children were!
I fought her inhibitions.

Distinguish Teachers,
was extremely important!

Well, little monkey. Will you behave now
stupid or smart?

So you can help us.
Some people believe namely,

That you're stupid, little monkey!
No, I'm clever!

Certainly?
Hm

Okay.
The little monkey is a coward!

He does not remember any of the
Nackedei games. But we,

We know a game, which is followed
the little monkey will remember.

It is the Naked Movie Star Game.
Is it hard for you again

Or is your memory that bad?
You said to Sam, he was stupid.

The fact that he was a coward and that he had
a lousy memory, right?

I told the doll.
You do not think that Sam believed

You would call him stupid?
If I had feared that,

I never talked so!

So, the other children, who
the Ray doll taken

And did. The!

Want him so beat,
like the other kids?

Come on!

Well done! That's good for you! OK then!

Want to punch him? Only about!
Yes, good!

Why did you instigated it,
the doll that personifies Ray,

Beating? Tempted to believe not
a child, he was a bad person?

Not at all! This is part of the therapy.
It is better to let out anger,

Than to bury them in the subconscious.
Displacement is very dangerous

Comparable to a time bomb,
the incessant ticking.

Their assistant has learned from you?
Yes she has.

but it was originally Posted
to use the video camera.

You acknowledge the correct training
a very high priority!

Miss McFarlane, that is, and I quote,
"One of the worst cases

child abuse
in the history of the world".

Why you did not bring a specialist?
Most lacked the courage to do

What was needed.
Courage, what to do?

Quite simply,
out the truth.

Do you remember how many times you your mom
asked if something happened?

159 times.

Ah! I know what we do now.
I've already

Played with another girl.
Here is the big bird

From Sesame Street. The other little girl
let him squeak.

Once for no and twice for yes.

Can you do that too?
Once for no and twice for yes.

Good.

As you Jenny in kindergarten touched, she was da
begrabscht of one hand?

No.
No.

Does Ray sometimes disgusting things driven
with the kids?

No.
No!

Occasionally take people we
like to have, children sensitive

And particularly ticklish spots on.
Does Ray done in other children?

No. But we want to hear no more no's
!

No, no, no, no!

They told the parents of this girl,
that she had been abused. Correctly?

Yes. And that the child is displaced.
Did the parents all videotapes?

What do you mean, please?
Whether the parents saw all the tapes?

No. We have 400 children interviewed
and every day have reported more.

I konstatiere: So you needed
only to press the button and then

Earnings were very lhrer hand.
Whether it was abused or not?

You overestimate my abilities.
The very idea that a child

After 1 or 2 hours with me says,
it was misused

Makes me almost a genius!
Children...

3-6
can be very easily influenced.

In this age they still believe in fairy tales and miracles
.

It is very easy to intimidate them.

You have said,
not Miss McFarlane?

I knew what would happen if I give this
videos to the public.

That people like you hold me everything.
But someone had to do it, Mr. Davis,

So that children can tell the truth.
The truth?

And only you could find out?
What for amounts that?

That I tried to instil false memories
harmless children?

Do you think I do that out of vanity?
No. I think,

They had for a very noble reason.
They believed namely actually,

That these children were traumatized.
And moreover you wanted them

Further trauma through this process
spare. But I also think

You knew how dangerous this
manner of approach,

Because it is suggestive.
This technique can only be applied,

If the abuse is clearly demonstrated.
Here are such evidence does not exist.

But they turned it on anyway.
And Their results should be evidence.

Ridiculous! There was this abuse.
The children do not lie to me!

I can prove it! Only you and the
whole legal system they want to keep,

Telling the truth.
But you do not see her face.

Because the truth is:
You're not listening to the children.

You closed from the truth,
you you so desperately

Tried to explain.
Instead planted

In the lively imagination of children
at the end of notions of something

That has never taken place.
Why should I do that?

I do not know. I just know you're
Mr. sentence met, right?

And that you were to
Jeanne d'Arc children move suddenly.

For ardent campaigner for the rights of children
to their Savior!

Certainly the temptation was too tempting.
What temptation?

In talk shows to be hosted.
Things were wonderful for you!

Your Honor, objection!
It was fantastic!

It is enough. Objection sustained.
Thank you. No further questions.

Raymond Buckey has now spent five years
in prison without bail

to freely come . This is unique
in California history and has

Performed in jurisdictions to criticism.
But today has Judge Pounders Buckey

The bail granted
and him into the custody of his lawyer

Daniel Davis transferred.
Stay there! Reply!

Let us through.
How's lhrer family?

Come on, Buckey, you know that you are predisposed
pedophile.

You can only children to have sex,
because you can not force anything.

Quit, I can not stand it anymore!
Ok, all right. Chill out.

With such crap you tomorrow bomb
all day long.

Above all, you need to see the jury
eyes. Always look the other way!

You must keep up with any eye contact.
I can not do it.

Why not? What are you afraid of?
I sat 5 years in prison!

I react just not normal.
When I think of this woman,

The lies about me spread
and gets me, as often as they want!

Maybe I start to howl!
And that's exactly

What they want to achieve.
Ok, that's what you're afraid.

Do you want to know what I fear?

I have to be a sleazy shyster afraid
.

In order to live,
I represent drug dealer and scum.

I'm afraid that Rubin, Ira Reiner
and all the public prosecutor

Eat me alive. But I
something that did not, Ray.

And you are. And the only
what you have, that's me.

I go tomorrow in this courtroom,
swallow my fear down and fight.

And tell them something,
what in this process until now

Would not listen, Ray. The truth.
And the jury will believe us

Or not, my friend.
If they believe us, Ray,

You'll be a free man.
And if not...

Yes.
You understand.

Yes, I understand.
You hear all these kids

You accuse, they abused to have
to killing animals

And have threatened them, their parents
kill if they reveal anything.

Have lied all these children?
No not all.

What do you mean by "not all"?
I think some were enticed

To believe this had happened everything.
To be able to please step forward, Your Honor.

Do you know of these photographs?

What have you got? Are you afraid?
Take them into the hand.

Will you please describe to the jury,
which can be seen on the First.

A man who met a woman orally.
Why you have the picture?

To masturbation.
You have previously masturbated, right?

Tell how you have done that.
What do you mean?

Is it so that you glued the photo to the window
lhres room and on the bed

Masturbated in a position so that you
everyone saw from the road?

No, that's not true.
Two neighbors say the but.

One can not see in my room.
Do you think a person who does,

Should work in a kindergarten?
I think it has nothing to do

With the kindergarten.
Why They tore the picture then,

When the police arrived?
I was afraid of,

What would they make of it.
What do you mean by "make it"?

What you are now trying to make something of it.
Is it so that you in kindergarten

Often rumgelungert the pool?
In wide shorts without underwear,

So Their genitals were exposed?
No, that is not true.

Although I was not wearing underwear,
but the shorts went down to his knees.

So you're just a normal
heterosexual, typical young man.

Is that so, Mr. Buckey?
Who can say of himself?

Is it so that the only satisfaction
you've ever had or will have,

Has occurred with these children?
They are incapable of satisfying sex

To have with an adult woman?

I have never committed a lot of mistakes
, no doubt.

I'm not perfect, but I had
never sexual intercourse with children!

And I've never hurt a child.
And I was very comfortable

Quite outstanding sex
with an adult woman, Miss Ruby!

Are you interested in pyramids?
Objection! Irrelevant.

Rejected.
What are pyramids?

Many believe in their positive effects
on all living things. You sleep better

If รยผberm bed depends, superstition.
Flew to a fan meeting,

Where pyramids were sold?
Opposition. I suggest

That we will discuss with you.
All right.

Your honor, I must protest.
Miss Ruby tries just here

Pyramids to transform into pentagrams.
They called Peggy Buckey a

Caring teacher. What man
allows one who takes drugs

To work in a kindergarten?
Objection overruled. Go on.

to be able to step forward  Please, Your Honor.
Granted.

Displays this photo you at a meeting
and hold a pyramid in hand?

Yes.
Seeing that woman right?

Yes.
Who is Diana Sullivan?

What can I say about them?
We had a relationship.

but  Two investigators she
something tells another.

It's of no consequence, right?
Prosecutors drags them.

And she will tell you that you can not have sex with women
.

That will hurt us, Ray.
This is Diana do.

Ah yes, why not?
Because you suddenly and unexpectedly

Were to a great seducer, Ray?
I know that they will not do that.

Mrs. Sullivan, you have 1984 tells
that you never intercourse

With Buckey had?
Yes.

And to whom?
Several people. my fiance

And investigators
who interviewed me back then.

So why did those words mean?
Because I protect my reputation and...

My wedding did not want to jeopardize.
And were in the final weeks

Again investigators from Miss Rubins office
with you in Montana

And you have visited?
Yes.

What concern they?
Talk to me about my statement.

They interrogated me in front of my children.
The thought I have to go to prison.

What exactly did they want?
Be sure that I assert here

I never slept with Mr. Buckey.
And did you and Mr. Buckey

A sexual relationship?
Yes.

Thank you, that was all.
Mrs. Sullivan,

Change frequently Their Partners?
No, not at all.

And you like the attention,
which brings the process?

No. I know that my children
will also be affected.

You Had
intercourse difficulties with Mr. Buckey?

What do you mean, trouble?
Was it necessary to stimulate him orally,

Because Mr. Buckey was no other way to satisfy
?

No!

Did not you say the investigators?
Nothing like that.

Are you sure?
I never would have so expressed.

What term would you have chosen
Mrs. Sullivan?

I would have said "a blow".

Today Mr. Buckey is the 6th day
on the witness stand. Miss Ruby has the

Probably worst abuser
history caused to admit

That he was not wearing underwear,
that he smoked marijuana,

That he in the power of the pyramids...
today The last sandwich.

Yes? Would you like to have that?
No. Actually yet.

... 400 times child abuse goes
and a nationwide hysteria unleashed.

Have found these items in
lhrem room?

Yes.
You have early

Pornography interested. How old
were you when you recorded the image?

I was approximately 11 years old.
It is very perfect for this age!

I always got myself Playboy Magazine

You have since drawn pubic hair,
see?

And nipples. Here you can see?

Coming back to the pyramids. Are
the Their books?

Yes.
Find it normal,

In lhrem age to believe in pyramids?
Well. Furthermore I laugh long.

Today, yes. But then surely not?
No, I... Not before.

See where this so-called Ray-Dom?
Yes, but he's only.

That has nothing to do with me.
I did not ask. Is the action

A beam cathedral or Ray-Doms 40 times
as large as that of a normal pyramid?

Objection, your honor! That
pure speculation about the...

Wattage of a beam cathedral.

It is the lovely piece of you?
No.

Who then?
My sister.

Who bought her?
The father of her boyfriend. A joke.

Are these naked beings you?
No.

Who then?
You are my mother.

It lifts them on for ages.
For their grandchildren.

What does it mean?
This is a pyramid hat.

A pyramid hat.

Is it really?
You... need to turn it.

Mr. Buckey, it is possible
that the power of the pyramids

She seduced the child abuse?
No.

This force has blocked LHR brain
so you forgot horrible things?

How the abuse of children?
No.

That you never ever children
abused, that might be?

Yes.
Watch the jury in the eye

And answer the question:

Have you ever abused a child?

No.

Do you want to train?
The jury has decided.

Have you experienced this now?
I've already experienced at night.

With the reading of the judgment
today begins the negotiation morning.

Rift over 13 points.
Is that good or bad?

Your mother is accused in 13 points.
When there are not agreed to,

Then that is not good for us.
This can also be just a coincidence,

And thus is even
not the end of everything.

I can keep on deposit there.
We will appeal.

We find sufficient reasons.

It sorry, Ray.
I never thought

That 12 people all this crap
would believe.

I just was not good enough, Ray.
No, Danny.

You were the best. You have done what was in
lhrer power.

I have always known,
that this can not end well.

I that my own bag.

You have come to the decision?
We are, Your Honor.

Hand over the officer
the forms

So that the Court may examine them.

The chairman will read the verdict.

In the present case, the state
California against Raymond Buckey

And Peggy McMartin Buckey-we are,
the jury,

The defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey-
and Ray Charles Buckey...

Not guilty of abuse of children under 14 years

And breach of paragraph 288 A
of the Criminal Code.

Oh my God!
Is so LHR judgment?

Yes, Your Honor.
You got to the unanimous verdict?

Yes, Your Honor.
Prefer the prosecution

Question the jury still single?
I want the jury for its employees

Thank in this most important case.
Are you happy, Ray?

Have the verdict expected?
We are very happy.

Ray, what are you doing now?
Do you want to write a book?

Ray, what did you do now?
What will you do as a free man?

What are you doing now?
Thank you. Thank you.

We are very happy.

It is over! Finally it has a...
I've been watching you all the time

And wondered what you might think.
How difficult it all for you

must have been . I could see how
strives They were not to cry,

But sometimes failed you.
The Diary your mother is touching.

The kindergarten was your purpose in life.
I'm not bitter.

I was brought up,
to forgive the people.

We have lost everything.
We have nothing

Nothing saved!
Mama, we have nothing at all!

If Ray because the 13 question
points back to court?

If you do that to the children, the
is the biggest abuse of all time.

The justice has been done.
Today I examine

The McMartin scandal. What went wrong? Will he
a grim era of

trigger  molester movies?
The legal system is perhaps

been done  satisfied,
but justice not.

On, America wax!
And here are some angry,

Utmost applied parents.
We are concerned parents

Across America. The case is
again negotiated, certainly.

The waves beat high,
dissatisfaction is very large.

The diminish in any way the,
which had to go through these children.

What they will remember all their lives
.

The prosecution decided
again to complain against Ray Buckey.

We want to discuss something with you,
what will please you.

Where's Ruby?
You no longer processed in this case.

You wanted to Santa Monica.
Because the New York Times their behavior

As vile and some...
Let us please come to the point.

We want the state to spare costs.
It has already spent enough money.

I bet that there are the bands.
Finally has a spotted the tapes

Right?
We do not yet talked to Reiner,

We are safe with him...
That's bullshit! Clear?

We would otherwise not be sitting here.
He wants to be attorney general.

If you lose again, you are
Their jobs going. What do you offer me?

I'll tell you what I think the case over
. The best solution

For Reiner,
would be a "nolo contendere".

The my client has to decide.
There is no admission of guilt.

And you can say, sit
not decrease, because the offer is too good.

You are slightly
sentenced for each child. No prison sentence.

That does not mean that I'm guilty?
No. This means that you say

"I take the offer, it's too good,
to it refuse".

Is that all? Then nothing?
You have to report to the police.

Report? How come?
Because you are a sex offender.

Are you trying to take that again?
I will not without due process

can win  why?
We are not yet through a ride.

Forget the dream. I'm done,
I'm done! I'm burned out.

You no longer hold it by also.
They wanted to then hang

Do not talk about a second process.
Ok, I thought about killing myself.

Ok! But never, at no time,
times when it was not really bad...

Listen to me! Not even I
thought for giving that

What they now ask me.
I do not write on a sheet of paper

"I am a pedophile". No way!

It says, "The play is over,
if the diva singing the final aria".

I'm afraid she has already sung.

Thank you. Hey! How's it going, Danny?

What do you expect from the second process?
You have made me an offer.

But I said no.
Hey! Wait it out!

Throw to the camera, quickly!
You know, I promised Martinez,

That nobody learns.
And what now?

Mr. Martinez! Can Ray Buckey
proposed a deal?

No. Not even in a dream! We would
Ray Buckey never make an offer,

Even if he dreams of. Good day.
Do's.

He lies off the ass!
What?

I said, "He's lying his ass off!"
Come on, guys! Admission.

Martinez is a liar. I met with him and cut
with the conversation.

If you want, you can hear it.
I'll tell you how I

The case think: The best solution,
for Reiner is a nolo contendere.

Thank you.
Thanks, Danny.

You were right. The Diva has still far sung
final aria.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury!
Are you reached a verdict?

We arrived in any of the charges
to a unanimous decision.

Because disagree, we are also not unanimous

Decision achieve more.

The McMartin case is closed.
He took 7 years

Cost 15 million dollars
and there was not a single conviction.

Is funny.
7 years and in a minute...

Is final. That's so crazy.
No.

It's not the end,
not for me.

If one happens to something,
then begins not simply

On with his life from the beginning.
Not at my age.

The time gives back no.
We do not want to offend, Danny.

We are very grateful.
But...

This thing will attach us forever.
People have a short memory.

A scandal in the newspaper, 'ne Sensation
on television, people forget quickly.

There are the abusers.
Child molester!

What do you want, huh?
Tell me that even in the face?

Molester. Can you see it?

The People will not forget that.
And they do not care,

That they have ruined our lives.
And not only ours.

Also the parents. And the children!

Why did God not prevent this?
Oh, no, give God not blame.

What happened to us,
was only the work of men.

God could not intervene.
Who developed already the time

listening  on what he says?
They were all busy

Watch television.
