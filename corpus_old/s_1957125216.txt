â™ª

â€ Well, I guess it is about kickâ€off time.

I'm gonna put this on top of here

so we can get both of us.

My next guest has appeared on Broadway.

Sold out Carnegie Hall.

She's played in movies
out in Hollywood

with the likes of Louis Armstrong.

I am Reginald Lord Divine

and oh, my God...

Oh, my God.

I cannot believe
that we have the opportunity

as I live and breathe
to interview the Lady,

the legend, my hero, Miss Billie Holiday.

The Lady Day.
Which do you prefer, honey?

â€ She'd prefer you pay her money first.

REGINALD:
Tell me. Tell me.

What's it like to be a colored woman?

â€ Would you ask Doris Day
a question like that?

â€ Well, Doris Day
is not colored, silly. [laughs]

â€ Jesus.



â€ I want to talk <i>Strange Fruit.</i>

Yes, <i>Strange Fruit.</i>

My audience wants to know.

You keep getting in trouble for it,

but you are determined to keep singing it.
Troublemaker!

â€ You ever seen a lynching?

It's about human rights.

Government forgets that sometimes.

â™ª "All of Me" playing â™ª

They just want me to shut up
and sing <i>All of Me.</i>

REGINALD: <i>Let's start where it all began.</i>

<i>At the Cafe Society.</i>

<i>Oh, honey, I loved that place.</i>

â€ â™ª <i>Can't you see?</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I'm no good without you</i> â™ª

REGINALD: <i>I remember seeing</i>
<i>Lena Horne tipping in with... Who was it?</i>

<i>Oh, that drunk. Oh! Tallulah Bankhead.</i>

<i>â€</i> â™ª <i>I want to lose them</i> â™ª

REGINALD: <i>That's the first time</i>
<i>I saw you sing, honey.</i>

<i>Mesmerizing. Oh, and everybody was there.</i>
<i>â€ â™ª I never use them â™ª</i>

REGINALD: <i>The wrong kind of place</i>
<i>for the right kind of people.</i>

FREDDY: <i>Like Jimmy Fletcher.</i>

BILLIE: <i>Leave him alone.</i>
<i>He didn't know what he was walking into.</i>

FREDDY: <i>Yes, he did. Soldier boy.</i>

<i>â€</i> â™ª <i>How can I go on, dear</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Without you?</i> â™ª

REGINALD: <i>You were there with</i>
<i>that famous manager back then</i>.

<i>What was his name?</i>

FREDDY: <i>Crook.</i>

[Billie laughs]

BILLIE: <i>Yeah, that's right.</i>
<i>Crookedâ€ass Joe Glaser.</i>

<i>He was there with my husband Monroe.</i>

â™ª <i>So why not</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Take all of me? â™ª</i>

â€ Have a good evening, sir.
â€ You as well.

<i>â€</i> â™ª <i>Your goodbye</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Left me with eyes that cry</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>How can I</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Go on, dear,</i>
<i>without you? â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>You took the best</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>So why not take the rest?</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Baby</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Take all of me â™ª</i>

<i>[applause]</i>


[indistinct chatter]
[dog barking]

WOMAN: Okay, give me a lighter.

â€ Orson Welles is outside,
he needs to see you again.

â€ Tell him tomorrow. Monroe's out of town.

â€ Mmâ€hmm.

You got some fans in from Baltimore
that want to see you.

â€ Lucio, you dig the show?
LUCIO: Oh, yeah.

MONROE: And who are you?
â€ Jimmy Fletcher.

â€ She don't know you.
Move. Come on, y'all.

â€ Thank you.
ROSLYN: Come on, y'all, meet Lady Day.

â€ Hey, how y'all doing?
Thanks for coming.

MAN: Hello, Miss Holiday.
â€ Oh, no. Please call me Billie.

â€ We love you.
â€ Ah, y'all are sweet.

So y'all came all the way from Baltimore
to come see me, huh?

â€ Yes, ma'am.
â€ Yes, ma'am.

And you're gonna take me
to a fancy dinner, too.

â€ Geeâ€whiz! I'm from Baltimore, too.

Come here. Have some champagne.
Prez, give 'em something to drink.

You just make sure he take you
to Jimmie's Chicken Shack up in Harlem.

ROSLYN: Oh, God, yeah. Mmâ€mmâ€mm.
BILLIE: That's good eatin'.

Here. Let me see that.

MONROE: Where in Baltimore are y'all from?

â€ Near Columbus Park?
â€ Okay, yeah, she's from east.

â€ Yeah. Fells Point.

WOMAN: Thank you.
MAN: Thank you, Miss Holiday.

MONROE: No, nigga.

â€ I'm sorry, Mom.
I was on a job interview.

â€ What job interview's, uh, at 10:30...

Don't... stop. Stop.
[Fletcher grunting]

What job interviews are at 10:30
on a Sunday night?

James, your lies are unbecoming,
and I'm getting tired of it.

Living off your father's
hardâ€earned trust.

And you know I hate when you're late.
â€ Yes.

â€ Sunday dinner's all we have together
now that you've moved out.

â€ Yes. Yes, Mother, I was downtown
interviewing for this writing position

with <i>The Sun</i> news.

I had to go to the editor's home.

I got the job.

[Fletcher groans]

â€ Your father would turn in his grave

with all that he accomplished.
â€ Mom. Mom, please.

â€ You're not fooling nobody
walking around in that uniform.

Just because I don't hang
in the gutter with your friends

doesn't mean I don't know what's going on.

You're hanging out
with those jazz musicians

in them clubs and God...

God knows what else.
Take this out of here.

â€ I do like the jazz clubs, Mom.

I even met Billie Holiday.

â€ Really?
â€ Yes, really.

You should be congratulating me
on my new job that I start tomorrow.

Finally getting out of this uniform.

â€ Oh, my! Billie Holiday!

I hear that she is quite the lady.

â€ I don't know, Mom.
I hear just the opposite.

â€ Those are just rumors.

Anytime somebody colored
is doing something right,

they paint us out wrong.

â™ª

WAITER: Good morning, Miss Holiday.
â€ Milk. No, that's for the baby.

Mommy didn't forget about you.
[indistinct dialogue]

â€ It's like a damn kennel in here.

<i>â€ Vogue</i> magazine want to interview me
about your gowns and such.

â€ You ain't giving no interview
to no magazine.

Somebody wants to hear about her
they can come talk to me.

â€ They sent these over.

â€ I'll take them both.
â€ It'll cost me an arm and a leg.

â€ Shut the fuck up, Monroe.

[Billie laughs]

BILLIE: Send the dressmaker
one of my husband's arms, please.


â€ [whispering]:
Ooh, where'd he come from?

â™ª saxophone playing â™ª

â€ Yeah. Joe, nah, he not clicking.

â€ Hey, man. Thanks for coming in.

â€ Sorry, ma'am.
â€ Thank you.

â€ Good riddance.
â€ Ros.

â€ He was horrible.
â€ Take a look.

â€ Yeah, looks good.

MONROE: They should be running
halfâ€page ads, at least.

You should be getting
a bigger cut of the door, too.

You're practically
topping the DownBeat poll.

Eleanor Roosevelt has to pull strings
to get in here.

â€ He has a point.

â€ Yeah, you do kind of got a point.

Glaser.

â€ I'm working on it.

â€ When she started here, she was a nobody,
and now she's a star.

â€ I'm working on it, okay?

â€ Joe's working on it, honey.
ROSLYN: Give me that.

Mmâ€mm. See, look. Told you.

[dogs chewing noisily]

â€ Your friend Anslinger's
in the paper again.

â€ He ain't no friend of mine.
â€ Sure he is.

Glaser's friend, too, right?

GLASER: I cut <i>Strange Fruit.</i>

â€ No, Joe.
I want to sing the damn song, all right?

The club advertises it.

People pay good money to come here
and hear me sing it.

GLASER: I've told you a hundred times,

people in high places
don't want you singing that song.

â€ And I've asked you
over a hundred times...

"What people, Joe?"

What you looking at him for?

Shit, I'm the one who pays you.

â€ The government.

â€ Yeah, the government.

People like your buddy Anslinger, right?

â€ Quit it with that, huh?

â€ The song means a lot to me, Joe.

â€ Meeropol wrote it
and he's a fucking commie.

â€ Come on. I don't care, all right?

It's important to me.

â€ You ain't singing that song.

â€ I'll sing what the fuck I want.

â€ Look, if Lady wants to sing the song,
then we should sing the song.

â€ Gives a face to them
little boys being lynched.

â€ Mind your business, Freddy.

Look, bitch,
we ain't going through this again.

â€ You, uh, if you all
ain't Anslinger's friends,

then how come you be sitting with him
every night?

â€ What do you expect us to do, huh?

Run from the man?
I'm trying to protect your ass.

â€ Don't lie to me, nigga.

â€ I ain't lying.

â€ I'm scratching it.

It's for your own good, okay?

[dogs barking]

MONROE:
Get up, c'mon.

â€ Get the fuck off me. Come on, let's go.

â€ Fuck the feds and fuck Anslinger.

â™ª

[indistinct chatter]

â™ª

ANSLINGER: Gentlemen.

You have to help me get this budget
pushed through Congress tomorrow.

â€ We just increased your budget last year.

Thank you, Roy.

McCarthy, I gotta get me
a Roy Cohn just like you.

Why is this so important to you, Harry?

â€ Drugs and niggers are a contamination
to our great American civilization.

â€ Well, that's why we helped you
in the first place.

â€ John, listen to me.
This jazz music is the devil's work.

That's why
this Holiday woman's got to be stopped.

She keeps singing this <i>Strange Fruit</i> song

and it's causing a lot of people
to think the wrong things.

We've warned her to stop singing that,
but she won't.

We've got her husband in the bag,
though she won't stop singing the song.

â€ People are calling the song
a musical starting gun

for the soâ€called civil rights movement.

â€ Well, let me ask you a question.

You all got a plan?

We can't just arrest a nigger
for singing a song.


â€ She's inciting a riot.

ROY: That's a misdemeanor at best.

She's a drug addict, though.

â€ Exactly.

â€ You go after that bitch on the drugs.

â™ª

â€ Joe Guy! [laughs]

I came down here for you to save my ass.

JOE: You don't need me to do that.

Shit, Lady...

You do that all by yourself.

[exhales sharply]

[clock ticking]

[horn honking]
[dogs barking]

<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

GLASER:
<i>It's for your own good, okay.</i>

<i>I'm scratching it.</i>

BILLIE: <i>Thank you.</i>
<i>[applause continues]</i>

Can you all hear me out there?

CROWD: Yes!

â€ Oh, good. 'Cause I sure can hear you.


Say hi to Louis Armstrong everybody.

[cheers and applause]

We're recording a Vâ€Disc tonight
for all our men and women in the service,

and that makes tonight
all the more special.

You all are fighting
a real fight out there

and we love you for it.

[cheers and applause]

â™ª mournful music playing â™ª

I feel lonely, Louis.

Let's say we try <i>Solitude.</i>

â€ Anything for you, Lady.

â€ â™ª <i>In my solitude</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>You haunt me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>With reveries</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Of days gone by</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>In my solitude</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>You taunt me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>With memories</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>That never die</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I sit in my chair</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Filled with despair</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>There's no one could be so sad</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>With gloom everywhere</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I sit and I stare</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I know that I'll soon go mad</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>In my solitude</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I'm praying</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Dear Lord above</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Send me back</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª My love â™ª</i>


[spoon clinking]

FLETCHER: Hi.

Is Miss Holiday here?

â€ You finally struck up the nerve
to come see her.

BILLIE: Who is that?

â€ It's the little writer nigga
here to see you.

â€ Freddy! Who is it?

â€ Little pretty motherfucker
that be writing all the time.

â€ Oh! Yeah. Let him back.

â€ You can give me them flowers,
she don't need 'em.

What, you scared?

You better not be one of 'em
gossip folk either.

Lady, I'll be back.
BILLIE: Yeah.

[door closes]
No uniform tonight, soldier boy.

You're here all the time.

Jimmy Fletcher.

â€ Great show last night.

â€ Yeah...

Now it's quiet.

I don't like the quiet.

So noisy, you know.

â™ª

I've been practicing this new thing.

What you think?
â€ I like it.

â€ It's nice, right?
â€ Yeah.

â€ You don't got a girl?
â€ Nope.

I've served my time for the country,
now, starting a new job.

[Billie counting, quietly]

Your boyfriend give you that stuff?

â€ Why, you want some?

â€ No, thanks.

â€ It takes the edge off, you know.

Two, three...

Pour yourself a drink.

...three.

â€ Sure.

â€ One, two, three.

One, two, three.

â€ Why don't you ever sing <i>Strange Fruit?</i>

<i>â€ Strange Fruit.</i>

I got to be pretty high to sing that one.

â€ Never heard you sing it.

â€ It's a song about important things,
you know.

Things that are going on in the country.

I don't think people know
I care about those things.

Most of my other songs
are just about love.

â€ Well, love is important, too, right?

â€ You know, one day,
I'm gonna quit the drinking.

And get off that stuff, too.

[Fletcher chuckles]

Maybe go to one of those hospitals,
you know,

like Judy Garland, those movie stars.

You know how to do the waltz?
That shit is so pretty.

â€ Yes.

â€ You do?

You would look good in a tuxedo.

â€ You are funny.

â€ Yeah.

'Cause I know what you want.

â™ª

[Fletcher chuckles]

Which one of my songs
is your favorite song?

<i>â€ All of Me.</i>

<i>â€</i> â™ª <i>All of me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Why not take all of me</i> â™ª

Yeah.

All right, well,
that'll be our song then.

So you really know
how to do the waltz, huh?
â€ Yes.

â™ª

â™ª


â€ That's good. Come on.

â€ Come now. Come on. Come on.
â€ There you go.

That's good.

FREDDY: I know.
BILLIE: Right.


â€ I'm sorry for your loss.

â€ Of course.
FLETCHER: I lost my father
when I was young.

â€ My Lord...

[sighs, clears throat]

â€ Chiquita sat on my lap every day.

ROSLYN: It was her dog.

Her dog died.

â€ It was the little one, not the big one.

Mister's all right. Yeah?

Mister's fine, right?

ROSLYN: Billie, I told you,

you can't let Chiquita
eat off your plate.

That's why she choked.
â€ Ros.


REGINALD:
Someone tells me

you are very tight

with Tallulah Bankhead.

You know what I mean?

â€ Now wait. What Tallulah Bankhead
got to do with this?

You said this interview
was a retrospective on her career.

Cut the tape.

Cut the tape.

Little bitch, you got one more time
to ask one more smartass question.

â™ª

â€ Nobody saw us come in here, right?
â€ No.

<i>Vogue</i> magazine wants to talk to me
about you.

Should I do it?
â€ Go ahead.

Just take me to your room.

â€ James.
â€ Ma'am.

You know I can't allow her on here.


â€ James, don't you know who this is?

â€ I do know who
she is, Miss Bankhead.

Also know I want to keep my job.

Miss Holiday, only Negro allowed
on this elevator's me.

â€ What? So Negroes can't,

but a bunch of goddamn bull daggers can.

â€ Miss Holiday, you got to
take the service elevator.

â€ I'm not taking
a fucking service elevator.

Just move.

Excuse me.

â€ Please.

Now, they're killing us
for less down south.

Lynching men and women.

Please don't cause a fuss here.

â™ª

â€ Get off me.

Just don't touch me.

â€ I'll take the damn service elevator
with you.

â€ Damn it.

â™ª

â™ª

[indistinct, low murmuring]

[cheers and applause]

â€ Billie!
â€ Billie!

[indistinct cheering]

WOMAN: We can't wait
to hear you sing, Billie!

MAN 1: Sing <i>Strange Fruit.</i>
MAN 2: <i>Strange Fruit,</i> Billie.

<i>â€</i> â™ª <i>Southern trees</i> â™ª

â€ Get her off that stage.

<i>â€</i> â™ª <i>Bear a strange</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Fruit â™ª</i>

[doors clattering]

â€ We gotta get the hell outta here.
â€ Hey, Prez! Get off me.

WOMAN: Hey, leave her alone!
MAN: What are you doing?

[indistinct shouting]

BILLIE:
I'm singing this goddamn song!

I'm singing this song!

[crowd shouting in distance]

MAN:
Hurry your ass up!

[car engine starts]

JOE:
You're safe here, baby.

BILLIE: Hey, Joe honey, can you get me
some ice cream, please?

â€ I don't want any ice cream.

â€ Come on, please,
baby, just go to Libby's,

right around the corner.

That sound good.
Ice cream sound good.

â€ All right, baby, I'mma get you
some ice cream, okay?

â€ Thank you, honey.
â€ Hold my head up.


What kind of ice cream you want?

â€ Chocolate ice cream,
I want chocolate ice cream.

â€ Chocolate ice cream on the way.

You ain't gettin' me no ice cream.
You can't get me shit, you.

Where you going? Ice cream that way.

â€ Mm. Go somewhere where the ice cream is.

â€ Get up, Joe.
â€ Mmâ€mm.

â€ Fine, I'll go get it myself.

â™ª "Blue Moon" playing on record â™ª

â€ Then you gotta put some clothes on.

â€ I got some clothes on.

You don't see this coat on me?

â€ Nigga, that's my coat.

â€ Shut up, stupid.

FBI AGENT:
It's in here somewhere.

â€ Joe, get up, the Feds!

â€ Both of you are under arrest.

No, Holiday. Stop, stop!

Stop!

FBI AGENT: Get up.
[indistinct chatter]

FBI AGENT: Give me your hands.
JOE: Fuck off of me, man.

BILLIE:
You drank with me backstage

pretending to be a soldier.

That's low.
â€ Punch that nigga in his face, Billie.

â€ I almost kissed your ugly ass.

You came to my baby's
goddamn funeral, Jimmy.

And all the while you're just
some fucking fed!

You probably don't like
any of my music, do you?

â€ You're under arrest, Miss Holiday.

â€ And you're a lying Black sonâ€ofâ€aâ€bitch.

â€ Policewoman will be here shortly
to search you for further evidence.

â€ You're gonna search me?

You search me.

That police bitch is only
gonna feel me up.

â€ No, ma'am.
â€ That's what you really
been wanting.

â€ Miss Holiday,
keep your clothes on, please.

â€ You gonna arrest me...

Agent Fletcher.

[breathing heavily]

[indistinct shouting]

GLASER: Keep out of the way.
WOMAN: Miss Holiday!

GLASER: Give her some room.
MAN: Miss Holiday.

â€ Billie, why did you...

GLASER: Talk to him. There.

Move, out of the way.

â€ You should feel ashamed.

You stay in trouble with the law,
Miss Holiday.

Don't you want to set
an example for your race

like Ella Fitzgerald and Marian Anderson?

â€ You know, the people that are
hardest on me are my own race.

I need help.

Not jail time.

[indistinct shouting]

â€ Move.

ANSLINGER: It's Fletcher, right?
FLETCHER: Yes, sir.

â€ Congratulations on your fine work.

â€ Thank you, Mr. Anslinger.

<i>â€ The United States vs. Billie Holiday.</i>
Docket number 14â€243.

The honorable
Judge Cullen Ganey presiding.

All rise.

JUDGE GANEY: <i>We need to know</i>
<i>the whole truth about your addiction.</i>

We want you to help us trace
the drug down to the source.

Now the police found heroin in your room
at the Attucks Hotel.

Who supplies you?

[crowd murmuring]

â€ Just send me to a hospital.
Get this over with.

â™ª

â€ Miss Holiday...

I hereby sentence you
to one year and a day...

BILLIE: To jail?
[crowd chattering in disbelief]

JUDGE GANEY: You'll be remanded
to Alderson Women's Prison.
â€ Joe! Joe!

Wait, wait! Get your hands off me!

Hey, Joe. You told me
they'd send me to a hospital.

Y'all set me up!

Y'all folks set me up.
Joe, I paid your ass all that money.

Nigga, you go to jail.

I trusted you, Joe.

[door slams]

â™ª

GUARD:
Stand up, women.

Stand up.
You ain't Billie Holiday in here.

â€ Jimmy.
â€ You did it.


â€ I'm proud of you.

â™ª



â€ Hey, Shirley, you got anything?
â€ Yes. Here you go.

[phones ringing]

SAM: They knew they couldn't
get no white boys to infiltrate Harlem.

So they had us do it
and you're leading it.

â€ Yes, Sam, I guess I am.

â€ You're paving the way for all of us.

Hoover and them white boys
better get ready.

Can't nobody do it better than a nigga
when he gets the opportunity.



â€ "You should be congratulating me
on my new job

that I start tomorrow."

You lied to me,
just like you lied to Miss Holiday.

Why wouldn't you tell me that
you're working as a federal agent?

â€ They swear you to secrecy, Mom.

â€ You could do anything with yourself.
You don't even have to work.

Why that?

â€ I didn't want to be an undertaker.

â€ The mortuary business didn't work out
so bad for us, James.

Your father's money
left you with opportunities

no ordinary Negroes have.

â€ Drugs are turning Harlem upside down.

I wanted to make a difference.

I am one of the first
Black federal agents ever.

â€ They're using you.

It's not just about the drugs.

They don't want her singing that song,

but if she don't do it, who will?

Ain't no other Negro star
bold enough to do it.

She's singing it for all of us.

That young lady is a hero.

<i>â€</i> â™ª <i>It gets worse with time</i> â™ª

MAN [on tape]:
<i>And, uh, even the recording dates,</i>

<i>Billie seemed to be so thrilled</i>
<i>to make the tape with each other.</i>

â€ I'll probably never even marry again.

I know I'm gonna find my ass
right back up in this jail cell.

â™ª <i>But here is now</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And I pray it breaks</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Your fall â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>Breaks your fall</i> â™ª

â€ Why'd you do it?

â€ My father told me when I was a kid

that drugs would be
the death of our people.

â€ For you to be one of them agents,
you sure is stupid.

I'mma tell you something real
about that person you put in jail.

She was raped...

when she was just 10 years old.

You don't know how it is
to be missing something in your life

that only a fix seems to fill.

She get with these men,

and they treat her bad.

She run around, she steal little trinkets.

She look like a million bucks,
but she feels like nothing.

Hop eases the pain,
but then that shit come right back

and it hit harder than before.

Like a hammer.

Billie ain't got nobody.

Singing is her life and...

She give that away to the world.

So, at the end of the day,
she don't hurt nobody but herself.

â€ What do you want?
â€ Mr. Anslinger?

It's Agent James Fletcher.

â€ Sit down.

[phone dialing]

[door opens]

â€ Come on.

â€ There's nothing on Holiday.

FLETCHER: Well, how can there be, sir?
She's in jail.

Pardon me for asking,

but why is that song so important to us?

â€ Hoover says it's unâ€American.

You've heard those lyrics.

They provoke people, in the wrong way.

â€ The wrong way.

What would you have me do, sir?

â€ You're a good liar.

Now, I need you to go down to the prison
and tell her you're sorry.

She'll believe you.

She's a sucker for men.

â™ª

â€ Yes, sir.

â€ We'll make sure she never gets
that cabaret license back.

â€ Miss Holiday, you can't trust anyone.

They're gonna set you up
as soon as you get out of here.

They want you down and they want me
to take you down again.

I won't.

â€ What's your game, man?

â€ I thought I was doing the right thing.

â€ Right thing, huh?

You look older, soldier boy.

[tapping desk]

â€ You said you'd kick that stuff.

Even in prison, you're beautiful.

â€ Don't flirt with me.

You ain't my kind of guy.

GUARD: Let's go.

WOMAN: That took forever.
MAN: You know how trains can be.

ROSLYN: Hey.

â€ I hate baby's breath.

â€ Hi, baby. Mommy missed you so much.

I didn't think he'd remember me.

ROSLYN:
This is Ed Fishman. He's a good manager.

BILLIE: Really?

What's he gonna do for me?

ROSLYN: Tell her.

â€ Billie Holiday headlining
at Carnegie Hall.

Headlining, kid.

â€ No one will come to see me.

I've been reading the papers.

All them nasty things
they're saying about me.

â€ Tickets went on sale yesterday

and we're selling pretty good.

â€ They just want to hear you sing, Lady.

â€ That's all.

Hey, why don't you stay at Lester's?

â€ Yeah, we can go over the numbers
and you can eat some of Mama's chitlins.

â€ Yeah, I know
what the two of y'all are thinking.

I beat it this time.

I don't plan on
doing none of that shit again.

[clears throat]

Carnegie Hall, huh?

Hot damn, Prez!
[Lester chuckles]

[indistinct chatter]

ROSLYN: Who are you smiling at?
LESTER: Shit.

ROSLYN: Oh, hell no, not that nigga.
LESTER: She's something.

â€ Take your goddamn dog. Come on.

CARTER:
Well, I'll be damned.

Your little visit to her worked.

ROSLYN: I told you not
to get goddamn baby's breath.

LESTER: They didn't have
no goddamn tulips.

What the fuck you want me to do?
Grow 'em out my ass?

BILLIE:
â™ª <i>I cried for you</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Now it's your turn to cry...</i> â™ª

Hey, Miss Mona.

â™ª <i>To cry over me</i> â™ª

Listen, Bobby, I had an idea.
â€ What?

â€ I think we should make the tune
more of a conversation, you know?

And the band take their cue
from you, Prez.

You play it. You know how you play it.

â™ª <i>I cry for you</i> â™ª


Not now, honey. Mommy's working.

â™ª <i>I cried for you</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Now it's your turn to cry over me</i> â™ª

â€ Yeah.
â€ You dig?

â€ I dig, I dig. Yeah.
â€ You think that'll work?

So glad to have you back, Lady.

BILLIE:
Yeah, I'm not feeling too bad.

[Billie grunting]

You know, I've been thinking.

I think we should integrate
the audience for the show.

You know, Blacks and whites
sitting together,

you know, if...

I feel like it would be
more of a party that way.

You know, Carnegie Hall and Broadway,
the whole scene, you know what I mean?

It's meant to keep the Negroes out.
â€ Mmâ€hmm.

â€ Let's change it up a little bit.
Do something different.

â€ It's a great idea.
â€ You know.

Oh, no. Miss Mona?

â€ Yes, Miss Holiday?

BILLIE: Honey, could you pull
that pinstripe suit out for me?

â€ Okay.
BILLIE: Yeah, I'm gonna go pray.

BILLIE: It's like the whole world's

â€ What'd I tell ya?
Packed house, Billie, packed house.

ROSLYN: Will you keep your head still?
â€ You know what? Stop! Stop!

I'll do it myself.


All right, I gotta go.

Motherfucker, what are you doing?

Who's out there right now?
ED: It's funny you should ask.

ED:
We had three lawyers working on it.

They all came back emptyâ€handed, I...

â€ Well, they won't let me sing nowhere
without my card.

No clubs, no money, no nothing.

â€ We'll work something out.

â€ You ain't working fuck out!

You son of a bitch!

â€ You're fucking high.

[glass shatters]

â€ Of course I'm high, Ed.

â€ Yep.

â€ None of your goddamn business, baby.
Now, get out there and sing a song.

â€ Prez, you know I can get arrested
for singing without my cabaret card.

â€ Bobby Tucker swears this John Levy

And he's a looker, too.
â€ Mmm.

All right, y'all.
We kinda gotta get ready for anything.

â€ Am I gonna get arrested

â€ Come here.

From now on, I don't want you

I'll pay off the right people.

â€ And you would do that for me?

â€ You just got a standing ovation

and three curtain calls from
a soldâ€out crowd at Carnegie Hall.

Plus, the cops owe me some favors.

You and me might make a swell team.

â€ Only I decide when
it's time to team up that way.

â€ You got a divorce from Monroe,
didn't you?

â€ That ain't none of your business.

Shit. I'm here to sing.

Make you some money.

Hey, Levy!

Goddamn! You done shorted me

He's really just a boxer and a damn pimp.
He's trouble.

â€ Your table is ready, Miss Holiday.
Just this way.

â€ Luigi, that ain't necessary.

Miss Holiday will be dining

â€ Oh.

That's mighty swell of you.

Ain't that nice, Ros.

Come on, let's go.

You could do better.
They're all using you.

â€ What makes you think I'm not using him?

Mister, knock it off. Come on.

You'll never understand my life,
white girl.

[indistinct chatter]

â€ So you really just here to hang out?


FREDDY: You know he got

BILLIE: Hey, Candyman.

â€ Let me blow a bubble.

â€ What you get?

All right. Here's what we got.

LESTER:
Yeah, that is all we got.

â€ Okay.

â€ I sure hope you gave him enough for me.

â€ You know, I did.
â€ Shut the fuck up, Freddy.

â€ What, you mad

[all laugh]

FREDDY: He be gettin' so mad

LESTER: We'll do...

â€ Uhâ€oh. Wait. Wait.
Mmâ€mm. Mmâ€mm.

So, Billie, how you gonna pay

But I ain't got nothing.

â€ Come on, Ros.

Y'all know I need my medicine.

â€ Medicine, my ass.

â€ You knew what you
was getting yourself into

when you decided to come on the road.

ROSLYN: Shut up, Freddy.
I wasn't even talking to you.

FREDDY:

ROSLYN: Shut the fuck up.
BILLIE: The hell you do.

Nah, Freddy...
FREDDY: That bitch don't pay me my money,

I take her shit.
â€ Get outta my goddamn clothes.

â€ I'm just letting you know
I'm gonna take everything

I can't wear a gown. I ain't gonna...

BILLIE:
If you gonna do it, do it right.

Here.
â€ Hey, Fletcher.

You're gonna follow us around
the whole country in that car?

â€ I ain't got nothing better to do.

â€ I trust you about as far as I can
throw your ass.

ROSLYN: Oh.

â€ The Lady trusts me.

â€ No, I don't.

[all laugh]

LESTER:
You better damn not.

ROSLYN:
All right, now shut up. This is serious.

BILLIE: Here we go.

â€ Hypothetically speaking, all right?

Let's say you catch Freddy.

Now, even though he don't have
no drugs on hand,

in the trunk of his car,
there is a considerable amount.

What then?
â€ She said "considerable amount."

â€ You drive around with drugs
in the trunk of your car?

â€ She said, "Hypothetically."
Nigga, I don't even got no car.

You see me driving a car,
that shit is stolen.

I promise you that.
[all laugh]

â€ Well, if it's your car,

then they could probably bust you
for possession or something.

BILLIE: Damn.
â€ Now that's some ridiculous shit.

â€ Why the FBI shittin' on me?

â€ All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's keep this party going.

It is time for the main event.

ROSLYN: Okay.
Well, it's time for me to go.
Y'all have a blessed night.

BILLIE: Come on, Ros.
You ain't got to go!

You ain't got to go!
ROSLYN: It's all right.

â€ How about we...

How about we go back to New York?

Hmm?

Take you in my car, we can...

get you the help you need.

â€ No, that's not gonna work.

You gotta find you a nice girl, okay?

And that ain't me.

I know what you thinking.

Me, I only know a certain

At least what you and I got here is...

I don't understand this.

I don't feel in control.

â€ Billie.

You called saying you were stranded,

so I drove all night to get here.

Let's go.

We got a plane to catch.

â€ I'm coming.

LOUIS: Billie, let's go.

â€ I'm sorry, Jimmy.
â€ Yeah.

FREDDY: Billie, I know

We got no damn gas money to get home.

You don't do this shit to family.

GEORGE JESSEL:
Now, let's get on with this straight.

In the more realistic sense,

the big comeback of her career
was launched not tonight,

but over five years ago,

when there was a year of darkness.

When she fell victim to one
of society's most dreaded illnesses,

the use of narcotics.

Billie, it's a privilege
to have you with us tonight.

â€ Thank you, George.
It's an honor to be here.

â€ Now, Billie, this is the usual part
of our procedure in this show

where we introduce from the audience
the family of our guests,

those near ones who were there,

<i>to give the strength and security needed</i>

<i>when their kinfolk are in trouble.</i>

<i>But there's no one here</i>
<i>to remember for Billie.</i>

<i>No family.</i>

<i>Not a single relative that she knows.</i>

<i>â€ Yes, well, I have my husband.</i>

Mr. Louis McKay.

Jimmy, they're going

So you have to do something, Jimmy,

So you have to do something, you hear me?
You have to do something.

FLETCHER: Shh.


â€ Anslinger's going to plant
heroin on her.

ANSLINGER: Hello, sweetie.

My wife is a big fan.

â€ She understands what you need.

Billie and me discussed things.

She hasn't been well, but she's sorry
for the trouble she's caused

and she's ready to help.

â€ For the record, I'm going to need you
to state your name.

â€ My name is Billie Holiday.

LOUIS: Go on, Lady.
Go ahead and speak your peace.

â€ You're a victim of drugs.

We know that.

â€ I blame nobody but myself.

â€ Go ahead and tell 'em
what you need to tell 'em, baby.

â€ Ms. Holiday,
you want to clear your name, right?

Get us off your case
and you'll never see us again.

â€ You think I'm going
to stop singing that song?

Your grandkids

Y'all motherfuckers think

You don't.

You stupid bitches don't got shit on me.
