I'm so tired I could stay here all day.

Every bone in my body needs rest.

Good. Start with your jawbone.

Okay, it's zipped.

Thank you. Sweet dreams.

Come on, get up! You're late!

Roma!

I can't believe
we're gonna be here all summer.

How cool is that?
It's beyond cool!

So much to do, so much to see.

The culture, the history,
the incredible food.

The Italian boys.

And it's all very good.

I can't believe this place is 2,700 years old.

There is some big-time history here.

I mean, the Roman empire,
gladiators, Michelangelo...

Versace.

And don't forget Caesar,
and I'm not just talking about salad.

And it's all ours for six weeks.

Do you think
they'll let us work on a fashion shoot?

Doubtful.
I mean, we are only summer interns.

Well, mailroom interns.

But wouldn't it be cool to do
something meaningful for the company?

Something special?
Like be on time our first day?

Guys, we're late!

Paolo. Come on! Get up, man.

Heidi, you think Derek Hammond
is going to be there?

Dari, relax. It's just a summer job!

Buongiorno is good morning
and ciao is hello.

Or goodbye.

A word that means both hello
and goodbye.

Man, we're way behind schedule, okay?
I don't live by schedule.

This summer you do. This internship
could be a great opportunity.

I'm gonna make the most of this.
Come on!

Derek Hammond runs an airline...

a hot record company, a top fashion line,
and a dozen magazines.

He's one of the most powerful men
in the world!

Ma che sei matto!
No, I'm not nuts. We're late. Let's go.

And you know what they say about Italian.
It's the language of romance.

Well, I haven't met anyone
worthy of romance.

We just flew 13 hours from Los Angeles
over the Arctic circle...

and came straight here
from the Roma Airport.

The only person that we've met
so far was the cab driver.

Nice shoes.

All I'm saying is
it would've been much easier...

to work at the mall this summer.

Charli, this is a great opportunity
for us to learn about the fashion business.

I mean, in the center of the fashion world!

I'm sure we'll make a mistake or two,
but we'll be fine.

And maybe we'll even run into
Giorgio Armani.

Come on, interns! Hustle it up!

Scusa. Mi dispiace.

Hello, Rome.

I am Paolo.
I'm impressed.

I'm Charli.

Paolo, you can let her go now.

But why?

Not all of you have met,
so why don't we introduce ourselves?

I'm Jami. I'm a Senior VP
here at Hammond Enterprises...

and I am your Summer Internship Director.

I am from New Jersey, U.S.A.

You?
Daria. Venice, Italy.

I'm Nobu. Tokyo, Japan.

Leila. Los Angeles, California.

Charli. The same.

I'm Paolo, from right here in Roma.

Heidi. Munich, Germany.

Great. Now that we're all well-acquainted,
let's hurry because we're late.

Wait. Let me catch my breath for a sec.

These are the Spanish Steps.
Completed in 1726.

The original Stairmaster!

We're in Italy.
We're on Spanish steps. Weird.

Is that what you Americans call jokes?

No, jokes are funny.

We're meeting Derek Hammond, right?
One never knows.

Come on, we're late. Let's go.

Hi. Sorry.

Benvenuti, welcome. Buongiorno.

Grazie. I am so thirsty.
Can I have some orange juice, please?

Can I get an iced tea or something?
Or bagels? We're hungry.

Interns...

may I introduce you
to signor Enrico Tortoni.

He heads up the Roma offices.

I am so sorry about
the whole orange juice thing.

No offense taken,
Miss Leila Hunter of Los Angeles.

You know her name?
I know all your names, signorina Charli.

You will be working for me,
so it's good that I know, no?

Please, my regular table is waiting.

But I thought we were working
for Derek Hammond.

Sorry to disappoint, Dari, but you know...

Mr. Hammond is in New York one day,
Paris the next.

Me, I am always here.

And you are 47 minutes late.

It's their first day,
and with the jet lag and everything it's...

Yes. Please. I'm just joking.

Welcome to Roma.

So you will spend the summer
working in our mailroom?

Making deliveries and performing
other important tasks.

And all the while learning
about an international corporation?

For our business, or any business
to be successful...

everyone, from bottom to top,
must do their job and do it right.

You people are very important to me.

We picked you from amongst...
Ecco il suo caffé.

We picked you from amongst
hundreds of other applicants.

Delizioso.

So sorry to be so brief,
but I have a meeting at the office.

Enjoy the food.
Thank you.

I wish you the best. Arrivederci.
Arrivederci.

I like Mr. Tortellini.
Tortoni.

I expect you at the office in 15 minutes.

Welcome to Roma,
Hammond International...

and the world's fastest breakfast ever.

Okay, but in all seriousness, guys,
Mr. Hammond will be picking two of you...

to be his personal assistants
in New York next summer.

So we're all competing with each other?

I speak good English, so we have
many problem with communication.

If you speak good English...

don't you mean that we won't
have any communication problems?

Correct! I speak good English,
you speak good English...

we no communicate at all.

Gianni funny?

Laugh! Have much fun! Enjoy! Ridete!

This guy is a piece of cake.

No more, that's enough!

Pay attention. This is Gianni Rigoletti's
mailroom. Capire? Understand?

No jokes, no playing around...

no romance. Just work.

Now let's sort mail.

Presto!

Paolo and Charli,
I have your first assignment.

You are to take
these two boxes of fabric...

to San Pastriani at the fabric shop
at Piazza Del Giorno.

You must get these there
within the hour, capito?

We're counting on you.

We are so lost.

I mean, why don't you know
where we are? You live here.

You can live in Roma 100 years
and not know these crazy streets.

Well, I'll check the map.

The map? You don't need this.

You're so Americana.

Paolo, I am so close
to getting in your face.

I have no problem with our faces
getting closer.

Okay.

Some packages are not meant
to be delivered.

I'm not giving up.
When I have a job to do, I get it done.

Okay.

We're delivering mail, and Paolo and Charli
are out riding Vespas.

Paolo is very cute.
Not for me.

You have a boyfriend back home?

No, Paolo's not for me because I think
my sister might be interested.

You don't compete with your sister?

No. I don't and I won't.

Well, I'm not your sister.

Grazie. Okay, ciao.

Leila! Heidi!

Hey, there you go.

You're a fashion designer?

Sort of. I do manage the design team.

So a successful internship
can lead to good things.

It's not the yellow brick road to Oz,
but you do get your foot in the door.

What are you working on?
Right now we are designing...

our spring line
for an Elle fashion magazine shoot...

and Bruno Fillitti is shooting.

Fillitti is an amazing photographer.

His black-and-white Armani campaign
was mesmerizing.

You know your photography.
It could make or break our season.

I have an important assignment for you.
Please go to the hat shop...

and pick up the newly designed cap
for Mr. Hammond's personal pilot.

Right away, Mr. Tortoni.

This is no challenge.

This is so easy. A monkey could do this.

Then why didn't they hire monkeys?
Exactly.

Piazza Del Popolo, presto.

Our first hour of work and I failed.

Grazie. A presto.

Okay, look where you are. Is this bad?

Okay, dig the tour,
but we have deliveries to make!

I love my city.

You're so passionate about Rome.

But yet you're not at all interested
in the intern program.

The intern program, yeah.
But my partner? I'm very interested.

Okay, if we're partners,
let's work together.

Ciao, Vittorio.
Buongiorno, Paolo.

Grazie di essere venuto.
Stanno qua dietro.

Vittorio's delivered pizza
to every address in Roma.

He's taking our packages.
He is delivering the packages for us.

It's no problem.
Now we can spend time together.

Italian boys. I was warned.

Here we are.

The last of 240 collated
and bound copies...

of the third-quarter-record
fiscal company budget.

Record budget? We are supposed
to be copying the airline press release.

What?

Oh, no!

Where's that monkey when you need him?

Buongiorno.

I'm looking for a pilot's hat.

You know...

airplane? You know, wings, cockpit.

Ho capito. Sí, ho capito.

Grazie!

I'm very disappointed.

You two make 240 copies
of the wrong document.

You were supposed to deliver fabric...

but instead
our deliveries get pepperoni pizzas.

And, Leila, I'm, well, surprised.

Was there a problem with the hat?

Does this look like a pilot's cap?

I am so sorry, Mr. Tortoni,
there should be no excuse.

I dislike doing this, but everyone...

other than Heidi, is on probation.

Mr. Tortoni, it's their first day.
Okay, preliminary probation.

Preliminary probation? What's that?

I am running a company here.

I cannot tolerate these incidents.

The next time...

Well, let's not have a next time.

What was that all about?

I can't believe we almost got fired
from a summer job...

and it's not even summer.

Our parents would be so upset!

Hey, guys, concentrate on doing things
right and you'll do them right.

Easy for you to say.
You lucked out with interoffice mail.

You couldn't get a copy order right?
A monkey could do that.

Can you guys please stop fighting?
We're a team, remember?

You took this too serious.
Paolo, we have a situation here.

It's your first day in Roma.
Can we please...

how you say, chill and have some fun?

Are we ever going to meet
Derek Hammond?

Yeah, I know. It's strange.

Our first day as interns, and the CEO
of a multinational corporation...

hasn't fallen all over himself
to come meet us.

Yeah, I don't think that he even exists.

Don't you want a photo
of your Internship Director?

Sure!
Okay.

Okay, just a little bit to your right.

You're really serious about this.

Well, to capture an image, freeze time...

make a moment last forever...

it's all good.

And this is Roma.

Fun, alive...

and not a tight-up.
Uptight.

Oh, yes.

Can I make...

I think it's called generalization.
All American girls are uptight.

How do you know
so many American girls?

I am in trouble now.
Yes.

I meet many tourists.

And you're digging yourself deeper.
Much deeper.

You really psyched about this summer?
Absolutely.

I mean, this is a dream come true.

I meet them at work.

So maybe you drive a tour bus.

But that won't work 'cause you won't find
anything with your zero sense of direction.

It seems like you have some goals.

Well...

set goals, I'm not so sure.

But I know what I like:

Fashion, photography.

This summer I'm getting
the opportunity to get a little taste of that.

And if you like the taste?

After college
maybe I'll be working for you.

Maybe you work at customs
at the airport!

And you meet tons
of American women there!

But that wouldn't be it because that job
you need to be very punctual, so...

Sorry, Charli, if I'm rude, but relax.

Chill.

Be mellow. Be cool. Be Italian.

Tomorrow is a new day,
so we're not gonna worry about...

Do we get to spend it together?
Certamente.

I guess I'll take that as a yes.
Sí.

Buongiorno, signor Tortoni.
Leila!

It's going good, no?

I'm starting to get a grasp
on your corporation.

Tell me.
Well...

Your magazine promotes your fashions
and your recording artists.

Your recording artists
wear your fashions...

and you push your magazines
and music on your airplanes.

One might think your divisions don't fit.

But they complement each other, right?

Yes. It's called vertical integration.

Leila, you are a very smart young lady.

And I know you will be very valuable
to us this summer.

You like music?

This is a hot new artist we just recorded
at our London studios.

Take Heidi...

and deliver this to signor Piranesi.

He's my inside source
at Roma's top radio station.

Sure, Mr. Tortoni,
I'll take care of it right away.

And any time you wanna talk,
my door is open.

Thank you. Ciao.
Ciao.

Heidi, stop.
What?

According to the Tommaso Guida...

we're going in the wrong direction.

But if we go down there and make a left...

Aren't you at least curious
to hear this hot new artist?

We're already on probation.
Let's just deliver this.

So we have to get the coffee ready
for the break.

As long as it's easy.

So this is either modern art...

or the coffee machine.
That's espresso machine.

Espresso?
Yeah.

Coffee with a colossal kick.

There's nothing more important
to a Roman than their caffé ristretto...

or what you Americans call espresso.

You know how to work this thing?

Here are the instructions.

Very few step. Very simple.

I'll be back in 20 minutes
with the pastries.

So I just follow the directions.
Of course.

Okay?

'Bye.
'Bye.

Okay, a few steps. Very simple.

Just follow the directions.

Smooth sailing, Dari.
We did good, Nobu.

We are definitely as smart as a monkey.

Goodbye, preliminary probation.

Okay, so we put the thing in here...

pull it.

I feel like I'm in chemistry class.

Okay, then we put this in...

where?

We'll put it there.

Pull it.

There it is across the street.

We have to listen to that CD.
Hey.

Give it to me!
No.

What are you afraid of?
Our jobs, genius!

Give it to me!
Give it to me!

Oh, no.

I can't believe it.

Ciao, Charli.
Ciao.

You know what? At first, I didn't think
I was gonna be able to pull it off...

but the coffee is looking pretty good.

Instant coffee.

Instant coffee in Roma.

Are you impazziti?

Crazy.

Sir, it's just coffee.

Forse per gli Americani. In Roma...

coffee is a ritual.

As close to a religious experience
as anything.

Sir, the espresso was my fault.

What would she know about that?

Sí, bravo.

That's very noble of you, Paolo,
but Charli could've asked for help.

But she took the easy way out.

Le dia un'altra possibilitá.
Silenzio.

You can go.

Send in Leila and Heidi.

I'm a big girl.
It was my mess up, and I'll deal with it.

Okay, I just tried to be nice.

Just forget about it.

Leila and Heidi.

I am beyond upset about the CD.

Leila, I gave you a responsibility
and you were irresponsible.

I'm so sorry, sir.
Sorry, sorry.

I'm hearing that way too much
from my American interns.

You have anything to add?

It was an accident, signor Tortoni.

But it was preventable...

as I warned Leila not to open the CD.

I was wrong and it'll never happen again.

No. It definitely will not.

You can go.

What was up with that?
You caused the CD mess!

That's not what Tortoni thinks.

One last thing.

We recruited you to help us,
not disappoint us.

So in the interest of the company,
Leila and Charli, you're terminated.

Let's go.

I'm humiliated. Mortified.

And worse, I'm disappointed in myself.

Yeah, Mr. Tortoni
has been oversensitive lately.

Personally, I think he overreacted.

We were fired over instant coffee.

I'd call that an overreaction.

At least you get to see the Trevi Fountain.

They say if you throw a coin
in the fountain, you'll return to Rome.

No coin tossing.

I mean, after this nightmare,
I don't know when we'll be back to Rome.

Have you ever been so upset
that you want to cry, you need to cry...

but you just can't cry
because it doesn't seem real?

Hey, Lei.

Life goes on.

Thanks for cheering me up.

Yeah, I'll save my tears
for the plane flight home.

We do have 13 hours to go.

And we have three at the airport.

I mean, that gives us 16 hours to cry.

We never even met Derek Hammond.

Is that good or bad?

I tried to get you a message, but...
You succeeded, Jami.

I understand that Leila and Charli...
You know our names?

I know everything
about my summer interns.

I'm not quite as out of the loop
as everyone thinks.

We messed up, Mr. Hammond. I'm sorry.

Enrico Tortoni has been with me
since the beginning.

I trust him like a brother
and I respect his decisions.

However, nothing is final unless I say so.

Your suitcases are packed. Good.

How is that a good thing?

It's gonna take me a little bit of time
to work on Enrico.

In the meantime
there's no point in going back to L.A.

So I'd like to invite you and Miss Martin...

to my seaside villa
for a few days of fun and sun.

My helicopter's waiting.
It's a 30-minute flight to the beach.

But, sir, I have a job.
You're taking a few days off, end of story.

If Enrico's got a problem with it,
well, he can take it up with me.

You know...

eighteen years ago,
a penniless, backpacking student...

stood right here at the Trevi Fountain.

He made a wish and threw in a coin...

his last coin.

Did his wish come true?

More than I ever imagined.

And now, it's your turn.

One, two, three!

There are some spectacular shots.

My camera's gonna be quite content
hanging with Hammond.

You know, unemployment is not that bad.

Okay, the setup is nice,
but I do want my job back.

So do I...

you know,
after about three, four more weeks of this.

Okay. Four days of this.

Three days.

You know, I think the reason we're here
is Hammond has a thing for you.

No. Mr. Hammond and I work together.
There is no thing.

Okay.

So, Charli, you think you'll ever talk
to Paolo again?

That was a great change of subject.

You know, I don't think Paolo and I
would have ever really gotten along.

He thinks
I'm a way-too-uptight American...

and I think he's a way-too-laid-back Italian.

Like oil and vinegar.

Yeah, they might not mix real well...

but you put them on a salad
and it turns out to be a great combination.

Ha fatto un buon viaggio, signore?
Eccellente.

I've got some excellent branzino,
fresh off a local fishing boat.

Have Carlo prepare this
for me and my guests.

Va bene, sará fatto, signore. Grazie.
Grazie, Massimo.

Do you mind if I look at your sketches?

Yeah. It's just doodles.

I've been in the fashion business
for 10 years...

and this is way beyond doodling.

You know, Lei and I are into fashion...

and that's why we wanted
to become interns.

I want to show these to Mr. Hammond.
No, Jami. Please.

Okay. It's your call.

Derek, you're back.
And I bring news with me.

I just got off the phone
with Enrico Tortoni.

What'd he say?

If you're late Monday morning,
you're back on probation.

We're back in?
We're back in?

Grazie!
Thank you.

I've got Carlo preparing lunch.
We'll eat on the veranda.

Actually, I'm not that hungry.

I think I'm just gonna hang around
and sketch.

Yeah, you know,
I'll go by the water and take some shots.

Yeah?
Thank you.

See you. 'Bye.

It's just you and me.
Yeah.

You think they planned that?

This intern program does no good.

Hammond runs around the world...

leaves me with six kids who know nothing
and get in my way.

Hammond is foolish.

Six? You fired Leila and Charli.

Hammond rehired the Americans.

Good. I like them very much.

No, no. I like a little. Very little.

I don't like interns.
I should do all the work.

Everything.
Let Gianni do everything, right?

Exactly.

Are you crazy?

I didn't expect to see you.
There's not usually people around here.

I'm sorry.
It's okay. I'm fine.

I'm Leila.
I'm Ryan.

An American?
Better. New Yorker.

I'm from Los Angeles. I'm staying
with Mr. Hammond at his villa.

My sister and I are interning
at his company.

Hammond.

Oh, yeah. The big business guy
with the fancy house.

Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

Sure. But I don't like to go fast.

Don't worry. I'll take it easy.

Slow down!

What do you think?

You like it? Check this out.

I didn't go too fast, did I, Leila?

Thank God I didn't eat lunch.
Yeah, you'd be wearing it.

My turn to drive.

I didn't go too fast, did I, Ryan?
You're nuts.

But I deserved it.
Ryan!

What did I tell you about driving like that?

Sorry, Uncle Derek. It won't happen again.

Explain.

Hammond's my uncle,
and I'm staying with him for the summer.

Alone?

No, I'm not alone. I got my friends.

Miss Speedboat, Mr. Dune Buggy,
Uncle Harley-Davidson, surfboard.

I'd be totally bored.

Leila, lighten up.
I thought you L.A. Types were laid back.

Why aren't you in the intern program?
What is this, 20 questions?

It would just seem natural.

I mean, the intern program's in Rome,
you're very close.

I mean, if the shoe fits...

Sun and fun. Where's the bad, Leila?

You're all by yourself.

No, I'm not. Not today.

Talk about the town that time forgot.

No. This is the town that I bought.

You own this town?
Every leaking roof.

Actually, some of the buildings
don't have roofs.

Yeah, it's a bit of a fixer-upper.

I know it sounds crazy...

but I want to restore this town.
I want to make it an artists' colony...

so that talented people
from all over the world can come here...

and create without having to worry
about paying the rent.

Remember, I was a starving artist once.

I like everything about your idea.

Words of support
from my first-ever intern.

That's right. Eleven years ago.

I've been a good boss, though, haven't I?
Yeah.

I mean, I've been very professional...

and kept my distance.

You still do.

We work together.

Yes. We work together.

Look, now, I wish there was a solution.

There's always supposed to be a solution,
isn't there?

I have a solution.
What?

You're fired.

What?

You're joking, right?

Wait up!

Tortoni likes us.
We are not screw-up like Leila and Charli.

A very reliable source told me
you screwed up the CD.

You believe that? She was fired.

I think more of us will be fired.
Something is up. I feel it.

I'm not worried.

As long as the two Americans are gone,
things will be good.

You guys, great news.

Charli and Leila
have been rehired by Mr. Hammond.

All right.

It is so great here.

Was it this nice when you were an intern?

Mr. Hammond had just started his career.

So a big outing for us
was a slice of pizza at the outdoor vendor.

The freshest fish you ever tasted
will be ready in 30 minutes.

You know, when you go back to work...

No, you two are very smart.
I don't need to tell you anything.

We'd love to hear your words of wisdom.
I mean, you are Derek Hammond.

Words, yes, wisdom...

Be clever, be conscientious, be calm...

be cooperative, be consistent, be creative.

And most important of all, be confident.

Remember, Jami?

Hammond's seven "C's".
I remember them well.

But enough talk about business.

Let's check out the night sky.

Why don't you go and enjoy the stars?
I want to talk with Leila.

I invited Ryan here this summer...

hoping proximity
would get him interested in the program.

What's your Plan B?
You're good.

Inviting you and your sister to the beach...

hoping Ryan would bond
and would want to give work a try.

That rocks. Look up there.

What's Plan C?

I was hoping you'd have one.

Give me time. I'll figure something out.

I'm sure you will.

You know, Jami's very nice
and not to mention beautiful.

Leila, Jami is my employee.

Have you ever seen The Sound Of Music?

She worked for him.

And their relationship
turned out pretty darn good.

Do you like The Sound Of Music?
I love it. It's in my top 10.

Good.

I'd like to discuss it with you
over a martini.

Okay.

Hey, Leila.

After Sunday,
I'm not going to see you anymore.

I'm really excited to go back to work.

I'm totally bummed.

I've become the fifth wheel
and the lone astronomer.

Why don't you come with us?
You know, work for your Uncle D.

Am I ever going to see you again?

Don't know.

It was just to say good night.

A handshake will do.

Charli Hunter has returned.

Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

É molto bella.
I feel the same way.

Che cos'é, this little thing?
This is a GPS monitor.

GP... What?
A global positioning system.

Charli, I'm very glad you're back.
Me, too.

And what are we doing now,
bird watching?

We're beaming.

We're not beaming,
but the satellite's beaming.

But I'm beaming just the same.

You, like me, appreciate moments.

Moments like this.

Moments. Si.

It works.
Okay.

So, let's go.

You're okay with this?
Too late to turn back now.

Mail call!

Barcelona, Spain: Spanish.

Bangkok, Thailand: Thai.

Beijing, China: Chinese.

Planning equals smooth sailing.

I should apologize to Leila. Right?

You should apologize to Leila.

Right?

Okay, this is it.

Four deliveries already.
We'll be done in no time.

Charli, you're very good.

Don't thank me.

The hem needs to be shorter,
at least an inch.

I don't know. It doesn't work.

Jami, two inches for sure.
Assolutamente no.

The hem is just right.
Mr. Tortoni thinks it's perfect.

We've delivered the mail in record time.
Yes.

We'll do Jami, and we're done.

Very innovative.
Innovation, I like.

And efficient, no? I like that, too.

I totally concur
with signor Tortoni's assessment.

Derek. Didn't expect to see you.

Hello, Mr. Hammond.
Hello, Miss Martin.

Leila, Dari, very creative.

We better get back to the mailroom.
Wait a minute.

We've got some future shoppers here.

What do you think of the clothes?

I love them.

Leila?
They're nice.

Now, come on. The truth.
Yes. Please enlighten us.

Well, your target demographic is what?

Eighteen to thirty?

Young, stylish, carefree, but sophisticated.

These clothes seem more geared
to an older audience...

which is fine, but not really your target.

But what do I know?

Fine. Raise the hem two inches.

Better get back to the mailroom.

We have the fabric.

So we're done
and two hours ahead of schedule.

Let's head back to the office.

They give us three hours to deliver it
and we do it in one.

Three hours minus one
gives us two hours to do as we please.

Paolo, it's my first day back
from being fired.

And you're doing great. Follow me.
Okay.

And this is the Coliseum,
built 2,000 years ago.

You know, 55,000 Romans
would fill this place.

Men, and some women,
would battle to the death.

Do you know this place?

I saw Gladiator. Twice.

Russell Crowe.

Mamma mia!
I'm talking about real history.

So I suppose you never saw Gladiator.
Four times.

You know so much about Rome.

I love it here.

So, then, why don't you
make the most of the program...

so you can get a job with Hammond
in Rome in a few years?

It's not what I want.
I have other interests and passions.

Like what?
Come with me and I'll show you.

Okay.

And this is my passion.

If you want to be a chef,
why are you in the program?

Mr. Hammond likes to eat here.

My father and my grandfather
were chefs here.

But now they think it's no future for me.

No. Okay, with your palms.

Okay, this way. Don't press too much.

Mamma mia! Ehi, Paolo!

Okay, and now the fun part.

I can't do that.

Okay, fine. My first pizza toss.

Charli, go for it.

Okay. It's no problem.
Okay.

We'll share my pizza,
and I'll make us pasta al pomodoro.

I have an idea.

Buongiorno.
Buongiorno.

Grazie, nonno.
Prego.

Tortoni will love this.

I'll be so good,
Starbucks will be recruiting me.

Star... Who?

Surprise!
Yeah, I'm surprised.

What are you doing here?

I took the train up.
I thought maybe we could go out.

Now?
Yeah.

No.

It's Rome. It's summer.
And we both have nothing to do.

I'm not interested.

I was going to take you for the best
gelato, I mean, ice cream, in the world.

In the whole world?

Do you have a favorite ice cream?
No. I have about five favorites.

This gelato's going to be 10 times better.

Trust me.
Trust you?

Sorry. Taste for yourself.

You were right.
The best ice cream ever.

Is everything okay?
Yeah.

So, I need you to tell me something.
Okay.

Be honest. Why don't you really like me?

I like you.
Come on, be serious.

We only have two hours and there's not
really enough time to explain that one.

Ouch! Am I that bad?

Come on. Now you have to tell me.

Fine. Here goes.

You're spoiled, sort of obnoxious,
and kind of...

arrogant.
Don't sugarcoat it, please.

And the clincher is
you're happy being that way.

Okay, I don't mean to be harsh...

but your uncle would be so happy
if you just join the program.

Or just do something
more challenging than...

apply SPF 25, everyday, all day.

That's why he invited me to Italy
for the summer.

He wants to instill
some sort of work ethic in me.

But I'm never going to be like him.

So it's, why bother trying?

I'm only 17.

You're right. You should just play
with your uncle's toys all summer.

Do the kids know we're seeing each other?

Why? Am I not supposed to say anything?

Kissing, and you and I dating,
that's something I wanted.

I just don't know if it's something
I want the kids to see.

You're right. We're the example,
so I guess we should keep it to ourselves.

Charli and Paolo have a flirtation.

I think Nobu and Dari have something, too.

Our interns are not here to date.

They're here to work
and learn about work.

And, quite frankly, to impress us.

But...

I know how difficult it is
to put aside feelings.

We've been doing it for years.

It was difficult for me today at the office.

We're not in the office now.

This is delicious.
I mean, you're a great chef.

Grazie.

If this is what you want
to do with your life, do it.

Why don't you show Mr. Hammond
your sketches?

They're molto belli.
You've seen my sketches?

My sister and I are interested in fashion
and that's why we're here.

But we also know our place.

My espresso is world-class.

My pizza, on the other hand,
is now unfortunately a ceiling tile.

Someone famous once said,
"What goes up, must come down."

They don't know you.

Did all 180 employees suddenly
leave the building for their break?

I hear someone coming.

Sorry. The break
should have started 10 minutes ago.

Okay. I don't usually care
much for this stuff...

but for my interns, I will be a pioneer.

Or a sacrificial lamb.

Mr. Tortoni, I will let you be the judge.

Perfetto. This is old-world delicious.

Just like my grandfather used to make.

If he only knew.

Excellent, Charli.

I think this is going to be a great summer.

Mail call! Mail call!

I have to give you a raise.

What? I love this car.

Besides, with the parking in Rome,
it's perfect.

But I'll take the raise.

I love St. Peter's.

So much history.

Like us.

Derek, I'm thinking
of quitting your company.

The company is secondary.

The most important thing is you and I.

But maybe we can have it all.

Let's start a new history.

I'm going ballooning tomorrow
in the French Alps. Come with me.

Ballooning?

Like, way up high?
Way, way up high.

Can we start a new history
when you get back from ballooning?

It's a date.

Come on. Let's go.

I can't believe
you've got me playing hooky.

Leila.
Buongiorno, signor Tortoni.

Just delivering your mail.
With ingenuity and style, I might add.

Thank you. I better get going.

Wait one moment.

I want you to know that I'm very pleased
with the hard work...

that you and Charli have shown.

You have proven the termination wrong,
and for that, I am glad.

Thank you for a second chance.
Have a good day.

Ciao.
Ciao.

Hello?
Ryan, I need you to come to Rome.

Is it a date? I thought
you couldn't stand the sight of me.

No, for work.
It'll be your first summer job.

A job, job?

Ryan, do something productive
and gain some respect.

At least for me.

That means something, right?
Leila, it means everything.

Good. I'm looking forward to it. Ciao.

When will they tell us
who's going to New York?

Leila for sure.

I would go to New York for one reason:
To sample the pizza.

Guys, guys. Tortoni.

Interns, the clothes
for the magazine shoot must be cleaned.

The cleaners is only a short way,
so you can walk it there.

Wait for the clothes to be cleaned.

Two hours maximum
and bring them back.

Do you trust these cleaners?
For 11 years.

What if they ruin the clothes?

Too much worrying.

You have done such a great job
I have decided to treat you to lunch...

at my favorite café
on the way to the cleaners.

And I know that teenagers
like to be with teenagers...

so lunch is just for you.
Everything is taken care of.

Go, eat, and enjoy. Ciao.

We'll bring you leftovers.

Sorry, I'll be a little late for lunch.

I saw a pair of shoes on the via Condotti
and I must get them before they're gone.

Women and shopping. It never ends.

Charli, where's Leila?
She's out to lunch with Ryan.

She is lucky. We get the bad jobs.

No. I mean, we're interns.

Mailroom interns. This is what we do.

You have the best attitude.

You and your sister
are going to get asked to New York, I bet.

Hanging with you is not really work.

Are you on the beach?
No.

Are you my driver?
Yeah.

Then you are officially employed, Ryan.

Everyone bailed on this lunch.

Paolo had to work at his restaurant.
Yeah, but Dari?

I can't believe she'd miss out
on a free lunch for shoes.

Depends on the shoes.

You must be Mr. Tortoni's special guests.

Just three of you?
Yeah.

Okay, he has arranged everything.
The antipasto buffet is inside.

What should we do with the clothes?
No problem. I'll watch them.

Don't worry. Ci penso io.

Okay. Grazie.

We can't forget to bring Gianni leftovers.
Yeah, leftovers.

So do you have
just a little bit of respect for me now?

I have a little respect for you.

Was that "a little respect",
or "little respect"?

There's a big difference. Which is it?

I need to get these shots.

This food looks great.

In Rome there's no such thing
as a bad meal.

That Tortoni is a real sport.
Yeah.

I think we had him all wrong. I like him.

Yeah. He's pretty cool.
Mangiamo.

Oh, my gosh. The clothes!
Oh, no!

Tortoni's going to flip!

Where is Leila?
I don't know.

Interesting.

Fillitti is unreachable.
He's shooting swimwear...

on some Fijian island.
And I can't track Mr. Hammond.

He's hot air ballooning
over the French Alps.

So it's my call.

I think we should wait
until we talk to Mr. Hammond.

I think you should know your place
in this company, Miss Martin.

I have one thing to say to you
and your missing friends.

You're fired.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have your many mistakes to correct.

Those designs took over a year of my life.

We're sorry.

We're really sorry.

Just none of this makes sense!

I wish we had an explanation.
I mean, or a solution.

Yeah, I do, too.

This isn't the way
I wanted to say goodbye.

We are so, how do you say, lame?

No, that's putting it kindly.
I was fired twice.

I mean, when Leila finds out,
she's going to freak.

I have a flight to Munich in two hours.

Of course. Rats are always
the first to leave a burning ship.

Nobu, I hope to never see you again.

Absolutely no problem.

Hi. God, I'm glad you're still here.

I wanted to have a real farewell.

I'm not ready to say my goodbyes.

I had this crazy idea.

Okay.

We'll set up the fashion shoot ourselves.

Yes, that qualifies as crazy.

Charli, we were fired.

There's no clothes.
There's no fashion shoot.

Which part of this fiasco
haven't you grasped yet?

Okay, but I have my sketchbook.

And we know where to get the fabrics.

I mean, we have three days.

Charli, I respect your initiative
and your enterprise...

We are wasting our time.

Okay. Maybe you guys are right.

Maybe I have totally,
completely lost my mind, but...

No, you know what? Look...

I could help you make your clothes
and when Fillitti gets here...

I could convince him to shoot your stuff.

It's out there, but sometimes the best
ideas are the most unconventional.

Let's put to use
what we learned this summer.

Okay. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves.

Me, too.

I guess I can reschedule my flight.

Good. Because you don't want
to miss this.

Ryan, what are you doing here?
Working.

You?

Yeah.

Okay. We're going to produce our own
fashion line using Charli's designs.

Don't you want to know why?

Because the real clothes were stolen
and you got fired.

Ryan, the evidence.
Yeah.

Signor Tortoni has been sabotaging
Mr. Hammond for years.

He set you up for the fall
and he stole the clothes.

With Mr. Hammond jetting around
the world, Tortoni's had the opportunity.

Something you don't want to give
a jealous, corrupt man.

He wants to embarrass Uncle D.
In front of the fashion world.

I won't let that happen.

When do we bust Tortoni?
No, we'll leave that for Mr. Hammond.

And the photo shoot?
What photo shoot?

Well, my sketches
are going to become reality.

I say we move ahead.

You heard the lady. Let's quit
goofing around and get back to work.

What are you doing here?

Working, Uncle D.
For Hammond International.

Come on, guys!
Everybody get up. We got to go.

We got a photo shoot to take care of.
Come on, guys.

I've created a workaholic.

I guess you found Plan C.

Thank you.

Mr. Hammond,
we were just working on a project.

Charli, your...

Your designs are exquisite.

Thank you.

Sir, you knew about Tortoni.

For several years.

He's been doing a few shady things.
Small stuff.

But unfortunately I have this loyalty thing.

He wants to be you, Mr. Hammond.

You still loyal to Tortoni?

No. Not anymore.

Let's take him down.
We will, but timing is everything.

Okay, team, let's get back to work.
There you go.

This is big-time fun.
Better than your toys?

Yeah. Thanks for helping me
get it together.

My team did good. Very good.

Derek, I'm so glad you called.
The shoot looks terrific, no?

As you know, such an unfortunate thing
happened with the clothes. They vanished.

In the heat of the moment,
I blamed the kids.

But it was no one's fault, no?

Summer interns, look,
I am so sorry about my overreaction.

I want to rehire all of you and give
everyone a special summer-ending bonus.

Enrico, stop.

I know what you did.
Me, Derek?

What?

Look. Twelve years of living
in your shadow.

You got the glory and the girl.

And I... I got...
A lot.

And then you got greedy.

You're not going to fire me?

No.

I'm having you arrested.

Look, you know it's not my way
to do it in public.

They're waiting for you
at the police station.

I've arranged a car to take you there.

Ciao!
Arrivederci!

The coffee in prison is instant!

So, Derek, what about
New York next summer?

I have a philosophy.
You never break up a winning team.

I want all of you with me
in New York next summer.

You, I want for life.

So, you coming to New York?
On business.

I'll check out the pizza and the pasta.
Get some ideas.

Leila, you know what they say,
"When in Rome..."

Ryan, it's a nice cliché, but a hug will do.

Your magazine promotes
your fashions and your...

And you push
your magazine and musics...

Musics!

Well, you know. What's her name?

He wants to be you, Mr. Hammond, cut.

And I want you all to come next...

And I want you all to come with me
next summer. And I want...

You know, 55 Romans...
Sorry, 55,000 Romans...

Okay, I'll say it again.

Men and some women... I am sorry.

What are we doing?

Well, this gelato will be 10 times better.
Trust me.

Senta, quanto dura ancora, scusi?
Eh, io c'ho da lavora'.

Sir, it's... Natan's phone.

I don't usually care for this stuff,
but for my interns...

I will be a sacrificial...

Sorry!

You are so Americana.

We need you, man. You need...

You're doing great. Follow me.
Okay.

I don't know.

We'll be fine.

And maybe
we'll even meet Giorgio Armani.

Hammond's seven "C's".
I remember them well.

Buongiorno, signor Tortoni.

I was just delivering your mail.
That was really bad, I should do it again.

Buongiorno, Satorni, what?

Go for it.

Sort of obnoxious and kind of...

arrogant.

Sorry, I will do it again.

Go for it.

Sorry, I just lost all my lines.

Concentrate on doing things right
and you'll do them right.

Easy for you to say.

Maybe you work at customs at the airport.

Mr. Tortoni, I'll let you be the judge.

Perfetto.

This is when... About two years ago.

Hammond did...

We'll do that again.

Press release...

Mi dispiace.

I forgot my line.

English

I'm having you arrested.

Look, you know it's not my way
to do it in public.

They're waiting for you
at the police station.

I've arranged a car to take you there.

We pulled it off, Derek.

To perfection.

Pulled what off?

This clothes-stealing incident was a hoax
to see how you'd react.

Gotcha.

Wait. So this whole thing was a test?

Yes, it was.

And how'd we do?

I would give you an A+.

And I want you all to come with me
and Jami...

to New York next summer.

We're not interested.

What?
You're not?

Gotcha!

Yeah, you got us!

When in Rome...

We're shooting the opening to the movie.

And action!

I'm so tired I could stay here all day.

Our movie is about...

Our characters, Charli and Leila,
go to Rome...

to be in this intern program.

And we mess up.

We do some great things.

We're along with four other interns.

We just basically have fun.

My character is very excited to be here.

Her name's Leila and she's very excited
to go to Rome.

Mail call!

She's really into the whole fashion thing.

Mail call!

I'm doing tricks now.

Oh, no!

You don't drop it.

What happened?
I almost fell.

My character in the movie is Charli.

She's always sketching.
Her passion is designing clothes.

She kinda gets a really big crush on Paolo.

I met Micky, but I can't say his name right,
Michelangelo.

My name in reality is Michelangelo,
and in the movie I'm going to be Paolo.

I am Paolo.
I'm impressed.

He was very sweet, very nice.

The character is going to be
a beautiful character...

according to me,
because I'm gonna be a very quiet person.

He's Italian
and he's trying to speak English.

It's funny when he doesn't know how
to say the words because he gets hyper.

In my life,
I'm a little bit stressed about all this.

He works on a "serial."
That's what they call soap operas.

Right. Just this.

This scene is about...

We run into each other and we first meet.

Then we introduce ourselves.

Action.

I forgot my line.

He takes me and shows me around Rome.

He teaches me how to make pizza.

I'm making pizza!

And then, to do a pizza toss
you put your hand like this.

Yo! You got it, girlfriend!

You need some flour?

She loves me.
I love him.

This is llenia, and she plays Dari.
Hi!

And this is Valentina, and she plays Heidi.

I am a little bit crazy
because I put toothpaste on my hair.

I'm so crazy.

This is Daria.
Ciao.

I'm very selfish and...

Mean.
...mean.

You caused the CD mess!

That's not what Tortoni thinks.

It is a great school for my English
and for my work.

And I like it.

I want to improve my English every day...

and this is a very good way.

I like you and your sister...

because you don't act like stars.

You are more simple, more friendly.

Yes! Because you are so beautiful,
so good.

Thank you!

I'm here with Derek,
and he plays Ryan, my love interest.

Not so love.
Not so love. Yeah.

Ryan is an arrogant, sort of obnoxious...

bad boy from New York.

Are you crazy?

I didn't expect to see you.
There's not usually people around.

We're on the beach...

and it's not beach weather.

Are my lips purple yet?

And he meets Ashley, who is Leila.

I'm really into her
and she's not into me, unfortunately.

This was my first on-screen kiss.

It was very nerve-wracking, actually,
because it's with Ashley Olsen.

Please.

I'm with my friend Archie. He plays Nobu.

Have you had a chance
to do any sightseeing?

Oh, yeah.
What's your favorite?

My favorite?

I don't know. I've seen a lot of ruins.

There's no shortage of ruins in Rome.

Every street corner has a ruin.

My favorite sight in Rome so far...

is probably the Spanish Steps.

These are the Spanish Steps.
Completed in 1726.

The original Stairmaster!

So far we've seen the Trevi Fountain,
the Coliseum...

The Spanish Steps.
...the Spanish Steps.

The Pantheon.

We're by the Trevi Fountain.

We're doing a scene where we're
really bummed because we were just fired.

And then Mr. Hammond shows up.

We messed up, Mr. Hammond. I'm sorry.

This is the Coliseum.

It's about 2,000 years old.

Gladiators would go in there and fight
against each other, or lions and tigers.

And this is the Coliseum,
built 2,000 years ago.

You know, 55 Romans...
Sorry, 55,000 Romans...

I made a mistake!

I've got to concentrate.

55,000 Romans. 55,000 Romans.
55,000 Romans would fill this place.

It's fun to work with the Italian cast
because there's a language barrier.

You're going back and forth
on what each other means...

and we mix up some words.

Today is a beautiful day.
Right.

Say it.

I've learned a lot of good words, too.
Like ciao.

I love you.

Do you love me?

I've been told that a lot, which means,
"Let's go!"

If I had to speak Italian?
I can't even say "grazie" right.

We got to learn some of the hand signals
that the Italians use.

This means "you're a liar."
Like Pinocchio, your nose is growing.

What does this mean?
"Very good."

It's an Italian thing.

She's a great dancer and a great singer.

The filming is a lot of fun here
because you can't understand anybody.

When you're trying to communicate
with the cast or the crew...

you know little words, so it's fun
trying to put sentences together.

It's fun hearing them
try to understand what you're saying...

and then answer to something
that you didn't say...

something you didn't even
come close to asking.

Tomorrow is a new day,
so we're not gonna worry about...

Do we get to spend it together?
Certamente.

The crew and the cast
has just been amazing to work with.

We're so lucky. Everyone is just so nice
and very accommodating.

Ready?

Smile, everybody!

When in Rome, eat a lot of food.

We've been eating
a lot of pasta, predictably.

Bread.
Bread and cheeses.

The pizza is very different.

The pizza is actually like a sandwich
with whatever in between.

It's not really what our pizza is
back in the U.S.

This is me, what I'm going to look like
when I go back to L.A.

You like that?
Love it.

I'm rehearsing "relaxing" right now.

Okay, we'll start once we...

And action!

Sir, it's just coffee.

In Roma...

coffee is a ritual.

Are they really drinking coffee?
They're drinking Coca-Cola.

They put the Coke in the coffee cups
because they don't want to give us coffee.

It's hot. It's too much to deal with.

Coke looks the same.

And if we have espresso, then we're
going to be bouncing off the walls.

I think that today's going to be a good day.

It's going to be tight because
we've got a lot of scenes together...

and the other guys aren't doing anything.

Coca-Cola is good.

I had two.

It's not healthy because you get hyper.
How much did you have?

Thanks for coming.
We had a blast showing you around.

Ciao!
Ciao!
