I can't believe you talked me into this.

Now, you're sure,
like, all our gear...

And everything's on the boat?

Relax. I've taken
care of everything...

All right?

I know, I know,
I'm sure it'll be good.

You're not gonna see
any of these guys...

Don't worry about it.

This is as close as
you're gonna get.

I'll take your word for it.

Take my word for it.

This is my worst nightmare,
you know that?

I mean, what part,
are you nervous?

No. No,
I'm not nervous.

Oh, that's it.

Nervous about spending
the night with Ashley...

Would you shut up?

Well, look, you're
the college athlete, but...

You're afraid of a girl.

Shut up.

Or you're swimming
with the fishies.

Yeah, I'm
really scared.

Well, you should be.

You know, I get it.

This isn't just a girl.
This is a babe.

This is an Irish babe.

And did I mention rich?

Really rich?

Heir to the McDougal
Industries rich?

Are you through?

No, I also hear that she's bad.

She's really, really bad!

Very bad.

Lance! No, dude, no.

Look, I'm not gonna put
you wrong here,

I'm not putting you wrong.

These are the glory days.

Yeah, you keep telling me that.

So, there's nothing to worry about.

Is there?

Which one is it?

Hey!

Hey!

How you doin'?

You know, yeah.

What you got
down there?

Uh, we got my room down here.

Really? I thought there were
only 3 rooms on this boat.

Well, there were originally,

But, this is kind of
a secret compartment,

Made it my own.

Secret.
Yeah.

Hey, baby!
Hey!

Hi, I'm Lance.

Hey, Ashley.

Nice to meet you.

You, too.

You're not gonna
kiss me, are you?

I suppose that'd kill you. No.

Good answer.

Thanks.

Hmm, you two, let's go
meet the captain.

Oh, my God,
you gotta be kidding me.

This is not what we paid for.

Nice boat.

Yeah, it looks a little different
than in the brochure.

You think?

<i>Well, welcome to
my boat, the Interficio.</i>

It's a great day for sailing.

Glad you all could make it here.

You must be Kate.

Ashley.

Ashley, nice to meet you.

And you must be?

Ashley.
What?

Just kidding! I'm Kate.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, Kate.

And you guys, who are you?

So, I'm Tom, and this is Lance.

Hey, how are you?

Nice to meet you. I'm the captain.
You can call me Captain.

Do you take a check?

For the humor, yeah,
for the vacation, no.

Yeah, I tried that.
But paying for it...

with a check doesn't work.

Ok, um. And you are?

Oh, I'm Derek.

Derek?
Yeah.

Do you work on the boat?

No, he's a passenger, hop on.

Oh, wait a minute, time out.

Derek, don't hop on board.
Could you just...

Could you get off, 'cause...

Captain, no disrespect...

But, um...
Actually, a little disrespect.

We just paid good money
for it to be...

four people
on the boat, remember?

Uh, yeah, we do
have a problem then...

because the captain
does like to navigate.

Seriously, though,
I wasn't aware...

anyone else was going
to be aboard, captain.

Who are you?

I'm Joel, the navigator
and first mate.

Where's the second mate?

Power struggle, thrown overboard.
I won.

Comforting.

What time do we
shove off, Captain?

Five minutes.
Disconnect the shore power line.

Thank you, Captain.
You bet.

Who are all you people?

Now I know this was a bad idea.

Hey, Captain, where are
we all going to sleep?

Hey, Derek, why do you care?
You're not staying.

Oh, yes, I am.

No, you're not.

Yes, I am.
No, you're not.

Oh, God.
Come on, boys, cut it out.

You bunk down at
the end of the hall.

Last door.

I actually worked to
pay for this cruise.

I don't care.

Hey, look, guys, we
don't want any problems.

All right.
Right. No problem!

Whatever!

Ash...

Let's go see what
we're paying for.

Come on.
Kate...

Come on! Let's see it.
Kate!

Well, I guess there's
only two rooms left...

So it looks like...

Girls on one side,
boys on the other.

Traditional.

Kate.

Hey, where do you
think Joel sleeps?

I don't know.

Where do you think
Derek's gonna sleep?

Ooh, good answer.

Come on. Let's check out our room.

So, Captain, you ever catch
any big fish out of this boat?

You bet. Big'uns.
Yeah?

It's all about the bait.

Captain.

Welcome aboard.

Everything's gonna be cool.

No problems, OK?

All right. No problems, whatever.

Who does that
captain think he was?

Oh, I don't know. The captain?

Don't cross me, Lance.

Where did that come from?
"Don't cross you"?

May I remind you this is
all your brilliant idea?

And who says cross anymore?

Shut up.

Yeah.

I must be in the wrong room.

Yeah, you got that right.

Actually, no, wait.

Why don't you stay,
please, and I'll leave.

And actually,
do you need a roommate...

back on the mainland?

Look, I'm sorry, we're
having a little bit...

of a miscommunication here.

Which is ironic,
because his girlfriend...

The Education major,
she's been working with him.

Yeah, that's it. Come here.

Uh, look, maybe I can...
Find another room.

The girls are right
across the hall.

You two keep this room.

Yeah, all right, truce.

What?
What?

Great, nice job, you dork.

What are they doing out there?

I don't know. Boys will be boys.

Why don't you
get them all up on deck?

All hands on deck!
Captain's orders.

<i>Informational meeting.
Welcome to the Interficio...</i>

You're about to embark on
the trip of a lifetime.

We're gonna go to
the best diving and fishing...

and partying spots.

Tonight, we're going to
a place called Pirate Island.

Life jackets, first aid
equipment stored overhead...

in the compartment.

Lf, for any reason,
we start taking on water...

All seats become
a flotation device, right?

No, you drown.

OK, get ready to set sail.

OK.

Gentlemen and ladies,
the bar is open.

Whoo! Let's go.

Now, we're gonna be on
Pirate Island tonight...

and I'll be using the dinghy
to ferry everybody back and forth.

I can only take two at a time.

Here you go, babe.

Oh, thank you.

So...

is this where we sit around...

and tell horror stories
by the campfire?

Captain, why do they
call this Pirate Island?

I don't know. Pirates?

# I barely had hair
and I killed only three #

# Filigo, filigo, filigo-ree #

# But old Mr. Teach
took a liking to me #

# Filigo, filigo, filigo-ree #

# The first day out,
he gunpowdered my rum #

# Filigo, filigo, filigo-rum #

# Me timbers did shiver,
me head, it did hum #

# Filigo, filigo, filigo-rum #

# He taught me to kill
while feeling much glee #

# Filigo... ho ho!
Filigo, filigo-ree #

# A man can say little once he's dead #

# Filigo, filigo, filigo-red #

# As we walk hand in hand
with Mr. Death on the beach #

# "Forever the Black Jack!"
Cries old Mr. Teach #

Now you are really scaring me.

It's just an old pirate's tale, Ash.

True pirate, he sings it
just before or after...

he kills somebody.

Basically, it means...

you're next.

Well, now we know why
there's no more old pirates, huh?

The songs killed 'em.

Actually, there are.

Oh, please.

No, really.

There are renegade bandits
that consider themselves...

modern-day pirates.

They kill, steal.

They prey on boats
throughout these waters.

And we're dead in the center.

Pirate's alley.

Are you serious?

Some even dress up
and fly the Black Jack.

Black Jack?

Skull and crossbones.

Modern pirates?

Captain?

It's true.

And...

We're camped on their island.

You're all nuts.

Yeah.

New game, new rules.

What are you scared of?

What are you really scared of?

OK.

Death.

Death by...

Murder.

Next.

Throat cut.

Gruesome...

but I like it.

Ok, Gruesome. You're next.

My, uh, big fear is...

drowning.

What a dork.

OK, Hotshot.

I'm the director of this play.

You're next.

Oh, that's easy.
Nothing scares me.

Come on, Tom.

OK...

Suffocation.

Lack of O2.

Captain?

What scares me...

I know it's weird,
because I'm a sailor...

but... hooks. Hooks.

Next?

As you know by now...

I'm the navigator and first mate.

I love the sea...

though I have to say
I am in awe of it.

What scares me...

Being lost in it.

That's why I'm the navigator.

Next.

Oh, well, I guess that leaves me.

I love the water. I always have.

The only thing that's
ever really scared me is sharks.

I was a kid,
and I was out fishing...

and I had this
little fish on the line...

and he's thrashing
all around, and...

Then I see it.
This fin pops up.

And he's headed
straight for my fish...

and I was helpless to do
anything about it.

Anyway, from now on out...

I keep this shark
on my rear view mirror...

to remind me to face my fears.

That's a sad story.

Lance?

Your turn.
We need more beer.

OK.

You OK?

No.

Lance?

Hey, you're bleeding.

What did you do?

Yeah.

Oh, shoot!

I stepped on something.

Come over here.

Careful.

What was it?

Here, take a seat.
Let's have a look.

Easy...

Oh...

God, that hurts.

Oh, man!

Oh, God, what did you step on?

What happened?

I don't know, man.
I stepped on something.

Oh, that looks bad.

Pour some rum on it.

I can't believe this.

That's enough.

Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Oh, God.

I think that might
need stitches, man.

No, I don't think so. It'll be OK.

Just keep it wrapped
and apply pressure.

Did you see how deep that was?

I mean, that was really deep.

Wonder what in the world
he cut himself on.

It's not like a shell...

Is he ok?

No. Y'all, we should go.

'Cause it hurts.

We should go.
Everybody, come on. Let's go.

What did I step...
What the hell did I step...

Did I step on?

Well, Lance...

You make your friends fast, huh?

Who would leave this like that?

What, you think somebody
did that on purpose?

You have another suggestion?

No.

Good question.

Let's get him back to the boat.

I'll get the first aid kit.

Bring the dinghy.

So it begins.

We could turn back.

Nah, kids want to go on.

You should have told me
about Derek.

I needed the money.

Besides, I am the captain.

Then act like one.

We got a bleeder here.

That feel any better?

Yeah. Yeah, that's good, man.

Do you want to use my cell phone?

No, no, I mean,
I think I'm gonna be OK.

I mean, you're sure
you don't want...

to go back to shore for help,
or call, or something?

No. You know, it seems
to have stopped bleeding...

and we're all on vacation, so...

Some vacation.

Seriously. I mean,
if we go back to shore...

we can always check and make sure...
our cars are OK...

Ash...

I think it's gonna be ok.

Hey, lovebirds...

He just cut his foot, you know?

On a knife.

Yeah, but he's gonna be fine.

Fine? I mean, doesn't he need
a Tetanus shot, or something?

Oh, that's just if the blade was rusty...

but that knife was clean, right?

It was all right.

Yeah, but don't you
think that's weird?

A clean blade in the middle of
a deserted island?

It was probably
left there by a fisherman.

A fisherman?

Guys, this is a little spot
I like to call Snorkel Bay.

We're directly above
a series of reefs...

that go down into deep water.

You get snagged down there,
nobody's coming after you.

That's reassuring.

You're each gonna get
a snorkel and a mask.

Stay up close to the boat,
but away from the hull,

So the waves don't
crash you up against it.

We don't want another accident,
do we, Lance?

Right.

Right. OK.

So are there sharks down there?

Well, that's a Lance question.

No, well, this is their home,
you know?

As long as we're not leaving a trail
of blood in the water...

we should be fine.

Speaking of which,
you still bleeding?

No. No, not really.

Maybe you better
sit this one out, anyway.

OK.

Everybody into the water.
Have fun.

Stay away from the propeller,
it's an ugly way to die.

Kate, Kate.

I dropped my mask.

You find it, I'll make it
worth your while.

I'll be right back.

Don't bother.
You heard the captain.

It's too deep there.

You're an amateur.

Your boyfriend's gonna
get himself killed.

Boys will be boys.

Yeah.

See ya.

On the edge, man. On the edge.

Over the edge, pal.

What? I didn't see you going in.

No, I didn't want to.
It's just a stupid mask.

What's the matter, Derek,
you afraid to drown?

Quite frankly...

Yeah.

That's not the point.

What is the point?

Kate!

That was a rush.

I'm your knight
in shining armor, baby.

It's a wonder you didn't
sink to the bottom.

Yeah, I thought hot air rises
though, doesn't it?

Hey, you want
to throw me overboard?

That's OK. I'll pass.

Is there a problem here, boys?

I'm good.

Hey, guys.

Hey! How you doing, Lance?

Hey, Lance.

Hey, man, how are you?

You know, good. What's going on?

Just getting back to work.

OK.

Good-bye. Yeah, yeah.

Hi.

Hey.

So what was that all about?

Oh, nothing. I was just
figuring out some stuff.

My dad likes to know
exactly where I am at all times.

Really? That sounds like fun.

Yeah. I don't always
like to tell him.

Welcome to my world.

I'm glad to be here.

So what is this Party Island?

You didn't read the brochure?

There was a brochure?
Yes.

I mean, besides this boat brochure?

Yeah.

No, all I was told was
that it would cost this much...

and it was gonna be lots of fun.

Kate, where's the fun?

Party Island is where
all the boats go for this huge party.

It'll be all good, I'm telling you.

Great.

Relax.

Lance likes you.

No, he doesn't.

Oh, yes, he...

Oh, my God!

Tom!

Tom!

You scared the living
daylights out of me.

I'm here to claim
the sexual prize.

Uh, great, Kate.

I'm sorry, were you two
talking about me?

I interrupt?

You know, why don't you just
go throw Kate's mask overboard...

and then just go dive for it again?

Well, I could throw you overboard.
How about that?

Stop it, Honey.

You'll get your prize. Be nice.

Sooner morning comes, the better.

You got that right.

Watch our back, Captain.

I'll watch yours, you watch mine.

It's a deal.

Deal.

I'll take first watch.

I need coffee.

Ash, you asleep?

Yes.

No. What?

I'm going out.

Out where?

On a date.

Kate...

We're in the middle of the ocean.

Besides, Tom was already here.

It's not Tom.

Joel...

Where are you?

Are you playing games?

I like games.
Little hide-and-seek?

Joel!

I'll find you.

Joel!

We're right in the middle of nowhere.

Hello?

Hold on.

OK. Now you can...

Is Joel in here?

No, Joel's not in here.

He should be up on deck.

I... I checked,
and he's not up there.

Well, he's probably on deck.

I mean, he's not here.

He can't have taken a walk.
We're on a boat.

I looked.
You check the helm?

Yes. I didn't see him.

What in the world's
going on here?

You tell me.

Get everybody on deck, now.

But what about J...

Now!

Guys, get up!

We're sleeping!

I know! Get up.

Captain wants everyone
on deck, now!

Ash? Ash...

Get up, babe.

Ash, come on. Just come on.

We have to go up on deck.

Hurry.

I'm going, I'm going.

Just go.

What did you do to my boat?

Your boat? How about
what you did to Joel?

OK, what did you do to Joel?

What are you talking about?

My navigation equipment
is gone...

My navigator's missing.
The dinghy's gone!

Hey, Mr. Holmes,
doesn't it make sense...

that if he did this, then he left?

Not Joel.

Not Joel? Who?

Well, somebody who understands
how to work this equipment.

Derek it is, then.

Wrong.

I don't understand
anything above water.

Come on, is there someone
we can call?

What's going on?

You can use my cell phone.

Yeah, if someone would
bring us the keys.

Battery's dead.

I tried it yesterday.

I have a spare, but thanks, Kate.

What I'm trying to say
is whoever did this...

wants us to stay here.

OK, so we stay.
I mean, what's the big deal?

It's not like he took the food, right?

No, but we're stuck here
until somebody finds us...

or we get some keys.
Now, listen.

First light tomorrow, we get up
we search for clues...

We try to find out
what else is missing.

And for the love of God,
please try not to disappear.

Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.

<i>Um, remember
what Interficio means?</i>

Oh, yeah? To disappear?

No.

Oh, my God. Is that blood?

I wonder if it's Joel's.

Great.

<i>So, like I was saying, Interficio?</i>

It means "murder. "

I don't like this.

Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

Red sky at morn, sailors be warned.

Kate...

What if it was one of us?

Psychology...

I'm serious.

What? The loss of the equipment,
or the disappearance of Joel?

Both.

Ok. Who?

That weirdo captain!

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

He would not do this
to his own stuff.

I don't know! He might!
I mean, to throw off suspicion.

He did name his boat...

It's so weird.

No. That's a coincidence. It's...

Derek!

Motivation?

To get even with the captain.

And he is working class.

Good point. Good point.

And then again,
you are working class.

What about Tom?

Why?

Jealousy.

He always wants to be
the brains of the operation.

That's good.

Lance.

No way!

Why? You pick my boyfriend,
I pick yours.

He is not my boyfriend.

OK.

But he still could have done it.

No. No way.

I mean, he has no motivation.

You.

You.

Motivation?

The black widow.

She mates, then she kills.

That's good.

You.

Motivation?

Daddy's little girl,

Looking for her own identity.

Money doesn't buy everything.

That's good.

Or, you know, it just
could have been Joel.

Good point.

What are we thinking?

Where is he, anyway?

Creepy.

# My timbers did shiver #

# My head it did hum #

# Filago, filago #

# Filago-rum #

I can't believe
we're stuck here again...

another night, with no wind.

It's not so bad.

Oh, well, somebody will find us.

I'm leaving in a minute.

Where are you going?

To kill someone.

Yeah, well,
when will you be back?

Before you wake up.

You promise?

Promise.

Captain?

Captain?

Captain?

Not again.

Kate?

Kate?

Hey!

Somebody help me!

No!

Hey! Anybody!

Oh, my God!
There's a shark!

Hey! Hey, there's a shark!

Help me!

Please! Somebody help me!

Help!

Couldn't sleep?

Nope.

Is Lance asleep?

You tell me.

What does that mean?

Well...

It means that you seem to know...

everything about everybody's actions
and whereabouts.

So, you tell me.
Is Lance in his room or isn't he?

No. No, he's not in his room.

Hey.

What are you two doing here?

I'm making Derek a sandwich.

OK?

Why?

I just figured you'd be in bed.

Nah, he's not my type.

Funny guy.

Why aren't you in bed?

I couldn't sleep.

I mean, with Joel missing and all.

OK.

I'm gonna go back to bed.

You want me to join you?

No, no.

I'll be fine by myself, thanks.

Besides, what would Kate say?

Nothing.

I'll pass anyway.

She sure seemed jumpy.

Yeah. I wonder why.

I'm going back to the cabin.

I think I'll stay here a little longer.

Suit yourself.

Have you seen
the captain tonight?

Have you?

Would you stop it with the games?

OK.

All right...

Is the captain missing?

He was in his cabin
at the front of the boat.

Oh, so, he's not missing then?

Look, can I ask you a question?

Shoot.

Ever since I got here...

You've had some kind
of problem with me.

Why is that?

What did I do to you?

It's not what you did to me.

It's Kate.

She wanted you. I mean...

From the minute she saw you,
I saw it in her eyes.

I couldn't let her do it.

Do what? Isn't that her choice?

Well, everybody has their choices.

Let me ask you something.

Do you like Kate?

OK.

# Filigo, filigo-ree #

Ashley.

Silly girl.

Cute...

but silly.

Not yet.

Captain, we have visitors.

Come on!

Where are you, Kate?

Oh, my God! No!

Oh, my God!

No, no!

God, no!

Oh, God!

Oh, God!

Oh, God!

Why did he capture you?

You OK?

Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

Everybody's gone.
Everybody's gone.

Tom's dead.

OK.

So, then, how about the bad news?

This boat is sinking.

You think?

OK.

OK, the engine's on.

That explains the hum
and probably the water.

Who had the keys?

Maybe Joel still has them.

So, what are we gonna do?

Well, we're gonna find out
who started the engine...

And then why we're sinking.

Come on. Get a life jacket.

Wait, wait, wait.

Did you actually
see Joel hit you?

No. He hit me on the back of...

Somebody hit me
on the back of the head.

I blacked out.

When I woke up, I...
nobody was around...

OK, so, there could still be
somebody else on this boat?

Yeah. Probably.

That's why they left Tom
hanging there to scare us.

Well, it worked!

Yeah, it did.

I can't do this.

No!

God, no more!

I can't do this anymore!

Easy with the knife.

If they're going to take us down...

I'm not going down without a fight.

That a girl.

Two heads are better than one.

And I got a knife.

Yeah, you do.

Me, too.

He's dead, Captain.

I'll be the judge of that.

Here.
Yeah, he's dead, all right.

Careful.

Yeah, he is dead.

Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

He's got no pulse.

Nice work.

You sure you didn't do this?

No, I didn't.

There's nobody down here.

Well, maybe they're all up top.

Where do you think they are?

I'm hoping they're up above.

No! After you.

Ladies first. Go ahead.

Gentlemen.
That's all right.

Come on, I'll go first.

I'm right behind you.

Really.
Yeah.

Well, watch your back.

And you watch your front.

The master key.

Surprise, surprise.

Who had that key?

Joel.

Super.

At least we know
we got a great first mate.

Well, thank you very much.

Can you explain to me again
how the boat is sinking?

Well, best bet is the water intake.

Water's going into the engine room
instead of the water tank.

Then the pump ain't working.

If we shut down the engine,
that should take care of it.

Should?

Yeah, should.
At least, it can cut the exhaust.

That smokes up the whole boat.

Don't you need to know something
about boats or whatever...

in order to do something like that?

Or engines, in general, yeah.

Let me guess. Joel.

Yeah. Joel.

You must really have done
something to piss him off, huh?

Look, I'm sorry about Tom.

Whatever...

He was a jerk anyway, you know?

Well, if he was a jerk, then I guess...

we can leave him
hanging there, huh?

Look, right now,
I'm really just way more concerned...

about Kate and Lance and Derek.

Not to mention you and I, you know?

Well, at least we haven't
found their bodies.

That's because they're alive.
They are.

OK, we would have
found them if they weren't.

Just like I found you.

Where'd they go?
I don't know, but they're alive!

OK. They're alive.

They're just
on some other boat somewhere.

What other boat?
I don't know. Some other boat.

There are no other boats!

What's that?

I have no idea.

Should, uh, should we
signal 'em or something?

With what? There's nothing left.
Everything's missing.

They're gone, anyway.

Yeah, but that's a good sign.
That gives us hope, right?

I mean, they're going
to come back probably.

The better question is...

if these are the folks
that are doing this...

we don't really want 'em
to come back, do we?

Wait a minute. I thought we decided
that Joel did this.

No, I don't think so.
It doesn't feel right.

It doesn't feel right?

Joel didn't do this.

OK, well, then, who did,
Captain, because...

it's only you and I left.

Oh, come on.

This isn't some sort of...

sick game for you, is it?

What are you talking about?

Oh, my God.
Just stay away from me.

Ashley...

I got it!
That's it! You were gonna...

Becoming a psycho!

What'd you do with them?

Ashley, you don't even know
what you're talking about...

For God's sake.
Just put the knife down.

Stay away from me.

Think, OK? Think.

I was tied up in the shower.
How... who started the engine?

Yeah, but before that.
You could have planned all this...

and tied yourself up.

You are a sailor.
You know how to tie knots.

You're not even making any sense.

Then explain something to me, OK?

You yourself said that we
were the last two people on this boat.

I know I didn't do it.

How do I know that?

Seriously.

Oh, please.

No, no. Really.
How do I know that?

How do I know
this isn't some prank...

that you guys figured out...

and they're on a boat somewhere
laughing and Tom's alive?

You're sick.

Am I?

You did this.

No.

No, I didn't. But I'm beginning
to think you did.

OK.

You don't trust me.

Fair enough.

Right now, I sure don't trust you.

True.

We've both got knives.

That's also true.

Yeah.

I got a proposal.

OK, fine. I'll listen.

But just don't come
any closer to me, OK?

Fine.

You stay on one part
of the boat...

I'll stay on the other part
of the boat.

We'll stay topside.

As long as we're
not near each other...

we can't hurt each other, OK?

And we'll just wait here.

We'll sit tight
until the authorities come...

then they'll work it out.

OK, that's not...

That's not bad.

Which side of the boat
do you want?

Well, whichever side you don't take.

I'm not moving.

Fine. I'll head for the stern.

Fine.

Put the knife down.

When you get to the stern.

Fine.
Fine!

Storm's comin'.

No!

Don't touch her!

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Jesus.

Who's there?

Fine. Find them, Kate.

Dang it!

He started the engines.

Joel?

Joel?

If this is you, I've got a knife
and I will kill you!

Come and get me.

And if it isn't, whoever it is,
you're gonna die, too.

Come out, come out
wherever you are.

God! Where are you?!

OK, I am starting to get angry!

Kate!

Tom!

Oh, my God! Tom!

It's OK. It's OK.

Oh, my God! They're all dead!
I'm here. I'm here.

Everybody is dead.

Oh, God!

Look at me. Hey!

# You helped me to kill #

# By feeling much glee #

# Filigo, filigo filigo-ree #

# And a man can say little #

# When he is dead #

# Filigo, filigo, filigo-red #

# As we walk hand-in-hand #

# With old death on the beach #

# Forever the Black Jack
cries old Mr. Teach #

You're dead, you're dead!

I saw you! You were hanging!
And every...

I know. I know.

It's realism, baby. Did you like it?
Did you like it?

But who I can't believe...

I can't believe that this guy
missed my pulse.

I mean, what are
the chances of that?

I thought he had me.
It's just dumb luck.

You should always,
always go for the neck.

Thank you, by the way,
for giving him my arm.

Stay away from me!

Hey. Hey.

Did you work it out, huh?

I mean, it's priceless.

When you called the captain
a psycho. I loved that!

Come on.

The sailor's knots, the hanging...

It was the right idea,
but the wrong guy.

And then, when you
went back to the cabin...

and I wasn't there anymore?

Come on! You're smarter than this.

I have a knife!

So do I.

Come on, come on.

Can we stop going in circles here?

No!

OK. OK.
I'm gonna sit right here...

and I'm gonna wait for you
to come to me.

It won't happen.

We're the only people on this boat.

What did you do with them?

Do you really want to know?

I really do.

OK.

Well, first, there was Joel.

Oh, my God. The campfire.

See, now, you're getting smart.

I know the rest.

I buried this knife at the island, too.

You remember?

You're sick!

That your psychological diagnosis?

My psychological diagnosis...

is Antisocial Personality Disorder.

Your motivation...

is that you lie and you cheat...

and you steal...

and you even murder...

without feeling any remorse.

I should know.

And now, don't get any bright ideas
about us teaming up together.

Because...

Because another factor
of this disorder...

is that we work alone.

And now, I get to kill you...

without feeling bad about it.

You get to try.

You remember how
I didn't want to die?

Suffocation?

Right. And how about you?

Throat cut.

I have a knife. Coincidence?

Why didn't you
just stab me in the back...

when you had the chance, huh?

You're the psychologist.
You tell me.

Because you're twisted.

Because you needed
to tell somebody.

Partially.

You know, why don't you
just keep thinking about it...

While I run
through the game, huh?

Is that what you call this, a game?

Well, what would you call it?

Murder.

OK. Murder.

You know, for Kate's murder...

She just said murder, so...

I used this knife.

And Lance...

He's afraid of sharks.

Oh, sick bastard.

What is it you used to say to Kate?

No lectures.

And how would you know that?

She used to tell me stuff.

She was my girlfriend, remember?

She never liked you!

Well, she sure did piss me off!

You have a proven tendency
to want violence.

Yeah, well, you
still never told me...

why you did this.

You know, Derek...

He was afraid of drowning.

The captain, hooked.

But that would never kill him.

You know, I always thought...

The captain should go down
with the boat.

What do you think?

Aw, to hell with it.

I'm not superstitious.

Why did you do this, Tom?

You know what?

That's enough talk.

It's time for some action.

Let's rock and roll.

No!

Come over here!

Are you gonna try and drown us?

No! I'm gonna sink the boat!

Oh, yeah?

You want to die? Follow me!

Ashley? Where are you?

I'm gonna find ya.

Ashley, haven't we already
done this before?

Are you gonna be hanging
when I open this door?

I know where you are.

I know where you are!

It's a small boat, Ashley.
You can't hide.

You're right there, aren't you?

Ready? Get ready for this.

You idiot!

You just should have
checked in the closet!

It's not very smart!

You stupid girl!

Now I'm pissed!

I'm bleeding.

I'm gonna kill you!

God!

I'm gonna slit your throat, Ashley!

Come here!

The game is over!

Behind you!

How do you like
your stupid game now, Tom?

How's your shoulder feel?

So you knew you didn't
kill me, huh?

Of course not! That's not
how you wanted to die.

What this is is a game.

I am the damsel
in distress, you know?

I'm the victim, helpless.

But see, in my game...

the hunter becomes the hunted.

Yeah? But how far
is this game gonna go, huh?

You're smarter than this.

What do you mean I'm smarter?

Come on.

Are you gonna
suffocate me, Ashley?

Yes.

That's ridiculous.
We both have knives...

and I'm bigger than you
or haven't you noticed?

You'll figure it out. Or die trying.

That's really funny, Ashley.

I thought so.

Still haven't answered
my question, Tom.

Which question is that?

Why?

OK. OK.

I did it...

to see if I could get away with it,
How about that?

I see.

And what, you just love the thrill?

Yeah, yeah.

I mean, hey, haven't
you ever had the urge...

to do something insane?

How does it feel
to kill someone, Ashley?

Do you know?

How does it feel to drive a car...

right into a wall at 70 miles an hour?

Or... or jump from an 80-story building?

I was curious, and now I know.

I know, at least about the killing part.

You wanted to see what it felt like.

Yes.

You are sick!

No. No.

I'm just livin' out a fetish, that's all.

I mean, hey, how did it feel...

when you stabbed me
in the shoulder?

It was an adrenaline rush, right?

Double it, and then
you have some idea...

Of what it's like to go all the way.

Oh, yeah.

It's like a drug, Ashley.

You do it once,
you can't wait to do it again.

Just think about it.

I held their lives in my hand.

For just a minute, I was God.

It was beautiful.

Your turn.

Already?

Yeah. Tell me...

What is thing that
I keep forgetting?

I'm dying to know, Ashley.

Tell me. What is it?

Pirates, Tom.

Pirates?

Yeah, pirates.

You're gonna have to do
better than that, Ashley.

Yeah. Ever since we left port...

Why would pirates
be following us?

Ransom!

I am heir to the McDougal fortune.

I am worth a lot!

You are making this up.

Oh, am I?

Yes!

The captain was in on it.

Yeah, and Kate had it figured out.

No. No way, no way.

I don't believe you.

So I guess you didn't get away
with as much as you thought.

No. No.

Why didn't they stop me, huh?

Just as long as you didn't hurt me.

This is ridiculous.

Really?

Really!

Can we stop the game?

Sure.

I wasn't sure
you could really do it!

You were great.
You were awesome.

Thank you.
We stacked everybody up!

Thanks, baby.

Did you have to stab me?

I'm sorry. I had to
keep up my character.

Oh, you did a great job.

Of course.

What's wrong? Have a little faith.

I killed them all.
I killed them all.

For you, baby. For you.

I love you.

Kate, Lance, Derek...

I didn't even like that one.

And the captain.
Getting rid of Joel.

And now you give me
a million dollars, baby.

A million dollars in cash.

There are some things
money can't buy, Tom.

Oh, why did we
ever break up?

Well, I was never good enough
or smart enough for you, Ash.

Please!

I hired you, didn't I?

Have you ever been smothered?

With kisses, I mean.

This'll be the first time.

Tom.

Come here.

# Taught me to kill #

# Feeling much glee #

What? No! No!

God! Ashley!

Can't breathe...

What are you doing?!

Hi, Joel.

He actually believed it.

Yeah.

He thought I was actually dead?

Yep.

Fool.

Never mess with a blue blood.

We will always outsmart
and outspend you.

Right, Ash?

Right.

Your men found me waiting
on Pirate Island.

Thanks for the safe passage.

My pleasure.

Red skies at night, sailor's delight.

Red skies at morn,
sailors be warned.

Tom was easy. Natural predator.

The crew, helpless. Sitting ducks.

What some people
will do for love...

Or should I say your love?

Sorry about your boat.

<i>The Interficio
had seen better days...</i>

I'll get a new one
with my trust fund, anyway.

Hardest part,
Finding an out of work actor...

To play the captain.

I liked him.

He was good, especially
with that Pirate Island stuff.

I liked that.

Then he almost screwed
everything up with Derek...

Cheap bastard.

I'm glad Tom gave him
the hook.

So tell me...

Hmm?

Was it all worth it?

Well, what do you give a gal
that has everything?

The ability to play God.

Happy birthday.

Thank you.

Though it's not over yet.

Well, what's next?

I mean, I have nothing to gain.

On the contrary.

I sent the men
from your boat home.

Your alibi's safe with me.

No one knows
you were on the boat.

Now it's just you and me...

The way it was always
meant to be.

You want this game to continue.

Oh, Ash.

You're smarter than that.
Winner take all.

Does that scare you?

Joel?

Yeah, Ash?

Have you ever wondered
what it's like...

To slam your car into a brick wall...

going 70 miles an hour...

or to jump out an 80-story window?

No. Why do you ask?

You know, I could just
smother you with kisses.

You want to go some place private?

Private?

Yeah. You know...

Lost, so to speak.

I thought you would never ask.

Just...

don't tell anyone, OK?

OK.
