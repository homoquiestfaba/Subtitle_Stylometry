G:
For as long as l can remember,

the three of us
have always been best friends.

Even when we were babies,

me, Lonnie, and Dom shared
the same crib.

@ Dr. Seuss and Mother Goose
both did their thing @

@ But Jam Master's gettin'
loose and D.M. C. 's the king @

[ All belching ]

We were tight, like brothers.

But we all had our own dreams.

G , let me down .

Lonnie dreamed of two things.

Mmm .

First was that Rolonda loved
him as much as he loved her.

[ Yelps, growls ]

Huh?

But all she loved
was his money.

He also wanted to be
a big inventor.

My boy Dom.

He just loved the music.

[ Hip-hop music plays ]

As for me, well, l was built
to be a professional athlete.

Yeah, l was gonna be
the best bo xer

to come out of South Philly
since Rocky.

l was gonna be
the Black Stallion!

Dag , this burns!

[ Gasping ]
Oxygen .

$2 Tuesday was karate night.

ALL: Hyah !

Sometimes my cousin Randall
would chill with us.

He had a thing
for candyjacking.

l want it chilly up in here!

You now on Cha Ching's
most-wanted list.

That's why we called him
''No Good. ''

We went from boys to men
together.

And the three of us moved into
Lonnie's Uncle Virgil's house.

lt was just temporary until
we could find a better place.

You have a ride home, XiXi?

Yes, Father.

Don't be late.

Yes, Father.

Give your father kiss.

Bye, Father.

Look. We can go
in Uncle Virgil's room .

He got one of them
orthopedic beds.

Guess who.

-Alvena?
-No.

Mm .
Hold up. Ooh .

Ooh ! Rashida.

Oh , no, no.
This is Laquida.

Unh-unh-unh !
This is Tamika.

You got one more chance
to get it.

Or you won't be making it
to your next fight.

Hey, baby.

l knew it was you .
l was just having fun .

Sorry l'm late.

Had to get a ride
from my father.

Does your pops know
you came to see me?

Yes.

Come on , baby.
You know that's not cool .

Forget about my father.

l love you .

That's what matters.

@ Happy birthday to you @

Hey, Lonnie!

@ Happy birthday to you @

@ Happy birthday, dear Lonnie @

@ Happy birthday to you @

Make a wish , Lon .

l wish Rolonda was here.

Ho-londa!

Get out the way!

-Big Swoll in the house.
-You got your wish .

Can l get her
for my birthday, too?

Happy birthday, boyfriend .

Rolonda.

Don't stop.

l was beginning to think
that you weren't gonna show.

You know Ro-Ro wouldn't miss
her Lonnie's birthday party.

l knew you wouldn't let me down .

This right here is my cousin
Big Swoll .

He just got out
the penitentiary.

Hey, Big Swoll .

lt's good to meet
a member of the family.

Yeah , l'm all right, Johnny.

Happy birthday, man .

You know, Rolonda,
l was thinking that. . .

Ooh ! Cake.

That's what l want.
Some cake.

l haven't eaten
in two whole hours.

And for some reason ,
l just can't stop eating .

Ooh .
There it is.

Nia.

You looked so busy
at work today.

l'm surprised to see you here.

The studio was
really busy today.

How could l miss
one of your famous parties?

Yeah , and you're wearing
that top that l love so much .

That's 'cause l want you
to take it off.

Just a second , baby.

Go, Daddy, go.

Ooh , ooh , ooh .

That's cute.

[ Moans ]

Oh !

Mmm ! Ooh !

l'm here now.
l'm here.

Oh .

You know, l . . .

l have these feelings.

l want to take care
of you , Rolonda.

And l was thinking we could get
our own place

and maybe get married someday.

Damn , Lonnie.

That's real sweet, baby.

Nigger ain't never said no shit
like that before.

So you think maybe we could . . .

Oh . 1 0:30, boo.

@ Hey, now, my show is on @

@ Ooh, ooh, my show is on @

@ Compton 9022 1 @

DOMlNlC: We can't be cleaning up
like this.

We gotta hire ourselves a maid .

G :
What are you complaining about?

l'm the one on my hands
and knees.

l thought that was
your favorite position .

-LONNlE : Good morning , guys.
-Hey.

Hey.

What's wrong , man?

What's wrong , Lon?

l'm a year older, and l'm
still here with you two guys

at my Uncle Virgil's house.

You know what you sound like
right now, man?

Nah . What?

A bitch .

Yeah .
Seriously, Lonnie.

You don't want to mess around
with a good thing .

l mean , take a look around you .

We got the tight bachelor pad .

We could do whatever we want.
l mean , this is it.

We made it, man .

Right there, dawg .

Mm !
Ta-dow!

[ Clears throat ]

You better clean this damn mess
up before you leave.

l know that.

Whip some ass up in here.

This is it?

Getting yelled at
like schoolchildren?

further along in my life by now.

You know, have my own family.

My own place.

One of these days
you guys are gonna grow up.

You 1 2 minutes late.

l dock paycheck.

Look, Cha Ching , l know we got

And Bit-O-Honey. Milky Way.
Black licorice.

And case of Coors.

What's ''ricorrish''?

Licorice.

Licorice!

Don't play language game
with me.

You now 1 4 minutes late.

Good talk.

Dang Ling , l can't understand
a damn word your daddy say.

Great first half, kids.

BO Y: You missed five calls,
you four-eyed punk.

Rolonda! Peaches!

What are you doing here?

We need to talk.

l'm all ears.

Mama dear is gonna go wait
over there.

Remember that time
we was watching ''Compton 9022 1 ''

and Swapmisha had told Dante
that she was pregnant?

How could l forget it?

Point is, Swapmisha wasn't
the only one got knocked up.

-You mean l'm gonna be a daddy?
-lt's yours.

Just forget it, Lonnie.

'Cause l can't take care
of no baby on my income alone.

Daddy also has a job
at the Sanitation Department.

And l just got a job yesterday
at Piggy Smalls' Pizzeria.

You know my Uncle Virgil
raised me right, girl .

And l want to do the same
for our child , Ro-Ro.

l'm gonna take care
of the both of you .

You so good to me, Lonnie.

G :
Don't want to give me that, huh?

Come on .

You look whiter than usual .

LONNlE :

My life is over.

Finished .

The three of us.

Daddies.

Ain't it great?

He asking if it's all right
to still be tappin' that ass.

Oh , sure.

Feel free to get your swerve on
throughout the pregnancy.

[ Farts ]

Damn .

Don't be embarrassed , dear.

Flatulence is very normal
during pregnancy.

So let 'em rip!

Oh , cool .
[ Farts ]

Pregnant people, fool .

No!

You know, it's about time, Lon .

l got tired of you going out
like a sucker.

Yeah .
Seriously, Lonnie.

You gotta get with the program
like me.

l don't think you're getting it.

l like spending time
with Carver.

lt's the mama
l'm starting to doubt.

Lonnie, there are plenty
of women out there

that will treat you right, man .

There is this one girl , Brandy,
from the Mommy & Me class.

She's the bomb-diggity-fresh .

But l don't think she'd go
for a guy like me.

She would , man , if you took
some pointers from the pros.

You know what, Lon?

You need some game, dawg .

And some new slang .

'Cause ''the bomb-diggity-fresh''?

Where the hell did you
get that from , anyway?

Yeah , man .
You need some style.

A makeover.

Oh .

Dawg boot camp.

Mm .
Ta-dow.

Oh , no, no.
You're gonna be down . Come on .

MAN : That boy's still ugly

You gotta bend your knees
a little bit.

Bend your knees a little bit.

Now swing your arms.

Not like a monkey, dawg .

You gotta loosen up.

Let the tension out.

Heel , toe.
Heel , toe.

My God .
He's white.

Hey, Brandy.

How you doin' , boo?

Lonnie.
No, no, no.

You gotta talk from your nuts,
man . More bass.

This is the art of slap boxing .

A time-honored hood tradition .

Come on , Lonnie.
Put your hands up. Come on .

All right? Great.
Keep 'em up.

Uh , G?

G , man .

G .

[ Deep voice ]
Hey, Brandy.

Oh !
How was the date tonight?

lt wasn't that good ,
thanks to you two.

Didn't you use my note cards?

Yeah , l used those.

Tried to do a little
freestyling on my own .

Didn't really work.

Hey, man .
Hey, hey.

That was all Ass-anova
right there.

You know, l really like
this girl Brandy.

Little Carver really likes her.

Look, man , maybe y'all
can patch this up somehow.

Man , the way l acted tonight, G ,

l'll be lucky if that woman
ever talks to me again .

You didn't take your hat off,
did you?

Like a damn fool .

-Hey, Unc.

Babies screaming and everything .

Convenience store.

You inconvenient son of a bitch .

Keep the damn noise down

He's mad 'cause he got

Oh ! Hey! Hey.

-What are you doing?
-Oh , nothing .

What's going on?

-Hey.
-What?

Daddy has planned a big
family dinner on Saturday.

-Uh-huh .
-And he's invited you .

He's gonna have me as
the main course or something?

l can't this Saturday.

Why?

No Good's getting released
from prison on Saturday.

No Good is nothing but trouble.

And we have a son .

Come on .
Things are different now.

Baby, things are different
for him , too.

He's a reformed man now.
For real .

G , the two of you together
spells trouble.

Look.

All l know is that he's
my cousin

and he deserves a second chance.

Six ounces, just like Mama said .

Uh-huh . Test it.
Ahh .

There you go.
Come on .

Bruce Leroy,

Damn , that's some good
titty milk.

Ooh , ooh .

Yo, who the hell --

Oh , creature of habit, dawg .

Just trying to keep
my skills sharp, man .

Ah . Ah .

Aah !

[ Laughs ]
No Good's back!

Show your cousin
some love, baby.

You got it, baby.

Whoo!

Dawg , l can't believe
it's been two years

since you been locked down .

Well , had the jurisprudence
not violated

the statute of limitations
per se,

l would have only done
30 days, bro.

Did you get a law degree
in prison?

Nah . l watched ''The Practice''
for two seasons.

l'm representing myself
next time.

Oh , next time, huh?

You always had game, player.

You always had game.

Speaking of game, man ,
what's up with you?

You still boxing?

Yeah , but it's sort of been put
on the back burner for now.

Oh , really?

How come?

Remember we used to go
candyjacking back in the day?

-You mean the kung fu clerk.
-Yeah . Yeah , yeah .

Let's just say that a hot temper
runs in his family.

Really?
How you know that?

Um . . .

Well , his daughter had my baby.

Oh , shit!

Hey, hey, dawg ,

Uh . Yep.

Gimme a little bit.
Yep. Just a slap.

-Go on . Hit it.
-Hit it, now. Hey.

That's my little man .

Drive By, my man , your label is
the first one l thought of

when l discovered
the Brothas Stylz.

Check it out.

Some people think that, like,
we kinda like a white OutKast.

lf l want to know what people
think of you , l'll tell you .

-Come on .
-Very good , sir.

You remind people
of a white OutKast.

Yeah .

You really got your finger
on the pulse, there, Drive By.

You weren't thinking about going

Well , actually, you know. . .

You were always
the first choice.

-Right here.
-Right here, dawg .

Here's the contracts.

Sign 'em .

Wait, wait, wait.
This is it?

This is it.

Wanna talk royalties?
Cool .

parking permit, get at me.

But don't you ever. . .

issue.

You understand?

Yeah , yeah . We gonna sign

That calls for a celebration .

Oh , we gonna pop up

Today we're gonna discuss

lt's potty training .

Don't make those faces.

lt's not as hard as you think.

We're gonna do
some role-playing today.

Show you how to get your baby's
bottom onto the actual ring .

You might want to sing it a song
to relax the muscles.

@ Dookie, dookie,
doo-doo brown @

@ Mommy, how can l be down? @

Make some funny faces.

Now, it's also very important
to praise your child's movement.

''Look at that.

Look what Jason left behind .

Look at the big brown goldfish .

Yay!''
[ Clapping ]

Daddy, everyone,

On cable, every man

Now, go wash the dishes.

When you're done,

My father wants to

[ Speaking Chinese ]

G , l want to offer you a manager
position at the market.

Yes.

You know, Cha Ching ,
l really appreciate that.

But that's not

Ooh , shit.

Being a manager is a great job.

Look, l got a job.

Boxing is not a job.

You always say that.

But l got my shot coming up,
all right?

l thought you would be happy.

With this promotion , we could
finally get our own place.

Yo. That would be dope.
The three of us.

Hey, brother. Hey.

Whether it's brighter
to hang around the gym

And l would appreciate it if you

STAC Y:

DOMlNlC:

And we can do the right thing

Fathers.

Hangin' out with their kids.

NO GOOD: You need a wheelbarrow

G :
Oh , snap!

See, this is what l'm talking
about right here.

This is what l wish
l could get for my son .

Why don't you buy it?

Man , do you know how expensive
it is to raise a child now?

There's diapers.
There's formula.

-Not to mention the toys.
-Wow.

Hell , man , l barely got enough
for the necessities.

Yeah , l'm gonna get that.

Excuse me, ma'am .

Without the big hair, though .

When she was with the LaBelles.

Yeah , okay.

All right, now!
Freeze!

l want it chilly up in here!

Sir? We don't have
much money in the till .

You're welcome to it.

But l would recommend that

Did l ask you for money?

No, l did not.

Now, give me some

Some of them rattles.
Some ass thermometers.

Pronto.
Yeah . Yeah .

Y'all got some baby grub

Oh , and don't forget
the rubber nipples.

Yeah .

And the booties
for the baby's feet.

And cotton swabs.

Cotton swabs.

That reminds me.
ls the baby still on formula?

You should really start
going for organic.

Organic.
Right, right, right, right.

What the hell ''organic'' mean?

lt means it's grown naturally

without any harmful pesticides
that might poison your baby.

What?
You trying to poison my kid?

No!

l want everything organic
up in this bitch !

Right now!

l don't want nobody to move
for two minutes.

That's 1 50 seconds.

That didn't sound right.

Hoo-hoo!

Open the trunk.

Man , don't tell me
you just robbed the store!

Open the trunk, dawg .

What the hell did you do, fool?

They was robbin' us.

Just 'cause it's overpriced
don't mean you steal it.

Why you trippin'?

l did this for you , dawg .

What?

You the one got a baby
to handle.

Oh , l'm trippin'?

'Cause l ain't your
accomplice no more?

What? You got a baby now
so you don't work no more?

Oh , so robbin' is work now?

Yeah .

Man , they runnin' my plates.
Get in the car, man !

You like hanging out

Mmm , l can see how you eat

You know what?

Me and your daddy got you

Got it for free, too,

With a toy gun .

Made a clean getaway.

You know why?
You know why?

'Cause crime does pay.
Yes, it does.

Hey, baby.

What?

What's up, dawg?

Baby, what's the problem?
You mad?

Are you stupid?

What are you talking about?

Robbing baby stores?

Baby, that was No Good .

Tell that to your son when
your dumb ass ends up in jail !

Baby, l told you . . .

''Baby!''

Ow!

-NO GOOD: Damn !
-Shit!

God .

Yeah .

lt'll be okay.
Okay?

G , just look at it
as a chance to grow.

To get in touch with yourself.

Look, man , l'm tired
of touching myself.

l want my lady to touch me.

l want XiXi to touch me.

Where you goin' , sexy?

Big meeting today, fellas.

Gonna have a huge payday.

And maybe who knows, you know?

Get a place of my own .

Jas could have a backyard .

Her own room .

Man , you know what
you sound like?

What?
A bitch?

No.

A man .

All right.
l'll talk to you later.

G : You kind of dress like
a bitch , though .

[ Laughter ]

Drive By, you so crazy.

So, when did you guys
become such good friends?

This is gonna be hard .
This is gonna be real hard .

lt's gonna be hard for
the Stylz Brothas to say. . .

You ain't gonna be the
Brothas Stylz's manager no more.

That wasn't that hard .

No, no, no.
Very easy, dawg .

Let's go.

You're dismissed , bitch .

Dismizzle, bizzle.

l'm all right!

-Dang Ling , where's XiXi?
-She don't want to see your ass.

Cha Ching , where's XiXi?

G , we need to talk.

Outside.

You get that black eye boxing?

Nope.

From your daughter.

Yeah , she got a left hook
like her mother.

l don't smoke cigarettes.

Take a closer look, fool .

Special smoke.

Cure a chronic ailment.

Even a broken heart.

Hmm .

Damn , man .

All this time, l thought
you was uptight and shit.

You remind me of myself
when l was your age.

The Triads.

l was the leader
of the Far East Side Riders.

l dreamt of being
the Chinese Scarface.

Hey.

Say hello to my little friend .

Hey.

What happened?

Met XiXi's moms up at the club.

Got gander at junk in the trunk.

She made you turn
your life around .

Not before reality bitch-slapped
me in the face first.

Gangster Gung Ho
got cap busted in ass.

Pour a little out
for homies ain't here.

Yeah .

After that,
all l could think about

was giving my daughter and
my baby's mama a better life.

Any regrets?

One.

l didn't do it sooner.

Dominic.
Hi .

-Oh . l wasn't expecting you .
-Yeah , l know.

l just wanted to see
if we could talk maybe.

Well , this really
isn't the best. . .

Dominic.

What's she doing here?

You caught us at a bad time.
We just got out of the bath .

''We''?

Maybe we should talk.

Are you trying to tell me
you're a. . .

Let's be real .

Jasmine needs
a full-time parent.

For when she's sick.

For when she can't sleep.

You know you can't
be counted on for that.

No, that's not true.

That's what l wanted to
talk to you about.

We have to do
what's best for Jasmine.

And you think her having
two mommies is what's best?

Yes.

Venus and l are in love.

She's with Jasmine
every single day.

You're more into
the Stylz Brothas

than you are into being a dad .

Brandy.

Carver.

Wake your sorry asses up!

l ain't gonna say this
but one time.

So you damn well better hear me.

Now, Lonnie.

Don't get caught up in this
''baby's mama'' drama.

Now, you had you
a good woman in Brandy.

She a good woman .
She likes you .

And that baby likes you , too.

You need to be a man .

You need to go ahead
and pick your hair out

and get rid of them damn
deep-sea-diving goggles

and handle your business.

And you .

Rerun .

Huh?

Yeah , you .

You got a good woman , too.

But you're too damn lazy.

All you want to do is
lay up on your ass all day.

And you ain't no fighter.

Hell , l'll knock your dick
in the dirt, old as l am .

Yeah , you need to put
your family first.

Put your family first.

And , Dom , you ain't no player.

Now, Uncle Virgil was a player.

You hear me?

l was slammin' more Cadillac
doors and pimpin' more ho's

while you were still swimming
around in your daddy's nut sac.

And you got a good woman , too.

But no, you mad 'cause she done
got herself another woman .

Hell , be Uncle Virgil
back in the day,

l'd have both them chicks
over at my house right now.

Cookin' my breakfast.

Butt-naked .

With the house shoes on .

Best thing l can suggest to you

is you get yourself
back in your baby's life

as soon as you can .

Don't be like me, Dom .

End up old .

Lonely.

Living with
your goofy-ass nephew

and his broke-ass friends.

Do l really look like Rerun?

LONNlE :
Brandy!

MAN :
Slow down , kids.

Brandy!

Brandy, can you find it
in your heart to forgive me?

You know, the loving ,
the caring , the compassionate,

the dashing , the debonair,
the real Lonnie.

He's back.

And he'd like another chance.

How about dinner tonight?

l'm all ears.

You want some pig feet?

Ooh , is she a cutie pie.

BRAND Y:
Like her mama.

Yes, indeedy, feed the needy.

Want some ribs?

Some chitlins?

So, we were
high school sweethearts.

l thought
he was Prince Charming .

But he turned out to be a toad .

Your ex and my baby's mama
need to get together.

'Cause she's a rat.

A hood rat.

Right.

You know, l've always had
this idealistic view of family.

House in the burbs.

With the white picket fence.

And a cute puppy, like a. . .

BOTH :
Chocolate lab.

Oh .

Let me clean those for you .

Hey, are these new glasses?

Yeah , the other ones
are kind of large and square.

What you waitin' on , dawg?

An engraved invitation?

Huh?

Kiss her, fool .

Go, Lonnie.
Go.

Go, Lonnie.
Yeah .

l know Ho-landa's my mama.

But Brandy's all that
and a bag of tits.

He's right, boy.

l mean , check out those
tig old bitties.

l've been sucklin' those
chocolate-milk sacs for months,

and it is nice.

Lonnie.

Are you feeling okay?

No, l think l had
a little too much wine.

l guess it is getting
a bit late.

Yeah , maybe l should be going .

That's my daddy.

What the hell is. . .
Open up the door, fool .

What the hell is this, man?

Breakfast, fool .

No, man , l'm talking about what
the hell you do to the room .

My grandmother told me
make myself at home, man .

Want a grilled-cheese
sandwich , man?

No, l'm cool .

All right, then .

You still mad at me, man?

Look, Robin Hood .

Because of what you did ,
XiXi ain't speakin' to me.

l haven't even seen
my baby, man .

That little stunt you pulled
really messed my life up.

What's up with you , man?

You still the same guy that got
''Thug Life'' tatted on his arm?

Yeah , that's me.

But l got my son's name
tatted on the other arm now.

We gonna always be boys, man .

We family.

l got a family of my own now.

So that's my priority.

l feel you , dawg .

l'm proud of you , man .

Thanks, baby.

Now, you sure you don't want
one of these grilled cheese?

Yeah , go on
and hook me up one, man .

All right, then .
lt's organic.

What the hell you doin' bustin'
in here like you pay the bills?

l mean , like you're the police.

Sit your Count Crackula-lookin'
ass down .

-What?
-And you shut the hell up.

Show me some respect
around here.

'Cause Lord knows l earned it.

The days of you two bitches

using my baby boy
for a payday are over.

He's coming with me.

And maybe, just maybe,
if you get your shit together,

l might let you see him .

But Princess Ro-Ro --

But Ro-Ho, my ass.

Be-otch !

You don't like the way l roll ,
take me to court.

Come on , little Carver.

Let's go home.

Sorry you had to hear that, man .

Oh , don't worry.

You'll still get
your little $300 a week.

Ain't that what you had him for?

Let's get out of here.

Swoll !

Mama, no.

And l'm proud to say that many
of Philadelphia's top artists

have recorded right here
in this studio.

And we have
an award-winning engineering . . .

Dominic.
What are you doing here?

l just want to tell you
you're right.

Being a parent means
being there every day.

Look, l know
you don't need me, Nia.

But l need Jasmine.

Things haven't exactly
been going my way lately.

First the Brothas Stylz
fire me.

Then l find out
you're a lesbian .

Wait a minute.
You got fired?

You're a lesbian?

Thank you .

Thanks.

The other day,
l went to visit you , right?

l saw you and Venus
with Jasmine.

You guys looked
just like a family, you know.

And it became clear
what's important.

l need to be part
of my daughter's life.

l want to pack her lunch on
the first day of kindergarten .

l want to put Bactine
on her skinned knee

when she falls off her bike.

l want to keep her away
from players like me.

l know it sounds stupid .

But there's more to life
than chasing girls.

That's raising one.

Come here.

Let Daddy strap you in .

ROLONDA:
Swoll , leave him alone.

You can't bust up in here,
take Ro's baby,

and break out, Donnie!

What you want to do, little man?

Huh?
What you want?

lt's Lonnie!

Lonnie, partner.

Can l roll with you?

Not this time, Little Tupac.

Superboy that became Superman .

Ro, you shouldn't have
never let that man

slip through your fingertips.

G :
Hey.

Baby, l'm sorry.

l'm sorry it took me so long
to figure out

l wanted to spend
the rest of my life

with you and Bruce Leroy.

l don't want Bruce Leroy
growing up

not knowing who his father was
like l did .

l want him to be proud
to call me ''Dad .''

And l want you to be proud
to call me your husband .

XiXi .

G , you had me at ''hello.''

@ For the block, boy @

@ Take it rough @

@ Every day it's been the same
old thing on my block @

@ You either workin'
or you slangin'...

G: My man Lonnie
finally found happiness.

By the power vested in me
by the state of Pennsylvania,

l now pronounce you
husband and wife.

You may now kiss the bride.

G :
Look at that.

You got spit on her chin .

DOMlNlC:
Whoa.

Save something
for the hotel room , there.

Your kids gonna watch this.

Honeymoon time.
Honeymoon time.

Lon , the Carver 5000
is da bomb, man .

LONNlE :
Thank you , Uncle Virgil .

G: And Brandy inspired him to
achieve his dream

of becoming the most successful
black inventor

since the sister
who invented the hot comb.

Toys''R''Us just ordered
1 ,000 units of the Carver 5000.

Whatever happened to
the Stylz Brothas?

Yeah , yeah .
The white boys.

Kind of had a problem
at the Apollo.

What's up, my niggas?

[ Record scratches ]

-Bad management.
-Yeah , yeah , yeah .

G: Dom stopped being a player
and started being a father.

lnspired by his baby girl, Jas,

he decided to spin
his music career

in a different direction.

He created
Hip-Hopscotch Records,

and the first act he signed
was Little Tupac.
