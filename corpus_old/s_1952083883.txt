225 
But we linger too long. 

226 
We saw the fun festival. 

227 
But it seems best to go forward. 

228 
The evil thing that you need 
to kill him. 

229 
He seems 
really good guy. 

230 
It is always one of them after the festival. 

231 
At the very least, do not need to eat 
toxins since then. 

232 
Teen best muhennosta

233 
When you come back, remind

236 
This stew stinks. 

237

Drink out of time. 

238 
The man before. The fact that

239 
Do you know why he is kidnapped by Kitaro? 
Not a clue. 

240 
Want to know why the effort to see

241 
Shichigoro ... 
All very well. 

242 
Well tell us. 

243 
I have something to 
all want. 

244 
First, fill his stomach, and 
Tovi only so is the dream. 

245 
It is not even mine, but an orphan. 
Tapatutti father himself. 

246 
Promised to look after Kitaro; 
if he should die. 

247 
We were as brothers. 

248 
He was a man tappaneella 
reportedly had a strange appearance. 

249 
Afro, a green tint 
likeltä view. 

250 
Now listen carefully. 

251 
The world can be found in the blood ties deeper. 

252 
What? 

253 
It is a stupid friend had as many 
Other bands headbands suit. 

254 
Nettosi only their own demise. 

255 
Do you know what he said 
dying? 

256 
"Not anymore," she whispered. 

257 
Then I got No.2 headband strap themselves 
and hide it. 

258 
And I have fled since then. 

259 
But now you came from. 

260 
And now we're even. 

261 
So I think all managed

Now begins the event and 
ends sentimentality. 

264

266 
I figured that if you just stick 
Kitaro motion with -- 

267

268 
But fate is not ambiguous, 
escape. 

269

Only death and orphans. 

271

Death and orphans. 

272 
I will not give you a tape of forehead, but you have to 
to kill me for it. 

273 
I do not play forehead strip rules 
or save the world. 

274 
Afro! Why official position? 

275 
After all, he is cool, but 
none of your friends. 

276 
Hoida just do the job. 

277 
Because I promise, I think. 

278 
Do not think that I feel

279 
Thus what you did to bridge. Killed without 
the slightest hesitation. 

280 
As he would have only

281 
Maybe someone should whack you. 

282 
Perhaps I believe to be true 
get a man. 

283 
Will you let him throw the läppää. 
Diced him already! 

284

It was an unnecessary distraction. 

304 
Still want to die? 

305 
You want it around a lot. It is

306 
If you trust onneesi, come on

323 
Do you not own hearts? 

324 
It is not true. What the hell

326 
Do not think so either.

344 
And Miss Tomosan teach me

348 
I know, but you're safe here. 

349 
The family wanted a daughter 
lost farm. 

350 
I notice that they have accepted

351 
We both should be grateful. 
I try to visit more often. 

352

354

357 
A brother? 

358 
So it makes you 
including my brother. 

359 
Yeah, I guess? 

360 
Cool. I just received a new brother. 
Exactly. 

361 
Can I look at the sword to school sometimes? 

362 
Yes. Like at any time. 
You are shy. 

363 
And your hair is funny. 

364 
Nice to meet you'll. 

365 
You will soon be free. 

366 
You can not play with the science around. 
Are you crazy? 

367 
After graduating, he may well be 
be the perfect samurai. 

368 
If he is to grow, harassed, he 
can become a useless pile of protein. 

369 
Crazy? A strange word madness 
kuvajaisen mouth. 

370 
But the plan would be 
unable to self-destruction. 

371 
Dear Professor, it is 
Part of the process. 

372 
The more kiusaan Afroa, 
the better. 

373 
I want her suffering 
lasting a long time. 

374 
His death is not an end. It is 
only a point of GDP on. 

375 
Do you not understand me now? 

376 
Of course, šio mistress. You have 
kieroitunut indeed. 

377 
But there are risks. 

378 
How refreshing experience. 

379 
I do kieroitunut. World kieroin 
scientist has impressed me kieroudesta. 

380 
Do not be afraid my friend round. 

381 
Everything is going very 
According to the plans. 

382 
You could count on a bit. 

383 
Yes valtiattareni. 

384 
My advice and it does not end 
failure as Kuma. 

385 
He repaired so many times that 
he is no longer people are left. 

386 
He is just misguided samurai doll. 

387 
Soulless, dead. 

388 
But now, meat, bone ... 

389 
... blood. Life in developing nano-technology. 
Chemically active nerve endings. 

390 
And unlawful science that it is 
alkemiaa more than biotechnology. 

391 
You are indeed the world kieroin, 
shit-faced, and a genius scientist. 

392 
Cuts in hell tekosistasi 
nature. 

393 
Praise me so well, 
šio mistress. 

394 
I am not worthy ylistyksienne. 
You filth. 

395 
History of mourning hirmutekojasi,

396 
You have to burn alive. 

397 
Afro chasing me and my brother ...? 

398 
When he arrives, he sees 
syntiensä sanctions. 

399 
His twice killing the only friend, the -- 

400 
and my dear father, increase 
sword revenge. 

401 
And at the last moment, these hands will be 
to decide on Afro Samurai life. 

402 
Damn! 

403 
Here is hot! 

404 
Is it not a faster route to Cherry 
Hill Siin? It is certainly Sion win. 

405 
And it was really weird 
a family gathering. Did not Afro? 

406 
I think most excited when 
the father is alive, but --

How he could be with be alive? 
Would kusettaa.

And I was his legendary

campaign is nearing completion. 

466 
However, this is a sensitive phase and 
the slightest mistake can ruin everything. 

467 
They are gone. 
What do you mean? 

468 
They were not doing anything 
without any commands. What have you done? 

469 
Maybe they left the city. 

470 
What do you mean? 

471 
Or maybe they sued Afro 
Samurai alone. 

472 
Do not be afraid. Perhaps they 
may even win. 

473 
Yllätyt perhaps kuullessasi, but they

Furthermore, are full of drugs.

Aikomuksistasi viis. There are things that are 
we do not allow you to do. 

484 
We can not allow the queen bee of Sion

A wonderful young lady, when you have. 

486 
We will not allow his ylväytensä suffer. 

487 
We are a sinner factors

488 
I wanted to Afron, only to see 
tuhoamansa city. 

489

495 
Do-it-mistress Sion behalf. 

496 
Go away. 

497 
Afro Samurai ... 

498 
I knew that before long 
such a day would be affected. 

499 
We die together. 

500 
Afro you made it. 

501 
How did you do it? 
Why not only property? 

502 
I got hit, and the arrow on it. 
Fortunately, I am steel. 

503 
Teilasit the comedy of the pump? 

504 
What the ...? 

505 
Follow me, son. 

506 
It is not my God! 

507 
I have officially seen it all. 

508 
Sio, Jinno. 

509 
Afro-bye! Why do you need to walk 
each trap. 

510 
Are you latvasta rotten? 

511 
Here can be found in the wires 
vetelevä crazy bitch. 

512 
And once again come to life robottikamusi, 
who does not like you. 

513 
Kirsikkana cake turned on a freak, 
you think you isäksesi. 

514 
That is the right father. 

515 
Wrong answer, and it 
makes you idiots. 

516 
And beyond that I do not come. 

517 
See you. 

518 
I came to my father, and 
nro.1 forehead because of the tape. 

519 
Surprise, surprise. 

520 
What can you do, the body of a 
that right? 

521 
We kidutamme you. Death 
will be a slow process. 

522 
Why not have nro.1 forehead tape? 

523 
I just wanted to take revenge on you. 

524 
Was the reason for the removal, the fate of the burden 
must assume the forehead after receiving the tape. 

525 
You should know this by now. 

526 
Nro.1 can never escape from 
vuodatusta blood. 

527 
Nro.1 kill or 
will be killed. 

528 
You can not pick and choose who 
blood hides. 

529 
Take Back otsanauhasi. 
Take the fear son. 

530 
Father wait. 
Father. 

531 
See, see my dear brother. 

532 
Afro Samurai loppunsa points, 
Just as I planned. 

533 
For your own father's hands through. 

534 
He finally paid with pain, which 
returned to us, and thousands of others. 

535 
Jinno, Jinno! 

536 
Kill him. 
Kill him once! 

537 
A brother ... 

538 
Kill her Afro, teilaa! It does not 
your father's right. 

539 
Just so, do it. 

540 
I do not intend to kill my dad. 

541 
Then came their way into Afro head. 

542 
Did you see that Jinno? 

543 
We did it. We shared at last 
right for him. 

544 
And we killed him. 

545 
See, see the blast brother. 

546 
Jinno ... 

547 
A brother ... 

548 
A brother ...! 

549 
What have you done? 

550 
What have you done Afrolle! 

551 
Why? 

552 
Jinno! Why protect Afroa now? 
He is dead. 

553 
It is useless! 

554 
Have you forgotten what the 
Afro did to us? 

555 
Did you? 

556 
Jinno! 

557 
Afro. Watch me 
dearest brother. 

558 
I need to protect 
sword master dojoa. 

559 
Must protect all. 

560 
Including brother, Afroa. 

561 
I love you, my Jinnoni. 

562 
My brother. 

563 
It is the time elapsed. 
Is not it so šio? 

564 
How could you, princess? 

565 
Jinno. 

566 
You can not win the Afro. 
To escape the hell kind. 

567 
It is too strong overcome. It does not 
not a human being. 

568 
Do not, do not! 

569 
Shut up. 

570 
It is a point over. 

571 
Excuse me, but not my father. 

572 
My father died a long time ago. 

573 
Do not be afraid. 

574 
Father. 

575 
As soon as you're ready. 

576 
Naama Stasi was judging 
hellish bad day. 

577 
I noticed, right. You knew that 
it will never end. 

578 
But do not turn back. 

579 
Otherwise, to hell ryntäät. 

580 
I have been waiting for you a long time.
