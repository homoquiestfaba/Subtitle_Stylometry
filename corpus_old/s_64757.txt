A toke?

Do the fucking toe thing, all right?

You know the rules.

I'm getting out!

Just look at my feet. Jesus Christ.
Fuck it!

Just do the fucking...
Just look at my feet.

Shut up!

Don't fucking look at me!
Fucking pussy.

Pay me.
You fucking like it.

I'd fucking like it if you pay me.

Fucking loser.

Fucking slut.

I don't want to deal with this...

You have to deal with this.

Thank God this was not an emergency.
Well, it isn't?

That is very interesting, ma'am.

It's against the law to call 911
when it's not an emergency.

Let's take her in right now. Come on.

Is that the best thing
the police department has to do today?

It'd be the best thing I've done all year.

Okay, ma'am,
what seems to be the problem?

Besides her attitude?

Yes, besides that. How can we help you?

I haven't heard from my son in days.

And he's not answering his phone.

Just stand back. Stay here.
We'll take a look around.

Check all the windows.
Thank you.

I'm going in.

Hello?

Calm down.

Shit.
Calm down.

I entered the house from the side.

Found Officer Martinez in the kitchen.

Look, keep her out of here.
I'm from the <i>Los Angeles Chronicle</i>.

No civilians. Period.

Dumb bitch.

...and found Officer Martinez in the kitchen.

Who dropped the evidence there?

Who came in through the back door?

I did.

Well, you stepped on
the only good footprint.

Good work.

You got a spot on your uniform.

I ordered Officer Martinez around the back.
It was my call.

I had no cause.
We're gonna take it from here.

Can I say something?

I know you guys know everything and all...

but there's something
you might want me to point out.

We'll take it from here.
What is it?

Was she raped after she was killed?

Police work's a guessing game for you?
No.

Why do you think she was raped?

Am I right?

The medic said that...

it was something like that...

except a little more sick.
You know what I mean?

Let's go, Martinez.

I bet he only cut out the man's eyes, right?
Not the woman's.

He's afraid of men,
and he wants power over women.

You're brilliant. Survey says: Wrong.

Are we fucking done here?

He cut the woman's eyes out, not the man's.

You'll earn your stripes some other time.
Is that it?

Yeah, that's it.

Next time you show up at a homicide,
you see a body, call us.

Don't fucking touch nothing. You got it?
Good.

Officer, can I speak to you for a second?

What is it?

What did you find inside that house?

Why don't I tell you
all about it over dinner, sweetheart?

Leave her alone. Come on.

I'm sorry we can't be of any more help.
You're gonna have to wait...

for the official press release like
the rest of the media. That's all. Thank you.

Can you believe the way those guys
spoke to me? I am so fucking over it.

Forget about that shit.

That punk white boy's got his head
so far up that nigger's ass...

you can't even understand him anyway.

Is that why you didn't back me up?

I didn't back you up because
I don't give a shit what them <i>putos</i> think.

Can we go?

Mommy, you left the door unlocked
again and it's very late at night.

It's very dangerous.

<i>In Beirut, Lebanon,</i>
<i>a militant Islamic faction...</i>

<i>has claimed responsibility</i>
<i>for the deadly suicide bombing...</i>

You want pizza?

<i>... more than 230 U.S. Marines dead.</i>

Let me cut. You know what, stop it.
This is, you know, for everyone.

Did you see Mom today?

Is she still listening to that crazy stuff?

Open your fucking trunk.

You want to do business, or no?

What's taking so long?

What the fuck is this?

There's something wrong with you.

That's four people in one night.

This is unbelievable.

My fucking wife is going crazy.
All my PG neighbors are going crazy.

I was thinking about
asking Father Rodriguez...

if he has any insight.

Homo Rodriguez? Whatever works for you.

If I were you, I'd be thinking
about what I was gonna say...

if they ask me to be on
the Night Stalker Task Force...

as a homicide detective.

Why do you say that?

Because Lt. Mayberry
was asking me about you.

I told him you were perfect for the job.

Why didn't you tell me?

Why didn't I... Who cares why? I don't care.

Don't go getting all high and mighty on me.

They probably just need...

a chick cop from East LA
to make themselves look good on TV.

I knew you were gonna say
something stupid like that.

Okay.
Thanks.

If you're so fucking psychic...

you should be making
a lot more than $20,000 a year.

Now, detectives... They make about $25,000.

You think the job is bullshit?

I think everything is bullshit.
Maybe I'll take the job.

Forget about why they're offering it to me.
I can prove them wrong.

Why don't you just take that job,
make a good paycheck...

and go fucking shopping?

What about you?

What do you mean, what about me? What?

What about you?
Shoot.

Why would I care what you do?

<i>Community leaders from East Los Angeles</i>
<i>staged a protest today at City Hall...</i>

<i>blaming a lack of police involvement</i>
<i>and concern in the Night Stalker case.</i>

<i>Protestors demonstrated,</i>
<i>and argued that the LAPD...</i>

<i>has turned a blind eye</i>
<i>to the recent killings...</i>

<i>because the victims have been</i>
<i>predominantly Hispanic women...</i>

<i>in the lower middle-class suburbs</i>
<i>of East Los Angeles.</i>

<i>The LAPD only cares about rich people</i>
<i>and white-bread communities...</i>

<i>and that's why they haven't caught this guy.</i>

<i>Although Chief Bates</i>
<i>has categorically ruled out...</i>

<i>the possibility of racism or sexism</i>
<i>in the Los Angeles Police Department...</i>

<i>outsiders have felt that</i>
<i>the predominately white male police force...</i>

<i>has in general ignored</i>
<i>minority communities and women's issues.</i>

<i>And these latest events only highlight</i>
<i>what is a deep-rooted endemic problem.</i>

<i>The continued failure of the police</i>
<i>to find a suspect...</i>

<i>has the East Los Angeles community...</i>

Mommy, I've told you at least a thousand
times to keep the front door locked at night!

How long have you been here?
Five minutes.

I was upstairs talking with your mother.

How is she?

Father Rodriguez is here for dinner.
You want dinner?

I don't think they're here.
Where are they?

<i>Yo no sé.</i> But I do want dinner.

You want to eat?
That's what I came for.

I'm so glad you're here.

<i>- Estoy Ilena.</i>
You're a good cook.

Yeah, right.

What did you want to talk to me about?

So, I was offered...

a job as a Detective, Homicide Detective...

in this case.

And it's really crazy.

I want to ask you some questions
to see if you have any insight.

Detective.
Yeah.

Can you believe that?

Come on, don't do this.

I was there.

What do you want me to say?

I don't know.

Can you tell me anything about him?

About this one.
See, look at the markings there...

and numbers...

This isn't Satan at work.

If you want me to say
that this is a religious thing...

a battle between good and evil...

I'm afraid you're out of luck.

I guess I was just hoping...

that such awfulness
would have an equal match.

What about you?
What about me what?

Maybe this is a sort of divine intervention.

Maybe you were always meant
to work on this case.

Maybe this will help you
to put to rest your father's death.

Or I was just...

I don't know.
I wanted to be like that so much that...

I took a job that I can't handle.

Then don't take it.

What about that job offer you had
teaching at the university?

I still have it.

And?

It's back East and
I can't leave Mom and the kids.

Why?
I can't do that.

What's gonna happen to them?

What's happening to them now?
I take care of these people.

Can you imagine Mom out there by herself,
and Gustavo and Marco... Please.

And who takes care of you?

Hello?

Hi, honey.

Yeah.

No, I'm sorry you have to work so late.

I wish I was there with you.

Yeah, really.

You know, the usual stuff.

Trash TV, shopping. Exciting.

Again?

Where do you think you put it?

Okay.

Honey, I...

You fucking bitch!

Say you love Satan!
Don't hurt me.

Swear to Satan, you fucking bitch!
I won't do anything.

Don't fucking look at me!
Please, God.

Don't look at me! Fuck.

Swear to fucking Satan! Fucking bitch!

Swear to Satan.
Take everything you want.

Don't fucking look at me!

Fuck you, look at me!

I'll do that for you.
I will fucking kill her for you.

I want to fucking rape her for you.
Yeah. Dead one.

She's got hair all over her shirt and hands.

I would say it's probably the victim's.

Satan's vengeance.

10-52.

We got to stop him.

Look at this.

The mother wiped his hands.

All the pictures are turned over.

Look.

The fucker doesn't want anyone to watch.

Look at this.

And?

And it's the same shoe print again.

We already know it's the same guy.

Yeah. And now we know
that he wears a unique type of shoe.

Okay, listen. Forensics have had this
for three months now.

They still can't tell us what brand it is.

Now that's something.

All right?
Right.

Come in.

So, you're taking the job?

I guess so.

I know that
you've already turned down two...

<i>dos...</i>

promotions since you've been here.

Why now?
I don't know.

Maybe it's because you saw
the pain this guy caused firsthand?

Maybe.

And you think you want to
do something about it?

I don't know. Maybe.

Come in. Sit down. We won't bite.

Do you have her file?
Yeah.

Let me see that.

UCLA undergrad.

Masters in Criminology from Berkeley.

Impressive.

That just means
I'm overqualified and under-skilled.

Doesn't mean that
I'm going to be a good detective.

Damn right.

But I've got a gut feeling.

You're making it look like
I don't have any manners.

Take my seat. Go ahead.

Sit down. Go ahead.

So what do we have so far?
Very little.

We know he's sick, vicious, strikes at night.

So far he's targeted
mostly middle-class family neighborhoods.

No fingerprints. His gun's unregistered.

No clues.

Other than a pair of shoe prints.

Basically, we don't got shit.

What about the FBI?

They've been working
for months on a profile.

They haven't come to any conclusions.

Welcome aboard.

My love, you have a phone call.

What happened, Mom?

You have a telephone call.

What time is it, Mom?

It's 5:00 a.m.

What are you doing up so early?

Jesus woke me up, he's here in the house.

The Devil killed someone again last night...

...and I knew it was going to happen.

Who told you that?

Jesus, my love.

Everybody has to die sometime
and some people go to hell.

It's okay, Mommy, it's okay.

Hand me the phone. Who's calling?

Nobody.
Nobody? You said someone called.

Yeah, sorry, yeah?

Yeah, I'll be right there.

Hang it up. I have to go out.

I have to go, Mommy,
they are calling me in to work.

I'm going to tell you a story...

No stories right now, I have to go.

We can play if you want to...
let's play a game!

Mom, when I get back I promise
I'll play any game you want.

Then I'll give you a bath and dress
you up and make you very pretty.

I already did the report.
You sure you want to see this?

Yeah.
Good.

Ladies first.

It's the third night in three weeks.

Our guy's getting meaner and sloppier.

You know, Martinez...

Homicide's not for everybody.

Well, it's for me.
Really?

Yeah, really.

You notice anything unusual in there?
Unhuman is more like it.

Fuck.

No, our guy's human.

He made himself dinner
while the husband bled to death.

He only ate a few bites,
and a glass of her blood.

Jesus, stop it.

Go home, Martinez. Get some rest.

You know, our guy's skinny.

What?
I bet he's skinny.

Why would he only take a few bites...

after going through the trouble
of making dinner?

It's drugs.

Maybe.

He's no genius serial killer either.

Why?

Because almost every word
scribbled on the wall was misspelled.

He's definitely uneducated.

Juvenile son of a bitch.

Good.

Makes sense.

Let's go back to the station.
Mayberry's waiting for us.

It's good.

<i>Anti-U.S. protests in the Middle East</i>
<i>are rising to a fevered pitch...</i>

<i>as the President struck a deal</i>
<i>with our Middle East Allied Front...</i>

<i>to provide them with chemical</i>
<i>and ballistic weapons training...</i>

<i>and support</i>
<i>in exchange for using military bases.</i>

<i>In order to combat the evil,</i>
<i>totalitarian regimes of Libya and Iran...</i>

<i>the people of Iraq can be</i>
<i>an invaluable friend of the United States.</i>

<i>According to the plan suggested...</i>

<i>supplying regimes in the Middle East</i>

<i>further escalates tension.</i>

<i>Citizens of East Los Angeles are protesting</i>
<i>again downtown today...</i>

<i>as two more victims of the Night Stalker</i>
<i>were found today, both young women.</i>

<i>In a related story, gun sales in Los Angeles</i>
<i>are at an all-time high.</i>

Get up!

Wake up! Let's go.

You stay.

Don't look at me!

Do you love Satan?

Do you love Satan? Say you love Satan!

Come here.
Wait.

Take me.
Don't look at me.

Do whatever you want to me,
but please leave my daughter alone.

Do you love Satan?

Yes, I love Satan. Please leave...

Mom...

Shut up, Tina. Go to the other room.

Nobody can leave! Take your clothes off.

Yes, I want to take my clothes off.

But my daughter cannot watch this, please.
Let us have a little privacy.

Go into the closet and close your eyes.

Can you walk?

Okay, then. Let's hurry.
Sneak out the back door.

You fucking bastard!

He had really dark eyes. Really dark...

and oval shaped.

He had a... long, thin face.

He kind of had, like,
these dark circles under his eyes.

He was really pale.

Do you have any idea
who the suspect might be?

He's a male, late 20s, early 30s.

Size nine-and-a-half shoe.

Loner, drug user.

Maybe had some military training.
Possibly a Vietnam veteran.

Why Vietnam?
Have the murders been particularly violent?

They have been, particularly.

Look, we're going to catch this guy,
whoever he is.

Thank you for your time.

Can't you release a sketch of the suspect?

How is the public
supposed to protect itself?

We're releasing the sketches
to members of our task force.

We're doing our job.
But you're not doing your job.

There have been 14 murders...

A vigilante scenario would not be
in the public's best interests.

Why not?
Like I said earlier...

we have an all-points bulletin
on the suspect...

while the supercomputer
searches for a match.

What if the supercomputer
doesn't find a match? Then what?

Then we'll cross that bridge
when we get to it.

You'll cross that bridge...

This is the first bit of information
that could save someone's life...

and you're not releasing it. Why is that?

Thank you for your time.

Thank you for your time.

Great.

"Why is that?" Fucking imbecile!

I'll tell you why is that. Fucking stupid.

His back, his left incisor's crooked?

Look.
Let me see.

Here. Here.

Our guy's got a smile
only his mother could love.

The sicko doesn't have a mother.

Just wanted to let you guys know
that there's still no match.

The Chief wants everybody back
out on the street, including you guys.

Still no match.

How exactly does
this supercomputer work anyway?

I've no fucking idea.

Okay. So how long we gonna wait?

I don't know.
Maybe we should've released the sketch.

Maybe.

I'll tell you one thing,
if this guy kills again...

we'll see a community uproar out there
like nothing we've seen.

Yeah. That Mexican community's not happy.

I think it's more than strange
that he's hit three times in East LA.

Easy access. Close to freeways.

Not a lot of local police presence.

Yeah. Or...
The killer is Latino.

Bingo.
Yes.

The mother and daughter never said
he had an accent.

Not every Hispanic person has an accent.

Still, why would he go after his own people?

That is the most racist thing
I've ever heard in my entire life.

What?

This psycho doesn't have any people.

You watch the way you talk to me,
young lady.

Do you hear that? "Young lady."
"His own people." Listen to yourself.

You fucking mock me.
Easy. Come on.

All right.
We're all after the same bad guy here.

Come on.

Great work, Martinez.

You're really doing a great job here.

Smart and beautiful.
Now, that's a rare combination.

Excuse me. What are you trying to do?

You okay?
I'm fine.

You don't look fine.
You look like you've been crying.

I'm fine.

Do you want to talk about it?

I said I was fine. Even if I wasn't,
I wouldn't talk about it with a stranger.

Come on. I know you and you know me.

I'm the evil reporter, right?

How would you feel
about letting me borrow that sketch...

for, you know, like an hour or so?

Really. I'm sorry.

No.

We could talk about it
over a cocktail or two.

I'm buying.
I don't drink, honey.

Do you eat?

Maybe some other time.

You know, if you drop the sketch again...

I wouldn't tell anyone.

You're so sure of yourself. How nice.

Only when I know I'm right.

I'm not going to risk my job for you.

You're not risking anything.
A reporter never burns their source.

I promise.

No one will ever know
that you gave it to me.

Take a seat.
Yes, sir.

Do you know why I've been here an hour
waiting for you?

Did he kill again last night?
Cut the crap.

Don't make yourself look like more of a fool.

I'm here because of your blatant disregard
for protocol and procedure.

Now, how did she get the sketch?

I gave it to her.

And what did you think
you would accomplish by doing that?

Chief, I made a mistake and I apologize.
Really?

I can explain...
No, you can't.

Do you know how many strings
I had to pull to get you this job?

Homicide is the créme de la créme of LAPD.

And you let some uppity reporter
get the best of you.

You don't deserve this.

It won't happen again.

What a headache.

Leave your gun and badge,
and the rest of this mess with Lt. Mayberry.

Got it?

Chief, listen...
Not now, Martinez.

I need a word with you.

I could talk to the Chief for you.

No, thanks.

A formal suspension...

does not look good for the career.

I could talk to the Chief for you.
Tell him to relax a bit.

I heard what you said, and I said no, thanks.

Maybe you don't understand what I mean.

What do you want from me?

What every man would want.

What any guy would want.

I know.

What kind of example am I setting
for the rest of the community?

If you don't care what other people think,
you came to the right place.

Have a beer.

<i>Gracias.</i>

You obviously heard what happened, right?

What? Getting suspended?

Every good cop gets suspended
at least once.

And besides...

because I found your suspect...

and told the Chief that it was your lead...

you'll be back to work tomorrow.
You found something?

Not something, someone.

No shit.

How did you find this out?

Some down and dirty police work.

It wasn't that hard.
Where is he?

Downtown hotel.

Real crack-land shithole.

SWAT should be raiding it
right now as we speak.

Drink your beer.
You know what?

After we go downtown. Come on.

And since when have you cared?

I just do.

All right.

Shit. I don't have my fucking badge.

What am I...
Here, take this.

Is Mayberry here?
Just left about 15 minutes ago.

Did they catch the suspect?

I know I'm on fucking suspension.

Send someone to my house right now.
My family is in danger.

<i>We're not allowed to speak with you.</i>

Stop this bullshit,
and get some fucking balls.

<i>- I don't have time for this.</i>
Give me the mic.

This is Officer Luis.

Officer Martinez has me held hostage
at gunpoint at her house.

Send backup immediately.
The situation is critical.

<i>- Is this some kind of a joke?</i>
Does this sound like a joke?

Here, take my piece.

Mommy?

Shit!

Mommy.

The Devil.
The Devil was here.

He's looking for you...

Is he gone?

Where are Marco and Gustavo?

Marco and Gustavo, your sons,
where are they?

I don't have any sons
and it's you he's looking for.

Where did he go? Over there?

When did he leave?

I don't remember.
Why are you looking for him?

He can't do anything good for you.

You're okay, right? Did he hurt you?
Did he touch you?

It's you that he wants to hurt.

He's going to teach you a lesson...

...and some reporter as well.

The reporter.

What?
The reporter, the girl.

Let's go.

Mom, the police are on the way and
they're going to take care of you.

Just stay here and calm down.

If something happens to you, it's
because Jesus wants it to happen.

It's okay, Mom. Promise me that
you're going to calm down.

Let's go!

I told the Devil everything
about your Father,

everything about your Father, my little girl.

<i>... and has so far killed hundreds</i>
<i>and injured thousands of local villagers...</i>

<i>Do you know what kind of shit you're in?</i>

Why didn't you tell me
about the hotel room?

You put me and my family in danger.

<i>You are on suspension, that's why.</i>

You sacrifice me and my family
because I'm on suspension? Fine.

But what about the reporter?
What did she do? What didn't she do?

<i>We have her house and your house</i>
<i>under surveillance.</i>

That's bullshit
'cause I was just at my house.

<i>I know. My guys saw you and Luis</i>
<i>break into your own house.</i>

Did they tell you the Night Stalker
went into my mother's bedroom?

<i>Nobody has entered the house.</i>

Send somebody there right now.
And go check it. Please.

<i>Martinez, you there?</i>

Yes, sir.

<i>How close are you guys to Malibu?</i>
<i>My surveillance team isn't responding.</i>

Freeze, fuckhead!

He went out the front door.

Hang in there, come on, partner.

That fucking bum got me.

Just breathe, come on. It's okay.

But he ain't got much. I...

Dear God.

I did it for you.

I killed them for you!

I'll kill her.

Okay, sir.

You okay?

I'm all right.

I'm sorry, Martinez. He was a good cop.

You didn't even know him.

No, I didn't.

You want a ride home?

<i>10-34 to Alpha 72.</i>

<i>Respond to a 2-13, downtown,</i>
<i>Alameda and Seventh.</i>

You want another shot at the title?

Well, if it isn't the creepy foot freak.

What will it be tonight?

And remember, don't touch me
unless you've got $60.

There you go.

Come on.

Here they are.

Hello?

We're going to do this, or what?

Come on. Fucking faggot.

Whip it out
or I'm getting out of this shitmobile.

These freaks. All over the fucking place.

How come this guy keeps disappearing?

We just gotta keep looking.

We've been here six hours.

Your partner just died in your arms.
You wanna give up and go home?

Don't even go there, all right?

Don't talk about Luis.

All right. As soon as we stabilize her.

What did he look like?

Not now, Elliot, please.

Excuse me.
Not now!

At least wait till she gets to the hospital.
What did he look like?

Real good-looking.

Very thin.

His eyes looked black or something.

Have you been watching TV?
Have you seen the police composite?

I don't even have a toothbrush.

Where's the sketch?
It's in the car.

I apologize for his behavior.

We're just a little out of it with this one.

Is this him?
Yeah, that's him.

Where did he go?
I don't know.

Where did you see him last?
Leave her alone.

Yeah. That's it!
Shut up!

Where did you see him last?
Under the Sixth Street bridge.

I'm calling for backup.
I'm not leaving this now. Wait here.

I can handle it.

Like you handled the hooker?
The woman back there.

I was trying to be compassionate.
That's part of being a good detective.

That's also why I was hired
for this case. Clear?

You were hired to be part of this case
as a public service announcement.

That's all.

Fuck you.

Okay, you wait here, okay?
You watch my back.

Elliot, look! No, behind you!

Go call for backup.

I'm going in with you.
No, go call for backup.

Don't go near him, Elliot.

It's not him.

Fuck! Martinez!

Do you love Satan?

Say you love Satan, you bitch!

I can see you're a fucking slut. Yeah.

Don't touch me.

I can smell you.

I'm not afraid of you, motherfucker.
Yes, you are!

You are.

You know it. Daddy's girl can't hide.

I'm not afraid of you.

I can see. I can see Satan's
been with you a very long time.

I'm gonna be glad
when you're gone, motherfucker.

But I'm not gonna be gone ever!

Is he dead?

He's not moving. Come on, let's see.

You make sure he's dead.
Check up, all right?

I'm gonna go get an ambulance.
I'm gonna go see if...

Fuck me! You fucking kill him.

You fucking kill him.

This is Detective Martinez. I have an officer
down on Sixth Street and Santa Fe...

underneath the bridge.
I need backup and paramedics, please.

<i>10-34 responding.</i>
<i>We have a unit in that area.</i>

Shit.

Don't move.

Don't fucking move!

Shoot me.

Kill me.

Come on.

Shoot me.

Put the gun in my mouth
and pull the trigger. Come on, fucking bitch.

Shut the fuck up and don't move!

Come on, you fucker.

Come on, you little fucking bitch!

Fucking kill me, come on.

You come here to kill me.
Fucking kill me, bitch.

Come on, fucking bitch, shoot me!

I'm not like you, motherfucker.

<i>The manhunt has been a struggle</i>
<i>for police for months.</i>

<i>It lasted at least 14 weeks with five dead</i>
<i>and one police officer dead.</i>

<i>The most recent death</i>
<i>taking place last night...</i>

<i>as Officer Frank Luis, the man responsible</i>
<i>for setting off the chain of events...</i>

<i>that led to the Night Stalker's capture</i>
<i>was shot and killed.</i>

<i>We have this comment</i>
<i>from Chief Bates of the LAPD.</i>

<i>We believe that this man is in fact</i>
<i>the person referred to...</i>

<i>as the Night Stalker,</i>
<i>and the person responsible...</i>

<i>for the brutal rapes and murders</i>
<i>of women here in Los Angeles.</i>

<i>I'd like to thank</i>
<i>all the hardworking police...</i>

<i>and some citizens that helped bring</i>
<i>this tragic series of murders to an end.</i>

<i>Hopefully, this capture marks the end...</i>

<i>of one of the most fearful years</i>
<i>in Los Angeles history.</i>
