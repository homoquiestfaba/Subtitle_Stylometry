They ought to make the day
the time changes

the first day of summer.

What?
Well, it's 8:00

and it's still light.

A lot of good
extra daylight does,

we still have
a three-hour drive.

We won't get back
until after midnight.

Well,
if it really bugged you, Johnny,

you wouldn't do it.

You think I wanna blow
a Sunday on a scene like this?

You know,
I figure we're either gonna have

to move Mother out here or move
the grave into Pittsburgh.

She can't make a trip like this.

I don't know that she can't.

Look at this thing,
"We still remember."

I don't.

You know, I don't even remember
what the man looks like.

Johnny,
it takes you five minutes.

Yeah. Five minutes
to put it on the grave,

six hours, back and forth.

Mother wants to remember,
so we trot 200 miles

into the country,
and she stays at home.

Johnny, we're here,
all right?

REPORTER: <i>...back on.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are coming back on the air</i>

We are...

There's nothing wrong
with the radio.

It must have been the station.

Which row was it in?

[dramatic music playing]

I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

Well, the flowers die,

and the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

I wonder how many times
we've bought the same one.

Hey, come on, Barb.
Church was this morning, huh?

[thunder rumbling]

Hey, I mean,
praying's for church.

Come on.

BARBARA: Well, I haven't
seen you in church lately.

sense in my going to church.

Do you remember one time
when we were small,

we were out here?

It was from right over there.

I jumped out at you
from behind the tree,

and grandpa got all excited,
and he shook his fist at me,

and he said,
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell."

[thunder rumbling]
JOHNNY: Remember that?

Right over there.

You used to really
be scared here.

Johnny.
Hey, you're still afraid.

Stop it now. I mean it.

They're coming to get you,
Barbara.

Stop it.
You're ignorant.

JOHNNY: They're coming for you,
Barbara.

Stop it. You're acting
like a child.

JOHNNY:
They're coming for you.

He'll hear you.
Here he comes now.

I'm getting out of here.
Johnny.

BARBARA: [gasps]
Johnny, help me!

[thunder clapping]



[glass breaks]



[thunder rumbles]

[zombie snarling]

[doorknob clicks]



[suspenseful music playing]







[tires screeches]

It's all right.

The truck's out of gas.

The pump out there is locked.

Is there a key?

We can try to get out of here
if we can get some gas.

Is there a key?

Do you live here?

Jesus.

We gotta get out of here.

We have to get to where
there's some other people.

[ominous music playing]

What's happening?


[glass breaks]

Two of them.

There are two of them out there.

Have you seen any more?
BARBARA: I don't know.

I don't know.
I know you're afraid

but we have to try.
BARBARA: I don't know.

I don't know what's happening.

[zombie groans]

[zombie grunting]




[zombie snarling]

[suspenseful music playing]

They know we're in here now.


[suspenseful music playing]

BEN: Don't look at it.

[crickets chirping]

[zombies snarling]

Get some more lights
on in this house.

Why don't you see
if we can find some wood,

some boards, something there
by the fireplace,

something we can nail
this place up?

Look, goddamn it!

Look, I know you're afraid.

I'm afraid, too.

But we have to board
the house up together.

We'll be okay here
until someone rescues us,

but we have to work together.

Now, I need you
to get some wood, okay?

Okay?

[music box playing]

[suspenseful music playing]

They're afraid now.
They're afraid of fire.

I found that out.

You know a place back down
the road called Beekman's?

Beekman's Diner?

Anyhow, that's where I found
that truck I have out there.

[car engine revving]

REPORTER: <i>...back on.</i>

strange reports coming in.</i>

[fire crackling]


Hey, get out of there!
It's not...


[suspenseful music playing]

[zombies snarling]

I realized that I was alone

with 20 or 30 of those things.

I started to drive.

I just plowed
right through them.

They didn't move.
They didn't run.

Just stood there, staring at me.

I just wanted to crush them.

They scattered
through the air like...

bugs.

We were riding in the cemetery.

We came to put a wreath
on my father's grave

and Johnny said, "Oh, it's late.

Why did we start so late?"

And I said, "Johnny, well,
if you'd gotten up earlier,

we wouldn't be late."

Johnny kept teasing me
and saying,

"He's coming to get you,
Barbara!"

And then, Johnny ran away.

Why don't you just keep calm?

And he grabbed me.

He grabbed me
and he ripped at me.

He held me
and he ripped my clothes.

I screamed, "Johnny, help me!"

And Johnny fought this man

and I was so afraid.

I ran, I ran,

and Johnny didn't come.

We'd better go get him.

We have to get Johnny.

Please,
we have to go get Johnny!

My brother is alone.

Your brother is dead.

How long you guys
been down there?

I could have used some help.

That's the cellar.
It's the safest place.

You mean
you didn't hear the racket

we was making up here?

How are we supposed to know

what was going on up here?

It could have been those things
for all we knew.

That girl was screaming.

Anybody would have known
somebody needed help.

It's kinda hard to hear
what's going on from down there.

For all we knew,
that could mean those things

were in the house after her.

And you wouldn't come up
and help?

That racket sounded
like the place

was being ripped apart.

How are we supposed to know
what was going on?

Now, wait a minute.

You just got finished saying
you couldn't hear it

from down there.

Now, you say it sounded like
the place

was being ripped apart.

It would be nice if you'd get
your story straight, man.

We luck into a safe place

and you're telling us
that we got to risk our lives

just because somebody
might need help, huh?

Yeah, something like that.

All right.
Why don't we settle this like...

Look, mister, we came up, okay?

We're here.

Now, I suggest we all go back
downstairs before

any of those things find out
we're in here.

They can't get in here.

Oh, you got
the whole place boarded up?

Yeah, all
but a few spots upstairs.

They won't be hard to fix.

You're insane.
The cellar's the safest place.

I'm telling you,
they can't get in here.

And I'm telling you those things
turned over our car.

Now, you tell me
they can't get through

this lousy pile of wood?

REPORTER: <i>...is indeed spread
across the nation</i>

<i>and it's [indistinct]</i>

His wife and kid's downstairs,
the kid's hurt.

we're better off up here.

We could strengthen
everything up, Mr. Cooper.

With all of us working,

we could fix this place up
in no time.

We have everything
we need up here.

We can take
all that stuff downstairs.

Man, you are really crazy,
you know that?

You got a million windows
up here.

You're gonna make them
strong enough

to keep these things out, huh?

I told you, those things
don't have any strength.

I smashed three and pushed
another one out the door.

HARRY: Did you hear me?

I told you
they turned over our car.

Oh, hell, any good
five men could do that.

That's my point.

Only there's not gonna be
five or even ten.

There's gonna be 20, 30,
maybe a hundred of those things.

This place is gonna be
crawling with them.

Well, if there's that many,

they'll probably get us
wherever we are.

Look, the cellar.

There's just one door, right?

Just one door.

That's all we have to protect.

Tom and I fixed it,
so it locks

and boards from the inside.

TOM: You got a point,
Mr. Cooper.

But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

I mean, if they did get in,
there'd be no back exit.

We'd be done for.

We can get out of here
if we have to.

And we got windows to see
what's going on outside.

But down there, with no windows,
if a rescue did come,

we wouldn't even know it.

HARRY: But the cellar
is the strongest place.

BEN: The cellar
is a death trap.

TOM: I don't know, Mr. Cooper.
I think he's right.

HARRY: Look, you two can do
whatever you like.

I'm going back down
to the cellar

and I'm not gonna unlock it
again no matter what happens.

Now, wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.
No, I'm not gonna wait!

I've made my decision,
now you make yours.

TOM: I said, wait a minute!

Let's think about this.

We can make it to the cellar
if we have to.

If we decide to stay down there,
we'll need things from up here.

Let's at least consider it.

If you box yourself
in the cellar

and those things
get in the house,

you've had it.

At least up here,
you have a fighting chance.

Looks like about eight
or ten of them now.

That's more than there were.

There's a lot out back, too.

[monsters growling]




HELEN: Harry!

Harry, what's happening?

HARRY: It's all right!


[monster snarls]

[ominous music playing]



We gotta fix these boards.
Are you crazy?

Those things are gonna
be at every window

and every door in this place.

We've gotta get down
into the cellar.

Go down in your damn cellar
and get out of here!

I... I'm taking the girl with me.

Keep your hands off of her
and everything else up here.

If I stay up here, I'm fighting
for everything up here,

the radio and the food
is part of that.

The man's insane.
He's insane.

We've gotta
have food down there.

We've got a right.

BEN: Is this your house?
We've got a right!

You're going down there
with him?

Well, I...
BEN: Yes or no?

Listen, I've got
a kid down there.

She can't possibly
take those things,

smashing through the windows?

If you're stupid enough
to go die in that trap,

that's your business.

However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

It's tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

Now, get the hell down
in the cellar.

Go be boss down there.

I'm boss up here.

Bastards!

You know, I won't open
this door again, I mean it.

Mr. Cooper, with your help...

Let him go.
His mind's made up.

TOM: Wait a minute!

Judy?

Come on up here, honey.

You're gonna let them
get her, too?

It's all right, honey.
Go ahead.

Well, we're safe now.

It's boarded up tight.

What about Tom and Judy?

They wanna stay up there,
let 'em.

[metal clangs]

There are two other people
upstairs.

A man and a girl.

We heard the screaming.

HARRY: Yeah.

I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

Of course not, Harry.



Where did you get the bandage?

HELEN: Laundry in a basket.

I tore up a sheet.

[ominous music playing]

Let 'em stay upstairs.
Let 'em.

Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

We'll see who's right.

Yeah, we'll see,
when they come begging me

to let them in down here.
That's important, isn't it?

HARRY: What?
To be right,

everybody else to be wrong.

HARRY: What do you mean by that?

Does anyone up there know
why we're being attacked?

Whatever it is,
it isn't just happening here.

It's some kind of mass murder.

It's going on everywhere.

The radio said to stay inside...

Radio?

HARRY: There's a radio upstairs.

I heard the news bulletin.

There's a radio upstairs
and you boarded us in

down here?
HARRY: I know what I'm doing.

What did it say?
HARRY: Nothing! Nothing.

They don't know anything yet.

People are supposed to look
for a safe place to hide.

Take the board off that door!

We are staying down here, Helen!

Harry, that radio
is at least some communication.

If the authorities know
what's happening,

they'll send people or, or,
or tell us what to do.

How are we gonna know if we lock
ourselves in this dungeon?

[ominous music playing]

We may not enjoy
living together,

but dying together
isn't going to solve anything.

Those people aren't our enemies.

TOM: Mr. Cooper!
Mr. Cooper,

Ben found a television set
upstairs.

HELEN: Tom?
TOM: Yeah?

HELEN: If Judy comes down
for a few minutes,

Harry and I can come up.

Nothing's gonna get done
with them down there

and us up here.

Do this, for me.

Okay.
Okay, open up.

[door creaking]

JUDY: I'll take
good care of her, Helen.

She's all I have.

[ominous music playing]

Her brother was killed.

BEN: Hey! Give me
a hand with this thing.

I, I gotta help Ben
with the television.


Oh, don't be afraid of me.

I'm Helen Cooper, Harry's wife.

HARRY: This place is ridiculous.

There's a million
weak spots up here.

And they talk
about these windows.

I can't see a damn thing.

There could be 15 million
of those things out there.

That's how much
good these windows are.

[Tom grunting]

Drag a couple
of those chairs together.

REPORTER: <i>However,
the reports...</i>

It's on!
It's on!

REPORTER: <i>[indistinct] reports,
incredible as they seem,</i>

<i>are not the results
of mass hysteria.</i>

"Mass hysteria."

What do they think,
we're imagining all this?

BEN: Shut up!

REPORTER: This is
the latest disclosure

from National Civil Defense
headquarters in Washington.

<i>Civil Defense machinery
has been organized</i>

<i>to provide rescue
stations with food,</i>

shelter, medical treatment,
and protection

by armed National Guardsmen...

We have that truck.

If we can get some gas,
we can get outta here.

There's a pump outside.

I know.

That's why I pulled in here,
but it's locked.

Why are space experts
being consulted

about an earthbound
emergency?

So far, all the betting
on the answer

to that question centers
on the recent explorer

satellite shot to Venus.

It's obvious. Our best move
is to try to get out of here.

HARRY: How are you gonna get over to that pump?
Look!

REPORTER: <i>You're coming from
a meeting regarding the</i>

<i>explosion of the Venus probe,
is that right?</i>

MAN 1: Uh, yes.
MAN 2: Yes, yes,

that was the subject
of the meeting.

REPORTER: <i>Do you feel
there is a connection</i>

<i>between this
and the phenomenon?</i>

There's a definite connection,
a definite connection.

REPORTER: <i>In other words,
you feel</i>

<i>that the radiation
on the Venus probe</i>

<i>is enough
to cause these mutations?</i>

MAN 1: <i>Just a minute.</i>

<i>I'm not sure
that that's certain at all.</i>

REPORTER: <i>Well,
it is the military's view</i>

<i>that the radiation
is not the cause</i>

<i>of the mutation.</i>

We're, we're doing
everything possible to,

to solve the problem.

REPORTER: <i>Stay tuned
to the broadcasting stations</i>

<i>in your local area for this
list of rescue stations.</i>

BEN: We've heard
all we need to know.

We have to try to get out
of here.

He said the rescue stations
have doctors

and medical supplies.

If we can get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

We have one
of the world's authorities

on space sciences
and technology.

BEN: Willard.
I saw a sign that said Willard.

TOM: It's only about
17 miles from here.

You know this area.

Yeah, Judy and I
are both from here.

We were on our way to the lake
when we heard the reports.

And we knew this house was here
and then these people came

and we went into the basement.

How could we possibly get away?

We've got three men, two women,
a sick child,

and another woman out
of her head.

And the place is surrounded
by those things.

Dr. Grimes is a special
consultant for NASA.

Dr. Grimes,
your entire staff,

I know, has been working
very hard to find some solution

to these things
that are happening.

Do you have any answers
at this time?

We have some answers,

but let me stress
the importance of seeking

medical attention for anyone
who's been injured.

<i>We don't know what
complications might result</i>

<i>from these injuries.</i>

It has been established...
How bad has your kid been hurt?

Um, she...

Tell Judy to come up here
so you can stay

with your kid, all right?

DR. GRIMES: <i>Destructive action
taken with regard</i>

<i>to the Venus probe.</i>

In the cold room
at the university,

we had a cadaver,
a cadaver from which all

four limbs
had been amputated.

This morning,
it opened its eyes.

It was dead, but it opened
its eyes and tried to move.

They want you upstairs.

I'll come back down
as soon as I find out

what they want.

Thank you, Judy.

The bodies
should be disposed of at once,

preferably by cremation.

Well, how long after death then

does the body become
reactivated?

It's only a matter of minutes.

Minutes?

That doesn't leave much time
to make arrangements.

No, you're right.
It doesn't give them time

to make funeral arrangements.

The bodies must be carried
to the street and,

and, and
burned immediately.

Soak them with gasoline
and burn them.

<i>It has been established that...</i>

Judy, I need you to find sheets
to tear into small strips, okay?

Okay.
We need some bottles or jars

to make Molotov cocktails.

Hey! There's a big can
of kerosene down there.

JUDY: I'll see
what I can find.

I'll look for bottles.

There's, uh, uh,
a big key ring down there.

The key to the gas pump may
be on it.

TOM: I'll check.

We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

Meantime, some of us can go out
and try to get the gas,

and then we can come back
for the rest of the people.

That'll leave
a door open someplace.

BEN: Yeah, that's right.
This door.

It's closer to the truck.

We'll put some supplies
behind the cellar door.

While we're gone, the rest
of you can hole up in there.

I found some jars
and there's a key on here

that's labeled
for the gas pump out back.

I'm not really
that used to the truck.

I found it abandoned.

I can handle the truck,
no sweat.

You're it, then.
You and I will go.

REPORTER: <i>Will come back
to life to seek human victims,</i>

<i>unless their bodies are
first disposed of by cremation.</i>

BEN: You can go upstairs
and toss the cocktails

from a window.

After we get the gas and back
into the house,

then we'll worry about getting
everybody into the truck.

REPORTER: <i>No place to flee
for safety,</i>

<i>except for the rescue stations
which have been set up.</i>

Indications are that
before this emergency is over,

we will need many,
many more such rescue stations.

That's all for now.

Stay tuned to this channel.

We'll be back live at 3:00 AM.

Stay safe out there.

[ominous music playing]

[footsteps approaching]

You always have
that smile for me.

How can you smile
like that all the time?

Okay.
How many do you have done?

Tom, are you sure
about the phone?

The phone is dead.

If I could only call the folks.

They're going to be
so worried about us.

Everything's gonna be okay.

As soon as we get to Willard,

we'll call them.
They might even be there.

Tom, are you sure
we're doing the right thing?

What, about getting out
of here?

Yeah.

Well, the television
said we've got to get

to a rescue station.

I don't know.
Oh, come on.

You're starting
to sound like Mr. Cooper now.

But why do you have
to go out there?

Because I know
how to handle that truck

and I can handle the pump.

Ben doesn't know anything
about that stuff.

But we're safe in here.

We're safe now.

But there's gonna be more
and more of those things.

JUDY: I know all that.


Remember when we had
the big flood?

Remember how difficult
it was for us to convince you

that it was right to leave?

This isn't a passing thing.

We've got to do something
and fast.

I just don't want you
to go out there, that's all.

[dramatic music playing]

Hey, smile, honey.

Where's that big smile for me?

HARRY: We better get her
downstairs.

We have to go
downstairs now, Barbara.

She's right.
We have to go downstairs.

Just for a little while,
then we can all leave.

Oh, I'd like to leave.

Yes.

[ominous music playing]

Good luck.
Yeah.

[bottles clinks]




[dramatic music playing]

[bottles clinking]

You ready upstairs?

HARRY: Yeah.

Okay. Toss them!

Go ahead!
Go. Go!

Get back in the cellar!

I'm going.


If you're coming, come on.
Get in.


[dramatic music playing]

[zombie snarling]

[slams on roof]

Come on.
The keys don't work.


Watch the torch!

[dramatic music playing]

We've gotta get away
from the pump!

Just hang on.

Tom!
Get out of the truck.

[dramatic music playing]

Oh...

Come on.
Let's get outta here.

Come on.
Come on!

JUDY: My jacket's caught.

Tom, help me!



[zombies snarling]


[dramatic music playing]

BEN: Cooper!
Let me in.

Cooper!

Cooper!

Let me in.

I wanna drag you out there
and feed you to those things!

Isn't it 3:00 yet?

There's supposed to be
another broadcast at 3:00.

HARRY: Ten minutes.

Oh.

Only ten more minutes?

We don't have very long to wait.

We can leave

or we better leave soon.

It's 10 minutes to 3:00.

You know anything
about this area at all?

Is Willard the nearest town?

I don't know.

We were... [sighs]

just trying to get to a motel
before dark.

You said those things
turned over your car.

You think we can get it back
on its wheels?

Where is it?
Forget it.

It's at least a mile.

Johnny has the keys.

You're gonna carry
that child a mile

through that army of things
out there?

I can carry the kid.

What's wrong with her?
How did she get hurt?

One of those things grabbed her.

Bit her on the arm.

What's wrong?
Who knows what diseases

those things carry?

Is she conscious?
Barely.

She can't walk.
She's too weak.

Well, one of us could try
to get to the car.

You're gonna turn it over
by yourself?

You can't start the car.
Johnny has the keys.

BEN: You have a car?

Where? Where is it?

You won't be able to start it.

BEN: Yeah. Yeah. I know.

Where is it?
[clatters]

[ominous music playing]

HARRY: Good lord.

News cameras have just returned

from a search and destroy
operation.

This one conducted
by Sheriff Conan McClelland

in Butler County, Pennsylvania.

<i>All law enforcement agencies
and the military</i>

<i>have been organized
to search out</i>

<i>and destroy
the marauding ghouls.</i>

<i>A ghoul can be killed
by a shot in the head</i>

<i>or a heavy blow to the skull.</i>

<i>Officials are quoted
as explaining</i>

<i>that since the brain
of a ghoul has been activated</i>

<i>by the radiation,</i>

<i>kill the brain
and you kill the ghoul.</i>

Chief McClelland,
how's everything going?

Oh, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.

You wanna get on the other side
of the road over there.

Chief, do you think we'll be
able to defeat these things?

Well, we killed 19 of them today
right in this area.

Those last three we caught
trying to claw their way

into an abandoned shed.

They must have thought
somebody was in there.

There wasn't though.

We heard them making
all kinds of noise.

We came over and beat them off,

blasted them down.
OFFICER: Chief,

as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?

Yeah, okay.
Chief, if I were surrounded

by six or eight of these things,

would I stand a chance
with them?

Well, there's no problem.

If you had a gun,
shoot them in the head.

That's a sure way to kill them.

If you don't,
get yourself a club

or a torch.
Beat them or burn them.

They go up pretty easy.
Well, Chief McClelland,

how long do you think it'll take

until you get the situation
under control?

Well, that's pretty hard to say.

When we find them,
we can kill them.

We'll be at it
most of the night,

probably into the early morning.

We're working our way to Willard
and we'll team up

with the National Guard
over there,

then we'll be able to give
a more definite view.

Is the fuse box in the cellar?

[zombies growling]

It isn't the fuse,
the power lines are down.

Helen?

I have to get that gun.

Haven't you had enough?

Two people are dead already
because of that guy.

Look out the window.
[zombies growling]

[ominous music playing]


[glass shatters]



[zombies growling]

Get over here, man!

Come on!

HARRY: Go ahead. Go ahead.

You wanna stay up here now, huh?

Helen, get in the cellar.

I said get in the cellar, now!

Move!
[grunting]

[gunshot]
[grunts]

[gasps, screams]

[grunts]
[growling]



[heart beating]



[zombies growling]


Karen.

Karen.


Karen.

Oh, my goodness.

Karen, oh, no. [crying]

Oh, my poor baby.

[gasps, grunts]

[suspenseful music playing]



No! No!

No! Johnny, no!

No!
[zombies growling]

No! Johnny!


[zombies growling]

[grunts]

[pounding on door]

[zombies growling]

[ominous music playing]





[birds chirping]

[bird cowing]

[helicopter blades whirring]

[indistinct radio chatter]

Hey, Vince!

You wanna get about four,
five men and a couple dogs?

There's a house over there
behind those trees.

We wanna go check it out.

You still here, Bill?

Yeah, Chief,
we're going to stay with it

until we meet up
with the National Guard.

Where did you get coffee?
One of the volunteers.

You're doing all the work,
you take it.

Thank you.
We should be wrapped up here

about three or four more hours,

we'll probably get
into Willard's end.

I guess you can go over there

and meet the National Guard.

Nick, you and the rest
of these men wanna come with me?

[dogs barking]


[helicopter blades whirring]

CONAN: They need you down there
by the barn.

You guys can follow
the wagon down.

I only need a few men
to check out the house.

Somebody had a cookout here,
Vince.

Sure looks like it, Con.

[zombie groans]
[gunshots]

[zombie groaning]
[gunshots]


He's a dead one. Get up here.

Nick, Tony, Steve,

you wanna get out in that field
and build me a bonfire?

[door creaking]

[ominous music playing]

Drag that out of here
and throw it on the fire.

Nothing down here.
All right.

Go ahead down
and give 'em a hand.

Let's go check out the house.

There's something in there.

I heard a noise.

All right, Vince.
Hit him in the head.

Right between the eyes.
[gunshot]


Good shot.

Okay, he's dead.
Let's go get him.

That's another one for the fire.

[dramatic music playing]

[indistinct radio chatter]

MAN 1: Have we located the boy?

CONAN: And that's his mother
up there, right?

MAN 2: There's more down
in the cellar.

[indistinct radio chatter]

MAN 3: <i>All right.
In the wagon, sir.</i>

MAN 1: Chief, there might be
something to look at over here.

MAN 4: <i>Hey, keep those dogs
off those things.</i>

MAN 5: You might wanna move
her back a little bit,

we're gonna bring him up there.
MAN 4: <i>Yeah, we're gonna need</i>

<i>some extra hooks in here, over.</i>

MAN 5: Careful,
we gotta pile them on there.

I need someone to give me
a hand with this one.

MAN 6: <i>Roger,
we're still in the house over.</i>

[helicopter blades whirring]

MAN 7: [indistinct] another
waste of good shovels although.

You got a light?

MAN 8: Here, I got you.

MAN 7: The coffee's still
warm though

if you wanna get some more.
MAN 8: Yeah.

MAN 7: Here's your coffee.
MAN 9: Yeah, not bad,

<i>This house really

MAN 8: <i>Three.</i>

MAN 9: <i>How big, look at that.</i>

[dramatic music playing]

MAN 1: <i>Got you.</i>

MAN 2: <i>Sure does.</i>

[dog barking]

[upbeat music playing]

[dramatic music playing]

[dog barking]

[dramatic music playing]

[dramatic music playing]

MAN 1: <i>How's your sleep
last night?</i>

MAN 2: <i>Not too bad.</i>
MAN 3: <i>Yeah. Pretty good.</i>

MAN 1: <i>You want a cigarette?</i>
MAN 2: <i>Yeah.</i>

MAN 3: <i>Y'all take one too.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Shame the football team ain't
gonna be as good this year.</i>

MAN 2: <i>Yeah.
I was thinking the same thing.</i>

MAN 1:
<i>Lost a lot of good players.</i>

<i>Now, watch your shoes
over there.</i>

MAN 2: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

[dog barking]
[gunshots]

MAN 1: <i>Uh, I have a question
for you, Jim.</i>

JIM: <i>Uh-hmm.</i>
MAN 1: <i>Um...</i>

<i>Marjory's car is pulling
to the left.</i>

JIM: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

MAN 1: <i>You take
tire pressure first?</i>

JIM: <i>Yeah, of course.
All right.</i>

MAN 1: <i>But I just...
I know I need some line</i>

<i>but just not...</i>
JIM: <i>Yeah.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Who'd you...
who'd you go to?</i>

MAN 2: <i>Would you do that
yourself?</i>

MAN 1: <i>Yeah. It's not easy.</i>

<i>He's got jacked up [indistinct]</i>

MAN 2: <i>Yeah.</i>
MAN 1: <i>...go underneath.</i>

<i>There's a... there's a bolt

MAN 2: <i>Get yourself

<i>you got a lot of that, do you?</i>
MAN 1: <i>Uh-hmm.</i>

MAN 2: <i>Yeah.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Oh, man,

MAN 2: <i>Sure does.</i>
MAN 4: <i>That'll burn your eyes.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Just watch
the wind direction.</i>

MAN 2: <i>You suppose
that's the hair or the flesh.</i>

MAN 4: <i>I'm just trying
not to think about it too,</i>

<i>truth be told.</i>

MAN 1: <i>It's a good combination.
All of it.</i>

MAN 2: <i>Because I burn
my hair sometimes</i>

<i>and it stinks pretty awful.</i>
MAN 1: <i>Yeah.</i>

<i>It's got that, uh,
barbeque sandwich a little bit.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Yeah. You got like
a bandana or something</i>

<i>I can cover my nose with?</i>
MAN 2: <i>No I don't.</i>

MAN 4: <i>I've got handkerchief,
there you go.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Yeah. Thanks.</i>
MAN 2: <i>It ain't clean,</i>

<i>but you can use it.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Cigarette too helps

[ominous music playing]

[dramatic music playing]

[dog howling]

MAN 1: <i>We'll see here
what happens then.</i>

MAN 2: <i>Yeah.</i>
MAN 1: <i>It turns out</i>

<i>this robot thing has been
controlling everything.</i>

MAN 2: <i>Yeah.</i>
MAN 1: <i>Yeah.</i>

MAN 2: <i>And he's got this voice,

<i>it's like, "Dave."</i>
MAN 1: <i>Dave.</i>

MAN 2: <i>"Oh, Dave."</i>
MAN 1: <i>All right.</i>

<i>And it's like...
to talk to him, huh?</i>

MAN 2: <i>Yeah. And he's...
and he's [indistinct]</i>

<i>so he think he's a real person,
you know, after a while.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.</i>

<i>Thinks he's a real person
or he's actually thinking...</i>

MAN 2: <i>Anyway, at the end,
he's an embryo.</i>
