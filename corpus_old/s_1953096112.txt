Clifton Hangar,
"Revolver Magazine."

I know who you are.

I'm glad you finally...

granted this interview.

I... appreciate you
trusting me with this.

Mind if I record this?

Knock yourself out.

Thanks, Spyder.

Thanks.

So what have you been
doing with yourself

for the past 20 years?

If you're gonna ask stupid
fucking questions, kid,

this will be the shortest
interview of your career.

We both know
why you're here.

You're on the inside.

So why don't we just get on
with it, huh?

Eric Genson.

This...

bullshit about
a third record.

So there really is
no third Soulz record?

Who was Eric Genson?

Where do you
want me to start?

Maybe the beginning
of the end, huh?

Okay.

Let's try it
one more time.

Except let's try it
a bit...

sotto voce.

Three and four and...

Have a nice day,
Mr. Genson.

They sound great.

I remember playing
that same shit song

in this classroom about
15 years ago.

Best part about
playing those plastic dildos

was lining them up on the curb
at the end of the year

and... smashing them.

Do you remember that?

Why are you here?

What kind of a welcome home
is that, huh?

Huh?

You mind?

Go for it.

See...

I travel 3,000 miles,

this is the kind of
welcome I get.

Eric?

Eric?

Hey!

Girl: Thanks, Mr. Rivers.

Eric!

Hold up for a second.

Why don't we...

We'll go out and we'll get
hammered like old times, huh?

I can't, I'm working.

What are you doing here?
Come on, get out of here.

What's going on here,
Mr. Genson?

Spyder...
Nothing, he was just leaving.

Can I have an
autograph, please?

Excuse me, can I help
you with something?

Yeah, I do believe you can.

What'd you
have in mind?

Herman...
oh, my God.

I'll see you at
the staff meeting.

Yes, you will.

Don't you want to
keep me after school?

I always liked detention.

Hey, where...
Oh, God.

Eric!

Good to see you,
too, bro.

So this used to be
considered punk?

Yeah, I guess.

I don't know.

I was wandering if you'd
sign my Soulz poster for me?

Absolutely.

By the way, you've, uh,

blossomed into
a... fucking hot chick.

Yeah, thanks.

I mean,
it's been what, like...

Seven years.

Hey!
Hey!

Big-time rock star doesn't
have a fancier place

to dine this evening?

Hey, Stove Top Stuffing.

Eric, of course
I'm staying.

Great.

So... what
brings you back?

I missed this guy.

And, of course,
your amazing cooking.

Liza.

Well, we all missed
you around here.

Oh, shit.

Hello.

Hey.

No, uh...

Why are you in
a tow truck?

Yeah.

Because it's the suburbs...
I don't know.

No, no, no,
the Vette's parked out front.

Just keep going.

Keep going.

Perfect.

This is the last time
you do this to me.

I've had it already,
Spyder.

I want to
get back to LA.

Next time, I take the car

and you can hitch a ride with
the village idiot, okay?

Rose Atropos.

Manager of The Lost Soulz.

Come sit.

Well.

I'm Liza.
Nice to meet you.

Oh, come on.

Welcome!

Can I get you
something to eat?

Just coffee.

Black,
would be awesome.

I was gonna take Rose here
to the old chill spot.

Remember the pier?

I thought we could,
uh, catch up, yeah?

DJ: Hey, this is Roger Luce
hanging out with you.

WBAB Babylon.

We thank everyone in Syosset
for showing the world

they love rock and roll.

Hey, Eric!
Spyder?

What are you doing?
Relax.

Hey!

Wow!

Asshole.

Pretty hot piece
of ass, huh?

Hey.

Yeah, we're here.

So your dad's car still
fucking moves, huh?

God.

How many beers do you think
we drank out here, huh?

Figure 24 times...

Remember that pizza kid
we used to pay 20 bucks

to deliver a
$10-case to your house?

Fucking thief.

Always had money though from
playing shows, right?

Yeah, we did.

Yeah, you remember that?

We were gonna
buy a VW bus

and drive to
LA with our demo.

Support ourselves playing
shows along the way.

You wanted to do that
bullshit Route 66 trip

all the way to
California.

Rock and roll's the bastard
son of the blues, man.

Yeah.

So you been playing?

Sometimes.

With who?

A few guys here and there...
you don't know 'em.

"A few guys
here and there."

Bullshit!

You haven't been playing
with anybody but yourself

in that piss-ass little
basement of yours.

Here we go.

What?
What is this?

What's going on?

We're hanging out now?

What do you want?

We are... making
a third Soulz record.

We need a guitarist.

The plane leaves
for LA tomorrow.

We start recording
in two weeks.

I knew it.

You knew it?
Knew what?

So what happened?

You milked and twisted our
demo for all it was worth

and now you need me to write
some more songs for you?

God!
Huh?

You're still on that fucking

musical high horse
of yours, huh?

I'm giving you
a fucking chance, Eric.

I'm throwing you a bone.
Oh.

Well, I just said no.

By the way,
is "Hot Cross Buns"

considered a blues classic?

Yeah.

You have until
tomorrow to decide.

"Snake Oil" was
the biggest-selling debut

rock album of all time.

Did you steal
those songs?

Good artists... copy.

The great artists
steal.

Some of the greatest
rock songs of all time,

they were stolen.

Plucked from obscurity.

Made immortal, even.

Your point?

Without me, none of those
songs would have...

They would have stayed
locked in that basement.

Chip was dead 20 years
when I got back.

He needed to
get the fuck over it.

It sounds like you spent
a lot of time in that house.

What about you?

Did you know Chip,
were you a fan?

I knew him.

We were seven
when he died.

Of course, I'm a fan.

Who hasn't been
influenced by the Hawks?

I mean, I suppose it's
different, though,

when the guitar hero banging
dope is your old man.

# Ain't no finer
boy in town #

# You're my guy just
what the doctor ordered #

# Taste so sweet you make
my mouth water #

# I want candy #

Goddamn it, Chip.

Young man...

Come on, come on.

Oh, fuck, wait,
hold on.

Eric?

Oh, shit.

Hey, Eric, what's up?

Eric?

Can you help me out,
please?

Come on, man, please.

Everybody out!

Every fucking time.

Clear out of here!

Ladies and gentlemen,
The Hawks!

Hello, New York!

He's come for you,
hasn't he?

When are you leaving?

Look at that face,
huh?

Will you be
all right?

She'll be fine, Eric.

All right.

Well... see you, kid.

Look who's here.

Let's go, Teach.

Let's get out of here.

Oh, and I'm not wearing any
of that fucking makeup.

Why are you here?

You didn't tell him.

Tell him what?

Uh, Spyder,
you remember Augie, right?

Yeah, yeah, so what?

He's driving.

I'm sorry... Driving?

Are you fucking kidding me?
Yeah.

You want your record,
we take that trip.

What?

You need my songs.

We do it my way
or we don't do it at all.

Route 66.

Fuck, this is
ridiculous.

Back up, back up.

What do you mean by
"a change of plans"?

I'm coming out,
I'm coming out.

What?

Surprise.

What the fuck
is this?

Get in.
Get in?

I thought you said
you could get this guy.

We do get this guy,
all right?

Come here, come here,
come here,

come here, come here...

Have you fucking
lost your mind?

We have to be at the airport,
Spyder, in one hour.

One hour!

And the limo's
on it's way.

No airports,
no nothing, okay?

This is our fucking limo.

That's funny.

What is that
piece of shit?

I'm not getting in that
piece of shit.

What the fuck do you
want me to do, Rose?

You're fucking crazy!

What the fuck do you want me
to do, okay?

We have two weeks,
we have no songs.

What do you
want me to do?

All right, ladies.

In three notes, can you
name this tune?

Spyder, who is this guy?

Don't ask.

We were traveling west
in a covered wagon

across the country.

I played
Madison Square Garden,

for fuck's sake, you know.

And Rose...

was pissed.

I mean, you got
August West at the wheel

and the prospect of this great
adventure before you.

Fuck adventure.

I needed a record's worth
of songs...

in two weeks,

or the record label
was gonna... drop me.

And where does this
clown take us?

Hey, Eric, wait a second.

Oh, my God.

I've, uh...

Wow.

Waited, uh...

waited a long time
for this.

A long time.

Holy shit, Augie.
Really.

It's in tune.

Yeah.

Oh, man.

What's this?
What?

It's Vicodin.

Don't go through
my shit, man.

Are you fucking
kidding me?

Are you kidding me?!
What's the big deal, man?

Careful!

You're not my
fucking dad, okay?

No, I'm not your
fucking father.

I...

I just can't
do this again.

It's not that
big of a deal.

It's under control, man.

Fuck!

Jesus Christ!
God, man.

How about another beer, guys?

It's on me.

Come on,
you want a shot?

Have a shot.
Thanks, darling.

What'll it be, honey?

Have a shot of whiskey.

Coming right up.

What are you
guys doing here?

I don't know,
ask him.

Yo, where the fuck
are we anyway?

Scranton.

Look at this fucking place.

Yo, man, can this guy
even fucking play?

One time me and my three
friends stole my mom's car

to go see these guys at
The Spectrum in Philly.

We had to drive
the whole way

in January
with the windows open

because the damn car had
a leaky gas line.

We nearly
froze our asses off.

Cool.

Can I get another?

Who's the new guy?

He's hot.

Can I meet him?
Sure.

Fuck!

Been one of those days?

It's been
one of those years.

Yeah, yeah, that's it.

Like that.
Cool.

Just follow me.

# It's goin' down #

# In Tinseltown #

# Circus is here #

# Children gather around #

# We were lost #

# But everybody's found
tonight #

# Go get the girls #

# In black and pearls #

# Drivin' daddy's Jag
to the top of the world #

# Down in the valley #

# The stars will never shine
so bright #

# Every neon night
burns away #

# Everything's so cold

# Turn me on #

# Turn me on #

# Like a neon light

Ow!

# Every neon night #

# Burns away #

# Turn me on #

# Turn me on #

# Like a neon light #

# Turn me on #

# Turn me on #

# Like a neon light #

# That never
fades away ##

That's how those songs
were meant to be played.

That was fucking
awesome, man.

I knew the second Eric
played that ukulele of his

that Rose would swoon like
a little schoolgirl.

It was always
like that.

He could play one note

and get all the sweet
young things he wanted.

They'd line up,

drop their pretty
little panties for him.

You loved her?

Who?

Rose.

Please.

She was just another
hot piece of ass.

Don't print that.

Yeah...

All right, girls, time for
our favorite road game.

Name it.

"You Don't Have To Be A Star
(To Be In My Show)."

Marilyn McCoo
and Billy Davis, Jr.

# You don't have to be
a star baby #

Perfect.

# To be in my show #

Oh, your show?
Yeah.

Now we have the fucking
"Donny and Marie Show."

# You don't have to be
a star baby #

Oh, I used to
love this song.

Yeah, yeah,
not anymore, obviously.

Where the fuck
are we?

Ohio.

What the fuck's in Ohio?

There's a farm.

Breakfast.

Breakfast.

No, no, no, this is
a fucking truck stop.

They got great showers,
though.

You want a token?

No, thank you.

You could use
a shower, dude.

How are those eggs?

Cold.

Well, hot damn.

I feel like a bright
new shiny penny.

So what's the plan,
Augie?

The plan is I'm tired
and I want a rest

so I'm gonna
go back to the RV.

And what the fuck are we
supposed to do, huh?

Well, they have a groovy
video-game-room thing.

And go play some
Space Invaders

or Planetoids
or hemorrhoids.

I suppose you have tokens
for that, too?

No, you're on your own.

I would light
that ass up, I'll tell ya.

Millstone.

Hey, Ace, it's Rose, hi.

I can barely
hear you.

Where are you?

You were supposed to be
back here days ago

with that
fucking money pit

you call a band.

Yep, we're actually...
we're on the road now.

So, um, we'll be heading
back to you shortly.

In two weeks
I wash my hands of you

and that cokehead boyfriend
of yours.

He's not my boyfriend.
Whatever.

It's been over a year.

Where's my fucking songs?

You will have
your songs.

Two weeks!

Two weeks!

Bye.

Goddamn truck-stop food,
huh?

You're great.

I spoke to Ace.

And?

And he's
a fucking asshole.

If we don't get back to LA,

get in the studio
with some songs,

we can kiss the fucking
record deal good-bye,

the advance good-bye...
everything, okay?

We're done, finished.

You don't think
I fucking know this?

Why the fuck do you think
I'm dragging your ass

all the way
across the country?

Hey.

Rosie?

Hey.

I mean, I already brought
you back to that

godforsaken place,
and what do we get, huh?

This.

Fucking beautiful.

Good morning,
my little pretties.

You're melting,
you're melting.

Ah, here come
our fellow travelers.

Fireworks, baby.

Yeah, load up, guys.

We gotta get to
Chicago.

What the fuck's in Chicago?

Chicago is where
Route 66 begins.

Ta-da!

Let's load 'em up.

Truck stops.

Fucking Route 66.

Now we got...
"Name That Tune."

Are you fucking
kidding me?

Fuck!

By the way, how's your
writing going, maestro?

Lovebirds.

You fucking
make me sick!

Whoa.

Route 66 was officially
taken off the map in 1985.

I was on this dysfunctional
family road trip

headed to a road that
didn't even exist anymore.

He telling me we chose
our own fate.

Our destiny.

Come on.

All right, my pretties.

It's time for
our favorite game.

No, no, no.

We're not playing this
fucking game anyone!

You know what?

Try me one more time,
try me.

Okay, hold on,
hold on, here we go.

Um...

Professor Rock up here.

Shut the fuck up!

Shut up!
Come on, man, get it right!

Get one right!
We're waiting, Professor.

Fuck, I know this one.

Um...

Neil Young,
that's who it is.

It's Neil Young.

Whatever,
fuck your game.

Don't you know any music,
Spyder?

It's America.

I'm sorry, Rose,
I'm sorry.

I should have
fucking known that.

It's America.

My dial's not tuned in to
the adult contemporary version

of my fucking stereo.

I'm really sorry.

Oh, adult
contemporary music.

Whoa.
He got you, Augie.

That's pretty heavy.

Hey, Spyder.

It's America!

Check it out.

I always seemed to end up
in the front seat

next to that guy.

Looking back,
I don't really know

what I was searching for
up there.

Make a right up here.

Why?

'Cause I'm not sleeping in
this piece-of-shit RV again.

Oh, whatever you want,
little lady.

What, do you
want a shot?

Two best friends
right here.

So, um, what... what...

So what about
this chick?

Have you seen Spyder?

No, not since
we checked in.

I'm gonna play this song
for him.

What the fuck
are you looking at?

Huh?

You and your "everything's
gonna be okay" happy pills.

What are you up to now,
like 20 a day?

How long have you had
that habit, huh, Eric?

So what, I do a little blow
every now and then.

Get fucking over it!

Quit looking
at me like that!

I'm... I just wanted to play
you the new song

I was working on, but...

Fuck.

Fuck.

Where's Spyder?

Uh, he's busy.

Fuck him, come on.

Look at yourself.

Broken, mangled.

You freak.

Not now, not now.

Leave me
the fuck alone!

He was right.

You are a loser.

You never
amounted to shit.

Fuck off!

You missed.

My face...

My skull...

No talent, no family,
no friends.

I have friends.

I have friends.

Oh, yeah?

Why don't you name one

that you haven't stabbed in
the back or fucked over.

It's okay, I'll wait.

Where do you think
you're going?

Uh...

No?

Hey... hey, man,
you wanna...

you want to get down from
there so we can talk?

What are you
doing, man?

It's all right, man.

Come...

I went to go see him
when I was at home.

Easy, man.

I couldn't do it.

I couldn't do it.

I got this for
my 18th birthday.

Pops decided to toast life
on my face that night.

Over there
by those stairs.

So you're estranged
from your parents?

He's dead.

The only thing he gave me
was this, uh...

...beautiful face
and this house.

I never
knew my mother.

She was, um...

smart enough to get out.

She left when I was...
when I was...

What the fuck is this?

This is why
I don't do interviews.

Don't...

Don't print any of this.

We're supposed to be
talking about

the road trip and Eric.

How about we talk about
the third album?

Fuck!
Where is it?

Enough.

You're wasting my time.

You're wasting
your time on...

...on this for
ten years.

Oh, am I wasting
your time?

Huh?

Where were we?

Shoot!

Thank God.

Hand me the eight-track,
please.

What?

The eight-track.

What the fuck is this?

It's an antique.

It's a fucking
classic, man.

Shit.

Dorkwad.

Guess Who.

I already told you,
I'm not playing this

fucking game anymore.

No, the band
Guess Who.

Come on, man.

Come on!
Come on!

Come on,
I'll show you mine!

Come on!
Come on!

Come on!
Yeah!

Whoo!

Whoo!

Yeah, rock and roll!

Fuck you!

You know your music.

Uh, yeah, why do you
sound so surprised?

Oh, I took you
for one of those

could-be, wanna-be
record producers,

arrangers, managers...

know-nothing-about-music
types.

No offense.

All right, no,
that's interesting.

'Cause I, uh...

I kind of took you
as an over-the-hill,

really dirty old man

who has overstayed his welcome
in the industry

just a little too long,

and, you know, hangs out
with younger kids.

Catches a glimpse
of "T" and "A" when you can.

I mean, no offense.

No offense taken.

If I didn't love
the music, man...

I wouldn't be here.

Yeah.

What is he doing?

Spyder, what the fuck
are you doing?

What the fuck's
wrong with you?

Fuck you!
Fuck off!

Spyder!

Just having a bit
of fun.

That's not the fucking
Boy Scouts.

Pull over now!

So ridiculous.

You're a bunch of
fucking pansy-ass,

leather-wearing pussies!

Damn it!

Whoo!

Fuck you!

You're fucking
kidding me right now!

Suck my dick,
you fucking loser!

Cocksucker!

Whoo!

Fuck you!

Whoo!

Goddamn motherfucker!

Oh...

You're fucked!

Everybody get down!

Cocksucker!

Hang on!

What the fuck
are you thinking?

You're a moron,
grow up.

That's not
fucking funny, man.

Jesus Christ.

Oh, Eric, why don't you go
sit down and play guitar?

Oh, my God!

Augie, what are we
doing here?

Visiting.

Visiting who?

An old friend.

Here we go again!

Ah shit,
we're gonna die.

Augie, what's going on,
who lives here?

An old flame.

She loved me.

What's your business here,
motherfucker!

Well...

let's see how I can
rectify this.

It's me.

It's Augustus, Maggie.

Of course, I know it's you,
you rat bastard.

Why do you
think I'm firing?

I'd recognize that
piece-of-shit RV

in a trailer park
full of 'em.

Aw, come on.

Maggie, that's...
that's the peerless Rita.

She's a classic.

Uh, uh, now,
Maggie...

My little pearl of light.

"Pearl of light."

My ass!

What do you want
and need from me, Augie?

Don't tell me.

There's a band
in there.

And you want to,
like, you know... crash.

I'm not a cook.

Maggie,
it's the peerless Rita.

How could I fit a band
in there?

Please.

It's good to see
you again, Margaret.

You... bastard.

That's pretty rough,
Maggie.

You're really driving
across country

in that thing
with all these guys?

Yep.

It's not so bad, though.

They're all
a bunch of pussycats.

I've dealt with
much worse.

Haven't we all?

You got a window blown out
in my Airstream.

Now if you want to
entertain yourself

with a big rush
or even kill yourself,

do it on your own
fucking time.

What is this, huh?

Some kind of
intervention?

Once you've lightened up
on the sauce,

you think
the party's over, huh?

There's nothing worse than
a reformed whore.

Just don't violate
the cardinal rule,

and you'll be all right.

Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

So what's
the cardinal rule?

Never get your
emotions involved,

and they can't hurt you.

Oh, I know.

I know all about that.

Fucking waste of space.

What?

Would you lay off him?

He's driving us
across the country.

Are you fucking
kidding me?

You know what,
fuck you, I'm out of here.

Fuck you, too.

Asshole.

Spyder, where are
you going?

Just let him go.

I'm gonna go inside

so I can finish
working on this song.

Hey.

What you writing?

Just some song.

What's your song about?

Play it for me.

Are you scared?

Chip's kid.

Wow.
Yeah.

I remember running around
with you guys.

It was... just like
it was yesterday.

I think I'm really
falling for you.

Did you hear
what I said to you?

It's that Spyder dude.

Wow, he's a...

He's unpredictable.

You're calling someone
unpredictable.

Man, now you sound old.

It must have been really
cool growing up in...

...in your dad's house.

Well, it wasn't.

What?

Now, what are you
talking about?

Oh, man...

Your dad was
a punk-rock legend.

A legend?

Yeah, it's real hard to
play three fucking chords.

Three fucking chords?

Three fucking chords.

You're...

That was great music.

Look, I said I didn't want to
talk about it, okay?

Are you okay?

What's wrong?

Honey, what's wrong?

Eric?

Has anyone seen Spyder?

Oh, hey.

No, he, um...

he didn't come back.

All right,
I'm gonna go look for him.

You want to take
the truck?

Thanks.

Get in!

Fuck off!

What the fuck
is your problem?

I don't have a problem.

I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

Okay, fine.

You want to know what?

You want to know what
my fucking problem is?

Yeah, I do.
You, you.

You fucking Shanghai me,
my band.

Take me on this fucking
old-school road trip.

And for what, huh?

For your songs,
for your blessed songs.

Well, you know what,
fuck you.

I don't need your
fucking songs.

Oh, you don't?
I don't need them!

Somehow I think you do need
them, you fuck.

What was "Snake Oil," huh?

The biggest rock
debut album of all time.

Who wrote those
songs, huh?

Yeah, I wrote those songs.

So you put on some fucking
makeup and added a dance beat.

Don't... I wrote
those songs.

Those were my songs!

What difference
does it make, huh?

What difference
does it make?

You bitched out!

You bitched out!

You would've sat in that
fucking basement of yours

and done nothing
with it.

I took them,
I fucking made those songs.

I made them!

So what happened on your
second album?

With all of your
fucking songs, huh?

It sucked!

By all accounts!

Everyone hated it!
Fuck you, fuck you!

You didn't have my demo
to steal that from.

Did you?

And I never said anything!

You were on the cover of
every fucking magazine!

My songs were on
every radio station!

You didn't want to come!

You didn't want to
come with me!

You left me!

I... I would have gone.

Bullshit.

I would have!

I would have.

That's bullshit.

That is fucking bullshit.
No!

If you would have just waited,
I would have...

That is...

That is bullshit because your
mother would've never let you

fucking follow
in your dad's footsteps.

Are you kidding me?

She never let you five feet
away from her fucking titty!

What did you just
say to me?

Don't you fucking
talk about my dad

or my fucking mom!

Enough, enough!

Get in the fucking truck,
Herman.

Finally.

You're still a pussy.

I kicked your ass.

Are you two boys just gonna
stand there all night?

Why don't
you come on in,

get yourselves
a drink?

Hey.

What's up there, mama?

It's a nice place
you got here.

What can I get you?

Uh... shit,
I'm thinking beer.

Uh, Budweiser and
a shot of Jack.

Bud?
Yeah.

Uh...

Actually, I asked for...

Never mind.

So, this is
a blues joint, huh?

A real blues joint?

Mm-hmm.

If you really
want to hear the blues,

I mean, really hear
the blues,

you give this kid a guitar.

This guy lives
and breathes the blues.

The blues?

Is that so?

That's a fact.

Spyder.

No, don't listen to him.

Hey, Sonny Boy.

Yes, Ma'am?

You hear that?

He says this cat
can play us the blues.

Spyder,
what are you doing?

No, don't listen to him.

He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

I mean, look at him.

Payback's a bitch.

Three notes,
can you play that tune?

You know what, Miss Candy,

for some strange
reason,

I kind of... I kind of believe

this little
Frankenstein-looking white boy.

Thank you.

Asshole.

We got the blues
this morning!

That's good.

Can I get another one
of those?

Mr. Pinetop Perkins

got some blues
for you this morning.

You okay?

Yeah, what is that?

Oh, my God, dude.

Uh-oh.

All right,
here you go.

Let's see what you got.

Go on now.

What are you
boys doing in here?

Bring it with you
when you come, son.

Where you all from?

Uh...

Far, far away.

Thank you.

Hey, uh, Spyder.

Get up here, you're gonna
do it, too.

Nope.

Does anyone want that guy
to come up here and sing?

Oh, hell, yes.

Give him a chance.

No, no, no.

Let's see what
you can do, Spyder.

So, what the fuck
am I supposed to do, huh?

Uh...

It's okay, son.

Just like playing
with your friends.

Hey, uh...

"Train Kept A-Rollin"'?

Sweet, Aerosmith.

Aero-who?
Aerosmith?

What?
Tiny Bradshaw, homey.

All right, ready?

# Aboard a train #

# I met a dame #

# She kinda handsome #

# We kinda
looked the same #

# She was pretty #

# From New York City #

# Walking down
that lane #

# I'm in heat #

# I'm in love #

# But I just
couldn't tell her so #

They're all right.

Burn, baby, burn!

# I said the train
kept a-rollin' #

# All night long #

# I said the train
kept a-rollin' #

# All night long #

One more round.

# But I just couldn't
tell her no #

All right.

Yeah.

# I said the train
kept a-rollin' #

# All night long #

# I said the train
kept a-rollin' #

# All night long #

# I'm in heat #

# I'm in love ##

Did you see me?

Did that really
just happen?

Oh my God!

Hello!

Hi!

Uh-oh.

Where were you?

Huh?

I've been sitting here
all night.

Uh-oh.
Huh?

Looks like somebody's
got an old lady.

But you didn't
miss me, Rosie?

No, not at all, asshole.
No?

No.
Oh, no.

Fuck off.

What the fuck, Eric?

What, what are you...
What's going on?

I mean, what?
Yeah, yeah, uh...

I don't get it.

I don't get it
either.

I don't...
I don't understand.

Eric.

Don't deal
with this, then.

Fucker.

Rita's rolling right after
breakfast, guys.

Oh, boy.

Oh, I fucked up.

I fucked up.

You really thought Aerosmith
wrote "Train Kept A-Rollin"'?

I already told you.

Eric was the blues guy
and music freak.

The one with
all the knowledge.

But something happened on
the stage that night.

Magic.

Like we were supposed to

find that joint
and have that experience.

After that, things just...

fell into place.

# Blackout
in the basement #

# There's noise in
the garage #

# Been drowned in
sound and vision #

# Was it only a mirage? #

# And keep my head
out of the sand #

# I see you as you are #

# Me I'm here
on solid ground #

# And you in darkness #

# Floating like a star #

# You drifted too far #

# Without you #

# I slip and fall #

# But I won't crawl #

# Break down the wall #

# With or without you #

# One more drink #

# It's not what
you think #

# I'm gone in a blink #

# With or without you #

# Slip and fall #

# And I won't crawl #

Fuck you!
Fuck!

# I'll ride around this
fucking world #

# I'll drive
a million miles #

# But home is always
in my head #

# A lost forgotten child #

# Another place
another pretty face #

# Whatever I can find #

# Some temporary ecstasy #

# To help me
lose my mind #

# When your star
don't shine #

# Without you #

# I slip and fall #

# But I won't crawl #

# Break down the wall #

# With or without you #

# One more drink #

# It's not what
you think #

# I'm gone in a blink #

# With or without you #

# Get what you give #

# It's my time to live #

# Yeah man #

# It's my time #

# Without you #

# Listen #

# Without you #

# I'm going #

# I'm going #

# I'm going #

# I'm gonna run #

# Without you #

# I slip and I fall #

# But I won't crawl #

# Break down the wall #

# With or without you #

# One more drink #

# It's not what
you think #

# I'm gone in a blink #

# Now I'm without you #

# Slip and fall #

# But I won't crawl #

# I got it all #

# With or without you #

# You get what
you give #

# It's my time to live ##

I did New York to
LA in 51 hours.

That's insane.

Steinbeck said that nature
put a desert

in front of
California to test a man.

Test what?

His will.

To see if he was good enough
to get to California.

Why are we stopping?

Because I need to rest.

So you really knew
Jimi Hendrix, huh?

Yeah.

Cafe Wha? Days.

Oh, thanks, man.

Do you know we're missing
a huge part

of the human story?

No, I didn't know, no.

Like we're living in
a massive case of amnesia.

What?

No, l...
are we free?

I don't know.

Do we know
who we are?

Y'know, where we
came from?

Spyder, what are you
talking about?

No, are we free?

Or are we just in a...

prison, a fucking prison,
you know?

With no bars
and no walls.

Nothing.

Just this...

distraction.

This distraction
from distraction

from the fucking
distraction.

That's what I think.

What... what did Maggie
put in this shit?

I'm going to bed.

You all right?

Yeah.

Get some sleep.

Sweet dreams.

Good night, Spyder.

That's good.

Let's get out of here.
It's a full moon.

Toodle-oo.

Toodle-oo.

Okay, so play me a song.

Okay.

Yeah, I got
a song for you.

# It's a lonely planet
joy when #

# You bring the songs
from the other boys #

# That's right #

# I'm a lonely planet boy #

# And I'm trying #

# Baby for your love #

# Whoa, whoa, whoa
yeah #

# You pick me up #

# You're out
driving in your car #

# When I tell you
where I'm going #

# You're always telling me
it's too far #

# But how could
you be driving #

# Down by my home #

# When you know
that I ain't got one #

# And I'm #

# I'm so all alone ##

Yay, I love that song.

So we made
the mythic journey.

Eric got what he wanted.

And you?

Did you get
what you wanted?

# Sweet rock candy #

# Sweet rock candy ##

And that's all she wrote.

Beautiful, guys,
really great.

Thank you so much, man.

It's been...
I can't believe it.

A pleasure, baby,
pleasure.

Eric... Eric.
Yeah?

Come here for a second,
I gotta show you something.

Come on.

This is for you.

Are you kidding me?
Nope.

Do you like it?

Like it?

It's fucking beautiful.

Where did
you get this?

I got some guy,
you know.

You got some guy?
Hop in.

Go on, open it up,
it's right there.

Oh, my God.

This is mine?

Yep.

Oh, my God.

All right, you get
out of here, okay?

PCH awaits.
Oh, my God.

I mean, you're gonna be at
my party tonight, right?

My place?
Yeah.

I mean, I'll check my, uh...

Fucking dickhead.

Here.

Uh...

Thanks, Eric.

Thank you.

Get the fuck
out of here, asshole.

All right.

Go on.

Oh, God.

That sounds nice.

# Baby when
I watch you walk #

# Make me wanna weep #

# Oh babe
the way you talk #

# It keeps me from my sleep #

# I want your
sweet rock candy #

# I can't barely stand it #

# Come on over
come see what I got #

# Come on over baby
I'm running hot #

# Please, please honey #

# Be my baby #

# Be my baby #

# Sweet, sweet honey #

# Be my baby #

# Be my baby ##

Nice view.

No!

Los Angeles!

So la-ta!

Oh, hey.

So good.

Excuse you, party boy.

Of course, it's good.

It's the pink stuff.

Pure uncut.

Nothing says you're back
on top like pink cocaine.

Oh, we're back on top.

Why?

Because of me.

Rosie is on it.

That's right,
hits for days,

hits for days.

My baby's wrote a hit.

A hit.

So proud.

So proud.

I told you, didn't I?
What?

That I'd take care of you.

I take care of you.

I took care of you.

Guys.

I'll take care of you
right now.

What?
Fuck it.

I said, fuck it.

Not this again.
Oh, yes.

It's been so long,
baby.

Here, give me some.

Oh.

Bad, you're bad, you're bad,
you're bad.

What so-la top?

Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah!

Yeah, good time.

Oh, man.

This is unbelievable.

Have you guys
seen Spyder?

Yeah, he's in the back
over there.

That way?
Yeah.

Ow!

Okay, okay,
I got it!

Look...

Look.

Oh, fuck.
Oh, God.

Eric.

Eric, it...

Eric!

Eric.

Oh, fuck.
Oh...

Tell him.

Oh, fuck, Eric!

Yeah!

Eric!

He made me.

Eric!
What's up?

Wait, wait, wait, Eric!

What the fuck's going on?

Well?

Now what the fuck
did you do?

Answer me, asshole!

What the fuck
did you do now?

Get in the house.

Go in the fucking
house!

Fuck!

Fucked up,
fucked up!

You really like him.

And here we are.

Here we are.

If you listen
very carefully...

pay attention to
the notes...

the sound...

they way he...

the fingers sliding up
and down the strings...

it's like there's a...

eulogy buried in
every blues song.

Did you really think
that you could just

run away from all this?

I invited you here,
didn't I?

In my home.

Didn't I?

And why did you
call me here?

When no one's seen or heard
from you in, what, 20 years?

Is there a third album?

Who was Eric Genson?

He was like my brother.

And then
he was gone.

Just like that.

And I...

And I read,
and I read...

No answers.

None.

All the great ones
died at 27.

Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin,

Brian Jones, Kurt Cobain,

Jim Morrison, Robert Johnson.

Most men live lives of
quiet desperation

and go to the grave
with the song still in them.

You take those.

Please.

Okay.

Cliff...

Thank you.
