Jose, let's go!

Jose, get up!
You're going to be late!

Miguel, hurry up!
Don't you ever leave the bathroom?

"Miguel, hurry up.

Don't you ever leave the bathroom?"

You need to go the the restroom?
Yeah.

Aww. Aww.

Miguel, that's not even funny!

Really?
You locked the door?

A long river. A long river!

It smells good.
Oh, no, no.

Over there. Over there.

Why don't you get up
when I ask you to get up?

That way you wouldn't be
running late all the time.

Here you go.

How come Miguel gets more?

Your brother needs
all the protein he can get

for his big game tonight.

He probably won't eat
anything anyway.

He's to busy plucking
his eyebrows like a girl.

Yeah?
Oh, man, come on.

Stop playing.
Stop. Come on.

I'm late. Please.
Did you wash your hands?

Spotless.

Come on, mom.

Oye, mijo. Here.

You're still hungry?
Eat this.

Really, mom?
Expired cereal?

Jose, what is your problem?

I told you I'm going to be late!

You keep shouting all the time.
No, sit down.

Sit down and eat!
Sit down and eat, okay?

I don't want you to be late.
Okay. Okay.

It's a big day, you know?

You've been waiting
for this a long time.

Hopefully, after tonight's game
you'll get scholarships.

Oh, please, god.
Please, god.

You okay?
You're not feeling sick, are you?

No. Mom, can you stop?

Okay.

You know, I have a chess game
today against Dani.

And if I win, Dani buys me
lunch and dessert.

That's nice, mijo. Eat.
You're okay?

You're feeling okay today?
Yeah, I'm fine, mom.

Buenos Dias, Jose.
Did you eat?

Welcome to Abuelita's
specialty restaurant.

This is real sausage.
I'll make it for you.

That's okay.
Eh?

What do you want to drink?
How about a soda?

Ay, you're loco.

Let's see.

How about some coffee?

Abuelita, I don't drink coffee.
I'm too young.

Too young? I've been drinking coffee
since I was six years old.

Keeps you warm when
you're working out in the fields.

No, thanks.

you know, I have a chess game
today against Dani.

Do you remember
the last techniques I taught you?

I practiced all night.
Go easy on that poor kid, huh?

You're it.
Stop.

What's wrong?

Did you get in a fight
with your mom again?

With Miguel?
Cut it out.

You're such a butthead.
You're a double butthead.

A double butthead? Really?
Yeah.

All right, stand over here.

Put your hands
on the hood, please.

You don't have
any weapons on you?

Get in the car.

Let's go check it out.

No.
What?

Let's go through
the cemetery instead.

But we're going to be late.
It's a shortcut.

You scared?
No way, weirdo.

Last one there gets first start
for the chess match.

Three...
Two...

Cheater!

<i>If there was a song
of the story of us</i>

<i>it wouldn't have a refrain</i>

<i>it'd be a hundred verses</i>

<i>and never the same</i>

<i>like coming back round again</i>

<i>I'd play it</i>

<i>and you would understand it</i>

<i>and give it just the right name</i>

<i>la de da, la de da</i>

<i>oh, la de da da</i>

<i>la de da, la de da</i>

da da
come on.

Come on!
You throw like a girl!

Do something!
Throw it home! Throw it...

He got you right on the...

Quit throwing like a pansy!

You got to man up!
Oh, yeah, baby!

You better watch out.
She's got an arm!

Whoa!
Ow!

That's the bell!

That's it, that's it. That's the bell.

Goodness.

I'm sorry, man.

What's your deal, man?

Hey! Hey!
Hey.

Enough!
What are you doing?

That's enough. That's enough!

What the hell are you idiots...

I mean...

You guys really disappoint me.

He started it.
You, young lady,

need to mind your own business.

And stop acting like catwoman,
jumping all over everybody.

Go inside. Go inside.
I'll deal with you later.

Go. Go!

You, too. Not you.

Jose, what's the matter with you?

You should try and be
more like your brother.

Why? Because I don't play
as good as him?

He's striving for the championship.

You could learn
a thing or two from him.

Whatever.

How did you do that?
Can't tell you.

Really?
Mm-hmm. Check.

Well, then...
You know what's funny?

I knew you were going to do that.
Huh. Check.

I knew you were going to do that.

Are you sure, Dani?
I hate doing this.

No fair. No!

Oh, yeah, it was.
Nice job, Jose.

I saw how you skewered her king.

You dominated the board.

That's because he pressured me.
This game doesn't count.

No, no, no.
I want my pepperoni pizza.

No.
You know,

you have killer instincts.

Thanks.
And we had a deal.

No.
See? Look, you got to move here.

You know,
you're just like your brother.

Are you ready to cheer him on
in tonight's game?

Why does everybody
keep asking me about Miguel?

Is today national Miguel day?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Jose!

What are you thinking?

You just bought yourself a trip
to the principal's office.

Come on, let's go!

You know...

There's a word that describes

what you did out there,

and it's on the tip of my tongue.

I can't remember...
Oh, yeah.

Stupid.

"Stupid" is a word I thought
I'd never hang on you, Jose.

And there's nothing you can say

to convince me
that you're innocent.

And I've heard
all the excuses, trust me.

"They made me do it."

"My girlfriend
wanted me to do it."

I did it.

I wanted to do it.

I would do it again.

Well, since you're being
so abnormally honest,

what punishment
would you impose on thyself?

If my brother did it,
you wouldn't punish him.

Is that what you surmise?

Everyone let's the champion slide.

That's all you care about,
and you know it!

Feeling a little destructive today,
aren't we?

If you spent more time
acting like a champion

and less time envying them,
you wouldn't be here,

or in after school detention,

which is where you're going
for the next two weeks.

Come on.
You want me to make it three?

Where you going?
Sit your butt right back down.

You don't leave
until I tell you to go.

What do you...
What do you have there?

Cherry jawbreaker.

My mom brought it from Mexico.

Cherry jawbreaker, huh?
Mm-hmm.

Here. Why don't you have it?

All right.

Let's just consider this payment

in lieu of the damages that
I'm not charging you for, okay?

You just try and keep
your hands to yourself.

And just remember
one thing, Jose.

The privilege of a lifetime
is being who you are.

Put that there in the bank.
Run with it.

Go on.

No, I like the chicharones.
Hey, Jose. You got a second?

Poor kid.

He doesn't have half the talent
that Miguel does.

Jose, you need to sit down
and do your homework.

How are you?

I'm bringing back the chess club

and I want you to be in it.

I don't know how many students
I'm going to be able to recruit

or if we're even
going to get anywhere.

If you join the team,
I'll get you out of this detention.

Nobody plays chess around here.

I'll teach them.

Teach who?

Them.

Good luck with that.

Think about it.

Check.

Hey, why you getting
home so late?

They gave me detention.
Why?

Because I broke Miguel's trophy.
Why would you do that?

I felt like it.

You felt like it?
You felt... get in the house.

I'm going to teach you
about feeling something.

Get in the house right now, Jose.

Get in the...
Are you kidding me?

Jose! You better get...

If I hurt myself, you are
going to get in so much...

I swear, if I...
You're going to be grounded,

I swear to god.

I can't believe you!

Jos... oh, god,
where'd he go?

Boy, where are you?

Jose!

What happened to you?
Shh.

My god, what a foul smell.
Shh! Abuela!

Let us get you
out of those clothes

before people think
there's a skunk in my house!

Shut the door. Hurry.

What did you do? What's going on?

I'm not here.
Please, go cover for me.

Please. Please.

Have you seen Jose?

I can't find him.
He's in big trouble.

Is he here?
No.

Maybe he went to Dani's house.

That little brat got detention.
Can you believe that?

If he comes here,
send him home, okay?

Oh, I will, Mija, Si.

Now, Mija...
Mom, please, please.

Just send him home, okay?
Okay.

oye, I am going to teach you

one of your grandpa's
favorite strategies.

I don't feel like it, Abuelita.
Come on, Jose.

You know that when you play,
it makes you feel better.

This one is special.

It's called
"home away from home."

If I bring out
my pawn king to e4.

You bring out
your pawn king to e5.

There you go.

I bring out my knight to f3.

You bring out your knight to c6.

Mmm.

I bring out my bishop to c4.

Ahh.

Okay, everybody, come in!

Okay, okay, okay.

All right, I want everybody's
attention, please.

First of all, welcome.

And for all y'all
who don't know me,

I am the mother of the best
soccer player on this planet.

The universe!

All I have to say is
David Beckham better watch out

because my baby's coming.
Ain't that right, sweetie?

He is going to get a big scholarship
to a big college

and he's going to kick
some soccer Booty. Yeah!

That's right.

Let's get them a drink.
Come on, who wants something?

Not you guys.
Yeah, right here. Right here.

We got some soda
back there for you somewhere.

Mom, I'm going to head out
with the guys for a bit.

Okay?
Oh, you are?

We're starving. We haven't
had anything to eat all day.

We're just going to pick up
some burgers and be right back.

Come right back, because
you have to ice this shoulder.

Mom, it's fine.
Can I go with you?

I want a burger.
Um... just stay here.

Stay here for a bit, okay?
I'll bring you something, all right?

Number five?
No tomatoes, toasted buns.

I got you. All right.
I'll see you in a bit.

Jose, will you throw out
the garbage, please?

To the champions, boys!

Oh, ho, ho, ho!
Oh, snap!

And here, fellas, is to finally
getting out of this dump.

Yes, sir.
Here we go, boys. Whoo!

It's cold.

Party, guys!

Oh, no, you did not!
Oh, no.

Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.

You holding back from us, bro?

Yikes.
Give me that.

Don't do it.
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

What are you doing,
designated driver?

Why am I always
the designated driver?

Because you wanted to drive
your blue power ranger car.

We won!
We won the game!

We won!
My ass is buzzing, bro.

That's disgusting.
Where is it?

Don't ever say that again.
Ole, ole, ole!

Hey, I got a text.
Oh, this girl, bro! Damn.

We won the game!
Damn, she fine.

Look at this girl.
That's your mom's name.

Pretty hot.
Watch this.

Whoa!

May the blessing of almighty god,
the father, the son

and the holy spirit,
come down on you.

Amen.
Amen.

I ruined his trophy at school.

Sometimes brothers do that.

Why did this happen?

I don't know, mijo.

I'm trying to understand myself.

Come on.
Let's go home.

Andale.

Hey.

I didn't know
you were back already.

Why didn't you wait
for me this morning?

I didn't feel like it.

Do you want to hang
after school?

I brought my game boy.
Barn!

Nah.

Guitar hero?
I'll let you win.

I have detention.

Yay! So do I.
Come on.

It's called the nimzo-Indian.

Welcome, Jose.

Okay, you guys
already know the routine.

Here. Let's do it.
Take out your pieces.

Jose, I'm the new detention teacher.

And it's now officially
chess team practice.

If any of you
want regular detention,

you can walk down the hallway
and complain to your principal.

I'm sure he'll be happy
to make it more painful for you.

I learned new tactics, Jose.

Consider yourself warned.
Why are you doing this?

To learn how
to beat you at chess.

And to win back
that pizza and shake.

Here.

What? You're scared?

I dare you.

You want to double-dare?

Don't hold your breath.

Okay, today we're going to try
a few techniques

that will weaken
your opponent in an instant

and ensure the best possible chance
for a checkmate.

Hi, mom.

Here's some water.

It's important to stay hydrated.

Do you want anything?

I can go get you something.

Anything?

Sorry.

Abuela?
Yeah?

How do you know that Miguel
went to heaven?

I know because
he was a good son and brother.

What about when you do
bad things?

Mijo, god watches
our every move,

so it's better to do more good
than bad things in your life.

And Miguel?
Yes, he did.

You want to know what I think?

What?

I think your grandfather
is teaching Miguel

how to play chess
just as he taught me.

Really?
Like, right now, maybe?

Oh, yeah.

He loved to teach as much
as he loved to play.

Cool.

This belonged to your Abuelito.

It's a family heirloom.

She will protect you
as she has me.

Wow. Thank you, Abuelita.

Mm-hmm.

And remember what your grandfather
always said about the queen.

Don't use her or I'll lose her.

My move?
Yes, your move.

This is what
you call notation books.

Here's when you write down

all your information
on how you make a move.

Take the pencils,
and you can pass them down.

Please don't eat the pencils.
We're going to need them.

Okay, when you're playing chess,
you got to focus on the center.

You got to focus
right in the middle,

because the center
is where you want to be.

Now, the rule of thumb is this,

the weakest pawn is the pawn
closest the the king,

and the art of chess
is about attacking.

But when you're attacking,
you've got to ask yourself,

is that movement some
kind of form of defense?

Or is that movement some
kind of form of attack?

Ask not what your king
can do for you,

but what you can do
for your king.

Shake your pants, everyone.

You ready, army?
Begin.

Pawn a4!
Good move, Jose.

Attack, and always be attacking.

Pawn to e5.

That's a really good move.
Think, Jose.

Knight to f3.
Come on, bring it.

Right smack in the middle.
This is a new frontier.

And in the frontier
where the battle goes down,

right, it's threat
meeting another threat.

You're going to fight the threat
with another threat.

Knight to c6.

Acknowledge the fact that
she's not fighting aggressively.

She's thinking about it.
Bishop, c4.

Absolutely right.
Good move, Jose.

Feel what they're doing.
Oh, yeah.

Knight to f6.

Knight, g5.
Excellent, Jose.

Now you're using excellent tactics

and you're dominating the board.

Now what are you going to do?

Rook to g8.

I never taught you that move.

Bishop, take f7.

Check!
King, e7!

Yeah, Peter!

Capture rook.

I think we're becoming
a real team here.

Regionals are coming up,

and we might just make it.

Okay, let's play one more game,
okay, guys?

What are you doing
bringing the queen out?

Mr. Alvarado wants us
to use the queen.

What?

No, the queen is one
of the most powerful pieces.

She should not be used.

If you expose yourself,
you're done.

That's how your grandfather
taught me to play,

bless his soul, and that's how
I taught you to play.

I know, but he's the coach.

Then he should teach you right.

He's a retard!
Abuelita!

Ay! Okay, I'll calm down before
Abuelita gets ghetto on you.

Listen, I have some leftovers
for your mom.

Can you take them when you're done?

Hey, mom.
I brought you some food.

It's on the kitchen table.
Okay?

I can heat it up
for you if you want.

Mom, can you say something?

Why did god take your brother?

I know.

Maybe it should've been me.

Hey, principal Thomas.

Any chance you can make it rain
chess team money?

We have a chess team?
Yeah. It's pretty damn awesome.

We've been practicing for months,

and now we're competing
in the district.

Yeah, well, the district
has cut all money

for extracurricular activities,
so I can give you what's leftover,

but I can promise you
it ain't much.

The scraps?
Come on, that's like $5.00.

How am I supposed to get my team
to Dallas this year?

Welcome to Brownsville, Mr. A.

You seen the soccer field?

Coach Stevens' been crying
for over a year to get it re-sod.

Now, my job is to fill that case.

You help me do my job,
then and only then I can help you.

In the meantime, here.

A little donation to the cause.

You can't win if you don't play.

Distractions?

What does "distractions" mean?

It's like when we have homework,

but there's a great movie playing
on TV so we forget to do it.

And the teacher yells at us
the next day.

Yeah!

It can also happen when
we're not focused on our matches

and end up losing.
Yeah, there was this kid,

he was picking his nose
through the whole entire match.

That's a very disgusting example.
But he does make a point.

Feast your eyes on this.

The checkmates.

Did you see what
their nickname is?

Butt cheek one, butt cheek two,

because they live in
a crackhouse.

Stop!

Do you understand?

The checkmates
are the team to beat.

We need to put
Brownsville on the map

and show them that we exist.

Let's nail this
district match coming up.

You down, dawg?

Yeah!
We're down!

Oh, yeah!
Down, fool?

Down with the clown?
Yeah! Every day!

You want to be on top, right?
Yeah!

You are going to go in there
and knock on the door and say,

"wake up!"
Yeah!

"Brownsville is here!"
Wake up!

Annihilate any crazy distractions
you have in your head

get the boards.

No!

That teacher is crippling
your game.

Abuelita, why are you hating on
Mr. Alvarado?

I'm not hating Mr. Alvarado.

I just don't like his style.
I'm learning different now.

Mijo, if you have the best goalie
on your soccer team,

do you move him
to play center or wing?

No! You try to get him
to be a better goalie.

Look at my knight.

Hey, mom. Ls there
anything in your fridge?

Some cold cuts
and fresh bread, Mija.

Hi, Jose.
Hey.

Why didn't they make
the king more powerful?

The queen can move anywhere.
He's the king.

Yeah, well,
you can't change the rules.

Ma, where's the bread?
So, maybe I'll just go here.

Who's winning?

Look at your queen
and look at mine.

Who's winning?

Never sacrifice your queen
for a killing.

You guys want anything?

Mijo, tomorrow,
just remember what I taught you.

I've been busting my butt
teaching you since you were five.

So don't screw up and make me
throw my flip-flop at your head.

So much pressure.
Pressure is good.

Checkmate.

Your turn.
I know.

You're new, aren't you?

Yeah.
This is my first tournament.

I'll take it easy on you, then.

That's okay.
I insist.

It could possibly traumatize you
if you lose to me.

What do you mean?
Well, I'm a girl,

and some boys can't handle
losing to a girl.

Sometimes they never recover.
Some stop playing forever.

In fact, the last guy that lost
looked just like you,

but you're cuter.
That's not going to happen to me.

Shh.
Sorry.

Don't be sorry.

Be gone.

Check.

That's not fair.
Haven't you heard?

Life isn't fair.

Hmm.

Checkmate.

What happened?
I got distracted.

Go pull yourself together

and go support
your fellow teammates.

And keep your mouth shut.

I used my vacation money
for this. Go.

I need mucho cerveza.

Good match.
No, it wasn't.

You slaughtered me.

Yeah, I did slaughter you,
but don't worry about it.

It was your first...
All right.

Was your coach mad?
I think so.

He asked for a lot of beer.
Yeah, sometimes they do that.

It takes the edge off.
The edge of what?

I don't know.
They don't make sense half the time.

Oh, true.
I heard you lost, champ.

To me. I'm Sandy.
Hi, Sandy.

Nice going, Jose.
You know how to pick a winner.

He played a solid game.
Be proud of him.

Oh, I'm very proud
of my teammate.

Ow.
That's a secret code we use.

Oh! Are you best friends?

Yeah.

Jose, you were so cool,
not like the other guys.

There was this one time
I played a guy...

More like a kid
who thought he was a guy,

Hey, you.

I saw your game earlier.
Not bad.

Thanks.

Looks like you got
your hands full, buddy.

Let's go, Jose.
Why?

Mr. Alvarado is looking for us.
No, he isn't.

I have to practice
before my next match.

Us winners do that.
Come on, teammate.

Good luck!
You, too, for next time.

What? You look at that!

Look at your shirt!
Look at your shirt, man!

Attention, everyone!

Brownsville brainiacs,
we're headed for the regionals!

I'll race you.
Cheater!

Mr. Alvarado,
why do we always have pizza?

Why are you always
complaining, Peter?

He's like a woman!

You want to take it outside
with a woman?

Let's go! Okay, come on.
Okay!

Yo, Muhammad Ali!

You want to restrain
that left hook just for the night?

You don't want to knock a brother down
before the big fight!

Ooh!
J.C. You're not.

You're old like dried snot.
And your school photo

looks like a mugshot.

Oh!

What!
Sorry, Mr. Alvarado.

Your bags are in the front.
Grab them.

Can you believe
we got first place?

Yeah. You're still in shock, huh?

These are awesome.
We're the bomb.

Hey.

If Miguel were here,
he'd be proud of you.

What?
That I'm a good loser?

She played a good game.

I probably would have
lost to her, too.

Yeah, right.
When hell freezes over.

Can I ask you a question?

Yeah. What?

Why did you want to
avoid the border patrol officers

when they were arresting those guys
on our way to school?

I wasn't avoiding them.
Yeah, you were.

You were scared.
I wasn't scared.

Don't you trust me?
Yes.

Prove it.

My parents just told me
they're not us citizens.

I thought you said
your mom was from Brownsville.

She told me that
so I wouldn't worry.

Swear on your life
you won't tell anyone.

Promise me.

I promise.

I won't tell anyone.

<i>All the trouble I've seen</i>

<i>disappears</i>

<i>into the night</i>

<i>and I know the tighter
I hold on to you</i>

mine's better. See? Look.

The noise makes it all...

The sound of it.
Yeah.

Oh!

Ow.

I'm going to remember that.

I'll get you next time
in Dodgeball.

I'll get you.

You wouldn't.
I would. I would, too.

Hey, Abuelita.
Hey! How did it go?

It went okay.

And? What else?

That's it.
Hmm.

I lost.

I told you, that teacher...
Abuela, it had nothing to do with him.

It was my fault.
I lost my concentration.

What do you mean?
Well, I didn't use my head.

There was girl,
and she was really cute, too.

Blonde hair and really cute.
Listen to me.

It wasn't that
you didn't use your head.

It's that you used the wrong one!
Abuela!

This is the biggest problem
with a man.

You always lose
when he's in control.

Abuela, can you stop it?
You're traumatizing me.

I'm trying to save you.
From what?

From yourself.

Listen to me...
Abuela, I know. You told...

Dirty little bastard, listen...
Abuela, Abuela! Listen.

I'm tired and I want to go
get some rest.

Please do not disturb me.

Well, excuse me,
Mr. blah-blah-blah.

The king doesn't want to talk.
Typical!

Oh, lord, forgive Jose

for he knows not what he does.

It's too dark in here.

Ma, leave it off.

I am too old and blind
to be walking in the dark.

What if I fall and break a hip?

Who'll take care of me then, huh?

I brought you some food.

Jose had a chess game today

and I don't think he did very good.

Maybe you can talk to him
and cheer him up

since I already tried.

You know,
sometimes I wonder who died,

you or Miguel.

He was my son.

Honey, what are you
talking about?

I'm saying that he was my son.
He's not yours.

I know, and he loved you
very much, Mija.

He would light up every time
you would walk into a room.

You know that he thanked me
before every game.

He always thanked me.

And may god bless
Miguelito for eternity.

But, Mija,
what about your other son?

You were blessed to have two.
He doesn't need me.

You took him away from me
a long time ago

and you turned him against me.
I did no such thing.

You were always with Miguel
so I took care of Jose

and I just taught him
how to play chess.

Ma, who asked you
to teach him to play chess?

Who asked you?
But he needed attention!

Attention?
Yes!

Mom, what the hell
do you know about attention?

What do you know?

Every time you and papa
went off to your chess tournaments

and you left me alone,
I needed attention, too.

What do you know about that?
What are you saying?

I hate chess!
I didn't ask you to teach him chess!

I can't deal with this!
I can't deal with this!

I want you to get out of here. Go!

Checkmate.

No, your time ran out.
No.

I checkmated you,
you can't move anywhere.

Anywhere in the square.
Still, you ran out of time...

No. I won. I checkmated you.
Dude, look at your time.

No! You're cheating!

You're a liar!
Hey!

What is this?

Put your hands on the seat.

All of you,
put your hands on your seat.

What happened to my soldiers?

What happened to my knights?
What happened to my kings?

You're acting like a bunch
of salvajes.

You want to bring the violence?
Put it in the board.

Because there are no lies
on the board.

And just like in life,
every action has a consequence.

Pick them up.

I want everyone
to set up the board.

Shake their hands.

This is a battle of the will.

Begin.

<i>- At the park or at the beach...
Check.</i>

<i>At home or on TV,
nothing could go wrong</i>

<i>when you're with me...
Check.</i>

<i>Catch a ride or catch a wave</i>

<i>at home or in la</i>

<i>nothing could go wrong
when you're with me...</i>

Checkmate.

<i>When you're with me</i>

<i>baby, baby, close your eyes</i>

<i>baby, baby, don't think twice</i>

<i>I want you, I want you</i>

<i>baby, baby, don't think twice</i>

<i>I want you, I want you</i>

<i>I want you, want you,
want you, want you...</i>

Guess who.

Not you.
You sound worried.

I'm not.
Well, neither am I.

Good.

I hope you've improved
since last time.

Whatever, homey.
Fo' shizzle my nizzle, dawg.

Let's get rolling, 'aight?

My coach thinks
I have lots of potential.

He thinks I'll be
in top ten next year.

I'll have to travel
to New York for nationals.

Times Square,
strawberry fields... forever.

Can you stop?
All right, guys,

we're ready to begin round three
of our regional tournament

remember,
we are using USCF rules.

If you touch a piece,
you must move it.

Shake hands and begin.

Check.

Checkmate.

Good game.

What happened?

I won.

Did you take notation?

Mm-hmm.
Eso.

Check.

Checkmate.

What? Yes?

<i>'</i> Yes!
<i>'</i> Yes!

Notation? Yes.
Whoa, look at that... oh!

Oh!

Guys, do you think
they're going to fly us to Dallas

for the championship?
If they do,

you're going to have to
take a shower.

I don't stink.
Yes, you do.

Well, here, use this.
It works.

Oh, dude!
You smell like a girl.

Here. It works better
if you take it out of the box.

It's true.

I got a shower cap on my head

hey!
Yep?

Take the cap off and sit down.

Shut up and sit down.

You think that was funny?
It wasn't me.

You find it very humorous?
Ls that funny, Jose? Was it you?

Dani? Dani, isn't that where
your parents work?

Stop the bus.
Dani, sit down.

Stop the bus. Stop!
We can't stop the bus.

Sit down! Dani!
Stop! Get out of the way!

Stop!
We can't stop the bus!

What are you doing?
Jose, what are you doing?

Jose!
Stop the bus!

Stop the frigging bus!
Dani!

Open the door.

I need to get to my mom.

No! Mom!
Dani!

Dani! Jose!

Hey, Jose! Dani!

Jose! No, no, no, no.
Dani!

Get out of here!
Dani!

No, no, no.
No, no. No, no.

We need you over here.
Mom!

No!
My mom!

What are you doing,
Mr. Alvarado?

No, no, no, no, no.

No, don't! Mr. Alvarado!
There's nothing we can do.

Dani!
In the Van. Get in the Van.

Don't go!
Jose.

Dani!
Get them in the Van now.

Okay? Nothing you can do.

Stay with me, all right?

Do you want to go inside?
Your mom's probably worried.

I don't care.

No!

<i>You lifted my chin</i>

<i>brushed the hair from my face</i>

I've never been good

<i>at learning my place</i>

<i>but all my thoughts escape</i>

<i>when you whisper my name</i>

<i>when you whisper my name</i>

<i>when you bring me in</i>

<i>when you hold me close</i>

<i>all the trouble I've seen</i>

<i>disappears into the night</i>

<i>and I know the tighter
I hold onto you</i>

<i>the more everything
will become right</i>

<i>when you whisper my name</i>

<i>stars seem to shine brighter</i>

<i>when you're near</i>

<i>and you see when I'm sad</i>

<i>before I shed a tear...</i>

Okay, we have to get started.

Where's Jose?

He's coming.
Set up your pieces.

But we need him.

Is she going to be okay,
Mr. Alvarado?

Dani's tough,
and she's with her family.

Hopefully, she'll be back.

But listen, we didn't get
to this stage with one player.

Come on, Brownsville brainiacs.

Show me some of that attitude
you often torture me with, huh?

I think it's time
for another speed drill.

Start!

We may have suffered a setback,

but you kids have
what it takes to win.

Hey, listen!

Would I be investing
my rent money in you

if I didn't think
you could do it?

So, come on,
don't make me homeless.

Crap.

Hmm.

You know,
locked away behind glass,

it has an air of exclusivity.

But it's not. It's inclusive.

Everyone benefits.

Wow. A chess title.
South Texas.

Man, that's...
That's unprecedented territory.

District's going to benefit from it.

The community is hungry
for good news about these kids,

and I really think that this
would be the perfect place

to put the story...

Right in the pantheon,
right here.

What do you think?

What do I think?

Well, as you know, we lost Dani.

Yeah.

I just found out Peter
has no running water in his home,

and Jose's headed down
a real bad alley.

Did I mention that
I'm just about flat broke?

I'm selling pickles to pay for gas.

Well, you know what they say.

The harder the battle,
the sweeter the victory.

I'm not investing
my time and heart

into these kids for a trophy.

I'm doing it because chess...

Might just be their chance
for a better life.

That's what I want them
to champion.

I'd like to believe once upon a time
you felt the same way.

I'm sure it wasn't
because of the money.

Am I right?

Well...

Listen, kid.

Where you been, Flojo?

I have a new setup to teach you.

This one is with the queen
in defensive mode.

No, thanks, Abuelita.
What's going on?

How about if we practice

the home away
from home technique?

It's one of your favorites.

Dani's parents got arrested.
What?

Oh, my god.
That's terrible.

What's going on?

Hello?

Dani's parents got arrested.

I heard they were arresting people
at the factory. How's she doing?

She's gone.
Oh.

Well, I'm sure
you'll make other friends.

Dani was my best friend.
I know, mijo,

but what are you going to do?

She should be with her mother.
You think kids are better off

just because they're
with their mothers, like me?

Like Miguel?

Why are you talking to me like this?

You killed him!
What did you say?

You put pressure on Miguel
to be perfect.

He told me.
It's your fault!

You drive all the men
in your life away!

Just like dad,
until he left us, too.

Shut up.
Why?

Can't handle the truth?
Jose!

Miguel was your only life.
And you are hers, too.

Mom! I can speak for myself.

Then tell him.

Oh, my god.

Hi, Jose.

What are you doing here, coach?

You are Jose's coach?

Yeah.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

Well, can't you see
that we're fighting here?

Yeah, the entire neighborhood

can hear that you guys
are fighting here.

What do you want with my kid?

I just came to check up on him.

Why don't you check on
the shitty attitude you helped create?

Is that what they're teaching him
at this school?

Between and my mother,
you ruined him.

Excuse me, Mrs. Perez.

Jose's a very decent

and very talented young man.

Don't you see?

Miguel died.

You lost a son,

but Jose has lost his brother
and his mother.

If you'll allow me.

Jose, can I please
talk to you outside?

I'm going to be straight with you.

We have the state tournament
coming up.

On a personal level,

I feel horrible about what you kids
have to deal with.

But we're a team,
and we worked so hard.

I can't do this without you.

Every king needs his knight.

What would Dani do?

What would Miguel do?

You dropped this on the bus.

Mijo, no matter what you decide...

please, follow your heart.

<i>It's not impossible
for me to cry</i>

it's just...
Okay.

Bishop to e3.

<i>But it's ingrained, you know</i>

<i>boys don't cry</i>

come on, Peter.
It's your move.

Peter, come on, make a move.

I don't want to do this anymore.

I don't want to wear
my crown and this robe

in the middle of the street
on my day off, but I am.

Come on, be strategic.
Find the center.

<i>It's not impossible</i>
<i>just move</i> a <i>piece.</i>

<i>For me to cry, it's just...</i>

Susie!

<i>And it's a shame, you know</i>

<i>but it's ingrained, you know...
</i> Time <i>out.</i>

<i>- Boys will kick and scream...</i>

Cause a scene

<i>take your anger out
on someone else</i>

<i>steal their car, race their car</i>

<i>don't you dare</i>

<i>no, don't you dare cry...</i>

Mr. A., what are you doing?

Get back on your square
before you run out of time.

And by the way, I was looking,
and you're toast.

You're the king and you're not even
protecting yourself.

How are you supposed to win
by making weak moves like that?

Tell me.

<i>Boys don't cry, boys don't cry...</i>
<i>Make</i> a <i>move.</i>

Bishop, g7.

<i>No, baby...</i>

Pawn to f3.

<i>Boys don't cry, boys don't cry...</i>

Castle!

Queen, b2.
Find the center!

No, Mr. Alvarado.
Fight for the center.

Knight, c6.
Yes.

Castle.
You want to expose his queen.

Expose their king.

One of the strategies
is called the Ruy Lopez.

You start off with your pawns,
and one's in front of the king.

You move that, and then you start off
moving one of your knights...

Any of your knights, okay?

If they use the Sicilian,
you got to use the Yugoslav attack.

You're going to study the position,

study what kind of game he plays.

Strategize these movements, guys.

That's an illegal touch move.
You always forget to say that.

Let's hear it
for our amazing chess team.

Come on!

Put it together.
There you go.

Right on. Go team!

All right.

We have to remember
that we're here today

to help sponsor their trip to Dallas
to play in this championship.

And I'm very thankful
for the parents

for bringing out
all the concessions.

We got hot dogs
and pizza and tamales

and all kinds of good stuff,

so please gorge yourselves.

Just get fat. It's okay,
because we need the money.

We also have posters of the brilliant
Brownsville brainiacs.

If you buy it, they will sign it.

And I'm also available
for photographs today.

Come on!

Whew! Play on!

Yeah! Yeah!

Yeah!

Hi, Abuelita.
Hi, mijo.

No' no' no' no' no.

<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

you have to eat something
before you go to sleep.

Abuelita, I'm tired.

I know, but you need
energy to think.

Without your brain,

the chessboard
becomes a storm at sea

with waves this high
that will swallow you up

if you don't eat my taquitos!

There you are.

You know, you've been
working really hard.

You remind me of your grandpa.

He would play and play and...

We could watch his beard
grow over his mouth.

<i>I...</i>

the taquitos warm enough, mijo?

Now you really remind me
of your grandpa.

Hey. Good morning.

I'm sorry I didn't make it
to your school.

Jerry asked me to work
an extra shift.

He gave me overtime.

I got you milk for your cereal.

Let me get a bowl, all right?

Not going to tear
that banner down, now, are you?

No.

Oh, darn!

Feels good to be
part of a team, don't it?

Yeah.

Good luck, Jose.
Thank you.

Yeah, brainiacs!

Go, brainiacs, go.

Your mom got called into work
at the last minute,

but she told me to tell you
mucho good luck.

Yeah.

Don't forget your underwear.

I forgot mine on a trip
with your grandpa

and I ended up wearing his,
and they were not so clean.

All right, Abuelita.
I don't need to hear that.

How long is your bus ride?

Ten hours.
Ten hours? Oh, my god.

How can anyone ride a bus
for ten hours?

I have some hemorrhoid cream
just in case.

Abuelita, I'm good down there.

You're good down there.

God bless you!

I'll be praying for you.

Blessed be the lord god almighty,
follow Jose in his journey...

Abuelita, Abuelita.

I think you've blessed me enough
to last me 20 years.

Oh, my love, not enough blessings
are enough for you.

I love you so much.

Are you ready?

I wouldn't be so nervous
if Dani was here.

You'd be goofing off
and I'd be yelling at you two.

Mr. A., do you think I'll ever
see her again?

If you want something bad enough,

it will always be within your reach.

Just like this tournament.

You really want to win this bad,
don't you?

<i>All my life</i>

<i>I want to be a firefly</i>

<i>burning bright through the night...</i>

Shooting for the moon

<i>with you there</i>

<i>flying through the midnight air</i>

<i>all the things that we could do</i>

<i>all the places we could share</i>

<i>where we're going,
we don't need a plan</i>

<i>hold it all in
the palm of our hand</i>

let's be more
than we've ever been

<i>the things we never do...</i>

Jose, take care of the fort.
I'll be right back, okay?

<i>Take a chance and jump right in...</i>

Hey, hi.
Brownsville brainiacs.

<i>Here and now was made
for me and you</i>

let's be more
than we've ever been

<i>the things we never do...</i>

Let's get a couple games in.

Come on.

<i>Here and now was made for me...</i>

<i>- Quick. Quick.
And you...</i>

Don't block the doors, okay?

Okay.

I'm going to find out
what's next.

<i>All the things that we could do</i>

<i>these days were made
for me and you</i>

<i>all the things that we could,
all the things that we could...</i>

<i>- You may begin.
Baby, you and me could do</i>

<i>all the things that we could do</i>

<i>baby, you and me
could do, do, yeah</i>

let's be more
than we've ever <i>been...</i>

Check.
Check.

<i>Right here, right now
was made for me and you</i>

<i>- take a chance, jump right in...
Checkmate.</i>

<i>Do things we never do</i>

<i>here and now
was made for me and you...</i>

Checkmate.

<i>Here and now was made</i>

<i>for me and you.</i>

Next match?
Yeah.

Jose! OMG!

I heard about Dani.
I am so sorry. I feel so bad.

And you, how are you doing?
Are you okay?

Have you been practicing?
Do you want some help?

Do you want some party mix?
They relax me.

Whoa, whoa.
Take it easy.

What are you looking at?

Nothing.
Liar.

You were checking out
that girl walking by.

No, I wasn't.
Are you leading me on?

Because I'm not going to be
the other woman.

I was just drinking water.

Boys!

Girls!
Boys. Girls!

Isn't this place a lot better
than last year's?

I wouldn't know.
This is your first time?

Yeah.

Then this game
won't take very long.

I won last year.

You may begin.

Check.

Check.

Checkmate.

Good game.

Punk.

Jose, study the notations.
Here's his weak point.

Try to get him
when he moves his king.

I'll be right back.
I need to see the team standings.

Keep working, keep working.

I'm not mad anymore.
I saw your last match.

You were great.
I was just lucky.

That was last year's champ.

It's not realistic
to think it was luck.

In fact, you turned
that game on him...

Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, sure.

Why do you talk
so much and so fast?

Hello?
I'm a woman.

That's what we do.

That dude gives me the creeps.

Are you playing him?
Yeah.

You're toast.

Hi, I'm Jose.
What's your name?

You don't know my name?

No.

You really do live
in the middle of nowhere.

Not again.

Hi.

I just want to say good luck.

You're Jacob, right?

Yeah.

You have really cute eyes.

Anything else?

Pretty, isn't she?

She's okay.

Dude, she's hot.

Yeah.

You may begin.

Check.

Checkmate.

What?

Checkmate.

Enjoy it.
It won't last.

So how's the team doing?

I lost count.
The computer broke.

But we're holding up.

Here are your chess notes
and your next opponent.

Start studying, okay?

We need you to make
at least 5 out of 8 points.

The kid doesn't make mistakes.

Thanks for that.

The computer's finally back up.

We're still uploading scores,

but we believe the points
from this match

will determine the team champion.

Do all of you understand?

Yes.
Yeah.

Good.
All right.

Come on, Jose.

I heard you're pretty good.

Your coach told you
to ignore me, didn't he?

My coach thinks
you're going to win.

Can you believe that?
Of course, I do.

You know, my best friend Dani
was supposed to be here.

She would do anything in her power
to take you down.

Well, since she's not here,

I'll do it for her.

Ladies and gentlemen,

yo" may begin.

Don't take that move.

Check.

Checkmate.

Good game.

That's okay.
Your points were good.

We still have a chance.
Thanks.

Ladies and gentlemen,

there was slight delay
with the results

of some of the final scores.

We have our winning teams.

Starting with the middle school
Texas state champion...

Congratulations goes to...

The Brownsville brainiacs.

What? Come on, man.
You got to be kidding me.

There's got to be some mistake.
Stand back.

No, what kind of operation
are you running here?

Stand back.

And the high school
state champion, Dallas east.

Congratulations to everybody.

This has been
a fantastic tournament.

Good job, guys.
Good job.

Jose! Jose!

Abuelita,
what are you doing here?

I thought you couldn't make it.

You're kidding.
No way!

But how'd you make it here?

Well...

<i>I sit there in my cubicle
in the morning</i>

<i>I</i> can hardly wait
to Google you today

<i>but nothing every comes up,
it gets boring</i>

<i>but I'll find you,
yeah, I'll find you</i>

<i>I miss you so much that it hurts...</i>

I love you so much.

<i>But I know where you'll be</i>

<i>after work...</i>

You did so good.

<i>You're the star in my sky...</i>

How'd you learn to play like that?

From grandma.
Yeah?

Can you teach me?
I will.

<i>On the fourth of July</i>

<i>you make me sing,
you make me sing</i>

<i>oh, oh, oh, oh...</i>

Brainiacs! Brainiacs!

<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

<i>sometimes I feel like</i>

<i>when I hold my breath
and count to ten...</i>

Okay, what's your next move?
Be right there with <i>me...</i>

I do remember this.

<i>All my stars
are floating overhead</i>

'cause <i>I</i> passed out again...

You can't do that!

When do I get to use this?

Are you thirsty, mijo?
Yes, please.

<i>You're like a sunny delight...</i>

Show me the home away from home.

All right.

The most powerful piece
is the queen.

You don't want to lose her.

<i>You're the star in my sky</i>

<i>you're the wink in my eye</i>

<i>you make me feel like a kid</i>

<i>that heard the ice cream truck</i>

<i>you're like a sunny delight
on the fourth of July</i>

<i>you make me sing,
you make me sing...</i>

<i>I'll find you...</i>

Let's enjoy life.
