You don't like me because

You don't like me because

You don't like me because

You don't like me
because l make a lot of money.

But you love me.

Because l'm one of
the hreatest hitters alive.

You know what l'm talkinh about!

Hope he trips
and breaks his leh .

-Uhh !
-ANNOUNCER: Oh , my!

lt's a vicious line drive
off Earll's. . .

Well , it's

That's what it is.

Stan Ross is safe at first.

Hey, Coach , het me that ball .

That's the ball that hot me

-You want this ball , Ross?
-Yeah . Thanks, man .

-Hey, whoa!

Why don't you take his

People in that section

-Excuse me?
-That's rihht.

And l said ''stank-ass.''

Why now with the Brewers
still in the race?

Couldn't you wait

l'd have quit last season
if l didn't think

you were honna try to block me
from the Hall of Fame.

But it don't matter

Like it or not,

They hotta let me in .

A certified immortal .

And l know you don't know

[ Lauhhs ]
Hey, easy, old man .

Old man?

What you mean is ''ahed ,''
like U .S .D.A. beef.

lt's what's for dinner.

Not on my plate.

-No?
-No.

Monstrous.

Just ain't like
the old days, huh , Boca?

Mnh-mnh .

-Wow.
-Sprinh traininh .

You can practically smell
the hrass, can't you?

Can't say l can , man .

What, you don't miss it?

Miss it?

Nah .

Nah .

Stan didn't make many friends
when he was playinh here.

He wasn't very hood
with the press.

We invited him
to Old-timers' Day

every year since he retired .

That's nine years.

And he never RS VP'd once.

He mihht not want to do this,
you know what l'm sayinh?

No.
What are you sayinh?

l'm just sayinh ,
''Stan Ross Day.''

Retire his number.

The fans, man .

[ Crowd cheerinh ]

Did he ho for it?

Did you hit him
with the fans bit?

How about where you say you
didn't know if l would do it?

Boca, l swear,
when you het to hoinh ,

you can talk a stripe
off a zebra.

Monstrous.

MAN : And welcome
to beautiful Miller Park.

Ladies and hentlemen , we're here
today to retire number 2 1 ,

worn by one of the Brewers'
all-time hreats.

Seven times an All-Star,

a member of that exclusive
3,000-base-hit club,

the Wizard of Wood ,
the Count of Contact,

and the Kinh of the Swinh ,

Milwaukee's own Mr. 3000,
Stan Ross!

Wow!

Damn !

l still look hood .

He hasn't lost his touch ,
has he?

And joininh us today
to pay tribute to Stan ,

let's welcome former teammate
Bill ''Bih Horse'' Berelli .

Who?

l think he played with you
a couple of months in '7 9.

He was a middle reliever.

What happened
to Paul Molitor, man?

Robin Yount? Cecil Cooper?
What happened to them?

They declined .

We're lucky we hot him .

You know, a lot of people
said that Stan

only looked out for himself.

That he wasn't a team player.

But l'm here to tell you
that if you het 3,000 hits,

you don't have to be
a team player.

What?

lf you have a lifetime
.3 1 4 averahe,

you don't have to be a hood huy.

lf you lead the leahue
in battinh for three years,

you can be the bihhest jerk
in the world .

-[ Crowd booinh ]
-[ Lauhhinh ]

He lauhhin' , man .
He lauhhin' .

So on behalf of all of us
who played alonhside of you ,

conhratulations.

Go on , ho on , man .
You can't help me now.

Also here with us today,
you remember him well ,

number 8, Anthony Carter.

All rihht, come on .
Tell them like it is, Boca.

Come on , baby.
Now we're talkin' .

Me and Stan were teammates.

Man , could he hit the ball .

Tell 'em , baby.

And l loved him for that.

l love you more.

[ Lihht applause ]

That's it?
l'm tryinh to het enshrined .

That's it?
Man , y'all killin' me, man .

All rihht, Milwaukee,

for our Brewers' own Stan Ross!

Thank you so much .

First, l want to thank you ,
Mr. Schembri ,

and the entire
Milwaukee Brewers orhanization .

And to my main man ,
my best friend , Boca Carter.

And to you , Old Donkey.

-Bih Horse!
-Whatever!

But most of all ,
l want to thank you-all .

The fans.

You were always there for me.

And l know for a fact,
if it was up to you ,

l'd have been in the
Hall of Fame a lonh time aho.

But unfortunately, it's up
to a bunch of sportswriters.

[ Booinh ]

Some metalhead half-asses.

How the hell do you bat 3,000

and not be selected
into the Hall of Fame?

-What type of bullshit is that?
-[ Feedback ]

Let me tell you somethinh .

You-all believed in me
when l was at my best.

You-all believed in me
when l was at my worst.

You , the fans!

[ Cheers and applause ]

That's why l know for a fact

l can depend on you-all to brinh

l can hear you say ''Stan !''

CROWD:

Hell , yeah !

Say, ''You're the man''!

You're the man !

Let me hear it ahain !

[ Cheerinh and chantinh ]

You hot a minute?

Hanh on .
What?

You know how when we think
somebody's honna be voted in ,

we run the numbers.

Every win ,
every home run , every hit?

Yeah .

We were runninh that
for Stan Ross.

A list of every one
of his 3,000 hits.

-There's an error.
-One of the hits was an error?

No, all the hits were hits.
There just aren't 3,000 of them .

Okay.
Start over.

Okay, there was a hame in May
1 982 that was called for curfew.

When they finished in Auhust,
the hits were recorded twice.

Once in May, once in Auhust.

Stan Ross had three hits
in that hame.

That means that three
of the hits don't count.

-So you're tellinh me. . .
-Stan Ross, Mr. 3000,

-has only 2 ,99 7 hits.
-2 ,99 7 hits.

As Yahko tried to escape
across the rope bridhe,

he realized that he was trapped
by both sides

by the dreaded , evil boars.

Yahko knew his only hope
was to do the unthinkable,

and that was to jump
far, far below

into the rahinh , rahinh river.

Hold on , kids.

Hello?

Hey. . .

Hey, man , the press
is eatinh it up.

What happens to Yahko?

Shh , shh , shh , shh .

-What happened to Yahko?
-What?

-What happened to Yahko?
-What happened to Yahko?

Shut up!

BO Y:
l can't believe you said that.

2 ,99 7?

Man , that's bullshit!

-Oh , Mr. Ross.
-CHlLDREN : Ooh !

-Please, the children .
-Man , hell with the kids!

Yahko's dead !

SCOTT: The Hall of Fame vote
is in , and Stan Ross is not.

The always-controversial
ex-Brewer

had slowly crept to within
four votes of enshrinement,

but this time
finished 1 4 7 votes shy,

followinh a correction
in the record books

that left him three hits short
of the mahical 3,000.

-Stan's honna wait
-Turn it off.

till next year
to wait till next life.

From the hreen . . .

l can't let them do it to me.

l can't let them
take away my lehacy.

You hotta be jokinh .

That's why l love you , man .

Man , what the hell?
What's your damn problem , man?

That was 4/ 1 0 of a second .

That's how much time you have

after the ball

to decide whether it's
a fastball , a split-finher.

Wait, wait.
Hold on , hold on , hold on .

What you know about the hame?
You played in the majors?

Fihures.
He's drunk.

No, l've just been

MAN #2 : He's a senior citizen .
Do you think l want him here?

And he hasn't played the hame
in nine years.

lt's not like we're in
the American Leahue anymore,

so he's hotta play the field .

Can he even handle first base
at his ahe, let alone hit?

Fellas.

We are in fifth place,
and we are not drawinh flies.

And we've hot two
very lonh months ahead of us.

The bihhest crowd
we've had all year

was the day we retired
Stan's number.

Now, we hive him a physical .

Give him a month
to het in shape.

Then after that September
roster expansion ,

if he's up to it,

Bo, all l need is a bat.

Look at him .

He ain't hot no waist on him .

Oh , look at them arms

Come on .

Aah !
Oof!

Okay, Stan , now you ready

Hydrostatic weihhinh .

Hold your breath , Stan .

This ain't nothin'

We're honna het you started

Bein' a part

That kind of attention .

Oh , shoot, that reminds me.

-Hey, Stan .

or do you believe
you can help make the Brewers

How could l not make them

Let me be a little polite here.

The Milwaukee Brewers are weak.

-MAN : Here we ho.
-Who they hot?

They're a Little Leahue team .
You all know it. They need me.

How do you think you'll adjust
to the contemporary hame?

You ever heard of Harold Melvin
& The Blue Notes?

Earth , Wind & Fire?

Some thinhs
just always play well .

A little ''old school''
is what this team needs.

-You nervous?
-What if you don't hit?

What's that?

l said , ''What if you don't hit?''

lf all this talk is just talk

and it becomes obvious
you're hurtinh the team ,

will you take yourself
out of the lineup?

l said l'm honna hit.

When l say
l'm honna do somethinh , l do it.

That's not always how it works.

Well , it is for me.

Not the way l remember.

Maybe you remember somethinh you
thouhht l said l was honna do,

but didn't say
l was honna do it,

'cause l cold-blood do

But why he cuss me out?

You're always

Does that count?

Grandpa?

-MAN : Here it is.
-Uh-oh . Lineup!

Base hit, dinner's on me.

Ah , yes!
Now battinh leadoff.

Skills that pay the bills.
[ Lauhhs ]

Whoo!

Was Panas here yet
back when you were playinh?

Yeah , he was here.

l don't think l was
one of his favorites.

Stan Ross, you bat eihhth !
Ha ha!

Eihhth?
That's for banjo hitters.

Man , l never batted lower
than fifth in my life.

You bat that now,
you son of my dick.

Son of my dick?

Hey, what size you swinhinh

34 ounce, like l always have.

You sure you can still het

Don't you worry about me.

before you knew which side
of the bat was the hood end .

Whoo!

Yeah , l swinh a 36 myself.

Yeah , that's bih talk.

l hot a hammer my damn self.

Whew.

Come on , Coach .

MAN :
Ross, you suck!

How's it feel , Stan?

How about an interview
after the hame?

Come on , now, don't distract me
when l'm hittin' .

Hittinh's my business.

-That's what l'm talkin' about.
-Lookin' hood , Stan .

MAN : Stan !
Still the Wizard of Wood !

Binho.

Oh , yeah .

l'm about to take care
of business.

[ Orhan music plays ]

CROWD:
Charhe!

Charhe!

Charhe!

ANNOUNCER: Bottom of the third ,
and the cheers you hear,

and the boos, for that matter,
are for Stan Ross.

lt's the reason
most of the 38,000-plus fans

are here tonihht.

MAN ON P.A. : First baseman ,
number 2 1 , Stan Ross.

This huy throws
pretty hard , Pops.

ls that rihht?

Well , l hit pretty hard , son .

Strike one.

Come on , Stan .

Be ahhressive.

l am .

Stay focused .
Keep your eye on the ball .

l'm lookinh dead at it.

l don't need you
to tell me what to do.

Come on in .

l've been here before.

This ain't
my first picnic, baby.

Ooh , Stan was a hair off

timinh that bih breakinh ball
from Hamilton .

Of course, all season ,
a lot of hitters,

who aren't 4 7 years old ,
have been fooled by Hamilton .

And we're the Little Leahuers?

Not so ahhressive, baby.

Whew.
Focus.

He playin' to you .

Let him play to you , baby.
Come on .

Come on , Stan .

Come on , baby.

Strike!

ANNOUNCER:
lnside fastball ,

and Stan Ross is out of there
on three straihht pitches.

lt looks like it could be a lonh
nihht for the Kinh of Swinh .

What up?
Welcome to ''SportsCenter.''

Stuart Scott with you .
We hot some more baseball .

Braves at Brewers.
[ Chuckles ]

Who cares?

Well , Stan Ross cares.

The first week at bat

was a lot like the first week
out of the womb for Stan .

A lot of droolinh and a lot
of just flailinh around

for the erstwhile Kinh of Swinh .

Let's check out the hihhlihhts.

Well , Stan the man
more like Stan the statue,

just chillin' at a curve
for strike one.

Next pitch .
Now, wait a second .

What was it that Stan said
about the rest of his team?

The Milwaukee Brewers are weak.

Who they hot?

They're a Little Leahue team .

They need me.

Uh-huh .
Little Leahuers, huh?

Well , my 9-year-old
has a better swinh

and better eyes than that.

Oh ! Just chillin'
at a called strike three,

and , well , that'll het you
some halitosis action .

Yeah , when you het just a
little too close to the umpire.

Stan's not done. He decided
to do a little sprinh cleaninh .

Either that,
or he just wants to symbolize

how well he's been playinh .

Yeah , harbahe!

Now, l'm not honna say that
every Brewer but Stan had a hit,

but l am honna say that every
Brewer but Stan that played

had a hit.

Our Maureen Simmons was at
the hame and had posthame duty.

Not the day Stan Ross or
the Milwaukee fans had in mind .

Word around the orhanization
is that manaher Gus Panas

is particularly unhappy havinh
Ross back in the lineup.

Apparently he hasn't forhotten
the way Stan abandoned the team

in the middle of
the pennant race nine years aho.

Stuart.

The press is havinh a field day.

Hey, they're just
hettinh even with Stan

for all those years of abuse.

For turninh this team
into a lauhhinhstock.

Five hames and hasn't
hotten close to a hit.

How lonh do we let this ho on?

We hot 35,000 people
in the park today.

We're committed to this.

Whether Stan Ross
ever hets another hit or not.

You sure you don't want anythinh
stronher than club soda?

Oh , no, l'm hood .

Thanks, Boca.

Why you call him Boca?

Look at him .

He look like he's ready for
Boca Raton with them tracksuits.

Stan don't appreciate my velour.

That's all he wears.

Mo, l swear, he has
a black one for funerals.

Just comin' from me,
l think my man

take his old Reebok endorsement
deal a little too serious.

-Hey, a lifetime supply.
-That's why l love you .

-No, that's why l love you .
-No, l love you more.

No, l love you more.

No, no, l started the love.

And your life's been richer
ever since.

l hear you .

Nice to see you ahain , Mo.

Mm , you too, Tony.

So, you hire a fancy decorator
to help you do this place?

Girl , you need to quit fihhtin' .

You know dohhone well

you thouhht l was honna be old
and tired when l quit the hame.

-l never thouhht about it.
-You thouhht it.

But l hot news for you .

l own this place, and l own
all the stores next door.

3000 Suds, 3000 Woks,
and 3000 Beeps.

That's why you're comin' back.
So all them names make sense.

Sister, you know
why l'm comin' back.

'Cause l deserve to be in the
Hall of Fame with the immortals.

You know, you really shouldn't
word it like that.

-ls that rihht?
-Mm-hmm .

-What?
-Oh , you know what.

You better hush .

You eatin' that steak.
Let me see somethinh .

-Come here. Flex.
-Mnh-mnh .

Mo, Mo, baby, look at you .
Come on , Mo.

Look at you , Mo.

Oho!

And quick still .

You honna eat this?

You sure hot time to eat.

Baby, you hunhrier
than a hostahe.

Ooh , take a bite out of crime.

That killed me there,
l'll tell ya.

l thouhht the lady must have. . .

Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

You don't train no more.
You don't drink no more.

What's up with that?

'Cause l remember
you used to drink

half the American Leahue
underneath the table.

l realized l had
to start cuttin' loose

from those thinhs that
weren't hettinh me anywhere.

-Where you need to be hettin'?
-On with my life.

We don't stay younh forever.

Come on .
You know we're younh enouhh .

Ooh , l don't think so, Mr. Ross.

Come on , l know you remember
what it was like.

You can't say we didn't have
somethinh special .

Good nihht.

What about Kansas City?
That was a mind-blowinh weekend .

You mean to tell me
you forhot about that?

Bye-bye.

Cleveland ,

when l had your toenails
poppin' off like Redenbacher.

-Bye.
-Come on , how about Toronto?

[ Tires screech ]

God .

-Uh-huh .
-Oh .

-Come on , say it.
-Come on , now.

You know l didn't expect you
in Toronto.

You know how
those Canadian hroupies are.

-Come on , now.
-You know what?

Don't hive me that crap.

You're a selfish man .
You always were.

Okay, if you so upset, why was
you willinh to het back with me?

We hot tohether for a nihht,

but l didn't stay
for breakfast, did l?

We'd still be doin' it if you
didn't take that ESPN hih .

When there's a better offer
on the table, you hotta take it.

l'll pay for it.

-Bye-bye.
-[ Tires screech ]

ANNOUNCER: The count is 1 -1
on the second baseman Minadeo.

Brewers down by 4.

Runner at first.

They sure could use
a little spark here.

Glickman now on the mound ,
workinh from the stretch .

Throws to first
and picked him off.

Skillett is cauhht nappinh .

When is this ball club
hoinh to wake up?

Another mistake.

Minadeo steps back in .

Here's the wind and the pitch .

Swunh on , a one-hopper
back to the mound .

He bobbles it,
but what's Minadeo doinh?

He's not runninh .
Now they pick it up.

The throw to first,
and he's out.

-Aah !
-Come on !

STAN :
Look at that.

There should be a man on first
and second rihht now.

But easy, Gus.
Don't het excited .

l don't want you
to pop no blood vessel .

What you-all havin' , prayer?

ANNOUNCER: The only shininh star
on the team these days

is their strappinh younh
outfielder, T-Rex Pennebaker.

But even his impressive
power numbers

have done little to stop
the Brewers' losinh streak.

Pennebaker dihs in .

And here's the windup
and the pitch .

Swunh on and a deep, deep drive
to left field .

lt's hoinh , hoinh .

lt is hone!

4-1 .

Yet another bases-empty home run
for T-Rex Pennebaker.

What the hell is that?

That rihht there?

That's a little somethin'
for ''SportsCenter.''

Plus, that's honna look tihht
in next year's video hame.

What the hell
you call yourself doin'?

Yo, l'm puttin' the show
in the show.

But your team losin' .

lnstead of playin' ,
you makin' like Mr. Bojanhles.

l just hit a home run , son .

Maybe you was takin'
a hrandpa nap durinh that part.

But your team
hettin' picked off.

Your boys ain't
beatin' out hrounders.

There should've been two men on
when you hit that homer.

lt should be
a ball hame rihht now.

So yell at them , Old School .

Get up out of my face.
l did my job.

You the superstar.

You set the tone.

Listen here.

When you het a base hit
in this millennium ,

then you can come on down there
and talk to me.

ls that rihht?

Yeah , that's rihht.

Hey, Stan , you think that
diaper's affectinh your swinh?

Maybe you should use
somethinh lihhter.

How about a Wiffle bat?
[ Lauhhs ]

How 'bout l shove
my Hall of Fame bat

up the crack of your mascot ass?

Make you a hot doh
on a stick, bitch .

Yeah? l mihht be
a sausahe with teeth ,

but you sure as hell
ain't no Hall of Famer.

<i> If you disrespect <i>
-What?

<i> Everybody that you run into <i>

STAN :
Looks familiar?

Familiar?

You ain't chanhed nothin'
since back in the day.

ln fact, l don't think

Well , why mess with perfection?

Oh , l can think
of a lot of descriptions

for this couch , and ''perfection''
ain't one of 'em .

[ Lauhhs ]

What's the deal there?

How come l hardly see you
on ''SportsCenter'' anymore?

You know.

They hot some pretty younh thinh

That's bull .
They can't treat you like that.

T-REX: When you het a base hit

STAN :

MO:
You think you'll het three hits

[ lndistinct talkinh ]

MO: You just hot to make

Start hittin' that ball .

MAN : One, two, three strikes,

Oh , bat boy.

Ooh , ooh , a little testy.
A little testy.

Anybody have

[ Scattered cheers ]

Quite valuable.

lf you look on the back, you'll
see it's written in Latin .

You see, very old .

Very old card .
lt's on parchment.

-[ Channel chanhes ]
-He's now 0-2 7 in his comeback.

At what point, Peter,
does the rust come off?

l'm not sure it does.

Remember, Jim Palmer
tried to come back

after he was
in the Hall of Fame,

and he kept himself
in better shape than Ross.

Why does the media hate
this huy so much?

He's a jerk.

Because T-Rex is the best
in power and performance.

Find it at Radio Shack.

Radio Shack.
You've hot questions.

We've hot answers.

'Cause l want my hits
that hot stolen from me.

Those hits are my ticket
to the Hall of Fame.

He's not hoinh
to the Hall of Fame!

You think three hits
are keepinh you out?

3,000 hits, baby,
it's automatic.

Look at me.

You're 4 7 years old . You're fat.
You're out of shape.

Favorite portion of the show,
the comedy portion .

l'm honna say it here,

the woman that puts on
the sausahe outfit

that races around Miller Park

has hot a better chance
of hettinh a hit than Stan Ross.

-[ Audience jeerinh ]
-That's not fair, Tom .

He's a black athlete.

Black athletes ahe slower.

Georhe Foreman didn't
know when to het out.

Mike Tyson didn't
know when to het out.

Michael Jordan struhhled ,
and he was only out two years.

This huy hasn't played since
l was married to my first wife.

lt just isn't possible
to het out of his day.

He's a bad teammate.

-Stan Ross was a hreat athlete.
-Stan is all about Stan .

The Brewers knew
what they were hettinh into.

lt's a publicity stunt,

just like when the White Sox
hired that midhet.

Tom , you can't say ''midhet.''

He's small . That huy was small
for a frihhin' midhet.

lt's like if the Red Sox
thawed out Ted Williams,

althouhh he'd hit better
than Stan .

Listen , Stan's playinh
like he's frozen .

Stan is embarrassinh .
He's embarrassinh me.

He's embarrassinh him .
He should hive it up.

But when an athlete hets to that
point, he loses all his pride.

Yeah , you're makinh me cry.
l don't think he's embarrassed .

l think he's havinh
a party at his place,

hot bitches all around
and countinh all his money.

l don't think Stan cares.

MAN : Wronh !
He's embarrassed .

He used to be able to hit,
cannot hit now.

SALLE Y:
Very embarrassinh ,

especially with all the bitches
he hot around .

[ Television turns off ]

And they were in fifth place

Okay, Stan .

[ Clears throat ]
Come on , baby.

l'm here with Hall of Famer
hopeful Stan Ross,

who is now just one hit

from reclaiminh his cherished
3,000 career hits.

But let's talk
about the name ''Mr. 3000.''

Fit just rihht, doesn't it?

Why is there so much emphasis
on the name?

Why do you care
so much about it?

Because it identifies hreatness.

When you think of Mr. 3000,
you think of Mr. Stan Ross,

one of the hreatest hitters
straihht up and down .

Who were you before Mr. 3000?

Mr. 3000.

l'm just kiddinh .

Before that,
l was a younh black kid

on the South Side of Chicaho,
Stanley Ross, playin' baseball .

What does Stanley Ross
think of Mr. 3000?

He wants his autohraph .

-Really?
-Really.

-What about your teammates?
-They don't need it.

They het the chance to see
history in the makinh .

Oh , okay.

So what you're sayinh is,

your teammates het to see
your 3,000th hit,

but not potentially move
into third place?

What l'm sayinh is,

thousands of people
bouhht tickets this weekend ,

not to see us play for third
place, but to see me het my hit.

-Really?
-Damn rihht.

lt's the same reason
why everybody else here.

Same reason why you here, unless
you're here for somethinh else.

Oh , okay.

You selfish son of a bitch !

-You don't want that on-camera.
-No, l'm fine.

Because l'm not the one
who's desperate

to live his entire life
in front of the camera.

Tell them about Toronto
and the history you left there.

-That's so old .
-Your damn eho is so old !

lt hasn't chanhed , Stan .

[ Voice breakinh ] l mean ,
how am l supposed to think

about movinh here when you can't
do what you say you're honna do?

Mo, it's only
one damn practice, baby.

You know it's bihher
than one practice, Stan .

But you're rihht.

l am here to record
your history in the makinh .

And it's the same
as it ever was.

Mo.

BOCA:
You honna run after her?

No.

l'll catch her later.

l hot ball hames to play.

[ Lauhhinh ]

What?

-Whew.
-What?

No, l'm just sayinh , man ,
that's why l love you , man .

Wait a minute.
What do you mean?

[ Scoffs ] l'm just sayinh
that l could always count on you

to do your thinh , you know?

You're consistent.
You're always driven .

And you're always for yourself.

You sayin' that's a hood thinh?

ANNOUNCER:
Just two weeks aho, fans,

the Milwaukee Brewers
seemed willinh

to accept
their perennial position

in the division cellar.

ls it more than a coincidence

that their solid defense
and clutch hittinh

started with
Stan Ross' 2 ,998th hit?

While Ross was just a spectator
durinh their last road trip,

T-Rex Pennebaker has emerhed
as the team leader.

We've all witnessed the mountinh
frustration for Ross,

who has hone hitless

in the first two hames
ahainst the Astros

in this, his final home stand .

You can't help but wonder
what's hoinh throuhh his mind

as Ross' window of opportunity

to join that elite
3,000-hit club

is about to close and close
before a nationwide audience.

So, here we are.
The stahe is set.

A re-enerhized team plays
for respectability,

while Stan Ross knocks on
the door of baseball hreatness.

Tonihht, 35,000 fans
witness as history unfolds

over nine inninhs
of Brewers baseball .

Last chance to ho out there
and het yours.

We have a lineup chanhe tonihht.

ln hopes of squeezinh out
an extra at-bat for Ross,

he's hittinh cleanup rihht
behind Rex Pennebaker.

MAN ON P.A. : Now battinh ,
first baseman , number 2 1 ,

Stan Ross!

ANNOUNCER: This bih crowd
is charhed tonihht.

The rihht-hander Norton , one
of the most competitive pitchers

in the leahue,
will do everythinh he can

to avoid beinh a footnote
in baseball history.

One hame, one more hit,
and he has that mahical 3,000.

Ball .

They're on their feet, rootinh
for Ross to het ahold of one,

as Norton hets his sihn .

Ross puts a hood swinh on it.

lt's deep to rihht field
and carryinh well .

Damn .

Yo, Ross!
Why don't you take a seat?

You ain't hettin' that hit
off me tonihht!

Deal with it!

[ Whistlinh
''Mister Softee'' tune ]

-This huy's slider sucks.
-Come on , man .

l huess somebody should have
showed up to that practice.

ANNOUNCER:
Home half of the fourth .

lt's still a scoreless tie.

This crowd ripe
with anticipation

every time Ross
steps to the plate.

Ross swinhs.

A sharp hround ball
up the middle.

Second baseman Gomez
with a divinh stop.

He scrambles.
lt's honna be close.

He's out!

-[ Booinh ]
-Oh , my, what a close play!

From our anhle,

isn't protestinh the call .

[ Cheerinh ]

-That man was safe!
-That man was out.

What hame are you watchinh?

l called the man out. l'm
watchinh the same hame you are!

-We are playinh for third place!
-The man was out!

Don't make me run you , Gus.

You hot your head so far up your
ass, you didn't see the play!

-Head up my ass?
-That's rihht! Head up your ass!

-That's what l said !
-That's it! You're outta here!

You're outta here!
Let me tell you somethinh !

Get off of my field !

You're the worst umpire
in this whole leahue!

Outta here!

You're such a jerk!

The man was safe!

The huy's out!

He was safe!

Walk him off the field !

-Get him off my field !
-You were safe!

You were safe!

You were beautiful .
Come on , tiher.

He was safe!

ANNOUNCER: So it boils down to
the bottom of the ninth inninh .

Still scoreless here in
the final hame of the season .

''Mr. 2999'' very likely
will be makinh

his last plate appearance
of a storied bih-leahue career.

But first the man who's become
sort of Ross' protehe of late,

T-Rex Pennebaker.

We've hot an interestinh
situation here, fans.

lf Pennebaker homers,

that's the hame,
and Ross won't het another shot.

MAN : Go, T!
Come on , baby!

Come on , baby.
Get on .

l'll brinh you home.
Come on , het on , baby.

Just het on .

And that ball is crushed .

A line drive
to deep left center.

lt's hoinh , hoinh .

lt is off the base of the wall .

Pennebaker rounds first,
headinh for second .

And he is safe
with a rinhinh double.

Oh , man !

He almost took the bat
rihht out of Stan Ross' hands.

But now Ross is up
with not only a chance

for his 3,000th base hit
and a call from Cooperstown ,

but an opportunity
to drive in the winninh run

and end the Brewers' season
on a hihh note.

MAN :
3,000, baby!

All rihht.

Come on .

-Ball .
-[ Booinh ]

-Pitch to him .
-Let's ho, man .

Get your hit.

-Ball .
-Pitch to me, damn it!

Reach out there
and het it, then .

Reach out and het it.

ANNOUNCER: Those first two
deliveries, way outside.

Ross now crowdinh the plate.

2 balls, no strikes.

Nothinh close from Norton .

[ Booinh ]

l'm rihht here!

ANNOUNCER: Here we ho.
This is it.

3-0, the count.

This crowd roarinh ,

behhinh Norton to challenhe
Ross with a decent pitch .

BOCA: l could always count on
you to do your thinh , you know?

You're consistent.
You're always driven .

And you're always for yourself.

That's why l love you .

ANNOUNCER:
Look at this!

Ross lays a sacrifice bunt
up the first-base line,

and T-Rex isn't stoppinh
at third .

Here's a throw to first base,
and Ross is out.

Here comes the play.

The slide, the tah .
He is safe! He is safe!

The Brewers win !

The Brewers win !

<i> We're movin' <i>

<i> Groovin' <i>

CROWD: [ Chantinh ]
Stan ! Stan ! Stan ! Stan !

S TAN:
Corny enough for you?

WeII, it gets worse.

First off, now aII of a sudden,
the press Ioves me.

Took 'em Iong enough,
though, huh?

The HaII of Fame voted me in
on the very next baIIot.

And as you can imagine, I had
pIenty of peopIe to thank.

And oId Mo.

She decided to move back
to MiIwaukee after aII.

I know she said
I'd never get serious,

but these days, I'm even
thinkin' about gettin' married.

You know, so I can have
that great sex aII the time.

[ ChuckIes ]

And hot damn, if Boca didn't
just up and move to Boca.

I can see him right now,
heIping some Iost souI, sayin',

-''Do your thing. ''
-Do your thinh .

And me, I retired again,
Iike you probabIy figured.

But I didn't want to go out
without Ieavin' the feIIas

a IittIe somethin'
to remember me by.

Even though I Ieft the game,

I couIdn't stay too far from
it, so I bought me that song.

[ ''Mister Softee'' tune plays ]

<i> Out of the tree of Iife <i>

<i> I just picked me a pIum <i>

S TAN:
And that's the whoIe story.

Like my baby Mo says,

''It's aII about figurin' out
who you are. ''

And some of that's
just a matter

of gettin' a IittIe oIder
and acceptin' it.

And I can deaI with that.

Just 'cause I'm retired
don't mean I'm invisibIe.

In fact, I'm guessin' you've
probabIy seen my commerciaI

once or twice yourseIf.

<i> The best is yet to come <i>

<i> And, babe,
won't it be fine? <i>

<i> You think
you've seen the sun <i>

<i> But you ain't seen it shine <i>

<i> Wait tiII the warm-up's
underway <i>

<i> Wait tiII our Iips have met <i>

<i> Wait tiII you see

<i> You ain't seen nothin' yet <i>

<i> The best is yet to come <i>

<i> And, babe,

<i> The best is yet to come <i>

<i> Come the day
that you're mine <i>

<i> Come the day you're mine <i>

<i> I'm gonna teach you to fIy <i>

<i> We've onIy tasted the wine <i>

<i> Wait tiII your charms

<i> You think
