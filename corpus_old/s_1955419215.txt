JAMES PRESTON
DENVER, COLORADO
RATE 2 MECHANICAL ENGINEER

Good Morning, James!

How're you feeling?

Wait, what?

It's perfectly normal to feel confused.

You've just spent a 120 years
in suspended animation.

What?

It's okay, James.

It's Jim.

Jim.

Just breathe.

Everything is okay.

Where am I?

You're a passenger on the Starship Avalon.

The Homestead Company's
premier interstellar star liner.

We've nearly completed the voyage
from Earth to your new home,

the colony world of Homestead II.

A new world.

A fresh start.

Room to grow.

Oh, yeah.

The Avalon is on final approach.

For the next 4 months,
you'll enjoy space travel

at it's most luxurious.

Food. Fun.
Friends.

My friends.

That's right, Jim.

The I.D. band on your wrist is your key
to the wonders of the Avalon.

You're in perfect health, Jim.

Let's get you to your cabin
where you can get some rest.

You maybe experiencing post-hibernation sickness.

Your door will be lite up for you.

Welcome to your cabin.

Your home until we make landfall.

Over the next 4 months, you'll prepare
for your new life on Homestead II.

Meet you fellow passengers,
take skill building classes

and learn about colonial living.

You've been assigned to Learning group 38,

for passengers with engineering
and technical trade skills.

Please scan your I.D.
to confirm luggage delivery.

Jim, please scan your I.D.
to confirm luggage delivery.

To help you recover from hibernation,
be sure to drink plenty of fluids

Enjoy the rest of your voyage
on the Avalon,

a Homestead Company Starship

Good morning one and all.

It's a beautiful morning
here on the Starship Avalon.

Whatever you do don't get homesick,
get Homestead.

Let start with an ensemble,
one of my favorite back on Earth.

Just call me... call me Jim.
You got a cool jacket.

Hello, Passengers.

Will you all
please take a seat.

Welcome, Learning group 38.

Your introduction to colonial life.

Earth is a prosperous planet.

The cradle of civilization.

But for many, it's also overpopulated.
Over-priced. Overrated.

I'm sorry,
I think I maybe in the wrong...

No questions until the end, please.
Oh, sorry.

The Colonies offer an alternative.

A better way of life.
Where are all the other...

And there's no colony
more beautiful than Homestead II,

the Jewel of the Occupied Worlds.
It's fine.

Where IS everybody?

We're all on the Starship Avalon.

But I'm the only one here.

There are 5,000 passengers
and 258 crew members.

So why am I alone?

We're all in this together.

Hello?

Anybody here?

Hello?

Please buckle up and
secure any loose items.

This elevator will experience
a momentary lapse in gravity.

Grand Concourse.

Welcome to the Grand Concourse
aboard the Avalon, can I help you?

I need to talk to a person.

A real live person, please.

What sort of person? Personal trainer?
Travel planner? Therapist?

I don't know.
Somebody in charge.

The Ship Steward handles passenger affairs.
It's on level 3 of the Grand Concourse.

Thank you.
Happy to help!

Not good.

Hello!
Who's flying the ship?

The flight crew, the Captain,
the Pilot, the Chief Navigator...

I want to talk to the Captain.

The Captain rarely handles
passenger queries directly.

It's an emergency, please.

The Captain is usually found on the
Bridge, in the Command Deck.

Bridge access requires special authorization.

Bridge access requires special authorization.

You got to be kidding me.

Welcome to the Observatory.

What can I show you?

We're supposed to land soon,

I'm... I'm the only one awake.

I don't understand.
What can I show you?

Show me Homestead II.

Homestead II is the 4th planet
in the Bhakti system.

Right.
And where are we?

We've been transit
from Earth to Homestead II.

We will arrive in approximately 90 years.
What?

We arrive at Homestead II
in 90 years, 3 weeks and 1 day.

No.
Wait. How long ago did we leave Earth?

Approximately 30 years ago.

I woke up too soon.

Hello.

How do I send a
message to Earth?

Interstellar messages are sent by laser array.
This is an expensive service.

Bite me.
Happy to help!

Planet and connection?

Earth.
The HomeStead Company.

There are 30,826 contacts
listed under â€œHomeStead Company.â€

I'm emigrating to Homestead II.
I have an emergency.

I have a Customer Help Line.
Sounds about right.

Begin message.

Hi.
I'm Jim Preston.

I'm a passenger on the Avalon.

And uh...

I think something went wrong
with my hibernation pod.

I woke up too soon.

And I mean...
way too soon.

Nobody else is awake.
And...

I don't know how
to get back to sleep.

And the thing is,
there's 90 years to go.

At this rate, I'm...

I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix this.
I...

Maybe I missed something.
I could use a hand.

That's all.

Thank you.

Message sent.

Outstanding.

Message will arrive in 19 years.
Wait, what?

Earliest reply in 55 years.
55 years.

We apologize for the delay.

That will be $6012 dollars.

Afternoon.
Oh man.

It's good to see another face.

I thought I was
the only one awake!

Who want's to sleep
on a beautiful day like this?

Oh, I mean we're in trouble,
we're not suppose to be here.

Well, I won't tell if you don't.

Huh?
Our little secret.

What can I get for you?

What?
You look like a whiskey man.

Okay.

Oh, you're a robot.

Android, technically.

 Arthur's the name.

Jim.
Please to meet you, Jim.

How much do you know
about this ship?

I don't know.
I know some things.

What do I do if
my hibernation pod malfunctions?

Oh.
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

They never malfunction.
Yeah, well, I woke up early.

Can't happen.

How long until we get to Homestead II?

About 90 years or so.

And when are all the passengers
supposed to wake up?

Not until the last 4 months.

How is it that I'm sitting here with you
with 90 years to go?

It's not possible for you to be here.

But I am.

Good morning, it's a beautiful day
here on the Avalon.

So wake up, sunshine.
It's time to relax and enjoy your stay.

Please make a selection.

Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.

Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.

I want the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme,
bill my room please.

Food can be purchase in the ship's...

Sorry.
The French Roast...

Sorry.
The Pumpkin Spice...

Sorry.
Vanilla Chai...

Sorry.
Sorry.

Sorr... Sorr... Sorry.

Large coffee. Please enjoy your coffee.
Cream. Sugar.

Grand Concourse.

I'm screwed, Arthur.
Completely and ridiculously screwed.

Come on, now.
Every cloud has a silver lining.

Guess, I'm going to die
of old age on this ship!

Oh, we all die.

Even androids end up
on the scrap heap.

I'm the only customer,
why are you always polishing a glass?

Trick of the trade.

Makes people nervous when
a bartender just stands there.

So, lay some bartender wisdom on me.
I'm lost in space here.

You're not where you want to be.

You feel like you're supposed
to be somewhere else.

You said it.
Well.

Say you could snap your fingers and
be wherever you wanted to be.

I'll bet you'd still feel this way.
Not in the right place.

The point is, you can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

that you forget how to make
the most of where you are.

What are you telling me?

Take a break from worrying
about what you can't control.

Live a little.

Live a little.

Welcome to the BM suite.

Oh yeah.

What?

Make that a double jumbo shrimp.
Triple.

Thank you very much.

Phantom.

Alright.

I did exactly what you did.

Large coffee.

A margarita, please.

You have Han many, SeÃ±or.

Oh Hector, please.
Another one.

Yes, SeÃ±or.

Thank you.

Get out of here!

Come back.
Hey.

Come here.

Damn!

Welcome, Jim.

Please turn your attention to the
screen displaying safety tips.

These space suits are designed to withstand
the harsh environment of space.

The carbon fiber and body armor...

Slide the handle on the right

We hope you decide to join us again soon

<font color="#80ffff">AURORA LANE</font>

Aurora.

Searching passenger profiles.

I'm Aurora Lane.

Passenger 1456.
I'm a writer.

I think we tell each other stories
to know we're not alone.

 To make contact.

Your father was Oliver Lane,
the Pulitzer Prize-winning author.

No pressure, right?

My Dad used to say:

"If you live an ordinary life,
all you have are ordinary stories.

You have to live
a life of adventure."

So.

Here I am.

Good Morning.

We're starting over...
in every way.

I'll have to figure out where to live,
how to live,

who my friends will be.

It's like the first day at school.

And this school bus took
120 years to get there.

We're creating a culture.

You are funny.

Do you ever read something and
feel like it's written just for you?

I don't do a lot of reading.

She is good.

Who's that?

Aurora.

Ah.
The sleeping girl.

You know, I'm not saying
the universe is evil

but it sure has a nasty
sense of humor.

How is that?

You get to fly to another planet,
but you'll die on the way.

And you find the perfect woman

right in front of you.

Yet, she's completely out of reach.

Yeah, I'll miss New York.

Give me a cup of coffee and
a view of the Chrysler Building,

and I can write all day.

But you have coffee on Homestead II, right?

They better have coffee, if they don't
they have to turn around and go back to Earth.

HIBERNATION POD

HIBERNATION POD

Say you were trapped
on a desert island,

you had the power to wish
somebody there with you.

You wouldn't be alone.

but you'd be stranding
another person on the island.

How do you...
Would you make the wish?

I don't know.
I've never been on an island.

Okay, well...
Yeah.

Forget the island.

Say you figured out
how to do something

that would make your life
a million times better.

But you know it's wrong,
and there's no taking it back.

How do you do the math?

Jim.
These are not robot questions.

I know how to wake Aurora up.

That seems like a fine idea.
You could use some company.

I'd be stranding her on this ship
for the rest of her life!

Oh.
Well, you can't do that.

What am I going to do?

I'm here for you.

Arthur, you're a machine.

See, you can't feel that,
you don't have feelings.

You see?

That doesn't hurt.

And you don't even mind.

She...
a person.

Don't even think about it.

No more Aurora talk.

I'm over it.

I'm moving on.

What am I going to do?
I'm going to sit and thinking about it?

I'm not going to... I can't think about it.
So I'm not going to, that's the deal.

I've made my decision.
I know what I'm doing.

I just cut it off.

I'm not...
No more.

You won't hear me bring
up her name again.

I'll never even mention
her name again.

Done.

I can't do it.

I'm shaving off my beard.

Please don't do it.

Good morning, Aurora.

How're you feeling?

It's perfectly normal to feel confused.

You've just spent a 120 years
in suspended animation.

Grand Concourse.

Hello?

Anybody?

Hello.

Hi.

Are you passenger or crew?

Passenger.

Jim Preston.

Aurora Lane.

Do you know what's going on?

Nobody else from
my row woke up.

Same for me.

The crew's supposed to wake up
a month before we do. But...

I haven't seen them.

The crew is still asleep.

Are you saying nobody's awake?

Just me.

Just you?

Just us.

But somebody's got to land
the ship in a few weeks.

We will arrive in approximately 89 years.

89 years?

The other passengers
aren't late waking up.

We were early.

We...
We need help.

Where's the crew?

The crew's in a secured
hibernation room.

Everything important, the controls,
the reactors, the engines,

it's all behind the firewall,
there's no way through.

How long have you been awake?

1 year and 3 weeks.

No.
No.

No, this can't be happening.

We have to go back to sleep.

Aurora, we can't.

We just have to
get back to our pods

and start them up again.

I can't find my pod.
I can't find my pod.

I can't find my pod.

It doesn't matter.

Aurora.
I can't find it.

Stop.
I can't find which one is mine.

Stop.
How do I know which one is mine?

You don't know.
I can't...

Stop.
It doesn't matter.

Putting somebody into hibernation
requires special equipment.

Remember the facility where they put us
under all the procedures we went through.

These pods are designed
to keep us in hibernation,

they'll wake us up
at the right time.

They can't put us back to sleep.

You don't think there's a way
back into hibernation.

No.

But there has to be.

There has to be.

9 o'clock.
Bedtime.

I know I should be
working the problem but...

I can't even keep my eyes open.

You just came out of hibernation.

It's going to be a couple
of days before you're 100%.

You should get some rest.

I think I'm going to have to.

I'll walk you to your cabin.
No, it's okay.

I'll be alright.

Okay.

Good night, Aurora.

More than a year.
I can't imagine.

It must have been
so hard for you.

It was.

Good night, Jim.

Please buckle up and
secure any loose items.

Whiskey. Neat.
Sure thing.

How's your day been?

Aurora's awake.

Congratulations.

You don't look happy.

Arthur, can you keep a secret?

Jim, I'm not just a bartender,
I'm a gentleman.

Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up.

She thinks it was an accident.
Let me tell her.

Of course.

How can there be no way to put
someone back into hibernation?

What if a pod breaks down?

No hibernation pod has malfunctioned
in thousands of interstellar flights.

Well, I'm awake.

Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

Good morning.
Have you eaten?

No, I'm starving.

And this is the dumbest machine.

Happy to help!

CRITICAL ERROR</font>

Gold-class breakfast.

Well, you're a man of simple tastes.

I'm not a gold-class passenger.

French Breakfast Puff
is above my pay grade.

What?
This whole time?

Yeah.
What can I get you?

No, I'm fine,
Stop it.

really...
Okay.

Here you go.

Yeah.

So, I was thinking.

Maybe there's another way to go to sleep.
What about the infirmary?

I've checked it out.
It's just scanners and an autodoc.

There could be another
hibernation machine in the cargo hold.

I've had that thought too.

And I read the manifests.

It's mostly farming stuff,
machines.

replacement parts for
computers in Engineering.

We're not going to find
a hibernation facility in a box.

We can build our own.
We can't.

Jim, you're not even trying!
I've tried everything.

For over a year.

I've tried everything.

Oh well, I'm not ready to give up.

Infirmary.

What about research articles,
any kind of technical documents?

Hibernation technology is proprietary.

The following articles deal with
the subject on a theoretical level.

New file.
My Voyage.

I boarded the Avalon with an idea,
a destiny.

But now, out of reach.

I've been awake for 7 days,

awake far too soon...

and I may well spend
the rest of my life here...

...in a steel world a 1,000 meters long.

There's another passenger awake.

A mechanic named Jim Preston.

He seems to have accepted our fate.

But I'm scared.

I'm fighting to stay calm.

All the other passengers will sleep
for another 90 years.

While I roam about my life on this ship...
traveling forever...

never arriving.

My only companion, a total stranger.

Why did you do it?

Do what?

Emigrate.
Leave Earth.

I'm interviewing you.

You're what?

You're the first hibernation failure
in the history of space travel.

That makes you a story.

Who are you going to tell?
Posterity.

So why did you give up
your life on Earth?

A 120 years space hibernation means you
never see your family or friends again.

You'll wake up in a new century,
on a new planet.

It's the ultimate geographical suicide.

Well, I could ask you the same thing.

But it's my interview.

Were you running away from something?

No.

Everything is okay.
So?

I guess I just wanted a new world.
I don't know, a fresh start.

That's HomeStead Company advertising.

Is it?
Jim.

I... I know.
I guess, you're right.

Back on Earth, when something breaks,
you don't fix it, you replace it.

In the colonies, they have problems to solve.

My kind of problems.

The mechanic is similar.

It's a new world still being built.

I can build a house and live in it.

Open country,
room to grow.

Now you're back to slogans.

Can't slogans be true?

Do you know how much Homestead
Company's made off its first planet?

8 quadrillion dollars.

That's 8 million billions.

Colony planets are the
biggest business now.

Did you pay full price
for your ticket?

No, I'm in a desirable trade.

So they fill your head with dreams,

discount your ticket, and you
fly off to populate their planet

and give HomeStead 20% of everything
you made for the rest of your life.

Not to mention the debt you're
going to owe on this fancy starship.

So all you see here
is 5,000 suckers?

I see zeroes on the
HomeStead Company's bottom line.

I see 5,000 men and women
changing their lives.

5,000 different reasons.
You don't know these people.

I'm a journalist. I know how people.

Really?

This one.

Is he a banker, a teacher or a gardener?

Banker.
He's a gardener.

And her, is she a
Maddison, Donna or Lola?

Donna's too serious for that hair.

Lola.

Maddison.
Shit.

Alright.

Chef, accountant or midwife?

She has to be a midwife.
There's no way you just made that one up.

She is a midwife.

Good to know
they still have midwives.

I liked her.
We would be friends.

You think you can see that?

Don't you?

I do.

A round trip ticket.

That's right.
I was going to fly to Homestead II,

live for a year and
right back to Earth.

I don't get it.
I left Earth for a new life.

But you end up back
where you started.

I end up in the future.
250 years in the future.

On Earth, which is still the
center of civilization, like it or not.

And I would be the only writer that ever
travel to the colony world and come back.

I'll have a story 
no one else can tell.

What story?

Humanity's flight to the stars.

The greatest migration in human history.
It's the biggest story there is.

But you won't know any of the
people who were reading it.

But they'd be reading it.

Well, they would.
But...

I'll never write it now.

I don't know if
I'll ever write again.

Jim, I can't think of anything else to try

...to save us.

And I don't even want to
think about it anymore.

What is there to do around here?

Are you serious?
I'm dead serious.

Partner mode.

Come on, get in harmony.

You just stand here,
and then we repeat what they do.

Is there anything else we can do?

Just do the...
Okay.

You don't have to.
Okay.

Hey.

Here we go.
Let's see if... Oh.

Whoa!
Whoa!

Oh.
Why are you smiling?

I'm up 2 points.

Who's the lovely lady?

This is Aurora.

Aurora.
A pleasure.

You did great!
Okay. One more time.

One more time.
Easy.

<font color="#80ffff">Fantasy Drama</font>

Oh!

YES!
Woo!

Sorry I didn't wear pants for a month.

It's 7 weeks and 2 days,
to be exact.

The man has no shame.

Well, you're a little lack and
you're rather low yourself , Arthur.

I laughed at a man with no pants
until I realised I have no legs.

For a minute, I almost forgot
my life isn't ruined.

I'm sorry.

What for?

I'm going to go to bed.

Good night.
Alright.

Good night, Aurora.

She is wonderful.

Excellent choice.

Hello.

Hi.

Here you go.

Is he asking me on a date?

Do you need a pen?

She didn't seem that impressed.

"Love to."
She wrote "Love to".

You have a visitor.

Wow.

You clean up pretty good yourself.

You went shopping.
I went shop... lifting.

Evening.
What can I get for you?

I'll have a Manhattan, please.

Whiskey rocks.
Coming up.

You two look fine this evening.

Thank you, Arthur.

We're on a date!

Very nice.

Took you long enough to ask.

I was giving you space.

Oh.

Space, the one thing
I do not need any more of.

Thank you very much.

That was so good.

Well, it wasn't easy
getting a reservation.

They probably going to want
us to give up our table.

Getting a lot of dirty looks.
Very popular tonight.

So how's your book coming?

Well, I don't know what it is yet.

My dad, he started to
write about his life, but...

he had stories.
He...

sailed around Antarctica.
He...

was a war reporter.
He... had lovers.

He wrote about his daughter.

And what about you?
No.

I grew up reading
about myself in his books.

How was that?

It's always easy.

A little more than you wanted
to know about yourself.

I mean, when I was 17,
he had a heart attack.

I-I just keep that.

End of story.

Oh, so serious.
I'm sorry.

We need more wine.

I like to hear about your life.

Thanks.

Why are we here?

You'll see.

Best show in town.

So you've done this before?

Oh yeah.

And it's safe?

No.

Reasonably safe.

Hop in.
You're next.

What about my dress?

Right.

Turn around.

Tail attached.

What are you doing?

Do you trust me?

Thank you.

You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

You kill me.

You okay?

Yeah.

I am fine.

It's just...

Yeah, I know.

So, I'm seeing someone.

You'll never guess who.

We're the last 2 people in the world
do whatever to get together.

But here we are.

The last 2 people in the world.

What did you say?

I'm writing, Arthur, hush.

Jim and I live in
an accidental happiness.

Like castaways making their home
on strange shores.

"strange shores".
I love it.

You do?
You don't have to say that.

I know.
You're not going to eat this?

Something fishy to you?

Keep reading.

It's funny.

We all have dreams.

We planned our futures and
we're the captains of our fates.

But we are passengers.

We go where fate takes us.

Arthur!

This isn't the life we â€‹â€‹planned.

But it's ours.

And for the first time in my life,

I don't feel alone.

We weren't suppose
to find each other,

but we did.

It makes me feel like
my life isn't over.

Like it's just beginning.

How was your day?

Good, I wrote a few pages.

Did you find anything
that can help us?

I did.
Are they real?

I cut them myself.

You know for 2 unlucky people,
we sure felt pretty lucky.

Attention.

You may wish to proceed
to a Viewing Area.

The Avalon will slingshot
around the star Arcturus.

That was amazing.

We were a child.

The universe is a present to you.

What?

Happy birthday.

Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you...

Happy birthday, dear Aurora...

Happy birthday to you.

Birthday drink for the birthday girl.

Aren't you going to ask for my I.D.?
I might not be old enough to drink.

Oh, I'd never ask your age
in front of a gentleman.

Jim is no gentleman.

Anyway there's no secrets
between me and Jim.

Is that so?

You heard the lady.
I will be right back.

This is a perfect birthday drink,
thank you.

I remember this day, a year ago.

Jim was so looking forward
to meeting you.

What?

How could he be
looking forward to it?

Oh, he spent months deciding
whether to wake you up.

He couldn't stop talking about you.

Jim woke me up.

Oh, yes.

He said it was the
hardest decision of his life,

but I see it
worked out just fine.

What?

Did you wake me up?

Yes.
I woke you up.

How...

How could you do it?

I tried not to.

I'm going to be sick.

I can't see!

Aurora, please.

Stay away from me!

.

.

Can I talk to you?

Aurora.

I know nothing I can say
will make this okay.

But please listen.

I was so alone

for so long.

I felt like I was disappearing.

The night I first saw you,
I was ready to...

You saved my life.

And I know there's no excuse
for what I did.

I read everything you wrote.

And I fell in love
with your voice

and with the way
your mind works.

I fell in love with you.

And all of a sudden,

it's like I wasn't trapped anymore.

My pointless life suddenly had meaning.

And I wish I could take it back.

But I can't.

Aurora, I don't want to lose you.

I DON'T CARE !!!

I don't care what you want!

I don't care
why you woke me up!

You took my life!

Please standby.

Your suite's control center is rebooting.

CRITICAL ERROR

I envy you, Arthur.

How so?

You have a purpose.

You're always happy.

How's your book coming along?

I've never written about me before.

I think it's some of the
best work I've ever done,

and I don't even know
why I'm doing it.

There's only one person who could read it
and I can't stand him.

They say time heals all wounds.

Broken hearts aren't that simple.

You wouldn't understand.

Arthur!

Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

It's Wednesday.

The bar is all yours.

What will you have?
Whiskey?

Coffee.

Aurora, we love you!
Aurora, we love you!

What are we going
to do without you?

The bravest woman I know.

Hi, Aurora!
Hi, Aurora!

I promise that
I'll think of you every day.

When you wake up
I'll be gone,

but just know that
I'll never forget you.

You're my best friend.

You were never happy here,
I know.

Nothing was ever enough for you.

You know, you don't have to go.
You could-

You could do whatever it is
you have to do right here.

Whatever.

Since you're going,
here's my wish.

I hope you finally find someone
who fills your heart. And...

I hope you let him in.

I hope you'd realize you don't have
to do something amazing to be happy.

Go.

Have fun.

Take chances.

Um, okay.

I love you, Aurora.

Bye.

Morning, Arthur!

Coffee please.

Coming up.

Are you soiling my bar stool?

You want to make things,
you got to get your hands dirty.

And what have you been making?
Improvements.

Grand Concourse.

First floor.

Gold-class breakfast.

Huh!

This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.

Who the hell planted
a tree on my ship?

Who did that?
I did.

Who are you?

Jim Preston.

Aurora Lane.

Anybody else awake?

Just me and him.

How far along are we?

88 years to go.

Hibernation failure.

They said that couldn't happen.

But 3 people,
3 pod failures.

You have no idea how long
I've been trying to get in here.

Now that you're in.
Don't touch anything.

This is where you work?

No, this is flight crew,
I'm a Deck Chief.

Navigation comp.

Unauthorized personnel.

Sorry.

If I'm reading this right,
we're still on course.

So whatever's wrong with the ship,
NavComp's still on the job.

There's something wrong with the ship?

3 pod failures?
Yeah.

There's something wrong.
Question is what.

That's strange.

I should be getting diagnostics
from all over the ship right here,

but there's no data.

We gave to check
all the systems manually.

Can't we turn the ship around?
Go back to Earth?

We're doing 50% of lightspeed.

Turning back would take just
as much time as going on.

Well, there's got to be
something we can do!

Sorry, we're going where we're going.

You okay?

Hibernation hangover.

Get it all the time.

Grand Concourse.

2 years, huh?
Any more trees I need to know about?

LOOK OUT!

I've never seen this happen before.

Those robots have been breaking down.

This guy makes 15?

15.

The breakfast spun crazy today.

And the elevator.

Last week my door broke.
I was trapped in my cabin for 2 days.

You were?

Things like that don't happen.
Not on this ship.

There are 60 of these
tech-stations on every deck.

Dock this way.

Data stays on the map.
You got it?

Mm.
Yeah.

You take decks 1 and 2.
You take decks 3 and 4.

I'm going down to the Hibernation Bay,
to check our pods.

Now that should be interesting.

Aren't you supposed to be making rounds.

I finished.

I checked your pod.

The problem's very simple.
The clock chips burned out.

It ain't supposed to happen,
but pretty simple.

My pod was more complicated.

A bunch of system failures,
it all happened at the same time,

the whole damn thing went haywire.

Which explains why I'm feeling so bad.

But Aurora's pod...

You did this.

Yeah.

All this time, I was thinking you're
one lucky son of a bitch

to get stuck with Aurora.

It wasn't luck, was it?

No.

She knows?

She knows.

How long were you alone?

A year.

Still...

Damn.

Same as the rest.

Systems shut downs.

Everywhere, but no apparent connection.

You saw the hibernation pods?

I saw.

So you know.

What Jim did.

Yeah.

And?

It's not my duty...
He woke me up!

He took away my life!
I know and I'm sorry.

There's work I have to...
It's murder!

You're right, Aurora.

But the drowning man always
try to drag someone down with him.

It ain't right,
but the man is drowning.

This one make 16.

Yeah.

You okay?

You should go rest.
Yeah.

But just for a couple of hours and then,
back here first thing in the morning.

<font color="#ff8080">GRAVITY LOSS</font>

<font color="#ff8080">GRAVITY DRIVE</font>

<font color="#80ffff">GRAVITY DRIVE</font>

I was in the pool
when gravity gave out.

Are you okay?

We need to find Gus.

Gus!
Gus!

Gravity loss means that whatever is wrong
we're start to hit the big ticket items.

Not good.

Every failure is a burnout process,
every thing on board is thinking too hard.

Why?

Computer, display these failures over time.

Processing timeline.

Cascades.

It started 2 years ago,
power surge.

17 failures on 1 day.

Including hibernation pod 1498.

That's me.

Woke me up.

What happened that day?
Something big.

A major system went down somewhere.

Everything else on board
is trying to pick up the load

but the load's too heavy.

Whatever started this
we got to find it.

And fix it.
How bad can this get?

Give me a risk analysis
based on this data.

Extrapolating.

Emission critical failure is imminent.

Failing systems:
Life support. Fusion reactor.

So we're stranded...

Ion drive.

on a sinking ship.

Main Engineering.

Not a lot of things big enough
to hit this ship that hard.

With diagnostics out,
we'll have to find it ourselves.

Where do we start?

Gus!

Scan complete.
Analyzing data.

612 DISORDERS FOUND

What does it say
is wrong with me?

It's a few things.

612 disorders found.

Get me out of here.

What's the prognosis?

Critical diagnosis cannot be discussed
without a doctor or a dentist.

Override on my authority,
I.D. 2317.

Lay it on me, doc.

Pan-systemic necrosis.

Progressive organ failure.
Cause unknown.

My goofy hibernation pod,
that's the cause.

What's the treatment?
Various treatment impossible.

None will unmeaningly
extend the patient's life.

How long have I got?

Your end of life transition
is already under way.

These sedatives will alleviate
your suffering during these final hours.

Gus?

I need a minute.

We are experiencing difficulties in flight.

Gus!
Gus!

Where can he be?

For your own safety,
please return to your cabins.

For your own safety,
please return to your cabins.

Shit, the damn pills.

I'll go get them.
No, stay.

Sit down.

You two take care of each other.

My I.D..

Get you where you need to go.

Fix the ship.

Find out what's wrong with her.

How do I look?

You look magnificent.

Ladies love a dressed man.

What do we do now?

This can't be good.

I'm going back to Engineering.

Can you fix this?

I need your help.

Let's go!

Arthur!

Let's go!

Main Engineering.

Can't we wake up
some of the crew?

They would take too long to recover,
we don't have that kind of time.

What are we even looking for?

Something broken.

Something big.

Come on!

Is it broken?
It seems okay.

What next?

Power Plant.
This way.

Come on.

Whole section's closed down.
Something's wrong.

We're looking for wrong.

Try to open it.

Warning.

Pressure door.
Lock down initiated.

Please secure all doors.

Aurora!

Warning.
Dangerous oxygen level.

Please secure all doors.

Dangerous oxygen level.
Please secured all doors.

Grab it!

Pressurizing cabin on sensor door.

Pressure normalized.

Oxygen level restored.

Stand lock down.

A hole in the ship.

More than one.

How did that even happen?
This ship is supposed to be meteor-proof.

I guess one got through.

It's hot!

I think we found it.

It's the reactor control computer.

This is what hit us 2 years ago.

Jim.

How can we fix this?

We're going to die.

There's replacement parts for everything.

Light.

Sorry.

As soon as I pull this module,
the entire computer is going to shut down.

What happens then?

I'll get it back up
as quickly as I can.

Hurry!

Jim!

Control computer restored.

Venting reactor.

But we fixed it!

Reactor vent failed. 
Manual override required.

Vent failure.

Come on!
Jim.

Outer door non-responsive.

What does that mean?

The outer door is jammed.

We got to open that door
and cool the reactor down

or the whole ship's going to blow.

How?

I got to go out there.

Open it from the outside.

I open the door
I get cleared.

You blow that fire into space.

You get cleared? 
You talk to me through this.

What happens to you
when that door opens?

Heat shield. 
It might help.

You might need this.

It's going to be okay.

I'm gonna go.

Jim.

Jim.

Come back to me.

I can't live on the ship 
without you.

Warning.
Temperature critical.

AHHHH!

What's wrong?

What's the matter?
Are you okay?

Nothing.
Go.

You sure?

Yeah.

I'm in the vent tube.

New anchor port. 
Reset tail.

I see the door.

Temperature level rising.

Warning.
Temperature critical.

Containment unstable.

Where are you?

I'm at the door.

I'm ready, just say when.

There goes.

The door won't open. 
I'll have to bypass it.

Temperature level rising.

Jim, come on!

Please, hurry!

Okay, I'm trying it again. 
Tell me when you're cleared.

No!

What?

What's going on?

Jim?

Jim!

The door won't stay open.

I think I have to stay here, 
hold the door open.

No!

No way, get out of there!

I can't.

Jim...

We're out of time.

Containment unstable.

Jim?

Vent the reactor.

No, you don't understand!

If I open the right now
it will kill you!

I'm opening it up.

Come back in, 
we'll think of something else.

There is nothing else.

Jim!

It's okay. 
No, it's not okay!

Aurora
Warning. Temperature critical.

This is not how it's suppose to happen!

Aurora, this ship is going to go.

I don't care!
You die, I die.

There are 5,000 other people 
on this ship, Aurora.

We have to do this.

Maximum pressure reached.

Do it. 
Now.

Maximum cabin pressure reached.

Temperature dropping.

Jim.

Jim.
Vent successful.

Rebooting process initiated.

Jim, please say something.

Suit pressure dropping.

Return to ship immediately.

Aurora.

It worked!

You did it, you can come in!

Yeah, about that...

What's the matter?
Are you hurt?

I got blown out of the tube.

What?

My tail broke.
I can't get back to the ship.

I'll come out. I'll come out.
I'll pull you in.

Warning.
Oxygen level critical.

Return to ship immediately.

Aurora, I'm sorry...

... for everything.

Shut up, I'm coming.

I wish we'd have met 
in 90 years.

I...
I'd build you a house.

I'll read your book.

It's a good feel.

Tail attached.

Locate Jim Preston.

Jim Preston, located.

I'm going to get you.

JIM!

I'm sorry. 
The patient is dead.

WELL, RESUSCITATE HIM!

Postmortem operations require 
authorized medical supervision.

No!

OVERRIDE!

DO IT, NOW!

Executing

Jim.

Jim.

You brought me back.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Be still.

Of course.

There's something I have to show you.

In Command mode, it turns out 
the autodoc has a option

called "Stabilize and Suspend".

It stops all metabolic activity.

What are you saying?

It's â€‹â€‹Gus' idea. 
It could be like hibernation.

Inside the autodoc,
you can go back to sleep.

But there's only one autodoc.

Yeah.

And you're going to 
lay down in it,

and fall asleep.

And you'll wake up on Homestead II,

and you'll write you book.

You finish your journey.
You do what you set out to do.

You'll be alone.

I've been alone before
and I'll be fine.

But I'll never see you again.

I'll come and visit you.

Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

Lovely as ever.

Thank you, Arthur. 
You're looking very well yourself.

Thanks to you.

What's that?

Something I wanted to 
give you for a long time.

It's beautiful.

Took you long enough to ask.

Champagne. 
I'll wait.

Hell of a life.

Hell of a life.

HOMESTEAD II

HOMESTEAD II
88 YEARS LATER

Crew wake up process initiated.

My fellow passengers,

if you are reading this, then the 
starship Avalon has reached its destination.

Grand Concourse.

A lot happened while you slept.

A friend once said,

"You can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

that you forget to make
the most of where you are.

We got lost on our way.

We found each other.

And we made a life.

A beautiful life... together.
