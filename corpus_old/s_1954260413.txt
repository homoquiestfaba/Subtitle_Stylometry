Yes, it is fact. I've been living my
whole life in this area, honest!

It's strange, I'm
came out here before.

I would like to Paris.

I've been out there.

Really?

They had determined
a lovely time.

Drink champagne, yes.

Thanks again for coming
to my side of town.

It's my pleasure.

I know I told you I hadn't had
much luck with these internet dates.

After our phone conversation, I thought

meeting in person
would be a good idea.

A very good idea.

Usually people lie about what
they look like, but you didn't.

Neither did you.

Mind if I excuse
myself for a moment?

We shouldn't ...

Sorry, I got to cut
things short, but I ...

I ... I got to go.

What do you mean?

It was really nice to meet you.

Can't stay and
talk for a while, huh?

I really have to go.

This is Jessica, leave a message.

Hey, it's me. Call me.  I like
this one. We need to talk.

<i>Searchers found the body

<i>The investigation is ongoing.</i>

I thought our date
was going so well.

We should continue,
don't you think?

Where are you taking me?

Some place nice.
I think you'll like it.

Here we are.

Ha, ha, where are you going?

Are you going to kill me?

What?  What kind of
person do you think I am?

I thought you'd like
to see some of my work.

I ... pulled that
one from the river.

The woman's body had
been submerged for weeks.

It is said that her husband
tried to bury her in the mud.

How awful that
must have been for him.

Hey, ever seen what
water does to a body?

No! No! No!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Do not make me
do it again, okay?

Okay.

Alright now!  Okay, listen!

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

I think you'll
really going to like it.

No!

I'll be right back.

I'll give you anything you want!
Just let me go!

Anything?
You don't even know me!

I don't even know
your favourite colour!

Hey! Don't blow the
moment for both of us, okay?

I like green.

Here we go, come on.

Stupid, I don't think ... stupid!

Hell ... Hello?

Where you think you're going, huh?

Help!

Help! Please!

Oh shit!

Fucking door!

Julia!

Stop it!

Here you go!

I've really been
enjoying our time together.

Want some tea?

I know you'd prefer coffee,
but I don't have that.

I have a confession to make.

At least we don't have girls here.

That really makes you vulnerable,
sharing spaces, you know?

How can you trust these days?

One minute you're having coffee

and in the next minute
your heart is broken.

I shouldn't be so insensitive.

It's a little late for that now.

You are right.

My manners are not
what they used to be.

But it's stupid cunts like
you that make me like this.

That was uncalled for.

Fuck you!

You're not running the show,
yeah, you're not that special.

You actually have a fucked up,
excuse me, screwed up smile!

You've got that one,
teeth like that, not straight.

You'd better
just fix some of it now.

I've had prettier dates than you.

This is my show,
I'm running this!

Told you that?

Coward!

What?

If you're going to kill me,
just go ahead an do it.

We're having such a good time.

You want to leave.  I know ...

What?

Escape.  You're mapping a way out.

I'd be careful.  It's a
dangerous road out there.

Julia!

Julia, there's no place to go!

Julia!

Come out, come out!
Wherever you are.

Julia!  You are a bad, bad girl!

Fuck you!

Funny girl!

What took you so long?
I started to get worried.

I'm fine.

You don't look fine.

He just caught me off
guard a little, that's all.

I wasn't expecting
it to go this far.

Jules, are you sure
what we are doing?

Enough, Jessica.
I've got it under control.

Just help me
put him in the trunk.

Are you ready?

Yeah!

How you really pissed him off.

Just help me get
him out of the trunk.

I'm not sure
about this thing, Jules.

What are you not sure about?

You don't fucking move unless
I tell you to!   You got it?

It looks like we got
a real nasty one, Jules!

He's a real peach, alright!

What happened?
Hey!

Help me get this
piece of shit inside.

He's heavy!

Oh! Fuck!

Jessie, I'm sorry.
Fine.  Just get him inside.

Sleep tight!

Just get it over with.

Oh my God!

Found our next guy.

What?

After we get rid of this one, I get
someone new to take his place.

Got him in a chat room.

You know, we don't do that.

He sent me a picture of his dick.

So?  It always happens.

Yeah, but you didn't see it
though.  It was so wrinkled

and he was wearing a dress.

That's disgusting.

Here.

Watch it!

I was just trying to help.

You can't go after every guy,

who says something sexual
to you in a chat room,

or sends you a
picture of his penis.

I thought we were
going get rid of their kinds.

Get up!

I said, get up!

I'm going to
fuck you up, man!

I'm looking forward to it.

Oh!  Fuck!

Hey asshole, looking for something?

How about a hammer?

I thought you wanted to play?

Who's your little friend?

Did you kill him?
No.

Why not?

Because he doesn't
deserves a quick death.

Okay, fine, but then
I want to kill him.

You're not killing him.

I have just as much
right to this, as you do.

This is such a bull shit.
Deal with it.

Jessica!

Fuck you!

Good, you're awake!

Hell of a situation you
got yourself into here.

I wonder what you thought
you were going to do with me.

You're fucking stupid!

I didn't catch that.

Maybe you were going to
break me, huh?  Torture me.

Me me your trophy?

Is this the best shit
you can come up with?

You are all the same.

Just because a
woman smiles at you

or says hello, doesn't mean
she wants to fuck you!

You don't own her
and you don't own me!

Interesting music choice.

Oh, I like it.

When I say I'm going
to fuck you up, I mean it!

Watch him for a minute.

I know you want to touch me.

You want to have me, don't you?

Now, you are thinking very
dirty thoughts about me!

Do you wanna taste me?

Do you wanna fuck me?

But you won't kill me.

What are you doing?

That's my bra!

Yeah, well, it looks better on me!

Stop being so childish!

Cover yourself up!

What?  Do my tits bother you?

Please let her continue.

What the fuck was that about?
I'm talking to you.

Why can't we just
get rid of him already?

Soon, okay?

When do I get to
be the bait for once?

You know how
I feel about that.

I can take care of myself.

I made a promise to
myself a long time ago,

that I would never let
anybody hurt you again.

You can't always be
there to take care of me.

You have to trust I
can take care of myself.

It's not about trust,
you're my baby sister.

You have to stop
treating me like I'm a baby.

I'm tired of it.
Stop worrying about me.

I can't.  Look, I don't want
to fight right now, Jessie.

Too tired.

Hello.

How can I help you?

I live  in the house
across the street.

Yeah, I've seen you before.

I think, maybe, you could
help me out with something.

What were you looking for?

It's my bike,
I'm having trouble with it.

I thought maybe you
could take a look at it.

Yeah, a bike?

That, I  mean,
if you're not too busy.

Yeah, I think I could
spare a few minutes.

What seems to be the problem?

Some days I just
can't even get it started.

And I, crank it and crank
it, and it just sits there.

Maybe I'm doing it wrong.

I think you are doing just fine.

It sounds like the gasoline is turning
into varnish inside the carburetor.

Boring stuff, but

isn't a problem.

That's really sweet of you
to help me out like this.

Maybe there's
something I can do for you?

What do you have in mind?

Maybe we could play a game.

Yeah?

Do you like games?

I do now.

Come here.

Turn around.

What's going on?

Just playing.
Don't you trust me?

I don't even know your name.

What do you want it to be?

Wow!  You playing like that, huh?

Rose.  Always liked that name.

Whatever you say.

So listen.  You be a good boy.

Rose has some surprises.

Yeah?

Let the games begin!

Just a little bit further.

Okay, oh.

Okay.

Okay.

Hold still.

I've never done this before.

Sure you'll be great at it.

Now you stay right here,
Rose is gonna be right back.

I'll be waiting.

Obviously.

Strange girl.
Oh Shit!

What the fuck man?
Who's there?

What's your name?

Sam, what's yours?

You going to have sex with her?

What?  What's going on here, huh?

Well, Sam.  We're tied up.

We're sitting in the kitchen
of a sexually active girl.

So, what do you
think is going on here?

Look man.  I'm not
into this kinky shit, huh.

I was just trying to
help a girl fix her bike.

You wanted to give her engine
a little crank then, huh?

Yeah, something like that.

I wonder what they
gonna do with you.

They?

There's more than one girl, Sam.
And they have a lot of energy.

Okay, well, you sound like
you know what's going on.

What ... what are
they gonna do, huh?

What are they gonna do, man?

Well, if you're lucky, maybe
they'll have their way with you.

They would have
shown me a good time.

You had sex with both of them?

Oh, Sam, I've done things with these
girls that you won't even believe.

Okay, okay, it's ...
I just, you know, I've ...

I've never been with two girls.

Well then maybe,
this is your lucky day.

Jessica?

Still worth listening?

Yeah, are you gonna be joining us?

I don't know.
Is that something you want?

What?  No, no, God,
no!  I  just ... no!  It's ...

No offense, but I ...
you know I don't do guys.

Well, it doesn't sound
like you doing anybody.

I do fine, thank you very much.

You see all these women that you've
been with, they wanna choke them.

Like, during sex?

Whenever ..

Wait, is that what they
want me to fucking do here?

Some girls are into
that sort of thing.

Look man, I don't know
what kind of girls you date

but this is some weird ass shit.

Depends on your point of view.

Jessica.

What are you doing?

I'm really sleepy, I
want to go to bed now.

Why are you dressed like that?

Answer me!
Why are you dressed like that?

Rose!  Hey, Rose!  Listen.

I don't know what you
have in mind here, but

this is starting to
freak me out, okay?

I am not into this kind of shit, just

... if you could just
let me go, I swear to ...

Who the fuck is this?

I don't know,
I didn't get his name.

It's Sam.

Shut the fuck up, I wasn't talking
to you.  What is he doing here?

Apparently, he's here
to fix her motorcycle.

Speak again and I will staple
your fucking mouth shut!

Get in the hallway.
Get in the fucking hallway!

Who the fuck is that, man?

That was the other girl.

Look at you.  Fucking stupid.
Who is this guy?

I do not know.  I found him in
the garage across the street.

You brought a local here?
Are you completely fucking insane?

It's so fucked!

You headed somewhere?

Did anybody see you?

I don't know.

Damn it Jessica, what were
you planning on doing with him?

Killing him.

How did you end up here?

I am on a date with Rose's sister.

This is a date?

Yeah, so far it's been
a pretty decent good one.

You gotta bring him back.

I'm not doing that.

Yes, you are!

Stop telling me what to do.

Okay, I can make my own decisions!

I don't know who's crazier.
The people that are doing this to us,

or the people who fell for it.

I like you, Sam.  You're smart.

Too bad.

What?   No, why did
you say, "too bad"?

Hey?

What does that mean, too bad?

You meant something by that!
What does that mean?

You know something,
I know you know something!

You know something, tell me!

Are you mad that I
brought home my own kill,

or you're just jealous because
I did it without any of your help?

Oh, you can't be serious.
Grow up!

I'm trying to,
but you won't let me.

Oh God, stop!  What are you
going to do?  What's going on?

Hey, what's going on?  Please, please,
whatever you're going to do, don't do it!

Here, you want blood so bad.
You got it.  Here you go.

No! No. No, no, no, no.
No blood!

No blood, no blood, please!

Please, no blood!
What is going ...?

What's going on?
What are you doing?

I'm killing.  You shut up.

No, no, no, please, Rose!
I beg you.

My name is not Rose!

That's a fat chicks name!

What's so funny?

You don't got the guts.

Well, maybe I should
just start with you then?

Holy shit!

Oh! You fucking bitch,
I'm going to kill you!

Fucking kill you.

Okay.  Fucking kill you!
Okay, you can stop now.

Just let go of me!
Don't proof anything to me!

Can't you see I'm working here?

Jessica, enough.

Get out of my way!

I don't even know
who you are anymore.

Yeah, you too.
I'm just like you.

Look, you let me take care of them.
You go relax.

Look alive, Sam.

Leave him alone!

Yeah, leave me alone!

Help! Help!

Shut up!
If you scream again,

I will fucking cut your tongue out!

Why are you doing?
What did I ever do to you?

No, no, no, no.
I ask the questions!

Just kill the poor kid, already!

Fuck you, man!

Oh, no, no.
No, that won't be fun. No.

No, we want to take
our time, don't we, Sam?

My sister may be done
playing with you, but I'm not!

Can't breathe.

Hey, man, you okay?
Are you fucking alive?

Are you even alive?

Oh, thank God!

Okay, listen, man.  Listen.
I can't move.

So maybe you can make
your way over to me.  Okay.

Just ... just stroot over to me,
and you can get me undone,

and then I'll fucking
get you undone, man.

Come on, come on!  Just stroot
over to me, just stroot over!

What?

Come on.

I don't want anything to
do with this.  Just let me go!

Yeah, yeah, here come on!

What is that?

Hey man, are you free?

Hey, what are you doing?

Holy shit, you're free., man.
You are free!  Come on!

Okay, okay.
Now let me go!

Let me go, man!  Come on.
They're gonna come back!

Look, I'll just fucking
walk out, okay.

I swear to God, I'll just walk out.

I'll let you get back to your date,

or whatever the
shit you're doing here.

Just ... just untie me!  Come on,
please and just fucking let me go!

Man, I swear to God,
I'll just walk out of here

won't ask any questions!

Come on, man!
What is that?

What is that?
What are you doing?

Come on, man, come on, please.

I swear to God, please.

Please!  Just untie me, man.
Untie me!

You can have both of them, man.
Come on, just let me go!

What is that?

What is that?

What's going on?
Just let me go, man!

Just ... just let me go!

Yeah?

Please!

Oh my God!

Take care, Sam!

How the hell did he get free?

How should I know?

You were the last one with him.

Where is your friend?

I do not know!

What's this?

Wire cutters.

Yeah, I know what they are.
How the fuck did he get them?

My sister asked you a question!

I don't fucking know.
He just walked out.

I'm going to have to rip out that
fucking, lying tongue of yours!

I don't give a fuck about him!
We need to find our friend.

Fine.  I'll cut it out later.
Lucky Sammy!

I don't know how
this could have happened.

Well, it obviously did,
so we'll just find him, okay?

He's probably half
way down the block.

Oh, he didn't leave.

How do you know?

Because I do.

You think this is
my fault, don't you?

What?

You don't believe me,
you never believed me!

Be quiet!  I believe you!

Do you see him?
I told you he left.

No, he wants to stay for the
same reason we want him here.

Well.

Want to come play in my room?
Will be more fun, don't you think?

Oh, oh, please, don't kill me!

Just leave.

You like that, you fucker?

Oh, God it's so good!

It takes treat all your needs?
Only the ones that get laid!

Oh, what are we now?  But you
don't even know anything about me!

Where do I begin?

I bet you didn't know
my favorite color was pink!

Let's just keep
this physical, okay!

It is rude to interrupt a girl
when she has a window to do!

I've stopped listening to
bitches like you a long time ago!

Excuse me, I wasn't
done talking yet!

So pink is your
favourite colour, huh?

I always pegged
you for a yellow girl.

Shut up.

You're not the first
asshole I have killed.

I'm not dead yet!

I want to be rescued by "Mr.Right"!

I want the bad stuff to
go away and get fixed!

I want someone who gets me!

I want to sing in the rain

and be with someone who does too.

I just want my soul-mate.

I just want someone to
tell me that I'm beautiful,

inside or out.

You know what, though?

You really are pretty.
And I love Mexican food.

You no one will ever get you.

But only me!

You're not my first
either, but you're my ...

I'm sorry.  Did that hurt?

Shall we continue?

I love "The Sound of Music",
but hated "Mary Poppins"!

Andrews was such a
brat in that movie!

Julie Andrews is a
national fucking treasure?

Is that all you've got?

Oh, I thought you were
going to fuck me up?

Ah, I never wanted to fuck you up,

I just want to fucking kill you.

Just playing with you, old man.

Date's over.

How could you?

Come here, come here!

Oh God! Oh God!

You won't listen!
Now be silent!

I told you, you
gotta listen!

Why don't you listen?
Shut up!

Come on, come on!
Shut up!

A little help here, Jess!

Jessie!

Jess.

Why?

It's my turn.

The best date I ever had.

Goodbye.

For you.

Thanks for coming here.

Thank you.

I haven't had much luck
with these internet dates.

It just seems like
everybody's out to fuck me.

Or maybe I'm just being paranoid.

I know what you mean.
So tell me about yourself.

There's not really much to say.

Julia Y.   So, what
does the "Y" stand for?

Oh, that's for me to know,
and for you to find out.

Well, I look
forward to finding out.

You want to fuck with Daddy?

Ah, you like it
rough, don't you?

Yeah, you like it, don't you?

Yes, he does like that shit, too, Babe!
Give it up for him!

Get over there, bitch!

Ah, that's what you want,
eh you slut?   Ain't it, slut!

You want that chocolate
stick, don't you, huh?

Huh you little slut, huh?
You like that don't you?

Inside your ass, pussy ...

Yeah, alright!

Excuse you.
