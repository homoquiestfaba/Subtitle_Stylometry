FORTUNE TELLER: Your zodiac sign is ox.

Stubborn, but also industrious

and hard-working.

Fate has promised you a reward
for your efforts.

Hmm. You have experienced a recent loss.

Someone close to you has died.

Leaving your year pillar "empty."

You are without shade in your old age.

Hmm. Fate has cheated you.

Xin.

Huh.

I see the element "xin" in your destiny.

Signifying momentous change.

This coincides with
your ten-year-luck pillar.

(DISHES CLINK)

I like my apartment.

But it just makes sense.

We wouldn't have to pay for both places.

(IN MANDARIN) I'll pay it myself.

MAN: (IN ENGLISH) How?

(IN MANDARIN) With what?
Your retirement money?


(IN ENGLISH) Plus...

I think, maybe you shouldn't
be living by yourself.

Look what happened
when you hurt your ankle.

No one was there.

What if next time it's more serious?

(IN MANDARIN) I'm in perfect health.

Doctor Chen just says

She doesn't pee as much as she used to.

(IN ENGLISH) You know,
most people your age

Look, Little Handsome.

How green and smooth these leaves are!

She must use chicken bones
or something.

Egg shells?
(SPRAYING)

We should take one for the boss.

He'll love it.

Shhh! Look, she's here.

Grandma Wong!

(DOOR CLOSES)

Doing a little shopping?

Big night at the slots?
(SPRAYING)

I like craps myself.

Always feels like a party
when you're winning.

(MACHINE WHIRRING)

What?

The ride from the casino is what?

3 hours?

LITTLE HANDSOME: More or less.

What, what, what...

...are you guys doing
at my home?!

MAN: And you?

What do you like?

Slots?

Blackjack?

Oh, allow me.

(LIGHTER CLICKS)

Do you know who else liked the slots?

Mr. Lin!

Old Peng said you sat
next to him last night.

He's Fukienese.

About...

this tall.

I was asleep.

MAN: Sure, sure.

You know, poor Mr. Lin on the bus

had a heart attack. Ah!

Did you realize you were
sitting next to a dead man?

I already told you I was asleep!

Asleep!

Eh?

You don't seem very surprised though,

Grandma Wong.

When you're my age,
not much shocks you.

MAN: Sure, sure...

You didn't happen to notice
if Mr. Lin had anything with him?

A bag or a briefcase?

My eyes aren't so good.


Mind if I look at what you got?

I do mind!

(WHIRRING STOPS)


I know your aunt, you know?!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

You're not going to tell
Auntie Chang, are you?

Little Handsome here wouldn't like that.

And when he doesn't like something,

he can hurt himself.
(KNIFE CLICKS)

You see, Little Handsome
doesn't feel pain.


But other people aren't so lucky.
(SPITS)

(BOTH LAUGHING)

If you don't mind,

we'd like to take a look
at your package there...

(PLASTIC CRINKLES)

(IN ENGLISH) Fancy.
Huh.

(IN MANDARIN) Very nice!

And very expensive!

I got a discount!

No disrespect from the Red Dragon.

We're sorry if Mr. Lin's death
caused you any distress.

To have someone die right next to you...


Such bad luck!

Let's go.

See you next time.

(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

Prada, CK, YSL.

Very cheap and nice.

Prada, CK, YSL, Coach.

(IN MANDARIN) I'd like to buy a bag.

Coach? Would you like a Coach bag?

I want LV.

Are you sure you don't want Prada?

Or a DKNY? We have many kinds.

I want a limited edition LV.

We don't have LV.

I know you have it.

You sure you don't want something else?


Okay, okay.
If you are sure, follow me.

Almost there.

MAN: Hurry up!

Go forward!

Blow up his head!

(GUNS FIRING ON VIDEO GAMES)

Boss, this old lady
wants to chat with you.

(VIDEO GAME EXPLOSION)

How can I help you, Grandma?

You're Lao Shei?

I am.

Um...

I heard you offer protection services?

(MEN CHUCKLING)

Many of the local businesses
use our services...


I'd like to hire a bodyguard.

(MEN LAUGHING)

(STOPS LAUGHING)

Sorry Grandma. Excuse us.

But we don't provide services
for individuals.

We're here for the community
at large, you see.

The Red Dragon is bothering me.

May I ask...

Why would the Red Dragon bother

an elderly woman like yourself?

How would I know?

They showed up at my house.

Started to follow me around.

It's very frightening.

Well, if you want to give us business...

How much?

$8000. I can find you someone.

$8000?

$8000 for a weak, elderly woman like me?

Is that reasonable?

High risk, Grandma.
The Red Dragon is no joke.

They are no match for you
Zhongliang Gang though.

It's a piece of cake for you, right?

That's true.

$5000.

I...

I'll sacrifice my health
and cut back on medicine.

I'll sacrifice my health
and cut back on medicine.


Grandma,

if you're not feeling well,
perhaps you shouldn't smoke...


All right!

$5000. That's as low as I can go.

$5000...

Then I want that guy!


Alan is one of our best men!

You're selling me inferior service?!

That's not what I meant.

Then $2000.

We just said $5000.

$5000 is for him!

Discount bodyguard, discount rate.

(TV PLAYING)


When were you born?

1987.

87...

The year of the rabbit.

Weak.

Cautious.
(CHOPPING CONTINUES)

(KNIFE CLINKS)

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

(IN ENGLISH) Hi.

(CUTLERY CLATTERING)

(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

When I tell you to stay home,
you stay home.

(IN ENGLISH) Why?

(IN ENGLISH)
No answer back. Huh?

You're like your father.

(IN MANDARIN) You don't listen!

But I liked your cooking.
(CHUCKLES)

(IN MANDARIN) Eat, eat, eat...

What is it?

(IN ENGLISH) What about him?

(IN MANDARIN) Big Pong?
Don't mind him.

I am a little hungry.

Wide awake, aren't you?
Now that there's food.

Okay, come, come.

Bring the chair.


Thank you.

(IN ENGLISH) Want some chicken?

(IN ENGLISH) Thanks.

I don't eat chicken.
I'm vegetarian.

DAVID: Grandma's chicken's really good.

(IN MANDARIN) My grandmother

used to make drunken chicken too.

She didn't put anise in it though.

She said anise overpowered
the flavor of the wine.

That's silly!

Anise brings out the flavor.

Can't believe she doesn't know that.

She used a pinch of allspice instead.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

(IN ENGLISH) Yeah. Who?

GIRL: It's me.
BIG PONG: Who's me?

What the fuck?

Hi, Nomi.

Who the fuck is this, D?

Uh... That's my grandma's friend.

We'll turn it down.

(IN MANDARIN) Who's that?

MAN: I live downstairs.

Your music is too loud.
I can't sleep!

And how many times
do I have to tell you

every time you cook fish,
you stink up the whole building.

Oh okay, we hear you.

And as I have said before,

don't leave the trash outside your door.

Take it outside like everyone else.

Okay, okay. Is that all?

Wow, you are a giant.

You think you scare me
just because you're 8 feet tall?

I'm tired of you not following
the rules like everybody else.

We'll see what the landlord
has to say about this.

You understand, old woman?

(SIGHS)
What are you...?

Oh, and I know that you...

...you don't have a lease...

BIG PONG: You!

You should respect your elders!

If Grandma wants to cook fish,
she will cook fish.

If she needs to take out the trash,
then you do it for her.

Got it? Huh?
MAN: Yes, yes...

Yes, yes...

I'm fine.

You ready?

It's Tuesday.

I get my hair done on Tuesdays.

Okay.

You're gonna have to wait.

Okay.

How's it going?

Hmm?

Where's your new friend?


Why would an old lady like you

be spending so much time with
a member of the Zhongliang?

Are they really that charming?

At least...

they know how to respect elders.

Old bitch...

where is the money?

I don't know what you are talking about.


(LAUGHING)

Don't be stupid!

(GRUNTS)
(LITTLE HANDSOME GROANS)

(ALL GRUNTING)

Get lost!

You think they'll come back?

The Red Dragon are cowards.
I heard they're all impotent.

You know, from the drugs.

But you won't always be with me.

I'll be here.

Sometimes you won't be.

Grandma,

maybe...

you owe them money?

No, not even one cent.

BIG PONG: But -

I told you.

I really don't have business
with the Red Dragon.

Then why are they bothering you?

How should I know?
I think it's strange too.

I have nothing they want.

Agh, they smoke up too much.

It messes with their brain.

Only the dumb ones join the Red Dragon.

Once I pay off my debt,
I'm going back to Hsinchu.

Me and my sister are making a health app.

Eat more, you need your strength.

Well?

FORTUNE TELLER: (IN CANTONESE)
Your year pillar

hasn't changed.

(IN MANDARIN)
Maybe you made a mistake

about the dragon gate.

(IN CANTONESE) That's not possible.

Look at this, all best luck.

(IN MANDARIN) Why do these
messy things keep happening?

(IN CANTONESE) Grandma Wong,

I'm not too sure what to say...

Your luck still looks very strong.

Maybe the feng shui in your house
has been altered?

Ok, let me write you a prescription.

Chrysanthemum leaves and one goldfish.

Don't worry.

Your good luck will come back around.

(IN MANDARIN) Wait for me here.

What?

Are you sure?

I'll be fine.

This is Benny's place.

Nothing dangerous will happen.

But...

Wait for me.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER)

Mrs. Wong! You're looking
younger every day, ageless beauty!

Long time no see.

Yes, Mrs. Wong.
What can I do for you?

Some advice?

Oh.

Please have a seat.

How are you doing?

A few aches and pains.

(IN ENGLISH) Sorry.

(IN MANDARIN) Still not feeling well?

Last week,

when I was on the bus,

there was a man sitting next to me.

And he suddenly died.
(GASPS)

That really frightened me!

You were on the same bus with Mr. Lin?

So you heard?

A terrible thing.

His heart attack happened so suddenly.

What do you know about him?

He was Zhongliang.

Though there were rumors
he played both sides -

but he worked directly
for the Snakehead, actually.

I thought he was part of Red Dragon.

No, he was the accountant
for the <i>Zhongliang.</i>

The accountant.


What do you know about
the Zhongliang Snakehead?

Sister Fong?

She's a well-respected member
of the community.

Her relocation services
have helped many people.

She's very shrewd.

They say it's bad luck to cross her.

Are you still doing tai chi?

Huh?

Tai chi.
Oh.

Oh of course, every morning.

I run everyday.

Dr. Chen says my heart's
as strong as a turtle's.

Feel that? Just like a turtle, right?

(TV PLAYING)

(GRANDMA WONG EXHALES)

(GRANDMA WONG SCOFFS)

She doesn't know that
he's the Emperor (CHUCKLES)

because he's in peasant clothes.

That's why she can be so forthright.

She still loves him though.

(GRANDMA WONG SCOFFS)

Wait till she discovers
that she's been lied to.

She will never trust him again.

Eh, it's not like that.


Have you ever been with a woman?

Yeah.

When?

Back home.

Just once.

A prostitute?

No way,

I don't need to pay for women.

GRANDMA WONG: Hmm.

Was she pretty?

Yan Yan. She's really pretty.

to give you a raise.

She won't be happy.

We shouldn't create direct
conflict with the Red Dragon.

Well, we won't tell her then.


I...

I don't know...

This really can't be.

You saved my life.

Don't worry.

You're a good boy.

DAVID: She says you should
learn Chinese, <i>bendan.</i>

MAN: Hey.
DAVID: Big Pong likes BeyoncÃ©.

PETER: Who doesn't like Bey?

DAVID: I don't.
She's a little fake.

Ma, I, uh... I hear

you and Big Pong took care of that guy.

How did you do it?

Do we know each other?

We haven't met before.

But I feel as if I already know you.

Sister Fong...

I haven't decided what to do
with you, Grandma Wong.

Things are...

very tricky now.

So many things happened.

What? What's happened?

Could you explain to me...

Oh yeah,

I heard you had an unlucky night
at the tables recently.

Perhaps you borrowed some money?


I've never borrowed money from anyone.

But if you did,
I completely understand.

After all, your husband
left you with such a mess...

You don't know anything about me!

I know that if you want to do something,

you have to do it yourself.

Isn't that right, Grandma Wong?

You can't trust anyone these days.

My accountant, for example.

White Peony tea

for stress.

Thank you, Mei Mei.


(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

How are you feeling?

Very relaxed.

Then you wouldn't mind if

we took the temperature up a little?

Whatever you want.

You're too considerate.

We have David. Bring the money.
5pm. 17-34 Hester Street.


(IN MANDARIN)
Where have you been?

Sister Fong sent me on an errand.

You're my bodyguard!

You're supposed to protect me!

They took my grandson!

Didn't you say you had no money?

This is my husband's retirement money.

Grandma...

This is Zhongliang money.

No.

Red and gold band.
Zhongliang money.

How did you get this?

Who cares!

They took my grandson!
Understand?

Because of you!

Isn't this what they were looking for?

You... you made me hurt people.

It's fate!

Fate?

Yes!

What do you know?! Huh?

You're just a gangster.

You don't know what it means
to work an honest job.

Help me.

(GRANDMA WONG EXCLAIMS)

What are you doing?

I'm taking this to Zhongliang.
Sister Fong needs to know.

(GRUNTING)
This is not your money, old woman.

Let go!

I... I don't want to hurt you.
(SCREAMS)


40 years!

We were together.
Working side by side.

Everyday from morning to night.
There was no rest.

I trusted him.

But after he died...

I found out he left me nothing.

How can there be nothing?

You have to have...

something.

Look at how much trouble you've caused.

(IN MANDARIN) Where's my grandson?

Where's Pockmark?

(DAVID GRUNTING)
GRANDMA WONG: (GASPS) David!

David!
MAN: (IN CANTONESE) Grandma,

set down the bag.

(IN MANDARIN) You let him go first.

(IN CANTONESE) This isn't a negotiation.

(IN MANDARIN)
What if I hand it over,

and you hurt him anyway?

What would I do then?

(IN CANTONESE)
Or what if I kill both of you

and then take the money?
What would you do?

(DAVID GRUNTING)

(IN MANDARIN) Ok!

Ok! Ok! Ok ok!

MAN: (IN CANTONESE) Drop it.

(IN MANDARIN) Okay, okay.

Okay.


(IN CANTONESE) What are you doing?

(IN MANDARIN) I already told you!

I didn't take your money!

(IN CANTONESE) Damn it.
Where is my money?


(IN MANDARIN) How about a trade?

MAN: (IN CANTONESE) I told you,

it's not a negotiation.

(IN MANDARIN) Let him go,

and I'll work for you.

I won't rest.
From morning to night.

(IN CANTONESE) Grandma,

you're old.

What are you going to do?

(IN MANDARIN) I'll do anything.

I'll cook...

...do laundry.

Whatever you want me to do,
I'll do it.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

I'm begging you...

I'm begging you...

I'll be loyal to you
for the rest of my life.

(IN CANTONESE) Get up!

(IN MANDARIN) He's a good kid.

He has nothing to do with this.

(SOFT RUSTLING)

I'm telling you the truth.

I didn't steal Sister Fong's money!


(IN CANTONESE)
Still pretty sharp, aren't you?

Maybe you're not so old and useless.

Come!

DAVID: (IN ENGLISH) Grandma,
you have to stay awake.

Keep your eyes open.

(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

GRANDMA WONG: If I die...

BIG PONG: No, Grandma!

GRANDMA WONG:
I'll give you my apartment.

You're a good boy.

You protected an old woman.

That girl - what was her name?

Hurry up and marry her.

Live a good life.

Make large babies.

(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)


You don't say "hi"?

(IN ENGLISH) Hi, Grandma.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Grandma, can I see your wounds?

WOMAN: Luna, we're not talking
about that, remember?

Ma, they don't need to see that... Okay.

LUNA: Gross.

Mommy said that greed
makes people do bad things.

Peter.

(ALL SINGING <i>HAPPY BIRTHDAY)</i>

(WHISTLING AND CHEERING)

Should we do presents?
KIDS: Yeah!

Do I get a present?

No, 'cause it's not
your birthday, Dumbledore.

Honey, don't call him that.

(IN MANDARIN) Open mine first.

(BIG PONG HUMS)

WOMAN: (IN ENGLISH)
Wow. What do you say?

(IN MANDARIN)
Thank you, Grandma.

WOMAN: (IN ENGLISH)
Do you want some cake, Ma?

It's sesame, not too sweet.

(CHILDREN LAUGHING IN DISTANCE)

MAN: (IN ENGLISH) Do you like it?

Uh, it faces west,
it's right next to David...

(IN MANDARIN) You can't have
an altar in the bedroom!

(IN ENGLISH) Really?

(IN MANDARIN) Of course!

You can't be naked
in front of the Buddha.

It's disrespectful.

(IN ENGLISH) No respect.

(IN MANDARIN) Can't believe
you still don't know this.

MAN: (IN ENGLISH) Ma, come on.


(IN MANDARIN) Last one.


(GRANDMA WONG SNICKERS)

Good?
(CHUCKLING)

The last one.

(CHILDREN PLAYING IN DISTANCE)

(IN ENGLISH) I should get going.

you know?

Will you think about it?

I will.
