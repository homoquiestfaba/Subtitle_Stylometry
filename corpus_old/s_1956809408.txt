jizzelda: Aaah!

[ thud ]

I'm sick of you
coming home drunk,

slapping me around!

Huh!

We're through!

T- h-r-o-o -- through.

Piece of crap.

[ flies buzzing ]

chaffino!
More ga-ga water.

I finally left him.

Who?

My boyfriend.

Lady, just drink your drink,
and get the hell out.

Well, someone's got a razor
in their rectum.

[ glass shatters ]

[ retching ]

[ gulp! ]

who's that?

That's prince lionel,
the richest,

most handsomest man
in all of villardia.

You know, they also say he takes
the cutest little poopies.

[ hissing ]

I bet.
I got to meet him.

Who has my crayons?
Grrr!

I want to color.

Squire, give me my crayons.

I don't have your crayons, sir.

I thought I brought them,
but I got all **** up.

[ grunts ]

craaaaayyyonnnnns!

Hi, I'm jizzelda, and I'd
really like to marry you.

I think we'd make
a great couple.

Ughhh.

[ laughs ]

really? You?

You like an average,
run-of-the-mill farm pig to me.

What makes you so special?

[ gulping ]

well, um, I...

[ snorting and growling ]

I happen to be
a master spinstress.

I can spin straw into crayons.

Crayons, huh?

What else can you do?

I can spin, um...

[ flies buzzing ]

...Hobo hair into...

[ squeaking ]

...New eye patches!

Oh, really?

Keep talking.

I can spin...

[ burps ]

...Cat fur into...

[ squeaking ]

...Designer plugs.

Plugs? You mean like
butt plugs?

Duh.

You intrigue me.

Here's my card.

Be at the castle
tomorrow at 8:00 a.M.

Don't be late.

[ exhales ]

[ clanging ]

[ laughing ]

jizzelda: Ahem.

Ah, there she is --
little jizzelda,

the magical crayon queen.

Well, ready to go to work?

Work?

I thought we were gonna
netflix and chill.

Soon, baby, uh, but first...

Ugh!

What -- what's happening?

You see all that straw?

I want you to turn all of it
into crayons

just like you said you could,
and if you can't do it,

I'll chop your head
off old-school.

But -- better recognize.

[ slam! ]

oh, jizzelda.

You really did it this time.

I'll just roll over
and wait to die.

[ crying ]

[ crackling ]

jizzelda?

Jizzelda?

Ah! Who said that?

It is I, rumpelstil-- ahem.

I mean, skyler.

Skyler?

I'm here to help you.

Help me escape?

No, to help you turn straw
into crayons.

You just have to agree
to one thing.

Anything, anything at all.

Watch me lick the toilet.

What?
Eww, gross.

All right.
I'll be seeing you.

No. Okay, okay,
I'll watch.

Hee, hee, hee, hee,
hee, hee, hee, hee.

[ slurping ]

ugh. Eww.
[ cackling ]

eh.

You're not looking.

Okay, skyler.
I'm looking.

[ slurping and cackling ]

gross.

Okay, let's get down
to business.

â™ª squibbidy-dee,
hoggidy-hoo, â™ª

â™ª chickity-lickity-loo â™ª

â™ª I'm making crayons

Ah!
[ giggling ]

â™ª doobidy-doop! â™ª

see you next time, butt slime.

[ sighs ]

ah.

Well, pass the ketchup.

Jizzelda, you did it!

I'm gonna give you
the biggest reward of your life.

Really?

Oof!

I can't think
of any bigger reward

than continuing
to serve prince lionel.

Now, spin that hobo hair into
some new eye patches for me.

Hiyah!

I got through eye patches like
babies go through diapers.

[ slam! ]
[ laughs ]

scotty?

Scooter?

Where is that short
little stack of shit?

[ clicks tongue ]

hey, jizzy, baby.

You looking for me,
rumpelstiltski--

uh, I mean,
uh... Dennis?

Yes.
All right.

You want me to watch you
lick another toilet bowl?

Oh, no.

This time it's really
gonna cost you.

I want you to...
Sing me a song...

About my butt crack.

Um...[clears throat]
okay.

And make it positive.

â™ª your butt crack looks
so nice and sweet â™ª oh.

I bet you shave
until it's clean and neat â™ª

[ laughs ]
keep going.

More positive.

â™ª if I were the health
inspector here â™ª

â™ª your butt would get an a
and would be all clear â™ª

â™ª your cute butt,
it smells so clean â™ª

â™ª do you wash your ass
with listerine? â™ª

â™ª and if your butt crack
could tell a tale â™ª

â™ª it would be locked up
in cute jail â™ª

oh, yes!

â™ª dibbidy-dink,
a- dinkidy-doo â™ª

â™ª a-choobidy-
chubity-choo â™ª

â™ª flibbity-flabbity-

â™ª I'm making eye patches
for you â™ª

oh, thank you.

You saved me again.

Bye for now, your stupid cow.

Cha, cha!

Hot diggity dog.

You did it again.

This calls for a celebration.

By "celebration," you don't mean
shoving me in another --

aaah!

That's absolutely what I mean.

God dammit.

And if you don't get it done
by daybreak,

I'll chop your face off.

[ slam! ]

why do I keep falling for this?

Where's that shrimpy magician?

Donny?

Dreyfuss?

Rumpelstiltski--
I mean... Cortez.

Yes.

Boy, am I in a pickle here.

Ah, say no more.

That's what I'm here for.

But first,
what can you do for me?

You name it, corty.

I want your first-born child.

First-born child?

Yeahhh.

Sure, I hate kids.

That's a deal.

Now step aside, scumbag.

I'll be back when you push out
that first kid.

[ clicks tongue ]

<i>pass the ketchup
and the mustard.</i>

Trick-baby jizzelda,
you are one magical lady.

Get over here.

I'm gonna give you hugs
for the plugs.

Oh, lionel.

Does this mean
we can get married now?

Yes, it does baby.

Ohh.

â™ª

â™ª I never knew I could love
a baby like you â™ª

â™ª all of our problems
are gone and through â™ª

â™ª you're like a rose
that blooms in the spring â™ª

â™ª one day you'll grow up
to be a wonderful king â™ª

â™ª you fill my heart
with such joy â™ª

â™ª you are my little
one-eyed baby boy â™ª

jizzy, baby?

Now, now, jizzelda.

We had a deal.

Now fork over
that little cyclops.

[ laughing ] oh, no.
I- I changed my mind.

I like my baby
and want to keep it.

That's not how deals work,
jizzelda.

[ clicks tongue ]

no!
Give me back my baby!

Jizzy, jizzy, jizzy,
I've done so much for you,

and now you want to go
back on our deal?

Okay, how about we play
a little guessing game?

What kind of guessing game?

Guess my name and keep your kid.

You get three guesses.

Okay.

What was your name?

Um, oh, boy.

Uh, hmm, I...

Weirdo q. ****brain?

What? No!

Um, fartwind poopswallow.

Ugh! God, no!

What's wrong with you, lady?

Dr. J.R.R. Take-a-shit.

Ha-ha, you're wrong
on all three.

The baby's mine.

See you later, smellavator.

No, don't take my baby,
you weird little shitbag!

Oh, you're coming with me,
you one-eyed cutie pie.

Hee, hee, hee.

Ew, the hell's wrong

Aah, aah, aah, aah!

Help!
