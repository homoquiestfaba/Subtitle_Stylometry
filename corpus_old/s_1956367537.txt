Monster Brawl!

I've got something you want.
Feel bad for the guy?

Sometimes the world's
not so black and white.

Can we--
You do it.

This is not over.
(woman screams)

It appears as if someone let her go.
(man screams)

I think we should put on a special show,

just for the employees.

(eerie music)

(chain rattles)


(light pop music)

My beloved staff members.

I always tell you that you
can't change your thoughts

until you first change your attitude!

Let me go, Micah!
A liar!

A thief!

A cheat!

A traitor!

Monster Brawl's very own Porter Harris!

(footsteps thumping)

And on the other end, you know him,

you love him.
(Colossus growling)

(electricity crackling)
(Colossus groaning)

Let's brawl!

(exciting music)
(Colossus growling)

Please, please!

I'll get the collar off.

I know she's hurting you.

Just let me get that.

(electricity crackling)
(Colossus groaning)

Please, please!

(electricity crackling)

Hey!

(Colossus growls)
(Micah yells)

(electricity crackles)
(Porter yelling)

Please!

He's hurting me!

Remember me?
Erica!

You traitor!

Go get him!

(Colossus growls)

No, no!

Come on, let's get out of here!

Look, she owes us our pay!

You can't spend money if you're dead.

I thought you were tough.

I'm also not an idiot.

Good luck.
Come on!

Back for more?
Mars, come on.

Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Mars!

Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

Here, kitty!

Please, please!

(body thuds)

(Colossus growling)

(tense music)

Give me my pay, Micah!

I didn't know you
were such a mama's boy.

Makes sense, a little baby like you.

You let me down, Porter.

You're weak!
(Porter yells)

Erica's pay too.


You know what I put in
one of these bad boys, huh?

A little kale, some avocado,

and some of my secret juice.
Just one tiny drop a day and...

Oh, honey!

You want your pay?

Come get it!

I dare you!
(Porter yelling)

(dramatic music)

Pathetic little mama's boy!

I'm changing my attitude, Micah.

It's you I hate!
(Micah laughs evilly)

And everything you stand for,

you vindictive, selfish bag!

(Micah yells)

(Micah screaming)

I'm done watching the
innocent take the fall

while the wicked walk free.

Let's show world what a
monster you really are!

Porter!

Oh, thought you might need some help.

Come on, let's go!

(Colossus growls)

I definitely mentioned I'm sorry

for taking you captive and making
you fight to the death, right?

(Erica yelps)
Wait, stop, stop!

You were a dad once, a
great one from what I know.

(Colossus growls)
People call you a monster?

I lost my mom to murderers,

people like this, people like Micah.

They're the real monsters.

Look, if you walk out that gate,
the city will hunt you down and kill you.

If you come with me, I
can give you your freedom.

Look, you can be free.
(electricity crackling)

You can be free.

(Colossus growls)

(tense music)

So where are you headed?

Take care of some unfinished business.

Oh?

It's gonna take a lot more
than that to pay me back.

I don't have a job.

I literally just saved your life.

Yeah, which wouldn't have
had to happen if you didn't...

You think that makes us even?

That nasty ass kiss?

Fuck off.
You fuck off.

Gladly.

(light music)

(Colossus growling)

(dramatic music)

(Colossus growls)

Excuse me.

Hey, excuse me.

Is everything okay?
Yeah, I think I got it.

Hey!

This yours?
Oh, gee, thanks.

My head's in the clouds today.

(tense music)
