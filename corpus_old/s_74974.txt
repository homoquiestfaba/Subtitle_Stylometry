It was a nightmare.
So many dead people.

So many victims.

Everything began some days ago behind,
when I came here.

And the remains are still rotting
and smelling of death.

That good.

Then that make?
We will lose the ship.

Greg and Simon.

Greg played baseball in the school.
Good type, only half stupid.

Simon, they say that God was generous
with him, and it is true.

He is comely, but
he doesn't have brain.

Cynthia, girlfriend of Greg.
A beauty.

Karma. She is brown
and exuberant.

She likes of Simon.

But Simon only has eyes
for Alicia, my former one.

We have finished for some weeks,
for me to be able to study and her to leave.

She adores that. I don't know which is the advantage.

You don't have one of those
invitations with map?

For sure the ship comes out of here?
Didn't they give you a missed information?

Here he says that the ship
it leaves at 17:00 o'clock.

Yes, and now they are 17:15 Simon.

Shit, we are shitted.

They lost the ship
for the party.

They had decided to stay
in Seattle, they would be alive today.

Incredible, hard the weekend
integer, you have to see it.

To that don't guess
who is here?

Hello?

The reception is horrible here.
Do tell me, dear, are you there?

Hello?

Shit.

Where you wanted to take me?

I was attempting
to make my paper of single.

But something in my head told me
that something was not well.

Hello?

That you are making here?

Good afternoon,
beautiful day, certain?

You have some problem
of audition?

I asked you a question

We wanted to rent
their ship, Mister.

Does that want, not?

But it is a pain.

This is a fishing ship,
not a floating Casino.

Why you don't look for
in the yellow pages?

We have to go to a party in an island,
and we hoped to use their ship.

Are not you hearing me, not?

I already said outside.
Or don't you speak English?

Why doesn't he say their price and do we leave this? Does a man need to
eat, not?

That leaves of it was you didn't understand?
Wait.

Jesus, arrived
the Commandant...

As much as you offer?
-that? - How much?

US $are 300 well?

But are 600 more, not?

600? No, it is a robbery.
Nobody spoke with you.

For where they go?

I don't know, we have a map, it is an island.
You will know where it is, Captain.

Is it crazy? They are crazy.

No, I believe that not.

Pardon?

I said, forget it.
That, forget it.

Forget it. He already stops to speak and veto.
Why?

Why? Why do they always ask?
Does he know like they call that island?

"Island of the Death"

Death.

It is death in Spanish.

But I believe that you don't speak to Mexican.

Friends, I have the money here.
If they are trying to win more...

He are not.

Money doesn't exist in the world
that he makes us return there.

Keep the money. Keep the money. - We will leave of here.

Curse.
That they are 1000.

I give you US $500 now,
and US $500 in the turn.

You are very persuasive, Mister...
Cruise. Sam Cruise.

My name is Kirk.

Captain Kirk?

Is he then Spock?

I don't like them of the jokes
with captain Kirk.

Better you are quiet the mouth,

before you say something
that you are sorry.

Captain? Captain?

I don't go. There are spirits
wicked in that island.

He prepares the ship and he leaves that me
do worry of the spirits, ok Salish?

Captain Kirk, is the control
of the marine of the USA.

Await for
inspection, captain.

Shit.

That he will make?

I don't have election.
I have to obey.

We will be late a little.

To be late? As much as time?

I imagine that they are looking for
you arm, drugs, I don't know that.

It will take some hours.
That if they didn't find anything.

As much as he wants to lose them?
Simon?

Can you lose them, certain?
Undoubtedly I can.

Of as much as we are speaking?

Make it.

It is an inspection
of routine, captain.

Neither think of abandoning the one
port. Where he goes with that ship?

Here Casper, the ship nine

You didn't notice it, boy,
but I would have made it free.

I like to make of
Time Popeye in when.

Then already he did escape before from her?

Of course.

but she continued working
for the Tío Sam.

It is a game that her

We go there.

Of agreement.

My God.
It is very cold, affection.

He walks, we go.

No, you go you love.

Why don't you enter? They come, Matt.
You are very boring.

They are going for the Island
of the Death, captain.

Only maintain the speed
and the distance.

I don't want that they see each other, still.

It should have been something that I ate.

Be icy!

Greg, you are very bad. Tomato another
beer, you will feel better

It returns here.
We go, Matt.

We go, Matt,

Good view, pervert?

He wanted to give you this.

So that?

For protection.

Ok, Salish.

Hey, boys, there are.

Now calm.

Leave me to the other side of the island.

He wants him to call reinforcements.
Not. I can be in charge of of alone Viktor.

We go. Good place
for our merchandise.

It begins to discharge.

If Casper comes behind us,
he didn't find anything to accuse us.

It is here.

wait. It lets him to see that.

Obviously you are not a cartographer.
That sews?

We go, it is here.

Is it quite clever, certain?
it is true.

As clever as for not entering
with somebody as your.

It seems that somebody happens here.

This old one.

Captain, captain.

It seems that he comes
a storm.

It seems that yes.
But there is not problem.

It will maintain
to Casper far

if he tries to come after
us. We will be able to escape.

And the boys?

We cannot leave them
alone. This island is bad.

I won't wait
for them.

Not if we have one
opportunity to escape from Casper.

It continues discharging.
This well, captain.

Very well. We will return

Do I listen something, captain?
No, anything.

Where all are?

I cannot believe this.

Problem of them, in this place

I don't know if it is a good idea.
He knew that you would say that. Be not silly.

I remember when it was amusing.
When, in the garden of infants?

This bloodstained one.

It seems that something bad happens here.

As what?

We don't need go to buy
beer, the barrel is full. - Let us see!

A toast.
Chin-chin.

Health.

Is not this bothering anybody?

In the island there would be a party,
but all desert is.

I worry about it. I worry about there to be
so much drink that we won't be able to her to take.

You are right, friend.

I don't know you, but I will attempt
to discover where all are.

Somebody more he comes?

No, I and Cynthia will play

Ok, I go with you. I will be
diabetic with so much sweetness here.

Fair what we need,

Certain. We go.

I always have that

Captain? Captain, are you?

Hello everybody!

Towards that. - Why?

Because I want sex.
Do you want sex?

But late.

We will close. Velcro, beautiful velcro.
We go to the nuesto, baby.

Several men have that problem.

See to make in the overgrowth.

He listens, I only want to urinate.
I will make in some place.

Hello?

It is so calm.

It is a beautiful night, why

It seems to have been built
millennia ago.

Simon, centuries.

Certain, that was it

Will we be able to enter?

I don't enter there.
Me neither. It is alone, baby.

They come or I will have
that to enter alone?

Do you never dress Scooby-Doo?

It is not a good idea.

I am completely in
against of making this.

The brands are fastened.
Somebody should have at home.

Hello?

We were drinking, dancing

Those things arrived and they began
to kill everybody.

Those that could escape,

Those things continued
arriving and killing.

Finally we find
this house and we enter.

We think that they were more than them.
Who are they?

Who? I try to know it.

They are dead people.
You saw the tape.

I cannot believe it, but they are left revived bodies of a movie of Rosemary."

Left from where?

Of George Rosemary's movie.
The trilogy of the Night of the Alive Deads.

They say that they will make another movie,
ero I doubt it.

It is I very difficult to believe this.

It is a mischief, it leaves of the party.
It is not a mischief, Alicia.

I say that we should
to leave of here.

Let us leave that the police
take charge of this,

we will arrive to Seattle
before they discover us.

This well.
Do you have a ship?

Yes, in the beach.
Thanks to God.

Let us don't lose time, we go.

We are not able to, still
we have friends there

in the party, not
we will abandon them.

We have to leave of
here while we can.

Not without them.

We go.

Then, did you come with that girl?

I go to give you a hint,
I believe that she is not an American.

I met her in the party.

And your boy, with smile of
Tom Cruise and brain of Rain Man?

He is one of the best
models from America, if you wanted to know.

congratulations.

That well.
Are you well, Simon?

Clear.

Where devils entered?

Greg? Cindy?
Please, don't make that.

Don't worry.
This is only a joke.

If you had been here not

Sustain it.

We will give it turn.

Liberty.

But that shit step with you?

That devils were that thing?

Our best friend

It is no longer more it.

It seemed a wild animal.

Did they see their face?
My God, was horrible.

That pass with her?
Wait an instant.

Perhaps I get some answers.

McGyvers, respond.

Here Casper. Respond, change.

I won't get anything in the radio.
Does somebody have a cellular one?

we already attempt, it doesn't work.
He has some interference type.

I don't know that it is happening,
but it is necessary to leave the island.

As they arrived here?

In ship, as all, but
it is not, it was destroyed.

Ours not. We arrive last, with Kirk. - Where he is?

It is in the bay.
Can you take me until him?

-AND the rest?
-for now not.

Now only I want to take them
him but far for its well

It is a good plan for me.

I am so afraid, Simon.
I know it, me also.

I cannot believe that
Cynthia is dead.

I sit down it a lot, Alicia.

Still.

All still ones

We can go home

We will leave

Move! Let us go!

We will look for Kirk.
He has to be here!

Allow me to see you.

Can you give me your coat?
Curse! God that shit!

Curse.

Are you medical?

I made a course of first aids.
First aids, am there?

At least I met him healthy.

Oh, my God. Allow me to see.

Was a bite?
Yes.

This well.

I have to return to the ship it patrols
to request help for radio.

Wait, he will leave us here
while it looks for the chivalry?

No, you come with me.

Me? Why me?

Are you medical?
Not.

Is it wounded?
Not.

Does he know how to use a weapon?
For that reason you come.

The ship this
of the other side.

We will try to arrive and
to request aid, expert?

We go.

Greg. My name is Greg.
Walking, Greg.

That devils were those things?

I don't know, but now I know because they call
to this island Island of the Death"

I have to make this.
I need to make it

It should have some type of
scientific explanation for this

Liberty is right.
They should have suffered some mutation.

That? For the hole of ozone?
Didn't they use solar protector?

They are zombis and final point.

While sooner
let us accept that,

more opportunity will have
of leaving of here alive.

Captain, its
sailor believed that...

you wise something
on the island that was?

Anything besides legends.
As that of the dead-alive ones?

Well, for that that
I remember of the history,

there was a
Crazy Spanish " father ".

It was banished of Spain,
centuries ago.

Their name was Castillo Sermano.

Did you ask to see me, Padre Castillo?

He comes more fence, captain,
I cannot see their face.

Is he afraid, captain?

He knows why I was
exile from Spain?

Their experiments were not of God.
God?

That he made God for you, or for me?

Anything.

Any God doesn't exist. Only me.
That He has pity of their soul.

The Spaniards attempted
to reach the coast.

They never arrived there.

They say that he murdered the
company of the San Cristobal,

it enslaved those
native of this island...

and it killed to all those that
they came from then on.

Some say that him still bush.
Excuse to have asked.

For me, it is only
pirates' history...

and smugglers
to move away people.

Do you understand of the matter, truth?
That can say?

They have made
a good work, truth?

that that was?

I don't hear anything.
Neither me.

Greg, run. Run!

Greg?

We cannot stay here,
we are very vulnerable.

I already know, but not
we can leave of here...

while Casper
and Greg doesn't return.

We have to return
to the ship, but me,

I don't enter to the water of
any way.

No, it is very far and also
we don't know who is on board.

And that house?

It is good to defend,
we will have refuge.

Ok, is a good idea.

We go there they hardly return.
And if they don't return?

They will return.
And if they don't return that make?

We don't have weapons, food,
we don't have a shit.

I know that we will make.

You should
to be joking.

Is Casper for that reason after his?
Does it smuggle pure Cubans?

And some other things.

I see that you are still
in the smuggling, Viktor.

You would Like to be able to
to prove that, truth Jordan?

And that this is?

Then, we already have it.
Clear.

That madness, not?

We have problems
but big,

my ship was destroyed
and my assistant disappeared.

And Greg, Casper, where it is?

I believe that it didn't get it.

That he means with
"Do I believe that it didn't get it?"

He left. I Sit down it a lot.
We have go to look for it!

It can be that him this well,
and we cannot abandon him there.

it is dead.

And you will end up as him if not
you are quiet the mouth and you listen to it.

That you have there besides pure?
Some useful thing?

I will present them
to my small friend.

Who said that the size
doesn't it care?

Very Well!. For my
the biggest.

Gauge big.
Take the shotgun,

some opportunity.

I left the better couple the last one.

Here it is. Take!

Good election. Desert Eagle.

I like like you think, girl.

We cannot stay here,
those creatures are everywhere.

We planned to go until
the house that we find.

Good idea. We can tolerate
until help arrives.

If the help comes.

Don't worry.
When they don't receive...

our report the marine one
he will come to look for us.

Do all know how to manage their weapons?

shit!
We have to enter in the house.

And if they are inside?

We will have to take the house,

and we will defend better there
inside of that here out.

My God!

Here, all.

To the house!

Trancada is.
Let us give the turn.

Explode the door.

It economizes bullets, it is
better to use them with them.

Forget it, we go to
to find another entrance.

Care, grenade.

You shoot well.

My God!

Rudy!

No!

McGyvers.

I need more ammunition.
I don't have none.

Ok? You look at me.

You look at me. Did you save me, ok?

You saved us.

We are walled!

We will put it in the table.

I will look for something
to be treated.

Simon, looks at the other ones.

I Sit down it a lot.
Where this Casper?

She could not arrive.
I sit down it a lot.

This All well.

Captain, it will hurt.

We go, make it. Make it.

Is it prepared?
Yes.

Give me my lighter. Here.

Curse.

Don't look at me.

I seem a monster.

Simon, allow me to look...
Salt of here. I don't need your help.

Like it is, Kirk?
Well. Well

Rest a little.

Do you have some idea?
I don't know it.

That he will spend?

It doesn't care.

For me it cares!

Won't we be able to leave of here?

Still leaving of here, I am completed.

Who will want to look
a face like east?

I am a circus aberration.
Don't speak this way.

I believe that you were very valiant today.

And I believe that even
you are very sexy.

You don't make it so that
did it feel better, certain?

I am making this for
to feel better me.

It is so calm.

Yes, too calm.

Look at that.

What?

Where are dragging them?

That are making with the bodies?
I have a bad presentimento.

That it happened?

Rudy That I happen?
That it cares?

She is dead. I didn't save her.

It was not your blame.
The blame was mine!

It was my blame!

Were you here?
Did you dress him?

You dressed when she was
being quartered?

It won't happen again.

We will leave of here.

Hey, is Kirk. It is better to look at it,
it is worsening.

As it is, captain?

I would like a swig.

It is all that we have.

It is not what I had in mind,
but thank you equally

We will give one
look to this book.

It is very old,
perhaps he helps us.

Well, tell me the truth.
Will I improve or not?

We are in a crisis.

There is not " water " and still
they are many of them.

Perhaps be better to leave
of making of babysitter

and to begin to worry
for you.

That he has in mind?

Look in the rest of the house,
look that they can use

to be protected better.

It is not necessary as knowing if it is that even
they won't try to enter here.

Perhaps have not left of here.

Boys, it seems that
a ship robbed here.

The newspaper of I approach
he says that Castillo Sermano

the captain killed, it beached
the ship and it set on fire it.

The history that Kirk counted
he has felt now.

Better you go now.
Go!

Of agreement.

Will it be well?

If. But, I can
to have this.

The captain is right,
we have to leave of here

and to watch over the rest
of the house.

We go.

We will begin

That all this is?

There is there inside something.

Rudy. I cannot open it.
Is trancada?

Yes.

Who was here? God.

This is disgusting.

It excuses.

This is incredible.

Why don't they live as the other ones?
I don't know it.

Prostitute's son.

After every year,
finally it is certain.

The blood. It is alive.

Fantastic.

It works.

I will live forever.

Forever.

They believe that they can

So many deads.
So many victims.

People that were
