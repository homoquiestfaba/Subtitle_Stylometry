I'm sorry, Krager.

It just split on me.

Mr. Simmons?

You may want to take a look at this.

Damn.
That's a special order.

That'll set us back 6 weeks.

Just replace it with a standard frame.

It's got to be exactly like the original.

It's in the bid.

I can match it.

Who's that?

Noah dearborn.

He's a carpenter god.

When?

Now.

It's almost 3:00,
Mr. Dearborn.

Gimme a couple of hours.

2 hours?

Maybe a little more.
Not much.

No way.

No offense, pal.

I can do it.

Got 20 bucks says he can do it.

You're on.

Want to bet?

Come on.
He can do it.

Yep.
Here we go.

$20. You in?

Cash in?

Boy, let's see it.

No way.

When you work with wood...

You gotta have the right set of knives.

If you don't have the right knives,

then you got to cut your own.

Noah, I need you to go help your father.

Noah.

Noah.

Mind your mother, boy.

Silas, I know he's kin to you,
but he's your brother's boy.

He doesn't want to do anything
but watch you work.

Well, the boy's got this special...

Single-mindedness.

He sets his head to something

and shuts out everything else.

I ain't never seen nothin' like it.

Where'd you find this guy?

Noah's the first one on
the jobsite in the morning,

the last one to leave in the evening.

Nothing seems to interest him
but his work.

In my mind, that makes him a noble man.

5 minutes left, Noah.

No, he's still gotta paint it.

The hell he does.

Rico, Duncan, mix up those paints.

Noah!

Noah! Noah!

Hoo!

Gonna make it!

There it is!

I put in a little extra
for saving my behind.

You're welcome.
Listen, Noah...

I'll come out to the farm
and let you know

when we have something that's
worthy of your special skills.

Mighty kind.

Hey, we're heading down to
the red and gray pub for a few.

Friend asked me to stop by
and look at some repairs.

It'd be unmannerly of me
to leave her waiting,

but thanks just the same.

See you.

You didn't tell him you were the one

who built it in the first place?

Nope.

Why not?

They didn't ask.

How'd you say it broke?

I guess it was my niece or my nephew.

Table's been in our family
for more than 3 generations.

You ready for your pie?

Yes.

There's no hurry.
I'm just glad you can fix it.

My good fortune.

What?

Every time I come here to mend something,

there's a hot pie coming out of the oven.

How you doing?

I'm looking for a Noah dearborn.

That's me.

Noah dearborn sr.

A gentlemen of about 90 or so?

The... proprietor?

Mister, your fancy word
don't change the fact

I'm Noah dearborn.

Well, I see your point there.

Well, Noah, when's the last time
you had a really good day?

Today.

Ok. When was the last time
you had a really great day?

Can't say I know what you're getting at.

I'm sorry. Let me cut
to the chase here.

And I represent a private
real estate concern,

and we are prepared to offer you $300,000

for your land today.

In cash.

350. And that's
a hundred thousand

over the most generous
appraisal of this place, too.

Don't mean to be disrespectful, but...

This land's not for sale.

You drive a hard bargain, sir.

All right. 400,000
in cash today.

What do you think?

No, thank you.

Mr. Dearborn, think about
all the time you'd have

to relax and enjoy your life.

My work's my life.

If you want to stay busy
with all that money,

I can get you 2 years work
on this project here.

The things you say don't seem
to follow what you're meaning.

You want to buy my land.

I told you...
It's not for sale.

I know what he's thinking.

I know what they're all thinking.

Did he give you anything specific?

You mean did I allow him
to insult me further?

Hell, no.
I'm not a glutton.

You allow someone to forge
ahead on you like that,

it's a sign of weakness.

Earl, I want to tell you
what I'm hearing you say.

You don't trust the people you work with.

You don't feel appreciated by your boss.

You can't wait to leave
the office every day.

Now, if you were to envision
yourself in a different job,

surrounded by new people,

would you like what you do?

I don't know. I never
thought about that.

I want you to think about it.

All right.

But we're out of time now.

Same time next week?

Yes, that's right.

Good-bye, doctor.

Take care now.

This is Dr. Crane.

My love, how are you?

Missing you.

Me, too.

Where are you, in the city?

Still stuck down here
in mayberry, r.F.D.

Christian...

Yeah?

Are you forgetting anything?

The John Portman exhibit, right?

I'm really up against it
down here, honey.

I'll make it up to you, I promise.

I'm still 2 hours out of the city.

I just can't make it back in time.

Call me later.
Maybe I'll pick up.

Ouch. That hurt.

Bye.

On this dearborn property,

if we secure this loan in 29 days,

it's a $50 million project, people.

Let's get on it, ok?

Well, give him some time to mull it over.

He'll come around.

I'm not so sure.

I'm not so sure this is the
Noah dearborn we're after.

The deed says the man's pushing 100,

but the guy I talked to
didn't look a day over 55.

Maybe he killed the old man
and assumed his identity.

Maybe the guy is just deluded.

Then you'd have a case
for mental incompetency,

and we could push for him

becoming a ward of the state.

Well, we know he's incompetent.

Who else would turn down
that amount of money?

Well... I'd like to meet
the man myself.

My daddy always said...

"The eyes never lie."

If he's deranged...

I'll get him out of there.

Gentlemen.

This mental incompetency thing,

how do you prove something like that?

Well, there was this case last year

up in Lincoln county.

They got a letter from
an accredited psychologist.

There was a comprehension hearing

and the old lady was
declared mentally unstable.

The estate was awarded to the county.

So when are you two ever
going to get hitched?

We're not thinking about that right now.

What? If you ask me, val,

guys like Christian don't
fall off turnip trucks.

You're really pushy, you know that?

I don't know.
I don't listen to you.

Hi, Sterling.

Hello, ladies.

Hi.

So, how's the criminal records division?

Lots of criminals, lots of records.

You're changing the subject again.

Nothing.
It's just my pager.

Speak of the devil.

You're an educated 21st century woman.

Val, don't be so accommodating.

I'll be right back.

Listen, sweetie,
could you do me a big favor?

I need you to meet me down
there in that little town,

just for a couple of days.

It's kind of important.

What's so urgent?

It's not urgent.

Just need you there for moral support.

Plus, there's this thing
I need to discuss with you.

What thing?

I'll tell you when you get down there.

I'm gonna have to reschedule
a lot of appointments.

Please, honey, I wouldn't ask
you if it wasn't important.

Well, I'll definitely
make it worth your while.

Ok?

I gotta go.

So go already.

Ok. Bye-bye.

Noah dearborn.

Yes, sir?

Robert Murphy.

I was told to look for an older,
good-looking gentleman,

but, you look like you're fit enough

to still be throwing a javelin.

I don't mean to be
disrespectful, but I...

Got the same answer
I gave the other fella.

This is a beautiful piece
of property you have here.

Do you split and stack
all this wood by yourself?

Yes, sir.

Got a spell to go, though.

Well, I'll help you.

There's no sense in me
taking up all your time

that's ok.
I can manage by myself.

Ok.

Stuck.

Water?

Can't remember the last time a stranger

offered to help me with my chores.

I'm just glad to get out of that suit

and do some manual labor.

I feel younger already.

Thank you.

You make wine, too?

No. Apple Brandy.

Do you mind if I have a taste?

I guess you earned it.

What... what did you say you came here for?

We're gonna get right back
on schedule as soon as...

Right.

Well... well, how high an offer

am I authorized to make, sir?

Ok.

Well, twin pines mall

is going to be a tremendous success, sir.

And, have a good time on your cruise.

And you are?

Come here.

Good to see you.

For me?

Maybe.
Open it.

Open it now.
Hurry. Come on.

Just a little something I picked up.

Ahem.

They're beautiful.

You like 'em?

Try it on.

Yeah.

Yeah, come on.

You put it on.

You like that?

You like it?

You look beautiful.

What was so urgent?

What was so urgent?
I'll show ya.

This Scott woman had
this beautiful estate

reduced to squalor.

She'd fired all of her staff,

the grounds were ruined,

so you think this dearborn man
is like that?

I hope not.

I am concerned, though.

He seems a little... a little off.

So, if you can prove
he's mentally unstable,

then you can have him
removed from his home.

I don't want anybody
removed from their home,

but he's out there all alone,

and if he's not well,

it might be that he's better off

plus, we're willing to pay him
very well for his land.

How much?

650.

It must be a great piece of land.

Go.

What? What'd I say?

No, I just feel a little
weird about this.

Look, I know this is
really sudden, but...

I just want your take on this guy.

Ok.

See what I can do.

I win.

Is she a Jersey, the... the white one?

Holstein.

My parents have a place north of here.

I used to spend summers there, and th...

This place makes me wish
they weren't selling it.

Neighbor had a big Jersey, and I...

Used to help milk her.

Come a long way from...

Milking your neighbor's cow.

I'm Valerie crane.

All this attention here lately...

Making me feel a little important.

Lots of visitors?

Yes, ma'am.

Are you Noah dearborn?

I mean, is there another Noah dearborn?

No.

I know this will sound forward,

especially coming from a stranger.

How old are you?

I'm not selling my land.

I... I'm not here to buy.

A friend asked me to come and meet you.

Your friend made you come all this way

to find out how old I am?

No. Actually,
I heard you own

one of the last unblemished
pieces of property.

I wanted to come and meet the owner,

maybe talk a little.

Mile past the first stop sign in town,

you see a sign for mccellan's.

Nice place. Nice lady
name of Sarah.

She likes to talk
about as much as you do.

Makes nice pie.

Excuse me...

I don't mean to be disrespectful,

but all you people

come out here dressed as lambs,

but you smell like foxes.

Have a nice day.

This is Evelyn.

Hi, it's val.

Listen, how would I find out
the age of a person

who doesn't want to give it?

Ask one of his relatives, val.

Please, Evelyn, this is important.

Well, there's the social security office,

the dmv,

or if you had a friend

in the criminal records division...

I need some information
on a man named Noah dearborn.

Twin pines...
Have you got that?

See if you can get a photograph, too.

I'm on it.

You're a Saint.

So, how are things going on down there?

Stop being so nosy.

Heh. I'll stop
being so nosy

when you stop being so secretive.

Ok, got to go. Bye.

Val...

Hi, sue.

How you doing, Marge?

It's good to see you both.

Enjoying the Turkey?

The best.
Just the best.

Hey.

Hey.

What happened?

I lied through my teeth,
and he saw right through it.

He's crazy, right?

How could I possibly make that assumption

after a brief conversation?

No, honey, I'd have to
sit down with the man,

give him a standardized test,

and then I'd have to discuss my findings

wait, wait, wait.
A team of specialists?

Psychiatric evaluation team.

Howdy. How you doin'?

Is everything going all right here?

Great.
Good.

Hi.
Hi.

You must be Sarah.

I hear your pie is very good.

Well, most people think so,

unless they're telling me a big lie.

Would you like some?

What is it?
It's peach.

Sure.

Comin' right up.

You know, Murphy hadn't
come back to the office

since he went down there.

Well, then, I guess
I'm lucky to be alive.

Honey...

I promise you when this project is over,

we'll go to Hawaii or something.

I want it in writing, please.

I, Christian Nelson, do hereby swear

to take...

I hate these.

I will be right back.

Sorry.

Would you guys stop paging me
every 23 seconds?

What's the deal?

Really?

That's actually ok, 'cause we're...

Had a sort of a slight
change of plans here.

A whole bunch of experts on this thing.

Now, that's the day
they finished the building.

That's my father there on the right.

I was no more than 10 years old.

What a beautiful photograph.

Thank you.

I wish I had more of them.

Who's this man?

Well, that's Noah dearborn.

He's, he's kind of a local hero.

He built most of the town.

Is this date right,
though? 1956?

He doesn't seem to have
aged more than a day.

From that big land development,
now, would you?

No.
No, I'm, I'm not.

My boyfriend is.
I'm just a bystander.

Yeah, I'll have somebody
bring you the bill.

Did I say something to offend you?

I'm... I'm sorry.

What was that all about?

I wish I knew.

Why don't you finish this first?

Yes, ma'am.

Well, you best speak your mind.

No sense in keeping
all them words inside you

when you're fit enough to speak.

Mama says you never get sick.

She said the lord
never wants to take you.

She said you're
the oldest man in the world.

Well...

I'll tell you a secret.

When a man loves his work,

truly loves it...

Sickness and death
will get tired of chasing you.

And just finally give up
and leave you alone.

Clear your mind of all that concerns you

and do the right thing

with those hands that god gave you.

You hear me talking to you?

Here we go.
Noah dearborn.

No criminal record.

Born 1908.
Twin pines, Georgia.

My god.

Nothing.
That helps.

That helps a lot.
Thank you.

Hello.

Good afternoon.

Hi.

I hope I'm not interrupting.

I was just leavin'.

I assure you I won't take up
much of your time.

Good. I don't have much
for you to take up.

Sarah just about gabbed my ears on fire.

My.

You manage all this without electricity?

Yes, ma'am.

How do you work at night?

I work during the day
when it's light out.

If, I have to finish and it's late,

I'll burn a few oil lamps.

Have you ever been out
of twin pines before?

Once or twice.

I don't seem to remember.

Would you pass me that rag, please?

So... so you've
never traveled

or taken a plane or a train?

It seems to me I took
a train once with my daddy.

Can't say I remember when it was.

You ever heard of a musical group

called the Beatles?

No.

Golden gate bridge?

No.

Elvis Presley?

Yeah.

Elvis?

Sure.

Mr. Dearborn,
I'm a clinical psychologist,

and I'd just like to talk to you

about the way you live,

and maybe I could...

Take what I learn and use it somehow...

That's all that's in it for me, honest.

I'm...

No fox.

I can't draw a long bow with you.

There's work to be done.

Some folks are longwinded

when a small breeze will do just fine.

Mr. Dearborn,
I'm only trying to figure out

how you've stayed the way you are.

I mean, how you've managed
to stay so young.

Obviously, there's a lot that you know.

Where are we going?

Who's buried here?

My folks.

And Silas.

Who's Silas?

My uncle and best friend.

Did you ever get...

Young lady, most of the time,

I like to be alone to do my work.

Now, if that'll help those folks

back there in the city feel better

like you want, well...

Take that with you.

I understand.

This is a little intrusive.

I'm sorry.

Do you ever get sick?

Ain't got no time to be sick.

So you've never been to a hospital?

I've got lots of things to do.

Too many questions for one day.

You sure you're not kin
to Sarah mccellan?

He's... he's a miracle.

He's totally uncontaminated
by modern life.

It's as though the world
orbits around him,

and he's managed not to engage.

It's his discipline

and his passion for his work, I think,

that's... that's kept him so young and...

So he's not gonna sell?

Christian, can we leave
that alone for a moment

and appreciate
what's been discovered here?

Am I interrupting something?

Where the hell have you been?

I can come back later.

What happened to you, man?

You left us high and dry.

I apologize, Christian, but...

I'm not practicing law anymore.

Well, that's... that's a good one.

Yeah. Yeah, I'm selling
my shares in the firm.

We're buying into
this vineyard in sonoma.

And...
I'm gonna be a winemaker.

What?

No, please, no.
I'm not staying.

Christian, I just...

I just reevaluated everything
in my life and...

And what's important to me.

I'm sorry.

I mean, you and I
have made a lot of money

over the years, but...

I just...

I just missed out on so much.

What, you mean this?

Yeah.

I do.

I'll send you a postcard

and hopefully a damn good bottle of wine.

Take care.

What's... what's going on?

Tsk. Well, it's a...

Good thing you went down there.

Otherwise, you never would have met

that Mr. Hidden treasure
of a man, now, would you?

Look at Murphy.

And he just changes
his whole life entirely.

Gotta shut that guy down

before he starts his own damn religion.

What?

What?

Valerie?

Valerie?

I'll beat you to the ice cream store.

I'm gonna get chocolate chip.

I'm gonna get vanilla.

Noah?

Mr. Dearborn!

Hey.

Hello.

Goin' to market?

No. No, young lady.

Mind if I ride along?
I've never been in one of these.

More questions.

Please? I'd like
to talk to you.

Maybe I can help.

You handy with a hammer and a saw?

I'm afraid not.

Then...

What kind of help you talking about?

Some people would argue
that by giving up your land

you'd make a considerable
amount of money to retire on.

Where would I go?

When they had the idea
round to begin with.

I could have saved them
a lot of time and worry.

You understand you're
going to have to fight this?

A man has to fight for something

that belongs to him in the first place

don't seem right.

Don't you get lonely?

No.

You ever been married?

No.

Handsome man like you?

Hard to marry when you're...

Always tripping over your own tongue.

Sarah mccellan doesn't
seem to feel that way.

Being alone don't seem to me

like such a bad thing.

What about your family?
Your uncle Silas?

You said he was your best friend.

You sure ask a lot of questions.

After a while, answering them

is like tossin' 55-pound bags of cement.

It just wears you out.

Mr. Dearborn.
Mr. Dearborn.

Hi, Mr. Dearborn.

Hi.

Hi.

Hello!

Hello!

Afternoon.

Afternoon.

Brought you some things.

Came to fix the door.

That's very kind of you.

I wasn't expecting company.

Ain't no company.

Won't take but a minute.

Look at them ears.

Big as a cat.

Big as a cat.

Good year this year.

Do you want some lemonade?

That'll be nice.

And for your friend?

This is miss Valerie.

She be askin' a lot of questions.

That's her job.

Does he come here often?

The kids think he's Santa claus,

only Mr. Dearborn comes
more than once a year.

We weren't expecting

a new screen door, though.

You need to treat your home
with a little more care.

All right,
Mr. Dearborn.

Well, best be off.

Ma'am.

Thanks again.

Be back soon enough.

Thank you for the drink.

Any time.

She didn't ask too many questions.

She's quiet as a baby barn owl.

She likes to talk to me.

Of course, she thinks I don't know much.

That way she can help other folks.

Bye.

Lemonade go down wrong?

No, no.

How long you been doing this?

As long as I've grown
more than I could eat.

Take care.

There is a man that came to see you,

and something that you said
must have changed his life.

Can't say I know what
you're going on about.

A man called Murphy.

The lawyer fella.

Yeah.
What did you say to him?

Didn't say much.

He had a bit of apple Brandy.

He seemed to do most of the talking,

said something about
wanting to make wine.

That was it? You didn't
tell him anything or...

I was just asking what good
is wanting to do something

without going on and doing it.

He's a nice man.

Very smart.

Like you.

He wasn't much on chopping wood, though.

Mr. Dearborn,
we have a court order.

Right this way, sir.

So, let's call the utility company...

What in heaven's name have you done?

Let's take a quick break, shall we?

My god, that's a little
extreme, don't you think?

Extreme?
You pay someone to lie,

you have a man removed from his home

so you can make some money?

Besides, you had nothing
to do with that part of it.

You're the one who dragged me down there

Valerie, I'm sorry you think
that I misled you,

but I happen to care
about my life and career.

And I want you to be part of it,

but you're not letting me.

Where is he?

He's being properly evaluated.

Honey, you know, Valerie...

Valerie, I think you just got a little

too involved, honey.

Ok? Honey?

I'm... I'm sorry to bother you.

You should have left him alone.

Where's he gone?

Some men took him.

All of you should be ashamed.

I know I'm a stranger, but I'm a doctor.

I'm the only person
who can help him right now,

and you can't.

You people treat him
like he's some kind of god.

He's just a lonely old...

Let me tell you something.

You know, several years ago,

Noah's best friend
in the world passed on.

Silas.

And after he was gone,

Noah just seemed to shut down.

It was years before
anyone heard him speak.

All he'd do from sunup
to sundown is work.

Finally, one day, all of us felt so bad,

we got together, we got Noah a dog.

He took care of him, he fed him,

he even let him sleep inside the barn,

but you know something?

He never once touched that dog.

He never pet him.

I don't understand.

Noah can't touch things he cares about.

Somehow, by god's will,

the further away he stays

from everything but his work,

the more he's protected.

You come here from I don't know where.

To you it may seem a little unfit,

but that's what makes
the man the way he is.

What's unfit to me is that
he's locked up somewhere,

and I can't help him
unless you tell me where he is.

Well...

They got him in the mental hospital.

It's 2 counties north.

You should go look in on your father.

I can't.

What do you mean you can't?

Your daddy is sick.

Go look in on him.

All right.

Noah, c-come here, son.

Come here, son.

Don't be disrespectful.

They're going to take me to the hospital.

You the man of the house now.

These 35 acres here gonna be yours.

You...

You take care of your mama, you hear?

You t-t...

Mr. Dearborn, do you
know why you're here?

No.

Mr. Dearborn, a board
certified physician

sent us a letter stating
you were displaying

strange and peculiar behavior.

Yes, in this letter,

he stated that you may be a danger

to yourself and others.

So, we've been ordered by the court

to keep you under observation

for a minimum required amount of time.

Do you understand,
Mr. Dearborn?

I can't say that I do.

I don't mean to be disrespectful

to you all,

but I got a lot of work to do.

Have a good day.

Would any of you happen to have the key?

Mr. Dearborn.

We have a lot of questions to ask you.

That's going to be kind of hard.

You see, I don't have much to say.

I don't like it here.

Where's the psychiatric ward?

Elevator's down the hall
and on the right.

Thank you.

Have you lost interest
in social activities?

You mean like playing the fiddle

or going to the barn dance?

Yes.

There's never enough time during the day.

I sleep at night.

Mr. Dearborn,

have you ever had any long relationships?

I had a dog.

With another human.

I have friends.

Friends?

Don't you know what they are?

What are we trying to
establish here, Mr. Dearborn,

is whether you have
physical contact with anyone.

Do you ever have suicidal thoughts?

That's...

Not a very kind thing

to ask a fella you don't even know.

Hello,
I'm Dr. Valerie crane,

and I believe you have
a man under 72-hour hold.

He was brought in today.
His name is dearborn.

Yes, the doctors are with him now.

Where is he?
I need to see him.

He's being evaluated.

I'll need clearance
to take you back there.

I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

If there's been one tiny infraction

I'll have the board of
medical quality assurance

you won't be able to get another job

for the rest of your life.

Is that enough clearance for you?

Down the hall on
the left. Room 315.

Wait. I have to
notify the doctors

that you're coming.

Then notify them.
Wait!

Do you ever recall having trouble

suppressing disturbing thoughts?

What do you mean?

Well, do you ever have bad thoughts

that you cannot hold inside?

Well...

I'm starting to feel

that you people ought to be ashamed

of asking all these questions

that don't mean nothing.

Gentlemen,
I'm Dr. Crane.

Noah, would you go with
this young lady for a moment?

I have some information for the doctors

that they'll be
more than interested to hear.

Never taught you one bit of manners.

Are you all right?

I don't like hospitals.

Too many sick people.

I feel like you deserve
a very big apology

for what's happened.

I'm not the only one who owes it to you.

You ever been in a car like this?

Yes. Fella gave me
a ride to work

in one lots like this one.

Can't understand much.

You mean why they took you
from your property?

So many buttons and gadgets.

What?

Can't understand why

folks need to know more
than how fast they're travelin'

and how much gas is in the tank.

No, I know you're not gonna
like what I'm gonna say,

but we have a term for what
you're doing right now.

It's called avoidance.
You see...

You're making your mind
think about something else

in order to not deal with
what you're really feeling.

Noah?

Truck.

My god!

Maybe there should be a button

for keeping you to go straight.

She did what?

You... you didn't...

No. Don't... don't
get hysterical.

No, you... you're not
gonna lose your licenses.

Just sit tight.

Yeah. Ok.

This machine's out of money.

I'll just write a check.

I'll be right back.

Honey, I have the receipt.

All right.

Hmmph! Darn thing
is always out of money

when you need it most.

I don't want to go.

Hope I didn't take too long.

No.

Shall we go?

Thank you for spending the day with me.

I guess it was kind of
selfish of me to keep you.

I bought you some books.

I didn't even think to ask you.

"Book of five rings"?

If you wanted to know if I read,

you might've just asked.

"Wuthering heights."

It's a classic.

It's about doomed and unrequited love.

It's one of my favorites,
and I thought you...

Noah, I know Silas was a great man,

and he taught you really well...

But he didn't teach you everything.

We need other people to survive.

Sun's going down.

I got things to do.

More questions tomorrow?

No.

I'm going to be leaving.

I think I'll go visit my parents' farm.

Then I should thank you now

for looking after me when you did.

Thank you.

Noah.

Yeah?

You don't have to give up your land.

I don't aim to.

I'm sorry, what I said before in the car

about denial.

I guess it's just my nature to...

Try to help.

Don't get your dander up, young lady.

I wasn't paying much
attention to it anyhow.

I'd really like to spend...

Never mind.

Bye.

That word you used...

Avoid something or other?

I thought you weren't paying attention.

I'm going to miss you.

Young lady...

If you find yourself back this way,

and you need some money,

you don't have to fret with a machine.

I got plenty under the mattress.

Thank you.

Down creek.

You set it down there yet?

Yeah, see, the property line...

Good morning.

Did you sleep well?

Well enough.
Thank you.

Are you leaving us so soon?

Yes, I am.

I'm sorry to see you go.

Well, I'll get your bill.

Be just a moment, dear.

You have a lovely family.

Yes, I have.

Do you have children?

No.

A fine young lady like you

will have a prince real soon.

Unfortunately, he's old enough
to be my grandfather.

Are... are you those people

who come to build the shopping center?

No, I'm happy to say.

No. No, I'm not.

It's a shame about Noah.

You know Mr. Dearborn?

My.

Some say when god comes down

to vacation on earth,

he stays at Noah's.

That's why people keep him such a secret.

He's the prince you're referring to.

I saw you riding with him in town.

It's nothing to be
embarrassed about, my dear.

My, you won't be the first

to fall under his spell.

It's been happening longer
than you can imagine.

I'm sure you're right.

I feel sorry for those city people.

Why is that?

If they uproot Noah,

they're flirting with Providence.

Most people are at odds

about this new shopping center.

Some families are even split up over it.

They say it will bring more jobs,

more...

How you say it...

Revenue?

Well, they can go piss off.

This town is just fine

the way it is.

Get a blanket, Noah.

All right.

Here.

Mother.

Mom.

Mom.

You'll be all right.

Silas.

Just pass your plate right over here.

Can I speak to Christian Nelson, please?

Well, where is he?

What do you mean,
he's breaking ground today?

That's good.
Hold it right there.

Good, good, good.
Now down.

My god.

You all right?

You have to talk.

It's ok to be angry.

Don't let this get to you.

Christian is trying to force your hand.

He's trying to upset you.

The important thing is to remember

that you didn't do anything.

I'm not selling my land.

I know.

Believe me, I know.

This is my home.

Used to be nice.

Now...

It's terrible.

It's noisy.

I got work to do,

but I can't seem to do it.

I can't think with all this.

You have to trust me.

I'll be right back.

That's it. Good.

Tony, I want you to bring the rig on in.

Hey, Valerie.

What are you doing?

What's it look like we're doing?

You can't force him off his property.

I... i do feel terrible about this.

It's just that we have to break ground

or else all my investors
are going to back out on me.

Investors?

Yeah.

He doesn't want your money.

You're a real son of a bitch,

you know that?

You have no character.

You have no idea what's real.

You never have.

Because I was doing this for us, ok?

I was doing this for our relationship.

I make my living consoling people

I promise you, I'll have no trouble

finding my way out of this one.

I think you're making a...

I think you're making a big mistake!

Hey, what's she doing?

Is anybody hurt?

I didn't see anybody behind me.

Get her out!
Get her out!

Come on, pull.
Pull! Come on!

It's stuck.

Open the other side.

Come on, help me... on 3.

1, 2...

It's no use.

Quick, get out of the way.

It's me.

Ok.

Ok.

There we go. Easy.
You got her neck there?

You're going to be ok.

Thanks, Mr. Dearborn.

You didn't come a minute too soon.

It's ok to be angry.

It's ok...

To be angry.

I'm not going to be able to set this

if you don't hold still.

It's making it worse..

Stop that.

Hi.

Well, hello.

Noah said you got hurt
trying to help him.

I did.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, too...

No, no. It takes
more than a few days

to understand Noah, you know.

I've been breaking furniture for 20 years

just to get him to come and visit me.

Here.

Thank you.

You're welcome.
Thanks.

What you making?

A sweater.

It... it's for my mom.

It's pretty.

Thank you.
Do you knit?

Yeah, I do.

So, how much longer

did they say you had to stay here?

Well, tomorrow, I get my walking cast,

and then I can go.

That's good.

These are incredible.

Thank you.

I'm glad you like them.

Excuse me, but there's
a gentleman here to see you.

I didn't come to draw a long bow.

I hope you get better...

Real soon.

Thank you.

I read those books.

I like one.

Didn't care much for heathcliff, though.

Having a hunger for some of your pies.

Well, I got some ready for the oven,

but nothing's broken.

That's fine.

As long as you could use the visit.

Of course I could.

I'll wait outside for you.

I still don't like hospitals.

Noah...

I never liked hospitals, either.

Ok.

Take care of yourself.

You need anything, you call me.

I'll see you when you get out, now.

Ok. Thank you.
Bye.

I hope you heal well.

Good morning.

Good morning.

Good morning, young lady.

Good news.

Christian and his company

they've decided to move on
to a new location.

They're not coming back.

That's mighty nice to hear.

I hope you don't mind.

I brought you something.

It's a surprise.

Come on.

It doesn't have a name.

He will before sundown.

My goodness sake.

That's a little fella.
