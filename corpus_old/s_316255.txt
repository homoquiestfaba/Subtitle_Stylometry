Where you been?

hospital, helping carmela.

-the devotion that kid shows.

I just think of
My marie, the kids,

In that situation,
God forbid.

My ma--

who the fuck would take care of her
Something happens?

Except sil and you guys.

Colombians knock off
At noon.

<i>then it's empty.</i>

Managers unit's down a flight.

¡cuidado! ¡que alguien viene!

who's in there?
open it.

¡no dispares, soy yo!

What the fuck?

Get back!

shoot the prick.
get the fuck out
Of the way.

Cocksucking miserable
Spic shit!

It's supposed to be
Empty here daytimes.

jesus, my fucking balls!

The money!

Fuck, my fucking balls.

oogatz here.
the freeze.

Nothing.

Come on, let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise
We made.

Fuck that.

close the goddamn door.

This fucking shit
For a lousy two g's?

Oh, anthony.

hi, uncle bobby.
hiya, sweetheart.

Cugin'.

I'm gonna go ahead.

What's up?

You were at south mountain
Arena yesterday

Trying to buy a gun
From that asshole
In the snack shop.

who told you that?

we know how you feel,
But you can't do this.

I can't believe you
Know this.  Who told
You this?

Look, if my pops was
Laying in there shot up

i'd be thinking
The same thing.
but you can't go there.

Yeah, why the fuck not?

<i>listen to me,
I'm your uncle.</i>

Junior's in federal lock-up.
No one's getting to him there.

Well, it's difficult,
But not impossible.

Trust me.
Your dad does not want
You to get involved.

You gotta channel
That rage elsewheres.
Golden gloves.

what?
dumbbells or something.

Fuck your girlfriend more.

You little hothead here.

Did you park in emergency
Or in the garage?

What's going on
In there?

They're on rounds
Or something, dr. Plepler
And the indian girl.

Hi, did you bring me
My sweater?

Your sweater?

Man, jesus, fuck!

All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?

My problem is i'm
Old enough to sit
With dad all night,

Be a messenger boy,
Bring shit from
The house,

but i'm too young to deal
With the larger issues?

what are you talking about?

Like you didn't
Put them up to it.

Put who up to what?

God, he was in such
A good mood this morning.

I told the nurse  that i thought he
Moved his eyebrows  at around 5:30.

Did she pass that along?
'Cause if not, i'm gonna
Be furious.

Mrs. Soprano, you're really
Gonna have to recalibrate

Your expectations
At this point.

We can't even maintain
His blood pressure
At a level that we'd like.

Until his fever dissipates
And his white cell
Count comes down,

We're a long way
From home.

But he's really
Fighting.

Mom, he's really strong.

That is true.

Hi, dad.

<i>monastery?</i>

I received these
This morning.

Do i really look
That much like this guy?

To a certain extent,
All caucasians look alike.

Look,
I'm not finnerty.

I didn't sell you
This heating equipment.

But i am kind of
Worried about what
I might have done.

Because you see,
Yesterday--

Yes, tell us,
There's no fraud
Without a fairy tale.

Yesterday, i was diagnosed
With alzheimer's.

oh, my.

And i'm in this
Strange city and--

Please come inside.

I came here because
I thought

You could help
Me reach finnerty.

I have his wallet.
I have his briefcase,
But i'm not him.

Excuse the brothers
For laughing.

One day we will
All die,

And then we'll be
The same as that tree.

No me, no you.

Be that as it may,
We need heat.

We need to find someone who will
Take responsibility.

Well, i can't do that.

Then the lawsuit
Proceeds.

Hey, go home
And i'll stay.

I just had chinese food.

 carmela?

 dr. Melfi, hi.
How are you?

How  are you is
More the point.

I'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed
To get coffee,

Or tell the maid to.
It's the one thing
I have to have.

I got your note.
It was so thoughtful.

I've been calling
The hospital

 and they say that
Anthony's stabilized.

that's what they say.

If you or anyone
Needs anything,

To talk or to run
Interference with
The doctors,

<i>- don't hesitate to call.</i>

i appreciate that.
Thank you.

I have plenty of people
Around i can talk to.

Of course.

Good luck.

morning, gab. Is he ready?

he's eating.

We're picking up
Mrs. S. At 10:00.

I saw her tuesday.
How's she holding up,
Poor thing?

Not so hotso, really.

coffee?
yeah, thanks.

You hear about the thing
In the old neighborhood?

I'm not busy enough
For all this?

Couple of guys left three
On the floor in some
Colombian laundry.

Two guys we know,
Huh?

Total bloodbath.

Somebody said
A million plus.

What a score.

Fuckin' a.

<i>sil, benny
 says you have to go.</i>

yeah, all right.

Listen, don't forget...

Oh, honey,
Your asthma kicking up?

Springtime. Pollen's out of control.

i am so proud of you.

acting boss.
I hoped the day
Would never come.

You've always
Sold yourself short.

You know, that's
Not what i mean.
You know me.

All i ever wanted
Was to carve out
A little piece,

Enjoy some grandkids.

But how many guys
Could step into
Tony's shoes

and do the job
You're doing?
you think?

You have such strength
In crisis.

Benny told me
He feels honored
To drive you.

You're firm about
What you want without
Being obnoxious about it.

Sil, have you asked
Yourself what happens

If, god forbid,
Tony soprano doesn't
Recover?

Listen, gab,
I never talk to you
About my work.

And?

I'm gonna tell you something
I never told anybody.

Back when jackie
Was at the end,

He floated the idea
Of me stepping up
To the big seat.

Not tony, me.

really?

yeah, but i thought...
It's not for me.

still, you wouldn't
Sneeze at it.

I never saw myself
As that kind of guy.

I'm more behind
The scenes--

Advice,

Strategy.

But here you are, sil.

The times make
The man, honey,

Not the other way
Around.

asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's ancillary--

No change with tony.

Carmela's in
Goddamn pieces.

Memo-- get some coffee
Up to carmela's house.

Sil, bobby was making
Collections up in roseville
Again last night.

My time is limited.
Get him over and let's
Resolve this.

how's the skip doing?
same.

You forget something,
Like my cut?

You believe this guy?
You should've lost some
Weight in that nose,

Keep it out
Of everybody's business.
I'm working on it.

It's these fucking
Flowers right here.

Get this shit out
Of here.

That was junior's
Neighborhood, so now
It's mine.

Keep your voice down here.

<i>  a va'napola--.</i>

it was eugene's  going on three
Years. And eugene was with me.

you should have never had it to begin
With, except for the beef with
The tasty freeze route.

Junior ruled on it,
And it wasn't right then.

This fucking guy.

Easy.

how much
We talking about?
three g's a week.

Maybe that's what that miserab'
Admitted to you. I heard five.

you heard wrong.

What do we
Do here, sil?

here's the thing.

What, skip?

For the time being,
It's bobby's.

But he's still gonna
Kick up to you 20%.

how long's
For the time being?
yeah, sil.

What, do you
Speak norwegian?

For now.  We'll see
How much is there.

Hi, everyone.
My god, you poor thing.

Hey,  we just need
Some irish spring.

Good morning.

Another one?

know what i
Found out yesterday?
what's that?

I was diagnosed
Actually...

With alzheimer's.

Man,  i'm sorry
To hear that.

My uncle has
Memory loss.

Maybe it's hereditary.

Someone's probably
Studying that.

Is it possible

That i am kevin finnerty?

All right, i'll stop.

sil.

what?

You heard about this
Oran street takedown?

<i>the colombians?
That you?</i>

My guy had the tip.

Should be a nice
Chunk for everybody.

<i>everybody?</i>

Carmela,
She gets t's cut under
The circumstances, correct?

<i>it's your call.</i>

I know it's
My fucking call.

Yes, that is
The correct thing.

Oh, ladies' room's
Next door.

I can reach it
From here.

Grim fucking scene,
That i.c.u.

<i>she's one brave lady.</i>

I was just saying,
I'm gonna get t's piece
Of my half to sil for her.

of the thing.

back up there, bruto.

Your half?  I did
All the heavy lifting.

You would never have
Heard about it without
My information.

Big help.
It was fucking mayhem.

You said the place
Was empty.

Doc says i need
An ultrasound on
My groin and balls.

Sil, you wanna
Weigh in here?

It breaks
Half and half.

You both kick tony's
To me to deal with.

I'll have it for you
Sil, the whole 80k.

Ho, ho, ho, 80k?
How's that 20%
Of a million?

Have a cookie,
You're delirious.
It was 750, tops.

Fuck it all, paulie.
Tommy cased that shithole.

<i>what's with the fucking
Accounting out there?</i>

<i>that's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?</i>

<i>we're looking
After carmela.</i>

no question.
of course.

Sooner than later,
Paulie.

I gotta piss first.
You want half
Of that, too?

<i>j.t.:
In a prior incarnation,
I would get my load on,</i>

Blow 20 residuals
At the track.

As writers,

We are all hung up.

But we are also
Hung up

On our own hang-up.

We mythologize
Our inner narrative.

Take for example,
"beowulf."

Who is grendel,

But the habit,
The disease.

Ah, fresh casualties
In the battle
Of the blank page.

Welcome to the writer's guild.
Have a seat.

Take me...

My past as an addict.

Get the fuck up!
Come on!

Give me that
Fucking fisheye.

I'm offering you
A way to wipe your
Fucking obligation.

Wasn't  me who told you
To start gambling again.

I can't write a feature now.

I just landed a staff job.

People are seeing
Huge profits with these
Digital horror movies.

Douchebags who never
Made a film before.

That  "saw" thing,
400 grand to make,

Took in 100 mil
Worldwide.

I'm 100% well.

I deliver this script,
I owe you nothing?

You hear this dude?
100% well.

He's a bad boy, huh,
With that lingo?

Real fucking
Dark character.

My idea is "saw" meets
"godfather 2."

Proven track record--
Both genres.

Young wiseguy, assassin,
Gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him.

Leave his body parts
In dumpsters all

Around the city.
Long story short,

He is put back together by science,
Or maybe it's supernatural.

And he gets fucking
Payback on everyone
Who fucked him over,

Including the cunt
He was engaged to.

She was getting porked
By his boss the night
The hero was killed.

We'll have a meeting
Tomorrow.

We hear what you've fleshed
Out before we go to script.

Bing, 2:30.
Don't make me
Come look for you.

An entire room

Full of writers,

And you did nothing!

Sir, it's family only
In the unit.

I'll be out of your hair
In a minute, sister.

I keep telling you people,
I'm gonna have to call
The hospital administrator.

I wanted to let you know
There's a major package
Coming your way

From paulie and vito,
Very significant.

You all have done
So much already.

We just found out
Insurance won't pay
For physical therapy.

Bastards.
So thank you.

You wanna come in,
Say hello?

Uh, sure.

hello, father.

silvio.

I have napoleons,
But i also got fruit
For a certain party.

Either's good.

The program says
Sugar after meals
tells the body you're full.

when you married my cousin,

Everybody used to say you
Looked like john travolta.

He's almost back
To his white suit.

The bacala question.
Bobby don't have
Any claim.

I don't know why sil ruled so
Half-assed on you.
It's not my style.

he's worried more about taking
Care of carmela than the actual
Fucking earners.

please.
With johnny awaiting trial

And the feds
Freezing his assets,

Who do you think's
Keeping ginny in
Butter brickle?

Lucky for me,
Those last years
I was in the can,

My kid brother billy
Took care of patty
And the grandkids.

Only to have that
Motherfucking animal
Blundetto--

Don't do it
To yourself, philly.

It's hard to forget.

I don't forget.

I forget what
We were talking about.

Me too.
What the fuck was it?

Carmela.
The thing is--

You want coffee, coz?

If you're already
Making it.

Hot water
And lemon, hon.

H onestly...

How can i short carmela?

Maybe i'm not
Following you.

I'm as supportive
As the next guy,
But there's a point.

And what if tony
Takes a turn
For the worse?

I'm gonna hand her
$100,000,

And he dies
The next day?

Be money
Down the drain.

It's tempting,
But you can't think
That way.

<i>you all set now?</i>

Yeah, i'm living
It up here.

You  still stewing
About that money?

Spend some,
You'll get over it.

I'll never get over it.

Certain people--
Let me tell you.

Oh, come on,
Not sil again.

Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.

But i still gotta pay
Tribute to the princess
Of little italy.

the boss' wife.
What are you gonna do?

fuck her.

I'm on my way in now.

Yeah, good, and you might
Want to take care of that
Thing we talked about.

which thing?

<i>- that big piece of pie you
 were bringing to the hospital.</i>

she's expecting you,
So make it happen.

what are you worried about?

I think i know who
I'm fucking dealing
With here.

i resent that.

you have a problem
Taking orders from me?

Keep your shirt on.
It's done.

Don't get in bed
With him again.
You dislodged his drains.

That was my daughter.

And i can't help but think
That physical affection
Means something.

They refrigerate
This place, huh?

There you go.

<i>what are you still
Doing out there?</i>

I got involved
In a lawsuit.

<i>- a lawsuit?</i>

could create
Problems later.

<i>what kind of lawsuit?</i>

also...

<i>- what?</i>

I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.

<i>oh my god!</i>

The doctor said...

<i>what d he say?</i>

"mild concussion,"
He said.

Told me i'd be okay.

<i>that's it.
I'm coming out there.</i>

<i>my mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.</i>

No, don't do that.

<i>are you telling
Me everything?</i>

J.t., i want
To introduce you

To carmine lupertazzi
My co-executive
Producer on the project.

Nice to finally meet.

I heard tidbits of what
Chris has got in mind--
The genre and so forth.

But, j.t.,
I gotta warn you,

I'm very hands-on.
I learned that
The hard way.

I wanna welcome all
Of you to the first
Meeting

Of possible investors
On this project.

Some of you know
I've had nine pictures
Under my subspecies,

Four in the "south beach
Strumpet" series alone,

Each with 30,000-plus
Dvds in print.

That being said,
I usually find it
Helpful at this stage

To include my
Prospective partners
And get your inputs

Or notes as we call them.

J.t., you're on.

We've been working on a new
Kind of slasher film.

It takes place
In the world of...

You know...

Um, the mafia.

It's about
A wiseguy with a big mouth

And bigger dreams.

Anyway, they call him
"the butcher."

no, they don't.
why the fuck not?

Need i remind you
Of a certain butcher
Out of a.c.?

Right.

Not "butcher."
Go on, j.t.

So, right.

He's kind of
Outshining his boss.

So the guy has him clipped,
But he's still alive

When they cut him up.

He's gonna feel
That the next day.

Right.

So at the dump,

His body
Reassembles itself,

All except for
A hand that got crushed.

So he ties a cleaver

Onto the stump

<i>and he goes out
To get revenge
On everyone,</i>

Especially the boss, which
Is a pretty solid role.

Right now it's called
"pork store killer."

But i'm thinking...

Just...

"cleaver."

I'm confused.
You said he's dead.

How's he evening
Up with anybody?
He's a ghost?

As i understood,
A zombie of sorts.

Great title,
By the way.

<i>but if they jointed him,</i>

He's not gonna end up
All in the same dump.

and how's that
A slasher film?
what are you talking about?

A slasher.
A couple of kids
Naked in a lake.

Certified maniac
On the loose,
Not a ghost.

Actually, the maniac
Is almost always
A supernatural force.

Freddy, jason, michael myers
From "halloween."

Get the fuck out.

Easy, sil, easy.
He's making a point.

Michael myers is
An escaped mental patient.

Jason and freddy,
Different kind of movie.

Well, that's the kind
We're doing here.

"saw," "the ring"--
They made millions.

And that's not even
Including "the godfather"
Angle, which we got here.

<i>what if...</i>

They disposed him
At stops

That happened
To be along the same route?

Then he would all end up
In the same dump.

But he's a ghost?

I don't know.

"ghostbusters"--
Another fucking
Money machine.

Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.

Again.

It's got bechamel  on it,
So five, six hours out of the
Fridge, tops.

Look at her.

That word "plucky,"
Is that what it means?

Only, when do i get
To spend some face time
With the skip?

Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.

<i>man on tv:
...in this mob family
Domestic shooting,</i>

Which some observers
Note carries the echoes

<i>of the death of soul great
Marvin gaye.</i>

<i>as 20-year-old anthony
Soprano jr. Himself</i>

Told our amy kean,

"growing up soprano,

<i>it's just plain weird."</i>

Carmela?

i swear to god,
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
what the fuck?

You made a fool of
Yourself and our family

On national
Fucking television?

I didn't even say
That shit.

They totally
Misquoted me.
holy shit.

Well, of course they did.
That's what they do.

Which is why i
And everybody else

Told you, "don't talk
To the press!"

You're the one
Who looked like
A total asshole.

Dragging me around like
I was five years old.

You are a cross to bear.
That's all you are.

To your father, to me,
To everybody.

Fuck this.
Fuck it all!

Jesus, mel, the hell's
Wrong with you?

What's wrong with me?

What's wrong with me?

Mom.

It had to happen.
She's fried.

You have any extra compensation
For what you've been going through?

Nah, part of the job.

Like they say,

With great power comes
Great responsibility.

You know, vito called me
"skip" the other day.

Really?

Slip of the tongue no doubt,

But i noticed
He didn't correct himself.

See?

If it did become
Permanent, your compensation
Might be...

don't go there.

Hi, gab.
I need sil for a second.

Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.

This better be
Important, bobby.

Got a new baby and two kids
In private school.

This arrangement
With vito is killing me.

It's 9:30 at night.

Bobby, i don't remember
What the fuck it was.

Roseville,
This temporary shit.
I need an answer already.

I'm going out of my
Fucking mind here.

I'm liable to do
Something drastic.

Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.

Mornings are better.

I'll come up
With a solution.

I don't want you
To worry about it.

I must have sounded odd
At the supermarket
The other day.

See, you're
Tony's therapist.

Whether
It's appropriate...

How can i help you?

It's about my son.

Both kids, really.

The situation

With the shooting.
I'm very worried
About them.

Sure.

It's a very
Serious problem,

You know, guns
In the home.

It's a societal concern.
Obviously, we learned
Our lesson too late.

I immediately removed
All the firearms
From the house

After the goings-on
At tony's uncle's.

Anyway, last night,

I was shrieking
At my son,

And i said something
Very cruel.

And especially since
He's been trying
So hard...

How are you doing?

You know,
I'm frazzled certainly,

But i am more
Worried about them.

They're not kids anymore.

When they were young,

There were certain things
We could tell them
About tony's life.

You know, lies.
We'll just call
Them what they were.

but now...
so the issue
Isn't just

Guns in the home.

Honestly, i think
About my son in front
Of those cameras,

Having to vouch
For all this.

<i>my daughter
And her friends.</i>

They have to face

All these years
Of facading.

They do or you do?

The minute i met tony,
I knew who that guy was.

On my second date,
He brought me and my
Mother each a dozen roses

And my father
A $200 power drill.

Not the typical story
Of young love.

And i don't know
If i loved him
In spite of it...

Or because of it.

Parents
Weren't like that.

And i knew,

Whether consciously or not,
I knew that behind
That power drill,

There was probably
Some guy with
A broken arm,

You know, or worse.

And you coped
With that, how?

I'd go to my priest,
And i would cry,

And say how bad i felt
About how my husband
Made his money,

But that was bullshit.

Because there are
Far bigger crooks
Than my husband.

But the kids...

They don't decide
Who they're born to.

So now what?

Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?

It's all out
In the open now,
The whole thing.

And them, they're not

<i>in grade school anymore.
They become...</i>

The longer they stay
With us...

Complicit.

Oh, god.

Putting aside the moral
And legal issues,

Clarity can't be
A bad thing.

Tony's second night
In the coma, i told
Him i loved him.

When was the last time
I said that?

Are you afraid you aren't
Going to feel that way

When he wakes up?

Anthony tells me things are
Better between you.

I can't breathe.

it's all right.
come here, honey.

Can't breathe.

it's all right.

Can't breathe.

It's okay, honey.

You're gonna be okay.

what's going on?
would you move
Your car, please, sir?

Sil, i didn't hear
From you.

Sil's on the canvas now.

Fucking 100% disaster.

Point is, tony goes,

Let's face it,

Somebody's gonna have to
Step into the breach.

I'm a young man.

Now without the weight,

I'm a healthy man

With longevity.

I hear sil
Is at st. Barnabas.

My god, what is
Happening to us
Around here?

Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.

Listen, sweetheart,

You're expecting
Something, and i can't
Get into specifics,

And tony wouldn't
Want me to,

But there are certain
People looking over our
Shoulders right now.

'S okay, vito.
I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.

Like you said, i got
Bigger worries,

Like this son of mine.

You gotta trust me
On this, hon.

Suspicions get raised
If we were to move it

To you at this moment.

I got this.

Your ma says
Now's our moment.

The main thing,
When people come
To sit with dad,

The doctors want
Positive talk.
it helps in his recovery.

got it.

Oof, madonn'
He looks terrible.

Uncle paulie,
You can't say stuff
Like that.

You have to
Stay positive.

Yeah, it's just nothing prepares
You for that.
Uncle paulie!

Only one person
At a time, please.

She's a ballbuster.

Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few
Minutes, okay?

Remember, stay positive.

I gotta wear a jock,
The doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.

Of course, it could
Be a lot worse, right?

They gave me
An ultrasound,
No rupture.

I mean, the good thing is
I hurt it doing a major piece
Of business.

<i>i saw a little action,
And the next thing,</i>

<i>i was at the urologist. </i>

Fucking guy tells me i can't expect
The same things from my body no more.

<i>i tell you, t,
First the eyes,
Then the teeth.</i>

Next you find out
You can't take pissing
For granted.

Some joke, huh?

When i was in the service,

I won the chin-ups cup
Three weeks in a row.

Fucking beautiful
Definition, too.

Guy asked me to model
For the boxing poster.

He was half a fag,

Didn't i?

That cut to her now.

Easy, that's
A fucking guilty move.

Tony's conscious.
You capisce?

Everybody and his mother was in there
Talking to him

When he was in that coma. Carmela.
Who knows what the fuck they said?

Maybe

He's expecting
That money.

He can't talk yet
Because of the tube

That was in his throat.
Maybe we should consider
Ourselves lucky there.

But we are very happy,
Aren't we?

Anthony, you had us
So worried.

I haven't been
To church that much
Since i quit playing bingo.

What, honey?

I'm dead, right?

No no, you're
In the hospital
With all of us.

In newark.

Mr. Soprano,
How are you today?

I'm dr. Vahapsideh.
I'm a neologist.

How's he doing,
Sweetheart?

I don't know if we're
Out of the woods yet,
But he's hanging in.

He just passed his
First simple mental
Acuity test, so...

Your strength,
That was the difference.

Oh, a little something
From us.

Help defray medical costs,
Rehabilitation.

Jesus, i don't know
What to say.

this is what we do, honey.
i'd want the same for my marie.

Or my ma.

We're here if you need anything.

Great fucking news, t.

See you're up
And around.

Best.

"sometimes i go about
In pity for myself,

<i>and all the while,</i>

<i>a great wind carries me
Across the sky.</i>

Ojibwe saying."

Indians, right?

Who put this up?

Listen, t,
Something i wanted
To talk to you about.

I'm gonna take another run
At the movie business.

I know

You haven't
Liked that in the past,

But i'm going about it
In a whole different way.

In fact,

I'm hoping you'll become an
Investor when you feel
A little better,

And i can explain
What we're doing.
It's pretty exciting.

We'll own the neg. That's what
They call it. It means negative.

I'm holding a large
Ownership position

Open for you.
I hope you approve.

Actually,

Frankly...,

All due respect,

I think you owe me this,

As i came to you
About adriana.

<i>you've got him up?
I know how it looks,</i>

But he should be upright
As much as possible.

i'm gonna leave
You two alone.

thanks for everything.

I don't know
How you do it.

That's gotta feel
Good, huh?

The simple things.
