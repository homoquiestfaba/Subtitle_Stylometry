<i>My name is Richard.</i>

<i>So what else do you need to know?</i>

<i>Stuff about my family or where I'm from?</i>

<i>None of that matters.</i>

<i>Not once you cross the ocean
and cut yourself loose...</i>

<i>...looking for something more beautlful,
something more exciting...</i>

<i>...and yes, I admit,
something more dangerous.</i>

<i>So after 18 hours in the back of an airplane...</i>

<i>...three dumb movies, two plastic meals,
six beers and absolutely no sleep...</i>

<i>...I finally touch down...</i>

<i>- Hey, you! How about you?
... in Bangkok.</i>

Do you want to go to the waterfall?
Floating market!

1,500. Cheap for you! Come on! Hey!

Hey! Do you need somewhere to stay?

I'll find my own place, thanks.
What you want, man?

<i>And this is it. Bangkok.</i>

<i>Good- time city.</i>

<i>Gateway to Southeast Asia.</i>

<i>Where dollars and Deutschmarks get turned
into counterfeit watches and genuine scars.</i>

Good time! Boy! Girl! Fucking!
No problem!

<i>- This is where the hungry come to feed.
You wanna drink snake blood?</i>

Wait a minute. Did you say snake blood?

Oh, yeah!

No, thanks.
What is wrong with snake blood?

I just... don't like the idea.
Maybe you're scared.

Afraid of something new.
I just don't like the idea.

Like every tourist!

You want it all be safe.

Just like America!

<i>So never refuse an invitation.</i>

<i>Never resist the unfamiliar.</i>

<i>Never fail to be polite.</i>

Gentlemen...

<i>...that was excellent.</i>

<i>And never outstay your welcome.</i>

<i>Just keep your mind open
and suck in the experience.</i>

<i>And If it hurts...</i>

<i>...it's probably worth it.</i>

Hey.

Good evening.
Hi.

Can I get a room, please?
Yes.

<i>(TV</i>

<i>The only downer is,
everyone's got the same idea.</i>

<i>We all travel thousands of miles...</i>

<i>...just to watch TVand check into somewhere
with all the comforts of home.</i>

<i>And you gotta ask yourself...</i>

<i>We'll have this place cleaned up
in a jiffy, so don't you worry!</i>

<i>...what is the point of that?</i>

<i>Bombs exploding)</i>

<i>- Et voilà!
Thank you.</i>

<i>Bonsoir.</i>

<i>Bonsoir.</i>

Good night.

<i>And as for travelling alone...</i>

<i>...fuck it!</i>

<i>If that's the way it has to be,
then that's the way it is.</i>

<i>Everybody happy?!</i>

Everybody having a good time, eh?

Fuck you! Fuck you!

<i>Please shut up, OK?</i>

<i>Bastard parasites!</i>

Viruses!

That's fuckin' great! Cancers!

Bastard cancers!

<i>Hé! Tu vas fermer ta putain de gueule?!</i>

<i>A big, chunky Charlie
that's eatin' up the whole fuckin' world!</i>

<i>Hey!</i>

<i>Hey, you!</i>

You got anything to smoke?
No, I don't have anything to smoke!

That's nae problem, pal, cos, er...

<i>...I've got loads of the fuckin' stuff.</i>

Do ya understand what I'm sayin'?

Yeah.

No, you don't.

No, you're right. I don't.

<i>Ahh, that's better!</i>

<i>Thanks.</i>

It was the beach. You understand?

The beach. It was too...

...beautiful. Too much input, too much...
sensation. I-I try to keep it under control...

<i>...but itjust keeps spilling out
and spilling out and spilling out.</i>

You see, erm...

...she's on an island.

And the island is... is perfect.

I mean... I mean, real perfection here.

I'm notjust talking about... "Oh, that's nice. "

It's the real fuckin' deal, OK?

It's perfect.

See, it's like a... a lagoon.

Ya know, a tidal... lagoon.

See, it's sealed in by cliffs.

Totally fuckin' secret, totally fuckin'...

...forbidden.

And nobody can ever, ever...

...ever, ever go there. Ever.

But a few people went...

<i>...once upon a time.</i>

Men and women with ideals.
You understand?

I'm notjust talking about the usual...
travellin' fuckin' wanks.

Do you believe in that place?

No.

But I guess you're gonna tell me
that I should, right?

It doesnae fuckin' matter
what I think any more.

It's up to you.

Ideals, eh?

We were just fuckin' parasites!

The big, chunky Charlie!

See, I-I was the one...

<i>...that was trying to find the cure.
Procurer of the cure.</i>

I said to them "You've got to leave. "

"You've got to leave this place. "

But they wouldnae listen.

No offence an' all, but...

...you're fucked in the head, right?

Here, Richard.

It's been nice knowin' you, man.

Yeah. You, too.

Be careful! Electric... Electricity!

<i>- Ma'am! Ma'am!
Chill, man!</i>

No worry!

Hey! Man.

There is a letter for you.

A what?

Letter on your door.

No fuckin' way!

Do you...

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>You hope...</i>

<i>...and you dream...</i>

<i>...but you never believe that
something's gonna happen for you.</i>

<i>Not like it does in the movies.</i>

<i>And when it actually does...</i>

<i>...you want it to feel different.</i>

<i>More visceral.</i>

<i>More real.</i>

<i>I was waiting for it to hit me.</i>

<i>But it just wouldn't happen.</i>

<i>The name of Mr Daffy Duck.</i>

Birthplace: Never Never Land.

Gonna fuck up all the paperwork.

<i>The police were pissed because he was
travelling under a false passport.</i>

Go ahead, sign the statement.

It's OK.

It just say he cut his wrists -
already dead when you found him.

<i>But they didn't ask me about the map, so...</i>

No problem.

<i>...I didn't tell 'em.</i>

You have a nice day.

Good luck!

Excuse me.

Look... I mean...

<i>...this island may not actually even exist.</i>

Even if it does, I don't know
if we can get there or not.

I just wondered if you wanted
to come with me.

That's all.

Hey! You wanna take a hike?

Uh... a-a trip, ajourney?

With y-your girlfriend and me?

I mean, the two of you and me. Together.

I-I'm talking about the secret isla...
Hi.

Hi.

I just feel like everyone tries
to do something different, but...

<i>...you always wind up doing the same thing.</i>

<i>I realised that I had absolutely no idea
of how I was gonna get there.</i>

<i>But Étienne...</i>

<i>I mean, I have to hand it
to the guy. He was great.</i>

<i>I mean, he organised
the whole thing - tickets...</i>

<i>...timetables, the whole damn trip.</i>

<i>Bangkok to Surat Thani.
Surat Thani to Na Thon.</i>

<i>Na Thon to Chaweng.</i>

<i>500 miles in 24 hours...</i>

<i>...at less than 400 baht.</i>

<i>Trust me, that's a very good deal.</i>

<i>We were headed for the great unknown.</i>

<i>But to get there, we had to follow
the regular tourist trail.</i>

<i># A little less pushin'
and shovin'</i>

<i># Take it easy</i>

<i># You could even get sleazy</i>

<i># Come around</i>

<i># Watch a movie</i>

<i># With the sound down</i>

<i># And get woozy...</i>

It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. 1800 baht.

Ah, great man! Nice work!

There is one problem.
He will not take us to the island.

It's in the national park
and it's forbidden to go there. But...

<i>...we are allowed to travel to this one
to stay for one night.</i>

Yeah... No, see, that's the wrong one.

Yeah, I know that.

Right. But how do we get
from there to there?

We swim.
We swim?

Yeah. We leave our rucksacks
on this island and then we swim.

You can swim, can't you, Richard?
Of course I can swim.

So no problem.
So h-how far is it, though?

I don't know. One or two kilometres.

Cool. Cool... Not far at all
Stop it, Richard. It will be worth it.

An adventure. And just... the three of us.

Uh-oh.

<i>"Can you swim?"</i>

"I can swim! Oh, yeah! I am French and
I have the beautiful girlfriend, too! Huh!"

Great

<i>- Goddammit!
Locked out, huh?</i>

Yeah.

<i>- Lost your key?
Uh-huh.</i>

<i>- Bummer!
Yeah, bummer!</i>

So, uh... you wanna
grab a beer or somethin'?

You're better off without her.
Sammy, how the fuck would you know?!

You've never even met her!

I'm just tryin' to help the guy
through the dark times.

It's not a problem.
You see, Zeph?

It's not a problem.
Change the fuckin' subject.

All right. Let's talk about how you spend
an hour in front of the mirror every day.

<i>Oh, that's nice You know this guy?
He likes to wipe his ass with tree leaves.</i>

He thinks he's some sort of
jungle commando.

<i>- Whatever.
I swear to God!</i>

<i>- Whatever.
Damn!</i>

I presume...

<i>...you know the story
of the Kentucky fried mouse.</i>

Yeah.

Woman bites into a chicken leg...

<i>...and it turns out to be, uh... a mouse.</i>

Right?

It's an urban myth.

Exactly. It always happened
to a friend of a friend of someone else.

So?
So...

<i>...I guess there's this urban myth
goin' around here at the moment.</i>

It's about a beach.

Yeah?
Uh-huh.

And this beach is... perfect, man.

It's on an island, right?

Hidden from the sea.

Now, imagine. You got...

<i>...pure white sand.</i>

Crystal-clear water.

<i>- Palm trees.
Yeah, with coconuts and shit!</i>

Yo, tell him the best part, dawg.

Plus...

...enough dope, Richard...

<i>...to smoke all day, every day...</i>

<i>- ... for the rest of your goddamn life!
Yeah! Mad weed!</i>

<i>Only a few people know exactly where
it is, and they keep it absolutely secret.</i>

No one's actually ever met
any of these people.

Exactly. It's a Kentucky fried mouse!

Hm!

Although, if I had a key to a place like that...

<i>...I'd keep it to myself cos... you don't want
every fuckin' asshole in Thailand...</i>

...turnin' up! Boo-boo!

<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

So whaddaya think
about that story, Richard?

It's good.

It's a good story.

Hey, you! I got your key!

<i>Now, I know it wasn't a part of the plan...</i>

<i>...but I made a decision
to leave a copy of the map.</i>

<i>I'm not gonna say it was
the best decision I ever made.</i>

<i>I told myself that spreading news
is a part of a traveller's nature.</i>

<i>But If I was being completely honest...</i>

<i>...I was just like everybody else:</i>

<i>...shit-scared of the great unknown.</i>

<i>Desperate to take
a little piece of home with me.</i>

<i>- Richard?
Are you ready?</i>

Yeah, yeah. I'm coming.

Let's go.

<i># Feel dead</i>

<i># Feel dead</i>

<i># Feel dead</i>

<i># Feel dead</i>

<i># Happy</i>

Françoise?

<i>Chut! Étienne will be angry if I wake him.</i>

He thinks I waste time,
taking photographs of the sky.

Oh...

I think so, too.
Yeah?

Have a look.

One night, I will get the perfect photograph.

Hi!

Whoa!

You realise that...

<i>...in the eternity of space...</i>

...there's probably a planet out there, right...

<i>...just like this one...</i>

...where another you...

<i>...is photographing back down towards us.</i>

I mean, essentially, you are photographing
yourself in a parallel universe.

Incredible.

Yeah...

There are infinite worlds out there, ya know?

Where anything you want to happen...

<i>...does happen.</i>

Richard, do you know something?

Hm?

This is just the kind of pretentious bullshit...

...Americans always say to French girls...
so they can sleep with them.

God! Sorry.

I thought I was doin' pretty good.

It's just the sky, Richard. Let's try.

Yeah.

<i>Idiot.</i>

<i>Un, deux, trois...</i>

<i>...quatre.</i>

<i>When you develop
an infatuation for someone...</i>

<i>...you always find a reason to believe
that this is exactly the person for you.</i>

<i>It doesn't need to be a good reason.</i>

<i>Taking photographs of the night sky,
for example.</i>

<i>Now, in the long run...</i>

<i>...that's just the kind of dumb, irritating habit
that would cause you to split up.</i>

<i>But in the haze of infatuation...</i>

<i>...it's just what you've been searching for
all these years.</i>

<i>- One kilometre.
Two.</i>

<i>- Richard?
I don't know. I'm American.</i>

So?
We think in miles, not kilometres.

OK. So how many miles do you think it is?

I don't know.
But it looks like a long way away.

If it's too far, we're gonna drown.

But if we don't try,
we'll never know, right?

Right.

So let's go!

<i>Whoo!</i>

<i>- Are you guys all right?
Yeah, we're OK.</i>

I think we're about halfway.

Oh, fuck! Richard!

<i>- Fuck!
What?</i>

I saw a fin!

<i>- Tsk! What? Are you joking?
No, no, no!</i>

A fin!

OK, a shark fin?

I don't know. Just a fin.
Over there, about 100 metres.

Well, was it big?
Yes.

What the fuck do you expect me
to do about it?!

Nothing! I just thought you should know.

To be honest, I'd rather you hadn't told me!

OK, I'm sorry.
Well, it's a bit fuckin' late now, isn't it?!

Françoise! Françoise! She's gone!

Oh, my God!

<i>- Oh, my God! OK, what happened?
She just went under the water!</i>

She was pulled under!

<i>Françoise!</i>

Françoise! I don't see her!

Oh, fuck! It's her bag!

OK. Was there a shark?
Did you see a shark, Étienne?

I don't know!

Fuck!

Don't fuck me!

<i>Fuck you!</i>

Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Oh, you Europeans, you're so funny

You have such a playful sense of humour

No wonder your comedy
has conquered the world

What about Molière?
Who?

Oh, fuck off!

<i>- Agh!
Come on.</i>

<i>Wow!</i>

Now, this is what I call a lot of dope!

<i>Oh, putain!</i>

<i>T'as du papier à rouler?</i>

Hey! Tch, tch, tch!

OK... OK...

<i>We're gonna go this way.
OK? Shut up. Shut up.</i>

Argh! Agh!

Aï!

<i>Sure, we should've turned back.</i>

<i>But I wasn't going to.</i>

<i>Not now.</i>

<i>I just kept telling them we'd get there.</i>

<i>"Trust me...</i>

<i>...it's paradise. "</i>

If we take this down,
it should lead us all the way.

Come on!

<i>Oh, God!</i>

<i>Putain de merde!</i>

<i>Well?</i>

<i>- Well what?
How do we get down?</i>

How am I supposed to know?
Do I have to decide everything?

We'll jump.
Fuck! You wanted to be in command!

I only took command because
you lost your nerve, French boy!

Yeah. And look where you've taken us!

We'll jump.
If you're not happy...

<i>...you can just take over. All right, sir?!</i>

<i>All right, I will.</i>

There. We climb down there.
We can jump.

Françoise! Look... We're not gonnajump!

All right? So just can it!
And as for climbing down there...

<i>...that is just...</i>

<i>...an asshole suggestion!</i>

Calling me an asshole?
Yeah. And that's just the start of it.

All right, fuckface, let's do it!
Motherfucker!

<i>Françoise!</i>

Shit!
Françoise!

Come on, guys! It's OK!

It's not dangerous! Come on!

Drop the bags down! Come on!

All right. So we'll jump.

Oh, fuck!

<i>Whoa!</i>

Whoo-hoo!

Did you see that? Shit!

Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

Yes!

Whoo-hoo!

<i>Oh, my God!</i>

Congratulations!

Took me the best part of an hour
to work up the balls to do that.

Mind you, I was on my own, so you have to
make allowances. Ya know what I mean?

I think maybe you'd better meet up with Sal.

Jesus Christ! We're fuckin' here!

Do ya realise that?

Don't you go anywhere!

All right.

You're doin' well.

<i>- Ciao! Sonja! ¿A que sí?
Hi.</i>

<i>Noisy kitchen!</i>

How are ya doin'?

What's for dinner?
One guess. Fish.

<i>I don't know what we expected.</i>

<i>People living in a cave,
maybe even a few guys in tents.</i>

Gregorio!

<i>But nothing like this.</i>

How are you, Keaty?
Don't smoke 'em!

<i>It was like we arrived into a lost world.</i>

<i>A full-scale community of travellers - not just
passing through, but actually living here.</i>

<i>I suddenly became aware...</i>

<i>...that we weren't even invited.</i>

<i>- The guy who drew it?
Daffy.</i>

Yeah... Yeah. He's dead.

<i>What? No way!</i>

Yeah. He cut his wrists open
in a hotel room on the Khao San Road.

You have seen this?!
Well, I came afterwards.

Well, that's sad news.

He was... one of the founders
of our community.

Oh.

But he became depressed.

<i>Crazy.</i>

The police didn't know what to do with
the body, so I guess they'll incinerate him.

Do you think he gave a map to anybody else?

I- I... No, I don't think so.

And you. Have you
shown this map to anybody?

No.

No.

No.

Good.

We value our secrecy.

<i>- Yeah!
Whoo!</i>

You hear that? You hear that?

Look at this guy.

<i>Oh, c'est magnffique.</i>

Oh, it's so fucking beautiful, man!

Neighbours!
Hey! I've got your oils, man.

I want to give you something.

<i>Listen up, everybody.</i>

OK.

Tomorrow, I will travel
for many miles on a bicycle.

Um...

Vicki.

Uh... Uh...

<i>Uh... Sutra cu putovati...</i>

<i>...mnogo milja biciklom.</i>

Great! Very good. Hélène?

Very good!

<i>Sutra cu putovati... mnogo milja biciklom.</i>

<i>Very good.</i>

Right. It's far too easy, though.

<i>- Oh, please!
Yes! OK.</i>

<i>Sutra cu putovati mnogo
milja biciklom. Da posetim svoju tatu...</i>

<i>...koji cuva koze na planini.
There's more, ya know!</i>

<i>- You always know everything!
Richard!</i>

<i>Sutra...</i>

<i>...cu...</i>

<i>...putovati...</i>

<i>...mnogo milja biciklom.</i>

<i>Yes! Richard!</i>

Represented, man!

<i>Sutra cu putovati
mnogo milja biciklom.</i>

<i>This became our world.</i>

<i>And these people, our family.</i>

<i>Back home was just one more place
we didn't think about.</i>

<i>I settled in.</i>

<i>I found my vocation:</i>

<i>...the pursuit...</i>

<i>...of pleasure.</i>

<i>Sal was the leader.</i>

<i>But it wasn't a big deal. I mean,
there wasn't any ideology or shit like that.</i>

<i>It was just a beach resort...
for people who don't like beach resorts.</i>

<i>...some of us build.</i>

Even paradise takes a little shaping.

<i>For years, they kept this place a secret.</i>

<i>They didn't need to tell anyone.
They were practically self-sufficient.</i>

<i>They just had to sail back once in a while
to trade a little marijuana and buy some rice.</i>

We grow our own, so no stealing
from the farmers on the other side.

And do they know that you're living here?

Oh, yeah. But they keep to their side
and we don't trespass on their turf.

A couple of years ago, they said that we
could stay, but nobody else should come.

Which kind of suits us as well.
So you was lucky, ya know.

Very lucky.

<i>There was Keaty, who only cared
about two things.</i>

Thank you, Lord...

<i>...for the twin pillars of civilisation:</i>

...Christianity...

<i>...and cricket.</i>

<i>There were the Swedes:</i>

<i>...Christo, Sten and Karl.</i>

We like fishing.

And in the winter, we like skiing.
Yeah!

Of course, in Thailand, there is no skiing.

<i>We wait, OK?</i>

We wait for the fish to come.

Get it?

<i>- Shit! No way!
Whoo!</i>

And I said to thee "I shall provide!"

Yeah!

Stop it.
What?

<i>Our resident chef was known as Unhygenix.</i>

Let's cook!

<i>On account of his obsession with soap.</i>

Fish, fish, fish!

Still I smell of fish!

<i>There was a range of sporting
and leisure activities to suit all tastes.</i>

Étienne is good at soccer.

Ya know, I could do that if I wanted to.

I just don't want to.
What are you talking about?

Making conversation.
Do you have a girlfriend?

Here?
Anywhere.

No. Why?

Just making conversation.

<i>Whoo!</i>

Right arm over wicket. Three balls remaining.
Is there anyone who still doesn't understand?

<i>The only person I didn't like was Sal's
boyfriend, Bugs - our on- island carpenter.</i>

Hey, Richard! Can you do this?

Can you make anything?

A man should have a talent in his hands.

<i>Here we go, people!</i>

Surprise!

<i>So every community has its rituals.</i>

<i>Well, ours was simple:
The last one to arrive tattoos the next.</i>

It fuckin' hurts, OK?

<i>What did he say?</i>

Agh!

Andy, bring yours closer.

<i>Come on, Richard!</i>

Ohhhh, God!

Ohh, God!

Ohh, Jesus!

<i>That fuckin' hurt!</i>

<i>All in all, this really was paradise.</i>

<i>Except for one thing.</i>

<i>Desire is desire...</i>

<i>...wherever you go.</i>

<i>The sun will not bleach it...</i>

<i>...nor the tide wash it away.</i>

Françoise.

One: She's just teasin' ya.

<i>What are you talking about?</i>

Two: You don't speak French.

Three: He speaks French.

In fact, even better than that, four:

<i>...he is French.</i>

Five: He's much better at football -
sorry, soccer - than you.

And six: You're a bit strange, Rich.

Some girls like that in a man, but not
the sort of girls you wanna be with.

Is that right?
Come on, your last girlfriend chucked ya.

It was not my fault!
And seven: Look at your thumbs, man!

They're well-defined.
What does that mean?

You play a lot of video games!

That is a powerful index of incompatibility.

Why do I get the feeling
you're trying to tell me something?

You haven't a hope - not a bleedin'
chicken's chance in Thailand.

Know what I mean?
Thank you.

So, enjoy the beach and cut the bullshit.

<i>- Thank you very much.
It's my pleasure!</i>

<i>No, you cannot... No!</i>

No! No, leave me!

<i>- Leave me!
Hey! That's my bed!</i>

I can deal with it!
I don't want you to deal with it!

<i>It won't take a minute.</i>

Really, no! No, I must go to mainland!

I'm sick. I've got to. Sal!

What's this? You want to go
to the mainland to see a dentist?

Yes.
It's out of the question.

Come on!

Lt'll be fun.

<i>Be brave.</i>

<i>How's it going, Richard?</i>

Fine. Fine.

Are you OK with this?
Yeah.

I mean, we have a secret here, right?

Sometimes people need to
take a little pain to keep it that way.

Excellent.

Excellent attitude.

No problem.

<i>Oh, shit!</i>

<i>Good work!</i>

<i>Kill the pain, boy.</i>

Take a drink.

<i>Richard.</i>

Yeah?

Would you like to come
to the beach with me?

Sure. Yeah.

Are you happy, Richard?

Happy?

Yeah.

Yeah... Yeah, I-I guess.

I mean, the beach, ya know, it's just perfect.

Do you think that I ignore you?

No.

But I do.

It's because I'm with Étienne.
It's difficult for me to spend time with you.

I don't suppose that there's any...
you know, special reason that you should.

Spend time with me, that is.
Of course there is.

I like you.

A lot.

Have you... Have you
told this to Étienne? Or...

No.

It's our secret.

OK.

Look! There! The plankfon. Shrimps.

When they're disturbed, they glow.

Come on!

<i># I'm coming, not drowning
Swimming closer to you</i>

<i># I'm moving</i>

<i># I feel it</i>

<i># I'm coming, not drowning</i>

<i># I'm moving, I feel it</i>

<i># I'm coming, not drowning</i>

<i># I'm moving, I'm coming</i>

<i># Can you hear what I hear?</i>

<i># It's calling you, my dear...</i>

<i>That night, we promised ourselves,
and we honestly believed...</i>

<i>...that no one would ever know.</i>

I wanna talk.
About what?

About you and Françoise.

Whaddaya mean... me and Françoise?

I mean, Richard...

... that I want her to be happy.
Yeah.

I mean, of course.

We all do, right?
Shut up!

Please shut the fuck up.

And if happy is with you...

<i>...then I will not stand in her way.</i>

Étienne, man, I...

I don't know what you're talking about.
Fuck you, Richard! I know!

OK? I know!

Everybody knows!

<i>The problem is seeing the fish.</i>

With the heavy rain and the bad light...

<i>...it's very difficult to catch them.</i>

It can last for days.

Sometimes...

<i>...we get really hungry.</i>

Gimme that.

Richard!

Richard! Richard!

Come out!

I can't hear you!

And you can't hear me.

Shark!
Come!

Shark!

Ohh!

<i>All right, all right.</i>

All right, all right, all right!

Shh!

Now before I start, there's just
a couple of things you have to remember.

Number one: You have to remain calm.

Right?

And number two: You have to show no fear.

Teach it, teach it.
Because the sharks...

You see, the sharks, they can sense that fear.

Just as easily as they can sense blood.

<i>And so it went for me.</i>

<i>Just as I knew it would.</i>

Just as nature had ordained.

Its... jaw wide open.

Row upon row of these razor-sharp teeth
glinting underwater like... jagged diamonds.

It's tail fin sweeping back and forth
as it surged in for the kill.

<i>I swear to God...</i>

<i>...my whole llfe
flashed before my eyes.</i>

<i>Really.</i>

I had nothing left to offer
except for pure reflex.

<i>Pure reflex...</i>

<i>...and mankind's basic drive for survival
that somehow...</i>

...shouts "No! I will not die today!"

Yes!
Whoo!

<i>At that instant, I knew
it was either the shark or me.</i>

<i>The shark knew it.</i>

<i>I knew it.</i>

But jeez... God!

It's nothin' personal, right? It's just
the way the world works. It's nature.

<i>But... If I remember correctly...</i>

<i>...in that last glimmer of its eyes...</i>

...there was a moment between us...

...where it said "Hey, Richard, man. "

Strange thing, killing a shark,
isn't it, Richard?

It's just a big fish, Bugs.

Just a big fish?

Yeah, maybe! Maybe when it's just a baby
and it hasn't really learned to kill yet.

Then maybe it's just a big fish.

But when it's a great white angry mother
with the taste of blood on its tongue...

<i>...now that's a different story.</i>

<i>Oh, God! Jeez...</i>

I'm sorry, Bugs. Is itjust me?

Or does this wet weather
make everyone so damn tired?

Maybe we can hear your very different
and, I'm sure, very interesting story...

<i>...some other time, huh?</i>

Very interesting, Keaty!

<i>Vrlo interesantno.</i>

<i>Molto interessante!</i>

<i>- Good night, young lovers.
Shut up!</i>

<i>For a while, we were untouchable
in our happiness.</i>

All right! Everybody!

<i>Quiet!</i>

We have a situation. It's not a disaster.
But as some of you may have heard...

<i>...a couple of sacks of rice have
become contaminated by a fungus.</i>

Yeah.
It's cos we keep it in that shack.

How many more times must this happen?
Rice run!
