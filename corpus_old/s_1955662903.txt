-Plenty of windows
  are out there.</font>


[baby crying]</font>

-Keenan doesn't have a snooze
       button, does he?</font>

-Um, yeah, actually.</font>

Right behind his left ear.</font>

Don't kill him, all right?</font>

-Oh, no.</font>

No, no.</font>

We're gonna make a sleeper
       out of him.</font>

OK.</font>

All right.</font>

-Well, I can't tell.</font>

No coffee for you.</font>

No coffee for you.</font>

Oh, you know what?</font>

You're gonna need gas.</font>

MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):

Doug wants to see you.</font>

-Hey, Craig.</font>

How you doing, buddy?</font>

Yeah, yeah.</font>

Good.</font>

How's everything?</font>

Audrey good?</font>

Listen, uh, we're downsizing
     a little bit, so--</font>

[slow music playing]</font>

CRAIG (ON PHONE): Hey, babe.</font>

I just wanted to let you know
I'm going to be a little late.</font>

I'm gonna go grab a drink
 with Enrique after work.</font>

So I'll see you tonight.</font>

Love you.</font>

Bye.</font>

-Oh, god.</font>

-Give me your money.</font>

-Oh, shit.</font>

-Give it all to me,
   Craig Daniels.</font>

-Lake--</font>


-Oh, Vince.</font>

Oh my god, man.</font>

You scared the shit out of me.</font>

-Well, you gotta watch
 your back, brother.</font>

How many times have
  I told you that?</font>

-Yeah, yeah.</font>

-Look at you, man.</font>

I haven't seen you
   in a minute.</font>

Hey, whatever you're drinking
       I'm buying, OK?</font>

-Thanks.</font>

No, actually I gotta
  get out of here.</font>

I gotta get home.</font>

-Are you kidding me?</font>

I haven't seen you
  in five years.</font>

I'm not letting you leave
     without a drink.</font>

-Really, five years?</font>

-Five years, man.</font>

One drink.</font>

-Yeah, OK.</font>

Yeah, I'll have another one.</font>

-Yeah, my man.</font>

Um, whatever he's having,
     and, uh, Jameson</font>

on the rocks, please.</font>

Wow.</font>

What the fuck are you
   doing here, man?</font>

I mean, you're obviously looking
      for trouble, right?</font>


-Oh my god.</font>

-Oh, yeah.</font>

-You're married?</font>

No way.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-You got kids too?</font>

-Yeah, I have a 15-month-old
            son.</font>

-Wow.</font>

-Want to see his picture?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

Yeah, show me the
  little bugger.</font>

-His name's Keenan.</font>

-Wow.</font>

Keenan, huh?</font>

I mean, he looks just like you.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

Same hairline.</font>


-And that's-- that's--
  that's your wife?</font>

-That's Audrey, yeah.</font>

-She's beautiful, man.</font>

-Thanks.</font>

-Congratulations.</font>

Busy five years, huh?</font>

-Yep.</font>

-So let me guess.</font>

You got a house up in Silver
 Lake, a couple of bulldogs</font>

running around.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-A little office where you
   do all your writing.</font>

You still writing?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-Wow.</font>

-So, um, you got any pictures
       in your wallet?</font>

-No, no.</font>

Not me.</font>

No.</font>

I got a couple pictures in my
phone, but you probably don't</font>

want to see those.</font>

Do you want to see those?</font>

-No.</font>


-Oh, fuck.</font>

I--</font>

I've been creeping on this thing
     over here for a little</font>

while, man.</font>

That's-- that's a dime, right?</font>

What do you think it takes
    to lock something</font>

like that up, huh?</font>

House in the hills and
a Mercedes, probably.</font>

-I wouldn't know.</font>

-No, you wouldn't.</font>

You're off the market
    for good now.</font>

One piece of ass for the
   rest of your life?</font>

You kidding me?</font>

-Yeah, when you're in it, you
don't even really think about</font>

it.</font>

-Not me.</font>

As soon as I get in it,
  I'm already thinking</font>

about the next one.</font>


-Oh--</font>

-So I see, uh, work's
  keeping you busy?</font>

-Oh--</font>

yeah.</font>

Yeah.</font>

-You paying the bills OK?</font>

-Yeah, I mean, I get by.</font>

You know.</font>

I'm--</font>

I'm not rich, but--</font>

-Let me ask you something.</font>

When you--</font>

when you go to collect
 money, right, like--</font>

how-- how's it go down?</font>

Like, how does that work?</font>

-What-- what do you mean?</font>

-Well, like, does it always
    have to get violent?</font>

Can you sometimes maybe
    talk to them, or</font>

like, intimidate them?</font>

I don't know.</font>

I'm asking.</font>

-You owe me some money, buddy.</font>

Remember?</font>

You have a gambling problem.</font>

Time to pay.</font>

Why-- no--</font>

I don't-- why you asking?</font>

-No, I'm just--</font>

-Are you, like, researching
    a book or something?</font>

What--</font>

-No, no.</font>

-What's going on?</font>

-I'm in trouble, man.</font>

-OK.</font>

-We got an eviction notice this
     morning, and, uh, if I</font>

don't pay in a few days, we're
   gonna be on the street.</font>

-Fuck.</font>

-I don't have a job since,
 like, an hour ago, so--</font>

-I'm sorry, man.</font>

Look, I--</font>

I can help you out.</font>

I got a couple hundred bucks.</font>

-Look, I need 4,500.</font>

-Yeah, that's-- that's a little
       rich for my blood.</font>

So that's-- that's why
    you're asking?</font>

You're looking for work?</font>

-Oh, no, no, no.</font>

No, just curious.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

You know, Craig, I once broke a
  guy's arm for $80 while his</font>

daughter watched.</font>

You think you're capable of
 doing something like that?</font>

God, don't get so heavy.</font>

-I'm not.</font>

I'm cool.</font>

-My god, you got so depressed
  over the last five years.</font>

-No, it's good.</font>

It's good.</font>

I, uh--</font>

I'm gonna go drain.</font>

-All right.</font>

-I'll be right back.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

Craig Daniels.</font>

Craig Daniels.</font>

God damn.</font>


-Sorry.</font>

What's up?</font>

-Hey Craig.</font>

These guys want to buy
 the next round, man.</font>

Come on, saddle up.</font>

They were just looking
for a little company.</font>

-Hey.</font>

Party, party.</font>

Cool.</font>

All right.</font>

You guys like tequila?</font>

-Um, yeah.</font>

Yeah, sure.</font>

-Bartender, three shots of your
    finest tequila, please.</font>

You know-- wait-- hold--</font>

I'm sorry.</font>

Uh, just, matter of fact, give
     me the whole bottle.</font>

And the cranberry juice.</font>

-Yeah?</font>

What are your names?</font>

-I'm Colin.</font>

This is my wife, Violet.</font>

-Hey, how you doing?</font>

I'm Vince.</font>

-Vince?</font>

All right.</font>

-Craig.</font>

-Craig.</font>

It's Violet's birthday today,
      so we thought we'd</font>

go out on the town.</font>

You know, get a little crazy.</font>

-Happy birthday.</font>

-Right?</font>

-Thanks.</font>

There she is.</font>

Put it right there.</font>

-You sure?</font>

This is a $300 bottle
     of tequila.</font>

-Oh, my.</font>

Oh, this is embarrassing.</font>

Uh--</font>

uh-- yeah, it's fine.</font>

What's your name?</font>

-Caren.</font>

-Caren with a K or a C?</font>

-C.</font>

-There you go, Caren with a C.</font>

-Thanks.</font>

-The glasses come with?</font>

Oh, good.</font>

Gentlemen.</font>

To my amazing wife, Violet.</font>

The past six months have been
     so fucking awesome.</font>

I love the shit out of you.</font>

-Love you too.</font>

-All right, to Violet.</font>

Oh.</font>

God damn.</font>

-That's smooth.</font>

-Yeah, it's all right.</font>

I have this bottle at home.</font>

It used to belong
 to Pancho Villa.</font>

It cost me, like,
  what, $10,000.</font>

-What?</font>

-Yeah, isn't that crazy?</font>

Uh, so anyway-- what do
 you guys-- what do you</font>

guys do for a living?</font>

Do you, like, uh, work at
 a car wash or something?</font>

-Oh, you mean because
 of the monkey suit?</font>

-Well, I didn't-- no offense.</font>

I assumed manager.</font>

-No, no, no.</font>

We're just old friends
     catching up,</font>

having a couple of drinks.</font>

-Right on.</font>

Old friends is good.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

No, we used to skateboard
        together.</font>

We played music in
   high school.</font>

-You guys go way deep.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

Yeah.</font>

No, simpler times.</font>

Yep.</font>

-Occasionally.</font>

-Mystery man.</font>

Occasionally.</font>

Ber.</font>

Bum.</font>

You should be wearing a suit
  and a tie or something.</font>

This guy-- ruh-ruh
   ruh-ruh-ruh.</font>

A very proper man.</font>

Oh, uh, Violet--</font>

we should, uh, take
   some candids.</font>

Take some-- take
 some pictures.</font>

We should document this, right?</font>

-OK--</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Come on.</font>

-All right, you want to
  take some pictures?</font>

OK.</font>

Yeah, sure.</font>

-Say cheese.</font>

-Cheese.</font>

Oh god, that's bright.</font>

Oh.</font>

-Let me get in there.</font>

-You want another one?</font>

OK.</font>

-Here we go.</font>

-One, two, three.</font>

-All right.</font>

Did you take it?</font>

How's it look?</font>

Ooh.</font>

Mm.</font>

Oh, here we go.</font>

-What?</font>

What's going on?</font>

-We got this little bet going.</font>

You see that old dude
     at the bar?</font>

Every time he checks out the
bartender's ass, Violet wins.</font>

Every time he checks out
    her tits, I win.</font>

Motherfucker.</font>

-Wait, wait.</font>

And that-- that's $100
  every single time?</font>

-Yeah, it's not, like, a serious
        bet or anything.</font>

-We have fun.</font>

-We have fun.</font>

I got an idea.</font>

Here we go.</font>

Idea man.</font>

All right, whichever of
  you fellas does this</font>

shot first gets $50.</font>

Boom.</font>

-$50?</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): $50.</font>

-Wait, what?</font>

-Oh.</font>

Wins.</font>

Meanwhile-- wait, what?</font>

Pay attention.</font>

Pay attention.</font>

-That was short-lived.</font>

Here you go, buddy.</font>

-What are you doing?</font>

No no, he didn't
even do a shot.</font>

-No, it's all right.</font>

He--</font>

-No, that's your money.</font>

-All right.</font>

I won't argue.</font>

-Gotta play by the
   rules, guys.</font>

That's the only way
    to have fun.</font>

Shot game.</font>

You are a misfit.</font>

What island are you from?</font>


-Ah--</font>

-There he is.</font>

Aww.</font>

Fuck you, we're not
    gonna start.</font>

One dart, face.</font>

-On his face?</font>

-$50.</font>

-All right.</font>

All right.</font>

Here it goes.</font>

Ready?</font>

-Oh!</font>

-Oh, come on!</font>

So close.</font>

-Oh my god.</font>

Hold on.</font>

Check her out.</font>

Check her out.</font>

There.</font>

-Who?</font>

-Black dress.</font>

-Oh god.</font>

No, that's-- that's a rough
 stretch woman right there.</font>

-Pfft.</font>

-It's really rough.</font>

OK, here we go.</font>

All right, um, $200 to anyone
  who gets her so pissed she</font>

slaps your face.</font>

-$200?</font>

-200.</font>

You want to take this?</font>

-I don't know.</font>

-Look, if you don't step
  up, I'm gonna, man.</font>

That's 200 bones.</font>

-All right.</font>

-She's just gonna slap you.</font>

She's just gonna slap you.</font>

-Hey.</font>

-Yeah?</font>

What?</font>

-What?</font>

-What-- what-- what the fuck
    do you want, creep?</font>

Huh?</font>

-Did you-- did you
 go to Parkside?</font>

I'm sorry, I thought you
  were somebody else.</font>

I'm sorry.</font>

-He's walking back.</font>

-Walking back.</font>

-He's walking back.</font>

He's walking back.</font>

-All right, you know what?</font>

Watch the master at work.</font>

OK?</font>

Excuse me.</font>

-Oh!</font>

-Oh!</font>


-Pay up, brother.</font>

-How'd you get her to do that?</font>

-I told her I'd buy
 her a drink if she</font>

slapped me in the face.</font>


-What?</font>

-It's a little bit of a cheat,
 but I'm gonna let it slide.</font>

I'm gonna let it slide.</font>

-Whoa, put that shit away.</font>

-Sh.</font>

Dude, there's enough
   for everyone.</font>

-No, no, no.</font>

Take it in the bathroom
     or something.</font>

-Hey, I am--</font>

I am comfortable here.</font>

That bathroom stinks,
      all right?</font>

-Oh, she's coming.</font>

She's coming over now.</font>

She's coming over now.</font>

-Hey, you guys can't
   do that here.</font>


-Oh my god, I'm so sorry.</font>

Caren--</font>

let me fix this.</font>

It feels broken to me.</font>

Here.</font>

That's like a curtain.</font>

You can't even see
over here, right?</font>

Caren.</font>

You's the best.</font>

Thank you, Caren.</font>


-All right, can I--</font>

-Please, hit it.</font>

-Oh, yeah.</font>

-Where are we going next?</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): You want
    to move-- move camp?</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.</font>

-Um, ooh--</font>

I know a really good
    strip club.</font>

Are you all right strip clubs?</font>

It's a really classy joint.</font>

-Yes.</font>

-She's OK with that?</font>

Want to get a couple
 lap dances, buddy?</font>

-No, no, no.</font>

I gotta go home.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Boo, Craig.</font>

-For real?</font>

That's not--</font>

for real?</font>

You know what you need?</font>

You need to get a little
intoxicated with a buddy of</font>

yours that you haven't
  hung out with in a</font>

very, very long time.</font>

That's exactly what you need.</font>

-That's exactly right.</font>

You want to hurt feelings?</font>

It's Violet's birthday.</font>

Look at her crying.</font>

She wants you to say.</font>

-All right, I will hang out for
   just a little bit longer.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Yes.</font>

-But that's it.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Get over
     here and hit this.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): That's
    really nice, man.</font>

-No, no, no.</font>

I'm not having any of that.</font>

I'll get diarrhea.</font>

[techno music]</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): This place
      is bullshit, man.</font>

-This place is fucking
       awesome.</font>

-No touching.</font>

Come on.</font>

Tell you what, I'll give you
 $200 whoever touches that</font>

stripper's ass with a slap.</font>

-Oh, come on.</font>

-$200?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

No.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Oh, shit.</font>

Let's go, baby.</font>


-That was too good.</font>

-How about we laugh about it
   in the car, all right?</font>

-Come on, slow down, Turbo.</font>

-No, look-- never mind.</font>

You know what, Vince?</font>

It was great catching
     up with you.</font>

Nice meeting you guys.</font>

But I really--</font>

I gotta get home.</font>

-Oh, come on, Craig.</font>

Are you kidding me, Craig?</font>

Come on.</font>

-Hey.</font>

Assholes.</font>

-What are you doing?</font>

What's up?</font>

-You the one who hit
 one of our girls?</font>

-No, I didn't do it.</font>

It wasn't me.</font>

I swear to God.</font>

-You lying piece of shit.</font>

I'll fuck you up.</font>

-Craig, $500 if you
   hit him first.</font>

Oh!</font>


-Aw--</font>

Oof.</font>

Shit.</font>

Aw, shit.</font>

[distant voices]</font>

[strumming guitar]</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
    that's awesome.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): That's--</font>

did you just--</font>

did you just make that up?</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): I was
  just following her.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Go in,
 like, from the outside.</font>

Like, from the inside
   here like bath--</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): Uh-huh.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): So
   you wouldn't be</font>

able to hear outside.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): Oh, nice.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): So we do
 have a set at the studio.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): Nice.</font>

Oh, that's good.</font>

-Here he is.</font>

-Hey.</font>

Sleeping beauty.</font>

-Where are we?</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Hey, you
dropped like a souffle, dude.</font>

So we had to split before
   the cops got there.</font>

We thought, you know what?</font>

Let's just bring him here,
   get you cleaned up.</font>

I got some sick painkillers
        for you too.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): He's got
 this place dialed in, man.</font>

There's, like, 1,000 years of
  scotch in here right now.</font>

-Here.</font>

Here.</font>

Hold on, hold on.</font>

I got it, I got it.</font>

[too loud music]</font>

-Sorry, sorry, sorry,
    sorry, sorry.</font>

Sorry, sorry.</font>

I forgot.</font>

Sorry.</font>

Here you go.</font>

Hey, I'm proud of you.</font>

You hit him first.</font>

-I didn't think I was gonna get
    in a fight tonight, man.</font>

-You know what?</font>

I--</font>

I don't think that you
 can necessarily call</font>

that a fight, brother.</font>

Here, that'll make
 you feel better.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): But
    you know what?</font>

That was awesome.</font>

that was--</font>

that was bad-ass
is what it was.</font>

It was so awesome.</font>

This--</font>

here's the thing.</font>

You will never forget this
night, you know, or who you</font>

were with--</font>

me and Vince and Violet.</font>

I mean, even if you never
  see us again, you will</font>

never forget us.</font>

I think that's some
   awesome shit.</font>

I mean, I--</font>

I honestly think about shit
  like that all the time.</font>

-Yeah!</font>

Give him a yeah!</font>

-I just want to go home.</font>


-Hey, uh--</font>

I'm gonna get those
    painkillers.</font>

I've got, like, a straight
    up pharmacy here.</font>

Actually, my brother's
  a real pharmacist.</font>

But it doesn't matter.</font>

All right, roll with
     me, Vince.</font>

-He owes you one.</font>


-I can email these
  to you later.</font>

Here, let me get something
  to clean you up a bit.</font>

-OK.</font>

-Now, I mean, he's not-- he's
not gonna like that very much.</font>

-Come on, buddy.</font>

It's gonna be hilarious.</font>

-(CHUCKLING) OK.</font>

All right.</font>

OK.</font>

-All right, let me-- give me--</font>

I'm gonna grab some
   party favors.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

Yeah, yeah.</font>

Ta-da.</font>

-Wow.</font>

Oh my god.</font>

You sure know how
  to party, huh?</font>

-Right?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

That's-- that's a whole
      tackle box.</font>

-We'll catch some
 fish with this.</font>


-It's OK.</font>

Don't worry about it.</font>

I appreciate you trying
    to help me out.</font>

-I'll try and be more gentle.</font>

Have you ever broken
  anything before?</font>

-Uh, just my foot.</font>

I was trying to do some stupid
skateboarding trick some time.</font>

-What did it feel like?</font>

-I don't even remember,
        really.</font>

-I used to watched the older
  kids in my neighborhood</font>

skateboard when I was
    a little girl.</font>

-Yeah?</font>

-There was this one boy that
 I sort of had a crush on.</font>

He was always trying harder
    than all the others.</font>

And I remember one time he was
   trying to do this trick.</font>

And they had set up a
  jump on the curb.</font>

He was trying to
 pick up speed.</font>

And this SUV whipped
 around the corner.</font>

I didn't actually see it
happen, but I heard it.</font>

The sound that it made
   when it hit him.</font>

It was so strange.</font>

It sounded like--</font>

like branches snapping.</font>

It sounded like he was
  made out of wood.</font>

-So the first thing they see
    that allows them the</font>

right to meet you.</font>

Here you go.</font>

This should do it.</font>

-What is it?</font>

-Uh, I think they're
     Percocets.</font>

I think.</font>

But nothing a doctor
wouldn't prescribe.</font>

So you're fine.</font>

In the clear.</font>


-[whispers]</font>

-All right, gang.</font>

Let's-- let's head outside.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-Come on.</font>

I want to show you something.</font>

-Come on, Craig.</font>

Come on, you got a little
       patched up?</font>

Move it, buddy.</font>

Ooh.</font>

-Killer view, right?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-Yeah, I have a-- another place
     by the water in Palos</font>

Verdes and a condo in Malibu.</font>

But this is all--</font>

this is all Violet's
  baby right here.</font>

I just gave her the checkbook
and I said, hey, whatever you</font>

create are my desires.</font>

And clearly she's
 doing it, right?</font>

She put together every
     inch of it.</font>

-What?</font>

Oh, what the fuck?</font>


-Fuck off.</font>

-Craig, wait, wait, wait, wait.</font>

Come here.</font>

Don't be like that.</font>

Come here, man.</font>

Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig.</font>

Wait, wait, wait, wait.</font>

Stop, stop, stop.</font>

-Oh, what are you gonna
 take a shit on me now?</font>

Get the fuck out of here.</font>

-Relax, man.</font>

That was for $300, all right?</font>

You would have done the
   same exact thing.</font>

-Oh, yeah?</font>

You think so?</font>

-I'm gonna rob him.</font>

-What?</font>

-This fucking idiot has
    got a safe-full</font>

of cash in his office.</font>

I'm gonna take it.</font>

-Are you insane, you
    fucking ape?</font>

I just want to get
   out of here.</font>

-There is, like, $150,000
    in cash in there.</font>

Now, for him, that's a
 drop in the bucket.</font>

But for us, that's a whole
      new life, man.</font>

Think about it.</font>

-I'm not gonna rob him.</font>

-OK, fine.</font>

That's fine, but the last time
 I checked you needed money.</font>

This right here, this
 is your opportunity.</font>

-Yeah, my opportunity
   to get arrested.</font>

He's seen our faces.</font>

He knows our names.</font>

-He's not calling the cops.</font>

He's not gonna call them.</font>

-That is a really crazy
      assumption.</font>

No, it's not.</font>

Not when you think about it.</font>

Any fucking cop that isn't blind
      is going to take one</font>

look at his dilated pupils and
   throw him in jail right</font>

alongside of us.</font>

He's not calling the cops.</font>

Now look, I'm doing
  this either way.</font>

Now, if you don't want to be a
 part of it, you should leave</font>

right fucking now.</font>

-Wait, wait, wait.</font>

What am I supposed to do?</font>

-Just hold the girl,
     all right?</font>

I'll take care of the rest.</font>

-You're not gonna hurt
    him, are you?</font>

-No.</font>

No, I'm not gonna fucking--</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): You guys
 jerking each other off in</font>

there or something?</font>

-Why, you want to come
  in here and watch?</font>

Nobody's getting hurt.</font>

Just grab violet and
   hold on tight.</font>

-You bros kiss and make up?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-Ding, ding.</font>

-Ooh.</font>

-Violet's got all of her music
  hooked up with the stereo.</font>

So there's, like, 12,000
  tunes we can listen</font>

to on shuffle, right?</font>

Play that crazy instrumental
           honey.</font>

Oh you know, it's the one with
   the-- with the strings.</font>

Ooh, or just play this one.</font>

This is actually the
    better vibe.</font>

Better for the vibe, actually.</font>

Here's your cocktail.</font>

Uh, are you girls done
with the ladies room?</font>

'Cause I gotta pee.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

Yeah.</font>

Hey, uh, Colin--</font>

well, I hate to do
   this to you.</font>

-What the fuck, man?</font>

-I'm gonna need all the
  money in that safe.</font>

-Dude, this is fucking really
      stupid, all right?</font>

-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</font>

Now, you and I are gonna
    wait right here.</font>

Craig's gonna get
  it for us, OK?</font>

What's the combination?</font>

-Combination?</font>

I--</font>

I--</font>

I don't--</font>

-Look, don't fuck with me, OK?</font>

-Dude, you fucking
 gotta chill, OK?</font>

We got a good party going
     here, all right?</font>

-Tell me the combination.</font>

-I told you, I don't know it.</font>

It's not locked, Vince.</font>

-You fucking shitting me?</font>

You expect me to believe that?</font>

-I--</font>

I can't remember the
numerical sequence.</font>

OK?</font>

It was her birthday and then
I changed it to her social.</font>

I can't-- it's not
 fucking locked.</font>

-It's a safe-full of cash.</font>

-Well, I guess I--</font>

I, uh--</font>

I guess trust my bros
    too much, huh?</font>

-You know what?</font>

Hey Craig, you're gonna
      handle this.</font>

Come here.</font>

Just walk over to the couch.</font>

Come on.</font>

Sit down, sit down.</font>

Sit down.</font>

CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): What
   do I do with her?</font>

-Just-- just put her on
 the couch next to him.</font>

-OK.</font>

Watch your--</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Don't
  do anything stupid.</font>

-Uh-huh.</font>

All right.</font>

Whoa.</font>

-You keep it unlocked?</font>

What are you, fucking stupid?</font>

Come on, bro.</font>

Come on.</font>

-Ah, fucking cock.</font>

-What's taking so long, Craig?</font>

-Give me a sec.</font>

Let's go.</font>

I got it.</font>

-You got all of it?</font>

-Yeah, yeah.</font>

Come on.</font>

-How much was in there?</font>

-I don't know.</font>

I didn't count it.</font>

Let's get the fuck
   out of here.</font>

-All right.</font>

Yeah.</font>

You know what, Colin?</font>

I'm also gonna need
  those car keys.</font>

-Oh, uh, I think they're on the
    shelf right over there.</font>

-Fucking cool it.</font>

Take a fucking moment.</font>

-I just want to say, this
     was not my idea.</font>

He came up with the idea.</font>

I told him it was a bad idea.</font>

-Shut it.</font>

Let's all just chill for a
fucking moment, all right?</font>

Let's hit pause.</font>

-(MUFFLED) Yeah.</font>

-OK.</font>

-Want to?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-Hey, how about we pretend?</font>

You want to pretend something?</font>

Let's-- let's pretend.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): You're
      fake bullies.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
 Yeah, that's it.</font>

Good, Vince.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): OK.</font>

-Let's just pretend these
  last 15 minutes didn't</font>

even happen, all right?</font>

-What do you mean, dude?</font>

We just tried to rob you.</font>

-Yeah, that was really
    fucking lame.</font>

That was really fucking
        stupid.</font>

All right, listen, Violet and
  I haven't necessarily been</font>

honest with you guys either,
  but we're willing to let</font>

bygones be bygones, all right?</font>

-OK.</font>

Bygones are bygones.</font>

We did not try to rob you.</font>

I didn't just hold a knife
     to your throat.</font>

-I know, Vince.</font>

I just said fucking rewind.</font>

That doesn't exist.</font>

The past-- shut the fuck up.</font>

The past is the past,
      all right?</font>

We're in the present.</font>

Didn't exist.</font>

Let's start over.</font>

Let's reset.</font>

I'm cool with it.</font>

Are you cool with it?</font>

OK.</font>

Guys, all right,
 so we're cool.</font>

-We're cool.</font>

-Let's push play.</font>

-You're not gonna call
   the cops on us?</font>

-I'm not gonna call the
  fucking cops, cross</font>

my heart, all right?</font>

-So-- what-- what the
  fuck is this, huh?</font>

What the fuck is this?</font>

-This is Violet's
 birthday, guys.</font>

What am I gonna get this girl?</font>

Look at her, she's a vision.</font>

My God.</font>

That girl's got everything.</font>

She can but everything
      she wants.</font>

You gotta think outside
     the box, guys.</font>

So Violet and I came
 up with this idea</font>

for an awesome night.</font>

-You gonna find a couple of
losers, you pay them a bunch</font>

of money, and you laugh your
asses off while they humiliate</font>

themselves.</font>

Awesome fucking night.</font>

Happy birthday.</font>

-Stop.</font>

Come on.</font>

Are you kidding me?</font>

You guys aren't losers.</font>

You're fucking awesome.</font>

This has been a night, right?</font>

This has been fucking amazing.</font>

This is more-- this is more
 like a reality game show.</font>

-What reality game show?</font>

-You know, the game shows
    when they gobble,</font>

like, animal dicks.</font>

They make them do that.</font>

Or put their head in a bucket
  of snakes or eat bugs, you</font>

know, shit like that.</font>

Except this isn't TV.</font>

Right?</font>

That and there's 250,000
   tax-free dollars.</font>

-$250,000?</font>

-What?</font>

This money's for us?</font>

-Yeah, down.</font>

-Fucking down.</font>

-I'm down.</font>

I'm down, Colin.</font>

I'm down.</font>

-Fucking stay down, Vince.</font>

-OK.</font>

OK.</font>

-It's cool, bro.</font>

It's cool.</font>

-You gotta win it.</font>

That's-- you know.</font>

You know what's funny?</font>

This money that was in the safe
   was for the fucking game.</font>

And we were gonna give it to
 you, and you guys took it.</font>

You know what that's like?</font>

Um--</font>

there's a word for it.</font>

-Irony?</font>

-Thank you.</font>

Super irony is what it is.</font>

Super fucking irony.</font>

-What-- what do we have to do?</font>

-Whatever we say.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): You're not--
    you're not-- you're not</font>

gonna call the cops on us?</font>

-Call the cops on you?</font>

No, I'm not gonna call the
   fucking cops on you.</font>

-And we can leave whenever
       we want to?</font>

-I'd be bummed.</font>

I really would.</font>

But you're free to go.</font>

You're free to go.</font>

You wouldn't get this.</font>

-OK.</font>

But let me tell you this, no
 matter how much money's in</font>

that box, I am not
sucking his dick.</font>

-Oh--</font>

no dudes boning dudes or
  blowing each other.</font>

No.</font>

You just have to do
  whatever we say.</font>

Not that.</font>

-All right.</font>

So what-- what-- what--
     do I gotta do?</font>

-All right!</font>

We're back.</font>

Good decision.</font>

How about this.</font>

$500 to whoever can hold their
     breath the longest.</font>

-That's it?</font>

Yeah, I'm game.</font>

Come on.</font>


COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  There you go.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.</font>

I'm down.</font>

I'm game.</font>

I just hold my breath?</font>

-Yeah, longer than he does.</font>

-OK.</font>

I'm going first.</font>

You timing me?</font>

-All right.</font>

-Yeah, you ready?</font>

-Yep.</font>

-Craig, hey.</font>

You said you were just going
      out for a drink.</font>

It's 2:00 AM.</font>

I'm sorry.</font>

I, uh, lost track of time.</font>

Enrique and I--</font>

-I--</font>

I talked to Enrique.</font>

-Then I guess he told
  you what happened.</font>

-Baby, look.</font>

I'm not mad.</font>

OK?</font>

Just come home.</font>

Just come home and we'll--
   we'll figure it out.</font>

Craig.</font>

-I'm coming home.</font>

Just give me 45 minutes.</font>

Trust me.</font>

-Craig, $300 to hang
   up the phone.</font>

-Who is that?</font>

-Listen--</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  Now it's 200.</font>

AUDREY (ON PHONE): Babe--</font>


-Aw, we gotta pay.</font>

Oh shit, hold on.</font>

Hold on.</font>

Oh my god.</font>

1:59, you motherfucker.</font>

Holy shit.</font>

Oh, you don't get
 a taste of this?</font>

-What was that?</font>

Why'd you just give him money?</font>

-I gave him $200 to hang
    up on his wife.</font>

He did it.</font>

-$200?</font>

What?</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, yeah.</font>

-All right, my turn now?</font>

-Your turn, Craig.</font>

Are you ready?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-Three, two, one, go.</font>

-That's--</font>

that's not fair.</font>

-What's not fair?</font>

-You give--</font>

-I get to decide.</font>

-All right, how much-- how
  much time did I have?</font>

-You were one minute,
     58 seconds.</font>

-OK.</font>

-Oh.</font>

-How you doing, buddy?</font>

Huh?</font>

You all right?</font>

You know, it actually
   really starts to</font>

hurt after one minute.</font>

No, you know what?</font>

I think he's about to blow.</font>

-He actually looks better than
    you did at that point.</font>

-Yeah, I think he's got
    this in the bag.</font>

I saw this documentary where
guys that dive for lobsters</font>

can go, like, five minutes.</font>

-What?</font>

Huh, that doesn't help?</font>

What?</font>

What, it's just a little poke.</font>

What, huh?</font>

-Oh, shit, bitch.</font>

He's going to reach you.</font>

53, 54, 55--</font>

oh shit!</font>

-Ha, ha, ha!</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Oh!</font>

-Fuck, Vince.</font>

-Pay up.</font>

-That got hairy.</font>

-You serious?</font>

You pay him?</font>

He just cheated.</font>

-I didn't set any rules.</font>

-Relax, man.</font>

We're just having fun.</font>

-What's next?</font>

-Oh, I like that.</font>

Let's go back out
 front, shall we?</font>

This-a-way.</font>

Let's go this way.</font>

Look at that.</font>

You see that shit?</font>

-That's shit.</font>

-Yes, that's what I said.</font>

That shit.</font>

-Wait, you-- you want us to--</font>

-No.</font>

Eat it?</font>

No.</font>

No, no.</font>

I want you to see that
     shit because</font>

it's part of the story.</font>

You see that house over there?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-Those assholes always
  let their dog take</font>

a shit on my lawn.</font>

The other day I came out here
   to talk to the gardener.</font>

I stepped in a pile of shit,
wearing a brand new pair of</font>

suede oxfords.</font>

I was so fucking pissed.</font>

They were ruined.</font>

-OK, so?</font>

-So I want revenge
on the neighbors.</font>

$800 to whoever can sit
  inside their house.</font>

Photographic evidence
      required.</font>

-That's crazy.</font>

-All right, $1,200.</font>

That's my final offer.</font>

-Sure.</font>

-I'm in.</font>

-I like it.</font>

Misfit.</font>

-Craig, you-- you--</font>

you really don't want
 to do this, do you?</font>

-No, I don't want to take a shit
    in this person's house,</font>

but I need the money.</font>

My family needs the money.</font>

-You know, this-- this-- this
  is breaking and entering.</font>

That's minimum two-year
sentence, just so you know.</font>

-Hey, dummy.</font>

We just held them at knifepoint,
        and this feels a</font>

million times safer.</font>

You're not backing
  out, are you?</font>

-No.</font>

No, no.</font>

I'm not backing out.</font>

Thanks to you and your shitty
back up and the fact that you</font>

never searched Violet, this
 stupid fucking game is the</font>

only way I'm getting
 out of this house</font>

with any real money.</font>

So no, I'm not backing out.</font>

-Just hold the girl.</font>

I'll take care of the rest.</font>

I remember that being your
 sole instruction to me.</font>

-I've been arrested
    before, OK?</font>

I've been through the system.</font>

I know I can handle it.</font>

You, on the other hand?</font>

That's all I'm saying.</font>

-Good luck, man.</font>


-You son of a--</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): You
  gotta-- you gotta</font>

start writing lyrics.</font>

You really have to.</font>

OK, then just start journaling
 and then later turn it into</font>

something, you know
  what I'm saying?</font>

Hey, there he is.</font>

Yo, you got something for me?</font>

Oh, no.</font>

Oh no, really?</font>

Oh my god.</font>

Look at-- you did it.</font>

I can't-- baby, you
 want to see this?</font>

-I'm good.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  What is that?</font>

What is that?</font>

-All right, you know what?</font>

So Craig, yeah, he took a shit
  in your neighbor's house.</font>

Big fucking deal.</font>

This little fucker's still
 gonna crap in your yard.</font>

How about I take care of
   the actual problem</font>

permanently, huh?</font>

How much for that?</font>

Five, $6,000?</font>

-Uh, how about, uh, nothing?</font>

Does that figure suit you OK?</font>

-What?</font>

-I'm not gonna pay you to
   kill a helpless dog.</font>

-Yeah, but--</font>

-What kind of sick birthday
   present would that be?</font>

It's er birthday, Vince.</font>

-So I--</font>

I just did all of that
  for-- for nothing?</font>

VIOLET (OFFSCREEN): Oh, cutie.</font>

Oh, you are cute, aren't you?</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): That was
really not fucking cool, what</font>

you just did, man.</font>

You could have really fucked
     me up over there.</font>

CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): You fucking
  punched me in the stomach</font>

before, man.</font>

You fucking pissed
 on me out there.</font>

-That is not the same thing.</font>

-How is that not
the same thing?</font>

Think about it.</font>

-Get your fucking finger
  out of my face, man.</font>

-Come on, guys.</font>

Ease up.</font>

It's supposed to be
   a celebration.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): What are
    we doing next, huh?</font>

-Keeping it moving,
    I like that.</font>

How about--</font>

-Where's my money?</font>

-Oh, shit.</font>

My bad.</font>

100, 200, 300--</font>

-I think we all know
   how this ends.</font>

Can we just fast forward
   this part, please?</font>

-As promised.</font>

-What are we doing next, huh?</font>

-I got it.</font>

$300 to whoever can make
me a vodka tonic first.</font>

Three, two, one, go.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): One vodka
tonic coming right up, sir.</font>

Hey, uh, could you toss me one
   of those limes, brother?</font>

All right.</font>

-You OK?</font>

You're really tense.</font>

All coiled up.</font>

So many knots.</font>

I think you'd feel better
 if you let me fuck you.</font>

-What?</font>

What did she just say?</font>

-Still waiting on that
    drink, Vince.</font>

-Would you like that, Craig?</font>

Would you like to fuck me?</font>

-Are you hearing
this right now?</font>

-Yeah, I am.</font>

What's the matter, Craig?</font>

Why don't you want
 to fuck my wife?</font>

She's hot, isn't she?</font>

Don't you want to fuck her?</font>

-You don't care?</font>

-Why would I?</font>

-It's cool.</font>

We have an open relationship.</font>

-Yeah, that's--</font>

great, but my wife and I don't.</font>

So--</font>

-Hey, um, I--</font>

I'd fuck you, Violet.</font>

-Please, Craig?</font>

I really want to.</font>

-Look, uh, you're a lovely,
      you know, woman.</font>

I'm flattered, really.</font>

But I--</font>

I just can't do that.</font>

-Come on, Craig.</font>

It's her birthday.</font>

-Guys, I'm married.</font>

It's not going to happen.</font>

-Well, how about if I paid
     you to fuck her?</font>

Would it be cool then?</font>

-Paid me?</font>

-Yeah, how about, uh, $2,000?</font>

-This is some weird-ass
       shit, man.</font>

-I can't believe I'm
    saying this.</font>

Uh--</font>

how about 4,500?</font>

How does that number sound?</font>

When I put the money in the
   wallet for-- for-- for</font>

punching that dude, I saw
   the eviction notice.</font>

Sorry for reading it,
  but shit, I mean,</font>

it was right there.</font>

-Oh my god.</font>

-Please, Craig.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): Obviously
  the guy doesn't want to.</font>

OK?</font>

I mean, cut-- cut--
  cut him a break.</font>

I'll fuck her for free, man.</font>

-Cool it, Vince.</font>

It's not gonna happen.</font>

She's into married dudes.</font>

What can I say?</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): That's
  some fucking bullshit.</font>

-$4,500?</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): All that.</font>

-I love my wife.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Why don't
     you prove it, man?</font>

Show her.</font>

Get your family off
    the street.</font>

Pay your rent, Craig.</font>

Oh, that shit's hot.</font>

-I'm gonna fucking come.</font>

-I'm coming too, baby.</font>

-Oh my god.</font>

-Oh, fuck.</font>

-Aw.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Oh, fuck.</font>

Oh--</font>


-Shit.</font>

-What the fuck?</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): -Ah, shit.</font>

Oh fuck, baby.</font>

Well fuck, man.</font>

Things get a little sticky
       there, boys.</font>

I might, uh, have to go
downstairs and make a quick</font>

wardrobe change.</font>

Hoo.</font>

Ahh.</font>

We'll keep the game going.</font>

Back in a flash, boys.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): You
did not deserve that.</font>

Not one bit.</font>


-I'm done.</font>

-What do you mean done?</font>

-I'm going home.</font>

-Good.</font>

Glad to see you go.</font>

-Ah, shit.</font>

-See you in five years,
      huh, buddy?</font>

Don't forget to write.</font>

-All right, bitches.</font>

You ready to make
 some real money?</font>

-Oh, yeah.</font>

That's what I'm talking about.</font>

-Hm, would you like that?</font>

Craig?</font>

Where's Craig?</font>

-Oh, no.</font>

He peaced.</font>

Yeah.</font>

No, I think cheating on his wife
    really freaked him out.</font>

Where's she going?</font>

-He's gone.</font>

-Well--</font>

well, what's the problem, huh?</font>

I mean, I'm still here, right?</font>

We-- we can keep going,
       can't we?</font>

-No.</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): Wow.</font>

I'm feeling a little unloved
     right now, buddy.</font>

-No, no, no.</font>

You're boss, bro.</font>

It's just that we-- we-- we
 hate breaking up the crew.</font>

-That guy hasn't been part of
 the crew since fucking high</font>

school, all right?</font>

Come on, let's keep
  this going, huh?</font>

What do you want
 me to do next?</font>

Huh?</font>

-Follow me.</font>

Cut your pinkie off.</font>

Is that not cool?</font>

-Fuck you.</font>

-Do or you don't, it doesn't
       matter to me.</font>

It's your pinkie.</font>

You use it for, like, nothing.</font>

-What's the iron for?</font>

-To cauterize the wound.</font>

-How much is this worth?</font>

-How much?</font>

Yeah.</font>

How much, he wants to know.</font>

Let's think about it.</font>

Let's say--</font>

$25,000.</font>

-$25,000?</font>

To cut off my pinkie?</font>

OK, I'll do it.</font>

-Really?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-That's cool.</font>

OK.</font>

-Yeah, I'll cut off my pinkie.</font>

-Awesome.</font>

-For $25,000.</font>

CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): I'll
     do it for 23.</font>

-Oh, shit.</font>

What the fuck?</font>

Are you shitting me?</font>

Where the fuck have you been?</font>

What are you, like, a ninja?</font>

-I'll cut my pinkie
  off for $23,000.</font>

-What the fuck is wrong
    with you, Craig?</font>

-You don't get it, do you?</font>

-No.</font>

Look, you've already got your
    rent money, all right?</font>

Let somebody else have a shot.</font>

-That 4,500 takes care of my
eviction problems, but only</font>

this month.</font>

What about next month?</font>

My wife and I are
 both unemployed.</font>

How do I pay my rent?</font>

How do I feed my kid?</font>

23 grand gives me some--
  some breathing room.</font>

So if I gotta cut my pinkie
       off for that,</font>

fuck it, I'll do it.</font>

-That's right, Craig.</font>

You gotta think about
     the future.</font>

-Yeah.</font>

No, no.</font>

But wait, wait-- what
    about me, huh?</font>

Every time I go to work,
    I'm this close--</font>

this fucking close to be
  thrown back in jail.</font>

And I don't make that
     much money.</font>

Not for what I fucking do.</font>

-Nobody told you to drop
  out of high school.</font>

You could have done anything
 you wanted, but you didn't</font>

want to work for it.</font>

Your life is exactly
 what you made it.</font>

-Wow.</font>

Fuck you.</font>

I'll do it for 22.</font>

-21.</font>

-20.</font>

And if you say another fucking
 word, I will knock you out.</font>

-19.</font>

-I said shut your
  fucking mouth.</font>

18.</font>

-All right.</font>

-$15,000.</font>

-Are you fucking crazy, man?</font>

You're gonna cut off your
   pinkie for $15,000?</font>

That's a finger.</font>

-It's not like it's
   gone forever.</font>

Even if costs me six grand to
 sew it back on, that's still</font>

9,000 more dollars than when
  I woke up this morning.</font>

-All right.</font>

Fine, man.</font>

If you want to mutilate
      yourself for</font>

$15,000, go right ahead.</font>

-All right.</font>

Let's, uh--</font>

let's get it ready.</font>

Uh, OK.</font>

This one, right?</font>

-Oh, wait.</font>

Could we do-- because
     I use that--</font>

-Sure.</font>

Yeah.</font>

Your choice.</font>

-Thank you.</font>

That's nice of you.</font>

-There you go.</font>

Care to do the honors?</font>

-It would be my pleasure.</font>

-Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

You--</font>

you don't want to
  do it, Colin?</font>

-Sorry, dude.</font>

Too gross.</font>

-Let's put that right there.</font>

OK?</font>

I'm going to count to three.</font>

One--</font>

-Wait, wait, wait, wait.</font>

Jesus Christ.</font>

Hold on.</font>

OK, I'm ready.</font>

Are you ready?</font>

-One.</font>

-No, no, no.</font>

Not yet.</font>

Just are you ready?</font>

-Yes, I'm ready.</font>

Are you ready?</font>

-Are you sure you don't want
 to do this instead of him?</font>

-Sorry, bro.</font>

-OK.</font>

OK, OK, OK.</font>

Go.</font>

-One--</font>

-Wait.</font>

-What?</font>

-I gotta check to make
 sure the iron's hot.</font>

OK.</font>

I--</font>

I don't want blood everywhere.</font>

CRAIG (OFFSCREEN):
  Jesus Christ.</font>

-We're good to go.</font>

-OK.</font>

For real this time, all right?</font>

-Oh yeah.</font>

-Do it, Vince.</font>

-One, two, three.</font>

-Oh shit, bro.</font>

You can't puss out on us now.</font>

-I need something
  for the pain.</font>

-What are you talking about?</font>

He hasn't even done it yet.</font>

-No, no.</font>

Something to take away the pain,
     to numb it, to keep me</font>

from feeling anything
 in the first place.</font>

-Oh, uh--</font>

you still got those
 pills I gave you?</font>

-Yeah, one of them.</font>

Somewhere.</font>

-Well, give it to me.</font>

I'll crush it up.</font>

You can rail it.</font>

You won't feel a
 fucking thing.</font>

-It's in here somewhere.</font>

Hold on.</font>

-There it is.</font>

It's done.</font>

And I hope it hurt.</font>

-Oh, shit.</font>

Fuck.</font>

You OK, Craig?</font>


-Let go.</font>

Just let go of your arm.</font>

-Here.</font>

Fucking here.</font>

-Come on, there we go.</font>

Go, go, go, go, go.</font>

Get it.</font>

Get it.</font>

Get it.</font>

-Fuck.</font>

-What are you waiting for?</font>

-It's still fucking attached.</font>

All the way off.</font>

That's the fucking deal, bro.</font>

-Are you fucking kidding me?</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  Get the knife.</font>

-Fuck that.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Oh, fuck.</font>


COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Fuck
  yeah, motherfucker.</font>

Yeah, motherfucker.</font>

Yeah, motherfucker.</font>

Fuck yeah, motherfucker.</font>


-Fuck, dude.</font>

You fucking did it.</font>

How's it feel to be
  $15,000 richer?</font>

-Do me a favor.</font>

Let me see it.</font>

I want to see the money.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Fuck,
  that's not a favor.</font>

You earned it, man.</font>

Fuck yes.</font>

Here.</font>

Fuck yeah.</font>

Fuck yeah.</font>

Five, 10, $15,000,
  motherfucker.</font>

Shit.</font>

That's fucking great.</font>

Right on, bro.</font>

Yeah.</font>

What's that sound?</font>


COLIN (OFFSCREEN): There
     it was again.</font>


-Oh, I think I just heard it.</font>

-Good.</font>

I thought I was going
    fucking crazy.</font>

-No, I heard it that time.</font>

VIOLET (OFFSCREEN): I think it's
     coming from over here.</font>

-Guys, do you know where
     my finger is?</font>

VIOLET (OFFSCREEN): Uh-oh.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  What's wrong?</font>

-Oh, the dog's dead.</font>

-What the fuck?</font>

What--</font>

how'd that happen?</font>

Oh, no.</font>

What the fuck?</font>

-Oh, it choked on
 Craig's finger.</font>

-All right, I'll take
    care of this.</font>

Go check on him.</font>

-Fuck.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): That's
      fucking weird.</font>

-Good luck reattaching that
     crew toy now, huh?</font>

-You're a real piece of
  shit, you know that?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

At least I didn't steal $25,000
        from my friend.</font>

-I need that money
  for my family.</font>

You'd just blow it on
  hookers and drugs.</font>

I know you.</font>

-Yeah, I know you too, Craig.</font>

-I'm not that person anymore.</font>

I have responsibilities.</font>

I have a life to live.</font>

You don't have shit to do but
  waste the world's oxygen.</font>

You're a fucking loser.</font>

You know that, Vince?</font>

-No.</font>

Yeah, I do.</font>

I know I'm a loser.</font>

See, I've always known that.</font>

But you, you really surprised
          me, Craig.</font>

You see, because you had
parents that loved you.</font>

And they took care of you.</font>

They sent you to college and
   got you an education.</font>

But look how you fucking
      turned out.</font>

I mean, you obviously didn't
    make it as a writer.</font>

I mean, hell, you can't even
keep a job changing oil at a</font>

fucking car shop.</font>

You had to fuck another woman
and mutilate yourself just to</font>

keep your family
off the street.</font>

So who's--</font>

who's the bigger loser?</font>

Huh?</font>

-Oh, you guys are still here.</font>

-Fuck, that smells good.</font>

-Doesn't it?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

-You hungry?</font>

-I could eat.</font>

-Then let's do it.</font>

Join me.</font>

Let's gain sustenance,
      shall we?</font>

You know what, honey, that
bottle we've been saving.</font>

Ah--</font>

this particular dish
 pairs well with a</font>

$10,000 bottle of tequila.</font>

Asuckamadee, Pancho Villa.</font>

-What the fuck?</font>

What?</font>

-Oh, no.</font>

Oh, no.</font>

-Moments ago you were raving
      about the smell.</font>

-Why-- why did you--</font>

-Make it?</font>

So you could eat
 it, obviously.</font>

-Yeah, but I thought you
 guys were dog people.</font>

-No, no.</font>

I just don't want to kill
    a helpless animal.</font>

But I mean, it's already
       dead, so--</font>

you're not vegetarians,
        are you?</font>

-Oh my god.</font>

I think I just became one.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Tastes
  like chicken, really.</font>

-But it's not a chicken.</font>

It's a dog.</font>

-Don't be so limited, bro.</font>

I've seen dog on menus
throughout the world.</font>

You need to get out.</font>

-Is it even safe to eat?</font>

-Yes.</font>

Cooked all the way through,
internal temperature of 165.</font>

I've got a meat thermometer.</font>

So what's the offer?</font>

$50,000 to whoever finishes
    their portion first.</font>

$50,000.</font>

That's probably more than you
 guys make in a year, right?</font>

Think about that.</font>

Takes away a lot of worry.</font>

Bills are paid.</font>

You have time to do
 things you wanted.</font>

It's a mental game, guys.</font>

It's easy to get past.</font>

-All right, fuck it.</font>

Yeah, I'm in.</font>

-Here's your--</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): I'm in.</font>

I'm in.</font>

I'm in.</font>

-Nice.</font>

Hold on.</font>

I don't trust him.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): First
  to finish, 50 grand.</font>

What's going on, guys?</font>

What are you waiting for?</font>

Let's eat.</font>

-Oh, I'm done.</font>

-Done.</font>

-Shit, that was close.</font>

Violet?</font>

VINCE (OFFSCREEN): No.</font>

No, no, no.</font>

Clearly I won.</font>

Look.</font>

Open your mouth.</font>

Open your mouth.</font>

-It's open.</font>

Ahh.</font>

-Fuck.</font>

Guys, that was a tie.</font>

-What?</font>

-Uh, we need a tiebreaker.</font>

Great idea.</font>

I guess whoever eats Craig's
   finger gets the money.</font>

-No.</font>

No, no.</font>


-Crying like a motherfucker?</font>


-That still counts, right?</font>

-It counts, Craig.</font>

You're the winner.</font>

-(CHUCKLING) I did it.</font>

50,000 fucking dollars.</font>


-You're fucking weak, Craig.</font>

You always were.</font>

-Let's get you some air.</font>

There we go.</font>

-Oh, fuck.</font>

You know what, fuck him, man.</font>

You know, he used to get his
 ass beat, his fucking ass</font>

handed to him, all the time.</font>

And who would he
come crying to?</font>

To me.</font>

To me, and I would always
      have his back.</font>

I always had your back.</font>

And how does he fucking
     repay me, huh?</font>

By thinking he's fucking
    better than me.</font>

You know, he thinks he fucking
     deserves that money.</font>

He doesn't deserve shit--</font>

not a fucking dime.</font>

Fuck, man.</font>

I almost fucking killed him.</font>

-Why don't you do it?</font>


-Do it.</font>

$250,000.</font>

I'll take care of
 the rest of it.</font>

This is your chance, Vince.</font>

Fresh start.</font>

Living the life you want.</font>

-$250,000?</font>

-You want to play us
 a slideshow, baby?</font>

She did this one for our
wedding, it's fucking killer.</font>

Craig, you want a
  beer or, like,</font>

an ice pack of something?</font>

-Uh, cab.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Fuck,
     you know what?</font>

You're right.</font>

It's fucking late.</font>

Slash early.</font>

You know, I'm feeling
    kinda brunchy.</font>

You guys into that?</font>

-Yeah.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): I could
 pound, like, 100 Bloody</font>

Mary's right now.</font>

CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): Hey Colin,
  can you call a cab for me?</font>

-Sure, man.</font>

But I'm paying for it.</font>

Because I'm a good host.</font>

I got some guy--</font>

here we go.</font>

Oh, there we go.</font>

Ha, ha.</font>

The reunion shot.</font>

CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): Colin.</font>

COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Yes.</font>

OK, OK, OK.</font>

Hi, is this Central Cab?</font>

Yeah, to pick up.</font>

The address is 1231 Waverly.</font>

Oh, Craig.</font>

Go ahead and get your 50,000.</font>

I trust you.</font>

Count it out.</font>

No, I was talking to a friend.</font>

All right, 20 minutes
   Oh shit, Vince.</font>

This shit was so funny.</font>

-Craig, let's get the
  fuck out of here.</font>



-Whoa, that was grim.</font>

That was grim.</font>

Hey.</font>

You know that--</font>

that maid service
 we talked about?</font>

Yeah, I need that now.</font>

It's been good partying
    with you, Craig.</font>

Good call on your boy.</font>

I thought my guy was
 gonna wrap it up.</font>


[baby crying]</font>

-Oh, it's OK.</font>


[music playing]</font>
