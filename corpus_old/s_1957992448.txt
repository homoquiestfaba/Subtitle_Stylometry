It's about love.

The things we do to get it,

and the things we do to keep it.

â™ª Guide me â™ª

â™ª o thou great jehovah â™ª

â™ª pilgrim through
this barren land â™ª

â™ª I am weak â™ª

â™ª but thou are mighty â™ª

â™ª hold me
with thy powerful hand â™ª

â™ª bread of heaven â™ª

â™ª bread of heaven â™ª

â™ª feed me till I want â™ª

[Congregation clapping]


â™ª Guide me, o thou... â™ª

Stop.

Mommy.again.

Mom! Again.

God gives you a gift,
you gotta use it right.

â™ª Guide me
o thou great jehovah â™ª

You have to learn the melody.

Once you learn it,
then you can play around,

do your little flourishes.

Now, do it again.

â™ª Guide me
o thou great jehovah â™ª

Know the melody
backward and forward.

â™ª Pilgrim through... â™ª

And enunciate.

â™ª ...this barren land â™ª

Pay attention to the words.

Complete every word.

â™ª I am weak
but thou are mighty â™ª

Every song is a story.

If it's not a story,
it's not a song.

â™ª Hold me
with thy powerful hand â™ª

Great singing comes from
three places.

â™ª Bread of heaven â™ª

The head, the heart...

â™ª Bread of heaven â™ª

And the gut.

And get your eyes off
that damn door, girl.

You know what, I quit. No, you don't quit.

You gave that up when you told
me that you wanted to do this.

Mommy, I just wanna sing.Again.

â™ª Guide me, o thou... â™ª

You will honor
your commitment to this, nippy.

â™ª ...great jehovah â™ª

Your idea, you see it through.

â™ª Pilgrim through this... â™ª

Pride.

You're a Houston.

â™ª to answer â™ª

â™ª your unspoken prayer â™ª

John: That's it.

Cissy: I had to
look the other way...

John: Just change the subject.

Cissy: Pretend I don't
know what's going on.

That's what you do every time.

You're out there doing
everything you big enough to do.

And I'm out there, on the road,

On the road busting your ass,
huh?

So what are you, the savior?

Sole breadwinner! That's right.
Sole breadwinner. For years.

I swear to god,

indistinctly]

Hey. Don't even worry about it.

[Glass shattering]

Cissy: Do it!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Both laughing]

Look at that.

Hey!

[Chaka Khan's
"papillon" playing]

Okay.

â™ª You took my breath away â™ª

This is so great.

This will be forever.

Nippy. I need you to listen now.

Mommy.

I love you.

That's great.

â™ª Chanson papillon â™ª


Check us out.

â™ª Just begun to fly â™ª

Clive!

Hey.

Clive, thanks for coming. Thank you.

So, she sings backup
for her mother. Uh-huh.

But wait till you see this girl.

I'm telling you, total knockout.

Model looks, right?
But the voice...

Oh, my god, the voice.
She's just... it's really...

All right, calm down.
I'm here, aren't I?

Come on.Yeah.

How're you doing? Good evening.

Evening, sir.

Cissy: I don't know who the hell

you think you talking to!

Think you're so damn grown!

Well, I know what I want!

You think you know
what you want!

Gary: Clive Davis!

Clive: Hi, Gary, how
are you? A pleasure.

Hey, Gerry.

[Coughing, clearing throat]

My voice. What?

My voice.

It's gone.

to do the opening solo.

What?

Mama, you were shouting
at me a second ago.

Well, maybe that's what done it!

And I need some time
to get it back,

so you start the show tonight.

I'm your mother,
no talking back.

Yeah, mommy, I just... look...

I need you to help me now.

Start the show.

Sing "the greatest love of all."
Not another word.

Don't make me whup your ass.


"Greatest love of all."
All right?

Gerry.

Cissy.clive.

How are you? Good to see you.

Nice to see you too.

[Audience clapping]

â™ª I believe the children
are our future â™ª

â™ª teach them well
and let them lead the way â™ª

â™ª show them all the beauty
they possess inside â™ª

â™ª give them a sense of pride â™ª

â™ª to make it easier â™ª

â™ª let the children's laughter â™ª

â™ª remind us how we used to be â™ª

â™ª everybody
searching for a hero â™ª

â™ª people need someone
to look up to â™ª

â™ª I never found anyone
who fulfilled my needs â™ª

â™ª a lonely place to be â™ª

â™ª and so I learned
to depend on me â™ª

â™ª I decided long ago â™ª

â™ª never to walk
in anyone's shadows â™ª

â™ª if I fail, if I succeed â™ª

â™ª at least I lived
as I believe â™ª

â™ª no matter
what they take from me â™ª

â™ª they can't take away
my dignity â™ª

[Audience cheering,
clapping]â™ª because the greatest â™ª

â™ª love of all â™ª

â™ª is happening to me â™ª

â™ª I found the greatest â™ª

â™ª love of all inside of me â™ª

â™ª the greatest love of all
â™ª [audience cheering]

â™ª Is easy to achieve â™ª

â™ª learning to love yourself â™ª

â™ª is the greatest love of all â™ª

â™ª and if, by chance
that special place â™ª

â™ª that you've been dreaming of â™ª

â™ª leads you to a lonely place â™ª

â™ª find your strength â™ª

â™ª in love â™ª

[Audience clapping, cheering]

She's incredible.

Clive: Okay.

Just okay?

I think I might have just heard

the greatest voice
of her generation.

Yeah. Yeah. That kind of "okay."

Gerry, my "okay" is different
than your "okay."

Mom. Clive: My "okay"

comes with investment
and legal obligations.

Yours comes
with a side of fries.


That's my baby girl.

Whitney Elizabeth Houston.

Whitney: "And distribution
rights for all albums

created by Whitney
Houston... heh.

Or arista during the term
of this agreement...

In perpetuity throughout
the universe"?

It means a damn long time.

Everywhere.

Wait.

Daddy, what? She's coming here for you.

Clive: Mm-hm.

If you move on, you take her
with you when you go.

Mr. Davis, you are not
my first record exec.

I'm just trying
to protect my family.

No, no, no. I understand.

Well, we have never given
that right to any artist.

Um...

But I believe in you.

So...

Best efforts.

Okay. Clive: Okay?

John: Mm-hm.

Here, let's take a picture.Okay.

All right. Ready for the shot?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Congratulations.
Welcome to arista.


Thank you. Clive: Thank you.

Cissy. Thank you. Thank you, clive.

John. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Congratulations.

Now, if you don't mind,

I want to get acquainted
with my new artist

and learn about
her musical tastes.

Okay.

Alone would be great.

It's what I was trying to...

Okay.yeah.

Clive: So, do you write songs?

No.

Have you ever tried? Mm-mm.

Is that okay? Yeah.

We'll just get people
to write them for you.

Now, what kind of songs
do you like?

[Breathing deeply] Hm.

Great big songs.

"Great big songs"?

[Both chuckle]

Yeah. All right, great big songs.

Yeah, that you almost
can't wrap your arms around.

Songs that are like
climbing a mountain,

that'll stretch me
vocally, that...

I really gotta sing
my raggedy ass off to sell.

Gospel? Country? Black? White?

All the above.

All the above? Mm-hm.

All of them.

A great song is a great song.

And you are 100% correct
on that.

Okay. So, then,
what we're gonna do

is we're gonna hire the finest
songwriters in america...

In the world,

to write a great big
vocally-ambitious song

for a great new
vocally-ambitious star.

What do you think?

Believe they'd do that for me? No.

But they'll do it for us.


Okay, so... can I...

Can I ask you something?
Yeah, you can ask me anything.

I'm an open book, Whitney,
just so you know.

Even though people say

that the text size is so small

that you need
very strong glasses.


You went to Harvard?

Law, yeah.

What was that like?

Well, stressful.

Actually, anxiety attacks.
I had...

Right here, darling.Sure.

Thank you so much.
Thank you. You're welcome.

But, you know, you work through
it. I worked through it.

How? Uh, how?

Exercises. Breathing exercises.

[Breathes deeply]


Yeah, but I did it, of course,

you know, away from
everyone because...

You know, you have to remember
that in those days,

and this was a long time ago...

In those days,
you couldn't admit

that there was ever
anything wrong with you.

And can you now?

I want to tell you one thing,
dear Whitney, before we begin.

I never get involved in the
personal lives of my artists.

I am not a babysitter,

I'm not a camp counselor,
I'm not a rabbi.

I know music.

I have an ear,
and I have an instinct.

And in this respect,
I can serve you.

And I will be there for you
at any hour.

Okay? Okay.

To you. Congratulations.

Thank you.

Mm.

Okay. Let's test that ear.

He said he can get me on TV,

and we drank champagne.

And, mommy, he called me
"vocally ambitious."

You let her come out
looking like this?

She ain't got a dress?

She needs to start
wearing a dress.

I told her to dress up. Why?

These are my nice jeans.

[In unison] Nice jeans?

Yeah, well, it's just me.

Yeah, well,
they don't wanna see "just you,"

and being nippy
ain't gonna get it.

And you need to take her
wig shopping.

If she's gonna go all the way,

hair short as mine
is not going to get it done.

You're a Princess.

With that voice and the looks,

you could be america's Princess.

Start looking like one.

Tough business, baby, I know.

I'm just gonna sing.

My next guest
has nurtured such superstars

as Barry manilow,
Melissa Manchester,

Chicago, Simon and Garfunkel,

Janis joplin...
And the list is endless.

Today, he's brought
his latest discovery with him,

and she is, in two words,
simply breathtaking.

Oh, god, I think
I'm gonna throw up.

No, no, no, no.

You got this in the bag,
Princess.

Come on now. Come on. Stand up.

Baby, get her something
to drink.

Some ginger ale, some soda pop...

Something like that. All right.

Hey. Hey.Mommy.

You're gonna be fine.

Just pretend you're singing
in the shower.

[Exhales sharply] You want me
to imagine I'm singing butt naked

in front of merv Griffin?[Laughs]

Come on. It's not helping.

Remember...

Head, heart, gut. Right?

Yeah.

You're my Princess.

All right? All right. Come
on. Clive: You know.

You just know
that you're in the presence...

You know what to do... of somebody special.

Merv: She's got it. Clive: She's got it.

Merv: Wait till you hear
her. Here's Whitney Houston.

[Audience clapping]

[Band playing "home"]

â™ª When I think of home â™ª

â™ª I think of a place â™ª

â™ª where there's love
overflowing â™ª

â™ª I wish I was home â™ª

â™ª I wish I was back there â™ª

â™ª with the things â™ª

â™ª I've been knowing â™ª

â™ª wind that makes
the tall grass â™ª

It's too slow. No, he's fine.

â™ª Bend into leaning â™ª

â™ª and suddenly
the raindrops that fall â™ª

Her skin tone is off.

â™ª They have a meaning â™ª

They're not lighting
her right. It's fine, cissy.

â™ª Sprinkling... â™ª

It's too slow.
It's too slow. It's too slow.

Cissy.

Cissy. Cissy.

Let's pick it up. Pick it up.

â™ª Clean â™ª

â™ª and suddenly my world â™ª

â™ª is gonna change its face â™ª

â™ª but I know â™ª

â™ª I know where I'm going â™ª

Whoo! â™ª and I have had my mind â™ª

â™ª spun around
and around in space â™ª

â™ª yet I've watched it growing â™ª

â™ª I know you're listening lord â™ª

â™ª so won't you please
try not to make it hard â™ª

â™ª to know I shouldn't believe
everything â™ª

â™ª everything that I see â™ª

â™ª tell me â™ª

â™ª should I try and stay â™ª

â™ª or maybe I should run away â™ª

â™ª would it be better â™ª

â™ª better, better, better â™ª

â™ª just to let things be? â™ª

â™ª Living here
in my brand-new world â™ª

â™ª it might be a fantasy, yes â™ª

â™ª yeah, it could be â™ª

â™ª but it taught me to love â™ª

â™ª so I know that it's real â™ª

â™ª it's real â™ª

â™ª it's real to me â™ª

â™ª and I've learned
that we must â™ª

â™ª look inside our hearts â™ª

â™ª to find â™ª

â™ª yeah, we gotta find â™ª

â™ª a world full of love â™ª

â™ª like yours, like â™ª

â™ª like mine â™ª

â™ª like home â™ª

â™ª home â™ª

[Audience cheering, clapping]

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, baby.

Merv: You won't forget
that name. Whitney Houston.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Upbeat song playing]

Clive: What do you think?

No.

No.i agree.

Man: Okay, this is
Whitney Houston. Take one.

â™ª A few stolen moments â™ª

â™ª is all that we shared â™ª

No.man: This is Whitney Houston.

â™ª Oh, where do
broken hearts go? â™ª

â™ª Can they find
their way home? â™ª

Let's try this one.

Man: And cut it there. Is that better?

Yeah, that's one word for it.


Man: Go again.

â™ª So I'm saving â™ª

â™ª all my love for you â™ª


What? What? What happened?

It's the lyrics. They're just...

It was beautiful. All
right. Let's do it again.

Okay. Okay, I'm serious.

["How will I know" playing]

â™ª How will I know
if he's thinking of me? â™ª

Maybe. Maybe? Why?

â™ª How will I know
if he really loves me? â™ª

â™ª I say a prayer
with every heartbeat â™ª

You know?

I could do something
with the chorus.

Go up a key, get more out of it.

Yeah, but that's not a reason
to do a song.

It's got to have a hook.

A hook? Yeah.


[Whitney Houston's
"how will I know" playing]

â™ª There's a boy â™ª

â™ª I know â™ª

â™ª he's the one I dream of â™ª

â™ª looks into â™ª

â™ª my eyes â™ª

â™ª takes me to the clouds above â™ª

â™ª mm-hm â™ª

â™ª ooh, I lose control â™ª

â™ª can't seem to get enough â™ª

â™ª uh-huh â™ª

â™ª when I wake from dreaming â™ª

â™ª tell me, is it really love? â™ª

Whitney: So? How do I look?

Ridiculous. I do not. Do I?

This is the look they want.

America's sweetheart.

And you're gonna give it to 'em.

Just watch me.

â™ª How will I know? â™ª

â™ª How will I know
if he really loves me? â™ª

â™ª I say a prayer
with every heartbeat â™ª

â™ª I fall in love
whenever we meet â™ª

â™ª I'm asking you 'cause you
know about these things â™ª

â™ª how will I know
if he's thinking of me? â™ª

[Whitney Houston's "you give
good love" playing on radio]


Holy shit! Holy shit.

Nip! Nip! Wake up!

Nip, wake the hell up!
Wake up, nip!

What? Nip, it's on! Listen!

[Both screaming]

Oh, my god! Wait, wait, wait!

This is big, right?

Big? What? This is huge.

Try huge! Oh, my god.Hey.
Hey, come work for me.

Huh? Full-time.

Handle bookings,
wardrobe, travel.

I don't know?
Find me a box of fruity pebbles

or a cap'n crunch
at 1 A.M. in the morning.

If you say "1 A.M.," you don't
need to say "in the morning."

That's why I need you.

I want someone
I can trust completely.

You're the only one.

Yeah, well, you could trust me,
but you can't afford me.

Well, okay, yeah. You can't afford me.

Well, I'm getting you
cheap, bitch. Yeah?

Yeah.okay. Okay.

Do your parents know?
Have you talked to them?

Your mom won't be happy.
She hates me.

We'll go see daddy.

[People chattering indistinctly]

Hey.hi.

Hi.hello.

[Exhales deeply]

It's gonna be okay.

John:
Just booked us a couple's table.

Just me and you
and a nice bottle of...

Let's pick this up later on.

Nippy. You know better than
to come charging into a room

without knocking.

How do you do?

Barbara, this is my daughter,
Whitney.

Congratulations.

Your dad's told me
a great deal about you.

So pretty.

Bye.

Bye, nippy. Uh...

[Door opens, closes]

John: What's this about?

[Clears throat]

Well, Rob's gonna
come work for me full-time,

as my creative assistant.

Creative assistant? Mm-hm.

Nice title.

You two have been spending
a lot of time together.

Sharing an apartment,
thick as thieves,

out everywhere, arm in arm.

And now you want
to officially work together.

Side by side, in the public eye.

You always wear your hair
so short?

Uh...

Easier to manage.

"Easier to manage."

Miss Crawford,
let me tell you something.

Whitney is daddy's girl.

Always was, always will be.

Nothing comes between us,
you understand?

Yeah. Yes, sir.

She's my Princess,

and we're building
something here.

Something that you
will have no part in.

Now, here's what I want.
You want my blessing?

Hmm?

Go out on dates.

With young men.

Daddy, with boys?

Be seen in public
and photographed with young men.

Wait, Mr. Houston,
are you serious?

You don't ever have to ask me
that question again.

Well...
I'm not gonna do that, so...

Well...

That tells me
just about everything

I need to know now then,
doesn't it?

Daddy...

You want me to approve
of you hiring this girl,

who has no experience
in management whatsoever? Hmm?

Do you have any experience
in personal management?

No.

Well then, you get out there,
baby girl.

You get out there,
and be seen with young men.

You hear? Go on.

Jermaine: â™ª if you say â™ª

â™ª my eyes are beautiful â™ª

â™ª if you say â™ª

â™ª my eyes are beautiful â™ª

â™ª if you say my eyes â™ª

â™ª my eyes are beautiful â™ª

â™ª it's because â™ª

â™ª it's because â™ª

â™ª they're looking â™ª

Chemistry with Jermaine.

â™ª At you â™ª

Watch your needles.

Robyn: You slept
with Jermaine Jackson.

You're just gonna sit here
and tell me

you slept with Jermaine Jackson?

Rob! Huh?

Rob, it's just a guy. What, it's just a...

It's just a guy?

You know what, I don't know what
you're so upset about.

Just a guy! We agreed we had to see guys.

We didn't agree to screw them! Rob!


Do you love him?

Do you?

He loves me, but I'm not sure.

Rob. That's what it is?

I'm sorry. It took you no damn time!

Rob, I'm not cleaning
this shit up. Robyn!

You know what? Fine.
Smash everything.

It's all crap anyway.

I hate you so much right now!

Yeah? Speak up,
Rob, I can't hear you.

And you know what?
You know what?

Hey, not the vacuum cleaner!
Are you crazy?

Yo, think about it. How are we
gonna clean this place up?

Shit, you crazy, Robyn.

You crazy. Yeah?

So that's it?

Just like that?

I want a family.

A husband. Kids.

Faith and family.

I love you.

We love each other. Right?

Huh? And the Bible says...

Oh, my god. The Bible! No, no, no.

Leviticus... you know, we can go
to hell for this kind of shit.

I don't want to go to hell.

Yeah, I'm not
in such a hurry myself.

Yeah, well, look it up.

Look that up.

[Robyn breathing shakily]

Hey.

I love you.

In perpetuity,
throughout the universe.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I need my best friend.

Rob, please.

Please.

[People chattering indistinctly]

[Over speakers] â™ª it's the
light of day that shows me how â™ª

[Crowd cheering and clapping]

Thank you much!

And good night!

Dj: Well, it's a criticism I
increasingly hear from callers.

Whitney:
That I'm not black enough?

No, your music.
Your music isn't black enough.

What would you like me to say?

The truth.
Aren't you selling out?

Whew.

Whitney: You've got a
lot of nerve asking me that.

That's what my mother tells me.

It's a valid question.

A common criticism of you
and your music.

That you're a sellout.

That you're not
a real black artist.

You're about to walk
out, aren't you? No.

You'll be walking out
before I will.

How do you respond?

If I'm not a black artist,
what am I?

You tell me.

Look, I don't know
how to sing black,

and I don't know how
to sing white either.

I know how to sing.

Music is not a color to me.
It has no boundaries.

Why somebody gotta say
something dumbass like that?

I mean, who said that?
That's just bull.

And it makes me angry, actually.
It's hateful and uninformed.

Why I gotta be what someone
wants me to be anyway?

Sing what I want to sing.
Be how I want to be.

Reach as big an audience
as I can.

Isn't that what art's
meant to do?

My whole life,
"she ain't black enough.

She ain't white enough."
Well, how about,

"she's not obedient enough"?

How about,
"she ain't fearful enough"?

Hm.

Hm.

Well, you heard it from Whitney
herself, ladies and gentlemen.

Was that too much? Hell no.

All right.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Movers chattering indistinctly]

Morning, Max.

Mr. Houston.


Look at this.

Here you are. Good morning.

Thank you.

Use it wisely.

Anna.

Interviewer:
Are you a businesswoman?

Yes, I think so.

What does a businesswoman do?

Well, what does
a businesswoman do?

She says what she doesn't want.

Good morning. Whitney: And she knows,

primarily, what she wants.

That's a pretty tough thing

to have to determine sometimes,
you know?

Most of the people
that work with me,

the people I have known
for many years,

you know, they're people,
competent people

I can trust to look out for me
and to do their job well.

But it's hard sometimes
to make the transition

from being the friend
to the boss

or from the boss to the friend.

Or from the daughter to the boss
or the boss to the daughter.

You know, you have to wear
different hats at times.

So, you are a tough cookie?

Sometimes.

Always? Not always, no. Sometimes.

That means sometimes.

Daddy, what is it?

I want you to fire her.

Robyn is a nobody.

The Bible tells us,
"do not be misled.

Bad company corrupts
good character.

Walk with god, not the devil."

Daddy... I need her gone.

Daddy, there is nothing
going on.

She is a bad influence.

And the press
is talking too much trash.

It's damaging the brand.
Do you understand?

Since when...

[Door closes]Since
when did your little girl

become "the brand"?
I missed that.

Your mama would have killed
to become a brand.

We just couldn't get her there.

I'm not firing Robyn.

I need her. I need somebody
I can trust 100%.

You can trust me 100%.

Or you better damn do.

Now you go do as I tell you.

I'm the manager here.

I know you are. You work for me.

You don't say.

Daddy...

I do.

How is that, to become the boss
of your own family?

Of your brothers
and their wives?

Of your own father and mother?

Or are you still
the "little girl" sometimes?

Sometimes.

Martin: Now, look here,
you stupid, little broad.

Don't you talk to me like that.

I'll talk to you any way I like.

You know who I am?

You think I let dames
get away with anything?

Clive [over phone]:
Yes? Clive, I wanna do a movie.

What?

A movie.

Why?

We'll find you a movie. Sure.

Okay. Night.

Martin: You didn't ask but you
wanted. I did my share. What about you?

Who do you think you are,
you can be so particular?

You're nothing.
You get funny with me,

and I'll throw you right back
to that crummy dance joint

where I found you.

[Camera shutters clicking]

How are you feeling? Here she comes.

Whitney!

There she is.

Whitney "whitey" Houston!
Whitney "whitey" Houston!

Pay no attention. Come on.

Shame on you! Shame on you!

Whitney "whitey" Houston!
Whitney "whitey" Houston!

Who was that? I don't know. Come on.

No, I don't wanna talk
to nobody.

Mrs. Houston! Just stay focused.

Keep it together. What's going on?

Announcer: Give it up

for Bobby brown, everybody!

Bobby: â™ª yeah, do it like this â™ª

Is this an awards show?

â™ª Yeah, get busy â™ª

My god.

[Crowd cheering and clapping]

The amazing Bobby brown,
ladies and gentlemen.

Bobby: Thank you. Thank you.

Woman [over pa]: Ladies and
gentlemen, please take your seats.

The show will be back on
in five minutes.

Whitney: Girl, I swear to god.

Right there. Yeah! Right there?

And I'MMA do it again.

Oh.

Hey!

Girl, I swear to god.

What the...?

What are you doing?

Yo, I'm not even
playing around, man.

You better chill. I'm not.

Hey, hey, hey. What's up?[Laughs]

Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I'm really sorry.

You're Bobby brown, right?

Yeah. Yeah. What about it?

I got a question for you.

And what's that?

How old are you?

Old enough.

He's old enough.

He's old enough, you know.
He's old enough.

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

our host, Anita baker.

She looks so good. So good.

The nominees
for the best music video are...

Janet Jackson, "control,"

Michael Jackson,
"the way you make me feel,"

Whitney Houston,
"I wanna dance with somebody,"

whoo![audience booing]

Jody watley,
"looking for a new love."

Are they booing me? And the winner is...

The winner is Janet Jackson,
"control."

Keep it together.

Hey, hey. Don't even worry
about it.

You're Whitney Houston.
All right?

They dogs.

Give me a pen
and a business card.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Janet speaking indistinctly]

John: You got to be prepared.

You know, the kind of success
that you're enjoying,

that the black stations
ain't got no control over

and they don't own,
it drives 'em crazy.

Oreo. They calling me an oreo.

If they wanna see black,
I'll show 'em black.

No, you don't.
Don't you go changing nothing.

You keep on doing
what you doing,

'cause what you doing
ain't nobody ever done before.

The first one over the hill
always gets whupped.

And you are the first, Princess.

No one is like you.

Look at me. That's right.

No one is like you.

You got class. You can sing.

Mommy, I never wanna
show my face again.

What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

You will show it again.
You gonna show it even more now.

John: To nippy. To nippy.

To nippy. To nippy.

Nelson Mandela
to be released tomorrow.

And as you might expect,
that is a moment

that this country
will not soon forget.

Whitney: I've been thinking
we should get new writers.

A new sound.

R & b.

Yeah.

You know,

L.A. Reid and babyface

are doing some really
interesting stuff right now.

And they might be right
to produce your next album.

We can look into that.
You want to?

Okay.

Don't be sad. Come on.

That's better.

Now get out of my chair.

Reporter: And here they are,

Whitney Houston and Bobby brown.

They're just arriving here

at the billboard music awards.

She's nominated
for four awards tonight,

including top r & b album
and top r & b artist.

Do you want a hug?

It's okay, baby. It's okay.
Thank you so much.

Hi, Whitney. You and Bobby are
the king and queen of r & b.

How does that feel?

It feels very good.
It feels very good.

Y'all wanna see a kiss?

Baby, you look so good.

Beautiful. Beautiful, Whitney.

Just one more.Beautiful.

Look this way. Here, Whitney.

One more. One more time. Whitney, here.

Whitney, turn around. I love it.

All right. All right.

Everybody, back up.
Everybody back up, all right?

Yeah, back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

All right? Back up!

Back up!

Come on. All right. That's it, all right?

We done. Thank you. Thank you.

â™ª ...hurts so bad
yes, it does, yes, it does â™ª

Oh, god, no.

"Why does it hurt so
bad"? It's a great song.

"Why do I feel so sad?

Thought I was over you,
but I keep crying,

'cause when I don't love you,"
blah, blah, blah.

Why? I have to believe
in what the song is saying

if I'm gonna sing it right.

Right? Yeah. No, I understand that.

Right, so no man could have
that effect on me.

I would drop him first.

What?

These are completely
universal human emotions.

I just think you're very young.

No? No.

All right.Next.

Then let's find a song
that isn't about love.

Oh, there aren't any.[Laughs]

Hear me out.
That's all I'm trying to...

All right, I'm listening.

What do you want? Do you trust me?

Yes, I trust you. All right,

so hear me out when I say...

Bobby ain't the one. Bobby a ho.

He a ho. He got a baby
by some chick.

You call my man a ho?

I'm just saying. Uh-uh, no. Relax. Relax.

Bobby's got a reputation.

I know.

You like that bad boy shit?

Yeah. I do. You ill.

[Both laughing]

No, man. He gets me.
He makes me laugh.

And, you know, I'm tired
of being the good girl.

My career casts a lot of shadow.

He's famous enough to get
with that, so I'm good.

All right. Well,
if you like him then...

I'll tolerate him.[Phone ringing]

Thank you.

Hold on one second.

Hello?

Like I tolerate what's-her-name?
What's up? Shh.

My bad. Look, I'm at work. What's her name?

Can I call you back?
Girl, tell me her name.

Her name is Natalie.

Natalie, I'MMA call you
back, okay? Hi, Natalie!

I'll talk to you. Have a
good day. Yeah, bye.

Really? Why would you do
that? Have a good day! Goodbye!

Because. You're rude.

At least she ain't
no Jermaine Jackson. Yeah.

Why you gotta be like that?
You went from Jermaine to Bobby.

Why you gotta be like
that? I'm just saying.

You sure know how to pick
'em. What? Relax. Relax, man.

It ain't like we getting
married or something like that.

[Whitney Houston's "far enough"
playing on radio]

What is it?

Hold up, girl.

Hold up. Hey. Hey.

Hold up, hold up, hold on. What?

Yeah. Yeah, of course you can.

You want that? Yeah.

You got it. Absolutely.

It's just, uh...

It's just one thing.

Kim is pregnant.

Besides that, we cool.

Just wanted to let you know
that so we... we're good. Right?

Honesty all the way.

Man, I love you so much, baby.
I knew you'd understand.

Yeah. Hoo.

That's a fucking load off.

I've been holding on to that
for months now.

The hell you just say?

I just had to be honest
with you.

You messing with me.

I had to tell you
that one thing.

You messing with me. Bobby,
you better be messing with me.

Besides that, we're cool. Kim?

Yes, Kim.

Kim is pregnant? Yes.

Look, it was alcohol.
Lots of it.

It kind of just happened, baby.

No. Stop the car.

Stop the car!

Hey, driver, don't stop
the car. That's bullshit.

Hey. Stay right here.Bullshit.

That's bullshit. Whitney!

Whitney!

Hey! Stop! Whitney!

Will you stop? Goddamn it.

And this happened after we
started seeing each other?

No, it was in
the transition phase, baby.

Look, I was over her.

Not so finished you weren't
still banging her, you mean.

Hey, look.[Honking]

We're walking here! We're walk... idiot!

Baby! Baby!

So let me get this straight,
Bobby brown.

You ask me to marry you,
wait till I say yes,

and tell me
your goddamn ex-girlfriend

Hey, look, I love you.

All right?

I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

No one else.

I didn't know that then,
but I do now.

See, me and you,

We from the 'hood.

Yeah, I know you.

You don't, for one second,

Not for a second.


Hey, look, look.

Against the world, baby.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

So, are we doing this, or what?

Yeah.

Hey, good.

You had me worried

I had you worried? Yeah.

Hey! Bring the car around!

Hey, yo, yeah!
Bring that car around, homey.

Shut up, Bobby!

[Liquid pouring]

[Door opens]

Robyn: Hey, nip.

Bobby: So do we.
You're right on time.

Bobby: Check it out.

Congratulations.

Bobby: Yeah.

Whitney: Thank you, girl.

Bobby. Hey, thanks, Robyn.

Bobby: So, what brings

At the super bowl.

Wait. Hold up.

Bobby: Like, the... Whitney: What, like...

Super bowl, super bowl?
Super bowl, super bowl?

Pilot: Captain, we are airborne.

Twenty-six thousand to push
point. How are we looking?

Coordinates 3016 for uncorrected

super bowl elevation
of 35 meters.

Commentator: Almost

where the giants get ready
to take on the buffalo bills

for the ultimate prize
in football.

No.

Slower, rickey. Please.

What? It's the national anthem.

I think the NFL's
gonna want it fast.

I want it slow.

Just do it.

I have a range of different
looks here to choose from.

Nuh-uh. No dresses.

Girl, this is the super bowl.

Can't I just be me for once?

[Exhales sharply]

[Press clamoring]

Two and three should widen out.
Let's pull back.

Oh, yeah!

Where she from? Yeah, yeah. New Jersey.

So, Whitney was number one
on the billboards.

â™ª O'er the ramparts we watch'd â™ª

â™ª were so gallantly streaming? â™ª

â™ª And the rocket's red glare â™ª

â™ª the bombs bursting... â™ª

Yeah. Yeah, hit that.
Yeah, hit that.

â™ª ...in air â™ª

â™ª gave proof through the night â™ª

â™ª that our flag
was still there â™ª

â™ª o say â™ª

â™ª does that star-spangled â™ª

â™ª banner â™ª

â™ª yet wave â™ª

â™ª o'er the land of the free â™ª

â™ª and the home of the brave? â™ª

Whitney: Mommy. How'd I do?

Are you kidding me, nippy?

You were fantastic.

If you never do anything else
in your life,

you did that
how it was supposed to be done.

Hello.hey.

Okay.

Do you think that you can
postpone your wedding...

For this movie? Why would I do that?

From Nicole. She thinks
it's a wonderful role for you.

I have my concerns.

The bodyguard?

It's about a world-famous
singing star

and her difficult relationship
with her bodyguard.

Nope.

Who's the bodyguard?

Kevin costner.

Did I say no?

'Cause I meant yes.

[Both chuckle]

Well, he wants you.

He wants me? Yes, he wants you.

Do you wanna think about it?

Shit, clive,
it's only a wedding.

Get your priorities in order.
Thank you.

[Whitney Houston's "run to you
[Film version]" playing]

You done back there?

Yeah.


Cut.

Whitney.

Bobby: Hey.

We're gonna have
a lot more babies.

All right?

I love you.

I love you.

I don't know if I can do this
anymore.

What you mean by that?

Be everything.

To everyone.

Well, you can't stop now.

Right?

Hey, I've got you.

[Breathes deeply]

I want you to listen
to something.

We have a minute here, right? Yes.

Okay.

So, I don't feel
that they're allowing you

to sing strongly enough
in this picture

so that we understand why your
character is such a huge star.

Right. Okay?

Do you understand
what I'm saying? I do. I do.

The songs have to be great

in order for the character
to be great.

So Kevin...

Your new best friend,
found this.

Here.okay.

This is Dolly Parton.

[Over headphones]
â™ª and I will always â™ª

â™ª love you â™ª

What?

â™ª I will always love you â™ª

I like it.

I like it.

â™ª If I should stay â™ª

â™ª I would only be in â™ª

â™ª your way â™ª

â™ª so I'll go, but I know â™ª

â™ª I'll think of you
every step of â™ª

â™ª the way â™ª


[Audience cheering wildly]

Whitney! We love you! We love you!

We love you! We love you, Whitney!

[Cheering grows louder]

[Chuckles softly]

â™ª And I â™ª

â™ª ooh, I... â™ª

â™ª Will always love you â™ª

â™ª will always love you â™ª

â™ª you, my darling, you â™ª

â™ª Bittersweet memories â™ª

What?

You think I'm making a mistake.

This is happening, Robyn.

It's what I want.

Okay? Okay.

All right.

â™ª And I â™ª

â™ª will always love you â™ª

â™ª I will always love you â™ª

â™ª and you and you

No, no.
I don't wanna see nobody.

I got you, baby.Okay.

You ain't gotta see nobody,
all right?

Nip. Bobby: You so silly, girl.

What's going on? Great show.Hi.

Okay, you did that.
You did that.

Thank you, girl. Thank you.

So listen... Just give
me a second, all right?

Sure. Let me talk
to you for a sec, Rob.

Yeah, yeah. What's up?

Hey, so, I don't think
nip wanna see nobody tonight.

Yeah, but I'm not nobody.
All right?

Listen, Oprah needs an answer

about you doing
an interview with her.

Word? Word. So we gotta get back.

Yeah. No, I'm good. Hey, hey, hey.

I got this.
Okay, here you go, baby.

No, Bobby. I got this.

No. I got this. So, what you saying?

What I'm saying is
I'm creative director.

This is my job.
I got this. It's simple.

I'm the husband.

I win.Bobby.

All right?


Whit, what's up?

What's going...

I mean, you gotta listen
to my husband, Rob.

What? That's it? That's it.

Yeah, but, Bobby... me?

I gotta listen to your husband?

Bobby, be nice, all right?

Robyn's my best friend. Okay?

Your best friend?

Yeah, you heard her.
Her best friend.

I thought I was that, baby?

No, I need you both.

Okay?

Yeah, all right.

You funny. I married her.

Whatever. I'm going to my
hotel. I'm her husband, Robyn.

[Playing piano]

Hey, whit.


Fine, rickey. How's yours?

I've been working on something
new to finish your show.

But it's big.

I got a show
full of big already.

Mm-mm. Not big like this. What is it?

It's a three-song medley
sung straight through.

Starting with
"I loves you, porgy."

Moving on to
"and I am telling you."

No, don't do that.
Don't do that.

And finishing with
"I have nothing."


What goes through
your thick head

when you're bringing me
this shit?

What?

Those three songs together,

they're almost unsingable
on their own.

Together that's like
climbing mount Everest.

Without oxygen.

And you're the only singer
on the planet

that could pull this off.

That's why I'm suggesting it.

This could be very special.

But, you know,
if it's too hard, I mean...

Let me see.

Come on. You know this stuff.

It's about heartbreak
and the people we need.

Fighting to hold onto them.

What's that? The key change?

It's just a key change.
It's just a key change?

For your big finish.

â™ª Nothing... â™ª

Count of 12.

â™ª ...don't... â™ªsix more.

â™ª ...make... â™ªanother count of six.

â™ª ...me... â™ªthat's only four.

That's a count of 28.

And then you want me to go up? Half a step.

You can take a quick breath
after the "me."

I can take a quick breath?

Try it.

Take me to measure 124.

[Piano playing]

â™ª Don't... â™ª

â™ª Make... â™ª

â™ª Me â™ª

â™ª close one more door â™ªit's not even hard.

â™ª I don't wanna hurt anymore

Mm-mm. Ha!

I'm not doing that shit.
No, you crazy.

You were right there.No.

You're gonna do it
and you're gonna like it.

No, I'm not.

Yes, you are.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Fans clamoring]

I'm your biggest fan.
Please, Whitney.

Whitney, please.

Can I have your autograph,

Thank you so much, Whitney.

Thank you.

Bodyguard: Hey, keep

Ma'am. Thank you.

Thank you.

Well, miss Houston.
We'll see you tomorrow.

Change of plans. Please be
ready to leave tonight.

We don't have approvals.

We'd have to bring in
another crew.

You have my approval, honey.
Whose else do you need?

Your father's, ma'am.

Bring in another crew.
I don't care what it costs.

I'm sleeping in my own
damn bed tonight.

Next to my husband.

Yes, ma'am.

Since when did daddy get
approval over everything?

Girl, try day one.
You just now noticed?

That's my damn jet. Company's jet.

Everything's in
the company's name now.

I wanna see the company
reports, pat.

You got it.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Ma'am.

Good night.


Damn.

Hey, baby? Is that you?

Shit.

Wasn't expecting you home

Don't touch me.

What? What is all that?

What?

Yeah, you got something
you wanna say?

About what?

Damn, whit.

What, I was out?

Yeah. Yeah, I went out.

You bringing dirt into my home.

[Sucks teeth]

I checked.

I don't know
what you talking about.

I checked.

You out here with other women
with my credit card?

I got a problem with that.

So get out of my house.

Nah.

I ain't going nowhere.

I ain't going nowhere.Bobby...

It's my house.

We man and wife, all right?

I'm not going nowhere.
Neither are you, all right?

Get out of my house.
You know what?

Maybe I get the police over
here. You want that again?

Oh, yeah? Yeah.

Or maybe I should get a gun. Yeah?

Yeah, I'm gonna get a
gun. You gonna get a gun?

Yeah, smoke your ass.

You would do that?

Yes, I would do that.

You'll get a gun.
We gonna see about that.

You wanna mess with me?

Huh?

You wanna mess with Bobby brown? Yes, I do.

Yeah? Mrs. Brown? Yeah.

Don't you ever talk to me
like that again, whit.

All right? Get your finger out of my face.

Mrs. Brown, right? Don't touch my face.

You wanna mess with me,
Mrs. Brown?

Don't touch me like that.
Get off me.

We don't want you here!
I ain't going nowhere!

Get out of my house!

Give me my baby. This is my house too!

Give me my baby. Yes, ma'am.

I'm not going nowhere.

Tripping.

Hi. I'm sorry.

â™ª Jesus loves me, this I know â™ª

â™ª for the Bible tells me so â™ª

â™ª little ones to him belong â™ª

â™ª they are weak
but he is strong â™ª

I love you, baby.

I'm ready.

â™ª Why does it hurt so bad â™ª

â™ª why do I feel so sad â™ª

â™ª thought I was over you â™ª

â™ª but I keep crying
when I don't love you â™ª

â™ª so, why does it hurt so bad â™ª

It's been eight years,
during which we've...

I've.

You have only released
seven pop songs...

But not a single album.

I've been acting.

I know.
Three wonderful pictures.

And performing. And tours.
But I'm just pointing out...

Yes. See, you smoking,
that's like...

For me, that's like leaving
a stradivarius out in the rain.

Well, you have
everything, clive. What?

Children, wife.Ex-wife.

Servants, houses.

Oh, it's so hard. I know.

I'm carrying everyone, clive.
The press is always on me.

It's exhausting. Are you exhausted?

Yes, I'm exhausted.
All black women are exhausted.

It's just most of the time,

all this Princess
be dreaming about

is being at home with my baby
on the couch.

I need my daughter
to have the home she deserves.

How can she when her father
is Bobby brown

and her mother is me?

Well, family is the most
important thing.

But that's why it's good,
you know,

when you travel, you take
Bobbi Kristina with you.

I'm not so sure.

What do you mean?

She sees everything.

Everything.

The road is no place
for a child.

Oh, god.

Here. Thank you.

Do you remember that song?

The one I turned down.

[Humming tune]

Yes, yes.

Yeah, I think I get it now.

â™ª Bad â™ª

How about that?

John: And the other one
says, "well, yeah, well,

that's what my sister does,
and she owns all of those cars."

[Men laughing]

Whitney.

Can I speak to you, please?

Sure, have a seat.
I would like you to...

Daddy, alone.

Do you mind? Thank you.

Man: Certainly, miss Houston.

My daughter loved cinderella.

John: What is it, Princess?

Sit down.

Daddy...

My money.

I trusted you.

Look, there's more coming,

and I'm taking care of it.

Oh, you taking care of it?

You taking care of it
pretty good.

I earned millions.

Tens of millions!
Do you even know what's left?

Now, you just watch your tone.

And sit your ass down.

Sit down!

The mink coats...

The cars...

The private jets for everybody,

the credit cards, condos.

Everyone is using me
like an atm.

Daddy, you were meant
to look out for me.

That's exactly what I'm doing.

No. No, daddy.

You put me
in a really bad situation.

I don't know
how I'm gonna fix this.

I'm fixing it.

No. No, you're not.

I don't trust you.

You see those men over there?
Hmm?

That's arista records.

Now, I'm working on a real big
deal, so you just keep singing,

and I'll take care of the money.

I'm gonna have to go
on a world tour.

A huge-ass world tour.

Your voice can handle it.

I'll cut this deal,
and we'll be fine.

So you just keep singing,
all right?

When I land this thing,
you'll see.

I'm still the boss.

I don't have a boss.

But I do have a vacancy
for a father.

Maybe you wanna apply for that.

Whitney, can we get a picture? No.


Whitney: Clive? Uh...

Who is it? Whitney: Come on.

You know it's me. Come on.

What...?

Hi.hi.

Hello. What are you...?

I couldn't sleep.

Yeah, obviously.

And I knew you would be up.

So I was wondering
if you had any.

Any...?

Songs. You know?

Oh, songs.

Empowering songs.
Something I can...

Yes, all right.

Well, yeah, a few came through.

Yeah?

You know, if you can't sleep... yeah, yeah.

You might as well be
working, right? True.

So, you have any?

Do you need anything?

I was just, you know...

I was just wondering
if you had any, you know?

Something I could...

All right. Yeah, well,
I did hear a few today.

That I thought were good.

All right. Well, great.

Okay, well, play me
the best one.

The best one? Yes, the best one.

Okay. Is it empowering?

Well, I thought it was.

But you be the judge.

Okay. Here we go.

â™ª Friday night â™ª

â™ª you and your boys
went out to eat â™ª

Do you wanna hear it again?

Okay.

â™ª Friday night â™ª

â™ª you and your boys
went out to eat â™ª

[Both chuckling]

Okay, let's play it
a few more times.

No, I don't need that.

I got it.

What do you mean,
you got it? I got it, clive.

Unbelievable.
You're unbelievable.

â™ª Friday night â™ª

â™ª you and your boys
went out to eat â™ª

â™ª then they hung out â™ª

â™ª but you came home around 3
yes, you did â™ª

â™ª if six of y'all went out... â™ª

â™ª Then four of you
were really cheap, yeah â™ª

â™ª 'cause only two of you
had dinner â™ª

â™ª I found your
credit card receipt â™ª

â™ª it's not right but it's okay â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna make it anyway â™ª

â™ª pack your bags up and leave â™ª

â™ª don't you dare
come running back to me â™ª

â™ª it's not right but it's okay â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna make it anyway â™ª

â™ª close the door behind you
leave your key â™ª

â™ª I'd rather be alone
than unhappy, yeah â™ª

There you go. Good! Oh, my god! Beautiful!

Okay, then, new album? Beautiful!

I don't see why not.

Okay. I don't see why not.

Oh, um, and daddy wants me
to do a world tour.

What? Yeah. Seventy dates.

Seventy? No. Whitney, no.

Your voice. No.

Clive, I miss it.
And daddy said I can do it.

Well, I'm gonna talk to daddy.

"Let your light shine
before others

that they may see
your good deeds

and glorify your father
in heaven."

Gospel of Matthew, chapter five.

"Don't push your luck,

or you might fall
and break your tuchus."

That's the gospel of clive,
chapter one.

Clive, you're Jewish.

So was Jesus.

At least on his mother's side.

[Door closes]

[Whitney Houston's
"I'm every woman" playing]

[Whitney vocalizing]

â™ª I ain't bragging â™ª

â™ª 'cause I'm the one â™ª

â™ª just ask me â™ª

â™ª ooh, and it shall be done â™ª

â™ª and don't bother â™ª

â™ª to compare â™ª

â™ª I've got it â™ª

â™ª oh, yes â™ª

â™ª oh, yeah â™ª

â™ª I've got it, got it
got it, yeah â™ª


â™ª I'm every woman â™ª

â™ª I'm every woman â™ª

â™ª I'm every woman â™ª

â™ª every need, baby â™ª

â™ª I'm every woman â™ª

â™ª oh, I want you to know now
baby â™ª

â™ª I'm every woman â™ª

â™ª I'm not in no hurry â™ª

â™ª we can fly all night, baby â™ª

â™ª it's your move, so baby â™ª

â™ª baby, let's fly â™ª

â™ª whatever you want from me â™ª

â™ª I'm giving you everything â™ªâ™ª everything â™ª

â™ª I'm your baby tonight â™ª

â™ª you've given me ecstasy â™ª

Who is it?

Baby. Baby. I missed you.

I missed you too. Oh, my god.

â™ª I'm your baby â™ª

Reporter 1:
Bobby brown arrested yesterday.

Reporter 2: On the heels
of winning her sixth grammy,

Whitney Houston stood by her
husband in court today,

who was arrested
for violating probation.

Despite all the problems

Houston and brown
have encountered,

his stint at a rehab clinic

and rumors of his
entertaining other women,

the couple insists they are
still very much in love.

Well, this is cissy Houston.
Tell nippy, Whitney,

Ms. Houston to call her mother.

Behind her closely
guarded facade,

the wholesome singer's life
is in turmoil.

Assistant: Hey, Robyn.
Whitney's a little tied up right now,

but she says she'll see you

when she comes back
from the tour.

â™ª I get so emotional â™ª

â™ª every time, every time â™ª

â™ª think of you, babe â™ª

[Music muffled]

â™ª Love can do â™ª

â™ª ain't it shocking
what love can do â™ª

â™ª tell me, ain't it shocking
what love can do â™ª

Fans: Whitney!

Everybody get back.

Why'd you cancel the show,
Whitney?

Are you high right now?
Have you lost your voice?

What happened to your voice?
Hey, Whitney. Are you high?

Hello.

Come on.

Hey.hello.

Hi.hi.

Hi.hello. How you doing?

I'm okay.

I'm okay. Nice to see you.

Hello, sweetheart.

How are you? Come on in.Good.

Come on in.

How was the trip? It was good.

Was it? Good.Yeah.

Where's the dog?

What dog? The dog.

She's been talking about
your dog for the longest time.

I don't have a dog.

You don't?[Laughs]

Hey, marble. Look what he's got.

Come on, marble.
Go get the dog, marble.

Go get it. There you go.
There you go.

Bobbi:
Marble, come back! Come back!

Cute guy.

Who is he?

I'm an open book, Whitney.

Yeah. Mm-hm.

Yeah, that you need
damn strong glasses to read.

Boy. I did not see that coming.

Well, that makes two of us.

Come here and sit with me.

And I want you to be happy too,
my dear friend.

Okay? Yes.

So the real reason that
I asked you to come up here.

Dear Whitney, the time has come
for me to tell you... mm-hm.

That you need rehab.

Okay?

The number of problems
that are arising

indicate that you're not
gonna win this battle.

And that you're underestimating
the lethal power of drugs.


Do you hear me?

I thought you didn't meddle

in the personal lives
of your artists.

Before you, in entertainment,

whether you're a Judy garland
or you're a Janis...

They end up losing.

You can't do it yourself.

You can't.

And how sad, I mean...

For you to affect your voice...

To affect everything.

It's criminal. I'm fine.

Really, I am. You know, I
got it under control. Mm-hm.

I just need to let my hair down
sometimes. Can't I do that?

You see these?

You're on the cover
of every one of them.

And no longer for your
music. I beat the Beatles.

I beat Elvis.

I was the first black,
all-American,

white-friendly girl.

But that ain't me.

Clive, I gave up a lot.

I know. I know.

But... I can't leave it
this way.

This is a matter
of life and death.

You need to let me help you.

Meddling.

Deal with it. Now.

You know...

Some of your favorite
performances of mine...

I needed help.

To sing with the gods,
sometimes you need a ladder.

No, Whitney.

From the first time
that I saw you...

I knew you didn't need a ladder.

The gods were already there.

Mommy. I want a dog, mommy.

Hey. You want a dog?

You want a dog? You can have
anything you want, baby.

Anything you want.

Whitney.

Clive.

â™ª When all of my dreams â™ª

â™ª are a heartbeat away â™ª

â™ª and the answers
are all up to me â™ª

â™ª just give me â™ª

â™ª give me one â™ª

â™ª one moment in time â™ª

â™ª when I'm racing with destiny â™ª

â™ª then â™ª

â™ª in that one moment of time â™ª

â™ª I will feel â™ª

â™ª I will feel â™ª

â™ª I will be free â™ª


â™ª I will be â™ª

â™ª free â™ª

Robyn: Your show's over.

Bobby:
It's finished. You hear me?

You see what you did?
No. This is what you did.

She's not doing well, Bobby,
and needs to go home.

No, she don't.
I'm running shit here.

Oh, yeah? That's it.

I'm tired of your shit, Robyn.

Bobby, it's clear to everybody

she's not well
and needs to go home.

Come on. Let's get her home.

Yeah? Yeah.

That's what's best.
All right. All right. Okay.

We should...
We should ask her, right?

Let's ask her. Talk to her.

Baby. Baby.

Yeah?

You wanna go home?

'Cause we can. You know
we can do that if we want.

We can always do that.

Do you want to go home, baby?

No.

No.no, I don't wanna go.

Yeah. See?
I'm taking care of her.

That's it? That's it. Yeah.

Is that what you're doing?

Is this what you're doing?

Taking care of her with this?

Is this how
you taking care of her?

You better watch that tone,
Robyn.

I'MMA keep my tone. All right.

Listen, nip. I will not
sit around and watch this...

Anymore.

I'm tired of this, man.Yeah.

Yeah. No, I'm not doing this now.

I'll deal with this later.

Why do I gotta deal
with everyone else's shit?

You right, baby.

You gotta get to that
venue anyway.

Yo. I'm sick of you, Robyn.

And I'm sick of you.

Yo, nip. He doesn't deserve
you, okay? He never has.

This man never deserved you.

Hey, look. Look. Look.
This is through.

It's through, Robyn. Done.

And your dad's in the hospital.

What?

Daddy?

Bobby: Yeah.Yeah. He in the hospital.

Yeah, baby.
I was gonna tell you.

I was gonna tell you
after the show.

After the show.

Yeah. Whatever.
I'm done with this shit.

No.nip, I'm done.

Bobby: Yeah. Rob? Robyn.

[Door slams]

Nurse [over pa]: Lawrence,
regarding a patient on line two.

Lawrence to line two.

Whitney.

Hey.

Hey. Hey, daddy.

You can just leave us.

I'll be out of here
in a day or two. You'll see.

No.

No.

No. Not until the doctors
say you can.

Daddy, you're gonna get
the best care in the world.

I got to get out of here.

Take care of business.

No, you don't.

Not anymore.

Pat's handling everything now.

So you can just relax
and get better.

What are you talking about? Pat?

It's okay.

Pat's managing me now.

You've lost your mind,
little girl.

I've been taking care of
everything. Your whole life.

Who do you think
was looking after you

when your mama was
going off on them tours?

Changing your diapers?

Me.

So, you ain't taking over shit.

It's done.

It's over.

Yeah? What about
the millions you spent?

You blew on Bobby.

Court cases, lawyers,
your private jets.

My private jets,
my money, daddy.

My mind's made up.

Let's go forward.

Then you better get yourself
a good lawyer.

You hear me? Daddy.

And you better pay me
all the money you owe me.

Daddy, what money?

My piece
from that new record deal

that I negotiated for you
with arista.

I negotiated that.

I took care of it.

Okay, like you're taking care
of your new wife

by coming after me?

One hundred million dollars.

There's no one hundred million.

They pay by the album, and I
haven't done any new albums yet.

As of right now,
it's almost all gone.

You let me down, daddy.

And now you're breaking
my heart.

I know you and Bobby
are hiding it.

You get me my money, Princess.

No. No. I'm not your Princess.

I'm not your Princess no more.

Yeah? No more.

Yeah.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Pastor:
We return to the earth...

The body of our brother
John Houston.

How long has it been like this?

Mommy.

[Siren wails]

Hey, baby. Hey, gorgeous.

Everything's fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

Officer: Watch your head.

Hey. Hey, baby?

I love you.

I love you.

James: We're all slowly dying...

But you don't have to
participate so enthusiastically

in the process.

You've hurt yourself
along the way.

Physical damage.

One slipup, Whitney.

Never get a vacation,
you find ways to take one.

Four months.

A private, secure residence.

You'll be closely monitored.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Vehicle approaching]

Baby!

Hi, mommy! Oh, baby.

Oh, my god!

Come on. We gotta kick.

Come on.

Come on. One more time!

Hang on, mom!

Come on! We gotta get
to the wall.

Right. Come on.

Whoo!

We made it!

We made it!

Whoo!

Bobbi: â™ª when I think of home â™ª

â™ª I think of a place â™ªâ™ª a place â™ª

â™ª where there's love
overflowing â™ª

â™ª I wish I was home â™ª

â™ª I wish I was back there â™ª

â™ª with the things
I've been knowing â™ª

I'm proud of you, mommy.

I love you, baby.

Lord...

Give me the strength.

Grant me the strength.

Give me the strength.

Oh, my god,
that's Whitney Houston.

Whitney:
I don't blame you, Bobby.

I don't.

The drugs were there
before you came along.

We didn't help each other,
but I don't blame you for that.

Yeah, shit. I mean,

I wish somebody
would tell the media that.

See...

What I looked for in you
wasn't there.

A home.

Outside of my music,
that's all I ever wanted.

But you broke that.

And I watched my parents
do that to each other

and I promised myself...

Uh-uh.

That's not gonna be me.

All right.

All right.

Look, I... I hear you.

But I still got you, nip.

I still got you. Look, hey...

We can talk this out. Right?

Yeah. Yeah?

That's what we're doing.

We're talking it out.

I, uh...

Goodbye, Bobby. Be well.

Wait. Your daughter needs you.

Wait, nip? Nip?

Hey, Whitney? Baby?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

How's your mama look?

Awesome.yeah.

Go get 'em.

I hope I remember how to sing.

Me too. It's Oprah.

I talked
to the musical director.

I told him to follow your lead.

It's your first time back.
You set the pace.

Thank you, mommy.

[Exhales deeply]

All right. Cissy: You got this.

You got this, nippy.

Remember.

You're my Princess.

Mommy...

You know, I think
I'm just gonna be me.

Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Whitney Houston!

[Crowd cheering, clapping]

â™ª Lost touch with my soul â™ª

â™ª I had nowhere to run â™ª

â™ª I had nowhere to go â™ª

â™ª lost sight of my dream â™ª

â™ª thought it would be

â™ª I... â™ª

â™ª I thought I'd never

â™ª I had no one to hold on to â™ª

â™ª I... â™ª

Always. We'll talk on Monday.

They still love me.

[Clears throat]

Clive, it's my first of the day.

Okay.so...

I wanna do another tour.

I'm a singer. I need to sing.

Well?

Get some rest.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Reporter:
Whitney Houston's comeback tour

is not faring well
for the iconic singer.

Her latest show in Denmark left
hundreds of fans walking out

and asking for their money back.

Woman: It was obvious.

It was quickly obvious that
there was a major problem.

Her vocal range
was seriously diminished.

She was fine
within a certain limit.

But when she ventured
from that safety zone,

she was in trouble.

And Whitney has always been

distinguished
by her range of notes.

Reporter: Houston is one
of the top-selling artists

of all time, with six grammys

and a mezzo-soprano that earned
her the nickname "the voice."

Whitney now needs
more than her...

Go for a shot.

Okay.

Reporter: And Whitney Houston
just arrived at the Beverly Hilton.

Lots of speculation
that she will also perform

at clive Davis's grammy party
later this evening.

Paparazzo:
Ms. Houston, this way!

Are you going back to rehab?

Whitney: Hey, get
them ready to do "home."

Rickey: Does clive know?

Whitney:
Yeah, I'm singing tonight.

I don't think
that's a good idea.

It's not what clive wants,

and it's not
what I want for you.

Did you see me sing on Oprah?

Yeah, I saw you on Oprah.Okay.

I saw you in Copenhagen too.

People wanna see
Whitney Houston.

You set that standard.

I know.

I know I'm not
where I used to be.

But I know how to get there.

I'm not going away.
I can't lose this.

This? This one night?

Yes, yes. This one night.

Me singing for them.

I can't live without it.

I'm gonna be ready.

You need to be.

If you're ready,
I'm there for you, whit.

I always am, but...
If you're not ready though...

Rickey?

Just get ready to do "home."

I'm gonna sing it...

And you're gonna like it.


Do you think this carpet
needs a vacuum?

[Phone buzzing]

Mom, are you nervous? No.

No. No, I'm excited.
I'm so excited.

You know what?

I gotta go downstairs
and get some more honey.

Why don't you go to your room?

I'm gonna get ready
for tonight, okay?

I'm gonna make you so proud.

I love you in perpetuity.

Both: Throughout the universe.

Yeah, that's it.
You got it, baby.

Okay.

Whitney, can we get
a picture, please?

Miss Houston!

Can we take a picture with you? Sure.

All right.

Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much! Okay. Sure.

Whitney.

Do you think I could have
your autograph?

Yeah.

Thank you, Whitney.

Thank you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Whitney:
Can I get a tea, please?

Thank you.

With pleasure.

Would you?

Super, massive fan.

Sure. Ahem.

Oh. Don't worry, I got one.

Spencer.spencer.

So it's true?

You're performing tonight
at that pre-grammy party?

You heard that?

It's out there. Everybody knows.

There's gonna be
a whole lineup of huge stars,

but you're gonna outshine them
all. You always do.

Thank you. Thank you.

Girl, can I tell you something?

Yeah.

I saw you live once, in '94.

The American music awards.Yeah.

I was a seat filler.

Girl, you did
that medley of songs.

Yeah.goddamn.


You liked it?

That's the greatest performance
I've ever seen.

Thank you. As far as I'm concerned,

you're the greatest of all time.

I really appreciate that.
I do. Thank you.


But it was...

It was 18 years ago.

So...

You are just as beautiful
as you've ever been.

And I'm sure you're singing
just as good too.

It's on the house.

[Press clamoring]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

â™ª When I think of home â™ª

â™ª I think of a place â™ª

â™ª where there's â™ª

â™ª love overflowing â™ª

â™ª I wish I was home â™ª

â™ª I wish I was back there â™ª

â™ª with the things â™ª

â™ª I've been knowing â™ª

â™ª Maybe there's a chance â™ª

â™ª for me to go back â™ª

â™ª and it sure would be nice â™ª

â™ª to be back home â™ª

â™ª where there's... â™ª

[Crowd cheering and clapping]

â™ª And just maybe â™ª

â™ª I can convince time â™ª

â™ª to slow up â™ª

â™ª giving me â™ª

â™ª enough time in my life â™ª

â™ª to grow up â™ª

â™ª time â™ª

â™ª please stay, my friend â™ª

â™ª and let me start â™ª

â™ª again â™ª

[Crowd clapping]

Whitney: We're gonna
do a medley for you.

We've never done that before.

It's about love.

The things we do to get it,
and the things we do to keep it.

So I'm gonna sing for you.

With thanks for all the love
you've given me.

And the great,
great joy I've had

in trying to repay that love.
