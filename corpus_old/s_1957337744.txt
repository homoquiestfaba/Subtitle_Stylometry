Today's the third

Sunday of the month!

Movie day!

We are so lucky
that once a month

mama and papi take us
all to the movies!

So what do you
kids want to see?

Tangerine O'Malley's
"Adventures."

Yeah!

Yeah!

Paco wants foreign film.

Maybe next time, Paco.

There's a 1:00 show.

We better hurry.

No te preocupes,
mi amor.

The Lamancha's
a big theater.

There'll be
plenty of seats.

MAYA: I'm taking
the aisle seat.

MIGUEL: Maya, it's my
turn for the aisle seat.

PERSON: Shh.

No te preocupes.

There'll be
plenty of seats!

OK, Paco, I was wrong.

Looks like we'll
have to split up.

Maya, Miguel, you can
take those two up there.

MIGUEL: All right, Maya,
you can have it.

But I get the aisle
next time.

This is going to
be so great!

Maya, I just want
you to know,

I'm so glad I have a sister
who likes cool movies!

[Animal howls]

MAYA: Miguel, stop it.
I need the arm rest.

Maya, you've got
two arm rests.

Hey. Watch it.
Excuse me. Ow.

MAN: Get that pigeon
out of the way!

A good movie.

Shh!


That's it. Paco
calling the manager.

Documentary audiences
never behave like this.

That was amazing!

I can't wait
for the sequel!

I can't wait for the
sequel to the sequel!

Paco prefers documentary.

Me, too!

Hey!

Maya, I have to sit there.
I need the leg room.

Well, I need the window
in case I get carsick!

Rock, paper, scissors?

One, two, three. Shoot!

Paper covers rock.

Two out of three.

One, two, three. Shoot!

Boom, boom, boom.

Booyeah. Yes!

The window is all mine!

Ahem!

Oh.

Three out of five?

Ha ha ha!


Seven out of thirteen?

Bring it on!

Â¡Maya, Miguel, basta!

Â¡Subanse!

Hmm.

Miguel!

Where's my soccer ball?

Hey!

Miguel?

Where's my magazine?

Miguel!

Hmm.

She's always in my stuff.

She borrowed my paints
without asking and finished

all the blue.

He shut down the computer
without saving my homework.

As soon as I need to make
a phone call, she reaches

for the phone.

Hello, Maya.

Hey, Miguel.

Miguel, sounds like you
have a problem!

[School bell rings]

Good morning, class.

I want to remind you that
your western dioramas are due

at the end of the week.

MIGUEL: Maya!
I got here first!

MAYA: I'm stuck!

...partner and don't
save it for the last minute.

Here, let me try
to squeeze out.

Maggie, your
partner is Chrissy.

Theo, your partner
is Andy.

Maya, your partner
is Miguel.

Is everything OK?

Great.

Great.

I was very impressed

with the wonderful
family portraits

you all made.

Look at this one.

Veronica has seven
brothers and sisters!

What a great big family!

And, Freddy, you have
three big brothers.

And here's Tito.

Tito, it looks like you're
an only child, right?

Si.

I only child.

No brothers or sisters?

No, soy hijo unico.

But I have two cousins.

Tio Santiago, are you
an only child?

No, Tito. I have
a brother and a sister.

Â¿Y Tia Rosa?
Â¿Es hija unica?

No, Tito.

Your father is her
brother, remember?

Oh, right.

Maybe I get a pet dog.

What about your goldfish?

Doradito?

He don't talk
or play with me.

He just swim.

Oh. Well, you know,
you're not allowed

to have dogs
in the apartment.

They can be messy and loud.

Like Maya and Miguel?

Well, er--

you know, uh, Abuela Elena
doesn't have pets,

but she has a garden.

She talks to her plants!

Hmm.

And here's the pozole.

Gracias, Mayita.

You are quite welcome.

What is with you two?

You've been bumping into
each other all week!

Santiago, these two
have been bumping
into each other

since
before they were born!

Looks great!

Pass the arroz, please.

Hey!

Ah. Pass the
vegetables, please.

Yummy.

Yummy, yummy, yummy.

MIGUEL: Maya, please!

Pardon me.
Excuse me. So sorry.
Whoops.

Storm's brewing.

Aha. Sorry, Maya.

For me.

Uh!

Hmm.

Hmm.

I'm fine.


Miguel, it's my napkin.

Maya, I took it first.

Aah!

Aah!

Uh-oh!

Someone's in trouble!

Sorry, everyone.


Don't worry, we've got
it all under control!

Maya! I was
cleaning here first!

Ha ha ha!

Ha ha ha!

I think this apartment
is just too small
for you two.

Huh! Â¡Eso es!

No, Maya, we're not going to
do one of your crazy ideas.

But it's perfect!

We'll divide the
apartment in half!

Â¿Dividir el
apartmento por la mitad?

Down the middle.

Miguel stays out of my way;
I stay out of his.

We won't bump into each other,
and we won't ruin each other's

things, and the whole family
will be peaceful and happy!

Maya...

that's a great idea!

Half the apartment for you,
and half for me!

You two could
never do that.

You'd be in each
other's space
in five minutes.

Of course we can, mama!

Â¡Mitad para Maya
y mitad para mi!

When Miguel and I
set our minds to
something, mama,

nothing can stop us!

That's right!

Yeah!

I guess if they
want to try it.

Â¡Gracias, papi!
I'll get the tape.

Oh, you won't regret this!

I think
I already do.

Double trouble.

Let's use this tape to
divide the apartment in half.


Great job, Maya!

Gracias.

PACO: Ahem.

Help, please?

Not so fast, Maya!

Tape!

Oh, come on, Paco!

I need to take
a shower.

Morning, Maya!

Miguel, wait!

Yeeeees?

Well, um--you have to
let me use the bathroom!

Gosh, Maya.

I thought we divided
the apartment in half.

I stay out of your half,
you stay out of mine.

But I have to get
ready for school!

Oh, all right.

You kids keeping
your bargain?

No one's crossing
the tape?

Um. Of course, mama!

We said we could
do this, right?

It's a long story.

Hmm.

[Maya humming]

How was your shower?

Absolutely lovely.

Abuelita was very generous.

It's always nice to feel
clean on a day when it's

raining outside.

Huh?

What does that have to
do with anything?

Oooh. Looks like
a lot of rain. Tsk.

I am sure glad I have a nice
waterproof rain slicker!

I have a raincoat, too.

It's in
the front closet.

Really?

Come on, Maya!

You have to let me
get my raincoat!

All right, all right--but only
because I like you, Miguel!

Gracias, Mayita.

Hey, kids--are you
all ready?

Ah, crossing the
tape already, huh?

Me?

Uh, no.

Maya and I said we would
stick to the deal.

Whoa! Doh!

And we're going to!


You should have taken
the raincoat, Miguel.

I said it was OK!

It's a matter of pride.

MAYA: Hola, Tito.
What's the plant for?

This is my friend.

Your friend?

But it's--it's--
it's a...

Â¡Es una planta!

Si. My plant.

I call him Bravo!

Hmm.

Isn't he great?

Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait,

let me get his raincoat.

Where is your
raincoat, Miguel?

Even Bravo has one!

Don't ask.

Oh.

Ms. Lim, can I please see
my family picture?

Why, of course, Tito.

Here it is.

Gracias.

See? I put Bravo in my
family picture, too!

Uh, Bravo?

Si.

My plant, Bravo!

Oh.

Here you go.
Here's your lunch.

Hi, kids!

MAYA: Hola, mama!

Hey, there's a box of
Gus Lopez's empanadas

in the kitchen.

Gus' empanadas?!

For us?!

Mmm.

Miguel.

Mmm.


Hello?

Oh, hi! I thought
it might be you.

Is it Kylie?

Shh. Shh. Shh.

Maya, if it's Kylie,
I want to talk to her.

Chrissy said you were
coming to dance class.

Miguel?

You want to talk
to Miguel?

So sorry, Kylie,
but Miguel can't, um,

well, he can't get to
the phone right now.

OK, sure,
I'll tell him. Buh-bye.

That was Kylie.


Cheery chipper
cupid sisters!

MIGUEL:
Oh, not again.

GIRLS: Time for action!

Oh, hey. Ha ha!

MAYA: Miguel!

MAN ON TV: Goal!

I'll get it!

Huh?



Oh, Miguel!

Ha.

That's our boy.

Quite an artist.

Si, mi amor.

So are you guys still
sticking to your sides

of the apartment?

Haven't crossed
the tape once.

Does that mean
that it's working?

We're getting along
better than ever,
right, Miguel?

Right, Maya.

Hey, what's going
on with Tito?

He takes that
plant everywhere.

Oh, that's Bravo.

It's his, um, friend.

Why does he have a plant?

I like meatloaf.

How about you?

So anyway, you guys have
to see our diorama.

We did a Native
American pueblo.

Our diorama!

Our diorama!

We haven't even
started!

And how are we going to
do it on separate sides

of the apartment?

So, ninos, are you
still keeping to
your own sides

of the apartment?

Of course, papi.

Could you pass
the butter, please?

Gracias.

There is one little
thing, though.

One little thing?

Well, see, we're
partners for school,

and we have to work
together to make
something.

What do you have to make?

Ah. Nothing big.
Just a diorama.

A diorama!

A diorama!

Ay! Ay! Ay!
Anything but that.

Come on, papi,
it's not that bad.

Not that bad?

Every year you kids
have to do a diorama,

and every year
it's a nightmare

for all the parents
in the neighborhood.

Uh, excuse me, papi.

Hola, son.

Paco help!

Hey! Hey!

Paco stuck!

Ow! Paco!

Paco?

Give me that!

Paco!

Maya?

Um...

I guess I got carried away.

Those were a few
little accidents.

Besides, we're older now
and need less help.

And you think you can do this
while staying on opposite

sides of the apartment?

Yes!

Yes!

Ah.

Yeah. Uh-huh.

So here's my sketch.

It's an old
mining town.

Â¡Bueno! We can use
real coins for the silver,

and your old trains
for the tram cars!

Great. So how are we
going to make it

if we can't cross
the tape

to be on the same side
of the apartment?

Ohh, good question!

Paco want to help.

Not now, Paco.

It's pretty hard to make
a diorama without being

in the same place.

Paco help.

She said not now, Paco.

If only there were someone
who could help us out.

Paco help.

Paco, please!
I need quiet to think.

Â¡Eso es!
That's it!

Tito can help!

Good gravy!

If I need your drawings,
he can bring them to me.

If you need my research,
he can bring it to you.

What if he doesn't
want to do it?

Are you kidding?

What's more exciting
than helping us?

I can think of
a few things.

Â¡Hola, Tito!

How's Bravo doing?

Oh, he good, Abuelita.
I guess.

Is something
wrong, Tito?

Well, I guess
Bravo is OK,

but he cannot
play with me much.

Tell me, Tito.

Do you sometimes feel
a little lonely?

Maybe like
it would be nice

to have a brother
or sister?

Well, maybe.

Is like Maya and Miguel.

Everything they do, they
have someone to share with.

You know, mijo, sometimes
sharing is not so easy.

But not having someone to
share with is not easy either.

Oh.


Hello?

It's for you, mijo!

Huh?

OK, Tito, could you
bring me more newspaper

from Miguel's
half of the room?

Â¡Si, prima! Yes!

Here, Paco,
you watch Bravo!

What? Rar!

[Tito humming]

Tito, I need
some markers from Maya's
side of the apartment.

You got it!

Tito, tell Miguel
I need the scissors.

Coming right up!

Tito, ask Maya for
the batteries, OK?

Okie-dokey!

Batteries?

Check.

MAYA: Tito, I
need that book!

OK, here I go.

I need the staple gun.

Yes, um,
right on it.

Newspapers, please!

[All talking at once]

Big shot.

Ooh. Too sticky.
I need more water.

Tito, I need your help.

Help!

OK, now go out to the
living room and bring me
the train.

Paco bring train engine.

Bueno. Gracias, Paquito.

Got it, chief.

Tito, I need more water.

Miguel, Paco coming!

Whoops. [Squawk]
Woopsie!

Oh, no.

Paco?
Where's the train?

Paco coming!

Aah!

Paco?

Are you in there?

Paco!

Paco? Paco!

Paco!

The paper mache
is getting hard!

What are we
going to do?

Help, somebody!

Abuelita!
Abuelita!

Â¡Mijos!
What's the matter?

Look!

Â¡Bueno!

That looks just like a Paco
made out of paper mache!


It is Paco, Abuelita!

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.
Don't worry, Paquito.

We'll get you out of there.

I promise.

PACO: Thank you, Abuelita.

Easy. Hold still now.

Just one more second.

There!

Yay!

Yay!


[Cough cough]

Paco much better now!

So, mijitos, do you want to
tell me how Paco fell

into the paper mache?

Um...

Um...

It was sort of
my fault, Abuelita.

It all started when
I suggested dividing

the apartment in half.

No, it was my fault.

I should have said we needed
to find a way to share

the same space.

It's just, well, it's hard
always having to share your

space with someone.

Hmm?

Yeah. I love Maya,
but sometimes I think

it would be so much
easier to be an only child.

Is no so easy
being only child.

Huh?

Huh?

Sometimes I wish I have
brother like you, Miguel,

or a sister like you, Maya.

Oh.

Oh, Tito, I never
thought about it
that way before.

Yeah. Maybe we're luckier
than we think we are.

Yeah.

Aw.

But, Tito, even if you don't
have brothers or sisters,

you still have your
mama and papa,

and you have Miguel
and me for cousins!

Is true.

And you know what?

I think I'm OK
without Bravo.

Really?

Si. I no think I want
to divide my apartment
with a plant!

MAYA, VOICE-OVER: So Miguel
and I took the tape down

and finished our
project together.

Mr. Nguyen loved it.

We even got a special prize
for best team effort.

And Tito realized that
being an only child

can be a lot
of fun, too.

Ha ha ha hoo!

And you know what?

From that day on, we've never
had a single problem

sharing the apartment.

Hey! Miguel!

Uh, huh?

Paco?


Hey! We were
watching that!

That was Bravo's
favorite show.

Ha ha ha!
