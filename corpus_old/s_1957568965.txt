Benjamin Franklin once said,

"Lost time is never found again."

"All the pain, the laughter, the love, the heartaches,"

"all wrapped together"

"in one pile."

They come together in the same bag.

The same box.

I'm still learning.

But one thing I do know is the future is not set.

Not yet at least.

No, you're not listening.

And now, I'm humming. Trying desperately

She's a teen.

She's... She's almost a young adult.

It doesn't matter!

No one, especially our baby girl,

should know anything about that sort of thing.

That,

that cube!

It has power.

But it's not bad.

Who knows why Grandpa wanted her to have it?

We shouldn't be hiding this.

Not from Avery, not from anyone.

It's too dangerous!

Grandpa Flick was crazy!

You know that!

They say that about him,

but he wasn't.

Look, Rache.

The box isn't dangerous.

[wife scoffs]

You keep saying that.

You're not listening to me.

You're not understanding what I'm saying.

You are not listening to me.

We've had this box in the basement

for at least a year and a half.

We shouldn't have that thing in our home, Robert.

I don't care that you're brother gave it to Avery.

Why did they want her to have it?

What if she gets it?

What then?

It's... It's too tempting.

We should at least tell her about it.

I trust Avery to make the right decision.

[children playing background]

Yeah.

Me too.

What were they arguing about this time?

Oh, wait.

Let me guess.

Whatever Grandpa's been talking about.

[children playing background]

It's been

getting a little...

I don't know.

Weird.

I mean, Grandpa

Yeah.

All this talk about ancient power

and stupid box.

It's all they ever argue about.

It's so stupid.

Yeah.

Grandpa wanted to give it to me, but

Uncle Ray wanted to give it to me and tried

and

Mom said no.

And now it's all Mom and Dad can ever talk about.



Aiden?

Yeah.

I'm good.

Hey,

what if

this

Study!


We are doing this

because of these test results.

[papers flipping]

[teacher sigh]

Disappointing, class.

[papers flipping]

Philosophy can seem hard.

But remember

what we talked about.

Truths,

meanings,

and experiences.

And then,

resimplify them.

Confucius once said

that, "Success depends on previous preparation

and without that preparation,

there is bound to be failure."

[papers flipping]

This is failure!

[papers flipping]

And the truth is,

we can fix it

by studying.

And definitely,

not by paying attention to what's going on

outside of the class

instead of what's happening in here!

Right, Avery?

[class laughing]

You really need to stop drifting off

and start paying attention.

[class continues laughing]

[teacher sighs]

This is your last warning.

Understood?

Yes, Mr. Murphy.

Okay...

Let's start with Eastern Philosophy.

So,

we have up here

one, two, three, four, five, six, seven

famous philosophers.

And what we're gonna do

is we're gonna have to figure out

where they are from

or what philosophy they represent.

Blue will be west,

red will be east.

So,

starting off with Socrates.

Where was Socrates from?

Greece?

Greece.

So, what will that make him?

Greek.

Greek philosopher.

There you go.

Where is Greece?

In Europe.

And is that East or West?

Mm-hmm.

Right.

You always do this.

You're turning, swerving the whole situation.

I... Well...

How is she supposed to drink it

if I don't remove the lid?

She has her own hands, doesn't she?

Why are you blaming me, again?

No, I didn't.

Can't wait to come over next week!

Welcome, young traveler.

If you are embarking on this journey

for the first time,

know that this box is no ordinary box.

It comes with a potential to give you

a vision of the future

and has the power to transport you to that future

if you touch the box for too long.

But, be warned...

This power and ability also carries with it

a grave warning.

The power to transport you to that future in time

also means you will be unable to return

to the present.

A power and a warning.

Take heed, traveler.

The choice is yours.

Your future is up to you.

Seeing yourself,

talking to yourself.


Well,

there's a reason for cutting through time.

Space...

...whatever it is.

A reason?

Yes!

A reason.

I was told by a lying sage that

if I ever had to return to my past

and meet my younger self,

that it would only bring myself some trouble.

And...

I remembered...

I've remembered going through some

very hard times.

Life...

Life seemed very difficult.

And I also remembered not wanting things to seem

the way they were.

Wanting the way out.

You're thinking

just forgetting about your life.

Transporting here.

Remember?

But you...

...are the one who can change your life.

Not others.

Future's up to you.

Avery?

Avery, honey, where are you?

Avery, where are you?

I... I have to go

Uh, someone's calling me.

I can't... I can't stay.

I'm not even supposed to be here.

Avery, you must listen to me.

You can't come.

If you do,

you'll change the current events,

you'll alter the course.

Everyone and everything you ever loved...

will not exist.

You can't come, Avery!

So, how's Mom and Dad?

Good.

I guess...

Look, Avery,

I don't mind letting you hang out here.

I'm here for you.

But, is everything okay?


Yeah.

Yeah, everything's fine.

Really?

Because I can tell a fake smile when I see one.

Listen, Avery,

I've had to make some hard choices before.

I remember one time,

this Australian guy came in to the restaurant, right?

Big, buff, Australian guy.

But he was really rude to his girlfriend

and his friends.


So,

right before I took his order,

he stopped me and he said,

[imitating Australian accent] Oy, mate.

Lo quero Taco Bell.


And the whole table was laughing.

At first, I thought it was stupid.


I don't even like Taco Bell.

But then I realized that

he was making fun of me.

Then I got mad.

So,

what did you do?


So,

right before I gave him his food,

I made sure we put the hottest hot sauce

in his burrito.

No way.

Yup.

True story.

He got so red

that his mouth was on fire.


He got up and left the restaurant.


Everybody in the counter was dying.

We were laughing so loud

to a point that the boss came out.

He pulled me aside and he told me

that that guy that I just did that to?

Apparently, he was the new contractor he hired

to renovate the whole building.

No!

Mm-hmm.

So,

what happened after that?

Well,

I got a warning,

but I learned a very valuable lesson that day.

A lesson?

A lesson.

I learned that,

Australian people can't really handle spicy food.


But, no, seriously.

I learned that

my decision to hurt someone else,

only hurt me in the end.

Remember, Avery.

You can't change people,

but you can change yourself.

Only you can change

who you are.

And your future.

So, all these people that bully you in school,

all the people that aren't nice to you,

don't let them define who you are.

Only you have the power to do that.


Anyway,

that's enough wisdom for one day.

Same as usual?

Uh, yeah.

I'll have a torto sour cream and onions.

"Torta", Avery.

It's "torta."

"Torta."

There you go, that wasn't so hard.

Alright.

Let me go to the back and I'll put in your order.

Okay.

Bye, Robert.

"Roberto."

Uh-huh. That's what I thought.

[background music]

Excuse me.

I didn't help but overhear.

Were you talking about bullies?

Uhm...

Yeah?

I know what you're going through.

I've been there, too.

[background music]

Hi. I'm Cavenough.

I'm Avery.

Don't mind him at all, he's not shy.

I was bullied, too.

In first grade,

the kids were calling me weird because

I was doing work faster than everyone.

And I didn't look like anyone in my class.

I was scared to tell my mom.

And shortly after, I had a hard time eating.

And I didn't enjoy doing all the fun stuff that

I used to love to do.

Because I had a darkness inside of me

and at first, I thought the bullying was my fault.

But, one day, I did a brave thing

and I told my mom what was going on.

And she asked me how she could help

and she just helped me turn that darkness

into a big spark to change the entire world.

And now, I go across the country,

making people smile, spreading positivity,

and helping other kids who are being bullied.

So,

don't let those bullies get to you.

Whatever you believe,

you can achieve.

Don't ever let anybody tell you differently.

And remember,

you got this and you are powerful.

Wow, uhm...

Thank you.

Thank you so much for...

you know...

encouraging me and all.

It was so great to meet you.

Any time.

And I'd like to give you this coin

full of positive vibes.

And you can pass it on to someone else

to spread more kindness in the world.

I love it.

Thank you so much.

You're welcome

Bye.

Bye.

we also have something we want to share with you.

[background music]

we're working things out.

Existentialism.

Now...

Class,

what did he say

about how we have the power

to change our future?

Come on, class.

You should know this.

[background music]

Alright, so...

[slightly thrilling background music]

Okay.

Avery?

Life...

Life can only be understood backwards,

but it must be lived forwards.

William Ernest Henley once said that,

"I am the master of my fate."

"I am the captain of my soul."

Basically,

we determine our future.

It's up to us.

Us.

Very well said, Avery.

Very well said.

Wonderful, wonderful. Okay...

So, that takes care of Soren Kierkegaard. And

as Avery mentioned,

William E. Henley.

Next, we have here...

[fading discussion]

[arcade music]

Mia, Shailey.

We need to talk.

Okay...

Okay?

Girls...

Is it true that you've been...

you've been bullying other kids?

You know how we feel about that kind of nonsense.

We've talked about it a hundred times!

I just...

I just can't believe...

Who was it?

Who were you two bullying?

[background music]

[twins laughing]

Look at this loser.

[twins laughing]

[background music]

It was Avery, okay, Mom?

I didn't mean to.

Mr. Murphy told me about your grades, Shailey

And that is another conversation we will have.

Do you understand?

Yes.

And back to Avery,

do you know that Mr. Murphy

said that she was your only hope

in passing that class?

No.

Girls,

it's wrong.

It is not who we are.

We don't do that.

It doesn't matter who you are;

Color,

race,

religion?

It doesn't matter.

Do you hear me?

Did you hear me?

Yes, Ma'am.

You girls

better start treating others with respect.

Do you understand?

Yes.

Mom...

Yes, Mia?

I'm sorry. I knew it was wrong

I promise I won't do that anymore.

I promise.

Me, too.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Y'all need to make it right.

Whatever it takes,

make things right.

And another thing,

go wash your hair so it can be re-braided.

Yes, mom.

Yes, dad.

[background music]

Hey,

how did you know that quote in class?

Yeah, that was so cool.

Mr. Murphy said

that I'm not doing too well in class.

But if I work with you,

then, you'd help me to, you know

get better grades.

Yeah, me too.

Can you help me memorize those quotes and things?

Yeah.

Uh, no problem.

I... I got you.

Both of you.

[background music]

Thanks so much, Avery.

See, Shailey?

Told you she was cool.

[upbeat background music]


I don't think I know anymore.

Tell me there's a reason.

Was there ever anything more?

Have I been afraid to find

what I've been looking for?

It's all a state of mind.

I didn't know

that everything was broken by design.

How beautiful.

It's taken me too long to realize,

it's all a state of mind.

[upbeat background music]

What I used to keep in...

Now, I'm only letting it go.

Finally, I'm seeing

everything I help up too close.

All it took to recognize

what I've been looking for.

It's all a state of mind.

I didn't know

that everything was broken by design.

How beautiful.

It's taken me too long to realize

it's all a state of mind.

[upbeat music background]

And all it is,

we create.

Infinite, figure 8.

Ever in,

we remain.

Infinite, figure 8.

All it is, we create.

Infinite, figure 8.

Ever in, we remain.

Infinite...

It's all a state of mind.

[funky upbeat background music]

[funky upbeat background music]

[funky upbeat background music]

[funky upbeat background music]

[funky upbeat background music]

Nice.

So, what's your next one?

We must develop

and maintain the capacity to forgive.

He who is the void of the power to forgive

is the void of the power to love.

There's some good in the worst of us

and some evil in the best of us.

When we discover this,

we are less prone to hate our enemies.

Martin Luther King.

I like it.

Listen, Avery...

Uhm...

About us being mean to you...

I am very sorry about it.

I...

Doing that made me realize that

I should treat others the way I wanted to be treated.

And the way I treated you

is not how I want to be treated.

Yeah, Avery.

You're not a loser.

And...

It doesn't matter your color,

your race,

your religion,

and how smart you are,

how you dress...

We shouldn't have bullied you because that's

not how we would want to treated.

And I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

I forgive you guys.

And plus,

you've made up.

Badly.

[phone ringing]

Hey, Amy!

Sorry.

Uhm, listen...

We're on our way back home soon.

We got a flat tire.

No problem, Ms. Thompson.

It's a bit cold, though.

Should I get my mom to pick me up?

Oh no, no.

Tell your mom it's fine.

Listen, the house key

is under the clay pot next to the front door.

Go inside and get out of the cold.

We'll be back soon.

Oh, there's food in the fridge,

have whatever you want.

Okay, Ms. Thompson.

Oh, Avery says hi.

She can't wait to see you.

Okay, thanks.

Mm-hmm. Buh-bye!

young traveler.

[guitar background music]


Don't know what to dream,

don't know where to go.

Crashers I cannot bear.

Feeling so alone,

trying to find my home.

What do I do?

Where do I go?

What is my future?

How to be known?

God will make a change.

Find a new way.

Pass down the prizes,

God knows, hold on thee.

I can change the future,

my reality.

When I touched the lives of others,

I'll affect my own.

I am not the same.

I found my way home.

[guitar background music]

[upbeat background music]

It's too late now to turn around and back again.

I made my bed and now, I lay my head in it.

I'm sorry I'm not perfect, but I knew that I wouldn't be.

I guess it's for the best you know the worst in me.

I'm no good at being good,

and I never said I was.

And I feel misunderstood,

'cause Iâ€™m trying hard to love.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My actions, they haunt me.

And I'll never live it down.

I'm no good at being good,

and I never said I was.

You call my bluff.

I won't pick up,

I'll let it ring.

Record your voice so I can listen back again.

And I'm sorry I'm not perfect, but I knew that I wouldn't be.

I guess it's for the best you know the worst in me.

I'm no good at being good,

but I never said I was.

And I feel misunderstood

'cause Iâ€™m trying hard to love.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My actions, they haunt me.

And I'll never live it down.

I'm no good at being good,

but I never said I was.

Do you wanna take me back?

Our love of broken plants.

So we can start again?

Holding down a second chance.

I'm too selfish for that.

I'll let you fall again.

I'll let you know that...

I'm no good at being good,

but I never said I was.

And I feel misunderstood

'cause I'm trying hard to love.

Mmmm..

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My actions, they haunt me.

And I'll never live it down.

I'm no good at being good,

but I never said I was.

[intense music]

Amy?

Amy?

Amy? Are you here?

Hey. We're back.

Rachel.

I thought Amy came inside.

Amy's backpack is right here.
