Fuck off.

Oh. Oh, babe. Coffee.

Molly?

Molly, you see my ring?

Molly?

Ah, shit.

Teddy, turn around and get back in your truck.
Look, can I just talk to Molly?

Take one more step, and I'm going
inside, I'm getting my shotgun.

Angela, you're not gonna shoot me, OK?

Let me just talk to Molly.
Gordon, would help me out here?

Yeah, Teddy, I... I think you should probably go.

Really?

Well, look, I'm just gonna stand here.

I'm not goin' away. I'm just gonna wait
'til Molly comes out, and I hope she does!

Stay away from my daughter!

Hey.

I'm sorry. I didn't know it was...
Well, it was.

Molly.
It's OK. Trust me. I'm alright.

Hey.
Molly, don't you dare go with him!

Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I don't... I...
I can't find my wedding ring.

I'm not coming back to you.

I'm just going home.

OK. Alright.

Alright.

Guess you should get going.

Guy does that to your only
sister, and that's your answer.

I hope you're half as ashamed of you as I am.

Hey.

I'll clean this up.

Motherfucker.
You said it, man.

I was about to fuck him up.
Yeah?

I was about to get up in his face, and...
beat his ass.

And I don't give a shit if it's her husband.

I'm about two seconds from going
to his fucking house, right now.

You want to?

What?
I'm just throwing this out there,

but if you want to do this for real,

I might know a guy who knows a guy. You know?

Shit, man. We gotta go back to work.
Already?

Mm-hm. Let's go.

Molly!

Hey.

Sorry, I didn't think you were working today.

Yeah, I just... I switched shifts.

Why, you... you didn't want to see me?

I don't really want to see anyone.

I think that you should just come home.

Molly, please.
I went home.

Yeah, I know, but what if he...

Here you go.

Would it be alright if I talked to Gordon?

Look, I know what you're thinking,

and I... I got no defense, alright?

I did a horrible thing, man.

But it's never gonna happen again.

And I-I, I know it won't make up for anything,

but I think, if you want, you've
got a right to take a swing at me.

No. That's... no.

OK. OK.

Well, I... I think we should all get
a-get a bite soon, or something.

I'm not gonna hide from this, or anything.

Sure.

Son of a bitch.

What?
Motherfucker comes in here, to my workplace?

Who?
Fucking Teddy.

He's here?

Yeah. He offered me a free shot.

What, at your sister?

On him, you idiot.

So did you take it?

What? No. No.

Why not? What the fuck?

I can't... we're in public.

So what do you want to do?

I want to fucking kill him.

'Cause you know, as I said... I might have a guy.

What do you mean, a guy?

Like... a guy.

Mark, you don't have shit, man.

Because I go fishing with
this guy, who did some time.

He had a cellmate he's always talking about.

He's done this kind of thing before.

Dude, just because you sell fucking dirt weed

to high school kids doesn't mean
you're, you know, on the inside.

You want me to check it out, or what?

Yeah, fine. Whatever.

I got work to do.

Like what?

How was work?

It was fine.

You gonna get paid for that overtime?

I don't know. Every time I bring it up,
they just... I don't know. I'll see.

Not so much, "we'll see." It's just, "no."

I-I wasn't done with it. I'm eating.
Right?

You know, when you let people
know that they can just

take from you and you don't do anything,
that's exactly what they'll do.

Hello?
I got the number, man.

Oh, um...

<i>You backing out?</i>

No. No, I just... I don't have that much money.

I thought you were saving for a truck?

Yeah, I got like, two grand.

So you do got the money.

<i>I got the number if you want it.</i>

Yeah. Yeah, I want it.

<i>Come down to Henry's.</i>

Hey, dude. What's up?

I didn't get you nothing.

Ah, that's OK.

Hey.

You sure this isn't bullshit?

I called my man. He gave me the number.

And the money in my sock drawer's gonna be enough?

You should ask him.

I'm gonna go get another pitcher. You want one?

Yeah, sure.
You got five bucks?

Are you fucking kidding me?

Motherfucker, I just did you a favor.
So, I'm gonna go get 'em. So, yeah.

Fine. But, just... I can't spend any more.
Get the cheap shit.

Well, can't you just have Doris take my shift?

Well, I got the flu. You want me around food?

I never take off.

OK. Sorry.

I'll call you when I'm feeling better.

Let me tell you what we're gonna do.

Tonight you can crash on the couch. That's fine.

Tomorrow you're gonna take
your stuff and move out.

Molly. Molly, I'm... please.
Teddy, it's not even close to being a question.

Alright. Alright.

Alright.

What can I... Let me... let
me just take you to dinner.

Just dinner. Please. Let me start over.

Please, just dinner.

And if... and if I do anything that... that you

don't want... anything at all... I'm gone.

Um, I'll fucking move out of town.

I will, I... you'll never...
you'll never see me again.

Please.

Please, I'll do whatever you want. I'm serious.

I'm serious.

Please? Please.

Fine.

But this isn't some kind of fresh start.

You're not my husband again until I say so.

That's fair. That's fair.

Yeah, it's fairer than you deserve.

<i>Yeah?</i>

Uh, is this-is this Howard?

<i>Who's this?</i>

My name is Gordon. Um, I'm calling about a job.

<i>What time is it?</i>

Uh... I don't know. About 1:30?

<i>Yeah, you're calling me this late?</i>

Uh, I got a contract.

<i>What?</i>

A con... a contract?

Uh... to take care of someone?

<i>How much money you got?</i>

Uh, $2,000.

<i>You want to talk, you come to my place.</i>

OK, I'm in Auburn.

<i>Auburn?</i>
Pennsylvania.

<i>I live at the end of East Rio Street.
Jefferson County, Mississippi.</i>

OK, well, I'll give you a call.

<i>No you won't. You come, or don't.</i>

<i>End of East Rio Street.</i>

<i>You pay expenses, too.</i>

OK. Um... well, I...

So, I guess I'm going to Mississippi.

But... just to talk to him.
He said he would do it?

Fuck, yeah!
Just to talk to him.

You sure he's good?

I'm sure he's cheap.

You wanna grab a drink first?

Dude, we just talked about this on the phone.

I didn't know if you meant it.

Look, I don't mean to be a dick, but
can we please just go to the motel?

Fuck! Fuck!

The store's sending you to Mississippi?

Yes. For work. It's just for the weekend.
I'll be fine.

Hey, there. You ready to go?

Sure.
Alright.

Where do you want to go?

The Grill.

We could go some place nicer.

I like the Grill.
Alright.

We're just gonna see people we know,
and, you know, it's not private, and...

Is that a problem, Teddy?

No.

No. I just thought... you know,
you might want to...

The Grill it is.

Hey, Teddy.
Hey. Hey, Hank. How are ya?

I'm good.
How are you guys?

Good seeing you.

-You know what you want?
Yep.

What can I get you guys?

Hi, Sally.
Hey, Teddy.

Molly.
Hey. How are the kids?

Oh, kids are great.

Y'all know what you're getting?

Yeah, I'm gonna have the chicken
fried steak, and Molly will...

I'll have the spaghetti, with
the, um... meat sauce.

Alright. Anything to drink?
I'm gonna stick with water, for now.

Water.

Yeah.

Can you get me a beer?

Alright. I can handle that. I'll be right back.

Alright. Thank you.

Why'd you get the... the spaghetti?
They don't even do it like you like it.

They don't have the parm... the... the cheese.

I mean, if you want spaghetti, we
can go to a place that does that.

I want the spaghetti here, alright?

Alright. Yeah.

Yeah. Sure.

You do anything fun today?

No.

Fair enough.

Whatever.

You're gonna be alright to get home?

Yep. I'm good.

Well, maybe I could swing by, after work tomorrow?

Maybe bring something by the house, or... or we
could go out again, if... if... if you want.

I got no problem with that.

I'll cook something up.

Is that alright?

What'd I just say?

I guess I'll see you tomorrow, then?

<i>What you want?</i>

Uh, does Howard Blake live here?

<i>Who's that?</i>

My name is Gordon.

Do you know where I can find Howard Blake?

<i>Come on in.</i>

Come on in.

What you want?

Uh... I... I just... we spoke the other day
on the phone about a... potential job?

Why you come around here? I'm
ain't got no work for you.

No, it was... it was about me hiring...
you for a job in, uh, in Pennsylvania?

Oh!

You're the man with the money.

Yeah.

So... how do we... how do we go about doing this?

Take your shirt off.

What's that?
The shirt, take it off.

Oh, no... I don't think you understand.

I... I'm not...
No, you don't understand.

Take your goddamn shirt off.
Whoa, no, no, no.

OK.
Take your shirt off!

Can you please just put that down?
Take your goddamn

shirt off! - Alright!

Shirt's coming off.

It's off.

Pants.

No. Come on, please, sir.
Now! Get them goddamn britches down!

Shorts!

I don't think you...
You don't need to think. Get your shorts down!

Hands up!
Oh, come on!

I'm fixing to put you down with this, here.
OK. OK. OK.

Turn around.

Look, I have the money.

And you'll still have it when we're done.

You look clean.

Put your shorts up.

What the hell was that?

Well, now we both know you ain't wearing a wire.

Cops do that, you know?

Well, you could have just said that and
made this whole thing a lot... easier.

Yeah, well it seemed pretty easy from over here.

Looked like you'd done it before.

No. No.
Calm yourself.

Sit down. Take a seat.

So, what is it you want me doing?

Um... well, I got this brother in law.
Yep.

He's... he's a bad guy. I mean, really bad.
He... he beats up on my sister.

Yep.
I mean, the other day he almost killed her.

So, what do you want me to do?

Well, I was wondering if... you know, you...
you could take care of him?

Oh.

You want me to kill him.

Yeah, well, I would like to
talk more about that, yeah.

How much money you got on this, again?

Um... $2,000. Back home.

Well... let's go get it.

Well, yeah, I mean, maybe we can discuss
it a little more, if... if that's OK.

Sure.

We can talk about it in the car.

Vallego is her girlfriend, and she says...

she says, how did you know?

All I did was drink iced tea all
night, and he didn't hit me once.

And the girlfriend says, she says...

says that that's what happens
when you keep your mouth shut.

Right?

You ain't thinking that's funny
'cause of your sister, I guess.

Well, some people got a sense of humor.

Sorry. Uh... so how long you
been doing this kind of thing?

What, the... the killing thing?

Well... a while.

But... it ain't exactly full time, you know?

It's hard telling how many
fellas want a man dead enough

to pay for it, but not enough to do it theyselves.

And you've done this... you've done
this kind of thing before, right?

For... for money?
Oh, sure.

So, how do we... how do you go about it?

Well, you... you give me your
money, I shoot him in his head.

Ain't like I'm teaching Portuguese, or anything.

No, I just, mean, well, you know, why do..
most people want to do something like this?

Jesus Christ. You keep nipping at my
heels, you're gonna buy me dinner.

Uh... OK.

Those motel walls were so thin, all
I was hearing for a week was...

And he's about to bust his nut, so he's like...
You know how that is?

Oh, yeah, baby.

For a week, man. I'm telling
you, it drove me crazy.

These burgers are fucking fantastic, man.
I'm... I'm impressed.

Mm.

So what do you like to do in Mississippi?

Well, I keep myself company just fine.

Are you from there?

Mm-mm.

Mm.

Born in Utah. Come out here about...
He's a terrible man.

You said that.
I wish I could just do it myself.

Yeah.
I mean, that's moral, right?

If it saves my sister, and... and
he goes off somewhere better?

Refill?

Sure.
And the check, please.

Get that right for you, Hank.

How do you square yourself off
with God with something like this?

Seriously?
Yeah.

Son, if you hadn't figured out that this stuff was

bullshit by the time you'd reached
puberty, I got nothing for you.

You don't believe in God?

Well, what the fuck are you saying?
We just... die, and that's it?

I couldn't live like that.

Yeah, that's great, but it just exists
in your head. Ain't none of my business.

I mean, I got my thoughts, and you have
yours, you know? Who knows, right? So...

I just... I just want my sister to be happy.

Well, whether it's your religion or your sister,

you tell me what you hold close, and I'll

tell you where you're lying to yourself.

You be careful, boy.

What are you looking at?

What?
Not you.

You've been looking over here
for the past five minutes.

You want to tell me why?

I don't like the way you talk about religion.

Maybe you want to shut up.

I don't give a good God damn what you like.

You better put those eyes back in that soup
boy, or you ain't gonna have much use for 'em.

I'll look wherever I want to look.

Yep.

I guess you're gonna.

Look, maybe... I made a big
mistake with this, whole...

What?

Maybe I can just drive you back home, and...
What, cause of that?

No, I'm just, you know, thinking...

Why don't you go outside and bring the car around?

We gotta wait for...
No, I-I'll take care of that.

She'll bring it, we'll square it up later.
You go and get the car.

You ain't comin'?
Meet you outside.

Oh. OK.

Get in the car.

I didn't see you come out.

I got kids.

Oh, shit.

Hey. Hey! Look at me!

Get in the car.

No, no, no, no.

No, no. Hey!

Come here!

You get in the car.

You wanna talk about this, we'll
talk about it later. Get in the car!

Hey, you look... you look great.

I got... I got you these.

Thanks.

Come in.

Tastes good.

You've had it before.

Yeah, I know-I know.

I was just... tastes like you
did something different.

Little bit.

Well... what'd you do?

It's just a new recipe.

Oh.

Well, yeah, it's... it's interesting.

Thanks.

Was it a recipe with poison in it?

I mean, it's like... really, really bad.

It's not good.

I'm sorry.
No, no. No, you tried.

It's just... wow! Uh...

Don't you work in a restaurant?
OK.

Now you don't get to finish.

No. No-no-no. Wait, wait. I'm-I'm eating.
I'm eating.

No. Now I'm embarrassed.

Never cooking again.

That might be smart.

OK. Now you're done.
Wait.

It's alright.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

I know.

I don't... remember the other night.

You know that, right?

I'm not saying that makes it OK.
It doesn't.

But it wasn't me.

Do you know what I mean?

Yes, it was.

So don't forget that.

Wait. Wait.

I can do that.

Sure.

So you got any chores that need doing?
Can I swing by tomorrow?

I'll think of something.

Great.

Hey.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to make you nervous.

It's not that. It...

Well, what? What?
It just hurts.

What are you... what are you... what are you...

what are you doing with someone like me?

Have you lost your mind?
What are you saying?

Holy shit! I... if I saw that on
anyone else, I'd tell them to leave.

So what, you're gonna leave me?

Uh, no, no! Don't... That's not...
that's not what...

Yeah. 'Cause you signed on for this.

You don't get to make that decision.
I already left you.

Molly!
No. I...

I love you so much, and you did this to me.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No. You... you wanted to fix this.

So you're gonna go home to wherever the hell

you're staying... and you're gonna come back

here tomorrow and make it up to me.

And you're gonna do that the next day,
and every day after that, and forever.

OK?

Yeah.

Just go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

Want to listen to the radio?

No. I think I'll just... I
kind of want to just get home.

Well, that's where we are going.

Look, we never really agreed to a...
I'm not leaving my house in

the middle of the night for nothing.

Well, I think I said I kind of
want to just... talk about it.

We were talking about how, not if.
You'd best understand that.

They don't know what we're driving.

And when they find them bodies, they
ain't gonna piece anything together.

They'll just be running around
like retards at the rodeo.

Yeah, um... do you think that maybe we could...
you know, stay at a motel for the night?

I can drive 'til daybreak.

Yeah, well, I kind of want to crash in a bed.

Well, I guess every man
ain't cut out for the road.

Alright. I'm gonna crash out.

Yeah, you had yourself quite a night.

Get yourself some sleep, there.
Yep.

Take a shower.

Wash that shit off the top of your lip.

What time do you want to hit
the road in the morning?

About 10:00.

10:00 it is.

Alright. I'll see ya then.

What?
I'm gonna need that phone.

Well, I don't think you can just...

You gonna give it to me, or you gonna make
me come over and get it? Come on, now.

Your cell, too.

It doesn't even get reception here.
Well, lucky you. You won't even miss it.

Get you some sleep.

Try not to keep yourself up thinking about
all the people done screwed on that bed.

Enjoying the evening?

Can't sleep.

Wanna go curb crawling, or something?

No. I don't.

Then go back to sleep.

10:00 AM. Time to get up.

What?
It's 10:00.

Time to hit the road.

OK. Alright.
Gordon.

What?

I've spent my whole life hand
holding people like you.

But you... you don't know me at
all, and tha... that's fine.

Hell, I might even take comfort in that,

but you best keep that in mind
before you do something stupid.

Now... we're gonna go to your
house and do what you need done.

Or you could just pay me the
money, and I'll be on my way.

Either way, I don't care.

But... you're never gonna be a man in your
own mind unless this thing is finished.

And you ain't doing it yourself.

Now, it sounds like she ain't leaving him.

And he sure ain't leaving her.

So it's up to you.

All you got in your life is choices.

What's yours gonna be?

I want him dead.

Alright.

Get yourself dressed. See you in the car.

Hey, Howard?

Can you, uh, just do me a favor, and...
not kill anyone else until we get there?

Gordon, I don't think that's a
promise I could comfortably keep.

Especially if you keep running your mouth.

See you outside in five.

Hey.
Hey.

Auburn, you say?

Yep.

That's pretty much Penntucky, isn't it?

How cold it get up there?

I don't know. Pretty cold, I guess.

Goddamn, that's gonna do my
joints in something awful.

So what's... what's the plan for
keeping this whole thing quiet?

What's the worry, kid?

I don't know what would happen
if, you know, you got arrested?

Why would I get arrested?

I don't know. You've been caught before, right?

Jesus Christ, you wanna see
my resume, or something?

No. I just know you went to
prison before, so I-I just...

Too chicken shit to do it yourself. How 'bout this?

I want you money, so I'm gonna warn you.

You keep talking like this,
I'll shoot you in the mouth.

OK, I'm sorry.

If you knew how much I felt like putting
you down right now, you'd keep it shut.

I'm gonna get a lemonade. You want one?

A lemonade?
Yeah.

No, Teddy.

I know you've got the wife
thing and all, but I'm not 12.

I don't want a lemonade.

Alright. Well, I'm gonna have one.

Well, hey, can you throw my beers in the fridge?

You're really gonna make me go inside with those?

You gonna want help with the rest of this?

Fuck you, man.

They're not mine.

Do you... do you mind if I...?
Mm-mm.

Well, I think you've still got it.
Oh.

Thanks.

Hello?

<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

<i>We have dinner with your sister and the
son of a bitch. You gonna make it back?</i>

Yeah. Yeah, I'll be home tomorrow.

<i>Yeah? How's the job?</i>

Uh, it-it's... it is good. You know? It...

just fine.
<i>Gordon, I hate when you lie to me.</i>

<i>It makes me think you did
something you know was stupid.</i>

Mom, I'm not lying, OK? I just... I'm... I
can't talk right now. I'm... I'm driving.

<i>Fine. When we get home, we're gonna...</i>

Lying to your mother?

Sinner.

Look, I know you said the whole th...
thing about the mouth shooting.

But...
Doesn't sound like it.

Well, I'm... I'm just kinda hungry.

Wait. Where we going?

You wanna get something to eat,
we can get something to eat.

Well, how do you know there's
gonna be food around here?

Saw a sign.

Well, I didn't... I didn't see any...
I didn't see a sign.

Well, it was there.
Look, I'm sorry. I'll...

I'll shut up, I'll... can
we just please keep going?

No, we're gonna get you something to eat.

Alright, I have the money
waiting at my house for you.

I know.
OK, so

can we please just keep going
and get on the highway?

I didn't... I didn't see any signs.

Gordon, I don't need to lie to you to kill you.

We're gonna get you something to eat.

What?

Are you afraid?

You afraid?

No worrying.

I'm not gonna kill you. I'll just blow
your kneecaps off. How about that?

No-no-no-no-no. No-no.
You need those things, huh?

Do you need those things... huh?

Calm down.

I'm not gonna shoot you.

OK, I'm gonna shoot you.
No-no. No! Fuck!

Hey! Just kidding. Just kidding.

Relax, man.

Why would I kill you?

Why?

You ain't paid me yet.

Oh, fuck it. I'm just gonna do it.

Ow!

I'm just kidding.

You relaxed now?

You relaxed, motherfucker!?

Oh! Hey.

Gonna get you something to eat.

You ain't hungry?

I don't know.

You don't know?

Go on, get something to eat.

That's why we stopped. So you
could get something to eat.

Yeah.
Is there something you want to tell me?

No, I'm... I'm fine.

You can't take a joke, can you?

I'm fine.

God damn.

Am I just gonna get that baby face for...
I was messing with you.

Don't turn into some bitch.

OK. I'm sorry... I'm... I'm
just freaking out a little bit.

I just wanted to talk about...
What?

The whole thing. The... I don't know.

I don't know.

You want me to tell you about my killing.
Don't you?

You been wanting me to tell you
about that since we met, ain't you?

You don't... you don't have to
talk about it, if you don't want.

No, that's alright.

It's OK. Uh... it's fine.

OK, look you... uh... when I was a kid, I
had this golden retriever, named Misty.

I mean, that dog was dumb.

It would bark at the wind if it heard it.

Ah, but she was nice enough.

You know?

It was the winter. It was... I think I was 12.

Someone left some food outside, and a
mountain lion came sniffing around.

And bam, out goes Misty.

And that mountain lion pounced on that dog and
snapped her neck. I mean, just like that.

Out comes my old man, .38 in hand.

Fires the gun. Boom! Bullet
hits the lion in the ass.

It-it... it jumps up, honest to
God, about 8 feet in the air,

does a double back flip, lands on all fours,

and it is gone into the woods,
just like that. I mean a pyow!

I mean... it... next morning, I come out with
my .22 and I'm gonna finish it off, you know?

I look around, not too far, about a couple hundred
yards beyond the road in front of our house.

Lion's there.

Dead.

And it's, uh, its cub is trying
to suckle at it, you know?

Get the last bit of milk.

I come up to close to it, and... it stops, and
kind of looks up at me, with these desperate eyes.

And I shoulda kilt it then, but...
because of my dog,

I thought, well, hell, I'll just let it suffer.

Let it starve.

But then I'm walking home, and I'm
thinking, well, Misty didn't suffer.

She's here, and then she's gone, and
the mountain lion didn't suffer.

A couple hours of pain, and died.

But me and the cub, we suffered the most...

'cause we had to carry that with us.

What I do isn't about the people that die.

It's about the people that are left alive.

They get the short end of the
stick, as far as I'm concerned.

Some of them are blindsided, and some of
them think the ends justify the means.

But there ain't no ends,
as long as there's people.

They gone.

Just doesn't matter.

Yeah, well, I think that...
I don't give a shit what you think.

And don't get on your high horse with me.

'Cause I didn't show up at your house in the middle
of the night asking you to kill a man for money.

Yeah. So I'm sorry.

I just... I'm...

What?

It... It's not like you
still... mourn that dog, right?

What are you talking about?

Just that... there ain't much hope for the dead.

Where's your hope?

I have hope.

I have hope for my sister.

You know, and that-and
that... she can be happy.

She deserves to be happy.

Well, what's his name ain't
gonna get that chance, is he?

Teddy?
Yeah.

No, he ain't.

What you watching?
Sitcom.

Knew he was gonna say that.
Why'd you laugh, then?

'Cause it's funny.

So, I guess you think you're pretty funny, then.

Funnier than you.
Oh, yeah?

Yeah.

Don't get my hair wet.

Sorry.

Thought you were watching that?
No, it's stupid.

Well, it's a sitcom. They're supposed to be.

Oh, hey, oh... go back. I wanna watch that.

Hey, hey, hey, come on. Give me...
No. You can't.

Alright.

OK. Good night.

You aren't coming in?

If that's alright?

Yeah, it's fine.

Just don't push it, OK? We're going to sleep.

Alright.

Don't forget, we got dinner tomorrow
night with Gordon and my mom.

Yeah.

We're here.
Yep.

I need a shower and a bed.

Well, you'll get it. After you go and
get that cash. I'm gonna do it tonight.

What, that soon?
Why not?

I... I don't know. Don't...
don't you have to, like...

scope out the area, or something?
Look for... Injuns?

You go get that money, now.
Yeah. OK.

Um... do you think you want to park here, though?

'Cause my... my neighbors, they
might see something, or...

Well, you'd better hurry up
and go get it, then. Go on.

Well, look who's back from his big im...

Hey! Who's your friend?
Mind your own business.

OK.

You can get your car at the train station.

OK. How am I supposed to get it?

I don't care.

Did you forget something?
I gave it to you.

I gave you the money. It's in there.

Address?

Right.

OK, and how do I, uh, contact you?
You don't.

Did you get done what you needed to do?

Yep.

Why don't you help me clean up?

I'm so comfortable.

Alright-alright-alright-alright. Just don't...
don't move, 'cause I think we figured it out.

Cold! My feet are poking out!
Oh, sorry.

Cold!
Sorry. Sorry.

Mm.

Wait. I don't... no.
It's alright.

You can't make a fool out of me.

OK?

Promise me.

I won't.

I won't. I promise.

You ready?

Guess so.

Smells good, Mom.

Hope it isn't getting wasted.

Mom, do you think you ever lie to yourself?

About, like... things that you care about?

What are you saying?

Nothing, just... you know, maybe you tell
yourself something because... I don't know...

Keep sharp objects away from
me when that man is close.

Let me tell you something. I'm
expecting you to defend your sister.

That is your job.

I got it.

We're gonna talk about this
new attitude of yours, later.

Molly. It's good to see you.

You're looking a bit better.

Come in.

You watch yourself. Alright?

Yes, ma'am.

Hey. What's this I hear about
business in Mississippi?

You're in demand.

Yeah. Not really.

Well, I'm impressed.

Who wants to say grace?

I'd be happy to.

Why don't you go ahead, then?

Um... dear God, we thank you for the food that...

Angela and Gordon worked so hard to prepare.

And may we learn to appreciate the
gifts the Lord has bestowed upon us.

And may we earn... the...
forgiveness of those around us.

When we s... when we make mistakes...

may we learn to... fulfill our duties as men.

You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
Mom!

I wasn't planning on bringing this up.

But you want a conversation of it, I will.

I wasn't kidding when I told you I had a shotgun...

and I'm not gonna use it to kill you...

but if you touch that girl one more time,

I'm gonna use it to cut you off
at the ankles. You got me?

Leave you with two stumps.

And when they get fucking word of what you did...

I'm not gonna be inside very long. And you?

You'll probably get a big
government check every month.

But you better make sure you can make
it to the mailbox in a wheelchair.

I understand.
Oh! Well, thank you.

How very humble of you.

Why the hell are you even here?

I'm sorry. I just wanted to...
You wanted.

Oh! There's something that you wanted?
Isn't that fucking fascinating?

You get this man out of my face.

I'm not here to redeem you, OK?

Get him out of my face. I'm serious.
Get him out of my face!

Hon, can you give us a minute?

Maybe if I just...
It's just... go to the porch.

I need to talk to my mother.

If that's what you want.

Yeah, that's what we want.

You feel bad? Good. You should feel bad.

However bad you feel, you should feel worse!

You go have a smoke outside with him.

Yeah.

So tell me about Mississippi.

It's the same as here.

Gordon... do you think it's
better to do a bad thing

and you know it's wrong, or...
Look, if I wanted to bring it up, I-I would have.

I'm not saying that this is an act. I just...

I don't really care how you feel about anything.

Fair enough.

He really can't wait to get off that hook, can he?

Mom. He's fixing it.

Men always change until you give
them the chance to change back.

So... what? I'm supposed to move back here?

Start over?

I have a life that I like, and there's more to
it than a couple nights that... went... wrong.

You stay... you may never realize
how good life could have been.

Who's got it better?

You?

Gordon?

I don't know what this better life
looks like, but I don't see it here.

You sound like someone who's trying to seem real
reasonable about doing something God awful.

Just like your husband on that one, huh?
I love that you just assume I'm stupid.

Oh, it's not about intelligence, babe.

It's... it's a matter of judgment.

And you're in love with
him, so you don't have any.

Would you please just listen to me, for once?

Ever since you turned 16,
you've stopped listening to me.

It makes sense, I guess. Sixteen year old kid.

Older than her mom was when she was born.

I can't... I can't blame you for
thinking that that made me trash.

And you've been smart, up to this point.

But you cannot have kids with a man like that.

They are all the same.

And I can't approve of this, not one bit.
Not on my watch.

It's not your life.

It's not Gordon's. It's not even Teddy's.
It's mine.

Fine.

Fine. Next time I get a bloody
pulp on my front doorstep,

I don't know if I'm gonna let it in.

You don't have to worry about it.

'Cause I don't want anything from you.

Good! 'Cause you're not getting anything!

Let's go. We're leaving.
You sure?

What?
Oh, yeah.

And fuck you.
Fuck me?

Oh, you're not coming back. Not ever.

Like I would.
Mom.

You stay out of it.

I'm done. I'm done with this house, OK?

Good! I hope you have a lot of cover up.

Bitch.

Leave me alone, will ya?

Just go back inside.

Pull over.
What?

Stop the car!

Uhh! Fuck! I can't stand that woman!

Yeah. Yeah.

Hey. Hey.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

You alright?

Does that hurt?

Sweetheart?

Yeah?

I need something.

What?

I don't know how to tell you.

What? Anything you want, you got it.

I'm thirsty.
Oh, come on.

Oh, come... no.

Yep.
No, please.

OK. OK.

Fuck.

I fed the dog.

Alright.

Fine.

Mm.

Where are my pants?

They're on the floor.
OK.

OK.

Alright, here we go.

You owe me so big for this, OK? You hear me?

Here.

Are you just gonna stand around all
night, or do you wanna come back to bed?

Yeah. Yeah, sure.

Give me one sec.

I'm thinking of having a beer.

Just one. Is that cool?

Yeah, if you want.

Just one. You know?

It's not like...
If you want to, you should.

Alright.

It's all good.

I know.

Jesus.

Hey.

This better be...

You motherfucker!

Fuck you! Son of a bitch!

Hey. Hey!

Hey. You wanna die?

Wanna die? Huh?!

You wanna die? Huh?

You wanna die?

Jesus!

I shouldn't have yelled at them.

What?

Nothing.

Mom, I...
I said nothing.

I didn't think you'd come.
What you got under that blanket?

Nothing. I got nothing.

Nothing. Nothing.

Hey. Hey!

You wanna do this?

Come on, man. Come on.

You really want to do this?

The hard part ain't the doin' it.

The hard part is livin' with it.

I'm already living with it.

You do this, it's gonna change you.
You won't know who you are.

I'll know that I'm alive.

Might not mean much to you, but
it'll be more than you have.

I got a brother in Colorado.

I want you... I'm gonna give you...

I'll give you his phone number.

You call him, and tell him
that I am sorry, about the...
