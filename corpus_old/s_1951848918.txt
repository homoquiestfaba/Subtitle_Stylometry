Fingers, he listens to you.
Talk to him, please.

I have seen what's going to happen with you.
Nothing can change that.

It is done.
-- Well, I want you pick up someone...

At the airport.
-- I know it.

My father, the home affairs
Good for each other, but I want the world to see.

My uncle Fingers, wild
The family. The wealth sharing, you know.

You know how he is to that nickname Fingers
? People do something for him...

He just put on his fingers
To be cut, that's all.

Great nickname.
Just with his fingers cut.

My uncle is cool, but I am here
Only one thing.

Kutjes.

You know what I say?
I want to fuck tonight.

I heard that my favorite uncle
Here.

How are you?
-- How is it Tony? Good to see you.

That is the nephew of the boss.

That is damned big.

What kind of person is he?
-- Can express themselves well.

Did my men ensured good for you?
-- Yes, we are going to the city.

A young man must refresh its oil.

Listen to me...

Your father wants you your virginity that I
Let lose, you show how it works.

There is enough time to use your dick
To wave, but we must make time for...

Affairs.
-- Exactly.

No running joke, okay.

Would you take Tony tonight on your rounds?
The city show, show what we do?

Beginning with his training.
Him company.

Sure.
-- Good then.

Stay out of trouble.
Think of the last time.

Adrea No more, I swear it.
-- It is now funny.

Do you get away. Go out,
l have things to discuss.

I can see you later.

He is a damn problem.

Make sure he is not in trouble.
Perhaps he still learns something.

But now it's time for business.

You can listen to.

What do you think?
-- It is good.

Sorry? It is damned amazing.
What are you talking about?

I do not know a lot of music.

A customer of mine, which are debt
Paid to me...

A portion of the deal
Was its management's contract.

This is her first CD. The sale,
lncreases through the roof. Many promising.

I am sorry, I can still
Not follow.

How long do we do this already?

Too long. I am tired of order behind
The money to hunt.

I am tired of lessons to nietsnutten
Learning, which do not want to pay.

I have always hoped for more.
For us both.

This girl is our way up.

I am sure that it is evil, if they
Discovered that I am her new manager, but...

Count because I do it.
Let you but her.

What is it? What do you see?

Nothing.

You see something.
-- I see nothing.

What do you mean?
Did they have no future?

It does have a future,
But I can not see.

You do not talk much, huh?

Too busy to think of the future
l would bet.

My uncle has told me that you
The future can see, and so forth.

He says, the money, the casinos
The stock market. You know everything.

Do you know where that reminds me?
Have you ever seen that movie, Krull?

Since that plays Cyclop in...

And it is so, because he is an eye
Had exchange for the future.

But a long story short...

Came the evil warlord
Deceived that bastard...

And the only future that he could see
Was his own death.

Man, that was zanie.

What's the plan tonight?

Are we getting something to drink first,
Or is it immediately...

To the pussies.
-- Tonight we work.

He's not.
Come back next week but.

He is in the hospital.
There is a mole removed by him.

Come back next week.

Do you like that, baby?

I have told you, next week.

No, you will now pay old tart.

Otherwise we go into the bunch
Still a little verkloten.

Dude.

Why you helped me, I
There was sewn by Moby Dick.

What do you think, we go back?
Shall we die together trut rams?

Where did they damn well?

I am not.

Are you at the bleeding?
-- I do not know.

Sta.

Let me give you even more time.
I come back next week.

I want to see the money you have.
Or make sure the Fingers.

Because if he does not get,
He takes one of these.

You do not want to.

I see you next week,
l am sorry of the message.

Let's go.

I have never seen such thing.
Verdomde cold ruthless junk.

You knew that there was trut.
How's that? What do you see?

Enjoy you?
People so to beat each other?

Sometimes hear that work.
-- Yes, but you enjoy it?

I think you do.
I think you do in life.

Yes, it is done. Otherwise you do foreplay
The lottery, and that makes you here.

I can not.

How come, that you can not? You are
As a man who does what he is like.

I can not do that because it is not
Shown to me.

At the time that I see,
l go by.

So you can...

You can launch any girl fuck, and you know
Sure you are not sewn.

Safe sex is something great,
l have heard that at least.

That is my dream there.
Let me exactly where something like this.

Music, chicks that fuck each other, while
Another brill to my balls sucks.

Why are we not first
Go afterwards?

It has a lot with him,
As an old man.

Hello, boys.

It is fine for you to see.
As always.

This is Tony, nephew of Fingers.
-- Hello, how are you?

I love you uncle, he is a lovely man.
Have you had anything to drink?

I have a bit of a program...

Got a flat?
-- Enough time to stay.

That can always say, but I know
lt is not true.

Whatever you want, ask for
Just about.

Follow us but.
-- Tony is not so easy.

Let us clothes off.

Where is the room?

That old man there...
-- He and his men were regular customers.

They do not share their pistols.

Has he a gun?
-- He alone, nobody else.

You pay for the protection
Of Fingers.

That is worth every cent.

You know that you are always welcome
To stay.

I am not a hostess more,
Just as I do that themselves prefer.

Can you do something for me?
-- Everything.

Say that I am against Tony after my rounds
Come back.

Sure.

<i>lf you can see the future,
So you think that you can change. </ I></i>

Come on, rot.

You are in the wrong room.

Touch me not to damn.

Come on, that you should not do.
-- Tell me what I should do.

We had just as a fun time...

So go away.

Quietly.

Give that damned pistol.
You are wrong, this is not my fault.

Let that damned pistol.

It is not my fault that gun
Just went off.

Then there is nothing for you to worry about it.
-- Do not closer.

I use this damn ga
Backwards.

Do you shoot all of us?

I have done nothing.

What should we do, you have the gun.
-- No, no massacre today.

Do not worry about it but.
Make sure you just better.

You have to go back.

Nobody.

Chaos, rubbish, panic on the streets.
Your work here is done.

Thanks.

Do not worry. The pussies will
Surely in the row for you.

This is old cake, he.

Every ten minutes there will be another boy
Like me, you the same questions.

That belongs to my work.

I promise you that I will try
To make it interesting.

For me it is a question to ask,
That nobody else.

Nobody? -- Nobody.
-- You must trust me. It seems to be good.

You are loved.
-- Forty seconds. -- Included.

Frank is here.
-- Where?

What does he.
-- It must be your agenda.

Trista, thank you here today
Wanted to come with me.

I do everything for you.

Your first album, which gives you weather
As a great new talent.

Is there pressure? Try you to the excessive
Media attention to compensation.

It is not excessive media attention,
l am not just a pretty face.

I have something to say, and I am so
Excited that my fans want to hear.

Okay, but what difference you and with all those
Other songs beyond?

I think it is my musical influence.
If you go back...

What I mean is, you are young,
You are beautiful. I see you dancing...

Why should we care that something can?

I mean, what's yours
That is so special?

What makes me special?
-- Yes.

Nothing.
-- Nothing?

Bedoel you, what makes me better
Than all the others?

No, not better, but...

Why you earn that?

Why do I do that?

What do you say here?
-- What does he?

She is doing well.
-- I call it K.P.A.B.

Almost nobody has that.
That is the gift of God.

That, and I sing and dance well enough,
Millions of fans with them.

It is something of hundred thousand more.

What else.
That makes not much difference.

I have fans who call my name
l also Ga.

Come on, Trista. They do not call
Even your real name.

Right?
-- What?

I mean, can you at least we
Not even your real name?

That I will never tell.
-- What do you think of my name?

We have each other now met three times.
Three different interviews, you say...

Everything you do for me.

What is I?

We are ready.

Quietly, what is the problem?
What do I do? -- You.

That bastard will be on Thursday,
By the time I am finished with him.

Bring me home.
-- We have that, we have a meeting.

Take me in your leg?

Do not worry, it's studio at ten.
It will be soon.

Well, let dad on his wonderful Fingers
Blue eyes.

That man has nothing against you, child.

Fingers, what do you think.
Lives a dream, or not?

You have destroyed my broadcast, Frank.

It is a pleasure working with you
To meet.

Fingers, that's cute. Should I now
lf you ask why they call it?

I think that if I use talk
l already have my hands a lot.

You are Trista, right?
-- Yes.

Now we are friends,
We are down to business.

Of course, Trista things go great...

Be rotated singles, albums
Start to sell...

The video is often broadcast, but there is
A big difference between a video on MTV...

And between an artist whose headlines
Say that they are nice.

As Frank says, is that someone you need,
You to the next level.

Someone who opens doors.
Someone who is strong.

You resigns.
-- No, I do not resign.

I would step aside. A person
lts influence can be a superstar yours.

He asks for things, and people give
To him. Please.

I love to work with you.
I am totally committed to me your success.

And the only thing I ask is,
You can bet for me.

That is our appointment, that is our promise
We make each other.

When someone our way...

Then I rule that.
-- I believe this damn not.

Line a car for me. -- Trista, baby.
Fuck you, Frank.

That was not so good.
-- That went very well.

Tomorrow we enjoy shopping.

You are still under contract.
-- Rot with contracts.

I think I go.
Can you continue with her?

I am back tomorrow.

I am tired.
-- Yes.

Do you love me, Danny?
-- Of course I do that.

I also love you.

Remove the light at?

I do not like the dark.

The girl is not nervous, do you?

Do not worry. After school
l am here to wait on you, okay?

Your friends will not help
You know that?

No one will help you.
Nobody, but I do.

Your manager has all your accounts
Leeggehaald for me to pay back.

And that little piece of paper, which is
That you are the property are...

Is the only thing that prevents
That he remains alive.

And what does that mean? That means
You have nothing.

And you are nothing, until I say.
And you are on tour...

And you still travel,
Until I see profits.

And if I should ever come back,
We have a totally different conversation.

Understand you me?

Proost.

Do you not think you have had enough?

No, I think it is hardly enough.

It may not be as bad as you think.

You must be tired from it, to name
To have no idea of what you talk.

Where was you actually, when Frank
Me at the sewing?

Did you?
Hielp you him?

No, of course not.
I am your girlfriend.

Remind you your...

How much it pays again
For my girlfriend to be?

Alison, wait.

Who will pay for the drinks?
-- I referred to it not the case, come on.

Alison, wait damn. Come on.

Are you Trista? -- What?
Are you Trista? -- No.

Yes, you do.
-- No.

Can I get a signature.
-- Sure.

For Jake 'the hotty. "
-- Sure.

Trista, my sister loves you.
-- I love your sister.

You were great last.
-- Thank you.

That hurts, damn.
-- Another photo.

Take a picture.

So I can leave?
-- Sure.

What are you going to do?
Where will you go?

There will be something to overcome.

You are now Fingers his possession.

He will do you edit you are exhausted.

Jou throw away, which is what he does.

What imagine that I must do.

Fingers If you know that the legs,
He will come after you hunt.

The only place where he will not come
Search, is here.

I can see some money together to get...

And then you can go far enough away with it,
Fingers can even order not to deal with them.

Why you help me?

I do not know.

That let me just disappear.

As long as I can remember...

I myself have never let something...

Want.

Stay away from windows, and...

Suit but all you need
From the kitchen.

Tap nothing else.

Is all well with you?
-- Yes.

I am doing fine, it's just work.

What have you done today?

I have searched for you.

I like what you here
Already.

For us, as we here for a while.

Who's that, in this picture
Together with you?

Sparky.

Were you well with each other?
-- Yes.

That we went, it is...

He died.

What happened?

I saw it coming, and...

I could do nothing to halt.

I know how that feels.

It feels as if you never
Will be something like...

Feel.

Therefore, I have more scars.

You know that the road map scars
To the soul.

It's been a few weeks ago, I thought
Perhaps we could make a ride?

Tomorrow?

You go away?
-- Yes.

What do you have in your hand?
-- Nothing.

Something that I think that I have seen.

It's not what you think.
-- What should you do?

Do not worry about it.
It is for a friend.

<i>With whom I speak? </ I></i>

Piece shit.

Three weeks, we are already looking
To that slut. Three weeks.

Rondvragen, heads together,
You at my side...

And all that time she was here with you.

You would think that for you to death
Abandoned impaired idiot...

That you had shown some mercy to those
Poor bastard, and had told me the truth...

But no, you stood there and looked.

You are a cold my friend,
A damned cold.

What is this? Do you have something to put aside
Your little lady to take along on vacation?

Is that yours?
I thought it not?

Leave me alone.

What's going on with you?

In the past you had seen it coming.

You lose the feeling.

Say you anything against me?
Are you trying to say something to me?

You put me in this situation.

Do you think I am a bad guy.

I will talk to you.
I am not a bad guy.

I want what everyone wants.

I try everything.
What happens? What do you benefit?

That was not enough for you.
That was not enough, you wanted more.

You have all the love of the world,
But that's not enough for you.

So you took my friend, and put him
Against me. And then?

You self piece of shit.

I think...

That you do not know what's for you
To be about.

Tell me...

What should I tell you?

Your real name.

The case is closed, you must skirt.
-- You must let me inside.

You do not understand.
I am a doctor.

You have to the front.
-- There is somebody dead. I must Trista.

I must Trista.

Come on man, I am a doctor.

If she dies, it is your fault.

That is not true.

Of people trying to do better.

Hers. I make people's lives better.

Consider this view. A girl is born
With a nose on the ground that you can finish.

There is no date for the eindfeest
For this girl. None shy first kiss.

She comes into action, and of course
You lapt her fine.

Eventually this girl wrote a farewell -
Letter to her cat, and jumps from one roof.

The same girl comes to me...

I use a little magic, and my friend
That letter will never be written.

I have saved her life.

I have saved a life today.

Maybe I have also known,
You know it but never.

But anyway, I sleep tonight
ln a damn big house.

I must urination.

My husband.
-- Your husband.

How is it with the snakes?
-- They are great.

The times demolish me very much.
-- Feel you yourself?

Exhausted. I fight against a cold.

I would not bother you.
-- That is impossible.

Has a transfusion.
