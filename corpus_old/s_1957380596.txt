Woman: DANIEL?

WHEN DID WE GET LOST?

WHEN DID WE MOVE
SO FAR FROM THE LIGHT?

WHEN DID I START THINKING
THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG...

WORRYING THAT MAYBE
I MADE A MISTAKE,

THAT I MARRIED
THE WRONG PERSON?

YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DRIVE.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS--

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS GET OUT OF BED

AND GO TO THE CAR.

I'M SORRY.

I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

I'M NERVOUS.WHY?

ABOUT SEEING
YOUR DAD.

THAT'S OKAY.

SOMETIMES I'M SCARED.

NOBODY MAKES
THAT MUCH MONEY

WITHOUT CARING ABOUT IT.

IT'S OKAY--
WE PAY HIM BACK OR NOT.

MY FATHER
HAS PLENTY OF MONEY.

IT IS A LOT OF MONEY.
AND WHAT AM I GONNA
TELL HIM?

YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO LOSE IT, DID YOU?

OF COURSE NOT.SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

YOU JUST SIT DOWN
TOGETHER AND TALK.

HEY...

WHAT IF THIS WAS OUR
LAST DAY TOGETHER?

WOULD YOU BE
SATISFIED?

IT'S NOT.BUT WHAT IF IT WAS?

I'M NERVOUS ABOUT
SEEING YOUR FATHER
AT THE WEDDING.

THAT'S ALL.

I CAN'T HELP IT.

Irene:
MY LORD AND MY GOD...

WHICH KEEPS ME
AWAY FROM YOU.

MY LORD AND MY GOD,

WHICH LEADS ME TO YOU.

IF YOU'D TURNED BACK
WHERE I HAD TOLD YOU,

WE WOULD'VE BEEN FINE.

I'M SURE THIS ROAD
CONNECTS BACK TO
THE MAIN ONE.

EVENTUALLY.

MY LORD AND MY GOD,

TAKE MYSELF FROM ME

AND GIVE ME
COMPLETELY TO YOU.

NOW HE THINKS
HE'S GOT A LIFT.

I DON'T LIKE IT.

THERE'S NOTHING WE
CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW.

BUT THEY'RE COMING.

COME ON, MAN.
THEY'RE COMING.

â™ªâ™ª

YOU NEED SOME HELP?

THERE'S A KNIFE MISSING.

THERE WERE THREE OF US
AT DINNER.

THERE'S ONLY
TWO KNIVES IN THE SINK.

YOU DON'T HAVE IT,
DO YOU?

NO?

WELL, LET'S SEE.

HMM.

STOP IT.

FACE THE WALL.

LOOK AT THE WALL.

MM-HMM.

WELL, YOU KNOW,

IT'S NOT THE MOST
ORIGINAL PLACE
TO HIDE A KNIFE.

OH, WHAT THE HELL.
TAKE IT.

GO AHEAD.

I WANT TO SEE
IF A LADY LIKE YOU

WILL SAVE HER BABY.

GO AHEAD, TAKE IT.

DO IT.

DON'T--

COME ON.

YOU'LL BE DOING ME
A FAVOR.

HMM? THINK ABOUT
YOUR BABY.

â™ªâ™ª

Woman: HOW ARE YOU AND DANIEL DOING?

BETTER THAN LAST WEEK?

Irene: I'M NOT SURE.

ABOUT THE SAME.

I'M STARTING TO PRAY.

TO PRAY

I DON'T REMEMBER
IF WE EVER TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

YOU'RE RELIGIOUS?

NO.

I MEAN
WHEN I WAS A KID,

LIKE EVERYONE
IN SWITZERLAND.

SO, WHAT DO YOU
PRAY FOR?

FOR SOMETHING
TO HAPPEN.

I MEAN, NOT JUST
FOR ME AND DANIEL,
BUT...

FOR EVERYONE.

â™ªâ™ª

TAKE IT UP TO HER.

HERE YOU GO.

WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

IT'S A SAINT.

YOU'RE
A CATHOLIC GIRL?

NOT REALLY.

BUT I TRY.

ME, TOO.

WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT THAT SAINT?

HE'S IN THE LIGHT.

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

HE'S OUTSIDE
OF THIS MESS.

CLOSE TO GOD.

EAT UP.

â™ªâ™ª

MMM.

MMM.

I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE
SAYING ABOUT THE LIGHT.

I REALLY DUG THAT.

CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THAT?

JUST WHAT I SAID.

WHAT?

IT'S PEACE.

PEACE?

YOU NEVER FELT
THAT WAY?

NO.

I GUESS...

YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
ALWAYS MADE ME
FEEL IN THE DARK.

AT LEAST, THAT'S
WHAT I FELT LIKE.

YOU KNOW,
BUT WITH LEO--

WITH LEO, IT'S
ALL DIFFERENT.

HE SEES
WHAT I'M GOOD AT.

HE GIVES ME
A PURPOSE.

SO, IF YOU KILL ME,

OR THE PEOPLE
DOWNSTAIRS,

THAT'S PART OF
THE PURPOSE, TOO?

HMM, MAYBE.

MAYBE THAT'S JUST
SUPPOSED TO BE.

I MEAN, MAYBE
THEY NEEDED TO GO.

I MEAN, THE LAW
KILLS PEOPLE
ALL THE TIME.

THEY FEEL WHAT
THEY'RE DOING
HAS PURPOSE,

SO IT'S OKAY
IF THEY SHOOT
SOME POOR SAP.

BUT HOW DO YOU
KNOW WHAT'S
GOOD OR BAD?

LEO CAN SEE
WHAT'S GOOD.

AND NOW
ICAN SEE IT.

OR AT LEAST
I CAN FEEL IT.

THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU
TALKED ABOUT THE LIGHT...

I UNDERSTAND IT.

OTHERWISE, I NEVER
WOULD'VE MENTIONED IT.

HEY, CAN I HEAR
THE BABY?
WHAT?

CAN I LISTEN
TO THE BABY?

PUT YOUR KNIFE DOWN.

NO, NO,
I JUST WANT TO--
WHOA, WHOA--

PUT YOUR KNIFE DOWN.

LOOK, IT'S COOL.
I JUST WANT TO LISTEN.

CAN I--
CAN I LISTEN?

CAN YOU PUT
YOUR KNIFE DOWN?

I--PLEASE.

WELL, CAN I LISTEN?

PUT IT DOWN, OKAY?

PLEASE.

OH, I CAN HEAR HIM.

HE'S--

â™ªâ™ª

Daniel: YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS GET OUT OF BED

AND GO TO THE CAR.

YEAH.

[newscaster speaking
on television]

OH.

SHH.

FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!WHAT'S UP?

MY FRIEND HAS
HIS FUCKIN' PHONE OFF.

I'M GIVING HIM
TEN MINUTES.IT'LL BE FINE.

FOR ALL WE KNOW,
THE COPS ARE ON THEIR
WAY HERE RIGHT NOW.

HE'S GONNA BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

WHAT TIME DID YOUR FRIEND
SAY HE WAS COMING BACK?

HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.
HE'S JUST SOME GUY--

WHAT TIME DID HE SAY
HE WAS COMING BACK?

HE SAID FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

I DON'T KNOW.WHAT TIME?

I DON'T KNOW.
HE SAID FIRST THING.

9:00, 10:00.

IT'S ALREADY 11:00.

SHH. DON'T BE SCARED.

HE'LL COME BACK TO US.

FUCK.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT THING

KEEP OUT OF HER STUFF.

SHE GAVE IT TO ME.BULLSHIT.

DUDE,
SHE GAVE IT TO ME.

GIVE IT TO ME.
GIVE IT TO ME.

THANK YOU.YEAH, MAN.

RENNY MUST'VE
SNATCHED THIS

WHILE YOU WEREN'T
WATCHING. I'M SORRY.

IT WAS A GIFT.

WHAT?

YOU GAVE IT TO HIM?

WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

HUH?

I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SMARTER THAN THAT.

WHAT ARE YOU WASTING
YOUR TIME FOR?

WHERE IS MY HUSBAND?

HE'S FINE,
I TOLD YOU.

YOU'RE GONNA
SEE HIM SOON.

TELL ME SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS SAINT.

WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO KNOW?

I DON'T KNOW.
ANYTHING, YOU KNOW?

WHERE'S HE FROM?

SWITZERLAND.

VERY CLOSE TO
THE PLACE WHERE
I GREW UP.

IS IT NICE?

MM-HMM.

HE WAS MARRIED.

12 CHILDREN.

HEH.

GOOD JOB.

BUT INSIDE, HE WAS
VERY UNHAPPY.

HE LEFT HIS FAMILY TO
LIVE IN SOLITUDE...

AND TO BE CLOSER
TO GOD.

THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
A DEADBEAT.

I THINK HIS WIFE
UNDERSTOOD.

YEAH?

WHAT ELSE?

HE DIDN'T EAT
FOR 20 YEARS.

THAT'S FUNNY--
20 YEARS.

I DON'T FALL
FOR THAT STUFF.

SHH.

IT'S OKAY.

I DON'T WANT TO.

THIS ISN'T ABOUT
WHAT YOU WANT.

ALL RIGHT.

I TOLD YOU.GREAT.

SHE GAVE IT TO ME--DROP IT.

SHE GAVE IT TO ME
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND.

OH, YOU UNDERSTAND?YEAH.

WHAT THE FUCK?

WHAT THE FUCK'S
YOUR PROBLEM?!

YOU'RE GONNA CRY
OVER A LITTLE

THAT'S NOT ANNABELLE
UP THERE.

THAT'S A STACK
OF MONEY!

THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

UHH!

COME ON.

RENNY?

GET IN THE HOUSE,
YOU FUCKING BITCH.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING, RENNY?

GET BACK IN THIS CHAIR
RIGHT NOW!

DON'T MAKE ME
COME OVER THERE!

GET IN THE CHAIR, PLEASE.
GET IN THE CHAIR.

I'M NOT GONNA
TOUCH YOUR BABY.
GET IN THE CHAIR.

GET IN THE CHAIR.
HE'S NOT A BAD GUY,
YOU KNOW.

EVERYTHING WAS GOING
REALLY GOOD.

YOU MAKE HIM THINK
TOO MUCH, YOU KNOW THAT?

HE AND HER BROAD--
THEY HAD EVERYTHING.

THEY HAD A HOUSE AND
ALL THAT FUCKIN' SHIT.

I DON'T KNOW.
WE CAME IN HERE.

I NEVER MET HER.

I DON'T WANT
TO MEET HER.

HE'S ALWAYS SAYING
THAT HE WANTS MONEY.

OKAY, WE'VE JUST
GOTTA STAY ON TRACK.

STAY ON TRACK.AAH!

I DON'T MIND
EITHER WAY.

YOUR DAD BETTER
COME THROUGH
WITH SOME MONEY,

'CAUSE YOU'RE
STARTING TO RUN
OUT OF TIME.

WAIT!WHAT?!

WHAT?

PLEASE PROMISE
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
HURT MY BABY, RENNY.

YOU'RE A SPECIAL LADY
WITH YOUR LIGHT.

WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

RENNY!

HOW IS SHE?

SHE'S GOOD.

SHE'S GREAT.
I TIED HER UP.

UNTIE HER.

UNTIE HER.

DON'T START WITH ME.

DADDY'S NOT
COMING THROUGH.

YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

IT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, MAN.

MURPH WOULD'VE
BEEN HERE BY NOW.

HE SHOWS UP NOW,
IT'S IN THE BACK SEAT
OF A COP CAR.

EITHER WAY, WE'RE
FUCKED OR DEAD.

OR YOUR FRIEND
RIPPED US OFF.

IN WHICH CASE,
WE STILL NEED HER.

UH...I SAY
CUT OUR TIES, LEO.

YOU KNOW, JUST--

I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

I'LL GET US
BACK ON TRACK.

I CAN DO IT.

GIVE HIM ANOTHER HOUR,
ALL RIGHT?

IF THE OLD MAN
DOESN'T COME THROUGH,

SHE'S DEAD.

Irene: HEY, HOW CAN YOU WRITE ME SOMETHING SO SWEET

IN ONE MOMENT,

AND THE NEXT YOU'RE LIKE THIS?

HUH?

I'M SORRY.

I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

I'M NERVOUS.WHY?

ABOUT SEEING
YOUR DAD.

THAT'S OKAY.

UNTIE ME.

I'M SCARED.

PLEASE.

WE COULD--SHH.

SHH.

YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

I MIGHT.

I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE DIFFERENT.

UHH!

OHH!

I'M SORRY.

I'M SORRY.

IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

A LOT OF NOSEBLEEDS
WHEN YOU PRAY.

YEAH.

WHAT DOES IT MATTER
ANYHOW, HUH?

HEY.

DRIVING UP TO
THE HOUSE.

SHH.

Man: GEORGE

WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

I DON'T KNOW.

RENNY!

HEY.

â™ªâ™ª

YOU KNOW?

I MEAN, WE ONLY GOT
ONE SHOT AT THIS.

ARE YOU
FUCKIN' INSANE?

NO, WE GOTTA
GET GOING NOW.

I NEVER KILLED NOBODY.

I NEVER KILLED NO ONE.

WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKIN' AT ME
LIKE THAT FOR, MAN?

I'M TRYIN' TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING PERSONAL.

NO, I GET IT.

PLEASE...

DON'T LOOK AT ME.

UHH!

IT'S NATURE, RENNY.

THINGS DIE...

AND THINGS ARE BORN.

UHH!

WHAT?

WHAT?

HE KNOWS.

CAN I HOLD HIM?

I WANT TO
HOLD HIM, RENNY.

PLEASE.

WAIT.

CAN YOU FEEL HIM?

HE'S KICKING.

HE'S STRONG.

IF YOU LISTEN CAREFUL,

YOU CAN HEAR HIM CRY.

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY.
