Could you do a reading now?

Yeah.

Please have a seat.

Death.

It refers to loss.

You've experienced
loss, a great loss.

The 10 of cups.

This card, with the death card,
refers to love.

You've lost someone you loved.

Someone from your future
is now in your past.

The hanged man.

It's not a bad card.

But it refers to blockage.

You need to grieve
to be able to move forward.

The hermit.

Time. Time is very important.

There's corruption. Something
is being concealed from you.

It's very important
that you act cautiously.

Your intuition, your instinct,
will come into play here.

It's OK. That's enough.

But... we
haven't finished.

It's all right.

Thank you for your time.

Sorry I'm late.

That's OK!

OK!

I ordered us
crab salad.

Oh, great! Yeah.

So?

What'd she say?

Oh, there's
nothing to tell.

[Chuckling]:
Oh, no, no, no.

That's not what
I paid $100 for.

It's impossible
to tell anything

from a worn-out deck
of playing cards, Mother.

It's Tarot, darling.

Tarot.

[ Chuckling ]
Ladies?

Thank you.

And
bon appÃ©tit.

Thanks.

So what about Italy?
What's happening with the trip?

Yeah! I, um...
I made a reservation.

I'm just...
I haven't decided.

What are you
waiting for? Go!

Go! Explore!

It would be nice
to get away.

It sure would!

And don't let
anything stop you.

Understand?

Yes, Mother.

Good! Mmm, this
is delicious, hmm?

Mmm!

No, there's
nobody else.

Yeah? Yeah,
I just got here myself.

So CSI's all done
taking their pictures, right?

All right.

So let's see what we got here.

Detective Ortuso!

Yeah?

It's freezing tonight!

So how long do you figure?

Not long.
Couple hours, max.

Well, there's no signs
of a struggle. No wounds.

No blood, except
for that nosebleed.

We'll take him in.
Get a closer look.

Mrs. Brooks?

Yeah?

I'm Detective
Ortuso, Chicago PD.

May I come in?

Uh... yeah!

Is there a problem?

Can we go
sit down somewhere?

Yeah, sure.

Please, have a seat.

Thanks.

Samuel Brooks.
Is he your husband?

Was. He passed away
5 years ago.

Uh, really?

We found the body of a man

who died earlier tonight
at the waterfront.

I have reason to believe
this may be your husband.

No. That must be a mistake.

Well, this man had
no identification on him,

except for this medical bracelet

with your phone number on it.

Which is how I found you.

You recognize it?

It was his bracelet, but--

Look.

If it's a mistake,

we'll get it all cleared up.

But in the meantime,

I'm gonna need you to come down
and identify this body.

I'll get my things.

So you're quite certain.

Yeah.

I'm very sorry
for your loss.

Have a seat, Mrs. Brooks.

Look, I know this must be
a terrible shock for you.

I don't--
I don't understand.

I do have to ask you
a few questions.

OK.

So when exactly was the last
time you saw your husband?

Sam died 5 years ago.

Or...

So-- so I thought.

Actually, your husband
came here to Chicago

from Detroit earlier today.

On a one-way ticket.

You wouldn't happen to know why
he was coming here, would you?

I-- I...

I already told you,
Detective, I--

Or what he was doing
down at the waterfront?

I already thought he was dead.

It appears your husband
died of a massive coronary.

So... we won't be
performing an autopsy.

Did your husband have any
medical problems, Mrs. Brooks?

Yeah, Sam had, um...

high blood pressure
and diabetes.

Yeah, well,
that'll do it.

As I understand it...

Your husband went missing

on April 13, 1999. Am I right?

It was thought to be
a boating accident?

Yes.

Yeah.

Forgive me for asking, but...

You did receive his life
insurance benefits, am I right?

Meaning what?

I was simply pointing out,

the insurance company
won't be too happy

to learn they
paid death benefits

for someone who wasn't dead yet!

Are you suggesting we cheated
the insurance company?

Is that what you think?

Detective, I need help

finding out what happened.

Are you gonna
help me, or not?

The coroner ruled

your husband's death
is a natural cause.

So unless something
would indicate otherwise,

there's not a lot more I can do!

Meaning there'll
be no investigation.

Unless something turns up, no!

OK.

Uh, Mrs. Brooks?

Look. I can't get personally
involved, you understand?

But this guy...
he may be able

to help you
find some answers.

Give him a call.

Thank you.

[Waiter]: There you go.

How you doing?

This feels like
a bad dream, you know?

One that I can't
wake up from.

Well...

At least you know
the truth about Sam.

What's that
supposed to mean?

Sometimes you think
you really know someone,

like, you really know them,

but in the end...
you really don't.

Sam loved me!

I'm...
I'm sure he did.

In his own way.

Why do you always
have to qualify everything?

Well, I hate to say it,

but obviously you didn't
know everything about Sam!

I'm sorry, honey.

It's just that
I think you should...

You've got to put all this
behind you once and for all!

Five years,
in the blink of an eye?

I think you
have to try.

Jean, I love you more
than anything in the world.

And I don't want you
to be hurt anymore!

I want you
to move on, you know?

I want you to let it go!

It'll be for the best.

You'll see.

I don't think
I can quite yet.

Where are you going?
You're not staying for lunch?

I can't stay.
I have an appointment.

Jean...

Are you Mr. Fate?

Yeah, you can
call me Eddie.

Coffee, or a drink,
or something?

Oh, no, no,
I'm fine. Thanks.

I was expecting
someone a bit older.

Yeah. We private
detectives

come in all shapes,
sizes, and ages.

You got my card from
Oscar Ortuso, Chicago PD, right?

Yeah.

Wanna grab a seat?

Yeah, sure. Thanks.

So... you told me a bit
about your situation.

How'd you get
the name Fate?

Everyone always
asks me that.

It's my real last name.
It's weird, huh?

Believe me, I've
heard all the jokes.

I bet.

Yeah. Tell me about
your... your husband.

Sam was a doctor.

Uh... we lived
here in Chicago.

We were very happy.

What changed?

He walked out the door,
and I never saw him again.

Our boat was found
out on the lake.

The propellers were
tangled in some weeds.

The police think that...
maybe he got into the water

to fix it,
and drowned.

And now he turns up
5 years later.

I found the rental car,
like the plane ticket,

was paid for in cash.

I don't think your husband
wanted anyone to know

he was coming to Chicago.

What we have to find out
is why he was here.

Look, I'm sorry
I have to ask this, but...

Was there anybody that your
husband might have been seeing?

No.

I see.

Did he have
any other family?

Uh, yeah. He had
a half-sister, Denise,

who lived in Detroit.

I never met her, but, um...

They didn't get along,
from what I understand.

I don't know
where she is now.

I need to find out

why the man
I loved left me.

What he's been
doing since...

Did he ever
really love me,

or was our entire
marriage a lie?

I need some
answers, Mr. Fate.

Yeah. I have
a bit already.

One thing:
There's no record

of a Sam Brooks living
in or near Detroit.

It's... it's funny.

In fact, there's no record

of him living
anywhere in the state.

It's almost like
he didn't exist.

I'm sorry.

How 'bout
I fly to Detroit,

take a look around,
see what I can find out.

Thank you.

Uh, do you need
your fee up front, or...

Oh, no, no.

I just need
some expense money.

I drink a lot of coffee.

[ Both chuckling ]

Yeah, I need
to cancel my flight.

Uh, I don't know when
I'll be able to re-book.

OK. Thank you.

[Man in crowd]:
Yeah!

So I guess you owe
me a referral fee!

You're drinking it!

Hey, what do you make

of this whole
thing, Oscar?

I don't know, Eddie.

I got mixed feelings
about this thing.

Maybe her husband picked
a strange way to ditch her.

But on the other hand,

the Brooks woman probably
collected a million dollars

when her husband went missing!

Now, 5 years later,
he's back here to collect.

I don't think so.
No, I believe her.

Don't underestimate
the money factor.

It can make normal people
do very abnormal things.

Not with this woman.

No, it's not
about the money.

For her, it's about
loss and betrayal.

That's why I gave
her your card.

Now, you just
go out there,

and you bring me back
some answers, all right?

Yeah.

Is there anything
I can do to help

with the funeral
arrangements?

No, it's fine, Mom.
I have everything handled.

You know...

Burying Sam might
actually be therapeutic.

You know, a kind of
closure, if you will?

It's hard to just close
the door on what happened.

But... wouldn't it
be better to just

remember the good times?

And let...
let all the rest go?

I've hired
a private detective.

Why?

You may find out some things
you'd rather not know!

I have to find out
what happened.

I have no other choice.

Mrs. Brooks!

Hi. Um... can I get
you some coffee?

Oh no, I'm fine.

You sure?
It's no problem.

No, I'm here
to sign the paperwork

to release my husband's
body for the funeral.

Right.

Have a seat, please.

I'm afraid
that's not possible.

Why is that?

Your husband's remains
were, uh...

picked up about an hour ago
by someone else.

I tried to phone you.

By whom?

Charlotte Porter,
from Detroit.

I-- I don't know who that is!

She was his new wife.

Now, from what I understood,
she produced

all the right paperwork,

so there was really nothing
anyone could do.

It's too late.

I'm really sorry about this.

Wait... wait a minute.

From what you understood?

Yeah. Uh...

I wasn't here.

I found out about it myself

this morning when I got in.

-
CCA Flight 20 to Detroit,

final boarding
at gate number 8.

Jean!

Hey! I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

I've decided
to come with you.

OK. No problem.
They're boarding right now.

What's up, yo?

Yo, man, what's up?

Are you serious?
Is this where we're staying?

Since you hadn't
planned on being with me,

I just thought
I'd stay here.

No need to waste your money
on an expensive hotel.

Could we find a place
a little more inviting?

Pretty inviting.

You should put my name
on both rooms.

Safer.

OK.

There you go.
Rooms 1421 and 1423

are next to each other.
The elevators are to your right.

Thanks.
Thank you.

All right,
I guess we're set!

We should see
the wife tonight.

Tonight?

We should
call her first.

Well, personally, I like
the element of surprise.

I'm exhausted. Can we do it
first thing in the morning?

Yeah. Yeah.

How 'bout a nightcap?

Uh, can I have
a mineral water, please?

Coffee.

So, Charlotte Porter.

Does the name mean
anything to you?

No, never heard it
before in my life.

God, I can't believe
this is happening.

I'm sure it's difficult
to take at times.

This isn't the truth!

It can't be.

Seems like it.

They were married.

I can't accept that
Sam was unfaithful to me.

It's human nature to believe
what you want to believe.

You're quite the
philosopher, Mr. Fate.

You could say I'm a student
of human behaviour.

So what made you become
a private investigator?

Uh, by default.

I was...

...shall I say, excused
from police service a while ago.

You mean fired.

It's called
a euphemism, I believe?

[Chuckling]: Caught.

Well...

Here's to finding the truth.

To finding the truth.

You know what?

I'll be right back.

I'm just gonna
check something out.

OK.

Hey!

Hey.

How'd you sleep?

Oh, not so bad.
Should we get a taxi?

I got a rental car.

Here we go.

OK. Stop trying
to save me money, Eddie.

Well, it is your money!

You ready for this?

[Sighing]: Yeah.

Hi. We're here to see
Charlotte Porter.

Oh. Please come in.

Miss Porter will
be down in a moment.

Please make
yourselves comfortable.

Thank you.

Hello.

Oh, Simon, um...

Please get my guests
whatever they'd like.

I'm fine, thanks.

Tea, please?

You, um... you have
a lovely home.

Thank you.

Sam and I were
very comfortable here.

this is very awkward

for all of us, but...

What can I do for you?

Did, uh...
Sam choose the house?

We both did. Why?

Just, um...
it's not him.

Well, I can't imagine
why you would say that!

Sorry, I don't
mean to be rude.

This just... wasn't his taste.

Well, perhaps
with you it wasn't.

So, um...

How did you
and Sam meet?

What difference
does it make now?

We...

We met at a medical conference.

Are you a doctor as well?

Oh God, no!

One doctor in the house
is enough, and that was Sam.

So he opened a practice
here in Detroit?

No, no.
He preferred research.

He stopped
taking patients.

That's hard to believe.

Sam was so...

interested in his patients,
especially children.

It was very
important to him.

Well, as I said,
he had no patients here.

Man, this house
must be expensive!

It is.

So you were obviously
financially well-off

when you met Sam.

Is that correct?

It's correct to say that's
none of your business, Mr. Fate.

[Simon]: Excuse me.

May I ask about
the funeral arrangements?

I... I never thought...

Sam was cremated last night.

It was a very private ceremony.

I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry.
May I use your restroom?

Yes, um... Simon will
show you where it is.

Do you know why
your husband went to Chicago?

Well, he did
travel quite a bit.

So you know why he was there?

No, Mr. Fate, I don't!

Do you know he only
had a one-way ticket?

Do you know why
that might be, at all?

I... I don't know. Maybe...

Maybe he made a mistake when
he booked it. I don't know.

But it doesn't mean

what you might like it to mean.

Oh! No...

Sam and I were
very much in love!

It doesn't mean anything!

No.

Thank you very much
for your help.

You're welcome.

Again, I'm really sorry.

Sam was a remarkable man.

I know that we'll both miss him.

Oh, I hope I was
of some help to you.

Actually, um...
Sam had a half-sister, Denise.

who lived here in Detroit.
Did you ever meet her?

No, Sam never
mentioned her.

As far as I know,
Sam was an only child.

Well, thank you.

You're welcome.

Bye.

Bye.

Sam would have never wanted
to live in a house like that.

What did you
find upstairs?

I found his bedroom.

If they were
so much in love,

why did they have
separate bedrooms?

How'd you know
it was his bedroom?

His belongings were
all over the place.

I even found an
unfinished crossword puzzle

with his handwriting.

I know it was his room.

So she was lying.

Mind if I join you?

No, no, not at all.

Listen, I, um...

I wanted to thank you.

I don't think that
I could have done this alone.

Oh, no, no.
It's not necessary.

It's all part
of the service.

Uh, can I have
a scotch, please?

-
You got it.

Um, I got
some information.

OK.

Charlotte Porter's house

is held by
a Michigan corporation.

BFA Medical Supplies, Inc.

Thank you.
Uh, what's that mean?

Maybe nothing, but...

Whoever owns the corporation

bought the house.

[Both]: With cash.

Of course.
Exactly.

So, we check out
BFA Medical Supplies tomorrow.

Yeah. Yeah, you bet.

It's hard, you know.

I've already grieved the loss
of Sam. I have to do it again.

Have you been with
anybody else since Sam?

No.

It's strange, sharing
such intimate details

with somebody
I hardly know.

But I'm glad it's
with you... Eddie.

Yeah. So am I.

Is that you, Jean?

Chris!

It's been so long!

It is you!
How have you been?

Oh, you know...

Aww.

Well, all right!

Look at you!
You look fantastic!

Oh, please.

You're always
one to flatter.

Well, when it's true!

Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm being rude.

Eddie, this is
Chris Schwartzman.

Eddie Fate.
Hey.

So how have you been?

Uh... good!

But more importantly,
how are you, Jean?

I'm fine.

Just fine?

Well, you know.

Yeah. That was a tough one.

Losing Sam.

Yeah, I still
miss him, you know.

Yeah.

Uh, Chris and Sam

went to medical
school together.

Is that right?

Yeah.

Well, he was the smarter
one, though. He got you!

[Chuckling]:
Oh! Please.

You know what, guys?

I'm gonna go to my room.

Get some shut-eye.

Nice to meet you, doctor.

You too!

I'll catch up with you.

Yeah, definitely.

Friend?

No, no, just
a business associate.

So what brings
you to Detroit?

Oh... one of those
boring medical conferences.

Oh.

What about you, Jean?
Why are you in Detroit?

Uh, I'm, uh...

looking into buying
some property in the area.

"No credit history on record
and no accounts opened

"for Dr. Samuel Brooks
since May 1999."

It was great
seeing you again, Chris.

Oh... I've
missed you, Jean!

Listen,
have lunch with me!

Now that we've reconnected,
I'd like to see you again!

Uh, how about
we make it tomorrow?

1:00 in the lobby.

Sounds great.

Good.

OK! See you tomorrow.

All right.

Excuse me.

Eddie!

Oscar. You at
Blues Connection?

And it's your round!

Listen, listen.
You got a minute?

Hell, I got all night. Shoot!

Look. This woman's
husband, Sam Brooks?

It's like he disappeared
into thin air after 1999.

Yeah, so?

So? No credit history,
no driver's license!

Not even a library card.

Well, he must have
wanted it that way!

Yeah, but why?

There is no why
sometimes, Eddie.

People, they just
do crazy things!

No, I don't buy it.

This guy has everything,
and he fakes his own death!

-Whoo!

So what are you saying?

I'm saying, maybe
he had some help!

Remember how you always say,
follow the money?

I never thought you were
actually listening to me!

I'm flattered!

Well, listen to this.

This Charlotte Porter.

She lives in a $3 1/2 million
home up in the Detroit hills.

Well... that
explains it, my friend.

The good doctor's
moving on up.

-
No, no, no.

Eddie. How many times
have I told you?

Money changes people!

No, this guy didn't change.
He did a total about-face!

You keep digging, eventually
you'll provoke someone,

and things'll start
to happen, all right?

All right, thanks.

-
All right, Eddie.

Oh, hey. What's up?

I've been reading Sam's diary.
I wanted to show you something.

Yeah, come in!

I've read through it
a bunch of times,

I've just never put it
together until tonight.

Sam made a number of trips
from Chicago to Detroit

in the last 2 months
before he disappeared.

Each time he came
back to Chicago,

he met with
someone named Castor.

But if you look here,
the day before he went missing,

even though he made
the trip to Detroit,

it's the first time
Castor isn't mentioned.

I don't know
what it means,

but maybe
it's important?

Does the name
Castor ring a bell?

No.

Can I keep this overnight?

Yeah, sure.

OK.

I'll, uh, see you
in the morning?

Yeah, yeah.

Good night.

Good night.

So like you said,

the name Castor
keeps showing up

in your husband's diary.

You think it could be
one of his patients?

I don't know.

What happens to patients
when a doctor dies?

The State Medical
Association decides.

They assign the patients
to different physicians.

Actually, I know
Chris Schwartzman got a few.

He and Sam had
the same specialty.

What was that?

Oncology.

Sam specialized
in leukemia cases,

mainly paediatric.

I don't know.

There's a missing link.
Some sort of connection.

You know, you're
very intuitive.

Why were you fired
off the police force?

The higher-ups
didn't like my style.

I was a little too
out of the box.

Ah. Too much of a maverick?

I guess, something
like that, yeah.

Look, I'm gonna fly back
to Chicago this morning.

I should be back tonight.

So just... do me a favour,
and stay close to the hotel.

OK!

You know, in fact, just...

Stay in the hotel, all right?

You're treating me like
I'm some kind of prisoner.

No, I'm treating you
like you're a valued client.

Directory assistance.
For what city?

Detroit, Michigan.

For what name?

Could I have a listing
for Denise Brooks?

-
Do you have an address?

Uh... no, I'm sorry,
I don't have an address.

I'm sorry, I have
no listing for that name.

Uh... would you be able
to go back as far as 1999?

No, I'm sorry, ma'am, our
records don't go back that far.

No. All right. Thank you.

Yes, sir. We handle

the referrals
of deceased physicians.

May I have the name
of the doctor, please?

Yes. It's Dr. Samuel Brooks.
He passed away April 1999.

It would look
like Dr. Brooks' patients

were referred
to several doctors.

Is there a particular patient
you're interested in?

Yes, Castor? I don't
have a first initial.

I have a Ricky Castor.

His file was referred
to... Dr. C. Schwartzman.

East 31st Street, Chicago.

Thank you very much.

-
Happy to be of help.

All right.

All right, let's try
phone listings for 1999.

Denise Brooks, 44 Mill Street.

Hi.

Hello.

Uh, is Dr. Schwartzman in?

No, sir. I'm afraid
he's out of town.

Did you have an appointment?

No, I didn't, but
it's quite urgent I see him.

Is there anybody
else I can see?

Is it a medical matter?

This is a doctor's
office, isn't it?

Could I have
your name, please?

It's, uh, Smith. Alvin Smith.

I'll check.
Can you wait a minute?

Yeah. I can wait!

Can you wait a minute?

Sure.

This can't be right.

Are you sure
this is 44 Mill Street?

This is definitely 44.

I'm gonna make a quick call.

Hi, yes. I was calling about
your listing at 44 Mill Street?

-
Yes, I'm the agent.
May I help you?

Yeah. Do you know what
happened to the house?

-
May I ask
why you're inquiring?

I might be interested
in making an offer.

Was the house torn down?

-
Uh, no. I believe
there was a fire.

A fire?

Do you know when that was?

-
I'm not really sure.

OK, I'll call back
if I'm interested.

-
Certainly, call anytime.

Thank you.

-
Kama Sutra Club.

Hey, is there
an Emilio Castor there?

-
We don't give out that kind
of information over the phone.

It's important!

-
We don't give that
information over the phone!

Could you just--

Hi, honey.
What can I get you?

Uh... an espresso.

Does this look
like a coffee shop?

OK, I'll take
a scotch then, please.

All right.

Keep the change.

Hey!
Mm-hmm?

Is there a guy named
Emilio Castor who works here?

Yeah, he's
the day janitor.

Is he here now?

Why do you
wanna see him?

Personal business.

You his loan shark?

No. No, actually,
I owe him money.

I'll see if he's busy.

Thank you.

No. No thank you.

He's coming.

Thanks.

You owe me money?

Is there anywhere
we can go talk?

It's important.

Guess I take
my break now.

So, what are
you, a cop?

No. No,
sir, I'm not.

I'm with the
State Medical Association.

You got papers?

Yeah.

Only this kind.

I got a couple
questions to ask

about your son,
if that's OK.

He's gone.
My boy's gone.

What do you mean?

He passed away?

I didn't have the money
to continue his treatment.

Do you remember what
doctors you took him to?

Was one of them
Dr. Samuel Brooks?

Yeah, but he disappeared!

He was a good doctor.
He looked after my boy.

Who paid for the treatment?
Was it Dr. Brooks?

And when he...
when he went away,

Dr. Schwartzman
wouldn't do any treatment

without money. Big money.

Which I didn't have.

Know how that makes me feel?

I don't need your charity.

I wanna show you something.

That's my Ricky.

I'm-- I'm truly
very sorry, Mr. Castor.

Thank you.

Sorry, excuse me.
Chris! I'm so sorry I'm late.

I was starting to think
you forgot about our lunch!

Of course not. Just wait
a few more minutes.

I wanna freshen
up a bit.

Of course!
Be right back!

[Scoffing]: Long lunch!

You're early
for last call!

Could I get
one more, please?

So you being back
here in Chicago

must mean that this
great mystery's been solved.

Yeah, I wish it was.

It's just getting
more complicated.

How so?

Ever see one of those
puzzles with the dots?

You look at the picture one
way, and you see one thing,

look at the same
picture another way,

and it looks
completely different?

Yup. Just about
every morning.

[Chuckling]: Yeah.

Look, I got
a question for you.

When you found Brooks
down by the water,

you did consider that he
might not have died naturally.

Oh, of course!

But there was no evidence
to suggest a homicide,

so we ruled it
natural causes.

You know, people die of
heart attacks every day.

Yeah. A guy doesn't talk,
or communicate with his wife,

for 5 years, then
one day shows up,

drives down to the waterfront,
and has a heart attack.

I don't buy it.

Come on.
Listen to me.

You know how this works.
You've been there!

You can't spend a week
on a dead-end case!

There's something
about this.

Just doesn't
sit well with me.

So he was
perfectly healthy,

other than his heart,
when you found him?

He had a nosebleed.

And I suppose
there was no blood test.

Nope! I didn't
see a need!

That's great, Oscar.

I get fired off the force

for bending some
stupid-ass off-duty rule,

and you won't lift
a finger to investigate?

There was nothing
to investigate!

And don't use
that tone with me!

Listen to me, Eddie.

That guy didn't die because
someone punched him in the nose.

The rental car.

Where'd it come from?

I'll get the
records to you.

All right. Do me
a favour, OK?

If there's still blood
in the car, have it tested.

All right.

All right.

Thanks for the beer.

Put it on his tab.

So, you can see why
I'm having trouble letting go.

I can't believe
what you just told me!

Sam disappears from
my life for 5 years,

and then he
shows up dead.

So you're not here
to buy real estate, are you?

No.

Looking for answers.

OK.

What have you found?

Well, apparently Sam remarried

to a woman named
Charlotte Porter.

They lived up in the hills

in this huge house.

I can't imagine
Sam living like that.

People do change.

You know Sam never
cared about material things.

He hated anything
ostentatious.

Chris, you knew Sam.

Do you believe that he would
have left me for another woman?

If you talk to a few
of my psychiatrist friends,

they'll tell you
we all lead

different lives
at different times.

Sometimes at
the same time.

Well, I guess I'm just
one of those simple people.

Did you ever meet
his sister Denise?

Wait. No!

I never knew
he had one!

Yeah, he, uh... always
sent her a birthday card.

I've tried finding her
house here in Detroit,

but there was a fire
a number of years ago.

I can't find out
what happened to her.

OK. Why do you
think that matters?

Uh, if I could find her,
maybe she could help?

Wait.

I really wish I could
help you more, Jean.

But I think...

You may be
making things worse.

I mean, you can't deny
the reality here!

Sam had another life!

I guess.

Ah, we should
get going. Come on.

Hey, you're back!

Hey!

How's everything?

Feel like I'm on
an emotional roller-coaster.

How was Chicago?

It's too early to tell.

Can I... can I talk
to you for a second?

Yeah!

All right. I gotta
ask you something.

OK.

I want you to go back

to the day before
your husband went missing.

What was
his mood like?

It seemed fine.

He said he was
gonna have a busy day.

He'd be home late.

Was he upset
about anything?

No. Actually, he was more
quiet than usual that day.

And when he returned?

He was just
tired. Uh...

He had a couple drinks
before going to bed,

which was
unusual for him.

There was something
that night. Um...

He got out of bed.
I had heard loud voices,

but I couldn't make out
what they were saying.

Did you recognize
who it was?

No.

By the time I got out
of bed, he was coming back.

He said one of the
neighbours was complaining

that he had blocked
their car in the driveway.

And you believed him?

Yeah, we had
difficult neighbours.

OK, now
the next day.

The day he
disappeared.

It was a Wednesday.
His day off.

How's your
crossword puzzle?

It's all right.

You all right?

Sure. Yeah, I'm fine.

You seem kind of distant.

I'm as good as gold.

So, you're going down
to the boat today?

Yeah.

Want me to come?

I can cancel lunch with Mom.

No, that's OK. There are...

...a few things I need
to do on the boat

before the season opens.

What is it, Sam?

Nothing.

I love you very much.


I love you too.

It was like he knew he was
never gonna see me again.

It was the last
time he held me.

They found our boat
out on the lake.

Sam was missing.

You know, Jean...

I don't think your husband
died of a heart attack.

I think someone
may have killed him.

Who?

I... the Sam I knew

was very well-liked,
very well-respected.

He was on the verge of
a new cancer treatment therapy.

How new?

Cutting-edge.

It was a drug protocol
never used in the US before.

Well...

That might have
been a great reason

someone wanted
to kill your husband!

People have killed
for a lot less.

Yup! Just got it.

Thank you so much,
Paul. I owe you one.

All right. Take care.

Who is he, exactly?

He's an ex-
colleague of mine.

He's a journalist
here in Detroit now.

Here it is.

Denise died in the fire.

Explains why
we can't find her.

May of 1999.

I'm sorry.

That was just
one month after Sam died.

What a coincidence.

Yeah.

So...

Where do we go from here?

Maybe you should go
back to your room now.

Do you want me to leave?

No.

Come back to bed!

No, I'm starving.
I wanna go down for breakfast.

Hey!

You're still here?

Chris!

So, uh... how's
everything going, Jean?

Oh, it's fine.

Good. I'm glad!

I thought your conference
was over yesterday!

Just some...
some last-minute details.

Listen, if you're both
free for dinner tonight,

would you be my guests?

I'm sorry, we've
got another engagement.

Thanks anyway, Doc.

Sure. No problem.

OK, I'll see you later!

OK.

You really shouldn't
be so hard on him.

No. Was I?

He's a good doctor,

and he's always been
a very good friend!

Well, I don't
like your friend.

You jealous?

Have I reason to be?

No, of course not.
It was a long time ago!

You've known him
for a while, huh?

Yeah, he introduced
Sam and I at a party.

Well, he's got slightly
different priorities than Sam.

Meaning?

I found out in Chicago

that Ricky Castor was
one of Sam's patients.

He had a rare form
of leukemia called ALL.

It's terminal.

Sam tried so hard
to help kids.

He did more than try.
He was paying

for Ricky's
expensive drug treatment

out of his own pocket!

When Sam went missing,

the boy was referred
to your friend.

He wasn't as generous.

The father couldn't afford
the drugs, and the boy died.

He was 10.

That's interesting.

Charlotte Porter's house is
owned by BFA Medical Supplies,

but it's headquartered
in the Cayman Islands.

The corporate veil.

When they wanna disguise
who owns the company.

You mean she's
hiding something.

I still don't understand Sam's
involvement in all of this.

So what does
that leave us?

An address.

And here it is.

The local office in Detroit.

Let's go around back.

So it's on
the second floor.

Here it is.

There we go!

Yeah, it's OK.

Syringes, gauze...

It's all
medical supplies.

Yeah.

I'm gonna take
a look in the back.

OK.

It's all from Mexico!

Doesn't seem to be
any paperwork.

Eddie?

Dammit! Let's go, Jean!

What's wrong?

There's a camera there.

Let's go, come on!

You OK?

Look, Eddie.

There's liquid
inside these bubbles.

We're gonna
get this tested.

-Eddie!

Oscar! Yeah, hey, it's Eddie.

Look, I need you
to do me a favour, all right?

I need you to find me a lab
here in Detroit ASAP.

-Right.

Call me when you find it?

Yes.
OK.

I came to Detroit

to find out the truth
behind Sam's choices,

but clearly, we're involved
in something illegal.

What are we getting into?

We're close
to the truth, Jean.

I don't know if
I wanna know the truth.

Hold on.

Just keep it, OK?
Hold on!

Eddie, I'm
pulling the plug.

Sam's dead, there's
nothing I can do about it.

I just wanna go
back to Chicago.

Please, wait. Look,
just give me a few hours.

Let me go
to the lab, and we'll...

we'll talk
when I get back.

Call me if you
need to, all right?

Jean, look at me.

Everything is gonna
be just fine, OK?

Trust me.

I'm sticking with you
till this is over.

OK.

OK.

OK.

Mrs. Brooks?

Yeah?

This fax came in
marked "urgent,"

for either you
or Mr. Fate.

Thank you.

"Subject's coronary arrest

"brought on by extremely
high levels of drug Arzac,

"an ephedrine derivative
for treatment of leukemia."

Where in the world
did you find this?

What is it?

Hello?

-Jean, first and final warning.

Leave Detroit now,
or you will both get hurt.

Who is this?

Hello?

Eddie, come back to the hotel.

Jean, you OK? What's wrong?

Please come. I'm scared.

I got a threatening phone call.

Stay in your room.
I'll be right there!

Jean, it's Eddie! Open up!

What happened?

I got a call.
What'd they say?

They were very clear.

They said to get out
of Detroit or else.

Look, we got the
fax from Ortuso.

Sam died of an overdose.

He was injected
with a drug called Arzac.

Arzac? Is that
what you said?

Yeah, it's right there
on the blood test.

The liquid in the bubbles
we found was Arzac.

The woman at
the lab said

it's extremely rare
and illegal here in the States.

They killed him.

You know,
I think it's time

I pay Charlotte Porter
another visit.

No. We have to
go to the police.

We will, but
we need more proof first.

Then I'm
coming with you.

OK.

All right.

Jean, wait!

You stay in the car.

No, I'm
coming with you!

It's safer.
Then you stay!

All right.

There's someone there!

I told you
I don't like that guy.

Wait. Jean! Jean, wait!

Come on!

Weren't you supposed to keep
an eye on her at the hotel?

I did. I told her
to forget about Sam

and go back
to Chicago.

Then why are they sneaking
around the property?

Guess I wasn't
persuasive enough.

Anyway...

This puts an
end to it all.

Hold on, hold on.

Don't move!

[Eddie]: Stay back, Jean!

Who are you?

What do you want?

Unh!

Well, well.

Seems our hero is coming to!

Jean.

Where's Jean?

Don't worry
about our merry widow.

We've got business to discuss.

What do you want?

How come I'm not
already in a body bag?

I wanna be sure I'm not
trading one problem for another.

I'm a businessman, Mr. Fate.

I thought you were a doctor.

You really don't know
when to shut up, do you?

And that big mouth of yours

is exactly what
I'm concerned about.

You see, I don't wanna
get rid of you,

and have your buddy Ortuso
breathing down my neck tomorrow.

How much does he know?

You're gonna kill me anyway.

Maybe so!

But our good friend Mrs. Brooks

is currently getting better
acquainted with Charlotte.

See?

All I have to do is
press this little button here,

and Jean will experience
the wonders of Arzac.

You're bluffing!

Maybe.

But do you wanna take that risk?

The choice is yours!

See, if you cooperate,

we'll only need one body bag.

If you don't...

we're gonna need two.

I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

COME HERE!

Don't move!

I think we can come to
an understanding here, Mr. Fate.

You disgust me.

How can you cash in
on other people's misery?

How do you sleep at night?

When patients
dying of cancer

are willing to pay
the high price for a drug

that I know can
save their lives,

why should I give up
the opportunity for a profit?

Because it's illegal.

Illegal?

So you mean to tell me
that in your work,

you never bend the rules
a little for the greater good?

I've never killed
anyone for money!

We didn't kill
Sam for money!

We didn't
have a choice.

He wouldn't keep
to his part of the deal.

Deal?

What-- what deal?

If he didn't come on board,

Jean would meet with
an unfortunate accident!

What? So you
traded Jean's life

for Sam's co-operation?

How did you drag him into this?

Well, he was the one
that discovered the drug.

In a research lab in Mexico.

He was the only one that
could bring it into the country.

Now Charlotte...

Charlotte saw
the opportunity immediately.

She didn't need to wait
7 years for FDA approval.

It was her
idea, really.

We needed him.

Why did you kill him?

Part of the deal

was that he was to forget
about his life in Chicago.

Permanently.

We set up the boating accident.

Everything worked
beautifully... for a while.

But that fool...
he couldn't forget about her.

Jean.

He knew what would happen

if he went back.

But he couldn't
live without her.

So he didn't get
to live at all.

We couldn't take the chance
they'd go to the police!

If he'd been able
to forget about Jean...

He'd still be alive today.

Where is she?

Where is she?
You tell me where she is!

Where is she?

Save your energy.

HELP!

HELP!

Shh. Save your breath.

There's no one around
here who can hear you.

What did you do to Eddie?

Don't worry about Eddie.

I'm sure he and Chris

are coming to
some kind of understanding.

What are you talking about?
What understanding?

I'm talking--

Excuse me.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Brooks.

It looks like the
negotiations fell through.

Well, I know you've
always been keen

on wondering what
happened to dear Sam.

Well...

I'm gonna satisfy
your curiosity.

Arzac. Does wonders
on cancerous cells.

And on the right dosage,

it does wonders on
uncooperative elements.

So you killed Sam just because

he wouldn't go through with
your little business venture?

No, it's...
not so little, actually.

I'm talking about millions
and millions of dollars here.

What an idiot!

He knew the risks.

And he still couldn't live

without his
precious little wife.

My little brother

always loved you too much.

Denise?

NO!


NO!

Drop it. DROP IT!

Don't move!

I SAID, DON'T MOVE!

Are you OK?

You all right?

The cops are
on their way.

Are you OK?

I'm all right. You OK?

Yeah.

It's all right. It's OK.

It's OK.

Do you remember me?

Yes. You left
before I finished!

Could you do
a reading now?

Please, have a seat.

The last judgement.

There is a change in your world.

A renewal of good.

Lovers.

There's a new love
in your life, and with it

comes the choice
to accept it, or not.

The chariot.

It refers to travel.

Hmm. A long trip.

This is all very good.

This is a very wonderful card.

The magician. It refers
to your capacity to love.

It's good that you came back.

Thank you.

So how did it go?

Well, she said we're
gonna have a lot of kids.


Let's start
with Milan first.

OK.
