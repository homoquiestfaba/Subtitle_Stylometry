<i>Immortals. They have hidden among
you for thousands of years</i>

<i>Drifting thru' time</i>

<i>Locked in a deadly game
of combat where death...</i>

<i>...only comes with
the loss of their head.</i>

<i>Unable to have children, their
origin are shrouded in mystery.</i>

<i>Where do the Immortals come from?
Why are they here?</i>

<i>Some believe the answers are
to be found in the source.</i>

<i>A legend whispered among them
of where immortality began.</i>

HIGHLANDER: THE SOURCE

Somewhere in eastern Europe.
NEAR FUTURE.

Duncan McLeod. HIGHLANDER.
IMMORTAL.

[ Siren wailing ]

Outer walls of the city.

Zae Jef. HIGHLANDER.
IMMORTAL.

[ Heavy breathing ]

[ Heavy breathing continues ]

[ Woman shouting in distance ]

[ Distant shouting continoues ]

Hyah! Hyah!

Agh!
[ Woman screaming ]

Agh!

[ Crash ]

Wait!

[ Heavy breathing ]

Have you looked thru' them?

Are you sure you are not nervous?

Can't Mrs Mcleod be nervous?

Hannah.

[ Eerie sounds ]

Are you on?
Try and listen to warp sign.

Regie.
Calm down and tell me what's going on.

After the past week, the planets
of our solar system have moved..

...out of their natural paths
and coming into alignment.

I mean do you know
how unusual that is.

There is no simple way
to explain this.

<i>But that could just be
an orbital wobble.</i>

How can that be possible?

Orbital wobble is one thing.
But this?

This is a subtle celestial mechanics.

[ Beeping ]

Listen the whole...actually millions
of celestial bodies...

<i>...from here to the central sun of
our organic seal are lining up.</i>

When that allignment is complete...

...it's exactly 4 days, 3 hours
and 47 minutes.

<i>The earth is gonna be bombarded
with cosmic radiation.</i>

The month of the source.

The life of the cosmos is
literarily reaching out to us.

Right. What a bout Zae?
Did we hear from him?

No. No.
He's overdue.

[ # ]

Dean Mcleod is...is not
the man he once was.

<i>Well just try.</i>

Anna Temora, MORTAL.

[ Siren wailing in distance ]

I can't stay with you Duncan.
Why?

Duncan

[ Eerie whispering ]

[ Heavy breathing ]

CENTRAL COMM TOWER.
EAST EUROPEAN END.

[ Siren blaring ]

[ Metal clangs ]

Hey, Hey you.
Please something to eat.

Oh God thank you. Thank you
Thank you.

[ Girl screaming in distace ]

[ bell clang ]

Hey!

Stop!
No

No! No! No! No!
[ Gunshot ]

[ Gunshot continues ]
aaah.

Thank you.

[ Dog barking in distance ]

Ugh. Hi.
Hi.

Is it good?
Uhuh.

[ Dog barking in distance ]

[ Heavy breathing ]
What is that?

[ Static ]

Yes.

<i>Voice march accepted.</i>

There can be only one.

<i>Login confirmed.
Connected.</i>

Yes.

<i>System required.</i>

<i>- Are you sure when the alignment will be complete
Four days at most.</i>

[ Crowd shouting ]

They are going crazy out there.

<i>I suspect some big messy thing
are all going down the toilet.</i>

Aaah!

<i>Reg, where the hell've you been man?
Reg, there's no time.</i>

<i>It's coming down here.
I think I found it.</i>

<i>Where is Giovanni?
What do you find Zae?</i>

I found ancient writings in Gaza.

<i>I followed them, they took
me to central Europe.</i>

And I found the location of the source.

[ Static ]

<i>Zaeman, I'm losing you man.
Try and stabilize your signal.</i>

<i>- Zae, easy okay. From the beginning.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.</i>

Zae, you do God's work, don't be afraid.

<i>- Your eminence.</i>

Tell us what you found.

The ancient writings I found in Gaza.

I followed them.

They took me to central Europe.

Then I knew I was getting closer.

I found a monastry where the
monks studied an ancient...

...that spoke of the source.

One of the monks took me to a place where
it last happened over 2000 years ago.

<i>I feel the power of this place.
[ Horn playing] </i>

Then he appeared.

So I ran.
And I ran.

He has risen.
The gaurdian.

[ Static ]

[ Static continues ]

This is weird. No

[ Computer keybord click sounds ]

<i>Reaquire signal.</i>

<i>Signal reaquired.</i>

<i>- He's the immortal antichrist.</i>

I suppose the guardian was bullshit.

The false prophet created in evil.

Well if he's such a bad boy,
why did't he take Zae's head?

To get to us.
He knows Zae's not alone.

<i>- We must.</i>

You think he knows we are looking for the source?

Signal acquired.

Zae, where is the location of the source?

<i>- He's more than a immortal.</i>

<i>- He's like...like death.
Zae, you're in danger.</i>

<i>Zae.
The location.</i>

He's coming.

Zae! Get outta there.

<i>What have you learnt?
Give us something.</i>

I made the co-ordinates down
on this map.

The co-ordinates are...
The co-ordinates are on...

<i>to the monastry.</i>

Okay! How to get

<i>You have to find a crest with the
symbol of Delio brothers of Janeil.</i>

the source.

<i>They will help you find</i>

<i>- Zae, you have to get out of there.
Zae, we have enought. Save youself.</i>

[ Static ]

<i>Pray for me. Father.</i>

<i>- Did you get the signal back?
Did you get the signal back?</i>

<i>Zae!
Zae! Huh!</i>

Brothers over pain.

<i>- What does he ever mean by Delio Brothers?</i>

Sounds like a firm bunch.

order in ancient Europe.

<i>The're an ancient religious</i>

They are not a religious order.

cult.

<i>They are an heretical</i>

But their elder might
be able to help us.

<i>The elder corrupted his monks.</i>

<i>Turned them from the true
faith during the fall of Rome.</i>

Rome is a long time ago my friend.

Not for me, it wasn't.

Giovanni,
this could be it.

Guys. If the elder could help us,
who gives a toss?

Let's go and find him.

He counted himself in.
He's got a shot, right?

[ Jazz Music playing ]

[ Phone ringing ]

Joe.

Pitosh, What d'you got?

<i>Find Mcleod.</i>

The guardian is awake.

[ Snickering ]

[ Mortorcycle revving.]

Yeah, can be only one.

Awakening!

[ Blasts and rumbling ]

[ Rumbling continues ]

Ah! Huh! Thank God.

Hello.

In the end of time.

Oh! Oh! Oh! You think I'm mad.
Maybe a little bit crazy.

What are you?
I'm the guardian.

Question is "who are you".

<i>- I'm Duncan McLeod.</i>

I'm Duncan McLeod.

[ Snickering ]
I'm Duncan McLeod. I'm Duncan McLeod.

I'm Duncan McLeod.

You have squandered a
preciou gift.

You could have ruled the world.
Then you passed it away.

Have a nice day.
The female Hannah...

...she's not for you.
What has Hannah got to do with this?

Nothing, Everything.Nothing, Everything.
Nothing, Everything.

It's time for me and you to dance.
In that outfit?

Foreplay.

[ Groaning ]
Let's go.

Yummy.

Are you the one, Mcleod?
Would you kill to be the one?

Would you kill?

[ Car revving ]

Oh Joe!

Joe.
Get in the car.

-Get out of here Joe.
I don't have time or this bullshit.

Get in the car!
What are you doing Jo...[ Gunshot fired ]

[ Groans ]

[ Car revs and accelerates. ]

<i>See the source.</i>

[ Door opens ]

[ Dogs barking in distance ]

What?

<i>- Seek the source</i>

The source.

[ Gasps ]

Joe.

Look. Before you get all
whacked out, just listen.

Joe, stop the car.
Stop the damn cAR.

You're a watcher.
You can't interfere.

I just said fuck it.
You took an oath.

There is no watcher organisation
anymore.

Most of my people are dead.

You shouldn't have interfered.

By heck, you'd be dead.

You're fine.Go ahead.
Go back and let that thing kill you.

<i>What do you have to live for anyway?</i>

He mentioned Hannah.

Have you even talked to her?

No. Not in months. And don't give me
any of that end of days bullshit.

Me and Thonson don't think it's
bullshit.

Oh the source.

<i>- They're looking for the source</i>

Now you can join them and
find out what it's about.

<i>And what it has to do with hannah.</i>

<i>Or you can go back and play with that freak.
It's you call.</i>

I can't believe you are about to drag me into this.

I don't know how to explain this, but, I'm immortal.

It's just a dream

I was born in the Island of scotland in 1592

This is more than a dream Duncan.

Hanna, nothing will hurt you.

Are you gonna grow old?
This is how I am.

I don't wanna grow old though.

<i>- I'll always love you.</i>

Will you still love me when I grow old?

I'm leaving. I cant stay with you Duncan.

Why?

You mean everything to me.

But it's not enough.
What do you mean I mean everything to you ...

...but it's not enough?

That doesn't make sense Anna
I can't!

What do you want from me?

The Impossible.

<i>I want a child.
A child.</i>

<i> A child.</i>

It's so good to see you Jay.

Who are you?
I'm Duncan McLeod.

Mcleod, Mcleod.
May I ask you what you're doing here?

Rottiweller.

Mastron.

I'm part time stereo-cultural type.
Sure,you are.

Funny. Who's that?
That's Joe Dolson. Friend of mine.

Hey.

Hey you pals. It's a long time.

This is different.

Times are different McLeod.
Yeah. That is a really good look for you Matus.

Giovanni.

I hear you're around requesting the source.

We are here to get information.

A brave man dying to get us this far.

Brothers of Deleil.

Rumours have it they've been governed
by the same elder for thousands of years.

One of us?

I think so.

Well let's find out.

What's a man of the cloth doing
on the quest for the source.

I am here for the greater glory of God.

But if you don't like what you find?

You assume there will be
an inherent contradiction between Makiwell..

...and Gunther, and the Gospel.

I know that will not be the case.
You seem to be very sure of that.

Doesn't? The Lord guides our
hands on this holy quest.

We are all in His service.

Question is, Duncan McLeod...

Are you?

I had a sneaky suspicion you'd know where to find me.
Yeah, well.

You know I did it for him
and not for you.

Sure.

[ Knocks ]

[ Window opens ]

What do you want?

We have no elder.

We have come to see your elder.

That went well.

[ Shouting ]
Oi! You! Open this door!

Right.

Aaah.

Aah!
[ Groans ]

Wait a minute.

Who's that?

That's my wife.

Hello.

I can explain.
[ Crash ]

Up!

The elder will see you.
Now that he is here.

Hello Annasticiaca.

Hello Duncan Mcleod.

You look like shit.

What are you doing here?

Look I have so much to tell you.

Later.

<i>- You won't believe what's been happening to me</i>

Duncan I have visions.
Huh.

Seriously. I saw these. I saw you.
I saw all of you.

<i>Come here.</i>

What are you talking about?

[ Deep guttural sounds ]

[ Groans ]

Look well.

[ Groans continues ]

There are worse things than death.

Apparently.

What do you want?
We seek the source.

[ Coughs and laughs ]

Are you willing to pay the price?
[ Laughs ]

[ Door slams ]
[ Gun cocks ]

That's fixed.
Thank you.

Hoo! Hello.
Yeah. That's a sweet piece.

But this is my bee, okay Regie?
Alright.

What is it?

I don't know.

Sure you haven't come to the guardian.

A riddle that cannot be solved.

A force that cannot be defeated

Man, that's one fast bird.

Stay here.

I'll like to take care of this.

I was once like you.

Long ago, before recorded time.

Like now, the world had fallen into chaos.

The people cried out
for a redeemer.

Do any of you have redeeming quality?
[ Chuckles ]

[ Eerie whispering ]

This is holy ground.

We were a group much like yours.

<i>All of us Immortals...</i>

<i>...from different tribes
all seeking the truth.</i>

<i>We all thought we would find
the answer in the source.</i>

But there were darker, secret
desires in our hearts.

<i>The journey was long.</i>

<i>Our tempers flared
and being immortals...</i>

<i>...heads were taken.</i>

<i>Finally, there were only three of us left.</i>

<i>The strongest of our kind.</i>

<i>But the ancient one gaurding the source...</i>

<i>...was stronger still.</i>

<i>My friend fought valiantly...</i>

...but I wanted my immortality.

<i>The source wasn't mine to take.</i>

<i>Something went terribly wrong.</i>

<i>It left us both cursed.</i>

<i>Both, for ever...</i>

<i>...decayed.</i>

Me like this.

<i>his place as the guardian.</i>

And he doomed to take

The guardian!
I love it.

<i>Who wants to live forever?</i>

<i>Who wants to live forever.</i>

Can you tell us the way
to the source?

[ Chuckles ]
You should ask her.

she's already seeing the way.

<i>Come.</i>

Anna.

It's alright.

[ Groans ]
Child...

...it calls to you.
Does it not?

This is blasphemy.
It is pride!

Don't touch her.
Okay. It's okay.

Aaah!

Follow the signs.

As for you lot...

...follow the woman.

Come Anna, what did you see?
Stars.

<i>- A warning.</i>

World.

<i>As you get closer to the source...</i>

...you will grow weaker.

What's in it for you?

Realese.

<i>Realese.</i>

Aah!

Yeah.

There can be the only one.

Maybe. But they weren't
talking about you.

[ Guardian ] Joe

[ Gunshot fired ]

Hey come on.

Have a shot.

Come on.

Aah!

Aghrr!

[ Gunshot continues ]

Ouch.

McLeod!

Noooo!
Aah!

You!

Joe!
Joe!

Thank you everyone for the
audience. Good night.

Joe! Get me a bandage.

[ Breathing in gasps ]

Come on someone.
Do something.

You shouldn't have interfered.

McLeod, it's you.
Watch you.

It's been my greatest.

McLeod you...

...are my...

...best friend.

You are the father that
never keep me out.

[ Sobbing ]

You can be the only one.

There's nothing there for me.
[ Laughs ]

You can't be left back.

It's your destiny.

Don't.

Amen.

[ Altogether ]
Amen.

Amen.

I'm done.

Didn't go quite as planned, huh?

Don't Becli.
Not now.

Why are you upset Mcleod?

Is it because Joe died because you
the great Islander couldn't save him.

Go to hell.
It's for you Mcleod.

Someone's betray the memory of his friend?
Betray history and his clan?

This is holy ground.

I dont care.
No.

It's what we do.

You know why he interfered?
Why? It wasn't for me.

It was for you.

So that you might be the one.

And now you're gonna piss on his grave?
Well come on.

You can hide behind that bullshit Mitos.
But if you're looking for someone to blame...

...blame yourself.

We're leaving.
No. I'm not.

I have to go with them.
What?

It's not your choice Duncan, it's mine.
Anna.

I need to find the source.
What do you want?

You want me to bury you next to Joe?

You stay with me.

You said nothing would hurt me.

I was chosen for this.
And so are you.

Anna, this doesn't make sense?
Yes, it does.

Look.

It calls to us.

I saw it before.

But...it was over me
like a cathedral.

Benji.

Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

Where?

Water.

We need to go by water.

<i>The alignment is seen over an island.</i>

Like the lady said.

We need a boat.

[ Door creaks open ]

I thought you'd have found
someone else to have kids with.

I don't want just someone's kids.

Duncan.

I made a choice.

It went against everything
I felt for you.

You think it's a coincidence
we ran into each other?

Something, some power is
guiding us.

Can that power bring Joe back?

I... I..
[ Sighs ]

We need to dive.

Impossible.

Why?
Look. Over there...

<i>There are maniacs on the Island.
Cowbulls.</i>

<i>They must have seen the
estern seaboard.</i>

Captain Boniwee. The freighter captain.
I have no wish to join him.

We have no choice.

The lady has a date.

There is nothing there than death,
There's death everywhere.

[ Men talking and laughing ]

No, no, no, no
Yeah.

Oh yeah, yeah.

May God take his soul.

[ Laughing ] light

<i>We're not gonna let them
do that. Are we?</i>

No we're not.

It's got to stop. Now!

[ Gunshots fired ]

Aaah!

Oh, oh ouh.

What are you doing?

God is mercy.
Even in death.

[ Anna screams ]
Duncan!

Duncan!

Aaah!

Help me. Come on. Help me.
Please.

[ Man screaming ]
Oh no. Aaaah!

[ Screaming continues ]

Everyone get down!

So here we are.

<i>[ Rock music playing ] We are princes of the universe</i>

Born to be kings.

<i>Here we belong.
Fighting to survive</i>

<i>In a world with the darkest hour.</i>

[ Music raises to upbeat ]

<i>And here we are
At the precinct of the Universe.</i>

<i>Here we belong</i>

<i>Fighting for survival</i>

<i>We're here to be the ruler
Oh yeah.</i>

<i>Where...</i>

[ Rock music fades to stop]
[ Car revs to a stop ]

[ Car doors close ]

Damn it. There are suprises
everyday.

Two house.

Where are we going?
Okay.

<i>It looks as if we are meant to
keep going to...</i>

We keep going east, right?

Right.

<i>Mr Mcleod...</i>

<i>...thanks for saving my neck in
that dark alley.</i>

<i>You didn't really
give me much choice.</i>

Or did you Regie?
Did what?

<i>Find anything?</i>

<i>More bodies.</i>

Did you find any food?
Nothing.

Christ oh fucking mighty. I'm starving.
Do not blaspheme.

Or what?

Is your good Lord gonna come
by here and slap me. Is He?

Wake up Jay.

Look around ya.

<i>I'm afraid.</i>

My old friend, But He has
not turned His back on us.

Only we have turned
away from Him.

Still, the rose chicken
will be nice.

What do you think McLeod?

Have we come to this
because of who we are?

We live.
We learn.

But as if we don't learn.
Do we?

We were given the ultimate
responsibility. Free will.

And what have we done
with it?

We watch generation after generation
making the same mistakes

The source is His gift to us.

Through it, one of us may be
reborn into something more.

More than immortal?

Perhaps.

Perhaps the sanctimonous
bullshit Giovanni.

You don't know where the source is.
No one does. Even if it exists.

How can we know we're gonna
get to the source anyways?

Maybe the gaurdian will kill us
before we reach it.

That's if we don't kill each other
first.

<i>- No.</i>

That could happen.

It's not about death.
It's about life.

Alright.

Okay everyone sleep some.

Sergeant Richard Rotweiller reporting for duty ma'am.
[ Anna chucles ]

You look cold. You want some?
Warms the blood.

Please.

Thanks.

So how old are you?

I'll be 314 years old three weeks
from next Tuesday.

I'm just a waylad compared to
Giovanni and Miltos.

You're a smart guy Regie.

How come you don't believe me now?
What makes you say that lady?

When people think you're bit
of a cabbage...

...they tend to
underestiment you.

That's good for keeping one's head on
the shoulder if you're immortal.

If you know what I mean.

Yeah.

Why are you here?

For the trophy.

[ Grass rustling ]

I saw you.

You're supposed to get
some sleep.

I know what Joe meant to you.

I've spent my entire life...

...watching the people I love die.

All the ones I love.

Hael, Gesa, Joe.
All of them

I kept telling myself...

I'm an immortal.

It was the price I pay.

But deep down inside
I always believed...

...that one day
the libel will come out.

I will know why I spent the last 400 years
cutting peoples' head to survive.

I would know why I am what I am.

I haven't lived like you.

I haven't seen what you've seen

McLeod, coming this far
is for a reason.

It's not about you.

Come on.

Come on.

Someone is gonna kill this thing.

Uh.
Hello Regie.

How did you do that?
How did you do that? How did you do that?

How did you do that?

I'm supposed to feel you coming.

Flesh.
Flesh

So delicate.

You are...
Fuck you.

[ Gunshots fired ]

[ Gunshots continues ]

Regie!

Regie.

[ Gasping ]

<i>Why didn't he take his head?
Why didn't we know he was here?</i>

How do we get him in the car?

He should be alive by now, right?

<i>- As you get closer to the source...</i>

Why isn't he coming back?

...you will grow weaker.

[ Car brakes to a halt ]
[ Car doors open ]

Regie!
[ Groans ]

Regie!

Oh my God.
He's dead.

It's happening.
He didn't hear it because his faith was unpure.

Let's see how your wounds heal brother.
Aaah!

Natus!

Giovanni!
Stop it.

Amen.

We should go. Hurry Matus. We're going.
Before.

It's all bullshit anyway. There
can be only one. The source.

It's all but a lie.

Yeah maybe it isn't.

Maybe it's a story we made up to make
ourselves feel better at night.

Yeah maybe the way the three meant.

You don't believe it
Yeah why not?

We're mortals now.
Everything is changed.

[ Screechng sounds in distance ]

[ Duncan ] Now what?

[ Mitos ] I don't like it.

[ Anna ] He's alive.

[ Jay ] This is a trap.

Be careful.

[ Groans ]

Aaagh!

[ Explosion ]
Aaah!

Get Out! Get Out! Get Out!
Open the door.

[ Jay ] I told you it was a trap.
[ Mitos ] Yeah! Yeah! I know!

[ Duncan ] Get out! Now! Go! Go!

[ Explosion ]
[ Duncan ] Aaghr!

[ Gauardian laughing ]
Hee hee he ha ha ha.

We are they?
Over us.

They're using the trees.

[ Men Shouting ]
Don't let them go! Behind them!

This way! This way!

They gathering across!

[ Man laughing ]

The heroes.

Take them.

For meat.

[ Arrows shot ]

[ Anna ] Aah!

Aaaah!

Oh!

<i>[ Man talking ]
There's nowhere to go.</i>

[ Guardian laughing ]

[ Drumming ]
[ Crowd cheering ]

Fucking bastards.
You come here.

[ Woman screaming ]

This can't be the end.

God wouldn't let this happen
to a true christian.

You know Giovanni...

...I saw Christ.

...teach His own.

You self-centered sonofabitch...

...you are no christian.

Anna.

I never saw this.

We'll be Okay?

I don't know.

It's okay.

[ Woman screaming ]
[ Crowd cheering ]

<i>[ Anna ] The eastern drunkard.</i>

I saw it before.

Hello.

Aaah.

How do you like being mortal?

It cold be worse.
I could be you.

[ Giggles ]

Gallows you more.
That's funny.

That's very very funny.

I like you McLeod.

Enough of the bullshit
bullshit.

I have very high hopes for you.

Yeah then kill me, piss.

Leave her alone.

Anna.

<i>Woman come.</i>

<i>The source calls you.</i>

Follow me now or
I kill 'em all.

Anna don't listen to him.

Anna.

Come for me.

Anna.

Anna no.

[ Mitos ] We never should have
turned to be mortals.

It's burning the rope.

Oh, It's setting me free.

[ Mitos ] Giovanni...

It's releasing me.

[ Duncan ]Giovanni.
Come on Giovanni.

[ Mitos ] Cut the ropes.

There can be only one.

[ Mitos ] Giovanni!

[ Mitos ] Giovanni bastard!

[ Groaning ]

[ Crowds cheering ]

I can't leave you here.

I need someone to watch my back.

You trust me?

You'll do.

I am the one.

[ Giovanni ]
It's so close to me.

[ Man Shouting ]
They took off.

They have escaped
[ Crowd cheering ]

[ Motorcycle revving ]

Hey.

It's really happening.

[ Gunshot ], [ Bullet ricotchetes ]
[ Duncan ] Go!

[ Giovanni groans ]

[ Man laughing ]
You gonna be meat, ha! ha! ha!

[ Giovanni ] Forgive me father
for I have sinned.

What do you think?

Can.

[ Man talking ] Ready to die freak?
[ Giovanni ] Groans.

[ Swords clanging ]

[ Mitos ] Giovanni go.

[ Duncan ] Giovanni!

Giovanni!

Go. Find Anna.
What?!

It is you McLeod.

I wanted it to be me, but...

...you're the best of us.

You're totally human, totally
incorruptible and Joe knew and...

...I know it's you.

You're such an asshole.

I never said I wasn't here.

Go.
Mitos.

[ Mitos shouting ]
Race me!

Yeah!

[ Giovanni muttering ]
The source!

Almost there.

I'm almost there.

The entrance!

I await your blessing.

[ Guardian ] Rise Giovanni.

This is real.

And...

Yes.

I am the one.

No.

[ Thud ]

[ Duncan] Anna.

Anna.

Anna.

Duncan. I knew you would come.

Come on.

Come on.

Whoa!

Get out of my way.

There's more deaad ways McLeod.

You can't just run away
with the woman.

So why don't you just tell me
how it works.

In your world,
One of us has to die.

I've heared death before.

Come on.

Duncan.

Duncan!

Anna!

[ Guardian ] Prize!

What is this?

It's not time.

Face the guardian
Yeah, face the guardian.

Attaboy.
