A year ago

I'll do everything you say.

I confess that your comment -

Brings you closer to the reverence
which is due to him.

I surrender myself to
you, for I am yours.

Thus, teacher man, so
long as it lives.

Well, you're back.
You look good.

Dav, Russell.
Hi, Jeffrey.

This one's from the boss.
You sweat?

Are you nervous here
the first day.

It's my coffee!
Drink it in the car.

I want to sit and ...
Come on.

So it will be shown
no more wrong.

Everything all right?
This is gold.

The beautiful Diane Stringer.
A pensioner with volunteering.

Well-liked, single, likes a glass of
white wine at the weekend, etc, etc.

Sexual activity?
We are still waiting
for answers to tests.

Do we have lacked a mother?

My childhood was
not super, but I

Have you found anything?
There are no fingerprints.

Thinking we two the same?
Hardly.

Masks and a clean crime scene.

A perfectly prepared bed.

Ask friends, it is true.

Will you send this to the
laboratory, Bobby?

We have found nothing.

I will take over.

It lay under a pile of soil.
It was not very well hidden.

It was certainly
not my intention.

I think our friend has
come back, Russell.

Speaking of friends.
.. Ah, shit, Jeffrey.

Hi, Amanda.

Do you remember Russell?
What have found?

An arm.

I did not know that you ...
Now I'm here then.

I got your card.
Good.

It was good enough not much.
It was you who dropped me.

It could well have gone better.

Elvis!

So I am home.

Go ahead.

A punctured lung

So there is a sick
asshole among us.

Of course no one has
seen anything.

Either he knew her,
or he got access.

Check out all the area's
sex crimes, Jamie.

Check the relatives and friends
in our directory.

Do we him as a serial killer?

It is not a sex criminal.
I think he is impotent.

What is he?
I do not know.

Is he a serial killer?
I do not know.

Okay, everybody.
Let's get started.

Let me just talk
to you, Russell.

Do you think you are ready to return?
You seem confused.

No, I analyzes just
what we have.

Come to the meeting at.
15th There shall be composed
of a workgroup.

What should you do with me?

If you are self-centered, you are reasonably
clever and good to spar with.

Somewhat clever?

"Maybe I can suck it
on to you later."

Five minutes.

Go out and get some lunch, you know.
Do I know this? How nice.

It was damn kindly meant.
Yes, rend me.

Should I now also have your food?
Is it where we are?

Sorry, Detective Spivey.

Now I do not interfere, right?
No sooner.

Can we ...?
May I speak with you alone?

Yes. Come here.

What about to sit here?
It's fine.

What's wrong? You look worried.

Sorry, but I can not
see a checkmark.

I miss you!

Okay ...

That I received from
my wife yesterday.

You must understand ...
No. Would you explain me this?

You have said that
my wife is dead.

It is a reasonable assumption
given what we found.

The police should probably
not assume anything.

No, but in light of ...
What if she is alive?

It can she possibly be.
You have to help me.

I would also like to, but she
can not possibly be alive.

The letter may have driven
around the system and

It is dated yesterday.

It has been my life's worst years.
Be nice to help me.

I can not bear to live
through this again.

You must do something.
What if she is alive.

Okay ...

For your sake I look
at the case.

It is the only thing
that is sent

It is sent from a
wireless network.

Do you know where?
I'm working on it.

I must go. Mailer you to me?
Yes. Goodbye.

Sorry. So I am here.

Despite the number of wishes
that we say serial murders?

Whether the two murders are not a series?
No, it's a couple.

This one is only an assumption.
But there are not many
similarities ...

Shall we gather a working group and
use the many treasures one million?

Why should he be impotent?

Well, it's just a guess ...

Box finally panic with a story.

What are you also here?
I'm sparring partner.

Have you nothing to join,

Well, I have since ...

I understand your reluctance
to assemble a working group.

It is an email from John Tyler's
wife, dated yesterday.

This is what is left of
Rebecca Tyler, sir.

Is she dead?
Probably.

Is she alive, it would seem
rather foolish not

What would you suggest?

I think we should resume the Tyler
case, look at Stringer-murder -

And investigate cases
in parallel.

There are some similarities ...
Calling sites were cleaned.

Cut off limbs, trophies ...
She believes masks.

I know. Is it the lips?
It's Rebecca.

Think you can handle this?
Last flipped you off course.

Freaked's so much to say
but I feel better now.

So get into it, which will.
Have you else need anything?

No thanks, that's fine, sir.

Can I get my badge
and my gun, sir?

Your sign is here.
Thank you.

Did you do your own gun?
Shall we go to it again?

Is it away, you find a stick.

Your asshole ...

Thank you.

What are we here?
There is something
about the carpet.

I have presented a videotape
on your table.

Just after the notch in the film, I am
sure you can see one in the mirror.

Look at it and contact me.

Would you like to help me
move the table, Jeffrey?

What are you doing?
Safely. We'll pay.

Buy a new carpet.

There is a notch on the survivors
encompassing the devel nd.

I think the guy off camera -

Lifted the curtain
and wrote it here.

I surrender myself to
you, for I AM YOUR

Yes, it's blood.

He has marked his territory.

Do you have any fire?
Do not smoke here.

Why not?

Should I be forced to
be passive smoker?

Then you're back in the saddle.
How is it?

It's been a wonderful time now
is overridden by the job.

You have to give it some time.

The conversations here only
works if you want.

I thrive here. I must not smoke

How's the drinking?

I can almost get the passport
within a day.

It is hard, but you gotta
have some goals, right?

Your problems will adhere
to the wound is healed -

And it happens only when you
start to tell something.

I said yes.
Have you met her?

Who?

Yes.

How did you feel?

I felt like a complete idiot.

Will you try to describe it with emotions?
"I felt ..."

I felt I lost control, I felt shame.
..

What are you ashamed of?

Here is William Shakespeare's
collected works.

Is there anything else you want?
No, thank you for your help.

I never understood that
shit at college.

It's like good wine.
It becomes better with time.

It is you might become.

WHAT IS YOUR SHIT IN THE WORLD?

Nobles.
I've got one to.

An e-mail anymore?
3a.

Hi, John.

Do you know how Owen Park is?

Must be a onemanshow?

I thought it best
to do everything

Come here, my friend.

Elvis is a retired police dog

Running out and play.

Are you okay? You seem tired.

Besides having obsessions and
be an alcoholic I'm fine.

You should get some help for
your alcohol problem.

The second might
be a good thing.

What you call obsessive, I call
fierce determination -

And it seems like good qualities
of a policeman.

My mother always said that there may come
something good out of the worst -

And it helps me to look
positively at things.

Well, now the case.

"What is your shit in the world?"
Say it do anything?

John ...

Committed a murder
a few days ago.

Calling The place looked
like your wife.

It is possible that the
same perpetrator.

I think there is
a serial killer.

For some reason he contacts you.

Why?
I do not know.

But we have reason to believe
that it will continue.

I say this only so you
are prepared for it.

I deliver your wife's mask for a

Whoever has done it
is very clever.

They are custom made from scratch.
They are amazing.

The artist is probably a man.

Artists use their thumbs to.

Strokes are quite large.
Large strokes, big
thumb and man.

Can you see if both masks are
made of the same person?

They are both custom made and
made of the same material.

They are also made
in the same style.

It looks like this.

Spivey. I come away.

It'll go mom. It'll go mom.

I'll fix it mom.

Sorry, Mom. I'll get better.

Now I have reviewed the tape and
there is definitely something.

Can you enlarge it?

It is a human.

Can you enlarge it?
Now pushing you lemon.

Was it intended that we
should see it here?

Or was it a mistake?

Mor ...

Do I have to come down now?

YOU ARE ALL TOGETHER SOME FISSER

Do you sleep well?
I've heard of it.

I could well try it.
Do you have any fire?

Amanda left the scene so 2O

It has some good notes.
Have you them from the boss?

Is this something we
should talk about?

Dreaming you saw anything
when you sleep?

Do you dream about your parents?

I once dreamed that my father
drove me to buy a gun.

Were there others in the car?
My son, I have not.

How old was your son
in the dream?

Maybe ten.
Maybe ten.

How old were you?
I could not see myself.

Bought your gun?
No, they did nothing more.

How did you feel about that?

It is obvious why I have
suicidal thoughts.

But since they have no
weapons, I am not.

We swap no place yet, but
it is good thinking.

Was your father in the shop?
That with my son was his idea.

Did you see him with?
No.

I think there was something remarkable,
when you were ten.

Have you any idea
what it could be?

Want to talk about the latest
victim and masks?

It excites you as always
up to talk about them.

What is it that bothers
you so much?

Why did your father not in?

What the hell happened to
you when you were ten?

The time is gone.

You look good, little man.

Listen, Russ.
Smile, no matter what
you see there.

Be happy when you see mom.
Okay, Dad.

I have both good and bad news.

We've got reply from the laboratory.
It is cotton.

The bad is that it
is almost total.

Spivey.
Your pen pal is back.

He is serious.
Can you trace it?

A bookstore in West Hollywood.

It has happened again.

The 'mask murderer has
turned on again -

And now believed he
also left behind

We can neither confirm
or deny snakes.

But we are very busy to see -

Between these two forbid-ons.

KriminaIinspektør Myers would
not jump to conclusions -

But we know the following: There are
two similarities between the crimes:

Masks and cut limbs.

He does not turn on the assassination.
Murder is not the goal.

Shut up, where is it scary.

Jacobs?

Check out his neck and
take a sample of it.

Richardson.

The sample you asked for?
Victim had.

Its own.

Says Shakespeare play "As You
Like It" you something?

I can not even spell
Shakespeare.

I'm good at figures, but the kind
I have never understood.

Why?
I'm just curious.

You still hang up posters?
Stop it.

The probability, that she
is alive, is so small ...

I continue as long
as it is likely.

I'll find him, John.

Do you know what it means when the
wind is blowing in the trees?

It is God who beckons.

You have a lot of nice trinket.

Many dislike nips, but I can.

What do I get for it?

Amanda left the scene
20 minutes before me.

Run.

I rang her mobile
but she did not.

I saw her car.
The door on the passenger
side was open.

Then I heard something.

I must have surprised
him, for he ran away.

He hit me.

Amanda rescued you say?

What is it about the masks
that bothers you?

"A faithful shepherd followed
your steps."

"Look at him, he worships you.
Teach him what is to love."

"To be nothing but tears,
as I have for Phoebe."

Spivey.
The mails are becoming
more and more strange.

"I flee from you in order not to harm you.
They say I am a murderer."

He's not going to kill you.

You are a tool.
He uses you to get
in touch with us.

Has one of you took
my earrings?

And so you would think
you can trust cops.

The material we found on the woman
was nonoxynol-9 on the lips.

It is a spermicidal
agent on condoms.

Hear it here from a
Shakespeare piece:

"You learn as long as you live.
Women can suffer a broken rib."

The first victim.
Yes. Broken ribs.

It is the last mail, Tyler has received.
Verbatim from the play.

He plays the piece?

Both Stringer murder
and murder is Tyler.

I do not remember
"As You Like It"

No, it's a comedy.
Why he refers to it?

Not only have we tried
what the accident.

Theaters have Fier tragedy than this
scene, which takes place on us.

The whole world is a stage.

All men and women are
merely actors.

Each have their replies.

And through his life plays
a man many roles.

Spivey?

Wait ... what?

Have no guards here?

We've never had problems before, mr.
Spivey.

Nightwatch is free tonight.

Are you saying that asshole can go in
and unseen dig such a hole here?

Apart from a few teenagers,
we have never had problmer.

Moreover, it would
also take one man

It's an interesting point.

It does not.
He got what he wanted.

I would certainly have
called first.

I thought that we could make peace.
To

I have taken with food.
It has shown you also need.

I think I've tried
it here before.

How is your apartment?
Okay.
Jeffrey helped with the move.

Lifting heavy things is shown
the only thing he can do.

Maybe you could help me
to hang up curtains.

You've kept mine.

They fit just as well do so.

How long will this continue?

Do you have a second, Russell?
Yes.

I have gay fantasies about
my psychologist.

I wonder just what
happened with us.

My forced leave
was probably his.

How is it when police officers
lose their service weapons.

We always runs in circles.
I justify it.

I just want to explain ...
Forget it.

You freaked, Russell.

You started to drink and
did not fit your work.

I know you had to witness.
What is it about?

I'm terrified ...
Dogs Fear of not ...

For not being able to help you.

You have always helped me.
Not the night in the woods.

Were you not here, he had
killed me, Russell.

I'm not just forgabt in you.

I love you really still.

And just so you know:
I have never.

And the one who calls
others to be honest -

Lets you good enough something
to be desired.

Do you want to talk about it?

Listen here: I have been told to go with you.
I do so.

The rest is up to you.

Do you have any fire?

No, I have not.
Want more coffee?

I would rather have fire.
You need more coffee.

Why you smashed the
mug, Russell?

Keep your eyes on the mug.
At one of the pieces.

Looking at it long enough,
collectors mug again.

Now you need to relax
and hear what I say.

Look at the stump. Do you hear?

Think back to your childhood
and keep on focusing.

You are ten years old.
What can you see?

My mom.
What is she doing?

She works in the garden.
She loves her roses.

Describe her.
She is beautiful.

She is the best mom on our way.

My father loves her.

She does say 
omething for him?

There was her thing.
Moget bad, is not he?

What can you see?

An accident.

Beware!

She struck her head.

She looks different.

You look good, little man.

Listen, Russ.
Smile, no matter what
you see there.

Be happy when you see mom.
Okay, Dad.

I'll wait here. Come.

Now you may well go to her.

Hi, Mom. You look really lovely.

Then she comes home.
Now she's come home.

Describe it.

She has changed.

She uses nasty words.
She is not the same anymore.

How is she to you?
She is a second.

She kisses me with the mask on.

I can feel the plastic on my face.
It is disgusting.

What happened to her?

She died.
How did she die?

Where is your father?
He started to drink.

Okay ...

Now I count to three and says:
"Awake." And then you wake up.

Then you can only remember
what you want.

One, two, three ... wake up.

Fire.

Okay ...

I have cleaned the image and made it lighter.
What says?

Stop the tape.

What is it?
Maybe a birthmark?

Play it one frame at a time.

It's too blurry.
Is the picture quality poor?

No, so there should be lines everywhere.
They are only on him.

What do you say?
There is no shadow.

Apart from design and
location, I think

Large scars.

The whole world is a stage.

All men and women are
merely actors.

Each have their replies.

And through his life plays
a man many roles.

Sorry to have to
get involved in.

Welcome back, Spivey.

I'm the king or queen and will
continue to play acting.

They have seen my work
before, Spivey.

They only get it here fora:

The last scene of all is a
new childhood oblivion.

Take care of yo
rselves, friends.

For the rest, Spivey ...
your mom is with me.

I would say hello.

What are you doing here?

I can not sleep.
What are you even here?

I could of course say, I just came
by, but I'm looking for you.

Me? What can I help?

Do I have to ...
You've studied psychology.

One of my friends ...
And it's so true.

He's not so good, and
I have it bad with.

I think in fact it is my
fault that he has such.

All right ...

So, guilt is emotion -

And it is only possible if you feel
something, so it is positive.

It sounds sensible enough.

I also feel something
else for him.

Guilt is like love and hate.

The opposite of love
is indifference.

It sounds fat, right?

I think at least not that
my friend does not care.

I am sure that your friend is happy
that you feel something for him.

I have no work.

Do not reject me.

Do you understand what
is happening?

Yes, I do.
He goes after me.

And are you close to me
can happen to you.

I can not ... protect you.

I would rather die than
to see you get hurt.

Let be.
Now, I think you
should come home.

Are you aware of how
much you mean?

There is a sheet on for your sake.
How delicious.

Was it expensive?
Wal-Mart best.

What is it?

That evening in the forest ...

Would you promise me one thing?

I never get to see you
look like this again.

I promise.

I love you.

They only get it here fora:

The last scene of all is a
new childhood oblivion.

Take care of yo
rselves, friends.

"The last scene of all is
a new childhood ..."

"Idre men meet death without teeth, sight,
taste, and without something."

Idre men. Amanda ..!

One of the perpetrators
are after me.

Is there more?
I think we are.

A white man in the 50s.
He looks ordinary looking
and is pedantic.

His hobby requires concentration.
He

He is a loner.

The second is also white.
He's big, strong and impulsive.

We think he damages himself.

He has scars on the
body, and I think.

His next victim is
an elderly man.

It is not random victims.
He knows them.

"A fool thinks he has some -

But a wise man knows he is an imbecile.
"

"When the pagan philosopher
felt the urge

He opened his mouth and came in your mouth ...
"

What did you really know me?

It is a hypnosis form that works

It is called the "confusion
technique".

Your dream was about your mother's
suicide not on yours.

You saw it as your father's fault.
I blamed him.

Forgive him.
He committed an error.
You have had feelings of guilt.

Over what?
That you were not in the car.

You feel that you betrayed your mother
because you do not rescued her.

It was too much for a decade.

So the feeling was there long
before you met Amanda.

You have been willing to failure
women throughout their lives.

It was not the mask,
you were afraid.

I saw you smash it here.
Granted. I've done it before.

I have a whole garage
full of them.

Spivey.

Our friend has shown huseret again
and presented a gift to us.

He comes here a couple times
a month and sits at the bar.

He did not even drink anything.
He looks just through his mask.

It's nothing. Here is also one.

Sorry.

But it frightens me.
It does not here.

I have lived in the
French quarters.

What is it?

Yes, he plays.
Make it just perfect.

It uses me as often.

Is this clean?
Hear ye?
Everything needs cleaning.

It was the same yesterday.

He came in and gave the guard
four 20-dollar banknotes.

I keep an eye on him.
He has damned.

He pays twice as much.
Why?

He cut in it, so we must
remove a mass of blood.

Is it not in the price here?
I do not think you are quite.

It is not the cuts, you
can put patches on.

He cut deep, as if he
was making sushi.

Long and deep wounds to hell.

Some to be sewed, otherwise
he would bleed to death.

But as I said, so it scares me.

It makes it that are on
the table, however.

Does he not know what it is?
It must himself see.

Then came with me to hell.

It's easy money.

And I know what I'm talking about because
I have been a Honda dealer.

Clean the boots, dammit.

There rolls the money into.
This is where filth is.

Bother at all to take a break?

"I surrender myself to
you, for I am yours."

Tell us about the mask.

There was just a mask.

Was it colored?
Yes.

We will have a word with
his chopper friends.

Shut up, which looks out here.
He is precise and insane.

What?
He is precise.

Temporal.
He'll never be half, or twenty
over a quarter past.

He is always 02/13.

It's damn crazy, right?

It was Rebecca last
birthday gift.

How has it been?
In the jewelry box.

Do you still?
In the dresser in the bedroom.

It seems like it always
ha'r done it?

Have you seen this before?

"Fall in love not in me.
I am more.

He has been in my home.
The lunatic has been here.

They have seen my work
before, Spivey.

They have seen my work
before, Spivey.

Hey, Elvis! Where's your daddy?

No coffee?
Have I missed your
coffee again?

Skip over coffee.
It tastes like piss.

I love orchids.

How sweet.
Bite me.

Your daddy loves
pee wife, right?

Let him work a little.
No, he is too old.

Let him try.

Find Jeffrey!

The russell Spivey from Los
Angeles police, Justine.

I am seeking information
on a mask, I

Have some papers on it?
From 1968 ...

Then I paper archive.

It is a police matter.
I'll see what I can do.

Thank you.

Spivey.

Holy shit!

I take it.

"Without teeth, eyesight
and without something."

I've found something, Russell.

"The world is a stage
and all the actors.

"Each have their lines -

And through his life plays a man many roles.
"

CHANGE sheet and save
it in the woods

There is something we do not see Jeffrey.
It's right in front of us.

The same age and
same neighborhood.

"You've seen my work before ..."
What?

I want to know about
these three persons.

Stringer was a nurse, Rothman
and Bragg were porters.

Were they at one time employed
at the same time?

The three of them recruited from
the mid 60s to late 60s.

Godfrey skgnhedsklinik.
It's Spivey, Justine.
Something new?

He has not worked
here for years.

What is his name?

Check a Carter Pullman, Jacob.

Check criminal records and
find his current address.

Nobles.
I've been bad.

Are you okay?
Will you tell Russell?

Carter's mother, Christine Pullman,
proportionate criminal record.

Do you know the name
Christine Pullman,

People in the neighborhood are
still talking about her.

We were often at home.
It was always her
son, who phoned.

Her husband often beat her
and abused her violently.

It was not illegal back then,
so she notified him never.

Eventually, she could hardly
cope with more.

D. February 13, 1958 she cut him
to pieces in the bathtub -

And buried him
in the basement.

All real estate agents
in town have.

What became of her?

She was found covered in blood.

She was incoherent and stared
when she was arrested.

What about the boy?
Carter?

It was the most 
istressing of all.

He was hung up in the basement.

The scars, he had testified
to regular abuse.

What happened to him?
Authorities were desperate.

Therefore he went to orphanages.

Then we heard from him ever.
He was a quiet boy.

Thanks for your help, Sedgewick.

Okay, thanks. No fixed address.

Kl. 2.13.
13th. February 19S8.

All real estate agents in town have
no heid tried to sell the house.

Give me your phone and
grab a group effort.

Lives there anyone in Pullman's
house, Sedgewick?

A gun!

It is mine.

Want to get someone to retrieve
my gun holster?

Who is that?
It's Christine Pullman.

Will you take care of it, Jacob?

Have you found something,
my friend?

What is this?
The basement, we
took Carter in.

I remember the larger than this.

Light here, boys.

We need a nail
scissors, Jamie.

My God!
It's Rebecca Tyler.

We need some ambulance people.

What is there now, dammit?

What is it?

What?

Jacobs ...

Make sure that she
will be helped.

Where is Amanda, Jeffrey?

Skip over coffee.
It tastes like piss.

She was taken home.

It's Amanda Richards.
Leave a message.

Listen carefully, Amanda.
Please get out of the house.

Shit!

I come, I come.
Hurry.

Which apartment is it?

Does the elevator here?
No, take the stairs.

Amanda?

Amanda, It's Jeffrey.

Amanda?

Have you found her, Jeffrey?

Adrian?

Come in, Adrian?
I listen.

Which apartment living
Amanda Richardson in?

Is she just moved in?
Damn, Adrian!

Look for a change of address.

What are you, Elvis?

Find Jeffrey, Elvis.

Adrian ...

I need help now!

I've seen this man's strength.

Pull in time out, by my honor and
my princely word, must die.

I am here to save.
I have no idea how devoted I am.

It's fools as you, that
fill this world -

With ugly children.

Have you got hold
of it, I asked?

Well done.
Bite me.

Russell .. .

I understand ...
not quite what going on here.

There is no one will
tell me something.

I have good news for you.
Your wife is alive.

It was what I said.

It's beautiful.
Fantastic. How is she?

She is weak, but she lives.

It's quite amazing.

Where am I happy.

When I visit her?
I have a photo of her.

Who has done it at her?
It's a little confusing.

According to her,
you have done it.

What do you think?

It's completely insane, Russell.

You know me.
You know since I never

So we try something else.

Do you know who this is?
No. I'm tired of it here.

Playing us for any game?
No.

I do not know who it is.
It is your mother.

Fine.
If you want to play the silly
game, so we make it -

But it is silly.

What did your mom like?
My mom ...

She was. ..

What color was her hair?

What about her eyes? You do.

It is running around in my head now ...
Can not remember your mother?

I can not ... think.

So let us take a few
easy questions in.

Wait, wait, wait ...
What was your teacher
in the fourth class?

Answer the questions
as they got more.

I do not understand it, John.
What was your father?

How long were you scout?
What was your first pet?

Have you forgotten everything?
Wait ...

It is here, I think
you can remember.

Can you remember when your wife,
Rebecca, were you unfaithful?

Your wife bollede with one another, because
you can not get it up and running

According to her, you have never been
able to get it up and running.

When she became pregnant, did you know
it was not yours, is not it, John?

She says you were one second.

Can you remember it, John?

It grew another man's child

What was it you wrote?

"What is your shit
in the world?"

"You are all some fisser."

The guide pussy deserved to die,
but John got frustrated that!

Fucking whore.

You look somewhat
bruised looking.

Do you want to beat me?

Who are you?

I am not a crook.

Do you have any fire?

You made my mother's
mask, right?

It is not all that
the eye can see.

Get cleaned the shriveled body
of this wicked world -

By patiently taking
my medication.

I could immediately see that you
took your world for granted.

Now you may well see her.

Occasionally there may come something
good out of the worst.

Hi, Mom.

You look really lovely.

You were blind.

It is not my mother.
Who is it?

Stop it. Do not do it there!

You just have to show respect.

I fear you have sold your
own land to see others.

Having seen so much and
nothing to hold ...

... To have rich eyes
and poor hands.

Where are you from?

You smashed the image
of your mother.

Why did you do that, Carter?

Why you smashed the
picture, Carter?

You smashed it, but look at it.

Can you see the pieces?
They accumulate.

Listen carefully to
what I say, Carter.

We two must be on a little trip
back to when you were ten.

Can you see anything?

Your mother is unhappy.

Your father is sleeping.
He treats her badly, right?

I can not get to finish.

I can not reach it. Sorry.

You saw it, right?

Carter!

I did not have to be done.
It was not perfect.

Pit the sheets down.
I have to save the sheets.

Save the sheets ...

Mor ... what are you doing?

You must clean the walls.
They must be absolutely clean.
Understood?

Clean them!

It can not go on, mother.

It may not go away.

I'll do my best.

Russell ...

Will not you help me?

No, I will not be there.

Do not make me hurt.

Sorry, I'll get better.

It does not help.

You are not useful.

I surrender myself to
you, for I am yours.

I surrender myself to
you, for I am yours.

I surrender myself to
you, for I am yours.

I surrender myself to you ...

Carter ...

When I have spoken to
three, wakes you.

A ...

... Two ...

... Three.

Do you think you've caught me?

I am here because I
want to be here.

I have done so for your sake.

You have killed a nurse, two porters
and destroyed your wife.

The pussy is not my wife!

May I see it?

It's creepy.

Could you not have made
it more feminine?

I will not be judged!

I knew it would end like this.
To

Are you ready?

My mother committed suicide
when I was ten.

Two years later my father
died of drowning.

Since I was the 12th Do you really
think you can intimidate me?

Yes.

Are you all right?
Yes, I'm just tired.

But it is nice that he
has returned, right?

I overheard that you dropped your kussehul,
although she would help.

You have always been a spoiled
shit adolescents.

But are not you more.

A fool thinks he has some -

But a wise man knows
he is an imbecile.

You love mazes.

Then learn this of me:
To have is to have.

Leaning is something from
a cup into a glass -

Timber is something and
fill something else.

So, you, you fool -

Leave the community
with this woman.

I kill you.
I'm treating you with poison.

I kill you in 150
different ways.

I know.

Amanda? Amanda!

You will not live here.

Occasionally there may come something
good out of the worst.

You were actually blind

Do you understand me now?

Therefore, you shake and flee.

Now I say goodbye.

You pigeons ...

... To nothing ...

... In my eyes.

Blessed are the dead who
now lie with the Lord.

They are rested after their work,
for their deeds follow them.

Support us, Lord, when the
day coming to an end.

We ask you, Lord, to accept
two of your children.

We give you Gretchen
Spivey back -

And ask you also to find
room for Amanda Richards.

Have mercy, Lord, for
I am powerless.

Health me, sir, because
my body is afflicted.

Come back, sir, and
rode my life.

Give me your steadfast love.

The best of me come with you.
