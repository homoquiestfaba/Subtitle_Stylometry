I'd say they've been dead
since this morning.

I'll check with Rachel,
but I-I think they were alive
when they were, er...

I've never seen anything like this.

And they've been joined in
the thighs, in the groin.

Looks like they're kissing.
They've been...hooked through the
throat to each other.

Meat hooks.

Well, the killers reversed the van
back here onto the bridge.

Opened the doors.

Chain them to the railing,
dump them over the side.

Then parked their van
back down in the car park.

Their signature's in the van.

Paula Scott. Tamsin Green.

Were they lovers?

Is that why they're...?

What's that?

It's got a gem missing.

But it's definitely a man's ring.

Why leave it here? Unless
that leads to our next victim?

The van was moved.

Did anyone see the driver?

Put out an appeal.

Television, local radio.

Newspapers.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

You OK? Yeah, of course.

It's just...

You'll get used to it.
I'm not sure you're supposed to.

Stephanie Baker?

Everyone calls me Steph.

I'm afraid we've got some bad news.

Stephanie... Steph...

I'm afraid
there's no easy way to say this.

Your partner,
Paula Scott's been murdered.

Stephanie?

How long have you lived with Paula?

I'm sorry, but I haven't got time for this. This is all...
When was the last time you saw Paula?

Four days ago. Your
partner's been missing for four days,
and you never reported her missing?

I didn't report her missing
because she wasn't missing.

Paula's a travel rep. They travel.

We can do this at the station.
She was supposed to be in Scotland.

She was supposed to be at a
conference. Am I supposed to presume
she's a liar? Is that all?

I've got work to do.

Yeah, don't let your partner
being killed ruin your day.

There's no way to tell
the exact time of death, due to the
conditions the bodies were found in.

But the blood spurts in the van and
round the wounds indicate they were
alive when they were hooked together.

Different deaths.

Different backgrounds.

So the only thing they have in
common is the signature, "Save me".

So we know it's the same killer.
And all the victims are women.

So far. What about the ring?

All they could tell us was
that it might be foreign.

And we're going through missing
persons files for the last month,

looking for descriptions
of personal items.

They were alive

when they were hooked together. Are
Paula and Tamsin being punished
because they were unfaithful?

Is that what these murders
are about? Is it punishment?

Vickie, get on to forensics.

Get them to lay out everything
bagged from Catherine McArdle's
flat. All of it?

Yes! All of it!

Too close to home? You knew Paula
was having an affair.
Where were you last night, Steph?

There was no conference
in Scotland, was there?

Steph. There's no shame in
admitting she was having an affair.

You found Paula with
Tamsin, didn't you?

I wish to God I had. Maybe if I'd
found them, I wouldn't
have... And what? You killed them?

I wouldn't have lost her for good.

It'd be different if
it was the first time Paula had...

Do you know what it's like
to watch somebody disappear
in front of your eyes?

Seven years together and she...

Are you done here?

Steph.

What?

I bought them in a shop.

Does this look the sort of
thing Catherine would wear?

Hand-painted silk.

"New Life Designs".

Artist's workshop in the East End.

Expensive.

Smarter.

Angry woman in the expensive coat.

'Your credit card
receipt was found amongst...
Your credit card receipt...

'Mrs White, your credit card receipt'
was found among some stolen credit cards.

Can you confirm a purchase with
New Life designers?

Eccleshall.

The Eccleshall receipt.

Where's the Eccleshall receipt?

What was her first name?
Grace. She wasn't in.

I'm trying to tell her.
Grace. Just hang on.

Grace Eccleshall.

We have a problem.

The scarf we found in Catherine's
room belongs to a Grace Eccleshall.

How's that a problem?
She's Richard Eccleshall's wife.

Richard Eccleshall
was also Isabel Price's tutor.

What, you think he killed her?

If he was Catherine's boyfriend,
he could be the father of her baby.

So there may be a link
between Catherine and Isabel.

But Isabel wasn't murdered.

But if Isabel's tutor
IS the murderer,

I don't want Rachel
to hear about this.

Lose something?

So you went around to Catherine's
flat to what? Compare notes?

I went around and told her
that I knew. Knew what?

She wasn't his first and she
needn't make plans to be his last.

So how often does this happen?
Once a year.

Twice? That's our business.
Not when your scarf turns up in
the flat of a murder victim.

He wasn't going to leave me for her.

So you admit that you threatened her?

I asked her to back off.
She wouldn't listen, we argued and I
left. What did you argue about?

About her hassling Richard.

Look, it was over in
about fifteen minutes.

That was the last time I saw her.

Now I've told you everything I know.

Sit down, Grace.

You went in his place and
did his dirty work for him.

How dare you?! Did you wait and
follow Catherine

after she left her room? She wanted
to take him away from me.

You don't just give up
on someone you love.
You fight for them.

Would you kill for them?
Oh, for God's sake.

Did you wait and follow Catherine
after she left her room?

Did you call her?

I went to work, I gave a lecture
and then I spoke to Richard.
Did your husband call her?

She was pestering him.
Why would he call her?

Where did you go after Catherine's?

I went to a lecture. Then I came
back here, collected some clothes
and I went to stay with my sister.

You were angry with him? Yes.
You wanted to teach him a lesson.

I wanted some space.

Now I've told you everything I know.

When did you get back? This
afternoon. Your sister will confirm

you've been staying with her for the
past three days?

I've told you everything I know.

Now I'd like you to leave, please.
Did Catherine tell
you she was pregnant?

There's no proof it was his.

Did you tell Richard?

She didn't love him.

I do.

So the intellectual structure
is in place by the third section.

And where Paradise
offers us salvation and reward...

Salvation and...
..reward for those who...
believe.

What is, er... What is going on?

Richard Eccleshall, I am arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

We know you were sleeping
with Catherine McArdle.

We know Catherine wanted
you to leave Grace for her.

Yes, but...
We know you wanted to get rid of
Catherine but she wouldn't listen.

It was fine.

You call this "fine"?
Did you and Grace kill her together?

Was that part of the
arrangement as well?

We want to do a DNA test, Richard.

What for?
You're the lecturer, work it out.

Catherine was pregnant.
-No.

No, she... She couldn't have been.

The baby died when she died.

She would've told me. You don't
see women as people, do you? You
just see them as objects

to be picked up and tossed aside at
the end of the year.

Where were you in the early hours of
Monday morning? I was at home.

While Grace was at her sister's?

I-I've never seen that
woman before in my life.

Really?!

She used to work at the college.

Your college.
Where were you on Tuesday night?

I was at home.
While Grace was at her sister's?

Where were you
the night before last?

At home.
While Grace was at her sister's?

I've never seen them before.

Who does this belong to?

I want my lawyer. Who does
the ring belong to, Richard?

(I've traced the ring.)

I've matched the description of
the ring to a recent missing
person's report.

John Giardello. 46. Italian
restaurant owner, North London.

He's been missing for six days.
His wife Emma made the report.

Get a photo and description
circulated. We have to find him.

I think he's found you.

..Can we trace this?

Do it.

Please help me.

Help me, please.

How long has he got? ..He's in pain.

If he's got no water...

a few days.

Metal walls. The van.
The hold of a ship.

What about Computer Forensics?
In geek heaven.

They're going through the
killer's message frame by frame.

Giardello drove to the bank with the
restaurant takings.

The money was never lodged. His car
is missing. Six days.

He could be dead already.
If so, why send an e-mail?

This wasn't just left at the scene.
This was sent directly to me.

Your e-mail address is on the LMP
web page.

It was sent via a chain of
re-mailers - Thailand, Turkey,
Russia.

Can it be traced?

Re-mailers scrub the computer's IP
address to ensure complete anonymity.

Where is he? Who?

John Giardello. I'm giving you
one chance to help us save him.

I've never seen him before in
my life. This is your evidence?!
Come on, we're going.

DCI Metcalfe! He's still alive.
And while he's alive,

that counts in your favour.
Hang on. You've just received these.

My client was in custody.
They were sent by a re-mailer.

They're given specific instructions
where and when to send their e-mails.

And you've got evidence?
Search his computer. How long
are you going to hold my client?

As long as it takes.

There's a needle-puncture mark
to the arm.
PHONE RINGS

Hello? ..Red.

Yeah, I'll get Rachel for you...
Oh.

Oh. ..OK.

In an hour.

What did he want?
He didn't say.

I've tried to keep busy, but I'm
so tired, always fearing the worst.

Well, sometimes it's, um...it's hard
not to fear the worst.

Your husband drove to the
bank on Saturday?

Mm-hm. John does the night lodgement.

The week's takings were just
over Â£3,000.

Last time I saw him.

Put your heart and soul in a place.
Break your back night and day.
Non mangiare questo.

Non mangiare quello.

English, speak English.

Do you recognise this man,
Mrs Giardello?

A customer maybe?

A friend of your husband's?

No. I don't think so.

I mean, if he's only eaten
here once or twice... Mum?

Oh, it's OK, Franco.
They're looking for your father.

See, I told you. It's going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.

I expect you do your
accounts on computer.

We need to take them with us.
It's just routine.

Do you know your dad's password?

Well, I set it up for him, didn't I?

His computer's upstairs.

Giovanni is dead, isn't he?

Isn't he? Stop talking like that.
She always sees the worst.

No, I know what I
want to be true, but...

That's a nice photograph. Who's he?

That's my Uncle Rico.
I give birth to Giovanni.

Black sheep of the family.
MRS GIARDELLO: His name is John.

Family's important
at times like these.

Senora Giardello...
..non e d'aiuto alla sua famiglia.

Your dad never mentioned
he was being followed?

Never felt like he was being watched?

Look.
He walked out on us, all right?

That's what happened. One minute
he was here, the next he...

Look, you know what?

Just good riddance.

When you reported your husband
missing, you mentioned a ring.

Mmm. Yeah.

I bought John a diamond-studded ring
on our honeymoon.

He lost a gem on the
right side last year.

I said to John, "We bought it when
we were broke and we'll fix it
when we're broke." Yes.

No. You stay here.

You don't have to do this.

Best seat in the house.

We need you to confirm
that this is your husband.

Anything.

Anything at all that you can see

that can help us to find him.

MRS GIARDELLO: Oh, God.

Shall we get you a cup of tea,
coffee?

Come on, let's go
in the family room.

Mamma!

I'm sorry.

We've put a pipe in your system.

It lets us monitor everything
coming and coming into your account.

You've no shameful surfing
to hide, DCI Metcalfe, do you?!

Anyway, the e-mail you received is a
video file. It's like any other
computer file.

As soon as it's saved onto a
hard drive, it stores information.

This one was created two days ago.

Anything else? Plenty.

It was filmed using a
domestic digital camera.

Fairly standard resolution.

The video's been compressed
using a Sorenson Codec.

Anything useful?

The walls might be stainless steel.

Curved.

Police stations make me nervous.

I want you to do a DNA test
on a suspect. OK.

But why me and not Rachel?
The suspect is known to Rachel.

He may be the father of
Catherine McArdle's child.

Richard Eccleshall.

He was Isabel's tutor at college.

He spoke at her inquest.

You're asking me to lie to Rachel?

Will this hurt?

It's a painless procedure.

Sir.

You won't feel a thing.

Giardello's and Eccleshall's
computers are clean.

And Eccleshall is being bailed.

Circumstantial evidence, hearsay,
this is not a fascist state. Blah,
blah, blah. The usual.

We can hang onto him for withholding
evidence.

Let him go. I can get him to
talk by the end of the day.

We haven't got enough to charge him.

Put him under surveillance.
Discreetly.

Check his wife's computer as well.

McArdle, Fullerton, Greene, Scott.

The list ends here.

We find John and we save him.

You screwed up, didn't you?

I was right. Isabel WAS murdered.
That's why Richard
Eccleshall was here.

For the last time, Jack...

Red thinks he killed Isabel and
Catherine. Doesn't he? Do you mind?

Did you hear what I said? I did. But
I'm trying to pretend that I didn't.

I'm talking to you. No,
you're talking AT me, Jack.
Learn the difference.

You screwed up. I was right.

Izzy's case is linked to Red's case.

Everything all right? Yeah.

It's fine.

You asleep?! Take them, take them.

DCI Metcalfe. There's another one.

I wouldn't give him 12 hours.
The first file was 170 megs.
This one is double that.

Definitely three bleeds.
Can you filter it?

It's a plane. He's near an airport.
Ssh, quiet. It's close.

Under a flight path.

It's a turbo prop. An ATP. STOL.

City Airport.

STOL? Short takeoff and landing.

Sounds like a train.

It's not a mainline, it's lighter.
A tube? No, it sounds...

DLR. Docklands Light Railway.
It's near the City Airport.

That's a tube. District line.

It runs above ground at Bromley by
Bow and crosses the DLR.

Air traffic approach routes.
Train lines.

We need somewhere out the way.
Isolated.

An industrial estate.
No, too many people.

There's a bonded warehouse here.
Security and staff.

There's too many people in there.

What about the gasworks? No. The
only one in the area was demolished.

Disused brewery?

Stainless steel walls. Vats.

Hang on.

There's something else.

Red! ..It's his car.

There's a hypo,
and what looks like the money.

We've got... I don't know.
We've got something.

Clear!

John Giardello! John Giardello!

John Giardello!

Where was that? Who was that?

There's no rigor.

It passes after 36 hours.

He was dead already.

I sat in that room, I watched him
suffer and he was dead already.Why?

VICKIE: He was dead before the clips
were even sent to you.

RACHEL: No-one blames you.

No-one has to.

Red?

What is it?

Per me si van e la citta dolente.

Ne la citta dolente.

I am the way to the city of weeping.

I am the way to eternal grief.

I am the way to the people lost.

Abandon every hope,
all ye who enter.

Dante.

Catherine McArdle. Stung by bees.

Claire Fullerton. Released from limbo.

Tamsin Green and Paula Scott.

The lovers. Lustful.

Gluttony.

We're in Dante's Inferno.

The killer is condemning
his victims to hell.

Toxicology, I need blood and urine
samples, please.

Can you get the viscera bag and bowls
ready?

Tim, do we have those
20ml syringes?

The 50ml are going to
be too big for this one.

I hear your voice every day.

I want him to be alive
but I can't make him alive.

The lacerations match
those in the other deaths.

The scabs and clotting on his
wounds suggest they healed two,
three days ago.

Apart from this obviously
self-inflicted wound. Thank you.

Thank you for breaking your
lecture, Professor Robb.

I'm not sure my head of department
classifies talking to a room full of
mostly empty chairs as a lecture.

I'm also
not quite sure what I can do.

Professor Robb,
thank you for coming.

Dried flakes of blood in the mouth.

Minor healed lacerations in
the throat and the oesophagus.
What's his stomach contents?

Partial lumps of masticated
flesh, vein, small chips of
bone in the digestive tract.

I suppose could account for
lacerations in the throat. Larvae. Mud?

Oh, Christ.

Oh, that's excrement.

All right.
Let's send his bone chips off and
find out if they match the radius.

I've heard that sometimes
mountaineers can cut through their
arm with a saw blade or penknife.

Perhaps he tried to gnaw
his hand off.
How long would it take him to die?

He was dying
of dehydration when he...

The larvae in his stomach mean
a forensic entomologist can give us
an exact time of death. Tim?

I'll have the samples packed up
as soon as we're done.

He was dead long before we got there.

He was dead.

We saw him suffering
after he was dead.

He was in hell. I can't do this.
You've got the wrong woman.
I'm sorry.

There is no-one else.
There must be. I'm not the only
Dante expert in London.

Please find somebody else.
But Professor Robb, if we...

I interrupted my lecture.
Would somebody tell me
what the hell is going on?

We've found something in his stomach.

Here we go again.

OK, attention please, everybody.

Thank you.

Professor Robb. ..Ah.

Not quite sure where to start.
Well, from the beginning.

Right, so, um...

Dante was an Italian,

writing in the fourteenth century.

Um, he...

Well, the Inferno is the first
part of the Divine Comedy.

Um, Dante conceived the
Inferno as this enormous pit. Ah.

Could you put it down there?

Lovely.

Thank you very much. Right.

See, he imagined it as this huge pit
and he begins his journey

outside the Inferno
at the Vestibule,
which is the entrance to hell.

The Inferno has nine circles
spiralling down to the bottom

and each circle that Dante travels
through represents a different sin.

Like lust or violence.

And as he passes from the Vestibule
down to the darkest, lowest
pit of hell,

inflicted
on the souls in each circle.

The Vestibule.

The entrance to hell.

Punishment of the indecisive.

People who were indecisive in life
were made to follow a blank banner
in death.

For Dante they were, um...

They were "souls who lived a life
with no blame and with no praise,

"neither faithful nor
unfaithful to their God."

Please.

Catherine McArdle.

Dropped out of college.

Couldn't hold down a job.

The punishment?
"Stung again and again by the hornets

"and the wasps that circled them
and made their faces run with blood.

"Their blood, mixed with their
tears, dripped to their feet.

"And disgusting maggots
collected in their pus".

The entrance to hell was
supposed to be at Gehenna.

And Gehenna was this
garbage dump outside Jerusalem.

Indecisive in life.

Stung into action in death.

Circle one.

The unbaptised, or Limbo.

Claire Fullerton.
Her life had been on hold
since the death of her daughter.

Ten years later she was still
visiting the spot every week.

"For this defect and no
other guilt, we are lost.

"In this alone we suffer.

"Cut off from hope,
we live on in desire."

She was in Limbo.
The hospice was a
metaphor for her life.

She suffered.

She was in grief. Untormented grief.

Circle two.

Lust.

"I came to a place
where no light shone.

"The infernal storm sweeps and
drives the spirits in its blast...

"tossed and whirled by winds,
lashing them with punishment."

Now this circle is a perfect example
of Dante's use of contrapasso.

Um, your punishment in hell
mirrors - or is the opposite of -
your sin.

What I was once in life,
I now am dead.

The violent shed blood in life,
their punishment is to lie in
a river of blood in death.

The adulterous lovers,
divided in life,

now become the doomed souls
eternally united in hell.

Your sin is used
and turned against you.

I thought this was
supposed to be a comedy.

Tamsin Greene, Paula Scott.

"If you use your body
as an animal in life...

"I will treat you as an animal
in death."

John Giardello.
Circle three. Gluttony.

The sinners in this circle are
forced to gorge on mud
and excrement,

instead of the wine and the
food they dined on in life.

The killer has taken us to circle three.
There are six circles to go.

Six murders,
or sets of murders, to go.

What about the next circles?

Circle four
is the spendthrifts and hoarders.

Circle five, the violent
lying in a river of blood.

Circle seven, violence
against property, self and God.

Circle eight is, um, fraud.

And circle nine...

Circle nine is
the lowest pit of hell.

The worst sin of all.

Treachery.

OK, OK. Um...

Hoarders and spendthrifts?

Well, um, the sinners that Dante
witnessed being punished in this
level of hell were mostly priests.

Roman Catholic priests.

It must be a priest.
Well, there must be something else
in Dante to narrow this down.

Have you got some
good news for me?

I thought that was
your job, Father.
How long is it this time?

We have to head off early again,
Father.

The lost souls
were forced to ram enormous rocks
into one another's chests.

I'm sorry, Dante thought that all
priests were sinners. Corrupt.

"Their undistinguished life
that made them foul made it hard
to distinguish them now."

Do you know how many
priests there are in London?
I think we're about to.

We can't protect them all.

Red.
We can't protect them all.

We protect them all.

I'm in position.

What's been happening?
He hasn't left the
building all morning.

Grace went out about an hour ago.

Grace is back.

You killed my daughter.

Get off!

He's killing him! He's killing him!

Help him!

Say it!

Say it.
Or so help me, I will kill you.

He killed her! He killed her!

Jack! Jack! Get up!

Where's Eccleshall?

You've got five minutes, Jack.

All right?

Eccleshall killed Izzy, Rachel.

Jack. Listen to me, Rachel.

He killed her.

He's her tutor...
Well, WAS her tutor.

It doesn't
matter if you try and kill him,
she isn't coming back. She's dead.

So why's Red had him in as a
suspect? Why's Red had a DNA
test carried out on him?

No.

No, Red wouldn't. Hasn't he told you?

No, I didn't think so.

His first victim was Izzy.

He started with her.

Then he moved on to McArdle,
Fullerton.

..Red wouldn't keep it from you
unless he thought
there was something in it.

Thanks for coming in.

Charge me or release me.

Where's your husband, Grace?
I said charge me or release me.

You must really love him.

I can't see any other reason why you
would do all this. Do all what?

So long as Richard comes back,

you'll put up with his affairs.

You'll wait for him.

Believe his lies

when he comes back late from a
tutorial.

Assuming that
the till death us do part is...

is not a lie. It's not.

And I do.
I do love him.

You can't choose the bits of a
person to love and forget the rest.

You either love them or you don't.

And if you love them,
you'll do anything for them.

Including believe his lies?

Most couples I know measure
their marriage by something.

Years together, income, their kids,
what they have,
what they haven't got.

A lie

is as good a foundation as a truth.

And what about them?

The girls.

The Catherine McArdles
of this world...

..and all those lies?

I'm still here.

Catherine isn't.

That sounds like a confession.
It's an observation.

The difference between them and me

is that they try to change him.

I accept him for what he is.

And maybe some day he will change.

It won't be because I made him.

There are two kinds of lies, Grace.

The one that you get away with.

And the one you get caught in.

Which was Richard's last lie?

The one that you caught him with?

Or where he was when
Catherine McArdle was murdered?

Charge me, or release me.

Grace, my arse. Have you ever met
a more inappropriately named woman?

I think we're looking
at the wrong Eccleshall. What are
you going to do about Jack?

Richard Eccleshall is the father
of Catherine McArdle's child.

Glad I can be the
bearer of such good news.

Rachel. Um...

I know that...

Izzy killed herself.

I am not Jack.

Next time,
do me the professional courtesy,
and don't go behind my back.

I'm sorry.

So am I.

You're being bailed.

Under the terms of your bail,
you're suspended from duty.

You are not to go anywhere near
Richard Eccleshall. Is that clear?

Why?
You're not the forgiving type, Red.

We all make mistakes.

Why is it so important to you to
believe that Eccleshall did it?

You wouldn't understand.

The last time you spoke to Izzy...

..what happened?

Nothing. Nothing special.

Can I help you?

738.

Sorry?
The answer to Duncan's question.

There are 738 Catholic
priests in London.

They've been warned
and offered protection.

The rest are being tracked down
or spoken to as we speak.

But?

There was a priest who
was still on the list.

He left the priesthood last year.

Decided it wasn't for him.

Defrocked priests?

They're the real
sinners, aren't they?

I mean, we could narrow it down.

No, no. No.
No, don't narrow it down.

Some of these priests were kicked out
the Church, others seem to have left
voluntarily.

Those are the details we have
of everyone who's ever
passed through our doors.

I'm not sure how reliable
the addresses are now.

No, this is a big help, Father.
It's just Simon now. Simon Emerson.

I suggest you restrict
your movements. Travel in pairs
with someone you trust.

Anything unusual or suspicious,
contact us, no matter
how trivial it might seem.

I'm surprised you managed to get
anything out of Monsignor Noonan.

He normally refuses
to acknowledge we even exist.

The Church hopes by forgetting us,
the rest of the world will forget
we were ever part of the Church.

How did these men become...
..casualties?

Various reasons.

They battle their
own individual demons.

They pay for their sins in
this life, and will continue
to pay for them in the next.

Do any of your residents
have trouble with money?

Take a look around you.

Giving up a lifetime's
vocation can be hard.

It's hard to keep these men
from falling even further.

This refuge is all there is
between them and the streets.

Some people think they're lost
and not worth saving. I disagree.

Doesn't it bother you...

being abandoned by the Church?

Sometimes the Church doesn't
have all the solutions.

You have to look elsewhere
for the answer.

Duncan. We need a car down at
Farrick Road.

There are 20 ex-priests here
all with a reason to be angry.

And can you pull the
files on any of these names?

Run a check on Simon Emerson.

Simon Emerson.

Thomas Brown. Joseph Sweeney.

Patrick Murphy...

The souls that Dante witnessed
being punished at this level of hell
were mostly priests.

Roman Catholic priests.

Red.

When Emerson was a parish priest,
he killed a teacher who'd been
abusing a ten-year-old girl.

The teacher confessed
the abuse to Emerson several times
and refused to seek help.

So Emerson took matters
into his own hands?

He handed himself in to the police.
He confessed, pleaded guilty. He even
refused a solicitor at the trial.

The anger of a righteous man.

Where was he parish priest?

Saint Peter's.

Oh, oh, oh.

His chest is...

Red?

You OK?

Dad? Dad? It's Izzy.

I need you to help me.

Please, Dad.

Answer me, Dad.

Please, Daddy?

Daddy.
