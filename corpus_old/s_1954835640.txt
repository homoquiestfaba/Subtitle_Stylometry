Okay, okay. Here we go.

So lonely.

Stiff.

I can't do that!

Come on, Elsa, this is for Anna.
You can do this.

Relax! It looks great.

I just want it to be perfect.

Speaking of perfect, check this out.

Kristoff, are you sure I can
leave you in charge here?

Absolutely.

Because I don't want anything
to happen to this courtyard.

What could happen? It's all set.

Olaf, what are you doing?

I'm not eating cake.

Olaf...
But it's an ice cream cake!

And it's for Anna.
And it's for Anna.

Oh, it's time!
It's time! For what?

Okay...

You sure you got this?
I'm sure.

Don't let anyone in before we're ready.
I won't.

And don't touch anything.
I'm just gonna stand here.

I'm probably gonna walk around a little.
And keep an eye on that cake!

She thinks you're an idiot!

Well, clearly she's wrong!

What? It's fine.
I can't read... or spell.

Anna!
Yeah?

Happy birthday.

To you.

It's your birthday!

To me...

It's my birthday.
Come on!

It's my birthday?
And it's going to be perfect because...

<i>You've never had a real birthday before</i>

<i>Except, of course, the ones
just spent outside my locked door</i>

<i>So I'm here way too late
to help you celebrate.</i>

<i>And be your birthday date if I may...</i>

<i>Elsa, I'm thinking you might have a cold</i>

I don't get colds, besides...

<i>A cold never bothered me anyway</i>

Fancy.
Just follow the string.

Wait, what?

<i>I've got big plans,
I've got surprises for today</i>

<i>Nothing but nothing's
gonna get in our way</i>

<i>I've worked for weeks
planned everything within my power</i>

<i>I even got Kristoff and Sven
to take shower</i>

<i>If someone wants to hold me back</i>

<i>I'd like to see them try</i>
Summer!

<i>I'm on the birthday plan attack</i>

<i>I'm giving you the sun,
the moon and the sky</i>

Little brothers!

<i>I'm making today a perfect day for you</i>
Sandwich!

<i>I'm making today a blast
if it's the last thing I do</i>

<i>For everything you are to me
and all you've been through</i>

<i>I'm making today a perfect day for you</i>

They come in threes!
I'm fine.

<i>Surprise, surprise this one specially...</i>

<i>You've got me reeling
but I'm still concerned for you</i>

<i>I think it's time that you go home
and get some rest</i>

<i>We are not stopping
'cause the next one is the best</i>

<i>Elsa, you gotta go lie down</i>

<i>No way, we have to paint the town</i>

<i>But you need medical attention</i>

<i>Are you sick? How 'bout a cold remedy
of my own invention</i>

No thanks.
We'll take it.

<i>We're making today a perfect day for you</i>
<i>Making today a special day</i>

<i>We're singing a birthday song
to make your wishes come true</i>

<i>Wishes come true</i>
<i>We love princess Anna</i>

<i>And I love you too</i>

<i>So we're making today a perfect day
A fabulous day in every way</i>

<i>We're making today a perfect day</i>

I can fix it.

No, no!

All fixed!

"Dry banana hippy hat"?

Come on. Now we climb!

Elsa, that's too much. You need to rest.

We need to get to our birthday chills,
I mean thrills.

<i>Making dreams, making plans</i>

<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

<i>Follow the string to the end
You are my very best friend</i>

Elsa?
What? I'm fine.

<i>We're gonna climb, we're gonna sing</i>

<i>Follow the string to the thing</i>

<i>Happy, happy, happy
Merry, merry, merry</i>

<i>Hot... cold... hot... big day</i>

Elsa, look at you. You've got a fever.
You're burning up.

<i>Alright, we can't go on like this</i>

<i>Let's put this day on hold</i>

<i>Come on, admit it to yourself</i>

<i>Okay</i>

<i>I have a cold</i>

I'm sorry, Anna. I just wanted
to give you one perfect birthday,

but I ruined it. Again.

You didn't ruin anything.
Let's just get you to bed.

Surprise!

<i>We're making today a perfect day for you</i>

<i>We're making today a smiley face
all shiny and new</i>

<i>There's a fine line between chaos
And a hullabaloo</i>

<i>We're making today a perfect day
Making today a perfect day</i>

<i>A! N! N! A!</i>

<i>Making today a perfect day for you</i>
Happy birthday.

<i>Making today a happy day and no feeling blue</i>
I love you baby!

<i>For everything you are to us</i>

<i>And all that you do</i>
I do.

<i>We're making today a perfect day
Making today a perfect day</i>

<i>Making today a perfect day</i>

Perfect day!
Okay. To bed with you.

Wait, wait. All that's left to do is for
the queen to blow the birthday bugle horn.

No, no, no, no, no...

Best birthday present ever.
Which one?

You letting me take care of you.

This way, Sludge and Slush and Slide
and Ansel and Flake and Fridge

and Flurry and Powder and Crystal
and Squall and Pack and Sphere

and William!
Don't ask.
