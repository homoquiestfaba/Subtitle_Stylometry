GIRL: <i>The number one rule
in my family?</i>

<i>Honor your parents.</i>

<i>They're the supreme beings
who gave you life</i>

<i>who sweated
and sacrificed so much</i>

<i>to put a roof
over your head,</i>

<i>food on your plate,</i>

<i>an epic amount of food.</i>

<i>The least you can do
in return is</i>

<i>every single thing
they ask.</i>

<i>'Course some people are like,
"Be careful.</i>

<i>"Honoring your parents
sounds great,</i>

<i>"but if you take it too far,</i>

<i>"well, you might forget
to honor yourself."</i>

Luckily,
I don't have that problem.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

I'm Meilin Lee.

And ever since I turned 13,
I've been doing my own thing.

Making my own moves,
24/7, 365.

I wear what I want,
say what I want

and I will not
hesitate to do

a spontaneous cartwheel
if I feel so moved. (GRUNTS)

(MAN GASPS)
Oh, crap!

Not to brag,

but being 13 means
I'm officially a grown-up.

At least according to the
Toronto Transit Commission.

Good for you.

MEILIN: Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

All about that hustle,
am I right?

(UPBEAT MUSIC CONTINUES)


Besties, assemble!

Miriam!
Hmm?

Hey!

(BOTH LAUGHING, WHOOPING)

<i>I know, it's a lot...</i>

(PLAYING NOTE)

But this is grade eight.

I don't got time
to mess around.

I guess you could call me...

A very enterprising,
mildly annoying young lady.

A major weirdo.

An overachieving dork-narc.

(MEILIN GRUNTS)

I accept
and embrace all labels.


Oops.
Hey!

Aah!
Oh, you're dead!

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
MEILIN: Coming through!

Mmm-hmm!

(DREAMY MUSIC PLAYING)

My mom cuts his hair
at the salon,

and I felt it. It's very soft.

Whoa. Can I have some?

Yeah, Abby, hook a sister up.

Can't you just

But I like cleaning.

I got this new feather duster

Our family runs
one of the oldest temples

And the most unique.

Instead of honoring a god,
we honor our ancestors.

And not just the dudes either.

Our most revered ancestor,
Sun Yee,

was a scholar, poet,

She dedicated her life to
the creatures of the forest.

Especially the red panda.

Ta-da!
TOURISTS: Ooh!

Which she loved

(DOOR OPENS)

(WIND BLOWING)

(MYSTICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

our ancestor, Sun Yee,

had a mystical connection
with red pandas.

In fact,
she loved them so much

that she asked the gods
to turn her into one.

(DRAMATIC TRADITIONAL MUSIC
PLAYING)

<i>It was wartime.
The men were all gone.</i>

<i>Sun Yee
was desperate for a way</i>

<i>to protect herself
and her daughters.</i>

<i>Then one night,
during a red moon,</i>

<i>the gods granted her wish.</i>

<i>They gave her the ability
to harness her emotions</i>

<i>to transform into a powerful,
mystical beast.</i>

<i>She was able
to fend off bandits,</i>

<i>protect her village,</i>

<i>and save her family from ruin.</i>

<i>Sun Yee passed this gift
to her daughters,</i>

<i>for when they came of age.</i>

And they passed it to theirs.

But over time,

our family chose
to come to a new world.

And what was a blessing
became...

an inconvenience.

Are you serious?

JIN: No!
Mei-Mei, no!

MEILIN: It's a curse!
She meant it as a blessing.

You cursed us!
It's all your fault!

Mei-Mei, stop!
Listen to me. Listen!

There's a cure!


Really? How do you know?

Because it happened to me.

Why didn't you warn me?

I thought I had more time!

You're just a child.

I thought, if I watched you
like a hawk,

I'd see the signs
and be able to prepare.

But it's going to be fine.
I overcame it

and you will too.

On the next red moon,

you'll undergo a ritual

that will seal
your red panda spirit

into one of these.

And then
you'll be cured for good.

Just like me.

But any strong emotion
will release the panda.

And the more you release it,

the more difficult
the ritual will be.

There is a darkness
to the panda, Mei-Mei.

You only have
one chance to banish it,

and you cannot fail.

Otherwise,
you'll never be free.

Let's see, the next red moon
will be the 25th.

That's a whole month away.

We'll wait it out together.

And I'll be with you
every step of the way.

(MEILIN PANTING, STRAINING)

(JIN GRUNTS)

Not bad.

I saved Wilfred.


It's only temporary, Mei-Mei.

This way, we won't worry about
any more accidents. Hmm?

Yeah! Whoo!
Go, Mei!

Thanks, guys.

Aw, we love you, Mei.
You're our girl.

Yeah. No matter what.
Panda or no panda.

(MEILIN SIGHS)

(MIRIAM GASPS)
Whoa.

Mei!
You're you!

And you look amazing!

Red looks so good on you.

Is it gone?

For now.
But if I get too excited,

it'll come right back... Ow!

Abby, what the heck?

Huh?

Something feels different.

Abby, hit me.

(GROANS)
(BODY THUDS)

MEILIN: (WEAKLY) Ow.

Oh, my gosh!

I stayed calm.

Something about you guys,
like, neutralizes the panda.

Aw! It's our love.

We're like a warm
and fuzzy blanket.

Yeah.

This means
I can have my room back.

have my life back!

No. Even better.

You can come with us
to 4-Town!

ABBY AND PRIYA: Yeah!

This could be our only chance
to see them together.

We're all asking
our parents tonight.

We're making our stand.

Yeah. You in or you out?

But I can't ask my mom.
I'm a furry ticking time bomb!

(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Of awesomeness!

(IN NORMAL VOICE)
And now you can control it!

So just prove it to her,
and she's gotta let you go!

MING: Mei-Mei?

Crap! You guys better go.

But...
No "buts," Mir.

My mom
already doesn't like you.

Wait, she doesn't?

I'll call you, I promise.

PRIYA: We love you, Mei.
ABBY: Hang in there, girl.

Everything okay?
I thought I heard...

Mom, I think
I've made a breakthrough.

Ready.

Deforestation.

How adorable.


How is this possible?
What happened to your panda?

It's easy.
When I start to get emotional,

all I do is imagine the people

I love most
in the whole world.

Oh.

Which is you guys.
Oh.

Oh, Mei-Mei.

(KITTEN PURRS)

So, now that that's settled,

I just have one
teeny-tiny favor to ask.

No. Absolutely not.


But this is
once in a lifetime.

Mei-Mei, it's one thing to
stay calm at home or school,

but a concert?

You'll get whipped up
into a frenzy

and panda all over the place.

I won't, I won't! I promise!

You saw me keep it in.

Ming, maybe
we should trust her.

It's them I don't trust.

Look at those
glittery delinquents

with their...

Why on earth
do you want to go so badly?

(ALL CHEERING)
ALL: Chug! Chug! Chug!


(ALL CHEERING)

Like I said,

I just want to broaden
my musical horizons.

This is filth.

And it's not worth
jeopardizing your life over.

Right, Jin?
Uh...

See? Your father agrees.
No concert. And that's final.

(INHALES SHARPLY)

Okay, well, thanks
for listening. Good night.



(DOOR SLAMS)
(SCOFFS)

What was that?

Am I the only one
who sees the danger here?

There's no way
she could keep her panda in.

And $200? For what?

Who do they think they are?
Celine Dion?

(PHONE RINGING)

Hmm. Unbelievable.
I saw that look.

Where did she get that from?

Treating her own mother
like that.

Hold on.
Ming, it's your mother.

I'm not here!

Mother. Hello.

I cited all my sources.

I had sparklers. (GRUNTS)
And she still said no!

My parents said
I could go when I'm 30.

Mine called it stripper music.

What's wrong with that?

Mine said yes,
but I have to buy the ticket.

Who the heck's
got that kind of cash? (YELPS)

I know my mom's worried,
but sometimes she's just so...

Dude, keep it together.

I can't. We need
to see this concert.

Why doesn't my mom get that?
I never ask for anything.

My whole life
I've been her perfect

little Mei-Mei.
Temple duties, grades...

Violin!
Tap dancing.

Yeah. We've been so good.

If they don't trust us anyway,
then what's the point?

Wow! Who are you?

I love it!
Fight the power!

Yeah. Yeah.

This isn't just
our first concert.

This is our first step
into womanhood.

And we have to do it together.

I'm in, girl. We'll say
it's a sleepover at my house.


Yes! My mom will never know.

Now we just got to
raise the money for tickets.


(ALL GRUNTING)

Know what'll help me think?

A little panda.

It'll clear my mind.

Just a little hit!

Get lost, Stacy.

But she's like a magical bear?

ALL: Red panda!

You are the cutest thing ever!

GIRL: Come out, please?

GIRL 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Our goal, four tickets.
That's 800 bucks!

Step one,
neutralize the empress.

Mathletes?
Isn't it a little dangerous

to join an after-school
club now?

What's dangerous
is an academic record

with a lack
of extracurriculars.

Hmm... Huh.

Step two... Spread the word.

<i>(U KNOW WHAT'S UP</i>

Come on, guys, keep going.


Check out Number 12.
He's got delts for days.

Forget that. I need lunch.
I'm starting to black out!

I think I'm getting
carpal tunnel.

No pain, no gain, Priya.

Come on, chop-chop!
Five, 10...

Girl, relax.

Yeah. We're doing our best.

It's not enough!

The concert's this Saturday

and we're still
a hundred short!

we should have charged

more for photos!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

Mei, breathe. It's in the bag.

But...
(TUTTING)

What's the point
of getting to the concert

if you're too exhausted
to enjoy it?

Now, take a break and help me
appreciate some boys.


(BOTH SIGH HEAVILY)

BOY: Hey, what's up?

BOY 2: Mei!

(PRIYA AND MIRIAM WHOOPING)

Looking good!
Nice calves!

Are you a triangle?
'Cause you acute!

(ALL GIGGLE)

TYLER: You guys are so weird.

Hey!
Are you spying on us?

I wanna talk to you, Lee.

Forget it.
Fine.

Wonder if your mom knows
her precious little Mei-Mei

has been flaunting the panda
all over school.

(GIRLS GASPING)

(MEILIN PANTING)
(POOFS)

That's none of your business!
(SHRIEKS)

One more step and
I'm telling her everything.

Now, put that thing away
and hear me out.

(GROWLS IN FRUSTRATION)

What do you want?

I wanna throw a sick
birthday party. An epic one.

It's this Friday.

If you're there,
everyone will come.

Simple as that.

A party?


Look, I've done you a favor
keeping my mouth shut.

All I'm asking for
is one back.

Hmm.

I'll do it.

But it'll cost you one...

No. Two hundred bucks.

Okay.

Uh, hold, please.

Are you serious?
You can't trust him.

It's a trap!

This sounds like
a boy-girl party.

Are we allowed
to boy-girl parties?

Guys! Two hundred bucks
will put us over the top!

We have to do this.

We'll meet at Tyler's,
I'll do my thing,

and then we'll bounce.
Easy-peasy.

Dude, what about your mom?

Forget my mom.

I'll be back before
she even knows I'm gone.

But...
Hey, dorkbag.

We're in. But you only
get the panda for an hour.

And we are not
bringing any presents.

Deal.

(DOOR OPENS)

(UTENSILS CLANKING)

Okay, I'm heading off
to mathletes. See you later!

Wait, what about dinner?
I made all your favorites.

(GASPS SOFTLY)

Thanks,
but Miriam's dad is, uh,

ordering pizza.
Save me leftovers?

What if I come with you?
Wha...

What are you doing?
Linear equations? Geometry?

I have a double-jointed elbow!

Look! I can make
a perfect circle!

Wow! Yeah, but it'll be
super boring.

Wouldn't you
rather hang with Dad?

Oh.

Let's get my flashcards.

But...
JIN: Hmm.

I was mathletes champ

in grade 8, you know?
Uh-huh.

They called me
the "Uncommon Denominator."

Cool. Oh, uh,
<i>Jade Palace</i> is on tonight.

Can't miss that, right?
Now, who's the weak link?

Priya and Abby
seem bright enough, but...

Oh, and traffic's a nightmare.

I can just
take the streetcar...

you stay and rest.
(INHALES) Miriam...

I mean, she's a nice girl,

but maybe
she's slowing you down.

Oh, Mom, you really
don't have to come.

Don't be silly.
We're already on the way.

(BREATHING NERVOUSLY)

But I don't want you to!

WOMAN: Hey, cuz! Surprise!

Aunties?
What are you doing here?

The ritual, silly.

She's lost weight.
No, no, she gained weight.

She looks like her mother.
She looks like her father.

GRANDMA: Ladies.

Mother.

Hey, Grandma.

GRANDMA: Poor dear.

It must be so difficult

keeping that
unruly beast at bay.

Your family is here now,
Mei-Mei.

And we will take care
of everything.

Who's up for some Boggle?

AUNT 1: Eat. You need
your strength for the ritual.

(AUNTIES FUSSING)
(MUFFLED) Thank you, aunties.

Your hair is so thick,
like a pelt.

MING: What a surprise
that you all came so early.

You need all the help
you can get, Ming.

So, Mei-Mei,
you've been managing

to keep the panda in?

Yep. Totally.
(SCOFFS) Really?

What's that, Lily?

Well, it's a little hard
to believe

that Mei-Mei
could control such a beast.

She's just a child.

It's true.
And if Mei-Mei's panda

is anything like Ming's...
(ALL GROAN AND SHUDDER)

Mei-Mei's better
than any of us

at controlling the panda.

She passed every trigger test.
Even the kitten box.

AUNTIES: Oh!
LILY: Oh, my goodness!

That's unbelievable.
Impressive.

She just thinks
of my love for her,

and it gives her the strength
to stay calm.

Exactly.

AUNTIES: Aw.
How sweet.

How sweet.
(YAWNING)

Anyway,
thanks for all the gifts,

but I think I'll go
to bed early. (CHUCKLES)

Keeping that animal
locked down

sure takes a lot of energy.

Okay, sweetie. Get some rest.

Night, everyone.

AUNTIES: Good night, Mei-Mei.
Sleep well.

LILY: Get some beauty rest.
AUNT: Get some rest.

(AUNTIES CHATTERING)


Oh!

(GLASS SHATTERS)

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)

Mei-Mei, can I have a word
with you?

Uh, sure. What's up?

(MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

I found this.

Strange for a girl
who hasn't let her panda out.

It's, uh... (CHUCKLES)

It's not mine.

Mei-Mei,
I know what you're doing.

I know how hard it is
to keep the beast in.

It feels so good
to let it out. So free.

But each time you do,
the stronger it gets.

And then you'll be
bound to it forever,

and the ritual will fail.

Has that ever happened?

It cannot happen.


Your mother and I
were close once,

but the red panda
took that away.

I couldn't bear to see
that happen to you.

So, no more panda.

You are your mother's
whole world, Mei-Mei.

I know you'll do what's right.

Uh-uh. Mmm. Mmm!

Uh, worm.
Uh... Octopus!

Spaghetti?
Killer robot!

Mortality.

Hmm. Nice.

This sucks.

Let's bail.
Just wait. She'll be here.

I knew she'd flake.

Yo! What up, peeps? (LAUGHS)

What are you wearing?

Hey, Tyler. Happy birthday.

I'm paying for the red panda,
not this garbage! Deal's off!

Wait! Can garbage do this?

Or this? Stir the porridge.

Come on, guys!
Stir the porridge. (GRUNTS)

Are you feeling okay?

to explain, but just, hmm...

Just trust me on this.

I can't panda anymore.
I'm sorry.

Okay, okay, okay. It's fine.

You don't have to do it.

We'll just, uh,
figure something...

I won't go.

What? Priya, you can't not go.

Jesse's your soul mate.

But we only have enough

for three tickets.
Then I'll stay home.

Abby, no! I'll stay home.

Guys, if we can't all go,

then none of us should go.

Right?

Four is the worst number.

You know,
Vivian was due on the fourth,

Hurry up, everyone.

to start the ritual.

Nervous, Mei-Mei?

A little.
Oh, well,

This will be a piece of cake.

And mostly painless.


Wait, "mostly"?

The panda's dangerous,

Huh. You sound

What has she told you
about her panda?

She won't talk about it.

It was quite destructive.


She almost took out
half the temple.

You... You saw it?

Only once.

She and your grandma
had a terrible fight.

Over what?

Your grandma
didn't approve of me.

But you should've seen
your mom.

She was incredible.

But I'm a monster.

(JIN SIGHS)

People have all kinds
of sides to them, Mei.

And some sides are messy.

The point isn't to push
the bad stuff away,

it's to make room for it,

Mei, erase it if you want,
but this side of you...
