Getyour tickets here,
ladies and gentlemen...

for the most frightening show
you've ever seen in your life!

Step right up!

That one is closed right now, sir.

This way, please.

Ladies and gentlemen,
before we go on...

I must ask...

that anyone easily impressed...

or suffering ofa weak heart,
leave the tent now.

And the children too.
Madam, please, for shame.

Now, you have all heard bone-chilling
rumors ofthe walking dead.

In the West Indies,
authorities are baffled...

by gruesome crime sprees...

committed by men
with the strength ofan army.

''Zombies,'' they call them!
Strange word, I know.

Make no mistake,
the zombie is a savage soul...

with no conscience.

And ifprovoked, can and will...

rip the guts out ofeach and every
living being here tonight.

You have been warned.

Remember me?
It's Angus, your friend.

I've brought some nice people
who want to meetyou.

There's no reason to be afraid.

For God's sake,
he looks like my uncle Fergus.

Please, sir, be quiet.
You hear me? I demand me money back!

Sir, for God's sake,
just get to the back ofthe tent.

Be quiet. We will giveyou
your money back.

What's wrong with you people? Can'tyou
seeyou're being played for fools?

That's not a zombie.
It's some clown dressed up in rags.

Get out ofhere, for God sakes!
Please be quiet!

Please! No, I beg you!

Please, please!
Please don't hurt me!

He's in that tent over there!

Get 'em out ofhere.
Get 'em all out ofhere.

Show's over.

It's clear.

We're clear, Terry.

Not bad.
Not bad at all.

Angus, Terry says I can't come out
for a drinkwith everybody.

We've been
through this before, Bailey.

Zombies can't be seen
having a drink down at the local.

Ruins the illusion.
But it's our last night here.

Doesn't matter. The gladiators didn't
suddenly nip out for a tortellini...

after the lions torn 'em up, did they?

Man, I strike the tents
every town we been in.

It's high time somebody else
get stuckwith thejob.

Welcome to show business, kid.

Knock, knock, princess.
How'd we do?

Our best nightyet.
We're going out with a bang.

You were terrific.
Butyou already know that.

Here is to the most beautiful creature
this planet has ever known...

and the most accomplished performer
this sorry bunch ever laid eyes upon.

Cheers.

To the most charming charlatan
I've ever allowed under my skirt.

And to the Ringling Brothers
and their 40 railroad cars...

traveling all overAmerica.

Here we go.
Bloody right.

Sir?

You are no mermaid.
Sir, you're not allowed--

You're no colossal beast
from the sea.

That is true, sir,
I'm an actress.

A liar!

Well, that's one way oflooking at it.
Look, we intended no harm.

The show's over, sir.
You're not even allowed to be in here.

You are no mermaid.
I thinkwe've established that, sir.

Ifyou'djust kindly step outside.
You're a fake.

Madam, you'rejust a fake.

Sir?

I'm sorry.

I apologize.
I'm so sorry.

It's quite all right, sir.

Come on, sir.
Good evening, sir. I'm so sorry.

Can we offeryou a ride home, sir?

Please be kind enough
to wait in the dining room.

I don't leave the house much
these days...

not since mywife passed away.

I'm sorry to hear that.
Pleasejoin me for some ofthe best.

Certainly.

Areyou married?

Notyet.

Doyou live byyourself?

I thought I heard you
talking to someone.

I live by myself,
but not alone.

You're right to think me strange...

butyou'd be strange too...

ifyou knew what I know.

We don't thinkyou strange.

All water holds hidden magic.

Without it
there can be no life on Earth.

But what I am telling you
is not magic.

You understand?

Absolutely. And yet,
at the risk ofsounding--

For thousands ofyears...

men have believed in an enclave
ofislands...

known as the Forbidden Islands...

where mermaids breed.

In Greek mythology,
sirens were originally bird women.

Then, somewhere along the line
they mutated into fish women.

But like I said,
that is Greek mythology.

Mermaids are myths.

Everybody knows that.

They sing, they dance...

they lure the sailors to their lair
with their pale flesh.

And the story goes
that everyyear...

under the strongest
ofthe full moon...

usually in summer...

the mermaid becomes human
for roughly one night.

That's right. Human.

Legs, feet and all.

Quaint little maidens.

Virginal...

innocent...

meek as sin.

Now, who would believe
an extraordinary story like that?

This one has a rather unfortunate
skin condition.

That is the Queen ofthe Lair.

Different cultures have
different names for her--

Moreski, Rudi,
Coralia, Sihrena.

But they all share
one thing in common.

They all say her name
in hushed tones.

She has powers
the others don't.

Certain pagan religions
esteem her...

the highest offertility symbols.

You must go.

Well, you know, it'sjust--
Yes, I understand. I wasn't always...

old and incoherent.

Thankyou for bringing me home.
Our pleasure.

Certainly.

You didn't believe a word,
did you?

Oh, sure we did, everything.

It'sjust that we'll be traveling soon,
and we need our rest.

I came toyour show tonight
because I believed...

thatyou'd captured a real one,
and I wanted to warn you ofthe danger.

Like we explained, it's an illusion.
You know, entertainment.

I believeyou, sir.

Come with me. Come.

Now we're never getting out ofhere.

That is fantastic.

She looks so real.

That is remarkable.

Has she been underwater
the whole time we've been here?

How does she make it
so her skin doesn't get all wrinkled?

Don't get close.

Is it a see-through breathing tube?
Is it a straw?

How does she do it?

She's not used to strangers.

She's very ill.

Why the chains?
She's broken the glass repeatedly.

I had to build the cage around her.

Oh, stop it. Go on.
Tell me how it's done.

Go on, I beg you.

She murdered mywife.

That's all I see when I look at her,
and she knows it.

It is a goddamn mermaid, isn't it?

You'd love to show her
as a freak attraction.

Is that whatyou're thinking, sir?
No, ofcourse not.

But we could deliver her to a scientific
institution where she might be studied.

It seems a shame to deprive
the modern world ofthe insights--

The answer is no.

Perhaps sleep on it?

I'm not much ofa sleeper, sir.
Not anymore.

You'll driveyourselfmad, darling.

Perhaps it's meant to be.
Nah, how could it be?

All my life I've been concocting
extraordinary schemes to dazzle a crowd.

I have never come across the real McCoy.
No one I've heard ofever does.

Oh, brother, here come superlatives.

The ''nevers'' and the ''evers''
and the ''chance ofa lifetimes.''

You could forget the Ringling Brothers.
Go straight to Madison Square Garden.

Present the world with
the greatest find ofthe century.

Have a little faith.
The century'sjust begun.

Besides, I thought I was the star
mermaid ofthis show.

Am I not?

Yeah, sureyou are, darling.

Come on.

Has Bailey gone to bed already?
Yes, sir.

But not alone.
What doyou mean?

-The Siamese trapeze twins are in there.
-Both ofthem?

Being the star ofthe show
has its perks.

Welcome to show business, kid.
Well, go wake him up.

Tell him he'll be back in action
in 1 5 minutes.

I warned you--
I'm not much ofa sleeper.

Captain Woolrich, ifyoujust allow me
to explain my proposal.

I'm sure it's very civilized.

I loan you the creature...

and then you make a name foryourself
in the world...

and share the profits with me.

Butyou skipped the part
where the creature...

bites the hand that feeds it...

and you end up a paranoid old fool...

staring at her day and night,
and night and day and day and night.

That's perceptive ofyou, but--

Shut up.

The creature will not leave
this house.

God knows...

I've earned the privilege
to see her die.

Why not put the weapon down, Captain?

You have no right.

-Just calm down now, sir.
You've no right.

My pills.

Get out ofmy house!

I said calm down.

Jesus Christ, Bailey,
I thinkyou killed him.

Sir!

Oh, no, please don't, sir!

Oh, God, I'm going to hell.

Fifteen minutes ago I was in bed
with the twins. Now I'm going to hell.

Nobody is going tojail!
Understand? Nobody.

Hell, I said.
I'm going to hell.

I can't helpyou there.
First things first.

He never left the house. He has
supplies brought in once a week.

It'll be weeks
before anyone finds him.

I did the most horrible thing
a person can do.

It was an accident!
We all saw it, it was self-defense.

Sir!

You sure she won't wake up?
Positive.

That's enough to put down
two adult elephants.

What about the tank?
We'll have to empty it to move it.

What's in the book?

The old man's wife wrote down
her observations on the creature.

Come on, let's get outta here.

All right, take her up!

All right, then. Where's your
Mr. Shaw and the last passenger?

They'll be here momentarily.
Better be. We're leaving soon.

All hands prepare to get underway!

Haveyou gone completely mad?
-Jesus Christ, Lily, what's in here?

My costumes. You sneak out
in the middle ofthe night...

to purchase a creature we don't know
the first thing about.

Scratch that. We do know something.
She murdered the old Captain's wife.

He said that at first,
but he changed his story around.

He's an old drunk, you know?

But the rest ofthe troupe,
we can'tjust leave them behind.

They'll bejoining us in two weeks
as planned.

This is wrong, Angus.
This whole idea.

What about it is wrong?

To have that thing in a tank,
for starters, is wrong.

I'll tell you what's wrong.
What is wrong is me and you...

stuck in some small town,
barely surviving on scraps.

Me up there like a monkey
trying to lure poor idiots...

into falling for smoke and mirrors...

whilstyou batyour eyelashes
and stickyour chest out.

That's what's wrong.

Ifyou think Ringling Brothers give
a hoot about our quaint little act...

just because we have charming
personalities and elocution--

It doesn't work that way.

This life, you see a chance,
you take it.

Yes, sir, you need something
to makeyou stick out from the crowd.

And for God sakes,
a real life bleedin' mermaid.

Something no one's ever seen before.
This is history...

and archaeology and spectacle
all rolled into one.

This is our ticket, Lily.

I have a bad feeling
about this, Angus.

Mixed feelings are good.
Keeps you balanced.

I didn't say mixed.
I said bad.

Well, there must be something
you like to eat then, isn't there?

You and me both, lady.

I can't understand a word
you're saying, so why even try?

Let's keep it quiet now, shall we?
Potato?

What is it?

A curious somebody, huh?
Is that it?

I'll go check.

Please,just relax.
Calm down.

Was thatyoujust now?
What?

You wanna come in?

You keep quiet now, all right?
You're gonna get us all in trouble.

Come inside, now.

Thank God.

Methinks she likeyou better
than me.

Angus tells meyou're a famous artist
ofthe stage, Miss Lily.

One ofthese actresses.
Angus tends to exaggerate.

It's part ofthejob description,
but not in this case.

Fascinating life, I'd imagine,
the life on the stage.

Me, I never understood how anybody
could remember all those words...

all at once, night after night, eh?

Is it all it's cracked up to be?
Sorry. Excuse me.

She's not used to the motion.
That's the problem with most women.

Either that, or she's with child.

Not Lily.
I notice the African fellow...

spends a lot oftime
in the cargo compartment.

I'm not opposed to him mingling.

Thanks, I'll let him know that.
Just a bit shy.

Hey, Miles, thought I asked you
to fix that rigging yesterday.

Yes, sir, you did.

I broughtyou a little something.
Thankyou.

At least someone's looking healthier.

I don't know why.
She hasn't touched food since we left.

Well, it could be the ocean air.

Her skin is much better.

Doyou want me to take over
for a bit?

I could use a bit ofa stretch.

Gifford is gonna be back in a bit.
All right.

Good morning.
How areyou today?

We're gonna have to nameyou
something, you know.

We all need a name.

Not much ofa talker, though.

That's all right.

What's important is
thatyou're feeling better.

Aren'tyou?

What areyou thinking, I wonder?
What doyou make ofall this?

Oh, God, that was you.

You caught me by surprise.
You're moving much quicker.

Well, that's veryinteresting,
says I, becausehe'sa dunce.

Never reached the second book.

I'll be with you in a minute, darling.

Did I tell you
about the hangman and the hawk?

Bedtime, is it, Miss Lillian?

Yes.

No, thankyou.

Suityourself. More for me.

I'm sorry, that wasn't very
gentlemanlike ofme, was it?

It's hard sometimes.
We're not used to traveling with dames.

I understand.
Must be awful foryou...

listening to all this sailor talk
day and night...

so crass and profane, isn't it?

It doesn't bother me.

You are a politeyoung lady,
ifI may.

I once knew a young lady
in London.

I hesitate to call her a lady,
but she certainlywas feminine.

Not refined, such as yourself,
ofcourse...

but she was-- oh, God--
rather, what's the proper term--

a resourceful girl.

Charming, full oflife.

Wouldn't be accurate to call her
an easywoman, 'cause easy she wasn't.

MaryAnn, that was her name.

MaryAnn was barren...

which made her chosen profession
all the easier.

She had a sad tale ofwoe
regarding her condition.

Backroom operationjust off
the London port. Sad stuff.

We spent a whole month together.

She stole my heart...

which wouldn't have been so bad
ifshe hadn't stolen all my money.

Now, mind you, and I'm not
too embarrassed to admit it...

mind you,
she had charged me handsomely...

for the pleasure ofher acquaintance,
and even so...

I wake up one morning,
and she's gone with everything I own.

Can you believe that?

That's awful.
What'd you say?

I said, that's awful--
your tale ofmisfortune.

Quite awful.

The ''awfulest.''

Didn't make me feel any better
to find out...

that she had done this
to a dozen sailors before me.

Like I said, MaryAnn was
a very resourceful girl...

not a lady such as yourself.

What have we here, Miss Lillian?

Seems likeyou have
a loose thread.

I'll find it later, thankyou.

I hope I didn't scareyou...

butyou don't strike me
as the type to scare easily.

I must go now.

She had the sweetest mole-- MaryAnn--

right between her breasts.

I'm sure she did.
Good night, sir.

Not Angus.

Miles.
I said Miles.

Angus, wake up.
Wake up, man, wake up!

They found her.

I'm telling you, don't be fooled
bywhat it appears to be.

It's a curse on the boat.

Pure evil.
We're better offto kill it now.

It's all right, it's all right.

You knew about this?
Yes, sir, I can explain.

I don't think any explanation
could satisfy.

Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't throw this thing...

offmy ship right now
and you with it!

Ifyoujust let my men get her back down
into her tank, and you and I can talk.

I've had men flogged to death
for less.

Give me one good reason, Mr. Shaw.

I'll giveyou more good reasons
than you could ever imagine.

Go on, get rid ofher.

Miles, come with me.

-He's not here, Captain.
-Find him, tell him to come to my cabin.

It's as ifshe's drunk.

Think ofit as the greatest treasure
any man has ever discovered.

What about my crew?

This is an advance.
More to come later.

You divideyour share
anywhich wayyou see fair.

I think I'm being
more than generous here.

Yes.

Can't find Miles, sir.
He must be down below.

Let him sleep it off.
Thanks, Skelly.

What about their safety?
I have a responsibility.

So we'll be careful.

Putyourselfin my shoes.
What would you have done?

I had no way ofknowing
you'd even accept the cargo.

But believe me when I tell you,
Captain...

you're looking at a good luck charm
ofa lifetime.

This is not an opportunity
you want to throw away.

Excuse me.

What happened?

She almost made it to the railing,
and then shejust dropped.

Come on, now, everybody.

On three, fellas, three!

One, two, three.

Yes, she's heavy.
Get her in here.

Yes, one, two, three.

All right, fellas, thankyou,
show's over. Let's get some sleep now.

Very sorry about that, fellas.
We made a mistake, no harm done.

She won't escape again.

I'm going up for some fresh air.
It reeks in here.

That was--

You were quite forceful, darling.
Sorry.

No, I like it.

Perhaps the ocean air
is bringing out the animal in you.

Look, Angus, we have to talk.

You know I hate conversations
that start with, ''Look, Angus.''

It's about me.

Then I am interested.
As long as it's not about me.

I'm bored to the hilt with me.

My past is quite different
than what I've told you.

For one, I was never
a famous actress in London.

And I was never a champion swimmer.
In fact, I can't even swim.

I wasn't on holidaywhen you and I met.
I was running away.

There were men.

There were several men
with whom I became acquainted.

You understand?

I don't care whatyou were
orwhatyou did beforeyou met me.

I'm in love with the woman
you are now.

The fact is,
I'm no saint meself.

But that's not all.

Miles was one ofthe men
I knew back in London.

The Yankee sailor boy?

That Miles.

No, I didn't steal it.

Look, I had a nasty conversation
last night and he was cross with me.

Why didn'tyou tell me?

Ifthis character has any claim on you,
I will straighten him out.

You can't.
Oh, yes, I can.

He may be a big fella, but he'll be
hungover. I'll have the upper hand.

That'sjust it.
You won't find him. He's dead.

What doyou mean?
I think she ate him.

Who ate him?
The mermaid!

She did it as a favor to me, see.

Miles was drunk as a skunk...

and that's why she became intoxicated
and couldn't escape.

I thinkyou might be running a fever.
No, listen to me.

I know how it sounds,
but I really believe...

that she can read my thoughts,
and she did this for me.

Listen toyourself. A mind-reading
mermaid who avenges women with a past.

It sounds like something
we'd cook up together for the show.

I'll seeyou at breakfast.

But we have to set her free.

Look, Lily,
I know all about guilt.

I've been trying to outwit it
my entire life...

and there isn't a chance in hell that
we're gonna set free that creature...

just because ofsome nonsense psychic
poweryou think she's got overyou.

Are we clear?

''I'm not ajournal writer.
I am just scared.

My name is Teresa Woolrich.
Theyear is 1 904.

Hehadneverheardofa creature

than three weeks in captivity.

Why is this one different?

He wanted to take her backwith him.

I cannot tell him
what I see in my dreams.

I do not believe
that they are dreams.''

Howyou doing, sweets?

Oh, I have a problem.

Anything I can helpyou with?

I don't suppose so.
It's about Captain Woolrich.

Somethingjust doesn't add up.
About what?

Did anything funny happen that night?

Nothing funny at all,
just business talk.

Thanks, Bailey.

You're welcome.

Forwhat? What did I do?

You reveal when you lie.

The right side ofyour lip goes up.
I wasjust chewing.

I know. Bon appétit.

You all right?
Yes.

Some sort ofcramp, I guess.

Hereyou go.

You're a son ofa bitch, Angus.

You're in a swell mood.

Did you read this?

Is that what's upsetting you?
What'reyou looking in that for?

Did you read it?

I leafed through it. Sure.

You leafed through it?
You leafed through...

''I know she's taken ahold ofhim
completely and knows my every thought.

Sometimes she answers when I have not
spoken out loud, so I am trapped.

I cannot kill her
because she knows it's coming.''

You read that, the very last entry?

Not that part. It'sjust
the crazy ramblings ofhis wife.

She sounds completely sane to me.

She sounds like someone who meticulously
recorded her descent into despair.

-She gives facts, dates.
-What ofit? Her husband was crazy too.

''Was,'' you said?
Her husband was crazy?

Is crazy. Her husband is crazy.

Why don'tyoujust interrogate me?

-What happened that night with Woolrich?
-I already told you.

He gave us his blessing.
He gave us the book...

for reference purposes.

He didn't giveyou this book,
no matter how crazy he was.

You been talking to Bailey?
I didn't wantyou to worry--

Bailey said nothing.
Woolrich didn't giveyou this book...

because his wife admits right here...

that they murdered two people
to feed the creature.

Not to mention it's clear
that she herselfwound up as dinner.

Nobody's crazy enough to hand over
three murder confessionsjust like that.

It was an accident.

Bailey pushed him too hard.

The creature ate Miles.
You know it.

Let me hearyou say it.
Please don't treat me like I'm crazy.

Yeah, you're probably right.

And you'rejust going to ignore that
it's only time before she kills again?

This is what she does.
It's her nature.

I don't see the point
in getting everyone hysterical.

They already mourned Miles.
They said it was an accident.

Now all you have to do
is keep away from the tank.

She can get out.
How?

There's chains and metal and glass.

Is she like this Houdini?

Bailey already admitted
he fell asleep that night.

Maybe Miles walked in,
saw her and opened the cage himself.

You're willing to take that chance?
You know me a little, Lily.

I'm not a murderer. But hell, yes,
I am willing to take that chance.

Hereyou go, Captain.

Thankyou.

Skelly?

Yes?
Can I helpyou with something?

I don't care how much treasure
we're promised.

That beast doesn't belong here.

Right. Well, you should talk
to the captain.

Yes.

Well, I'll be moving on now.

Notyet, notyet, notyet.

Hold on, hold on.

Stop! Please, stop!

I'm so sorry.

What the hell is wrong with you?

I'm so sorry.

Lily, forceful is one thing,
but this is mad.

I know, I know. I don't know--

I do.

What is ityou want from me? Huh?

Say it!

Look, I knowyou can understand me...

and I knowyou're playing
some sort ofgame.

But I wantyou out ofmy head
and out ofmy body.

Areyou listening to me?

Do something.

Blink twice or tap the glass,
wag your tail.

Shit!

Oh, my God, what am I doing?

Angus.

What did you say?

What did you say?

You are not to touch him.
You leave him the hell alone!

Go on.

Go on.

The coast is clear. Go.

Isn't this whatyou wanted?
What areyou waiting for? Go!

Baileywill be back any minute.

Oh, Lily, what haveyou done?

Ensigns down below!
Getyour hands here.

Oh, Holy Mary!

I swear to God,
you have to believe me.

You defied me. Listen to me.
Bailey is dead. Is that whatyou wanted?

Please believe me. She wants
to hurtyou. She told me. Please!

Please don't leave me.
I beg ofyou.

What am I supposed to do?
You've become completely unstable.

I'm begging you. I'm so scared.
Please, don't leave me alone.

You have to calm down.

I'll do anything. Please--
We'll talk in the morning.

Please, I'm calm, I'm calm.

Angus? Areyou there?

''Manborn ofa womanhasbutashort
time toliveandis fullofmisery.

He cometh up and is cut down
like a flower.

He fleeth as were a shadow.

He never continueth in one stay.''

In the name ofthe Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

Amen.

Bye, Bailey.

Come on, Lily, talk to me.

I'm sorryyou have to be in here.
Now, please.

What I don't understand
is why she's lasted so long.

Let's not talk about that.

According to the museum expert, 3 weeks
is the most they last in captivity.

You haven't eaten anything.
Maybe later. I'm not hungry.

Maybe ifwe talked about
something else.

Unless, ofcourse, it has to do
with the feeding pattern.

Ifhuman flesh is what they eat,
which has been established...

all those stories about mermaids
luring in the sailors...

now we know what
they lured them in for.

Lunch!

Still, how could she have lasted on only
three bodies while with the Woolriches?

You know what I mean?
Will you stop this?

It doesn't make any sense.
Something about her is different.

You're right, Lily.

It doesn't make any sense.
And you're beginning to scare me.

I need you to bring the book back.

Lily, no!
Prisoners don't get to read?

You're not a prisoner.
The captainjust said--

I am a prisoner, and you think
I've lost my mind.

Well, I will lose my mind ifyou don't
give me something to do all day in here!

Get me the book!

Pretty please?
I need to know.

Thankyou.

''I know that due to my age,
it is medically impossible...

into His own hand.

I'm afraid she has put this in me.''

''Medically impossible unless the Lord
has taken matters into His own hand.

I'm afraid she has put this in me.''

Holy Mother ofGod.

I'm not crazy.

I am not crazy.

I'm acting crazy
and I recognize it...

and that is how I know I am not.

Crazy, that is.

Look, Angus...

I know I've been acting--

I realize how I must seem.

I'm very affected
by this whole thing--

All right.

Look...

I know it is physically,
medically...

impossible for me to be with child.

Angus, I know that.
Ofcourse I do.

I wouldn't be saying any ofthis
ifI didn't find it...

extraordinary!

What if Mrs. Woolrich was right?

What ifshe wasn't crazy?

What ifshe became...

impregnated somehow?

What if Mrs. Woolrich was right?
What ifshe wasn't crazy?

What if...

she became...

impregnated somehow?

What ifshe wasn't crazy?

What if--

For argument's sake,
what if Mrs. Woolrich...

what ifshe was right?

What ifshe wasn't crazy?

What ifshe became impregnated somehow?

Come out, come out,
whereveryou are.

I knowyou're here.

I knowyou can't help doing
the things you do.

That's not my fault.

It's a full moon.
That's whyyou didn't escape before.

Becauseyou knew that soon
you'd be changing form.

All right. Here, here.
It's all right.

Thereyou are.

I'm all right. I don't think
she's going to try anything.

Nobody fires unless I say so.

Get away from her!
Please. Please.

Shoot her! Shoot her!

You gave me such a fright.

Don't ever do that again.

I thought I'd lostyou.

A good night's rest
is in order foryou.

This is Dr. Angus speaking, not me.

I'll just go downstairs,
make sure everything's all right.

I fainted.
I know.

It's perfectly normal,
given the circumstances.

I fainted because I'm with child.

You fainted becauseyou're
in a tense and volatile situation.

But there's something inside me.
I can feel it move.

You're very tired,
and you haven't been eating properly...

and you're very distressed.

You don't know the halfofit.

She'snotso toughanymore, isshe?

She'snotso toughanymore, isshe?

Take it easy.
She might sprout tail any moment.

Does she stay human?

I'll tell you what, she'll need
a proper place to sleep tonight.

There's plenty ofroom in my bunk
ifshe'll promise not to bite me.

What kind ofa woman is she, anyway?
What doyou thinkyou're doing?

Making sure she's a natural blonde,
that's all.

Maybe we should leave her alone.
There's no telling what she'll do.

Let the men have some fun.
God knows, they've earned it.

A deafand dumb maiden.
I like that in a woman.

Now, now, easy does it.

I've seen you watching me
from the tank...

wanting to make a meal
out ofme.

Leave her alone!

What's your problem?

This is a private party.

No circus clowns invited.

I think she's thirsty.

You're right.
How inconsiderate ofme.

Hold her. That's it.
Here we go. That's a good girl.

Where areyou going, circus boy?

Areyou going to call in
the ringmaster?

Acting the clown's one thing, but
you're playing with everyone's safety.

Is thatyour expert opinion
on the subject?

You have no idea
whatyou're talking about.

You think my men are playing with
your safety? Is that whatyou think?

You don't know this little whore,
Gifford.

You have no idea what--

None ofyou have a chance!
None ofyou!

You don't know what she's done!

What happened?
Son ofa bitch nearly started a riot.

You don't know what she did.
You haven't a clue.

That's enough!

Oh, God!

You have no idea...

what she's made me do.

Butyou'll find out.

All right, calm down.

Come on, Captain.
You and me need a little talk.

Sit down. Sit down!
You and I have to talk.

Everyone is a bit overexcited now.

But here we go.
Start from the beginning.

Gifford, come over here.

Holy Mother ofJesus!

It's nothing. Thunder.
I don't like it.

I'm pregnant, aren't I?

I always wanted a baby.

I'm scared.

Is it--

Is it normal?

What on earth was that?

What's happening?

See that over there?
Like a mass ofshadows?

Yes, I see it.

That's an island. A group ofislands.
So?

So it's the queerest thing.
There is no group ofisland like such...

in the path to New York Harbor.

Not unless the captain read
the charts wrong.

She brought us home.

Get that sail up now!

Rocks dead ahead.
Right full rudder.

I don't care whatyou do,
just turn this thing around.

I can't. We don't have room.

Go below. Check for damage.

That must hurt.

Please don't hurt me!

That doesn't sound like thunder.

That's more like it.

You've done it now. Come on!

Go!
You go.

Where's Lily?

I don't know.
That thing, it's not the mermaid.

What areyou talking about?
It's something else. Darts won't work.

You can put down an elephant
with one ofthese things.

You told me that before.
Trust me, this is not an elephant.

The bullets are in
the captain's quarters. Come on.

I just came from there,
and I'm not going back.

Fine. Stay.

Don't make a sound.

I'm going to check the hatchway.

Let's move. We're sitting ducks here.
You go. I'll go find Lily.

Go where? Where's the rest ofthe crew?
We need a plan.

The plan is to find Lily and then
shoot the thing out ofthe water.

You haven't seen it. It's got claws
like knives and horns out to here.

What doyou want me to do?
Ifyou've a better idea, tell me!

Lily!Jesus, areyou all right?

Move, move, move!

Here's the rest ofthe crew.

What the devil is that thing?

It's the Queen ofthe Lair
Woolrich warned us about.

The queen ofthe what?
What areyou talking about?

It doesn't matter. The question is,
what is she going to do?

Feed us to her lair.

Doyou mean there's more?

An island full ofmermaids.
That's why she brought us here.

She's the provider.

But no one gets to see the
Forbidden Islands and walk out alive.

That's how they've lasted so long.

And you knew about this?
I told you all I knew.

You told me, let's take a mermaid
to America, get rich and famous.

Not, steal the queen ofwhat's-it who
turns into a monster and eats people.

I would've remembered
the difference.

Stop it.

I'm not waiting around down here.

I'm going up.

Let's get outta here.

God Almighty, ifYou're up there,
ifYou're watching down on us...

please, we have learned our lesson.

Please save us.

I reallywanted to have
a future with you, to grow old with you.

This is all my fault.
I loveyou so much.

I loveyou too!

Stop!

Stop!

Please don't hurt us.

Jesus Christ!

Miss, what happened?

Where's your crew?
