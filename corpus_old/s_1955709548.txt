"Dear Sir or Madam,

"I sincerely apologize
for crashing into your car.

"But don't worry.
My boss, Scrooge McDuck,

will happily pay for--"

Uh...

"--will pay for
any damages.

"One time I crashed
his limo into a campsite,

"and one of the RVs
caught fire.

"No one was hurt.

"We roasted hot dogs
on the fire,

"and Mr. McDee paid
for the whole thing,

"including the hospital bill
after I ate too many hot dogs.

"He's a good guy.

"Anyway, I'm very sorry
about your car,

"but a good mechanic
should be able to

"buff that dent out,
no problem.

Your friend,
Launchpad McQuack."

[car alarms blaring]

"Dear Sir or Madam...
