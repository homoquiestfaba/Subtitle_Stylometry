<i>Here we are in the 12th
and final round.</i>

<i>It's been a brutal fight
between xao</i>

<i>and the world champion
chance o'brien.</i>

<i>They're having a chance to fight</i>

<i>with one another
that has escalated</i>

<i>this battle into a war.</i>

<i>Xao has cyber enhancements</i>

<i>that seem to give him the
strength to stay with o'brien,</i>

<i>who is one of the few 100%
human fighters still competing.</i>

<i>O'brien has the speed,
power and skill</i>

<i>well beyond any current fighter
of any grade,</i>

<i>cyber-enhanced or human.</i>

<i>Down! Down! This could be it!</i>

<i>The electronic timer
counts away the seconds!</i>

<i>Eight, nine, 10!</i>

<i>Chance o'brien
has reclaimed his championship</i>

<i>with a stunning
twelfth-round knockout</i>

<i>of previously unbeaten xao.</i>

<i>O'brien's unorthodox manager,</i>

<i>Jo, has leaped into the ring
to congratulate her fighter.</i>

<i>What will the rematch be like?</i>

<i>It is a crucial time
for our company.</i>

<i>Competition
with other corporations</i>

<i>is disrupting our market share.</i>

<i>We have gone from 53% to 39%
in two years.</i>

<i>The zikan corporation alone</i>

<i>has penetrated 10%
into our coverage</i>

<i>in the last eight months.</i>

And the public knows it.

You gentlemen

<i>have allowed it to happen.</i>

Mr. tung, as head
of the marketing division,

what do you propose?

We need to demonstrate

the superiority
of our bioengineered implants

in a vivid, spectacular fashion,

which means we need to pit
our cyber enhancements

<i>against all the others
in direct competition</i>

<i>on a world stage for all to see.</i>

It would be the media event
of all time.

All very noble, Mr. tung,

but how is such a goal attained?

We sponsor a fighting tournament

where all the greatest fighters
in the world are invited.

<i>Each corporation will bioenhance
a combatant of their choice.</i>

The best cyber technology wins.

Simple!

It would be the super bowl,
world cup, and Olympics

<i>rolled up in
one multimedia mega-event.</i>

<i>Think of the marketing bonanza.</i>

This is a crazy dream.

No corporation
is going to sponsor an event

where people could be killed.

Just last week
a football player was paralyzed,

and in a speed car race

two drivers
were burned to death.

<i>It's part of the public lure.</i>

The public doesn't hold
the sponsor responsible,

unless of course

the entertainment
is of poor quality.

It's ridiculous.

Each journey
begins with a single step.

The tournament
may be that step higher,

but it is crucial

that the step
be in the right direction.

You're confident
you do have a man who can

<i>win this tournament?</i>

As a matter of fact, I do.

Gentlemen, this is xao.

<i>He has agreed
to be our representative</i>

<i>in the tournament.</i>

The one who lost the bout
to a pure human, an American.

That was before
some changes were made.

Two current
full-contact champions.

<i>Each man gets
10 million euro-credits</i>

<i>if they can defeat our champion.</i>

Oh, my God!

As you can see,
he's not the same fighter or man

<i>he was six months ago.</i>

I don't think the word "man"
even applies.

<i>Isn't there a rule
that fighters must be at least</i>

90% human?

<i>This is our tournament
on our private island</i>

<i>outside the jurisdiction
of any country.</i>

We'll increase the allowance
of cyber implants to 50%.

<i>After all,
the reason for the tournament</i>

is to demonstrate
the superiority

of biomechanical systems
over human tissue, right?

Right.

Now what if a pure human
wants to compete?

The tournament is
completely open to all,

even pure humans.
Even the American.

Chance o'brien is considered
the greatest champion ever.

It is our intention

to have him compete
in the tournament.

But can xao beat him?

We'll make sure he does.

We will let you take this step,
Mr. tung.

But remember,
xao's fate and yours

are one and the same.

<i>Oh, my!
We've got another great fight.</i>

<i>The world's number-one
ranked challenger</i>

<i>is giving the champion,</i>

<i>chance o'brien,
all he can handle.</i>

<i>Raul comes to this fight
with an impressive</i>

<i>29 and 1 record,</i>

<i>the lone loss coming early
in his career</i>

<i>before he had
his cyber implants.</i>

<i>O'brien has seemed
sluggish so far.</i>

<i>His mind doesn't seem
focused on the fight.</i>

<i>His showboating and sluggish
performance thus far</i>

<i>has not pleased his manager, Jo.</i>

<i>Raul could build up
enough points</i>

<i>in the computer scoring
that could endanger</i>

<i>o'brien's hold on
the world title</i>

<i>he has held for three years.</i>

<i>Oh, boy! There's a little
of o'brien's power.</i>

Stop fooling around!

<i>But Raul comes right back!</i>

<i>And there's the bell
ending the round.</i>

What the hell
are you doing out there?

That ought to have a tag
on his toe by now.

Hey, you want to give it a try?
Knock it off!

You're defending your title.

Now get out there
and fight like it.

Will you marry me?
What?

Will you marry me?

You're asking me now?

Yeah. I mean, we can stay here.

I tell you what, champ.

I'll marry
whoever wins this bout.

<i>There seems to be a heated</i>

<i>discussion
in the champion's corner.</i>

<i>Jo has got to have told o'brien</i>

<i>that he is on the verge
of losing his title.</i>

<i>Let's see if it's had any effect</i>

<i>on o'brien's coming out strong.</i>

<i>He's going
right to a flying kick!</i>

<i>Raul's going down!</i>

<i>The real champ o'brien
seems to have shown up.</i>

Yeah!

Hey, Raul,

you know who Jo is, don't you?

Yeah, your trainer?

Yeah, she's right over there.

Why don't you take a look?
What?

Go ahead, take a look.
I'm not going to hit you.

<i>Wait, o'brien
and Raul seem to be</i>

<i>having some kind of discussion</i>

<i>out in the middle of the ring.</i>

What in the hell?

Sweet girl.

Well, she said she'll marry
whoever wins this.

Really?

Maybe I'd better go rent a tux.

<i>The conversation seems directed</i>

<i>- at o'brien's manager, Jo.</i>
What's going on?

<i>I can't quite hear
what they're saying.</i>

<i>But here we go.</i>

<i>The fighters seem
ready to fight again.</i>

Honeymoon in Hawaii?

Yeah, how about a cold
day in hell?

Really?

Okay, come on!

Come on, chance!

Yeah! There you go, baby!

<i>Oh, golly! What a kick!</i>

<i>That's lights out for Raul.</i>

<i>Chance o'brien successfully</i>

<i>defends his championship
for the eleventh time.</i>

<i>He has staked his claim</i>

<i>as the greatest fighter
in the world today.</i>

All right, baby!

Chance! Chance!

Who do you fight next?

Actually, my next
fight is with my trainer

here about where we're
going on our honeymoon.

A fight against
the heavyweight champion

astasio would be fantastic.

Not for astasio.

What about the tournament

held by the sianon corporation?

What about it?

Well, as the greatest

human fighter in the world,

do you intend to
test your fighting skills

against the world's
foremost cyborgs?

Mr. o'brien is not interested

in proving himself
to a bunch of robots

<i>and used car parts.</i>

Xao will be competing.
You owe him a rematch.

Or are you afraid that your win

was just human luck?

I'll tell you what, Mr...

You know my name. Tung.

Tung.

If you give me the 60 million

you're offering in platinum,

I'll show you some luck.

It's yours, if you earn it.

We're not interested.

Chance o'brien is
a legitimate world champion.

He doesn't have to fight
in your bloodfest.

So Mr. o'brien is afraid of xao.

<i>Not afraid.</i>

He'd rip his implants off

and shove them up
his synthetic ass.

Like she says,
we're not interested.

It's getting late,
and if anyone doesn't have

an intelligent question,
we'll call it a night.

Thanks a lot, everyone.

Sorry if these clowns
ruined it for you.

I expect you all to be there.

So now that you're not in
such a weakened state,

still want to marry me?

Honey, when you're around,

I'm always in a weakened state.

I'm serious.
So am I.

Well, if you put it that way,

how can I say no?

Well, you could try.

But I'm tougher than you are.

Come on, Mrs. o'brien,
I'll buy you some breakfast.

Sounds great.

Ah, I love Rome.
It's so romantic.

It's like an old
movie or something.

Let's get married
here in the spring.

It would be great to do it

with 60 mill in platinum.

We don't need the money.

You know he's jacked up more.

It's past the limit, but I
bet I could still beat him.

I'm not going to let you go.

Why?

Jo, if I win this, I never
have to fight again.

If you lose, I'll never have

a chance to say I do.

You think I can't win.

No.

It's not about winning, chance.

It's not even about competition.

It's sales and
market shares and profits.

It's not you or me.

What?

I love you.

<i>- You have no idea.</i>
No.

I'm going to prove it to you.

With this ring, I thee wed.

And with this whistle,
I thee wed.

Hey!

You're so good.

<i>Looks like my clowns spoiled</i>

your fun again, huh?

Come on.

You should have
accepted our invitation.

The publicity would have been
great for both of us.

Well, since you
won't do it for money,

<i>maybe you'll do it for love.</i>

<i>See you at the fights,
Mr. o'brienski.</i>

Mr. o'brien, the world champion.

We've been expecting you.

I'm a big fan of yours myself.

Where is this tournament
being held?

Iridoken island,
and you're scheduled

to register tomorrow.
Thanks.

We're going to break
this boy down.

You shouldn't be here
by yourself.

Lots of bad people here.

Hey, look, I need
to take these shoes.

I promise I'll come back
and I'll pay you later.

I promise. I promise.

Anybody knows
where the docks are?

The docks.

Hey, does anyone know
where the docks are?

Does anybody know
where the boats come in?

Huh?

Hey! Hey!

Do you guys know
where the docks are?

The docks.
Docks?

The docks! The docks,
where the boats come in.

Ah, docks.

Yeah.

Over there.
That way.

<i>- That way.</i>
No, no. That way.

Whoa!

Hey! What the hell
is wrong with you?

Hey, wait up!

Hey, wait!

Hey! Hey!

<i>Cover your human ass, man!</i>

Chance o'brien.

No, that's okay.

I don't want to know somebody

I might have to kill.

Lance stovich.

Country?
Armenia.

Put your hand over there.

Step over there.

On the line.

<i>49.7% cybergenics, approved.</i>

Over there.

Name?

Chance o'brien.

Country?

United States.

Company?

Put your hand over there.

<i>Okay, step over there.</i>

On the line.

Percentage of
cyber implants, zero.

<i>- Name?</i>
Bradford wharton,

the zanik corporation.

You may as well go home now.

Country?
Usa.

You don't have a chance.

Put your hand over there.

Hey, champ,
save it for the ring.

Okay, step over there.

Go home!

Name?
My name? Chung.

<i>Percentage of
molecular mutations--</i>

Step over there.

Thank you.

How do you like those
synthetic heatseekers?

Hey, sorry about the car.

Forget it.

You always go
jogging in the nude?

I was mugged.

<i>You're from
the zanik corporation.</i>

It's big-time bio shit, huh?

Yeah, 13th largest.

I can honestly say they made me

<i>the man I am today.</i>

I get three million just
to show up and show off.

Who's sponsoring you?

The bad guys.

<i>- Huh?
Forget it.</i>

So you see any of the
sianon corporation around?

<i>Not yet. Hey, you hungry?</i>

<i>I've got this great corporate
expense account.</i>

Come on, let's go
get something to eat.

Come on.

Hey, thanks for that.

<i>A word from
the sianon corporation.</i>

<i>Are you tired of looking like</i>

<i>a 98-pound weakling
but are too lazy</i>

<i>to do anything about it?</i>

<i>Well, welcome to sianon's
21st-century miracle.</i>

<i>No diets and no workouts.</i>

<i>The sianon corporation's</i>

<i>new cyber implants
will have you looking</i>

<i>the way you want.</i>

<i>You can do it
quickly and safely,</i>

<i>with just some minor discomfort.</i>

<i>In just three days' time,</i>

<i>sianon guarantees
to give you the body</i>

<i>and face you've always wanted,</i>

<i>rebuilt with cyber-enhanced</i>

<i>implants into
a more powerful you.</i>

<i>So do you really
want to look like this</i>

<i>when in three days
you could look like this?</i>

<i>A safer, better-looking
cyber future</i>

<i>from the sianon corporation.</i>

You know where xao is staying?

That's top secret.

All the corporations
have taken a lot

of security to protect
their products

from any tampering.
Oh, yeah?

Well, where is
all your security?

You're looking at
the chairman of the board.

I can do what I want.

For all the money we were
going to spend on a fighter,

I just figured I'd do it myself.

Yeah, well, you may find
the ring a little tougher

than the boardroom.

I was pro before
I went corporate.

I can handle it.

Don't tell me your family--

Yeah, dear old dad.

Well, at least you had a choice.

Is someone forcing
you to be here?

Sianon.

Now, Ms. Tobin,
if you promise to be good,

<i>I'll have your chip deactivated.</i>

<i>Okay?</i>

There.

Fuck you, asshole!

<i>Bad, bad girl!</i>

Boy, you have
a lot of fight in you.

It's too bad you're not a man.

<i>Now, one more time, be good,</i>

and the chip is deactivated.

Okay? Simple, there.

You're not being good.

All right.

All right?

You went through
a lot of trouble,

didn't you, to get chance to
enter this two-bit tournament?

Well, it turns out
that the majority

of the public didn't consider it

a true world championship

without the participation
of a real champion,

so we convinced every champion

of every style to,
shall we say, enlist.

That's a lot of kidnapping.

<i>Fortunately, they were not</i>

<i>immune to cash inducements.</i>

<i>Only one champion
resisted all our efforts.</i>

Integrity is a drag.

Believe me, this was not the way

we wanted to do it.

So what happens now, hmm?

<i>What, are you going to kill me?</i>

<i>Is that it?</i>

Oh, unless chance
does his fight with xao?

We don't believe
Mr. o'brien has a...

How do you Americans say it?

A snowball's chance in hell?

What do you want with me?

We want you to train xao.

Why would I do
something like that?

Because if you don't,

Mr. o'brien's survival chances

<i>won't be very promising.</i>

<i>We'll reward you handsomely.</i>

Fuck you and your money!
Ouch!

Before you
finalize the decision,

and in effect doom
Mr. o'brien's life,

please allow me
to show you something.

He doesn't need a trainer,

he needs a goddamn leash.

He's impressive, isn't he?

Yeah, but he has no heart.

He never has.

That's why chance beat him.

Yeah, unfortunately
you're right.

But we're hoping
that your training

will give him what his
poor upbringing took away.

I won't train him.

Actually, we would like you

to show him a certain
amount of...

Yes, love, if you will.

What the hell are
you talking about?

Your attention will give him

the confidence
he needs to... to win.

Look what it did for o'brien.

You want me to fuck
him, don't you?

No.

No.

Don't you get it?

He needs love! Love!

I want you to love him.

That's what he needs.

<i>This place is a little small.</i>

This is nothing.

I've got someone here
who can help you

<i>find out where
is xao is staying.</i>

<i>Appreciate it.</i>

<i>This tournament,</i>

<i>the sianon corporation's
own representative, xao.</i>

<i>I'll do what I can to help.</i>

But you come up against me

in this tournament
and I'll crush you.

You help me find xao
and the tournament's yours.

Nice toys you have here.

You can't be too prepared.

<i>Liu, we need to help
Mr. o'brien find out</i>

<i>where xao's training camp is.</i>

Most of the corporate sites

are using electronic cloaking.

It's not going to be easy.

I thought you might
as well relax a while.

It's going to take some time.

What are you doing here?

Just thought I'd come
and give you some pointers.

I have coaches, you know.

I know.

You know, you should

switch your balance to the left.

Why don't you go back

to chance o'brien
where you belong?

It's over between us.

That's not what it
looked like the last time

I saw the two of you together.

Things change.

Bullshit!

You know, I could
have left here.

Oh? So what are you
doing here, then?

I'm here for you.

<i>Welcome to day one
of the tournament.</i>

<i>56 cyber corporations</i>

<i>are represented
here by the greatest</i>

<i>fighters of all time.</i>

<i>Every one of them
is a current or former</i>

<i>world champion,
and some, like xao</i>

<i>of the sianon corporation,</i>

<i>are undeclared weapons.</i>

<i>This tournament isn't just about</i>

<i>who the best fighter is,
but also about</i>

<i>who has the best cyber
implant system.</i>

<i>It's an exciting challenge</i>

<i>for the world's
cyber corporations.</i>

<i>For the first time,
fighters will be</i>

<i>allowed to be cybered up to 50%</i>

<i>of their total mass.</i>

<i>The opening of the tournament</i>

<i>will be handled by tung,
the head of marketing</i>

<i>for the sponsoring
sianon corporation.</i>

Welcome to
the sianon tournament.

<i>Good luck to you.</i>

<i>Here we go with
the first round of action.</i>

Fighters!

<i>The first fighter is bodo,</i>

<i>representing the du canne
cyber corporation of France.</i>

<i>His opponent is ikila,</i>

<i>representing the siwa cybertron</i>

<i>corporation of Bombay.</i>

<i>Bodo fights in the world
cybertronic association.</i>

<i>His style is a mutant version</i>

<i>of outlaw shootfighting.</i>

<i>He is the current world champion</i>

<i>in his weight and
implant classification.</i>

<i>His record is 67 wins,
no losses,</i>

<i>and he has sent four men</i>

<i>to their deaths in the ring.</i>

<i>Ikila is a generation
one cyber fighter.</i>

<i>Siwa is a new corporation
trying to get started.</i>

<i>They're hoping, with an
impressive showing here,</i>

<i>their stock prices will rise,</i>

<i>giving them the capital
they need to play</i>

<i>with the larger corporations</i>

<i>such as sianon and du canne.</i>

<i>Well, it's an
apparent right off,</i>

<i>bodo's superior cyber implants</i>

<i>are going to win out.</i>

<i>He's beginning to dominate here</i>

<i>with his super-charged
speed and strength.</i>

<i>Bodo's just toying
with ikila now.</i>

<i>A quick look at the stock market</i>

<i>shows ikila's corporation</i>

<i>is starting to lose stock value.</i>

<i>And that's the end.</i>

<i>Bodo wins with a time of 3:16.</i>

<i>Bodo is one of the favorites
to reach the finals.</i>

<i>Bodo's sponsor, du canne,</i>

<i>has seen their stock prices
rise dramatically...</i>

<i>Representing
the nubicon corporation</i>

<i>of khartoum is tal Aziz.</i>

<i>The ferocious nubian
has a record</i>

<i>of 81 wins and no losses.</i>

<i>Tal Aziz has actually come out</i>

<i>of retirement for this fight.</i>

<i>Jolly, tal Aziz's
opponent, represents</i>

<i>the tokao corporation
of Singapore.</i>

<i>Their fighter is a journeyman</i>

<i>in the world cyber circuit
and comes here</i>

<i>with a 47 win,
three loss record.</i>

<i>Jolly uses the tiger style,
but tal Aziz is clearly</i>

<i>the superior fighter here.</i>

<i>His implants appear to
give him a huge advantage.</i>

<i>Jolly has proven
first generation</i>

<i>cyber technology just
isn't up to this competition.</i>

<i>Oh, my! The
nubicon corporation stock</i>

<i>has risen by 16 points!</i>

<i>The tokao corporation stock,</i>

<i>by contrast, has just collapsed.</i>

<i>The next challenger is
the highly regarded sante.</i>

<i>Sante is a fluid
monkey chi stylist.</i>

<i>Chung is the current world cyber</i>

<i>all-around champion.
His sponsor, kalbag,</i>

<i>is the second largest cyber
corporation in the world,</i>

<i>and their market share</i>

<i>has risen to the point
where they now</i>

<i>challenge sianon's
number one position.</i>

<i>Oh, my! Chung
delivers a kill blow!</i>

<i>That makes it 29
kills for chung!</i>

I've located xao's whereabouts.

Well, let's go.

You're still leading
with your left

and you're leaving
your right side open.

<i>He's not showing
much improvement.</i>

I'm doing the best I can.

All right, I think it is time
we had another little talk.

What do you want?

Haven't I done
a good enough job?

I just want a little
cooperation, that's all.

Okay, xao is definitely in here.

<i>So is tung.</i>

<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

<i>Look, are you
sure about this? Huh?</i>

<i>They catch you,
this is their island,</i>

<i>their laws, and they can make
you disappear forever.</i>

<i>They asked me to fight,</i>

<i>and I'm fighting, all right?
I got to get in there.</i>

Wait! Wait!

A gift from liu.

Good luck.

Mr. o'brien, we are
within our rights

to execute you for trespassing.

<i>You know,</i>

since you did
enter the tournament,

we of course
offered to set Jo free,

<i>but imagine our surprise
when she refused to go.</i>

<i>Life.</i>

Life is truly a series of
unexpected turns.

What have you done with her?

Nothing... yet.

Looks like you're
going to make it.

What the hell happened?

My people found
you on the street.

Looks like I got a little more
than I bargained for.

Yeah, well, I hope
it was worth the effort.

You're supposed
to fight this morning.

I don't think you're
going to make it.

That's just what
tung is expecting.

Whatever you say, champ.

It's your funeral.

How's it feel?

O'brien, you're up.

Good luck.

<i>It's a surprise to see</i>

<i>chance o'brien here
in this tournament.</i>

<i>His disdain for cyber-enhanced
fighters is well known,</i>

<i>and he has continually
told the press</i>

<i>that he would not compete
here in this tournament.</i>

<i>Well, something
must have changed.</i>

<i>Mr. o'brien's mind.</i>

<i>Could it be the
60 million first prize?</i>

<i>O'brien, of course,
is considered</i>

<i>the greatest fighter
in the world today.</i>

<i>He has never been defeated</i>

<i>and has continued to
prove his dominance</i>

<i>against all fighters
from all weight categories</i>

<i>from all styles.</i>

<i>One thing that could
have caused his</i>

<i>change of heart is
the loss of his manager,</i>

<i>Jo, who is in xao's
sianon training camp.</i>

<i>Perhaps he's here
for a little revenge.</i>

<i>But skill or no skill,</i>

<i>o'brien has got a tough
road ahead of him.</i>

<i>He'll be facing
the most jacked-up</i>

<i>and powerful fighters
he has ever faced.</i>

<i>O'brien's opponent is Arturo.</i>

<i>Arturo represents
a mid-sized corporation,</i>

<i>which operates
out of Mexico city.</i>

<i>Arturo's record is an impressive</i>

<i>54 wins and no losses.</i>

<i>Arturo fights in nirvana style.</i>

<i>O'brien seems driven here.</i>

<i>I don't think I've ever
seen him so pumped up.</i>

<i>He seems to be punishing
his opponent.</i>

<i>Well, there it is.</i>

<i>O'brien advances, but you have</i>

<i>to wonder if the loss
of his trainer</i>

<i>won't hamper his
chances down the road.</i>

<i>This is an interesting match-up.</i>

<i>Earl is a grappling
stylist from Ghana.</i>

<i>He represents the hassa
corporation of Liberia</i>

<i>with a record of
38 wins and one loss.</i>

<i>He has killed 13
men in the ring.</i>

<i>His opponent, bokandu,
is a Kali stylist</i>

<i>from the tokay corporation
based in Jakarta.</i>

<i>Bokandu is an outlaw fighter</i>

<i>who has recently been
in prison for murder.</i>

<i>The tokay corporation
got him out</i>

<i>just for this event.</i>

<i>Bokandu is confused by
Earl's grappling action.</i>

<i>It seems only a matter of time</i>

<i>before Earl can put his infamous</i>

<i>neck-breaker on bokandu.</i>

<i>There it is, the neck-breaker!</i>

<i>And it's over.</i>

<i>Earl wins, bokandu has expired.</i>

<i>Mario represents</i>

<i>the zikan corporation of Brazil.</i>

<i>His style is that
of a kendo-crane mix</i>

<i>with the strength
of the cyber-speed implants</i>

<i>developed by
the zikan corporation.</i>

<i>His opponent is lito.</i>

<i>Lito is a rising star
in the Asian circuit</i>

<i>and he was recruited by
the genpact corporation</i>

<i>to be the recipient of their
new alto technology.</i>

<i>Well, it's back
to the drawing board</i>

<i>for the genpact corporation.</i>

<i>Mario wins and advances.</i>

Chance! Chance!

If I don't win this tournament,

the company is finished.

Isn't there some way
you can turn it around?

I made some bad
deals along the way,

some of them illegal.

My dad took the fall for me.

I can't turn that around.

Come on, let's finish our run.

Fight!

Yeah!

<i>Final bout
of the quarter-finals.</i>

<i>It's bodo of the
du canne corporation</i>

<i>versus chance o'brien,</i>

<i>the only 100% human
fighter in the tournament.</i>

<i>O'brien has a formidable
opponent in front of him</i>

<i>as bodo has killed his</i>

<i>last three
challengers in the ring.</i>

<i>Both stylists have
speed and power.</i>

<i>The edge has to go bodo
with all his cyber implants.</i>

<i>Rumors abound
that bodo has secretly</i>

<i>jacked up closer
to the 60% level</i>

<i>by disguising his
microbiotic implants</i>

<i>in live human tissue.</i>

<i>Implants or not,
bodo doesn't seem to be</i>

<i>able to stop o'brien's attacks.</i>

<i>Everything bodo
tries is swept aside</i>

<i>and answered by
o'brien's relentless assault.</i>

<i>What a kick from o'brien!</i>

<i>Bodo's neck, which
is listed as human,</i>

<i>reveals cybergenic implants.</i>

<i>Bodo cheated, but to no avail.</i>

<i>O'brien advances.</i>

Of course, for me, there is
no serious competition here.

I definitely cannot
foresee any competition,

and as for chance o'brien,

the last time was purely luck.

I'm in the greatest
shape of my life

thanks to my new trainer.

Hey! Hey! Hey!

<i>Are you training xao now?</i>

<i>What happened to
you and chance o'brien?</i>

She decided to back a winner.

What are you doing,
Jo, huh? What are you doing?

Save it for the ring, o'brien.

You're going to need it.

What I'm going to need is
a broom to sweep up

after what's left of you
and your fucking tin man.

If that's the best he can do,

we have nothing to worry about.

Jo!

Jo!

Ha! Looks like you've got
a weak spot after all.

Ow! Stop.

Hmm, hmm, hmm.

Not yet. Are you ready?

You mean when you're ready.

<i>Bradford is well known
as the fighting chairman</i>

<i>of the board of
the zanik toma corporation.</i>

Fighters, start!

<i>Rumors have been circulating</i>

<i>that zanik toma is
close to bankruptcy,</i>

<i>but Bradford's appearance
here shows they are</i>

<i>not willing to go down
without a fight.</i>

<i>Bradford has been retired
the last three years</i>

<i>as he concentrated
on zanik toma,</i>

<i>a company his father built</i>

<i>into the fourth-leading</i>

<i>cyber corporation in the world.</i>

<i>Tragically, Bradford's father--</i>

You're going down. I'm gonna
finish you, pretty boy.

<i>And the company has been heading</i>

<i>downward ever since.</i>

<i>We'll have to see if
Bradford can come back</i>

<i>from his retirement</i>

<i>and save the future
of his company.</i>

Start!

<i>Bradford's opponent is mouche,</i>

<i>Uganda stylist from
the cyberlogic corporation.</i>

Yeah! Ha!

<i>Bradford's skills
are still there!</i>

<i>He devastates mouche!
Bradford advances.</i>

Whoo!

Hey, man. Good luck.

I know. I know I deserve it.

Xao is up.

Xao<i> enters the ring</i>
<i>after a one-year layoff.</i>

<i>After losing to o'brien
in last year's</i>

<i>heavyweight championship,</i>

<i>xao was hired by
the sianon corporation.</i>

<i>The end result of
that partnership</i>

<i>will be seen tonight,</i>

<i>as this will be
xao's first fight</i>

<i>with his new
state-of-the-art implants.</i>

<i>Obviously sianon
is expecting xao</i>

<i>to make an impressive
impact here</i>

<i>in the tournament.</i>

<i>Xao has coasted
through the other rounds</i>

<i>as opponents have defaulted</i>

<i>or have been
injured in training.</i>

<i>Xao's opponent here is tal Aziz,</i>

<i>the nubian from
the nubicon corporation.</i>

<i>Both companies' market shares</i>

<i>and reputations are on the line.</i>

<i>Fight!</i>

<i>And here we go.</i>

<i>What a battle this
should be with xao,</i>

<i>a disciple of
the wing chun school,</i>

<i>and tal Aziz, a nuba stylist.</i>

<i>Oh, my! Xao is incredible.</i>

<i>His speed and power
are going to be</i>

<i>too much for the nubian.</i>

Christ, he makes me think twice
about fighting him.

<i>I think tal Aziz knows
he's in trouble here.</i>

<i>What a horrifying glimpse</i>

<i>into the future of
cyber-fighting.</i>

<i>Xao is a virtual
superhuman killing machine.</i>

<i>Nothing in this tournament
is likely to stop him.</i>

<i>For the three corporations</i>

<i>remaining in the tournament,</i>

<i>trillions of dollars
are on the line.</i>

<i>With so much at stake,</i>

<i>tomorrow's bouts promise to be</i>

<i>the greatest
battles of all time.</i>

<i>Be there.</i>

I want a guarantee that
chance won't get hurt.

How can I do that, Jo?

I've only agreed
not to kill him.

What control do I have if he

continues fighting
in the tournament?

Disqualify him or something.

It's your tournament.
It's your island.

I'm sure you can
figure out a way.

That would arouse suspicion, Jo.

And I agree with you,

it's a surprise Mr. o'brien

has made it to the semi-finals,

but now if something
were to happen,

the outcome would be
devastating to the tournament.

Please. I've done all you asked.

And more.

I don't want chance
to fight xao.

Xao will kill him.

Oh, put your mind at ease, Jo.

I think it's very
unlikely Mr. o'brien

will reach a bout with xao.

His opponent tomorrow
is formidable.

Yeah, Mr. o'brien's
heroic march will end.

I'm sure of it.
Thank you.

Thank you? For what?

Hey! Hey!

Mr. tung would like to see you.

Just take a minute.

<i>Hey! What are you doing?</i>

<i>Just relax! Relax.</i>

<i>Hey, listen.</i>

There you go, sir.

What the fuck is going on?

We are not to be seen together.

I watched you today, Bradford.

I don't know, you were
quite helpful to o'brien.

I can't just do nothing.

You told me to befriend him--

But I didn't say
make him a winner.

Xao is a bit nervous
about o'brien, you see.

They have this history.

Look, chance is good,

but he's not all together.

You've seen to that.

And he won't get any
cyber enhancements

to overcome his injuries.

I don't think xao should worry.

My thoughts exactly,
but xao would like

to see him further handicapped,

and I'm inclined to agree
since there's no sense

of risking any
possibility of defeat.

What do you have in mind?

During your match tomorrow,
injure him seriously.

Easier said than done.

Figure out a way, Bradford.

I'm still supposed
to lose to him--

Yes. Yes.

A match between xao and o'brien

is what we've
worked for, is it not?

That's what you've worked for.

Me, I expect you to
buy me out of my stocks.

Loan the toma corporation

the two trillion dollars
you promised

and get my father out of prison.

The moment you injure o'brien

and lose to him,
the deal is closed.

If you screw me in any way--

You'll do what, Bradford?

You'll do what?

<i>I don't think your father</i>

<i>would appreciate
any foolish acts.</i>

Jail can be a dangerous place.

Things can happen.

He's looking good, isn't he?

<i>Now we're down to our
last four competitors,</i>

<i>and what a group they are.</i>

<i>The greatest fighters
in the world today.</i>

<i>Xao has brutally destroyed</i>

<i>every opponent
he has faced so far.</i>

<i>All three have been killed,</i>

<i>and with frightening ease.</i>

<i>Sianon has certainly done</i>

<i>a remarkable job with
xao's cyber implants.</i>

<i>They seem to be
far ahead of all the others.</i>

<i>Xao's opponent, chung, has also</i>

<i>cruised through his matches.</i>

<i>He is three for three in kills,</i>

<i>but there are big questions
for chung in this match.</i>

<i>Can his ruthless killer instinct</i>

<i>and speed offset xao's
extraordinary power</i>

<i>and relentless attack?</i>

You're just a fucking tin man!

<i>I think he knows he's in
for the fight of his life.</i>

<i>Xao's attack
appears unstoppable.</i>

<i>Chung can't seem
to find the answer.</i>

<i>Oh, my!</i>

<i>I've never seen anyone
do this to chung!</i>

<i>Xao is handling him
with such ease,</i>

<i>it's mind-boggling.</i>

<i>Xao is toying with chung,</i>

<i>punishing him.</i>

<i>He's literally tearing</i>

<i>the flesh off
chung's cybergenics.</i>

<i>That's it!</i>

<i>Another impressive kill for xao.</i>

<i>He moves into the
championship tomorrow,</i>

<i>and as I check the sianon stock,</i>

<i>it is going through the roof.</i>

<i>Success in the
market and the fact</i>

<i>that this tournament
has become the most</i>

<i>widely watched event in history</i>

<i>has to have the sianon
people ecstatic.</i>

<i>Stepping into the ring,</i>

<i>world champion chance o'brien.</i>

<i>And here comes his opponent,</i>

<i>Bradford wharton of
the zanik toma corporation.</i>

<i>The winner of this fight
advances into tomorrow's</i>

<i>championship bout
against xao of sianon.</i>

<i>We've observed
o'brien and wharton</i>

<i>training together all week,</i>

<i>and I'm sure all bets
and friendships</i>

<i>here are off in this
semi-final bout.</i>

<i>Both men have a tremendous
amount at stake.</i>

<i>O'brien, using a kickboxing
tae Kwon do style</i>

<i>punched up to
power shootfighting,</i>

<i>while wharton favors a smoother,</i>

<i>softer aikido tamata style.</i>

<i>Wharton is the matador,
o'brien the bull.</i>

<i>Wharton the flashy showman,</i>

<i>o'brien the blue collar warrior.</i>

<i>Oh, my! O'brien's hurt.</i>

<i>He's down! This could be over.</i>

<i>All wharton needs to do</i>

<i>is move in and finish o'brien.</i>

<i>But wharton seems to be
more preoccupied</i>

<i>with playing to the crowd.</i>

<i>This could be a giant mistake</i>

<i>that wharton may regret.</i>

<i>O'brien is up. Wharton has
missed a chance</i>

<i>for a quick end to this fight.</i>

<i>O'brien is coming on strong.
He seems fully recovered.</i>

<i>Oh, my! Wharton goes down
and he's out.</i>

<i>O'brien wins! O'brien wins!</i>

<i>Who would have thought a 100%</i>

<i>human could come this far?</i>

Chance! Chance!

Now the world will see
who the real champion is.

<i>So o'brien advances in a shocker</i>

<i>to the championship
match against xao.</i>

Next time you won't be so lucky.

You had a shot.
Why didn't you take it?

Ah, you beat me fair and square.

That's all there is to it.

Someone put acid in my gloves.

You son of a bitch!

You promised me chance
wouldn't fight xao.

No, I said it was
highly unlikely--

Well, forget it.
The deal is off.

I'm telling xao what's going on.

You wanted to see me?
Yeah, come here.

I've looked for Jo everywhere.

Have you seen her?

As a matter of fact, I have.

<i>Look.</i>

Hurt me and Jo dies.

You get to kill
chance o'brien tomorrow.

That's not such
a bad thing, is it?

Don't say anything.

I have to.

Leave him.

You have an
important fight tomorrow.

Just concentrate on that.

Looks like I fucked up again.

What the hell? What's going on?

It's tung.

He threatened to kill my father

if I didn't help him.

Tung promised xao
he could have Jo...

He could have Jo if he beat you.

I want to see Jo.
She's safe for now.

You lose to xao today,
you get her back.

<i>Put up a good fight,</i>

the best you've
ever done, but lose.

And if I don't think much
of the fight you put up...

Jo dies.

Do we understand each other?

So what is it now, Mr. tung?

Gentlemen, tomorrow

the sianon corporation
will be crowned the greatest

bioengineering company
in the world.

But how can you
guarantee success?

How can you be sure xao will not

lose heart and match?

Well, it's true there
are many variables

in the sporting match.

Even with all his perfection,

<i>there are weaknesses.</i>

And how do you overcome that?

The only true advantage
the American has over us...

Is his emotional commitment.

We will give xao his own.

Mr. tung, if you fuck this up,

I will have you gutted.

Do you understand my meaning?

<i>What a match-up
for the championship.</i>

<i>Sianon couldn't have hoped</i>

<i>for a better ending to
this incredible tournament.</i>

<i>Xao, the sianon representative,</i>

<i>has clearly established</i>

<i>the superiority of
the sianon product line.</i>

<i>Here comes xao.</i>

<i>He is accompanied
by the head of marketing</i>

<i>for sianon, tung.
Also in xao's party,</i>

<i>o'brien's ex-manager, Jo Tobin.</i>

<i>And now this is a surprise, liu,</i>

<i>Bradford wharton's assistant.</i>

<i>It seems everyone is
shifting over</i>

<i>to what is appearing
to be the winning team.</i>

<i>Xao's transformation
from a good fighter</i>

<i>to a competitor of this caliber</i>

<i>is truly extraordinary.</i>

<i>And for it all to come down</i>

<i>to beating chance o'brien,</i>

<i>the reigning world champion,</i>

<i>the fighter considered</i>

<i>one of the greatest of all time</i>

<i>and the only 100% pure
human in the tournament.</i>

<i>What a story this has become.</i>

Chance! Chance!

<i>The last time these two men met</i>

<i>has no bearing on this
because xao</i>

<i>just isn't the same fighter
he was back then.</i>

Don't make me use
the remote, Mr. o'brien.

Don't forget.

<i>It seems some words
are being exchanged,</i>

<i>but the fighters move out
to the center of the ring.</i>

<i>There is no love lost
between these two,</i>

<i>certainly not for the defection</i>

<i>of o'brien's manager
to xao's camp.</i>

<i>This shapes up as
a fight with many aspects.</i>

<i>It's cyber versus human,</i>

<i>traditional kung fu against
high-tech shootfighting,</i>

<i>and the past versus the future.</i>

<i>And we're just about
ready to get underway.</i>

Fight!

<i>Here we go.
There's no holding back.</i>

<i>Both fighters are unloading
right from the top.</i>

<i>Can they keep this up?</i>

<i>Both men are
attacking relentlessly,</i>

<i>trying to destroy one another
as quickly as possible.</i>

<i>There seems to be
something going on</i>

<i>between o'brien and tung.</i>

<i>Oh, my! O'brien is
destroying xao.</i>

<i>He is using his
famous sudden strike</i>

<i>to rip xao's cybergenics apart.</i>

<i>Damn, liu has pulled a gun!</i>

<i>I don't know what this means!</i>

<i>Oh, my! Xao is down.</i>

<i>Incredible!</i>

<i>We'll have to see
how xao deals with this.</i>

<i>Sianon has to be concerned here.</i>

<i>It seems impossible,
but xao is down again.</i>

<i>Tung is stepping
out into the ring.</i>

<i>He's got his gun on o'brien!</i>

<i>Here comes xao.</i>

<i>O'brien is on tung
and knocks out tung.</i>

<i>Christ! Xao has been shot!</i>

<i>Jo is struggling with liu.</i>

<i>Oh, my! What is going on?</i>

<i>This is turning out to be
a disaster for sianon.</i>

Chance! Chance!
