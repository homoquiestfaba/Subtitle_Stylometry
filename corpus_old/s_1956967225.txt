â™ª â™ª

Michael, you look terrible.

Have you lost weight?

No, Syd, the guys and I order out
for burgers and beer every night.

What do you think?

I was just expressing
my concern.

I mean, no one understands what

you're going through better
than me, Michael.

I know what it's like to be accused
of a crime you didn't commit,

be locked up
with sadistic criminals,

feel like all your friends
have deserted you.

I just wish I could help.

You can, and you will,
because you owe me, Syd.

I don't owe you
anything, Michael.

Well, I better be going.

I've got shopping to do today,

thought maybe I'd catch a movie,

maybe go out to lunch.

It's a beautiful day in LA.

Syd, please, no, come on, wait.

You've got to help me.

Maybe I can stay for a minute.

Okay.

Now, look, Kimberly's
behind all this.

She set me up.

I need you to find out
what she's up to.

I don't know, Michael,
I'm pretty busy.

Hey, don't forget,
Kimberly set you up, too.

Hung you out to dry, remember?

This could be the perfect
opportunity to get her back.

In a perfect world, Michael,

you'd both be behind bars.

Look, Syd, the truth is that...

you're the only one
I could ever count on.

You're the only person
in this world

I could ever trust.

My only friend.

So, please.

Help me get out of here.

I'll see what I can find out.

Oh, and, Michael, here's a tip:

Keep your back to the wall.

Good morning.

Brooke, ah, what a surprise.

Hi, Billy. Mr. Armstrong.

So, are you two playing
tennis this morning?

No, we're not.

Brooke and I got
engaged last night.

Isn't it wonderful, Dad?

Wonderful hardly covers it.

Well, I just want you to know

that I love your
daughter very much,

and I will do everything in
my power to make her happy.

Yeah, well, that's
a tall order, Billy.

But from everything that
Brooke has told me about you,

I'm sure that won't be
a problem.

Congratulations.

Thank you. That's great.

Welcome to the family, Billy.

Thank you.

So what are your plans?

Have you two set a date yet?

Well, we were thinking
about this Saturday.

Saturday?

Well, sweetie,
you just got engaged.

What's the rush?

We're not rushing.

There's just no need to wait.

Well, you're not giving
your old man much time.

But if you want to get
married this weekend,

I will move heaven and earth
to make it happen.

Thank you. Appreciate it.

Mmm, I have the two most
wonderful men in my life.

Thank you.

Billy, could you
give us a minute here?

Yeah, sure, I'll, I'll
wait for you in the car.

Thank you.

Come here, sweetie.

Are you out of your mind?

I thought we had your blessing.

I knew you had the hots for him.

Hell, I'm the one that
helped you get

his little girlfriend
Alison out of the way.

Daddy, you're being crude.

He's a nobody, Brooke.

I raised you to have the
best of everything.

He is the best.

You just don't know him yet.

Billy's like that little company

that you bought in St. Louis.

He's an undervalued asset.

With the right management,

he can be a Fortune
500 company in no time.

People don't change, Brooke.

I love Billy, and that's
not gonna change.

Ever.

â™ª â™ª

We need to talk.

Come on, just look at me.

Look in the mirror.
What do you got to lose?

My sanity.

Is that what you're afraid of?

Kimberly...

you're not losing your mind.

I really am here.

I've always been inside you.

â™ª â™ª

This isn't happening.

But I can't sit back
and do nothing...

while Michael and Amanda

and Sydney keep hurting you.

When are you going
to hurt them back?

I don't want to hurt them.

That is not true.

You've already tried to kill Michael...
twice...

and don't tell me your world
wouldn't be better off

without those two bitches.

No, no, I don't want
to hurt them.

You can't make me hurt them.

Oh, yes, I can.

Ahh!

Take all the aspirin you want.

I'm not going anywhere
until our job is finished.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, I thought I told you I didn't
want you anywhere near this place.

Jake, you're out
of the hospital.

You should have called me,
I'da come and picked you up.

Get out, Jess.

Look, Jake, I know we both
said a lot of things...

No, you look.

This is my bar.

I don't want you working here.

I don't want you drinking here.

I don't want you
in my life, period.

So this is the thanks I get

for keeping this place going

while you're laid up, huh?

For busting my butt for you?

Are you gonna leave
quietly or are you gonna

give me the pleasure of
throwing your ass out?

You know, I leave
now, Jake, that's it.

I don't have a brother.

Works for me.

Pfft. Keys.

You're all alone now, Jake, but,

hell, that's the
way you like it.

It hurts everywhere,
in my stomach, my head.

I've even got chest pains.

I, it must be stress.

It started when Jake got shot,

and then... then
Michael got arrested.

I still can't believe
he assaulted you

and stalked Amanda.

I mean, I'm not saying
you're lying.

I... he was never
violent with me.

Your blood pressure
is a little high.

It must have been awful for you.

Take a deep breath in.

I don't know how you're
holding it together.

I mean, how are
you doing, really?

I've never felt better, really.

Michael's in jail,
where he belongs.

I've made peace with Amanda...

and I hope with you, too.

Sure. I would like
us to be friends again.

Now, I will have to draw some
blood and run a few tests,

but I'm sure that
everything will be fine.

So, where are you
living these days?

I heard Michael kept
the beach house.

What are you waiting for?

I mean, he's rotting away...

This is your chance.

And you're probably
living in some fleabag.

Kill her, Kimberly.

Do it.

Do it.

So where did you say
you were living?

Um, in a motel room a couple
of blocks from the hospital.

How convenient.

I mean, you're close to your...

Do it.

Mall nearby.

And I guess this is a
pretty safe neighborhood,

as far as neighborhoods go.

Do it.

And, if your car broke down...

â™ª â™ª

I'm sorry.

Now make a fist.

And don't worry.

This won't hurt a bit.

Solasco M. Lacava,
89-75, B-positive...

Matt, can I talk to you?

Sure.

Excuse me.

What's up?

I miss you.

Me, too.

I just wanted to let you know

that Carol and I have
declared a truce.

We're gonna meet with a divorce
lawyer this afternoon.

Really?

How are you holding up?

Honestly, it's kind of tough.

Your being around really helps.

I just need to
know that you're gonna

hang in there a little longer.

Well, um...

I'm not going anywhere.

See you later.

We're from the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department.

We've been ordered to
shut down these premises

and seize all assets.

Let's go.

W-what's going on?
Come on, come on.

Wait a minute, these
people work for me!

Are you Jane Mancini? Yes!

Well, you're in
foreclosure, ma'am.

Here's your official notice.

Now if you please, gather
your personal belongings

and vacate the building
immediately.

I don't believe this, I...

I... I've got orders to fill.

I... I can't leave
my sketches behind.

My new fall line.

Please, just give me
a few more days.

I'm sorry, ma'am.

Don't I have any rights?

All you've got,
young lady, is debt.

â™ª â™ª

Now, let's go.

â™ª â™ª

Dinner's ready.

I'm not hungry.

Come on.

I actually bought a cookbook

and made pasta sauce
from scratch.

Yeah, so you eat it.

Look.

Shooters is not
the only game in town.

You can get another job.

Tomorrow, we'll look at the
want ads in the morning, okay?

I'm sorry.

I'm being an ass.

Just seems like the only thing

that's working in my life
at this moment is us.

Mmm.

Where's the pasta?
It smells great.

Okay.

Hey.

Don't answer it,
we're eating, okay?

Well, it could be about
tomorrow's shoot, okay?

One minute.

Hello?

Oh, Jo.

Oh, I'm so glad you're home.

I talked to Billy, he said
things were over between us.

What? Why?

I don't know.

He must have
misunderstood my letter.

I don't know what to do.

Do I call him, do I come home?

Alison, do you want me
to talk to him?

Alison, this is Jess.

Yeah, look, our dinner's
getting cold, okay?

Jo's gonna have
to get back to you.

This is my time with you.

I don't want to share it.

Please?

Uh, Alison, I'll call you
tomorrow, first thing, okay?

And don't leave Hong Kong
until I call you back.

Sure.

Whenever.

Goodbye.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

It's funny how things
work out, isn't it?

You're on that side
of the glass,

and I'm a free man.

How the hell did you get out?

We'll swap prison
stories another time.

Right now, all you need to know

is that your bail's
been set at 200 grand.

And I'm willing to play banker.

â™ª â™ª

Shower? You're on.

Billy, wait up.

Hey, Jo.

Can I talk to you privately?

I'll jump in the shower.

I'll be there in a minute.

Nice to see you again, Jo.

I take it you two
are seeing each other?

Yeah, I guess you
could say that.

That's kind of quick, isn't it?

I mean, Alison's only
been gone a few days.

She still loves you, Billy.

No, she doesn't.

And it doesn't matter,
'cause I don't love her,

I love Brooke.

We're getting married
on Saturday.

What?

Look, I know it's news to you,

but what Brooke and
I have is real,

and when it's real, it
happens fast, you know?

That's a pretty convenient
rationalization.

The wedding's at 4:00 at Brooke's
house in Pasadena, all right?

There's an invitation
in your mailbox.

Billy, anyone can see
you're on the rebound.

Well, this isn't
anybody's business.

Jo, I understand
your loyalty to Alison.

You know, you wanted things
to work out between us

and it just didn't.

I think you're making a mistake.

Well, then I guess you
shouldn't be RSVP-ing.

â™ª â™ª

Well, it must
feel great to be home.

Yeah, I just wish I didn't still
have a noose hanging around my neck.

I hate women.

Correction... I hate all the women
I've ever been in love with.

So, how long were you in jail?

In and out in three days.

I've been following my lawyer's
advice and laying low.

Which reminds me, I have
an appointment for you.

He can see you at 5:00.

Uh, thanks, but at the
moment I can't even afford

the rent on this beach house, much
less high-rent legal counsel.

I can.

He got me out with a
slap on the wrist...

2,000 hours of community
service in a free clinic.

And you were guilty.

Imagine what he could do for me.

Consider it a package
deal, Mancini.

Legal fees and bail.

That's very generous.

But what's in it for you?

I've got a medical board hearing
at the end of the week.

They want to yank my license.
You're kidding.

Just because you tried to
kill one of your patients?

I've done a lot of things in
my past that I'm not proud of.

And I'm paying for them now.

But I'm a changed man
and I'm a good doctor.

Now, tell me you can't
relate to that.

I want you to go
before the board,

recant your prior testimony

regarding Amanda's
emergency appendectomy.

Now, you wipe my slate
clean, I wipe yours,

and we both start out fresh,

maybe even as partners
in our own practice,

like we always talked about.

So all I have to do
is backpedal a little,

and I get my name cleared

and a chance to hang
a shingle in Beverly Hills.

I hate to admit it,

but this is starting
to sound very interesting.

What can I say?

I got a soft spot
for you, Mancini.

We're two of a kind.

God grant me the serenity

to accept the things
I cannot change,

courage to change
the things I can,

and the wisdom to
know the difference.

Excuse me.

I related to everything
you shared.

It took me two years
to get used to living

this far away from home.

Ian Sinclair.

We met at the luncheon
the other day?

Oh, right.

You're in Armstrong's
sales division.

Don't tell anyone in the
company I'm this homesick.

My lips are sealed.

Making friends helps.

And having a sponsor.

Do you have one?

Not in Hong Kong.

Well, you do now,
if you want one.

I'm five years sober and I
speak pretty good English.

Sure, that'd be terrific.

I know how rough it can be.

So I'll be checking on you.

And feel free to call,
anytime, day or night.

I doubt I'll be doing that,

but thanks anyway.

How could they foreclose on you?

Sydney invested
$100,000 of my money

in Mancini Designs
just last month!

I used the money to
pay off our creditors,

but it still wasn't enough!

Maybe if you hadn't been so busy

every time I tried to tell you
the business was in trouble,

Michael, it wouldn't
come as such a shock.

Oh, don't make me the whipping
boy for your failure.

This is on your head, Jane!

Half of LA is
already hard at work,

and you're still in
your bathrobe?

You know, Jane, if you
worked a little harder,

you'd be able to pay DD the fees
you owe from your last campaign.

What's he doing out of jail?

Oh, he is out on bail,

courtesy of your
ex-boyfriend, Peter Burns.

That's impossible.

Peter should be even farther
down the river than you.

He has a great lawyer.

Check that: We have
a great lawyer.

I don't believe this.

What kind of country
is this that they let

two vile criminals like
you out of jail?

No, don't tell me,
'cause I don't want to know.

Stay the hell away
from me, Michael.

Oh, ask me to do something hard.

You're flattering yourself

if you think I'd risk
a jail term for you.

I'm an innocent man,

and once I prove it,

I'm gonna slap you with a
defamation of character suit

that'll drain your
bank account so fast

that you'll be in chapter 11,

just like Janie here.

What's this about chapter 11?

The bank seized all my assets.

I'm in foreclosure.

And, unfortunately, DD is
gonna have to get in line

with all the other
bill collectors.

How devastating for you, Jane.

But don't worry about
its impact on DD,

because as of
2:00 this afternoon,

the president of
Mackenzie Hart Designs

will be in my office signing
his exclusive contract.

Mackenzie Hart?

She was my inspiration.

I mean, she was the reason
I became a designer.

I can see how she would
be, considering her skill

in choosing savvy
business partners.

Too bad you didn't have someone
like Richard Hart behind you.

Introduce me.

Sorry, no can do.

Then at least show him
my designs.

Trust me, I don't think Richard
Hart would be interested

in the pencil scrawls
of a bankrupt wannabe.

So the ink's not even dry yet,

and you're already
his spokesperson?

In this case, yes.

Well, unlike you, I have
a job to get to.

Bye.

â™ª â™ª

I'll have the sketches
for you next week

and we can get
together for lunch.

Fine. Just call my office. Okay.

Mr. Hart.

Hi, uh, my name is Jane Mancini.

What are you doing here? If I could
have just a minute of your time.

How dare you.

Amanda, what's this all about?

It's about what I can
do for you, Mr. Hart...

See, I'm a designer.

A desperate, out-of-work one.

I apologize for this
woman's behavior.

No problem.

I'll see you next week.

Okay. Mr. Hart, please, just...

You are not going anywhere.

Careful!

Wait! Ah!

Amanda, are you all right?

Look, um, I've never done
anything like this before,

but Mr. Hart...
You know, I'm sure

that you're a good designer,

but I leave all the hiring
to our personnel office.

I had my own company
until yesterday.

And I think if you just
took a look at my designs,

you might see that...

Forget it. Sorry to
have bothered you.

Don't be.

If my looking at your designs
was important enough to, uh,

knock the president
of DD on her ass,

how can I say no?

Drop by the office tomorrow.

Thank you.

Thank you so much.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, Syd.

Michael, you're not
on the lam, are you?

Relax, I'm out on bail.

So, what did you
find out about Kimberly?

Uh, well, I called around all
the motels around the hospital

and found out she's
at the Casa Malibu Motel.

Yes, and?

And, I think you're wrong
about her this time, Michael.

She was very sweet to me
when I interrogated her.

Trust me, it was an act.

She hates your guts almost
as much as she hates mine.

So did you check out the room?

No, I didn't have time.

Maybe now that you're out
of jail, you could do it.

Oh, right... somebody sees
me there, I'm dog meat.

Back behind
bars in a nanosecond.

Come on, Syd, don't
make me beg, okay?

What if I get caught?

You won't.

And bring a camera.

I think there may be dead
bodies in her bathtub.

That's it, no, "Thanks, Syd"?

No, "You're a real pal, Syd"?

Sure, yeah. All of the above.

Call me as soon as you have
something to report, okay?

â™ª â™ª

Yeah, I want a dozen
white roses.

No, make it two.

And I want to include
a gift card with that.

"To Carol, just thinking of you."

"Love..."

No, no, write,
write, "Forever, Paul."

And add it to my account, okay?

Thank you.

Are you ready?

Are you kidding?

Been looking forward
to seeing you all day.

Yeah? Me, too.

Call for you on line one.

Thanks.

Dr. Shaw. Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

Is anybody there?

â™ª â™ª

Oh, my God, that's me.

â™ª â™ª

Kim, you are not a well woman.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

Well, what do you want me to do,

arrest Dr. Shaw for
scary pictures?

Well, the woman is a nut
case, and she's dangerous.

I hate to break this to you,
but you got zip here.

What are you saying?

Well, if you got these pictures

the way I think you got 'em,

I'm saying your best bet is

to walk right out that
door and keep going.

Kimberly Shaw has a natural
aptitude for homicide.

What, do we have to die
before you do anything?

What's your name again, miss?

Sydney.

Sydney Andrews Mancini, right?

Yeah, so?

Didn't she try to kill
you last year?

Spent time in the psych ward.

And you're out on bail

for stalking
and assault and battery.

No, no, that was a
misunderstanding

which will be cleared up.

Yeah. Playtime's over,
I got work to do.

These pictures are
practically proof positive.

The only thing those
pictures are proof of

is you breaking and entering,

so out, before I
reconsider and arrest you.

I want you to tell
your mother to bring you

back here next week,
same time, got it?

Okay! Okay.

You're good with kids.

Too bad you're
lousy with adults.

Well, it's great to see
you, too, Kimberly.

Amanda told me that you
bailed Michael out of jail.

Don't you know how
dangerous he is?

Well, Mancini may
be a lot of things,

but I don't think he's a
one-man reign of terror.

Right, and we know what a great
judge of character you are.

Well, you're right.

I might have been off the
mark with Caitlin and Amanda.

Would you like to talk about
your sterling judgment

in choosing Mancini, hmm?

Point well taken.

And although you say that
I'm no judge of character,

I've always had
great respect for you.

Oh, is that right?

As well as great fascination.

It might interest you to know

that you've guest-starred in

several of my sexual fantasies.

Careful, doctor.

With all your trouble,
the last thing you need

is a sexual harassment suit.

How about a date then?

Hmm?

I don't know.

What if the reality
doesn't measure up?

What if it does?

The failure of Mancini designs

had nothing to do

with my ability as a designer.

How's that?

I had more orders
than I could fill.

I was fielding offers
to expand worldwide.

I just didn't have the
capital to make it happen,

thanks to an unfortunate
choice of business partners.

Well, we've all made
bad choices.

But your work is solid,

uh, more importantly,
innovative.

So you'll pass my portfolio
on to Mackenzie?

I'd be glad to; I'm impressed.

Let's have dinner tonight,

and we'll discuss it further.

The three of us...
You, me, and Mackenzie.

Thanks, Richard, I...

I really appreciate this.

I'll see you later.

Amanda Woodward.

Hello, Amanda.

Alison, you sound so close,

like you're in the next room.

I'm not sure how I got you.

Because of the time difference,

I keep getting everyone's
answering machine, and

I thought I'd try to
catch Brooke at work.

Oh, you must be calling
to congratulate her.

Why? Did she get a promotion?

Don't you know?

Know what?

Well, I'm surprised one
of your so-called friends

didn't tell you.

Brooke's getting married
this Saturday.

To whom?

To Billy.

In fact, she's out shopping
for her wedding dress now.

I'm the maid of honor.

Oh, really?

It's been quite a whirlwind

since you left.

I'll tell Brooke
that you called.

Alison?

Alison?

â™ª â™ª

Hey, got a minute?

Yeah. I need a favor.

You want a beer?

Yeah, that, that might help.

Cheers.

Uh, Brooke and I

are getting married on Saturday.

You're kidding,
you just met her.

Yeah, but I know what I
feel, and it's right.

Seems to me I
remember hearing you say

something like that
about a year ago.

Yeah, but this time
it... it's different.

Alison was a total roller
coaster, you know?

I couldn't even depend on
her to know her own mind.

Brooke knows what she
wants; She wants me.

And it doesn't change
on a daily basis.

And more importantly, I
love her, and I trust her.

I'm sure that you do.

Look, I just came over here
to ask you to be my best man.

So if you're thinking
of hitting me again...

No, I just, uh... look, I
don't mean to judge you.

I just want you to be happy.

If you need a best man,
you got one.

Thanks. That means a lot.

We've had our ups and downs,

but I always believed
that Billy and I

would work things out,

that we'd be together.

Alison, maybe what
you need to do

is get on the plane,

go home and tell him how
you feel, face to face.

That's probably a better idea

than falling off
the wagon in Hong Kong,

but I can't.

I just started here, I
owe it to Mr. Armstrong

to honor my contract.

I don't see why you wouldn't
be able to get time off.

It's obvious to everyone
Armstrong's a huge fan of yours.

Why do you say that?

Because he created
your position for you.

You're the first VP of Marketing

our company's ever had.

â™ª â™ª

I'm sorry you have to go to
Lindsay's graduation alone.

I'd love to be there.

She's my niece, too.

Oh, come on, I know how you
hate these stuffy affairs.

But I love you.

Well, you're off
the hook this time,

but when I get back,

I expect a hero's welcome.

You'll get it and my
undivided attention.

I'll drive you down to Laguna,

we'll eat, shop,
anything you want.

Promise.

Hi, it's me.

Hi.

So, what happened?

Oh, it was really bad.

Thank God that it's over.

Carol moved out.

Well, I'm really
happy for you...

if that's what you wanted.

Oh, of course
it's what I wanted,

for both of us.

Paul, I need to
tell you that I, I'm...

I'm not ready to just

rush right into
a relationship again.

I understand.

Take all the time
that you need, I...

I want us to be together,
Matt, and I...

I want you to be
comfortable about it.

Just in c... can I see
you later, after work?

I don't know, I, um...

Please.

I've just been through
a major life change.

I could really use some company.

All right.

Why don't you meet me
at the hospital at 8:00?

Okay.

Okay.

Bye.

So, do you think
of yourself as talented?

I think I have
a certain facility,

but there's always room
to hone one's craft.

What do you think
makes a good designer?

A combination
of instinct and ability.

Ever stolen another
designer's designs?

No.

So, what do you think?

She's pretty good, isn't she?

I have to go.

Pay the bill, will you, Richard?

Goodbye, Janet.

Oh, uh, by the way,

monochromatic is out.

She hates me.

She hates my work.

And she doesn't even
know my name.

Yes, she does.

I know this woman like
the back of my hand.

If she didn't like you,

she would've left by the
time the salad arrived.

Don't let her throw you,

'cause you start tomorrow.

â™ª â™ª

Hey. So what's this good news

that you could
only tell me here?

Um...

I got the job with
Robbins Construction.

Yeah... they're gonna be putting
up buildings all over town.

I mean, it's gonna
give me a future, Jo.

Oh, God, that's great.

You got a job, congratulations.
Thanks.

Look, it's not just
about me, it's about us.

I mean, I haven't taken my
future seriously in a long time.

I mean, you're home to me, Jo.

But now I'm in the position

to make things more permanent

between the two of us.

Jo...

will you marry me?

Yeah, right.

Oh, come on, Jess, I mean,

this is kind of out of
left field, a little bit.

Yeah, yeah, I guess it is
kind of funny, you know,

a guy like me
asking a woman like you

to marry him, huh?

No, no no no, that isn't it.

I mean, it's just that, uh...

you surprised me.

I mean, uh...

I thought you were kidding.

That's fine.

That's fine, let's get
on the bike, let's go.

No, hey, Jess, God, I am
so sorry, I'm sorry!

I... look, it's beautiful here.

Let's just stay and look
at the view, and...

Come on, I just
wasn't expecting this.

You know, what, I've
had a long day.

And I'm really not
in the mood to talk, okay?

So just get on the bike.

Come on, Jess.

Get on the bike, Jo.

I'm taking you home.

â™ª â™ª

What a coincidence.

You're home...

and I have two tickets

to the opera.

â™ª â™ª

I hate the opera.

â™ª â™ª

The state medical board
meets in two days.

We need to rehearse.

So do I get a script, or do
you want me to wing it?

Hardly.

I want you to tell the board

that I displayed
superior judgment

in a medical emergency,

and that in hindsight,

you now concur, given how the
patient presented medically.

That's a good one; Anything
else you want me to lie about?

Yes. I want you to tell
them that Amanda Woodward

is lawsuit happy,

that she's taking direct aim

at the doctors
at Wilshire Memorial,

that even after getting

her own lifesaving protocol

to treat her Hodgkin's,

she still sued you, Michael.

Oh, boy, you are
some piece of work.

Thank you.

Oh, by the way,

seeing as we're
getting along so well,

I thought as a courtesy
I would let you know

that I'm dating your ex-wife.

I'll refer to her by name
to avoid any confusion...

Kimberly.

Are you crazy? Because she is.

Well, so am I... about her.

And who knows? If we're
all adult about this,

maybe someday we'll double date.

Thanks, Mike.

â™ª â™ª

So what do you think?

I think they're
tired and rehashed.

Well, that seems to be
the consensus.

Whose designs are they?

Mackenzie's.

Jane, I did some
homework on you.

Your spring '94 line
was provocative,

youthful...

and wearable.

I hired you to bring
those qualities

to the Mackenzie Hart line.

So Mackenzie can just

rubber-stamp my designs?

You know that's how it works.

75% of our sales
are to women under 40,

and Mackenzie has lost
touch with that market.

You've got the pulse.

I don't know how long I can
live with being anonymous.

You'll make more staying
behind the scenes here

than you ever did with
your name on a label.

Richard, you have to
understand something about me.

It's not just the money.

I happen to like getting
credit for my work.

Look, let's talk
about it tonight,

just you and me.

Jane, I'm gonna do
whatever I have to

to keep you happy.

All right.

Then you can start
by buying me dinner.

Good.

â™ª â™ª

You just walked right in.

The maÃ®tre d' knew who you were,

had your favorite
table reserved.

Didn't that appeal to you?

Yes...'cause I'm gonna
have all that someday...

Money, recognition,

respect of my peers.

That's interesting, because

one of the things
that I heard about you

is that you have the skills

but not the killer
instinct to go all the way.

Well, you heard wrong.

Would you like to come in?

Nah. No. It's late.

I should be going. No, don't.

I think it's time you had
a woman your own age.

â™ª â™ª

Haley Armstrong, please.

May I say who's calling?

Alison Parker.
One moment, please.

Alison.

Yeah, I hear you're doing
a terrific job for us.

Listen, I'm planning
a trip out there

in the next couple of weeks.

How about we have dinner?

Let's not.

I'm tendering my resignation,

effective immediately.

I'm sorry, I don't understand.

You created this position for me

on the other side of the world.

And we both know it
wasn't for my benefit

or the company's.

I don't know where do you
get your information...

Don't patronize me.

I also know that Billy and
Brooke are getting married.

Is there anything
you wouldn't do for her?

Look, Alison, I admit I
created the position for you,

but it's not for
the reasons you think.

I have an eye for talent,
you're a very...

Save it.

I've already faxed
a copy of my resignation

to you and Brooke.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

Dr. Shaw.

You have succeeded in completely

destroying my attention span.

And for that I get a rose?

Yes.

And an invitation.

The Beverly Hills
Physicians Association

is having their annual
cocktail party

tomorrow night.

Now, I know it's short notice,

but I would love for
you to be my date.

I see, you're afraid
if you go alone,

you'll be fed to the lions.

I have been cleared
of all criminal charges.

In short, I'd like
to show you off.

People might think
we're a couple.

I hope so.

I'll pick you up about 7:00?

Bring your toothbrush.

â™ª â™ª

Ohh...

You are getting distracted.

I can't take this.

I swear to God, I'll kill myself

if that's the only way
to get rid of you.

â™ª â™ª

Don't do anything you'll regret.

I've tried suicide before.

Don't think
I won't try it again.

â™ª â™ª

No!

Kimberly!

I'm sorry, if you die, I'm free,

if I die, it doesn't matter,

If we both die, good riddance!

Kimberly! Kimberly, stop!

â™ª â™ª

No!

â™ª â™ª

I'm free.

I'm free.

â™ª â™ª

Brooke Armstrong.

It's me.

Don't you pick up your messages?

Sorry, Daddy, I spent
the night at Billy's.

Your friend Alison quit.

She found out about the wedding,

she's heading back
to the States.

What? How could you do this?

How could you let her
out of her contract?

I didn't let her,
darling, she just walked.

I will not have my wedding
spoiled by Alison.

Look, tell Billy to stay over at
the house until the ceremony.

Just tell him that we need
more rehearsal or something.

We'll just keep Alison from
finding out where he is.

It'll all go off without
a hitch, I promise you.

Well, it better.

'Cause if it doesn't, I'm gonna
hold you personally responsible

for ruining the most
important day of my life.

I certainly hope
that wasn't a client.

Alison found out
about the wedding.

Oh, right. Sorry about that.

When she called for you
the other day,

I assumed she already knew.

You told her?
Well, inadvertently.

But you don't have to worry, she's
not exactly on the guest list.

Oh, here's the groom-to-be.

24 hours and counting.

Mmm.

So, you ready to go?

Yes, but I just
got off the phone

with the wedding
coordinator, and

everything is
just going haywire.

Would you mind terribly
staying at the house tonight?

It would really help
keep us on schedule.

Sure, why not?

Okay.

I'll make sure Daddy's chauffeur
picks up your things.

Great.

â™ª â™ª

Hello!

I was worried sick

when you didn't
come home all night.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I should've called.

Well, where'd you go
after you dropped me off?

Nowhere, really.
Just drove around.

Look...

I was a jerk, okay?

I could've handled it better,

but I'm just not
that good at this.

All you have to do
is talk to me.

I know!

I know, but the whole
thing got under my skin.

I mean, how do you sleep
in the same bed

with somebody who just said no

to your marriage proposal?

I felt like an idiot, Jo.

I didn't mean to hurt
you, I just... you threw me.

I mean, we never talked about
any kind of commitment.

I don't know
if I'm ready for one.

I shouldn't have
sprung it on you,

but I felt it, so I said it.

Hanson! I don't pay you
to stand around and talk.

Tell your girlfriend
she can't park on the site.

Yeah, all right.

I got to get back to work.

Am I gonna see you tonight?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'll come right home.

I did miss you, Jo.

I missed you, too.

â™ª â™ª

I'm sorry I missed
the breakfast meeting.

I overslept.

I'm not surprised.

Apparently you were
out quite late.

I had a working dinner
with Jane Mancini.

We went over some
sketches for the fall line.

I tried calling you
several times, Richard.

I gave up at 1:00.

We had a lot to cover.

Now, is there something else
that you'd like to discuss?

You slept with her, didn't you?

No.

Even if I did,

we agreed that it was okay
to see other people.

Do you remember that, Mackenzie?

Only because I didn't
want to lose you.

Richard, this is too painful.

I can't stand to think of
you with another woman.

You're gonna be
late for your meeting.

Richard, I love you.

Look, I, uh...

I know I'm not as young as Jane,

but you can't tell me you still
don't feel something for me.

You know I do.

Uh, let's get this fabric
in a lighter shade.

Thanks.

â™ª â™ª

I know that I was supposed
to make dinner,

but considering that I don't
even know how to boil water,

I thought it best to order in.

You don't know how to cook?

No, and that kitchen of
mine is a chef's dream.

Too bad that there's
nobody around to use it.

I'd like to get in
there sometime.

Really?

How about tomorrow night then?

I could pick up the fixings,

and you could man the stove.

Sounds like a plan.

So, um...

have you heard from your wife?

No.

In fact, the only
people that I expect

to hear from are her movers.

She took out of here
in such a hurry that

she left a lot
of her things behind.

These, for instance,

which I hope she
forgets altogether.

They're beautiful,
are they antiques?

Her great-grandmother's.
Check 'em out.

That stamp means that they
were made in London in 1879.

Must be worth a small fortune.

They are.

And I'll be sorry
to see them go.

But they're Carol's, after all,

so I guess she
deserves them, right?

Ready for some garlic chicken?

Pile it on.

Uh, do you have a minute?

Uh, yeah. Of course. Come on in.

Something wrong? Uh, no.

Just saw you and Mackenzie
earlier looking pretty cozy.

Kissing, actually.

Jane, we built
the company together.

What you saw was nothing more

than affection between friends.

Really?

And, did you mention
to your friend

that you spent
the night with me?

You're gonna have to understand

that these are
unusual circumstances.

I may be the CEO, but
she's the name,

and whether we're
divorced or not,

my reputation
is married to hers.

In other words,

you kiss her to keep your job.

On some level, yes.

So what else do you do
to keep her happy?

Not throw my love
life in her face.

All right.

But know this...

I have no intention
of playing the other woman.

Especially when you're
not married.

I thought we'd be
in the air by now.

I wonder what the problem is.

It's a 13-hour flight,

and I have a wedding to get to.

As it is, I'm pushing it.

Well, I hope you're not
in the wedding party.

Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.

We are currently experiencing
some minor mechanical problems...

Oh, crap.

Probably have to
change planes now.

While the aircraft
is being serviced,

please feel free to enjoy
our first class lounge.

We estimate the delay to
be approximately four hours.

I'm not gonna make it.

You know, for years
I've been trying

to get invited to this event,

But now,

all I want to do is go
home and jump your bones.

Easy, Tiger, business
before pleasure, right?

Thank you.

Thank you.

I want you, Peter,

like I've never wanted
any other man.

The feeling is mutual,

and I promise I'll
prove it to you...

later.

Have I told you

how beautiful you look tonight?

Hmm?

You make me feel beautiful.

You make me feel
a lot of things.

I've had a lot
of demons in my life,

but now that you're part of it,

they're gone.

Good evening, folks.

Hello.

What, um, what are
you two doing here?

Well, Michael was
invited... of course...

By your date, and he brought me.

Well, as your doctor,
my advice is

dating Michael can be
hazardous to your health.

So glad you both could join us.

A pleasure, Pete.

I wish I could say the same,

but I hate cheap
sentiments, don't you?

You know, Michael, I never
realized how little class you had

until I started dating someone
who actually had some.

Yeah, well, don't count on
it rubbing off, Kimberly.

Now, who here might
benefit my career?

Ah, let's start with cardiology
and work our way down.

Uh, excuse me.

People are walking all over you,

Kimberly.

Rubbing your nose
in their deceit.

And Peter...

your precious Peter.

He's their friend now.

That's not true.

That's not true,
he's just using them.

Please,

please, just let me have him,

and I swear, I'll do
whatever you want.

I swear it.

Fine.

But first, tell me once again

what are you going
to do to the others?

â™ª â™ª

I'll... I'll kill...

Michael and Sydney

and Amanda.

I'll kill them all.

Mmm. Mmm... morning.

Ohh...

I hated sleeping
alone last night.

With all of my family here,

Daddy was worried
about appearances.

Well, it's the last time
we'll have to do that.

Are you sure you're
not having any doubts?

None.

What about Alison?

Don't tell me Brooke Armstrong
has a case of the nerves.

I'm serious.

I don't think it's possible

for me to love you
any more than I do.

I need to know
you feel the same way.

All you need to know is that I
love you and I'm marrying you.

I want to grow old with you.

Just not too fast.

Mmm.

We are gonna have
a wonderful life.

I'm gonna make you so happy.

It was a rush to judgment,

a mistake on my part.

I've since come to learn

that in light of the patient's
now-documented symptoms,

Dr. Burns had every
reason to believe

that surgery was necessary.

He's a fine, fine, physician,

and any testimony
you may hear to the contrary

will only be coming from a
money-hungry former patient

looking for a lawsuit.

I was stabbed with a hypodermic,

almost cut open,

badly treated for my cancer,

and sexually harassed.

As far as I'm concerned, all
the doctors who treated me

should have their
license taken away,

and if you don't revoke
Dr. Burns' license,

I will not only sue
Wilshire Memorial,

but I will sue each and every
board member in this room

for reckless endangerment.

Now, if that's all,

I have a wedding to attend.

Amanda.

Frankly, I thought
you had better taste.

What can I say?

One woman's trash is
another woman's treasure.

Hey,

I'm the one who's gonna
be telling the medical board

that you're the best chief of
staff I've ever worked with,

so pay attention to me.

We are ready for you, Dr. Shaw.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, Pop.

Jane. Hi.

Hi. Mmm.

I know you must have
mixed feelings about this.

But I really appreciate
you coming.

Hey, you and I are friends, too.

I'm sure Alison
would understand that.

Oh, Billy, I want you
to meet Richard Hart.

Richard, this is Billy Campbell.

Congratulations.

Thank you very much.

So, how do you feel?

Well, concerned, actually.

The best man's isn't here
and he has the ring.

Oh, I saw Jake and Amanda
in the parking lot.

Oh, there they are
right now, excuse me.

See you guys.
All right, see you later.

Hey, it's about time,
there, chief.

Hey, look at this, huh?

Oh, I'm so happy for you, Billy.
Thank you.

Thank God you've outgrown your
masochistic obsession with Alison.

Hey, isn't it a little
rude to be

talking about the
groom's ex-girlfriends?

Oh, I guess you're a
little sensitive about

ex-girlfriends these days.

Excuse me.

â™ª â™ª

Well, what a surprise.

I had no idea you two
were that familiar.

Uh, we work together now.

Richard brought me on
as consulting designer.

Ah.

Only yesterday you
were on the verge

of bankruptcy and unemployment.

Well, we're, uh, we're
thrilled to have her.

If you ladies would
excuse me one minute,

I see someone I know. Okay.

Although I'm still recovering

from that little
body slam I took,

I must hand it to you, Jane.

You aimed, you fired,

and you hit the bull's-eye,
Richard Hart.

Some of your ruthlessness
must have rubbed off on me.

Good thing you have
so much to spare.

Billy.

Hey, Mr. Armstrong.

Jake Hanson.

Yeah. Of course.

Good to see you.
Congratulations.

Thank you very much.

Excuse us for a
minute, will you?

Sure. Thank you.

Well, what do you think, son?

Are you pleased with the way
this is all turning out?

Yeah, it's, it's amazing.

And, uh, I've been meaning
to tell you, Mr. Armstrong,

I really appreciate you
covering all the expenses.

Oh, come on, call me Hayley.

Oh, and one other thing, Billy.

My daughter's used to
getting what she wants,

and I am accustomed
to providing it.

Now it's your turn.

And since you weren't exactly
my first choice for Brooke,

I expect you to
make her extra happy.

Well, I hope that
we're both happy.

No, no, no.

The point is,

if you do anything to
hurt my little girl,

I'm gonna take it
all away from you...

The job, the career,

your self-respect, everything.

You see, I have the power to bounce
you from VP to street sweeper,

and do it all before I've
had my morning coffee.

Am I making myself clear?

Yes, very clear.

But you don't have to threaten
me to do right by your daughter,

and, Hayley, if you're gonna do
anything to hurt our marriage,

then you're gonna have
me to deal with.

Am I making myself very clear?

You have a backbone.

I'm surprised.

At least there's one
thing I like about you.

â™ª â™ª

Hi.

The good news is that

I bought all the groceries
we're gonna need for tonight,

including dessert.
And the bad news?

I have to work later
than I planned.

But I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind

going up to the house,
getting things started,

and then, when I come up,
we can both have dinner

and we'll still have
time to catch a movie.

Sure... I guess.

What time are you thinking?

I don't know. 4:00?

I'll get there as close
to 6:00 as I can.

How about if you pick the movie?

Deal.

Great.

I got to get back to the office,

but, hey.

I'm really looking forward
to that leg of lamb,

and, uh, hey, thanks
for being so flexible.

No sweat.

Wait. W...

What about the alarm?

Don't worry, it's not set.

Just make yourself
at home, okay?

Whew...

You're worried, aren't you?

Well, it might be
a natural condition,

given my entire career is
hanging in the balance.

Yeah, but there's nothing
you can do about it now

except wait, and, uh...

somehow pass the time.

Care to join me on the sofa?

Hold that thought.

Yes.

I see.

All right.

Well, it was
good of you to call.

Thank you.

Well?

Needless to say, that
was the medical board.

I keep my license.

Oh, God, that's fantastic news!

Mmm, congratulations.

I know exactly
how we can celebrate.

Listen, that's just part one.

Part two is getting reinstated
back at Wilshire Memorial,

and I have a lot of work to do.

I think it would be best if you
went home, and I'll call you later.

All right? You want me to leave?

I have a lot of work to do, and

you are definitely
a distraction.

Come on, don't you want to
at least grab some dinner,

have some champagne at the
beach, watch the sunset?

Yes.

Let's just see how much
progress I make tonight.

Oh, come on...

No, really.

Yeah. So you'll call me later?

Yes.

I'll call you later.

Thanks.

She just came out of Peter's.

Amanda, it's Peter.

Please don't erase this
before listening to it.

Seeing you today made me realize

how much I miss you in my life.

I think that we should
settle things between us

or at least talk,

so, if you would,

give me a call, Amanda.

Now she's just hanging around,
I don't know what she's doing.

Syd, I don't have time for this.

If she does something
incriminating, let me know.

Otherwise, I'm on rounds.

Michael, I told you
last night, she's crazy.

Thank you.

You see?

They're all against you.

It's time, Kimberly.

It's time.

Wait wait wait,
she's on the move.

Call you back.

Don't bother.

I'll be in touch.

â™ª â™ª

Hi. Hi, yes, ma'am?

560 Flintridge Drive, Pasadena.

Please hurry. Yes,
ma'am, right away.

Oh.

Come on, Paul,
come on, where are you?

Mrs. Graham?

â™ª â™ª

Mrs. Graham?

â™ª â™ª

Freeze!

Put your hands up
where I can see them!

Look, I just got here!

Turn around, turn around!

Get up against the wall!

Get up against the wall!

You have the right
to remain silent.

Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

You have the right to
speak with an attorney,

and to have an attorney
present during questioning.

â™ª â™ª

Hey.

Jess, what are you doing
here at this time of day?

Swing shift.

Figured I'd come home,

grab a bite to eat,

and take care of a little

unfinished business
between the two of us.

I want you to know
how serious I am, Jo.

I want you to marry me.

Wait.

Jess...

I don't know where
you got that, but...

But what?

You think I stole it?

No.

No, I wasn't saying that.

No, what... you still believe
Jake more than you do me.

Maybe you even love him more
than you love me. Jess...

All I'm trying to say is that,

instead of racing
into marriage, that

maybe we should slow
down for a while.

So, what are you saying?

Huh? You want to break
up with me?

I'm saying that we have great
sex and we have a good time,

And there's a lot
of potential there,

but we have to know
each other more

before getting that serious.

Fine.

Okay.

Get out.

You're gonna wear this
damn ring on your finger

if I gotta shove it on myself!
No!

Get...
Get out of here!

Aah!

Come here!

No! Stop!

No!

No, Jess!

No!

Stop! Aah! One thing straight...

You belong to me! No!

And the rest of the
world's gonna know it!

â™ª â™ª

Now clean this place up!

I got to get back to work.

â™ª â™ª

This ring, a perfect circle,

symbolizes the union
of two people,

complete in themselves, but who,

because of the love and
commitment for one another,

choose to share their
life together forever.

Do you, William Campbell,
take Brooke Armstrong

to be your lawful wedded wife,

to have and hold

in sickness and in health,

for richer or poorer,
till death do you part?

Billy! Don't!

Alison, what are you doing? Billy,
Brooke set this whole thing up.

Alison, please. She arranged
to have me shipped off.

Billy, I love you.
I know you love me, too.

Daddy, do something.

Guards! Get this woman
out of here, please.

Billy! Billy,
I wrote you a letter.

I told you I loved
you. I gave it to Brooke!

She must have rewritten it!

You've gotta believe me!

What are you talking about?

She's lying. She's
an obsessed alcoholic.

Hey, don't hurt her.

All right, everybody,
just calm down.

Let her go.

I know I've hurt you,

but don't do this.

We can work things out.

Billy, you're my best friend.

You're the only
man I've ever loved.

Please, Billy.

Don't make a decision
you'll regret

for the rest of your life.

You have got to let go.

I'm getting married here.

Now, if you can't respect that,

then please, as a friend, go.

Now.

It's... it's okay.

Alison. Let go of
me, I'm leaving.

Alison, wait.

Alison, I know
you're really hurting.

Let me go with you,
let me give you a ride.

I'd rather walk home on my hands

than take a ride
from a traitor like you.

Whoo!

Whoo!

Oh, thanks for everything.

Congratulations,
the best woman won.

Thanks.

You almost let Alison
ruin my wedding.

You better keep her
away from my honeymoon.

Don't worry, it'll be all right.

Okay.

Congratulations, Billy.

We'll talk to you soon.

Bye, sweetheart!

Thank God that is over.

Let's concentrate on
the fun stuff. Mm.

Can't wait to get to Hawaii
to be alone with you.

You do have the tickets, right?

I got them right in here.

Oh, my God.

I knew it, I left them.

I left them back
at the apartment.

It's not Freudian.

Well, we'll just have to go back
there and get them, won't we?

Actually, we have a little time

before the plane
leaves, and we could

make good use of it.

What's meant to be
is meant to be.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

You crazy psycho.

Let me go, I'm gonna
call the cops.

â™ª â™ª

What? And let you tell them
I'm making a bomb?

I don't think so.

â™ª â™ª

You're not having
a very good day, are you?

â™ª â™ª

Yeah? Peter Burns?

Uh-huh.

Happy whatever.

Thank you.

Amanda.

Look, you know, I told you,

Paul gave me a key.

I was supposed to make dinner

for the two of us, and, uh,

I got to the house.

The alarm was supposed
to be off, and it wasn't.

Mmhm.

Then I tried to call him
at the office,

and that's when I saw her,

that, you know, she
was already dead.

So you're a friend
of Dr. Graham's?

Yes.

How good a... friend?

Look, if you're asking
if we were lovers...

yes, we were involved. Mmhm.

Is that why Dr. and Mrs. Graham

filed a complaint against
you with our office?

What?

Well, isn't it true that
you were harassing them?

Driving by the house,
calling at odd hours?

No, that, that, that isn't true.

So you never called Dr. Graham

or dropped by the house
before tonight?

No!

N-n... well, yes... no,

but they're
not together anymore.

Paul filed for divorce.

Isn't this wishful
thinking on your part?

Look, you know what, I don't
know what you're getting at,

but I... I didn't do
anything wrong.

Do you have an
attorney, Mr. Fielding?

I think you're gonna need one.

Excuse me.

Paul.

You murdered my wife.

You disgusting pervert.

Paul. I'm gonna kill you!

Paul! No! No! Dr. Graham!

Hold it! Hold it!

Dr. Graham, hold it, hold it!

Dr. Graham! Now, you let
the courts handle this.

Paul, you can't
think that I did this!

This is crazy!

This... this is a mistake!

I told her to never be alone.

I told her that you
were dangerous.

But she wouldn't listen.

She felt sorry for you,

and you killed her.

You set me up,
you son of a bitch!

Wait a minute, wait a minute!

He set me up!
Wait a minute, hold on!

Get him out of here!

I hope you rot in hell.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

Oh, that was number three.

The fourth one is right
underneath Amanda's apartment.

Mmm, don't you just love

the smell of sulfur
in the afternoon, Sydney?

No? Well, I don't think
Hell is gonna

smell much better, and
since that's where

you're gonna be
spending eternity,

you really better
get used to it.

Now...

Do you want to know
how it's all gonna work?

Four firebombs
strategically placed.

The first one blows up
the laundry room.

That ought to get
everyone's attention.

Especially yours, Syd.

The next one takes out
Alison's apartment.

Not that I have anything
against reformed alcoholics.

It's just that, well,
she happens

to live right
next door to... Matt!

Who is number three...
Bam!

He takes one in the shorts.

And guess what?

I saved the biggest one
for last.

For Amanda, that soulless,

slutty, husband-stealing bitch.

One push of this little button,
and the place is toast.

Now, all I need for you to do

is call Michael at the hospital

and tell him
to come on over, okay?

Help!

Shut up.

â™ª â™ª

What are you going
to do with that?

If you call Michael and tell him
to get his ass over here, nothing.

And if you don't...

Mmm. I'm gonna burn your face

so it matches the color
of your hair.

â™ª â™ª

He's not gonna come here
just because I tell him to,

and if he does, he's
gonna bring the cops.

Well, I guess you're just
gonna have to be creative.

â™ª â™ª

Mancini.

Michael, it's me.

You better be calling to find
out what I want for dinner,

because your Nancy Drew
act is getting old.

You're the one who
asked me to do it,

so don't bail out on me now.

I followed Kimberly to the
apartment building,

and she wants to confess

to stalking Amanda
and setting you up,

but she'll only do it if
you come here in person,

and don't call the police.

Yeah, right, Syd.

Michael, do you want to
clear your name, or not?

All right, I'll come, but
this better be on the level.

And I'm bringing
a tape recorder.

Hurry, Michael, we're
in the laundry room,

and I don't know how much
longer I can keep her here.

What do you think
you're doing here?

I'm here because you invited me,

along with the champagne
you sent.

Sorry I'm early, but you
said not to be late.

You're out of your mind.

I think you'd better leave.

Help me.

Someone help me.

Help me. Jo?

Oh, my God.

Who did this to you?

Call 911.

Jo. Jo, it's Peter Burns.

We need an ambulance...
Now, I need you

to tell me where you were hit.

A woman's been badly beaten.

Are you having
trouble breathing?

No... I don't know, I...

Jake, I'm sorry.

I should have listened to you.

He did this, didn't he?

Who? Where is he?

Let the police
handle this, Jake.

Where is he, damn it?
Is he at work?

Jake, she's right, let
the police handle this.

This is between me
and my brother!

Amanda, help me get her inside.

Amanda.

â™ª â™ª

Is this a social call?

'Cause I'm on the clock.

You like beat on women?

It's our business, Jake...

Me and my fiancÃ©.

You stay out of it.

The minute you laid
a finger on Jo,

you made it my business.

So what are you going
to do, huh?

You gonna hit me again?

Yeah. I'd like to see you bleed.

You know I'm gonna
kill you, Jake!

Hey!

What's going on up there?

Hanson!

Break it up.

I almost had it all, didn't I?

Your damn business,
your girl, your life.

If only that bastard I hired

would have killed you
like he was supposed to.

I guess I'll have to finish
the job myself.

â™ª â™ª

What the...

Michael!

Syd, are you okay?

Huh?

â™ª â™ª

Uhh!

â™ª â™ª

Aah!

What?

She's got bombs
all over the place.

We gotta defuse them,
we gotta get help!

No, what we gotta do is
get the hell out of here.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, everybody!

Get out of here!
There's a bomb in here!

It's all right, I'll go...

Jane! Jane!

Billy! Billy, there's
a bomb in the floor!

We gotta go, we
gotta get out of here!

Sydney, what the hell is going on?
We gotta get out of here.

Kimberly's gone off
the deep end.

She wired the whole building,
it's gonna blow up any minute.

Oh, give me a break, Sydney.

Come on, I'm trying to save
your damn life... come on!

Alison!

Alison!

Go away!

Alison!

Come on, get out! We got to go!

Matt! Come on! There's a bomb!
Hey!

Get out, man, there's a bomb!

The building's gonna blow!

Let's get the hell out of here!

Come on! What the hell
is going on out here?

Jane, come on! Richard!

There you are, you whore!
Oh, my God.

Look, lady, this is
a really bad time.

Jane, I'll take care of this.

We've got to get the hell out of here!
Mackenzie, wait!

Wait, wait!

It's not what it looks like.

Kimberly.

â™ª â™ª

It's worse.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª
