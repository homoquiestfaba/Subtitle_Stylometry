You were right, Varinia.

Vengeance alone is not enough.

To become like your enemy
is to lose to him.

But what's important isn't our
living or our dying...

but this new thing we've
created, however briefly.

A world without slaves.

And if you die, who will
tell that story?

Live, so that I will live.

So that we will live on.

So that it won't be wasted
or forgotten.

Did you see the look
he gave you, Varinia?

I didn't.

And even if I had...

I wouldn't care.

What sort of look?

What look, you?

What look?

You tell me!

I made a promise once
to tell our story.

It began in a small village
in Gaul...

where I was born a free woman.

Then the Romans destroyed my world
and made me a slave.

Nothing and no one could
stand against the Romans.

But Rome herself was torn
by conflict.

Bloody civil wars
raged for years...

between plebeians and their
rivals, the patricians...

led by Senator Marcus Crassus,
the richest man in the world.

As a child, he had seen his father
murdered in the Forum.

Crassus had risen from the
ashes of his family's defeat...

to unlimited wealth
and ambition.

Ambition kept in check only by his
rivals like Antonius Agrippa.

The civil wars were over. Men
smiled at one another in public.

But the fighting never stopped.

Fishing for votes?

No, just enjoying our
democratic way of life.

A new wine. From Spain.

Delicious. But I like your
cupbearer better.

Any news from Spain
along with the wine?

A great victory by Pompey.
Another?

The man is positively
boring in his triumphs.

I shall console myself with the way
Crassus must feel.

Pompey's no great warrior.

He got so fat on the riches of his
triumphs he can't ride his horse.

Disparage Pompey all you like
but the man gets the job done.

Victory over a handful of
vermin ridden Gaulish peasants...

is hardly the mark of
military distinction.

They say he will be Consul.

This grape...

is not to my satisfaction.
More wine.

I think I'm going to
borrow your wife, Cornelius.

The wealth of a man like Crassus
could be seen in gold or silver...

but it's true measure
was in flesh.

Thousands of slaves.

They lived out their short lives
in a world of suffering...

at the whim of their masters.

No Roman citizen gave them
a second thought.

Greetings, citizens.

Today we offer a group of
barbarians from Gaul...

courtesy of the great Pompey.

Ahoy, Batiatus.
What brings you up from Capua?

The same thing as you,
I would imagine.

My stock needs freshening.

Although how a man from the country
can bid against a Senator...

I might as well go home.
A modest man from the country?

Yours is widely known as the finest
gladiatorial school in all Italy.

You flatter me.
No, not in the least.

Look at this beauty.
And a virgin.

A virgin. Given the appetite of
our frontier troops, I doubt that.

Being a virgin is overrated.

It's just an excuse to inflate
the price.

Good teeth.
Wide hips.

And an excellent breeder.

Magnificent.

She's easy on the eye,
I'll grant you...

but these Gauls have
thin blood.

They rarely last the winter. I'd be
like throwing your money away.

Why, Batiatus,
are you in love?

Don't worry, my friend.
I won't bid against you.

You're too kind, Senator.

But I may need a favor some day.
Of course.

Five hundred sesterces!
Done!

How can the Senate choose Pompey
over you as the next Consul?

It would be a close vote.

I bought you a gift.

It's beautiful.

You are too generous.
Am I?

Well, I suppose I might be.

In the arms of the
richest man in Rome...

and her husband's best friend...
Show me.

Helena might be forgiven her
ignorance of the bracelet's origin.

It's true cost.

What is hell?

Hell is that place where the
simplest action becomes painful.

Where it hurts to walk...

to breathe, even to think.

The gold mines of Egypt
were such a hell.

Among the Thracian slaves
condemned to an early death...

one would shake
the Roman world.

His name: Spartacus.

Pick it up!

Pick it up!

No!

Stop!

So he's a Thracian, yes?

Worse. He's an animal.

Good. That's even better.

This is your lucky day,
Thracian.

What kind of a place is this?

Move!

Fresh meat!

Shut your hole!
Get back to work.

You stink, animals.
Clean yourselves.

This way.

I want these cut into thin slices.
I wouldn't give this to a dog!

I could get used to this.

I am Gannicus.
This is Spartacus.

David the Jew. He never talks.
Some say he can't.

You're Thracians?

The crowd likes Thracians.
Be quiet, Nordo. Eat.

Didn't get your name, friend.

You're not my friend. I don't wanna
know your name, your story.

Why not?

I might meet you in the arena
some day, and then I'll kill you.

Why wait?

You'll have plenty of chances
to fight.

Save it for when you
have no choice. Eat.

You must be the new Thracians.

I can almost tell Thracians.
You stink like pigs.

You must be Crixus.
You've heard of me.

Who hasn't? "Crixus the big nose."
Not surprised you could smell us.

Enough!

To your cells! Now!

Well, move, slaves!

You, Spartacus.

Where did you learn to fight?

When a Roman asks you
a question, you answer, slave.

Fighting Romans.

Crassus. What a
pleasant surprise.

I had no idea you still partook
of such common pleasures...

as our public baths.

I do not disdain the public.

You love mankind. It's only
people you can't stand.

Now, why is it that those who are
most in favor of mob rule...

stand most to benefit from the
public's greed and stupidity?

Why is it that the rich are
always so keen on reform...

after they've made their
fortune and not before?

The Republic was a fine form
of government...

when Rome was a
backwater city state.

Times have changed.
Rome rules the world now.

And one man with a strong
vision must rule Rome.

So power should be wielded
by whom?

The educated? The wealthy?
The aristocrat? By Crassus?

Or by Pompey?

Plato did say that leadership must
be left to the educated.

That leaves Pompey out.
Julius Caesar, you mean.

You've heard what
they say about him.

"Every woman's man and
every man's woman."

But you're right,
Pompey overreaches.

If he's not careful, his head will
be found hanging in the Forum...

just like that of your father
and your brother.

Was it something I said?

This is the Roman short sword...

the Gladius. From which
you get your names.

Twenty-two inches long,
three pounds in weight.

A stabbing weapon
for close work.

You kill a man with this and
you can smell his sweat...

taste his breath.

But you sons of whores...

aren't worthy of fighting
with the Gladius yet.

So you will use...

these wooden swords
while I teach you.

You, slave.

Pick it up.

Come at me.

Again.

Too slow, slave.
Pick it up.

Too slow.

Cinna!

So what do you think of our
new Thracian slaves? Good, huh?

They have spirit,
but no real talent.

I see. So you think
they're just very lucky?

And Cinna...

this boy was very expensive.

Don't damage my property.

Enough! Go! Bring her.

Come.

Come here.

Very good.

Better.

Come.

Let me smell your hair.

You know...

I can be a very good master.

Oh, yes. Now, now...

now kiss me.
No! No!

Hold her!

Hey, Spartacus.

How's your nose?
You got lucky.

Do I have to break it again?

So where did you fight Romans?
Thrace.

You?
Gaul, where I was caught.

And then later in Sicily
where slaves rebelled.

You rebelled?
Two times.

The Romans were terrified of us.
They still are.

Now they kill a man just
for talking about it.

Why did it fail?

Fighting Romans is like
fighting a grist mill.

The stone keeps on turning.

No matter how many times
you attack it in the end...

it grinds you down to dust.

Faster!

Put your backs into it,
you sons of whores!

Why do Africans use
the spear and the net?

I amuses the Romans to turn us
into fishermen.

I was a farmer. I never saw a net
until I came here.

Nordo, this man is trouble.
Leave him be.

In the ring, Draba, they ever pit
the knife against the spear?

The spear always wins.

Enough talking! Back to work.

Well, move, you scum!

Put your body behind the blow!

Good, Draba! Push him back.

Faster!

Harder! Are you men
or are you women?

Tomorrow some of you
have the honor...

of fighting in the arena
in Capua.

Nothing matters but that you
fight well and with courage.

Do this and even the defeated
may receive mercy.

However if that
is not your fate...

then the crowd will expect you
to meet your death honorably...

in the Roman manner,
like this.

Spartacus, kneel.

A defeated gladiator may
beg for mercy...

by raising his hand thus.

The death blow is delivered in a
single thrust to the neck...

here.

That is how a gladiator from the
house of Batiatus dies.

What's the matter, Thracian?
Lost your appetite? Eat. Drink.

Tomorrow we die.
I'm not dying tomorrow.

The gods decide when we die.

I don't believe in the gods.
You don't believe in the gods?

When I look at the heavens
I see only stars.

Blasphemer! You could be
struck down for that.

No bolt of lightning.

So what do you believe in?
Us.

Our will.

We decide when
we die and how.

Well, eat anyway. You'll need
your strength for tonight.

What happens tonight?
War, little Thracian.

Sweet war!

Quiet! Sit down!

A little wisdom.

A man is no good in the
arena if his parts shrivel up.

A gladiator is not
a litter slave.

He is a man.
Yeah!

And a man needs a woman.

Quiet, quiet.

For those of you
who fight tomorrow...

I graciously lend you
these lovelies.

Use them well.
And in the morning...

show me what men
you are. Cinna!

This is yours.

Idiot!
David doesn't fight tomorrow.

Crixus.

You like to play rough,
Thracian. Here.

Batiatus asks that she be
made more pliant.

See to it.

I'm Spartacus.

What are you called?

You look cold. Here.

The stones are cold at night.

You sleep there.
I won't bother you.

Wake up, you sons of whores!

Move already!

My name is Varinia.

Varinia.

Come out, now.

Today you are expected
to bring honor...

to the house of Batiatus.

Fail to do so and you will curse
the day you were born.

Where are they going?
Capua.

They fight today.

The Thracian, the one they call
Spartacus. Is he any good?

Couldn't say.
He's different, though.

How?

All the gladiators here are
strong men. Brave.

But they are still slaves.
They accept it. Not him.

He will not last long.

You were with him last night?

Yes and no.
You, girl!

Come here.

You will attend me
at the games.

But if you give me
any trouble...

I promise that our previous meeting
will feel like a mother's caress.

Now, go and get yourself
cleaned up.

Line up!

I appreciate your contribution
to my games, Batiatus.

Few people understand the financial
burden I'm expected to shoulder...

while on duty in these
dreary provinces.

Thank you. And I appreciate
the loan of your troops.

Security at an establishment
like mine...

does not come cheaply either.

One hand washes the other.
Of course. More wine!

A perfectly ripened pear.

Although somewhat bruised.
A problem with discipline.

But we're working on it.
Aren't we?

Yes, my Lord.

On the crosses. Who are they?
Arsonists.

They wear the tunica molesta,
soaked in pitch.

Change your mind
about the gods?

If there are gods
in this world...

they're not here.

Burn! Burn!

Crixus verses Gaius.

Gannicus verses Antonius.

Spartacus verses Commodus.

This new gladiator, Spartacus,
is he really a Thracian...

or are you still
passing off Greeks?

He's the real thing,
through and through.

Any good?

Cinna thinks the world of him.
Don't you, Cinna?

Very well. A thousand
on Spartacus.

Kill! Kill!

Kill! Kill!

Are you hurt?

I thought in the mines I'd seen
man at his worst.

I was wrong.

A slave has no choice.
Not me.

The ones who watched, took their
pleasure in blood and death.

Good move, Thrace!

Harder! Faster!
Put your back to it!

Can't you lay with me,
Spartacus?

Is it because Cinna ordered it?
Because Cinna ordered it.

And Thracian men and women
are to remain chaste...

until they're married.

Slaves don't marry.
I would marry you.

Marriage requires a holy man.

I thought you didn't believe
in the gods.

I believe in what I can see,
hear and touch.

My tribe believes that man
was created by the gods.

That they live in us.
We're flesh and blood, that's all.

That is what an animal is. The
Romans say that we're animals.

That we are without souls.

But you are afraid to say
that you agree with the Romans.

I believe that I never met anyone
like you, Varinia of Gaul...

and that I love you.

Will you marry me?

On what would you make a vow?
On the blood that flows...

through my veins
and the breath I take...

I will be yours until
the day I die...

and in my life there'll be no other
but you, I swear.

On the blood that flows
in my veins...

and the breath I take...

I will be yours...
Until the day...

Until the day I die.

And in the life beyond.

Can you tell there's life after?
I have faith.

There will be no other man
but you.

I swear.

Kill! Kill!

Kill! Kill!

Spartacus!

Master, we have visitors,
Master, from Rome.

Cornelius Lucius and his wife,
Helena. And Marcus Crassus.

Marcus Crassus is here...

and you left him
waiting outside?

Noble Crassus. You do me
a great honor, sir.

I am Lentulus Batiatus.
Please, sit.

I and my establishment are here
to serve you.

Some wine to wash away
the dust...

and some honeyed ice,
perhaps.

Yes?

How may I serve you?
My friends and I'd appreciate...

a private showing
of a pair of Thracians.

Excellent choice. Your Honor
is obviously a connoisseur.

To the death.
To the death?

That's an unusual request
for a private showing.

I see that you're joking.
That's very good.

Very amusing.
I am not laughing.

Of course you're not.
Well, you've asked for Thracians.

That means you must want
good dagger work.

And I have the best
in the world.

But if you want to the death,
you won't see nuance...

and you won't see subtlety.

Certainly won't see quality.
Madame.

I'm not a butcher, sir,
I am an artist.

Yes.
I want to give you good fighting.

Good fighting.
And to the death.

I want to see courage.

I want to see passion.
And above all...

I want to see finality.

But to the death
will cost you...

Twenty-five thousand denarii.
My God...

you could by an elephant
for that.

Done.

And I want no fakery.

No double cut for them to both suck
the sand and pretend they're dying.

If one of them is down,
or if both of them are down...

I want one of your trainers
to cut their throats.

And they are to
understand that.

Now, I shall leave ten thousand
on account...

and the rest when we
have been satisfied.

Note the Africans.

Theirs is the finest combat and the
most skillful but it can be a bore.

It can go on and on.

To see fighting at its best you
must see Thracians.

Don't you agree, slave master?
But each kind has its virtues.

Change of plan.

Match me a Thracian
against a black.

With all due respect, my Lord,
that is no match.

A Thracian only has a dagger. And
when it's in the net he's finished.

Yes, perhaps. But...

Africans aren't noted
for their strategic thinking.

Hannibal, of course,
being the exception.

I want to see how long...

a mentally superior but
lesser armed man can last.

My Lord, that sort
of experimentation...

makes for bad blood
with the men.

Well, for twenty-five thousand
denarii...

I think you can afford to
incur a little bad blood.

Order!

What is it? What is it?

A private fight.

Who do you want?
Draba.

And David.

Now, he's a Jew, yes?

Yes, I know you want a Thracian...
No, no.

This is interesting.
Ever seen a Jew fight?

Exceptional with the dagger and
reputed to be very bright as well.

Who else?

Spartacus and Polymus.

Spartacus?

How do you like them?

All. Except that one.

I don't like him.

Forgive me, lady,
but that man...

has been in the ring twelve times.
He's very good, strong and quick.

Who will you match him with?
With the African.

What are you doing?
Praying.

How do you pray?

I can show you.

Will you do something for me?

Something that
we do in our tribe?

Put your mouth on mine and
breath your soul into me...

and I'll breath mine
into you.

And then for all time our
souls will be one.

One soul in two bodies.

I will come back to you.

If you don't,
I will kill you myself.

You have to save your strength
for tomorrow.

I am full of strength.

Dagger against net and trident.
What kind of match is that?

Time.

Time!

What are they thinking,
I wonder?

Gladiators are animals,
pure and simple.

If one thinks of them as people,
one loses all perspective.

Is it true what they say about the
Jews? How they mutilate their boys?

Would you like to see?

Bring me the Jew
before he fights.

Bring the Jew here.

The rest of you,
to the House of Expectation.

Unclothe.

Unclothe.

They do that to their children?

How beastly.

Perhaps that explains their much
vaunted skill with the knife.

I want the Jew to fight first.
Of course, sir.

Strike!
Kill him! Kill him!

Kill him!
Kill him, Jew!

Why doesn't he kill him?

Kill him!

Why doesn't he finish him?

Don't expect mercy from me
out there, Thracian.

Live, Draba.

That's what life is for.

If the gods love you...

you die in childhood.

That was extraordinary.

If the second pair is as good as
the first, I shall be well pleased.

Strike!

Kill him!
Kill him!

Kill him!
Kill him!

Kill him!
Kill him!

Kill him!

Stop him!

Why didn't he kill me?

If he kills me, he lives.

If he turns on
the Romans, he dies.

He chooses to die.

Who chooses to die?

Who chooses to die?

Maybe rather than
live as a beast...

Draba chose to die
as a man.

Father!

It was just a dream.

No.

I slept until now.

Now I wake.

Move, you dogs!

Move! I said move!

Move, you scum!

Is it true that Draba didn't kill
any of the Romans?

If a man throw his life away...

he could die better than that.
Will you die any better?

He will die like a dog, and so
will you. So will we all.

Are you my friend, Crixus?

Was Draba your friend?
Yes. And my teacher.

Did he teach you how to die?
He taught me how to live.

I feed you the best food.
I give you women.

You live here like kings
in idleness...

on the fat of the land.

And all I expect is your loyalty
and obedience.

And what do I get in return?

Treachery.

Cinna, fetch me a black man.

Kill him.

Now there will be
no more trouble.

The dogs won't even growl.

Move it, move it! You cows!

Move, slaves!

Are we dogs that you snap
your whips at us?

Spartacus! Prepare to die!
Cinna!

What the hell is going on
out there?

There's too many!

You taught me well, Cinna.

Quiet!

Quiet!
Let him speak!

Quiet! Listen to Spartacus!

Like you...

I've been alone
my whole life.

We could never look
into each other's eyes.

Living like animals.

Here is the lesson of Draba.

I will be a man.

My life is my brother's.

Live to fight the Romans!

Smash the gates!

Master! The gladiators!

They have revolted!

Well, don't just stand there like
a drooling idiot. Help me!

Field formation!

Go get my litter.
We have to get to Capua.

To the garrison. Go!

Hold your positions!

Free men and women, listen to me!
We must get ready.

Nordo, can you open the armory?

Lf I have to do it with my teeth.
Spartacus, look.

David, go.

Go. Talk to them.

What do you want me to say?

Invite our brothers to join us.

Gifts! I bring gifts!

Freedom for you and your children!
Come, join us!

Freedom for you!
Join us!

Spartacus always said that you
would speak some day.

David, Varinia.

Come.
You'll tell me later.

There's one more thing
I need to do.

Maecenus! Maecenus!

Thank you, thank you.
You've got to stop them.

Where's that slaves headed?
In the hills to the south of here.

There's a lot of valuable property.
You've got to save something.

Too late for that. Double time!
March!

Please.

Please.

Let's go.
Look. They're so arrogant...

they've lost their formation.
So?

So if attacked, they'd have
to fight, man to man.

And who fights better man to man
than gladiators?

Crixus, Nordo.

We have guests.

Should we not greet them?

Apparently there has been an
uprising of gladiators in Capua.

The entire garrison
has been slain...

the slaves have taken
to the hills...

where their revolt spreads.
This is what I'm talking about...

why we need strong leadership.

I propose that we send
the city cohorts...

to crush this rebellion.

The entire garrison of Rome?

Are you out of your mind?
To fight slaves?

How many of these creatures
are there? Who are they led by?

It sounds like a job for an
overseer and a pack of dogs.

They massacred the entire
Capua garrison.

The garrison at Capua.

Forgive my bluntness, but an effete
band of pretend soldiers.

A slave rebellion is never
a simple affair.

We all remember Sicily.
Twice the slaves...

attacked. The second time they
seized the entire island...

for over a year! This particular
revolt is taking place...

a mere one hundred miles from
where we now sit and squabble.

So are you suggesting that we
recall a legion from the frontier?

Pompey, perhaps?
And wait weeks for him to arrive?

Will the slaves wait?
I don't think so.

We must deal with this matter
promptly before it gets out of hand.

But the entire city cohorts?
Three.

Three full cohorts.
Under whose command?

I realize that it is not customary
for a man to put his own name.

Then please do not
break precedent.

I was about to suggest...

that the cohorts be sent
under the able command...

of Titus Glabrus.

My Lord, I hardly know
what to say.

Thank you for your
confidence in me.

If it is the will of the Senate and
the people of Rome, then I accept.

If it is indeed the will
of the Senate...

then Titus Glabrus go with
our blessings.

Fall upon this rabble
with all the weight...

and majesty of Roman law.

We will march
across the world...

and turn it over,
stone by stone!

Look at them.

They think the war is all won.
It hasn't even started.

How are we going to feed
them or clothe them...

much less train them
to fight the Roman Empire?

By teaching them to share
the burden.

Like free men.

Why did you propose Glabrus?
He's as thick as he is vain.

But politically dependable.
Why don't put yourself forward?

Agrippa would have blocked me
out of sheer spite.

Besides there's little honor
in defeating slaves...

and terrible shame
if one fails.

If Glabrus succeeds...

a minor rebellion is put down
and he owes me a favor.

And if he fails the whole city
will be panicked.

And the Senate will
embrace the wisdom...

of a more permanent system
of leadership.

Fear isn't a bad thing, Caius.

It makes for a more
malleable electorate.

Crassus says he wants
to be Consul...

in order to restore the former
glory of Rome.

But he wants to transform
the Consul...

into a more permanent position.
Emperor.

The day that Crassus
becomes Consul...

is the day the
Roman Republic dies.

The time has come to make
some decisions.

We must leave?
And to where?

I want to go home.
Everywhere is the same as here.

Everywhere it is master
and slave.

I go where I go.

No man tells Crixus
what to do anymore.

Come down, Crixus.

This is Crixus the Gaul.

Maybe the strongest man
among us.

But still, he's only
one man.

Can you bend this?

Now all of these.

We are like the arrows.

Separately we're weak.

But together we're invincible.

And that's why the Romans worked
so hard to divide us...

tribe by tribe and
country by country.

We're one tribe then?
Yes!

Is that your will?
Yes!

Who will lead us?

Stand up if you want to lead.

Spartacus.

Spartacus!
Spartacus!

Spartacus!
Spartacus!

If that is your wish.

And so one man doesn't
become a tyrant...

we need laws.

What are they?
Whatever we take...

we hold together.

No man should own anything
but his own weapon.

We'll be rich with the gold taken.
We'll make the Romans our slaves!

Yeah!
I will not be a slave owner!

Slavery is an evil.

An evil that turns
all men slaves...

and slave masters into animals.

There will be equality and justice
between both man and woman.

We're one tribe then?
Yes.

One people?
Yes!

Is that your will?

It is my will.

It is my will.
It is my will.

It is my will.

Then this is what we'll do.

We'll go from plantation
to plantation...

from house to house...

free the slaves, and fight anyone
who tries to stop us.

And we'll make
an end to Rome...

and build a new world where
there'll be no slaves or masters!

What is going on up there?
Some plantation...

is burning the stubble
of a field.

There's too much smoke
for that.

There's a forest fire
or something.

Tell them to go faster.

Helena!
Faster!

Why are you stopping?
What is the meaning of this?

Whoever you are...

you are blocking the path
of a citizen of Rome.

Move out of the way.

Pick up your litters!

Pick up your litters!

Pick up your litters!

Glabrus wishes us to know...

that while he hasn't
encountered the brigands...

evidence of their
atrocities is everywhere.

"A slave who doesn't join
their ranks is put to the sword...

and any Roman unfortunate
enough to encounter them...

meets a fate worse than death.

It's with great regret that I
report the murders...

of numerous nobles
including Cornelius Lucius...

and his wife Helena."

Helena and Cornelius Lucius?

Are you sure?
That is what it says.

"The rebels' leader
is Spartacus...

a gladiator from Thrace.

He has led them
to Mt. Vesuvius.

It is there that I intend
to trap and dispose of them.

Rest assured I am mindful
that I carry in my hands...

the glory and majesty
that is Rome.

Titus Glabrus."

So we're to be equals, are we?
Does that trouble you?

Well, I'll do what I can to raise
myself, but I make no promises.

You better. A child needs a father
it can look up to.

A child?
We're going to have a child?

The slave army's climbing the north
wall of the mountain, my Lord.

A little less liberal use of the
term 'army', if you don't mind.

Sorry, my Lord.
We'll camp here for tonight.

Why don't we push on, my Lord?

Cut off the slaves before they
reach the mountains.

It's cold, I'm tired and I'm
hungry. We'll camp here.

I like it.
It's light but it's strong.

Spartacus, we need to talk.

This is a war council.

What's a woman doing here?
She has every right to be here.

Do women lead your armies?
Is that why Jews...

squirm under the Roman thumb?
What's the excuse of the Gauls?

David has news for us.

Three cohorts of Roman soldiers
have taken a position...

on the road below us.
We're trapped.

They're so confident they haven't
even built a stockade.

Fifteen hundred men.

I knew this would happen,
Thracian, but you insisted.

"The people are tired.
They need rest."

Well, the dead rest forever.

You must've known
they'd follow us here.

How do we get off
this mountain?

What's your plan?

I don't have one.
You don't have a plan?

From the moment I stood up
in the training yard...

I've only thought as far ahead
as the next move.

You must have an idea.
Why must I?

I'm no different from
any of you.

Isn't that the point?
That we're all equal?

Yes, but...
So one of you figure it out!

He'll be fine.

They chose you as their leader.
I didn't ask for that honor.

No, but you didn't
decline it either.

And why should you?
You're the only possible choice.

But now the time to lead has come.
When I was alone...

all I had to lose was my own life.

Now I have the lives
of hundreds.

Your life.
Our child's.

I have faith you'll find answers.
Where?

Within the soul you say I have?
Yes.

You may not have chosen this
moment, Spartacus.

But it seems that this moment
has chosen you.

My Lord, is it true you've given
the troops permission to camp...

without building the usual
defensive fortifications?

The men are tired
and I am tired.

When a Roman army bivouacs it is
customary to build a fort.

It's just a handful of slaves...

facing the same miserable
conditions we are.

With women and children and one
tenth of our equipment.

A little while ago some of you
were asking me if I had a plan.

And the plan is this.
We will attack first.

David, hold your men outside the
camp until you hear my cry...

and then charge in like
the gods of hell.

If these don't hold,
I'll kill you myself.

If these don't hold, you won't have
to kill me. We'll all be dead.

You can tell us now.

You are safe here.

I was asleep.

I woke up to screaming.

The sound of screaming.

I was screaming.

Their men were everywhere,
like ravenous beasts.

And their women followed, feeding
like harpies on the wounded.

The killing went on and on.

At the end our men threw down the
weapons and plead for their lives...

but there was no mercy.
How is it that you were spared?

I don't know why they chose me.

All I know is I was brought
before their leader.

My name is Spartacus. I have a
message for your Senate.

Tell them that we, the slaves...

say the Roman way
is corrupt and dead.

We want nothing from you.
Leave us alone.

But if you come
after us again...

we will destroy you all.
