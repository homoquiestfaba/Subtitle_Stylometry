[slow music]

Come on.

All right, stop.

Throw it on the scale.
I'll be there

about six o'clock if you
wanna bring the cars over.

I won't have time to break them
down for parts today, okay.

I'll pull them

to the weigh station
There you go.

and I'll have one
of my boys come out.

And I'll talk to you soon.

There you go.
Thanks man.

Is that it?

that's the new price.

Fuck, man, we brought in
more than this last week, Hark.

Okay, well, you
can take your cans

and you can go to
another junk yard.

me are behind on the rent.

Well, then start
bringing in more pop cans.

All right, thanks.

[Hark chuckles]

[President Trump On radio]
We're going to bring jobs

to Ohio.

It can be summed up in
three very beautiful words,

jobs, jobs, jobs.

[Woman On intercom]
Maintenance to line four

for repairs, maintenance
to line four.

[machinery running]

[assembly line running]

[sirens blaring]

[Linda laughs]

Well, oh, hey.
Hey there.

How goes, Linda?
Oh you know

Morning.
Making the money, honey.

Hey, stop by my house later, I
put the old washer on the porch,

it should be worth something.

Yes, ma'am.

Here eat this, eat this and
you got your thermos, right.

I'll eat the pretzels.

Hey beautiful.
My feet are killing me.

You sell a lot this morning?
Yeah, a little bit.

Hey Tonya, my smokes.
You said I could have one.

Yeah, one, not chow
down on my menthols

like a goddamn snack pack.

Can you believe this girl.

Shit.

I heard Phil talking to
management the other day.

Oh don't go getting
rumor mill started, Levi.

Seems like this overseas
company's buying up.

You did not hear that.

Last thing I need to do
is go in front of a judge

and have to explain why I
can't pay my child support.

so many goddamn kids then.

can bury me with this place.

buried in this place.

What?
Nothing.

Blaze, I'm gonna be late.

Okay.

his test to work here yet?

He's studying for it.

I miss having your
mom around here.

I got them to keep
her at the county jail

until she agrees to rehab.

Thank you.
Uh-huh.

You oughta think about
putting an application in here.

Don't listen to him.

Have you always been
a grumpy bitch, Linda?

Yeah, you bring
out in me, Levi,

just like my second husband.

[siren blares]

Hey, tell Rhonda that everybody
here is rooting for her.

Thank you, Linda.
Okay.

Thanks, Linda.
Bye, baby.

See you around, let's go.
You guys be good.

Yep.
Dude, she's nasty.

No, she's not, don't
start, Ruth, seriously.

did you just say about me?

She's fucked
everyone on third shift

that's why she's back on third.

you're better than me?

You blew a cop for
a set of acrylics.

hey go.

Well, you think

you're better than me, why don't you
come here and say that to my face?

I'll call you.

Goddamn it, Ruth.
Fucking bitch.

Anything?
What?

It looks like
a paternity test.


It's got your name on it.

Let me see.

The mail is not
here yet, it's old,

you gotta wrap it up, bro.
All right, thanks, smart-ass.

Hey, Crystal.

I really need
that take home test.

I know, I got you,
I'm gonna go inside.

Hey, Bella.

I'll just swing by
later and get it then.

Okay, see you.
All right, bye.

[slow music]

[water boiling]

[girl knocks]

Hey.
Hey.

[indistinct] up.
Here's that.

Thank you.

Hi, Bella, hi.

[baby coos]

[baby cries]

This is some smart shit.

How many credits
do you have left?

Just this one class
and then the high school

mails the diploma but
like I really need algebra

to work line four.

No, no, I don't
need any money.

No, it's from Mom's purse,
seriously, here take it.

Thank you.

I miss you at school.
Yeah, yeah.

[baby coos]

See you next week.
See you next week.

Pleasure doing business.
Later.

[slow music]

[school bell rings]

Show me the bag.
Why?

Open the bag, Ruth.
Don't touch my bag!

Get off me!
Miss Avery!

one last week too.

me check them out.

Because you have
bad attendance.

Six times she's been to the
resource officer this year.

If I was one of
your football players,

we wouldn't have
this conversation.

It's because I'm an Avery.

Ruth, we believe you
could be anything you want.

Well, I don't wanna
be in this room anymore,

so can I be that?

Hands on the wall.

You don't have permission
to put me in here,

you have to have permission.

What am I supposed to do?

[slow music]

[Police woman] Come on out,

Mom will be thrilled
you're on time today.

You gave them permission?
Yep.

Come on back.

Hi, you look tired.

I feel tired, I've
been working all day.

You look it.

What, I don't get nothing?

You seeing anyone?
No, just talking.

Just talking.
Hmm-mm.

Hmm-mm, you better
be just talking.

I don't want you to go
knocking up a factory girl

and making a grandma out of
me while I'm in this place.

You can always
go to the clinic.

I wanna be in my own bed.

Rehabs are all
full right now, Mom,

you know, you just gotta
stay positive, that's all.

I'm positive, I'm a positive
person, are you positive?

Yeah, I'm positive, yeah.

Linda says hi, she was
saying that there's a clinic

down in Florida that
you should check out.

I mean, you might as well
just look at it, Mom,

it's better than
county jail, right?

They found a head about 10
miles from here last week,

a human head, okay,
go find that guy,

put that person in jail,

I'm in here trying to get clean

and everybody thinks
I'm a criminal,

Mom.
and now even my own son

is trying to send me away.

you're a criminal.

If I'm in here they do.

Not half a head, a whole head.

I heard the lesbian
talking about it last week.

Not a lesbian.
You look it.

Mom, stop.

You're awfully quiet.
I've got nothing to say.

I was thinking that
when I get out of here

that I would come back
and stay with you two.


Well, I'll be out in 30
days and I'm clean now so.

Mom.
You should test my piss.

Mom.
Test my piss.

Make the lesbian get
a cup, I'll pee in it.

Mom.

can either go to Florida

or you can stay with Linda at
the end of 30 days, all right,

and that's what
we gotta do, okay?

No, I supposed we don't have
to decide anything right now.

I love you, Mom.
I love you too.

What is this?
Let me see.

Oh my god.
What is it?

Oh my god.

Where is the school?
Hey.

Oh my god.
What?

Oh my fucking god.

Get off me!
You just got into college.

I didn't apply to college.

Oh, what the
hell's your problem?

You going through my
shit, that is my problem.

What, you don't wanna go,

you're living it
up big here, huh?

Why'd you fill out
the whole application

if you didn't wanna go, why'd
you fill out the whole essay

and everything?

It wasn't yours
to turn in, Blaze.

Are you kidding me?
Hey, hey,

keep it down over there!
Hey, but Vick,

Ruthie just got into college.

Well, good for her!
That is so embarrassing.

Keep your fucking voices down!

Why did you fill it out,
if you didn't wanna go?

There's nothing I
can learn in school

that I can't learn here.

You can have a life there.

I have a life here with you.

What life are
you talking about?

I'm watching you!

Vicki, if you
got into college,

would you be living here?

Shut the hell up!

Jesus Christ, Vicki, you can
have your full conversation

in the house.

You don't have to,
I'm on the phone,

you can have it inside,
mind your own business!

you don't have to stand
out on the goddamn porch!

Jesus Christ, Vicki, all
right, have a great evening.

Ruth, hey.

Water's still off.

Yeah, 'cause I shelled out
$75 bucks for this application,

that's some life here, huh?

I had to call the school

and beg them to take
this thing late.

You should have heard
me over the phone.

Don't blame Ruth for
her stupid brother.

If I wanted to turn it in,
I would have turned it in,

mind your own business.

You are my, legally,
you are my business, Ruth.

Goddamn it.

[slow music]

Get in.

You can't get gas money
out of [indistinct].

Ruth, you got
in, you're going.

We can't afford it.

What are you doing?

Really in broad daylight?

Be more than gas money, right?

Hey!

Are you planning on
selling me my own scrap?

Yeah, so.
Yeah, so.

You're not paying us enough.
Ruth.

We got no water,
it's not enough.

That sounds like
you're calling me cheap.

Yeah.

You two follow me.

So how much you looking to make?

More than $50.
I like her.

You know I get a few
construction gigs here and there

but no one's hiring.
I need extra scrap

but it's not raccoon's, okay.

Yeah, we're more than cans
and bottles, sweetheart,

you gotta, have you
looked around this town?

Manufacturing is drying
up left and right,

leaving behind old dozers
that's rotting away.

We scrap the metal and
we sell it to China

straight from the yard.

I'm talking modern
day gold bonds.

Seven grand a month
between the two of you.

Sounds illegal.

Well, you didn't have a
problem with that a minute ago,

did you?

We'll think about it.

[slow music]

All right, drop, like
I told you, good job.

Come on back now.

Hey, what are you doing here?

Hark brought us
on, is he around?

You too, sweetheart?

I'm here to work.

He's inside.
All right.

Oh, hey.
Hey.

You made it.
Yeah.

Nice place.
Got a little something for you.

Hey, cheers.

Cheers.
Thanks, man.

That's-
This all you?

Yeah, this is all
me, that's Willie.

Willie!

Come on, come on.

Ah, there we go, come on.

Good boy, come on.

Holy hell, that's pretty nice.

This is it.

Yeah, my house is your house.
All right.

Why don't you
follow me back here.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Willie, sit.
Here you go.

Will he get sick?
He misses every now and then.

No, he doesn't, he's
there we go, good boy.

This is my crossbow too.

Oh yeah, get out of here.
Oh yeah, feel it.

Oh, shit.
Heavy huh?

serious damage with this.

Yeah, I'll teach
you how to use it

one of these days.
Yeah, all right.

the same thing to me.

man, you play a lot of games?


[Hark laughs]

Well, this is where it
happens, where we hang out.

You guys like it?

It's perfect, man.

[Hark laughs]

Come check this out.
All right.

So, yeah, this is it.
Yeah.

And, oh, you know what tomorrow
I got a buyer coming down

first thing in the morning,
so if you guys want to come and work or...

Yeah, of course,
yeah, thanks, man.

I get another beer.

Yeah, cheers.
Yeah, enjoy.

Thanks.
Yeah.


Think Hark could
let Tonya come over?

Bang your skanky
girlfriend somewhere else.

[Blaze laughs]

We just need the room for
like, I don't know, two hours.

30 minutes.
You jealous?

Oh, you caught me.

Actually, you better not
be bringing anyone over here.

Trust me, talking to
the guys around here

is all the birth control I need.

Good 'cause I'd kill them.

All right, man,
looking nice, oh.

I'm thinking about opening a
bank account for the money,

what do you think?

Whatever you want, Blaze.

All right, an hour, just
an hour, that's all I need.

[Blaze hums]

do you know about

what you're bringing in?

for it, that's about it.


You need to know a
little more than that.


buyers always want copper.

Best kind is electrical wires,

if you're lucky
enough to find it.

Look over here we got
iron and aluminum.

They look the same.

Feel that.

Here feel that.

Which one's heavier?

This one.
Okay, iron.

So, iron's heavier than
aluminum, all right?

This, this is brass, okay.

How do you know it's brass,
it's got yellow in it.

Okay.

This, [chuckles]
this is the good shit.

People Jones for this.

Copper equals money, okay.

Feels good, huh?

So, how long these guys
been working for you?

Well, Pudge came
in after Tigerboy.

Yeah.
I mean,

Tigerboy, they're
scrapping just like you.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

This is the bailer, it's the
heart of the yard right here.

Okay.
And as long

as this thing's running,
we're in business.

All right.

scrawny ass over here!

Why don't you get her
working on the stainless steel

and I'll take you
to the way station

when the buyer comes in.

You're in good hands.

All right, so this is
really simple, actually,

let me see your hands.

You're gonna take your right
one and you're gonna put it

on this grip and
with your left one,

you're gonna have your
thumb over the top

and all your other
fingers on the bottom.

So, like this.

And you're gonna feel a
little lever down there,

you wanna press that
little lever down

and then you wanna squeeze
and that should turn it on.

Yep, just like that.

[machinery running]

[machinery running]

Hey, Hey!

Don't touch the bailer.

So, what can I
do for you, Lee?

I need some copper,
Hark, some steel

and you got any red brass?

Copper's low, it's
been low all year.

Okay, I see you got
some new help around here.

Business is booming,
you know, what can I say?

Nice, nice, all right,
well then in that case

I need 1,000 pounds of steel.

60 cents.
All right

and 700 pounds of
number one wire.

Three dollars.
Three, I can get it

for two bucks down
the road, come on.

Okay, I'm gonna tell you $2.50

and you're gonna say okay.

You know why, because unlike
the guys down the road,

I don't mix number
ones and number twos.

I'll give you $2.25.
$2.50, Lee,

or you can tell
your boss from China

that my good buddies
from Hong Kong

are gonna get the
last bit of copper.

They're coming by
here soon too, so.

more copper next month.

you're my favorite buyer.



Here, add this to the list.

is a good deal, trust me.

No, she's good-

Total's wrong, you
forgot to carry the one.

You're off $5,000.

Blaze, why don't you take
Lee outside for a second.

I'll be out there in a second.


Why don't you fix it.

That's good work.

[slow music]

[Ruth sighs]

So, what did you think?

Man, it's something.


Hey, how did you get to running
your own business anyway?

Well, I was in the
Marines for a few years

and I came back and it was
kind of hard to find a job.

Right.

So, I went down to Mexico

and that's where all
the jobs are going.

So, I'm down there, get a call
saying hey, we got a position

for you, $8.50 an
hour making cabinets.

Come back here, then
those jobs go overseas.

Then I joined up
with a scrap crew,

see how much they're raking in

and I learned the
business real quick.

I broke off, decided
to hire my own people.

You didn't go to college.

[Hark laughs]

No.

I mean, probably thought

of doing something
else though, right?

I mean, like lawyer or music
or police or something.

What, be a broke musician?

Let me tell you something,
hey let me tell you something,

listen to this, the police
when my buyers come into town,

they take them out to dinner.

I don't know, it just
sounds nice to get out

and see how the rest of
the world works is all.

You get a front row seat
to how the world works,

I don't need no professor
of sociology quizzing me

on life below the poverty line.

Well, maybe if
I'd gone to college,

I wouldn't live below
the poverty line.

Look, what I do,
it's not glamorous,

there's not some kid going,

hey, I wanna own a scrap
metal yard when I get older,

it's fucking hard work.

And you know, if you work hard

then maybe one day you
can own a house like me,

you know, you too.

too smart for that.

No, she's smarter
here, trust me.

What does that mean?

It means here at least
you can see the top.

here, it's your turn.

Look, why don't you
guys get yourself a beer

and come out and
play some games.

All right.

Get up.

all over the place

and there's copper
in that conduit.

Move fast, follow the wires.

Look out for other scrappers.

[dramatic music]

Stay with me.

[ominous music]

Hark, get the steel doors.

Here, let's take a look around.

Well, what are
we supposed to do?

you'll figure it out.

Let's figure it out.


Ruth, over here.

Get the grinder.

Are you gonna cut it?
Yeah, start here,

stop right there.
Here?

Yeah.

[machinery running]

Careful.

All right, I'm gonna run
this back to the truck,

are you good here?
Yeah.

Stay here?
Yes.

Is that it?
Yep.


[dramatic music]

[ceiling crashing]

Wow.

I told you there were more
than cans and bottles.

[dramatic music]

[Woman On Radio] I didn't
even know what an engineer was.

All I knew is that I was curiou

and math and problem
solving were fun for me.

By the time I arrived
at college I learned

that it was the engineers
who had those same skills

and were solving
things, important things

like global warming and
medical breakthroughs.

But I was the only
girl in the class

and that's when I learned
that it's hard to-

[Hark] You're up early.

I made coffee.

What are you working on?

There's this paper for school.

Seems like a waste of time.

It better not be,
it's already late.

You know, business
is about people,

can't learn people in books.

Thanks for the advice.

So, let me get this straight,

you're saving up all this money

just to spend it on a place

that's gonna throw
more books at you?

[Hark chuckles]

So, you already
know everything, huh?

Thanks for the coffee.

[bell rings]

I will see you

in the new year.

Everybody enjoy and
be safe out there.

Finals were due last week.

Can you at least read it,
I need this to graduate?

You should have thought
about that last week.

I have to work to earn
money to get into the college

that I wanna go to.
Sit down, Ruth,

have a seat.

Ruth, the reality
of student loan debt

for someone like
you is crushing.

I know this is
disappointing to hear

and I don't want you
to get your hopes up

but when there's a good
IT program in the area

and I know the person
in charge of recruiting

in apprenticeship program, I'd
be glad to make a phone call

for you.

What if I don't
wanna work in IT?

I just think it's more
practical for someone,

a young lady in your situation.

What's with you?
I graduated.

Yeah?

[R&B music]

All right, we're
at this factory

and we're gutting this
fucking thing, all right.

I mean, copper, tons
of copper, right?

The sun's going down.
Hark, do they really need

to hear this story.
Pudge, yes,

now shut up, okay.

Let me start over, we're
scrapping this factory

at Jonesboro.
Uh-huh.

And the sun's coming down,
we're fighting the elements

at this point.

I'm in my truck, I'm
smoking a cigarette

and all of a sudden I see
Tigerboy in the third level

peeking out the window
like Santa Clause,

like he's got a bag over
him but with copper in it.

Boom, he jumps out, he hits
Pudge, Pudge is on the floor

at this point.
Oh.

Right and I'm going, holy
shit, cigarette's down,

I go over there I'm
so worried, right?

I don't know if
cops are gonna come,

I don't know what's
gonna happen.

Uh-huh.

And I start walking over there

and about maybe two or three
feet before I get there,

I smell this,
Hark, stop.

I can almost taste this.

That's not the meat
in this town, right?

[Blaze laughs]

Oh no, man.
He shit his pants!

Oh, no.

You guys.

I mean, it's a good story.

It's kind of a mean story,

I love it.
it's kinda mean.

It's funny, I will
remember that for the rest

of my life.


How you doing?
Hey!

Hey.
You all

ready to get into trouble?
Yes.


I'm ready baby, come on.

I'm gonna go rollerblade.

I'll go if you go.

I'm really good.

[Hark laughs]

Do you want to?

Do you wanna go, I'm
horrible, I'm bad.

[Hark laughs]
[Ruth laughs]

You wanna go skate?

Let's go.

Yep.

â™ª 'Cause there's nothing to it

â™ª You say I'll miss
you day and night â™ª

Ruth!

â™ª I am brighter
than the full moon â™ª

â™ª I'm full of doubts

I'm afraid of the people.

â™ª You say nothing once more â™ª

â™ª Maybe you say all is bright â™ª

â™ª And from me to you
there's only sky â™ª

â™ª An arrow is lodged with a
battle cry with a battle cry â™ª

[machinery running]

[slow music]

Ruth, here, here.

Here let me see this.

Jesus.

[Ruth gasps]

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

Okay.

Oh, use the scissors.
Here.

It would have helped, huh?

Thank you.
Yeah.

There's, bailer, no gloves.

A dumb skillet
fell out of my hand.


Got an electric saw then
this sheet metal factory.

You got anymore?

Getting a knife away from my mom.
Oh.

Sorry.

A little paper cut. [laughs]

Then, appliance factory.



[machinery running]

insurance, my benefits?

Look, I'm sorry.

I don't believe this, 70
hours a week to you people.

I don't make the rules.

You sign the
fucking checks, Phil!

You need to leave
the premises please.

I asked your ass last month if
you were laying people off and-

They laid off Levi.

You said no.

[pounds window]

What are you people looking at?

I'm sorry baby.

All right everybody back to
work, come on show's over.

Get back to work, let's go.

Delete it, I better not
see this on Facebook.


Somebody just lost their job,

ain't nothing funny about that!

You filming him.
Are you mad, man?

I don't see the humor in that.

Blaze.
Catch a ride with Linda.

Why where are you going?

To get a drink, can I have one
fucking minute to myself please.

Blaze.

[sirens blare]

Let's go everybody, I mean it.

You're still on the
clock, especially you.

â™ª And you know
that you hurt me â™ª

â™ª Me sleeping next to
you was the worst thing â™ª

â™ª Always [indistinct] â™ª
[Blaze laughs]

Oh my god.

â™ª Wasn't really working â™ª

â™ª Brought a [indistinct] of
water but you wasn't thirsty â™ª

â™ª You are worst being
knowing that you hurt me â™ª

Cheers, man.
Old factory job.

Here's to it.

â™ª Wasn't the worst. â™ª


shot, are you sure?

[Blaze sighs]

I feel like a king, man.

Oh, there you go.
I feel like a damn king.


[Blaze laughs]

â™ª I don't know why you hurt me

â™ª Now I feel so [indistinct] â™ª

[woman pounds on the door]

Blaze, Blaze, Blaze!

What's she doing here?
I live here.

Shut up, Desiree.
Why do I always

gotta hold the beer?

Because I paid for it.

You still mad at me?

Take this to the kitchen.

â™ª Hurt me â™ª

â™ª Being sleeping next to
you was the worst thing â™ª

[people chatter]

â™ª Wasn't working â™ª

â™ª I brought a [indistinct] of
water but you wasn't thirsty â™ª

â™ª Worst day knowing
that you hurt me â™ª

â™ª [indistinct] the first thing

â™ª [indistinct] wasn't
really working â™ª

Hey, I'm telling you,

we were scraping this
fucking factory, man.

No, we were scraping, we were
gutting the fucking thing

completely, I mean.

and Tigerboy he falls

and Pudge and he hits
Pudge on the way down.

[dramatic guitar music]

â™ª Everybody tries
to make me dance â™ª

â™ª But I just wanted
to sit still â™ª

â™ª Instead I got you with
my strongest gazes â™ª

â™ª And in a sad youthful thrill

10 engine blocks.

No count them again.

Still 10.

I'm taking my break.

[slow music]

[metal clanks]

[ominous music]

[rain pours]

[chain clinking]

Start in the corner.

Okay.

Hey, Pudge.
What's up?

Someone's tools are here.

[loud clammer]

What's that?
Another crew's here.


[man whispers]

[footsteps scuffle]



Hey, hey, don't-
[gun fires]

Shit.

Let's go.
Let's move out of here!

[engine revs]
[tires squeal]

[ominous music]

Ruth, Ruth, you okay?

Fuck, fuck, he's
bleeding out, man, shit.

All right get him
locked around his legs.

doing, you can't move him?

Come on.
You can't move him,

you have to call somebody.

We're not calling
anyone, all right!

You have to call somebody,
he needs an ambulance.

No, we're putting him
in the truck.

Come on.

Ruth.
Stop, moving,

stop.
Stop!

Someone just shot him,
Hark, somebody shot him.

He's not breathing, man.

Why are you
putting him in here?

Why are you putting him in here,

you need to call an ambulance!

Hey, come on, come on,
Get off me!

come on, come on, come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

Get off!

Come on.
Hark, Hark!

[engine revs]

[engine revs]

I took him to the
hospital, he didn't make it.

What about the police?

The police asks questions so.

Yeah, like who shot him,
why you didn't call him?

Look, Ruth, look, you
wanna get the police involved

around here, if that
what you wanna do,

you can kiss your
paycheck goodbye.

I thought you and the
police were really tight?

Ruth, stop, enough.

No, you know what, no, no,
go ahead, go ahead call them.

Okay.

[Hark laughs]

Yeah, you stay in the
town 'cause you're scared,

scared to call them,
scared to leave.

You stay here
'cause you're weak.

What the fuck did you say?
She didn't mean it, man.

Yeah, I did mean it.
Yeah, okay, you wanna repeat that again?

You stay here because you're weak.
Get out, get the fuck out!

All right, all right.

Get out, no get
off my property!

Did I stutter, I said get out.

Let me talk to
her, hey Ruth, hey.

Rather worth lying for
and then die over scrap.

We can't leave, Ruth,
we don't have enough.

Do you understand?

If we leave now, then all
of this was for nothing.

It could have been you.

I'm not leaving.

If you wanna go, you
can go, I'm not leaving,

'cause there ain't nothing
else out there for me.

[Ruth cries]

I'm really sick of
being the only one

who gives a shit
about you, Ruth.

Hey.

Can I stay with
you for awhile?

[ax hammers]

Okay.

Yeah, that'll take longer.

Good, good job.

[Blaze knocks]

I'm sorry, all right.

break room three, please report

any remaining employees will
clear the floor immediately.

You've known me
for how long now,

just let me in for five minutes.

Linda, what's going on?

They closed us down.

Jesus, already?

They wouldn't even let me
get the stuff out of my locker.

Sorry, honey.

Wait, you're leaving?

Yeah, I've seen about enough.

Asshole.

All right, everybody call me,
let me know how you're doing.

[woman cries]

Write if you get work, right.

Sorry, sorry baby.

Sorry guys.

remaining employees

must clear the
floor immediately.

Blaze!

Don't stay there with him.

I'm not quitting, we've
got enough deadbeats

in this family.

Come on back guys.


This is a surprise.

The plant closed.

When today?
Today, now it's gone.

Oh, crooks, all of them.

They did the same thing to me.

Mom.

Well, you'll
find something else

and Ruth will pick
up somewhere else.

She's going to school, Mom.

She already goes to school.
She's going to college.

We're not college people.
Why not?

Why not?

You get into a smart school
and you ask a stupid question

like why not.

I'm not asking you for
money, so I'm not asking you

for your opinion anyway.

Well how do you expect me to pay
them, in cigarettes, 'cause I can't

I wouldn't expect

get it in here either.
you to pay.

Shut up, please, please,
shut up, please, both of you.

[Blaze groans]

Well, I hope
Linda's holding up,

I know how demoralizing
those layoffs can be.

You weren't laid
off you were fired

because you showed
up high everyday.

I got laid off.
Ruth, go sit in my truck.

Go, right now!
You go along with whatever

narrative you want
Go right now!

Go, please go, Mom.
but it's all a lie.

So, you're gonna leave just like that?
Mom.

No, no, no, how
could you leave

after everything that your
brother has done for you?

Please go, go.

Oh, man, I have no
idea what I'm doing.

[slow music]

[engine starts]

[slow music]

You shouldn't be here.

He's making you work late.

Overtime.

There's a training
program in town.

We can do that together

or we can ride there
together everyday.

I'm not smart like you, okay?

I mean, I didn't
finish my senior year

'cause somebody had
to take care of you

and now I'm here
and I don't know.

Why don't you leave, Ruth,
just take my keys and go?

I don't leave because
I don't wanna leave you.

[President Trump] We want every child
in America to have the opportunity

to climb the ladder to success.

'Cause we can never lose
sight of the connection-

There's a prison guard
position over in Mansfield.

Where the hell is Mansfield?

Don't you have a pension?
Well, sure I do.

Then retire.
I wanna work.

about the other scrap crews?

I don't.

Well do you know
where I can find them?

No, Hark is bad enough,

a girl like you doesn't need

to be running around
with them men.

I mean, you know,
I'm not slow, honey,

I know what you've been doing.

I can't scrap it by myself.

All right, listen to me,
Blaze has his hands full

with your mom, he doesn't-

My mom is a junkie,
that was her choice,

it was not gonna be mine.

It's not a choice.

When your mom hurt
her hand on the job,

she couldn't find
work anywhere else.

She was a hard worker.

That damn doctor kept
prescribing her pain pills.

You gonna help
me scrap it or not?

[dramatic music]

[machinery running]

[ominous music]

[machinery running]

Ha.

[Linda chuckles]

Yes.

[dramatic music]

[metal clanking]

Yeah.

Hey, why weren't
you at work today!

Hey, man, I don't want
any trouble, all right,

I'm just checking on my sister.

Oh, you don't
want any trouble?

You know Lee called
me and told me

that your sister is
selling him sheet metal.

Did you know that?

I don't know anything
about that, all right.

I don't want any trouble.

No, I know, I know, you
already fucking said that,

so I'm gonna ask
again where is she?

It's just me, man.

When I find her,
I'll let you know.

Don't you fucking
walk away from me.

I'm gonna ask you again,
where is your sister?

I literally just got
here, Hark, all right?

Okay, did you know
someone came into my office?

Did you know that?

I wasn't in your
fucking office, man.

You know, I bring you
guys on, I bring you money.

Someone died on
your watch, Hark,

it could have been
any one of us.

Okay, I'm done, okay,
that's everything I made

in the last two weeks.

Get that out of my face,

don't fucking put
that in my face.

I'm fucking done man.
[Hark punches Blaze]

[Blaze grunts]

[ominous music]

You can do this, come on.

Right to the sofa,
come on, baby.

Oh shit, all right, all right,
careful, careful, careful.

Let me get a towel.
Let me lift your legs.

Shit.

Go get me some washcloths.

Hurry, sweetie.

[Ruth cries]

Breath, breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe.

You got it, you got it.

I got them.

Keep cleaning him up.
Okay.

report an assault.

Yeah, it's my best friend's son

I found him in the back
alley, beat up pretty bad.

Okay, okay, I'll meet
you at the hospital.

[ominous music]

[metal crashes]

[metal crashes]

[dramatic music]

[machinery runs]

[metal crashes]

[slow music]

[slow music]

The police say they
don't know who did it

but I know who did it, so
they must know who did it,

it's such bullshit, right.

But I will come
back tomorrow, okay?

Thank you pal.
Sure, bye.

Hey, huh?
How dare you.

All right, Rhonda,
you don't need

to talk to her like that.

Linda, this is
a family matter.

Yeah, and I'm about the
only family you got left

so shut up.

If you can't find it
in you to be decent

to your daughter right now,

I'm not gonna come
visit you anymore.

Bye.

Thanks for the picture.

They won't let me visit him.

Mom.

I know, I know.

[slow music]

You're really not gonna go
back inside and see her?

Make her sweat
it out a little.

You need a ride?
No, I'm good.

Thanks, Linda.

Bye baby.

[slow music]

we're gonna call it?

What's that?
Tom-Tom.

You like that?
Yeah, where'd you come up with that?

Oh, yeah, very funny.

Blue looks darker
than normal blue.

Hey.
Hey.

Hey.

I'm gonna.
Yeah.

How do I look?
Really scary.

Yeah.

Mom called, she
said you stopped by.

For a little bit.

Come here.

An apartment next
to Tonya opened up,

I told her we'll check
it out next week.

Okay.
Yeah.

That's good.

You want applesauce?
You want me to feed you?

I wanna feed you.

[Blaze chuckles]

That's too much.

No, it's not.
Yes it is.

Gotta get your
strength up, hmm.

Hmm. [chuckles]
