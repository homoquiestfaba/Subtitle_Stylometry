What?

Thank you.

Hey, are you okay?

Not cool.

I told you I can cry on command.

It's not funny.

It's kind of funny.

All right, let's go.

Okay, fine.

of control in everyone

So wait.

So this is not your childhood home though.

No.

No, that's like two miles out from here.

So kind of close.

Wow.

Oh my god, it looks.

Pretty.

It's in pretty good shape.

Potholes.

I'm kidding.

I should tell them that.

Yeah, it could
really ruin people's tires,

which is out of consideration for guests.

Should tell them out.

They love feedback.

Hello, nice to meet you.

I am dating your sister.

I hate your roads.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's great.

That's perfect.

They will.

That will be the moment that they just

all fall in love with you
'cause I know they're going to

and it's just like inevitable,
but that would be the moment.

You ready?

I'm nervous.

Oh no.

Oh my god.

Welcome home.

Is that good for you?

You guys are animals.

Yeah, you're disgusting.

Hi, Ada.

Ada?

I'm Ozzie.

It's safe, I promise.

Oh my god.

How'd you like our greeting?

Right this way.

Hi, Oz.

Hey.

I love you.

Oh my gosh.

Hi.

Hi.
You saw my butt.

I did.

Give her some space.

Okay, sorry.

Wait, I don't know where it is.

Where did the ball go?

Long drive?

Not long enough after that.

Like I want more drive.

Coffee?

Yes, please.

Well, you got it.

Thank you.

Let's see.

We got.

Oh, we used to have the.

Well, we got instant coffee,
which is awful and terrible.

Or we have the Guatemalan blend.

Guatemalan it is.

So.

Let's see.

Are you from Chicago originally?

I'm actually from Milwaukee.

I'm from Milwaukee.

Milwaukee, yeah.

I heard they have a nice art museum.

Never been.

Maybe someday I'll spend more
than a couple hours there.

Hm.

They have cheese, yeah.

Yeah, we've got cheese in Milwaukee.

Oh no.

Are you okay?

What's going on?

Oh, I was just.

I just thought we were
like being really loud.

Isn't that what we're doing?

Like being really loud.

Okay, yeah, no.

That's good.

I'm sorry.

That was obnoxious.

It's really quiet here.

Sit.

Sh.

Sit.

Nice.

Let's see.

They didn't get the quiet memo.

Okay.

So.

Why haven't we met you yet?

Marissa just never really like.

I don't know.

Were you serious the whole time?

What?

Together the whole time exclusive.

Ah.

Yeah, it was pretty real right away.

Good.

Nice.

Well, we're glad that it's
finally happening meeting you.

Me too.

Welcome.

Oh my god, look at this place.

Oh my god, I love it.

Oh my god, it's so amazing.

It's so good.

Stop screaming.

Gentlemen live here.

Haven't you ever heard of inside voices?

No.

Oz, why in the fucking fuck

did you buy your
ex-girlfriend's grandma's house?

It was for sale.

Yeah, okay.

It's still kinda creepy though.

Okay, it's not creepy.

She begged me to buy it.

And basically some say I'm a hero.

Does the hero feed the chickens?

Oh, he tries, but they don't
let him close to the coop.

Of course.

We tried sneaking in last
week to grab some eggs.

Yeah, didn't work.

Oh, check this out.

What the fuck?

Yeah.

You guys, take care of this.

Okay, look.

Speaking of taking care of,

why don't you take these ladies upstairs?

Take care of their bags like a gentleman.

I'm not your
squire, but I'll take these.

No, no, no.

Like a gentleman.

Where were ya?

I was behind you.

Excuses, excuses.

Oh okay.

This is mine.

Yeah, obviously.

Ada, do you snore at all?

You better not.

Be nice.

I'm just joking, dude.

Okay.

Okay, fine.

Okay bye.

Bye.

Bunk beds for a reason?

I don't know.

Brothers or whatever, right?

Right.

I'm doing okay.

Like, I'm doing well with them.

Yeah, totally.

You're doing great.

Like A plus.

Nine out of 10.

Oh, nine out of 10.

That's all.

Good.

Honestly,
it's a pretty good bed.

Oh, you get bottom bunk?

Yeah.

Hope this doesn't crash in.

Oh, it doesn't.

Why did you?

Were you wanting it to do that?

Never.

Hi, hand.

Hi.

See, we can like
squeeze messages to each other.

Rescue me from this place.

A SOS.

Yes.

Help.

Yes.

I'll save you.

Oh no.

I brought kites.

Yeah, probably later.

Looks like we're gonna-

Yeah, we're gonna play that game now.

Ringolevio.

Ringolevio.

Ringolevio.

Ringolevio.

That's like capture the flag, right?

Sure.

Yeah, exactly
like capture the flag.

Okay, who's going to explain the rules

to young Ada here?

Ozzie?

Well.

All right.

First thing.

Pick teams.

We are uneven.

Oh, I've gotta be on
the three person team.

Yeah, we don't want her going in blind

and with a handicap, right?

You shouldn't be on Ozzie's team.

He's spurned to buttering
his own teammates into jail.

Well, I guess I know who I got.

Sister for sale.

Sister for sale.

I'm just calling
it how I see it, okay.

Okay, it's Ada, Wren, and me.

And then, Marissa and Ozzie.

We got that, Wren.

Okay, the main thing is you're trying

to avoid the other team's jail

while getting everyone from
that team into your jail.

You can retrieve your
teammates if their caught,

but at your own peril.

No puppy guarding.

No tackling.

You can daisy chain but
don't be a dick about it.

Taunting is obnoxious.

And if blood is drawn, the game is over.

Use whatever strategy you want.

And we play as long as it takes

to get one whole team into jail.

That's it.

Oh, and bring a flair to
your side and light it.

Come on, let's play.

Don't die.

Big time.

Ozzie is.

He's more likely to try
and like mind game us.

We could go bold if we wanted to.

Should we go bold?

That has literally never worked.

Just hear me out for once.

Wait, do you even get the game?

'Cause we have to win.

We can't lose so you have to get the game.

Pretty sure.

I mean, catch them.

Don't get caught.

Yeah, she gets it.

We should go bold.

Come on, let's do it.

Classic strategy.

ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah

Oh shit.

Yeah, you better run, Wren.

I didn't think you'd be first.

I'm proud of you, professor.

You made this quite easy for me.

This is my throne?
Here you go, yes.

Thank you.

Enjoy.
See you later.

Oh my god.

Okay, it's like they
always go that way, right?

So we'll both charge them on the right.

We go the same way.

No, no, no, no.

Yeah?

Okay, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, we both go right.

Sure, fine.

Okay.

All right, I'm ready.

Oh.

Come on.

Woo hoo hoo.

ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah

Get her, Marissa.

Ada, Marissa.

I got you now, dummy.

Let's go.

Come on, cross over.

Oh, I'm on your side.

You took that.

Dammit.

Knock, knock.

Who's there?

Off the jail you.

That doesn't make any sense.

Oh yeah.

Oh yeah, it does.

Oh my god.

Wren, come on.

Get up.

Get in the ring.

Respect the ring, boys.

I will respect nothing.

Your foot in.

It's in, it's in.

Nice job, love you.

Dude, you're not even giving me

like a little bit of the log.

Honestly, man.

Okay.

Do you have the hacky sack?

It's outside the ring.

We can't be outside the ring.

Code of honor.

Yeah, screw that.

I'm bored.

Nowhere to run.

What are you gonna hit me with a stick?

Look, you're the last one left.

We can play another game.

Just give into me and
I will take you home.

Never.

Come on, really?

I'm gonna get ya.

Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Victory.

Fuck, fuck, fuck.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Oh no.

Oh boy, oh boy.

What do I do?

Help me get her up.

Guys, it's fine.

It's fine.

I'm fine.

Oh fuck.

Get out of the way.

Get out of the way.

Hey, head to the barn.

Get out of the way.

Fuck, Marissa, are you okay?

Wren, get the packs.

Okay, okay.

Move.

Arthur, grab her shoe.

Wren, the first aid kid.

I don't know where that is.

Arthur, find the first aid kit.

No, no, guys, her leg.

Disinfect it.

It's alcohol.

It's all right.

That's sugar.

It has sugar in it.

My fucking way.

Okay, okay.

Open this for me.

Yes.

I got you, I got you.

Marissa.

You're gonna be all right.

It doesn't look that bad.

It's too tight.

Can you not do it so tight please?

Take her shoe.

Take her shoe.

Take her shoe?

Take her shoe off.

I got you, I got you.

Ow, ow, fuck.

Sorry, sorry.

Goddammit.

Is that too tight?

No.

Yeah, all right.

All right.

What happened?

We were playing the game
and I was dodging her.

She was running at me and
she tripped over something.

Guys, she needs to go to the hospital.

We got it.

We got it.

You don't need to go to the hospital.

You're a Faber, yeah?

We were so close to winning.

We won.

You guys okay?

What's next?

Hey Wren, got some cards?

Let's work on those decks, boys.

There's gotta be 52 cards in
there between the three of 'em.

Ah, Wren.

What do we have?

How 'bout that?

Hearts.

Can we just deal already please?

Five, 10, jack, 10, four.

Can we deal?

Be ready to ante up.

Cool, so what does this mean?

What do you mean?

Well I have a black ace
and then I have a red five.

What?

Rigged.

You can't say your cards.

It's poker.

Right, right.

I bid a lot.

How much?

I don't know.

Doesn't matter because
I am going to go all in.

All right.

Straight, count 'em.

Oh, that's a really good hand.

What do you have?

I just have these two.

You have a flush.

Does a flush beat a straight?

She doesn't even know.

It's okay.

Dammit.

Renny.

So a flush does beat a straight?

Yes, it does.

Good.

All these
chips belong to you now.

Ooh.

What's he doing?

Probably looking for something to break.

Yeah, he's just getting off some steam.

Was that a bad beat?

I've seen "Rounders".

Oh my god, seriously?

That's the bet.

Call or fold, Marissa.

Call or fold, Marissa.

Call or fold, Marissa.

I fold.

She folded.

Wow.

I win again.

Ooh wow.

Ooh wow.

What a hand I have.

Such a hot hand.

Bet you can't beat this hand, Ada.

Ooh.

Ooh, what a great hand.

Arthur folds.

I'll call.
What?

There's no surprise there.
I'll call.

Some good action.

All right.

Let's see the flop.

You're all in.

Yup.

And I fold.

What?

Wait what?

You win.

Wow.

We can deal it out.

No, no, it's fine.

Marissa.

You win again.

I found it.

I found it.

Found what?

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

It's gonna be good.

Come on, seriously?

Turn that off.

Turn it off.

Never.

There's no reason for that
to be playing right now, okay.

There's every reason.

No, there's not.

Turn it off.

No, come on.

Turn it off.

What's the big deal?

Wren, turn it off.

Turn it off.

Whoa, Wren.

What?

Wren, you are going too far.

I'm not.

What?

Come on, we're having a
fun family Easter reunion.

Whatever it is we're calling this.

I don't know.

What is this?

I mean.

Come on, we can't have
a true family reunion

without playing this god awful music

that she made us listen to for years.

God awful music?

Yeah.

It's pretty down.

It's about time you
were gonna be an asshole.

What?

What are you doing?

What?

Marissa, I'm sorry.

What?

Come on, man.

What?

Hey.

Marissa.

I got you so good.

Dude, that's not cool.

Had ya.

Had ya.

Do you wanna talk?

Not really, but I guess
that wouldn't be fair to you.

We can just sit.

Man, I know you're trying
to get along with them,

but does it have to be at my expense?

Wait, what?

During poker you were
being kind of a dick.

I thought you were mad about the CD.

No.

Wren's an asshole, but
he's always an asshole.

Okay.

What does that even mean?

I mean, I was just trying
to get along with them

and I thought I was doing pretty okay.

Yeah, you are doing pretty okay.

It's just.

I'm in enough pain already, you know?

Oh my god.

Look, I'm sorry.

Okay?

What?

Look, I'm sorry you hurt your leg.

I'm not.

I'm not mad at you about that.

I'm not, okay.

All I'm saying is that
I'm in enough fucking pain

and you don't need to pile on, okay.

They do that enough.

Okay.

Is it okay?
Okay, yeah.

Am I being unreasonable?

I get it.

I went too far.

I don't mind.

Just do what you're gonna do.

What?

Oh.

I run at night.

Otherwise I have nightmares.

Not the manliest thing
to admit, but you know.

Tonight's got me all wound up.

You know.

You know, you shouldn't feel bad

about not doing anything
about Marissa out there.

These things, they happen, you know?

You know, I'm not sure if Marissa
really tells you about us.

You know, if they would've let me,

I would've adopted Marissa and
Wren the second I turned 18.

Arthur, too, if he wasn't right behind me.

You know, when our mom
went to rehab again,

they were gonna send Marissa
to live with Grandma who,

well Grandma only wanted to.

She was sketchy.

I'm sure Marissa told you about that one.

Yeah, she collected rocking chair horses.

She sold them at auction
every summer in Florida.

Well, she'd lived off that
money all year, drink,

and watch porn all day.

Marissa would've been
miserable with her in New York.

What I mean to say is that
we're each other's family.

We're more than just family.

I mean, that's what you're stepping into.

Out of all the homes and aunts

and stuff we were moved around to,

those years that the
four of us had together,

I mean those were the really good ones.

Marissa's more.

She's our favorite.

And Wren, he's young, you know.

I mean, he has to be the asshole.

He is.

She's tough.

She's tough because we
wouldn't let her be weak.

Sh.

Sh, sh, sh, sh.

She has to be.

Hey.

Hey.

Sh.

What's going on?

We're gonna get Marissa.

Get her?

Yeah, favorite tradition.

We used to soak towels
and throw at Marissa

when she was sleeping.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Why?

You know.

I don't really know why we do it.

Because it's funny, dummy.

Oh yeah.

It's funny.

Well you know Marissa's
really tired tonight so.

So?

So maybe you shouldn't do that tonight.

Oh.

Maybe we can like get Marissa tomorrow.

I see.

What are we gonna do
with all these wet towels?

I suppose we'll just
have to dry them, yeah.

Wait, just don't tickle me.

We're supposed to.

It's tradition.

Sorry we woke you up.

Goodnight, Arthur.

Goodnight.

Goodnight.

Wow.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

What did you just do?

I just said wow and
it blows the candle out.

Ozzie, where's your lighter?

Drawer.

Just say wow and it blows it out.

There we go.

Wow, wow.

Wow.

It's like he's enchanting it.

Lies.

No, you gotta with aplomb.

Aplomb?

Poof.

That's kind of cool.

Go for it.

Wow.

Aplomb.

All right, y'all.

Goodnight.

Ada, where did you learn this?

My mom.

Three, two, one.

Wow.

What?

Ozzie.

Making a wish.

Wow.

Ready?

Yeah, I'm good.

Fuck, okay, let me do it again.

Let me do it again.

Sorry, that failed.

Good morning.

Morning.

Hey, why didn't you wake me up?

You were nightmaring all night.

I thought you would use some extra rest.

Oh, I was?

Yeah, it's
been awhile but yeah.

I didn't like wake up Wren.

Don't worry about it.

I'm sorry.

Thank you.

Did she sleepwalk?

No.

I wish.

Do you want some crinkle?

Crinkle?

What's crinkle?

Crinkle is a little dessert.

Sure.

But it's
disguised as breakfast.

Perfect.

So, you're supposed to stay

in the house until Ozzie's finished.

With the eggs.

Oh, did he get to the chickens?

No.

Easter eggs.

Oh, you guys do that.

Not really.

Yeah, Ozzie says it's a special treat

for our honored guest.

You were supposed to help.

Whoa.

Morning.

Oh dude, crinkle sweet.

Maybe if you got
an alarm clock, it'd help.

That's our dog.

Yeah, got him
out the pound last week.

I don't know
what to think about him.

Oh no, I
think he's a mixed breed.

Ooh, found one.

Nice, Ris.

Marissa, look.

Just leave it.

No, I'm gonna get it.

Why?

It'll fester in a week
and smell really bad.

Then we'll have to get it anyway.

Can we just go inside please?

It's freezing outside.

Just this one last egg
and then I will go inside,

get a blanket, and wrap you up,

and breathe my hot air on you.

Yes.

Marissa.

I've literally just walked around

this entire place looking for you.

I thought you disappeared.

I'm a magician.

Poof.

So, all of the doors
to the house are locked.

Yeah, I think they went to
work and they locked us out.

Oh.

Yeah, it's pretty typical.

Like they either completely
forgot that we were here

or they wanted to just fend for ourself.

Okay, yeah.

So what time do they get off of work?

Not 'til late.

We can go into town or
something if you want.

In my pajamas?

Okay, why don't we
get you some new clothes

and I'm about to give you the hottest tour

of my hometown that you've ever seen.

You ready?

Good.

Come on.

I can't.

Why?

I'm wearing pajamas.

Fine, fine.

Hey.

Hello.

Miss.

Miss.

Hello.

Could you roll your window down?

Let's go.

Do you?

Do you wanna get a hotel
room for the night?

Sleep in the same bed?

My own bathroom would be nice.

Nice.

Everything looks so different now.

This house is where Ozzie

lost his virginity homecoming night.

And this guy used to be abandoned,

so Wren used to break in there

and he would write his poetry there.

That's what he said.

He also broke in here.

Wren was accused of breaking in there

and then broke in there anyway

'cause he thought he
couldn't get in trouble

due to double jeopardy.

And then that church looking thing

is where Wren and Ozzie
went to elementary school.

And what did you do?

Well I
didn't break in anywhere

and all my schools were
on the other side of town.

Quite a tour then.

One time Ozzie and Wren.

They got all of those marshmallow breads

with their girlfriends at that bakery

and then they brought them all to school

and spray painted them to look.

Okay.

Hey.

Oh ow, ow, ow, fuck.

Fuck, ow, ow, fuck.

What, what's wrong?

Nothing, nothing.

It's just my legs.

It's okay.

Your legs?

Fuck, whatever.

My leg.

Come here.

Well that was the fastest
sex we've ever had.

You can't freeze me out, okay.

How am I freezing you out?

It was accident, Marissa.

I'm just trying to get along with them.

Like play the game.

And like meet them at their level.

Okay, what's going on now?

But if I also get along with
them too well, that's bad.

This is all because I
said my leg was hurting me.

I'm trying here, Marissa.

Okay, great.

But I can't have you setting

these parameters around my behavior.

What parameters am I setting

around your behavior?

Because I am already left out, okay.

Oh yeah.

Like I'm the odd one out.

Yeah, I'm sure it's really hard for you.

Okay and your
brothers, they're weird.

They're really weird.

And they are rude.

And you don't even side with me on things.

Okay, Jesus.

Fuck, I get it, okay.

I won't freeze you out, okay.

Can you turn the TV back on?

Sure.

God, I love the weather so much.

Me too.

Ooh, it's like a double bounce.

Oh wait.

Now we're off again.

Now we're on again.
Hey, Ada.

Hey.

Ozzie wants us to
meet hm at the station soon.

The station?

Yeah, the radio station.

Yeah, his
regulars are out of town

and he needs us to record
some segment for Easter.

It'll be fun.

Sure.

Also, can you stay at the house tonight?

They were kinda pissed.

Oh, okay yeah.

But you know why we did this, right?

You guys locked us out.

Like we had to do this.

Yeah.

So.

Sorry, I thought I told
Wren not to lock it.

He was trying to be funny.

Well it wasn't.

Yeah.

But he doesn't have to be around today

and he does not know
about the radio station.

Don't tell him.

You got it.

I'll wait in the car.

Roll your window down.

Hey.

Right on Main.

And then left on Parker, okay.

Okay.
Parker.

Okay, okay.

And then just go up, okay.

It's on the third floor.

Third floor?

Fourth.

The fourth floor.

We're gonna get some coffee.

Hey.

Arthur took Marissa to get coffee, yeah?

Yeah.

Welcome.

So we have about 30 minutes
before they get here.

Would you mind helping me
record some local commercials

before tomorrow's broadcast?

You want me to do that?

Yeah, if that's cool.

Yeah, yeah.

I mean, as long as I'm not
like live on air or anything.

And I mean, you have scripts?

Script.

I only need one from you.

Cool.

Deep breath.

So how long have you worked here?

A few years.

I actually don't remember.

And you went to
school for journalism then?

Oh no, I didn't need a
degree in journalism for this.

I just knew a guy that knew
a guy on my football team.

Got a job, liked it, kept it.

You played football?

Oh yeah, everyone did.

Football's cool.

Okay.

In here.

That chair.

Okay.

So what are we doing?

Oh, it's a 20 second spot
for a local rental place.

Oh, like a car rental?

No, like.

No, you'll see.

So what kind of like voice should I use?

Like a radio voice.

Whoa.

Okay.

It's.

Sorry.

It's finally-

Oh wait, sorry.

I didn't know you were gonna do that.

Oh.
Just have to hit.

Go.

Oh.

It is finally spring.

Come on down to Randall's
Lawn and Home Rental

for all you need to get
your garden in gear.

This is a really bad script.

Well.

That's what we have to record so.

Sorry, I don't
mean to like offend you,

but it's just bad.

No, no, it's fine.

Let's try it again, but this time just try

and be a little more cheerful

and maybe you know smile when you talk.

Okay.

Actually, I can't.

I can't do this.

Marissa can you just
take my spot and do that?

Okay.

What am I doing?

It's really easy.

There's a script.

Just put a smile on and
speak clearly really.

Go.

Now.

It's finally spring.

Come on down to Randall's

Okay.

I'll assume the position.

Oh no, no, Arthur.

I don't think we need you.

We'll just have Marissa.

What?

Yeah.

Oh, yeah, I got your songs.

So we'll play a song from your new album

How did?

What?

Yeah.

I got 'em from your like

Through the station.

Okay.

All right, we're on in five seconds.

Good afternoon, listeners.

All y'all's gearing up for Easter lunch?

All the families together
counting the chickens

before they hatch or whatever.

Today I have my gorgeous
sister with me in the booth

and we have an exclusive release

of her new upcoming album
of computery music for y'all

and it is called "Lighthouse",
the song we're gonna hear.

Marissa, do you have anything to say

to the nice folks before we roll it?

Nope.

All right, well let's roll it.

Hey, Oz.

Yeah.

Can you just not ask me
anything about the song?

Okay, it's just like a song, you know.

You've convinced me to
your power of conversation.

Thank you.

And that was "Lighthouse"
by Marissa Faber,

our prodigal sister back
for the holiday weekend.

So.

Marissa.

Can you tell us a little more
about your forthcoming album?

Sure.

Yeah, I can give a little
sneak peek I guess.

The album is called "Compass Key"

and it's all sort of
about specific memories

that I have of when I was younger.

A lot of them are about growing up here

and you know I moved to Chicago

and I haven't been up here as often

as I would like and I think.

I think the album is just
sort of like a reminder

to not make the same
mistakes that I made before.

What mistakes?

You're perfect.

I'm not perfect.

We did a bunch of crazy shit when we were.

Stuff.

We did a lot of crazy.

We got into some crazy stuff.

Right, right, right.

Crazy stuff when we
were younger, you know.

So "Lighthouse".

That one's about me, right?

It's not.

I'm so sorry.

It's not.

Well, so it is about me.

Wow.

It's really not.

Oh.

No.

Well, listeners, I think
I know what's going on here.

That song is about an ex of mine.

Right.

Well, in recent news, a 240
year old tavern in Dublin has-

I guess, okay, I guess that song is.

I think the reason why I wrote it

is like in that relationship,

he just didn't get me at all, you know.

We were always like at
arms length of each other

'cause he just had no
idea how to understand me

or like our upbringing or anything and.

He just didn't vibe with it and.

So I wrote.

I wrote that I guess as
an expression of that.

Well, not all relationships
are built to last.

Okay well, the album is
coming out July 12th.

Hope you like it.

Up next we kick off the hog wild hour

featuring all your favorites, KISS, AC/DC.

All of 'em, we got it right
here on 92.7 WCLO The Hog.

Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

Fuck.

Got it?

Yeah.

Smells awesome.

Your ketchup
or some of that ketchup?

Give me some of that chuck.

Oh my god.

Hey.

Food good?

Yeah, it's great.

Thanks, Ada.
It's really good.

Thank you, Ada.

I appreciate it.

It's good.

The best.

Yeah.

Anyway.

Hang on just one second.

Bet you it's a surprise.

Act surprised.

I like good surprises.

Well let's stay open to the possibility

that it might be a good surprise.

Okay.

Okay.

Did you make this?

Gross.

Groany.

What?

Wow, seriously bugs.

Yeah.

I mean, you just kind of get
used to it after a little bit.

Like this guy.

I found this one when I was in the Ozarks.

It was like January out
and he was still out

in like plain sight.

I wasn't really prepared to catch him,

but you know, you make due.

I found this one when I was in Newcastle

upon a time when I went to England.

You know, that was Easter weekend, too.

It was like the only other Easter

that I spent away from my family.

I guess at the time I
thought I was gonna have

this like incredible time

and meet all these incredible people,

but you know when I got there,

it was mostly just like series of meals

at pubs and inns by myself.

No one really talked to me.

I didn't really talk to anyone.

Think I felt pretty alone on that trip.

I guess I thought it was gonna be better

to spend Easter alone.

You know, and I wasn't really like.

I just really didn't
wanna spend another Easter

with my family sitting around
the table and faking it.

So I guess it was good that I was

like across the world and by myself.

And I found this guy.

This cucujidae.

He's perfect.

Cucujidae.

Perfect.

I have more.

Do you wanna see one?

Oh my god.

Melolontha.

Melolontha frater.

Agonum.

What's that?

Sex.

Sexpunctatum.

I really like this one, too.

Oh.

Oh wow.

Got a sting around him.

Nasty.
Got chills.

I got chills.
Oh my god, ew.

Can you show us how?

How do you do this?

How do you find them?

How do you catch them?

Oh.

Do you?

Tonight?

I guess the best way.

You know what?

Follow me.

All right, let's go.

Yup.

Ada, why do you get the big flashlight?

'Cause I'm the expert.

Oh yeah, this is perfect.

Just dark enough.

Oh yeah, I think we can
string it up, you see,

on that little like doorway.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That'd be perfect.

Okay.

It wasn't you.

Looks a
little unfinished, Ozzie.

We got plenty
projects around here.

Right now, I just wanna catch some bugs.

All right, do you mind
helping me string this up?

Just tie it around the post.

Nice and tight.

Have you used this sheet a lot?

Yeah, yeah.

Just a little higher.

A little higher?

You got it.

This a lucky sheet?

Not necessarily lucky.

You have to replace
them every now and then.

Okay.

Yeah.

There you go, tight.

Pull it tight.

I got it tight.

Is yours?

And then you see how it's
kind of billing at the end?

Is there something like
some of these rocks maybe?

I got these right here.

Sweet, okay.

Yeah.

Oh yeah, Kool Aid man.

All right now.

Arthur.

Ozzie, just shine your
flashlights on the sheet.

Just anywhere?

Like this?

Yeah, just not so much moving around.

Yeah, one spot there.

There you go.

What kind of bugs show up?

Oh, you never really know.

It's usually just like flies and moths,

but sometimes you get the
cool ones like the beetles.

Nice.

And how long do you normally wait?

As long as you can stand it.

Like fishing.

Would you say you've waited
over 1,000 hours, 2,000 hours

for bugs to show up or?

It's totally, totally worth it.

I promise.

You know, if you waited
more than 36 hours,

that would be like-

Knock it off, Oz.

Cucujidae day and a half.

Oh look, you see?

What?

Little ladybug.

I got so many of those though.

I don't need another one.

Oh, of course.

So many.

So many of those of course.

Is there smarts?

Knock it off.

All right, what?

Just trying to have fun.

That's it.

Fun.

What was it?

What was that song you were singing?

You were singing three different songs.

Wait, no.

Wren, sh.

Just easy.

Oh, holy shit.

Who are these people?

A sheet party, dude.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

No, no, no, just wait, just wait.

It'll be fine.

I swear to god.

It'll be fine.

Hey, hey, hey.

Hey pal, you're gonna hurt yourself.

There's nails over here.

Just would you stop?

Nails?

Well, I'm a nail this sheet, dude.

Oh my god.

I don't know what
that means, but wait, wait.

Wren, Wren, Wren, Wren.

What, what?

Check me out, check me out.

You see that movie?

Toga, toga.

Toga.

Toga, toga, toga, toga.

Wren, just give it back.

All right, all right,
all right, all right.

We're doing a thing with Ada, come on.

Oh wait.

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

Hold it, wait.

Lift your chin up.

Hold this.

Here.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

Don't worry about it.

Take his room upstairs.

I'll make him sleep in the other room.

Ada.

Wren.

I'm gonna eat you.

Wren.

Wren.

Wren, Wren.

It's nine o'clock.

You ladies, thank you
for bringing him home.

No.

All right, yes.

It's my posse.
Say goodnight.

Ozzie, it's my posse.

You gotta go.
It's my friends.

You can't stay here.

You can't.

Hey, can we talk?

I love you.

Mm hm.

From France.

France.

What's the fire spell?

Everything hurts.

Do you hear me?

Everything hurts.

Hey.

Where are they keys?

Why?

Okay, can I have them, please?

Why?

Can I just have the keys?

Why do you want them?

Do I need a reason?

Okay well, they're my keys so.

Oh my god, okay.

My leg hurts.

I'm gonna go to the hospital.

The hospital?
Mm hm.

Okay, well can
you just wait until after-

Can you just give me the keys?

Can you just give her the keys.

Listen, I'll drive.

Just give me the keys.

Don't leave me alone with them.

Why is everyone screaming?

Wren, can you take
Marissa to the hospital?

Why?

I'm not that hungover.

Why can't you just do it?

Because I'm managing the food.

Ozzie, I mean I can-

No.

Oh, come on, Marissa.

We're just about to start lunch.

I don't care about lunch, okay.

I wanna go to the hospital
for my fucking leg.

Can somebody just give
me some keys, please?

One of their keys.

Thank you.

Be back later, I swear.

Hey guys, I'm really sorry.

Seriously, we try our
best to be welcoming to you.

We could've had a good
time catching up with her,

but we were warm to you, right?

I don't know.

Arthur, forget it.

Okay?

Let's just eat.

Let's just eat.

Hey.

Is everything all right?

Yeah.

Just gave me a bunch of antibiotics.

Called me a dumb ass.

Gave me this beautiful little patch.

Said it'll clear up in a few days so.

That's good.

Is there any food left?

Yeah.

We made you a plate.

It's in the fridge.

Cool.

Thanks much.

I don't.

I don't get this.

Fit in with you.

And I think that I want to.

It's kite time, baby.

Woo.

Here you go.

Oh, those are for us?

Yes, they are.

We get the bugs.
