[A UDlENCE LAUGHSd

New polls show
that 22 percent of Americans...

...now support his third-party bid.

ln a completely unrelated story...

...twenty-two percent
of Americans indicate a preference...

...for getting * * * * * * in the * * *
with a red-hot poker.

[A UDlENCE LAUGHSd

Tough times require a tough man.

And the tougher times get...

...the more the voters will realize
they need me in the Oval Office.

LUTHOR: And not the least
of the problems we face...

...is that of aliens
and so-called superheroes...

...who act on their own as judge,
jury, and often, executioner.

No one is above the law.

l learned that for myself many years ago.

And now
this principle will be the driving force...

...of my presidency.

l have already taken steps
to bring some of these superhumans...

...into the service of our government...

...where their unique powers
will be utilized...

...for the benefit of all Americans.

They are Captain Atom...

...Black Lightning...

...Power Girl...

...Katana, and Major Force.

[CROWD CHEERlNGd

l hope
that in the months to come...

...many more will voluntarily
make the choice they<i>'</i>ve made.

And if they don<i>'</i>t, they will find...

...that they are not as far
above the law as they think.

[SlREN WAlLlNGd

MAN [ON TVd : <i>This started</i>
<i>with a routine traffic stop an hour ago.</i>

<i>The driver brandished a gun</i>
<i>at police, and</i>--

<i>Whoa! That was close.</i>

<i>This man's car</i>
<i>has close to 600 horsepower...</i>

<i>...and can go</i>
<i>almost 200 miles an hour.</i>

<i>That's faster than any police car.</i>

<i>And even the helicopters</i>
<i>are having a hard time keeping up w</i>--

<i>Wait a minute.</i>

[Y ELLSd

So this is what you<i>'</i>ve been up to
these last few months.

Chasing cars.

l help wherever l<i>'</i>m needed.

ATOM: But you haven<i>'</i>t been
needed much lately, have you?

-What do you want?
-We want you to admit something.

l<i>'</i>ll shoot myself, l swear!

Just a minute.

l<i>'</i>m gonna-- Ah!

-Come on, you.
-Out of the car.

Now, what am l supposed to admit?

That Luthor hasn<i>'</i>t done a bad job.

Told you this would be a waste of time.

POWER GlRL: Luthor did the one thing
nobody was expecting.

He made things boring again.

And boring is good, isn<i>'</i>t it?

The economy is back to normal.
Crime is down.

There are no wars or anything.

He<i>'</i>s up to something.
Can<i>'</i>t anybody see that?

ATOM:
That<i>'</i>s what l thought at first.

Eventually, l realized
all he<i>'</i>s trying to do...

...is put that formidable intellect
to work doing such a good job...

...no one will have a choice
but to respect him.

lt<i>'</i>s all about ego now.

SUPERMAN:
l<i>'</i>ll never respect him. He<i>'</i>s a sick man.

He<i>'</i>s not the first to sit in the Oval Office.

He<i>'</i>s right. There have been womanizers,
drunks, crooks...

...but Nixon helped turn our worst enemy
into our best trading partner.

And Johnson gave us
the Voting Rights Act.

SUPERMAN: Thanks for the history lesson,
but l<i>'</i>m not buying it.

POWER GlRL:
Come on, work with us. Please?

We need you.

Sorry.

l guess Luthor<i>'</i>s not the only one
with an ego.

ls the spectrographic analysis
complete yet?

MAN: Yes, sir. And the new data
confirms our original analysis.

The meteor is pure kryptonite.

A chunk of Krypton
the size of a small country.

That planet<i>'</i>s been an endless source
of grief for me.

MAN: The new numbers also indicate
our original estimate...

...of time of impact was right.

Seven days.

Correction. There<i>'</i>s not going to be
any impact.

What<i>'</i>s the plan?

Missiles.

WALLER: We<i>'</i>ve never shot down
anything that big before.

LUTHOR:
The missiles will work.

When l first heard about this,
l started doing the calculations myself.

You<i>'</i>re brooding, Amanda.

l<i>'</i>m just thinking
we have all sorts of other firepower.

You mean those so-called superheroes?

WALLER: They do work for you now.
Most of them, anyway.

That<i>'</i>s to keep them
from working against me.

l<i>'</i>m not going to put the fate
of this planet in the hands of....

Of freaks and monsters.

-That<i>'</i>s not why you won<i>'</i>t use them.
LUTHOR: No?

You want all the credit for yourself.

Careful.

Try thinking of it this way:

lf you don<i>'</i>t reach out
to some of those freaks and monsters...

...there might not be a planet left
to feed that massive ego of yours.

Now, if you have nothing else for me....

LUTHOR:
Ms. Waller.

Thank you for your honesty.

LUTHOR: <i>And I want to assure all Americans</i>
<i>and all the citizens of the world...</i>

...that l intend to handle this meteor
with the efficiency...

...that characterized
my previous endeavors.

<i>But, as a precaution</i>,
<i>I'd like to meet with Superman...</i>

<i>...as soon as possible.</i>

<i>It's time to bury our rivalry</i>
<i>once and for all...</i>

<i>...and work together</i>
<i>for the good of mankind.</i>

BATMAN:
This is one time he<i>'</i>s not lying.

About burying the rivalry?

-l don<i>'</i>t think so.
BATMAN: No. About the meteor.

l<i>'</i>ve been following it the last few days
with my own instruments.

l could go up there in a lead suit
and smash the thing.

BATMAN: There<i>'</i>s no amount of lead
that could keep out so much radiation.

And it wouldn<i>'</i>t stand up
to all that smashing either.

SUPERMAN:
Got anything better?

BATMAN: l<i>'</i>m working on something
with one of my contacts.

You<i>'</i>re going to go
and meet with him, aren<i>'</i>t you?

You know me too well.

l can<i>'</i>t just stand back and do nothing.

BATMAN: Well, when it all goes south,
don<i>'</i>t count on me to save you.

l won<i>'</i>t.

l know you pretty well too.

Well?

Somehow, l knew that would be
the first word out of your mouth.

When the meteor gets close enough,
l<i>'</i>m sending up a dozen missiles.

Each one is going to have
a 50-megaton warhead.

What do you want from me?

Some of my people don<i>'</i>t have
as much confidence in this plan as l do.

They think l need a backup.

With the whole world at stake,
that<i>'</i>s not a bad idea.

Does that mean
you<i>'</i>re willing to work for me?

-For you?
-Yes. You<i>'</i>ll be working for me.

But only insofar as l represent
the country that adopted you.

And that you love.

What<i>'</i>s wrong?
Was l getting too sentimental?

Luthor.

You think l<i>'</i>d be crazy enough...

...to meet you
without some kind of protection?

-Metallo.
-Who else could stand up to you?

[GRO ANlNGd

Shouldn<i>'</i>t have done that.
He<i>'</i>s the president.

[GRUNTlNGd

-That<i>'</i>s not gonna hold him for long.
-l know.

That<i>'</i>s why you have to get out of here.

METALLO:
Superman.

From me to you.

[BEEPlNGd

What was that explosion? Plastique?

-Something like that.
-lt won<i>'</i>t stop him.

-He<i>'</i>s going to reconfigure.
-Don<i>'</i>t worry about that now.

The kryptonite is near your heart.

l don<i>'</i>t know if l<i>'</i>ll get it
before the wound closes.

Where<i>'</i>s The Flash when you need him?

Do me a favor
and lose the sense of humor.

Do us both a favor and buy one.

BATMAN: We can<i>'</i>t go back up.
He might still be there.

Neither of us is in any shape
to take him on.

Then what are we supposed to do?

The cemetery was built
over the old sewer system.

But how can we--?

-Are you up to it?
-We<i>'</i>ll find out, won<i>'</i>t we?

Oh, it<i>'</i>s you.

Bruce.

lt<i>'</i>s not ending here.

l won<i>'</i>t let it.

l thought...

...l was supposed to rescue you.

There might still be time for that.

[GRO ANSd

Can we get to your cave from here?

BATMAN:
Eventually.

Time for you to see my side of the world.

SUPERMAN:
Some company you keep.

[GRO ANlNGd

Come on, Bruce. Stay with me.

You know who l was thinking
about the other day?

BATMAN: Who?
-Magpie.

BATMAN: The criminal?
-Do we know another Magpie?

Whatever happened to her?

-She died.
-No. Are you sure?

BATMAN:
Reasonably.

Why is it that good villains never die?

BATMAN:
Clark, what the hell are good villains?

-Can you do it?
-Sure.

Bend steel and all that.

BATMAN:
Clark.

lt tickles.

MAN:
Halt.

ldentify yourselves.

BATMAN: Alfred, it<i>'</i>s me.
-Master Bruce.

ALFRED:
You can rest easy, sir.

SUPERMAN:
l<i>'</i>m already feeling better. Thanks.

l took the liberty of washing
and repairing your shirt and cape.

The souvenirs of the Gotham City sewers
are best left under the streets.

l<i>'</i>m sure Lois will appreciate that.

LUTHOR:
--<i>honor and distinction.</i>

<i>John Corben might have been</i>
<i>more machine than man...</i>

<i>...but he was still human.</i>

<i>A human being</i>
<i>who certainly didn't deserve this.</i>

<i>He came to me months ago</i>,
<i>seeking a pardon and a fresh start...</i>

<i>...and, mindful of my own history...</i>

<i>...as well as his enormous potential</i>
<i>for good...</i>

<i>...I granted him both.</i>

<i>In the short time Mr. Corben had left</i>,
<i>he worked hard for this country...</i>

<i>...helping to keep her secure</i>
<i>from terrorist threats.</i>

<i>Then, last night</i>,
<i>John Corben was murdered.</i>

<i>Murdered, our prosecutors believe...</i>

<i>...by a man</i>
<i>who used his own freakish power...</i>

<i>...to settle a personal score</i>
<i>in violation of the laws that bind us all.</i>

<i>A man who calls himself Superman.</i>

Does he think
anybody<i>'</i>s gonna believe that?

<i>I met with Superman</i>
<i>to try to enlist him...</i>

<i>...in the government's effort</i>
<i>to stop the meteor.</i>

<i>He, of all people</i>,
<i>should have been eager to help.</i>

<i>But instead, he lost his temper.</i>

<i>Metallo stepped in to protect me.</i>

<i>And this is what Superman did to him.</i>

<i>I know many of you</i>
<i>will find it difficult to believe...</i>

<i>...that Superman could do this.</i>

<i>I shared that skepticism...</i>

<i>...until some of our top scientists</i>
<i>reminded me...</i>

<i>...that Superman's vulnerability</i>
<i>to kryptonite...</i>

<i>...can have a psychological component.</i>

<i>In other words</i>,
<i>the radiation from the approaching meteor...</i>

<i>...is affecting Superman's mind.</i>

<i>He's a danger to us all now.</i>

<i>And himself as well.</i>

<i>In accordance with that...</i>

<i>...I am announcing a bounty on him...</i>

<i>...in the amount of one billion dollars.</i>

lt pains me to do this...

...but as our planet faces
its gravest peril...

...we cannot afford to be distracted
by one man<i>'</i>s growing irrationality.

Thank you and good night.

MAN 1 : And we<i>'</i>re out.
WOMAN: Thank you, Mr. President.

MAN 2:
Let<i>'</i>s go, people.

[K NOCKlNGd

LUTHOR:
Come in.

Mr. President, can l talk to you?
lt<i>'</i>s really important.

SUPERMAN:
''Growing irrationality''?

-Who does he think--?
-Can it affect your mind?

No. l mean, it never has.

Look, this whole thing
is just plain ridiculous.

-l can prove l didn<i>'</i>t kill him.
-How?

You were with me the whole time, and--

-Oh.
-l<i>'</i>ll figure out a way to clear this up later.

Right now,
you and l have a meteor to stop.

POWER GlRL:
He didn<i>'</i>t do it. l<i>'</i>m sure of it.

Oh, really?

lt<i>'</i>s just not in him.

Do me a favor.

Think back to three years ago.

Could you have even dreamed back then
that l would be president today?

Did you think it was in me?

Then if l could change that much,
couldn<i>'</i>t he?

You<i>'</i>re late. What took you?

l honestly don<i>'</i>t think you<i>'</i>d understand.

-Lois?
-Mm-hm.

BATMAN:
You<i>'</i>re right.

You know,
you didn<i>'</i>t need to use the wire.

-l could have carried you.
-Between you and me, l hate that.

This won<i>'</i>t take long.

[K EYS CLlCKlNGd

[SUPERMAN SNlFFlNGd

-See something?
-Smell something.

Now even l can smell it.

They must think l did this
with my heat vision.

[CRACKLlNGd

You couldn<i>'</i>t have.
Not unless your heat vision is radioactive.

lt<i>'</i>s not, is it?

No. This way.

-Now l really do look like a criminal.
-lt<i>'</i>s done wonders for me.

But how do we get the data now?

There<i>'</i>s one other possibility.

[SCREECHlNGd

[GRUNTlNGd

[SCREECHlNGd

Okay, where<i>'</i>s your friend?

Yeah. The one
who<i>'</i>s worth a billion bucks.

You wanna play it that way? Okay.

BATMAN: <i>Superman.</i>
-Little busy at the moment.

BATMAN:
When you can, bring the heat.

Now!

-You all right?
-Better than them, anyway.

Banshee<i>'</i>s out.
Can you keep her that way?

Hypersonics.
Effective even on metahumans.

lf she tries anything...

...this will drive her scream
right back at her.

[R UMBLlNGd

-More?
-Everyone wants that reward.

All you are is a rat with wings.

And what better way to get rid of a rat
than by drowning it?

There. That wasn<i>'</i>t too difficult.
l<i>'</i>ll have to ask the Joker...

...why he<i>'</i>s had so much trouble
doing this over the years.

So this isn<i>'</i>t a complete waste
of my energies...

...let<i>'</i>s have a peek under that cowl.

What do you need with money, Mongul?

All you<i>'</i>ve ever cared about
is ruling the universe.

Grundy not feel good.

Grundy gonna feel a lot worse.

BATMAN:
Shiva.

You wanna be Luthor<i>'</i>s boy now?

l<i>'</i>m sick...

...of Lex Luthor.

[GRUNTlNGd

Mongul wasn<i>'</i>t his usual
talkative self.

And Grundy
sounded like William F. Buckley.

You think
there<i>'</i>s some kind of mind control going on?

A telepath, or maybe a--?

-Nightshade.
NlGHTSHADE: lnteresting.

Even the lesser ones have some value...

...when their powers
are put to the proper use.

BATMAN:
l know that speech pattern.

SUPERMAN:
Top of that building.

BATMAN:
Grodd. Of course.

Had to be a telepath.
Heard a gorilla<i>'</i>s heartbeat.

Pull.

Hey. What--?

We<i>'</i>re surrounded.
l can hear them coming.

[R UMBLlNGd

l suppose it<i>'</i>s useless to tell you to leave.

l wouldn<i>'</i>t miss this for anything.

-Your funeral.
-Already had one.

-l never believed in the cavalry.
-Captain Atom, l wanna thank you--

l have a federal warrant
for your arrest, Superman.

So much for the cavalry.

[GRO ANlNGd

Are you all right, Mr. President?

Fine. But thank you for asking.

At ease, at ease.

Let<i>'</i>s see those missiles, general.

BATMAN:
You sold out to Luthor.

l<i>'</i>m doing my duty.

Look, this isn<i>'</i>t my decision to make.
lt<i>'</i>s the court<i>'</i>s.

''Court<i>'</i>s''? This is Luthor<i>'</i>s vendetta.

Power Girl,
what do you think about all this?

lt doesn<i>'</i>t matter what any of us thinks.
Luthor is the president...

...and what he says goes.

Now, are you coming or not?

Not.

You piece of--

POWER GlRL:
Look out!

ATOM:
Enough.

GENERAL: Some of our scientists were
going over the scenario in their computers.

They don<i>'</i>t think the missiles
will be enough to--

General, l don<i>'</i>t care
what your scientists think.

The missiles will knock out that meteor.

-l did all the calculations myself.
-Yes, sir.

[P HONE RlNGSd

Captain Atom. This isn<i>'</i>t the best time.

ATOM: <i>I'm sorry, sir</i>,
<i>but you wanted to be kept apprised.</i>

Yes. Fine. Do you have them in custody?

-<i>No, sir.</i>
-What happened?

-We lost Power Girl.
-<i>She's dead?</i>

-We<i>'</i>re not sure. She--
-<i>Captain Atom...</i>

...l have three words for you:

Finish your job.

Superheroes.

lt<i>'</i>s not gonna be any easier
without Power Girl.

We should have killed them.

We do not kill people. Understand?

ls that right?

[L AUGHlNGd

-You all right?
-Uh-huh.

-What made you do that?
-Warn you?

lt just sort of came out.

-You don<i>'</i>t think l killed Metallo, do you?
-Don<i>'</i>t know. Luthor says you did.

Tell me something, Power Girl.

Now that you<i>'</i>ve been up close
and personal with Luthor...

-...how do you feel about him?
-He<i>'</i>s the president.

But how do you feel
when you<i>'</i>re around him?

He--

He makes my skin crawl.

Sometimes you have
to trust your instincts.

But how do you know when?

Now.

-See? She<i>'</i>s a traitor.
-ls that true?

-lt<i>'</i>s complicated.
-No, it isn<i>'</i>t.

-Tell me something.
-What do you want, dirtbag?

Did Metallo say anything
before he died?

Was he surprised to see you?

l don<i>'</i>t know what you<i>'</i>re talking about.

BATMAN:
What did Luthor promise you?

-Money?
FORCE: What do l need with money?

l<i>'</i>m living energy.

You<i>'</i>re not going to tell me you killed him
for your country, are you?

Some of us still believe
in putting our country first.

Sorry, but l don<i>'</i>t see any patriotism here.

All l see is a psycho who<i>'</i>s latched
onto an excuse to kill people...

...and who<i>'</i>s so stupid he doesn<i>'</i>t realize
he<i>'</i>s being used by Luthor.

Power Girl, don<i>'</i>t!

[Y ELLSd

Do you know what you<i>'</i>ve done?

Can either of you contain that radiation?

-l might be able to put up a force field.
-Go.

-He<i>'</i>s not gonna be able to keep that up.
ATOM: l can absorb it.

-Captain, l can<i>'</i>t let you--
-l was watching. And listening.

This is the least l can do.

Let<i>'</i>s do this.

We didn<i>'</i>t take into account
all that radiation.

lt detonated the warheads
before they hit.

So the meteor is--

GENERAL:
Still on course.

POWER GlRL:
Well, this is it.

Luthor<i>'</i>s got his own office in there.

This has to be where he<i>'</i>s keeping
the information.

And by now,
they must have the numbers we need...

...on the meteor<i>'</i>s radiation level.

-So how do we get in?
-Don<i>'</i>t worry.

We<i>'</i>ve got it worked out.

But you need to be somewhere else
right now.

-Yeah, but--
-Go.

They<i>'</i>re bound to have all kinds of radar.
We should go the rest of the way on foot.

We do have something worked out,
don<i>'</i>t we?

No. But l<i>'</i>m sure it<i>'</i>ll come to me.

lt doesn<i>'</i>t take the wisdom of Solomon
to know you should stay down.

Tell me something, Captain Marvel.

Would Solomon have gone to work
for Lex Luthor?

Batman, don<i>'</i>t make this any more difficult
than it has to be.

You wanna play it that way? Fine.

You know,
you<i>'</i>ve never been any good against magic.

And magic<i>'</i>s what l<i>'</i>m all about.

-Superman. Castling.
-Good call.

Captain Marvel?

SUPERMAN:
Hawkman, before you black out...

...l want you to know
l wish it didn<i>'</i>t have to be like this.

Before l black out?

Are you all right?

Say something.

<i>This initial attempt was planned</i>
<i>from the start only as a research mission.</i>

<i>Now that I have the data I need</i>

A little steroidal cocktail for strength,

Well, just in case.

How long--?

Since the last week of the campaign.

lt<i>'</i>s given me boundless energy

-What about the meteor?

lt doesn<i>'</i>t have to. There are other ways.

-That boy in Japan.

from the ashes will be a better one.

Got everything we needed.

Thanks again for your help

Now l gotta rebuild them from scratch.

Hiro-- Uh, Toyman,
can we please see the rocket now?

Sure, sure.

l didn<i>'</i>t have a lot of time...

...so l based it on a design

That<i>'</i>s why it has manual controls

Oh, one other thing.

Who<i>'</i>s there?

[GRUNTlNGd

BATMAN: lsn<i>'</i>t there any way
to speed this up, Toyman?

Sure, go find
some other kid with a 21 0 lQ.

And good luck with that.

[P OWER GlRL SCREAMS lN DlSTANCEd

Hello, sunshine.

BATMAN:
Keep going.

l can<i>'</i>t think of a morning...

...l haven<i>'</i>t woken up
with the thought of strangling you.

That sanctimonious image
of yours fooled everyone...

...except me...

...because l know evil.

lt had to be you...

...the one other person in the world
smart enough to stop that meteor.

The only person smart enough.
You couldn<i>'</i>t do it, remember?

What are you doing?
How am l gonna guide my rocket?

You<i>'</i>re not going to.

lt<i>'</i>s never going to take off.

SUPERMAN:
Wait.

What are you doing?

l<i>'</i>m going to fly this thing myself.

Are you crazy?

Goodbye.

You come to this planet...

...declare yourself the savior of mankind.

Well, l think it<i>'</i>s time you died
for your sins.

That was my best friend.

And you just killed him.

When does it end, Luthor?

l<i>'</i>ll answer for you. lt ends tonight.

[CHEERlNGd

You can<i>'</i>t touch me.
We<i>'</i>re on American soil now.

And l am the president.

Consider yourself...

-...impeached.
-Yeah!

Superman.

Looks like l recovered a little too late.

Forget about that.
l got a message from Toyman.

He says that there<i>'</i>s still a chance.

[L UTHOR GRO ANSd

What are you doing? Stay back. Stop.

That<i>'</i>s an order from the president!

[P EOPLE CHEERlNGd

LUTHOR: The voice of the people
must be heard. l am the president!

God bless America.

God bless me.

[SlREN WAlLlNGd

l have the feeling l<i>'</i>m not gonna have
to worry about that murder charge.

Would have been
an interesting trial, though.

[HELlCOPTER BLADES WHlRRlNGd

Wanna stick around for a while?
Lois and l would--

l can<i>'</i>t. lt<i>'</i>s late.

''Late''?

Come on, it<i>'</i>s...

...early.
