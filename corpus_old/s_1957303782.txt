30 seconds left to see the Bears.

And the Bears take out the Packers,
40--

You really think people

will still...

Yes, some people still have hope

.. no
hope from the beginning.

You
never know what will happen.

They may be down, but I can see
them doing the right things.

ate
up the Packer's offense

all day long.

Well we
heard that several times today.

And
you will hear it all week,

as the Packers were heavy favorites.

It seems
like they have been limited.

Sometimes no matter how hard you try,

you're just up against it.

If I didn't know any better.

Be careful now.

I'm not insinuating--

â™« My head against the window pane

â™« Watch the sky and the falling rain

â™« I can't stop thinking of you

â™« I watched you walk
off the plane that day

â™« My body couldn't move

Hey, Tommy, man!

â™« Those words that will get
you to stay here with me

Hey!

What the hell are you doing here?

Take this bag.

You know you're
not supposed to be here.

I know, I know.

Just take the bag.

It better be good.

Come on, Tommy.

You're not supposed to be here.

I know, I know.

Get the hell out.

I'm leaving, man, I'm leaving.

I'm leaving, okay?

This a party?

Just get out of here.

Okay man, I'm leaving, all right?

Bye, Tommy.

Idiot.

Count it.

I don't need
to take this from you.

You sound like some sort of kid.

You need to tell Harry
that I'm good for it.

Harry says it's time.

I've asked him in the past.

I know what he's gonna say.

No.

Ask him again.

Listen, kid, don't mess with me.

Harry knows me, just ask him.

Okay, listen.

Harry says you're good for it.

I'll see you in two days.

Hey, kid, thanks.

Get the money and don't call me kid.

Told her she shouldn't.

I tell her every time.

She's a moron.

She's high as a kite.

What am I supposed to do?

What are you supposed to do?

You are supposed to keep
freakin' crap like that

from coming around here.

That's what you're supposed to do.

You're supposed to keep morons
from coming into this place.

I know, I know.

You don't know!

You don't fucking know!

That fucking girl is gonna
get us done, mark my words.

If she comes down here
again, pay or no pay,

you are gonna fuckin' done her yourself.

And do what you got to do
to make her understand.

I know.

Don't say I know, again.

I didn't tell you to let that piece

of crap off the hook, did I?

No, I didn't.

Marty, get Bertram on the line.

Hey, Marty.

I'm sorry.

Malcolm.

Why don't you tell Harry
he's got your name wrong?

He's gonna keep calling you that

'til you tell him your name is Malcolm.

Gina, as long as you know what it is,

I don't care what he calls me.

Careful there, tiger.

We need you to call in Zeke Bertram.

She's short.

The black girl, right?

Harry doesn't give her an inch, does he?

Does he not like the black bitches?

She's mixed up in
drugs, among other things.

Harry hates that.

There's money in that.

No, there's not, not for Harry.

That's good to know.

What, are you looking out for me?

Look, I know I'm new here,

but I know only to do what I'm told.

Okay, so how hard do you want this?

We're still talking about Zeke, right?

Don't break anything and
stay away from her face.

She might need that to
make her money back.

I'll see if I can fit her in tomorrow.

You know, Harry asked me
to call in some girls.

Good, you should call Darla.

She'll fuck him hard.

You think that I'm going to get him drunk

and mess around with you?

You already thought
this through, didn't you?

I'm gonna let that slide, this time.

You read my mind.

Hey, Malcolm,

your shoelace is untied.

Do you think I am stupid?

Look at you, you're just a kid.

You're a moron!

This is business.

This isn't personal.

You owe, you pay.

Not personal?

Not personal?

What do you know from personal?

Listen, you messed up.

You placed the bets, not me.

If you don't think these
guys are gonna come back

to get their money,

they're gonna take it from you.

Take it from me?

Take it from me?

What else could they take?

What else have I got?

They'll come back and kill you.

You don't know who you're messing with!

You don't know who you are messing with!

Do it, go ahead, shoot me!

Do it or get out of here!

You'll be sorry.

You'll be sorry, who says that.

I'll be sorry?

A P-38 Card?

Shit, he's a cop.

You worry too much.

Thursday, 4:48.

Derrick,
this is Captain Donovan.

Listen, we don't usually ask.

Well, something just came to my attention.

I know you're listed as an undercover,

but it's not like you're a
special agent or anything.

I need you to come down to the station,

so we can address this.

It's very important that
you come down right away.

Right away.

I'm pretty sure you may have
an idea of what it's about.

Be in my office first thing.

Hello.

Well, what are you doing here?

What am I doing here?

Yeah, what are you doing here?

Get thee out.

You smell of, of the shit!

Now the church is closed.

Are you on drugs or something?

If you don't move, I'm
gonna call the police.

Or I'll kick your ass off
these stairs, me self.

Now you need to get your shit together.

You need to get your shit together!

I don't know, it was midnight.

He's on suspension.

Oh, and if he still wants
to talk about that overtime,

you tell him to come down and see me.

I'll fire his ass.

Captain.

I know it's your wallet.

What's wrong with you?

Being undercover means not screwing up.

You screw up, and you're
gonna get someone killed.

And you, Detective, screwed up.

We were gonna just chuck the damn thing

when we came across your P-Card.

Do you have any idea how dangerous it is

if someone got a hold of that?

Do you have any idea how
dangerous it would be

if they found out our
undercovers carry these?

Are you an idiot?

We may have to change the whole way

we identify the undercovers
now because of this.

I'm sorry, Captain.

Where'd they get it?

A store owner called it in,

said a customer saw you drop it.

Can I go now?

Send him in.

Captain Donovan here.

Yes, sir.

Yes.

Yes, sir.

Yes, I'm dealing with that right now, sir.

Okay.

I'll call you back in about 10 minutes.

Thank you.

You know, you've been with
this department as a detective

for a long time, real long time.

After what happened...

This is Special Agent Greene.

We borrowed him from the
internal affairs office,

about six months ago,

and he's been working
undercover for us since then.

I told you this was serious.

A kid?

Yeah, he is.

But he's also a special agent at 20.

I would think you could appreciate that,

considering you couldn't do
it for the last seven years.

Six.

Seven, but more importantly,

I think you know what that means.

Look, you've only got one choice here.

Can I see your badge?

Congratulations, Special Agent Forrest.

What?

You are no longer a lowly detective.

What, you're not happy?

No, no.

Sir, it's great.

Forgive me, Captain.

What is he doing here, again?

I don't understand.

He is your new partner.

Special Agent Greene, please
meet Special Agent Forrest.

Look, you have to have a partner.

It's just the way it is
when you start out as an SA.

I wanted the two of you to
meet, so you could get cracking.

He's been working the numbers
for a while now for Harry.

One of Harry's clients last week decided

to beat the crap out of him.

He was on the fast track with him,

but it's not looking so good now.

Evidently, they say I look like a kid.

It's hard to get them to trust you

when they think of you as some kid.

And that's where you fit in.

We need you in there working with them,

and he thinks he has a way
he can do that for you.

I don't know, and I don't want to know.

As long as it's mostly legal

and doesn't come back
to bite me in the ass.

That's all I care about.

I don't know.

I mean, I don't know.

Derrick, these might be
the guys, the guys.

I mean, I'm not sure, not sure.

But they might be the guys, the guys.

You were right.

I didn't know who I was messing with.

It's a mistake I shouldn't have made.

But I did, and you did, too.

What's your game?

No game.

You didn't turn me in.

What for?

For beating the crap out of you.

Maybe I was wrong.

Maybe you don't know.

For being a dirty cop.

For being a dirty cop,

I figure there's two
things we can do here,

go back, tell 'em everything.

You lawyer up pretty fast.

I go down as the guy who turned on a cop,

or worse, a guy who fried his own partner.

Or maybe you can straighten
your ass out and be my partner.

Stop the gambling.

Stop the drinking.

And what if I can't?

I already told you.

I go down as the guy who
fried his own partner,

and I will do it.

Why are you doing this?

As messed up as it sounds,

you're the only one I can trust.

You're gonna do what I say.

If you don't, you're gonna fry.

That, and I know what happened.

That's none of your business.

You're right.

It's none of my business.

I told you you'd be sorry.

Don't call me kid.

Hey, Harry.

Yeah, I'm leaving there now.

You won't believe it.

He came up with all 50Gs.

Yeah.

Yeah, hey, I got a favor to ask you.

Hey, I need just a
little bit, just a little.

Please.

Please.

Zeke.

Hey, Thornton, you all right?

Hey, Zeke, Zekey Malekey!

You are the all right, Zeke?

You make the all right?

Not today, Thorn, not today.

When a problem comes
along, you are the fixer.

This time, I'm the one in trouble.

No, tell me, I'm the doctor.

Now tell me and let me help you.

I need money, bad.

Memphis,

she's in a bad place.

If I could get some money,

I could get her through this

and get her clean.

She can have my brush.

â™« I rose to war

â™« I did her right back all day

â™« I want to give her two sorry I coulds

â™« Before I left there on my way

You can learn a thing
or two from Darla here.

â™« Heavy like a mountain

â™« Heavy like a mountain

You can do so much better
than her, Hairy Balls.

I know.

â™« I went to watch my memories

â™« Heavy like a mountain

I know what Daddy likes.

Are you leaving?

In that case, you know he's fair game.

Treat him right.

â™« I never feel the troublin' days

It's all there?

Yeah.

You know, last month, the
boss had to front Harry 10K.

This has it.

What's going on in there?

Cops tell us more than you know.

Like?

Like?

Worry about you.

I'm worried about you.

What?

I need to talk to him.

Was everything there?

Yes.

You don't need to discuss with him.

You don't need to discuss it with him.

Now you may want to, but
there's a big difference

between that and this.

Harry talks to him.

Know Your place.

Your place.

You're one to talk.

Yeah, what'd you say?

Nothing.

Nothing, yeah.

It's just that

things are gonna be run
a little bit differently

when I'm in charge.

You?

You fuckin' mental?

I'm just kidding.

Don't kid, Tommy.

You and me, we got a simple job here.

And the world is full of dead kidders.

Do your job, don't get smart.

I think you need to lighten up.

Tommy!

I can't wait 'til they send me for you.

I'll see you then.

Bye, Father.

Bye, guys, off to school.

Good morning, Father.

Good morning, Father.

Good morning.

I picked up your mail and put it

in your room, your front hall.

Oh.

It looks like there's a package

from the mission in Columbia.

Saw the parish hall is closed again.

Yeah, I've got to keep
the parishioners out

of there right now.

There's, there's a guy sent
in for some papers on those,

but there's something
wrong with the pipes.

I could call a plumber
for you or something.

No, no, it'll be fine.

No, it's okay, Sasha.

Oh God.

Hey, I found these the other day.

Danny Gasco, is this yours?

Danny.

Damn.

Didn't you go
to Cleveland High School?

You asked me if I was Shay
Greene or Grain, and I'm not.

I'm glad you stopped me, though.

You are?

Yeah, I saw you, the other day.

Oh, you did, did you?

Yeah, I realized I
hadn't informed you yet.

Informed me?

I'm sorry, I legally
have to say it like this.

Hi, I'm Danny Gasco, and I'm
a registered sex offender.

And I've moved into the building.

Oh.

It's nice to see a friendly face.

Maybe we can get coffee sometime?

I'm all set but thanks.

What are you doing here?

Hold on, baby, I didn't mean

to cause you any--
Don't talk to me

like you talk to Harry.

Where is he?

Harry's out, too drunk
to know any better.

Tommy?

Making his run.

Your mouth wants to play it safe,

but something else seems to
have a different opinion.

Are you sure?

I'm pretty sure.

Are you sure?

And now I'm really sure.

Time's up, I have to go.

Stop.

I have to go.

You're gonna have to
fight harder than that.

You're a mess.

I'm a mess?

At least I'm not as bad as Stevens.

That man's a bleeder.

Yeah, well, let's
see how wasted they are.

Mr. Fissolino?

You pay them hoo-has, Marty?

Yeah.

Where is she?

Who?

Gina?

Probably your place.

Did you pay them?

Yeah.

Yeah, I paid them.

Was I good, ladies?

The best, Harry.

Harris, Jake, you take care of Stevens?

Good.

A shame, fuckin' dealing drugs.

Ladies, did Marty pay you
enough to take care of my boys?

For you, anything.

What are you doing here?

Get out of here.

Marty, get them out of here!

Thank you, Mr. Fisso, Fissoline.

Shh, we're gonna
party again soon, Harry.

Bye, Harry.

â™« I am coming to get you

Darling, you'll waste your time.

Sorry, you'll waste your time.

It's a little turtle in a little shell,

nothing gonna get it out.

Stay there.

I just came to talk to him.

You just need to back your ass up.

For God sakes, everybody, calm down.

Harry, Mephis..

She's a rat.

She needs help.

Frisk her.

â™« Turn back to

â™« Encourage that truth

She's clean.

No wire on her.

Not unless they're inside of her.

You come here!

She needs--

She needs!

She needs, my needs!

You owe, she owes!

Everybody owes.

I don't owe.

I know what she needs.

I gave it to her.

Now I can't give her nothing.

Harry, Memphis is--

Her name is Memory.

Don't come pukin' that
street crap, bullshit names

into this place.

No more of this Memphis crap.

Oh, you think you can fix her?

Marty.

It's Malcolm.

What?

It's Malcolm.

You keep calling me Marty.

People are starting to call me Marty.

It's Malcolm.

Marty, Malcolm, Maurice,

who gives a crap about your goddam name?

Your name, your name.

Well, you don't know shit
about friskin', Marty.

You gotta search 'em inside and out.

Help me, help me, please.

Help me.

Help me, please.

Help me.

You gonna kill her?

I'll call for cleanup if you are.

No.

Hey, Malcolm.

Hey.

You take care of the girls all right?

Yup.

He sure couldn't.

What's that?

Nothin'.

What's going on?

I think he's pissed.

In there with some whore, I think.

Who?

Darla?

I don't know, didn't see her.

He all right in there?

Yeah, he yelled out.

Said he could take care of it.

All right.

Who's Memphis?

Memphis?

She have blonde hair?

No, I told you, I didn't see her.

Her name came up.

Memphis?
Yeah.

Who is she?

Memphis is a drug addict.

Do yourself a favor.

Stick to running the books.

Dealing's the fastest way out of Harry's.

What's he calling you, Marty?

Yeah, I'll take care of it.

Yeah, hey.

Tommy, I need to
talk to you about this guy.

Who?

The one I told Harry about, a favor.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

He's a friend of mine.

Harry wants you to meet him.

Yeah, sure.

Okay, so when?

When what?

Uh, yeah, um,

bring him by my place
tomorrow morning, seven.

Zeke, Zeke!

What happened?

What are you doing?

Sorry.

She needs help.

Harry?

Why, why?

You know.

I will, I--

No.
I will!

No, no, not for me, not for me.

Zeke, I love you.

You can't, you can't!

Why?

I love her more.

What did she do?

I know, not now.

There is a job to do.

Oh what the fuck, Harry!

A serious job!

Days like today,

this is crap.

I wish it was just all over.

I wish I was dead.

What the hell is going on?

Malcolm's been stealing.

Malcolm?

Malcolm, Malcolm?

Marty, Malcolm, that just left?

How did you--

I know.

It's about trust, it's about trust.

I need you to finish it,

like we finished Stevens.

When we talking?

No rush, whenever,

but before he takes anymore.

What happened with Zeke?

I need...

Zeke and Memory--

What?

I don't know.

Stevens them.

Kill 'em, kill them?

You want me to off Memphis, Memory?

What's wrong with you?

What's--

You know better than to say that, Tom.

Go find Memory.

Go find Zeke.

Pick up some poison, grab a gun,

grab a knife, grab a goddamn candlestick,

I don't give a fuck!

And kill them both.

And when you're done,

go skip off and play
with yourself somewhere.

Do I make myself clear?

Christ's sake, Harry.

You don't want anymore explanations.

If you don't understand,

I can find a retard to explain it to you.

No, I got it.

Where's Gina?

Hell if I know.

I've been trying to send
her these text messages.

I don't know.

What's with this thing?

They can kiss my bare bodkin.

That's what they can do.

I can't continue with this.

You got that package from Columbia?

I saw that bitch deliver it.

You bring it to me, okay.

That's our deal.

Okay, I don't know what's gotten into you.

You've given me a dozen of these packages.

It's not my fault your packages
aren't searched by the feds.

Just because you saw what was inside,

there's no reason to get
bold and tighten that collar.

I didn't know what was in them.

It could've been anything.

You can lie to yourself all you want.

You drop off that package,

or I tell your secret, lover boy.

Don't you talk to him, Father.

My God, what have you done?

Nothing.

That's right, Father, nothing.

Zeke, you're gonna get
your ass beaten again

if you say .

All I needed to do is help her, Marty.

Don't, don't you fuckin' call me that.

Just needed to get her better.

I didn't do anything.

You let him.

You let him what?

Who did this?

Who did this to you?
You need to shut your mouth!

That's right, you didn't do nothing.

I've seen you.

You walking selling
drugs to the little kids.

Is that what you are doing here?

My God, is that how you found out?

I can help you.

Go to hell, devil!

No, I can get what you need for her.

Look, I could help you.

I think you best come with me.

Father, you need to stay out of this.

No, you are wrong.

I will not stand for this!

I can take care of this.

Don't, I beg of you.

I'm not gonna,

I want to help her.

No, Marty.

Are you crazy?

You watched him!

What did you want me to do?

Anything!

I wanted you to do anything.

But if I did something...

look, the guy's an idiot.

He doesn't even know my
fucking name, for God's sakes.

But one word from him, and
I end up in a dumpster.

I couldn't help.

No, you didn't.

I couldn't.

But I can help now.

Okay, I have what she needs.

Hold on.

Here, take this to Memphis,

and for God's sakes,
don't tell anyone, no one.

Okay, I don't like what Harry did.

All right, just take it.

It's my way of saying that I'm sorry.

It won't happen again.

I don't get it.

I'm trying to be nice.

Trust me.

Maybe there's hope for
my eternal salvation yet.

Here.

It's not much.

Just take it.

I'm trying, Agent Greene.

I know.

Take this.

Stop asking questions.

And don't call me Greene.

It's Danny, Danny Gasco.

Yeah, sorry, I forgot.

You go by Gasco.

Danny, Danny G, don't
throw in last names,

Dan, Danny, Danny G.

Yeah, I got it.

All right.

Now just, just stick to it, okay.

My super secret name is Shay Greene.

Just call me Shay.

Good to know you can give
it back, but seriously,

give me the card.

What are you doing?

That's our way out.

That's our way dead.

They know about the cards.

You're going into the rabbit hole,

and the only way out is you
to go all the way through it.

You need to learn to shit, eat

and breathe this kind of life.

No using your identifier, no
calling home, no calling in.

Home.

You got pulled in with your P-Card.

I meant to get caught with the card.

Cops are supposed to bring you straight

to Donovan if you have it.

I had to use it, so I
didn't look suspicious.

You wanted to get arrested?

Yeah, it worked.

I got to you.

You are fucked up.

The only fucked up thing is the people

who don't know about the
card are the cops themselves.

I actually didn't know what it was

until the captain yelled
at me the other day.

You didn't know your field identifier?

I thought it was a gym membership.

A gym...

Did you try to use it?

What do you think?

I haven't been to the gym in years.

So what now?

Harry, Harry Fissolino, do you know him?

I've been workin' on gettin' in with him.

Told him the story, and as
long as you stick to it,

we should be okay.

He always send a boy
around to do his pickups.

Tommy?

We'd better hope they don't know you,

'cause we're gonna go
meet Tommy in the morning.

Tomorrow?

When we do,

he's either gonna kill you, kill me

or ask you to do something.

Something?

Something you're not gonna like.

What?

Somethin' not good.

Like kill somebody?

No, beat up a whore,

some shit like that.

So my options
are die, die or fucked up.

I got you something.

You wear it.

Come on.

I look terrible.

I got it for you.

Okay.

But you wear it next time.

Okay.

Mm-mm.

Thank you.

Come on.

Zeke.

Yes?

After this one,

I promise this is the last.

Okay.

I know, baby.

Hey, don't call me that.

I don't like when you're doing this.

I'll stay around.

Okay then.

I'll come back, tomorrow morning.

You're so good to me.

I try.

There's no elevator in this
piece of crap place of yours.

Crap stairs.

Where are you?

Babe!

Typical.

â™« Hope

â™« I've lost my way

â™« It's been so long

â™« If you were there at all

â™« Now

â™« Emptiness consumes

â™« My broken heart

â™« Finds solace there

â™« Dull me

â™« Take it all away

It's a pink day.

â™« This pain that I'm feeling
Running through my veins

Where the hell have you been?

Groceries.

Come over here.

What for?

You'll see.

Come here.

I wanna smell you.

You got something to say?

You have fun last night, Daddy?

You gonna tell me?

No.

I can smell it on you.

I don't know what you mean.

Tell me!

What?

I smell sex all over you.

You want me, don't you?

No.

Yes, you do.

No, Daddy.

Oh yes, you do.

You know , you
know you want.

Oh hell, let's just go to the bed.

Oh Daddy, you're so good.

You mmem.. , mem..phis. .

Oh yes.

Are you done?

I think so.

I don't know.

Let's just call it a day.

You're so good.

What's the matter, baby?

The boss approved Malcolm.

Stealing?

Yeah.

Well, you had to, baby.

Zeke and Memory, too.

Hey, Tommy.

Zeke here?

Zeke?

Tommy?

I've been so fucked up.

But I want to get better.

Harry wanted me to give you something.

Is that...

Tommy, did I do something wrong?

No.

No, he wants you to get better.

This is gonna help.

Okay.

Okay, I'm trying.

I know.

I need to stop being such a bad girl.

Not like that Memphis.

Tommy, ever since...

You've always been like a brother to me.

Thank you.

Sorry, Harry.

Tommy.

God.

You used to be so strong.

Memory?

What have you, what did you do?

my...

Try you something.

Nobody knows who me is.

Forever girl.

God, you put before me two paths,

the righteous path,

the less righteous.

And if I tell the truth,

it'll take me out of your service.

I want to continue to
spread your word of peace

and spread your glory.

I'm here for you, God.

I'm here to spread your honor.

But I only damn my self through the truth.

I want to continue to save your souls.

I want to continue to,

but I would drive more
people away from you.

More people will hate you.

I want to save souls.

But I must damn my own.

I need a sign.

Dear God in Heaven, I need a sign.

Yo.

Tommy.

Yeah.

We still on for this morning?

Uh, yeah.

Give me a half hour.

I got to take a shit.

All right.

Are you ready?

What is...

My girlfriend.

Girlfriend?

She was killed.

Killed?

In a fire.

Oh my child, oh I'm so sorry.

What do I do?

The only thing to do, pray.

I...

How?

Oh my child, you don't
know the love of God.

Please, dear Heavenly Father, watch over--

Memphis, uh, Memory.

Watch over our, Memory, and please,

dear Heavenly Father, forgive us our sins,

'cause we know they are many.

And watch over Memory and
keep her safe in our hearts

during this time of
great sadness and sorrow.

You saved me.

I saved?

Shh.

Get your asses in here.

Guns on the table.

Wallets, too.

Head on into the parlor.

Known him since I was 10.

Drop your pants, show me your junk.

What are you some--

Just do it!

Peel now!

It ain't even fucking cold in here.

Get dressed.

Danny, we got a lot of
shit going on right now.

Harry, you told me.

What do you know about this guy?

Known him since I was a kid.

We've done a few job together.

Hit a bank once.

I don't have time for this shit.

This is not good.

What?

Zeke.

I patted him down once.

I think he knows me.

Sit down.

What is it?

I talked to the priest.

Look, Zeke, I got to tell you.

It's--
I can't do anything right.

I, I was--

The building, it burnt down.

What do you mean?

What building?

What do you mean--

She had to get out.

What do you mean the
building burnt down?

I was talking to Thornton, the homeless.

Yeah, I know him.

I came back,

and the cops,

they said found her body burned up

in the stairwell.

Oh God.

I'm sorry.

Wait here.

Tommy.

Just stay.

He's a cop.

Empty your pockets.

What's this?

It's, um--

Where'd you get it?

Lockup, evidence locker.

Marked?

No.
Tommy--

You brought a fuckin' cop to my house!

You're Derrick Forrest.

Yeah.

What they did to your
wife and your kids,

we didn't do it.

I don't care.

What are you doing here?

I want in.

Look, I know you run numbers.

You run my numbers.

I also know some of your
guys are getting involved

in the drug trade.

Drug trade?

I could increase your turnout 300%.

And how are you gonna do that?

Hell, if I know.

I really thought you were
gonna kill me by now.

Listen, I know things.

I know where the force is,

and I know how to get around them.

I know who's dirty.

And I know who wants to get dirty.

And I know who's clean.

You said some of my guys are dealin'.

Who?

The new kid.

Danny?

No, the one who wears
black all the time.

Zeke

Fucking Malcolm.

What now?

Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, mother fuck!

Sit down.

You bring a fucking cop to my house.

I don't know, Tommy.

No, no, you don't know.

You don't, fuck!

Fine.

You go kill Malcolm,
bring me proof he's dead.

What?

Your first instinct was right.

There's a problem.

Oh no, there isn't a
problem, is there Forrest?

No.

No, there's a problem.

No, there's no problem.

There's no fucking problem, Shh.. Danny G.

They took his gun.

Derrick they took your gun.

That really doesn't
concern me right now.

Tommy, I will do what you want.

I will kill Malcolm.

Get the fuck out of here.

You know, you're screwed
if he uses your gun.

That was your police issue, right?

Relax.

I'll phone it in.

I'm kidding.

Who the hell is Malcolm?

Malcolm, Malcolm's the new guy.

What are the odds?

You got to be kidding me.

You were bluffing?

How'd you know he wore black?

All the new guys try to impress.

You, too, kid.

Don't call me kid.

Great, how am
I supposed to kill Malcolm.

I don't even have a gun.

Here, take my gun,
just don't leave it behind.

If they find it, they'll think I did it.

You shouldn't be here.

Oh God.

Do you think it's her?

Her face?

I'm so sorry.

It ain't nobler.

Get me out of this.

That's fine.

You do what you got to do.

Please.

You put it in the
place by nine, or don't,

your call.

It's you.

What did he want?

I'm supposed to kill him.

You want to kill him?

No.

But I'm supposed to.

It's not a joke.

I know.

So what am I supposed to do?

You're askin' me, and
I'm supposed to tell you.

Sometimes we don't do
what we're supposed to do,

even though we should.

Zeke,

you need to leave.

Go, go far away from here.

I can't.

Do you want to be dead?

Go, I go.

For what, why?

To stay alive.

What do I care?

I care.

I don't know what to think anymore.

I don't know what to do.

I need to do it for me.

I don't want to do anything for you.

I don't want to do anything for
Harry or Memphis or anybody.

If I am leaving, I'm for me.

Fuck you!

You know, I really--

Fuck you, Tommy!

You think this would hurt me?

I'd rather you put a
bullet through my head

than say what you just said to me.

â™« Raise a hair on my neck

â™« Into the lips we share, yeah

You have the nicest tits.

You should be looking at the numbers.

I know, but I'm distracted
by those massive bongos.

There are none that even come close.

Well, you should know.

You've sampled everyone's.

Don't be like that.

You're the best.

At least now I am.

Don't do that.

Sorry.

Sorry.

You know better.

Here are your numbers.

You're gonna be significantly short.

Malcolm cut you for 34 six,

and you're not gonna be getting
money from ... some others.

I'm sorry about--

Don't do that.

Forget that.

Malcolm shouldn't be
a problem after today.

You're all set.

What the fly?

At least he didn't call me kid.

You?

No.

You.

What did you do?

You killed him?

No.

There is no line.

You have to get that through your head.

You want me to trust you,
and then you do this, why?

You weren't gonna do it.

No, I'm not insane.

My gun?

So now you've got this over my head.

I will kill you if I have to.

This is my operation.

Your operation?

This is supposed to be a police operation.

This is my operation.

If you mess up, I get done,

not the cops, me.

You're one of the bad guys.

I'm trying to get to the
middle of the hornets nest.

The only way I know how to do it is

to become a hornet myself.

It's scum like you I
tried to get off the street.

I'm trying to get the hornets' leader.

I'm trying to get the queen.

I get the queen, I get the entire nest.

If not, I get a bunch of
little pissed off wasps.

It's not wasp.

It's bees.

Wasps don't have a queen.

You know what I mean, forget the wasps.

You want me to start killing people

to get into the middle of this.

Maybe.

You're already here.

Yeah, no thanks to you.

So what?

Now let's go tell Tommy what you did,

so he knows you can trust him.

You are fucking nuts.

It's not funny.

Yeah, it is.

Now let's go get the queen.

The queen?

The queen wasp.

It's bees, you idiot.

Whatever.

Now where's my gun?

Where's Saul?

He's not at the door?

I don't know.

Where's Saul?

Saul?

I sent him to check on you.

Check on me?

Just to see if everything's all right.

You don't trust me?

What's going on?

Malcolm's dead.

Danny's guy took care of it.

He used his police gun.

Police gun?

Yeah, he used to be a cop.

I think it's gonna be all right.

Dirty.

I saw Memory.

I heard.

It had to be done.

You did good, Tommy.

I know, it was--

That piece of crap, Zeke.

Don't.

Don't what?

She's,

she's not dead.

The sooner, the better.

Look, Harry,

Memphis is dead.

The only reason why you wanted
Zeke dead was because of her.

Wait a minute!

You telling me to think about it.

Who the fuck are you?

I need you to get Zeke done.

She's the reason Memory is dead.

You need to do it!

Harry, I need you to reconsider this.

What is wrong with you?

What's in your brain?

She didn't do anything wrong.

She goes free.

Harry, you've been like a father to me.

The son has to grow up.

Oh, I'm done?

Give me a break.

Tommy, Tommy, put the gun down.

Tommy, Tommy, put that gun down.

Tommy, you can't--

The hell I can't!

Memory?

My name is Memphis.

You, you're, you're dead.

Dead means you can't hurt anymore.

I didn't know what to do.

I was confused.

You were on drugs.

I had to do it.

I didn't do this.

Daddy, help me.

Help me get clean.

I can help you.

I need money, just enough to get by.

No, no, I can help you my way.

No, my way.

I need money,

just enough to get me by.
I can't give you money.

I can't give you any money.
Yes, yes, you can.

No, I can't have any more money

going to drugs.
Yes, you can.

No, no drugs, no money.

No.
Memory.

Memphis.
We do this my way.

Memphis, you know I
know how to help you.

I can't be giving you
any more money for drugs.

It's over!

You sent Tommy to kill me.

I--

But you killed me long before that.

I, I, I didn't know.

How could I know?
How could you?

Daddy, I need the money.

I can't give you any more money.

I need the money, I need the money.

We got to do it my way.

I need--

We have to do it my way.

We have to do it my way.

The money's no good.

The money's no good
without doing it right.

You know I know what you need.

I've done it before.

I will take care of you, baby.

I will take care of you.

We'll get it done.

We'll get it done.

Baby,

baby, I love you.

I love you.

I love you, too, Daddy.

Daddy?

What have I done?

It's over.

It's fixed.

Nothing's fixed.

It's easy to hide the dead.

What happened?

Harry and Tommy.

You?

No, no, no, come on, come on, come on.

Dear God.

I know.

What'd you do?

It wasn't me, goddammit.

What do we do, Danny?

What, what do we do?

You're in charge.

Look, what are you talkin' about?

You think Saul's gonna
take over for Harry?

You have to take control of this.

I'm in charge?

That's great.

I need you to take control of this.

Gina, this, it's not the way this is,

Tommy, are they dead?

It is what it is.

Right now, you're in shock,

but you have to just call the boss

and have them send the cleaners.

Think about it.

Gina, I have to tell you something.

I'm a--

Fuck!

Oh!

Tommy!

Oh this hurts.

I can't tell who's dead anymore.

Who did this?

Rizzo's crew.

Shit.

Is he dead?

Yeah.

You call it in?

Call 'em back.

Tell 'em I'm in charge.

I'm gonna need permissions.

I didn't do this.

Memphis is dead.

She's, she's not coming back.

It's not about you or her.

I'm really not sure I
can do this without you.

Yes, you can.

It's what you were meant
to do, what you wanted.

I'll always love you, Tommy.

You go be happy, Zeke.

He is amazing.

Oh.

He is amazing.

Sasha.
He has your smile.

And your heart.

I love you, Sasha.

I gave up everything.

I'm trying to get back in this thing.

I thought I was gonna do
it without you, but now,

now I know you're with me.

Watch over me.

Freeze!
