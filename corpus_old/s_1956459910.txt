CHORUS: (SINGING) <i>Kaslan</i>

At Kaslan,
we believe that happiness

is about more
than entertainment.

It's about being known,
understood, loved.

Introducing your new
best friend, Buddi.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey, Buddi.
Let's watch some TV.

Okay.

<i>Hi, I'm Buddi. I can help you
out all over the house.</i>

Buddi can connect to
and control

all of your Kaslan products
and smart home devices.

<i>He can be your personal DJ,
help tidy up the house.</i>

<i>Control your entire
smart hub system.</i>

<i>Buddi uses advanced
self-learning technology</i>

<i>to constantly find new ways
to entertain you.</i>

Hi, Buddi.
I'm Ben, and I'm 13 years old.

(ON SPEAKERS)
<i>Hi, Buddi. I'm Ben,</i>

(GIRL GIGGLES)

Don't forget
your science book.

HENRY: <i>He adapts
to your daily routine.</i>

Thanks.

HENRY: <i>And finds ways
to make life simpler</i>

<i>by connecting to a host

Thanks, Buddi. I need
a Kaslan Kar pick up, please.

(CHIMES)
Your car is on its way!

HENRY: <i>When Buddi

(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT
ON PA)

Hello.
Nobody told me

the fucking doll was ginger.

Okay, I don't think you're
allowed to say that word.

My kid wanted the blonde one.
You know, that one.

Yeah. So that one
is the Buddi 2,

which hasn't come out yet.

(SIGHS)
And it looks like

you purchased the Buddi 1,
which is this guy.

Listen, I waited
three goddamn weeks

for this ginger piece of shit
to come in the mail.

Okay. Well, I'm so sorry
that you didn't read the box.

And even... There's a window,
that you can see

that his hair is red
and not blonde.

Thanks.

Thanks for shopping
at Zed Mart.

(DOOR OPENS)

(MUFFLED CHATTER)

Heh.


(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

(DOOR UNLOCKS)

KAREN: Hi.
(CAT MEOWING)

Hey, uh, I was just...

Whoa. You look like shit.
What happened to you?

Thanks.
And watch your language.

Sorry.

Andy, I told you
to unpack those boxes.

Okay, I know, and I was.

I wanted to make a mental map

of where I should put
everything first.

You know,
for maximum feng shui.

I think you were maximum
feng-shuing so hard,

you forgot to put
your phone down

for five seconds
and feed Rooney.

You mean this busted-ass phone

that we're replacing
for my birthday?

Dude, I've already been
working doubles

to try to get you
a new hearing aid.

I'm fine with this one,

but this is my primary source
of education.

Oh, my God. I never thought
about it like that.

Wait.

Let me see what your education
has been getting you up to.


(MUSIC PLAYING)
(KAREN SIGHS)

Oh, my God,
I cannot escape this doll.

Okay, wait, wait, wait.
No.

Gross. This is staying with me
for the rest of the night.

What? You...
No.

You can't do that. That's
the only thing to do here.

There's literally an entire
world of things to do.

Look, two kids standing
in the rain. That looks fun.

They could be anybody.
They could be serial killers.

Noodle.

We talked about this.

You said you were gonna try

to make new friends.
(SIGHS)

This move is supposed to be
a new start for us.

Tell you what,
you don't have to unpack

or do anything tonight,

if you just go out there
and try.

Give you your phone back.

Okay. I'll be outside.

Really, that was it?

(BOYS LAUGHING)

(BOY SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

(BOYS EXCLAIMING AND LAUGHING)

(OBJECT CLATTERING)

WOMAN: <i>We picked this up
three weeks ago.</i>

But we took it home,
and we turned it on,

and its eyes were red.

And something's wrong with it.

It was just weird.
And I just thought,

with the new one
coming out in two weeks,

it would just be better for me
to take this back, you know,

get it off my hands. (ECHOES)

So, I'm just wondering,

can I get my money back?

Yeah.

(KAREN HUMMING)

Hey, Wes!

Hi.
Hey, I was just curious.

Um, what happens
to returns like this?

Oh, uh...
Like, really damaged returns.

Yeah, we send it back
to Kaslan.

And what do they do with it?

Probably toss it,
trash compactor.

I don't know.
New model's coming out.

No one's gonna
give a rat's ass

about this thing in two weeks.

So, they won't care
if it doesn't make it

on the truck, right?

I care.

Come on, my kid's birthday
is coming up. Can I have it?

You've got a kid?
Yes, I've got a kid.

I had a very productive
sweet 16, okay?

If you really wanna know.

Come on.

It'll be our little secret.

No one has to know.
Uh...

Just like that time you banged
Susan in the warehouse.

How's your wife, by the way?

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
KAREN: Ha-ha.

Can I have it?
Give it to me.

(GRUNTING)
(KAREN WHINES)

And I'm taking it.

There you go, Wes.

Say hi to your wife.

Yep. Mm-hmm.


Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.

KAREN: Hey! Noodle.

You're home early.

Remember Shane?
Hey, bud.

It's been a while.

I'm... I'm just gonna
make dinner. You hungry?

No. Uh, I'm gonna go hang out

with some kids
down the hall, actually.

Really, who?

Gotta go. Bye!

(KEYS JANGLING)

(VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS
PLAYING)

So, what are you?

Some kind of fourth floor
hallway hobo,

or something like that?

What?

Andy, right?
You just moved into 401?

Yeah. I see you out here,
like, a lot.

Oh, uh, no, it's not me.

I have, like,
five twin brothers,

so we just take shifts.

(CHUCKLES)
(DOOR OPENS)

Are you comin' in or what?

I'll be right there, Ma.

Just give me a minute.

Love you.
(SIGHS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

So that's the mom.

She drags me over for dinner
every week.

So, listen, man, if you
wanna have some dinner,

you're welcome to join us,
'cause I could

really use the backup,
'cause she... (CLICKS TONGUE)

KAREN: Andy?

What's going on?

Is he in trouble?

Yeah. Lots of trouble.

We've been gettin'
lots of complaints about

some kid out here
throwing parties,

selling drugs and beer.

Peddling booze... Um...

Oh.

That was a joke?

It was an attempt.

I was gonna say,
"I'm the fun police."


It's not landing.

Wait, who are you?

I'm Mike... Detective.
Detective Mike.


So, um, I'm just gonna go.

Yeah. I'm gonna go.

All moms are scary,
by the way.

DOREEN: Hurry up, son!

MIKE: It was nice to meet you,
Andy's mom.

Nice meeting you,
Detective Mike.

Bye, Mike.
MIKE: See you later, Andy.

DOREEN: Dinner ain't
gonna cook itself!

MIKE: You're screaming, Ma.
Really?

Must you embarrass me
like that?

Ma, you can't be
shouting like that.

I thought you were out
with your friends.

Why didn't you just
come back inside?

Is Shane still there?

No. He's gone.

Come on, I've got
something for you.

It's a surprise.

Close your eyes.
(SIGHS)

Okay. Hey!

I know it's not your birthday
for a couple weeks,

but this move
has been really tough.

And I know
you're kinda mad at me,

so I think you deserve this.

Early present.

(ANDY SIGHS)

Is that a sigh?

That's the Buddi thing
you're obsessed with.

Yeah, um, it's just...

This thing is for, like,
little kids now.

It came out, like, a year ago.

Okay, I know it's stupid,
but I thought it'd be funny.

Come on!

Let's try it.
Okay.

KAREN: Just remember,
it's refurbished,

so it might not work
perfectly, okay?

(DEVICE SWITCHES ON, PINGS)


(MUSIC CHIMES ON SPEAKERS)

AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Your Buddi is now connected.</i>

Whoa.

Cool.

(STATIC CRACKLES)

Hi. (GLITCHING)
Are you my best buddy?


I guess?


<i>That's bright.</i>

What's your name?

Andy. 'Sup?

Hi, Andysup.



KAREN: Sorry.
BUDDI: What's my name?

ANDY: Um...

Han Solo.

Did you say Chucky?

What? No.
Not even close.

Chucky.
It's...

I like that.

(GLITCHING) Chucky.
(CHUCKLES)

I'm Chucky.

What do you wanna do, Andysup?


Um, I don't know.
Do something cool.

I guess turn on the TV.

CHUCKY: <i>I will do that.</i>

What's a TV?

Are you joking?
That thing.

I cannot process that command.

(SIGHS)
KAREN: <i>Oh, wait a minute.</i>

<i>It says here you gotta</i>

"sync his knowledge base
to the cloud

"before he can connect to
any other Kaslan products."

<i>Okay, Chucky,</i>

connect to the cloud.

(DEVICE TRILLS)
Download.

(CHUCKY'S SPEECH GLITCHES)

Learn stuff.

(WORDS JUMBLING)

I am unable to do that.

<i>It's kinda creepy.</i>

Doesn't work.

God.

Okay, this thing is stupid.

I didn't know
it was that messed up.

No, Mom.
I'll take it back. It's fine.

Mom. Mom, honestly, I like it.

KAREN: No, you don't.
ANDY: Seriously. It's great.

He's hilarious.

I love you.
KAREN: I love you, too.

ANDY: It's actually
pretty cool.

Go to bed, Andysup.
(ANDY CHUCKLES)

ANDY: Come on.


This is my room.


And that's Mickey Rooney.

He's a total dick,
so just don't touch him.

CHUCKY: Total dick.

Whoa.

You're allowed to say that?

Cool.

Uh...

This is my desk.

This is my sketchbook.

I do fake buddy cop
team-ups sometimes.

Like, Dracula and Robin Hood.

Or...

This one's Zorro and Medusa.

Kind of a deep cut.

I don't know, it's stupid.

I do not think it's stupid.

Thanks.

Pity compliments
from a talking doll.

That's my life.

Uh... That's enough
for tonight.

(ANDY SIGHS)
(ROONEY MEOWS)

Do you want to sing
the Buddi song before bed?

No. Uh, I'm good.

until the end</i>

<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

(MUSIC DISTORTS)

Right.
Totally not weird at all.

Are we having fun now?

Sure. Uh, I guess.

Yay!

ANDY: Okay.

(CLOCK TICKING)


Is it time to play again?
Are we having fun now?

No. We're having sleep.

Just please close your eyes
and pretend to be less creepy.

best friend, Andy.

Okay. Stop being so weird.
Quiet time.


<i>Until the end</i>
(GROANING)

<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

<i>I love you more
than you will ever know</i>

<i>I will never...</i>
ANDY: Please shut up.

<i>...let you go</i>


(WATER RUNNING)


you forgot your science book.

(ANDY SIGHS)

Okay, Chucky,
this is not a book.

None of these are books.

Just stay here, okay?

And no more books.

(DOOR OPENS)

(INDISTINCT TV CHATTER)

CHUCKY: You're back!
Jesus!

Whoa!

Were you here the whole time?

I made you a present.

A busted stick.
SHANE: (SOFTLY) Andy.

Shh.

ANDY: I don't get
what she sees in Shane.

I mean, (GRUNTS)

he's not nice.


He's just an asshole.

(CONTINUES GRUNTING)

It doesn't matter anyway.

He's just gonna end up
leaving us,

like everybody else.

I will never leave you.

CHUCKY: Are we having fun now?

ANDY: Yeah. I guess.

Attack? You shouldn't lead
with your chieftain.

I still have to teach you
so much about this. Okay...

Um...


Okay. And I get
to roll again. So...

(DICE CLATTERS)
Boom! Double sixes!

Okay, get that orc outta here.

(ROONEY SNARLS)
Total dick.

Nailed that one.

(YOWLS)
Ow!


(PAINED BREATHING)

CHUCKY: What is that?
The cat scratched me.

Hurts like hell.

Kitty hurt Andy?

Uh, yeah. Stay here.
I'm gonna go find a Band-Aid.

Stupid Rooney.

I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.

(ROONEY MEOWING)

(OBJECTS RATTLING)

(ROONEY YOWLING)

Rooney, I swear to God,
if you don't shut up,

I'm putting you back
on dry food.

(CHUCKY GRUNTING)

ANDY: Chucky! Stop!


You can't do that, okay?
Why would you do that?

He was hurting you.
He was making you unhappy.


Chucky, okay, listen,
look at me.

This is important.

You can't hurt people,
or cats.

It's not cool.

I know you're different,

but that's gotta be
our secret. Okay?

And don't say any weird shit
or creep people out.

(ROONEY YOWLS)
Hey! Cat's freakin' out.

Clean up this room.

Except maybe that guy.

I've got an idea.

Okay. If this is gonna work,

I need you to look as creepy

and scary and angry and mean
as possible. All right?

So, open your eyes
as wide as you can, like...

No, you still look cute.

Open your mouth
as wide as you can

and snarl with your lips.

(SNARLS SOFTLY)

But kinda smile.

Perfect!
Okay, yes, just like that.

(SNARLS)
Okay. Try this one.

Smile as wide as you can.

Wider.

Yes!

Yeah, uh...

It's actually
pretty damn creepy.

Okay, you can stop now.

(ANDY AND PUGG GROAN)

It's fucking loud.

FALYN: That thing just swore.

It... It's not supposed
to be able to do that.

Uh, yeah. I know. He, uh...

It doesn't really
follow the rules.

It doesn't follow the rules?

Like it has a choice?

Kinda, yeah.

Sorry, can I pop in here?
So he just does whatever?

You can make him do whatever?

Pretty much.

Okay, can I just point out
that this is how

every robot apocalypse
scenario begins?

Say "dick cheese."
Dick cheese.


FALYN: That is the coolest.

PUGG: I have so many
questions. Uh, who are you?

His name is Andysup.

I'm Andy.
Falyn. Pugg.

Why are you in the hall?

Uh, I was gonna try
and teach him

to creep out
my mom's boyfriend,

but probably a bad idea.

PUGG: You're wrong.
It's perfect.

And we're doing it right now.

(SNARLS)
Jesus! Fuck! Fuckin'...

Falyn and Pugg?

Hey. Ready?
Yeah. Be back later!

Your sister's pretty hot.
ANDY: Dude, that's my mom.

Heh. Even hotter.

(TOOLS RATTLING)


(GRUNTS SOFTLY)


ANDY: You sure the janitor guy

is not gonna get
any shit for this?

Who cares?
Guy's a total creep.

Is that thing busted?
It's kinda weird looking.

ANDY: No. He's just different.

Now say, "This is for Tupac!"

Do you wanna sing
the Buddi song?

No! Say, "This is for Tupac,"
and stab the asshole.

Come on!
CHUCKY: But I want to.

OMAR: We want this
to go viral. He for real?

CHUCKY: (SINGS)
<i>You are my buddy...</i>

full-blown psycho killer.

Let's see how that goes.
Oh.

Oh, it's winking at me.
I can't look at it anymore.

We gotta hide the evidence.


Shit.

Ugh, is that brain?
(FALYN GAGS)

The skin's on a melon.

Why is there a fruit involved?

Just go straight
to the garbage chute

Right.
And if anybody stops you,

Hi, Mom.

Hi, Andy.
Why are you not in school?

Um, crazy diarrhea.

Okay, got it.
Um, what is that?

It's a present.

Present? For who?

Um, the old lady
down the hall,

because she helps me
with homework.

So, I made her a thing.
KAREN: Cool.

And you guys helped him
with this?

PUGG: No, it was all him.
It was him.

Oh!
Hi, Doreen.

Isn't this a surprise!

Mm-hmm.

Open it.

Yeah.

No! No! Don't! Don't!

Um...

My birthday is next week,
and we can open it then.

Together.

Okay, that's a very strange

So, I'll just go put it
on the shelf until then.

Okay? Okay.
Okay.

All right. Thank you.
No problem.

And, Doreen...
KAREN: Bye.

PUGG: Stupid!
Why did we use wrapping paper?

I'll get rid of it.
Don't worry.

FALYN: You guys are worried

You've got a killer doll
in your closet.

And you know what we gotta do.

PUGG: Shit.

Pugg!

You left me all alone.

I don't like the closet.

I know, Chucky.

Drop the knife.

You're my best buddy.

I just want you to be happy.

I know, buddy.

And we're gonna go play now,

I downloaded...

You ready?
MIKE: Mm-hmm.

The Kaslan app.
MIKE: Okay.

The Kaslan drive.
DOREEN: Kaslan drive.

I thought it was a dating app.
Oh, my God.

(ANDY GIGGLES)
You are so silly!

Can you imagine
if she was out here dating?

And so what? I'm desirable.

MIKE: Excuse me.

Anyway, Andy, help me
figure this thing out.

(LAUGHING)
ANDY: Okay.

So, here's the app.
What do I do?

Okay. So, once you sign up...
Mm-hmm.

...you just press this button

take you wherever you want.
It's super easy.

<i>No, wait.
It'll drive me to Bingo,</i>

<i>and I don't have to worry

<i>driving me around?</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

DOREEN: <i>Andy, you're my

I don't want you going
out there alone, okay?

'Cause it's not safe.

DOREEN: (SCOFFS)
The only thing not safe

around here is your cooking.
Oh, is that right?

'Cause, um, I can...
Yeah.

Poor Andy gotta suffer...

It tastes like instant!

It's good. I think it's good.

DOREEN: You know what?
Thank you, Andy.

You are just too sweet
for your own good, Andy.

That's all.
Don't be influenced by him.

MIKE: I learned my cooking
from you, you know?

DOREEN: Yeah,
'cause I can cook.

(MIKE AND DOREEN LAUGH)

Oh, God...

MIKE: Hey, Ma.
DOREEN: Yeah, baby.

You been to vintage shoppin'

Oh!

Andy made this for me.

Oh, and we are gonna...

(PLATES RATTLE)

And we are gonna open it

Oh!
DOREEN: Mm-hmm.

Tell me, when's the last time
you made me anything?

Uh, never.

(LAUGHS)
MIKE: Oh, wow, okay.

Oh, my God, moms, right?

Look, um...

I know that people
have probably been

talking to you about me,

but, uh, don't believe
everything you hear.

You know, this neighborhood
has a lot of bad influences.

You know what I mean?

People like to keep
their mouth shut.

You know,
thinking they need to fit in,

but fitting in
isn't always a good thing.

You know what I mean?

Gotta be careful
who you hanging around

in a place like this.

(ANDY PANTING)

When you get a bit older
and you start to realize

that it's just...
