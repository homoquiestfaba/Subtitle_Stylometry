I look good, baby.

Yeah, you do, baby.

Hm.

Baby.

Let's go cause some trouble.

This might go south. We need backup.

What if somebody gets killed
because of the product they're selling?

What if you die?

It doesn't matter.
Look.

I've been chasing their boss forever.

Yeah, so maybe it's time to do
something different for once.

You with me?
Yeah, I'm with you.

I'm gonna go in after these guys.
I'm not letting these guys go.

I'm with you! I'm with you.
All right, let's go! Come on!

Don't make Mama Bear
get fucking pissed off...

Yeah, this whole deal
is bullshit. Bullshit!

Gotta get out of here!
Let's go! Let's go!

<i>I'm not leaving you!</i>
<i>Go!</i>

<i>They're not gonna get away with this.</i>
<i>Run!</i>

Goddamn!

A flesh wound's not
supposed to hurt this bad! Is it? Ah!

Hold on, baby!

Motherfucker.

He's right behind us!
Shit!

You and me
against the world.

It's you and me against
the world, baby!

<i>Hey, Eric.</i>

<i>If you're listening to this...</i>

<i>Look, man, I...</i>

<i>I know it's a tough time.</i>

<i>With Hannah's funeral over
with, I...</i>

<i>I'm gonna
come up later to talk.</i>

<i>Make sure you're doing okay.</i>

<i>All right. I'll see you then.</i>

You can't drop me!
I'm a bunny!

I'm a good bunny too!

I'm your best friend!

You just dropped me on the ground!

Eric, be careful.
Hold up!

I got this, I got it, I got it.
Oh, there we go now.

I love you.
I love you.

Eric, look out!

All right, go! Go, go, go!

I can't get the call through!

Damn it!

Hello? Is anybody in there?

Help! Hello!

He's coming.
Fuck!

Ah! Goddamn it!

Get the door!

Oh, shit!

Oh!

I'll kill you!

Ah!

Come on, big boy! Come on, big boy!

Come on, you wanna fucking dance? Huh?

No! No, no, no!

No! You let her go!

No, you let her go! You let her go, pig!

Don't you touch my baby.

Get down here, Mickey, it's over!

You all need to leave.

Please, mister, he got a knife.

He's got my girl. He got me in the arm...

Stupid ass.

That was nice.

You'd be doing me a favor.

Seriously?

You're an interesting fella.

We got ourselves an odd duck
in our pond, baby girl!

Let him go!
You move, big boy,

and he dies all over you.
Wet and red!

What are you people doing here?

Oh. Me and Violet,

we just a couple of lovebirds
looking for a nest.

Location, location, location.

Now, I'm gonna need you
to do me a straight solid.

Reach into my pocket, get the cell phone.

You watch that trigger, Mickey!

Shut up!

Come on, Mr. Quackers.
Get my cell phone.

I told you, let him go!
Who are you?

I'm a cop. It's fine.
Get my goddamn cell phone!

Where is it?
Front left pocket.

There you go. Oh! There you go.

Easy, boy.

Don't get any ideas. He's not your type.

You and me against the world, baby.

You and me against the world, baby!

I love you.
Just do it.

All right now.

Just push... push my last text.

Yeah. There you go.

Now, uh, send the location.

I use a home phone. I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

The thing that looks like a paperclip!

A little round fucking paperclip.

Yeah, that's it. That's it.

The second you pull that trigger,

I'm putting this knife right
into your girlfriend's throat.

Okay.

Pass it back, Mr. Quackers.
Come on. Pass it back.

Pass it back!

Yeah, no, no. We don't want anybody to see
what we're gonna do to him.

It's nothing compared
to what we did to your partner.

Mm!
Fuck you!

Yeah.

Stop!

You let him walk down those stairs
and out the front door,

and I'll follow with Violet.
Don't listen to him!

Don't make me fucking hurt you!
All right?

Let him walk down the stairs, and when we
get to the door, we all release.

Why would I do that, big boy,

when we can just sit back
and chillax, huh?

You think they'll be here quick enough?

Quick enough? No.

They've been tracking us since we...
since we split the warehouse.

Friends and family plan, son.
Ooh, it's good for the kids.

Gave them the final destination.
It's gonna be a hell of a reunion.

Let him walk down the stairs,
and we'll finish this later.

Come on.

Just shoot him!

I'm not gonna let him hurt you, baby.

Walk down the stairs.

Yeah!

Move, ducky!

See you soon.

You okay?

You get him?
Not enough!

Oh, my God!

Find him! Where is he?

Come on, big boy!

Goddamn it!

Check his house for ammo.
I'm gonna check his car.

What the fuck?
Dude! Shut up!

They're gonna hear you, all right?

I need you to get to safety. Now.

Look, this is my farm.
They don't belong here.

Shit, you don't belong here.
Why would I be the one...

You need to get the hell out of here.

These people will kill you.

I think I did a pretty good job
taking care of myself back there.

Almost got us both killed.

Is there anybody else here?

Anybody else that might come here?
A wife, maybe kids?

Just me.

You really don't have a cell?

No need.

No one to call.

Who needs to be quiet now?

Comes in handy, don't it?

Listen.

Is there only one road on the farm?

No, I got a back road
down there through the brush.

Takes you to the main drag.

Good. I need you
to head through the brush,

and back to town.

Understand?

I'm not going anywhere.
I don't have time for this.

It seems to me
you might be able to use a little backup

until your police friends get here.

No one else is coming.
Not to help, at least.

You need to run.
This is my fight, not yours.

Run? This is my farm. Not yours.

You heard them mention my partner?

He was a cop for 30 years.

He knew what he was doing
when they killed him.

I'm sorry. I may not get
another chance like this.

Go to the road, and head to town. Now!

Sounds about right.

Yeah, he ain't
calling the cavalry anytime soon.

Angel!
Yeah?

How do you load one of these things?
I'll show you, sugar plum.

You... you just...
you get it on her back.

And then you just put it in.
Nice and easy.

Hold that. Ow!

Man, I...

Frank.

Yeah, Frank?
<i>Three minutes.</i>

Get ready.

You telling me what to do?

Uh, "yeah, get ready."

Well, if he thinks that he's gonna be
using this...

he better think again.

Pew! Hal
Looks good on you.

Get some practice shots!

Make them count, baby girl.

Bang!

Bang. Mickey, I think
I'm getting the hang of this thing!

Come on. Move!

Shit!

Leave my farm.

All right.

Yo, boss, do you see that?
Park here.

This is my farm.

Do you see something, sir?

Do you need me to flush out the area?
Because I...

Bang! Bang!

Bang!

Look, all's I'm saying is this.
It's the 21st century,

and y'all living under a monarchy
like it's the Middle Ages.

Excuse me, mate, we're very lucky
to have a monarch.

Closest you guys ever came
to a monarch is Elvis,

and you know what they said
about Elvis, right?

Okay, fish sticks, you hold
your horses right there.

Don't you blaspheme about the King.

Well, maybe you don't say
anything about the Queen.

Fine. Deal.
Deal?

Now, we're all gonna shut the fuck up.

You do realize that we have the guns?

Yes.
Okay.

Sir, we're wasting time.
It was probably a bird.

What? Oh, shit!

Goddamn, woman!

You make me hard with a gun
in your hand, girl.

He's down there, baby.
We're gonna get him!

Let's go get the bad man.

Cal, run!

It's no bird.

Get in there.

I don't mean to be a burr
under your saddle, boss,

but are we fixing to get out of here
any time soon...?

All of you.

Get in there.

Fuck, it's hot.

You good?

You got this, baby.
I got this.

What the fuck? Pussy. Come on, let's go.

Guns up, guys, come on!

Where the hell is he?
Oh, he's close.

Frank.
Frank.

Goddamn it.

All right. All right.

David?

Get the fuck off me!

You think I'm gonna run?

Put that fucking gun down!

Why are you wasting my time?

Just kill me.

I'm not gonna devolve myself
to such behavior.

You're my prisoner till my boss gets here.

Perhaps he will allow you the luxury.

I hear you two have quite a history.

Yes.

Take him in there. See to his wound.

We may need him ready
to move at any point.

Yes, sir. All right.

Tyson, Lisa.

Move these cars
and hide them somewhere.

We don't wanna show anybody

who might happen to stumble
upon this shithole that we're here.

Would we?
Got you, boss.

Copy.

How the fuck are we supposed
to see to his wound?

I'm not a doctor, Ed. I'm not a nurse.
I haven't got medical training, have 1?

You remind me more of a candy striper.

What the fuck's that mean?

Well, it's like a nurse
without medical training.

Why are you being such a hillbilly today?

I'm not a hillbilly. I'm a redneck.

What's the difference?

Generally speaking,
we don't sleep with our sisters.

Busy searching the area, I see.
Been there, done that.

Got the bloody t-shirt for it. I'm good.

Mickey?
Hm?

Tell me, where's the other cop?

Oh, he's close. Mm-hmm.
Close. With the farmer.

Mm, maybe.
Maybe.

Shut up.

He might be with a farmer?
Mm.

So what you're saying is
that a man is running around,

someone who might be with a cop,

but you have no idea. Either of you.

Are they injured?
Yeah.

No. They're not seriously injured.

Are they armed?
No. They're not armed.

Mm-mm.
Spoke to your brother, Mickey.

He's on his way.
Step-brother.

Step-brother.
Why is he on his way here?

He's curious as to how
this happened, as am I.

See? But you were there, Francis.

You saw the whole thing go down.

Remember?
Boom boom? Bang bang?

You were shooting at the guy.

That was you! It was him!

It... it was me.

And I know I wasn't followed
to the warehouse.

I know I wasn't followed here.

And I know I have the cop I was left with
under control.

Hmm.
So I'm gonna wait for an answer.

You both can tell me. Where's yours?

We'll handle it.
He's around here somewhere.

Sneaky. Sneaky.
Sneaky.

You should get on it, then.
I'll get on that.

Do you think he wears lifts?

He looks like he wears lifts.

Bye, buddy.

In there!

Pretty sure
they're gonna come in here.

Yeah, they will.

Please tell me you have more guns?

Uh, my wife isn't, uh...

wasn't a fan.

I'm sure we can make something work.

Go hide in the comer,
I'll take care of them if they come in.

Go.
Fuck that.

You go hide in the corner.

What?
You wanna die?

I've looked death in the face
more times than I can count.

At this point, we're old friends.

Never need an excuse
to see an old friend, now do 1?

Where's your gun?
I didn't bring one.

Oh, my God.

What the fuck were you thinking?

Can one of you guys
loan him one of your guns?

Fuck that, this is mine.

Okay, check the area
and make sure he didn't get away. Fuck.

I'm fine.
Just stay behind me.

Fuck! Come on!

Jesus!

Fuck!

Who the fuck was that other guy?

They killed Rob!

Frank.
What?

What are you doing?
Having a senior moment?

I have to know this place
because you can bet your ass he does.

Who?

The farmer, you morons.

You know, Frank,
I know you think you're in charge,

but we're just as important.
As what?

Do you both think
you're as integral as me?

Yeah.
Absolutely.

We're gonna get one thing straight.

We are colleagues, not friends.

Coming here to help your sorry asses
was nothing more than a business decision.

And like you said...

the boss is only your stepbrother.

And don't you think for one second
that I am not fully aware

of just how frayed and fragile
that relationship truly is.

Rethink your importance, my friend.

Or I sure as well will.

Frank!

Yes?
It's Rob.

What about Rob?

He's dead.

He's a dick.

I'm gonna kill every one of those fuckers.

Listen...
No, you listen to me, all right?

They have my partner.

Who the fuck are these guys?

They're drug dealers. Scumbags.

My partner and I have been
chasing them for years.

Finally got close enough this morning.

I know what they're capable of.

I know what their product
does to normal people.

Went into that warehouse,
and, well, shit hit the fan.

Here we are.

Is there really nobody else here?

No, it's, uh...

Hannah... My wife.

<i>She and I used to run
the place together, and, uh...</i>

I did a tour in Iraq.

Grenade went off next to me,
and put me in a body cast for a year.

And, uh, I had a nurse.

She brought me back, you know.

She nursed me back to health,
took care of me.

She was my angel.

That was Hannah.

I remember, uh, I was laying in that bed

and, uh, I made a promise to God.

I said, uh,

"Man, if I ever get out of this cast,

I'm gonna marry that woman.

I'm never gonna kill again."

I mean, before that,
I was a shell of the man I used to be.

I was a fucking disaster,

and, uh...

And then she came into my life.

She filled me up.

She made me feel alive.

<i>Gave me a daughter.</i>

She died two weeks ago.

Eric, look out!

My daughter too.

And I just quit, you know.

On life, on, uh... On everything.

I mean, what's the fucking point, right?

Hence, the, uh...

I'm sorry, man.

I really am.

I gotta finish this.

You have a house phone?

In the kitchen.

Good.

I'm gonna go to the house,

get to the phone and get David, all right?

I'm going with you.

I'm finishing this alone.

I've been in this situation enough times
to know that you need my help.

Even if you're too damn
stubborn to know it.

And that's the house
that I shared with my wife.

It's my house.

And it's all I've got left.

And fuck, I ain't got
nothing to live for anyway.

All right.

Well, this is certainly a development.

A development? That's Rob.

No, it was Rob.

It would still be if any of you knew

how to handle your jobs
for a good goddamn minute.

Frank, we didn't know we'd die doing this.

We came here to kill.

Or did any of you not
get the memo on that?

Because evidently, this cop did.

We're wasting fucking time, man.

No, we're wasting fucking friends, Mickey.

Oh, you're killing me, Smalls.

Mickey.
Yeah?

For once, I agree.

Lisa...

come here.

I can't, Frank.

Lisa, if you would...

Now.

Sorry for the mess.

Do you fancy leaving here
with Liam and the gang, Lisa?

No. I want him dead.

You want him dead.

Yes.

Of course you do.

Well, then it's settled.

We kill or be killed. Is that clear?

Boo-yah!

Get your asses out of here.

Let's move.

On your six.

I want nobody
going off on their own.

We'll stay together
with somebody at all times.

Liam, that's you and me...

Go to the phone, call for backup. Go.

...that way. He's up there! Get him!

Fuck, get him!

Shouldn't we be going after him?

Listen to me. Get him back.

I don't give a shit what you
have to do with the farmer.

Both of those cops need to be
in that house when Michael arrives.

You mean the cop you shot.
Yes.

The one we now have in custody.

The one that you went after is now giving
us chase around the fucking farm.

They followed you here, Mickey.
Don't you ever forget that.

So what are you gonna be doing?

Finding out what the other one knows.

The more people get killed,
the more all of us look bad.

Oh, one more thing, Mickey.

Your stepbrother is not someone
any of us wanna look bad to.

Got it?

Are you sure you tied him up good?

Yes, Ed, I'm sure.
I'm sorry.

You don't remember that jockey in Fresno

that weaseled out of them ropes you tied,
goes running down the street?

That was partially my fault.
That was partially your fault.

All right, fair.
You two suck.

Officer.
It's Detective.

You two don't seem
to be having much fun here.

They suck.

Thank you.

Ah, yes, of course.

Detective Watson.

So nice to finally make
your acquaintance, indeed.

I've been told a lot about you before.

Ed...

Move the cop's and Violet's cars.

We don't want anything
looking out of place, do we?

Yes, sir.

And do it quietly, Ed.

They'll hear the gunshots.

You mean the gunshots on a private farm
in the middle of nowhere?

I think there is a certain word for that.

Right, Detective?

"Legal."

Now, my boss is on his way.

So rather than all this bullshit,
let's see what he has to say. Shall we?

Michael, hello.
<i>What's going on?</i>

I'm sitting here with our good friend,
David Watson.

<i>Watson. Put me on loudspeaker.</i>

Well, hello. Is that you, Detective?

It's been a while.

<i>I see you've taken over for Daddy.</i>

Oh, yeah, and what
a glorious day to do it.

<i>Oh, my God!
I missed you, buddy.</i>

I can't wait to see your face
in this helpless position.

After all these years
terrorizing my family,

chasing us and chasing us.

<i>And here you are. Oops!</i>

<i>You belong to me now, cupcake.</i>

Crazy old world.
<i>Indeed.</i>

Hey, I'll make sure Frank
takes good care of you until I arrive.

<i>We'll hang out, we'll chitchat.</i>

<i>Prepare yourself,</i>

because I'm gonna pick your brain.

Bite me!

Well, this sure as shit isn't
how I figured life would work out.

Damn it, I gotta be dumber
than a bag of hammers.

Mama wanted me to go to law school,
but no, I just had to do this, didn't I?

I don't know what the hell this is.
Here I am, moving cars.

Obviously, I'm a valet.
I'll give myself some tips.

Talking to myself...

get myself some therapy while I'm at.

Come on now, Ed,
get your head in the game, boy.

What a fucking idiot.

Shit.

Fuck!

"Ed, go shoot this guy!
Then go bury his body."

Hold on, Michael.

Damn it. God!

Stupid car.

What the hell are you doing?

Oh, hey, Frank.

Uh, well, let's see.

First, the car is a piece of shit.

And second, thank you.

I'm fine. Don't worry about me, I'm good.

Just shut up, Ed!

Only the best for your team.
Michael. What was that?

I don't care how much
you have to hurt the asshole.

Just make him talk.

All right. Copy.

English, hurt him...

while I get my tools, please?

Well...

Now, let's try this again, shall we?

Shit! Owl Damn it.

You know, I'm done!
I'm done with this bullshit!

This is ridiculous!

I'm a grown-ass man
crawling over damn cars.

Shit! I could've been a lawyer.

Mickey.
Violet?

That law dog.

He ain't gunning for justice.
He's gunning for blood.

It ain't our first rodeo, baby.

Yeah.

Tell that to your bullet holes.

Yeah, he took his pound of flesh.

I'm still raring to cha-cha.

Come on, let's go put some silver
on his eyes and send him downriver.

You and me forever, baby.
Against the world.

You and me against the world.

Hey, hey.

Where's Tyson?

Tyson, where you at, man?

Get up here, all of you.

Wait, there's something over there.

Everyone stop. Stop.

Paul, Lisa, get up here.

I want you two to look up there.

Split up. You go left, Lisa. You go right.

Copy.

Don't waste time. Get up there. Now.

Liam.
Yeah?

You remember that turn back there
that goes to the right?

Yes.
We're gonna double back,

you're gonna go to the left,
I'm gonna go to the right.

You ready? Now.
Copy that.

Now. Go.

Ed, English.
Hit him in the stomach.

His face is mine.

I really have to hand it to you,
Detective.

You are one tough son of a bitch,
I must say.

Mind that. Mind the wrinkles, please.

Couch.
Sure.

And pushing retirement, I imagine.

What the hell are you doing, getting
yourself into situations like that?

I'm not old. But my partner
is a little young.

Ah. Where fools rush in.

I certainly know a few people
like that myself.

I'm more of the, um...

How would you call it?

The calculating one.

What about Violet and Mickey?

Don't worry about that, Detective.

Yes, those two imbeciles
are quite foolish.

I expect you and I
aren't so different, however.

Similar levels
and not so dissimilar organizations.

I'm nothing like you. Nothing!

I'm just doing my job, Detective.

The passionate ones are out there,
running around, waving guns at each other.

It's... unbecoming.

You think you're like me?

You think you're better than me?

You need guys like me.

And I suppose...

in some ways...

I need guys like you.

Crime pays for us both, Detective.

You see,

we are a dying breed.

Unfortunately for you...

Ah...

...sooner rather than later, I'm afraid.

Hey, asshole.

Who are these two idiots?

I got shot today.

And I'm tied up.

And you still hit like a bitch.

Do you think that I'm that stupid
to sit here with you alone?

I just think you're a coward.

You know, not many know this.

But I am an artist.

And I'm going to make you
my finest work.

Yeah.

The screams alone
will bring your partner to me.

You think he's that stupid?
Shall we begin?

Shit.

Hey, jackass.

Don't walk away from me.

Watch him.

Does this mean we're not
fucking up his face?

Put the phone down.

You're in my house.

<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>
Ed?

<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

Put your hands up, boss,
real slow. Come on, now.

Andrew.

Get rid of him.

Goddamn it.

You got company?

Get rid of him.

Uh... neighbor's car.

Letting him park here overnight.

How you been?

I'm busy.

Right.

Uh... you know, Andrew, it's, uh...

it's really not a good time right now.

Yeah, lately it never is.

You get my message?

What do you say I, uh, come up here
for a little while,

help you finish fixing the place up?

Might do you some good.

I won't even charge you.

Hey, hey, hey!

Knock it off.

Andrew, I can't have this today.

Okay? It's not the time.
I need you to leave.

Look, I know how you feel.

Really, I do.

You have no idea how I feel.

I'm just saying that being here alone
all the time ain't good for you.

You still got friends who care about you.

I'm gonna be the guy
that's gonna kill you.

Yeah, I wanna be
that guy right now, Andrew.

But I need you to get
the fuck off my land.

You hear me?

Go.

Andrew, just go. Please.

Not today.

All right.

Try it again next week.

Wait!

What the hell?
Run. Run! Run!

Sorry. Wrong place, wrong time.

Shit!

Andrew!

Shit.

Ed!

Hey, hey!

Shit!

Son of a bitch!

Hey! Let it go! Let it go! Let go!

Put it down.
I'm gonna shoot you.

Put it on the floor.
No.

And I'll let you go.

Jesus Christ, what the hell's going on?

Get off!

Christ!

You think you're gonna get away? Huh?

Maybe not.

But he might.

You keep your eyes on him.

Step aside, Lisa. I got this.

He's over there.
I see him.

I think I got him!

You stupid fucking idiot.
What the hell's the matter with you?

Frank, we discussed this, all right? It's
hurtful when you talk to me like that.

I tried my best. Hell...

Where is your head?

Where is your head?!
Okay, you need to take a yoga class.

I don't need to do a fucking thing!

You're gonna listen to me.
Get in that car.

Get your ass in that fucking...
Get in the car!

Get in the car and shut your mouth!
Decaf.

Shut... you... what?
I'm just saying.

What? Shut up!
Sleep better.

Here, piggy, piggy, piggy.

Piggy, piggy.

We've got you now, pig!

What are you gonna do now, cop?

Can't let you guys go!

Let us go?

Three of us, one of you!
What do you mean by "let us go"?

Second one of you guys misses,
the other one dies. I promise you that!

Fuck you!
No, baby!

Got you now, you bastard!

Hey...

You and me... you and me.

Hey...
You and me against the world, baby.

Baby?

Baby!

Baby?

Baby?

I got you now!

Stop!

Frank?

Get in!

Go, man, go!

Thanks for saving my ass.
No problem.

That was some driving back there.

I used to drive a Jeep.
Yeah, where's that?

I don't have it anymore.
Let's go save David.

Drivel

Where's Mickey?

Don't.

Right, he's going for the house.

What about the other cop?

Shit!

Damn, they're right on us.

Jesus Christ! Try and shoot him!

Come on! Ah!

Ah! Come on! Goddamn it!

Fuck! Come on!

Seatbelt!

Come on!

All right, get ready.

I got it, I got it! I got it!

What the fuck was that?

Sounds like a crash.

You shut up.
Calm down.

Shut up.

I think somebody should help.

No, I'm not leaving you here on your own!

You can carry me.

No, I'm not gonna fucking carry you!

We're just gonna stay here,
and Frank, or Ed,

or someone's gonna be back in a minute
and tell us what to do!

Frank? Somebody talk to me!

You know what? Fuck you.

Eric. Eric, wake up.

<i>Wake up.</i>

This is for Mickey!

Hey. Snap out of it.

<i>It's not your time.</i>

<i>I love you.</i>

I'm in charge, okay? I'll say... I put
my foot down! I'm saying what's happening!

What you're gonna do is put that gun down.

Oh, yeah?

Why don't you come make me put it down?

Hm?

I'm gonna have to kill you.

Stop saying that. Stop saying that. Hey.

Hey, no. No.

I was joking. So sit your...
sit your ass down on the chair.

Come on, now, come on.

We've done this. We've done this.

Just give me the gun.

Now, listen. Until Frank gets back,
I'm in charge.

That's the deal, okay?

So you park your ass on that chair
and then we're all gonna be mates.

You wanna sit down?
I do wanna sit down. Yeah.

Have a cup of tea?

Just give me the pacifier.

I'm only sitting down if you sit down.

I'll be happy to sit down.

I'm just gonna...
I'm probably just gonna...

like a squat, sort of...

So that I'm ready, you know, for anything.

Like a... like a panther.

Let's go, man. Come on.

Frank, I could really do
with some help in here!

You see this chair right here?

You see this chair?
Yeah?

All right.
Hey, hey.

I want you to get the fuck out of here!

And put that gun down.
Put the chair down.

Sit the fuck down!

Sit down!

Fucking... Get off me!

I got a charity to be at.
Let's make this quick.

The fuck!

I told you I was gonna kill you.

Just do it, you fucking cunt!

You're under arrest.

I'm not too sure about that.

Well, well, well.

Isn't it nice to see
the likes of you again?

You're looking nice and dapper.

All right.

I'm in a hurry.

So if you want this to go smooth,

please enlighten me.

Where are the other two?

You hurt?

Oh, no. I'm just peachy.

I gotta go.

I gotta save David.

I know.

I got your back.

You're not going alone.

Let's go get David.

Let's go save him.

No man left behind.

You left me in the car back there.

You might need this.
Oh! Yep.

Ah!

Well, I've gotta say,

I didn't expect a shit show
quite like this.

I thought we could contain it, Michael.

You thought? But evidently
you don't think nearly enough.

Where's Mickey?

That other fucking cop killed him.

He shot him dead.

Calm yourself.

But he was your brother.

He was my stepbrother. Distant.

And I'm sure he made that
abundantly clear to you.

Nonetheless,
it's a terrible thing.

Someone needs
to be severely punished.

It's a miracle
we aren't inundated with cops.

You sloppy fucks!

Get the fuck off me!

I'm sorry.

You work for this guy?

You trust him?

This guy?

Turn on him!

I'll protect you.

Oh, good one.

And you, Frank. My goodness.

All these years.

I counted on you. I trusted you.
I gave you a chance.

And this is
what I walk into today.

Really?

These guys made you
look like a fucking joke.

I said I was sorry, Michael.

Excuse me?

You might not live to give another apology
in your fucking life!

Do what you're told, take my orders,

and keep your fucking mouth shut.

Understand?
Yes.

Do I need to ask you
to fucking bark for me?

Run, Cal, you idiot!

Well,
that didn't take very long.

This ends... now.

No.

Leave the kid.

Take me!

What would my mother say

if I didn't at least try
to avenge my stepbrother?

Hmm?

This is my farm, bitches.

Cal!

Shit!

Kill them! After them!

I've got personal business with him!

Get up. Lisa, Frank, to the right! Move!

Thomas, get your ass to the left, go!

Holy shit, that worked.
Nice shot.

Upstairs.
Let's go. Yeah.

Oh, shit!

So much for no killing.

Oh, David.

Don't be afraid.

Come out, come out, wherever you are.

You rock that pathetic,
shiny, little badge?

False righteousness.

You know nothing of real honor.

What you did to my family...

Hoo-hoo-hoo...

You're in my custody now.

Hey, Michael.

Keep those bullets, buddy.

Well, guess what? This last one
has your name on it.

You know I'll be out in a week.

Say good night.

Shit.

Hey.

Drop it!

Run, you idiot!

Go. Go, go, go!

Fucking piece of shit!

Ah!

You ready to see your wife?

She'd rather wait.

Ah!

You okay?

I'm gonna take the stairs.

There you are! Shit.

Looks like you're out.

Not today, sweetheart. Come here.

Oh! Oh, well...

looks like I might
have to do another remodel.

Yeah. Sorry about that.

Eh, it's okay.

I didn't really care
for that wallpaper anyway.

Thanks for the help.

Name's Eric, by the way.

Nice to meet you.
Cal.

Stop talking. I didn't do anything.
Shut up.

Tell it to the judge.

I'm calling my lawyer.

What are you doing?
Hell of a day, isn't it, partner?

You got insurance?

Because your house is shot to shit.

Yeah.

I got shot today.
So did I.
