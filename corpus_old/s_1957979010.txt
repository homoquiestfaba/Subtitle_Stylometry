Yeah, she needs to be on
set on Monday for that,

so make sure everything goes okay.

(birds chirping)

Okay.

Yeah, sounds good.

(John sighs)

Yeah, we just pulled up.

Yeah, it like two hours away.

(John groans)

Cool, okay, keep me posted.
Come on,

it's time to unplug.

You're gonna love it.

Yeah, I, uh, I'll be here until Monday,

so service seems to be fine.

Um, just call me, let me
know if you need anything.

(John exhales sharply)

Yeah.

Okay, talk soon, bye.

Call if you need anything,

come on, baby, it's
supposed to be our time.

I love you and I'm very
happy to be here with you,

but just, just don't, okay?

All right. (zips zipping)

(Rebecca sighs)

See, isn't this great?

Yeah, no, it's lovely.
Yeah.

Thank you for doing this.

especially for unplugging.

John, you know this is just-
Hey, no, seriously,

I meant that sincerely.

And as much as you can be
present, I'm appreciative of.

(alarm beeping) (door squeaking)


Not bad.
Not bad.


Ah! (gasps) Baby.

Ah?

This is exactly what
I've been needing. (laughs)

Baby.
(laughs) Yeah?

I will tell you what
you've been needing.

Oh, boy! (giggles)

(Rebecca giggles)
Drinks.

Mm, music.
On it.



Glasses, glassware.
(birds chirping)

(wind whooshing)

(branches rustling)

(birds chirping)


Yeah, it is.

(Rebecca chuckles)

You know, we should do this
with Paul and Danielle sometime.

Like a, Like a couples getaway.

Yeah, it's a good idea.

But I'm glad that we get
to do this together first.

Mm?
Mm-hmm.

Me too.

Wait, should we break
in every room as we go?

Ooh, is that a challenge?
Maybe.

Maybe after you make a proper
cocktail, we can discuss.

are you extorting me

for my cocktail making abilities?

That's kinda the only
reason we're together.

Is it? (Rebecca laughs)

(John sighs)

Mm.

(exhales sharply) I love it up here.

Yeah, me too.

Isn't there another bedroom downstairs?

Yeah, there's a few.

Let's check 'em out.
All right.

Didn't realize this
place had so many bedrooms.

Yeah, it's not bad.

Should I go grab our bags?

No, let's just chill and
have a drink for a bit.

Perfect.
Okay.


Yeah.
Cool.

Hey, do you remember
where you put the speaker?

Oh, it's in your backpack.

Okay.

What'll it be?

Um, surprise me.
(speaker beeps)

Okay.

Uh-huh.

(upbeat music) (Rebecca laughs)

Huh?
You and this man.

You know you love it.

Ah, always makes me wanna cook.


That'd be great.

â™ª Got you feeling nothing â™ª
I'll go grab our things.

â™ª When my lover's near â™ª
Awesome.

â™ª Lord, let this â™ª

(bags rustling)

Oh, geez.
Whoa.

Hey, I'm sorry.
What the fuck, man?

I just wanted to,

I do apologize.
Who are you?

I'm Ben.
Ben?

I'm the caretaker, the groundskeeper,

whatever you wanna call me.

I just live up the way,
I saw you guys drive in,

so I wanted to come introduce myself

and let you know that I'm
here should you need anything.

All right, um, yeah,
so, sorry, man, you, uh,

caught me off guard there.
Yeah,

sorry about that. (laughs)
But I appreciate

you letting us know you're here.

Okay.
But, uh, we're good, man.

Um, we have everything
we need, love this place.

Well, I'm so glad to hear that.

And again, I'm really sorry
I didn't mean to scare you.

No, it's, it's fine, man, really.

You know what?

It looks like you guys are
running low on firewood.

How about I chop you some?

Oh, no, no, no, man.
Come on, no, no, no, no, no.

Come on, I don't wanna
get off on the wrong foot.

Let me do this for you,
it'll make me feel better.

Listen, I won't even bother you,

I'll just leave it by the front door.

Uh.

Sure.

Appreciate that.

Really, it's nothing at all.
(gentle suspenseful music)

Y'all enjoy your stay now.
(suspenseful music)

Thanks, again.
(door squeaking)

Were you talking to someone?

Yeah, it's just a really
creepy old groundskeeper guy.

Oh.
Scared the shit out of me.



he was just welcoming us
and introducing himself.

Weird.
Hm.

Uh, anyways, what all do
you need for dinner tonight?

Okay, I need one of the
onions and then ground beef,

chorizo, tomatoes, pasta,

pasta sauce, and then
whatever veg you want tonight.

Oh, really?

Whatever veggie I want?
Yes.

You get to-Ah, I get to choose?

Yes, (laughs) yes.

Hey, thank you for this.

Thank you.

(birds chirping)

Okay, how about you go sit down, relax,

and pick out whatever terrifying movie

you're gonna make us watch tonight.

Hey, this is not solely my tradition.

Okay, I don't like it anymore than you do.

So then why do we do this to ourselves?



Here.

Here, move it, I'll get it.

I know how sensitive you are with onions.

Mm, thank you.

Of course.

Hey, should I make us a cocktail?

Yes, please, uh, I didn't
bring the bar in yet though.

I'll go get it.

Perfect.
Okay.

(car beeping) (birds chirping)

(zip zipping)

(footsteps rustling)

(birds chirping)

(wind whistling)

(wind whooshing)

(calm upbeat music)

Okay, what are we drinking?

I'll make it.

How about a martini?

Ooh, whenever you want.

Mm-hmm.

Although, being up
in the woods like this

does put me in the mood
for a whiskey something.

for a whiskey something.

Yeah?
Yeah.

All right.

chopping these, baby.

for doing everything else.


â™ª Where did you go â™ª

â™ª Oh, baby â™ª

All right, I'm gonna make a
Manhattan, sound good to you?

Yeah, as long as you don't
let me have six of them.

that was hardly my fault.

I had just as many as you had.

And I blame that bartender.

Some people are just
too good at their jobs

for public health.
Yeah, yeah.

So if you don't have
at least six of mine,

I'm gonna be offended.

(Rebecca laughs)

Thought I was your favorite bartender.

Ah, you are.

Especially because your
drinks are free. (laughs)

I was doing it right.

Now,

we'll see.

Yeah.

â™ª Ooh, ooh, ooh â™ª

â™ª Ooh, ooh, ooh â™ª

Nice.
Two.

Cheers.

Cheers.

To us.
To us.

â™ª You're leaving â™ª

â™ª When I need â™ª
Mm.

â™ª You the most â™ª
(John whistles)

Good. (laughs)
Yeah.

All right, I'm gonna enjoy
this drink on the back deck,

Okay.
Enjoy the view,

you should join me.

Ah, let me just get this
sauce going a little bit

and then I'll meet you out there.

All right.
â™ª Hold on to things that â™ª

(birds chirping)

(lighter clicking)

(John breathes deeply)

Wow.

(grinder crunching)

(salt rustling)

(door squeaks)

Okay, the sauce will be
good to simmer for a bit.

Nice.
Mm-hmm.

Thank you.
Yeah.

Ah.

(Rebecca coughs)

(both laugh)

Oof, I love it out here. (laughs)

It's nice, huh?
Yeah.

Oh, wanna mention, What's that?

We forgot the key ingredient
to our dinner tonight

at the store.

The pasta.
Ugh.

(Rebecca laughs)

Dammit, really?
Yeah. (laughs)

Okay, not a problem,

I'll run to the store
and grab it real quick.

No, it's okay, baby.

I'll go with you.
No, seriously.

Here, I'll be back before you know it.

Thank you.
(gentle suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music continues)

â™ª With you the sun is shining 24/7 â™ª

â™ª 'Cause when we're together â™ª

â™ª It feels like we're in heaven â™ª

â™ª If it will get dark,
you'll be my million stars â™ª

â™ª I know I can lean on you â™ª

â™ª Ooh, you catch me like a

In a press conference today,
(gentle suspenseful music)

the mayor has announced the reopening

of the North Trail to the public.

This renovation has requested
twice the time and budget

that the town had initially approved

due to the pressure of the citizen.

â™ª I do, do, do, do, I wanna marry you â™ª

â™ª 'Cause when you're around â™ª

â™ª I know it's true the way â™ª

â™ª You make me feel is so
good, baby, so good, so good â™ª

(suspenseful music)
The city board stated

in their press release that the decision

to increase the budget
has allowed to rebuild

the old fence and secure the whole area,

which is commonly used for walks and hikes

by family and tourists.

The opposition party had run a campaign

for the measure to be assessed
to prevent more accidents

similar to the one that
caused a major concern

in the public opinion last year.

When 23-year-old Caroline Dunnit slipped

and fell off the trail while running,

which nearly cost her her life.

The mayor allegedly ordered the variation

to contrast the growing popularity
of the opposition leader

who is expected to run for mayor

in the city election next year.

The press office of the
mayor has denied the rumor.

â™ª Sugar on my misery â™ª

â™ª And I don't fake this kind of feeling â™ª

â™ª Never felt so real â™ª
(Rebecca gasps)

â™ª My heart is on the table
'cause you're my everything â™ª

â™ª I do, do, do, do, do, I â™ª

(suspenseful music continues)

(suspenseful music continues)

(car engine revs)



(dramatic suspenseful music)


I'm so sorry, I, I
didn't mean to startle you.

What do you want?
I'm Ben.

I met your husband out front.

I told him I'd bring you some firewood.

I'm the caretaker.
(gentle suspenseful music)

just knock at the front door?

I know, I know, I probably should've,

I just, I had this whole bundle
of wood that I was carrying.

you just really scared me.

Again, I'm sorry.

I'll just pile this wood
up and I'll be on my way.

It's okay, you just
caught me off guard is all.


I saw your car drive down the road,

so I assumed that you
guys would both be out

and that this would be a good
time to drop the wood off.

Yeah, no, that makes perfect sense.

Sorry for my reaction.

Are you okay there?

Oh, uh, yes, yeah.

I just, I cut myself cooking dinner.

Well, be careful there.

There's a lotta things out
here that wanna kill you.

What?


you should get that cleaned up.

It's easy to get an infection.

You got a first aid kit in there with you?

I'm not sure.

Well, you know, I could
run home and grab some stuff

for you and come back if you like.

No, no, no need, um, I'm
sure we have stuff around here.

I just haven't had a chance to look yet.

Uh, there's no need for you
to come back, we're good.

Okay.

Well, that should do you then,

(Ben exhales sharply)
Mm-hmm.

Should be plenty for the next few days.

But, you know, if you guys
run out or you need anything,

you know, don't hesitate to call or,

you know, just come on by my place,

just, just down the road.

Mm-hmm, yeah, thank you,
it's very kind of you.

All right, no trouble at all.

Okay. Thanks, again.
Yeah, I'll see you around.

Bye. (door lock clicking)

[News Reporter] Back to your
favorite local radio station.

This is still Quote Robinson here

with my fellow community citizens.

It's Friday night.
(gentle suspenseful music)

As in the rest of the country,
we are officially in summer.

As a matter of fact, it's
been a hot summer already,

and it looks like we're going to have

a very long summer this year.

Let's keep updating you on the
unusual tropical situation,

which is predicted to reach
the peak next weekend.

Tomorrow, Sunday, and Monday,

we're going to track the skies

given the monsoon moisture from the south.

Some areas may-
(suspenseful music)

Of 71 and a maximum of 79

with sky conditions that
were almost clear and silent.

We're warning you though,
the temperature will drop

to a minimum of 65 and a maximum of 72

on Tuesday and Wednesday,
where the chances of rain

will have a peak with
an average 65% of rain.

We will then bounce back to-

(phone tapping)

(dial tone ringing)

(suspenseful music continues)

(phone ringing)

(phone beeping) (door clicks)

Who is it?

(door squeaks)

Who is it?

It's me, who do you think it is?

Sorry, I just, I got
freaked out a minute ago.

Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Wait, why do you have a knife?

'Cause that creepy
groundskeeper came by.

off to drop off the wood,

didn't he?
Yeah.

And you didn't think to
mention to your fiance,

who was here all alone, that
he might be stopping by, so.

I'm sorry, I forgot.

All right?
Yeah, and-

I'm sorry you got scared.

Did you know this
place doesn't have a TV?

Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I realized that when I got here,

but, uh, you have your laptop, right?

Yeah.
Yeah.

just got really scared.

I mean, he like came by the kitchen window

when I was at the sink and
just like came out of nowhere.

Came by the kitchen
sink., why didn't he,

why didn't he go to the front door?

He, he thought that we had left together

when you went to go get pasta
so he didn't know I was here.

Hey, hey, what's this?

Oh, nothing, I just cut myself

when I was cook-
Nothing, let me see.

It's not that bad.

Baby!
It's not that bad.

Not that bad? You almost
cut your finger off.

You're ridiculous.

Did you clean it?

I just ran water over it.

(John sighs)

(speaks faintly) All right,
look, I'm gonna get some stuff

and I'm gonna clean it
up for you, all right?

Or at least pour some whiskey over it.

(Rebecca laughs)

You could take the boy out of the south.

Hey, I heard that.
(Rebecca laughs)

(Rebecca exhales sharply)
(suspenseful music)

(Rebecca breathing heavily)

(suspenseful music continues)
(Rebecca exhales sharply)


All right. (cupboard doors thud)

(Rebecca groans)

Oh, come on, it's not
gonna hurt, all right?

Plus, we know what the
whiskey's really for, right?

let's just get it over with.

Okay, one second.

Wait, should we trust that?

Is it expired?

Do I even care?
It's fine. It's fine.

All right, just a little bit

to make sure you don't get an infection.

You ready?
Yeah.

(Rebecca groans)
Oh, you're okay.

Uh-uh.

All good.
(Rebecca breathing heavily)

All right.

Now just a quick bandaid, you'll be good.

Okay.

All right, good as new.

Although, I don't know if you
should be drinking alcohol,

you know, it's a blood thinner,

I should probably finish this for you.

Well, in that case,
(John chuckles)

Doctor Taylor

can go fuck himself.

Wow, whoa.
Mm.

Little harsh.

You know this house is expecting sex

Mm.
And we wouldn't wanna

disappoint the house now, would we?

Patience, Doctor.

Okay.

(water burbling)

(pasta rustling)

Okay, so, - Yeah.

We have about nine minutes
before the pasta's ready.

Um, so in the meantime we could...

So, what could we do in nine minutes?

Is that what you're asking?
(Rebecca laughs)

Huh?
You're such a perv.

Oh, come on, you should appreciate

my completely appropriate
level of perviness.

Hey.
That's where we're at.

Mm.

For you, yes.

Huh, you like it.
Hmm.

Shut up, John.

Or you could shut me up.

Let's see if you can make it nine minutes.

(gentle suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music continues)

(Rebecca exhales sharply)
(John breathes heavily)

So, (clears throat)

still got about six minutes
before the pasta's done.

No way.
Yeah.

(Rebecca laughs)
Oh my gosh, shit.

Shut up. (Rebecca laughs)

(car alarm blaring)

Is that the car?

(car alarm continues blaring)

(suspenseful music)

(car beeps)

Stay here.

I'm sure it's nothing.

Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

(suspenseful music continues)

(dramatic suspenseful music)

The car's fine.

I'm sure it was just a squirrel.

Nothing to worry about.

Okay, I'm gonna go drain the pasta

so it doesn't get sticky.

Come on.

(suspenseful music)
(door squeaks)

(branches rustling)

(footsteps rustling)

(dramatic suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music continues)

(metal clanking)
(water spattering)

(suspenseful music continues)

(suspenseful music continues)

(water spattering)

(dramatic suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music)

John,

dinner's ready.

(water spattering)
I'll be right up.

(John speaking faintly)


Baby?

Yeah?


Nothing, there's a pipe leaking.

I'll notify the owner in the morning.

Okay, well, come up and eat

because the pasta's getting cold.

Gotta watch a movie.

Yeah, I'll be right up.
Okay.

(dramatic suspenseful music)

So what kinda wine did you get?


(Rebecca sighs)
Come on, it's your favorite.

Yes.
All right, you ready?

Um, am I gonna hate it?

Probably, yeah.

Okay.
All right.

(gentle suspenseful music)

I already hate it.
Oh, come on.

Give it a chance.

I will, I will, I'm sorry.

Next time I pick a movie.

horror movies are classic.

Do you remember one
time when we were small,

we were out here?

It was from right over there.

I jumped out at you from behind the tree

and grandpa got all excited

and he shook his fist at me and he said,

"Boy, you'll be damned to hell." (laughs)

Remember that? Right over there.

Well, you used to really be scared here.

Johnny.

Oh, you're still afraid.

Stop it now, I mean it.

They're coming to get you, Barbara.


coming for you, Barbara.

you're acting like a child.

What an asshole.
They're coming for you.

(Rebecca gasps)
Look, there comes

one of them now.

He'll hear you!
I hope this movie

gets better.
It will.

I'm getting out of here.
Johnny!

I'm relatively sure it does.
(Rebecca chuckles)

(gentle suspenseful music)

Help!
Boom!

Jesus.
Johnny,

help me! (Rebecca chuckles)

(suspenseful music)

(wall thudding)
(Johnny grunting)

(suspenseful music)

John,

what's that noise?

It must be the pipe.

Fuck, that's ridiculous.

Well, look, the pipes
are right below us,

right, you're gonna hear it.

Are you sure?

Yes.

Calm down.

Calm down, you calm down. Fuck.

(suspenseful music)

(Rebecca exhales sharply)

(suspenseful music)
(footsteps plodding)

(suspenseful music)

Remind me why we do this to ourselves.

still just a little creeped out

from the grounds keeper guy today.


(Rebecca exhales sharply)

Finally a reasonable
choice from this chick.

she ain't that useless.


(Barbara screams)


you'd be cuddles up to me,
clenching my arm right now.

(laughs) Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.

have your hand on my knee.




you'd give me a foot rub.

(laughs) What?
(Rebecca laughs)

A foot rub, is that what I would do?

Yeah, what were you thinking?

I was thinking about something else.

John! (laughs)

Okay, here we go.

I knew it was coming, but now it's on.

Oh, it's been on for a minute.

(Rebecca laughs)

(suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music continues)

(John sighs)

It's nice to get out of LA, huh?

So nice.

It's crazy how you can
see the stars out here.

Yeah.
Mm.

The town is so cute too.

Mm-hmm.

But it's so crazy how like the stores

are only open like a couple days a week

at really weird times.

Yeah, it's a family town.

Get a lot of people come
up here and raise families.

Raise kids.

Huh?

Yeah.

Hey, remember we gotta get
the stuff out of the car.

Uh,

yeah, we should do that.

Okay.

Want some first?
Mm.

(sighs) Okay.
Okay.

(floorboards creaking)

(footsteps plodding)

(door squeaks)

(zip zipping)

I'm gonna brush my teeth really quick.

Okay, I'm gonna change first.

Okay. (Rebecca groans)

(Rebecca yawns)

Ah.

(John yawns)

(John groans)

(water sloshing)

(gentle suspenseful music)

(Rebecca exhales sharply)

No.

(exhales sharply) One,

two.

(Rebecca groans)

Ah.

(water sloshing)

Mm, mm-mm.

Move over.

So?
(laughs) Maybe.

Ah, I'll take a maybe.
(Rebecca laughs)

Okay, I know you will.

Hey, what time is it?

It's like 11:30.
Mm.

(urine spattering)

You better put that lid down
before you flush that toilet.


You know how many germs fly
up when you flush a toilet?


I mean, yeah, it's gross.

Like, what do you wanna do,

brush your teeth with a poop toothbrush?

(John laughs) I don't think so.

Oh my gosh, is this like
some, uh, some fetish thing

we should talk about?
Just-

Okay, okay, look, I'll flush
the toilet now and forever.

Thank you.

Do you wanna go on
a hike in the morning?

Do I look like I wanna go
on a hike in the morning?


Mm, and you guessed right.

You either get sex or a hike?

Pick one.
Ah. (whistles)

Which one do you think I'm gonna choose?


(toothbrush buzzing)

(water sloshing)

(ring clinks)

(dramatic suspenseful music)
(clock ticking)

(dramatic suspenseful music continues)

(clock ticking)

(clock ticking continues)

(birds chirping)

(exhales sharply) Okay.

(Rebecca breathes heavily)

Mm.

(birds chirping)


Good morning.
Mm.

Wake up, Johnny Boy.

Wake up.

Mm.
Want me to make

you some coffee?

Yeah.
Yeah?

Yeah, that'd be great.
Okay.

Mm.

(John yawns)

Oh, or you can come back in bed.

(birds chirping)

(coffee rustles)

(gentle suspenseful music)

(John yawns)

(John exhales sharply)

(birds chirping)

(John sniffs)


I'll join you in a minute.

(coffee burbling)

(glass clinking)

(door clicks) (door squeaks)

John, did you leave this
door unlocked last night?

Ah, shit, um, yeah, I might've.


After that creepy guy
scared the shit out of us,

you're gonna leave this door unlocked?

Like, I just came out to have a smoke.

Okay, we're fine, it's
not that big a deal.

I get it.

(door clicks) (door squeaks)

Ugh, unbelievable.

Why, thank you.

Oh, wasn't a compliment.

(John sighs)

(coffee sloshing)

Um.

Thank you.
Yep.

(mug clanks)
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

How about I make us some breakfast?

You hungry?

Yes, please.


Uh, two.

(fridge door thuds)

Aw. (chuckles)

Wow, so cute.

What?

Come look at this.

(Rebecca chuckles)

They're available for fostering.

(John exhales sharply)
Just saying.

Well, I'm just saying
that'll be really nice

for whoever fosters them, anybody but us.

But, hey, since we're on the subject,

I could do a baby instead.

We haven't even started
planning our wedding yet.

Right, have you set a date for that?

about to have this conversation

right now on our vacation, so.


I'll just go back to making breakfast.

(bacon packet rustling)

(bacon sizzling)

Mm, delicious, baby, thank you.

You're welcome.

Hey, so I know you said
you didn't want to earlier,

but it's nice outside, - Mm.

I would love to go for a hike

or a walk around the neighborhood.

And?

And you're invited
if you'd like to join.

Um.

I don't know, I, uh-

Don't worry about it.

I'm probably just gonna
go after breakfast.

No, yeah, I just, I
love that for you, baby,

I just don't really feel like it, so.

No pressure.

But I think I'm gonna
go and take my mat out,

do some yoga on the deck.

(exhales sharply) That's great.

I won't try to convince you.


Couldn't even make it through breakfast.

No, I just have to send
a quick email, I forgot.

I'm just messing with you.

What? Are you mad?

No, no.

I better go get ready though.

Okay.

(dishes clattering)

(birds chirping)
(footsteps plodding)

(birds chirping)

Okay.

All done.

Should be good for the rest of the day.

That's great.

(Rebecca sighs)

You gonna be like this all day?

I'm not being like anything.

I just wanna get outside, go for a hike,

get out in some nature.

Why did you move my toothbrush?

I didn't.

John, it's okay, if you
knocked it over or something,

just tell me.

Rebecca, I didn't touch your toothbrush.

I only do when it's to
put it on the charger.

John, I know what I did
with my toothbrush last night.

I finished brushing my teeth
and I put it right there

next to the soap.

(water sloshing)

Well,

um, yeah, I don't know what to tell you.

Well, I know I didn't move it so,

had to have been you, but whatever.

Bullshit.

(birds chirping)

(Rebecca breathes heavily)

(suspenseful music)

What?

What the fuck?

John?

(suspenseful music continues)

(suspenseful music continues)
(insects chirping)

(suspenseful music continues)

(suspenseful music continues)

(suspenseful music continues)

(dramatic suspenseful music)

(knocking on door)
(Rebecca gasps)

(Rebecca exhales sharply)

Dammit!

(Rebecca exhales sharply)

Who is it?

Oh, just a neighbor.

I said, who is it?

Oh, I just live down the street.

How did you get into the gate?

Oh, I'm an old friend of the owner.

He gave me an extra remote
in case for emergencies.

(Rebecca exhales sharply)


Hi.
Hi, how can I help you?

I sincerely apologize
for disturbing you,

but my little Piglet got out last night.

(gentle suspenseful music)
(birds chirping)

Your cat's name is Piglet?

Yes, ma'am.

Okay, well, I haven't seen him.

That's strange, I, I swear
I saw him come this way.

And this is the only house that...

You know, it's okay, ma'am, if
you could just do me a favor?

If you happen to see him running around,

do you mind just calling that number

on the back of the picture?

Uh, we just live a ways down the road

and, well, there aren't
that many neighbors.

Are you sure he is not in here?

I know what I saw.

And if you could just let me come in

and take a quick look.
No, it's okay,

I have your number, right,
so I'll just give you a call.

I'd rather you not come in the house, so.

Are you hiding my Piglet?

What?
Are you hiding my baby?

No!
I know he's in here.

Okay, I know what I saw.

Please just let me come in,

just for a second, please.
Okay, you're crazy.

(knocking on door)

Let me in!
What the?

Let me in. (suspenseful music)

Geez.

(suspenseful music continues)

(Rebecca exhales sharply)

(Rebecca grunts)

(Rebecca sighs)

(Rebecca exhales sharply)

Fuck it.

(birds chirping)

(birds continue chirping)

(birds continue chirping)

(gentle suspenseful music)

Still got it.

(cork pops) Whoo!

(suspenseful music)

(insects chirping)

(lotion can hissing)

(suspenseful music continues)

(Rebecca exhales sharply)

(suspenseful music continues)
(wind whooshing)

(dramatic suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music continues)

(suspenseful music continues)

(suspenseful music continues)

(Rebecca exhales sharply)

Hi.

Did you get a little sleepy out here?

Mm-hmm, yeah.

And I feel like I was dreaming about you

'cause now here you are.

(Rebecca laughs)
(chuckles) Here I am.

Got back as soon as I could.

Aw, thanks, baby.

Yeah.
I love you.

I love you too.

I'm gonna go shower real
quick, I'm all sweaty.

Yeah, I know, I got sweaty too.

Shower sounds nice.

But I like it when you're sweaty.

Aw, gross. (laughs)

Why don't you go start the shower

and I'll be up to give you a surprise?

Okay.
Okay.

(Rebecca chuckles)

(Rebecca breathes heavily)

Mm.

Ooh, why, hello there.
(insects chirping)

(birds chirping)


Mm.

(water pattering)

(door clicks)

(door thuds)

(water continues pattering)

(gentle suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music continues)

I miss you.


Where are you?

â™ª The wind it blows â™ª
What's wrong?

â™ª Blows me through â™ª

â™ª Your hands â™ª
You're distant.


â™ª It's gold â™ª
You tell me.

(gentle indie music)

â™ª The sun cast your shadow long â™ª

â™ª I see in you â™ª

â™ª Something time will turn â™ª

â™ª Into gold â™ª

â™ª Even though â™ª

â™ª I know â™ª

â™ª Still to me â™ª

â™ª You're gold â™ª

(suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music continues)

You still got it.

Hmm, you still got it too, Mr. Taylor.

Now get out.

I have to pee. (laughs)
Oh, all right.

(gentle suspenseful music)

So,

So?
What do you wanna do

the rest of the day?

Um, like beyond sitting on
the couch and drinking all day?


Mm, I don't know, what
were you thinking about?

I don't know, I mean,
we can go into town.

We can go to the lake.
Mm-hmm.

Both sound fun.

Um,

honestly, nothing sounds better

than just lounging in
our underwear all day.

(both laugh)

All right, can't argue with that one.

Okay.
(gentle suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music)



you know I can't go anywhere
without them. (laughs)

I've been wearing these
UGGs since you met me, boy.

I know.
Better know.

(gentle suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music continues)

(suspenseful music continues)


Yes, ma'am. (Rebecca sighs)

perfect martini.

Hey, this martini is
a special $20 martini

with blue cheese stuffed olives.

Yeah.
Wow, that's a pretty

high price tag to live up to, baby.

But I'm rooting for it.
Hey, these olives

are stocked with the finest blue cheese

that money can buy.
Ah.

It's a masterpiece.
(laughs) Cheers.


Mm.
(whistles) Huh?

Wow.

I mean, that's a fucking
pretty good martini.

Yes, it is.
I don't know

if it's worth $20, (John laughs)

but it's pretty fucking good.
Okay.

(Rebecca laughs) I'll take that.

Mm.

Everything just tastes
better up here, huh?

Yeah.
Hm.

Hey.

I mean, we could just move here.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

What, in like 10 years?

Settle down, start a family.

Yeah, that's an idea. (laughs)

No,

I'm being serious.

Baby,

you know

I can't leave LA 'cause of work,

I mean, plus our whole lives are there.

What would we do, just abandon everything?

I'm just saying,

think about it?
(suspenseful music)

Let's play a game.

(Rebecca chuckles)

A game?
Yeah.

(suspenseful music)

Um.
What game do you wanna play?


You wanna play poker?
I'm good at poker.

the cards? Poker chips?

I mean, like, it's not
gonna be that much fun

without any poker chips.

(suspenseful music)
No, I wouldn't

say that, John.

(Rebecca screams)
Hey, hey!

(gun clicks) Whoa, hey, man,

who the fuck are you?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

I wouldn't do that if I was you.

huh, what the fuck do you want?

Is this how you treat a guest?

Hey.

May I sit?
Hey, man,

hey, whatever this is, man,

it ain't fucking funny, all right?

It isn't funny at all, what would be?

John.

John.

Hey, man.

Hey, look, we'll give you
whatever you want, man,

all right, please just, just
stop pointing the gun at her.

Do you see that, Rebecca?

This is John way try to take
some sort of control back

in this situation.

You have lost control, John.

Okay, all right, hey,

hey, what can I do, huh?

Huh, what can I do?

I'll tell you what you can do.

How about you fill that shaker with ice

and grab everything you need

in order to make one of those
perfect martinis of yours?

Now?
Yes, John, now.

If it takes more than a
minute, I shoot your wife.

Chop, chop. (suspenseful music)

Don't do anything stupid,

I can see her forehead
from here perfectly.


It's okay, sweetheart.

(ice rattling)

Hurry up, John,

the clock is ticking.

Here we go, John.

Thank you kindly.

Have a seat.

Whoa, this is a perfect martini, John.

It's like a confection for bartender.

Why you don't drink?

Sweethearts, come on, have a sip.

You're a sick man.
(suspenseful music)

Do I look like sick for you?

Do I look like sick for you?

I mean, John, do I look like sick for you?

'Cause I feel so healthy right now.

(Rebecca gasps)
Fuck!

Damn, eh, fuck, I just wanna
play our little game, man.

I need you to put these on, guys.

(handcuffs clank)

Come on, John, have a seat over there.

I said now, John, - All right.

Have a seat over there.
All right, all right,

okay, okay, all right.

(Rebecca breathing heavily)
Chop chop, sweetheart.

Have a seat there.

I want your left hand, her right hand.

Hey, you never told us your name.

My name is what? My name is who?

What's your name? Hey!
(Rebecca crying)

Hey, are you okay?

Hey, okay, okay, all right, all right.

Put them on.
(handcuffs rattling)

Could you squeeze them a little bit more?

You know, there is something
so satisfy about that sound.

(handcuffs creaking)
(Rebecca breathing shakily)

Like this. (suspenseful music)

(chair rattles)

There you go, John.

What now?

That's the question, John.

We could watch a movie, how about that?

I'm not sure, did you guys ever finish

"The Night of the Living Dead?"

Or, or maybe you can lead
us through some yoga.

That would be nice, Becky.


No, John, it isn't okay at all.

But it will be, I promise you.

(breathing heavily) Why,
why are you doing this, huh?

(exhales sharply) I've
been playing this game

since I was

16 years old.

My father passed it on to me,

and I must play one per year,

every year until I lose or I die.

It is what it is.

This is the way it has to be.

But why us?

Why do you have to do this to us?

We don't deserve this.

Why not you?

Why not you?

I mean, what makes you more
special than any other couples

in any other cabin in this little town?

Why you?

Well, I'm afraid just the luck of my draw.

I'm curious though,

would you ever replace yourself
with an innocent couple?

(suspenseful music)

Interesting.

I'm always so intrigued at this
moment between any couples.

Okay.

Okay, what happens now, huh?

Straight to the point, I
like that about you, John.

But, you know, maybe
sometimes Becky will love

a little bit more of foreplay.

You son of a bitch.

John, all right, John,

I think it's time to play our game, right?

(suspenseful music)

Now,

I assume you both are
familiar with the game of War.

Good. (suspenseful music)

This is my beauty,

my extremely reliable beauty.

I'm gonna place a bullet

in one of the chamber.

(suspenseful music)

We play by the rules of War,

then the loser,

they're gonna play their own
game of Russian roulette.

We play until there only two of us left,

and I'm gonna be

in every bit as much as you are.

Exciting, right?

Who goes first?

Meeny, miny,

moe,

let's put our fate in Rebecca hands.

Would you like to draw it first?

No.

What you mean no?

I'm not gonna take part
in your sick little game,

if you wanna see someone dead,

you can pick up that gun
and take your own life.

This isn't on us.

This is you being a psycho,
okay, we didn't do anything.

(suspenseful music)

Becky,

the rules are simple.

If you refuse to play,
that's called forfeit.

So

Any card that we draw
will be higher than yours.

So if you keep this route,
this game will be fairly quick.

(John exhales sharply)

The choice is yours, baby.

God, John.

Goddammit.
John, what do we do?

Draw a card, Rebecca.

Bravo, John, bravo.
(suspenseful music)


(Rebecca breathing heavily)

(exhales sharply) Oh, Jesus.
I mean,

there is plenty below her.

Action on you, John, you now.

(suspenseful music)


Okay.

Oh, okay.

So,

lucky number seven.

Yes!

I'm not so lucky today, huh, John?

Go ahead.

Ah! (screams)
(Rebecca shrieks)

(John breathing heavily)

Told you this was exciting.

Ooh!

Fuck.

(John and Rebecca breathing heavily)

How many times have you done this?

Are you sure you want to know that?

17 people, they come and
go the touch of this gun

since it came into my life.

Yes, John, now you know.

Jesus.

Well, I'm not a believer,

but if the Bible is true,

I'm sure it's on your side.

(John breathing heavily)

(gun tapping)
(suspenseful music)

(Rebecca groans)

You're not dead yet,
John, you're not dead yet.

(suspenseful music continues)

How they say, winner, winner,

chicken dinner, right?
Oh, fuck.

Goddammit. (Rebecca groans)

(Rebecca breathing heavily)

It's okay, it's okay,
baby, it's okay, it's okay.


John. (crying)
It's okay.

Hey, I'll take this one.

I'll take.
Don't you fucking

touch the gun or I'm gonna shoot her.

If you don't play - Okay.

Okay, okay.
By the rules, I both shoot.

Okay, okay, I fucking get it.

I get it, okay?
Don't do it again, John.

Don't do it again.

I'll play by the rules.

Ah, fuck!

(Rebecca groans)

Listen, (breathing heavily)

it's okay, its okay.
(Rebecca crying)

Now, you bring up an
interesting carrier.

Rebecca can take this gun,

she can put it to her head.

Or she can choose to turn the gun on you.

No, no, I could never.
(John breathes heavily)

No.
No, but you have to.

What?
Honey, you have to,

look, I couldn't live
with myself without you.

(Rebecca and John breathing heavily)

All right, all right, you
have to do this, all right?

You have to do this for us.

Okay?

Okay?
No, no, no, no, no.

Please, please, sir, please,
I'm sorry for everything,

but please just d-don't
make me do this, okay?


I will kill you.

And don't do anything stupid.

It's your choice.

(Rebecca breathes heavily)

Hey, hey, baby,

just grab the gun, okay,

one step at a time, okay?

Okay?

Come on, you got it.

(dramatic suspenseful music)
Come on, there you go.

There you go, baby, there
you go, there you go.

(Rebecca crying)

But, John, (breathing heavily)

What if the bullet is in
the chamber when I shoot?

(suspenseful music)

Honey, I'm not kidding, it has to be me.

No.
All right, it has,

you have to pull the trigger on me,

honey.
No.

Look, I know this isn't fair
of me to ask for you, honey,

but I need you to do this, okay?

John,

I can't hurt you.

Oh, no, you're not hurting me.

All right, you're giving me what I want,

you're giving me a chance to see you live.

(Rebecca breathes heavily)
All right, whatever happens,

it's okay, it's okay.

Okay?

Okay, we've had a beautiful life together.

Huh? Right?
Mm.

(John breathes heavily)
We have, we have.

Yeah. Yeah.
We have.

(suspenseful music)

It's okay, it's okay.
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

All right, (breathes
heavily) you have do this.

You have to do this.


Okay, okay.

Just grab the gun, baby.
(breathes heavily) No.

Grab the gun, baby.
No.

Grab the gun, baby.
No.

All right.

(both breathing heavily)

This is how it ends.
(suspenseful music)

(both breathing heavily)

It was gonna end one
way or another, right?

(Rebecca crying)

I love you, Rebecca.

I love you so much.

So much.
I love you, baby,

I love you.

I've always loved you.

Pull the trigger.
(Rebecca crying)

Pull the trigger.

(Rebecca screams) (gun fires)

(body thuds) (Rebecca sobbing)


(Rebecca sobbing)

No! You son of a-(gun fires)

(suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music continues)
