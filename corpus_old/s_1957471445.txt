Can you make your brother
some breakfast, please?

He ate.
When?

Before you were awake.

You have a class?

You were supposed to be

Now, see, that's some bullshit.

All right, come on. I want you to move away.

I'll get him.

All right, everybody
stay away from the fence.

You need to go talk to them.

Them who?

Uh, the assholes
who hotwired your fence.

You don't know who lives there?

The seller said they were quiet.
They never met him before.

Yeah, they're obviously
fucking crazy.

Don't worry, he'll be back.
He'll fly back in.

Look at me.

Sweetie, you'll see.
He'll be back.

All right, come on.

He'll be back. Come on.

What you see coming in?
Nothing strange.

I spent half the trip
trying to stay out of the way

of people who were driving
like maniacs.

And the other half of the trip
wondering why these fools

acting like it's their first
time ever hearing bad news.

I'm scared.

How are we gonna get
what we need?

Babe.

People overreact.

They did the same thing
when COVID hit.

I got a text, what, 20 times

that the president
was gonna declare martial law

and the country was gonna go
into lockdown.

And the country
went into lockdown.

The country went to "Stay home."

Well, since we all gonna
be stuck at home,

maybe you can get our neighbor
to cut off his fence.

neighbor for ten or 15 miles.

You might want to know
who they are.

Huh. Well, who's your neighbor?

BROOKE: Oh,
there's a lot of people

live next door to me, Mr. Shade.
I thought we were friends.

GREG: Hmm.

Look, I will drive up the road
to see if I can find

the entrance to the property.

Entrance? How big is the place?

I don't know.

Stay off my bed.

I don't want to be on your bed.

Just thinking about
what goes on there. Ugh.

Nothing goes on there.

Which is why you want me
to stay off of it.

BROOKE: Nothing goes on there?

Is that your business?
It's not my business.

I don't want it to be.

You got your man back.
That's the win.

I thought I was done.

Hmm. Sex.

I wish.

He doesn't want it?

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

He tries.
Oh. He's here, Helen.

It was an affair,
not the Titanic.

If you want your man,
you better act like it.

Why is it on me?

You want to be happy,
so get happy.

You want to trade?

I want the man I married.
I want my husband.

No, you want a time machine.

You set these impossible
expectations

that no one can keep,
including yourself.

When it comes time for you
to do one little thing...

It's not little.
Well, then I'm happy for you.

'Cause size matters.
You better use it or lose it.

(BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY)

I hate you.
You love me.

You just don't know
how to show it.

(LAUGHS)
Did you talk to him?

All I saw was a rundown stable
and an old trailer.

There's nobody there.
BROOKE: They just issued a curfew.

Yeah, I should probably go.

HELEN: No, stay.

I mean, you've been drinking.
I've been sipping and it's fine.

It's only 30 minutes away.

I'll be at my house

Maybe. Maybe not.

I mean, if you think about it,
it's weird

how long a bird survives

Is that what
you're gonna tell Kai?

His bird is better off

I don't know

What is it?
Well,

it looks like

What do you mean worse?

Well, it might be a sign
of placental abruption.

Might.

Might not.

Well, is that how you want

Next time, you come alone.

That's not your decision.

She can either come alone
or leave alone.

Matty.

Follow me.

Sub chorionic hematoma?

"These blood clots
are rarely problematic."

"They usually result
in a onetime bleed

once the clot has passed."

The bleeding stopped.

You think I'm stupid?
I don't.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

You lied to me.
I was being cautious.

The only reason you're here

Go.

I'll check on Zoe.

rest. She's still bleeding.

Is the baby in trouble?

Could be.

Something is aggravating
her condition.

What has she been doing?
Nothing out of the ordinary.

Besides living in a bunker.

AMBER: Let her stay, Winter.

Please? Just...

Okay, just... just
give me a second.

All right, hon?

With third trimester bleeding,

the chances of her having
a complicated delivery

are significantly higher.

You know, we could be dealing
with placenta previa,

placental abruption,
incompetent cervix.

There's really no way to know,
given the lack of prenatal care.

I've been taking care
of this family for years.

Yeah, well, this baby is coming.
She going to need help.

You're going to need help.

I'm not gonna need help
from all of you.

But you can't get it without us.

I don't think you know
what's been going on out there.

Why do you think I'm in here?

No, it's okay.
It's fine.

Why?

'Cause that's what we do.

So, how come I never
seen you around before?

Like at school and stuff?

Uh, the school system is, um...

Uh, my dad doesn't
believe in it.

So, you're homeschooled?

(LAUGHS SOFTLY) I guess
you could call it that.


What's wrong with your brother?

Nothing.

I mean,
he's actually really smart.

He's adopted.

We know his birth mother died

but... other than that,

we don't know

He just doesn't talk.

They said it's like
a coping mechanism.

Yeah, well,

You all being here one month
uses up six months of supplies!

You don't know that.

You can't just take from us.

Everybody's got to bring
something to the table!

All right, do me a favor, okay?

When you talk about me,
talk to me.

(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYS)

WINTER: Dear Lord,
please bless this food

we are about to receive.

Watch over Amber

as she prepares to bring
a precious life into this world.

Pray for my guests.

Bless their Kai...

so that he may be
one day healed and...

and speak your good word.

In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

Amen.
Amen.

Amen.
AMBER: Amen.

(PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYS)

Why didn't you say "Amen"?

That's kind of a... personal
question, don't you think?

I like to know what kind of
man's sitting at my table.

Amen to that.

There's nothing wrong with Kai.

What's that?

ZOE: You said bless Kai
so he can speak.

He can speak. He just doesn't.
Zoe.

I'm just saying
what you told me to say

when people treat Kai like
he's different. He's not.

He's fine.

Amen to that.

GREG: Hmm.

We spoke to Kai
about touching your things.

And that won't happen again.

Appreciate that.


(GUN RACKS)

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

WINTER: You, uh...
you want to pour.

You got to let it sit.
Wipe it off.

And drop 'em in.

Think you can handle that?

Pour, let it sit,
wipe it off and drop it in?

I think so.
Yeah, okay.


WINTER: And pour.

You got to let it sit
for a second.

Wipe it off.

There you go.

Okay. You keep doing this.

(GUNSHOT ECHOING)


That's fine.

(GREG GROANS)
Man should know how to shoot.

Uh, mm-mm. "A rifle these hands
will never fire."

"History will look upon the Act

depriving a whole nation
of arms as the blackest."

Ah. You know your Gandhi.

That quote is out of context.
He wasn't arguing for more guns.

He was arguing for the repeal
of the Arms Act of 1878.

Well, it would've been
a more convincing argument

if he had a gun.

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYS)

GREG: Where'd you study?
(GUNSHOT)

Library mostly.
Iraq, Afghanistan.


Hmm.

W.E.B. Du Bois believed that
without a proper education,

anything that the Black man
was working to get

could be taken away from him.

Booker T. Washington
believed a man

should not use
an education to avoid labor.

He was Black, too, right?

Yes, he was.

Well, I believe it's best
to have an education

than to need one.

How do you expect
to protect your family?

There are other ways.

Not here.

Go ahead.

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYS)



I guess,
I guess you were right.


You just got...
Yeah, you got to cock it.


Oh, my gosh, he ordered
the same thing every time.

It was eggs over hard
with extra bacon.

And mind you, this is at
three o'clock in the morning.

He never said
more than two words to me,

until one night,
I left my lights on

and he jumpstarted my car.

Next time he came in,
I offered to comp his meal,

but no, no, no,
he wanted the bill.

back to his empty table,

I thought, "He must've left me
his number."

But you know what he wrote
on the receipt?

"You left your
lights on again."

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
AMBER: I know.

What's that fabric?

Oh, that's...
Winter got that overseas.

He calls it a, um...

a du... something.

Dupatta.
AMBER: Dupatta.

That's right.
Yes, dupatta. You're right.

(AMBER CHUCKLES)
Excellent.

Whoo. It's beautiful.

It's nice.
Mm.

You don't like it?

He thinks I don't know,
but he...

It was for his wife.

Then he gave it to me and it
still had the card inside,

so I just didn't feel right
wearing it.

Looks really pretty on you.

Here, take it.

Wait, you're taking your son

Uh-uh. I'm taking you.
Go get dressed.

Not what they're about to get.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS)

This is not a negotiation.

You're either an asset

I'm not a liability.

So, I'm screaming and crying

there with me, holding my hand.

He's really, he's such
a sweet boy.

HELEN: He is.
You did a great job.

WINTER: Now, listen.

I want to call him Daniel.

(MUSIC PLAYING QUIETLY

That's a good name.

AMBER: It is.
Virtue. Integrity.

A man of God.
Hmm.

Here's to blessings.
Mm.

Amen.

Amen.

I can't. I'm still nursing.

Ah. Yeah.

What's wrong?

Greg told me he killed a man.
He did what needed to be done.


The first time you take a life,
it haunts you.

Second time, it thrills you,
you know?

Eventually, it just numbs you.

Maybe it's like
delivering babies.

You do it enough, it gets old.

Bringing life into the world...

that never gets old.

I delivered a baby once.

Afghanistan.
We're in this canyon

taking fire from a bunch
of 12-year-olds. Right?

And I see this little
mud brick house, okay?

So, I shimmy over to it,
you know, take cover.

And inside there's this girl,
scared to death,

with a baby's head
halfway out of her.

(GENTLE MUSIC PLAYS)

So, I go over to her.

And she's pushing,
and out pops this baby,

a little boy,
right into my hands.

And I knew right then
that I needed to get home.

But you come back,
it's like...

It's like I was frozen in time
but my life kept moving.

And I found out my wife slept
with somebody, you know.

She left you?
I left her.

But, you know, this guy,
he was no good for her.

I knew that, but I wasn't there.

And she had...
she had this laugh.

Had pretty red hair.
Auburn, she liked to call it.

I loved her.

I really did.

I'm sorry.

Your husband...
he's got a spirit in him.

It's only so long
before it comes out again,

and when it does,
I don't want it coming at me.

That's not gonna end well.

I think you and your family
need to figure out

what you're gonna do.

Winter...
I'll give you a week.

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS)

(DOOR OPENING)

(DOOR CLOSING)

When?
A week.

to prove our value.

What, killing a man
is not enough?

You did what needed to be done.

When did he tell you that?

Another one of your
breakout sessions?

Greg, don't you question me.

You have no right to question me.
I'm asking you.

Okay? I'm asking you.
You're my wife.

Yeah. (SCOFFS) Don't I know it.

Helen, I'm trying to understand
what's happening here.

All right, let me recap for you.

Winter wants to throw us out,

and you're worried about me
talking to him,

instead of trying to figure
out what we gonna do.

Okay, so now it's okay
for me to try.


So, what do you want?

to not have to ask me that.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

MATTY: Can I ask you something?

Sure.

How old were you when you had
your first girlfriend?

I was about your age.

Um...
maybe a little bit younger.

I wasn't the macho type,
but I could talk.

Girls like that.
The girls I knew anyway.

I'm not much of a talker.

Is it Zo?

No. No, no, she, uh...

No, you don't even
have to explain.

I mean, is this the first time
you've been around a girl?

Let me ask you a question.

Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

How long... you guys been here?
Like, you know, in the bunker?

Not too long. Couple months.

We were living in the trailer
up front.

Oh.
I liked it a lot better.

Then my... my dad
started hearing about

all this stuff on the news
about everything,

and, uh, he said
we needed to get ready.

Need to get back to work.

AMBER: (CRYING)
<i>No, this is so hard.</i>

This is so hard.
HELEN: No, no, but you can do it. You can do it.

Now, take your right hand
and get your breast.

His nose a little tickle
with the nipple.


HELEN: You know,
he's ready to latch.

He's ready to latch, so get
his head right on the tip.

Oh. Ow, God, that hurts!
Get him off!

Get him off, please!
Get him off, get him off!

Come on, Amber!
You got to try, Amber!

Just try! The boy needs to eat.

No, no, no, no, no. Okay...
WINTER: You got to try. The boy's...

Listen, unlatch him
or you're gonna do more damage.

Helen, I can't do this. I can't
do this. You make it look...

WINTER: Watch your tone, Amber.

(VOICES CONTINUE IN DISTANCE)

(AMBER CRYING IN DISTANCE)

Come on.

All right. There you go.

Let's try now. Lift his mouth

you were supposed to...

(SHUSHES LOUDLY)

Is it normal
for it to hurt this bad?

No, this... this...

Ow! No, this...
it cannot be normal

for it to hurt this bad. It cannot be normal...
Just relax.

Her nipples are a bloody mess.

Mm-hmm. Yeah, this may be
a more complicated issue.

Her nipples could be inverted.
Daniel could be tongue-tied.

WINTER: What do...
what do you mean?

HELEN: Daniel's losing weight.

I mean, we've got to start
thinking about formula.

You did think to stock up
on formula?

I mean, after all,
you bought popcorn.

Breastfeeding was supposed
to be healthy and free.

And you're okay with that?

I'm not gonna let her

Um. Nothing to worry about.

Come on, Dad,

Don't do to me

No, everything is not okay.

I'm not stupid.
What are you talking about?

You think I don't know what's going on?
Okay, what's going on?

I know about you
and that woman.

That's between me and your mom.
It's not just between you and her. It's not.

She's feeding that man's baby
right now.

And all she's saying
is trust her,

but you're not even saying anything.
Zo, listen, I'm your father.

Okay?
And this is your fault.

The fucking world is collapsing.
That's not my fault.

Look, I know you're scared.


Your mother and I are trying
to figure this thing out.

It don't look like it.

You can't let him do this
to our family.

You just can't.


I think I'm ready to try again.

Are you sure?

HELEN: It can take a few weeks
for you to heal,

and the last thing
you want to do

is... hurt yourself even more.

Well, she said
she wanted to try.

GREG: You ought to...

You ought to watch
where you put your hands.

Hey. You need to eat that.

We don't let food go to waste
around here.

We eat what we make.

I'm not hungry.
Won't keep.

There's a lot going on.
She just needs a little rest.

please fix me a bowl?

to eat your dinner.
