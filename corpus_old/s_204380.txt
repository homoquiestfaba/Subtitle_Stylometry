1099 A.D. It was an age
of religious Crusades and Holy Wars.

After a grueling
four-year campaign...

the Knights of Christendom finally
arrived at the gates of Jerusalem.

During the furious battle
for the Holy City...

a Flemish Knight,
Charles Le Vaillant...

had a life-changing epiphany.

Le Vaillant was struck
by the hypocrisy of killing...

fellow human beings
in the name of religion...

especially since these people
professed belief in the same god.

The Fazar,
Le Vaillant's written account...

of his experiences
in the Holy Land...

tells us he wandered the streets
of conquered Jerusalem...

for days after that bloody battle...

until he found the entrance
of a cave...

that ran beneath the length
of the Holy City.

Inside that cave, he began
to record his epiphany...

which became the basis
for a new religious sect...

an order that would combine
the fundamental tenets...

of the three major religious
of his day.

His first converts were
fellow Christian knights...

who'd also become disenchanted
by the bloodshed.

The force of his convictions
even won over...

a number of Muslims and Jews,
former enemies...

who now became willing converts
to the new faith.

Many years after completing
the original Fazar...

Le Vaillant had further revelations.

He wrote these down, intending them
to be added as the final chapter.

Around the same time,
he and his followers...

were being accused of heresy
by the Crusader authorities.

On their way to Syria,
he and a group of disciples...

were intercepted by some
of the very same Crusaders...

he had once commanded.

During the battle that followed...

Le Vaillant died a martyr's death.

The final chapter he had written
was lost.

Do you have the alarm code?
And no guards, right?

You will be like the fox
in the hen house.

Take as many eggs as you like.

Yuri, it's Russian mob.
No mistakes on this one, right?

My friend, this is 1,000 percent.

By this time tomorrow, you'll be
in New York making the deal.

A sale. And I'll be in Tel Aviv
waiting for my commission.

Visual is all clear.

Come on.
Done.

Way to go, Yuri. I'm in.

Do you see the egg?

It's beautiful.

Yes! Yes!

I'm going for it.

I got it.
Yuri's the man with the plan!

You're the man with the plan.
I told you.

Shit.
Rudy.

Are you okay?

Was that a gunshot?
No. I farted.

Guide me out of here.

Oh, shit. Rudy, I'm sorry.

Toilet.

Hey, pal, this is a taxi zone.
You want to get towed away?

Sorry. Watch it for me.

Thanks.
Right on.

Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps you've
seen enough stones and carvings.

All right, come with me.
I will now show you a garment.

One of our most controversial
acquisitions.

This was unearthed beneath
a false storage room...

situated by Theodosius
as a decoy against thieves.

Quite often, success
as an archaeologist...

depends on knowing where to dig.

Well, I can dig her.

Rudy! Would you
take over for me, please?

Can I have your...
Okay, everybody, follow me.

Dad, what's up? My main man!

Why must you always
attract attention?

Come on. I love people.
I love life.

You love to embarrass me.

I'm just having fun, Dad.

Anyway, you called me.
Want to talk?

Yes, but not here. Come on.

So tell me, Rudy, are you still
involved with that same nonsense?

Hey, I'm legit now.
Straight, import/ export.

And I'm kicking ass.
Now, check this out.

Here, take it. For you.

Fancy watches,
fast cars, easy money.

What does it all really prove
in the grand scheme of things?

Yeah?
You have the egg?

Yeah, I've got it. Trust me,
it's in pristine condition.

10:00.
Yeah, I'll be there.

Later. Tonight. Some business.

I do hope, for your sake,
it is legal.

A thousand percent.
Come on.

Damn plane tickets.
They are here somewhere.

Where are you going?
Another dig?

No. An interview with someone
I've been trying to meet...

for a very long time.

Don't touch that!
Sorry.

What is it?

The lost chapter of the Fazar.

Oh.

The Fazar happens to be
the holy scripture...

for an obscure Middle Eastern sect.

And yes, to answer your
inevitable next question...

it is quite valuable.

But only to practicing members
of the Order.

What can I say, Dad?
You have an exciting life.

Rudy, we need to discuss
some important issues.

Can you come by my apartment
this evening?

I've got some business tonight.

In fact, it's time to go, Dad.

All right.
Can you at least call me?

Of course.

Absolutely.

Tonight.
Rudy, it has to be tonight.

You've got it, Dad.

Be careful.

What's going on?
What's up?

Mr. Cafmeyer, this way, please.

So, let's see
what Santa brought for me.

This egg was designed
by Peter Carl Faberge.

A special gift to Czar Nikolay.

Look at that inlay...
2 4-carat gold.

What can I say?
One of a kind.

That's why it's so damn expensive.
Yeah.

You cannot find this on the Net.
That's for sure.

But stealing it from
a Russian Mafia boss. Come on.

Russian Mafia?

In fact, he's got some friends...

very nasty guys.

If they found out about this...

you'd end up with your balls
stuffed and sewn inside your mouth.

So, the deal about the...

Here's the deal, Rudy.
I'm giving you an easy out.

I'll take this hot potato off your
hands, and I'll assume the risk.

Risk is my business, okay?

You're not listening, Rudy.

A second, please.

Hello?
Rudy, where are you?

You promised to call me tonight.

I'm in a business meeting.

Really? What,
are you buying a disco?

Dad, please.
I can hear that Snoopy Dogg music.

Where are you going?

Well, that is just what
I am trying to explain to you.

What is going on?
Give it to him.

Hey, come here!

My egg.

Move!

Move it!

Oh, shit.

My eyes!

Got a problem here?

Hey, can I make a phone call
over here?

Not just yet, Rudy. I heard
you had a big night last night.

How are you gonna pay for it?
Sell your Ferrari?

I had a bad night, okay?

Why do I have to look
at your face in the morning?

Is your father Oscar Cafmeyer?

Yeah. Why?

Yesterday, there was a valuable
manuscript in this case.

Last night, Security
discovered it missing.

So what?

Your father was the last one
to leave the building.

This morning, nobody seems
to know where he is.

Maybe it's a case
of "like father, like son"?

You're full of shit!
Rudy, relax.

Why should he break the glass
if he had a key?

Nobody's making
any accusations here.

We just want to ask him
some questions.

Do you know where he is?

Rudy, I have been trying
your mobile.

All I get is this recording.

Oh, never mind.
I will try again later.

Rudy, I am staying
at an old friend's home.

You remember Walt Finley.
He is teaching at Ben-Gurion University.

Now, this is his number.
97 2...

Dad, how are you?
Thank God you are there.

Where are you?
Israel.

Israel!
Pay attention, please.

Listen, I was just
at the police station.

Do you know what they're saying?
Not now, Rudy.

I'm afraid I might have gotten
myself into some big trouble.

What do you mean?

What are you doing?

Who's that?

Can you book me on the first flight
to Israel, Tel Aviv?

Right away.

Take your glasses off, please.

Visiting Israel
on business or pleasure?

Pleasure. Always.

Excuse me.
What's the delay?

Mr. Cafmeyer, our database shows
that you've had several arrests...

for illegally transporting
artifacts.

Does it also show
I was never convicted?

Please open your carry-on.

Do you have any artifacts
which you have not declared?

Oh. The Mona Lisa.

You like to joke, huh?

They say laughter
opens up the soul.

Well, while we're at it, let it
open the rest of your luggage too.

You're joking, right?

You know, this is bullshit.
No, Mr. Cafmeyer.

This is Israel.

I apologize for the inconvenience.
Security is extra tight this month.

Muslims are making their pilgrimage
to Jerusalem for Ramadan.

Passport, please.
Rudy Cafmeyer!

Who is this?
Walter Finley.

Professor of archeology
at Ben-Gurion University.

And what is your relationship
to this man?

Not that it's
any of your business.

I'm a friend of his father's.

I've known that kid
since he was in knickers...

which would have put you
in diapers.

Now, are there any more
insurmountable obstacles...

we have to overcome here,
young lady?

Thank you for your cooperation.

Shalom.

Good to see you, Rudy.
Good to see you too.

Where's my dad?
Let's get your bags into my car.

Watch where you go, putz!
Up yours!

Cafmeyer's a cranky old fool.

Calls me two days ago
to pick him up at the airport.

So I take him back to my house.
We have dinner, talk, catch up.

What was he doing here?
I'm getting to that.

What is this,
the Spanish Inquisition?

A few years ago, he uncovered some
scrolls near the Syrian border.

They were the lost final chapter
of the Fazar...

written by Le Vaillant himself.

What was he doing?
Translating it?

More than that. He was writing
a history of the sect.

An unauthorized history.

He's been E-mailing me
his chapters...

having me lock them up
in a safe deposit box here.

Why a safe deposit box in Israel?
Because he trusted me.

Here's the key.
You ought to have it anyway.

Okay, where can I find these guys?

I'll show you.

Their monastery
is in East Jerusalem...

the other side
of the Mount of Olives.

We're wasting time. Let's go.

The present-day Order is just
as reclusive as it ever was.

Fanatically adverse to publicity.

No contact with the outside world.

You'd do better trying to get
an audience with the Pope.

Son of a bitch.
Those are the guys...

that came by the house
and picked up your dad.

Hey, you!
Let's go!

Jump in. I'll drive.
You don't know the way!

You'll navigate.

Be careful.
This is a classic car.

Professor, buckle up.

Get down!

Watch the truck!

My car!

Shit.

Sorry about the car.

There they are.
Let's nail these sons of bitches.

You okay?

I'm fine.
Good.

Where's my father,
you son of a bitch?

I'm gonna kill you!

You okay?
Finley, look out!

Don't move!
He needs a doctor. Help me!

Hey, it's not me!
Get up!

You are telling us...

these men kidnapped your father?

They took him somewhere,
and no one's heard from him.

Mr. Cafmeyer, I can smell
bullshit a mile away.

And you're only five feet from me.

I believe you are using the alleged
disappearance of your father...

as a cover to smuggle artifacts
out of Israel.

Alleged?

My father was here,
and now he's missing!

That has nothing to do with
the reason you are now in custody.

You were found next to the corpse
of a prominent professor.

Let me guess. Now you
are accusing me of killing him?

Until we have more facts,
all options are open.

I'm placing you under house arrest.
You'll be taken to a hotel...

where you will remain until
we complete our investigation...

into the professor's death.

Know why you're smelling bullshit?

Because you're
up to your nose in it.

I'll be in the room next door
if you need anything.

What about a taxi?
Within reason.

And what about my father?
We are looking into the matter.

Good night.
Good night, officer.

Lieutenant Barr. Dalia Barr.

Thank you.

How are you?
Okay.

Thanks.

Go!

Rudy, let me explain
what happened in Odessa.

Explain what? You left me hanging
like a piece of laundry.

But, Rudy, there was this cop...

Admit it, you little slimeball,
or you'll never see your money.

What money?
The egg. I sold it.

Remember our deal? Ten percent?

That's 50 G's for you, my friend.

Lucky for you, this place
makes me feel very generous.

Thank you.

Rudy, do you have
the cash with you?

No. It's under my mattress.

Of course I have it.
But I'm leaving tonight.

Tonight?

Can we meet first? Please come
to my office in Tel Aviv.

I have a beautiful new penthouse
suite in the diamond district.

You'll be my special guest.

We'd like to use the phone.

I have a much better idea.

Is that you, Rudy?

You slimeball!
You almost got me killed.

Rudy, it wasn't my fault.

You owe me.
Owe you?

You owe me.
What do you mean?

You owe me, I said.
Anything, Rudy. Anything.

Just listen.
Tell me what I can do to help.

I need this map translated.
Can you do it?

Sure?
Sure. I'm positive.

I promise, friend.
What are you talking about?

And this disk printed.
Done. Anything for you.

Understand something.
I know where you sleep...

I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
There were cops over there!

Cops. Let's split up.
I'll call you. Go.

Stop!

Oh, you maniac.

Look! There he is! Stop!

You! Hey, you! Stop!

Get away! Hey, stop!

Hey, you! Stop!

Stop!

Come on!

Don't move!

Freeze!

We got him! Nobody move!

Excuse me.

Cuff him!

Do you know how much trouble I'm in
because of you?

Let's have a coffee
and talk about it.

Well, Mr. Cafmeyer, you have proved
that my original hunch was correct.

You cannot be trusted.

I came here to look for my father.

I did what I had to do because
nobody else seems to give a shit!

On the contrary.
We spoke to Immigration.

They have no record of your father
entering the country.

That's impossible.
What's really going on?

Were you, perhaps, planning
to smuggle out a little something?

Hey, those are mine!
What's going on here?

We checked you out of the hotel.
You may change at the airport.

You're going home.

You cannot do that.
I can and will.

Can I trust you to take him
to the airport without him escaping?

Yes, sir.

What about Finley's murder?
You're no longer a suspect.

I'm still your only witness!
We have your testimony, thank you.

Enjoy your flight, Mr. Cafmeyer.

You're not helping me!
Come on!

You're full of shit!
What's going on here?

What did you find?

Today, as every year at this time...

we come to this special place...

to commemorate the departure...

of the Knights of Christendom
from these shores.

Brother Cyrus will now lead us
in a passage from the Fazar.

Thank you, First Disciple.

As was prophesied
in the Book of Tribulations...

we await the return
of the Army of God...

who shall rise like a tide
against the sea...

of those who do not believe.

Cyrus...

by what authority do you quote
from that disreputable source?

As second disciple, you of all
our brothers should know better!

I beg your forgiveness.
It was an unpardonable error.

Le Vaillant himself once followed
a false path toward God.

We must choose our words carefully.

Wars have started for less.

I will ask for forgiveness
at evening vespers.

Your flight doesn't leave for
a few hours. You hungry?

Oh, someone here
actually cares about me.

We may be overly cautious
about our security...

and protective of our artifacts...

but we're not barbarians,
Mr. Cafmeyer.

It would be a shame if you left
without sampling some fresh hummus.

You like?

I'd like it more without this.
Sorry.

Look, I came here to find my father.

He told me he was in trouble.

He's the type of guy
who never lies.

Sounds like you really care
about him.

The two of you must be very close.

He taught me everything...
about paintings, antiques.

You name it.
Well, you applied that knowledge.

Let's say I did.
I never meant to hurt him.

And that's bothering you now?

Yes, because now he's missing,
and I'm realizing what I missed.

Why am I telling you all this?

You're tired.
You're jet-lagged.

You'll feel a lot better
once you're back on the plane.

I'll feel better when I find him.

This attack
was a brutal and senseless act...

perpetrated on a man who devoted
his life to God and to peace.

We, his brothers and sisters,
mourn his passing...

and pray that those responsible
find repentance in their hearts.

Who died?
Pierre Gardet...

the leader of some religious sect.

You mean the Order?

Come on. This way.

Come on.
Please keep on moving.

Get the prisoner off the plane.
I want him brought back here.

Why?

We've been informed
he's leaving with an artifact.

Customs checked him.
I saw him changing.

Just do it, Lieutenant!

What's going on?
You're staying in Israel.

What?
You're smuggling an artifact.

Do you believe that?

Something is not kosher here.
I'm not trying to be funny, okay?

When I signal,
run to the back stairs.

There's a service road
on the far side of the tarmac.

If you make it, I'll be waiting.
If I make it?

Now push me. Just push me.

Over here! He's escaping!

Quick!

Back up!

Quick! I need assistance up here!

What are you doing?

The stairs are slowing him down!
We can catch him!

Get in the back. Hurry.

Get down. You all right?

We missed him.
He went over the fence.

Okay, we're safe now.

Safe from what?
I've got some questions for you.

I used to belong to the Order.

What?

You should have told me this before.

Rudy, I couldn't.

Of course not,
because you're part of it.

No, because I didn't know
any of this was related.

Sure. You dealt with my father.
Where are you going?

I just risked my ass for you!
Why?

So you can hand me over
to the Order?

I left the Order when I was 18.
Oh, you left the Order?

I wanted to create my own life.

So meeting you at the airport
was no accident, right?

Look, Rudy, let me just explain
a few things to you, okay?

Most of the followers
are peaceful and life-affirming.

There is a small group of fanatics
who believe in a darker path.

They call themselves
the Army of God.

They've been on standby for years.

And you think these are the guys
who took my father?

I don't know, Rudy. They might also
be the ones who killed Gardet.

Hey, Rudy, my friend.

Who's the cop?
Everything's fine. She's with us.

Look, my friend. Look what I
printed out for you from the disk.

It's not translated yet, but...
It looks like a map of Jerusalem.

Middle Ages, European design.

What's the language?
Aramit.

It was the language of Palestinian
Christians during the Crusades.

Okay, see these lines
here and here?

They are caves and tunnels
beneath the old city.

They've remained hidden
since the Holy Wars.

Professor Finley
told me about those.

But what he didn't tell you
was what they lead to.

Ask yourselves, why would
an archaeology professor...

bring the scrolls to New York
but leave the map in Israel...

hidden inside a safe deposit box?

Because the map leads to something
even more valuable.

It's the people who just left.
They forgot something.

Let's hide this.

Hands in the air!

Get them up!

Move!

Where is it?

Freeze!

Fuck!

Give me that.

Come on.

Thank you, Avram.

After all this time,
you come back to me like this.

You know I've had to make
some difficult choices.

You chose to leave.

Please, can we talk
about this later?

I really need some water
and clean rags right now.

Here's some water.

Thank you, Avram.

Where am I?

A friend's.

How long have I been here?

Two days now.

You really should rest.

I'm okay.

Well enough to leave?

Israeli hospitality kills me.

No, it just saved your life.

Here.

Your father's book.
Yeah.

I've been going through this.

You really should too.

The last chapter
predicts a revolution...

one that is peaceful
and spiritual in nature.

This will not be good news
to the radical Army of God...

who contend that Le Vaillant
prophesied a catastrophic holy war.

I suspect this militant faction
will stop at nothing...

to suppress the true contents
of this final chapter.

Though my own safety
may be at issue...

I have requested an interview
with the first disciple...

to make these matters known.

Your scholar
seems to be on the verge...

of enlightenment.

It wouldn't hurt you
to sample some of it yourself.

Dalia, the world
is as filled with temptations...

as it is with false prophets.

Onions. I need onions.

Is everything okay?
We were just...

We were just discussing
your father's manuscript.

It's a fraud.

A fraud?

The scrolls, they were tested.

By whom? Secular scientists?

If you would just open your mind.
To what?

To this, Avram.

What is this?

What is this?

It's mentioned in the Thesuar.

Solomon's gold. A treasure the
ancient Hebrews hid under the city.

Which might explain why people with guns
have been chasing us all over Israel.

It explains nothing
but your ignorance.

The treasure is a metaphor
for the wisdom of the ancient sages.

Avram, I need to
get to the monastery.

I think they're holding my father.
Impossible.

No outsider is permitted.

What about an insider?

A member from overseas
that is here on pilgrimage.

That's Cyrus...

the new first disciple.

Children of God...

I stand here before you today...

in great sorrow...

for what should be a celebration
of hope and joy...

must instead be looked upon
as a call to action.

God's vengeance
for this murderous deed...

will be swift and without mercy.

May the eternal spirit
of Pierre Gardet...

guide us on this path
of deliverance.

It's the best time
to see if my father's alive.

Try the catacombs first.

That door leads
to a small stairway.

Follow it all the way down.

Be careful.

Dad, are you all right?

Yes.

Let me get you out of here.

I already tried.

No, forget about me.

You have to stop him.

Pull off that tarp.

You will see
what this is all about.

Rudy, go. Go.

This looks like...

A bomb?

Sorry we're late, Mr. Cafmeyer...

but I could give a shit
about this coronation.

Tonight...

we will all witness a miracle...

as God's fury cleanses the souls
of those who stand against us.

Let the new age...

begin!

Where are you going?
To find Rudy.

We have to put a stop to this.

All right, I'm coming with you.

This way.

Dalia, stop!

It's a trap!

Now, be a good girl, Dalia,
and come down here.

And since when did you take your vows
with the Order, Major?

The day Cyrus vowed there was
a treasure under the temple mount.

That's the day I found religion.

Hello, Professor.

Dad...

meet Dalia.

She's a good cop.

Now let's ask the major...

what the big bomb is for.

It's Ramadan.

Islamic leaders from around the world
will be on the temple mount at noon.

What are you saying?

This nutcase is gonna blow it up?

That will start World War III.

Especially when
they find the bodies...

of an Israeli and an American
beneath the rubble.

Oh, no, you're crazy.
This is impossible.

You have completely misinterpreted
the words of the first disciple.

And you...

are a naive moron.

You have truly lost the way, Cyrus.

On the contrary...

I have found it.

I want to thank you,
young Cafmeyer...

for unwittingly providing
the final piece of the puzzle.

And thank you, Avram...

for your unwavering
loyalty and devotion.

But, First Disciple,
what they're saying here is insane.

If you've read the Book of Tribulations
carefully, you are aware...

that the Holy War is triggered
by a singular event.

Behold the event.

And as my unwavering one...

I shall grant you the privilege
of assisting us.

Bind him...

and her too.

Now, where is my guide?

Dad!

Stop!

There is no need for that!

Does this mean you'll be
assisting us too, Professor?

What's he talking about?

With the map you brought us, your father
can now guide us under the temple mount.

Please.

Millions will die.

It is written.

"I will raze Mt. Moriah
and build upon it a new temple."

That prophecy you are quoting
is a fabrication.

Wait. Don't do shit for him.

Apparently...

stubbornness is
an ingrained family trait.

Beats a messiah complex any day.

Stop! I will do it.

I will guide you.

God help us all.

He helps those
who help themselves, Professor.

We are near the temple mount.

That is where the traps begin.

Perhaps we should use
someone expendable to lead the way.

Young Mr. Cafmeyer...

we have a job for you.

Be careful.
Okay.

Go.

Somebody help him! No!
Let me go, damn it!

Be careful, Rudy!

Come on, Avram.

You deceived me.

This is the way,
according to the map.

Then how do we proceed?
What's the matter with you guys?

You see these beams?
We take them down and build a bridge.

Oh, my God.

This is not the well of souls.

In the next chamber, I swear!

Show me.

Directly above us...

the Dome of the Rock...

Islam's third-holiest shrine.

And henceforth,
from this day forward...

the holiest shrine in the Order.

Cyrus, I beg you to reconsider.

Bring the bomb.

Hold on. Hold on.

We'll get to that.

First we fill these bags.
There's no time.

Take a look around you, Cyrus.

There's a king's treasure here...

enough to finance
ten of your holy wars.

We set the bomb now.

We can do this the easy way...

or the very easy way.

I have a prophecy to fulfill.

And I have a Swiss
bank account to fill.

That's the only reason I joined
your crazy scheme in the first place.

Idiot!
Professor, here!

Stop them!
Don't let them get away!

Rudy! Your dad!

Dad, you're hit.

Come on.

Let's go. Over here.

Dad, you stay here.
We'll be back for you.

I'll be fine.
Let's go.

They did not come this far.

We must have passed them.
Come on, let's double back.

Let's split. Go.

Get after him.
I'll take care of that bitch.

Help me with these.

Assist him.

Shit!

Hey, Dad, meet Dalia.

She's the dead cop!

Wrong, Major.

Professor.

Are you okay?
I'm fine.

Take my father out of here.
What about you?

I've got to stop the bomb.

Please be careful.

Come on, Professor.

Let's go.

Are you ready for this?
Thank you.

The bomb is set.

It's irreversible.

The prophecy will be fulfilled...

and I will vanquish my enemy.

You can't stop the prophecy.

You read the wrong book, pal.

Now...

it's time to say...

bon voyage!

Shalom!

Please stay calm.

My main man!

Hey, this is great.

Just a few more to sign,
and then we can go to lunch.

Take your time.

Don't touch that!

I'm sorry.
What is this?

It is a map
which purports to show...

the location of the fabled seven cities
of Cibola, near Cancun...

on the Yucatan Peninsula.

Oh.

These, ostensibly...

are the legendary...

cities of gold...

containing the Mayan treasure...

which the Spanish conquistadors...

so desperately had sought.

And, to answer
your inevitable next question...

yes, it is quite valuable.

So, where to, young Cafmeyer?

Cancun, Mexico.

Will that be business or pleasure?

Pleasure, always.

Cut.
