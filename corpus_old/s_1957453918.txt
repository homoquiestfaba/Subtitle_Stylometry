[curtains flapping]
[dramatic music]

[heart beating]

[fire roaring]

[dramatic piano music]

[paper rustling]

[dramatic piano music]

Hi, Mom it's Josh.

Obviously, got your message.

Just been practicing.

I know, surprise, right?

Um, anyway, the piece
is really shaping up.

Can't wait to play it for you.

I can't really get there

before morning, so hopefully it
can wait.

Um, okay, see you for breakfast.

Love you.

[soft piano music]

[peddle thudding]

Good morning, Charlotte.
Morning.

Where are you going now?
Just going.

You're always going.
What can I say?

I'm busy.

[Corinna sighs]

Happy birthday, Grandma.

Coconut chocolate?
Of course.

Oh!

When are you going to
sit down and practice?

You're welcome.

Thank you, dear.

When are you going to practice?

January.

Show me your hands.

These fingers have not touched
the piano.

All up here.
Oh!

All up here. [speaks in foreign
language]

Internet is ruining your work
ethic, everything is too easy.

It is Grandma, especially
that pest, YouTube,

filling our brains with
infinite amounts of information.

I'm surprised you have
any brain left at all.

Grandma, why are you on my
case?

[Corinna sighs]

Got it, I promise.

Go, prove it to me.

[bright piano music]

It's tomorrow, yes?

Whatever happens, happens.

Up against some tough pianists.

That's never stopped you
before.

Back in my day, we just made
music.

We didn't have to compete to
earn a living for ourselves.

I know, I know.

"Competition's are for
horses not artists."

Who said that?
Your grandpa. [chuckles]

But Bartok said at first,

If you are going to have to
compete to earn your supper,

you've got to commit.

You will be up against
kids that eat, drink,

and sleep with Bach,
Beethoven and Horowitz.

[laughs] Grandma.
Laugh all you want,

but I know that Victor Zabov
has a new favorite to win.

Uh, Jake or Josh or something.

A favorite, it's not a horse
race.

And what do you mean, you heard?

My musical school is a
hot topic at bridge club?

This is serious, believe me.

Zabov knows all the tricks.

Please, if there was
someone of that caliber,

I'd know about him.
You can't just

float through this one.

I don't think I'm going to
compete.

Yes you are.

And besides, if I'm there
too long then who's gonna

take care of you?
You don't worry about me.

You just get yourself ready.

I've never asked you for
anything,

but I am asking you to
take this one seriously.

Grandma, don't get all-
Charlotte,

I've got to know you'll
be okay after I die.

Grandma, stop.
I've got to know.

I need to know.

It's just the competition.

We both know that's not true.

[soft piano music]

You remind me of your mother.

Naturally gifted, incredibly
stubborn.

You're going to win that
competition tomorrow.

And she'd be so proud.

[soft piano music continues]

[bike rattling]
[dramatic piano music]

[children playing]

[Josh sniffing]

[bike rattling]
[dramatic piano music]

[birds chirping]

[both laughing]

[indistinct chattering]

Yeah, it was, I'll give you
that.

When am I gonna see you?
Oh, gosh, soon.

I'm here.
Yeah?

I'm here.
All right.


Mm!
So good to see you.

Good to see you.
It's good to be back.

Hey, Josh!

Josh, wait up!

[bike rattling]

Josh!

[dog barking]

What do you want?

Just a moment to talk with my
son.

You're 20 years too late.

I know, but I'm back for good,
I swear.

I'm here for good.

I can't deal with this right
now.

Josh, Josh, stop!

[birds chirping]

[children playing]

Thank you.

Thank you.

Your mom tells me about the
competition.

She says every pianist who's won

goes on to have lucrative
careers.

That's exciting.

I'm proud of you.

Hey, you know, it would mean
a lot to me if you'd come by.

It's no big London
competition, but it's a start.

For me to be here for good.

You would name an entire
gallery after yourself.

[bike rattling]

[chattering on TV]


Good morning, Barbara.
[door closes]

How you doing, you look well
today.

Uh, thank you, your
mom's in the kitchen.

Thanks.

[pills rattling]

Ew, boy, when was the
last time you showered?

You can't keep a schedule like
this without getting sick.

You need sleep and food that
doesn't come from a paper bag.

Why do you give him the time
of day?

How did he even know where to
find you?

Josh.
And you're okay with that?

You can just pick up
right where you left off

whenever he feels like showing
up?

There are things you
don't understand yet.

And I don't like what's
been happening to you.

You're in the practice room day
and night.

It's not healthy.

Look at you, how many hours
a week are you working now?

I do it for you.

I'm going to make things better
for you.

He's your father, you need
him.

I forgot, look what I have.

And it's not your
job to take care of me.

Mom.


Uh, touring, but yeah.

People change, Josh.

Take Barbara, you know, it'll
be fun.

You're coming, right?

I have to work tonight.

Not to his thing,
tomorrow, the competition.

I have to work, sweetie.
Okay, my point exactly.

I don't like how much
you're working lately.

I keep telling you, I could get
a job.

It might be nice change.

We're not gonna get into this
again.

Getting through school is your
job,

putting you through school is
mine.

So many rich people go to that
school.

And maybe I could find you
some new clients, you know?

One of them would equal three
Barbaras.

Watch your mouth!

Those people don't need me,
the Barbaras of the world do.

I'm going to win for us.

Barbara.

Mm, I need to get back to
practice.

Boy, you better get
in there and say hello.

So I understand you're leaving
us.

Hope so, especially now.

Well, you win and you
get to see the whole world.

And take your mom with you.

Yes, that's the point.

Stop, both of you.

If I win, you're coming with
me.

Otherwise, all my hard work
will have been for nothing.

[Barbara chuckling]
Am I doing mom-guilt properly?

Yes, very well done. [laughs]

Hmm.

Did you see your father
earlier?

Barbara, how did you know
that was Josh's father?

I'm old, not dumb.

They are the spitting
image of one another.

Yeah, well looks are
all we have in common.

Josh!

Take a shower and go to bed.
[Josh sighs]

All right, peace and blessings.

Bye, Barbara.
Good luck, Maestro.

[bell ringing]

[students chattering]

[door opens]

[door closes]

Is it too much to ask

that one of you will be at
the piano when class begins?

A little enthusiasm, people.

Beatrice, Beatrice.

Let's hear your Beethoven.

Yes, Mr. Dempster, yes, sir.

[dramatic piano music]

[door opens and closes]

[chair clicks]

I think we've heard enough.

You all have smartphones, right?

I've been reading about apps
lately.

I've heard they have one
were you can keep track

of how many hours you practice.

Um, would anyone like

to volunteer to help me download
an app?

You, sir.

You can leave now.

You seem so much more
enthusiastic

about this technology
than you do the music.

I'm serious!

I don't have room in this
class for dilettantes!

If any of the rest of you

would rather play with your
phones,

you're free to go with him!

[door opens]
I don't care

if you know how to download an
app!

Just like I don't care if you
have

[phone buzzing]
rehearsals scheduled

or classwork to do.

And I particularly don't care,
if you have a social life!

You're all here for one thing,
the music!

Oh, and for those of you
that have been chosen

for the final round of the
competition,

the only thing you'll be doing

between now and tomorrow is
practicing!

You've never experienced this
kind

of competition with these kinds
of stakes!

Nerves will take over!

London Prize only comes
around once every five years.

So you won't get another shot!

Josh, you're next.

[dramatic piano music]

You think you're expressing
innocence, but it's not working.

You need to play this
piece from the viewpoint

of an old man, as though
he's remembering his youth.

Listen to yourself, dig deep.

Let me hear you as if
you were 70, understand?

Now, go practice, you all
know what you need to do.

It's been years to this point,
folks.

And now it's tomorrow night.

If you've made it this far,
you have what it takes to win.

[bell ringing]
Although I'm starting

to wonder if it's all a fluke.

Come on.

[door closes]

[dramatic piano music]

[footsteps tapping]

So now we're supposed

to play from the point
of view of an old man.

Sometimes I wonder if
we're in a music school

or is this a real acting school.

[dramatic piano music]

Charlotte.

And you're the Josh
I've been hearing about.

Don't worry, it's okay.

Uh, I don't know who
you've been talking to.

Well Zabov is crazy
about you, that's obvious.

[dramatic piano music]

You look like you could use a
break.

Wanna hang out, get out for a
while?

Did you hear him?

I can't go anywhere, shouldn't
you be practicing too?

Even if you're not in the
competition,

like Zabov expects it.

Consider that a tip from one
of his most abused students.

So you practice because he
tells you?

I practice because I
wanna win the competition.

I wanna have a career.

So are you coming with me?
[dramatic piano music]

You know, I could help you.

Help me?
Yes.

[Josh scoffs]

[bright piano music]

Tell you what, why not play
hooky for this afternoon?

Or are you afraid Zabov will
catch you?

[Josh scoffs]

You know how crazy things get
around here

before a competition.

That's called practicing.

You see a guy standing on his
head

while he practices, you know
you've been here for too long.

What guy?

You know when you see him,

and when you do, you know
it's time to get out of here.

[Josh sighs]

[dramatic piano music]

Well, if you change your
mind, I'll be around.

You know, you're not going
to find what it means

in the practice room.
And what exactly...

[door closes]

[footsteps tapping]

It's way too tethered,
do you understand?

[students chattering]

Ah, Joshua Irving.

A word, please.

What happened in class today?

You seemed distracted.

Nerves, I guess.

If you win this competition,
you'll be in demand.

They won't all be big concerts,
but concerts, nonetheless,

college towns, small cities.

[phone ringing]

Did you know that there are
people

who don't want to see you
in this competition, Joshua?

You have to want it.

I gave up everything
important for my career.

Are you ready to do that?

And you've got to work twice
as hard because of who you are.

Here you go.

Two totally different
interpretations of your Beethoven.

Listen, get some ideas.

Hey oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't know you had a student
in here.

I'll come back.

No, no, we're winding up right
now.

This is Josh.

He's in the finals tomorrow.

That's quite an honor,
what piece have you chosen?

Uh, "Pathetique."
Really?

Well that's quite an intense
piece for a man so young.

He handles it like a
man beyond his years.

You'll never get another
chance

like the one you have tomorrow.

Victor, will I see you tonight?

Ah, crowds aren't my thing.

[woman chuckles]

Uh, thanks for these.

Josh, you may think I'm harsh,

but out there are people
who will judge you harshly

based on everything from your
technique to your skin color.

You've got to be flawless.

You've got to play so

that they have no excuse not to
hire you.

Do you understand?

All right.

[soft violin music]

[woman vocalizing]

[Josh sighs]

[woman shrieks]
Dude, get out!

[door closes]

[drumsticks tapping]

[fingers tapping]

[bright piano music]

[Josh sighs]

[soft piano music]

[drums banging]

[drums continue banging]

Hey, Mom, Um, I know you're at
work.

I'm just here practicing,
probably for a few more hours

and then I'm gonna head home
early.

So call me if you need anything.

[traffic whirring]

[Josh sighs]

[soft piano music]

[phone buzzing]

mom gave me your number.

Uh, said I should call.
[dramatic piano music]

You know how convincing she can
be.

Anyway I'm really hoping you'll
come to the opening tonight.

It would mean a lot to me.

I just wanna share this with
you.

[pounds keys]

[birds chirping]

[students chattering]

Saw him?

Yeah, it's something like
that.

I just needed a break.

What's with the balloons?

They're for my niece.

You know, when I asked you to
hang out

for a while, I mean, it was
longer than just a break.

I have to be somewhere now.

And we're gonna be there a
while.

Why me?

Why not?

Coming or not?

You got a car?

[bright piano music]

[bike rattling]

[children playing]
Happy birthday, Amy.

Kazoos, thanks, Aunt Char.

Who are you, are you my aunt's
boyfriend?

Daddy, who's that man?

Well, I hope for his sake,
the balloon delivery man.

Daddy, you silly.
[laughs] Yeah.

Cute, yours?

So how did my sister rope you
into this?

I volunteered.

Huh, that's what he thinks.

Uh, take this. [chuckles]

Um, I'm sorry I don't have a
present.

Oh no worries.

All the presents are donations

for the local animal shelter,
anyway.

Amy insisted.
She's a weird child.

Laney.

[upbeat kazoo music]

[children screaming]

[children chattering]

[upbeat kazoo music]

All right, well, I guess
we'll cover this later.

Okay.
Sorry.

What is she up to?
Oh, give 'em a break.

They're a cute couple.
It's not so fun

when it's your party, is it?

Ah, could you go get the cake,
please.

[upbeat kazoo music]
[children playing]

Uh, go sit over there, come on.

I'm Bryn, by the way.

Oh, sorry, Josh.

And you've met Laney,
our neighbor's daughter.

But she's here so much, she's
like family.

And inside's my husband Milo.

So how long have you known my
sister?

Oh, we just...

Not long. [chuckles]

And do you play piano?

Yeah, actually, apparently
we're at the same conservatory.

"Apparently."

We have a family full of
musicians.

Um, Amy is just starting to take
lessons,

and Milo plays cello.
[upbeat kazoo music]

Though, not so much anymore.

Um, are you competing
tomorrow in the London com...

[upbeat kazoo music]

You like our song, Amy and
I are gonna start a band.

Oh.
The Kazoo Keepers.

You get it, you get it?


So is Josh coming tonight?

Is that within our schedule?

Well, I have to go practice,
actually.

So I don't think that's gonna
happen.

Oh, you could take a
page out of his book, huh?

See, Charlotte's so naturally
gifted,

she takes things like
practicing.

We have to go.
For granted.

Look at that.

Here you go.
Oh.

But we haven't had cake yet.

[bright jazz music]

Poor kid.
[Bryn sighs]

[children playing]

Cake!

[children cheering]

So where can I drop you?

We had an understanding.

You said you wouldn't weird out
on me.

Don't do that.
Do what?

You say like I said something
I didn't.

Well, we're here now
and it's still early

and I know you want to be alone

and this competition is a big
deal

to you, but I'm gonna be
late if I don't go now

and it's on the way back

to school and I promise
we're gonna go right back

to school and I'll be out of
your hair.

It's on the way?

Okay.

[door opens]

[muffled jazz music]

[students cheering]

This my friend Josh.
Woo!

[indistinct chattering]

Right, rock stars, button it
up.

Wanna show Josh what we worked
on?

Yeah!
Yeah.

One, two.

[smooth jazz music]

[hard rock music]

[students cheering]
Woo, yeah!

Way to go!
Yeah!

[students laughing and
chattering]

You composed that?

I mean, then they busted
out with that rock riff.

I don't even understand
where that comes from.

Like how, what made
you put that with jazz?

I put things I like.

Um, like what kind of
music do you listen to?

What do you mean?
What's on your playlist?

I don't know, Beethoven, Bach,
Mozart.

[Charlotte mimics snoring]

yours?

Led Zeppelin, John
Coltrane, Taylor Swift.

Taylor Swift?

You can't live in the
world doing the same thing

over and over and expect to be
inspired.

Besides, Taytay knows how
to get the party started.

So why classical?

What do you mean?

Why are you studying classical
music, why did you pick it?

I don't know, I...

It picked me, I guess.

I mean, I was around age six
when I started taking lessons.

And it came easy in a way.

You know, my anger just seemed
to flow right into the music.

Why were you angry at six?

Um, so what's the deal with
you and those kids anyway?

Like, are you like a teacher?

I volunteer there once a week.

Music helped me when I was a
kid.

Figure it was something small
I could do to bring back.

Besides, it's fun.

[Josh chuckles]

Speaking of ways to have fun,
how's working with Zabov?

Huh!
[Charlotte chuckles]

How long have you been with
him?

Four years.
Oh my God.

Yeah.
Ooh!

Wanna hear something funny?

Okay.

My grandma and Zabov
used to have a thing.

A thing?

And it was serious,
apparently.

She talks about him all the
time,

but she would never admit that.

I think it's hilarious.
[siren wailing]

It's basically the reason why
I avoided studying with him.

So how's that going anyway?

What, your grandma and Zabov?

You and Zabov.


I need that.

Yeah?
Yeah.

You know, like discipline.

[bike rattling]

What?

We've been in the same school,
both

about to graduate, and yet
I have never ever seen you.

You've never been to a single
party,

to a single school competition
or show.

I mean, I bet you spent all of
your time in a practice room.

This little 10 by 10 practice
room,

doing nothing but practicing all
day

and eating food delivered to
you.

I mean, I'm sorry, but that's
just

some unpleasant problem with
discipline.

You have me all figured out,
huh?

Well, you missed the part

where I haven't been here all
four years.

Zabov pulled strings
and got me in this year.

Apparently, he felt community
college was beneath me.

Yeah.

Tell you what, the $30
classes weren't beneath me.

Look, it's your first year

at conservatory and you made the
finals.

You're gonna win.
Huh.

Well, I guess if having
no life is winning.

So I was right, all of
your time in a practice.

I have to win.

"I have to win."

You'd think piano cured
cancer or something.

You wouldn't understand.

It's all anyone talks about.

There's more to life than music.

with the musical family.

I wish my family understood what
I did.

And you know, they try
to, but really I'm alone.

I'm alone at home, I'm alone in
school.

So my grandma's having
a birthday party tonight.

Wanna come?
[scoffs] The one

who's dating Zabov?

Ah, no, thank you.
Ew, no.

And that was a million years
ago.

I can't, I have been
out too long as it is.

I think you'd really like her.

Sounds fun, but you know,
discipline.

Yeah, yeah, Zoolander.

Listen, if you're not ready by
now, you will never be ready.

Okay, we've wasted enough time,
let's go.

What's this?
Whoa.

"The Art of Ted Urban Grand
Opening,

200, Josh, hope to see
you there, Love Dad."

Whatever.

[soft jazz music]

Back to school, right?

[Josh scoffs]

Oh, just one more stop on the
way, okay?

Where are we?
Oh, here, here.

Stop, stop, stop.
Here?

Yeah, yeah, good.

You're crazy, there's no one
here.

Gotta see this place.
Why?

And wouldn't it be better

to come back when it's opened or
never?

Scared?

Yeah, I'm scared of being a
black guy

caught breaking into buildings.

What are you doing?
[tool clattering]

No breaking, just entering.

[Josh scoffs]

[door closes]

Watch your step.

What is this death trap?

Why are you whispering?

This used to be a great concert
hall.

All the best of the
best used to play here.

Now they use it as a revival
church

and not even they can fill the
seats.

Yeah, no kidding.
Daniel should be

here somewhere.

Who's Daniel?

He's sort of a caretaker here.

Takes care of the place
and hooligans coming in.

Like us.
[glass shattering]

I know you're up there,
I hear you breathing.

Come on guys!

Daniel.

Charlie, chaps, ooh, stand
back.

Got bats up here, three of 'em.

I brought a friend.

Oh, a friend?
Yes.

Are you a musician too?

The best, he's gonna be
a famous concert pianist.

A pianist, oh, you gotta see
this!

Come on!

Let's go.

Oh, boy, the acoustics are
just perfect.

It's so sweet.
[dramatic choral music]

It's a little torn up now, but
there's plans for a remodel.

It's gonna be sweet.

â™ª Call out â™ª

â™ª People ask me what it's all
about â™ª

â™ª Why I sing and shout â™ª

â™ª For his praise â™ª

â™ª People ask me why I kneel and
pray â™ª

â™ª Each and every one of my days â™ª

â™ª I feel love by watching
somebody else â™ª

â™ª Somebody else â™ª

â™ª It so easy, you can
find out for yourself â™ª

Imagine playing here to a full
house.

â™ª Just call out for his grace â™ª

Imagine that.
â™ª Call out for his grace â™ª

[singers clapping]

â™ª Ooh â™ª
â™ª All your troubles disappear â™ª

â™ª With God's grace â™ª

â™ª When you call out for his
grace â™ª

â™ª If you've been living â™ª
â™ª Living â™ª

â™ª In a place of fear and pain â™ª

â™ª Be forgiven â™ª
â™ª Be forgiven â™ª

â™ª Wash away that sense of stain â™ª

â™ª Among the righteous you can
come and take your place â™ª

â™ª When you call out for his
grace â™ª

â™ª Call out for his grace â™ª

â™ª Just call out for his grace â™ª

[woman laughs]
[group applauds]

Woo, oh.

Look at this.

[singers laughing]

Is that...

You know it.

[singers chattering]

[singers laughing]

You guys are good!

[singers laughing]

[footsteps tapping]

Look who it is, it's
our Charlie. [laughs]

How's your grandma?
She's good.

Doctors have to keep an eye on
her, but...

And you are?
Uh

um, Brendon DuBois.

I mean, sorry, no, you're Mr.
DuBois.

Um, I'm, uh...

Josh.
Josh.

Yes, hi, I'm a, I'm a fan.

You don't say.
Yes, no.

I was only nine years old the
first time I saw you conduct.

It was All Saints Symphony at
the Hall.

And I just, I used to
pretend to be you. [chuckles]

I would set up stuffed animals

and have them be my orchestra.

So I just, I just love
you in a very platonic

just sort of admiration
kind of, kind of way.

[singers laughing]

Well, well, thank you.
Yeah.

Thank you, why don't
you kids stick around.

We can always use some more
voices.

You sure don't wanna
hear me sing. [chuckles]

[singers laughing]

We can't, we have to go.
Oh, that's right.

The party, I forgot.

I wish I could attend.

Well, look out for her tonight.

We will.
Oh, I was talking about you.

[singers laughing]

All right, go.
Pleasure, sir.

Oh my pleasure, thank you.

Bye, honey, bye, honey.
Thank you.

Thank you.
See you.

Great job, thanks.
[singer laughs]

â™ª Call out, call out â™ª

â™ª Call out â™ª

Brendan DuBois?

How do you know him?

Seriously, I would give anything

just to be a fly on his wall.

Well, he is right there,
you can break in anytime.

how?

Grandma.
She knows him?

She's been there?

They used to play
together a long time ago.

And she's the one having the
birthday?

Yes, every year.

It's a tradition.

So are you coming?

[insects chirping]

[Josh sighing]

Yes, yes.

Ooh, just one more
stop on the way, okay?


Hey, Charlotte.

Late as always, glad you could
make it.

Hi, come on in.

[bright classical music]
[guests chattering]

Welcome to the Kraken Factory.

We do this thing where we,
playing and stuff for each other.

Kind of like the guys over
Ireland has.

Except these are the class
clowns.

Shut up, I prefer to think
of ourselves as open-minded.

Welcome to our somewhat
famous alt classical enclave.

What are you doing?

And what are you talking
about?

Who is he?

Just a friend.
Holy crap.

He's the guy.
No.

The guy from the competition
tomorrow.

The guy that you've been
stalking.

No, I wasn't stalking him.

Are you purposely trying
to sabotage the poor kid?

I was just curious, don't be
weird.

Hey, hey, what's been going on
with you?

I kinda don't wanna do the
competition.

And I haven't rehearsed like at
all.

Charlotte, you could
win that competition

with your eyes closed and
your fingers chopped off.

This time, it's different.

He's really good, like really
good.

Why do you care about
the competition at all?

You can just quit.

Grandma.

I'm sorry, sweetie, you are so
screwed.

[guests chattering]

All right, everyone.
Woo!

Yeah!
Woo!

Let's get this thing rolling.

[upbeat accordion music]

[bright folk music]

Woo!
[musicians cheering]

Woo, all right!
Woo!

Yeah!
All right!

[musicians laughing]

Let's do it again!
Yeah!

[musicians cheering and
laughing]

Whoo!
Whoo!

Goodnight.

See you next week.

[door closes]

[group laughing]

[soft keyboard music]

You ready?

This is so weird.

Why?

I don't know, it just is.

[soft keyboard music]

You just haven't gotten to
know it yet.

Come.

Hmm, come.

[soft keyboard music]

[woman clears throat]

Are you forgetting something?

Crap, grandma!

[soft jazz music]

[audience chattering]

Hello, beautiful lady.
Oh, Margerie, dear.

How are you?
Wonderful.

Happy birthday.
[Corinna chuckles]

Will you be singing for us
tonight?

Excuse me, dear.

Where's Charlotte?

Oh, you know, she's always
late.

Your husband should be here.

Well, he had to wait for the
sitter.

He'll be here soon.

need all of this anyway.

Oh, it's your birthday,
we have to celebrate you.

Besides, it's some
unwritten law that we have

to annoy our family members
with cake and presents.


Oh!
How are you, my sweet?

It is so good to see you, happy
birthday.

I cannot wait to hear you
dazzle us on the keys tonight.

Uh.
Bryn, tell her

this is her night and she
can have whatever she wants.

[Corinna chuckles]
Is everything okay over here?

What he says?
You get whatever you want.

[both laugh]

Isn't this nice?

Beautiful night, great friends.

Great music and no more protest.

[indistinct chattering]

[upbeat jazz music]

Oh, she's so old.

Grandma.
That is so delicious.

I dare you to throw it out.

Someone I want you to meet.

Oh!

This is my friend Josh.

Oh, yes, Josh the pianist.

Uh, happy to meet you, ma'am.

Please, ma'am is not
necessary.

So you are a Victor Zabov's new
student.

The next one in line for
all the accolades, yes?

[Josh chuckles]

I'm surprised he let you out
tonight.

He usually keeps very close
guard on all his musicians.

Hothouse musicians, we used to
call them.

So this is Charlie's idea, I
presume.

Gotta hand it to the girl.

She's a wily one.

[upbeat piano music]

It's my birthday.

And I want to hear my
granddaughter play.

Hmm, I'm not getting up there.

Why not?

Okay, I'll tell you what

if that bartender does a
cartwheel before she gets back

to the bar, you'll get up on
that stage.

Wait for it, wait for it.

It's gonna happen.

It did not happen, okay.

[Corinna laughs]

I'll tell you what.

Go up there, I go up there.

Oh, please.

The silly arguing, both of
you, you're musicians, yes?

Get up on that stage and play.

[bright piano music]

You know what?

Push.

Yeah.

[audience applauding]
Bravo, oh, bravo.

Come on Mr. Beethoven.

Put your fingers on the
keys and wiggle them.

[audience chattering]

[bright piano music]

[audience cheering]

Bravo!


Did that just happen?
Yes, it did.

That was unreal. [laughs]

Not too shabby, Mr. Beethoven.

That's my roommate's
girlfriend calls me.

She said it's 'cause I'm
a slob like Beethoven.

Oh, really?
[Josh laughs]

You look like a young Denzel
Washington when you laugh.

"We didn't land on Plymouth
Rock!

Plymouth Rock landed on us!"


As it's Malcolm X.

Is that a movie?
Oh, Charlotte.

No, no, no.

I've seen every Denzel
movie at least six times.

And not just because he's hot.

[crickets chirping]
[soft piano music]

I...
What is it?

I, I'm sorry.

Did I...
No.

Should I not have?
No.

this.

It's me, I shouldn't
have kept you out so long.

You have an important day
tomorrow and you should go.

Yeah, actually, yeah.

Yeah.
Okay, uh.

Yes.
Um, okay.

I'll just go grab a water.

Sure, yes.
For the long bus ride home.

[soft piano music]
[crickets chirping]

Really been a rough night in
there.

Thank you.
You know, heroes.

Mm. [exhales]

Are you out here fake smoking
again?

[Milo exhales]

[group chattering]

[Bryn laughs]

Some show, huh?

Well maybe we should go
easier on her, she is only 20.

Old enough to know what she's
doing.

You see it, right?

She's doing the same thing to
that kid.

You know what, maybe this
time it'll be different.

People don't change.

Are you forgetting that
maybe if things hadn't happened

that way we wouldn't have
happened?

Another drink, we got a
sitter.

Certainly that's cause for
celebration.

[both laughing]

[upbeat jazz music]

Ah, two waters please.

You bet.
Thank you.

There he is, man of the hour.

[Josh chuckles]

That's nice playing.

Thank you, thanks.

Did you ever do the
Beethoven cello sonatas?

No, but I'd love to.

Mm.
Anything else, gentlemen?

No, we're okay.
What are we drinking?

[glasses clink]
Yours truly did

many years ago at the
conservatory.

My accompanist was just a kid.

What was that like?

Humiliating!

[both chuckle]

Aren't you gonna ask me why?

Uh.
We just started the first

movement and she took off like a
bat out

of hell, Just ramrodded
through the whole thing.

Just pure ego.

She was a real piece of work,
that one.

I got slammed by the papers, but
the kid,

she gets rave reviews, they
loved her.

They just can't wait to
see your next appearance.

She was just a kid, right?

I'm sure she didn't mean
to, you know, sabotage...

Just watch yourself.

And what you see is not what you
get.

We will have no crying in our
beers

at this party, thank you.
Mm.

Oh, and they just put out
scallops wrapped in bacon.

Speaking my language.
[Josh and Bryn chuckle]

Here is to Beethoven ala bacon.

Mm, this vodka's gone bad.

Taste like water. [laughing]

Uh, yeah, excuse him.

Yeah, it's okay.

Um, nice performance earlier.

I didn't expect that, I thought
you were strictly classical.

Well, tonight's been
different.

This whole day has.

Are your parents coming?

I'd love to meet the
people who raised that one.

Oh, I'm sorry, did I say
something wrong?

No, no, it's okay.

Um, they're no longer with us.

There was a car accident.

I don't think Charlie even
remembers them.

She never talks about them.

I'm sorry.

Now she's the only one
who ever really got Charlie.

Your grandmother?
Yeah.

I mean, when Mom and Dad passed,

I was already pretty much out

of the house and Charlie
was still a toddler.

Well that explains the accent.

Oh, yeah.

Well, and Grandma raised
Charlie,

but I think she picked up the
accent

on purpose to be closer to her.

She's pretty great.

On the piano.

On the piano, yeah.

Look, Josh, I know it's none

of my business, but
that London competition.

Uh, don't remind me.

My teacher would yank
me from the competition

if he knew I was here.
So you do know that...

No, ooh, hi.
Mm.

Hi.
Hi.

Okay, well we'll talk later.

Okay.
Come, you.

All right.
Let's, let's, let's...

He's a good guy.

Hello everyone, hi, um...

Can I get two more
waters, please, sorry.

I would like to thank
our guest of honor.

And thank you all for coming.

Our guest of honor is Grandma
Corinna.

[guests cheering]

I think as a thank you gift for
us,

for her birthday, she should
sing us or play us something.

Yes!
Yes, yes!

[guests applauding]
Yes!

Those among the crowd,
come on, some cheering!

[guests cheering]
Yes, yes, yes!

Come on, come on!

[soft piano music]

â™ª As the wind strips the trees
bare â™ª

â™ª Dogwood blooms float here and
there â™ª

â™ª On the path where you declared â™ª

â™ª How much you care â™ª

â™ª Are you gone like the petals
in he air â™ª

â™ª As the steam would drift on
the lake â™ª

â™ª I would dream of hours we
would make â™ª

â™ª On the day when we declared â™ª

â™ª A love we shared â™ª

â™ª While our guests scattered
petals in the air â™ª

[audience applauds and cheers]

Thank you.

I must know a hundred melodies,

but the last few years I've been
playing

the same ones over and over.

I sit at the piano and it's
the same melodies all the time.

I don't know if I was trying

to perfect them or if I'm
just a creature of habit,

but then my hands couldn't
stretch as far.

And then it became
difficult to play at all.

And it's hard to admit
that even here on my,

hmm, birthday.
[crowd laughs]

When you love something
and then one day it's gone,

you realize that maybe
it's good that you decided

to have a life outside the
music, but I have no regrets.

I have lived fully.

And I have loved fully.

And now my Charlie is going
to take over in my footsteps

and make her grandma so proud.

Congratulations to
Charlotte and wish her well

for her big competition
tomorrow.

[audience applauding]

I thought you left
without saying goodbye.

Why is he here?

I think it's because of
grandma.

No, no, you said they weren't
a thing.

They're not.
Okay, I have to leave

before he sees me here,
but my bag is inside,

my bike is out front,
what am I supposed...

There's something else.

What, what else?

Josh, I need to tell you
something.

What, what, Charlotte, what?

There you are, missy.

I don't appreciate you
forcing me up on that stage.

And you, where are you
off to in such a hurry?

I have to go.

Zabov is gonna pull me

from the competition if he sees
me here.

That's absolutely correct.

Victor Zabov, nothing has
changed.

You're still an ass.

That's crass, Corinna.

If you don't let your
musicians live a little,

how are they going to bring
any life into their music?

He's a good teacher,
Corinna, he's just trying-

I can handle my own battles,
Josh.

Oh, you said something he
has always been able to handle.

His battles.

Let me take you home,
I have a car waiting.

Why?

So you can lock me in a room
like you do your musicians?

Not letting them live their
lives.

I do that for their own good.

Joshua wouldn't have gotten this
far,

if it wasn't for strict
discipline.

And now he's playing
for one of the greatest

competitions in the-
Oh, posh!

It doesn't matter who you're
playing for

or what you're playing.

A musician has to connect
with his audience.

I don't care if you play
every single note perfectly.

If you don't have anything
to say, don't waste my time.

And you, what you did in there
tonight,

now that was something special.

Oh, oh!
Grandma!

[Corinna groaning]
Corinna, are you all right?

I told you I was gonna take you
home.

Now I'll take you to the
hospital.

[Corinna groaning]
Lift her up. [grunts]

Josh, grab my purse.
Hold her, hold her.

Come on, go ahead, go.

Go, go, go.

[fire crackling]


I don't think she missed us one
bit.

Gosh, seeing those kids tonight

reminded me of how I used to be
with us.

When was the last time we were
all goofy

and playful like that?

Baby, hey,

it happened, it's over.

Besides, she's not the reason
you stopped playing, remember?

Come on, why did you stop
playing?

Because I quit auditioning.

Why?

'Cause that curmudgeon
conductor said my bow work

looked like a hippo with
arthritis.

Oh, come on, why?

'Cause I was losing my soul.

And it became about winning.

Do you regret our life together?

What, no.

No, I love our life.

You're right.

I love you.

Remember when it used to be
fun?

[bright jazz music]
No!

Yes, come on, play with me.

No!
Come on!

No, no, no.
Come on.

No, no, please, turn it off.

No.

Play with me.
No.

â™ª Some days it seems â™ª

[Bryn laughing]
â™ª We can't agree â™ª

â™ª And our duet's gone out of key â™ª

â™ª I wonder if this love's passe â™ª

Mm.
[Milo laughs]

â™ª But then you croon a note or
two â™ª

â™ª And soon my will to fight is
through â™ª

â™ª You sing my doubts and fears
away â™ª

â™ª Your smooth vivacious voice â™ª

â™ª Leaves me without a choice â™ª

â™ª And drives you right back to
my arms â™ª

[both laughing]

â™ª You're like a tidal wave â™ª

â™ª That washes me along â™ª

â™ª I'm a prisoner of your siren
song â™ª

â™ª Yes your siren song â™ª

[fire crackling]

[Josh sighing]

Don't be silly, I'm not dying.

Let's get you to bed.

I still think she should see a
doctor.

She needs an x-ray.

I'll call first thing in
morning.

Stop, all of you!

Can't an old woman have some
peace?

[Josh sighs]

[Corinna groaning]

So last time something
like this happened,

the doctor said it might
have been a mini-stroke.

He said it could come up again

with no warning, but she
keeps saying this was nothing.

She'll go to the doctor
tomorrow

if I have to take her myself.

Stubborn woman.

What I want to know is what's
going on between you two?

Don't you care for your
careers, your music?

I have been studying non-stop.

I convinced him to go.
For four weeks.

It wasn't even his idea.
This is the first night

I left, okay?
And he was practicing.

I'm sorry.
And I was helping him.

I messed up.
Silence!

Josh, I am disappointed.

You actually had what it takes
to win.

And then you go and do
something stupid like this.

Did you really think the way

to win was to sabotage another
competitor?

Wait, what?

If you just worked as
hard seated at your piano

as you do distracting Josh,

you'd have been the sure winner.

And you, after our talk today,

I don't understand this
behavior.

you.

Now go, both of you.

Get out of here!

[door opens and closes]

I'll stay here for Corinna.

[footsteps tapping]

[chain rattling]

Why won't you unlock?

Josh, please, I wanted to tell
you.

I tried to tell you.

When, like when did you
try to tell me, Charlotte?

When you, when you made me think
that

I was somehow special and you
wanted to hang out with me?

When you, when you used me

as your escort around town all
day?

Like when?
You can still win.

Oh my God, how long have
you been in the competition?

And you're one of the finalists?

Josh, please, you can still
win.

So was that your plan all
along?

To, to distract me, right?

Like throw me off my game.

Was that your plan?
Yes.

Yes, at first, but-
And the girl Milo

told me about that stole
his moment, that was you.

I didn't want to believe it,

that this girl that I...

That you what?
Forget...

What, Josh?
It doesn't matter.

Okay, not anymore.

Dammit, Charlotte, you put
my entire life in jeopardy.

Everything I've worked for!

Runner-up gets nothing, okay?

If I don't win this, then all
the lessons,

all the money that my mom put

in to pay for those lessons, for
nothing!

Because it isn't about
winning.

wanna go there right now?

I'm sorry, it's just,

everyone was talking about how
perfect

your technique was, how you
were everyone's favorite.

Because I spend my
life in a practice room!

I have done nothing but
work to get to this moment!

You could have done the
same thing instead of...

You couldn't even tell me
you were in the finals.

Do you really think that
would have changed anything?

Maybe, I just...

Josh, please.
Stop, stop it!

Charlotte, just leave me alone.

Okay, this day was a mistake.

My life, my plans,
everything's all jacked up!

You have no idea what it's like

for me here at this white-ass
school!

You think people are clamoring
to hire people like me?

People like you, but you're so
talented.

I can't make a single mistake.

Not one, you have no
idea what that's like.

Yes, I do, I'm a woman.

It's not the same!

Like you saying that just proves

you don't know what you're
talking about.

You just, you just coast
through,

not taking anything seriously,
just...

And somehow you got into the
finals

of one of the most prestigious
competitions in the worst!

Why is everyone making
such a big deal out of it?

Everyone's gonna know who's
Beethoven in a hundred years,

will they know who Josh Irving
is?

Oh, shit, Josh, I didn't
mean it like that.

Josh!

No, I'm sorry, I meant all of
us.

You are not the person
I thought you were.

Neither are you.

You act like everyone is
abandoning you,

but you're the one who choose
all of this.

You choose to spend your
life in a practice room.

You choose to think that
you're somehow different

so you couldn't have any
friends.

And you choose to think

that you have to be
perfect to have a career.

I don't know what the
thing with your father is,

but at least you have one.

What about your bike?
I'll take the bus!

[traffic whirring]

[Josh screams]
[fist pounds]

[indistinct chattering]

[bus rumbling]

[Josh sighs]

[traffic whirring]

I'd never seen her happier,
hmm.

Mm, you were her whole world.

You were the light of her life,
man.

After you were born, she
didn't need anything.

Not her art, not me.

there.

You don't know what she needed.

I know, and I'm sorry.

You know, this photograph,

this photograph is the thing
that got me painting again.

Deepened my love for art.

Your mom and I had just come
from a little flea market

and I bought her a used
Roller-flex.

And I snapped that on the fly.

And later that night, she told
me she was pregnant with you.

Why are you here?

Why are you suddenly hellbound
on staying?

I had an opportunity, I had to
leave.

I'm not saying it's right,

but it was what I felt I had to
do.

[dramatic music]

But looking back, all the
traveling, all the places,

all the running around, trying
to get the perfect shot,

the perfect sunset.

I would trade all that in a
heartbeat

to get back the moments I
lost with you and your mom.

I didn't know it then, but I do
now.

And I'm gonna prove it to you.

Like tonight, this competition,

whatever happens, I'm
gonna be here for you.

If moving mom away, is what you

and she wants, then
I'll go wherever you go,

'cause it's not about where I am
anymore,

about where you are.

And I'm gonna prove that to you.

If you knew how hard
mom worked all these years

while you were out living it up.

All pompous with your travel log
photos

and drinking wine with
these pretentious idiots

who think you're some kind of
genius!

And then you come here and
pretend

to be interested in what I'm
doing every couple of years.

You have no idea what it's like.

You don't care about me

or my music or about my goals
to move mom away from here.

It's all about you!

Still.

[dramatic music continues]

[door opens]

Hey grandma, shouldn't
you be at the doctors?

I'm back, I'm fine.

I told you.

Where is Zabov?

some groceries to make lunch.

Stubborn old fool.

[dramatic music]

What you did last night-

I know, I'm sorry.

[speaking in foreign language]

What you did was wrong.

You're better than that.

But I take some fault.

I pressed you too hard to win.

No, Grandma, it's not...

I forgot what it's like to be
young.

Have a life of opportunity
in front of you.

In love.

I'm not in love.

You are so head over heels,

you can't walk unless
you're doing a handstand.

I was so worried about your
future.

I could only see that
competition.

It was the love of the music,
not the fame, not the money.

It was always the music.

When I watched you and
Josh up there last night,

a new fire got lit in this
old dusty heart of mine.

Oh, I haven't felt that since-

Grandpa?

No, before.

Do ever regret not taking a
chance?

[door opens]

I'll meet you in the kitchen.

Sometimes, but then I wouldn't
have you or your sister.

[Charlotte chuckles]

You have to figure out
what it is you want,

not what the rest of us want.

Everyone is just trying to
figure out their own shit.

Grandma!

Yes, your grandma
curses on occasion too.

Practice, don't practice.

I'm going to get myself some
lunch.

[bright music]

I would've stayed.

I know.

That's why I left.

[Corinna chuckles]

Hey, package for Josh Irving.

Yeah, that's me.
All right.

Just sign here, please.

You have a good day.
Thanks, you too.

Okay.

[paper tearing]

[dramatic piano music]

[dramatic piano music]

[indistinct chattering]

You, I saw you at the piano
bar.

That was magnificent, young man.

The caliber of your talent is
gonna

put you on the world stage.

I look forward to what your
future holds.

And look at that face, the full
package.

Fabulous.

You're ready.

You're ready.

Confidence.

Saturday is gone, take a deep
breath.

[both inhaling]

Deep breaths.

Now, once you perform, you
come backstage and wait.

The results will be announced
immediately

following the competition.

So Beatrice, you're up.

Good luck. [sighs]
Thanks.

You too.
[Beatrice sighs]

[footsteps tapping]

[bright piano music]

I'm glad to see you've
come to your senses.

Potassium for the nerves,
smart boy.

Victor.
Corinna.

Hmm.

I just wanted to tell
you good luck tonight.

You are a stellar pianist.

And just remember, play from
your heart.

Hmm?

May I help you off?
Certainly.

[bright piano music]

Why do you play, Josh?

I, because...

'Cause why?

Do you love it?

I've taught you everything I
can.

Now it's up to you to
do what's in your heart.

Trust your instincts.

Don't let any moment get away.

[bright piano music continues]

[judge applauding]

[footsteps tapping]

[Josh sighing]

[phone buzzing]

[dramatic piano music]

Now that we got that over
with.

Once upon a time,

a young Beethoven got
to play for his idol,

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,

in the hope that he would
get to study under him.

Uh, the story goes that
Mozart had no interest

in being interrupted by
something

so frivolous and was even colder

when Beethoven played a
studied piece of Mozart's.

Beethoven begged for another
chance.

Mozart played a tune
that the young composer

could never have possibly heard.

Beethoven then went on to
improvise on that tune.

Rumor has it that after
Beethoven played,

Mozart said, "Look out for that
boy.

One day he'll give the world
something to talk about."

Beethoven never went on
to study under Mozart,

but he became beloved all on
his own, doing his own thing.

Now, if you'll indulge me,

I'd like to try my own thing,

inspired by Beethoven and

a few new friends.

For you tonight.

[bright piano music]

[pen scratching]

[paper crinkling]

[pen scratching]

[bag rustling]

[bright piano music continues]

Sorry, Grandma, my heart's not
in it.

But everything will be fine,
promise.

Love you.

[door opens and closes]

[dramatic piano music]

[Josh breathes uneasily]

[soft piano music]

â™ª The storm has abated â™ª

â™ª The sheep are safe to roam â™ª

â™ª Through meadows and fields â™ª

â™ª That the Lord made for our
home â™ª

â™ª His love in abundance â™ª

â™ª Oh, has filled me to the brim â™ª

â™ª And all I can offer â™ª

â™ª Is this humble shepherd's hymn â™ª

â™ª Praise him, praise him, praise
him â™ª

â™ª All of us praise him,
praise him, praise him â™ª

â™ª All of us â™ª

â™ª Sing this shepherd's hymn â™ª

â™ª Ooh â™ª

Alright, everybody,
why don't we take 10.

You sound amazing.

[soft piano music]

I didn't wanna interrupt you.

Just came to see you.

Say I'm sorry.

Okay, well you did.

That's done.

[soft piano music]

Josh.

Josh.
You quit.

And you are still here,
you should be in London.

We handed them out to everyone
in town.

This place is gonna be packed!

You're gonna make so much money.

Charlotte, hey.

Hey.

We're gonna go home and
get our stuff and shower.

Back to rehearse, you
know, in like an hour?

Yeah, yeah, that's perfect.

I'll be done with the choir by
then.

How did you know where to find
me?

The other kids are great
at music, awful with secrets.

It's wonderful what you do
for those kids in the church.

I don't get it.

You got everything you want,
why are you still here?

You don't know what I wanted,
you quit.

I left you a note.

Well, at least you have
it, that's something.

I haven't read it.

I just wanted to tell you that
I...

Ooh, the great Charlotte lost
for words,

Hmm, I guess there's a first
time for everything, huh?

When I was watching you
play, you really loved it.

But I don't feel that.

I feel like when I'm
playing with all the kids.

I feel like when I'm playing
with a gig on the toy piano.

And I feel it with you.

The performance, the
competition, you were amazing.

And my grandma couldn't
stop talking about you.

She told me that the judges
were arguing for hours.

Is it true?

Okay, yes, all right, uh...

I just wanted to say that I'm

I'm sorry for messing up your
life,

for ruining it and

I'm just sorry.

[footsteps tapping]

I didn't care why you
quit the competition.

I cared why you quit on me.

You left after all of that.

And you say you feel all of
that, but you

you walked away.

I know I messed up, but I
can't take it back. [sniffs]

I was alone.

Again.

I didn't stay for you,
because of you or whatever.

I know.

I stayed for me.

This is where I wanna be.

I would just prefer you here

with me.
