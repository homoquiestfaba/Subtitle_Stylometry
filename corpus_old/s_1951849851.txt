AK47,

9-11,
It's bullshit,

Hey!

Oh, oh, oh,

Oh! Oh!

Yo,

Just got off the horn

with the Major,

You're on the next transport

out of Kabul,

Hey, Case,

Is it wrong to pray for revenge?

Fuck do I know?

The T aliban does all day

long, right?

You think God answers

their prayers?

There's a lot of crazy

shit out here,

Look around you, man,

Is this what you want?

Chavez!

Dave?

Yeah,
man it's me, Shit,

how have you been?

Um,

I just got back from Afghanistan,

No shit, man, You got
all your fingers and

toes, too, That's great,

Well come here, fucker,

Gimme a hug,

Yeah, neighborhood's
gotten so bad, man,

I guess I should've moved out with all

the other buddies,

Well, this is a beach front property

you're sitting on here,

And, uh, not too many people will

bug you down here, so,

Yeah, but I need somewhere

to keep my bag,

Sure, It's a free country,

You know what I mean, you fought

for it, You know?

Desert Storm,

Got your medals,

Yeah, I was gonna

join too, man, but,

flat feet,

THC get out of your
system sometimes Golden

Seal just don't work--

Listen, Dave,

I don't wanna be the only guy

in the neighborhood

who doesn't know what happened

to my family,

Well, you see how the neighborhood's

gotten, man,

And you know how Lucia was,

Always righteous,
always with her

head up, man,

After your little boy was born,

You thought she was gonna sit by

and let Juju and the dealers

move in and start dealing rocks

on the corner, man?

She was calling the cops every

night on them,

Someone on the Police force must

have ratted her out,

Who did it?

Who did it, Dave?

Are you talking about the guy

who had the knife,

or the guy who paid him to do it?

You know? 'Cause the
chain of people that

goes between those two,

I mean, that involves half

the neighborhood,

Look, man, I ain't
saying that I don't care,

Gabriel, because I do,

But there is such a
thing as spilled milk, so

whatever you're planning,

I don't want any part of it,

There are some powers to be in

this neighborhood

that you do not want to

fuck with, man,

You just make sure
you get 'em all, Like

fucking cockroaches,

You let any of them get
away, you're gonna have

to start all over again,

You know why the British lost here?

Why the Soviets lost
here, why we're eventually

gonna fucking lose here?

Blood vengeance,
They make a vow

to get your ass,

I'm not talking about a little New

Year's resolution,

I'm talking about they
give up every fucking

thing to get you,

They believe that if their will

is strong enough,

they can come get you from the dead,

I didn't wash Afghanistan off me,

Hey, Dave,
I gotta go wash up,

Yeah, well maybe now
isn't such a good time,

It's Juju's guys,
Pimps and hoes

at your house,

Dave, I gotta go home sometime,

They'll let you use the

bathroom at Paco's,

Excuse me, ma'am,
Is there a rest room

that I can use?

Ma'am? Hm, I like that,

Yeah, you can use
whatever you want it's

the last one on the left,

Can I get you anything?

Uh, coffee, sugar,

Okay,

After your little boy was born,

She wasn't just gonna sit by and

and let Juju and a bunch of dealers

move in and start dealing rocks at

the corner, man?

It's Juju's guys,
Pimps and hoes

at your house,

He's not a very pleasant guy, Trane,

Now I want the

fucking money!

Come here,

Come here,

In the register--

I'm losing my

fucking patience,

I don't have anything,
I gave you what's in

the register

I want the money now,

Why don't you listen to her and

come back later?

Who the fuck are you?

And who the fuck you think you're

talking to, bitch?

That's right,
I called you a

fuckin' bitch, bitch,

You think that's funny, huh? Okay,

Go ahead,

Wipe that silly ass
smile off your fucking

face right now, bitch,

He doesn't know who
you are, He just came

to use the bathroom, Here,

Take this,

Yeah, You afraid to die, bitch? Huh?

Here, Take it,

Hey, bitch, You're lucky,

Are you trying to get me killed?

He works for Juju,

Yo, Rambo! You lost or somethin'?

What the fuck do you want, man?

Get the fuck out now,

I don't say shit twice!

Chilly, you can't be
punching these hoes,

Why?

Don't wanna fuck a broken asshole,

Yeah, maybe so, man,
but Juju's getting fucking

pissed off with this shit,

Just bitch slap 'em,

With my hand?

With an open hand that's why they

call it bitch slapping,

I punch her,

You're not in Colombia

anymore, man,

Juju's pissed off on this shit,

What's wrong with this bitch?

Yo, some army guy--

Get your fucking hands off the truck,

Some army guy just threw us out--

What do you mean some army guy?

A fuckin' army guy is throwing

all the girls out,

Call Juju and later
we'll check this out,

Can I use your phone?

You think I want
your little fucking dirty

scumbag fingers on my phone?

You know what?
Call 'em on a pay

phone, Here,

Get the fuck outta my face, Let's go,

Santa Maria,
forgive me,

Because I have no
forgiveness for the people

who took my family from me,

God knows I'm lost and I'll

pay for my sins,

But I didn't come back
to turn the other cheek,

Yo, army boy,

What's your problem?

Just looking for a good time,

Are both you guys gonna suck my dick

at once or take turns?

Oh, you funny, huh?
Are you like George

Lopez or somethin'?

You're like two seconds
getting fucking blasted,

son, You feel me?

Oh, yeah, I feel you,

Are you feelin' me?

Money first, How about 20 bucks if

you suck my dick?

And there's an extra
tip in it for you if your

tranny friend here swallows,

Man, blow this mother fucker away,

Hey, fag,

Suck this,

Mother fucker, Oh!

Fuck!

These hits will lower your

score, Captain,

Don't forget to use
the available cover,

The fuckin' video game

Okay, okay,

Let's try it again,

Okay,

with you when I was a child,

What?

Hey, it's Zoe, Some army guy just threw

us out of the house,

I hear gun shots,

I'm taking care of this, alright?

You run there with the boys,

and don't bother bringing him alive,

Just waste 'em, Okay?

Everything's gonna be alright,

Drive slow, alright?

I know how to--

If the car gets dirty,
bring it here to Paquito,

He'll do the cleaning,

Fucking tellin' me how
to drive a fuckin' car,

Slow down,

Just slow down,

Is this slow enough?

Is this slow enough?

Can't be my fucking neighbor,

Hey, Dave, Where does Juju live?

Uh, 110th St, housing

projects, Why?

I just like to know where I'm goin',

What's goin' on?

Oh, son of a bitch, You brought

Don't shoot,

Don't shoot,
Don't shoot,

I'll give you whatever you want,

You the man in charge?

Who's in charge?

I'm not the man in charge,

The Russians run everything,

What Russians?

The Russians in Brighton,

Bullshit,

Hey, wait, wait, wait,

Wait, I don't have no weapons, okay?

You wanna take over my business, I can

totally relate to that,

but you gotta talk to them,

because if I die,

they'll come down on your ass

and that's a battle
you cannot win, huh?

I wanna meet them,

I can arrange that,

Now,

Look, this is T rane,

T rane, this is lvan,

He's a cop?

No,

Hm,

I have something for you,

What?

50 pounds of heroin,

How much?

It's a gift,

How come I didn't get no gift?

Sit down,

You served?

Afghanistan,

Hm, Me, too,

I wanna do business with you, Ivan,

This smack is to show you that I'm

on the level,

We already have a supplier in there,

Who? T errorists?,
Warlords?

I get my shit directly
from the NATO impound

and I get a lot of it,

I have to discuss it with Sergei,

Sergei?

I thought you were the one

calling the shots,

As far as you're concerned,

I call the shots,

Don't hurt our new friend, Juju,

He's a war hero, you know,

Maybe you can show him

a good time,

Trane, give us a minute, okay?

If he has any heroin, find it

and kill him,

What the hell are you doing?

I'm taking them all down,

You want some advice?

Just get outta here,
There ain't nothing

left for you here,

Go back to Afghanistan, kill

some Saudis, whatever,

'Cause you're turning this place

into a war zone,

It already is a war zone, Dave,

Hey, Caridad,

If you don't mind,

No problem,

Good to see you, honey,

Hey, look who's coming,

The most beautiful woman in the world,

My pride and joy,

Caridad, I want you to meet my

new friend, T rencito,

Plenty of time,

Enjoy your piece of
the pie and everything

Juju's present,

My office is waiting

No problem,

Y eah, I could, too,

Holy mackerel,

Maybe we could go someplace

more private?

Okay,

Thanks again for the car,

Ha, ha, ha,

I hope you like genital warts,

That bitch got a crab,

shrimp, lobster,

the whole seafood planet in that ass,

Not that I know of, you

heard on the streets,

You know what I'm saying?

What you looking at?

I'm looking at you,

Uh, I like to watch,

So just lay back and do your thing,

But I don't like anybody to see me,

Okay?

Okay,

gonna do this on faith,

We gotta get paid upfront, comprende?

Make sure you find
out where he's keepin'

the heroin, alright?

How we gonna do that if we kill 'em?

Find it out before you kill him,

Where is this fuckin' spic?

What do you think you're doing?

You don't fuck with someone like Juju,

How do you think that's funny?

He's sending his boys
over here right now,

Did you tell 'em you're my sister?

I'm not stupid,

I'm just trying to help

you, Gabriel,

I'm not a little girl anymore,

Yeah,

I can see that,

What was I supposed to do?

Juju protects me,

Okay, Fine,

I'm the screw up,

I don't wanna see you get hurt,

Just stay out of my way,

Why don't we take a break?
We'll go get a freebie

from one of Juju's girls,

Tommy,

what the fuck is wrong with you?

I know this may sound weird to you,

every once in a while
we actually gotta do

our job, you know?

It ain't all about booze and whores,

Alright, You're right, I'm sorry,

Were you boys looking

for some smack?

We might be,
How much you got?

A lot,

Where is it?

I tell you where it
is, then you kill me,

I don't think so,

Oh, Come on, man,

What do you think this is?

We're cops,
You think we're

gonna kill ya?

We ain't gonna kill ya, Come on, get in

the back of the car,

Take us to it,

Come on, we'll give
you a beer, Come on,

Take a small ride,

You got our word,

Okay,

I live near Brighton beach,

Good, Have a beer,

So, Trane,

How come you guys couldn't

get Bin Laden?

We needed more guys,

You needed more guys?

Should've, could've,
would've, Hm?

Maybe you two could
teach me a little something

about honor and duty,

Honor and duty, huh?

You keep those fucking words

out of your mouth,

I'm about 10 seconds from dumping

your ass in the guano,

Wait until we get this shit,

He's diggin' all day,

Go finish your fucking
donut, You threw it on

the ground over there,

I found it,

Get the fuck out,
Move! Move!

Where is it?
You got it?

I don't see anything,
What's he talking about?

Hey, Trane, where is it?
I don't see anything,

Hey!

You son of a bitch,

Shit,

Shit,

Jesus,

Ritchie,

Richie,

Aw, Jesus,

AIright, Where's my drugs?

You didn't get it?

No, Of course

I didn't get it,

I gave it to Juju's boys,

Blitzer and McKern,

No better bag man than the NYPD,

How come you didn't bring it?

I'm not gonna walk down the street

with 50 pounds of smack,

Smart,

How you getting along with Juju?

He said you had
trouble with the police,

That's bullshit,

He said when the cops
take you down he'd be

happy to buy my shipments,

Juju's a snake,
I'll prove it to

you tomorrow,

Fuck,

I'm the daddy here,

Let's make a toast,

T o T rane, Huh?

May he rot in fucking hell,

That's a good toast,

You girls celebrating something?

What's the occasion?

Why wasn't I invited?

I thought you'd be busy,

I was busy,

I ran into your boys,
Blitzer and McKern,

They seemed pretty
interested in my heroin,

What about you?

You wanna buy it?

Yes,

Half a million,

Or I could just give it to lvan,

I'll buy it,

You know the air strip
at Floyd Bennett?

Yes? No?

Tomorrow, 11:00 AM,

When do I get to meet Sergei?

You don't need to meet him,

you deal with me,

I cannot believe

that Juju thinks he can steal my drugs,

Juju must be the dumbest mother

fucker on the planet,

Don't touch it,

What is it?

That's where we melt down the bodies,

This will be Juju's new home,

We going golfing?

Where is he gonna be?

Right over here in the middle of

this runway,

Oh, No it's bad for me,

They're gonna come from the entrance

road on the right,

Actually,

I don't like killing with a gun,

It saves a

Iot of the mess,

You know,
gun takes the

fun out of it,

I prefer with a knife,

Up close, in person,

AIthough Sergei tells me who to kill,

but how to kill is my business,

Can't wait to meet this guy,

Car's approaching,

There she is,

Fuck,

Shit,

You gotta find that girl,
Okay? Bring in the girl,

We have his girl at the safe house,

The safe house,

Girl, girl, girl,
Get me the phone,

Alright,
Alright,

Alright,

Hey, man,
you've reached

Juju's voice mail,

Unfortunately, he is unable to take

your call,

But if you leave him
a message, probably, he

might get back to you,

Parlamo italiano,
se habla espanol,

J uju, if you wanna see

your girl again,

bring me the

fucking heroin!

If Juju wants her back he's gonna try

to take her by force,

Then we'll kill her,

How many guys do you have watching her?

Three,

That's it?

What? Is that enough?,

Yuri, go check up on them, with him,

Please,

Hey, Yuri, Why don't
you go down to the corner

and get us some coffee?

It's gonna be a long night,

Oh, I get coffee,
Okay, Sounds good,

Yuri went back to lvan's,

Where's the girl?

Juju isn't gonna be around to protect

you anymore, Please,

without him coming,

I'm not leaving until I finish this,

Finish what?

Or set each other up, or anything,

Man, I just want you to tell me

where my wife is,

Then I'll let you go,

And you can crawl back to

Afghanistan

or to whatever other shit hole

you came from,

How's that sound, bro?

Why don't you go fuck yourself?

He just cursed at you,

Do it, you fuckin' pussy,

He just called you a pussy,

man, Do it,

Stab 'em already

I'm cutting you piece by
piece and the only thing I'm

gonna leave is your tongue,

'Cause you're gonna be begging

to tell me--

Why don't you stop talking and

just do it, you fagot,

Do it, Stab 'em already,

You heard 'em,
fuckin' do it, man,

He's asking you,

What the fuck is wrong with

you? Shut up! Huh?,

I'm about to carve your eyes out,

So do it already!

She's my wife,

Pussy,

That's juicy, right?

Talk already, Talk!

I told you I wasn't lying,

T ell me where she is,

Stab his other eye, already,

Oh, man, Look at his fucking eyeballs,

You can't see his eyeballs,

You're making people sick, Here,

He's vomiting because
of your fucking eyes,

There you go,

The fucker's puking' because of you,

Come on, man, this is embarrassing,

You're puking like a little girl,

He doesn't know shit,

He knows, man,
He fucking knows,

Fuck you,
He doesn't

I just poked his eyes out,

But now I say we get serious

He cannot be gone,

He's gone, dude,

He's around here somewhere,

Hurry up, he's not gonna go too far,

You wanna make me go into the jungle

Where the hell did he go, man?

The mother fucker,

You never know with these guys in

the military, you know,

Hope there's no snakes, man,

He cannot go too far,

He's blind,

There'd better be no fuckin'

snakes in here,

Promise me one thing,

Is it wrong to pray for revenge?

Fuck do I know?

Look around you, man,
Is this what you want?

Send me back,

Dave!

Dave!

Gabriel!

Are you okay?

One more time,

Right,

We're there,
Back up,

Dave,

Can you make a phone call for me?

You know where I buried my bag?

What do you need your bag for?

I need to get to Sergei's,

No, dude, You need to
get to a hospital, man,

Just give me my bag,

Please,

Towel,

Ivan, It's me, Trane,

You went for them, huh?

Yeah, But I got Juju and Antwan

coming to kill me,

Okay, Antwan,

Stay put, here,

Try not to touch anything,

Keep your eyes on the road,

You've said it once,
I heard you, Okay,

Keep your eyes on the road in

case the cops come,

Alright?

"Don't touch anything--

You said it three--
The first time I heard

you it was fucking fine,

The third time was too fucking much,

Come on! Damn it,

"Don't touch-- The fucking thing's

broken, It's broken,

"Don't touch anything,"

"Don't touch it, "

Gabriel!

Above!

The man's just above,

Come on, man,

Pick up the phone,

Juju, Pick it up,

Oh!

If you leave a message,

probably, he might get back to you,

Oh!

Oh! Whoa,

Hold it, man,

Whoa, whoa,
Hey, I'm right here,

I'm right here, Listen!

Relax, man,
I'm married

to your sister,

That has to mean something,

for Christ's sakes,

Maybe next lifetime,

Yo!

Yo,

Jesus Christ, man,

I'm fine,

[Don't fucking move!

Where's Juju?

He's dead,
Where's Antwan?

I blew his fucking head off, What

happened to your face?

Let's get 'em over to lvan's,

Ivan,

Trane, You got the smack?

Yeah,

Good,

Good,

Throw your bag in the trunk,

You know, I don't want to

sound sentimental,

It's funny,

You and I were both soldiers

before in Afghanistan,

And now we're here, another

war zone, Rockaway,

where you have to kill to survive

kill to win,
kill to stay strong,

I never enjoyed killing,

I used to be like you,

Until it all changes,
in Afghanistan,

We got an order,
we had to wipe out

the whole village,

There was-- there was some

terrorists, I don't know,

We couldn't leave any witnesses,

So I came inside of some house,

and there was a girl,
she was 14, 1 5, 1 6,

I don't know,

She spoke Russian, she knew

she was gonna die,

And she said,
"l don't want to

die as a virgin,"

So she didn't die as a virgin,

And after that,
it's all the same,

There's nothing left of me here,

There's nothing left,

Where's my present?

What's that?

That's it?

No,

Just let me go back,

Just got off the

phone with the Major,

You're on the next

transport out of Kabul,

Just let me go back,

Just let me go back,

Send me back,

Send me back,

I actually

never like to kill with a gun,

I prefer a knife,

Is it wrong to

pray for revenge?

Look around you,

Is this what you want?

Hold on, Jose,
Y o, Rambo!

You lost or something?

Yeah, man, Get out
of here, Go sell your

boy scout cookies,

Yo, make sure you shake it before you

get into my car,

Like I was tellin' ya, I don't wanna

go over there

and have to smack your
bitches up, you hear me?

You know what, Antwan?

What?

Be careful with my baby, I just

had her detailed,

Alright?

Yeah,

You know what?

I don't want you eating

inside the car, Huh?

That wasn't me

there eating--

No scratches to the paint,

I heard,
Yes, Yes,

If you're gonna park,

try not to do dings to my rims,

Alright?

No dings to my rims,

Yes, Master,

Yeah, Anything else?

What happened to your car?

You never told me,

That wasn't me, man, It was

some Jersey driver

that got in the fucking way,

but I'm cool,

Come on,

Ah!

Gracias, It's a lot of cabbage,

What do you say?
Lunch is on me,

It's good,

It's good, Hey,
uh, Juju, you know,

I sing a little bit,

Uh, we should get together

and jam sometime,

This is nice,
we could cut

a little demo,

Who knows?
I'm just saying--

You'll cut a Christmas album,

We're having lunch,
