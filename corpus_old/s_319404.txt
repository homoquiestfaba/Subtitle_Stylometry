Will. Why is this happening?

I don't know.  You look beautiful.

I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.

Make way. Let me through!  How dare you!

Stand your men down at once! Do you hear me?

Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long.

Cutler Beckett?

It's Lord now. Actually.

Lord or not, you have no reason and no authority to arrest this man.

In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.

This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann!

Oh, is it? That's annoying, my mistake...  Arrest her.

On what charges?!
No!

Aha, here's the one for William Turner.  And I have another one for a Mr. James Norrington. Is he present?

What are the charges?

Commodore Norrington resigned his commission some months ago.

I don't believe that was the answer to the question I asked.

Lord Beckett, in the category of questions not answered -

We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal and you will tell us what we are charged with.

The charge... is conspiring to set free a man convicted of crimes against the Crown and Empire

and condemned to death for which the...

For which the punishment, regrettably, is also death.

Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.

Captain!

Captain Jack Sparrow.

Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might.

50 men on a dead man's chest.

Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

Drink and the devil had done (??) for the rest.

Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

Sorry, mate.

Do you mind if we make a little side trip?

I didn't think so.

Not quite according to plan.

Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.

You got what you went in for, then?

Muhuh.

Captain, I think the crew - meaning me, as well -

were expecting something a bit more...  shiny.

What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear-shapes, reclaimed by the sea and the treasure with it.

And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic.

And the hurricane!

All in all, it seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.

Shiny?

Aye, shiny.

Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear ol' Jack is not serving your best interests as Captain?

Awk, walk the plank.

What did the bird say?!

Do not blame the bird. Show us, what is on that piece of cloth there.

You know that don't do no good.

It does me.

It's a key.

No, much more better! It is a drawing of a key.

Gentlemen, what do keys do?

Keys... unlock things?

And whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable.

So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!

No. We don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks.

So, what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have,

without first having found the key what unlocks it.

So, we're going after this key!

You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions?

So... Do we have a heading?

Ah!  A heading.

Set sail in a...

general...

that way direction!

Captain?

Come on. Snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Oi, oi!

I've notice lately,

the Captain seem to be acting a bit strange...er.

Setting sail without knowing his own heading,

something's got Jack vexed. You mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow, bodes ill for us all.

Lord Beckett, the prisoner as ordered, sir.

Those won't be necessary.

The East India Trading Company has need of your services.

We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend - Captain Sparrow.

More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him?

We've had dealings in the past.

And we've each left our mark on the other.

What mark did he leave on you?

By your efforts, Jack Sparrow was set free.

I would like you to go to him and recover a certain property in his possession.

Recover. At the point of a sword?

Bargain.

Letters of Marque.

You will offer what amounts to a full pardon - Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.

Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.

Freedom.

Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

The world is shrinking. The blank edges of the map filled in.

Jack must find his place in the New World or perish.

Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

You and your fianc? face the hangman's noose.

So you get both Jack and the Black Pearl.

The Black Pearl?

The property you want that he possesses.

A ship? Hardly.

The item in question is considerably smaller and far more valuable.

??

a compass?

Ah, you know it.

Bring back that compass, or there's no deal.

Why is the rum always gone?

Oh... that's why.

Time's run out, Jack.

Bootstrap. Bill Turner?

You look good, Jack.

Is this a dream?

No.

I thought not, if it were, there'd be rum.

You got the Pearl back, I see.

I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way.

Your son.

William?

Ended up pirate after all.

And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?

He sent me.

Davy Jones.

Ah. So it's you, then.

He shanghaied you into service, eh?

I chose it.

I'm sorry for the part I played in the mutiny against you, Jack.

I stood up for ya.

Everything went wrong after that.

They strapped me to a cannon, I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

the weight of the water crushing down on me.

Unable to move,

unable to die, Jack,

and I thought that even the tiniest hope of escaping this fate, I would take it.

I would trade anything for it.

It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment.

You made a deal with him, too, Jack.

He raised the Pearl from the depths for you, thirteen years you've been Captain.

Technically, I -

Jack. Won't be able to talk yourself out of this.

The terms would apply to me, apply to you, as well.

One soul, bound to crew a hundred years upon his ship.

Yes, but The Flying Dutchman already has a Captain, so there's really -

Then it's the Locker for you!

Though this is terrible, the leviathan will find you

and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it.

Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?

I already told you, Jack.

The time is up.

It comes now.(??)

the black spot.

On deck all hands! Make faster -- gasket! On deck! Scurry!

Scurry on! Move it! Move it!! I want movement!

Mr. Skinner, pick it up! (??)

I want a --- (??), plenty running.

Run as if the devil himself and itself was upon us!

Do we have a heading?

Ah!

Rum! Land.

Ah!

Which port?

I didn't say port. I said land, any land.  Ah!

Jack's hat! Steer about!

No, no, leave it.

Rum.

Back to your stations, the lot of ya!

Jack?

Shh!

For the love of Mother and Child, Jack, what's coming after us?

Nothing.

You're not... you can't be here.

I think you'll find he can.

Mr. Swann.

Governor Swann, still. Do you think I wear this wig to keep my head warm?

Jack's compass? What does Beckett want with that?

Doesn't matter. I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal and in exchange the charges against us will be dropped.

No, we must find our own avenue to secure your freedom.

Is that a lack of faith in Jack... or in me?

You would risk your life to save Sparrow's does not mean that he would do the same for anyone else.

Now,

where's that dog with the keys?

I have faith in you. Both of you.

Where will you find him?

Tortuga.

I'll start there and I won't stop searching 'till I find him.

And then I intend to return here to marry you.

Properly?

With your leave, if you'll still have me.

If it weren't for these bars, I'd have you already.

I'll wait for you.

Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

Captain Jack Sparrow?

Hadn't been thought about,

heard he was dead.

Singapore, that's what I heard. Drunk, with a smile on his face.

Sure as a tide, Jack Sparrow,

turned up in Singapore.

Jack Sparrow?

I haven't seen him in a month.

When you find him, you give him a message.

Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

but this island just south of the straits where I trade spice for...

delicious,long pork.

Cannot say about Jack. But you'll find that ship there.

A ship with black sails.

My brother will take you ashore.

What's wrong, the beach is right there?

Ne bougeais pas, c'set beaucoup trop dangereaux.

What?

Je ne pois, c'est trop dangereaux, j'avais le dit.  Bon voyage, monsieur.

Bon voyage, monsieur.

Jack! Jack Sparrow!

Marty!

Cotton!

Anybody?

Ah, a familiar face.

Awk, don't eat me!

I'm not going to eat you.

Don't eat me. Don't eat me. Awk!

Gibbs.

Come on! Let's go!

Come on!!

who wants it?!

I can do this all day!

Jack? Jack Sparrow.

I can honestly say I'm glad to see you.

Jack, it's me, Will Turner!

Tell them to let me down.

Jack, the compass, that's all I need. Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for trying to help you.

She faces the gallows!

Maliki liki! Maliki liki!(??????)

Save me.

Jack, what did you tell them? No!

What about Elizabeth?

Jaaack!

Come quickly.

You've got to tell me what's happening.

I may still have some standing in the keep. I've arranged passage to England. The Captain is a friend of mine.

No! Will's gone to find Jack!

We cannot count on William Turner. Come!

He's a better man than you give him credit for.

Of course, this is no time for innocence. Beckett has offered one pardon only. One!

And that is promised to Jack Sparrow. Even if Will succeeds...

you're not asking me to endure the sight of my daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

Perhaps, I can ensure a fair trial for Will, if he returns.

A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.

Then there is nothing left for you here.

Wait inside.

Captain?

Captain..

Evening, Gov'ner.  Shame, huh?

He was carrying this  It's a letter to the King.

It's from you.

Ah...  Elizabeth.

What are you doing?!

Where is she?

Who?

No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm as your father believes.

Then what is?

I'm afraid currency is the currency of the realm.

I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding.

I'm here to negotiate.

I'm listening.

I'm listening intently.

These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?

Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.

Or else I would not still be here.

You sent Will to get you the compass and buy Jack Sparrow,

it will do you no good.

Do explain.

I have been to the Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself.

There is something you need to know.

Aah, I see.

You think the compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta and so you hope to save me from an evil fate.

But you mustn't worry.

I care not for cursed Aztec gold, my desires are not so provincial.

There's more than one chest of value in these waters.

So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer.

Consider it in your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.

So I did.

A marriage interrupted.

Or fate intervenes.

You're making great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

These are not going to Jack.

Oh, really. To insure Mr. Turner's freedom?

I'll still want that compass. Consider that in your calculations.

Well, I say it was divine providence what escaped us from jail.

And I'll say, it was me being clever. Ain't that right, poochy?

Well, how d'you know it weren't divine providence what inspired you to be clever.

Anyways, I'm no' stealing no ship.

It ain't stealing, it's salvaging. And since when did you care?

Since we're not immortal no more. We've got to take care of our immortal souls.

You know you can't read.

It's the Bible, you get credit for trying.

Pretending to read the Bible's a laugh! That's a mark against the...

Look.  There it is.

It's gonna swim?

Must've seen a catfish.

Stupid mongrel!

Come on!

It's ours for the taking!

Tide's coming in, that should help. Salvaging is saving, in a manner of speaking.

There's the truth of it!

Suppose we'd better save it as soon as we can. What with us in such a vulnerable state, y'know?

Amen to that.

Thank you.

Why would he do this to us? If Jack is the chief -

Aye. The Pelegostos have made Jack their chief. But he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief.

So he had no choice. He's a captive there as much as the rest of us.

Worse, as it turns out. You see, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a god in human form.

And they intend to do 'im the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

They'll roast him and eat him.

Where's the rest of the crew?

These cages we're in weren't built 'till after we got here.

The feast is about to begin. Jack's life will end...

when the drums stop.

Well, we can't just sit here and wait then, can we?

No! No no. Oi, no no! More wood.

Big fire. Big fire! I am chief, want big fire!

C'mon then.

More wood.

Oh, bugger.

A little seasoning, aye?

Well done.

Put your legs through! Start the climb!

Come on men, it'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!

Actually, you wouldn't need everyone. About six would do.

Oooh, dear.

Hurry!

Heave! Is that all you've got?

Stop, stop. Stop!

What are you doning? Stop!

Snake!

Move!

Fire! fire!

Well, go on, go get them! Helalla!

Helalla! No no, oi! No no.

Not good.

Pull it loose, find a rock!

Roll the cage!

Lift the cage!

Hurry!

Lift it high like a lady's skirt.

This way lads.

Stop it!

Pull loose the mooring line. The mooring line!

Hey! Little hairy thing. Give it back!  Don't bite it!

Pull loose the mooring line!

It's got me eye. It won't give it back.

Well, how'd you get it back last time?

Excellent! Our work's half done!

We done it for you! Knew you'd be coming back for it.

Make ready to sail, boys!

What about Jack? I won't leave without him.

Oi!

Time to go.

Cast off those lines!

Make ready to cast off!

Oi! Good doggy.

Hurry up!!!

Alas, my children, this is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost

Captain Jack Sparrow.

Let's put some distance between us and this island and head out to open sea.

Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only as so far as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.

Now, that seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs. Now, where is that monkey? I want to shoot something.

Jack.

Ah.

Elizabeth is in danger.

Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on her. Maybe just lock her up somewhere?

She is locked up in a prison, bound to hang for helping you.

There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.

I need that compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom.

Mr. Gibbs?

Captain?

We have a need to travel upriver.

By need, do you, mean a trifling need, fleeting, as in, say, a passing fancy?

No, a resolute and unyielding need.

What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

William... I shall trade you the compass, if you will help me...

to find this.

You want me to find this.

No. You want you to find this.

Because the finding of this, finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle ol' what's her face.

Savvy?

This is going to save Elizabeth.

How much do you know about Davy Jones?

Not much.

Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

What's all this?

If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share and wear it one after the other.

It's not like that, sir. This ship is haunted.

Is it now?  You?

There is a female presence amongst us here, sir.

All the men, they can feel it.

Belongs to a lady widowed before her marriage, I figure it.

Searching for her husband lost the sea.

Virgin, too, likely as not.  And that bodes ill by all accounts.

I say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit follows it.

No! That will just anger this spirit, sir.

What we need to do is to find out what the spirit needs and then just get it back to her

Enough! Enough!

You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of ye.

Now this appears to be as no more that we have a stowaway on board.

A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find her.

Oh, and, eh, she's probably naked.

Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones.

A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off

and drag an entire ship down to the crushing darkness.

The Kraken.

They say the stench of its breath is... ooh.

Imagine, the last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses.

If you believe such things.

And the key will spare him that?

Now that's the very question Jack wants answered.

Bad enough even to go visit...

her.

Her?

Aye.

No worries, mates.

Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves.

Nigh inseparable we are.

Were... Have been. Before.

I'll watch your back.

It's me front I'm worried about.

Mind the boat.

Mind the boat.

Mind the boat.

Mind the boat.

Mind the boat.

Mind the boat.

Jack Sparrow.

Tia Dalma.

I always knowed the wind was going to blow you back to me one day.

You...

You have a touch a' destiny about you.

William. Turner.

You know me?

You want to know me.

There'll be no knowing here.  We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.

I thought I knew you.

Not so well as I'd hoped. Come.

Come.

What service may I do ya?

You know I demand payment.

I brought payment.

Look...  an undead monkey. Top that!

No.  You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.

The payment is fair.

We're looking for this.

And what it goes to.

The compass you bartered from me, it cannot lead you to this?

Maybe. Why?

Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.

Or do you know but are loath to claim it as your own.

Your key go to a chest. And it is what lay inside the chest you seek. Don't it?

What is inside?

Gold? Jewels? Unclaimed properties of valuable nature?

Nothing bad, I hope.

You know of Davy Jones, yes?

A man of the sea.

A great sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vex all men.

What vexes all men?

What indeed.

The sea?

Sums.

The dichotomy of good and evil.

A woman!

A woman. He fell in love.

No no no no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

Same story, different version and all are true.

See it was a woman as changing, and harsh and untamable as the sea.

He never stopped loving her.

But the pain it caused him was too much to live with.

But not enough to cause him to die.

What exactly did he put into the chest?

Him heart.

Literally or figuratively?

He couldn't live, putting his heart in a chest.

Could he?

It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings. And so,

him carved out him heart, lock it down in a chest, and hide the chest from the world.

The key he keep with him at all times.

You knew this.

I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do.

So, all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, aye?

Let me see your hand.

The black spot! The black spot.

Black spot.

My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.

Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years.

Land is where you will be safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you will carry land with you.

Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.

Yes.

Is the... jar of dirt going to help?

If you don't want it, give it back.

No.

Then it helps.

It seems... we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.

A touch...  of destiny.

That's the Flying Dutchman?

She doesn't look like much.

Neither do you... do not underestimate it.

Must've run afoul of the reef.

What's your plan?

I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.

And if there are crewmen?

I cut down anyone in my path.

I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

Your chariot awaits you. Ahahaha!

Go on your whereabouts and pray.

Get back! Back!

Five men still alive, the rest have moved on.

Do you fear death?

Do you fear that dark abyss?

All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished.

I can offer you an escape.

Don't listen to him!

Do you not fear death?

I'll take my chances, sir.

To the depths.

Cold blood!

Life is cruel. Why should the afterlife be any different? I offer you a choice.

Join my crew and postpone the judgment.

One hundred years before the mast.

Will ye serve?

I-I-I will serve.

That-a.

You are neither dead nor dying. What is your purpose here?

Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.

What is your purpose here?

Jack Sparrow... sent me to settle his debt.

Ha. Did he now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

You have a debt to pay. You've been Captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement.

Technically, I was only Captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.

Then you were a poor Captain, but a Captain nonetheless. Have you not introduced yourself

all these years as 'Captain Jack Sparrow'?

Yeah, I gave you payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.

One soul is not equal to another.

Aha! So we've establish my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price.

Price?

Just how many souls, do you think, my soul is worth?

One hundred souls. Three days.

You're a darling, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off.

I keep the boy, a good, faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine to go. Haha, haha.

Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, a terrific soprano. Worth at least four,

maybe three and a half..And did I happen to mention...

he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed.

Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?

I keep the boy. Ninty-nine souls-ah.

But I wonder, Sparrow...

can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend - to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?

Yep. I'm good with it. Shall we seal it in blood, I mean, uh, ink?

Three days-ah.

Three days.

Uh, Mr. Gibbs?

Aye.

I feel sullied and unusual.

And how do we intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days?

Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.

Aah, Tortuga.

Tortuga.

It's an outrage. Port Tariff's buried (??) in fees, war handling and, heaven help us, pilotage.

Are we all to work for these India Trading Company, then?

I'm afraid, sir... Tortuga is the only free post left in these waters.

A pirate port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry, an honest sailor is what I am and make my living fair and I sleep well each night, thank you.

Sir!

She wants you to do something.

She's trying to give a sign.

Look, there! There it is! There's the sign.

I seen it.

So we can be saved. Looks like entrails.

That'd be a bad sign.

What's that over there?

And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?

Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young.

You'll do. Make your mark.  Next!

My wife run off with my dog, and I'm drunk for a month, and I don't give an ass rat's if I live or die.

Perfect! Next!

Me have one arm and a bum leg.

It's the crow's nest for you.

I know what I want.

Next!

Ever since I was little, I've always wanted to sail the seas. Forever.

Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.

Thanks very much.

How are we going?

Including those four? That gives us... four.

And what's your story?

My story?

It's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind.

I chased a man across the seven seas. (??)and my life.

Commodore?

No, not anymore, weren't you listening?

I nearly had you all off Tripoli. I would've, if not for the hurricane.

Lord. You didn't try to sail through it?

So do I make your crew or not?

You haven't said where you're going.

Somewhere nice!

So am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?

Or should I just kill you now?

You're hired.

Sorry. Old habits and all that.

Easy sailor!

Time to go.

Aye.

Thanks, mate.

Carry on.

Come on, then! Who wants some? For my lordly line, I'll have you one by one. Come on, who's first?

I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself.

James Norrington.  What has the world done to you?

Heave! Heave! Heave!

Secure the mast, man called Mr. Turner.

Secure it!

Step aside!
mind yourself!

Hey! Let go, boy!

Haul that weasel to his feet.

Five lashes are in my due. To stay honor.

No.

Impeding me in my duties? You'll share the punishment.

I'll take it all.

Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity?

My son.

He's my son.

What fortuitous circumstance be this. Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

No. No, I won't!

The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it at the Bo'sun's hand or your own.

No.

Bo'sun!
No!

You've had it easy boy.

Will!

I don't need your help.

The Bo'sun prides himself on cleaving flesh from bone with every swing.

So I'm to understand what you did was an act of compassion.

Yes.

One hundred years before the mast. Loosing who you are, bit by bit.
'Till you end up, end up like poor, Wyvern, here.

Once you've sworn an oath to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it. 
Not until your debt is paid.

I've sworn no oath.

Then you must get away.

Not until I find this.

The key.

The Dead Man's Chest.

What do you know of it?

Open the chest with the key and stab the heart. No, don't stab the heart.

The Dutchman needs a living heart or there'll be no captain. If there's no captain, there's no one to have the key.

So the Captain has the key.

Where is the key?

Hidden.

Where is the chest.

Hidden.

Captain Sparrow?

Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.

I'm here to find the man I love.

I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.

Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.

Elizabeth?  Hide the rum.

You know these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.

Jack.

I know Will came to find you, where is he?

Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.
