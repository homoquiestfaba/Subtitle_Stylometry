Sick, killed, or injured?

No. No, he's just stoned.

Okay to book, charges?

Homicide.

All right.

Um, doesn't look great,
he'll be up for a while.

Put him to the process, then
we'll get him over to county.

Intercom: Next inmate, window 3.

Gentlemen, let's pump it up.

Keep the line moving.

Crash is ready for pick up.

Bring him in the K-11.
Johnson's here for pick up.

Police radio: Ninety six
days with the doctor.

Give me a few minutes.

I'll wait.

Allergies.

I don't like this.

Next inmate, window 7.

That's Saxx, Raymond.

Homicide 187.

Transferred over
from Beverly Hills.

Can't even question him
until he sobers up.

Beverly Hills.

Can we, uh, rush him through
classification for you?

Get him out of here?

Sweet dreams, sunshine.

Oh, oh.

Hi.

I'm the Butterfly, supreme
symbol of change, silly.

Jeez, are you okay?

I need to fix...

I know.

Please, can you help me?

Mmm, uh-uh.

No, I can't help
you right now.

We're going to be
here all weekend.

Oh, but why is it so
fucking cold in here?

This will help.

What the fuck is K-11?

Well, if they kill
you on the mainline,

You get to go at K-11.

I like to think it's a
sanctuary for broken toys.

You know, a
away from home.

I wanna go home.

Not me.

I'm fucking dying.

Oh, Mark and Junior said to
tell you, that they will be

Back in next Thursday and
that they will have the kind.

Today, already!

Oh, no, you didn't!

You dare rush me?

You must be out of your
damn mind rushing me like, oh.

Whoo! This is
not my fault.

Your man, Johnson,
he'd never picked me up.

Wait around for a rookie.

Oh, what the fuck?

Yeah and I waited
the whole morning.

He fucked up, man!

I could've gotten pinched.

All right, man,
you're off the hook.

Fuck it.

Count time.

K-11, 10 minutes
to count time.

This rumor is just
excessively cruel.

I mean, chili sauce that is
so hot, you can actually burn

Away cancer cells.

The American Medical...

Show is over.

Walking!

I'll take it from
here, lieutenant.

Don't get distracted
by the females in here.

There aren't any
females in here.

If you touch one of them and
your dick is gonna fall off.

Relax, Harris.

Every rookie does at
least four weeks here.

Most of them survive.

Let's do this.

Let's do it down here.

Harris, take the other aisle.

K-11, face down
and your arms out.

No talking.

Hey, come on,
face down, arms out.

I don't wanna touch you.

Yes, I'm sorry,
sir. Just napping.

Intercomm: Crowds

She'll want
these in red.

I like the
leather stripes.

Hold your horses!

[Knock on the door]

You almost
blew it, man!

You have to be
more careful.

And what the hell
are you talking about?

You're a bust.

I'll have
some of that.

But... no, you won't. I already
gave you a fold this morning.

Where did it go?

I bought someone.

Oh, great.

Great, great and
Precious almost got busted.

And you can't follow
a simple direction.

No, maybe it's time
that, uh, I cut your back.

Oh, no, no.

You can't do that.

Oh, yeah. I can.

All right, look. You're getting
sloppy and sloppy is dangerous.

I think you're forgetting
mister that I'm the one who's

In charge here not you.

I could have you
declassified right now

And take all your drugs.

What do you think of that?

I can have you
tested right now.

And your piss is toxic.

All right, so if
I lose, you lose.

Know this.

Last night, you
fainted and hit your head.

I got scared because you bled.

So, I cleaned you up
and wrapped you up

And kept you
warm instead.

You've been asleep
for a quite some time.

You should just try to relax.

I promise to take care of you.

What's your name?

Raymond Saxx.

Relax, Mr. Saxx.

I have been taking care
of people for a long time.

I'm here because I
took care of my daddy.

Bad things come to bad people.

So, I think you'll be fine.

Here, you need to
change, hurry up.

Ian, I-I don't understand.

Come on, you don't
wanna walk out here

Dressed like that, do you?

What?

You've got a bunk in the dorm.

Come on, get that crap off.

I... I just...

Yeah, whatever,
just get dressed.

Oh, and Bobby.

Your paperwork, uh,
misfiled but you'll be

Back in your
bunk soon.

Okay.

Let's go!

Keep movin'.

Face the wall.

You'd never survive
in general population.

They'd put hands on you.
I'll keep you safe.

Gerald Is there a
problem out here?

No, ma'am.

Then give me the
boy's paperwork.

Mr. Saxx, you're
in bunk 36 Low.

You understand?

Okay, then.

Gerald!

What is wrong with you?

You know that you can't
be in there by yourself,

It's dangerous.

Get out!

[Singing from the shower]

*Trouble here, trouble
there, follow me...*

"I'm going crazy
for my liberty..."

Hey, get off my
driveway, fool.

Get back to

But I think you should know
that Crystal has been

Working Ben all week.

And she's the
new house mouse.

Well, I'm back now.

Besides, Ben is a man.

Bully, touch me

I took very good care
of that like you want.

Don't, don't

You know, we always
got your fat sack,

Open the door.

This was all...

Close it, quietly.

You want some
dope, you pay for it.

Got race issues?

Get rid of them but

Get it?

Sure, yeah.

Hey wait, before you

Why are you here?

Oh, that's really none
of your fucking business.

The only thing
you need to know.

I don't belong here.

Somebody made a fucking
mistake and I'm not crazy.

Well, Huerto,
I am.

And you better
be careful.

You want some
of this?

Sure, yeah.

You got something

I'm not giving anything

You're the only

This is a business, remember?

Well, I think I need a
bigger share of the business.

Raymond Saxx. OK.

Music fans worldwide are
gathering to bid farewell to

[Voice from TV]: Ian Scheffield,
it's latest rock sensation.

His body will be laid to
rest at the Hollywood Forever

Cemetery next Tuesday at noon
where throngs of fans have

Already gathered and
more are expected.

Producer Raymond Saxx of
Signal Hill Records is

Directly related to Ian's
rise to fame and to

His sudden, violent death.

Rumor suggests that Saxx's
young wife was openly having

An affair with the rockstar.

Jealousy and rage were
the fuel to Saxx's fire

Which seemingly burned
out of control.

Star View tonight's
insider's report that Saxx was

Unconscious at the time of
his arrest on the scene.

It is also reported that
drugs and alcohol played an

Important role in
this horrible tragedy.

At this time, producer Raymond
Saxx remains in custody,

Charged with the violent
murder of Ian Scheffield.

Ian has truly earned
his place alongside

Hollywood's most tragic deaths.

Congratulations man! You are
a celebrity killer, man.

I cannot believe
you have it in you.

This is awesome!

No!

I... I didn't do it!

I never killed anyone!

I couldn't have hurt him!

I'm just here for drugs!

I don't belong here!

I'm innocent!

So am I.

So are they.

[Speaking Spanish]

You're a bad ass now.

Stop crying and get used to
it because it sounds like you

Ain't ever going home.

[Speaking Spanish]

Mm-hmm.

I wanna go home!

I wanna go home!

You've heard of
the miracle worker?

That's me.

Just notice how I've
gotten it all shaped up.

Ray, you're gonna look
like a million bucks.

Six, seven.

Come on, dude.

Eight, nine.

Dude, get up!

No, I'm helping
ShyBoy right now.

ShyBoy's done here.


I don't want too.

You have no choice.

You're married.

You're Mrs. Detroit!

Help me!

Why?

No, no, no, no, no!

You run the dorms,
you call the shots.

Bullshit. Do something!

You have nothing but lip
service, you bitch!

Shut your mouth, you fool.

And give me some
fucking respect!

You cannot rehab
a child molester.

Be happy Detroit
didn't choose you.

He always chooses somebody.


[Detroit grunting]

Come, hey get in, get in.

Bad... bad things

Bad things

[Prisoners groan]

Hey, that's my wine!

Not anymore!

I think, I might
make bail on Tuesday.

But I'm scared to go home.

I don't have to work the
streets anymore.

I'm a stylist to
the stars now.

Bitch, please!

Your man, Hollywood
ain't a rockstar no more.

He's a broke, drug
addict, like everybody here.

You just hate on me 'cause
I was born with talent

And I have dreams.

Broken dreams, girl!

Until you put that
pipe down,

This, here... is your life.

And I run it.

Now, shut the fuck up.

Um, Mousey?

Me and the couple of
the girls... well,

We have fashions to trade

Saxx, Raymond Jr.

Okay, thank you. Now, close

Surprised to see me, huh?

Don't be.

Tia is paying me a lot of money
to clean up this mess of yours.

Let's just keep
things simple, shall we?

Sign these papers.

What are they?

That's a petition
for your divorce

And a quitclaim deed
for the house.

Stay away from my wife.

She's not your
wife anymore, Ray.

She's fucking me now.

You stupid piece of shit.

She doesn't care about you.

All she wants is
my fucking money.

Yeah, and I wanna
fucking give it to her.

Think again.

Okay, okay.

How about this?

If you don't sign the papers,
she'll witness you murder Ian.

If you do sign
the papers,

She'll witness a
complete accident.

You choose.

An accident?

The bitch is trying to
blackmail me and you know it.

Do I? Whoah! Ray, Ray.

I wasn't even there.


Come on. Wise up, Ray.

You're not in control anymore.

You haven't been

And you wanna go home,

No bullshit.

By the way, uh, Tia put
$30, 000 on your books.

She said she's
taking everything else.

Oh, except she
don't want your car.

She said it
smelled like you.


We got a deal.

Great!

He'll be released
sometime tomorrow.

What are you doing?!

I'm shutting
down your business.

What the hell?

What's wrong with you man,
you know better than this.

Don't you talk
to me like that.

I'm sick and tired
of your disrespect.

I run this office, not you.

You don't run shit, man.

And I am tired of
you in my face man,

Every time I try
to make a move.

That's too bad.

From now on I get my share
plus 10% of all of your folds.

You've been a real Jew when
it comes to distribution.

But, that's all gonna change
now that I'm taking over.

Now, what did you say?

I said, "You're a
little fucking snitch!"

I saved your life.

You wouldn't survive an
hour out on the line.

I saved your life!

Go fuck yourself!

Go fuck myself?

I think you know it
doesn't work that way.

Take down your pants, bitch.

No way man, never again.

Do it.

You're dead!

Prisoner Shapiro

Open the door!

You're dead!

You're dead!

I got some good news.

I'm making some
changes around here.

Ben got himself declassified,
so you get to be my new bitch.

Kill yourself!

You're facing a murder beef.

I think we're gonna be seeing
each other for a long time.

I'm gonna have you every day.

Well?

Ben's fucking gone.

There's no more dope
and there's no more cash.

We are so fucked.

Any ideas?

I have an idea.

What do you say we
play, "Let's make a deal?"

I don't know.

What do you have in mind?

I have Ben's job now.

And a shitload of cash.

You wanna play now?

Hmm.

So if you can pull it off,
we both get what we want.

I have to admit, Junior.

It's a good fucking idea.

Okay.

Okay.

My mind is evil as it twists.

My mind is evil as it twists.

My mind is evil...

I can't resist...

I can't resist...

I can't resist...

Oh, yeah. This is
some good shit.

Oh, yeah Mrs. Detroit.

I know you was gonna
come around to Big Daddy.

I'm fucked up...

Now, it's my turn.

I'm fucked up.

Shh. Close your eyes.

Just relax.

Butterfly is going
to take care of you.

Mmm. [Laughs]

Perching...

Beating...

Humming...

Just cause Daddy has it coming.

Give it to me, baby.


You're going to try with
all your might.

I see you drowning
in despair.

You play rough,
Butterfly.

You'll find that I
don't play fair.

Hey, hey, hey.

Hey, hey.

Do you have any
blood on you?

No.

I was careful.

It's okay, it's
okay, it's okay.

Shh. Shh, shh.

Knock it off. Take a deep
breath and calm down.

Hey, go sit on the back
wall and don't talk to anyone.

Do you understand?

You got balls, girl.

We'll cover your ass,
nobody's saying nothing.

Your boy Detroit's
got quite a record.

Six convictions for
child molestation,

Two rape convictions,
drug abuse,

Ah hell.

He wouldn't have survived the
mainland up in Fulsom, anyway.

No family, no next of kin.

They ain't gonna find
no knife, are they?

It's about time
somebody did something.

This guy was just
waiting for sentencing.

Johnson, what was
he up to in here?

Nothing I know of.

They all try to stay
clear of him, huh?

Nothing sir, no
weapons of any kind.

Thank you.

Well, somebody in
here killed him.

Homicide will be back out here
tomorrow for more questioning.

But I tell you, I'm not
gonna change up my program

For that pile of shit.

Resume normal activity
until further notice.

Concur.


Goddamn it! [Sighs]

You know, the Lord works
in mysterious ways

And I ain't one
to question him.

But what I do know is,
ever since you got here

Things ain't
been the same.

Roll it up for release.

You really are
straight, aren't you?

Yes, honey. I am.

And you've been straight with
me all along, haven't you?

Yes, I have.

So, we have a deal?

Now it's all on you,
baby. Make it happen.

Mm.

You can count on it.

Hey!

Lifesaver.

Call me!

It's his phone number!

There goes a real gangster.

You should be taking notes.

Saxx? Saxx!

Face the wall.

This is my dorm.
I'll take it from here.

Jerome, Captain Davis called
and said he don't want you

Going nowhere until this
dorm is back up and running.

Face the wall!

When?! When did
he call?!

When did he say that?!

I'll be waiting, Saxx.

Everybody comes back.

Everybody comes back!

Saxx! Do you hear me?

I'll see you again!

You know how
scandalous I can be.

And I ain't afraid of no pig.

Yes?

May I come in?

You're the only man
I got left in here.

Are you
mad at me?

A little bit.

You got rid of
the competition.

Now, we're
all alone!

I can't believe
you're really here.

Why not?

Ben's gone,
Ray's gone.

Who's gonna run this
place with you, huh?

What? Well, now you know
they earned their position.

Yeah?

Well, I have no
problem with that.

I'm a working
girl, you know this.

Oh my god!

I've waited so
long for this.

Oh my god.

You taste so good,
just like a real woman.

Hold on. You wanna take
my breath away, Papi?

Ben didn't know
how to get down.

He was from
the West Side.

No. I...

No, honey. This
ain't no honeymoon.

I want a jailhouse
fuck, and I want it now!

Harder!

I said harder!

I'll give it to
you harder.

You take it, you take
it, you do what I say.

I'll fuck you, I'm
gonna make you bleed!

I'm gonna make
you fucking bleed!

Tell me what to do, I'm
gonna make you bleed.

Stop it!

Stop it!

Stop that, what the...

I'm gonna split your
ass, you fucking cunt!

I'm gonna fuck you...

Don't make me hit you,
I'll choke you out,

You little fuckin' Medina.
Stop it, please! Stop it!

Oh hell no, this
shit ends right now.

Hey, do you hear this?

Do something!

Now!

I don't want it...

Don't you tell
me what, shut up.

You shut up!

You shut up!

Stop!

She was, she was...

We...

Someone really loves you.

Not anymore.

I'd like to put
some of this money

On another
inmate's account.

On a scale of 1 to 10, how
would you describe your pain?

Well, it comes in waves.

But, definitely a 10.

I would never hurt you!

You seduced me!

You seduced me!

You said you wanted a
jailhouse fuck, remember?

You said you wanted
a jailhouse fuck!

He raped me and then
he tried to kill me.

No!

That, that is so
wrong. It's bullshit!

You tried to hang
me with your belt!

You told me to!

No!
You told me to!

Look at my neck!

It's red and blue!

Alright, alright!

I'm a lady, goddamn it!

That's enough.

Mr. Ruiz, are you
gonna press charges?

Absolutely.

For what?

Well, you really came out
of the closet on this one.

A murder in the
dorm, and now rape?

No!

I can't ignore your actions
any longer, Gerald.

Lt. Villalobos, cuff him.

Book him with rape and
suspicion of murder.

Then dump his
ass in the hole.

We'll deal with
him later!

But this is outrageous!

You can't...

Now on your feet, face the
wall, hands behind your back.

Get them behind your back.

I didn't!
She's lying!

This is outrageous!
Liar!

It's not right!
It's not right!

I gotta get out of
here before I get sick.

Theresa, I wouldn't object
to put you in charge here.

Are you up for that promotion?

Yes, sir.

Good.

I want a report on my
desk tomorrow morning.

Hernandez, let's go.

Oh, thank you.

You're ready to go
home, sweetheart?

Well, I would like to call
my Mom first if that's okay.

Okay, honey. I'll be
waiting for you outside.

Oh, uh, I'm gonna
be needing a clerk.

Are you interested?

Yeah.

All right,
five minutes.

Hello?

Ola, Junior.

Where are you?

I just stepped
outside.

Wave at me, I'm
watching you.

So, um, Johnson's in the hole.

Um, Davis charged him with
rape and Detroit's murder.

He was so scared when
they dragged him away.

I bet he -he's crying
like a bitch right now.

Fuck, yeah!

Listen, Huerto.

You got your revenge, I
want my fucking money.

Check your
fucking books, okay?

Open 11!

Opening 11!

Here's your cell.

Get me the hell out of here!

No!

Don't move, Gerald.

Just save your
strength, asshole.

Trust me. You're
gonna need it.

On your feet.

Come on. Get up!

Get in!

Close 11!

Closing 11!

No, wait!

Payback's a
bitch, hey Johnson?

No, no, I can't...

Hello, Washington?

It's good to see you.

It's nice to see you too, sir.

Hey, buddy.

Come here!

Hey, hey!

Hey, boy.

Do you think the
car smells like me?

I certainly hope not.

Where to? Tommy's?

I'll let you buy
me a burger.

I love you, Huerto!
