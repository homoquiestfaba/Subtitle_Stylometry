<i>â™ª Happy birthday to you</i>

<i>â™ª Happy birthday to you</i>
(GROANS)

<i>â™ª Happy birthday
Audrey Stockman</i>

<i>â™ª This little lady over here</i>

<i>â™ª This funny, gorgeous</i>

<i>â™ª Funny, wonderful lady
over here</i>

<i>â™ª It's Audrey</i>

<i>â™ª It's your birthday

(ALL CHEERING)
(AUDREY SIGHS)

Morgan, you're such
a fucking freak. I love you.

I love you.
Where'd you steal that microphone from?

<i>Audrey, you know me. You know
that I own microphones.</i>


(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Fuck me! Tess is here.

Oh, my God!
The audacity. (SCOFFS)

Morgan...
The sheer hubris

to show up here
at your birthday.

Morgan...
There was a minimum

number of people
in order to reserve the bar.

Morgan...
I'm so sorry. Oh, my God!

I didn't think she would come.

Oh, she's ordering
a custom cocktail.

I'm gonna kill myself.

What do I say? Huh? Like,

"My boyfriend dumped me
in a text message."

How do I explain that?
I know.

There's a simple solution.
It's called lying.

No. I'm a really bad liar.

I know, 'cause you ramble.
You give too many details.

And then people know
that you're lying.

You have to be concise
about it.

Here, ask me
what I've been up to lately.

Um, what have you been up to?
I bought a boat. And we're out.

Oh, my God. She's coming over here.
I'm with you.

Let's do this.
Okay.

Hey, ladies!

I can't do this.
Oh, you're fucking dead to me!


Hey, girl!

Where's your
adorable boyfriend?


You know, you guys make
such a surprising couple.

Like, if I didn't meet him
as your boyfriend,

I would assume he'd be dating
someone more...

Like, edgy. Like a cool girl.
Like a model.

But then
I see you two together,

and it's like,
"Aw, this works too."

Where is he?
So I can hug him.

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)


(MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)


(ENGINE STARTS)

This is crazy because
you're from the Ukraine...

...and I just auditioned

to be a Ukrainian farm girl
in a GEICO ad.

And?
They told me

I was too authentic.
Anyway...

Is it Ukraine or the Ukraine?

Well, it depends.

You say how you like,
you know?

Always let beautiful,
sexy woman decide.

(CLICKS TONGUE) Okay.
(CHUCKLES)

That's what this is?

You know...
All right.

You have face like doll.

Mmm. Okay.

Such a small, narrow waist.
It's tiny.

You know,
I was gonna drive home,

but now I think I might
just drive into a wall.

Hit me. (CHUCKLES)

Wait, I can use this.

Come here.

Audrey.
Yeah?

This is Viktor. He's a
visitor from Eastern Europe.

He has something that
he wants to say to you.

I do?
Yeah, yeah.

This is my best friend.
She's having a bad night.

Can you just use
your aggressive masculinity

for good instead of for evil?

Just tell her
what you told me before.

What are you doing?

You have doll face.

No, make it specific to her.

Like really
objectify her.

Yeah?
MORGAN: Yeah.

Okay, cool. Uh...

You have big baby eyes.

Mmm.
And, phew, soft...

(SMACKS LIPS) Supple udders. Yeah.
Oh.

Oh, my God! What the fuck?
MORGAN: Wow!

Thank you so much, Viktor.

You've done good work.
Okay.

Thank you so much.
Okay, bye-bye.

I fucking hate you.

Oh, come on! You're smiling.

MAN: Hey, Audrey.
Where's Drew?

He drowned.

Ugh. Do you see?
This has been all night long.

Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

You have to move on.
Yes, I know.

It's just really hard
to do that

when he left a box of his shit
in our apartment,

and he won't even text me back
about picking it up.

I know.

Oh, can I see your phone?
Yeah.

I just have to
Google something.

MORGAN: Whew!

(SIGHS)
(TYPING)

Who are you texting?
(MUMBLES)

Morgan, let me see my phone.

I'm texting Drew.
Oh, my God!

I said, "Fuck you,
you worthless nutsack.

"I'm setting your shit
on fire."

Oh, my God, no!
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Why the fuck
would you write that?

'Cause we're gonna
set his shit on fire.


(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Fuck!


Really, Drew?

Skid marks
on your underwear?

What are you, eight?

Did he want me to wash them?

Is that why
he broke up with me?

'Cause I didn't
mother him enough?

Fuck you. Wipe your own ass.

Okay. Oh, what's this?

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

This is actually
a handwritten list

of his favorite breakfast
burrito places in Los Angeles.

Stop! He made notes.
Yep.

"Great egg to tortilla ratio."

Fuckin' idiot.

Burn the fire.
MORGAN: Burn!

Oh, my God! His trophy.

Second place trophy,
fantasy football.

And he saved it.

No! It's not
even real football.

It's a fucking fantasy!

Oh, wait.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

Oh, my God. It's Drew.

(LINE RINGING)

AUDREY: <i>Hello?</i>
Hey.

Really? That's it? "Hey"?

Are your ears burning?
'Cause your shit is.

I'm sorry. I fucked up, okay?

<i>Hold on. What?</i>

What do you mean,
you fucked up? Which part?

I'm gonna come over tomorrow,

and I'm going to
explain everything, okay?

Please don't do anything
with my stuff.

I'll be back tomorrow.
(TIRES SCREECHING)

(DOOR OPENS)

Drew?

(LINE DISCONNECTS)

Drew!


(BOTH GRUNTING)

(NECK SNAPS)


(LOUD EXPLOSION)

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER


Oh! I'm so sorry.
That's okay.

Happy birthday.

How...

Yep.
The... Yeah.

Uh, it's not my birthday.
Oh.

I just kinda wear it
for warmth.

Well, if it was your birthday,
I would say, um...

"Happy birthday."

Well, I'd probably say,
"Thank you."

You're welcome.

Hey.

I got a quarter left.

Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

is to find the absolute
worst song on the jukebox.

Okay.

(COIN CLINKS)


MAN: One gum, please.

AUDREY: Oh.

Yeah.


Um...

$2.25.

(CASH REGISTER BEEPING)

(COINS CLINKING)

Have a great day.

Aren't you gonna ask me
if I need help to my car?


So, um...

Where are you from?

Uh...

England.

That's what I thought.

Yeah, but sometimes
when I think that

people end up
being Australian.

Ah. People do sometimes end up
being Australian.


Oh, God! I don't
actually mean "shut up."

It's a figure of speech.

I don't know
if you do that in England.

What? Figures of speech?

Yeah.
Yeah. We invented that.

Right.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

You know, some...

Some might say that I'm not
exercising good judgment

following a strange man
somewhere.

This is how
people get shoved

in the back
of sketchy vans, right?

That makes this
rather awkward.

Mmm.

Get in the van.

What?

(ENGINE STARTING)

(VAN DOOR SLAMS)
Oh, my God! (STAMMERS) Okay, what is happening?

Did I do something wrong?
Am I in trouble?

Listen, we just wanna talk
about Drew Thayer.

He's your boyfriend, right?
No.

I mean, yes. Well, he was my
boyfriend, but we broke up.

Why? Is he in trouble?

Yes. Drew is
in a lot of trouble.

That's why you're in a van.

SEBASTIAN: Do you know where

your ex-boyfriend worked,
Miss Stockman?

Uh, yeah. NPR.

He had a podcast.
It was about, um...

I'm not 100% sure
what it was about,

but like jazz and economics.

listened to that podcast.

Not even me,
and I went to Harvard.

Wow. Only took you
two minutes.

Well, I had to give her that
for context, Seb.

That podcast
was Drew's cover job.

Well, Drew never mentioned
having another job.

Listen, Drew was CIA.

I'm sorry. What?

Oh, my God!

You were in Vegas
when we saw Celine Dion?

Ironically.

Oh, my God!
Listen, Drew's gone missing.

A lot of innocent people are
gonna die unless we find him.

Has he been in contact
with you?

No.

Are you sure?
Mmm-mmm. No.


Oh, unless it was
last Tuesday night,

'cause I dropped
my phone in the tub

and it stopped working
for a little while.

That's... Yep,
that's what happened.

So I went on the Internet,

and I was like,
"How do I fix my phone?"

It said to put it
in a bag of rice,

so I was like,
"I don't have rice."

Okay. You do not
wanna lie to us.

Okay. Okay, fine.
Yes, he called me last night.

Well, I guess he called me back.
Finally.

I called him, like,
a thousand times.

Just this week, after I
stopped hearing from him.

I called him, like, a normal
amount when we were together.

I'm normal.

Okay.

MORGAN: Oh, my God.
I love you, Mom.

Morgan.
Morgan, I need to talk to you.

Oh, wait.
Audrey just got home.

I need to talk to you.
I need to talk to you.

Viktor is in my room
right now.

I don't know
who the fuck that is.

Viktor, the guy from the bar
last night.

Turns out
I left my driver's license.

He sent me a Facebook message.

And then he sent me
two pictures of his dick.

Okay. I don't...
I don't really... I know,

I don't wanna reward
that kind of behavior either,

but I needed
my driver's license back.

I'm not gonna go to the DMV.
I mean, kill me.

Totally. Can we just... I just
need to tell you something.

But I'm using this opportunity
to teach him about feminism.

There he is. Hey.

You remember Audrey
from last night?

Yeah. You know, Audrey,

"There is no limit to what
we women can achieve."

Michelle Obama.

Okay. I take shower.

MORGAN: Okay.

He's doing very well.
One second.

Mom, did you get the dick pics
that I forwarded you?

Morgan.
What?

Audrey thinks it's weird
that we tell

each other everything.
I think it's...

I know.
Of course, it's normal.

Yes! That's what I said.

It looks like an unbaked
crescent roll.

(GROANS)
No, I know you like them uncut.

Wait, hold on. My mom wants
to know if you've ever been

with an uncircumcised guy?
Oh, my God.

Morgan, I'm begging you.
Get off the fucking phone!

Okay, I love you.
I'll talk to you later.

What?

Get this. Two guys show up
at my work from the CIA.

They wanna talk about Drew.

They said he's a spy.

(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

What do you mean, a spy?

Morgan, I'm serious.

They showed me photos of him

with, like, dead bodies
and, like, weapons and blood.

Wait, wait. What? What?
I know.

I know this sounds batshit crazy,
but just think about it, okay?

There were so many unanswered
questions about that guy.

Like if he went to Vassar,

why does he pronounce it
"liberry"?

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!


Couldn't remember
if you were 3-A or 3-B.

Hey.
What?

I'm not great on text.
I'm better on email.

You know that. I'm...

Why does it smell like
lighter fluid?

Because I wasn't kidding
when I told you

I was gonna
set your shit on fire.

Look, listen, I get it.

It's a long story.

There was something
that I had to deal with.

Okay? I just wasn't
in the right headspace.

I know you're a spy.

Yeah.

These guys
showed up at my work,

shoved me into a van,

and showed me
these horrible photos.

Where...
(GUN COCKING)

What did you tell 'em?
What do you mean,

"What did I tell them?"
You're not gonna deny to it?

Or tell me those photos
were photoshopped or anything?

Oh, my God!
You have a fucking gun!

I need you to tell me
exactly what you told them.

Wait, is this why
you broke up with me?

What's on your forehead?
What?

You have, like, this little
red dot on your forehead.

Oh, shit!
AUDREY: Oh, my God!

Go, go, go!
(AUDREY SCREAMING)

Stay down!
(GUNSHOTS)

Go! Go!

Stay down!

Stay away from the windows!

Dad, I have to call you back.

(AUDREY SHRIEKING)

AUDREY: What the fuck
is going on?

Morgan!

Wait, you're bleeding.


Some bad people are after me.

The CIA?

And some other people too.
And now they're after you.

It's exactly why I left you.
Oh, my God.

I didn't want you in danger.


It's also why I left you this.

Your trophy?
Because I trust you.

A lot of innocent people
are gonna die

unless we get this
to where it needs to go, okay?

So what we're gonna do is, we're
gonna leave the apartment.

We're gonna go
to Vienna. Okay?

And we're gonna go
to Cafe Schiele.

We're gonna meet
someone named Verne

at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

Wait. Why are you
telling me this

if we're doing this together?

In case I don't make it
outta here alive.

No, Drew, you're not gonna die.
Listen to me. (SHUSHING)

11:00 a.m.
Cafe Schiele. Verne.

You got it?
Okay, got it.

And don't trust anybody.

Anybody.



<i>Do svidanya,</i> Drew.

AUDREY: Oh, my God!


(VIKTOR YELPS)


(CAR HORNS HONKING)
(ALARMS BEEPING)

Oh, my God! Drew's dead.

(BANGING ON DOOR)
AGENT: Open up!

MORGAN: Fire escape!
Fire escape.

AGENT: Open up now!
We got a search warrant!


AGENT 1: Hallway clear!

AGENT 2: Door right.

AGENT 3: Clear!

Check it!

Are you okay?
What?

No! Are you?

No.
Okay.

So, um,
where are we going?

I don't know.
Where are we gonna be safe?

Pull into that parking lot.

There's a bathroom
in that Pilates Plus.

We are not hiding
in a fucking Pilates Plus.

Where's the police station?

What? No, police.

We're not doing police
'cause I killed someone.

AUDREY: Oh, my God!
MORGAN: Oh, my God!

Call the CIA guys.

No! Drew said
that we can't trust anyone,

and he's right,
'cause he's dead!

Probably because
I talked to them.

No, it's 'cause
I let the assassin

into the apartment.

Okay, fair enough.
It's both our faults.


Shit!
You gonna get the call?

Hello.

(OVER SPEAKER)
<i>Audrey, it's Sebastian.</i>

You killed Drew.

I told you
where he was gonna be,

and you fucking killed him!

Sorry, can I ask a question?
Who is this?

That's the asshole
from the CIA.

SEBASTIAN: <i>Audrey,
where are you taking it?</i>

Why would I tell you?

<i>Give us the package.</i>

<i>Trust me.</i>

I don't trust anyone anymore.

You trust me though, right?

Yes, of course, I trust you.
You don't count.

Good. 'Cause this is not
some fake spy friendship

that the Russians
put together.

Dude, shut up. I know.

Okay, Drew said that if
we don't deliver this package,

a lot of people are gonna die.

What if we don't do it
and then there's

a terrorist attack
or something?

Well, what did he say to do?

We have to get it
to a cafe in Vienna.

Austria, Vienna?

Yes. That's what he said.
Okay. Well, why don't we do that then?

Do what? Go to Europe

when a bunch of people
are trying to kill us?

Do you wanna die
having never been to Europe?

Or do you wanna go to Europe
and die having been to Europe?

Why are those
my only two options?

Okay. This is a sign.

Our passports
are still in there

from our road trip to Tijuana.

Okay, someone that you love

just died and asked you
to do one last thing.

I think you gotta do it.

I'll go with you.

Okay, fuck it. Let's just...
Let's go to Austria.

Let's go to Austria.

Why are you turning?
AUDREY: I have to park.

MORGAN:
People are trying to kill us.

We're not fucking
parking in Lot C.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

MORGAN: <i>We need a suitcase.</i>

I think it looks suspicious if we
go through international security

with no luggage and just
a weird trophy, right?

Wait. Wouldn't it be
more suspicious

if we go through security
with a suitcase

that's totally empty
except for the weird trophy?

Yes. We need
more trophies then.

That's what we'll do.

We'll be the kind of women
who jet off to Vienna

with all of our awards.

We're notable.
We're recognized.

We have trophies, baby!

"Best Grandson"?

Yes.

Don't be nervous.

People get caught
when they're not confident.

Hello, are you new?
I usually deal with Cesar.

get rid of our phones.

Bad guys can track us
even if they're off.

Oh, right. I've actually
known that for a long time.

I went to performing arts camp
with Edward Snowden.

Oh, that's right.
You used to date Snowden.

No, no. He tried.

God, he was obsessed with me.

He was really into ska.

When the whole thing
was going down, I was like,

"Why is no one
talking about the fact

"that Edward Snowden
is really into ska?"

Give me your phone.
Oh, yeah.

Right?

Congratulations.
Thank you.

That's the worst.
Thank you.

They play this kind of stuff
in Europe all the time.

It's like the whole
continent just said,

"You know what? I love 1994.
Let's just stay here."

I wouldn't know.
I've never been to Europe.

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(BELL TOLLING)

Oh!

WAITER: For our special today,

I would recommend
our meat and bread platter

with a hot pot of fondue.

AUDREY: This is really fancy.

We belong here.

Was this a place that Drew
would hang out at?

I mean, Drew. Like...

The same guy that called
7-Eleven sushi Japanese food.

Okay. Who do we
think Verne is?

I don't know.

And won't Verne
be looking for Drew?

Fuck!
How's he gonna know it's us?

God damn it!
What do we do?

(TAPS UTENSIL ON PLATE)

Oh, no. What's wrong?
What do you see?


Oh, nothing.
It's just that, um,

cake's a lot of flour
and dairy for me. I...

I have to have diarrhea.

Okay.
Okay. (STOMACH RUMBLING)


Morgan, you should...
You should probably go.

I can hold it.
No.

No. Mmm. You should probably not do that.
No.

No.
No, this is more important.

No! Oh, my gosh.
It's really not. Please go.

Can I bring you anything else?

Uh, no.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

(GASPS)
Don't make a noise.

I'm the person
you're here to meet.

I'm sorry.
Um, you're Verne?

It's an alias.
Now, hand the package over.

is making any sense.

(AUDREY GASPS)

Oh, my God!
Don't say a word.

Okay.

Oh, my God.

(CONVERSES WITH WAITER
IN GERMAN)

I'm trying to protect you.

Yeah. The same way
you protected Drew?

If you were here
to protect me,

you wouldn't be
pointing a gun at me.

I may not be in the CIA,
but I know that much.

MI6, actually.
Drew was CIA.

It's an international effort.

Whatever!

(TOILET FLUSHING)

You're Verne?

<i>Guten Morgen.</i>

<i>Guten</i> Verne.

Would you please stop
pointing that?

It's making me very nervous.

When I get nervous...
Sit still and listen.

Okay.

In a moment, everyone in this
cafe is gonna start shooting.

They all want
what you've got,

and they'll kill
each and every one of us

until they get it.

If you run,
you'll be killed.

If you do manage to get out,

you won't be able
to go anywhere.

If you scan your passport
at the border,

there will be men with guns
bigger than this one

that won't say a word
before they kill you.

And if you do make it
to the airport,

we'll be waiting for you.

So hand the package over,
and no one gets hurt.

Except for Drew.

Okay. It's not productive
to keep bringing that up.

That's not Verne.

The package.

Good.

That's not Verne!

Hello. Hi, can we go, please?

Mr. Yang?
AUDREY: Yeah.

Yeah, my mother
married a Chinese man.

It's a very long,
beautiful story. They met...

We are Yang.
We are Mr. Yang. Yes.

All right.
MORGAN: Thank you so much.

AUDREY: Thank you.
We gotta go.

MORGAN: And we're on the gas.

So, you guys visiting?
No, we live here.

I'm an Austrian man
named Mr. Yang. Go.

So, I'm Lukas.

How can I make your ride

in Vienna excellent today?
Everything's fine.

Everything's great.
Can you just drive?

Oh, no. Fine is not
good enough for me.

Okay.
I want excellent.

Would you like some waters?
Still? Sparkling?

No, water. Fully hydrated.

Would you like
to listen to music?

No. No, no. No music.
Just drive, please.

But I'm not only
a driver, actually.

I'm also a DJ

Oh, get out!
Wow, that's cool.

I don't know
if you guys are still in town

on Saturday, but look.

Hip-hop music.

Okay, why are you using

You're literally telling him
where we're going.

Sorry. It's a force of habit.

It's a bad habit.

No! It's a good habit.

In most circumstances,
it is a very good habit!

Oh, my God!

Fuck you!

Eat my shit!

Oh, my God!
MORGAN: Okay.

AUDREY: Get in the front.

Yep. Yeah.

Oh, no!

(TIRES SCREECHING)


I can't get my seat belt on!
Where the fuck is he?

(MACHINE GUN FIRING)
Oh, my God!


He's on the fucking roof!

Oh, no! It's the man! Stop it!

AUDREY: Oh, my God!
MORGAN: Oh, my God!


He's on the top!
He's on the top!

No!

Okay. There she goes.

(MAN GRUNTING)

Why are you speeding up?
I got a plan!

Okay!
Hold on!

(TIRES SCREECHING)
(MAN SCREAMING)

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

(MAN GRUNTING)

(BOTH SCREAMING)

(HORN BLARES)

Get the fuck out!
Okay!

Great job! Five stars, Lukas!

Five stars!

Oh, my God!

Oh, God! Jesus!
What happened?

We gotta go.

We gotta go somewhere.
Oh, God!

There's a train station.

(SIREN BLARING)

So you're saying you failed?

<i>No, there were some
unforeseen complications,</i>

but I do have the package.

<i>Let's see it.</i>


It appears I don't have it.

WENDY:
<i>So let me get this right.</i>

You didn't get the package.

The girls still have
the package.

And now Highland is likely
to get the package.

I won't
let that happen, ma'am.

I'm glad that this happened.

Otherwise, you wouldn't have
been awarded Best Grandson.

<i>Okay. That's funny.</i>

Ma'am?
Ma'am, can you hear us?

Ma'am, did you hear us?

<i>Ma'am, are you frozen?</i>
<i>Ma'am, can you hear us?</i>

<i>She's frozen.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

DUFFER: <i>Ma'am, wave
if you're not frozen, please.</i>

Not frozen.

<i>Just disappointed.</i>

trying to protect them.

<i>Protect them?</i>

Yeah, let them die.
They're idiots.

I know an idiot when I see one.
In the mirror.

Okay. I'm not an idiot,
Sebastian. For the record...

Here we go. You went to
Harvard. Yes, we all know.

I didn't even mention Harvard.
That's the thing.

<i>He was gonna mention Harvard. I was
making this simply about merit,</i>

<i>and, yeah...</i>

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Yes. Get in. Okay, look.

I got us two tickets
to Prague.

I got us a change of clothes.
Okay, great. We can change

on the train. It leaves in,
like, 10 minutes.

And then we can fly home
from there.

We just need to get
the fuck out of Vienna.

Wait. Can we just take
a second to appreciate you?

Now? Right now?
Yes.

What you did in the cafe
with the gun was insane.

You killed a man.

It's okay. It was a bad man.
Oh, my God!

I just play
a lot of video games.

Can we please just...
No, and then

what you did with the trophies.
You switched the trophies.

He literally works
in intelligence,

and yet, you were
the more intelligent.

How crazy is that?

And then you did all that
car stuff. Oh, my God!

It all just kinda happened really quickly.
Can we please just move on?

Woman, you are incredible,
and I want you to own it.

Listen, I'm owning it.
Can we just go, please?

Wait! Wait!
Oh, my God!

No, I'm not gonna
let you minimize this.

I'm not minimizing!
But you always do this.

You always do this.

Oh, my God!
Have you ever,

in your whole life,
felt so alive?

ANNOUNCER: (ON PA) <i>Attention, the
train to Prague is now boarding.</i>

We're gonna be
a lot less alive

if we don't make it out
to the train. Okay? Please.

Wait, wait, wait.
Look at this.

They're really playing up
that Mozart is from here,

and they're really downplaying
that Hitler is from here.

Yeah, I would too. Get out.
Okay.

AUDREY: What track is it?

Um, looks like
track 10 goes to, um...

"Szkalas."

"Szass... Szabadszallas."

"Nove Hodejovice."

AUDREY: "Usti Nad Labem."

"Parndorf ich Bahnhof.
Prague."

"Prague." Track six.
Oh, thank God.

Okay, track six.
Wait. No, no, no, no, no!

Sebastian said
if we use our passports

we'll get stopped at the border.

Shit!

What do we do?

Okay. We just have to find
two girls who look like us,

tell them what happened, and
convince them to give us theirs,

and then they could say
that theirs were stolen.

Who would do that?
Any girls.

Any girls would do that.

Okay.

How about them?
They kinda look like us.

No, we don't wanna
be them in Europe.

We wanna be them in Europe.

We go all the way
down there,

and then it ends up
being there.

Yeah, we do.
Tight shorts.

Just imagine the only guy
you've ever loved

dying in front of you

and asking you
to do this one thing.

Wouldn't you
sacrifice everything?

Imagine if that was
your best friend of 12 years.

Wouldn't you go to the ends

of the Earth to protect her?
Yes.

You guys are weird.

Okay. Actually,
we're not "weed."

We are in danger.

You'd be saving our lives

and the lives
of a lot of innocent people.

AUDREY: Just go to the embassy
and get other passports.

Sorry. We'd love to
help you out, mate,

but we just don't know you.

ANNOUNCER: (ON PA)
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>the train to Prague

You're right. Okay.
You know what?

Have a great time in Poland.
MORGAN: It's been beautiful meeting you.

Now!

Go! Get it! Shit!
TOURIST 1: Stop it!

No! (SCREAMS)

No!
Stop it!

I got it!
Stop! No!

Oi! Give me back my bum bag!

Come on! Get in!

Okay.
Oh, my God!

Close! Oh, my God!
Close.

(SCREAMS) Open the door!
I'm sorry.

Give me back my fucking
bum bag, you bitch!

MORGAN: Look,
your address is on it,

so I can mail it back to you
if we survive.

Hello?


MAN: Nadedja.

Nadedja, where are you?

Nadedja, you're going to miss
your cue again.

You always do this.

(MAN SPEAKS GERMAN)

(ENGINE STARTS)

I feel like
my best friend always knew

that she wanted
to be an actress.

She's just natural at it.
Mmm.

I'm not a natural at anything.
(CHUCKLES)

I tried law school.
Oh, smart.

Then I tried art school.
That's good.

Big swing there.

I dropped out of both.

Yeah,
I never finish anything.

Well, hey,
you just finished your beer.

Yeah, that I do finish.


So why don't you finish things?
What are you afraid of?

Mmm.

Being average.

Come on. I would not say
that you are average.


How would you know?
You just met me.

I'm a pretty good judge
of character.

You trust me.

Thank you for the dance.

Would you like me
to get you another beer?

Yeah! That'd be great.
Sure.

Can I get two more, please?
BARTENDER: No problem.

Thank you.

Cool, cool, cool. Okay,
so here's my advice, right?

Who are you?
Oh, that's my sister.

Really?
Not my biological sister,

but my de facto sister.

Oh.
Yeah. She wouldn't want you to know this,

but she lost her virginity
really late,

so she's, like, hungry for it.
You know what I mean?

Oh. Cool.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

So have fun with that.

But if you hurt her,

I'll find your best friend...
Mmm-hmm.

...I'll cut off his dick...
Mmm-hmm.

...and I'll make you eat it.

Oh, okay.
Yeah.

You can have whatever
condiments you like,

but you gotta finish it.

What's your name?

Morgan. How you doing?
Morgan. Drew.

Morgan, anyone ever tell you
you're a little much?

AUDREY: Why didn't you tell me
that he said that?

You were so into him,

and you can't say shit like
that to your best friend

when your best friend's
in love with somebody.

It didn't hurt my feelings.

Well, a little bit. It hurt
my feelings a little bit.

Morgan. Hey.

I'm really sorry.

I'm sorry too.

I'm sorry he died.

Oh, God.

MORGAN: What do we do
with this thing?

AUDREY: I don't even know
what this thing is

or what it does, or anything.

God, I feel like such an
idiot about all this.

I mean, I met his parents.

They were so normal.

Their names
are Tom and Marsha.

The night
before he disappeared,

we all went
to The Cheesecake Factory.

Oh, my God, that menu.

Dostoevsky wrote that menu.

Who introduces people that
don't matter to their parents?

Well, I do. I introduce
everyone to my parents.

But that's their gain,
'cause my parents are magic.

Do you think they knew?
I don't know.

I just wish
that he was still alive,

so I could get some answers.

And then I would tell him
to fucking die.

(TROPHY CLATTERS)


Open it.

Fuck!

There.

What the fuck is that?

AUDREY: It's a flash drive.

MORGAN: They were killing
each other for this?

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

You know who would know
what we should do right now?

No.
My father is a brilliant attorney...

No. Mmm-mmm.
...who has represented people

who are in much worse trouble
than we are right now.

No. Your dad would be
furious at us

for breaking a million
international laws.

No. He's not gonna be mad.

He wasn't mad
when I tried cocaine

with my basketball coach.

He wasn't mad at me when
I got deported from Belize.

He didn't get mad when I
invited that teenage magician

to live in my grandma's condo.

Oh, yeah.
What ever happened to him?

You're not gonna believe this.
He disappeared.

(CLICKS TONGUE) Shut up.

No, he actually...
He is a missing person.

<i>I'm gonna conference your father in.</i>

This is Arnie.
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

Hey, button! Hi!

You're all over the papers.

I'm so proud of you.

I always knew the world
would write about you.

Did you color your hair?
You look like a princess.

Sweetie, let me ask you.

Did you and Audrey
murder two people?

Tell me the truth.
I can get you out of it.

No, what happened was,
I murdered one person,

but it was an assassin, so...
Shh!

So it didn't count.

No, it doesn't count.

And Audrey murdered a bunch of people in Austria.
Oh, my God!

But it was self-defense.
Also fine.

Her boyfriend was murdered
in front of us.

The handsome one?
I mean, he was fine, I guess.

Oh, you know who's really
handsome is Patrick Dempsey.

Where are you now, sweetie?
<i>I'm in Prague.</i>

I don't care for
Eastern Europe. Too gothic.

ARNIE: <i>Okay, listen. I got
a place where you can hide.</i>

Okay.
I got a friend, Roger Bernstein.

Lives in Prague.
Guy owes me a favor.

Dad represented Roger
in a malpractice suit.

ARNIE: <i>Whoa, Carol,
you know who's handsome?</i>

Woody Harrelson.
You know, people don't think it.

I find him handsome.

TOURIST 1: <i>She fell over.</i>
TOURIST 2: <i>Yeah, I did, actually.</i>

<i>There was one moment
I thought I was gonna die.</i>

<i>Yeah. They've got something
wrong with them.</i>

Morgan...

...disappeared from their LA
apartment, murdered Ukrainian...

Now. Now.
We gotta go.

Okay.

(BUZZING INSISTENTLY)

ROGER: <i>Hello?</i>
Yes, Roger,

it's Arnie's daughter.
He called.

(DOOR BUZZING)

Go. Thank you!

ROGER: <i>You know, it's funny.</i>

I remember one time,
back in the day,

your dad and I were getting
ready to go out in the Hamptons.

Your dad had
his sunglasses on.

He turned his collar up.
He looked super.

We get to the disco,
the guy says to him,

"Sir, sir,
your collar is up."

Ruined the whole effect.

Hope you don't think
I'm being presumptuous,

but I thought you gals looked
like you'd enjoy some pot

roast.

(ALL LAUGHING)

I'm okay. I'm actually...
I'm so sorry. I am a vegan.

Oh.

Morgan, you're not a vegan.

What? 'Cause of the bacon?

Bacon's meat!

Well, listen. At least let me
get you a little vino, okay?

I mean, the only
animal cruelty involved

in that is what the wine guy
charges me.

(MORGAN LAUGHS)

I actually like to keep
all the best bottles

over there in the study.
It's like a...

It's sort of like my homage

to all the great storytellers.
Yeah.

Mmm-hmm.
Right now, I'm working my way through a grenache noir

while I enjoy a first edition
of <i>La Comedie humaine.</i>

Are you into Balzac?

Less and less with every

Well, I'll be right back.

Okay.

It's happening again.
What is?

He's into me.
(LAUGHS)

What are you talking about?

He wants a slice. Rog.

No, he's just, you know,
like a little weird.

Older men, they gravitate toward me.
Okay.

They love me.
Oh, God.

They want this.
(LAUGHS)

If that makes them weird

then my SAT math tutor
was weird,

our landlord is weird.
He's weird.

Mandy Patinkin is weird.

Mmm.
I feel a little nauseated.

I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

I'm okay. You just stay.
I'll be right back.

Love you.

(DOOR OPENS)

Hi. Audrey okay?

Oh, yeah, she's fine.
She's finished. So am I.

Well, at least
let me give you a <i>digestif.</i>

(BOTH TOASTING IN FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Ah! It's dry.

So are you a lover of art?

Yeah, yeah, oh, lot of art.
Love art.

And look at that art.

Doesn't look like she's
enjoying herself too much.

Sometimes
the sweetest pleasure comes

when you're not enjoying
yourself.

Don't know
that I agree with that.

You wouldn't?

Okay. We're doing
a massage now.

Here we go.


Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!



Roger, thank you so much
for having us at your home.

It's my great pleasure.
But I just... I don't think...

I don't think so.

That actually kind...
That kind of hurts.

Huh. Hello.

Who's this? I'm Morgan.

I'm a family friend. Is this your girlfriend?
(GUN COCKS)

Nadedja, no. We have to bring them in alive.

MORGAN: Audrey.
Oh, my God!

Audrey, Roger is bad. Bad.

No, that's not Roger.

That's Roger.

Ah!

They want the drive.

You have to swallow it
before they come back.

What?
I have thrown up, like, nine times.

What?
I can't do it.

Well, I can't
swallow anything.

I can't even swallow Advil.

I have to crush it up
in my applesauce.

No. You gotta swallow this.

No, I... Oh!

Fine. Okay.
If you really want me to.

Oh, God.

Oh, God. I don't...
I don't know.

Where the fuck are we?
I don't know.

Audrey,
how are you feelin'?

Marsha, Tom. Those are...
Those are Drew's parents.

Oh, my God. I'm so sorry that
you got dragged into this.

I never meant for Drew to die.

We know you didn't, Audrey.

We're just glad
you're alive.

Will you untie us before they come
back and tie you up too? Please.

So where's the drive?

Oh.

You know about that?


Shut up, you dumb bitch.

Fuck you!

You wanna tell your friend
to answer the question?

Trust me, your son would've
wanted you to protect us.

MORGAN: Audrey...

I don't think those
are Drew's parents.

Of course, they are.
No.

We went out
to The Cheesecake Factory.

We shared
chicken lettuce cups.

We were at that restaurant to
negotiate the sale of the drive.

But we talked
about real things.

We talked about
Tom's colonoscopy.

Not getting
a colonoscopy.

He only took you to the
restaurant as insurance,

so we wouldn't kill him
if he left with the drive.

Okay, let's get this done.

Where is the fucking drive?

MORGAN: No. No.

Sir, please don't.

That's my best friend.
Please, just...

She does it all the time.

She Instagrams on the freeway.
She hashtags it "driving."

I'm proving to her that

we don't keep secrets. Just
tell her something about me.

Okay, okay. Um,

Morgan stole her dad's
pain pills after his surgery

and sold them at Coachella.
I did.

Audrey was once babysitting
this eight-year-old kid

and she flirted with him
to get him to go to sleep.

His name was Liam.

She has sex dreams
about Minions.

with the one eye.

Is that supposed to be a dick?

MORGAN: She googled it
on my computer,

and now I get
a lot of weird ads.

I said I was sorry.

Audrey shaves
between her boobs.

Uh, Morgan kissed her cousin.

I didn't know it was my cousin.
Morgan has HPV.

Audrey has HPV.

AUDREY: Morgan had sex
in a playground once.

Audrey hit a dog
in the face.

Morgan had lice as an adult.

Audrey can't come 'cause
she's on antidepressants.

I can! It just takes me
a very long time.

Oh, look.

MORGAN: Hey, hey.

It's working. It's working.
AUDREY: Yeah.

What else do you wanna know?
We'll tell you anything.

How you know
so much about her?

And she about you?

She's my best friend. We know
everything about each other.

You have a best friend, right?

Of course
she has a best friend.

Yeah.
Look at her.

You're so charming, and you
have so many good hobbies.

AUDREY: Hobbies.

You do have a best friend.

It's a temporary space.

We don't wanna

I know, but can you
hang a poster?

Can we get a drape?
Something?

This is what our tax dollars
are paying for?

You haven't paid
your taxes for three years.

You know that?

Hey, look,
Sebastian, I'm really sorry

I didn't give you
the drive at that cafe.

Nah. No, I understand.

Drew told you
to keep it safe.

Can you at least tell us
what's on that drive?

All we know is,

it was made by an
international terrorist group

named Highland.

Intelligence tells us they're
planning a series of attacks.

If we had it,
we'd know how to stop them.

Henshaw, my office.


What? Wait, wait.

This is your boss?
You're the boss?

We have a real-life
Judi Dench in our midst.

You are the boss, and yet
you have not sacrificed

one ounce of femininity.

Why have we been spending all of
this time talking to the men,

when this being has been
floating through the halls

of the building?
Oh, my God!

That's a compliment.
That is the Beyonce of the government.

Duffer, stay here.

I have so much respect
for you that it has

circled around
into objectification.

Ma'am!

I'm sorry, ma'am.
I know I overstepped.

WENDY: Overstepped? No.

I'd say what you did
was closer to treason.

Treason? I was
merely trying to help.

How long did your doctor say that
your arm would take to heal?

Um, three months
for the bullet wound,

one for the sprain.
Fantastic.

Take four months' leave.

Oh, no. I assume he meant

the two would
heal simultaneously.

I know what I said.

DUFFER: <i>Please
take me through this.</i>

What exactly was
going through your mind

when you flushed it
down the toilet?

Were you thinking,
"Oh, I know.

"People are dying
because of this.

"So here's what I'll do.

"I'll treat it like
a piece of shit,

"wrapped up in toilet paper,

"and then flush it
down the toilet"?


Oh, this is funny?
Death is funny to you?

No, I'm sorry.

But that's how
you go to the bathroom?

Oh, great. Okay. Awesome.

Great. You two laugh.

Meanwhile, let me tell you
how many people have died

and will die
because of your stupidity.

(BOTH SNICKERING)

I'm sorry. Just let me
get this straight.

So you wrap your hands
in toilet paper,

and then you poop
into that,

and then that
whole contraption

is what you drop
into the toilet?

That was just a metaphor.
You know that the toilet is designed

to take the work
out of it for you, right?

No, that's not
what I was saying.

I was say...
I didn't say that.

I poop normally.
Like everybody else.

Of course, yes. I know.
I'm sorry. Okay.

Hey, uh, I wanna say goodbye.

Where are you going?


I've been suspended.

You two are to go
back to Los Angeles.

What?
What?

Duffer, transport these women
to de Gaulle.

Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.

Please don't send us home.

Spying, not easy.
We know that now.

But we have been a real help
to this operation,

and I know the drive is gone,
but we are in this, boss.

And if you would
just give us a chance,

I think that we could be
a major resource for you.

Would you consider
keeping us on

in this intelligence bureau?

Please. Ma'am.

Okay.

All right.

I am going to take
a chance on you two.


I could really use you.

What?

Are you serious?

No.

Their flight
leaves in four hours.

Hey, Morgan, I think that we
should probably just head out.

The fact that we even survived
this is just dumb luck.

I really just wanna go home.

What? Why would you
wanna go home

in the middle of all this?

We're a part of this.

Come on, this isn't...
This isn't who we are.

Okay? We've done enough.

Can we please
just go home?

I'm done.

Morgan, now.
Okay. Yes. Yes.

That's a great idea. Hey, Seb,
why don't you drop 'em off

at the airport
on your way home?

It'll prepare you
for your next career,

being a SuperShuttle driver.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Out of curiosity,

if we still had the drive,
what would've happened?

Hypothetically?
Yeah.

Uh, I'd figure out
how to de-encrypt it,

then see what Highland's
plans are and stop them.

How do you de-encrypt
something like that?

Why do you wanna
know all this?

Because the drive
is in my vagina.

What?
What?

I mean, look, everybody kept
saying that it was so important,

and I wasn't gonna flush something
that important down the toilet.

Why didn't you
just give it to Duffer?

'Cause he's an asshole.

Wait, so when you said
you wanted to go home...

Yes, it was because I had the
flash drive in my vagina.

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

I know!
Does it hurt? Does it not hurt?

You get used to it.

Wait, so you were lying
to that bitch

when she was torturing us?

Yeah.
And you lied to me?

You broke our sacred
bond of trust.

I know, Morgan. I'm so sorry.

But it's okay,
'cause it was amazing!

I, um... Well, I don't mean to
be impolite about this but...

Do you think you could
access it from the...

Place that...

In the...
Oh, yeah.

What? Here?
Just don't look here.

Oh.

This is good. You should get it out.
'Cause the ultimate irony would be

if you saved the world, and then
died of toxic shock syndrome.

<i>â™ª She'll be coming round the
mountain when she comes</i>

<i>â™ª She'll be coming round the
mountain when she comes â™ª</i>

Okay.
Oh, there it is.

Oh.

Should I put it in the...

No. I'll, uh...
Like, a tissue?

SEBASTIAN: No, no, no.
I'll take it. I'll take it.


So are you gonna use that
to get your job back?

People at my job
just tried to kill all of us,

so, to be honest, I'm not sure
who to trust anymore.

But thank you.

For trusting me.

Now, will you trust us?

To help you?

I mean, you're injured, so I
feel like you kind of need us.

I mean, we're naturals.
We're operatives.

We're semi-professionals at this point.
Professional. We are professional.


(AUDREY GASPING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

AUDREY: So, um...

Morgan, your idea of
blending in is that outfit?

Yeah.

Do I not look
just like a French woman?

I look like a French woman.

You look like
a French curtain.

Yeah, 'cause I can hang.

Mmm. Mmm.
MORGAN: Mmm-hmm?

Something really weird
on this drive.

AUDREY:
Oh, I'm sorry. Not all of us

are perfectly waxed
porn stars down there.

Some of us have stuff.

Oh, no, I meant
the information on it.

It's State Department
encryption.

Oh.

Right.
Figures.

What do you mean?
Meaning Highland didn't make it.

Your government did.

I can't access it.
I don't have clearance.

What do you mean? You're a spy.
Can't you just hack it?

Well, they change
the password every 24 hours.

Even if I had a supercomputer,
it'd take days.

So what are you saying?

get onto the flash drive.

What?
There's gotta be something else

we can do.
Not unless you have access to an expert

in U.S. Intelligence
computer security.

One minute.

MORGAN: Um...

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

MORGAN: Mmm-hmm.

(IN ENGLISH) That's all I
remember from high school French.

Shit. What were
the lines I had

in that French
student film?

Um... (SIGHS)

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Oh, God.

No?

I need to borrow this
for one minute.

I will be there.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)


SNOWDEN: Uh-huh. Hmm.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

(IN ENGLISH) This is Edward.

Eddie. Eddie Snowden.

<i>It's Morgan
from Buck's Rock Camp.</i>

Oh, my God!

Morgan. Um...

Wow! It's been forever.

I, uh...

I sent you a bunch of emails
over the years.

You did? Shoot!

Well, that's upsetting.
I don't know where they went.

I thought that you might not
have your AOL account anymore.

Oh, yeah.
I switched to Gmail in '04.

Oh. Actually, I knew that.

Right. I guess you would.

So I've been
following the news.

<i>Oh, my God. Eddie.</i>

You have to understand,
we didn't kill anybody.

On purpose.

Of course.
It's called a frame job.

They do that. (CHUCKLES)

Tell me what you need, Morgan.
I'm here for you.

Are you near a computer?

Always.

MORGAN: A capital H.
Add sign. Lowercase U.

Lowercase J.

Percentage sign.

Yes, percentage.
MORGAN: Uppercase Y.

(BEEPING)
(AUDREY GASPS)

Oh, my God! That's right.

Okay. So?

What are Highland's plans?

These aren't
Highland's plans.

This drive is a back door
to the entire Internet.

Finances, emails.
Everyone's secrets.

We need to
get out of here now.

We gotta go.

Uh-huh.
AUDREY: Morgan.

You call me
if you're ever in LA now.

LA's gonna be hard.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

MAN: (MODULATED)
<i>I need to add another target.</i>

Double rate.
<i>No.</i>

<i>You already failed twice.
The girls are still alive.</i>

<i>Highland is very upset.</i>

(LINE DISCONNECTS)

Well, hello, beautiful.

Baby...

What happened
to your face?


What happened to yours?

AUDREY: Where we goin', chief?

SEBASTIAN: Amsterdam.
We'll be safe there.

Can I help you?

Thank you.

Nice boobs.

Thanks.

SEBASTIAN: <i>Remember, the best place to hide
is somewhere full of suspicious people.</i>

MORGAN: Oh, my God,
is this what crack smells like?

SEBASTIAN: Is this the couple
you saw at the gymnasium?

Ivan and Raisa Petrenko.

Heads of the Highland
crime syndicate.

Out of Moscow.
Oh.

Oligarchs, arms dealers,
blackmailers,

and former gymnastic coaches.

And this is their trained
assassin and former student.

Not a fan.
(TV PLAYING)

You guys. Audrey, come here.
It's us. We're on the news.

<i>Thought to be part of
a bigger terrorist plot...</i>

MORGAN: We're on TV.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
It's happening.

<i>...the women were allegedly
involved in the murder</i>

<i>of a local ophthalmologist,</i>

<i>which may have had
a sexual motive.</i>

Sexual motive?
Yeah. He wishes.

<i>The FBI has
released transcripts</i>

<i>of Facebook messages
between the suspects.</i>

Oh, shit, Morgan.
It's our chats.

"I just wish he would die.
Is that too much to ask?"


"Just for someone to expletive
murder him," said Audrey Stockman

Oh, my God.

<i>Then, "Do you want me
to murder him? I totally will.</i>

<i>"That's what friends are for.</i>

<i>"Music note emoji. Music note
emoji." Replied Morgan Freeman.</i>

Your name is Morgan Freeman.

I just put that together.

Yeah. I can always get
a reservation wherever I want.

<i>Honestly, I just don't believe</i>

<i>that Audrey would ever do this.</i>
AUDREY: Oh.

<i>She's just not that kind of person.</i>
Wow, okay.

<i>You know. She's not
that sophisticated.</i>

<i>I mean, she's 30 years old,</i>

<i>and she doesn't even
have a bed frame, so...</i>

(SIGHS)
Box spring counts. A box spring counts.

(AUDREY GROANS)
We've talked about this.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)


Americans? (CHUCKLES)

(MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CHEERING)

AUDREY: Hey.

Hi.

I hope you're not upset about
what that girl said on the news.

Oh, well,
I'm not that surprised.

It's not like
I've done anything

that impressive with my life.

I've seen you
do some impressive things.

You were a great shot
in the cafe.

You switched
the trophies on me.

You didn't break
when you were being tortured.

Plus you had the foresight
to stick that thing up your...


...thing.


You know, I'm impressed
with you too.

You risked
your whole life for me.

Not many people
would have done that.

Including (CLICKS TONGUE)
my ex-boyfriend.

Yeah, about that.

I wanna clear something up.

You weren't just a cover
for Drew. That much I know.

How?

I was there the night
you two met. At your birthday.

What? At the bar?

Outside,
in the surveillance van.

Drew was in the bar
to take out a target.

Wait, who?
The bartender.

He was a recruiter for ISIS.

Craft bourbon cocktail
with tobacco bitters

and rhubarb zest.

Can you identify him
as the target?

Oops, I'm sorry.
Oh, sorry!

DREW: <i>Happy birthday.</i>

No. Do not get distracted.

<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It's not my birthday.</i>

<i>Oh.</i>
<i>I, um...</i> (CLICKS TONGUE)

<i>I just kind of wear it
for warmth.</i>

DREW: <i>Well, if it was your birthday...</i>
(CHUCKLES) She's funny.

<i>I would say "Happy birthday."</i>

Thayer, get away
from her now.

In our line of work,
being with someone,

caring about them,

it makes our job harder.

So if Drew was trying
with you, then...

That was real.

And not that you
asked my opinion,

but the worst song
on that jukebox is

<i>Your Body Is a Wonderland.</i>

No question.

Oh, my God! What?

What? No way!
Absolutely not. No.


Um, I lost my virginity
to that song.

What?
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

To who? The cheesiest
person in the world?

Oh!

Oh, hey, guys.

Uh, rookworst, am I right?

(MAN GROANING)

(MAN DEFECATING)

It's actually kind of funny.


AUDREY: Oh, my God! Morgan.

She talks too much.

Duffer.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Jesus!

Oh, my God!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Move! Move!


Hands up.

AUDREY: Okay.
That's both hands, cripple.


DUFFER: Come on, Seb. Higher.


Just because I can.

What's this about,
Duffer? Revenge?

I was suspended. You won.

Come on, man. I know I won.

I'm just here for this.

Of course, now I have a few
loose ends to tie up.

(MUFFLED SHOUTING)
Hey! Hey!

Okay! He has nothing
to do with this, okay?

I promise you this is
just Morgan and me.

Why don't you
go back to the CIA,

and tell them that?
DUFFER: Jesus!

You don't know
that I'm the bad guy?

What?

He's not here
on CIA business.

He's working for Highland now.

You have no idea
how much the Chinese mafia's

willing to pay for this.

Or the Russian mafia.
Multiple mafias want this.

And, on that note,

I'll finish you all off
and be on my way.

As much fun as it's been
watching you fucktards play

<i>Tinker Tailor Stoner Spy.</i>

(MUFFLED GRUNT)

(GASPS) Okay, I got it.
That's a joke, Audrey.

It's funny, because I'm funny. You
know what? It doesn't matter.

Because there's one thing
that's mightier than the pen,

and it's called
a fucking handgun!

Oh, my God!
So, for heckling me, Audrey...

Oh, my God. Please don't do this.
Please don't do this.

Duffer, don't do this.

You die first.
SEBASTIAN: Duffer!

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!


(NECK SNAPS)

Oh.

This man, he want
to rob from us, right?

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.
Yes. Absolutely.

MORGAN: Oh, my God! Really, it's scary.
Yes.

AUDREY: How did he find us?

SEBASTIAN: I don't know.
We took every precaution.

We only used cash.

No phones.

Morgan.

Hmm?

Did you call
your parents again?

Yes. I had to.

My father was gonna think
that I was dead

if he found out about Roger.

So I went to a souvenir shop,
I got a burner phone.

I picked it up. One second,
"Hi, I'm alive."

And then I threw it
in the dumpster.

They can't trace a call
if it's less than two minutes.

That's not a thing anymore.
That's not a thing!

Well, I know that now.

Ugh...
(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

He's coming back to life.

He's reanimating.

Okay, it's a phone.
That makes more sense.

It needs a thumbprint.

There's the thumb.
Seriously?

I'm standing,
so I can't do it.

Oh, my God.

AUDREY: Ugh.

It says, "Text me
when you get the package."

Um...

Tell him we have the package,
and ask where the drop is.

Oh, shit.
It's locked again. Hold on.

(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
Oh, oh.

He said, "Bring it
to Operation Albrecht."

Okay.
What's Operation Albrecht?

I'm checking his emails.

Ah.

He's been communicating with
someone named Hunter Pierce.

So a gay porn star.

(AUDREY CHUCKLES)
Uh...

Highland was planning
to buy the drive from Duffer.

They called it
Operation Albrecht.

It's going down
tomorrow night.

There's a gala in Berlin
at the Museum of Technology.

Text him back and say we'll
meet them there with the drive.

The phone is locked again.
I need the thumbprint.

You know what? Forget it.

(AUDREY INHALES SHARPLY)

Okay.
Oh, the thumb! Yes!

Audrey...

(MORGAN GAGGING)
Oh, my God!


(AUDREY GRUNTS)
(BONE SNAPS)

Thumbs up.

Go.
(GRUNTS)

SEBASTIAN: So here's the plan.
We go to Berlin.

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

AUDREY: <i>Wait, we're gonna walk
right into this gala?</i>

SEBASTIAN: <i>No. We pose as
two people on the guest list.</i>

<i>The Canadian ambassador
and his wife.</i>

AUDREY: <i>Uh, won't people know
what they look like?</i>

SEBASTIAN: (CHUCKLES) <i>No.</i>

<i>No one ever remembers
what Canadians look like.</i>

<i>They land at Tegel Airport
at 2:00 p.m.</i>

MORGAN: <i>Can I do an accent?</i>

SEBASTIAN: <i>Please don't.
I know what I'm gonna do.</i>

(IN COCKNEY ACCENT)
Hiya! Is you the Mullicays?

Perfect. I'm Bill.

I know what you're thinking.

How'd a bloke
from the East End

get all the way
to Berlin, Germany?

Well, I will tell you
on the way to the car.

I said, "What are you
doing here, Queen?"

She said, "I was
bored up in that castle.

"I had to get out."

Okay, let's drive then.


No! We're being robbed.

No! Not again.
(BOTH SCREAMING)

Sorry.
MORGAN: Please, no. I've a little girl at home.

Okay. We gotta go!
Me wife is dead.

Go. Get out. They're asleep!
She needs a new kidney.

Morgan, no, let's just...
(IN NORMAL VOICE) I came up with a story.

(CAR LOCK BEEPS)

(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(TRAIN HORN HONKING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

AUDREY: I hope I look like
the Canadian ambassador's wife.

I hope I look like Chris
Kirkpatrick from NSYNC.

Am I done?
MORGAN: Yeah. You're good.

I just think if one of us is
changing her look,

then the other
should change her look

for disguise reasons.

Like, you're about to look
like Amanda Mullicay.

And I'm about to look like...

Shit. I'm about
to look like you.

Not that it's a bad look.
It's just we switched places,

so if they're looking
for a blonde and a brunette,

then we're still gonna be
a blonde and a brunette.

Oh, we fucked up.

I hope this isn't
what gets us killed tonight.

No. Hey, we're
not gonna die tonight.

You're right, we're not.
But if we do...

We're not, but if we do...
Oh, my God.

I know a lot of horrific stuff
has happened this week,

but, um...

It has been
the best week of my life.

Really?
Yeah, just being out here, like,

on this adventure, with you,

doing the right thing,
and nobody's judging me...

I don't know.

Do you normally feel judged?

You know that thing
that Drew said to me

about me being a little much?

It's not the first time
I've heard that.

You're not "a little much."

I am. I am "a little much."
I'm a lot much.

No, you're not.

The only people
who don't think so

are you and my parents.

That's 'cause
everyone else is boring.


Sorry.

I'm so proud of you.

Honey, I'm proud of you.

(BOTH SNIFFLING)

Oh, my God.

MORGAN: So, don't...
AUDREY: Don't die, okay?

MORGAN: Please don't die,
because then I would die,

and then we would both be dead,
and that would be a waste.

(OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Morgan.
Are you in position?

Yeah, I was born in position.

Yes, everyone's
born in position.

That's why they call it
the fetal position.

Right. Yeah, I just got that.


Amanda.
Ethan.

Just act natural.
Just another normal night.

Yeah.

MORGAN: <i>Performing with
Cirque du Soleil</i>

<i>is actually a top three
dream of mine.</i>

I'm highly prepared
for this mission.

I was a C.I.T. in Acrobatics
and Clowning at camp.

It was competitive
and I excelled.

Once again, Morgan, you're not
performing with the troupe.

Your job is to stay backstage
and watch the surveillance.

<i>We need to locate the buyer.</i>

Okay. But... But...

Not just for one song?

SEBASTIAN: <i>No.</i>
I hear you.

But wouldn't I be better able
to identify the mark

if I was spinning around on
that silver spinning thingy?

SEBASTIAN: <i>No.</i>
Copy that.

But what if
I was on the trapeze?

In which I am trained.

No.
<i>Affirmative.</i>

Mongoose standing down.


Hey!

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

PERFORMERS: Hey!

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

MORGAN: <i>You guys, you guys,
I see someone suspicious.</i>

Okay. Stay calm.

<i>Can you describe them?</i>
Okay.

He's got an insane
twirly mustache.

<i>He's got the big bushy
scary eyebrows.</i>

And... (SCOFFS)

Yep. Yep.
He's holding a bag of money.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have our buyer.</i>

Yeah, I think that guy's
part of the show.

Yeah, Morgan, I don't think
an actual bad guy

would look like
an evil Mr. Monopoly.

MORGAN: <i>I don't know.</i>

I gotta go with my gut
on this. I'm sorry.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh.

(ALL CHEERING)

And I was mistaken.
He is a part of the show.

I repeat,
he is a part of the show.

What?
That's Tom and Marsha.

Drew's fake parents.
Or whoever they are.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Morgan, get backstage.
I've been blown.

(MORGAN GIGGLES)

Who has blown you?

Morgan, it's not funny.

<i>I agree. There's nothing funny
about you being blown.</i> (GIGGLING)

SEBASTIAN:
<i>Okay. You two, stay together</i>

and in plain sight
until I get back.

You, uh... You put the drive
somewhere safe?

Very safe.

Is it the same place
as last time?

You'll see.

I don't actually mean,
like, you'll see.

Please just go.
Yeah.

Okay.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

AUDREY: Sebastian...

Sebastian, you got a text.

Sebastian, is everything okay?

Morgan, Sebastian's
not responding.

MORGAN: <i>Oh, my God!
That's really bad.</i>

Or not. I don't wanna scare
you. Could mean anything.

The buyer texted me.
I have to go meet him.

Or her.
<i>Thank you. I was gonna say,</i>

women can be terrorists too.

<i>We can do anything
we put our minds to.</i>

Can you see if you can
get eyes on Sebastian?

He couldn't have gotten far.

Okay.

Yeah. In that case,

I am gonna climb
the ladder. I know...


Morgan?

...trapeze platform really
is the best vantage point.

Morgan!


(GUN COCKS)

Audrey. Oh, my God!

What the fuck?

Okay.

Okay.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

Audrey, the goldfinch

her very precarious perch.

I think I'm about,
I don't know,

2,000 feet off the ground.

Huh.

No.

(MORGAN GASPS)

Okay. I'm gonna go. Wait.

What? Excuse me.

Give me the ladder.

Fuck me.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

Drew, you're supposed to be dead.
Dead. Yeah.

I was right on the edge.

But the idea of you being
out there kept me alive.

I'm here to save you.

Me?
And to stop Henshaw.

What? Sebastian?
No, he's helping us.

Audrey, do you know
about Highland?

Yeah.

Sebastian works for Highland.

No. That's not possible.

Why would he come
and risk his life?

Why would he get fired?

What did he tell you?
Did he tell you

you're here to find
a buyer for the drive?

You're just here
so he can kill me.

He was using you
as bait to find me.

He knew that
I'd come back for you.

That I'd never
let him hurt you.

And now, here I am.

Yeah.

Audrey, I have some bad news.

Nadedja is still alive,

and she is on the other
trapeze platform

right now.

She might have a bomb on her.
I don't know.

Maybe this is one
of the terrorist attacks.

That doesn't really
make any sense.

She doesn't seem
like a suicide bomber.

That girl has
high self-esteem.

She's so full of herself.

The point is, Audrey,
I'm looking at her,

and she definitely
does wanna kill me.

And then she's gonna
come after you.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

So I think I gotta fix this.

That I wouldn't grow?
That I wouldn't go anywhere?

Did you send me to Vienna
because you just

assumed that I wouldn't
question anything?

No. No. No, no. I mean...

I underestimated you.

You hurt me.

I'm so sorry.

I had to.

But now, seeing everything
that you've done,

I've never loved you more.

Do you love me?

I love you, Audrey Stockman.

DREW: Canadian now?

Eh! (LAUGHS)
Eh! Good.

Oh, um... I wouldn't open that.
Is that gonna blow my head off?

AUDREY: Hmm?

Thousand guesses, never
would've landed on "thumb."


Anything else, Double O Sexy?

The drive isn't in there.


Oh, come on.

Hey.

You can trust me.

Really? 'Cause you said
not to trust anyone.

TOM: Stand back!
MARSHA: Go on. Move it.

Sebastian?

Audrey.
Audrey, step back. He's with them.

Thayer?
Hey, bro.

Audrey, step away from him.

He's gonna kill all of us.

He said the same thing
about you.

Hello.

Thayer,
remove the target.

Fuck you, Dad.

(GROANS)
(AUDREY GASPS)

(MARSHA GROANS)

Mom.


Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait!
Wait! Hold on. Hold on.

Audrey, listen to me. Drew
is working with Highland.

Sebastian was working
with Highland.

SEBASTIAN: That's a lie.

Audrey, he was working
with Duffer too.

Sebastian was
working with Duffer.

SEBASTIAN: Drew's the one that sent
the assassin to the gymnasium.

He would've let you die.

DREW: Sebastian sent the
assassin to the gymnasium.

Sebastian would've let you die.

Okay, everything I say you did
you can't just say I did.

I can 'cause
I've got the gun.



You okay?

I'm so scared.

It's all right. It's okay.


I'm so sorry
I dragged you into this.

AUDREY: It's okay. It's okay.
DREW: I know.

Can we please just go home?

Yeah.
Okay.

I'm gonna take care of you.

You looking for this?

Uh, Audrey, that's...

That's cute, but I don't think
you know what you're doing.

God, you really do
still underestimate me.

Audrey, come on.

Audrey...

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Get off me! No!

Oh, my God!

Oh, Morgan.
Always so dramatic.

(LAUGHS)
(GRUNTS)

DREW: Fuck!

Oh, God!


Argh!


You better hurry.

Finish me off.

Oh, that's right.

You never finish anything.

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

To quote a text I got,

"Hey there.
It's over. Sorry."

Audrey... Audrey, don't.

(GUN CLICKS)

I lied.

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

(DOOR OPENS)

(OFFICER SPEAKING GERMAN)

OFFICER:
Drew Thayer, don't move.

You're under arrest.

DISPATCHER: (ON RADIO) <i>We
have apprehended Drew Thayer.</i>

It's a little much,
don't you think?

Oh, my God! Are you okay?

I'm okay. Are you okay?
AUDREY: Yeah.


Sebastian?


(AUDREY GASPS)

What the fuck?

Okay, these vests,
they save your life,

but they do not prevent you
from breaking ribs.

MORGAN: You're alive.

(MORGAN KISSING)
(SEBASTIAN GROANING)

Oh, you're alive.

(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)

(CLINKS MUG)

What is
the Heimlich maneuver?

WOMAN: (ON TV) <i>What is
the Heimlich maneuver?</i>

ALEX TREBEK: <i>That's it.</i>
WOMAN: <i>Instruments for eight.</i>

(CELL PHONE RINGING)
<i>This long, powerful horn...</i>

That's a long number.

Oh.

Hello.

Mom, I'm alive.
CAROL: <i>Honey, are you okay?</i>

Let me turn this down.

Yeah, I'm gonna
put you on speaker.

BOTH: Hold on.
ARNIE: <i>Let me turn the volume down.</i>

Put in... Do... Um...
ARNIE: <i>Trying to lower the volume, sweetie,</i>

and I can't.
CAROL: Input.

Input?
I don't see input.

<i>Sorry, I'm calling</i>

from an international
spy's phone.

Spy. Who's a spy?

Yeah, input's
doing nothing.

He's an international spy,

and his name is
Sebastian Henshaw.

(CHUCKLES)
MORGAN: He works for MI6.

Morgan...

Can she not reveal
my identity?

Uh, yeah,
she tells them everything.

MORGAN: Hold on.
I have a call waiting.

I love you.

Sebastian Henshaw's phone.
This is Morgan speaking.

WENDY: <i>Where's Henshaw?</i>

Oh, my God.
Is this who I think it is?

How could I possibly know
who you think this is?

MORGAN: <i>Oh, my God.
It is you. Wow.</i>

I'm letting
Audrey and Sebastian

have a little bit
of a moment right now.

<i>You know what I mean?</i>

Tell him to call me back.
<i>No, no. It's okay.</i>

I think I've proven myself
a trustworthy junior agent.

<i>Why don't you give me
the message, yeah?</i>

Okay.
Okay.

<i>You may tell him this,</i>

that he can come back
to the office on Monday.

Really? Oh, my gosh!
That's the best.

Thank you.
<i>He's gonna be so happy.</i>

<i>Thank you so much.</i>

Mon... Oh! Monday is
tough for me though.

<i>Okay.</i>
No, no, no.

I have a callback
for a Progresso commercial.

But you know what? Fuck it!

<i>I'm gonna cancel it.</i>
I'm not talking about you, Morgan.

Do not show up on Monday.
<i>Okay.</i>

I won't come in on Monday. Gosh, I
wouldn't dream of it. (CHUCKLES)

Great. Thank you.

<i>No, but I will.
I'll see you Monday.</i>

What do you like
in your coffee?

SEBASTIAN:
So when people ask you

about your first trip
to Europe...

I'm gonna have to tell them the truth.

It definitely wasn't boring.

No.

But I didn't get to do
everything that I wanted to do.

Oh, yeah?
What did you forget?

No. (GROANS) No, no.
(GASPS)

Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. I
thought that you and I maybe...

No. Actually it was...
I'm sorry.

I was going for the...
I mean, it was the physical

pain of my chest.
Okay, then suck it up.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Hey.

All for this happening.
Love this.

I'm sorry to interrupt.

I just talked
to the MI6 lady,

and she said that you would
know what to do with the drive?

I have it this time.

You told us to keep it
somewhere safe.

Right. So I finally
swallowed it.

Big personal
victory of mine.

Well, we need to destroy it.

Yeah. As soon as she clears.

You know what I mean?


I, um... I should
speak to my boss.

Yep. Bye now.

Ahhh!

(LAUGHS)
(MORGAN VOCALIZING)

What? Okay!
Okay!

Yes, yes, yes!
Yes, yes, yes!
