Huangshi's Kid

How about playing basketball later?

Are you nuts?

Maybe.

I used to be on a boat

I'm sympathetic to you, man

but I have to stay healthy

I'm marrying on Tuesday

Congratulations

So, I have to be back
to Nanjing on time

I'm the driver of
the Red Cross

Really?

You are going to Nanjing

Yeah, I'll start two days
before the wedding

Let's have a drink together

Great

I have a good idea

ok

I told you,

journalists can't
go to Nanjing

So just ask the Japanese

They are the master now

Bath, this is my best friend,

Endilis, he came here
to visit his love

I'm Jiashlong

Hello

This is Captain Lujibath,

the bitch of British consular

I met Mr. Fet before

Excuse me, help yourselves

His girlfriend,

they will get married Tuesday.

He won't come back on Tuesday

He would go to
hill tomorrow morning

You son of a bitch, you are the
one who gave him the passport.

Fuck you, how long we
have been friends?

Please forgive me, Mr. Aps

He is not a journalist.

He is a member of Red Cross,
so he could get the passport.

We need the passport to Anji

since we are the member
of Red Cross.

We can finally go to
Nanjing, Baers.

Trust me

I'm Endis, you are Felibaks.

We are drivers for the Red Cross.

You send the
medicine to Nanjing.

For this,

Endis wants to get married.

If you do this, we
can help all of them.

God, are you crazy.

Eide.

Eide.

Eide is over there.

Who's that?

I know who he is.

Why'd he come here?

He's going to Nanjing as well.

Just keep your watch
one hours ahead.

Now we should use
the Tokyo zone.

Do you know what
Tokyo speak in Japanese?

They are here to help Chinese.

They said that Chinese
is disordered.

Ride, military, and the fight.

They came here
to help you Chinese.

Nonsense.

They are not against China.

I told you why they
do not try to straight a war

if they don't do that

they can capture
Chinese people as they wish

and they can do anything
without be blamed

Japanese are not barbarians

But they thought others are

See

So many people

They are coming from Nanjing

World War II begins

place called Huangshi

in the west

while you get yourself cured

and you can improve
your Chinese

and then go to the front line

Well-known university
academics Niujin

George pig

I'm the master here

Mr. Pig

The letter said pig

you know how to write

I'm not like those farmers

My name is bovine Kai Shi my
father is a government official

what is he looking for

Probably looking for food

are you kidding me

Hello

you think I have food
just because I have a pan

come and look

they want food, but I
have nothing

see

I have rice with pest

sir, where's teachers,
where are they

they have gone, all of them

do you have rice

what are they doing

I don't know

get up, hurry

come on

hurry up

Who's there

Ms Li

the kids want to hurt sir

Stop

if you touch him

I will leave here

and I would never come back

He is to frighten you

just tell me, Sikai

why I do that

why are they acting
like monsters

How long have you
been to China

5 weeks

how about you

Five years

come here, let me have a look

you are that nurse Li

Phillips

Hello, My name is George

I know who you are

Let you come here is my idea

Children haven't had such
a good m for a long time

Outstanding Niujin
university academics

Haisheng introduce you to us

but, he call you Mr Pig

that is not funny

here it is

out of my way, what are you doing

that kid is very thin

he is very impressive

He saw his father was beheaded

Sister and mother were raped

And then beheaded

Japanese drive him and many people
rushed to the edge of mass graves

Ready to kill them

He had escaped by
pretending to be dead

ok, don't say that

I've been there while
these happened

Hansheng told me, so
he told you to come here

and give you a Chinese name

so the kid can remember you

my name is Heke

stop that, I won't stay here

I came here

not to be the
babysitter for these kids

OK

tell me how to go to
the front line, I can go myself

as you wish

why they help you

everyday, people die of cold

Arbitrary or breaking cold

I would tell them
if they keep running

maybe you just feel inch first

but you would have a
fever next day

if you don't care

your bone would pain

and you can't open your mouth

and you teeth would hold
tight, and you would die slowly

I have the bag with
the Royal anti-drug needles

if I go, they
don't have the medicine

so who would play with me

so, why don't
they close the school

just let the kids
go back to home

This is not a school

It seemed like a schools

This is an orphanage

every child here has
the experience as Kai Shi

don't you want to collect
information on the war?

we got all the
information you want

they don't need a teacher

but one who take care for them

Bed is full of lice

so do the kids

they are so lovely

Those who have
lice infection typhoid

ok

they should be disinfected

How to disinfect them

by hot water

Good idea

Louse powder, they don't
want to use that

But the problem is let them
know that this will not pain

You can find a way

Heke has lice

Grasp

These lice let him sick

See this louse
powder to kill lice

But he will not hurt

Laugh

Very happy Heke

take off your clothes

why are you
embracing, hurry up

what is he doing, hurry up

Hand

don't go

slowly

Beat him

we won't cut your hairs
off if you have no louse

Can you guarantee that?

Not so vain, Mr Pig

I'm not

what's this

Coffee

Coffee

drike

this is the first couple of
coffee when I left Shanghai

why you came to China

as China is in trouble

Everybody is waiting for the
arrival of voice upstairs blood

Waiting for the next war

Like it was in a cellar
waiting for the arrival of storm

I went to the United
States first

Take two cars across
the United States

Americans hided in their bed

the British were even worse

War

What kind of war, sir

the Great Depression comes

Later, I went to japan,

where I learned Japanese

Japanese tell you they want war

if you don't believe
me, just ask them

Then to the Nanjing

it was horrible

I killed people just for
help some innocent people

I never know that I
have so much hatred

Everyone would hate
them, don't blame yourself

But, we shouldn't

My whole family are pacifists

They are not as
good as you thought

Not really

They are famous

Handi together with
my mother drinks tea

My father in the war
when peace Zunguo prison

Sometimes I think
we must use force

In the war at
the expense of others
