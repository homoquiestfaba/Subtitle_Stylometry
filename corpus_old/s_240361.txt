<i>Everyone is born.</i>
<i>But not everyone is born the same.</i>

<i>Some will grow to be butchers,</i>
<i>or bakers or candlestick makers.</i>

<i>Some will only be good</i>
<i>at making Jell-O salad.</i>

<i>But every human being is unique,</i>
<i>for better or forworse.</i>

<i>Most parents think their children</i>
<i>are the most beautiful things alive.</i>

<i>- Others are less emotional.</i>
What a waste of time.

$9.25 for a bar of soap!
I had to take a shower.

$5,000! I'm not paying it!
They can't repossess the kid!

There's no way out.
Make a U-turn.

Harry!

<i>Harry and Zinnia Wormwood</i>
<i>lived in a very nice neighbourhood.</i>

<i>But they were not nice people.</i>

Get out of the street, you dodos!

<i>The Wormwoods were so busy,</i>
<i>they forgot they had a daughter.</i>

<i>If they had paid her any attention,</i>
<i>they'd have seen she was special.</i>

Oh, my gosh! Matilda!
Now look what you did!

You're supposed to <i>eat</i> the spinach!

Babies...
You're better off raising tomatoes!

<i>At two, Matilda had already</i>
<i>learned how to take care of herself.</i>

<i>As time went by,</i>
<i>she developed a sense of style.</i>

<i>Every morning,</i>
<i>Matilda's brotherwent to school.</i>

<i>Her fatherwent to work.</i>
<i>Selling used cars for unfair prices.</i>

<i>- Her mother took off to play Bingo.</i>
Soup's on the stove...

<i>Matilda was left alone.</i>

<i>That was how she liked it.</i>

<i>At four. She had read</i>
<i>every magazine in the house.</i>

<i>One night. She asked her father for</i>
<i>something she desperately wanted.</i>

A book? Why do you want a book?
To read.

Why would you want to read,
when the television is right there?

You get more out of watching TV.
Get out of the way.

<i>Matilda already knew</i>
<i>she was different from her family.</i>

<i>She saw that whatever she needed.</i>
<i>She'd have to get herself.</i>

There's fish fingers
in the microwave.

There's fish fingers
in the microwave.

<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>Matilda set off in search of a book.</i>

Where are the children's books?
In that room.

Would you like me to pick out one?
No, thank you. I can manage.

<i>From then on, every day,</i>
<i>Matilda walked to the library.</i>

<i>She devoured one book after another.</i>

<i>When she finished all the children's</i>
<i>books. She searched for others.</i>

<i>Mrs. Phelps, who had been</i>
<i>watching herwith fascination, -</i>

<i>- offered Matilda some information.</i>

You can have your own library card,
and take books home.

You can take as many as you like.
That would be wonderful.

<i>Matilda's strong mind continued</i>
<i>to grow, nurtured by the authors -</i>

<i>- who had sent their books out into</i>
<i>the world, like ships onto the sea.</i>

<i>The books gave Matilda a comforting</i>
<i>message: You are not alone.</i>

Did any packages come today?

Where did all this come from?
The library.

The library? You're only four!
6...

Then you'd be in school already.

I was supposed to start school
in September. You wouldn't listen.

Get up.

Give me that book!

How old is Matilda?
Four.

I'm 6... I was six in August.
You're a liar.

I want to go to school.
Who'd sign for the packages?

We can't leave valuable packages
on the doorstep. Go watch TV.

There's something wrong with her.
Tell me about it.

Hey, dipface! Have a marshmallow.
Have another!

Dipface!

<i>Matilda longed for a friend,</i>
<i>like the kind people in her books.</i>

<i>It occurred to her that</i>
<i>talking dragons and princesses -</i>

<i>- might exist only in story books.</i>

<i>But she was about to discover she</i>
<i>had a strength she didn't know of.</i>

<i>But she was about to discover she</i>
<i>had a strength she didn't know of.</i>

I'm great! I'm incredible!
Michael, pencil and paper.

Did we sell some cars today?
Did we!

Can I get that new TV?
Yeah!

It's time you learned the family
business. Write this down.

The first car I sold cost $320.
I sold it for $1.158.

The second one cost $512.
I sold it for $2.269!

You're going too fast.
Just write. The third cost $68.

I sold it for $999.
The fourth cost $1.100.

I sold it for
7,839 big American boffos!

What was my profit for the day?
$10.265.

Check it if you don't believe me.

You saw the paper.
From all the way over here?

Are you being smart with me?

If you are, you'll be punished.
Punished for being smart?

When a person is bad, that person
has to be taught a lesson.

Person?
Get up!

<i>Harry had unintentionally given</i>
<i>his daughter some practical advice.</i>

<i>He meant to say, "child".</i>
<i>Instead, he said, "person".</i>

<i>Thereby, he introduced the idea that</i>
<i>children could punish their parents.</i>

<i>Only when they deserved it.</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

Michael, come into my room!

What?
I'll take you to work today, okay?

I don't know. What do you think?
I think appearance is important.

People don't buy a car. They buy me.
So I take pride in my appearance.

Well-oiled hair. Clean shave...
Get ready for a big day of learning.

There's a sucker born every minute.
We'll take them for all they've got.

Give me the cookies.
Here.

Okay, my boy! Heir to the throne!
Today we diddle the customers.

What are you looking at?

Lovekins, where's my breakfast?
Here we are, my heartstrings...

Snickerdoodle.
What did you do to your hair?

My hair?

Give me those things.
Get in the car.

Get in.

<i>Dirty dealings, like buying</i>
<i>stolen car parts, never stay secret.</i>

<i>Especially when the FBI</i>
<i>gets involved.</i>

9:17. Subject exits domicile.
I've got 9:18.

9:17 is correct.

One day, all this will be yours.
This?

See thisjunker? I paid $100 for it.
She's got 120,000 miles on her.

Transmission's shot.
Bumpers are falling off...

What do I do with her?
I sell her!

We should weld these bumpers on,
but that takes time and money.

So we use Super Super Glue instead.

Go ahead. Put it on there.
Won't it fall off?

Isn't that dangerous?
Not to me. Okay? Transmission!

The sawdust lets the engine run
sweet as a nut. For a few miles.

Daddy, that's cheating.
Nobody ever got rich being honest.

20 years ago, we could turn
the numbers back by hand.

But the Feds like to test the
ingenuity of American businessmen.

Two-directional drill. If you run it
backwards, the numbers go down.

Cool!

Daddy, you're a crook.
What?

This is illegal.
Here, keep drilling.

Do you make money?
Don't people need good cars?

Can't you sell good cars?

I'm smart, you're dumb.
I'm right, you're wrong!

There's nothing you can do about it.

Harry, I won!
I hit the double bingo!

I'm taking you all to Cafe Le Ritz!

Let me see the money!

Your hair looks awful!
I hope they'll let you in.

Here's your hat, Daddy.
Get in the car.

How much?
It's for me to know.

You never take us out.
I took you to The Flipper.

There was a comb in the soup.
Oh, yeah! I like thatjoint.

This way, please.
Harry, take your hat off.

I can't.
You can't wear a hat inside.

I can't take it off.
Nobody cares about your hair.

I can't get it off.

I'm gonna get this hat off.

I think your head swelled up.

You're pulling the skin!
You're such a baby!

The fibres are fused to the head!
What's that supposed to mean?

I will not be a figure of ridicule!
I want respect!

I still don't see
how you glued your hat on, Harry.

I did not glue my hat to my head!
The fibres fused to my hair!

Baby, wait a minute!
I'm getting it now.

Oh, my God!

From now on, this family does
exactly what I say, when I say it!

Here's your hat.

Right now, we are eating dinner
and watching TV.

<i>Are you ready to get sticky</i>
<i>with Mickey?</i>

<i>Are you ready to get sticky</i>
<i>with Mickey?</i>

Shut your light off.

<i>For those idiots who don't know</i>
<i>how to play, here's how it goes.</i>

<i>For each correct answer, you'll move</i>
<i>one step closer to our cube of cash!</i>

<i>Any money that sticks to your</i>
<i>gooey body, you get to take home!</i>

Hi. Dad.
Are you in this family?

Hello. Are you in this family?

What is this trash you're reading?

It's lovely. It's "Moby Dick",
by Herman Melville.

Moby what?
This is filth!

It's a library book!
I'm fed up with all this reading!

You're a Wormwood! Act like one!
Sit up and look at the TV!

<i>Get real sticky</i>
<i>and get cash for free.</i>

<i>Let's get sticky!</i>

I didn't do it.
Of course not, you little twit!

I told you that was a cheap set.
It's not cheap, it's stolen.

Put your light on!

<i>Was it magic, or coincidence?</i>

<i>We only use</i>
<i>a tiny portion of our brains.</i>

<i>The events of the following day</i>
<i>made Matilda discover her strength.</i>

I need a car. Can you service me?
Yes. Welcome to Wormwood Motors.

Harry Wormwood, owner and founder.
Agatha Trunchbull, Principal.

I want a tight car,
because I run a tight ship.

My school is a model of discipline.
"Use the rod. Beat the child."

Do you have brats?

A boy, Mikey, and one mistake.
They're all mistakes, children.

I'm glad I never was one.
I'm gonna make you a great deal.

You had better.

Thank you. Enjoy it.

Thank you. Enjoy it.

Hey, you.
You're going to school.

You'll get a real education
at this place.

<i>Matilda had always wanted</i>
<i>to go to school.</i>

<i>She tried to imagine</i>
<i>what her new school would be like.</i>

<i>She pictured a lovely building,</i>
<i>surrounded by trees and flowers.</i>

<i>There was a building. And children!</i>

<i>Regardless of how the school looked,</i>
<i>she was happy to be there.</i>

<i>After all, any school is better</i>
<i>than no school at all. Isn't it?</i>

You... detention.

You're too small. Grow up quicker!

Heads up! Shoulders back!

Sorry.
It's better than being out there.

Is that my teacher?
No, that's the principal.

The principal likes to snap a whip
in here to see who's hiding.

I'm Matilda.
Lavender.

I'm Hortensia.
Does she really hit children?

No. What she does is worse.
Like yesterday, in the second grade.

She makes weekly visits to show
the teachers how to handle kids.

Julius ate two M&Ms.
And she caught him?

Julius ate two M&Ms.
And she caught him?

Of course!

Was Julius okay?
He lived, if that's what you mean.

She used to be in the Olympics.
Shot-put, javelin, hammer throw.

So she does this all the time?

It's better than the Chokey.
Chokey?

It's a tall hole in the wall.
A drippy pipe with jagged edges.

The walls have nails sticking out.

Get in, you festering bowl of pus!

I've been in there twice.

Didn't you tell your parents?
Would your parents believe it?

You must obey Miss Trunchbull.

No. Here she comes!

Ah! Fresh meat!

Amanda Thripp.
Yes. Miss Trunchbull.

What are those...
hanging down by your ears?

You mean my pigtails?
Are you a pig?

No. Miss Trunchbull.
Do I allow pigs in my school?

My mommy thinks they're sweet.
Your mommy is a twit!

Chop them off by tomorrow, or...
But...

But?
Did you say "but"?

Hammer throw.
Definitely.

I'll give you "but".

Good loft!
Excellent release!

Think she'll make the fence?

Get to class before I throw you all
in the Chokey.

Lavender, what's my teacher like?
Run. Run. Run!

Faster! Get in!

<i>Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey,</i>
<i>was one of those people -</i>

<i>- who appreciates every child</i>
<i>forwho she or he is.</i>

I scooped these up for you.
How lovely. Thank you, Amanda.

We have a new student with us today.

This is Matilda Wormwood.
I'd like you to sit with Lavender.

You all know how scary the first day
of school is. So be nice to Matilda.

Could you get her workbook, please?
You can sit down.

<i>Miss Honey was a wonderful teacher.</i>

<i>But her life was not as beautiful</i>
<i>as it seemed. She had a dark secret.</i>

<i>Though it caused her pain, it didn't</i>
<i>interfere with her teaching.</i>

You've come on a good day. We're
going to review what we've learned.

If you know an answer,
just raise your hand.

We've been working on our times
tables. Who'd like to demonstrate?

Let's do some together.

2 x 4 is?
8.

2 x 6 is?
12.

2 x 9 is?
18.

Soon you'll be able to do them all,
whether it's 2 x 7...

14.
Or 13 x 379.

4,927.

I beg your pardon?
I think that's the answer.

13 x 379 is 4.927.

It is.
Wow...

You can multiply big numbers?
I read a book on mathematics.

You like to read?
Yes. I love to read.

What do you like to read?
I've been reading Darls Chickens.

Charles Dickens.
I could read him every day.

So could I.

All right, take out your workbooks
and let's start with section three.

I'll be back in a moment.

Gotcha! Right in the neck.

Come in.

Almost got you.

Good to see you, Jen.

Time for one of our
little heart-to-hearts?

It's about the new girl in my class,
Matilda Wormwood.

Her father says she's a real wart.

A carbuncle. A blister.
A pustule of malignant ooze.

Matilda is sweet and very bright.
A bright child?

She can multiply large sums.
So can a calculator.

I think she might be happier
in an older and more advanced class.

You can't handle the little viper,
so you're trying to get rid of her.

No...
Typical, slothful cowardice!

The distance the shot-put goes
depends on your effort.

If you can't handle the little brat,
I'II lock her in the Chokey!

Get it?
Yes. Ma'am.

Everything I do
is for your own good.

And the good of
those putrescent, little children!

Mom. I'm home.
<i>- How was school?</i>

I get to do sixth grade work.
Hold on a minute.

Can't you see I'm on the phone?
You just asked me how school was.

The baby wasn't his.
Well, it was really great.

No way. They have to be implants.
The principal is insane.

She threw a girl over the fence.
You should wax yours, too.

I have the most wonderful teacher.

Mine are driving me crazy.
Six hours at school is not enough.

I'll say.

Awhack to the belly.
A smack to the face. Burns is hurt.

Saved by the bell.

Packages at this hour?
Come here.

Hello.
We don't give money, charity...

I'm Jennifer Honey.
I'm Matilda's teacher.

What's she done now?
You! Go to your room, right now!

She's your problem now.
There is no problem.

Then beat it. We're watching TV.

If a TV show is more important than
Matilda, you shouldn't be a parent.

Turn it off and listen to me.

Come on in. Get this over with.
Mrs. Wormwood won't like this.

Close the door.
Who is it?

Some teacher.

What did you do that for?
What do you want?

Matilda has a brilliant mind.
Yeah, right. Give me a beer.

Her math skills are extraordinary.
Do you want one?

No thank you. She's reading material
that I didn't see until college.

College!

With private instruction, she'd be
ready for college in a few years.

A girl does not get anywhere
by acting intelligent.

Look at you and me.
You chose books. I chose looks.

I have a nice house and a husband.
You teach children their ABC's.

You want Matilda to go to college?

I didn't go to college.
I don't know anybody who did.

A bunch of hippies
and cesspool salesmen.

Don't sneer at educated people.

If you became ill, your doctor
would be a college graduate.

If you were sued, your lawyer
would have gone to college, too.

Sued by who?
Who have you been talking to?

Nobody.

I can see
we're not going to agree. Are we?

I'm sorry
I burst in on you like this.

We ought to sue her
for interrupting our show.

Why's he standing in the middle?
Because it's over.

Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

Who won?
I don't know. You shut it off.

<i>The entire school will go</i>
<i>to the assembly room immediately!</i>

<i>The entire school will go</i>
<i>to the assembly room immediately!</i>

Sit!

What's up?
Beats me.

Bruce Bogtrotter.

Would little Brucey come up here?

He lives on my block.

This boy, Bruce Bogtrotter,
is a vicious sneak thief.

You're a disgusting criminal.
What are you talking about?

Chocolate cake.

You slithered like a serpent
into the kitchen and ate my snack!

Do you deny it?

Confess!

I can't remember a specific cake.
This one was mine.

It was the best cake in the world.
My mom's is better.

How can you be sure
unless you have another piece?

Sit down, Bog.

Here we go.
Smells chocolatey, eh?

Now. Eat it!

I don't want any. Thank you.

Eat it!

Don't eat it.

She wouldn't give him cake.
It's poison.

You look like you enjoyed that.
Yes. Ma'am.

You must have some more.
No thanks.

But you'll hurt the cook's feelings.

She made this cakejust for you.

Her sweat and blood
went into this cake.

You will not leave this platform
until you have eaten the whole cake!

The whole cake! See you at lunch.
Thank you, Cookie.

You wanted cake, you got cake.
Now eat it!

Poor Brucey.

He's going to puke.

I can't look. Is he going to puke?
Without a doubt.

Bruce looks real bad.
Give up?

You can do it, Brucey!

Yeah, you can do it!

Go. Bruce!

Silence!

Silence!

Stop! Silence!

The entire assembly
will stay five hours after school!

Any children who object will go
straight into the Chokey. Together!

<i>Code R's the official way of saying</i>
<i>we've caught a bad one.</i>

Where were you?
Miss Trunchbull kept us late.

That's a lie! The packages were left
outside because you weren't here.

You get all this stuff from
catalogues and I don't get anything!

It's car parts. It's business.

Why isn't it sent to the office?
The cops are watching the office.

The cops are watching the house.

They're parked outside, right now.
Those are speedboat salesmen.

Really nice guys.
Cops.

Speedboats?
There are no lakes around here.

Some people go away on weekends.
And some people are cops.

They're not cops!
Go to bed, you lying little earwig!

<i>With the FBI watching her father,</i>
<i>and the Trunchbull at school. - </i>

<i>- it was a rare moment when Matilda</i>
<i>couldjust play.</i>

Afrog! Afrog! Afrog!

What is it. Lavender?
Afrog!

It's a salamander.
It's a chameleon.

"Any of the semiaquatic salamanders
from the genus triturus."

"Some are brightly coloured
and secrete irritating substances."

Useless, flaming car!

Wormwood! Sell me a lemon!

You're heading for the Chokey!
Teach you a lesson!

You and your father think
you can make a fool out of me!

I'm nothing like my father!
You're the spitting image!

The apple never rots
far from the tree!

Miss Honey!
Trunchbull is teaching our class.

She'll be here any second!

Make sure the water is cold.
Cover the fish!

Put away the art projects.

<i>Most great ideas</i>
<i>come from careful planning.</i>

<i>But sometimes.</i>
<i>Theyjustjump out at you.</i>

Last time, you forgot yourselves.
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.

Don't laugh. Don't breathe loudly.
Don't breathe at all.

Good morning, Miss Trunchbull.

Sit!

Shoo.

I don't understand
why children are so disgusting.

They're like insects.

They should be got rid of.

The perfect school is one in which
there are no children.

Do you agree, Miss Honey?

You! Front of the class!

Are you okay?

Next time I tell you
to empty your pockets, do it faster!

This could be the most
interesting thing you've ever done.

Sit down, you squirming worm!

Get up!

Can you spell?
We can spell "difficulty".

You can't spell "difficulty".
She taught us with a poem.

How sweet. What poem is that?

Mrs. D. Mrs. I.
Mrs. F. F. I.

Mrs. C. Mrs. U.
Mrs. L. T. Y.

Why are all these women married?
You teach spelling, not poetry!

Why do small children
take so long to grow up?

They do it deliberately,
just to annoy me.

What's funny?

Spit it out! I like ajoke
as well as the next fat person.

It's a snake!

It's a snake!

One of you tried to poison me. Who?

Matilda! I knew it.

It's not a snake. It's a newt.
What did you say?

It's a newt. Miss Trunchbull.
Stand up! You did this.

No. Miss Trunchbull.
Did you have accomplices?

I didn't do it!
You thought you'd pay me back?

Well, I'II pay you back.
For what. Miss Trunchbull?

For this newt, you pissworm!
I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

Anyway, I'm big and you're small,
I'm right and you're wrong.

There's nothing you can do about it.
You're a liar and a scoundrel.

Your father is a cheat! You're the
most corrupt low-lifes in history!

Am I wrong? I'm never wrong.

In this classroom. In this school,
I am God!

You!
I didn't move!

You did this.
She was sitting way over here.

I'll be watching you.
Each and every one.

When you turn the corner,
when you get your smelly coats.

When you skip merrily to lunch.
I'll be watching you. All of you.

And especially you!

Thanks for not telling.
Best friends don't tell.

She can really dance.

I'm gonna clean up this mess.
I'll be out there in a minute.

Miss Honey...
Yes. Matilda?

I did it.
Did what?

I made the glass tip over.
Don't let her make you feel bad.

It was an accident.
I did it with my eyes. Watch.

It's wonderful you feel so powerful.
Many people don't.

Come on. Tip over.

Tip over.
It's all right, Matilda.

I really did do it, Miss Honey.
Sometimes you can do things.

But when you want to show someone,
then you can't.

Or maybe something is broken...
This isn't like that.

I don't know.
Maybe I made myself tired.

Would you like to go to my house?
I'd like that very much.

Good.

Good.

I just stare very hard
and I can feel the strongness.

I feel I can move almost anything.

You do believe me. Don't you?
You should believe in it.

Believe it with all your heart.

That's where Miss Trunchbull lives.

Why is there a swing?
A girl used to live in that house.

Her life was good and happy.
When she was two. Her mother died.

Her father was a doctor. He needed
someone to look after things.

He asked the mother's stepsister
to live with them.

But the girl's aunt was mean
and treated her badly.

Trunchbull?
Yes.

Then the girl's father died.
How did her father die?

The police said he killed himself.
Why would he do that?

No one knows.

The end is happier.
She found a small cottage.

She rented it for $50 a month and
planted hundreds of wild flowers.

And she moved out of the house.
Good for her.

Do you know why I told you this?
No.

Your family doesn't appreciate you.
One day, things will be different.

Should we have tea and cookies?
Yes, please.

It's the cottage from your story.
Yes.

The young woman is you!

Then... No!
Yes.

Aunt Trunchbull.

When I left Aunt Trunchbull's home.
I left all my treasures behind.

Treasures?
Photos of my mother and father.

And a beautiful doll my mother
gave me. Lissy Doll, I called her.

Milk?
Yes, please.

Why don't you run away?

I've thought about it,
but I can't abandon my children.

Without teaching I'd have nothing.
You're very brave.

Not as brave as you.
I thought adults weren't afraid.

All adults get scared,
just like children.

I wonder
what Miss Trunchbull is afraid of.

I wonder
what Miss Trunchbull is afraid of.

There she is!

Shot-put. Hammer throw.
Javelin.

Back. Back. Back.

She's afraid of a cat?
Black cats. She's superstitious.

Poor kitty.
He's all right.

Let's go get your treasures.
No!

She's gone. Come on!

Matilda!

Miss Honey!

Move, you piece ofjunkyard fodder!
Shift, you filthy...

My house!

Oh, my!

My father's portrait was there.
The artist must have been brave.

Really brave.

We should go...
Father's chocolate box.

After supper, he'd take a chocolate
and cut it in half.

And he'd give me the bigger half.

When he died.
I couldn't even sneak one.

She'd take a chocolate and say:

Much too good for children!

Have one.

No. She'd notice.

Where's Lissy Doll?
Upstairs.

Matilda...

This is my room.

That's my dad.
What's his name?

Magnus. I called him King Magnus.
And he called me Bumblebee.

I don't think he killed himself.
Neither do I.

Is that Lissy Doll?

Wormwood!

You useless. Used car salesman scum!
Come here. Now!

I know what "caveat emptor" means,
but I'm gonna sue you!

I'II burn down your shop! I'll shove
thatjalopy up your bazonga!

You're gonna look like roadkill!
You what...?

Come on.

Shouldn't we hide?
Go out the kitchen door.

I'll distract her.

Who's in my house?

Come out and fight like a man!

Tally-ho!

Come on.

Over there.

Some rats are gonna die today.

Oh, my goodness.

Feel my heart. Weren't you
the most scared you've ever been?

She shouldn't treat people that way.
Somebody has to teach her a lesson.

When she leaves, we'll get the doll.

What?
Just kidding.

Come here.

Promise me you'll never
go back in that house again.

I promise.
Okay. Come on.

He came home with $2.000 cash
and he threw it up in the air.

We swam in it like we were on
"The Million Dollar Sticky"!

Do you like that show?
I love that show.

Now he has money in banks all over.
But does he give me a dime?

Matilda. This is Bob and Bill.
They're cops.

They are Ace Power Boat salesmen.
Babyface, I'm starved!

Hi, Harry.
Who are you?

What is this? A hot tub party?

You're entertaining surfers?
They're cops, Dad.

Are you interested in time-share?
Get out.

Are you interested in time-share?
Get out.

You don't let me talk to people!

I need to talk to someone
besides the kids.

A man is entitled to come home
and find dinner on the table!

Dad. Yell at me, okay?
Shut up and leave us alone!

Yell at me again!
I'll pound your miserable hide!

I want respect! You'll get
a tanning you won't forget!

My word is law!

<i>No kid likes being yelled at.</i>
<i>But Harry's ranting and raving -</i>

<i>- gave Matilda the key to her power.</i>

<i>To unlock that power,</i>
<i>all she had to do was practice.</i>

<i>Start acting like a Wormwood!</i>
<i>What are you? Stupid?</i>

<i>There's something wrong with her.</i>

<i>If you're a Wormwood, it's time</i>
<i>you started acting like one!</i>

<i>That was one of my favorites,</i>
<i>played for all you pretty ones.</i>

<i>Playing music to make you smile...</i>

<i>Playing music to make you smile...</i>

Don't we need a search warrant?
No. This guy's dirty.

We'll show this tape in court.
That box is full of stolen parts.

How about letting me
handle that camera for a while?

Do you know how to use it?
Do you know about the zoom?

How to adjust the eye piece?
I can handle it.

It's my turn.

Your turn to drop it.
I won't drop it.

You'll be in a lot of trouble.

The female minor.

Shouldn't you be in school?
I hope you have a search warrant.

If you don't, you could lose
your job or even go to prison.

Your father is going to prison.
Do you know where you'll end up?

In an orphanage.
We can make it a nice one.

The kind with food... and tiny
cockroaches. What do you say?

Your car is
about to run a stop sign.

<i>She bought some time for her dad.</i>

<i>But now. Matilda had</i>
<i>bigger fish to fry. Much bigger.</i>

Hey, dipface. Where are you going?
Out.

Have a carrot.

Chew your food!

Chew your food!

<i>Having power isn't as important</i>
<i>as what you do with it.</i>

<i>And what Matilda had in mind</i>
<i>was nothing short of heroic.</i>

Come on!

Lissy Doll, come on!

Please come here.

Leave me alone!

Magnus!

Miss Honey!
You'll never believe what I got you!

I also brought you this.
I ate mine last night.

I will be teaching your class today.

<i>Miss Honey was getting nervous,</i>
<i>but Matilda had a plan.</i>

She is really raving mad.
What did your father call you?

Hummingbird?
Bumblebee.

She knows the doll is missing.
And he called her Trunchbull?

He called her Agatha.
She called him Magnus, right?

Maybe I could put the doll back.
No. I can't do that.

Calm down.
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

You promised you wouldn't go back.
I was on the garage roof.

I did it with my powers.
All right. I need to think.

Powers?

I think I got them down.
Watch this.

And no more Miss Nice Girl.

Get inside, quickly! Run!

Get against that wall, quickly!

Water!

And hold the newt!

Join the ranks. Move!

I am here to teach you all a lesson.

Sometimes in life. Horrible
and unexplainable things happen.

These things
are a test of character.

And I have character.

Form a line across the room!

Fill this gap!

I expect you're wondering
what I'm talking about.

A child came to my house.

I don't know how, when or why.

May I...?
No, you may not.

But I know a child came.

Did you know it was illegal to enter
someone's home without permission?

Yes. Miss Trunchbull.

Stomach in! Shoulders back!

Do any of you recognise this?

Let's play a game.

Who was wearing
a pretty, red ribbon yesterday -

and isn't wearing one today?

Who does this disgusting ribbon
belong to?

I shall personally see to it
that the demented Lilliputian -

who owns this ribbon will never
see the light of day again!

I was at your house last night.

I broke your arm once before.
I can do it again.

I'm not seven years old anymore,
Aunt Trunchbull.

Shut your holes!

You'll be put away in a place
where no one will find you.

Look!

The chalk!

"Agatha..."

"This is Magnus."

"Give my little Bumblebee...

...her house and her money."

"Then get out of town.
If you don't, I will get you."

"I will get you like you got me."

"That is a promise."

Please don't throw him.

Lavender!

It's the Trunch!

Look at this!

Let go.

I didn't know I could do that.
Pretty good.

<i>Trunchbull was gone,</i>
<i>never to be seen or heard from. - </i>

<i>- never to darken a doorway again.</i>

<i>- Never to darken a doorway again.</i>

<i>Miss Honey moved back to her house,</i>
<i>and Matilda was a frequent visitor.</i>

Did you know the heart of a mouse
beats 650 times a minute?

Where did you learn that?
In a book.

It beats so fast.
It sounds like it's humming.

Hey, you!

We're leaving. Let's go.

Let's wrap these up.
I'd be happy to walk her home.

We're moving to Guam.
Guam?

Daddy's out of business.
I don't want to!

We're taking a permanent vacation!
We have to hurry to the airport.

I love it here!
Please don't let them take me.

Get in the car. Melinda!
Matilda! I want to stay here!

Why would she want
a disobedient kid?

She's wonderful and I love her.

Adopt me, Miss Honey!
I don't have time for this.

I have the adoption papers.
What?

Where did you get those?
From a book in the library.

Are you hearing this, Harry?

You just have to sign.
I'll be an only child again!

I can't think with all these sirens!

What do you think, pumpkin?

You're the only daughter I ever had.
And I never understood you.

Who's got a pen?

Here.
Thanks.

<i>This was perhaps the first decent</i>
<i>thing they ever did for Matilda.</i>

And here.

Come here. Turn around.

You won't want support payments?
No. We have everything we need.

Let's roll.

<i>So Harry and Zinnia got away.</i>
<i>And as bad as things were, -</i>

<i>- that's how good they became.</i>

<i>Miss Honey was made</i>
<i>principal of the school.</i>

<i>And Matilda found, to her surprise,</i>
<i>that life could be fun.</i>

<i>She decided to have</i>
<i>as much fun as possible.</i>

<i>After all, she was a very smart kid.</i>

<i>Matilda and Miss Honey each got</i>
<i>what they had always wanted:</i>

<i>A loving family.</i>

<i>And Matilda never had to use</i>
<i>her powers again.</i>

<i>Well. I mean almost never.</i>

"Call me Ishmael."

"Some years ago,
never mind how long, precisely..."
