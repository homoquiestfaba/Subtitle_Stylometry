RUSSIAN GANG WARS

UKRAINE, September, 1993.

Was it Babai?

Rasp's work.

<i>Time to bring the old man in.</i>

Birulya got killed during the arrest.

The moron went for his gun

and got three bullets.

He's now to blame.

You were just helping out.

He shot those guys with Kalashnikovs.

Then you finished them off with a Luger.
But they were already dead.

You get

what I'm offering you?

Life!

Think fast or it'll be too late.

<i>0therwise</i>

<i>it's death sentence.</i>

<i>Don't play dumb.</i>

<i>Testify against Rasp.</i>

<i>Then we'll bury him</i>

<i>like the dog he is.</i>

Hey.

Hey, Kid.

Hi.

Are your guys with you?

Yeah.

Lucky them, they got nothing to worry about.

They call her "Alien."

She's now in the Czech Republic.

You know her, don't you?

Yeah, she's Babai's sister.

Exactly.

She is

his only kin.

They grew up in an orphanage together.

Now she is in the Czech Republic.

I already told you that, didn't I?

Find her and bring her back.

You were stationed there
for three years, right?

Still remember the language? Anyway...

Here's ten grand.

Find Karasik in Prague.
He'll get you the guns.

Bring her back.

Babai will keep his mouth shut
and the cops will be screwed.

Here's a photo,

so you can show it around.

Crack empties your head.

It's like Torricelli's vacuum.

I trust you, Kid.

<i>The Ukraine used to be a part of Russia.</i>

<i>All former Russian territories
are subject to the laws of Russia.</i>

<i>We never invaded other territories
and do not plan to do so.</i>

I'm leaving.

I hope you never come back!

Want some sunflower seeds?

Yeah.

<i>Soon the Russian flag</i>

<i>will be raised again</i>

<i>in all the neighboring territories...</i>

What do you want me to write on the wreath?

You only write in Russian?

I write in many languages.

Can you write in Czech?

I can write in Russian and Ukrainian.

Fine, then write in Ukrainian

but use Czech letters.

Get it?

Put a tick above the letter C.

What do you want me to write?

You didn't get it?

"See you soon."

Shut up, smart ass.

Write the following:

"To beloved."

"Jacob Toporchek"

"from friends."

Put it in the trunk. Push the button.

What the fuck is this?

Hands off, you hear me?

Hey! What the fuck? Are you nuts?

What the hell?

That fucker flipped us off.

Bad luck.

So this fucker in the front seat goes nuts.

Says, "if I'm wrong, kill me, kill me!"

So the guy in the back with the bitch

whips out his gun. Bang!

Shoots him straight between the eyes.

The guy drops under the seat!
The bitch squeals,

"Let me go! I don't know nothing."

"I've seen nothing!"

Then the other one crawls
from under the seat,

all bloody and shit,

holds his head like this,

screams, "Fucking animals!"

Everyone stares at him,
the bitch is out cold!

Did he use a revolver?

Yeah! The gunpowder

got wet.

The moron ended up with
like a horn on his head.

Happened to me once.

The bullet was too soft, made of lead.

Flattened against his forehead.

Time to say goodbye to our buddy here.

Go!

Come on, guys,
you aren't really gonna kill me?

For what? For this?

On your knees!

What?

I said, on your knees!

Come on.

Stop here at the sign.

Booger, get the wreath from the trunk.

Got it.

Whiz, you're with me.

I don't get it.

Who's in charge here?

The beasts!

They control the crossing.

You want something?

Yeah, I want something.

What do you want?

To cross the border fast.

Three hundred bucks.

We'll sort it out ourselves.

I don't get it.

They're going to the funeral.

Can't say no.

Fuck, what's going on?

Wake up. You're missing Prague.

I thought someone flipped you off again.

<i>There's some synka...</i>

<i>- ls there</i> a <i>vynka?
Hey,</i>

<i>there' s akurka!</i>

That's molded cheese.

Get some. If you don't like it,
take off the mold.

Hello, boys.

Oh, I didn't recognize you.

You'll be rich.

We've never met before.

Trying to be cute?

I'm kidding.

I'm laughing.

Is everything clear?

They're all fags here!

Local girls prefer these kinds of men,

dancers with long hair and shit.

The language sounds gay, too.

The language is funny.

They call soap mydla.

<i>A plane is litadla.</i>

A car is vazidlo.

<i>How about povidlo?</i>

Russian scum!

You'd better get used to it, buddy.

Thanks'idlo!

Enough!

First,

lose your jackets,

go shopping and buy something normal.

Got to blend in.

Just dress up like
the dummies in the window.

What for?

So it's not so obvious who you are
and where you are from.

You got guns?

We're clean.

I'll get you some tomorrow.

We want service today.

Ask your girlfriend to service you today.

I said tomorrow.

Now go to the apartment,

get some sleep.

Leave the car in a parking lot.

That's all.

<i>Povidlo.</i>

I don't like it here without guns.

This is not our territory.

Some time ago, Mongol's boys came over,

just like us.

They were tired,

drank some vodka,

fell asleep.

And got killed.

No one woke up.

Who killed them?

The Chechens.

No one heard them breaking in?

They didn't break in.

The door was opened with a key.

They just walked in.

What's up, boys?

Fuck, why didn't you call, Karasik?

Oh, crap! I forgot to call.

Forgot?

I'm old!

I have sclerosis!

Then retire!

I spent 20 years in jail.

I live here now.

And you know where you're gonna live

if you don't shut up?

Where?

Nowhere!

Get it? Moron!

Is that all?

I got this knife.

What about another gun?

Didn't get it.

The Czechs let us down.

That's all I got.

So one of us doesn't get a gun?

Shut up!

And the wheels?

The car is parked outside.

It's a Volkswagen.

Here's the registration.

What's wrong with our car?

It will be waiting for you.

You'll pick it up afterwards.

Where do we find Alien?

She used to work

in the Tunnel.

What tunnel?

It's a pedestrian tunnel, shaped like a pipe.

You'll know when you see it.

Here's the address.

Who's in charge there?

The pimps are Russians.

They hang around scratching themselves,

probably high on heroin.

Shouldn't have brought
the blonde guy with you.

Why?

He's too cocky.

He's a whiz.

It's up to you.

Where are the hookers?

What?

Hookers!

What the fuck are you looking at?

Oh, yeah, baby, there she goes.

I'm done

looking for your veins!

Gotta use the groin next time.

No, I'm not doing that. I'll end up dead.

Then do it yourself next time.

Who the fuck needs you?

The whores will do it.

Check out who's there.

Are you alone?

Yes.

Down!

What the fuck?

Bitch!

Get out!

On your feet!

Move! Move, I said!

Go! Move!

Air gun. Piece of crap.

You fuckers don't even have real guns.

Whoever talks gets to live.

Which one of you wants to live more?

Why are you shouting?

Where is she?

How the fuck do I know?

Damn junkie, he's high!

All right, you got it, fucker.

You'll die first.

Take him to the bathroom.

Do you know her?

You want to make a bet?

Fifty hits and he'll talk.

I don't know. He's high.

Maybe even forty.

You're on.

Where is she?
Talk!

I don't know her address.

Shut up!

Shut your trap!

Where is she?
Bitch!

I don't know.

Think about it,

if he talks, you die.

We are not alone. You're gonna pay for this.

Done.

Well, buddy.

We told you, whoever talks gets to live.

You lose!

What the fuck are you doing?

Let's go!

Hey, man,

who's in charge here?

What for?

I'm looking for something.

Come on, take me to your boss.

I am the boss.

Quit fucking around.

I'm looking for Robo.

<i>You know Robe?</i>

I do.

Then come on in.

What do you want, Russian?

You got a Russian whore here.

I want to buy her.

We don't have anybody here.

How much?

How much do you want?

Fifteen grand.

Crowns?
Crowns? Dollars, of course!

I don't have that much.

No money, no whore.

I'll give you five.

You got it with you?
Yes.

Show me!

Show me the whore.

Show me the cash.

Zabar,

bring the whore,

show it to him,

then take his money.

They don't get away alive.

Wait,

I'll bring her.

You're a decent guy, Robo.

You are clearly very wise, like a serpent.

A serpent?

You mean a snake?

They say.

Wise as a serpent.

It's in Bible, you know, Adam and Eve.

What the fuck do you want?

Get your clothes on.

Someone's here to see you.

Why don't you leave me alone?

Maybe it's a visit from my relatives.

Is this your brother?

Yeah.

Doesn't look like it.

We're all brothers.

That's right,

we all came from Adam.

Some are from the Serpent.

Kid.

Hi.

Having fun?

I'm having a blast!

Cut the crap.

Where's the cash?

Let her come here first.
Then you get the money.

Don't bullshit me.

No cash, no bitch.

She's gotta go get her shit.

I don't have anything.

Shut up.

All right, chill.

Here's the cash.

Take out that shooter!

Move! Move! Move!

Move! Move! Move!

Kid, you're like Rambo.

Move!

Beef. go!

Move!

I'm coming.

Go! Go!

It hurts. Fuck, it hurts.

I'm thirsty.

Listen up, fuckers!

Booger, we got to drop you off

at a pharmacy or you're dead.

Don't say a word for three days.

No matter what. They won't torture you here.

Then tell them whatever you want.

Blame everything on us.
You'll get five years, tops.

Karasik will help you.

Got it?

I got it. Fucking hurts!

Hold on, bro!

Whiz, make sure he's clean!
Okay.

Get her out of here. Got matches?

Take a cab downtown,

then walk a block and take another cab.

Did you get it?
Got it.

What are you looking at?

What's all this? Fucking laundry day?

What if we have to leave?

Then I'll put on wet clothes.

I had to wash off the stink.

Haven't showered for a month.

How did you work like this?

Without washing yourself?

The clients didn't mind?

I didn't work.

What clients?

What's your name?

Whiz.

What's your real name?

Eugene.

Mine's Angela.

Nice to meet you.

Why "Alien"?

I really don't know.

It just stuck to me.

My brother and I grew up without parents,

like aliens.

Why are you "Whiz"?

When I was a kid

I got in a major fight with
the "beasts" in the market.

Stealing tangerines, oranges and shit.

Sol stole their hats too.

Came back

all bloody and shit,

but with three of their hats.

Rasp laughed his ass off,

and gave me that nickname.

You are funny, Whiz.

So Rasp sent you here?

What's the difference?

Well, you kind of

saved me.

Those Gypsy fuckers

would have skinned me alive.

Yeah, Rasp sent us.

To bring me back?

Well, yeah. To rescue you.

Why is the old man
so interested in me all of sudden?

First he shipped me here,

but now

he wants me back.

What do you mean?

Kid said you came here to work. As a whore.

Bullshit!

Kid knows better than that.

I am no whore.

Where is Kid?

'I don't know.
Nobody wanted to give me a lift.

Drove off as soon
as they figured I'm Russian.

Had to walk all the way.

Having fun here?

Fucked her yet?

No time for that.

Let's have a quickie

before Kid gets back.

Go ahead!

Got any food?

Go and look.

Whiz.

Got what we need?
Yep.

Whoa. A blank passport!

No more Booger. Whiz, give this to Alien,

and go check on our car.
You remember where it is?

Kid!

Come look! You're on TV!

So?

The car's there, but so are the cops.

You sure?

All the other cars are gone.

The guard is new, looks like a cop.

The dog is not chained.

Fucking bastard!

You think it's Karasik?

Maybe it's the license plate.

Okay, we'll dye her hair,

then we'll need to take her picture.

How are things back at home?

I was stuck here for two months,
seems like a year.

Fine. We fought.

With whom?

Why? Do you know everyone?

I know some.

How is Babai?

He's locked up.

Shit! Fuck!

Why didn't you tell me?

Shut up

or I'll cut your throat

in front of all these Czechs.

Sorry, hon.

Fuck.

Why is he locked up?

They pinned three murders on him.

Like I said, we fought.

Is he the only one?

Yes. Birulya was killed by the cops.

And how's Rasp?

Okay, I guess.

I've only seen him twice.

Got it.

Kid, there's something I want to ask you.

Yeah?

What does Rasp want from me?

No idea.

Ask him.

I am still alive

because I don't ask questions.

You're a good guy, Andrei.

You've been around this shit for years,

but you're still a bad liar.

No one compares to you

when it comes to lying.

Kid, let's get out.

Go to a normal country,

like France.

I'll work till we figure stuff out.

Yeah. I can join the Legion.

Get my citizenship in seven years.

I'm serious.

Let's go.

Yeah, right. Wake up, bitch!

Bastard!

Here's the deal, boys.

We can't stay here any longer.
We'll split up and meet in Bratislava.

Where?
Take a look.

There's a motel 20 kilometers out.

You won't miss it, it's the only one there.

Take the train to Bratislava.

What about the cops?

She's unrecognizable. And no one's seen you.

Everything clear so far?

Beef, you'll go with Alien. Whiz goes alone.

But keep an eye on each other.

Got it?
What about you?

I'll go alone.

It's easier that way.

I know these truckers.

They smuggle illegals into Europe,

the Vietnamese, Afghans, all that scum.

Truckers?

I thought illegals walked across the border.

There's a false bottom in the truck.

They fit 30 people at a time,
the trucks return empty.

Any questions?

What about the money?

We'll split it.

That's all you think about.

Grab as much as you can.

What the fuck?

What are you saying, bitch?

I saw you take the gold.

What gold?

The gold chain you took off the dead gypsy!

Fucking bitch!

Shut up, fuckers!

Kid, what the fuck?

Listen up, dogs!

If you're gonna do this on the road,

I might as well shoot you now
so I don't get caught.

Beef! Put the chain on the table!

I said, on the table!

Moron!
Shut up!

Sit down,

we aren't done yet.

You're going with her.

Remember what I said.

Alien, don't fuck this up!

I don't want to go to Rasp.

Nobody gives a shit what you want.

I said no fucking around, got it?

Got it.

Eugene, get the entire compartment.

We don't need company.

Compartment to Bratislava!

400 crowns.

Cut it out!

Good afternoon!
Hello.

Tickets, please!

What?
Show him the tickets.

Thank you.

PRAGUE to BRATISLAVA

I don't think so.

You need more?

We'll make sure you travel in comfort.

No need. Just make sure I get there.

Let's have a drink.

I get motion sickness.

All right.

Just don't tell Kid,
or he'll start shouting again.

By "shouting," you mean "laughing"?

By "shouting," I mean "yelling."

By "Yelling" you mean "cursing"?

You could raise the dead with that mouth.

I don't need dead people. I like them alive.

Angela, is something wrong?

Everything is fine.

If I did something wrong, tell me.

Don't be a moron!

You don't understand.

You're taking me to my death.

Bullshit.

Have you heard about the Kazakhs?

No.

<i>Rasp found out</i>

<i>that some Kazakhs</i>

<i>had gold</i>

<i>and some snake poison for sale.</i>

<i>He wanted his cut.</i>

<i>Brought me there.</i>

<i>I was to take them to their room,</i>

<i>spike their drinks...</i>

I'll be right back.

<i>And when they fall asleep,</i>

<i>take their shit and go.</i>

<i>I did everything.</i>

<i>Rasp told me.</i>

<i>But they never woke up.</i>

<i>They died!</i>

<i>Only they weren't just ordinary criminals.</i>

<i>They were cops from Kazakhstan.</i>

<i>That's when shit started to go down.</i>

Rasp gave me three grand,

sent me off to Czech Republic, to Karasik,

so I could stay there
till everything settled down.

He wanted to get rid of me,
but didn't dare kill me.

Babai was climbing up the ranks.

So I was sent away, and that bastard
Karasik started hitting on me.

When he saw he wasn't getting anywhere,

he sent me off to stay
with some "cool guys."

That's how I ended up with the junky pimps.

When I refused to turn tricks,

they sold me to the Gypsies.

That's fucked up! Let's talk to Kid.

Pointless.

Kid won't go against Rasp.

How do you know?

I know a lot.

That's why I'm in this shit.

I'm dead either way.
What do you mean?

Let's say I get there.
Babai keeps his mouth shut.

He gets the death sentence.
Then Rasp kills me.

Why would he?

Are you stupid?

The cops are after me because of the
Kazakhs. Rasp can't let me get caught.

Not till Babai is dead.

After that he'll kill me himself.

There's gotta be a way out.

Eugene, listen...

Let's run away.

Let's go to France.

France? Are you serious?

Yeah.

It's so nice there!

<i>Did you read The Three Musketeers?</i>

I saw the movie.

I'll turn tricks.
What?

You won't turn tricks!

Okay, it was just

a last-resort thing.

We'll see.

How do we get to France
from the Czech Republic?

We have to go home first,

get money, visas and real passports.

We gotta lose Kid and Beef here,

or they'll take you to Rasp.

Then it'll be too late.

Smart boy.

Smarter than Kid.

You'll see. I'm smarter than you think.

I will, soon.

There's stuff to do.

What are we gonna do?

We'll talk to them

at the motel, take our passports and cash.

Then figure out the rest

while we're waiting for the new passports.

Passport control. Kindly take your seats.

Those morons didn't speak Russian.

Started asking questions,
I didn't understand shit.

I pretended to be German.

For real?
Yeah.

<i>What did you</i> tell <i>them?
Das ist Fantastisch?</i>

Did you fuck her?

What's it to you?

Why do you ask?

Fuck, Whiz!

Can't do shit,

but the bitches are still crazy for you.

Oh, don't you worry.

You can't fuck me,

but at least you'll be able
to jerk off at the motel.

Hey.

Hi.
Hi.

Make yourself comfortable.

What's wrong with you?

Got to pee.

Yet you never said a word.

Holding it all in like a Polack!

I need to go too.

Stay cool.

We're gonna do it now.

Let's eat, get some rest

and then get going.

I'm so tired.

Kid, let's sleep a bit.

Wait till tonight.

We'll be in Hungary by evening.

It's not that simple, Andrei.

I got other plans.

What fucking plans?

What the fuck are you talking about?

We don't want to go with you.

We?

Who's we?

Shut up! Sit!

What the hell is this?

Hands up!

Hands up!

Put away the gun, you idiot.

Shut up, fucker!

Anyone moves, I shoot!

Whiz,

think about what you are doing!

Did this bitch get to you?

Are you totally nuts?

She's fucked up.

You're going to get yourself killed.

It's none of your business.

It's up to me to decide.

You don't know her, brother!

She is an animal.

She should be locked in a cage.
Away from people.

Shut up, Kid!

Did she tell you how she ended up here?

She did.

Rasp set her up.

Did she tell you
how those Kazakhs ended up dead?

All the shit started because of her,

she started the war, did she tell you that?

Shut up, Kid!

Okay. Show is over.

'Put it down,
and we'll forget the whole thing.

She got you drunk last night.
Time to sober up.

Shut up!

Kid, let's talk business.

We'll take the guns and the passports

and then we'll go.

Tell Rasp the cops got me.
He won't kill you.

Shut up, you slut!

Your gun.

Do it!

All right!

Slowly!

Watch out!

Here,

finish him.

Fuck!

Go wash your face.

We have to go.

Eugene, it's all right.

Hurry UP-

Stop drinking, go to bed.

I can’t!

As soon as I close my eyes,

I see them.

Who?

Kid, Beef,

Yakov Toporchek.

It'll pass.

They always haunt you at first,
as if they're still alive.

But then

they become transparent.

You can just wade through them

as if they were dirty water.

Rasp, it's for you.

Speak. Hi, Karasik!

I see.

I see. And where's the bitch now?

Fuck, who knows then?

Listen, Karasik,

you gonna read me the paper?

What good are you?

You son of a bitch!
Find out and call me back!

That's it!

Vasya, next time

don't connect me with anybody.

I am not a fucking helpline.

Hey, Rasp, I am not your fucking secretary.

What did you say?

All right, calm down.

Call China-man and Fedor.
Find out where they are.

Okay, I'll call them now.

Eugene, you know what?

What?

We can ransom Arthur.

Who?

My brother!

Do you know how much that'll cost?

What about France?

While we wait

for passports and visas,

we can steal Rasp's stash.

You'll get your visa stamped, all right.

On a headstone.

I'm serious.

Do you know what they would do to us
for Rasp's stash?

You think Rasp will forget

that you killed Kid and Beef?

Listen up,

Rasp has this guy.

They call him the Jew.

He keeps the stash.

How do you know?

I've spent time in the sauna
with him and the boys.

I figured it out.

<i>They'll turn up soon.</i>

It's pointless to look for her.

She's got no one.

But the kid

has a mom and dad.

Kids love their mothers.

They keep their money there.

Don't know exactly what happened,

but the bitch somehow talked him into

killing Kid and the other guy.

Kid was too trusting.

He got that from the army.

Insiders, outsiders.

Get a team of three or four together.

We need a strong pack
who will work well together.

Fully armed.

As soon as they turn up,

<i>they can kill the idiot,</i>

<i>but I need the bitch alive.</i>

We're going to need a car

not a stolen one.

Do you know anyone?
Someone who's never worked with Rasp?

I know a guy.

I don't remember his number.

I'll stop by my parents'.
I got it there somewhere.

What fucking parents?

Are you nuts?

You have no parents!

You'll be killed.

HEY. Angela!

What's with the attitude?

Who are you to talk to me like that?

I thought you were smart,

so think!

They'll be waiting for us there.

Who's waiting?

Whoever!

Cops, Rasp's boys, anyone.

If you need a number,
look it up the phone book.

Do you know his last name?

Yes. We used to box together.

That's great.

This place is full of boxers.

We can organize a tournament.

Did you talk to Bubble?

Talk about what?

You forgot? About the job.

Shit, I forgot. Family problems.

Fucking moron.

What's the matter with you?

Whiz! Tell your chick to shut up!

Why is she even here?

She's right. We asked you

to talk to Bubble!

All right, so I forgot!

I'll talk to him today.

There! See that yellow Opel?

What a piece of crap.

I don't get it. If that's what he drives,
how can he be rich?

That's it.

Let's get the fuck out of here.

He is at home.

He didn't get nowhere.

You really going to kill him?

It's not about me.

He stands in the way.

He's gone mad: He gets high,
makes decisions,

then men get killed.

Got a point there.

I'm not suggesting you kill him.

All you have to do is

tell me when and where he'll be.

What's in it for me?

How many bodyguards has he had?

What do you mean?

How many guards did he have before you?

Well, I know of two.

I know of three. And where are they now?

All kinds of places.

All kinds of places?

They're all dead. You want to join them?

I'll give you twenty grand.

You really have that kind of cash?

I will in a couple of days.

Yeah, right.

Trying to cheat me,

but we got nothing to talk about.

When you get the cash, we'll talk.

Till then, no offense,

but we got nothing to talk about.

No offense taken.

Do you know what happens
to those who do offend me, Kolya?

I don't know. Is this a stupid joke?

No joke.

They burn in hell!

How's Babai doing?

Still in jail.

Otherwise, no idea.

Been busy with other things.

Hey, buddy.

Couldn't find a better place?

Shit, bolts are too tight.

Moron, you got to jack it up

before taking the wheel off.

Are you dumb?

Shut the fuck up.

I don't want some old fart
telling me what to do.

What did you say?

Do you know who I am?

Do you have a fucking clue?

Take him inside.

Move the car.

Where's the stash?

I don't have it.

It's all invested!

Take my cash and go.

Anything?

I won't

say a word.

Take it all,

just leave me alone.

Don't you get it?

I spent

seven years in the slammer.

I'm protected.

It's ready!

Take him in.

You fucking animal.

Come on!

Open the door!

I don't want to die.

You won't find it without me!

Open the door, you little bitches!

I got the stash.

Let me out of here!

You, stay cool.

Let me out, you bitches!

I wanna live! I wanna live!

Let me out, you bitches!

Did you make a deal with the cops?

No.

You know how much they wanted?

How much?

A million.

Nobody has that much.

Even Rasp only had three hundred grand.

Some people do, Eugene.

Prosecutors, cops...

Fat pigs!

Who is Rasp, anyway.

No one.

What are we going to do now?

There is a way.

What way?

Why did Rasp need me?

To shut up Babai.
That's right.

Why did he want to shut him up?

What do you mean?

'Cause it's wrong to rat people out.

That's it.

Now, imagine that there is no Rasp.

What do you mean?

Could happen to anybody.

Then Babai can confess.

"I was following the orders
of Rasp, the deceased,"

"together with Birulya, the deceased.
I've seen the light."

"I repent."

He'd get ten years, tops.

We'd have to pay, of course,
to get him out faster.

Pay what?

Pay off the courts.

But less than a million.

How much, then?

Hundred grand, tops!

Then we'll split the rest

and go to Europe.
Live there like normal people.

I still see them in my dreams.

Kid and Beef.

If you hadn't been smart,

they'd be dreaming of us now.

Of you and me.

We'd be dancing in a corps-de-ballet.

Huh?

Dancing on stage,

except they would see through us.

Fuck!

They're becoming transparent.

Not as scary anymore.

What do you say?

Let's finish off the old man.

You already decided, anyway.

Here's twenty, like I promised.

Right on time.

Rasp's gone mad.

Did he switch from crack to heroin?

Very funny.

Yesterday, someone stole the stash
from the Jew.

Who did it?
I don't know,

but Rasp turned black when he heard.
He won't speak to anyone.

Watch out,
he may replace you before the war.

That's the only reason I'm dealing with you.

There's going to be a meeting tomorrow.

Captains only.

Rasp will go through the back.

And his car?

Parked downstairs.

I'll be walking him out.

All right.

When it starts, fall down.
They won't hit you.

No need.

I'll have my vest on.

Just don't shoot me in the head.

Deal.

We need you alive.

Good luck.

Good luck and good fortune.

The guard's not going to shoot?

He won't.

He's with us.

I'll take the TT pistol.

In case they're wearing vests.

Can it shoot through a vest?

Yes.

A Beretta can't do shit against a vest,
but a TT will cut right through.

Then shoot them both.

Dead don't talk.

You'll drive.

We'll go together.

Just us?

We don't need anyone else.

Whatever you say.

You're the Whiz.

She fooled

one of the Kid's boys,

nicknamed the Whiz.

Then they killed Kid and the other guy.

I don't know

who else this bitch is working with.

Maybe the Chechens.

Maybe the cops.

Either way, they stole our stash!

What do you mean, stole?

Fucking shit!

What about the Jew?

Barely alive. The money means shit now.

We'll find ways to help our boys in jail.

But we've got to punish these fuckers.

For Kid.

For our boys.

For that dumb-ass Jew.

But right now, we can't do anything.

That's what the cops are waiting for.
They think they can trick us.

They are wrong!

We'll make them respect us!

Seek and you shall find,

as the wise book says.

That's it.

Hurry UP!

I'm coming.

Bitch!

Whiz!

Are you hurt?

Motherfucker!

Come on!

Move!

Shit!

Come on!

Come on!

Come on!

Whiz!

Whiz!

Eugene!

UKRAINE, October, 1998.

Alien is doing fine.

She has two nightclubs, a restaurant,

<i>even a factory.</i>

<i>Why is she still alive?</i>

<i>She scared the shit</i>

out of those who wanted to avenge Rasp.

She had people decapitated.

People were strangled and burned alive.

She got in with generals, deputies,

and left the mob.

Can you get me a gun?

Luda!

Who are you?

Walk!

Face the wall.

Move.

Whiz! You there?

Yes, Babai!

Hey. Sniper!

Looks like our happy days are over.

When did you get
that last package from Angela?

It's been a while.

She was supposed to come

last week, but didn't.

Maybe your parents know something?

I'll ask.

Or maybe she just
doesn't love you anymore, huh?

What do you know about love?

Just kidding.

Babai!
Huh?

I meant to ask you...

Why do they call her.

Alien?

It's from a movie!

The one about the spaceship?

There was a monster, with acid for blood!

It laid eggs in people!

You seen it?

No.

How did it end?

I can't remember.

They tried to catch it.

I guess they killed it in the end.

Quiet there!

All right, talk to you later then.

Talk to you later.
