PUDDLE: <i>Steve was in</i>
the middle of a game

 <i>when his friend,</i>
 <i>Fa'ad arrived.</i>

(WHISPERS LOUDLY)
Fa'ad.

Fa'ad, pop the trunk
so I can hop in.

Why?

I'm playing "$500 if you
can find me" with Puddle.

It's like a more
incentivized
hide and seek.

I made it up
when I was a kid.

Well, that explains
the low prize amount.

The other twist is
that you don't tell
your opponent

that you're
actually playing...

Actually playing,
so they have to
figure that out too.

I'd like to play
that game with you.

Oh, you have.
Many times.

You're horrible at it.

Well, you're not
much better.

If Puddle sees me talking
to the back of my car,

she'll spot you
instantly.

We should be safe
here until nightfall.

Lot of luggage
back here.

Mmm, well, summer
"bacation's" over
and fall is finally here,

so that can only
mean one thing.

Fall vacation.

I'll be joining
my mothers and father
on a trip to the Gulf.

Always nice to see
somebody else's spill.

And of course you'll be
"trabeling" with your family.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I forgot that your family
has little regard for you.

No, they care about me.

They just choose
not to show it
with words or actions.

But with Emmy
and Puddle here,

I kind of have
a new family.

We all have our own
roles to play in
our little psychodrama.

And I'm hoping that
by taking them away
on vacation,

I'll finally be able to make
love to the wife character.

How clueless of you.

Don't you think
there must be a reason

why she insists
on "libing" in
that tree house?

Why doesn't Darren
let Samantha use magic?
I don't know.

She finds you
and your lifestyle
morally repugnant.

Do you think?

Of course.
This is a woman

who spent all her
time in the jungle.

She probably doesn't
even "shabe" her legs.

That actually came
up the other night.

PUDDLE: <i>It was right after</i>
Mom took her first
bubble bath in six years.

STEVE: (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Emmy.

Emmy, are you
taking a bath?

Emmy.

 <i>Of course, she didn't want</i>
 <i>Steve to know about it.</i>

Are you kidding me?
I wouldn't waste
hot water on a bath.

I couldn't figure out
how to use your dishwasher.

Who, Oleg?

Oh, just push the
dish into his chest.
He'll take it from there.

Listen, you've been
in the jungle
for a long time,

so if you want to just
soak in a hot tub

or shave your legs
or whatever...

That won't be necessary.

Are you saying that
because they're
already shaved, or...

No, I was saying
I don't believe that
one person is worth

the energy it takes
to heat 80 gallons
of water for a bath.

Oh, well, you may not
be worth it, but I am.

I'm filthy rich.

No, no, no, I wasn't
talking about money.

I was talking about
personal worth.

Yes, and I'm saying

that I have far more
personal worth
than you do,

but I'm not
judging you for it.

Steve, I am judging you.

Overruled.

Oh, admit it.
You find my wealth
to be emasculating.

I am not a man.

Then shave your legs, sir.

you have a better
chance of romance

with me in the back
of this escalade

than you do
of getting that woman
to go on a trip with you.

Just so much baggage.

We could move it.

No, I meant
between Emmy and me.

Let us out of here.

I was a fool to think
that I could ever
get close with her again.

Tell your mom I'm going
out of town next week.

On vacation.

Alone.

PUDDLE: <i>I was sorry</i>
to hear about that,

 <i>although happy</i>
 <i>about the $500 tip.</i>

EMMY: Did
you see Steve?

I found him
curled up in a ball

at the back
of Fa'ad's car.

Huh. That
can't be good.

Unless... Did he
give you $50?

Uh-huh.

PUDDLE: <i>Among</i>
450 other things.

Yeah, that's a game.

He's trying to make
it fun for you here.

He really is a big
sweetie, isn't he?

God, I feel terrible
about what I said
the other day to him.

I Just... I think
I was feeling guilty

about not staying
in the tree house.

Why are we staying
in the tree house?

We're making a point.
We're making some point.

But maybe we do
deserve a little
vacation

from the tree house,
right?

It is fall break at school.

Maybe we could stay
in Steve's house
while he goes on vacation.

Hmm?

Oh, yeah,
he wanted me
to tell you.

He's going alone.

Alone? What?

Oh, okay, I get it.
He's trying to
make a point

about how he's worth
more than we are,

and how he deserves
some big, fancy trip

while we live
in this tree
like animals.

Where is he?

Been there.

Don't want to go there.
Found you.

I'm not paying you
500 for that.
I'm not playing.

Neither am I.
I can't believe...
Five hundred?

Did I count that wrong?

I can't believe you're
going out of town alone.

Well,
you're obviously
not going with me.

Well, obviously,
because I misunderstood

what's going on
here between us.

Well, I obviously did too.

After all,
I'm not worth a vacation.

Well, I love planning
a great, big trip to go
on all by myself.

Oh, so you prefer
going with Puddle
and me?

There's nothing
I'd like more.

Well, same here.

Great. So then we're
not actually fighting.

No. We're agreeing.
Then go pack your bags.

You know what?
I will.

I'm really excited.

It's gonna be fun, right?
Yeah.

So you really
talked her into
going, huh?

Three weeks of her, me,
and a four-poster bed.

You know, you always
tell me to bring that,

and we never actually
put it together.

At least I have
a chance for
a little me time,

and I'm finally going
to finish renovating
my little cottage.

Wait, isn't that
on my land?

Yes, it's the old
hunting cabin.

You gave it to me
after I had
my second heart attack.

Well, sure.
I didn't think
you'd make it.

PUDDLE: <i>For some reason,</i>
Mr. Lunt was touched by that.

Well, I'm going up there
with a bottle of Chardonnay,

some stenciling,
and a good Kitty Kelley.

So where
are you taking
Emmy and Puddle

without feeling guilty
for not taking me?

You know, I thought
I'd just gas up the jet,

maybe take her
to a private resort
in Montenegro.

You know, Emmy's really
not a "gas up the jet"
type of gal.

You want to
impress her,

you don't leave
a carbon footprint.

Well, what am I
supposed to do?

Take her to some
shed in the woods
within walking distance?

Like the old
hunting cottage.

Yeah, that's woodsy
and rustic.
She'll love that.

Oh, no, no, no,
it's not like
that anymore.

I've been redoing
it for years.

It's all slate
and seagrass,

and leftover Carrara marble
from your pool house redo

you said I could have
after my prostate.

Well, easier to tear down
than to build up, right?

Is it?

Sure. Migo, why don't
you could go over there
with a couple of your guys,

put some leaks in the roof,

knock down some
of that gingerbread,

bring it back
to the skinning shack

it must have been
at the turn of
the century, huh?

That okay
with you, Lunt?

Well, it's just that
I spent so long fixing
it up.

I was sort of hoping
to retire there

when you stopped
needing me.

Hey, look at me.

I'm never gonna
stop needing you.

No, the last thing
that you'll see
on this earth

is my tear-stained face

as I shovel dirt onto yours.

I'm going to see this?

We're going to a cabin?

I know. It doesn't sound
like a huge step up
from the tree house,

but he's really
trying, isn't he?

They all are.

PUDDLE: <i>They were.</i>

 <i>Especially Migo</i>
 <i>and his family.</i>

We found that weird room
filled with china dolls.

I say we leave it.

It's a little creepy.

Steve said he wanted
creepy, right?

Yeah, you know, it's really
not the right kind of creepy.

Get it out.


Well then,
let me at least
tissue and box 'em.

So it looks like
we'll need
our bed rolls,

and it might
be tight quarters,

so I'm gonna do
a little touch-up.

PUDDLE:
 <i>She'd never admit it,</i>

 <i>but I think my mom</i>
 <i>was really looking forward</i>
 <i>to having a man in her life.</i>

MAN: Hey.

 <i>Until she was reminded</i>
 <i>that she already had one.</i>

Can a guy who just traveled
three weeks on a garbage barge
to see you

get a hug around here?

PUDDLE: <i>Kind of.</i>

 <i>My mom's fiance had arrived</i>
 <i>off a garbage barge from Peru.</i>

Oh, dear God,
you smell.

Yeah.

So why did you
take a barge
and not fly?

Well, you know, I was
in line to get a ticket,

but then I saw
this migrant worker

who was trying to get
back to his pregnant wife,

and, you know, he was
oppressed and huddled.

Not... Not so much a mass,
but, still, I... You know,

I gave him
my money, and...

Andy. Mmm.

Oh. Oh, no, no,
no, no. So bad.

Anyway, now I'm broke.

I got no money,

and the little money
I do have

is gonna have to
go to Hep C shots.

Let that be a lesson
to you, little lady.

See a nice bag
of soft cotton balls

but it's marked
"Medical Waste",

you don't use her
as a pillow.


(LOUD CLATTERING)

Oh, shy.

But then I got your letter.

And it occurred to me
the light of my life
has infiltrated the enemy.

Together, we can
bring Wilde Oil

to its knees
from within

and liberate
the oppressed masses.

Well, big plans,
but Steve really
is just the son,

and he is letting
us stay here

so Puddle can
go to school,

so there is that.

I can't believe
you're trading in
your principles

for some pampered
existence in some
luxurious McTree Mansion.

I mean, look at this.

This is everything
we fought against.

I mean, what kind of deal
did you make with this guy?

No deal.
We hardly even
see each other.

STEVE: Come on down, girls.
Our family vacation awaits.

Except on trips.

We do see each
other on trips.

Is that him?

Hey, pig.

Who the hell are you?
I'll give you a hint.

It rhymes
with candy cheeks.

What? It rhymes
with candy cheeks,

or is candy cheeks?

Dr. Andy Weeks.

Oh, come on.

I'm the guy
who's engaged
to Emmy,

the guy she's been
telling you about.

Yeah, well, I've never
heard of you before.

I've mentioned you.
He never listens.

She says you never listen.

Well, why don't you
come down here

and see if I
never glisten.

I'll be on the cover
of <i>Men's Journal</i>

a hell of a lot sooner
than you will, pal.

I'm coming down.

Great. While you're
coming down,
I'm heating up.

PUDDLE: <i>For some reason,</i>
it's really hard to hear
under that tree house.

Here I come.
Oh, yeah,
no, here I come.

Look where you're at.
Who's glistening now, jerk?

What, are you scared
to come up and face
me man-to-man?

Well, no,
you're in the way.

Well, just... Well,
you can come on the side.

I don't know
if my arms can...

Well, then,
now we're both...

Well, no,
let me come on...

Oh, my God.
I don't know why they
call you candy cheeks.

You smell like
a garbage barge.

Hey, you don't think
I'm self-conscious
about that?

You know, sorry, man.
I didn't expect me to be
sharing a McLadder today.

Oh, well, excuse me...

You guys, stop it.
I'm coming down.

Well, I'm glad
somebody's calm.

I'm calming down.
Would you move?

PUDDLE: <i>This</i>
continued for a while.

 <i>And to make</i>
 <i>matters worse,</i>
 <i>it was gardener day.</i>

You have to do that
now? Come on.

Emmy, you're not...

(ALL CHATTERING)

Lunt, you're
grabbing my leg!

PUDDLE:
 <i>And by the time</i>

 <i>we all got</i>
 <i>to the bottom rung</i>
 <i>of the ladder,</i>

 <i>our vacation</i>
 <i>had been canceled.</i>

I don't get it.

Why do we have to
cancel our trip?

Because it's inappropriate.
My fiance just got here.

Still can't believe that
that gargoyle
in Birkenstocks

is your fiance.

I mean, you're pretty
and beautiful
and attractive,

and he is like
a poor man's poor man.

Well, unlike you,
I don't judge people
just by how they look, okay?

I'm more concerned
about their compassion
and their principles.

Well, that is not
very compassionate

to those of us
who look fantastic

and don't have
principles, is it?
What?

No, look,
you can call Andy
a poor man all you like,

but you have no idea
what he is really worth.

Wait, is he wealthy?

Oh, my God. Is he, like,
Howard Hughes rich?

Is that why
he doesn't bathe?

No, he bathes.
He just got off a...

I'm not talking
about financial worth.

Then please stop
using the word "worth".

You know what?

I should go be with
my fiance right now.

MIGO: What's going on?

I have to deal
with this Andy
problem.

I'm gonna have
to destroy him.

No, no.

Anything bad you do to him
is just going to push them
closer together.

Well, what am I
supposed to do?

Act like I like
the jackass?
Yeah.

See, the kinder
and friendlier
you are to him,

the more he looks
like a jerk
when he pushes you away.

Kill him with
kind of being nice
to him.

I like the sneakiness
of your people, Migo.

I'll share that
with my peoples.

PUDDLE: <i>Later, my mom</i>
was with Andy, but she
was still mad at Steve.

Okay, this is
ridiculous, all right?

Just go use
Steve's bath.

There's, like,
16 different
types of bath salts.

No. Bathing in that
capitalist pig's home

would just
make me more...

How do you know
so much about
Steve's bath?

I'm assuming.

You know, if one were
easily emasculated,

one might think you,
uh, cared about him,
or something.

I am not a man.

No, I am. I'm a man.

Oh, I didn't mean to
emasculate you. I...

I'll be all right.

By the way, I do not
care about him, okay?

He's a rich son
of a rich dad.

If you're gonna
go after anyone,

I would concentrate
on the father.

I mean, he's really...

Emmy, that's it.
That's a brilliant idea.

Yes. We'll kidnap Steve,

use the ransom money
from his dad

to buy back the land
from the tribes
he displaced.

See, that's how
you help people.

Okay, but you can't
really kidnap Steve.

I mean, among a million
other reasons,

once he's released,
he'd tell everyone
it was you,

and you'd go to jail
for the rest of your life.

What if he didn't know
he was being kidnapped?

Then I guess it wouldn't
be the best kidnapping.

What if he thinks
he's going on a vacation
with his friend, Andy,

who, unbeknownst to him,
has sent a letter off
demanding his ransom?

See, rich people
have insurance
for stuff like this.

Oh, my God! Oh!

We get to stick it
to the insurance
people, too.

It's the perfect crime.

But it is still
a crime, you know?

And it's not gonna work,

because he's not gonna
go anywhere with you.

You've done nothing
but fight since
you met him,

and will you
please find a hose?
You're gonna hurt yourself.

Emmy, I did not win
a loose cannon at
the Eco Terrorist Awards

by not knowing
a little something
about water pressure.

Oh!
Oh! Andy!

PUDDLE: <i>So Andy went</i>
ahead with his fake
kidnapping plan after all.

 <i>First by making</i>
 <i>a ransom note.</i>

 <i>Then by trying to</i>
 <i>get Steve to like him,</i>

 <i>which he knew</i>
 <i>would take a while.</i>


I was hoping
to see you.

Steve, I was
hoping to see you.

PUDDLE: <i>But Steve was</i>
following Migo's advice
to act friendly to Andy.

 <i>There was a lot of fake</i>
 <i>acting-nice going on.</i>

I wanted to apologize
for accusing you
of not listening earlier.

I would like to apologize
for not being more
glisteny earlier.

Steve says, "We should
do something sometime.

"Let me get to know
the real candy cheeks."

This would be easier
if you gave me
the binoculars.

I happen to have
a backpack right here.

We could hike up
to my family's cabin
as early as...

Right now.

Let's.

PUDDLE: <i>And so both men headed</i>
directly into the woods.

Won't this be fun?
Great.

 <i>Stopping only so Andy could</i>
 <i>mail his ransom letter.</i>

Come on, new buddy.

I haven't made
a new buddy
since never.

 <i>And soon we had</i>
 <i>a surprise visitor.</i>

FA'AD: Have you a moment?

I just wanted to
know, not that I care,
who that gentleman was

that "Stebe" went
on "bacation" with.

Vacation?
Vacation?

Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm embarrassed
to admit

that I sometimes get
my Bs and my Vs
confused.


"Bacation."

Not that I wanted
to "trabel"
with "Stebe" myself.

Plus I could always
go into the woods
with him.

They went into
the woods?

They went
into the woods?

Look, she's right there.

I don't need you
to lipread for me.

It's weird they would
go somewhere
without leaving a note.

I saw him
making a note.

He was cutting
up magazines.

Oh, no.

I think my fiance's
kidnapping Steve.

Well, I don't want to
rush you through
the grieving process,

but would you like to
go on "bacation" with me?

PUDDLE: <i>My mother was</i>
shocked to find out that
Andy was kidnapping Steve.

Puddle, go find Migo
and Mr. Lunt.
Tell them what's going on.

We have to stop that
letter from going through,

otherwise Andy
will go to jail.
Hurry. Go.

PUDDLE: <i>I ran as fast</i>
as I could until they
couldn't see me anymore.

 <i>I'm not a giant Andy fan.</i>

They must be
going to the cabin.

Fa'ad, can you take me
to the cabin in the woods?

If you're okay
with me taking my "SUB".

No, we're not
taking a submarine.

What is with these
rich people and...

Oh, you mean SUV.

Yes, that's
what I said. S-U-B.

PUDDLE: <i>Meanwhile,</i>
Andy and Steve

 <i>were growing tired</i>
 <i>of being fake-nice</i>
 <i>to each other.</i>

Got anything to drink
in there, friend?

In where, friend?

That giant backpack
of yours, friend.

Oh. I don't think that
there's anything in it.

Just packed with the hiking
paper it came with, my friend.

That's not hiking paper.

That's the filler they
use to make it look fat,
you idiot... Friend.

You look fat, you moron.

my friend, are you?

Of course not.

And I can't believe
that you want to
be my friend.

I don't.
I'm kidnapping
you, you twit.

What are you
talking about?

I could overpower
you in a moment.

Yeah, that's why
I didn't tell you.

Come on.

Stop saying that.

Just lead us
to that damn cabin

so I can call Mr. Lunt
and he can get us
the hell out of here.

Fine. Wait,
what do you
mean "lead us"?

I don't know where
your stupid cabin is?

Well, neither do I.

What, you think I've been
everywhere on my property?

I don't think I've been
everywhere in my house.

Anyway, aren't you
some kind of
jungle doctor,

who knows how
to track things?

Ouch!
That hurt.

Look, you can't track
anything that doesn't

walk or leave droppings
for a trail, you know?

Like... Like that.
That's a trail, see?

Comes all the way
right up...

Oh. I'm sick.


Candy cheeks!

Oh, I think I'm gonna need
some of that hiking paper.

PUDDLE: <i>Meanwhile,</i>
Fa'ad and my mother
arrived at the cabin.

Steve? Andy?

Where...

What kind of cabin is this?

I know.
Isn't it wonderful?

Used to be
an old hunting lodge,

but now it's sort
of a "haben" for me

where I can just
slow down and get
to know somebody

recently "abailable".

Are you insane?

You were supposed to
take me to Steve's cabin.

Oh, "Stebe's" cabin.

Yes. We are heading off
a potential disaster here.

I'm so sorry.
I didn't get
that at all.

It's hard to hear
under the tree house.

No, I have no idea
where Steve's cabin is.

Are you good at tracking?

Well, I'm okay,
if they've left
some sort of trail.

You look terrible.

I don't feel so great.

I'm leaking like
the Exxon Valdez.

I think I'm
a little delirious.

These trees were
making fun of me.

Oh, but then I met
a family of raccoons.

were so delicious.

Quick.
Let's make love.

Oh, no.

God, you are just
a head coming out
a pile of packing wrap.

There's still
things we can do.

What is wrong with you?

I honestly don't know.

I think it might
be related to
the medical waste

I used as a pillow,

but don't worry about me.
I'm gonna be fine.

I'm talking
about the kidnapping.
You sent a letter?

Well, he led me
into the woods.

I thought it was
my last chance.

Okay, so where
is he now?

Well, he made this nice
hiking nest for me,

and then he went
to go get help,

which is weird,
'cause he's such a jerk.

It's because he's
not a jerk, Andy.
I'm the jerk.

Because when you asked me
why I'm staying with Steve,

I should have
told you the truth,
which is...

I like him.

He's my friend.

What?

Wait, you're not
just gonna leave me
here, are you?

You're a quarter mile
from the tree house.

Oh, come on!

EMMY: Stop saying that.

PUDDLE: <i>My mother</i>
finally found the cabin,

 <i>hoping that Steve was there,</i>
 <i>calling for help.</i>

God, it's grotesque.

Oh.

This is not
what it looks like.

Really?
Because it looks like
you're warming yourself

in a dilapidated cottage.

Yeah, the guys did
a really good job
with the dilapidating.

But I called Mr. Lunt.
He's gonna pick up Andy.

Oh...
Well, you don't look
very kidnapped.

Looks kidnapped to me.
Wonder how long
Andy's going to jail for.

Oh, Steve, about that,
I just want you to know

I would never condone
something like kidnapping.

In fact, I sent Migo
to try to intercept
that letter at your father's,

but he did not
get there in time.

It's okay. It's great.

I actually think
that it's great

that the money
might actually go
to a good cause, so...

My dad has insurance
for stuff like this.

Believe me, how much
did he end up paying?

Well,
I think your father
was a little worried

it would up the premiums.

At first.

Which is why he decided
to sit this one out
and not report you missing.

But... (LAUGHS)

I... I have
nothing else to say.
(CLEARS THROAT)

PUDDLE: <i>All of a sudden,</i>
I got why Steve made up a game

 <i>to make people</i>
 <i>want to look for him.</i>

That's great.

It's good to know
what you're worth.

You know, let's
change the subject.

Migo, you had...
Nothing else to say.

Hey, you mean
a lot to us, okay?

And, you know,
we're already here,

so why don't we take
that family vacation?

Really?
Yeah.

I would love that.

Hey, is there room
for one more
on this "bacation"?

Of course.

Well then,
let's bring "Stebe".

He's "habing" a rough day.

Hey, listen.
We can't have people
sleeping on the floor.

What about I bring
that four-poster out
for you and me?

Uh, how about
for me and Puddle?

There's nothing
I wouldn't do
for you and Puddle.

Migo, go do that
for her and Puddle.



Sorry about coming
on so strong there.
I...

You know, Steve,
you talk a big game,

but I think
what I really am
to you is a friend.


Please take
your hand off my leg.

I get it.
You haven't shaved.
