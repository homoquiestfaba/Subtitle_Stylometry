Hey!

(By BRISTON MARONEY)
[â™ª Freaking Out on the Interstate

â™ª rolling down the windows,

â™ª baby, I can't hear a thing you say

â™ª I'm walking back to my favorite place

â™ª and I can feel them staring at me

â™ª Baby, do you think I'm doing
something wrong?

â™ª And you got a lot in your mind

â™ª and your heart, it looks
just like mine

â™ª There's no use in wasting
your time anymore

â™ª I'm sorry I haven't been myself

â™ª and something got me down

â™ª What it is, I cannot tell

â™ª I won't be satisfied

â™ª with anything I've earned

â™ª Fear is just a part of love

â™ª and one thing I found

â™ª is love is what you deserve â™ª]

[ALICE - downstairs] Oh, Graham!

Happy birthday loser! Ah, ah!Â 

Alice you know I hate surprises.

Yeah, and IÂ  wouldn't get you anything

[I'M NOT IN LOVE by KELSEY LU]

[â™ª I'm not in love so don't forget it

â™ª It's just a silly phase
I'm going through

â™ª And just because I call you up

â™ª don'get me wrong,
don't think you got it made

â™ª I'm not in love, no, no

â™ª It's because

â™ª because big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

â™ª Big boys don't cry

â™ª I'm not in love
I'm not in love â™ª]

I, I got it, thank you.

Do you want anything to drink?
Yeah, sure

Water?
Yeah that'll be fine. [CONNOR] Yeah.

Oh my god it's a miracle. I didn't think that
you'dÂ be able to walk again.

How does it feel?
Ah, it's fine. Thank you again for the help.Â 

Yeah of course. Here.
Thanks

So where are you from?

Well...the..uhm...the Washburn Apartments,
like two blocks away...

 Wait!Â The Washburn apartments isn't that the place

with the..uh...the rats from last summer?

Yes, yesÂ it is unfortunately, unfortunately that's true

Sorry for laughing.
No, no, no it's fine. It's fucking gross.


...uhm...the place where
[PHONE VIBRATE INTERRUPTS]

Oh... one second, sorry
No that's...


Hey mom what's up?

Wait, wait, what, how?

Okay. Well, did you tell him?

Okay...uhm...yeah
I'll deal with this later...

...uhm...yeah...okay, bye.


It's fine...Uhm...



Alice, can you get that?

Oh, hey Graham
Oh hey Dahlia.


My mom she would actually
murder me if I lost it





last night in front of everybody.Â 




from this hangover, nothing.



So how'd you meet Grace?

Uhm...Alice, one of her friends was having
a pool party and uhm...she was there.

and we hung out, we started talking,
she's really cool, I like her...

...uhm...yeah, yeah, we've hung out a few times
since then, including last night.


like...


but she is super attractive though, so that's a plus.

How about you? You got anyone?

what you're thinking, but no.

I'm too good for this town.
Men are fucking useless, no offense.


For right now, they're just fun to play with.

One day I'll move out to Paris and
I'll live in a beautiful apartment Â 

with a balcony overlooking the Eiffel Tower

and I'll sit out there in the mornings
so I'll watch the sunrise,

I'll drink tea, eat incredible food that

I'll post every day to make my haters rage

and maybe I'll meet some nice French guy
named Pierre, Remy.




He'll come over every day and

we turn on the radio and listen to some oldies
and dance in the kitchen

like we're the only two
left in the world.

We'll never get sick of hearing each other's stories
about what happened that day

or what we're going to do the next day because

with each other looking into each
other's eyes

that's the only place we want to be.

[GRAHAM[ That's, you know, that's amazing.



Are you seriously still dying in bed?

Usually you'reÂ dying right next to me

and then we play rock, paper scissors, shoot
and you make me mimosas.

Well, Dahlia came by earlier,
she forgot her coat or something

and then we went out and got some food.




Beep.

How long do we have to stay there?

Seriously though, if you keep complaining about
this party i'm going to get your ass

I just don't know anybody there


JESS] He's the kid who brought the bug to class last year
[[GRAHAM] oh absolutely not


I'm leaving. I'm going to.


she just met


I don't blame her one bit



Remember the time that Cassie used tip off
the side of the boat last year

making a straight up fool of herself

Maybe we'll find you the one today Graham,
who knows?

find your soulmate.


What are you doing?

Are you actually sleeping right now.
We are at a party and you're asleep.

No, no
Get up Graham, get up!

Noooooo





Okay


I'm so sorry

I'm Grace
I'm Graham



totally sabotaging any chance at the championship?









Goodnight Alice.

So is Dahlia coming or what?

Where's the dragonfly bracelet i got you? I made you?



Hey, hey what'sÂ up?





he's like going through a hard time right now

and we just kind of talked about like
the dragonfly and how transformative it is

and that really resonates with me

and so we scheduled these appointments then,
you know



with Dahlia the other day

I was dead, I was...

you're gonna get along so well with her..





You're 21,Â this isn't the time to be busy.

What's up?

Okay, all right. Come on! Come on! Â 

Ever since I was in high school,
it's always been my favorite thing

to just come down to the ocean and
admire how big the world is around me.

For a moment i feel so infinite yet so small.

At the same time all my thoughts
and my anxieties

just seem to be absorbed by the ocean
and the sky

and I like go.





[BOTH SCREAMING]





I don't know we were talking and

sitting on the edge,

she kept getting closer and we kissed




You know when people tell you about
something you haven't experienced yet,Â 

a feeling you haven't experienced yet or something

you look forward to it so much, Â 

but when it finally happens
it's totally underwhelming and

the opposite of what you expected it
to feel like.

That was when we kissed

I expected all the universe's questions
to be answered then

and to understand everything.

Maybe she isn't the one.

Or maybe she can't be.

When i was 13,
my mom told me it was just puberty.

She said don't worry Graham, go to bed,

they'reÂ just bad thoughts, they'll be gone in the morning...

but they never were.

It's been eight years and
they still haven't.

I used to look in the mirror

and the boy staring at me would be terrified.

I saw a boy,

and on the outside he was just
like any other boy,

but... but he knew really,
when really looked into his eyes,

really saw who he was, Â 

he couldn't figure out how,

he couldn't figure out why he was different.

He couldn't accept himself,Â 

he yearned for the validation of others,
struggled to find the right girl

and when he finally met one,
he thought she would have all the answers,

she would be the one...

she would be the one that
would help everything make sense,

she would...she would be the one
to make the struggle worth it.

But she wasn't.

She couldn't be,
she could never be the one.



you can finally be who you are?

what if i don't want this?

I just don't know what.
I...IÂ just don't know what I want.

I'm waiting for someone to give me
the answers, anything and...

nobody's giving me the right answers.

who you are except for you.

You have to find out for yourself.

You know who you are but,
when it's your time,

you can tell the world
or you don't.

Who cares how long it takes you to figure it out.


to accept the love you deserve.

My thing is: life is short.

Allow yourself to feel,  allow yourself
to get hurt and be confused.

You're human,
but never be discouraged by the hurt.

It takes some people a lifetime to figure out
who they are, where they're going and

who they want to take with them.

Life is weird,
you just gotta let yourself love.

I hate this country, its culture.

People sticker label after label
to their bodies,Â to their brains,

until they completely suffocate
the real-life person underneath.

Labels mean nothing,
they're just a way to generalize.

We're so obsessed with fitting in that

we forget that people
are never one-dimensional.

You shouldn't have to define yourself,

you should just be allowed to be.

In our crazy messed up world,

if you're different,
you just have to tell everyone.

[GRAHAM[ I just don't know if I'm ready.


let alone even know yourself,

but for people like Grace

make sure not anyone get hurt.

Every day I wake up  Â 

and look at myself in the mirror
and think

if I died today would I be happy
with how I lived? Did I live authentically?

Your heart's going to die one day Graham,
but your soul will live on.

And you nor anyone else

won't ever be able to touch or love
your body ever again.

Be free and enjoy it while you can,
it's your only one.

[ALICE - VOICEMAIL] Hey Graham I'm not home right now because

I'm currently with Cassie grabbing some last minute
things for tonight.

I completely forgot that we moved
Jess's birthday celebration

to this weekendÂ  and not next weekend.

So hopefully your suit is ready.

Her and her cousin are coming
over at like six

so if you could please, please, please,
please clean the kitchen

so i don't start stress vomiting,
that'd be great.

All right, thank you, so much.
Cassie and I'll be there ASAP, okay, bye.

[FLY ME TO THE MOON
by BOBBY WOMACK]

[â™ª Fly me

â™ª Fly me to the moon

â™ª And let me play among the stars

â™ª Let me see

â™ª Oh I wanna see what spring is like

â™ª On Jupiter

â™ª On Jupiter and Mars

â™ª In other words, hold my hand â™ª]




why did we move it to this weekend?

you can't go to the bars yet.



Who's this?
[JESS} Oh this is my cousin Connor.






with this chicken.

like two, three hours?



the chicken from Hannaford's,Â that's true

but like..I...I...







where Graham

he busted his ass in flame.
It's so funny



yes it was really nice he helped me,
you know...I...I...


we should go to that bar on the main street?



Yeah! Do you remember...yes

when you get..ah, ah...
this girl got so drunk,

her boyfriend had to drag her ass off the bar

because she was dancing so much...





this one's ex-boyfriend, let me tell you

uhm... ran me over with the bus one time so...

Wow...


[ALL TOGETHER] Red flag.




for the right one,  you know




Like they're so hot like.






The stars are a beautiful thing, aren't they?


and make shapes and images it's...uhm...
it's beautiful.


lost in their lives that

they forget we can just take a step back and
look at the stars

and realize how small we really are,

how insignificant everything is.

It's so easy not to

follow your heart,

lose sight of who we are,

to forget what it's like to be

blissfully and brutally human

but

we don't even allow ourselves to be happy.


to be happy and to feel alive but

not everyone agrees with it

but life's too short right?

and we're...forget it...

any of the dishes or anything?



uhm... it's like the first room





That's when she gave it to me
after my grandma passed away



That was my grandma's favorite creature and
we just kind of adopted it.

As I've grown up I've seen
dragonflies everywhere:

on my way to school, concerts, baseball games,

it's just nice, she's always looking down on me



You knowÂ  the dragonfly also means transformation.

You're like a dragonfly, you attract positive change

On the inside of you, dancing with you

you are capable of loving and capable of living, but

it's the moment you allow yourself to dance on the outside,

it's the moment you grow wings

scarier than living a lie?

Are you afraid of me?





I started getting these really intrusive thoughts,

you know like... it was normal.

I grew up listening to what other people
were saying and

I knew it was a part of life

but what i didn't realize

was that the other boys had different thoughts.

I just thought everyone was like me.

But when i truly knew
It was the day i fell in love.

His name is Peter.

We had been best friends since second grade,
we did everything together:

we played video games,

we talked for hours about
everything and nothing at the same time;

you couldn't, you couldn't separate us.

Around junior year is
when I started to recognize my feelings

and I knew that I wanted us to be moreÂ than friends,
more than best friends

and I put myself into this cycle of self-loathing

and it took me, it took me years to get out of it.

I'll always remember how hard I...I fell for him
and how...how much i truly loved him

and him and his girlfriend are so adorable
but I'm jealous,

and I'm not jealous of them you know, it's...

it's that mutual love that they
have for each other, it's just...

I'll always remember how he made me feel.

He...he was in my life for a reason

He helped me discover a part of myselfÂ 

and...and I'll forever be thankful for that.


You deserve all the love that
you gave the world right back to you.


I completely forgot, oh my god! Oh my god!Â 

Can we, I'm so sorry,
can you take me back to my house?


Can you help me get ready,
I have no idea what i'm wearing






okay...okay, whatever...

AsÂ if he even deserves to see me in jeans
as he even deserves to see me at all.

I shouldn't even go, I shouldn't even go

Why am I going? Â 


You've been looking forward to it

I'm doing too much.

like why do you wear a make up?Â 


Â 

I think it's fun...

umm...I think it's a really cool way to express yourself and

Honestly, the human faces are already so beautiful

and it's so cool that we can just like
add things to enhance our beauty.

Which one should I wear?


Why did you ask?


Can...can i try?

put on some...can I try some make up?




right now?

I would love to...it's gonna be so fun, oh my god!




You know that night I met you at...uhm..

.the train tracks,
when I patched up your knee.

and you overheard a phone call...

Well...uhm

That was my mom and

she had mentioned that she...umm...
my dad had found out some news about me

that he's not really happy with.

After I dropped off the girls

I came back home and
my dadÂ  was waiting up for me

and

next to his feet were bags of all my things.

He basically told me that I was a disappointment

and an embarrassment and that

I'm no longer his son so...
I can't go back.

Do you have anywhere to stay?


I've been staying with Jess on her floor but

I can't burden her about further, so...

I have some family on the west coast...

umm...that I'm probably gonna stay with. I...

I'm trying to figure it out but...

uhm...I've been meaning to go for a while, so...


he shouldn't have the right
to kick his own son out

It's...It's..just everything you've been through
just because you're...




Who am I?

I spent all the time expecting other people
to answer that question for me

and I...

I never thought that I'd be able
to solve my own problems,

answer my own questions

but

now I just listen to my heart

and let it guide me.

Life's a lot more fun that way.

It's...

It's funny how much you learn
about yourself when

you listen to your heart,
discover more things about yourself.


my heart tells me one thing and
my mind tells me other

and I never know which one to listen to.

How do you know which one is right?


My mind is like this massive knot ofÂ 

billions of like thoughts
and opinions and ideas

but people can and will control

your mind and play with it,

but you can always choose to listen to your heart.

You know?

when you're sad, when you're scaredÂ 

when you're nervous or when you're excited.Â 

That's why heartbreak is one of
the worst feelings to go through

and when I wasn't accepting who I was,
that's exactly how I felt.

I had this horrible feeling in my heart

every single day because I was Â 

something I thought this world
would rather get rid of than keep,

some freak accident,

at least that's how my dad felt, but

I used to always question is it worth it?

Is this gonna get better? And...

questioned if i even knew what i was doing

but

the night when we kissed
everything made sense.

You felt like a hand that wiped away
all the tears that I ever cried

it felt like

you took away all the bruises
and wounds from my life and

cherished them because
in that moment it gave me hope.

I knew it was gonna be worth it
when I knew.

[JE TE LAISSERAI DES MOTS by Patrick Watson]

Good morning.

Good morning.

[PHONE VIBRATES] Hello?

Yeah, what's up? Oh okay.

Ah... yeah, I'll be down in a sec.

Uhm...that was Jess she's coming,
comes to pick me up, so...but.

Uhm...I just wanted to say
thank you for everything

You already gave me my answer
the other night but...

but last night you gave me hope again so...

I'm probably not gonna see you for a bit but...

I hope that you're finding yourself, so...

Take care.

Hey Alice it's Dahlia.

Hey...uhm...can you just tell Graham to call me back?

Oh gotcha, okay.

Yeah sorry, thanks, bye.





Why have you been ignoring me?





You can't just throw me away after

we've been hanging out every single day
and there is nothing wrong.


to tell me that

657 
you flew home this weekend to see your family?
 

I feel like I'm going crazy


in my head about this fucking gay shit

You're asking so many questions.
I just need a moment to think.

to you and trying to give you advice.



I'm not gonna go!

We've been hanging out every single day
I've been trying to help you

trying to get a moment to myself,

I'm trying to get away from everything.


For 21 years I've been living a lie and..and

and I see myself changing into a different person
and I'm scared.

I've built up this barrier and
it makes me feel safe but

I can feel myself dying from the inside out.

Do you know how difficult it is
telling people who you really are?

It shouldn't matter but it does.

And I appreciate you so muchÂ 
for helping me find myself,

but i can't fall asleep every night because
IÂ  i know I'm not...I know i'm not normal.

Who the fuck wants to be normal?

There's eight billion people on this wasteful,
fucking  planet but only oneÂ  of you.

There's no other Graham with your smile
and your personalityÂ 

and...and your passion for life and the world.

Nobody gives the same love that you do.

You're so special and unique,Â 
you're so beautiful.


I've been thinking all my questions are getting
answered but they aren't

and, and, and I'm fucking tired of it.


you're learning how to love yourself unconditionally.

Your whole life people have told you who you are
and who you're supposed to love but

you're the only one who knows who you truly are.

I love you Graham and so does Alice and

Jess, and Cassie, and everybody

who's ever had the pleasure of meeting you.

I think I can speak for all of us

when I say that the Graham that we know isÂ 

an incredible, amazing, caring friend and

we're all so grateful for you and

wish you nothing but the best and

we wish for nothing less of you

feeling comfortable in your own skin and

being the truest, the best version of yourself.

There's only one life,

why waste such a precious gift
by holding yourself back from it?Â 


He was the person I was waiting for at the party.

I've liked, I've had feelings for other boys before,

you know the ones I used to just brush away

but he was different.

He welcomed me and everything I was

or, at that moment, everything I wanted to be.


The night he told me was actually
the last time I saw him

and that night we slept with each other.

I was terrified at first but

almost felt like the universe wrapped its arms
around me and told me it was gonna be okay.

For the first time I was able to like fully,

for the first time I was able to breathe.

I thought it was just a stupid one-night thing and

my life would go right back on track
to being normal

but...but now it all makes sense.

God all the time I've wasted.


I remember like it was just yesterday:
me and my little brother used to go out

to that lighthouse over there and

he used to think that
the little light on the top was a U.F.O.

and I used to pretend to be an alien

and chase him around until he got tired.


we first found out that he was sick.

We just thought it was a virus and

then a month later,
we were standing...standing in front of his grave.


It's just hard, you know, he'll never

be able to fall in love with a girl or a boy,
or even figure out which one.

He'll never experience his first heartbreak andÂ 

be able to have a family and raise kids of his own,

but it helps me not take anything for granted

because you never know when

one day will be your last, so...

you can't take anything for granted.

Every second leading up to this point in our lives

we were growing;

You were challenged not only by
the people in your life, but by yourself.

Every day, whether you notice it or not,Â 

you were loving yourself more and more

and eventually one day,

when you love yourself the way
that you deserve, you'll fly.

Come in...


very busy schedule...

No, what's going on?


to tell Dahlia that
I was going home this weekend?


going through some shit, you know

and...uhm...I don't like Grace
as much as i thought I did.


this afternoon...uhm...to talk to her.Â 



but...

Alice you you've been my best friend
since...for as long as i can remember.

You see me at my best and my worst and

I just, I never want to lose you.


I'm scared because of the person I am.



I'm gay.


I could never hate you,
especially not for something like this.

It's who you are.

All I want is for you to be happy,
you deserve to be you. I love you. .





You're a wonderful person but
I can't do this anymore, Â 

and it's something I've been battling with
on the inside my whole life

and especially over the past couple of months.

I like men the way I'm supposed to like women.

through all this. It's...it's been so much.


That was. I just...

You were kissing a different person...

A lost person who's trying to find themselves.




there's nothing we can do to change it,
you nor I can change it.

Falling in love is one of those things
that makes life worth it.

Taking that away from somebody just because

the society tells them they're invalid,Â 
it's a waste.

A waste of a beautiful heart capable of doing so much.

Unfortunately, so many people live
their lives never fully as themselves.

They aren't happy, they marry the wrong person,
they live an unfulfilled life.

Graham I've only knownÂ you for a few months,
but from the moment I met you

I knew i wanted you to live
an exceptionally happy life

and even though I can't help you in that way

I really hope you keep me along for the ride.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]


we should be doing?





and my week of my work gave me a week off so...

I just took advantage of it rolled with it.



I'm heading back soon so.

[GRAHAM[ Well, how do you like the west coast?


I found a job next to my apartment
so it's been pretty convenient, but...hum

...it's a lot warmer than here.

How are things with you?

I've been busy.

A lot of change I guess.


You seem a lot happier too.

I finally started finding myself.


I never thanked you for helping me.


you helped pull me out
of this messy place I am in my head

You taught me that it's okay to be who I am and

that i deserve to be happy,

and for that, thank you.

I was only a small part.

You had it in yourself the whole time.Â 

I just saw it but I was waiting
for you to find it for yourself.

I love you, Graham.

You're a beautiful soul in a world that's now yours

Love is such a powerful gift that we get to have.

As people we deprive ourselves from this gift
so much that we end up living unhappy lives,

miserable with ourselves until
we're completely burnt out.

Then it's too late.

And for some of us we're still
trying to find out what love is.

Maybe love is about taking care of yourself:

your mind, your body, but especially, your heart.

Maybe love shows up when you realize that
the people who surround you

are full of love to give back.

Maybe love is about letting go of what destroys you

and learning that regret is just a black holeÂ 
that nobody ever wants to encounter.

Maybe love is realizing that you don't deserve to.

We're all put on this earth with the ability
to take this love

and make it into anything we want.

At the end of the day, we're just people
with beautiful emotions,

all just trying to make our hearts fly.

[DARLING I DO by Zerox, Landon Pigg & Lucy Schwartz]

[â™ª Golden leaves looked brown to me,

â™ª The world had less color without you

â™ª Shapes in the sky, looked plain to my eye,

â™ª The world had less color without you

â™ª I know pleny' of people with eyes closed

â™ª They don't see you like I do
Darling I do

â™ª Notes on the keys, meant nothing to me

â™ª The world didn't sing without you

â™ª Birds in the trees fell silent for me

â™ª The world didn't sing without you

â™ª Without you

â™ª I know pleny' of people with eyes closed

â™ª They don't see you like I do

â™ª Darling I do, darling I do see you â™ª]
