From all of the places in the city,
He knows that Smith is here..

Did have a lucky guess?

No, He doesnt guess...

Thinks, things that we don't,
he was an investigator of the FBI

"Forensic behavior adviser"

How many times I have to say?

The details...

They are to important
in this business.

Hear, but...

Dont you think that he should ne bag soon?

the leader that stays
behind, He take it from the behind.

Also...

...it is very amusing to see violence.

No, baby, no...

We can call it Oliver.

Oliver?
yea, as Oliver Twist

For that is orphan?

For that I like the book.

Do you like it?
I Dint hate it.

That is a miracle

That birthday card,
you think that you can go with it?

Pretty and adorable...

Or... you are already a man

Sr. Hertz, how old is your son?

8 years...

Can you believe it? Not there is anything
in the TV about this

A bomb hurt...

Did you notice that?

That yea I noticed that?

look.

The politicians speak for gun control

...and it cries

We can change it to this hard Rock music...

...and he is quiet

That is strange

It should comfort him

Mr.?

The men are in the roof

That well

Anybody knows what
James cagney love scene, is?

It is when Cagney leaves
the good guy to live.

And when that happends in the show...

...I want alot more, in order not
to aks my money back

Let's kill this mother. Go!

I am not surprised that He likes Rock

You look like a substitute parents

No, I tell you, this means...

Go back!

My God, they are so bad
or this guy is very good?

Let us go boys!
They Still not safe

Kill the dog!
No.

why not?
I like dogs.

Give me a minute

That unfortunate rat

What it is?

the babies diaper

It is a terrible idea, Smith

It is the only one that we have

Your you believe that Oliver's mama
she lived near to a club..

...and that the baby could hear the
music from the club?

yea, for that reason he doesn't cry when
he listens rock music..

This is a ridiculous idea

He is not crying now

This is the only club
near where I saw his mom.

It is a very crazy hunch

yea, Can you explain all those
boxes of diapers?

Somebody needed those supplies

Lets find, who

Are you the owner?

Who asks?

I ask

Can I invite you for a drink?

No, I already imagined it...

This covered with hoops

Who occupies the room up stares?

go to hell!

Don't mess with me

You dont have the balls.

My God!

Who are those guys?

I Rent the room to a
businessman, 11 months ago

they pay for an entire year, cash

I never saw them again.
I believe that they entered from behind.

Open up.

This is very strange.

Sir.,There is nowhere to go this guy.

All the mothers have been killed.

Only one have escaped, temporarily.

We find the body, and
we confirm that she gave a birth

The child births suposed it was secret,

They start an manufacture
maternity, above a club...

...and it wasnt remain secret

We killed all the baby siters we find here.

When it happens, go to the left.

I Already made the call, they
must coming in any minute.

We will clean everything and we will try
to discover what happen

Thank you Mister,
I appreciate your trust.

Gentlemen, let find some answers.

Mind where you step.

The ice cream is melting.

What?

Your specialty is not
the donated sperm.

This this full with samples

That strange.

Seems to be only one donor

One donor?

yea, and is a very generous.

It is bone marrow blood, it should
to be for some cure.

How do you know that, Smith?

Youd didnt hear about my Nobel prize?

It is difficult to find compatible marrow
with that of the receiver

The possibilites improved if the
donors one has the same DNA with the receivers.

They were taking babys organs for
some guys transplante?

Exactly. And somebody didnt want
to avoid the transplante.

For that reason they want to kill Oliver.

No, baby, no.

So, I Called a guy that
I knew in NBC.

And I started to think,
Do you know what I hate?

Oh... there we go again

The movies that the good guy become 
to betrayed by some one that he trust.

yea, it is as serious as
to kill baby seals

Call to ABC, CBS...

The Post, the Times, the local
news chanel and the FBI.

And what you ll do next?

I ll wait to see the news, and if the story
goes in publin, maybe we will be safe.

look. He finally get to sleep.

You just wait. As soon are closings
their eyes so soon they began to scream.

Your you are not able to pleasure
anything, realy?

You hate everything.

I don't hate you.

For that reason you bring it to me?

you know that I didnt picked you.

you dont have any idea
what you have done to me.

We can get out of this.

It is that you don't understand.

what?

You bring me this boy so I can feed him
and take care of him.

And the baby could be die
in any moment.

And you are not even asked me what
happed to my own son.

You are right.

It is unforgivable.

I have the blame.

He didnt even called me mama...

If I ll ask you for forgiveness,
will you translate that to me?

The eggs must not
dance with the stones.

You Know, Smith...

I think I know what you hate most...

yourself.

What killed your baby?

Forget it

Tell me...

My "Pimp" stick me in the stomach...

My baby...

He was borned dead.

Get off of me...

You like this, hey...

It is a gun...

Fist, sliding bar,
it embroidered, canyon, trigger.

This is the side that
it make it work.

You should never point this in
anything that you don't want to kill.

This is important.
This is the insurance.

You have to have in safety mode
in order not to shot alone.

But in fact...

...this it is your best insurance.

Are you hungry?

Speaking of a complete discharge.

looks at this.

This is a Hammerson Nite Tac.

They will leave it for sale in 6 months.

That strange.

All have one of these.

Dont even tell me

Do you know how many
men of ours had liquidated?

Why to weast my beautiful mind
for things like that?

Doesnt make you a little angry?

When getting angry you loose one
enzyme, triptofan hidroxilasa...

...that they can reduce
temporarily the intelligence

Not I can give myself the luxury
of making that.

How do you know of that?

My boy is trapped with
the Discovery channel.

Take me to the West side.

I need to report him in,
I think I PE-d on who our Mr. Hero is.

We will no longer discuss.

I need to do this alone. And
to know that you are safe.

This is the only place
that you will be safe.

In a tank?

A tank M24. They are safe
from bullets and other explosive.

You are crazy

I am

I also speak seriously.

Is forbidden to get in.

Don't worry... I will create
a diversion and you'll climbe inside.

There is enough food
for the baby for two days.

The puree of carrots
it is the best.

Do you know how to use this... really?

yea, but what if you dont come back?

That won't happen

we can be sure.

Yes there is.

But mama I want to go home!

Stop to complain!

Behave well or I give you a spanking!

I want to leave!
Stop to complain!

I hate that hit a boy.

Leave alone!
No if you dont stop hit the boy.

I can disiplina my kind like want.
Do you like to spanking to you?

Do you go?, it doesn't feel very well, does it.

Its not funny!

Not it is funny!

What you know about this
so spectacular soldier?

Anybody so good
he had to start very young.

And usually their papa
it was also good.

The papa of MacArthur was general

And Mickey's dad Mantle
juice baseball.

My son dominates the games of
videos, and I was good for Pong.

Please follow me, Sr. Hammerson.

In 1967 the Englishmen put on
hard the control of weapons.

Many makers of
you arm they moved in U.S.

I have a man in immigration.

...seeing how many of them had sons...

...and yea some of those boy was a great hardshoot...

I believe that have been affecting from the "factor men".
You dont have anything for this man!

yea, Duchess was a good girl.

Sit!

yea. Now you ll play for your cookie.

My man that his been looking for him...

...he remembered the son
of one guns maker...

that was a National Champion of guns
in age of 10..

Candidate for the Olympiads,
and He recruit it by the army

But after that the kind never come back again.
Kisses...

It seems that operations
quarter trained him.

That which takes me to a theory...

Theory?
That sounds as a gossip!

The only thing that you know about him,
its.. is a man without a name.

...who arrived to town on a
white horse to give justice.

I LOVE THE CATS

Do You know for the people
of this country, why they love the guns?

Not because they like the word "discharge"

No, people love the guns...

For that USA is the land
of the opportunities

...where a poor person he can become rich...

...and a pussy can
be a hard type...

...if he's got a gun in his hand.

I Hope you are not just a pusy
with a gun in your hand.

No, Mister,
I am not

I am a tough guy, with
that pussy in my hand.

I want you to put this guy
and the kind to a deardbag.

yea Mister...

Right away, Sir...

Don't worry,
dad will return soon.

Hold it! Hold it!

Well-well-well, Mr. Bunny, you just
keep going-going-going, dontcha.

You also

I promise you not to kill you, if you say to me
where this girl and the baby are.

Forget it!

Oh

Who trained you?

NSA, Black-ops, CIA, the Army?

What who ever is the sme. It seems that
you lost your aim, champion.

You should see me write
my name in the snow.

Hey ya know my boss here thinks such
you're the lone rangers or sumtin...

But I believe I've a better
idea bout who you are.

I found out how your
wife and son were killed.

My God, what a tragedy!

Some guy walks into the BurgerJoy,
he starts shooting up the police...

Oh my God, what a shame,
that your wife and son were there...

...having chicken nuggets...

What's the matter,
you dont like that story?

I want you to tell me one.
Children story, please...

oh... I know, tell me my favor it,
tell the one about the baby

Maybe later.

When I will put you to sleep.

Go go go!

So What you are you thinking
about the right to carry weapons, now?

Fuck you!

Ok buddy, drop your weapon.

You think we kill him?

God Dammit, Smith!

So I found out who tried to kill the baby.
Who?

A certain Hammerso, was born with one
tablespoon of the silver in the bottom.

It inherited a corporation
of firearms

It wins millions manufacturing weapons

Do You have any idea of who
needs Oliver's "death"?

Its ok, Oliver.

Rutledge wins in New Hampshire
Shit!

It Is the Senator Rutledge.

THE CONTROL OF WEAPONS KEY

If he select the presided he will
make that Hammerson business

Ok, but how are you sure?

The Mr. right "Arm"
I call to their men nannies.

The Secret Service calls to those
protective of VIP, nannies

The Senator Rutledge is
the one that needs the baby

We will contact this man and there will
be no danger anymore. And its over

You are crazy?

Hammerson and the whole government
of the USA are after us

We have to leave the city

Until I have the answers you are not safe.

They watch over all the buss stations,
trains and airports

TRAVEL IN THE GREEN BUS
This is safe

I will investigate well.

I will reach you before
get on the bus

And if you don't arrive before we leave?
Where should I get off?

Honey, It's better
if I don't know.

What?
trust me

I cannot know it

Smith, you Believe that this
will work?

Attempt to the plan,
and everything will be alright.

Run!

You can forget the belt
of security

What in hell is that?

My God they twisted.

That sick sunova'bitch.

Oh that sick son of a bitch
stuck at us again!

It is time to go boy.

I call for the guy that he
protects the Senator Rutledge

Just Tell him, that the man with baby calling

Hello, Does Smith Speak?

Your man they try to clean the place of your
hide hatchery with babies in down town

But nothing will you succeed if I wont give the baby

Only in Washinton they have
so much influence

We are in the same side.

We can make it with the easy way
or with the hard way.

I want to see the Senator

Good. he also wants to see you too

I will go to North Carolina.
There are elections in three days

You can go in the airplane with him.
Track 7 in two hours

If I see something that I don't like
everybody will know about it

what you were doing here inside?

I was cleaning my gun.

Seriously?

We never realy trying to kill you.

We only wanted to make
you surrendered.

That explains the bad aim.

The Senator Rutledge, continues
to the head of the Democrats...

...before the elections
primary of Tuesday.

I owe you my life.

Here is the place that you were gave
all those orders...

I heard about you

It is worse than in television

It is incredible what
a little make-up can do

And a lot of morphine

So...

...You realy discovered us.

You are very clever Mr. Smith.
Very clever.

It was easy. You are a candidate
important for the Presidency

With Your proposal of weapons control,
you made mad the wrong people

yea they are angry now,But wait
I until be the president

There are so many lobbyists of weapons...

...that we will have
to establish many commissions

And maybe we do this way
our first law of the year

Those of the weapons
they informed about your illness.

They discovered the incubator
of your babies and they resolved the problem

They killing you by killing the babies

Correct

Where this my savior?

My God a he/she arms!

Do you know that the most I hate are the lies..
What In Hell are you doing?

You made a deal with Hammerson.
You are crazy!

When you went to bed, you filed with
their dogs hairs

And judging by the hair in your
pants, Duchess likes you alot

I dont know what are you talking about

I would say that he
wont be a president

If he ends up here...

Do you know what I hate most?
the hypocrites

And you are bigest of them all

That accusation doesnt have been sold?

Our operation is to find the baby

You see, Rutledge calls us
and offered us a proposetion...

...with the something that we had never dreamt

In exchange of his life, he promised us
to protect our rights

To go hunting deers with an "Uzi"

Please, Smith. The guns
they don't kill people.

But yea they help

Back off, back off.

Back of or I will kill him
Please!

I have to do it!
I must be a president

To put your self
before the people

I can still do good, in other areas.

Are you gonna squeal
with the public?

It is a Constitutional right

Back off! Get back!

Finally they convinced me

They convinced you just saying "Hello"

Allow me to give you an advice

Never trust people that try to benefit
against the peoples life, they are bad

Dont be silly. The game is over,
you throw the dice and you lost.

Let him go, Smith!
There is no escape.

Maybe for me not, but
for the woman and the baby, yes

For your assasination, Rutledge...

...will be a lot of anger and
the will support your proposal.

They will vote in the Congress...

...for law antiarms,
go by an overwhelming majority.

Their legacy... will live on.

Don't do it!

Don't do it. Allow to recover
some my honor with my...

son of bitch...

You son of bitch!

God Dammit!

Don't move Mr. hero...

Not I can speak sweethaerd now...
I am halfway something

Good-bye.

Don't worry, Duchess...

It won't gona happendto you.
At least for some years

Well well well well well.

Somebody gets to be smart
and somebody gets to be dumb.

Looks like you and I are finally
changing places, boy?

Yes, indeed.

The circle of life

the cirle a jerk of life

You are very good with the words

Now

I want you to tell me where
the woman and the boy are

Tell me, or I will be forced to
cause you considerable agony.

Believe me..

...nothing can be more
painful than hear you jerk talking.

I ll ask you... Again.
Where the woman and the boy are?

Thats is the last time that
you be doing that

Tell me what I want to hear. You decide when
pain will stop.

Why you doing this?
Its over

Sortly we will be finished for sure...

No, I should thank you...

They gave me a biger contract
because of you

I wasnt just Hammerson hominate

what are you babbling now?

You realy believe that
people that hires me...

...they will accept not to
kill the sun of Senator

you can hide all this...

The senator's airplane
crash at the river

And they havent been able to find
the body of Senator

Since I will silent you and
the woman, nobody will know anything

Again I ask you,
Where the woman and the boy are?

You know what will happend if you break me
another one of my fingers?

My son told me.
That You ll hit me in the nose

I ll Kick you in the ass.

I ll do something funny, I
ll brake one of that...

What if don't arrived before?

I know all of your story

The man that began to
shoot in the restaurant

He visited the store of weapons
that you inherited from your papa

Your you sold him the shotgun that
killed your wife and son

I won't tell you anything,
you God damned fucker

Where are you, Smith?

Well well well well

We will need something
a little more painful

Thats it

The guns are fabulous.
No, Hammerson?

Who is the great hardshoot now?

Oh yes, sir,.
It certainly was a pleasure

But before we part ways,
tell me one thing...

I am dying from the desire to know,
who you realy are?

As you say?

I said I am dead...
Stop!

Until there, you guessed right

is your wife

Hello, honey

she will leave me
