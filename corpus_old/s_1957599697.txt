Yeah, I see him.

Khaleel?

Khaleel's a man. He's aint all that bad.

For real?

(men chatting softly)

Leave him alone. He doesn't have a problem.

You're crazy.

He's preaching, and preaching, but

nobody in the neighborhood is listening to him.

He not making no fucking money.

Talking about we feeding them poison.

All this shit is poison, man.

That's for real.

He wants to be on the football team.

I'm not gonna let them get away with it.

These fucking white boys.

Excuse me, white boy. Ain't you on the wrong side

of the fucking park?

Belong on this part of town?

I'm a teacher at the school. I can't walk?

(man chuckling)
Teach, what?

Motherfucker.

I'll teach your ass something.
(dog barking)

Hey, we don't want any problems. Come on, let's just,

Is this your fucking park?

Get the fuck outta here, before I have these dogs

Motherfucker.

Don't let me ever catch you ass in here again!

I'll stomp the shit outta you.

(dog barking)

Fuck you!

(upbeat hip hop music)

â™ª A time to be born â™ª

â™ª A time for us to die â™ª

â™ª A time to smile, time to laugh, â™ª

â™ª Time to mourn, to cry â™ª

â™ª Time to watch me lose â™ª

â™ª Or even reach the sky, it's time â™ª

â™ª For you to choose to enter mind's eye â™ª

â™ª Brighten and be wise â™ª

â™ª And be alive â™ª

â™ª He can't decern, don't predict â™ª

â™ª Sign of the times â™ª

â™ª Believe everything at hand, except your eyes â™ª

â™ª Everything has a reason, season, purpose, and time â™ª

â™ª Keep your distance, so you see â™ª

(calming piano music)

(woman singing)

â™ª Come on â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª You know the way I feel with you â™ª

â™ª And I know that you can make my dreams come true â™ª

â™ª I'm holding you and your smile to show you inside â™ª

â™ª To being in love with you â™ª

â™ª I'm just so close â™ª

â™ª To knowing you want me, that you need me â™ª

â™ª You asked me once if I was satisfied â™ª

â™ª Cause this mind can feel, â™ª

â™ª Laugh and cry â™ª

â™ª Boy, you're the one â™ª

â™ª Who makes me sing â™ª

â™ª Yeah â™ª

(crowd cheering)

So tell me,

I got a call from a producer friend of mine in New York.

And pretty much, he said that if I show up in New York,

I have got myself a big, fat record deal.

Wow!

That's pretty great.

Now my only thing is, how am I gonna get there?

And I was just kind of thinking that, you know,

maybe the two of us together. You know?

You have to

take advantage of the opportunities in this life,

and I'm ready to move on.

Come with me. We can go together.

What am I gonna do?

This is like the sixth job my father's gotten me

in like six months.

He's gonna kill me.

You can't let other people run your whole life,

your whole life.

You need to decide what you wanna do with your life.

(upbeat hip hop music)

You know what I'm saying?

It's like, you have to decide what you wanna do.

â™ª Don't cry, don't cry â™ª

â™ª Wishes fill the starry sky â™ª

â™ª Brush a teardrop from your eye â™ª

â™ª Say goodbye â™ª

â™ª Goodbye â™ª

(upbeat rock music)

Lover boy.

Hi, honey.

Hi, mommy.

How was work today, pal?

Same as always dad, great.

If it's not hot enough, I'll put it in the microwave.

Okay.
Where you been anyway?

Probably with that girl.

Shut up!

Dad, he's going out with a black girl.

A black girl?

Yeah, a black girl. So?

What is it about? A black girl, white girl? Who cares?

Are you serious with this girl?

I'm very serious about it.

I'm so serious, I'm gonna go to New York with her.

What?
What?

New York?
(woman laughing)

Joy, talk to you son.

What are you gonna do in New York?

I wanna be an actor.

Actor?

Now you wanna be an actor?

That's what you really wanna be, is an actor?

Yeah.

(woman laughing)

What about I broke in getting this whole job for you?

Now you wanna be an actor?
(woman laughing)

Yeah, now I tell you. You know what?

I'm going to. I'm sick of this. All right?

I'm going!

Sorry, mom.

You leave, now don't come back

in this fucking house anymore, you hear me?

I don't want you here.

Butch.
(man yelling)

I've had it!

(birds chirping)

Anthony. Anthony!

What, ma?

I'm all set. I don't need money.

It's something I've been saving,

part of my bingo winnings.

Just take it, okay?

But, don't tell your father.

(soft instrumental music)

Oh my God! It's New York.

I'm finally here.

Come on.

(woman giggling)

Wow.

Hey, I wanna go on a subway ride.

A subway ride?

(soft electronic music)

All you had to do was look at the map.

It's right there on the wall.

I looked at the fucking map.

This is my first day here.

Like, you wanted to take a damn subway ride!

Yeah, I tried to.

It's always something that's spoils it.

You know what I'm saying?

I'm trying to have some fun.

Fuck.

How the hell we get lost anyways?

You know, why don't you ask somebody?

I looked at the damn map!

Is it a man thing?

No, it's not a man thing!

It's just not my damn fault, okay?

It's gonna take us forever to get home.

Look at this cracker with this sister, man.

(men chatting in the distance)
Hey, yo!

Hey, yo, cracker!

Hurry it up.

Smack the shit out your cornbread ass, nigga.

That motherfucker look like a scarecrow.

Look at that motherfucker.

corny ass, white boy.

Hey, yo!

What's up, white boy? You lost?

What you're doing in a black neighborhood, cracker?

This aint your fucking neighborhood.

Hey, yo. He lost like Dorothy, or something.

What you doing with a sister any, fucking, way?

(man grumbling)
Huh?

Oscar Meyer Weiner.

Like you can give her what the fuck she needs.

Funny, real funny.

Just shut up, okay?

Okay, just.
No,

You lost.
Cause you're gonna

I'm not gonna get us killed. What the fuck's he gonna do?

Yeah, I want some beef! All right?

(upbeat hip hop music)

(people yelling in the distance)

Fuck you, motherfucker.
(men yelling)

Come here, motherfucker.

Motherfucker.

(birds chirping)

(upbeat funky music)

Morning.

Oh god, finally!

I have an apartment in New York.

How's it feel?

Good, I guess.

Better than the Y.

Got a lot of boxes down there.

It's gonna take us forever to unpack.

It's gonna take you forever to unpack.

What do you mean, me?

Us.

You know I have to meet with producers.

You know I have to take care of business.

I gotta get my deal. You know all this.

Yeah.

(man sighing)
Yeah, I do.

â™ª When I heat up this shit â™ª

â™ª You would swear is was Auschwitz â™ª

â™ª Crying over this like Schindler's List â™ª

â™ª Cause the game's about hating and waiting â™ª

â™ª In the cut, salivating â™ª

Yo, man.

What's the plan, man?

You know what the plan is, man.

Disciple coming to town.

Yeah.

We gotta start recruiting motherfuckers, man.

Rather looking forward to that.

You know what I'm saying?

Gotta start organizing.

I take care of that. Don't worry about it.

Yeah.
Aint nothing.

What's gonna be what, man?

What about that cat Khaleel though?

What about Khaleel?

You know he's a knucklehead, man.

You know Disciple don't want no knuckle heads

in the camp, man.
Yeah.

It seem like he'd be a part of one of us though.

He one of us.
He can be

with the right upbringing, man.

But we just gotta see what Disciple want,

and see if he want him in.

'Aight.

And with the right training, he could be tight, man.

(loud drumming)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

(man singing)

Come on, New York City!

Show me some love!

(loud drumming)
(man singing)

You know, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Stop.
We aint here

(woman chuckling)
Her name is Debbie.

She's my girl.

And she be with Tony Mispelli.

Tony Mis-what?

Oh, you must talk bout them Italians, right?

(group giggling)

You so stupid!
I mean,

She can't check a brother out?

Look at me. You know what I'm saying?

I got it going on.

Sit the hell down.

Why y'all gotta keep being so damn stupid?

Cause they can.
Damn.

Know what I'm saying?

I understand what you're saying.

Believe me. Okay?

And I'm not saying that it's been a whole bed of roses,

or anything.

We have our problems just like everybody else.

Look, you need to shut up girl.

You ain't got to air your business in front of everybody.

I'm gonna be real with all y'all,

I'll be the first brother in line to pull me a white girl.

A fine one too.

And I don't have no problem taking her out from time to time

because I'm gonna be sexing her, from time to time.

Bring it home to my mom's?
(man exhaling)

Hell no, that shit ain't happening.

No way. No how.

I know my parents want me to marry a black man.

I mean, plain and simple.

My daddy would beat my ass

if I brought home a Brandon or Brett.

I mean, think about it.

Generations of generations of being slaughtered,

and all that.

You know what I'm saying?

You ask me, to me it's payback.

(man chuckling)

You know what I'm saying, dog?

Y'all are gonna help me prove my point.

This is exactly what I was talking about before.

Yeah, I know. Pass me the grease.

All I'm saying is, a man is a man. Okay?

And if I, as a black woman,

meet and like a white guy,

and he treats me with respect, I'm going out with him.

And so you should.

Yeah.

(calm R&R music)

(thunder roaring)

Babe.

Hmm?

(woman giggling)

Hey.

What?

Do you love me?

(man chuckling)
Yes. I love you.

Don't be silly.

I mean, do you really love me?

Yes. I really love you.

Now can I go back to sleep?

(woman giggling)
No.

Tell me why.

Oh god, it's one of your Little Women moments?

No. Come on.

Hmm,

let me see.

I think I love thee,

because of your nice,

beautiful face, and lips, your nose,

your eyes.

Now, I think I love you because of your ears.

(woman laughing)

And because you're ticklish!

(woman laughing)
No! No!

Stop it.
No!

Who's your daddy, huh baby?

Who's your daddy?

What are you talking about?

I said, who's your daddy?

(woman giggling)
Get away from me.

Who's your daddy?

(woman laughing)
Who's your daddy?

Okay!

You're my daddy.
Yes, I am.

Okay! Okay!

Yeah!
(woman laughing)

Check it out.

She's a finey, man.

Ah, I'm taking though.

That was some great work last night, man.

That was some funny stuff.

You do a lot of comedy in Bean Town?

You know, when I could.

I was able to get certain plays in, you know,

and I got some good reviews.

And actually Debbie,

the girl you met me with last night,

she kind of helped talk to me into coming out here,

you know?

I took a leap of faith.

That's fine, man.

I like her a lot, but,

I might even go as far as saying that I love her.

She's definitely gonna help me get

to where I need to go too.

Yo, check it out!

There she goes again, man.

50 bucks, but either way, she's fine.

You're sick.
(man laughing)

It's about doing something positive

and locking it down out here, you know what I mean?

We need some strong brothers like you running with us.

Word up.
I'm down.

You know what I'm saying?

And don't get me wrong, B,

we aint on no racist shit neither, yo.

Don't go out here, start wiling and getting it twisted.

You know what I'm saying?

We just on some strong black, strong brother, shit.

We need you down with us, you know what I mean?

Aight.
We about

running this shit out here.

We need to lock it down.

Yo, man. I'm gonna come tonight

Yo, do that. We'll do that.

All right?
Thanks, man.

Yeah. I've been trying to reach you for weeks.

Yeah, I'm here.

I'm here. I'm here in New York and, yeah,

I'm all excited.

I mean, I'm kinda looking forward to kinda

taking care of all the business,

and get this deal all put together.

I'm really.
(slow instrumental music)

What?

You're kidding me.

No, but see, no.

Do you remember?

I came all this way from Boston.

No, I came here, no.

No, I don't understand now,

but is there anything else we can do?

I mean, there's gotta be somebody else, or another way?

All right. Well, call me if anything changes.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay. Bye.

Fuck.

(woman sighing)
Shit.

(upbeat hip hop music)
Today,

is a good day.

Introducing the new members to the New Black Revolution,

Khaleel and his crew.

The white man's time is over.

He can't kill black leaders like he used to.

The devil that walks the street from today on,

will be hit by a rude awakening.

(horn honking)

Get ready for the revolution.

I'm no longer part of the problem,

I'm part of the solution for the black men.

They're telling you it's a good picture, but,

darling, I'm gonna be frank with you.

Tony, I really don't think our agency

has any place for you right now.

You need to take some voice lessons.

(woman laughing)

Oh my god.

All you've got is a telephone number on the back.

I also see that you're not a member of any of the unions.

What union?

Do you have any tape that I could take a look at?

Go away. Okay?

Listen, why don't you go home,

come back in a year.

Take a year, come back and see me again.

I mean, I have no idea how you got in my front door.

(upbeat funky music)

(phone dialing)

Hey, I got some Kool-Aid.

Hey!
Thank you!

So, what did he say?

Who you calling, mom?

Getting ready to try and call your sister.

Why bother?

She never calls us back.

Because I gotta keep reaching out for her.

Gotta give her unconditional love, like Jesus gives us.

You just gotta love her.

And just reach out.

(upbeat R&B music)

Girls! What ever happened to crooners

that used to make your heart cry?

Like Marvin Gaye!
Oh god!

What's going on?

Oh, mercy, mercy.
(woman giggling)

I can't believe you still have all this stuff on vinyl!

Rita, Stevie.

Those are the people who made me want to

get in this business in the first place.

I mean, they was really singing,

and they had to be funky!

Like, when I listen to my Shaka Khan.

Yeah, girl.

Rather, my Prince. Oh! Oh!

I mean, The Artist.

(woman chuckling)

He's the bomb though!

There really are some really good singers out there.

And you know what I'm talking about,

but there are some out there,

that are strictly on the hype, and the look.

You know what I mean?
Yeah.

You know what I'm talking about.

The thing that gets me though is that

I'm busting my butt, going to every late night jam,

and singer showcase in town.

Really perfecting my craft.

I have respect for the music.

While you got these other girl groups,

don't know a thing about music.

They're making all the money.

Look, been there, done that.

And the t-shirt wasn't all that cute either.

But no, no seriously.

I know you are gonna be just fine.

And don't you worry about all these no-talents

that's coming up,

because what you have, is what God gave you.

And nobody can take that away from you.

Yeah.
So you know what?

You're gonna be fine.

Not that it matters, but I need to make some real money.

Hey, girls.

I really thought he was gonna hook you up, you know?

Mind if I join you, Dylan?

Tony, Seth. Seth, Tony.

How you doing?

Yeah. How you doing?

Hey, so what's up with the firm, huh, bud?

Pretty good, man.

Had my best, first quarter yet.

Yeah, I'm on a fucking roll.

I just got another promotion.

Puts me at a six figure base, man.

I'm on my way. I'm a fucking King!

That's great, man.

Hey Tony, what do you do?

Oh, he's in the entertainment industry.

You know, TV, film.

He also manages some up and coming talent.

Yeah, pretty slick.

You must get laid like crazy, huh?

Yeah. I do pretty good, yeah.

Do you know what you'd like to order?

Would you like a menu, sir?

Menu.

Stupid bitch.

How was she a bitch?

Well, of course I wanted a menu. She's giving me attitude.

You're the one who gave her attitude.

She's doing her job.

So what's the deal, sport?

You like her, or something?

Hey.
I don't have to like her.

Hey, guys, come on.

We're all friends here.

It's fine. I just didn't know your buddy here

likes niggers.

You know, it's fucks like you

that make this world fucked up.

Tony.
You know,

if you're a nigger-digger, that's fine with me.

I just think it's kind of fucked up myself.

Get your fuck face outta here.

The fuck's his problem? Fuck you!

Hey, hold up Tony. Wait up!

Can't believe you're friends with that guy.

Fucking jerk.
It's just business, man.

We met years ago.

Can't stand Jew fucks like him

talking about how much money they have.

Like I give a fuck.

Right.

Talk about racist, Jew fuck?

You know what I mean.

I got nothing against Jewish people.

It's just that it seems like no matter how much I try,

some fuck head like him,

or it could be a girl, talking about some stupid

cause I'm white and she's black.

They got a fucking problem.

I can't stand that!

So sick of it!

I'll say, you know, maybe we should stop trying so hard.

There's plenty of the women out there, dude.

I meet them every day.

I mean, I know you really want to make this work out

with her, and I'm right there for you,

but you gotta take a look at this, man,

and how it's affecting you.

You love her that much

to go on fighting the world every day?

Yeah, I do love her that much!

(pager beeping)

Dude, I gotta go to work, man.

Let's talk more later, all right?

Hey, fight the power, brother.

Don't give in.
Okay.

(mellow hip hop music)

â™ª I don't understand why it gotta be like this â™ª

â™ª Tell me why it got to be like this â™ª

â™ª You see, I don't understand why it got to be like this â™ª

â™ª Be like this, it got to be like this â™ª

â™ª You see, I don't understand why it got to be like this â™ª

â™ª I don't understand why it got to be like this â™ª

What's up, Tony?

In the hospital?

What didn't you call me?

I'm sorry.

What happened?

(upbeat electronic music)
Tony, Tony,

entre vous, sil vous plait.

Why'd you come so far to see me?

What's the problem?

It's Debbie. She's stressing out, she's frustrated.

It's affecting out relationship!

You guys need some money? You got financial problems?

No, no, I don't need any money.

I'm here for her.

You know, she's been with you what now?

For five, six months,

and every time she sings, she brings down the house.

You know, Debbie's got all the talent in the world.

She's got the right stuff.

The other girls are getting deals,

and they don't even have half of what she has.

Look, these aint our schmucks.

They don't know the real thing when they got it.

They're a bunch of idiots.

Tony, I've been doing this gig for a lot of years,

if she's got the kind of stuff,

that's gonna bring her to the top.

Princess, tell him. Tell him.

Believe me. You can trust him.

Listen, I do whatever you want.

You got my word.

Rocco's word. And Rocco's word is good.

He will do whatever he needs to help Debbie out.

Listen, thanks Rocco.

I just wanted to like, come by and tell you what's going on,

and,
(man sighing)

Tony.
Thanks a lot.

Toodles, Tone.

Stop, Rocco!

(kiss smacking)
I can't help myself.

This one, he about this far away.

Talk about, I want you to make me look like Oprah.

I was like, how many years you got, mamma?

Why don't we just go with what you got?

What you got, which wasn't much.

But that's all right though. That's aight.

That's so cool to be a client, you know?

Nah!
I aint got no hair.

I need my hair done.
Oh!

About five seconds on your hair for free, hello?

What's up, Debbie? How you doing?

I'm doing fine. How are you?

You're looking good.

Oh, by the way, Bridget, Debbie.

Debbie, Bridget.

And, uh,
Donna.

Oh, you forgot our names now.

Ah.

I remembered your name.

See you looking good in that showcase the other night.

Thank you.

She was fly.

It was all that.
No doubt.

No doubt.

Aight, I'm gonna get up out of here though.

It's nice seeing you though.

Okay.
Have a good one.

Have a good set!

Aight.

See y'all later.

Uh huh.

Lil leap frog. What was that?

Bud.

Weis.

Er!
(women laughing)

Who was all this about?

Mr. Mack-a-liscious, dog!

(upbeat R&R music)

Is that one for you?

Sure.

Hey, how you doing?

Mike, what the hell you doing here?

Don't be so happy to see me.

Hey, by the way, how'd Carl feeling?

You know damn well how.

That's why I'm here.

I want you to send them him regards.

Make sure you do.
After all

he did for you, Mike!

How could you do this to him, man?

This is black call, jack.

All he did for me?

Look at all this talent I sent him.

Three Reasons?

Well, there were two.

I made 'em three.

Listen, listen.

Man, why don't you just get the hell out of my studio!

Easy, you're getting yourself all riled up now.

By the way, you look nice.

All right, listen,

just do me a favor.

Make sure you send him my regards,

and when this, Real Soul, when it falls

I give you three reasons you come work with me.

You're a snake, Mike!

(papers rustling)

Take it from the bridge.

(upbeat R&R music)

(upbeat club music)

Open up the door, bitch!

Who is it?
Man, open

the god damn door, give us your shit.

(upbeat club music)

Where'd you fucking go, man?

Who's the bitch now? Let's go!

Romeo! Romeo!
(men yelling)

Calm down, son. It's Khaleel!

It's Khaleel. Calm down, son.

It's me, man.

Harlem from back in the days.

Ta da!

(man laughing)
Man, you crazy?

I almost stuck your ass.

Yeah, yeah okay. I'll let you tell it, man.

(man sighing)
Romeo,

What's the deal, yo?

I got to find out from some hoe

that my partner's back home?

You know I's got to just come here and fuck with ya.

Hey.

(man sighing)

Man. After I finished up that two year bit,

I was like, fuck the bullshit, man.

There's too many young niggers out there shooting shit up

for no reason.

Yo, so I went around the state,

singing and shit.

Spent some time in Europe.

I'm trying to get a record deal.

Yeah, I hear that.

My man always had the singing skills to pay the bills.

Always had on some fine ass, sisters.

Ah! Just like a regular Marvin Gaye.

Yeah. I'm with that.

(man chuckling)

Yeah. So what's up with the gears, yo?

Like y'all ready for war and shit.

I'm glad you asked, my brother.

War's exactly what we all about.

We're taking over where the Black Panthers left off,

only we taking it a little further.

Ain't that right, black soldiers?

Yeah.
Yeah.

We are all members of the New Black Revolution.

This brother, named Trevor,

turned me on to the organization.

I've always hated white people.

Ever since I was in a third grade,

this big, white non-sun taking cracker

just stomped the shit outta me.

Whipped my ass bloody.

Just because I helped this little,

blonde haired, blue eyed girl get up.

Cause she was beat up by her brother and his friends,

telling me I'm just a dirty little nigger,

and I should know my place.

I got the medicine for that madness.

You down with the program, or what?

Man.

Man, it's too extreme for me.

(man chuckling)

That's cool. I ain't gonna fuck with you.

I know you ain't no joke.

I'll keep in touch.

Yeah.
All right?

All right, bro. Peace, man.

Let's go, soldiers!

I'm starving! Let's go sit down somewhere.

Can we go?

Eat where?

The Indian restaurant that we passed?

That one was cute.

I like that one.

With what?

Well, don't you have any money.

No, I paid the rent.

Besides, what do we have to go out to eat for?

I mean, why don't you try cooking for a change?

You know?

You know.
(woman scoffing)

Whatever.

What? You can't cook now?

One minute!

(woman sighing)

Hey, girl.
Hey!

What's happening?

Uh, just trying to hook this place up.

Whoa!

Yeah!

This is gonna be hard. Can I help?

Put me to work!
You sure can.

Take your little self over there.

I'm fixing the chair, get the materials,

and get a paintbrush.

Yeah, girl.

You see, I've been working, right?

Yeah.

I am so tired.

Man, this feels good right here.

Just even sitting on this hard ladder.

(women chuckling)

All I need right now is a massage,

a glass of wine, and a good man,

with dinner ready. And this place cleaned up!

Amen.
Girl,

what are you amening about?

You got a man,

and a cute one too.

And a cute one too!

Hello? Is anybody home?

What's wrong with you?

Is everything okay?

Yeah. No, I don't know.

We've been fighting a lot lately.

(upbeat hip hop music)

I don't know, but you're so caught up in this girl.

I love Debbie and everything,

and she's so talented, but it's like, hey,

take a step back, dude.

Take a look at yourself

and see how this is ruining your life.

This girl, this girl has got you lost.

She said you all tied up and confused.

I think you losing sight at why you came here

in the first place.

I'm tired of never having any money.

I'm always broke.

I don't have money for clothes.

For food. For me. You know?

Wasn't supposed to be like this.

You know what?

I know what you should do.

What?

Get a damn job!

Go make it happen.

You gotta find yourself again, man.

Get refocused.

Easy for you to say, you know,

you're the one with the money.

You have nine to five, okay?

I have no fucking money.

I don't believe he said that.

What makes you so special?

It's like my career, you know?

Do what I have to do.

How am I supposed to get a record deal?

By working that much harder at it, Debbie.

You know what, how Tony puts up with you,

I will never know.

He puts up with me

because that is the deal that we may coming here.

At least just starting out.

Right. And that was when you first got here?

When you thought you had a record deal?

Debbie.

I made a promise to her, and to me.

We're gonna make this happen.

There's a whole lot of people out there

that wanna see me fail.

So I go back to Boston, like a,

like a cry baby.

Oh the big actor didn't make it.

The big actor didn't make it.

Well you know what, I'm not gonna let that happen.

I had too much fucking pride.

Wait a second.

What ever happened to Tony the actor?

That's not my fault producers lied to me.

That's not the point, Debbie.

I mean, the point is Tony is working his off

trying to support both of you

working as an extra two days a week,

doing this whole bike messenger thing.

I mean, look, Lord knows you deserve to make it. You do.

But until then,

Debbie, if you love him.

I don't know.

I think I do, sometimes.

And other times I can't stand the sight of him.

Yeah but, all couple go through that.

That's the whole, couple thing.

That's just called a relationship.

That's all that is. I mean, you know, it's work.

That's all a part of it.

I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I need to do

to make this happen.

I don't know what it is gonna be yet,

but it's gonna happen.

See, that's the spirit!

That's the determination.

Yo know, it's not all about her.

It's about you too.

I'm gonna figure something out.

See, that's the old Tony.

That's the Tony that I know.

Come on, man.

Let's go get some margaritas or something.

How'd you get to be such Miss Know-It-All?

No, it's not about me being Miss Know-It-All.

Although, I do know a lot of stuff.

(woman laughing)
But,

it's about me being my sister's keeper.

Okay? You're my girl.

I got to look out for you.

You know what? I would expect you to do the same thing.

You know I will.
You better.

Listen, it's not personal.

I like this man, you understand?

Real Soul does not selling labels down.

Listen, listen,
No.

All you gotta do is,
No, no, no.

It's going down, man. Okay?

This is a personal decision.

Passion is paying. That's where I'm going.

It's been beautiful, brother.

Give my regards to Carl.

What's going on, baby? What's he talking about?

What this guy?
Isn't he your top

A&R guy?

What's going on?

I just got problems right now.

I didn't wanna say anything to you.

(man sighing)

We really got our hands full.

Got this deal going bad.

I don't know what I'm gonna do.

(slow bass music)

Fucking bills.

(man sighing)

Bills, bills, bills.

Paul Loupin, how the fuck do you

keep getting mail here?

Credit card.

(restaurant chatter)

Debbie, so what's the deal with you and that guy

I saw you with?

You mean Tony, my boyfriend?

My man?
Oh, your boyfriend.

You guys don't look too happy together, if you ask me.

Called a relationship.

Sometimes it's up, sometimes it's down.

Why don't you give me your number?

Maybe I'll call you sometime we can hang out.

(woman giggling)

Talk music.

Music?
Music.

Really. Strictly music.

Yeah, I'll think about it.

Think about it.

Girls are always thinking about it.

Why you gotta think about it?

(man sighing)

(phone dialing)
(upbeat bass music)

Yo, son. I'm about tired

So all his pro black shit you talking,

Your sister aint so much of a sister, bro!

Hold it down!
That son.

(upbeat hip hop music)

(phone dialing)

Money is always tight.

Bills and not getting paid.

But it's other stuff too like,

I am so sick of brothers calling me a sellout.

Like I'm supposed to be afraid of their stuff.

Now, you know, they think they got the bomb stuff, right?

You know, it's like grow the fuck up.

(woman laughing)

Or what's even worse is when sisters,

sisters, get all up in my face.

Tell me I should be ashamed of myself.

You should be used to that by now.

That's not cool.

I'm not trying to hear that anymore.

I know you aint.
No.

I know how black I am.

And I don't need a black man to make me a black woman.

That's what your mouth say?

Oh, you better go, soul sister!

Mm.

Although, some of these brothers

are looking fine as hell.

Uh, you care to name names?

No!

You know what, I know where this is coming from.

I know exactly what you're talking about.

Oh, Romeo. Oh, Romeo.
You're wrong.

Oh, Romeo. Oh, Romeo.

Oh, Romeo!
Stop it!

See, you're lucky I let you do my hair!

Oh, Romeo!
I'm gonna hit you!

(woman giggling)

(upbeat hip hop music)

Come on.

You know what's wrong.

Exactly what I needed your ass to do.

Now you gots to fucking go, hoe.

Hello? Romeo, what are you doing?

Calling me at home?

Yeah, you didn't have to do anything.

What if Tony had picked up?

You'd be dead in the street somewhere. That's right.

â™ª That god is all â™ª

â™ª Cause god is all â™ª

(crowd cheering)

(mellow guitar music)

(woman singing)

(man sighing)
Finally.

Here we are.

Cheers to you, Debbie.
(woman sighing)

(woman groaning)

What's the matter, Debbie?

I don't know what I'm doing here.

(woman singing softly)

(man sighing)

Look, Tony and I, we have our problems.

We're still together.

I'm sorry.

Then what are you doing here?

I've been asking myself the same question.

You know I wrote a song about us.

About you actually.

A love song.

I just couldn't finish it.

At first I thought it was

because I was trying to rush the song too quick.

But as I got to know you,

I realized that no matter what line I used on you,

no matter how smooth I tried to be still be,

you'd still be with him.

I don't know what to say.

I'm sorry.
(man sighing)

But you know what?

Maybe this time I'll let you slide.

But next time,
(woman giggling)

I'm not gonna be so lenient on you.

Thank you for understanding.

Thanks for being a friend.

I can't believe I can't find anybody.

In this big city, I can't find one person.

Maybe you somebody on the label,

that you've already signed?

I can't use anybody on the label.

Even Sabotage. I can't use anybody there.

And how about the girl

you said you heard a couple of weeks ago at that club?

What girl?

I dunno know. You said you sounded like an angel,

or something.

Wait a minute. Where was I? Um?

What girl was that?

I dunno. Downtown?

Rocco's! Rocco's.

Baby, you are,

you are the bomb. You know that?

Am I?
You are

a woman. I'm telling you!

(woman giggling)
Every time I'm down,

you think of something.

Cause I'm your baby.

You know where I'm gonna take you,

when I sign this girl?
Where?

I'm thinking right now.

Think, Jamaica.

You see any sand, girl?

Think the Bahamas.

What?

Think Bermuda.

It's getting hot!

Think Jamaica.
It's getting hot in here,

baby.
Antigua.

Oh, you working for that, aint you?

(woman laughing)

Donna's friend, Hassan.

He just got a big movie deal,

just because he did a showcase.

Those showcases, they're bullshit!

It's a scam!

You have to give them like, 300 bucks.

So you go see these big agents,

and he's big casting directors,

you give them your money.

They put in their pocket,

you give the performance of a lifetime.

Every single ounce of blood, sweat and tears

you have inside you.

And what do they do?

They clap like a bunch of fucking seals, like this.

And they go home with our money in their pocket.

A couple of hundred dollars richer.

Pathetic.

Don't get mad at me. I didn't make the rules.

It's not my fault.

Okay. Let me tell you for a second

what I'm going through.

I know all too well what you go through.

I've known it for six months,

since we've moved here!

Since you were supposed to be a big star!

You haven't been doing anything.

I've been doing.

I've been the one doing, doing, doing.

And you know what? I'm sick of it.

I'm sick of struggling.

I want my piece of the pie.

That's why I,

That's why, what?

What?

That's why I got these fucking credit cards

to pay for your fucking clothes and your stereo!

I'm sick of it!

Tony. What is this?

Nevermind what the fuck it is.

It's paying our way, all right?

It's paying our way!

It's for you.
(woman arguing)

It's for your TV.

It's for your friends!
You're gonna

get us put in jail!

You out of your mind?

No, I'm not out of my mind.

Yeah! Maybe I am of my fucking mind!

And you know what?

I'm getting out of here.

This is what you call taking care of business?

Well, what have you done?

This is how you're gonna get?

What have you done?

You tell me what you've done around.

I'm the one that's out there

trying to get us someplace!

You aint getting us shit!

I'm out there busting my ass!

Everybody's,
Stolen credit cards?

That's not busting your ass!

That's a free meal ticket, man.

You knew what we were getting into

when you came here!

I thought we came on here together.

I'm out here by myself,

and you're along for a free ride.

A free ride!

And I'm sick of it!

Jesus!

(door slamming)

Fine!

Fine!

(upbeat funky music)

(horns honking)

â™ª I got too much on my mind â™ª

â™ª Can't stand straight â™ª

â™ª Can't stay behind â™ª

â™ª Insanity taking over me â™ª

â™ª Gotta get down with some cash â™ª

â™ª What you talking about coming clean? â™ª

â™ª Gotta drop, three days a week â™ª

â™ª Testing me, molding me â™ª

â™ª Making me straighter â™ª

â™ª For your society â™ª

â™ª so easy being you to walk around â™ª

â™ª Without a damn clue â™ª

â™ª Nothing to sweat â™ª

â™ª All you gotta do is pretend â™ª

â™ª On the other hand â™ª

â™ª As a perverted idea â™ª

â™ª True life grabs â™ª

â™ª Making your ignorance show â™ª

â™ª Ego eating you from the inside out â™ª

â™ª Turn me out â™ª

â™ª Hey little motherfucker â™ª

Welcome.

I know you are here to hear the man of the hour.

But your United States government

would like to stop this brother.

But they cannot kill black leaders

like they used to.

Welcome the Black Revolutionary leader, Disciple.

Welcome my brothers and sisters.

Thank you all for coming.

The governor and the mayor of the city

are so worried and in fear of us,

they are so preoccupied about the $13 billion

that tourists spend in the city,

eating at our hotels,

sleeping in our beds,

and buying their Broadway shows,

they won't even speak to the real citizens.

It is time for you,

the real people,

the true people, to stand up and be counted.

(upbeat funky music)

(horns honking)

(woman sighing)
Debbie,

what did you think he was doing?

You had to know something.

How do you think he was paying the bills

by working as an extra two days a week?

Or working as a bike messenger.

I don't know! I didn't expect him to do this.

You know,

you think you know somebody,

he turns into a criminal.

I didn't expect it!

I should've known, maybe,

he was supposed to handle, I don't know.

You know, that was his stuff.

I don't know.
Okay.

Where is he now?

Here I am, New York!

You're not gonna beat me!

You're not gonna beat me!

(man yelling)
You're not gonna beat me!

(upbeat funky music)

Yo, what's up Captain?

Yo, Captain! Where your lady at?

Is this all you fucking do,

every single day of your life?

Heckling people?

All you sit and do is ask for money,

and you fucking complain!
Relax.

I'm not gonna relax!

And you piss and you moan!

I got no money!

(man yelling in frustration)

Just trying to help you out, brother.

White people.

Tony, where are you?
(dramatic string music)

(woman sighing)

(crowd cheering)
(announcer calling)

My team not gonna win, man.

The other team is gonna win.

It's not gonna win!

So what's up?

I got one step better than three reasons, baby.

What?

Debbie Lewis.
Debbie,

never heard of her.

Untouched secret. I'm telling you,

this girl is hot.

Are you sure?

My main concern is Carl.

I don't want Carl coming out of this deal

looking like an ass.

Carl gonna look like a champ, baby.

I'm talking Muhammad Ali.

This kid is gonna be shining.

Come on, have I ever let you down?

Not, but what's this freak name?

Debbie Lewis is gonna shine. I'm telling you.

Come on.

Let me do this, aight?
You sure?

(crowd chatting)
(announcer calling)

And who are you?

Rocco, my name is Oliver Cross.

I worked for Carl Davis over at Real Soul.

Carl Davis! Carl Davis.

Come in.

The son of a gun. I haven't heard that name forever.

Princess, would you get Mr Cross,

please, get him a refreshing drink.

Won't you, dear?

Attitude. Attitude.

Mr. Cross. How is the old war horse?

He's in the hospital.

What happened? His ticker?

Exactly.

He's been under a lot of stress lately.

Thanks.

What, with the new film division and everything.

But what did him in was recently signing

this new, girl group.

We shelled out millions for them.

Apparently, the girls,

they're bust.

What? They can't sing?

Put it this way,

you wouldn't mistake them for one of The Supremes.

And what schmuck had this brilliant move?

A guy named Mike Espo.

You're shitting me?

You know him too?

Rocco knows everyone who's anybody.

After all that Carl did for him?

That in the closet, SOB.

The question is, how can I help you?

Well, the reason for me coming by tonight is,

well, I think I might have,

rather, you might have the solution to this whole mess.

What does Rocco have that can help you?

Debbie Lewis.

Kid, you're the fucking balls.

Brilliant. That's great.

Here's what I have in mind.

(phone ringing)

(calming piano music)

Hello?

Debbie?

Mama?

I'm so glad to hear you, baby.

I've been trying to get you.

Is everybody okay? What's the?

Oh honey, I miss ya so much.

Are you okay?

Do you need anything?

I'm fine, mama.

I'm fine.

Is there something you want?

Yes, honey. I love you very much,

and I miss you even more.

Please read your Bible.

Mama. Don't start.

I know. I know.

There's lots that we have to talk about.

Mama, I'm sorry.

Debbie.
I gotta go.

Don't hang up right now.

There's some things I need to tell you,

but I wish you would come home.

I'm late.
Need to

talk to you face to face.

I don't have time to talk now.

I know you're in a rush, honey, but,

I'm sorry.

I can't talk now.

Hey, girl. I'm sorry. Tony's in jail.

Oh God. Come in, come in. Okay.

I'm going crazy.

I waited all day by the phone to hear something from him.

I've been trying to reach you all day.

I waited for you to get home.

I mean, I don't have any money for bail.

Okay.
He's all I got.

Just calm down. Just calm down.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

You know what?

Now I can't,

I can't promise anything,

but there's this lady, I do her hair.

Her name is Ms. Thompson,

and her husband is like this big time, major lawyer.

(woman gasping)
And listen.

No, no, no, no, no, listen.

I can't promise you anything.

But if I can find her number, maybe I can give her a call

and you know, maybe her husband can help out or something?

Oh god, Donna. Anything. Anything at this point.

Anything.

Thank you.
(woman sighing)

Okay. Let me go do that.

(woman sighing)

(phone ringing)
Hey, yo,

Hold on. Mr Cross?

Rocco's on the line.

Yo, Rocco. What's up?

Yeah, where is this girl, man?

Come on. We gotta find her.

Right, but you know this is what Carl would want.

Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I know.

You feeling any better?

No, I fell terrible.

I know you must be feeling pretty bad

to be calling me mama.

What?
I know

I don't look that bad in the middle of the night.

What are you talking about, Donna?

You called me mama.

I was like, now, I outta slap this.

(woman laughing)

I do not look like her mommy.

No, I'm sure I was dead asleep,

and I didn't mean anything by that. I am sorry.

Well, now, okay I'm ready to get into your business, okay?

But, you don't talk about your mom that much.

What's that about?

No.

That is a sore subject.

She was just really, really, really over-protective,

and very heavy handed.

Always preaching about, mmm, gotta go to church,

and do this. You gotta do what I say.

Don't be singing that worldly music.

You know, I was like,

finally, I grew up, and I realized,

I had to be me. So I left.

Well now, I can relate to you wanting to be you.

But, here's my humble opinion,

going to church doesn't sound like a bad piece of advice.

I mean, you need Jesus anyway.

There you go. You sound like my mama.

No, hey, I aint your mommy.

I know. I know.

Look, all seriousness,

I don't know how long it's been

since you've spoken to your mother,

but you might want to reach out to her.

I mean, you know, tomorrow's not promised to anybody,

and you just never know.

You never know, Deb.

Doing some ill shit, man.

That's not where were coming from.

Yo, man. It's like this man.

We got everything on lock down.

The black organizations, the black schools,

but I'm not letting the white man get away with nothing.

That still stands, man.
Fuck all that bullshit, man.

I told you from door, we aint on no racist shit, man.

We on some pro-black shit, man.

You on some triple-black shit.

Yeah, but that white man is still our enemy, man.

He has to die, man.

He has to die?
That's shit, man.

Some straight bullshit.

I'm gonna tell you like this,

you making our organization look bad, B.

And on top of that,

you making me look bad in front of my disciples.

I bought you in, and you fucking up, man.

I want the white man dead.

Fuck that. I'm out.

It's no use.

(upbeat funky music)

Hey, baby.

It's going. Hey, good seeing you baby.

How you doing?

All right. How you doing?

Good.

How's the label doing?

All right.

Christina, could you excuse us please?

All right. I'll see you later

All right. I'll talk to you,

Talk to you. Take it easy, all right?

Take care.
All right.

So baby, what happened? What's going on?

I can't find this girl anywhere.

I mean, I've been looking all over the city.

I mean, every major club.

Nobody can find her.

Man, I gotta do this for Carl. I have to do this.

Oh, baby. They called from the hospital,

and, Carl's not getting any better.

(man sighing)

That's all I need right now.

Listen, you gotta pull yourself together.

Listen, we'll get through this.

You hear me? We'll get through this.

You will find her.

We'll get through this.

I'm here for you.

I know.

You're the man.

(man chuckling)

That's why I got you.

And I got you.

Hey Debbie, I got your message.

I was on my way to the hair show. What's wrong?

I know you were.

What's the matter?

My mother, is so sick.

I think she might be dying.

Oh my god, Debbie.

She refuses to go to the hospital. I don't know.

Well, I mean you, you going,

you are going to see her? Right?

I don't know.
You have to go.

What's your problem?

(woman sighing)

The showcase.

Tony.

Look, Debbie. Okay. Look,

you know I'm dealing with Mr and Mrs. Thompson so,

I mean, I can take care of Tony.

And the showcase,

I mean, you know that's always going to be there,

but believe me, you are not gonna be able

to forgive yourself if you don't go see your mother.

We don't get along. I don't have any money.

Look, Debbie, Debbie. Listen to me.

You don't have to worry about money,

but you have to go see your mother.

You gotta get your priorities together.

Girl, that showcase is always gonna be there.

And I mean, whatever is gonna be yours,

is yours regardless. Nobody can take that from you.

You cool? I mean, cause we can do this.

Okay. Come here.

We need to make reservations. You gotta go now.

Okay.

So I got this group coming in from Virginia.

I got Sandy from Cleveland.

She's definitely gonna get signed.

I mean this girl, she is hot.

You know, she's gonna get signed.

I'm really excited about this.

Gonna have a good time. Gonna be wonderful tonight.

We're gonna pull this, man. I'm telling you.

Debbie Lewis, I'm so glad to finally meet you.

Debbie, where the hell have you been?

Uh, I got some bad news.

Bad news?

I'm not gonna be able to make the showcase.

Oh, you don't know what I've been through for you.

I know.

I'm sorry. I gotta go out of town.

I have a family emergency.

I need more of an explanation than that.

What's happening?

It's my mother.

I thinks she's dying.

I'm sorry.

You know, as soon as I get back,

maybe we work something else out?

I have a record deal on the line for you tonight.

You better get your priorities straight.

You know what?

I do have my priorities straight.

That's why I gotta go.

See you around, Rocco.

Nice to meet you.

It's gonna be okay.

(calming instrumental music)

(birds chirping)

Hi, mama.

Mama's been praying for you to come home.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
(women crying)

I'm glad you came.

(phone ringing)

Hello?
Hi.

Mom.

Tony, is that you?

Where are you?
Gimme the phone.

Wait, wait.

Let me talk to Tony.

Yeah, you're doing okay?

Yeah, I'm sorry I called.

It's been a lot.

I'm sorry it took my so long.

It's okay. It's all right.

I just wanted to tell you how much I love you.

I know.

And I'm sorry. Forgive me for being so tough on you.

I know I've been wrong.

Please remember, keep god with you, sugar.

I will.

Anything that you ask,

and believe,

it'll be yours.

I promise I will.

I'm not ready for you to go yet.

I'm not ready for you to go yet, mama.

It's okay.

It's too soon!

I get to sing for Jesus.

You remember that old song you used to sing,

when I was five?

Every times.

That's the one.

I wanted to give in,

times I thought life

wasn't worth living.

But that still, small voice whispered.

You can make it too.
You can make it too.

Somehow.

I'll always made it through.

It's a slow, uphill climb.

Reaching for the top.

And when I get there,
(women whispering)

But that still, small vice whispered,

you can make it too.

Mama?

No, mamma, please.
(woman crying)

Stay with me, mama.

Please.

No.

No!
(woman crying)

(somber piano music)
(radio chatter)

Another arson?

(upbeat hip hop music)

Yo, we need to talk.

We need to talk.
Hey, yo,

Hey, we need to talk. We ain't doing no more fights, man.

That was the last one.

Yo, let me tell you something, like I said before, man.

Fuck the cycle, man. That shit is weak.

Hey, yo, we aint doing no more fighting.

You're too close to home, yo.

You still here, wanna fucking fight,

Hey, cut this shit out, man.

(horns honking)
(upbeat hip hop music)

(upbeat jazz music)

Did you hear from her?

No, not yet.

She probably still thinks I'm locked up.

She's probably just going to be freaking out.

You in jail, and the whole deal with the mom.

She'll be okay.

We'll be okay.

Once she gets back up here,

we're gonna make a right.

No more jail shit.

No more legal shit.

How's Bubba?
(man laughing)

You know, life man,

just when you think you know,

it has like, this balance.

No matter how much good you do,

you do one, wrong thing, and bam.

You gotta pay for it.

I found that out the hard way.

That's that whole karma thing.

You can't mess with that.

It comes right back to you.

I wish there was something I could do.

Something, something,

to make all this shit we went through worth it.

(knocking at door)
Do you know why

he called this meeting?

So, what's up man?

Word came down. We have to keep an eye on Khaleel.

Look, I don't have a problem with Khaleel.

No, my brother, you do have a problem with Khaleel.

If we have a problem with Khaleel,

you're part of this organization,

you have a problem with Khaleel.

I mean Khaleel's lost his damn mind.

He's going around burning down buildings now.

He's outta control.
Khaleel

has to be under control.

All right. Fine.

I'm down for whatever.

I'm in.

So we'll make that work.

You need to be at home by the phone right now.

It's your only way of getting in touch with her soon.

Yeah.

You're right. You're right.

Listen, thank you for looking out.

If you need anything, let me know.

All right?

Take care, bud.

(man sighing)

(intense music)

(men struggling)

You're gonna die. Come on!

Huh, you steal those white boy?

It's time for you to die, boy.

It's time for you to fucking die.

My dream is to choke a cracker real slow.

It's time to slay a white devil.

It's your time, and your time is up.

(man grunting)

Yo, Khaleel!

Let him go, man!

This shit aint right!
No, man.

Fuck that, man!

White men rule the world,

use the media to condemn the black men and women.

I'm gonna make an example for his ass!

This is our time.

This is what it's all about!

Come on!

Get the fuck off me!

Don't y'all get it?

This is our time, man!

Don't y'all understand what I gotta do here?

This is for us.

For the new, black revolution, man!

We gotta have a new vision that are doing it for us, man.

You've gotta see what I'm trying to do for y'all!

What I wanna do for y'all!

This is our time, man.

Why you guys always working against me, man?

That's fucked up.

Please. Don't raise against me.

That's not what we about, man.

Please.
You fucked up.

Yo, where's Rocco at?

Oh, I haven't seen him.

Actually. He should be here in a minute though.

Man.
You looking for Rocco too?

Real Soul? Get out!

Yo. Y'all got the bomb shit happening.

Yo, matter of fact.

Fuck the tape, man. Yo, check this out.

Boom. If it's rhymes you want,

then it's rhymes I got.

Make sure they platinum plus.

Beat solid as a rock.

Never sampling for number click for you to my own track.

Some showing jealousy and try to hold my shit back.

Never that black. Picture that,

slacking in my game.

My niggas wouldn't go for that.

Nah, that would be insane.

I'll be ashamed to grab a mic, and cook, and rip it.

That's like you fronting me, for that, nah.

Man, you got a lot of talent my man.

Oh, thanks yo. Thanks.

I like that.
It's your lucky day.

You know what?

I got this group, The Three Reasons.

Yo, I heard of them.

It'd be nice for you to come out.

You know, just bring them out.

What do you think?

Olly, I didn't know you're into rap.

(man laughing)
Here's my card.

Give me a call about a 10:30, 11 o'clock tomorrow.

No doubt, man. No doubt.

It was nice meeting you, man.
