WOMAN: The golden age had ended,

and ended badly.

Humankind and cyborgkind
had ceased to be partners.

For 200 years they had built us
to be their friends,

do their bidding, fight their wars,
cook their food

and share their beds.

But the last of the great
corporations was dead and gone.

And with its passing
began the dark time,

when the humans hunted us
for our parts,

our circuitry. . .and our souls.

And no-one was safe.

( BEEPlNG )

l've got him! Let's go!

Arggh!

Hello, hello, hello.

What we got here, eh?

Please, mister. . .
l'm just a poor dirt farmer.

You don't want me.
l've got a wife and a family.

FARMER: Please let me go.

No, no. Wait.

l've got friends. They're
just what you're looking for.

l'll take you straight to 'em.

Oh, really, squire?

Yes. For a very reasonable price.

Oh.

(Mechanical voice) Please don't.

You're decreasing my vision
capability by 50%.

You're making a mistake.

l can't take you to my friends
without my eyes.

C YBORG: Please don't.

You know, there's two things
l hate - that's a liar and a beggar.

Finish him, Jocko.

( THUD! )

( BlRD CALLS )

Spare parts
and pocket money for a week.

l tell you, Jocko,
the picking's getting slim here.

lt's time to move on
to greener pastures -

the free zone.

The free zone's off limits.

To the right man
no place is off limits.

l mean, just imagine it -

500 square miles
of unpoliced terrain.

lt's a cyborg haven
and a recycler's dream.

Somewhere out there
is the mother lode.

Cytown.

Like the fabled
elephants' graveyard of old.

With enough cyber parts and pieces

to put an old recycler right in
the lap of luxury for life.

All we've gotta do is find it.

No-one else has.

What makes you so sure it exists?

Oh, they've found it alright. . .

..they just haven't lived
to tell the tale.

( PHONE RlNGS )

Yes? Lord Talon here.

Hello, Lord Talon. How are you
this fine and lovely day, sir?

Excuse me, but may l ask,
who the hell am l speaking with?

Anton Lewellyn, sir.

Coming to you live from
the fringes of the vast wasteland.

Ah, yes. Thank you.

The one-eyed Jack, hmm?

Well. . .what do l owe this pleasure?

Well, l have
an extraordinary opportunity

that l believe, sir, will fetch
a rather handsome price.

Oh, yes, like the last one.

l'm still trying
to recoup my losses.

Oh, Lord Talon, how was l to know

that the unit had a glass shadow
explosive implant in him?

Well, don't worry, Mr Lewellyn.

Why don't you bring
the opportunity by?

l'm sure we can do some business.

Looking forward to seeing you, sir.

Yes, l . . . l'm looking forward
to seeing you too.

( DEVlCE BEEPS )

Mm-hm.

Thank you.

Could you. . . polish this one?

(Grunts with effort)

Ah, nice. . . nice jump ship.

What year? What year?

Arggh! Ow!

Oh! Spare parts. Have mercy.

Hey, watch the coat!

Aw, jeez, Recycler, anything you got!

Cerebral cable, syn flesh.
Will work for chips.

Oh. . .oh, Recycler.

Spare parts. Have mercy!

Recycler! Lend me your ear.

Perhaps just a finger!

Now, that's a fair request.

Jocko, give the man a finger.

( SQUELCHlNG )

Oh, come, come, Lord Talon,
it's good stock.

Don't force me to go elsewhere.



Ah, but, Mr Lewellyn,
as you can see, it's got no eyes.

And to quote an old parable,
take it or leave it.

(Cries out)

Perhaps you were right -

perhaps l'm paying you too much,
you ignoble recycler.

(Cries out)

At first l really missed my own hand.

But, you know, in time l found that
this new one had certain advantages.

A manicure only took half as long.

And at 1 2lb of pressure l found that
it made a very acceptable manacle.

Well, don't you think?

(Cries out)

At 20lb it will make you scratch
your testicles till you bleed.

(Lewellyn cries out)

At 20lb, well. . .
it stops the circulation.

At approximately 50lb
l'm advised it will crush the bones,

and at 60lb,
you will leave your hand with me.

Arggh!

Arggh!

And l see it also conducts
electricity too, uh?

( GUN FlRES )
ARGGH !

Well, la-di-da.

lt's good to be back
in civilisation, eh?

(Woman groans)

WOMAN 2: You looking for
a good time?

Recycler, come and get
a piece of me. Come on.

You looking for a good time?
WOMAN: Come back here.

l'll take you both on.

WOMAN: Screw you,
you silicone bitch. He's mine.

Ooh, you a big one.
Oh, man, it's a barbarian!

Come on, come on, big guy.
Come on, pull my stick!

Try a trick with my stick! You can do
it. Come on, big guy, you can do it.

Come on, big guy. Come on,
try your luck. Ooh-ooh.

Your money's welcome here,
recyclers aren't.

Oh, don't worry, lovey,
l'm not collecting.

l just want to use them for a while.

Perhaps you'd like to
use a real woman.

No, thank you, my dear.
l prefer a turn-on l can turn on.

Well, well.

WOMAN: Hello?

Hello?!

Doc Edford?

WOMAN 2: Who is it? Who's there?

lt's me - Cash.

Oh, Cash!

How are you, dear?

Oh! What brings you to Silica?

Where's Colt?

Um. . .

..Colt died.

Oh.

l'm sorry.

Oh, it's just a matter of time,
you know.

That's the way it is
with us humans -

they just don't build us
the way they used to.

He was a good friend.

To us both.

( MACHlNERY BEEPS )

CASH: l've never felt
this way before.

All my sensors read hyponormal.

Easy, dear. No need for panic.

Oh, your fluid levels are low.

Something's sucking the energy
from your reactor cells.

A plumbing problem?

lt all started
the day l buried Colt.

Now l feel it in my gut works
every morning.

( RAPlD BEEPlNG )


lt can't be.

But. . .well. . . in all my years
of staring at these screens

l never thought l'd live
to see THlS day.

l mean, if you were human maybe,
but. . .

..well, see for yourself.

EDFORD: Oh, there is definitely
a second heartbeat.

l don't know how or why,
but you're pregnant.

Well, get rid of it.

lt's taking down my power -
l can feel it. Take it out of me!

l don't know how.

Well, l wouldn't even know
where to start with you.

l could kill you.

lf you don't. . . lT will.

May l have your card, please?

Oh.

( BEEP! )

Ah. . .

..Anton Lewellyn.

You've purchased
the full treatments.

Mmm.
l am Elexia.

What would you like to do first?

My, my, my, ducky,
l wouldn't know where to begin.

Then why don't we make ourselves
a little more comfortable?

Come and sit on the couch.

Hmm.

You're so strong and powerful.

Oh, now, now, now.
l bet you say that to all the lads.

l've been with 51 ,227 men.

Hmm.

But l noticed you
the moment you walked in.

l felt your power then. . .and now.

l can see it in your eyes.

What may l call you?

Call me. . .

..master.

Well, master. . . let's get nasty.

Oh. . .

..by all means.

But why?

l'm here for your pleasure.

And my pleasure it will be.

( lNSTRUMENT WHlRRS )

l bet you never had
a fellow like me before, eh?

l got a better idea.

Well, this won't hurt a bit, lovey.

Or maybe it will.

l'm not programmed for this.

lt's a mistake.

Well, don't be so sure.

l mean, clearly,
you do have the hardware.

Who knows what your creator intended?

Here, take this.

You can monitor your energy drain.

lf you start to get into the red
then you can just. . .

lsn't it already too late?

Oh, no, no.

l'm thinking, there is a man.

He's, um. . .well,
he used to be some sort of a. . .

..visionary programmer -
a genius from the golden age.

He lives in the zone, way out in the
north-west quadrant of the badlands.

His name is. . . uh. . . .

..Evans.

Baby. . . he may be your only hope.

( BEEPlNG )

Pardon me, miss,

but we're strangers here

and l was wondering
if you could tell me

where a couple of hungry gentlemen

might be able to satisfy
their appetite.

Sorry, l wouldn't know. Excuse me.


l was about to ask
if you'd like to join us.

l can't.

Well, maybe you'd care
to reconsider, eh?

l wouldn't count on it.

Perhaps another time, uh?

lnteresting young woman, eh?

She's no woman.

A cyborg?

What the hell is she doing driving
around the streets all alone?

lmagine the price she'd fetch, uh?

You know, Jocko,
l feel a pain coming on.

Sorry, Doc,
we don't have an appointment.

But we are in need of your services.

Well, you. . .

..don't exactly fit
my typical patient profile.

Most of them have more balls
than the two of y. . . Ah!

My, my, my, my, my.

Whatever has happened
to professional courtesy, huh?

Of course, you see, Doc, my associate
and l, we're doctors too.

Specialists in removing unwanted
problems like yourself.

So perhaps maybe you could
use our services, eh?

Not if you were the last
one-eyed freak on earth.

Jocko, help the lady up.

(Cries out)

Now all you have to do
is allow me to remove

a little something that's been
gnawing at your insides.

Or perhaps you might tell me what
the cyborg woman was doing here, eh?

She came to the wrong place.

l have never seen her before.

Oh.
l could not help her.

You know, my associate here,
he doesn't believe in anaesthesia.

So perhaps. . .you'd like
to help yourself.

She's just an old worn-out model.

She wanted some replacement parts.

l didn't have any
and l sent her away!

Well, where's her owner?

l have good reason to doubt
YOUR credentials, sir.

No, really?

Oh, you disgust me,
you one-eyed jackal.

Jocko.

(Cries out)

Arggh!

( THUD! )

My, my, what do we have here?

The price just went up.

CASH: Who are you?!


You're backstage
at the edge of creation.

Are you Evans?!
Are you cyborg or human?

Does it matter?!

Actually, no. l've pretty much had it
with the set and the subset.

Are you Evans?!

Repetitive interrogative
serial strain.

You should have that checked,
you know.

Hey! My name is Cash!

Hey! Wait! Please,
l have to talk to you!

l need your help.

You have no idea what you need -
no ideas at all.

You haven't had an original thought
since the nanosecond you came online.

l know l don't like you.

Yes, well, that's hardly
an original thought,

but it's good programming
for 60-year-old gear.

CASH: Dr Edford in Silica
told me how to find you.

Sorry, the repair shop's
permanently closed.

Something is draining my power.
There isn't much time.

l can't help you.

Edford thinks l might be pregnant.

That cannot be.

No. No.

no prototypes had ever been built.

Ever.

Relax, l've done this 1 ,000 times.

There you have it -
an onboard in-vitro chamber.

lncredible. A cybernetic womb
and a cryogenic sperm bank.

lt's all here in your schematics.

Now that we know what it is. . .
get it the hell out of me.

You're creating another life.

Right now something is
growing inside of you.

You're going to be a mother, Cash.

Maybe they were right.

Maybe you don't have
the emotional wet works.

You're not just a cyborg anymore!

No.

Now you're a creator.

lmagine - humans
and cyborgs together.

And you're the
metallurgical earth mother -

the beginning of it all.

Yeah, well, l don't want to be
the beginning of anything.

You have no choice.


What have you got on the bloodhound?

Steady RADAGEN trace.

Not strong, but enough
to keep us locked on her.

How many hours lead?

At least 20.

Well, it's only a matter of time
until we catch the little bitch.

And then?

Well, as much as l'd like to
rip her bloody wiring out by hand,

this one's different.

Why do you do this?

Well, it's my ministry.

My calling, you might say.

( BEEPlNG )



What took you so long?

RADAGEN trail stops
at the edge of the canyon.

Either she went in
or she's right below us.

You nearly killed yourself
and the baby as well.

How is it?

lt's fine,
in spite of your best efforts.

l'm sorry.

l'm afraid. l just thought
l could shut it off somehow.

lts survival instincts
are as strong as yours and mine.

lt created a power surge
to save both of you.

lt was a warning.


( ALARM BEEPS )

What's that?
Expecting anyone?

Recyclers. Two of 'em.

l thought l lost 'em
a couple of days back.

Nice of you to let me know
you were being followed.

What have they got?

Jump ship.
Artillery and heavy armour.

How far out's your perimeter?

Half a mile. Follow me.

We're on it, Jocko.
Won't be long now, my boy.

What the hell is that?

Adequate defence.

explosive heads?

All l know is that they'll stop
practically anything.

My experience with it,
however, is somewhat limited.

Great. Get out of the way.

Fire in the hole.

We're under attack.

What the hell are you talking about?
l don't hear a bloody thing.

CASH: Maybe not.


Hey!

So, where are we going?

To the only place the two
of you will be safe - Cytown.

l thought that was just a myth.

No, just a well-kept secret.

So, do you know where this place is?

Not exactly,
but l know how to find it.

That way.

JOCKO: We're still going after them?

LEWELLYN: Of course, but not alone.

lt's time we rekindled
some of our old alliances.

They're headed to Cytown,

Are you OK?

Yeah, l'm alright.

You're overheating.
Shut down and let me take over.

No-one drives my cruiser but me.

What's wrong? What's happening?

l don't know.

Check the gauges.

Everything reads normal.

That's what l thought.
Get out quickly and run.

What for?
Just do it!

You don't understand. l can fix it.

Oh, well, what in the hell
are we gonna do now?.

We are stuck in the middle
of nowhere!

We've got two recyclers on our tail,

my cruiser just bought it,

and if we don't find this figment
of your misguided imagination

we will be next!

But we're not searching anymore.
We're here.

What is this -
some kind of force-field?

They got a scrambler that
jams unshielded electronics.

lt cooks an engine's microprocessor,
hence the fireworks.

So you drove my cruiser into this
knowing it would explode?

Well. . .you see, l didn't exactly
know where the force-field was.

So, l mean,
we had to find it somehow.

Right?

EVANS: Look, l know you're fading.
l'm fading too.

lf we can just go a little longer,
we're nearly there.

Oh, we're nearly there.

That's what you said 1 0 hours ago.

how wide the perimeter was.

Obviously.

Now l know.

Much, much better. Thank you.

Heh.

Maybe we should let Doc Evans
stick around for a while.

Thank you.

They can't stay!

They'll be the end of us all.

Bold words for a newcomer.

She's not exactly one of us.

And if the recycler
who did this to me is after her,

he will not stop until
he gets what he wants.

He's already killed a woman.

A doctor.

ln Silica.

Doc Edford?

Why would a recycler kill a human?

Because of me.

He knows. He must know.

ALL: Knows what?

l'm pregnant.

How is that possible?

Absolutely amazing.

The technology's
been around for 1 00 years.

lt's just never been done before.

The newcomer's right.

We can defend ourselves against
a couple of bounty hunters.

We've done that before.

But broken-down cytrash like us

don't stand a chance
against the army of recyclers

that's sure to come.

They'll dismantle us all.

l say we get rid of them.

Before the recyclers get rid of US.

We can't just send them out
to be slaughtered.

We don't owe them anything!

Yes, we do. He's a creator.

42.957% of the units
walking around this town

were built from his designs.

Each and every one of us
owe our existence to this man

or someone like him.

ELEXlA: And what about her?

Yes, she's a cyborg,

but something incredible
is happening here

and every one of us knows it.

She is the first of our kind
to become one of their kind.

We're all part creator
because of her -

and that makes me feel proud.

She is living proof that
we are not just a machine.

She is our future.

lf she dies, we all die.

We must protect her
to save ourselves.

Can you help her?

l want to thank you, my friends, for
showing up on such a short notice

and l see you're all here.

Johnny and Jimmy O'Hara -
how's things in Silica, eh?

And Jean-Pierre.

l see you brought all your bad boys.
Excellent.

And, Gunther, you redesigned
those slaughter wheels, eh?

GUNTHER:
The more firepower, the better!

MEN: Yeah!

Good. We're going to need it.

But first, gentlemen, let's get
down to the business at hand.

Over those hills lies a treasure
beyond your wildest imagination.

Now, you've all heard of it
and you've longed for it.

Yet most of you doubted
that it ever even existed.

Yet l alone found it

and together we're gonna
share in the wealth.

MAN: What are you yapping about,
Lewellyn?

Cytown, my boy.
The capital of the free zone.

A metropolis of unowned cyborgs
just wandering around,

clear and free.

Easy pickings, eh?

MAN:
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

MEN: Yeah!

No, hold on, not just yet.

There's still some loose ends
that gotta be tied up.

Meanwhile, Jocko and l have acquired
some of Silica's finest brandy

and there's plenty for all.

So we'd like to ask you lads
if you'd like to join us

in a wee bit of a drink
before the slaughter, eh?

(Men whoop and cheer)

This is as close to a lab
as we've got.

lt'll have to do.

A pregnant cyborg -
it makes you think.

Do any of these surgical gear work?

Well, we don't know.

We've collected tons of junk
from around the zone,

but, then again, we're not creators.

What about that?

Force-field's core.

Here as long as any
of us can remember.

Created by the founders
of Cytown for protection.

Advanced units, l imagine.

Well, as a manner of speaking. . .

Then again, they didn't give us
the ability to fix ourselves.

Most humans don't
possess that ability.

lt takes a vision
that very few possess.

l have a vision.

l dream of one day
being able to stand on legs.

To walk again.

Doc, you think maybe you could
help an old unit who's. . .

Sure, Hale, of course.
l'll do my best.

You're not the only one
with a dream.

Do you know what it's like
to be programmed to be a hero

and not have the ability to fight?

l still have sensations in my
trigger fingers that aren't there.

l know. l know what it's like.

Just once to hold a sword
in my hand again

and fight the way l once did.

There was a time
l lived to build cyborgs.

l was in awe of what
you could accomplish.

Faster, stronger - more perfect
than l ever dreamed of being.

l envied every single one of you.

l haven't felt that way
in a long time.

Arggh! Ohh!

Quick - get her up.

(Cash cries)

What's happening?
Help me!

Guys, you're gonna have to clear out

and give me some room to work,
please.

Not you, Decaf.
You stay and connect her.

(Cash cries out)

Oh, my God. l don't believe it.

What is it?

She's going into some kind of labour.

But how can that be? She's only
been pregnant a few weeks.

Cash, try and relax.

Shut down all non-essential systems.

Trust me to get you through this.

Something is definitely wrong.

What will you do?

l don't know.
We're gonna have to open her up.

Evans, please.

Evans, please. . .

Cash, relax.

OK, release your abdominal plate now.

Doc, what is it?

lt's the end of the first trimester.

A baby?

A miracle.

(Men exclaim)

You OK?
Yeah.

Come on, get up.
(Man groans)

Oh, that hurts, man.

Lewellyn, we've found
the force-field.

lt fried the bikes, so we're walking.

Come on, let's go.

Come on, come on.

Where's the baby?

Yeah, we wanna see the baby.

The baby is still in the incubator.

Well, bring him out.

He's beautiful.

When's he gonna
come out of that thing?

Uh, not for a few months.

lt's a womb with a view.

Cash, what does it feel like?

There's no program for it.

This is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to us.

No, it's not!

lt's the worst.

lt'll be the end of us all.

They're gonna come for it

and they'll take us
all down to get it.

Yeah, when that time comes,

we'll just have
to be ready to fight.

With what? Hooks and claws?

Wheelchairs and canes?

l don't think so!

Look, Jocko, we've got
to get beyond that force-field.

You're the only one
that can get close enough

to find it and bring it down.

They'll never suspect
a cyborg coming in on foot.

Just be one of them.

Why?

Well, it's nothing personal.

Now you're a freak like them!

WOMAN: What's he?

MAN: That's a series 2000 -
he's a warrior.

That's cool, no problem.
So, anyway. . .

Hey, it's the orb.

( DOOR RATTLES )

What'd you bring me?
Look inside.

The baby? Outstanding, Jocko.

They've gotta come after this.

Cytown. . . is gonna be mine.

And, Jocko -
not a word to the others.

What are we supposed to do -
glue it back together?

None of us knows
how to repair the force-field.

The founders gave us
more credit than we deserve.

Cash is gone. So is her gear.

Forget about her.
We got bigger problems.

The force-field's down

and the way l see it,
it's all your fault.

Doc can fix it, can't you, Doc?

l don't know.

l don't know.
The technology is so different.

You don't have any schematics
or back-up gear?

Lost to the ages.

Like l said, the force-field's
been here longer than any of us.

l knew this was gonna happen.

We're doomed.

Now there's nothing
to stop the humans

from coming in here
with their machines.

Forget about the force-field!

You're not gonna bring that back!

You people don't seem
to get it, do you?

The future of your entire race
depends on Cash and the baby!

You've gotta bring 'em back!

He's right. We gotta find them.

Look, if Cash doesn't reach
that canister in time,

the baby is finished -
it's pure and simple!

l say we round up
every fighting unit in town

and we take them on head to head.

Odds of victory
implementing that plan are 0%.

Well, l think l can
improve those odds.

Fix the force-field, human -
or we're doomed!

Maybe l can fix it.
l'll do what l can. . .cyborg.

( FLOOR CREAKS )

( BOOM ! )

Rise and shine, lovey.

Now, tell me - what were you doing
trespassing on my vehicle, eh?

Where's my baby?

The little rodent is just fine.

Ah, you see, Jocko,

how refined the mothering
instinct is in this programming.

Touching, eh?

l wonder if we could
find out just how you work.

l'm not afraid.

Do what you want.

Oh, no, no, no. Not quite yet.

These goods are much too valuable.

l'm just gonna have to find me
another toy in Cytown.

l'm what you came for.

Just keep me.
There's nothing else for you there.

How naive.
You're just the tip of the iceberg.

Before l'm through,

l'm gonna have my way with
every one of you simple machines.

Make no mistake about it -

l'm the meanest bastard
you'll ever meet, cyborg or human.

You push me and no matter how much
you're worth, l'll wipe your memory

and make you a pleasure unit.

My own pleasure unit.

Jocko, watch our inventory.

More to follow, darling.

How can you betray your own kind?

Lewellyn is my kind.

No! You see what he is, what he does!

lt's what l do.

ls it really?

Try to remember what you were
before he wiped your memory.

lt doesn't matter.

Lewellyn owns me now.

Are you just taking orders?

How long will that last?
You will be next!

Don't you see?

As soon as your parts become more
valuable than your services,

he will take pleasure in ripping out
your eyes and selling you for scrap.

Search deep inside your software,
inside your soul. . .

l . . . l can't. . .

..do it. l . . . l can't.

Let me help you.

Connect with me.

Jacques Denard. Cyteck 2400.

Classification - medi-rescue.

Online activation - 4/2/21 96.

Service record - 227 rescue missions.

1 ,24 7 successful field surgeries.

Status - illegal removal. . .

..9/27 /21 46.

Jacques, you were stolen!

You used to save lives.
Do you remember?

l don't know how anymore.

l can teach you.

Take me to my baby.

l can't.

Lewellyn would shut me down.

Jacques, l'm afraid too.

l'm afraid my baby's going to die.

Please help me save him.

lt's what you were programmed to do.

l don't want him to die.


l'm no cyborg.

l'm no cyborg.

l'M NO C YBORG!

l'm no cyborg yet!

l'm a human being.

l'm a human being.

l'd forgotten l was programmed
to imagine such a possibility.

lt feels good, doesn't it?

Yes.

My, my, my!

l spy with my good eye that one
of us might need a tune-up, eh?

Cross me again, Jocko, and l'll sell
your carcass to the highest bidder.

Arggh!

Stop her! Stop her!

Recycle that.

Come on. l'm gonna
get you out of here.

l would imagine they will try
and come in through this canyon here

because it has the lowest. . .

Thank God! Are you alright?
How's the baby?

We've both lost a lot of fluid.

Yeah, you're too weak
to transfuse now.

We're gonna have
to hold off until later.

Look, he's coming
and he is not alone.

He's built a strike force.

His jump ship, a few sand rails
and desert bikes at least 50-strong.

And he's not just coming for me.

He wants us all, dead or alive.

They're not taking me alive.

l'm never going back.

She's right. This is our home.

lf there's to be a next generation,

we have to make a stand.

We all have to fight. . .together.

Alright, gentlemen, listen up.
Here's our strategy.

Jean-Pierre, you and your lads
will come in from the east.

Gunther, you and your boys
will come up from the south.

Meanwhile, Jocko and l will
roar down from the north.

We'll all meet
in the middle of the dry lake bed

and then we'll converge on Cytown
like a tongue of fire from hell!

We'll take them by surprise.
They'll never know what hit them.

But keep one thing in mind -

the bitch and the canister,
they belong to me.

(Men whoop and cheer)

Hale, are you sure
we're doing the right thing?

We've come too far
to turn back now.

But we took an oath.

We never took an oath to die.

Show 'em, El Sid.

That's a significant
amount of firepower.

We've had a lot
of unwelcome visitors.

ls all of this weaponry?
HALE: ln a manner of speaking.

Cyborgs don't exactly
bury their dead.

A cyborg graveyard.

OK, Sid. Just hold still one second.

Almost there. (Grunts) OK.

Oh, this is so exciting, Doc.

How's the arm feel?

lt feels good. lt feels strong.

Stronger than the original, l think.

All you need is a synthetic
flesh sleeve. You'll be fine.

Great!

( TOOL BUZZES )

Now, we have a slight problem.

You're a 260 series,
l could only find a 240 limb, so. . .

Ugh!

l just. . . l don't have
the swivel valve or the joint, l . . .

l'm sorry, Hale, l just. . .
l don't. . . l can't do it.

lt's OK, Doc. You did your best.

Don't worry about my hands, Doc.

Just weld these into my servos.

How's that?

Let's see.

Good job, men.

( BEEPlNG )

Come and get it, you pussies.


Wonder how many men l'll have today.

Firepower improved 400%.

Come and get us.

Odds of victory. . .

..too close to call.

l used to be a pleasure unit.
l'm not anymore.

Oh, come on, now. Come on.

Lewellyn!

Let her go.

Not till l've got
her eyes about my neck.

Jocko!

You're mine now, junk man!

Take 'em.

Take 'em!

Never again.

Are you daft? l own you.

Not anymore.

This is the free zone.

Have you lost your bloody head?

l could kill you right now.

Now, don't force me to.

Now drop that goddamn gun,
metal head!

l said, ''Drop it.''

Drop it!

Now, listen up.

Baby and l,
we're gonna take our leave

and if any of you wretched
androids make one move,

l'm gonna destroy this canister.

Go ahead. Take it.

Destroy the canister.
Do what you want.

We can't all sacrifice
our lives for one baby.

What are you saying?

What's the difference?

Why should a child live in a world

where his parts
are worth more than he is?

Where eyes are worn like jewellery
and life means nothing.

Please, have mercy on my baby.

Destroy the canister.

WOMAN: Cash, no!

You're bluffing.

Take a good look at the future,
Recycler.


The bitch has got some
interesting programming.

Come on, quickly.
We haven't much time - follow me.

lt was the only place to keep
the temperature under control.

l'm not one of a kind,

just the only one to survive. . .

..so far.

CASH: The dark time was over

and a new, golden age
was about to begin.
