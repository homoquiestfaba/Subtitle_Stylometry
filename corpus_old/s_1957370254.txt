<i>Lizzie Borden,</i>

<i>the most famous female
ax murderer of all time.</i>

â™ª <i>Lizzie Borden took an ax â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>And gave her mother</i>
<i>40 whacks â™ª</i>

<i>In 1892,
she was accused of hacking</i>

<i>her father and stepmother
to death with a hatchet.</i>

<i>Now, 129 years later,</i>

<i>for the first time ever,</i>

<i>four paranormal experts</i>

<i>gather to investigate
a dark family secret.</i>

What the...

Lizzie's present too,
but she's waiting.

She is, she's watching.

<i>Rumors of black
magic, the occult, and a dark force</i>

<i>that will forever haunt
generations in life,</i>

<i>And in death.</i>

It's hovering
above me right now.

Oh, my God.

Did you hear that?

<i>Beware
the curse of Lizzie Borden.</i>

<i>I first heard about
the curse of Lizzie Borden</i>

<i>in the winter of 2021.</i>

<i>Rumors that a dark force,
a demonic energy...</i>

Are you hearing that?

Something is knocking on
the underside of the table,

moving around us.

<i>Had been
following</i>

<i>the Borden family
for generations.</i>

I think Lizzie's
present too, she's waiting.

She is, she's watching.

You okay Dave? Yeah, I don't
know what's going on there, buddy.

It's her, just relax.

Are you choosing Dave?

<i>I gathered
together a group of experts</i>

<i>to conduct one of the most
dangerous paranormal rituals,</i>

<i>a seance in the house.</i>

Just trust me, Dave, it's okay.

No, I don't want to let go.

<i>To get to the
bottom of the family curse.</i>

Trust me, Dave, okay?

Chris Fleming, a renowned
psychic medium, will lead the seance.

Take the pen.

<i>His job?</i>

<i>To keep us safe
from dark forces.</i>

<i>Luann Joly,
a local paranormal expert,</i>

<i>who has investigated
the house countless times.</i>

Who are you?

<i>And finally, Sam Baltrusis.</i>

<i>Sam is a direct
descendant of Lizzie,</i>

<i>who believes his family has
been cursed for generations.</i>

Okay, I don't have control of
my arm and I don't like this at all.

I know that, Dave, trust me.
You're okay.

Just pulled into the infamous
Lizzie Borden murder house.

<i>It's been almost a decade
since I was here,</i>

and it's the stuff
of nightmares.

<i>Disembodied voices,
and cries in the night,</i>

<i>footsteps falling
throughout the entire house.</i>

<i>I mean, this house
is clearly haunted.</i>

<i>It's been investigated
hundreds of times, but...</i>

<i>this is the first time
that we're going to take on</i>

<i>the Lizzie Borden curse.</i>

<i>Could there be
a Borden family curse?</i>

<i>And was Lizzie a victim?</i>

<i>Did an evil entity
take possession of her body</i>

<i>and turn her into
a cold blooded killer?</i>

<i>Can the curse be broken?</i>

Hopefully we'll get those
answers during the next few days.

<i>It all began on the
morning of August 4th, 1892,</i>

<i>when Fall River
Massachusetts police</i>

<i>were called to investigate
a murder</i>

<i>at the home of
respected businessman,</i>

<i>Andrew Borden, Lizzie's father.</i>

<i>It was a gruesome scene.</i>

<i>Andrew's face had been
bludgeoned 11 times with a hatchet.</i>

<i>The corpse, still bleeding,</i>

<i>suggesting that he had been
murdered within the hour.</i>

<i>His nose had been completely
severed from his face.</i>

<i>His eyeball left
dangling on his cheekbone.</i>

<i>The bloody scene
continued upstairs,</i>

<i>where Andrew's wife,
Abby Borden,</i>

<i>stepmother to Lizzie
and Emma Borden,</i>

<i>was found lying face
down in a pool of blood,</i>

<i>her head smashed to pieces.</i>

<i>Of the two murders,
Abby's was far more gruesome,</i>

<i>with 18 savage hacks
delivered to her head.</i>

<i>Only Lizzie and the Bordens' maid
were home at the time of the attacks.</i>

<i>Lizzie's responses to police</i>

<i>were at times
strange and contradictory,</i>

<i>and she was immediately
considered the main suspect.</i>

You know, I didn't come
here to solve a crime.

I didn't come here
to put the thumbtack

in the final analysis
of the Lizzie Borden case.

<i>We came here to understand,</i>

<i>could there be a dark force
at work,</i>

<i>feeding off the tortured,
fractured souls</i>

that were left behind
by the Borden family?

Luann. Well, thanks
a lot for coming back.

Shall we get started?
Definitely.

Great, let me give you a hand.

<i>Luann Joly has had
some strange experiences</i>

<i>in the Borden house.</i>

<i>She's even
collected audio recordings</i>

<i>she believes are directly
from Lizzie herself.</i>

This is a...

I gotta tell ya, this is weird.

And I go into a lot
of haunted locations.

This place left
an indelible mark on me,

just walking back in,
already I get this

kind of apprehension feeling
in the middle of my chest.

Can't say it's fear, but it's
definitely uncomfortable.

I mean, you've been
here three or four times.

What are you picking,
just walking back in again?

It's a very intimidating house.

And every time I walk in here,

I feel it emotionally
and physically.

It's heavy.

<i>Could we already be feeling</i>

<i>the dark energy
from the family curse?</i>

<i>Before investigating the house,</i>

<i>let's go over
the murder suspects.</i>

<i>The Lizzie Borden trial
was the O.J. Simpson case of its day.</i>

<i>Everyone talked about this,</i>

<i>but in fact, Lizzie Borden was
eventually acquitted of these murders.</i>

<i>The petite, devout,
and devoted daughter,</i>

<i>could never have wielded
a heavy hatchet,</i>

<i>decimating half of Andrew's face</i>

<i>and pulverizing an equal
portion of Abby's skull.</i>

<i>Or could she?</i>

<i>This definitely
seems like it would be</i>

<i>a case of something
with passion,</i>

meaning this killer was
connected to the family somehow.

<i>And if not Lizzie, then who?</i>

<i>Lizzie's sister Emma
was out of town that day,</i>

<i>but Lizzie and Emma's uncle,
John Morse,</i>

<i>was visiting the family
and claimed he left</i>

<i>before the murders took place.</i>

<i>He was ruled out as a suspect</i>

<i>after he provided
an overly detailed alibi.</i>

<i>There were rumors
Morse dabbled in the occult,</i>

<i>and even allegations of
witchcraft in his lineage,</i>

<i>dating back to the late 1600s.</i>

<i>Could he be the origin
of the Borden family curse?</i>

<i>Did he conjure and bring a
dark force into the Borden home?</i>

<i>Or was he himself possessed
by demonic energies</i>

<i>that drove him to commit murder?</i>

<i>One thing's for sure,</i>

<i>John Morse was strong
enough to wield the weapon,</i>

<i>and he knew how to use it.</i>

<i>He was a butcher.</i>

And a butcher did
also carry something

very similar to an ax.

<i>Or was it someone else?</i>

Who are some of our
other eligible suspects?

<i>What do we know about
Bridget, the housekeeper?</i>

<i>Bridget wasn't feeling
well that day</i>

<i>and ended up going
upstairs and laying down,</i>

<i>when the murders
actually happened.</i>

<i>Bridget was rumored
to be quite protective of Lizzie.</i>

<i>So was there an injustice
that she witnessed in that house</i>

<i>that sparked
this murderous rage?</i>

<i>She's present in the
house and didn't hear a thing?</i>

But we're looking at it again
from a logical perspective,

of here's a crime, here's a
perpetrator, here's how it's done.

We're not taking in,
or maybe most of the world

isn't taking in the possibility
of a paranormal effect.

<i>It's time to investigate
the presence of a dark force.</i>

<i>And I think we're gonna definitely
need some help from somebody else.</i>

I know the guy I might
have to call in for this,

somebody that is a little
bit more in tune to that side.

<i>Chris Fleming has been
a psychic medium for over 25 years.</i>

<i>If anyone can get
in touch and connect</i>

<i>with the spirits or
demonic force in this house,</i>

<i>and get to the bottom of the
Lizzie Borden family curse,</i>

<i>I know Chris Fleming is the guy.</i>

We both had
traumatic experiences here.

Lizzie, of course, is the
main focus of this house,

but I don't know exactly
what we're dealing with,

and how much of it
is projected from her

Mm-hmm.
Or something projecting through her.

And that's why I thought
I could use your expertise.

You've had experiences with the
demonic and very malevolent ghosts.

Are you ready to do this again?

I've been wanting to come back
here for 10 years.

All right, well,
we got a big job ahead of us.

I say we investigate it,

and see if we can
break down some answers.

Luann Joly,
this is Chris Fleming.

Hi, very nice to meet you.
So nice to meet you.

Thank you. Dave told me a
little bit about your situation,

but I'm interested in hearing
what you've been going through.

I feel like Lizzie somehow
wants to communicate with me,

Okay.
But there are so many other spirits in the house,

that it can be
difficult for her,

and sometimes they're violent.

They are very verbal
in this house.

<i>Knowing that there may
be a powerful malevolent force here,</i>

<i>it's time to bring in
Sam Baltrusis.</i>

<i>He's the one person
who has a unique connection</i>

<i>to both the Borden murder house</i>

<i>and the dark energy it holds.</i>

Hey, guys.

I've got a special guest who's gonna join us.
How are you?

Sam, if you'd like
to have a seat.

Sam Baltrusis is a author.

He's written over
13 different books,

and he is actually related
to the Borden family.

<i>I've always been drawn
to the Lizzie Borden case,</i>

<i>but it wasn't until my mother did genealogical
research on her paternal family line,</i>

<i>that we discovered that I'm
twice related to the Bordens,</i>

<i>with connections going back to several
families from 17th century New England.</i>

Now that I know that I'm
connected to the Borden family

and to a lot of crimes
that are horrific,

my mission in life is to
try to find some solution

to help these people heal
in the afterlife.

All right, so here's
the game plan for tonight.

Sam will be rejoining
us tomorrow for the seance,

but in the meantime,
Chris and Luann,

let's do a baseline sweep
of the house.

I'm gonna sit at base camp and
keep an eye on the entire investigation.

I'd really like you to go
along with Luann and observe.

Run your own recorder,

Okay.
And see if you're able to get any

corroborating
evidence with hers.

Luann, you do what you
do best, run your recorder.

See if Lizzie or any of the
other spirits of this house

are ready to come
out and talk tonight.

I'm gonna sit here
and observe from base camp,

but I want you
to both be careful.

You're both sensitive,
you're both open,

and it obviously can affect
you physically and mentally.

We'll gather what tools
you'd like to take up.

Let's see what
we can get tonight,

and what the spirits
have to share with us.

Be careful, let's go lights out.

<i>We have the entire house rigged.</i>

<i>We've got GoPros, we've
got night vision cameras.</i>

<i>We've got security cameras</i>

<i>covering just about
every inch of this house.</i>

<i>If something happens,
we're gonna catch it.</i>

All right, Dave,
see you in a bit.

All right, be safe.

Luann,
I'm gonna follow behind you.

Okay. Good idea.

Luann, when
I was here 10 years ago,

I just want to tell
you this real quickly,

I was standing just
outside this hallway,

and I said,
"Did you do it, who did it?"

Holy.

Did you just hear that?

And I heard
what I believe sounds,

a woman saying,
"It wasn't me."

It was coming
from here in this area.

<i>Wow.</i>

<i>They're now entering
the Abby Borden murder room</i>

<i>where Abby's body was found
bludgeoned next to the bed.</i>

<i>This area right here</i>

<i>is where you get
really disoriented,</i>

<i>and you get
that funhouse feeling.</i>

You kind of don't feel
so good all of a sudden.

<i>Luann is clearly
affected by something in that room.</i>

<i>Let's try something, all right?</i>

<i>I'm going to record,</i>

<i>Abby Borden,
are you here with us?</i>

See how that just beeped
louder when I said something?

Chris is utilizing the Geiger
counter as a form of ITC,

trying to communicate
and have the spirits

influence the energy around
it, in different patterns.

Once for yes, twice for no,

asking questions
and holding up fingers

to see how many
beeps it will give.

<i>Abby, can
you beep four times in a row?</i>

It just hit four!

It just went beep, beep, beep,
beep in a sequence of four.

I have never seen that.

<i>I'll do a quick EVP here.</i>

Go ahead.

<i>Lizzie, do
you have anything to tell us?</i>

<i>Do you have anything to tell us?</i>

Ooh, listen to that.

There is something there.

<i>Do you have anything to tell us?</i>

I'm here.

She said, "I'm here?"

Yeah.

Dave, this is key.

Yeah, I could hear you from
down here. The EVP was really clear.

<i>- You heard it?
Yes,</i>

<i>stick with it, keep going,</i>

<i>you've got something
intelligent responding. Get it.</i>

Okay, let's have
some more questions.

Let's go on to the other rooms.

Chris is getting
some unique... communication.

Appears to be intelligent
in the way

that it's trying
to make itself known.

Okay, now they're in
Lizzie Borden's bedroom.

Go ahead
and ask a question, Luann.

Lizzie, are you here with us?

Did you hear that?

Like from this wall, um...

But that was like direct voice
phenomenon, that wasn't EVP.

What's on the opposite side
of this room?

Um...

Okay, wait a minute,
this is the Borden, the, the...

Andrew Borden's room though...
<i>- Right here, right?</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

I had an experience
here, but I want you

to tell me if you've had
any experiences over here.

Okay.

When I was here 11 years ago,

we came through here and
we smelled, like, rotting flesh.

Like, just, it was horrific.

It makes sense
when I was told later

<i>that one of the bodies
were laid down</i>

<i>on the dining room table
for a while,</i>

<i>so the whole house stunk.</i>

<i>So that would make
sense that this house</i>

<i>probably reeked
of rotting flesh.</i>

Uh, and I just saw,
it was almost like a child,

<i>a little girl that was standing right
here for a second and then vanished.</i>

Um, let me ask.

Was there a little girl
that was just standing here?

<i>I know I saw you.</i>

Speak to me please.

What is your name?

What... What I saw as...
I was talking to Luann,

saw something, corner
of my eyes and as I looked,

it was about this tall,

but it was on this step
or the next step,

like a little girl standing
right here for a few seconds

<i>and then just vanished, gone.</i>

So obviously it was coming
into the room

or standing outside to watch
what we were doing.

It was curious
what we were discussing.

How many spirits
are in this house?

<i>How many
spirits are in this house?</i>

What the...

<i>Whoa, was that a growl?</i>

Wow.

<i>Wow, that
sounded like a demonic growl,</i>

<i>It's as if we angered something.</i>

<i>Let's keep going.</i>

We've got limited time
in that room,

and I would like you to try
to hit the upstairs room

<i>at least for a few minutes.</i>

Now I've never been upstairs.

You haven't?
No.

This room...
I remember this room.

Seems to
have a lot of activity in it.

<i>They're now heading up to
the attic, to one of the maid's rooms,</i>

<i>known to be
a paranormal hotspot.</i>

<i>Well...</i>

if you lay on the
bed, lay across it sideways,

lay on the bed with your legs
hanging open, over the edge.

Okay.
And something will grab your legs,

or it will lift them up,
I've seen both.

So there was somebody
pulled underneath the bed?

Yes.

And it happens
when you're awake.

It happens in front
of witnesses.

Okay.

Who's the one that's
pulling on people's feet?

Whoa, I caught
something fly behind you.

Whoa, I caught something
fly behind you.

<i>Whoa, wait, what was that?</i>

<i>Was that a spirit light?</i>

Yep, it was, like,
right where your hand is.

Come touch my hand.

I'm gonna lean up.

I'm almost certain it was, like, a
white ball of energy or, like, an anomaly.

<i>I'm
almost certain it was like...</i>

Oh, camera's dead.

<i>Dave, my camera just went dead.</i>

That was a brand new
battery, brand new battery.

Why don't we wrap it up
for tonight?

We've got a lot to
go over and discuss.

And uh we'll meet down here
in the, uh, front room again.

Okay, be there in a second.

All right,
so why don't we break down.

We've had a long day,
but before we call it a night,

I'd like to try one more thing.

And that's to take the SLS
camera to the sitting room

where Andrew Borden
was murdered.

This is the area
here that Andrew Borden died.

<i>Chris is using a
specialized light sensor camera,</i>

<i>which will detect human forms.</i>

<i>And sometimes in these
haunted locations,</i>

<i>it'll map out forms that we can't
even see with the naked eye.</i>

<i>Oh! Something's
in the doorway, Dave.</i>

What?

Oh, Now it's gone.
You just walked through it.

Did it?
Holy crap.

Something
just appeared in the doorway?

Yes, and it was small.
You walked through it.

Were you videotaping?
Yes.

<i>Something's in the doorway, Dave.</i>

<i>- What?
You just walked through it.</i>

Oh, jeez, something
just raced right across the room,

a black shadow.

While we're over by the stairs,

Dave, he says out to the spirit,

he says something like,
"Are you here?"

Miss Borden, are you here?

What was that?

Did you just hear the banging?

Yeah, it was just like,
it would have been right here.

Could it have been the radiator?

That's like
two knocks, bang, bang.

Right? Two means yes.
I know that.

That's what I use
for direct response method,

two for yes, one for no,
but it was metallic.

None of us have heard that sound

come from the radiator
since we've been here.

It's a possibility, but
I... I can't say for certain.

That was actually creepy.

All right,
let's call it a night.

We'll get up early,
review the evidence,

and see what we were able
to uncover tonight.

So, Chris, Luann,
and I are spending

the remainder of the night here.

Would you be open to the idea of
spending one of the nights here with us?

Yeah. Oh, my God,
oh, I'd love to.

Okay.

It was definitely
an eventful night,

and I'm so happy
that Chris was able

to join Luann and I
for this investigation.

Something's going on here,

and this being my full night back
in the house to spend the night,

I'd be lying if I didn't say,
there was some apprehension,

but I'm excited to see
what happens.

We'll check in again
with you tomorrow.

Chris is busy analyzing the
evidence from last night's investigation.

So while he's doing that,
I'm gonna have Luann

take me around
the house to review

some of the EVPs
that they captured.

How was your night?

I couldn't sleep well.

Here is the spot where
Abigail Borden was murdered.

Yes.

<i>Even walking in here is...</i>

<i>hard.</i>

<i>And you and Chris
captured more EVP in this room?</i>

Yes.
Okay.

A lot of EVP in this room.

<i>I'll do a quick EVP here.</i>

<i>Go ahead.</i>

<i>Lizzie, do
you have anything to tell us?</i>

Starting here, what did
you guys capture in this room?

I mean, that's really creepy.

You can hear that.

And it's like she's calling
out like she's crying.

"I'm a good daughter."

Yes.

<i>There were always rumors of unspeakable
conduct coming from the Borden home.</i>

<i>Allegations that Lizzie's father,
Andrew Borden, may have abused her.</i>

<i>If true, did years of abuse finally
drive Lizzie to seek vengeance,</i>

<i>and could that blood lust have
spilled out on to her stepmother, Abby,</i>

<i>who really did nothing
to stop the abuse?</i>

<i>In reality, Abby was
Lizzie and Emma's stepmother,</i>

<i>whom Lizzie
referred to as Mrs. Borden,</i>

<i>when she was questioned by
the police.</i>

That particular EVP,
can reverse.

So wait a minute. You've
taken the audio and played it backwards?

Exactly.

What did you capture
or think you captured then?

Well, that's the thing,

it sounds pretty
much like the same voice,

like a woman in distress.

And it's clearer reversed.

If we're hearing Lizzie claiming

or proclaiming her innocence
in the first EVP,

we play it back.

"My daughter was raped."

I mean, I hear it.
I hear it dead on.

That's exactly what's playing
to us right now.

<i>Abigail Borden
was not Lizzie's mom.</i>

<i>Abigail Borden
was her stepmother.</i>

<i>Exactly.</i>

<i>Her actual mother</i>

<i>died when Lizzie was very young.</i>

Could it be the spirit
of her biological mother,

trying to give us some
insight into what happened?

<i>Lizzy seems to be
verbalizing, vocalizing</i>

between the other side
and here, trying to fill us in,

trying to help us understand
what's taken place here.

Sometimes if you stand
right in this location right here,

they want to push you,
push you in that...

Are you okay?
Yeah.

This area right here is where
you get really disoriented

and you get that
funhouse feeling.

Yeah, I kind of don't feel
so good all of a sudden.

Just now, you weren't just
re-enacting that for me.

No, no.
You feel like something's moving you.

Something is moving Luann,
pushing her,

shoving or creating
this disturbance

so she can't feel equilibrium.

There is so much going on.

I don't even know where we begin

to start to discern
who's who, and what's what,

and we're still accepting the
fact that these are human spirits.

The other side is
wrought with confusion,

and dark entities like to take
on the presence of human forms.

And that's what leads to...
possession.

That's what leads
to demonic infestation.

I don't know what we're
dealing with here specifically,

but I'm certainly gonna be
a lot more careful

as we continue to move through this
investigation over the next couple of days.

So I have something really
scary that I want to play for you.

And this, I think might be the
negative presence in the house.

Anvelo.
What is that, a name?

<i>Could this be the
demonic presence in the house?</i>

<i>The very thing causing the
plague on the Borden family.</i>

There is definitely some kind of

oppressive
presence in this house,

and it's starting to make me
very uncomfortable.

And who is it or what is it, that's
really trying to come through?

I have no idea where this is
going. Part of me is excited,

and part of me is
absolutely terrified.

Hey, guys,
Sam is back here with us,

and we've had some
weird experiences here.

Um, Chris, 10 years ago,
myself, 10 years ago,

Ah, activity, sounds,
screams, voices, EVPs.

And we're trying to piece
this together to understand

what's going on in this area

that it is so active
with the supernatural.

And why is it affecting
the Borden family so deeply?

Is there any truth to this Borden
family curse in your opinion?

Well, if you look at
our backstory,

it's definitely a lot of blood,

and a lot of murders that
happened through our history.

<i>Now there is one murder that was
sensational, that happened in 1832,</i>

<i>and it involves one
of my distant cousins.</i>

<i>Her name is Sarah Maria Cornell.</i>

<i>According to Sam,
a Methodist minister,</i>

<i>Reverend Ephram Avery
was strongly suspected</i>

<i>of both the rape
and murder of Sarah Cornell,</i>

<i>and was rumored to be the
father of her unborn child.</i>

<i>She was found hanging from
a stag pole at a nearby farm.</i>

<i>Bruises were later discovered
around her abdomen,</i>

<i>suggesting an abortion
may have been attempted.</i>

<i>Sarah's murder was considered
the crime of the century</i>

<i>until the Borden murders came
about some 60 years later.</i>

He was actually
tried and acquitted,

very much like
Lizzie Borden was acquitted

for the murders
of the Borden family.

<i>Could this be evidence of
a demonic force in the Borden family?</i>

The devil?
Like, that's terrifying to me.

All right, Sam.
Now going back to Lizzie,

do you believe that Lizzie
Borden wielded the hatchet or ax,

or that something else was using
her as a vessel for that murder?

<i>I absolutely think there
was something more sinister at play.</i>

<i>She may have had sort
of a dissociative episode</i>

<i>where she basically was not
in her body when it happened.</i>

I do think she did do it.

<i>However, I don't think that
she was in control of her body.</i>

<i>I do think that Lizzie
is definitely predisposed</i>

<i>to being taken over
by a dark entity.</i>

She does not take ownership
for the murders.

I don't think she will ever
take ownership for the murders.

If she was possessed
and killed her father,

she didn't kill her
father, the devil did.

<i>Do I think
she committed the murders?</i>

<i>I do physically,
but something else did it.</i>

<i>No one would have accused
this small-framed woman,</i>

<i>who was 32 years old, of killing
her father and her stepmother.</i>

<i>That was the perfect person to
take over, and the entity knew that.</i>

Now let's discuss Lizzie

and her sister Emma's uncle,
John Morse.

<i>If there is something
to the rumors</i>

<i>that Morse dabbled in
the occult,</i>

<i>what if Lizzie
practiced with him</i>

<i>and something
took her over then?</i>

And it would explain
too that during possession,

how people get much more
strength, they're empowered.

<i>And that would explain some of
the violent brutality that took place.</i>

What other strange ties
to deaths

and murder and mayhem
do you have?

There was Eliza.

Eliza Darlene, she was a Borden.

She actually married
into the Borden family,

<i>was not blood related to Lizzie
Borden, but her husband was.</i>

Where'd Eliza live?

Right next door.

<i>One fateful day she
actually took her two children,</i>

<i>threw them down a well.</i>

<i>Well, then the question
we need to ask,</i>

<i>is was Eliza possessed by a
demonic force when she did it?</i>

<i>And then she took a
straight razor and cut her neck.</i>

<i>And Dave, I'm telling you,
I'm channeling.</i>

<i>I'm, like, picking
up something right now,</i>

and I'm not really sure who
it is, and maybe it's Eliza.

This seat is like the worst seat
for me to do this, guys. I'm sorry.

Do you need to stand up?

I just don't, yeah, no,

this is like a really
bad seat for me.

You've got a clairvoyant
sitting in the spot

<i>where Andrew Borden
is brutally murdered.</i>

I can understand that.

It's like, I'm a clairvoyant,
I'm a psychometrist,

so I pick up on the energy. So I'm
definitely feeling energy right now.

Let me grab my recorder.
Okay.

While you're talking, even if she's not
fully channeling, if we can get anything.

No, don't apologize, man.

No, no, no,
no, this is what we do.

We're beginning session
number one in the front parlor

at the site
of Andrew Borden's murder.

Sam Baltrusis, you're feeling
something come through you.

What are you feeling, Sam?

<i>I'm seeing a woman, and she's got
beautiful hair. She's brushing her hair.</i>

She loves her children, she
loves her children so much.

<i>Eliza, is this you?</i>

<i>What do you want us to know?</i>

What can we do to help you?

Help my children.

<i>Are your children with
you on the other side, Eliza?</i>

They're here.

And, Eliza, what can we do
to help your children?

What would you like from us?

Keep them away from them.

Keep them away from him.

From who, Eliza?

<i>Are there other energies here</i>

<i>that are tormenting
your children, Eliza?</i>

Yes, yes.

<i>Yes? Are they
tormenting you as well?</i>

Yes, yes, they
won't let me come here.

Are you in danger by
coming here to talk to us about this?

<i>Yes, yes, they
will kill my children, kill my children.</i>

But who are they?

<i>Is she referring
to the dark forces</i>

<i>that could be behind
the family curse?</i>

<i>Did a dark force
make her kill her children?</i>

<i>And worse, does it continue
to haunt Eliza and her children</i>

<i>even in the afterlife?</i>

Chris Fleming
took me aside afterwards

and said, Sam Baltrusis,
he's the real deal.

Things I was picking up on,

he would immediately start
to address and talk about,

I know he knew
what was going on here.

These spirits are
communicating through him,

the Borden bloodline.

They went to Sam Baltrusis.

Wow.

Now, do you feel residual
energy of Eliza with you?

<i>It was definitely
about her children.</i>

And I definitely felt her pain
and she's, she's desperate.

<i>It's like you go
into another world.</i>

<i>You can actually see it through
her eyes, while you're in that state.</i>

<i>So the idea
that she killed her children,</i>

<i>it's not on her conscience?</i>

<i>Maybe she really is desperate
to help those children.</i>

<i>She's desperate to help them
because she believes</i>

<i>the dark entity from the curse
is tormenting her and them,</i>

<i>even in the afterlife.</i>

When you were saying
that they don't protect the children,

that there's something else,

what was it that
she was afraid of?

<i>It was a monster.</i>

<i>That's the only way
she could describe it.</i>

I think that, that people misconstrue
that entity as Andrew Borden,

and I don't think
it's Andrew Borden.

No, it's not.

I think it's something else.

<i>Anvelo has been this
name that keeps coming up,</i>

something very dark
and demonic in nature.

But it's hiding.

Is it hiding because
we're here looking for it?

Because it knows we're gonna
challenge its authority in this house?

And after what happened
to Sam Baltrusis,

channeling, something
coming through him,

claiming to be Eliza,
talking about her two children

being bullied or oppressed
by something dark,

was that Anvelo?

Guys I gotta walk out, I'm having
a hard time breathing. I gotta, I can't.

I gotta get some air.

Yeah, this
is getting really intense.

Oh, my God, I can't
breathe. I have a hard time breathing.

It's like, I'm being choked.

Like oxygen's coming out of me.

It was like the whole bunch
of people are on top of you.

If you've ever had that happen,

like you play games when you were
kids and everybody's on top of you,

you can't breathe, can't
breathe, that type of thing.

There was a restriction
of airflow.

I had to walk out.
I couldn't take it anymore.

I was fighting it
while I was in there.

<i>Okay, we're, we're
obviously seeing evidence</i>

that there is some
sort of malevolent presence

here at the Borden house.

But you know
who we haven't heard from yet

is one of the main suspects
in these murders, John Morse.

<i>Now John Morse
was Lizzie's uncle.</i>

<i>He had visited Andrew Borden
the day of the murders.</i>

<i>And when it comes to motive,
the guy had plenty.</i>

<i>He and Mister Borden
were reportedly overheard</i>

<i>having a heated argument over
money right before the murders.</i>

<i>Plus, there's the matter
of what he did for a living.</i>

<i>He was a butcher,</i>

<i>and a butcher did
also carry something</i>

very similar to an ax.

<i>Well, let's not forget the
rumors that he dabbled in the occult.</i>

<i>What if he unknowingly brought
something into the Borden home?</i>

Sam, is there another place
we can go

to try to actually
connect with John Morse?

Well, you know, there's a place
in the Freetown State Forest,

actually where John Morse lived.

<i>The house is no longer there,</i>

<i>but that would be
the place to go.</i>

Now that we've all
had a moment to breathe

and think about the dark force,

we need to figure
out where it came from.

<i>The idea of
a curse on this family</i>

<i>does it exist as though
somebody specifically cursed</i>

the bloodline of the Bordens?

<i>Do you believe that it's a
genetic passed down curse?</i>

If you look at John Morse's
backstory,

the way he was acting was
very odd the night of the murder.

<i>He normally actually
sleeps on the third floor,</i>

<i>the night before
he actually stayed</i>

<i>in the John Morse room
on the second floor,</i>

<i>where Abby was murdered.</i>

<i>Almost like he was taken
over by something as well.</i>

<i>And there are allegations of
witchcraft in his and Lizzie's bloodline.</i>

<i>I wouldn't be surprised
if whatever he attracted</i>

<i>where he lived somehow it
followed him to the Borden house.</i>

Let's see if we can get some
answers tonight at the forest.

So we're all sure about this?

Yeah, I want to do this.
Let's do it.

Stay together, guys.

<i>This is the exact spot
where John Morse lived.</i>

<i>If he's guilty of these murders
or if he's eternally cursed,</i>

<i>it's quite possible his spirit
is still here today.</i>

<i>We are not alone.</i>

All right,
now everybody stay alert.

<i>If John Morse was
cursed by the Borden family demon,</i>

<i>he might be the actual killer
of Andrew and Abby Borden,</i>

<i>pinning it all on Lizzie.</i>

Who knows what
we're gonna find out here?

We are not alone.

I'm hearing like whispering,
it sounds like little children,

but it's static sounding.

There's definitely
whispering going on.

I'm getting
chanting of some sorts.

You're picking
up on chanting out here?

Yeah. We're not alone.

This is where Lizzie's
uncle's house once stood.

And if the rumors
are true, guys,

this is where he would have
engaged in these occult practices.

I'm getting stuff flying
around real quickly, around us.

I got a little disoriented from
the change in the field over here.

You ask a question.

John Morse,
are you here with us?

Did you kill Andrew
and Abby Borden?

Let me play this back.

Something, here, listen.

"Satan loves you?"

It says,
"Satan loves you."

Why, why would
it say that though?

If you're already
picking up on the same

environmental field that
we have at the Borden house,

is it following us, or are
we just out in its nature?

Obviously something out here is
trying to get into our heads early.

It's protecting its property.
We've come into their area.

Or there was a lot of ritual
that happened out here.

And that's what
I'm picking up on.

I'm picking on
some sort of ritual,

Maybe there's something
that has been opened up.

Did you hear that?

Sounds like something

just walking
around our perimeter.

Do you keep hearing that?

We're being circled,

there's something
is circling around us.

All right, let me I'll
film with SLS. See if we get it.

Now, Chris is again
utilizing a tool called the SLS camera.

It's seeking human form, and what
we find in some haunted locations,

when someone is not visibly
there, it will map in a figure,

and not just an outline
of the figure,

but sometimes it will move and
correspond to what we're asking.

And when it
says "Anomaly detected",

it's picking up on
some sort of human form.

I hate to say it, but I'm
picking up stuff that may be dark,

something was conjured here.

Did you hear
something just whisper right here?

Yeah.
I've been getting voices.

I keep hearing like whispers.

There's definitely
something out here with us.

I'm not sure if it's something
related to John Morse,

or the dark energy conjured
from the family curse.

Whatever it is,
it wants us to break apart

and to follow whatever it is
in the woods.

And it's kind of using,
you know,

I didn't feel
uncomfortable at first

when I first walked here,
but now I do.

Something is very dark and
menacing, lurking in the woods.

So I have my dousing rod.

I'm actually,
my hand is going numb.

Something's very, very,
very, very powerful here,

and it's holding my hand.
Can you show me where you are?

Right over here.

And that's where I was
seeing something walking

and kind of like
circling us over here.

Sam,
why don't you go over there?

Okay.

Now Sam's picked up
on his dowsing rods

that the energy is drawing
him in that direction.

So, Dave, it just said, "Here,"

and it came from above me,
and it sounded very wicked.

It sounded like, "Here".

Uh, so it was very gravelly
and kind of scary.

I feel like I'm being
used as human bait right now,

but I, but I think this is
important to communicate

with whatever's
lurking in the woods.

Oh, my God.

It grabbed my arm, while I was
pushing out, It grabbed my arm.

Oh, my God.

All right stop, everybody just
stop for a second. Hold on.

Direct ahead of you, right
directly in front of you, Chris,

I see two glowing eyes.

Oh, my God.

I've got them
on the camera right now.

I mean, they're there, there's
something there between you two.

That's too far
for this SLS to map.

It looks like it's
maybe 10 to 20 yards tops.

Now they're gone.

Okay, we're gonna try
something here.

Hey, you guys come around,
let's let's make a triangle.

All right, guys,
what we're going to do here

for a couple of minutes,
is DRVP.

I'm gonna use the spirit box.

I got a little bit
of an amplifier here

going into an orbit
speaker, all right?

What I want to do is have some direct
voice phenomenon using the radio.

Spirits, I know you can hear us.

Are you mad that we're here?

Leave.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry?

Yeah. I'm sorry.

John Morse,
is our family cursed?

What's hovering
above me right now?

Satan?

All right, let's do
an EVP session right here.

We can hear you
moving around us.

We come in respect, we're
simply seeking answers and truth.

John Morse, are you the
one that's circling us right now?

Is it true that you dabbled
in occult practices?

Are you angry that
we're in your territory?

Holy crap!
Was that like a drum sound? Yeah.

What the hell was that?

Something just went
running right by my feet.

And then I heard the drum sound.

It went in there,

like through the trees
right across the ground.

All right, play it back.

Get out, listen to this,
get out, listen.

Right there, "Get out."
"Get out".

It was an evil voice.
Let me play this for you.

"Get out", right there.

Well, we definitely made contact

with an evil energy
out here tonight,

but was it that same demonic
force that Sam believes

has plagued the Borden family
for centuries?

Whatever it was, it had a
message for us loud and clear.

Get out.

And it makes our next
step in this investigation

even that much more treacherous.

It's time we sit down
for the seance.

I wanted to talk about
a couple of things

before we even consider
doing the seance,

because we all know
how dangerous this can be.

Our mission has to be to find
evidence of the Borden family curse

to hopefully detect
this presence of dark energy

that's followed
the family ever since.

In the woods, we encountered
a presence calling itself Satan.

Here in the house, we
encountered the demonic presence.

What the...

Something reaches out
from underneath the bed?

Yes.

Including
the demon attached to Eliza.

Keep them away from them.

From who, Eliza?

One of the most concerning
pieces of evidence to me

is one of the EVPs
that Chris and Luann captured

in her first
overnight investigation.

She plays one for me that

really kind of seems very
weird and mysterious, right?

She plays this, and I believe the
question you asked was "who's here?"

And she gets a response.

<i>So this word has been
kind of a puzzle for us.</i>

<i>We can't find any translation
that seems to make sense.</i>

<i>It's not a name that's
associated with this home.</i>

And immediately
what comes to mind

when you hear a name like that?

I automatically thought
demon when I first heard that,

or something that was not human.

But we know demons
don't give up their names,

because when they do,
they can be extracted.

So it's something...

you mentioned that you
wondered if it was an anagram,

or if it was a game
that this thing was playing,

that there was
multiple meanings.

<i>So today I started to try
to break down this concept,</i>

<i>and where are we?</i>

<i>Who walked this land?</i>

<i>And could this
be the dark energy</i>

that's plagued Lizzie's
family for generations?

I did a little bit
more digging and research.

<i>I contacted some
locals in the area.</i>

We know that the Wampanoag indigenous
people were settled in this area.

I wanted to see
if there was somebody

that could explain
the word to me.

And I reached out
to a friend of mine

from the Native American
community.

She was a little stumped,

but she dug through
and found an Algonquin word.

And there's a loose
derivation of this word,

which means, "he died,"<i> ankelo.</i>

<i>- You're kidding.
So,</i>

<i>there's one version
which makes sense.</i>

<i>In this home that we're in, where
a man was brutally murdered,</i>

<i>a woman brutally murdered,
we get, he died.</i>

<i>Then the bombshell hits.</i>

Another friend of mine
comes to me and says,

this is Italian.

And what it's telling you
is, "The veil."

So it's giving answers
in multiple tongues,

which again
seems demonic in nature.

And without explaining
to him what I was asking for,

he goes on to describe, as
in a wolf in sheep's clothes.

I was upstairs and the thing
was coming through,

and I was connecting with it,

and I felt the anger and
then it called me something.

So this thing is
taking the face of many names.

Oh, it's pissed now.
It's pissed.

It just called me a bastard.

And I told the producer,
I said write this down.

I want that piece of paper

in the middle of
the table on the seance.

This thing has many faces.

And that's how it stays
hidden, is it tricks people.

<i>So, could Anvelo
be the dark energy</i>

<i>conjured by the Borden
family curse?</i>

Maybe it's all derivations
of the exact same thing.

That's what this word
seems to be,

<i>something that can plug in
and fit perfectly like a game</i>

<i>this thing is playing with us.</i>

<i>I don't question
that there aren't fragments...</i>

of each one of the people

<i>that have passed
through this house</i>

<i>in the final moments of their
life in panic and in shock,</i>

<i>as they're being
brutally murdered.</i>

<i>That had to fracture, that
had to leave a psychic scar.</i>

<i>Lizzie's name has
been evoked so many times.</i>

<i>How could a fragment of who
she is not be a part of this house?</i>

<i>This is a feeding ground
for dark energy,</i>

<i>because everybody comes here</i>

<i>anticipating the allure
of being in a house</i>

<i>where brutal murders took place.</i>

<i>Some revel in it.</i>

<i>Some worship it.</i>

And it's created a cathedral
of chaos in one place.

So as we decide, if we even want
to move forward with the seance,

we all have to consider the very
real possibility that this dark force,

it may come through,

that the demon
from the Borden curse

may come after each
one of us, personally.

I want to bring something
up with Chris's permission.

Mm-hmm.

When you came to
visit with us yesterday, Sam.

Yeah?

You were sitting on the couch,

we were talking, Chris started to
become very physically agitated,

<i>and in pain.</i>

<i>He had to leave the house
to collect himself.</i>

<i>And you told us,
there's someone here.</i>

<i>I feel it's like a father
force, a father figure,</i>

<i>his dad, Reggie,</i>

and then you paused and you
said, "And there's somebody else".

"There's a health issue
involved, and that's why he's here".

Yeah.

And Chris received
a message today.

Would you share with
the team what's going on?

Yeah.

I just got a call
that my mom collapsed,

and she was unconscious,

and I'm waiting to hear back,
what's the condition.

Then it hits me, going, "My God,

since I've been in this house,
I've had nothing but headaches

because it
doesn't want me here."

So what they will do
is if they can't get at you,

they will go at people
that are close to you.

This is a point
where I think each one of us

need to kind of
sit back and reflect

on how much further
we want to push.

I don't know if we're
getting deeper in danger

for any one of these team
members or somebody we love,

by what we're doing,
in trying to reveal the truth.

That side doesn't want
to be uncovered.

To tell the truth and help
Eliza and her children.

To help the memory
of the Bordens?

Yeah.

Is it worth the cost
to one of us?

Yeah.

All right, we've all had a
little chance to take a breather.

Moving forward.

The concept and idea was
facing this head-on tonight,

and having a seance.

Our hope is to make contact
with the dark energy

and to possibly break
the Borden family curse,

<i>bringing peace to Lizzie
and the other spirits.</i>

<i>Her great aunt Eliza
and her children,</i>

<i>who are trapped or perhaps
being tormented in the afterlife.</i>

We know the dangers,
we know the possibilities,

but we also know why we're here.

This is what we do,

but I want this to be something

that everybody's comfortable
with, and if you're not,

no harm, no foul.

There's absolutely
no love lost between us

if you decide to step away
from this, this evening.

It's time we sift through
the lies.

It's time we sift
through all of the legend

and get to the heart
of this story.

We may have a fight
on our hands.

There is something here that
doesn't want to be interfered with.

Are you okay doing
this tonight, are you in?

I'm in, yeah, I'm in.

Chris?
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

Luann?
Yes.

Let's do it.

<i>We've chosen
to perform the seance</i>

<i>in the actual bedroom
where Lizzie Borden</i>

<i>spent most of her time
in this house.</i>

<i>And if the dark entity
attached itself to Lizzie,</i>

<i>this is where we're most
likely gonna find it.</i>

It's go time,
we are set up for the seance.

I've got the entire
table rigged with GoPros

that will catch action
from every angle.

If the spirit manifests itself,

we are gonna
capture something tonight.

<i>We're about to open
a portal here,</i>

<i>a potential doorway to evil.</i>

<i>This is the most dangerous
paranormal contact for anyone to attempt.</i>

<i>There've been very few seances</i>

<i>actually conducted in this house</i>

<i>because of
those dangers involved.</i>

<i>We're trying to discover
and contact the source of this curse.</i>

Well, we've all
agreed to come here

to try to help the spirits

that are part of
the Borden household,

the spirits that have
reached out for help,

from Eliza and her two children

<i>to Elizabeth
and the Bordens directly,</i>

to see if we can lift
this curse,

lift this burden that's
been put on their shoulders.

We might as well begin.

<i>Each person has an
important role to play during the seance.</i>

<i>Luann has a strong
connection to this house,</i>

<i>In capturing the Anvelo EVP.</i>

<i>Will the demon come out tonight?</i>

<i>Sam is related to Lizzie Borden,</i>

<i>and has channeled the spirit
of Lizzie's great Aunt Eliza.</i>

<i>She drowned her children in
the house directly next door,</i>

<i>44 years before
the Borden murders.</i>

<i>Will she make contact again,</i>

<i>and bring them peace
in the afterlife?</i>

<i>Me, I'm gonna open myself
and my body</i>

<i>to whatever spirits need
to help them.</i>

<i>And finally, there's Chris,
the leader of the seance.</i>

<i>He understands the dangers
better than any of us.</i>

<i>A seance opens a door
to the other side,</i>

<i>inviting in good
and sometimes bad spirits.</i>

<i>They can take over
your body and attach to you,</i>

<i>or in the best case scenario</i>

<i>you'll find out who
or what you're dealing with,</i>

<i>and then close that door.</i>

<i>But we all have to be aware
of the worst case scenario.</i>

<i>When you give
that kind of permission,</i>

<i>anything can
walk through, anything.</i>

<i>Chris's number one job
is to keep us safe.</i>

First thing we do is to
relax the body and the mind,

to loosen the consciousness,

but not loosen the soul
where it leaves the body.

Each one of our souls
needs to stay within the body.

Breathe in,

breathe out.

Breathe in,

breathe out.

People say, "Hey, are you gonna be
able to communicate with this spirit?

Are you gonna be successful
in getting rid of this?"

I don't know till I'm there.

I don't know till
I am facing this thing

<i>and confronting this,
what can be done.</i>

Gonna ask the spirits
that reside in this house,

can already feel
some of your presence,

to not be afraid,
but to come forward,

to speak to us,
we have some questions,

but we also have a purpose.

And I believe
you know that purpose.

Feel free to speak to us.

Are you hearing that?
Yeah.

Something is knocking on the
underside of the table, moving around us.

And moving around the room.

It's multiple.

I think Lizzie's present too,
but she's waiting.

She is, she's watching.

Call Elizabeth.

Elizabeth, is that you with us?

Can you knock the table
if that's you?

Elizabeth, I promised you
that I would not call you here.

This is special,
this is for the children.

This is your chance
to redeem yourself.

You are a good person,
I know you.

I know you, you're a good girl.

You're a good daughter.

It said,
"Back off a second."

Allow it to come through.

You okay, Dave?

Yeah, I don't know
what's going on there, buddy.

It's Elizabeth. It's her.

Are you choosing Dave?

Okay.

Just trust me,
Dave, allow it to come through.

All right?

Just trust me, Dave, it's okay.

No, I don't want to let go.

Trust me.

Trust me, Dave, okay?

Take the pen.

Back off.

No, I don't like this, Chris.
I don't like this.

I don't have control of my arm.

I don't like this at all.
I know that.

I know that, Dave, trust me.
You're okay.

It's just a form
of communication.

I'm holding on.

I know, but it's not used to it.

Slow down, relax.

I can't let go,
I'm not fighting it.

Okay, just let it go.

It's only gonna use
the arm, trust me.

It only has permission
at this moment to use the arm.

This is a form
of automatic writing.

It's very weird.

Allow it.

Calm down, spirit, calm down.

No more.

Okay, what do
you mean by no more?

Yes. No more, okay, I know.

Just relax, Dave.

What do you mean "no more"?

Is this Lizzie?

<i>Is this Lizzie?</i>

I believe that's yes, okay.

Lizzie, I'm here
to help you, okay?

All of us are.

You must tell the truth,

and I know you're tired
of hearing it.

<i>Did you physically do it?</i>

Why does that
feel like it's lifting me?

Just relax, Dave, it's okay.

I know it's scary,
just trust me.

Something's trying
to pull you away, Lizzie.

Something's trying to pull you out.

Come back, you have permission.

Lizzie, did you physically
do it?

<i>Yes or no?</i>

"No," okay.

Was it a demon, Lizzie?

Do you know who did it?

No?

But you're in spirit now,
so you can see,

you can have access
to who did it.

Was it a male that
did it, a male, a man?

Yes or no?

No.

Lizzie, why are
you pointing to me?

No more.

No more.

Okay you're tired of
hearing about it.

<i>I don't know what
this is, Chris. I don't feel it.</i>

Don't worry, okay?

It's only gonna be temporary.

Lizzie, what do
you want to tell us?

Do you want us to stop
bringing up the past?

Is that what you're saying?

<i>I don't know
what the hell that is.</i>

<i>- Lie.
Lie?</i>

L-I-E.

Yes.

Oh, so the past is a lie,
you did not do it.

Yes.

It's okay.

Okay, okay it's okay.

You told me you didn't do it.

I believe you.

Lizzie, stop
for a second, relax.

Okay?

If you don't respect this body,

I have to remove you from it.

Come on.

Speak to us.

I'm trying to,
I just don't like this, man.

It doesn't feel right.

I don't think this is a woman.
I don't think this is a woman.

I don't like it, Chris.

All right, enough.

Enough.

It's all right, brother.

Okay, relax.

Listen, I want you to listen.

This is gonna just linger
for a little bit, okay?

Trust me, give me your hand now.

Sure.
All right.

<i>That's the first time that Dave</i>

<i>has experienced
something like that.</i>

<i>And I've known him for 17 years,</i>

and I believe
one of the reasons is,

<i>Dave is a little
skeptical of mediumship,</i>

<i>channeling, automatic writing.</i>

<i>So Lizzie decided
I'm gonna go through him,</i>

teach him something.

Dave, how are you feeling?
Better?

Just worn out,
and in a lot of pain.

Okay.
I think she's gone.

Let's keep going.

Something's moving around
under the table with us.

Can you feel it? I mean, it's
bumping and moving around us.

It's just to scare you,
it's swarming.

I think it's the dark energy.

It's...

They feed off of fears.

Not nice.

Don't worry.

It's really pissed off.

I know, I know.

Write a word for me. What are
you trying to say? Write a word.

All right.

Relax, Luann.

It's only temporary.

Are you Lizzie?

Yes or no?

It's saying backwards, "Yes."

I don't really like this.

Okay this is,
this is not Lizzie.

Okay, I'm gonna ask you to...

I'm gonna tell you to leave now.

You must leave now.

Listen to me.

Who are you?

You're not human,
you're drawing.

6-6-6. Okay.

She just drew 666 in reverse.

<i>Something started
affecting Luann more negatively.</i>

<i>I believe she was making
contact with that dark energy,</i>

<i>possibly the same from
the Borden family curse.</i>

I think it's Anvelo or
something that infests that home

and takes many guises.

It doesn't scare me.

There is no fear.

I don't know what it needs,

but it needs something and it's not good.
I understand.

I understand that.

I think it wants us to die.

Are you one of the fallen?

It doesn't want to talk.

I know you don't.

It doesn't want to talk.

Of course it doesn't,

it doesn't want the truth,
that's why.

It's time for you to go home.

You've been feeding off of
the regret and fear of others.

You've been
feeding off of the pain of others,

because of the pain that you
have from thousands of years ago.

I'm gonna face this dark energy.

Look at me.

Look at me.

There is no violence
or hate or anger behind me.

All right, this
is what we're gonna do now.

I'm gonna use this spirit box.

I am doing this so
that we can listen in

on the invisible spectrum,

to hear some of the spirits

that are starting
to surround us.

We're gonna do
this together, Sam.

You guys give me your hands.

Now, I asked the Bordens,
their spirits to come forward.

Lizzie, can you hear me?

<i>I feel your presence.</i>

Can you speak to us?

You have permission.

Did you hear that?

Yeah.

I heard there
is a demon in this house.

Whoa, that's confirmation.

The demon is here with us.

Why was this told to me,
the faces of many names,

who is that?

Did it say, "pure evil"?

That just say "pure evil"?

Yeah, pure evil.

<i>There is something out there</i>

<i>that has a shape or a form,
that may change over time.</i>

<i>And that has many faces,
and many names.</i>

<i>And when we say, well,
it's the devil or it's Satan,</i>

or it's this evil person,
how could somebody do that?

<i>Well what is it all?</i>

<i>It's all just evil.</i>

It is now time to confront
this dark energy

<i>and break the family curse.</i>

No other entities are allowed
to enter into this domain.

It's being shut down.

I ask the holy angels
to come forward

and to assist in removing
this infestation,

to wipe clean the past
of the tragedy and the pain.

We're here to call out
to the souls and spirits

<i>that have been
wanting to cross over,</i>

<i>and been wanting
to go home and find peace.</i>

Allow them to come home, to
be welcome with the creator,

to return to peace,

to remove the emotions
and the shame.

Are you okay, Dave?

We just ask that you find
the entity known as Anvelo,

and any other dark manifestations
that may be in this home.

We rebuke them and heal
the psychic scars of the dead.

We ask that the lies stop
and that the truths prevail.

We ask the Borden family
to come forward

and join us in this plea.

<i>We ask that you give
the grace of forgiveness</i>

<i>to Lizzie Borden and her family.</i>

<i>We ask that you
raise the veil of hatred,</i>

<i>anger, suspicion,
jealousy, and rage</i>

<i>that has been put on this house</i>

<i>and break the curse
of the Borden family.</i>

It's Eliza. Eliza.

We invite you into our circle,
Eliza, along with the children.

I hear her saying, "I'm
sorry for bringing you here".

It's okay.
Don't be sorry.

We're here now together.

So much pain.

<i>So much pain.</i>

Did something
influence you, Eliza?

Do you remember that day?

<i>The monster.</i>

Something affected you?

The monster.

Please. Please.

Eliza, are you here
with the children now?

Yes.

Good, see, this is good,
you're together.

There's forgiveness.

Do you see your children
surrounding you, Eliza?

Oh, my beautiful babies.

<i>Right.</i>

<i>- The babies.
Yes.</i>

<i>You don't need to feel pain now.</i>

You're forgiven, your
children forgive you, look.

<i>Look at them,
they surround you in love.</i>

We invite you
into the circle of love.

You have to try
to help a soul be put to rest.

<i>Means to remove
anything keeping them here,</i>

<i>giving them that freedom,
breaking that shackle.</i>

Then the angels are there
to help them cross over.

Eliza, there's a man
with golden hair

<i>that is descending
down into the light.</i>

<i>He's offering his hand to you.</i>

<i>She's letting go of me.</i>

<i>Do not be afraid and go to him.</i>

He will protect
you from the darkness.

He is here for you now.

She's got her arms open wide.

<i>I'm feeling a cold breeze.</i>

These children are so special.

There are more that
are coming out of the light

<i>that are to create a safe
passage for them with you,</i>

<i>to break the bond
from the darkness.</i>

We ask now that
you clear our mind,

our soul and our bodies of any
energies that are not our own,

<i>to cast away anything
that means us harm,</i>

<i>as we end the circle
in light and love,</i>

<i>brothership, friendship.</i>

<i>We thank you for your time, for
the spirits that have come forward.</i>

<i>We beg mercy for those
that are still lost.</i>

And we thank God above for
all that He's brought to us today.

Amen.
Amen.

<i>Today was a great day.</i>

<i>There's a multitude of different
things that happened today.</i>

Each one of us was
obviously brought together

for a specific
reason, for ourself.

<i>Dave had his experience.</i>

<i>Sam had his experience,
Luann had hers.</i>

I had mine, and together,

we had experiences with
a multitude of various souls

that came through,

<i>that in some way
or some shape or form</i>

<i>are connected to this place.</i>

And together we all
collectively experienced it.

<i>Today, we did
what we set out to do.</i>

<i>We made contact
with the dark energy,</i>

<i>hopefully breaking
the Borden family curse.</i>

<i>We made contact
with who we believe</i>

<i>were Lizzie and Eliza
and her children,</i>

<i>and we sent them
all into the light,</i>

<i>where they can finally be
at peace.</i>

<i>There are no coincidences.</i>

<i>Luann, she got this information,</i>

<i>which connected to me,</i>

<i>which connected to Chris,
which brought in Sam,</i>

<i>and we became a unit
that could come together,</i>

with the same ideals,
the same intention

and the same hopes to help.

<i>We followed the breadcrumbs,
the trail of information,</i>

as confusing as it was at times,

to the conclusion
that there is a haunting.

There is a curse.

<i>The curse comes in many layers.</i>

<i>The house where two
horrific murders took place.</i>

<i>The psychic scars left behind
from the murder victims</i>

<i>and the family survivors.</i>

<i>I feel like the work
that we did this week,</i>

<i>definitely took off a layer,</i>

<i>a very dangerous layer
on the Borden family curse.</i>

<i>I knew that I was able to communicate
with spirit and be a clairvoyant.</i>

It went really dark,
really fast.

<i>I knew my ancestors
were behind me, supporting me.</i>

<i>And that is something
I can't even fathom,</i>

<i>it's like it gives me
so much joy</i>

<i>to know that they support me
and that I'm not alone.</i>

I'm different now than I was,
say even a week ago,

before this investigation began,

<i>because this taught me
more about humility,</i>

not just for myself,

but how we view others
and how others view us.

<i>I know everybody
wants that answer.</i>

<i>Who done it?</i>

<i>We will never know for sure</i>

<i>who killed Abby
and Andrew Borden.</i>

<i>If Lizzie committed
those murders,</i>

<i>or if the dark energy conjured
from the family curse made her do it.</i>

<i>Anvelo is the entity of
many faces and many names.</i>

It's what we give it,
what we put into it.

<i>I believe Anvelo
was this dark guardian</i>

<i>of the Borden murder house.</i>

<i>And I believe it was there
for a time,</i>

<i>but I think it was forced out.</i>

<i>The house felt different,
like a weight had been lifted.</i>

<i>We brought peace, not only
to the Borden family in a certain way,</i>

but also we brought peace
to many other spirits

that have come through
that house, or still remain.

<i>What matters really, is
that they find peace in the afterlife.</i>

<i>So with that,
I'm extremely grateful.</i>

<i>There's one last thing
we have to do,</i>

<i>to pay honor to Lizzie, at the
home where she finally passed away.</i>

<i>Maplecroft.</i>

<i>After Lizzie was
acquitted for the murders,</i>

<i>she and her sister, Emma,
left the family home,</i>

<i>and moved just over a mile away,</i>

<i>where Lizzie spent
the rest of her days.</i>

<i>Lizzy died in 1927 at age 66,</i>

<i>and days later,
Emma died in New Hampshire.</i>

<i>And as we enter the home,</i>

<i>we can already feel the light after
the dark seance the night before.</i>

<i>Connecting with Elizabeth,</i>

she's waiting at the stairs
to lead us upstairs.

She's got a little bit
of an edge to her,

but she still is grateful
that we're here.

When I first came to Maplecroft,

this is where I connected
with her the first time.

And I picture a woman
looking out the window,

people mocking her
on the streets.

You know like, "You did it,
you did it," and her crying.

There is a lot of sadness
here, but a lot of joy as well.

This was her sanctuary. This
is where she threw parties,

and this is where
she kind of lived her life.

And she became the person
she wanted to be.

<i>It's like after the murders,</i>

<i>the whole city
just turned against her.</i>

<i>It was a big thing for kids
to play pranks on her,</i>

<i>throw rocks at the window.</i>

It was a thing for the kids
to actually go up to this door,

<i>knock on the door and run away.</i>

<i>So she'd come and open the
door and no one would be there.</i>

<i>To be alive during
that time, to hear these things,</i>

even though
you've been acquitted,

you believe yourself
to be innocent of this crime.

It's interesting,
she took a stand.

She could have run.
She could have gone anywhere.

She had the money.

<i>But this was her home, and
she just moved blocks away,</i>

<i>resettled in the place she
knew as home, and owned it.</i>

<i>And that's...
you gotta give her that.</i>

If anything lends to the idea
that she was innocent,

or at least believed herself
to be innocent of this crime,

why would you run,
if you feel you're innocent?

When I first
communicated with her,

she mentioned the pears,
and there was a pear tree

in the backyard of
the Second Street home.

And we're gonna offer
a pear to Elizabeth.

We also have some old school,

dark chocolates for her as well.

And we're gonna leave it at the
spot where she, where she passed.

So this part of the house here

was where Elizabeth
lived later in life.

And when I see her,
I see her in this room.

This is her sanctuary.

This is the area
where she was sleeping

when she passed peacefully.

<i>Did she ever find
happiness in her life?</i>

<i>In my thoughts,
I believe that she did.</i>

<i>She was able to express
herself through music.</i>

<i>She loved music,
she loved animals,</i>

<i>and she took what came
into her life,</i>

<i>the money that came
from the deaths in her family,</i>

and actually gave a lot
of money to help animals,

and that's something that,
when I came into this house,

I learned about
a different cousin.

Elizabeth,
I just want to thank you

for allowing us into your story.

And I hope that we did
justice for you in doing so.

I hope that with
what we were able to do,

we can bring some peace
to you and your family,

and you can all finally get
the rest that you deserve.

Keep hearing whispering,
like, "Thank you, thank you."

You know,
we did something last night

at the other house that
I'd like to wrap up with here.

And it's just a quick prayer.

Lord, we just ask that you
surround this house in healing,

and a thorny hedge
of protection,

to keep it safe and the
souls that reside here safe.

<i>Please open the gateways,
bring forth the light,</i>

<i>bring forth family members
in peace and forgiveness,</i>

<i>so that any spirits that are
lost may find their way home.</i>

<i>We beg of you to give peace
to the Borden family,</i>

<i>their ancestors and to lift
the curse of the Borden family.</i>
