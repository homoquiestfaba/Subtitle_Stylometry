Three, two, one.

We live in amazing times...

That's what I'm talking about!

...Uncertain times,

Times that make us
scratch our heads

And wonder
what in the hell is that?

Join me on a search
for answers,

Answers that require puppets,

Tuba players,
unexpected discoveries,

And a little help...

Oh!
Whoo!

...From my old buddy chuck.
Nope.

Together,
we're going to prove

That every single thing
in our crazy

And unpredictable world
is connected.

Genius.

I'm mike rowe...

It's alive!

...And this is "six degrees."

Welcome to another
15-hour day of organized chaos

Here on the set of
"six degrees."

This promises to be a most
interesting endeavor today.

How you doing, chuck?

Is the tuba necessary?

The tuba is critical
to what's about to happen.

Big night for chuck
last night.

He was full-on convention mode,
chuck,

And he's paying
the price today.

You gonna make it?

Eventually, yeah.

You will be assuming
the identity

Of at least six characters,

So we're going to need
your "a" game.

Okay.

This might help, though,
with the hangover.

What is it?

This is
an ancient mousetrap,

And it's guaranteed to cure
what ails you.

You trust me?

Not really.

Well, you should,
because this is how

A mousetrap
can cure your hangover.

Good luck.

Oh.

As always, we'll be taking
the scenic route to history,

Traversing switchbacks,
silver peaks and canyons,

And a few overlooked historical
figures along the way,

Figures that will help us
prove unequivocally

How a mouse trap
can cure your hangover.

Our story starts here somewhere
in the middle of maine,

1854-ish with this kid,
hiram maxim.

He's 14 years old,
and he works as an apprentice

In this carriage
manufacturing facility.

But at the moment,
hiram is not concerned

With the manufacturing
of carriages.

He is vexed by a far
more troubling problem --

The presence of mice.

Mice are everywhere.

They scamper, they run,
they chew at his boots,

Making him absolutely crazy.
Hiram's had enough.

So he's spending his lunch hour
today on a mission,

A mission to mass murder
all the mice in maine.

In other words, the kid's trying
to build a better mousetrap.

This curious kid
often went hunting,

Bringing with him his trusty gun

And the immutable laws
of physics.

When the gun fires,
an explosion in the shell

Propels the bullet forward with
a significant amount of force.

But the force of the bullet
moving forward

Is equal to the force
of the gun moving backwards.

This lesson has been learned

By anyone
who has ever fired a weapon.

A painful lesson made possible

By the one
and only sir isaac newton.

I refer, of course,
to newton's laws of motion,

Specifically the third law
that says every action

Has an equal
and opposite reaction.

That's the lesson
that young hiram learned

When his gun knocked
him on his butt.

Now he's applying
that lesson to the task at hand,

Designing a better mousetrap.

Here's the essential problem.

The state-of-the-art mousetraps
of the day

Worked pretty much
like this one.

You'd set it and put some bait
on a hook

And the mouse would come in
and take the bait

And it would close,

Thereby trapping a single mouse
inside this cage.

Basically, you were one
and done.

That's not what hiram wants.

He wants to murder as many mice
as he possibly can,

And he's going to do it

With a little help

From newton's third law.

Just like a bullet, hiram's
mousetrap creates a recoil.

The mouse,
lured in by the cheese,

Falls onto the floor,

Which triggers a reaction,
a recoil that closes the door,

Resetting the trap
for its next victim.

In other words,
a repeating mouse trap.

Does he pull it off?
Yeah.

Does he catch a lot of mice?
Yep.

Does he patent it?

Does he make a fortune
by mass-producing it?

No. Hiram maxim leaves
a lot on the table

In the early part of his career,
literally.

If you look at
some of what he invented

Over the years,
it's kind of mind-blowing.

This is a lamp
for a locomotive.

This is an early curling iron.

This is reportedly
a better cup of coffee.

Mm!

Horrible miss on that one.

This is a pipe of peace.

It's basically an inhaler

To help with the bronchitis
that he suffered from.

This is a a gas engine,
one of the first of its kind.

He also invented
the automatic sprinkling system.

This is pure genius.

This technology is in buildings
all around the world today.

It puts the water
only where the fire is.

Right. He patents it.
Does he make any money?

No.
He lets the patent expire

And then other people
come in and make a fortune.

Here's another heartbreaker,
the light bulb.

According to maxim, it was he
who invented this, not edison.

He got ripped off in a patent
case that went to court.

And long story short,
he was shafted.

The story of the shafting starts
with a bottle of milk.

At least william sawyer said
it was milk,

But william sawyer may have been
filling his milk bottles

With something else.

According to his employer,
william sawyer was, quote,

"an expert electrician,
but also a great drunkard.

I made up my mind that
we had better get rid of him."

Well, william sawyer's employer
was hiram maxim.

Maxim fired sawyer,
but not before he made off

With something valuable --

The design for an electric lamp
which saw your patented in 1878.

Enter thomas edison.

If edison was good at inventing,
he was great at patent law.

And edison argued
that sawyer's patent

Wasn't novel enough to be valid

And also was fraudulently
and illegally procured.

After a protracted legal battle,
edison gets the patent revoked

And edison knows
when that happens,

The rights won't revert back

To hiram maxim
or to maxim's company.

Instead, they default
to another patent application

Edison had filed.

So edison becomes the accepted
inventor of the light bulb,

Leaving hiram maxim s.O.L. --

So out of lights.

But he never gives up.

He never stops tinkering.
He never stops drawing.

A few years later,
he's back at it again.

This is a helicopter,

The first design,
except for maybe da vinci,

But he's ready to
bring it to market.

He's got it done.

He just -- he just doesn't
put the ball through the hoop.

He's full of good ideas,
but he's not really executing.

And it really is enough
to make you wonder

If hiram maxim is ever going to
do anything to make a killing.

I'll give you a hint.

He does.

1881 -- it was an incredible
time for inventors,

The phonograph, jeans,
the cash register,

The light bulb, and more
had all just been released.

All of these would have
significant impacts on society,

But none inspired hiram
quite as much as the tidbit

He received
while walking around.

If you want to make
your fortune,

Invent something to help
these europeans

Kill each other
more quickly.

In other words,
screw your passion project.

The real money
is in weapons of death.

â™ª â™ª

September 27, 1918,

Neuse-argonne, France.

Behind me, 1.3 million americans

Are slowly advancing
through the forest.

Doughboys,
we called them back then.

The good news is there are only
a couple hundred thousand

Germans over the hill.

The americans
have the advantage,

But for the fact

That the germans have
in their possession a weapon

Unlike anything these kids
have ever seen,

A weapon they're not
going to like.

â™ª â™ª

Introducing the maxim
machine gun,

A weapon unlike any other.

Hiram maxim didn't create
the machine gun,

He created the first
fully <i>automatic</i> machine gun.

â™ª â™ª

Like his old mousetrap
that could catch multiple mice,

Every time this thing fires off
a round,

A new one
is automatically chambered.

The result -- a complete
and total game changer.

An internal component called
the breech block

Is pushed back
by the gun's recoil,

And the recoil ejects
the spent cartridge,

Making way for the next bullet,

Much like maxim's mouse trap
made way for the next mouse.

But on balance,

Maxim's gun was slightly
more deadly than his mousetrap.

It could fire
600 rounds per minute.

There's the man himself,
hiram maxim,

Crouched behind
what <i>the new york times</i>

Would call "peace producing
and peace retaining terrors."

The idea was that
such a powerful weapon

Would push nations
to avoid conflict.

Yeah, didn't really
work out that way.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

See what I mean?
Not good.

Hiram maxim's little invention

Just wiped out
most of this squad

In less than three seconds.

This poor guy doesn't know
what to make of the situation.

One minute he's walking
through the woods,

The next minute
all his buddies are dead.

He doesn't know where
the shooting is coming from.

He's in an obvious state
of shell shock,

Has no idea what he's going to
do with that bayonet

On the end of his weapon.

Meanwhile, the carnage
is unspeakable.

This is a 30-caliber weapon.

We're talking about firing
250 rounds every 30 seconds.

This guy's been hit half
a dozen times.

Of course, in 1918,

There wouldn't have been much
left of him.

We don't have that kind
of budget

In the recreation department.

During the reenactments,
we use blanks because,

Well, you know,
but out here on the gun range,

The maxim gun is real,
the ammo is live,

And the watermelons
and water coolers are doomed.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª â™ª

You just dumped
200 rounds.

Geez.

The situation is grim.

The carnage is unspeakable,

And the question is obvious.

How are the americans
going to fight back

Against a weapon like that?

I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking,

"mike, what is a tuba player
doing in this episode?"

Well, several things.
First of all,

"taps" sounds great on a tuba,
you have to admit.

Secondly, there's been
a lot of death in this episode.

But thirdly,
and most importantly,

After the invention
of the maxim gun,

A new kind of tuba
would come on the scene.

A tuba that would change
the course of the war.

â™ª â™ª

With machine guns,
the new normal in world war I

Armies had a new problem,

How to detect the source
of all that gunfire.

With casualties mounting,

The solution would need to be
a feat of human engineering.

And so we got the war tuba.

In no time, these cumbersome
amplifiers caught on.

British, japanese and american
forces used war tubas

To track the source
of enemy gunfire in aircraft.

This process is called sound
ranging, and it wasn't perfect.

Searching for sound through
the air was easily affected

By the elements --
dust, rain, wind, war,

Hails of bullets.

But when americans pointed the
war tubas down to the ground,

They realized they might be able
to measure

The reflections of sound

Bouncing off layers of rock
underneath the battleground

To where the germans' guns
were located.

The american responsible for
this was j. Clarence karcher.

When karcher gets back
to the states,

The war tubas
are still on his mind.

If he can locate artillery by
tracing the sound to its origin,

What else might he be able
to locate

By listening to sound waves?

That was, as they say,
the million-dollar question.

During the war,
karcher was listening

For the sound of gunfire

As it reflected off
various objects underground.

But what if karcher already knew

Where that sound
was coming from?

If he knew that,
could he then determine

The location of the objects
in the ground

That were reflecting
the sound waves back to him?

If so, could he then

Determine an object's mass
based on the speed

That the sound waves traveled?

Karcher thought
the answer to those questions

Were yes and yes,

Thanks to a revolutionary
instrument that he designed,

An instrument that could read
seismic reflection,

An instrument that he would
famously call...

The karchegraph.
No.

The karchometer.
No.

The karchenator.
No.

I guess I'll call it
the reflection seismograph.

We have a winner.

Now let's see if it works.

Karcher's reflection seismograph
can locate

Just about anything underground.

Question is,
what's he looking for today?

Jimmy hoffa?
Not yet missing.

The lost city of atlantis?

No such place.

No, karcher's looking for
buried treasure,

Specifically black gold,
texas tea,

Or if you prefer,
oklahoma ovaltine,

Because oklahoma is where he
began his famous search for oil.

Karcher's technology
proved to be an effective,

Noninvasive way to discover
oil deposits underground...

If you consider dynamite
to be noninvasive.

Karcher will need to create
a massive sound wave,

A sound wave powerful enough
to travel into the earth's crust

To find the oil buried below,

A sound wave equivalent
to a million copies

Of "war and peace"
hitting the ground

All at the same time.

In three, two, one.

Suffice it to say,
the oil boom in oklahoma

Started with a bang.

Karcher did it.

He actually found oil,

And he'll go on to commercialize

His ingenious method
of oil exploration.

Soon, seismic reflection
will be used to discover

The majority
of the world's oil deposits,

Making him a whole lot of money,

Money he'd use to build
a company,

A company he would call...
Karcherland.

No.

Karcherworld.
No.

Karcher's emporium of awesome
sound wave solutions.

No.

I guess I'll just call it

Geophysical services inc.

Or gsi for short.
Ring any bells?

Well, over the years,

Geophysical services inc.
Evolved

And started producing
electronic instruments

For the military.

That led gsi out of the oil
fields and into electronics.

And after world war ii,
karcher's little oil company

Will grow to an enormous
electronics company,

A company called
texas instruments,

Which will, among other things,

Be instrumental in curing
your next hangover.

I'm pretty sure
we can fit "karcher"

In between "texas"
and "instruments."

â™ª â™ª

Back in 1954,

When computers were
the size of a room,

Texas instruments
released the transistor radio,

Which quickly became

The best-selling electronics
device of its time.

More importantly, this was proof
that electronics

Could fit
in the palm of your hand.

This simple radio
was made possible

By the invention of the
transistor by william shockley.

More on him later.

The transistor was smaller,
cooler, more durable,

And ran on less energy than
its vacuum-tube predecessor.

But it still had
one major problem.

It could only do one thing.

If you wanted to do 10 things,
you needed 10 transistors.

If you wanted to do
a thousand things,

Well, you needed
a really big building.

Engineers at the time
were able to design

Much more complex systems
than the transistor radio,

But without more
complex circuitry,

They were impossible to realize.

This problem is known
as the tyranny of numbers.

And in the summer of 1958,

Electronics companies
around the world

Are in a mad dash
to solve this problem,

Which brings us here to dallas,
texas,

Where the competition might not
seem so heated at the moment.

That's because
it's summer vacation

At the headquarters
of texas instruments.

Unfortunately, for new employee
jack kilby,

He doesn't have
any vacation time accrued.

Fortunately for the rest
of the world,

He has the office
all to himself.

And so for the next two weeks,
jack kilby gets busy.

He integrates the circuitry
of individual transistors

Onto a single chip
using components

Made with an element
called germanium,

Which acts as a semiconductor.

It is a revolutionary idea,

An idea that will eventually
win him a nobel prize.

Jack's integrated circuit,

Otherwise
known as the microchip,

Is an idea will change
the world.

Today, we are discovering
the surprising way

That a mouse trap
will cure your hangover.

We started with the invention
of an automated mouse trap,

Which led to the first
fully automatic machine gun,

Which created the need for
something called a war tuba.

That tuba technology paved
the way for seismic reflection,

Which was used to find oil.

That oil spawned a tech company

That turned into
texas instruments,

Who had the good sense
to hire a guy named jack kilby,

Who went on to harness
the power of germanium

And reinvent the world
as we know it,

With a little miracle
called the microchip.

To sum up, a brilliant guy
in texas

Solved the tyranny of numbers

By single-handedly creating
the integrated circuit

And changing the world forever.

So why am I here, 1,700 miles
from dallas,

Strolling through a valley
that doesn't exist?

Because sometimes life
is just that weird.

â™ª â™ª

Can I get some more?

Thanks, hon.

Do we need to come up
with a snappy name?

â™ª â™ª

Well, I mean, you know,
there's eight of us,

So I was thinking
the frisky eight.

No? Okay, okay, okay.
All right, I get it, I get it.

The infinite eight, right?

Imagine a sideways 8
infinity symbol

Next to a regular eight.

It'd look good on
the stationery.

Ladies and gentlemen,
robert noyce.

Like jack kilby, noyce is
a legend in the tech industry.

At least he's gonna be.
Today he's just a traitor.

He and seven of his friends,
fellow scientists and engineers,

Some of the most brilliant minds
in the world,

Have just decided to leave their
dream jobs at shockley labs.

Noyce figures the moment
is worth commemorating.

okay, ante up.

I need a buck from each of you.

First eight dollars
for the company.

Sign them,
put them in the center.

These guys, they're
celebrating their freedom

By putting their money
where their mouth is.

It's not just
a symbolic gesture, though.

This is an actual buy-in,
a buy-in between eight men

Who are willing
to risk everything.

Eight guys who figure they can
build a better mousetrap.

Is gordon the only guy
who brought a pen?

This company's off
to a great start.

These guys are sick and tired
of working for william shockley.

You remember shockley,

The engineer who invented
the transistor,

Made this thing possible.

The man all of these engineers
dreamed of one day becoming.

Now they work for him, and
they've come to the conclusion

That he's a tyrant.

Guys, I'm missing one.

There's only seven here
who didn't put in?

Who didn't put in?

Noyce and his friends,

They decide to do
the unthinkable.

They leave shockley labs.

This is their declaration
of independence.

I'm sorry, guys. It was me.
I'm sorry. It was me.

Can I borrow a dollar?

â™ª â™ª

They will forever be known
as the traitorous eight.

So robert noyce and the rest
of the traitorous eight

Break away
from william shockley

And start a company
of their own.

They call it
fairchild semiconductor.

This company will not
only change the world,

It'll completely
revolutionize office culture,

No assigned parking spaces,

No oversized offices
to fight over,

No fancy titles,
and most of all, no ties.

Now, not wearing a tie
to work in 1957,

That'd be like
going to work today naked

Wrapped in bubble pack.
It simply wasn't done.

But these guys, they didn't
care about appearances.

What they cared about
was ideas.

Like hiram maxim,

They just wanted to build
a better mousetrap.

Noyce was very serious
about being casual.

At the risk of sounding clichÃ©,
he really was one of those guys

Who believed there truly
were no stupid questions.

Does it have to
be germanium?

Like that.

Not a stupid question
at all.

As I'm sure you realize,

Germanium is not the only
element on the periodic table

That functions
as a semiconductor.

Question is,
what would they use?

We did it, boys. Here it is,
the silicon microchip.

Where did it go?

oh, it's right there!

Anyway, that's why nobody goes
to work today

In germanium valley.

But why did they pick this area
around palo alto?

Well, for one,
it's kind of pretty.

And two, there was
an interesting new idea

Happening at a school
called stanford university.

Back in 1966,

Stanford hired
some very interesting people

To teach some
very interesting courses.

Say hello to doug engelbart.

Doug runs the augmented
human intellect research center

For the stanford research
institute.

And right now,
he's working on a plan

To help local business people
reach their potential

With a little help
from a chemical compound

Called lysergic
acid diethylamide, or lsd.

Doug engelbart is all about

Elevating man's
collective consciousness.

This, in his opinion,
can be best achieved with lsd.

Now, why should anybody
take his word for it?

Well, two years from now,
in 1968,

Doug engelbart will deliver
the mother of all demos

To a gobsmacked audience of
2,000 people in san francisco

Who must have thought
that they, too,

Were on some kind of a trip,
because in that demo,

Engelbart introduces
the groundwork for windows,

Graphic user interface,
hypertext links,

Video conferencing,
and the mouse,

Which he himself created.

Right now, he's squirting lsd
into his eyes.

Want to have a look
inside his brain?

I know I do.

Oh, yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

Doug engelbart's brain
is a great place to understand

And demonstrate the effects
of lsd

Because doug engelbart
has dropped a lot of acid.

His brain, like yours,

Is divided up
into a series of sections.

Each one functions more or less
like its own separate computer.

Now, normally,
there's a governor over top

Of all of those sections --
that's called the ego.

What happens with lsd is that
the ego becomes compromised,

Allowing the individual parts
of your brain

To communicate with each other

In ways
they otherwise would not.

This opens up all sorts
of possibilities.

It also does some very strange
things to inanimate objects

And light and sound and space
and time and so forth.

But we here at "six degrees"
do not in any way condone

The illegal use of drugs.

We're not suggesting that you
should squirt lsd into your eye

Or your nose
or your ear or your mouth

Or any other hole in your body.

That's not what we're saying.

We're simply saying
that once upon a time,

This was perfectly legal
and some very smart people

Thought it was more
than a way to escape reality.

They thought it was a way
to solve problems.

Anyway, after one of
doug engelbart's

Magic carpet rides,

He went home and assembled
the mother of all demos.

We're going to try our best
to show you rather than tell you

About this program.

A very central part of what we
have developed technologically

Is what does come
through this display to us.

To copy a word, hit that word
and copy after it, so...

After there, I might copy
from that,

And this point to that point,
and it will copy it.

If you own a personal computer,

You have most definitely
been influenced

By the life and work of
doug engelbart.

And if you've ever tried lsd,

Well, you're in the company of
some pretty interesting people,

People like steve jobs.

Taking lsd was one of the most
profound experiences of my life.

And this guy.
Oh, me? I've never done drugs.

Different strokes
for different folks.

Let's have some fun
with puppets.

You know, this would be a great
place to shoot a commercial.

â™ª â™ª

Say hi to ken kesey.
Ken's stanford graduate.

He was first introduced to lsd

By the c.I.A.
At the veterans hospital.

Talk about a rough blind date.

Ken used that experience
to write a book

Called "one flew
over the cuckoo's nest."

Jack nicholson and danny devito
starred in a movie about it,

A movie which won
every major academy award.

And look at this -- kesey
brought his friend along,

Tom wolfe, who's also writing
a book

About kesey's antics
with this motley crew,

The merry pranksters.

In 1966,

Ken kesey and his cohorts,
the merry pranksters,

Held an event in the bay area
called the trips festival.

10,000 young minds
came together to dance

To live music and drink
lsd-laced punch,

And the message kept spreading.

Kesey introduced musicians
to lsd, like the grateful dead.

Their hours-long psychedelic
performances

Of kesey's acid-test parties
define the music of the day.

Soon, the beatles got
a hold of acid,

Writing one of their most
popular albums,

"sgt. Pepper's lonely
hearts club band."

And who could ever forget
jimi hendrix?

He took some lsd one day

And basically reinvented
what a guitar should sound like.

More and more people
were turning on,

Tuning in and dropping out,

Changing the collective mind
of society,

Which is exactly what
doug engelbart envisioned

When he introduced lsd
to his team back at stanford.

Now, let's take a quick
digression to talk about

Where such a magical mystery
serum actually came from.

I'll give you a hint.

It's a land of chocolate,
watchmaking,

And intricate little knives
full of mostly useless gadgetry.

â™ª â™ª

It's April 16, 1943.
World war ii is raging,

But here in basel, switzerland,

Things are relatively peaceful,

The way they always are
in basel, switzerland.

This is albert hoffmann.
He's a chemist.

Today he's trying
to create a drug

That'll stimulate respiratory
and circulatory systems

In humans.

To achieve this,
he's combining lysergic acid

With various
other organic molecules.

During one of his trials,

Albert accidentally
gets some on his skin.

Hoffmann experiences
a feeling of euphoria.

Hold on.

Light seems to emit sound.

The objects in his lab
appear to be breathing.

Hoffmann decides

He rather enjoys this feeling.

A few days later,
he takes a little more.

Then he takes a little more
after that.

Then he takes a lot.

Rookie mistake.

Hey, hoffmann, man.
Down here.

You gotta get home
right now.

Your neighbor,
she's a witch, man.

She's gonna burn
your house down!

Multiple sources have confirmed

That albert hoffmann
was indeed convinced

That his kindly old neighbor
had turned into a witch

And was out to get him.

He needed to get home, stat.

What's your name?

â™ª â™ª

But this is wartime switzerland,

And everybody
has given up their cars,

So albert has to ride
his bike home,

Which is why April 19
is national bicycle day.

And what a bike ride it was.

Come on, albert.
Let's go stop the witch!

â™ª â™ª

Okay, okay.

It was a miracle that
albert hoffmann

Ever made it home.
Come on, albert.

And a few hours later,
when the lsd finally wore off,

Albert hoffmann realized
he was really on to something...

All the colors now.

Or <i>on</i> something,
at the very least.

Anyway, that's how lsd was
discovered in switzerland

At a lab, on a bike...
Come on, albert.

...And with some talking mice.

All the colors, man.

All the colors.

Once again, here's chuck

Helping us thank the sponsor.

Chuck-bo.
What's up?

Chuck-bo is what you call
an automobile enthusiast.

I like my cars loud.

I like the smell of high octane
in the morning.

Which means he's not a big fan
of the electric variety.

I don't want to plug
in my car.

No, but if he did,
he might be surprised to know

That the electricity that powers
his car flows through wires

And a grid and eventually
goes to a turbine

That spins
courtesy of natural gas.

You're telling me an electric
car is actually fueled

And powered by natural gas?

In many cases. Yeah.

Well, in that case,
I'll take one,

And it's got to come in
either ammo or camo.

Ammo's not a color.
Yes, it is.

And on the hood
has got to be a decal,

Preferably
a bird of prey.

I'll make some calls.

Right on.

If you're just joining us.
Man, you missed a lot.

It started
with a better mousetrap,

A better gun, a better tuba,

The traitorous eight,

And a scientist
who invented lsd.

Time now to land the plane.

All the colors.

It would be convenient to say
that lsd was responsible

For driving
the counterculture revolution

That defined the 1960s.

Some people think it did.
Many, in fact.

Drugs were certainly in many
places that defined that decade.

Can you imagine the summer
of love

Without a happy, heaping helping
of hallucinogens?

Fact is, drugs brought a lot of
like-minded people together,

People who began
to question societal norms,

Demand civil rights
and equal justice for everybody.

The same people who suggested
that maybe the war in vietnam

Might be something worth ending.

By the mid-'60s,

People were opposing the war
on moral grounds.

On October 21, 1967,

100,000 people
showed up in washington

To protest the war in vietnam.

By 1973, the vietnam war
was an unmitigated disaster

And there was only one man
with the courage

And the guts to get us out.

Richard milhous nixon.

True -- he wasn't perfect.

There were stories in the press
about his purported affection

For multiple martinis,

His alleged taste for the dog
biscuits he kept on his desk,

And, of course,
the legendary paranoia

That led him to tape every
conversation in the oval office.

But on January 23, 1973,

Richard nixon
was the man for the job.

At 3:00 a.M.
Eastern standard time,

Nixon was waiting for a phone
call from henry kissinger.

Sign it!

With that phone call,

Nixon saved
thousands of american lives.

Yes, he's remembered today for
that whole watergate situation

And for being the first sitting
president to resign from office

And for becoming
the butt of countless jokes

And mean-spirited aspersions.

But eating dog biscuits?
Come on.

Who among us hasn't been drawn
to the tasty treats

Typically reserved
for man's best friend?

No dog lover
is beyond such redemption.

Even the man who got us
out of vietnam.

That's right.

That was me, baby.

When the north vietnamese
agreed to a cease-fire,

We packed up and left

And everybody lived
happily ever after. Right?

Not if you were in
the south vietnamese army.

After the u.S. Withdrew,

Communist north vietnam
took over south vietnam,

And if you were
a south vietnamese officer,

In those days,
things look pretty bleak.

And if you were
of chinese descent,

You needed to find a boat fast.

With south vietnam on the brink
of an economic crisis

After the war,

Low consumer prices offered
by the chinese

Posed a real threat
to the hanoi government.

Vietnamese soldiers were sent
to raid chinese homes and shops,

Forcing the chinese to flee
with nothing to their name.

Enter david tran.

David's a refugee
and a former south vietnamese

Of chinese descent.

It's 1980, and david is feeling
pretty rad right now.

He just started a small business
out of his apartment

Making hot sauce,
and people are eating it up.

Soon he'll have enough saved
for a van,

And eventually a proper space
to mass-produce this hot sauce.

He'll name his company
after the freighter

That took him from vietnam
to the united states.

And eventually huey fong foods
will come out with a new flavor,

Sriracha,
a name synonymous with hot sauce

That made over $80 million
last year alone.

Oh, yeah, 1980, david tran is
feeling pretty rad indeed.

He's the epitome
of the american dream,

A refugee escaping communism,
coming to this country on a boat

With nothing in his pockets
but a recipe for hot sauce.

Here's to you, david tran,
a poster child for capitalism

And the american dream.

Of course, none of david tran's
accomplishments

Would have been possible
if he hadn't made it to america

After the united states
departed vietnam,

A departure made possible
by a counterculture revolution,

A revolution fueled
by free love, world peace,

And all the acid you could drop,

A drug that changed computers
forever

After two geniuses
independently invented

The microchip.

Thanks to another genius

Who used seismic technology
to find gunfire.

Machine gunfire made possible
by yet another genius

Who never got over
his burning desire

To build a better mousetrap,

Which is really just
a long way of saying

That is how a mousetrap can help
you cure your hangover,

Assuming, of course,
you have the secret ingredient.

I refer to sriracha
hot chili sauce.

Thank you, david tran.

Just the thing to spice up
a bloody mary

And change
your whole world view.

You know what I'm talking about?
sock it to me.

â™ª â™ª

Spicy is good. Alex, play
something appropriate.

I love it
when a plan comes together.

Not bad.

You couldn't have given me this
this morning?

There were stories in the press

About his purported affection
for multiple martinis.

The press loved to write
about his sweaty --

Owha-ha-ha!

I see what you did there.

I'll tell you what, it's not
a bad martini, very dry.

I was halfway to --
to downing the whole thing...

...When suddenly
I felt the fire

In the back of my throat,

And I said, "jesus,
lord have mercy.

They put real vodka
in this drink."
