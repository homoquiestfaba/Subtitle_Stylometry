AGRA 1887

BRITAIN HAS FORMALLY RULED
INDIA FOR TWENTY-NINE YEARS

Idiot!

Name?

Jabi.

Hey, you're wanted at
the governor's office.

Ah, Mr Karim.

I wanted to speak to you
about the carpets

we sent to the British Exhibition.

There is a problem, sir?
No, no.

The carpets went down very well.

In fact, the Governor General

has received a letter
from the Royal Household

thanking him personally.

It's all been such a success,

he has decided to present the Queen

with a mohar as part of the Jubilee.

A mohar, sir?

A mohar. Apparently some
sort of ceremonial coin.

I've been asked to find
someone tall to present it.

You're the tallest person here.

When will she be arriving, sir?

Not in Agra, in England!

You will travel to England.

And present the mohar
as an official function.

Like an equerry.

On a horse?

I don't think
there'll be a horse.

Equerry always has a horse,
Mr Tyler, sir.

Well, maybe not like
an equerry exactly.

Morning.

Ah, morning.

This is Major Bigge,

extra Groom in Waiting
to the Royal Household Windsor

who will be in charge
of your journey.

This is Abdul.

Top hole!
And this is Mohammed,

who will also be
presenting the mohar.

He's very short.

We had to swop him
at the last moment.

The tall chap had an
accident with an elephant.

BUCKINGHAM PALACE

Good morning, Your Majesty.

At the head is the Lord Chamberlain,

then the Private Secretary,
the Deputy Private Secretary,

the Ladies in Waiting,
the Upper Servants,

the lower Upper Servants.

Then the members of the Household:

One, the head of the Bedchamber,

two, the personal head of staff,

three, the Butler in Chief,

who is in charge of
the Household Butler,

the kitchen factotum,
the Head Chef,

the head of waiting staff,
the ordinary waiting staff, Windsor,

the table maids, then you.
Any questions?

Uh-huh, who will have the mohar, sir?

I'm not exactly sure as yet.

I suspect you'll both carry it.
On a cushion.

Do we both get a cushion?

I really don't know.

The key to good service
is standing still and moving backwards.

The most important thing is
you must not look at her.

What an arsehole.

Have you any idea
how cold it is in England?

We're gonna die there.

Why did you agree to come?

The tall one fell off an elephant,
I wasn't given a choice.

Ugh, five thousand miles
to present a bloody medal

to the oppressor of the
entire Indian subcontinent.

You don't realise what a
great honour this is for us.

Have you ever tasted English food?
They eat pig's blood.

They do not eat pig's blood.

I'm telling you, they put
pig's blood in the sausages,

and brains of sheep.

Ugh.

The place is completely barbaric.

Give us some money.

Please, sir?

Civilisation!

Please, sir, give us a farthing.

Give us a farthing, sir.

Arms.

<i>Arms.</i>

We copied them from some drawings

in the British Museum.

Splendid!

You do know
the sash is not traditional, sir?

The Indian drawings didn't look very...
Indian

so we made some innovations.

The important thing is to look...
authentic.

Looks jolly good to me.

<i>Jubilee celebrations:
9:00, breakfast in London,</i>

<i>Quarter to ten,
changing of the guard.</i>

11:00, meeting with the
Swedish Ambassador.

12:00, luncheon with Oscar II,
King of Sweden and Norway,

<i>the Norwegian Ambassador,</i>

<i>the Chief Undersecretary of State
for the southern Norwegian provinces,</i>

<i>the Junior Undersecretary
of State for the</i>

northern Norwegian provinces.

2:00, ceremonial drive down the Mall.

Half past two,

tea party at Hyde Park
for 30,000 children.

<i>Half past four,</i>

<i>household departs on the
royal train to Windsor.</i>

<i>Half past six,
dinner in the Great Hall.</i>

Come on, then,
chop chop!

<i>And the ceremonial presentation
of a mohar.</i>

The Hindoos, sir!

But they're completely different sizes.

There was an incident, sir,
with an elephant.

Hmm.

The Queen arrives.

Fanfares.

Ceremonial entrance.

The Royal Entourage
make their way to the table,

to be seated thus.

Her Majesty.

Sir Henry Ponsonby,
Private Secretary,

the Secretary of State for India,

the Emperor of Russia,
Dr Reid, Lady Churchill,

Miss Phipps, etcetera,
etcetera. Grace.

Soup: potage Saint Germain
with purÃ©e de madeleines.

Fish course: morue Ã  huÃ®tres.

Fanfare. EntrÃ©e:

quenelle with Regency sauce,
etcetera, etcetera.

Dessert: pain d'Ã©pinards,
tartelettes Ã  la Suisse,

profiteroles.
Always profiteroles.

You will come from the
northwest service entrance.

Process together.

And you will stand here.

No.

A little bit.

That's it.

Presenting the tray thus.

Tray?

I-I thought it was a cushion.

You will present the tray.

Excuse me...

Do I get a tray?

No, we've only got one tray.

Uh-huh. So, what do I do?

You'll just have to improvise.

Whatever you do, you must
not look at Her Majesty.

You will bow again.
Then moving backwards,

you will turn to your left.
You will leave thus,

and you will process
down the hall

to be met by Mr Bigge

who will walk you
to the north wall

where you will stand
till the end of the meal.

Would you like me to
run through that again?

Mr Yorke, she's heading
to Paddington.

Everybody out!

You two, stairs, now.

Jesus Christ!

Where are the...
quenelles?

Oi, you two,
out of it!

She's at the station, sir!

Jesus H. Christ,
she's at the... station!

For God's sake,
just wait where you were told.

Open the doors.

<i>Quenelles!</i>

Open the doors!

Open the doors!

<i>Open the doors!</i>

She's here.

Soup.

Soup!

Soup!

Soup!

Soup!

Soup!

Ah, thank heavens.

Soup, Your Majesty.

<i>Must you take this one?</i>

I haven't finished it.

I-I'm afraid you have to be quick.

They take it off you
as soon as she's done.

One down, six to go.

The morue Ã  huÃ®tres
and then the quenelle.

Yes, sir.

The morue Ã  huÃ®tres
and then the quenelle.

This is bloody ridiculous.

Two months in a boat
and I haven't even got a tray?

I have the mohar.

Is that it?

Your Majesty?

Your Majesty?

The uh, the profiteroles.

Is that it?

The profiteroles have gone.

Gentlemen, process.
Turn. Bow. Present.

And absolutely
no eye contact whatsoever.

A gift from the Indian Empire.

A mohar, Your Majesty.

A what?

A Mughal coin, Your Majesty

in honour of your service
to the uh, subcontinent.

Have we finished?

We still have coffee, Your Majesty.

Eyes!

Good morning, Your Majesty.

<i>Breakfast with the
Royal Princes of Belgium.</i>

<i>11:00, an audience
with the Sultan of Dubai</i>

<i>where Her Majesty will be
presented with the Diamond of Ooojay.</i>

<i>Garden party where
Her Majesty will receive</i>

Oscar II, King of Sweden
and Norway, again.

And Queen Lili'uokalani.

Who on earth is she?

A monarch and
sole Queen Regnant

of the Kingdom of Hawaii,
Your Majesty.

She has composed a song for you
on the ukulele.

But we have managed to put her off.

Then you will eat
with the Prime Minister

and at 7:00, the banquet
in the state dining room.

And your movements, Your Majesty?

Nothing to speak of, Dr Reid.

Not even during the day?

We last moved on Sunday evening.

Oh, I feel the celebratory dinners
are taking their toll, Your Majesty.

Might I suggest
some Benger's Mixture?

I refuse to eat Benger's.
It's baby food.

But it is imperative, Your Majesty,

that the royal colon
receives a little roughage.

Anything else?

Uh, was Her Majesty
pleased with the mohar?

What?

The mohar, the ceremonial coin.

Uh, presented by the
two Indian servants.

I thought the tall one
was terribly handsome.

Stop!

Slight change of plan.

You must not talk
to any of the guests.

Nod or bow but please

do not interact with anybody
other than the serving staff.

I will come to you
when the Queen is seated.

And you will present
the royal pudding as requested.

Eh, excuse me, sir,

but what is it?

That is a jelly. A pudding
made from the liquor of fruit.

How do they get it so stiff?

Gelatin.
A byproduct of cow bone.

Barbarians!

There's another famine in India.

More trouble in Ireland,
I'm afraid.

Suez is a perennial nightmare.

And I'm afraid the Boers
are at it again.

Is there any <i>good</i> news,
Prime Minister?

We've decided to annex Zululand,
Your Majesty.

Whatever for?

We really have to box in
the Boers if we possibly can,

Oh, Prime Minister,
Your Majesty.

you really are terribly depressing.

Yes.

Ah, sandwiches.

Mmm.

<i>Splendid!</i>

Jelly.

Oh.

Splendid.

Jelly, Your Majesty.

I suddenly feel
a great deal better.

What the hell were you thinking?!

You said present the jelly, sir.

I didn't say kiss the feet
of the Empress of India!

I-I thought it would cheer her up.

Cheer her up?

They'll have me court-martialed!

What on earth is going on?

Her Majesty has requested

Mr Karim and Mr Baksh

be her personal footmen

for the rest of the Jubilee.

You stupid bloody idiot.

All you had to do
was give her jelly.

We could be going home by now.

Ah, gentlemen.
You can wait here by the door.

Her Majesty wants you to
stand in here by the writing desk.

Go on.

Thank you.

You may go.

Oh, thank you, uh
Your Majesty.

Don't worry.

I'm not going to eat you.

Doctor Reid,

a very

successful

movement

at 8:00

this morning.

What the hell
is going on in there?

Thank you, Mr...

Abdul.

Abdul Karim.

I am always writing.

In India, I am writing all day.
Every day.

So, in India,
you are not a servant?

No.

In India, I am writing
in my very big book.

You're writing a book?

Yes.

I'm writing every name,

who they are,
what they have done.

This is my life.

Every day, I'm writing,
from morning to night.

And this is fiction?

No. It is the very truth.

I don't understand.

If you are an author,
why are you here?

Presenting me
with the m...

with...
Mohar.

It is my humble privilege
to server Her Majesty.

I was the one
who chose your carpets.

Carpets?

Yes. The Viceroy asked Mr Tyler, sir,
but actually, it was me.

You have to have
a very good eye for the carpets.

Like...this is a very nice one

for example.

Very...very tight knots.

The art of carpets
came to India from Persia

with the great Emperor Akbar.

The skill of a carpet

is to bring all the different
kinds of threads together

and weave something
we can all stand on.

You seem to know
a great deal about it.

My family were carpet makers.

But now I write in the book.

Life is like a carpet.

We weave in
and out to make a pattern.

That is a very beautiful image.

Look.

Here is the bird of freedom

caught forever in the design.

So, in India you are a poet?

No.

In India, I make a ledger
of the prisoners.

We are all prisoners,
Mr Karim.

Apparently, he's a poet.

What the hell
are you playing at?

Stop being so friendly.

These people are the exploiters
of a quarter of all of mankind.

Do you really think
they give a hoot about us?

Huh?

Bloody well freeze to death
at this rate.

And cut all the nicey-nicey crap
and let's get the hell out of here.

Agreed?

I promise.

Goodnight.

Will you stop doing that?!

You realise

this is the third day in a row.

So, Mr Abdul...

may I ask what part
of India you're from?

I'm from Agra.

The Taj Mahal?

Have you ever been
to the Taj Mahal?

No.

Oh, it is the most marvellous building
in the entire world, Your Majesty.

The Crown of Palaces.

It was built by Shah Jahan
to remember his dead wife

who died at childbirth
during their fourteenth child.

Goodness!

He was so upset with grief,

he brought the greatest architects
from Persia, Afghanistan

to build the Taj Mahal.

It certainly sounds
a handsome building.

I'd very much like to see it.

Oh, it is beautiful, Your Majesty!

It's all white marble.

All that beauty for the dead Queen.

Mmm. How romantic.

Shah Jahan also built the Red Fort,

the Gardens of Shalimar,

the Peacock Throne.

The Peacock Throne?

It is the most beautiful
throne in all the world.

And inside the throne
was the Koh-i-Noor.

But I have the Koh-i-Noor.
I wear it as a brooch.

Do you?
Yes.

It wasn't very shiny
so Albert had it recut.

What happened
to the Peacock Throne?

They smashed it up.

How awful.

They're always smashing things up.

The British soldiers have taken
the jewels from the Taj Mahal.

British soldiers?

Oh, yes, after the Mutiny.

But, this is terrible.

What can they be talking about?

A servant and an Indian.

What on earth
does she see in him?

Well, he <i>is</i> rather handsome.

What happened to Shah Jahan?

He was overthrown by his son
and died in Agra Fort.

The wickedness of children.

They buried him in the Taj Mahal

with his wife, Mumtaz.

They also wrote an inscription:

"Here lies Shah Jahan

who left this world for the
Banquet Hall of Eternity."

The Banquet Hall of Eternity.

I rather like that idea.

You seem very well-informed.

Oh, these are famous stories of
Uttar Pradesh.

You should go there.

Oh, I can never go there.
I am forbidden.

Forbidden?

They fear I would be assassinated.

So, you have never seen an India street?

Or a stall of spices?
No.

Oh, oh, the spices.

Cumin, coriander,
garam masala.

Garam mas...
What is garam masala?

It is what you put into the sauce.

You have never tasted
Indian food?

Dal? Rogan josh?

Biryani with mango chutney?

Mango chutney?

Chutney made out of mango.

What is mango?

Mango is the Queen of Fruit.

What does it taste like?

Like a... an orange...

and a peach.

Hmm.

Sir Henry,

I would like a mango.

A mango?

Yes, I would like to taste a mango.

That's impossible, Your Majesty.
They only grow in India.

Well, I am Empress of India.
So have one sent.

TOP OF THE MOOR,
SCOTLAND

Here!

Your Majesty.

Oh.

Thank you.

How do you like your new
Scottish costumes?

They're very scratchy,
Your Majesty.

Everything in Scotland is scratchy.

Sir Henry?

When does Bertie arrive?

Tomorrow, Your Majesty.

He's on his way from...
Monte Carlo.

It's all right for her.
She's upholstered.

Oh, God, I hate Scotland!

Ah! Ye must be the Hindoos!

Very nice to meet ye.

Ye must be the Hindoos.

Ye.

Must.

Be.

The.

Hin.

Doos.

More! More! More!

More!

I wish she'd bloody well
go to bed.

<i>Hey!</i>

Good morning, Your Majesty.

The boxes, Your Majesty.

Thank you.

And the uh, the blank journal
Your Majesty requested.

You may go.

I'm perfectly capable
of working through the boxes.

Abdul is very helpful with his blotter.

Oh, but these are
parliamentary papers, Your Majesty.

I'm aware of that.

But Abdul is a servant.

He cannot assist with the boxes.

And I am the Queen of England.

I will have whatever help
I require with the boxes.

And Sir Henry,

would you get some
gloves for the Hindus?

They're suffering terribly
from the cold.

He's helping her with the boxes.

I want you to teach me Indian.

Indian?

Hindu, whatever it is you speak.

Are you sure?

Of course, I'm sure.

But why would you like to
learn Hindi, Your Majesty?

Well, I am Empress of India.

Look, I've ordered a book.

I want you to give me
private lessons.

I can't teach you Hindi,
Your Majesty.

Why ever not?

You are the Empress of India.

You should learn Urdu.

The language of the Mughals.

There are a thousand languages in India

but Urdu is the most noble.

May...
in Hindi...

you write like this.

Hmm.
but in Urdu...

you write like this.

Mairn raini hoom.

I am the Queen.

I see.

Mairn

May...

raini

ranee... runny?

hoom. hoom.

hooo.

Hoom.
Hoom.

Hmoo.
Hoom, hoom, hoom.

He's teaching her Hindu.

Is that allowed?

Ahem, I think you will find
it is Urdu.

The Muslim version.

Oh, my goodness me!

Ranee...

hoom.

That's it!

You are the Queen.

The Queen is
very wise.

Raini

kafi

akal man

You see?

Now you write it down.

Raini
Raini

kafi

She's writing in her journal

and she's speaking in Hindustani!

It's Urdu, actually.

The Muslim version.

Apani

knee

Up, up, knee?

Knee?

Knee.

Up a knee,
Apani!

Ap, ap, apani!

Yes! Yes!

Thank you, Abdul.
You are an excellent teacher.

Bertie!
Mother!

Were you spying on me?

Were you learning Urdu?

Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.

You think that's
entirely appropriate?

I am Empress of India,
what could be more appropriate?

But in front of the entire Household?

You're absolutely right.

I have no privacy here.

Sir Henry?

I would like to go with Abdul
to Glassalt Shiel.

Glassalt Shiel?

Alone.

But I've only just got here!

Oh, to be by oneself

and live a simple
rudimentary existence.

They don't understand anything.

These stupid aristocratic fools.

Toadying around,
jockeying for position.

I've had it all my life.

Ha. They couldn't bear me bringing
dear John Brown here.

I was happier here than
anywhere in the entire world.

Oh, I miss him, Abdul.

And Albert.

It's thirty years now,
and I think of him every day.

I'm so lonely.

Everyone I've really loved has died.

And I just go on and on.

Oh, Your Majesty.

It's an impossible position.

No one really knows
what it's like to be Queen.

I'm hated by millions of people
all over the world.

I have had nine children,
all vain and jealous,

and at loggerheads with each other.

And Bertie's a complete
embarrassment.

And look at me.

A fat, lame, impotent,
silly old woman.

What is the point, Abdul?

What is the point?

Service.

Service?

I think we are not here
to worry about ourselves.

We are here
for a greater purpose.

In the Koran, it says,

we are here
for the good of others.

The Koran?

Yes. I am a Hafiz.
I know the Koran by heart.

By heart. Isn't it very long?

114 Surahs

containing
6,236 verses.

And you know every word?

Many Muslim people
know the Koran.

I thought you were Hindu.

I am a Muslim, Your Majesty.

I learnt the Koran from my father.

He is my Munshi.

Munshi?

Yes, Munshi. My teacher.

Well, we would like you
to be the Queen's Munshi.

But I'm only a servant,
Your Majesty.

A servant cannot be a Munshi.

Well, you are a servant no longer.

You are my teacher.

You will teach me Urdu
and the Koran,

and anything else
you could think of.

<i>So...</i>

What the hell is a Munshi?

Well, apparently it's some sort of uh...

spiritual teacher, Your
Royal Highness.

I mean, has she completely
lost her mind?

She's the head of the Church
of England, for God's sake.

What's the Archbishop of
Canterbury going to say?

I say he's the <i>brown</i> John Brown.

Oh, my God.

Your Majesty.

Good evening, Bertie.

Mother.

What the hell are you wearing?

Dinner is served.

Lady Churchill was
absolutely scandalised.

Sitting next to a servant.

And a Hindoo to boot!

The Munshi is a Muslim scholar.

And knows the Koran
off by heart

And for your information,
is a servant no longer.

He is to be given
a staff of his own.

What do you mean, a staff?

The little fat one.

Oh, this is absurd!

Letters, invitations to supper.

You're treating him like
a member of the family.

No, I like Abdul.

Lady Churchill had better
get used to the fact.

As the Munshi is coming
on holiday with us

as a member of the Household.

You can't take a Muslim to Florence.

I can take a Muslim
wherever I like.

Goodnight, Bertie.

Munshi?

Yes.

A spiritual advisor?

You haven't an idea in your head.

You promised to get us
out of here.

And now we're going to
bloody Florence.

You don't see what
a privilege it is to see

the glories of Italy with
all these wonderful people?

You complete bloody idiot.

Do you think they're just
going to stand there

and let her promote a wog?

I did not come here
to carry your bloody cases.

What are you complaining about?

We have our own carriage.

With a bathroom.

They've made a very nice
bed for you on the floor.

Oh, I'm dying here.

I want to go home.

I'm getting sick of your
negative attitude.

Life is a big adventure.

You just need to open up
and enjoy it.

We're on holiday.

What-what on earth
could possibly go wrong?

'Do Not Pull.'

I would like to apologise
for the emergency brakes,

Your Majesty.

And I hope you did not
get injured.

Oh, Abdul, it was nothing.

It was a perfectly
understandable mistake.

I'm so glad you're with us.

What a treat to show you Florence...

What's he doing here?

Abdul came to explain
what happened earlier.

Mother, I really don't see why
I have to share your bathroom.

I shared a bed with my mother
until I became Queen.

I am 57 years old.

The Munshi's got his own bathroom.

Yes, very fine bathroom...
Yes! Yes!

Goodnight, Ma-mah!

Goodnight, Mr Bertie.

Bertie, make sure
you shut that door.

Abdul...

I have something for you.

To celebrate your
first visit to Florence.

And for becoming my Munshi.

It is a locket.

With a picture of me.

How can I ever thank you,
Your Majesty?

Keep me safe.

Forever.

Oh, Abdul.

You will love Florence.

Such wonderful views.

Isn't it glorious?

Albert loved it here.

He so admired the Medicis.

That they commissioned
the greatest artists of the day.

In order to leave something
astonishing behind.

In India also, we commissioned
great artists.

Each emperor would bring
the greatest craftsmen

to make great glories
for their Durbar Room.

Durbar Room?
Ah, yes.

Every emperor had a Durbar Room.

Full of the finest things
known to man.

Well, I am the Empress of India.

I should have a Durbar Room.

That's a wonderful idea,
Your Majesty.

But where would you put it?

Oh, the Isle of Wight, obviously.

Your Majesty,
Signor Puccini has arrived.

â™ª Deh! non cessare â™ª

â™ª deh, non cessar â™ª

â™ª Manon Lescaut â™ª

â™ª mi chiamo â™ª

Shhh.

â™ª Sussurro gentil,
deh, non cessar â™ª

â™ª deh! non cessare â™ª

â™ª deh, non cessar â™ª

Oh!

Where did you say it was from,
Mr Puccini?

From my new opera,
Your Majesty.

<i>Manon Lescaut</i>

About two lovers
who are separated

by the class divide.

But they run away together.

Oh, it sounds marvellous.

But she is imprisoned
for her love.

Oh.

But they escape.

Bravo!

But finally she dies

and he is utterly bereft.

I'm not sure we do like
the sound of it after all.

We prefer comic opera.

Do you know any
Gilbert and Sullivan?

Perhaps Your Majesty
will sing us a song?

Oh, no, no.
I couldn't possibly.

Oh, of course, of course.
Yes, Your Majesty.

Yes, Your Majesty.
No, really.

Oh, well.

Maybe just one.

From <i>Pinafore</i>, Bertie?

Do I have to?

â™ª I'm called Little Buttercup â™ª

â™ª dear Little Buttercup â™ª

â™ª Though I could never tell why â™ª

â™ª But still I'm called Buttercup â™ª

â™ª poor little Buttercup â™ª

â™ª Sweet Little Buttercup I! â™ª

â™ª I've snuff and tobaccy â™ª

â™ª and excellent jacky â™ª

â™ª Of... â™ª

â™ª La, di, di, di, di â™ª

Bellissimo!

I was taught by Mendelssohn,
you know.

To the Queen!

To the Queen!
The Queen!

To me.

<i>â™ª Di, di, di, di, di â™ª</i>

â™ª Di, di, di, di, di â™ª

â™ª La, la, la, la, la â™ª

Oh, we shouldn't have had so
much champagne.

May I?

â™ª Di, di, di, di, di â™ª

â™ª - Di, di, di, di, di
La, la, la, la, la â™ª

â™ª - La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la â™ª

â™ª - La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la â™ª

Oh, Abdul!

I haven't been as
happy as this for years.

When I first came to England,

I was terrified of you.

But you're a very kind lady.

A very unique lady to me.

And you are very, very
unique to me, Abdul.

I know that you are much
older than me.

And...

you are the Queen of England.

And the Empress of India.

I am just a humble Munshi.

But I think

you are the most special person
in my whole life.

Even more special than my wife.

Wife?

Yes.

You're married?

Of course.

Where is your wife?

In India.

Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

I didn't think it mattered.

Well, of course it matters.

It changes everything.

You must return
to India immediately.

And bring her back at once.

OSBORNE HOUSE,
ISLE OF WIGHT

<i>How is the weather
in Agra these days?</i>

Bloody hell.

He's coming!

How terribly exciting!

It's Alibaba!

Look at the size of him.

Where'd he get those medals?

What the devil is she wearing?

You can't even see her face.

She looks rather splendid!

But you cannot actually see her,
Your Majesty.

I think it's rather dignified.

Who the hell is that?

Get the bags, boy.

He's brought a serving boy.

Good God, another one!
How many has he got in there?

Ruddy sod's a bigamist.

I do hope they like
their little cottage.

Your Majesty.

I hope it's not inconvenient.

I just thought we'd
pop round for tea.

Oh.

This is my granddaughter,
Sophia, Queen of Greece,

and this is the Grand Duchess
Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,

and my daughter,
Princess Helena Augusta Viktoria

of Schleswig-Holstein-
Sonderburg-Augustenburg.

This is my wife, Mrs Karim,

and this is my mother-in-law.

Your Majesty,
Sophia, Queen of Greece,

Grand Duchess Sophie
of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,

Princess Helena Augusta Viktoria

of Schleswig-Holstein-
Sonderburg-Augustenburg,

I would like to take this opportunity

on behalf of myself,

my wife, and my wife's mother

to thank Her Majesty

for accommodating us.

We are very grateful
for her infinite kindness

and interior decoration.

The gift of hospitality
and friendship to strangers

is of very high importance
in our culture.

And so, we are honoured to repay it
in our own small way.

What is ours is yours.

Quite literally.

Thanks be to Allah.

My dear Munshi,

we're so glad to have you here,
my children.

We've missed you enormously.

I can't wait to show you
the Durbar Room.

Children?

Ponsonby, you will have
to do something about this.

My dear Munshi,
I'm so glad you're back.

It's been dreadfully dull
without you.

And I'm so glad to meet
Mrs Karim.

There is just one thing

I've been curious about
the whole afternoon.

What does she look like
behind her veil?

You must see her.

Is that allowed?

You are a lady,

and the Empress of India.

Oh!

Well, where the bloody hell
is she going now?

Your Majesty.

Oh.

You really are beautiful.

What on earth is a Durbar Room?

It's a celebration of all things
Indian, Prime Minister.

Inspired by the Mughal Emperors.

But I don't understand.

Who gave her permission
to build this in the first place?

Don't blame me.
I was in Monte Carlo.

I'm afraid she's a law
unto herself, Prime Minister.

For God's sake.
She'll be wearing a burqa next.

Prime Minister.

You are late.

I am terribly sorry, Your Majesty.

Well, let us begin.

This as you can see
is the Indian corridor.

The Durbar Room was designed
by Mr Bhai Ram Singh.

The place is crawling with them.

We have commissioned a series
of portraits of eminent Indians.

This...

Princess Gouramma.

And this, of course...

is the Munshi.

Honoured to meet you,
Mr Prime Minister, sir.

A good likeness,
don't you think?

I had asked him to take
a few pounds off.

This is my wife,
Mr Prime Minister, sir.

And that is my
mother-in-law.

At least I think that's
the right way round.

These are my servants,
Mohammed and Ahmed.

And this
is the Durbar Room.

What the hell is
going on here, Ponsonby?

The carvings are from
Uttar Pradesh.

And the carpet was woven
in a jail in Agra.

Perfect, I think,
for the tableaux.

But the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance

is the Peacock Throne.

An exact copy
of the one at Agra.

And of course, the Koh-i-Noor.

Now I really do feel
like the Empress of India.

I thought she was
supposed to be dying.

It really is a remarkable
addition to the house, Your Majesty.

We have Abdul to thank
for the whole idea.

To celebrate the
completion of the Durbar Room.

A little surprise, Your Majesty.

What is it?

A mango, Your Majesty.

One moment, Your Majesty.

Eh, it-it's... off.

Sir Henry.

This mango is off.

I'm-I'm terribly sorry,
Your Majesty.

Take one of these
whenever you see the Munshi.

I can't wait to show you
the tableau, Prime Minister.

A line has definitively been crossed.

I can't go onstage like this.

I'm absolutely sick.

Oh, but you have to.

The Prime Minister will be watching.

This is a complete and utter disaster.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

They've been waiting for this.

Who? Who have?

Ponsonby, Reid,
the whole damn lot.

Uh-huh.
Don't you see?

She's been rubbing their noses in it.
But now, it's going public.

I'm telling you, they're
not going to stand for it.

They'll rise up and
chop your bloody balls off.

Yeah, but I haven't done anything.

You stupid, bloody Uncle Tom.
You can't win on their terms.

Mrs Munshi!

Bertie.

I've never been so humiliated
in my entire life.

Actually, I'm rather enjoying it.

Beginners onstage, please.

A scene in ancient Persia.

I am the Sultan of Persia!

The King of all Kings.

Your Highness,

we bestow upon you

all the riches of the Orient.

You are now
under my power.

Bravo! Bravo!
The Munshi!

What the hell is this, Ponsonby?

Munshi mania?

I'm trying to keep
an Empire together.

Looks like they're running the place.

I want this whole sodding mess
knocked on the head.

Or you're finished.

Understood?

Oh, Sir Henry.

Tell us what exactly did the Prime
Minister said about the tableau.

Well uh, to be entirely frank,
Your Majesty

he seemed to be
a little perturbed.

Whatever for?

He must have liked the Munshi.

I think the Munshi
was the problem, Your Majesty.

Really? I thought
he was rather good.

I think he meant his position.

I think he was rather
alarmed he had such a

prominent role in the household.

Well, of course Abdul has
a prominent role in the household.

He is my Munshi.

But he's an Indian,
Your Majesty.

I am aware of that.

Given current sensitivities
in the subcontinent, Your Majesty.

The Prime Minister was concerned
that it might be

sending the wrong message.

I should have thought it was
a jolly good message.

But he's a Muslim, Your Majesty.

Precisely.

We owe them so much,
do we not?

For their role in the Mutiny,
for example.

The Mutiny, Your Majesty?

Yes, for the help
they gave us with the Hindus.

Ah, but the Mutiny was
a Muslim-led revolt, Your Majesty.

Are you sure?

Of course.

The Muslim soldiers revolted
when it was rumoured

that their rifles were
greased with pork fat.

Really?

The Grand Mufti, himself,

put out a fatwa against
you personally, Your Majesty.

And Muslim soldiers murdered
over 2,000 British personnel.

Who have you been
talking to, Mother?

Ta-da!

I have opened my heart to you.

I brought your family from India.

I promoted you in face
of considerable opposition

and disquiet from the Household.

I even turned a blind eye
when you failed to tell me

that you were married, which,
as you know, came as quite a surprise.

How could you let me
humiliate myself

in front of the entire Household?

I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty.

You said the Hindus
were behind the Mutiny.

I didn't say it was only the Hindus.

You told me categorically
the Muslims were my friends.

We are your friends, Your Ma...

Abdul, there is a fatwa against me.

It was the Muslims
who started the whole thing.

This is completely unacceptable!

Abdul, I thought you were

outstanding as the Sultan of Persia

but I'm afraid
you have to go home.

You hurt my feelings very much indeed.

Don't you see the position
you have put me in?

Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

I will miss you a very great deal.

So.

We're going home?

Goodnight, Mother.

Goodnight.

Mrs Tuck.

Mrs Tuck!

Abdul.

You have been an utter fool.

And I am absolutely furious with you.

It it unconscionable
that as my Munshi

you should have
lied to me in any way.

But it would be also
completely churlish of me

not to recognise the considerable
kindness and devotion you've shown.

I suppose in some way
you thought you were protecting me.

But as the monarch,
I realise

that nothing
can really protect me.

And so in that light
I have decided, although

I'm very disappointed,

that I want you to stay.

Your Gracious Majesty!
Thank you.

Your Majesty!

Abdul,

there is something we must sort out.

I am deeply concerned
about Mrs Karim.

Mrs Karim?

By now, one would be expected

to hear the pitter-patter
of little Muslim feet

along the corridors
of Osborne House.

I am concerned
that everything is

functioning below sex.

I want you to examine
Mrs Karim.

Examine Mrs Karim?

Hmm.

Just uh, make sure
that everything's... working.

But Your Majesty, I...

I thought the Munshi and his family
were leaving us.

Whatever gave you that impression?

The Munshi and his family are
integral parts of the Royal Household.

<i>As far as I'm concerned</i>

this is war.
We're going to dig up

every last bit of dirt
this blaggard's ever done.

I want someone in India
raking through the family coals.

Your son's out there,
isn't he, Ponsonby?

I couldn't possibly be involved
in subterfuge, Your Royal Highness.

Look, very soon
I am going to be King.

You will bloody well
do as you are told!

You'll leave no stone unturned.

You will make a dossier

and you will put it all down
in black and white.

And put an end
to all this shit!

For good.

Well, I better go
and examine Mrs Munshi.

Oh, Dr Reid.

Do come in.

She'll have to uncover her face.

That is impossible, sir.

I need to see her tongue.

Well?

She's fine.

Mr Mohammed.

We have come here because
we are not unaware

of your predicament.

That you arrived in the first place
almost by accident

and now find yourself stuck here

through a bizarre
set of circumstances

none of your own making.

Nor is it beneath our notice that

the uh, inclement English weather

has been the cause
of a precipitous decline

in your general health.

What is more,

you continue to suffer
the vast indignity

of being a servant to someone
who is in many ways

your inferior.

So, it occurred to us that, um

we might be able to
offer you some help.

Help?

Travel home.
Perhaps a modest pension.

In return, of course, for um

a little information.

You want me to

dish the dirty?

In a manner of speaking.

What would you like me to say?

Anything really.

Well, we need details.

What he says.

What he does.

Abdul does what
everyone else does.

He uh,

He looks for preferment.

He curries favor.

He crawls up
the stinking greasy pole

of the shitty British Empire.

Making fools of
all of you because

he is a servant.

An Indian, Muslim servant

and you are all
quaking in your boots because

he's beating you
at your own game.

No one is quaking in their boots.

We are the most
powerful nation on Earth

at the height of our influence.

In that case,

the only way is down.

So stick your stupid British Empire

up your stinky royal bottomhole,
Mr Bertie Prince, sir.

I hope he makes the whole
damn thing come tumbling down.

I will see to it
that you die here.

He didn't say anything.

What do you mean,
he didn't say anything?

We did our best with him, but I...

He spoke most intemperate...

The man is an absolute shit.

Dr Reid!

I'm not a fool.

I know there is some
skulduggery afoot.

Something's going on here.

And I'm not going to stand for it.

Dr Reid,

I asked you to get to the bottom
of Mrs Karim's fertility issues.

It seems that nothing has been done.

Oh, well, actually, Your Majesty,

it was impossible to make
a conclusive judgement

for religious reasons.

Did you examine the Munshi?

No, Your Majesty.

Well, examine the Munshi.

Bertie.

I did not do seven years at
Edinburgh University

to look at Indian dicks!

Trousers.

Eureka!

He is riddled with the clap!

Well, well.

Mother, we have to see you.

Alone.

I'm in the middle of my Urdu lesson.

Mother, we come with
very important news

of a highly personal matter.

I have nothing to hide from Abdul.

Please, Your Majesty.

Your Majesty, um,

I'm afraid our news concerns
the Munshi, um

We have proof beyond any doubt

that Abdul Karim is a

a low-born impostor.

Your Majesty.

The Munshi is from a noble family

and a long line of teachers.

No, I'm afraid he was a mere
clerk in a common jail.

My own son has
sent word from India

and has actually spoken
to his immediate superior.

His family are completely uneducated.

His father is a lowly apothecary.

The Munshi never even
went to school, Mother.

The man's a complete fraud.

And here he is,
overlooking the boxes.

I'm afraid it's true,
Your Majesty.

Abdul and his father
are completely common.

We have prepared a dossier.

You despicable toads!

Racialists!

Spying, dossier?

Picking on a poor defenceless Indian.

Of course he doesn't have
qualifications.

They do things completely
differently out there.

But don't you see, Ma-mah,

he's using his position
for his own gain.

And how does that make him
any different from any of you?

How <i>dare</i> you look down on Abdul.

How dare you defame his poor father.

Bertie, I am ashamed
that you are part of all this.

Abdul is a loyal, wise,
sympathetic human being.

Who has raised himself
on his own merits.

Bring Abdul in here.

Bring him in!

Now I want you to repeat after me.

I will be courteous to the Munshi.

I-I will be courteous to the Munshi.

You.

I will be courteous to the Munshi.

Bertie, all of you.

I will be courteous to the Munshi.

I will be courteous to the Munshi.
I will be courteous to the Munshi.

It has become apparent

that in order to get
any respect from the Household

one needs to be formally recognised.

In which case, Abdul

I intend to give you a knighthood
in the next honours list.

Enough! This is absurd.

We cannot protect you
from this any further.

The man is riddled with gonorrhoea.

Gonorrhoea?

Yes, Your Majesty.

Well, you are a doctor.
Why don't you treat him?

Now get out of my sight!
All of you.

Listen, you pox-ridden
Indian shit!

Why don't you bloody well
leave her alone!

Dr Reid!
Be courteous!

Knighted?!

Surely there is some law against it.

The man's a common Indian,
for God's sake.

She can't just do what she likes.

That's right. <i>We</i> are the ones
who make this palace work.

And we are being
ignored and exploited.

We have to stand up
to this wanton bullying.

But she's the Queen.

She's <i>our</i> sovereign.

Her position is based entirely

on the <i>implicit</i> contract
she makes with us.

If she does not drop
this preposterous insult,

we should all leave!

Hear!

Somebody has to tell her.

We should make a deputation.

I think you should go.

You're the head of the Household.

Well, no, I couldn't possibly go.

It would bring the
position into disrepute.

Mrs Tuck.

You know her very well,
don't you?

But I'm just her dresser.

What about you, Miss Phipps?

Off you go.

And don't take no
for an answer.

Your Majesty.

Out with it, girl.

Can't you see I'm busy?

There is something
I must say that uh...

What is the meaning of this?
Stop shaking.

I've come to ask you to
reconsider the uh...

the elevation of

of Mr Karim.

What did you say?

I've come to ask you
not to give Mr Karim

a knighthood, Your Majesty.

Why the devil not?

The members of the Household

demand that you abandon
your plans, Your Majesty.

Demand?

We believe that it degrades
the very concept of knighthood.

He comes from a very low family,
Your Majesty.

And

he is coloured.

Get out of my sight.

Did you not hear me?

Your Majesty, I must inform you
that if you refuse

the entire Household will resign.

Treason!

Treason!

Treason.

Mummy.
Enough is enough.

You will drop this
Munshi business forthwith.

Do you hear me?!

Did you really think the

the Household would
countenance such an insult?

I will not be disobeyed.

No. No.

I have put up with you
for over fifty years!

You will drop this forthwith, or...

Or, or, or, Bertie?
Or...

We will have you
certified insane.

And removed from office
immediately.

Here are the papers
signed by Dr Reid.

I'm eighty-one years of age.

I've had nine children,

and forty-two grandchildren,

and have almost
a billion citizens.

I have rheumatism,

a collapsed uterus,

am morbidly obese,

and deaf in one ear.

I have known eleven
prime ministers,

and passed 2,347
pieces of legislation.

I have been in office
sixty-two years, 234 days.

Thus I am the longest-serving
monarch in world history.

I'm responsible for five Households.

And a staff of over
three thousand.

I am cantankerous,

boring,

greedy,

fat,

ill-tempered,

at times selfish and myopic,

both metaphorically
and literally.

I am, perhaps,

disagreeably attached to power

and should not have smashed

the Emperor of Russia's egg.

But I am anything but insane.

If the Household wish
to disobey me, so be it.

Let them do it to my face.

I will see everyone
in the Durbar Room at once.

Her Majesty, the Queen.

I understand

there is some concern over
my desires on preferment.

I understand feelings have run high

and I understand
you have decided to resign

rather than withstand my decision.

If any one of you

wishes to tender their resignation

it will be accepted

without any
unfortunate consequences.

But at least have the decency
to do it to my face!

Anyone wishing to resign,
please step forward.

Hmm.

I would like to inform you
that I have decided

against awarding any knighthoods
at this moment.

Instead, you'll be delighted to know

that I have decided

to make the Munshi

a Commander of the
Royal Victorian Order

as a special token
of my personal esteem

for his services to the Empire.

That is all.

Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

Are you all right?

Dr Reid!

Dr Reid!

Dr Reid!
Shh, shh, shh.

Dr Reid, you must come quick!
Not now.

Dr Reid!
It's Mr Mohammed!

Get that boy!

Your Majesty,
can you hear me?

Your Majesty?

I am sorry, my friend.

I'm so sorry, Abdul.

I think it's time
you went home, Abdul.

This <i>is</i> my home.

I've been short-sighted
and selfish.

You are a young man.

You have your whole life
ahead of you.

It's not safe here.

Your Majesty...

The vultures are already circling.

How can I protect you
if I'm not here?

Your Majesty, you will reign
for many years to come.

No, Abdul.

I'm sick.

All these stupid ceremonies
will kill me.

You have been
a very good friend.

But you must leave me.

I'm your servant.

And as long as I shall live

I shall be by your side

every single day.

Nothing.

Nothing will stop me.

Abdul, I am your Queen.

Your Majesty,
I am your Munshi.

And I will never leave you.

You are a fool.

But I adore you.

I think you should
inform the Kaiser.

Abdul...

Abdul...
It's me, Mummy.

And your grandson, Wilhelm.

Where is my Munshi?

The Kaiser.
I need my Munshi.

Hush, hush.
Everything will be all right.

I want my Munshi.

Don't you dare upset her.

I want to talk
to the Munshi alone.

I-I think perhaps Your Majesty...

I said alone.

When I was young

I used to long for death.

Now when there
is nothing to live for

I cling to life with every breath.

I am scared, Abdul.

Don't be scared.

'Listen, little drop

'give yourself up
without regret

'And in return
you will gain the ocean

'Give yourself away

'And in the Great Sea
you will be secure.'

Rumi.

You are a teacher, Abdul.

Everybody knows Rumi.

Allah is the teacher.

Love is the whole.

We are only pieces.

I keep thinking

I'm falling.

Fall.

All will be well.

You are about to go
to a much safer place.

To the Banquet Hall of Eternity.

Yes.

Goodbye,

my Queen.

Goodbye.

Take care,

my sweet son.

Let her sleep.

I grieve to say

Her Majesty passed away
at six-thirty precisely.

Long live the King.

We belong to Allah.
To Allah we return.

Get out of the way!

I want every last thing
that's connected to her.

Abdul!

Abdul, they are burning everything.

I want you out of here.

Immediately.

No! Your Majesty!

Come, my dear.

Take it.

Keep it safe.

Good morning, Your Majesty.

How are you today?
