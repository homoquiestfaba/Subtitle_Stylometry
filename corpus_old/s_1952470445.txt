Come on!

Come on, bastards.

It's time to bet.
That's what you came for.

Come on! Come on!

Come on, move, buddy!

Come on, Jimmy!

Get up! Get up!

Fast! Fast! Fast! Move!

I screwed you, asshole!

Give me my share.

Go wash your face instead.
You look terrible.

THE KID

DO NOT ENTER

Get out of my gym.
We're not into charity work here.

Get out of my gym, you slacker.

Listen, don't let that kid in here.

Listen.
Yes?

Can I leave
when my girlfriend comes out?

No, you're next, Abner.

And can't I leave earlier?

Take a seat until you're called.

Now...

this one's for three months,
one per day, all right?

No, I don't need them, Doctor.
They're just in case...

Yes, sure. Just in case.

My mom thinks
it's better to be cautious.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

Come on in, Abner.

I'll be waiting for you.

Take a deep breath, please.

Your son's still a professional fighter?
Do it again.

Isn't Irwin your surname?
Yes. Breathe.

All right, perfect.

He's no longer in magazines.
I don't know. Take a seat, please.

How's your asthma going?
I'm fine, Doctor.

The drug has helped a lot.
Good.

What?

A prescription.

Give it to Maria.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Boxing and asthma don't blend well.

If you need anything...
I'll be here.

Mom.

Come.

Got a condom?
What are the pills for?

Do you think they work from day one?

What's up, dude?
Everything's cool?

Hey, Wilo.

I'm gonna be a champion
like Marco Antonio Barrera, you'll see.

Dreaming is free, my friend.

You rather remind me
of that Alejo Morales, buddy.

The guy's 100% from Tijuana.

Cheer up, Californian sunshine.
Hey, let me be, dog.

Look. I'm as drunk as Morales.
I'm gonna be a champion, buddy.

Don't I look like one?
Yeah, right.

Come on, have some.
No, thanks.

Excuse me, honey.

Being with him pays off.

I think of my girl
while he's sucking my dick.

I'll see you later, honey.

All right.
Take care.

Let me go...
Let go of me!

What did you say?
No!

Don't hit me!
Let her go!

Abusive bastard.

She's a whore just like her mother.

Worthless pig.

No one hits their father.
Get out, Ana.

All right, hit the road, you both,
just like dogs.

And don't you come back!

Motherfuckers.

Will you do some here?

I can't. I got school.

Hey, where are you going?
Me?

Let's see...

I think we're in trouble already,
aren't we?

Look, you will help me
with something, okay?

Listen, you bastard.
Don't talk back to me like that.

Do you think I don't know
you're a junkie?

That's not true.
Leave me alone, please.

"Please," no.

You're going to be
my petite snitch.

You will tell me who you buy this from
and who you sell it to.

You will pay me on a weekly basis
if you don't want to end up in prison.

Is that clear?

Take them.

I said I'd have the money for the gym
by tomorrow.

No one will ever touch me, dog.

How much do you need?
I can help you get it.

And you'll be my assistant, huh?
You'll be my second.

Your "second"?

That sounds cool.

I mean my assistant.
Really?

Sure.

Hi, beauty. How much?
Seven hundred.

Get in.

Hi, Tere.
Hi, girl.

Can I have room 5?

Yeah, bro.
That's how it happened.

How are you all doing?
Hey, what's up?

Where were you?
Looking for you, dog.

Wait, what's that about?

What?
Can't I be happy to see you?

How can you afford them?
I sell them.

No shit? Since when?
I do it for money.

I'll make good money.
You'll see.

And what happens in the meantime?

Thank you.

Yes?

Frank, there's your son.

A bit higher!

What's up?

What's up?

What do you want?

You've come here again?

If I learned how to box,
Don Poncho.

Don't call me "Don,"
and we don't do charity here.

Please.

I just want to learn how to box.

There are some old gloves
back there.

For the record,
you're doing it at your own risk.

Listen. It's $200.

One month.

There's the girl. Pull up.

Get in, Paulina.

<i>We got an emergency.
Send two cars.</i>

It wasn't Abner, I promise.
It wasn't me, either.

The problem is they'll lock you up
if you can't prove that.

And so what?
That will affect me negatively

because I need you here
out on the street, working,

not in jail, you understand?

Hello?

I'm Dr. Frank Irwin.

Manuel.
My pleasure, Manuel.

American?
Yes.

I'm a resident.
Is this official business?

Good, good.

Officer Manuel Quintana.

Your English is very good.

Thank you!
You're welcome.

See to it that the money is returned.
Excuse me.

Let's get going.

Thank you, Doctor.

You don't knowwhat you saved us from.
Yes, I do.

It's the last time.
How much?

Okay, no secrets, right?
That's right.

800 pesos.
What for?

To pay for the gym.

For Abner?

Yes?
Tell him to come and see me.

You understand?

That bastard caught me,
and now he's got me selling for him.

You see?
What are you going to do now?

Do I have a choice?

It's all fucked up, right?

The thing is I have less money now.

You wanted two, right?
Yes.

How much is this?
100.

No, it's 100 each.

Who did that to you?
My fucking father.

You should send him to hell.
Come to my place.

Abner stood up for me.

He adores you.

Please, don't tell him you saw me.
I gotta go.

Well, Doctor...

Rigoberto, this gentleman here
has offered to pay you back

the money that you accuse your son
of stealing from you.

And who's the guy?

He's the guy who'll pay you back,
all right?

Please.

You could still scare the damn kid
so he learns his lesson.

You got your money already.
I'll take care of the rest.

Whatever you say,
my beautiful Manuelito.

Give him a scare?
Don't worry about a thing.

Nothing will happen to the kid.
I'll see to that.

Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you very much.

You're welcome.

Your jaw.

Your bending, your bending.

Your waist, your waist.

Do it all over again and tough!

Repeat everything.

Time's up!

Kid... kid...

Would you like to spar with him?

We have no protection.

But we do.
Come on, just some short rounds.

Tomorrow perhaps.

What, your fighter is scared?

All right, then.
But that guy's a pro.

He'll beat you up.

It's 80 pesos,
you know, because of the traffic.

Easy, bro, huh?
We're ready.

Come on, cover up!
Come on, yes, come on!

Wear him down.

Cover up!
Body and head.

Body and head.
Cover up!

Come on, go for him.

Cover up!
Your teeth.

Wear him down.

Cover up!
Come on, cover up!

Cover your face.

Follow him.
Come on.

Your waist.

Come on, come on.

Get out of there.
Go to him, come on.

Yes.
Get out of there!

Wear him down.
That's it.

That's it.
Get out of there.

Cover up, cover your face.
A hook!

Yes, that's just right.

Cover up!
Beat him up.

Get out of there.

Again.

Repeat that.

One, two...

Let me see, kid.

You're fine, man.
It's nothing.

What the fuck, Raul.
What have you done?

Don't come to the gym
to take advantage of newbies.

It's no big deal.
Just for fun, Ponchito.

And you should learn your lesson.

You get angry, you lose.

Let's go.
Just ignore them.

Let me see.

Excuse me.

How much?

You are a pro, right?

It's 200 pesos a week.

Very cheap... cheap.

And I'm Poncho.

Good evening.
Is Dr. Frank in?

Thanks.

You're welcome.

Good morning.

Good morning.
Take a seat.

Listen, young man.

I paid back the money
you stole from your father.

You understand?
I didn't steal it.

He owed it to me
for all the fights I've won.

Look, he keeps all the bids
for himself.

He takes as much as he can
from my sister and me.

Now I understand.

Want some eggs?
Thanks.

Good, there's some beans,
orange juice...

I think it's broken.

Let's see.

It's not broken.

Boxing...

all that glitters is not gold.

Thanks for receiving me last night.
You're welcome.

I got a proposal.

Lend a hand at the clinic
and go to school,

and you can stay here.

Okay?

I don't wanna be a burden, Doctor.
Call me Frank, please.

I just want to be a professional boxer.

Like your son.

It was him last night, wasn't it?

Yes.

I can lend a hand at the clinic.

I'd stay here for just a few days.

As for school, we'll see, okay?

It's better than nothing.

Yes?

Where do you want...
I'm sorry.

Here's the key, Teresita.
Thank you, child.

No answer...

No answer.

Listen...

Hey, you...

You're the doctor's son, right?

Cool.

It's Jimmy Irwin
or something like that, in room 28.

Room 28?

Thank you, sweetheart.
Thanks.

What's up?

I'm training at the gym.

Yes, I can tell.
Look at your nose.

Listen.

Dad's looking for you.

You've been at the house?
And where else could I go?

Come with me.

No.

He needs me.
Cut the crap, Silvana.

Send him to hell
and come with me.

Listen, we'll talk later.

What are you doing?
Nothing. Just talking, but I'm done.

Yeah, I saw.
But you're working, right?

Yes.

Jimmy?

Thanks.

Abner... my angel.

A coach, yes.

Yeah, I think he does need one.

Jesus Christ? Why?

One lesson... tomorrow.

But, please, don't tell Abner that...
I'm sorry.

Howwas that?

What's up, daddy?

Hi... It's 800.

Do you like me?
Hello, handsome.

Hi, doll. How much?
It's 700.

Ana.
Hey, now here's a miracle!

Where were you?
Someplace.

I went out with Jimmy.
Jimmy?

Oh, the gringo?
Yes.

I think he likes me.

And do you like him?
Yes.

That's so cool.

I'm not too hopeful, though.

Listen, Xavier is pissed off.
He's looking for you.

He says he'll beat you up
the moment he finds you.

He should think twice...
because my boyfriend's a boxer.

He'll end up injured.

And doesn't he have a friend?

What do you think, kid?
You've got someone to train you.

Yeah.

Wouldn't a Mexican be better?
They're the best.

Yes, that's true,
but none sees your potential.

Just this guy.

Thank you, huh?

Thanks.

Good morning, Eduardo.
Morning.

Hi, Carmen.
Oh, potatoes.

Potatoes?
Please, pick them yourself.

All right.
How are you doing?

Good, thanks. And you?
Fine, thanks.

It's 10 pesos.

Okay, here you are. Thank you.

Thanks. Good-bye, Carmen.
Good-bye, Eduardo.

Good-bye, see you later.

Fast.

Thanks.

Thank you very much.

Better, huh?

Breathe... Good.

I thought you weren't coming.
I'm sorry.

Elias, what's up?

Okay.

Hello.
Hi, Dr. Frank.

I'll be right back.

Hello?

I'll be there in a minute.

Your blood pressure is too high,
but you don't have a fever.

Look this way.

Now this way.

This way.

Calm down.

Better?

Good.

No secrets, right?

Amphetamines, Doctor...

every single day.

Amphetamines could kill you.

What about Abner?

No, he hates them.

Are you sure?

I don't want my mom to find out.

Yes, yes. No problem.

But do help me.

Stay calm.

Come here.

Come.

All of you, come here.

If you're ready...

in two weeks' time
we'll have a fight for beginners.

Yes... I'm ready.

Is this enough oil and vinegar?

Yes, it's perfect.

Hello, boys.

Take a seat.

We'll need more salad
and more meat.

Sit down, my friends.

I'll have my first fight in two weeks.

I'm ready.

He's ready.
We're gonna be rich.

Let's see...

How come you're not selling anymore?

I quit taking them.

Besides I'm ill.

You're ill?

That's better because you won't take
half the pills I give you.

What about 2000 a week?

Leave me alone.
I want out, please.

Drive up to him.

Two thousand, huh?

What's your business with that jerk?

He feels entitled to slap your ass
just because?

I told him I want out
and that I won't...

Now he's got you selling for him,
next he'll have you suck his dick.

You think? Should I wait
till you earn something boxing?

You only think of yourself.
You don't even listen to me.

This is just like...

Yes.

All right,
but you tell her to be there.

Tonight, okay?
Yes, that's fine.

All right, bye.

Time's up!

Ask him what about him and Silvana.

Why me?

Because your English is better.

Ask him yourself.
She's your sister.

Can't you fucking ask him?

Don't talk like that, dude.

I don't want to see
the two of you together again.

Sir, you've got a phone call.

Thanks.

Who the fuck are you?

What's up?

What is it?

Silvana's been murdered.

How?

Jimmy's in prison.

Listen...

Listen...

Motherfucker,
I told you to stay away from her.

Hey, no shouting in here.

Get out of here!

Get out!

Let go of me!

Fucking murderer! Why?

Let go of me!
Fucking murderer!

Take it easy, dude.

You need to be in shape for the fight.

Calm down, champion.

Don't call me a champion.

Why couldn't she just run away?

What's up, bastard?
Fuck off, you fag!

Fuck off, you sucker!

Come here.

Forgive me.

I was awful with you.

I love you very much.

And I love you.

And I'm here with you.

You'll need all of your energy
for your first fight.

No sex, dude.

Come on, champ.

Thank you, sir.

177 pounds.

You may step down.

Next fighters, Abner Torres
and José Daniel Evangelista.

132.7 pounds.

I'll hit you so fast,
you'll think you're surrounded.

What's your problem?
Easy, boys!

Raul, I'm warning you,
make sure your kid behaves himself.

And you, kid,
where's your coach?

I can't let you fight
without your coach.

That's official.
And why not?

That is official.

This is my coach.

Pardon me?
My coach.

It's okay, Doctor.
We'll pretend you are his coach.

Is that all right?
All right, thanks.

I don't know anything.

This is Wilo.
It's a pleasure.

Nice to meet you.

132.4 pounds.

Behind the bars, dude.

Like this?
All right, here.

Please, wait a minute.

What the hell,
I'm not Jimmy.

Set your legs like this.
That's right.

Over here?
Yes. Keep them firm.

That's it. Here.
Okay, one, two...

That's right.

Ready?
We only have five minutes.

Okay?

It wasn't Jimmy.

Don't talk to him about that.

His sister's death still affects him.

I'm sorry.

She was my friend.

I loved her very much.

I'm going to see Abner.

Come with me.

Silvana wanted for you
to take care of him at the fight.

Round one!

In the red corner,
Santa Julia's pride...

Abner "The Kid" Torres!

In the blue corner,
lztacalco's idol...

José Daniel Evangelista!

On this occasion,
the referee will be

Rafa "Blond" Saldivar!

Boys, come nearer.

I want a fair fight.

Low blows are forbidden.

When you hear the bell,
you must stop fighting at once.

When I say to separate,
you separate.

Any questions?
Any questions?

All right, touch gloves.

It's on.

You can win.

Come on! Come on!

Hit him hard!

Destroy him, buddy!

Break it up!

I said break it up!

Go after him again!

Scum!

Break it up! Break it up!

Three... four...

Five...

Time's up!
Go to the corners.

Are you all right?

What's he doing here?

We need him.
No, I don't want his help.

No, it's very important.

Kid...

Go inside.

Straight punches.

Follow him.
He keeps pulling back.

Stay on him all the time.

Don't pull back.

This round is yours.
Go for it!

Relax.

Relax.
You can win.

Stay calm. Come on!

On guard!

Block his blows!

You're welcome, son.

Break! Break it up!

Time's up! Time's up!
To the corner!

Jimmy is very sorry about Silvana.

He lost her, too.

I'm truly sorry.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

You're letting your guard down.

Stay on top of him.
Don't let him go.

Stay on him.

Take care.

Break it up! Break it up!

One... two...

Stand up!
Three... four...

The fight continues.

Break it up! Break it up!
Time's up! Go to your corners.

It's all right. We're tied.

Come nearer, boys.

Come nearer.

Ladies and gentlemen,

according to the score
given by the judges

the winner of this fight
by a unanimous vote

is Abner "The Kid" Torres!

Yeah! Yeah!

I love you, my son.

May God be with you.

Hey, Jimmy.

I can speak a little Spanish.

And so do you.

Hi, Jimmy.
How are you doing?

Good. It was a tie.
Very good.

So it's time to pay.
Yes, Don Poncho. I will pay you.

In ten months...
he will go to the Olympics.

We'll talk later.
Thank you, Don Poncho.

So... what about you?

THE KID
