Hey, l'm not finished talking!

Han-kyung!

This... Didn't you send this by mistake?

Forgive me, Han-kyung! Sorry!

Tae-sung asked me to break you two up

l never thought it'd get so big...

Don't lie! Tae-sung wouldn't

Who are you?

Tae-sung, he's your brother, right?
He asked me to do it

Tae-sung and l are old friends

Boy, he could sure act yesterday

Why the hell are you doing this to me?

Why? You'd have to ask him

To love your own sister

What kind of cruel joke is that?

Don't you feel sorry for him?

lt's all lies, isn't it?
You! Why... Why...

Han-kyung!

What are you doing?

l said, what are you doing!

Hae-won, look at this
Bo-jung, are you okay?

Bo-jung Lee!
Enough! Didn't you see

her fall and hit her head!

Yo-won, take her to the infirmary

Tae-sung, that bastard
l knew this would happen!

She's acting right now!
Why don't you believe me?

Believe you? Believe you

after you left yesterday like that?

Bo-jung's tricking you right now!

Whatever kind of girl she is

whatever her game is with me

l don't care about people
l have no interest in

What makes me mad is you!

Han-kyung, you!

Are you still suspicious
of me and Tae-sung?

You still don't know
who l really like?

Me?! To be honest, it's hard for me

to watch you two

ls that how little you trust me?

You really can't trust me?

Go be with the person you really like!

lt'd be easier for both you and me

Alright

l'm also really tired of you

thinking of Tae-sung and me that way

Go to Bo-jung who likes you...

Bo-jung Lee!

You dare make my sister cry!

Are you really okay?

Should we go to the hospital?

Tae-sung...

You really don't know a Bo-jung Lee?

don't know?

No... Why?

Tae-sung, it's Bo-jung!

Who are you?

Tae-sung, it's me, Bo-jung

Han-kyung and Hae-won finally broke up

l did good so buy me a dinner
like you promised, See you later!

What the hell are you talking about?

Hey, hey

[l got beat up cause of you
so you owe me lots of drinks! Bo-jung]

You

Are you really the Tae-sung l know?

How can you do this to me?

What's this about you and Hae-won
breaking up? And this text...?

Even if you liked me
more than a sister...

This is wrong

l don't know what's going on!

l'm going now

Nuna!

Nuna! Nuna!

You think l broke you two up?

l trusted you l really did

lt wasn't me! You're wrong!
Why don't you believe me?

Let's talk later

Guess you are young
Soaking in the rain

Hey! Where's this Hae-won jerk?

Go ask someone else
Come here...

These youngsters, they never learn

Man, you got a temper...

Cheer up

Wanna hear some good news?

Tae-sung, he got totally beat up
and they're dragging him away

Those thugs beat him like a wet dog

Hey

Yo, Hae-won, welcome!

We were waiting for you

Chicken shit...

Watcha doing beating on a kid?

Hey

How'd you get here?

Heard you got the crap
beat outta ya, stupid!

You guys here to fight?
Or chat?

That bastard's mine

Tae-sung!

You okay, Tae-sung?

Tae-sung, you alright?

You okay?

Bo-jung Lee...
Who the hell is she?

That's cool
When are you coming back?

Well...

Maybe l won't?

Please don't!

Exactly what l was hoping

Hae-won, l have a favor to ask

What?

While l'm gone...

Take good care of my sister

You don't need to ask, idiot...

Go running to her when she calls,

buy her lots of food
and call her often...

and call her nuna!

Well, that might be a problem

And also...

Man, we'll see each other again
Why are you asking all at once?

And also what?

And...

Han-kyung Jung!

Ooh, that must hurt

l told you to stay away from Hae-won

She can't trust her boyfriend
she can't trust her brother...

How can a guy love his sister?

Right? That's really whacked...

l can't forgive you, l can't
So you won't forgive, so what!

Ooh! Bo-jung's really mad
Why do you think l'm here?

See this?
Hey! You bitches!

Damnit

You bitch! You wanna die, huh!

l just did what Jae-hee told me to!

Ha! You said it'd be fun!

Just kill him

Hey, you told me to

You all same kinds

Hae-won, leave them to me

You two are dead!

Tae-sung asked me not to tell you

but you'd probably hate me forever
when you found out

You can't go like this, Tae-sung

Nuna

l didn't think l could
get on that plane if l saw you

Nuna... ln our next life
