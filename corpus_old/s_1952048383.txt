It's a reporter from Aiken.
Wants to talk to you about the memorial.

Go to class.

Anna- Oh. Sweetheart,
what they said to you was trash, wasn't it?

And what do you do with trash?
You throw it away.

That's right.
You throw it away for good.

Okay, dry your tears and go on to class.
Yes, ma'am.

but I know these children pretty well.

I understand.
You will soon enough.

Oh, Sarah Malcolm.

Well, I'd been wanting to meet the new teacher.

You're not from around

No.
<i>- [Bell R/ngs]</i>

Well, day one.

<i>[Door Opens]</i>

Didn't your parents

You supposed to listen

I got complaints too. What about the fact
that you're late more than you are on time...

and when you are here, you flap
your lips more than you work.
You don't talk to me that way.

Okay, you're fired.
You can't fire me.

I just did.

What am I 'posed to do
for a job in this town?

Why don't you go back to L. Donn,
or you can cry about your leg to somebody.

Go talk to the V.A.
You'll get a job. It worked here, didn't it?

My name is Ray Harris from the <i>A/ken Standard.</i>

I'm doin' a piece about
the upcoming memorial for Paul Malcolm.

I wanted to get your thoughts-
I got nothin' to say.

Well, I'd really like
to get your viewpoint for the article.

This is a big event in town.

Well, I don't think
I'm gonna be an honored guest.

Will you answer a few questions
about your investigation of Malcolm's murder?

Didn't nobody answer 'em for me.

How you gonna arrest somebody
for sittin' at a lunch counter?

You know this isn't right.

<i>S/nce when /s be/ng hungry</i>

<i>You ask/n'the wrong quest/on, Sarah.</i>

What you need to be askin' is what

What you gonna say about

What you gonna say about that?
<i>- [Sarah] What you gonna say, Sher/ff?</i>

<i>You can't see what's ahead of you.</i>

<i>Don't hate the sher/ff, y'all.</i>

<i>Y'all need to p/ty h/m.</i>

<i>- [Man] That's r/ght.</i>

And it's gonna roll right over him...

along with everybody else who

<i>- [Man] Mm-hmm.</i>

It's right around the corner,
and it's called "freedom."

<i>- [Man] Freedom, that's r/ght.</i>
<i>- [Raul] /t belongs to you.</i>

The same as everybody else.
<i>- [Man] That's r/ght.</i>

Now my hands are tied,

<i>- [Man] Amen to that.</i>
They gonna put me on the chain gang...

but they can't chain my spirit-

'Cause I carry the light.

And that light is called "truth."

Y'all carry it too.

You too, Sheriff. Come on.

Madam President?
Yes. Mrs. Malcolm.

Do you intend
to bulldoze Gospel Hill?

<i>[Man] Well, we're aware that</i>
<i>some of the land /s occup/ed.</i>

But we intend to offer
fair market value to everybody.

Tell me, what is fair market for the house
that your great-grandmother was born in?

Would you want to
sell that house?

<i>M/r/am, you cannot sell out Gospel H/ll.</i>
<i>/t /s not yours to sell.</i>

<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>Sarah, uh, maybe we should hear the man out.</i>

I mean, uh, this could be good
for these people.

Where are they gonna go, Ron?
Well, I know we're all
passionate about our heritage...

but we have to be realistic.

Oh, hell, Ron.
Give me a break.

You and I are blessed enough not even
to share the same reality as these poor folks.

Okay, uh, you can continue.

<i>[Man] Many homeowners are sell/ng</i>

<i>/n fact, most of the propert/es /nvolved</i>

<i>What's the appra/sal, Duncan?</i>

I'm saying $40,000 is what I'm saying.
I'm saying $40,000.

I'm worried about this,
uh, Sarah Malcolm.

She's committed.
It could be a problem.

Well, it's personal to her.
She'll come around.

And it's not personal to you,
now is it, Doc?

No. You have to rise above that.
Uh-huh.

I can handle Sarah.
[Chuckles] The way you
handled her last night, I guess.

Look, when she's done talking, she'll realize
she can't win, and the vote will go down.

Maybe we should
put a little sugar in her coffee.

That bring her around?
[Laughs]

Sarah Malcolm
ain't ever gonna go your way, boys.

I tell you right now,
you're better off playing hardball.

Hardball?
What are you talking about?

Look, look, stop.
Please. I can handle her.

Hey, if you don't,
we can always up the stakes a bit.

Look, I do not want to hear that.

Duncan, just don't get reckless on us.
Ahh.

Careful, it is.
Careful, it is, boys.

Uh, y'all, uh-
y'all take care now.

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>All r/ght. Take 'er easy, Duncan.</i>

You'd better deliver
what you say, Doc.

To me you're a honeybee
on a daisy.

But most of these Valley Corp boys
see you as a fly squatting on a cow pie.

Hey, L. Donn. That, uh, business
we were talking about?

Mm-hmm?
We need to go ahead with that.

<i>[Ros/e] So because of th/s</i>
<i>one l/ttle g/rl /n New Orleans...</i>

<i>- What's her name?</i>
[All] Ruby Bridges.

That's right. Because she was
brave enough to go into that school...

even though she looked
different from everyone else...

even though people called her names
and no one would sit with her, she still did it...

so that everyone could have
a better life.

<i>And th/s week we're celebrat/ng</i>

<i>He was a courageous p/oneer for soc/al just/ce,</i>

Great. Line up.


Hello?
[Ron] Sarah.

Ron Palmer.

You left so fast
we didn't have time to talk.

I talked, Ron.
I know, you did.

But these are powerful people.
Just work with them on this.

You know what this is about.

They will move you out of the way
if they have to, Sarah.

Just think about it.


Ohh!
Damn, man! What'd you do?

Can you grab a rag
out of the truck, please?

Hey, shit, man. You're gonna need
that thing attended to. I'll drive ya.

You can drive this?
Man, I can drive anything. Come on.

Come on.

That you?

Yeah, it's me. We cool?

Yeah, we cool.

I'm Joel.

Man, just keep putting pressure
on that thing. I'm Lonnie.

All right, you know
how to get to the hospital?

We're gonna go to the clinic right down the road.
Gospel Hill?

We all bleed the same, brother.
Come on.

[Engine Starts]

Aren't you gonna say hello?

John Malcolm.

Sometimes you are just
an impossible man, you know that?

Why is it every time something important
comes up- I mean, truly important-

you wanna go and stick your head
in the sand...

just like you do
in that damn pickup.

Well, what you expect me to do?
I expect you to stand up.

That's theJohn Malcolm
I once knew.

Proud man, wouldn't be caught dead
with his head down.

Where's he?
Hey, you're not being fair, Sarah.

Well, maybe not. But I need you on this,
at least to support me.

You can't fight them folks.
You just being simple, Sarah.

They want to build that golf course
over Gospel Hill. I saw their map, John.

Well, what does Ron Palmer say?

Oh, please.
He one of them behind it.


Maybe Palmer's right.

You don't mean that.

<i>Hey, l/sten, baby.</i>

They brought the factories here,
'cause there were poor people to work in 'em.

And they found poor people
somewhere else to take all the jobs.

Hey, listen, baby.

Maybe it's a golf course or nothin'.

Wait, Sarah. What I think,
what you think don't-don't matter.

It don't matter. It don't-

You got a ride home?

I just live right down the road.
I'm good.

Hey, let me give you something
for your troubles, man.
That won't be necessary, man.

I'll tell you what, though,
you gonna need some help around here now.

Oh, I don't think so, man.
Come on, man. I can do all you can do.

I can sharpen them mower blades,
don't mind the heat.

Just lost my job at the mill.
Man, I sure could use some work.

See, I'm kinda used
to working alone, so-

Well, you used to have two hands.
Now you got three.

I'm sorry, Lonnie.
I, uh- I don't think so.

Your call, brother.

<i>[Woman] We accept Med/care,</i>
<i>Med/ca/d, V/sa and MasterCard. Mm-hmm.</i>

<i>Mr. Herrod.</i>

Hi, Joel.
Hi.

I'm Ron Palmer. Sit over here.
Right up here for me, please.

How'd you hurt your hand?

Well, I was landscapin'.

Oh. How long have you been doin' it?
Uh, not long.

I actually just started my own company.
Oh.

Congratulations.
Thank you.

Oh, you're just gonna
need a few stitches.

You, uh-You're pretty crowded out here.
I haven't been here much at all really.

Well, why would you need to be?

Can I ask you, uh,
who does your landscaping?

Oh, my receptionist's son.

I throw him a bone every once
in a while whenever I can.

But, uh, between you and me,
he's a lazy kid.

Right.
[Chuckles]

Now I do have some rental properties
available if you're interested.

Really?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

I think I am interested.
<i>- Oh.</i>

We should talk about it.
This is gonna sting a little bit.

[Clears Throat]

<i>[Horn Honks]</i>

Hey.
<i>- H/.

Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

You forgot your bait.
Oh. Keep it.

You never know, right?

That's my scout.
[Chuckles] Right.

What happened to your hand?

Oh, nothin'.

I just cut it on this edger.

You should really hire someone
to do that for you.

I, uh- I do. Me.


Uh-

What are you doin' later?

I've got lesson plans.
I teach at the elementary school.

But I'm free Saturday night.
You are? I mean...

great.

I'll see you Saturday?

Yeah.

<i>[Knock/ng]</i>

Hi.
Hello.

Um, I'm Joel Herrod.

[Clears Throat] Dr. Palmer asked me to,
uh, come by and pick up some property list.

Oh, yes, of course.
Right.

Hang on one second.
Thank you.

There you are.
Oh, thank you.

Mmm.
All right.

You take care of that hand now.
Oh, I will.

<i>- [Yvonne S/ghs, G/ggles]</i>
What?

What you gigglin' about?
You'll never believe who that was.

I assume it wasn't your husband,
or I'd be shot through the head.


It's not like you to be worried
about jealous husbands.

I've skated by this long.

Mmm. That's what I like about you.

Carl, you're easy.

That's what they used to call me
in law school- easy.
Mmm.

Were you the best?

No, I skated.

My friends are movers and shakers now.

Well, didn't you ever want to be
a mover and shaker yourself?

I'm fine right where I am.

<i>- [Knock/ng]</i>
<i>- [Ron] Yeah, come /n.</i>

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>/'m so sorry, Dr. Ralmer, /'m late.</i>

<i>My old truck done broke down</i>
<i>and / had to walk.</i>

Oh, that's perfectly fine,
Calvin. Come on in. Sit down.

Make yourself comfortable.

I, uh- I won't keep you long.

I just wanted to share some good news with you.
I sure could use it.

Calvin, I don't want you
to worry about these medical bills...

that have been piling up on you.

Yes, Lord.
Oh.

Firstly, I'll make a few calls
and get the hospital off your back.

Now, secondly, I, uh- I see that there's
another property that you own next door.

And if you would, uh,
sell that to me as well...

<i>/ th/nk / can sweeten the deal</i>
<i>all the way around.</i>

Sir, I-I don't-
I don't believe I'm gonna be able to do that.

You see,
that was my granddaddy's land...

and it's been in the family ever since.

And I was hoping to leave it
to my kids after I'm gone.

I understand, Calvin.

Then I think, uh, $25,000
is what we should work with.

$25,000?

Sir, no disrespect, the house two doors
down went for almost $40,000.

$25,000 is what
the appraisal came in at.

I spoke with Mr. Duncan
at the bank this morning.

Dr. Palmer-

You-You know, you're gonna be
out of debt, Calvin.

Debt-free.
I'm gonna help you do that.

Just put your mark here.

See if you can get
some of the Lord, Luther. Prayer.

Hey.
Hey. What up, Joel?

How you doin'?
How's the hand, man?

It's gettin' better, you know.

Can I, uh-
I talk to you for a second?

Sure, man. What's up?

Well, uh, I actually came
into a bunch of work lately.

I was wonderin' if, uh-
Shit, yeah, man.

I could pay you, like, eight bucks an hour.
That's cool?
Eight bucks, man.

That's super cool, man.
All right. That's great.

Thank you, man.
Thank you.

All right, I'll see you soon then.
All right.

<i>All r/ght.</i>

I'm gonna call you, man.
All right.

You don't want to work for him.
His daddy's an asshole.

Man, he ain't his daddy.
They're all their daddy.

And what, that's gonna keep you
from gettin' a job, man?
I'm lookin'.

I thought it was easy for a vet,
especially one like you.

That's what you thought?
That's what you thought, huh?

Nigger, where the fuck
you live at?

I'm gonna get goin', Luther.

<i>- [Joel] You got those all r/ght?</i>
Yeah, I got 'em.


You all right?
Yes, I'm all right.

I just gotta
catch my breath a little.

What you need to do is just
quit those damn cigarettes.
Oh, yeah, you bet.

I'm serious.
Yeah, you're serious.

Boy, oh, boy.

Your mom and I used to sit in this swing
every night before goin' to bed.

Somethin' about this swing...

Seemed to make the day end right.

Got married in this house.

You know, you're not supposed
to see the bride before the wedding.

Yeah, I know.
[Chuckles] Well, when I turned around...

saw her standing there...

I figured... the rest of my life
was taken care of.

Yeah.

Niggers hadn't turned it
all to shit.

No, you know what?

You know what? You can say whatever
you want in your own home.

<i>But th/s? Th/s /s my home now.</i>
<i>Mom left /t to me.</i>

<i>Oh, / see. Well/</i>

You don't know what the hell
I'm talkin' about, do ya?

just doesn't understand, Dad.

When y'all gonna say
somethin' different to me?

No.

It's a waste of breath.

Contracts.

We have acquired

Doing well. Closed the deal.
Moving on to the, uh, bigger, better deal.

Mmm. That's good.

That's good?
What, that's all you can say, is "that's good"?

Ron, you know I don't care
nothin' about ownin' no houses.

Oh, it's not about the houses, Yvonne.
It's about the property.

The real estate. I mean,
these opportunities are too good to pass up.

There's opportunities everywhere.

What do you want to be,
the biggest catfish in the creek?

Are you-Are you happy
with this small-town living?

Yvonne, look. I'm doing all I can to build
this clinic so that we can get out of here-

I am tired of living in this
small country town.

Oh, not again.
<i>- Yes, aga/n.</i>

Look, I am sick and tired
of hearing this!

I don't come from what you do.

Your daddy didn't want to help us, and,
quite frankly, I didn't see you fight for it.

So this is how you do it. You see an opportunity,
you take advantage of it. You grab it.

Okay. Shoot.

It's about your dad.

I'm not my father.
No, I know. Absolutely not. I-I understand that.

It's just that I read all these articles
about Paul Malcolm before I moved here...

and how your dad was
this really popular sheriff.

Uh, so I hear. Yeah.

How come he couldn't
solve a murder...

in such a small town?

Well, he just couldn't.

Do you ever ask him about it?

Uh, no, I don't.

Why? L-You're his son.

I guess there's just things

Paul Malcolm bled to death

Just walking away like
we did tonight, you know?

I wouldn't worry about him.

Yeah. Well, he's not
your boss, so-

I don't know, Joel.
I don't think he's a good person.

I heard him at the city council
meeting the other night.

He had no sympathy for the people
affected by the Gospel Hill project.

I think he's affected.

I mean, he's got a lot
of properties in Gospel Hill.

He just wants to make money.

What's wrong with making money?

I mean, you gotta live
on somethin', right?

You can't displace people
to make money.

They've been living in those houses
for generations.

You know, maybe it's just business.
Maybe this golf course is what everyone needs.

Maybe everyone will benefit.

What?

I don't know.
Before I got Dr. Palmer as a client...

I was scrapin' by.

And now I got a ton of clients.
I can see myself gettin' out of debt.

And believe me,
I couldn't see that before.

I don't know. It just feels like...

It was too civilized really.

It was too civilized really.

Listen, Mr. Malcolm...

I've been teaching my students
about what happened here...

during the civil rights movement
in the '60s.

I know that it must've been really hard
for you to lose your father like that-

murdered by a white man.

How do you know
it's a white man?

Well, wasn't he?

I don't know that.

Somebody must know.

Yeah. Somebody must.

He was gunned down
in broad daylight.

There were witnesses around
that said they didn't see anything.

I mean, these were black people.
Ah, they had no choice.

Everybody has a choice.
Mm-mmm. No.

You have a choice.
Your parents have a choice.

Those folks had one choice,
the same as my daddy-

stand quiet or lie quiet.

I understand the choice
that your father made.

I didn't mind being their boy.

I thought it was
the road to the top.

I didn't believe that they-
they'd kill a man...

because he stood
between them and the bank.

And they ran right over me.

How could you live with that, Herrod?

I'm about done.

<i>[S/ghs]</i>

<i>That's the way /t /s for you.</i>

<i>But /t doesn't g/ve me</i>
<i>any sat/sfact/on.</i>

I'll go to my grave...

never having seen
the man that killed him.

What would you do
if you did?

[Exhales Deeply]

I don't know.

But I'd do somethin'.

Then I'll take ya.

Let's go.

[Brakes Screech]

<i>[Jack]</i>
<i>Ernest Hatch.</i>


Yeah?

I want you to meet...
John Malcolm.

<i>Th/s here /s Ernest Hatch.</i>

He was a-

a rich man's puppet, just like me.

Huh!

Ernest here is the man
that shot your daddy dead.

Is this what you want?

No.


No.

<i>[Rhone R/ngs]</i>




Well, hello, Doc.

You know you're not gettin'
it done with Sarah Malcolm.

But you know what this means to us.
It's time to play hardball.

We gotta stop her. L. Donn'll take care
of it. You just stay out of the way.

Good luck at the meetin'!

This is it, boys.
I think everything's gonna go our way.

I have a petition here signed
by members of our community stating that...

<i>we, /n effect, oppose</i>

<i>- [M/r/am] Mrs. Malcolm...</i>
Where is it written...

that what is good for the people
must not inconvenience the powerful?

[Murmurings]
Sarah, please. Enter the petition.

Sarah, that is not appropriate.

May I interject, please?

[Murmurings]
Oh, here we go.

Uh, yes. Come forward.

<i>L. Donn Murray?</i>

Yeah. What about it?

Go to hell.

<i>[Sarah]</i>
<i>M/r/am, / am st/ll speak/ng.</i>

Excuse me, Madam President.

I just wanted to ask if anybody
in this room was familiar...

with Antonio Gonsalvez,
attorney at law.

[Murmurings]
<i>- Dr. Ralmer?</i>

<i>You must know who he /s.</i>

<i>Mr. Gonsalvez was a commun/ty leader</i>
<i>/n Obregon, Texas.</i>

Where Valley Corp
built a casino resort.

With the support of Mr. Gonsalvez...

Valley Corp was able to displace
much of the Latino community...

with the promise of future employment
which never materialized.


<i>Fr/ends of m/ne /n</i>
<i>the Texas Attorney General's office.</i>

Have informed me
that Mr. Gonsalvez...

has received a sizable amount
of Valley Corp stock...

<i>/n exchange for help/ng to</i>
<i>shepherd th/s project through.</i>
Mm-hmm.

<i>Th/s sound fam/l/ar now, Dr. Ralmer?</i>

Most of my life l-

I lived in my f-father's shadow.

The darkness of that shadow
kept me from...

hearin' his true voice.

I grew up...

right- right down there.

That road right down there.

I was raised with
my father's love and kindness...

a-and a mission...
to do what's right.

I hope they grow up

Peace, brother.
Peace be with you.

<i>Mr. Malcolm.</i>

Considering the state of the country
and the recent shootings
of Dr. King and Senator Kennedy...

aren't you concerned
about your own safety?

Dr. King and Senator Kennedy
aren't the first to pass on.

There are people dyin' all over the world
for what they believe in.

No, no. No, I don't wanna die.

But I can't live in fear either.

That ain't livin'.

Only thing I'm afraid of is God.

And there have been many who
have fallen at the hands of others.

Men kill and men die...

but the world is still here.

When I'm gone-

when all y'all are gone-

the world will still be here.

And the work... will keep goin' on.

<i>- [Woman] Amen to that.</i>
<i>- [Man] Thank you, brother.</i>

<i>- [Woman #2] We're w/th you, Mr. Malcolm.</i>
<i>- [Man #2] Stay strong now.</i>

I love you, Pop.
