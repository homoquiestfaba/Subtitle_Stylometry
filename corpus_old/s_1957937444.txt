{\an8}<i>Oh, hey, y'all,
it's New Year's Eve in New York City.</i>

{\an8}<i>This is a story of a family
who needs a little help,</i>

<i>like we all do sometimes.</i>

{\an8}<i>Mom and Pop just can't seem to get along.
And Maria-Clara wishes they'd work it out</i>

{\an8}<i>and light up the dance floor
like they used to back in the day.</i>

<i>As the community turns out to celebrate,</i>

{\an8}<i>can some holiday magic
bring her parents back together?</i>

{\an8}<i>Hey, let's get this thing in motion
Block so hot got me full of emotion</i>

<i>Everybody's on the street</i>

<i>Feel the energy
From your head to your feet</i>

{\an8}<i>So crispy, fresh faded
Holiday's topnotch, upgraded</i>

<i>Turn up for New Year's Eve</i>

<i>Everybody getting ready
It's time to party</i>

{\an8}<i>It's my block, I started this function</i>

{\an8}<i>Back in the day
Where Hip-Hop was pumping</i>

{\an8}<i>And I don't say this casually
I love these folks like family</i>

{\an8}<i>And lemme tell you
About ones I watch over</i>

{\an8}<i>Here's an introduction
To take a look closer</i>

<i>Maria-Clara, she's the talk of the town</i>

{\an8}<i>Loves her parents
But they're bringing her down</i>

{\an8}<i>Whatever happened
To that night in the club</i>

{\an8}<i>When they first saw each other
And they fell in love?</i>

{\an8}<i>At the classic toy maker</i>

{\an8}<i>Drosselmeyer time breaker</i>

<i>She's got the vision
And she's making the plan</i>

{\an8}<i>Always got a little bit of magic at hand</i>

{\an8}<i>Old New
It's something like the fusion of the two</i>

{\an8}<i>Tradition with a twist
Modern music don't miss...</i>

<i>...It's finally time
Here's your last heads-up</i>

<i>We got the power
Light this whole place up!</i>

<i>Let's go!</i>

<i>Time...</i>

{\an8}<i>T... t... time is just...
T... t... time is just...</i>

<i>Time is just another game to play.</i>

Come on!

<i>Yo, it's me again, your man on the block</i>

<i>I've known all these kids
Since they started to walk</i>

<i>Let me talk a second, now, listen to me</i>

<i>Got good intuition
About the things that I see</i>

<i>Did you catch Maria-Clara
And The Nutcracker man?</i>

<i>Their chemistry is cracking
And I think I'm a fan</i>

<i>But just about the time
Love was sprouting up</i>

<i>This fool went and left
To go sell some nuts</i>

{\an8}<i>-Hey, you're gonna miss out</i>
-SIDE SINGER: <i>Miss out</i>

<i>Don't let the girl get away
It's a handout</i>

<i>She has a New Year's wish
That I heard about</i>

<i>To get her mom and dad
To work it all out...</i>

<i>Yeah!</i>

<i>...So that tonight, if things go right</i>

{\an8}<i>-Her parents will kiss by midnight</i>
-SIDE SINGER: <i>Midnight</i>

{\an8}<i>So, go help them find a spark
Might just help your spark to start</i>

<i>I'm Cool Peep, so I'll watch your cart
Hurry up</i>

{\an8}<i>before the love departs, go!</i>

<i>Snowflakes</i>

<i>Snowflakes</i>

<i>Throw your hands up, throw your hands up</i>

<i>If you're back in time
Throw your hands up</i>

<i>Throw your hands up, throw your hands up</i>

<i>If you're back in time
Throw your hands up</i>

<i>Another New Year's Eve
And I'm feeling terrific</i>

<i>Back in the day, yeah, non-specific</i>

<i>Where love first bloomed
When the vibes were right</i>

<i>I mingle but I tingle too
Two hearts, so bright</i>

<i>But let's not jump the gun
'Cause the night is still so young</i>

<i>So grab a partner, feel the beat
And both get locked in the song</i>

<i>See, I am your MC
And I'd like to say what's good</i>

<i>Drosselmeyer's spinnin' records
But she's also spinning time</i>

<i>She got the flow while I got the rhymes</i>

{\an8}<i>Keeps your eyes open
And your fists bumpin'</i>

{\an8}<i>There's magic on the dance floor</i>

<i>So keep the rhythm bumpin'
And your feet jumpin'</i>

{\an8}<i>To find what you're looking for</i>

<i>Put your hands up
It's time to take it back</i>

<i>Let's dance, DJ, spin that track</i>

<i>The correct spelling
of sweet is S-W-E-E-T.</i>

Yeah!

Go!

<i>Get up, get up, get up, get up</i>

<i>Get up, get up, get up, get up</i>

<i>Get up, get up, get up</i>

<i>Party</i>

<i>Party</i>

<i>Party</i>

<i>Party</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

<i>Yeah!</i>

Yeah!

{\an8}<i>Can I have some candy?</i>

Yeah!

<i>Yo, yo, get back to what you got to do
When time's runnin' out</i>

<i>You don't want to lose it
Mission is clear, but you gotta move fast</i>

<i>Fix their future, learn from their past</i>

{\an8}<i>The dance is the key
Now you're up to speed</i>

<i>Finally, now you got what you need</i>

{\an8}<i>It's almost midnight
The clock's gonna chime</i>

<i>Hurry up now, you can make it in time</i>

<i>Make it in time, make it in time</i>

<i>The dance is the key
You can make it in time</i>

Ten, nine, eight, seven,

six, five, four, three,

two, one.

Happy New Year!

<i>Yeah, now, we're back on the block
Where we got our start</i>

{\an8}<i>Now things are looking better
Now we got the heart</i>

{\an8}<i>I hope you had fun
'Cause we had a ball</i>

{\an8}<i>When we work together
Love conquers all</i>

<i>Holidays are a time
For magic and to catch up</i>

<i>With family and friends
They give you lessons to pick up</i>

<i>Like sometimes you can find love
On the dance floor</i>

<i>And sometimes you got to go back
To go forward</i>

<i>Community, they got your back
No matter the weather</i>

<i>Even through tough times
Movement brings us together</i>

<i>So everybody on your feet
You got one more chance</i>

<i>Now, shut this block down
Everybody, let's dance</i>

<i>Everybody, gather around
Strike a pose, give a look, what a time</i>

<i>Another New Year's Eve is in the books</i>

Happy holidays, y'all.

{\an8}<i>Clap your hands, everybody
If you got what it takes</i>

<i>'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow
And y'all need to know</i>

<i>That these are the breaks</i>

<i>Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car
Breaks to make you a superstar</i>

{\an8}<i>Breaks to win and breaks to lose
These here breaks to rock your shoes</i>

<i>And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up...</i>

<i>...If your woman steps out
With another man</i>

<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

<i>And she runs off with him to Japan</i>

<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

{\an8}<i>And the IRS says they wanna chat</i>

<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

<i>And you can't explain
why you claimed the cat</i>

<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

<i>And Ma Bell sends you
A whoppin' bill</i>

<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

<i>With 18 phone calls to Brazil</i>

<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

<i>And you borrowed money
From the mob</i>

<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

<i>And yesterday
You lost your job, baby</i>

<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

<i>Oh, well
Well, these are the breaks</i>

<i>Break it up, break it up, break it up...</i>

<i>...Brakes on a train, brakes on a plane
Breaks to make you go insane</i>

<i>Breaks in love, breaks in war</i>

<i>We got the breaks
To get you on the floor</i>

<i>And these are the breaks</i>

<i>Break it up, break it up, break it up
Break down...</i>

<i>...Break it up, break down</i>
