<i>Middleburg is a middle-size town</i>
<i>in the middle of the country.</i>

<i>But sometimes, in my dreams,</i>
<i>it felt like someplace else.</i>

<i>Somehow familiar,</i>
<i>but also very strange.</i>

<i>Middleburg is where i live,</i>

<i>and so does something... else.</i>

<i>Some people thought</i>
<i>middleburg was dull,</i>

<i>that nothing ever</i>
<i>happened here.</i>

<i>Well, they were very wrong.</i>

Francis?

Francis, time to
get up, honey.

Franny?

<i>My name is francis</i>
<i>bacon mccausland.</i>

<i>I'm fourteen years old.</i>

<i>That morning i was</i>
<i>extremely tired.</i>

It's so dark.

Must be a storm front moving in.

Not according to the barometer.

Maybe it's the
end of the world.

It sure feels like it.

How would you know what the
end of the world felt like?

You've never felt it
before, have you?

Maybe the clocks
are wrong.

Hope springs eternal.

I always set our clocks

by the naval
observatory web site.

I'll check it out.

Bert, trash, and don't
forget the paper.

Why do i always have to
take out the garbage?

Because with age comes
responsibility, bert.

When you go to college,
your sister, francis,

will take the trash out.

I wanna get a dog, so he
could eat the garbage,

and he could fetch
the newspaper.

Dogs have germs.

What would you do with it
when you went to college?

They don't allow dogs
in the dorm room.

Maybe you could put
it on the roof.

Get real, francis.

Grow up, bert.

Get a real grown-up.

Aw, jeez, what
happened to the eggs?

There were two dozen eggs
in the fridge last night.

Now there aren't any.

Cold cereal again.

I didn't do
anything with 'em.

No one's blaming
you, francis.

I'm the one they always blame for everything.

That's because you have so much pent up aggression.

I do not!

All right, you two!

We're not talking about
aggression right now.

That's what family
time is for.

Now we are simply
trying to determine

what has happened
to the eggs.

It's 4:23 a.m.

the clocks say 7:23.

The clocks are wrong.

I told you it was the
end of the world.

<i>It was hard to get</i>
<i>back to sleep.</i>

<i>I kept wondering why all the</i>
<i>clocks had been sped up.</i>

<i>But i knew there had to</i>
<i>be a logical explanation.</i>

Hee hee hee.

That's it. Come here.

Come here. Ha ha ha.

<i>Most kids my age go</i>
<i>to middle school,</i>

<i>but i skipped a grade.</i>

Hi, bert.

Hey.

<i>You shouldn't waste a</i>
<i>lot of time growing up.</i>

Jo?

Oh! Hi.

Hi.

So, um, why don't you want
to take the bus to school?

Joanne, nobody rides
the bus to high school.

It's just for children.

I wish i could skip a grade so i could go to high school.

Bert does have another year
after this, doesn't he?

If he's lucky.

Well, why do you care
when bert graduates?

Ahh... did i tell you
our alarm clocks

went off three hours
early this morning?

Really?

Yep.
And mom says the neighbor's clocks were wrong too.

Can you believe that?

Well, yeah. Our clocks
did the exact same thing.

They were all
three hours early.

It's so weird.

Well, it's only weird
because you don't have

a logical
explanation for it.

Uh, why is that
dog on the roof?

Now that's weird.

<i>Maybe it was some kind of</i>
<i>magnetic... you know... like...</i>

<i>like a power surge.</i>

<i>Why would that make</i>
<i>dogs get on the roof?</i>

I was talking about the
clocks being wrong.

Good morning, francis.

Good morning,
mr. Kepler.

He's my
biology teacher.

He really likes me.

Does he make you cut
up frogs and stuff?

That is <i>so</i> gross.

I <i>love</i> biology.

See, yesterday we got take this chicken embryo--

why is that guy
staring at us?

What... guy?

Well, we was
just right there.

Ok, francis.

I gotta get going, but i'll see
you here after school. Ok?

Ok.

Ah, gorgeous.

The egg, or ovum,

may be surrounded by as many as
three protective membranes.

Ha ha ha ha ha!

Ho ho ho ho! Hee hee hee hee!

Huh?

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

What is this?

That's the wonder
of the egg.

And now, the
secondary membrane--

do you have a question, francis?

Actually i do, mr. Kepler.

Ahh, did your alarm clock go off
three hours early this morning?

How could you know that?

Oh, a lot of clocks were wrong.

And, uh, see, i've been taking
a statistically accurate

sampling of the
whole school,

getting names, and addresses,
and phone numbers--

you know, to see if it
all happened in one area.

May i see
that, please?

Oh, yeah.

Who did this?

Do you know anything
about this, francis?

He was in your
science class?

Not really in
the class,

he was just sitting
on the shelf.

He was what?

Oh, look! There's
another one.

How'd you get up there in
the first place, charlie?

That is <i>so</i> weird.

What if a helicopter
flew over so low that

the dogs thought they
could catch it,

and chased it right
up the roof?

That's a logical
explanation, isn't it?

Sure, jo.

Hi, bert.

Whatever.

Have you got a
crush on bert?

No!

Yes, you do!

No, i don't!

Well, he is
kinda cute.

Well, you should see his room.

If you think dissecting
a frog is gross--

i think it's really brave what he did for your little brother.

All he had to do
was lie there.

But i hear it really hurts when
they stick those needles in you.

It must be really great
to save someone's life.

It was the doctors who
saved darwin's life.

Well, you better
not tell bert

anything about me
thinking he's cute.

Yeah, right.
Like i'm gonna say anything to bert about anything.

Promise?

I promise.

Cross your heart and hope to
die. Stick a needle in your eye.

Grow up, joanne.

Look, i gotta get to
swimming practice,

but i'll see you tomorrow.

Ok.

Oh, are you trying out for
the high school team?

They're all older than i am.

Oh, it doesn't
matter in swimming,

that just means you're
more streamline.

Bye.

Bye.

Are you following me?

Yeah, i'm
talking to you.

You can see me?

Well, yeah.

<i>Strange things were</i>
<i>happening that day.</i>

<i>All over middleburg.</i>

<i>Someone put a little gelatin</i>
<i>in the school swimming pool.</i>

Help!

Hang on! I'll
get you out.

Now, grab onto this.

<i>A colony of bees colonized</i>

<i>the principal's office.</i>

<i>School buses developed</i>
<i>unexplained leaks.</i>

<i>And then there was</i>

<i>the graffiti.</i>

<i>Nobody knew who</i>
<i>was responsible.</i>

<i>Nobody knew who to blame.</i>

Aw, yuk.

Aw, nanook--

aaahhhhhh!

Franny!

Why've you always got to
blame me for everything?

It's called
inductive logic.

Look, if you want everybody
to know you skipped a grade

why don't you just
wear a sign?

Bert?

She's the one that started it.

No one blaming anyone, bert,

for anything.

Of course not.

It's just that studies of
various cultures show

that pranks like these

are usually the work
of adolescents.

You know, i remember
when i was fifteen--

you rolled a yard
with toilet paper.

We were just discussing
whether any of the kids at school

are talking about anything.

You know, like setting
the clocks forward,

or putting something in
the water at the pool.

What happened to
all the gelatin?

Huh?

I was going to make my wiggly
fruit thing for dinner tonight.

Well, i didn't take it.

Well, no one's saying
you did, bert.

Well, if it's not in the cabinet,
then somebody had to take it.

It's the only
logical conclusion.

<i>Parents are always ready to</i>
<i>believe you've done something bad.</i>

What?

<i>It's like they never forget they</i>
<i>had to change your diapers.</i>

<i>But, at least your friends</i>
<i>have more faith in you.</i>

Hi, jo.

How could you do this?

Jo loves bert! You promised!

Jo, i didn't do this.

Get real, francis!

Jo! Joanne!

Forget it!

<i>If i thought it was</i>
<i>strange at home,</i>

<i>school was even stranger.</i>

I'm telling you, she's
the one who did it.

Is there something
interesting about my locker?

Why is yours the only
one without a "b" on it?

Maybe she's the
one who did it.

Grow up, people.

Just because they
skipped my locker

it doesn't mean i had
anything to do with--

see, it is her.

Hey, did you really egg
creepy kepler's car?

Who told you that?

That's what everybody says.

They said you did
the lockers too.

I think that's
really cool.

It's not cool,
it's vandalism.

What does "b" stand for?

You know,
i did not put a "b" on all the lockers!

Well, who did then?

I--

i'm gonna find out.

Aren't ya gonna run
away this time?

I didn't really run away.

Yes. You did!

I just needed some space
to evaluate the situation.

I didn't know you could see me.

Why wouldn't i be
able to see you?

Nobody else can.

Yeah, right.

All right.

Ooohh! Yeaaahh! Ooow!

Well, that's
stealing, you know?

He knows he shouldn't
eat this stuff.

It makes his
face break out.

Well, what's your
name, anyway?

Houdini.

Larry houdini.

Oh, i guess you're almost named after harry houdini?

That-that's really funny.

It's better than being named after <i>francis bacon.</i>

I don't like bacon.

Well--

houdini's not even
a <i>real</i> name.

I'm not a real person.

I'm...

an imaginary friend.

Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!

Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

Well, that's really cute, but i
do not have an imaginary friend.

Did i say i was <i>your</i>
imaginary friend?

I don't think so,
miss francis.

Well,

if you're not my friend,

then why are you
following me around?

Are you sure i'm
following you?

Maybe you're just imagining.

No!

Seriously, fran, do you
mind if i call you fran?

Yeah, actually i do.

I think i must have been
sent here to help you.

That's probably
why you can see me.

Oh, you know, i
don't need any help,

real or imaginary.

Oh, contraire.

There's something very peculiar

going down in this burg, watson.

And it looks to me like...

you're in the middle of it.

Look, i don't care
what they said,

but i did <i>not</i> egg
mr. Kepler's car.

I know you didn't.

Ok.

I know who did.

It was the boogeyman.

The boogeyman?

Um-hmm. And i think he's
got it in for you, fran.

I think you're being...

framed.

Excuse me!

I'm-i'm really sorry.

Umm, does anybody know
who this guy is?

What is she talking about?

He says his name is
larry houdini.

Does anybody know
who he really is?

<i>Francis mccausland.</i>
<i>To the office please.</i>

<i>Francis mccausland.</i>
<i>To the office.</i>

I see your middle name is bacon.

That is bacon with
a "b", correct?

Is there a bacon without a "b"?

Francis, it has been suggested

that you might know something

about the unusual events
that have been happening

the past few days.

We have reason to
believe there was a plan

among a large
number of students

to set clocks to
the wrong time

as a sort of mass prank.

<i>You</i> had that list of students you were checking with

to make sure they set their clocks forward.

What?

Back.
You set them <i>back</i> to make the alarms go off earlier.

You set them forward.

It's like daylight savings time.

Fall back.
Spring forward.

No. Fall forwards.
Spring back.

Can we forget
about the clocks...

for a moment?

Spring forward.

Francis, do you
have any knowledge

about mr. Kepler's car
being vandalized?

No!

Or about the graffiti
on the lockers?

No!

Don't forget the gelatin
in the swimming pool.

No!

How do you
feel, francis,

about all
these things?

Do you have
any insights?

Yes. Yes, actually i do.

There's this boy...

and he's been
following me around.

Well, he's really weird.

He said his name
was larry houdini.

Well, he said a lot
of silly things.

Did he say he knew who
was behind the pranks?

Well, actually--

well, there he is!
He's right there!

Hey!

Come here, you!

Francis.

Francis!

Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya!

Hey! You! Come here!

Houdini kid, come here!

Hey! What's
with her?

Come back here!

Quick! In here!

Get in the bass drum.

As a hiding place,
you can't beat it!

I'm not trying to
hide. I'm chasing you.

Fran, fran, fran.

You're making a
big mistake, fran.

And i was really sent
here to help you.

Yeah, who sent you?

Do you ever hear a little
voice inside you head,

telling you you
should do something?

Actually, no.

Well, i did. And <i>he</i> told me

to come to beautiful
downtown middleburg.

What you heard was
just disassociation

between the two
sides of your...

alleged brain.

No, no, no. It's
the same guy

that sings those stupid songs
you can't get out of your head.

No. That's
barry manilow.

Francis!

In here!

He's in here!

See you get out of
this one, houdini.

Fran, fran, fran.

There he is. Larry houdini.

I think this joke has gone on long enough, francis.

What are you
talking about?

He's right here. He's
playing a saxophone.

He's moon-walking.

I'm going to have to
call your parents.

Why are you doing
this to me?

Why are you pretending
that you can't--

see him?

Would you like to
lie down, francis?

Francis?

Francis! Oh!

Would you say that francis
is unusually rebellious?

Oh, no. Not at all.

Francis has always been
very mature for her age.

Very, very
well adjusted.

Very grown up.

Starting high school
can be traumatic.

Especially if she
skipped a grade.

I understand that her younger
brother had leukemia.

And it says here
that he was given

bone marrow transplants
from his sibling.

Well, yes. That's true.

Ah, but darwin is in remission.

The doctors say there's every
hope for a complete cure.

Oh.

I've been developing
a theory

that francis is acting out,

oh, repressed anger at having
to donate her bone marrow

to save her brother.

Well, that's interesting.

However it was our elder son,

bert, albert,

who was the donor.

So...?

Well, it was
just a theory.

I see.

Oh.

Can franny come out to play?

Aaahhhh!

Francis!

How do you
feel, francis?

Ok.

I guess.

Oh, i am sure that there
is a logical explanation

for everything that's
been going on.

I know that you are
far too mature

to be playing childish
pranks on people.

And you still think it
was this boy, larry,

who put the gelatin in
the swimming pool,

and threw the eggs
on mr. Kepler's car?

Eggs?

I'm sure it is all simply a
misunderstanding, honey,

but francis, i was just
thinking about something

ms. Readle said.

You know, about
repressed anger.

Oh, mom, no!

Is there anything your father and i could possibly--

please, please let's not
get freudian, ok?

This is not some
kind of adolescent--

thing.

Well, honey...?

I didn't do it!

She ran into her room like she
was still just a little child.

Oh, what if she's not emotionally
mature enough to start high school?

Oh, come on.
We have thought all the way through this.

I know, but what if
we made a mistake?

Well, maybe she's
unhappy, michael.

Maybe she's blaming us.

Oh! Oh!
So you think our daughter

is expressing her
resentment towards us

by writing the letter "b"
all through the town.

Let's be the adults
here, michael, shall we?

No. I mean, obviously she's
not doing everything alone.

Well, obviously.

But if she is unhappy,

that could make her vulnerable,

and maybe she got involved in...

some kind of--oh, i
don't know, some--

mind control.

You know, she mentioned
being hypnotized

in the car on the way home.

And there are incidents of mass hypnosis

that have occurred
all over the world.

What <i>if</i>

someone is controlling
the minds of children

all over middleburg?

Telling them to egg cars,
and set clocks back--

so you're saying that someone
is coming into this house

to control our
children's minds?

How could
they do that?

<i>So remember, my friends, when</i>
<i>you are ready to make--</i>

we are having an important discussion here, bert!

About francis.

What?
You guys think she's the one doing all that stuff?

That's what everybody
at school says.

She's supposed to be, like,
the ringleader or something.

To break this accursed
spell, hmm?

Be mass hypnosis.otta

be mass hypnosis.otta

it's the only
possible explanation.

Aaaah!

Darwin!

Are you sure there isn't
really a boogyman?

What?

Some kids at the
park said there is.

But if you pull the covers
over your head at night,

the boogeyman
can't get you.

Darwin, the boogeyman
is just something

that somebody made
up to scare children.

You know, somebody older and wiser
needs to tell those kids the truth.

It was a big boy who told
them about the boogeyman.

Well, he should be ashamed for
scaring children like that.

They said his name was larry.

Hey! Hey, darwin!

What did he
look like?

The guy who told them
about the boogeyman.

I don't know. They said he
was playing basketball.

But i couldn't see him.

Come on. Give
me the ball.

Give me the ball!
Give me the ball!

Wooowwww!

Woooowwwowww!

And he scores!

Hyyyeeee ya!

Woowooooo!

You missed the shot.

What are you? The referee?

Games over,
larry houdini.

Are you mad
about somethin'?

Yeah! Actually
i'm furious!

You had me thinkin' i was
seeing things, or something.

For telling me you're some
kind of imaginary person.

Fran! Get it right.

Well, all you really
did was just hypnotize

the principal
and ms. Readle

to make them think that
they couldn't see you.

What?

Yeah.

Girl! I don't know how
to hypnotize people.

I can do a magic trick.

Here you go, fran.

You know, if you're not
for real then why--

why could the kids
in the park see you?

Those were little
kids, fran.

They can see
anything they want.

Just like i see
these monkey bars.

You know, i want you
to tell my parents,

and the principal,

and ms. Readle...

are you listening to me?

Larry?

They can't see me, fran. Ok?

[Continues making
monkey noises Ã±

are you the one who's been
causing' all the weird stuff

that's happening around here?

Yeah, like the graffiti,
and the vandalism,

and the dogs?

Why are you doing
this to me?

I told you.

The guy in my head.
He sent me here.

You don't listen.

I get it. I get it.
You're trying to get me into trouble.

You're trying to blame
everything on me.

Shhhhh.

What?
Shhhhhh.

What?

Can you hear 'em?

No! I don't hear voices!

I just see things.

Have you seen this one yet?

Check it out, fran.
Pretty cool, huh?

Weeeeee!

Ahh.

Do you have a
library card?

What?

"The pirates have
captured them, they said.

"The pirates have captured them!

"Peter excitedly snatched up his
sword, ready and eager for--

hey! What's up, guys?

Hey, you and you and you!

Taking care of that lizard?

How's that lizard?

"But suddenly, he
remembered wendy's caution:

"not to forget his medicine.

"Tinkerbell saw peter as
he lifted the cup.

Where's the book?
Where's the book?

Ohh, which book? Which book?

You know, there is such a
thing as a card catalog?

Ssshhhpp!

"Tinkerbell flew between
peter and the medicine,

and as he lifted it--"

you look up the title
of the book you want?

I don't know what book i want.

Guy in my head just
said i needed a book.

He didn't say which one.

Ssshhhpp! The librarian.

Why is it so
bright in here?

Some people, they
like to read in here.

Go figure.

What's with
your eyes?

Ok. It's not that
bright in here.

Eureka!

"Do you believe in
fairies? Do you?

The librarian is going to throw
us out if you don't be quiet!

"There came an echo of sound--

le livre de boogey!

The boogey book?

By who?

By guy n. Head.

No!
If this is supposed to convince me that you're for real--

you mean <i>not</i> for real.

Read the dedication.

This book is dedicated to--

larry.

Ha ha. To larry. Ok.

So let's see what the
head honcho has to say.

Head. Honcho.

No! No! This doesn't
prove anything.

Ssshhhhpp!

There are places where you can
have a phoney book printed.

"Do you believe?

Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

"If you believe, then
clap your hands.

"Save poor tinkerbell. Clap your
hands as hard as you can!

Sssshhhhhppp!

Uh-oh.

Quiet!

"...the sound of millions
of little hands clapping.

Hold my book.

"Of course, they
believed in fairies.

Hey! How you doing?

Are you all daa daa daa?

Boom!

He's magic.

â™ª If you're larry and you
know it, clap your hands â™ª

â™ª imaginary and you know
it, clap your hands â™ª

â™ª if the boogeyman is scarey â™ª

â™ª then just ask help
from larry â™ª

â™ª if you need me and you know
it, clap your hands â™ªâ™ª

what the--

yah!

All right!

Sshhhhhpp!
Ssssshhhhhp!

Ssshhhhhpp!
Sssshhhhhhhhpp!

Ssshhhhhp!

Ssshhhp! Sshhhhp!

Ssshhhhp! Ssshhhhhpp!

Ssshhhp! Ssshhhhp!
Ssshhhpp! Ssshhhhpp!

Hooooo! Hoooooooooo!

Who turned off story time?

He did.

He did.

Do not touch the audio
visual equipment.

Here's larry.

So, who wants to
hear the story...

...about the boogeyman?

Oh, i'm getting scared
just thinking about it.

Oh, hi, francis. How you doin'?

Anyway,

the boogeyman is a very bad man.

So, if he ever tries to
come into your home,

at night, into your room,

make sure you pull the
covers over your head.

That way he can't get you.

I think i'd like
to check this out.

Oh! This is it!
This is it!

Chapter two. Fifty ways
to bust your boogey.

You know, you could
be an astronaut

from a galaxy
far, far away.

And you've got this neural thing in your head

that keeps people
from seeing you.

Ok.
Although it doesn't work on really small children.

You know, what if that
voice in your head,

what if it's some
kind of transmission

from a mother ship?

Man, if we had a
thermo-nuclear device

that boogeyman
would be toast!

No! What if
the boogeyman

was really a creature from a distant planet?

He comes from
under your bed.

What?

It says it right here.

The boogeyman lives
under your bed.

It doesn't say
which bed,

but i figure if he's trying to ruin your life,

it must be
under <i>your</i> bed.

Well, there's nothing living under my bed.

Oh, yeah, francis?

Yeah.

Have you
looked lately?

Well, let's just go look right now.

All righty,
then.

Ok.

Well, are you coming or--

what?

Where have you
been, francis?

Don't, michael.

I just went to
the library.

You know you're not supposed
to go out without telling us first.

Ok. I'm sorry.
I guess i forgot.

It's all
right, francis.

We're not angry.
We're just very worried about you.

Can i go to
my room now?

Actually, we need
to talk, francis.

Yes, you may go.

But just keep us informed next time, ok?

Ok.

Don't you want to know what's going on with her?

Well, of course i do!

But we can't pressure
her, michael.

She needs her space.

She needs
professional help!

Sshhhh!

I am going to e-mail
that guidance counselor,

ms. Readle.

I'm going to invite her
over to dinner tomorrow.

She has experience
dealing with

problems like this.

Besides, i have that
roast i need to cook.

Hey!

Larry!

He's not under there...

...now.

Ok. It says here there's
this thing called temporalfuge

that can make a
boogeyman harmless.

You've got your
feet on my bed!

Aw, man!
I think i can make one of these temporalfuge things.

Where do you get
your clothes?

Well, i swear, it's got the
instructions and everything!

Look at this!

Have you lost your marbles?

Darwin?

Found 'em on the floor.
They're not bert's.

Hey, man! Don't you
recognize me?

How do you
know darwin?

He said they
weren't his.

It's me!

Larry?

Are they yours?

Do you see anybody else in here?

You don't have to
be snotty about it.

I don't want your ol'
marbles, anyway.

Oh, wait. Don't leave, darwin.
Darwin?

Darwin? Why won't you be
my friend anymore?

You were darwin's
imaginary friend?

I didn't know that
was your brother.

Darwin, pull the
covers over your head,

so you'll be safe. Ok?

He doesn't even
know i exist!

Well, he doesn't believe in things like imaginary friends.

I can't believe i'm
having this conversation.

You're not really an
imaginary friend.

I don't understand why he
doesn't believe in me anymore.

Oh, well, look. I told
him a long time ago

that it was childish to
believe in things like that.

You did it.

You're the reason
why he can't see me!

You told darwin to
stop believing in me.

What's wrong
with your eyes?

I must be allergic to
something. I don't know.

Allergies don't make
your eyes look like that.

You know what, fran, you just
know everything. Don't you?

That's why--that's why you told
darwin to stop believing in me.

To show him you knew
more than he did.

No! He needs to believe in his doctors.
Ok?

Something real.

That's how you
stop being afraid.

You grow up and...

face reality.

And i had to
help him do that.

You wanted to help him?

Then why didn't you give him
some of your bone marrow? Huh?

I wanted to help him
but the doctors said

bert was the only
one who could do it.

I bet that was a relief.

No! I wanted to do it!

Safe!

Larry?

No! Don't pretend with me, fran!

I know all about pretending.

Larry?

Heh, heh, heh, heh, heehhhh.

Fran?

The boogeyman
is on the roof.

A fireman now?

You remind me of
darwin's action figures.

Well, i don't
see anybody.

Just all these
christmas lights.

There is no boogeyman
on the roof. Ok?

I think you're making
the whole thing up.

Hold this for me.
I'm going up.

Wait. Wait. What are
you going to do?

I don't know.

Ok? I don't know.

I guess i'll use
my imagination.

Try using a ladder. Ok?

There's one in
the garage.

Larry?

Larry?

Larry?

Larry?!

Ssshhhhh!

Larry?

Larry?

Rah!

Ha ha ha ha ha haaaa!

Got you!

Aaaahhhh!

Ha ha ha ha!

Aaahhhhh!

Whoooooa!

It's nice of you
to hang around,

but you'd be safer
on the ground.

Whooo whooo whooo ha ha haaa!

Oh, eyes are
kinda scarey.

Don't ya think
so, larry?

Do you see him, fran?!

Franny.

It won't be long
until she can see

a boogey just like me.

Larry?

Do you see him, fran?!

Do you see him?!

And you'll see that
you boogey too.

Inside of the mirror,

it's you.

Fran!

Whoa!

Whooaaa!

Aaahhhh!

Aaahhhhh!

What was that?

Ohhh!

Look around and you will see

that blackout starts with "b".

What's this?

What's with
the lights?

Francis?

What?

Please.

Ahh, ahhh...

what?

Ahhh... aahhh...

hey, mike!
What's up with this?

There he is!

Mr. Mccausland?
Mr. Mccausland?!

Wwhooaaaa!

Why was your house the only
one with power in the city?

Can you make a
statement, sir?

Is this a political statement?

We need to talk about this.

Could we not discuss
current events

this morning, michael?

I am talking
about this!

This is our house on the front page of the paper!

We've got tv reporters outside right now!

Ah, cool!

Hello?

Francis?

You know we are not
trying to pressure you,

but even you must admit

that you have not adequately
explained what you where doing

with that ladder last night.

Francis?

This has nothing to do with
the public right to know!

Francis? Are we
communicating?

Nope!

What, mom?

A chick from channel 15
news is out there.

Oh, she's a hotty.

If you want to know
about our family,

visit our web site.

Maybe we ought to get
away from the house.

Why don't we take
a family drive?

Aw, gee, i would
love that...

but i've got this
elective dental surgery.

Listen, bert--

and i don't feel good.
Can i stay home too?

After what you were up to
last night, young lady--

just... michael.

Whooo!

Time flies.

Ha! Nice catch.

You're all right?

Just <i>all right?</i>

And i thought i
was great! Ha!

When you fell off
the roof last night,

i thought
that you were...

get real,
francis.

If i can quote your
friend, joanne.

Well, former friend.
Thanks to the boogeyman.

Are you sure you didn't do anything to make him mad?

Hello? I think
i'd remember

if i'd ever done anything to the boogeyman.

Ok, francis. Ok.

Are you saying because
you're imaginary

that you can't
ever die?

I never asked!

Well, so, what, you
never get old?

You just stay young forever,
like... peter pan?

Our friends grow
up, then...

they don't need
us anymore.

So we go find
new friends.

Makin' new friends
keeps you young.

Just like aerobics.

Tae bo. Tai chi.
All that good stuff!

Well, then why didn't
you get a new friend

when darwin stopped
believing in you?

Because darwin

still needed me.

Well...

what is this thing anyway?

Temporalfuge.

Ohhh.

How does it work?

Assuming it works.

Oh, it's so simple, a
child could understand it.

In fact, a grown-up couldn't
understand it at all.

All right. If you
spin the clock

clockwise at the right rpm,

it creates, what you call a
temporal fugitation impulse.

You take the fugitation
impulse and

you amplify it with
magnetic fields,

and then the speaker sends it
through the vacuum chamber.

Well, that's dad's
vacuum cleaner!

Your dad does
the vacuuming?

Yeah, he likes to
do the house work.

This is starting to
get unbelievable.

Anyways, after resonating
the vacuum chamber,

the impulses go through
these jumper cables

and right into the boogeyman.

And?

A boogeyman has got a very
tightly wound biological clock.

That's why they only bother you
when you're a little kid.

By the time you grow up,

the boogeyman is
tired and retired.

No, no. Then why is
he bothering me now?

That's a very good
question, fran.

Anywho, the temporalfuge
speeds it up.

Thirty seconds on this baby,
he's got a white, long beard,

walking with a cane,
eating some prunes.

He's harmless. Too
old to boogey.

You expect me to
believe all this?

It's in the book.

What do you want, a
demonstration?

Yeah.

Stay back.

It's still experimental.

I would've said
ridiculous.

I'm going to
pull the switch.

They said i was crazy
at the university.

It's alive!

But now i've showed them.

Now they'll see
who has the last laugh.

Ha ha!

Ha ha ha!

Oooh!

It's not funny!

Sorry.

You know, this stuff
smells disgusting.

It's sour.

It's been fugitated. It's
like two months old now.

I don't know why i went
kablooey like that.

The temporalfuge must be
lactose intolerant or something.

Oouch! You scratched me!

Give me that!

I used to bite them.

Uh-hmm, so that's why they grow really fast now.

Man, there is something
strange going on with you.

Like, how would
you know?

Have you known any other imaginary people?

I could be
perfectly normal.

Ha! Yeah, right.

And pigs
could fly.

Look, i'm gonna go
take a cold shower.

Maybe that'll wake me
up from this nightmare.

Ooh, is that a zit?

Girl, you need to take care of your skin.

Great. I'm still dreaming.

Over here.

What are you doing in there?

Just pausing
to reflect.

Get out! Ok? Get out!

It's creepy.

Oh.

There.

How long have you been in there?

I was just thinking,

now that the boogeyman
knows we're after him,

he may not come out
from under the bed

for who knows
how long.

You know.
Lay low.

Why can't we just wait for him to come out?

What's the hurry?

Oh, no. No.
There's no hurry

i just thought it'd be
nice to get it over with.

You know, before
something bad happens.

Bad?

I mean if it does.

So how do we get this over with?

It's all in
the book.

This is what's to be
called, "boogey goo."

Boogey goo.

Boogeymen love
this stuff.

It's gonna take me a while to get the ingredients, but...

why don't you try
the supermarket?

Imaginary food
section.

That's a good idea.

Fran, you are so smart.

Ap...

a spell or a..."

you di

a spell or a..."

you didn't say charm.
I know that.

That's a lovely little
bust you have there.

Ohhh, yes.

Thank you.

It's a reproduction, of course.

You know, you don't get rich
being a cultural anthropologist.

Oh, tell me about it.

And what do you
do, michael?

I've got a phd in solid
waste engineering.

Piled higher
and deeper.

Ha ha ha ha!

It's so caring of you to invite me
into your home environment,

and give francis
and i a chance

to get to
know each other.

Francis and <i>me.</i>

Uh-huh.

Can i be excused?

Yes. Of course you may, francis.

I'm gonna to go to
my room environment.

What are you doing?

Oooh!

Ooh! That smells
so disgusting!

It's boogey goo!

Oh, yeah.
Boogey goo.

You need to clean this up

before somebody comes in
here and sees all this.

I think it's about done, anyway.

What's in that?

Hee hee hee hee!

It's so good! It's so
good! It's so good!

Some rotten eggs,
burnt sugar,

jalapeÃ±o peppers,
limburger cheese,

some anchovies,
bacon grease,

ah, one of
those guys.

And your...

daily requirement of iron.

A couple of slugs,

some leftovers from
the school cafeteria.

Ha ha ha ha ha!

Aahh!

Sick!

Yeah!

Don't you hate leftovers?

Oh, and i needed
some week-old sweat,

so i ran one of bert's gym
socks through the blender.

Well, you did wash it out when
you were done, didn't you?

Say what?

You did wash it out--

this is expensive.

Pudding, ms. Readle?

Oh, thank you.

It looks delicious.

Excuse me. I think i smell
something... strange.

We can pour a trail
of boogey goo,

and lead the boogeyman straight into the temporalfuge.

Ooh!

Francis?

Why? And what in the
world are you cooking?

It's... uh...

homework.

For home ec.

You are not taking
home... ec.

That's why i'm
cooking it at home.

I think everyone should
learn how to cook.

This doesn't not smell
like food, francis.

You're right. I'm
gonna take it out.

Ok. I think it's about time

we started telling each
other the truth, young lady.

Now, mom?

Yes. Now.

Francis, your father
and i both know

that something is
going on with you,

and that you are
involved somehow

with what's going
on in middleburg.

Mom--

we don't want to punish
you, francis--

can we move?

We just want to understand
why you are doing it.

I can't help but feel
that your father and i

are partially
responsible.

That maybe we forced you
to grow up too fast.

This has a very
interesting flavor.

Do i detect a
hint of nutmeg?

Just a little bit.

That looks like
bert's gym sock.

Oh!

I know what we went
through with darwin

must've been very
hard for you.

We almost lost him, and
that was very scary.

Even for the grown-ups--

what kind of cookbook is this, honey,
because i'm just a little--

karen!

Now, don't go, 'cause
we gotta start now.

I'll be back.

Karen,
honey!

Karen, need a
little help!

Larry?

Larry?

Uuh!

Larry?

Uuh, uuh.

What are you
doing in there?

I got hungry.

Get out. Get out!

Can you help me?

Can you help me?

How can you eat
that stuff?

It kinda taste
like chicken,

with a... with a hint of...

of nutmeg!

Yeah.

What is going on
with you, larry?

First, your eyes...

your fingernails...

now you're eating
boogey goo.

Look. I'm not...

turning into a
boogeyman, ok?

You got that?

Don't go there!

Don't go there, francis!

Larry?

Just keep taking deep
breaths, ms. Readle.

Ok.

I'm going to get some
anti-nausea medicine.

And a waste basket.

May i be excused?

I hate seeing
people barf.

You are turning into a
boogeyman, aren't you?

What makes you say that?

Where do boogeymen
come from, larry?

Is it in the book?

"If a child stops believing in
an imaginary friend too soon,

the imaginary friend... may
turn into a boogeyman."

That's what's happening
to you, isn't it?

Because i made darwin stop
believing in you too soon.

Larry, i'm trying to help you.

Just go away, ok?
You can't help me.

Don't say i can't help, ok?!

That's a terrible
thing to say.

Who are you talking to?

Darwin, i'm trying to have a private conversation here.

Does that mean you're
talking to yourself?

Will you just please leave
me alone for a little while?

It's my room.

Please?

Ok, but then i
get your room.

Would you give this
to darwin for me?

He's looking all
over for it.

Maybe you could give
it to him yourself.

Or maybe i could
talk to darwin

and i could get him to
believe in you again.

It's a little late
for that, fran.

Larry?

Oh, there you are.

Nestor here is a diver.

You can go for
rides on his back.

He might even give you
swimming lessons.

Do you smell something?

Hey. How are you doing?

Now, watch.

Boogey goo!

Stop it, larry! Ok?
That's disgusting!

Ha ha ha! He he!

Boogey goo! I think i must've
spilled it on the kitchen floor.

And you stepped in it.

I didn't step in any
boogey goo, ok?!

Then how did it
get up here?

Darwin!
Darwin!

Now watch me dive.

Aaaahhhhh!

Darwin?

Darwin?!

Why are you breathing like that?

There's something in my--

there's something in my throat.

He must be downstairs.

Oh! That's awful!

What did you expect?

The boogeyman licked
the shoe! Blaaa!

Are you telling me that the
boogeyman's got darwin?

It must be after his sole.

It's got boogey goo on it.

I looked under the bed, and
darwin is not under there.

No, no, no, no.
He's under there,

you just can't see him.

Darwin's in the
boogey world, now.

I'm gonna go get my
temporalfuge, all right?

Boogey world?

No. No, no, no.
Yes.

Now you have gone too...

far.

Ok, i refuse to believe
in some invisible place

called the boogey world.

C'mon, fran. You believe in
the boogeyman, don't you?

I haven't seen him.

You didn't see him on
the roof last night?

All i saw was you and a
lot of blinky lights.

Besides, it's hard to believe in something you can't see.

You mean like electricity.

Oh, come on.

Atoms, molecules,

gravity.

Ok, ok.

If there was a...

boogey world,

how do we get
into it?

<i>We</i> don't.

This job is for a
professional.

Look, i am not going to sit
up here and do nothing, ok?

You have no idea
how hard it was

when darwin was sick and i
couldn't do anthing--

and you told him he should
stop believing in me!

You were a big
help then, fran.

Why are you
being so mean?

What do you expect?!

I'm turning into a
boogeyman, ok?!

Ok, francis?

I'm going with you.

What if i boogey down the rest
of the way while you're in there?

You may get trapped in boogey
world, just like darwin.

I'm not worried about
what happens to me.

I am! Ok? I am.

Larry...

what?!

What you said about me being
relieved when i couldn't be a donor...

it's true.

I was glad it
had to be bert,

because i was scared.

Real people get
scared, fran.

It's perfectly logical.

Aaah!

Oh, i hate that
stupid thing!

Aaah!

Please do not do
that, dad?!

Francis, did you put a
gym sock in the blender?

Dad, i'm kinda in the middle of something right now.

Well, it's just going
to have to wait,

because i am not
leaving here

until i hear the truth
about everything.

Ok.

It was...

the boogeyman.

Ok? The boogeyman.

You know, and he's got darwin
under the bed, right now.

And he has been the
cause of everything

that has been
happening around here.

Maybe you would be more comfortable
speaking with your mother about this.

Sure.

Bye.

Larry! Larry!

Larry!

You know what? I had a feeling
you were following me.

Especially when you
started yanking my cord.

Where are we?

Under your bed, sort of.

You believe in the
boogey world now?

This isn't happening.

It's so big.

Imagine if you had a
queen-size bed. Whooo!

Now that's big.

How am i gonna find
darwin in this?

Well, we can walk

or take the car.

Is that darwin's toy car?

Yeah.
You should've seen me trying to get it out of my pocket.

Whooo!

Do you think that the
boogeyman would hurt darwin?

Oh, no, no, no, no.

You're the one he's after.

I figure darwin's just the bait
to get you under the bed.

So you better watch your back,

your front, your sides, your right, your left,
and-- whoo-hoo! Over your head!

Look out!

Stop! Stop!

Is that the boogeyman?
Is that the boogeyman?

No. This is a
peanut-butter sandwich.

Why is the boogeyman
after me?

Why doesn't he just
leave me alone?

Did you ever have an
imaginary friend?

No. Never.

Maybe it's just a
boogey thing.

So sick!

Ok, we gotta push the
car to get it started.

Ah, hello?
Why don't you use the jumper cables on your back?

Jumper cables only
work on real cars.

We're gonna have to
push it backwards.

I bet you only had
educational toys.

C'mon. Let's just
find darwin.

C'mon, fran, put
your back into it.

I am.

Get on. Get on.

Hurry. Hurry,
it's slipping.

Oooh!

Turn left! Turn left!

Larry! Aaaah!

Turn right! Right, right!

What is going on?

You don't even
know how to drive!

Watch out! Watch out!

Aaaaaahhh!

Oh, there's nothing like
the wind in your hair!

Woo hoo hoo!

Larry!

Let go of the cord!

Aaaah!

Look out!

Look out, fran!

Fran?

Fran, are you ok?

I bit my lip.

Francis!

Where am i, francis?

Francis!

Darwin! Darwin!

Oooh!

It smells like a
dirty sock in here!

Don't worr darwin!
I'm gonna get you out.

Help me!

Ooh!

I remember when i couldn't
even get these on you.

Ha ha ha.

Uh, fran!

Francis!

Larry.

Turn it up, quick!
He's right behind you!

Bowling for boogies.

Come on.

Strike! Yeah!

Help!

Larry! Larry, it's him!

It's temporalfuge time!

What? Are you trying
to start something?

Yeah.

You.

Aah!

Say goodbye.

No!

Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!

Ha ha ha ha!

Aaaaaahhhh!

Got ya.

Huh?

What's wrong?

Your extension cord

has come uncurled.

And now you're powerless

in boogey world.

Don't worry, larry.

I won't hurt you.

It's lots more fun

to just convert you.

Help!

I'm not a boogeyman, yet.

There's still time
to bust you!

Huh?

Noooo!

Larry, are you ok?

Who are you talking
to, francis?

Darwin!

It's coiled around me!

Larry!

Francis...

larry?

Do you think i look
a little strange?

But when you grow up,

sometimes you change!

Larry...

francis.

Larry, you have
to fight this.

Come, francis.

Fight what?

Larry!

Come, let's play, francis.

Francis?

Aaaaahhh!

Ooooh-ahhhh!

Aaaah!

Larry, you don't have
to be a boogeyman!

You said there's
no such thing.

Franny, franny, franny.

Franny?

Stash franny in
someplace or other,

while i get a wig off
her little brother.

Haaa!

Larry, you have to help
him! He needs you!

I'm scared!

If darwin wanted
me to care,

he should have asked
for help from larry.

Get me out, francis!

I'm scared!

Did that hurt?

Oh, i'm sorry.

Darwin, ask larry for help!

Remember your
friend, larry?

He's not real. You told me.

You said we have
to be grown up.

Ha! It's scary to take
such a long, long drop.

Francis!

But even scarier
when you stop.

I was wrong! I was just afraid!

Darwin, i didn't
know what to do,

and i thought that if i was
grown up, i could do anything.

Ha! You don't get second
chances to be young.

Darwin! Darwin!

So, you won't
answer, franny?

Francis!

Hold your tongue!

Darwin! Darwin,
can you hear me?

Hey, darwin, if you still believe in larry,
clap your hands, ok?

That's all you have
to do, just clap!

Shut up! Stop it!

That's it! Come on, clap!

Stop it!

Larry, i need you!
Help me, please!

Larry!

That's it, darwin!

Larry, i
need you!

Aaaaaaah!

I still believe! Larry!

I'm back!

And you're busted!

The temporalfuge! You've got
to plug it in to something!

Hey! Cut it out!

C'mon, you guys!

That's my friend in
there, you scaggy creep!

Stop! Stop!
Who's pulling me?

What's going on?!

You're not gonna
hurt my pal!

There's no way, man!
All right?

Francis! Where are
you, francis?!

Oh.

Ooh!

Oow! My foot!

Francis!

C'mon, you guys!

If you think you
can win,

you're wrong.

Aaah!

Larry!

That boogeyman is
really strong.

I hate to be the
one to tell you,

but it's not too late
for me to nail you.

Ah ha ha!

Aah!

You know, i think i'm
gonna be staying alive,

'cause you can't catch
up with this jive.

Ha ha! Whoo!
And what? And what?

Uh-oh!

Yaaaa!

Uuuh.

Darwin!

I'm ok, but i'm
not happy!

The pen is mightier
than the sword.

The pen is mightier
than two swords.

Aah!

Of course it's no match
for a fingernail.

Ok!

I gotcha now.

Huh?

Don't do it!

Don't do it!

Use 'em, fran!

Aaaaaahhhhhh!

Franny, no!

Franny, wait!

Franny?

Ooh! I'm getting old.

I'm getting so old,

i've even forgotten how
to rhyme anymore.

Oh, please.

Please, please,
franny, franny.

Oooooh!

Aaahhh! Aaah!

Aaaah!

Your temporalfuge,
it didn't work.

Now i'll get you

and this imaginary jerk!

I'm not afraid of you!

I beg your pardon?

I'm not afraid of you!

I know who you are.

You can't scare me.

Really? Yaaaaaa!

Francis!

Stop it, zoe!

Zoe? Who's zoe?

Only one person ever
called me franny.

It was hard for me to
admit it was you.

I didn't want it
to be my fault.

I'm sorry, zoe.

No!

Francis!

Zoe.

The boogeyman, a girl?

Get outta here! What
you doing a girl?

Larry! I thought
it was you!

Long time no see, huh?

Hey, remember your car?

Are you ok, darwin?

I'm got sock fuzz
in my mouth.

Francis?

Are you ok, francis? We
heard a strange noise.

Uh... i...

was vacuuming
under the bed.

You didn't change
the bag first.

Encouragement, michael, encouragement.

Francis, honey, we came
upstairs to apologize.

You father just logged
onto the internet news.

The same things that
were going on here,

just started happening
last night in centerville.

They think the same
people are responsible

but most important,

we know that you are
not responsible.

Oh, sweetheart,

we are so sorry that we
didn't believe you.

It's ok. It's ok, mom.

You were just looking for
a logical explanation.

It was the boogeyman.

Oh, please.

Darwin, you know there's no
such thing as the boogeyman.

Yeah, but i saw him,

with big, sharp
teeth and claws!

Darwin, it's past
your bedtime.

You tell 'em, darwin.

You won't go
away, will you?

Well, of course she won't go away, honey.

She's your sister.

I'll be here whenever
you need me.

That's what
friends are for.

I'm glad i do believe
in you again.

I believe in you
too, francis.

Yes, honey,
we all do.

Goodnight, sweetheart.

Goodnight.

So what's the story on
the boogeyman here?

Actually, it's
boogey person.

Yeah? So who are you?

Personally?

This is zoe.

Zoe's my imaginary friend.

You told me you never had an imaginary friend.

She lied.

Wise up, lar.

Just because you hang around
with a seven-year-old,

doesn't mean you
have to be naive.

Zoe and i used to play all the time when i was little.

When darwin got sick,
and we couldn't do anything to make him better,

that's when i decided
i had to grow up.

I just stopped believing
in what wasn't real.

And you started to turn
into a boogeyman?

Boogey person.

I'm so sorry i stopped
believing in you, zoe.

Shhh.

The guy inside his head.

That explains the echo.

On my way, big guy.

Gotta go, fran.

Go where?
Centerville.

You heard what
your dad said

about the weird things
going on over there.

They've got a boogeyman
who needs busting.

I'd better go with you.

I've seen you in
action, lar,

and i don't think you could handle
a full-tilt boogey by yourself.

You know what? I think
i liked you better

when you were a boogey--

person.

[Mumbling Ã±

oh, it was wonderful to
see you again, franny.

I'm sorry for all the
trouble i caused.

I didn't want to
be a boogey.

I just couldn't
help it.

It's ok. Everything's
all right,

and we can be friends
again, just like before.

You won't be seeing
us anymore, franny.

Well, you told darwin
you wouldn't go away.

She means we won't be
coming back to see you.

Oh, no, no.

Only real friends
last forever.

Like joanne.

But i believe in you.

I believe in both of you.

The time to believe is when you're little,
like darwin.

When you still need us.

I don't want to
lose you again.

You won't lose
me, franny.

Not as long as
you remember me.

Fess up, fran?

You know you're too grown up
to have an imaginary friend.

Don't you?

Well, no.

I mean i can see you
guys right now,

and that proves,
logically, that--

excuse me.

You're not turning into
a boogeyman, anymore.

You don't need
sunglasses.

Yeah. But they
make me look cool.

Hey, fran...

maybe i am too grown up.

Ah, fran...

just because you're
getting older,

doesn't mean you
have to get old.

I can't sleep.
I'm kinda scared.

Climb in.

You know, the only way the
boogeyman can hurt you

is by making you afraid.

Yeah.

Francis...

uh-huh.

I'm not really scared
of the boogeyman.

And i saw how
you handled him.

I'm worried about
getting sick again.

Have you talked to
larry about it?

He said you
could help me.

That you could tell me how
grown-ups keep from being scared.

Well, i guess they know that
being afraid doesn't help.

Also, they don't
like being afraid.

It makes them
act afraid.

Kinda like pretending
you're not scared.

Yeah, i guess.

And pretty soon, you're
not afraid anymore.

I guess it takes a
lot of imagination

to become a
grown-up.

It sure does, sweetie.
