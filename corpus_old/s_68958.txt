Keep to the centre channel!

We must stick together!

If you damage that package,
you won't get paid!


Ah!

Save the package!

(DOOR OPENS)

Duke of Northampton. Accident during
a motoring holiday. Fatal, sadly.

2,000 words by five o'clock, Mr Malone.

Oh...!

Mr McArdle? The decapitation in Hackney.
I know the area well.

Could I cover it?
Arkwright's on it.

What about the Whitechapel opium dens?
I thought maybe I could go under cover.

Maybe write about the white slave trade.
You read too much trash.

I've been on obituaries
for over a year. Give me a chance!

What do you know about dinosaurs?
Not much.

I'm attending a lecture tonight
at the Natural History Museum.

You can come and write it up.
Gladys told me of this.

She's my girl. Her father arranged the
evening. He's high up in the Royal Society.

If I like it, I might put you on the next murder.

Thank you very much.
I still need 2,000 words on the Duke!

Sorry I'm late. The Duke had a full life.

Edward, you do talk in riddles.
Good evening, Professor Illingworth.

We'd better go in. I detest
missing the beginning of a lecture.

something. Summerlee's a good man.

Not an original mind, of course,
but solid, very solid.

Edward. You mustn't!

You shouldn't be so pretty. Have you
thought any more about our conversation?

Which one? There are so many.
You know which one.

Gladys, I DO have prospects.
Look, it's Lord Roxton!

He's just come back from Africa.
Hunting elephants and tigers.

Actually, tigers come from India.
Pedantry is not a virtue, Edward.

Will you be returning to Africa soon?
I have no particular plans at present.

Are you engaged to Lady Scarborough?
You mustn't believe the newspapers.

Lord Roxton!
Was it terribly dangerous in the jungle?

The odd rogue elephant.

Nothing as alarming as a society
hostess with marriageable daughters.


Come on, laddie!
Sorry, Mr McArdle.

Millions of years
before the first Angle, Celt or Saxon

set trepidatious foot on this sceptr'd isle,
those astonishing creatures,

to which we give the name dinosaurs,
cast their...

Sir, you need a ticket!
I have important scientific evidence.

Take your hands off me!

Thank you, gentlemen. You MAY let him go.

Despite appearances,
he isn't a burglar or pickpocket.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

I see you're still having trouble
with your timekeeping, Professor Challenger.


The Professor and I were at Oxford together.
He was often late for lectures then, as well.

I was punctual if I thought
there was something worth hearing.

Do you mind?

Mrs Summerlee.
George.

George Challenger.

A slapdash scientist
with an absurdly high opinion of himself.

Summerlee beat him to the Chair of Zoology.
He's never got over it.

When Professor Challenger is finally ready,
perhaps I might continue?

Carry on, Professor.

The very word dinosaur,
meaning "terrible reptile", tells us...

...this is a vertebra from a creature
known as Iguanodon bernissartensis.

Behind me is an artist's impression
of the iguanodon,

which stood on its hind legs
in the manner of a kangaroo.

Oh, come on! A kangaroo?
Are you sure? Have you ever seen one?

Don't be absurd!
No one's ever seen a dinosaur.


The great size of these creatures
was paradoxically their weakness,

for the dinosaurs could not compete
with the smaller and more agile mammals.

Where's his proof?

The proof is that we are here and dinosaurs
are remarkably thin on the ground.


Professor Summerlee...

...I wonder if you would be kind enough
to identify something for me.

I will take questions at the end.

Let's have a look at this first.

Now...

...what do you make of that?

It appears to be
a remarkably well-preserved fossil

of the forearm of a pterosaur,
a flying reptile of the Mesozoic period.

But it isn't a fossil, is it?

There's something up here.
Make sure you get all this down.

Must be a fake.

Clever, undoubtedly, but a fake.

This bone came from an animal...

...that died just two months ago.


This is genuine, Challenger?
Yes.

I say that with authority.

What authority?
Because I shot it myself.

(GASPS OF DISBELIEF)

The pterosaur, far from being extinct,

is alive and well
and living in the Amazon rainforest.

This man is an attention-seeking charlatan!

Hear, hear!

I came here tonight to propose an expedition

to discover the lair of the pterosaur.

(AUDIENCE REACTS)

This stunt is beneath even you, George.
It's no stunt, Leo.

I should like to express my thanks
to Professor Challenger.

I've not been so well amused
since I read Professor Challenger's paper

on the possibility
of conveying mankind to the moon!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

In a rocket!

Professor Challenger!

What exactly is your proposal?

The nest of the pterosaurs is deep
in a dense and unchartered region of Brazil.

Sounds perilous.
I should very much like to join you.

Moreover, I am willing to cover
half the total costs incurred.

(AUDIENCE GASPS)

You can't!

Can we look to science for the balance?
You can look where you like,

but you won't get a penny from any
academic institution with which I am involved.

My name is Edward Malone.
I'm a reporter for The Gazette and...

...I should like to volunteer.

No newspapermen, thank you.
Anyone else?

Lord Brass, proprietor of The Gazette,
will match Lord Roxton's offer.

What?!

In that case, you're in!
Have you gone mad?

This might be the story of the century,
owned exclusively by The Gazette!

Not if he's a raving lunatic.
Then keep me on obituaries forever.

Never mind that, laddie.
You'll be writing your own.

Well, Leo. What do you say?
Why don't you join me?

Nothing on Earth would cause me
to risk my scholarly reputation

by taking part in your ludicrous hare-brained
wild-goose chase of an expedition!

May we have a word? The London Times.

What would you like to know?

May I have your name, sir?
Professor L Summerlee.

You really don't have to do this.
You have nothing to prove.

It's my responsibility to ensure
there's SOME proper science on this trip.

Lord Brass expects a handsome return
on his investment. Make sure he gets it.

I'll do my best, Mr McArdle.

I should have sent Arkwright.
Well, you'll have to do.

Don't come back
without a front page, Malone.

of your expenses, down to the last penny!

Lord Roxton. A few words, sir?
No questions. Thank you.

Bye-bye.

Oh, hello. How sweet of you to come.

I do not expect to find dinosaurs, but I do
understand science is indigestible to people

unless dressed up in a colourful package.

Professor Challenger!
Do you really expect to see dinosaurs?

Ah, there's Mrs Summerlee.
I won't be a moment.

Look after yourself, dear.

Kiss your father, children.

Good luck, sir.
Thank you. See you when we get back.


I hope you know what you're doing, George.

I'm awfully proud of you.
Are you really?

Of course. After all, I expect there'll
be poisonous snakes and hostile natives,

and all sorts of terrible dangers, won't there?

Yes, I suppose.
Good. Or what would be the point in going?

One word, Gladys,
and I'd stay here with you.

Edward, you would hate yourself!
Not necessarily.

(SHIP'S BELL)

Give me your answer.

Edward, you are awfully sweet,
but ever since I was a little girl,

I've always promised myself that
the man I married would be the heroic type.


That's quite enough, young man!
Gladys...

Huh!

(SHE GIGGLES)

Good luck, Challenger.
Illingworth.

That young man is very forward.
It's just as well he's going abroad.

Pretty girl.

Yes, my fiancee, Gladys.

8-calibre. Pistol grip to stock.

Nitro-express cartridge,
firing a charge of 12 drams.

It'll knock down a charging bull elephant.
There are no elephants in Brazil.

I know. But it doesn't hurt to be prepared.

Tell me, Mr Malone.

Have you ever been close enough to a really
dangerous wild animal to stare into its eyes?

I assume not. Shall I tell you
what you see there? Your own death.

An uncomfortable experience.

On the contrary, it's profoundly stimulating.
You might want to get that down.

Gentlemen. If you please.

Time to reveal our destination.
Why did you have to be so secretive?

He didn't trust us to keep our mouths shut.
Yes.

Mr Malone has kindly agreed to keep
an accurate record of our progress.

Now... this is roughly
where I shot the pterosaur.

It's right on the edge
of the unexplored regions.

When I got back, I found this account
of a Portuguese expedition

that went to the same region in 1649.

Only one man returned,
Father Luis Mendoz.

When they found him in the jungle,
it was assumed he was mad.

So we're going to be following a map
drawn up by a lunatic!

He was raving about dragons.
Dinosaurs.

Exactly.

Now, according to Luis Mendoz,

there's a remote plateau
in the middle of the unmapped territory.

He says there's a cave system
leading right the way up to the summit.

His claim makes perfect sense.
Why?

For a pterosaur or any other
prehistoric creature to have survived,

it must have been isolated from
the mainstream of evolutionary development.

Where do you propose we start
our search for this mythical plateau?

It wasn't mythical to Padre Mendoz!
How very reassuring.

Your mind is as fossilised
as the exhibits in your precious museums!

How dare you!
Gentlemen! Please.

There's a small mission
about a week's journey upriver.

It's run by a Reverend Theo Kerr.

A Theo Kerr wrote a very silly book
condemning Darwin.

It's the same man.
Oh, splendid.

my first dispatch, together with expenses.

"Notwithstanding our agreement
that you would rewrite my accounts,

"I have tried to embrace a style
which will appeal to Gazette readers.

"After an uneventful journey
of some seven weeks,

"we find ourselves in the upper reaches
of the mighty Amazon river,

"the greatest river in South America,
if not the world.

"The mission station,
which is our present destination,

"will provide the last chance to savour
the comforts of the civilised world.

"And beyond that lies the hardships
and the terrors of the unknown."

If she's a missionary, I'll be a heathen.
Sh!

Professor Challenger? Agnes Cluny.
My uncle and I have been expecting you.

He went downriver for supplies.
He should be back today.

These are my colleagues. Lord Roxton.

How do you do?
Hello.

Mr Malone.
Hello.

And Professor Summerlee.

This way.

This is Samuel, the lead bearer.
Pleased to meet you.

He wants to know
which direction you're headed.

Ten days due north.

(INDIAN LANGUAGE)

Something wrong?
The Indians say there are bad spirits there.

Ah, well. He may find this
more powerful than "curipuri".

(INDIAN LANGUAGE)

Yes?

Ah, no. That to go. This to come back.

What did you tell him?

That their wives will not thank them
if they refuse the work.

I'll take that.

Little Miss Muffet, she sat on a tuffet
eating her curds and whey. Along came a...

What ARE you on about?

Stay still!

The tarantula
can give a nasty bite if provoked.

Ugly brute, isn't it?
I think they're fascinating.

Roxton, take charge here, will you?
Just coming, Professor.

I was born here. My parents were botanists.

They died in an accident on the river
when I was five.

My uncle... I call Theo my uncle.
He was a good friend of my parents.

He brought me up.

They built this church.

In your letter you didn't say
exactly why you were coming here.

Of course, it's none of my business.
No, no.

It would be unfair to enjoy your hospitality
and not tell you the truth.

But you might find it hard to believe.
You wouldn't be alone in that regard.


(EXCITED SHOUTS)

Professor Challenger, I presume?

(OPERA: "THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO")


It must be wonderful to see one.

Regarding Mendoz,
I've heard stories about him.

He was... oh, yes...

...quite mad.

This "curipuri", what is that?
Superstition.

Curipuri are the bad spirits
that haunt a man's dreams.

Sometimes they take the shape
of great birds or lizards.

You hear that, Leo?

You'll not find any dinosaurs
around here, gentlemen.

You're quite right to be sceptical, Reverend.

The Dinosauria became extinct
over sixty million years ago.

Sixty million years.
My goodness, a long time.

No. The Earth
is only 6,000 years old.

The calculation can easily be made
from the biblical evidence.

Do these calculations
take fossils into account?

Of course.

Fossils are the remains of creatures
that were deposited after the great flood.

The ones that didn't make it
into the ark, I suppose (!)

I have to see to the lamps.
Goodnight, everyone.

I think I'll turn in, too. Goodnight.

I am aware, Professor,
that you disagree with my views.

But your theory of evolution
makes no sense to me.

More than creating the world in seven days.
Six. God rested on the seventh.

Thank you for not laughing at my uncle.

I don't share his beliefs but I respect his faith.

I have some difficulty
with Mr Darwin's monkeys myself.

So many beautiful things
are hidden away in remote places.

I suppose that must be
the attraction for a scientist,

to discover one of those beautiful things.

But the Bible is not a textbook!

No, it's the word of God.
It is no basis for serious science.

You would replace God with man?
And you'd replace science with twaddle?

Goodnight, gentlemen.

I wonder if I might have a word?

Was I flirting? And what if I was?

She's young.
Not much younger than you.

'She's been brought up in the jungle. '

She has no idea of men and women.
The birds and the bees.

I'm sure she's familiar with them,
not to mention every other biting insect.

But it IS obvious that socially
she's a little...

Well, backward.
Edward, grateful as I am for this chat,

and for your advice, but perhaps in future
you'd like to mind your own damn business!

Goodnight.

Goodnight.

Agnes has just asked if she can join us.
No, no, no.

She'd be very useful. She's an expert in local
medicines and speaks the Indian dialect.

Taking a woman on an expedition
is a bad idea.

Men can rub along and rough it together.
Women have different needs.

She's lived here all her life.
She'll be less of a liability than Mr Malone.

So do I. We're entering into the unknown.

It's no place for women.

My niece tells me she has offered
to go with you on your expedition.

Yes, we've just been discussing it.
I cannot allow it.

Agnes has been with me
since her parents died.

She's everything to me.

Oh, Agnes.

I was just talking to Professor Challenger,
and he's agreed...

Why don't we ask Miss Agnes
what SHE wants to do?

George...

We can't watch these people go off
into the jungle and not offer them our help.

Is it charity or your own ambition
that makes you want to go?

Does the Psalm not say,
"The Lord careth for the strangers"?

Don't worry, Reverend.
We'll get her back safely.

"Six days upriver, we enter territory
where native tribes are beyond the reach

"even of Christian missionaries.

"We have been joined in our endeavours
by Miss Agnes Cluny,

"the Reverend Theo Kerr's niece.

"Her reasons for taking part
in our expedition are not altogether clear.

"Our readers may be interested to know
she has adapted to the rigours of jungle life

"by wearing trousers at all times,
even at dinner!

"Professor Challenger is in his element.

"Nothing will divert his single-minded
determination to achieve our goal,

"not even 'amahuaca cannibals',
as he casually named them.

"Fortunately, they don't seem
TOO interested in us... yet."

You suck the insect into the bag.
I know how to use it, thank you.

Really? I thought you might have forgotten.

It's been a long time
since you've done any REAL science!


Yes.
Jolly good.

Coffee?

Thank you.

"A hundred miles upstream from the mission,
we find the secret tributary

"along which Professor Challenger
returned on his previous journey.

"His 'private gate into the unknown',
as he called it.

"The drums that had worried us earlier
have started again, much closer now.

"Their menace is reflected
on the faces of our Indian bearers.

"We ARE being watched."

I was wondering whether you might have
a remedy for these biting insects.

Mmm.

You get these leaves...

Yeah.

...and crush them, and mix them with urine.

What, my own? Yes...

Yes.

Rub it into your skin.
You'll find it quite effective.

Thank you.

"Our canoes hidden, we continue on foot,

"our trusty bearers taking the greater
burden of the expedition's equipment.

"As we get further from civilisation,
I am grateful to Miss Cluny

"for sharing with me the quaint and often
surprising folk remedies of the jungle."

(AGNES SNIFFS)

(SNIFFS, THEN SIGHS)


Pwoar!

(INDIAN LANGUAGE)

What are they talking about?
Curipuri. They don't like it here.

Um... Professor Challenger?
I think you'd better look at this.


Stay in the camp. Stay in the camp!

What is this?
Some kind of tribal fetish, or what?

I don't know.

(INDIANS CALL OUT ANXIOUSLY)

Where are you going?

Don't be ridiculous. Come back!

Don't expect to be paid!

Pah!

Look at all this stuff. This is ludicrous!
How far can we go without bearers?

As far as we have to.


Uncle?

You people have been making good time.
I've been tracking you for days.

Ah. How are you doing?

I hope you don't mind.
I wanted to join you, but perhaps it's too late.

We've had some trouble.
Yes, I passed the Indians.

I tried to reason with them,
but they're a very superstitious people.

What can you do? Nothing.

Go back, I guess.
Oh, no.

We go on, without bearers.

Which way are you headed?
Due north.

May I suggest you turn north-east?
I think you'll find the going easier.

According to Mendoz's map,
the plateau lies due north, there.

I myself have penetrated
some little ways into this jungle.

It's not easy going.

In a couple of days you CAN turn back north.

North-east. Very well.

"You may be surprised how superstition
can influence the uncivilised mind;

"how a crude effigy of sticks and bones

"can send natives
screaming hysterically into the night.

"It is fortuitous that
the Reverend Kerr should turn up

"just when we had been abandoned
by our timid bearers.

"The way north must be arduous indeed
if this is easy by comparison."

I can take something if you like.
It's been a while since I had a rucksack.

"After three days, we reach a river
and our progress improves dramatically."

there are piranha in these waters?

Piranha aren't dangerous. That's a myth.

It's the snakes you have to watch.
That's right.

One bite from a coral snake
and you're dead in seconds.

Not necessarily. A young man in good health
might live for up to a minute!

I shouldn't worry, Mr Malone.

Coral snakes are far more frightened of us.

Keep VERY still.

Oh, my God!


Keep calm, Edward!

It's the bag. There's something in the bag.
Drop the bag, Edward.

Ah!

Get rid of the bag!
What?

Urgh! Ah!


It's all right. It's all right.

What the hell was in it?
Some insect specimens.

New species, as far as I could see.
I'm most disappointed to have lost them.

You should be more careful. It was probably
those insects that attracted the snakes.

I hardly think so.

Puzzling.

He's a... very determined man, isn't he?

I can think of other words that describe him.

Are you all right?
Yes. Thank you.

Can I see?
Please do.

Everything in this place wants to eat me.

These are REALLY good.
Thank you.

It must be strange for you,
living at the mission.

It's all I've ever known.
No, I mean being so far from civilisation.

Perhaps we are not as uncivilised
as you think, Mr Malone.

At the mission I can have any books I want.

My uncle has his gramophone.

Perhaps we're not as
"socially backward" as you imagine.

"We never did discover what it was
that so attracted the coral snakes,

"let alone how it came
to be in Professor Summerlee's bag."

quickly as you can.

# Oh, Mr Porter,
what a silly girl I am. #

Must you sing?
Yes. It keeps the spirits up.

It has the opposite effect on me.

Lord Roxton? May I borrow your pistol?

There's something that needs shooting.
With pleasure.


The plateau!

Right where Mendoz's map said it would be!

Congratulations.
Thank you.

"Our efforts have been rewarded.
The memory all of our difficulties fades away

"as we gaze at the grandeur
of this magnificent sight.

"We had placed our trust
in Padre Mendoz and his map,

"and once again he has proved sound.

"There IS a cave system,
exactly as he claimed.

"Thank the Lord, for without it

"the towering cliff face
would be insurmountable."

(DRIPPING WATER)

Watch your heads, everybody.

Leo.

Look at this!

Look, it's an iguanodon!
Nonsense. Iguanodon went on two legs.

Oh, yes, that's right. Just like a kangaroo.

God! The limitations
of the encyclopaedic mind!


Nothing here.


What is it?
I'm afraid the cave's blocked.

This was the only route to take us up.


Powder marks. I think it's been blasted.

Blasted? Why would somebody do that?

What now, Professor?
We have no choice.

We have to continue around the base
of the plateau until we DO find a way up.

Ooh.

What a little beauty!

Come and see what I've got!

Coming, Professor?

Whatever it is, I've probably seen it
a hundred times already.

An atlas moth.
Attacus atlas.

Beautiful, isn't it?
Beautiful.

It's your expedition, Professor,
but if it was me...

I would want to get my people home
before any serious harm came to them.

Everyone is here of their own free will.

(CREATURE SHRIEKS)

Pterosaur. It's a pterosaur!

Challenger! Look, an atlas moth.


What have you done with our dinner?

A real-life pterosaur just swooped off
with our dinner, and you bring me a moth!

What?
Really? Where?

Beautiful!

Reverend?

It MUST have been a vulture.

Since when do vultures snatch roasting pigs
from spits? It was a pterosaur, damn it!

The Amazon vulture is a VERY big bird,
and in the dark...

Will you deny the evidence
of your own eyes?

It was reptilian.
It didn't have a bloody feather on it!

walked nearly halfway round this plateau.

Our supplies are getting dangerously low.

And just look at these cliffs!
There's no way up.

I will NOT be dragged around any further
on this wild-goose chase!

Professor Summerlee is right.
Our supplies are very low.

We should go back while we can.

"Just as the rigours of the expedition
were taking their toll,

"Professor Challenger spotted
what seemed to be a route to the summit.

"Though weak from hunger and exhaustion,
we applied ourselves to the ascent."

Not much further.

Come on, Edward.

(CHALLENGER GASPS)


We are going to need all the length.


Perfect! Ha!

Ladies and gentlemen,
I now declare this bridge open!

Start crossing.


I'm... I'm forgetting my manners.
Ladies first.


Agnes, don't go.

It's all right, Uncle.

Don't!
It's quite safe.




Steady.

Well done!

All right?

Almost there.

We've come this far. Just don't look down.

Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Well done, Professor.

Get his pack off.

Ready, Professor?

See, it's easy. Easy as falling off a log.

(HUMS QUIETLY)

Oh-oh-oh!

No!

Ah!

Hold on!

Don't look down!

I'm OK.
