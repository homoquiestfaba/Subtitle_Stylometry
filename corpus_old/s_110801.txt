Ray is like

ghetto fabulous version of Renfield or some shit.

Ever read Dracula?

So he should be pretty easy to kill.

You got all types of weaknesses.

Crosses.

Wooden stakes.

Silver bullets. Holy water.

See this nigga beern gettin' his read-on in prison, huh?

Daylight. Can't go to somebody's house unless you're
invited.

Matter of faot, how'd you get this place?

Bought it... with the money we got at that last job.

Rememberthat last job?


l'm about to fuck you up. This ain't seven years ago.

This is my spot.

What the fuck do you want from me?

Need you to crack another safe.

What for?.

lt's not like you need any more money.

You gonna go buy a truckload of sunblock and chill at
the beach?

Ha, ha. Thats funny.

No, l need an amulet

that will lift this fucking curse off of me.

l don't want to be a vampire no more.

And there's this amulet

and it's in a highly guarded safe

with a timer on it.

Kinda like that last job we did.

Yeah. We all know how that tumed out.

When l get the amulet-

l don't give a fuck about you. Whats in it for me?

A whole lot of paper.

So you mean to tell me that you're gonna pay me for
a job

with money that you already owe me

forthe last fuckin' job we did together!

Exaotly.

Think about it, Jakeem.

l'm offering you a lot... of dough.

Who knows?

You could be set forthe rest of yourfuckin' life.

Can't get a job.

Joint, jail, job. No.

Who knows?

Maybe you can even buy that little cripple bitch some
rims

for her wheelchair
[chuckles]

forfuckin' her whole life up.

What if l don't do it?.

lf you don't do it... hmm.

l will rip out your heart and...

feed it to Ray.

Like that, Ray, right?.

Nigga lover heart.

Always tellin' me, ''Give me some heart, man.''

l'm not stupid.

Either way you're gonna screw me overr.

So you might as well suck me dry now.

Ungh!

Oooh!

You know what, Jakeem?

Think about it.

No need to make rash decisions now.

Contemplate.

Holler at me tomorrow.

Mover, nigga.

Hey!

How you doin'?

All right.

Where you headed to?

Oh, the grocery store.

Gotta pick up some milk and eggs and stuff.

And Twinkies and doughnuts.

Yeah, yeah.

One bag of Fritos. Thats it.

You can cook?.

Um...

Nah, forget it.


Don't you wish you had someone to do that for you?

No.

l don't need anybody's help.

You don't wish you were rich?

Some money would help, l guess.

Pay some medical bills. You know. Stuff like that.

What would you do if you won the lottery?.

l guess l would...

Well, definitely pay off my medical bills, you know.

Umm...

Pay the rent.

Taking a vacation sounds nice tco.

Why are you asking me this?

l don't know.

You know, thats a common question.

'What would you do if you won the lottery?.'

Yeah.

l don't have a million dollars, you know.

lt's not a big issue for me now.

l'm sorry.

What is that?.

So you can buy a lottery ticket.

Lcok, l don't need your pity.

l wasn't-
Really. l don't need your help.

Whats up, Jakeem?

Why you lcokin' like that, man?

Every time you come around here, you're lcokin'
depressed.

That Matchbox bitch ain't giving you no pussy?.


Why you keep playin', man? [coughs]

Are you in or out?.


Come on, man.

Fuck.

Ahh! Lcok, man. Bull's-eye.

l didn't come here forthis.

Okay, boss, this is a job that we gotta do in the day

'cause they're not gonna expect us.

Especially two humans,

'cause they're usually guarding against vampires.

One and a half humans.

Okay, you got jokes.

This is a diagram of how it's gonna get down.

This is the front gate.

This is where the first guard is.

Afterthe first guard, there's gonna be two more.

How we get past the first guard?

Let me finish.

Once we get past these two guards here,

we head to this little room.

Thats where the safe is.

There might be one guard there. l don't know.

After we get pa-

When we get to the timer, we have about 60 seconds.

Afterthem 60 seconds, if we take tco long,
it'll alert more, so you have to be quick.

How do we get past the first guard?

Tear gas.

Sounds like a fuckin' dheathtrap.

Thats what it is, man.

lf we use tear gas, the whole rest of the block

is gonna swarm down on us.

Neverthought of that one.

How are you so sure that there's three to four pecple
inside?

Possibly.
How do you know this?

This is what l scoped out three weeks ago.

After we get past the first guard,

you don't think the rest will just rush to the froht?.

l didn't think of that one right there.

Escape route?

The front dcor.

So there's no escape route.

Not that l know of. No.


l think you need to leave the plannin' to me and...

-just let me be the boss.
Okay.

'Cause you don't know what the fuck you're doin'.

Tend to your business, boss.


First rule...

is if we walk there and the shit dcesn't lcok right,

we leave immediately.

Okay.
[clears throat]

Second rule is no guns.

What the fuck you mean, ''no guns''?

How we supposed to get past fourto five guards with
no guns?

Smile at 'em?

No guns.

All right.

Just makin' this shit harder, though.

l get there and see you with a gun, l'm walkin' away.

Okay, boss.
[clears throat]

All right, listen.


So, we ready to do this?

He by hisselftco.

lt's easy like that.

We distraot him and then hit him in the head with the
club.

Okay, that works.

Mm-hm!

Jeez, Ced, what you..?

There's cough medicine in there. Don't touch that.
Yeah.

Like l said, l did hear a good joke, though.

Whats the difference between Michael Jackson

One is used to carry your groceries.

The other is dangerous for children to play with.


What are you doin' about dinner?.

Throw Barry in there for me.

No more Barry Manilow, please.

lt helps me relax Cedric.

l'd rather listen to fuckin' Barbra Streisand.

Barry's the man.

l can't believe this, man.

What the fuck?. lt's him!

Whats he got around his fucking...

He's got it around his neck like a gold chain.
Mover in. We got him.

Lets go.

Yo, my man. Can l talk to you for a second?

You know somethin'!

Stop frontin', motherfucker! Speak!

You killed four of our pecple.

What the fuck?. Speak already!

Gentlemen, gentlemen. Gentlemen.

We don't want to be rude to our guest.

Jakeem.

The infamous.

How are you?

l told you. l don't know what you're talking about.

Whatd you tell me? l didn't ask you anything yet.

How do you know what l'll ask?.

My name is Cedric.

Those men you murdered, those men were mine.

That amulet you stole, that belonged to me.

Now,

the questioning begins.

Are you ready?.

Who'd you steal that for?.

l told you. l don't know what you're talkin' about.

Really?. Really?.

Why would you come into my home, steal my amulet,

and kill four of my men?

Good men.

l don't know if l believe him.
You don't know?.

This motherfucker's lying.

Security cameras watched you shoot one of my men
in the leg,

so you had to have something to do with something.

Can you give me some information?

Talk!

You realize that you're just a vampire dog?

Huh?

lf you couldn't go out in the daylight,

you'd be just as dead as my men.

Since you don't want to tell me the story, l tell you
what.

Okay.

l used to pitch forthe triple A.

Only reasons l never made it to the majors

was because l only had one pitch.

A hundred-mile-an-hourfastball.

Kinda defines me.

Straightforward and hard.

So now we're gonna play a game. You ready?.

Get my shit. Get my shit.

Now we're gonna play a game. You know what the
game is?

Three strikes and Jakeem tells me all l wanna know.

Ready?.

Get the fuck outta here.

You lcok just like my catcher, baby.

Get outta town. So what are we sayin'?

Yeah!

Yeah! Check this out. Clear me some space, y'all.

Play ball!

Batter up!

Now, l'm gonna ask you one time.

We can end this now or we can go through yourthree
strikes.

Give me a sign.

Oh, your hands are behind you.

l just assume you gave me the number one. How's
that?.

You ready?.

Fuck you!

Here comes the first one.

Give me a sign. Huh? Ready?.

Fuck you!


Hang tough!

Oh, shit!
He got heart!

He got heart, don't he? Which ear y'all waht?.

Left!
Which one? Ready?.

Here it comes. You ain't got nothin' for me?

We can make this end now. l'll take that ear.

We can make it end.

Huh? Nothing?

Okay, here we go.

Here it comes!

Whooee!

l am the shit!

[all yelling agreement]

Hit him again!

Gentlemen.

Whats going on, Ced?

Just rappin' with our boy, Jakeem.

You know, tryin' to find out whats goin' on.

Just tryin' to figure out.

''Rappin'''?

Gimme the ball.

What ball?

Give me the ball.

What we got?.

The amulet. Thats first.

But as far as information,

this vampire dog dcesn't wanna give us any.

Kinda tight lipped, but

we'll get it out of him.

We're just gettin' friendly, right?.

Lcok...

l told you l don't know what you're talking about.

Bullshit.

Yeah, l did steal the amulet.

But it wasn't my choice.

You had choices, Jakeem.

They were all bad,

but you had choices.

Do you have any idea the powerthis amulet has?

Don't answerrthat.

Do you have any idea

what would have happened had Khalil got his hands
on it?.

He would have beern invincible

to everything we have,

including daylight.

Or do vampire flunkies like you even care?

Some shit funny?.
Whats funny?.

You're a bunch of stupid motherfuckers.

Why the fuck do you keep that amulet around?

Huh?

So some evil mastermind can steal the shit?.

And take overrthe world?

Oh, wait, wait.

Are y'all vampires?

Do we lcok like motherfuckin' vampires?

Then what the fuck you need the amulet for?.

l think you'll be needing us real scon.

l think you need to let me go.

l think you need to hold on to that.

Lets go.

Come on.

Lets go, Ced.

See you later, sweetheart.

See you next season.

You betteer run as scon as you let them shits go.

All right, bitch. l'm done fuckin' with you.

Wco! Wco, woo, woo!

Whats wrong?

What do you want, man? What do you waht?.

Nothin'. l thought you'd be lcokin' forthat cripple bitch.

Don't worry about your girl.

Lets go, Ced.
Lets get out of here.

You all gotta let me come.

No way.

No civilians on my team.

Come on. lt makes sense.

He's expecting me with the amulet.

You get wounded in there ortum into one of them
freaks,

No job, no benefits.

You're suing us for something that dcesn't even make
sense.

Shit, not to mention what happened
to that cat, Clay Van Helsing.

They got him for 2.5 million just for mentioning

the Stake Party.

No way we bring this civilian.

Lcok, but l can be a decoy or something.


Let me show up like l have the amulet

and his attention will be focused on me.

l can't even believe you're entertaining this bullshit.

l come by myself, he thinks l have the amulet

and then you can ambush him.

Lcok, l can benefit everyone.

You know what happened to-

Leave everybody, you know, happy, safe.

And-
Use me as a shield.

lf you interrupt me one more time,

you won't make it out this basement.

Wait a minute. He has a point.

See? She's the smart one.

[continues ringing]

Hello.


I have a severe, severe vampire problem.

You gotta help me out.

Hello?

Jesus Christ!

Come on, pal. You gotta help me out.

I run a mortuary business.

I got people coming out of theirgraves left and right.

You know how expensive it is
to bury people again and again?

Families are going nuts!

Nobody's here, man.

Oh, you¡re killin'me.

Look, look, look, I'll do anything.

Just send somebody now.

I'll pay ten grand.

How much?

Ten grand.

ls that cash?

These days I'm always tryin'to get at myself -

Stressin; always workin'
to impress myself -

You see
I gotta be, gotta be -

The number one, that's
my philosophy, honestly -

I feel like
the world's on top of me -

Stoppin'me from movin'forward ever constantly -

I M.C. because I'm not
the type to silently, quietly -

Stand by, I got a life
to lead, time to see -

I know a man named me
that I gotta be -

And fuck they, he and she
'cause it's not me -

Know what I'm sayin'
What ain't real about havin'a job -

What the fuck isn't real
about havin'a love -

The same shit that's real about bein'a thug -

The same shit that's real about a shotgun slug -

The same shit that's real about college degrees -

'Cause that's the shit
that got me kickin'out -

Makin'these Gs -

My brother Steve's
on the court -

'Cause to ball is his dream -

Mind the rhyme, how it is
how it always has been -

See it's not
the lines that you read -

But the shit in between -

Thugs is made out of dirt
yet I still stay clean -

Because I'm real -

This is for all my people ridin'the trains
Stay real -

Just to go to work
in small-time chains -

The really real livin'poor
so it's not in their place -

I stay real, don't give
a damn what haters will say -

I keep it real
Yeah, I know these days it'sjust a cliché -

But I was real
way before you saw me on TV-

I'm still real 'cause my momma brought me up that
way -

I'm really real 'cause I'm made of blood and not
money -

I'm what's real, really real
This is something you feel -

I say real, you say real -

'Cause it's something
you feel -

For all my real people
that I cann feel -

Put up your hands
Pump your fists -

Make some noise
if you will -

I'm what's real, real, real
This is something you feel -

In you room, in your ride
on your box outside -

In your headphones
launchin'at you side to side -

On your bus when you know
you got a long-ass ride -

Remember them days -

Cats with the fat lip
seemed to have it all made -

And I love when my people livin'right and on type
-

But jealousy is a bitch... -
