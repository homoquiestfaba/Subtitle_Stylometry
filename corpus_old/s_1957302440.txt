<i>Shadyside, small-town America.</i>

<i>But among locals, a history of horror
has earned it another nickname,</i>

<i>"Killer Capital USA."</i>

<i>And last nightâ€¦</i>

<i>â€¦tragedy struck again.</i>

<i>I'm here with Sheriff Nick Goode.</i>

<i>Sheriff, what can you tell us?</i>

<i>Um, there were seven victims.</i>

[screams]
[Josh] <i>None of thisâ€¦ is random.</i>

Sarah Fier was hanged for witchcraft.

She's been possessing people,
turning them into killers,

to take revenge on the town.


[tires screeching]


[menacing music crescendos]

But in 1978,
there was one survivor, C. Berman.

She's the key.

with a massacre at the mall.</i>

<i>And now an already mourning community
is plunged into horror yet again</i>

more carnage at East Union Medical.</i>

<i>Police believe the murders
were fueled by amphetamines.</i>

<i>Local teenagers Kate Schmidt

<i>The scene of the final carnage

<i>Sheriff Nick Goode found the Grab and Bag

Stop, please! Please! We called you.

Hello, my name is Deena Johnson.
We need to know how you survived!

Hey! We're being attacked, alright?
There are killers here!

[Deena] <i>Pick up! We need your help!</i>
[Josh] <i>Please!</i>

Hello?
You're still alive.

C. Bermanâ€¦


Why the hell would you come here?

[grunting]
[C. Berman] No!

No, no, no! You need to leave! Right now!
You have no idea what you are doing!


You are the only person
who knows what we're dealing with.

I don't want that thing near me.
Get that car and "it" off my property.

Her name is Sam.

You could have watched us dead
on the six o'clock news,

but you didn't.

You called us back.


You are our last chance! The witch...

No, I'm sorry.

and tied up in a trunk, but youâ€¦

you saw her and you survived.

What was different? Please.

Maybe something happened to you,
something that can help us stop her.

[C. Berman] There's not!
You can't stop her.

Run, far as you can, fast as you can!

That is your only chance.

Look, I can't just run!

Look, Samâ€¦

I can't let her die.

I won't!

I love her.

Please!

Just keep her away from Major Tom.

[Sam grunting]

[Sam grunting]

[Sam grunting]

[Deena clears throat]

It's completely fine.

She's tied up in the bathroom,
so she, like,

totally can't leave now, we're cool.

Cool, cool.

Take a seat.

[C. Berman] In Shadyside,

the past is never really past.

This was Julyâ€¦ 12th.

[she grunts]

[coughing, gasps]

[ravens cawing]

[gasping, groans]

You're gonna hang, witch.

[kids chanting]
Before the witch's final breath,

she found a way to cheat her death.


she kept her grip upon our land!

She reaches from beyond the grave,
to make good men her evil slaves.

She'll take your blood, take your head,
she'll follow you until you're dead.

[redhead grunts]
[girl 1] String her up.



Let me down, you shits! Let me down!

Well, well. What do we have here?
Goddamn thief!

[girl 1] No. No, she's no thief.

She's possessed by the witch.

The only way to explain
her psycho behavior.

Fuck you!
[they gasp]

[redhead panting]

Guess we're even now.

You do know what they did
to Sarah Fier, right?

They hanged her,

from this very tree.

But she'd have died forever if you did
what you always do to witchesâ€¦

You burn them.

Give me your lighter!
What?

Give it to me!

Now, hold her legs.

Seriously, Sheila?

Do it! [flicks lighter open]

No, no, no! Stop it!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

Shut up, you witch.
Sheila! You made your point.

Don't! Don't!
[boy] Sheila, it was only ten bucks.

[girl 2] Are we really gonna do this?

Sheila!
No, no, no!

[girl 2] Sheila!
[screams]

[Sheila] Shit! Will, your brother.
The hell is this? Let her down!

Nick, I can explain.

Let her down, Will!
I swear to God I'll tell Mom!


the door was open.

All my money was gone
and Ziggy was just sprinting away.

Because you were chasing me.
Ziggy! You talk when I tell you to talk.

Did you see her take it?
Everyone did.

[girls] Everyone.
Alright.

Well, that's it, Berman.
Five strikes. You're out.

I'm out? They just tried to murder me!
Yeah. And I'll deal with them.

But first, get back to camp, call Mommy
because you're done at Nightwing.

I didn't do it.
[boy 2] Oh, yeah?

Like you didn't set the camp flag on fire?

Or let out the camp rabbits?
Or graffiti the outhouse stalls?

I warned you...
[Sheila] Kurt.

It's not her fault, really.

She's possessed by Sarah Fier.
Oh, youâ€¦

[Kurt] Hey, hey, hey!
[Nick] Hey, hey.

We kick her out, somebody's gonna ask
about the burn on her arm.

Then who's in trouble? Huh?

Why don't we just let this one slide?
Yeah?

Alright. One more strike and you're out
for real. You hear me, Berman?

One more.

Being bossed around by a Goode.

Wow, some things never change.

God, I hate that little bitch.

[children playing, shouting]


Have Nurse Lane check that burn out.
I'm gonna let it get infected and die.



I'm sorry, I forgot!

Thank you, King of Sunnyvale,

future Police Chief Nick Goode,

for rescuing poor, helpless Shadysider me!

How could I ever repay you?

Oh, I know. I'll bat my eyes at you,
like all the other dumbass girls.

I'm sorry, but we don't have a choice.

This is our last one, babe.

What are you doing?

Three guesses.


[Cindy groans]

This isn't funny. We have a job to do.

Alice, put that down.
[Alice] Or what?

What, are you gonna snitch on me again?

to your little friend Nurse Lane.

About getting us some yellow jackets.
Yes.

Or some red birds.
Both.

Just hook us up.
[Cindy] No!

No, I won't do that!

Nurse Lane! Hello!

I'm in trouble again. Help.

Nurse Lane, come on!
I could die any minute now.

Nurse Lane?

Nurse Lane?

[mysterious music playing]

[woman] What are you doing?
Oh my God!

Nurse Lane, you scared the shit out of me.

Are you OK?

[sighs, sniffs]

I am. Oh my goodness.

Ziggy, Ziggy, Ziggy.

What did we do now?

OK, so you are gonna apply this

It's gonna protect against infection.

It's gross.


So, umâ€¦ what's the Witch's Mark?

[ominous music playing]

You know about my daughter, right?
Ruby Lane?

Uhâ€¦

I don't...
Of course you do.

Everybody talks, I know.

Tell me, what do they say?

Uh, umâ€¦ They say she, uhâ€¦

she killed peopleâ€¦

at a party.

Seven, seven friends.
Eight.

She killed herself that night too.

So eight.

Ruby was such a sweet girl.

Oh, and she had a sweet voice.
She was in choir.

She wanted to be a singer.

[Ruby singing]
â™ª <i>You always hurt the one you love</i> â™ª

I was so proud of her.

So proud.

The doctors say
it was a psychotic episode,

that she just snapped.

But the kidsâ€¦

the kids say Sarah Fier made her do it.

That's a little tight.

What do you think?
I don't...

'Cause I think you don't go
from being a sweet girl with dreams

to ripping someone's insides out
with a switchblade.

{\an8}- Nurse Lane!
People usually kill for a reason,

{\an8}and sometimes that reason is justified.

{\an8}Sometimes killing isn't murder.

{\an8}- Sometimes it's necessary.
That's hurting me.

{\an8}- Sometimes it is good.
Nurse Lane!

Once a day for three days, OK?

[bell ringing]
[door closes]

Hi, Nurse Lane.

Hi, Cindy.

Ziggy.

You realize what happens
if you get kicked out, right?

How awful that would be for me?
Did someone do something to Nurse Lane?

Like make fun of her daughter?

Ziggy, are you listening to me?
She was upset.

I don't care! Iâ€¦

Do you hear what I'm saying to you?
Loud and clear, ma'am.

You don't, we had this conversation
last week and the week before that.

I'm not gonna get kicked out.
That's not what Kurt thinks.

Yeah, well, Kurt can suck it.
No! Ziggy, no!

If you get kicked out, I do too.

Mom can't work and take care of you.
Then how will I pay for college, huh?

[Ziggy scoffs]
Oh, that's funny to you?

Yeah, kinda.


How dumb you are?

No one gets out of this town,
not even Miss Perfect.

Bet on your way out
you get run over by a bus.

Once in your life,
could you just not be soâ€¦ so mean?

Could once in your life
you just stop pretending?

You're Shadyside, in case you forgot.

["Bitterblue" playing]

Alice just, likeâ€¦
She just won't let it go.

It's like we're still 12 years old

to punish me for something
that wasn't even my fault.

I can't believe
you guys used to be friends.

And Ziggyâ€¦ [groans]

It's only a matter of time
before she ends up in jail or worse.

I'm trying to be a good role model
and make something of myself.

But no, no,
I'm the stuck-up priss who hates fun,

which isn't even true at all.
I like fun. I like fun!

I justâ€¦ I just want
to get out of Shadyside. Is that so crazy?


Shit!


Not now, Tommy! Not in the mood!

She had a grudge against you?

No grudge. No, we barely ever talked.

Iâ€¦ I go to get bug spray from her.
That's it.

It just doesn'tâ€¦
it doesn't make any sense.

Whyâ€¦ why would she do something like this?

She was nuts, just like her kid.
Nurse Lane, she never seemed crazy.

That's what she said about her kid, but
sane people don't chop up their friends.

Now, tell me again what happened.

sheâ€¦ she came into the kitchenâ€¦

Hey, witch. So sorry.

I know you and Nurse Psycho were close.

You can visit her in jail now.
Fuck off, Sheila.

By the way,

you might want to check your stuff.

I think there was an accident
in cabin five.

[dramatic music playing]

[girl] Look at her!
[Sheila] Hurry, witch! Run!

[man 1] Hey, Nicky.

Officer Kapinski.

Been meaning to say I'm sorry
about your Pops. He was a good man.

He was a great man. Taken too soon.

Thank you. Yeah. We all miss him.

Well, he was at peace, knowing one day
you'd be following in his footsteps.

["The Reaper (Don't Fear)" playing]

Nurse Lane's daughter killed 7 people.
[boy] Her daughter was Ruby Lane.

She was clearly possessedâ€¦
just like her crazy daughter.

Sarah Fier strikes again.

[girl] How does the witch choose them?
[sighs] It's crazy.

Is Color War gonna be canceled?
It starts tonight.

Psycho Shadysiders
always fucking ruin everything!

She said one way or another,
I was gonna die tonight.

Spooky!

The kiddos are right.
That's, like, totally witchy behavior.

It's just, there must be some explanation.
The witch isn't real.

Like what?
Well, maybeâ€¦

Maybe she was on something.


I'm not talking about marijuana.

Just admit you're jealous that the witch
wanted your hubby all to herself!

Be serious, man. Why would Nurse Mary
wanna do something like that?

Why would she want me dead?
Oh, no. She wouldn't.


[girl laughing]

Hey, they're just playing around.

This was nothing, I promise.

Did you see her eyes?

There was something in there,
something wrong.

[loud clapping]
[shouting] Alright!

Chicks, dicks, listen up!

We had a scary situation earlier,
but we cannot let that mess

of our summer.

Tonight is Sunnyvale versus Shadyside.

It is red versus blue.
It is good versus evil.

Tonight, we commencicate Color War!

be a stain on our legacy.



like our ancestors before us

and murder those Shadyside witches!

Thank you, Kurt, for that neat-o speech.

I need to talk to you.
I'm not in the mood.

Earlier, you said Mary was upset.

[scoffs] Oh, so now you care!
Ziggy, this is serious.

It was serious earlier,
and you didn't give a shit.

Come on, you were the last person
to see her before she snapped.

What about drugs? Did you see any around?

She's a nurse, so yup.

Well, did she mention anything or...
Nope.

Ziggy, I'm justâ€¦ I'm trying to understand
what happened today.


freaked out and acting weird andâ€¦

It's just a big joke to everyone.
"Mary was possessed by the witch."

Maybe it was the witch.
Ziggyâ€¦

What? That doesn't fit your carefully
constructed bullshit view of the world?

Why are you being like this?
I dunno.

Maybe because Nurse Lane was
the only person who was nice to me,

and now her life is over because
bad things always happen to Shadysiders.

Nothing just happens.
There's always a reason.

Not always a rational one.
Deep down, you feel it, don't you?

Shadyside, there's something here.
It's just holding us down, cursing us.

Ziggy, that's enough.
You're too scared to admit it.

When things go bad,
you wanna explain it away.

I'm sorry. I'm not going to blame
everything on some fairy tale.

Life sucks sometimes. I get that.
I mean, God knows it's been hard sinceâ€¦

Since what?

See, you can't even say it!

Since Dad left.

Since Mom started drinking.

Since we're going to lose the house.

And it's not gonna magically get better.

And saving up all summer to buy
a super cute polo shirt can't hide that.

Trying to explain why nice old Nurse Lane
almost lost it today can't either.

We're all cursed.

For Mary, it was today.

But someday, it'll be you.

And this whole fake
bullshit life of yours,

it's gonna come crashing down.

That's a horrible thing to say.

It's not horrible if it's true.

But you're not my sister.

Alice, it's Mary's diary.

It's not just a diary.

It's a map.

What?

Crazy Nurse Lane made a crazy map.

It's camp,
but looks like she drew all over it.

Union, that's Shadyside.
What?

The settlement before it was divided

Really?

So, the camp is built in the same place
as the settlement?

Whoa, look, look, look! Sarah Fier!

[Alice] We're gonna find you, Sarah Fier!
Tommy! [echoing]

[whispering voice] <i>Tommyâ€¦</i>


Come on, they took everything!

["Ever Fallen In Love" playing]

[knocking on door]

Go away, Cindy!

It's me. It's Nick.

Go away, Nick!

Whoa.

I like what you've done with the place.
This wasn't me.


"Ziggy is a witch bitch."

"Ziggy sucks cocks in Hell." Jeez.

Sheila?

Colonel Mustard.

Oh, looks like blood.
Yeah. I didn't have a pig, soâ€¦

<i>Carrie.</i> Cool.

You've read <i>Carrie?</i>

Yeah. Second favorite after <i>Salem's Lot.</i>

[Ziggy chuckles]

Still, I dunno,
paint seems a little pedestrian.

Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have a better idea?

Maybe.

Shouldn't you be, like,
turning me in or something?

Well, I should be supervising
Color War, uhâ€¦

But noticed you were MIA and...
So you decided to stalk me.

Check in on you.

Clearly you don't need my assistance.
All good. Go ahead.

"Carrie" on.

What's your idea?

[keys jingling]

Science & Nature.


Alice!

Come on, it's disgusting in here!

Berman, hang in there!

This was the best idea.

Yeah, but I still don't feel shit.

OK, so, take more.

Thank you.

L484.

[Alice] Arnie!
[Arnie] Wait up!


I swear to Godâ€¦ [gasps]

Shit!

Oh, it's ruined now!
You cursed again.

You want me to murder you?

Babe, you OK?
[Tommy] Yeah.

Yeah, I'm fine. [sniffs]

[Alice screams]


[suspenseful music playing]

Watch your step.



Mary.

Hey, where's the, uhâ€¦

The X's, look. Look.

Look, here. Here.

She was marking where she dug.


her grip on the land holds firm

and the curse will last
until body and hand unite."

Maybe Mary was looking for the hand.

To end the curse?
That made her daughter lose her mind.

Guys, come on.

[scoffs] This is silly.
[Arnie] Yeah.

I gotta piss.

Hey, let me see that.

You can have it,

but first give me the drugs.


L484,

L4â€¦

[urine falling]
â€¦84.

[menacing music playing]

If Nurse Mary took them and went crazy,
those drugs are very dangerous.


What happened to you?

You remember when we used to have fun?

Before you became a snitch?
Just let it go already.

That's easy for you to say.

You lying fucking Brutus.
[Arnie] I found it!

I found the witch's house.

[suspenseful music playing]
[Alice and Arnie laughing]

Dudeâ€¦

Was I the only one expecting, like,
I dunno, a house made out of candy?


[menacing music playing]

[Alice laughing]

Whoa!
[Alice gasps, laughs]

[Alice and Arnie laughing]

Hey, Sarah,
you got any candy down there? [laughing]

We're high and hungry.

Sarah Fier!
OK, we've seen enough.

Alright then, go home, Berman.

I didn't march all the way out here
for nothing, OK?

[Alice laughing]
Are you crazy? Alice!

Alice!


Like, recently.



It's Sarah Fier!

Sarah Fier isn't real.

Well, someone lit that candle.

Hey, Sarah Fier, if you're in here,
say something!

Maybe she's shy.

[Alice chuckles]

Aliâ€¦ Alice! God!

[Tommy exhales deeply]

[dramatic music playing]

Whoa!

It's some kind of, like, occult thingâ€¦

Like Devil worship.

[Alice] It's kinky.
[Arnie] Oh, yeah.

[Alice laughing]
It's the witch's mark.

The what?


"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand
on Satan's stone

in exchange for eternal life,

scarring the soil beneath
with the witch's mark,

bringing Darkness upon the land."


It's acetaminophen.

Arnie, what are you talking about?
[Arnie] L484.

It just hit me. It's fucking Tylenol.
It's nothing.

Are you sure?

Positive.

Let's get out of here.

Pretty sure Joan might still have
some weed if we pay her.


[fly buzzing]

[fly buzzing]

[Arnie groans]


Let's go, man.

[indistinct whispering voice]

Hey, you alright, man?

Hello?

I need to show you something.
This placeâ€¦

It keeps on going.
Now!


Billy Barker. Ruby Lane.

Mary's daughter.
Yeah.

Isaac Milton, Harry Rooker.

You don't have to go to fucking class
to know those names.

The Shadyside Killers.
Yeah.

Except one.

Tommy? Alice, this isn't funny.

What, you think I carved your boyfriend's
name into solid stone with my fingernails?

Someone else did this.



[indistinct whispering voices]

thanks for sharing.

Dick.
[Tommy groans]

[indistinct whispering voices]


What the hell are you doing, man? Tommyâ€¦


Tommy, stop!

[both screaming]

[Cindy] Come on! Come on!
[Alice] Fuck!

[both gasping]

Here.

Help me.

Go, go, go!

He's still alive?

He can'tâ€¦ He can't get us.

He can't get us.

Who are you?

Nick Goode.

Nice to meet you.


I don't know. It seems to justâ€¦

go on forever.




help me?

What, you're just gonna pretend
that everything's OK?

[Cindy breathing heavily]

Alice, I justâ€¦

Tommy split Arnie's head in half.

Do you realize that?

[sobbing] Please, can you just help me?
With what?

This shit weighs, like, a million pounds.
I thought you got an A in physics.

We have to get out!

Well, tough shit.

Because we can't.

We're gonna die down here.

Just like Arnie.

[menacing music playing]

No, no. We have to get out!

We have to!

Those names on the wall,
they didn't stop with one murder.

Seven, nine, ten, fifteen people.

Those were serial killers.

The campersâ€¦

Myâ€¦ my sister, they're up there.

And now, so is he.

I thought you didn't believe in the witch.

Yeah, I don't! Iâ€¦

Theâ€¦ There must be someâ€¦ some explanation.

you are fucking unbelievable, Cindy. OK?

He was possessed!

Maybeâ€¦ Maybe he took a pill or...
No!

No! Cindy, no!
It wasn't the fucking Tylenol, alright?

It was the witch.

Alright, you saw those names.

And thatâ€¦ that ritual,

the witch is real.

And she's doing someâ€¦
some fucking spell shit

and possessing people.

OK? Every name on that rock.

And Mary knew it, alright?

She knew it. And it's all right here.

This isn't real!

You want an explanation?

Well, here it is. OK?

She looked for the hand bone
to fucking stop the curse,

to save Shadyside,
but she couldn't find it.

Wanna know what she did find?

Your boyfriend's name
in that fucking wall.


So she tried to kill him.
Stop.

Which I also would've done,

if I knew there was a chance
that Tommy fucking Slater

would ax my boyfriend in the fucking head!

Listen! Shut up!


That's the Cindy Berman I knew.

Hey, where are you going?

To find another way out.

Don't follow me.

Don't come back here, alright?

Don't come back!

[breathing heavily]

[whispering voice] <i>Cindyâ€¦</i>


You're fine, you're fine.


[Cindy gasps]

Jesus, what the hell?
I told you not to follow me.

Yeah, I didn't.

You went in a circle.

Fucking circle.

[Alice laughing]

[Alice laughing]

[suspenseful music playing]

One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

What are you doing?
Four.

This symbol, it branches off here.
Four times.

Three there, one there.

Just like this cave.

It's the same.

"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand
on Satan's stone,

scarring the soil beneath
with the witch's mark."

"Scarring the soil."

So, what, like, the witch
made this fucking place?

Or the settlers claimed she did.
It doesn't matter.

All that matters is this symbol. It's a...
It's a map.

[menacing music intensifies]

[indistinct whispering voices]

Can I, uhâ€¦ get you a water
or a juice box maybe?

We're fine.

Cool. Yeah, I just thought, you know,
since we're all in here and in jail

that you might want
some refreshments, but, uhâ€¦

Or we can, uhâ€¦ We canâ€¦ We canâ€¦
Well, we can play a game.

Do you guys like, uh, Charades...

Shut the fuck up, nerd.

Yeah, OK. Sure. Umâ€¦

these inmates are property of Shadyside.

Manâ€¦ [groans]




[high-pitched shrill]

Tommy?

[menacing music intensifies]

[Jeremy screams]
[thud]

[Tommy grunting]

Alright, next question.

Uhâ€¦
["Sweet Jane" playing over stereo]

What about you and your sister?
You guys ever get along?

Thought these were supposed to be
easy questions.


There are no rules to this game.

God, I hate snakes.

Why are you dodging my question?

Why do you care?

I'm curious.

I've hated her since I was a baby. Next.
[Nick] Come on.

Why are you so full of shit?


Nick Goode,

heir apparent,

Daddy was the police chief,
the King of Sunnyvale,

you're gonna be the same.

Except it's all make-believe.

The truth is you like Stephen King
and spiders andâ€¦

the weird girl from Shadyside.

Alright, first of all,

Stephen King is, like, super popular.

And, second,

I can't like the weird girl.

Why not?

Because I'm a counselor.

She's a camper.

Last year for me. First year for you.

Plus, how will I ever get to know her
when she keeps dodging my questions?

There was a time
when things were good between us.

When my dad was around
and my mom was happy,

and my sister and me, we would, umâ€¦

we'd throw toilet paper
on Mr. Corkle's tree,

and then go jump in the lake
in all our clothes andâ€¦

And nowâ€¦

Now it's just gone and everything's shit.

That's what happens
when you live in Shadyside.

Everything turns to shit eventually.

[sentimental music playing]

But I wouldn't expect
a Sunnyvaler to understand.

No, maybe you're right.

But, uhâ€¦ being the heir apparent
isn't always easy either.

Before he died,

my dad loaded me up with all this,

you know, "You're my legacy,

the future of the family
depends on you" shit.

You know, he just dropped
this huge burden in my lap andâ€¦

I dunno, what if I don't want that?

What if that's not who I want to be?

What if I want to be the kid
who likes spiders and Stephen King and...

And the weird girl from Shadyside?

Yeah.

[sentimental music fades out]

The weird girl from Shadyside.

["Sweet Jane" continues over radio]
But, uhâ€¦

I guess there's nothing I can do about it.

Why not?

â™ª <i>Some people</i>
<i>They like to go out dancing</i> â™ª

Yeah, you were right. Can we, uhâ€¦
Can we go back to the easy questions?

OK.

Umâ€¦

How aboutâ€¦

â™ª <i>Everything is just dirtâ€¦</i> â™ª

Would you ever kiss the weird girl?
â™ª <i>But anyone who ever had a heart</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Oh, they wouldn't turn around</i>
<i>And break it</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Sweet Jane</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Sweet Jane</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Sweet Jane</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Sweet Jane</i> â™ª

[girl screaming]

[crowd screaming]
[boy] He's dead!

[boy] Jeremy's dead!
[man] No, you guys! OK? Hey!

We're done. Everyone get back.
Hey, no! Color War's done! Alright?

Get out of here! Get out!
[Ziggy gasps]


Alright, it branches off again here.
Just stay left.

[Alice gasping]

I cannot believe this is working.

It's taking too long.
He could be back at camp already.

If you have to kill himâ€¦

could you?

Earlier, when Mary attacked, I justâ€¦

I froze. I couldn't do anything.

So, no, Iâ€¦ I couldn't kill anyone,
much less Tommy.

Well, good news. I would happily kill him.

God, even now, after everything,
you'reâ€¦ you're still a jerk.

I never got what you saw in him.

And that was before
the witch possessed him.

Tommyâ€¦ [sighs]

Tommy was sweet.

He made me feel like

everything was going to be OK.

I loved him.

I really did.


I loved that gross, high little shit.
[inhales deeply]

[deep rumbling]

Do you hear that?

There's this space here up ahead.

All roads lead here.

Is there any other way around?

Flies? What is this stuff?

It's everywhere.

What is that?

Go, guys! Go, go!

Five, seven, eight, ten,

fifteen, eighteenâ€¦

[kids screaming]

[Nick] Stay calm! Everything's alright!
How many?

Twenty-three.
That's 30 missing at least.

Where's Cindy, Kurt, Joan?
I don't know. I haven't seen them.

Or Tommy or anyone.

[boy] The lights are coming on!
Maybe they're looking for us.

[Nick] It's dead.
We have to go. We have to warn people.

I'm sure they heard the bell. Hey!
My sister, she's still out there!

The same sister you've hated
since you were a baby?

Look, I'm sorry.

I didn't mean it. Me and Gary will go.

What?
Just please stay here.

I can't sit here!
I'm not letting you get hurt!

[girl] What the hell?
[Nick] OK?

Please, let me do my job.

I'm gonna find your sister.
Just stay here. OK?

[indistinct chatter]

You.
Hey, you realize that's a camper, right?

Look, you make for cabin one.
I'll head to nine.

What if the killer's still out there?
That's the whole point, Gary.

Hey, everybody! Stay here! OK? OK.

[ominous music playing]

Hey!

Where is she, witch?
You kill her like you killed Jeremy?

What are you talking about?
Sheila!

Where the fuck is Sheila?

Shit!

Nick! Nick, we forgot Sheila!

Shit!

Cindy!

Kurt!

Alice!

Joan!

Fuck.

Where the fuck is everyone?

["Slow Ride" playing]
[Joan moaning]

Stay put, big boy.

[Joan moaning]

[Joan screaming]
[Kurt] Oh, yeah. Oh!

â™ª <i>Take it easyâ€¦</i> â™ª

[both moaning]

[Kurt exhales deeply]

You tell anyone about this,
and you're dead.

You hear me?
Yeah.

â™ª <i>Take it easyâ€¦</i> â™ª

Just admit that Shadysiders do it better.


He knows.

â™ª <i>Move to the musicâ€¦</i> â™ª



[high-pitched shrill]

from here! Put it out!

You know, you Sunnyvalers
are really missing out.

This shit, like, reallyâ€¦

opens up your mind.


[ominous music playing]

[music continues over stereo]

[ominous music playing]

[door creaks]

[fly buzzing]

Okie dokie!

Tommy!



[Alice grunting in pain]


Jesus!

[Alice whimpering]

I was there, in the past.

You're OK.
I saw theâ€¦ the killers.

They killed so many and you're next.

You're fucking next!

No, no, no, no.
That's not true. I'm right here.

The witch did this.

She did all of this. She put a curse
on Shadyside. Mary was right.

I know.

The cave was alive, Alice.

Tylenol can't do that.

[giggles, screams in pain]



I am a snitch.

The day after we stole
Mr. Evans's JVC player,

Harold Hines saw me with it.

Fucking Harold Hines.

[pained screaming]

Next thing I know,
I'm in the Principal's office,

and my dad can't come in

because he just ran off with some girl
not much older than I am now.

And my mom, well, she was having
a few drinks at O'Connell's.

And I knew thenâ€¦

I wasn't different
from the other Shadysiders.

I was cursed.

I told myself if I was perfect,

if I did everything right,

I could beat it.

I snitched on you,

I got new friends, Iâ€¦

started dressing like this.

I dated sweet Tommy.

I avoided you,

but I couldn't avoid Ziggy.

Because she was always there,
reminding me of the truth.

That this town, this placeâ€¦ [sniffs]

â€¦was cursed.

And so were we.

Now I know.

She was rightâ€¦

all this time.

[Alice screams]


I've been a bad friend.

I should've justâ€¦

skipped class, partied, had sex, had fun.


but the funâ€¦

it's not any more real
than your polo shirt.

There's a reason I wear these.

And it's not just because they're awesome.

[sighs shakily] We all have our ways
to deal with Shadyside.


[breathing heavily]

This.

This moss, it stained my shirt.
The outhouse!

This stuff is all over the outhouse.

Camp.

It means we're close.

Everyone, listen up! The game is over!

Get back to the Mess Hall
or I'll dock you a victory point!

[twig breaks]

Claire! Freddy! Jesus!

Get to the Mess Hall! Come on! Go!

Everyone, the game is over!


Was that Counselor Goode?

Hey! I said no talking!

He said the game was over!
No talking, dweeb!

Just stay put.
I'll check with Counselor Goode.

Hey, we needâ€¦ that.


Maybe we should just leave.


[ominous music playing]

Counselor Tommy?

[campers screaming]

[ax thudding against bodies]
[knife drawn]

[owl hooting]

[breathing heavily]

Oh shit!

Sheila?

Sheila, are you still in here?

Sheila?

You bitch!
[Ziggy screams]

Sheila! Listen to me!

Do you smell that?


It smells like shit.

Is that toilet paper?
[Cindy] It's the outhouse. It's gotta be.

[Alice] Holy shit.
[Cindy] There it is. Look.


[Sheila and Ziggy grunting, screaming]

I'm trying to help you! There's a killer...


I heard shouting. What's going...?
[Ziggy gasps]

What's going on in here?
Is everyone OK?

No! Everyone's headed back
to the Mess Hall.

Where's Nick?

[muffled screaming]
Help! Help! We're down here! Help!

Do you hear that?

[muffled shouting]


[muffled shouting] Down here!
Please help us!

Please, help us!
Get us out of here!

[now louder] Hey! Hello!
Help us!


Cindy?

Ziggy? Oh my God!

What are you doing down there?
[Cindy] It'sâ€¦

[Cindy panting]

Are you OK?

Yeah, hold on a second.

Ziggy, are you OK?


What is going on?

My sister's in the toilet.
What?

Gary! Just help me!

Come on! Go! Back to the Mess Hall,
you hear me? Let's go!

[menacing music playing]

If anyone's in there, the game's over!

Oh God.

[menacing music intensifies]

Oh shit!




Nick! I came out of the bathroom,
she was just dead, man! I swear to God!

Jesus, man.

Did you do this?

Listen, there's a fucking killer.
What?

We have to get the others out of here.
Get back to the Mess Hall.

In 15 minutes, ring the bell.

Ring the bell, that's the signal.

Get them on the bus,
get them out of here. Alright?

You hear me?

Just go! Go, Kurt!

[menacing music playing]

[Ziggy] Get on! We're pulling you up!
[laughing] Yes!

[Alice] Dude, oh my God.
Pull it. You first.

[rope creaks]

Now!

[both grunting]

[Alice grunting]



[door creaks open]

Tommy! Tommy, what are you doiâ€¦



[Cindy and Alice screaming]




[Cindy] Ziggy!
[Alice] Get him off!

Ziggy! Ziggy!
Get him off me!

[Alice] Get him off! Get him off!
Ziggy!

[Ziggy gasps]

What are you doing?

He's here!
Come on!

Did we lose him?
Yeah, I think so. Are you OK? You hurt?

It's not my blood. It's Gary's.

And yours?
Umâ€¦ Sean, Jesse, Rod, Stacey.

Shadysiders. It's the curse.

No, it's, uh, it's just some psycho.

No, no, it's not some psycho. It's Tommy.

My sister's perfect, virgin,
boring boyfriend Tommy.

She did this.

[Nick] Cindy?
The witch!

That's not real, Ziggy.

Exactly whatÂ Sunnyvaler would say.
I thought you were different.

[bell ringing]

They're getting on the bus. We have to go!

I can't! My sister is still out there!
Ziggy, I've let a lot of people die.

Nick, this isn't your fault.
Not you! I'm not letting you die.

Because, uhâ€¦ yeah!

I do like the weirdo from Shadyside.

Maybe once we get out of this,

we could, uhâ€¦
we could start a book club or something.

Maybeâ€¦ I dunno, Stephen King's new one
is supposed to be good, I hear.

I'm done with King.
Judy Blume for me from now on.

Yeah, Judy Blume sounds, uhâ€¦
sounds perfect.

You believe me, right? About the curse?

Yeah, of course. I am different.

Now, come on. We gotta get out of here.

We'll call the cops.
Your sister's gonna be alright.

First, we gotta get on that bus.

Run!

Ziggy! [panting]

Ziggy!

We have to find another way out.

What if there's not?


We're at the outhouse. We're at camp.

Come on, get the diary. We're too close.

OK, theseâ€¦ these tunnels.

The witch, she made them, right?

Yeah?

And, "She emerged by the Meeting House,

one hand severed lost forever."

The Meeting House, which is nowâ€¦

The Mess Hall.

There's gotta be another way out.

Oh God!

Come on!

I'm just gonna slow you down.
Alice!

No, it's fine. I'll catch up.
You gotta save your sister.

Noâ€¦

Go!

Kurt! Will! Anybody!

It's becoming a habit.


[both sobbing]


You smell like shit.

Yeah, that's because I'm covered in it.
Oh God.

Do you think it'll wash out?
You might need to buy a new polo.

[both chuckling]

I'm so sorry, Ziggy.

I'mâ€¦ I'm sorry I wasn't here,
not just tonight, but every day.

No, you were. You just...


I know that now.

I know that you just needed me
to listen, to hear you.

I thought if I just put my head down
and followed the rules,

everything would be fine,

that I'd get out of Shadyside, butâ€¦

but now I know you were right.

Everything is cursed.

I could have been nicer.

I could have been less of aâ€¦ of a monster.

Yeah. Wellâ€¦

You were my monster.

And at the end of the day, Mom, Dadâ€¦

Shadyside, Sunnyvale, Iâ€¦

I won't let anything pull us apart again.

You hear me?

Loud and clear, ma'am.

[Alice grunts]

Hey, snitch!

What took you so long?

[Alice grunting]


[Alice grunting]

[Alice chuckles]

You did it.

We did it.

OK, careful, OK?
This thing's like a million years old.

I bought that a month ago.

No, I'm not talking
about your stupid bag, genius.

"Blood will fall."

Satan's stone, OK? It was right there.

All this time, buried under the moss,
and I found it.

I fucking found it.

Found what?

Three guesses.

[ominous music playing]

What? What is it?



she spent her entire life
looking for this.

A way to stop the curse
that took her daughter.

"Without her hand,
her grip on the land holds firm."

"The curse will last

until body and hand unite."

This led us to the hand bone.

And if the legend is true,
that means her body's still buried...

By the Hanging Tree.

We can end this.

No more murders, no more curse,

no moreâ€¦

pain.

We can save Shadysideâ€¦

tonight!




I bled on the hand andâ€¦

I think I just saw her.

Who?

Sarah Fier.


She was angry.

We have to bury this thingâ€¦
right fucking now.

[dramatic music playing]


[flies buzzing]


[dramatic music intensifies]

[ominous drumbeat]

[breathing heavily]

[fly buzzing]


What, I have to use my hands?

No, you're staying here.

Come on, I can hop just fine.

I watched my dad go to jail
when I was six.

I watched my mom stealâ€¦

so I could eat.

First time I cut myself I was 12.

It was afterâ€¦

Well, you know when.

And now tonightâ€¦

I watched your perfect boyfriend

turn into a monster

and kill the only person I've ever loved.

my whole fucking life for this.

And now I've found it.

Let me see this through.

For Arnieâ€¦

for Tommyâ€¦

for Shadyside.

[dramatic music playing]

For Shadyside.

For Shadyside.

Alice!


[Cindy grunting]

Fucking die!

Why won't you fucking die!




No! Alice?

Alice?

Alice, justâ€¦

Just stay with me. Alice.


[breathing stops]


Alice!

Alice!

[Ruby] â™ª <i>You always hurt</i> â™ª

[Ruby] â™ª <i>The one you love</i> â™ª
Run, run!

[Ziggy screams]
Ziggy!

Help me!

[dramatic music playing]



[Ziggy] Here?
[Cindy] Yes!


[Cindy grunting]


Just keep digging!

[Ziggy grunting]

[Ruby] â™ª <i>You always hurt</i> â™ª
[Cindy] Faster!




The witch forever lives.

The witch forever lives.

[breathing heavily]

Cindy, what does it mean? Cindy?
I don't know.

Where is she? Where's the body?
I don't know.

This way. Come on!

[both scream]


[ominous music intensifies]

â™ª <i>You always hurt</i> â™ª

What do you want, Sarah Fier?

You want this? You can have it!

Just let my sister live!
Just let my sister live!


They're after you.

Get ready to run.

No, Cindy, no! No, Cindy!
Let's go!

[dramatic music crescendos]

[Ziggy screams]

[Cindy roars]

No!

No!

[tragic music playing]







[tragic music playing]
[moans]


[gasping] Never again.
[ax thudding]

[thunder rumbles]


[soft melancholic music playing]


<i>Five thousand, nine hundred
and thirty-seven days ago.</i>

<i>My sister was deadâ€¦</i>

<i>and so was I.</i>


["The Man Who Sold The World" playing]

No! Hey, hey!

Don't die on me, OK?

[breathing heavily]


Come on, come on, come on!

â™ª <i>Which came as some surprise</i>â€¦ â™ª

Come on. Come on!

â™ª <i>I spoke into his eyes</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I thought you died alone</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>A long, long time ago</i>â€¦ â™ª

Breathe.


â™ª <i>Oh no</i>â€¦ â™ª


â™ª <i>I never lost control</i>â€¦ â™ª



â™ª <i>With the man who sold the world</i>â€¦ â™ª
[gasping]


Wait, you're Ziggy?

Look at me. What's your name?


Ziggy.


Her real name, it's Christine Berman.

â™ª <i>I searched for form and landâ€¦</i> â™ª

Where's myâ€¦ Where's my sister?

â™ª <i>â€¦years I roamed</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I gazed a gazeless stareâ€¦</i> â™ª


<i>my sisterâ€¦</i>

<i>She sacrificed herself for nothing.</i>

I told everyone the story of how she died.

The story I just told you.

And no one believed me.

â™ª <i>We never lost controlâ€¦</i> â™ª

And Nick?


Sarah Fier, the witch.

The curse, it'sâ€¦

it's real.


<i>I thought he would believe me.</i>

<i>But Nick had a destiny in this town.</i>

<i>And you don't become sheriff
talking about ghost stories.</i>

â™ª <i>We never lost controlâ€¦</i> â™ª

What the hell happened here?

Tommy Slater.
â™ª <i>With the man who sold the worldâ€¦</i> â™ª

He just went crazy.




Not after that.


<i>The town curseâ€¦</i>

<i>For one night, Cindy believed
that there was a way to end it.</i>

<i>So I thought there was too.</i>

<i>But now I knowâ€¦</i>

there is no end.

[alarm clock buzzing]

Like I said, your best chance
is to run from this place.

Go as far as you can, hope a bus
doesn't hit you on the way out.

We found the body

off Highway 5 in the woods
between Shadyside and Sunnyvale.

It's not possible.


The chains, the bones, the whole thing.

That could be anyone.

Why do you think our friends died?

For the same reason they killed Alice,
your sister.

The killers came after us because we found
something they didn't want us to find.

And I wish to God that it never happened,

but we found it.

We found what you were looking for in '78.

We found Sarah Fier.

Look, please, weâ€¦ Nurse Lane was right.

We can end the curse
by reuniting the hand with the body.

And we know where the body is,
so all we need is the hand.

What happened to Camp Nightwing?
Is the hand bone still there?

Is it still buried
underneath the Hanging Tree?

Sheriff Goode.



<i>Says it's an emergency.</i>

<i>Says that you two used to be
in a Judy Blume book club together?</i>

<i>Is that a real thing, boss?</i>

<i>Hey, uhâ€¦ Nicky, you there?</i>

Yeah, I'll take care of it.

[tires screeching]

[engine revving]

[ominous drum beating]

Lock the doors.
No, I'm coming with you!

No! You're not.
[Josh] Deenaâ€¦

Your nose is bleeding.

[indistinct voices whispering]

I'll be right back.

Wait. Deena! Deena!

[breathing heavily]

I got youâ€¦

you witch.


It's over.

Sarah Fier!
