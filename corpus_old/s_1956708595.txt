[music playing]

So, tell me
again why I'm here.

Neighbors
complained, said they

heard crying and screaming.

Seems like it could
be an ongoing thing.

What do you
think, child abuse?

Could be.
That's why I'm here.

That's not a good sign.


This is Detective Jordan of theDyer's Bay Police Department.

I'm here with child services.

Open up.

Were coming in.

After you.

Hello.

Anybody home?

I think I like
the office better.

This is nothing.

Get out!
Get off!

All right, freeze, lady.

Stay down.

Get out of my house.

Don't you dare take my
family away from me.

You get out!

Check out the
rest of the house.

There could be a child in here.

This is Jordan.

I'm on a domestic.

I have a situation.

I need backup now!

[door creaks]

[object hits ground]

Oh, God.

OK, OK.

[door creaks]

[music intensifies]

Oh my God.

[music playing]

MUSIC: Locked in this cage,in my mind, all alone.

You held the key,
over me, but a lie.

Stop doing that.

We have to get up.

Come on.

First meeting's not until 10:00.

That's great.

It'll give us plenty of time totalk about options for sitters.

Not now.

We have to hire someone.

I hear someone.

Good morning.

Is someone going
to make breakfast,

or are we all going
to starve to death?

Oh, you are such a
little drama queen.

That's me.

You.

Oh, stop it, stop it.

Here's the spot.
Get some breakfast--


Here's the spot.

Max, you're late.

Any chance you could
take the kids to school?

I have to be at work at 8:30.

Besides, you don't haveto be anywhere till 10:00.

All right.

Let's get a move on, then.

Oh, don't forget--

I know, I know.

We're interviewing
a sitter tonight.

[school bell]

How come you drove us
to school and not mommy?

Because, buddy, mommy's
working, remember?

I know, but why?

Because mommy
wanted more money.

Casey.

We used to have more money.

What happened?

Ah, Max.

I'm five years old.

I have a lot to learn.

You know, I've only
been back a few days,

but it doesn't seem
like anything's changed.

Except maybe the ads, whichhave progressively gotten

worse, if that's possible.

OK, Meghan, I've known
you since rush week.

What's wrong?

I think Carter's
a little upset at me

for coming back to work.

There, I said it.

So, if he would havepaid more attention to what

was going on around
him at his old firm,

you wouldn't have had to.

There, I said it.

Shawna, why is it
so hard to be married?

Don't ask me.

I got divorced for a reason.

My husband took off
with a 19-year-old.

[phone rings]

This is Meghan.

Mrs. Eastman.

It's Mrs. Berry, Max's teacher.

Mrs. Berry, what
can I do for you?

I think you should come
down here, Mrs. Eastman.

Is Max all right?

Max is fine.

He's been disrupting
class again, though.

How disruptive could he be?

He got into the glue again.

When can I expect you?

I'll be right there.

[phone ringing]

Olson residence.

Mel, it's Meghan.

Would you mind watching
Max for a little while

until Carter gets
home from work?

Of course.Bring him right over, sweetie.

Thanks.

I'll be right over.

Bye.

Max.

Do you want to tell me whyyou put glue in Susan's hair?

Max?

Mommy has to work now duringthe days, you understand that?

So I can't keep running
down here every time

you feel like acting up.

But I miss you.

Give it some time?

OK.

Oh, honey.

Come on.

Come on.

So what do you think?

Well, it sounds
like it will be OK.

I think that's what
you're looking for.

Great, thanks.
Stan.

Sir.

Really is good to see you.

Likewise.

So I understand
you'll be bringing

a little business our way?

As a matter of fact, I am.

Good.

Listen, Carter, I want youto see the account right away.

Just tell me when.

How about tomorrow?

CARTER: Your office?

Sounds great.

CARTER: Yes.

Thank you.

STAN: Bye, Ted.

BYE, Stan.

[door closes]

Yes.

Talk about the nick of time.

Abby's going to
be here any minute.

I know, I'm hurrying.
Who's Abby?

She's a sitter.

She's coming for dinner.

Sitter as in babysitter?

I don't like the sound of that.

Just relax, buddy.

I hope she's nice.

Me too.

I just don't want her
to think we're crazy.

Don't worry, mom.

I'm not that crazy.

Don't worry, we'll be good.Right, Max?

Right.
Yeah.


I'll get it.

[music playing]

Hi, I'm Abby.

What's your name?

Casey Eastman.

My, Casey, you're so pretty.

I get it more from
my mom than my dad.

You can come in if you want.

Dinner's almost ready.

OK.

So Abby, why don't you tellus a little bit about yourself?

Well, let's see, I graduatedfrom Santa Cruz last spring,

and I moved down
here soon after,

and I've been doing
some babysitting jobs

to pay the bills ever since.

I'm not a baby.

Of course you're not a baby.

That's just a figure of speech.

I'll bet.

Max is our resident skeptic.

You'll get used
to it eventually.

He's a brat.

Casey.

No, I'm not.

He still wets his pants.

I heard you.

Well, she's certainly
prettier than I thought.

Really?

I hadn't noticed.

You know, for a lawyer,
you're a terrible liar.

I mean it.

I liked her, and I'm hardlybasing that on her looks

at all.

The kids seemed to like her.

You got my vote.

Move her in.

Great.

I will start cleaning
out your so-called gym,

and I will have her
move in next week.

And maybe you could fixthe drain in our bathroom,

because I'm tired of
sharing with the kids.

Yes, dear.

It'll be weird, you know,having a stranger live with us.

It's a little late
for that now, isn't it?

I'm just saying.

Big day, huh?

She's cute, right?

You bet your ass.


I just can't believe
how lucky you were

to find a sitter so quickly.

I know, you talk about
being in the right place

at the right time.

Oh, and don't
forget, t-minus three

weeks and counting
till the biggest

barbecue to end all barbecues.

Jeez, you'd think it
was the second coming.

It is a barbecue, Del.

See, women just
don't understand.

Men need to grill meat.

It's instinctive.

MEL: He's so full of it.

MEGHAN: And here she is.

ABBY: This is so beautiful.

Thank you so much.

It's so nice of you
to do that for me.

I want you to meet
Mel and Del Olson.

They live next door.

MEL: Hi, welcome to
the neighborhood.

DEL: Welcome to
the neighborhood.

Nice to meet you both.

DEL: Nice to meet you.

Let's get your
stuff inside, OK?

All right.

I'll get your bags.

About face.

Hi.

You can have it if you want.

I'll tell you what,
sweetie, why don't

you go finish it up for me, OK?

OK.

Come on.

This is really nice up here.

Thank you.

This is Max's room.

This is mine and Carter'sroom, and here's the bathroom.

This is my room.

You can come see it
whenever you like.

And this is going
to be your room.

Everything's new.

Carter set this room is a gym,but then never set foot in it.

I'll let you get settled.


I'll get that.

Thanks.

You all settled in?
Yes, thank you.

Good.

Carter, I'm terribly sorryabout displacing your gym.

Oh, that's all right.

I'm really haven't beenusing it that much anyway.

You look like
you use it a lot.

Hi, I made some brownies.

The kids are
going to love those.

You must be Abby.
I'm Shawna.

Hi, Shawna.
Hi.

You want some coffee?

Yes, please.

Meghan sure is happy tohave some help around here.

Amen to that.

Thank you.

So Abby, where are you from?

Up north.

Your family still up there?

It's just me.

I was an only child, and myparents died when I was seven.

You poor thing.

Alone at seven.

Casey's seven.

Well, seems things haveturned out all right for you,

all things considered.

Yeah.

I spent some time with areally nice foster family,

and I worked my way through
college by babysitting,

which kind of led me here.

That's great.

Well, I'd love to stayand chat with the ladies,

but I have a date tonight
and I have to get a wax.

Watch Shawna, shedoesn't pull any punches.

Come on, I'll walk
you to the door.

OK, nice to meet you.
You, too.

SHAWNA: Call me after your date.

I want details.

She's great.

MEGHAN: Isn't she?

And Casey loves her already.

Well, you made
the right choice.

I'm so glad to
hear you say that.

She's got quite the
little bod on her, too.


Yeah, I do.

All right, I'll
see you tomorrow.

Bye.

Bye.

I'll talk to you later.

[ominous music]

This is such a pretty street.

Isn't it?

That's where my friend
Jenny used to live,

but she doesn't
live there anymore

because her mom got tired ofher dad always going to Las

Vegas with his secretary.

That's too bad.

Oh, that's where I saw Mr.Monroe kissing Mrs. Sorensen.

Wow.

And then that house wayback there is where I saw

Mr. Miller kissing Mr. Bruger.


Casey.

I'll say.

Oh, Abby, this is Tom.

He lives next door.

Oh, Hi, Tom.

Nice to meet you, Abby.

What are you doing, Tom?

Why are you being so nice?

No reason.

Just riding my bike.

Abby's too mature
for you, Tom.

Bye, Tom.

Casey, I think you might
have hurt his feelings.

He'll get over it.

[music playing]

Thomas!

ABBY: Just a minute.


Hi, Mel.

Hello, Abby.

I'd like to have a word withyou for a moment, if I could.

Sure.

I have to go pick up Max andCasey from school in a minute.

What's up?

Well, in case
you hadn't noticed,

our son Tom is
only 15 years old.

And my husband and I wouldreally appreciate it if you--

if you didn't undress in frontof your open bedroom window.

Oh my god.

I had no idea.

Have you spoken
to Tom about this?

I can assure you he's wellaware of our disappointment.

I'm sure he is.

Well, like they say,
boys will be boys.

You know, I neverreally liked that saying.

Anything else
I can do for you?

I guess not.

Great.

I have to go pick up the kids.

[music playing]

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

There you go.

[party chatter]

How are you doing?

We're good.

We're just gonna have a littlecooking lesson over here.

Hello.

CASEY: Chef Abby.

We're gonna start
with a little tomato.

CASEY: Tomato.
There you go.

Check out my
neighbor's new sitter.

Whoa.

She's hot.

You talk to her yet?

Sure.

Yeah right.

Come on.

All right, to Abby.

Glad you could make it.

Thank you, partner.

Mr. Walker.

Mr. Olson, go to see you.

These are for you.
Thank you.

Well, that one's for me.

All right.

All right, enough chit chat.

Where is she?

She is right over there.

Whoa, hottie.

How old?

She is too young
for you, you lech.

There's no such thing.

No such thing.

Abby, come on over here.

I'd like you to
meet Tate Walker.

He's an old friend of
mine from law school.

Abby, I've heard
so much about you

I feel like I know you already.

Nice to meet you, Mr. Walker.

Pleasure is all
mine, and call me Tate.

OK, Tate.

So I understand you
went to Santa Cruz?

Well, I hate to admit it, butmy baseball team used to beat

the hell out of you guys.

Yeah, we pretty much sucked,but I was more of an Extreme

Frisbee kind of girl.

I believe that.

So, how do you like
Carpenter Falls?

I like it just fine.

And how's the Eastman
household treating you?

I love it.

She loves it.

Well, if you ever stop lovingit, I'm just a phone call away.

She is fine, you big lech.

My best friend.

Exactly.

Thanks a lot.

You're doing OK?
Yeah.

School was fun?

What the hell?

Max.

Max.

Who was that boy?

His name is Conrad Lucas.

He does it everybody.

I don't care.
Go over to Casey.

Max, are you OK?

Hi.

ABBY: Hey!

I want to talk to you.


What did you say to him?

Nothing much.

Come on, let's go home.


Hey.

Wait for me over there, guys.

You threatened my kid?

I spoke to Conrad, yes.

Where do you get offtalking to my kid like that?

Conrad pushed Max
a number of times,

and apparently
this happens often.

Kids play rough sometimes.

So do I.

Now listen--

No, you listen.

The next time your littlebastard goes near Max,

I'm gonna skin him like arabbit, right in front of you.

Got it?

And I mean it.

What's the matter, Case?

Multiplication tables suck.

Casey said "suck."

Thank you, Max,
but so did you.

OK, let me see.

It's not so bad.

Look with the fives--
Hi, mom.

Hi.

Hi, mom.

Hey, what you doing?

Multiplication tables.

Let me get changed, andI'll come back and help you.

That's all right, mom.

Abby's helping me.

I was stuck on five times nine.

MEGHAN: Excuse me.

Hi.

Hey, it's me.

Good news, they settled.

Let's go out and celebrate.

That's nice.

It's better than
nice, it's great.

Are you on your way home?

Let's go out.

Not yet.

I'm having drinks
with some clients.

It might be awhile.

Carter?

It's fine.

You need to do it.

All right.

I'll see you tonight.

[music playing]

Guess I'll celebrate myself.

Celebrate what?

Oh, hey, Abby.

Just a little victory.

Got everything we askedfor in a nice settlement.

Where are the kids?

Upstairs.

So, is this case a
big deal or something?

I guess you could say that.

More of a personal
victory, really.

What do you mean?

You see, I used to bea lawyer with a big firm.

A big firm what?


That's a good one.

Sorry.

So, do you like being a lawyer?

I like it when it'sgood, but I guess you could

say that about any job, right?

Are things good now?

Things are very good.

When did you know you
wanted to be a lawyer?

Ever since I can remember.

Law school was no
picnic, but I managed

to get a job in the publicdefender's office right

after I passed the BAR.

I worked there for a couple ofyears, and then a buddy of mine

from law school, hebrought me into his firm,

and it happened to bethe biggest firm in town.

Worked my ass off, madepartner by the time I was 32.

Then the roof caved in.

What do you mean?

Well, some of my
other partners, they

weren't such good guys.

What did they do?

They ripped off somevery rich clients of ours.

And what happened?

A couple of them
went to jail, and I

found myself out of a job.

But I started over.

Tate and I started
up our own firm,

and today is sort of a
turning point for us.

Wow, congratulations.

I will have thecontracts messengered over

in the morning.

All right, see
you later, Meghan.

Good night, everybody.

You should celebrate.

I should.

What about throwing a party?

A party?

Sure.

We could throw a cocktail party.

It would be fun.

Maybe.

I might have to talk
to Meghan about it.

She might be too
busy to organize it.

Although it sounds
like a great idea.

Well, you always
have me, you know?

I am getting old, Abby.

No, you're not.

I mean, we all get
old, but that doesn't

mean we have to feel old.

How's that feel?

Wow, that feels great.

See?

You're not old.

You're just carrying
around a lot of stress

on your shoulders.

I can feel it.

Can you feel that?

Yeah.

That's the stuff.

Thanks, Abby.

That's exactly what I needed.

[ominous music]

Does your mommy
ever tuck you in?

Sometimes, but she's
usually too tired.

That's OK.

I'll tuck you in everynight, if you want me to.

Yes, please.

Wait, don't go yet.

Somebody has school tomorrow.

Are you going to stay with us?

I'll stay as long
as you want me to.

Then I don't want
to ever leave us.

Then I never will.

Good night, sweetie.

Wait, Abby?

Thanks for sticking up forMax with that jerk Conrad.

Any time.

How was the meeting?

Drunk marketing guys, justmy idea for a fun evening.

Did you say
goodnight to the kids?

Yes, I did.

Max was his usual orneryself and Casey was out cold.

What did you do to her?

Nothing, she playedall night long with Abby.

What do you think about throwing
a little cocktail party?

I'm not gonna havemuch time to organize it.

This campaign is kind ofa big deal for the agency,

not to mention me.

This isn't about who hastime to organize the party.

Yes it is.

You going to do it?

Maybe I will.

ABBY: Casey and Max,
breakfast is ready.

Morning, Meghan.

Morning.

Can I get you some breakfast?

No, just--

I'm gonna have some coffee.

Carter, I made
you some coffee.

Thanks.

I have to get to the
office, I'm late.

Talk to you all tonight.

Carter and I were
talking last night,

you know, about his case, andwe were thinking, what if we

threw a party to celebrate?

Party, huh?

You think so?

Definitely.

I just know how importantthis is to Carter.

I think it'd be
really good for him.

Maybe you're right.

I'd be happy to organize it.

After all, I have plenty of timewhile the kids are at school.

You know, I'll think about it.

Casey, Max, come on,you guys, it's time to go.

[party music]

[party chatter]

Hey.

Having a nice time?

Sure, this is fun.

Looks like everybody showed up.

Everybody loves free booze.- How about you?

Are you having a good time?

Yeah, sure.

What's not to like?

It's a nice day, plenty
of burgers and beer, not

to mention a yard full
of the prettiest girls

in Carpenter Falls, presentcompany included, of course.

Carter.

Stan, so glad
you could make it.

I wouldn't miss it.

By the way, this is Sarah.

Hey Sarah, nice to meet you.

And this is for you.

Oh.

An '82, wow.

I don't know what to say.

It's the least I could do.

Well, thank you.

You're welcome.

Where's Meghan?

Oh, she's around
here somewhere.

Well, we'll go say hi.

OK, great.

All right, there aremore drinks on the patio.

The dress is great.
Thank you.

Hey.
Hey buddy.

Counselor.

How are you?
Great.

Verdict's in.

One hell of a party.

But it's time for you
to start enjoying it.

Look, I am going to play host,and you go easy on the beers,

OK?

Hey, you're my
partner, not my boss.

So unbelievable.

You wouldn't believe it.

Yeah, I know.

Hey, darling.

Hey.

So what are we drinking?

We are drinking mojitos.

Oh, nice.
Hit me.

There you go.
Thank you.

Cheers.

Cheers.

So tell me, how's itgoing with you and Meghan

since she's been back to work?

Great.

Couldn't be better.

Huh.

You know what?

I'm gonna get some food
before it's all gone.

You better hurry.
You be good.

OK.

Need a little coffee, there?

No, I'm allergic.

Thanks, pal.

They're all
getting along well.

Hey.

Good, how are you doing?

I'm good.


Come on, let's
get out of here.

Come on, let's go.

ABBY [VOICEOVER]: What
about throwing a party?

I'd be happy to organize it.

After all, I have plenty of timewhile the kids are at school.

I just you know howimportant this is to Carter.

CARTER [VOICEOVER]: You know howimportant it is for my dearest

to see me back in the game.

MEGHAN [VOICEOVER]: Dearest?

What are you, in high school?


Carter?

Well, not quite.

Hi, Tate.

You all right?

Fine.

You're soaked.

Tell me about it.

How long have you
been watching me?

Long enough.

We shouldn't do this.

Yeah, we should.

[music playing]

Carter, yes.

I got a lot more game

than that guy will ever have.

Are you doing him?

What?

It's all right, sugar.

Your secret's safe with me.

No, stop.

Come on, I just want a littleof what Carter's getting.

That's not true.

Right.

Oh, I get it.

You're just a little
tease, aren't you?


I know you are, sugar.

I wonder what Meghan's goingto think about the two of you.

Tate.

Ah!

Abby?

Ah!

Ah!

Ah!

Ah!

[abby giggles]

I'm-- I'm sorry.

I know you are, sugar.

For god sakes.


You're right,
you ain't Carter.


[music playing]

MUSIC: Locked in this cage,in my mind, all alone.

You held the key--

[party music]


Hey, Abby, have you seen Tate?

No.

I can't seem to
find him anywhere.

I did notice him making
good use of the bar.

Tell me about it.

All right.

[soft piano music]

Bitch.

Well, no one's heardfrom Tate since the party.

Should I be worried now?

I can't understand it.

Maybe we went to Vegas.

You know how he gets.

Good point.

It's not like
him to just bail.

It's really weird.

Look at that.

They found a car in the lake.

Wow.

That's not far from here.

REPORTER [ON TV]:
--are not disclosing

the identity of the driver.

Oh no, that looks
like Tate's car.

Are you sure?

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Yes, this is Carter Eastman.

It's the police.

WOMAN: Can you identify thisas the body of Tate Walker?

That's him.

CARTER: Can a windshield
really do that?

It almost took his
head clean off.

Was that Tate?

Yes, it was.

It's a shame, isn't it?

Abby?

Can I speak with you a minute?

It's about your online profile.

Can it wait?

I promised Casey I'd helpher with her homework,

and I just want to
get her going on it.

We'll talk after, OK?

All right.

I can't get over howgood they've been for you.

Well, I guess I justknow how to talk to kids.

So what was your childhood
like before your parents

passed away?

We were a happy family,
just like any other.

Mom, are we a happy family?

We sure are, sweetie.

Especially now
that Abby's here.

Where is she?


Hi, Mel.

You just scared the
dickens out of me.

Sorry, I didn't mean to.

So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

Well, I was looking
at some sitter sites

for a friend of mine at church.

Uh huh.

And I came across
the site that Meghan

said that she found you on.

And, you know, just for the heckof it, I typed your name in,

and the computer came upand said "no profile found."

And I was just wondering,
what does that mean?

Oh, I always take my profileoffline when I accept a job.

Oh.

Is there anything
else you wanted to know?

No, that'll about do it.

OK then.

Bye, Mel.

[door creaking]

So, uh, how do you likeworking for the Eastman's?

I like it fine.

Boy, my mom would kill me ifshe knew I was talking to you.

Yeah, she doesn't seem tocare much for me, does she?

She's a fruitcake when
it comes to strangers.

She keeps looking you
up on the internet

as if she's trying to uncoversome great secret about you.

So my dad's taking me
driving later on today.

Says if I do good, I can
take my test next week.

Good for you, Tom.

Maybe you and I could
go driving sometime?

Yeah, maybe.

Well, I got to go
check on the kids.

Bye.

SHAWNA: Knock, knock.

Hey.

Hi, you ready?

Oh yeah.

Let's do some shopping.

You want to bring the kids?

Should I?
It's cool.

I got them.

You guys go have fun.

Thanks.

Thanks.

Martinis first,
then shoes second.

Meghan didn't want to takeMax and Casey to the mall?

I guess not.

She looked like she coulduse a break, though.

How are you holding up?

I know you must
miss your friend.

It's definitely weird.

Don't be sad, Carter.

I'll be your friend.

How come mommy
didn't come, too?

Because she went shoppingwith Shawna, dummy.

Casey, that wasn't very nice.

You should apologize to Max.

Sorry, Max.
It's OK.

Hey.

What do you guys want
to do about supper?

We'll pick something
up along the way.

After the game, he's driving.

Nice catch.

Well how long
are you gonna be?

Could be a while.

Depends on how good
a driver he is.

I know how to do it.

Hey, just come
back in one piece.

I'll be back
before you know it.


CARTER: Come on, buddy.

Let's go.

Hey, come on.

That's odd.

[phone ringing]

SHAWNA: I hope that's not Abby.

MEL [ON PHONE]:
Meghan, this is Mel.

Listen, when you get home, Ineed to talk to you privately.

It's very important.

So who was it?

Mel.

Sounded weird.

That woman is weird.

I know, but she soundeda different kind of weird.

WOMAN [ON TV]: What's
a comet anyway?

Comets are small bodies
that orbit the sun.

Viewers on Earthrecognize it by the tail.

MACHINE: First unheard message.

MEL [ON MACHINE]: Carter,
Meghan, this is Mel.

I found out some disturbinginformation about Abby,

and I need to talk to bothof you as soon as possible.

WOMAN [ON TV]: --to be
seen with the naked eye.

What's inside?

Leftovers.

MACHINE: Message deleted.

WOMAN [ON TV]: --rocks
and dust have formed

when the planets
and the sun did more

than 4.5 billion years ago.

Many theorists think
that comets delivered

the water to life on Earth.

Comets are loaded withcarbon and essential to life.

In fact, comets are themost carbon-rich material

in the solar system.

What does Wild 2 look like?

Rather wild, really.

Scientists have expected it tobe around with a flat surface

and covered in dark, dusty--

[door creaking]

[ambient music]

[music clicks off]

Mind your own business, bitch.


WOMAN [ON TV]: The
mission designed

to resolve questions about theorigins of the solar system--

[door closes]

--have now added new
questions to the list.

How did hot minerals
from the blistering core

get to the frigid outerregions, or did the minerals

come from other stars?

Maybe comets aren't
quite what we thought.


The Stardust's spacecraftreturned to earth--


Stay for dinner?

I am gonna stay for
dinner, absolutely.

What are we having?

I never know.

Hey, honey.

Hi.

OK, OK, pay attention.

Hi, guys.

How was shopping?

Not too shabby.

Pretty cozy in here.

I'm going to call Mel.

She sounded--

Weird?

Weirder than usual.

[phone ringing]

That's odd.

She never goes anywhere.

Well, now who's
the nosy neighbor?

I'm going to go
see what she wanted.

Want me to come with you?

No, it's OK.
Honey, you OK?

Yeah, yeah.

Well, you need any help?

It's OK.

I got it.


Mel?

Mel?

Mel?

Mel?

Mel?

Mel?

Mel?


Oh god.

Abby, please take the
kids and go upstairs.

But dinner's almost ready.

Just please do it, OK?

Mommy, what's wrong?

Come with me.

What happened?

Oh, Mel's had an
accident and she's dead.

ABBY: It's going to be OK.

Hello?

There's been an accident.

PRIEST: The lord is myshepherd, I shall not want.

He makes me lie down
in green pastures,

he leads me beside stillwaters, he restores my soul,

he leads me in paths ofrighteousness for his namesake.

Even though I walk through thevalley of the shadow of death,

I will fear no evil,
for you are with me.

Your rod and your
staff, they comfort me.

I know that the family
would like to thank you

all for coming, today,
and for your love

and for your support
in this rough time.

It's always difficult to
lose somebody you know.

Her life meant so
much to us all.

Thank you so much for
coming, and for honoring

Mel Olson's life.

Oh hey, don't run, you guys.

Did you see Del?

I've never really
seen him like that.

I still can't
believe she's gone.

And poor Tom.

How are you doing?

I'll be all right.

I'm a bit freaked out.

Aren't you guys?

I mean, nothing happens aroundhere forever, and then two

people die in as many weeks.

And they say it
happens in threes.

That's very
comforting, Shawna.

You know what I mean.

It's just a little odd.

Yeah, it is, but it was
an accident, all right?

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean anything by it.

Listen, I just want
to take the kids home

and I don't really want totalk about this right now.

Can we go?

You know, actually,
can we talk a minute?

I'll take you home.

Yeah, sure.

You guys take as
long as you'd like.

You sure?

I just want to get
out of these clothes

and take a shower.

The drain's clogged again.

Use the kids'.

OK, bye.

See you at home.

Bye, Shawna.

Bye.

So, what's up?

How much do you
know about Abby?

I don't think I likewhere this is going, Shawna.

What do you really
know about her?

Abby's been nothing buta godsend for this family.

I know, I know.

How are Max and Casey
taking everything?

I think they're
doing all right.

Abby's been helping them deal.

Sounds like she's taking over.

Thank you, Shawna.

I needed to hear that.

That's what I'm here for.

Sorry.

[water running]

Thanks.

Don't mention it.

Sorry, I didn't know
anyone was in here.

It's OK.

The kids are finally asleep.

You all right?

MEGHAN: Carter, are
you attracted to Abby?

What kind of question is that?

Don't be defensive.

I'm just curious.

I'm not being defensive.

You're not?

CARTER: Why are we
arguing about this?

Because you won't
answer the question.

This is ridiculous.

MEGHAN: Answer the question.

CARTER: I can't believe thatwe're having this conversation.

Trust me, you're the
only girl for me.

But she's-- she's
so young and pretty.

She is, but she's not you.

MEGHAN: Shawna asked me somestrange questions today.

About what?

Abby.

She asked me how well I knewAbby, and if I trusted her.

What did you say?

I told her Abby's been great.

It did get me thinking.

No, come on, I mean it.

Right before I found Mel
she left me this message

on my voicemail, and
she said that she

had to talk to me right awayabout something important.

Honey, I wouldn't
worry about it.

Shawna's just paranoid.

She's been suspicious ofpeople ever since her divorce.

Is it possible that maybe
you're just jealous?

Jealous?

The kids have really
taken a shine to Abby.

MEGHAN: But do you actuallythink that I'm jealous of Abby?

Meghan, you just askedme if I'm attracted to her.

I know, I just--

I'm going crazy.

I've been thinking that witheverything that's happened

around here that maybe I needto spend some more time at home,

you know, for the kids' sake.

Stan Gable's
little case was nice.

We're set for a while.

Maybe-- maybe the
truth is we don't need

a full-time sitter anymore.

MEGHAN: All right,
well, then tomorrow I

will work from house,
and maybe I'll get

to know Abby a little better.

Tomorrow.

Bring then by any time.

Thanks, Shawna.

Everything cool?

Yep.

I gave Shawna the
heads up, and I

think they'll be able tofunction without me for a day.

Where's Abby?

I saw her this morning.

It's almost time for school.

Don't worry about it.

I told her I'd drop
the kids on the way.

Morning, mom.

Morning.

Come on, you guys.

We gotta go.

All right.
Bye, mom

Bye, bye, I'll see
you guys tonight.

See you later, honey.
Bye.

Bye.

CASEY: I call shotgun.

[car starting]

Abby?

Abby?

Abby?

Abby?

Ugh, oh!

Meghan?

Are you all right?

Please, my boss just
had an accident.

She fell down the stairs.

She's not moving.

Yes.

Yes.

Thank you.

Don't worry, Meghan.

I'll take good care of you.

Knock, knock.

Hey, Meghan, I found
the Fitzgerald file.

Shawna.

Thank god.

Meghan fell.

Hey, Meg.

Can you hear me?

I don't know what happened.

I was in the bathroom,and then I came downstairs

and she was like this.

Meghan, sweetheart.

I already called 911,
they're on their way.

Good.

MEGHAN: Shawna--

Abby.

What happened?

I'm not sure.

She must have tripped
coming down the stairs.

Is she all right?

I think so, but
she's badly bruised

and her ankles are broken.

Shawna's in with her now.

I'll go see her.

Of course.

I'll go pick up Casey and Max.

Good thing you
stayed home today, huh?

Don't make me laugh.

So it's a couple of brokenankles, some cuts and bruises.

I'm sorry.

Honey.

I'll give you
guys a few minutes.

Yeah.

Oh, honey.

How are you doing?

I feel like such an idiot.

Don't say that.

It was an accident.

I know.

I can't believe it.

I was looking for Abby.

I couldn't find
her, and then I--

I guess I tripped, and
the next thing I knew,

she was at my side
and calling 911.

And then Shawna came.

That fall really knocked
the wind out of me.

Abby may have saved my life.

I'll let you get some sleep.

Don't you worry about a thing.

Abby will help out at home.

Damn lucky we have her, huh?

I'll say.

You get some rest.

I'm sure you'll be
home in no time.

[music playing]

Pearson and Weiss.

SHAWNA [ON PHONE]:
Natalie, do me a favor.

I need you to check
on someone for me.

Check on someone?

What are we, a
detective agency now?

SHAWNA [ON PHONE]:
Natalie, just do it.

All right, who?

Find out what you
can on an Abigail Reed.

Abigail Reed.

Got it.

What did she do?

SHAWNA [ON PHONE]: Probablynothing, just let me know when

you find out something, OK?

Will do.

When's mommy gonna be home.

Soon, tiger.

Maybe even tomorrow.

Really?

Really, but only
if you're good.

Now, mommy's going
to need all our help

so she can get better, OK?

OK.

OK.

Do you need anything elsebefore I turn in, Carter?

No thanks.

Well, you know where tofind me if you want me, right?

I sure do.

Good night, then.

Abby.

I don't know what
we'd do without you.

Thank you for taking suchgood care of Meghan, today.

That's why I'm here.

[ominous music]

Carter Eastman.

Hey, Carter.

How's Meghan doing?

Better.

She hates being in the hospital.

Two days is too long for her.

I'll bet.

Do you know when
she can come home?

I'm going to pick
her up after work.

Carter, please don't
think I'm crazy for what

I'm about to say.

No promises.

I don't think you should leaveMeghan alone with Abby again.

You just have to trust me.

You are crazy, Shawna.

It actually feels like Abbyis the one who's keeping

this family together right now.

Carter, please,
just believe me.

Meghan is my friend and I don'twant anything to happen to her.

And she's my wife, Shawna.

Listen.

I have to get back to work.

I'm sure Meghan
would love it if you

come by to see her sometime.

I will.

Bye, Carter.

When's daddy
coming home with mom?

Soon, sweetie.

I hope so, I miss her.

I know you do, Max.

That's daddy's car.

Mommy's home!

BOTH: Mommy!

Look who is here.

Mommy!

OK, all right,
give her some air.

You guys go up and
wash up, all right?

I'll go get dinner started.

We have missed you so much.

I am grateful that
you were able to call

the ambulance so quickly.

Probably made all the
difference in the world.

I did what I had to do.

Well, I can work from home,but I am going to go crazy

sitting in this chair all day.

To mommy coming
home in one piece.

Hear, hear.

And to Abby for being
more than a sitter.

Woo!

Woo!

Cheers.

Cheers.

All right.

Careful, careful.
Ouch.

Oh, sorry, sorry.

It's been a long timesince you carried me to bed.

Well, it would be a
lot more romantic if you

didn't have broken ankles.

Lucky for you, I'm
not an ankle man.

OK.

Abby, I'll drop
the kids off today.

They way, you can
stay with Meghan.

That would be great.
Is she up yet?

No, not yet, but youmight check on her later.

Sure.
Take care of my mom.

Oh, I will.

Let me help you.

I got it.

Thanks.

Is there anything
I can do for you?

You know, a bath
would feel great.

Would you mind
running it for me?

I'd love to.

Do you want any music?

Oh, no.

I'm kind of enjoying the quietwhile the kids are in school,

but thank you.

My pleasure.

[ominous music]

You know, a bath
would feel great.

Pearson and Weiss.

Please have good news.

Well, that depends
on how you look at it.

I found an Abigail Reed.

She's from a small suburb inL.A. County called Dyer's Bay,

and she even spent time
in an orphanage there.

But?

But she's been dead
for almost 10 years.

What?

Abigail Reed was an orphanwho was found dead in the shower

when she was 15 years old.

How is that possible?

Well, there may
be something here.

The orphanage said thatAbigail's best friend there

disappeared shortly
after her death.

They assumed she freaked
out and ran away.

Her name was Linda Reynolds, andshe was also from Dyer's Bay.

Why does any of this matter?

Because, according to this,Linda wasn't really an orphan.

She was a ward of the state.

Her mother went nuts
when she was like seven

and they locked her up.

What about the father?

Disappeared, never seen again.

They found little Lindalocked up in her bedroom.

She's been there a while, too.

Pretty creepy, huh?

And let me guess, you foundno trace of Linda Reynolds

after the death of
Abby Reed, right?

Yeah.

Is Linda Reynolds'
mother still alive?

Yeah.

She lives in a state
mental hospital

up north a little ways.

Been there almost 20 years.

You're not thinking aboutgoing up there, are you?

Just give me the address.

Abby?

Abby, can you get
my prescription?

Abby?

Abby?

[ominous music]

Time for your medicine.

[muffled scream]

KIDS [ON MACHINE]: You'vereached the Eastman residence.

Please leave us a message.

Hi guys, it's me.

It's kind of slow at
the office today, so I'm

going to come home early.

Abby, if you get this, wouldyou pick up Max and Casey?

OK, see you soon.

Bye.


Mrs. Reynolds?

Mrs. Reynolds.

You have a visitor.

Would you mind giving
me a minute, please?

Do you remember your daughterLinda, Mrs. Reynolds?


Why are you doing this?

Love makes you dostrange things sometimes.

What?

Why don't we just wait
for Carter to get home.

I don't want to have
to repeat myself.

Carter won't be
home for hours.

He called while
you were napping.

He'll be home any minute.

I can't wait.

Meghan, where are you going?

Now what are you gonna do?

Oh, come on.

This is embarrassing.

You want to go down?

Then go.


Is that better?

Daddy's home.

Come on Carter, pick up.

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Anybody home?

Hey, did you guys
get my message?

Meghan.

Abby?

Meghan.

Abby!

Abby!

I'm sorry for this.

Meghan!

Meghan!

CHILD'S VOICE: Mommy.

Oh my god.

Sweetie, I'm gonna
be right back.

[ominous music]

Casey?

Max?

Casey?

Max?

Casey?

CHILD'S VOICE: Mommy?

Mommy?

Mommy?



Oh, I gotta go.

School's out soon.

Don't go anywhere, OK?

Hey, you guys want to playa game when we get home?

BOTH: Yeah.

Great, let's go.

Carter, you're awake.

Good.

Did you have a nice nap?

Ugh.

Abby, what's going on?

Where's Meghan?

Don't worry, she's fine.

Well, sort of.

Why are you doing this?

Can you honestly say youdon't remember me at all?

No.

Don't hurt the kids.

I wouldn't do that, Carter.

I never even wanted to hurt you.

Oh, you were so handsome.

I mean, you're handsome now, butwhen we first met, I felt it.

And I know you felt it, too.

Abby, I have no ideawhat you're talking about.

Please, I don't know whatyou're thinking, but please.

You're hurting my
feelings, Carter.

I would have thought by
now you'd remember me

and the time we spent
together in Dyer's Bay.

Dyer's Bay?

My mother was a psycho.

My father and I tried toleave, but she wouldn't let us.

You know what it's like to betied up and left in a bedroom,

like an animal.

My father left us, at least,that's what she told me.

Maybe I was just an impressionof a little seven-year-old.

Maybe I needed a fatherfigure, but watching you then,

you were so convincing.

I think I fell in love
with you that very day.

You're Elizabeth
Reynolds' daughter.

Ding, ding!

We have a winner!

What do you want from me?

What do I want?

I want you.

I want what's mine, and
I'm going to have it.

You're crazy.

But I love you.

I've always loved you.

Abby, what have
you done with Meghan?

Oh.

Let me get her for you.

[music playing]

You know, Meghan,
none of this would've

been necessary if you'dhave been a better mother.

Leaving little Max and Casey allalone with a complete stranger?

You should be
ashamed of yourself.


Think that's clever, bitch?


You all right?

I'm all right.

Watch out, watch out!

It's my family.

It's mine.

Honey, you all right?

I'm all right, but
I fired the sitter.
