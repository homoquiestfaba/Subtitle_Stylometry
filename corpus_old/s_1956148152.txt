That's the sentiment

me to stay clear of this.

Ricky's a leper.

Look, Bill, it's not like
he killed anyone.

650 grams, Rick.
That's the law.

You know how much was

That's 8,000 grams.
It would be better for Ricky

We just can't say
anything publicly.

Yeah, but I can.
I go to the press, tell them

the Feds turned my son

That's not a smart move.

Ricky's in a tough spot.
I appreciate that.

But we're not here
to negotiate.

We don't have
a lot of power here.

This is not a federal case.

And the Bureau rejects
any narrative that suggests

we encouraged Ricky
to sell drugs.

He did that on his own,
and he got caught.

And now he's facing
a life sentence.

We want to offer Ricky
an opportunity,

maybe a way out.

<font color="#FF4500">RICHARD:</font> What's he got to do?

We'd like to get an agent
on the inside.

we can get some convictions...

Let her know that your Miami

needs protection
for a large shipment.

You get her to meet him,

get the introduction
to the father,

and we'll take it from there.

You guys are going after

You're going after the mayor.

We have no intention

Okay.

Some kind of contract.

I'm sorry,
