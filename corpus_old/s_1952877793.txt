Folks said that he was a rounder,
a drunkard, a troubadour.

Some went so far as to claim
he was a murderer.

To the boy,
he was nothing more than a ghost.

Some unseen spectre
whose only proof of existence

was the damage he left in his wake.

But the boy would not be able to deny
the phantom's existence

when it showed up in the flesh.

After 40 years,
the old man was coming home.

BLOODWORTH

Wait's over, boy.

In order to... Manuscripts,
all submissions must be typed.

Brownie!

You better do something
about these dogs or I'm gonna...

Fleming!

Fleming Bloodworth.

You sure have grown
since I saw you last.

I was hoping
you'd come back to school this year.

Yeah, I was planning
on finishing up. I just got--

tied up in other things, you know?

Two months shy of graduation.

It's always a shame
when a young person quits.

So, what did you think
of that book I gave you?

It's a good one, I reckon.

I'll make sure to return it to you
if that's what worries you.

No, no, it was a gift.
There's some others you should read.

I think you'd enjoy.

Fleming, I'd like to help you.

I know something
about the situation you're in.

The what?

Your home life.

There ain't any goddamn thing wrong
with my home life.

When you get done
pushing around with that girl's toy,

put that on that engine.

I've done took the tools back.

You know how he gets.

I don't give a shit how he gets.
You tell him we need 'em.

And he knows how I get.

I don't guess you've seen any
of your mama?

Nope.

-You got any clean shirts?
-There's that box under your bed.

We got any coffee?

Fleming?

Oh, Goddamnit!

Still batching, I see.

I wasn't expecting no company.

Come to see Boyd.

I had a sense you was around.

I've come about Pa.

-He's coming back here.
-What?

He's had a stroke of paralysis.
He ain't got nowhere else to go.

That must be a hell of a stroke
for him to come back here.

I was glad I read that letter
while Ma was asleep.

Brady, don't you think

that after 40 years
she might have noticed he's gone?

Says he's got to walk with a stick.

He thinks he's going to die
but he's not.

I read it out in the cards.

Jesus Christ!

The old man may die at some point,
but he ain't gonna die from the stroke.

You seem to like
the idea of him suffering, Brady.

You seem to be suffering
just a little bit yourself.

Bible says you reap what you sow.

The Bible also says

that fortune tellers and soothsayers
are an abomination before God.

But you probably just forgot that verse,
didn't you, Brady?

He sent me money to buy him a trailer.

Probably expected an open invitation

just to move right back in the house
with me and Mama.

If I remember right, Brady,

his name is still on the goddamn deed,
ain't it?

There's one more thing.

Warren called

about that boy's mama.

He called you?

You ain't got no phone.

-Said he seen her in Nashville.
-Bullshit!

She's never been to Nashville.

She wouldn't even know
how to find Warren's fucking place.

She didn't go to Warren's place.
He just spied her out on the sidewalk.

Just walking.

Oh, it was her all right.

Her and her new fella.

Could you get me another shot?

Hi.

-Are you Warren?
-Yes, I am.

Warren Bloodworth?

Have a seat.

Yes, sir.

-Would you like a drink?
-I think I will.

Warren, I'm Hazel and I'm a singer.

I wanna be a singer.

I am going to be a singer.
But I need a job

and I hear you could give me a job.

-I can give you a job.
-Oh, yeah? Let me see.

I'll take it.

-You're bad. Beg...
-Come on, just like that.

-Give me some of it. Oh, that's good.
-Do you like that? Do you like that?

Do you want more? Do you want...

Well, that is perfect.

-That pizza is so good.
-Yeah...

-Hey, Warren. It's Colt.
-Hey, hey.

Get your butt on down here.
This fella won't leave.

-What?
-Says he's your brother.

I'll just be a minute...

-You better get down here.
-Shit.

Hey?

Get out of here.

I have perfectly...

Hey! No, no, no.

I told him not to bother you,

but he's an asshole, so he bothered you.

Daddy's coming home.

I heard that.
I heard some other shit, too.

She ain't here.

You're saying my wife's not here?

I saw her walking.

She with a guy?

You know what it is? Twin, .50 calibre.

Right there, twin .50s.

My fort.

To defend myself
from your asshole bartender,

principally, that's why.

You got any place to stay?

Told asshole I'll just lay on over there
on that bandstand

and not to bother you.

Well, come on.

Hey.

-Come on.
-Fort.

Come on! Fort.

Sorry to hear about your dog.
I know how much you thought of Brownie.

I doubt that. They're just dogs to you.

When I seen
Brownie's guts twisted like that,

I felt something twist inside me.

Where's Boyd?

Figure him to be hungry, too,
what with all that rambling.

Brady told he was back.

-He's gone.
-What?

Again?

-Whereabouts this time?
-Nashville, I reckon.

Brady told about Warren calling.

Warren called? News to me.

You hear that? News to me.

I swear. The men in this family...

Harwood did it.

Reckon he thought
he's gonna teach me a lesson.

Well, we'll see about that.

Did you see him do it?

Don't need to see everything
to know it to be true.

You know what this is?

-A pill bottle?
-No, look closer.

Cigarette butt?

It's Harwood's cigarette butt.
It's got his essence on it.

And I am using this essence
to put a mighty hurt on Old Harwood.

His insides will petrify
and his stool will turn to concrete.

You watch.

Remind me never to leave anything
of mine lying around for you to find.

Look, I didn't come here
for no witchcraft lesson. I just...

I wanna know
if I could borrow them tools again.

I have told you,
if you don't get a new carburettor,

the motor won't even fire.

I got one. Daddy brought it in.

Bring them wrenches back
where you got them.

And don't get them rusted.

Hey. Hey, hey, Harwood! Harwood!
I need a stamp. Oversized.

In the glove box.

There must be something going around.

Yeah.

-Hey, that son of a bitch here?
-Dad ain't here.

Not your son of a bitch dad. My dad!

No.

Son of a bitch!
Drove all this way. Hazel!

Your daddy here? Boyd? Boyd here?

No. He's gone up to Nashville, I reckon.
Brady told about you calling about Mama.

You seen him?

No, I ain't.
Hey! You wanna go for a ride?

Come on. I got enough beer.

Who's that?

She's my accountant.

Your accountant?

Yeah, on the account that
she can suck a...through a...

She knocked out or passed out?

A little of both.

No, I don't got a driver's licence.

That's all right. I'll pay
for your fine, if you get caught.

You're not drunk, are you?

-No.
-All right. Good.

You provide the sobriety
and I'll provide the cash and the car.

Hold on to that. Put it in your pocket.

The last four days,
I've bought and paid for enough friends

to hold a Baptist foot washing.

Who the fuck are you?

-Thief! Get out!
-Hey!

-Whoa! Whoa...
-Get out...

-Hazel!
-But he's trying to steal your car.

No. No. Hazel.

That's my young nephew, Fleming.

Hazel, Fleming. Fleming, Hazel.

There you go. Here, have one of those.

I don't have anything
to wash it down with.

There you go.

Good.

She always like that?

No, just when she's awake.

Don't worry about Boyd.
He'll turn up one day,

when he's old, and broke
and ready to die. I'd piss on him.

Take my advice. Move on, like I did.

Where we at?

Piece of heaven, son.
Little piece of heaven.

-What about her?
-She'll be fine.

Hey!

Warren Bloodworth!

Oh, my God! This night's
just gotten a whole lot better.

Wow! You could have called.
Who's this fine looking young thing?

This here is my nephew Fleming.

Hi.

Hey, is your daughter around?

Yeah. She's floating
around here somewhere.

I'm gonna get you some wine.

Glasses are over here.

Let's see a hundred.

A hundred. Give me a hundred.

This is good wine.

I just love a man
who knows what he wants.

Lord, have mercy on our souls!

You sort of favour Warren.

Are you all kin?

He's my daddy's brother.

Why aren't you drunk?

I can't imagine Warren Bloodworth
with a sober relative.

I don't really drink that much.
I don't care for that feeling, you know.

It makes you

miss things.

You mean it dulls your senses?

Yeah. It dulls your senses.
Drinking does.

Why didn't you just say that then?

I don't know.

I think you've addled me, sort of.

You mean I've vamped you.

Like one of them old silent movie stars
with those long black eyelashes?

What do you think I am?
One of them high priced call girls?

No! Lord, no.

You think I'm a cheap call girl?

No, I don't think anything at all.
I was just... I was...

Warren! Warren! Warren!

Let's go for a walk. Come on.

-What's your name?
-Fleming Bloodworth.

-Yours?
-Raven.

Raven Lee Halfacre.

You know,

I said that you favoured Warren,
but now I ain't so sure.

You know how he's got
that smart ass look about him.

Yes, I do.

You don't really have that.

You look nice. Sweet.

You ain't the talker he is either.

He'd have a girl's blouse
talked off by now.

Thanks.

I don't mind buying it for you,
but why do you read stuff like that?

-You don't like to read?
-No, I read, just not stuff like that.

You don't like pretty girls
wearing pretty things?

I like pretty girls.

I just don't wanna waste
my reading time on them.

Not that I'm wasting my time with you.

-I mean...
-I think I know what you mean.

What's this magazine going to cost me?

Boys are always
expecting something in return.

What do you expect?

Nothing.
I don't expect nothing from you.

Just as long as you understand

that I ain't some watered down version
of my mama.

I ain't nothing like her.

I had to change my name from Evelyn.

I suspect before long
I'll be changing Halfacre, too.

Shit, you're planning
on getting married?

You don't have to get married
to change your name.

Anybody can.

Mama thinks that I'm pretty enough
to get into some kind of show business.

I think she sees me
as her best shot out of Tennessee.

She hates Tennessee.
Says it's full of hillbillies.

-Where's she from?
-Tennessee.

-Where are you from?
-Tennessee.

You don't really sound like it.

Really?

You don't either, much.

Well, I watch the television
and I practise.

Hollywood don't want no hillbillies.

So you can't sound like that.

How about you?

You practise on TV?

No. I don't really watch TV, much.

I just read.

But how in the world is reading
gonna make you sound smart?

I don't know.

Hey.

-Oh, no.
-What?

Move the fuck out of my house
when I tell you

to get the fuck out of my house!

You do not tell me what to do,
you goddamn whore!

-And you cheating bastard!
-Hey! Hey, hey!

What are you... Don't touch me!

-You bitch...
-Mama!

-Okay. You want...
-Fine.

You fucking bitch,
you fucking deserve that.

Where have you been?

-We just walked to town.
-What's on your face? Did he hit you?

-No.
-No! No!

-Mrs. Halfacre.
-No, Mama. You're seeing things.

Don't you talk to me, you little shit,
you little Bloodworth bastard!

I'm gonna walk out
of this room right now.

When I get back here,

I want that two-timing
motherfucker bastard

and his fucking girlfriend, cunt,
bitch out of my house

and I mean it!

I mean it.

Get him up. Hey.

Come on, we gotta go.

-Hey.
-Come on, Warren. Let's go, let's go.

I'm sorry you had to see that.

I can't imagine
what you think about me right now.

Well, why is that?
It's not you, it's her.

So you just don't need
to be apologising.

Thanks for the magazine.
You ever gonna make this way again?

I actually,
I don't really know where we are.

You're in Fulton. It's far away I guess.

Hey!

Well, do you want to
go out with me next weekend?

I'd love to. Yeah.

I'd like that.

-Well, what is there to do around here?
-We'll find something to do.

Hey, Warren! What? Give me those keys!

Mighty early for a young fella
like yourself to be drinking.

This hour is reserved for professionals.

You know anyone looking to hire?

Not rightly, but you might look on the
board over there, might be something.

Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

I'd expect old Trigger Lipscomb
to walk in here

rather than you darkening my door.

Itchy, can you give me a ride up
to home?

I'll pay ya.

Fleming might be able to.
He's looking for work.

Boy, are you looking
to make some money?

Yes, sir. That I am.

Can you give me a ride?
I'll pay you 20 bucks.

Where to?

Grinders Creek.

Grinders Creek, for 20 bucks? Sure.

Just pull it around the back,
pick me up. Be quiet about it.

For 20 bucks, I can be real quiet.

I thought you were dead when they
delivered that old Gibson here.

I was dreading
putting on a suit for your funeral.

Itchy, I ain't got time
to explain everything now.

I gotcha. Your guitar's in the back.
Let's go get it.

Where's your toilets?

Hey, in there!

I say, hey in there.

Say, good buddy,
where's that old man at?

Ain't nobody in here but me.

That's, except you.
What old man are you talking about?

-Rutgers.
-I don't know nobody by that name.

He was wearing a grey fedora. He had
a walking stick carved like a snake.

He's an old man. He just...

He just walked through that door
a few minutes ago.

I never seen him.

He's got a son that's a retard.
Got kicked in the head by a mule?

Preaches to chickens.

Can't be too many people
that meets that description.

I don't know nobody like that.

Now, look, me and that old man, we...

We done some business
on the way down here.

I'm gonna buy
a herd of Black Angus from him.

I don't know what you're talking about.

I just watched him walk
through that door right there.

You were sitting in here
on this side of that door.

And now you're telling me
you never saw him.

Mister, I ain't got time to argue
with you. I got a business to run.

Yeah, well, how about I haul your ass
over that counter

and I just mop up the floor with it?

I'll give you two reasons why not.
One, two.

Now then,

you're in my place of business

and the law's gonna believe
that you came in here to rob me

and I didn't care to be robbed!

You people done fucked
with the wrong man.

I did not drive 400 miles out of my way

to deliver some old cripple
to some beer joint.

That son of a bitch owes me some cattle!

That might be true,
but I'm sick of listening to it.

You tell Rutgers

he's gonna regret this
for the rest of his days.

I will if I ever meet the man.
Now, you get the hell out of here.

Whereabouts?

Hell, anywhere along here will do.

Where are you headed?

My uncle's place.
I just got to drop off some wrenches.

Fleming, honey,
you want me to fix you some food?

No, thanks, I'm fine.

-Who you got in the car with you?
-Some old fellow needed a ride.

He's paying me,
though, so I better get on.

I was told Boyd had him a son.

You'd be him.

How'd you know that?

The name's Bloodworth.

E. F. Bloodworth.

You favour me somewhat,

at least back when I was a young man.

Well, hell, I know where you're going.

This water ain't fit for drinking.

She runs deep, but it ain't spring fed
or nothing like that.

Thought about digging you a well,

but that's a lot of digging to do
by yourself.

I ain't put off by hardship.
Live in a brush arbor if I have to.

Four thousand
sure don't buy what it used to.

Yeah, that's Brady's doing.

I told him it was crooked.

I put this up for shade though, and I
put you some privacy for your privy.

Brady just left a hole.

I didn't know how to level out your
house, though, especially with no help.

It's sturdy with this though.

I'm obliged.

I would have brought you some food
if I'd known you were coming.

If you get too hungry, just do like
I do and go back up and see Granny.

She'll fix you something.
She likes to feed people, so...

I expect I'd better be settled in here
before I go see your granny.

Warren and Boyd, they about?

No. Daddy's up at Nashville
looking for my mama.

Looking for your mama?
What, did he lose her?

Yeah, sort of.

Oh, no. No, no, no.
No, I don't need a hog. I need money.

Look, your ad didn't say anything
about any hog.

But I ain't got no money.

Hog, come on. Let's go. Come on.

Come on. Come on.

We're gonna make it. Just go on in.

You comfortable back there?

What the... Fuck me!

Anybody wanna buy a hog?

I almost gave up on you.

I was working. Making a living.

I brought these.

They're all on that reading list.

Did you get a chance to look over that
literature concerning the GED?

Some.

Well, they're going to be giving
that test at MTSU

coming up at the end of the semester.

That study guide is very helpful.

All right.

You can just leave them books
on the steps there.

Okay.

Much obliged.

-Where are you going, son?
-There's a coyote, Mama.

I just need to run it off
before it hurts something.

Are you crazy?
Don't you know enough to stay put?

I'm accustomed to putting myself
wherever I want to be.

I don't want you around Ma.

So you just head right back through
the woods, where you came from.

I ain't hurting nobody.

You think I aim to hurt her?

You did that a long time ago and
I ain't about to let you do it again.

She's old. Mind's getting feeble.

As far as I know, you've been forgot
and I aim to see that it stays that way.

Boy, you got me all wrong.
I don't wanna hurt nobody any more.

You get your sorry ass
back to that swamp where you belong.

I think you like the idea of me
cramped in that piece of tin.

Piece of tin I paid you $4,000 for,
mind you.

No lights, no water.

You wanted to make it hard on me.
Well, I got news for you.

Hard is what I'm used to.

When you let out of here 40 years ago,
you never looked back

because you didn't care.

You left us standing right there
on that porch

and you took your guitar with you.

Your new fancy guitar
that you had your name painted on.

Well, I had your name first!

I didn't take off.

I didn't pull a Boyd or a Warren.
I stayed where I belonged.

And I have had to sit here
and watch her wither away

all these years out of sorrow.

But you didn't see it.

No, you was off in Arkansas
or someplace plucking on your guitar.

I never felt I had to explain my actions
to any man.

But I'll tell you this,
you don't know the whole story,

not even half of it.

You stay away from here.

Because if you don't,
I will make it hard on you, old man.

Who's there?

Whisky wasn't my undoing.

It was music.

My bane and my salvation.

That's what Brady says. Warren, too.

Maybe them boys know me better
than I thought.

I used to be pretty good at this.

If I had a player,
I could show you how good I was.

Did you get a good piece off
of that hog?

Pretty good.

What put you in the working mood
all of a sudden?

I don't know, just trying
to pay my way is all, I guess.

I bet she's a pretty thing, ain't she?

I could tell you'd been love struck

the minute I laid eyes on you.

Yeah, well, I don't know
how love struck she still is.

I was supposed to take her out
last weekend and I didn't show up.

Had to finish painting
that goddamn house.

I'm taking her out this weekend.
Dinner, movie, whatever she wants.

And I don't care
what her mama has to say about me.

I felt that way about your granny, too.

Her daddy thought low of me.

Said I was a drunkard, a layabout,
patron of whores.

Of course, I was all those things,
but I didn't like him saying it.

Yeah.

Granny doesn't really talk
about you too much,

at least not to me.

I can't say I blame her.

Her daddy swore I was bad for her
and I did my best to prove he was wrong.

But I wasn't too successful at it.

Well, actually I do remember her saying
one thing about you which is,

you used to make your own whisky.

That's what they sent me to the pen for.

Well, she left that part out.

I only served a year or so.

Long enough for them to keep
a close eye on me after I got out.

Made it a little harder
for me to re-fire my still.

But you started up again
after you got out of the pen?

I always started up again.
I got shot at more than I was hit.

I guess that made me think
I was ahead of the game.

I could never quit while I was ahead.

What's her name?

Raven.

That's a good name.

I got a gal
Sweet as she can be

I got a gal
Sweet as she can be

Raven is her name

And she thinks the world of me

Sweet as she can be

I got a gal
Sweet as she can be

Raven is her name

And she thinks the world of me

You gotta start singing that song.

So, is it true you played
at the Grand Ole Opry?

Well, I played the Ryman once
back when the Opry was still there.

Just one show, opening for some boys
that had a song on the radio.

-Hell, you made records.
-One. I cut one.

They didn't play it much.

So I run up against this radio feller
once at one of my shows.

I found him insulting
and pulled a knife on him.

That kind of put the kibosh
on my radio play.

You going to a wedding or a funeral?

You cash a cheque?

Well, I think I can handle that.

-There you go.
-No, I don't take no handouts.

I don't recall ever paying you
for that taxi ride I bought from you.

You treat that little girl right.

Lord God.

Are you talking about me or the car?

If you're talking about the car,
don't worry about it.

I thought you forgot all about me.

-I can't go anywhere. Mama...
-Who's out there?

It's a salesman!

I didn't come all this way
just to get stood up.

Get your ass in here right now!

Go wait down the road a piece. Okay?

Mama!

Nice car.

What about your mama?

She got her prescription
filled this morning. 

She's out. Will be for a long time.

You smell nice.

Good enough to eat.

Hey!

What's gotten into you?

We're sitting right here
in the middle of the road.

What's gotten into you?
You're the one who started it all.

You're right. I'm sorry.

Sorry.

So, this is, a date sort of?

What do we do now?

-Have you done this before?
-No.

Here you go, Evelyn.

You know what they say
about a man with big feet?

What?

It's just a joke.

You know, I think I may have to
rethink my whole philosophy on life

after going out with you.

How do you mean?

Well, for one thing
you do what you say you're gonna do.

You said you was going to take me out
and you did.

I just about decided that men were
the worst kind of trash on the planet.

They use you and drop you
and slap you around.

Take your Uncle Warren.

You can take that type if you want.
That ain't my style.

If a guy like Warren were
to take me out,

which he wouldn't, he wouldn't
take a girl anywhere except to bed.

But if he drove a car
that smelled like yours

or run like that, which he wouldn't,

because a guy like that always has
to drive something new and fancy.

It wouldn't have bothered him
one bit, though.

A guy like that would be
just like "Tough shit".

Now I could tell that it bothered you.

I noticed.
You were embarrassed about it.

You're thoughtful.

Come on.

I ain't putting that back on.

It's my phone number in lipstick.

Hey. You want one of Mama's oxys?

If we just take half, it'll kind
of knock the edge off, you know?

No, thanks.
I'm pretty addled around you as it is.

Earlier tonight you said that

you weren't like the rest
of your family.

They can't be much worse than my mama.

In different ways they can.

What's your father like?

Damned if I know.
I don't think Mama did either.

Probably why she run off.

She must have been like my mama.

No, no, no, she wasn't like that at all.
She was, she was real quiet.

She always seemed kind of sad
like she wanted Daddy

or somebody to pull her out of it.

When I was a little girl,

I used to ask men around town
if they knew my daddy.

Most of what I heard wasn't good.

I guess he took a bunch of folks
for their money.

And he was just gone.

I wish I'd kept my mouth shut
and not asked.

I probably shouldn't even be
telling you this.

I should've just told you
he was a Baptist preacher

who got killed
on a mission or something.

I'm never much on preachers anyhow.

You've never done this before, have you?

No. No, I haven't.

It's okay. I'll show you.

Get the fuck out of my house!

-Mama!
-Hey! You sit your ass right back down!

-Don't! Mama!
-Sit down.

-Mrs. Halfacre, I'm sorry.
-Don't you "Mrs" me.

-Mama, stop it!
-You shut up!

You fucker,
you stay the fuck out of my house!

What is wrong with you?

I can't trust you.

Mama, he's not like all the other men.

What, like most men?
He's not like most men?

You don't even know him!

There ain't but one thing
that any of them wants

and once they get it,
they got no use for you, baby.

No, no, no.

-You know the rules.
-Those are your rules.

They're our rules.

You wear a condom,

you don't give any heart,

and no sleepovers.

-You don't even know him.
-Oh, baby.

-You a Bloodworth?
-Who's asking?

The name's Coble.
I'm looking for an E. F. Bloodworth.

Evening, Mr. Rutgers.

I take it you've been talking
to the big cattle man.

Mr. Coble was in my office ranting

and raving about you
owing him a herd of cattle.

I just wrote him off as a near lunatic.

The next thing I know

the county attorney
started asking questions about you.

Figured it was Coble who
got him stirred up.

I'm much obliged to you for telling me.

I don't suppose you
have any recollection

about Harold Lipscomb, do you?

Trigger Lipscomb?

Of course I remember him.
He put me in the pen.

You never saw him again
when you got out?

Not that I recall. Why?

Just wondering. County attorney.

It seemed Lipscomb just up
and disappeared all those years ago,

about the same time you did.

The report says that...

Well, you hear all kind
of rumours and stuff.

If you're gonna be chasing down everyone
who ever wanted Trigger Lipscomb dead,

you got a long road ahead of you.

Have a good day, Mr. Rutgers.

Brady thinks I'm crazy.

-Do you?
-No.

I'm hearing music, guitar.

Brady says it's all in my head.
What do you think?

I think if you
thought you heard guitar music,

then you heard guitar music.

It's E.F. I'm hearing.

I know those songs.
Ain't no mistaking it.

Do you know how it is I'm hearing E.F.?

Granddaddy bought a trailer

or at least he sent money
so that Brady could buy him one.

He had a stroke over in Carolina,
but he's okay now.

Where is his trailer?

Across that field over yonder?

That's where the music's coming from.

It's by that old pond.

At the dump?

That's the craziest thing I ever heard.

If he had a trailer, why wasn't it set
up here where there's power and water?

Brady.

If sense was gunpowder,
every one of you men together

wouldn't have enough to load
a round of birdshot.

Folks say I'm losing my mind.

Hey... Don't tell Brady that I told.

He'll try and put some sort
of curse on me.

You know about Harwood?

Harwood had stomach cancer.

Had it a year or so and never knew it.

Yeah, well, Brady put a curse on him.

Brady and his curses. I'll put a curse
on him if he ain't careful.

What's E.F. like these days?

He's pretty easy going.

Age must have slowed him down.

Easy going ain't how people seen him
when I known him.

You're here for the GED?

The name's Elbert Fleming Bloodworth II.

Can I help you?

I'm Warren.

Your son.

When I was a boy,
you said you'd take me fishing.

You never did.

Come on.

How you making it, Pa?

I'm making it, I reckon.

I better pass.

Been feeling kind of poorly
the last couple of days.

Well, I hope you don't mind
if I have a snort.

You're past the age
where what I think matters.

Itchy says

Boyd's boy Fleming
comes by and you visit with him.

Fleming's a good boy.

You got that right.

Yeah, most boys his age would be
out drinking beer and chasing tail.

Not him, though.

I doubt that boy could touch a titty
without falling in love.

He's got a good heart.

Yeah, odd though, isn't it?

It just don't fit in our fam-damn-ily.

Black sheep.

You ever see Brady?

No.

Look, he's just getting weirder.

He was odd turned
by the time he was a baby.

If you wanted to see him odd turned,

you should have stuck around
and seen him in high school.

Warren! This is not Miami!

Well, I guess I'm gonna go
where the palm trees grow.

We'll catch a fish when I get back.

-I don't want your money.
-I don't want it either.

-You be careful.
-Too late for that.

You and Warren
enjoy your little fishing excursion?

-How'd you know we were fishing?
-I know lots of things.

What I wanna know is why
you told all them lies on me.

I don't remember saying anything
about you, truth or lies.

That cattleman Coble,
he seems to remember word for word

about how crazy I am, retarded.

How I go about preaching to stumps,

baptising chickens, marrying cows.

-That.
-Yeah, that.

I always knew that
you was evil and worthless.

I should have counted on being betrayed.

It had nothing to do with you.

Needed a ride to Tennessee.

Coble don't find the humour in it.
Says you made him look like a fool.

Hell, I'll just pay his ride bill
and be done with it.

He's hired a lawyer,
gonna have you declared incompetent.

The court's gonna appoint somebody
to look after your business.

Well, you'd be a fine candidate
for that.

You couldn't look after the business
a sitting hen could accumulate.

Well, it don't matter.

It don't matter
because you are fixing to die.

And worse yet,
you are going straight to hell.

I guess God told you that, didn't he?

Yes, he did.

-You talk to God a lot?
-Yes, I do.

Well, then I guess he told you

if you don't get your ass
on down the road,

I'm gonna beat
the hell out of both of you.

Well, I don't care if she is at home.
I can't wait any longer.

I just... I can't see you right now.

You've made every excuse
for the past two months.

Raven...

I thought... I thought you cared for me.

I do, Fleming.

I just need time to think, okay?

Well, you better get your thinking done
with because I'm coming over.

Mama or no Mama.

Look, Mrs. Halfacre, I know you don't
care much about my family

and I understand that.

I understand that. I do but...

She ain't here.

Could you...

Could you go find her
and bring her home, please?

Storm's coming in.

-Bad one.
-Yeah?

You drive all this way
to give me a weather report?

Your mama told me to come get you.

What's the matter with her?
She's treating me like I'm human.

Desperately searching for a bridegroom.

What is she looking at?

She's just wondering.

Wondering what?

If you're the father.

So, what are you gonna do?

Mama had me when she was 17.
She made it. I will, too.

Whose is it?

It's not yours,
if that's what's bothering you.

It is a Bloodworth, though.

Warren.

Warren, you sick son of a bitch.

I'm gonna kill him.

He didn't force me...

I'm gonna... I'll fucking kill him.

I was willing.

It happened before I met you.

I was pregnant. I just didn't know it.

I gotta go.

It's about to be awful outside.

I bet Mama would let you stay
on the couch this time.

I can't.

I gotta get back.

The old man's
been feeling badly of late.

Will you call me when you get home?

Why?

Because I'm afraid
I may never see you again.

I don't... I don't have a phone.

You should get inside.

I don't suppose you
have any recollection

about Harold Lipscomb, do you?

It seemed Lipscomb just up and
disappeared about the same time you did.

You left us standing right there
on that porch.

You are going straight to hell.

I guess God told you that, didn't he?

Are you crazy?
Don't you know enough to stay put?

You get your sorry ass
back to that swamp where you belong.

Hey. Hey, come on.

Hey. You should come inside.

She's dead.

The accountant's fucking dead.

Oh, Lord.

It's an accident. It's an accident...

We got a problem.
Come on, we gotta get her out of here.

-There is no "We".
-We gotta get her out of here.

-There is no "We". There's only you.
-We gotta get her...

No, no, no. Keep your hands off me.
Get off me, you!

Get up!

Get the fuck out of my fucking life!

Get in that fucking car!
Get up! Get the fuck out of here!

And you stay away from Raven!

Sorry son of a bitch!
Get the fuck up! Go!

Go! Go!

Get the fuck out of here!

Hey, man.

Baby?

Did you forget your keys again
or did you just miss me?

Boyd.

Hey, Patricia.

Boyd, what have you done?

Oh, my God.

What have you done?
What have you done? What have you done?

Sorry, I'm bothering you.

I'm supposed to tell you that
your daddy... Your daddy's got cancer.

Oh, Boyd.

-Come here.
-Boyd.

No. Oh, my God.

No!

Granddaddy?

No, no.

-I'm gonna go get a doctor.
-No.

Help me.

Help me.

Please.

-No.
-Please. For me.

I can't...

Please.

For me.

Hey, buddy. Everything all right?

Oh, my God!

Beware of false prophets which
come to you in sheep's clothing,

but inwardly are ravening wolves.

Ye shall know them by their fruits.

Do men gather grapes of thorns
or figs of thistles?

Even so every good tree
bringeth forth good fruit.

But a corrupt tree bringeth
forth evil fruit.

A good tree cannot bring
forth evil fruit

neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit.

Every tree that bringeth
not forth good fruit

is hewn down and cast into the fire.

Back home.

Finally back home.

Our secrets are buried with us, E.F.

Our secrets are buried with us.

Fleming Bloodworth,
you've disgraced your whole family.

Not showing up
at your own granddaddy's funeral.

What's the matter with you?
You're sick or something?

What is...

This you?

Somebody's certainly
getting above their raising.

How's it feel to be a tool?

Tool to do my bidding.
How does that feel?

What?

There's more holes left
in that old bastard

than one metal pole was capable
of leaving.

I know the truth.

I did it.

And I did it using you as my tool.
You did my bidding.

-You're crazy.
-I divined it!

You can't be crazy and divine something.

I used your assets and I turned it
on you and used you as my tool...

Give me my book back!
Get the hell out of here!

I'm gonna tell you
the same thing that I told Warren.

It's that
I don't ever wanna see you again.

I'm done.

I don't wanna be
a member of this family no longer.

You don't wanna be a part
of this family?

There's something I can do about that.
I can help you.

I'll burn this whole mess down
with you in it.

And then we'll dig another hole
and stick you

in the ground next to that old bastard,

then you won't be a part of this family.

And that is what blood is worth!

You be sure
and have a good night's sleep.

Hey.

E.F.?

E.F., that you?

You're a good-looking man, E.F.

Good looking.

But if you go away again this time,
that's the end of it.

That old music's drove you crazy.

It's hurt me.

Worse yet, it's hurt them children.

Do you think children raise themselves,
do you?

No. No. I know they don't.

Them children need you, E.F.

They need you.

-Hear me?
-Yeah.

I know.

Most thought the old man had returned
to make peace with his family.

The boy knew different.

He knew the old man
had made peace with no one.

After a while it occurred to him

that the old man
was making peace with himself

and that had probably been a good part
of the problem all along.

Thank you, Fleming. Thank you very much.

Have a nice weekend, everybody.
See you on Monday.

E.F., look who it is.

-How's it going?
-Daddy!

Come on!

-Let's go! Let's go.
-Okay.

One, two, three, whoa...
