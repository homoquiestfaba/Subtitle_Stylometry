MICHAEL JACKSON - BLACK OR WHITE

I took my girl on a Saturday bang

Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles

And a miracle happened tonight.

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby

It don't matter if you're black or white


They print my message in the Saturday Sun

I had to tell them I ain't second to none


And I told about equality and it's true


Either you're wrong or you're right


But, if you're thinkin' about my baby

It don't matter if you're black or white




I am tired of this devil

I am tired of this stuff

I'm tired of this business,

Sew when the going gets rough

I ain't scared of your brother

I ain'ts scared of no sheets

I ain't scared of nobody

Girl when the going gets tough

Protection for gangs, clubs and nations

Causing grief in human relations

It's a turf war on a global scale



I'd rather hear both sides of the tale.

See, it's not about races, just places, faces.

Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is .

I've seen the bright get duller

I'm not going to spend my life being a color


Do not tell me you agree with me 

When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye




But, if you're thinkin' about my baby

It don't matter if you're black or white




I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby



It don't matter if you're black or white




I said if

You are thinking of being my brother

It don't matter if you're black or white




It's black, it's white

It's tough for them to get by

It's black, it's white Whoo

It's black, it's white

It's tough for them to get by
