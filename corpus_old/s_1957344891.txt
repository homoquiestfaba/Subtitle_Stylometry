â™ª She lives alone

â™ª with no one who can see
she's unhappy â™ª

â™ª she knows what she lost

â™ª still she is waiting
for more â™ª

â™ª she could be living in hell

â™ª and not know
someone loves her â™ª

â™ª what can she do?

â™ª What is she waiting for?

â™ª The day turns to night

â™ª he just can't find
the right words to tell her â™ª

â™ª twisting and turning

â™ª and looking
for something to say â™ª

â™ª if you would let me
hold you â™ª

â™ª I wouldn't walk away

â™ª that's what he wants

â™ª that's what he wants to say

â™ª he knows when she cries

â™ª and he saw through the lies
that she told him â™ª

â™ª she's dreaming
and planning â™ª

â™ª of how she could
ask him to stay â™ª

â™ª if you would let me
love you â™ª

â™ª I wouldn't be the same

â™ª please could we try

â™ª please could we try again?

â™ª It is safe to sleep alone

â™ª in a place no one knows

â™ª and to seek life under stars

â™ª in a place full of love

â™ª it is best to find and seek

â™ª the missing pieces
that you lost â™ª

â™ª best that you
refuse to weep â™ª

â™ª ash to ash

â™ª dust to dust

woman: Help me.

Help me.

â™ª It is strange
to sleep alone â™ª

â™ª in a place no one knows

â™ª strange to shelter
upon the stars â™ª

[Woman groaning]

â™ª In a place full of love

please help me.

â™ª It is safe to walk with me

please help me.

â™ª We can breathe
the sky and stars â™ª

Man: We need more fear,
more blood.

â™ª Safe to walk
upon the street â™ª

Ahh, ahh.

Man: Would you like
a drink of anything?

Second man: Lights.

I could just murder
a cup of coffee.

We're almost done.

Get val a coffee.

Good evening,

and welcome to crimetime.

During the next 50 minutes,

you will see the meticulous
reenactments of crimes

which occurred in the city
last night.

Maybe you were
in the area of the crime.

Maybe you saw something

and could be the means by which
a criminal is brought to justice.

If you think you can help,

dial the crimetimenumber.

Remember,

keeping the streets safe
depends on all of us,

but especially...

On you.

I said I love you.

Don't you believe me?

Just leave me alone.

Leave me alone.

I can't leave you alone.

You're inside my head,
and it's driving me crazy.

I just can't take any more.

Well, fuck you!

Fuck you, too.

[Fly buzzing]

[Fly buzzing]

Do you think that's funny?

Well...

I said, do you think
that's funny...

Killing a living creature for no
other reason than it's annoying you?

Why, are you serious?

Man: Come on, Bobby,
Tom didn't mean it.

Am I talking to you?

It's only a fly.

That's it!

You and me, outside right now!

Get up!

How does it feel?

What?

How does it feel...

To be totally
involved in the scene,

this little scene here, hmm?

No time to waste
on anything else.

No time to waste on flies.

It's called focus, Tommy.

You might want
to try it sometime.

Well, here endeth the lesson.

[Music begins]

â™ª Just runnin' scared

â™ª each place we go

â™ª so afraid

â™ª that he might show

â™ª yeah, runnin' scared

â™ª what would I do?

â™ª If he came back

â™ª and wanted you

â™ª just runnin' scared...

What's it like?

I'm sorry?

I've been watching them.

Who?

Them.

They've all been watching you,

wanting you to look at them.

Afraid that you will.

Well, you must know that.

You must... Feel it.

So... what's it like?

I think I should go.

I'm sorry.

I just...

I've got to go
myself in a minute.

Have you time for a quick drink?

No, it's all right.

Just... a drink.

Come, you spirits that
tend on mortal thoughts.

Unsex me here

and fill me
from the crown to the toe

top full of direst cruelty.

Make thick my blood,

stop up the access
and passage to remorse

that no compunctious visitings of
nature may shake my full purpose,

nor keep peace
between the effect and it.

Come...

To my woman's breasts
and take my milk for gall,

you murdering ministers!

Wherever in your sightless
substances,

you wait on nature's mischief!

Come... thick night,

and pall thee
in the dunnest smoke of hell,

that my keen knife see not
the wound it makes,

nor heaven peep through
the blanket of the dark to cry.

Hold! Hold!

Oh.

What's the matter?

It's my eye.
Something's in my eye.

Let's go under the
light. I'll have a look.

Oh.

Don't worry. I'll have
it out in a minute.

Don't hurt me.

Don't worry.

I know what I'm doing.



Why?

What?

What?

What?

Why?

I'm sorry.

This won't take long.



Val: So what was all that,
this evening with Tom?

Bobby: He wants to act,
doesn't he?

I should've...

Val: Played Macbeth.
Yes, we all know, Bobby.

â™ª Bobby should've
got the part â™ª

â™ª Bobby should've
got the part â™ª

They work. I don't.
That's wrong.

Look at them! What do they
think they've seen, a light comedy?

Oh, lighten up, Bobby.
I've been murdered all day.

Let me relax, please.

This one's out of a comic book.

Removed one stocking.

Cut out her left eye.
Took it home with him.

That's beautiful.

What'd he do it with?

Something very sharp and thin.

Victim?

Elizabeth Mayfair,

recent divorcee,

office worker...

A typist at the food ministry.

Man: Get off of me!
Get off of me!

You know what to do.

Boyfriend, family...

Work problems.

How's the witness?

Crimetime?

Is Archer there?

Tell him crowley from central
has got something for him.

Yeah, that's right.
Something good.

Tell him...

Tell him I'll be
waiting his call.

One stocking...

And... one... eye...

Removed.

[Door opens]

[Door unlocks]


Woman: Sidney!

Sidney!

Oh, it's nothing but drugs.

What's that?

Drugs, drugs, drugs. That's all
you hear these days. Disgusting!

That's the newspapers
for you, Thelma.

Do you have to work
so late, Sidney?

I missed you.

I'll stay in
tomorrow night. Promise.

We'll watch some television.

Sidney.

Come and keep me warm!

I've just got to do something.

Won't be a minute.

Hi, and how are you today?

Max...

Let's start with the bad news.

Starline's coming out with 2
new crime programs in June.

That makes 5 that we've
got to compete with.

So make sure our people
get the word...

Get to the crime scene first.

Which means keeping our
police contacts sweet.

Right?

So...

What do we have
on the table this week?

Oh, the usual crop, Millie.

Best of the bunch is

black baby stoned to death
in everhappy park,

blind man and his dog incinerated on
their way to pick up some dry cleaning,

and a perv killing...

Perpetrator cut out the victim's
eye and removed one stocking.

Should be something in that lot.

Harry?

Let's go with the dog.

A dog's got character.

Mort?

Oh, I couldn't agree more.

Dogs always go down well.

Ok, ok, I'm getting it.

Old man and dog
walking down the street...

Everybody knows them,
everybody loves them,

especially the dog.

People pat it. Children
walk by its side.

Suddenly 2 thugs appear
with a can of petrol.

Young woman screams,
"no, no!"

I've got the young
woman... Julia Stein.

Perfect.

Old man and dog
get covered with petrol.

Poof. Up they go
like Roman candles.

Young woman turns to camera,

uh, "if you saw this attack
last Thursday",

please contact crimetime,"
so and so...

Would it be possible

to get a dog from the
pound and set it alight?

I think animal welfare would
have a problem with that.

It'll appeal to the kids.

Moving right along now
to the eye remover...

I have a really good
feeling on this one.

Max.

Well, we've got a witness.

A wino saw the woman with a
man minutes before the killing.

We've got a description.

Yeah. "Longish
blond hair and stocky."

Have we got anyone?

Someone we haven't used before.

Well, they're getting a
bit thin on the ground,

but, um...

Yeah, I think
I may have someone.

Bobby, we're ready for you now.

Ok.

One pair of cord
trousers, light brown...

These are a bit
dark, but they'll do.

One black
wind-cheater type coat.

Got that.

And he could have worn a tie,

so the choice is yours.

This is it.

I feel it.
This is it.

Bobby:
Taxi driver...

You see it?

The gun scene?

De niro choosing the gun.

This one looks nasty.

It is.

We try to be accurate
except for some details.

What details?

I can't give too much away.

Copycat killers.

Crazies who phone up
confessing to anything.

Censors.

Come on, guys, give me a detail.

I need a little detail, you know,
make me feel like part of the gang.

Just between us, ok, Bobby?

Absolutely.

The left eye.

What?

He cut it out.

Slid the knife all
around, and out it came.

Like spooning out jelly.

It's appalling. Very
nasty. Defies belief.

Pity we can't show it.

And he did it with the
kind of knife you're holding.

When you're ready, val,
let's rehearse.

He's keen.

Hi, handsome.

It's weird, isn't it?

This is where he was sitting.

He sat down right here,

and then he looked up
and saw you.

Her, Bobby.

Her.

Do you remember me,

your friendly
neighborhood victim?

What do you think, ged?

It's not very
politically correct, is it,

using me as the victim
over and over.

Do you know why they do that?

No.

Because they all
look the same dead.

Besides, who cares about them?

You're the one they care about.

You're the star.

Let's shoot this, then,
shall we, and then move on?

Come on, crank it up.

Always check the tape.

Means it's a prop.

Ok, Bobby...

Let's see what it looks like.

Stick it in her stomach.

Bobby...

Love...

We're waiting.

Val...

Sweetheart...

You're not helping.

All night?

I'm a person, you know?

I'm not a thief.

Ok, I understand
that. I understand.

All we're asking you to
do is pay a little attention.

Ha ha ha...

Look, we're paying
you, aren't we?

Bobby,

you-you're almost there.

I just feel you're
holding something back.

I know. I know.

I...

I just need to feel
what he felt here.

I just need to get
under his fingernails.

Yeah, well, I admire
your commitment, Bobby,

but just slice the bitch up,

and we can all get a
pizza and go home, ok?

Just slice the bitch up,

then we can all get
some pizza and go home.

Why didn't I think of that?

Running very short of time...

So reach deep within, Bobby.

Let's see that lurking devil.

Where's the knife?

Ok, Bobby...

[Fly buzzes]


Now.

You really did the job.

And you know what
I'm hoping for you?

No, I don't.

For your sake,

I hope the cunt does it again.

Anything to keep you off

the unemployment line, Bobby.

I need some air.

Hey, Bobby, seriously...

We did some good work today.

Thanks.

And good night, my
precious little victim.

Mm, you sweet talker, you.

Simon...

What do you think
he's doing right now?

Who?

Him.

The guy that did it...

That killed the girl.

Who cares?

Be good.

You hear that?

I care.

You are mar...

You are marvelous.

Marvelous.

See ya later, Bobby.

Bobby's gonna be a big star.

Bobby deserves a prize.

I'm a real lady-killer.

Aah... ha ha...

TV: Last night a young girl was
horribly mutilated and murdered

here in tadget's alleyway...

Now here's something
that shouldn't be here.

Oh, good heavens.

Poor thing.

I put some poison down.

I suppose it worked.

I think it did.

Must have crawled in
through this hole at the back

looking for a warm place to die.

It short-circuited
this connection, anyway.

Easy fix.

Have it done
in a couple of seconds.

TV: Please ring our
crimetime number immediately.

Can I get you another drink?

I'll have a vodka and orange.

Another whiskey, please,

and a vodka and
orange for the lady.

How's your wife, Sidney?

Have you had a second opinion?

What?

A second opinion.

I swear by them.

I'm sick of this place.

Let's go for a walk.

Oh.

Val:
It's getting colder.

He holds himself
well, doesn't he?

Here, let me keep you warm.

I'm sorry?

Oh, that terrible man.

Appearances can be deceptive.

He's only an actor,
Mrs. Kravatz.

Only an actor?

He seems real enough to me.

Have a biscuit.

Val: Stop.
You're hurting me...

Bobby: What
do you want?

Oh!

Aah!

Were you there?

Did you see anything?

If you did, phone crimetime

on 0-1-7-1.

Sidney...

Is that you?

Of course it's me.

Who else would it be?

Sidney!

I'm sorry.

I've had a hard morning.

Well, don't take it out on me.

Come...

I'll make us a nice
cup of tea, hmm?

Mahon. Bobby mahon.

Thank you.

Yes. Never miss a show.

Bye.

Mahon...

Mahon.

Answering machine:
I'm not in.

You know what to do.



Walter Prescott here.

Sorry, Bobby.

The lyceum decided
on the other guy.

We should get some response
from crimetime, though.

Don't give up.


Hi, Bobby.

Nicki Weyland
from crimetimehere.

Millicent wants to see
you this afternoon at 3:00.

Can you give me a call if
you can't make it? Thanks.


Sidney: Why...
Didn't she cry?


Why... didn't she cry?



Ok?

Ok. Thanks.

I'm Bobby mahon.

I know.

You can go through.


Yes?

Bobby.

Come in.

Bobby, this is Max bentwhistle,

one of crimetime's producers.

Hello.

Congratulations
on last night's show.

Oh, thank you.

Have you told him
about the response?

I wanted you to be here, Max,

when I told Bobby.

Sit down.

Bobby...

Do you know how many phone calls

we usually receive after a show?

I have no idea.

Between 80 and 100.

And do you know
how many phone calls

we received after
last night's show?

Tell him, Max.

450, Bobby.

450.

That's more than
we've ever had before.

That's more than the
knitting needle killings

and the southside
granny strangler combined.

You really made a hit.

Your passion, your violence

really went over well
with our audience.

And...

We appreciate it, Bobby.

Thank you.

Of course, we all hope that this
maniac gets caught, and soon, but...

If he doesn't and kills again,

well...

Don't leave town,

hmm, Bobby?

Do you know the way out?

Yes.

I'm not lying. He
was fucking brilliant.

I mean, he's usually quite tame,

but last night he
was such an animal.

And you were gonna Chuck him.

I didn't say that.

I just said that he was
a little intense, that's all.

Yeah. The one thing I
can't stand is a polite fuck.

Hello.

Hi. See you
later, val.

Oh, Bobby, I missed your show,

but I'll catch the repeat later.

6:00.

Heard you were marvelous.

Heard you were pretty
marvelous last night.

I hope you bought her
some new ones, you animal.

Watch out, val.

You know what they say
about these actors

once they've got their
teeth into your part.

She seems in top form.

Mm. She is.

So what happened today then?

So did you tell the police?

What's the point?

He could be anyone.

It could mean anything.

"Why didn't she cry" isn't
what I would call normal.

Tell the police, Bobby.
You never know.

He's a nut, right?

But it could be interesting.

Besides, I'm not
keeping it to myself.

I'm telling you, aren't I?

Ok.

Should I have cried,
do you think?

Anyway, it's good news
about the meeting.

Yeah, I suppose so.

You suppose so?

Millicent hargreave
congratulates you,

and you suppose it's good?

Crimetimeis a crap show, val.

But in a way...

It's more real than Macbeth.

Did I tell you that Charley
torrance, the photographer...

I mean, this guy, he's real.

He could be anyone.

He could be checking
you out right now.

Thanks. I was feeling
a little neglected.

Look, all I'm saying is,

crimetimeis crap,

but even with crap
you can do something.

If they just let me
really get under his skin,

if I had time...

Come on, Bobby, calm down.

Let's face it... it was
probably a one off.

You'll never get the
chance to do it again.

The cop doesn't think so...

Because of the eye.

The eye?

He cut out the left eye.

They're keeping it quiet.

But they told you.

I wanted to know.

I wanted to know everything.

Next time they're gonna
let me see the body.

Pretty grisly, hmm?

That's marvelous, Bobby.

Ready yet?

Why do you think he did it?

I don't need to know that, do I?

All I need to know
is how to die.

So what do you fancy?

I told you that Charley torrance

wants to do an
exhibition of photos of me

as crimetime's
victims, didn't I?

Shall I come back?

At the whitehall gallery.

Why did he choose her?

What made her so special?

Can we talk about
something lighter?

I'm hungry, Bobby.
Hungry.

Well, I suppose you're right.

It's probably just a one off.

He won't do it again.

Thelma's vision is
continuing to tunnel,

and as I predicted, she's starting
to slip in and out of catatonia.

And how are you
holding up, Sidney?

It's putting terrible
strain on you.

Oh, it's all right.

No. I'm all right.

No, it's just that sometimes...

I've...

[Crimetimebegins on TV]

Oh, ha...
Fan are you?

It's a repeat of this morning.

You'd get on with my wife.

She wouldn't miss it
for the world.

Don't see it myself.

Making celebrities
out of murderers...

TV: And now as usual,

here are the names of
criminals that crimetimerecently...

Was there something
you wanted to talk about?

Oh, no.

No, nothing.

Well, I won't keep you.

Phone if there are any
problems with the medicine.

Good-bye.

[Commercial plays]

And now for tonight's show.

[Theme music plays]

Good evening.

Last night a young woman
was horribly mutilated

and murdered here
in tadget's alleyway.

She died terrified and alone,

alone, that is,

except for her killer.

But first, what kind of people

would set fire
to a blind man's dog?

Sidney: Why...
Didn't she cry?

Why... didn't she cry?

Why... didn't she cry?

Aah!

No! No! No!

Aah!

Oh, no!

No... no...


No! No!

No!

No!

No!

No.

Oh, god. No.

I know they like you
to be in on things,

get a real feel of it...

But do you really
want to see this?

I need to see it.

Contact lens cleanser.

Makes our job a lot easier.

All we need now is a loose
eyeball with a contact lens on it.

Showtime.

There's no doubt
it's the same one.

He could be on a roll.

Good.

You're all heart, Millie.

Bad news is crimelink

arrived just 10 minutes
after our team.

You're kidding.

They're not sticking
to the rules.

We started this run.

This one's ours.

Well, if the
motherfuckers want a fight,

we'll give it to them.

Anyway, I've... Felt for some
time that the show's got too...

Domestic.

It needs... More style.

It needs to be sharper.

You see to it, Max.

keep the audience with us.

He's our killer, not theirs.

That's right, Millie.

He's our killer.

Well?

What do you think?

Mmm. It's nice!

It's very nice.

Are you going somewhere, Sidney?

No.

Not going anywhere.

Think it suits me?

Isn't it very bright?

There's something for you, too.

For me?

Mm-hmm.

I'll fetch it.

There's just something
I have to do first.

Jane: "The victim,
maddie slocombe..."

Bobby, there's a call for you.

For me?

Oh. Thank you.

Yes?

Remember how soft they are.

How do I, uh...

Here. Let me.

Are you all right, Bobby?

What?

Yeah.

It's nothing.

Shall I go on?

What?

Yeah.

"The victim, maddie
slocombe, 27, lived on her own.

"A regular habitueÃ©
of the disco...

"Very few men friends...

Had an abortion
at the age of 16... "

Simon: How's it going?

Makeup woman: Yeah.
We're nearly ready.

How do you want
the hair? The same?

Yeah, that's good.
That's good.

Have to do something
about the clothes, though.

What's wrong with the clothes?
They worked fine last time.

Well, they won't work this time.

It's nothing
desperately different,

just a little something
here and there.

Make him more...
Noticeable.

So, what, change the jacket?

Something a bit more stylish?

What about... This?

It's still a bit drab.
I like the cut, though.

Something lighter?
Something Italian?

Bobby?

Italian?

Don't you think we're
straying into the bizarre?

A problem?

Well, don't you think he
should wear the sort of clothes

he wore when he...
Did the killing?

Ha ha. Isn't that
the whole point?

Well, the...

The point, Bobby, is to get
people to watch the show.

Well... simon...

Don't we want him caught?

Well... nice one, Bobby,

but the bottom line is
you're too anonymous.

Maybe if you put some
thought into it, you'd realize,

perhaps heis anonymous.

I mean, all this jazzing him up

is... is... is just a load of shit!

If you want a puppet
to dress up,

I suggest you go out
and find one!

Or is that what I am?!

Am I a puppet?!

Look, I'm sorry.

Hey, look...

Don't kill the golden
goose, Bobby.

I know you care,
but, um, to the suits...

You're just another name
on a long list of names.

This morning, you're here.

This afternoon...

Capisce?

So be a good boy and put
on the party clothes, ok?

Gwenda: Simon?

Perfect.

Bobby?

Yeah, sure.

Perfect.

You'll get a lot of crank calls.

What did he say again?

"Remember
how soft they are."

It could mean anything.

So it means nothing.

When they mention things
the public can't,

like the eye, for instance,

that's when we get interested.

So don't worry.

Or get an unlisted number.

Right.

Let's get to work.

So... what do you
want to know today?

Tell me about the wounds.

The first one was
in the stomach.

The knife went in...

And immediately
it was forced upwards.

Would that take much force?

With a knife this sharp,
hardly any force at all.

You wouldn't feel anything
until it was well in,

doing the damage.

No bones to deal with,
no, eh... Obstructions.

Before she knew it, her
stomach would be in shreds.

It would take time.

He didn't give her that time.

He pulled the knife out,
and, still holding her up...

Would there have been
a lot of blood?

Not much.

See, the knife is so thin,

all the bleeding
would be internal.

And, as far as we can ascertain,

he stabbed her
in the lower back.

The knife passed
through one kidney,

but couldn't go any further...

'Cause of the backbone.

Then he let her fall.

Ahhh!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

Come on!
Will you just pretend?

Ok. Ok.

Kill me some more.

You think it's funny?

Bobby...

You think she thought
it was funny?

Was she laughing?

I think you're
getting very heavy.

Come on.
Be nice to me.

The blade got caught
between her vertebrae,

and he had to...

Yank it out!

Oh, I felt that.

Would you?

When the knife's so sharp...

And you're so soft?

Sick, Bobby.
Very sick.

Then... this!

Ow!

Caused a deep cut
from the fifth vertebrae

right on up
to the shoulder blade...


Then...

Oh...

He cut the eye out.

I had you going there, didn't I?

Ready, Bobby?

Oh, not now, Charlie, not now.

Sorry.

[Music plays]

Would you like to dance?

Sure, why not?

Would you like to dance?

Would you like to dance?

Would you like to dance?

Val: Sure, why not?

[Music plays]

Sidney: She said
I could rape her

if only I didn't kill her.

Can you believe that?

Bobby?

Crowley: Amazing, eh?

What?

How soon you get used to it.

Seen enough?

She's cold.

As the grave.

Hi.

If ever you need a
TV fixed, let me know.

I'll get you a good deal.

Thank you.

I'll treasure this.

Well, Thelma,

what do you think?

Could I be a TV star?

Hi, and how are you today?

Oh!

Ahh.

Thelma:
Oh, I love you.

Sidney?

Man: Hey, Bobby,
I saw you on TV.

Nice talking to you.

Thank you.

It's you.

You're the stocking killer!

Woman: Oh, my god, it is!

Don't let the bastard get away!

Get him! It's the
stocking killer!

Oh, my god!
Get him!


Come on over, Bobby.

Number 8's waiting for you.

Comstock: It's incredible.

Ratings have gone up 300%,

and it's still rising.

Max: As usual
we have a problem.

It's these stocking killings.

Too sensational, tasteless.

Millicent: Hmm.

Usual crap.

They want a TV debate.

Well, then...

Let's give them one.


TV host: Oh, thank you.
No, really.

Now, listen, I've got that
ringing in my ears

which tells me
that we've got to get

to the serious part of the show.

Let me introduce you
to Sharon tatler

of, uh, mothers against
violent crime.

Get on the stage here,
Sharon, if you can.

That's a lovely dress
you've got on there.

And, of course,
we have Bobby mahon,

who is the star of the,
uh, crimetimeshow!

How about it?!


Right, now listen,

Bobby, let's get
the show rolling.

Um, now I want you to tell me

how do you prepare?

Truth is I don't really prepare.

I like to think of myself
as being... Spontaneous.

Lagrave: There is
some concern

from this side of
the table, Bobby.

I mean, do you...
Do you really believe

that crimetimeneeds
to be so realistic?

I know for a fact
that no one cares.

Bobby: It's what's
happening out there.

Somebody has to stand up
and make people see.

It's hard,

very hard.

I'll be frank with you.

Sometimes I really
don't think I can carry on.

I really and truly don't.

Bobby: Did she cry?

Did she beg?

Now that's my boy.

I try to be as real as I can.

Lagrave: Bobby mahon,

the star of the crimetimeshow!

[Applause and cheering]

Everything's become source
material for entertainment.

On the contrary,

the public really does
want to know the truth.

Oh, come on, Millie.

You don't care about
the monsters.

You just use them.

How do you make him
so horribly normal?

I look for him.

Doesn't it scare you?

Scare me?

Lagrave: Are you
scared, Bobby?

Does it affect you, Bobby?

What?

Why don't you show them, Bobby?

What?

Why don't you show
them? Show them.

Why don't you show them?

Oh!

See, I told you.

I told you.

That's show biz!

Lagrave: Oh, I love you
when you bleed.

I'm sorry?

I said, that's show business.

Am I right, Bobby?

So, how you doing?

Me?

Oh, I'm not so bad.

Not so bad.

I get a little...

Confused sometimes.

Do you get confused, too?

Millicent: You did
well tonight, Bobby.

Where were you
2 months ago, Bobby?

Be happy, Bobby.

This is only the beginning.

You know what you do, Bobby?

You fuck the audience.

They love it.

And now,

you're going to fuck me.

What's happening, Bobby?

Have you been getting
more of those phone calls?

Is that it?

No.

It's all right.

I've got it under control.

I've got everything
under control.

Terry: Now here's
a perfect example

of what I was telling you about.

The Neo-realism of
the florentine school.

don't like this picture.

Oi.

Notice especially
the use of perspective.

Cheerful little
bugger, wasn't he?

Hey, listen, I've
got half an hour.

Let's go somewhere quiet.

Come on.

God, I don't know what I feel.

You know what
he was like before.

Yeah.

He was weird as hell,
and you knew it.

That's why you went out
with him, remember,

because he was exciting.

Yeah, well, now he's different.

He's really starting
to scare me.

Hey, slow down.

You're tired.

It's easy to imagine things.

I didn't imagine the knife.

What knife?

He brought it back from the set.

It's fake, but it looks so real.

He just sits there for
hours playing with it.

It's really scary.

And sometimes I
catch him looking at me.

Get out of there, val.

It's not that easy.

Yes,

it is.
It is easy.

You're just like
one of those stupid women

in a horror movie.

Whatever you do, don't
go down to the basement.

And immediately there you are

in the basement
getting hacked up.

You're a great help.

Well, do yourself a favor.

Chuck him.

He's not worth the grief.

Do you want to stay with me?

I don't want to leave Bobby.

I just want things to be
back the way they were.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Hey, slow down, val.

None of them are worth it.

Yeah, but I love him.

Sidney: Things are
much better, Bobby.

They're going really well.

And don't think I'm not
grateful, because I am.

I just want you to know I
appreciate all that you're doing.

I appreciate all that
you're doing.

No one sees me.

No one sees me.

No one sees me.

[Train rumbles]

Look, you got a problem?

You want something?

Ok, ok.

I've got a moment.

You want something
nice, is that it?

Too shy to ask?

It's ok.

It's fine.

Come on.

I haven't had a big boy like you

inside me for months.

You fucking cunt!

You think you can
fucking freak me out?!

You macho cunt!

Bastard!

You fucking cunt!

Sidney: You bitch.

Look at the mess I'm in.

How do you think
they're gonna do this?

Huh?

Do you think they're
gonna put that on TV?

Think it's gonna be easy?

Did you think?

Oh, no, you didn't think.

You simply did not think.

Oh, shit.

Now look what you've done.

Well, let's see if you can
get this bit right,

you fucking amateur.

[Train rumbles]

Val: Bobby?

Charlie's coming to take
a picture of me

for the exhibition.

Thinks he's got enough now.

[Train rumbles]

Ok.

Are you coming
to Donovan's after?

No, I think I'll stay
here for a while.

Yeah, you stay there

and wait for the next one.

Radio: The prime minister
will not change his tactics

at this late hour.

It's been 10 days now

since the spate of killings

that terrorized the city

suddenly ceased.

Nicknamed "the stocking killer"

by the TV crime
reenactment show crimetime,

this murderer of lonely women

struck almost nightly
over the last few weeks.

Police are baffled.

[Telephone rings]





Hello.

Oh, hi, Walter.

Are you crazy?

Sure I'm interested.

Los Angeles?

Which one did they see?

Oh, right.

The one where I killed her
in the car park.

Yeah, I thought that was
my best one, too.

God, this better happen.

Hey, Walter...

Walter, listen to me
for a minute.

I'm going crazy here.

Yeah, they think he's stopped,

left town, along with my job.

It's like I'm chained up.

The stocking killer
was a freak situation.

The ratings went up,
we all did very well.

But now the killings
have stopped,

ratings going down again.

So you see, Bobby,
it isn't only you.

Looks as if we're
all going to be

out on the street.

I can't believe this.

There's this sicko out there,

and all of our jobs depend on
whether or not he keeps killing.

Yes.

We should've had him
on the payroll.

Oughtn't we?

Come on, what did you expect?

They're always moving on,

looking for something different.

This serial killer takes a rest,

so let's find another one.

Did you think
it was about acting?

Like you were making some
serious dramatic point or something?

Jesus, Bobby, wake up.

You've made your point.

Now give it a
fucking rest, will you?

Why are you talking
to me like this?

I'm only trying to help.

Well, you're not!

Look, I know it
sounds crazy, val,

but I'm out of a job.

He stops killing.

I'm out of a job.

Isn't that sick?

Now some freak is
chopping up pensioners

in everhappy park,

and the whole circus
has moved over there.

It's just difficult
for me to adjust,

that's all.

I'm sorry.

Hey,

I'm sorry.

Come here.

It's been a while since
I've been this close to you

without killing you afterwards.

Will he strike again?

I can't tell you that.

All I can say is that
it's not unusual

for a serial killer
to suddenly erupt

into a spate of murders

and then to resume
a normal life.

We hope that that is
what has happened here.

Jenny: Bobby mahon became
a freak TV personality

when he played
the stocking killer

in crimetime.

In just 8 episodes of crimetime

he received more fan mail

than any other TV personality.

Well, here's what some
people on the street

had to say.

Um, we all think that
Bobby's really cute.

Old lady: I... I never
watch the show myself,

but my friend does,

and she thinks he's dishy.

For god's sake sit down.

You're driving me crazy.

I feel like I'm going

through withdrawal symptoms.

What?

I said I feel like I'm...

Nothing.

Forget it.

Look, it'll be finished
in a minute,

and then we'll talk.

What's the matter?

You've been such
a pain all evening.

Sorry.

Look, I know how you feel.

Do you.

Do you really know how I feel?

Yeah, of course I do.

Do you?

Tell me then.

Bobby.

Tell me how I feel.

I'm asking you a question.

Tell me how I feel.

I don't have to take this.

I'm gonna go home.

See you tomorrow.

Bobby: Oh, that's great.

That's just fucking great,
isn't it?

I need to talk,
and you wanna go home.

It's so easy for you,
isn't it, val?

You wanna talk?

Well, then let's talk.

But you never do, do you?

'Cause you're always
so caught up in yourself

and your fucking work.

My work is every...

Oh, to tell you the truth,

I don't give a shit
about your work.

I'm sick to death of hearing

how fucking wonderful
you were on crimetime.

Get out.

Go on, get out.

Just get away from me.

You should see someone, Bobby.

You should get some help.

Are you still here?

I thought I told you to leave.

You're nothing special,
do you know that?

You're just an actor
riding on a pissy little wave.

Get the fuck out!

If it's so important to you,

why don't you just go and
find some poor lonely woman,

kill her, play yourself on TV,

cut out the middle man.

Get out!

I'm going.

God help you, Bobby.





Yes?

I'm sorry, Bobby.

Sorry I had to stop.

I've really messed things
up for you, haven't I?

Well, I felt I was getting
really close to you, Bobby.

It was wonderful.

Now I... Just feel
we're drifting apart.

I can't seem to see... see
myself clearly anymore.

You'll have to do it
for both of us now.

You can, you know,
Bobby. You can.

You're ready for it.

I'll never be like you.

Well, prove it.

[Music plays]


Do you mind?
Can I join you?

Fuck off, creep.

Do you mind?

Can I join you?

Sure.

Why not?

Well, now you know
everything about me.

Tell me about you.

I work for an insurance company.

My dad, he died.

I'd rather not talk about that.

Yeah.

I haven't been out with
anyone for some time.

Are you hungry?

Would you like to eat something?

Why haven't you
been out with someone?

I don't really...
You know.

I never seem to meet anyone...

Suitable.

I guess real life
isn't like the movies.

All I really know is,
I was pretty...

Well, I was pretty badly
hurt by my last girlfriend.

But you came here tonight.

I couldn't seem to stay at
home on my own anymore.

You know the feeling, don't you?

Yes...

I know the feeling.

Well, we've both been very
brave coming out tonight,

uh, but now it's late,

and I'd better be getting home

before I turn into
a pumpkin or something.

What a beautiful coat.

It was a bit of an extravagance,

but I need it.

I really feel the cold.

Are you catching the bus?

Yes.

Do you want to walk me
to the bus stop?

Look, you'd better go now.

Well, ok.

My bus'll be here in a minute.

Yes, well...

I think I'd better go.

Calm down.

I'm not going to bite you.

Come here.

Mmm...


There...

There. Wasn't
that nice?


What's that smile for?

You look pleased with yourself.

It's nothing.

I really have to go.

No, you don't.

I...

Come on.

I really like you.

Woman: Oh!


[Telephone rings]







Yes?

What?

Another one?

Sweet Jesus.
Where?

Where?!

Seems to have picked this
poor bitch up at the happy hunter.

Saw her to the bus stop.

Bus stop?

Nice to know
chivalry isn't dead.

Good to see you back, Bobby.

Thanks.

Can I see her?

Keen as ever, eh, Bobby?

Be my guest.

Simon: Have to
hurry on this one!

Lots to do!

We're ready for you
now... sir.

It's good to have
you back, Bobby.

Congratulations. You
got what you wanted.

Hi, Bobby.

Hurt your hand?

Oh, yeah.

Came off my bike.

Hit a car.

It's a dangerous
world out there.

Well, we're in luck this time.

A barman actually spoke to him.

What?

Gwenda: Hi, Bobby.

We reckon he must
have been in a rush.

Did a real messy job of the eye.

Must have got blood
all over him.

Look, I'd better see Simon.

Bobby...

This is a great chance for you.

You're gonna meet someone
who actually spoke to our man.

That's him.

I know you.

Bobby mahon.

Blimey! I tell you,
Bobby, you're a dead spit.

You really are.

Simon: When you're
ready, Bobby,

we'll have a run-through, ok?

Yeah, just give me a minute.

Sandy: Bobby!

It's that time again.

Simon: Ok...

Here's what they think.

Now, he pulled her
into the doorway here.

No!

No?

Well, what do you think?

No, nothing.

I just, uh...

Well, it's ok, Bobby.

We're always happy
to listen to your ideas.

So, where's the knife?

All right.
Let's rehearse.

It was in up
through the stomach.

Ok, Bobby?

Ok, Bobby?

Let's go.

Val: Hurry up. I haven't
had my breakfast yet.

He must have been
covered in blood.

Ok, Bobby. Let's
see how it looks.

Come on, Bobby.
Like it's for real.

Why don't you stick it in
and make yourself a star?

Aah!

Unh...


Eww.



Aah!




I can help you, Bobby.

Bobby, are you there?

Yes.

I can help you.

I think we should meet.

[Music plays]

Bobby?

Bobby mahon.

We meet at last.

It's a great moment
for me, Bobby.

Bobby mahon...
The actor... In my home.

Go in, Bobby.

Go in.
Take a seat.

Make yourself at home.

[Music stops]

I don't know why I'm here.

I didn't tell the police.

I don't know why.

Don't you, Bobby?

Oh, what a host I am.

Excuse me.

[Dishes rattling]

Ah, I used to do that
when I was a kid.

All those colors and shapes.

Well, eat up.

You must be hungry
after all your exertions.

What do you mean?

Sidney...

Call me Sidney.

Last night must
have exhausted you.

Why?

You made me so proud.

Look, I came here
because last night I...

Some tea?

What happened?

Well...

You became me, and I,
as you see, became you.

What happened?

Well, you killed her.

You pushed her into that
doorway, and you killed her.

I never did.

I left her, and she was alive.

You killed her.

I saw you cut the eye out.

You were there?

It wasn't the first time, Bobby.

I've followed you many
times, watching over you.

Then you did it!

You must have done it!

You bastard.

You bastard, you did it!

Then what were you doing there

with that sharp knife
in your pocket?

How do you know that?

It's what I would do.

What does it matter, Bobby?

You or I, it's just the same.

You made me, and I made you.

What do you mean, I made you?

Can't you see how?

You wanted to be me,

and I helped you
to become your dream.

You're crazy.

Am I, Bobby?

You are fucking crazy!

Am I crazy, Bobby?

You see?

See, Bobby?

See what happens to our dreams?

Do you see, huh?

Now, what's it matter,
Bobby? You or me?

Ah, now that's it, Bobby.

Now... now you're
getting there, Bobby.

Huh?

You killed her.

You killed all of them.

I couldn't have
done it without you.

Slicing, cutting through muscle,

blood bubbling up in the throat.

I couldn't have done it
on my own, Bobby.

Be brave, huh?

Do it.

Stick it in.

See what it feels like...

For real, huh?

You've wondered,
haven't you, Bobby?

Wondered...
Lying on your bed,

on the set, in the
street, last night.

Last night!

Shut up.

You've wondered
what it feels like

to hear them cry, beg,
try to make deals.

Well, it feels good, Bobby.

It's easy.

I... I don't care, Bobby.
I don't care.

I mean, this is it for me.

There's no place
for me to go now.

No place I want to go.

Shut the fuck up.

Do you think I want
to be like you?

Oh, Bobby, Bobby, why
should you want to be you?

I'm better at being you,

and all the time, you
wanted to be me, didn't you?

You fucking
cunt-murdering bastard!

Look at yourself, Bobby.

No!

That's why you're
here, isn't it?

No, I...

Oh, let me help.

Bobby, Bobby.

Let me go...
Please?

Come on, Bobby...

Be like me.

It's easy.

It doesn't hurt.

Aah!


Bobby! Bobby!

Bobby!

Oh!

Aah! Oh!


You see, Bobby?

Do you see how easy it is?


Bobby. Come on.

Help me.

Bye-bye...

Bye...

Bye-bye... bobby.

Thelma: Sidney?

Thelma: Sidney?

TV: Where you there?

Did you see anything?

Thelma: Sidney, has
your actor friend gone yet?

TV: If you did, phone
crimetimeon 0171-871...

I'm sorry, but...

I never went up to her room.

After Sidney, I just left.

Director: Cut.

Hang on one minute, darling.

Bobby, we've been
through this before.

But it never happened this way.

But it does in this movie.

We're in Hollywood here, Bobby.

So, just do it.

Up.
