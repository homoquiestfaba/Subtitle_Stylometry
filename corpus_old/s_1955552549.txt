Glorious, isn't it?

The sheep that settled here
call it Snow Mountain.

The mastiffs protect the villages
in these parts.

It's a duty their kind has honored
for generations.

[BODI YIPS]
FLEETWOOD: And this here is Bodi.

He may not look like much right now,
but just you wait.

[MUSIC PLAYING]
It's a simple life here.

Make wool. Make music.

[SHEEP SCREAMS]

FLEETWOOD: And that song they're playing,
it's the only one they know.

To me, it's paradise.

And the city I came from
is a distant memory.

[SHEEP SNORING]

FLEETWOOD: But even in paradise,
you can't hide from trouble.

Because where there's sheep,
there's these guys.

Khampa's secret weapon,

[GROWLING]
FLEETWOOD: Deadly Mastiff Paw.


Born of a fire that burns
from deep down inside.

[CHEERING, BLEATING]


FLEETWOOD: Linnux and his gang
were whooped so bad,

we were all sure they were gone for good.

But Khampa figured otherwise.

He built an army.
[INHALES DEEPLY]

And he started training Bodi.

When Bodi could stay focused, that is.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Well, that was the end of music
in the village.

Khampa said that it was a distraction.

That we had to be vigilant.
[SHEEP SOBBING]

[LOCK CLICKS]

Well, things around here
got a whole lot quieter.

[PLUCKING TOVSHUUR STRING]

Until one day...

[GRUNTS SOFTLY]

It's too bad they have to be
locked up like that.

That's for sure.

Aren't you supposed to be somewhere?
BODI: Am I?

Oh! Oh, yeah, right!
See you later, Fleetwood!


You and me will check in later, huh?

SHEEP SENTRY 2: Why are we dressing up

If the enemy thinks there's an army here,
they won't invade.

We've been over this! Come on!
SHEEP SENTRY 3: Oh, that's right!

[SHEEP AGREEING]
I swear, they're like a bunch of animals

that can't think for themselves.

Yeah, yeah.
Well, I'm just gonna go ahead and...

Whoa, whoa, where you going?

You finish your chores?
Yeah.

Shelves are restocked?
Front to back.

Shower drain dewooled?
Did it yesterday.

Towels dried?
Soft and fluffy.

New heads painted?
Double-coated.

What about the time cards?
Sorted.

Now, I... I don't think
I told you about this,

but the punch clock
has been making this...

Squeaking noise?
Oiled it two days ago, sir.

I mean, Dad.

Okay, well, I'll, uh, I'll see you.

[BODI WHISTLING]

KHAMPA: How about your Deadly Mastiff Paw?

[BODI GROANS]

Get the dummy.

KHAMPA: Okay.

Wolf's coming.
Yeah.

He sees you.

Oh, boy. Oh.
Here he comes.

He's coming at you.
Okay.

He's almost on top of you.
Whoo!

He's in your face!
[SHOCKWAVE]

Fail! You took too long, everyone's dead.

Dad, can I just...
Bodi, Bodi, Bodi.

You gotta find the fire inside.

Find that passion.
Yeah.

Okay? Hate the wolf.

Hate wolves. Hate 'em.
There you go.

Can't stand 'em.
Nice.

Wanna just kick 'em!
Use that!

[BREATHING DEEPLY]

[WIMPY ZING]

Yes! Did you see that? Fist pump!
Double fist pump!

I hit the wolf!
[SHEEP SENTRIES] Wolf? Wolf!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Calm down guys! False alarm!

[SHEEP SENTRIES CLAMORING]

You're gonna blow our cover!

RADIO DJ: Another classic from the one
and only Angus Scattergood.

Angus Scattergood.

RADIO DJ: And we have the rock legend
himself on the phone right now.

[GASPS]
Angus, always a thrill.

ANGUS: Well, if you get the thrill,
then everyone's thrilled.

RADIO DJ: So how's your new
single coming along?

ANGUS: New single is good.

Uh, just on the last tweaks.
Mm-hmm

And... and I'm trying just to get back
to my roots.

You know, back to where it all started.

RADIO DJ: Where did it all start?

ANGUS: I got my first six-string guitar
when I was a small cat.

[GRUNTS]
[METALLIC CLANG]

ANGUS: And I got on there
and the music came out,

and the words, you know...

[GUITAR STRINGS RESONATING]

Once I started, there was no going back.

You know, I was just hooked, really.
[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

So then I came down to the city
to Rock 'n' Roll Park,

'cause you know these musicians have taken
the whole thing over, mate.

And I found a band there in need
of a guitar, and then the rest is history.

History and geography
and a little bit of mathematics.

RADIO DJ: Amazing.

So any advice for up and coming musicians?

ANGUS: Play your guts
out and... and never stop.

Even when your dad says,
"Stop!" Don't stop.

[HUMMING SOFTLY]

Dad?
Hmm-mmm.

Got some great news for you.

Got some fabulous news.
Mm-hmm.

I've decided to become a musician.


Did you break into the... [GROANS]

My son, the thief.

I... I know. I'm sorry, but see,
there's this guy named Angus!

And he was telling me
about Rock 'n' Roll Park,

and finding my band.

And it was, like, the answer
to the question of my life, Dad!

Do you understand?
Now I'm gonna have to get a new lock.

Like those things grow on trees
around here.

If you could feel what I'm feeling. Here.

[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

Stop that. Now. Bodi.

That's enough.
Hand it over. Give me the...

[GRUNTING]
Bodi! Give me that! Give me...

Come here!

[OBJECTS CLATTERING]
Hand it to me!

[GRUNTING]
[GUITAR MUSIC CONTINUES]

[DOOR CLOSES]

You're not gonna be a musician, Bodi!

You're gonna be a guard.

Now, when you've come to your senses,
you're going to march down here

and you're going to hand over
that noisemaker,

and we're going to pretend
this never happened! Agreed?

I'll take your silence as a yes.

[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

# Whoo! Yeah! #

# Uh-huh! #

# Yeah! #

[EXCLAIMS, LAUGHS]

# I like it loud I like it tight #

# I like them banging

[BODI WHOOPING]

# That's the way that I like it #

# That's the way that I like it #

# That's the way that I like
my rock and roll #

# That's the way that I like it #

Hey, he's not bad, huh?

I think they call folks like him
"savants."

And it's going to lead
to trouble sooner or later.

My guess is sooner.


# I like the bear barking up on top #

# Beat of the rhythm like
it's never gonna stop #

[TRAILS OFF]

[GROWLS SOFTLY] That boy is really
starting to steam my clams.

Say, isn't he old enough to take the post?

Yeah he is, Floyd,
but he just doesn't take it seriously.

Not since that thing fell out of the sky.

Now it's all rock this and roll that.

And some guy named Dingus.
Yeah,

I guess I was a little like that
at his age.

Had no interest in being a barber.

Had my heart set on astrophysics.

That is until my dad
showed me... The Book.

The Book?
Hang on a sec.

The Book. Real pictures of what can happen

if sheep go too long without grooming.

KHAMPA: Huh... Huh!

[KHAMPA GASPS]

Tell me when you've seen enough.
[EXCLAIMS]

Yep, one look at this scared me straight.

I began my apprenticeship the next day
and never looked back.

"Scared straight." Huh.
Maybe that's what Bodi needs.

Hey, you wanna borrow The Book?
No, Floyd.

I think I've got a better idea.

[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

KHAMPA: Bodi! Bodi! Open this door, son!

[BODI GRUNTING]
KHAMPA: Oh, no, you don't!

BODI: I can't help it, Dad.
The music's in me. It's in me!

Angus says it's like a fever
that takes hold and never lets you go.

You disappoint me, son.

Okay, this is your post.

Get used to it. See you at dawn.

Sunrise?
Yes! Dawn! Sunrise!

First thing in the morning!

End of the night! Come on!
Oh. Okay.



[STATIC CRACKLES]
Ow!

it's me. It's me!

See?
[SHEEP PANTING]

Why are you dressed up like a wolf?

Wow, seriously?
You've all forgotten the plan?

I specifically picked you three

because you're the best and the brightest.

Yeah, for sheep.
Aah!

All right, just put these on.

SHEEP: Hey, look.

Wolf's eating my head.
[LAUGHING]

KHAMPA: There's nothing funny about that.

Okay, Bodi's in position.

On my signal,
we give him the scare of his life.

That was the signal.

[SHUDDERING, PANTING]

Well, all things considered,
it could have been a lot worse.

Oh, yeah.
Yeah, kind of embarrassing,

getting fooled by those
cockamamie wolf getups. [LAUGHS]

Where'd Khampa get the notion
to do a crazy thing like that, anyway?

Hello, Khampa. How's things?

[GROWLS SOFTLY]

Shot of wheatgrass, Sam.


[GLASSES CLINK]
You want to talk about it?

Don't pin this one on me, Fleet.

If he'd been doing his job
guarding the village...

I thought that was your job.

Well, yeah, it is my job,
but I wasn't doing my job.

[EXHALES LOUDLY]

I think you've established that.

Bodi isn't you. He wants to go.

Well, that's just crazy talk.

Who else is gonna guard this place
after I'm gone?

From what? The wolves?

Maybe you're sitting up there waiting
for something that's never coming back.

What if they do, Fleet?

Okay, what if they do?

You think Bodi's gonna be able
to protect the village?

He is who he is.

He's looking for his own paradise.

BODI: Dad?

Just wanted to let
you know I'm ready to...

What's this?

Go to the city.

But if you fail, you come back.

And you never speak of music again.

Okay.

Well, keep those shears sharp, Floyd.

Come back and see us sometime, huh?

Hey.

I hate the big guy.

What about the rest of the army?

You want us to take this guy out?

'Cause I'll take this guy out.
LINNUX: [OVER PHONE] No.

It'll be done in two seconds.
LINNUX: No.

Okay. Whoa, whoa!

He's getting on the bus.
He's getting on the bus!

LINNUX: Well, why are you
still talking to me?

Don't let him out of your sight!
Bring him to me.

We get him, we get Snow Mountain. [LAUGHS]

Get your suit and tie on, Skozz,
we are out of here! Whoo-hoo!

Thanks very much for the bus ride!

Oh, hey, do you know where I can find

Oh, okay. Good talk.

Hi there. Pardon me.

I'm just into town,

I reel him in, you knock him out.

Okay, give me a hand.

Okay. Flip your side around.

No, the other way.

No, not you, Skozz.

I know you did, but when you tell me that,
it makes me want to look.

Do you know what this means? This is fate!

Just like Mr. Scattergood!

Sorry, Angus Scattergood?

Yes! Yes!

Mr. Scattergood came to Rock 'n' Roll Park

and found a band in need
of a guitar player just like you!

This is unreal!

Sorry I'm late, dudes.


I'm Bodi. I'm your new guitar player.

Oh!

Oh, cool. I like that. Okay.
Yeah, you're the new... guitar player.

Well, [SCOFFS] welcome to the band.
Yes!

Oh. Uh, incidentally,
doesn't he have to do

some kind of auditional thing first?

Or am I mistaken?

Oh, Trey...
Well, it's just a formality, really.

Just a little thing we call a "shred-off."

PIG: Shred-off?

TREY:
Yeah, we're gonna have a little shred-off!

[CROWD EXCLAIMING, CHEERING]
CROWD: Shred-off!

[CROWD CHANTING] Shred-off! Shred-off!

What's a shred-off?

Who wants to tell him what a shred-off is?
Well, why don't I tell you?

A shred-off is just a little thing
where you play a lick,

and then I get to play a lick
and then you get to be in the band.


You betcha!

he comes and goes.

I'm Darma. [CHUCKLES]
Bodi.

I was so sure this was the band.
Hey, you're gonna find one.

It doesn't just happen overnight,
you know.

I mean, we've been playing
in this park for, like, years.

Wow. Mr. Scattergood sure made it sound
easy on the old magic singing box.

The... magic... singing box?

Yeah. Fell out of the sky. Almost hit me.

Oh!

That happened to you, too?
BODI: Yeah.

My brother.

I'm... I'm sorry. Did I hear you guys?

You guys are talking about
Angus. Scattergood.

Yeah?

Well, did you know that the dude
lives here in town?

Really?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! [GRUNTS]

I think you ought to go up and meet him.

In fact, I insist that you do.

Ask him to give you some guitar lessons.
You could use them.

Oh, no. No, no. You can't just go talk

to Angus Scattergood...
Oh, sure he can.

You march on up there,
big old white house on top of the hill,

can't miss it,
and you tell him old Trey sent you.

Well, okay!
I've always wanted to meet him.

And one more thing!

Don't forget to kiss the gate!
It's good luck!

Kiss the gate, got it! Thanks!


What?

TOUR GUIDE: [ON PA] And to your right is
the home of rock legend Angus Scattergood.

Each year, thousands of wannabe musicians

It's done.

Then send it now!

ANGUS: There's a tweaky-tweak

IAN: You've been tweaking for six months!

Yeah, well, you know, I'd be finished now

you are in very deep trouble, Angus!

IAN: Well, we're going to stick by you.

For now.
Oh, for now?

That sounds like a threat, Ian.

A threat of violence. And murder.

You're down to three days to turn this in.

Well, I don't need three days, mate...
Well, actually I do.

See there's this band and they're really...

Otherwise you're just

I'm gonna meet my gator-maker!

Nice. Thank you.

LINNUX: [OVER PHONE]
So where's the mastiff?

It didn't come together.

LINNUX: Didn't come together?
What is this, a jigsaw puzzle?

A standard kidnapping
is too much for you two?

Well, we were this close,
but he gave Skozz the slip.


Yeah, that guy's crafty.

Okay, you knuckleheads,

you're going to scour every square inch
of this city. Eyes peeled.

I don't want you to blink
until you find him.

You know what? I'm not blinking already.
[LINE DISCONNECTS]

Hello? Hello? [SIGHS]

What, you didn't get one for me?

That's messed up, Skozz.

Oh, my gosh!

I'm actually meeting
Angus Scattergood's... gardener!

This is so... Sorry.
Let go of me, you stupid mutt.

Sorry. Could you give Mr. Scattergood
a message from me?

I'll give him a message, all right!

Oh, I will tell
Mr. Scattergood all about you!

But he will never ever

Don't you run with me.

Why are they all chasing us?

Because I...
because I am Angus Scattergood!

Whoa! What?
I knew you were Angus Scattergood!

Hey, what do you think about
maybe becoming my music teacher?

I'm not going to be
your music teacher, mate!

Will you just think about it?
Look, when I count to three,

you go off to the right
and I'll carry on in this direction, okay?

One, two, three.
Okay.

Can't do it.

You're still following me, you big twit!

Wow!

Are you sure about that?

Because there's plenty of food in here.
It's really good.

Eating food in a dumpster.

This is what he said would happen.

I mean, here I am with Angus Scattergood.

Yeah, I know I said
I was Angus Scattergood,

Mother.

Why'd they have to use that photo?
Great picture.

Nah, I don't...
Such a cool picture.

I did not sign off on that photo, so...

Okay, I'm just going to quickly hug you.
No! Don't you touch me!

I heard you on the magic box
and you changed my life!

Well, you have quite ruined mine, mate.

So you know what? Just...

Just give us a fiver for a cab,
and we'll call it quits, all right?

Yeah? A fiver? Just...

You lend me five of them.
Five of the one things.

Oh, money? Yeah! No.

No, I know where we can get money, yeah.
Lots of it.

Hey, Mr. Scattergood! We made a penny!

Shh! Don't you understand
what "incognito" means?

Um, just a button. Wasn't a penny.

Sorry about that, Mr. Scattergood.

Don't use the name!

Just make me enough for a cab fare,
all right?

We got him this time.

Come on, Skozz, let's go pull around

Just a button.

Just a button?

Yep. One button.
It's a good start, though.

Give me that swamp fiddle thing.

Can you give me a bit of space here?

Oh.
Just back up a bit.

How's this?

Okay, how 'bout now?

Get in the hedge.

BODI: I can't see you!

Perfect!

DARMA: Bodi?
Oh, hey, Darma.

Are you okay?

Yeah, yeah. I've just been, uh,
hanging out with Mr. Scattergood.

Whoa, whoa! Sorry. Back up.

You've been hanging with rock legend,
Angus Scattergood?

Uh, yup.
GERMUR: Right on.

Hanging with Angus.
He was not hanging.

Hangus with Angus.

Really. We've been together all day.

Let's see...

We went jogging.

Then we had some pizza.
DARMA: Right.

[ANGUS YELLING]...hey! Come on!
Then we came here to the park 'cause,

you know, he needs a little money
for a cab.

Of course.
ANGUS: Help me! Help me!

He's right over there.
You guys want to meet him?

Yeah. Yeah, we do.

Yes, that's a great idea.
Let's all just go meet Angus!

Sweet! We're meeting Angus!
Don't get your hopes up.

Hey! What's going on...


And here he is, Mr.... Mr. Scattergood?

Woo-wee! We did it! We did it!

He was right here.
I don't know what happened.

I don't know where he went.

I believe you, dog.
You do?

I do what? What do I do?

Look, Bodi, you know, you don't have
to make stuff up to impress us.

What? No, no. He was right here.
I gotta find him.

Mr. Scattergood! Where are you?

Mr. Scattergood! Hey! Where'd you go?
Oh...

He's cute.

Completely delusional, but cute.

Shut up! Just shut up!
Who's in charge here? You? Large lad?

I will call you... "Large Lad."

You stupid, bloody idiot,
you know who I am?

You're in a lot of trouble, mate.
And the entire world

is going to be beating down your door
like... like salmon

trying to go up a... a stream
when it's mating season.

Not a good analogy. Anyway. Look, just...
[THUMPS]

You know what?
You two morons just lost your health plan.

And your 401Ks.

And if you don't bring in that mastiff
by the end of the week,

I'm relocating you to new digs
with bottom-of-the-oceanfront views.

Am I clear?
Bottom of the oceanfront, got it.

Now get outta my sight.

Give Mr. Scattergood a ride home.

Ooh! When I get ahold of your kid,
you're not going to know what hit you.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

I know that was you, Feng!
FENG: Sorry.

Ethel, the headpiece goes on last

No. I... I... I think that's...

I think that's a foreleg you have

It's a left.

No. The other left.
Oh. This one?

Oh, my goodness. Hey, Phil. Phil!

For the nine billionth time,

When did this happen?

Do you really not remember?

You gave him a going away party,

I wish I knew.

You know what kind of a fool you made me

We supposed to be a team, Skozz.
We supposed to be a team.

Welcome, welcome.

Uh, Bo... Bodee? Bohdee?
Bodi, yes!

Bodi!
I can't believe you remember my name.


Now, what was it you were after?

Music lessons, yeah?
Yes.

Come. Come on in, mate.
Don't step on the welcome mat.

And don't touch the door,
it's electrified.

This is Ozzy.
Wow!

Yeah, just... Wait.
Oh, wow!

Just leave the robot alone for the moment.

Hello, Ozzy! My name is Bodi!

That's it... That's it, mate.
So, music lessons?

BODI: Wow!

Boy, I've... I've never seen
anything like this.

My... My whole village could fit in here.

ANGUS: Yeah, yeah, it could, mate. Yeah.

What's that?

That's my old tour bus.

I've been to the moon
and back in that thing.

And here is... Here is the library...

BODI: Whoa!

Yeah.
Mr. Scattergood.

lndeedyweedy, mate.

You want to be a rock musician?
You've got to have the proper ax.

Just go ahead, pick one. Any one.

Oh!

[ETHERIAL MUSIC]

Wait!

Don't... Don't touch.
You see, that is a Scattercaster, you see?

Only one in the entire universe.

Crafted by Celtish people
from the timbers of a Viking ship

and presented to Saxons
by the Romans, I think it was.

Wow!
So not that one.

Okay. How... How 'bout that one?
No, no. Not that one.

Well, this one I like...
No, no. Not that one.

Okay. Well,
I like the color of this one...

No, no. Just...
I lost the keys to that one.

Ah!

[GRUNTS]
[OBJECTS CLATTERING]

What about this one?

It makes you look like a rock star.

So what do we learn first?

Chords? Fingering? Strumming techniques?

That's boring stuff.
Really, to be honest, boring.

I'll teach you that later in the lesson.
Necessary, but boring.

Best to start off with songwriting.

Have you ever composed?

I have this one little something
about a garbage truck.

Can you play it?

Yeah, I can give it a shot.

[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]
[BODI OFF-KEY]

# I'm so stuck in this garbage truck #

# I just wanna get myself out #

Wait... That's good.

But stop it for the moment. Ah...

Waste management, mate.

It's not very rock 'n' roll is it,
you see?

Pardon me?

You've got to write something that's going
to resonate with the masses.

You mean, like, something that makes
people feel good.

Yes! So reach inside yourself...
Wh... where did you come from, mate?

My... my town's called Snow Mountain.
ANGUS: What's that make you feel like?

Uh...

What's the word? Uh...

Disgusted?
No...

Uh, entrapped?
Not really.

Angry? Bitter?
Uh...

Judgmental?
Not quite.

One horse?
No.

Anti-cat?
I got it!

Glorious.

Glorious? Yeah. That'll do.

That's what you were.
You were totally on fire!

You were in the zone!

Did you feel it?
I did feel it!

I felt it. I felt it... You blew up my
room!

You blew up my room!

I'm sorry, Mr. Scattergood!

It doesn't matter. It does not matter.

Nothing to worry about, all right?

The song... is done. It is done.

BODI: So, that's the lesson?

ANGUS: Yeah it is.

I've ever given.

Watch the welcome mat. There you go.

So when should I come back?

[FLAPS LIPS] Is that...

For our second lesson? Is tomorrow good?

Why, um...
that's gonna be... It's tricky, uh,

really slammed stuff, you know,
on the calendar-wise, you know.

But we, we could...
I'll get my people to...

But, you know, we'll work out something.

Okay. Well,
I guess I'll just go over to the park.

Great, great, mate. Just, uh...

There you go, mate! Mind the mice!

Okay! Well, goodbye!

You're not gonna believe it!

Mr. Scattergood gave me a music lesson!
And we wrote a song together!

He even let...
GERMUR: Whoa! Hey...

RADIO DJ: On the line, right now,
He's on! He's on!

RADIO DJ OVER RADIO: Angus, tell us...
Tell us about your new single.

[ANGUS OVER RADIO]
It's been a long time coming,

and everyone's been saying,
"When's it coming?"

And here it is, baby, out tomorrow.

And it is called "Glorious."

Yeah, "Glorious!"

That's the song we did!
[ROCK PARK MUSICIANS] Shh. Shh. Quiet!

RADIO DJ: So, uh, what inspired you?

ANGUS: Uh, well, funny story.

I was sitting in my studio
and the bell rang.

Yep. That was me.
ANGUS: Which almost never happens.

I go to the door
and there was nobody there.

What?

ANGUS: But I looked up,
and I thought of where I grew up.

Up in the mountains where...
Uh, where the snows are.

And I thought, "This is glorious, mate.
It's just glorious."

And it came... came straight
from the heart.

From, uh, my heart, to be clear.
That was from my heart.

RADIO DJ: That's beautiful.

ANGUS: Well, I'd be remiss if I didn't
acknowledge

someone who was there for me,

and without whom this song
would not have been written.

And that person
of course is my butler, Ozzy.

And he, in his own way, he is glorious.

Or not glorious.
What's a better word for it?

Square-shaped.
[STEREO CLICKS]

Uh, he didn't mention you. Why not?

Oh, that's right
'cause the dude doesn't know you exist!

IAN: Yeah, what is that? What is that?

It's finished.
IAN: The song... The song's finished?

Two hours to spare.
IAN: Yes!

Okay, don't move. I'm going to send
a runner over right away.

We're going to pick it up.
We're going to have a big party tonight!

I'm going to rent us a hotel, okay?
Yeah, make it two hotels, okay?

IAN: That's really not in our budget...
Yeah, ginormous party, all right.

We can't do that... Angus?
All right, cheers, mate.

[EXHALES DEEPLY]

What?

Why are you looking at me like that?

Is this about that daft dog?

Come on, he'll be fine.

He'll be fine!

Look, truth is,

I could've written that song
without that dog.

All right, I could not have written
that song without that dog.

But...

It's not like I can go around
telling people the truth.

I'd lose it all, man.
I'd lose the legend...

Maybe I should give
him a little something,

for the inspiration, yeah?

Is that a good idea?

Will you stop!
You're like a stone, you are!

You stare at me with your big,
tin eyes and your big, tin face.

You tin thing!

Ozzy! That tin can.

Blackmail! It's not blackmail,
is it, technically.

It's a... it's a guilt trip.

Whoa. Check it.

Don't like them.

I'll do it. All right. Come on!

There you go.

Just a little something from me,

From me to you.

Just signed the back of it, you see?

That was your plan?

You complete and utter goat!

[KHAMPA PANTING]

What?

WOLVES: Get back here.


Whoa!

Get back here.
Get back!

[KHAMPA GRUNTING]


WOLVES: There he is!

[WOLVES GROANING]

RIFF: No, he ain't gonna...

Whoa!
[THUDS]



Cut him down.

You know what?
I left my switchblade in the car, so...

[WOLF LAUGHING MANIACALLY]

Bodi.

Now, about that fire?

This would be a good time.

[LINNUX SCREAMING]

I love you, son.

Well played, mate.

Angus!
[ANGUS EXCLAIMS]

DARMA: Bodi!
All right, Bodi!

SHEEP 1: That was incredible.
SHEEP 2: That's how you shred!

Oh, don't worry about me.
They'll untie me sooner or later.

My guess is later.

The important thing is what's going on
right there.

Yeah, it's only worked one other time!

And I have a hunch that things around here

are gonna get a whole lot louder.

# After searchin', tryin' to find you #

# I thought I lost my luck #

# But I never thought in a million years #

# That you would just walk right up #

# Ooh-ooh... #

Ian? Ian? Can you hear this?

# I could never let you down... #

I think they're pretty good, man.

I think you should look in to them.

# Even when the times get rough... #

That's my guitar solo!
I gotta do a guitar solo. Gotta go! Bye!

# We'll grow old #

# and we'll never be alone #

# And no matter where we roam #

# We'll be glorious #

# We'll be glorious
and you know it's true #

Come on, dude, check the list again.
I'm with the band. I introduced them.

[GRIZZ ROARS]

# Now we're glowing
like a fire illuminating from within #

# So we keep on climbing higher #

# To the sky we're going we've never been #

# Oooh-oh #

# Now that we set us free #

# Nothing's gonna hold us down #

# And even when the times get rough #

# We'll never lose the fight in us #

# We'll grow old and we'll never be alone #

# And no matter where we roam #

# We'll be glorious #

# We'll grow old #

# And we'll never be alone #

# And no matter where we roam #

# We'll be glorious #

# We'll be glorious
and you know it's true #

[SHOCK WAVE]

# You and I are never gonna rest #

# Keep up the dream
like it's life or death #

# And you and I we're never giving in #

# Never giving in ever giving in #

# And you and I we're never gonna rest #

# Keep up the dream
like it's life or death #

# And you and I we're never giving in #

# Never giving in #

# We're never giving ever giving #

# We'll grow old #

# And we'll never be alone #

# And no matter where we roam #

# We'll be glorious #

# We'll grow old #

# And we'll never be alone #

# And no matter where we roam #

# We'll be glorious #

# We'll be glorious you know its true #


# Hey! #
