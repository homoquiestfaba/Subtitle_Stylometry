[CLATTERING, THEN THUD]

Fuck, man.


[COWS LOWING]


Goddamn it!


We've had days where we've done
six of these in one day.

Six?
Six of them.

Just me and Matt before...
When he was around more.

Oh, man.
Yeah.

Sometimes people ask me, you
know, "Can I buy half a pig?"

"Can I get some of that?"

So I raise an extra one for a
family member or a close friend.

Right.
And, uh, we make a few bucks.

Now, the absolute
most important thing ever...

is the bile sac.

The bile sac?
Yeah.

If you were to break that...

It's such...
It's like yellow, ugly shit

that will taint the meat
and make it not edible.

Right.
So you...

It's really critical,

so I don't know
if you feel like it,

but if you don't mind
holding this.

Got you.

Yeah.
Got it?

Yeah, I got it.
We're good.

[SAWZALL WHIRRING]


Sawzall!
Goddamn!

MAN: I got it. I got my
green shot right there.

J-rod, motherfucker!
What's up, brother?

How you doing, baby?
It's been a while.

Yeah, man.
Good to see you.

What's up? Merc.
How's it going?

It's good to meet you.
Good to meet you!

BOB: You won't believe what he
helped me with. It was fucked up.

HERNAN:
It's right there. Try it.

They're serving up the other
ones, the green ones.

No pork on my fork,
but have at it.

Cheers.

To <i>la finca.</i>

What?
<i>La finca,</i> the farm.

<i>La finca.
Salud!</i>

<i>La finca!</i>

I didn't know that one.

BOB:
So here's the deal.

I just went into the bathroom...

I swear to God, bro.

I swear this to God.

I go in the bathroom...

to go to the bathroom.
I feel this thing on me...

Number one or number two?
Number one.

I'm feeling this thing on me,
and I'm getting really nervous,

and I'm, like, okay,
it's pretty big.

For real.

Bob, look.
Dude! It was...

I had a bloated tick
on my something!

[MAN GROANS]

A what?
A tick!

It was buried in me
on my something.

MERCURY: What's this...? Time-out.
What the fuck is a "some-tine"?

MAN: A something.
His freaking "something."

MERCURY: Your dick?
MAN: Yeah, man.

You had a tick on your dick?
On my dick! I did.

How did you not know this?

I didn't know because they're
pretty cool at what they do.

They're quiet.
They don't go:

[IMITATES CHOMP]

Did you, would you, could you?

I'm, like, oh, my God.
Oh, yeah, Bob.

[MEN LAUGH]

So far, so good. We good, man.
Yeah.

Goddamn, Bob.
Goddamn, man.

You high, man?
Yeah. Yeah.

[MEN LAUGHING]

Hi, this is, uh,
Mercury Maxwell.

I'm staying down at the house.

I just wanted to let you know

that we had a tree
fall down today.

And, uh...

it's in the backyard,
but give me a call when you can.


Shit!

[LADDER RATTLING]



What up? What up?
It's your boy, Money Merc.

Live from the middle
of the fucking woods...

working on this new album
right quick, man.

Don't know where the fuck
I'm at,

at an undisclosed location,
but let me show y'all, though.

Hold on. Let me see...
Unh...

Out here, baby.

Out here.
What you know about that?


Nah, I ain't no country boy,
but it's cool out here though.

I'm fucking with it.
Like I said,

I'm just getting
some new vibes for the album.

You know, new shit going down.
Don't even trip.

"When can I come to Brazil?"

Shit, anytime.

Y'all got that ass in Brazil.

You already know, shit.

"I'm a 14-year-old rapper
with sick beats and hard rhymes.

Shout me out, Lil' Stank."

Lil' Stank, that's your name,
my nigga?

Do you shit on yourself?
Do you wear diapers, mofo?

What the fuck is a Lil' Stank?

I'm fucking with it though.

Keep grinding though.
Go check out Lil' Stank.

"You soft as hell.
Just telling you how it is."

You bitch-ass nigga.
Where the fuck you from, man?

Ohio or some shit like that?

Monkey-ass nigga, man.

Motherfuckers always coming in
here, talking shit,

but it's crazy 'cause when y'all

see a motherfucker
on the street,

it'd be all smiles.

But it's all good though.

"Lil' AK-47 son'd you
in the new video."

Fuck AK-47, man!

How the fuck AK-47 son'd me
and I'm the father of this shit?

Man can't "son" me.

Nigga's a bitch. Fuck blood.

It's all good, man.

I ain't got to respond
to bitch-ass niggas like that.

Like I said, album on the way,

we flaming that fuck-boy
on every track.

It's going down.
I ain't worried about shit.

You already know
how Blood Money Merc do

when I get in that mode, so...

It is what it is. Anyway, man.

Album on the way, man.
I'm checking out. Peace.

[SIGHS SOFTLY]

[COUNTRY MUSIC
PLAYING SOFTLY OVER SPEAKERS]

MICHAELE: Okay, fine. I
got it. I'm going on break.

Hey, yo! Excuse me. Shit.

Can you help me?
Sure.

I got a leak in the kitchen
of this house I'm renting,

and, uh...
I need a P-trap,

and I don't know
if I need "1 1/4" or "1 1/2".

Okay, I think...
It's for the kitchen, so...

It could be either.

I think it just depends
on the sink. Oh, shit.

I should have brought
the pipe in here.

Um...

You can get both and return
whatever you don't use.

Yeah, I guess I got to do that.

My husband's a logger.
He uses these.

Yeah?
You a logger?

Eh, not quite.
Okay.

Hm.

You look familiar.

Were you in the movies?
Nah.

TV?

I make music. I'm a rapper.
Oh, really?

Yeah.

Can I ask you a question?
What's that?

What's the difference
between hip-hop and rap?

Uh, like rap is like the music,
the sub-genre of it,

and hip-hop is like
the whole culture, I guess.

So hip-hop is more
like the young kids do

and rap is for seasoned?

Um, I mean, I don't really think
it has an age bracket on it.

Think everybody
kind of loves it, you know?

Okay.

Jill, could you switch with Sue?

Like, just change spots.
All right.

That is significantly better.

Everyone smile.
Okay, good.

Three, two, one.
Cheese!

[MUSIC TRACK PLAYING]

â™ª Unh. Seven more colors of this
When it goes off â™ª

â™ª Unh. Seven new colors of this

[RAPPING INDISTINCTLY]

[MUSIC TRACK CONTINUES PLAYING]

[CRICKETS CHIRPING]

[VIDEO CALL RINGING]

<i>You didn't kill that pig.</i>
I did.

The nigga asked me to help him

slaughter the pig and I did it.

What the fuck? It wasn't shit.

I thought it was gonna be
a big deal, but it wasn't.

It actually was easy.

<i>All right.
Well, whatever it takes.</i>

<i>As long as you're not isolating.</i>

<i>I want to make sure
you're feeling right,</i>

<i>feeling ready
to get back into writing.</i>

<i>'Cause you've been up there
three weeks now.</i>

<i>I'll give you another month,
but...</i>

Ain't no motherfucking
timeline, nigga.

How are you going to tell me
you're gonna give me a month?

Y'all can't rush this shit, man.

Y'all keep always trying to turn
a motherfucker creativity

on and off like a light switch.
It don't work like that.

You know what I'm saying?

I'm tired... <i>I hear you.</i>

I'm tired of this rap shit
anyway.

What if I don't
turn the album in?

<i>No, no.</i>

What if I don't even
turn the album in?

They gonna sue me?

<i>The label's a bitch, right?</i>

<i>But it's a bitch we both got
to deal with on some level.</i>

<i>Let me handle them.</i>

<i>Don't be even thinking
about that.</i>

<i>I just want your truth.</i>

<i>Whatever magic happens
up in that place</i>

<i>with you being sort of away</i>

<i>from all that's been
stressing you out,</i>

<i>that's what I want
to hear about.</i>

<i>I just don't want you sinking
into the mental space</i>

<i>you were in
before I sent you up there,</i>

<i>you know what I mean?</i>

<i>The whole point
of being up there</i>

<i>is to get out of that head.
I know.</i>

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

I'm surprised. You just...

You know, when you were little,

I had to drag you outdoors.

What am I going to do
in the projects of Chicago,

go outside and get shot?
Yeah.

This is a little different.

Yeah, it's definitely different.

Just good to get
some fresh air, you know?

Kind of hit mute on
everything. Mm-hm.

Nobody out here,
not a nigga in sight.


Only thing you got to worry
about out here is them bears.

What bears?
Bears all around.

What, here?
Yeah.

You said you wanted
to go on a hike.

But you didn't say nothing
about no bears!

Nah, don't hold me.
If a bear get on you, hey...

Hey, Mama, I love you,
but if a bear jump out,

it's every man for themselves.
Uh-uh.

I know you got my back.

Seriously,
there are no bears out here.

If they come out, just ball up
in the fetal position.

Then they won't... They might
not do nothing to you.

That's what I heard.

Bob tell you that?
Nah.

All right, so is it hot?

I'mma put some of these onions
in if it's hot.

I don't like onions.

But you need them,
so let's run with it.

Since when don't you
like onions?

It ain't my thing.
I don't like the texture.

You've eaten onions.

You don't even know
when the onions are in there.

I don't like the texture
of onion. Back up.

Back it on up!

Back up. All right.

I'm just gonna put
half the onions in here.

Okay. Just 'cause I
don't wanna hear it.

It's your world.
It's your world, shawty.

It's your world.

BLOGGER [OVER SPEAKER]:
<i>He's a bitch! He's a bitch-made bitch.</i>

<i>If that album says anything
about fucking drugs,</i>

<i>hos, bitches, and fucking
selling crack, fuck that,</i>

<i>because you're out
in the fucking woods!</i>

<i>There's no fucking way
that you're fucking real!</i>

<i>Come to the fucking hood.</i>

Come on, Mama. What's up?

<i>If you're a fan of his,
comment down below. Whatever.</i>

Where you on your way to?

I'mma stop back down at Aunty's

and, uh, pick my stuff up,

then I'm gonna head on
back to my house.


Good old Evans ton.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

Who could've thought?

Ain't got a lot of our kind
out there, that's for sure.

I love my house,

and I love the new people
I'm getting to...

That's good. That's good.

Surprised?

Everybody need a change
of scenery from time to time.

How many Black farmers you know?

None.
Exactly.

How many Black people you know
producing and,

you know,
cultivating their own food?

None.
There ain't a lot.

No.
Exactly.

You know?
Look at you.

Just a thought, you know?
Just...

[ROOSTER CROWING]


[LOCK HONKS]

Bob?

Big Bob, what up, playboy?
BOB: Merc!

I don't know, man.
I'm beat.

How you doing, man?

Good. I'm chilling.
Good to see you.

I don't know, man,
just having a tough morning.

Got so many animals,
it's driving me nuts.

I got cows,
three of them had babies.

I got to have three more.
They'll go any minute.

I got 16 turkeys.

I got 35 broiler chickens
I got to hang up on Monday.

I got laying hens...
and some doves.

And then I got to find some way
to go up the road

and cut 25 trees on the ground
to make some money.

That sound like a lot shit, man.
Need some help?

You don't have to help me.
You helped me last week.

I know, man, but, you know,

[SUCKS TEETH]

I'mma be here for a minute,
so...

I figured I might as well, you
know, come give you a hand.

My grandfather used
to have farmland.

I'd be lying to you if I said
I wasn't interested in it.

So, you know, me helping you
is like helping me.

What you say?

The fuck?

me get this in these buckets.

Or this bucket, anyway.
Man, what is this shit?

Pig food, man.

Pig food?
I know,

it's too good for them, huh?

You got bagels, French toast,
Ring Dings. You kidding me?

Honey buns.
Yodels.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

Pancakes.
Pancakes?

Fucking pancakes, dude. Yeah.
That's crazy.

Yeah.

Throwing away all this
good shit, man.

I know, but at least
it's outdated.

And nobody gets to use it
'cause they can't sell it.

As soon as it's one day old,

they say, no,
you got to get rid of it.

I've been lucky
for almost a year now,

getting this from them, and
they're going out of business.

Outdated?
Yeah, it sucks.

Tastes good though, right?
Tastes all right to me.


All right, motherfuckers!
Let's get it. Let's get it.

Oink, oink, oink, oink.

Motherfucker!
Oink, motherfucker.

Come on, oink, motherfucker.

Come on. Let's get this shit.

There we go, yeah!

Yeah!

Come on. Fuck with me.
Fuck with me. Oink, oink.


Motherfucker!

BOB: Sounds like the
turkeys are liking you too.

Bacon, motherfucker.
I want some turkey bacon next!

They're liking it.
You got to give me new shoes.

This shit getting my shit
all fucked up.

Do it on my own?

What the fuck you talking about?

You consult with me.
That's why I'm calling you.

Consult? I don't have

I ain't afraid of you.

You can put your hands on me,
do whatever you want.

I'm not gonna leave.

I'm here for you, bro!

I hate to say it.
I hate to see it.

You're going to lose everything.

I'm here for your houses.

You live on credit, like the
rest of these motherfuckers do.

I'm here for your car.
I'm here for your mom's house.

We worked so fucking hard
to get that house!

Now, I'm not supposed
to bring this up but, yo,

you got child support
payments, bro.

Where's your shit? I'm saying,
send me a dummy track.

Send me something stupid,
just so I can satiate them,

just so they'll calm down.
They're breathing down my neck.

Then I wake up, and fucking,
yo, "I'm quitting,

I'm never fucking coming back,"
whatever this fucking...

I got the press calling me
and I can't even talk to you?

I can't even get you
on the phone to say:

"What is this about?
How do I explain this?"

You're lucky I didn't put out
a statement on your behalf

without consulting you.

Take your time. But deliver.

You got to focus.
You have a goal here.

That's why we're up here.

I know you're not up here
for the weather, bro.

Whatever, you made a friend.

Good, I'm glad
you made a friend.

But that's a distraction
right now.

If you ain't Money Merc,
who are you?

I'm hungry as fuck.

I'm going inside.

I'm gonna get myself a sandwich.

And we got to sit down

and fucking talk

Don't push it, bro.

You ain't gonna look like this.
You're right.

You'll be an old,
fat motherfucker.

Leave him alone, Bob.

No, let me just say something
right here.

When I turn 98,
I hope I look just like you.

All right?
You look good.

You ever see anything like this?
What are you showing us?

But, you know,

It's cool.
Yeah?

There it is.

Yeah.

Well, learn it. It's 300.

[FIRE CRACKLING]

Hi, how are you?
I'm all right.

What are you looking for?
Uh, snow shovels.

We don't have them stocked yet.
Oh, yeah?

No.
It must not be cold yet.

Something else
I can help you with?

Oh, I'm just gonna
browse around.

What's up?

What are you looking at,

you Larry-David-looking
motherfucker?

You're fucked up, man.

Hey.
Oh, you at work today, huh?

Yeah. Middle of the
week, just at work, huh?

Hi.

What's going on? How you been?
Good. How are you?

I'm good. I'm just chilling.

I'm about to take a break.
You wanna go?

How you spell your name?

It look like, Michelle-a...

Michelle.
Why do they call you Michael?

I love talking about how to
spell my name and say my name.

Nobody ever asks me,
so thank you.

Your parents
must have wanted a boy.

They must have.

I feel like they were
disappointed in many ways.

Yeah.

Mm. How you liking country life?
It's cool.

I've been learning a lot
on the farm with Bob.

Uh-huh.

Yeah. My granddad
used to have a farm.

Like down south in Mississippi,
or something, but...

Got you.

My family never, like,

took me to meet him,
or anything like that,

so I don't really know
too much about him.

Now you're exploring
your farming roots.

Heh.
Heh.

Something like that.

Damn.
I guess you could say that.

Ooh...

I can't wait to get out
of this fucking town.

Yeah, and go where?
Anywhere.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Anyway...

You really need that,
uh, snow shovel?

That, uh-uh...?
What?


Maybe when the snow hit,
I'll come back and get it.

Okay. You were coming to...
Yeah.

...window-shop today?

Maybe.


Should I get your number?

You think I just give
my number out like that?

Oh, okay.
Who do you think I am?

So next time you come
to look at snow shovels,

maybe we can talk about
if you wanna hang out then.

Got you.

Nice to see you.

Let's try and do some...

'Cause that shit sounds

I'm just saying that...
What you're rapping about.

My last record?

Yeah.
When was your last?

That beat is good. It's okay,

but really, I'm making the beat.

I'm doing what I'm doing to...
I mean...

I'm enhancing you.

When was your last shit?

It's only...

Really?
I mean...

That's where
we're going with it?

I'm just saying, like,

let's do something
that's a little different.

Nigga, you're just
like all these...

We could just...
We could, I mean...

All y'all motherfuckin'
white boys in the industry

always trying to make
a nigga change his style.

I mean...

The fuck going on, man?
That's dope too, but...

Why you want me to change
my motherfucking style, nigga?

The shit that got me here
got me here.

I'm saying, we just go,
like, a little left.

Maybe we need to go a little
different on the beats.

Well, you know...

Like you said, man,
niggas trying to make hits.

Yeah, but, I mean, hits...

You know, hits ain't coming
from the same...

We can't follow the same
formula and then it's a hit.

You know? You already had hits.
It's the same shit.

The shit I've been doing

been putting them plaques
on the wall.

All right. The cars in the
motherfucking driveway.

The houses on the lot.

You got me fucked up, Leon.
I'm out.

Show your way out, dawg.
You got some weed?

I got weed.
Get the fuck out.

Get the fuck out.

I don't feel like rapping
right now, dawg.

I just need some space
from that shit.

I don't know, maybe when...

I don't know. I don't know.
Just right now, I'm...

I ain't in it.

It ain't in me, you know?
Mm-hm.

If you do the fucking...
The shit will come back.

This shit comes and goes.
You've gotta give it some time.

That's the thing, Leon.

I ain't got a lot of time
in this shit.

It's like once a nigga
go over 30,

they start looking at you
like a dinosaur,

you know what I mean?

It's definitely a young nigga's
game right now.

I mean...

You can change that.
But I don't know.

That doesn't seem true
all the time.

As long as you
keep making good music,

you could go forever.

Yeah, I feel you.

Shit, man, aside from that, man,
this shit dangerous as fuck too.

Mm-hm.
What fucking other job in music

do you gotta worry
about getting shot?

If I was a motherfucking
country singer,

you think niggas would wanna
take my jewelry, nigga?

Nah.

Fucking rap, man.

I got into this rap shit
to get...

away from the streets.

It seem like
this shit's just bringing me...

ten times closer to it.

So that tweet,
that shit was real, then?

I don't know.

I don't know.

Oh, okay.
Thank you.

All right.
Playing doctor, all right.

Playing house.

Cheers.

Thanks for having me.
It's all good.

I wonder if there's something

like a wolf or a grizzly bear
or some shit like that.

[MICHAELE CHUCKLES]

Yeah, there is, actually.

Yeah?
Yeah.

There's bears
and coyotes and snakes.


I ain't fucking with that.
Fisher cats.

What?
Fisher cats.

What the fuck is a fisher cat?

Ooh. I'm so sorry to be
the one to tell you this,

but there are these wild cats.

They're big, and they're very
ugly, and they're very mean.

And they kill other adorable
house cats by fisting them,

pulling out their intestines
and eating them.

They fist them? What?
Yeah, okay.

Let me just give you an example.
Like fist in the ass?

Here's a cat,
and here's this other cat.

Kk-kk, argh!

The guts. Think about that.

You're welcome.

I don't like cats.
Heh, me neither.

Whoa.
I know you ain't talking shit

about my statue.
Oh, this is a Mercury special?

Yeah, that's my lucky statue.
Oh.

This is Mercury.
This the god, Mercury.

You never read nothin'
about him in books?

Oh, no. I don't read.
Oh, you don't read?

Well, this nigga was that nigga

So my mama named me after
that nigga, so...

Hmm.

I really want
this one in Louisiana.

Um, there's one in Alabama,
Lord help me.

[SOUTHERN ACCENT] Alabama?
Yep.

[REGULAR VOICE] Hell, no.

I'm gonna go be a hillbilly.

And then something in Florida.
You're already a hillbilly.

You gonna be
an even bigger hillbilly?

Thanks. Don't judge a book
by its cover.

Yeah, so, I mean, we'll see.

Maybe I'll get in.
Maybe I fucking won't.

Maybe I'll save that...

Fifty thousand dollars' worth
of debt every year,

or whatever the fuck it is.

Did you go to college?

Fuck college. I can rap.

The fuck I need to go
to college for?

Yeah, for real,
'cause you're lucky.

You're one of the lucky ones.
You got talent.

You love what you do?

Yeah, it's cool.

It got its ups and downs

I like the money.

What if you couldn't do it

what would you do?

Couldn't do what anymore, rap?

You know, yeah,
make music, perform.

Sell crack. Duh.

No, I wanna, like,
help people somehow.

Help people do what?
I don't know,

get their shit together.

You know, some counseling.

Like...

I mean, there's so much...

Do you wanna start a rehab
or some shit?

Could do.

I mean, it helped me out,

changed my fucking life, so...

We can work together.

I sell crack,

Thank you. This is

You go in a motherfucker's crib

and just touch their shit.
I just seen it.

I don't believe
you still got this shit.

I really don't believe it.
You don't need to believe it.

Believe it,
I'm in your face, bitch.

Nobody worried about that.
Fuck you.

You going crazy here.
Fuck you, bald-headed bitch.

Get the fuck out.
What are you, hairy?

Come on, bro.
This place making you crazy.

What the fuck you doing here?
You ain't no mountain dude.

What's wrong with you?
PAUL: Hey.

Get out of here.
This driving you crazy.

You shouldn't
have brought that up.

Fuck that shit. Give me my hat.

Fuck you. Fuck you

MERCURY: Fuck you, nigga.

Fuck y'all.
MERCURY: Fuck you, bitch.

[MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY]

What?


My man...

This is great and all, like,
yo, tonight was... Was fun.

Ahem, but...

I'm like...


You tripping.
You had too much to drink.

No, hear me out. Hear me out.

You don't gotta worry about me.
I did...

Hey, I'm not gonna lie, man.

I'm coming out of my face right
now. On the real, though...

You're the star, right?
You're the main attraction.

You're the creative genius,
right?

I give you that respect,
you know what I'm saying?

But, yo,
I'm a facilitator, right?

That's what you pay me to do,
dude.

And I'm just trying to say,
bro, like...

We did... We built this.
We did this together.

You can't say
my contributions mean nothing.

Yeah, and you can't tell me
when I had enough.

Calm the fuck down, dawg.

My dude.

Damn, my nigga, get your head
out the clouds for a second.

Ten years from now,
you had enough,

you're gonna come out
with some new manager,

some new career,

on some retro
"Yo, I'm back" shit.

That's what
I'm worried about, bro.

I lose you now,
you quit the game now,

a decade, you need some cash,

you're back out
with some other motherfucker.

I put too much work in, bro.

Man, I'm Money Merc.
I am money, nigga. I'm good.

[SNIFFS, THEN EXHALES SHARPLY]

Let's get the show done, dude.
New York. Come on.

That's that shit.
Why you sound so thirsty, man?

'Cause I am, bro.
I mean, look, man.

You know I got five kids, dude.
Come on.

You know what that is.

New York City.

New York City.

That's when everybody
can come out.

The world can see you.
Let the world know.

New York City?
It's the one gig, bro.

Come out, blast that shit.

Rock that shit.
You know what I'm saying?

New York City?
Make people feel that shit.

New York City?
Yo, New York City.

New York City?
New York City, right?

Yeah.
New York City.

Well, that's exciting.
Yeah.

Bet you're happy
to be back on-stage.

Definitely happy
to get back on-stage.

Can't wait.
I'm gonna get my mojo back.

Give the people what they want.

Yeah.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

I just want that feeling back,
you know?

Once I get up there,
I'll feel it again, you know?

You should come with me.

This weekend, New York.

Go to the show, shop,
all of that.

You know what I mean?

You and me
in New York City, huh?

New York City.


Yeah?
That's nice. Um...

I got into grad school.
Oh, yeah?

Yeah.
Oh, shit, congrats.

Thanks.
That's what's up.

I'm going to Louisiana.

Yeah?

Um, ahem.
Louisiana?

Mm-hm.

I got a friend there
who's got a restaurant.

She's gonna hook me up
with a job and an apartment,

and I'm gonna go next week.

You're gonna leave here
to work at a restaurant

in dusty-ass Louisiana?

Yeah, make some money
before I start school.

You'll just be in debt
with grad school.

You said you didn't
wanna do this shit.

And fuck Louisiana.
That shit dirty.

Every time I tour and go
to New Orleans or Baton Rouge,

I hate that shit.
The food overrated.

Shit make
my fucking stomach hurt.


Shit. We're just going
to New York for the weekend.

[MICHAELE BREATHING HEAVILY]

BOB:
<i>It's pretty simple.</i>

And just latch it,
just like that.

Uh, my favorite is sardines.

Just reach in, put a can
of sardines back there.

Pretty much,
it'll catch anything,

but if this is a skunk...

you got some problems.

And, uh, whatever you do,

you find a skunk in here,
you call me, man.

Call me right away.
I'll come up.

Don't fuck with it. Don't even
think about fucking with it.

I'm gonna shoot
that motherfucker.

You shoot it,
you're gonna wear it

from your boots to your head
for two weeks,

all over your body, you won't
even... You have no idea.

Well, man. Good luck with that.

Yeah, fuck it.

You want me to drive you
or something?

No.

Listen, I got...
I gotta tell you, man.

I'm really sorry
about the other day

when I went nuts and blew up.
Uh...

I mean, you're not a farmer,
and for me to expect and ask

and react like that
for what you did,

I gotta say, I'm sorry, man.
All right, man. We good.

Let's cut the dick-sucking
contest. I'm good.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

Get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here.

I'll be back. You trap
