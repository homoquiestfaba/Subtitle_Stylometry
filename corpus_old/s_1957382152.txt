<i>(music continues)</i>

<i>How do you know when
you're in love, Goosie?</i>

<i>(scoffs)</i>

<i>You feel it,
dweeb. Your palms get sweaty.</i>

<i>You feel like
you're gonna hurl.</i>

<i>You can't stop staring.</i>

<i>(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)</i>

<i>(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)</i>

<i>It's happening.</i>

(fireworks whizzing)

(fireworks exploding)

(speakers humming)

<i>(guitar playing)</i>

<i>(record scratching effect)</i>

<i>(energetic music plays)</i>

<i>â™ª She's my polyrhythm â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Carryin' my
heart like a beat â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So fast I
can't keep up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My prayers sing melody â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Do do do-do,
hey â™ª</i>

<i>(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)</i>

<i>â™ª I'm so lonely... â™ª</i>

That's a cool windbreaker.
It's retro.

Hey, you still got that
crazy teacher again this year?

Woman
won't leave me alone.

Gotta love
homeschooling.

Yeah, I don't.

<i>â™ª I'm so lonely â™ª</i>

Thought you fixed it.

I did.
(hood slams)

And then you fixed it,
so I had to fix your fix.

You're my little brother.
What are little brother's for?

What's up, boys?
What's up, Donnie?

What's up, Mikey?
Whoa!

That your mom's jacket?
Ha-ha, hilarious.

It's retro,
bro. Great conversation starter.

First day of senior year,
I like it.

Kid's taking a swing.

I actually like that jacket.
It would look better on me.

I can't believe
you're my brother.

Why are we stopping?

Remember Zoey,
our cousin?

She bit you at
my birthday party,

and you peed
your pants. (chuckles)

That's what happens
when you're six and afraid.

Well, her parents got divorced
so she moved here.

All right,
switch me, dude.

I don't want to sit next to
that flesh eater, she's crazy.

Hey,
there she is.

(energetic music plays)

You know what?
We're good.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Thanks for the ride.

Walking is way
too athletic for me.

(smacks lips)

You're...

Hi.
You're Josh, right?

You bit me... I...
when we were kids.

Oh! Yeah, yeah.
You...

Well, in my defense,
I think you took the last piece

of cake or something.
<i>(rock music plays in earbuds)</i>

What are you listening to?

<i>(music continues)</i>

Is that Lovelytheband?

You like them?
Yeah.

Are you kidding me?
Lovelytheband is like...

soundtrack of our generation.

Oh, it's happening?

â™ª I dreamed that I lit
my house on fire â™ª

â™ª Sat in the road
and watched it burn â™ª

â™ª Wanting to see
some kind of hero â™ª

â™ª Jump in the
flames and rescue her â™ª

(girls laughing)

â™ª She was a
movie that was over â™ª

â™ª Credits were
rolling and down her face â™ª

â™ª We were a part
that's going nowhere â™ª

â™ª I was just
staring off into space â™ª

â™ª When I hear that song â™ª

â™ª Rattles my heart
like a storm in the jungle â™ª

â™ª Starting to rumble â™ª

â™ª I hear you sing along â™ª

â™ª Every part â™ª

â™ª And my
stone heart crumbles â™ª

â™ª I guess
'cause I love you so â™ª

â™ª I love you so â™ª

â™ª I love you so â™ª

â™ª I love you so â™ª

â™ª It's not that I want
to return to innocence â™ª

â™ª I want to lose
it all over again â™ª

â™ª Wish I could... â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

(feedback on loudspeaker)

(man on PA) <i>Attention,
students...</i>

Zoey!
Yep.

Hi.
<i>...all practices will be canceled.</i>

Do you... do you, um,
do you want, um,

do you have ChapStick?

You want to borrow
my ChapStick?

Yep.
(chuckles)

Yeah.

(bag unzipping)

You can keep it.

Thank you.

(school bell rings)

Nice,
what'd we score?

Ooh, Watermelon Sparkle.
Shut it!

Class is that way.

Yep, here.

<i>(music plays
on headphones)</i>

<i>â™ª ...be by your side â™ª</i>


<i>(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)</i>

(music stops)

That was awesome.

Why have I
never heard this before?

Come on.
"Zoey's special mix."

Really?
No one is supposed to hear that.

That's... that's your new plan?
A mix?

You don't understand because
you don't believe in love.

Ah, I forgot.
I can't feel human emotion.

How do you
know you're in love?

You feel it,
dweeb.

Did you call me a dweeb?

Look, you're never,
ever gonna get anywhere

unless you tell
her how you feel.

What are you so afraid of?

Nothing, man.
It's just...

(man on PA) <i>Joshua Torres,
please report</i>

<i>to Mr. Elmer's
office immediately.</i>

Oh, don't worry, man.
Elmer loves me.

I hate you.

Thank you?

Do you have
something for me?

I... have a protein bar
in my locker, yes.

I mean your final essay,
smartass.

You're the only one
who's missing from this stack.

And now I'm late for a
backgammon tournament.

And from what I hear,
it's, um,

like how you say,
"turned"?

Okay, look, Mr. Elmer, I just
need a little bit more time,

you know,
but you're gonna love it.

I got these beautiful
chapters and illustrations.

It's looking pretty nice.

I don't need
"Lord of the Rings."

I just need ten pages
answering the question,

"How was your
high school experience?"

Yes, I just need
some more time.

Time?
High school's over.

I mean, it's not over over.
We still have three more weeks.

It's over.
Is it, though?

It is.

Yeah, but a lot of interesting
things can happen

in the next three weeks.

I'm talking
life-changing events

that can completely change
my whole high school experience.

Okay, have you seen
"Fireworks at Beaumont"

with Patrick J. Michaels?

Uh, uh...

It's a classic '80s movie.
He spends all of senior

trying to get
with the prettiest girl

and it's not until the
very last day of school

that... that there's
this beautiful concert.

And he grabs the guitar,
and then boom, it happens.

And she falls in
love with him at the end.

It happens.
It will happen.

(thunder rumbling)

I can't describe my
high school experience yet

because it's not over.

It can't be.

Okay.

Get me the
essay by Sunday.

Sunday,
that's in a few days.

Yeah, that's me
giving you a break, okay?

If you don't turn it in,
you're not gonna graduate.

And your real high
school experience will be spent

in summer school with me.

That's not a
fun essay to write.

(thunder rumbling)

I can't write
your paper, man.

I gotta spend my
weekend looking for food trucks.

What?

Yeah, Donnie wants to get
into the grilled cheese business

before graduation.

So, you know, I don't know much,
but I do know this...

chicks don't dig
cheese. It's a fungus.

(cell phone ringing)
Just tell Donnie how you feel.

No!

yeah, I'm outside.

No,
I'm not gonna walk to Starbucks.

Because it's raining!

I will see
you here. Thanks.

Hi.
What's up, cuz?

Hi. Oh, oh,
did you hear?

The closing act at
Front and Center this year

will be Lovelytheband.

No way.
Yeah, they just announced it.

My friend Liz
went last year.

She said it
was like totally lit.

I would kill
for wristbands,

but they sold out in
like two minutes, it's insane.

(phone chimes) Oh, wait.

(intense music)

(man vocalizing)

(music continues)

Okay, gotta go.
Uh, I'm coming, Kale.

My chaturanga
was unbelievable.

Oh, as always.

Kale.
Can't be his real name.

It's short for Kaleb, I think.

What does she even see
in the guy?

Are you kidding?

What's up, Cam?
(girl) Hey, Kale.

His name could be Catheter
and she'd still wanna date him.

Semantics, Michael.

Look, he'll be out of
the picture in no time.

I have a plan.
Oh, there's a shocker.

An insanely
great plan, bro.

I literally have no plan.

About Zoey?

No,
about Mr. Elmer.

I mean, how am I supposed to
write an essay in one weekend?

It's unfair.
Dude, seriously?

No, I'm 100% Team Elmer here.
Why don't you just finish it?

Well...
We're late for work.

You've been on it
for a year now.

You really need
to pull the trigger.

It's hard to get
her attention.

Her? Aren't we still
talking about Elmer?

No,
we're talking about Zoey.

Well, I don't know.
Here's a crazy idea.

Maybe you just walk
up to her in a heartfelt way,

say "I like you.
Do you like me?"

(popcorn kernels dropping)

"I like you, you like me?"
Really?

I can't say that.
She has a boyfriend.

(jazz music)

says, this still holds up.

(Josh) Oh, totally.
How many times do you think

we've seen this
movie since we were kids?

Probably like a million.

Okay, so would
Patrick J. Michaels

be afraid of his crush,
having a girlfriend?

No, no, he'd plant
his flag in the ground

and take a
beating in the name of love.


Aren't you
supposed to be working?

Go back to sleep,
Jared!


Mm,
mm-mm.

This part always
makes me nervous.

<i>I love you, Brittany.
I always have.</i>

<i>And I always will.
(fireworks whizzing)</i>

<i>â™ª We only have tonight
my, my, my love... â™ª</i>


The music,
the fireworks, I mean, that...

that is how a first
kiss is supposed to be.

Mm-hmm.
(sighs)

I so doubt she
was homeschooled.


Dude, come on.

One of us at
least has got to have

our
fireworks-on-the-dock moment.

You're right.

I need to be more like
Patrick J. freakin' Michaels.

Yes, you do.
Okay, I could play her

that mix that
I've been working on.

Oh, that's such a good idea.
Yeah.

I mean, high school's
almost over.

It's now or never,
Goosie.

(jazz music)

(boy on TV)
<i>It's Friday-Bye-Day,</i>

<i>and I'm very curious
what Zoey has to say.</i>

<i>Um, well, actually,
today's lunch would be</i>

<i>a literal
Friday-Bye-Day for me because..</i>

<i>(sighs)...
I am graduating early</i>

<i>and moving to Los Angeles.</i>

<i>For reals?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

(bell dings)

(intense music)

â™ª You make me so,
so sad â™ª

â™ª I'm talking waterfall â™ª

â™ª You make me so, so sad... â™ª
(record scratching effect)

Josh?
Josh?

L.A.! Can you believe it?

I really can't.
How about you, Josh?

Um,
when are you moving out?

Uh, I don't know.
Two or three...

Weeks?
Days, actually.

Yeah, I know, it all
happened like really fast.

Kale got a job
at an art gallery...

Well,
he's going too?

Yeah, yeah,
we are moving in together.

We'll see how that goes.

Wow, and Aunt Marie
is cool with that?

Uh, no, no,
not at all.

Phenomenal instincts,
that woman.

Well, it's not really
up to her, I'm 18.

If she can live with
her annoying boyfriend,

I can live with mine,
too.

Not that Kale is
annoying or anything.

Besides, maybe this is
like a good opportunity for me

to like further develop my art,
you know?

Your art?
What, what art?

I think it's a
bold move, cuz.

Thank you.
Okay.

Zoey, how do you know
you're not making a mistake?

Well, how do I know that I'm
not making the right decision?

'Cause it's a mistake!
(school bell rings)

Wow, you would really
get along well with my mom.

Zoey. Come on.

Hey. Uh, I'll see
you later, guys.

I'll miss you.

That was good.
I like that.

Especially the
part where you tell her

that her dreams and
aspirations are a mistake.

Freakin' British people,

dude,
with their accents.

It's like their
superpower or something.

It's un... it's unfair.

Well...

(mimics British accent)
...there's not much to say.


That's my in-between-the-knees
pillow, and I sleep in the nude.

What is wrong with you?

Nothing.
You should try it.

It's insanely breezy.

It's that redcoat Kale,
man.

He's a bad influence on her,
I'm telling you.

He's an artist, so now
she wants to be an artist?

Zoey's been into art
since she was a kid.

What is this?

Texas A&M?

The housing department?
You're leaving me, too?

No,
I'm not.

I just wanted optics,
but it's out of state, man.

I can't afford it.

And I can't just
move across the country

and abandon my brother.

It's been the
two of us for...

forever and...

(horn honking "La
Cucaracha" outside)

(tires screeching,
brakes whining)

You gotta be kidding me.

Check it out,
boys!

Don't say anything
about A&M.

Donnie, buddy!

Thought you
were gonna wait for me.

Yeah, well,
there was another buyer

and,
you know, had to take it.

There was another buyer
for this.

Uh-huh, yeah, no.
She needs work.

But trust me,
she's a gem.

Uh... you can fix that,
right?

So I'm
thinking about names.

The
Milleni-Yum Falcon. Y-U-M.

(snickers)
Right? Mm.

You can be Chewie.

I don't
want to be Chewie.

All right, I'm gonna let
you guys figure it out.

I gotta get to work.

Why wouldn't you
want to be Chewie?

Why wouldn't <i>you</i> want
to be Chewie?

'Cause I'm
the roguish one.

Maybe Mikey's right.

Maybe I
should just move on.

What? Heck no!

If you let this damsel that
you've been distressing over

leave before you have a chance
to profess your true feelings,

then, then you will
wind up a shell of man

forever haunted by
the cruel ghost of "what if."

But she's
leaving in two days.

(man on radio) <i>Who wants
wristbands to see Lovelytheband</i>

<i>at Front and Center?</i>

<i>That's right, Big Joe Henry
here giving away two wristbands</i>

<i>to the first caller.</i>

<i>So call now.</i>
Call!

Faster! Buttons,
push them!

<i>And we have a winner.</i>
Ahhh...

<i>Congrats to Matt Baker.</i>
Ohh!

<i>Cancel whatever you're doing
this weekend, Matt,</i>

<i>because you're
going to Front and Center.</i>

Baker!
Ugh!

Man,
Lovelytheband, front and center?

That would've
been a date to remember.

I mean, the romance
would have been off the charts.

Gah! It sucks for you.

(popcorn popping)

(fireworks exploding)

Hello?
Hey, dude, um...

my... my boss's
son has food poisoning,

something
about discount sushi.

Cool. Why don't you grab
a pen and the paper

and add that to the list
of things I don't care about?

He had three tickets
to Front and Center

and he gave them to me.
What?

Get out.
Yes, yes.

And if we leave by tonight,
we can make it

to Lovely by Sunday night,
we just need some wheels, bro.

Yeah, leave that to me.
Sweet.

And you just gotta help me
convince Zoey to come with us.

Dude,
no! Why? Why?

Price of admission.
Meet me in an hour.

You're the worst.

This is good.
This is really good.

Dude, that wasn't even
like a white lie,

that was like a
full-on Lance Armstrong.

This is bad.

Oh crap,
this is really bad.

I'm gonna cancel this
whole thing, what've done?

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no, no, you can't do that.

Look, you set into
motion something big, okay?

Zoey's not gonna
say no to Lovelytheband,

and plus,
it's a road trip.

With friends,
just like in the movies.

When are we leaving?

We?

(cell phone vibrating)

Babe, do you think we should
exhibit this at the gallery,

or do you think
we should save it

for, like,
above our bed?

Babe?

Have you
seen my sketchbook?

What is your jacket
doing on my sketchbook?

I like to take a peek
once in a while

and give some advice,
that's all.

But you know that I don't like
to show my stuff

when it's not ready.
I know you feel threatened

when you're
surrounded by real art.

But you can get to this level,
too, babe.

It just takes
time. I mean, look.

That piece there
took me nine years.

That one stripe
there took me a solid month.

Okay, can you just get over
yourself for a hot second?

I am sensing something
very awry in your aura.

Yes. Yes, my aura
is very awry.

We're not even close to
being ready to leave tomorrow.

And I don't know,
is the move too soon?

And, and maybe I should like,
look into local art programs

or something...
Ooh!

Artists don't need uni.

You don't learn art,
you...

(sighs) You live it.
You live it.

Look, do you think they could've
taught me that in school?

Hell to the no.

I was eating Frosted
Flakes one morning and then,

boom,
it hit me.

The Cereal
Killers collection.

Bedroom.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(loud groan)

Okay...

Let's go!
(whispers) Shh!

You're gonna
wake up your parents!

Oh, don't worry about them.

They're in Colombia
attending a symposium

on the
neuroscience of perception.

Then why
did you sneak out?

Oh, 'cause I've always
wanted to do that.

Why are we whispering?
I don't know.

But I kind of like it now.

Oh, you are totally
not going to regret

me coming along.

Little known fact,
I'm an amazing wingman.

Woman. Wing woman.

(horn honking
"La Cucaracha")

What?
No way, for real?

The Milleni-Yum Falcon
at your service.

Dude, Donnie
let you take this?

Yeah! Yeah, I just left him
a nice little note

explaining
everything and we're cool.

Whoa, we're going
in this thing?

Mm-hmm.
Consider tone set.

Hi, Molly.
Hey.

I thought you only
had three wristbands.

Oh, I bought my own.
Yeah, months ago.

Dig me some Lovelytheband,
am I right?

Yeah, yeah. There's
nothing weird about that, so...

And I'm going to be documenting
the whole experience.

(camera clicking)

Hey, did you get
a hold of Zoey?

Yeah, man, she's on
her way right now.

She's gonna
confess her love for y...

No,
I haven't talked to her.

She was at Kale's
22 minutes ago.

You guys have
heard of social media, right?

It's a thing, yeah?

Good job, Molls.
All right, let's roll!

(metal scraping)
Gotcha!


And we're screwed.

"I borrowed the truck,

BRB next week."

How is next week "BRB"?

That was the nice note
you left him?

Mikey,
we're supposed to be

working on the
truck all weekend.

Yeah, but Josh got wristbands
to Front and Center.

What?

Donnie, I'm sorry, bro,
we only have three wristbands.

I don't even think
Zoey's coming.

Donnie can just
use her wristband.

We haven't even
talked to her, man.

Semantics, Michael.

Okay, the semantics are
she's not going.

You're not going, you...
you're definitely not going.

No one's going in my
truck. Get out! Out, now!

I have an
extra wristband.

(bell dings)

Yep, yes,
I bought two

and I could sell
Donnie the extra wristband.

And who are you?

Oh, I'm sorry,
where are my manners?

My name's
Molly. Molly Jenkins.

Some would say a
wingman extraordinaire.

Woman. Woman.
Yeah, I got it, Molly Jenkins.

So how much
for the wristband?

How about
a Falcon ride's worth?

You know what's great
about Front and Center?

The music, but that's not
what you're going to say.

The food trucks, Mikey.
Food trucks

as far as the eye
can see. I'm in, I'm in.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

All right.
See, I told you,

I'm an amazing wingwoman.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(engine sputtering)

(tires screeching)

wait, my bike!

We've been packing
for eight hours,

This is the perfect recipe
for a small mental breakdown.

Okay, well, maybe if
you would've helped me packed

instead of talking about
your stupid painting all night,

I would be less stressed.

Take that back.


I will not let this
portal of negativity

enter my new LA flat.

It's called
an apartment, Kale.

(mock British accent)
We are not in London.

If I wanna be cultured
and call it a flat,

I will call it a
flat because it's flat!

You need to take a savasana,
work on your energy.

(cell phone ringing)

What!

What?


Let's go! (music playing)

Zoey, come on!
Come on, let's go!

â™ª Yeah, baby, I'll be there
Yeah, baby, I'll be there â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

We'll be
back in a few days.

But we committed
to hot springing

on the way to L.A.

Well, apparently I need
to work on my energy, so...

See you Monday.

Do schedules mean
nothing to you?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Wow! Man,
you finally got it!

This looks like a...
Garbage can with paint.

Yeah, yeah, it does.

Hey, I can't believe you
got wristbands for this thing.

I know, trust me,
I can't believe it either.

That's crazy.
Yeah.

Insane, right?

Hi, I'm Zoey.
I know.

I mean, I don't. I don't know,
because we've never met

and I've never
heard anything about you.

All right, guys ready?
Let's go.

All right.

(overlapping cheering)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(music stops, metal creaking)

(creaking continues)

Uh, thank you
for inviting me.

You know, I'm like
obsessed with Lovelytheband.

Oh, I know.

I've seen the
inside of your locker.

In passing.

(sighs, phone pings)

(phone swooshes)


(overlapping swooshes and beeps)

You know I can just switch
places with Molly if you want.

No, no, no, no, it's...
No! No!

No, I'm, um,
there's these puppies.

What's that?

Uh,
it's a sketchbook.

Cool,
what're you doing?

Sketching.

Um,
would you want to see?

Yeah,
is that cool?

Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, cool.

This is amazing.

Like professional level amazing.

I had no clue
you were so talented.

I mean, what on earth...
(both laughing)

Oh, no, that's like,
that's a work in progress.

I don't normally show
people my stuff,

but if everyone reacts like you

then maybe I
have a shot in L.A., huh?

I mean, I think you
have a shot anywhere.

Doesn't have to be L.A.

You know,
the local college has

a pretty good art program.
No, no, no, no.

You don't learn art,
you live it.

I mean, unless you're
Caravaggio or Da Vinci,

or any of the other
masters who've pretty much spent

their lives studying,
like, right out of the womb.

Or not.

You know, I'm not
doing it for him, right?

The whole move for Kale, it's
not like a chasing a guy thing.

That's not what this is about.

I didn't say you were.

I want to
become an artist.

I think you're
already an artist.

That's
really sweet of you.

(phone swooshes)

Really, I'd be fine if we switched places.
No! No, no, no.

It's totally cool with me.
Just, um...

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

high school experience?

"Well, to be honest, I haven't
had many worth writing about.

But like I said,
high school isn't over yet."

planning on eating anytime soon?

hangry. Pull over, dude.

Literally anywhere.

(barkers shouting)

Here you go.

Carnival food
for breakfast, great.

Corn dogs are
breakfast food.

It's like
pancakes and sausage.

Hey, hey, hey,
okay, so,

I found a guy
with wristbands.

What? Molls,
you're incredible.

Are you serious?

You're welcome.
Yeah.

So, where do we
meet this guy of yours?

The Motel Mermaid.

You know,
it's close to the festival.

I think we'd be
idiots if we didn't stay there.

Looks cheap. I'm in.

Hey, Molly, you want to like,
hit the ring toss or something?

Scope out the carnies?
Love me some carnie scoping.

All right.

Now, see, that is why I
never joined varsity anything.

Although there was
like a hot second when I was

on the cheer squad
'cause of the cute outfits.


Uh, so,
home school? What's that like?

Uh, it's rigorous work, yeah.

Wake up at 4:00
a.m. every morning,

and I milk the cows,

I churn the butter,
et cetera, et cetera.

Okay. So, so, so what're you
gonna do after high school?

You gonna like,
reject the system,

build a community garden,
all that?

Yeah, no, totally.
Yeah, I mean,

the parents might
not be for that idea.

But me? Phew. (laughs)

No, actually I'm probably just
gonna go to the local college,

my dad teaches there,
and major in psychology.

Wow, that's actually
really cool.

You are full of surprises.

I am. Watch this.

(bottles clinking)

Did any of those land?

No...
None whatsoever...

(overlapping chatter, laughter)

We suck at this.
We do.

Although, we're doing
much better than they are.


They need some help.
Okay, so are you related

to them on their
mom's side or their dad's side?

Uh, Mom's, thank god.

Dad was a creeper.
I heard.

Did he really run
off with that woman

right after the
mom passed away?

I mean, that's,
that's messed up.

Yeah, no, he did.

How did you
know about that?

Oh,
I heard it from Josh.

Oh yeah, Josh and I,
we tell each other everything.

Sometimes he tells me too much,
quite frankly, you know?

Darts?
Darts.

(bell dings)

Did she see?

Yeah, man, she just
canceled the move.

All right, let me take
a whack at it.

And after this, we
gotta hit the road, that wa...

(truck pulling away)

Ohh...

Mikey,
we gotta get LEDs, man,

it'll look like we're
jumping into hyper drive...

Guys?

If he could marry that
food truck, he would.

Bro, at some point,
you're gonna have to tell him

how you feel.
Oh, yeah, sure.

Soon as you tell Zoey
how you feel, I'll tell Donnie.

Everyone that's been
passing through here

has been wanting this prize,
and you could have it for free

if you ride the
Ferris wheel with me.

Oh, hey.

Hey, Zoey, can I
give it a shot?

Oh, I didn't know
the lady was spoken for.

Oh, no.
Oh, we're not...

Hey there, mister, you know
what'd be great?

Is getting this
man some darts.

Three tries.
Okay.

That was terrible.
It was my first try.

Excuse you.
Excuse me? Uh...

You, uh, you ain't from
around here, are you?

Yeah, we can
show you around.

Uh,
no thank you.

Some of our friends
are throwing a party tonight.

Look, I'm not
interested, okay?

Thank you.
Have a nice day.

Hey, bro, she said
she's not interes...

...ted.

What I'm trying to sa...

Oh yeah, I don't think this
is the hill you wanna die on.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

There are no rules
in a street fight.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Street fight people rules!

â™ª Give me, give me that
sunshine, sunshine â™ª

â™ª Give me, give me
them good times, good times â™ª

â™ª Give me, give me
that sunshine, sunshine â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Every day is
a new beginning â™ª

â™ª Every day is a
gift to hold up high â™ª

â™ª Don't worry
'bout the clouds â™ª

â™ª 'Cause when
the skies come out â™ª

â™ª Give me, give me
that sunshine, sunshine â™ª

â™ª Give me, give me
them good times, good times â™ª

â™ª Bring on
the summertime â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Bring on
the summertime â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(horn honking
"La Cucaracha")

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Bring on the
summertime â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

(laughing)
That was insane!

Josh, you were like,
so ready for business,

and Molly,
you were so cool, I hate it!

It was like I was outside of
my body watching myself do that.

You can
spot me any time.

So sick!

I can't remember the last
time I've had that much fun.

Yeah, me... me neither.
I... I can't remember.

(giggling)
So cool!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª There's a river,
there's a river â™ª

â™ª Could've taken us home â™ª

â™ª But you lost,
but you lost me â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Hey!
(camera clicks)

â™ª There's a fire in
my chest burning my soul â™ª

â™ª But it fights
with my heartbeat â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Ooh... â™ª

â™ª Ooh... â™ª

â™ª There's a
schoolboy standing up â™ª

â™ª In front of an army â™ª

â™ª Shoes in the
mud and the wet paint â™ª

â™ª Twists and turns â™ª

â™ª Up the alley,
just like it should â™ª

â™ª So your colors â™ª

â™ª They starve â™ª

â™ª Ooh... â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Ooh... â™ª

Hey, guys,
we're here.

(distant music, chatter)

You hear that?
What's going on?

Where's that coming from?
It's pretty loud.

Doesn't sound like
it's coming from our rooms.

Everywhere, the sound
is everywhere.

Hey, guys.

(music playing)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Let's glow up and join
the party people.

(scoffs)
No, no, no, no, no.

We're not having a
"Princess Diaries" moment.

Yes, yes, we are.
Come on, we got time.

You're gonna look great.
I... the boys

haven't even
started getting ready yet.

Hey, girls, you ready?

Is that my jacket?
It looks better on me.

(knocks)
Hey, girls.

(Zoey) No!
(Molly) Go away!

â™ª Don't let it
stop you now â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Don't let it
stop you now â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Sweet wheels.

Oh, man, is it a
22500 cranking watts Genny?

Ahh, this baby here
pumps up 2,200 CFM.

She's a beast.
Heck yeah, she is.

Name's Luca.
Wanna come inside?

Donnie.
And yes, I do.

(distant music)


(chuckling)
You good?

Yeah, yeah.

(cell phone ringing)

I can see why you want
to be a psychologist one day.

You pick up on everything,
don't you?

Ah, s...

Yes, yes,
I do.

I mean, I've just always
been fascinated with behavior,

and people say that I have like
this skill to read people, so...

That does
not surprise me.

All right, come on,
Young Freud, read me.

Uh, no.
No, no, no, no...

What?
'Cause people

usually get
offended when I do it.

For example,
I read my Aunt Belle once,

and it kind of
ruined Thanksgiving.

She threw a 40 at me.

She totally missed,
by the way.

But it was after I
told her that alcohol

was negatively
affecting her life, so whatever.

Oh now, come on,
now you gotta read me.

Psychoanalyze me until I cry.

(nervous chuckles)
Okay. But, um...

Don't say I... I
didn't warn you.

Okay.


You market yourself like
this extroverted dream girl,

but deep down,
you're sick of it,

the people calling
you beautiful because

you know they're just
talking about the surface and...

Like every girl ever, there's
so much more to you than that.

But you don't advertise your
real talents, like your art.

And maybe it's because it's
on a brand or you're afraid that

people won't like your work,
which will leave you feeling unappreciated.

So instead, you fill that void
with superficial relationships

with older,
seemingly self-assured guys.

And you know
this isn't healthy,

but you tell yourself
it's whatever, because

at the end of the day, you're
aware that you're doing it.

But soon, you're
gonna find yourself stuck living

under the cloud of
someone else's dream,

convincing yourself to do things
that you never wanted to do

in the first place,
like move in with Kale.

Or not. Sorry, uh...

Half the time, I don't
know what I'm talking about.

It's a good thing
I don't have a 40.

(nervous chuckle)

Okay...

All right,
you gotta give me something.

Preferably a long
list of your screw-ups

so I don't feel
bad about myself.

Well, I don't have much
in terms of dating.

Uh, and by not much,
I mean, like nonexistent.

I've never
even kissed a guy.

Oh, shut up.

What? Why? Why?

Uh, I just...

Okay, I... I think
a first kiss should...

should be kind of a big deal.
Okay

And I want the whole shebang,
you know?

Like,
like I want a romantic setting,

underneath the stars,
and a twinkle in my eye

that signals that
we're supposed to kiss and...

and then
magical fireworks explode.

Is that all?
Yeah.

Okay, well, now
it's my turn to read you.

You overthink things.
With the right guy,

it's not like, about all
the fireworks and stuff.

Um, turn.

But you and Josh,
you guys seem super close.

(laughing)
What?

No, no, no.
What?

Not that there's
anything wrong with Josh,

because he, he is great.

And, you know,
now that I think about it,

he's kind of cute,
right?

And I mean, ooh, you
should see him at matinee time.

Woof. Can't keep
those geriatrics off of him,

if you know
what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, Josh is sweet.
Yeah.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Where did you find this place?
Did you know this was happening?

I did not.
(cell phone beeps)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

There you guys are.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Oh, hey, okay,
so, wristband...

What?

Uh,
nothing.

It's too much, right?
Like this, this hair thing,

and the sparkles...
No, no, it's...

It's nice.

Um, the wristbands.
Yes, all right.

So he is going to
text me when he gets here.

I think you should
give me the money now

that way you can just like,
focus.

Yeah. These are my savings.
Where'd you meet this guy?

Oh, Craigslist.
Craigslist?

What're we waiting for?
Let's go party!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(laughter, cheering
and whooping throughout)

(indistinct shouting)

Mikey, Mikey, I found
my tribe, I found 'em.

Whoa, Alcoholics Anonymous.
Maybe chill out on the drinks

'cause I can smell
you from like a mile away.


This is my baby brother.

I took care of him,
and now he's taking care of me.

I love you.
I love you, too.

Oh, guys, something
pretty awesome happened.

We are now members,

boom,
of the FTG.

What's, what's
the Food Truck Guild?

Uh, the greatest thing
in the world

if you drive a food truck,
yeah.

Luca hooked it up,
we're basically <i>familia</i> now.

We're in.

Y... you paid
money for this?

Uh, yeah,
you bet I did.

It's gonna
pay off in spades.

We're celebrating.
It's a celebration.

Celebration!

Hey.
Hey!

I'm Donnie.

I'm screwed.

Hey, Zoey,
uh...

you made it!

Oh my God, hey!
Liz, how are you?

I'm with Hunter
and Nick, say hi!

Uh,
hold on, I'll be back.

Hey,
hey.

She's not here with them,
she's here with you.

And I have some
inside information for you.

ignoring Kale's calls.

Really?
Uh-huh.

You're in the game,
buddy. You're in the game.

Yes, okay.

I just gotta get
her attention somehow.

You girls down, huh?
You wanna?

No.
Have a good night.

All right, yep,
you too.

Read the room,
man.

Not everyone is as passionate
about food trucks as you are.

Are you not passionate about the food
truck? Is that what you're saying?

No, no, that's not
what I'm saying.

It sounded like that's
what you're saying.

Do you hear yourself
when you talk?

"Hey, let me show you my
truck out in the parking lot."

That sounds like
you might abduct them.

Yeah, no,
I see that.

The night's still young,
there's plenty of girls.

Uh,
no more food trucks.

No more food trucks,
perfect.

No more food trucks,
no more food trucks.

Just talk to them about,
uh, science and culture...

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

there and ask her to dance.

People still like to dance,
right?

People love that stuff.

Okay.
Mm-hmm.

DJ Soap Suds for life!

(crowd shouting)

(speaker feedback)

(thud, all gasping)

didn't you catch him?

party's over.

Molls, you like
my mixes, right?

What is wrong with you?
Somebody just f...

Ohh! Yeah,
that's a good i...

He's walking. It's fine,
let's go.

I have a DJ!

This is a bad idea.
No, no, no,

you can figure it out.
He said it's pre-recorded,

these are all
just backtracks.

I do not know what that means.
These are just fragments

pre-recorded to
play while he runs his set.

Look,
that's even better.

No, no, the opposite
of better, no bueno.

Look, this is gonna take
me forever to mute or sync.

I can't do this.


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


Hey, okay, you remember that
cruel ghost of what-if?

Now is your chance.

<i>Esteemed guests
of the Motel Mermaid...</i>

(microphone feedback)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

<i>It is my honor
to introduce to you,</i>

<i>fresh off of
his European tour,</i>

<i>straight out of Berlin,
the man, the legend, DJ...</i>

Obie D-2.

<i>DJ Obie D-2! Whoo!</i>

(microphone feedback)

(chatter continues)

(high-pitched feedback)
Ahh!


(sound warping)

(rooster crowing effect)

(overlapping sound effects)

(crowd jeering)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(man 2) What're you doin'?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)


â™ª Sometimes,
but I don't always â™ª

â™ª 'Cause if I call â™ª

(music intensifies)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª What am I looking for? â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Come on!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª What am
I looking for? â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª What am I looking for? â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

That was amazing.
Insane, right?

Thank you for
having my back.

I knew you had it in you.

Dude, oh my gosh!
That was so sick.

I had no idea
you were that talented.

I... it's
a work in progress.

Oh, wow.

Uh,
you thirsty?

Yeah, sure,
come on.

You okay?
I'm fine.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Another one?
Yep.

Sorry.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

It was this
100-piece art set.

It was like, a pretty souped
up gift for ten-year-old me.

You know the ones
that fold open like suitcases?

Art was never really
my thing.

My drawings tended to
look like Rorschach tests.

What's a Rorschach
test?

You know, like,
the ink blot thing.

Like in the interrogation
scene of "Teen Genius."

Not an '80s movie fan?

No, I mean,
I kind of am, yeah...

Favorite PJM movie?
Who?

Patrick J. Michaels?

No? No?
No...

It's okay, he's not important.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.


(Zoey laughing)

Dude!

DJ Obie-D2? What is that?

Where did that come from?

You know how you don't like
to show anyone your art?

Well,
I'm must say,

I'm very glad that
you finally shared it.

You were great.

Like professional level amazing.

Think I got a shot in L.A.?

Yes, totally.

Now go take
my place with Kale.

(both chuckling)

Hey, can I play you something?

Something special?

It's a DJ
Obie-D2 original.

Yeah.

Yeah?
Yeah.

(music and chatter)

(clears throat)

You're a good dancer.

Sorry, I didn't mean to like,
scare you or anything,

I just saw you out on the dance
floor and I wanted to, like,

come over and say hi.

I'm Sebastian.

(stammering)
Uh...

I'm... I'm,
I'm Molly. Mol... Molly Jenkins.

And don't you forget it.

It would be hard to.

(both chuckling)

Where you from,
Molly Jenkins?

Oh, well, I mean,
I could tell you,

but like,
do you honestly care?

You have a funny way
of flirting, Molly Jenkins.

(laughing)
What? Do I?

Flir... flirt? I... no,
no,

I... I do not flirt,
sir.

I, um,
I... whew! It is...

It is warm out here.

Almost... hot... hot,
not like hot, like like "hot."

Like, just... I'm
sorry. It's like, above

the preferred body
temperature in this place.

I tell you what,
why don't, um, I don't know,

we go hang out
with some of my friends?

They're just like hanging out,
listening to music,

and, uh,
there's air conditioning.

Uh...

Yeah. Yeah, sure,
why not?

Let's go.
Okay, cool.

What are you doing?
You broke my heart.

You betrayed me,
Fredo!

Okay,
we've reached the

"acting out scenes
from the movies" drunk.

his name was Mikey.

Wait...

Okay,
is it your goal for the night

to scare every
single girl away?

We dreamt
the food truck.

That was our dream,
Mikey!

What are you talking about?
You! You!

You're thinking you're so smart
all the time and you're not.

You know what you are?

What?
Stupid.

Oh, I'm stupid?
Oh, sick burn.

You know what's stupid?
The Milleni-Yum Falcon.

That's a stupid name.


<i>(phone playing music)</i>

<i>â™ª But I don't
wanna say good night â™ª</i>

That was beautiful.

You made that for me?

When?

I've been working on it
for a few, uh...

Weeks?

Since I first met you.

You know, I've been
waiting for the right setting.

The lights, the hotel.

The diving board.

She's right, you know.

You are pretty cute.

You're pretty cute, as well.

Sorry it's taken me so
long to play this for you.

No, I mean, it probably explains
why we've never hooked up.

There's actually
been something

I've been
meaning to tell you.


Really? Really, guys?
Donnie! Donnie!

(overlapping screaming)

(screaming continues)

(slurring words)
When I grow up, I'm gonna be,

I'm gonna be like Luca.
Yup!

I... I don't know what
they're doing.

(both laughing)

Um...

So, uh, about earlier...

we need your help.

Ugh, looks like
they need you in there.

Good night.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Mmm...

â™ª I met a girl â™ª

â™ª Without a
care in the world â™ª

â™ª Her name was Molly â™ª

â™ª Big M, little Olly â™ª

â™ª She was holly, jolly... â™ª

(phone dings)

Oh.

Um, I,
I...

I have to go,
apologies on the abrupt exit.

So just, you have...
you have a good night.

You all have a good...
good night, and have you...

have you...
one... great...

(guitar player) Namaste,
Sebastian.

Hey, we can like,
go somewhere else if you like.

Oh, no, no, no,
it's not that at all.

I mean, it's very,
very melodic in there.

It's just I really
have to meet someone...

You have to meet
someone at midnight?

Yep.

Then I'll tell you what,
I'll go with you.

For your safety,
definitely not 'cause

I'm worried I'm not
gonna see you again.


an experience worth the wait.

"Just like in the movies.

"It's happening.

Just call me Josh,
or J. Michaels from now on."

Who are we
looking for again?

Uh, his name
is Dr. SpaceCakes.

Oh...

That's our guy.

you got the money?

You mean the wristbands?
How old are you?

Here you are, sir.

(sirens wailing)

Hands where I can see 'em!
They're offering me drugs!

you two just stay right there...

Should we... run?

That's a bad idea.

(birds chirping)

(cell phone ringing)

(phone swooshing)

(knocking on door)

Okay, relax, Josh,
I'm coming.

Hello, babe.
I've called you nonstop.

Did, uh,
did your phone break?

I, um...

the service is like super shoddy here.

Well,
what are you doing here?

Well, I saw you
on Liz's Snap,

so I dialed her up,
grabbed the first

puddle jumper I could find,
and wham, voilÃ , here I am.

Here you are.

Look, I'm sorry
about the other day.

I... I let my
chakras red line.

Please, forgive me.

Come on.


And we're back.

You know you're
the paint to my brush.

Okay, you just gotta stop
saying things like that.

No, I'm sorry,
I'm an artist.

I just think in pictures,
all right?

I'm like a
turtle in a race car.

Never mind, I come
bearing gifts of great news.

Got a little hook
up from my compadre.

Hey.
VIP wristbands

to Front and Center.
Look at that.

And that's
not even the best part.

Right now,
all your earthly possessions

are boxed up on a little
freight train to Los Angeles.

I'm sorry, my possessions
are on a train to where?

Home, babe.

They're on their way
home to the City of Angels.

Hey, have you seen...

Kale? Um...

W... when did you get here?

Uh, just now, Joshypoo,
and yes,

delighted to see you,
as well.

Um, where's Molly?
I don't know,

she's probably still
with that guy from last night.

What?
Oh, it's okay.

Calm down, I... I'm
sure she'll be back soon.

Why didn't you tell me
she didn't come back?

We need to find her.

Okay.

Intense
little bloke, no?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Whoa, Kale.

Was not expecting that.
Why is everybody

so surprised to see me?

You do realize that
Zoey is my girlfriend, right?

That would imply
that we hang out a lot.

Just didn't know that you
were coming here, that's all.

Yeah, well, maybe if
you'd answer my calls.

Okay.
Molly's missing.

Missing what?

She didn't get
to her room last night.

Okay, we need to split up
and start knocking on doors.

Yeah, you, uh, you wanna
check the parking lot

and I'll check the...

Great, we're still in
the silent treatment, good.

I forgot we were eight.

Do we make a
better couple than you?

Why is everyone
so intense here?

sir, okay?

And I took AP law.

I have watched a
lot of lawyer shows,

and I get a phone call.

You're something,
Molly Jenkins.

Wow, you really love using
my full name, don't you?

Well, I mean, it's a...
it's a beautiful name.

Really?
Don't sue me for it, though,

'cause I think you'd win.

(laughs)
Th... that was funny, um...

Ugh,
has anyone ever told you that

you look exactly like...
Patrick J. Michaels?

Yes!
Yeah, get it all the time.

I don't see the resemblance,
though.

Really? Like... like really?

No.
I mean, you look

exactly like him.
Nope, don't see it at all.

My mom was like a
huge fan of his, though.

Was an extra in like,
all of his movies.

<i>All right, you two,
I got some news for you.</i>

<i>We got a call from
one of our other stations.</i>

<i>They arrested an
Addison Preston Roberts,</i>

<i>AKA Dr. SpaceCakes.</i>

<i>You're gonna be
good to go here soon.</i>

Told you he was real.

<i>Well,
what do you know?</i>

<i>Even cops can
be wrong sometimes.</i>

Would you relax?
Zoey's right.

Molly probably just
hooked up with that dude.

Oh, speaking of, you and Zoey
were pretty close last night.

Like, so close, she
should have pepper sprayed you.

What did you do?
What did you... did you...

Okay, the fact that
I'm having to pry you

for information right
now is freaking me out.

Did you guys
hook up or not?

I mean, we didn't...
we didn't "hook up" hook up.

We had an
emotional hookup.

I mean,
I... I played her my mix and...

You finally played her
that thing and she was into it?

Yeah, dude, she...
she loved it.

Wow.
(phone rings)

Molly? Molly?

Hey, are you okay?
Where are you?

Where?
Yes, we're coming right now.

All right.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Just a misunderstanding.

Okay, we gotta get her.

Okay, so we have to go get
our friend from jail.

Wow, you guys
must've had a wild night.

Are you coming or not?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

You okay?

Oh,
I... I'm fine.

Yeah?
Yeah.

No teardrop tattoos,
that's a good sign.

Yeah, no,
it's all good.

I was imprisoned
for another man's crime.

I'll give you the
CliffNotes version.

I was meeting a
friend who happened to have

narcotics on him,
and I basically unwittingly

ended up stepping
in on a sting operation

and the perp got away,
so they arrested us.

Us?

(door opening)

Thank you, officer.
I appreciate it.

We are all set,
completely good to go.

Ooh! Hi,
nice to meet you guys.

I've heard a lot about you.

Thank you, by the way, for
the ride to Front and Center,

I don't know
what I would've done.

Appreciate it, thanks.

This is my Sebastian.

(laughs nervously) Sorry, sorry!

My friend who's named Sebastian,
you're not mine....

You would think after
12 hours straight together

she'd be a little less
tongue tied around me.

I am not tongue tied,
I just, I just talk a lot.

I think it's cute.

I think it's
completely adorable.

I mean, hey, who
knew jail could be like, fun?

Hmm?

Is that Kale?

Yes, it is Kale, again!

Zoey, we can we please go?
It's already half past the hour.

Actually, he's right, we
should probably go to Front

and Center 'cause that's what
we traveled all the way for.

I'm gonna do
that. I'm gonna go.

"Half past the hour."
What are you like 50?

We have a little bit of an issue.
Yeah, I'll say.

Don't worry,
I'll get rid of him.

What? No, no, no.
I didn't get the wristbands.

The scalper
took all of your money.

Are you kidding me?
It's gonna be fine, okay?

Because Sebastian
actually knows people

that work at the festival,
so we should be good.

Great, great, our only chance
is a convicted felon, lovely.

Okay, I mean, we're not
technically convicted,

so like, let's not make
this worse than what it was.

Hey, doesn't he look exactly
like Patrick J. Michaels?

He looks nothing like
Patrick J. Michaels.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(indistinct chattering)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(chatter continues)

<i>â™ª I think that
I've found you out â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There was a place... â™ªâ™ªâ™ª</i>

<i>(techno music playing)</i>

<i>â™ª Wanna be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I think you're
running away f... â™ªâ™ªâ™ª</i>

<i>(techno music resumes)</i>

So plan A is like,
dental school,

but plan B is
the rap game.

Oh, that's...
that's a choice.

I mean, I think
it's a strong second choice.

You've gotta have options.
Yeah, I mean,

third choices
are good to... hi!

Molls,
we're getting close.

If he can't get us there,
let's just chuck him out.

Chuck him out?
What is wrong?

Just chill, all right?
Focus on you-know-who.

<i>(techno music playing)</i>

Don't you...
Don't you do it! Don't do it!

Mikey, Donnie,
stop it.

Yeah, guys,
come on, stop.

You're always agreeing
with my girl, huh?

What is that
supposed to mean?

It means tha...
It means

we should all
do a sing-a-long.

Am I right?
Not you, Sebastian.

(overlapping arguing,
music blasting)

(loud pop, all screaming)

(tires screeching,
screaming continues)

Poor guy.
Oh, is that a beak?

Yeah, I think that's
a huge ass bird.

You happy?
You killed Big Bird.

Nope, it's your fault.
I've had enough.

I'm calling a Lyft.
Zoey, pack up your things.

Oh, are you sure you don't
wanna pack them up for me?

'Cause you're so good at it.
Adorable.

Do you have your wristband?
No, Josh has them.

Well, come on, chop-chop,
little man, wristband.

The engine's screwed.
I can fix it, like I always do.

Don't touch my truck.
What is your deal, man?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I can explain, Donnie.

No, no, I know, I know,
'cause you explain everything.

How about this,
can you explain

what it's like to
be a kid one day

and then suddenly you
wake up and you're a parent?

Good luck fixing the truck.

I spent all our
money on the FTG

because I thought
this was our dream.

Look, I... I could
sell my wristband

to pay for the
damages. Donnie!

Josh,
I'm gonna need my wristband.


Where are the wristbands?


I don't know.

What do you mean
you don't know?

They're at will call.
Well...

But there's no will call
at Front and Center.

Hold on, I thought you said
you picked them up from like,

a Dr. SpaceCakes?

(nervous chuckle)

Wait, didn't your boss give them to you?
Yeah.

Josh?

Look,
I can explain.

I lied, I never had
any wristbands, guys.

Wait, what?
I knew it!

that took a turn.

Screw us, right?
Mikey, Mikey...

Look, it was my fault...
No, it's not your fault.

I was supposed to buy
the wristbands last night...

Yeah, no, of course
it's not her fault.

It's yours.
Why would you lie?

Because, darling, this was all
a plan to hook up with you.

What?
Which seems like

it almost worked.
What? No.

No,
nothing happened between us.

Then why did I hear Josh
bragging this morning

about your special night?

Look, Zoey,
I can explain...

Look, baby, baby, baby.
Whatever happened, happened,

all right?
I don't own you.

You're free to hook
up with whoever you want.

It's just a little bit
of a blow to the ego

that it was with
that pillock over there.

Okay, okay, nobody
hooked up with anybody.

(horn honking)

Look, let's just finish
this later, all right?

We don't even
need the wristbands,

we've got an in with the VIPs,
so let's just go.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Zoey...

Zoey! Zoey,
wait. Zoey, wait...

So this was all just
like a big plan to get me

on your diving board
and to play your stupid mix?

I thought we were connecting.
I thought I was speaking

to somebody
who was being sincere.

Even if we
had hooked up, like,

what did you think
was gonna happen?

'Cause I know. Nothing.

I would have
woken up the next day

and I would
have still gone to L.A.

Grow up, dude.
You don't know me.

You don't
even know yourself.

I think maybe we should
just get in the Lyft and go.

I mean,
we're here.

You're going too?

You know what? Fine, go.
Go have fun at the festival.

Can you just hold on a second?
Josh!

Go have fun with
your new friend.


Are you serious
right now? Fun?

Dude,
I came here to help you.

I was just
released from jail.

Your cellmate,
he's waiting.

No.

No,
you don't get to do this, Josh.

You don't get to dump
your emotions out on me

and then act
like it's my fault.

I am your wingwoman.
I am your best friend.

I...

I've been here.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(car engine starting)

Let's go.

(loud grunt)

(cell phone ringing)

Where's my essay?

I was,
uh...

I don't have it.

I didn't do it. So,
you know what, just fail me

'cause I don't care
about the essay anymore.

<i>That's not what
I was expecting</i>

to hear you say,
Mr. Torres.

You told me you'd
get me the essay today.

I don't care about
the essay, Mr. Elmer.

I'm stranded in middle of
nowhere and my life is a mess.

Of course your life's a mess,
you're a teenager.

Yeah, but everything was
finally going the way I wanted.

You know, like in the movies.

The movies?
Hey, do me a favor.

Just calm down,
okay?

<i>Are you calm?</i>
Yeah.

Hey, I'm not your
therapist, okay? But...

<i>you're a
nice kid. I actually</i>

dislike you
less than the others.

They annoy me like crazy.

<i>So let me give
you a piece of advice.</i>

Don't place your happiness
into something that's not real,

but in something that is.

<i>I read that once
in a fortune cookie.</i>

Tsui Hangs,
best Chinese in town.

It's too late, Mr. Elmer.
It's over.

High school's over,
you were right.

The weekend isn't over.
Get that essay to me.

I'm gonna fix it,
I promise.

Uh-huh.

I didn't... I didn't handle
the situation ideally.

You lied to me.

I'm sorry.

I'm not gonna go, Donnie.
I made a commitment to you...

Stop!
Would you just stop?

Stop? Stop being honest
with you? Stop telling...

Are you
trying to piss me off?

I can't win with you.
Everything I say pisses you off.

I'm not upset that you
applied to college, Mikey.

I'm upset that
you kept it from me.

How...

How could you think
that I wouldn't support you?

This is your dream,
this, this...

This is everything to you.

No, man,
you are.

I'm not...

I'm not perfect,
you know?

But I'm gonna keep
doing what's best for you.

You want to go to school,

so we'll use my
savings and we get you there.

You're going.

Oh my God.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

I'm sorry I tried to murder
you in a motel swimming pool.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

All right,
that should do it.

Come on,
now, here we go.

(engine screeches, starts)

Yes!

All right, so I was thinking
we go to the Motel Mermaid,

then once the girls
wrap up at the festival,

we all head home,
cool?

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª If I had
to walk today â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª I would
throw it all away â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª 'Cause all I need â™ª

â™ª Is you â™ª

(paper rustling)

â™ª All I need â™ª

â™ª Is you â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Stop the truck.

Guys,
stop the truck!

(tires screeching)

You okay?

How do you know you're
in love, Goosie?

What?

It's from
a Patrick J. Michaels movie.

He says,
"You feel it."

But that's the thing,
man, this isn't a movie.

I'm not
Patrick J. Michaels.

No one's
actually named Goosie.

I've been sidelined
under the bleachers living life

like it's a movie,
chasing feelings,

too afraid to
face reality. Well...

I'm done with it,
man.

Get me to Front
and Center, guys.

No idea what you're
talking about, but I'm in.

Kid's taking a swing,
I like it.

Front and Center,
boys.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Got me feeling
like I'm okay â™ª

â™ª But the feeling
never goes away... â™ª

You guys
getting anything?

Why aren't they answering?

Straight to voicemail.
Nothing.

Their
phone's gotta be dead.

They must be deep
in the festival by now.

We got no money,
no wristbands,

and it'll be a
miracle if this truck holds up

long enough
to get us there.

Wait,
Donnie.

What's the best thing
about Front and Center?

The music?


guild that comes with it.

(laughing)
I like it!

The Falcon's
going into business, baby!

â™ª You got me feeling
like I'm okay â™ª

â™ª The feeling
never goes away â™ª

â™ª Hate the night,
embrace the day â™ª

â™ª The feeling's
fleeting and it goes away â™ª

â™ª You got me
feeling like I'm okay â™ª

â™ª The feeling
never goes away â™ª

â™ª Hate the night,
embrace the day â™ª

â™ª The feeling's
fleeting and it goes â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Ooh... â™ª

â™ª Oh no, no â™ª

â™ª Ooh... â™ª

â™ª Oh no,
no â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª God,
change my philosophy â™ª

â™ª My state of
mind is in disguise â™ª

â™ª I'm losing
all the honesty â™ª

â™ª Arresting all
the life inside â™ª

â™ª Tell me that
I'll be all right â™ª

â™ª I tried myself,
and came up dry â™ª

â™ª Give me
more that satisfies â™ª

â™ª If you're okay,
then I'm okay â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª You got me
feeling like I'm okay â™ª

â™ª The feeling
never goes away â™ª

â™ª Own the night,
embrace the day â™ª

â™ª The feeling's
fleeting and it goes away â™ª

â™ª You got me
feeling like I'm okay â™ª

â™ª The feeling
never goes away... â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

sure this is the right place?

There's no way this
is going to work.

Uh, yeah, it is.
He told us to meet 'em here.

(knocking on window)

Guys, guys,
I'm gonna need to see

your health and zoning permit,
and your parking pass, please.

Funny, funny that you
should ask for that.

These guys are with me.

Hey, we're good.
we're good.

Hey, enjoy your stay, guys.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ciao.

Familia!
Hey!

So, this the famous
Milleni-Yum Falcon, eh?

Oh yeah,
she's... vintage.

Hey,
thanks for helping us out.

Can't abandon a member of
the guild now, can I?

When in Rome.
<i>Va bene.</i>

<i>Va bene!</i>

I'm gonna ride with you guys.
Yeah, yeah, jump on in.

(bangs on hood)
They're with me!

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(doors opening)

(distant cheering)

(cheering intensifies)

out of the way.

Come on,
move aside, move aside.

Thank you,
thank you. Move it over.

Right over here,
boys, right over here.

Yeah,
watch yourself.

Perfect.


All right, boys,
make me proud.

I'll check on you later.
All right.

Well, what's the move?
Okay, Kale said

something
about a VIP tent.

Like that one?

There it is, it's at some
rose bungalow village.

All right, we got
a plan this time?

No.

I don't need one.

You remember Sophia,
right, the art dealer?

Anyway,
she's agreed to meet me here.

Yeah, remember when all
the clothes were in my closet?

Why is your energy
red lining?

You know, I don't know, Kale.
Maybe it's because

I thought that you
came here to be with me,

but really I was just
another stop on your way.

No, no, no, no.
That couldn't be further from the truth.

This is all about you,
babe.

This is just a happy accident,
like the cosmos.

Come on,
let's get a move on.

(cheering and applause)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(cork pops, whooping)

I'm sorry about
the wristbands,

and lying to you,
that was...

No,
don't... don't worry about it.

I mean, like,
not calculating the risk

is actually on brand for me,
right?

Look, psychology is
not an exact science.

Some would say
there's a lot of guesswork.

No, no,
I think it was like,

exactly what I needed to hear,
actually.

Um,
how did it go

with the Mr.
Bowling Shirt?

I... nothing happened.

Like,
we talked. He's nice.

We were in jail,
that kind of complicated things.

He's definitely very cute.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

To Front and Center.

Cheers.

Well, this tent's
nice and all, but, um...

How 'bout we
get outta here?

Lovelytheband's
taking the stage soon.

Okay.

Hey, Zoey,
you wanna come?

Um, you know, I'm going
to catch you later I think.

Are you good?
Yes.

Ready?
Yeah.



Love it!
Absolutely love it.

They're going
mental out there.

Hey, Kale.
One sec.

Kale.

Just give me a second.

Babe! My Birkenstocks!

Babe! Babe, babe,
babe. What's going on?

I'm in the middle of
connecting with Sophia.

All right? Just hang out here,
soak in the vibes.

This is what our
life's gonna be like in L.A.

I know,
so I'm leaving.

All right,
I will catch you later.

No, Kale. I'm leaving.

Wait, you're not
coming to L.A.?

No.
Well, why? Why not?

Why the... why the change?

(Zoey sighs)

L.A. is your dream, Kale,
it's...

It's not mine.

This is what's
best for both of us.

â™ª Ohh... â™ª

â™ª Ohh... â™ª

â™ª Ohh... â™ª

â™ª Ohh... â™ª

Zoey?

Hey.

How... what...
what're you doing here?

I had some unfinished
business...

What're you... wait,
where's...

Where's Kale?

I, uh...

broke up with him.

You did?

Yep, I did.

I'm so sorry
if I did anything...

No, no. Although
you did, you know,

drag us out here
and lie about it, but...

if it weren't for you,
I'd probably be

in L.A. right
now hating life, so...

I actually feel kind of
liberated or something.

And I just want to
make something clear

between the two of us.

I like you,

but just as a friend.

And that's
all it's gonna be.

That's fine, because I only
want to be friends, too.

I mean,
for the longest time

I actually
thought I loved you.

Yeah, no, I know.
No, like full-on,

thought of you
all night love you.

Oh, wow, okay,
got it.

But here's the thing.
Over this past weekend, I...

Yeah, Josh, every girl knows
when a guy is into them,

and every girl knows when
a guy is into somebody else.

So what are you doing here?
Where is she?

She went with Sebastian
to go see Lovelytheband

and I think that you
should move quick, fast.

Go, go, go,
go.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Wait, I thought that we
were gonna see Lovelytheband.

There's like,
a great spot like, right there.

Oh, yeah, yeah,
no, no, no, I know, but, um...

I know a better one.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Shall we?

Oh, man, these
are really good.

Yes!
Oh yeah.

Here, get in on this.
Oh yeah!

the best grilled cheeses.

is talking about them.

(indistinct chatter)

We've officially sold out!
Thank you, Front and Center!

But the Milleni-Yum Falcon
is jumping to light speed.

And may the fromage
be with you.

(all groaning)

Hey!
Looks like you guys

are already in business.

Oh, you know, just
for one night, cuz.

Oh, and we officially
have enough money

to make it home.
Oh, great.

Just in time too,
Lovelytheband's about to take the stage.

Oh,
are you alone right now?

Yeah, yeah, I am, it's, uh,
it's a new thing I'm trying.

Get used to it.

Wait,
where's our boy?

started singing yet?

Ladies and gentlemen.

And now, the moment
you've been waiting for.

Please welcome Lovelytheband!

(cheering and applause)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Dancing in
your party dress â™ª

â™ª You were singing me â™ª

â™ª Some Frank Sinatra â™ª

â™ª As you wept â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

â™ª Pull me close enough â™ª

â™ª It seems like we lost touch â™ª

â™ª So hold me as
the record skips â™ª

(music continues in distance)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Wow...

This is so beautiful.

I think you're beautiful.

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(music continues)

(fireworks exploding)

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

(music fades,
cheering continues)

(music pauses)


â™ª Maybe I'm just too good
Maybe I'll run away â™ª

â™ª Maybe I'm over you
Maybe I shouldn't stay â™ª

â™ª Maybe I just don't
care Maybe I talk too much â™ª

â™ª But baby, I'll be there Yeah,
baby, I'll be there â™ª

â™ª It's been a little hard... â™ª

Um, you know,
actually,

um, no, uh...

What's wrong?

Uhh...

Okay, well,
for starters,

we... we... we like,
just met, right?

Like, mere hours ago.
And... and you have technically

not asked me on,
like, a formal date,

and, uh, we don't
know each other, like, at all.

Look, I think you should just
maybe relax for a second, okay?

And just
chill. Let's just...

Let's just have some fun.

Full disclosure,
um...

I just want to hang out.

And, um,
if that does not

float your battleship...

Uh...

I'm a big girl.

I'll understand.

It was nice meeting you,
Molly Jenkins.


So long,
Patrick J. Michaels.

(fireworks exploding)

â™ª You always smell
like a holiday â™ª

â™ª I'm still in love with you,
though â™ª

â™ª It was springtime â™ª

â™ª You were still mine â™ª

â™ª Back when I felt whole â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)

Hi.

I like you.

Do you like me?

Yeah.

Yeah,
I really do.

I'm sorry I missed
the fireworks.

I was running
through the field

and I jumped
on top of this car...

â™ª I'll be
your right now â™ª

â™ª I'll be your forever â™ª

â™ª Oh,
I'll be your last call... â™ª

It was never about
the fireworks.

Well?

â™ª She said she really
likes Springsteen â™ª

â™ª And I think
I like that a lot â™ª

â™ª A flower
child of the '70s â™ª

â™ª At least she
thought that she was â™ª

â™ª She was wild,
she was dangerous â™ª

â™ª In all the best ways â™ª

â™ª With a heart like that â™ª

â™ª She was never
meant to be tamed â™ª

(â™ªâ™ªâ™ª)



Come on up!
Come on up here!

â™ª I'll be
your right now â™ª

â™ª I'll be your forever â™ª

â™ª Oh,
I'll be your last call... â™ª


it's funny.

If you would
have told me yesterday

I was chasing
after a false dream,

that I was trying to live
a movie version of myself,

I would have
said you're crazy.

I guess sometimes you've
gotta fall before you realize

you were walking
in the wrong direction.

How was my high
school experience?

One of waking up.

And you know
what I realized?

Life isn't a movie.

It's better.

â™ª I'll be
your right now â™ª

â™ª I'll be your forever â™ª

â™ª Oh,
I'll be your last call â™ª
